00:14.170 --> 00:16.204
MAN: You got any
jumper cables?

00:16.239 --> 00:18.039
It won't start.

00:20.009 --> 00:22.177
(breathing heavily)

00:37.226 --> 00:38.193
Hey, sis.

00:38.227 --> 00:40.061
Good run?

00:40.096 --> 00:41.229
I'm not your sister.

00:41.264 --> 00:43.131
Okay, foster sister.

00:43.165 --> 00:45.133
Like that better,
anyways.

00:45.167 --> 00:47.068
So many more possibilities.

00:47.103 --> 00:48.169
You are such a perv.

00:48.204 --> 00:49.237
You so read things
into what I say.

00:49.272 --> 00:50.305
I don't think so.

00:50.339 --> 00:51.306
Now, if you don't mind...

00:51.340 --> 00:53.341
Only if you close those blinds.

00:56.078 --> 00:57.212
(door slams)

00:57.246 --> 00:59.214
(computer trilling)

00:59.248 --> 01:01.016
(gasps)

01:01.050 --> 01:03.285
Hey.

01:03.319 --> 01:05.019
Hey. There you are.

01:05.054 --> 01:06.087
We just got back to Phoenix.

01:06.122 --> 01:08.089
Wait. Wait. Don't...

01:08.124 --> 01:09.291
Let me look at you.

01:09.325 --> 01:12.027
My twin sister.

01:12.061 --> 01:13.328
I still cannot get over this.

01:13.362 --> 01:16.064
Oh, it's been three months.

01:16.098 --> 01:18.066
Just get over it. (laughing)

01:18.100 --> 01:19.968
I just can't wait
to finally meet you.

01:20.002 --> 01:21.136
Hey, and now that you're home...

01:21.170 --> 01:23.204
I know, I know,
I'm really excited, too,

01:23.239 --> 01:25.373
but you understand
why we have to wait.

01:25.408 --> 01:28.143
Yeah, I know. You're searching
for our real parents.

01:28.177 --> 01:30.111
And if it wasn't
for that search,

01:30.146 --> 01:31.279
I never would have found you.

01:31.314 --> 01:32.981
Yeah.

01:33.015 --> 01:34.282
What?

01:34.317 --> 01:38.086
Just... the couple
that adopted you

01:38.120 --> 01:39.254
sound really cool.

01:39.288 --> 01:41.256
I mean,
they obviously love you.

01:41.290 --> 01:43.058
Then why did they lie to me?

01:43.092 --> 01:45.060
Well, maybe they're just
trying to protect you.

01:45.094 --> 01:47.062
No. They want to protect
themselves, okay?

01:47.096 --> 01:50.265
They lied; they knew that I had
a twin and they didn't tell me.

01:50.299 --> 01:52.200
Why wouldn't they just tell me?

01:52.234 --> 01:55.203
You know what?
No, I'm going to tell you why.

01:55.237 --> 01:59.341
Because they did
something horrible,

01:59.375 --> 02:01.309
Emma, but it's fine,

02:01.344 --> 02:03.311
because I'm back,

02:03.346 --> 02:06.982
and I'm on it, and soon enough,

02:07.016 --> 02:08.216
I'm going to find out
the answers.

02:08.250 --> 02:10.085
Okay.

02:10.119 --> 02:14.155
I always say,
"Hope is grief's best music."

02:14.190 --> 02:16.157
That's really brilliant, Emma.

02:16.192 --> 02:18.960
You got the smart half
of the embryo, didn't you?

02:18.995 --> 02:21.062
It's something I read
in a book.

02:21.097 --> 02:22.197
Who are you talking to?

02:22.231 --> 02:23.231
None of your business!

02:47.356 --> 02:48.356
(doorbell rings)

02:50.426 --> 02:53.161
Hey, Laurel,
welcome home.

02:53.195 --> 02:54.262
Is Sutton here?

02:54.296 --> 02:56.164
Luke, I'm afraid
I have bad news.

02:56.198 --> 02:58.233
Sutton was killed in a tragic
barge accident on the Seine,

02:58.267 --> 03:01.202
making me the last
available Mercer female.

03:01.237 --> 03:03.304
Laurel, stop!

03:03.339 --> 03:05.306
Luke, don't listen to her.

03:05.341 --> 03:07.242
I wouldn't think of it,
Mrs. Mercer.

03:07.276 --> 03:08.243
Welcome home.

03:08.277 --> 03:09.310
How was Paris?

03:09.345 --> 03:10.979
I had a wonderful time.
Ah.

03:11.013 --> 03:13.081
Nearly perfect.

03:13.115 --> 03:16.217
Do you believe Sutton turned
down our day at the museum?

03:16.252 --> 03:17.952
Don't start, Mom.

03:17.987 --> 03:19.954
Hey.
Hey.

03:19.989 --> 03:21.156
You can still go with Laurel.

03:21.190 --> 03:22.323
LAUREL:
Yeah, absolutely.

03:22.358 --> 03:24.025
Besides, I'm sure

03:24.060 --> 03:25.360
you and Luke have a lot of,
you know...

03:25.394 --> 03:27.028
catching up to do.

03:28.264 --> 03:29.998
Hey, Luke.

03:30.032 --> 03:32.100
Hey. Nice to see you.
Good summer?

03:32.134 --> 03:33.968
Oh, it was pretty boring
without Sutton around,

03:34.003 --> 03:35.937
but what are
you gonna do?

03:35.971 --> 03:37.405
Okay, I'm gonna go, 'cause
this is really weird.

03:37.440 --> 03:39.307
I'm going to Char's
house; she's having

03:39.341 --> 03:41.009
a welcome home thing
going for me.

03:41.043 --> 03:42.243
Luke.
See ya.

03:42.278 --> 03:43.445
Everything unpacked?

03:44.980 --> 03:46.247
Mm.
(door closes)

03:46.282 --> 03:48.016
My mistake,
discussing things

03:48.050 --> 03:50.051
Honey...
in front of the boyfriend.

03:50.086 --> 03:52.120
Daughters pull away
from their mothers.

03:52.154 --> 03:54.089
That's a natural part
of growing up.

03:56.325 --> 03:58.126
We did the right thing.

03:58.160 --> 04:00.295
We did all we could.

04:00.329 --> 04:02.297
I hope so.

04:07.303 --> 04:09.170
Whoa, whoo!

04:09.205 --> 04:10.405
(laughs)

04:12.208 --> 04:13.274
I missed you.

04:13.309 --> 04:14.976
Me, too.

04:15.010 --> 04:16.911
Really?
'Cause I barely heard from you.

04:16.946 --> 04:21.916
I just... It was crazy busy,
and I got distracted.

04:21.951 --> 04:24.252
But even before you left,
you were acting kind of weird.

04:24.286 --> 04:29.924
Look, it's... just something
I need to work out on my own.

04:29.959 --> 04:31.159
You get that, right?

04:33.262 --> 04:36.131
Okay, so, if it's okay,

04:36.165 --> 04:38.366
I need a girlfriend fix.

04:40.102 --> 04:42.003
See you tomorrow?

04:47.409 --> 04:49.077
(grunting)

04:58.420 --> 05:00.388
Kind of a waste
of time, isn't it?

05:00.422 --> 05:03.124
Your school doesn't
even have a tennis team.

05:05.127 --> 05:07.095
And even if it
did, it's not...

05:09.331 --> 05:11.132
What's the idea?

05:11.167 --> 05:14.102
Bash it hard enough,
you escape this messed-up life?

05:16.105 --> 05:18.106
Don't touch me.

05:18.140 --> 05:19.374
Why not?

05:19.408 --> 05:21.976
Emma, you need to, like,
accept your situation here.

05:22.011 --> 05:24.045
In my mind...
You don't have a mind.

05:24.079 --> 05:26.080
There's five and a half inches
between your ears,

05:26.115 --> 05:27.949
and it's basically empty.

05:27.983 --> 05:29.050
So just stay the hell
away from me.

05:29.084 --> 05:32.320
WOMAN: Emma! Travis!
Get in here!

05:35.090 --> 05:37.258
$500,
including a hundred-dollar tip

05:37.293 --> 05:41.062
signed by none other
than Mr. Bruce Willis himself.

05:41.096 --> 05:42.397
Who got into my kitty?

05:42.431 --> 05:44.299
Ma, I didn't even know you had a kitty.
Emma?

05:44.333 --> 05:46.000
Oh, I get it.

05:46.035 --> 05:48.002
I-I see what this is.

05:48.037 --> 05:49.003
Yeah, you're a klepto.

05:49.038 --> 05:50.071
Ma. check her backpack.

05:50.105 --> 05:51.139
Think I will.

05:51.173 --> 05:53.074
Clarice, don't
you get it?

05:53.108 --> 05:55.143
He took your money; he
takes it all the time.

05:55.177 --> 05:58.012
"To my lucky penny, Clarice.

05:58.047 --> 05:59.180
Love, Bruce Willis."

05:59.215 --> 06:01.049
He took it.

06:01.083 --> 06:03.017
You are so full of it.
Be quiet, both of you.

06:03.052 --> 06:05.019
Social Services said
if anything like this happens,

06:05.054 --> 06:06.321
I'm supposed to call the cops.

06:06.355 --> 06:09.991
And that's just what
I think I'm going to do.

06:10.025 --> 06:11.926
Watch her, Travis.

06:14.029 --> 06:15.997
GIRL:
<i>Ah, love it.</i>

06:16.031 --> 06:17.999
The outfit, the hair...
Good old Sutton.

06:18.033 --> 06:20.068
We barely survived without you,
right, Mads?

06:20.102 --> 06:21.903
Somehow we managed.

06:21.937 --> 06:23.071
Hi.
Hi.

06:23.105 --> 06:25.073
We just missed having
our "orifice."

06:25.107 --> 06:27.008
Actually,
that's "oracle."

06:27.042 --> 06:30.078
I'm sure you guys
were great without me.

06:30.112 --> 06:31.312
Hey, Char,
how's your mom?

06:31.347 --> 06:33.014
Oh, great.

06:33.048 --> 06:34.983
Out of rehab.
Detoxing.

06:35.017 --> 06:36.050
Getting lots of sleep.

06:36.085 --> 06:39.187
So no change,
in other words.

06:39.221 --> 06:40.321
It's okay.

06:40.356 --> 06:42.090
And if you want
to talk about it...

06:42.124 --> 06:44.158
No way. I'm not going
to let it get me down.

06:44.193 --> 06:46.060
School's about to start,
Sutton's back,

06:46.095 --> 06:47.929
all's right with the world.

06:47.963 --> 06:49.998
How's Thayer?

06:50.032 --> 06:52.100
You talk to him, right?

06:52.134 --> 06:53.201
Ah, occasionally.

06:53.235 --> 06:54.235
What about you?

06:54.270 --> 06:56.237
Yeah. Couple times.

06:56.272 --> 06:58.139
He seems to
really like L.A.

06:58.173 --> 07:01.976
Well, freaks me out Thayer
would just leave like that.

07:02.011 --> 07:04.879
I mean, you and your brother
were so close, Mads.

07:04.914 --> 07:06.047
WOMAN:
Chars, come here!

07:06.081 --> 07:07.949
Duty calls.

07:10.019 --> 07:10.985
Yikes.

07:11.020 --> 07:13.087
Um...

07:16.258 --> 07:18.226
I found it
in the back of a drawer,

07:18.260 --> 07:20.995
and I don't recognize the place.

07:23.065 --> 07:25.934
This was up in the hills.

07:25.968 --> 07:28.036
Um... hiking trip,

07:28.070 --> 07:29.904
I think.

07:29.939 --> 07:32.040
You must've been
sick or something.

07:34.076 --> 07:38.179
So, I gotta ask...

07:38.213 --> 07:40.949
you and Thayer...

07:40.983 --> 07:45.053
you were never more than
just friends, right?

07:45.087 --> 07:47.055
Please. No.

07:47.089 --> 07:49.157
He's your brother.

07:49.191 --> 07:50.992
I mean, he's
like my brother.

07:51.026 --> 07:52.193
Sorry.

07:52.227 --> 07:53.895
Just curious.

07:53.929 --> 07:55.196
It's okay.

08:02.137 --> 08:04.105
Wait here.

08:04.139 --> 08:06.140
I'll go get them.

08:10.045 --> 08:11.913
That didn't take long.

08:11.947 --> 08:15.049
Ma's going to give them
an earful.

08:15.084 --> 08:17.151
You know, I still might
be able to help you out here.

08:17.186 --> 08:19.187
Promise me a little action,

08:19.221 --> 08:21.923
and I can make those cops
go away.

08:21.957 --> 08:25.893
I mean, you are getting kind
of close to three strikes.

08:29.264 --> 08:31.232
(grunts)
(groans)

08:31.266 --> 08:34.068
Ma, she's going out
the backdoor.

08:34.102 --> 08:36.104
(Emma panting)

08:38.039 --> 08:39.039
(grunts)

08:40.109 --> 08:42.143
(engine accelerating)

08:42.177 --> 08:44.011
(police siren chirps)

08:44.046 --> 08:46.080
POLICE OFFICER (over speaker):
Stop right there!

08:49.801 --> 08:51.637
You just ditched him?

08:51.965 --> 08:53.032
SUTTON:
Luke can wait.

08:53.066 --> 08:55.935
I wanted to be with
my best friends.

08:55.969 --> 08:58.871
But, God,
Luke's, like, your boyfriend.

08:58.906 --> 09:00.840
I know that.

09:00.874 --> 09:02.008
So do you want

09:02.042 --> 09:04.944
to break up with him,
are you cheating, or both?

09:04.978 --> 09:06.779
None of the above.

09:06.813 --> 09:07.847
So...

09:08.982 --> 09:10.983
Come on, share.

09:12.986 --> 09:14.954
It's complicated.

09:14.988 --> 09:16.889
I found something
out, and it

09:16.924 --> 09:20.726
may be the first thing
I can't share with you guys.

09:22.896 --> 09:24.730
(phone chimes)

09:24.765 --> 09:27.733
I have to
take this.

09:31.038 --> 09:34.073
Sounds like family stuff.

09:35.976 --> 09:38.844
It's always
family stuff.

09:38.879 --> 09:39.946
Emma, what's up?

09:39.980 --> 09:41.047
I'm coming to Phoenix tonight.

09:41.081 --> 09:42.748
There's an all-night bus.

09:42.783 --> 09:43.783
Whoa, back up.

09:43.817 --> 09:44.984
Look, my pervy foster brother

09:45.018 --> 09:47.720
set me up
and said I was stealing.

09:47.754 --> 09:48.854
I have nowhere else to go.

09:50.724 --> 09:52.692
Sutton?

09:52.726 --> 09:53.793
Sutton, are you there?

09:53.827 --> 09:56.929
Yeah, just thinking.

09:56.964 --> 09:58.731
I know that you said
that you didn't want

09:58.765 --> 10:00.099
to spring this
on your adopted family, but...

10:00.133 --> 10:02.034
N-No, that's okay,
we'll work it out.

10:02.069 --> 10:05.004
What time does your bus get in?
8:50 a.m.

10:05.038 --> 10:07.807
Okay, yeah, I'll be there
to pick you up at the station.

10:07.841 --> 10:09.875
(bus engine starts)

10:09.910 --> 10:12.745
I got to go.

10:34.935 --> 10:37.903
Let me get that bag for you.
<i>Okay, that sounds good, I'll see you.</i>

10:37.938 --> 10:40.873
(woman speaking Spanish)
<i>Yeah, sorry, just give me a minute.</i>

10:40.907 --> 10:43.009
(woman laughs)
<i>Okay, guys.</i>

10:46.913 --> 10:50.049
(indistinct chatter)

10:51.985 --> 10:53.986
(garbled radio transmission)

11:00.894 --> 11:02.895
(gasps)

11:11.772 --> 11:13.806
It's you.

11:13.840 --> 11:16.642
It's me in the flesh.

11:16.676 --> 11:19.845
On the computer, it just
never felt real, you know?

11:19.880 --> 11:21.080
Yeah, I know.

11:21.114 --> 11:23.049
Everything about us
it the same:

11:23.083 --> 11:24.884
the hair and the eyes.

11:24.918 --> 11:26.085
Look, we don't have
a lot of time.

11:26.119 --> 11:27.987
For what?

11:31.124 --> 11:33.092
Okay, I can't go
into detail,

11:33.126 --> 11:36.028
but last night, I got a
lead on our real parents.

11:36.063 --> 11:37.930
What, you found them?
I don't know.

11:37.964 --> 11:39.932
There've been a lot of dead ends
till now.

11:39.966 --> 11:42.968
But here's the problem:
this lead leads to Los Angeles.

11:43.003 --> 11:46.038
So you want me to go to L.A.?

11:46.073 --> 11:47.873
No. I'm gonna go to L.A.

11:47.908 --> 11:49.809
and you're gonna stay
here and cover for me.

11:49.843 --> 11:51.777
My adoptives would
never get this.

11:51.812 --> 11:54.046
They would just freak out
and blow everything.

11:55.982 --> 11:57.883
WOMAN:
Hello?

11:57.918 --> 11:59.051
(clattering)

11:59.086 --> 12:01.053
Just a minute.
We need to change clothes.

12:01.088 --> 12:02.922
Wait a minute.
Let me get this straight.

12:02.956 --> 12:04.623
You-you-you want me
to take your place?

12:04.658 --> 12:06.992
Two days. Just hang out,
relax, enjoy.

12:07.027 --> 12:08.094
You said you envy

12:08.128 --> 12:09.762
everything I've got.

12:09.796 --> 12:10.963
I never really said "envy."

12:10.997 --> 12:12.832
Look, you're in this trouble,
right?

12:12.866 --> 12:14.100
So what better place
to hide out?

12:14.134 --> 12:16.969
Like I said this summer,
my sister's totally annoying

12:17.003 --> 12:18.971
and my parents lied to me.

12:19.005 --> 12:20.840
Anything else you need to know
is on my computer.

12:20.874 --> 12:22.808
Has my whole life
on that thing.

12:22.843 --> 12:23.976
Oh...

12:24.010 --> 12:25.744
Take this.

12:25.779 --> 12:27.046
The other key to
me-- my phone.

12:27.080 --> 12:29.715
I have so wanted one of these.
Okay, well, that was envy.

12:29.749 --> 12:32.017
Oh, I do this hair flip thing.

12:32.052 --> 12:33.786
So, like this?

12:34.855 --> 12:37.890
I don't even know your address.

12:37.924 --> 12:39.959
My BMW's in the parking lot.
Nav system has my address.

12:39.993 --> 12:41.894
Just push "preset one,"
she'll take you right home.

12:41.928 --> 12:45.064
So I just... be you.
Mm-hmm.

12:45.098 --> 12:47.766
Don't say anything
to anybody,

12:47.801 --> 12:50.769
especially my so-called parents.

12:50.804 --> 12:53.973
Look, I'm gonna find
our real parents.

12:54.007 --> 12:55.875
I'm gonna find the truth.

12:55.909 --> 12:58.811
Come her

13:03.950 --> 13:05.951
(trash can clatters)

13:05.986 --> 13:09.855
BOTH:
Dude! A little privacy?

13:09.890 --> 13:13.692
So, in two days
we'll meet up at the cabin.

13:13.727 --> 13:14.860
"Preset four"
on the nav system.

13:14.895 --> 13:16.862
10:00 p.m., two days only,
I promise.

13:16.897 --> 13:18.030
If I had a day with you...

13:18.064 --> 13:19.832
Yeah, this L.A. thing
can't wait.

13:19.866 --> 13:21.700
Oh, and the boyfriend sitch,

13:21.735 --> 13:23.068
you should really know about
that-- it's complicated.

13:23.103 --> 13:25.971
Hey, look,
I'm gonna call ya, okay?

13:38.051 --> 13:40.953
WOMAN: All right, have a great trip.
Call me.

13:47.060 --> 13:48.894
(car alarm chirps)

13:52.933 --> 13:54.733
(chuckles)

14:19.727 --> 14:23.796
(COMPUTER VOICE)
After 600 feet, turn left.

14:33.707 --> 14:34.774
You have arrived.

14:34.808 --> 14:36.543
Oh, my God.

15:11.579 --> 15:13.646
Sutton, there you are.

15:13.681 --> 15:15.381
Sure came home
late last night.

15:15.416 --> 15:17.550
Then out again first thing
this morning at... Oh!

15:17.585 --> 15:19.619
I got it.

15:19.653 --> 15:21.821
Um, where should I put this?

15:21.855 --> 15:23.489
Where it always goes.

15:23.524 --> 15:24.757
Thank you, Sutton.

15:26.760 --> 15:28.428
Sorry about this morning.

15:28.462 --> 15:29.696
I just had stuff
I had to do.

15:29.730 --> 15:31.731
What, pawning
Grandma's necklace?

15:31.765 --> 15:33.600
Oh, my God,
I don't think

15:33.634 --> 15:34.734
I've ever seen you without it.

15:34.768 --> 15:37.503
Luke probably took
it off last night

15:37.538 --> 15:38.838
to give you a proper
"Welcome home" hickey.

15:38.872 --> 15:41.674
By the way, Mads asked me
to swim with you guys.

15:41.709 --> 15:43.610
She can't wait to see
r new bikinis.

15:43.644 --> 15:45.745
Don't suppose
I can have a ride.

15:45.779 --> 15:48.548
Yeah, I guess.

15:48.582 --> 15:53.686
Hey, look, I'm sure that
the necklace will turn up.

15:53.721 --> 15:55.622
I hope so.
Something happened to it,

15:55.656 --> 15:56.756
your grandmother
will be devastated.

15:56.790 --> 15:59.492
And we would never hear
the end of it.

15:59.526 --> 16:02.528
Bunch of shirts if anybody's
going by the dry cleaners.

16:02.563 --> 16:04.530
It has to wait till Monday.
Unless,

16:04.565 --> 16:06.666
Sutton, on your way...
Sure, no problem.

16:06.700 --> 16:08.401
Oh, my God, that's twice.

16:08.435 --> 16:09.502
Laurel...

16:09.536 --> 16:11.371
Anything else you need me to do?

16:11.405 --> 16:12.639
Okay, that's it.

16:12.673 --> 16:14.707
Who are you and what have
you done with my daughter?

16:17.711 --> 16:21.381
(chuckles)
I'm off.

16:21.415 --> 16:23.383
See ya.
Have a good day.

16:23.417 --> 16:25.585
(phone chimes)
Hello. Hey.

16:45.439 --> 16:47.607
(sighs)

16:54.682 --> 16:57.417
"Wear your bikini."

16:59.687 --> 17:02.488
Oh, you've got to be kidding me.

17:08.695 --> 17:10.363
Okay.

17:10.396 --> 17:12.632
Okay, Emma,
let's channel Sutton.

17:12.665 --> 17:15.401
Sutton, Sutton, Sutton.

17:15.435 --> 17:17.436
Char.

17:17.471 --> 17:19.305
Mads.

17:19.339 --> 17:21.574
Those shoes, I love them.

17:21.608 --> 17:23.608
Oh, pocket change.

17:23.644 --> 17:25.578
Paris? Paris was just...

17:25.612 --> 17:27.446
Paris... (laughs)

17:29.483 --> 17:30.583
Okay. (laughs)

17:31.585 --> 17:33.386
(breathy laugh)

17:34.588 --> 17:36.356
Luke. Luke. Luke.

17:37.391 --> 17:39.392
Luke. Luke. Lukey.

17:39.426 --> 17:41.461
Yo!
Oh, hi!

17:41.495 --> 17:44.597
We better get going
if you're still taking me.

17:44.631 --> 17:47.400
(quietly):
Okay.

17:51.672 --> 17:54.374
You drive.

17:54.408 --> 17:56.309
I'm sorry. What did you say?

17:56.343 --> 17:57.677
You have your permit, right?

17:57.711 --> 17:59.579
And you know the way to Mads'
house and the dry cleaners.

18:01.515 --> 18:04.617
I know I probably said I'd never
let you drive my car.

18:04.651 --> 18:07.553
Actually, you said "Never sit
in it," but not arguing.

18:07.588 --> 18:09.222
Not saying a word.

18:15.496 --> 18:17.563
Hey!

18:17.598 --> 18:19.298
Hey, Laurel,
where's Sutton?

18:19.333 --> 18:20.566
Right over there.

18:20.601 --> 18:22.602
CHAR:
Cute cover-up.

18:22.636 --> 18:24.437
You get that in Paris?

18:24.471 --> 18:27.273
And when did you get
so modest?

18:27.307 --> 18:28.574
CHAR:
Ooh-la-la!

18:28.609 --> 18:31.577
Stylish, sexy, sophisticated
and oh, so chic.

18:31.612 --> 18:33.346
You look great, babe.

18:33.380 --> 18:34.447
Thanks.

18:36.617 --> 18:38.418
You had a good summer?

18:38.452 --> 18:41.521
Yeah, we kinda went over
that last night.

18:42.623 --> 18:45.525
Right. Last night.

18:45.559 --> 18:47.493
(phone chimes)

18:47.528 --> 18:49.495
Hold on.

18:49.530 --> 18:51.264
Hello?

18:51.298 --> 18:52.432
It's me. Can you talk?

18:52.466 --> 18:53.633
Not really.

18:53.667 --> 18:55.301
It's going okay?

18:55.335 --> 18:56.636
Sort of.

18:56.670 --> 18:58.471
Good, 'cause it's going well here.
Who's that?

18:58.505 --> 19:00.506
I set up a meeting...
I gotta go. Call me later?

19:00.541 --> 19:04.277
When I get a chance.
Remember, two days, the cabin.

19:07.381 --> 19:09.449
My mom. Sorry.
What were we saying?

19:09.483 --> 19:12.285
I've just been
really distracted.

19:12.319 --> 19:14.253
I know. That's what you also
said last night.

19:14.288 --> 19:16.289
See? I'm so distracted,

19:16.323 --> 19:17.523
I completely forgot
about that. Sorry.

19:17.558 --> 19:22.261
But, hey, you look beautiful.

19:23.330 --> 19:25.264
Thanks.

19:28.202 --> 19:29.302
BOTH:
What did he say?

19:29.336 --> 19:32.405
He said I am beautiful.

19:32.439 --> 19:34.106
Aw.
Aw, you guys are so back.

19:34.141 --> 19:35.308
I was worried there
for a second.

19:35.342 --> 19:37.510
MADS: I dunno, Char,
kinda got

19:37.544 --> 19:39.479
the feeling there's something
Sutton's not telling us.

19:39.513 --> 19:44.350
Well, come on.
You know what they say.

19:44.384 --> 19:46.152
Boyfriend sitches,

19:46.186 --> 19:47.253
always complicated.
Always complicated.

19:47.287 --> 19:48.421
(laughter)

19:48.455 --> 19:51.224
(laughter continues)

19:54.228 --> 19:56.195
(screams)

20:03.237 --> 20:07.173
Huge party at my place
two nights from now.

20:07.207 --> 20:10.409
It's mostly seniors,
but you guys can come.

20:10.444 --> 20:14.180
Nisha, don't exactly remember
inviting you.

20:14.214 --> 20:15.314
Look who's finally home.

20:17.251 --> 20:18.551
How's the knee, Sutton?

20:18.585 --> 20:21.420
It's good.

20:21.455 --> 20:23.222
Ready to take you down, Nisha.

20:23.257 --> 20:26.425
(scoffs)
Wow. Shaking in my Nikes.

20:28.262 --> 20:29.428
Is that a challenge, Sutton?

20:31.298 --> 20:33.266
I-I guess it is.

20:33.300 --> 20:35.334
Well, you sure went down easily
last year.

20:35.369 --> 20:37.270
You know, people are
still saying you faked

20:37.304 --> 20:40.206
the knee
to avoid the humiliation.

20:40.240 --> 20:42.241
We'll just see what happens.

20:42.276 --> 20:44.210
How about tomorrow,
first day of practice,

20:44.244 --> 20:45.578
you against me.

20:45.612 --> 20:48.414
Then we'll see
who's number one.

20:48.448 --> 20:50.516
You're on.

20:50.551 --> 20:52.451
Good.

20:55.389 --> 20:56.489
Have a nice day.

20:59.626 --> 21:01.060
You okay?

21:01.094 --> 21:03.496
Yeah.

21:03.530 --> 21:06.265
(motorcycle approaching)

21:06.300 --> 21:08.334
I'll be ready for her.

21:08.368 --> 21:09.535
Nice work, babe.

21:11.338 --> 21:14.273
It's about time someone
stood up to her.

21:24.351 --> 21:27.453
Have Mom and Dad ever talked
about my adoption?

21:27.487 --> 21:30.423
You're kidding, right?

21:30.457 --> 21:33.492
I mean, anything more
than what they always say.

21:33.527 --> 21:36.228
Right, that they chose you
and that makes you special.

21:36.263 --> 21:39.332
Me, the big surprise, comes
along, like, ten months later.

21:39.366 --> 21:42.234
I read this thing
that said the baby

21:42.269 --> 21:44.236
of the family
always craves attention,

21:44.271 --> 21:48.307
which is why we tend to be
so obnoxious.

21:48.342 --> 21:51.243
I just think they aren't
telling us everything.

21:51.278 --> 21:53.179
Of course they're not--
they're parents.

21:53.213 --> 21:56.415
I'm getting the distinct
sense of dÃ©jÃ  vu.

21:56.450 --> 21:58.351
That conversation
on the plane home,

21:58.385 --> 22:00.453
you asked, "Who has a child
and just gives it away?"

22:02.356 --> 22:05.291
Obviously you were talking about
who gave you up.

22:05.325 --> 22:08.294
Yeah, I'm sure I was.

22:08.328 --> 22:11.397
Well, I'd imagine whoever it was
could see into the future,

22:11.431 --> 22:13.399
and knew what a nightmare
you'd turn into.

22:13.433 --> 22:16.035
(laughs)
Oh, ho, ho.

22:16.069 --> 22:17.436
(text alert tone sounds)

22:17.471 --> 22:19.338
Changed your tone.

22:20.474 --> 22:22.274
I like it.

22:23.343 --> 22:25.344
(door closing)

22:27.481 --> 22:29.382
(recording):
Please enter your password.

22:31.351 --> 22:33.285
You have one new message.

22:33.320 --> 22:34.353
(tone beeps)

22:34.388 --> 22:36.522
Hey, Emma, Travis here.

22:36.556 --> 22:39.425
Thought you'd want to know
you're in some serious trouble.

22:39.459 --> 22:41.193
Ma's pushing the assault charge.

22:41.228 --> 22:43.262
Cops took like a million
pictures of my face.

22:43.296 --> 22:45.164
Not smart running
the way you did.

22:45.198 --> 22:47.466
So where exactly are you?

23:10.793 --> 23:12.827
(door opens, closes)

23:14.864 --> 23:15.830
You okay?

23:15.865 --> 23:17.665
Yeah. I thought I just saw

23:17.700 --> 23:18.867
someone out there, but...

23:18.901 --> 23:21.903
I don't know, I
must've imagined it.

23:21.937 --> 23:24.973
I was kind of talking
in general. Sit.

23:25.007 --> 23:27.942
You've been
a little different

23:27.977 --> 23:29.744
since we got back.

23:29.778 --> 23:31.846
So people have
been telling me.

23:31.881 --> 23:33.982
Well, if it matters
or not, I like it.

23:34.016 --> 23:35.884
You do?

23:35.918 --> 23:37.919
Yeah.
It's nice to know

23:37.953 --> 23:40.822
we have each other
to rely on.

23:40.856 --> 23:43.725
How <i>Brady Bunch</i> was that?

23:43.759 --> 23:45.994
I loved that show.

23:47.062 --> 23:48.796
You hated it.

23:49.899 --> 23:53.001
Well, I'm a teenager.

23:53.035 --> 23:55.103
I'm allowed to change my mind.

23:55.137 --> 23:56.971
You know what I mean
though, right?

23:57.006 --> 23:58.706
A family is a great thing.

23:58.741 --> 24:00.074
Yeah.

24:00.109 --> 24:02.710
It's what I wanted
my whole life.

24:02.745 --> 24:04.746
It's what you've had
your whole life.

24:05.814 --> 24:07.048
Right.

24:09.051 --> 24:12.053
You know, when you were a kid,
it was right about now

24:12.087 --> 24:14.055
that you would ask for a hug.

24:15.991 --> 24:18.726
Am I too old now?

24:19.094 --> 24:20.895
Mmm.

24:29.772 --> 24:30.972
You go to bed soon, okay?

24:31.006 --> 24:32.907
You have a big day tomorrow.

24:34.810 --> 24:36.844
Good night.

24:40.749 --> 24:41.883
First day of school.

24:41.917 --> 24:43.084
And you're still asleep.

24:43.118 --> 24:45.053
Figured you'd
already be dressed.

24:45.087 --> 24:47.789
The whole school's going
to be dying to see

24:47.823 --> 24:48.823
what what Sutton Mercer
is wearing.

24:48.857 --> 24:51.025
Little curious, myself.

24:51.060 --> 24:52.894
Better hurry.

25:04.974 --> 25:08.977
You said this would be
fun, Sutton.

25:13.816 --> 25:15.984
It finally is.

25:26.962 --> 25:29.831
These are amazing.

25:29.865 --> 25:32.000
Last time I made you pancakes,
you refused to touch them.

25:32.034 --> 25:34.702
Pancakes--
strictly verboten

25:34.737 --> 25:37.805
on the Sutton lean, mean,
fighting machine diet.

25:37.840 --> 25:41.109
Oh. Well, I guess pancakes
are my new tofu.

25:52.121 --> 25:54.088
The miracle was getting you
to sit still long enough

25:54.123 --> 25:56.024
for that photo.

25:56.058 --> 25:58.760
I was a fussy baby.

25:58.794 --> 26:01.729
Very defiant.

26:01.764 --> 26:04.766
Did you guys want one kid
or two?

26:07.803 --> 26:09.003
I, uh... I don't...

26:09.038 --> 26:13.574
I just meant, was I supposed
to be an only child?

26:13.609 --> 26:16.744
Yes. We adopted you,
and then Laurel was a surprise.

26:16.779 --> 26:18.913
It was supposed
to be impossible.

26:18.947 --> 26:22.784
Just like that,
you had the complete family.

26:31.794 --> 26:32.960
Look...

26:45.941 --> 26:47.809
I mean, think about it--

26:47.843 --> 26:49.777
you could be living
just about anywhere.

26:49.812 --> 26:51.946
Yeah, I think
I did okay,

26:51.980 --> 26:54.982
considering
the alternative.

26:55.017 --> 26:57.785
I mean, if no one
adopted me.

26:57.820 --> 26:59.921
Really? Are there
still orphanages?

26:59.955 --> 27:01.656
I think some.

27:01.690 --> 27:03.024
I think it's mostly
foster families

27:03.058 --> 27:05.693
and I heard that those

27:05.728 --> 27:07.862
can get pretty awful.
(garbled radio transmission)

27:07.896 --> 27:09.964
Ah, yes, Scottsdale's own

27:09.998 --> 27:11.899
Ethan Whitehorse.

27:11.934 --> 27:14.035
Most likely guy in high school
to get into serious trouble,

27:14.069 --> 27:16.671
and most unlikely guy
to have a brother who's a cop.

27:16.705 --> 27:17.939
All right, later, sis.

27:17.973 --> 27:19.907
If I don't see you,
good luck against Nisha.

27:19.942 --> 27:21.008
Thanks.

27:23.746 --> 27:24.912
(indistinct chatter)

27:24.947 --> 27:26.047
GIRL:
Dude, you can't park there.

27:27.750 --> 27:30.952
BOY: We're going out
for lunch today, right?

27:30.986 --> 27:32.954
I can't, I have
detention.

27:32.988 --> 27:34.756
Oh, that's weak.

27:34.790 --> 27:35.857
Hey, Sutton.

27:35.891 --> 27:36.924
Hi.
Hey, Sutton.

27:36.959 --> 27:38.626
Love the shoes.
Yeah.

27:38.660 --> 27:39.961
Thanks.

27:39.995 --> 27:41.729
Hey, Sutton.
Hey, girl.

27:41.764 --> 27:42.797
Hey.
Hey, cute.

27:42.831 --> 27:44.732
Thanks.

27:44.767 --> 27:46.834
So, out of the blue, my mom
has, like, this "lurid" moment

27:46.869 --> 27:47.935
and starts going on about you.

27:47.970 --> 27:49.771
I think
you mean "lucid."

27:49.805 --> 27:51.038
Your mom was
talking about me?

27:51.073 --> 27:52.807
It was weird.

27:52.841 --> 27:54.008
I still can't get over
the fact they all went

27:54.042 --> 27:55.910
to high school together--
our parents.

27:55.944 --> 27:57.845
Too bad
they don't still get along.

27:57.880 --> 27:58.946
Not like us.

27:58.981 --> 28:00.047
Friends for life,
right, Sutton?

28:00.082 --> 28:02.650
For life.

28:02.684 --> 28:03.851
Babe.
Hmm?

28:03.886 --> 28:05.920
What, are we just going
to give up our table?

28:05.954 --> 28:08.689
No. No.

28:08.724 --> 28:10.892
(indistinct chatter)

28:13.695 --> 28:15.663
(sighs)

28:15.697 --> 28:17.632
GIRL: I think they got
back together.

28:18.901 --> 28:22.603
Am I nuts or are people
staring at us?

28:22.638 --> 28:24.705
Yeah, I guess.

28:27.709 --> 28:29.844
Everyone's wondering if
we're still a couple.

28:29.878 --> 28:31.712
How do you know that?

28:31.747 --> 28:33.748
Just stuff I heard.

28:33.782 --> 28:35.783
Oh.

28:36.919 --> 28:39.887
So are we still a couple?

28:39.922 --> 28:41.923
'Cause, I don't know,
sometimes I kind of think

28:41.957 --> 28:44.826
that you take
us for granted.

28:48.730 --> 28:51.799
Luke...

28:51.834 --> 28:53.868
I really appreciate you

28:53.902 --> 28:57.905
and... I appreciate this

28:57.940 --> 29:02.844
and I would be crazy
to take it for granted.

29:04.847 --> 29:06.848
You're looking at me
the way you used to.

29:06.882 --> 29:08.850
I...

29:08.884 --> 29:11.586
Come on.

29:12.588 --> 29:13.888
Follow me.

29:17.626 --> 29:20.628
Now, this, I didn't
want anyone to see.

29:34.576 --> 29:36.644
With everything that's
been going on, I just...

29:36.678 --> 29:37.912
I haven't been able

29:37.946 --> 29:41.549
to say what I wanted
to say for two days.

29:41.583 --> 29:44.552
I'm glad you're
back, Sutton.

29:44.586 --> 29:46.888
Thanks.

29:51.760 --> 29:53.728
It's really weird. I...

29:53.762 --> 29:57.765
I feel like there is something
you're not telling me.

30:01.803 --> 30:05.640
Actually, there's something
that you can tell me.

30:07.743 --> 30:10.912
How the hell am I going to
survive against Nisha today?

30:10.946 --> 30:12.613
(chuckles)

30:12.648 --> 30:16.550
Oh, well, uh...

30:16.585 --> 30:19.553
you've got a great
backhand, so use it,

30:19.588 --> 30:21.722
and, hey,
don't forget,

30:21.757 --> 30:22.890
you're better than
you think you are.

30:22.925 --> 30:25.693
(whistling, cheering,
and applause)

30:34.736 --> 30:37.838
(grunting)

30:37.873 --> 30:40.574
(both grunting)

31:03.432 --> 31:05.533
(cheering and applause)

31:05.567 --> 31:06.600
Yes.

31:22.751 --> 31:25.653
Okay, are you, like,
Humpty Dumpty or something?

31:25.687 --> 31:26.754
Because every time

31:26.788 --> 31:27.888
I see you, you're on a wall.

31:27.923 --> 31:29.623
And you know what?
If Luke knew

31:29.658 --> 31:30.858
that you were
stalking me,

31:30.892 --> 31:32.626
he'd be really pissed.

31:32.661 --> 31:35.496
Stalking you?
What else would you call it?

31:35.530 --> 31:37.732
(scoffs) I guess just
about anything else.

31:39.634 --> 31:41.602
Hey, that was you

31:41.636 --> 31:43.637
last night outside my window,
wasn't it?

31:46.608 --> 31:48.609
Of course it was.

32:01.623 --> 32:03.791
Hey, where's your gym bag?
Huh?

32:03.825 --> 32:05.659
Probably left it
on the courts.

32:05.694 --> 32:07.628
(sighs) That was like
every day last year.

32:30.941 --> 32:33.820
That's horrible--
actually kissing.

32:34.010 --> 32:38.141
And I know that you like Luke,
and I do too.

32:38.142 --> 32:40.043
It's just...

32:40.077 --> 32:42.846
do I confront him?
Well, yeah.

32:42.880 --> 32:44.747
I mean, you can't let
someone do that to you,

32:44.782 --> 32:46.082
and the alternative would be

32:46.117 --> 32:48.151
to pretend
you didn't see anything.

32:48.185 --> 32:49.953
It's...
Right.

32:49.987 --> 32:51.855
And leaving something
out isn't a lie.

32:51.889 --> 32:54.157
Some people say that.

32:54.191 --> 32:57.127
I think a lie's a lie,

32:57.161 --> 32:59.829
but if the reasons
are reasonable,

32:59.864 --> 33:03.666
then maybe you can
forgive the lie.

33:08.873 --> 33:12.775
Your father and I
love you so much, Sutton.

33:12.810 --> 33:13.977
We chose you.

33:14.011 --> 33:16.946
We would do
anything for you.

33:16.981 --> 33:19.916
And... I think...

33:19.950 --> 33:21.851
I think that's all that matters.

33:21.886 --> 33:24.053
It is.

33:24.088 --> 33:26.856
It is.

33:27.925 --> 33:30.894
And I know I haven't

33:30.928 --> 33:33.129
really appreciated all
that you guys have done.

33:33.164 --> 33:34.998
You and Dad.

33:35.032 --> 33:38.034
But I just need you to know
that no matter what happens,

33:38.068 --> 33:40.103
I love you.

33:40.137 --> 33:42.071
I love you both, and...

33:42.106 --> 33:45.942
I'm sorry for the way
that I've... been.

33:45.976 --> 33:48.077
Or...

33:48.112 --> 33:50.079
the way that I think
I was this summer.

33:50.114 --> 33:53.082
I'm so sorry, too.

34:00.057 --> 34:01.891
What's the point?

34:01.926 --> 34:05.028
10:00 p.m.
it's all over.

34:05.062 --> 34:07.797
What happens
at 10:00 p.m.

34:07.831 --> 34:09.799
Is this a Cinderella thing?

34:09.833 --> 34:12.034
I should just tell you.

34:12.069 --> 34:13.036
Tell me what?

34:13.070 --> 34:15.038
(footsteps approach)

34:15.072 --> 34:16.873
You're not dressed.

34:16.907 --> 34:19.742
Don't say you're not going.
All of Arroyo High knows

34:19.777 --> 34:21.811
you kicked Nisha's ass, and
they want to see the fireworks.

34:21.844 --> 34:23.880
Sounds like she's got
someplace else to be.

34:23.914 --> 34:25.081
CHAR:
What is wrong with you guys?

34:25.114 --> 34:26.949
So what if it's Nisha-Lucretia,

34:26.984 --> 34:28.985
it's still a party.

34:29.018 --> 34:30.920
With seniors,
glorious seniors.

34:30.955 --> 34:33.922
You guys are amazing,
you know that. Right?

34:33.958 --> 34:35.725
You're really scaring me,
Sutton.

34:35.759 --> 34:37.960
Now, get dressed so we can go.

34:37.995 --> 34:39.829
Why don't you go pick something
out of my closet?

34:39.862 --> 34:40.964
You know it better than I do.

34:44.802 --> 34:46.969
(people talking, laughing)

34:48.806 --> 34:50.940
(indistinct conversations)

34:52.943 --> 34:55.078
GIRL:
Char!

34:55.112 --> 34:56.913
Hey!

34:56.947 --> 34:59.115
(overlapping greetings, talking)

35:01.018 --> 35:03.052
Thought we were coming
together to this.

35:03.087 --> 35:05.755
Came with my friends.

35:06.757 --> 35:08.791
Okay. You want to explain this?

35:09.093 --> 35:10.827
What?

35:10.861 --> 35:12.095
This. The cold shoulder.

35:13.097 --> 35:15.064
Sorry, Luke.

35:15.099 --> 35:18.768
Guess I'm just having a little
trouble trusting you right now.

35:23.941 --> 35:24.974
LUKE:
<i>Hey, hey,</i>

35:25.009 --> 35:26.776
babe, babe.
Just come here.

35:26.810 --> 35:28.845
Stop.

35:28.879 --> 35:29.946
I saw you with Nisha.

35:29.980 --> 35:32.081
Okay?
At the tennis courts?

35:32.116 --> 35:33.916
So how long has that been
going on? All summer?

35:33.951 --> 35:35.752
Or just since I've been back?
Sutton...

35:35.786 --> 35:36.886
I'm going to vote "all summer."

35:36.920 --> 35:38.121
Sutton, you were avoiding me.

35:38.155 --> 35:39.822
You were, you were distracted.

35:39.857 --> 35:41.090
So what was that today?

35:41.125 --> 35:43.826
Your lips just accidentally
ran into Nisha's?

35:43.861 --> 35:45.094
Baby, she kissed me.

35:45.129 --> 35:47.096
And I-I told her it was over,
and it was a summer thing,

35:47.131 --> 35:48.765
and that you and I
had talked.

35:48.799 --> 35:50.767
Remember?
The auditorium?

35:50.801 --> 35:52.835
He doesn't give
a crap about you.

35:52.870 --> 35:54.771
You won nothing today.

35:54.805 --> 35:56.072
You got lucky.

35:56.106 --> 35:58.074
You have never been in my
league, and you never will be.

35:58.108 --> 36:00.743
Oh, you know what, Nisha?

36:00.778 --> 36:02.979
I have known people
like you my entire life.

36:03.013 --> 36:05.748
In fact, I have actually wanted
to be like you at one point,

36:05.783 --> 36:06.849
but all you do

36:06.884 --> 36:08.885
is put people down,
and somehow

36:08.919 --> 36:11.788
you think that makes you
better than anybody else.

36:11.822 --> 36:13.923
At least it doesn't
make me a poser.

36:13.957 --> 36:14.924
<i>What?</i>

36:14.958 --> 36:16.092
Truth is...

36:16.126 --> 36:18.027
you were abandoned,

36:18.062 --> 36:19.996
Sutton.

36:20.030 --> 36:21.931
Even your real mother
didn't want you.

36:21.965 --> 36:23.700
(kids exclaiming)

36:23.734 --> 36:24.767
NISHA:
Get her out of here!

36:24.802 --> 36:25.935
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Now!

36:25.969 --> 36:27.870
NISHA: Or I swear to God
I call the cops!

36:27.905 --> 36:30.873
That was beautiful.

36:30.908 --> 36:32.709
Where you going?
I'll come with.

36:32.743 --> 36:34.777
I'm good.
I'm just going to go home.

36:34.812 --> 36:36.979
Good night.

36:37.848 --> 36:39.849
Mads...

36:42.052 --> 36:44.120
See you later.

36:44.154 --> 36:45.988
Sure.

36:54.965 --> 36:56.766
I'm really tired
of this game.

36:56.800 --> 36:58.801
No! Get out of my car. Get out.
I didn't even know you were here.

36:58.836 --> 37:00.903
Yeah, you didn't look.
Humpty was on the wall.

37:12.916 --> 37:15.051
I knew it.

37:15.085 --> 37:16.719
You're not Sutton.

37:19.342 --> 37:21.389
I'm right, aren't I?
You're not Sutton.

37:21.390 --> 37:22.490
You're someone else.
You're a pain in my ass.

37:22.524 --> 37:23.591
See, Sutton would
never say that.

37:23.625 --> 37:25.459
Shut up.
Or that.

37:25.494 --> 37:26.594
Go away.
Or that!

37:27.663 --> 37:28.663
I am Sutton.

37:28.697 --> 37:30.564
S-U-T-T...

37:30.599 --> 37:33.742
(sighs)
Just forget it. Forget it.

37:33.743 --> 37:35.454
All right. If you're
Sutton, fine. Prove it.

37:35.738 --> 37:37.368
Prove you're Sutton.
Answer me one question.

37:37.372 --> 37:40.474
Who's your boyfriend?
Luke Coburn is my boyfriend.

37:40.509 --> 37:41.575
Or at least was.

37:41.610 --> 37:43.511
Or never was.

37:44.646 --> 37:46.347
I'm Sutton's boyfriend.

37:46.381 --> 37:48.416
Sutton and I
have been seeing each other

37:48.450 --> 37:49.650
for nearly a year.

37:49.685 --> 37:53.387
We texted the entire time
she was in Paris

37:53.422 --> 37:54.588
and Skyped and talked.

37:54.623 --> 37:56.424
You know,
I had a feeling

37:56.458 --> 37:57.658
about you
first time I saw you.

37:57.693 --> 37:59.627
Then on the court
with Nisha,

37:59.661 --> 38:01.696
then you accuse me
of being a stalker,

38:01.730 --> 38:04.498
and that kiss just now--
you might look like her...

38:04.533 --> 38:07.635
you don't kiss like her.

38:07.669 --> 38:09.637
You done?

38:09.671 --> 38:11.472
Soon as you tell me
where the real Sutton is.

38:11.506 --> 38:12.640
You're looking at her,

38:12.674 --> 38:14.675
and now you're looking
at her walking away.

38:19.548 --> 38:21.582
(engine starts)

38:21.616 --> 38:23.617
(car drives away)

38:51.747 --> 38:53.748
(door creaks)

39:00.455 --> 39:02.456
Sutton?

39:12.601 --> 39:14.568
Sutton.

39:19.641 --> 39:21.642
Sutton?

39:47.502 --> 39:49.470
(rattling)

39:49.504 --> 39:51.505
Sutton.

39:59.514 --> 40:02.516
So you ready to tell me who
you are, where you've come from,

40:02.551 --> 40:03.617
and what the hell you've done

40:03.652 --> 40:05.653
with Sutton?

40:07.589 --> 40:10.357
All right, I can go
to Sutton's parents

40:10.392 --> 40:12.393
if that's what
you want,

40:12.427 --> 40:14.235
or my brother, the cop.

40:14.529 --> 40:19.785
All right... I'm not Sutton.

40:22.599 --> 40:25.635
I am her twin sister Emma.

40:25.669 --> 40:28.337
My name is Emma Becker.

40:28.372 --> 40:30.339
Oh, God,

40:30.374 --> 40:32.341
you have no idea
how many times

40:32.376 --> 40:35.511
I have wanted to say that
in the last two days.

40:35.546 --> 40:38.548
We switched places
when I got here.

40:38.582 --> 40:39.649
(laughs)

40:39.683 --> 40:43.386
Man, two whole days.

40:43.420 --> 40:44.587
You fooled
everyone.

40:44.621 --> 40:46.389
Except you.

40:46.423 --> 40:48.658
All it took was a kiss.

40:48.692 --> 40:50.660
<i>So you're running</i>

40:50.694 --> 40:52.595
from the law
in Nevada.

40:52.629 --> 40:57.333
That explains why you're
here, but the switch...

40:57.367 --> 40:58.601
Sutton didn't want
me to tell anybody,

40:58.635 --> 41:00.603
especially her family.

41:00.637 --> 41:02.284
This has to do with her search for
her real parents, doesn't it?

41:02.309 --> 41:03.473
She told you?

41:03.474 --> 41:04.662
I know she's been
looking into it,

41:04.663 --> 41:06.631
and I'm guessing,
except for you,

41:06.665 --> 41:08.566
I am the only other
person who knows.

41:10.869 --> 41:14.539
So, what's it like being Sutton?

41:14.573 --> 41:16.641
Well, let's see.

41:16.675 --> 41:18.876
I broke up
with her fake boyfriend,

41:18.911 --> 41:20.645
I accused her real boyfriend

41:20.679 --> 41:22.613
of being a stalker.

41:22.648 --> 41:25.850
With her parents, I tried
to help, except that backfired,

41:25.884 --> 41:27.752
and... well, at least
with her sister,

41:27.786 --> 41:30.488
I think I managed
to actually fix something.

41:30.522 --> 41:31.689
She said her whole life
is on her computer,

41:31.724 --> 41:34.525
and I went through
that thing over and over again.

41:34.560 --> 41:36.527
Guess she had a lot of secrets.

41:36.562 --> 41:38.663
She said
that she'd be here at 10:00.

41:38.697 --> 41:40.765
I don't know why she wouldn't
call if she got delayed

41:40.799 --> 41:45.703
or e-mail or text or--
I have her phone-- I had it.

41:45.738 --> 41:46.804
Sutton was always

41:46.839 --> 41:48.639
losing it, too.

41:49.875 --> 41:52.810
This switch was
really important to her.

41:52.845 --> 41:54.879
That's why I've done everything
that I can to make it work.

41:54.913 --> 41:56.814
Then you have to keep it up.

41:58.584 --> 42:00.518
We both do.

42:00.552 --> 42:01.786
So I go on
being Sutton.

42:01.820 --> 42:03.821
Until she
comes back.

42:05.758 --> 42:08.526
I got home first, and
the alarm was going off.

42:08.560 --> 42:10.828
TED: Alarm company said
it went off at exactly 10:15.

42:10.863 --> 42:12.530
What's going on?

42:12.564 --> 42:14.665
Oh, thank God.
Where were you?

42:14.700 --> 42:15.733
I went for a walk

42:15.768 --> 42:17.902
and I left my
phone in my car.

42:17.936 --> 42:19.570
Someone broke into the house,
into your room.

42:19.605 --> 42:22.607
We think maybe
Laurel scared them away.

42:22.641 --> 42:25.510
We need to take a look around,
see if anything's missing.

42:33.719 --> 42:35.720
(sighs)

42:46.665 --> 42:48.666
The laptop's gone.

42:49.835 --> 42:51.803
Is that it?

42:52.838 --> 42:55.573
Looks like it.

42:55.607 --> 42:56.641
Also, according

42:56.675 --> 42:59.577
to Madeline Rybak,

42:59.611 --> 43:02.513
you left
the party early.

43:02.548 --> 43:04.849
Where were you, Sutton?

43:06.650 --> 43:07.656
KRISTIN: I don't care
where you were.

43:07.657 --> 43:11.627
As long as you're safe,
it's all that matters to me.

43:11.661 --> 43:13.562
God,

43:13.597 --> 43:16.632
what would I ever do
without my Sutton?

(RADIO ANNOUNCER)
Cool night here in L.A.

43:27.476 --> 43:29.310
This is
for all the lonely people.

43:29.345 --> 43:30.578
(car door opens and closes)

43:30.613 --> 43:32.313
(gasps)
