that you discharged a deadly weapon

15:23.714 --> 15:27.760
- I thought the punk was gone forever.
- Evidently somebody found him.

15:27.844 --> 15:31.472
- Somebody messing with us?
- This you're not gonna believe.

15:35.309 --> 15:36.602
What is it?

15:41.607 --> 15:44.193
Tattoo looks fresh. Hold that.

15:45.486 --> 15:48.030
I guess being a diabetic,
you don't mind needles.

15:48.322 --> 15:50.074
I'm Michael, by the way.

15:50.158 --> 15:52.452
Scofield. I read your report.

15:52.535 --> 15:55.496
- And you are?
- Dr. Tancredi will do.

15:55.913 --> 15:57.498
Tancredi like the Governor?

15:59.542 --> 16:01.335
You're not related, are you?

16:03.838 --> 16:06.549
Wouldn't think you'd find the daughter
of "Frontier Justice" Frank

16:06.632 --> 16:08.092
working in a prison.

16:08.468 --> 16:10.219
As a doctor no less.

16:10.470 --> 16:13.556
I believe in being part of the solution,
not the problem.

16:15.349 --> 16:17.727
"Be the change
you want to see in the world."

16:21.564 --> 16:22.648
What?

16:24.275 --> 16:26.569
Nothing. That was just my senior quote.

16:26.694 --> 16:29.739
That was you? This whole time
I was thinking it was Gandhi.

16:30.740 --> 16:32.074
You're very funny.

16:32.658 --> 16:36.078
Sit tight. Put direct pressure on that.
I'll be back in a sec.

16:50.760 --> 16:54.013
So, how do we play this? You hook me up
with a few weeks' supply?

16:54.096 --> 16:56.432
Nice try. No hypos on the floor.

16:57.058 --> 16:59.769
I'm the farthest thing from a junkie.
Trust me.

16:59.936 --> 17:01.062
I got news for you, Michael.

17:01.145 --> 17:03.898
"Trust me" means absolutely zero
inside these walls.

17:03.981 --> 17:07.609
The only way you're getting that insulin
is if I'm administering it.

17:07.693 --> 17:10.404
I guess we'll be seeing
a lot of each other then.

17:10.488 --> 17:11.614
I guess so.

17:24.752 --> 17:27.128
- We're all clear on the Burrows execution.
- Good.

17:27.213 --> 17:30.800
Except for one thing.
Bishop McMorrow is not in the fold.

17:33.636 --> 17:35.972
He's got a lot of influence
with the Governor.

17:36.180 --> 17:38.391
They went to prep school
together apparently.

17:39.225 --> 17:41.102
Look, the closer it gets,

17:41.394 --> 17:44.981
the more I'm worried that the bottom
is gonna fall out of this whole thing.

17:49.193 --> 17:52.655
Maybe it's time you arranged a visit
with the good bishop then.

17:53.823 --> 17:57.034
Look, in one month it'll all be over.

17:58.202 --> 18:02.498
"The Son of man must be delivered
into the hands of sinful men,

18:02.582 --> 18:06.168
"and be crucified,
and the third day rise again."

18:06.669 --> 18:09.839
"And they remembered his words,"
and so should you.

18:10.423 --> 18:13.175
Good day, gentlemen.
May God be with you.

18:18.139 --> 18:20.349
OFFICER 1: Okay, let's go, let's go, let's go.

18:25.146 --> 18:26.355
Michael?

18:28.691 --> 18:30.192
OFFICER 2: Let's go. Come on, man.

18:32.695 --> 18:36.073
- Why?
- I'm getting you out of here.

18:36.449 --> 18:39.160
Burrows, roll it up. Happy hour's over.

18:39.702 --> 18:43.372
- It's impossible.
- Not if you designed the place, it isn't.

18:51.797 --> 18:53.049
VERONICA: Too formal.

18:55.718 --> 18:57.053
Too greeting card.

18:57.553 --> 19:00.431
Well, we got to make a decision
sooner or later, you know.

19:00.514 --> 19:03.976
- We have time.
- We don't, actually.

19:04.852 --> 19:08.105
I mean, at some point,
we got to pull the trigger on this thing.

19:08.189 --> 19:09.857
I don't want to rush this.

19:09.940 --> 19:12.610
We're only gonna do it once.
We have to get it right.

19:17.782 --> 19:21.410
- Honey, can I ask you something?
- Of course.

19:22.578 --> 19:25.414
- Are you putting this off?
- What do you mean?

19:25.498 --> 19:28.584
- I mean, are you having second thoughts?
- No.

19:29.418 --> 19:31.796
Honey, no. I'm not.

19:32.755 --> 19:35.591
I don't know, but I just
can't help thinking this is about...

19:35.675 --> 19:36.801
It's not.

19:38.260 --> 19:39.470
I love you,

19:40.346 --> 19:42.139
and I want to be your wife.

19:46.435 --> 19:49.814
-"Passion"? What were you thinking?
- Hey, you went for it.

19:49.897 --> 19:53.234
She probably thinks
I went sissy up in here. "Passion."

19:53.317 --> 19:56.362
You know, got more than one syllable,
too much talking.

19:56.445 --> 19:58.656
That's me from now on.
"One Syllable Sucre".

19:58.739 --> 19:59.949
Yes. No.

20:00.116 --> 20:01.534
Love. Hate.

20:01.909 --> 20:03.619
- Love.
- Give it time.

20:03.703 --> 20:06.539
Are you kidding? I proposed to her.

20:06.706 --> 20:10.418
That doesn't take time. Si or no.
One syllable, man.

20:13.087 --> 20:16.006
She's supposed to come around
for a conjugal on Tuesday.

20:16.090 --> 20:19.385
She's always calling me beforehand,
letting me know she's coming.

20:19.468 --> 20:22.054
This time, man, I ain't heard a peep.

20:23.222 --> 20:24.640
You spooked her.

20:25.599 --> 20:28.811
Scofield, get it together.
Pope wants to see you.

20:32.898 --> 20:34.358
No good, Fish.

20:34.817 --> 20:36.944
No one gets an audience with the Pope.

20:37.027 --> 20:40.030
Not unless he's real interested
in what you got going on.

20:41.073 --> 20:44.827
<i>POPE: Top of your class at Loyola.
Magna cum laude, in fact.</i>

20:46.328 --> 20:49.039
I can't help wondering
what someone with your credentials

20:49.123 --> 20:50.916
is doing in a place like this.

20:52.251 --> 20:54.628
Took a wrong turn
a few months back, I guess.

20:55.045 --> 20:57.173
You make it sound like a traffic infraction.

20:57.256 --> 21:00.050
Like all you did was turn the wrong way
up a one-way street.

21:00.134 --> 21:02.219
Everyone turns up one sooner or later.

21:05.681 --> 21:07.475
The reason I called you here,

21:08.517 --> 21:13.272
I noticed in your I-file, under occupation,
you put down unemployed.

21:14.231 --> 21:15.816
That's not true now, is it?

21:18.944 --> 21:21.864
I know you're
a structural engineer, Scofield.

21:25.284 --> 21:28.204
Shah Jahan built the Taj Mahal

21:28.287 --> 21:30.998
as a monument
to his undying love for his wife.

21:31.707 --> 21:33.834
My wife is quite fond of the story.

21:34.376 --> 21:36.796
It appeals to the romantic in her.

21:38.756 --> 21:42.343
Being married to someone in Corrections,
terrible job.

21:42.426 --> 21:44.512
Wouldn't wish it on anyone.

21:44.595 --> 21:49.016
And yet, in 39 years,
my wife has never complained.

21:49.600 --> 21:52.728
And the worst part of it is,
I've never thanked her.

21:54.396 --> 21:58.901
So, because I couldn't say it,
I thought, you know, I could build it.

22:00.611 --> 22:03.405
Come June, it's our 40th anniversary.

22:05.533 --> 22:07.076
But, here, look.

22:07.409 --> 22:10.412
You see, the problem is, I build any more,

22:11.080 --> 22:14.083
it's all gonna come down
like a house of cards.

22:14.166 --> 22:17.294
That's where I was hoping
you could be of assistance.

22:17.378 --> 22:21.215
And for the favor, I can offer you
three days of work a week in here,

22:21.298 --> 22:23.384
and it'll keep you off the yard.

22:30.474 --> 22:31.725
I can't do it.

22:33.811 --> 22:37.147
Son, it's better for me
to owe you one in here

22:37.231 --> 22:40.651
than it is for you to owe me one,
I can promise you that.

22:40.734 --> 22:42.528
I'll take my chances.

22:45.406 --> 22:47.408
Then we're through here.

22:47.908 --> 22:48.951
Guard!

22:51.912 --> 22:53.539
Two pounds of pot?

22:54.456 --> 22:56.709
What were you trying to do, set a record?

22:56.792 --> 22:59.795
It's not funny, LJ.
You could be going to jail.

23:01.463 --> 23:04.633
It's pretty obvious to me
you need some guidance.

23:07.928 --> 23:09.013
Thanks.

23:11.348 --> 23:12.933
From who? Old Daddy Warbucks?

23:13.017 --> 23:16.729
- Give him a chance. He's a good man.
- We got nothing in common.

23:16.812 --> 23:19.064
Oh, where's this coming from, LJ?

23:19.148 --> 23:22.359
Last semester, you were getting
almost all A's and now...

23:25.571 --> 23:28.407
- It's your father, isn't it?
- I don't have a father.

23:28.490 --> 23:31.785
It wasn't an immaculate conception,
honey, trust me.

23:34.663 --> 23:36.832
Maybe it's time we went and saw him.

23:37.917 --> 23:39.001
Mom.

23:39.209 --> 23:40.294
Ma.

23:40.628 --> 23:41.670
Don't.

23:41.754 --> 23:45.215
I'm about as excited by the prospect
as you are, but something's got to give.

23:45.299 --> 23:49.053
You have got too much potential
to be screwing up your life like this.

23:52.890 --> 23:55.976
What if they'd sent you
to Taylorville or Marion and not here?

23:56.977 --> 23:59.229
I think I'd be doing the same thing
I'm doing in here.

23:59.313 --> 24:01.523
Eating Jell-O, drinking Kool-Aid.

24:01.607 --> 24:03.400
I know what you're doing.

24:03.484 --> 24:06.987
It's not the luck of the draw
that you're in here with Lincoln.

24:07.071 --> 24:09.365
You forget I know you, both of you.

24:09.490 --> 24:13.243
You two have the most dysfunctional idea
of love I've ever seen.

24:13.327 --> 24:15.746
What, he beats you up
to keep you off the streets,

24:15.829 --> 24:18.582
so you get yourself
tossed into Fox River with him?

24:18.666 --> 24:20.834
To what? Save him?

24:23.420 --> 24:26.298
I deserve to know.
I loved him as much as you did.

24:26.382 --> 24:29.009
Past tense for you, maybe. Not me.

24:29.885 --> 24:32.721
I gave him a shot
when I got back from college. I did.

24:32.805 --> 24:34.807
Even with all the stuff
that was going on with him,

24:34.890 --> 24:37.726
I did everything I could to make it work
and he threw it away.

24:37.810 --> 24:41.689
You ever think maybe he was hurt
that you left in the first place?

24:41.772 --> 24:43.107
Don't do this.

24:43.190 --> 24:45.776
Whatever it is you're doing, don't do it.
There's a better way.

24:45.859 --> 24:47.236
I'm already appealing your case.

24:47.319 --> 24:48.445
I told you to leave that alone.

24:48.529 --> 24:50.572
I've gotten in touch with the diocese
about Lincoln.

24:50.656 --> 24:54.660
- The bishop may be able to help.
- That won't stop it. It'll only delay it.

24:58.205 --> 25:02.126
You want to do something?
You find out who's trying to bury him.

25:04.586 --> 25:06.714
Nobody's trying to bury him.

25:06.797 --> 25:09.925
- The evidence was there.
- The evidence was cooked.

25:12.720 --> 25:14.888
GUARD: Visiting hours are now over.

25:15.472 --> 25:16.974
(BELL RINGING)

25:20.144 --> 25:21.812
Take care of yourself.

25:23.647 --> 25:27.818
Someone wants him dead, Veronica.
Something more is going on here.

25:28.736 --> 25:31.405
This is desperation, Michael.
You're grabbing at straws.

25:31.488 --> 25:34.825
- You're in denial.
- Maybe. But I can't watch him die.

25:34.950 --> 25:36.326
I won't do that.

26:06.106 --> 26:07.149
Gentlemen.

26:07.232 --> 26:10.819
What is it about the Burrows situation
that I can help you with?

26:10.903 --> 26:14.823
It's our understanding that you
have great influence with the Governor.

26:14.907 --> 26:18.994
I wouldn't say it's great or influence.
We're friends.

26:19.078 --> 26:22.498
It's also our understanding
that you oppose the death penalty.

26:22.581 --> 26:24.500
I'm a man of God. How could I not?

26:24.583 --> 26:27.503
In this case, we're hoping
you'll suspend that position.

26:27.586 --> 26:29.254
At least temporarily.

26:29.546 --> 26:32.841
If the inmate appeals to me
for intervention,

26:33.342 --> 26:35.010
how can I turn my back on him?

26:35.094 --> 26:38.013
You have a habit
of answering a question with a question.

26:38.097 --> 26:41.517
And you have a way of asking questions
that beg more questions.

26:46.146 --> 26:49.983
- Are you saying you won't do it?
- I'm not a man to equivocate.

26:53.237 --> 26:56.073
You're what, 62 years old now,
Your Excellency.

26:56.156 --> 26:57.199
That's right.

26:57.282 --> 26:58.909
I would assume then
that you'd be well-versed

26:58.992 --> 27:00.828
in how our government's
tax system works.

27:00.911 --> 27:04.373
Taking personal capital gains
under the church's tax shelter...

27:04.915 --> 27:07.501
That'd be fraud, wouldn't it,
Your Excellency?

27:08.210 --> 27:11.880
I will not be cowed
into forsaking my beliefs.

27:12.422 --> 27:14.716
Not by you or anyone else.

27:15.592 --> 27:16.885
Admirable.

27:17.886 --> 27:19.513
Good day, Your Excellency.

27:20.222 --> 27:21.723
Mr. Kellerman.

27:23.183 --> 27:27.229
What is it about this case
that the Secret Service is so interested in?

27:27.312 --> 27:29.773
The man killed
the Vice President's brother.

27:37.489 --> 27:39.241
- What did you say?
- You <i>heard</i> me.

27:39.575 --> 27:42.953
Someone found Fibonacci.
I'm looking at the photos right now.

27:43.287 --> 27:47.499
<i>Son of a bitch has got a beard, sunglasses,
Witness Protection if I ever saw it.</i>

27:47.916 --> 27:49.376
Who was this someone?

27:49.459 --> 27:52.254
I don't know.
There's no return address on the envelope.

27:52.337 --> 27:57.050
Just...this folded-up bird made of paper.

27:59.469 --> 28:02.097
- Like origami?
- Yeah, like that.

28:02.764 --> 28:04.141
<i>Like origami.</i>

28:38.550 --> 28:40.552
You're Charles Westmoreland, right?

28:40.636 --> 28:43.847
- Do I know you?
- Knew your wife before she passed.

28:44.306 --> 28:46.516
- You knew Marla?
- You mean Ann?

28:47.476 --> 28:50.687
- How'd you know her?
- We taught together in Boston.

28:50.812 --> 28:53.690
- East Farmington.
- You mean West Wilmington?

28:54.483 --> 28:57.194
No more tests, I promise.

28:58.820 --> 29:01.031
Seems you know everything about me.

29:01.114 --> 29:03.283
- Who are you?
- Michael Scofield.

29:03.742 --> 29:07.371
- How'd you get it in here?
- First off, she's not an it.

29:07.913 --> 29:10.415
She's Marilyn, and she's grandfathered

29:10.499 --> 29:12.751
back from the days
when prisoners were allowed

29:12.834 --> 29:15.212
a creature comfort or two.

29:15.295 --> 29:17.339
Heard you were D.B. Cooper.

29:18.674 --> 29:21.843
Every new fish comes in here,
first thing they hear

29:21.927 --> 29:24.513
is that Charles Westmoreland's
D.B. Cooper.

29:24.888 --> 29:27.057
I'll tell you like I tell them.

29:28.100 --> 29:29.977
You want the Cooper story?

29:30.060 --> 29:32.854
I can't give it to you 'cause I'm not him.

29:33.146 --> 29:35.941
That's too bad. Sort of wish it was true.

29:36.149 --> 29:37.567
Man's a legend.

29:37.651 --> 29:40.529
Nowhere near as much
as I wish it were true, friend.

29:40.612 --> 29:43.365
I'd have $1.5 million waiting for me
on the outside.

29:46.535 --> 29:49.079
I'd put some grass under them
if I were you.

29:50.247 --> 29:53.625
This thing would go a whole lot easier
if you'd just hire me.

29:53.709 --> 29:55.502
What is this all about?

29:56.378 --> 29:59.214
Say you were able
to get outside those walls.

29:59.298 --> 30:02.384
Would you have the people in place
to make sure you disappeared forever?

30:02.467 --> 30:05.220
- What do you care?
- Just curious.

30:05.345 --> 30:08.515
- Where's Fibonacci?
- That's not the way it works.

I'm coming after you.

30:53.560 --> 30:55.103
Get on the ground!

30:56.772 --> 31:01.401
I totally misjudged you, Scofield.
I didn't think you were the agitating type.

31:01.485 --> 31:04.196
Behavior like that
will not be tolerated in my prison.

31:04.279 --> 31:05.572
Ninety days in the SHU.

31:05.655 --> 31:07.908
That ought to be enough time
to convince you of that fact.

31:07.991 --> 31:09.618
- Ninety days?
- That's right.

31:17.709 --> 31:19.711
Something you want to say?

31:20.045 --> 31:21.463
It's just...

31:22.130 --> 31:24.257
I'm not of much value to you in the SHU.

31:24.341 --> 31:26.802
- Value?
- The Taj.

31:27.427 --> 31:29.805
It'd be a shame for the eighth wonder
of the modern world

31:29.888 --> 31:32.682
to collapse because the stress
isn't properly propagated.

31:32.766 --> 31:35.477
- Properly propagated?
- Properly propagated.

31:35.560 --> 31:37.437
The joints are overloaded.

31:37.521 --> 31:39.773
They won't provide anywhere near
the sheer strength

How much work are we talking?

31:45.028 --> 31:47.322
- You want it by when, June?
- Yes.

wouldn't you say?

Someone shot him while he was sleeping.

32:41.835 --> 32:45.005
- I thought you'd want to know.
- Thanks.

32:52.429 --> 32:54.055
Michael was right.

33:23.502 --> 33:25.462
Sink, you got a visitor.

33:38.016 --> 33:39.559
He was arrested.

33:41.228 --> 33:43.730
- For what?
- Possession of marijuana.

33:47.108 --> 33:50.028
I figured he could use
some fatherly advice before it's...

33:51.655 --> 33:53.657
- Gone forever?
- I didn't mean that.

33:53.740 --> 33:56.243
I know you didn't. Thanks, Lisa.

DOpe, huh?

34:05.961 --> 34:07.295
Using or dealing?

34:08.755 --> 34:10.297
What's the difference?

34:10.382 --> 34:13.760
Then what? You think it gives you
some kind of street cred?

34:15.469 --> 34:18.223
You got a piece of the good life.
Take advantage.

34:19.139 --> 34:21.643
Look, I get it, the whole thing.

You got to realize who's getting punished
when you're doing the things you're doing.

34:39.244 --> 34:42.246
You think it's me. It's you.
I did the same thing.

Punished the old man 'cause he was gone.
Look what it got me.

34:49.254 --> 34:51.797
I'm not asking you to love me.

You can still put the brakes on this thing.

So, that's what fatherly advice is like.

Where are you going?

35:06.855 --> 35:08.356
I got homework.
