00:06.506 --> 00:10.635
A NETFLIX SERIES

00:22.230 --> 00:23.314
Mezcal, please.

00:36.745 --> 00:37.620
Honey!

00:38.955 --> 00:40.040
I found a job!

00:57.015 --> 00:58.433
She's hot, right?

01:00.602 --> 01:01.686
What's her name?

01:02.479 --> 01:03.396
Matilde.

01:03.480 --> 01:06.149
She's on Instagram.
Drop-dead gorgeous, right?

01:07.984 --> 01:08.985
This is her mom.

01:10.403 --> 01:11.821
She's a total mystery.

01:13.364 --> 01:15.533
They say she lives in Mexico City.

01:17.202 --> 01:18.536
But no one's heard from her.

01:20.330 --> 01:21.331
It was you, right?

01:22.832 --> 01:24.209
You wrote to me, bitch.

01:25.835 --> 01:27.212
I don't know what you mean.

02:21.224 --> 02:22.684
Hey. Where are you going?

02:23.226 --> 02:27.397
-I need to speak with her.
-Leave her alone, Simón.

02:27.480 --> 02:28.815
Do I know you?

02:38.700 --> 02:40.285
Are you leaving me?

02:42.370 --> 02:44.622
You promised you'd never take it off.

02:48.293 --> 02:49.335
Stop!

02:49.878 --> 02:53.673
You need to understand that I own the bar,

02:53.756 --> 02:55.383
so I decide who's welcome.

02:55.466 --> 02:58.303
-This is your bar?
-I said get out!

02:59.762 --> 03:02.098
Come to the office, Daniel.

03:04.309 --> 03:05.268
Walk.

03:09.230 --> 03:10.148
Walk!

03:10.231 --> 03:11.357
Get off of her!

03:16.779 --> 03:18.406
Pocho, you're going to kill him!

03:18.489 --> 03:20.450
Stop, Pocho!

03:20.533 --> 03:21.784
Call the cops.

03:40.345 --> 03:42.347
Hi. Good evening, Grace.

03:44.891 --> 03:45.934
Hi.

03:46.601 --> 03:47.435
Is Simón here?

03:48.478 --> 03:50.563
He won't take my calls.

03:51.898 --> 03:56.027
We need to talk about
one of the foundation's files.

03:56.861 --> 03:58.154
Simón isn't back yet.

03:58.863 --> 04:01.157
I think it's important. Do you mind if…

04:01.241 --> 04:02.075
Would you…

04:05.662 --> 04:06.788
-Yes?
-Yes?

04:10.124 --> 04:12.585
-Hi.
-How are you?

04:17.757 --> 04:19.259
You're obviously single.

04:21.552 --> 04:23.054
Open the garage door.

04:33.064 --> 04:36.526
The ketamine and flunitrazepam levels

04:36.609 --> 04:40.071
Alice had upon registration
at the hospital were high,

04:40.989 --> 04:43.783
and she had brain damage,

04:44.993 --> 04:47.412
but she was going to recover.

04:48.162 --> 04:49.622
Why is she still like this?

04:50.331 --> 04:55.670
Because Simón Marroquín ordered me
to make sure she was,

04:55.753 --> 05:00.341
to prevent anyone from knowing
he had a daughter with her.

05:06.639 --> 05:08.016
-Hi.
-Hi.

05:17.984 --> 05:20.570
-Where are we going?
-It's a surprise.

05:21.362 --> 05:24.282
I don't like surprises.
I can't risk being seen.

05:25.283 --> 05:28.828
Okay.
It's the perfect place to go unnoticed.

05:29.370 --> 05:30.288
Trust me.

05:56.814 --> 05:59.692
Ignacio, Simón might be out all evening.

06:00.860 --> 06:02.612
He stays at the office?

06:09.911 --> 06:13.581
I always thought you deserved
someone better than my brother.

06:22.673 --> 06:25.593
You're too good for the bastard.

06:36.562 --> 06:37.688
Good night.

06:44.070 --> 06:44.987
Good night.

06:51.911 --> 06:52.995
Ready?

06:53.079 --> 06:54.080
There we go.

06:54.622 --> 06:55.706
-You're okay?
-Yes.

07:06.384 --> 07:08.302
Nobody ever called me beautiful.

07:09.720 --> 07:11.347
You're kidding. Seriously?

07:14.183 --> 07:16.227
They say I'm hot.

07:17.478 --> 07:19.981
That they like my tits, my butt.

07:21.315 --> 07:23.067
But no one's ever said that.

07:26.487 --> 07:29.198
It's the first thing I remember
when I think about you.

07:56.392 --> 07:58.019
How long is the movie?

07:59.353 --> 08:02.231
This one is like two hours.

08:03.774 --> 08:05.443
But there's another after.

08:06.068 --> 08:06.903
Perfect.

08:18.706 --> 08:20.958
I'm so sorry. It's all my fault.

08:21.584 --> 08:22.460
Look, Matilde.

08:23.211 --> 08:26.172
No woman is to blame if a man abuses her.

08:26.255 --> 08:27.882
There's no excuse.

08:28.549 --> 08:30.593
Why have you guys been so nice to me?

08:31.260 --> 08:33.262
You even welcomed me to your home.

08:33.804 --> 08:37.016
Easy, didn't you need somewhere to sleep?

08:37.600 --> 08:40.811
And the bar's so close
you'll never be late again.

08:43.856 --> 08:45.316
Get some rest.

08:47.485 --> 08:49.320
Thank you both for everything.

08:49.403 --> 08:51.280
-Don't mention it.
-Okay.

08:54.450 --> 08:55.284
Hey!

08:58.788 --> 09:03.042
That's funny, I have a postcard
just like this. Where did you get it?

09:03.125 --> 09:06.963
-Really? We bought it in…
-San Miguel de Allende.

09:08.839 --> 09:11.926
A couple of years ago.
They have nice things, right?

09:14.971 --> 09:15.930
That's weird.

09:17.974 --> 09:19.559
-Sweet dreams.
-Same to you.

09:25.481 --> 09:28.401
Honey, you need to talk to her.

09:29.944 --> 09:30.778
Soon.

09:33.739 --> 09:35.241
What a bastard!

09:36.200 --> 09:38.244
If only I was there!

09:39.370 --> 09:42.999
My hands will be sore for weeks,
but it's worth it.

09:43.541 --> 09:45.918
Is there a reason Daniel knows Simón?

09:46.586 --> 09:49.213
I saw them talking as if they did.

09:50.590 --> 09:51.882
-No.
-No?

09:52.550 --> 09:54.010
No way, because…

10:00.349 --> 10:01.183
What?

10:12.403 --> 10:13.321
Hi, Vale.

10:13.404 --> 10:15.114
How are you? Are you alright?

10:16.490 --> 10:17.575
Yes. I'm fine.

10:18.242 --> 10:20.661
I'm just mad
that our plan for Simón was ruined.

10:20.745 --> 10:23.247
Tomás told us
he saw Daniel and Simón talking.

10:24.206 --> 10:25.082
Tomás saw what?

10:27.084 --> 10:28.836
What do you mean?

10:28.919 --> 10:32.548
Think about it, Matilde.
Daniel's always been so nice to you.

10:32.632 --> 10:34.091
What if it's a plan?

10:34.175 --> 10:36.052
That doesn't make any sense.

10:36.135 --> 10:38.471
It does if he works for Simón.

10:38.554 --> 10:41.474
We know someone's helping him.
It could be Daniel.

10:41.557 --> 10:44.769
And hiring you was part of a plan
to keep you close.

10:48.147 --> 10:51.233
That's funny. I have one just like it.

10:52.109 --> 10:56.280
So he's the one that sent me postcards
all these years?

10:57.114 --> 11:00.451
That's impossible. I can't believe it.

11:26.602 --> 11:27.645
"DEAR MATILDE…"

11:27.728 --> 11:28.813
"CLAUDIO, HONEY…"

11:36.237 --> 11:38.572
What's the matter, Bruno?

11:39.365 --> 11:41.325
What's with all the barking?

11:43.285 --> 11:44.120
Matilde.

11:45.204 --> 11:46.205
Where are you going?

11:47.456 --> 11:48.374
I know everything.

11:49.709 --> 11:50.960
What do you mean?

11:51.669 --> 11:54.505
That Daniel works for my dad,
Simón Marroquín.

11:57.174 --> 11:58.008
Matilde.

12:01.762 --> 12:04.849
All these years
you made me think my mom was alive.

12:05.933 --> 12:07.893
How could you do that to me?

12:11.313 --> 12:14.525
You know what it's like
to think your mom doesn't love you?

12:17.278 --> 12:18.904
Do you or don't you?

12:19.780 --> 12:21.782
Do you know how painful it is?

12:23.284 --> 12:24.827
Where do I always have you?

12:27.997 --> 12:28.914
What?

12:29.749 --> 12:34.628
-Where do I always have you, baby?
-In your heart, and you're in mine.

12:42.094 --> 12:44.972
How do you know my mom always said that?

12:46.807 --> 12:47.933
How?

12:49.059 --> 12:50.102
Because it's me.

12:50.603 --> 12:51.479
Honey.

12:53.022 --> 12:53.898
It's me.

12:55.232 --> 12:56.066
What?

12:57.151 --> 12:58.861
-Come here.
-No!

13:03.240 --> 13:05.242
No, Matilde.

13:07.369 --> 13:09.455
No!

13:17.797 --> 13:19.048
It's her!

13:28.474 --> 13:32.144
Daniel is her! He's her!

13:54.083 --> 13:55.292
Did you get any sleep?

13:58.254 --> 13:59.255
You need to see him.

14:00.214 --> 14:01.757
I'm not sure I can.

14:03.008 --> 14:04.844
It's a lot to process,

14:05.511 --> 14:10.140
and I can't imagine how you feel,
but at least you didn't lose your mom.

14:10.683 --> 14:12.935
You're one of the few lucky ones.

14:13.644 --> 14:15.604
You need to tell him everything.

14:16.146 --> 14:18.983
Daniel could be in danger
if Simón recognized him.

14:22.236 --> 14:23.070
Okay.

14:23.863 --> 14:25.865
One, two, three, no cheating.

14:26.615 --> 14:27.533
Caridad.

14:29.702 --> 14:30.536
It's Alice.

14:35.875 --> 14:41.130
I knew she'd wake up soon,
but this is a miracle, Caridad.

14:42.590 --> 14:43.424
Hi, Mom.

14:44.675 --> 14:48.345
It's me, Juana Caridad, your daughter.
Remember me?

15:26.008 --> 15:27.092
What?

15:28.177 --> 15:31.013
You need to forget me.
You'll understand one day.

15:34.183 --> 15:36.352
WOMAN OF COURAGE CRAFT BEER

15:42.691 --> 15:43.734
You haven't answered.

15:43.817 --> 15:46.236
So the yes I yelled was in my head? Right?

15:58.082 --> 15:59.625
Valentina de la Paz.

16:00.501 --> 16:03.170
Yes. How can I help you?

16:03.253 --> 16:06.507
I'm Catalina. Simón Marroquín's wife.

16:06.590 --> 16:08.300
We need to talk.

16:08.968 --> 16:10.427
Sorry, I'm busy.

16:11.762 --> 16:13.305
I know you're Simón's kid.

16:17.017 --> 16:18.310
You want money?

16:18.394 --> 16:20.562
I'll give you whatever you need.

16:20.646 --> 16:21.647
Money?

16:24.942 --> 16:26.110
You're mistaken.

16:26.652 --> 16:29.947
So, you want him to recognize you
as his child.

16:32.741 --> 16:34.451
Your mother wouldn't agree.

16:36.996 --> 16:38.622
What do you know about my mom?

16:38.706 --> 16:40.165
That her name was Rosa.

16:41.375 --> 16:43.711
Simón got her pregnant
and forced her to abort.

16:43.794 --> 16:47.840
Exactly what you said
at the confirmation hearing.

16:57.474 --> 17:00.227
This came a year ago,
but Simón never saw it.

17:01.562 --> 17:03.564
So he knows nothing about you.

17:08.027 --> 17:09.903
I didn't do it to protect him.

17:10.863 --> 17:11.989
It was to protect you.

17:13.782 --> 17:17.036
Take my advice
and stay away from him, Valentina.

17:18.287 --> 17:20.873
You don't want a dad like Simón Marroquín.

17:26.503 --> 17:28.422
You didn't just protect me.

17:30.716 --> 17:32.634
You probably saved my life.

17:34.470 --> 17:36.346
Can we meet later?

17:37.639 --> 17:40.309
We do need to talk, but not here or now.

17:51.403 --> 17:52.821
Can we have a drink?

18:01.914 --> 18:05.918
I'm the same person.
Only my appearance changed and…

18:07.461 --> 18:08.295
And my voice.

18:10.255 --> 18:12.758
That was part of the transition.

18:13.759 --> 18:15.427
When did you get a sex change?

18:17.137 --> 18:20.849
When I met Claudio 15 years ago.
He gave me the strength.

18:23.227 --> 18:25.562
How did you find out about your father?

18:25.646 --> 18:27.981
First tell me how you met him.

18:30.567 --> 18:31.443
On a trip.

18:32.069 --> 18:34.154
I was just getting started.

18:34.780 --> 18:36.323
Simón was well connected.

18:37.116 --> 18:39.743
He wanted to launch my career.

18:41.161 --> 18:42.121
Where are we?

18:45.624 --> 18:50.129
The first time I woke up in a hotel
without remembering a thing,

18:50.212 --> 18:53.507
I believed Simón,
that I had too many drinks.

18:54.967 --> 18:59.263
The second time I got suspicious.
And the third…

18:59.763 --> 19:00.639
Okay.

19:10.065 --> 19:11.775
Three months later I knew I was…

19:13.861 --> 19:15.445
That I was expecting you.

19:16.822 --> 19:20.576
But I didn't have a clue.
I didn't know how to feel.

19:21.702 --> 19:25.038
I thought you'd be better off without me.

19:26.540 --> 19:27.708
The afternoon I left,

19:29.293 --> 19:30.335
I prayed to God

19:31.753 --> 19:35.632
to make us meet one day
so I could explain.

19:36.925 --> 19:41.805
To tell you I never stopped loving you
even for a single moment.

19:42.514 --> 19:46.435
And that you are all I care about.

19:48.270 --> 19:53.317
I bought this bar for you,
hoping you'd show up one day.

19:58.447 --> 20:00.824
That was my way of leaving it up to fate.

20:03.160 --> 20:05.787
And I know it was fate
that brought me here.

20:12.377 --> 20:13.462
The first night…

20:15.839 --> 20:18.967
I saw you sing on that stage…

20:20.260 --> 20:23.972
was the happiest moment of my life.

20:27.059 --> 20:28.644
What's wrong, honey?

20:30.646 --> 20:32.940
This is the happiest day of mine.

20:40.948 --> 20:42.032
I love you so much.

20:48.497 --> 20:50.707
He said he'd be here at 5:00.

20:50.791 --> 20:52.334
I'm on my way out. Bye.

20:53.377 --> 20:55.212
Have you heard from Gregorio?

20:57.798 --> 21:00.008
No. He hasn't called all day.

21:00.092 --> 21:01.093
Isn't that weird?

21:01.176 --> 21:04.471
We were going to discuss
his permanent position.

21:06.306 --> 21:10.978
I think you're overworking him.
He stayed until late again last night.

21:13.313 --> 21:15.732
Sorry. I have a meeting.

21:16.817 --> 21:18.026
-Bye.
-Good luck.

21:22.990 --> 21:24.783
Thanks for coming, Catalina.

21:33.500 --> 21:34.334
Susana.

21:35.794 --> 21:37.629
I'll be back later.

21:41.800 --> 21:43.468
When did you find out about her?

21:45.512 --> 21:48.682
When Simón tried to kill Manny, Cata.

21:53.312 --> 21:54.146
Aunt.

21:56.356 --> 21:59.484
Have a seat. This won't be easy.

22:03.530 --> 22:06.783
You'll need to have me committed, dude.

22:06.867 --> 22:09.411
-You're not there, right?
-I'm desperate!

22:09.494 --> 22:13.457
I don't care if she calls the cops.
Wish me luck.

22:13.540 --> 22:16.460
Get out of there, damn it,
for you own good!

22:17.627 --> 22:19.713
Don't touch me!

22:19.796 --> 22:22.132
-I'll call you back.
-No, dude!

22:22.215 --> 22:24.134
-No!
-Wait. Please.

22:24.217 --> 22:27.637
Catalina, wait, please.

22:28.847 --> 22:31.683
Let me explain, please, don't go.

22:36.730 --> 22:37.939
What happened?

22:38.774 --> 22:41.610
I told her everything and she got…

22:52.162 --> 22:55.499
It's the toughest thing
I've ever had to do.

22:57.000 --> 22:59.795
She'll forgive you in due time.

22:59.878 --> 23:03.048
-I worry about what she'll do.
-Will she tell Simón?

23:03.131 --> 23:07.260
No, she's devastated, but she won't.
I know my sister.

23:08.595 --> 23:11.431
She might even want to see him
get what he deserves.

23:13.308 --> 23:15.143
-I want to go home.
-Yes.

23:23.610 --> 23:24.694
-Ready?
-Yes.

23:31.910 --> 23:33.328
What the hell! Manny?

23:38.166 --> 23:40.752
-Let me explain, Federico.
-Explain what?

23:42.337 --> 23:44.256
All five of us are Simón's kids.

23:50.971 --> 23:51.888
You and me…

23:54.391 --> 23:55.767
we're siblings.

23:57.644 --> 23:58.812
What? No.

23:59.438 --> 24:01.064
We have the same birthmark.

24:02.107 --> 24:03.066
In the same spot.

24:05.277 --> 24:06.736
We got it from your dad.

24:08.196 --> 24:12.701
He tried to kill me
when I showed it to him.

24:14.619 --> 24:16.413
I barely escaped.

24:17.998 --> 24:19.791
It's his fault my mom died.

24:21.710 --> 24:25.464
He locked mine up so she'd die
and no one would know I was born,

24:25.547 --> 24:28.592
and he forced Valentina's mom
to have an abortion.

24:28.675 --> 24:31.470
He raped my mom and Bautista's mom.

24:31.553 --> 24:32.888
Simón is sick.

24:33.763 --> 24:36.475
We're gathering evidence
to make him turn himself in.

24:41.521 --> 24:45.150
-Does my mom know?
-I just told her everything.

25:00.624 --> 25:04.127
-Federico, please wait!
-When did you find out?

25:05.670 --> 25:08.632
-The night I waited for you at the hotel.
-I knew it.

25:08.715 --> 25:10.592
Manny told us.

25:12.177 --> 25:15.222
I can't believe it.
This is a freaking nightmare.

25:15.805 --> 25:17.015
I know.

25:17.974 --> 25:18.934
Do you get it now?

25:19.559 --> 25:22.187
Do you see why we can't be together?

25:23.605 --> 25:24.731
Even if you hate me.

25:26.900 --> 25:30.278
I swear I wanted to wait
for the best time,

25:30.362 --> 25:32.822
the very best time to tell you.

25:32.906 --> 25:36.409
-You could've told me earlier!
-No, I couldn't!

25:38.203 --> 25:42.082
I'm doing this for you and me
and our moms.

25:42.165 --> 25:43.124
Bullshit.

25:43.208 --> 25:45.919
-Wait.
-What do you want?

25:46.002 --> 25:50.006
You can't tell him
now that we're almost there.

25:52.842 --> 25:53.677
Federico!

25:54.928 --> 25:55.762
Damn!

26:00.517 --> 26:01.476
Damn!

26:13.446 --> 26:17.701
Your mom went to Valle de Bravo
to think things out.

26:18.577 --> 26:19.953
I need to be with her.

26:20.537 --> 26:21.997
No, Fede, let her be.

26:22.998 --> 26:25.333
I never saw her so calm and clear-headed.

26:26.167 --> 26:28.169
She needs to be alone.

26:29.838 --> 26:31.965
Mom's gone if you want to know.

26:34.259 --> 26:36.094
Are you drunk or high or what?

26:39.264 --> 26:41.224
I have no time for your crap.

26:43.101 --> 26:44.519
Son of a bitch.

26:45.895 --> 26:48.440
I only wanted you to be proud of me.

26:49.774 --> 26:52.611
To love me.
And part of me wanted to be like you.

26:53.820 --> 26:55.238
I was such a fool.

26:56.865 --> 26:59.784
You will never be like me.

27:00.619 --> 27:04.205
Because you're weak,
as weak as your mom and mine.

27:05.373 --> 27:06.458
You have no idea

27:07.834 --> 27:10.712
of the sacrifices you must make
to be successful.

27:11.296 --> 27:13.423
You're a coward and a hypocrite.

27:13.965 --> 27:17.510
No wonder your crazy world
is crumbling around you.

27:17.594 --> 27:21.806
There's no one you can trust.
You're the one that knows nothing.

27:23.850 --> 27:27.270
-Tell me what you know or else…
-What? You'll kill me?

27:29.314 --> 27:30.940
I'm not fighting back.

27:35.403 --> 27:37.280
You don't need to drug me.

27:42.911 --> 27:44.496
Fede!

27:54.631 --> 27:57.050
I'll go. Claudio, take over, please.

28:08.978 --> 28:10.105
Who are you, dude?

28:12.899 --> 28:14.234
What do you know about me?

28:22.617 --> 28:23.785
It was you, right?

28:26.579 --> 28:28.081
You called me last night.

28:28.915 --> 28:30.333
You're behind all this.

28:31.126 --> 28:32.711
Go, or I'll call the cops.

28:33.461 --> 28:37.632
Screw the cops. Who are you?
I know you, asshole.

28:38.216 --> 28:40.218
I recognize you, motherfucker.

28:40.301 --> 28:44.013
The last time you tried to do this,
I was drugged, bitch,

28:44.097 --> 28:46.307
at your favorite hotel.

28:48.435 --> 28:50.437
With the third-floor bar.

28:52.063 --> 28:56.568
Where you'd introduce me
to Mexico's best booking agent.

28:58.737 --> 28:59.821
Let me go, Simón!

28:59.904 --> 29:03.658
You're choking me, I can't breathe.
Let me go.

29:10.749 --> 29:12.125
You are Dominga.

29:32.979 --> 29:34.439
They screwed you, Simón.

29:37.192 --> 29:38.276
What did you expect?

29:39.068 --> 29:41.070
You kept Alice drugged for 20 years.

29:52.332 --> 29:53.166
Hey.

29:56.252 --> 29:58.171
Sorry. I forgot about dinner.

30:00.256 --> 30:01.633
It was a long day.

30:03.802 --> 30:06.554
I had a huge fight with Dad.
Things aren't good.

30:08.056 --> 30:09.933
Mom is in Valle de Bravo and…

30:12.393 --> 30:15.271
Don't get me wrong, Uncle,
but I need to be alone.

30:15.814 --> 30:18.274
Of course. No problem.

30:19.275 --> 30:22.362
You know you can count on me
for anything, right?

30:22.946 --> 30:23.905
Come here.

30:29.077 --> 30:31.037
I'll only take a minute. Thanks.

30:42.215 --> 30:43.091
Fuck.

30:44.467 --> 30:46.344
I know how important these papers are

30:46.427 --> 30:49.639
and how they could affect
the Senate's decision on Monday.

30:50.515 --> 30:54.853
That's why I'm here, Mr. Marroquín.
I assure you I don't want any money.

30:55.937 --> 31:01.776
All I want is your support for my project
which I've dreamed of all my life.

31:03.027 --> 31:04.988
Having my own magazine.

31:05.071 --> 31:08.324
And someone with your contacts
and influence could…

31:09.784 --> 31:11.035
open a lot of doors.

31:12.203 --> 31:14.539
Of course, your family's foundation

31:14.622 --> 31:20.003
could donate the funds
for the entire logistical effort.

31:20.086 --> 31:22.505
Bautista, they're gone.

31:23.548 --> 31:27.010
The safe is empty.
The papers and everything else is gone.

31:27.802 --> 31:30.597
I don't understand.

31:32.765 --> 31:36.936
Have you seen Gregorio?
He worked late last night again.

31:38.104 --> 31:42.567
Here, do whatever you want with it.

31:43.067 --> 31:44.819
Are there more copies?

31:44.903 --> 31:45.737
Yes.

31:47.405 --> 31:51.367
In my PC, but I'll delete them
when we cut a deal.

31:52.577 --> 31:53.912
I give you my word.

31:56.581 --> 31:59.208
You were right to come to me
and not my son.

32:12.972 --> 32:15.433
I'm withdrawing my candidacy as minister.

32:16.309 --> 32:18.770
I'm tired, exhausted, Dad,

32:18.853 --> 32:21.898
of covering up all my crap,
this whole circus.

32:22.523 --> 32:24.317
It's driving me crazy, Dad.

32:24.400 --> 32:27.195
I need peace, I need a break.

32:31.366 --> 32:34.369
Please say you understand.
I need your help.

32:44.712 --> 32:48.967
You think I worked all my life
for you to give me this crap?

32:49.550 --> 32:50.802
Wake up, damn it!

32:51.678 --> 32:54.722
Be a man! Do what you need to do!

33:02.355 --> 33:05.441
Take a shower and shake off
whatever's bothering you.

33:05.525 --> 33:10.655
And come back sober tomorrow
to talk to me sensibly, got it?

33:11.447 --> 33:15.576
How much of your crap
are you hiding with this nomination?

33:17.120 --> 33:18.579
It must be really bad.

33:19.747 --> 33:21.374
Mom found out, didn't she?

33:21.916 --> 33:25.920
Your mom killed herself
because she was weak, you moron.

33:27.964 --> 33:28.965
Víctor!

33:32.593 --> 33:33.678
Take him home.

33:38.808 --> 33:40.643
You're the one they'll screw over.

33:41.185 --> 33:42.270
Listen up.

33:43.146 --> 33:45.023
I was your puppet until today.

33:47.108 --> 33:48.568
You used me until today.

33:49.652 --> 33:51.904
And I'm totally sober.

33:52.864 --> 33:56.576
And I couldn't care less
what happens to me.

33:59.829 --> 34:02.081
But watch it, dude.

34:03.583 --> 34:05.752
Brace yourself for what's coming.

34:07.128 --> 34:09.005
Because I'm telling everything.

34:11.507 --> 34:12.341
Everything!

34:13.801 --> 34:16.679
My son can't drive. Take care of him.

35:07.814 --> 35:08.981
-Hi.
-Come in.

35:09.732 --> 35:12.443
I heard you came here alone.

35:13.361 --> 35:14.195
Are you okay?

35:16.531 --> 35:18.991
You came all the way here
just to see if I'm okay?

35:19.909 --> 35:22.829
I don't know if it's resignation, Víctor.

35:25.164 --> 35:27.125
But knowing when I confess everything,

35:28.584 --> 35:30.336
I will finally be free,

35:31.254 --> 35:33.089
is such a relief.

35:33.172 --> 35:34.799
Think about it, Boss.

35:36.175 --> 35:39.053
As a minister on Monday,
you can solve all that.

35:39.846 --> 35:41.556
There's no going back now.

35:43.182 --> 35:44.183
It's over.

35:46.727 --> 35:47.854
It's all gone to hell.

35:51.023 --> 35:52.650
You're screwed too, Víctor.

35:53.818 --> 35:56.112
I'm sorry, but you are too.

36:08.708 --> 36:12.211
Have some, Boss. You'll feel a lot better.

36:13.713 --> 36:16.048
I'll be outside if you need me.

36:46.871 --> 36:50.541
I felt very lucky that someone like Simón
noticed me.

36:50.625 --> 36:54.754
Handsome, from a prominent family,
with a great future.

36:54.837 --> 36:58.341
I was so obsessed,
I would've done anything to have him.

36:59.383 --> 37:04.430
It took me two years of marriage
to realize how mistaken I was.

37:05.139 --> 37:06.474
I know how it feels.

37:08.059 --> 37:09.894
But you can still be happy.

37:09.977 --> 37:10.895
You're young.

37:13.147 --> 37:13.981
Beautiful.

37:16.317 --> 37:20.488
You can start a new life without him.

37:21.530 --> 37:24.700
You're the eternal optimist.

37:27.453 --> 37:29.163
I probably am.

37:29.747 --> 37:33.542
It's a shame that wasn't enough
for you to fall in love with me.

37:37.296 --> 37:41.133
Don't you know how I feel about you?

37:42.426 --> 37:46.347
Since that night we spent together.

37:46.430 --> 37:49.934
I had a fight with Simón.
I shouldn't have kissed you.

37:50.017 --> 37:52.645
I was angry.

37:54.605 --> 37:59.568
We didn't have sex that night,
we made love.

38:01.862 --> 38:04.240
It's been 25 years.

38:06.158 --> 38:10.705
And I haven't stopped loving you
for an instant.

39:08.721 --> 39:09.555
Hello.

39:14.727 --> 39:19.273
I may not be the best chef in the world,
but I can make you some eggs and bacon.

39:19.982 --> 39:21.650
Something happened to Simón.

39:30.159 --> 39:31.077
Simón!

39:35.247 --> 39:36.499
Where is Simón?

39:36.582 --> 39:38.793
-Where is Simón?
-Mom, please.

39:38.876 --> 39:41.045
-Where is he?
-He committed suicide.

39:41.128 --> 39:43.464
That's a lie! He'd never do that!

39:43.964 --> 39:46.884
That's a lie!

39:51.806 --> 39:53.474
No! Damn it!

40:01.315 --> 40:03.317
-It's not necessary…
-Leave me.

40:14.954 --> 40:17.581
The coroner just examined the body.

40:18.124 --> 40:20.000
It's clearly a suicide.

40:20.584 --> 40:21.502
It's our fault?

40:21.585 --> 40:25.381
We didn't want him to die.
It's not our fault.

40:25.965 --> 40:29.385
I'm not so sure, Bautista.
If Gregorio showed him the proof…

40:29.468 --> 40:32.596
-He chose death over dealing with it.
-I'd rather see him in jail.

40:34.515 --> 40:36.100
The bastard had it coming.

40:37.268 --> 40:39.103
I only feel sorry for Federico.

40:48.362 --> 40:51.574
Listen, Federico. It's not your fault.

40:54.034 --> 40:56.078
Our conscience can be ruthless.

40:56.162 --> 41:00.249
I don't feel guilty,
but ashamed of what he did.

41:01.250 --> 41:02.501
All the harm he did.

41:07.173 --> 41:10.092
-I'd do anything to not be his son.
-Fede!

41:12.470 --> 41:14.138
I'm going away for a while.

41:15.931 --> 41:20.269
My uncle says he can wait a few months
to open the business.

41:20.853 --> 41:23.689
Okay, honey. It will do you a lot of good.

41:25.107 --> 41:27.526
You know you can count on me, right?

41:27.610 --> 41:28.486
Yes.

41:54.762 --> 41:55.596
Cata.

41:57.223 --> 41:59.016
I need you to forgive me.

41:59.892 --> 42:01.685
I only care about Manny and you.

42:03.020 --> 42:05.105
And I refuse to lose either of you.

42:07.066 --> 42:10.486
A life so full of secrets
must've been horrible.

42:11.445 --> 42:14.949
You sacrificed yourself to protect me.

42:20.454 --> 42:22.248
I'm so sorry, Susi.

42:46.730 --> 42:49.233
-We never meant to…
-I know.

42:51.235 --> 42:52.653
I'm not blaming you.

42:53.821 --> 42:54.822
Any of you.

42:56.574 --> 42:58.242
My dad did some awful things.

42:59.535 --> 43:03.038
He didn't deserve to die like that,
but he couldn't bear being in jail.

43:03.539 --> 43:06.542
I should've told you the truth
at the hotel.

43:09.169 --> 43:10.504
I was in shock.

43:12.673 --> 43:13.507
I couldn't.

43:15.384 --> 43:16.802
Even now that I know…

43:24.059 --> 43:26.395
I'm not sure I can stop loving you.

43:32.318 --> 43:33.319
Me neither.

43:35.988 --> 43:37.239
But what can we do?

43:38.907 --> 43:40.701
Love each other as siblings?

43:49.460 --> 43:51.295
Take care, Valentina.

44:16.779 --> 44:18.989
We didn't want this to happen.

44:19.698 --> 44:22.201
If we had thought this would happen…

44:22.284 --> 44:26.955
No, Simón did what he did
because he decided to.

44:27.790 --> 44:29.375
But it's not your fault.

44:29.458 --> 44:32.795
It's the opposite.
You're just his victims.

44:33.379 --> 44:34.463
Like your moms.

44:52.731 --> 44:56.735
I can't keep it from you anymore.
They are the daughters…

44:56.819 --> 44:57.653
Simón's.

44:57.736 --> 44:58.946
That's right.

44:59.738 --> 45:00.781
I thought so.

45:01.949 --> 45:04.451
He confessed everything the night before…

45:06.078 --> 45:09.248
On his behalf, I ask for your forgiveness.

45:10.582 --> 45:13.919
I know that won't heal the pain.

45:14.753 --> 45:19.925
But as far as I'm concerned,
you are my granddaughters.

45:20.008 --> 45:23.637
And if there's anything I can do
to repair all the damage,

45:24.638 --> 45:26.140
please let me know.

45:27.015 --> 45:29.435
You are always welcome in my home.

45:54.460 --> 45:56.879
Dig up everything
about those bitches, Víctor,

45:57.671 --> 46:00.007
even the tiniest details of their past.

46:00.549 --> 46:04.052
They'll regret the day they were born
for killing my son.

47:51.618 --> 47:53.745
