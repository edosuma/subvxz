Why do you do that?
Mrs. Mackenzie?

34:18.911 --> 34:22.210
That.
It is a custom
to show respect.

Respect?
What do you know of respect?
Telling people how fat they are.

34:26.286 --> 34:28.379
Please, Mrs. Mackenzie.
It was a mistake.

I'm sick of your mistakes.
I beg your forgiveness.

Well, where is she?
She went out.

Out?
What do you mean out?
God knows what these people do.

35:31.785 --> 35:34.879
She's probably running naked

Where are you going?

Well, see, there's this guy

And he comes back
after he gets both of his arms
blown off.

rotting away in the Pacific,

38:17.551 --> 38:20.952
when I should have been here
playing ball.

38:21.021 --> 38:22.989
You see, I had an arm.

Yankees wanted me.
The Orioles, the Indians.
They all wanted me.

38:29.563 --> 38:32.555
I had a curve, a sinker.
