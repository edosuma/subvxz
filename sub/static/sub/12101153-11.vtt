WEBVTT

00:01.479 --> 00:02.698
[Lena] Previously
onSupergirl...

00:02.741 --> 00:04.526
I'd do anything
to just know my mom.

00:04.569 --> 00:07.007
You know, my Phantom Fear
Vision was about her.

00:07.050 --> 00:10.706
Facing that Phantom
allowed me to break through
and finally let go.

00:10.749 --> 00:11.968
I'm gonna go home.

00:12.012 --> 00:13.100
-To Luthor Mansion?
- No.

00:13.143 --> 00:14.884
To where I was born.

00:14.927 --> 00:15.972
[Nyxly] I'm free.

00:16.016 --> 00:17.669
I haven't forgotten our deal.

00:17.713 --> 00:19.715
You will have your mother back
for one day, as promised.

00:19.758 --> 00:21.891
But this will sap
the last of my power.

00:21.934 --> 00:23.545
My darling, what have you done?

00:23.588 --> 00:25.416
You've unleashed
a force of hell on earth.

00:25.460 --> 00:27.549
We picked up
an energy signature
coming from the Ormfell.

00:27.592 --> 00:29.290
It could be residual
from my heat vision.

00:31.727 --> 00:32.945
-Nyxly.
-Miss me?

00:35.948 --> 00:37.211
No!

00:37.254 --> 00:38.299
[Nyxly] You're bound
by magic now.

00:38.342 --> 00:39.517
And only magic can beat magic.

00:39.561 --> 00:40.605
Mr. Mxyzptlk!

00:49.527 --> 00:52.008
[Mr. Mxyzptlk] Nyxlygsptlnz?
Supergirl?

00:52.052 --> 00:53.401
Mxy, get me out of here.

00:53.444 --> 00:54.750
No, you don't.

00:54.793 --> 00:55.751
He's mine.

00:59.450 --> 01:01.061
What is she talking about?
I summoned you.

01:02.845 --> 01:04.542
Unfortunately, you both did.

01:04.586 --> 01:06.849
Although it is lovely to see
you again, Your Highness.

01:06.892 --> 01:08.546
Really?

01:08.590 --> 01:10.461
Better than 300 years ago
when you stood before a judge

01:10.505 --> 01:12.942
and called me... crazy.

01:12.985 --> 01:15.901
You were trying to destroy
most of the Fifth Dimension.

01:15.945 --> 01:17.599
Only those that betrayed me.

01:17.642 --> 01:19.383
But not to worry.

01:19.427 --> 01:20.863
Now you'll get
what you deserve.

01:21.994 --> 01:23.431
[buzzing]

01:23.474 --> 01:25.607
I thought you two were friends.

01:25.650 --> 01:27.739
Long story. Just know imps
can track each other
when they use magic.

01:27.783 --> 01:29.480
So when I snap you
out of there,

01:29.524 --> 01:32.179
be ready to fly us away
like our lives depended on it.

01:33.223 --> 01:34.572
[buzzing]

01:36.922 --> 01:37.836
Three, two, one!

01:51.328 --> 01:52.982
Her name is Nyxly?

01:53.025 --> 01:56.507
Officially,
the Princess Nyxlygsptlnz.

01:56.551 --> 01:59.336
Whatever it is, she is the
reason that my father and I

01:59.380 --> 02:02.165
almost stayed trapped in
the Phantom Zone forever.

02:02.209 --> 02:04.820
And the reason I wouldn't be
here if Mxy hadn't saved me.

02:04.863 --> 02:06.474
And before
anyone says anything,

02:06.517 --> 02:08.563
I know I should have told
you guys about her sooner,

02:08.606 --> 02:10.695
but I really didn't think
I would ever see her again.

02:10.739 --> 02:12.480
She must have hitched a ride
on the Tower ship

02:12.523 --> 02:14.351
when we portal-jumped
back to Earth.

02:14.395 --> 02:16.223
The Coluan is right.

02:16.266 --> 02:19.661
But she was going to escape
the Phantom Zone
sooner or later.

02:19.704 --> 02:20.923
What do you mean?

02:20.966 --> 02:22.316
What she'd learned
from her father.

02:23.708 --> 02:24.709
You're kidding?

02:24.753 --> 02:26.885
Wicked King Brpxz?

02:26.929 --> 02:29.323
Doesn't ring a bell? Wow, okay.

02:29.366 --> 02:30.672
I can explain everything.

02:30.715 --> 02:33.196
-Whoa! Whoa!
-Wait, wait.

02:33.240 --> 02:35.720
You told Supergirl
that you could sense
each other's energies.

02:35.764 --> 02:38.201
That means that even with
the Tower's cloaking shields,

02:38.245 --> 02:40.029
Nyxly can track
your magic here.

02:41.378 --> 02:42.858
Okay.

02:42.901 --> 02:44.207
I can explain everything

02:45.556 --> 02:48.080
with words.

02:48.124 --> 02:49.908

04:01.502 --> 04:03.939
Because she told me
that her brother was dead.

04:03.982 --> 04:05.941
That her father killed him.

04:05.984 --> 04:07.943
She was probably
speaking metaphorically.

04:07.986 --> 04:10.293
I mean, since they both
rebelled and she was banished

04:10.337 --> 04:13.818
and the golden son
was rewarded,
he's probably dead to her.

04:13.862 --> 04:17.039
Okay, fine.
But what are these totems?

04:17.082 --> 04:19.084
And what's this AllStone?

04:19.128 --> 04:22.044
Thousands of years ago,
there was an evil imp
named Jyrryd,

04:22.087 --> 04:24.742
and he created
an all-powerful AllStone

04:24.786 --> 04:28.311
to give him mastery
over... everything.

04:28.355 --> 04:30.661
"Everything," as in...

04:30.705 --> 04:35.013
Everything. Energy, matter,
magic, even life and death.

04:35.057 --> 04:36.667
The other imps
found out about it.

04:36.711 --> 04:39.279
They banished Jyrryd
and they blew up the AllStone,

04:39.322 --> 04:41.977
scattering the pieces
throughout the known universes

04:42.020 --> 04:44.414
where they became
the totems of truth,

04:44.458 --> 04:48.766
destiny, love, dreams, hope,
humanity and courage.

04:48.810 --> 04:50.899
Pretty much
every planet has a set.

04:50.942 --> 04:52.553
[Brainy] I'm sorry,
but what does any of this
have to do with Nyxly

04:52.596 --> 04:54.294
showing up to
put you in a crystal?

04:54.337 --> 04:58.167
Nyxly needs the totems...
to make a new AllStone,

04:58.210 --> 05:01.866
but the totems can be disguised
as literally anything,

05:01.910 --> 05:04.347
so she needs
a magical orb to find them.

05:04.391 --> 05:05.392
Jyrryd's crystal.

05:05.435 --> 05:07.611
So it's like a homing beacon?

05:07.655 --> 05:10.701
[Kara] She had a crystal ball
at the Ormfell and
in the Phantom Zone.

05:10.745 --> 05:13.487
To give power to the crystal,
the orb needs to have an imp

05:13.530 --> 05:16.054
with the blood
of Jyrryd inside it.

05:16.098 --> 05:21.321
And guess who has
two thumbs and is
Jyrryd's last descendant?

05:21.364 --> 05:22.931
[Mr. Mxyzptlk] It's also why
I had to testify against Nyxly.

05:22.974 --> 05:24.846
King Brpxz made me, by the way.

05:24.889 --> 05:28.023
Nyxly wants to capture you
in her crystal,

05:28.066 --> 05:30.721
which she can use
to find the seven totems

05:30.765 --> 05:32.244
that will give her
ultimate power.

05:33.420 --> 05:34.899
Or we could say it...

05:34.943 --> 05:37.032
-From the bridge, everybody.
-[Alex] Stop.

05:37.075 --> 05:37.902
No.

05:48.739 --> 05:50.132
We can still fix this.

05:51.263 --> 05:52.917
It's all my fault.

05:52.961 --> 05:54.745
[Brainy] That's not true.

05:54.789 --> 05:56.399
It's not like you
consciously chose

05:56.443 --> 05:59.228
to bring an insane imp
to terrorize the Earth.

05:59.271 --> 06:01.883
[J'onn J'onzz] Still,
if things are as you say
with the Ormfell Building bomb,

06:01.926 --> 06:04.146
Nyxly used Dr. Raab's plans
to build a device

06:04.189 --> 06:08.585
that could transform
Kryptonian powers
into Fifth Dimensional energy.

06:08.629 --> 06:12.284
If that's how
she repowered herself,
couldn't we reverse the plans

06:12.328 --> 06:13.938
to build something
to depower her?

06:15.853 --> 06:16.811
We can still do this.

06:19.291 --> 06:20.684
Wow.

06:20.728 --> 06:22.599
You would do all this
just for me?

06:22.643 --> 06:24.079
That and to save the universe.

06:24.122 --> 06:25.559
Don't worry.

06:25.602 --> 06:27.125
Nobody puts Mxy
in a crystal on our watch.

06:42.837 --> 06:44.708
[birds screeching]

06:49.104 --> 06:50.714
Nia, are you all right?

06:54.588 --> 06:55.719
[Brainy] Nia?

06:55.763 --> 06:58.679
Hmm?

06:58.722 --> 07:03.423
Yeah, just trying to track down
where the police
are keeping Mitch.

07:03.466 --> 07:07.339
He may know something,
too, but their system
is just so slow.

07:08.906 --> 07:10.212
We swore "no more secrets."

07:13.998 --> 07:15.478
All right. Follow me.

07:25.532 --> 07:29.274
So you brought Nyxly
out of the dream realm

07:29.318 --> 07:31.189
in exchange
for seeing your mother?

07:31.233 --> 07:33.148
[Nia] I know.

07:33.191 --> 07:36.064
My mother made it
perfectly clear what a
bad decision it was.

07:36.107 --> 07:38.196
-It's horrible. I'm horrible.
-No.

07:39.807 --> 07:40.677
Nia.

07:41.852 --> 07:43.071
Nyxly used you.

07:43.114 --> 07:44.942
That doesn't matter.

07:44.986 --> 07:49.556
Now I'm dreaming of Mxy,
dead in some awful
imp ice cage.

07:49.599 --> 07:52.428
I let Nyxly out with
no way to stop her.

07:52.472 --> 07:54.865
Do you remember
when Lex used me?

07:54.909 --> 07:56.693
When he did, I was certain
we were all going to have

07:56.737 --> 07:58.521
an awful future
which I couldn't stop.

07:58.565 --> 08:02.525
And then you and the rest of
our friends helped defeat him

08:02.569 --> 08:04.527
and changed the future
for the better.

08:06.268 --> 08:07.791
So what should I do?

08:07.835 --> 08:10.446
Focus on stopping
this imp with the rest of us.

08:12.579 --> 08:14.015
And tell Kara.

08:14.058 --> 08:15.669
No, I can't.

08:15.712 --> 08:18.541
I did the exact opposite
of what a real hero would do.

08:18.585 --> 08:20.674
She would lose
all respect for me.

08:20.717 --> 08:23.459
She'll understand
that Nyxly manipulated you.

08:23.503 --> 08:24.982
She's on the same team
as you are...

08:26.593 --> 08:27.550
As am I.

08:29.073 --> 08:31.989
Then just help me
figure this out, myself.

08:33.817 --> 08:34.775
Please?

08:52.749 --> 08:54.272
[cell phone ringing]

08:55.752 --> 08:57.058
-Andrea?
- Lena!

08:57.101 --> 08:58.450
How's Newfoundland?

08:58.494 --> 09:00.931
Full of charming coastline.

09:00.975 --> 09:03.412
And an easy journey,
thanks to the CatCo jet.

09:03.455 --> 09:05.545
It was my pleasure.

09:05.588 --> 09:08.199
You know, I have to say,
I think the last time
you sounded this good

09:08.243 --> 09:10.332
was back in boarding school.

09:10.375 --> 09:12.377
For so many years, thoughts
of my mother caused me
so much pain.

09:12.421 --> 09:15.990
But... you know, to finally
have moved past that,

09:16.033 --> 09:18.601
to be in the town
where she grew up...

09:18.645 --> 09:19.994
Frankly, it's a relief.

09:21.996 --> 09:24.476
By the way, did you get
that picture I texted you?

09:24.520 --> 09:27.741
I did. You are
your mother's spitting image.

09:27.784 --> 09:30.004
[Andrea] But who are
the others?

09:30.047 --> 09:31.701
[Lena] Based on the letters
I found in Maine
they're her childhood friends,

09:31.745 --> 09:34.182
Florence Abbott
and Margaret Bishop.

09:34.225 --> 09:37.925
If my research is correct,
Margaret still lives
in Fortune Bay.

09:37.968 --> 09:39.927
There's so much
I don't know about my mother.

09:39.970 --> 09:41.842
I'm hoping she can
fill in the gaps.

09:41.885 --> 09:43.844
Promise you'll let me know if
there's anything else I can do.

09:43.887 --> 09:45.759
Actually, there is.

09:45.802 --> 09:47.499
The other woman
in the photo on the right,

09:47.543 --> 09:49.763
Florence, I haven't
been able to locate her.

09:49.806 --> 09:52.722
If having a media empire
is good for one thing,
it's digging things up.

09:52.766 --> 09:54.637
I'll call you
if I have something.

09:54.681 --> 09:56.900
Until then, happy hunting.

09:56.944 --> 09:58.467
Thanks. Bye.

10:12.307 --> 10:14.657
-Ms. Luthor?
-Hello.

10:14.701 --> 10:16.093
It is you!

10:16.137 --> 10:18.008
I'm Dee-Dee, your innkeeper.

10:18.052 --> 10:20.881
And may I say we are honored
to have you in our town.

10:20.924 --> 10:22.099
In our inn!

10:22.143 --> 10:24.188
-Do you have bags? David!
-Yeah.

10:25.625 --> 10:27.627
Hello, ma'am.

10:27.670 --> 10:31.021
So what brings you
to our corner of the island?
Luthor business?

10:31.065 --> 10:33.415
It's not business at all.
It's personal.

10:33.458 --> 10:34.677
My mother grew up here.

10:34.721 --> 10:36.679
Your mother? How wonderful.

10:36.723 --> 10:38.899
Six degrees
of separation and all.

10:38.942 --> 10:40.727
-What was her name?
-Elizabeth Walsh.

10:41.771 --> 10:42.642
[thuds]

10:48.560 --> 10:50.258
[whispering] She was
just a dirty witch.

10:50.301 --> 10:52.956
Excuse me?

10:53.000 --> 10:56.046
We're sorry, Ms. Luthor,
but it seems your room's
double-booked.

10:56.830 --> 10:58.309
What?

10:58.353 --> 10:59.963
Sadly, we don't have
a room for you after all.

11:00.877 --> 11:01.791
You need to go.

11:09.059 --> 11:11.192
These are the plans that
Nyxly had Dr. Raab build

11:11.235 --> 11:13.498
to jumpstart her magic
with Supergirl's energy.

11:13.542 --> 11:15.805
Looks like it could be
reverse-engineered.

11:15.849 --> 11:18.765
[Nia] The trick will be
finding a way to keep
the device locked on Nyxly.

11:18.808 --> 11:20.854
Well, I have a fix for that.

11:20.897 --> 11:23.900
We modify a DEO
power-dampener into a cuff
that Nyxly can't unlock.

11:25.772 --> 11:27.991
-This is great.
We could do this.
-[Brainy] Not yet.

11:28.035 --> 11:31.473
The re-engineered device
will need a constant
magical power source.

11:31.516 --> 11:33.475
Or we hit her with this.

11:33.997 --> 11:34.998
No!

11:35.042 --> 11:35.999
The Phantom Zone projector.

11:36.043 --> 11:37.740
Oh. Whoa, whoa. No, no.

11:37.784 --> 11:39.829
From what I understand,
one blast from that gal

11:39.873 --> 11:42.876
will render her powerless
and send her back to
from whence she came.

11:42.919 --> 11:45.574
-All in favor, say "aye."
-No.

11:45.617 --> 11:47.097
Mxy, I've been thinking,

11:47.141 --> 11:50.405
ever since you told us
what happened to Nyxly...

11:50.448 --> 11:53.713
She is troubled, but she has
also been wrongly persecuted.

11:53.756 --> 11:54.801
She is still dangerous.

11:54.844 --> 11:56.890
Only with magical powers.

11:56.933 --> 11:59.240
So if we take those
away from her, I can
try to get her to see

11:59.283 --> 12:00.763
that revenge is
never the answer.

12:00.807 --> 12:03.026
We just need a way
to power this device.

12:03.070 --> 12:04.985
Didn't Mon-El use
something magical against you

12:05.028 --> 12:06.421
when he fought you
for Kara's hand?

12:06.464 --> 12:08.640
Yes, that's right. That amulet.

12:08.684 --> 12:10.904
Except you destroyed it.

12:10.947 --> 12:14.516
I actually hid it in a place
that nobody would ever find it.

12:14.559 --> 12:16.692
In a cave,
in the jungle in Corto Maltese.

12:16.736 --> 12:18.563
Although that cave
was being used

12:18.607 --> 12:20.783
by a guerrilla warlord as his
base, the last time I checked.

12:20.827 --> 12:22.437
That's where I'm going.

12:22.480 --> 12:23.917
We can save you and Nyxly.

12:25.440 --> 12:26.658
We can save everyone.

12:40.324 --> 12:42.109
You're... you're okay.

12:43.675 --> 12:44.938
Why wouldn't I be?

12:44.981 --> 12:46.853
Well, I'm not.

12:46.896 --> 12:48.855
They threw me in jail.

12:48.898 --> 12:52.946
It was just pure luck I managed
to slip away during a transfer.

12:52.989 --> 12:55.992
I sat in that cell
all night, waiting.

12:56.036 --> 13:00.562
[chuckles] Why would I
squander my hard-won power
jailbreaking you?

13:00.605 --> 13:02.259
We had a deal.

13:02.303 --> 13:05.828
I help you and you help me
get my Menagerie back.

13:05.872 --> 13:07.961
Let me help you with
something far more valuable.

13:09.614 --> 13:11.138
A lesson.

13:11.181 --> 13:13.662
Those you think are close
to you would just as soon

13:13.705 --> 13:16.230
betray you and
leave you locked away.

13:16.273 --> 13:18.101
You gave me what I needed,

13:18.145 --> 13:21.148
and now you're nothing
more to me than a gnat.

13:21.191 --> 13:25.152
And I am the bright light
that you're drawn to.

13:26.893 --> 13:28.633
That will incinerate you.

13:28.677 --> 13:30.461
But we can still
help each other.

13:34.030 --> 13:38.992
I can't focus on drawing
Mxyzptlk out with you...
buzzing around. Now, go.

13:40.689 --> 13:41.559
[buzzing]

13:50.003 --> 13:51.700
Seems like Supergirl
had an easier time

13:51.743 --> 13:53.702
getting this amulet back
from that warlord

13:53.745 --> 13:56.574
than I am just
getting it out of its case.

13:56.618 --> 13:59.012
-Maybe I can help.
-Jeez!

13:59.055 --> 14:01.666
Mxy... you know what?

14:01.710 --> 14:02.885
There we go.

14:02.929 --> 14:04.365
Sure.

14:04.408 --> 14:06.802
You can let me know
if Kelly calls again.

14:06.846 --> 14:10.066
She's been dealing with all
the fallout from the damage
Nyxly did in the Heights.

14:10.110 --> 14:12.199
No, I meant help here
with this.

14:12.242 --> 14:13.548
Without using your powers?

14:13.591 --> 14:15.724
Of course. I have...

14:15.767 --> 14:16.986
I have practical skills.

14:18.945 --> 14:20.598
Okay.

14:20.642 --> 14:23.863
Well, now that
the stone is out,

14:23.906 --> 14:26.039
any tips on how to
get the magical current

14:26.082 --> 14:27.910
to connect to the
component's electrical one?

14:29.956 --> 14:30.870
Yes.

14:33.089 --> 14:35.004
Here's the thing.

14:35.048 --> 14:37.789
I mean, you know, because magic
is just instinctive to us imps.

14:37.833 --> 14:41.445
So to explain it to a
non-Fifth-Dimensional being,

14:41.489 --> 14:45.536
it would just be like trying
to explain a spear
to a stick figure.

14:45.580 --> 14:47.451
-Why don't you try us?
-Okay.

14:52.065 --> 14:57.200
Have you tried turning it on,
turn it off,
turning it on again?

14:58.898 --> 15:01.161
You know,
I think that you should see

15:01.204 --> 15:05.165
if Brainy and Nia need help
with the DEO cuff lock.

15:05.208 --> 15:06.166
[Mr. Mxyzptlk] Amazing.

15:09.517 --> 15:10.953
Okay.

15:10.997 --> 15:13.086
-[Alex] Poor guy.
-[J'onn J'onzz] Yeah.

15:13.129 --> 15:15.958
An imp without magic
is like a rocket ship
without fuel.

15:16.002 --> 15:17.612
Impressive, but it
won't get you very far.

15:34.107 --> 15:36.109
What can I get you?

15:36.152 --> 15:38.589
Looks like you could
use something strong.

15:38.633 --> 15:40.809
Yeah... a whiskey.

15:40.852 --> 15:42.506
Neat, please.

15:42.550 --> 15:44.944
And some information, I hope.

15:44.987 --> 15:48.208
I already asked at the
bed and breakfast, but they
were decidedly unwelcoming.

15:48.251 --> 15:51.254
Dee-Dee and David? That's odd.

15:51.298 --> 15:53.735
Never met two warmer people.

15:53.778 --> 15:56.129
Well, I was hoping that
the owner of this pub

15:56.172 --> 15:58.479
could shed some light
on why they got so upset.

15:58.522 --> 16:00.176
Only if she's around,
Margaret Bishop.

16:01.656 --> 16:03.136
Most folks call me Peggy.

16:03.179 --> 16:05.007
Better that than Margaret Jr.

16:05.051 --> 16:07.009
Well, in that case, I think
our mothers were old friends.

16:07.053 --> 16:08.010
Really?

16:08.054 --> 16:09.055
What's your mom's name?

16:09.098 --> 16:10.012
Elizabeth Walsh.

16:12.667 --> 16:15.191
Elizabeth Walsh was
no friend of my mother's.

16:15.235 --> 16:19.935
And if you got any decency
at all, you'll get the hell
out of Fortune Bay.

16:19.979 --> 16:22.285
Haven't you folks
caused enough pain?

16:22.329 --> 16:23.808
I don't understand.

16:23.852 --> 16:25.332
Maybe if I could just
talk to your mother.

16:25.375 --> 16:27.856
You can't, 'cause she's dead.

16:27.899 --> 16:29.553
And your mom's
the one who killed her.

16:35.081 --> 16:36.952
My mother killed her? No.

16:36.996 --> 16:39.694
I mean, that's absurd.
She was gentle and kind.

16:39.737 --> 16:41.957
She was conniving
and opportunistic,

16:42.001 --> 16:46.135
enough to find herself
a wealthy man
to give her a new life,

16:46.179 --> 16:47.571
while my mother withered away.

16:51.445 --> 16:53.012
Okay, listen. Maybe...

16:53.925 --> 16:55.710
Maybe you're right, okay?

16:55.753 --> 16:57.364
My mother died
when I was very young,

16:57.407 --> 16:59.366
and there's so much
I don't know about her.

16:59.409 --> 17:01.933
But I came here
to find the truth,
no matter what that is.

17:01.977 --> 17:04.284
And clearly our mothers
were friends.

17:05.546 --> 17:07.243
Perhaps that changed,

17:07.287 --> 17:09.158
but there's another woman
in this picture,
Florence Abbott.

17:09.202 --> 17:10.986
And if you could just tell me
everything you know about them,

17:11.030 --> 17:12.944
I promise that you will never
have to speak to me again.

17:18.950 --> 17:20.039
They were in a coven.

17:22.476 --> 17:23.303
A coven?

17:25.131 --> 17:27.568
What, like,
cauldrons and spells?

17:27.611 --> 17:30.266
I've seen you in the news

17:30.310 --> 17:33.530
running arm-in-arm
with a bulletproof alien.

17:33.574 --> 17:35.358
But you don't believe in magic?

17:35.402 --> 17:36.533
I believe what I can see.

17:37.273 --> 17:39.580
Right, well...

17:39.623 --> 17:42.409
33 years ago, I saw your mother

17:42.452 --> 17:45.499
set fire to a shed without
lighting a single match.

17:45.542 --> 17:47.109
And my father was inside it.

17:48.458 --> 17:49.329
He died.

17:50.417 --> 17:51.418
Your mom fled.

17:51.461 --> 17:53.159
Florence vanished,

17:53.202 --> 17:55.204
leaving my mom
to deal with the fallout.

17:59.295 --> 18:01.993
Listen, this has
to be a mistake.
My mother wasn't like that.

18:02.037 --> 18:03.865
I see.

18:03.908 --> 18:06.563
You came here looking for a
fairy tale that you dreamed up.

18:06.607 --> 18:08.130
Well, your mother
wasn't the heroine.

18:09.088 --> 18:11.220
She was the villain.

18:11.264 --> 18:14.180
I get that your family
is used to leaving a trail
of bodies in their wake,

18:14.223 --> 18:16.747
but you could at least
have the decency to
leave them buried.

18:26.931 --> 18:28.411
Sprock!

18:28.455 --> 18:30.848
The nano-plating's too thin.

18:30.892 --> 18:33.286
This lock needs to be
strong enough to withstand
anything Nyxly might attempt.

18:33.329 --> 18:35.157
I mean, I can try dream energy.

18:35.201 --> 18:36.506
And I can assist!

18:38.378 --> 18:40.162
In what manner, exactly?

18:40.206 --> 18:42.469
[stammering] I could...

18:42.512 --> 18:47.126
I could... try to stabilize
some of the particle.

18:49.040 --> 18:52.043
Do I have permission to
Patrick-Swayze-in- Ghostyou?

18:52.087 --> 18:53.697
No.

18:53.741 --> 18:56.483
Look, Mxy, if you really
want to help, maybe sort wire.

18:56.526 --> 18:58.920
-Or...
-Organize the science lab.

18:58.963 --> 19:00.487
Organize the science lab.

19:00.530 --> 19:03.446
I don't know.
Just stay out of our way, okay?

19:03.490 --> 19:05.709
Sort and organize, yes.

19:05.753 --> 19:08.059
[J'onn J'onzz] Dreamer,
Supergirl is at the Fortress,
where her scanner

19:08.103 --> 19:11.237
has just picked up a spike
in Fifth Dimensional
energy downtown.

19:11.280 --> 19:12.194
[Nia] On it.

19:13.239 --> 19:14.501
We've got this.

19:19.245 --> 19:21.247
-[tires screech]
-[loud explosion]

19:22.813 --> 19:23.814
[people screaming]

19:24.772 --> 19:26.426
[siren wailing]

19:30.299 --> 19:31.953
This is all my fault.

19:31.996 --> 19:33.259
It's not.

19:33.302 --> 19:34.477
-It's...
-[snarling]

19:34.521 --> 19:35.435
A kitty?

19:40.744 --> 19:41.832
[tires screeching]

19:41.876 --> 19:42.703
I got this!

19:56.151 --> 19:58.371
Let's get you out of the city.

19:58.414 --> 20:00.242
Maybe find a nice big farm.

20:01.025 --> 20:02.592
[blowing]

20:09.817 --> 20:12.515
All right.
How are we losing to a cat?

20:12.559 --> 20:14.517
A magic cat.

20:14.561 --> 20:17.346
Fifth Dimensional beings
possess unparalleled
strength here.

20:17.390 --> 20:19.957
[Nia] So what if we
bring it somewhere
where it has less strength?

20:21.481 --> 20:22.830
I pulled Nyxly from
the dream realm.

20:22.873 --> 20:25.224
Maybe I can pull
this one the other way.

20:25.267 --> 20:28.444
You could create an
energy vortex that'd pin you
in the dream realm forever.

20:28.488 --> 20:30.229
I have to try.

20:30.272 --> 20:31.882
Everybody get back!

20:31.926 --> 20:33.319
Dreamer. Dreamer!

20:35.538 --> 20:37.323
[buzzing]

20:44.155 --> 20:45.026
Dreamer, no!

20:45.069 --> 20:46.767
[screaming]

20:47.942 --> 20:49.291
What are you doing?

20:49.335 --> 20:50.814
Something Mother taught me.

20:50.858 --> 20:52.294
[Supergirl] I'll distract
the cat!

20:52.338 --> 20:53.730
Supergirl, now!

21:17.232 --> 21:18.668
Bravo.

21:18.712 --> 21:21.976
A Khundian general
tried to capture me once.

21:22.019 --> 21:23.978
I summoned a
Kryptonite-breathing
hell dragon

21:24.021 --> 21:26.633
that turned his army to ash
before they could even think

21:26.676 --> 21:28.112
to grab their swords.

21:28.156 --> 21:30.158
[gasps]

21:30.201 --> 21:33.988
I could demonstrate,
or you could choose
to not make me angry

21:34.031 --> 21:35.381
and just give me what I want.

21:36.817 --> 21:38.209
Mxyzptlk.

21:38.253 --> 21:40.864
Smidt Park, two hours.

21:45.652 --> 21:47.697
-Are you okay?
-[gasping]

21:56.140 --> 21:58.055
[cellphone ringing]

21:59.579 --> 22:01.276
Andrea, I was just
gonna call you.

22:01.320 --> 22:03.322
Well, I hope it was to pencil
some thank you drinks

22:03.365 --> 22:05.628
when you get back
because I found the woman
in your photo.

22:05.672 --> 22:07.717
Florence Abbott.

22:07.761 --> 22:10.111
It took some digging.
She gives new meaning
to "off the grid."

22:10.154 --> 22:13.723
But rumor is, she disappeared
because she was connected

22:13.767 --> 22:17.074
to a suspicious death,
Margaret Bishop's husband.

22:17.118 --> 22:20.077
Listen, I appreciate the help,
but I'm heading home.

22:20.121 --> 22:21.949
What? So soon?

22:21.992 --> 22:24.517
This trip was a mistake.
I'm done.

22:24.560 --> 22:27.389
Lena, if you found
some messy family history,

22:27.433 --> 22:29.043
you know that's nothing new.

22:29.086 --> 22:31.219
Well, I would have
expected it from the Luthors,

22:31.262 --> 22:33.700
but I should have known
my mother's side
would have been just as awful.

22:33.743 --> 22:34.918
But what did you find out?

22:37.007 --> 22:39.401
It's hearsay,
but I've heard enough.

22:39.445 --> 22:41.185
I just don't want
to put myself through it.

22:41.229 --> 22:43.100
This has been a gap
in your life for so long,

22:43.144 --> 22:45.407
and this is your chance
to fill in the blanks.

22:45.451 --> 22:49.063
The unknown is always
scarier than the truth.

22:49.106 --> 22:50.804
Unless the truth really is bad.

22:50.847 --> 22:54.285
You can't deal with the past
until you face it.

22:54.329 --> 22:56.244
I emailed you
the files on Florence.

22:56.287 --> 22:59.421
Just take a look at them.
At least think about it.

22:59.465 --> 23:00.901
Information doesn't
hurt people.

23:02.293 --> 23:03.164
Secrets do.

23:05.166 --> 23:07.429
Okay. Thank you.

23:11.955 --> 23:16.830
Nia, trying to pull
that cat thing into
the dream realm was rash.

23:16.873 --> 23:18.397
I almost had it.

23:18.440 --> 23:20.660
-We could have lost you.
-Does it matter?

23:20.703 --> 23:23.532
I have to stop Nyxly.
I have to fix this.

23:23.576 --> 23:26.753
You won't fix
anything by dying.

23:26.796 --> 23:28.145
Your guilt is
eating away at you.

23:28.189 --> 23:30.452
It's making you
act irrationally.

23:30.496 --> 23:31.671
You have to tell Kara.

23:31.714 --> 23:32.628
[Kara] Tell me what?

23:34.804 --> 23:36.980
That I'm sorry
I screwed up today.

23:38.460 --> 23:39.940
Don't be sorry.
It's not your fault.

23:39.983 --> 23:41.332
If anything, it's my fault.

23:41.376 --> 23:43.552
Okay. It's nobody's fault.
Now...

23:43.596 --> 23:46.076
We have two hours to be ready
to depower Nyxly and...

23:46.120 --> 23:49.645
Avoid... cat-tastrophe.

23:49.689 --> 23:51.342
[Alex] Okay.
Why are you so chipper?

23:51.386 --> 23:53.388
We still don't have
a working anti-magic cuff yet.

23:53.432 --> 23:55.129
Nor a way to get it onto Nyxly.

23:55.172 --> 23:56.478
Not a problem.

23:56.522 --> 23:57.479
I'll do it.

23:59.525 --> 24:00.613
And so will I.

24:03.093 --> 24:05.139
Mxy, what did you do?

24:05.182 --> 24:09.360
While I was tidying up,
I found this handy
little copy machine.

24:09.404 --> 24:11.058
We want to get Nyxly
with her guard down,

24:11.101 --> 24:13.234
why not give the princess
what she wants?

24:13.277 --> 24:14.191
[clone] Me.

24:16.150 --> 24:19.414
Okay, so you're thinking
that we use the other you

24:19.458 --> 24:22.112
to act like a Trojan horse
to get close to Nyxly?

24:22.156 --> 24:24.854
That... That's not bad, Mxy.

24:24.898 --> 24:26.290
[J'onn J'onzz]
We just have to get the copy

24:26.334 --> 24:27.683
close enough to
put the cuff on Nyxly

24:27.727 --> 24:29.903
before she
realizes it's a fake.

24:29.946 --> 24:33.254
[clone] Ergo, I will engage
her in conversation
until... [repeating]

24:36.692 --> 24:39.042
Ah. Oh... That felt yucky.

24:44.744 --> 24:48.704
Fifth Dimensional energy
must destabilize
the copying format,

24:48.748 --> 24:51.185
causing the duplicate
to reintegrate
with its progenitor.

24:51.228 --> 24:54.188
Okay, let's just
get back to work on
re-engineering that cuff.

24:54.231 --> 24:58.192
Yeah, it was a nice try,
at least. Just sorry
I got us into this mess.

25:15.209 --> 25:16.079
Hey.

25:18.473 --> 25:21.215
Kara, I can't stand by
and watch you
blame yourself for this.

25:21.258 --> 25:22.085
How can I not?

25:23.565 --> 25:26.176
Nyxly escaped
because of my rescue.

25:26.220 --> 25:28.135
Even if I hadn't
made enemies with...

25:28.178 --> 25:29.789
I'm the one
who let Nyxly escape.

25:34.968 --> 25:39.886
When she left the Phantom Zone,
she got trapped
in the dream realm.

25:39.929 --> 25:45.805
I don't know how, but she found
me and offered me a deal.

25:45.848 --> 25:50.723
I didn't know who she was,
but she said that
if I freed her,

25:50.766 --> 25:53.116
she would bring my mom back
for one day.

25:53.160 --> 25:54.117
Damn.

25:55.554 --> 25:56.380
So I did.

25:58.078 --> 26:02.691
So, it's not your fault,
it's mine.

26:02.735 --> 26:08.088
And I know it was so selfish
and you can't forgive me,

26:08.131 --> 26:10.612
-but Nyxly is...
-A master manipulator.

26:12.614 --> 26:13.615
She fooled me, too.

26:17.097 --> 26:21.797
-You don't hate me?
-Hate? Nia, you made a mistake.

26:23.016 --> 26:24.757
A big one. Yeah.

26:24.800 --> 26:25.845
But so have I.

26:26.585 --> 26:28.456
We all have.

26:28.499 --> 26:30.937
What's important right now is
that we learn from our mistakes

26:30.980 --> 26:32.678
and use it to
stop her together.

26:35.115 --> 26:38.945
I just wish there was
some way I could fix this.

26:38.988 --> 26:41.730
It's too bad I can't dream up
a better Mxy clone
or something.

26:43.340 --> 26:46.343
Or something... I have an idea.

27:14.154 --> 27:14.981
[thuds]

27:23.990 --> 27:26.775
[swishing]

27:40.702 --> 27:41.616
Who are you?

27:42.443 --> 27:43.836
I mean you no harm.

27:45.272 --> 27:46.665
My God!

27:48.014 --> 27:51.017
-You look just like...
-Elizabeth Walsh.

27:51.060 --> 27:52.061
I'm her daughter.

27:54.673 --> 27:57.371
-I came here to...
-I know why you're here.

27:57.414 --> 27:59.852
I've been waiting
for this day a long time.

28:07.947 --> 28:10.645
Your mother visits me
in my dreams, you know.

28:10.689 --> 28:13.300
She's told me all about you.

28:13.343 --> 28:15.737
Said you'd show up here
one day looking for answers.

28:16.695 --> 28:18.740
Warned me to be precise.

28:19.959 --> 28:22.352
She says you're a scientist.

28:22.396 --> 28:24.746
[Lena] Why, it doesn't take
a ghost for you to know that.

28:24.790 --> 28:27.009
A simple Google search
would suffice.

28:27.053 --> 28:28.576
I don't trust computers.

28:28.619 --> 28:30.621
I get my information
from the source.

28:32.188 --> 28:33.102
Sit.

28:42.590 --> 28:43.765
I need a drop of your blood.

28:44.679 --> 28:46.855
[scoffs]

28:46.899 --> 28:50.337
Look, it's like you said,
I'm a scientist and I don't
want to waste your time,

28:50.380 --> 28:52.252
but I don't believe in magic.

28:52.295 --> 28:53.949
Let the truth persuade you.

29:15.841 --> 29:18.626
[Florence] I come from
a long line of witches.

29:18.669 --> 29:20.802
Most people shunned me for it.

29:20.846 --> 29:24.110
But your mother and Margaret,
they had the gift, too.

29:24.153 --> 29:26.634
They sought me out.

29:26.677 --> 29:29.855
Witchcraft requires
a deep knowledge of the earth.

29:29.898 --> 29:35.295
Every leaf, seed, twig
is as alive and unique
as you or me.

29:35.338 --> 29:40.082
And learning the language of
nature takes patience, rigor.

29:40.126 --> 29:43.651
And your mom
committed herself to the work,

29:43.694 --> 29:45.305
like you, with your science.

29:47.394 --> 29:50.832
Drawing power from nature,
that part can't be taught.

29:50.876 --> 29:56.838
It takes a spark, and your
mother's spark was powerful.

29:56.882 --> 30:00.059
We three worked
quietly, content,

30:00.102 --> 30:04.585
until Margaret started
showing up with bruises
on her face, a broken arm.

30:04.628 --> 30:08.023
Her husband Tommy was
well liked. No one believed
he beat his wife.

30:10.112 --> 30:13.202
So... we took matters
into our own hands.

30:15.726 --> 30:21.384
The truth is,
we only meant to scare,
but the magic got away from us.

30:21.428 --> 30:22.472
[screams]

30:24.213 --> 30:25.606
[whimpering]

30:25.649 --> 30:28.870
There's no denying
that fire was unnatural.

30:28.914 --> 30:31.220
The town turned on us,
threatened to stone us.

30:32.787 --> 30:35.181
They left Margaret
to her shame.

30:35.224 --> 30:38.184
With my family history,
they hunted me, wanted me dead.

30:39.228 --> 30:40.447
I had to hide.

30:42.928 --> 30:43.885
And my mother?

30:43.929 --> 30:46.018
She escaped to the States.

30:46.061 --> 30:51.327
And Lizzie called me once,
said she'd taken up
with Lionel Luthor.

30:51.371 --> 30:55.070
Said she was living
under his control because
she no longer trusted herself.

30:56.245 --> 30:58.682
Lena...

30:58.726 --> 31:01.990
your mother wants you to know
she was only trying
to protect Margaret.

31:02.861 --> 31:04.906
Her heart was pure.

31:04.950 --> 31:06.603
She didn't realize
her own power.

31:09.780 --> 31:11.565
Thank you for telling me this.

31:11.608 --> 31:15.612
Believe me when I tell you,
your mother sees you.

31:17.440 --> 31:19.616
And she's very proud
of the woman you are.

31:32.325 --> 31:34.370
Our anti-magic cuff
is complete.

31:34.414 --> 31:37.069
Now for a plan
to get it onto Nyxly
in less than an hour to go.

31:37.112 --> 31:39.201
[Kara] We've got that covered.

31:39.245 --> 31:41.943
Brainy, we're gonna need
to borrow your image inducer.

31:41.987 --> 31:44.598
Our new Mxy decoy
is going to be me.

31:44.641 --> 31:48.515
-We'll go to Smidt Park...
-Alone, so we
don't spook Nyxly.

31:48.558 --> 31:51.083
And I'll get the cuff on her.

31:51.126 --> 31:54.173
Looks like you were
right on track with
that whole copy idea, Mxy.

31:54.216 --> 31:55.043
Thank you.

31:58.307 --> 32:00.614
[swishing]

32:00.657 --> 32:03.443
-You sure about this?
-We are.

32:03.486 --> 32:05.967
Don't worry.
I won't do anything rash.

32:09.666 --> 32:11.973
[Mr. Mxyzptlk] Ms. Nal,
while I know it's
going to be challenging,

32:12.017 --> 32:18.110
I have complete faith
in your ability to replicate
my... je ne sais quoi.

32:18.153 --> 32:19.502
[J'onn J'onzz] Better her
than me.

32:29.208 --> 32:30.165
[both] What could go wrong?

32:38.478 --> 32:39.958
Nyxly.

32:41.133 --> 32:42.308
Nyxly?

32:43.396 --> 32:44.223
[swishes]

32:45.398 --> 32:47.008
It's about time.

32:49.358 --> 32:51.491
Wait, wait.

32:51.534 --> 32:54.450
Mxy is giving himself up.

32:54.494 --> 32:57.323
The least you can do
is let him get in
the crystal himself.

32:57.366 --> 32:59.760
[Nyxly chuckles] Really?

32:59.803 --> 33:02.806
That would be more compassion
than any imp ever showed me.

33:02.850 --> 33:04.504
And for that, I am sorry.

33:06.375 --> 33:07.724
Fine. Here you go.

33:19.301 --> 33:21.390
Sprock.

33:21.434 --> 33:23.697
The crystal's magic
is interrupting the image
inducer's optic drive.

33:28.789 --> 33:29.877
What is this?

33:29.920 --> 33:30.878
No.

33:32.227 --> 33:33.315
I'll get the projector.

33:34.099 --> 33:35.013
Stay put.

33:36.101 --> 33:37.363
Please don't touch anything.

33:40.235 --> 33:42.411
I told you not
to make me angry.

33:42.455 --> 33:43.891
And now you've
gone and done it.

33:46.111 --> 33:48.635
Wait. Stop, everyone.
We don't have to do this.

33:48.678 --> 33:50.158
We can fix this.

33:50.202 --> 33:53.988
If you won't deliver Mxy,
I'll make him come to me.

33:57.861 --> 34:02.083
Do you remember that story
I told you about
the Khundian general?

34:08.263 --> 34:09.221
[bird screeching]

34:10.526 --> 34:11.832
No.

34:11.875 --> 34:12.876
No, no.

34:12.920 --> 34:14.661
[echoing] Mxy.

34:16.141 --> 34:17.751
Mxy.

34:17.794 --> 34:19.187
-Summon him.
-Never.

34:19.231 --> 34:22.234
You really think
that imp is worth dying for?

34:22.277 --> 34:23.539
[Brainy] Imps can't kill.

34:24.932 --> 34:27.326
I'm not going to kill you.

34:27.369 --> 34:29.241
-[whistles]
-[roaring]

34:32.070 --> 34:33.636
He is.

34:33.680 --> 34:35.377
My dream power's not working.

34:35.421 --> 34:37.031
Neither is my
Hand of the soldier.

34:37.075 --> 34:38.467
Can you reach her psychically?

34:38.511 --> 34:39.468
Not so far.

34:42.428 --> 34:44.908
Let me tell you
who you're protecting.

34:44.952 --> 34:49.043
Three hundred years ago,
an imp I thought was my friend

34:49.087 --> 34:50.740
assured me

34:50.784 --> 34:54.222
he supported overthrowing
my insane father.

34:54.266 --> 34:58.008
That imp was Mr. Mxyzptlk.

34:58.052 --> 34:59.488
I know you're watching.

35:00.489 --> 35:03.144
After our plot failed,

35:03.188 --> 35:06.104
I was certain my ally
would come to my defense.

35:07.714 --> 35:10.847
But Mxy saw which way
the wind was blowing

35:10.891 --> 35:14.373
and crawled back into the ranks
of the patriarchy.

35:14.416 --> 35:18.420
Mxy has already proven
he only cares about himself.

35:18.464 --> 35:19.552
[swishing]

35:21.554 --> 35:25.166
He wouldn't do
the same for you,
suffer total annihilation.

35:26.211 --> 35:27.299
[screeching]

35:33.218 --> 35:34.654
[screaming]

35:35.481 --> 35:36.656
[roars]

35:37.178 --> 35:38.092
No!

35:42.662 --> 35:44.403
[Mr. Mxyzptlk] Show's over.

35:44.446 --> 35:46.100
Everything's back as it was.

35:46.144 --> 35:47.493
Mxy, you can't be here.

35:47.536 --> 35:51.149
-But he is.
-And I deserve to be.

35:51.192 --> 35:53.673
You see, when you live
a life of magical privilege,

35:53.716 --> 35:55.501
making everything happen
with a snap,

35:55.544 --> 35:58.895
you don't really
understand consequences.

35:58.939 --> 36:01.507
I could have stood up for Nyxly
when I had the chance.

36:01.550 --> 36:02.725
Could have helped save her.

36:03.900 --> 36:05.554
I can still save you.

36:05.598 --> 36:07.339
Too little, too late.

36:09.036 --> 36:10.646
[Kara] No, hang on, hang on.

36:10.690 --> 36:13.127
Nyxly...

36:13.171 --> 36:18.567
I know you have the power
to destroy us, but you also
haven't killed a single soul.

36:20.178 --> 36:23.050
No matter what you say,
you are not a murderer.

36:23.093 --> 36:25.835
Mmm... Did you not
see the hell dragon?

36:25.879 --> 36:28.490
That was just
you playing with magic.

36:28.534 --> 36:31.711
You're angry
and you have every right to be.

36:31.754 --> 36:34.148
I'm angry for you.

36:34.192 --> 36:36.977
But dedicating your life
to destruction and revenge,

36:37.020 --> 36:40.154
that is not going to
make up for the things
that happened to you.

36:40.198 --> 36:41.329
You don't need that crystal.

36:42.722 --> 36:45.072
We don't need these weapons.

36:45.115 --> 36:46.943
We can be stronger together.

36:56.866 --> 36:57.693
Nah.

37:01.958 --> 37:03.046
[buzzing]

37:15.363 --> 37:18.714
[Kara] Nyxly, I'm sorry.
You gave me no choice.

37:21.456 --> 37:23.980
[Mr. Mxyzptlk] Supergirl, no!
I've got this!

37:24.024 --> 37:25.243
Stronger together?

37:25.286 --> 37:26.156
[Mr. Mxyzptlk snaps finger]

37:43.086 --> 37:45.872
I haven't been able to locate
a signal from Mxy or Nyxly

37:45.915 --> 37:47.961
since they both disappeared.

37:48.004 --> 37:50.964
Mxy told me over and over again
how far gone Nyxly was

37:51.007 --> 37:53.227
and I refused to listen.

37:53.271 --> 37:56.970
He gave himself up
so I didn't have to use
the Phantom Zone protector.

37:57.013 --> 37:59.799
Turns out, using it
was the right call all along.

37:59.842 --> 38:03.455
Well, you just held hope
that you could appeal
to the good in someone.

38:03.498 --> 38:07.807
It didn't work this time,
but you were not wrong to try.

38:07.850 --> 38:10.288
Still... we lost Mxy.

38:11.593 --> 38:13.160
That doesn't mean
we can't save him.

38:14.553 --> 38:16.598
I dreamt that Mxy died,

38:16.642 --> 38:19.819
but if what he says is true,
then he's still alive
in that crystal.

38:19.862 --> 38:21.647
And thanks to him,
Nyxly is depowered,

38:21.690 --> 38:23.039
and we know what she's after.

38:25.868 --> 38:28.044
We all make mistakes, right?

38:28.088 --> 38:31.352
So all we can do now
is learn from them
and try to move forward.

38:35.922 --> 38:36.836
Let's go get him.

38:44.844 --> 38:46.976
This one's my favorite.

38:47.020 --> 38:49.370
It was rare to catch Elizabeth
in front of the lens,

38:49.414 --> 38:52.286
so enchanted with
the world around her,
she often forgot herself.

38:53.505 --> 38:55.855
Have you shown this to Peggy?

38:55.898 --> 38:58.466
I mean, it could
bring her some peace.
She deserves that much.

38:58.510 --> 39:01.339
By the time I
worked up the courage,
she wouldn't hear it.

39:01.382 --> 39:04.516
But your stone here
could show her the truth.

39:04.559 --> 39:07.693
Got me to question my cynicism.
I'm sure it can reach anyone.

39:07.736 --> 39:10.086
For Peggy, Elizabeth and I
will always be the reason

39:10.130 --> 39:12.219
her parents are dead.

39:12.262 --> 39:14.569
Magic can do
a great deal of good,
but it cannot reach everyone.

39:15.831 --> 39:17.920
For you, it's different.

39:17.964 --> 39:19.182
You have your mother's gift.

39:20.227 --> 39:23.056
No, that's absurd.

39:23.099 --> 39:25.754
Look, I said,
I questioned my cynicism.
I didn't say I dropped it.

39:27.234 --> 39:29.323
Florence, I believe
what you showed me,

39:29.367 --> 39:31.456
but I also believe that
there's a scientific
explanation for it.

39:31.499 --> 39:33.022
I just need to find it.

39:33.066 --> 39:34.981
The laws of witchcraft
work on a different plane

39:35.024 --> 39:37.113
than the laws of science.

39:37.157 --> 39:41.596
Like two parallel lines,
you'll never find a point
where they intersect.

39:41.640 --> 39:43.468
You would not have been able
to use the stone

39:43.511 --> 39:45.470
if you didn't have
the spark, Lena.

39:45.513 --> 39:49.082
You have the gift, should you
choose to embrace it.

39:57.090 --> 39:58.091
You saved me.

39:58.700 --> 39:59.571
Why?

40:00.485 --> 40:03.531
I saw your powers.

40:03.575 --> 40:06.578
I thought you were the answer
to getting my old life back.

40:06.621 --> 40:10.451
But what you did today,
that cat was incredible.

40:10.495 --> 40:14.150
You brought Supergirl
to her knees
with a snap of your fingers.

40:14.194 --> 40:17.937
You could do things
I never thought possible.

40:17.980 --> 40:23.986
And it made me realize
you can do more
than give me my old life back.

40:25.335 --> 40:28.817
You can give me a better one.

40:28.861 --> 40:31.777
Why would I agree to being
your personal wishing well?

40:31.820 --> 40:33.605
Hmm?

40:33.648 --> 40:38.305
I know what it's like to be
shackled, and I can help you.

40:40.002 --> 40:42.091
Uh-uh...

40:43.702 --> 40:45.791
I suppose two
are better than one.

40:46.531 --> 40:48.358
All right.

40:48.402 --> 40:53.363
If you survive what's next,
any life you desire is yours.

40:56.192 --> 40:57.846
So be it.

40:57.890 --> 41:03.199
But first, you need to help me
find the totem of courage

41:03.243 --> 41:07.508
because when you control
courage, you control fear.

41:11.643 --> 41:13.122
[gasps]

41:14.080 --> 41:15.516
Nia.

41:15.560 --> 41:17.997
-Was it a dream?
-I saw Nyxly.

41:18.040 --> 41:21.304
She's with Mitch.
She's depowered,
but her crystal isn't.

41:21.348 --> 41:22.828
She's already
looking for the totems.

41:22.871 --> 41:25.134
Then we need to
find them first.

41:25.178 --> 41:27.659
And this time,
no holding back.
