00:34.664 --> 00:38.744
- Stan, quit spying on the neighbours.
- Today's the day, Francine.

00:38.835 --> 00:43.792
Today I will finally beat
that smug bastard Chuck White to church.

00:43.881 --> 00:47.166
Look at him, zipping up his fly
like he owns the place.

00:47.259 --> 00:49.631
Well, today I get the shady parking spot.

00:49.720 --> 00:54.346
Chuck still needs a tie. He's a double-Windsor
man, so we have a good two minutes to...

00:54.432 --> 00:57.386
Good God! A clip-on! Go, go, go!

00:57.477 --> 00:58.887
- Wait! My bra!
- No time!

00:58.978 --> 01:01.516
Keep your arms crossed
and Jesus won't see 'em!

01:02.982 --> 01:06.682
- Stan, you just killed a pigeon.
- No, I didn't.

01:09.112 --> 01:14.319
Stan, slow down. Is beating Chuck White
so important you'd put our lives at risk?

01:14.409 --> 01:16.401
Absolutely.

01:16.494 --> 01:18.902
- You ran through a crosswalk!
- No, I didn't.

01:19.414 --> 01:21.287
Hello, Mr Perkins.

01:23.417 --> 01:27.995
Spray him. Spray him a little.
That'll loosen him up.

01:28.922 --> 01:30.001
Thank you!

01:33.802 --> 01:36.672
Dammit! Every freakin' time!

01:36.763 --> 01:39.882
Looks like you're parking in the sun again.

01:42.977 --> 01:47.140
Remember our agreement that we could
each do one person and it wouldn't count?

01:47.231 --> 01:50.481
- Yes. You picked Susan Sarandon.
- I've changed my mind.

01:50.567 --> 01:54.944
I want my one free kill to be Chuck White.
Yours can still be George Clooney.

01:55.030 --> 01:56.987
Clooney, you smug bastard.

01:57.073 --> 02:00.822
Stop playing basketball
and get married like the rest of us!

02:00.910 --> 02:05.370
And so, in closing, remember Galatians 5:14.

02:05.456 --> 02:08.622
"Love thy neighbour as thyself."

02:08.709 --> 02:13.252
You know, people often ask me what
that means. Seriously. Can you believe it?

02:13.338 --> 02:18.415
Morons! Anyway, the most important lesson
God wants you to learn is...

02:20.136 --> 02:23.552
Oh! Gotta go! God is good, Devil's bad.

02:23.639 --> 02:26.474
Deacon, you wanna slap a bow
on this puppy?

02:26.559 --> 02:28.267
Parishioner announcements:

02:28.352 --> 02:33.773
Stan Smith's daughter Hayley has made
the dean's list at Groff Community College.

02:33.857 --> 02:36.727
Congrats, Hayley.
What could outshine that?

02:36.818 --> 02:42.571
How about Chuck White's daughter Betsy
qualifying for the Olympic gymnastics team?

02:48.913 --> 02:51.617
Jesus, Joseph and Mary Lou Retton!

02:55.961 --> 02:58.796
OK, I'll be taking
the first Communion this morning.

02:58.880 --> 03:04.585
For maximum salvation,
make sure you chew the Host completely...

03:07.597 --> 03:09.922
That's odd.

03:10.015 --> 03:12.008
I can't believe he choked to death.

03:12.101 --> 03:15.683
Terry always nagged him not to talk
with his mouth full of saviour.

03:15.771 --> 03:18.475
- I nagged him? Oh, that's nice.
- You nagged him.

03:18.565 --> 03:20.807
I told you it was not appropriate!

03:20.900 --> 03:22.976
Then I guess we need a new deacon.

03:24.445 --> 03:26.853
Long hours, no pay, whiny churchgoers.

03:26.948 --> 03:30.399
- You'd have to be an idiot to volunteer.
- I volunteer to be deacon.

03:30.493 --> 03:32.699
- Me too!
- Great.

03:32.786 --> 03:34.909
Now we need an election next Sunday.

03:34.997 --> 03:37.570
Guess I won't be fishing then either.

03:37.666 --> 03:41.248
Shut the hell up, Marty!
I need this trip more than you do!

03:44.297 --> 03:49.291
Gary... When I'm gone,
I want you to ride my bicycle.

03:49.385 --> 03:54.177
You're watching Delta Burke in the
Lifetime original movie "A Cyst for Amelia".

03:55.766 --> 03:57.842
Why so sensitive all of a sudden?

03:57.935 --> 04:02.929
I'm going through my reproductive cycle.
It's complicated. I'll draw you a diagram.

04:03.023 --> 04:06.438
Every six years,
my glaxins shoot up into my fompairs,

04:06.526 --> 04:11.104
causing me to lactate a viscous milky mucus.

04:11.197 --> 04:15.028
<i>Your insides sicken me!</i>
I'll be in mein crapper.

04:16.577 --> 04:19.197
<i>I'm always in mein crapper.</i>

04:19.288 --> 04:21.861
- Hello. How was church?
- Waste of time.

04:21.957 --> 04:24.708
- Love has a face.
- Stan, what's the big deal?

04:24.793 --> 04:29.620
Chuck White offered to host the pot-luck
wake while I was in the bathroom!

04:29.714 --> 04:31.872
Damn my tiny, girlish bladder!

04:31.966 --> 04:35.132
If we don't bring the perfect dish,
I might as well withdraw!

04:35.219 --> 04:38.801
You don't care about being deacon!
You just wanna beat Chuck White.

04:38.889 --> 04:41.724
- Why do you hate him so much?
- Look at his life.

04:41.808 --> 04:45.640
He's got a bigger paycheck, a nicer house,
a better wife, better kids...

04:45.729 --> 04:49.892
- That's incredibly hurtful!
- That's why I wanna shove it in his face!

04:49.983 --> 04:54.443
OK. If it means that much to you,
I guess we can bring chips and dip.

04:54.528 --> 04:57.862
Chips and dip? I tell you what, Francine.

04:57.948 --> 05:01.531
Why don't you take this broom here,
I'll bend over and grab my ankles,

05:01.618 --> 05:05.201
you lube up the handle real good,
and just sweep me out the door.

05:05.288 --> 05:09.072
Cos that's what'll happen to my chances
at deacon if we take chips and dip!

05:09.167 --> 05:12.452
- I could make potato salad.
- Potato salad?

05:12.545 --> 05:17.835
Unadventurous, but it gets the job done.
That reminds me. Let's have sex tonight.

05:20.386 --> 05:22.544
<i>Oh, Cagney & Lacey!</i>

05:22.638 --> 05:26.552
You were so much more
than thick ankles and careful police work.

05:26.641 --> 05:29.595
- How's the potato salad?
- Delicious.

05:30.603 --> 05:38.064
You know what's even more delicious? You
have just eaten all of Francine's potato salad!

05:39.195 --> 05:43.192
You set me up, Klaus!
Why would you do something so awful?

05:43.282 --> 05:45.607
I'm German. It's what we do.

05:47.244 --> 05:49.995
Add chopped celery, four eggs.

05:50.080 --> 05:52.914
Just need to add mayonnaise, and...

05:52.999 --> 05:54.991
Oh, God! We're out of mayo!

05:55.084 --> 05:58.583
But if I don't make more potato salad,
Stan's gonna rip my head off!

05:58.671 --> 06:01.790
When he does, keep blinking your eyes
as long as you can.

06:01.882 --> 06:04.207
I have a theory to test.

06:05.677 --> 06:08.215
Smith. Glad you made it.

06:08.305 --> 06:11.970
Potato salad.
Oh, that is just adorable!

06:12.058 --> 06:16.008
- Chuck, Christie. Nice house.
- Smith, you live in a house.

06:16.104 --> 06:20.433
This is a manor.
So you'd better mind yours!

06:21.317 --> 06:23.558
No.

06:24.862 --> 06:29.440
Hi, Betsy. Steve Smith.
We were in first grade together,

06:29.533 --> 06:33.364
- before you left for gymnastics camp.
- Steve. Great to see you again.

06:33.453 --> 06:36.026
Are you still into
the juice and crackers thing?

06:36.122 --> 06:41.958
No. I'm on an ultra-strict diet. I can only eat
what Coach Béla Kàrolyi approves.

06:42.044 --> 06:44.286
Lemon wedge?

06:44.380 --> 06:49.586
Fatty wants a lemon wedge?
Here's your precious lemon wedge!

06:51.261 --> 06:53.337
You boys having fun? Good.

06:53.430 --> 06:56.383
You know, I'd do anything
to get elected deacon.

06:56.474 --> 07:01.634
- Well, I'm sure the best man will...
- Anything.

07:01.729 --> 07:05.940
Oh, my God! Have you tasted
this potato salad? It is amazing!

07:06.025 --> 07:09.939
<i>- It is?</i>
- It blows Christie's nachos out of the agua!

07:11.279 --> 07:13.770
Whoever made it,
her husband should be deacon.

07:13.865 --> 07:15.988
That's me! Stan Smith for deacon.

07:16.075 --> 07:18.946
Deacon Stan, Jesus Man.

07:21.080 --> 07:23.322
Stan, that was not my potato salad.

07:23.416 --> 07:26.701
There was an ingredient in there
I can't put my finger on.

07:26.794 --> 07:29.794
Oh, God! The guilt!
I can't take the guilt any more!

07:29.880 --> 07:33.924
You know how I'm going through
my reproductive time. I have a diagram...

07:34.009 --> 07:38.801
- Yes, yes. We've all seen the diagram.
- Last night, I ate all your potato salad,

07:38.888 --> 07:43.051
and I tried to make more,
but there was no mayo, so instead I used...

07:43.142 --> 07:45.218
Well, pull my finger.

07:46.478 --> 07:48.554
Mystery solved.

07:50.065 --> 07:52.900
I don't get it.
So what's the secret ingredient?

07:54.736 --> 07:57.737
We served alien breast milk to our church!

07:57.822 --> 08:01.238
If anyone finds out, Chuck'll
slaughter me in the race for deacon.

08:01.326 --> 08:04.694
So I've called in a specialist
to help me with my campaign.

08:04.787 --> 08:07.990
Did it suddenly get cold in here?

08:08.082 --> 08:10.489
Francine, meet Karl Rove.

08:11.877 --> 08:14.794
Let's get started.

08:16.256 --> 08:21.083
Wait. I know you. You're the amoral
puppet master behind George W Bush!

08:21.177 --> 08:25.044
Thank you. Now,
if you're going to beat Chuck White,

08:25.139 --> 08:28.804
we have to take inventory of your assets.
The boy.

08:28.893 --> 08:32.557
You can count on Steve.
He's a loyal soldier, Karl Rove.

08:33.855 --> 08:37.307
I could do even more.
Betsy White said she's learning CPR.

08:37.400 --> 08:40.354
Could put Chuck ahead
with undecided choking voters.

08:40.445 --> 08:44.442
- Put him in the girl's class.
- Yes! Thank you, Satan.

08:44.532 --> 08:47.153
Next, the black sheep.

08:47.243 --> 08:49.994
That was just a fraternity prank!
I was blindfolded!

08:50.079 --> 08:53.329
- The peer pressure was enormous!
- I mean your daughter.

08:53.415 --> 08:57.958
She could sink this whole election.
I mean, look at her. She's clearly gay.

08:58.044 --> 09:00.749
- I'm not gay.
- Whatever you say, butch.

09:00.839 --> 09:05.880
Now, Francine. Your potato salad
is the key to Stan's victory.

09:05.968 --> 09:08.175
- It is?
- The masses love it.

09:08.262 --> 09:10.967
As long as you can keep
feeding it to them, we win.

09:11.056 --> 09:16.395
But what if I told you it contained
a horrible ingredient? An unholy ingredient?

09:16.478 --> 09:18.933
Unholy, you say?

09:22.776 --> 09:25.313
Anything else?

09:25.403 --> 09:28.190
Where does your food go?

09:30.783 --> 09:34.317
I don't care what this quiz says.
I am a flirt!

09:34.411 --> 09:37.910
Here. Empty your mammary glands
into this pail until it's full.

09:37.998 --> 09:40.619
No, I don't think so. I'm not in the mood.

09:40.709 --> 09:44.540
- How about now?
- Oh, you're a beast. A beast!

09:45.630 --> 09:49.674
Oh, for God's sake!
Roger, I'm sorry if I was insensitive, all right?

09:49.759 --> 09:52.166
You're going through an emotional time.

09:52.261 --> 09:54.300
I am!

09:54.388 --> 09:57.923
There, there. It's going to be OK.

09:58.016 --> 10:02.761
- You look very pretty today.
- Really? I'm trying a new rejuvenating mask.

10:02.854 --> 10:05.724
Well, whatever you're doing, it's working.

10:05.815 --> 10:07.891
May I?

10:15.616 --> 10:18.107
Eat up, everybody. Yeah, stuff your faces.

10:18.202 --> 10:21.985
Stan, honey. We've run out of potato salad.

10:22.080 --> 10:25.531
Oh, my God! No! Wait! Wait!

10:25.625 --> 10:31.129
I've got a stick of gum! Who likes Big Red,
huh? Who likes Big Red, huh? Big...

10:31.214 --> 10:35.425
What is wrong with you?
We cannot run out of potato salad again,

10:35.509 --> 10:38.426
or we will lose on Sunday.

10:39.972 --> 10:42.723
Damn! My car's been towed.

10:46.978 --> 10:50.513
- Take it easy, Old MacDonald!
- There's barely any milk in these.

10:50.606 --> 10:52.848
He secretes more after he eats.

10:52.942 --> 10:58.980
Stuff his face, and the milk will flow like the
lies from my drunken mother's filthy mouth!

10:59.073 --> 11:04.493
Oh, no. Please, don't.
It's almost swimsuit season. I just...

11:07.455 --> 11:09.697
Why, Klaus? Why?

11:09.791 --> 11:11.748
<i>Ja, still German.</i>

11:12.460 --> 11:16.872
Thanks for walking me home from CPR class,
Steve. Can I tell you something personal?

11:16.964 --> 11:20.547
I told you about having to leave
my underwear at Disneyland.

11:20.634 --> 11:25.130
I'm only doing gymnastics because
my parents make me. All I do is practise.

11:25.222 --> 11:28.175
In fact, you're the only boy
I ever spent any time with.

11:28.266 --> 11:30.389
I like those odds.

11:31.436 --> 11:33.262
Wow! Second base.

11:33.354 --> 11:36.355
Betsy White, what did I tell you
about hand-holding?

11:36.440 --> 11:39.856
It leads to kissing,
which can get you pregnant.

11:39.944 --> 11:43.063
I touched her hand.
Her hand touched her boob.

11:43.155 --> 11:47.698
By the transitive property, I got some boob.
Algebra's awesome!

11:50.829 --> 11:54.363
Oh, sorry, Roger.
It's time to supersize you.

11:57.793 --> 12:01.458
Stan, look what we're doing to Roger.
We have to stop this.

12:01.547 --> 12:04.548
We can't stop.
The election is tomorrow. Roger's fine.

12:04.633 --> 12:08.333
Kill... me.

12:08.428 --> 12:12.378
Then what about me? I've been
up for days making potato salad.

12:12.474 --> 12:17.431
- I can't think straight! My back is killing me!
- I know how hard you've been working.

12:17.520 --> 12:20.058
So I got you some help
from a Taiwanese sweatshop.

12:20.147 --> 12:24.939
- I will not use sweatshop workers!
- No, they're sweatshop managers.

12:25.027 --> 12:28.478
- To help you use your time better.
- Break over! Back in kitchen!

12:28.572 --> 12:30.730
You fat, lazy and stupid!

12:32.867 --> 12:35.738
He's choking on his feedbag!

12:35.828 --> 12:38.284
Stand back! I know CPR!

12:44.920 --> 12:48.538
- Hey, you didn't have to spit in my mouth!
- Attaboy!

12:48.632 --> 12:52.380
Now, there are still a few voters
who doubt I'd be a trustworthy leader.

12:52.469 --> 12:55.553
So lock our alien
back in that mechanical teat-sucker

12:55.638 --> 12:57.927
and make more brainwashing potato salad!

12:58.016 --> 13:01.218
You deaf? You hear boss. Go! Go!

13:03.813 --> 13:09.317
In my darkest hour, I thought
God had forsaken me, but then, a miracle.

13:09.401 --> 13:13.315
The Panthers fumbled and the Dolphins
ran it back to cover the point spread.

13:13.405 --> 13:17.449
And that is how I bought my Camry.
Ah, here we go.

13:17.533 --> 13:22.491
OK, the votes have been tallied.
Our next deacon is...

13:22.580 --> 13:26.873
- Stan Smith.
- Yes! Yes! I am the chosen one.

13:26.959 --> 13:32.083
You know what this is? A deacon fanny.
Yeah! Look at it. Bet you wish you had one.

13:33.173 --> 13:38.000
There's one person I'd like to thank, without
whom this would not have been possible.

13:38.094 --> 13:40.667
Karl Rove.

13:40.763 --> 13:44.013
Karl? Karl, where are you?
There he is! Come on up.

13:46.143 --> 13:48.100
I'm good right here.

13:48.187 --> 13:51.187
My work is done. Farewell, Stan.

13:55.318 --> 13:58.105
It's official. I beat Chuck White!

13:58.196 --> 13:59.690
Let's celebrate!

13:59.781 --> 14:03.825
Why don't we make Roger squirt us out
a round of his delicious alien boob slime?

14:03.910 --> 14:09.070
Nice try, but my reproductive cycle's over.
Guess I got it out of my system.

14:22.343 --> 14:27.586
Mom, Dad.
I think... I think I'm pregnant.

14:29.683 --> 14:33.515
You can't be pregnant.
You're a virgin! And a boy!

14:33.604 --> 14:37.352
Tell that to my swollen ankles
and tender nipples!

14:37.440 --> 14:42.067
You know what? I just remembered,
I have a sweater soaking in the sink.

14:42.153 --> 14:45.403
- What did you do to my son?
- How do you even know it's mine?

14:45.490 --> 14:48.609
He must have sucked out my egg
during mouth-to-mouth.

14:48.701 --> 14:53.777
So Steve is carrying an alien baby
in some sort of faux uterus.

14:53.872 --> 14:57.075
How great is it
that I started Xanax yesterday?

14:57.167 --> 14:58.994
You knocked up my boy?

14:59.085 --> 15:02.205
I warned you I was
going through my reproductive cycle.

15:02.297 --> 15:06.424
- And FYI, honey, Steve came on to me.
- How could you do this to me?

15:06.509 --> 15:09.510
This is what happens
when you give it up for free.

15:09.595 --> 15:12.928
- Why are you yelling at me?
- I figured you'd be in this situation,

15:13.015 --> 15:15.636
- so that's what I prepared for!
- What am I gonna do?

15:15.726 --> 15:19.675
Whatever you want. A pregnant boy
still has the right to choose.

15:19.771 --> 15:22.392
Not in this house!
We're conservatives,

15:22.482 --> 15:25.767
and the one way
we don't like to kill things is that way!

15:27.820 --> 15:29.943
Way to go, Deacon!

15:30.823 --> 15:33.528
Aw, put your money away.
Deacons drink for free.

15:35.077 --> 15:37.828
You may have finally
beaten me, Smith.

15:37.913 --> 15:41.198
But one day you'll stumble,
and I'll have the last laugh.

15:41.291 --> 15:43.746
That's not the one I mean.

15:43.835 --> 15:47.085
- Hey, Mr Fishburne.
- Yo! What up, G? Two fingers.

15:47.171 --> 15:51.750
Last time, he mistook me for Laurence
Fishburne. I just never corrected him.

15:51.842 --> 15:55.970
What a mess! If they find out my son
is pregnant, I'll lose my deaconship,

15:56.055 --> 16:00.182
- and Chuck White wins again!
- Stan, forget Chuck White.

16:00.267 --> 16:04.893
Your son is confused and scared,
and he needs you.

16:04.979 --> 16:07.470
I said two fingers, bitch!

16:08.524 --> 16:12.853
Now, go be a father to your son,
my strong black brother.

16:16.365 --> 16:18.737
Stan, what's going on?

16:18.826 --> 16:23.534
You were right, Francine. I've let
this ridiculous rivalry cloud my judgement.

16:23.622 --> 16:26.825
This family comes first.
That's why I rented this camper

16:26.916 --> 16:29.870
to drive us all down to Mexico
so Steve can have his baby.

16:29.961 --> 16:32.119
- Mexico?
- That's right.

16:32.213 --> 16:34.501
Or as I like to call it,
God's blind spot.

16:34.590 --> 16:37.710
Steve, are you sure
you want to have this child?

16:37.801 --> 16:41.550
Yeah, I guess so.
Roger, what do you say?

16:41.638 --> 16:45.636
- You ready, partner?
- Oh, yeah. Fatherhood. Jazzed.

16:45.725 --> 16:50.636
It's not like I wanted to do anything with
my life, like learn to surf or go to Jerusalem.

16:50.730 --> 16:54.562
- Are you drunk?
- Get used to it!

16:59.947 --> 17:01.322
Steve Smith?

17:01.406 --> 17:06.068
I'm gonna go in with Steve for his prenatal
exam alone. It's kind of a father-son thing.

17:06.161 --> 17:10.787
Oh, OK. Hayley and I'll go say hello to
the donkey running around the cancer ward.

17:10.873 --> 17:12.949
Steve, I spoke to your father,

17:13.041 --> 17:17.667
and he informs me you have a growth
you would like me to "take care of'.

17:17.755 --> 17:20.921
You know, that "inside zit" we talked about.

17:21.008 --> 17:25.385
So you want me to get rid of it.
But I thought we were conservatives.

17:25.470 --> 17:29.337
We are - in America. Down here,
we're just Juan and Pedro Gomez,

17:29.432 --> 17:33.299
orange farmers from Oaxaca,
who've come in for a delicate procedure.

17:33.394 --> 17:39.147
OK, Dad. I know if Mr White found out you
had a pregnant son, he'd be all...

17:39.233 --> 17:42.068
and you'd be all, "Every freakin' time!"

17:42.152 --> 17:45.236
So I won't have this baby.

17:45.322 --> 17:51.490
Wait. You think that's what this is all about?
Beating Chuck White? Am I that awful?

17:51.578 --> 17:56.370
- Dad, we're in Mexico. I'm in stirrups.
- And I've been drinking.

17:56.457 --> 18:00.455
You know what? The hell with Chuck White!
And forget the deaconship!

18:00.544 --> 18:04.624
- Son, you're keeping your alien baby.
- Thanks, Dad.

18:04.715 --> 18:08.878
- Did you say "alien baby"?
- No, I said "doctor's corpse found in desert".

18:08.969 --> 18:11.045
Oh, right. Right.

18:16.893 --> 18:20.261
- Where have you been, Steve?
- Hey, Betsy. I was gonna call you,

18:20.354 --> 18:23.889
but I'm kinda going through
some stuff right now.

18:23.982 --> 18:26.058
Boy stuff.

18:27.444 --> 18:32.106
I stuck the landing for you.
That's how much I like you.

18:38.412 --> 18:41.947
Wow! Sunday again, huh?
Boy, that pissed by, didn't it?

18:42.041 --> 18:44.366
At least tomorrow's TGIM.

18:46.420 --> 18:50.204
- What? You got something better?
- Father, may I say a few words?

18:50.298 --> 18:54.794
Oh! Whatever. Man, I remember
when you used to be able to smoke in here.

18:54.886 --> 18:57.555
I wanted to thank you all
for electing me deacon.

18:57.639 --> 19:00.841
Unfortunately,
something unexpected has come up,

19:00.933 --> 19:03.850
and I have to abdicate my position.

19:05.562 --> 19:08.931
- But why?
- It's a bizarre situation.

19:09.024 --> 19:13.567
<i>Not 8 Simple Rules let's-keep-it-going-</i>
after-the-father-died bizarre, but close.

19:18.950 --> 19:21.904
Hands off! Just cos I'm your baby daddy
doesn't mean...

19:21.994 --> 19:24.366
I'm not pregnant any more!

19:24.455 --> 19:26.661
You must have passed it on to someone else.

19:26.749 --> 19:29.785
How many mouths
you been mouth-to-mouthing?

19:29.877 --> 19:33.826
Yeah, run! Run to the arms of your whore!
It's what you're good at!

19:33.922 --> 19:38.418
- So, again, thanks for understanding.
- But you still haven't told us why!

19:38.509 --> 19:41.843
Fine. Let's see. I...

19:41.929 --> 19:44.005
I've been possessed by the Devil.

19:48.435 --> 19:52.978
- That doesn't sound very possessed.
- Say it into a microphone.

19:57.610 --> 20:00.066
We'll call you in Iowa
once you get settled.

20:00.154 --> 20:03.523
So does this mean
I don't have to do gymnastics any more?

20:03.616 --> 20:04.695
Of course it does!

20:04.784 --> 20:10.619
You should have thought of that
before doing the splits all over town!

20:10.706 --> 20:13.790
- Steve!
- Betsy. Oh, this is all my fault.

20:13.875 --> 20:17.576
No, it's not. I knew kissing
got you pregnant, and I did it anyway.

20:17.671 --> 20:23.091
Besides, I couldn't be happier.
Gymnastics was a prison I'm finally free from.

20:23.176 --> 20:26.959
Now that I'm an unwed teenage mother,
the world is my oyster!

20:27.054 --> 20:30.221
Goodbye, Steve. I'll never forget you.

20:56.915 --> 20:59.157
So what if Chuck White is deacon now?

20:59.251 --> 21:02.915
So what if he has a bigger paycheck,
a better car and a nicer house?

21:03.004 --> 21:06.622
None of that matters, because I've got...
