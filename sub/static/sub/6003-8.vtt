00:50.378 --> 00:53.179
Well, he's already half embalmed.

00:54.715 --> 00:57.317
Let's get him up on the
table and finish the job.

00:59.880 --> 01:04.988

01:10.730 --> 01:13.131
Can I get you anything else, Eleanor?

01:13.266 --> 01:15.334
You can stop treating me like an invalid.

01:15.335 --> 01:17.469
I feel much better.

01:21.074 --> 01:24.810
I even think I might have
been able to manage the ball.

01:24.911 --> 01:26.945
I would have loved to have gone.

01:27.013 --> 01:29.614
I was just afraid you weren't

01:29.648 --> 01:31.716
up to it physically.

01:33.586 --> 01:36.654
I may be up to more than you realize.

01:37.990 --> 01:39.724
Everett...

01:42.794 --> 01:45.896
I think it's time for
us to rebuild our family.

01:51.303 --> 01:53.170
Leave the light on.

02:28.205 --> 02:31.374
Note the effect on the pupils of
a few drops of adrenaline chloride.

02:33.077 --> 02:35.078
It dilates.

02:35.179 --> 02:37.680
So what? It's to be expected.

02:39.249 --> 02:42.618
Is this the extent of your research?

02:42.852 --> 02:47.122
Dr. Zinberg insisted on the
incremental approach to laboratory work.

02:47.191 --> 02:49.458
This isn't incremental.

02:49.493 --> 02:52.027
This is immobility.

02:52.229 --> 02:54.397
Well, there's one other
thing I've been working on

02:54.531 --> 02:56.832
you might find somewhat more interesting.

02:56.866 --> 02:58.868
Potassium chloride.

03:13.083 --> 03:15.450
Cardiac arrhythmia.

03:15.451 --> 03:17.419
Sorry, Bertie.

03:17.453 --> 03:19.788
Afraid you lost bunny.

03:19.789 --> 03:21.890
Mm-hmm.

03:21.925 --> 03:24.092
What are you doing?

03:24.194 --> 03:25.827
You might want to stand back.

03:25.928 --> 03:28.129
The effect is usually instantaneous.

03:33.736 --> 03:36.504
Now that's what you should be working on.

03:38.741 --> 03:41.443
Dr. Thackery, you need to
come with me right away.

03:41.577 --> 03:43.645
Where is he?!

03:46.282 --> 03:48.149
You think I'm messing?

03:48.150 --> 03:50.117
Mr. Brockhurst.

03:50.152 --> 03:52.886
I'm here for my girls.

03:52.921 --> 03:55.456
That ship has sailed.

03:55.590 --> 03:58.159
I suggest you put the gun away and leave

03:58.293 --> 03:59.973
before I'm forced to call the police.

03:59.995 --> 04:03.164
Call the police! You're the one
who's guilty of a crime here.

04:03.298 --> 04:06.100
This is theft. Those girls are my property.

04:06.235 --> 04:08.169
Give them back the way they were before.

04:08.270 --> 04:11.372
I can't do that. No, listen.

04:11.473 --> 04:14.474
Listen to me. So many Siamese twins

04:14.608 --> 04:17.243
have asked me to perform this operation.

04:17.411 --> 04:21.113
There are some sisters
in my office right now.

04:21.249 --> 04:23.850
They're Swedish. They're 12 years old.

04:24.018 --> 04:25.919
- Bullshit!
- They're blonde. They're blue-eyed.

04:25.920 --> 04:28.488
They're beautiful. They're...

04:28.589 --> 04:30.190
they're attached at the rib cage,

04:30.258 --> 04:32.359
so I can't separate them.

04:32.493 --> 04:35.061
But a man like you can make a tidy profit.

04:35.096 --> 04:36.696
Let me see them.

04:36.798 --> 04:38.365
They're in my office. That way.

04:38.499 --> 04:40.933
No funny business.

04:44.371 --> 04:45.938
Good job.

04:45.972 --> 04:47.406
Believe it or not,

04:47.541 --> 04:49.301
that's the first time
I ever got to use that.

05:14.801 --> 05:16.521
I wonder how you have the good fortune

05:16.669 --> 05:20.605
to acquire such substantial
sums of money and so quickly.

05:20.707 --> 05:22.607
Well, that's no concern of yours.

05:24.043 --> 05:26.711
Perhaps it should be.

05:26.979 --> 05:30.448
We can become partners and share
in each other's good fortune.

05:30.483 --> 05:32.584
I can assure you

05:32.719 --> 05:35.219
the money in that envelope
is all that remains

05:35.321 --> 05:38.557
of any fortune of mine, good or bad.

05:45.398 --> 05:47.566
You're not gonna count it?

05:47.667 --> 05:50.134
After our long acquaintanceship?

05:50.169 --> 05:52.437
The girl is yours.

05:52.504 --> 05:53.871
Can I give you a receipt?

05:54.006 --> 05:56.974
Oh, no. No, that won't be necessary.

06:00.246 --> 06:03.747
Then may I give you a piece of advice?

06:03.916 --> 06:08.152
Take to heart the words
of the wise man who said,

06:08.220 --> 06:12.790
"Who, being loved, is poor?"

06:13.893 --> 06:16.760
Confucius?

06:16.762 --> 06:18.562
Oscar Wilde.

06:21.733 --> 06:23.934
I think we should sell this house.

06:24.036 --> 06:26.437
There's simply not enough room.

06:26.538 --> 06:28.139
Was that a thinly veiled hint

06:28.374 --> 06:30.775
that I should be returning
home sooner rather than later?

06:30.776 --> 06:32.876
Of course not, my darling.

06:32.977 --> 06:35.646
You can stay as long as you like.

06:35.814 --> 06:39.449
We love having Dorothy
here, don't we, Everett?

06:39.651 --> 06:43.520
Yes, I wonder if we need
to impose on her any longer.

06:43.622 --> 06:45.322
You've been doing so well lately,

06:45.424 --> 06:47.524
as demonstrated by recent events.

06:47.626 --> 06:50.661
Oh, I'm sure it's no imposition.

06:50.829 --> 06:53.897
And it does so brighten my
day simply to look at her.

06:53.998 --> 06:56.299
Then why do you want to sell the house?

06:56.501 --> 07:00.269
Because there isn't enough room
for all the children we'll have.

07:03.073 --> 07:05.474
And it would be nice for
them to have a backyard

07:05.576 --> 07:07.510
so they can play on the grass.

07:12.783 --> 07:14.951
- Dr. Gallinger?
- Yes?

07:15.152 --> 07:18.655
Frank Moorhouse of the New
York Detective's Bureau.

07:18.789 --> 07:20.723
I'm sorry to bother you at this hour,

07:20.791 --> 07:22.558
but may I have a word?

07:22.626 --> 07:24.694
Of course. Please come in.

07:30.633 --> 07:34.569
My wife Eleanor. Her sister Miss Walcott.

07:34.671 --> 07:36.805
May I present Detective Moorhouse.

07:38.641 --> 07:40.108
I'll get straight to the point.

07:40.343 --> 07:44.613
Ahem, I understand that you are
acquainted with a Dr. Henry Cotton.

07:44.614 --> 07:46.481
Yes.

07:46.549 --> 07:48.449
I'm sorry to have to inform you

07:48.485 --> 07:50.519
the doctor is dead.

07:50.520 --> 07:52.420
Poisoned.

07:54.223 --> 07:56.224
What happened?

07:56.325 --> 07:58.005
That's what we're trying to find out.

08:00.396 --> 08:03.598
I've been retracing his movements
in the days preceding his death,

08:03.699 --> 08:06.801
hoping to identify a likely suspect.

08:06.935 --> 08:09.537
His appointment book
says that he dined here

08:09.571 --> 08:11.439
the night before he died.

08:11.540 --> 08:14.242
Did he say anything that suggested

08:14.276 --> 08:16.711
he feared for his life?

08:16.745 --> 08:18.345
No, I don't think so.

08:18.446 --> 08:20.714
I'm sorry to interrupt, Everett.

08:20.848 --> 08:22.949
May I offer you a hot cup of tea?

08:24.952 --> 08:28.122
Well, that'd be very kind
of you, Mrs. Gallinger.

08:28.123 --> 08:29.823
Thank you.

08:30.025 --> 08:32.926
Everett, could I trouble you
to light the stove, please?

08:34.261 --> 08:35.995
Would you excuse me a moment?

08:36.097 --> 08:37.431
Please, won't you have a seat?

08:37.432 --> 08:38.898
Yeah.

08:43.203 --> 08:45.904
- Biscuit?
- No.

09:00.787 --> 09:02.855
I'm sorry, Everett.

09:02.989 --> 09:05.524
I didn't think they'd catch me up so soon.

09:06.993 --> 09:09.027
Catch you up so soon at what, dear?

09:10.430 --> 09:12.697
Well, I killed Dr. Cotton.

09:16.970 --> 09:19.204
I put this in his soup.

09:29.983 --> 09:31.784
Why?

09:31.785 --> 09:34.219
Why?

09:34.454 --> 09:37.389
You told me you credited him
with how well you've become.

09:37.457 --> 09:39.357
- Why?
- Oh, Everett.

09:39.358 --> 09:41.426
Can't you see?

09:41.461 --> 09:43.695
I'm not well at all.

10:10.355 --> 10:12.156
Don't say anything.

10:12.190 --> 10:13.925
Let me handle this.

10:24.737 --> 10:26.770
Forgive me.

10:26.905 --> 10:29.840
My wife and I were overcome by the news.

10:30.008 --> 10:31.288
I was just telling the detective

10:31.408 --> 10:33.208
a little of your history with Dr. Cotton.

10:33.210 --> 10:35.178
Remarkable man.

10:35.312 --> 10:37.214
What's more, I'm proud to say,

10:37.381 --> 10:40.516
a real bond of friendship
developed between us

10:40.652 --> 10:43.086
during his treatment of my wife.

10:46.323 --> 10:47.824
Milk and sugar?

10:47.892 --> 10:49.592
Milk, please.

11:02.572 --> 11:04.240
This one's for you.

11:42.378 --> 11:45.580
Mr. Dominczyk,

11:45.715 --> 11:48.850
I'm afraid I've got some bad news.

11:50.586 --> 11:54.154
The hospital's board has
decided to close the ward.

11:55.624 --> 11:58.091
There's only you left.

11:58.227 --> 12:02.262
And frankly, I have no
idea how to help you.

12:04.299 --> 12:06.033
You were hophead?

12:08.002 --> 12:09.837
Cocaine.

12:11.473 --> 12:13.541
And heroin.

12:13.575 --> 12:15.443
How did you stop?

12:18.347 --> 12:20.481
A woman is helping me.

12:21.850 --> 12:23.717
A friend.

12:25.420 --> 12:27.154
We talk.

12:28.790 --> 12:30.357
Maybe I'll talk to her.

12:31.826 --> 12:33.626
How's the fit on this one?

12:33.694 --> 12:35.495
Not sure yet.

12:35.529 --> 12:36.863
How can you not be sure?

12:36.998 --> 12:39.499
It ain't like trying on a pair of boots.

12:39.600 --> 12:41.634
Takes a bit of...

12:41.636 --> 12:43.937
concentration.

12:44.105 --> 12:47.074
Blood flow is important,
but so is a snug fit.

12:47.208 --> 12:49.242
You sure know a lot about a fella's pecker

12:49.443 --> 12:51.645
for someone who's been
avoiding them her whole life.

12:51.646 --> 12:53.781
I'm just saying that if
this is too uncomfortable,

12:53.782 --> 12:55.983
we can try it out on a stray dog instead.

12:56.117 --> 12:58.318
Or maybe you could quit your gobbing.

12:58.352 --> 13:00.253
Make yourself useful

13:00.354 --> 13:03.190
so I can maintain myself here.

13:04.492 --> 13:07.093
Useful how?

13:07.127 --> 13:09.462
I don't know.

13:09.497 --> 13:11.230
Sing me a song.

13:12.366 --> 13:14.467
A song?

13:14.468 --> 13:16.202
Yeah.

13:16.304 --> 13:19.405
Help put me in the proper mood.

13:19.507 --> 13:21.508
But nothing about God or saints

13:21.542 --> 13:24.343
or fucking baby Jesus.

13:24.412 --> 13:26.646
I ain't singing nothing dirty.

13:26.747 --> 13:28.415
Why, you know something like that?

13:28.416 --> 13:30.249
No.

13:30.250 --> 13:32.519
Oh.

13:32.520 --> 13:35.555
What about...

13:35.589 --> 13:38.190
"My Wild Irish Rose"?

13:41.093 --> 13:46.932
♪ My wild Irish rose

13:46.999 --> 13:49.100
♪ The sweetest flower...

13:49.101 --> 13:50.702
Yeah, no.

13:50.870 --> 13:53.030
No, that voice is just
making the thing retreat...

13:53.105 --> 13:56.174
...and look for cover.

13:56.343 --> 13:57.709
Oh! Oh! That's working for me, though!

13:57.777 --> 14:01.279
Do that again!

14:05.452 --> 14:07.686
On to new business.

14:07.854 --> 14:10.455
The Search Committee has been tireless

14:10.689 --> 14:13.490
in its quest to identify a
builder to finish construction

14:13.625 --> 14:15.927
on the new hospital without further delay

14:15.961 --> 14:18.429
or unanticipated expense.

14:18.530 --> 14:20.097
After careful consideration,

14:20.232 --> 14:22.066
we are pleased to nominate for the job

14:22.267 --> 14:26.604
Mr. Raphael Warren of the
firm Tate, Warren, and Bond.

14:26.638 --> 14:28.906
His CV is in front of you,

14:29.074 --> 14:31.475
but I think you're already
acquainted with his work,

14:31.744 --> 14:35.245
especially the lavish hotels he's
built in midtown for Colonel Astor.

14:35.414 --> 14:37.054
And he has the added benefit

14:37.115 --> 14:38.649
of being highly recommended by my son.

14:38.650 --> 14:40.050
So if there are no objections,

14:40.151 --> 14:42.119
I move we put this nomination to a vote.

14:42.220 --> 14:44.021
- All in favor.
- Aye.

14:44.055 --> 14:45.589
Mr. Barrow.

14:50.595 --> 14:52.829
Mr. Warren.

14:52.930 --> 14:54.831
- Right there, sir.
- Thank you.

14:58.102 --> 15:01.071
Mr. Warren, welcome to the Knick.

15:01.171 --> 15:03.640
I just have one thing to say to you

15:03.741 --> 15:05.976
and I hope you'll take it to heart.

15:06.076 --> 15:08.678
Your brief with us, in a word,

15:08.679 --> 15:11.848
is to economize.

15:11.916 --> 15:13.750
In my experience,

15:13.918 --> 15:17.286
economizing is not always the best economy.

15:17.454 --> 15:21.090
But I've looked over your
architect's blueprints

15:21.190 --> 15:22.992
and I believe you'll be pleased

15:23.092 --> 15:25.894
with my revised cost estimates.

15:25.995 --> 15:28.497
Good. Then Barrow is your man.

15:28.765 --> 15:33.035
Mr. Warren, may I say I look forward
to a fruitful working relationship.

15:33.136 --> 15:34.736
Well, that's settled, then.

15:34.771 --> 15:36.204
If there's no further business,

15:36.205 --> 15:38.674
- I move to adjourn.
- Aye.

15:38.708 --> 15:40.408
Thank you, gentlemen.

15:42.045 --> 15:43.765
- Congratulations.
- Thank you so much.

15:43.947 --> 15:45.713
- Very pleased to have you aboard.
- Pleasure to be here.

15:45.815 --> 15:47.782
Oh, Mr. Barrow, a word.

15:47.883 --> 15:49.217
- Welcome...
- Thank you so much.

15:49.218 --> 15:51.253
Now, my office is just downstairs.

15:51.354 --> 15:52.854
Would you mind waiting in the lobby?

15:52.855 --> 15:54.389
Of course.

15:57.660 --> 16:00.195
Mr. Barrow...

16:00.196 --> 16:02.330
Herman,

16:02.398 --> 16:04.633
you will be pleased to know

16:04.800 --> 16:08.503
that the club has voted
to grant your membership.

16:08.504 --> 16:10.905
Really?

16:13.041 --> 16:14.776
You know, I had given up hope.

16:15.043 --> 16:18.680
Well, you deserve it, if only in
recognition of all your hard work here.

16:18.814 --> 16:20.915
Now you're a man on the way up, Herman.

16:20.983 --> 16:22.616
You make the most of it.

16:22.852 --> 16:25.820
Oh, and make sure that the club
secretary has your bank draft

16:25.988 --> 16:30.357
in the sum of $2,000 by
the close of business today.

16:30.493 --> 16:33.494
I thought the annual
membership fee was $200.

16:33.496 --> 16:34.796
Oh, it is.

16:34.897 --> 16:36.831
But that's in addition to the 2,000

16:37.065 --> 16:40.068
that each member is being asked to
subscribe to the club's expansion.

16:40.168 --> 16:41.769
We're building a ladies' wing.

16:41.837 --> 16:43.671
Ah.

16:43.739 --> 16:44.906
Money's not a problem, I hope.

16:44.907 --> 16:46.941
No, consider it done.

16:46.942 --> 16:48.475
Well, good day.

17:02.690 --> 17:04.790
Dr. Thackery.

17:04.858 --> 17:06.960
Thank you for coming.

17:07.060 --> 17:10.363
This lady says that she knows you.

17:10.565 --> 17:12.866
Really? I don't believe I've
had the pleasure, Miss...

17:12.867 --> 17:14.267
O'Connor.

17:14.367 --> 17:17.369
You did this to me, remember?

17:17.570 --> 17:20.506
Straightened my nose with
part of an old gold earring.

17:22.542 --> 17:25.810
Sorry, I have no recollection
of this whatsoever.

17:25.811 --> 17:27.946
At Cromartie.

17:27.981 --> 17:30.082
I paid you in heroin.

17:31.618 --> 17:33.419
Excuse me.

17:35.322 --> 17:37.690
Everyone knew you were
the famous Dr. Thackery.

17:52.773 --> 17:55.407
You say I fixed it with a gold earring?

17:55.475 --> 17:57.777
It belonged to my mother.

17:57.945 --> 18:02.815
Well, I'm afraid your mother
wasn't entirely truthful.

18:02.916 --> 18:04.884
It isn't gold and it's corroding.

18:05.018 --> 18:07.753
I suspect that's what's
causing the swelling.

18:07.921 --> 18:10.789
I'll get the admitting
nurse to schedule the surgery

18:10.957 --> 18:13.424
and I'll replace it with
something more permanent.

18:13.425 --> 18:15.726
Like what?

18:15.761 --> 18:19.030
Something else.

18:19.164 --> 18:21.332
I have to warn you, I'm all out of heroin.

18:23.002 --> 18:24.869
It's on the house.

18:26.973 --> 18:28.639
Thank you.

18:40.051 --> 18:41.819
What's the matter with you?

18:44.789 --> 18:47.591
I've been getting these
terrible stabbing pains.

18:48.860 --> 18:50.494
Is it worse after a meal?

18:50.529 --> 18:53.331
No, it's not an ulcer.

18:53.532 --> 18:56.233
Well, let's go next door so I
can perform a proper examination.

18:56.235 --> 18:58.268
No, thank you.

18:58.370 --> 19:00.538
At least allow me to look at your stool.

19:02.474 --> 19:05.508
Not even if you went up
there and got it yourself.

19:07.211 --> 19:08.611
It's a fine house, Mr. Barrow.

19:08.746 --> 19:10.413
I can think of any number
of prospective buyers

19:10.548 --> 19:13.115
to show it to at your
convenience, of course.

19:13.217 --> 19:15.017
To be honest with you, Mr. Stern,

19:15.219 --> 19:19.789
I currently find myself in
a bit of financial distress.

19:20.024 --> 19:23.426
Consequently, I haven't time
to show the house publically.

19:23.594 --> 19:26.262
I don't understand. How
do you intend to sell it?

19:26.430 --> 19:28.598
Well, I was thinking that
you might buy the house.

19:28.599 --> 19:30.400
As an investment.

19:30.568 --> 19:33.970
If you were willing to
pay cash for it today,

19:34.104 --> 19:37.306
I am sure I can make it worth your while.

19:37.375 --> 19:39.675
Have you a figure in mind?

19:39.742 --> 19:42.778
How much is the house worth?

19:42.779 --> 19:44.613
5,000.

19:46.449 --> 19:48.316
It's yours for 3,500.

19:48.451 --> 19:50.419
Can you clear out by the end of the week?

19:50.420 --> 19:52.388
Of course.

19:54.357 --> 19:57.158
The procedure's called septoplasty.

19:57.260 --> 19:59.194
I place you under general sedation

19:59.362 --> 20:02.264
and then I'll insert this
into your nasal cavities.

20:03.132 --> 20:04.599
What is it made of?

20:04.600 --> 20:07.167
It's celluloid.

20:07.303 --> 20:10.104
It's the material they
use to make motion film.

20:10.206 --> 20:13.374
It's strong. It's malleable.

20:13.576 --> 20:17.144
I'll use it to give support
when I trim the excess flesh.

20:20.716 --> 20:23.217
Thank you, John,

20:23.285 --> 20:25.352
for doing me this favor.

20:26.622 --> 20:28.956
I know you had reservations about it.

20:30.158 --> 20:32.493
I wanted to ask you one small favor.

20:33.795 --> 20:35.595
Of course.

20:35.831 --> 20:40.234
Would you consider talking to a
patient of mine on the addiction ward?

20:40.335 --> 20:43.938
I think you may be able to help him

20:44.139 --> 20:47.842
the way you helped me when
I operated on the twins.

20:47.843 --> 20:50.144
Oh.

20:50.345 --> 20:53.013
Don't you think that the man
would only be further upset

20:53.148 --> 20:57.351
by talking to someone who looks like me?

20:57.585 --> 21:00.554
The important thing will be the
effect your words have on him.

21:02.124 --> 21:04.524
I mean, he doesn't have to see you at all.

21:10.464 --> 21:12.498
A gentleman wishes to
speak with you, ma'am.

21:17.371 --> 21:19.538
Hello, this is Effie Barrow.

21:19.706 --> 21:21.574
Mrs. Barrow, I'm sorry to bother you,

21:21.842 --> 21:24.710
but your husband was otherwise
engaged when I telephoned the hospital.

21:24.711 --> 21:26.812
Could you convey a message to him for me?

21:26.847 --> 21:28.647
Who's speaking, please?

21:28.849 --> 21:30.969
Please tell him the Kenney
Vacuum Sweeping System

21:31.118 --> 21:33.586
has been installed as per his instructions.

21:33.654 --> 21:35.654
Vacuum Sweeping System?

21:35.689 --> 21:37.323
It's the newest thing.

21:37.557 --> 21:39.992
It allows you to vacuum carpets
in any room in your house

21:39.993 --> 21:43.228
using a portable tube connected to
a machine housed in the basement.

21:43.362 --> 21:45.998
There's been no such installation here.

21:46.132 --> 21:48.266
It's for the new house, Mrs. Barrow,

21:48.367 --> 21:50.235
the one on West 74th Street.

21:50.236 --> 21:51.536
Oh, dear me.

21:51.671 --> 21:53.805
I hope I didn't ruin the surprise.

21:53.840 --> 21:55.440
Be sure to tell him.

21:55.641 --> 21:58.477
I can't decide if I'd rather see you

21:58.544 --> 22:02.414
in diamonds or sapphires.

22:03.582 --> 22:05.349
Why not both?

22:05.350 --> 22:06.850
Why not?

22:07.052 --> 22:09.987
Which do you think would
look better with your uniform?

22:10.088 --> 22:13.757
I won't always be wearing my uniform.

22:13.859 --> 22:15.792
Or anything else for that matter.

22:17.162 --> 22:18.962
Neely, there you are.

22:18.997 --> 22:20.564
What do you think?

22:20.732 --> 22:25.201
Would Lucy look better
in diamonds or sapphires?

22:25.236 --> 22:27.170
With those blue eyes?

22:27.205 --> 22:29.072
Sapphires, I'm sure.

22:31.242 --> 22:34.710
Well, I could sit in the
lap of luxury all day long,

22:34.778 --> 22:36.812
but I best get back to work.

22:37.849 --> 22:39.949
It was nice talking to you both.

22:41.452 --> 22:43.685
Oh, so why am I fetching you here?

22:43.854 --> 22:47.923
I was delivering thank-you
notes for the ball.

22:47.924 --> 22:50.125
Well, hop in.

22:50.126 --> 22:51.793
I'm famished.

22:53.263 --> 22:54.896
All set?

22:57.234 --> 22:58.967
I've been investigating the death

22:59.135 --> 23:01.570
of Inspector Speight of
the Health Department.

23:01.637 --> 23:04.105
Phillip's father found out

23:04.240 --> 23:06.774
and since he objects to me doing anything

23:06.876 --> 23:08.776
other than my matrimonial duties,

23:08.978 --> 23:11.745
he's had men following me
whenever I leave the house.

23:14.216 --> 23:15.849
I'm sure he means well.

23:19.889 --> 23:22.856
Look, if it bothers you so much,
why don't I have a word with him?

23:22.892 --> 23:24.725
That's not it.

23:24.760 --> 23:26.793
What is it, then?

23:26.794 --> 23:28.595
Oh, Henry.

23:28.729 --> 23:31.264
My investigation took a terrible turn

23:31.299 --> 23:34.033
and it's implicated Dad.

23:35.970 --> 23:38.238
What do you mean?

23:38.306 --> 23:40.740
He's violating maritime law,

23:40.841 --> 23:43.643
immigration statutes, and he's res...

23:57.257 --> 24:01.393
He's been issuing second-class
tickets to passengers in steerage.

24:01.494 --> 24:03.229
Why the devil would he do that?

24:03.330 --> 24:04.963
Because the passengers are sick.

24:05.165 --> 24:08.300
Second-class passengers
disembark right into Manhattan

24:08.535 --> 24:12.037
and he's been bribing the port
inspectors here to look the other way.

24:12.272 --> 24:16.208
So Dad avoids millions of
dollars in fines and return fares.

24:16.343 --> 24:19.645
That's what Speight was investigating.

24:19.813 --> 24:23.182
I can only assume Dad found
out and had him killed.

24:28.054 --> 24:30.421
But do you really think he
has the stomach for murder?

24:30.489 --> 24:32.557
The proof is in there.

24:32.658 --> 24:35.059
He's responsible for the outbreaks

24:35.194 --> 24:38.062
of bubonic plague here
and in San Francisco.

24:39.698 --> 24:41.533
There were outbreaks in Hawaii, too.

24:41.633 --> 24:43.033
Perfectly timed to the arrival

24:43.035 --> 24:44.935
of our ships from the West Coast.

24:47.473 --> 24:51.008
I guess he... he got desperate.

24:53.312 --> 24:55.480
And this is how he tried to...

24:55.514 --> 24:57.215
to right the ship.

25:00.519 --> 25:02.853
I just... I can't believe it.

25:16.602 --> 25:18.502
Dr. Gallinger.

25:18.570 --> 25:19.904
How do you do, Dr. Warner?

25:20.005 --> 25:22.472
May I present my wife Eleanor

25:22.541 --> 25:23.941
and her sister Miss Walcott.

25:24.175 --> 25:26.944
Ladies, pardon us a moment while
we discuss the arrangements.

25:33.118 --> 25:34.751
I wanted you to see our day room.

25:34.919 --> 25:36.953
I think your wife will
find it quite soothing.

25:47.131 --> 25:49.465
She was formerly a patient
of Dr. Cotton's, no?

25:49.466 --> 25:51.134
That's correct.

25:51.402 --> 25:54.170
That's why I must insist that
she undergo no medical procedures

25:54.304 --> 25:56.572
without explicit permission from me first.

25:56.606 --> 25:58.173
Put your mind at ease.

25:58.308 --> 26:00.543
I don't share the late
Dr. Cotton's enthusiasm

26:00.644 --> 26:03.045
for surgical solutions to everything.

26:03.280 --> 26:06.349
Her physical and psychological
condition will be carefully assessed

26:06.450 --> 26:07.816
and a determination will be made

26:07.817 --> 26:10.085
as to the preferred mode of treatment.

26:10.120 --> 26:12.988
Will she be happy?

26:13.157 --> 26:15.758
If she's going to spend
the rest of her days here,

26:15.892 --> 26:17.993
I want her to have as fulfilling a life

26:18.128 --> 26:20.495
as is possible under the circumstances.

26:20.629 --> 26:22.497
We'll do our best to see that it's so.

26:28.938 --> 26:31.239
I think this is a mistake.

26:31.307 --> 26:34.309
This is how it has to be.

26:34.444 --> 26:36.944
Please, don't leave me here.

27:01.836 --> 27:03.771
Well, what do you think?

27:04.005 --> 27:08.141
I think you're making a
mountain out of a molehill.

27:08.443 --> 27:13.146
As I understand it, they'll need more
nurses at the new Knick, not less.

27:13.181 --> 27:17.117
Sure, more like you.

27:17.119 --> 27:18.652
Meaning what?

27:18.786 --> 27:21.655
Meaning they'll need fewer girls like me.

27:21.689 --> 27:24.057
You have two eyes, Lucy.

27:24.326 --> 27:28.962
Henry Robertson has made over the
nursing staff into a beauty contest

27:29.131 --> 27:32.633
worthy of the new hospital's
stylish decorations

27:32.700 --> 27:34.667
and fancy pneumatic elevators.

27:35.669 --> 27:37.203
And I'll thank you very much,

27:37.404 --> 27:41.040
but a plain girl like me is
nobody's idea of an ornament.

27:41.041 --> 27:42.942
No.

27:44.578 --> 27:46.346
Lucy, you have a telephone call.

27:52.553 --> 27:54.354
This is Lucy Elkins.

27:57.090 --> 27:59.959
Yes, A.D. Elkins is my father. Who is this?

28:05.831 --> 28:07.966
You follow me, please.

28:09.202 --> 28:12.036
I found a card in his billfold

28:12.238 --> 28:14.939
with your name and the
Knickerbocker Hospital on it.

28:31.191 --> 28:32.824
Reverend Elkins.

28:32.925 --> 28:34.659
- Here, turn him over.
- Daddy?

28:34.760 --> 28:38.696
Daddy? Daddy?

28:38.798 --> 28:41.365
Lily was tanning his behind with a cat,

28:41.366 --> 28:43.001
like always.

28:43.135 --> 28:45.469
All of a sudden, his eyes
rolled back in his head.

28:47.573 --> 28:50.008
Has he done this before?

28:50.209 --> 28:52.643
Almost every day for the
past couple of months.

28:57.049 --> 28:59.117
Daddy.

29:00.152 --> 29:01.986
Daddy.

29:02.088 --> 29:05.123
He suffered a paralytic stroke.

29:07.926 --> 29:10.193
Is there anything we can do?

29:11.896 --> 29:14.697
Best I can do is keep him alive.

29:19.771 --> 29:21.604
Do you think he can hear us?

29:24.776 --> 29:26.743
Well, his eyes seem to be following you,

29:26.778 --> 29:28.878
so it's possible.

30:09.287 --> 30:12.188
I'd like to wait until morning to leave.

30:13.824 --> 30:15.592
Of course.

30:18.362 --> 30:21.364
Well, you must be pleased.

30:21.465 --> 30:22.999
With Eleanor's fate decided,

30:23.009 --> 30:24.809
you can continue on your
search for a husband.

30:24.868 --> 30:27.369
- Don't let's be mean about it.
- Isn't that what you told me?

30:27.370 --> 30:29.005
It is.

30:29.173 --> 30:31.240
But you know I didn't
want it to end this way.

30:33.243 --> 30:37.046
Although I do take some
comfort from the thought

30:37.214 --> 30:40.349
she wasn't undone by
some inherited weakness.

30:41.718 --> 30:45.621
So it's unlikely I'll suffer the same fate.

30:48.758 --> 30:50.926
I'm sure you won't.

30:53.864 --> 30:56.632
Strong,

30:56.666 --> 30:58.634
smart, beautiful.

31:04.074 --> 31:06.708
You Walcott girls come from superior stock.

31:10.080 --> 31:13.681
That statement is true
of the Gallinger men.

31:13.850 --> 31:17.718
Naturally my heredity is
identical to my sister's.

31:21.190 --> 31:23.291
People often commented on it.

31:25.895 --> 31:27.662
It's the eyes.

31:32.634 --> 31:34.769
The fullness of your lips.

31:39.242 --> 31:40.962
Will you look at that, Pounce?

31:40.977 --> 31:42.843
That horse has got a big tit on its back.

31:42.912 --> 31:44.946
That's a camel, you idiot.

31:45.081 --> 31:47.215
Comes from Arabia. Ask Harry, she knows.

31:47.250 --> 31:49.217
It's called a dromedary.

31:49.252 --> 31:51.052
A camel has two humps.

31:51.219 --> 31:53.020
I'd like two humps. How about it, Myrtle?

31:53.221 --> 31:55.423
- Watch your mouth around the ladies.
- Sorry, Sister.

31:55.424 --> 31:57.658
I'm not a sister anymore, Mr. Pouncey.

31:57.726 --> 31:59.994
- Oh, did she die?
- Who?

31:59.995 --> 32:01.762
Your sister.

32:01.830 --> 32:03.430
In a matter of speaking.

32:05.667 --> 32:09.136
Oh, look. Here's the Chamber of
Horrors I was telling you about.

32:09.304 --> 32:11.544
- Who's up for a spook?
- Come on, let's go, Myrtle.

32:15.075 --> 32:16.576
You coming?

32:16.611 --> 32:18.478
I'll wait over here.

32:18.613 --> 32:20.814
You're not on trial anymore, Harry.

32:20.981 --> 32:23.316
There's nothing saying you
can't have a little fun.

32:23.418 --> 32:25.785
Just not feeling right about it.

32:25.853 --> 32:27.821
You've no more debt to pay.

32:29.089 --> 32:30.824
God set you free, didn't He?

32:30.858 --> 32:32.892
At least His men did.

32:33.027 --> 32:35.293
Besides, you didn't take a vow of misery.

32:35.462 --> 32:38.196
There's no harm in a
few smiles now and then.

32:39.766 --> 32:42.134
In 10 years or so,

32:42.268 --> 32:45.604
chances are we'll be in the ground

32:45.772 --> 32:47.372
and I'd hate to think
you spent the last of it

32:47.541 --> 32:50.142
slaving over a kitchen
sink cleaning out sheep guts

32:50.209 --> 32:52.344
for other people's good times.

32:53.847 --> 32:56.314
Let's go.

32:56.450 --> 32:58.817
- All right.
- Atta girl. Come on.

33:23.642 --> 33:25.410
Holy shit!

33:25.544 --> 33:27.745
He just walked up and ate the whole camera.

33:27.847 --> 33:29.447
I swear, ate the whole thing. Look.

33:29.582 --> 33:32.050
- How'd he do that?
- Maybe it was a really small camera.

33:32.217 --> 33:34.785
He just ate the cameraman, too.

33:34.987 --> 33:37.288
- This don't make no sense.
- Let's watch it again.

33:37.322 --> 33:38.855
All right, hold on.

33:38.923 --> 33:41.258
Oh, no, that's my last one.

33:41.360 --> 33:43.927
Now, we can either watch this again

33:44.162 --> 33:46.029
or we can go get some of
those good-looking confections

33:46.064 --> 33:47.864
they were selling.

33:47.899 --> 33:49.266
Candy sounds better.

33:49.267 --> 33:50.568
Candy sounds better.

33:52.237 --> 33:54.371
And there we go.

33:54.373 --> 33:55.772
There we go.

33:55.773 --> 33:57.573
Look at this here.

33:59.076 --> 34:00.910
Thank you, Thomas.

34:00.944 --> 34:03.012
You've been a real friend.

34:03.114 --> 34:05.581
Oh, you ever think you'd call me that?

34:05.582 --> 34:07.283
No.

34:07.418 --> 34:10.253
Old Tom Cleary, the maggot ambulance man.

34:10.388 --> 34:12.589
Boyo, the things you used to say to me.

34:12.789 --> 34:15.458
Only because you were
throwing plenty of jabs at me.

34:15.626 --> 34:18.127
Ah, I know it wasn't right
the way I treated you,

34:18.261 --> 34:21.731
but I still don't got no love for nuns.

34:21.732 --> 34:24.100
You...

34:24.199 --> 34:26.569
well, you won over my heart.

34:26.570 --> 34:28.170
Truly.

34:28.237 --> 34:30.239
And I can say the same.

34:32.475 --> 34:35.110
- What are you doing?
- I was kissing you!

34:35.277 --> 34:37.011
- What do you think?
- You're out of your mind.

34:37.112 --> 34:38.780
What was all that talk just then?

34:38.813 --> 34:40.181
Mutual respect is all.

34:40.283 --> 34:42.317
Is this why you brought me out here?

34:42.385 --> 34:44.085
To show me a good time

34:44.286 --> 34:46.655
hoping I'd give you something
back for all that you've done?

34:46.656 --> 34:48.389
Is that why you've done
it all in the first place?

34:48.558 --> 34:50.692
- Was that your game?
- Hey, this isn't a game.

34:50.793 --> 34:53.262
I got feelings for you, Harry.

34:53.429 --> 34:55.764
As much as just said
so as did you about me.

34:55.931 --> 34:59.134
I certainly didn't. You're
what you always were.

34:59.235 --> 35:01.370
I just turned a blind eye to it.

35:01.404 --> 35:02.771
I'm going home.

35:02.972 --> 35:06.540
And I'll thank you to stay
well clear of me in that place.

36:30.891 --> 36:32.726
Jesus.

37:16.469 --> 37:20.706
So, Dr. Gallinger proceeded

37:20.807 --> 37:24.109
with his little eugenics project after all.

37:25.111 --> 37:27.613
How many are there?

37:27.614 --> 37:29.180
52.

37:30.617 --> 37:34.453
All boys between the ages of 15 and 18.

37:34.621 --> 37:38.557
I'm sure you'll agree
with how serious this is.

37:38.725 --> 37:42.627
Dr. Gallinger is clearly
in breach of medical ethics.

37:44.296 --> 37:47.865
These boys were operated on involuntarily.

37:47.900 --> 37:49.767
Involuntarily?

37:50.770 --> 37:52.637
Obviously.

37:52.839 --> 37:55.673
They were too young to
give their informed consent.

37:56.909 --> 37:59.044
Does it say where the
procedures took place?

37:59.145 --> 38:01.512
No. No, I assume they took place

38:01.614 --> 38:03.648
at this so-called Idiot House.

38:06.585 --> 38:08.853
Well, I definitely don't approve.

38:10.522 --> 38:13.123
But it's not illegal

38:13.259 --> 38:15.159
and it didn't happen at the Knick.

38:16.495 --> 38:18.963
So I don't know what I can do about it.

38:59.037 --> 39:01.205
Mrs. Alford,

39:01.306 --> 39:04.708
may I introduce Mr. Dominczyk.

39:07.145 --> 39:09.546
How do you do?

39:09.547 --> 39:11.715
How do you do?

39:14.218 --> 39:18.655
I don't understand why I
cannot look at your girl.

39:18.823 --> 39:22.091
If I had a girl, I would
let you look at her.

39:22.226 --> 39:24.794
As I explained to you, the important things

39:24.929 --> 39:28.264
are her words and the sound of her voice.

39:28.499 --> 39:31.701
Looking at a beautiful woman
would simply distract you

39:31.736 --> 39:33.603
and lessen the effect.

39:35.940 --> 39:38.074
Mr. Dominczyk...

39:40.211 --> 39:42.712
I'm unsure how to begin.

39:42.880 --> 39:45.781
Why don't you tell me
a little about yourself?

39:46.717 --> 39:48.984
I am a steamfitter.

39:49.019 --> 39:50.886
I'm also a drunk.

39:50.888 --> 39:53.822
Yes, well...

39:55.059 --> 39:58.561
Do you... do you drink often?

39:58.595 --> 40:01.330
Every chance I get.

40:01.431 --> 40:03.899
That's what makes me a drunk.

40:05.635 --> 40:08.337
You're right, she has a lovely voice.

40:16.546 --> 40:19.815
Do you remember the first
time you took a drink?

40:22.118 --> 40:23.586
No.

40:23.653 --> 40:26.822
It was when I was a baby.

40:26.990 --> 40:29.925
Your parents were the
first to give you spirits?

40:31.060 --> 40:34.262
My mother would give me whiskey.

40:34.330 --> 40:36.465
She would dip a rag in it

40:36.566 --> 40:39.568
and give it to me to suck.

40:39.669 --> 40:42.504
Why on earth would she do such a thing?

40:42.572 --> 40:45.173
Had to keep me quiet.

40:59.422 --> 41:01.222
Champagne?

41:04.259 --> 41:06.560
What's the occasion?

41:08.196 --> 41:09.797
First a toast.

41:20.275 --> 41:22.176
To surprises.

41:23.045 --> 41:25.779
All right, then.

41:25.780 --> 41:27.413
To surprises.

41:34.823 --> 41:36.263
What are we supposed to do now?

41:36.458 --> 41:39.192
Smash our glasses in the
fireplace like Russians?

41:44.165 --> 41:46.667
Effie.

41:46.668 --> 41:48.135
I'm waiting.

41:48.169 --> 41:49.836
Waiting for what?

41:49.838 --> 41:51.204
My surprise.

41:51.205 --> 41:53.874
What surprise?

41:54.041 --> 41:57.644
Oh, Herman, you never were
one for the grand gesture.

41:57.812 --> 42:01.180
I hate to ruin it for
you, but it's not my fault.

42:01.247 --> 42:04.216
Your man telephoned for you here.

42:05.919 --> 42:07.853
What man?

42:07.921 --> 42:09.855
He didn't tell me his name,

42:09.990 --> 42:12.324
but he told me all about the new house

42:12.493 --> 42:15.861
and the remarkably modern vacuum system.

42:15.929 --> 42:18.898
74th Street.

42:18.899 --> 42:21.000
How stylish.

42:21.001 --> 42:22.935
I see.

42:27.107 --> 42:29.208
Well, Herman,

42:29.209 --> 42:30.976
who is he?

42:31.011 --> 42:33.278
He's an architect.

42:33.346 --> 42:35.748
Formerly in my employ.

42:37.117 --> 42:39.919
When were you planning on telling me?

42:41.421 --> 42:44.123
I suppose now is as good a time as any.

42:46.526 --> 42:50.128
Maybe we can drive round
and see it after dinner.

42:50.130 --> 42:53.031
No. No, Effie.

42:53.099 --> 42:55.133
You need never see the house.

42:58.905 --> 43:01.940
What are you talking
about? Why on earth not?

43:02.042 --> 43:04.843
Because...

43:04.977 --> 43:07.312
I intend to live in it with another woman.

43:10.417 --> 43:13.752
I've also taken the liberty
of selling this house.

43:13.886 --> 43:15.587
You may stay through the end of the week,

43:15.588 --> 43:17.723
but then you and the children must go.

43:17.823 --> 43:21.092
I've rented you an apartment downtown.

43:21.161 --> 43:23.128
Two bedrooms in a walk-up.

43:25.998 --> 43:28.833
Was that a grand enough gesture for you?

43:48.754 --> 43:50.554
For Christ's sake.

46:19.802 --> 46:23.204
Mrs. Alford, it's time.

46:31.814 --> 46:33.748
Ready?

46:33.816 --> 46:35.951
To look like me again.

46:35.952 --> 46:37.618
Bertie.

46:58.173 --> 47:00.174
Doctor, I have no pulse.

47:02.210 --> 47:04.512
Dilated. She's having a reaction.

47:04.513 --> 47:06.713
Drop the table.

47:08.950 --> 47:11.251
Three, two, one.

47:15.657 --> 47:17.391
Bertie, brandy and strychnine.

47:17.458 --> 47:19.426
Still no pulse.

47:19.460 --> 47:21.528
Lucy, pump her arms.

47:33.740 --> 47:35.608
Take over.

47:43.250 --> 47:44.918
Anything?

47:44.919 --> 47:46.552
No, nothing.

47:49.089 --> 47:51.656
What are you doing? What are you doing?

47:51.691 --> 47:53.525
Limiting circulation.

47:53.592 --> 47:56.061
Reducing pressure on her heart.

48:46.078 --> 48:48.279
Take the tube out of her mouth.

49:17.307 --> 49:19.007
Yes?

49:28.285 --> 49:30.486
Do you still want me to leave tomorrow?

49:35.025 --> 49:37.025
No.
