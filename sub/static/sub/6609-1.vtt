01:09.803 --> 01:12.897
There are over
550 million firearms

01:12.973 --> 01:15.271
in worldwide circulation.

01:15.342 --> 01:19.608
That's one firearm for every
12 people on the planet.

01:19.680 --> 01:21.773
The only question is...

01:24.351 --> 01:27.411
how do we arm
the other 11?

04:34.541 --> 04:36.475
<i>You don't have to worry.</i>

04:36.543 --> 04:39.671
<i>I'm not gonna tell you
a pack of lies to make me look good.</i>

04:39.747 --> 04:42.341
<i>I'm just gonna tell you
what happened.</i>

04:42.416 --> 04:44.350
<i>- My name is Yuri Orlov.</i>

04:44.418 --> 04:47.546
<i>When I was a boy,
my family came to America,</i>

04:47.621 --> 04:49.555
<i>but not all the way.</i>

04:49.623 --> 04:53.286
<i>Like most Ukrainians,
we congregated in Brighton Beach.</i>

04:53.360 --> 04:55.760
<i>It reminded us
of the Black Sea.</i>

04:55.829 --> 04:58.992
<i>I soon realized we just swapped
one hell for another.</i>

04:59.066 --> 05:01.034
<i>Even in hell,</i>

05:01.101 --> 05:04.332
<i>an angel sometimes
makes an appearance.</i>

05:04.405 --> 05:07.374
<i>I'd worshipped Ava Fontaine
since I was 10 years old.</i>

05:07.441 --> 05:11.377
<i>Of course,
she didn't know I existed.</i>

05:11.445 --> 05:14.608
<i>I was starting to think
she had a point.</i>

05:17.351 --> 05:19.819
<i>For the first 20-odd years
of my life,</i>

05:19.887 --> 05:23.823
<i>Little Odessa was to me
what it is to the Q train.</i>

05:23.891 --> 05:25.825
<i>The end of the line.</i>

05:27.027 --> 05:29.825
<i>Oh, I did lie about my name.</i>

05:29.897 --> 05:31.865
<i>It's not really Yuri Orlov.</i>

05:31.932 --> 05:34.093
<i>There have been few occasions
in the 20th Century</i>

05:34.168 --> 05:36.636
<i>when it's been an advantage
to be a Jew.</i>

05:36.703 --> 05:39.137
<i>But in the '70s to escape
the Soviet Union,</i>

05:39.206 --> 05:41.367
<i>our family pretended
to be Jewish.</i>

05:41.442 --> 05:44.377
<i>Little about my life
has been kosher ever since.</i>

05:44.445 --> 05:47.073
How's it going, brother?

05:47.147 --> 05:48.546
It's not.

05:48.615 --> 05:50.549
<i>Yuri: That's Vitaly,
my younger brother.</i>

05:50.617 --> 05:53.245
<i>He was a lost as me.
He just didn't know it yet.</i>

05:53.320 --> 05:56.312
Yuri, you're late.

05:59.393 --> 06:02.692
<i>My father took his assumed
identity to heart.</i>

06:02.763 --> 06:04.697
<i>He was more Jewish
than most Jews,</i>

06:04.765 --> 06:07.097
<i>which drove my
Catholic mother crazy.</i>

06:07.167 --> 06:10.534
How many times?
I can't eat shellfish.

06:10.604 --> 06:12.902
- It's trayf.
- You're not Jewish.

06:12.973 --> 06:15.100
I like it.

06:15.175 --> 06:17.302
I like the hat...

06:17.377 --> 06:21.609
to remind us there is
something above us.

06:21.682 --> 06:23.650
I like that.

06:26.086 --> 06:28.179
- I'm going to temple.
- You're not going to temple.

06:28.255 --> 06:30.519
You go to temple
more than the rabbi.

06:34.294 --> 06:37.422
Yuri, don't forget
to check the specials

06:37.498 --> 06:39.398
at the Palace.

06:39.466 --> 06:41.798
<i>Yuri:
Growing up in Little Odessa,</i>

06:41.869 --> 06:44.064
<i>murder was an everyday
part of life.</i>

06:44.137 --> 06:47.937
<i>Russian mobsters had also
migrated from the Soviet Union.</i>

06:48.008 --> 06:51.307
<i>And when they came to America,
their baggage came with them.</i>

06:53.113 --> 06:56.014
<i>There was always some gangster
getting whacked in my neighborhood.</i>

06:56.083 --> 06:58.142
<i>But I'd never seen it
with my own eyes.</i>

06:58.218 --> 07:01.654
<i>I had this knack of showing up
five minutes before something went down,</i>

07:01.722 --> 07:03.553
<i>or five minutes after.</i>

07:03.624 --> 07:05.922
<i>Not that day.</i>

07:28.148 --> 07:30.309
<i>It hit me.</i>

07:30.384 --> 07:33.581
<i>It couldn't have hit me harder
if I was the one who'd been shot.</i>

07:33.654 --> 07:36.714
<i>You go into the restaurant
business because people are always</i>

07:36.790 --> 07:39.054
<i>going to have to eat.</i>

07:39.126 --> 07:43.825
<i>That was the day I realized my destiny
lay in fulfilling another basic human need.</i>

07:47.401 --> 07:50.302
<i>The next Sabbath,
I went to temple with my father.</i>

07:50.370 --> 07:53.931
<i>However, it wasn't God
I was trying to get close to.</i>

07:54.007 --> 07:55.941
Eli, my oldest son Yuri.

07:56.009 --> 07:57.670
<i>My contact at synagogue</i>

07:57.744 --> 08:02.204
<i>landed me my first Israeli-made
Uzi submachine guns.</i>

08:05.819 --> 08:09.084
<i>The first time you sell a gun
is a lot like the first time you have sex.</i>

08:09.156 --> 08:11.920
<i>You have absolutely no idea
what you're doing.</i>

08:11.992 --> 08:14.688
<i>But it is exciting,
and one way or another,</i>

08:14.761 --> 08:16.524
<i>it's over way too fast.</i>

08:19.266 --> 08:23.168
Gentlemen, the new Uzi
machine pistol...

08:23.236 --> 08:25.033
big firepower
in a small package.

08:25.105 --> 08:27.300
This little baby uses
9mm hollowpoints,

08:27.374 --> 08:29.205
2025-round extendable mags,

08:29.276 --> 08:30.971
rear-flip adjustable sights.

08:31.044 --> 08:33.534
Silencer comes standard.
Excellent recoil reduction.

08:33.614 --> 08:36.582
Muzzle jump reduced 40%,
60% improved noise suppression.

08:36.650 --> 08:39.174
You could pump a mag
into me right now

08:39.251 --> 08:41.686
and never wake the guy
in the next room.

08:42.923 --> 08:46.654
Of course that would eliminate
your opportunity for repeat business.

08:48.295 --> 08:51.492
<i>Yuri: I did have a natural instinct
for smuggling contraband.</i>

08:51.565 --> 08:56.127
<i>Fortunately, back then a video camera
was as big as a bazooka.</i>

09:03.777 --> 09:06.678
<i>Here, I'd been running away
from violence my whole life,</i>

09:06.747 --> 09:08.942
<i>and I should have been
running towards it.</i>

09:09.016 --> 09:11.007
<i>It's in our nature.</i>

09:11.084 --> 09:15.350
<i>The earliest human skeletons
had spearheads in their ribcages.</i>

09:26.066 --> 09:29.729
Where have you been?
What if we had a customer?

09:29.803 --> 09:32.237
God bless America.

09:45.886 --> 09:49.083
- Mm, mm-hmm. (gags)
- Yeah?

09:54.027 --> 09:55.961
"Beware of the dog"?

09:56.029 --> 09:58.020
You don't have a dog.
Are you trying to scare people?

09:58.098 --> 10:00.259
No, it's to scare me.

10:00.333 --> 10:02.801
Remind me to be aware
of the dog in me.

10:02.869 --> 10:05.099
The dog that wants
to fuck everything that moves,

10:05.172 --> 10:07.231
wants to fight and kill
weaker dogs.

10:07.307 --> 10:10.765
I guess it's to remind me
to be more human.

10:10.844 --> 10:12.778
Isn't being a dog
part of being human?

10:12.846 --> 10:17.010
What if that's the best part
of you, the dog part?

10:17.084 --> 10:19.348
What if you're really
just a two-legged dog?

10:21.421 --> 10:24.015
You need to see somebody.

10:24.091 --> 10:26.355
It stinks in here.

10:26.426 --> 10:29.020
<i>Yuri: I'd always wanted to do
something big with my life.</i>

10:29.096 --> 10:31.030
<i>I just didn't know what.</i>

10:31.098 --> 10:34.033
<i>Anyhow, I figured if I was
going into the gun trade,</i>

10:34.101 --> 10:35.932
<i>I was going to aim high.</i>

10:36.002 --> 10:38.800
Vitaly, stop fucking around.
I want to talk to you.

10:42.642 --> 10:44.473
You read the newspapers, V?

10:44.544 --> 10:46.409
The newspaper?

10:46.480 --> 10:48.004
It's always the same.

10:48.081 --> 10:51.881
You're right. Every day there's
people shooting each other.

10:51.952 --> 10:53.613
You know what I do
when I see that?

10:53.687 --> 10:55.712
<i>I look to see what guns
they're using,</i>

10:55.789 --> 10:57.484
and I think to myself,
why not my guns?

10:57.557 --> 10:58.990
What, you opening
a gun shop?

10:59.059 --> 11:01.254
Already more of those
in America than McDonald's.

11:01.328 --> 11:03.421
Even with all the gangsters
around here,

11:03.497 --> 11:05.397
the margins are too low.

11:05.465 --> 11:07.956
<i>- You've worked out the margins?
- Sure.</i>

11:08.034 --> 11:10.468
Forget gang wars.

11:10.537 --> 11:14.530
The real money's
in actual wars between countries.

11:14.608 --> 11:18.135
Yuri, what the fuck
do you know about guns?

11:18.211 --> 11:20.771
I know which end
I'd rather be on.

11:22.682 --> 11:26.345
I made the first sale.
We're already in business.

11:27.821 --> 11:30.517
Whoa. We?

11:30.590 --> 11:32.683
I need a partner.

11:35.262 --> 11:36.524
I don't know.

11:36.596 --> 11:39.224
Uh, I don't know, Yuri.
I don't know.

11:39.299 --> 11:42.427
<i>Vitaly, I've tasted your borscht.
You're no fucking chef.</i>

11:42.502 --> 11:44.732
I can eat in the restaurant
for free, and I still don't eat there.

11:44.805 --> 11:46.534
Fuck you.

11:46.606 --> 11:48.870
We're doing nothing
with our lives.

11:50.811 --> 11:55.077
I mean, this is shit.
This is shit.

11:55.148 --> 11:59.278
That's true.

11:59.352 --> 12:01.582
But maybe doing nothing's
better than doing this.

12:05.926 --> 12:07.894
I need you.

12:07.961 --> 12:09.929
(speaking Russian)

12:30.584 --> 12:34.850
Sir, sir, may I interest you
in the shoulder-fired SA-7

12:34.921 --> 12:37.788
surface-to-air missile?
It's the older Chinese model.

12:37.858 --> 12:40.224
Not so effective
against modern military aircraft,

12:40.293 --> 12:42.727
<i>but deadly if used
against a commercial airliner.</i>

12:42.796 --> 12:44.923
<i>Giving them away at 850.</i>

12:46.900 --> 12:49.733
<i>Yuri: It was the '80s, and the Cold War
was far from thawed.</i>

12:49.803 --> 12:52.169
<i>Most of the deals were
government to government.</i>

12:52.239 --> 12:56.505
<i>It was a mostly private club
with a lifetime club president.</i>

12:56.576 --> 12:59.272
- That's him.
- Who, the big shot?

12:59.346 --> 13:00.973
Simeon Weisz.

13:01.047 --> 13:05.245
Angola, Mozambique,
those Exocet missiles in the Falklands.

13:05.318 --> 13:08.082
He was selling guns
before there was gunpowder.

13:08.154 --> 13:10.122
I'll be right back.

13:13.159 --> 13:16.458
Mr. Weisz. Mr. Weisz.

13:16.529 --> 13:19.123
It's okay. They're talking.

13:19.199 --> 13:22.032
- May I help?
- Yes, a mutual friend, Eli Kurtzman,

13:22.102 --> 13:25.435
from Brighton Beach, import, exports,
said to contact you.

13:25.505 --> 13:27.166
I have a business proposal,

13:27.240 --> 13:29.174
and I thought perhaps
we could discuss it.

13:29.242 --> 13:32.541
I don't think you and I
are in the same business.

13:32.612 --> 13:35.308
You think I just sell guns,
don't you?

13:35.382 --> 13:37.782
I don't. I take sides.

13:37.851 --> 13:41.218
But in the Iran-lraq war,
you sold guns to both sides.

13:41.288 --> 13:46.191
Did you ever consider that I
wanted both sides to lose?

13:46.259 --> 13:49.285
Bullets change governments
far surer than votes.

13:49.362 --> 13:52.661
You're in the wrong place,
my young friend.

13:52.732 --> 13:55.360
This is no place
for amateurs.

14:00.707 --> 14:02.937
<i>Yuri: Curious how you always revert
to your native tongue in moments</i>

14:03.009 --> 14:06.706
<i>- of extreme anger and ecstasy.</i>

14:18.825 --> 14:22.761
- Oh, you are beautiful.

14:22.829 --> 14:25.320
<i>What's your name again?</i>

14:26.900 --> 14:29.835
(man on TV speaking
foreign language)

14:29.903 --> 14:31.894
<i>Yuri:
The only option for Vitaly and me</i>

14:31.972 --> 14:34.236
<i>was under the counter gun running.</i>

14:35.976 --> 14:39.707
<i>I got my first break in Lebanon
after the suicide bombing.</i>

14:42.048 --> 14:45.279
<i>But I wasn't the only
local kid making good.</i>

14:49.289 --> 14:51.223
<i>When the United States
leaves a war zone,</i>

14:51.291 --> 14:53.350
<i>they generally don't take
their munitions.</i>

14:53.426 --> 14:57.556
<i>It costs more to bring it back
than to buy new stock.</i>

14:57.630 --> 15:01.396
So we sell by the kilo.

15:01.468 --> 15:05.768
They're secondhand weapons,
but they're still okay.

15:05.839 --> 15:08.967
How many kilos
would you like?

15:09.042 --> 15:12.478
<i>- 5,000.
- Yuri: I had a flair for languages.</i>

15:12.545 --> 15:15.605
<i>But I soon discovered that
what talks best is dollars,</i>

15:15.682 --> 15:18.981
<i>dinars, drachmas, rubles,
rupees and pounds fucking sterling.</i>

15:19.052 --> 15:22.317
<i>Of course, the US Army
got a piece of the action.</i>

15:22.389 --> 15:25.756
<i>Army salaries were no better
in the '80s than they are today.</i>

15:25.825 --> 15:29.591
<i>And some of the brass,
like Lieutenant Colonel Southern</i>

15:29.662 --> 15:31.960
<i>needed to raise money
for their own private wars.</i>

15:32.032 --> 15:34.227
Good to make
your acquaintance.

15:34.300 --> 15:38.031
This is bullshit money, V.
This is small fucking potatoes.

15:38.104 --> 15:40.038
What do you want to go,
go more legit?

15:40.106 --> 15:42.666
No, more illegal.

15:42.742 --> 15:45.939
What I would give right now
for a plate of cabbage and potatoes.

16:12.338 --> 16:14.306
It's not our fight.

16:15.608 --> 16:17.542
V, come on.

16:17.610 --> 16:20.340
Let's go. Come on.

16:31.691 --> 16:34.182
<i>Yuri: Selling guns is like
selling vacuum cleaners.</i>

16:34.260 --> 16:37.058
<i>You make calls,
pound the pavement, take orders.</i>

16:37.130 --> 16:39.724
<i>I was an equal opportunity
merchant of death.</i>

16:39.799 --> 16:42.461
<i>I supplied every army
but the Salvation Army.</i>

16:44.771 --> 16:48.138
<i>I sold Israeli-made Uzis
to Muslims.</i>

16:53.746 --> 16:56.214
<i>I sold communist-made
bullets to fascists.</i>

16:56.282 --> 16:58.250
(speaking Chinese)

17:11.931 --> 17:14.365
<i>I even shipped cargo
to Afghanistan</i>

17:14.434 --> 17:17.597
<i>when they were fighting
my fellow Soviets.</i>

17:17.670 --> 17:20.036
<i>I never sold
to Osama bin Laden.</i>

17:20.106 --> 17:24.702
<i>Not on any moral grounds. Back then
he was always bouncing checks.</i>

17:33.419 --> 17:36.718
<i>By the mid '80s,
my weapons were represented</i>

17:36.789 --> 17:39.553
<i>in eight of the world's
top 10 war zones.</i>

18:08.154 --> 18:10.418
<i>There's no problem leading
a double life.</i>

18:10.490 --> 18:13.288
<i>It's the triple and quadruples lives
that get you in the end.</i>

18:13.359 --> 18:16.487
<i>Back then I carried
a French, British, Israeli</i>

18:16.563 --> 18:19.828
<i>and Ukrainian passport
and a student visa for the US.</i>

18:19.899 --> 18:23.562
<i>But that's another story.
I also packed six different briefcases,</i>

18:23.636 --> 18:26.127
<i>depending on who I was
that day and the region</i>

18:26.206 --> 18:28.174
<i>of the world I was visiting.</i>

18:32.712 --> 18:34.805
<i>Without operations like mine,</i>

18:34.881 --> 18:36.872
<i>it would be impossible
for certain countries</i>

18:36.950 --> 18:39.475
<i>to conduct
a respectable war.</i>

18:39.552 --> 18:43.716
<i>I was able to navigate around
those inconvenient little arms embargoes.</i>

18:43.790 --> 18:46.384
<i>There are three basic types
of arms deal.</i>

18:46.459 --> 18:49.121
<i>White being legal,
black being illegal</i>

18:49.195 --> 18:51.857
<i>and my personal
favorite color gray.</i>

18:51.931 --> 18:54.798
<i>Sometimes I made the deals
so convoluted,</i>

18:54.867 --> 18:56.801
<i>it was hard for me to work out
if they were on the level.</i>

18:56.869 --> 19:01.101
<i>To keep authorities in the dark,
I often spoke in code.</i>

19:01.174 --> 19:03.972
<i>Rocket launchers were "mothers,"
the rockets..."children."</i>

19:04.043 --> 19:07.240
<i>The AK-47 assault rifle
was the "angel king."</i>

19:07.313 --> 19:09.543
It's Yuri.

19:09.616 --> 19:13.074
Yeah, well, yeah, Raoul...

19:13.152 --> 19:16.849
Raoul, the angel king
will arrive tomorrow.

19:16.923 --> 19:19.448
Hallelujah to you too.
All right.

19:19.525 --> 19:22.187
<i>The point is if I've done
my job right,</i>

19:22.262 --> 19:25.163
<i>an arms embargo should
be practically impossible</i>

19:25.231 --> 19:26.630
<i>- to enforce.
- (telephone rings)</i>

19:26.699 --> 19:31.398
What?
Okay, just slow the fuck down.

19:31.471 --> 19:34.235
I can't understand you.
What?

19:34.307 --> 19:37.299
What do you mean tipped off?
They know where we are?

19:37.377 --> 19:40.642
Well, where are they?
Well, how long have I got?

19:40.713 --> 19:43.773
Not long,
what does that mean? Shit.

19:43.850 --> 19:46.045
- Do we try to lose them?
- On this?

19:46.119 --> 19:49.350
- Yuri, we have to get off this thing.
- No, no one's going anywhere. Slow.

19:49.422 --> 19:52.550
Dead slow. Buy me time.

19:54.460 --> 19:57.554
Yeah, it's Yuri.
Get that fucking rag down!

19:57.630 --> 19:59.689
I need another handle
for this tub.

19:59.766 --> 20:01.859
Something in our weight class.

20:01.934 --> 20:05.734
You, over the side.
We're changing the name. Now!

20:07.774 --> 20:09.173
Yes, it's gotta check out.

20:09.242 --> 20:12.109
<i>Yuri: The way I look at it.
What's in a name?</i>

20:12.178 --> 20:13.611
Have you got a shorter name?

20:13.680 --> 20:16.706
<i>I'd often change the registration
of the ship or a plane.</i>

20:16.783 --> 20:19.547
<i>But never at such
short notice.</i>

20:22.789 --> 20:25.019
Damn, they're hauling.

20:25.091 --> 20:28.993
What? "Kono."
How do you spell that? K-o-n-o.

20:29.062 --> 20:30.927
Okay, well, that's good.
Kono.

20:30.997 --> 20:33.056
K-o-n-o.

20:33.132 --> 20:35.191
What are we flying?
Dutch. Got it.

20:35.268 --> 20:37.361
V, get me a Dutch flag,
would you?

20:47.814 --> 20:50.214
Faster or I'll send
your ass in!

20:50.283 --> 20:52.547
Yuri, I don't have Dutch.

20:52.618 --> 20:54.085
- What?
- I've got Belgium.

20:54.153 --> 20:55.711
What the fuck use is that?
He's painting a name

20:55.788 --> 20:59.121
registered in
the fucking Netherlands.

20:59.192 --> 21:01.558
- I've got a French flag.
- So?

21:01.627 --> 21:03.652
Turn it sideways...

21:03.730 --> 21:06.255
it's Dutch. (laughs)

21:06.332 --> 21:08.300
That's why you're my brother.

21:30.823 --> 21:33.758
All right, good.
Everybody look innocent now.

21:43.403 --> 21:45.667
<i>Yuri: They say every man
has his price.</i>

21:45.738 --> 21:47.763
<i>But not every man gets it.</i>

21:47.840 --> 21:50.400
<i>Interpol agent Jack Valentine
couldn't be bought,</i>

21:50.476 --> 21:52.444
<i>at least not with money.</i>

21:52.512 --> 21:54.980
<i>For Jack,
glory was the prize.</i>

21:55.047 --> 21:58.210
Yeah, it's the Kono.
It's not the Kristol.

21:58.284 --> 22:00.479
Kono. K-o-n-o.

22:00.553 --> 22:03.044
<i>- It's clean, sir.
- It's clean?</i>

22:03.122 --> 22:06.057
<i>Sure doesn't look clean.</i>

22:06.125 --> 22:07.456
I'm gonna go aboard.

22:07.527 --> 22:10.428
Phone in a sighting
of the Kristol south of Aruba.

22:16.602 --> 22:20.197
<i>Yuri: Even when I was up against
an overzealous agent,</i>

22:20.273 --> 22:23.299
<i>I had a number of methods
for discouraging a search.</i>

22:23.376 --> 22:27.142
<i>I routinely mislabeled
my arms shipments "farm machinery."</i>

22:27.213 --> 22:30.376
<i>And I have yet to meet
the lowly paid customs official</i>

22:30.450 --> 22:33.078
<i>who will open a container
marked "radioactive waste"</i>

22:33.152 --> 22:36.144
<i>to verify its contents,</i>

22:36.222 --> 22:38.156
<i>but my personal favorite
is the unique combination</i>

22:38.224 --> 22:41.660
<i>of week-old potatoes
and tropical heat.</i>

22:49.435 --> 22:52.495
(insects buzzing)

22:56.075 --> 22:58.873
It smells.

22:58.945 --> 23:02.676
Sir, sighting of the Kristol
due north.

23:02.748 --> 23:06.582
<i>Most importantly, I kept a number
of intelligence people</i>

23:06.652 --> 23:08.586
<i>on the payroll to supply
their colleagues</i>

23:08.654 --> 23:10.121
<i>with counterintelligence.</i>

23:10.189 --> 23:11.713
Let's go.

23:23.669 --> 23:26.968
<i>The second rule of gun-running
is always ensure</i>

23:27.039 --> 23:28.973
<i>you have a foolproof way
to get paid.</i>

23:29.041 --> 23:32.875
<i>Preferably in advance,
ideally to an offshore account.</i>

23:32.945 --> 23:35.311
<i>That's why I chose
my customers so carefully.</i>

23:35.381 --> 23:37.906
<i>Say what you like
about warlords and dictators.</i>

23:37.984 --> 23:40.646
<i>They tend to have
a highly developed sense of order.</i>

23:40.720 --> 23:42.915
<i>They always pay their bills
on time.</i>

23:42.989 --> 23:44.957
(speaking Spanish)

24:05.378 --> 24:07.346
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa...

24:16.856 --> 24:17.914
What the fuck are you doing?

24:17.990 --> 24:19.855
- Fuck you!
- Fuck you!

24:24.330 --> 24:26.298
(screams)
No, V.

24:28.968 --> 24:30.458
Shit.

24:30.536 --> 24:34.233
<i>The first and most important rule
of gunrunning</i>

24:34.307 --> 24:37.640
<i>is never get shot
with your own merchandise.</i>

24:37.977 --> 24:40.445
You okay?

24:40.513 --> 24:42.378
I think so.

24:42.448 --> 24:45.713
<i>- So what do we do now?
- Let's celebrate.</i>

25:03.102 --> 25:05.229
- God.

25:09.642 --> 25:12.167
<i>That narco-guerilla
had his facts right.</i>

25:12.244 --> 25:14.678
<i>After shipping it stateside,
the return on that blow</i>

25:14.747 --> 25:16.681
<i>netted me a healthy profit.</i>

25:16.749 --> 25:19.684
<i>It would have been better,
except one kilo never made it back.</i>

25:19.752 --> 25:21.686
Vitaly.

25:21.754 --> 25:23.722
Vit.

25:27.393 --> 25:31.329
<i>To this day, I don't know what
Vitaly was running away from.</i>

25:31.397 --> 25:34.389
<i>Maybe just from Vitaly.</i>

25:34.467 --> 25:37.402
<i>I found him 12 days,
2,000 miles</i>

25:37.470 --> 25:40.439
<i>and 150 grams later
in a Bolivian boarding house.</i>

25:44.310 --> 25:48.542
<i>Of course, my dream girl
had gotten there before me.</i>

25:54.086 --> 25:56.054
V.

26:06.499 --> 26:09.297
<i>- Come on.</i>

26:22.815 --> 26:27.718
Yuri.
It's my brother Yuri.

26:27.787 --> 26:29.914
He's my big brother.

26:29.989 --> 26:32.583
What the fuck is that?

26:32.658 --> 26:35.456
Ukraine. I was young.

26:35.528 --> 26:37.928
But I remember. Look.

26:37.997 --> 26:40.022
I start in Odessa, right?

26:40.099 --> 26:42.567
And then I work my way
to the Crimean.

26:42.635 --> 26:45.069
You're gonna be dead
before you fucking reach Kiev.

26:45.137 --> 26:47.867
- Come on, we're going home.
- You fuck!

26:47.940 --> 26:51.967
You fucking fuck!
You fucking fuck!

26:52.044 --> 26:54.569
What the fuck
is your problem?

26:54.647 --> 26:57.514
(snorting)

27:00.720 --> 27:03.814
Come on, Vit.

27:03.889 --> 27:06.824
It's so nice to be home.

27:06.892 --> 27:08.985
Yeah, we're... we're gonna get
you home.

27:09.061 --> 27:10.926
Come on.

27:19.472 --> 27:22.270
(sighs)
Get out of the car.

27:26.779 --> 27:29.373
Vitaly, I need you
to get out of the car.

27:30.983 --> 27:34.180
I promised our parents.

27:34.253 --> 27:35.686
Please.

27:35.755 --> 27:38.315
Vitaly, you're gonna have
a great time. This is a top place.

27:38.390 --> 27:40.324
Two Ford models
checked in last week.

27:40.392 --> 27:42.383
And that cute weathergirl's
been here since July.

27:42.461 --> 27:45.794
Please, please.

27:45.865 --> 27:48.265
Please, Yuri.

27:56.542 --> 27:58.806
(snorting)

28:04.483 --> 28:07.281
You're a good brother.

28:08.988 --> 28:10.979
- Okay.
- You're a good brother, Yuri.

28:11.056 --> 28:13.217
- Okay, all right.
- Good brother.

28:13.292 --> 28:16.784
All right,
get out of the car. Okay.

28:16.862 --> 28:18.830
Get out of the car.

28:25.771 --> 28:27.932
<i>Yuri: From then on,
I was a one-man operation.</i>

28:28.007 --> 28:31.909
<i>I never understood what separated
the recreational drug user</i>

28:31.977 --> 28:34.878
<i>from the habitual,
but for the grace of God,</i>

28:34.947 --> 28:37.677
<i>it could have been me snorting
lines as long as the Belt Parkway.</i>

28:37.750 --> 28:42.653
<i>However, I wasn't entirely
free of the grip of addiction myself.</i>

28:42.721 --> 28:44.518
<i>There she was again.</i>

28:44.590 --> 28:46.023
<i>Ava Fontaine.</i>

28:46.091 --> 28:48.787
<i>In my neighborhood,
they say "The good get out."</i>

28:48.861 --> 28:52.024
<i>In our own ways,
we both conquered the world.</i>

29:07.980 --> 29:10.778
<i>You can't force someone
to fall in love with you.</i>

29:10.850 --> 29:14.217
<i>But you can definitely
improve your odds.</i>

29:14.286 --> 29:17.153
<i>It cost me 20 grand
to book her for a fake photo shoot.</i>

29:17.223 --> 29:19.214
<i>Another 12 to buy out
the hotel.</i>

30:03.102 --> 30:05.070
It's a popular hotel, huh?

30:09.141 --> 30:11.200
- Ava Fontaine.
- Yuri Orlov.

30:11.277 --> 30:13.006
What brings you to St. Bart's?

30:13.078 --> 30:15.808
Photo shoot.
At least that was the plan.

30:15.881 --> 30:18.509
Guess the photographer
got stuck in Miami.

30:18.584 --> 30:21.610
Hurricane, though there's nothing
on the news.

30:21.687 --> 30:25.088
Those things can come
out of nowhere.

30:25.157 --> 30:27.887
So, the job's been canceled,

30:27.960 --> 30:30.690
and wouldn't you know it, there's no flight
back to New York until Tuesday.

30:30.763 --> 30:33.857
You can hitch a ride with me if you like.
I'm leaving tomorrow.

30:33.933 --> 30:37.630
Meanwhile, why don't I
take your picture?

30:39.171 --> 30:42.299
<i>Yuri: In my experience, some
of the most successful relationships</i>

30:42.374 --> 30:44.342
<i>are based on lies and deceit.</i>

30:44.410 --> 30:46.537
<i>Since that's where they
usually end up anyway,</i>

30:46.612 --> 30:48.307
<i>it's a logical place to start.</i>

30:48.380 --> 30:50.211
Right there. Right there.
Hold it.

30:50.282 --> 30:52.512
Oh my God!

30:55.254 --> 30:58.951
<i>Yuri: I nearly went broke trying
to convince her I was anything but.</i>

31:00.659 --> 31:02.923
<i>I knew Ava was not the kind
of woman to be seduced</i>

31:02.995 --> 31:05.896
<i>by a ride in a private jet
unless you owned the jet.</i>

31:05.965 --> 31:07.865
This is your plane?

31:07.933 --> 31:09.730
That is my name.

31:09.802 --> 31:11.394
<i>Yuri:
Of course I was lying.</i>

31:11.470 --> 31:15.167
<i>The plane was a rental like the car
and even the suit I was standing in.</i>

31:15.240 --> 31:17.834
<i>At the last minute I bribed
the crew for the paint job.</i>

31:17.910 --> 31:20.310
<i>Luckily by the time we landed</i>

31:20.379 --> 31:23.712
<i>Ava wasn't looking anywhere
but in my eyes.</i>

31:23.782 --> 31:25.750
I had no idea.

31:25.818 --> 31:28.878
<i>I'm sorry I didn't recognize you.</i>

31:28.954 --> 31:32.048
Don't apologize.
I put clothes on for a living.

31:32.124 --> 31:34.115
Well at least you're not
taking them off.

31:34.193 --> 31:36.957
I would be if half the photographers
had their way.

31:37.029 --> 31:38.894
What about you?

31:38.964 --> 31:40.454
I'm in transport.

31:40.532 --> 31:42.727
International air freight mostly.

31:42.801 --> 31:44.769
Business is good.

31:44.837 --> 31:47.237
Where are you from?

31:47.306 --> 31:49.740
I was born in Ukraine
but I grew up in Brooklyn.

31:49.808 --> 31:51.366
- No.
- What, you too?

31:51.443 --> 31:52.637
Williamsburg.

31:56.815 --> 31:58.544
Well, here's to a hurricane.

31:59.852 --> 32:02.150
Without it I never
would have met you.

32:03.188 --> 32:06.123
This is no accident, is it, Yuri?

32:09.995 --> 32:11.963
It feels like fate.

32:12.031 --> 32:14.932
I don't believe in fate.

32:15.000 --> 32:17.264
What do you believe in?

32:59.711 --> 33:01.611
Is that a view or is that a view?

33:01.680 --> 33:03.944
That's a view.

33:14.493 --> 33:16.518
Thank you.
Thank you all.

33:20.599 --> 33:22.658
- Mazel tov.
- Congratulations.

33:22.734 --> 33:24.361
Thanks.

33:26.538 --> 33:29.507
Always remember, son,
there's something above you.

33:29.575 --> 33:33.511
Sure, Dad.
A $40,000 crystal chandelier.

33:33.579 --> 33:36.241
(laughs)

33:36.315 --> 33:38.374
Make yourselves at home.

33:38.450 --> 33:40.441
Go. Go!

33:54.500 --> 33:57.367
I'm sorry.
Today must be tough.

33:58.570 --> 34:02.131
Be nice to have a couple more guests
from my side of the family.

34:02.207 --> 34:04.402
I'm sure they're watching right now.

34:04.476 --> 34:06.706
Thank you.

34:06.778 --> 34:08.905
But you don't believe that, Yuri.

34:08.981 --> 34:10.949
Remember?

34:12.851 --> 34:14.819
I know you, Yuri.

34:14.887 --> 34:17.583
I know you're not
everything you seem.

34:18.991 --> 34:21.652
Don't worry.
I won't ask a lot of questions.

34:21.726 --> 34:24.389
I don't want to hear you lie.

34:24.463 --> 34:27.431
You take risks.

34:27.498 --> 34:29.330
Just...

34:29.400 --> 34:31.232
promise me you won't risk us.

34:32.371 --> 34:35.704
<i>Yuri: That's the trouble with falling
in love with a dream girl.</i>

34:35.774 --> 34:37.536
<i>They have a habit
of becoming real.</i>

34:43.514 --> 34:46.449
<i>I've never been so glad
to see Vitaly.</i>

34:46.518 --> 34:49.146
- So fucking beautiful!
- Oh!

34:50.188 --> 34:52.248
Brother, brother,
thank you so much

34:52.324 --> 34:54.918
for giving me such
a beautiful sister.

34:54.993 --> 34:57.484
<i>Yuri: He was out of rehab
and out of his mind.</i>

34:57.563 --> 34:59.997
Dance! Dance! Dance!
We have to dance!

35:00.065 --> 35:02.329
- All right.
- It's a wedding. A celebration. To Yuri!

35:02.401 --> 35:05.063
<i>Yuri:
But for once, he rescued me.</i>

35:08.440 --> 35:10.499
<i>I was still living
way beyond my means.</i>

35:10.576 --> 35:14.273
<i>Mortgaged to the hilt, using one
credit card to pay off another.</i>

35:14.346 --> 35:16.610
<i>Anything to keep Ava
in the style to which she had,</i>

35:16.682 --> 35:19.776
<i>thanks largely to me,
become accustomed.</i>

35:19.851 --> 35:22.513
Ava!
Ava this is too much.

35:22.588 --> 35:24.215
Yuri likes to spoil you.

35:24.289 --> 35:26.883
<i>Yuri: Then suddenly
all my Christmases came at once.</i>

35:26.959 --> 35:29.723
Nicki, you did it!
Good boy!

35:29.795 --> 35:32.059
Ha ha!
That's my grandson!

35:32.130 --> 35:34.462
Yuri, don't you want to see
what your son is doing?

35:34.533 --> 35:36.728
<i>Yuri: Whoever said
it's better to give than receive</i>

35:36.802 --> 35:39.066
<i>never got a Christmas present
like the one I got</i>

35:39.137 --> 35:42.231
<i>in 1991 from Mikhail Gorbachev.</i>

35:42.307 --> 35:45.037
- What the hell's the matter?
- It's over! It's over!

35:45.110 --> 35:47.044
- What's over?
- The Cold-fucking-War!

35:47.112 --> 35:49.637
The Soviet-fucking-Union!
The evil fucking empire.

35:49.715 --> 35:51.842
Mikhail's saying "no mas."
He's throwing in the towel.

35:51.917 --> 35:53.885
It's over!

35:57.055 --> 35:59.819
- Your son is walking.
- That's incredible, honey.

36:05.430 --> 36:07.796
At least there'll be religious freedom.

36:07.866 --> 36:10.027
Let's hope so.

36:10.102 --> 36:13.003
I think I'll go back for a visit.

36:13.071 --> 36:15.369
Do you stay in touch
with Uncle Dmitri?

36:18.910 --> 36:21.105
I'm not a fool, Yuri.

36:22.614 --> 36:26.175
I don't think you're going
just to sell Pepsi-Cola.

36:29.888 --> 36:32.516
Is this how you want
to be remembered?

36:32.591 --> 36:34.422
(laughs)

36:34.493 --> 36:36.120
I don't want to be
remembered at all.

36:36.194 --> 36:38.526
If I'm being remembered
it means I'm dead.

36:40.198 --> 36:43.167
Merry fucking Christmas!
(laughing)

36:43.235 --> 36:45.203
Who is this, Vitaly?

36:45.270 --> 36:48.603
- I'm Angel.
- Her name really is Angel.

36:49.641 --> 36:51.438
She's a fairy.

36:53.912 --> 36:56.642
Let's put her on top
of the Christmas tree.

37:02.654 --> 37:05.145
- Vitaly: I love you!
- Come on.

37:05.223 --> 37:07.589
- I love you all.
- (Nicki crying)

37:08.827 --> 37:11.557
Take this.

37:27.646 --> 37:29.739
I'm going back to Ukraine.

37:33.552 --> 37:35.850
I miss Odessa.

37:39.458 --> 37:41.426
(inhales)

37:44.563 --> 37:47.031
- I miss you.
- I miss you.

37:49.968 --> 37:52.732
Be careful, Yuri.
Those things you sell kill.

37:55.607 --> 37:59.304
Inside.

37:59.378 --> 38:01.346
You're high.

38:01.413 --> 38:03.904
Well, that's true.

38:06.952 --> 38:08.715
Hello, Christian.

38:16.294 --> 38:18.592
<i>Yuri: During the Cold War
the Red Army stationed</i>

38:18.663 --> 38:20.597
<i>nearly one million troops
in Ukraine</i>

38:20.665 --> 38:23.225
<i>because of it's strategic
military importance.</i>

38:23.301 --> 38:27.203
<i>The day after The Wall came down
the paychecks stopped coming.</i>

38:27.272 --> 38:28.671
(speaking Russian)

38:28.740 --> 38:30.833
<i>There's nothing better
for an arms dealer</i>

38:30.909 --> 38:32.843
<i>than the combination
of disgruntled soldiers</i>

38:32.911 --> 38:35.175
<i>and warehouses full of weapons.</i>

38:38.183 --> 38:40.845
<i>I was hoping Major General
Dmitri Volkoff</i>

38:40.919 --> 38:44.320
<i>would open a lot of armory doors
in lots of military bases.</i>

38:44.389 --> 38:46.755
<i>For a start, he was family.</i>

38:46.825 --> 38:49.157
<i>He was a highly decorated hero
of the Red Army</i>

38:49.227 --> 38:51.752
<i>and he was almost
permanently shit-faced.</i>

38:51.830 --> 38:55.561
I can't just sell you
government property, Yuri.

38:55.634 --> 38:58.194
I have to report.

38:58.270 --> 39:00.966
Report to who?
Moscow?

39:03.809 --> 39:06.141
As of last week Moscow's
in a foreign country.

39:06.211 --> 39:08.179
New flag, new boss.

39:08.246 --> 39:10.111
There is no new boss yet.

39:10.182 --> 39:12.673
They're all too busy squabbling
over who's gonna get

39:12.751 --> 39:15.219
the presidential holiday home
at the Black Sea.

39:15.287 --> 39:17.221
<i>It's beautiful.</i>

39:17.289 --> 39:20.884
The ones who know don't care anymore
and the ones who care don't know.

39:25.464 --> 39:27.022
Show me your inventory.

39:38.376 --> 39:40.469
<i>Yuri:
Those 45 years of mutual hatred</i>

39:40.545 --> 39:42.604
<i>between the East and the West
had generated</i>

39:42.681 --> 39:45.081
<i>the highest weapons buildup
in history.</i>

39:45.150 --> 39:48.415
<i>The Soviets had guns coming out
of the demon hole.</i>

39:48.487 --> 39:51.081
<i>Huge stockpiles,
and now no enemy.</i>

39:52.257 --> 39:54.350
How many Kalashnikovs
do you have?

39:56.361 --> 39:58.829
40,000.

39:58.897 --> 40:00.626
Is that a four?

40:00.699 --> 40:03.725
Doesn't look like a four to me.
Looks more like a one.

40:03.802 --> 40:05.770
No, it's a four.

40:05.837 --> 40:09.466
It's whatever we say it is because
no one else will know the difference.

40:12.611 --> 40:15.637
10,000 Kalashnikovs
for a battalion.

40:15.714 --> 40:19.115
Your stocks are dangerously
depleted, Dmitri.

40:19.184 --> 40:22.551
You should order more
from the factory.

40:22.621 --> 40:25.590
Someone will work it out.

40:25.657 --> 40:27.124
What happens then?

40:27.192 --> 40:28.750
We'll cut them in.

40:31.763 --> 40:33.856
<i>Yuri: The end of the Cold War
was the beginning</i>

40:33.932 --> 40:35.923
<i>of the hottest time
in arms dealing.</i>

40:36.001 --> 40:38.128
<i>The arms bazaar was open.</i>

40:38.203 --> 40:41.036
<i>Guided missiles,
unguided missiles,</i>

40:41.106 --> 40:43.973
<i>mortars, mines,
armored personnel carriers.</i>

40:44.042 --> 40:45.600
<i>Whole tank divisions.</i>

40:51.116 --> 40:54.279
<i>I even landed a squadron
of helicopter gunships...</i>

41:07.299 --> 41:09.460
<i>the most sophisticated
fighting machines,</i>

41:09.534 --> 41:12.594
<i>built for a war with America
that never happened.</i>

41:18.176 --> 41:21.111
<i>Thanks to me, they'd finally
get to fire a shot in anger.</i>

41:29.621 --> 41:32.988
<i>I have a feeling it wasn't exactly
what comrade Lenin</i>

41:33.058 --> 41:36.619
<i>had in mind when he advocated
the redistribution of wealth.</i>

41:36.695 --> 41:40.722
<i>But I wasn't the only one offering
a crash course in capitalism.</i>

41:42.934 --> 41:44.868
<i>I had rivals.</i>

41:44.936 --> 41:48.337
Inform your commanding officer that
Simeon Weisz is here to meet him.

41:51.476 --> 41:53.341
You don't know who I am, do you?

42:05.423 --> 42:07.186
You're late.

42:07.258 --> 42:09.385
So it appears.

42:22.173 --> 42:24.141
(speaks Russian)

42:34.953 --> 42:37.148
(imitates gunshot)

42:39.224 --> 42:42.660
You look a little lost, Simeon.
Is the world changing too fast?

42:42.727 --> 42:44.661
I'm here, aren't I?

42:44.729 --> 42:46.788
Not all of you, I think.

42:46.865 --> 42:49.333
You've gotten so rich
selling for the CIA

42:49.401 --> 42:52.370
you can't seem to get that ideology
completely out of your head.

42:52.437 --> 42:54.462
Oh, the Cold War had its uses.

42:55.907 --> 42:58.000
Kept attentions frozen.

42:58.076 --> 43:00.670
Now it's harder to determine

43:00.745 --> 43:02.474
which side one's on.

43:02.547 --> 43:04.742
Things have become more complicated.

43:04.816 --> 43:06.511
No, it's gotten simpler.

43:06.584 --> 43:09.985
There's no place in gunrunning
for politics anymore, Simeon.

43:10.055 --> 43:12.080
I sell to leftists and rightists.

43:12.157 --> 43:16.025
I'd sell to pacifists but they're not
the most regular of customers.

43:16.094 --> 43:18.585
Of course you're not
a true internationalist

43:18.663 --> 43:21.427
until you've supplied weapons
to kill your own countrymen.

43:23.968 --> 43:27.199
This current state of chaos
won't last forever.

43:28.373 --> 43:30.773
There'll have to be order.

43:33.078 --> 43:35.273
Instead of cutting
each other's throats,

43:35.346 --> 43:38.941
it may be beneficial if we work together.
What do you think?

43:41.886 --> 43:44.013
What do I think?

43:44.089 --> 43:46.649
I think you're the amateur now.

43:46.725 --> 43:49.193
I think you should go with your instincts.

43:49.260 --> 43:51.592
With your first instinct.

43:51.663 --> 43:54.427
I'm the same man who was not
good enough for you before

43:54.499 --> 43:57.627
and I'm just not good enough
for you now.

44:11.382 --> 44:14.613
The problem with gunrunners
going to war...

44:15.854 --> 44:18.755
is that there's no shortage
of ammunition.

44:21.593 --> 44:25.256
<i>Yuri: This was the chaos
that the Old Guard had always feared.</i>

44:25.330 --> 44:29.232
<i>As far as they were concerned I was
giving arms dealers a bad name.</i>

44:29.300 --> 44:32.599
<i>But then they could hardly report me
to the Better Business Bureau.</i>

44:34.606 --> 44:36.870
<i>And Ukraine
wasn't the only former state</i>

44:36.941 --> 44:39.774
<i>with an unpaid army
and stockpiles of guns.</i>

44:39.844 --> 44:42.506
<i>There was Bulgaria, Hungary,</i>

44:42.580 --> 44:45.014
<i>Poland, Belarus,</i>

44:45.083 --> 44:47.210
<i>all there for the taking.</i>

44:50.889 --> 44:54.017
<i>Of all the weapons
in the vast Soviet arsenal</i>

44:54.092 --> 44:57.584
<i>nothing was more profitable
than Avtomat Kalashnikova,</i>

44:57.662 --> 44:59.527
<i>model of 1947</i>

44:59.597 --> 45:03.431
<i>more commonly known
as the AK-47 or Kalashnikov.</i>

45:03.501 --> 45:06.698
<i>It's the world's
most popular assault rife.</i>

45:06.771 --> 45:08.762
<i>A weapon all fighters love.</i>

45:08.840 --> 45:11.172
<i>An elegantly simple
9- Ib. Amalgamation</i>

45:11.242 --> 45:13.142
<i>of forged steel and plywood.</i>

45:13.211 --> 45:15.771
<i>It doesn't break, jam, or overheat.</i>

45:15.847 --> 45:19.146
<i>It will shoot whether it's covered
in mud or filled with sand.</i>

45:19.217 --> 45:22.880
<i>It's so easy even a child
can use it, and they do.</i>

45:22.954 --> 45:25.047
<i>The Soviets put the gun on a coin.</i>

45:25.123 --> 45:27.421
<i>Mozambique put it on their flag.</i>

45:27.492 --> 45:30.359
<i>Since the end of the Cold War
the Kalashnikov has become</i>

45:30.428 --> 45:32.896
<i>the Russian people's greatest export.</i>

45:32.964 --> 45:36.627
<i>After that comes vodka, caviar
and suicidal novelists.</i>

45:36.701 --> 45:38.965
<i>One thing's for sure.</i>

45:39.037 --> 45:41.562
<i>No one was lining up
to buy their cars.</i>

46:12.036 --> 46:14.470
I thought you were supposed to be
watching out for these people.

46:14.539 --> 46:17.565
How can I?
You keep selling my helicopters.

46:17.642 --> 46:20.076
You are too greedy, Yuri.

46:20.144 --> 46:21.702
I can't hold him forever.

46:21.779 --> 46:24.646
- I've got paperwork.
- Not for the gunships.

46:24.716 --> 46:27.344
You know the penalty
for sanction-busting.

46:27.418 --> 46:30.546
Selling the military helicopter
is a major violation.

46:30.622 --> 46:32.886
Military helicopter.

46:36.361 --> 46:38.329
It's not a military helicopter.

46:38.396 --> 46:40.921
It's a rescue helicopter.

46:40.999 --> 46:42.261
Get to work, son.

46:45.436 --> 46:47.404
The law is on our side.

47:06.391 --> 47:08.825
All right, let me see your papers.

47:08.893 --> 47:12.454
No, no, put that away.
Let's see your papers.

47:12.530 --> 47:14.964
- Yuri Orlov.
- Mr. Orlov.

47:15.033 --> 47:16.967
Always in the wrong place
at the right time.

47:19.771 --> 47:22.797
We've met before.
Off the coast of Columbia.

47:22.874 --> 47:25.172
What was the name of that freighter?
I can't remember.

47:25.243 --> 47:27.643
Was it Kono
or the Kristol?

47:27.712 --> 47:30.146
The crew called
that vessel a lot of names,

47:30.214 --> 47:32.648
none of them repeatable
in polite company.

47:32.717 --> 47:35.982
- Answer the question.
- The new MP-5.

47:36.054 --> 47:38.045
Would you like a silencer for that?

47:38.122 --> 47:39.612
I need to see your papers.

47:42.760 --> 47:44.819
Dmitri!

47:48.099 --> 47:50.431
The end-user certificate
for this aircraft

47:50.501 --> 47:53.163
states "Burkina Faso."

47:53.237 --> 47:56.035
Nice. Very nice.
Did you type this up yourself?

47:56.107 --> 47:58.735
The helicopter is to be used
on humanitarian missions.

47:58.810 --> 48:01.802
- Oh, so you're a humanitarian?
- Oh, absolutely.

48:01.879 --> 48:04.643
(laughs)
This is a military aircraft.

48:04.716 --> 48:06.980
- Not anymore.
- Listen to the nephew.

48:07.051 --> 48:11.181
What can they do with military hardware
but convert it to civilian use?

48:11.255 --> 48:14.315
The only way you could die from this
baby now is if a food drop hits you.

48:17.261 --> 48:20.458
And this stuff over here?
Is that going to Burkina Faso as well?

48:20.531 --> 48:23.056
Ah, but to a different client
at a different address.

48:23.134 --> 48:26.865
Just a coincidence, is that it? Do you
take me for a complete fucking fool?

48:26.938 --> 48:30.396
Not complete, sir.
And while I hesitate to tell you your job,

48:30.475 --> 48:33.137
I must point out
that when shipped separately

48:33.211 --> 48:35.202
the weapons and the aircraft
both comply

48:35.279 --> 48:37.611
with the current Interpol
trade standards and practices.

48:37.682 --> 48:41.140
We both know that is an obscene
bureaucratic loophole

48:41.219 --> 48:43.414
that's gonna be closed
any goddamn day.

48:43.488 --> 48:45.456
But it's not closed.

48:45.523 --> 48:48.788
And while certain people might
interpret this cargo as suspicious,

48:48.860 --> 48:52.261
thank God we live in a world where
suspicion alone does not constitute crime.

48:52.330 --> 48:55.265
And where men like you
respect the rule of law.

49:00.204 --> 49:03.537
<i>Yuri: I was as guilty as sin,
but Valentine couldn't prove it.</i>

49:03.608 --> 49:06.338
<i>And he was the rarest breed
of law enforcement officer.</i>

49:06.411 --> 49:08.242
<i>The type who knew
I was breaking the law</i>

49:08.312 --> 49:10.712
<i>but wouldn't break it himself
to bust me.</i>

49:14.619 --> 49:17.520
<i>Valentine wasn't the only one trying
to put me out of business.</i>

49:17.588 --> 49:20.489
<i>My uncle had turned down
a half dozen rival arms dealers.</i>

49:20.558 --> 49:22.753
<i>Sometimes with offers
better than mine.</i>

49:22.827 --> 49:26.126
<i>But to Dmitri, you couldn't
put a price on loyalty.</i>

49:39.444 --> 49:42.538
- What was he doing here?
- He is hoping to beat your offer.

49:42.613 --> 49:46.140
I told him to go have
intercourse with himself.

49:46.217 --> 49:48.811
- But Yuri...
- You need to make more payoffs.

49:48.886 --> 49:50.513
- Too many know.
- Don't worry.

49:50.588 --> 49:53.489
There are more VCRs, cigarettes.
I left them in your new car.

49:53.558 --> 49:57.255
Even your enemy
was admiring that car.

50:00.898 --> 50:03.731
(laughing)
I am the luckiest man alive.

50:03.801 --> 50:05.359
You are.

50:43.441 --> 50:45.341
- Hello?
- Ava?

50:45.409 --> 50:47.377
Hi, baby.

50:47.445 --> 50:49.640
You forget what time it is?

50:49.714 --> 50:52.239
I'm sorry, l...

50:52.316 --> 50:55.342
how was that...
your audition?

50:55.419 --> 50:57.944
They're going in another direction.

50:58.022 --> 51:00.149
Direction of someone who can act.

51:00.224 --> 51:01.816
They don't deserve you.

51:03.628 --> 51:06.791
Where are you?
Is everything okay?

51:08.733 --> 51:10.997
It was a rough day
at the office.

51:11.068 --> 51:13.434
<i>- Come home.
- Soon.</i>

51:13.504 --> 51:15.870
<i>- How's Nicki?
- He misses you.</i>

51:15.940 --> 51:17.874
<i>We both do.</i>

51:17.942 --> 51:20.672
It's lonely without you here.

51:20.745 --> 51:23.543
You know I don't like nights.

51:23.614 --> 51:25.514
Ever since my parents.

51:33.157 --> 51:35.125
<i>Yuri, what's that?</i>

51:35.193 --> 51:37.491
A party.
I better go.

51:37.562 --> 51:39.621
<i>Just wanted to call
and hear your voice.</i>

51:39.697 --> 51:41.528
<i>- Kiss Nicki for me.
- I love you.</i>

51:45.403 --> 51:47.633
<i>Yuri:
The pillaging didn't die with my uncle.</i>

51:48.706 --> 51:52.233
<i>After The Wall came down
$32 billion dollars</i>

51:52.310 --> 51:55.609
<i>worth of arms were stolen
and resold from Ukraine alone.</i>

51:55.680 --> 51:58.672
<i>One of the greatest heists
of the 20th century.</i>

52:12.496 --> 52:14.430
<i>The primary market was Africa.</i>

52:14.498 --> 52:17.797
<i>11 major conflicts
involving 32 countries</i>

52:17.868 --> 52:20.666
<i>in less than a decade.
A gunrunner's wet dream.</i>

52:20.738 --> 52:22.968
<i>At the time,
the West couldn't care less.</i>

52:23.040 --> 52:25.736
<i>They had a white war in what
was left of Yugoslavia.</i>

52:25.810 --> 52:28.779
<i>I did the bulk of my business
in Liberia.</i>

52:28.846 --> 52:30.609
<i>"Land of the Free."</i>

52:30.681 --> 52:34.310
<i>Originally established as a homeland
for freed American slaves,</i>

52:34.385 --> 52:37.286
<i>it's been enslaved by one dictator
or another ever since.</i>

52:37.355 --> 52:40.847
<i>The latest was American-educated
self-declared president</i>

52:40.925 --> 52:42.756
<i>Andre Baptiste.</i>

52:47.765 --> 52:51.132
- Mr. Yuri!

52:51.202 --> 52:53.363
I'm Andre Baptiste Jr.

52:54.905 --> 52:56.600
My father would like to meet you.

52:56.674 --> 52:59.165
What an honor.

52:59.243 --> 53:02.110
Thank him, but unfortunately
I have other business.

53:02.179 --> 53:04.943
It's a shame.
It's a very busy schedule.

53:05.016 --> 53:07.109
(laughing)

53:11.389 --> 53:13.482
It is not...

53:13.557 --> 53:16.993
as they say, optional.

53:18.496 --> 53:21.590
My father is easily offended.

53:21.666 --> 53:24.692
My schedule just freed up.

53:24.769 --> 53:26.202
Whoo!

53:26.404 --> 53:29.134
<i>Yuri: President Baptiste
was my best customer</i>

53:29.206 --> 53:31.174
<i>but I was in no hurry to meet him.</i>

53:31.242 --> 53:33.972
<i>He's gotten a reputation
for routinely hacking off the limbs</i>

53:34.045 --> 53:35.842
<i>of those who opposed him.</i>

53:35.913 --> 53:38.313
<i>His seven-year civil war
has been described as</i>

53:38.382 --> 53:41.909
<i>a relentless campaign
of sadistic wanton violence.</i>

53:41.986 --> 53:44.454
<i>That kind of sums up Andy for me.</i>

53:44.522 --> 53:47.286
(engine revs)

53:47.358 --> 53:49.588
The Glock is interesting.

53:49.660 --> 53:52.823
<i>It's made of a polymer composite.</i>

53:52.897 --> 53:55.331
Many of my clients feel they can
get through airport security

53:55.399 --> 53:57.424
without setting off a lot
of bells and whistles.

53:57.501 --> 53:59.093
Personally,
I do not recommend that.

53:59.170 --> 54:03.539
<i>On the other hand, if you are looking
for a traditional wheel gun,</i>

54:03.607 --> 54:06.542
there is no substitute for
the six inches of muzzle energy

54:06.610 --> 54:10.171
of the.357 Magnum.
And of course, it will never jam.

54:12.583 --> 54:14.346
Why'd you do that?!

54:14.418 --> 54:16.181
What did you say?

54:17.788 --> 54:20.780
Well now you're gonna have to buy it.
It's a used gun.

54:20.858 --> 54:23.156
(cocking guns)

54:23.227 --> 54:25.422
How can I sell a used gun?

54:26.464 --> 54:29.956
(chuckles)
A used gun.

54:30.034 --> 54:33.197
A used gun.

54:33.270 --> 54:36.137
That's a good one.
(laughs)

54:37.208 --> 54:41.110
You know, there is no discipline
with the youth today.

54:41.178 --> 54:43.738
I try to set an example
but it is difficult.

54:45.282 --> 54:47.716
Personally, I blame MTV.

54:52.156 --> 54:54.124
A used gun.

54:55.826 --> 54:57.817
(laughs)

54:57.895 --> 55:00.295
I think you and I,

55:00.364 --> 55:02.264
we can do business.

55:03.667 --> 55:06.431
<i>Yuri: If I thought
I was scared of Andre Sr.,</i>

55:06.504 --> 55:09.132
<i>I knew I was scared of Andre Jr.</i>

55:09.206 --> 55:11.106
<i>Like father like son.</i>

55:11.175 --> 55:14.508
<i>The guava doesn't fall
too far from the tree.</i>

55:14.578 --> 55:16.170
<i>He was also a cannibal.</i>

55:16.247 --> 55:19.410
<i>They say Andre would eat a victim's
heart while it was still beating</i>

55:19.483 --> 55:21.849
<i>to give him superhuman strength.</i>

55:21.919 --> 55:24.217
(gunfire)

55:28.959 --> 55:32.019
<i>Monrovia itself was like
being on another planet.</i>

55:32.096 --> 55:34.189
<i>Planet Monrovia.</i>

55:34.265 --> 55:37.792
<i>From the temperature, it was
obviously a planet close to the sun.</i>

55:39.069 --> 55:42.698
<i>I rarely saw another white man
and I never left town alone.</i>

55:42.773 --> 55:45.037
<i>Outside town was the edge of hell.</i>

55:45.109 --> 55:47.339
<i>I didn't want to even gaze into it.</i>

55:47.411 --> 55:49.709
Andre Jr:
This is your hotel.

55:49.780 --> 55:51.975
Two stars.

55:53.284 --> 55:55.149
Can you bring me the gun of Rambo?

55:55.219 --> 55:56.948
Part one, two or three?

55:57.021 --> 55:59.854
- I've only seen part one.
- The M-60.

55:59.924 --> 56:02.017
Would you like
the armor piercing bullets?

56:02.092 --> 56:04.185
Please.

56:04.261 --> 56:07.424
My father left a welcoming
present in your room.

56:07.498 --> 56:09.591
Enjoy.

56:09.667 --> 56:11.692
(laughs)

56:24.482 --> 56:28.441
My God,
she nearly got her head cut off.

56:29.753 --> 56:33.849
When I get to America,
I will not live in Brentwood.

56:33.924 --> 56:36.290
Second floor.

56:41.298 --> 56:43.766
<i>Yuri: In the most AIDS
infested region of the globe,</i>

56:43.834 --> 56:46.132
<i>where one in four is infected,</i>

56:46.203 --> 56:48.933
<i>Andre's idea of a joke
was to put a young Iman</i>

56:49.006 --> 56:50.871
<i>and a young Naomi in my bed</i>

56:50.941 --> 56:53.637
<i>and no condom within 100 miles.</i>

57:00.184 --> 57:01.913
(clears throat)

57:07.424 --> 57:09.858
Hello, Mr. Yuri.

57:09.927 --> 57:11.895
Hi.

57:11.962 --> 57:14.931
We'd be happy to make you happy.

57:14.999 --> 57:17.297
Uh...

57:17.368 --> 57:19.063
I can't.

57:19.136 --> 57:22.731
I'd love to,
but I can't.

57:22.806 --> 57:25.832
Don't worry.
We don't have anything.

57:29.113 --> 57:31.240
Oh.

57:31.315 --> 57:33.408
How do you know?

57:34.919 --> 57:37.410
Do we look like it?

57:37.488 --> 57:39.854
What if I have AIDS?
Don't you worry?

57:41.659 --> 57:43.718
You worry too much.

57:43.794 --> 57:47.525
Why do you worry about something
that can kill you in 10 years

57:47.598 --> 57:50.362
when there's so many things

57:50.434 --> 57:51.924
that can kill you today?

57:54.471 --> 57:56.439
Now...

57:57.675 --> 58:00.007
how can we make you happy?

58:02.413 --> 58:04.278
- By leaving.
- (music stops)

58:06.450 --> 58:08.975
(exhales)

58:09.052 --> 58:12.078
<i>Andre:
These are my Kalashnikov Kids,</i>

58:12.156 --> 58:15.125
my Boy Brigades.

58:15.192 --> 58:17.990
<i>I can see what you are thinking,</i>

58:18.061 --> 58:20.154
<i>but we need every man we can get.</i>

58:20.230 --> 58:22.255
Even if they're not men?

58:22.332 --> 58:25.460
A bullet from a 14-year-old
is just as effective

58:25.536 --> 58:27.936
as one from a 40-year-old.

58:28.005 --> 58:30.132
Often more effective.

58:33.110 --> 58:35.840
No one can stop this bath of blood.

58:35.913 --> 58:38.108
It's not bath of blood,
it's bloodbath.

58:38.182 --> 58:40.650
(chuckles)
Thank you,

58:41.685 --> 58:43.710
but I prefer it my way.

58:55.799 --> 58:58.734
I am not going to pay
your asking price.

58:58.802 --> 59:00.929
We are not a rich people.
And besides,

59:01.004 --> 59:04.201
the market is already flooded
with your Kalashnikovs.

59:04.274 --> 59:06.469
Do you realize in some parts
of my country

59:06.543 --> 59:08.511
you can get one
for the price of a chicken?

59:08.579 --> 59:11.878
But you can't just look at the unit price.
You forget ancillary costs.

59:11.949 --> 59:14.315
End-user certificates need
to be forged and notarized.

59:14.384 --> 59:17.512
Shell companies set up, insurance
purchased, pilots and crews hired.

59:17.588 --> 59:19.215
Not to mention the bribes.

59:19.289 --> 59:22.258
<i>You can't get a nut and bolt out
of the Eastern Bloc without a bribe.</i>

59:22.326 --> 59:25.386
There's one bribe for the nut,
another for the bolt.

59:25.462 --> 59:28.795
Andy, Andy, listen to me.
This is an expensive proposition

59:28.866 --> 59:30.527
Andy?

59:32.269 --> 59:35.602
I am going to pay you in timber.

59:37.508 --> 59:39.567
Or stones.

59:42.312 --> 59:44.075
Well, I'll take the stones.

59:44.147 --> 59:47.082
It's kind of hard to get a tree trunk
into my hand luggage.

59:47.150 --> 59:50.608
<i>I know you're planning
a new offensive.</i>

59:50.687 --> 59:54.282
If you can delay a week I can get you
armored personnel carriers.

59:54.358 --> 59:57.293
<i>They'd greatly reduce
your casualties</i>

59:57.361 --> 59:59.727
and give you a significant
strategic advantage.

01:00:01.598 --> 01:00:04.431
You know, they call me
the Lord of War,

01:00:04.501 --> 01:00:07.061
but perhaps it is you.

01:00:07.137 --> 01:00:10.868
It's not Lord of War.
It's Warlord.

01:00:12.242 --> 01:00:14.836
Thank you,
but I prefer it my way.

01:00:16.547 --> 01:00:18.640
(laughs)

01:00:18.715 --> 01:00:22.151
<i>Yuri: Conflict diamonds are
a common currency in West Africa.</i>

01:00:22.219 --> 01:00:24.278
<i>Also referred to
as blood diamonds,</i>

01:00:24.354 --> 01:00:28.085
<i>since bloodshed is what
they generally finance.</i>

01:00:28.325 --> 01:00:30.418
<i>By the late '90s, my wealth
had caught up</i>

01:00:30.494 --> 01:00:34.089
<i>to my lies about my wealth.
Even surpassed my lies.</i>

01:00:34.164 --> 01:00:37.065
<i>I could even afford to become
a patron of the arts.</i>

01:00:46.076 --> 01:00:48.010
I can't believe it.

01:00:48.078 --> 01:00:51.536
Well, of course
it's wonderful. I just...

01:00:51.615 --> 01:00:55.073
I didn't expect it
to happen so soon.

01:00:55.152 --> 01:00:56.676
Yes, well, that...

01:00:56.753 --> 01:01:01.247
well, that would
be great, too, yeah.

01:01:01.325 --> 01:01:03.452
It's wonderful.
Thank you so much.

01:01:03.527 --> 01:01:06.860
It's... Yuri.
Okay, thank you. Bye.

01:01:06.930 --> 01:01:09.660
Yuri, that was the dealer on the phone.
I just sold my first painting.

01:01:09.733 --> 01:01:11.997
That's fantastic!

01:01:12.069 --> 01:01:14.629
(laughing)
Who bought it?

01:01:14.705 --> 01:01:17.173
Someone important.
They wanna remain anonymous.

01:01:17.240 --> 01:01:20.004
- This is so wonderful.
- Yeah, how was your trip?

01:01:20.077 --> 01:01:22.511
You know, same old, same old.
Where's Nicki?

01:01:22.579 --> 01:01:24.740
In bed. I'm sorry.
He couldn't stay up.

01:01:24.815 --> 01:01:27.283
- Well, that's best.
- My first painting.

01:01:27.351 --> 01:01:28.943
I'm officially an artist.

01:01:29.019 --> 01:01:32.682
- This calls for a drink.
- What doesn't?

01:01:32.756 --> 01:01:34.883
Hi.

01:01:34.958 --> 01:01:37.722
- Yuri, this is, uh, uh...
- Candy.

01:01:37.794 --> 01:01:40.194
- Candy, of course.
- Hi.

01:01:40.263 --> 01:01:42.197
Any friend of my brother's

01:01:42.265 --> 01:01:45.598
is a friend of my brother's.

01:01:45.669 --> 01:01:48.763
You have a beautiful everything.

01:01:50.173 --> 01:01:51.697
Yes, he does.

01:01:51.775 --> 01:01:52.935
Yes, I do.

01:01:53.010 --> 01:01:55.638
- I'm gonna kiss Nicki good night.
- Okay.

01:02:50.067 --> 01:02:52.001
How are you, brother?

01:02:52.069 --> 01:02:53.934
Oh, you know,

01:02:54.004 --> 01:02:55.938
still the resident family fuck up.

01:02:56.006 --> 01:02:59.498
Yeah, well, I guess
someone has to do it.

01:02:59.576 --> 01:03:02.545
Yeah.

01:03:02.612 --> 01:03:06.104
Hey, Ava knows, right?

01:03:10.487 --> 01:03:13.285
I never want to say anything.

01:03:13.356 --> 01:03:15.824
She doesn't have to know.
She understands.

01:03:15.892 --> 01:03:18.156
She's a survivor, like me.

01:03:18.228 --> 01:03:20.423
Well, she may be a survivor,

01:03:20.497 --> 01:03:23.762
but she's not like you.

01:03:25.502 --> 01:03:27.766
Really, she doesn't know how
you pay for all this?

01:03:27.838 --> 01:03:29.829
We don't talk about it.

01:03:29.906 --> 01:03:33.467
How many car salesmen
talk about their work, huh?

01:03:33.543 --> 01:03:35.477
How many cigarette salesmen?
Both their products

01:03:35.545 --> 01:03:37.479
kill more people every year
than mine.

01:03:37.547 --> 01:03:40.948
At least mine
has a safety switch.

01:03:41.017 --> 01:03:45.147
If those guys can leave
their work at the office, so can I.

01:03:45.222 --> 01:03:49.522
Goddamn, you are good.

01:03:51.428 --> 01:03:53.225
You really are.

01:03:53.296 --> 01:03:56.629
You almost had me convinced.

01:04:06.910 --> 01:04:10.937
Could you, uh...

01:04:11.014 --> 01:04:13.983
could you help me out
with some...

01:04:19.623 --> 01:04:21.853
Why?

01:04:21.925 --> 01:04:23.859
Why?

01:04:23.927 --> 01:04:27.363
Why?

01:04:27.430 --> 01:04:29.489
Why what?

01:04:29.566 --> 01:04:33.024
- Why, why, why, why?
- I don't know. I don't know.

01:04:33.103 --> 01:04:35.128
Why what?

01:04:35.205 --> 01:04:38.106
Why are you so fucked up
all the time?

01:04:43.847 --> 01:04:46.077
Because I am.

01:04:56.126 --> 01:04:57.923
<i>Yuri: I didn't know how much
Ava really knew</i>

01:04:57.994 --> 01:05:00.326
<i>and how much she ignored.</i>

01:05:00.397 --> 01:05:03.230
<i>She never questioned how a guy
in the transport business</i>

01:05:03.300 --> 01:05:05.962
<i>could afford to give her
18-karat diamond earrings.</i>

01:05:06.036 --> 01:05:09.403
<i>I guess she didn't really want
to hear the answer.</i>

01:05:09.472 --> 01:05:12.771
<i>Mostly, she seemed content
that I was a good provider,</i>

01:05:12.843 --> 01:05:15.710
<i>and as far as she
was concerned, loyal.</i>

01:05:15.779 --> 01:05:18.771
<i>Despite the other women,
I always made love to Ava</i>

01:05:18.849 --> 01:05:20.908
<i>as if she was the only one.</i>

01:05:24.521 --> 01:05:26.648
<i>I'm not saying
I didn't have setbacks.</i>

01:05:26.723 --> 01:05:28.657
<i>It's not called
"gunrunning" for nothing.</i>

01:05:28.725 --> 01:05:30.659
<i>You gotta be fast
on your feet.</i>

01:05:30.727 --> 01:05:33.662
<i>Some revolutions blow over
before the guns even get there.</i>

01:05:33.730 --> 01:05:36.631
<i>There's nothing more expensive
for an arms dealer than peace.</i>

01:05:36.700 --> 01:05:39.191
Truce?
What do you mean truce?

01:05:39.269 --> 01:05:42.102
The guns are already
on their way.

01:05:42.172 --> 01:05:45.039
Peace talks.

01:05:45.108 --> 01:05:47.542
All right, forget it.
I'll reroute the shipment to the Balkans.

01:05:47.611 --> 01:05:50.239
When they say they're gonna
have a war, they keep their word.

01:05:58.255 --> 01:06:00.189
<i>Yuri: Of course,
a new breed of gun-runner</i>

01:06:00.257 --> 01:06:02.418
<i>requires a new breed
of cop.</i>

01:06:07.297 --> 01:06:09.265
Henry, take Park Avenue.

01:06:23.680 --> 01:06:26.171
(horns honk)

01:06:26.249 --> 01:06:28.774
Take 'em on a tour
of New Jersey.

01:07:03.086 --> 01:07:05.611
<i>Ava: Yuri...</i>

01:07:05.689 --> 01:07:08.214
there are men
going through our garbage cans.

01:07:08.291 --> 01:07:12.159
It's probably just some reporters
looking for somebody else.

01:07:12.228 --> 01:07:15.220
I have a feeling
they don't work for the tabloids.

01:07:16.566 --> 01:07:19.000
<i>Yuri...</i>

01:07:19.069 --> 01:07:22.436
is there anything
I should be worried about?

01:07:22.505 --> 01:07:25.030
No, nothing.

01:07:25.108 --> 01:07:27.838
<i>- Nothing.
- I love you.</i>

01:07:27.911 --> 01:07:30.539
I love you too.

01:07:34.284 --> 01:07:36.252
Sir.

01:08:24.600 --> 01:08:26.432
<i>Yuri: I was now the best
merchant of death alive.</i>

01:08:26.502 --> 01:08:29.096
<i>I didn't own my own plane.
I owned a fleet.</i>

01:08:29.171 --> 01:08:32.733
<i>Running guns into Liberia,
Sierra Leone or the Ivory Coast</i>

01:08:32.809 --> 01:08:36.404
<i>at least once a week.
Most trips, I had phony paperwork.</i>

01:08:36.479 --> 01:08:39.038
<i>If the deadline was tight
and I had to cut corners,</i>

01:08:39.115 --> 01:08:41.379
<i>I had no paperwork at all.</i>

01:08:43.286 --> 01:08:45.345
<i>But I wasn't overly concerned.</i>

01:08:45.421 --> 01:08:47.652
<i>There was hardly any radar
over most of Africa,</i>

01:08:47.724 --> 01:08:49.692
<i>and even fewer people
to watch it.</i>

01:08:54.798 --> 01:08:56.890
<i>Valentine: Charlie, Echo, India.</i>

01:08:56.966 --> 01:08:58.796
Reroute to Kabala airport

01:08:58.868 --> 01:09:02.359
on heading 0-2-9.
Comply immediately.

01:09:13.817 --> 01:09:15.716
(cell phone rings)

01:09:15.785 --> 01:09:18.618
Colonel Southern, it's Yuri.
I'm sorry to call you on this number,

01:09:18.688 --> 01:09:20.656
but I've got Interpol
all over my ass.

01:09:20.723 --> 01:09:24.124
I can't know you right now.
It's not a good time.

01:09:25.694 --> 01:09:27.526
Not a good time?

01:09:37.107 --> 01:09:39.837
Charlie, Echo, India,
comply immediately.

01:09:39.908 --> 01:09:41.308
<i>This is your last warning.</i>

01:09:41.377 --> 01:09:42.639
Where was the first
fucking warning?

01:09:42.712 --> 01:09:44.475
<i>Rock your wings
if you intend to comply.</i>

01:09:44.546 --> 01:09:46.742
I'm putting us down.

01:09:51.087 --> 01:09:53.850
If you land, we're all going away.
I don't have paperwork.

01:09:53.923 --> 01:09:56.323
- We're in a flying fucking bomb.
- They're firing bullets at our bullets.

01:09:56.392 --> 01:09:58.223
<i>I'm putting us down.</i>

01:09:58.294 --> 01:10:00.728
Okay, okay, fuck!

01:10:00.797 --> 01:10:03.027
This is Charlie, Echo, India.

01:10:03.099 --> 01:10:06.728
<i>Request to reroute
to Kabala airport on bearing 0-2-9.</i>

01:10:06.803 --> 01:10:10.762
No, not the airport. There, the highway.
It's our only hope.

01:10:10.840 --> 01:10:13.673
Are you fucking mad?
A pothole will set us off.

01:10:13.743 --> 01:10:15.711
You underestimate yourself,
Alexei.

01:10:15.778 --> 01:10:19.009
You're the best.
You're the shit, Alexei. You're the shit!

01:10:19.082 --> 01:10:21.710
You're the shit!
You're the shit!

01:10:21.784 --> 01:10:24.116
<i>Yuri: Of course,
Alexei wasn't the best.</i>

01:10:24.187 --> 01:10:27.623
<i>He'd come 42nd out of 43
at the Moscow Flight School.</i>

01:10:35.198 --> 01:10:37.689
Oh, God, what's he doing?

01:10:37.767 --> 01:10:39.735
Is this guy nuts?

01:10:41.804 --> 01:10:43.135
I can't land there, sir.

01:10:43.206 --> 01:10:46.175
Kabala's only 15 minutes away.
He can't get far.

01:10:46.242 --> 01:10:48.870
I want a truck on the tarmac.

01:11:10.633 --> 01:11:12.601
(speaks Russian)

01:11:43.499 --> 01:11:44.625
(speaks Russian)

01:11:59.082 --> 01:12:00.481
(sighs)

01:12:03.920 --> 01:12:07.378
We're gonna be okay.

01:12:07.457 --> 01:12:09.652
<i>Yuri: Where you going?</i>

01:12:09.726 --> 01:12:12.160
As far from the evidence
as we can get.

01:12:12.228 --> 01:12:14.025
Wait, there's not gonna be
any evidence.

01:12:29.412 --> 01:12:32.472
Come here, come here.

01:12:34.150 --> 01:12:37.483
Hey, don't be shy.
Here, look. Free sample.

01:12:37.553 --> 01:12:40.215
Help yourself, okay?
Free sample. Tell your friends.

01:12:40.290 --> 01:12:42.383
Come here.
You want something? Look.

01:12:42.458 --> 01:12:44.323
Want an RPG?
All for you. All right?

01:12:44.394 --> 01:12:47.090
Happy times. Come on.
Help yourselves.

01:12:47.163 --> 01:12:48.858
No charge.
Everything goes.

01:12:48.931 --> 01:12:51.764
Guns, guns, guns.
Yeah, come on up!

01:12:51.834 --> 01:12:53.768
Yeah, having fun now, huh?

01:12:55.605 --> 01:12:59.439
<i>Come on.
Guns, guns, guns! Yeah!</i>

01:12:59.509 --> 01:13:01.534
Bullets, guns, grenades.

01:13:01.611 --> 01:13:05.240
Hooray, yeah, take 'em all.
Take the whole crate.

01:13:05.315 --> 01:13:09.513
Go ahead, take the crate.
Everybody, come on.

01:13:09.585 --> 01:13:12.452
Guns, grenades, hooray!

01:13:12.522 --> 01:13:14.956
<i>Bullets, guns, grenades!</i>

01:13:15.024 --> 01:13:17.549
<i>Yeah!</i>

01:13:17.627 --> 01:13:19.094
That one's got
your name on it.

01:13:19.162 --> 01:13:21.926
You want one, too? Come on.
We got bullets.

01:13:21.998 --> 01:13:23.693
<i>Don't forget the bullets.</i>

01:13:23.766 --> 01:13:26.428
How can you shoot a gun
if you don't have bullets?

01:13:26.502 --> 01:13:28.697
Everything goes for free.

01:13:28.771 --> 01:13:31.262
<i>Guns, grenades, RPGs,</i>

01:13:31.341 --> 01:13:34.276
<i>bullets, guns, yeah!</i>

01:13:34.344 --> 01:13:37.040
<i>Hooray, hooray!
Want some bullets?</i>

01:13:37.113 --> 01:13:39.445
<i>Gotta have bullets.</i>

01:13:39.515 --> 01:13:42.416
<i>What a cargo crew at
Heathrow Airport does in a day</i>

01:13:42.485 --> 01:13:46.683
<i>took a bunch of malnourished
Sierra Leonean locals 10 minutes.</i>

01:13:48.191 --> 01:13:50.216
<i>By the time Agent Valentine
got there,</i>

01:13:50.293 --> 01:13:52.955
<i>you could find more guns
on a plane full of Quakers.</i>

01:14:00.136 --> 01:14:02.661
Yuri Orlov.

01:14:02.739 --> 01:14:05.606
- Ow, fuck!
- You run from us?

01:14:05.675 --> 01:14:07.165
No, Mbizi, no.

01:14:07.243 --> 01:14:09.905
Can he run with no legs?

01:14:09.979 --> 01:14:13.244
Let me make him disappear, Mr. Valentine.
Around here, people disappear all the time.

01:14:13.316 --> 01:14:15.682
- I can't do that.
- Look where we are.

01:14:15.752 --> 01:14:19.688
Who will know?

01:14:19.756 --> 01:14:22.122
We will.

01:14:27.397 --> 01:14:29.422
He's gonna get
what's coming to him.

01:14:29.499 --> 01:14:31.433
I'm not as certain.

01:14:33.202 --> 01:14:36.035
(coughs)

01:14:40.176 --> 01:14:42.235
All right, get up.

01:14:45.681 --> 01:14:49.014
- What's the charge?
- What are you doing in Sierra Leone?

01:14:49.085 --> 01:14:53.818
- I'm on safari.
- Yeah, you're hunting wildebeests

01:14:53.890 --> 01:14:56.859
- with a submachine gun?
- Do you also work with the Park Service?

01:14:56.926 --> 01:14:58.951
Hunting without a license.
Is that the charge?

01:14:59.028 --> 01:15:02.691
Why are we playing games?
You traffic arms.

01:15:02.765 --> 01:15:05.256
- Trade.
- Trade, traffic.

01:15:05.334 --> 01:15:09.270
You get rich by giving
the poorest people on the planet

01:15:09.338 --> 01:15:11.272
the means to continue
killing each other.

01:15:11.340 --> 01:15:13.001
Do you know why I do
what I do?

01:15:13.075 --> 01:15:16.067
I mean, there are more
prestigious assignments.

01:15:16.145 --> 01:15:17.772
Keeping track
of nuclear arsenals.

01:15:17.847 --> 01:15:21.078
You'd think that more critical
to world security, but it's not.

01:15:21.150 --> 01:15:23.516
No, nine out of 10
war victims today

01:15:23.586 --> 01:15:26.919
are killed with assault rifles
and small arms like yours.

01:15:26.989 --> 01:15:29.048
Those nuclear missiles,
they sit in their silos.

01:15:29.125 --> 01:15:33.357
Your AK-47, that is the real weapon
of mass destruction.

01:15:33.429 --> 01:15:36.364
I don't want people dead,
Agent Valentine.

01:15:36.432 --> 01:15:39.526
I don't put a gun to anybody's
head and make them shoot.

01:15:39.602 --> 01:15:42.503
I admit, a shooting war's
better for business,

01:15:42.572 --> 01:15:44.563
but I prefer people to fire
my guns and miss,

01:15:44.640 --> 01:15:46.574
just as long as they're firing.

01:15:56.586 --> 01:15:59.384
Can I go now?
You've got nothing on me.

01:15:59.455 --> 01:16:01.946
Except cuffs.

01:16:04.460 --> 01:16:06.985
<i>Since you're so concerned
with the law,</i>

01:16:07.063 --> 01:16:11.124
you must know I'm legally permitted
to hold you for 24 hours

01:16:11.200 --> 01:16:14.363
without charging you.
You might ask why I would do that.

01:16:14.437 --> 01:16:17.167
And I can assure you it's not because
I enjoy your company,

01:16:17.240 --> 01:16:18.867
because I don't.
No.

01:16:18.941 --> 01:16:21.910
The reason why I will delay you
for every second

01:16:21.978 --> 01:16:25.004
of the permissible 24 hours
is I am delaying

01:16:25.081 --> 01:16:28.107
your deadly trade
and the deaths of your victims.

01:16:28.184 --> 01:16:32.052
I don't think of it as taking a day
from you, but giving a day to them.

01:16:32.121 --> 01:16:34.248
Some innocent man, woman or child

01:16:34.323 --> 01:16:36.587
is going to have
an extra day on this earth

01:16:36.659 --> 01:16:38.559
because you're not free.

01:16:40.096 --> 01:16:42.326
So, I will see you...

01:16:42.398 --> 01:16:44.730
in 23 hours

01:16:44.800 --> 01:16:47.166
and 55 minutes, huh?

01:16:52.575 --> 01:16:55.373
<i>Yuri: Valentine knew
he didn't have to guard me.</i>

01:16:55.444 --> 01:16:57.537
<i>There was nowhere to go.</i>

01:16:57.613 --> 01:17:00.446
<i>Or maybe he was hoping
the locals would tear me apart.</i>

01:17:00.516 --> 01:17:03.576
<i>But they were too busy with the plane.</i>

01:17:05.755 --> 01:17:09.282
<i>It's like parking your car in certain
neighborhoods in the Bronx.</i>

01:17:09.358 --> 01:17:11.349
<i>You just don't do it.</i>

01:17:23.105 --> 01:17:26.040
<i>The way I look at it,
it's the way of Africa,</i>

01:17:26.108 --> 01:17:28.042
<i>maybe life.</i>

01:17:28.110 --> 01:17:31.671
<i>Everything that comes from the earth
eventually returns.</i>

01:17:31.747 --> 01:17:35.239
<i>Even a 40-ton
Atonov-12 cargo plane.</i>

01:18:32.141 --> 01:18:35.804
A gift for you.

01:18:37.246 --> 01:18:39.942
You know,
you've arrived just in time.

01:18:40.016 --> 01:18:42.041
I was afraid that he might die

01:18:42.118 --> 01:18:44.746
before you got your chance

01:18:44.820 --> 01:18:47.220
to kill him.

01:18:52.194 --> 01:18:55.095
This man came here

01:18:55.164 --> 01:18:58.190
hoping to take your place.

01:19:01.170 --> 01:19:03.138
Is that not so?

01:19:14.183 --> 01:19:17.050
No, I'm not here
to supply Mr. Baptiste.

01:19:18.120 --> 01:19:21.556
I am here to supply his enemies.

01:19:24.627 --> 01:19:27.687
I fear it's a sale
I shall never complete.

01:19:31.133 --> 01:19:32.760
He killed your blood.

01:19:32.835 --> 01:19:35.099
Your uncle,

01:19:35.171 --> 01:19:38.004
when he tried to kill you.

01:19:46.315 --> 01:19:49.148
- (whispers) No.
- No?

01:19:52.088 --> 01:19:54.648
You want that I should let him go?

01:19:56.792 --> 01:20:00.353
- No, l...
- "No no, l..."

01:20:02.898 --> 01:20:04.957
You do want him dead.

01:20:05.034 --> 01:20:07.400
You just...

01:20:07.470 --> 01:20:10.064
don't want to have to do it yourself.

01:20:15.444 --> 01:20:17.742
So...

01:20:17.813 --> 01:20:20.008
we will do this together.

01:20:24.520 --> 01:20:27.853
This will be

01:20:27.923 --> 01:20:30.858
a bonding experience.

01:20:36.532 --> 01:20:39.865
You know that you can stop this
anytime that you want.

01:20:39.935 --> 01:20:41.630
But I don't think that you do.

01:20:41.704 --> 01:20:43.604
<i>Just say the word.</i>

01:20:45.374 --> 01:20:48.172
Say "stop."

01:21:01.624 --> 01:21:03.592
(whispers)
Stop.

01:21:03.659 --> 01:21:07.060
(laughs)

01:21:12.968 --> 01:21:15.198
I will get you another room,
my friend.

01:21:16.238 --> 01:21:18.604
With a much nicer view.

01:21:51.207 --> 01:21:53.607
He ordered you brown-brown,
Mr. Yuri.

01:21:57.847 --> 01:21:59.940
- What?
- Brown-brown.

01:22:00.015 --> 01:22:03.712
- What is it?
- It's a mixture of cocaine

01:22:03.786 --> 01:22:06.653
and gunpowder.

01:22:06.722 --> 01:22:09.384
They give it to the young boys
before they do battle.

01:22:09.458 --> 01:22:11.858
- They do anything.
- (groans)

01:22:12.895 --> 01:22:14.920
Some other time.

01:22:14.997 --> 01:22:18.398
I suggest you try it
at least once, Mr. Yuri.

01:22:18.467 --> 01:22:19.934
Why?

01:22:20.002 --> 01:22:23.438
Because it's your gunpowder.

01:22:23.505 --> 01:22:25.871
(laughs)

01:22:39.088 --> 01:22:40.749
All right.

01:22:45.227 --> 01:22:47.218
<i>Yuri:
Even before that night</i>

01:22:47.296 --> 01:22:50.060
<i>I started doing a lot of cocaine
in West Africa.</i>

01:22:50.132 --> 01:22:52.600
<i>I'd never tried
brown-brown before.</i>

01:22:52.668 --> 01:22:55.262
<i>But then I never killed a man either.</i>

01:22:55.337 --> 01:22:57.305
(children shouting)

01:22:58.641 --> 01:23:00.575
Here we go.
Come on!

01:23:02.578 --> 01:23:04.876
(children cheer)

01:23:05.981 --> 01:23:07.949
(laughing)

01:23:13.188 --> 01:23:15.520
(groaning)

01:23:19.695 --> 01:23:22.391
Oh, I didn't do anything,
did I?

01:23:23.432 --> 01:23:25.696
(speaking French)

01:23:30.205 --> 01:23:33.140
Wait, are you sick?
SIDA?

01:23:33.208 --> 01:23:34.607
AIDS?

01:23:36.245 --> 01:23:39.703
Ask the white man.
He will know.

01:23:39.782 --> 01:23:41.750
Sir, will my hand grow back?

01:23:50.759 --> 01:23:53.319
- Simeon?
- Remember, Yuri.

01:23:53.395 --> 01:23:55.590
Take sides.

01:23:58.600 --> 01:24:00.591
Simeon!

01:24:02.504 --> 01:24:05.064
- (groans)
- Don't! He's Andre's.

01:24:05.140 --> 01:24:08.234
- Fuck Andre.
- Yeah, fuck Andre.

01:24:09.411 --> 01:24:10.969
(gun clicks)

01:24:11.046 --> 01:24:12.877
I'm sorry.
They don't usually do that.

01:24:12.948 --> 01:24:15.542
(gun clicks)

01:24:15.617 --> 01:24:17.949
Well, let me look at it.
Maybe I can fix it

01:24:18.020 --> 01:24:20.614
Let me see it.
It's the magazine. Give it to me.

01:24:20.689 --> 01:24:23.715
- (groans)
- Fuck you!

01:24:36.872 --> 01:24:39.033
(growling)

01:24:49.885 --> 01:24:52.615
<i>Yuri:
I started to feel I'd been cursed.</i>

01:24:52.688 --> 01:24:54.918
<i>The curse of invincibility.</i>

01:24:55.224 --> 01:24:57.624
(imitating gunshots)

01:24:59.294 --> 01:25:01.125
Nicki, please go to your room.

01:25:04.733 --> 01:25:07.497
I don't believe you.

01:25:07.569 --> 01:25:09.867
Can you prove any of this?

01:25:09.938 --> 01:25:13.305
Mr. Orlov goes to a lot of trouble

01:25:13.375 --> 01:25:15.104
to make his business
look legitimate.

01:25:15.177 --> 01:25:19.113
<i>Even to you.
Perhaps especially to you.</i>

01:25:19.181 --> 01:25:22.150
I don't expect we're gonna find
anything here today.

01:25:22.217 --> 01:25:23.514
So what do you want?

01:25:26.021 --> 01:25:28.285
I was hoping that you would help me.

01:25:35.064 --> 01:25:38.124
I understand that, uh...

01:25:38.200 --> 01:25:41.033
your parents died tragically.

01:25:45.441 --> 01:25:48.274
<i>The illegal firearms used
to murder your mother and father</i>

01:25:48.343 --> 01:25:51.779
were procured from men
exactly like your husband.

01:25:54.216 --> 01:25:56.047
I'd like you to leave.

01:25:59.221 --> 01:26:02.156
Okay.
Gentlemen.

01:26:16.905 --> 01:26:19.669
Ava?

01:26:27.749 --> 01:26:29.341
Ava. What's wrong?

01:26:29.418 --> 01:26:32.854
I can't wear the clothes.

01:26:32.921 --> 01:26:35.412
I can't wear the jewelry.

01:26:36.725 --> 01:26:39.125
I can't drive the car.

01:26:41.130 --> 01:26:42.995
Can't live in this house.

01:26:43.065 --> 01:26:45.397
Everything's got blood on it.

01:26:45.467 --> 01:26:47.435
<i>Blood on it?</i>

01:26:48.470 --> 01:26:51.405
What's the matter with you?

01:26:54.776 --> 01:26:57.973
- Don't be so melodramatic.
- Of course I'm melodramatic.

01:26:58.046 --> 01:27:01.015
I'm a failed actress, remember?

01:27:08.423 --> 01:27:11.756
I told you,
these people, it's political.

01:27:11.827 --> 01:27:13.988
They lie.
They're liars.

01:27:14.062 --> 01:27:17.259
Look at me. Look. They lie to make
themselves look good, okay?

01:27:17.332 --> 01:27:19.061
You can't...
you can't trust them.

01:27:19.134 --> 01:27:21.034
It's not just them.

01:27:23.605 --> 01:27:26.005
Don't worry.
Your family didn't say anything.

01:27:26.074 --> 01:27:28.542
They didn't have to.

01:27:30.779 --> 01:27:32.974
I sell people a means

01:27:33.048 --> 01:27:36.142
to defend themselves, Ava.
That's all.

01:27:36.218 --> 01:27:38.186
Yuri, I see the news.

01:27:38.253 --> 01:27:40.483
I see those pictures.

01:27:40.556 --> 01:27:42.217
The guns are bigger than the boys.

01:27:42.291 --> 01:27:44.919
There is nothing illegal about what I do.

01:27:44.993 --> 01:27:47.223
I don't care if it's legal.

01:27:47.296 --> 01:27:49.764
It's wrong.

01:28:07.749 --> 01:28:10.445
Please stop.

01:28:13.055 --> 01:28:15.285
It makes no difference if I stop.

01:28:15.357 --> 01:28:18.349
Someone will take my place
the next day.

01:28:18.427 --> 01:28:21.487
So let them.
We have enough.

01:28:22.798 --> 01:28:25.824
It's not about the money.

01:28:25.901 --> 01:28:27.766
Then what is it?

01:28:32.541 --> 01:28:34.509
I'm good at it.

01:28:44.386 --> 01:28:47.947
I feel like all I've done
my whole life is be pretty.

01:28:48.023 --> 01:28:50.514
I mean,

01:28:50.592 --> 01:28:53.288
all I've done is be born.

01:28:54.429 --> 01:28:57.990
I'm a failed actress,
a failed artist.

01:28:58.066 --> 01:29:00.660
I'm not much good as a mother.

01:29:03.538 --> 01:29:06.234
Come to think of it,
I'm not even that pretty anymore.

01:29:09.578 --> 01:29:13.446
I have failed at everything, Yuri.

01:29:14.883 --> 01:29:17.943
But I won't fail as a human being.

01:29:23.025 --> 01:29:26.483
<i>Yuri: My enemies had finally found
a weapon that could hurt me.</i>

01:29:27.896 --> 01:29:30.262
<i>For the next six months
I stopped running guns.</i>

01:29:30.332 --> 01:29:32.664
<i>- I went legitimate.
- This is an untapped market.</i>

01:29:32.734 --> 01:29:36.795
I'm talking over five million cubic meters
of timber in the first year alone.

01:29:36.872 --> 01:29:39.067
Over 100 exploitable species.

01:29:39.141 --> 01:29:42.110
<i>The oil? Between you and me,
this is the new Texas.</i>

01:29:42.177 --> 01:29:44.372
<i>What do you say to over
10,000 barrels a month?</i>

01:29:44.446 --> 01:29:47.040
He must be lying.

01:29:47.115 --> 01:29:49.083
He's talking.

01:29:49.151 --> 01:29:52.450
<i>There's gas reserves off the Ivory Coast
that OPEC doesn't know about.</i>

01:29:52.521 --> 01:29:54.512
The phone numbers all check out.

01:29:56.158 --> 01:29:58.251
It's all on the level.

01:29:58.327 --> 01:30:01.262
<i>Yuri:
No wonder Valentine was confused.</i>

01:30:15.010 --> 01:30:17.308
<i>Thank God
there are still legal ways</i>

01:30:17.379 --> 01:30:19.711
<i>to exploit developing countries.</i>

01:30:19.781 --> 01:30:21.908
<i>But the only problem
with an honest buck</i>

01:30:21.983 --> 01:30:23.416
<i>is they're so hard to make.</i>

01:30:23.485 --> 01:30:25.316
<i>The margins are too low.</i>

01:30:25.387 --> 01:30:27.446
<i>Too many people are doing it.</i>

01:30:30.992 --> 01:30:34.484
<i>Still, I'd promised Ava.</i>

01:30:43.171 --> 01:30:46.140
Yuri, the president of Liberia
is on his way up.

01:30:47.409 --> 01:30:49.639
He's early.

01:30:50.779 --> 01:30:53.407
- I'll be back in a minute.
- Okay.

01:30:59.254 --> 01:31:01.449
What the fuck
are you doing here, Andre?

01:31:01.523 --> 01:31:03.821
We are here for peace talks
at the United Nations.

01:31:03.892 --> 01:31:05.860
So at the same time you thought
you'd drop in on your arms dealer?

01:31:05.927 --> 01:31:09.385
Well I was beginning to wonder
whether that was still your profession.

01:31:09.464 --> 01:31:12.297
You know you're a hard man
to get a hold of all of a sudden.

01:31:12.367 --> 01:31:14.892
That is a shame.

01:31:14.970 --> 01:31:18.235
My son and I, we were hoping
to do a little shopping

01:31:18.306 --> 01:31:21.434
- while we are here in New York.
- You know they're watching you.

01:31:21.510 --> 01:31:25.310
Yes, I know they blame me. They blame
me for everything, those hypocrites.

01:31:25.380 --> 01:31:28.543
- They're on a hunt for a witch.
- Witch-hunt.

01:31:28.617 --> 01:31:31.085
Hostilities have escalated.

01:31:31.153 --> 01:31:34.816
They are making it very difficult
for me to resupply.

01:31:34.890 --> 01:31:36.983
That requires a man

01:31:37.058 --> 01:31:39.993
of your rare ingenuity.

01:31:42.030 --> 01:31:43.998
I can't help you.
I'm sorry.

01:31:50.739 --> 01:31:52.832
I understand.

01:31:54.209 --> 01:31:56.177
But you should know this.

01:31:56.244 --> 01:31:59.611
Due to our present situation
we are compelled

01:31:59.681 --> 01:32:02.047
to be unusually generous.

01:32:07.322 --> 01:32:09.483
So see you soon,

01:32:09.558 --> 01:32:11.321
Lord of War.

01:32:14.996 --> 01:32:17.897
You still haven't brought me
the gun of Rambo.

01:32:21.903 --> 01:32:24.133
(laughs)

01:32:34.149 --> 01:32:36.447
<i>Yuri:
At four and a half months old</i>

01:32:36.518 --> 01:32:39.646
<i>a human fetus has a reptile's tail...</i>

01:32:39.721 --> 01:32:41.689
<i>a remnant of our evolution.</i>

01:32:41.756 --> 01:32:43.815
<i>Maybe that's what I couldn't escape.</i>

01:32:43.892 --> 01:32:46.190
<i>You can fight
a lot of enemies and survive.</i>

01:32:46.261 --> 01:32:49.162
<i>But if you fight your biology
you will always lose.</i>

01:32:49.231 --> 01:32:52.689
You guys aren't waiting to say goodbye?
I'm not leaving for another 10 minutes.

01:32:52.767 --> 01:32:55.099
- Sorry, Nicki has swim practice.
- Oh, okay.

01:32:55.170 --> 01:32:57.365
You know, I'm kind of glad
you're going.

01:32:57.439 --> 01:33:00.237
You've been here so long
you're starting to get on my nerves.

01:33:00.308 --> 01:33:02.833
This oil concession should be
wrapped up by Thursday.

01:33:02.911 --> 01:33:04.902
I'll be back for the weekend.
We'll go somewhere.

01:33:04.980 --> 01:33:07.949
- The sea.
- That would be fun.

01:33:08.016 --> 01:33:10.678
- Come on.
- Hey.

01:33:10.752 --> 01:33:13.414
You trust me, right?

01:33:14.456 --> 01:33:17.584
<i>Yuri: She looked me directly
in the eye the way I've looked in the eyes</i>

01:33:17.659 --> 01:33:20.253
<i>of a thousand customs officials,
government bureaucrats</i>

01:33:20.328 --> 01:33:21.795
<i>and law enforcement agents.</i>

01:33:21.863 --> 01:33:24.024
Yes, I trust you.

01:33:24.099 --> 01:33:26.795
<i>And she lied without flinching.</i>

01:33:26.868 --> 01:33:30.099
- I'll see you, big guy.
- Bye, Papa.

01:33:30.171 --> 01:33:32.071
<i>Yuri:
She learned from the best.</i>

01:33:32.140 --> 01:33:34.370
Have a good trip.

01:33:48.423 --> 01:33:51.324
- That's him.

01:34:12.514 --> 01:34:15.176
<i>- Where are we going, Mama?
- It's a game, honey.</i>

01:34:15.250 --> 01:34:17.844
Like hide and seek?

01:34:17.919 --> 01:34:20.046
Yes.

01:34:20.121 --> 01:34:22.681
Like hide and seek.

01:34:43.044 --> 01:34:45.342
<i>Yuri: I can always sense
when I'm being tailed.</i>

01:34:45.413 --> 01:34:47.142
<i>I know what to look for.</i>

01:34:47.215 --> 01:34:50.343
<i>But then I've never been tailed
by the woman I love.</i>

01:35:02.297 --> 01:35:04.765
<i>Yuri:
I can put myself in Ava's place.</i>

01:35:04.833 --> 01:35:07.199
<i>She might have understood
if the combination</i>

01:35:07.268 --> 01:35:09.532
<i>was the last four digits
of my social security number,</i>

01:35:09.604 --> 01:35:12.539
<i>my birthday, even her birthday.
But not Nicolai's.</i>

01:35:28.757 --> 01:35:31.817
<i>My son's birthday unlocked what
the government would later describe</i>

01:35:31.893 --> 01:35:33.758
as a catalogue of carnage.

01:35:33.828 --> 01:35:36.228
Honey, come over here.

01:35:44.372 --> 01:35:46.465
Nicki, stay right here.

01:36:48.670 --> 01:36:50.900
Come on, Nicki.

01:37:02.917 --> 01:37:05.147
Come to see
how the other half lives?

01:37:05.220 --> 01:37:07.211
I miss your borscht.

01:37:07.288 --> 01:37:09.620
- Mom and Dad say you're clean.
- Yeah, you too.

01:37:10.992 --> 01:37:14.860
You went legit, huh?
That's hard to believe.

01:37:14.929 --> 01:37:17.227
That's because it's not true.

01:37:19.000 --> 01:37:21.798
Only you know.
I'm leaving tonight on a job.

01:37:21.870 --> 01:37:24.361
I want you to come.

01:37:24.439 --> 01:37:26.407
I can't.

01:37:27.776 --> 01:37:30.267
I've got a girlfriend.

01:37:30.345 --> 01:37:32.779
I think she might be the one.

01:37:32.847 --> 01:37:35.577
Plus I'm thinking
of opening my own place.

01:37:35.650 --> 01:37:38.642
Maybe this trip will help.
It's good money.

01:37:41.389 --> 01:37:43.653
Yuri...

01:37:43.725 --> 01:37:45.659
I've given my word.

01:37:45.727 --> 01:37:47.217
No one has to know.

01:37:47.295 --> 01:37:49.320
We'll tell them we're going
for a little R&R.

01:37:52.734 --> 01:37:54.702
What do you need me for
all of a sudden?

01:37:54.769 --> 01:37:57.169
West Africa's fucked up.

01:37:57.238 --> 01:37:59.468
More than usual.

01:37:59.541 --> 01:38:01.771
I can't trust anybody.

01:38:04.479 --> 01:38:06.674
I need you to watch my back.

01:38:44.919 --> 01:38:47.410
Yuri.

01:38:48.857 --> 01:38:50.916
Welcome back.

01:38:50.992 --> 01:38:53.552
Welcome, both of you.

01:38:53.628 --> 01:38:55.357
Welcome to democracy.

01:38:55.430 --> 01:38:57.796
Democracy?
What have you been drinking, Andy?

01:38:57.866 --> 01:38:59.993
You have not seen the news.

01:39:00.068 --> 01:39:02.400
You know, they accuse me
of rigging elections.

01:39:02.470 --> 01:39:05.439
But after this,
with your Florida

01:39:05.506 --> 01:39:07.872
and your Supreme Court
of kangaroos, now

01:39:07.942 --> 01:39:10.172
the US must shut up forever.

01:39:10.245 --> 01:39:12.611
(laughs)

01:39:14.716 --> 01:39:17.014
How do you do this, Yuri, huh?

01:39:18.152 --> 01:39:19.813
How do you do this

01:39:19.888 --> 01:39:22.982
when they are watching
all of my airspace?

01:39:23.057 --> 01:39:25.753
- Where there's a will there's a weapon.
- (laughs)

01:39:25.827 --> 01:39:28.125
Come on, where's my fucking money?

01:39:32.667 --> 01:39:34.635
When it is delivered.

01:39:36.037 --> 01:39:38.699
- It is delivered.
- This is not for me.

01:39:38.773 --> 01:39:41.105
This is for my neighbors to the west.

01:39:41.175 --> 01:39:43.143
<i>Vitaly:
The west?</i>

01:39:43.211 --> 01:39:45.873
We're going to Sierra Leone.

01:39:45.947 --> 01:39:48.381
Oh yes.
And my son,

01:39:48.449 --> 01:39:50.144
Baptiste Jr. Will go with you

01:39:50.218 --> 01:39:52.243
<i>to make the proper introductions.</i>

01:39:52.320 --> 01:39:55.585
- We have no trucks.
- You will...

01:39:55.657 --> 01:39:59.525
as soon as we get
the food out of them.

01:40:04.232 --> 01:40:06.029
The gun of Rambo.

01:40:06.100 --> 01:40:09.536
Mr. Yuri, you are a man
of your word.

01:40:09.604 --> 01:40:12.835
- So where are we going?
- RUF.

01:40:12.907 --> 01:40:15.034
The Freedom Fighters.

01:40:15.109 --> 01:40:16.371
- (laughing)
- (gunfire)

01:40:16.444 --> 01:40:19.902
<i>Yuri: Every faction in Africa calls
themselves by these noble names</i>

01:40:19.981 --> 01:40:22.074
<i>Liberation-this,
Patriotic-that,</i>

01:40:22.150 --> 01:40:24.050
<i>Democratic Republic
of something-or-other.</i>

01:40:24.118 --> 01:40:26.484
Yeah!
(laughing)

01:40:26.554 --> 01:40:27.919
Yeah!

01:40:27.989 --> 01:40:30.457
<i>I guess they can't own up
to what they usually are...</i>

01:40:30.525 --> 01:40:33.926
<i>Federation of Worse Oppressors
Than the Last Bunch of Oppressors.</i>

01:40:35.563 --> 01:40:37.656
(whooping)

01:40:40.868 --> 01:40:43.234
<i>Often, the most barbaric
atrocities occur</i>

01:40:43.304 --> 01:40:47.104
<i>when both combatants proclaim
themselves freedom fighters.</i>

01:40:52.380 --> 01:40:55.645
Right, I've got 500 units,
brand new

01:40:55.717 --> 01:40:57.742
right out of the box
all as clean as this.

01:40:57.819 --> 01:40:59.878
What have you got?

01:41:08.596 --> 01:41:10.393
(woman shouting)

01:41:11.499 --> 01:41:14.195
(mob clamoring)

01:41:16.804 --> 01:41:19.329
God!
Oh Jesus!

01:41:23.077 --> 01:41:25.375
Oh Jesus!

01:41:27.815 --> 01:41:30.283
Yuri, I need to talk to you.

01:41:30.351 --> 01:41:33.149
- Not now.
- Now!

01:41:34.188 --> 01:41:36.679
Excuse me.

01:41:43.865 --> 01:41:45.890
What?

01:41:45.967 --> 01:41:48.527
- We can't do this deal.
- The fuck we can't.

01:41:48.603 --> 01:41:52.039
- What's the matter with you?
- Look. Look over there.

01:41:52.106 --> 01:41:55.166
AS soon as we hand over the guns
those people are going to die.

01:41:55.243 --> 01:41:58.906
It's not our business.

01:41:58.980 --> 01:42:02.416
They killed a boy just now
as young as Nicki.

01:42:06.988 --> 01:42:09.889
- What is the holdup?
- There is no holdup.

01:42:09.957 --> 01:42:11.481
I'll be right there.

01:42:11.559 --> 01:42:14.585
Vitaly, it's what we always know.
We can't control what they do.

01:42:14.662 --> 01:42:17.062
No no, today we can.

01:42:17.131 --> 01:42:19.099
Today we can.
Yuri, they're right there!

01:42:19.167 --> 01:42:22.534
What do you think they'll do
to us if we back out? They'll kill us.

01:42:22.603 --> 01:42:24.969
And if we go ahead,
what do you think they'll do to them?

01:42:29.677 --> 01:42:31.474
We got to do something.

01:42:40.121 --> 01:42:41.588
What is he saying?

01:42:41.656 --> 01:42:43.954
It's the, uh, deal.

01:42:44.025 --> 01:42:47.825
My brother's not happy with the terms,
but we're working it out. It's nothing.

01:42:56.037 --> 01:42:58.335
Right?
It's nothing.

01:43:04.445 --> 01:43:07.846
Yeah, nothing.

01:43:09.684 --> 01:43:11.948
You're right, Yuri.
You're right.

01:43:12.019 --> 01:43:15.011
God, I've got to get my shit together.

01:43:15.089 --> 01:43:17.557
Uh, this is not our fight.

01:43:17.625 --> 01:43:19.616
Right.

01:43:19.694 --> 01:43:22.254
Okay, what's the deal?
300 RPGs,

01:43:22.330 --> 01:43:24.298
500 assault rifles

01:43:24.365 --> 01:43:26.333
and 800 grenades.

01:43:28.002 --> 01:43:30.630
I thought it was 1200 grenades.

01:43:34.075 --> 01:43:35.736
<i>Yuri:
I was so caught up in the deal</i>

01:43:35.810 --> 01:43:38.404
<i>I never realized what
was going on in Vitaly's head.</i>

01:43:38.479 --> 01:43:41.846
I thought it was 1200 grenades.
Confused.

01:43:41.916 --> 01:43:44.316
<i>Yuri: Come to think about it,
maybe I never understood</i>

01:43:44.385 --> 01:43:46.512
<i>what was going on in his head.</i>

01:43:50.291 --> 01:43:53.624
I beg your pardon.
May I see another stone?

01:43:53.694 --> 01:43:56.595
<i>Yuri:
One thing I do understand for certain</i>

01:43:56.664 --> 01:43:59.792
<i>is that Vitaly broke
the cardinal rule of gunrunning.</i>

01:43:59.867 --> 01:44:02.859
<i>Never pick up a gun
and join the customers.</i>

01:44:10.511 --> 01:44:12.411
What are you doing?

01:44:15.016 --> 01:44:17.280
Something for Yuri.

01:44:18.519 --> 01:44:20.851
Step away.
Slow.

01:44:26.093 --> 01:44:28.357
(grunts)

01:44:39.173 --> 01:44:41.403
No, Vit!

01:44:42.977 --> 01:44:44.842
<i>No, Vit!</i>

01:45:10.371 --> 01:45:12.635
(gasps)

01:46:10.498 --> 01:46:12.659
<i>Yuri:
Only half the guns were gone</i>

01:46:12.733 --> 01:46:15.497
<i>so I was still entitled
to half the diamonds.</i>

01:46:15.569 --> 01:46:17.503
<i>If I took them, I was lost.</i>

01:46:17.571 --> 01:46:20.506
<i>If I left them, I was lost.</i>

01:46:28.416 --> 01:46:31.817
<i>The massacre played out
exactly how Vitaly predicted.</i>

01:46:31.886 --> 01:46:36.220
<i>But then a half dozen other massacres
happened in Sierra Leone that week.</i>

01:46:36.290 --> 01:46:38.417
<i>You can't stop them all.</i>

01:46:38.492 --> 01:46:40.926
<i>In my experience,
you can't stop any of them.</i>

01:46:42.830 --> 01:46:46.459
<i>They say "evil prevails
when good men fail to act. "</i>

01:46:46.534 --> 01:46:50.664
<i>What they ought to say
is "evil prevails."</i>

01:47:04.518 --> 01:47:06.452
<i>I now shared
even more in common</i>

01:47:06.520 --> 01:47:10.047
<i>with the leader of that country
God seemed to have forsaken.</i>

01:47:10.124 --> 01:47:12.888
<i>We saw something in each other
neither one of us liked.</i>

01:47:12.960 --> 01:47:15.656
<i>Or maybe we were
just looking in the mirror.</i>

01:47:35.683 --> 01:47:38.311
<i>I'd paid a Monrovian doctor $20</i>

01:47:38.386 --> 01:47:40.320
<i>to remove the lead
from Vitaly's body</i>

01:47:40.388 --> 01:47:42.515
<i>and write a bogus death certificate.</i>

01:47:42.590 --> 01:47:44.649
<i>I should have paid more.</i>

01:47:44.725 --> 01:47:47.455
<i>I've smuggled millions
of rounds of ammunition</i>

01:47:47.528 --> 01:47:51.589
<i>and the bullet that lands me in jail
is found under my dead brother's rib.</i>

01:47:53.467 --> 01:47:55.367
Yuri Orlov.

01:47:55.436 --> 01:47:58.303
We're with the Bureau of Alcohol,
Tobacco and Firearms.

01:47:58.372 --> 01:48:01.671
Let me guess. This isn't about
the alcohol or the tobacco.

01:48:37.311 --> 01:48:40.075
(phone ringing)

01:48:44.018 --> 01:48:46.987
- Crimean Restaurant.
- Papa?

01:48:53.194 --> 01:48:55.890
Both my sons are dead.

01:48:59.300 --> 01:49:01.530
<i>Yuri:
There are only two tragedies in life.</i>

01:49:01.602 --> 01:49:05.368
<i>One is not getting what you want.
The other is getting it.</i>

01:49:05.439 --> 01:49:06.906
<i>Valentine:
Is this one of yours?</i>

01:49:06.974 --> 01:49:09.772
<i>Yuri: Jack Valentine finally had
what he wanted.</i>

01:49:09.844 --> 01:49:12.711
Curiously, the death certificate

01:49:12.780 --> 01:49:14.771
says he died of heart failure.

01:49:14.849 --> 01:49:17.249
Falsifying a death certificate?

01:49:17.318 --> 01:49:19.548
That's not going to hold me.

01:49:19.620 --> 01:49:21.281
(chuckles)
You're right.

01:49:21.355 --> 01:49:23.482
As usual,
you are right.

01:49:25.593 --> 01:49:28.153
Have you seen today's paper?

01:49:28.229 --> 01:49:30.060
Huh?

01:49:35.970 --> 01:49:37.631
Fake end-user certificates.

01:49:37.705 --> 01:49:40.469
Cut-out companies,
meticulously catalogued.

01:49:40.541 --> 01:49:44.170
There is hardly a warlord,
dictator or despot

01:49:44.245 --> 01:49:46.873
anywhere in the world that you're not
on a first-name basis with.

01:49:46.947 --> 01:49:49.973
It was your wife,
your trophy wife,

01:49:50.050 --> 01:49:52.382
that led us to the prize.

01:49:52.453 --> 01:49:55.854
It's not her fault.
She's just easier to follow than you are.

01:49:58.058 --> 01:50:01.289
- May I?
- Yeah, go ahead.

01:50:20.247 --> 01:50:22.647
(chuckles)

01:50:25.719 --> 01:50:27.619
Enjoy it.

01:50:27.688 --> 01:50:30.486
<i>- What?
- This.</i>

01:50:30.558 --> 01:50:32.958
Tell me I'm everything you despise.

01:50:33.027 --> 01:50:35.689
That I'm the personification of evil.

01:50:35.763 --> 01:50:39.062
That I'm, what, responsible
for the breakdown

01:50:39.133 --> 01:50:41.693
of the fabric of society
and world order.

01:50:41.769 --> 01:50:44.294
I'm a one-man genocide.

01:50:44.371 --> 01:50:47.204
Say everything
you want to say to me now.

01:50:47.274 --> 01:50:49.105
'Cause you don't have long.

01:50:49.176 --> 01:50:51.201
Are you paying attention?

01:50:51.278 --> 01:50:54.270
Or are you delusional?

01:50:54.348 --> 01:50:58.216
You have broken
every arms embargo written.

01:50:58.285 --> 01:51:00.845
There is enough evidence
here to put you away

01:51:00.921 --> 01:51:02.616
for consecutive life sentences.

01:51:02.690 --> 01:51:04.624
You are going to spend
the next 10 years of your life

01:51:04.692 --> 01:51:07.855
going from a cell to a courtroom
before you even start

01:51:07.928 --> 01:51:10.726
<i>serving your time.</i>

01:51:12.066 --> 01:51:16.002
I don't think you fully appreciate
the seriousness of your situation.

01:51:25.913 --> 01:51:28.814
My family has disowned me.

01:51:30.217 --> 01:51:33.186
My wife and son have left me.

01:51:35.956 --> 01:51:37.924
My brother's dead.

01:51:38.959 --> 01:51:41.894
Trust me,
I fully appreciate

01:51:41.962 --> 01:51:44.055
the seriousness
of my situation.

01:51:44.131 --> 01:51:46.190
But I promise you,

01:51:46.266 --> 01:51:49.167
I won't spend a single second
in a courtroom.

01:51:49.236 --> 01:51:52.364
(scoffs)
You are delusional.

01:51:52.439 --> 01:51:54.430
I like you, Jack.

01:51:54.508 --> 01:51:58.535
Well, maybe not,
but I understand you.

01:52:02.082 --> 01:52:04.710
Let me tell you what's gonna happen.

01:52:05.886 --> 01:52:08.354
This way you can prepare yourself.

01:52:08.422 --> 01:52:10.390
(chuckles)

01:52:12.159 --> 01:52:14.024
Okay.

01:52:14.094 --> 01:52:17.188
Soon there's gonna be a knock on
that door and you will be called outside.

01:52:17.264 --> 01:52:19.926
<i>In the hall there will be a man
who outranks you.</i>

01:52:20.000 --> 01:52:22.867
<i>First, he'll compliment you
on the fine job you've done,</i>

01:52:22.936 --> 01:52:25.404
<i>that you're making the world
a safer place,</i>

01:52:25.472 --> 01:52:29.067
<i>that you're to receive a commendation
and a promotion.</i>

01:52:29.143 --> 01:52:32.874
And then he's going to tell you
that I am to be released.

01:52:32.946 --> 01:52:34.675
<i>You're going to protest.</i>

01:52:34.748 --> 01:52:37.945
<i>You'll probably threaten
to resign.</i>

01:52:38.018 --> 01:52:40.987
But in the end
I will be released.

01:52:41.055 --> 01:52:44.024
<i>The reason I'll be released
is the same reason</i>

01:52:44.091 --> 01:52:46.252
you think I'll be convicted.

01:52:46.326 --> 01:52:49.261
I do rub shoulders
with some of the most vile,

01:52:49.329 --> 01:52:52.196
sadistic men calling
themselves leaders today.

01:52:53.734 --> 01:52:55.929
But some of those men

01:52:56.003 --> 01:52:59.803
are the enemies of your enemies.

01:52:59.873 --> 01:53:04.071
And while the biggest arms dealer
in the world is your boss,

01:53:04.144 --> 01:53:07.079
the President of the United States,

01:53:07.147 --> 01:53:10.446
who ships more merchandise
in a day than I do in a year...

01:53:11.585 --> 01:53:15.851
sometimes it's embarrassing to have
his fingerprints on the guns.

01:53:15.923 --> 01:53:19.484
Sometimes he needs
a freelancer like me

01:53:19.560 --> 01:53:22.324
to supply forces
he can't be seen supplying.

01:53:22.396 --> 01:53:24.864
So...

01:53:24.932 --> 01:53:27.833
you call me evil.

01:53:29.103 --> 01:53:31.264
But unfortunately for you,

01:53:31.338 --> 01:53:33.772
I'm a necessary evil.

01:53:49.423 --> 01:53:51.823
I would tell you to go to hell,

01:53:53.160 --> 01:53:55.458
but I think you're already there.

01:54:30.464 --> 01:54:32.159
Pleasure doing business with you.

01:54:32.232 --> 01:54:35.326
<i>Yuri: Most people are happy
just to get out of jail.</i>

01:54:35.402 --> 01:54:38.860
<i>I expect to be paid to leave.
I'm not a fool.</i>

01:54:38.939 --> 01:54:41.305
<i>I know that just because they
needed me that day</i>

01:54:41.375 --> 01:54:44.037
<i>didn't mean they wouldn't make me
a scapegoat the next.</i>

01:54:44.111 --> 01:54:46.011
<i>But I was back</i>

01:54:46.079 --> 01:54:48.445
<i>doing what I do best.</i>

01:55:10.671 --> 01:55:12.832
<i>You know who's going
to inherit the Earth?</i>

01:55:12.906 --> 01:55:14.771
<i>Arms dealers.</i>

01:55:14.842 --> 01:55:18.107
Because everyone else
is too busy killing each other.

01:55:18.178 --> 01:55:20.339
That's the secret to survival.

01:55:20.414 --> 01:55:22.575
Never go to war.

01:55:24.985 --> 01:55:27.783
Especially with yourself.
