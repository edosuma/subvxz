38:51.395 --> 38:54.699

<i>"We've been targeted,"</i>

38:54.799 --> 38:57.568
<i>almost like</i>
<i>a conspiracy theorist would.</i>

38:57.668 --> 39:02.540
Like, people in the government
were watching them.

39:02.640 --> 39:06.344
- Lots of Louis Vuitton
and lots of Chanel, Gucci.

39:06.410 --> 39:07.845
Actually, that's a really nice
leather jacket.

39:07.912 --> 39:09.714
I never saw her wear that.

39:09.814 --> 39:10.815
Isn't that cute?

39:10.881 --> 39:14.251
But there's just so much of it.

39:14.352 --> 39:15.986
<i>- I was a little bit surprised</i>

39:16.053 --> 39:18.322
<i>because it wasn't</i>
<i>what I was expecting.</i>

39:18.389 --> 39:20.991
<i>When you think of Hollywood</i>
<i>and people with lots of money,</i>

39:21.058 --> 39:24.228

39:26.997 --> 39:30.401

<i>where she was found.</i>

39:30.501 --> 39:33.070
- This is obviously
the infamous bathroom,

39:33.170 --> 39:37.074
which no one has managed to
even come in and clean out yet.

39:37.174 --> 39:40.244
This is the little doggy couch

39:40.344 --> 39:41.779
where she actually fell.

39:41.879 --> 39:44.014
She fell
on Clara's chaise longue.

39:44.081 --> 39:46.016
She was put
on her side right here

39:46.083 --> 39:47.752
next to the chaise lounge.

39:47.852 --> 39:49.720
And then when
the paramedics came in,

39:49.787 --> 39:53.557
they pulled her through here
into the...

39:55.025 --> 39:59.029
Into--through the--
one of the closets

39:59.096 --> 40:01.632
into the main room, so...

40:01.732 --> 40:03.968
Yeah, you're the first people
to ever see

40:04.068 --> 40:05.603
the infamous bathroom.

40:05.703 --> 40:08.105
And it's the first time
I've come in here, actually.

40:08.205 --> 40:09.607
- You don't use
this bathroom anymore?

40:09.707 --> 40:11.308
- No, no,
I don't use it at all.

40:11.409 --> 40:14.412

40:14.478 --> 40:17.248
<i>[dark music]</i>

40:17.314 --> 40:20.117

40:20.217 --> 40:22.486
She acted like
he was in control.

40:22.586 --> 40:25.556
Like, she acted submissive
with him,

40:25.623 --> 40:27.391
which I noticed,

40:27.458 --> 40:29.293
and it struck a chord.

40:29.393 --> 40:31.128
What happens
when no one's here?

40:31.228 --> 40:33.063
Or--or how do they act,

40:33.130 --> 40:34.465
you know, when no one's here?

40:34.565 --> 40:36.567
Because I remember
going into the house,

40:36.634 --> 40:40.404
and the master bedroom bed
was all ruffled,

40:40.471 --> 40:42.173
a mess, like, both sides.

40:42.273 --> 40:45.910
And I was like, "Well, that's
weird because Brittany's gone."

40:45.976 --> 40:48.479
And it just--like, in a way
that you could tell

40:48.579 --> 40:51.615
two people had been
in that bed, recently.

40:51.682 --> 40:53.250
And I said something to him.

40:53.317 --> 40:54.652
And he said,
"Oh, well, Sharon and I--

40:54.752 --> 40:56.353
"Sharon crawls in
with me sometimes,

40:56.454 --> 40:58.322
and we just cry."

40:58.422 --> 41:00.691
And you're like,
"That's weird."

41:00.791 --> 41:03.294
Like, it is weird.

41:03.360 --> 41:05.196
<i>- She's told the coroner</i>

41:20.444 --> 41:23.147

41:23.214 --> 41:26.116

41:26.183 --> 41:30.054
<i>who had not really grieved</i>

41:30.154 --> 41:32.022
<i>But it was absurd,</i>

41:32.122 --> 41:36.494
completely absurd to even think
that Sharon and her son-in-law

41:36.560 --> 41:39.029
<i>were anything but</i>
<i>mother-in-law and son-in-law.</i>

41:39.129 --> 41:40.731
<i>She loved him like a son.</i>

41:40.831 --> 41:43.367
<i>There was nothing like</i>
<i>what had been speculated.</i>

41:43.467 --> 41:46.303
- Another thing
that was strange

41:46.370 --> 41:50.474
was Brittany left everything
in her will to her mother.

41:50.541 --> 41:53.477
- You were the beneficiary
of the entire state.

41:53.544 --> 41:55.179
Was it a sizable estate?

41:55.246 --> 41:57.214
- We haven't even begun
to add it up.

41:57.314 --> 41:59.016
- I have no idea.
I really don't--

42:01.552 --> 42:03.187
we're not doing math.

We're eating, we're living,

42:06.090 --> 42:08.492
They haven't even looked
at Brittany's estate yet.

42:08.559 --> 42:10.160
- He didn't have
any work going,

42:10.227 --> 42:12.062
and he wasn't producing
anything or writing anything.

42:12.162 --> 42:13.898
But now he's kind of
in a financial position

42:13.998 --> 42:16.333
where he doesn't have control
over any of her money.

42:16.400 --> 42:17.701
Sharon has all the money.

42:17.768 --> 42:19.737
<i>- His job was Brittany Murphy,</i>

42:19.837 --> 42:24.008
so he had to think of ways
to make money.

42:24.074 --> 42:25.376
- Where do you two
go from here?

42:25.442 --> 42:28.345
You go back East?

[both laugh]

42:31.048 --> 42:32.783
We're glued.
We need each other.

42:32.883 --> 42:34.251
- We have a job to do.

42:34.351 --> 42:36.587
It's called
the Brittany Murphy Foundation.

42:36.687 --> 42:41.058
For young people,
for education,

42:41.125 --> 42:43.193

I couldn't process it.

42:49.633 --> 42:53.270
So, within a few days,
I think either I reached out

42:53.370 --> 42:55.039

42:55.105 --> 42:57.274
I forget which,

43:47.458 --> 43:50.327
the whole thing evaporated,
