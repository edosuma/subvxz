00:03.204 --> 00:05.037
COSGROVE (over radio):<i> You're</i>
<i> with Pat "The Lion" Cosgrove.</i>

00:05.039 --> 00:08.474
<i> This Cosgrove in the Morning,</i>
<i> and, folks, today is</i>

00:08.476 --> 00:11.076
a very, very special day,

00:11.078 --> 00:13.212
because today is the day
that we get to learn

00:13.214 --> 00:16.548
all about the real
Ryan Malone.

00:21.088 --> 00:22.421
<i> Have you been</i>

00:22.423 --> 00:24.123
a politician for so long

00:24.125 --> 00:25.557
that you've forgotten
how to tell the truth?

00:25.559 --> 00:27.259
I'm not gonna lie just to tell
you what you want to hear.

00:30.664 --> 00:33.432
Are you ready
to die, Ryan?

00:45.046 --> 00:46.812
Pat.
Hey, Dave.

00:46.814 --> 00:48.047
You see the BBMs

00:48.049 --> 00:49.214
for last week?

00:49.216 --> 00:50.482
Impressive. As always.

00:50.484 --> 00:52.117
Yeah, well, number one
in my time slot.

00:52.119 --> 00:53.819
As always.
Pat, no one's ever

00:53.821 --> 00:55.821
doubted your ability
to bring in the numbers.

00:55.823 --> 00:57.256
Any coffee in there?

00:58.225 --> 01:00.292
Keep your ears open, Dave.

01:00.294 --> 01:02.394
It's going to be
a big one today.

01:02.396 --> 01:05.197
Going to be a very big one.

01:05.199 --> 01:06.565
<i> You know, Cosgrove's</i>

01:06.567 --> 01:07.833
not going to stick
to the issues, right?

01:07.835 --> 01:09.268
Oh, he gave us his word,
Nicole.

01:09.270 --> 01:10.669
Have you been listening
to him lately?

01:10.671 --> 01:12.204
He's been going
after you

01:12.206 --> 01:14.106
like you're public
enemy number one.

01:14.108 --> 01:16.208
That's his job, that's what
people want him to do.

01:16.210 --> 01:17.176
Well, I still
don't think

01:17.178 --> 01:18.544
this is a good idea.
Well,

01:18.546 --> 01:20.379
if he wants to tussle with me,
I say bring it on.

01:20.381 --> 01:22.281
I got a job to do.
Okay.

01:22.283 --> 01:23.415
You're the councilman.
Nicole?

01:23.417 --> 01:25.284
Yes?
It's okay.

01:25.286 --> 01:26.452
It's radio.

01:26.454 --> 01:28.153
I'm going back
to the office.

01:28.155 --> 01:29.588
I'll pick you up
when you're done.

01:29.590 --> 01:31.690
Good.
I'll be listening.

01:32.660 --> 01:34.593
Hi, Ryan Malone.
Pleased to meet you.

01:34.595 --> 01:36.695
(rock music playing on radio)

01:41.602 --> 01:43.602
Late night?

01:43.604 --> 01:45.604
Yeah, you can say that.

01:45.606 --> 01:47.606
Blonde, brunette or redhead?

01:47.608 --> 01:49.441
One of each.

01:49.443 --> 01:51.810
Didn't know you had the stamina.

01:54.548 --> 01:56.115
(changing stations)

01:57.551 --> 01:59.218
Rock and roll stations only,
Wordy.

01:59.220 --> 02:01.253
None of this country
and western stuff. Come on.

02:01.255 --> 02:02.421
I'm putting on Cosgrove.

02:02.423 --> 02:03.689
SPIKE:
We're working out.

02:03.691 --> 02:06.291
Can we please have something
with a beat?

02:06.293 --> 02:07.493
You've obviously never heard
Cosgrove.

02:07.494 --> 02:08.694
(over radio): You're with
Pat "The Lion" Cosgrove.

02:08.696 --> 02:10.195
This is Cosgrove in the Morning

02:10.197 --> 02:12.431
and I am joined here
in the studio

02:12.433 --> 02:15.868
this morning by my guest
Councilman Ryan Malone.

02:15.870 --> 02:18.370
It's my pleasure
to be here, Pat.
Well,

02:18.372 --> 02:20.239
we are very, very lucky
to have you here.

02:20.241 --> 02:22.491
Although, I-I have to say, Ryan,

02:22.492 --> 02:24.742
it has taken us a lot of work
to get you on my little show.

02:24.745 --> 02:27.412
Well, I'd hardly call your show
little, Pat.

02:27.414 --> 02:29.448
You're an institution
in this town.

02:29.450 --> 02:31.316
Oh, Pat Cosgrove an institution?

02:31.318 --> 02:32.551
Well, I don't know about that.

02:32.552 --> 02:33.785
But I think there are definitely
some people

02:33.787 --> 02:36.321
who probably feel
that I belong in one.

02:36.323 --> 02:37.556
<i> I just can't stand </i>
Right.

02:37.558 --> 02:38.790
this guy.
I know,

02:38.792 --> 02:39.892
his teeth are too white, huh?

02:39.894 --> 02:41.426
No, no,
I'm talking about Cosgrove.

02:41.428 --> 02:42.995
I'm talking
about Cosgrove.

02:42.996 --> 02:44.563
Malone wants to put a hundred
cops on the street,

02:44.565 --> 02:46.331
Jules.
A hundred cops.

02:46.333 --> 02:47.533
He gets my vote every time.
Yeah,

02:47.535 --> 02:49.434
the minute he gets his hands
on the budget,

02:49.436 --> 02:50.936
he starts running
those red lines

02:50.938 --> 02:52.621
through all the promises
he made.

02:52.622 --> 02:54.305
Yeah, well, you got to have
a little faith, boss.

02:54.308 --> 02:56.175
A little faith.
But I'm a realist, buddy.

02:56.177 --> 02:57.809
Yep.
Like Cosgrove.

02:57.811 --> 02:59.278
I calls 'em like I sees 'em.

02:59.280 --> 03:00.812
Oh, come on, Ryan, let's get

03:00.814 --> 03:01.847
real here, all right.

03:01.849 --> 03:04.416
Wealthy land baron Terry Malone,

03:04.418 --> 03:07.386
and yes, folks,
my guest is that Malone,

03:07.388 --> 03:09.221
has been financing your campaign

03:09.223 --> 03:10.322
from the get-go.

03:10.324 --> 03:12.357
Look, my books are wide open.

03:12.359 --> 03:13.392
(chuckles)

03:13.394 --> 03:15.360
So, instead
of manipulating facts,

03:15.362 --> 03:17.362
and trying to play
tempest in a teapot,

03:17.364 --> 03:19.398
why don't we give your listeners
a little bit more credit.

03:19.400 --> 03:20.465
Yes. Yeah.
Okay?

03:20.467 --> 03:21.800
Because I came here today

03:21.802 --> 03:24.336
because I wanted to talk issues,
Right.

03:24.337 --> 03:26.871
COSGROVE:
Ethics, you know-- ethics
is an issue, you know.

03:26.874 --> 03:28.724
Especially for you, Ryan.

03:28.725 --> 03:30.575
Okay, so you're just going to
lob vague insults at me, Pat?

03:30.578 --> 03:32.211
Is that the best
that you can do?
Oh, well,

03:32.213 --> 03:33.412
don't you worry.

03:33.414 --> 03:35.380
We'll be getting into specifics
soon enough.

03:35.382 --> 03:37.416
You're with
Pat "The Lion" Cosgrove

03:37.418 --> 03:38.634
and this morning, listeners,

03:38.635 --> 03:39.851
we have something
a little different,

03:39.853 --> 03:41.720
because this morning
we are going to be putting

03:41.722 --> 03:44.723
Councilman Ryan Malone on trial.

03:44.725 --> 03:46.725
Yes, on trail

03:46.727 --> 03:50.562
for his great
and multitudinous sins.

03:50.564 --> 03:54.399
Okay, well, this is a new low
even for you, Pat.

03:54.401 --> 03:56.768
Because today, folks,
is judgment day.

03:56.770 --> 03:59.371
Today, Ryan, we're going to be
dragging all your skeletons

03:59.373 --> 04:01.873
from the closet.

04:01.875 --> 04:03.775
And once we are
through here today,

04:03.777 --> 04:06.445
then you also will
be through.

04:06.447 --> 04:09.414
Smells a little bit like bourbon
in here to me, Pat.
Oh,

04:09.416 --> 04:11.550
that was-- are you going to
lecture me on my bad habits

04:11.552 --> 04:13.452
when you got a whole pile
of them over there

04:13.454 --> 04:14.786
all your own, Councilman?

04:14.788 --> 04:16.288
You know what, Pat?

04:16.290 --> 04:17.823
I think, uh,
I think we're through.

04:17.825 --> 04:19.491
COSGROVE:
Well, you know what, Ryan?

04:19.493 --> 04:21.326
I don't think we've really
gotten started.

04:21.328 --> 04:23.428
Why don't you sit down.
(gun cocks)

04:23.430 --> 04:26.798
I said sit... down.

04:26.800 --> 04:28.467
MALONE:
What the hell are you doing?

04:28.469 --> 04:30.636
COSGROVE:
Well, I got a lot more
questions for you.

04:30.638 --> 04:31.970
MALONE:
Put that away.

04:31.972 --> 04:33.655
COSGROVE:
Stay with us, folks,

04:33.656 --> 04:35.339
because you are with
Pat "The Lion" Cosgrove,

04:35.342 --> 04:38.844
and things here are about
to get real interesting.

04:38.846 --> 04:39.878
(gunshot)

04:39.880 --> 04:41.380
Oh, you got
to be kidding me.

04:41.382 --> 04:43.415
Who-- is that for real?
Let's not wait

04:43.417 --> 04:44.349
for a call.
You heard the boss,
guys.

04:44.351 --> 04:45.350
Let's go!

04:45.352 --> 04:46.418
Let's go!
Let's go!

04:46.420 --> 04:48.387
(sirens wailing)

04:55.529 --> 04:58.397
(sirens wailing)

04:58.399 --> 04:59.698
(tires screeching)

05:04.071 --> 05:05.904
STAINTON:
SRU has arrived.

05:05.906 --> 05:08.073
They'll be on their way up
in a minute.
Talk to me.

05:08.075 --> 05:11.076
We got one shot fired
about 12 minutes ago.

05:11.078 --> 05:12.978
They're still in studio?
Yeah.

05:12.980 --> 05:15.013
Well, as far as we know,
they're on the second floor.

05:15.015 --> 05:16.581
Radio station

05:16.583 --> 05:18.350
CPRD.

05:18.352 --> 05:20.385
Shot was fired at 9:27 a.m.

05:20.387 --> 05:22.421
MAN:
<i> I'm Dave Agonstini,</i>
<i> the station manager.</i>

05:22.423 --> 05:25.390
Nobody's gone into the studio,
nobody's come out?

05:25.392 --> 05:26.591
No.
How many entrances?

05:26.593 --> 05:27.976
Uh, just the one door

05:27.977 --> 05:29.360
and the technician's booth,
on the other side.

05:29.363 --> 05:31.396
Security cameras?
Not in the studio.

05:31.398 --> 05:32.881
Spike, we need blueprints.

05:32.882 --> 05:34.365
We got to find another way
into that studio.

05:34.368 --> 05:36.368
Tech's have a two-way mic
into the studio.

05:36.370 --> 05:38.403
But he won't answer.
I already told you.
Jules,

05:38.405 --> 05:40.706
take a look.

05:40.708 --> 05:42.708
These blinds only open
from the other side?

05:42.710 --> 05:44.776
AGOSTINI:
Yeah.

05:45.913 --> 05:47.946
Pat?

05:47.948 --> 05:49.548
This is Sergeant
Greg Parker.

05:49.550 --> 05:51.516
I'm with the Police
Strategic Response Unit.

05:51.518 --> 05:52.584
How you doing?

05:53.554 --> 05:55.554
Can you... can you hear me?

05:55.556 --> 05:56.822
There's somebody in there.

05:56.824 --> 05:58.173
What do you hear?

05:58.174 --> 05:59.523
JULES: I hear labored
breathing, but it's only

05:59.526 --> 06:01.126
one person.
One person?

06:01.128 --> 06:03.061
Yeah.
Eddie, aggressive entry.

06:04.031 --> 06:05.864
Police! Police!
Police!

06:05.866 --> 06:07.632
Don't move! Don't move!
Police! Do not move!

06:07.634 --> 06:09.634
Sam?
Got him.

06:09.636 --> 06:12.404
Boss, get word

06:12.406 --> 06:14.039
to Stainton,
lock down the building.

06:14.041 --> 06:15.574
We got something.

06:18.078 --> 06:19.678
So I take it
you're the technician.

06:19.680 --> 06:21.713
Yeah.
Where'd Cosgrove go
with Malone?

06:21.715 --> 06:22.547
I don't know.

06:22.549 --> 06:23.715
Bourbon before noon.

06:23.717 --> 06:24.883
That a regular habit?

06:24.885 --> 06:26.885
Little bit more
recently, yeah.

06:26.887 --> 06:27.919
Who fired the shot?

06:27.921 --> 06:29.921
Was it Cosgrove?
Yeah.

06:29.923 --> 06:32.924
Yeah, but-but
he didn't hit anyone.

06:32.926 --> 06:34.526
PARKER:
What happened then?

06:35.496 --> 06:37.629
It was just like
any other interview.

06:37.631 --> 06:40.065
They were just talking and-and
then Pat pulled a gun.

06:40.067 --> 06:41.099
I ran in.

06:41.101 --> 06:42.868
And then he
told Malone

06:42.869 --> 06:44.636
to tie me up.
Anything else you can tell us?

06:44.638 --> 06:47.072
He moved fast.

06:47.074 --> 06:48.507
And he kept watching
the clock.

06:48.509 --> 06:49.474
Did he say where he was going?

06:49.476 --> 06:51.143
No.

06:51.145 --> 06:53.678
No, only thing he said was
that he was sorry.

06:55.649 --> 06:56.848
Okay.

06:56.850 --> 06:58.450
<i> I set up the interview</i>

06:58.452 --> 07:00.585
with Mr. Malone's assistant,
Nicole Bennett.

07:00.587 --> 07:01.620
Is she here?

07:01.622 --> 07:03.688
Mr. Malone came by
himself.

07:03.690 --> 07:05.490
Spike, we need to find
Nicole Bennett.

07:05.492 --> 07:06.525
She's Ryan Malone's assistant.

07:06.527 --> 07:08.994
Hey, Sarge,
this is Heather Wallace.

07:08.996 --> 07:10.595
She's Cosgrove's
producer.
Hey.

07:10.597 --> 07:12.030
She says she
was in her office.

07:12.032 --> 07:13.932
I came out as soon
as I heard the shot.

07:13.934 --> 07:15.066
And you never saw them leave?

07:15.068 --> 07:16.868
No.

07:16.870 --> 07:18.837
She couldn't have.

07:18.839 --> 07:21.840
Usually Cosgrove's on a
30-second tape delay.

07:21.842 --> 07:24.576
Today he asked me to move
it up to six minutes.

07:24.578 --> 07:26.111
They were out of the building
before anyone

07:26.113 --> 07:28.013
would have heard
the shot.
You didn't think
a six-minute

07:28.015 --> 07:29.681
tape delay was a little odd?

07:29.683 --> 07:31.550
I mean, it's Pat's show.

07:31.552 --> 07:32.918
You know, like, what he says...

07:32.920 --> 07:34.186
COSGROVE (over radio):
For obvious reasons,

07:34.188 --> 07:36.555
I am unable to share
with you the details

07:36.557 --> 07:38.857
of my location,
but I would like to say

07:38.859 --> 07:41.092
that I-I appreciate
you listening.

07:41.094 --> 07:44.596
My guest here today
is Councilman Ryan Malone.

07:44.598 --> 07:46.031
What's going on?
I have no idea.

07:46.033 --> 07:48.967
Uh, well, Ryan,
why don't we start off by

07:48.969 --> 07:50.535
you sharing with the listeners

07:50.537 --> 07:52.938
just what it is that I am
holding in my hand here

07:52.940 --> 07:55.006
right now.

07:56.143 --> 07:58.143
He has a gun.

07:58.145 --> 07:59.811
He is pointing a gun at me.

07:59.813 --> 08:00.812
Yes, that is correct.

08:00.814 --> 08:02.898
I am.

08:02.899 --> 08:04.983
And unless the councilman
speaks the truth

08:04.985 --> 08:07.118
to me here today,

08:07.120 --> 08:09.154
unless he does that, I

08:09.156 --> 08:11.690
will kill him.

08:13.527 --> 08:17.596
  Captioning sponsored by
  CBS

08:46.159 --> 08:48.159
Clear.
The studios are clear, boss.

08:48.161 --> 08:50.028
Cosgrove is not broadcasting
from this building.

08:50.030 --> 08:51.897
Thanks, Eddie.

08:51.898 --> 08:53.765
COSGROVE (over radio):
...because, folks,
On our way down.

08:53.767 --> 08:56.568
today is a very,
very special day.

08:56.570 --> 08:59.638
Because today is the day
that we get to learn

08:59.640 --> 09:03.074
all about the real Ryan Malone.

09:03.076 --> 09:04.609
And you know
what, folks?

09:04.611 --> 09:05.977
To be brutally
honest with you,

09:05.979 --> 09:08.246
there's not really a whole hell
of a lot to the guy.

09:08.248 --> 09:09.981
So, it'll probably
only take me--

09:09.983 --> 09:11.683
let's say, around, uh, what--

09:11.685 --> 09:13.652
like an hour...
Oh, if

09:13.654 --> 09:16.588
in that hour, anyone attempts
to shut down this signal

09:16.590 --> 09:18.757
or interfere with
this broadcast,

09:18.759 --> 09:22.127
or interfere with my callers
in any way whatsoever,

09:22.129 --> 09:25.830
I will kill my guest.

09:25.832 --> 09:29.067
Just so we're all
loud and clear.

09:29.069 --> 09:30.735
And I certainly hope
that we are all...

09:30.737 --> 09:32.571
Jules, do you hear anything

09:32.573 --> 09:34.306
in the background?

09:34.308 --> 09:36.341
MALONE:
What is it that you want?
Because I can see

09:36.343 --> 09:37.742
that you're upset.
First of all,

09:37.744 --> 09:39.494
what I desperately want, Ryan,

09:39.495 --> 09:41.245
is for you not to try
to handle me here, okay.

09:41.248 --> 09:43.248
Because I-I've been doing
this game here

09:43.250 --> 09:44.816
for 20 years now, son.

09:44.818 --> 09:45.984
Whatever that
is worth.

09:45.986 --> 09:47.185
I'm not...
All right,
so do not

09:47.187 --> 09:49.721
try to handle me!

09:49.723 --> 09:51.222
PARKER:
<i> So where's Cosgrove?</i>

09:51.224 --> 09:53.692
Okay, the shot was
reported at 9:27.

09:53.694 --> 09:55.126
Meaning it was fired at 9:21.

09:55.128 --> 09:56.161
We arrived on
the scene

09:56.163 --> 09:57.662
at 9:39.

09:57.664 --> 09:59.698
And Cosgrove resumed
broadcasting at 9:44.

09:59.700 --> 10:01.700
So 23 minutes to get
out of the building,

10:01.702 --> 10:03.702
drive to wherever
and get back on air.

10:03.704 --> 10:04.736
Got to be downtown.

10:04.738 --> 10:05.837
He's got to be.

10:05.839 --> 10:08.006
Okay, Spike,
what do we got?

10:08.008 --> 10:10.041
He's out there
somewhere.

10:10.043 --> 10:12.877
That's a hell of a lot
of haystack.

10:12.879 --> 10:14.312
That's the station.

10:14.314 --> 10:16.247
That's Cosgrove's house.

10:16.249 --> 10:18.183
So he's got to be broadcasting
from his house.

10:18.185 --> 10:19.250
PARKER:
You want to check it out?

10:19.252 --> 10:20.251
Copy that.

10:20.253 --> 10:22.153
Sam, Wordy, let's move.

10:22.155 --> 10:24.289
All right, you are on
Cosgrove in the Morning,

10:24.291 --> 10:25.807
caller, go ahead.

10:25.808 --> 10:27.324
MAN:
I can't believe I got through.

10:27.327 --> 10:28.860
COSGROVE:
Yeah, you got through, caller.
Let's hear it.

10:28.862 --> 10:30.328
What do you have to say
about our guest here?

10:30.330 --> 10:32.030
So how's he broadcasting
in the first place?

10:32.032 --> 10:33.598
He's hijacking the
station's signal.

10:33.599 --> 10:35.165
Yeah, but how's
he doing that?
It's not that hard.

10:35.168 --> 10:36.868
Transmitters-- they
all got a network

10:36.870 --> 10:37.869
card built
into them.

10:37.871 --> 10:39.237
All you need is a URL

10:39.239 --> 10:40.405
and a password.
He could be anywhere.

10:40.407 --> 10:42.273
Can you trace the IP address?
Tried.

10:42.275 --> 10:44.242
He's using some kind
of IP spoofer.

10:44.244 --> 10:46.711
He's switching addresses
every couple of seconds.

10:46.713 --> 10:49.180
What we could do is cut him off
by switching the station off,

10:49.182 --> 10:50.715
and stop him from
piggybacking.

10:50.717 --> 10:52.384
COSGROVE (over radio):
555-0190.

10:52.386 --> 10:54.252
That is the number.
And if you are listening,

10:54.254 --> 10:55.754
I want to hear from you.
All right.

10:55.756 --> 10:57.022
That's good to know.

10:57.024 --> 10:58.256
Let me get some
more intel.

10:58.258 --> 10:59.290
I'll be right back.

10:59.292 --> 11:01.192
Okay, caller, you are

11:01.194 --> 11:03.328
on the air. You're
on Cosgrove in the Morning.

11:03.330 --> 11:04.996
MAN:
Oh, man, Pat, seriously.

11:04.998 --> 11:06.798
Are you going to waste
this dude?
Well,

11:06.800 --> 11:09.300
you know, let's just see
how it all transpires

11:09.302 --> 11:11.436
over the next hour, caller,
shall we?

11:11.438 --> 11:13.304
Because you know what?

11:13.306 --> 11:14.272
We've go so much

11:14.274 --> 11:15.874
to talk about here.

11:15.876 --> 11:18.376
Why don't we just open up
the proverbial closet here

11:18.378 --> 11:21.212
on my guest's
distinguished career.

11:21.214 --> 11:24.349
Skeleton number one.

11:24.351 --> 11:26.818
AGOSTINI:
<i> Well, if you can cut it out,</i>
<i> why don't you?</i>

11:26.820 --> 11:28.453
'Cause if we interrupt
that broadcast

11:28.455 --> 11:30.021
Malone's as good
as dead.

11:30.023 --> 11:32.991
We need to use the time
he's giving us.

11:32.993 --> 11:34.859
Okay, what I need
from you is

11:34.861 --> 11:36.861
to help me understand
what's going on with the man.

11:36.863 --> 11:38.463
(phone rings)
Should never have let him
on air, not in his condition.

11:38.465 --> 11:41.466
What, the drinking,
you mean?

11:41.468 --> 11:43.468
It's a regular occurrence?
No.

11:43.470 --> 11:45.003
Not for years.

11:45.005 --> 11:46.705
A few weeks ago, though,

11:46.706 --> 11:48.406
(phone rings)
he fell off the wagon
pretty hard.

11:48.408 --> 11:49.374
Any particular reason?

11:49.376 --> 11:50.475
Yeah. Probably.

11:50.477 --> 11:53.344
A couple of months ago,
this station

11:53.346 --> 11:55.180
and seven other affiliates
got bought up by Core Channel.

11:55.182 --> 11:57.132
I mean, it happens all the time,

11:57.133 --> 11:59.083
but I'm guessing Pat saw
the writing on the wall.
Ah.

11:59.086 --> 12:01.086
No room for him
in the new order, huh?

12:01.088 --> 12:02.754
Oh, we're moving to
music, entertainment,

12:02.756 --> 12:03.755
adult contemporary.

12:03.757 --> 12:05.156
Today was his last shift.

12:05.158 --> 12:06.157
He knew this?

12:06.159 --> 12:07.459
I didn't tell him.

12:07.461 --> 12:09.728
It's company policy.

12:10.931 --> 12:12.997
Well, maybe he figured it out.

12:13.967 --> 12:15.834
<i> What is your take</i>

12:15.836 --> 12:18.369
on Councilman Ryan Malone?

12:18.371 --> 12:20.405
Or you know what?
Or any of these fellas, really.

12:20.407 --> 12:21.906
And you know the
ones I mean.

12:21.908 --> 12:22.941
The ones with the

12:22.943 --> 12:24.275
perfect white teeth...

12:24.277 --> 12:25.777
ED:
<i> Guys,</i>

12:25.779 --> 12:28.747
he's armed, he's inebriated.

12:28.749 --> 12:30.782
And he's making a statement.

12:30.784 --> 12:32.016
So long
as he keeps talking,

12:32.018 --> 12:33.384
we got the element
of surprise.

12:33.386 --> 12:35.386
(beeping)
Okay.

12:37.357 --> 12:38.857
Stealth entry?

12:38.859 --> 12:40.058
Low and slow.

12:40.060 --> 12:41.292
Wordy, you're one.
Sam, two, I'm three.

12:41.294 --> 12:42.727
Let's go.

12:42.728 --> 12:44.161
What do you want?
What do I want?

12:44.164 --> 12:46.464
What I want, Ryan Malone,

12:46.466 --> 12:48.299
is for you just

12:48.301 --> 12:52.303
to know what it feels like.

12:52.305 --> 12:54.205
What "what" feels like?

12:54.207 --> 12:56.307
Oh, to be forgotten.

12:56.309 --> 13:00.278
To be, uh, left behind.

13:00.280 --> 13:01.780
To be the one

13:01.782 --> 13:04.849
who did not get to take
their rightful place.

13:06.419 --> 13:08.486
Look.

13:10.023 --> 13:12.056
I'm sorry.

13:12.058 --> 13:13.525
Whatever it is
you're going through,

13:13.527 --> 13:15.093
I can't imagine.

13:15.095 --> 13:16.928
But, Pat, I am tied up.

13:16.930 --> 13:18.429
Yes.
And you have a gun.

13:18.431 --> 13:20.331
Yes, I do.
So whatever it is

13:20.333 --> 13:22.000
you want to hear,
don't you think...

13:22.002 --> 13:23.468
What, you'll just go ahead
and say...

13:23.470 --> 13:25.503
Don't insult me.

13:30.477 --> 13:32.544
We get a lock.

13:34.014 --> 13:36.080
(muffled voices)

13:37.484 --> 13:39.184
COSGROVE (muffled):
Go ahead, caller,
you're on the air.

13:39.186 --> 13:40.552
PAUL (muffled):
Pat, this is Paul. Am I on?

13:40.554 --> 13:42.086
COSGROVE (muffled):
Yes, you are.

13:42.088 --> 13:44.088
The councilman only has
29 minutes left, Paul,

13:44.090 --> 13:45.957
so I suggest you say
what you need to say.

13:45.959 --> 13:48.026
PAUL (muffled):
You're not actually going
to kill this guy, right?

13:48.028 --> 13:50.428
COSGROVE (clearly):
Well, Paul, perhaps I haven't
made myself clear.

13:50.430 --> 13:53.598
If Councilman Ryan Malone
does not speak the truth

13:53.600 --> 13:55.466
in the next 29 minutes,
I will shoot him.
All right,

13:55.468 --> 13:57.368
let's see if we can find
something we can use, guys.

13:57.370 --> 13:59.070
PAUL:
I've listened to you for years,

13:59.072 --> 14:00.371
and this is not you.

14:00.373 --> 14:01.606
COSGROVE:
Well, what can I say, Paul?

14:01.608 --> 14:03.374
I'm just full of surprises.
555-0190.

14:03.376 --> 14:04.509
That is the number.

14:04.511 --> 14:06.511
(phone rings)

14:06.513 --> 14:08.513
You are on Cosgrove
in the Morning.

14:08.515 --> 14:09.881
Go ahead, caller.

14:09.883 --> 14:11.883
Hey, Pat, my name
is Sergeant Greg Parker.

14:11.885 --> 14:13.885
I'm with the Police
Strategic Response Unit.

14:13.887 --> 14:15.053
How are you?

14:15.055 --> 14:16.521
Well, as you know, Greg Parker,

14:16.523 --> 14:19.858
I've always been an avid fan
of law enforcement.

14:19.860 --> 14:23.361
But really, you know, I am just
a simple man of the people.

14:23.363 --> 14:25.630
And all I am trying to do here,
Greg Parker,

14:25.632 --> 14:28.433
is just determine the truth.

14:28.435 --> 14:30.201
Okay.

14:30.203 --> 14:32.370
I think I know what kind
of man you are.

14:32.372 --> 14:33.872
And I think I know

14:33.874 --> 14:35.273
what this is all about.

14:35.275 --> 14:38.276
Oh, really, Greg?

14:38.278 --> 14:40.478
Thinking maybe this doesn't have
anything to do with Ryan Malone.

14:40.480 --> 14:42.513
Think maybe this
has to do with you.

14:42.515 --> 14:44.549
(mimicking buzzer)
That is not correct.

14:44.551 --> 14:47.318
You see what this
is really about, Greg,

14:47.320 --> 14:50.622
this is about
the second of June,

14:50.624 --> 14:54.392
1999.

14:54.394 --> 14:55.894
On it.
(typing)
Okay.

14:55.896 --> 14:57.028
What about that night?

14:57.030 --> 14:58.396
Well, uh,

14:58.398 --> 15:02.166
I'm going to let Mr. Malone
pick it up from here.

15:02.168 --> 15:04.602
Because, uh, you know
all about that night.

15:04.604 --> 15:07.572
Don't you, Councilman?

15:07.574 --> 15:10.575
June 2,

15:10.577 --> 15:12.911
1999.

15:12.913 --> 15:14.412
And when we return

15:14.414 --> 15:17.248
we'll continue our stimulating
conversation here

15:17.250 --> 15:19.651
with Councilman Ryan Malone,
who we will find out,

15:19.653 --> 15:22.020
on top of everything else,

15:22.022 --> 15:24.589
is a murderer.

15:30.530 --> 15:33.698
COSGROVE:
<i> This, Greg,</i>
<i> is about a very special date.</i>

15:33.700 --> 15:38.469
This is about
the second of June, 1999.

15:40.073 --> 15:42.173
Sarge, Malone was in a major
car wreck on that date.

15:42.175 --> 15:44.375
Somebody died.

15:44.377 --> 15:46.177
All right, regional police
discovered the car

15:46.179 --> 15:49.247
just after 4:00 a.m.,
totaled, a rollover.

15:49.249 --> 15:51.349
It says here that a farmer
noticed the smoke

15:51.351 --> 15:52.951
from the blaze.

15:52.953 --> 15:54.686
And Ryan Malone was driving?

15:54.688 --> 15:56.421
No, he was the passenger.

15:56.423 --> 15:57.522
Cody Ackerman was the driver.

15:57.524 --> 15:59.190
He was pronounced dead
at the scene.

15:59.192 --> 16:01.125
Also in this police report,

16:01.127 --> 16:03.461
Malone and Ackerman
were at a Pi Gamma frat party

16:03.463 --> 16:06.631
that night, and Ackerman
was seen drinking before.

16:06.633 --> 16:08.533
SAM:
Jules.

16:08.535 --> 16:10.535
Go, Sam.
We found a file

16:10.537 --> 16:11.770
relating to Ryan Malone.

16:11.771 --> 16:13.004
You want to send it in
with the squad car?

16:13.006 --> 16:15.440
Absolutely.

16:15.442 --> 16:17.742
I mean, as hard as it it is to
imagine, I was young once, Ryan.

16:17.744 --> 16:19.210
I know what it's like.

16:19.212 --> 16:20.478
A couple boys going out
and getting drunk.

16:20.480 --> 16:22.413
I had a couple beers.

16:22.415 --> 16:24.649
Councilman, you were wasted.

16:24.651 --> 16:28.119
You had... you had no business
getting behind the wheel

16:28.121 --> 16:30.488
of that vehicle.

16:30.490 --> 16:32.523
You're right.

16:32.525 --> 16:35.526
That's why I wasn't driving
that night, Pat.

16:35.528 --> 16:37.128
It was Cody.

16:38.531 --> 16:41.299
He was always looking out
for me.

16:41.301 --> 16:43.301
<i> I remember that night</i>
<i> perfectly.</i>

16:43.303 --> 16:46.537
<i> He, uh, took the keys from me</i>

16:46.539 --> 16:48.439
<i> as we were leaving</i>
<i> the fraternity party.</i>

16:48.441 --> 16:50.108
<i> We were driving along</i>
<i> this country road.</i>

16:50.110 --> 16:53.311
<i> He was playing</i>
<i> with these cassettes.</i>

16:56.750 --> 17:00.651
Didn't see the turn.

17:04.624 --> 17:06.491
<i> When I came to,</i>
<i> I looked over at Cody</i>

17:06.493 --> 17:08.659
<i> and he was dead, Pat.</i>

17:10.163 --> 17:12.096
Ryan,
that's a very moving story,

17:12.098 --> 17:14.499
but, you know,
it's also a damn lie.

17:14.501 --> 17:16.518
No, it isn't, Pat.

17:16.519 --> 17:18.536
You were the one that was
driving the car, Councilman.

17:18.538 --> 17:19.904
No, it wasn't.

17:19.905 --> 17:21.271
It was you that
killed Cody Ackerman.

17:21.274 --> 17:23.158
No, I didn't.

17:23.159 --> 17:25.043
Son, unless you tell me
the truth about the night

17:25.045 --> 17:26.811
in, like, the next
22 minutes,

17:26.813 --> 17:31.349
I'm going to putting a freaking
bullet into your brain.

17:31.351 --> 17:34.152
Do you understand me?

17:34.154 --> 17:36.320
You're insane.

17:36.322 --> 17:37.555
This is about Cody Ackerman.

17:37.557 --> 17:39.524
Yeah, but what's his
connection to Cosgrove?

17:39.526 --> 17:41.292
STAINTON:
Sergeant,
Malone's assistant's here.

17:41.294 --> 17:42.527
Thanks, Inspector.
(typing)

17:42.529 --> 17:44.062
Jules, you take it.

17:44.064 --> 17:46.631
I'm gonna talk to
Cosgrove's producer.

17:48.401 --> 17:49.700
Have you been listening
to the broadcast?
Are you gonna find him?

17:49.702 --> 17:51.736
Yeah, we're doing
everything we can.

17:51.738 --> 17:54.705
Listen, do Mr. Malone
and Mr. Cosgrove have

17:54.707 --> 17:56.274
any personal history?
No.

17:56.276 --> 17:58.576
Do you know why he's doing this?

17:58.578 --> 18:01.079
Because he's a hack
with a hate-on for politicians?

18:01.081 --> 18:03.281
What about the car accident
he's talking about?

18:03.283 --> 18:05.583
Mr. Malone was in a car crash
when he was in college.

18:05.585 --> 18:07.085
His best friend was killed.

18:07.087 --> 18:10.221
Cosgrove is saying
that your boss was driving.

18:10.223 --> 18:12.323
Absolutely not.
There was a full investigation.

18:12.325 --> 18:13.825
Absolutely not possible.

18:13.827 --> 18:15.560
Okay.

18:15.562 --> 18:17.595
Have a look
at Mr. Malone's platform.

18:17.597 --> 18:18.830
Zero tolerance on drunk drivers.

18:18.832 --> 18:21.132
This is an issue very close
to his heart.

18:21.134 --> 18:22.733
Thank you, Nicole.

18:22.735 --> 18:24.268
If we need anything else,

18:24.270 --> 18:25.603
we're gonna call you.

18:28.541 --> 18:29.740
Cody Ackerman?

18:29.742 --> 18:31.642
No, Pat never mentioned him
before.

18:31.644 --> 18:33.711
Ms. Wallace, you've been his
producer for over ten years.

18:33.713 --> 18:35.580
Is there anything else you can
tell us about him?

18:35.582 --> 18:38.649
Well, I know Pat as well
as anybody at the station,

18:38.651 --> 18:40.551
but I don't really know him.

18:40.552 --> 18:42.452
Off the air,
he's a private kind of guy.

18:42.455 --> 18:44.422
Never married, no kids.

18:44.424 --> 18:45.623
He's got a brother.

18:45.625 --> 18:47.592
Lives in town somewhere.
Spike?

18:47.594 --> 18:50.228
Brother. On it.
(typing)

18:50.230 --> 18:51.229
What about the drinking?

18:51.231 --> 18:52.296
That started

18:52.298 --> 18:53.664
a few weeks ago.

18:53.666 --> 18:55.666
A friend of his
from college came by.

18:55.668 --> 18:57.602
Janet... something.

18:57.604 --> 18:59.604
You know what
they talked about?

18:59.606 --> 19:01.706
No, but, it didn't seem
like a very happy reunion.

19:01.708 --> 19:03.341
I could hear them arguing
all the way down the hall.

19:04.310 --> 19:05.576
He disappeared
that afternoon.

19:05.578 --> 19:07.612
Came back the next day drunk.

19:07.614 --> 19:09.847
Went on the air,
started trashing Malone.

19:09.849 --> 19:12.316
And he never talked
about Malone before that?
Not really.

19:12.318 --> 19:13.718
Do you know what upset him?

19:13.720 --> 19:15.670
No.

19:15.671 --> 19:17.621
I'm gonna need to see
the visitor sign-in log.

19:17.624 --> 19:20.224
Oh, sure.

19:20.226 --> 19:22.693
Spike, we got a name for you.

19:22.695 --> 19:23.895
First name Janet.

19:23.897 --> 19:25.363
Last name?

19:25.365 --> 19:26.564
Ackerman.

19:26.566 --> 19:29.300
Ackerman?

19:29.302 --> 19:30.902
So?
(door closes)

19:30.904 --> 19:32.537
Janet Ackerman
is Cody's mother.

19:32.539 --> 19:34.805
And it turns out she and
Cosgrove have known each other

19:34.807 --> 19:36.507
for more than 30 years.

19:36.509 --> 19:38.809
So Janet's son gets killed, and
she wants Pat to get justice?

19:38.811 --> 19:40.611
I don't know.
Cody was killed

19:40.613 --> 19:42.313
more than ten years ago.
Why now?

19:42.315 --> 19:45.349
Hey, Winnie,
let's send some uni's over

19:45.351 --> 19:46.617
and pick up a Janet Ackerman.

19:46.619 --> 19:47.952
WINNIE:
Copy.

19:47.954 --> 19:49.820
SPIKE:
I got a lead
on Cosgrove's brother.

19:49.822 --> 19:54.525
First name: George. I got a work
address: 505 Terminal.

19:54.527 --> 19:55.726
CJV Electronics.

19:55.728 --> 19:57.695
CJV was busted
a couple of years ago.

19:57.697 --> 19:59.764
They were selling pirated
operating systems.

19:59.766 --> 20:01.666
SAM:
How do you know that?

20:01.668 --> 20:03.534
I know because
I'm a highly trained officer

20:03.536 --> 20:05.203
on the cutting edge
of 21st century investigation.

20:05.205 --> 20:06.671
I thought it was because
you're a geek.

20:06.673 --> 20:07.838
He's not a geek, okay?

20:07.840 --> 20:09.774
He's a geek with combat skills.

20:09.776 --> 20:11.475
That's why the ladies love him.

20:12.779 --> 20:13.945
Eddie, what's your ETA?

20:13.947 --> 20:15.446
Ten minutes away.

20:15.448 --> 20:16.480
ED:
More like five.

20:16.482 --> 20:18.883
(tires squealing,
sirens wailing)

20:20.620 --> 20:22.203
Have you been a politician
for so long

20:22.204 --> 20:23.787
that you've forgotten how
to tell the truth, is that it?

20:23.790 --> 20:26.791
I'm not gonna lie just to tell
you what you want to hear.

20:26.793 --> 20:29.794
Are you ready to die, Ryan?

20:31.798 --> 20:34.298
That's just the booze
talking, Pat.

20:34.300 --> 20:37.802
I don't think you have it in you
to pull that trigger.

20:37.804 --> 20:40.871
Well, I... I suppose
we'll all find out

20:40.873 --> 20:44.909
the answer to that question
in, like, uh, 17 minutes.

20:44.911 --> 20:46.811
<i> Pat and I were in a lot</i>

20:46.813 --> 20:49.747
of classes together in college.
We were good friends.

20:49.749 --> 20:51.649
And you've kept in touch
over the years?

20:51.651 --> 20:53.651
Yes, but what he's doing
today, this isn't him.

20:53.653 --> 20:55.486
How well did Pat know Cody?

20:55.488 --> 20:59.357
Well, Pat was living on the West
Coast while Cody was growing up.

20:59.359 --> 21:01.726
They only met a few
times over the years,

21:01.728 --> 21:03.861
but I think
that Pat was fond of him.

21:03.863 --> 21:07.398
Fond enough to want to seek
retribution for his death?

21:07.400 --> 21:09.533
Well, Pat's been drinking again.

21:09.535 --> 21:10.868
I mean,
it can make people do things

21:10.870 --> 21:12.003
they wouldn't normally do.

21:12.005 --> 21:14.239
Mrs. Ackerman,

21:14.240 --> 21:16.474
Pat started drinking again
when he saw you a few weeks ago,

21:16.476 --> 21:18.226
and you had that argument.

21:18.227 --> 21:19.977
Now, did that have anything
to do with the accident?

21:19.979 --> 21:22.847
Look, I've been living with
this night for ten years.

21:22.849 --> 21:25.783
My son was vilified,
Sergeant Parker.

21:25.785 --> 21:27.652
You don't think
Cody was driving?

21:27.654 --> 21:29.987
I didn't know what to believe.

21:29.989 --> 21:31.789
But there was barely
an investigation.

21:31.791 --> 21:33.057
No inquest.

21:33.059 --> 21:34.825
By the time I got out

21:34.827 --> 21:36.661
to the accident that night,

21:36.663 --> 21:39.530
Ryan's father was already
glad-handing with the police.

21:39.532 --> 21:40.898
The next thing I know,

21:40.900 --> 21:42.733
they pinned it
all on my son.

21:42.735 --> 21:44.335
Okay, it sounds like
you have a lot of reasons

21:44.337 --> 21:46.737
to hate Ryan Malone.

21:46.739 --> 21:50.708
But you're not the one
holding the gun to his head.

21:50.710 --> 21:51.942
Is he doing this for you?

21:51.944 --> 21:53.844
Are you putting him up to this?

21:53.846 --> 21:54.912
Of course not.

21:54.914 --> 21:56.914
I never wanted
him to hurt Ryan.

21:56.916 --> 21:59.750
Then why is he doing this?

21:59.752 --> 22:01.752
Why, having met Cody
a few times?

22:01.754 --> 22:03.754
Why is he willing to kill a man

22:03.756 --> 22:05.790
who he thinks is responsible
for his death?

22:05.792 --> 22:07.091
Why is he doing that?

22:07.093 --> 22:10.895
Because Cody was his son.

22:17.637 --> 22:19.670
That's what you told him
a few weeks ago,

22:19.672 --> 22:21.505
that he was Cody's father?

22:21.507 --> 22:24.041
Pat and I were together
when we were young.

22:24.043 --> 22:25.776
It was stormy.

22:25.778 --> 22:27.044
I-I loved him, but I knew

22:27.046 --> 22:28.979
that he wasn't the
right guy to marry.

22:28.981 --> 22:31.349
I married Gary.
And Cody?

22:31.351 --> 22:33.417
It was the one time.

22:33.419 --> 22:35.820
He came in from out of town,

22:35.822 --> 22:37.888
and I got pregnant.

22:39.492 --> 22:40.758
Gary would've been devastated

22:40.760 --> 22:43.594
if he found out that
Cody wasn't his own.

22:43.596 --> 22:46.664
But Pat was all wild
and self-absorbed and...

22:46.666 --> 22:49.734
Why, after all these years,

22:49.736 --> 22:53.704
why, after Cody's death,
why tell him now?

22:53.706 --> 22:55.773
'Cause Gary's gone.

22:56.809 --> 22:59.577
And I couldn't live
with it anymore.

22:59.579 --> 23:03.547
And I thought that Pat deserved
to-to know about this.

23:03.549 --> 23:06.751
But I didn't know he was going
to do something like this.

23:07.754 --> 23:09.820
(sighs)

23:17.697 --> 23:19.029
PAT (on radio):
I see by the clock on the wall,

23:19.031 --> 23:21.532
we have just 14 minutes left,
Councilman.

23:21.534 --> 23:23.067
Ticktock, ticktock.

23:23.069 --> 23:25.469
Mr. Malone, you are running out
of time.

23:25.471 --> 23:27.405
MALONE:
I'm not scared.

23:28.975 --> 23:31.008
George Cosgrove,
nice to bump into you.

23:31.010 --> 23:32.176
Back inside please.

23:32.178 --> 23:33.544
What's this about?

23:33.546 --> 23:35.613
I think you know.

23:38.885 --> 23:40.885
Where's your brother?

23:40.887 --> 23:43.487
I don't know anything.

23:43.489 --> 23:45.823
George, you gave him the
hardware to spoof his IP.

23:45.825 --> 23:47.691
Now where is he?
No, I didn't.

23:47.693 --> 23:49.360
Okay, your
brother's taken over

23:49.361 --> 23:51.028
the station's signal
with illegal equipment

23:51.030 --> 23:52.196
supplied by you.

23:52.198 --> 23:53.664
Now that is how
he is doing this.

23:53.666 --> 23:54.932
So, where is he,
George? Come on.

23:54.934 --> 23:56.200
I don't handle
illegal equipment.

23:56.202 --> 23:57.568
SAM:
Hey, hey, hey!

23:57.570 --> 23:58.869
14 minutes from now,

23:58.871 --> 24:00.738
you're looking at accessory
to homicide.

24:00.740 --> 24:03.073
And that is a long
time, George, in jail.

24:03.075 --> 24:04.909
It is a long time.

24:04.911 --> 24:06.877
He's your brother.
You can help him.

24:06.879 --> 24:09.947
If my brother's doing this,
then he's got a good reason.

24:09.949 --> 24:11.148
He's a good man.

24:11.150 --> 24:12.950
Okay, George.

24:12.952 --> 24:15.653
If you don't help him out
right now,

24:15.655 --> 24:17.054
right now,

24:17.056 --> 24:18.622
he's a dead man.

24:20.693 --> 24:22.860
I have a place downtown.

24:22.862 --> 24:25.896
WORDY:
Where?

24:25.898 --> 24:28.732
ED:
George Cosgrove owns a condo
on St. James.

24:28.734 --> 24:30.668
It's registered
to a numbered corporation--

24:30.670 --> 24:32.703
2198 Ontario, Inc.

24:32.705 --> 24:34.805
SPIKE:
Which is why
it wasn't showing up.

24:34.807 --> 24:36.907
Sixth floor, ten blocks
from the radio station.

24:36.909 --> 24:38.642
It's where
he's got to be.

24:38.644 --> 24:39.877
Copy that.
We're on our way.

24:39.879 --> 24:40.845
PARKER:
Copy that.

24:40.847 --> 24:42.046
We're right behind you.

24:42.047 --> 24:43.246
Hey, I got something.
Take a look at this.

24:43.249 --> 24:44.615
PARKER:
Who's she?

24:44.617 --> 24:45.950
This is Nicole Bennett,

24:45.952 --> 24:47.051
Ryan's assistant.

24:48.020 --> 24:49.370
Well, they seem tight.

24:49.371 --> 24:50.721
JULES:
Mm-hmm. And when
I talked to her

24:50.723 --> 24:53.691
earlier today about
the accident, Nicole said,

24:53.693 --> 24:56.894
"Mr. Malone was in a car crash
when he was in the university.

24:56.896 --> 24:58.596
His best friend was killed."

24:58.598 --> 25:01.599
And no mention that they knew
each other at all back then?

25:01.601 --> 25:03.767
No. And she was definitely
protecting him today.

25:03.769 --> 25:05.135
She's more than
just an assistant.

25:05.137 --> 25:06.537
Yeah. She's-she's hiding
something.

25:06.539 --> 25:07.905
Okay, you go for it, Jules.

25:07.907 --> 25:09.073
JULES:
On my way.

25:09.075 --> 25:11.775
Let's go, Spike.
You drive.

25:11.777 --> 25:15.079
Hey, Pat,
it's Greg Parker again.

25:15.081 --> 25:17.181
I'd like to talk to you
for a minute.

25:17.183 --> 25:19.617
Well, you know, Greg, I think
I've been doing all sorts

25:19.619 --> 25:21.218
of listening here,
and this son of a bitch

25:21.220 --> 25:23.954
is not telling me
what I need to hear.

25:23.956 --> 25:28.259
How about we continue this
conversation in private, Pat?

25:28.261 --> 25:30.661
COSGROVE:
How about we don't
do that, Greg?

25:30.663 --> 25:33.531
I owe it to my listeners
to let them know

25:33.533 --> 25:36.000
that the same man who is intent

25:36.002 --> 25:39.603
on running for the highest
office in this city

25:39.605 --> 25:42.773
is the same man
who killed Cody Ackerman.

25:42.775 --> 25:44.208
PARKER:
Okay, well, if that's the case,

25:44.210 --> 25:45.743
then let us look into it.

25:45.745 --> 25:47.077
You've done your job here.

25:47.079 --> 25:49.280
We'll reopen the investigation,
you have my promise.

25:49.282 --> 25:50.814
I don't need

25:50.816 --> 25:52.583
an investigation!

25:52.585 --> 25:54.885
Pat, are you doing this
for Janet?

25:54.887 --> 25:57.288
Oh, she's got nothing
to do with this.

25:57.290 --> 25:58.656
Okay, sure, I understand.

25:58.658 --> 26:00.124
Oh, wait a minute.
You know, no, listen.

26:00.126 --> 26:02.993
This was all...
this was my decision.

26:02.995 --> 26:05.796
Okay? Janet had nothing
to do with any of this.

26:05.798 --> 26:07.064
Okay,

26:07.066 --> 26:09.233
but I know that Cody
was your son.

26:12.038 --> 26:15.005
And-and...

26:15.007 --> 26:15.973
Janet told you that?

26:15.975 --> 26:17.174
Yes.

26:17.176 --> 26:18.609
He was what?

26:18.611 --> 26:20.844
And she's worried
about you, Pat.

26:20.846 --> 26:23.013
She never expected that
you'd do anything like this.

26:23.015 --> 26:24.181
She wants you to stop.

26:24.183 --> 26:25.583
Well,

26:25.585 --> 26:28.152
don't you worry about anything,
Greg Parker,

26:28.154 --> 26:31.322
because I will be stopping
soon enough.

26:47.006 --> 26:50.074
ED:
All right, apartment 612.

26:50.076 --> 26:51.976
There are windows on the west

26:51.978 --> 26:53.828
and south side.

26:53.829 --> 26:55.679
Sam, grab a sniper perch,
get us eyes in.

26:55.681 --> 26:56.981
You ready?
Yeah.

26:56.983 --> 27:01.318
COSGROVE:
<i>It was a warm June evening when</i>

27:01.320 --> 27:04.021
Ryan Malone and Cody Ackerman

27:04.023 --> 27:06.824
were attending
a fraternity party,

27:06.826 --> 27:11.028
which they left
at approximately 2:00 a.m.

27:11.030 --> 27:16.033
And although he
should not have,

27:16.035 --> 27:19.903
Ryan Malone got behind
the wheel of his vehicle.

27:19.905 --> 27:21.972
I've told you.

27:23.943 --> 27:26.010
It's my turn.

27:32.084 --> 27:36.720
And like many a drunk driver
before him,

27:36.722 --> 27:41.158
<i> Ryan felt that he was</i>
<i> in control of the situation,</i>

27:41.160 --> 27:44.194
which, of course, he was not.

27:46.098 --> 27:48.766
<i> You see, folks, there was...</i>
<i> there was no reason</i>

27:48.768 --> 27:50.801
<i> for this to happen.</i>

27:50.803 --> 27:52.670
<i> No reason</i>

27:52.672 --> 27:58.242
whatsoever, except for just
plain bad judgment.

27:59.211 --> 28:03.180
<i> I sympathize, because</i>

28:03.182 --> 28:04.982
<i> I can imagine</i>

28:04.984 --> 28:07.384
<i> what that must have been like</i>
<i> for you that moment.</i>

28:07.386 --> 28:12.456
<i> You know, one bad decision,</i>
<i> and suddenly, everything...</i>

28:12.458 --> 28:15.159
<i> everything that your family</i>
<i> had planned for you,</i>

28:15.161 --> 28:19.229
<i> everything that your father</i>

28:19.231 --> 28:22.099
wanted you to be...

28:22.101 --> 28:23.867
it was all gone.

28:23.869 --> 28:29.106
Your best friend
was dead.

28:32.244 --> 28:36.113
<i> But he was also</i>
<i> the way out of this.</i>

28:36.115 --> 28:40.884
<i> And that must have been very,</i>
<i> very difficult, but, hey,</i>

28:40.886 --> 28:43.187
<i> why destroy two lives,</i>

28:43.189 --> 28:46.090
<i> especially when one of them</i>

28:46.092 --> 28:49.059
<i> was your own?</i>

28:49.061 --> 28:51.795
You drove the car,

28:51.797 --> 28:55.399
and you killed my son,

28:55.401 --> 28:58.135
and then you blamed him

28:58.137 --> 29:00.204
for his own death?

29:01.173 --> 29:03.240
(crying)

29:05.177 --> 29:07.244
That's not what happened.

29:10.249 --> 29:13.250
I should have stopped Cody
from getting behind the wheel.

29:13.252 --> 29:17.154
If you want me to apologize
for that, then I do, Pat.

29:17.156 --> 29:20.090
I swear to God,
I apologize.

29:24.230 --> 29:26.463
God, do you think
I haven't lived with this?

29:28.167 --> 29:32.136
I have. I've lived with this...
mistake,

29:32.138 --> 29:34.838
that night every single day
of my life,

29:34.840 --> 29:37.407
and I've been trying
to atone.

29:37.409 --> 29:39.476
(laughing)

29:41.147 --> 29:42.880
Oh, my God.

29:42.882 --> 29:45.249
Is everybody listening
to the same broadcast

29:45.251 --> 29:46.517
that I'm listening to?

29:46.519 --> 29:48.185
Because this is becoming, like,

29:48.187 --> 29:51.321
a full-on festival
of self-pity here.

29:51.323 --> 29:52.790
Oh, my God.

29:52.792 --> 29:55.125
The man who would be
mayor has the gall

29:55.127 --> 29:57.227
to look at me
and say, "Oh, no.

29:57.229 --> 30:00.430
"Mr. Cosgrove, I was the victim
of this tragedy.

30:00.432 --> 30:02.099
I was not its author."

30:02.101 --> 30:04.268
So I have one question
for you, listeners,

30:04.270 --> 30:07.437
and that is, are we gonna
let him get away with that?

30:07.439 --> 30:09.406
555-0190.
That is the number.

30:09.408 --> 30:10.841
The gloves are off.

30:10.843 --> 30:12.476
(phone ringing)
Let's talk.

30:12.478 --> 30:16.246
Are we gonna let Ryan Malone
get away with this?

30:16.248 --> 30:18.482
All right, caller,
you're on the air.

30:18.484 --> 30:20.250
MAN:
I'm with you.

30:20.252 --> 30:22.019
<i> The politicians</i>
<i> are all lying scum.</i>

30:22.021 --> 30:23.253
<i> Shoot him right now!</i>

30:23.255 --> 30:24.354
COSGROVE:
<i> Ooh, ooh, easy, Jeremy.</i>

30:24.356 --> 30:25.889
<i> Six minutes left on the clock.</i>

30:25.890 --> 30:27.423
<i> Let's not get ahead</i>
<i> of ourselves.</i>

30:27.426 --> 30:31.161
<i> 555-0190.</i>
<i> That is the number.</i>

30:31.163 --> 30:34.298
Sam, got a visual?

30:34.300 --> 30:36.233
I can't get an angle
on the west side,

30:36.235 --> 30:38.335
and the south side is blocked.

30:38.337 --> 30:40.237
Maybe you can ask him

30:40.239 --> 30:42.573
to open his curtains
a little bit for me, boss.

30:42.575 --> 30:45.943
(tires squealing,
siren wailing)

30:45.945 --> 30:48.011
(tires screeching)

30:49.315 --> 30:50.948
You really want
to help your boss?

30:50.950 --> 30:52.950
You're listening to this?
You got to do something.

30:52.952 --> 30:54.418
I need you to stop
wasting my time.

30:54.420 --> 30:58.088
You, Cody and Ryan all
went to school together.

30:58.090 --> 30:59.923
Okay. So?

30:59.925 --> 31:01.925
I need the whole story.

31:01.927 --> 31:04.261
You know who was driving
in the car that night.

31:04.263 --> 31:05.462
No, I don't.
Ryan said that...

31:05.464 --> 31:07.731
I think
that you do.

31:07.732 --> 31:09.999
An eyewitness said that you left
the party with Ryan and Cody.

31:10.002 --> 31:11.235
Yeah, some drunk frat boy.

31:11.237 --> 31:12.302
He kept changing his story.

31:12.304 --> 31:13.971
Nicole,
was his account dismissed

31:13.973 --> 31:16.073
because it was buried
by your boss's dad?

31:16.075 --> 31:17.591
No, because he was drunk.

31:17.592 --> 31:19.108
How could he remember what
really happened that night?

31:19.111 --> 31:20.277
And so were you
and your friends.

31:20.279 --> 31:21.245
I could ask you the same thing.

31:21.247 --> 31:22.479
There was
a full investigation.

31:22.481 --> 31:24.047
Cosgrove is going to kill him

31:24.049 --> 31:25.349
in five minutes.

31:25.351 --> 31:27.317
Now, you want to stand
around here and just

31:27.319 --> 31:28.318
listen to that happen?

31:28.320 --> 31:30.387
Then get in there.

31:30.389 --> 31:32.089
Stop him.
Shoot him, please.

31:32.091 --> 31:34.057
No. I need you

31:34.059 --> 31:36.894
to tell me the truth
so we don't have to.

31:40.266 --> 31:43.333
(sirens wailing)

31:50.209 --> 31:52.342
JULES:
Hey, Sarge, I got the real story
from Nicole Bennett.

31:52.344 --> 31:54.194
Go ahead, Jules.

31:54.195 --> 31:56.045
All right, there's a whole
other side to what happened.

31:56.048 --> 31:58.382
It's beyond just Malone
and Cody Ackerman.

31:58.384 --> 32:00.250
You gotta let him go, Pat.

32:00.252 --> 32:01.919
Come on, he says he's innocent.

32:01.920 --> 32:03.587
Well, let's just hope
there's a little more justice

32:03.589 --> 32:06.423
left in the world than that.

32:06.425 --> 32:08.458
Next caller, you're on Cosgrove
in the Morning, go ahead.

32:08.460 --> 32:10.327
PARKER:
Pat, please!

32:10.329 --> 32:11.995
Come out!

32:11.997 --> 32:13.363
Your boy wouldn't want this!

32:13.365 --> 32:17.334
Well, Greg,
you never knew my boy.

32:17.336 --> 32:18.535
Neither did you, Pat.

32:18.537 --> 32:20.971
Shut up, Ryan.

32:20.973 --> 32:23.540
Cody Ackerman
was my friend

32:23.542 --> 32:25.509
and you want to know
what I know about him, Pat?

32:25.511 --> 32:27.544
He had a dad.

32:27.546 --> 32:31.281
I'm not talking about the guy
that knocked up his mom.

32:31.283 --> 32:33.483
I'm talking about the man
that she chose to marry,

32:33.485 --> 32:37.321
to raise her boy
and love her son.

32:37.323 --> 32:40.357
His<i> real</i> dad.

32:40.359 --> 32:42.092
Where the hell
were you, Pat?

32:42.094 --> 32:43.660
I didn't even know...

32:43.662 --> 32:46.029
You were nothing to him,
nothing.

32:46.031 --> 32:47.497
Easy there, Ryan.

32:47.499 --> 32:49.333
I'm not sure that's where
you want to go right now.

32:49.335 --> 32:51.468
And now you want to go
all avenging angel

32:51.470 --> 32:53.470
for the benefit
of your listeners?

32:53.472 --> 32:55.405
You're a parasite, Pat.

32:55.407 --> 32:59.509
You feed off the dignity
of others for a living.

32:59.511 --> 33:03.547
And now you want to feed off
the memory of your own son.

33:06.452 --> 33:09.586
I haven't touched a drop
since that night.

33:09.588 --> 33:13.156
Cody was my friend
and I loved him

33:13.158 --> 33:15.125
and I have been fighting
every single day

33:15.127 --> 33:16.493
to make up for what happened.

33:16.495 --> 33:18.245
What about you?
We have reached

33:18.246 --> 33:19.996
the end of our show
and I would like to thank you

33:19.999 --> 33:21.298
for listening.
Look at you, Pat!

33:21.300 --> 33:24.735
Are you proud of yourself?

33:24.737 --> 33:28.005
You think this is what
Cody wants, Pat?

33:31.410 --> 33:37.047
Do not tell me
what my son wants.

33:42.521 --> 33:44.187
We gotta go in.
PARKER: Not yet.

33:44.189 --> 33:46.023
Jules?
Hey, boss,

33:46.025 --> 33:47.491
we're ready.

33:47.493 --> 33:50.527
Okay. Have her make
the phone call now.

33:54.733 --> 33:58.435
Pat, the phone's gonna ring!

33:58.437 --> 33:59.803
You wanted the truth?!

33:59.805 --> 34:01.671
You pick it up and
you'll hear it!

34:01.673 --> 34:06.476
(phone ringing)

34:06.478 --> 34:08.111
You're on the air.

34:08.113 --> 34:11.381
Mr. Cosgrove,
my name is Nicole Bennett.

34:11.383 --> 34:14.084
I'm Ryan Malone's assistant.

34:14.086 --> 34:15.252
Yeah?

34:15.254 --> 34:17.721
Only I'm not just his assistant.

34:17.723 --> 34:21.358
I was there
the night of the accident.

34:21.360 --> 34:23.193
I was there.

34:23.195 --> 34:26.163
I was in the car.

34:26.165 --> 34:30.200
And I just want you to know
that your son, Cody,

34:30.202 --> 34:32.469
he wasn't driving.

34:35.441 --> 34:39.443
Well, thank you, Nicole.

34:39.445 --> 34:41.711
Thank you for that.

34:41.713 --> 34:45.248
But Mr. Malone
wasn't driving either.

34:45.250 --> 34:47.517
We were all at that party.

34:47.519 --> 34:49.820
(crying)

34:49.822 --> 34:54.357
<i> I... I honestly thought</i>
<i> that I was okay.</i>

34:54.359 --> 34:56.526
<i>We were only going a few miles.</i>

34:56.528 --> 34:58.395
<i> It was late.</i>

34:58.397 --> 35:00.797
<i> There was nobody on the road.</i>

35:00.799 --> 35:04.201
<i> Cody was in the front seat.</i>

35:04.203 --> 35:08.872
He didn't have his belt on.

35:08.874 --> 35:13.844
<i> He was turned around</i>
<i> talking to Ryan in the back.</i>

35:13.846 --> 35:16.213
(chattering)

35:16.215 --> 35:18.115
<i> I missed a curve.</i>

35:19.518 --> 35:21.718
<i> I was going too fast.</i>

35:21.720 --> 35:24.888
Cody was dead.

35:30.729 --> 35:32.729
<i> He... he was my boyfriend</i>

35:32.731 --> 35:35.532
<i> and I loved him</i>
<i> and I'd killed him.</i>

35:36.668 --> 35:40.437
<i> God, we were so scared,</i>
<i> Mr. Cosgrove.</i>

35:40.439 --> 35:45.675
<i> Ryan said,</i>
<i> "Put him behind the wheel."</i>

35:45.677 --> 35:47.444
<i> I said no,</i>

35:47.446 --> 35:50.647
<i> but he said Cody</i>
<i> would've wanted it that way.</i>

35:50.649 --> 35:53.783
<i> He... he would've wanted</i>
<i> to protect me.</i>

35:53.785 --> 35:56.720
<i> He wouldn't have</i>
<i> wanted me to wreck my life.</i>

35:58.690 --> 36:02.192
(Nicole sobbing)

36:14.173 --> 36:16.239
(flames crackling)

36:22.181 --> 36:24.681
<i> Ryan told me</i>
<i> he'd take care of it.</i>

36:24.683 --> 36:26.249
<i> That I shouldn't be involved.</i>

36:32.691 --> 36:36.259
<i> All Ryan ever wanted to do</i>
<i> was protect me.</i>

36:42.568 --> 36:46.670
I-I'm so sorry.

36:46.672 --> 36:49.673
You didn't drive the car?

36:52.544 --> 36:54.511
My son didn't drive the car?

36:56.481 --> 36:58.715
No, he didn't, sir.

36:58.717 --> 37:02.686
But you let him take
the blame for that?

37:03.655 --> 37:06.456
He loved Nicole.

37:06.458 --> 37:10.527
I know that he wouldn't have
wanted her to pay for this.

37:13.465 --> 37:18.001
He was that kind of guy,
your son.

37:23.442 --> 37:26.443
Well, I'm sorry.

37:26.445 --> 37:28.778
(crying)

37:28.780 --> 37:32.549
I wish, uh, I wish
I would've known my boy.

37:36.989 --> 37:39.723
Or maybe that's better
that he didn't know me.

37:42.794 --> 37:44.294
What are you doing, Pat?

37:44.296 --> 37:47.430
I was just trying
to set one thing right.

37:47.432 --> 37:49.766
Pat...

37:49.768 --> 37:50.767
On my call, Eddie.

37:50.769 --> 37:52.736
COSGROVE:
Sorry, Cody.
Wordy.

37:52.738 --> 37:54.471
(Cosgrove sniffles)

37:54.473 --> 37:57.774
This is Pat "The Lion" Cosgrove
signing off.

37:57.776 --> 37:58.742
Pat, what are you doing?

37:58.744 --> 38:00.377
Pat?

38:00.379 --> 38:01.845
Go!

38:01.847 --> 38:03.780
(low, distorted):
Stay right there!

38:05.517 --> 38:06.783
(normal voice):
Freeze! Stay right there!

38:06.785 --> 38:08.518
Right there!
Right there!
Don't move!

38:08.520 --> 38:11.888
(indistinct shouting)

38:23.635 --> 38:26.703
(guitar plays gentle intro)

38:30.942 --> 38:33.009
JULES:
Yeah, she's on her way.

38:47.659 --> 38:51.328
¶ It seems so far away ¶

38:51.330 --> 38:52.829
(gasps)

38:52.831 --> 38:54.698
Oh, no, wait, please,
I have to see him.

38:54.700 --> 38:56.566
You have to let me
through, please.

38:56.568 --> 38:58.635
Oh, God.

38:59.838 --> 39:01.771
¶ And the future's right here
in the air ¶

39:01.773 --> 39:03.406
I'm sorry.

39:03.408 --> 39:05.809
It's not your
fault who I am.

39:05.811 --> 39:10.613
Your son would not have had
a problem with who you are.

39:10.615 --> 39:13.516
¶ Maybe I'm wondering ¶

39:13.518 --> 39:18.822
¶ If I follow the sound
of my voice ¶

39:18.824 --> 39:20.924
¶ And I ¶

39:20.926 --> 39:25.695
¶ Live in a world
of my choice ¶

39:25.697 --> 39:29.099
¶ That when I'm old,
if I'm lucky ¶

39:29.101 --> 39:32.802
¶ And the years have gone by ¶

39:32.804 --> 39:34.637
PARKER:
Mr. Malone?

39:34.639 --> 39:37.073
¶ I can look back and smile ¶

39:37.075 --> 39:39.743
So, you've been protecting
Nicole for ten years?

39:39.745 --> 39:41.444
We were all friends.

39:41.446 --> 39:43.546
I lost Cody. I didn't
want to lose her, too.

39:45.784 --> 39:48.918
¶ 'Cause all we have ¶

39:48.920 --> 39:51.121
¶<i> All we have</i> ¶

39:51.123 --> 39:55.091
¶ Is what we have to give away ¶

39:55.093 --> 39:58.828
¶<i> What we have</i> ¶

39:58.830 --> 40:04.167
¶ And all we need ¶

40:04.169 --> 40:08.905
¶ Is to feel it all
come back one day ¶

40:08.907 --> 40:11.007
¶ Ay... ¶

40:11.009 --> 40:13.777
Sad way for Cosgrove
to end his career.

40:13.779 --> 40:16.813
Well, it wasn't exactly
a great day for Malone either.

40:16.815 --> 40:18.815
You know, now that
he's going to jail,

40:18.817 --> 40:20.650
you're gonna have to find
yourself a new candidate.

40:20.652 --> 40:23.953
I still think he would've
been a great mayor, I do.

40:23.955 --> 40:25.188
Well, maybe you
should think about

40:25.190 --> 40:27.857
running for office
some day.

40:27.859 --> 40:30.927
What, and give up all this?

40:32.164 --> 40:33.763
Paradise.

40:33.765 --> 40:35.165
PARKER:
Whose paradise?

40:35.167 --> 40:38.134
¶ And I live in a world
of my choice ¶

40:38.136 --> 40:39.502
Hey.

40:39.504 --> 40:41.438
Hey.

40:41.440 --> 40:43.206
They arrest Malone's assistant?

40:43.208 --> 40:45.108
Yeah, they're processing her
right now.

40:49.047 --> 40:51.448
Can you believe Malone
kept her secret?

40:51.450 --> 40:52.849
Why not?

40:52.851 --> 40:54.918
He had a gun to his head.
He could've been killed.

40:54.920 --> 40:57.954
He was protecting his friend.

40:57.956 --> 40:59.989
I'd do the same.

40:59.991 --> 41:03.593
¶ I can look back and smile... ¶
