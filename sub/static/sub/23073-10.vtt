00:00.250 --> 00:02.180
Previously on "Workin' moms"...

00:02.250 --> 00:04.250
I'm a huge fan of yours,
Dr. Carlson.

00:04.320 --> 00:05.450
I'm Carly.

00:05.520 --> 00:07.060
Hi Carly, it's nice to meet you.

00:07.120 --> 00:09.060
All right, so let's get this
script into fighting shape,

00:09.130 --> 00:10.730
and we will be off to the races.

00:10.730 --> 00:11.890
Cool.

00:11.900 --> 00:14.260
I'm so sorry, my son
is in intensive care.

00:14.330 --> 00:16.329
Are you out of your damn mind?

00:16.329 --> 00:18.600
Going to the hospital
might ease your guilt,

00:18.600 --> 00:21.240
but think about what you lose.

00:21.300 --> 00:25.170
You left a very serious
taste in Stromanger's mouth.

00:25.180 --> 00:27.280
<i>You didn't let
Richard down,</i>

00:27.340 --> 00:29.240
Richard disappointed you.
He let you down.

00:29.310 --> 00:31.150
I think I ruined my life.

00:49.100 --> 00:51.430
I'm surprised you came.

00:53.440 --> 00:54.500
Okay.

00:55.670 --> 00:57.510
I'll keep this short.

00:57.570 --> 00:59.210
I...

01:00.940 --> 01:02.840
Richard, what I did
was unforgivable.

01:02.910 --> 01:04.450
I know.

01:04.510 --> 01:06.480
But I had a reason.

01:08.320 --> 01:12.250
You guys took away my only
passion, you know, what I...

01:12.260 --> 01:14.620
what I loved to do, and...

01:14.690 --> 01:17.360
and Stromanger made me choose
my baby or my job,

01:17.430 --> 01:19.690
and I'm not sure that
it was fair, but...

01:19.760 --> 01:21.400
It wasn't.

01:23.830 --> 01:25.530
It wasn't?

01:27.270 --> 01:30.410
I can't say much, there's
a lot of things at play, here.

01:30.470 --> 01:33.010
But, what Stromanger did to you,

01:34.240 --> 01:36.210
maybe she wouldn't have done
to a man?

01:36.280 --> 01:37.650
So, all I'm saying, Kate,

01:37.710 --> 01:40.220
is that if you wanted to make
a stink, you could.

01:40.280 --> 01:42.920
I don't know what that
would get me.

01:42.990 --> 01:45.650
A settlement.

01:45.720 --> 01:47.960
You don't get what you deserve
in this life,

01:48.020 --> 01:49.560
you get what you fight for.

01:51.460 --> 01:52.960
You still drink vodka?

01:53.030 --> 01:54.660
You still pee standing?

01:56.600 --> 01:58.230
I'll be right back.

02:21.860 --> 02:24.460
How do I write this without
it coming off as a threat?

02:24.530 --> 02:26.130
What? It should be
threatening, Kate.

02:26.200 --> 02:29.400
Just a little reminder, you
almost missed your son's death.

02:29.400 --> 02:31.500
Hold on a second,
Charlie didn't actually die.

02:31.500 --> 02:32.970
That woman threatened your job

02:32.970 --> 02:35.040
in the middle of a true
medical emergency.

02:35.100 --> 02:37.410
Listen up, girlfriend, you
wanna come outta this on top?

02:37.410 --> 02:39.740
I got three words for you.

02:41.810 --> 02:44.580
I'm talking to the press.

02:44.650 --> 02:47.050
- Definitely five words.
- Gross, yuck. No.

02:47.120 --> 02:48.920
You know I'm in public
relations, right?

02:48.920 --> 02:51.750
Threaten to talk
to Deborah Stanbro.

02:51.760 --> 02:53.450
Corporate lawyers hate her.

02:53.520 --> 02:55.160
Deborah Stanbro...

02:55.220 --> 02:56.790
Investigative reporter.

02:56.860 --> 02:58.260
She's their worst nightmare,

02:58.330 --> 03:00.290
and my Mah-jongg partner.

03:00.360 --> 03:02.700
No offence, Val, but I'd
rather not take the low road.

03:02.770 --> 03:04.630
I'm just gonna tell them
the truth,

03:04.700 --> 03:06.970
tell them the facts,
and let them know they hurt me.

03:07.040 --> 03:08.300
Just hit 'em with the facts,

03:08.370 --> 03:10.240
- and then you expose your heart.
- Right.

03:10.310 --> 03:12.370
- Deborah Stanbro.
- Okay.

03:19.180 --> 03:21.380
Ms. Foster, we received
your passionate letter.

03:21.380 --> 03:22.850
Good.

03:22.850 --> 03:25.390
And we recognize that last year
was a difficult one for you.

03:25.450 --> 03:26.720
Yes, thank you.

03:26.790 --> 03:30.660
But, my colleagues and I were
shocked by this document.

03:30.730 --> 03:32.260
What? But I was...

03:32.330 --> 03:35.560
Completely, emotionally
indulgent.

03:36.670 --> 03:39.200
Look, Ms. Foster, you've
achieved a reputation

03:39.270 --> 03:41.140
of being able to articulate
yourself

03:41.140 --> 03:43.340
without resorting to theatrics.

03:43.410 --> 03:44.810
But the Board agrees,

03:44.810 --> 03:48.640
this letter is disgraceful.

03:53.480 --> 03:54.620
Okay.

04:04.890 --> 04:07.700
I will go to the press.

04:10.370 --> 04:12.300
Do you know Deborah Stanbro,

04:12.300 --> 04:15.240
investigative journalist?

04:15.310 --> 04:18.510
Well, I play Mah-jongg with
her, and she has my back, so.

04:25.650 --> 04:27.320
I'm sure the Board
would be very happy

04:27.380 --> 04:28.850
if I walked out of here quietly,

04:28.920 --> 04:30.650
but I'm not sure what kind
of leverage you have,

04:30.720 --> 04:32.650
outside of shaming me.

04:32.660 --> 04:34.720
And I don't feel shame,
not anymore,

04:34.790 --> 04:38.190
not for prioritizing my son
over a deli meat presentation.

04:38.260 --> 04:39.960
Shame on you.

04:45.470 --> 04:47.840
Well, okay then.

04:49.510 --> 04:51.470
Perhaps we can agree...

04:52.580 --> 04:54.410
to part ways,

04:54.480 --> 04:57.080
amicably, and quietly.

04:57.080 --> 05:00.850
Honestly, I doubt any amount
of money

05:00.920 --> 05:03.080
is gonna make much of a
difference at this point.

05:05.620 --> 05:07.360
That is an insane
amount of money.

05:07.420 --> 05:08.860
I'm gonna get you to sign
this release.

05:08.920 --> 05:10.930
Mhm. Okay.

05:18.930 --> 05:21.640
We are celebratin' today,
ladies,

05:21.640 --> 05:24.410
'cause thanks to the advice
of Val Szalinsky,

05:24.470 --> 05:26.810
mama got herself a settlement.

05:26.880 --> 05:28.740
Woooo! Yeah!

05:28.810 --> 05:30.910
This is my way of returning
the favour.

05:30.910 --> 05:32.780
Kate, is this a stem cell mask?

05:32.850 --> 05:33.950
Yeah, it is!

05:34.020 --> 05:35.620
Whoa, aren't stem cell masks
made of like,

05:35.620 --> 05:37.990
umbilical cords, or foreskin,
or something like that?

05:37.990 --> 05:40.320
Ugh, Frankie, why you gotta
make everything so gross?

05:40.320 --> 05:42.020
What are you gonna spend
the money on?

05:42.090 --> 05:44.490
Alicia, that's none of our
business.

05:44.560 --> 05:46.530
Though, it is a good question.

05:46.600 --> 05:48.060
What are you thinking, Kate?

05:48.060 --> 05:49.700
Statement necklaces?

05:49.770 --> 05:51.870
No actually, I've decided -

05:51.930 --> 05:53.470
thanks to a very good
push from Anne,

05:53.540 --> 05:54.800
Hmm.

05:54.800 --> 05:56.400
...to go into business for
myself.

05:56.470 --> 05:58.640
- Oh finally!
- Hallelujah

05:58.710 --> 06:00.270
- What a relief!
- Long time.

06:00.280 --> 06:02.940
Guys, I'm touched. I had no
idea that you were so eager

06:02.950 --> 06:04.950
- to see me go off on my own?
- Oh, it's not that.

06:05.010 --> 06:06.950
I think we're all just glad
to hear that you

06:07.020 --> 06:08.550
and Anne are friends again.

06:08.620 --> 06:10.350
Oh, I've never felt so much
damn tension in my life.

06:10.350 --> 06:12.620
- So awkward!
- So horrible.

06:12.690 --> 06:14.090
The rage.

06:20.700 --> 06:22.760
Uh, Cher?

06:24.600 --> 06:27.370
Oh, hello, Dr. Carlson.

06:27.370 --> 06:29.300
- Carly, you're Cher?
- Mhm.

06:29.370 --> 06:32.370
- Like, the singer?
- From the movie, "Clueless".

06:34.810 --> 06:38.450
So, listen, it was so great
to meet you, the other day,

06:38.510 --> 06:40.750
and I know that we said
we were gonna go for coffee,

06:40.820 --> 06:42.580
but I just thought,

06:42.590 --> 06:44.590
why don't I book a session
and surprise you?

06:44.650 --> 06:46.120
- Okay, but...
- That way,

06:46.190 --> 06:47.720
I can pick that enormous brain
of yours,

06:47.790 --> 06:50.160
while knowing that I'm
compensating you for your time.

06:50.230 --> 06:52.760
I'm sorry, so you wanna pay
to listen to me talk

06:52.830 --> 06:54.830
about myself for an hour?

06:54.900 --> 06:56.730
Pretty much.

06:57.870 --> 06:59.670
Yeah, I mean,
I can get behind that.

07:00.870 --> 07:02.540
Good morning.

07:02.540 --> 07:04.610
- Coffee?
- Ooh, yes, please.

07:04.670 --> 07:06.670
But this is not coffee.

07:06.740 --> 07:08.740
It is better than coffee, baby.

07:10.410 --> 07:12.350
Holy shit,
is this your severance?

07:12.410 --> 07:14.010
Enough zeroes for ya?

07:14.080 --> 07:16.380
- Wow! This is insane!
- I know.

07:16.450 --> 07:19.520
Oh my God! I feel like
we can finally chill out.

07:19.590 --> 07:21.290
- I know.
- Oh.

07:21.290 --> 07:23.990
And start talking
about our second kid.

07:24.060 --> 07:25.530
What?

07:25.530 --> 07:27.760
I said, you know, talk about
havin' another kid.

07:27.830 --> 07:29.730
I... Nathan, no way!

07:29.800 --> 07:31.630
I have been waiting
for this opportunity.

07:31.700 --> 07:33.630
I can finally start my own
business.

07:33.700 --> 07:35.340
Your own business,
what are you, crazy?

07:35.340 --> 07:37.440
I mean, last year you killed
yourself

07:37.510 --> 07:38.770
to get all the way to Montreal,

07:38.780 --> 07:40.440
only to have to come
all the way back.

07:40.510 --> 07:42.310
And then this year,
you had two jobs,

07:42.380 --> 07:43.850
and some crazy personal stuff.

07:43.910 --> 07:47.080
I mean, Jesus,
can't you just relax?

07:47.150 --> 07:48.920
I'm relaxed when I'm working.

07:48.980 --> 07:51.650
Oh that's... great.

07:51.720 --> 07:53.720
What kinda state are you
in when you're with us?

07:54.920 --> 07:57.460
I'm sorry. I know how
that sounds, I just...

07:57.530 --> 07:59.560
Look, I have to go,

07:59.630 --> 08:01.200
but this conversation
is not over.

08:01.200 --> 08:02.500
Of course not.

08:02.500 --> 08:04.160
Just promise me you won't put
anything into motion,

08:04.230 --> 08:06.930
- until I get back. Okay?
- I promise.

08:07.000 --> 08:09.640
Cheers!

08:09.710 --> 08:12.370
So I'm starting my own
business, and I was hoping...

08:12.380 --> 08:13.880
I've already done it.

08:13.940 --> 08:16.240
- You-you've done what?
- Designed your logo.

08:16.310 --> 08:17.710
Oh! Oh, that's great!

08:17.710 --> 08:19.080
I'd love to see it.
Whadda ya got?

08:19.080 --> 08:21.620
Okay, great. Just remember,
these are only mock-ups.

08:21.680 --> 08:22.950
- Totally. Yeah.
- Okay?

08:23.020 --> 08:24.450
Here's the first one.

08:24.520 --> 08:27.460
Behold, Kate Foster Public
Relations.

08:31.530 --> 08:33.360
Hmm.

08:33.360 --> 08:35.700
'Cause she knocks it outta
the park.

08:35.760 --> 08:38.370
I don't know what this
is selling, exactly.

08:38.429 --> 08:40.100
Okay, uh...

08:41.169 --> 08:43.070
yeah, I can see how that
might be a bit much.

08:43.140 --> 08:45.240
Um... I'll just go ahead
and keep this one

08:45.310 --> 08:47.540
- for my personal records.
- Sorry?

08:47.610 --> 08:49.040
There's this one,
it's kinda plain.

08:49.110 --> 08:51.610
I guess... someone might
respond to it.

08:53.480 --> 08:55.820
Yeah?

08:55.890 --> 08:57.420
Yeah.

08:57.420 --> 08:59.320
Rosie, the real reason I asked
you here today,

08:59.320 --> 09:02.020
- was to offer you a job.
- Oh... wow. Where?

09:02.090 --> 09:04.660
What do you mean, where?
Kate Foster Public Relations.

09:04.660 --> 09:07.500
Oh, Kate,
I'm so flattered but...

09:08.760 --> 09:11.130
I just don't think I can commit
to a start-up, you know.

09:11.200 --> 09:14.270
- How stable can that be?
- What?

09:14.340 --> 09:16.800
What are you doing
for money right now?

09:16.870 --> 09:18.470
Phone sex.

09:19.640 --> 09:21.610
- Yeah, I'll come work for you.
- Mhm.

for to...

09:29.920 --> 09:31.750
No, please, no. Put that away.

09:31.820 --> 09:33.690
I booked a session,
and I intend to pay for it.

09:33.760 --> 09:35.890
I talked about my boring life
for an hour.

09:35.960 --> 09:37.420
I should be paying you.

09:37.490 --> 09:39.890
Well... at least let me take
you for lunch.

09:39.900 --> 09:41.760
Yeah?

09:41.760 --> 09:43.160

- Great!

09:46.340 --> 09:49.140
I seriously think you are the
coolest woman I've ever met.

09:49.200 --> 09:51.040
Tell that to my daughter.

09:51.110 --> 09:53.170
I'm sure Alice thinks
you're cool.

09:53.180 --> 09:55.580
You know my daughter's name?

09:55.580 --> 09:56.640
Facebook.

09:56.710 --> 09:58.110
Are we Facebook friends?

09:58.180 --> 10:00.250

Fingers crossed.

with each other.

Well yeah, Rosie,
what did you expect?

10:22.100 --> 10:23.340
I'm not Don Draper.

10:23.410 --> 10:24.940
What about all the stuff
you said about

10:24.940 --> 10:26.540
gettin' outta the house?

10:26.540 --> 10:29.540
Well, I did get you outta
your house.

10:29.550 --> 10:31.310

Uh, we'll start ya off here,

10:33.750 --> 10:34.880
Do I even get a chair?

10:34.880 --> 10:36.750
Do you get a chair.
Of course you get a chair.

10:36.820 --> 10:38.290
What is this, huh?

10:38.350 --> 10:40.320
It's kind of a tricky dicky,
but ya...

10:40.390 --> 10:42.360
here we go. See?

10:42.430 --> 10:44.360
Yeah.

10:44.430 --> 10:46.930
Yeah.

10:49.900 --> 10:52.470
Okay, look, she's on one nap
a day between 2 and 3-ish.

10:52.530 --> 10:53.700
Don't let it go any later
than that,

10:53.700 --> 10:55.770
because then she has trouble
at bedtime.

10:55.840 --> 10:57.740
- Yeah, got it.
- Okay.

10:57.810 --> 10:59.210
You look nice.

10:59.280 --> 11:01.340
Thanks, I have a meeting with
this studio guy

11:01.410 --> 11:02.680
he's interested in the script.

11:02.750 --> 11:04.380
I just didn't want him
to think I'm a slob.

11:04.450 --> 11:05.880
Huh, I don't think
he'll think that.

11:05.950 --> 11:07.450
Thank you. Do you have
everything?

11:07.520 --> 11:08.580
Yeah! I got it!

11:08.650 --> 11:09.980
Uh, she needs snacks between
meals, and...

11:09.990 --> 11:11.290
Just like us.

11:11.350 --> 11:13.250
Just like us!

11:13.320 --> 11:15.320
Look, it's not that I don't
have confidence in you,

11:15.320 --> 11:16.520
because I do,

11:16.590 --> 11:18.260
I've got confidence comin' out
my eyeballs.

11:18.330 --> 11:19.360
Okay.

11:19.430 --> 11:20.930
It's just that Dmitri is a lot.

11:21.000 --> 11:22.900
He's pretentious, he's weird,
he's foreign,

11:22.970 --> 11:24.530
he's an asshole.

11:24.530 --> 11:26.730
If we're lucky, he's gay,
but I'm not 100%.

11:26.740 --> 11:29.170
Okay, but he likes my script,
right?

11:29.170 --> 11:30.800
He loves your script.

11:30.870 --> 11:33.010
- Are you ready, handsome?
- I'm ready.

12:02.840 --> 12:06.110
I have problem with
the ice cream man.

12:08.010 --> 12:10.640
Uh... he's a, he's a pretty
important character.

12:10.710 --> 12:12.410
Do you mind if I ask uh,
what the problem is?

12:12.480 --> 12:14.980
Yes, I am lactose intolerant.

12:15.050 --> 12:16.850
Oh, yeah.

12:21.820 --> 12:23.320
Just kidding.

12:23.330 --> 12:25.990
I'm drinking cappuccino,
right now,

12:26.000 --> 12:27.360
as we are speaking.

12:27.430 --> 12:29.100
You are.

12:29.160 --> 12:31.670
No, but seriously,

12:31.730 --> 12:34.500
I have a problem
with the main character.

12:34.570 --> 12:38.110
Nobody wants to see a man
stay home with baby.

12:38.170 --> 12:41.380
It's not sexy.
Can we give him super powers?

12:41.440 --> 12:45.350
Maybe he can jump very fast,
or something.

12:45.350 --> 12:47.780
Oh, I like that.
Yeah, it's great.

12:47.850 --> 12:49.020
What? I-I...

12:49.080 --> 12:52.750
Maybe he has soft bones,
for crevices.

12:52.760 --> 12:54.350
- Oh, I like that.
- You should.

12:54.360 --> 12:56.690
Dmitri,...

12:57.960 --> 13:00.460
I'm sorry, but you're wrong.

13:00.530 --> 13:01.960
There is an audience out there,

13:02.030 --> 13:04.200
looking for a story
about a single father.

13:04.270 --> 13:06.030
I know this,
because I'm a single father.

13:07.140 --> 13:08.970
I wrote this thing because
I wanna see guys like me

13:08.970 --> 13:10.870
represented on screen.

13:10.940 --> 13:13.940
And if that doesn't work
for you,

13:13.940 --> 13:15.280
doesn't work for me.

13:15.340 --> 13:17.180
Uh... okay, maybe we can...

13:17.180 --> 13:19.750
I see you have some big balls.

13:19.820 --> 13:22.250
<i>Okay, maybe we
can just take a little...</i>

13:22.320 --> 13:23.620
I'm sorry guys, I gotta go.

13:23.690 --> 13:25.390
This is my baby's mother.
It's an emergency.

13:25.450 --> 13:26.690
Oh!

13:26.760 --> 13:27.860
<i>What are you doing?</i>

13:27.920 --> 13:29.790
Sit down!

13:34.960 --> 13:37.360
Jenny? What happened?

13:37.430 --> 13:39.270
- Is Zoe okay?
- Ian, I'm...

13:39.270 --> 13:42.500
I am so sorry. I just,
I ran in for a minute.

13:42.570 --> 13:44.270
They won't let me
take her, so...

13:44.340 --> 13:46.640
She had left her child
in the car!

13:46.710 --> 13:48.640
- Miss...
- While she was sniffing produce

13:48.710 --> 13:49.940
for, I don't even know how long!

13:49.950 --> 13:51.610
Hey, I think she feels bad
enough, huh?

13:51.680 --> 13:53.750
- Sir. You the father?
- Yes, hi, my name is Ian.

13:53.820 --> 13:55.550
I'm-I'm Zoe's daddy.
I've got her uh,

13:55.620 --> 13:57.280
I've got her birth certificate
right here,

13:57.290 --> 13:58.750
I've got about 1,000 pictures
of us

13:58.820 --> 14:00.150
at breakfast this morning.

14:00.220 --> 14:02.160
She says that French toast is
her favourite, but it's not.

14:02.220 --> 14:03.290
It's the maple syrup
that she loves.

14:03.360 --> 14:05.090
If I put it on spinach,
she'd eat it. Um...

14:05.160 --> 14:06.330
Yeah, okay, I got it.

14:06.400 --> 14:07.790
You're lucky your daughter's
all right.

14:07.860 --> 14:09.530
We've seen this case
turn out differently.

14:09.600 --> 14:11.500
- Hey, baby.
- Very differently.

14:31.850 --> 14:33.720
Hi.

14:34.890 --> 14:36.990
Do... I... are you...

14:37.060 --> 14:39.660
is that my haircut?

14:39.730 --> 14:42.400
I think it suits me!
Don't you think?

14:42.460 --> 14:44.600
It's like I'm your twin.

14:44.670 --> 14:46.830
Even though my hips are twice
the width of yours.

14:47.900 --> 14:50.500
Uh... I mean, in a weird way,

14:50.570 --> 14:52.140
and it is... it is weird,

14:52.210 --> 14:53.970
it's kinda flattering?

14:53.980 --> 14:56.080
I'm embarrassed,
but if you don't mind,

14:56.140 --> 14:57.840
I do have a couple follow-up
questions?

14:57.850 --> 14:59.810
Oh, so the interview's not over?

14:59.880 --> 15:02.020
So how long were you married
to Brad?

15:02.080 --> 15:04.280
How do you even know that?

15:04.350 --> 15:05.950
Facebook.

15:05.960 --> 15:08.490
I am 101% sure
that's not on Facebook.

15:08.560 --> 15:09.920
What are you up to?

15:09.990 --> 15:11.230
I'm not up to anything, Anne.

15:11.290 --> 15:12.630
You know far too much about me,

15:12.690 --> 15:14.700
even in the age of Facebook.
You know my daughter's name,

15:14.700 --> 15:16.300
you showed up with this
"Single White Female" haircut,

15:16.370 --> 15:18.270
and you know that
I was married to Brad.

15:19.630 --> 15:21.230
I just thought it would
be fun to talk

15:21.240 --> 15:23.040
about the mole on his cock.

15:25.370 --> 15:28.510
If you don't mind, I do have
a couple follow-up questions.

15:28.580 --> 15:29.940
Listen to me.

15:30.010 --> 15:32.850
You stay away from me,
and stay away from my family,

15:32.920 --> 15:35.820
or I will tie you up, and pluck
every hair from your nose...

15:35.880 --> 15:38.190
until you die of dehydration
from the tears

15:38.250 --> 15:41.060
- running down your cheeks.
- That was very specific.

15:41.120 --> 15:42.960
By the way, you should really
consider seeing a doctor.

15:42.960 --> 15:44.420
In the short time
that I've known you.

15:44.490 --> 15:45.930
I already diagnosed you

15:46.000 --> 15:48.060
with borderline personality
disorder.

15:48.130 --> 15:50.560
And a severe case of halitosis.

15:57.510 --> 16:00.440
Same fucking hair. Like I was
looking in a goddamn mirror.

16:00.440 --> 16:01.940
I was gonna kick her ass.

16:02.010 --> 16:03.580
God, watching you fight
is up there

16:03.580 --> 16:05.750
with eating dinner in bed
for me. The tops!

16:05.750 --> 16:08.020
For real, I am so glad that
we're friends again,

16:08.080 --> 16:09.750
because it is slim pickens
out there.

16:09.820 --> 16:11.250
Yeah.

16:11.320 --> 16:13.820
Use the sponge.

16:15.420 --> 16:17.890
Shit! Someone's here.
What if it's her?

16:17.890 --> 16:19.690
Oh my God, what if it's Brad
to help you

16:19.700 --> 16:21.600
with your weak-ass orgasm?

16:21.600 --> 16:23.300
Okay, I'll call
you later

16:23.370 --> 16:24.830
to let you know I haven't been
murdered.

16:24.830 --> 16:27.100
- Hey... congrats again.
- Thank you.

16:29.640 --> 16:31.100
Hello?

16:35.540 --> 16:36.840
What are you doing here?

16:36.910 --> 16:40.180
Well, Anne, I just thought
I'd swing by

16:40.180 --> 16:42.680
and check out your new office,
because I am a sweet man,

16:42.750 --> 16:44.080
who loves his wife.

16:44.150 --> 16:45.720
So you were in
the neighbourhood,

16:45.720 --> 16:47.320
and you had to go
to the bathroom?

16:47.390 --> 16:48.990
Doesn't matter why I'm here,
what matters

16:48.990 --> 16:50.590
is what I found out
when I came here.

16:50.590 --> 16:52.790
Okay, what did you find...

16:52.860 --> 16:53.990
Shit.

16:54.060 --> 16:55.800
Why didn't you tell me that
you were working

16:55.860 --> 16:59.330
next to your ex-husband,
this entire time?

16:59.400 --> 17:02.840
I'm a cuck. I'm a cuckold. Cuck.

17:02.910 --> 17:04.540
Stop cucking!

17:04.609 --> 17:06.740
Do you think that Brad
and I were...

17:06.810 --> 17:08.780
what, making out in my office?

17:10.480 --> 17:11.950
No, no, that's not what I think.

17:12.010 --> 17:14.849
- Good! Because, we're not!
- Good!

17:14.849 --> 17:16.720
I didn't tell you, because I
knew you would be upset.

17:16.790 --> 17:19.119
I'm really sorry. Okay?

17:19.190 --> 17:21.290
Okay. Okay.

17:21.290 --> 17:25.290
It's just, but the idea
of you two just sitting

17:25.359 --> 17:27.329
on each other's doctor's
couches,

17:27.400 --> 17:29.360
and giving each other
prescriptions,

17:29.430 --> 17:31.430
was driving me crazy.

17:31.500 --> 17:33.230
Lionel, the only person

17:33.300 --> 17:37.000
I want to give prescriptions
to, is you.

17:40.180 --> 17:42.410
- Isn't this...?
- Yes, do not ruin it.

17:47.650 --> 17:49.780
Oh my God! Oh my God, Lionel!

17:49.850 --> 17:52.520
Lionel! Holy fuck! Holy fuck!
Oh God...

17:52.520 --> 17:54.450
Oh my God, what is happening?

17:54.520 --> 17:56.290
What is that?

17:56.360 --> 17:57.930
Oh my God, Anne, that's amazing!

18:35.430 --> 18:37.130
I'm not a good mom.

18:39.330 --> 18:42.040
That's not true.
Everyone has their moments.

18:44.940 --> 18:47.610
You should take her.

18:47.610 --> 18:48.740
What?

18:48.810 --> 18:51.510
I don't think I was supposed
to be a mom.

18:52.610 --> 18:54.720
It's not something I ever
dreamed about, or anything.

18:54.780 --> 18:56.250
It just...

18:56.320 --> 18:58.620
just sort of happened.

19:03.130 --> 19:05.090
You should take her.

19:20.340 --> 19:22.210
So, I kinda got you somethin'.

19:23.550 --> 19:25.250
Oh my God, are they baked goods?

19:25.310 --> 19:27.480
Wait, chocolate eclairs?
No, linzers?

19:27.480 --> 19:29.050
Are they linzers?

19:29.120 --> 19:30.850
Uh, it's a form of baking.

19:30.920 --> 19:32.220
Just open it.

19:35.960 --> 19:38.460
Doesn't smell like a linzer.

19:40.930 --> 19:42.200
Pregnancy test?

19:42.260 --> 19:43.560
They're ovulation tests.

19:43.630 --> 19:45.500
You pee on a stick,
and if you get a smiley face,

19:45.570 --> 19:47.630
then we know you're fertile,
ripe, and ready to go.

19:47.700 --> 19:49.100
Why would I wanna know that?

19:49.170 --> 19:50.570
I only know when
I'm menstruating,

19:50.570 --> 19:51.870
because I have to.

19:51.940 --> 19:53.440
The rest of the cycle can
happen without my knowledge.

19:53.440 --> 19:54.670
Okay sure...

19:54.740 --> 19:56.510
But also, what happened to
not taking any action?

19:56.580 --> 19:58.650
They're just sticks.
I didn't adopt a kid.

20:00.550 --> 20:01.650
Who would that be?

20:01.720 --> 20:03.520
Ooh! Everybody decent?

20:03.590 --> 20:05.390
- Hi, Frank!
- Hey! Oh!

20:06.620 --> 20:07.890
Oh my God.

20:07.960 --> 20:10.060
- Hi, Frankie. Um...
- I know, I'm sorry I'm early.

20:10.130 --> 20:11.560
Oh, my goodness,
and it's dinner.

20:11.630 --> 20:13.730
Please, do not get up,
I am just gonna go up to the...

20:13.800 --> 20:15.800
- Love you.
- ...the guest bedroom and,

20:15.800 --> 20:17.160
it's like we're not even here,
right?

20:17.230 --> 20:18.930
But we are here! Thanks, guys!

20:20.870 --> 20:22.200
We're not talking
about these things?

20:22.200 --> 20:23.670
I sent you an email.

20:23.740 --> 20:25.540
You said she was looking
for a place to stay,

20:25.540 --> 20:27.370
you didn't tell me that you
offered her our guest room.

20:27.440 --> 20:29.280
Well, I thought it was sort
of implied, you know.

20:29.280 --> 20:32.410
I'm sorry, I should've
been more specific.

20:32.480 --> 20:35.320
No, it's fine,
I mean, I like Frankie.

20:35.380 --> 20:36.680
- Yeah.
- I just...

20:36.690 --> 20:38.490
Oy.

20:38.550 --> 20:40.620
Oh, sorry. I didn't know you
guys were eating.

20:40.690 --> 20:42.720
- I thought you'd left.
- What is... this?

20:45.460 --> 20:46.890
Hmm.

20:46.960 --> 20:49.130
Sorry, not to be rude,
but why is Rosie in my house?

20:49.200 --> 20:50.630
Hmm.

20:50.630 --> 20:52.230
Nathan, um, I uh...

20:55.700 --> 20:57.700
I may have uh, started...

20:58.910 --> 21:01.840
a small, and soon-to-be
profitable business.

21:03.140 --> 21:05.210
Is it a hostel?
