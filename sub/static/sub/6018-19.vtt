00:03.903 --> 00:06.770
Buying shoes is a challenge.
Ever see someone put on new shoes?

00:06.939 --> 00:10.398
They turn into a zombie as they start
walking around the store.

00:12.979 --> 00:15.971
"Yeah, these are pretty good."

00:17.851 --> 00:20.183
Then they have that
little 1-foot-high mirror.

00:20.353 --> 00:24.016
What is that about? So I can see
what cats will think of my shoes?

00:24.190 --> 00:25.714
What is that angle?

00:25.892 --> 00:28.827
Bum passed out on the curb,
"Hey, what do you think of these?

00:30.196 --> 00:34.064
I just got them. I've seen them
from that angle myself."

00:39.372 --> 00:42.603
That guy was amazing.
He could dunk. And he was my height.

00:43.643 --> 00:45.838
-What was his name again?
-Jimmy.

00:46.079 --> 00:49.606
-Jimmy. Right.
-I don't know how you could forget.

00:49.783 --> 00:51.944
He kept referring to himself
in the third person.

00:52.118 --> 00:55.053
"Jimmy's under the boards.
Jimmy's in the open.

00:55.221 --> 00:57.883
Jimmy makes the shot."

00:58.091 --> 00:59.786
You're just mad
because we beat you.

00:59.959 --> 01:02.052
Jerry, it's my fault.
I couldn't make a shot.

01:02.228 --> 01:05.994
These losses stay with me.
They fester, Jerry.

01:06.766 --> 01:08.199
No, this is gonna plague me.

01:13.773 --> 01:16.401
Hey, Jimmy.

01:16.876 --> 01:19.709
-Great game.
-Oh, yeah.

01:19.879 --> 01:21.107
Jimmy played pretty good.

01:23.083 --> 01:25.551
Hey, you know, I felt like we had
a synergy out there.

01:25.718 --> 01:28.414
-We were really helping each other.
-What do you got there?

01:28.588 --> 01:29.646
-These?
-Yeah.

01:29.823 --> 01:32.155
These are Jimmy's training shoes.

01:32.559 --> 01:34.550
Yeah, I've seen these things.
What, do they--?

01:34.727 --> 01:37.491
-They make your legs stronger?
-Oh, yeah.

01:37.664 --> 01:39.825
Jimmy couldn't jump at all
before he got these.

01:40.300 --> 01:41.631
Jimmy...

01:41.801 --> 01:43.632
...was like you.

01:43.803 --> 01:45.930
-They're plyometric.
-Plyometric?

01:46.106 --> 01:50.008
Yeah, they isolate the muscles.
The muscle has to grow or die.

01:52.212 --> 01:55.079
-Where do you get them?
-Jimmy sells them.

01:55.248 --> 01:56.875
-You sell them?
-Oh, yeah.

01:57.050 --> 01:58.517
But Jimmy's all out right now.

01:59.085 --> 02:02.816
Moving to Manhattan
set Jimmy back a bit.

02:02.989 --> 02:05.150
Let me give you my card.
It's got my home number.

02:05.325 --> 02:07.725
-I want to buy a pair next shipment.
-All right.

02:07.894 --> 02:09.725
All right, Jimmy,
good talking to you.

02:09.895 --> 02:12.057
-Here you go.
-Jimmy will see you around.

02:14.067 --> 02:15.796
Wait a minute, what day is today?

02:15.969 --> 02:18.904
Oh, Tuesday. Damn it,
I shouldn't have worked out today.

02:19.072 --> 02:22.235
Mr. Wilhelm called a big meeting.
I'm gonna be sweating through it.

02:22.408 --> 02:25.536
-What? You took a shower.
-It wouldn't take.

02:27.881 --> 02:30.281
Ten minutes from now,
I'll be sweating. I can feel it.

02:30.450 --> 02:33.510
-I'm a human heat pump.
-You ought to take cold showers.

02:33.686 --> 02:35.051
Cold showers?

02:35.221 --> 02:39.180
-They're for psychotics.
-Well, I take them.

02:39.692 --> 02:42.286
They give me a whoosh.

02:42.462 --> 02:44.589
-All right. I'll see you guys later.
-All right.

02:44.764 --> 02:47.358
-So, what, you heading home?
-No. Got a dental appointment.

02:47.534 --> 02:48.592
-Tim Whatley?
-Yeah.

02:48.768 --> 02:51.202
-Yeah, I got a checkup Thursday.
-How do you like that.

02:51.371 --> 02:54.272
You really shouldn't brush
24 hours before seeing the dentist.

02:56.442 --> 02:59.002
I think that's
"eat 24 hours before surgery."

02:59.712 --> 03:02.545
Oh, no, you gotta eat
before surgery.

03:02.715 --> 03:05.013
You need your strength.

03:11.491 --> 03:14.756
I've called this meeting
because we have a problem.

03:15.128 --> 03:16.356
For the last few months...

03:16.529 --> 03:18.861
...someone has been stealing
equipment from the club.

03:19.832 --> 03:21.993
Until recently, it's been little things:

03:22.168 --> 03:24.261
Bases, batting helmets, doughnuts.

03:24.437 --> 03:28.203
But two nights ago,
they pulled a big one.

03:28.741 --> 03:31.835
They took a pitching machine,
a batting cage, the infield tarp...

03:32.011 --> 03:34.639
...and all of Mr. Steinbrenner's
vitamins.

03:36.049 --> 03:39.746
Now, we have reason
to believe it's an inside job.

03:40.119 --> 03:42.610
So if anybody here
knows anything about it...

03:42.789 --> 03:45.952
...I recommend strongly
that you come forward.

03:47.000 --> 03:53.074

03:54.367 --> 03:55.959
Dr. Whatley's running a little late.

03:56.135 --> 03:58.160
Take a seat, I'll call you
when he's ready.

03:58.338 --> 03:59.862
All right.

04:21.394 --> 04:23.760
Oh, okay. Right. Thanks, Mr. Pitt.

04:23.930 --> 04:25.488
Okay. Goodbye.

04:25.665 --> 04:29.101
Hey, you wanna go see
the Velvet Fog?

04:29.802 --> 04:31.133
The Velvet Fog?

04:31.304 --> 04:33.568
Yeah, Mel Tormé.
That's his nickname.

04:34.173 --> 04:36.801
What the hell is a velvet fog?

04:37.110 --> 04:39.305
-Do you wanna go or not?
-Well, where is it?

04:39.479 --> 04:41.413
He's performing
at this AMCA benefit.

04:41.581 --> 04:44.778
-AMCA?
-Able Mentally Challenged Adults.

04:45.551 --> 04:48.577
I can't watch a man sing a song.

04:49.822 --> 04:51.847
What, are you crazy?

04:52.225 --> 04:55.991
They get all emotional, they sway.
It's embarrassing.

04:56.162 --> 04:58.357
Well, what am I gonna do
for a date?

04:58.531 --> 05:00.499
Do you know that blond guy...

05:00.667 --> 05:03.363
...who's always on the Exercycle
at the health club?

05:03.536 --> 05:05.128
-I don't think so.
-No, no, you know.

05:05.305 --> 05:09.241
-He's really handsome, with those--
-Elaine, I really don't...

05:10.510 --> 05:12.944
...pay much attention
to men's faces.

05:13.413 --> 05:16.280
-You can't find beauty in a man?
-No.

05:16.449 --> 05:19.646
I find them repugnant
and unappealing.

05:21.521 --> 05:24.456
-Hey.
-To wit.

05:24.624 --> 05:25.852
What?

05:26.025 --> 05:29.552
Elaine and I were discussing whether
or not I could admit a man is attractive.

05:30.029 --> 05:32.554
Oh, you know, I'll tell you
who's an attractive man:

05:32.732 --> 05:34.632
George Will.

05:35.168 --> 05:36.897
-Really?
-Yeah.

05:37.070 --> 05:40.699
Yeah, he has a clean look.
Scrubbed and shampooed and....

05:40.873 --> 05:42.306
He's smart.

05:42.475 --> 05:45.308
No, no, I don't find him
all that bright.

05:46.446 --> 05:48.880
-So you got any cavities?
-Just one.

05:49.048 --> 05:50.447
-Yeah?
-Gotta go back.

05:50.616 --> 05:51.605
Oh, but get this.

05:51.784 --> 05:53.718
-Elaine, you will appreciate this.
-What?

05:53.886 --> 05:56.081
I'm sitting in Tim Whatley's
waiting room...

05:56.255 --> 05:58.985
...he's got a <i>Penthouse</i>
right out on the table.

05:59.158 --> 06:01.149
-<i>Penthouse</i> ?
-Yeah, what is that?

06:01.327 --> 06:04.228
Isn't that sick? I'd be embarrassed
to have that in my apartment.

06:04.397 --> 06:07.195
-So, what's wrong with that?
-He's a doctor.

06:07.367 --> 06:09.927
I mean, it's supposed to be,
like, a sterile environment.

06:12.305 --> 06:14.705
So did you take a look?

06:14.874 --> 06:19.004
Of course. But that's
got nothing to do with it.

06:19.178 --> 06:22.614
Well, I'll tell you, I'm looking forward
to my appointment on Thursday.

06:22.782 --> 06:25.478
I might even get there
a few minutes early.

06:29.355 --> 06:30.344
-Hey.
-Hey.

06:30.523 --> 06:33.856
Hey, listen, do either of you guys
know that blond guy...

06:34.026 --> 06:36.426
...who's always on the Exercycle
at the health club?

06:36.596 --> 06:38.359
You know,
he's just really handsome?

06:39.365 --> 06:41.765
I-- I wouldn't know.

06:42.735 --> 06:44.930
You know, just admitting
a man is handsome...

06:45.104 --> 06:48.870
...doesn't necessarily
make you a homosexual.

06:50.410 --> 06:52.310
It doesn't help.

06:55.548 --> 06:56.776
All right. Never mind.

06:56.949 --> 06:58.473
I'll see you.

06:58.651 --> 07:00.949
Hey, you know those shoes
that Jimmy had?

07:01.120 --> 07:04.055
I cut a deal with him. We're gonna
import a case of them together.

07:04.223 --> 07:07.556
-What for? You got a job.
-There's a lot of money in this.

07:07.727 --> 07:09.661
He's got a proven sales method.

07:09.829 --> 07:11.626
-Yeah? What's that?
-He jumps.

07:11.831 --> 07:12.991
Jimmy's got a backer.

07:13.833 --> 07:16.063
Jimmy's jumping for dollars.

07:16.235 --> 07:17.896
Jimmy and George
are gonna get rich.

07:18.070 --> 07:19.560
Will you stop with the Jimmys?

07:19.939 --> 07:22.339
-Hey, what is this?
-Kung Pao.

07:22.508 --> 07:23.941
Hot.

07:25.478 --> 07:27.673
Kung Pao!

07:33.252 --> 07:34.651
<i>Look at me.</i>

07:35.154 --> 07:36.485
<i>Look at me.</i>

07:36.656 --> 07:38.988
<i>Come on, I'm stretching
right in front of you.</i>

07:40.693 --> 07:43.253
<i>Hey, a smile.</i>

07:43.763 --> 07:45.025
<i>We made contact.</i>

07:45.198 --> 07:48.395
<i>All right. One more stretch
and then go talk to him.</i>

07:55.174 --> 07:56.766
You know...

07:57.176 --> 07:59.770
...Jimmy is pretty sweet on you.

08:02.849 --> 08:05.283
-He is?
-Oh, yeah.

08:05.451 --> 08:07.442
Jimmy's been watching you.

08:07.620 --> 08:11.886
-You're just Jimmy's type.
-Oh, really?

08:12.058 --> 08:16.427
Jimmy's new in town.
Jimmy doesn't really know anyone.

08:16.762 --> 08:19.560
Oh, well, I'd like to get to know him.

08:19.732 --> 08:21.632
Jimmy would like to get to know you.

08:24.170 --> 08:25.933
You think Jimmy likes Mel Tormé?

08:26.339 --> 08:27.931
Jimmy loves the Velvet Fog.

08:31.744 --> 08:34.269
-Hey, Kramer.
-Well, you're looking sharp there, Tim.

08:34.447 --> 08:37.575
Yeah, well, I do what I can.

08:38.284 --> 08:40.616
-How have you been?
-Oh, fine, good, yeah.

08:40.785 --> 08:46.622
I've just been occupying myself
with some of your reading material.

08:46.792 --> 08:49.124
-So, what'll it be? Novocain?
-Yes. Yes, indeed.

08:49.295 --> 08:51.661
-Why don't we clear a path first.
-Let's do that.

08:51.831 --> 08:53.958
-You remember Mr. Thirsty.
-All right.

09:07.413 --> 09:09.745
-You too with these?
-Yeah, I'm onboard.

09:09.916 --> 09:10.974
So, what did Tim say?

09:11.150 --> 09:14.984
Well, he said I gotta
cut out the Skittles.

09:16.155 --> 09:19.056
-Looks like he gave you Novocain.
-Oh, I'm loaded.

09:19.225 --> 09:20.783
What about the <i>Penthouse</i> ?
You ask?

09:20.960 --> 09:22.393
Well, he said that, you know...

09:22.562 --> 09:24.996
...it helps his patients
relax a little bit.

09:25.164 --> 09:27.257
And he's got a new policy:

09:27.433 --> 09:28.900
Adults only.

09:29.869 --> 09:32.099
-Adults only?
-Yeah.

09:32.271 --> 09:35.240
-What the hell is going on over there?
-Well, you know, it's great.

09:35.408 --> 09:37.171
You know, no kids allowed.

09:37.343 --> 09:40.039
You don't have to watch
your language.

09:40.580 --> 09:42.878
You find the need to use
obscenities at the dentist?

09:44.450 --> 09:50.252
When they pull that needle out,
I let the expletives fly.

09:56.095 --> 09:58.427
Hey, come on, watch it.

09:59.665 --> 10:02.862
You're drooling on the floor. How
much Novocain did that guy give you?

10:03.035 --> 10:05.230
I can't hold the water.

10:06.138 --> 10:07.366
-Oh, yeah.
-Hey, Jimmy.

10:07.540 --> 10:09.940
Jimmy's ready.
Jimmy's got some new moves.

10:10.109 --> 10:12.304
-Go, Jimmy.
-Check Jimmy out.

10:14.880 --> 10:17.110
Jimmy's down.

10:24.490 --> 10:26.924
It's pretty bad, man.
Your boy's gonna be in traction.

10:27.093 --> 10:30.620
Jimmy might have
a compound fracture.

10:30.796 --> 10:32.764
Jimmy's going into shock.

10:32.932 --> 10:38.097
-Why weren't you more careful?
-Hey, I'm doing the best I can.

10:38.938 --> 10:40.735
Why are you taking it
so personally?

10:40.906 --> 10:43.568
Because if he can't jump,
there goes my sneaker business.

10:43.743 --> 10:45.335
Well, I said I'm sorry.

10:45.511 --> 10:48.139
Jimmy's gonna get you, Kramer.

10:48.314 --> 10:50.874
Jimmy holds grudges.
Let Jimmy go.

10:51.050 --> 10:54.042
You know, I can't feel anything.

11:00.326 --> 11:02.123
Hey, taxi!

11:02.294 --> 11:04.228
Taxi!

11:04.397 --> 11:06.524
Okay. Go ahead. Go ahead.

11:06.699 --> 11:09.429
You got it. He's got it.

11:14.373 --> 11:17.342
-Please, go ahead.
-No, no, you were here first.

11:17.510 --> 11:19.774
No, please, I insist.

11:19.945 --> 11:21.503
I'll grab the next one.

11:21.681 --> 11:27.381
-Let's share. We share, all right?
-Yes, let's. That's a great idea.

11:33.426 --> 11:36.259
My name is Arnold Deensfrei.

11:36.429 --> 11:40.490
-What is your name?
-Cosmo Kramer. It's nice to meet you.

11:40.666 --> 11:44.102
Very nice to meet you, Cosmo.

11:44.270 --> 11:46.204
Are you heading home?

11:46.372 --> 11:48.840
Yeah, heading home.

11:49.008 --> 11:50.532
Good for you.

11:50.710 --> 11:54.373
You're really independent.

11:54.547 --> 11:57.516
Well, you're not
doing too bad yourself.

12:02.822 --> 12:06.314
Anyway, Jimmy
couldn't be here today...

12:06.492 --> 12:09.461
...so he asked me
to fill in for him.

12:09.628 --> 12:12.529
And I'm sure
that you'll be impressed...

12:12.698 --> 12:17.931
...at what can be accomplished
after only a few short days of training.

12:18.604 --> 12:20.003
Here we go.

12:31.584 --> 12:33.347
The Velvet Fog.

12:33.519 --> 12:36.511
-What about the Velvet Fog?
-What about the Velvet Fog?

12:36.689 --> 12:39.886
Well, he's singing at a benefit,
and I'm gonna be sitting at his table.

12:40.726 --> 12:43.661
-I'm going to that.
-Yeah, I'm a guest of honor.

12:43.829 --> 12:45.023
What are you talking about?

12:45.197 --> 12:48.291
Well, this afternoon I shared a cab
with this Deensfrei.

12:48.467 --> 12:51.129
Yeah, yeah, Arnold Deensfrei.
He runs the AMCA.

12:51.303 --> 12:54.670
Well, okay. That's the guy.
He's organizing the dinner.

12:55.908 --> 12:57.466
I know that, but why are you going?

12:57.643 --> 13:02.706
Well, because we hit it off, and he was
very impressed with what I do.

13:03.783 --> 13:07.150
What you do?
You don't do anything.

13:08.087 --> 13:09.611
Well, apparently I do something...

13:09.789 --> 13:14.692
...because I'm sitting at the head table
with Mr. Mel Tormé.

13:22.268 --> 13:23.257
What are those?

13:23.435 --> 13:26.598
Oh, these are
my vertical-leap training shoes.

13:26.772 --> 13:29.673
Wait a second. Were you wearing
those shoes in the cab?

13:30.342 --> 13:32.071
Yeah, yeah. Right after I left the Y.

13:32.244 --> 13:33.802
-Don't you see what happened?
-What?

13:33.979 --> 13:37.745
He couldn't talk, he's wearing
these shoes, he's drooling.

13:39.485 --> 13:40.713
What?

13:40.886 --> 13:44.253
He thinks you're
mentally challenged.

13:44.423 --> 13:46.050
Well...

13:47.026 --> 13:49.119
-...you know.
-What happens when you show up?

13:49.295 --> 13:50.853
He'll see that you're not.

13:51.030 --> 13:53.760
-Not necessarily, because....
-I know, I know.

13:57.403 --> 14:00.463
Cheryl, would you ready
the nitrous oxide, please.

14:09.682 --> 14:11.309
It's good.

14:12.451 --> 14:13.941
Where is Jennifer today?

14:14.620 --> 14:16.781
She's over at Dr. Seisman's office.

14:16.956 --> 14:20.619
Yeah, we find it fun
to swap now and then.

14:22.962 --> 14:27.922
Now, you just take some
deep breaths and try to relax.

14:49.622 --> 14:51.351
Oh, man!

14:52.258 --> 14:54.089
It's George.

14:54.260 --> 14:57.229
Oh, Sports Wholesalers, yeah, yeah.
Thanks for calling me back.

14:57.396 --> 14:59.921
No, I still got the shoes.
Still got shoes, lots of them.

15:00.099 --> 15:02.431
Yeah, this is beautiful athletic gear.

15:03.168 --> 15:06.069
I'm sorry, I gotta call you right back.
Yeah. All right.

15:06.372 --> 15:08.237
-Mr. Wilhelm.
-So, George...

15:08.407 --> 15:10.841
...have you heard anything
about the missing equipment?

15:11.510 --> 15:12.807
No, no. Not a thing.

15:12.978 --> 15:16.971
You know, George, there's nothing
I hate more than a liar.

15:17.149 --> 15:20.448
Well, there's no room for someone
like that in this organization.

15:21.086 --> 15:24.214
-Are you feeling all right, George?
-Yeah, fine.

15:24.390 --> 15:26.187
You look a little warm.

15:26.358 --> 15:27.655
It's the chicken.

15:28.027 --> 15:30.689
You're a terrible liar, George.
Look at you. You're a wreck.

15:30.863 --> 15:33.423
-You're sweating bullets.
-It's the Kung Pao.

15:33.599 --> 15:36.295
George likes his chicken spicy.

16:03.929 --> 16:05.556
Maybe you were still under the gas.

16:05.731 --> 16:08.495
Maybe you were hallucinating
you were coming out of the gas...

16:08.667 --> 16:10.760
-...but still under the gas.
-I don't think so.

16:10.936 --> 16:12.836
I think they were getting dressed.

16:13.005 --> 16:15.565
And not only that, my shirt was out.

16:15.741 --> 16:17.709
-Your shirt was out?
-I think so.

16:17.876 --> 16:22.074
-Well, what kind of shirt was it?
-You know, like a tennis shirt.

16:22.614 --> 16:26.414
-You don't tuck those in.
-Sometimes I tuck, sometimes I don't.

16:26.785 --> 16:30.585
-Well, were you tucked?
-I think I was tucked.

16:30.856 --> 16:33.654
All right, say you were. What do you
think could have happened?

16:33.826 --> 16:37.193
I don't know. But I was spitting out and
rinsing like there was no tomorrow.

16:42.835 --> 16:45.497
Is this guy a dentist or Caligula?

16:47.272 --> 16:50.105
-What are you getting?
-I don't think I'm hungry.

16:50.476 --> 16:53.309
Okay, so you were violated
by two people...

16:53.479 --> 16:56.937
...while you were under the gas.
So what?

16:58.584 --> 17:00.711
You're single.

17:01.720 --> 17:03.881
I'm damaged goods now.

17:04.455 --> 17:06.515
Join the club.

17:06.892 --> 17:08.826
You ever call that guy
from the health club?

17:08.993 --> 17:10.393
Oh, yeah, Jimmy.

17:10.762 --> 17:12.424
Jimmy?

17:13.499 --> 17:15.967
-That's the guy?
-Yeah.

17:16.135 --> 17:18.228
I can't believe you're
going out with him.

17:18.404 --> 17:20.598
-Why?
-I don't know, he's so strange.

17:21.073 --> 17:22.061
How so?

17:22.241 --> 17:24.835
Didn't you notice he refers
to himself in the third person?

17:25.010 --> 17:27.137
"Jimmy can dunk.
Jimmy's new in town.

17:27.311 --> 17:29.405
Jimmy will see you later."

17:32.785 --> 17:34.309
No, wait a minute.
That's not him.

17:34.486 --> 17:36.852
That's the guy who gave me
Jimmy's number.

17:37.022 --> 17:39.252
That's Jimmy.

17:39.625 --> 17:41.525
That's the way he talks.

17:42.728 --> 17:45.424
I'm gonna go see Mel Tormé
with him?

17:45.597 --> 17:47.656
Jimmy's gonna put
the moves on Elaine.

17:50.836 --> 17:53.031
So I have to go see
Steinbrenner later.

17:53.205 --> 17:56.606
Wilhelm told him I was responsible
for stealing all the merchandise.

17:56.775 --> 17:57.901
Why?

17:58.077 --> 18:01.945
Because when he questioned me,
I was sweating from the Kung Pao.

18:02.314 --> 18:04.976
I don't know how you could
eat that spicy chicken.

18:05.150 --> 18:07.778
George likes spicy chicken.

18:08.720 --> 18:10.449
What's that?

18:10.722 --> 18:11.780
I like spicy chicken.

18:11.957 --> 18:15.393
No, no, you said,
"George likes spicy chicken."

18:15.561 --> 18:16.892
-No, I didn't.
-Yes, you did.

18:17.062 --> 18:20.623
-"George likes spicy chicken."
-You're turning into Jimmy.

18:21.166 --> 18:23.157
George is getting upset.

18:25.037 --> 18:27.699
So, what did you want
to see Jimmy about?

18:27.873 --> 18:31.468
Well, Jimmy, about tonight.

18:32.044 --> 18:35.445
There's been a little
misunderstanding.

18:35.614 --> 18:37.343
Jimmy doesn't like
misunderstandings.

18:37.516 --> 18:39.040
Yeah, well, what happened was--

18:39.218 --> 18:42.210
Jimmy and misunderstandings
kind of clash.

18:43.889 --> 18:46.824
You know, I've never heard
anyone talk the way you do.

18:46.992 --> 18:50.428
-It's very unusual.
-Well, Jimmy's very unusual.

18:50.896 --> 18:54.957
Well, anyway, see, when I made
the date, I thought that Jimmy--

18:55.134 --> 18:58.570
Hey, look, Hank's got
a new boyfriend.

18:58.737 --> 19:01.137
Jimmy's not threatened
by Hank's sexuality.

19:01.306 --> 19:02.898
Jimmy's happy for Hank.

19:04.243 --> 19:06.370
Elaine once tried to convert one...

19:06.545 --> 19:08.706
...but Elaine's not gonna go
through that again.

19:11.617 --> 19:14.051
I'm gonna go and try
and find some candy.

19:14.219 --> 19:15.743
-You want some?
-Yeah.

19:15.921 --> 19:17.548
-What kind?
-I don't care.

19:21.527 --> 19:22.892
-Hey, Jimmy.
-Hi, Elaine.

19:23.428 --> 19:26.864
-Elaine got a new dress.
-Jimmy likes it.

19:27.032 --> 19:29.557
There's no candy around here.
Hey, Jimmy.

19:29.735 --> 19:33.330
Well, look who's here.

19:33.505 --> 19:36.133
-That's the guy who sidelined Jimmy.
-What?

19:36.308 --> 19:38.640
That guy took the bread
out of Jimmy's mouth.

19:39.077 --> 19:41.705
Jimmy's out of work
because of you.

19:42.447 --> 19:44.438
-Jimmy wants a piece of Kramer!
-Come on, now.

19:44.616 --> 19:46.311
Get your hands off Jimmy!

19:46.485 --> 19:48.316
Jimmy's gonna get you, Kramer!

19:48.487 --> 19:51.615
Hands off Jimmy!
Don't touch Jimmy!

19:51.790 --> 19:53.314
Let go of Jimmy!

19:53.492 --> 19:55.619
Yeah, l-- Is my lip swollen?

19:57.996 --> 20:00.294
Guy's got a problem.

20:02.968 --> 20:06.699
No, no, I've been living alone
a long time now.

20:08.540 --> 20:11.634
Well, I think that's the tops.

20:20.452 --> 20:22.443
You wanted to see me,
Mr. Steinbrenner?

20:22.621 --> 20:23.952
Yes, George, come in, come in.

20:24.122 --> 20:25.680
I've been your biggest supporter...

20:25.857 --> 20:28.826
...and I was disappointed to hear
you've been pilfering equipment.

20:29.561 --> 20:32.689
George would never do
anything like that.

20:33.298 --> 20:36.995
-No, why would l? I own it.
-Right.

20:37.302 --> 20:39.099
So, what are you saying?

20:39.271 --> 20:42.104
Why would George steal
from the Yankees?

20:42.274 --> 20:44.037
-He wouldn't.
-Of course not.

20:44.209 --> 20:46.109
Exactly.

20:46.979 --> 20:48.947
I don't know what the hell
is going on here.

20:49.114 --> 20:51.241
-Sir?
-Nothing.

20:51.550 --> 20:53.745
Well, I was thinking it's time
for George's lunch.

20:53.919 --> 20:56.820
Yes, it is. All right.
Let's see, what do I have today?

20:56.989 --> 20:59.856
Oh, darn it.
It's ham and cheese again.

21:00.025 --> 21:03.256
And she forgot the fancy mustard.
I told her I like that fancy mustard.

21:03.428 --> 21:06.727
You could put that mustard on a shoe
and it would taste pretty good to me.

21:06.898 --> 21:08.490
She made up for it with a cupcake.

21:08.667 --> 21:11.830
I got a new system of eating these.
I used to peel off the chocolate.

21:12.004 --> 21:14.632
Now I eat the cake first
and save the frosting for the end.

21:14.806 --> 21:16.239
It's almost a dessert dessert.

21:17.509 --> 21:18.737
Ladies and gentlemen...

21:19.578 --> 21:24.777
...I wanna dedicate this song
to a very courageous young man.

23:09.020 --> 23:11.318
Hey, got the new <i>Penthouse</i>.

23:11.490 --> 23:14.118
-Where's my Mr. Goodbar?
-Yeah, here you are.

23:15.527 --> 23:17.154
Oh, here, here. Listen.

23:17.329 --> 23:18.762
"Dear <i>Penthouse</i> :

23:18.930 --> 23:22.297
I'd like to tell you about
an experience I recently had.

23:22.467 --> 23:24.094
As an avid reader,
I've always wondered...

23:24.269 --> 23:26.669
-...if the letters are true.
-lf the letters are true.

23:26.838 --> 23:29.568
I'm a dentist, and one afternoon,
my hygienist and l...

23:29.741 --> 23:33.040
...decided to have a little fun
with one of our patients.

23:33.211 --> 23:37.739
Of course, none of our patients had
any idea exactly what we were up to.

23:37.916 --> 23:42.615
I was still wondering whether or not
the tools I could use...."
