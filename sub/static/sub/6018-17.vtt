00:02.569 --> 00:04.002
I was thinking about hair...

00:05.572 --> 00:07.403
...and that the weird thing about it...

00:07.574 --> 00:10.304
...is that people will touch
other people's hair.

00:10.477 --> 00:13.674
You will actually kiss another
human being right on the head...

00:13.847 --> 00:15.781
...but if one of those hairs...

00:15.949 --> 00:21.285
...should somehow be able to get out
of that skull and go off on its own...

00:21.454 --> 00:26.687
...it is now the vilest, most disgusting
thing that you can encounter.

00:27.560 --> 00:29.027
The same hair.

00:29.195 --> 00:34.064
People freak out,
"There was a hair in the egg salad."

00:38.872 --> 00:42.535
Say it's Saturday night in Spain.
They go out dancing.

00:42.709 --> 00:44.700
Think they do the flamenco?

00:45.278 --> 00:46.540
I would think.

00:46.713 --> 00:48.408
So you could call a woman
for a date...

00:48.581 --> 00:51.072
...ask her if she's free
for dinner and a flamenco.

00:51.785 --> 00:54.652
You don't flamenco on the first date.

00:54.821 --> 00:56.584
I wish the flamenco
was popular here.

00:56.756 --> 01:00.214
-Yeah? Would you do it?
-Yes, I think I would.

01:00.393 --> 01:02.224
Well, I knew you had
an affinity for it...

01:02.395 --> 01:04.955
...because it's the dance
of a very proud people.

01:05.465 --> 01:09.060
Hello. Oh, hi, Nana. What?

01:09.235 --> 01:11.760
Oh, all right.
Okay, don't worry about it.

01:11.938 --> 01:14.964
Okay, I'll see you later.
All right, bye.

01:15.141 --> 01:17.234
-I have to go over my grandmother's.
-What for?

01:17.410 --> 01:19.810
I have to open
a bottle of ketchup for her.

01:21.548 --> 01:24.312
-So, what, no lunch?
-No, we have time.

01:24.818 --> 01:27.412
-How's she doing?
-She's starting to slip a little.

01:27.587 --> 01:30.454
She has trouble distinguishing
between the past and the present.

01:30.723 --> 01:32.782
There's gotta be an easier way
to open ketchup.

01:32.959 --> 01:34.449
They should make it in a tube.

01:34.828 --> 01:36.352
-Like toothpaste?
-Yeah.

01:36.529 --> 01:38.963
-There's a squeeze ketchup.
-I've seen squeeze mustard.

01:39.132 --> 01:42.067
-I've never seen squeeze ketchup.
-lf they make squeeze mustard...

01:42.235 --> 01:44.396
...doesn't it stand to reason
they make squeeze ketchup?

01:44.571 --> 01:47.335
Not necessarily.
Mustard lends itself to the squeeze.

01:47.507 --> 01:49.771
-I don't see the difference.
-There's a difference.

01:49.943 --> 01:51.274
-It's subtle.
-It's subtle?

01:51.444 --> 01:53.639
Hey, isn't Elaine
supposed to meet us?

01:53.813 --> 01:55.804
Yeah, there she is.

01:56.549 --> 01:57.777
What?

01:57.951 --> 01:59.748
She's with her friend Wendy.

01:59.919 --> 02:02.319
Wendy?
Is that the physical therapist?

02:02.489 --> 02:04.787
Yeah. I'm on a kiss-hello
program with her.

02:04.958 --> 02:06.687
-Really?
-Yeah. Every time I see her...

02:06.860 --> 02:09.192
...I gotta kiss hello.
I did it once on her birthday.

02:09.362 --> 02:12.957
Somehow it mushroomed.
Now I dread seeing her because of it.

02:13.133 --> 02:15.863
-Hey.
-I'm down to one kiss hello.

02:16.035 --> 02:19.163
-My aunt Celia.
-That's fortunate. I really admire that.

02:19.339 --> 02:22.638
Really? I never heard you say
you admired me for anything.

02:22.809 --> 02:25.573
No, I told you I admire your hearing.

02:25.979 --> 02:29.005
Oh, don't slough that off.
You have great hearing.

02:29.182 --> 02:31.548
-Hey.
-Hi.

02:32.185 --> 02:34.050
-Did you ever meet George?
-Wendy.

02:34.387 --> 02:36.321
-You're a physical therapist, right?
-Yes.

02:36.489 --> 02:39.151
You know,
I got this little swelling right here.

02:39.325 --> 02:41.486
It's kind of painful.
What do you make of that?

02:41.661 --> 02:43.822
-George--
-Have you tried heat and ice on it?

02:44.197 --> 02:46.722
Oh, that-- That really seems
like a lot of trouble.

02:47.000 --> 02:49.833
You could come by my office later.
I could work on it for you.

02:50.003 --> 02:51.402
Oh, okay.

02:51.571 --> 02:52.799
Let me give you my card.

02:52.972 --> 02:55.338
-Oh, thank you.
-Well, I'll see you guys later.

02:55.508 --> 02:57.635
-Nice meeting you. Bye.
-Bye, Wendy. I'm sorry.

02:57.810 --> 02:59.778
-Bye, Jerry.
-Bye.

03:00.480 --> 03:02.505
-What did you do that for?
-What?

03:02.682 --> 03:04.809
Ask about your arm.

03:06.452 --> 03:08.716
I still don't see why I can't
ask her about my arm.

03:08.888 --> 03:10.185
She's a physical therapist.

03:10.356 --> 03:13.018
She doesn't wanna have to deal
with that outside the office.

03:13.193 --> 03:16.629
-Why not?
-Because it is what she does.

03:16.796 --> 03:18.991
I love these people.
You can't ask them questions.

03:19.165 --> 03:22.396
They're so mentally gifted that we
mustn't disturb the delicate genius...

03:22.569 --> 03:24.503
...unless it's in the confines
of an office.

03:24.671 --> 03:29.199
When huge sums of money are
involved, the genius can be disturbed.

03:29.375 --> 03:31.741
George, you got a little
something right here.

03:31.911 --> 03:34.903
-People think they're so important.
-I'm going on record right now.

03:35.081 --> 03:38.573
That was my last kiss hello. I am
getting off the kiss program with her.

03:38.751 --> 03:41.117
-Why?
-Well, you know, frankly...

03:41.287 --> 03:44.882
...outside of a sexual relationship,
I don't see the point to it.

03:45.058 --> 03:48.892
I'm not thrilled with the handshaking
either, but one step at a time.

03:49.429 --> 03:52.057
-What are you getting?
-And what's with that hairdo?

03:52.232 --> 03:55.463
Oh, yeah. I know.
It's not very flattering.

03:55.635 --> 03:59.071
I mean, she looks like something
out of an old high school yearbook.

03:59.239 --> 04:00.672
You should say something to her.

04:00.840 --> 04:03.035
Oh, I could never say anything
to her about that.

04:03.209 --> 04:06.235
Yeah, Kramer's the only person
who could say something like that.

04:06.412 --> 04:09.245
-Yeah.
-Well, just tell Kramer to tell her.

04:09.415 --> 04:12.213
No. If you tell him to do it,
he'll never do it.

04:12.385 --> 04:15.718
What you have to do is introduce him,
and then he'll just come out with it.

04:15.888 --> 04:17.913
Yes. Yes, you're right. That's right.

04:18.091 --> 04:20.524
I'll bring her over to meet Kramer.

04:20.692 --> 04:23.491
-Hi.
-Hey. Hello, boys and girls.

04:23.663 --> 04:27.190
Yeah. Hey, listen.
I need a picture of you, buddy.

04:27.367 --> 04:29.927
-What for?
-I'm putting everybody's picture up...

04:30.103 --> 04:32.765
-...in the lobby of our building.
-Why?

04:32.939 --> 04:37.035
Everyone will know everybody's name.
People are gonna be a lot friendlier.

04:37.210 --> 04:39.701
I don't want my picture
plastered up in the lobby.

04:39.879 --> 04:43.474
Imagine walking by someone on
the floor and you say, "Hey, Carl"...

04:43.650 --> 04:48.417
...and he says, "Hey, Jerry." That's
the kind of society I wanna live in.

04:48.921 --> 04:52.220
Kramer, I don't wanna stop and talk
every time I go in the building.

04:52.392 --> 04:54.189
I just wanna nod
and be on my way.

04:54.360 --> 04:56.385
You know,
your eyeliner's smudged a little.

04:57.130 --> 04:59.291
Why do you wear
so much eye makeup?

05:00.233 --> 05:04.863
Yeah. This is gonna work out
just fine.

05:05.038 --> 05:07.302
Ma, again with the ketchup?

05:07.473 --> 05:11.136
Don't they have them in
the plastic squeeze containers?

05:15.815 --> 05:18.215
Jerry. Hello.

05:18.384 --> 05:21.148
Hello, Uncle Leo.

05:21.321 --> 05:24.017
-What are you doing here?
-Nana called me to open the bottle.

05:24.190 --> 05:25.817
Yeah, me too.

05:25.992 --> 05:29.223
-Hello, Jerry.
-Hi, Nana.

05:29.862 --> 05:33.059
-Aren't you gonna kiss her hello?
-Yes, yes, of course.

05:33.232 --> 05:34.927
Well, here's the bottle.

05:35.101 --> 05:36.329
-I'll do it.
-I got it.

05:36.502 --> 05:37.730
-Give it to me.
-Stop it.

05:37.904 --> 05:41.032
-Jerry, would you give me the bottle?
-Uncle Leo.

05:42.442 --> 05:43.807
All right. Take it.

05:43.976 --> 05:46.069
You should let Buddy open it.

05:46.245 --> 05:50.409
Buddy? He lived next door to us
45 years ago.

05:51.084 --> 05:55.748
-Leo, did you give Helen the $50?
-What $50?

05:55.922 --> 05:59.449
Your father won $1000
at the track last week...

05:59.625 --> 06:01.217
...and he gave you 100...

06:01.394 --> 06:04.659
...and you were supposed to give
$50 to your sister.

06:04.831 --> 06:09.359
Ma, Dad died in 1962.

06:10.403 --> 06:13.770
Believe me,
I don't owe your mother $50.

06:21.447 --> 06:22.880
I'm not getting any hot water.

06:23.049 --> 06:25.950
I know there's nothing worse
than when your shower's not working.

06:26.119 --> 06:28.019
-I'm gonna take care of it.
-Thanks, Julio.

06:28.187 --> 06:29.620
All right.

06:34.761 --> 06:37.696
-Oh, hey.
-Hey, hey. Hello.

06:39.565 --> 06:42.056
-What's going on here?
-Nothing, nothing.

06:42.235 --> 06:45.261
-Well, then what are you doing?
-I need a pen.

06:45.438 --> 06:48.930
-What for?
-Well, I'm making out my will.

06:49.509 --> 06:51.739
Oh, I got a big slice of dough
for you, buddy...

06:51.911 --> 06:53.742
...and you too.
I haven't forgotten you.

06:53.913 --> 06:55.505
You're looking for a picture of me?

06:55.681 --> 06:57.410
You got that straight.

06:58.050 --> 06:59.278
I told you, forget it.

06:59.452 --> 07:01.920
Oh, come on, Jerry.
If everybody knew everybody...

07:02.088 --> 07:04.579
...we wouldn't have the problems
we have in the world.

07:04.757 --> 07:06.918
You don't rob somebody
if you know their name.

07:07.093 --> 07:08.890
You're robbing me.

07:10.797 --> 07:14.824
I'm gonna get your picture, and you're
gonna participate in my program.

07:15.134 --> 07:16.931
-Are you going home?
-Yeah.

07:17.103 --> 07:20.266
Can you come back
in about five minutes?

07:20.440 --> 07:21.737
Why?

07:21.908 --> 07:25.571
No reason.
Just wanna see you again.

07:27.000 --> 07:33.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

07:37.190 --> 07:39.886
-You sure Wendy's coming?
-Yeah, she'll be here any second.

07:40.059 --> 07:43.290
This will be an interesting experiment
to see if Kramer says something.

07:43.463 --> 07:46.489
-You wanna go through with this?
-Listen, Jerry, she never dates...

07:46.666 --> 07:49.226
...and I know it's because of her hair.

07:53.105 --> 07:55.573
Hello. Oh, hi, Mom.

07:55.741 --> 07:59.837
Yeah, I was at Nana's yesterday. I
had to help her open a ketchup bottle.

08:00.346 --> 08:02.041
Hey, Mom, let me ask you a question.

08:02.215 --> 08:04.877
Do you remember
when you were a kid...

08:05.351 --> 08:09.151
...your father winning,
like, $1000 at the track?

08:09.422 --> 08:10.821
Really?

08:10.990 --> 08:12.958
Did you know
he gave Uncle Leo $100...

08:13.125 --> 08:15.616
...and he was supposed
to give you 50?

08:15.862 --> 08:18.831
How do I know? Because Nana
doesn't know what year it is...

08:18.998 --> 08:21.330
...and she thinks
this just happened.

08:22.134 --> 08:24.125
Well, I think you should.

08:24.303 --> 08:25.998
Okay. Bye.

08:27.073 --> 08:31.032
Do you know what the interest
on that $50 comes to over 53 years?

08:31.210 --> 08:32.541
Oh, Morty, please.

08:32.712 --> 08:35.806
$663.45...

08:35.982 --> 08:38.917
...and that's figuring conservatively
at 5 percent interest...

08:39.085 --> 08:42.145
...over 53 years
compounded quarterly.

08:42.321 --> 08:46.018
-Or if you put it into a 10-year T-bill--
-Morty, will you stop it?

08:46.192 --> 08:48.717
Well, he's not
getting away with this.

08:53.332 --> 08:54.629
-Yeah?
-<i>It's Wendy.</i>

08:54.800 --> 08:56.392
Come on up.

08:57.703 --> 09:00.536
-This is it. Should I go get Kramer?
-No, no. He'll come in.

09:00.706 --> 09:03.869
This is gonna be my first
opportunity to not kiss her hello.

09:04.043 --> 09:07.945
What is the big deal about putting
your lips on somebody's face?

09:08.114 --> 09:11.049
It's the obligation. You know,
as soon as this person comes in...

09:11.217 --> 09:13.117
...you know you have to do this.

09:13.286 --> 09:17.814
I mean, if you could, say, touch
a breast as part of the kiss hello...

09:18.758 --> 09:21.750
...then I think I could see
the value in it a little better.

09:21.928 --> 09:24.590
How about an intercourse hello?
How would that be?

09:25.765 --> 09:27.665
Elaine, now you're being ridiculous.

09:29.435 --> 09:31.767
-That's her. That's her.
-Wait, wait.

09:31.938 --> 09:34.372
-What?
-Okay, go, go, go.

09:36.075 --> 09:37.804
-Hi, Wendy.
-Hi, Elaine.

09:37.977 --> 09:39.740
-Hi, Wendy.
-Oh, hi, Jerry.

09:39.912 --> 09:42.210
-Would you like something to drink?
-Sure.

09:42.748 --> 09:44.511
There you go.

09:49.121 --> 09:52.579
Oh, look at that.
I'm almost out of Klondike bars.

09:54.927 --> 09:56.258
So how's everything going?

09:56.429 --> 09:59.193
Oh, okay. Your friend George
came by the office the other day.

09:59.365 --> 10:01.128
And then yesterday,
he canceled on me.

10:01.300 --> 10:03.666
Yeah, he had to take
his mother to the chiropodist.

10:04.604 --> 10:07.368
Oh, did you hear that?
That must be Kramer.

10:07.540 --> 10:09.474
Hey, Jerry.

10:13.245 --> 10:15.805
-Come on. That's not fair.
-I told you I was gonna get it.

10:15.982 --> 10:19.748
-No, come on. Give me the picture.
-No, no, no.

10:19.952 --> 10:22.386
All right, fine. Put my picture up.
What do I care?

10:23.489 --> 10:26.390
Kramer, Kramer, I'd like you
to meet my friend Wendy.

10:26.559 --> 10:28.049
-Oh, hello.
-Hi.

10:34.900 --> 10:36.993
You know, I really like that hairdo.

10:39.438 --> 10:42.339
Thank you. I actually was thinking
it might be time for a change.

10:42.508 --> 10:45.944
-Oh, you were?
-No, no. You don't wanna do that.

10:46.345 --> 10:48.279
-Nobody wears it like that.
-No, Kramer...

10:48.447 --> 10:50.312
-...if she wants to change her hair--
-No.

10:50.483 --> 10:52.951
You'd be a damn fool to change it.

10:53.119 --> 10:55.587
-It's very becoming.
-Oh, well.

11:05.364 --> 11:07.730
So who's that friend of yours,
that guy who came in?

11:07.900 --> 11:11.563
-Oh, Kramer.
-Yeah. Does he have a girlfriend?

11:11.837 --> 11:13.771
You wanna go out with him?

11:13.939 --> 11:15.600
Well, why not?

11:15.975 --> 11:18.341
Well, it's just that--
That l--

11:18.511 --> 11:21.173
What, is there anything
wrong with him?

11:25.051 --> 11:26.643
Elaine?

11:27.520 --> 11:29.886
No, I'm just thinking
about the question.

11:34.026 --> 11:37.189
You know, my arm feels a lot better.
That Wendy really knows her stuff.

11:37.596 --> 11:39.393
-She is super.
-Yeah.

11:39.565 --> 11:40.827
Same time tomorrow?

11:41.167 --> 11:44.603
Yeah, same time. There you go.

11:45.705 --> 11:48.936
Oh, you owe 150.

11:49.508 --> 11:51.908
-What for?
-Well, you canceled on Tuesday...

11:52.078 --> 11:54.911
...and our policy is 24 hours' notice...

11:55.081 --> 11:57.549
...for all cancellations.

11:58.384 --> 12:01.876
Well, I couldn't come. I had to drive
my mother to the chiropodist.

12:02.054 --> 12:05.421
-What's the problem?
-I'm being charged for Tuesday.

12:05.591 --> 12:07.491
I had to take my mother
to the chiropodist.

12:07.660 --> 12:09.218
Well, I'm sorry. That's our policy.

12:11.063 --> 12:15.625
Oh, you have a policy.
The delicate genius has a policy.

12:17.036 --> 12:19.004
So will you be here tomorrow?

12:19.638 --> 12:23.938
Well, it's less than 24 hours,
so I guess I have to.

12:28.447 --> 12:31.348
Hey. So, what do you think?
You like it?

12:31.517 --> 12:35.419
Oh, my God. Look at that picture.
That's terrible.

12:35.588 --> 12:37.078
You can't put that picture up.

12:37.256 --> 12:39.224
Well, it's not a beauty contest.

12:39.391 --> 12:42.189
It's just a way for people
to get to know one another.

12:42.361 --> 12:44.158
-Hi, Cosmo.
-Hey...

12:44.330 --> 12:45.922
...Steve.

12:46.966 --> 12:48.331
Now, you see?

12:48.934 --> 12:51.425
Hey, Kramer. My friend Wendy
wants to go out with you.

12:51.604 --> 12:54.072
Well, how do you do?

12:55.307 --> 12:58.276
Hello, Jerry.

12:58.444 --> 13:00.503
Oh, hello...

13:02.581 --> 13:04.173
...Mary.

13:04.350 --> 13:08.343
I've seen you so many times, and
now we can finally talk to each other.

13:08.521 --> 13:10.989
See, what was I telling you?
Isn't this nice?

13:11.157 --> 13:13.785
Jerry, you know, could you
help me with a package?

13:13.959 --> 13:16.792
-Oh, sure. Yeah.
-Thank you.

13:19.298 --> 13:21.823
Oh, no.

13:23.102 --> 13:26.731
You see, that's just what I need,
more kissing.

13:29.241 --> 13:30.731
What is so funny?

13:30.910 --> 13:32.172
Nothing. Nothing.

13:35.881 --> 13:38.179
Hello. Oh, hi, Ma.

13:38.350 --> 13:39.578
What?

13:39.752 --> 13:42.118
Oh, Ma, he didn't?

13:42.288 --> 13:44.188
He couldn't.

13:44.356 --> 13:46.017
All right, I will.

13:46.192 --> 13:48.023
Okay, bye.

13:48.627 --> 13:50.993
Uncle Leo put Nana in a home.

13:51.463 --> 13:53.863
-Why?
-I don't know.

13:54.033 --> 13:56.433
Maybe to keep her quiet.

14:02.274 --> 14:04.105
Hi, Jerry.

14:05.244 --> 14:06.905
-Hi, Joan.
-How you doing?

14:07.079 --> 14:09.274
-Pretty good.
-Just pretty good? Not great?

14:09.448 --> 14:10.847
Okay, great.

14:11.016 --> 14:12.847
-Are you happy?
-Oh, I'm delighted.

14:13.018 --> 14:15.851
-Okay. Have a nice day.
-You too.

14:16.188 --> 14:19.817
-Hi, Jerry.
-Hi, Louise.

14:24.964 --> 14:26.363
Hey.

14:26.799 --> 14:28.926
Oh, well, thank you very much.

14:29.201 --> 14:31.465
-For what?
-For putting my picture up on that wall.

14:31.637 --> 14:34.401
I'm like Richard Dawson
down there now.

14:35.407 --> 14:39.400
Every person I see engages me in this
long, boring, tedious conversation.

14:39.578 --> 14:42.877
-I can't even get out of the building.
-You should be thanking me...

14:43.048 --> 14:46.313
...for liberating you from your world
of loneliness and isolation.

14:46.485 --> 14:49.477
-Now you're part of a family.
-Family?

14:49.655 --> 14:51.520
-Yeah.
-You think I want another family?

14:51.690 --> 14:54.090
My father's demanding
my uncle pay interest...

14:54.260 --> 14:57.320
...on $50 he was supposed
to give my mother in 1941...

14:57.496 --> 15:01.193
...and my uncle put my Nana
in a home to try and shut her up.

15:01.367 --> 15:04.097
Another thing, Cosmo, Kramer,
whatever you wanna be called...

15:04.270 --> 15:06.738
...the kissing thing is over.
There's no more kissing...

15:06.906 --> 15:09.170
...and I don't care
what the consequences are.

15:32.197 --> 15:36.361
Oh, hi, Mr. Costanza. We were
trying to get in touch with you.

15:36.535 --> 15:39.629
Wendy can't make her appointment.

15:42.041 --> 15:44.635
-What do you mean?
-She had some personal affairs...

15:44.810 --> 15:46.038
...she had to attend to.

15:46.211 --> 15:48.543
I left a message on your machine.
You didn't get it?

15:48.914 --> 15:51.712
-When did you leave the message?
-A few hours ago.

15:52.384 --> 15:57.378
Oh, I'm sorry. I require 24 hours'
notice for a cancellation.

15:57.556 --> 16:00.787
Now, as I see it,
you owe me $75.

16:00.960 --> 16:05.124
-Look, Mr. Costanza--
-Will that be cash or check?

16:08.534 --> 16:10.399
I am really glad I took the day off.

16:10.569 --> 16:12.730
Oh, yeah.
There's nothing better than skiing.

16:12.905 --> 16:15.965
Yeah. God, I hope my clients
weren't too upset.

16:16.575 --> 16:18.372
The hell with them.

16:21.814 --> 16:23.406
What are you stopping here for?

16:23.582 --> 16:25.379
I'm dropping you off.

16:25.551 --> 16:28.577
-Oh, no. I'm three more blocks.
-lf I take you right to your door...

16:28.754 --> 16:31.917
...I have to go all the way around
Central Park West, back to Columbus.

16:32.091 --> 16:34.321
You know, it's all one-way.

16:34.493 --> 16:36.154
Yeah, but it's only three blocks.

16:36.328 --> 16:38.956
Right. It's only three blocks.

16:41.300 --> 16:42.460
All right. Well.

16:46.005 --> 16:47.472
I got it.

16:54.947 --> 16:57.973
She'd driven me 120 miles,
then all of a sudden...

16:58.150 --> 17:02.177
...three blocks from my door,
she decides this trip is over.

17:02.354 --> 17:04.948
-Isn't that strange?
-Yes, it's very strange, very strange.

17:05.124 --> 17:06.853
I've never heard of anything like this.

17:07.026 --> 17:10.791
It's as if I was hitchhiking and she
said, "This is as far as I can take you."

17:10.963 --> 17:14.592
If you were, you'd never get in a car
with someone with a hairdo like that.

17:14.767 --> 17:17.201
I had to carry my skis
and my boots and my poles.

17:17.368 --> 17:20.861
-I pinched a nerve in my shoulder.
-You should have her work on it.

17:21.040 --> 17:22.769
Yeah. All right. I gotta go.

17:25.377 --> 17:27.140
-Hi, Jerry.
-Hi, Mary.

17:27.311 --> 17:30.247
Listen, I've decided
I can't kiss hello anymore.

17:30.416 --> 17:34.750
I'm sorry. It's nothing personal. It
makes me uncomfortable. I'm sorry.

17:35.788 --> 17:38.086
-Hi, Jerry.
-Hi, Louise. I was just telling Mary...

17:38.257 --> 17:41.090
...how I'm not gonna do the
kiss-hello thing anymore. I'm sorry.

17:41.260 --> 17:43.091
I just can't do it.
It's nothing personal.

17:43.262 --> 17:47.926
It's just that I'm not really able to do it.
Thank you for your cooperation.

17:48.467 --> 17:49.695
-Hello.
-<i>Jerry?</i>

17:49.868 --> 17:52.462
Hi, Mom. What's happening
with Uncle Leo? Is he paying you?

17:52.638 --> 17:54.970
Well, he said no.
He says we have no proof.

17:55.140 --> 17:57.233
No proof? We'll get him.

17:57.409 --> 18:00.003
He's a crook.
Sooner or later he'll slip up.

18:00.179 --> 18:03.512
Anyway, I want you to go
check on Nana at the home.

18:03.682 --> 18:05.274
-Okay, I will.
-Do you realize...

18:05.451 --> 18:10.218
...an above average performing
growth mutual fund for 53 years--

18:11.256 --> 18:14.714
-What's up?
-I gotta go visit my nana in the home.

18:19.631 --> 18:22.532
Hey, Kramer. Look at this.
Look at my picture.

18:23.435 --> 18:25.027
I've been defaced.

18:26.605 --> 18:28.971
Well, don't you worry, buddy.
I made double prints.

18:29.141 --> 18:31.701
-Hey. Hi, Cosmo.
-Oh, hey. Jack. How you doing?

18:31.877 --> 18:33.572
Hi, Jack.

18:37.149 --> 18:39.947
I was wondering, could you get
to that shower today, you think?

18:40.119 --> 18:43.520
Oh, I see. When you need something
done, then you're friendly to people.

18:43.689 --> 18:46.214
-No, no. That's not true.
-Well, I think it is.

18:46.391 --> 18:49.519
It's a big building, Seinfeld.
Maybe I'll get to it someday...

18:49.695 --> 18:52.960
...after I take care of the people
that are civil to each other.

18:56.401 --> 18:58.494
Yeah, she's upstairs playing cards.

18:58.670 --> 19:01.332
She really doesn't belong here.
My uncle put her here...

19:01.507 --> 19:04.237
...because he's trying to prove
he doesn't owe my mother $50.

19:04.676 --> 19:07.042
Well, she seems very happy.

19:07.212 --> 19:09.703
She met an old friend
who used to live next door to her.

19:10.649 --> 19:13.049
-Buddy?
-Yes, that's his name.

19:13.218 --> 19:15.118
He's right over there.

19:18.290 --> 19:20.588
I'm sorry. I don't owe you anything.

19:20.759 --> 19:22.693
I had some personal business
that day.

19:23.095 --> 19:26.258
Oh, I see. So your time is more
valuable than mine. Is that it?

19:26.431 --> 19:28.092
You're a delicate genius.

19:28.467 --> 19:29.991
A delicate genius?

19:30.602 --> 19:32.092
-Elaine.
-George.

19:33.906 --> 19:35.703
Good luck.

19:36.408 --> 19:38.467
-What's going on?
-Wendy...

19:38.644 --> 19:41.909
...I injured my shoulder Wednesday
when you dropped me off...

19:42.080 --> 19:45.948
...and I had to carry my skis and my
boots and my poles all the way home.

19:46.118 --> 19:48.177
I'm having trouble lifting my arm.

19:48.353 --> 19:50.253
You think you could
give me some treatment?

19:50.422 --> 19:53.949
Oh, sure.
You have insurance, right?

19:54.393 --> 19:57.385
Insurance? You're charging me?

19:57.563 --> 19:59.258
Wednesday?

19:59.431 --> 20:02.400
That's your personal business?
Skiing?

20:02.568 --> 20:05.628
Sure. Let people suffer while
you're shooshing all over a mountain.

20:05.804 --> 20:10.468
-How did you hear that?
-I hear everything.

20:10.909 --> 20:13.844
All right, why don't you two just
take your business elsewhere.

20:14.780 --> 20:16.771
That is a good idea.

20:16.949 --> 20:19.543
-Come on, George.
-Yeah. Let's go.

20:20.252 --> 20:26.020
And you know, you might wanna
do something about that hair.

20:27.292 --> 20:28.782
Why? What's wrong with my hair?

20:28.961 --> 20:33.364
I think it's a little
old-fashioned, don't you?

20:33.532 --> 20:36.501
-Tell her.
-She's right.

20:37.502 --> 20:39.026
So you were with him
at the track?

20:39.204 --> 20:43.664
Oh, yeah. He won $1000.
His son was there too.

20:43.842 --> 20:46.538
-Leo?
-Yeah, that's it. Leo.

20:46.712 --> 20:49.909
Oh, what an obnoxious little kid.

20:50.082 --> 20:53.142
He used to steal my soda bottles
and cash them in for the deposit.

20:53.852 --> 20:55.080
Is that so?

20:55.320 --> 20:58.255
After your grandfather hit
the daily double, he gave him $100...

20:58.423 --> 21:00.288
...and told him to give $50
to his sister.

21:00.459 --> 21:01.858
His sister?

21:02.027 --> 21:04.996
Well, I said he should give it to me
for all the bottles he took.

21:05.163 --> 21:08.030
Well, that's very interesting.

21:08.400 --> 21:09.833
Uncle Leo...

21:10.002 --> 21:13.438
...I just met an old acquaintance
of yours. You remember Buddy.

21:13.605 --> 21:17.939
He just told me quite a story about
you and Grandpa at the track.

21:18.543 --> 21:21.171
-Wait a second.
-You're busted.

21:24.383 --> 21:26.248
Hey, Steve. How you doing?

21:27.886 --> 21:29.979
Hey, Jeff. What's happening?

21:31.490 --> 21:33.822
Mary. Oh, Mary.

21:33.992 --> 21:36.552
Give us a kiss. Don't be like that.
I made a mistake.

21:36.728 --> 21:40.061
Look, why don't you do everybody a
favor and just get out of this building.

21:40.232 --> 21:42.666
Nobody wants you here. Nobody!

21:42.934 --> 21:45.368
-Hi, Mary.
-Oh, hi, Jeff. How are you?

21:45.537 --> 21:47.266
Hi, Steve. How are you?

21:47.439 --> 21:49.498
-Hey, let's go get some coffee.
-Great idea.

21:49.675 --> 21:51.973
I gotta go down to the corner, but--

21:55.914 --> 21:57.939
Oh, Paul, could you hold that door?

22:11.897 --> 22:13.421
-Hi.
-Hey, could I use your shower?

22:13.598 --> 22:15.293
What, again?
You took one this morning.

22:15.467 --> 22:16.957
I got a date. Come on. Please.

22:17.135 --> 22:19.330
I know, but, you know,
I got a little problem.

22:19.504 --> 22:22.405
-Wendy here?
-No, no. She changed her hairstyle.

22:22.574 --> 22:24.701
It's terrible. No, we're done.

22:24.876 --> 22:26.901
-I'll go get some more beer.
-Oh, yeah. Great.

22:27.079 --> 22:29.604
And get some of those
blue corn chips.

22:29.781 --> 22:31.271
-Hey.
-Hi, Cosmo.

22:31.450 --> 22:34.044
Hi. I like that.

22:34.219 --> 22:35.948
-Who was that?
-That was Stephanie, 2G.

22:36.121 --> 22:37.452
Oh, man.

22:37.622 --> 22:40.614
-You got quite a few people in here.
-Well, I'd invite you in...

22:40.792 --> 22:42.623
...but, you know.

22:42.794 --> 22:45.024
Oh, I understand.
