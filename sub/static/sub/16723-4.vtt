00:20.606 --> 00:22.640
All right!
My Bobby's going off to college.

00:22.641 --> 00:24.642
I'm not going off
to college, Lin.

00:24.643 --> 00:26.878
You don't have the grades!
I'm-I'm just going

00:26.879 --> 00:28.446
to the college
to fill in for Pepe,

00:28.447 --> 00:30.381
cooking at the fraternity
house for a week.

00:30.382 --> 00:32.350
Aw, you're gonna have
so much fun.

00:32.351 --> 00:34.318
Yeah, I don't really see what's
fun about being ordered around

00:34.319 --> 00:36.153
by a bunch of frat boys.

00:36.188 --> 00:37.154
I can explain it.

00:37.155 --> 00:38.389
That's okay, Tina.

00:38.390 --> 00:39.523
All I know is
we need the cash.

00:39.524 --> 00:40.725
So I'm doing it.

00:40.726 --> 00:42.026
Well, you're gonna
miss me hosting

00:42.027 --> 00:44.128
one of Gretchen's
LadyGood parties.

00:44.129 --> 00:45.196
What are "lady goods"?

00:45.197 --> 00:46.297
I don't know.
Makeup?

00:46.331 --> 00:47.698
Tampons and
pony saddles?

00:47.699 --> 00:48.866
Breast organizers?

00:48.901 --> 00:50.368
Okay, well, guess I'd better

00:50.369 --> 00:53.170
go feed Chad and Trip
and Chip and Skip

00:53.171 --> 00:55.039
and all the other rich kids.

00:55.040 --> 00:56.741
You say that
like we're not rich.

00:56.742 --> 00:57.909
(bells jingle)
Wait, Dad.

00:57.910 --> 00:59.176
Are we not rich?

00:59.177 --> 01:00.311
(knocking)

01:00.312 --> 01:01.846
Hi.

01:01.847 --> 01:04.248
I'm the cook.
I'm filling in for Pepe?

01:04.248 --> 01:06.050
Uh, looks
like you guys got TP'd.

01:06.084 --> 01:07.752
Yeah, the Alpha House
likes to prank us.

01:07.753 --> 01:09.086
Joke's on them, though.

01:09.087 --> 01:11.255
Free toilet paper for us!
Oh, yeah.

01:11.256 --> 01:12.657
Tough to roll it
back up, though.

01:12.658 --> 01:13.658
I'm the Beta president.

01:13.659 --> 01:14.692
They call me Pud.

01:14.726 --> 01:17.194
Oh, okay, Pud. I'm Bob.

01:17.195 --> 01:20.031
That's Hefty Jeff... he's
the fraternity historian.

01:20.032 --> 01:21.532
Oh, uh, that's a thing?

01:21.533 --> 01:24.101
Ask me anything
about the history of this frat.

01:24.102 --> 01:26.137
Uh, okay.
When was it founded?

01:26.171 --> 01:28.339
Crap. Ask me something else.

01:28.340 --> 01:29.674
I'm Turd.
Put her there.

01:29.675 --> 01:30.942
Hey, Turd.

01:30.943 --> 01:32.777
So Turd, Pud,
um, Hefty Jeff.

01:32.778 --> 01:34.078
This is, uh...

01:34.112 --> 01:36.414
a nice place you got here.
Thank you.

01:36.448 --> 01:38.282
I mean, the sofa is
upside down, but...

01:38.283 --> 01:39.283
That's for hiding.

01:39.284 --> 01:40.551
And forts!
Yeah.

01:40.585 --> 01:42.119
Okay. So, I'm guessing

01:42.120 --> 01:43.554
this isn't
the top fraternity on campus.

01:43.555 --> 01:44.855
Oh, no.

01:44.856 --> 01:47.425
Our motto is
"If you rushed us,

01:47.426 --> 01:48.693
you'd be pledged by now."

01:48.694 --> 01:49.894
Hey, worked on me.

01:49.895 --> 01:50.962
We haze with hugs.

01:50.963 --> 01:52.029
Some good huggers
in this group.

01:52.030 --> 01:53.698
Girls never come here.

01:53.732 --> 01:55.900
GRETCHEN:
<i>How we doing, ladies?</i>

01:55.934 --> 01:57.702
Let's give it up for Linda
for hosting

01:57.703 --> 01:59.437
tonight's LadyGoods party!

01:59.438 --> 02:02.273
(cheering) (chuckles) Stop it.

02:02.274 --> 02:06.077
Now that everyone's hammered,
let's look at the product line.

02:06.111 --> 02:08.079
Do you think it's appropriate
to have the children here?

02:08.080 --> 02:09.413
Why wouldn't it
be appropriate?

02:09.413 --> 02:11.415
Our money's as green
as yours, toots!

02:11.450 --> 02:14.719
Our first LadyGood
is called the Joie de Vibe,

02:14.720 --> 02:17.455
which we all know
is French for "fun."

02:17.456 --> 02:19.824
(imitates vibrating)
(chuckles nervously)

02:19.825 --> 02:22.326
Ha, ho! I don't know
what that thing is,

02:22.327 --> 02:24.428
but the look on Mom's face
is hilarious!

02:24.429 --> 02:25.629
I'll buy it!

02:25.664 --> 02:27.665
Okay, kids. Come on.
Go to your room now.

02:27.666 --> 02:29.667
Yeah, go to your room, guys.
You, too, missy.

02:29.668 --> 02:31.135
What? Come on. Out now. Oh, man!

02:31.136 --> 02:33.004
Grown-up stuff is going on! Ah...

02:33.005 --> 02:34.739
Okay. I love it!
GENE: I want a magic

02:34.773 --> 02:36.974
vibrating club just
like any other boy!

02:36.975 --> 02:38.943
LINDA: Yeah. All right.
LOUISE: Yeah!

02:38.977 --> 02:40.494
(sizzling)

02:40.512 --> 02:42.513
Bob, this burger
is superb.

02:42.514 --> 02:44.415
What'd you put
in there? Spices?

02:44.416 --> 02:46.817
Uh, a few.
You deserve a beer.

02:46.818 --> 02:48.753
Follow me
to the Fellowship Room.

02:48.754 --> 02:50.154
♪ Fellowship Room!

02:50.155 --> 02:51.622
BOTH:
Fellowship Room!

02:51.623 --> 02:54.625
So... fellowship basically
means drinking.

02:54.626 --> 02:56.027
And drinking
games.

02:56.028 --> 02:57.528
Like Beer Beer Goose.

02:57.529 --> 02:59.296
What's the "Slowhand
Crooner Corner"?

02:59.297 --> 03:00.331
HEFTY JEFF:
Oof,

03:00.332 --> 03:02.033
Slowhand.
Yeah, seriously.

03:02.034 --> 03:05.302
Someone's got to tell him he
graduated a million years ago.

03:05.303 --> 03:07.304
Now, now, Hefty
Jeff, Turd.

03:07.305 --> 03:09.707
Slowhand is a very
generous Beta alum.

03:09.708 --> 03:12.043
He buys us stuff like
that karaoke machine.

03:12.044 --> 03:13.310
Uh, and what's that?

03:13.311 --> 03:15.479
Beta! Beta! Beta!

03:15.480 --> 03:17.148
That's Beta.
Yeah, I got that.

03:17.149 --> 03:19.817
Beta was the house
iguana from '67 to '86.

03:19.818 --> 03:21.986
Only a true brother
may drink from him.

03:21.987 --> 03:23.187
You drink from him?

03:23.221 --> 03:24.855
I ate Indian food
out of him once.

03:24.856 --> 03:26.557
You're not supposed to.
(window slides open)

03:26.558 --> 03:28.559
We're out upstairs.

03:28.560 --> 03:30.327
Oh, hey, Bob.
Did you drive here?

03:30.328 --> 03:31.729
Uh, yeah. Why?

03:31.730 --> 03:33.831
Maybe it's time to
"go to the library."

03:33.832 --> 03:35.499
Tonight?
We're supposed to wait.

03:35.500 --> 03:38.169
Bob can drive. And we're
the perfect level of drunk.

03:38.170 --> 03:41.172
To go to the library? Yeah.
Could you give us a ride to campus?

03:41.173 --> 03:43.140
I can't drive at night
'cause I don't have a car.

03:43.141 --> 03:44.375
Okay.

03:44.376 --> 03:46.177
Moving on, this one is called

03:46.178 --> 03:48.012
Here Comes the Sun.
It's solar-powered

03:48.013 --> 03:49.980
so you leave it on
your porch all day.

03:49.981 --> 03:53.050
Any takers? No?

03:53.085 --> 03:54.351
Okay.

03:54.352 --> 03:55.853
Linda. Linda.
What, what, what?

03:55.854 --> 03:57.755
(quietly): I'm dying here.
This crowd is all

03:57.756 --> 04:00.424
married, boring people who suck.
You got to help me.

04:00.425 --> 04:03.027
What? No. I can't sell anything. I can't s...
You'll be fine, you'll be fine.

04:03.061 --> 04:05.696
Linda swears by this thing,
don't you, Linda?

04:05.697 --> 04:08.866
You know, because of
your problems with your husband?

04:08.900 --> 04:11.001
Yeah! Uh, Bob's got
a condition

04:11.002 --> 04:12.970
that makes him,
uh, sex bad.

04:13.004 --> 04:15.005
My husband's
got that.

04:15.006 --> 04:17.440
It's called being
married for 20 years.

04:17.442 --> 04:18.440
(laughter)

04:18.442 --> 04:20.878
Being married
for 20 years!

04:20.879 --> 04:22.446
She says being married!

04:22.447 --> 04:24.014
(chuckles)
Ah...

04:24.015 --> 04:26.550
I'll take the one with
the hand crank, for camping.

04:26.585 --> 04:29.553
(laughter)
Okay! Who wants more wine?

04:29.588 --> 04:32.089
So, where's the library?
It's just up ahead.

04:32.090 --> 04:34.291
(moans)
I'm really nervous.

04:34.292 --> 04:37.094
The library must be different
than how I'm imagining it.

04:37.129 --> 04:38.929
PUD:
<i>Stop here.</i>

04:38.964 --> 04:41.132
Okay, uh, this isn't
the library. At all.

04:41.133 --> 04:42.733
Hey, would you mind
waiting here?

04:42.734 --> 04:44.034
And keep
the engine running.

04:44.069 --> 04:45.703
What are they doing
with that fish

04:45.704 --> 04:47.404
and that air
conditioner?

04:47.405 --> 04:49.406
Oh. They're putting the fish
in the air conditioner.

04:49.407 --> 04:51.208
That's a good prank. Kind of.

04:51.209 --> 04:53.010
No, it's not.
(others chattering quietly)

04:53.044 --> 04:55.079
HEFTY JEFF:
Yeah, we did it!

04:55.113 --> 04:57.882
(laughing, chattering)
(siren chirping)

04:57.883 --> 05:00.885
Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no. Everybody,
be cool! Oh, God. Oh, God.

05:00.886 --> 05:02.586
(hyperventilating):
Oh, God. Oh, God.

05:02.587 --> 05:04.288
Oh, God.
Evening, sir.

05:04.289 --> 05:05.723
Evening, uh, Officer.

05:05.724 --> 05:07.925
I'm, uh, teaching a class
on, um...

05:07.926 --> 05:09.560
creative... driving.

05:09.561 --> 05:11.061
Creative driving?
Yeah,

05:11.062 --> 05:12.563
it's a special, um...

05:12.564 --> 05:14.131
(whispers): Elective. elective.

05:14.132 --> 05:16.133
Pass-fail.
It's pass-fail, but that's...

05:16.134 --> 05:18.469
(chuckles)
unnecessary information.

05:18.503 --> 05:20.938
(quietly): You're
an adjunct professor. I got it.

05:20.939 --> 05:23.174
All right. Have a good
class, Professor.

05:23.175 --> 05:25.609
Really?
Go, go, go, go!

05:25.610 --> 05:28.212
Bob, you're a hero.
You made the prank.

05:28.246 --> 05:29.480
You're a sick old man.

05:29.481 --> 05:30.814
Is that a good thing?
Yes!

05:30.815 --> 05:33.250
Gentlemen, I think Bob
deserves a beer.

05:33.251 --> 05:35.119
Uh, you just gave me one,
so I'm good.

05:35.120 --> 05:36.420
I didn't finish.

05:36.421 --> 05:38.923
Bob deserves a beer...
out of Beta.

05:38.924 --> 05:41.125
(chanting):
Beta, Beta, Beta!

05:41.159 --> 05:43.161
Wow, really?
Are-are you sure?

05:43.162 --> 05:45.062
I mean, that's
disgusting, t...

05:45.096 --> 05:46.463
(chanting):
Beta, Beta!

05:46.464 --> 05:48.165
Wow. Which end do I drink from?

05:48.166 --> 05:50.534
Dealer's choice.
Uh, I guess I'll-I'll do mouth.

05:50.535 --> 05:52.536
You don't know what you're
missing from the butt, Bob.

05:52.537 --> 05:55.506
All right, I'll do butt.
(cheering)

05:55.540 --> 05:58.309
Oh, my God. I just drank
from a lizard's butt!

05:58.310 --> 06:00.811
Reload!
No, no, no. I'm good, guys.

06:00.812 --> 06:03.314
I'm good.
Well, maybe one more.

06:03.315 --> 06:06.717
♪ Every time I scratch my nails
down someone else's back ♪

06:06.718 --> 06:08.886
♪ I hope you feel it

06:08.887 --> 06:11.388
♪ Do you feel it?!
(whoops)

06:11.389 --> 06:13.357
Betas!
(cheering)

06:13.391 --> 06:15.392
BOB:
<i>Yeah, give me the lizard again!</i>

06:15.393 --> 06:16.794
TURD:
<i>I'll go get it!</i>

06:18.751 --> 06:20.185
A: <i>You're off to
the frat house already?</i>

06:20.219 --> 06:21.820
Yeah, the guys are playing
Beer Beer Goose,

06:21.821 --> 06:23.321
so I'm gonna
make lunch. You know,

06:23.322 --> 06:25.190
now I kind of regret
not going to college.

06:25.224 --> 06:27.192
You regret not going
to college? Come on.

06:27.193 --> 06:29.360
It's not like you ended up
flipping burgers.

06:29.361 --> 06:30.728
Oh, wait...

06:30.763 --> 06:32.475
Why don't you take
the kids with you?

06:32.498 --> 06:35.099
A house full of boys?
I can't go. I have plans.

06:35.100 --> 06:36.601
Just kidding.
Let's go.

06:37.670 --> 06:38.970
Hey! There he is!

06:39.004 --> 06:41.873
Everybody, Bob's here!
(cheering)

06:41.907 --> 06:44.742
(chuckles) Uh, hey, guys.
I brought my kids.

06:44.777 --> 06:48.246
This is great. I can't not
step on cold pizza.

06:48.247 --> 06:50.715
Upside-down couch for hiding?
And forts.

06:50.749 --> 06:52.584
This is the biggest
man-cave ever.

06:52.585 --> 06:54.018
And Tina's going spelunking.

06:54.019 --> 06:55.720
No, Tina. No. PUD: Hey, Bob.

06:55.754 --> 06:58.256
(quietly): Word of warning:
Slowhand's here.

06:58.290 --> 07:00.191
Slowhand?
Oh, oh, the alum?

07:00.192 --> 07:01.459
Yeah, he's in the bathroom.
(toilet flushes)

07:01.460 --> 07:03.361
Shh, guys, I think he's coming.

07:03.395 --> 07:06.130
Comin' back from the bathroom
entrance music!

07:06.131 --> 07:08.433
(imitates hip-hop beat)

07:08.467 --> 07:10.635
Dr. Yap? I thought
I'd never see you again

07:10.636 --> 07:12.070
until my next
dental appointment.

07:12.071 --> 07:13.266
You're Slowhand?

07:13.272 --> 07:14.639
Bob, what are
you doing here?

07:14.640 --> 07:16.140
I'm filling in
for the cook.

07:16.141 --> 07:18.142
Oh, great, great.
Hi, kids.

07:18.143 --> 07:20.311
How are you doing?
Are you flossing, Beana?

07:20.312 --> 07:21.746
(chuckles)
Yap, yap, yap, yap.

07:21.747 --> 07:23.248
(chuckles)

07:23.282 --> 07:25.583
Hey, you signed up
for the Slowhand Memories Tour?

07:25.618 --> 07:27.452
Actually, I should get
into the kitchen.

07:27.453 --> 07:29.287
Leaving now!
Keep up!

07:29.288 --> 07:31.623
and that's where I had
my first French hug.

07:31.624 --> 07:33.391
That's where you
feel a girl's armpits.

07:33.392 --> 07:35.593
We done, Yap? We've hit
every room in the house.

07:35.594 --> 07:37.996
Not every room.
Behind this very door

07:37.997 --> 07:40.398
are Betas' greatest
treasures,

07:40.399 --> 07:42.233
our darkest mysteries

07:42.234 --> 07:43.835
and our washer-dryer.

07:43.836 --> 07:45.069
Pause for laughter.

07:45.070 --> 07:46.804
Only brothers may enter

07:46.805 --> 07:48.806
the Room of Secrets,

07:48.807 --> 07:50.174
(echoes):
Secrets, Secrets, Secrets.

07:50.175 --> 07:51.943
Shh.

07:51.977 --> 07:53.745
You kids want to
see inside, huh?

07:53.746 --> 07:56.114
Sure.
No! What did I tell you?

07:56.115 --> 07:57.649
Brothers only.

07:57.650 --> 07:59.884
Okay, Yap, we get it.
Moving on.

07:59.919 --> 08:02.287
Last stop. That was the last stop.
You said that was the last stop.

08:02.288 --> 08:04.088
DR. YAP: Yap, yap, yap, yap.
One more. There's one more thing.

08:04.123 --> 08:06.858
Yeah, the best way to keep your
secrets hidden is to put 'em

08:06.859 --> 08:09.794
in a room labeled
"Room Of Secrets."

08:09.795 --> 08:11.596
Damn it!

08:11.597 --> 08:14.632
And finally, the Beta House
Wall of Honor.

08:14.667 --> 08:17.268
Hey, wait a second. What's this?

08:17.303 --> 08:19.270
Whoa, Hefty Jeff,
you framed that already?

08:19.305 --> 08:21.773
I'm the house historian.
His dad owns a frame shop.

08:21.807 --> 08:23.508
Are you freaking kidding me?!

08:23.542 --> 08:24.609
Slowhand,
calm down.

08:24.643 --> 08:26.210
No, you calm down, Pud!

08:26.211 --> 08:28.446
You let a non-brother
drink out of Beta?!

08:28.480 --> 08:31.983
And he crooned in my
Crooner Corner? "B" to the "S"!

08:32.017 --> 08:35.119
It's okay. Bob helped us prank
the crap out of the Alphas.

08:35.154 --> 08:37.755
You'll prank with these guys
but you won't prank with us?

08:37.789 --> 08:39.477
We put the dead fish
in their AC.

08:39.491 --> 08:41.125
What?! That was my prank!

08:41.126 --> 08:42.961
Why wasn't I in on my prank?

08:42.962 --> 08:44.395
You should have called me!

08:44.396 --> 08:46.297
I put my number in all
of your cell phones.

08:46.332 --> 08:48.967
Bob had a car, the fish
was starting to smell...

08:49.001 --> 08:50.234
I bought that fish!

08:50.235 --> 08:51.736
That's why when I have a fish

08:51.737 --> 08:53.738
I write my name on it
in permanent marker.

08:53.739 --> 08:56.307
Sorry, Yap.
I didn't know it was your fish.

08:56.308 --> 08:57.742
You're right, Slowhand,
we screwed up.

08:57.743 --> 08:59.410
If you want to take time off
from hanging out here,

08:59.411 --> 09:01.145
we would understand.

09:01.180 --> 09:03.681
No, that won't be necessary.
The important thing is

09:03.682 --> 09:06.084
you guys finally sacked up
and pranked those Alphas.

09:06.085 --> 09:08.619
Yeah, Operation Bob-Fish
was a huge success.

09:08.654 --> 09:10.521
Yap-Fish! It was a Yap-Fish!

09:10.556 --> 09:12.590
(whispering):
History will say it was a Bob-Fish.

09:12.591 --> 09:14.387
I'm so proud of my dad.

09:14.393 --> 09:15.693
GRETCHEN:
<i>That stuff about Bob's problems</i>

09:15.694 --> 09:16.894
<i>in the bedroom</i>

09:16.929 --> 09:19.163
was great. You are
a natural saleswoman.

09:19.164 --> 09:21.032
Thanks! Selling's easy.
You just tell lies

09:21.033 --> 09:22.667
about your husband
and you're all set.

09:22.668 --> 09:24.102
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Throw it all out. What?

09:24.103 --> 09:26.437
Different crowd. See
that woman crying over there?

09:26.438 --> 09:28.506
LINDA: Yeah. GRETCHEN:
The one with too much eye shadow.

09:28.540 --> 09:30.908
Oh, it's awful. No, I know.
Anyway, she just got dumped.

09:30.909 --> 09:32.176
You tell me why.

09:32.211 --> 09:33.745
Aw. Her friends
threw her this party.

09:33.746 --> 09:35.413
Right. Think you got
an angle for her?

09:35.414 --> 09:37.248
Maybe. Yes.
I don't know.

09:37.249 --> 09:38.516
Good. Save it.
Okay.

09:38.517 --> 09:40.251
Let's go sell
some sex toys!

09:40.252 --> 09:42.420
(whoops) Ow. Ow.
What? And Linda? Here.

09:42.421 --> 09:44.422
Your own Pleasureologist coat.
(gasps)

09:44.423 --> 09:46.891
Aw! Welcome to
the Pleasureologist family.

09:46.925 --> 09:49.527
(sobs)
Hey. Listen, sweetie.

09:49.528 --> 09:51.262
I just broke up, too.
Huh?

09:51.263 --> 09:53.765
Yeah. I broke up with my
husb... my boyfriend.

09:53.766 --> 09:55.433
Oh, yeah?
Bob. Jerk.

09:55.434 --> 09:57.602
But guess what.
I found somebody better.

09:57.603 --> 10:00.605
The Sneaky Pete! Oh, hi,
it's nice to meet you.

10:00.606 --> 10:02.140
(laughs)
What's your name?

10:02.141 --> 10:04.375
I'm Susan.
Susan, hi.

10:04.376 --> 10:05.375
Hi, Pete.

10:05.377 --> 10:06.444
I like you, Susan.

10:06.445 --> 10:08.246
I got a crush on you.

10:08.247 --> 10:10.181
I never felt
this way before.

10:10.215 --> 10:12.884
I want to go home with you
with your bedside drawer

10:12.885 --> 10:15.186
and live there forever.
(giggles)

10:15.220 --> 10:16.721
Oh, now she's smilin'.
(whoops)

10:16.722 --> 10:18.790
We got another one!
Tell her about the holster.

10:18.791 --> 10:20.291
TINA: <i>Dad,
what do you think the frat boys</i>

10:20.325 --> 10:22.460
keep in their
Room of Secrets?

10:22.461 --> 10:25.430
I don't know, Tina, but whatever
it is, it attracts ants.

10:25.464 --> 10:27.632
Well, don't you worry.
Today we're getting in

10:27.633 --> 10:28.966
or Gene dies trying.

10:28.967 --> 10:29.967
You got it!

10:30.002 --> 10:31.269
Guys, you heard Dr. Yap.

10:31.270 --> 10:33.371
That room is off-limits
to non-brothers.

10:33.405 --> 10:35.406
You're not a brother.
I'm basically a brother.

10:35.407 --> 10:37.475
I'm more of a brother
than you are, Gene.

10:37.476 --> 10:39.110
You've never even
touched the iguana!

10:39.144 --> 10:42.046
I drank from its ass!
Are you okay, Dad?

10:42.081 --> 10:45.216
(sighs) I just... I like those
guys. And-and they like me.

10:45.250 --> 10:47.919
<i>And it's not just
because we're always drunk.</i>

10:47.920 --> 10:50.321
Oh, my God.

10:50.355 --> 10:52.190
TINA: Dr. Yap! What happened here?

10:52.191 --> 10:53.958
The Alphas hit us, man!

10:53.959 --> 10:55.493
They got us, man!

10:55.494 --> 10:57.228
Pretty hard, bro!

10:57.262 --> 10:59.464
This could be payback
for Operation Bob-Fish.

10:59.465 --> 11:00.765
Yap-Fish.

11:00.766 --> 11:03.167
And the worst thing is
they took...

11:03.168 --> 11:04.469
they took...

11:04.503 --> 11:06.270
A long, hard look
at your lifestyle?

11:06.305 --> 11:07.305
No!

11:07.306 --> 11:08.639
They took Beta!

11:10.309 --> 11:12.610
(screams)
Beta!

11:15.532 --> 11:17.200
No!

11:17.201 --> 11:19.602
I want everyone to see
what the Alphas did to me.

11:19.603 --> 11:21.004
What happened,
Slowhand?

11:21.005 --> 11:23.339
I just came by the house
with a new karaoke CD...

11:23.340 --> 11:24.607
<i>Steady Rocking Booty Jams.</i>

11:24.608 --> 11:25.975
Volume Two.

11:26.010 --> 11:28.878
Suddenly,
the Alpha president barged in

11:28.879 --> 11:30.613
with his foot soldiers.

11:30.614 --> 11:32.849
First they held me down
and shaved me,

11:32.850 --> 11:34.817
then they flung me over here,

11:34.818 --> 11:36.786
and shoved me over there,

11:36.787 --> 11:38.521
and beat up my face!

11:38.522 --> 11:40.290
And then they took Beta!

11:40.324 --> 11:41.224
(gasps)

11:41.225 --> 11:43.126
Oh, and they left this.

11:43.160 --> 11:45.528
HEFTY JEFF:
No, no, no, no, no!

11:45.562 --> 11:47.397
Friggin' Alphas!

11:47.398 --> 11:48.665
They have no respect
for anything!

11:48.666 --> 11:50.199
I'm gonna go pee
out the window.

11:50.200 --> 11:51.567
You pee out the window?

11:51.568 --> 11:53.269
That settles it:
I'm going to college!

11:53.304 --> 11:54.337
Poor Beta.

11:54.338 --> 11:55.638
You drank out
of his butt.

11:55.639 --> 11:56.906
What are the
standards here?

11:56.941 --> 11:58.975
In my day, if the Alphas hit us,

11:58.976 --> 12:01.144
we hit 'em back twice as hard!

12:01.145 --> 12:03.780
Brothers, this is war.

12:03.781 --> 12:06.015
And if that means I need to move
back into the house

12:06.016 --> 12:08.084
for the foreseeable future,
so be it.

12:08.085 --> 12:09.752
And it does mean that.

12:09.753 --> 12:11.020
Oh...
okay.

12:11.021 --> 12:12.322
Get my room ready, Turd!
I'm in.

12:12.323 --> 12:13.556
Not... I mean,
not to move in.

12:13.557 --> 12:15.358
But to help.
We won't...

12:15.359 --> 12:16.693
probably won't
need you at all, Bob.

12:16.694 --> 12:18.328
I'll do...
I'll do whatever.

12:18.329 --> 12:20.163
I'm in it for the
long haul, brothers!

12:20.164 --> 12:21.864
Yeah, we need Bob
now more than ever!

12:21.865 --> 12:23.032
Yeah!
Bob's one of us!

12:23.067 --> 12:24.067
All right, it's...

12:24.068 --> 12:25.668
All right, it's fine.

12:25.669 --> 12:27.203
Thanks, Bob. You're in.
Let's get 'em!

12:27.237 --> 12:29.372
Yeah! Let's get 'em! Yeah!

12:29.406 --> 12:30.707
LOUISE:
Yeah, go get 'em!

12:30.741 --> 12:32.008
Take your time,

12:32.009 --> 12:33.543
don't come back for a while!

12:33.544 --> 12:34.777
Betas!

12:34.778 --> 12:38.047
Room of Secrets,
time to spill your guts!

I hate that guy!

Is it a guy?

13:19.456 --> 13:20.790
He's the dean.
He's nice.

Well, probation or not,
this isn't over

13:22.593 --> 13:24.660
until we show the Alphas
they can't get away

13:24.661 --> 13:26.229
with disrespecting
our lizard.

13:26.230 --> 13:27.630
What about
Dean Dixon's letter?

13:27.631 --> 13:28.931
Shouldn't we
lay low?

13:28.932 --> 13:30.566
Turd's got a point.
Thank you.

13:30.567 --> 13:32.468
I'm one semester away
from graduating.

13:32.469 --> 13:34.637
Oh, Pud, there are
no jobs out there.

13:34.638 --> 13:36.439
You know that, right?
Listen to Bob.

13:36.440 --> 13:38.074
Even though he's technically
not even a brother.

13:38.075 --> 13:39.475
Well, if Bob's
on board...

13:39.476 --> 13:40.910
You know I'm
on board, T-bird.

13:40.911 --> 13:42.145
Yeah,
B-bow.

13:42.146 --> 13:43.179
The B-T express!
(chuckles)

13:43.180 --> 13:44.680
Choo choo!

13:44.681 --> 13:46.482
We're coming to awesome town!
Okay, yeah...

13:46.483 --> 13:48.751
Just two passengers today,
Turd and Bob! Brother...

13:48.752 --> 13:50.153
(imitates train whistle)

13:50.154 --> 13:53.289
Brothers, and not-really
brothers, I give you...

13:53.290 --> 13:55.191
Operation Spit Take.

13:55.192 --> 13:57.026
Wow.
Wow.

13:57.027 --> 14:00.396
If I can't get the secrets out,
I'm gonna put my secrets in.

14:00.431 --> 14:02.165
(quietly):
I have a cat under my bed.

14:02.166 --> 14:05.368
I've had it for eight months.

14:05.369 --> 14:08.104
(quietly):
I know about Gene's secret cat.

14:08.138 --> 14:10.139
(groans) I can't believe
we'll never know what secrets

14:10.140 --> 14:11.874
are in the Room
of Secrets!

14:11.875 --> 14:14.277
Or what laundry is
in the Room of Secrets.

14:14.278 --> 14:16.279
Wait a minute. If the building's
old and crappy,

14:16.280 --> 14:18.114
there might be a laundry chute.

14:18.115 --> 14:21.117
Oh, that's weird. I was correct.

14:21.118 --> 14:22.618
Ladies.
(whoops)

14:22.653 --> 14:24.020
(whoops)

14:24.021 --> 14:25.354
Whoo-whoo-hoo!

14:25.389 --> 14:28.124
(grunts)
Let's check out some secrets.

14:28.125 --> 14:29.358
I'm good.
Tina!

14:29.359 --> 14:30.693
Yeah?
Those aren't yours.

14:30.694 --> 14:32.163
Oh, how-how'd
these get on?

14:32.196 --> 14:33.563
DR. YAP:
<i>Tonight, none other</i>

14:33.564 --> 14:35.131
<i>than Dean Dixon is hosting</i>

14:35.165 --> 14:38.134
a banquet recognizing
campus community service.

14:38.168 --> 14:39.902
And their guest of honor?
Guess who.

14:39.903 --> 14:42.538
It's the president of
those iguana-thieving Alphas!

14:42.539 --> 14:44.107
Getting a special award

14:44.141 --> 14:45.842
for their so-called
"dedication to raising

14:45.876 --> 14:49.145
thousands of dollars
for cancer research."

14:49.179 --> 14:50.313
OTHERS:
Boo!

14:50.347 --> 14:52.348
But what this douchebot
doesn't know

14:52.349 --> 14:54.083
is that an award
for fighting cancer

14:54.084 --> 14:55.818
isn't all he's going
to get tonight!

14:55.853 --> 14:58.054
Yeah, not if the Betas
have anything to do with it.

14:58.055 --> 14:59.054
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!

14:59.056 --> 15:00.223
To the Beta-mobile!

15:00.224 --> 15:02.391
We've got Alphas to crush!

15:02.426 --> 15:03.860
Oh, crap, the kids.

15:03.861 --> 15:05.695
Uh, you guys g-go ahead.

15:05.696 --> 15:07.830
I'll meet you there. Uh, Betas!

15:07.831 --> 15:09.398
Check out the past brothers.

15:09.433 --> 15:11.868
Mmm, if those sideburns
could talk.

15:11.902 --> 15:13.536
Here's a magazine about jugs.

15:13.537 --> 15:15.414
Their secret is
they love pottery?

15:15.439 --> 15:17.373
Did I mishear them?
Is this actually called

15:17.374 --> 15:19.041
the Room of Suck-rets?

15:19.076 --> 15:20.576
No, I think
we heard them correctly.

15:20.577 --> 15:22.044
It's the Room of Secrets.
Well,

15:22.079 --> 15:23.679
these secrets suck!

15:23.714 --> 15:25.348
Oh, here's Dr. Yap's class.

15:25.349 --> 15:27.350
It's Beta!

15:28.385 --> 15:30.019
And a bunch of tiny clothes.

15:30.020 --> 15:32.255
Oh, Beta's starting
his own fashion line.

15:32.256 --> 15:35.324
No, dummy. This means the Alphas
never stole the iguana!

15:35.359 --> 15:38.227
Hey, you guys aren't
supposed to be in... Beta?

15:38.262 --> 15:41.063
We found him in the wall
behind Dr. Yap's class photo.

15:41.064 --> 15:42.698
Why would Beta be here
in the house?

15:42.699 --> 15:44.534
Unless Yap made up
that whole story.

15:44.535 --> 15:45.635
He wouldn't.

15:48.272 --> 15:49.539
He would. He would. He would.

15:49.540 --> 15:50.540
Who would?
Dr. Yap.

15:50.541 --> 15:51.741
Oh, yeah, he would.

15:51.775 --> 15:53.576
Oh, my God.
We have to stop him

15:53.577 --> 15:55.454
before he gets those kids
kicked out of school.

15:55.479 --> 15:57.280
It's all right,
they can move in with us.

15:57.281 --> 15:58.748
Dibs on Turd.
(grumbles)

16:00.910 --> 16:01.943
BOB:
<i>I can't believe it.</i>

16:01.978 --> 16:03.478
Yap made up
the whole thing?

16:03.479 --> 16:05.113
He's been pranking
his own frat!

16:05.114 --> 16:06.815
It's the ones
you least suspect.

16:06.816 --> 16:08.350
Sometimes.
Not this time.

16:12.188 --> 16:14.690
(indistinct conversations)

16:16.125 --> 16:17.359
Oh, good, Bob.

16:17.360 --> 16:18.827
I thought you might
have wussed out.

16:18.828 --> 16:20.595
You're just in time
to see the Alphas

16:20.596 --> 16:21.830
pay for taking Beta.

16:21.831 --> 16:22.931
I know what you did, Yap.

16:22.932 --> 16:23.932
It's over.

16:23.933 --> 16:25.400
Recognize this iguana?

16:25.435 --> 16:27.669
(gasping)

16:27.704 --> 16:29.705
Recognize this iguana tail?

16:29.706 --> 16:31.039
Or these briefs?

16:31.040 --> 16:32.307
Just curious.
They're mine now.

16:32.342 --> 16:34.710
Okay, Bob, you got me.
I took Beta.

16:34.711 --> 16:36.611
I thought a prank war would
bring the brothers together

16:36.612 --> 16:38.513
and show them
how much I mean to them.

16:38.548 --> 16:40.148
So it wasn't the Alphas at all.

16:40.149 --> 16:42.084
Those damn Alphas
don't even know we exist.

16:42.118 --> 16:44.820
Yeah, they seem pretty focused
on their charity work.

16:44.854 --> 16:46.688
I've been TPing
our house for years

16:46.689 --> 16:48.023
just to get this thing going.

16:48.024 --> 16:50.359
Okay, this fake
prank war ends now.

16:50.360 --> 16:52.561
The brothers are already
on probation, Yap.

16:52.562 --> 16:53.829
Prank the Alphas here

16:53.830 --> 16:55.063
and you'll get
the house shut down.

16:55.064 --> 16:56.732
So what?
They'll be legends!

16:56.733 --> 16:58.734
Oh, no.
What's the prank, Yap?

16:58.735 --> 17:00.235
Well, since you're
too late to stop it,

17:00.236 --> 17:01.536
I'll tell you.

17:01.537 --> 17:03.038
First, I dressed

17:03.072 --> 17:05.640
<i>as a waiter
and snuck into the banquet</i>

17:05.641 --> 17:06.842
<i>while they were setting up.</i>

17:06.876 --> 17:09.310
Oh, my God,
how long is this story?

17:09.345 --> 17:11.646
YAP: <i>Then I drilled
a hole in the stage,</i>

17:11.681 --> 17:13.080
and underneath
I planted

17:13.082 --> 17:16.218
the splatter-master
saliva keg!

17:16.219 --> 17:17.994
The what? Are you insane?

17:18.020 --> 17:19.554
I don't know.

17:19.555 --> 17:21.256
Is it insane to collect
the spit of every patient

17:21.257 --> 17:23.224
who's passed through my office
for the past six months

17:23.226 --> 17:24.693
and put it in a pony keg?

17:24.727 --> 17:26.528
Absolutely. Not necessarily.
Hmm... No.

17:26.561 --> 17:27.996
Right now, all the Betas

17:28.030 --> 17:29.464
<i>are under the stage
with the keg,</i>

17:29.499 --> 17:31.600
waiting for that Dean Dixon

17:31.601 --> 17:33.602
to introduce his Alpha lapdog.

17:33.603 --> 17:35.871
And when the Alpha president
steps up to the podium?

17:35.872 --> 17:37.072
Sploosh.

17:37.106 --> 17:38.240
This is
a great plan.

17:38.241 --> 17:39.241
We're doing this!

17:39.242 --> 17:40.242
No, we're not, Louise.

17:40.243 --> 17:41.843
Come on, Yap.
No!

17:41.844 --> 17:43.512
It's all so easy for
you, isn't it, Bob?

17:43.513 --> 17:45.080
You just moseyed
into the Beta house

17:45.081 --> 17:46.515
and stole
their hearts

17:46.516 --> 17:48.901
with your hamburgers
and your perfect body.

17:48.918 --> 17:50.385
Yap, I'm sorry, okay?

17:50.386 --> 17:51.620
And I get it.

17:51.621 --> 17:52.954
The fraternity's great.

17:52.955 --> 17:54.856
It's like being
in a family of guys

17:54.857 --> 17:56.091
with beer and karaoke.

17:56.092 --> 17:58.026
Sucker punch!
(grunts)

17:58.027 --> 17:59.594
We're definitely
switching dentists!

17:59.595 --> 18:00.896
No!

18:00.930 --> 18:02.564
You'll never get
a better family dentist

18:02.565 --> 18:04.399
who's in your provider network!
(laughing)

18:04.434 --> 18:05.555
DIXON:
Hello, I'm Dean Dixon,

18:05.568 --> 18:07.402
and you're all expelled.

18:07.403 --> 18:08.937
Just kidding.

18:08.938 --> 18:10.205
Except for you, you're expelled.
Just kidding.

18:10.239 --> 18:11.973
Oh, God.
He started his intro.

18:11.974 --> 18:13.241
I've got
to do something.

18:13.242 --> 18:14.476
You're too
late, Dad.

18:14.477 --> 18:15.877
You'll never
stop it now.

18:15.878 --> 18:17.446
I've got to try.

18:17.480 --> 18:18.780
Uh, now I'd like to introduce

18:18.781 --> 18:20.415
a truly outstanding young man...

18:20.416 --> 18:21.750
Me! Hello!

18:21.784 --> 18:24.920
I am the honoree's, uh,
twin brother.

18:24.954 --> 18:25.953
Hmm?

18:28.090 --> 18:29.925
But I'm 20 years old.

18:29.926 --> 18:31.426
Excuse me. Uh...

18:31.427 --> 18:33.428
That's okay, Dean.
Thanks. Have a seat.

18:33.429 --> 18:34.663
You know what I like
about my brother?

18:34.664 --> 18:36.164
He's nice.

18:36.165 --> 18:38.166
He-he wouldn't hurt a fly,
much less...

18:38.167 --> 18:40.735
I don't know, I'm just naming
animals here... an iguana.

18:40.770 --> 18:42.003
LOUISE:
Boo!

18:42.004 --> 18:43.405
Please have her removed.

18:43.439 --> 18:45.974
I want everyone
in the room to know,

18:45.975 --> 18:49.177
even people who might be
under the stage right now,

18:49.178 --> 18:51.947
that the Alpha president would
not hurt or kidnap an iguana.

18:51.948 --> 18:53.148
Right?

18:53.182 --> 18:54.916
Maybe he would!
No, he wouldn't!

18:54.951 --> 18:56.351
Those are the kind of things

18:56.352 --> 18:58.753
our crazy oldest brother
would do, though.

18:58.754 --> 19:01.756
You know, our crazy,
Asian dentist older brother?

19:01.791 --> 19:04.926
I'd point him out,
but I have a slow hand.

19:04.961 --> 19:07.162
A slow hand.

19:07.196 --> 19:09.164
Dad should leave the
jokes to Dean Dixon.

19:09.165 --> 19:10.499
Ha, ha. Ha, ha, ha.

19:10.500 --> 19:11.733
Come on, help Dad out.

19:11.767 --> 19:13.468
(quietly):
Are you talking to us?

19:13.503 --> 19:15.071
(quietly):
Don't set off the spit keg.

19:15.104 --> 19:18.039
Um, let's go out
and ask him what he means.

19:19.308 --> 19:21.042
Hi. How are you?

19:21.043 --> 19:22.444
Excuse me,
who are these young men?

19:22.478 --> 19:24.346
I probably should have
come to rehearsal.

19:24.380 --> 19:25.614
(screaming)

19:25.648 --> 19:29.117
(slow motion):
No, Yap, no!

19:34.991 --> 19:36.591
Dad, um, you've got a little...

19:36.626 --> 19:38.560
On your... Bit right here.

19:39.529 --> 19:41.730
I did it! Betas!

19:41.731 --> 19:43.632
Yap, yap, yap, yap, yap, yap,
yap, yap, yap, yap, yap, yap,

19:43.633 --> 19:45.133
yap, yap, yap, yap, yap, yap!

19:47.036 --> 19:48.803
What-what are we working with here?
What's goin' on?

19:48.804 --> 19:50.171
Are these cougars?
Cougar,

19:50.206 --> 19:51.206
cougar... LINDA: Oof.

19:51.207 --> 19:52.307
Cougar.

19:52.308 --> 19:53.542
Kind of
a cougar-poodle mix.

19:53.543 --> 19:54.843
LINDA: Uh-huh. Cougar-doodle.

19:54.844 --> 19:56.044
LINDA: Aw. Ah! Oh, ho, ho, ho.

19:56.045 --> 19:57.479
Wow.

19:57.480 --> 19:59.247
Cougar-doodle
opened the sample case.

19:59.248 --> 20:00.515

20:02.818 --> 20:04.152
Wow, hi, guys.

20:04.186 --> 20:05.720
I brought the guys for burgers.

20:05.721 --> 20:07.656
I've kind of been
forgetting to feed them.

20:07.657 --> 20:09.658
Sorry Dean Dixon banned you
and Slowhand from campus.

20:09.659 --> 20:11.092
But thank you.

20:11.093 --> 20:12.894
'Cause, you know,
you de-Yapified us.

20:12.895 --> 20:15.430
With that guy banned from the frat,
my GPA might go up.

20:15.431 --> 20:16.898
Yeah, sorry Yap
called you a nerd

20:16.899 --> 20:18.166
