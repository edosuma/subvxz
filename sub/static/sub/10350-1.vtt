01:06.430 --> 01:08.890
This is Mr Mathison.
He's a doctor.

01:10.600 --> 01:14.650
- Are you okay?
- An ambulance is on the way.

01:14.730 --> 01:16.690
Thank you.

01:22.950 --> 01:24.910
Is there a name yet?

01:26.200 --> 01:28.160
Elijah.

01:32.620 --> 01:35.710
Is he supposed
to be crying like this?

01:35.830 --> 01:37.790
May I?

01:53.270 --> 01:55.230
Can I have him back?

01:59.860 --> 02:02.150
What happened during the delivery?

02:02.240 --> 02:04.900
Nothing.
It was very quick.

02:04.990 --> 02:07.120
The babyjust wanted
to come right out.

02:07.240 --> 02:09.199
And there were no problems.

02:11.410 --> 02:13.710
Did you drop him?

02:13.790 --> 02:15.750
What?

02:15.870 --> 02:18.000
Did you drop this baby?

02:18.080 --> 02:20.040
Jesus Christ, no.

02:25.260 --> 02:28.260
Inform the ambulance
that we have a situation.

02:28.340 --> 02:31.310
All right.
Molly.

02:31.390 --> 02:34.230
I've never seen this.

02:37.190 --> 02:41.020
It appears that your baby
has sustained some fractures...

02:41.150 --> 02:43.110
while inside your uterus.

02:46.700 --> 02:48.660
His arms and his legs are broken.

03:38.920 --> 03:40.960
This is Eastrail 177.

03:41.080 --> 03:43.210
Nextstop, Philadelphia.

04:17.160 --> 04:19.120
Are you alone?

04:20.829 --> 04:22.880
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

05:08.960 --> 05:11.170
Someone left this magazine.

05:11.260 --> 05:13.220
Want to take a look at it?

05:13.340 --> 05:15.300
Could I take a look at that one?

05:21.730 --> 05:23.600
Thanks.

05:23.690 --> 05:26.610
- You like sports?
- It's my field.

05:26.690 --> 05:28.650
I represent athletes.
I'm an agent.

05:30.690 --> 05:33.950
Are you looking for any
male synchronized swimmers?

05:34.070 --> 05:36.870
- I'm thinking about getting into that.
- Is that right?

05:40.290 --> 05:42.250
I'm afraid ofwater.

05:42.370 --> 05:44.330
Think that's a problem?

05:51.880 --> 05:54.800
You represent someone
in Philadelphia?

05:54.880 --> 05:57.100
I'm meeting this player
from Temple University.

05:57.220 --> 05:59.180
He's a cornerback.

05:59.310 --> 06:03.060
This kid is 6'1 ", 210 pounds.

06:03.140 --> 06:07.310
He runs a 40 in 4,3 seconds.
He's gonna be a god.

06:07.400 --> 06:10.400
Do you like football?

06:10.480 --> 06:12.440
Not really.

06:23.750 --> 06:27.420
- I'm David Dunn.
- Kelly.

06:27.540 --> 06:30.290
- Hi.
- Hi, nice to meet you.

06:30.380 --> 06:32.340
Nice - Nice to meet you.

06:39.970 --> 06:42.520
How long are you gonna be
in Philadelphia?

06:50.690 --> 06:53.780
- I'm married.
- Great.

06:53.900 --> 06:56.740
- I'm sorry.
- What are you talking about?

06:59.530 --> 07:01.740
I--

07:01.870 --> 07:06.160
I think you misunderstood
what I was, uh...

07:06.250 --> 07:08.370
- s-saying--
- I know.

07:11.000 --> 07:13.300
I think I'm gonna find another seat.

07:13.420 --> 07:15.880
I-I didn't mean, uh--

08:55.520 --> 08:58.780
That's what he failed to realize.
I look classy, not trashy.

08:58.900 --> 09:03.700
I look classy too. What about me?
Don't I look classy?

09:03.820 --> 09:06.200
But I'm afraid you forgot this!

09:06.330 --> 09:10.500
- And this! And--
- Where has you been, Banana?

09:10.580 --> 09:12.790
Now I've got you, weasel.

09:12.920 --> 09:17.630
Some cars are still on fire,
and the debris is everywhere.

09:17.710 --> 09:19.590
We are notsure at this time, uh...

09:19.710 --> 09:22.180
how rescue personnel will be able
to get on scene at all.

09:22.300 --> 09:24.840
If you're just tuning in,
Eastrail train number 177...

09:24.970 --> 09:27.350
has derailed
just outside Philadelphia.

09:27.470 --> 09:29.770
And we're bringing you
live coverage from Skycam 4.

09:29.890 --> 09:32.190
Yes, that is-- It appears
to be a rescue ambulance...

09:32.310 --> 09:35.230
and there are more behind it
I can see on the access road.

09:35.310 --> 09:37.770
I don't know how close they're
gonna be able toget, David.

09:37.900 --> 09:40.690
These are woodsand, uh, trees.

09:40.780 --> 09:43.150
It's gonna be a very
difficult rescue effort.

09:59.300 --> 10:01.260
Try to hack some of that off.

10:14.190 --> 10:17.860
Hi. I'm Dr Dubin.

10:17.980 --> 10:21.650
You're in the emergency room in
the Philadelphia City Hospital.

10:21.780 --> 10:23.740
You were in a serious accident.

10:24.900 --> 10:27.200
Look at me.

10:27.280 --> 10:29.240
How are you feeling?

10:31.160 --> 10:33.370
- Okay.
- Good.

10:33.450 --> 10:35.920
I'm gonna ask you some questions.

10:36.000 --> 10:39.750
Have you ever had any heart
or asthma problems in the past?

10:39.880 --> 10:44.050
- No.
- Kidney or renal problems?

10:44.130 --> 10:46.590
- No.
- Any allergies?

10:49.010 --> 10:50.970
No.

10:55.810 --> 10:57.770
Where were you sitting
on the train?

11:01.820 --> 11:04.650
- Against the window.
- In the passenger car?

11:06.900 --> 11:08.870
Yeah.

11:11.120 --> 11:14.870
- Where are the other passengers?
- Was your family travelling with you?

11:17.540 --> 11:19.420
No.

11:19.540 --> 11:22.250
Did you get up from your seat?

11:27.880 --> 11:30.890
Are you certain
you were in the passenger car?

11:36.180 --> 11:38.140
Yes.

11:45.740 --> 11:48.570
Why are you looking at me like that?

11:48.650 --> 11:50.700
Your train derailed.

11:50.780 --> 11:53.530
Some kind of malfunction.

11:53.620 --> 11:56.580
They only found
two people alive so far--

11:56.660 --> 11:58.620
you and this man.

12:01.040 --> 12:04.380
His skull was cracked open and
most of his left side was crushed.

12:06.550 --> 12:08.670
And to answer your question,
there are two reasons...

12:08.760 --> 12:11.760
why I'm looking at you like this.

12:11.890 --> 12:14.680
One, because it seems
in a few minutes...

12:14.760 --> 12:19.060
that you will officially be
the only survivor of this train wreck.

12:19.140 --> 12:22.060
And two...

12:22.150 --> 12:24.110
because you didn't break one bone.

12:25.570 --> 12:27.530
You don't have a scratch on you.

14:13.630 --> 14:15.590
David?

14:18.260 --> 14:22.180
What happened in New York?

14:24.020 --> 14:26.400
I don't think I got the job.

14:28.230 --> 14:31.400
I'm still going to, uh--

14:31.480 --> 14:34.240
I'm still moving there.

14:34.320 --> 14:36.280
Just--

14:37.450 --> 14:39.410
Uh, just - just not now.

14:44.460 --> 14:46.580
Good night.

14:49.750 --> 14:51.710
Good night.

15:03.730 --> 15:05.770
Sara Elaston...

15:05.850 --> 15:09.020
social worker at
Broad and Locust Community Centre.

15:10.270 --> 15:12.400
We pray foryour soul.

15:14.610 --> 15:17.700
Kevin Elliot, businessman...

15:17.820 --> 15:20.700
father of six.

15:20.780 --> 15:22.740
We pray for your soul.

15:24.370 --> 15:26.500
Glen Stevens...

15:26.620 --> 15:29.880
researcher in the area
of leukemia...

15:30.000 --> 15:31.960
at Drexel University.

15:33.800 --> 15:35.760
We pray for your soul.

15:37.590 --> 15:39.720
Jennifer Pennyman...

15:39.840 --> 15:44.020
third-grade teacher
at Jefferson Elementary.

15:46.230 --> 15:48.190
We pray for your soul.

16:55.290 --> 16:58.460
- Yes?
- Is Noel in, ma'am?

16:58.550 --> 17:00.510
No, sir, he is not.

17:01.970 --> 17:04.800
I read about you in the paper.

17:04.890 --> 17:08.140
- What?
- I was in an accident once too.

17:08.220 --> 17:11.230
A horse almost trampled me to death.

17:11.310 --> 17:13.270
- Wow.
- Had him put down.

17:15.980 --> 17:17.940
That's a sad story.

17:20.859 --> 17:25.740
Could-- Could you ask Noel
something for me, please?

17:25.869 --> 17:27.990
Proceed.

17:28.119 --> 17:30.160
Would you ask him to check
how many sick days I've taken...

17:30.250 --> 17:32.370
since I've worked here?

17:32.460 --> 17:35.330
- That the entire message?
- Yes, ma'am.

17:39.260 --> 17:41.220
Thankyou.

18:19.500 --> 18:21.300
Hey, Noel.

18:21.380 --> 18:23.590
What, you hit your head on that train?

18:23.720 --> 18:25.680
Get your brain
to start working again?

18:27.260 --> 18:29.970
- What?
- Forty dollars.

18:31.600 --> 18:34.310
- Forty dollars what?
- You're gettin' a $40-a-week raise.

18:34.390 --> 18:36.350
That's it.

18:37.520 --> 18:40.690
I checked. You were right.
You've never taken a sick day.

18:40.820 --> 18:44.490
Five years, no sick day.
I get it. You want a raise.

18:44.610 --> 18:46.570
Smart way to make your point.

19:13.310 --> 19:15.850
- Is Joseph okay?
- Yeah.

19:15.980 --> 19:18.520
- He's asleep.
- Oh.

19:22.530 --> 19:25.610
I wanted to ask you a question.

19:25.740 --> 19:27.950
It's gonna sound a little strange,
but, uh...

19:28.030 --> 19:30.990
just think about it
for a second, okay?

19:31.080 --> 19:33.790
Okay.

19:33.870 --> 19:36.000
When's the last time I was sick?

19:36.120 --> 19:38.080
Do you remember?

19:41.670 --> 19:43.630
Um, I-I don't know.

19:45.720 --> 19:48.550
It's been a while.

19:48.630 --> 19:52.390
I haven't been sick this year,
I know that.

19:52.510 --> 19:54.640
Okay.

19:54.720 --> 19:56.680
Do you remember me gettin' sick?

19:59.900 --> 20:02.190
Um...

20:02.270 --> 20:04.570
not a specific day.

20:04.650 --> 20:06.860
And what's-what's this about?

20:09.160 --> 20:12.660
Audrey, do you remember me
ever getting sick?

20:12.780 --> 20:15.660
In the three years
we lived in this house?

20:15.750 --> 20:17.790
In the old apartment?

20:17.910 --> 20:20.880
Before Joseph was born?
Before we ever got married?

20:25.210 --> 20:27.170
I-I can't remember.

20:29.090 --> 20:31.390
Don't you think
that's kind of weird...

20:31.510 --> 20:35.680
not remembering one cold
or a-a fever or a sore throat?

20:37.980 --> 20:39.940
What do you think it means?

20:44.730 --> 20:47.650
Um...

20:47.740 --> 20:51.570
I think it means
I'm probably too tired to remember.

21:33.030 --> 21:37.410
No more sittin' in this room.
I let it go on long enough.

21:37.490 --> 21:40.660
I'm not goin' out there any more.
I'm not getting hurt again.

21:40.750 --> 21:45.040
- This was the last time, I told you.
- You can't do anything about that.

21:45.170 --> 21:47.460
You might fall between
this chair and that television.

21:47.590 --> 21:50.590
If that's what God has planned for you,
that's what's gonna happen.

21:50.670 --> 21:53.050
You can't hide from it
sittin' in a room.

21:57.140 --> 22:00.980
They call me Mr Glass at school
because I break like glass.

22:06.110 --> 22:08.070
You make this decision now...

22:09.530 --> 22:11.490
to be afraid...

22:13.150 --> 22:15.280
and you will never turn back.

22:17.030 --> 22:21.830
Your whole life,
you will always be afraid.

22:36.680 --> 22:39.220
- I got a present for you.
- Why?

22:40.930 --> 22:42.890
Forget why.

22:45.520 --> 22:47.480
You want it or not?

22:50.480 --> 22:52.690
Well, go get it, then.

22:52.780 --> 22:55.740
Where is it?

22:55.820 --> 22:58.450
On a bench...

22:58.530 --> 23:00.490
across the street.

23:14.590 --> 23:16.550
Someone's gonna take it.

23:18.590 --> 23:21.350
Then you better get out there soon.

24:35.800 --> 24:37.760
I bought a whole bunch.

24:42.300 --> 24:44.350
There'll be one of these
waitin' for you...

24:44.470 --> 24:46.600
every time you want
to come out here.

24:53.360 --> 24:56.440
They say this one
has a surprise ending.

25:05.370 --> 25:08.370
This is from Fritz Campion's
own library.

25:08.500 --> 25:13.380
This is before the first issue of
the comic book hit the stands in 1968.

25:13.500 --> 25:17.550
It's a classic depiction
of good versus evil.

25:17.630 --> 25:21.630
Notice the square jaw of Slayer,
common in most comic heroes.

25:21.720 --> 25:25.470
And the slightly disproportionate size
of Jaguaro's head to his body.

25:25.560 --> 25:29.640
This again is common,
but only in villains.

25:29.730 --> 25:32.100
The thing to notice about this piece...

25:32.230 --> 25:36.230
the thing that makes it
very, very special...

25:36.320 --> 25:39.400
is its realistic depiction
of its figures.

25:39.490 --> 25:41.530
When the characters
reached the magazine...

25:41.610 --> 25:43.660
they were exaggerated...

25:43.780 --> 25:45.990
as always happens.

25:46.120 --> 25:49.870
This is vintage.

25:52.750 --> 25:54.710
Well...

25:59.840 --> 26:02.300
wrap it up.

26:02.430 --> 26:04.800
You've made a considerably
wise decision.

26:10.270 --> 26:12.230
Well, my kid's gonna go berserk.

26:15.810 --> 26:17.860
Once again, please?

26:17.940 --> 26:20.740
My son Jeb--
it's a gift for him.

26:20.820 --> 26:23.700
- How old is Jeb?
- He's four.

26:26.700 --> 26:28.740
No.

26:28.870 --> 26:32.620
No, no, no, no, no.

26:34.120 --> 26:36.500
You need to go. Now.

26:38.290 --> 26:40.420
What'd - What'd I say?

26:40.510 --> 26:43.840
Do you see any Teletubbies in here?

26:43.930 --> 26:45.970
Do you see a slender plastic tag
clipped to my shirt...

26:46.050 --> 26:48.180
with my name printed on it?

26:48.300 --> 26:51.220
Did you see a little Asian child with
a blank expression sitting outside...

26:51.310 --> 26:55.060
in a mechanical helicopter that shakes
when you put quarters in it?

26:55.140 --> 26:58.730
No? Well, that's what
you see at a toy store...

26:58.860 --> 27:00.820
and you must think
you're in a toy store because...

27:00.940 --> 27:04.450
you're here shopping
for an infant named Jeb.

27:04.570 --> 27:07.570
Now, one of us
has made a gross error...

27:07.660 --> 27:10.830
and wasted the other person's
valuable time.

27:10.950 --> 27:13.080
This is an art gallery,
my friend...

27:13.160 --> 27:16.920
and this is a piece ofart.

27:32.270 --> 27:34.230
We're by appointment only.

27:36.020 --> 27:38.650
- I got a card from this store.
- Congratulations.

27:38.730 --> 27:42.320
You have a mailbox.
The exhibition isn't for two weeks.

27:42.440 --> 27:45.280
This one was under
the windshield wiper of my car.

27:48.160 --> 27:51.240
How certain are you that
you've never taken ill?

27:51.330 --> 27:53.870
Seventy-five percent.

27:53.950 --> 27:57.370
Well, that's not
certain at all, is it?

27:58.830 --> 28:01.750
That's hole number one.

28:01.840 --> 28:05.010
I'm going to be extremely skeptical
about all this.

28:05.130 --> 28:07.090
About all what?

28:08.630 --> 28:11.800
I'm assuming you've never been injured.
Would I be wrong in that assumption?

28:11.930 --> 28:13.890
Dad's been injured.

28:15.220 --> 28:18.230
Is the child correct?

28:18.310 --> 28:22.440
Yes, sir. In college,
I was in a car accident.

28:22.520 --> 28:27.400
- Was it serious?
- He couldn't play football any more.

28:27.490 --> 28:29.450
That's hole number two.

28:31.280 --> 28:33.240
That's a big one.

28:36.870 --> 28:40.790
Mr Price, can we talk about
the note that you left on my car?

28:40.920 --> 28:44.170
I've studied the form
of comics intimately.

28:44.250 --> 28:46.300
I've spent a third of my life
in a hospital bed...

28:46.380 --> 28:49.550
with nothing else to do but read.

28:49.630 --> 28:51.590
I believe comics
are our last link...

28:51.720 --> 28:55.390
to an ancient way
of passing on history.

28:55.520 --> 28:57.640
The Egyptians drew on walls.

28:57.770 --> 29:02.020
Countries all over the world still pass
on knowledge through pictorial forms.

29:02.110 --> 29:04.230
I believe comics
are a form of history...

29:04.360 --> 29:07.940
that someone somewhere
felt or experienced.

29:08.030 --> 29:10.320
Then, of course,
those experiences and that history...

29:10.450 --> 29:13.450
got chewed up in the commercial
machine, got jazzed up...

29:13.570 --> 29:16.450
made titillating,
cartooned for the sale rack.

29:17.830 --> 29:21.250
This city has seen its share
of disasters.

29:21.330 --> 29:23.790
I watched the aftermath
of that plane crash.

29:23.920 --> 29:26.460
I watched the carnage
of the hotel fiire.

29:26.550 --> 29:31.430
I watched the news waiting to hear
a very specifiic combination of words...

29:31.550 --> 29:34.010
but they never came.

29:34.140 --> 29:37.890
Then one day I saw a news story
about a train accident...

29:37.970 --> 29:40.020
and I heard them.

29:40.100 --> 29:42.150
"There is a sole survivor...

29:42.270 --> 29:45.360
and he is miraculously unharmed."

29:48.400 --> 29:51.820
I have something called
osteogenesis imperfecta.

29:51.950 --> 29:53.910
It's a genetic disorder.

29:54.030 --> 29:55.990
I don't make a particular
protein very well...

29:56.120 --> 29:58.660
and it makes my bones
very low in density.

29:58.750 --> 30:01.040
Very easy to break.

30:01.120 --> 30:03.670
I've had 54 breaks in my life...

30:03.750 --> 30:08.550
and I have the tamest version
of this disorder, type one.

30:08.630 --> 30:12.300
There are type two,
type three, type four.

30:12.430 --> 30:14.390
Type fours don't last very long.

30:16.050 --> 30:19.060
So that's how it popped into my head.

30:19.140 --> 30:21.980
If there is someone
like me in the world...

30:22.060 --> 30:24.270
and I'm at one end
of the spectrum...

30:24.400 --> 30:26.440
couldn't there be someone else...

30:26.520 --> 30:28.730
the opposite of me
at the other end?

30:28.860 --> 30:33.240
Someone who doesn't get sick, who
doesn't get hurt like the rest of us?

30:33.320 --> 30:37.080
And he probably
doesn't even know it.

30:37.200 --> 30:42.410
The kind of person
these stories are about.

30:42.500 --> 30:47.630
A person put here
to protect the rest of us.

30:47.710 --> 30:49.750
To guard us.

30:52.220 --> 30:56.760
- You think my dad's a real--
- I don't think anything right now.

30:56.890 --> 30:59.350
It's a possibility--

30:59.430 --> 31:01.390
one with many holes.

31:04.980 --> 31:07.650
Joseph, don't take
another sip of that water.

31:10.820 --> 31:12.860
- Go throw it in the trash.
- But Dad--

31:12.990 --> 31:14.950
Do it now, please.

31:24.620 --> 31:28.210
I see guys like you
all the time in my work.

31:28.330 --> 31:31.840
You find someone you want
to take advantage of...

31:31.920 --> 31:35.340
you tell them a fantastic story...

31:35.470 --> 31:38.340
and somewhere in there you say it:

31:38.430 --> 31:41.390
"I just need
your credit card number...

31:41.470 --> 31:43.430
a small down payment."

31:46.140 --> 31:48.100
This morning was the first morning
that I could remember...

31:48.230 --> 31:50.190
that I didn't open my eyes
and feel...

31:53.070 --> 31:55.190
sadness.

31:58.780 --> 32:01.950
I thought the person that wrote
that note had an answer for me.

32:08.880 --> 32:11.880
I'm gonna leave now.

32:12.000 --> 32:13.960
Good luck with your exhibition.

32:14.090 --> 32:16.550
So, what kind ofjob
do you have, David?

32:16.670 --> 32:18.720
You said you've met guys like me
in your work.

32:18.800 --> 32:23.350
- What exactly is it that you do?
- I work at the University Stadium.

32:23.470 --> 32:26.020
I'm a security guard.

34:41.739 --> 34:43.949
Hi.

34:44.030 --> 34:46.870
I've come to a decision.

34:46.949 --> 34:49.330
Okay.

34:49.409 --> 34:51.949
I just wanna ask you something, okay?

34:52.040 --> 34:55.540
And you can be totally honest.

34:55.670 --> 34:59.250
I'm prepared for any answer,
and-and it won't affect me.

35:01.880 --> 35:04.680
Have you been with anyone?

35:04.760 --> 35:06.970
I mean, since we've
been having problems.

35:07.100 --> 35:09.060
The answer won't affect me.

35:12.310 --> 35:14.980
I just need to know, you know?

35:15.060 --> 35:17.020
I mean, it won't affect me
either way.

35:19.480 --> 35:21.440
No.

35:29.370 --> 35:31.580
Sorry, David.
I'm sorry.

35:36.920 --> 35:39.040
Anyway...

35:39.170 --> 35:41.130
my decision is...

35:44.420 --> 35:46.380
that I want to start again.

35:50.050 --> 35:52.810
And I want it to be
like it was in the beginning.

35:56.190 --> 35:59.520
And it's a big deal that
you walked away from that train.

36:02.480 --> 36:04.530
I feel like it's a second chance.

36:10.740 --> 36:14.000
And if you feel like
asking me out sometime...

36:14.080 --> 36:16.040
that'd be okay.

36:18.540 --> 36:20.500
Okay.

36:33.220 --> 36:35.770
- Dunn.
- Go for Dunn.

36:35.850 --> 36:40.150
Yeah, it's Jenkins. Look, we got a guy
over at gate 17-C with a bogus ticket.

36:40.230 --> 36:44.280
Says he knows you.
He won't tell me his name.

36:44.360 --> 36:47.070
What's he look like?

36:47.150 --> 36:49.360
Why is it, do you think, that
of all the professions in the world...

36:49.450 --> 36:51.410
you chose protection?

36:53.530 --> 36:56.330
- You are a very strange man.
- You could have been a tax accountant.

36:56.410 --> 36:59.290
You could have owned your own gym. You
could've opened a chain of restaurants.

36:59.370 --> 37:01.750
You could've done
one of 10,000 things.

37:01.880 --> 37:06.010
But in the end,
you chose to protect people.

37:06.090 --> 37:08.550
You made that decision,
and I find that...

37:08.670 --> 37:10.640
very, very interesting.

37:11.970 --> 37:14.890
Now all I need is
your credit card number.

37:16.020 --> 37:17.980
That last part was a joke.

37:22.190 --> 37:26.650
- You're a big sports fan, are you?
- It's starting to intrigue me.

37:27.990 --> 37:30.360
It gets heaviest
ten minutes before kickoff.

37:42.790 --> 37:45.090
Programme here.
Programme.

37:45.170 --> 37:47.130
Programme.

37:48.970 --> 37:52.720
Programme. Programme here.

37:52.840 --> 37:54.800
- Rich, why don't we pat down?
- Right.

37:54.930 --> 37:56.890
-Just give me a minute.
- Is there a problem?

37:57.010 --> 37:58.980
I'm sorry.
I'm gonna have to search you.

37:59.100 --> 38:02.440
- It's nothing personal.
- The tall guy in the camouflage jacket.

38:02.560 --> 38:07.110
Sometimes people carry weapons in here,
and they drink too much.

38:07.190 --> 38:11.820
If the team's not doing good,
bad things can happen.

38:11.950 --> 38:15.200
We do pat-downs of the crowd
to discourage people from carrying.

38:16.620 --> 38:19.250
If he's carrying,
he'll step out of line.

38:32.380 --> 38:34.340
Yeah, step right up here.

38:43.520 --> 38:48.320
Okay. I got you a seat up
in the yellow section.

38:48.400 --> 38:53.200
It's in the nosebleeds,
but at least you won't get spit on.

38:53.320 --> 38:55.530
- All right.
- How'd you know that guy you bumped...

38:55.660 --> 38:57.620
was carrying a weapon?

38:59.790 --> 39:02.000
I don't know.

39:02.120 --> 39:06.500
Maybe it was that camouflage
armyjacket he was wearing.

39:06.630 --> 39:09.380
Those guys like to carry
hunting knives and stuff for show.

39:09.460 --> 39:12.800
You thought he was carrying a knife?

39:12.920 --> 39:14.261
I thought he was
carrying something, yeah.

39:14.394 --> 39:16.010
But not a knife.

39:19.640 --> 39:24.600
I got a picture of a silver gun
with a black grip...

39:24.690 --> 39:26.900
tucked in his pants.

39:27.020 --> 39:29.400
You know, like on TV.

39:30.860 --> 39:33.700
You have good instincts
for things like that?

39:33.780 --> 39:34.591
Like what?

39:34.826 --> 39:37.200
Knowing when people
have done something wrong.

39:40.700 --> 39:43.790
- Yeah.
- Have you ever tried to develop it?

39:45.790 --> 39:49.880
- I don't know what you're asking me.
- Your skill.

39:49.960 --> 39:52.090
Look, I gotta be down on
the sidelines during the game.

39:52.210 --> 39:54.420
- You can get to your seat right down--
- Characters in comics...

39:54.550 --> 39:57.010
are often attributed special powers--

39:57.140 --> 40:01.600
invisibility, X-ray vision,
things of that sort.

40:01.680 --> 40:04.230
Okay.

40:04.350 --> 40:08.980
- I don't wanna play this game any more.
- It's an exaggeration of the truth.

40:09.060 --> 40:14.280
Maybe it's based on something
as simple as instinct.

40:14.360 --> 40:16.990
- But he might not have been carrying anything.
- But he might have been carrying...

40:17.070 --> 40:19.950
a silver gun with a black grip
tucked in his pants.

40:20.030 --> 40:22.870
- Dunn.
- I gotta go.

40:25.290 --> 40:27.500
Yeah, I know.
I'll be right down.

40:27.620 --> 40:30.790
- One last question.
- What?

40:30.920 --> 40:33.300
That car accident you were in.

40:33.380 --> 40:35.340
Was there anyone else involved?

40:37.590 --> 40:40.930
Yeah.
My wife, Audrey.

40:41.010 --> 40:43.060
She was in the car with me.

40:45.180 --> 40:48.100
Have a good life, Elijah.

40:48.190 --> 40:51.520
Next time, try to buy your tickets
at an authorized sales location.

40:51.650 --> 40:55.690
- Dunn.
- I'm on my way.

40:59.740 --> 41:01.950
...into the investigation
of train 177...

41:02.080 --> 41:05.240
being conductedat the Eastrail
holding warehouses.

41:05.330 --> 41:07.870
The citycouncil has
stepped up plans to pass a bill...

41:07.960 --> 41:11.290
requiring higher standards
for inspection and maintenance...

41:11.380 --> 41:14.050
of all rail transportation
for Philadelphia...

41:14.130 --> 41:16.090
and its outlying districts.

41:23.890 --> 41:25.520
Hold up a second!

42:20.570 --> 42:23.200
I just want to ask you something.

43:32.930 --> 43:35.600
Dad! Hey, Dad!

43:42.530 --> 43:44.490
Dad!

43:55.580 --> 43:59.340
Joseph, do you know how mad your mother would
be if she knew you were playing football?

43:59.420 --> 44:02.260
Are you gonna tell?

44:02.340 --> 44:05.760
You wanna play last ofthe downs?
We got a big guy like you.

44:05.880 --> 44:10.010
You could play on opposite sides.
He's Potter's cousin.

44:10.100 --> 44:12.640
He's starting cornerback
at Temple University.

44:12.720 --> 44:14.770
He's going pro in the draft.

44:14.890 --> 44:18.310
They say he can run the
40 Yards in 4,3 seconds.

44:18.440 --> 44:20.310
Yeah, I've heard.

44:20.440 --> 44:22.400
You can beat him, Dad.

44:22.530 --> 44:24.990
- Let's beat him.
- I'm gonna go in.

44:25.070 --> 44:27.700
Just play one set ofdowns.
I told them you were great.

44:27.780 --> 44:29.740
- Why'd you do that?
-Just one.

44:29.870 --> 44:31.990
I'm gonna go in.
I've got some things to do.

44:32.080 --> 44:34.870
- What things?
- I'm gonna work out.

44:34.950 --> 44:36.580
- I'll help you.
- No, I-I don't need--

44:36.660 --> 44:40.420
I can't play, guys!
I'm working out with my dad!

44:40.540 --> 44:43.550
Go, go.
Here we go! Ready?

44:43.630 --> 44:46.800
Hut! You're doing good.
Right there! Catch!

44:46.920 --> 44:49.220
I've got to run

44:49.300 --> 44:51.850
To keep from hiding

44:51.970 --> 44:54.270
And I'm bound

44:54.390 --> 44:56.850
To keep on riding

44:56.980 --> 45:01.610
And I've got one more silverdollar

45:01.690 --> 45:03.820
How much did you put on there?

45:12.700 --> 45:16.450
You put too much.
That's 250 pounds.

45:16.580 --> 45:20.330
How much can you lift?

45:20.460 --> 45:22.500
That's the most I ever lifted.

45:25.000 --> 45:27.800
That could've been dangerous,Joseph.

45:27.880 --> 45:30.260
Why don't you go upstairs now
and let me finish up, okay?

45:30.340 --> 45:33.140
I'll take it off.
I'll help you right.

45:37.600 --> 45:41.270
You think you could have
beaten up Bruce Lee?

45:41.350 --> 45:43.150
No.

45:43.270 --> 45:45.730
I mean, if you knew karate.

45:45.860 --> 45:47.820
No.

45:51.910 --> 45:54.990
Well, what if he wasn't allowed to kick,
and you were really mad at him?

45:55.120 --> 45:57.080
No, Joseph.

46:38.450 --> 46:41.160
How much did you take off?

46:43.040 --> 46:45.590
I lied.

46:48.130 --> 46:50.090
You added?

46:58.010 --> 46:59.970
How much is it?

47:01.480 --> 47:03.440
270 pounds.

47:07.020 --> 47:08.980
Let's put more.

47:12.280 --> 47:13.740
Okay.

47:17.910 --> 47:20.660
Why don't you move back a little
just to be safe, okay?

47:53.530 --> 47:55.410
More?

48:06.710 --> 48:10.550
You should never do anything like this.
You know that, right?

48:12.340 --> 48:14.800
What do you do
if something bad happens?

48:14.920 --> 48:17.390
Get Mom.

48:17.510 --> 48:19.390
Right.

48:54.590 --> 48:57.380
How much did you put on that time?

49:01.300 --> 49:03.180
All of it.

49:04.930 --> 49:06.890
What else can we use?

49:33.540 --> 49:35.510
How much is it?

49:44.470 --> 49:46.430
How much is it, Dad?

49:49.440 --> 49:51.980
About 350 pounds.

49:59.200 --> 50:01.160
Fracture of the fifth metacarpal
of the right hand...

50:01.240 --> 50:04.580
as well as multiple fractures of
the sixth, seventh and eighth ribs.

50:04.700 --> 50:07.250
The worst of the injury, however,
was sustained to the right leg...

50:07.330 --> 50:09.290
in the form of a spiral fracture.

50:09.410 --> 50:11.370
There were 14 breaks.

50:11.500 --> 50:14.380
It simply shattered.

50:14.460 --> 50:17.000
They call me Mr. Glass.

50:17.130 --> 50:20.800
- Who does?
- Kids.

50:20.930 --> 50:22.970
Are you all right, Mr Price?

50:23.090 --> 50:25.050
Shall I continue?

50:26.430 --> 50:28.810
Pins were placed throughout
the length of the leg.

50:28.890 --> 50:31.640
The use of a wheelchair will be needed
for a two-month period.

50:31.730 --> 50:35.150
The use of crutches will follow
for 12 to 14 months.

50:35.230 --> 50:37.360
Hospital stay will range
from fiive to eight days...

50:37.480 --> 50:40.320
followed by 9 to 12 months
of physical therapy.

50:40.400 --> 50:43.110
Prescribed medication for pain
management will take the usual forms...

50:43.200 --> 50:45.990
of morphine drip, percocet, darvocet.

50:57.500 --> 50:59.550
Your, uh, 10:00 is here.

50:59.670 --> 51:01.800
The hospital discharged him
this morning.

51:04.010 --> 51:05.970
Thanks.

51:14.440 --> 51:15.900
Elijah, right?

51:15.980 --> 51:19.820
We're gonna prevent any substantial
atrophy ofyour good leg with this...

51:19.900 --> 51:22.110
and it works your quadriceps.

51:23.280 --> 51:25.490
How long have you been married?

51:28.200 --> 51:31.120
- Twelve years.
- How'd you get together?

51:33.410 --> 51:35.380
I'm a little nervous being here.

51:35.500 --> 51:38.920
I ask too many questions
when I'm nervous.

51:41.050 --> 51:43.010
A car accident.

51:43.130 --> 51:46.890
Oh. And now you're gonna
have to tell me more.

51:51.270 --> 51:53.730
My husband was a star athlete
in college...

51:53.850 --> 51:55.900
and we were in
an accident together.

51:57.520 --> 51:59.900
Our car flipped on an icy
road and we were both injured,

51:59.901 --> 52:01.570
and he couldn't play football any more.

52:01.650 --> 52:04.400
And if that hadn't happened,
we probably wouldn't have been together.

52:04.530 --> 52:08.200
- How so?
- I think we should talk about your rehab.

52:08.320 --> 52:10.620
You don't have to answer
if you don't want to.

52:11.790 --> 52:15.290
So, tell me more
about the quad machine.

52:16.620 --> 52:19.540
It prevents atrophy by--

52:21.300 --> 52:23.510
I couldn't spend my life
with someone who played football.

52:23.590 --> 52:25.550
It's pretty much that simple.

52:26.760 --> 52:29.930
I mean, I don't hate the game. I admire
the amount of skill it involves.

52:30.050 --> 52:32.810
And-And like everyone else,
I was in awe of the way he played it.

52:32.930 --> 52:37.150
But football, in many ways,
is the opposite of what I do.

52:38.440 --> 52:40.900
You're rewarded the more
you punish your opponent.

52:41.020 --> 52:44.440
You know, it's too much about violence,
and I don't want violence in my life.

52:45.780 --> 52:49.450
It's not a thing many people
can understand, but--

52:49.530 --> 52:52.620
Anyway, fate stepped in
with that car accident...

52:52.700 --> 52:54.910
and took football out of the equation.

52:55.040 --> 52:57.960
And everyone lived happily ever after.

53:00.000 --> 53:01.630
Sort of.

53:01.710 --> 53:04.380
What part of David's body was injured?

53:06.260 --> 53:09.090
Who said my husband's name was David?

53:16.850 --> 53:18.810
Ladies and gentlemen--

53:30.570 --> 53:32.530
In the first half--

54:01.730 --> 54:04.270
A 737 crashes on takeoff--

54:04.360 --> 54:07.280
172 die, no survivors.

54:07.400 --> 54:11.780
A hotel fire downtown--
211 die, no survivors.

54:11.860 --> 54:15.790
An Eastrail train derails
7 1/2 miles outside the city--

54:15.910 --> 54:17.870
131 die...

54:18.000 --> 54:20.040
one survivor.

54:20.160 --> 54:22.460
He is unharmed.

54:22.540 --> 54:25.460
I've spoken with your husband
about his survival.

54:25.550 --> 54:28.380
I suggested a rather
unbelievable possibility.

54:28.460 --> 54:31.630
Since then, I've come to believe
that possibility...

54:31.720 --> 54:33.680
however unbelievable...

54:33.800 --> 54:36.260
is now more a probability.

54:36.350 --> 54:39.180
And what was it you suggested?

54:39.310 --> 54:42.020
These are mediocre times, Mrs Dunn.

54:42.100 --> 54:45.690
People are starting to lose hope.
It's hard for many to believe...

54:45.770 --> 54:49.820
there are extraordinary things
inside themselves as well as others.

54:49.900 --> 54:52.990
I hope you can keep an open mind.

55:35.030 --> 55:37.580
Excuse me, sir?

55:37.700 --> 55:40.080
Can you step out of line, please?

55:44.250 --> 55:48.170
We've been having some problems with
people selling drugs here in the stadium.

55:48.290 --> 55:50.760
Would you mind if I check your pockets?

55:51.880 --> 55:54.590
Raise your arms, please.

55:54.680 --> 55:56.640
Come on, raise them up.

55:56.760 --> 55:58.970
I just got here, man.

56:09.570 --> 56:11.610
Can I put my hands down now?

56:17.370 --> 56:19.330
Can I go?

56:20.490 --> 56:22.450
Yeah.

56:24.040 --> 56:26.000
Hope you find them.

56:35.300 --> 56:39.600
- Yo, Dunn.
- Yeah.

56:39.680 --> 56:42.680
I just came into the office.
Your kid was hurt.

56:43.980 --> 56:47.150
- Where is he?
- Some play rehearsal at school.

56:47.270 --> 56:49.480
He wants you to come down there.

57:04.000 --> 57:06.460
Is that your dad?

57:09.710 --> 57:12.880
I bet my dad could beat up your dad.

57:16.340 --> 57:19.510
No, he, uh, he insisted
we call only you...

57:19.590 --> 57:21.640
though we had some trouble
tracking you down.

57:21.760 --> 57:23.810
I mean, you're not on our list.

57:25.100 --> 57:26.640
Audrey handles this type of stuff.

57:26.770 --> 57:29.480
Oh. What type of stuff?

57:30.940 --> 57:32.900
Joseph stuff.

57:36.030 --> 57:38.400
Do I need to put any smelly ointment
on him or anything?

57:38.530 --> 57:40.490
No, no, it's more emotional damage.

57:40.620 --> 57:44.120
Not, uh--
Not to serious, physically.

57:44.240 --> 57:47.750
Nothing like when I sent you
to the hospital.

57:51.710 --> 57:53.920
When was that?

57:54.000 --> 57:58.630
My office was on the other side
of the building back then.

58:01.090 --> 58:03.760
You don't remember me, do you?

58:05.810 --> 58:09.850
- No, ma'am.
- I had red hair.

58:12.110 --> 58:16.820
Well, you were a little younger
than Joseph when it happened.

58:16.940 --> 58:20.530
Did you know that we
changed the rules of conduct...

58:20.610 --> 58:23.370
around the pool because of you?

58:25.830 --> 58:27.790
The kids still tell about it...

58:27.910 --> 58:31.330
Like it was some sort of ghost story.

58:31.460 --> 58:35.750
"Did you know there was a kid
nearly drowned in that pool?

58:37.050 --> 58:40.380
He lay on the bottom of the pool
for five minutes.

58:40.510 --> 58:44.720
And when they pulled him out,
he was dead."

58:49.350 --> 58:53.400
We let them tell it.
It helps keep them safe.

58:56.980 --> 58:59.530
You still phobic of water?

59:02.530 --> 59:04.570
It was Potter and another guy.

59:05.910 --> 59:09.830
They were messing with
this Chinese girl in the dressing room.

59:09.950 --> 59:13.290
Y-You can't let bad things
happen to good people, right?

59:14.420 --> 59:17.920
That's your code, right?
That's the hero's code.

59:19.420 --> 59:21.380
I tried to make them stop...

59:21.510 --> 59:25.550
but they kept pushing me down,
and they wouldn't let me get back up.

59:28.390 --> 59:31.230
I thought maybe 'cause you're my dad...

59:32.350 --> 59:34.650
I thought I might be like you.

59:38.270 --> 59:40.230
I'm not like you.

59:42.150 --> 59:45.320
You are like me.

59:45.450 --> 59:47.660
We can both get hurt.

59:48.990 --> 59:53.210
- I'm just an ordinary man.
- No, you're not.

59:53.290 --> 59:56.130
Why do you keep saying that?

01:00:03.840 --> 01:00:07.100
Elijah Price came to visit me
at the centre today.

01:00:08.260 --> 01:00:11.100
Jesus.

01:00:11.220 --> 01:00:13.980
He didn't do anything. Hejust...

01:00:14.060 --> 01:00:16.020
told me his theory.

01:00:17.190 --> 01:00:19.860
That's sad when patients get like that.

01:00:19.940 --> 01:00:21.900
They lose reality.

01:00:26.910 --> 01:00:29.450
Joseph, what the hell are you doing?

01:00:29.530 --> 01:00:31.490
Oh, my God.

01:00:31.620 --> 01:00:35.370
You don't believe. I'll show you.
You can't get hurt.

01:00:35.500 --> 01:00:38.420
That gun's not loaded. He doesn't
know where I keep the bullets.

01:00:38.500 --> 01:00:41.500
In your Rookie of the Year trophy.

01:00:41.630 --> 01:00:44.380
Joseph, did you load the gun?

01:00:44.510 --> 01:00:48.180
- You won't get hurt.
- Elijah was wrong.

01:00:48.260 --> 01:00:50.720
- When did he meet Elijah?
- He was with me when I met him.

01:00:50.850 --> 01:00:52.810
No one believes him.

01:00:52.930 --> 01:00:55.850
Joseph, listen to me.

01:00:55.980 --> 01:01:01.110
Sometimes when people get sick or hurt
for a long time, like Elijah...

01:01:01.190 --> 01:01:05.030
their mind gets hurt too, and they
start to think things that aren't true.

01:01:05.150 --> 01:01:08.910
He told me what he thought
about your father. It isn't true.

01:01:09.030 --> 01:01:10.990
I'll show you.

01:01:13.660 --> 01:01:15.211
Do you remember the
story about the--

01:01:15.272 --> 01:01:17.710
about the boy that almost
drowned in the pool?

01:01:17.790 --> 01:01:20.460
That was me they were talking about.
I almost died. That was me.

01:01:20.540 --> 01:01:21.064
You're lying.

01:01:21.065 --> 01:01:23.300
I'm not lying, okay? I just
didn't remember it, that's all.

01:01:23.420 --> 01:01:25.550
Joseph, you know your father
was injured in college.

01:01:25.670 --> 01:01:28.510
You know that.
You know all about that.

01:01:29.640 --> 01:01:32.180
Don't do it.
He'll die,Joseph.

01:01:32.260 --> 01:01:36.730
- I'll just shoot him once.
-Joseph, listen to what your moth--

01:01:36.850 --> 01:01:38.810
Don't be scared.

01:01:40.060 --> 01:01:42.020
Joseph...

01:01:42.150 --> 01:01:44.690
if you pull that trigger,
I'm going to leave.

01:01:44.780 --> 01:01:48.110
Do you understand?
I'm going to go to New York.

01:01:48.240 --> 01:01:51.740
Y-Y-You're right.
If you pull that trigger...

01:01:51.820 --> 01:01:55.080
that bullet is just gonna bounce off me,
and I'm not going to be hurt.

01:01:55.160 --> 01:01:57.460
But then I'm going to go upstairs
and I'm gonna pack...

01:01:57.580 --> 01:02:00.750
and I'm going to leave for New York.

01:02:00.880 --> 01:02:05.760
- Why?
- Because I thought we were just
starting to be friends for real.

01:02:05.880 --> 01:02:07.840
And friends'll listen to each other.
They don't--

01:02:07.970 --> 01:02:11.800
And-And they don't shoot each other,
uh, uh, do they, Audrey?

01:02:11.890 --> 01:02:14.890
N-No shooting friends,Joseph.

01:02:15.010 --> 01:02:17.480
Joseph!

01:02:17.560 --> 01:02:20.650
You are about to be in big trouble!

01:02:21.810 --> 01:02:23.770
Now, I am your father,
and I am telling you...

01:02:23.900 --> 01:02:27.070
to put that goddamn gun down
right now!

01:02:27.190 --> 01:02:30.030
One, two--

01:02:48.970 --> 01:02:51.340
I followed the guy
in the camouflage jacket.

01:02:53.300 --> 01:02:58.730
He had a silver gun with a black grip
tucked in the back of his pants.

01:03:00.520 --> 01:03:03.770
Were you really injured
in that car accident in college?

01:03:03.860 --> 01:03:07.360
'Cause I believe you faked it.
I believe you took the opportunity...

01:03:07.440 --> 01:03:10.190
to end your football career,
no questions asked.

01:03:10.280 --> 01:03:14.030
And I think you did it,
of all things, for a woman.

01:03:14.120 --> 01:03:16.080
I guess that makes sense.

01:03:16.200 --> 01:03:19.450
Football's what, just ten years?

01:03:19.540 --> 01:03:24.080
But love?
Hmm. Now, that's forever.

01:03:26.460 --> 01:03:29.630
And that little bit of sadness
in the mornings you spoke of?

01:03:29.760 --> 01:03:31.970
I think I know what that is.

01:03:32.090 --> 01:03:35.600
Perhaps you're not doing
what you're supposed to be doing.

01:03:35.680 --> 01:03:37.640
Most guns have a black
or silver handle.

01:03:37.760 --> 01:03:39.720
I had a 50-50 shot
of getting the colour right.

01:03:39.850 --> 01:03:42.940
- That's not what I witnessed.
- Stop.

01:03:43.060 --> 01:03:46.310
Stop messing with my life, Elijah.

01:03:46.440 --> 01:03:50.030
My son almost shot me last night because
he wanted to prove you were right.

01:03:50.110 --> 01:03:52.070
I never said you couldn't be killed.

01:03:52.200 --> 01:03:54.160
- I never said that.
- My wife was right.

01:03:54.280 --> 01:03:59.080
There have been three major disasters,
and you were the only one unharmed.

01:03:59.200 --> 01:04:01.160
I have been sick.

01:04:03.410 --> 01:04:08.130
When I was a kid, I spent a week in the
hospital getting better from pneumonia.

01:04:08.210 --> 01:04:11.960
I almost drowned.
Two skinny little kids...

01:04:12.050 --> 01:04:15.550
were fooling around in a pool dunking me
and I swallowed some water.

01:04:15.640 --> 01:04:18.720
They didn't know it,
and it almost killed me.

01:04:18.850 --> 01:04:21.390
Heroes don't get killed like that.

01:04:21.520 --> 01:04:23.730
Normal people do, right?

01:04:25.350 --> 01:04:28.270
I don't need to see you any more, okay?

01:04:29.860 --> 01:04:32.320
Please stay away from my family.

01:04:41.040 --> 01:04:44.120
She said I could tell stories
that could make you cry

01:04:44.250 --> 01:04:46.290
What about you

01:04:46.370 --> 01:04:48.580
Hey, man, it's 20 after.
It's time to choose.

01:04:48.670 --> 01:04:50.630
I gotta head.

01:04:50.750 --> 01:04:54.970
And she sighed, ahh
lsaid, I want to be a singer

01:04:55.050 --> 01:04:58.470
You better not be jacking off to the
Japanese comics, I swear to God.

01:05:00.350 --> 01:05:03.430
Let's go, let's sit
Let's talk politics

01:05:03.560 --> 01:05:06.480
Goes so good with beer
And while we're at it, baby

01:05:06.560 --> 01:05:09.020
Why don't you tell me
one of your biggest fears

01:05:09.150 --> 01:05:12.230
I said, losing my penis
to a whore with disease

01:05:12.360 --> 01:05:14.490
Uh, look, man, I didn't
know you were in a--

01:05:14.570 --> 01:05:16.780
Losin'my life to
a whore with disease

01:05:16.860 --> 01:05:19.780
-Just choose something, all right?
- Excuse me, please

01:05:24.750 --> 01:05:26.710
The baby-sitter's here.

01:05:29.670 --> 01:05:32.840
- Should we cancel?
- I'm fine.

01:05:35.840 --> 01:05:38.590
We can do this another time.

01:05:38.720 --> 01:05:40.680
Don't lie.

01:05:42.760 --> 01:05:45.430
I'm fine. I just got mixed up.

01:05:52.770 --> 01:05:55.440
How about we just go
for a couple drinks?

01:06:01.120 --> 01:06:03.870
Okay, look, man,
I'm-I'm just gonna wheel you out.

01:06:03.950 --> 01:06:05.910
All right? You can think about things
outside on the sidewalk.

01:06:06.040 --> 01:06:08.000
I gotta get some chicken in me,
you know what I'm sayin'?

01:06:08.120 --> 01:06:11.290
I've been tired, I've been tired

01:06:11.380 --> 01:06:16.260
I've been tired, I've been tired
I've been tired

01:06:25.140 --> 01:06:28.390
- I told the tale of a girl
- Shit!

01:06:28.520 --> 01:06:30.730
She's a little bit older than me

01:06:30.850 --> 01:06:33.610
Strong legs, strong face
voice like milk

01:06:33.690 --> 01:06:35.650
Breasts like a cluster  of grapes

01:06:35.780 --> 01:06:38.070
I can't escape her ways

01:06:38.150 --> 01:06:40.110
She raise me

01:06:44.450 --> 01:06:48.450
- Dude.
- Even if you have no one

01:06:48.540 --> 01:06:50.580
Man, I don't care if you are in
a wheelchair. If you do that again...

01:06:50.670 --> 01:06:53.210
I'm calling 5-0.

01:06:53.290 --> 01:06:55.340
And while you're at it, baby

01:06:55.460 --> 01:06:57.420
Man.

01:07:03.010 --> 01:07:07.640
You don't want to sleep
aftersetting my loins on fire

01:07:07.720 --> 01:07:11.060
That's it, cracker jack. You're gonna
be sitting your ass in jail now.

01:07:11.190 --> 01:07:15.900
I've been tired, I've been tired
I've been tired

01:07:15.980 --> 01:07:19.490
I've been tired, I've been tired

01:07:29.250 --> 01:07:32.420
I've been tired, I've been tired

01:07:32.500 --> 01:07:35.670
- I've been tired, I've been tired
- How much for this one?

01:07:35.750 --> 01:07:37.210
I've been tired

01:07:38.710 --> 01:07:42.050
- Rust?
- Yeah.

01:07:42.180 --> 01:07:44.470
As a colour, not as rust.

01:07:44.590 --> 01:07:48.510
You know, like rust-coloured
paint or wood.

01:07:50.310 --> 01:07:53.560
- I didn't know that.
- Mm-hmm.

01:07:53.690 --> 01:07:56.230
Mine's still brown.

01:07:56.360 --> 01:07:58.320
Okay, my turn.

01:07:58.440 --> 01:08:00.650
Favourite song?

01:08:00.740 --> 01:08:04.860
"Soft and Wet" by the Artist
Formerly Known as Prince.

01:08:04.990 --> 01:08:07.280
What?

01:08:07.410 --> 01:08:10.160
We're supposed to be honest.

01:08:10.240 --> 01:08:12.620
"Soft And Wet."

01:08:12.750 --> 01:08:15.040
That's very interesting.

01:08:15.170 --> 01:08:17.130
Okay, my turn.

01:08:18.880 --> 01:08:21.090
When was the first time...

01:08:22.420 --> 01:08:25.430
the thought popped into your head
we might not make it?

01:08:26.970 --> 01:08:28.930
That's not the game.

01:08:29.060 --> 01:08:32.060
It's the first date.
There aren't any rules.

01:08:36.270 --> 01:08:39.770
- Don't know for sure.
- Think carefully.

01:08:41.109 --> 01:08:43.069
What about the game?

01:08:43.189 --> 01:08:45.149
It's over. I won.

01:08:47.200 --> 01:08:49.160
Look, maybe it wasn't
a specific moment.

01:08:49.279 --> 01:08:54.000
- Maybe it was a time--
- I had a nightmare one night...

01:08:54.120 --> 01:08:59.960
and I didn't wake you up so you
could tell me that it was okay.

01:09:01.460 --> 01:09:03.840
I think that was the first time.

01:09:05.880 --> 01:09:07.840
Does that count?

01:09:09.430 --> 01:09:11.390
That counts.

01:09:15.140 --> 01:09:18.979
Do you knowingly keep me
and Joseph at a distance?

01:09:26.740 --> 01:09:29.120
Yes.

01:09:29.240 --> 01:09:31.200
Why?

01:09:33.410 --> 01:09:35.370
I don't know.

01:09:39.920 --> 01:09:42.460
I just don't feel right, Audrey.

01:09:43.920 --> 01:09:46.300
Something's...

01:09:46.380 --> 01:09:48.590
just not right.

01:09:50.720 --> 01:09:53.890
Do you resent us, David?

01:09:53.970 --> 01:09:56.430
Resent the life you have?

01:09:58.390 --> 01:10:01.980
I mean, there were a lot of other things
you could've done after college.

01:10:02.110 --> 01:10:04.480
These were your choices.

01:10:09.160 --> 01:10:11.450
You know, even if it meant
we couldn't have been together...

01:10:11.530 --> 01:10:14.950
I never would've wished
that injury on you.

01:10:15.080 --> 01:10:17.540
What you could do physically...

01:10:17.620 --> 01:10:19.830
was a gift.

01:10:19.960 --> 01:10:22.710
I never would've wished it to go away.

01:10:24.960 --> 01:10:26.920
You know that, right?

01:10:31.180 --> 01:10:34.010
You had two calls after Joseph
went to bed. One came through...

01:10:34.100 --> 01:10:36.390
while I was on the other line,
but I wasn't talking too long.

01:10:36.470 --> 01:10:37.750
There was an emergency with my sister.

01:10:37.751 --> 01:10:40.310
She tried to do her own perm, and now
she looks like she stuck her head--

01:10:40.400 --> 01:10:42.520
Who called through?

01:10:42.610 --> 01:10:44.980
Um, someone from New York...

01:10:45.110 --> 01:10:47.150
uh, about a security job.

01:10:47.240 --> 01:10:50.410
They want to hire you. I didn't know
you guys were moving to New York.

01:10:50.530 --> 01:10:52.910
Thanks for telling me.

01:10:53.030 --> 01:10:55.580
We weren't all gonna move.

01:10:56.790 --> 01:10:58.750
Oh.

01:11:00.710 --> 01:11:04.040
I let the answering machine
pick up the other call.

01:11:08.170 --> 01:11:10.130
Great.

01:11:21.690 --> 01:11:25.440
Look, let'sjust be honest here.
We're just at the beginning...

01:11:25.570 --> 01:11:28.570
and I don't expect
you or I to change...

01:11:28.650 --> 01:11:31.110
the course of where
our lives were headed...

01:11:31.200 --> 01:11:33.490
because of one date.

01:11:33.570 --> 01:11:38.040
And if you do go to New York,
we can develop this.

01:11:38.120 --> 01:11:41.290
We'll just be forced to take it slow.

01:11:41.370 --> 01:11:45.130
And in the end, I think
that's defiinitely better.

01:11:47.670 --> 01:11:49.960
I mean, this is our second time around,
David. I didn't expect us...

01:11:50.050 --> 01:11:52.340
to get carried away.

01:11:54.590 --> 01:11:58.430
But I guess "congratulations"
is the right thing to say.

01:12:23.250 --> 01:12:25.460
David, it's Elijah.

01:12:25.580 --> 01:12:27.540
It was so obvious.

01:12:27.670 --> 01:12:29.960
It was this one issue
that brought it back for me--

01:12:30.090 --> 01:12:32.050
Century Comics 117.

01:12:32.170 --> 01:12:34.300
That's where this group,
the Coalition of Evil...

01:12:34.380 --> 01:12:36.840
tried to ascertain the weakness
of every superhero...

01:12:36.970 --> 01:12:40.390
because they all have one,
just like you.

01:12:40.470 --> 01:12:44.520
Your bones don't break.
Mine do. That's clear.

01:12:44.600 --> 01:12:48.020
Your cells react to bacteria
and viruses differently than mine.

01:12:48.150 --> 01:12:52.070
You don't get sick.
I do. That's also clear.

01:12:52.190 --> 01:12:57.490
But for some reason, you and I
react the exact same way to water.

01:12:57.570 --> 01:12:59.950
We swallow it too fast, we choke.

01:13:00.080 --> 01:13:02.290
We get some in our lungs, we drown.

01:13:02.410 --> 01:13:07.460
However unreal it may seem,
we are connected, you and I.

01:13:07.580 --> 01:13:12.210
We're on the same curve,
just on opposite ends.

01:13:12.340 --> 01:13:16.380
The point of all this is we
now know something we didn't.

01:13:16.470 --> 01:13:19.970
You have a weakness-- water.

01:13:20.100 --> 01:13:23.020
It's like your kryptonite.

01:13:23.140 --> 01:13:25.440
You hearing me, David?

01:15:40.400 --> 01:15:42.360
Audrey?

01:16:15.810 --> 01:16:18.190
Gotcha. Come on.

01:16:35.830 --> 01:16:38.670
Audrey. Audrey.

01:16:44.550 --> 01:16:46.510
Hey!

01:16:50.640 --> 01:16:53.480
You'll be okay.

01:16:53.600 --> 01:16:57.360
What-- What happened?

01:16:57.480 --> 01:17:01.400
I thought I was--
I thought I was dead.

01:17:01.480 --> 01:17:03.440
Me too.

01:17:07.950 --> 01:17:09.910
Is she all right?

01:17:10.030 --> 01:17:12.330
I think her leg's broken.

01:17:12.450 --> 01:17:15.000
Are you hurt?

01:17:15.080 --> 01:17:17.290
Hey, man, are you hurt?

01:17:47.740 --> 01:17:49.700
Hello.

01:17:49.820 --> 01:17:52.580
I wasn't injured in that caraccident.

01:17:52.660 --> 01:17:55.290
David.

01:17:55.370 --> 01:17:57.920
I've never been injured, Eliijah.

01:18:00.250 --> 01:18:02.550
What am I supposed to do?

01:18:08.510 --> 01:18:11.350
Go to where people are.

01:18:11.470 --> 01:18:14.470
You won't have to look very long.

01:18:16.100 --> 01:18:19.020
It's all right to be afraid, David...

01:18:19.150 --> 01:18:23.190
because this part won't be
like a comic book.

01:18:23.270 --> 01:18:28.150
Real life doesn't fit into little boxes
that were drawn for it.

01:19:06.480 --> 01:19:10.410
There's one in the first row.
It's-- It's the second one.

01:19:10.530 --> 01:19:13.370
Yes. It's the second one over.

01:19:46.570 --> 01:19:48.690
Go back to Africa!

01:20:05.040 --> 01:20:07.250
Hey, what's your name?

01:20:12.930 --> 01:20:15.140
I think you drank too much.

01:21:00.770 --> 01:21:02.810
Can I come in?

01:21:02.890 --> 01:21:05.440
Who are you?

01:21:05.520 --> 01:21:08.270
I like your house.

01:21:08.400 --> 01:21:10.360
Can I come in?

01:21:10.480 --> 01:21:12.690
What is this?

01:21:14.360 --> 01:21:17.620
No, you can't come in.

01:21:17.740 --> 01:21:20.200
Are you sure?

01:21:20.280 --> 01:21:22.580
What are-- What are you--

01:25:52.770 --> 01:25:54.730
It's okay.

01:26:05.110 --> 01:26:07.070
It's okay. It's okay.

01:32:50.810 --> 01:32:53.350
I had a bad dream.

01:32:59.280 --> 01:33:01.400
It's over now.

01:33:29.430 --> 01:33:32.270
I don't know.

01:33:32.350 --> 01:33:34.390
I can't believe you'd think that.

01:33:34.520 --> 01:33:36.480
I'm just asking you.

01:33:39.770 --> 01:33:41.980
I'm making French toast.

01:33:57.420 --> 01:33:59.960
I've been thinking about Elijah Price.

01:34:01.300 --> 01:34:05.050
If he shows up again, I think
we should call the police, okay?

01:34:09.180 --> 01:34:11.140
Okay?

01:34:13.680 --> 01:34:15.640
Okay.

01:35:23.800 --> 01:35:25.840
You were right.

01:36:15.470 --> 01:36:19.520
This is one of Johann Davis'
earliest drawings.

01:36:19.640 --> 01:36:22.020
See the villain's eyes?

01:36:22.100 --> 01:36:24.310
They're larger than
the other characters'.

01:36:24.440 --> 01:36:29.940
They insinuate a slightly skewed
perspective on how they see the world--

01:36:31.070 --> 01:36:33.360
just off normal.

01:36:33.450 --> 01:36:35.740
He doesn't look scary.

01:36:35.870 --> 01:36:38.330
Mm-hmm. That's what I said to my son.

01:36:38.450 --> 01:36:41.120
But he says there's always two kinds.

01:36:41.210 --> 01:36:45.590
There's the soldier villain
who fights the hero with his hands...

01:36:45.710 --> 01:36:50.010
and then there's the real threat--
the brilliant and evil archenemy...

01:36:50.090 --> 01:36:52.550
who fights the hero with his mind.

01:36:52.680 --> 01:36:54.640
Are you Elijah's mother?

01:36:54.760 --> 01:36:58.510
I am. I'm helping him with the sale.

01:36:58.600 --> 01:37:01.350
Nice to meet you. I'm David Dunn.

01:37:01.480 --> 01:37:03.440
He's spoken ofyou.

01:37:03.560 --> 01:37:05.520
Says you're becoming friends.

01:37:05.650 --> 01:37:08.020
We are.

01:37:08.150 --> 01:37:10.360
Looks like he's doing good today.

01:37:11.490 --> 01:37:14.410
I'm very proud of him.

01:37:14.490 --> 01:37:17.580
He's come through a lot in his life--

01:37:17.660 --> 01:37:21.160
a couple of bad spills
I thought had broken him.

01:37:21.290 --> 01:37:24.370
Mm-hmm. They were bad...

01:37:25.540 --> 01:37:28.090
but he made it.

01:37:28.170 --> 01:37:30.130
Yes, he did.

01:37:31.300 --> 01:37:33.510
He's kind of a miracle.

01:37:35.680 --> 01:37:37.640
Yes, he is.

01:37:41.220 --> 01:37:43.890
- I'll tell him you're here.
- Thank you.

01:37:45.230 --> 01:37:48.980
We'll work something out.
Always able to work something out.

01:38:14.050 --> 01:38:16.010
It has begun.

01:38:19.180 --> 01:38:21.310
Tell me something, David.

01:38:22.430 --> 01:38:26.980
When you woke up this morning,
was it still there?

01:38:27.060 --> 01:38:29.900
The sadness?

01:38:30.020 --> 01:38:31.980
No.

01:38:35.610 --> 01:38:38.610
I think this is where we shake hands.

01:38:57.680 --> 01:39:00.680
- Look!
- Did you see it?

01:39:10.100 --> 01:39:12.570
I worked in that building 25 years.

01:39:12.690 --> 01:39:14.820
I know all its secrets.

01:39:16.280 --> 01:39:18.240
Secrets?

01:39:19.700 --> 01:39:24.580
Like if there ever was a fire
on floors one, two or three...

01:39:24.700 --> 01:39:28.210
everyone in that hotel
would be burned alive.

01:39:34.170 --> 01:39:36.920
Passengers aren't allowed in there.

01:40:20.220 --> 01:40:22.680
Do you know what
the scariest thing is?

01:40:26.390 --> 01:40:29.640
To not know your place
in this world...

01:40:29.770 --> 01:40:32.310
to not know why you're here.

01:40:33.600 --> 01:40:35.570
That's--

01:40:37.440 --> 01:40:39.820
That's just an awful feeling.

01:40:41.240 --> 01:40:43.530
What have you done?

01:40:44.740 --> 01:40:47.740
I almost gave up hope.

01:40:47.870 --> 01:40:51.040
There were so many times
I questioned myself.

01:40:51.160 --> 01:40:53.710
You killed all those people.

01:40:55.000 --> 01:40:57.840
But I found you.

01:40:57.920 --> 01:41:01.170
So many sacrifiices...

01:41:02.340 --> 01:41:04.300
just to find you.

01:41:04.430 --> 01:41:06.390
Jesus Christ!

01:41:16.310 --> 01:41:19.070
Now that we know who you are...

01:41:20.230 --> 01:41:22.950
I know who I am.

01:41:26.530 --> 01:41:28.740
I'm not a mistake.

01:41:30.240 --> 01:41:32.370
It all makes sense.

01:41:32.500 --> 01:41:37.040
In a comic, you know how you can tell
who the arch-villain's going to be?

01:41:37.170 --> 01:41:40.510
He's the exact opposite of the hero.

01:41:40.630 --> 01:41:44.380
And most times, they're friends,
like you and me.

01:41:44.470 --> 01:41:48.300
I should've known way back when.
You know why, David?

01:41:48.390 --> 01:41:50.350
Because of the kids.

01:42:00.320 --> 01:42:02.990
They called me Mr. Glass.

01:42:03.305 --> 01:42:09.231
