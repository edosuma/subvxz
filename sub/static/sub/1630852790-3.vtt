15:50.260 --> 15:51.730
Come quickly.

15:54.370 --> 15:55.470
Nice.

15:55.470 --> 15:56.700
Go Seung Tak.

15:56.700 --> 15:58.370
Come here quickly.

16:00.840 --> 16:02.110
Fine, I get it.

16:02.110 --> 16:03.840
I'll arrive in a second.

16:04.840 --> 16:07.750
What an annoying person!

16:08.980 --> 16:11.180
Good. If you want to make it public,

16:11.180 --> 16:12.750
let's make it public.

16:21.660 --> 16:23.560
That young man isn't a person

16:24.400 --> 16:28.030
who would refuse to admit his own mistakes.

16:28.030 --> 16:34.610
Please trust me this time.

16:35.570 --> 16:37.740
I'll watch you for a period

16:37.740 --> 16:39.840
but not too long,

16:39.840 --> 16:41.480
Go Seung Tak.

16:51.220 --> 16:55.230
After the operation, Professor Cha said he would go out

16:55.230 --> 16:56.860
and then left.

16:57.630 --> 16:59.330
I'll be back soon.

16:59.330 --> 17:00.630
Stay with the patient.

17:00.630 --> 17:02.730
Call me if anything happens.

17:04.400 --> 17:07.069
Don't you know why he went out and where he went?

17:07.069 --> 17:08.839
He didn't tell me.

17:08.839 --> 17:12.940
It seemed that he got an emergency text.

17:12.940 --> 17:15.480
What was so urgent that he left his patient?

17:15.480 --> 17:17.250
No common sense.

17:17.250 --> 17:19.250
Hippocrates.

17:21.619 --> 17:23.450
When observing the patient's condition,

17:23.450 --> 17:24.890
I found that his heart rate elevated

17:24.890 --> 17:27.359
and then called the professor.

17:27.359 --> 17:29.160
He asked me to send him the patient's data.

17:29.160 --> 17:32.130
The examination results suggested a crack in the surgical site.

17:32.130 --> 17:34.070
So I dialed his number immediately but he didn't answer.

17:34.070 --> 17:38.170
Maybe he was already hit at that time.

17:46.310 --> 17:48.250
That's why I decided to do the emergency surgery.

17:48.250 --> 17:48.810
What else could I do?

17:48.810 --> 17:50.350
The patient was dying.

17:50.350 --> 17:52.050
As the chief, of course I should come forward.

17:52.050 --> 17:52.980
What's wrong?

17:52.980 --> 17:54.320
Where's Professor Cha? Isn't he coming?

17:54.320 --> 17:56.350
Right, he said he was far from the hospital.

17:56.350 --> 17:58.320
Excuse! He did it to evade the responsibility.

17:58.320 --> 17:59.660
So he left.

17:59.660 --> 18:01.890
Then, could you do it, chief?

18:01.890 --> 18:03.390
Why should I be the scapegoat?

18:03.390 --> 18:04.130
President Jang

18:04.130 --> 18:05.500
is Professor Cha's patient.

18:05.500 --> 18:07.160
Either wait till Professor Cha is back

18:07.160 --> 18:08.900
or keep calling other doctors.

18:08.900 --> 18:10.170
I see.

18:10.170 --> 18:11.200
Listen up.

18:11.200 --> 18:13.840
If anything happens to President Jang,
Professor Cha takes full responsibility.

18:13.840 --> 18:15.270
Are you clear?

18:17.270 --> 18:19.110
But Dr. Gim Jae Won wanted to do an LPTT

18:19.110 --> 18:21.750
just in case.

18:24.820 --> 18:25.950
An LPTT.

18:25.950 --> 18:27.180
It's very urgent. Please be quick.

18:27.180 --> 18:29.020
But the sample turned out to be uncheckable,

18:28.020 --> 18:32.490
[Uncheckable
The value is too high or too low, beyond the detection range]

18:29.020 --> 18:31.360
which suggested an overdose of heparin.

18:36.060 --> 18:38.660
Why did you want to do that test?

18:39.560 --> 18:42.900
Because Dr. An Tae Hyeon gave me an instruction before.

18:42.900 --> 18:44.540
What instruction?

18:45.870 --> 18:50.240
I asked him to rise heparin to 1,000.

18:56.080 --> 18:57.620
So why?

18:57.620 --> 19:00.150
I said clearly 500.

19:02.520 --> 19:04.960
I must have told you

19:05.590 --> 19:09.060
to add heparin to 1,000,

19:10.390 --> 19:11.560
didn't I?

19:11.560 --> 19:12.330
Shoot!

19:12.330 --> 19:16.070
Or did I say 5,000?

19:16.070 --> 19:18.100
I happen to be curious, too.

19:18.100 --> 19:19.470
Was that Professor Cha's instruction?

19:19.470 --> 19:20.440
What?

19:20.440 --> 19:23.470
Dr. An Tae Hyeon said it was Professor Cha's instruction.

19:23.470 --> 19:25.680
He let me add to 5,000 but the surgery wasn't done yet.

19:25.680 --> 19:26.980
I also found it strange.

19:26.980 --> 19:28.110
Well, now…

19:28.110 --> 19:28.980
Hey, Go Seung Tak.

19:28.980 --> 19:30.110
So,

19:30.110 --> 19:33.180
Dr. Gim Jae won, did you inject heparin for the patient?

19:33.180 --> 19:34.850
If you did, how much?

19:36.120 --> 19:37.590
Well…

19:38.290 --> 19:39.490
I didn't do it.

19:39.490 --> 19:42.430
If not you, who?

19:54.810 --> 19:55.940
Seriously?

19:56.570 --> 19:58.340
Why are you being so quiet?

19:58.340 --> 19:59.240
What?

19:59.240 --> 20:01.250
Do you still dare not speak the truth?

20:01.250 --> 20:02.750
I knew it. You coward!

20:02.750 --> 20:04.350
It's me.

20:13.490 --> 20:17.260
Dr. Gim Jae won asked me to do it for him.

20:30.740 --> 20:32.110
Dr. Go Seung Tak,

20:32.110 --> 20:34.610
what exactly did Dr. Gim Jae won tell you?

20:35.210 --> 20:37.150
He asked me to add heparin to 1,000.

20:37.150 --> 20:40.150
So did you inject 1,000?

20:44.720 --> 20:46.320
Dr. Go Seung Tak,

20:46.320 --> 20:48.430
how much heparin did you give the patient?

20:48.430 --> 20:49.990
I didn't do the injection.

20:49.990 --> 20:51.730
Not even a milliliter.

20:58.270 --> 21:00.540
I knew you would say that.

21:00.540 --> 21:02.510
How could I trust a guy like you?

21:02.510 --> 21:04.480
I'm telling the truth.

21:04.480 --> 21:08.380
I did nothing to patient Jang Gwang Deok.

21:08.380 --> 21:09.750
Never.

21:11.320 --> 21:13.120
How can you prove what you just said?

21:13.120 --> 21:14.290
Is there any evidence?

21:14.290 --> 21:17.050
There can't be evidence for a thing I didn't do.

21:17.920 --> 21:21.160
But there should be a witness.

21:31.840 --> 21:33.740
Dr. Go Seung Tak checked on

21:33.740 --> 21:36.440
patient Jang Gwang Deok after he came in.

21:50.850 --> 21:52.720
Let me take a look at the medical record.

21:52.720 --> 21:54.060
Alright.

21:55.560 --> 21:56.460
It’s here.

21:56.460 --> 21:59.100
Based on the medical record, the patient has been injected with heparin at 500 ml an hour

21:59.100 --> 22:03.100
round the clock according to Professor Cha Yeong Min’s instructions.

22:03.100 --> 22:04.470
The patient suffered from a cerebral hemorrhage

22:04.470 --> 22:05.700
and cardiac tumor.

22:05.700 --> 22:08.470
The tumor had been removed during the surgery.

22:08.470 --> 22:10.010
In case it wasn’t completely removed

22:10.010 --> 22:13.980
and to avoid tumor cells traveling through the lungs and neck

22:13.980 --> 22:16.380
to the brain,

22:16.380 --> 22:17.820
we did a heparin injection after making sure that there wasn’t any

22:17.820 --> 22:19.850
postoperative bleeding.

22:25.060 --> 22:25.960
Gosh.

22:25.960 --> 22:27.660
You don’t deserve to be called a doctor.

22:27.660 --> 22:30.630
I thought you’d at least learned something before you could be qualified to sit there.

22:33.600 --> 22:35.100
So simply put,

22:35.100 --> 22:37.530
heparin injection was performed to prevent the remaining tumor cells

22:37.530 --> 22:39.440
from traveling through this side up here

22:39.440 --> 22:42.710
and clogging blood vessels in the brain.

22:42.710 --> 22:44.540
By the way, you know what heparin is, don’t you?

22:44.540 --> 22:46.140
It’s used to prevent blood clotting.

22:46.140 --> 22:48.010
Oh, yeah.

22:48.010 --> 22:49.150
But the thing is

22:49.150 --> 22:51.050
that if you inject too much heparin, it could cause vascular rupture.

22:51.050 --> 22:52.320
And then what will happen?

22:52.320 --> 22:55.050
The surgical wound could open.

22:58.290 --> 23:01.160
On the medical record, it said that atrial fibrillation occurred once after surgery.

23:01.160 --> 23:05.000
To minimize the risk of the recurrence of cerebral hemorrhage,

23:05.000 --> 23:08.970
Professor Cha prescribed no more than 500 ml of heparin.

23:08.970 --> 23:10.570
When I checked on the patient, he was stable

23:10.570 --> 23:12.240
and had no abnormal symptoms.

23:12.240 --> 23:14.770
If you increase the dose under such circumstances,

23:14.770 --> 23:16.370
it’s no different from killing the patient.

23:16.370 --> 23:20.140
That’s exactly what I thought!

23:23.780 --> 23:26.150
No need to increase the dose of heparin.

23:26.150 --> 23:29.250
If anyone asks, tell him it’s my instruction.

23:29.250 --> 23:30.920
Then I’m leaving.

23:31.760 --> 23:33.660
[Intensive Care Unit]

23:36.490 --> 23:38.260
After saying that he left

23:38.260 --> 23:40.460
and never came back again.

24:25.710 --> 24:29.480
I feel like I was being set up.

24:29.480 --> 24:32.350
Could you tell me what’s going on?

24:33.350 --> 24:35.120
So who the heck increased the dose of heparin?

24:35.120 --> 24:37.450
There’s no way to find out.

24:38.020 --> 24:41.060
We don’t have a camera, so we can’t make a baseless accusation.

24:41.060 --> 24:42.890
It’s said the Legal Department will run an investigation.

24:42.890 --> 24:44.560
They will find out the truth soon.

24:44.560 --> 24:45.860
Don’t worry too much.

24:45.860 --> 24:48.570
As long as you know that I was still on your side in that situation.

24:48.570 --> 24:51.070
Of course, Chief, we know that.

24:51.070 --> 24:52.770
We are thankful to you.

24:52.770 --> 24:55.070
The professors weren’t in the hospital at that time.

24:55.070 --> 24:57.240
You said you were somewhere far away.

24:57.240 --> 24:58.880
You said you got acute enteritis.

24:58.880 --> 25:02.150
You said your wife’s family had a funeral. Did you go for mourning?

25:02.150 --> 25:04.250
After President Jang learned this matter,

25:04.250 --> 25:07.920
only Chief Ban and my team members were involved in the treatment.

25:08.550 --> 25:11.260
But how come Professor Cha wasn’t in the hospital at that time?

25:11.260 --> 25:12.860
He caused such a mess.

25:12.860 --> 25:14.930
I know he didn’t do it on purpose and I shouldn’t have blamed him,

25:14.930 --> 25:17.090
but he does lack a sense of responsibility.

25:17.090 --> 25:19.260
Chief Ban Tae Sik would do whatever

25:19.260 --> 25:22.570
Han Seung Won asks him to do in order to take me down.

25:23.330 --> 25:25.200
No, wait.

25:25.200 --> 25:28.340
But evil as he is, he wouldn’t risk someone’s life.

25:28.340 --> 25:29.970
Darn it!

25:37.480 --> 25:39.020
Gim Jae Won.

25:39.020 --> 25:39.980
He believes everything the professors say

25:39.980 --> 25:43.350
even if they told him he could treat a brain tumor with aspirin.

25:44.220 --> 25:47.420
How did such a dumbhead become a doctor?

25:47.960 --> 25:49.830
But he’s indeed a kind person.

25:49.830 --> 25:50.930
He wouldn’t even walk under a pine tree

25:50.930 --> 25:52.200
because he doesn’t want to kill a pine moth by accident.

25:52.200 --> 25:53.960
How could he do such a thing to a patient?

25:53.960 --> 25:55.730
No. No way.

25:56.470 --> 25:59.900
Sunbae, during the meeting…

25:59.900 --> 26:02.540
Didn’t you sign the Confidentiality Agreement?

26:02.540 --> 26:04.140
It’s none of our concern anymore.

26:04.140 --> 26:06.340
Why don’t you read a medical paper if you have time?

26:06.940 --> 26:08.950
This Lee Seon Ho guy.

26:08.950 --> 26:10.780
He could become an excellent doctor one day.

26:10.780 --> 26:13.350
It’s obvious that he’s selfish and self-absorbed.

26:14.050 --> 26:16.990
Would a person like that stain his career?

26:16.990 --> 26:18.790
No way.

26:20.190 --> 26:22.830
I feel so bored as if I ate 100 yams.

26:22.830 --> 26:26.230
A statement like that would make people think you are even worse than a first-year newbie.

26:27.030 --> 26:28.730
Didn’t you see?

26:28.730 --> 26:30.930
I think even one with four years of experience can’t compare to Go Seung Tak.

26:30.930 --> 26:32.470
What did you say?

26:38.610 --> 26:40.580
Iced Americano.

26:40.580 --> 26:42.450
You asked for hot, right?

26:44.280 --> 26:46.380
I told you that I’d double the coffee.

26:46.380 --> 26:49.950
And by double, this is what I meant.

26:49.950 --> 26:52.720
This is a bribe to make up for being late, isn’t it?

26:52.720 --> 26:55.660
Hey, Crystal, don’t you get it yet?

26:55.660 --> 26:59.560
I’m not the punctual type.

27:00.860 --> 27:02.670
Guys, enjoy.

27:04.230 --> 27:11.340
True. He’s just a rude and inconsiderate klutz

27:12.010 --> 27:15.250
who’s only good at theory.

27:23.120 --> 27:25.020
Darn it.

27:25.920 --> 27:28.160
Then who is it?

27:28.930 --> 27:31.730
Could it be An Tae Hyeon?

27:31.730 --> 27:33.100
Female patient, 69 years old.

27:33.100 --> 27:35.400
She had the CABG during Post-MI treatment.

27:35.400 --> 27:36.930
She suffered from a ventricular septal defect.

27:36.930 --> 27:38.300
Four days ago she was implanted with artificial lungs.

27:38.300 --> 27:39.570
Two days ago she was extubated

27:39.570 --> 27:41.100
and started breathing on her own.

27:41.770 --> 27:42.910
The ejection fraction is 30%.

27:42.910 --> 27:43.940
Her condition is stable.

27:44.270 --> 27:44.810
Oh, yeah?

27:45.110 --> 27:47.880
Then inject anticoagulant regularly.

27:48.080 --> 27:51.550
Switch to LMWH for tedelparin.

27:54.280 --> 27:56.090
She’s a patient to whom Professor Cha has been paying close attention.

27:57.150 --> 27:58.420
Keep an eye on her.

27:59.020 --> 28:00.060
Okay.

28:08.470 --> 28:12.300
This patient was operated on by Dr. An at last, right?

28:12.900 --> 28:14.170
An ECG shall be done every day.

28:14.400 --> 28:16.740
Start 24-hour ECG recording after she moves to the ward.

28:17.070 --> 28:17.940
Since Professor had an accident,

28:17.940 --> 28:20.640
the operation was two days later than scheduled.

28:20.640 --> 28:22.150
Tell her it wasn’t the professor’s fault.

28:22.150 --> 28:23.580
Take good care of her till the end.

28:23.580 --> 28:26.080
Okay. Got it.

28:28.220 --> 28:31.620
I must have gone crazy.

28:31.620 --> 28:34.930
How could I doubt my men?

28:43.370 --> 28:45.470
Sunbae.

28:46.600 --> 28:50.110
Professor Cha…

28:50.110 --> 28:53.240
Is there anything we can do?

28:54.540 --> 28:57.880
The Neurosurgery Department will take care of him.

28:57.880 --> 28:59.220
Don’t you know his condition?

28:59.220 --> 29:00.720
Since the clinical death has been announced,
