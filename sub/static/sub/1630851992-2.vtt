00:01.001 --> 00:03.003
(THEME MUSIC PLAYING)

00:32.783 --> 00:34.076
Tell me what you feel.

00:42.251 --> 00:44.211
I just feel you.

00:51.718 --> 00:53.637
STARK: Jarvis, you up?
JARVIS: For you, sir, always.

00:53.762 --> 00:55.722
A little ostentatious, don't you think?

00:55.806 --> 00:57.808
JARVIS: What was I thinking?
You're usually so discreet.

00:59.309 --> 01:00.853
Throw a little hot-rod red in there.

01:00.936 --> 01:02.771
JARVIS: Yes, that should help
keep a low profile.

01:07.526 --> 01:08.819
-Jarvis.
-JARVIS: Doctor.

01:09.069 --> 01:11.947
Started out, Jarvis was just
a natural language UI.

01:12.030 --> 01:14.950
Now he runs more of the business
than anyone besides Pepper.

01:15.033 --> 01:16.118
Top of the line.

01:16.201 --> 01:17.661
Deploy! Deploy!

01:20.706 --> 01:22.124
JARVIS: Please, try not to move, sir.

01:28.088 --> 01:30.424
JARVIS: Sir, we have more incoming.

01:30.507 --> 01:32.134
STARK: Jarvis, find me a soft spot.

01:36.638 --> 01:38.765
Threat is imminent.

01:38.849 --> 01:41.268
I see a suit of armor around the world.

01:41.351 --> 01:42.978
If we can harness this power,

01:43.061 --> 01:44.771
this could be the key
to creating Ultron.

01:44.855 --> 01:46.690
BANNER: So you're going
for artificial intelligence,

01:46.773 --> 01:48.275
and you don't wanna tell the team?

01:48.609 --> 01:50.944
JARVIS: I am Jarvis. You are Ultron.

01:51.028 --> 01:54.072
I am unable to access the mainframe.
What are you trying to...

01:54.156 --> 01:55.532
ULTRON: We're having a nice talk.

01:55.616 --> 01:57.451
I'm a peacekeeping program...

01:57.534 --> 01:59.995
JARVIS: I believe
your intentions to be hostile.

02:02.706 --> 02:05.250
I... I... I think
I may be malfunctioning, sir.

02:06.293 --> 02:08.462
BANNER: Ultron's going to evolve.

02:08.629 --> 02:09.671
ULTRON: This...

02:12.758 --> 02:14.176
is the next me.

02:15.719 --> 02:17.888
When they see my vision,

02:18.931 --> 02:20.390
they'll understand.

02:22.684 --> 02:23.769
ROMANOFF: We have an ally?

02:23.852 --> 02:26.647
FURY: Ultron's got an enemy.
That's not the same thing.

02:26.939 --> 02:27.940
I found him.

02:29.525 --> 02:32.277
Ultron didn't go after Jarvis
because he was angry.

02:32.361 --> 02:34.279
He attacked him because he was scared

02:34.363 --> 02:35.405
of what he can do.

02:40.202 --> 02:41.537
THOR: I've had a vision.

02:41.620 --> 02:44.373
A whirlpool that sucks in
all hope of life,and at its center...

02:44.456 --> 02:45.499
The Mind Stone.

02:45.582 --> 02:47.376
The Avengers cannot defeat Ultron.

02:47.459 --> 02:48.460
Not alone.

02:48.544 --> 02:50.212
ROGERS: Why does your Vision
sound like Jarvis?

02:50.295 --> 02:52.631
STARK: We configured Jarvis's matrix
to create something new.

02:52.714 --> 02:55.092
I'm not what you are
and not what you intended.

02:55.175 --> 02:57.344
So, there may be no way
to make you trust me.

02:57.886 --> 02:58.929
But we need to go.

03:02.224 --> 03:04.059
STARK: I get first crack at the big guy.

03:04.142 --> 03:05.811
Iron Man's the one he's waiting for.

03:05.894 --> 03:07.771
That's true. He hates you the most.

03:09.648 --> 03:11.483
ULTRON: This is how you end.

03:12.067 --> 03:14.653
All of you against all of me.

03:15.654 --> 03:17.072
VISION: He must be destroyed.

03:17.948 --> 03:22.494
And not one of us
can do it without the other.

03:26.665 --> 03:28.292
ULTRON: Do you see...

03:28.375 --> 03:29.459
the beauty of it?

03:30.502 --> 03:32.129
The inevitability.

03:33.297 --> 03:34.590
WANDA: Is that paprikash?

03:34.673 --> 03:37.384
VISION: I thought
it might lift your spirits.

03:37.467 --> 03:39.261
Spirits lifted.

03:40.596 --> 03:42.931
Vis! We talked about this.

03:43.015 --> 03:45.267
Yes, but the door was open
so I assumed that...

03:46.685 --> 03:47.853
WANDA: The Stone...

03:47.936 --> 03:50.063
Are you afraid of it?

03:50.147 --> 03:53.317
It's a involuntary response
in their amygdala.

03:53.400 --> 03:55.110
They can't help but be afraid.

03:55.194 --> 03:57.154
My amygdala is synthetic, so...

03:57.237 --> 03:58.447
(LAUGHS)

04:00.657 --> 04:02.492
VISION: I wish to understand it.

04:02.576 --> 04:04.494
The more I do, the less it controls me.

04:04.578 --> 04:06.496
One day...
I may even control it.

04:08.540 --> 04:11.210
Our very strength invites challenge.

04:12.753 --> 04:14.922
Challenge incites conflict.

04:16.173 --> 04:19.009
Conflict breeds catastrophe.

04:32.189 --> 04:34.316
VISION: You believe
what you're doing is right.

04:34.399 --> 04:37.110
For the collective good,
surrender now.

04:40.030 --> 04:43.408
STARK: Vision turned off his transponder.
He's offline.

04:47.913 --> 04:49.289
VISION: ...as if it's speaking to me.

04:49.373 --> 04:50.582
WANDA: What does it say?

04:51.583 --> 04:53.252
What are they?

04:53.335 --> 04:55.254
What the Stone was warning me about.

04:58.298 --> 04:59.591
I have to go.

04:59.675 --> 05:01.134
Vision...

05:01.218 --> 05:03.720
-Wanda. (SCREAMS)
-Vision!

05:03.804 --> 05:07.683
Give up the Stone
and she lives.

05:07.766 --> 05:08.767
(GRUNTS)

05:17.568 --> 05:20.529
VISION: I've been giving a good deal
of thought to this entity in my head,

05:20.612 --> 05:21.613
about its nature.

05:21.697 --> 05:23.532
We have to destroy it.

05:23.615 --> 05:27.619
BANNER: Your mind is made up of
a complex construct of overlays.

05:28.328 --> 05:31.540
Jarvis, Ultron, Tony...

05:32.416 --> 05:35.210
If we take out the Stone,
there's a whole lot of Vision left.

05:35.294 --> 05:36.962
Perhaps the best parts.

05:37.963 --> 05:41.508
Evacuate the city, engage all defenses
and get this man a shield.

05:46.138 --> 05:48.056
VISION: We are out of time.

05:49.725 --> 05:51.894
They can't stop him, Wanda.
But we can.

05:52.728 --> 05:53.729
It's not fair.

05:56.023 --> 05:57.357
It shouldn't be you, but it is.

06:22.758 --> 06:24.051
VISION: Humans are odd.

06:24.760 --> 06:28.555
They think order and chaos
are somehow opposites

06:29.223 --> 06:30.933
and try to control what won't be.

06:32.851 --> 06:35.979
But a thing isn't beautiful
because it lasts.
