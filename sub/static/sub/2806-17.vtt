00:06.089 --> 00:11.343
The caterer sent me this list of 12
appetizers. I have to narrow it to six.

00:11.553 --> 00:13.679
Food? Oh, give me.

00:13.888 --> 00:19.184
So did Monica tell you we're trying to get
The Swing Kings to play the wedding?

00:19.394 --> 00:21.020
Since when are you into swing music?

00:21.229 --> 00:24.857
Since forever. I used to go all over town
listening to bands.

00:25.066 --> 00:28.402
- Chandler.
- Gap commercial.

00:30.321 --> 00:33.866
- So did you book them? Did you call?
- I will.

00:34.117 --> 00:38.370
- You want me to call?
- No. I'll do it. You stick to your job.

00:38.580 --> 00:41.540
- What is your job?
- Staying out of the way.

00:42.625 --> 00:46.587
This is impossible.
Why don't you just pick all 15?

00:46.838 --> 00:50.424
- There were only 12.
- Oh, yeah, I added three.

00:50.633 --> 00:53.260
What are "peanut-butter fingers"?

01:43.478 --> 01:45.646
Well, hello.

01:45.855 --> 01:47.648
She's cute.

01:47.857 --> 01:50.025
Should we go try to talk to her?

01:50.276 --> 01:55.447
Sure. The great thing about being engaged,
I'm not nervous to talk to pretty girls anymore.

01:55.657 --> 01:57.574
Could you guys help me?

02:00.578 --> 02:02.913
Yeah, let me get that for you.

02:03.123 --> 02:06.959
- It's really heavy.
- I got it.

02:07.377 --> 02:08.627
Oh!

02:10.170 --> 02:14.800
So hi, I'm Ross,
and this is my friend, Chandler.

02:17.137 --> 02:18.762
I'm Kristen.

02:18.972 --> 02:21.390
Kristen. Hi. Are you new to the area?

02:21.641 --> 02:24.643
Because if you are,
I'd love to show you around sometime.

02:24.853 --> 02:28.355
- I actually just moved from four blocks over.
- Oh.

02:28.565 --> 02:31.108
But this block is like a whole other world.

02:31.359 --> 02:35.320
Actually, it does have
a very interesting history.

02:35.572 --> 02:40.993
This street is the first street in the city
to have an underground sewer system.

02:41.953 --> 02:44.329
Before that, sewage and waste...

02:44.581 --> 02:47.791
...would just flow
right down the street. Yeah.

02:48.001 --> 02:50.669
Sometimes ankle-deep.

02:51.796 --> 02:53.380
Smooth.

02:55.091 --> 02:56.717
Excuse me?

02:59.637 --> 03:05.017
You're gonna be starving after moving.
What do you say I take you to dinner tonight?

03:05.226 --> 03:06.977
- I'd like that.
- Yeah? Great.

03:07.187 --> 03:08.437
Let me take this up.

03:08.646 --> 03:11.940
- After you.
- Oh, no. After you.

03:13.651 --> 03:15.485
Oh, my God!

03:23.494 --> 03:26.747
Am I crazy, or does this totally go?

03:28.208 --> 03:32.419
Oh, my God! You look so beautiful!

03:32.629 --> 03:35.923
Thank you, Rachel.
But look at Monica!

03:36.925 --> 03:40.093
This is it. Yeah, this is the one.

03:40.345 --> 03:42.596
I can't believe I found it.

03:42.847 --> 03:47.476
Wow, you look so beautiful.
If I knew you, I'd cry.

03:47.852 --> 03:51.146
I'm Monica Geller. Ball like a baby.

03:51.356 --> 03:52.731
I'm Megan Bailey.

03:52.941 --> 03:56.610
- Have you found your dress yet?
- No. These dresses are all so amazing...

03:56.861 --> 04:00.447
...but I couldn't afford one.
- No, I can't afford this either.

04:00.698 --> 04:05.535
I'm here to figure out the one I want,
then I'll get it at Kleinman's, this discount place.

04:05.787 --> 04:07.955
Day after tomorrow,
they're having a huge sale.

04:08.164 --> 04:11.500
- Thanks for the tip.
- When are you getting married?

04:11.751 --> 04:16.797
- I'm not. I just like to try these on.
- I do the same thing.

04:17.632 --> 04:21.510
I'm just kidding.
I'm getting married July 25th.

04:22.303 --> 04:24.554
I'm just kidding too. Ha, ha.

04:24.806 --> 04:27.432
I'm getting married in December.

04:29.269 --> 04:31.895
- When are you getting married?
- May 15th.

04:32.146 --> 04:34.731
Ooh. It's close.
So who's your photographer?

04:34.983 --> 04:36.733
- Jeffrey.
- We met with him.

04:36.985 --> 04:42.030
- Did he show you nude wedding photos?
- Best Man? Wow!

04:42.448 --> 04:45.325
I know. I almost called off
my wedding. Heh, heh, heh.

04:45.493 --> 04:49.204
- Oh, who's your band?
- My fiancé wants The Swing Kings.

04:49.414 --> 04:53.542
You're lucky. My fiancé wants
the heavy metal band, Carcass.

04:53.751 --> 04:58.672
Is that spelled with a "C" or a "K"?
Oh, my God, it doesn't matter, they're both great!

05:00.466 --> 05:02.509
Oh, you know what? Don't buy that here.

05:02.719 --> 05:06.346
Now that you know what you want,
go to Kleinman's. Get it half off.

05:06.597 --> 05:08.724
This place is so over-priced.

05:08.933 --> 05:10.851
I own this store.

05:12.520 --> 05:16.023
So does this come
in another color, or...

05:25.575 --> 05:28.827
Hi. You moving in or moving out?

05:29.037 --> 05:31.038
- Moving in.
- Can I give you a hand?

05:31.247 --> 05:36.126
Okay, but be careful. The guy who was helping
before had to leave because he hurt his back.

05:37.045 --> 05:38.712
- Boyfriend?
- No.

05:38.921 --> 05:40.630
I'm Joey.

05:41.299 --> 05:42.341
Kristen.

05:42.550 --> 05:45.427
Wow. What a beautiful name.

05:46.262 --> 05:48.347
What is it again?

05:49.265 --> 05:51.767
- Kristen.
- Ah, that's it. Okay.

05:52.477 --> 05:55.228
- You live around here?
- Yeah. Yeah, right down there.

05:55.480 --> 05:57.314
Let me give you a tip.

05:57.565 --> 06:02.319
Don't take a nap on this stoop.
You could wake up without shoes.

06:03.363 --> 06:04.821
- I'll remember that.
- Okay.

06:05.073 --> 06:09.701
Listen, would you like
to have dinner with me tonight?

06:09.911 --> 06:13.080
I have plans tonight.
How about tomorrow?

06:13.289 --> 06:15.874
Sounds great.
Well, where does this go?

06:16.084 --> 06:18.710
You look strong. I'll take that,
you grab one of the boxes.

06:18.878 --> 06:20.921
Okay. Yeah.

06:24.675 --> 06:26.968
Yeah, I'll get this one.

06:29.889 --> 06:31.765
What's taking so long?

06:34.310 --> 06:36.019
WOMAN 2
Come on.

06:36.771 --> 06:38.814
So this is Brooklyn?

06:39.524 --> 06:43.110
All right, listen up. There's usually only
one dress in each size.

06:43.361 --> 06:46.780
So when they open those doors,
fan out.

06:47.198 --> 06:51.910
This is what you're looking for.
Memorize it.

06:52.829 --> 06:57.249
When you locate the dress
blow on these, all right?

06:58.292 --> 07:01.503
Three sharp blasts.
When you hear it, come running.

07:01.671 --> 07:03.588
Okay, got it.

07:03.840 --> 07:04.881
Here he comes!

07:05.049 --> 07:08.301
- Oh, they're pushing!
- Don't be a baby!

07:08.511 --> 07:11.012
- Out of the way!
- Let's go!

07:11.722 --> 07:14.349
Hey, Rachel! Come on!

07:22.942 --> 07:27.195
No. No, not it. Not it. Not it. Ugh.

07:29.866 --> 07:31.992
Don't crowd me.

07:34.370 --> 07:37.539
This is it! This is the dress!
Oh, my God. It's perfect.

07:37.790 --> 07:39.916
I'm sorry, this one's taken! Whoa!

07:42.044 --> 07:43.879
- Megan!
- Monica!

07:44.130 --> 07:45.755
- You came!
- Yeah!

07:46.007 --> 07:48.717
- This is my dress!
- No!

07:48.968 --> 07:52.888
- Yes, it is. You saw me wearing it.
- And now you'll see me buying it.

07:53.139 --> 07:55.307
You freak!

07:55.683 --> 07:58.310
You wouldn't even know
about this place without me.

07:58.519 --> 08:03.648
- Look, you don't want to fight me.
- Maybe I do. I'm pretty feisty!

08:05.067 --> 08:06.776
- I'm coming! I'm coming!
- Hey!

08:08.196 --> 08:10.113
Okay! Hey.

08:11.449 --> 08:12.991
Oh, what do I do?!

08:19.332 --> 08:23.502
What are you doing?
Did you find the dress?

08:23.794 --> 08:25.170
Did you find the dress?

08:25.379 --> 08:28.173
No. You gotta get me out of here.
These shoppers are crazy.

08:28.341 --> 08:30.467
- We've gotta get Monica.
- You gotta hold my hand!

08:30.635 --> 08:31.801
Oh, my God.

08:33.179 --> 08:35.931
Excuse me! Excuse me!

08:37.683 --> 08:40.184
Go! Go! Go!

08:40.394 --> 08:42.145
- Hey.
- Go!

08:51.906 --> 08:54.241
So, Ross,
how was your date the other night?

08:54.450 --> 08:59.496
Did you tell her about the magical
ride that starts with the flush of every toilet?

09:01.123 --> 09:05.877
Laugh all you want, but she left me a message
saying she'd like to go out again.

09:06.087 --> 09:09.422
- Oh.
- In fact, I'll go call her right now.

09:09.674 --> 09:12.717
And I'll make sure and tell her my
friend Chandler says...

09:17.181 --> 09:18.557
- Hey, Chandler.
- Hey.

09:18.766 --> 09:22.769
Sorry I didn't stop by last night,
but I had a date.

09:22.979 --> 09:27.232
Joe, when it's 1:00 in the morning and you
don't come by? That's okay.

09:27.483 --> 09:32.320
Check it out. It was with this really hot girl
who just moved in right across the street.

09:32.572 --> 09:35.323
- Really? Right across the street?
- Yeah.

09:35.533 --> 09:37.867
- When did you meet her?
- Two days ago.

09:38.077 --> 09:40.662
Excellent!

09:41.664 --> 09:44.249
- You know, Ross met somebody too.
- Oh, yeah?

09:44.458 --> 09:45.792
- Hey.
- How'd it go?

09:46.043 --> 09:48.169
Great. We're going out again Saturday.

09:48.379 --> 09:53.174
But I found out she's
also seeing some other guy.

09:54.844 --> 09:56.928
Really?

09:58.222 --> 10:02.309
Joe, what would you do
if you were in Ross' situation?

10:02.518 --> 10:06.813
Well, I sort of am. I'm dating this girl
who's also seeing another guy.

10:07.064 --> 10:09.190
But I'm not too worried about it.

10:09.400 --> 10:14.654
You shouldn't be. Believe me, I wouldn't want
to be the guy who's up against you.

10:15.948 --> 10:19.159
I mean, that doofus is going to lose.

10:21.203 --> 10:24.080
So this is nice.

10:26.208 --> 10:29.794
I wish I didn't have to go.
Believe me.

10:30.004 --> 10:31.212
But I have to.

10:31.464 --> 10:34.382
By the way, what's the name
of the girl you're dating?

10:34.634 --> 10:37.177
- Kristen Leigh.
- Bye.

10:45.561 --> 10:48.605
Well, obviously, only one of us
can keep dating her.

10:48.814 --> 10:52.484
Obviously. So how do we decide?

10:52.693 --> 10:56.196
Well now,
let's look at this objectively.

10:56.447 --> 10:58.740
I think I should date her.

11:00.534 --> 11:02.035
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

11:02.203 --> 11:05.747
Or I'm the one who dates her.

11:06.123 --> 11:10.585
That's interesting.
But check this out. I date her.

11:11.003 --> 11:13.505
Yeah, I like that. But just to go
in another direction...

11:13.756 --> 11:16.132
Okay. This can go on for a while.

11:16.342 --> 11:19.427
- We should order some food then.
- No, Joey.

11:20.971 --> 11:24.557
Look, why don't we
just let her decide, okay?

11:24.809 --> 11:27.602
We'll each go out with her
one more time.

11:27.853 --> 11:30.438
And we'll see who she likes best.

11:31.524 --> 11:33.817
That sounds fair.

11:34.151 --> 11:37.862
Maybe I'll take her
to that new French restaurant down the street.

11:38.072 --> 11:41.533
Wait a second.
We have to set a spending limit on the date.

11:41.701 --> 11:44.577
I don't have the money to take her
to a fancy place like that.

11:44.787 --> 11:48.665
Well, sorry.
That's what I do on dates.

11:48.874 --> 11:53.461
All right. Well, I guess I'll just have to do
what I do on dates.

11:59.093 --> 12:02.595
- So let's decide on a spending limit.
- Yeah.

12:03.180 --> 12:04.472
Uh...

12:06.350 --> 12:09.060
And a slice...

12:10.479 --> 12:12.439
Six dollars?

12:13.941 --> 12:17.193
- I was thinking more like a hundred.
- Okay.

12:17.445 --> 12:20.196
Can I borrow 94 dollars?

12:26.162 --> 12:27.162
Uh.

12:27.371 --> 12:30.540
I know. Can you hand me a tissue?

12:38.424 --> 12:40.759
You're out of Diet Coke.

12:44.346 --> 12:45.388
Hello?

12:46.265 --> 12:49.559
What? You what?

12:49.810 --> 12:51.603
You listen here, missy!

12:53.981 --> 12:54.981
What?

12:55.191 --> 12:58.651
That was Megan. She booked The Swing Kings
on the day of our wedding...

12:58.819 --> 13:01.404
...and said she'd only
give them back for the dress!

13:03.115 --> 13:06.117
Does that mean Carcass is available?

13:07.620 --> 13:12.248
What am I gonna do? That's the dress!
That is "the" dress!

13:12.917 --> 13:16.294
Chandler wants the band.
What do I do?

13:16.504 --> 13:19.172
- Figure out a way to talk him out of it.
- How?

13:20.591 --> 13:22.759
You're out of toilet paper!

13:31.018 --> 13:32.101
- Hey.
- What's up?

13:32.311 --> 13:35.230
I wanted to wish you good luck
on your date.

13:35.481 --> 13:37.690
- Thanks.
- What time are you meeting?

13:37.942 --> 13:41.069
We have 8:00 reservations
at Grand Merci Bistro.

13:41.278 --> 13:44.614
That's in 20 minutes.
You'd better get dressed.

13:46.075 --> 13:49.619
- I am dressed.
- Oh, well, good.

13:49.870 --> 13:51.871
For me.

13:53.916 --> 13:56.793
What's this?
Did you give yourself a facial?

13:57.002 --> 13:59.587
I have an oily T-zone.

14:00.631 --> 14:02.715
Okay, dude.

14:05.719 --> 14:08.596
- Hey, you sent Kristen flowers?
- That's right.

14:09.181 --> 14:13.643
You spent 100 dollars.
That's the limit. You're screwed!

14:14.478 --> 14:19.482
Actually, I sent the flowers before
the actual date, so technically...

14:19.650 --> 14:24.028
...technically, I didn't break any rules.
Thanks for stopping by though.

14:24.238 --> 14:27.657
That's how it's gonna be?
I can break the rules too.

14:27.867 --> 14:30.410
- What are you gonna do?
- I don't know.

14:30.661 --> 14:33.663
- I'm not surprised.
- You won't get away with this.

14:33.873 --> 14:35.540
- You don't have much choice.
- We'll see!

14:35.708 --> 14:37.041
- Bye-bye.
- Yeah, bye-bye.

14:39.712 --> 14:41.963
Hey! So just a light layer?

14:42.172 --> 14:44.841
Yeah, just here and there.

14:51.265 --> 14:55.059
Joey got meat sauce
on the banister again.

14:56.395 --> 14:58.271
Swing music is so out.

14:58.480 --> 15:01.941
Phoebe, he's gotta be in the room
for that to work.

15:02.860 --> 15:05.320
What are you guys talking about?

15:05.529 --> 15:08.031
We're talking about The Swing Kings...

15:08.282 --> 15:10.992
...and whether they're
the right way to go.

15:11.201 --> 15:13.870
I went to a wedding
where they had swing music...

15:14.038 --> 15:16.497
...and two months later
the couple divorced.

15:17.791 --> 15:21.169
I'm not saying
there's any connection here...

15:21.420 --> 15:24.756
...but they did tell me
that's why they got divorced.

15:26.425 --> 15:28.134
But I love swing music!

15:28.344 --> 15:30.011
But The Swing Kings?

15:30.262 --> 15:35.642
They suck so much that people actually die
at their concerts. They just stop living.

15:36.435 --> 15:39.729
When Monica and I went to see them,
we had fun.

15:39.980 --> 15:41.689
And there's another reason.

15:41.899 --> 15:46.194
- Well, what is the other reason?
- I don't want to say.

15:46.403 --> 15:49.989
Well, you have to,
because maybe it's stupid.

15:51.617 --> 15:55.870
It's just while Monica and I
were dancing to them...

15:56.121 --> 15:59.290
...it was the first time
I knew that...

15:59.875 --> 16:04.337
...you were the woman that I wanted
to dance all my dances with.

16:06.799 --> 16:09.092
Oh, crap.

16:16.850 --> 16:20.770
- Our table will be ready in just a few minutes.
- Oh, great.

16:21.021 --> 16:24.232
- Is your back feeling better?
- Yeah, it's fine.

16:24.441 --> 16:27.235
I guess, ahem, the more muscles you have...

16:27.486 --> 16:30.905
...the more they can
spasm out of control.

16:32.408 --> 16:34.784
- Kristen?
- Joey!

16:34.994 --> 16:36.536
- Hi.
- Hi.

16:38.038 --> 16:41.082
- What are you doing here?
- I like this place.

16:41.291 --> 16:46.045
And technically, technically,
I'm not breaking any rules, so...

16:46.255 --> 16:50.508
Well, Ross, this is Joey.
Joey, Ross.

16:50.759 --> 16:53.386
- Hi.
- Hi. It's nice to meet you.

16:53.637 --> 16:56.848
I used to have a friend named Joey.

16:58.017 --> 17:00.393
I don't anymore.

17:01.812 --> 17:04.814
Our table will be ready
in a couple minutes.

17:05.023 --> 17:09.152
Sure! I would love
to wait with you guys! Thanks!

17:13.073 --> 17:15.907
So Joey, you look familiar.

17:16.160 --> 17:18.869
Are you on TV or something?

17:19.079 --> 17:21.289
Joey doesn't like to talk about it...

17:21.540 --> 17:24.959
...but he's one of the stars
of Days of Our Lives.

17:25.836 --> 17:30.006
That's right. That's right.
Don't you play a woman?

17:32.968 --> 17:36.054
A woman in a man's body.

17:36.305 --> 17:38.389
Much better.

17:39.516 --> 17:42.602
So, Ross, it's funny, because you
look familiar to me too.

17:42.853 --> 17:45.354
Have you ever been married?

17:47.107 --> 17:48.149
Yes, I have.

17:48.400 --> 17:50.651
In fact, just the other day...

17:50.861 --> 17:55.031
...Kris and I talked about how
I've been married and have a son.

17:55.282 --> 17:59.327
- Yeah, little Eric.
- That's right. Wait. No, Ben.

18:01.955 --> 18:05.166
So you've just been married
the one time then?

18:07.461 --> 18:11.297
- Well, um...
- You've been married twice?

18:11.507 --> 18:15.259
Yes. And...

18:15.469 --> 18:18.179
...another time after that.

18:20.224 --> 18:23.226
Boy, I'm getting hungry.

18:23.477 --> 18:26.562
Ahem. Hey, Joey, have you ever been
so hungry on a date...

18:26.814 --> 18:31.234
...that when the girl goes to the
bathroom, you eat some of her food?

18:33.654 --> 18:36.948
You said the waiter ate my crab cake.

18:39.034 --> 18:43.913
So, Ross, now why did
that first marriage break up? Hm?

18:44.581 --> 18:49.210
Was it because the woman was straight
or because she was a lesbian?

18:50.712 --> 18:53.923
- Do you two know each other?
- No.

18:54.133 --> 18:56.968
But he seems like
a guy who'd marry a woman...

18:57.177 --> 19:01.722
...on the verge of being a lesbian
and then push her over the edge.

19:04.643 --> 19:09.272
Wait a minute!
Were you on a poster for gonorrhea?

19:12.025 --> 19:15.653
Have you ever slept
in the same bed with a monkey?

19:16.446 --> 19:18.781
Hey, you leave Marcel out of this!

19:18.991 --> 19:21.868
Fine! You ever gotten stuck
in a pair of your own leather pants?

19:22.035 --> 19:27.456
Hey, hey! Have you ever locked yourself
in a TV cabinet, VD-boy?

19:27.666 --> 19:29.917
Monkey-lover!

19:37.718 --> 19:40.136
Where do you think we lost her?

19:40.554 --> 19:43.139
Probably around "gonorrhea."

19:51.315 --> 19:54.108
- Hi, honey, I'm home!
- Don't come in here!

19:54.359 --> 19:58.196
Why, do you have another
boyfriend in there?

19:58.405 --> 20:01.407
No. We only mess around at his place.

20:02.242 --> 20:07.246
It's funny, I started it, but now it's scaring me,
so could you come out here, please?

20:07.497 --> 20:09.207
No. I'm wearing a wedding dress.

20:09.416 --> 20:11.125
You got a wedding dress? That's great.

20:11.335 --> 20:14.962
- Yeah, but I'm not keeping it.
- Then why can't I see it?

20:15.214 --> 20:17.048
Oh. I guess you can.

20:17.299 --> 20:20.426
But I have to return it,
so you can't like it.

20:20.636 --> 20:23.846
Okay, I promise. I'll hate it.

20:29.436 --> 20:32.897
Wow. You look hideous.

20:34.233 --> 20:35.483
Really?

20:35.692 --> 20:40.613
Yeah. That's like the most
ugliest dress I've ever seen.

20:40.822 --> 20:42.865
Why do you have to return it?

20:43.075 --> 20:46.035
Because it doesn't really fit.

20:46.286 --> 20:48.329
Oh, by the way, I booked The Swing Kings.

20:48.538 --> 20:51.457
Oh, that's great. Great. Thanks.

20:51.667 --> 20:54.377
But that dress, I mean, it's like, ugh, terrible.

20:54.586 --> 20:58.130
- It makes me want to rip it right off you.
- Okay.

20:58.340 --> 21:00.049
But you can't rip it.

21:00.300 --> 21:02.093
- Well, maybe a little.
- Okay.

21:10.852 --> 21:14.855
Hey, guys, you want to look
at the song list for the wedding?

21:15.315 --> 21:16.482
Guys?

21:16.692 --> 21:18.859
I thought you'd be gone all day.

21:19.069 --> 21:21.779
All right, what's going on?

21:29.955 --> 21:34.083
I'm sorry. I should probably
leave you girls alone.

21:34.793 --> 21:38.963
Laugh all you want, but in 10 minutes
we'll have younger-looking skin.

21:39.131 --> 21:40.840
- Yeah.
- Right there.

21:43.176 --> 21:44.844
You know, she could use a little...

21:46.555 --> 21:48.931
- Oh, nice shot! Yeah!
- Oh! Oh! Oh!
