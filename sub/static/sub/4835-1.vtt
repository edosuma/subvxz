WEBVTT

01:09.487 --> 01:12.949
THREE COLORS
WHITE

02:02.665 --> 02:05.335
I have a paper... a summons.

02:05.502 --> 02:07.420
That way, sir.

03:26.332 --> 03:30.336
<i>Can you tell us your concrete
reasons for wanting a divorce?</i>

03:30.461 --> 03:34.007
Can you tell us your concrete
reasons for wanting a divorce?

03:34.424 --> 03:35.758
<i>Concrete?</i>

03:36.426 --> 03:38.428
Yes, your concrete reasons.

03:45.059 --> 03:47.270
Our marriage
was never consummated.

03:47.437 --> 03:50.023
Our marriage
was never consummated.

03:54.402 --> 03:58.364
Is your wife's testimony
faithful to the facts?

04:06.456 --> 04:07.957
In a manner of speaking.

04:17.800 --> 04:19.844
But when we met in Poland,

04:20.011 --> 04:23.806
and even here, in the beginning,
I believe I gave my wife pleasure.

04:25.934 --> 04:27.977
It was only later that...

04:40.365 --> 04:42.450
We haven't made love
since we got married.

04:42.575 --> 04:47.038
I mean... I stopped being able to.
It's just temporary.

04:54.879 --> 04:56.631
Where's the equality here?

05:00.343 --> 05:04.847
Is the fact I don't speak French
any reason to refuse

05:04.973 --> 05:06.432
to hear my side?

05:06.557 --> 05:08.559
What is it exactly that you want?

05:14.732 --> 05:17.193
I need time, Your Honor.

05:23.533 --> 05:25.493
I want to save our marriage.

05:25.618 --> 05:28.871
I don't believe there's no longer
any feeling between us.

05:37.213 --> 05:39.382
One night I was ready to...

05:40.883 --> 05:43.678
Was the marriage
consummated that night?

05:54.647 --> 05:56.190
<i>No.</i>

06:14.083 --> 06:15.710
I beg your pardon?

06:16.085 --> 06:18.171
Do you love your husband?

06:20.840 --> 06:22.675
I used to love him.

06:26.220 --> 06:27.680
And now?

06:36.606 --> 06:38.483
I don't love him anymore.

06:41.944 --> 06:43.613
My God!

07:40.837 --> 07:42.296
That's everything.

07:53.850 --> 07:55.393
Dominique!

08:35.349 --> 08:38.019
ENTER YOUR CODE,
THEN PRESS "VALIDATE"

08:53.492 --> 08:56.412
CARD CONFISCATED

08:56.579 --> 08:58.289
<i>Karol Karol?</i>

08:58.956 --> 09:00.917
<i>Your account's been frozen.</i>

09:02.585 --> 09:03.586
Frozen?

09:03.753 --> 09:05.671
<i>That's right.
Your card is no longer valid.</i>

09:05.796 --> 09:07.798
<i>It's invalidated. Canceled.</i>

09:09.258 --> 09:11.636
- My card.
<i>- I can't give it to you.</i>

09:18.142 --> 09:19.602
My money...

11:27.188 --> 11:28.689
Police?

11:30.566 --> 11:32.068
Please.

13:30.019 --> 13:31.687
Well...?

13:33.063 --> 13:34.607
I'm sorry.

13:37.193 --> 13:39.111
Come to Poland with me.

13:40.154 --> 13:41.822
I'll never go with you.

13:43.407 --> 13:46.202
I'll win every trial.

13:47.411 --> 13:50.039
The divorce, the property settlement —
everything.

13:53.292 --> 13:55.377
Because you never understood.

13:56.962 --> 13:59.590
- I understand.
- No.

14:03.552 --> 14:06.222
If I say I love you,
you don't understand.

14:07.223 --> 14:10.351
And if I say I hate you,
you still don't understand.

14:11.560 --> 14:14.230
You don't even understand
that I want you,

14:14.688 --> 14:16.524
that I need you.

14:17.233 --> 14:18.734
You understand?

14:20.903 --> 14:22.321
You understand?

14:22.446 --> 14:23.656
No.

14:26.200 --> 14:28.369
Do I scare you now?

14:30.246 --> 14:33.415
Do I scare you?
- I don't know.

14:35.209 --> 14:36.877
You don't know.

14:39.755 --> 14:41.465
Well, watch this.

14:43.384 --> 14:44.927
Watch carefully.

14:52.226 --> 14:54.270
You came here to get revenge.

14:55.229 --> 14:57.231
You set the place on fire.

14:58.482 --> 15:00.234
That's what happened.

15:04.863 --> 15:07.616
Soon every cop in Paris
will be after you.

15:11.912 --> 15:13.080
The keys!

16:26.695 --> 16:28.656
Your fly's open.

16:32.242 --> 16:33.577
Excuse me.

16:36.372 --> 16:40.042
How did you know I was Polish?
- I know that song.

16:40.834 --> 16:42.336
What about this one?

16:46.715 --> 16:48.050
I don't like that one.

16:51.595 --> 16:54.348
You make your living with that comb?

16:54.473 --> 16:56.517
I try. Times are tough.

16:57.601 --> 16:59.895
- What are those?
- Diplomas.

17:08.069 --> 17:09.570
Hairdresser?

17:11.490 --> 17:13.157
Not a bad profession.

17:14.576 --> 17:16.662
I've won competitions.

17:16.829 --> 17:19.540
Sofia, Budapest, Warsaw.

17:20.207 --> 17:21.666
Here too.

17:23.419 --> 17:25.128
Where do you sleep?

17:26.672 --> 17:28.757
In your suitcase?

17:31.301 --> 17:32.928
Forgive me.

17:34.513 --> 17:35.973
Mikołaj.

17:38.350 --> 17:39.685
Karol.

17:41.395 --> 17:43.397
There's an alcove over there.

18:07.129 --> 18:09.465
Mind if I sit with you for a bit?

18:31.320 --> 18:33.155
You do card tricks?

18:33.989 --> 18:35.783
Pick 13 cards.

18:47.419 --> 18:50.839
Spades: 3, 4, queen, king.

18:50.964 --> 18:53.550
Diamonds: 2, 5, ace.

18:53.675 --> 18:56.678
Clubs: 3, 5, king.

18:57.763 --> 19:00.224
Hearts are weak: 2 and 4.

19:01.850 --> 19:04.019
What counts in bridge is memory...

19:04.895 --> 19:07.314
and mine is excellent.

19:10.859 --> 19:14.488
I've played in a bridge club
here for a few years.

19:14.613 --> 19:16.824
Now I'm going home.
What about you?

19:22.538 --> 19:25.332
I want to get out of here.

19:29.211 --> 19:31.213
I'll take you back.

19:32.548 --> 19:34.174
Tomorrow morning.

19:37.094 --> 19:39.346
I think I doubt that.

19:41.765 --> 19:44.601
I've lost my passport.
I have no money.

19:44.726 --> 19:46.854
The police are after me.

19:46.979 --> 19:50.065
My luck's run out.

19:52.734 --> 19:56.989
I'll make enough to buy
a fake passport near the Polish church.

19:57.114 --> 19:58.949
They're rip-off artists.

19:59.074 --> 20:00.075
Rip-off artists.

20:00.242 --> 20:01.910
You can't trust 'em.

20:02.619 --> 20:06.665
I offered one a good job.
He took the money and ran.

20:08.166 --> 20:09.835
Maybe you'd be interested.

20:09.960 --> 20:11.628
A good job?

20:11.753 --> 20:14.089
Very good, but unpleasant.

20:15.591 --> 20:17.342
I'm a hairdresser.

20:18.552 --> 20:20.554
You'd have to kill someone.

20:25.726 --> 20:27.686
The guy wants to die.

20:28.353 --> 20:30.647
Says he has no reason to go on.

20:32.941 --> 20:34.484
A fellow countryman.

20:34.610 --> 20:38.947
He'll pay well.
Enough to live on for six months.

20:42.242 --> 20:44.953
No... not that.

20:46.747 --> 20:48.707
Can't he do it himself?

20:48.916 --> 20:51.126
He wants to, but he can't.

20:51.919 --> 20:55.297
He has a wife and children
who love him.

20:56.798 --> 20:59.468
Can you imagine how they'd feel?

20:59.801 --> 21:02.387
This way, someone kills him
and it's over.

21:02.638 --> 21:07.184
He has a wife, children, money —
and he doesn't want to live?

21:08.435 --> 21:10.646
What am I supposed to say?

21:11.813 --> 21:14.816
My wife threw me out
with one suitcase...

21:15.317 --> 21:17.027
and here I am.

21:18.862 --> 21:20.739
And I still love her.

21:21.657 --> 21:23.617
Even more than before.

21:25.035 --> 21:27.579
After all she did, I still love her.

21:28.163 --> 21:29.831
Is she pretty?

21:32.834 --> 21:34.544
Beautiful.

21:37.255 --> 21:40.509
When I saw her for the first time
at the Budapest competition,

21:40.676 --> 21:42.177
I won the prize.

21:42.344 --> 21:44.429
A friend was doing her hair.

21:45.806 --> 21:47.891
She looked at me.

21:53.689 --> 21:55.190
I'll show you.

21:56.358 --> 21:57.526
Where?

21:57.651 --> 21:59.027
Come on.

22:07.285 --> 22:10.205
Brigitte Bardot? Beautiful!

22:10.580 --> 22:12.165
But a bit over the hill, no?

22:12.290 --> 22:13.875
There!

22:26.596 --> 22:28.807
She's gone to sleep.

22:36.857 --> 22:37.899
Think so?

23:14.936 --> 23:16.772
It's me.

23:18.065 --> 23:19.983
<i>Good timing. Listen.</i>

23:36.625 --> 23:38.668
Dominique, I love you.

24:22.212 --> 24:23.964
It stole two francs.

24:26.174 --> 24:28.009
Your telephone stole two francs.

24:28.176 --> 24:29.344
So?

24:29.803 --> 24:32.097
Give me back the money it stole.

24:33.515 --> 24:35.684
Give it back!

24:56.454 --> 24:58.456
You're taking me to Poland.

25:00.000 --> 25:01.501
I know how.

25:02.294 --> 25:03.628
How?

25:04.212 --> 25:05.714
Move your arm.

25:26.568 --> 25:28.153
For air.

25:30.906 --> 25:33.200
Will you last four hours?

25:33.742 --> 25:35.243
I'll last.

25:35.994 --> 25:38.747
There's one thing I have to do.
- What?

25:40.540 --> 25:41.750
Steal something.

27:45.123 --> 27:47.375
Is that everything from Paris?

27:47.542 --> 27:49.127
Yes. Why?

27:52.881 --> 27:54.549
<i>May I help you?</i>

27:56.676 --> 27:59.054
My suitcase is missing.

27:59.220 --> 28:01.056
<i>- Ticket, please.</i>
- Excuse me?

28:01.181 --> 28:03.224
<i>Your ticket, please.</i>

28:07.937 --> 28:09.939
<i>The flight from Paris?</i>

28:10.607 --> 28:12.400
<i>What was inside?</i>

28:12.901 --> 28:14.319
Personal belongings.

28:14.444 --> 28:18.114
- Clothes, shirts...
- 165 pounds' worth?

28:23.578 --> 28:26.164
To tell the truth,
my friend was inside.

29:12.085 --> 29:15.004
We'll split it five ways,
and I get two.

29:15.797 --> 29:18.258
- Why?
- Handling charges.

29:21.636 --> 29:23.555
Fuck! It's a guy!

29:24.097 --> 29:25.807
What the hell!

29:26.433 --> 29:27.976
Get him out!

29:39.320 --> 29:41.823
Made in Russia! Fuck!

29:42.699 --> 29:45.702
Stop it!
He could have a wallet.

29:55.920 --> 29:58.423
Two francs! Shit!

29:58.548 --> 30:00.049
Give it back!

30:01.092 --> 30:03.094
Watch out! He's got scissors!

30:17.775 --> 30:19.652
Let's get the fuck outta here.

30:19.777 --> 30:21.154
Let's split.

31:04.197 --> 31:05.698
Jesus...

31:06.533 --> 31:08.493
home at last.

31:58.167 --> 31:59.168
Karol?

32:16.352 --> 32:19.314
Dear Jesus, how'd you get here?

32:20.023 --> 32:21.691
What happened?

32:21.941 --> 32:25.653
- You got a neon sign.
- This is Europe now, my friend.

32:26.195 --> 32:28.823
Too bad you missed Christmas.

32:30.241 --> 32:31.326
Too bad.

32:35.371 --> 32:37.206
Just a minute, please.

32:45.506 --> 32:46.883
Jurek...

32:47.008 --> 32:49.969
I heard Karol's back.
- Yes...

32:50.720 --> 32:51.721
he is.

33:06.235 --> 33:08.237
Well?

33:10.156 --> 33:13.201
The ladies are asking for you.

33:13.534 --> 33:15.328
A few more days.

33:15.995 --> 33:18.164
I brought you some broth.

33:26.130 --> 33:27.507
Sleep.

33:31.052 --> 33:33.262
Sleep, sleep...

35:05.104 --> 35:08.232
Mr. Karol, remember you have
an appointment today.

35:08.357 --> 35:10.026
Oh, thank you!

35:14.322 --> 35:15.656
What's up?

35:20.828 --> 35:23.164
What is it?
- It's payday.

35:24.957 --> 35:26.876
You have clients waiting.

35:27.001 --> 35:29.045
I can't today. You do them.

35:29.170 --> 35:31.798
They don't want me anymore.

35:46.813 --> 35:48.147
The door!

35:50.149 --> 35:51.651
Sorry.

35:51.776 --> 35:53.194
What is it?

35:53.361 --> 35:56.489
I have an appointment.
Jadwiga said —

35:56.614 --> 35:58.115
You do her hair?

35:58.407 --> 35:59.575
Yes.

35:59.700 --> 36:01.244
Is that all?

36:04.914 --> 36:06.833
Okay. What do you want?

36:08.709 --> 36:12.964
I'd like to make some money.

36:13.089 --> 36:14.799
In my line,
it takes years to get ahead.

36:14.924 --> 36:16.259
I can believe it.

36:16.926 --> 36:20.555
Seems you found
a clever way out of Paris.

36:23.182 --> 36:25.518
You're plain-looking.

36:27.895 --> 36:29.939
That's good. I need a guard.

36:31.649 --> 36:34.277
Relax. It only shoots tear gas.

36:38.573 --> 36:40.408
Go wander around outside.

37:28.122 --> 37:29.790
Present perfect:

37:29.957 --> 37:32.543
I have eaten. You have eaten.
He has eaten.

37:32.668 --> 37:36.964
We have eaten. You have eaten.
They have eaten.

37:37.924 --> 37:39.467
<i>Repeat:</i>

37:40.134 --> 37:42.011
<i>Would that I had eaten...</i>

37:42.970 --> 37:44.889
<i>Would that you had eaten...</i>

37:56.734 --> 37:58.527
<i>The verb "to sleep."</i>

37:58.903 --> 38:00.321
<i>Repeat:</i>

38:00.488 --> 38:02.281
<i>Would that I had slept...</i>

38:02.573 --> 38:04.575
<i>Would that you had slept...</i>

38:14.710 --> 38:16.754
<i>The verb "to leave."</i>

38:16.963 --> 38:18.339
<i>Repeat:</i>

38:18.798 --> 38:20.675
<i>Would that I had left...</i>

38:20.925 --> 38:22.843
<i>Would that you had left...</i>

38:32.061 --> 38:34.855
<i>The verb "to please."
Repeat:</i>

38:35.439 --> 38:37.108
<i>Would that I had pleased...</i>

38:50.204 --> 38:52.790
How about a gas mask?

38:55.584 --> 38:57.878
- What?
- Someone's watching us.

38:58.212 --> 39:01.215
- Let him.
- A big guy. Just standing there.

39:03.342 --> 39:04.719
Just a minute.

39:05.052 --> 39:06.554
Where?

39:16.397 --> 39:18.024
Hide me.

39:18.149 --> 39:20.192
- What?
- Hide me!

39:24.405 --> 39:26.741
So... are you happy here?

39:27.533 --> 39:28.826
In the bathroom?

39:28.951 --> 39:31.078
No, in general.

39:31.746 --> 39:33.289
Yeah. Why?

39:33.706 --> 39:37.084
No reason.
Stay as long as you like,

39:37.209 --> 39:39.253
but we have to come to an agreement.

39:39.920 --> 39:41.797
- I can pay you.
- No.

39:43.049 --> 39:45.259
I'd like you to do some hair.

39:46.177 --> 39:47.928
Ten heads — okay?

39:49.013 --> 39:50.514
A week.

39:52.266 --> 39:53.266
Five.

39:53.809 --> 39:55.603
Okay, seven.

39:56.103 --> 40:00.441
Ah, some guy was looking for you.

40:00.775 --> 40:02.985
Not too tall. Forty-ish.

40:03.402 --> 40:05.112
Sad-looking.

40:05.237 --> 40:06.280
Mikołaj?

40:10.242 --> 40:12.244
He brought me back from Paris.

40:12.369 --> 40:15.372
That's why he was so glad
to hear you're alive.

40:15.664 --> 40:17.666
Did he leave a phone number?

40:17.792 --> 40:20.836
No, he just said to say hi.

40:20.961 --> 40:22.546
Then he left.

40:24.673 --> 40:26.383
"Hi..."

40:43.067 --> 40:45.820
In Gdańsk, we'll exchange 30.
In Toruń, twice that.

40:45.986 --> 40:49.323
Put it in a bank and get a loan.

40:49.448 --> 40:52.451
You have to turn here.

40:54.203 --> 40:56.163
It's up the hill.

40:58.999 --> 41:00.793
Just seven percent.

41:01.877 --> 41:04.338
But if we triple our investment —

41:04.547 --> 41:06.257
You're a smart one.

41:17.768 --> 41:19.603
Is that dimwit asleep?

41:29.655 --> 41:31.073
Right there.

41:32.199 --> 41:35.244
Hartwig and Ikea
want to build warehouses there.

41:40.916 --> 41:44.295
None of these bumpkins
have any idea.

41:44.420 --> 41:46.046
No one does.

41:47.173 --> 41:50.676
And I'm not breathing a word.
Thirty percent profit.

41:55.890 --> 41:58.392
- We'll talk when it's confirmed.
- Okay.

42:06.901 --> 42:09.278
Wake up or you'll get robbed!

42:14.742 --> 42:16.410
Can you exchange this?

42:17.119 --> 42:18.495
For dollars?

42:19.121 --> 42:21.081
That's some nest egg.

42:21.498 --> 42:23.000
I work.

42:34.845 --> 42:37.431
- Yes?
- A bottle of vodka.

42:38.390 --> 42:40.100
Your most expensive.

42:42.770 --> 42:44.230
Wrap it up, please.

43:08.337 --> 43:09.338
Hello.

43:12.841 --> 43:14.551
I'm here on business.

43:16.053 --> 43:17.680
Official?

43:17.805 --> 43:20.391
No, just something
you might be interested in.

43:22.393 --> 43:23.894
Can I come in?

43:53.090 --> 43:55.718
Must be a valuable piece of land.

43:56.176 --> 43:58.554
- You wanted to move in with your son!
- Yeah.

43:58.679 --> 44:02.308
Then do it!
Buy yourself a car and a TV.

44:02.433 --> 44:04.852
What for? I never watch it.

44:04.977 --> 44:06.687
It's always the same crap.

44:11.608 --> 44:12.985
But maybe...

44:13.110 --> 44:14.987
I could bury the money...

44:15.362 --> 44:17.448
put it in a little jar.

44:17.740 --> 44:19.408
Sure!

44:19.658 --> 44:21.535
That would be nice.

44:22.119 --> 44:23.829
One thousand dollars.

44:24.955 --> 44:28.625
As a down payment.
$4,000 more when it's notarized.

44:57.863 --> 44:59.907
I have to go.
- What?

45:00.324 --> 45:01.575
It's the last train.

45:01.742 --> 45:03.744
You're wandering around at night?

45:03.869 --> 45:06.955
They'll mug you and steal
your briefcase. Sleep here.

45:07.247 --> 45:09.249
There's a bed upstairs.

45:11.251 --> 45:13.170
It's your bed now.

47:20.839 --> 47:21.882
Hi.

47:22.716 --> 47:23.967
Hi.

47:24.718 --> 47:26.720
You're alive.

47:26.929 --> 47:29.389
They stole the suitcase,
with me inside.

47:29.556 --> 47:31.558
I know. Your brother told me.

47:32.059 --> 47:34.978
I've been looking for you.
- Same here.

47:38.315 --> 47:39.983
Well...

47:41.068 --> 47:42.611
what's up?

47:46.865 --> 47:49.409
In the metro
you mentioned a guy who —

47:49.535 --> 47:51.161
You remember?

47:52.746 --> 47:55.457
Can you get in touch with him?

47:55.582 --> 47:57.334
Yes, I can.

47:57.459 --> 48:01.463
When someone asks for help,
you have to help him, right?

48:04.383 --> 48:06.802
Except he's back here
in Warsaw now.

48:08.929 --> 48:10.931
So he's not interested anymore?

48:15.185 --> 48:16.770
Yes, he is.

48:17.104 --> 48:18.939
More than ever.

49:49.029 --> 49:50.364
Well?

49:51.365 --> 49:53.283
Has he changed his mind?

49:53.867 --> 49:55.285
No.

49:55.410 --> 49:56.953
It's me.

49:59.331 --> 50:01.375
Does that change anything?

50:03.627 --> 50:04.627
No.

50:05.921 --> 50:08.298
So... it's you.
- How will you do it?

50:19.267 --> 50:21.478
These days you can buy anything.

50:23.980 --> 50:25.982
The envelope's in my pocket.

50:28.985 --> 50:30.904
Take it afterward.

50:37.577 --> 50:39.079
Well?

50:45.419 --> 50:46.962
You sure?

51:35.051 --> 51:36.845
That was a blank.

51:40.307 --> 51:42.309
The next one is for real.

51:46.480 --> 51:48.148
Are you sure?

51:54.154 --> 51:55.822
Are you sure?

52:02.954 --> 52:04.831
Not anymore.

52:24.142 --> 52:26.228
Now will you tell me why?

52:33.026 --> 52:34.319
Mikołaj...

52:36.780 --> 52:38.657
we all know pain.

52:40.408 --> 52:41.785
Sure...

52:42.702 --> 52:44.955
but I wanted less of it.

52:52.337 --> 52:54.381
Per our deal.

52:56.591 --> 52:57.592
Take it.

52:58.218 --> 52:59.886
You earned it.

53:03.682 --> 53:05.350
I earned it.

53:07.060 --> 53:09.145
But consider it a loan.

53:10.397 --> 53:12.232
How about a drink?

53:43.889 --> 53:46.141
I feel like a kid again.

53:48.602 --> 53:49.936
Me too.

53:54.316 --> 53:56.234
Everything's possible.

55:26.449 --> 55:29.786
You beat us to it.
You bought the land.

55:44.467 --> 55:46.302
Choke it out of him.

55:55.020 --> 55:56.855
You eavesdropped on us.

55:59.232 --> 56:00.900
Yeah, I did.

56:01.651 --> 56:04.571
I've put it all in a will.

56:06.281 --> 56:08.700
And it's airtight.

56:10.660 --> 56:12.954
What do you mean, "airtight"?

56:14.080 --> 56:16.958
If anything happens,
it all goes to the church.

56:18.501 --> 56:20.211
Jesus!

56:20.962 --> 56:22.464
The church.

56:24.758 --> 56:26.926
We can't touch it.
Let him go.

56:32.432 --> 56:34.768
You're lucky the stove wasn't lit.

56:46.154 --> 56:47.655
Let's talk.

56:56.998 --> 56:58.500
Are you selling?

57:00.210 --> 57:01.210
Yeah.

57:03.129 --> 57:05.215
He's selling.

57:05.507 --> 57:07.008
How much?

57:08.301 --> 57:09.886
Ten times what I paid.

57:10.011 --> 57:11.930
Fifty thousand dollars.

57:18.520 --> 57:20.814
Excuse me while I get dressed.

57:26.653 --> 57:28.738
Did you hear that bastard?

57:46.005 --> 57:48.842
- What the hell's going on?
- It's okay.

57:49.884 --> 57:51.845
I'll be able to pay you back.

57:53.304 --> 57:55.056
Shall I light the stove?

57:58.351 --> 58:00.228
Shall I light the stove?

58:00.353 --> 58:01.688
Later.

58:03.439 --> 58:05.441
This may interest you.

58:05.567 --> 58:07.569
I have a plot here...

58:08.361 --> 58:10.280
here... and here.

58:10.697 --> 58:13.575
- Right in the middle.
- Exactly.

58:13.700 --> 58:16.369
I couldn't resist this one.
A beautiful spot.

58:16.536 --> 58:18.371
With birch saplings.

58:19.038 --> 58:20.623
Which means?

58:21.166 --> 58:23.334
Same as before:
ten times what I paid.

58:23.710 --> 58:26.504
I have everything: bills, contracts.

58:26.629 --> 58:28.339
That's the situation...

58:30.216 --> 58:31.718
for now.

58:32.802 --> 58:34.304
It's a deal.

58:36.389 --> 58:38.308
But you're a real son of a bitch.

58:38.433 --> 58:40.476
I just need the money.

58:40.602 --> 58:43.271
Excuse me.
Should I light the stove?

58:43.396 --> 58:45.523
Yeah, it's cold in here.

58:48.234 --> 58:49.736
Karol...

58:51.029 --> 58:54.365
could you do Jadwiga's hair today?

58:54.490 --> 58:55.992
Today?

58:56.826 --> 58:58.828
Why not? I have time.

59:28.316 --> 59:30.568
<i>Should I cut the engine, boss?</i>

59:30.777 --> 59:33.196
<i>No, keep the car warm.</i>

59:45.917 --> 59:47.043
Hey there.

59:48.836 --> 59:51.631
You bought the whole store!
- Presents.

59:52.090 --> 59:54.801
Come inside?
- No, I'll just be a second.

59:54.968 --> 59:56.469
What is it?

59:57.262 --> 59:59.055
I'm starting a company.

59:59.722 --> 01:00:01.224
Big-time.

01:00:01.432 --> 01:00:05.520
Thirty percent of the capital
came from the money you gave me...

01:00:06.729 --> 01:00:09.857
so like it or not, you're a joint owner.

01:00:10.483 --> 01:00:11.651
I'd like you

01:00:11.818 --> 01:00:13.528
to run it with me.

01:00:14.195 --> 01:00:15.780
You're serious?

01:00:16.698 --> 01:00:18.199
I'm serious.

01:00:20.785 --> 01:00:22.287
A Volvo.

01:00:25.498 --> 01:00:26.833
Burgundy.

01:00:28.293 --> 01:00:31.212
Yeah. It's on the company.

01:00:33.798 --> 01:00:36.467
Give me a little time to think it over?

01:00:39.053 --> 01:00:40.596
Merry Christmas.

01:01:13.671 --> 01:01:17.508
This area's ideal for a secretary.
This way, please.

01:01:21.387 --> 01:01:23.264
And here's a second office.

01:01:23.431 --> 01:01:25.099
Spacious, isn't it?

01:01:26.225 --> 01:01:30.021
And I think
the view's quite nice too.

01:01:32.273 --> 01:01:34.609
Computer and satellite hookups.

01:01:34.734 --> 01:01:37.195
We'll need two faxes.

01:01:37.320 --> 01:01:39.113
Where do we plug them in?

01:01:39.322 --> 01:01:41.574
You have three phone lines.

01:01:42.075 --> 01:01:45.036
- Right... they use phone lines.
- Yes.

01:01:45.328 --> 01:01:47.163
Okay, I think...

01:01:47.747 --> 01:01:49.665
we'll take the whole thing.

01:01:49.791 --> 01:01:51.042
Wonderful.

01:01:51.167 --> 01:01:54.962
Would you step into my office?
- Just give us a minute.

01:02:00.843 --> 01:02:02.845
Would you have a handkerchief?

01:02:03.346 --> 01:02:06.015
A handkerchief? Here you are.

01:02:25.535 --> 01:02:27.036
Nice.

01:02:29.539 --> 01:02:31.249
Warsaw at our feet.

01:02:31.958 --> 01:02:34.460
- What's that?
- Returned merchandise.

01:02:34.669 --> 01:02:36.337
- Bananas?
- Yes.

01:02:36.462 --> 01:02:39.340
Put them in cold storage
and wait for prices to go up.

01:02:42.301 --> 01:02:45.263
Jacek, there's a fax coming in.

01:02:50.101 --> 01:02:52.478
Electronic equipment.
Thailand en route to Russia.

01:02:52.603 --> 01:02:56.107
Sell it here.
My experts say it's good stuff.

01:02:57.316 --> 01:02:59.777
It looks like good work.

01:03:02.447 --> 01:03:04.323
How thick should that wall be?

01:03:04.490 --> 01:03:06.075
Twenty inches.

01:03:06.200 --> 01:03:08.077
Measure it, Jacek.

01:03:10.496 --> 01:03:12.165
Eighteen inches.

01:03:12.331 --> 01:03:14.750
Have those two inches added.

01:03:14.876 --> 01:03:17.044
We'd have to knock
the whole thing down.

01:03:17.170 --> 01:03:19.505
I guess so. See you.

01:03:20.173 --> 01:03:21.674
Good-bye.

01:03:38.483 --> 01:03:39.984
Dominique...

01:04:21.234 --> 01:04:23.694
It's Karol.
I'm calling from Warsaw.

01:04:25.321 --> 01:04:26.572
Poland.

01:04:32.453 --> 01:04:34.997
I'm sorry.
I just wanted to hear your voice.

01:04:38.793 --> 01:04:40.461
Say something.

01:04:43.714 --> 01:04:45.258
Anything.

01:05:22.628 --> 01:05:26.007
<i>"I hereby annul
my previous will and testament</i>

01:05:26.132 --> 01:05:28.551
<i>and resolve that..."</i>

01:05:28.676 --> 01:05:31.596
That in the case of my death...

01:05:33.806 --> 01:05:35.474
my death...

01:05:36.642 --> 01:05:39.061
all my personal belongings...

01:05:41.022 --> 01:05:42.773
and property...

01:05:44.984 --> 01:05:47.445
as well as any sums...

01:05:47.653 --> 01:05:49.155
Of money...

01:05:49.488 --> 01:05:52.950
...of money in my bank accounts

01:05:53.743 --> 01:05:57.997
will be left to my ex-wife, Dominique.

01:06:01.375 --> 01:06:02.835
Dominique.

01:06:03.669 --> 01:06:06.047
With Q-U-E on the end.

01:06:06.631 --> 01:06:08.924
I know how to spell Dominique.

01:06:33.449 --> 01:06:35.660
Why'd you drag me out here?

01:06:36.369 --> 01:06:39.914
All those devices in the office —
who knows who's listening in?

01:06:40.039 --> 01:06:41.415
Like who?

01:06:41.874 --> 01:06:46.337
How would I know?
I wanted to ask you something.

01:06:46.671 --> 01:06:47.671
Ask away.

01:06:50.424 --> 01:06:54.428
Please don't be surprised to see
my obituaries in the paper.

01:06:55.012 --> 01:06:57.390
One will be signed by you.

01:06:59.558 --> 01:07:01.310
All right.

01:07:02.937 --> 01:07:07.233
My lawyer has my will.
You're the executor.

01:07:07.358 --> 01:07:09.235
Here are the names
and telephone numbers.

01:07:12.905 --> 01:07:15.199
You want me
to drag her here from Paris?

01:07:16.867 --> 01:07:19.370
Will she come?
- She'll come.

01:07:19.995 --> 01:07:21.956
It's a lot of money.

01:07:24.917 --> 01:07:27.128
Don't you want to know why?

01:07:27.420 --> 01:07:28.754
No.

01:07:30.798 --> 01:07:33.384
You'll need another passport.

01:08:01.954 --> 01:08:04.373
<i>You may now have the death certificate.</i>

01:08:04.498 --> 01:08:06.625
<i>My condolences.</i>

01:08:20.096 --> 01:08:22.183
All taken care of.

01:08:30.149 --> 01:08:32.902
- You know what we need next?
- What?

01:08:37.490 --> 01:08:39.783
Someone to bury.

01:08:39.908 --> 01:08:41.535
A corpse?

01:08:42.953 --> 01:08:45.622
You don't plan to...?

01:08:45.747 --> 01:08:47.166
No.

01:08:48.375 --> 01:08:50.502
We'll buy one.

01:08:50.920 --> 01:08:53.464
These days you can buy anything.
- Think so?

01:08:54.756 --> 01:08:58.551
What would you say
to a Russian import?

01:09:17.029 --> 01:09:19.198
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

01:09:20.533 --> 01:09:22.033
Let's go.

01:09:36.048 --> 01:09:38.216
Couldn't be better, boss.

01:09:39.718 --> 01:09:41.720
He's beyond identification.

01:09:42.971 --> 01:09:44.305
What happened?

01:09:44.430 --> 01:09:46.392
His head got crushed.

01:09:46.809 --> 01:09:49.854
Seems he leaned too far
out a streetcar window.

01:09:51.564 --> 01:09:53.189
Let's close it up.

01:10:03.409 --> 01:10:05.077
I'll manage from here.

01:10:05.202 --> 01:10:08.330
Okay. Good night, boss.

01:10:09.415 --> 01:10:11.041
I'll close up.

01:10:46.493 --> 01:10:48.412
Jesus!

01:10:48.537 --> 01:10:52.207
You scared me.
- Why? You knew I was coming.

01:10:52.333 --> 01:10:53.959
I don't know.

01:10:54.585 --> 01:10:56.921
Afraid of what's going to happen?

01:11:00.507 --> 01:11:02.468
Here's your passport

01:11:02.593 --> 01:11:05.262
and your ticket to Hong Kong.

01:11:05.387 --> 01:11:08.307
Here's the address.
I rented you a nice house.

01:11:11.060 --> 01:11:12.645
Are you sure?

01:11:18.609 --> 01:11:20.694
Just don't be late for the plane.

01:11:21.028 --> 01:11:23.822
I'll call the police at 10:00 sharp.

01:11:24.156 --> 01:11:27.284
They should be there
a half hour later.

01:11:27.660 --> 01:11:30.621
By 10:30 you'll be in the air.

01:11:31.205 --> 01:11:32.915
Simple, right?

01:11:33.082 --> 01:11:34.583
Simple.

01:11:39.588 --> 01:11:41.674
Mikołaj —
- See ya.

01:14:20.124 --> 01:14:22.126
I wanted you to come.

01:14:24.044 --> 01:14:26.380
I wanted to be sure.

01:14:26.713 --> 01:14:29.341
I didn't want to have
to ask anymore.

01:14:30.801 --> 01:14:32.469
Karol...

01:14:35.931 --> 01:14:37.850
You cried at my funeral.

01:14:39.393 --> 01:14:40.727
Why?

01:14:42.521 --> 01:14:45.274
Because you were dead.

01:14:49.570 --> 01:14:51.446
May I touch your hand?

01:15:04.459 --> 01:15:05.961
Sit down.

01:15:12.885 --> 01:15:15.012
May I lay my head there?

01:15:27.816 --> 01:15:31.320
I've wanted to lay
my head here for so long.

01:16:58.240 --> 01:17:00.826
You moaned louder
than on the phone.

01:17:01.451 --> 01:17:02.828
Yes.

01:17:07.874 --> 01:17:09.793
Won't you look at me?

01:19:29.349 --> 01:19:30.600
<i>The Mika Company.</i>

01:19:30.725 --> 01:19:34.104
- Mikołaj, please. This is Dominique.
<i>- I'll connect you.</i>

01:19:36.189 --> 01:19:38.066
It's Dominique. Where's Karol?

01:19:38.191 --> 01:19:40.318
<i>- He's dead.</i>
- He is not. I —

01:19:40.485 --> 01:19:42.821
<i>You were at his funeral yesterday.</i>

01:19:42.988 --> 01:19:45.907
I was not at his funeral.
He's alive.

01:19:46.283 --> 01:19:47.784
<i>I'm sorry...</i>

01:19:48.577 --> 01:19:50.954
Mikołaj, you have
to help me find him.

01:19:51.455 --> 01:19:52.622
I love him.

01:19:52.747 --> 01:19:57.502
<i>Of course I will.
It's section 23, tomb 10675.</i>

01:19:57.627 --> 01:20:00.964
<i>The name of the cemetery
is Powązkowski.</i>

01:20:02.299 --> 01:20:03.717
He's back!

01:20:03.842 --> 01:20:06.636
<i>- I doubt that.</i>
- I have to go.

01:20:12.017 --> 01:20:13.894
<i>Dominique Vidal?</i>

01:20:14.769 --> 01:20:16.188
Police.

01:20:17.898 --> 01:20:21.359
- Your passport, please.
- It's at the front desk.

01:20:22.527 --> 01:20:24.196
Please call downstairs.

01:20:37.667 --> 01:20:41.213
- We have a search warrant.
- Can I get dressed?

01:20:42.631 --> 01:20:44.341
I'm a French citizen.

01:20:47.844 --> 01:20:49.638
Someone from the consulate
will be here soon.

01:20:52.682 --> 01:20:54.476
You have the right to remain silent

01:20:54.601 --> 01:20:55.602
until he arrives.

01:20:55.727 --> 01:20:57.395
I have nothing to hide.

01:20:58.355 --> 01:21:00.106
What do you want from me?

01:21:05.570 --> 01:21:08.657
You've begun executing the will,
haven't you?

01:21:08.782 --> 01:21:10.617
Yes. So?

01:21:13.578 --> 01:21:15.872
Your ex-husband was very wealthy.

01:21:15.997 --> 01:21:17.582
Yes.

01:21:20.961 --> 01:21:22.837
That's all, thank you.

01:21:35.058 --> 01:21:38.436
We've received word your husband
did not die of natural causes.

01:21:39.104 --> 01:21:40.605
What do you mean?

01:21:43.066 --> 01:21:45.402
Someone helped him.

01:21:51.491 --> 01:21:54.327
We have proof you were
in Poland the day he died.

01:21:57.414 --> 01:22:01.293
The stamp is in your passport.
How is that?

01:22:01.418 --> 01:22:03.378
He's not dead. He's alive.

01:22:05.130 --> 01:22:07.299
- Who is?
- My husband.

01:22:14.139 --> 01:22:17.642
Then whose burial did you attend
yesterday at 11:30?

01:22:19.227 --> 01:22:20.812
His.

01:22:22.814 --> 01:22:24.482
Then who's alive?

01:22:28.445 --> 01:22:29.988
No one.

01:22:33.491 --> 01:22:36.911
Madame, I'm Monsieur Le Gac
from the consulate.

01:22:37.454 --> 01:22:39.247
Gentlemen...

01:24:12.674 --> 01:24:14.592
So what's new?

01:24:15.885 --> 01:24:18.346
Don't stand at the window.

01:24:18.471 --> 01:24:20.473
Someone will see you again.

01:24:22.934 --> 01:24:24.477
It's ready.

01:24:34.404 --> 01:24:36.114
What?

01:24:36.448 --> 01:24:41.369
I'm remembering how we identified you
after the exhumation.

01:24:41.953 --> 01:24:44.038
Boy, did we identify you!

01:24:44.289 --> 01:24:46.166
Mikołaj puked.

01:24:47.459 --> 01:24:50.795
Good thing you didn't turn yourself in.
We'd all be in jail:

01:24:50.962 --> 01:24:55.633
you, me, Mikołaj, your driver,
and quite a few others.

01:24:59.137 --> 01:25:02.974
I made some cherry jam.
Will you take that along?

01:25:05.477 --> 01:25:08.730
Maybe one day I'll make a stew

01:25:08.855 --> 01:25:10.857
with snails from the garden.

01:25:12.776 --> 01:25:15.403
- Was the lawyer here?
- Yes.

01:25:15.612 --> 01:25:17.655
He charges a pretty penny.

01:25:17.781 --> 01:25:19.449
He said —

01:25:23.870 --> 01:25:25.205
What?

01:25:28.208 --> 01:25:31.211
That he sees some light
at the end of the tunnel.
