WEBVTT

00:07.007 --> 00:08.801
Stop!

00:10.052 --> 00:12.430
Get back here!

00:15.015 --> 00:17.017
Where'd they go?

00:17.101 --> 00:19.478
You see 'em?

00:19.562 --> 00:21.897
Over here! Come on!

00:34.493 --> 00:35.619
Eyes open, lads!

00:35.703 --> 00:37.747
Quickly, men!
They went this way!

00:41.667 --> 00:44.170
Come on. They can't be far.

00:50.760 --> 00:54.764
Oh, man,
being bad is so exciting.

01:02.188 --> 01:04.440
Ooh, crime doesn't pay,

01:04.440 --> 01:06.859
but it is entertaining.

02:16.762 --> 02:19.390
No!

02:19.390 --> 02:21.892
Uh, we weren't breaking in
or anything.

02:21.976 --> 02:24.603
Just, you know,
sort of on the run.

02:24.687 --> 02:27.857
A quick stop at your store
on our way out of town.

02:27.898 --> 02:29.775
While it was closed.

02:29.859 --> 02:32.361
I assume you were going
to leave an IOU?

02:32.361 --> 02:34.405
- Uh...
- Hmm.

02:34.405 --> 02:36.740
Of course, darling. You know us.

02:36.824 --> 02:40.035
All too well.

02:42.830 --> 02:44.498
Dagger, dagger,

02:44.582 --> 02:46.584
dagger... wooden stake.

02:46.584 --> 02:48.294
Perfect.

02:49.837 --> 02:51.505
I'll take
these enchanted arrows.

02:51.589 --> 02:54.049
And as much garlic
as you can spare.

02:54.133 --> 02:55.968
Ugh. I don't want to know.

02:55.968 --> 02:58.804
No, that's a lie.
I absolutely want to know.

02:58.888 --> 03:00.389
What's this all about?

03:00.389 --> 03:02.141
We kind of pissed off a vampire.

03:02.141 --> 03:03.893
And our healer's
out of commission.

03:03.893 --> 03:07.730
Mm. Then may I suggest the
addition of something special?

03:07.730 --> 03:09.148
Holy water.

03:09.148 --> 03:13.235
One of the only things
truly known to stop a vampire.

03:13.319 --> 03:15.404
Well, that and direct sunlight.

03:15.404 --> 03:17.907
We will take
all the holy water you've got.

03:17.907 --> 03:20.951
You're looking at it.

03:21.035 --> 03:23.120
I'll need to grab
a few more things, then.

03:23.120 --> 03:24.538
Oh!

03:24.622 --> 03:27.750
Thank you, Rodrigo.
You're a gem.

03:27.750 --> 03:29.960
One must have a bit of company

03:30.044 --> 03:32.963
while handsome half-elves
are off thwarting evil.

03:34.632 --> 03:37.968
I'll bet you say that
to all the fugitives.

03:38.052 --> 03:39.803
Oh.

03:39.887 --> 03:43.265
- Uh, um...
- You mentioned direct sunlight.

03:43.349 --> 03:44.683
Oh, yes.

03:44.767 --> 03:48.437
But you need more sunlight
than summer in Marquet.

03:48.437 --> 03:50.648
Well, that seems unlikely.
By the way,

03:50.648 --> 03:53.484
I don't think I have to mention
that we were never here?

03:53.484 --> 03:55.277
It'll be our little secret.

03:56.904 --> 03:58.906
Need some help, love?

03:58.906 --> 04:01.325
I'm fine.
Thanks.

04:01.325 --> 04:04.119
I... It's okay.
I'll just stay this way.

04:04.203 --> 04:05.579
For forever.

04:05.663 --> 04:09.458
Press the tooth of each snake
at the same time, dear.

04:14.922 --> 04:16.256
Ah, cool.

04:16.340 --> 04:18.634
Thanks, Vax.

04:19.677 --> 04:21.637
Uh...

04:21.637 --> 04:24.223
Wonder what we have over here.

04:24.223 --> 04:27.393
Oh. Speaking of secrets...

04:27.393 --> 04:28.769
- Sir Gilmore.
- Hmm?

04:28.769 --> 04:31.897
For your friends, how much
is this going to run us?

04:31.981 --> 04:34.066
Hmm.

04:34.066 --> 04:37.236
Oi! Slow asses!

04:37.236 --> 04:39.196
Check it out.
We got a good deal on the cart.

04:39.321 --> 04:42.574
Practically, literally a steal.
How'd you do?

04:42.658 --> 04:44.827
Let's just say I'd hate to see
what Gilmore charges

04:44.827 --> 04:46.620
- his enemies.
- Hyah!

04:49.957 --> 04:52.584
♪ ♪

05:05.055 --> 05:07.975
Please stop that.
I'm trying to concentrate.

05:07.975 --> 05:09.643
Oh, is that what you're doing?

05:09.727 --> 05:11.979
I thought you were practicing
your resting bitch face.

05:11.979 --> 05:15.482
Excuse me. My bitch face?

05:15.566 --> 05:18.694
You're heading home.
Figured you'd look happier.

05:18.694 --> 05:21.113
This isn't a homecoming.
This is a suicide mission

05:21.113 --> 05:24.408
to topple the necromantic
murderers of my family.

05:24.408 --> 05:27.786
And for the record,
I have a magnificent bitch face.

05:27.870 --> 05:30.247
- Do you, now?
- Yes, I do.

05:30.247 --> 05:32.875
Lots of practice.

05:32.875 --> 05:34.877
Any luck translating?

05:34.877 --> 05:36.295
Uh, totally.

05:36.295 --> 05:37.671
Uh, some.

05:37.755 --> 05:39.882
Okay, yeah,
most of it's impossible.

05:39.882 --> 05:41.800
But, I mean, look at this.

05:41.884 --> 05:43.802
This is some messed-up shit.

05:43.886 --> 05:46.638
I-I mean...
all I can make out is one word

05:46.722 --> 05:48.766
of Delilah's
craptastic scribble.

05:48.766 --> 05:50.434
Something called...

05:50.434 --> 05:52.436
a "zippertwat."

05:52.436 --> 05:56.190
Uh, okay, yeah, actually,
I think it's a ziggurat.

05:56.190 --> 05:57.483
Oh. Thank God.

05:57.483 --> 05:59.735
'Cause what I
was picturing was, like...

05:59.735 --> 06:01.779
- whoa.
- They spent hours

06:01.779 --> 06:04.156
teaching me stuff like this
for my Aramenté.

06:04.156 --> 06:06.158
Ziggurats were
ancient structures

06:06.158 --> 06:08.160
used for contacting gods.

06:08.160 --> 06:09.536
Huh.

06:09.620 --> 06:11.955
Wish I could help more,
but I fell asleep a lot

06:12.039 --> 06:13.373
in Ancient Abyssal class.

06:13.457 --> 06:15.751
Hmm. Then we're
hopelessly fucked.

06:15.751 --> 06:18.962
We definitely are.

06:27.012 --> 06:30.766
Oh, please tell me you're not
shitting in another cart.

06:30.766 --> 06:32.434
It's not working.

06:32.518 --> 06:34.728
- It's too hard.
- Grog,

06:34.812 --> 06:36.563
are you crying?

06:36.647 --> 06:39.024
No.

06:39.108 --> 06:42.111
Pike said I can talk to her
even if she's not here

06:42.111 --> 06:43.403
and I'd feel her.

06:43.487 --> 06:45.739
- But it doesn't work.
- Hey.

06:45.823 --> 06:48.283
Hey, hey, hey.
Pike is going to be fine.

06:48.367 --> 06:49.576
I know that.

06:49.660 --> 06:51.662
She's stronger than all of us.

06:51.662 --> 06:54.623
I'm more worried
about us without her.

06:58.919 --> 07:01.171
Me, too, Grog.

07:01.255 --> 07:02.840
<i>Me, too.</i>

07:13.350 --> 07:15.394
The Whispered One?

07:33.120 --> 07:35.164
Percy, you need a break.

07:35.164 --> 07:37.416
Absolutely not.

07:37.416 --> 07:39.084
We need to keep moving.

07:39.168 --> 07:42.546
The Briarwoods are probably back
in Whitestone by now.

07:47.092 --> 07:50.137
- Percy, stop.
- I'm not that tired.

07:50.137 --> 07:52.681
No, I mean stop the damn cart.

07:52.681 --> 07:56.351
- Something's tracking us.
- Whoa.

08:01.148 --> 08:03.150
Uh, what was that?

08:17.706 --> 08:18.707
- Hmm?
- Hmm?

08:18.707 --> 08:20.751
Oh, poor little puppers.

08:22.044 --> 08:23.670
Are you hurt, little guy?

08:38.477 --> 08:40.562
What the fuck are those?

08:41.772 --> 08:43.607
A gift from Lady Briarwood.

08:51.198 --> 08:52.157
What the fu...?

08:57.371 --> 08:58.455
Scanlan!

09:01.792 --> 09:03.502
Hyah!

09:43.542 --> 09:44.751
Mmm.

09:44.835 --> 09:47.170
Scanlan, hang on!

09:49.798 --> 09:51.508
Come on, Percy! Faster! Hyah!

09:51.508 --> 09:53.552
This thing was not
built for speed.

09:53.552 --> 09:55.345
And did you just "hyah" me?

09:55.429 --> 09:57.306
- Hyah.
- Hyah.

09:59.308 --> 10:01.226
That's just not fair.

10:04.730 --> 10:06.315
I'll take the big one!

10:06.315 --> 10:07.983
I'll take the other big one!

10:12.738 --> 10:15.949
Sit!

10:18.994 --> 10:20.829
Vax!

10:32.883 --> 10:34.217
That's for Pike!

10:34.301 --> 10:36.386
And me and maybe Scanlan

10:36.470 --> 10:38.889
'cause he probably
won't survive!

10:41.141 --> 10:43.060
This better be worth it.

10:50.442 --> 10:52.152
Thanks, Gilmore.

10:54.780 --> 10:55.781
Um, are they going
over the cliff?

10:55.781 --> 10:57.324
They're not the only ones!

10:57.324 --> 10:59.034
It's got Scanlan.
We have no choice!

10:59.034 --> 11:01.244
I am not dying to save
that gnome. Get me closer!

11:05.374 --> 11:07.918
Shoot for its head!
Neck! Dick!

11:07.918 --> 11:10.170
Come on, Vex! No one
breaks balls better than you!

11:10.170 --> 11:12.172
He's not wrong.

11:13.215 --> 11:16.218
You missed?!

11:17.761 --> 11:19.805
Let go of the book, dumbass!

11:23.100 --> 11:24.810
Hyah!

11:24.810 --> 11:26.561
Off the cart!

11:45.497 --> 11:47.582
No.

11:49.042 --> 11:51.086
Scanlan.

11:51.086 --> 11:53.380
He didn't make it.

11:59.052 --> 12:02.222
<i>Rise, mighty Scanlan ♪</i>

12:02.222 --> 12:05.642
<i>Rise! ♪</i>♪

12:07.978 --> 12:09.896
Yeah, when I die,

12:09.980 --> 12:11.690
it'll be the way
the gods intended--

12:11.690 --> 12:14.025
choked to death
by a disgruntled pimp.

12:14.109 --> 12:17.446
Careful what you wish for.

12:18.488 --> 12:20.574
We lost everything.

12:20.574 --> 12:24.703
Well, I mean, at least we still
have our holy water-er-er-er...

12:24.703 --> 12:26.371
No! No!

12:32.586 --> 12:34.045
Perfect.

12:55.984 --> 12:59.863
She got what she wanted. Again.

13:03.283 --> 13:05.911
Well, do you have
an update for us?

13:05.911 --> 13:07.662
My Lady, the refinement

13:07.746 --> 13:10.415
of the Whitestone shale
is on track

13:10.499 --> 13:12.667
and will be ready
at your request.

13:12.751 --> 13:14.711
Excellent.

13:14.711 --> 13:19.299
We have a schedule to keep, but
the residuum needs to be pure.

13:19.299 --> 13:20.884
Do not forget that,
Professor Anders.

13:20.884 --> 13:22.594
Understood, My Lady.

13:22.594 --> 13:24.930
Everything for the ritual
must be in place before the...

13:24.930 --> 13:26.932
Lord and Lady,

13:26.932 --> 13:31.353
the dinner guests you requested.

13:31.353 --> 13:33.480
Ah, splendid.

13:33.480 --> 13:37.067
Welcome, friends.

13:37.067 --> 13:40.237
Supper first,
then you'll need to change

13:40.237 --> 13:43.615
- into more formal attire.
- Oh? Oh.

13:43.615 --> 13:45.200
Oh, my goodness.

13:45.200 --> 13:48.036
Excuse me, did we win a prize?

13:48.036 --> 13:49.996
Yes, little one.

13:50.080 --> 13:53.833
You've been chosen
for a very special event.

14:08.223 --> 14:10.392
That's far enough
for today.

14:10.392 --> 14:12.602
Let's make camp.

14:17.357 --> 14:19.734
Hmm. Hmm.

14:22.821 --> 14:24.406
Oops! Little too much.

14:26.074 --> 14:29.035
Oh, my gosh. Oh, sorry!
Sorry, sorry, sorry!

14:29.119 --> 14:31.079
You're fine. You're fine.
No worries.

14:31.079 --> 14:32.831
Yeah, no worries.

14:32.831 --> 14:34.833
You'll probably get your shit
together eventually.

14:40.130 --> 14:42.048
Huh,
see here. Ah.

14:42.132 --> 14:44.968
Okay, let's see
what this baby can do.

14:44.968 --> 14:46.886
You got a baby in that thing?

14:46.970 --> 14:49.514
What? N-No. Grog,
it's the scroll I picked up

14:49.598 --> 14:51.099
from Brimscythe's cave.

14:51.099 --> 14:52.934
Just got to figure out
how to make it work.

14:53.018 --> 14:54.603
Okay.

14:54.603 --> 14:59.274
<i>"Nevosh, nevonn, klu, mehon."</i>

15:03.612 --> 15:06.531
It made you handsomer!

15:06.615 --> 15:09.618
Oh, I like it!

15:09.618 --> 15:12.829
<i>Nevosh, nevonn, klu, mehon.</i>

15:12.829 --> 15:14.623
Whoa-ho-ho!

15:14.623 --> 15:16.458
I like that even more!

15:16.458 --> 15:17.917
<i>Nevosh, nevonn, klu, mehon.</i>

15:18.001 --> 15:19.794
Whoa. Yup.

15:19.878 --> 15:22.756
Now I'm confused and aroused.

15:22.756 --> 15:24.966
Dah-dah-dah-dah-dah-dah-dah.
Hands off.

15:25.050 --> 15:28.053
What the...? How the fuck...

15:28.053 --> 15:31.306
do I look this good?

15:31.306 --> 15:33.391
Hmm?

15:37.896 --> 15:41.191
This forest reminds me
of home a little.

15:43.777 --> 15:46.237
Your home
must be nice.

15:46.321 --> 15:49.824
It's beautiful. And big.

15:49.908 --> 15:52.994
And filled with Ashari
I'm supposed to lead someday.

15:53.078 --> 15:55.372
Vex is right.

15:55.372 --> 15:58.083
Maybe I'll never get
my shit together.

15:58.083 --> 16:00.960
Don't listen to my sister.

16:01.044 --> 16:04.255
I don't know your people

16:04.339 --> 16:07.384
or rituals or what you think
you're running from.

16:07.384 --> 16:08.927
But I know you.

16:08.927 --> 16:10.845
I know you care about others.

16:10.929 --> 16:12.972
That's what makes
a great leader.

16:14.808 --> 16:18.311
Kiki, I believe in you.

16:18.395 --> 16:21.064
Thanks...

16:21.064 --> 16:23.108
friend.

16:46.715 --> 16:48.591
Yes? How may I be of service?

16:48.675 --> 16:50.719
I...

16:50.719 --> 16:53.847
I need the Everlight, but...

16:53.847 --> 16:56.516
Are you all right, my child?

16:56.516 --> 16:58.643
I guess...

16:58.727 --> 17:01.354
Well, the thing is...

17:01.438 --> 17:04.232
I was helping my friends
battle a-a dark mage,

17:04.232 --> 17:06.401
and she cracked my holy symbol,
and I haven't been able

17:06.401 --> 17:08.278
to connect or-or heal
or do anything,

17:08.278 --> 17:10.405
and now I think I'm cursed.

17:11.656 --> 17:14.617
I know. I sound crazy.

17:14.701 --> 17:16.578
A curse, you say?

17:16.578 --> 17:19.956
Help me. Please?

17:19.956 --> 17:22.792
Whatever has happened
to you, child,

17:22.876 --> 17:25.295
the Everlight accepts you
as you are.

17:30.175 --> 17:32.719
<i>[Scanlan]</i> <i>♪ She was a holy,
holy gnome</i> ♪

17:35.472 --> 17:37.098
Oh, God.

17:37.182 --> 17:39.726
How about,
what's the strangest creature

17:39.726 --> 17:41.311
you've ever killed?

17:41.311 --> 17:43.229
Oh, that's easy.

17:43.313 --> 17:48.276
I will return,
and I will find you!

17:49.903 --> 17:52.655
Uh-huh. Heard that before.

17:52.739 --> 17:54.115
Oh!

17:54.199 --> 17:56.534
Yeah. Oh, man, good one.

17:56.618 --> 17:58.244
Yeah, that's pretty crazy.

17:58.328 --> 18:00.872
I think maybe the strangest kill
I've ever had would be...

18:08.671 --> 18:10.173
Oh, no, no, no.
Oh, no, no, no, no.

18:10.173 --> 18:13.176
Shh! Shh! Shh, quiet.
Quiet. Go to sleep.

18:15.512 --> 18:18.473
Pretty dark.

18:18.473 --> 18:21.601
Okay, this one was awesome.

18:21.601 --> 18:24.145
Oh, you...

18:32.070 --> 18:33.738
- Oh!
- That was the best.

18:33.822 --> 18:35.573
Yeah.

18:35.657 --> 18:37.075
Points for originality.

18:37.075 --> 18:38.535
Okay, I've got one.

18:38.535 --> 18:41.830
Hands down, the worst monster
I've ever faced.

18:45.792 --> 18:47.252
So what?

18:47.252 --> 18:49.212
Yeah, sounds pretty normal
for you.

18:49.212 --> 18:51.464
No, no, no, I-I haven't
gotten to the good part.

18:51.548 --> 18:54.342
- Ah! Yes! Yes! Yeah!
- Huh?

18:54.342 --> 18:56.594
Yes!

18:58.513 --> 18:59.639
- Aah!
- Oh!

18:59.639 --> 19:02.058
- Oh, what the fuck?!
- Oh, no!

19:02.058 --> 19:04.143
What? I still finished.

19:06.646 --> 19:09.315
- I'm gonna be sick.
- I'm very consistent.

19:09.399 --> 19:11.150
How about you, Percy?

19:11.234 --> 19:13.820
What's the worst monster
you've ever faced?

19:14.863 --> 19:16.990
They're in Whitestone.

19:16.990 --> 19:19.409
And we'll all
be facing them soon.

19:24.831 --> 19:26.749
Buzzkill.

19:36.301 --> 19:39.220
I keep thinking
about when we left Syngorn.

19:39.304 --> 19:41.890
Hmm. Yeah?

19:41.890 --> 19:43.850
Screw that place.

19:43.850 --> 19:45.476
And Father.

19:45.560 --> 19:47.312
Whole thing nearly broke us.

19:47.312 --> 19:49.689
Nearly.

19:49.689 --> 19:51.858
But it didn't.

19:53.484 --> 19:55.737
Because we stuck together.

19:57.989 --> 20:01.367
We didn't let ourselves
get distracted by pretty things.

20:01.451 --> 20:04.037
Careful, brother.

20:04.037 --> 20:06.122
Those vines have thorns.

20:07.916 --> 20:10.710
You're imagining things, Stubby.

20:10.710 --> 20:14.172
No one will ever
come between us.

20:18.176 --> 20:20.637
You know, sometimes
courage is knowing

20:20.637 --> 20:23.348
there could be trouble
and taking the chance anyway.

20:23.348 --> 20:26.225
So is stupidity.

21:06.808 --> 21:09.560
Almost home.

21:09.644 --> 21:11.396
I never thought
I'd see it again.

21:11.396 --> 21:13.898
What's Whitestone like, Percy?

21:13.982 --> 21:16.150
Yes, what should we expect?

21:16.234 --> 21:18.736
It's beautiful.

21:18.820 --> 21:20.697
<i>Lush.</i>

21:20.697 --> 21:23.199
<i>Orchards always in bloom,</i>

21:23.199 --> 21:25.451
<i>thanks to the Sun Tree.</i>

21:25.535 --> 21:27.453
<i>They say it was planted</i>

21:27.537 --> 21:29.747
<i>by the Dawnfather
a thousand years ago.</i>

21:29.831 --> 21:32.458
<i>It's even engraved here
on our family crest.</i>

21:32.542 --> 21:36.838
A symbol of the De Rolos' ties
to the city.

21:36.838 --> 21:38.965
At least it used to be.

21:43.636 --> 21:46.139
We're going
to help you get it back.

21:46.139 --> 21:47.932
All of it.

21:54.731 --> 21:56.274
We're here.

22:01.320 --> 22:02.655
Percy.

22:02.739 --> 22:04.907
What have they done?

22:04.991 --> 22:07.285


22:09.579 --> 22:11.622
No guards?

22:18.796 --> 22:20.506
Where is everyone?

22:24.302 --> 22:29.265
Uh, no offense, Percy, but your
town's kind of creepy as shit.

22:29.265 --> 22:30.975
I need to find Keeper Yennen.

22:31.059 --> 22:32.727
- Who?
- A holy woman here.

22:32.727 --> 22:34.812
She'll know what's happened.

22:36.314 --> 22:38.274
- You're sure about her?
- She can be trusted.

22:38.274 --> 22:39.942
If she's alive.

22:48.618 --> 22:50.453
Uh, b-big thing there.
There big thing.

22:50.453 --> 22:53.206
We're not safe here. Come on.

22:59.378 --> 23:02.340
Percy, are you okay?

23:18.314 --> 23:20.233
<i>It's us.</i>

24:07.363 --> 24:09.323
Chirp.
