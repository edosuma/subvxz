WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:05.000
If she is indeed
the child of the Gods,

00:05.000 --> 00:08.000
she will lead us into the light.

00:09.000 --> 00:13.000
In betwixt you must pass through
air, fire, water, earth.

00:18.000 --> 00:20.000
When my time came
to walk along the Sacred Wind,

00:20.000 --> 00:25.000
I broke both legs, my pelvis,
my ankle, my jaw, and four fingers.

00:25.000 --> 00:28.000
I was pissing blood for a month.

00:31.000 --> 00:33.000
I had a vision.

00:33.000 --> 00:35.000
-What did you see?
-A thin man.

00:35.000 --> 00:38.000
On his palm there was a symbol.

00:38.000 --> 00:41.000
-Strike it from your mind. Do as I say!
-But, I...

00:41.000 --> 00:44.000
The fisherman who lives at the mouth
of the river has three sons.

00:45.000 --> 00:48.000
-Bring them to me.
-Where is she, boy?

00:48.000 --> 00:49.000
Show me.

00:51.000 --> 00:53.000
This day, I lead another path.

00:53.000 --> 00:56.000
The path to the First Man.

00:56.000 --> 01:00.000
Walk with Veran,
and you walk into the abyss.

01:02.000 --> 01:06.000
I've got something for you.
A mile from here, buried in the ground.

01:06.000 --> 01:08.000
This is my lucky day.

01:08.000 --> 01:11.000
-Where's the girl?
-On the seventh Moon,

01:12.000 --> 01:15.000
she will arrive
on the lands of the Devni.

01:15.000 --> 01:17.000
-Who is the Keeper?
-I do not know her.

01:17.000 --> 01:20.000
But you know one of her kin.

01:20.000 --> 01:23.000
Have you heard about a tribe
in the west...Devni?

01:23.000 --> 01:25.000
I was born there. My sister's queen.

01:25.000 --> 01:29.000
I need to find the girl
before he does.

01:31.000 --> 01:34.000
-What's wrong?
-We must begin.

01:34.000 --> 01:37.000
I need you to help me
pursue my purpose.

01:37.000 --> 01:38.000
Our true purpose.

01:41.000 --> 01:43.000
I'm Queen Amena of the Cantii.

01:44.000 --> 01:46.000
Sister to Queen Andra.

02:00.000 --> 02:03.000
You have faced
the Mighty Earth Mother.

02:03.000 --> 02:06.000
Stared down the Sister Wind.

02:06.000 --> 02:10.000
Now the time has come
to face the Water Goddess.

02:10.000 --> 02:13.000
-When the spring moon wanes...
-I have something to say.

02:17.000 --> 02:20.000
-What are you doing?
-I just wanted to say...

02:21.000 --> 02:24.000
-Thank you.
-What?

02:24.000 --> 02:27.000
I know we haven't always seen
eye to eye.

02:28.000 --> 02:33.000
But I know it's only because of you
that we've come this far.

02:33.000 --> 02:37.000
And I know we have so far left to go,
but, I just wanted you to know...

02:39.000 --> 02:42.000
..I appreciate you so much.

02:42.000 --> 02:44.000
The risks you've taken...

02:46.000 --> 02:51.000
The sacrifices you've made...
I think you're the best.

02:52.000 --> 02:57.000
And you have...
the most amazing eyes.

03:02.000 --> 03:07.000
-We should...
-Yes. We should.

03:28.000 --> 03:30.000
What is it? What's wrong?

03:35.000 --> 03:40.000
-Where are you going?
-Oh, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck...

03:40.000 --> 03:41.000
Fuck!

03:56.000 --> 03:59.000
When I look out my window

04:01.000 --> 04:03.000
Many sights to see

04:05.000 --> 04:08.000
And when I look in my window

04:11.000 --> 04:15.000
So many different people to be

04:15.000 --> 04:17.000
Oh, no

04:17.000 --> 04:22.000
Must be the season of the witch

04:22.000 --> 04:27.000
Must be the season
of the witch, yeah

04:27.000 --> 04:31.000
Must be the season of the witch

04:33.000 --> 04:37.000
You got to pick up every stitch

04:39.000 --> 04:42.000
The rabbits running in the ditch

04:43.000 --> 04:46.000
Beatnicks are out to make it rich

05:08.000 --> 05:11.000
My queen,
please forgive this interruption,

05:11.000 --> 05:13.000
but it's extremely important.

05:16.000 --> 05:18.000
What is it?

05:20.000 --> 05:25.000
-Speak.
-My queen. Your sister is here.

05:27.000 --> 05:29.000
My sister!

05:32.000 --> 05:34.000
Amena!

05:34.000 --> 05:37.000
Sister! Sister!

05:38.000 --> 05:41.000
What brings you here, and alone?
Is all well?

05:41.000 --> 05:43.000
All is well, sister. Most well.

05:44.000 --> 05:46.000
I wanna say so much,
but my tongue won't catch up.

05:46.000 --> 05:49.000
-Slow down!
-I can't believe you're here.

05:52.000 --> 05:53.000
Amena.

05:55.000 --> 05:58.000
Or should I say Queen Amena?

05:59.000 --> 06:00.000
Yes, you should, Aunt Cara.

06:00.000 --> 06:04.000
Tonight we will feast,
to celebrate my sister's return.

06:05.000 --> 06:07.000
Do you not feel, your Majesty,

06:07.000 --> 06:11.000
the time would be better spent
in sacrifice and prayer?

06:11.000 --> 06:16.000
Is it not the Gods we should honor
for this good fortune?

06:16.000 --> 06:19.000
Rather than mere mortals.

06:21.000 --> 06:25.000
Of course, Aunt Cara. We will pray.

06:41.000 --> 06:43.000
I bring news, Queen Mother.

06:44.000 --> 06:48.000
Your daughter, Amena,
has returned to us.

07:00.000 --> 07:01.000
Amena!

07:10.000 --> 07:12.000
Warm work.

07:18.000 --> 07:20.000
What?

07:28.000 --> 07:30.000
Is everything all right?

07:30.000 --> 07:32.000
I've been thinking...

07:33.000 --> 07:36.000
I think you should sleep outside.

07:37.000 --> 07:40.000
I'll build you a small,
but waterproof shelter out there.

07:40.000 --> 07:43.000
-Why?
-It's perfectly safe.

07:43.000 --> 07:45.000
But why?

07:49.000 --> 07:52.000
It will bring you closer to nature,
the moon, the stars...

07:52.000 --> 07:56.000
-Both are very important in your...
-What if it rains?

07:56.000 --> 07:59.000
I know how to build a shelter.
It will be waterproof.

08:00.000 --> 08:02.000
-But you can't...
-It's decided.

08:17.000 --> 08:21.000
All praise to the mighty Gods,
who have brought our sister home,

08:21.000 --> 08:23.000
on the wind.

08:25.000 --> 08:28.000
Thanks for this holy blessing.

08:32.000 --> 08:34.000
All praise to the mighty Gods,

08:34.000 --> 08:37.000
for returning me safe to this place...

08:38.000 --> 08:40.000
..and to my beloved sister.

08:42.000 --> 08:45.000
My beautiful, beautiful sister.

08:46.000 --> 08:50.000
Who I have missed more than anyone,
or anything...

09:03.000 --> 09:05.000
Do you even know your heart?

09:11.000 --> 09:12.000
Have you seen it?

09:17.000 --> 09:20.000
Well, well. The whore returns.

09:22.000 --> 09:24.000
The Cantii are slaves to Rome.

09:25.000 --> 09:28.000
She's drunk poison.

09:28.000 --> 09:30.000
Now she comes to poison us.

09:33.000 --> 09:38.000
You have faced the Mighty Earth Mother.
Stared down the Sister Wind.

09:38.000 --> 09:41.000
Now the time has come
to face the Water Goddess.

09:41.000 --> 09:45.000
When the spring moon wanes,
you must give yourself to the river.

09:50.000 --> 09:52.000
Strip to your skin,
swallow the holy herbs,

09:52.000 --> 09:56.000
and become as one with Sister Water.
Any questions?

09:56.000 --> 09:59.000
-Is everything all right?
-What?

09:59.000 --> 10:01.000
You're sweating.

10:01.000 --> 10:03.000
-No, I'm not.
-You look weird.

10:03.000 --> 10:07.000
-Do you need to sit down?
-Everything is fine. Nothing's weird.

10:16.000 --> 10:18.000
We should prepare.

10:36.000 --> 10:38.000
Did you hear, my love?

10:40.000 --> 10:42.000
Our little girl has returned.

10:45.000 --> 10:47.000
Our little girl...

10:49.000 --> 10:51.000
How is your husband, Phelan?

10:52.000 --> 10:55.000
When King Pellenor died,
Phelan abandoned the Cantii.

10:57.000 --> 11:00.000
-Abandoned?
-Veran chose his sister to rule.

11:00.000 --> 11:02.000
And what happened to the sister?

11:02.000 --> 11:05.000
Kerra was weak. The people hated her.

11:07.000 --> 11:09.000
How can that be
when it was Veran who chose her?

11:09.000 --> 11:12.000
She was indeed chosen by the Gods.

11:12.000 --> 11:14.000
But that's just a seed
for greatness to grow.

11:14.000 --> 11:16.000
We choose our own paths.

11:22.000 --> 11:24.000
And then the Gods chose you.

11:27.000 --> 11:29.000
For that I am so happy.

11:42.000 --> 11:44.000
Slower.

11:46.000 --> 11:47.000
Too slow.

11:50.000 --> 11:52.000
Slightly faster. Faster.

11:54.000 --> 11:58.000
That's it. Faster. Slightly faster.

12:00.000 --> 12:01.000
Faster.

12:06.000 --> 12:09.000
That's it. Faster.

12:10.000 --> 12:13.000
That's it. That's it.
Just keep it there.

12:13.000 --> 12:17.000
That's it. That's it. Keep it there.

12:23.000 --> 12:25.000
Have you finished? Good.

13:07.000 --> 13:09.000
Sorry.

13:27.000 --> 13:32.000
Thank you Spirit of the River.
Spirit of the Raging Seas.

13:50.000 --> 13:53.000
-Thank you.
-Shut up.

14:18.000 --> 14:21.000
There. You're ready.

14:35.000 --> 14:39.000
You've heard, I'm sure, that the Cantii
have made peace with Rome.

14:41.000 --> 14:44.000
We are so far from the world here.

14:44.000 --> 14:47.000
We hear many things.
Who knows what to believe?

14:49.000 --> 14:53.000
It's true. It was I who struck the pact.

14:58.000 --> 14:59.000
So this is why you came.

15:00.000 --> 15:02.000
For years you stayed away.

15:02.000 --> 15:05.000
-With no explanation. But now...
-Sister, please, listen...

15:06.000 --> 15:08.000
Some say that's the last thing
I should do.

15:08.000 --> 15:11.000
The world is changing.
I've watched it change.

15:12.000 --> 15:16.000
I've watched King Pellenor
refuse to even speak with the Romans.

15:16.000 --> 15:19.000
That same moon, I watched his guts
glisten on the ground.

15:19.000 --> 15:24.000
You're forgetting it was the Gods
who decided Pellenor's fate.

15:24.000 --> 15:29.000
Was it? I was there.
I saw what happened.

15:30.000 --> 15:32.000
Sister, come here.

15:33.000 --> 15:35.000
I want to tell you something.

15:43.000 --> 15:46.000
When I was chosen to be the Keeper,

15:47.000 --> 15:49.000
Veran told me of a prophecy.

15:50.000 --> 15:53.000
A demon will come to these lands,

15:55.000 --> 15:57.000
join forces with the dark,

15:58.000 --> 16:01.000
and the Age of the Druids
will be at an end.

16:01.000 --> 16:03.000
-Andra...
-There remains one hope.

16:03.000 --> 16:08.000
A maiden. Who, if she pleases the Gods,
may save us.

16:13.000 --> 16:17.000
This is a time to look forward.
Not backwards to prophecy.

16:22.000 --> 16:24.000
You doubt the word of Veran.

16:26.000 --> 16:28.000
-You always did.
-Andra...

16:28.000 --> 16:33.000
I have seen the signs, visions.

16:34.000 --> 16:37.000
-They tell me the Demon is here.
-Rome is the future.

16:37.000 --> 16:40.000
It's our only hope.
Not some maiden in a prophecy.

16:40.000 --> 16:44.000
All I know is that the demon is here.

16:45.000 --> 16:47.000
And a maiden is coming.

16:54.000 --> 16:57.000
-Let me pass.
-The queen is with her sister.

17:09.000 --> 17:11.000
Andra, please listen to me.

17:16.000 --> 17:19.000
Andra, it's time to talk sense, sister.

17:19.000 --> 17:23.000
There are those in the Council
of Elders who've made these arguments.

17:23.000 --> 17:27.000
And as many who would sooner die
than pay one copper piece to Rome.

17:27.000 --> 17:30.000
-Aunt Cara.
-She is beloved to me.

17:30.000 --> 17:33.000
-And her faith is strong.
-Cara controls you, Andra.

17:38.000 --> 17:42.000
You've been gone a long time.
You do not know how things are now.

17:43.000 --> 17:46.000
Forgive me, sister,
but you are Queen of the Cantii.

17:46.000 --> 17:48.000
This is no longer your tribe.

17:48.000 --> 17:52.000
If there's discord in your council,
it must be resolved.

17:52.000 --> 17:54.000
You must gather them,
and have this out.

17:54.000 --> 17:57.000
How am I to attend such a council
when I myself am undecided?

17:58.000 --> 18:01.000
I will be there. I will help you.

18:01.000 --> 18:04.000
But never forget,
it is you who has absolute power.

18:04.000 --> 18:07.000
Not Cara. Not the council. You.

18:07.000 --> 18:09.000
The Gods chose you, Andra.

18:12.000 --> 18:14.000
Just as they chose me.

18:20.000 --> 18:22.000
You're right.

18:23.000 --> 18:26.000
The times are changing. But know this.

18:29.000 --> 18:33.000
However much I love you, look up to you,

18:34.000 --> 18:37.000
you will never turn me
against the Druids.

18:39.000 --> 18:41.000
Veran is my light.

18:41.000 --> 18:43.000
It was he who made me Keeper.

18:44.000 --> 18:46.000
I protect the Lake of Tears

18:48.000 --> 18:49.000
and nothing...

18:50.000 --> 18:55.000
no-one, not even you,
will ever change that.

18:57.000 --> 19:01.000
I must be here,
for when the maiden comes.

19:01.000 --> 19:06.000
It is I who will anoint her in the lake.

19:10.000 --> 19:14.000
I must consider all you have told me.

19:14.000 --> 19:17.000
And ask the Gods which path to take.

19:22.000 --> 19:24.000
There.

19:34.000 --> 19:37.000
You can smell the wind, the fire.

19:39.000 --> 19:42.000
Earth. It's perfect.

19:46.000 --> 19:50.000
So, good night.

20:20.000 --> 20:23.000
The chosen one. The chosen one.

20:58.000 --> 21:00.000
What is your name, boy?

21:03.000 --> 21:05.000
My name...

21:08.000 --> 21:09.000
You know what to do.

21:11.000 --> 21:13.000
...is Love.

21:36.000 --> 21:37.000
Fuck this.

21:54.000 --> 21:57.000
-What are you doing here?
-"I can build a shelter."

21:57.000 --> 22:00.000
-This is my area. Leave my area.
-"It'll be waterproof."

22:00.000 --> 22:03.000
-Leave my area.
-I'm freezing.

22:03.000 --> 22:06.000
Leave... I command you to leave my area!

22:06.000 --> 22:09.000
-Fuck off!
-Right now.

22:09.000 --> 22:10.000
Cold.

22:13.000 --> 22:17.000
-It's a test. The Gods are testing me.
-What are you on about?

22:19.000 --> 22:22.000
Fine. If you won't sleep out there,
I will.

22:39.000 --> 22:42.000
Move over.
Go over there, in the corner.

22:42.000 --> 22:44.000
-I want to be by the fire.
-In the corner.

22:44.000 --> 22:46.000
I'm freezing.

22:48.000 --> 22:50.000
There, then. You go lie there.

22:55.000 --> 22:59.000
Slightly further. You... A bit...
I said here.

23:05.000 --> 23:07.000
Jeez.

23:17.000 --> 23:19.000
-What?
-I see.

23:20.000 --> 23:24.000
-What do you see?
-Nothing.

23:24.000 --> 23:27.000
Good. Because there is nothing to see.
Stop smiling.

23:31.000 --> 23:34.000
What? What's funny?

23:34.000 --> 23:37.000
-Nothing's funny.
-Exactly.

24:01.000 --> 24:03.000
Amena...

24:04.000 --> 24:06.000
She came home.

24:07.000 --> 24:09.000
Now the Gods will punish her...

24:13.000 --> 24:15.000
Because of what you did.

24:38.000 --> 24:41.000
-Sister.
-I will summon the elders.

24:43.000 --> 24:46.000
When the prophecy says
the maiden will become a fish,

24:46.000 --> 24:48.000
what do you think that means?

24:49.000 --> 24:53.000
-It means you will become a fish.
-Right.

24:54.000 --> 24:58.000
For one moon, you will journey
through the rivers and streams,

24:58.000 --> 25:00.000
and you will find the path.

25:00.000 --> 25:03.000
-The path which leads to...
-A fish.

25:03.000 --> 25:07.000
-Exactly.
-But not actually...

25:07.000 --> 25:10.000
Actually.
You will actually become a fish.

25:10.000 --> 25:14.000
You mean the same way
I "actually" became a bird?

25:15.000 --> 25:17.000
The Trial of the Wind
is a trial of faith.

25:17.000 --> 25:20.000
-You believed and survived.
-Just.

25:20.000 --> 25:22.000
If you are the True Maiden,

25:22.000 --> 25:25.000
then during
the Trial of Great Sister Water,

25:25.000 --> 25:28.000
the Prophecy of Veran states
you will be transformed into a fish.

25:29.000 --> 25:31.000
Swim up, or perhaps downstream,

25:31.000 --> 25:34.000
and lead us in the direction
of the Lake of Tears.

25:34.000 --> 25:37.000
Whilst not falling
into the arms of the eagle.

25:37.000 --> 25:40.000
You have a problem,
take it up with Veran.

25:40.000 --> 25:42.000
He devised the prophecy. Not me.

25:49.000 --> 25:51.000
Have you ever had a wife?

25:51.000 --> 25:53.000
-Unbelievable.
-Do Druids have wives?

25:56.000 --> 25:59.000
The Druids have four wives.

25:59.000 --> 26:04.000
-Don't tell me. The Earth. The Wind.
-The Fire and The Water.

26:04.000 --> 26:08.000
They're not wives, are they?
Not actual wives.

26:09.000 --> 26:12.000
What... What exactly are you asking?

26:12.000 --> 26:16.000
If you mean do Druids fuck,
the answer is "all the time."

26:16.000 --> 26:18.000
When Druids aren't praying or fasting,

26:18.000 --> 26:21.000
it's a safe bet to assume
they're fucking each other.

26:21.000 --> 26:23.000
There. Happy?

26:26.000 --> 26:29.000
I, however, was an Ovate.

26:31.000 --> 26:33.000
An Ovate is forbidden such practices.

26:33.000 --> 26:35.000
So you weren't allowed to...

26:35.000 --> 26:38.000
It was never an issue. I was devout.

26:39.000 --> 26:42.000
What about after they threw you out?
Then you could do what you want.

26:47.000 --> 26:51.000
You're right. I could do as I pleased.

26:51.000 --> 26:55.000
-Except you're forgetting one thing.
-What's that?

26:56.000 --> 27:00.000
I was thrown out of the Druids
because I was possessed

27:00.000 --> 27:02.000
by the snake demon, Pwykka!

27:02.000 --> 27:06.000
That's not exactly something you wish
to bring into a relationship.

27:06.000 --> 27:09.000
That, let me tell you, is baggage.

27:10.000 --> 27:12.000
So you're a virgin?

27:14.000 --> 27:16.000
Here's how it works.

27:16.000 --> 27:20.000
The teacher asks the questions.
The novice answers them.

27:20.000 --> 27:24.000
Tomorrow at sunset,
you will be asking the Gods a question.

27:24.000 --> 27:26.000
"Do I have the strength,
wisdom and knowledge

27:26.000 --> 27:28.000
to pass into the seventh plane?"

27:28.000 --> 27:32.000
And they will say,
"No, you little ninny,

27:32.000 --> 27:36.000
because you were up all night
asking stupid questions!"

28:03.000 --> 28:07.000
We can play games. Ask silly questions.

28:08.000 --> 28:11.000
Let in the frivolous,
you let in weakness.

28:11.000 --> 28:14.000
The powers at work
will find that weakness

28:14.000 --> 28:16.000
and they will strike.

28:16.000 --> 28:18.000
They will show no mercy.

28:19.000 --> 28:24.000
And then, all will be lost.

28:30.000 --> 28:32.000
What is it?

28:43.000 --> 28:44.000
Divis.

28:47.000 --> 28:49.000
Are you okay?

28:55.000 --> 29:00.000
The events of the past 20 moons
have cast fear across this land.

29:01.000 --> 29:05.000
But I have seen with my own eyes,

29:05.000 --> 29:09.000
what happens when Rome
is resisted without consideration.

29:10.000 --> 29:12.000
Rome smells weakness like a wolf.

29:13.000 --> 29:16.000
Its boots march on half the world
because of this.

29:17.000 --> 29:20.000
My own once proud house of Cantii...

29:21.000 --> 29:23.000
For one reason.

29:24.000 --> 29:28.000
When Roman fists
beat at our strong gates,

29:28.000 --> 29:30.000
what stood behind them
was not united.

29:32.000 --> 29:35.000
Those same drums will
one day beat outside your gates.

29:35.000 --> 29:38.000
Asking the same question.
The only question.

29:38.000 --> 29:42.000
Who stands within? Equals? Or slaves?

29:43.000 --> 29:46.000
This is how we protect our ways.

29:48.000 --> 29:50.000
It's the only way.

30:11.000 --> 30:15.000
Turn around and leave
or I will end this.

30:17.000 --> 30:20.000
I come to speak with the Keeper.

30:34.000 --> 30:37.000
Get your things.
We're leaving for the river.

30:37.000 --> 30:39.000
Sunset isn't for hours.
Can't we stay till then?

30:40.000 --> 30:41.000
It's not safe here.

30:44.000 --> 30:46.000
Not anymore.

30:55.000 --> 30:56.000
The Dead Man has woken.

30:59.000 --> 31:03.000
It's just time before the Dead Man
and Lokka strike their pact.

31:06.000 --> 31:09.000
-My powers are waning.
-Veran.

31:09.000 --> 31:12.000
Listen to me.

31:13.000 --> 31:17.000
Many have turned their heads
from the Veran.

31:17.000 --> 31:20.000
Lured into darkness by the dark itself.

31:36.000 --> 31:38.000
They've sworn their allegiance
to the Dead Man.

31:40.000 --> 31:44.000
He will soon join forces with Lokka
and take these lands.

32:01.000 --> 32:07.000
But there is worse to tell.
The walls of have already been breached.

32:07.000 --> 32:12.000
Phelan. Phelan, it's me, Ania.

32:13.000 --> 32:16.000
There is one here on Rome's business.

32:18.000 --> 32:20.000
She does Lokka's work.

32:24.000 --> 32:27.000
My sister would never do such a thing.
The Gods know it.

32:27.000 --> 32:30.000
It was not the Gods
who made your sister queen.

32:33.000 --> 32:35.000
Then who was it?

32:49.000 --> 32:51.000
Hello, child.

32:55.000 --> 32:57.000
It's been a long time.

33:28.000 --> 33:30.000
Forgive me.

33:31.000 --> 33:34.000
No! Sister.

33:34.000 --> 33:36.000
You will die for this betrayal.

33:36.000 --> 33:38.000
You're making a mistake.

33:41.000 --> 33:43.000
The time has come, brother.

33:45.000 --> 33:47.000
Make your play.

33:50.000 --> 33:52.000
Make your play.

33:59.000 --> 34:02.000
Phelan. Phelan!

34:05.000 --> 34:07.000
It's Ania.

34:08.000 --> 34:13.000
We both serve the Dead Man.
All else is nothing.

34:15.000 --> 34:16.000
You...

34:19.000 --> 34:21.000
You have the marks of Veran on you.

34:21.000 --> 34:24.000
I forsake the Veran. He deceived me.

34:26.000 --> 34:28.000
You forsake the Veran
because he's a liar.

34:29.000 --> 34:32.000
Well, then we both know his deceits,

34:34.000 --> 34:36.000
when he looks in the eye.

34:37.000 --> 34:39.000
Yes, master.

35:38.000 --> 35:42.000
There. Ready. Come here. Come here.

35:48.000 --> 35:52.000
Now be warned. This is extremely strong.

35:52.000 --> 35:54.000
There's a good chance it will kill.

36:00.000 --> 36:02.000
Oh.

36:07.000 --> 36:10.000
-Now what?
-Now we wait.

36:20.000 --> 36:22.000
There's something I want to say.

36:24.000 --> 36:28.000
I know you think I hate you,

36:28.000 --> 36:30.000
and wish the Gods
had chosen someone else.

36:30.000 --> 36:31.000
Which is...

36:33.000 --> 36:35.000
...basically true.

36:36.000 --> 36:40.000
But anyway,
even though you're annoying,

36:41.000 --> 36:45.000
always, and ask stupid questions,

36:48.000 --> 36:50.000
nevertheless...

36:52.000 --> 36:55.000
Thank you...for believing.

36:58.000 --> 37:02.000
If you didn't, there'd be no hope.

37:08.000 --> 37:10.000
So what I want to say is...

37:54.000 --> 37:56.000
Thank you.

39:40.000 --> 39:43.000
You've got to be fucking kidding me.
