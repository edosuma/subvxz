01:10.336 --> 01:11.667
Elizabeth.

01:13.006 --> 01:16.066
- How long was I out?
- About six minutes.

01:16.142 --> 01:17.336
Thanks.

01:17.911 --> 01:21.142
- OK. I'll be right there.
- OK, I'll be outside. Hey, Fran.

01:22.415 --> 01:24.076
What are you still doin' here?

01:24.150 --> 01:26.948
- How long you been on?
- Twenty-three.

01:27.020 --> 01:29.284
Twenty-three?
Time to go, Elizabeth.

01:29.355 --> 01:31.619
That's not gonna get me
an attending slot.

01:31.691 --> 01:34.819
Adams? She needs to know
how to redress her sutures,

01:34.894 --> 01:36.589
but then she can be discharged.

01:36.663 --> 01:39.962
No, no. Ellis needs an EKG.
I don't like these swollen ankles.

01:40.033 --> 01:41.159
- All right.
- Thanks.

01:41.234 --> 01:43.634
Hey. I took care of Trauma Two
while you slept.

01:43.703 --> 01:46.570
- I wasn't sleeping, I was just...
- You're welcome.

01:46.639 --> 01:48.300
You're on in five and eight.

01:51.911 --> 01:54.106
Jenny? You seen Jenny?

01:54.180 --> 01:57.115
Sorry. Sorry. I'm here.

01:57.183 --> 01:59.481
Hi, Mr. Clarke.
I'm Dr. Masterson.

01:59.552 --> 02:01.713
We're gonna need a CBC,
lytes and a UA.

02:01.788 --> 02:04.882
Anything I can do to make you
feel more comfortable today?

02:04.958 --> 02:07.324
- Marry me?
- Wow.

02:07.393 --> 02:09.725
No, I have my own bus pass.

02:09.795 --> 02:11.457
Well, then how could I refuse?

02:11.531 --> 02:15.467
Let me just call my sister and see if
I can borrow her dress. You sit tight.

02:15.535 --> 02:18.561
Keep an eye on my fiance,
and decrease his morphine drip.

02:22.709 --> 02:24.108
Doin' OK?

02:28.014 --> 02:29.845
Clear bed four.

02:33.419 --> 02:35.080
Sir, you wanna step over...

02:38.091 --> 02:40.651
I got it. I got it.

02:40.727 --> 02:42.058
I got it.

02:44.164 --> 02:46.359
- I was just about to...
- You're welcome.

03:00.213 --> 03:01.805
Thank you.

03:02.749 --> 03:05.843
UTI progressing into infection.
Pneumonia. Diabetic coma.

03:05.919 --> 03:07.978
<i>Una problema con sus rlnones</i>.

03:08.054 --> 03:11.820
I'll have a Venti, triple-shot,
sugar-free, vanilla, nonfat cappuccino.

03:14.093 --> 03:16.186
- Doctor.
- Mr. Clarke?

03:16.262 --> 03:17.627
Will you marry me?

03:17.697 --> 03:21.258
Of course, Mr. Clarke. But first,
we need to find you a robe. Jenny?

03:21.334 --> 03:23.495
Sorry. Sorry. I'm here.

03:24.470 --> 03:26.267
Going full Kabuki tonight, Fran?

03:26.339 --> 03:29.035
The dark circles
were scaring the patients.

03:29.108 --> 03:30.871
And she's got a hot date tonight.

03:30.944 --> 03:34.539
Stop! I'm going out to dinner
with my ex and his mother.

03:34.614 --> 03:36.809
He still hasn't told her
we're divorced.

03:36.883 --> 03:39.681
I won't be responsible for killing
an 80-year-old woman.

03:39.752 --> 03:41.276
I'll trade nights with you.

03:41.354 --> 03:44.118
I've gotta go home and sew
six caterpillar costumes

03:44.190 --> 03:46.420
with Velcro legs
for Katie's dance class.

03:46.492 --> 03:48.551
I don't know
how you guys do it.

03:48.628 --> 03:52.394
Nick is totally pushing me for kids.
I don't have time to shave my legs.

03:52.465 --> 03:55.093
- Stop shaving. He'll leave you alone.
- Really?

03:55.168 --> 03:58.831
Elizabeth, you're so lucky that all
you have to worry about is work.

04:06.846 --> 04:10.043
- Dr. Masterson, are you in there?
- Yeah, I'll be right out.

04:11.751 --> 04:14.117
- Ankle in bed two.
- OK, there's no fracture.

04:14.187 --> 04:17.178
Just wrap it up
and send him home. Thanks.

04:17.257 --> 04:18.986
- Hello?
- Are you really coming?

04:19.058 --> 04:20.184
Yes, I'm coming.

04:20.260 --> 04:22.455
Good. Because this guy is great.

04:22.528 --> 04:24.257
You met him? Is he there?

04:24.330 --> 04:26.628
I haven't actually
met him in person.

04:26.699 --> 04:29.031
Abby, you're not setting me up
with a stranger.

04:29.102 --> 04:31.866
He's a friend of an old friend.
He's really nice.

04:31.938 --> 04:34.805
What does that mean,
fat with a good sense of humor?

04:34.874 --> 04:36.000
Not again, Abby.

04:36.075 --> 04:38.066
It wasn't easy
to get this guy to come.

04:38.144 --> 04:41.773
He doesn't do this kind of thing either.
Do you girls have to do that here?

04:41.848 --> 04:44.612
Do we not have six other rooms
in the house? Help Mommy.

04:44.684 --> 04:47.653
I'm in the seventh circle of hell,
you better show up.

04:47.720 --> 04:49.585
I'll be there.
I'm just really busy.

04:49.656 --> 04:52.625
Don't you dare. You don't know
the meaning of the word.

04:52.692 --> 04:56.287
I'm doin' you this huge favor here.
Beggars can't be choosers.

04:56.362 --> 04:58.990
I am completely capable
of meeting men on my own.

05:00.533 --> 05:03.559
I know. I'd just like you
to meet one who's not bleeding.

05:03.636 --> 05:06.628
I've already had
two marriage proposals today.

05:06.706 --> 05:08.230
- Marry me.
- Yes, Mr. Clarke.

05:08.308 --> 05:10.071
Yes, of course.
Make that three.

05:10.143 --> 05:12.008
- I'll see ya at seven.
- It is seven.

05:12.078 --> 05:14.410
Thirty. 7:30.
What are you making?

05:14.480 --> 05:17.176
Lasagna. Mom's recipe.
No carbohydrate comments.

05:17.250 --> 05:21.778
Please. I'm going on a day and a half
of cafeteria salad. Anything'll do.

05:21.854 --> 05:23.845
Who put SpongeBob in the pasta?

05:23.923 --> 05:25.481
I gotta go.

05:25.558 --> 05:26.991
So, what are you gonna do?

05:27.060 --> 05:29.324
The only other option is Phoenix.

05:29.395 --> 05:32.091
- Would you consider it?
- Phoenix, San Francisco.

05:32.165 --> 05:36.465
Old people and melanomas versus
great sushi and desperate women.

05:36.536 --> 05:37.696
Walsh likes you.

05:37.770 --> 05:40.398
Dr. Walsh. Gunshot victim,
internal hemorrhaging.

05:41.140 --> 05:43.404
- How long have you been here?
- Twelve hours.

05:45.078 --> 05:46.409
A few more.

05:47.347 --> 05:50.009
- All right, Brett.
- I'll scrub up.

05:52.552 --> 05:53.678
Elizabeth.

05:53.753 --> 05:55.345
Yes, sir.

05:55.421 --> 05:57.218
I was going to wait till tomorrow,

05:57.290 --> 06:01.124
but I wanted to let you know
that I've made my decision.

06:01.194 --> 06:03.628
I want you to stay on
as an attending physician.

06:03.696 --> 06:05.561
Really? Thank you.

06:05.631 --> 06:07.394
- Hey. Hey.
- Thank you, Dr. Walsh.

06:07.467 --> 06:08.957
You've earned it.

06:09.035 --> 06:11.799
Unlike some others,
you spend more time being concerned

06:11.871 --> 06:14.465
with what's best for the patient
than kissing my ass.

06:14.540 --> 06:16.906
A risky move, but I like it.

06:16.976 --> 06:19.774
Sir, I can't thank you enough
for this opportunity.

06:19.846 --> 06:23.213
There's so much I want to do here.
I can't wait to get started.

06:23.282 --> 06:25.182
- Elizabeth?
- Yes?

06:25.251 --> 06:28.687
The only thing I need you
to do right now is go home.

06:28.755 --> 06:30.882
- But, sir, I... I have...
- Go.

06:30.957 --> 06:32.686
You've been here 26 hours.

06:33.826 --> 06:35.191
I know all.

06:52.145 --> 06:54.409
- Dr. Masterson.
- Yeah?

06:55.348 --> 06:57.873
I have a bowel obstruction in six.

06:57.950 --> 07:01.283
At least, I think that's what it is.
Can you take a quick peek?

07:02.021 --> 07:04.114
Yeah, of course.

07:09.429 --> 07:11.158
- Brett.
- Congratulations.

07:11.230 --> 07:13.596
Thank you. I didn't know
Walsh was gonna...

07:13.666 --> 07:15.896
I have an offer in Phoenix.
Life's good.

07:15.968 --> 07:18.163
That's great. That's great.

07:18.237 --> 07:19.568
It's fine.

07:25.678 --> 07:27.111
- Hey, Abby, it's me.
- Hey.

07:27.180 --> 07:29.239
I'm sorry I'm late.
I know. I'm on my way.

07:29.315 --> 07:33.149
- Don't worry. Your date's late too.
- Listen. I have good news.

07:33.219 --> 07:36.586
I got the attending position.
I'm staying in San Francisco.

07:36.656 --> 07:38.988
Oh, that's great!
Well, get over here.

07:39.058 --> 07:42.516
- We're breakin' out the champagne.
- I'll be there in a minute. Bye.

07:57.143 --> 07:59.202
This place is heaven.

08:03.216 --> 08:05.343
It's been photographed
for magazines.

08:08.154 --> 08:12.022
Yeah. I think I told you I was
gonna need something furnished.

08:12.091 --> 08:13.683
Well, it is furnished.

08:13.759 --> 08:15.693
Where's the couch?

08:20.299 --> 08:23.427
Do you believe all of this space?

08:23.503 --> 08:27.337
Yeah, it's great
for all those raves I'll be throwing.

08:31.444 --> 08:34.106
I'm... sensing a "no."

08:35.847 --> 08:37.179
Wow, huh?

08:38.116 --> 08:40.381
I know. This place
isn't usually available,

08:40.453 --> 08:44.253
but the couple's spending all their time
in Palm Springs now.

09:21.794 --> 09:25.025
David, I'm just not quite sure
what you're looking for.

09:25.097 --> 09:27.588
Maybe if we could
communicate a little more.

09:27.667 --> 09:29.635
Maybe if you could
let me know a bit more

09:29.702 --> 09:33.536
about what's going on with you,
with yourjob, your family situation.

09:33.606 --> 09:36.006
- I don't wanna talk about that.
- Here's an idea:

09:36.075 --> 09:39.841
Stop looking for a couple
of months. Start again.

09:39.912 --> 09:42.005
You've gotta know
where you wanna live.

09:42.081 --> 09:44.572
I just... I'm... I'm not...

09:44.650 --> 09:46.277
...getting what it is you...

09:48.220 --> 09:50.450
Hey, well... no. David.

09:50.523 --> 09:52.252
David, are you kidding?

09:52.325 --> 09:54.190
Wait, David. Look, come on.

09:54.260 --> 09:56.455
A place like this,
it is long gone by now.

09:56.529 --> 10:00.124
No, listen, there's 90 vultures
and just one carcass.

10:00.199 --> 10:03.430
All right, fine. I'll call them.

10:04.670 --> 10:07.605
He did? OK.

10:07.673 --> 10:10.005
Well, right.
As soon as I know.

10:10.076 --> 10:12.271
Thank you so much for your help.

10:13.613 --> 10:16.480
Well, it's pretty obvious
why this hasn't rented.

10:16.549 --> 10:19.541
There's no one-year lease.
It's a month-to-month sublet.

10:19.619 --> 10:22.247
- Why?
- Some family matter.

10:22.321 --> 10:24.619
They were pretty
close-mouthed about it.

10:28.561 --> 10:30.222
Wow, what a view.

10:41.774 --> 10:43.105
David.

10:46.512 --> 10:47.843
Wow.

10:49.715 --> 10:53.378
This is... sensational.

10:54.553 --> 10:58.250
Oh, my God.
And it's got the private access?

10:58.324 --> 10:59.848
They didn't do much with it,

10:59.925 --> 11:04.191
but, I mean, you really
could do something with this.

11:04.263 --> 11:06.390
Isn't this gorgeous?

11:16.609 --> 11:20.602
Well, there's a few places
in the Richmond we haven't hit yet.

11:20.680 --> 11:22.079
I like the couch.

11:22.148 --> 11:23.479
The couch.

11:23.549 --> 11:25.176
Good couch.

11:27.887 --> 11:29.218
Good couch.

11:49.775 --> 11:52.107
David. David, come here.

12:07.393 --> 12:10.556
- What? What?
- There's nothing worth stealing here.

12:10.629 --> 12:13.792
- There's no money, no drugs.
- I'm not stealing anything.

12:13.866 --> 12:16.460
OK. I'm sure there's
a homeless shelter nearby.

12:16.535 --> 12:19.095
I will give you money
for cab fare and a good meal.

12:19.171 --> 12:21.401
But please, don't blow it
on more beer, OK?

12:21.474 --> 12:24.068
I am not homeless. I live here.

12:24.143 --> 12:27.738
OK. You can't live here,
because I live here.

12:27.813 --> 12:29.144
This is my apartment.

12:29.215 --> 12:31.775
- Since when?
- Since I rented it.

12:31.851 --> 12:33.216
- You rented it.
- Yeah.

12:33.285 --> 12:35.617
- You know what? I don't need this.
- What?

12:35.688 --> 12:38.248
- Rent scam, right?
- What are you talking about?

12:38.324 --> 12:42.124
There's probably five other people
who paid deposits and got the keys.

12:42.194 --> 12:44.458
- And moved in all their things?
- Yeah... What?

12:44.530 --> 12:46.964
This is my stuff. All of this.

12:47.032 --> 12:49.296
That's my couch,
that's my coffee table.

12:49.368 --> 12:51.165
Is that a ring?

12:51.237 --> 12:52.966
Have you ever heard
of a coaster?

12:53.038 --> 12:54.835
Or a trash can, for that matter?

12:54.907 --> 12:59.105
I don't care who you are, you're gonna
mop that up. I'm getting the bucket.

12:59.178 --> 13:01.305
It's like a pig
moved into my house.

13:01.514 --> 13:03.778
- What?
- Like a filthy pig.

13:03.849 --> 13:05.612
You... You moved in when?

13:18.130 --> 13:19.461
Hello?

13:46.292 --> 13:48.089
- I told you to get out.
- Jesus!

13:56.669 --> 13:59.695
OK. So, what's this all about?

13:59.772 --> 14:00.830
What? Nothin'.

14:00.906 --> 14:02.100
Nothin'.

14:02.174 --> 14:03.766
So, you called me for nothin'?

14:03.843 --> 14:06.311
I've been sort of
seeing someone.

14:06.378 --> 14:09.643
Seeing someone?
That's what I'm talkin' about. Finally.

14:09.715 --> 14:12.707
- You think it's a good thing?
- Absolutely.

14:12.785 --> 14:15.811
Yeah. The last time I tried
to hook you up, you bailed out.

14:15.888 --> 14:18.982
This is good, and the fact
that you initiated it yourself,

14:19.058 --> 14:21.925
that's important. OK?
Now, who is she? Do I know her?

14:21.994 --> 14:24.394
I mean I'm seeing someone
that's not there.

14:24.463 --> 14:26.454
She's emotionally unavailable?

14:30.002 --> 14:32.630
You mean like a hallucination.

14:33.372 --> 14:35.533
Twice, in my apartment.

14:35.608 --> 14:37.041
A woman.

14:37.109 --> 14:38.201
Attractive?

14:39.211 --> 14:42.078
- Not really there, Jack.
- Right. Right. OK.

14:42.147 --> 14:45.446
So when you saw this woman,
were you drunk?

14:46.886 --> 14:48.877
I mean, I had a little buzz.

14:48.954 --> 14:51.047
Dave, don't lie to me,
it doesn't help.

14:51.123 --> 14:52.852
OK, fine, I was wasted.

14:52.925 --> 14:56.258
But still, I shouldn't be seeing
some little blonde control freak

14:56.328 --> 14:57.955
running around my apartment.

14:58.030 --> 15:01.227
Why are you writing this down?
This isn't a session.

15:01.300 --> 15:06.237
That's insulting, OK? I'm your friend
Jack here, I'm not charging you.

15:06.305 --> 15:08.500
But if this thing rolls
into a second hour

15:08.574 --> 15:11.634
we're gonna have to work out
some kind of deal. I'm kidding.

15:11.710 --> 15:13.837
So, hold on a second.
You were drunk,

15:13.913 --> 15:17.076
- you saw this blonde, controlling...
- I gotta stop drinkin'.

15:17.149 --> 15:18.844
- No.
- No?

15:18.918 --> 15:21.887
Yeah, drink, party.
Just do it with other people.

15:21.954 --> 15:24.514
God gave us alcohol
as a social lubricant.

15:24.590 --> 15:26.990
Make men brave,
make women loose.

15:27.059 --> 15:30.290
What is that,
some Berkeley shrink thing?

15:30.362 --> 15:31.989
No. Look around you, OK?

15:32.064 --> 15:35.033
See this? This is the world.

15:35.100 --> 15:36.328
Join it.

15:36.402 --> 15:38.427
Stop swimming around
in your own mind.

15:38.504 --> 15:41.769
That is a dangerous neighborhood
you should not go into alone.

15:41.840 --> 15:45.105
Come on, Dave.
It's been two years, man.

15:45.177 --> 15:46.838
No more hiding out.

15:48.213 --> 15:50.511
Absolutely not.

16:39.465 --> 16:42.628
- Are you insane? What are you doing?
- Oh, God, what is this?

16:42.701 --> 16:44.931
I didn't want to,
but I will call the police.

16:45.004 --> 16:47.336
I'm sleeping. It's a dream.

16:47.406 --> 16:50.341
It's one of those dreams
and you know you're dreaming.

16:50.409 --> 16:53.469
- How do you keep getting in here?
- It's you who's in here.

16:53.545 --> 16:55.012
Oh, my.

16:55.080 --> 16:57.105
This is more serious than I thought.

16:57.182 --> 16:58.615
Go away, you don't exist.

16:58.684 --> 17:00.811
I'm gonna ask you
a series of questions.

17:00.886 --> 17:02.649
I want you to answer honestly.

17:02.721 --> 17:05.451
Has your recent
alcohol consumption increased?

17:05.523 --> 17:07.151
Yeah, so?

17:07.226 --> 17:11.127
Are you hearing voices or seeing
things that aren't quite real to you?

17:11.195 --> 17:13.130
As a matter of fact, yeah.

17:13.198 --> 17:16.964
Have you recently sought consult
from a mental health care professional?

17:17.036 --> 17:19.128
What? How do you know?
Stay away from me.

17:19.204 --> 17:21.729
Do you feel paranoid,
like people are out to get you?

17:21.807 --> 17:23.637
Why are you asking
so many questions?

17:23.709 --> 17:27.041
I'll take that as a yes.
Listen to me.

17:27.112 --> 17:29.979
You have fantasized,
quite convincingly,

17:30.049 --> 17:34.383
that you've rented an apartment that,
in fact, belongs to somebody else.

17:34.453 --> 17:36.648
Pick up that pillow.

17:36.722 --> 17:38.849
Pick it up. It's OK.

17:38.924 --> 17:40.892
There's a small red stain
on the back

17:40.959 --> 17:43.325
where I once spilled
cherry cough syrup.

17:43.395 --> 17:46.455
Yes, that's it.
How else would I know that?

17:46.532 --> 17:50.400
Or the fact that these sheets that
you're now soiling are from Nordstrom.

17:50.469 --> 17:52.869
I still have the receipt,
it's in that drawer.

17:52.938 --> 17:54.667
Open it up and check.

17:55.741 --> 17:58.141
I think you need to
come to terms with the fact

17:58.210 --> 17:59.871
that you may be mentally ill.

18:01.480 --> 18:03.141
- Really?
- Yes.

18:04.149 --> 18:06.674
This is my apartment.
These are my sheets.

18:06.752 --> 18:09.414
That's my nightstand.
That's my picture...

18:11.757 --> 18:14.191
- Where's my picture?
- What picture?

18:14.259 --> 18:17.092
There was a picture there of my...

18:17.162 --> 18:20.427
There was a picture
right there on the nightstand.

18:20.499 --> 18:23.434
- That was empty when I moved in.
- It was just there.

18:23.502 --> 18:26.630
You know what? I've had enough.
I am calling the police.

18:26.705 --> 18:28.764
- No, no, no, no.
- It's too late.

18:32.311 --> 18:33.778
What'd you do to my phone?

18:36.181 --> 18:37.648
Why can't I...?

18:40.919 --> 18:42.181
You stay right there.

18:42.254 --> 18:44.245
I'm gonna use the one in the kitchen.

18:51.630 --> 18:53.495
Hey, Grace,
David Abbott here.

18:53.565 --> 18:55.795
The people who sublet
this apartment to me,

18:55.868 --> 18:58.336
- do you have their number?
- Is something wrong?

18:58.403 --> 19:02.635
No, no. I was just wondering
about the previous tenant, that's all.

19:02.708 --> 19:06.644
Well, the woman that I dealt with,
she didn't want to talk about it.

19:06.712 --> 19:08.942
It was some kind of
tragedy in the family.

19:09.014 --> 19:12.177
I didn't press for details
'cause I don't need any more drama.

19:12.251 --> 19:15.687
- You think this girl died?
- Well, you better hope so.

19:15.754 --> 19:18.052
That's the only way
they're gonna get off

19:18.123 --> 19:20.956
this month-to-month thing
and give you a real lease.

19:21.026 --> 19:24.325
- That's not exactly the reason I was...
- Come on, David, grow up.

19:24.396 --> 19:26.364
Look, it has a view, a fireplace.

19:26.431 --> 19:30.094
People would kill their grandmothers
for a lot less in this city.

20:01.466 --> 20:03.525
- Can I help you with anything?
- No.

20:03.602 --> 20:07.333
I mean, do you believe in this stuff?

20:07.406 --> 20:10.341
Well, you don't until you do.

20:10.409 --> 20:12.274
That's a little dated.

20:12.344 --> 20:15.939
I recommend the Rosemary Preston.
It's totally seminal.

20:16.014 --> 20:18.881
'Scuse me.
Where's your UFO section?

20:18.951 --> 20:20.816
It's back and to the left.

20:20.886 --> 20:24.219
Ufology. It's not even
a real science.

20:24.289 --> 20:26.587
So, what kind of encounter
have you had?

20:26.658 --> 20:29.024
- Encounter?
- Ectoplasm?

20:29.094 --> 20:31.085
Soniferous ether?

20:31.163 --> 20:34.690
I have a killer seance book
if you're into communication.

20:34.766 --> 20:36.961
Communicating is not her problem.

20:38.036 --> 20:41.369
Righteous.
I have exactly what you need.

20:47.312 --> 20:48.506
Yeah.

20:51.850 --> 20:53.181
Crap!

20:55.787 --> 20:56.776
There.

20:58.457 --> 21:00.789
"Spirit, awake.

21:01.526 --> 21:03.994
Spirit, partake.

21:04.062 --> 21:07.031
Spirit, without fear.

21:07.099 --> 21:09.761
Spirit, appear."

21:14.273 --> 21:16.002
Are... are you here?

21:18.543 --> 21:20.170
Come on, I think you're here.

21:24.816 --> 21:26.340
OK.

21:26.418 --> 21:29.353
I've got a hot, moist
cup of coffee in my hand.

21:29.421 --> 21:32.015
There is no coaster on this table.

21:32.090 --> 21:35.719
I'm going to set it down
on this lovely mahogany...

21:35.794 --> 21:37.352
Don't you dare!

21:38.230 --> 21:39.993
We... We need to talk.

21:40.065 --> 21:41.123
About what?

21:43.702 --> 21:47.729
Has it crossed your mind that there
might be something a little off

21:47.806 --> 21:50.639
about the way you've
been spending your days?

21:50.709 --> 21:54.236
Actually, yes. It's weird having
a squatter in your living room.

21:54.313 --> 21:55.837
I am not...

21:57.482 --> 21:58.744
OK, let's start over.

21:58.817 --> 22:00.717
Hi, I'm David Abbott.

22:00.786 --> 22:02.686
And you are...?

22:02.754 --> 22:04.847
I am...

22:07.059 --> 22:09.653
I'm Elizabeth.
My name is Elizabeth.

22:09.728 --> 22:12.754
You didn't know that.
You... you had to read that.

22:12.831 --> 22:15.322
I think I know my own name.

22:15.400 --> 22:18.733
OK. When was the last time
that you remember

22:18.804 --> 22:21.637
actually talking to someone
other than me?

22:21.707 --> 22:24.141
The other day. The other day.

22:24.209 --> 22:26.871
And... And when you're not here,

22:26.945 --> 22:30.210
what do you do
with the rest of your day?

22:30.282 --> 22:33.183
Certainly a lot more
than you do, that's for sure.

22:33.251 --> 22:35.378
Let's not stray from the point, Lizzie.

22:35.454 --> 22:37.854
Don't call me Lizzie.
I'm not in kindergarten.

22:37.923 --> 22:40.585
- My name's Elizabeth.
- You think. Let me ask you,

22:40.659 --> 22:43.492
has anything dramatic
happened to you recently?

22:43.562 --> 22:44.756
Like what?

22:44.830 --> 22:47.355
I don't know, like dying maybe?

22:47.432 --> 22:48.831
How dare you say that to me?

22:48.900 --> 22:50.094
OK, calm down.

22:50.168 --> 22:52.636
Get your hands off of me, you pervert!

22:52.704 --> 22:55.298
Calm down. I'm not...
I'm not here to hurt you.

22:55.374 --> 22:57.706
I'm trying to help you
face the fact that...

22:57.776 --> 22:59.505
- I'm not dead.
- Look around you.

22:59.578 --> 23:01.170
There should be a bright light.

23:01.246 --> 23:03.874
- There's no light.
- Walk into the light, Elizabeth!

23:03.949 --> 23:08.147
There is no light! I am not dead!
I think I would know if I was dead!

23:13.258 --> 23:14.816
What's happening to me?

23:14.893 --> 23:16.155
You're dead!

23:16.228 --> 23:18.321
Stop saying that!

23:18.397 --> 23:19.728
Missed.

23:21.466 --> 23:24.560
OK. OK, that's enough.
That's enough.

23:24.636 --> 23:27.230
You're just giving me a headache!
Get off of me!

23:27.305 --> 23:28.670
OK. All right, all right.

23:28.740 --> 23:31.004
It's not my fault
you're the way you are.

23:31.076 --> 23:33.544
- I just want you out of my house.
- You get out!

23:37.149 --> 23:39.208
Rest in peace.

23:39.284 --> 23:40.478
I'm not leaving.

23:57.169 --> 23:58.761
Another one, my, my.

24:00.372 --> 24:02.397
Golden State playing very well...

24:02.474 --> 24:05.341
I love ya
Tomorrow

24:05.410 --> 24:09.437
You're only a day away

24:09.514 --> 24:12.608
Tomorrow, tomorrow

24:12.684 --> 24:15.585
I love ya
Tomorrow

24:15.654 --> 24:20.091
You're only a day away

24:20.158 --> 24:21.489
Fine!

24:23.128 --> 24:26.791
The sun'll come out
Tomorrow

24:26.865 --> 24:29.800
Bet your bottom dollar that tomorrow

24:29.868 --> 24:32.234
You know what? That's it.
I've had it with you.

24:32.304 --> 24:35.068
I've tried to be nice,
but now you're outta here!

24:35.140 --> 24:37.472
The power of Christ compels you!

24:37.542 --> 24:40.340
The power of Christ compels you!

24:40.412 --> 24:43.074
The power of Christ compels you!

24:43.148 --> 24:46.413
The power of Christ compels you!

24:46.485 --> 24:48.248
He can't even see me.

24:48.320 --> 24:49.582
A little more left.

24:49.654 --> 24:52.350
- You're mopping that up.
- More, more.

25:00.632 --> 25:02.964
They're gonna set off
the smoke detector.

25:10.041 --> 25:12.032
Dad, we got it!

25:18.984 --> 25:22.784
All set, sir. We have the spirit.

25:22.854 --> 25:24.082
A butter dish.

25:24.656 --> 25:26.954
- You sure?
- Oh, definitely.

25:27.025 --> 25:28.822
I have him right here.

25:28.894 --> 25:30.521
I'm gonna go give him a flush.

25:36.201 --> 25:37.327
That's it?

25:37.402 --> 25:38.869
You just sit there?

25:38.937 --> 25:42.634
Hey, you want bells and whistles
or a reading?

25:42.707 --> 25:44.732
Come on.
He can't see me, either.

25:44.809 --> 25:48.870
- For some hideous reason, only you can.
- OK, there's somethin'.

25:48.947 --> 25:50.915
Definitely a presence.

25:50.982 --> 25:53.416
How original. Tell me more.

25:53.485 --> 25:55.419
It's hostile.

25:55.487 --> 25:57.045
Wants you outta here.

25:57.122 --> 25:58.817
Actually, he's not bad.

25:58.890 --> 26:00.380
You should move, dude.

26:01.626 --> 26:03.093
- I should move?
- I would.

26:03.161 --> 26:04.526
I like him.

26:04.596 --> 26:06.188
No, I'm not gonna move.

26:06.264 --> 26:07.629
Can't you feel that, man?

26:07.699 --> 26:10.532
There's like this
cancer-causing ray of spirit hate

26:10.602 --> 26:13.662
- searing right towards your body.
- This kid's got a gift.

26:13.738 --> 26:15.763
- I'm not moving!
- Why not?

26:15.840 --> 26:18.240
It's not like it's that great
an apartment.

26:18.310 --> 26:19.572
- What?
- Yes, it is.

26:19.644 --> 26:21.578
- It's got a view.
- And a fireplace.

26:21.646 --> 26:22.738
Whatever, dude.

26:22.814 --> 26:25.282
Yo, do you have,
like, a diet anything?

26:25.350 --> 26:27.944
I'm, like, 99.9 percent
parched here.

26:28.019 --> 26:29.748
Could really use a cola.

26:31.389 --> 26:32.583
Yeah. Come on.

26:42.000 --> 26:44.867
Move out?
That... that can't be it.

26:44.936 --> 26:47.769
Could you talk to her
and tell her she should pass on?

26:47.839 --> 26:49.739
"Could you please talk to her?"

26:49.808 --> 26:51.867
- I'm ignoring you.
- I'm ignoring you.

26:51.943 --> 26:55.401
She won't accept that she's dead.
I told her to walk to the light.

26:55.480 --> 26:56.538
She wouldn't do it.

26:56.615 --> 26:59.880
That's because there is no light.
God, you're infuriating!

26:59.951 --> 27:01.543
Wait, what's goin' on?

27:03.688 --> 27:05.883
You know what?
Do you think I like this?

27:05.957 --> 27:07.652
Do you think this is easy for me?

27:07.726 --> 27:10.661
I know something's different,
something is not right.

27:10.729 --> 27:12.754
- I'm walking through walls.
- You know,

27:12.831 --> 27:14.355
I don't think I can help you.

27:14.432 --> 27:17.663
This is one of the most
alive spirits I've ever been around.

27:17.736 --> 27:20.068
- She's not goin' anywhere.
- What do you mean?

27:20.138 --> 27:23.505
I agree with her, dude.
She's not dead.

27:26.211 --> 27:28.873
But you, whoa.

27:28.947 --> 27:31.609
You gotta deal with this...

27:35.654 --> 27:39.181
'Cause seriously, that's like
the darkest aura I've ever seen.

27:39.257 --> 27:42.818
Suckin' the life right outta you.
It's killin' you, man.

27:43.561 --> 27:45.426
You have to let her go, dude.

27:45.497 --> 27:48.489
How can I, when she won't leave?

27:48.566 --> 27:50.329
Not your spirit girl.

27:50.402 --> 27:52.370
I'm talkin' 'bout the other one.

27:52.437 --> 27:54.496
The one you're keepin' in here.

27:54.572 --> 27:57.006
That's what's really
haunting you, isn't it?

27:57.876 --> 28:00.743
- I don't want to talk about that.
- I get it.

28:00.812 --> 28:02.336
You were dumped.

28:02.414 --> 28:05.781
Probably for some guy who doesn't
have a couch fused to his ass.

28:05.850 --> 28:06.839
Shut up.

28:06.918 --> 28:08.886
You can dish it out
but you can't take it?

28:08.953 --> 28:12.889
You bring Father Flanagan
and the Joy Luck Club to get rid of me.

28:12.957 --> 28:15.084
But I talk about you
getting dumped once...

28:15.160 --> 28:18.755
You don't know what the hell
you're talking about. Shut the hell up!

28:18.830 --> 28:20.889
Sorry for your loss, bro.

28:24.235 --> 28:26.169
A word to the wise, girl.

28:26.237 --> 28:28.432
Show some respect for the dead.

28:37.982 --> 28:39.108
David?

28:42.187 --> 28:43.848
I'm sorry.

28:46.858 --> 28:49.452
It occurred to me now that I...

28:49.527 --> 28:51.859
...probably don't know you
all that well.

28:55.467 --> 28:57.332
I got this place for the roof.

28:59.537 --> 29:01.562
I was gonna do
a whole garden out here...

29:02.140 --> 29:04.938
...eventually, I think.

29:05.009 --> 29:06.806
Now I'm babbling.

29:06.878 --> 29:08.345
I...

29:09.547 --> 29:10.878
I'm really sorry.

29:12.684 --> 29:16.677
Most people who deal with loss really
find it helpful to talk about things.

29:16.755 --> 29:18.950
I don't want to talk about it!

29:19.023 --> 29:21.014
Anger works too.

29:24.295 --> 29:25.694
Who was he talking about?

29:25.764 --> 29:28.028
Laura. Her name was Laura.

29:28.099 --> 29:30.033
Who's Laura?

29:30.101 --> 29:31.932
She was my wife.

29:39.210 --> 29:40.768
What do you think I am, stupid?

29:40.845 --> 29:43.507
What is this? Oh, come on.

29:48.553 --> 29:51.113
Don't. This is not gonna help.

29:51.189 --> 29:53.987
How would you know? Have
you ever been in a bar in your life?

30:00.999 --> 30:02.990
The groundhog emerges!

30:03.067 --> 30:06.002
I didn't think you'd make it.
All right! All right!

30:06.070 --> 30:08.937
It's Jeff, Jody, Kim, Valerie.

30:09.007 --> 30:10.338
This is my buddy, Dave.

30:10.408 --> 30:12.467
- Nice to meet you.
- What are you drinkin'?

30:12.544 --> 30:14.068
- Coffee.
- Scotch!

30:14.145 --> 30:16.010
- Don't you dare!
- Make it a double!

30:16.080 --> 30:19.277
You don't have to wait.
I can start the hangover right now.

30:20.685 --> 30:23.085
Yeah. Yeah.

30:23.154 --> 30:25.247
He's excited to be out. I know!

30:25.323 --> 30:26.449
Friday night!

30:26.524 --> 30:29.084
- You can't drink these feelings away.
- Watch me.

30:31.462 --> 30:32.793
So, you OK?

30:32.864 --> 30:36.163
Say goodbye, walk to the door,
let's get some food in your stomach.

30:36.234 --> 30:37.963
Who made you my mother?

30:39.170 --> 30:40.501
Did I...?

30:40.572 --> 30:43.097
How you comin' along
with those hallucinations?

30:43.174 --> 30:45.665
- That was nothing.
- You're not a well man, David.

30:45.743 --> 30:49.042
- It's just a lack of sleep.
- Sleep? You gettin' any?

30:49.113 --> 30:50.808
- Eight hours.
- Twelve.

30:50.882 --> 30:54.113
- Nine, tops.
- Opium addicts are more alert than you.

30:54.185 --> 30:56.710
- Will you knock it off.
- Don't you dare!

30:56.788 --> 30:58.346
Don't!

30:58.423 --> 30:59.447
Last chance.

30:59.524 --> 31:01.617
What are you gonna do about it?

31:12.937 --> 31:14.029
Dave, buddy!

31:20.645 --> 31:21.976
I'm so...

31:23.414 --> 31:25.143
I'm sorry. God!

31:25.216 --> 31:27.684
- You freak!
- Dave, that is uncool, man!

31:34.092 --> 31:35.218
Good God!

31:35.293 --> 31:37.488
You're gonna thank me
for that one day.

31:37.562 --> 31:41.293
For what? Making me look like a lunatic
in front of all those people?

31:54.579 --> 31:56.444
Why are you still here?

31:57.382 --> 32:01.011
That's a scary question.
I have no idea.

32:01.085 --> 32:02.848
Why are you the only one
that can see me?

32:02.921 --> 32:04.252
Don't ask me.

32:05.390 --> 32:09.656
All I know is when I'm not with you,
it's like I don't... exist.

32:11.496 --> 32:13.259
Oh, my God.

32:13.331 --> 32:14.992
Maybe I am dead.

32:18.202 --> 32:19.863
Oh, come on now.

32:21.873 --> 32:24.068
I'm... I'm sorry
that I said you're dead.

32:24.142 --> 32:25.609
Maybe you're not dead.

32:25.677 --> 32:28.475
Maybe you're just very... light.

32:30.281 --> 32:33.876
If I could just remember something
about who I am, or was.

32:33.952 --> 32:36.182
I mean, then I'd know
once and for all.

32:39.324 --> 32:41.224
I'm trying to figure it out. I...

32:41.292 --> 32:43.157
I just can't do it by myself.

32:46.631 --> 32:49.657
You're not asking me to...
to help you, are you?

32:49.734 --> 32:51.133
Look.

32:51.202 --> 32:53.261
You have two realities
to choose from.

32:53.338 --> 32:56.034
First one being that a woman
has come into your life

32:56.107 --> 32:59.668
in a very unconventional way
and she happens to need your assistance.

32:59.744 --> 33:01.177
Right.

33:01.245 --> 33:03.839
The second one is that
you're an insane person,

33:03.915 --> 33:06.213
sitting on a park bench
talking to yourself.

33:08.319 --> 33:10.344
I think I prefer the first one.

33:10.421 --> 33:12.150
OK.

33:12.223 --> 33:13.656
Let's find out who I am.

33:19.430 --> 33:22.661
No. I think that apartment was vacant.

33:23.101 --> 33:24.432
That was a woman?

33:26.004 --> 33:27.528
Nobody live there.

33:27.605 --> 33:30.039
It's like I was a ghost
before I was dead.

33:32.377 --> 33:34.504
Hi. Can I help you?

33:34.579 --> 33:37.275
Finally, somebody normal.
I bet we were friends.

33:37.348 --> 33:39.839
Hi, I'm... I'm David.
I am a new tenant here.

33:39.917 --> 33:42.317
Hi, David, Katrina.
Come on in.

33:42.387 --> 33:45.447
- She's friendly, I like her.
- This'll just take a sec.

33:45.523 --> 33:49.391
I have a question. The apartment
upstairs, it belonged to a young woman.

33:49.460 --> 33:51.758
Yeah, I think there
was somebody up there.

33:51.829 --> 33:53.990
But she was, like, totally antisocial.

33:54.065 --> 33:56.329
OK, maybe we weren't close friends.

33:56.401 --> 33:59.564
Kinda like a cat lady,
but without any cats.

33:59.637 --> 34:01.036
Right?

34:01.105 --> 34:03.300
OK, I think we're done here. Let's go.

34:03.374 --> 34:05.774
- OK, thank you.
- Look. This is so retro,

34:05.843 --> 34:08.175
but I've got a window
I can't get open.

34:08.246 --> 34:10.043
- She's got to be kidding.
- What?

34:10.114 --> 34:11.138
- What?
- What?

34:11.215 --> 34:13.045
She wants you to come in.

34:13.117 --> 34:14.641
Well, if it's painted shut

34:14.719 --> 34:17.516
and you use a screwdriver
to jam it, it sometimes...

34:17.588 --> 34:19.054
Oh, tried it.

34:19.123 --> 34:20.715
Won't budge.

34:20.792 --> 34:23.761
No preliminaries. Incredible.

34:23.828 --> 34:26.695
I'd like to help,
but I have dinner plans.

34:26.764 --> 34:28.822
Well, I got dessert.

34:28.900 --> 34:30.527
I just threw up in my mouth.

34:30.601 --> 34:33.126
Well, OK. I...

34:34.871 --> 34:35.860
Nice to meet you.

34:35.940 --> 34:37.407
- You too, Dave.
- Thanks.

34:39.077 --> 34:41.170
Why is she wearing workout clothes?

34:41.245 --> 34:43.940
If you were gonna work out
in the middle of the day,

34:44.014 --> 34:47.917
the only reason to wear workout clothes,
do you really need a push-up bra?

34:47.985 --> 34:49.782
The whole point's
to strap 'em down.

34:49.853 --> 34:53.516
- You're not comin' with me anymore.
- Why? Something mightjog my memory.

34:53.591 --> 34:57.925
Too bad. You're like an AM radio someone
shoved in my head and I can't turn off.

34:57.995 --> 35:01.726
You don't think she was
completely un-classy and predatory?

35:01.799 --> 35:04.290
Those happen to be
two of men's favorite things.

35:04.368 --> 35:07.428
- Why don't you just date a pit bull?
- Maybe I will.

35:07.505 --> 35:09.439
- Damn it!
- What?

35:10.575 --> 35:12.566
I locked my key in the apartment.

35:12.643 --> 35:15.373
There's a spare key
under the fire extinguisher.

35:15.446 --> 35:19.576
I mean, I guess she's sexy if you're
into that whole tall, big boobs,

35:19.650 --> 35:21.880
long legs, model-y sorta thing.

35:21.953 --> 35:24.148
I guess if you wanna be that guy.

35:24.222 --> 35:25.951
There are five other units here,

35:26.023 --> 35:28.992
and not one person even
remembers what you look like.

35:29.060 --> 35:30.891
Talk about being disconnected.

35:30.962 --> 35:34.557
- Are you sure you really want that?
- Yes, I'm sure.

35:35.867 --> 35:37.596
Next drawer on the left.

35:40.338 --> 35:42.932
There's a funnel in there too,
if you need it.

35:45.743 --> 35:47.870
- Check it out.
- What is it?

35:47.945 --> 35:49.071
New leads.

35:49.147 --> 35:51.411
Look, there's an address
written on here.

35:51.482 --> 35:54.076
I can't make that out.
Is that a five or a six?

35:54.152 --> 35:55.676
I think it's a...

35:55.753 --> 35:58.187
No, no, no, that's a five.
Definitely a five.

35:58.256 --> 36:01.851
So we have an address, a dry cleaning
ticket and a book of matches.

36:01.926 --> 36:03.325
You know what that means?

36:03.394 --> 36:06.693
- We could start a very small fire?
- There's still hope.

36:06.764 --> 36:09.858
Oh, yes, these pants were jet black.

36:09.934 --> 36:11.094
Armani, I believe.

36:11.169 --> 36:13.228
I remember them.
They were expensive.

36:13.304 --> 36:16.467
Do you remember anything else
about the woman? It's important.

36:16.541 --> 36:18.975
She's pleasant,
but a little dull maybe.

36:19.043 --> 36:20.237
- Dull?
- Dull?

36:20.311 --> 36:24.213
I think of her,
I think of sadness, loneliness.

36:24.282 --> 36:27.046
I don't need a psychological
profile from this guy.

36:27.118 --> 36:29.609
- Can we just get the pants?
- Can I get the pants?

36:29.687 --> 36:32.281
Ltem left too long.
We give them to homeless shelter.

36:32.356 --> 36:34.847
Are you insane? They were Armani.

36:34.926 --> 36:37.292
OK, let's go.

36:38.663 --> 36:39.925
Are you coming or not?

36:39.997 --> 36:42.124
They're pants,
what do you need 'em for?

36:52.243 --> 36:55.337
425, I think.

36:56.614 --> 36:59.344
- Look familiar?
- Not really.

37:05.690 --> 37:07.021
Hi.

37:08.292 --> 37:09.953
Hello.

37:11.295 --> 37:12.694
- Can I help you?
- Hi.

37:12.763 --> 37:16.563
This might sound a little odd, but I was
wondering if you knew a certain woman.

37:16.634 --> 37:19.432
Blond, about five-foot-one...

37:19.503 --> 37:21.403
- Two. And a half.
- Two and a half?

37:21.472 --> 37:23.872
Oh, my God. Who are you?

37:23.941 --> 37:25.169
I don't know you. I...

37:25.243 --> 37:28.041
- Did my wife hire you?
- I'm sorry, what?

37:28.112 --> 37:29.773
I knew she'd find out.

37:29.847 --> 37:32.179
Whatever she's payin' you,
I'll double it.

37:32.250 --> 37:34.844
- Anything you want.
- I'm not looking for money.

37:34.919 --> 37:37.547
- Donald! Who is it?
- That's her. Come back around six.

37:37.622 --> 37:38.816
I'll have a check ready.

37:44.662 --> 37:46.152
Wow.

37:49.867 --> 37:53.030
What? You don't think I actually
had sex with that old horndog.

37:53.104 --> 37:56.870
- Kinda looks that way, Lizzie.
- It's Elizabeth. And that's disgusting.

37:56.941 --> 38:00.809
Well, look on the bright side.
At 6:00, I'm coming into some money.

38:04.615 --> 38:06.276
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

38:11.088 --> 38:12.749
Oh, my God.

38:12.823 --> 38:15.485
Maybe I was a slut.

38:15.559 --> 38:18.494
A lonely, home-wrecking slut.

38:28.372 --> 38:32.604
So what if I was a slut? There's nothing
wrong with a healthy sexual appetite.

38:32.677 --> 38:33.666
Not at all.

38:33.744 --> 38:36.907
Look who I'm talking to,
Mr. Tried To Feel Me Up One Time.

38:36.981 --> 38:38.972
I'm trying to agree with you.

38:39.050 --> 38:40.642
- David.
- What?

38:40.718 --> 38:42.049
This is it.

38:42.119 --> 38:44.110
You recognize it? Good.

38:44.188 --> 38:45.712
OK. Come on.

38:51.662 --> 38:54.187
This is Moose's.
I love this restaurant.

38:54.265 --> 38:56.130
- You ate here a lot.
- No.

38:56.200 --> 38:57.599
- No.
- I never did.

38:57.668 --> 39:01.001
I remember looking in that window
and wishing I could eat in here.

39:01.072 --> 39:04.633
What, were you a homeless
street urchin? Why didn't you?

39:04.709 --> 39:07.200
I wanted to,
I just never got around to it.

39:08.479 --> 39:11.778
Maybe the dry-cleaner guy
was right about me.

39:11.849 --> 39:13.510
Hello, can I help you?

39:13.584 --> 39:15.950
No, thank you.
Maybe some other time.

39:16.821 --> 39:17.810
Kenny!

39:18.756 --> 39:21.054
Lvan, call 911,
we need an ambulance!

39:21.125 --> 39:22.752
- Are you OK?
- Undo his collar.

39:22.827 --> 39:24.624
- Is he breathing?
- I can't tell.

39:24.695 --> 39:28.028
- Maybe we should do mouth-to-mouth.
- God. We need a doctor.

39:28.099 --> 39:29.760
We really have to find a doctor.

39:29.834 --> 39:32.632
Is there a doctor here? Anyone?

39:32.703 --> 39:34.364
- Feel his chest.
- What?

39:34.438 --> 39:36.770
His chest,
check and see if it's bloated.

39:36.841 --> 39:38.638
- How would I know?
- Just do it!

39:39.543 --> 39:42.706
Excuse me. Pardon me.
I need to feel his chest.

39:42.780 --> 39:44.077
Can you feel his ribs?

39:44.148 --> 39:46.343
No, but I can if I press down.

39:46.417 --> 39:48.715
- What are you doing?
- Does he feel bloated?

39:48.786 --> 39:50.185
- I think so.
- Think what?

39:50.254 --> 39:53.746
Tell them you'll need a sharp
paring knife and a bottle of vodka.

39:53.824 --> 39:56.258
I need a sharp paring knife
and a bottle of vodka.

39:56.327 --> 39:57.419
- Ivan?
- Yeah, got it.

39:57.495 --> 39:59.861
- What's wrong?
- It's a tension pneumothorax.

39:59.930 --> 40:02.160
- It's a tension nemothaxer.
- Pneumothorax.

40:02.233 --> 40:03.894
- Pneumothaxer.
- Pneumothorax.

40:03.968 --> 40:05.265
- Pneumathurman.
- Never mind.

40:05.336 --> 40:07.998
- Never mind!
- But what is it?

40:08.072 --> 40:10.336
Air is escaping
out of the lungs into his chest.

40:10.408 --> 40:12.137
...out of his lungs into his chest.

40:12.209 --> 40:13.836
- Open his shirt.
- Open his shirt.

40:13.911 --> 40:15.378
- No, you do it.
- I'll do it.

40:15.446 --> 40:18.438
A valve at the opening of the lungs.
If it doesn't close,

40:18.516 --> 40:21.747
it constricts the lungs
and compresses the organs.

40:21.819 --> 40:24.947
I want you to feel for his ribs
again. A little bit lower.

40:25.022 --> 40:27.320
The spot between two ribs,
do you feel that?

40:27.391 --> 40:29.450
OK, splash some vodka on it.

40:29.527 --> 40:31.859
- All right. Get the knife.
- OK.

40:33.831 --> 40:36.732
Can I ask everyone just
to stand back a little bit here?

40:36.801 --> 40:39.964
A little bit further, please.
A little bit further. Thank you.

40:40.037 --> 40:42.972
- What am I doing with the knife?
- Make an incision.

40:43.040 --> 40:45.167
You know what? No.

40:45.242 --> 40:48.643
- David, this man's life is at stake.
- I... I can't stab a man.

40:48.712 --> 40:50.907
OK. There's nothing to be afraid of.

40:50.981 --> 40:53.381
You're gonna make
a hole for the air to escape.

40:53.451 --> 40:55.646
So put the knife on that spot.

40:55.719 --> 40:57.448
Oh, my God.
How do you know this?

40:57.521 --> 41:00.854
I don't know, I just do. Now do it!
Put the knife there.

41:00.925 --> 41:03.553
Now, you're gonna need
to push harder than that.

41:03.627 --> 41:05.288
- A little bit harder.
- Oh, God!

41:05.362 --> 41:06.920
OK! OK, good! That's enough.

41:06.997 --> 41:09.989
All right, now, take the pourer
out of the vodka bottle.

41:10.067 --> 41:12.001
- What?
- You're doing good. Now...

41:12.069 --> 41:13.127
Hold on.

41:17.174 --> 41:19.506
- Go.
- Put the pourer in the hole you made.

41:19.577 --> 41:20.566
What?

41:20.644 --> 41:23.374
It's gonna keep the wound open
so air can escape. Do it!

41:23.447 --> 41:25.438
- I can't.
- Do it.

41:28.619 --> 41:30.587
- He's breathing.
- He's breathing!

41:30.654 --> 41:32.281
He's breathing!

41:32.356 --> 41:33.789
I'm a doctor.

41:33.858 --> 41:34.950
I'm a doctor!

41:35.025 --> 41:38.688
I know. Thank God. The ambulance
will be here right away.

41:38.762 --> 41:40.889
Ask him where the nearest hospital is.

41:40.965 --> 41:43.024
Do you know where
the nearest hospital is?

41:43.100 --> 41:44.590
A few blocks, St. Matthews.

41:44.668 --> 41:46.659
- Thank you.
- St. Matthews?

41:46.737 --> 41:50.104
I may have been a home-wrecking
whore, but I saved lives.

41:50.174 --> 41:53.439
I worked in that hospital.
I know it, it sounds so familiar.

41:53.511 --> 41:56.105
- I've never saved a life before.
- It's the best.

41:56.180 --> 41:59.445
One minute you're looking at
this monitor, it says "game over,"

41:59.517 --> 42:02.111
then you bring it back,
a little blip and it's there!

42:02.186 --> 42:05.019
- What's that?
- That's just a little blood.

42:08.125 --> 42:09.114
David?

42:14.798 --> 42:17.460
- I work here.
- You did?

42:17.535 --> 42:20.368
The receptionist, her name is Amita.

42:20.437 --> 42:22.029
It's all coming back to me now.

42:22.106 --> 42:24.074
There's Bill and Karen

42:24.141 --> 42:26.575
and Michael and...

42:26.644 --> 42:29.977
Elizabeth? You mean Elizabeth Masterson?

42:30.047 --> 42:33.983
- Masterson. Yes, that's my name.
- Yes, that's it. Elizabeth Masterson.

42:35.352 --> 42:38.014
Dr. Masterson is...

42:38.088 --> 42:41.854
...is not active on our staff right now.

42:41.926 --> 42:44.258
Hold on. Let me talk to someone.

42:46.130 --> 42:47.222
Excuse me, doctor?

42:47.298 --> 42:48.890
Oh, no, she's got the tone.

42:48.966 --> 42:50.399
- What tone?
- The tone.

42:50.467 --> 42:53.163
You're trying to pass the buck
onto somebody else

42:53.237 --> 42:55.228
to tell you your friend died!

42:55.306 --> 42:57.103
Excuse me, sir.

42:57.174 --> 43:00.905
I need you to go to
the third-floor nurses' station.

43:02.780 --> 43:05.578
Oh, no, it's Fran. She's my mentor.

43:05.649 --> 43:07.742
They wouldn't send us
here if it wasn't bad.

43:07.818 --> 43:09.046
- Mr. Abbott?
- Hi, yes.

43:09.119 --> 43:10.643
- Fran Lo.
- Nice to meet you.

43:10.721 --> 43:13.519
You've been inquiring
about Elizabeth Masterson?

43:13.591 --> 43:16.355
Right. Could you tell me
what happened to her?

43:16.427 --> 43:18.725
I need to know
your relationship with her.

43:18.796 --> 43:22.027
Tell her you're my boyfriend.
She can't tell you anything

43:22.099 --> 43:24.659
unless she knows
we're intimately connected.

43:24.735 --> 43:27.636
We were romantic with each other.

43:27.705 --> 43:30.606
- What do you mean?
- You know, boyfriend-girlfriend.

43:30.674 --> 43:32.733
I know what romantic means,

43:32.810 --> 43:35.745
but I... I have
a hard time believing that.

43:35.813 --> 43:37.747
- What? Why?
- What? Why?

43:37.815 --> 43:40.477
Elizabeth's whole life
was this hospital.

43:40.551 --> 43:42.075
"Was"? Did she say "was"?

43:42.152 --> 43:44.620
I don't know of a single date
she'd ever been on.

43:44.688 --> 43:48.249
We were fairly recent.
I live in her apartment...

43:48.325 --> 43:49.917
- David.
- Building.

43:49.994 --> 43:52.895
So, you don't know about the accident.

43:52.963 --> 43:54.954
Accident.

43:56.166 --> 43:58.760
Oh, God, David. I remember it.

43:59.903 --> 44:01.131
It was awful.

44:02.006 --> 44:04.270
I was... I've been away.

44:04.341 --> 44:06.571
It was three months ago.

44:06.644 --> 44:09.044
Three months.

44:09.113 --> 44:11.138
I'm sorry.

44:11.215 --> 44:14.981
I was away for awhile
on a business trip.

44:52.823 --> 44:54.347
Oh, my God.

44:55.893 --> 44:57.986
What was that?
You were, like, flying.

45:00.197 --> 45:03.360
Oh, my God. It's you.

45:05.169 --> 45:06.966
It's you, it's really you.

45:07.037 --> 45:09.437
You're... you're not dead,
you're alive.

45:09.506 --> 45:12.202
I know, David, but I'm in a coma.
This is not good.

45:12.276 --> 45:14.073
Well, it's way better than dead.

45:14.144 --> 45:16.544
Look at you.
Your body is healing, it's...

45:16.613 --> 45:19.514
You don't have any scars.
You look pretty.

45:21.585 --> 45:23.382
It doesn't matter how I look.

45:23.454 --> 45:25.979
Three months,
that's a persistent coma.

45:26.056 --> 45:28.217
We're here now.
Let's do something.

45:28.292 --> 45:29.691
Like what?

45:29.760 --> 45:32.854
Like... I don't know.
You're the doctor.

45:32.930 --> 45:34.864
Right. Right.

45:37.267 --> 45:38.700
- Forget it.
- What?

45:38.769 --> 45:40.134
I was gonna say that we...

45:40.204 --> 45:43.230
I need to find a way
to put myself together again.

45:43.307 --> 45:46.674
OK, good, good. That's great.
How do we do that?

45:46.744 --> 45:48.803
Maybe I should try this.

45:53.884 --> 45:55.249
Something's happening!

45:55.319 --> 45:57.446
Yeah, yeah, yeah!
I think it's working!

45:57.521 --> 45:59.751
Yeah? No.

45:59.823 --> 46:01.552
Let me try again.

46:01.625 --> 46:03.058
I mean, really focus on it.

46:03.127 --> 46:05.095
Hold on inside there.

46:09.032 --> 46:10.693
I'm not sticking.

46:10.768 --> 46:13.430
It's like I'm no longer
connected to this body.

46:13.504 --> 46:16.701
All right, all right, all right,
all right. Turn around.

46:16.774 --> 46:18.708
- What?
- I want to try something.

46:18.776 --> 46:20.107
OK.

46:27.251 --> 46:28.309
You felt that.

46:28.385 --> 46:29.579
My hand tingled.

46:29.653 --> 46:32.247
You are still connected to your body.

46:32.322 --> 46:33.880
The monitor doesn't agree.

46:33.957 --> 46:35.584
Machines don't know everything.

46:35.659 --> 46:37.957
Everything in my training
tells me they do.

46:38.028 --> 46:40.053
Then how are we having
this conversation?

46:40.130 --> 46:42.394
I don't know.

46:42.466 --> 46:45.333
Mr. Abbott? I'm sorry.
I have an appointment,

46:45.402 --> 46:47.962
and I can't leave you here unattended.

46:48.038 --> 46:50.529
Can I just have a couple
more minutes, please?

46:50.607 --> 46:51.801
I'm saying goodbye.

46:51.875 --> 46:54.002
- Of course.
- Thank you.

46:54.077 --> 46:56.602
My nieces must have
made these things for me.

46:56.680 --> 46:59.649
Wow, that's an amazing likeness.

47:01.518 --> 47:03.577
Look at this.

47:03.654 --> 47:06.316
That's the picture
from my nightstand.

47:06.390 --> 47:07.857
Abby must have brought it.

47:07.925 --> 47:09.222
You look great.

47:12.496 --> 47:13.895
Look at me now.

47:15.299 --> 47:17.893
These levels aren't changing, David.

47:17.968 --> 47:19.959
If anything, they're decreasing.

47:22.806 --> 47:25.536
- I'm gonna have to leave soon.
- All right.

47:25.609 --> 47:28.271
Want me to wait
downstairs in the lobby?

47:28.345 --> 47:31.542
No, no, that's sweet.
You should go.

47:31.615 --> 47:33.242
Thank you for helping me.

47:33.317 --> 47:35.512
It was my pleasure.

47:36.520 --> 47:39.318
Are you sure you don't want
to come back with me?

47:39.389 --> 47:41.857
After all,
it is your apartment. It's fine.

47:42.926 --> 47:45.861
After I made it here, I...

47:45.929 --> 47:48.727
...can't imagine
leaving myself, you know?

47:48.799 --> 47:50.289
OK, I know, I just...

47:50.367 --> 47:52.699
Itjust feels weird
leaving you here alone.

47:53.937 --> 47:55.905
I don't know where else I belong.

47:55.973 --> 47:59.374
Mr. Abbott. I'm sorry.

48:03.247 --> 48:05.044
Goodbye, Elizabeth.

48:08.151 --> 48:09.482
Goodbye.

48:17.027 --> 48:19.154
Oh, I hate this.

48:19.229 --> 48:21.288
She finally gets a life, and then...

48:21.365 --> 48:23.265
You know what?
That guy was cute.

48:23.333 --> 48:26.302
At least she got a chance
to hang with him for a little while.

48:26.370 --> 48:29.533
Yeah. It woulda been awful
if she'd gone through her whole life

48:29.606 --> 48:32.507
not knowing what it was all about.

48:48.692 --> 48:51.252
Oh, my God. Jenny?

48:51.328 --> 48:54.320
No wonder
I could never find you.

49:01.872 --> 49:03.362
I guess you got my job.

49:03.440 --> 49:06.932
Yeah. I think I've earned it.
I deserve it.

49:07.010 --> 49:08.978
Everything
you thought it would be?

49:09.046 --> 49:12.880
It is. And it's time to upgrade
from the 330 to the 740.

49:12.950 --> 49:15.475
I'm goin' to the dealer tonight.

49:15.552 --> 49:18.020
Hold on. It's Walsh,
I have to take this.

49:18.088 --> 49:19.419
Hello?

49:19.489 --> 49:21.821
Really? You want me to do it?

49:23.226 --> 49:24.818
Sure, of course I can.

49:30.233 --> 49:33.168
Dude, did you know I can get
a built-in jack for my iPod?

49:33.236 --> 49:35.670
Did you know there's
people out there dying?

49:35.739 --> 49:38.902
- I'm in a coma, have you noticed?
- I know. Sweet!

49:46.750 --> 49:49.310
Zoe? Lily Vanilli?

49:50.487 --> 49:53.320
Oh, my God,
you guys got so big!

49:55.592 --> 49:56.786
Beat ya!

49:56.860 --> 49:58.521
- Did not!
- Did too!

49:58.595 --> 50:00.187
- Did not!
- Did too!

50:00.263 --> 50:01.355
Did not!
Did too!

50:01.431 --> 50:03.365
How could I feel him
and not you guys?

50:03.433 --> 50:04.798
- Did not!
- Did too!

50:04.868 --> 50:07.200
- Oh, that's funny.
- Abby.

50:07.270 --> 50:09.602
I remember saying
no running, no screaming!

50:09.673 --> 50:12.471
- Abby, can you feel me?
- All right, chill, I'm serious.

50:12.542 --> 50:13.975
I guess not.

50:14.044 --> 50:16.877
- I hope you feel better.
- Get well soon.

50:16.947 --> 50:18.209
I love you.

50:18.281 --> 50:20.749
I remember when you pushed us...

50:20.817 --> 50:22.876
It's so sweet you guys
come and visit me.

50:22.953 --> 50:25.615
- And I really miss...
- Excuse me.

50:25.689 --> 50:27.350
- Mrs. Brody, hi.
- Hi.

50:27.424 --> 50:30.154
Dr. Rushton.
Could I have a quick word?

50:30.227 --> 50:32.889
- Sure.
- What do you want?

50:32.963 --> 50:36.421
First of all, I hope you know how much
we all love and miss Elizabeth.

50:36.500 --> 50:39.025
Please. He's doing
high fives he's not in Phoenix.

50:39.102 --> 50:41.764
Because she was
a senior resident here,

50:41.838 --> 50:44.033
we've taken some
extraordinary measures

50:44.107 --> 50:47.406
to make her feel more comfortable
these last three months.

50:47.477 --> 50:49.843
Lily! Turn it back!

50:49.913 --> 50:51.403
Zoe, what did we talk about?

50:51.481 --> 50:53.540
Watch your sister. Sorry.

50:54.985 --> 50:56.748
This is hard to say.

50:56.820 --> 50:59.414
When we come to work here,

50:59.489 --> 51:01.548
we are asked to sign release forms.

51:01.625 --> 51:02.853
OK.

51:02.926 --> 51:04.553
I don't like the sound of this.

51:04.628 --> 51:08.189
Did you know your sister's opinion
about artificially prolonging life?

51:09.866 --> 51:11.766
- No.
- She was against it.

51:11.835 --> 51:12.893
Really?

51:12.969 --> 51:15.529
OK, that was before.
I am completely for it now.

51:15.605 --> 51:18.802
Honestly, most in our
profession feel that way.

51:18.875 --> 51:21.400
Not me! I'm perfectly happy.

51:21.478 --> 51:22.809
Come on, Abby!

51:22.879 --> 51:25.006
You have got to feel me,
I'm your sister!

51:25.082 --> 51:27.915
But there's still some
brain activity, isn't there?

51:27.984 --> 51:30.179
People have woken up
from this kind of coma.

51:30.253 --> 51:32.551
- All the time.
- Not on any record I've found.

51:32.622 --> 51:36.558
Of course they have!
Otherwise, what am I doing here?

51:36.626 --> 51:38.856
I feel car sick.

51:38.929 --> 51:41.762
- What are you doing?
- We're looking for the stick.

51:41.832 --> 51:42.821
What stick?

51:42.899 --> 51:46.027
- You said she had a stick up her...
- Stop it! Come on.

51:46.103 --> 51:48.765
TV is going to become
a very dim memory for you two.

51:48.839 --> 51:51.103
Mrs. Brody,
Elizabeth did sign a release.

51:51.174 --> 51:53.142
Because of the special situation,

51:53.210 --> 51:56.805
we won't take any terminal action
without your explicit approval.

51:56.880 --> 51:58.939
Now, I've prepared this paperwork...

51:59.015 --> 52:00.448
Don't sign that. I'm here!

52:00.517 --> 52:03.077
...if you decide to sign...
- I'll think about it.

52:03.153 --> 52:05.917
Abby, I'll baby-sit more, I swear!

52:05.989 --> 52:07.889
Those jeans you love?
They're yours!

52:07.958 --> 52:09.949
We sometimes find that it's easier

52:10.026 --> 52:13.359
just to ask God's forgiveness
and not prolong the inevitable.

52:13.430 --> 52:14.920
I said I'd think about it.

52:16.733 --> 52:18.667
Thank you, Abby.

52:18.735 --> 52:20.600
You always looked out for me.

52:32.549 --> 52:33.948
You here?

52:38.488 --> 52:39.887
I guess not.

53:36.613 --> 53:38.410
I'm locked out.

53:59.336 --> 54:02.703
Doesn't this location
make San Francisco bearable?

54:02.772 --> 54:05.570
Wait, you're not from here,
are you? Oh, good.

54:05.642 --> 54:08.236
And what's with all
the single men in this town?

54:08.311 --> 54:11.940
Every time I meet
a good-looking guy... lesbian.

54:12.015 --> 54:13.448
It's tough.

54:13.516 --> 54:16.576
I'd get on the phone and I'd be like,

54:16.653 --> 54:18.587
"Hello? Osama?

54:18.655 --> 54:20.589
Communism is so over.

54:20.657 --> 54:23.091
Like, give your people toilet paper."

54:23.159 --> 54:25.093
So, like, if I had to choose?

54:25.161 --> 54:26.651
If I had to choose.

54:28.331 --> 54:29.662
Wow.

54:30.934 --> 54:33.198
I guess I'd have to go
with the midget.

54:33.270 --> 54:35.329
I'm sorry...

54:36.106 --> 54:38.438
The locksmith,
does he know to ring my unit?

54:40.543 --> 54:41.874
I think so.

54:43.413 --> 54:44.675
Where's your bathroom?

54:44.748 --> 54:47.239
- It's right down the hall there.
- OK.

54:59.562 --> 55:00.893
- Elizabeth!
- Yeah.

55:00.964 --> 55:03.797
No, I just... I didn't think
you were gonna come back.

55:03.867 --> 55:07.132
I thought you were gonna stay
at the hospital with your body.

55:07.203 --> 55:10.366
It's terrible. They're trying
to get my sister to sign papers

55:10.440 --> 55:13.500
authorizing permission
to take me off of life support.

55:13.576 --> 55:16.306
- No! What? They can't do that!
- I know. I said that.

55:16.379 --> 55:17.641
Nobody could hear me.

55:17.714 --> 55:19.648
And I just wanted to talk to you.

55:19.716 --> 55:21.980
- David!
- Just a minute!

55:22.052 --> 55:25.180
Well, that didn't take very long.

55:25.255 --> 55:26.654
No.

55:26.723 --> 55:28.452
No, she barged in.

55:28.525 --> 55:30.618
She got locked out of her apartment.

55:30.694 --> 55:34.152
- You don't have to explain. I get it.
- No, you don't get anything.

55:34.230 --> 55:35.754
She's using the bathroom...

55:35.832 --> 55:38.266
Her voice sounded
like it came from the bedroom.

55:38.335 --> 55:39.529
It did?

55:39.903 --> 55:42.701
Come here.
I want to show you something.

55:43.473 --> 55:45.600
When you know, you know, right?

55:45.675 --> 55:48.303
I had no idea that's...

55:48.378 --> 55:50.539
You had no idea
she was naked on your bed.

55:50.613 --> 55:51.944
No.

55:53.883 --> 55:55.942
You're wondering
what she looks like.

55:56.019 --> 55:57.316
- No, I'm not.
- A little?

55:57.387 --> 55:59.150
Not enough to go look.

55:59.222 --> 56:01.520
Tell you what.
I'll do a little recon for ya.

56:01.591 --> 56:04.219
- Please don't!
- Don't worry. I'm a doctor.

56:04.294 --> 56:07.786
- Elizabeth. No, no, no, no, no.
- Relax.

56:10.567 --> 56:12.296
She's got a tattoo on her ass.

56:14.437 --> 56:15.734
It says "All aboard."

56:15.805 --> 56:18.171
- Really?
- In three languages.

56:18.241 --> 56:20.573
- Oh, that's funny.
- She's very cultural.

56:20.643 --> 56:22.235
You know, you sound jealous.

56:22.312 --> 56:24.177
- Oh, please.
- You do.

56:24.247 --> 56:26.374
Are you talkin' to someone?

56:27.117 --> 56:30.348
- Hey, what's goin' on?
- Eyes up top, David.

56:31.521 --> 56:33.216
Nothing.

56:33.289 --> 56:36.349
Look, I'm sorry if I'm coming on
a little too strong.

56:36.426 --> 56:38.417
That's just my style.

56:38.495 --> 56:40.190
I hear you sometimes.

56:40.263 --> 56:43.130
Up here...

56:43.199 --> 56:44.860
...by yourself...

56:46.536 --> 56:48.868
And I just figured...

56:48.938 --> 56:50.667
...maybe he's lonely.

56:50.740 --> 56:52.332
I know I am.

56:53.176 --> 56:55.736
Is it wrong for me
to want to touch someone?

56:55.812 --> 56:57.473
To be close?

56:57.547 --> 57:00.744
Feel a warm body next to me?

57:00.817 --> 57:02.785
David, just do it.

57:02.852 --> 57:03.910
What?

57:03.987 --> 57:06.922
Go ahead, be with her.
It's what you both want.

57:06.990 --> 57:09.823
- No, it isn't.
- Are you all right?

57:10.393 --> 57:13.885
Do you... wanna take
some kind of medication first?

57:13.963 --> 57:15.225
It's cool if you do.

57:15.298 --> 57:17.425
David, it's OK.

57:17.500 --> 57:20.492
She's beautiful, and she's
right here in front of you.

57:20.570 --> 57:22.902
- And I'm in the way.
- No, you're not.

57:22.972 --> 57:25.839
Elizabeth. Elizabeth!

57:31.247 --> 57:32.908
It's Katrina.

57:46.161 --> 57:47.685
That was quick.

57:48.830 --> 57:50.627
Come on, nothing happened.

57:53.501 --> 57:55.628
What'd you say to her?

57:58.039 --> 57:59.768
That I was seeing someone.

58:01.376 --> 58:02.968
Honestly?

58:03.445 --> 58:07.142
Well, I didn't mention
that I was the only person who could.

58:12.721 --> 58:14.450
You know, I haven't...

58:15.790 --> 58:18.190
...haven't really been
with anyone since...

58:18.259 --> 58:19.920
...since Laura.

58:22.330 --> 58:24.525
She was cursing at her shoe.

58:25.767 --> 58:27.496
Her heel had broken.

58:30.538 --> 58:33.735
And then she just kinda sat down

58:33.808 --> 58:36.038
and put her hand to her head.

58:36.111 --> 58:38.238
Cerebral hemorrhage?

58:43.018 --> 58:45.009
And...

58:48.823 --> 58:50.814
I couldn't do anything to help her.

58:51.893 --> 58:53.622
She was, like, gone.

58:53.695 --> 58:56.425
I couldn't even say goodbye,
and she was just...

58:57.165 --> 58:58.564
She's gone.

59:05.040 --> 59:06.769
What was she like?

59:07.842 --> 59:10.777
You know, she was just
a big pain in the ass.

59:11.579 --> 59:12.978
No, really.

59:13.048 --> 59:15.983
I mean, the bras on the doorknobs,

59:16.051 --> 59:19.851
leaving the car with the...
with the gas needle below empty.

59:19.921 --> 59:23.049
She couldn't put gas in the car.
It was impossible for her.

59:23.124 --> 59:27.686
And just total stubborn inability
to master a remote.

59:27.762 --> 59:30.094
So she would just
randomly click buttons,

59:30.165 --> 59:34.158
until the TV was snarled into
some unmanageable condition.

59:34.235 --> 59:36.760
I mean, I'm so...

59:36.838 --> 59:38.931
I'm mad just thinking...

59:42.277 --> 59:43.608
...thinking about her.

59:46.548 --> 59:48.209
I'm sorry, David.

59:49.951 --> 59:53.148
Your sister really wouldn't
sign those papers, would she?

59:53.221 --> 59:55.212
I don't know.

59:56.291 --> 59:57.952
I hope not.

59:59.694 --> 01:00:02.288
Won't even matter
if I don't wake up soon.

01:00:02.363 --> 01:00:04.991
My brain activity's
decreasing every day.

01:00:05.066 --> 01:00:07.159
Maybe that's not such a bad thing.

01:00:07.235 --> 01:00:09.328
You're kind of a smarty-pants.

01:00:10.105 --> 01:00:12.198
No, it'll bring you down to my level.

01:00:12.273 --> 01:00:15.401
You're not dumb, David,
just a little lazy.

01:00:15.477 --> 01:00:17.536
Cute, but lazy.

01:00:17.612 --> 01:00:18.738
Thank you.

01:00:19.848 --> 01:00:22.043
I wasn't always like this, you know.

01:00:23.184 --> 01:00:24.879
What were you like?

01:00:29.124 --> 01:00:30.921
Come on.

01:00:30.992 --> 01:00:32.857
I want to show you something.

01:00:44.539 --> 01:00:46.530
- Where are we?
- It's an estate.

01:00:46.608 --> 01:00:48.667
The guy's in Hawaii this time of year.

01:00:48.743 --> 01:00:52.144
- Are we trespassing?
- Don't worry, we're not going inside.

01:00:53.181 --> 01:00:54.512
Here it is.

01:01:01.356 --> 01:01:03.290
You said you love gardens.

01:01:03.358 --> 01:01:04.950
What is this place?

01:01:05.026 --> 01:01:07.085
I made this place.

01:01:09.430 --> 01:01:10.897
This is my work.

01:01:11.766 --> 01:01:15.031
I was a landscape architect.
I had my own company for awhile.

01:01:16.971 --> 01:01:18.734
David, I've been here before.

01:01:19.707 --> 01:01:20.833
What do you mean?

01:01:20.909 --> 01:01:23.241
I know this is gonna
sound really strange,

01:01:23.311 --> 01:01:25.836
but I dreamed of this place.

01:01:27.315 --> 01:01:30.307
These flowers, everything.

01:01:31.186 --> 01:01:33.450
It's beautiful.

01:01:33.521 --> 01:01:35.785
I had no idea, David.

01:01:35.857 --> 01:01:38.587
What a joy it must be
to create a place like this.

01:01:40.762 --> 01:01:42.093
Yeah, it was.

01:01:42.163 --> 01:01:43.687
Is it gonna be again?

01:01:45.333 --> 01:01:46.357
Sure.

01:01:46.434 --> 01:01:47.924
Promise?

01:02:05.687 --> 01:02:07.587
Who the hell's calling me?

01:02:07.655 --> 01:02:09.122
Hello?

01:02:09.190 --> 01:02:10.589
David, it's Grace.

01:02:10.658 --> 01:02:13.889
Well, you are the luckiest man
in San Francisco.

01:02:13.962 --> 01:02:16.430
Thank you. Why do you say that?

01:02:16.497 --> 01:02:18.465
Great news, the apartment is yours.

01:02:18.533 --> 01:02:21.161
And they're willing
to give you a nice long lease.

01:02:21.236 --> 01:02:22.567
How long a lease?

01:02:22.637 --> 01:02:24.764
Really long.
And I'm gonna send it over,

01:02:24.839 --> 01:02:27.535
- and I'll talk to you tomorrow.
- Wait, wait, wait.

01:02:27.609 --> 01:02:29.668
Why are they giving me
a long lease now?

01:02:29.744 --> 01:02:33.111
It's a terrible story. The tenant
was in some kind of coma,

01:02:33.181 --> 01:02:35.877
and it is what it is,
so they're gonna pull the plug.

01:02:35.950 --> 01:02:39.977
But get this: They are gonna
throw in that couch you like.

01:02:40.054 --> 01:02:42.284
- David?
- What?

01:02:42.357 --> 01:02:43.984
We gotta go talk to your sister.

01:02:44.058 --> 01:02:45.889
Why? What are you gonna say to her?

01:02:45.960 --> 01:02:48.292
I don't know. What kind of dirt
do you have on her?

01:02:48.363 --> 01:02:50.194
Her middle name is Ellen.

01:02:50.265 --> 01:02:53.996
In the third grade she told everybody
it was Leia, like Princess Leia.

01:02:54.068 --> 01:02:55.262
What else?

01:02:56.537 --> 01:02:58.471
She's lactose intolerant.

01:02:58.539 --> 01:03:00.598
All right, the only way
this is gonna work

01:03:00.675 --> 01:03:03.235
is if I could tell her something
that only you know.

01:03:03.311 --> 01:03:06.075
Something so intimate, so personal...

01:03:06.147 --> 01:03:10.083
She French-kissed her ex-boyfriend J.J.
Five minutes before her wedding.

01:03:10.151 --> 01:03:11.812
Oh, that'll work. That's good.

01:03:11.886 --> 01:03:15.014
- Nobody knows that.
- That... I think I like her already.

01:03:22.063 --> 01:03:25.464
So, how did you know Elizabeth?
You must've worked together.

01:03:25.533 --> 01:03:29.492
- God knows she wasn't dating anybody.
- Everybody likes to rub that one in.

01:03:29.570 --> 01:03:32.835
Actually, this is gonna be
a little difficult to swallow...

01:03:32.907 --> 01:03:33.965
Tea!

01:03:34.042 --> 01:03:36.875
My nieces are here?
They're supposed to be at school.

01:03:36.944 --> 01:03:38.809
- Hi.
- Would you like some tea, sir?

01:03:38.880 --> 01:03:40.507
Well, yes, thank you, madam.

01:03:40.581 --> 01:03:44.176
Abort. Don't do this in front of them,
it's gonna freak them out.

01:03:44.252 --> 01:03:47.187
I'm sorry, you were saying?
How did you know her?

01:03:47.255 --> 01:03:49.280
- Lie your butt off.
- We worked together.

01:03:49.357 --> 01:03:50.551
- No!
- No.

01:03:50.625 --> 01:03:53.788
No, no, no. You're not credible
as a doctor. Make something up.

01:03:53.861 --> 01:03:57.262
I mean, I didn't work with her.
We worked together on my illness.

01:03:57.332 --> 01:03:58.629
I was a patient of hers.

01:03:58.700 --> 01:04:00.964
Lily? Can you see me?

01:04:01.035 --> 01:04:03.833
I was sick. I had meningitis.

01:04:03.905 --> 01:04:05.668
Spiral meningitis.

01:04:05.740 --> 01:04:07.071
I'm so sorry.

01:04:07.141 --> 01:04:09.166
Spiral meningitis?
It's not a disease.

01:04:09.243 --> 01:04:11.677
Oh, no, it's OK.
I'm much better now.

01:04:11.746 --> 01:04:12.735
I...

01:04:12.814 --> 01:04:14.941
Elizabeth, she believed in me,

01:04:15.016 --> 01:04:18.417
believed that I would recover
when nobody else did.

01:04:18.486 --> 01:04:19.953
And then I did.

01:04:20.021 --> 01:04:21.955
That sounds just like her.

01:04:22.023 --> 01:04:24.856
But why are you telling me this?

01:04:26.027 --> 01:04:29.895
Because I know about
Elizabeth's situation,

01:04:29.964 --> 01:04:32.558
and I just wanna say that...

01:04:32.633 --> 01:04:34.260
Lily.

01:04:34.335 --> 01:04:37.270
...there are things...
- You know I'm here, don't you?

01:04:37.338 --> 01:04:38.930
...sometimes that...

01:04:39.006 --> 01:04:41.304
...that are beyond our understanding.

01:04:43.077 --> 01:04:46.069
And so, I just wanted to ask you...

01:04:46.147 --> 01:04:49.241
Actually, I just want to beg you

01:04:49.317 --> 01:04:52.081
to... to give her
a little bit more time.

01:04:52.153 --> 01:04:54.451
She's gonna pull through this thing.

01:04:54.522 --> 01:04:56.012
I just know it.

01:04:56.090 --> 01:04:58.081
That's really sweet of you to say,

01:04:58.159 --> 01:05:01.287
but... it's kinda too late.

01:05:01.362 --> 01:05:02.454
Abby.

01:05:02.530 --> 01:05:04.794
- What do you mean?
- Abby, what did you do?

01:05:05.800 --> 01:05:07.199
It's David, right?

01:05:08.503 --> 01:05:12.405
You see, it's too late because
I've already signed the papers.

01:05:12.473 --> 01:05:14.998
Abby. I'm here.

01:05:15.076 --> 01:05:16.941
Can you feel me? I'm right here.

01:05:17.011 --> 01:05:19.741
We're terminating life support
tomorrow at noon,

01:05:19.814 --> 01:05:22.078
while the girls are in school.

01:05:22.150 --> 01:05:25.210
I mean, the past three months
have been so hard on them,

01:05:25.286 --> 01:05:26.776
on this whole family.

01:05:26.854 --> 01:05:28.845
Well, I understand that. I really do.

01:05:28.923 --> 01:05:31.414
But I think you're makin'
a grave mistake here,

01:05:31.492 --> 01:05:34.893
- because I really believe...
- It's for the best. Really.

01:05:34.962 --> 01:05:36.520
This is what Elizabeth wanted.

01:05:37.899 --> 01:05:41.357
I mean, I spent my whole life thinking
I knew what was best for her.

01:05:41.436 --> 01:05:44.928
What she should wear,
what men she should date.

01:05:46.674 --> 01:05:48.801
This is the last thing
Elizabeth asked for.

01:05:50.178 --> 01:05:53.978
And for the first time in my life,
I'm gonna respect her wishes.

01:05:55.917 --> 01:05:58.249
Oh, Abby.

01:05:58.319 --> 01:05:59.718
Look.

01:06:00.788 --> 01:06:03.484
This is gonna sound
really strange to you, but...

01:06:03.558 --> 01:06:04.547
Oh, no, no, no.

01:06:04.625 --> 01:06:07.253
...the truth is Elizabeth
is here with us right now.

01:06:07.328 --> 01:06:11.788
She came here with me, she's standing
next to you, begging you to wait.

01:06:11.866 --> 01:06:13.731
Right next to me?

01:06:13.801 --> 01:06:15.792
- Right there.
- David, stop.

01:06:15.870 --> 01:06:18.065
No, let me do this.
I don't know how or why,

01:06:18.139 --> 01:06:20.437
but somehow I can see
your sister's spirit.

01:06:20.508 --> 01:06:23.500
I know it's crazy,
but I also can talk to her.

01:06:23.578 --> 01:06:26.979
So why don't I have herjust
explain the whole thing to you,

01:06:27.048 --> 01:06:28.345
and I'll translate.

01:06:31.352 --> 01:06:33.547
Could you just hold on, just a sec?

01:06:36.424 --> 01:06:39.552
OK, tea party's over.
Time for Wiggly Safari!

01:06:39.627 --> 01:06:41.185
Yeah!

01:06:41.762 --> 01:06:45.289
- OK, David, this could work.
- I think I was getting through to her.

01:06:45.366 --> 01:06:48.767
- You need to get her to the hospital.
- Right to the hospital.

01:06:48.836 --> 01:06:52.772
- We'll get her to rip those papers...
- Get the hell outta here, you freak!

01:06:53.641 --> 01:06:56.075
I'm not makin' this up!
Why would I?

01:06:56.143 --> 01:06:57.974
Abby, calm down,
just calm down!

01:06:58.045 --> 01:07:00.343
I'll chop you!
I swear, I will chop you!

01:07:00.414 --> 01:07:02.177
- Tell about J.J.
- I know about J.J.

01:07:02.250 --> 01:07:04.775
- What?
- I know what you did with J.J.

01:07:04.852 --> 01:07:07.412
I'll tell everybody.

01:07:07.488 --> 01:07:09.581
How do you know that?
Nobody knows that!

01:07:09.657 --> 01:07:11.625
Get outta here! Get going!

01:07:18.266 --> 01:07:19.733
You kids OK?

01:07:19.800 --> 01:07:24.260
Mommy, is Auntie Elizabeth
gonna have more tea?

01:07:26.207 --> 01:07:27.538
What?

01:07:41.022 --> 01:07:44.082
I don't think your sister's
a very spiritual person.

01:07:44.158 --> 01:07:45.682
She's just bein' a good mom.

01:07:45.760 --> 01:07:48.285
Tryin' to keep her kids away
from a crazy guy.

01:07:52.967 --> 01:07:55.299
I think I would have liked
to have been a mom.

01:07:55.369 --> 01:07:56.836
You'd make a good one.

01:07:58.039 --> 01:07:59.063
Thanks.

01:08:01.642 --> 01:08:03.269
Guess I'll never really know.

01:08:03.344 --> 01:08:06.108
Come on, Lizzie. This can't be it.

01:08:06.180 --> 01:08:08.171
- Lizzie?
- OK, I'm sorry.

01:08:08.249 --> 01:08:10.376
I know you don't like
to be called that.

01:08:10.451 --> 01:08:11.679
I'm warming up to it.

01:08:13.054 --> 01:08:14.487
I can go to that hospital.

01:08:14.555 --> 01:08:16.955
I could talk to your friend, Fran.
I could...

01:08:17.024 --> 01:08:19.219
- No, David.
...talk to the asshole guy.

01:08:19.292 --> 01:08:22.524
Brett? No. Just stop,
They'll put you in a straitjacket.

01:08:22.596 --> 01:08:25.725
There's no way anyone's
gonna believe I'm still here.

01:08:25.800 --> 01:08:28.029
Your niece, the little girl.
She saw you.

01:08:28.102 --> 01:08:29.363
Oh, great.

01:08:29.437 --> 01:08:31.667
My fate's in the hands
of a four-year-old

01:08:31.738 --> 01:08:33.934
who has seven other
imaginary friends.

01:08:34.942 --> 01:08:36.933
Wait. There is someone else.

01:08:37.011 --> 01:08:38.410
What do you mean?

01:08:38.479 --> 01:08:39.810
Come on.

01:08:41.749 --> 01:08:43.444
- Darryl!
- Dude.

01:08:43.517 --> 01:08:46.314
- Yeah.
- The spirit's with you, isn't it?

01:08:46.386 --> 01:08:48.981
You can't bring that here.
What are you thinking?

01:08:49.055 --> 01:08:52.492
- You were right. She's alive.
- Righteous.

01:08:52.560 --> 01:08:55.495
She's in a coma. Her family's
gonna take her off life support.

01:08:55.563 --> 01:08:57.258
Not so righteous.

01:08:57.331 --> 01:09:00.630
So, what, are you guys
socializing now?

01:09:00.701 --> 01:09:03.693
We've... acclimated.

01:09:03.770 --> 01:09:05.761
Yeah, I can tell.

01:09:06.439 --> 01:09:11.502
In fact, I'm sensin' some pretty
intense feelings she has for you, bro.

01:09:11.578 --> 01:09:14.446
- Really?
- No, I don't.

01:09:14.515 --> 01:09:17.506
Major red aura.
Somebody's embarrassed.

01:09:17.585 --> 01:09:20.486
- I am not. Can we focus here?
- OK.

01:09:20.554 --> 01:09:23.990
- Ask him if there's a spell...
- Or a chant. Anything to get...

01:09:24.058 --> 01:09:26.117
- My spirit...
...back into her body?

01:09:26.193 --> 01:09:29.754
- You're asking the wrong question.
- Why is that wrong?

01:09:30.930 --> 01:09:32.796
Look, I have the gift.

01:09:32.867 --> 01:09:34.562
I didn't ask for it, but I do.

01:09:34.635 --> 01:09:36.330
I can sense these things,

01:09:36.404 --> 01:09:38.337
spirits, whatever
you wanna call 'em.

01:09:38.406 --> 01:09:40.738
Why they're hangin' here
in the first place?

01:09:40.808 --> 01:09:44.368
- That's their unfinished business.
- Do I have the gift?

01:09:44.444 --> 01:09:47.608
Dude, please.
You definitely don't have it.

01:09:47.682 --> 01:09:49.013
You're a civilian.

01:09:49.082 --> 01:09:52.348
But if I don't have it,
how is it that I can see her

01:09:52.420 --> 01:09:54.388
and talk to her
when no one else can?

01:09:54.455 --> 01:09:57.322
- Exactly.
- Exactly what?

01:09:57.391 --> 01:10:00.189
That's the right question.

01:10:00.261 --> 01:10:02.525
What the hell is he talking about?

01:10:02.596 --> 01:10:05.087
God, I feel like it's
right there in front of us.

01:10:05.166 --> 01:10:06.895
I just can't get a handle on it.

01:10:06.967 --> 01:10:10.425
How do you solve a problem
that isn't possible in the first place?

01:10:10.504 --> 01:10:13.564
Because nothing seems
impossible to me anymore.

01:10:13.641 --> 01:10:17.236
I mean, why did I move into
your apartment in the first place?

01:10:17.311 --> 01:10:19.643
Why can I see you
when no one else can?

01:10:19.714 --> 01:10:23.172
I mean, why was I down in that
restaurant when that guy collapsed?

01:10:23.250 --> 01:10:26.515
It all seems interrelated somehow.

01:10:26.587 --> 01:10:28.521
- What are you doing?
- I don't know.

01:10:28.589 --> 01:10:31.387
I feel like I missed something here.
Wait a second.

01:10:31.459 --> 01:10:34.292
Rosemary Preston lives
right here in San Francisco.

01:10:34.361 --> 01:10:35.589
We could go talk to her.

01:10:35.663 --> 01:10:38.131
I'll call Information,
maybe she's listed.

01:10:38.199 --> 01:10:39.427
Where did you get this?

01:10:41.602 --> 01:10:43.593
It was just at the hospital.

01:10:44.538 --> 01:10:46.870
Yeah. I...

01:10:48.609 --> 01:10:50.008
I took it.

01:10:51.479 --> 01:10:52.878
I'm sorry. I...

01:10:52.947 --> 01:10:54.278
I just...

01:10:54.348 --> 01:10:56.612
I wanted to have a picture of you.

01:10:57.885 --> 01:11:00.581
I wasn't sure that I was
gonna ever see you again.

01:11:00.654 --> 01:11:02.246
I'm sorry.

01:11:03.691 --> 01:11:05.022
Don't be sorry.

01:11:08.162 --> 01:11:09.686
That's really nice.

01:11:11.365 --> 01:11:13.424
I really like that picture.

01:11:14.502 --> 01:11:16.902
Yeah. Yeah, I liked it too.

01:11:18.239 --> 01:11:20.969
I had just gotten
my MCAT scores back.

01:11:21.041 --> 01:11:23.168
Well, you must've done well.

01:11:23.244 --> 01:11:26.645
No, actually, I bombed.
My scores were so low

01:11:26.714 --> 01:11:29.376
I couldn't even get into
correspondence school.

01:11:29.450 --> 01:11:31.748
- And that's a good thing?
- No.

01:11:31.819 --> 01:11:35.118
I know it sounds kinda crazy.
I wanted to go back to the library

01:11:35.189 --> 01:11:37.919
and start studying immediately,
but Abby said no.

01:11:37.992 --> 01:11:40.256
The only thing to do
was to burn my scores

01:11:40.327 --> 01:11:42.386
and drink margaritas.

01:11:43.330 --> 01:11:45.321
Lots and lots of margaritas.

01:11:45.399 --> 01:11:47.993
Well, looks like she was right.

01:11:48.068 --> 01:11:53.472
It's just funny because the one time
I completely failed at something,

01:11:53.541 --> 01:11:55.873
I had more fun
than I'd ever had in my life.

01:11:57.678 --> 01:11:59.339
You look happy.

01:12:01.615 --> 01:12:03.276
I was happy.

01:12:04.552 --> 01:12:07.214
But what was I doing
with the rest of my time?

01:12:07.288 --> 01:12:09.916
When I think about my life and I...

01:12:11.225 --> 01:12:13.159
All I can remember is working.

01:12:14.495 --> 01:12:16.690
You know? Working and working

01:12:16.764 --> 01:12:19.528
and trying so hard.

01:12:19.600 --> 01:12:21.465
And for what?

01:12:21.535 --> 01:12:23.594
You help people.

01:12:24.505 --> 01:12:25.972
You save lives.

01:12:26.040 --> 01:12:28.634
Yeah. Including my own.

01:12:28.709 --> 01:12:31.769
I saved my life, for later.

01:12:34.448 --> 01:12:36.177
I just...

01:12:36.250 --> 01:12:38.980
I never thought
there wouldn't be a later.

01:12:39.053 --> 01:12:41.544
No, don't say that.
There's still time.

01:12:41.622 --> 01:12:43.180
We're gonna see this lady...

01:12:43.257 --> 01:12:46.590
You know, I just don't want
to spend my last night crying.

01:12:47.328 --> 01:12:49.990
Or... fighting my fate.

01:12:51.298 --> 01:12:53.789
I wanna do something with you.

01:12:56.470 --> 01:12:59.200
OK. OK, great.

01:12:59.273 --> 01:13:00.535
What do you want to do?

01:13:00.608 --> 01:13:02.075
You want to fly to Paris?

01:13:02.142 --> 01:13:04.201
See the Eiffel Tower? No problem.

01:13:04.278 --> 01:13:07.270
You wanna dance on a beach
in Bali? Let's go! Let's do it!

01:13:07.348 --> 01:13:08.542
Anywhere in the world

01:13:08.616 --> 01:13:11.608
that will take MasterCard or Visa.

01:13:11.685 --> 01:13:13.016
Anywhere.

01:13:15.222 --> 01:13:17.554
There is something
that I would like to do.

01:13:19.026 --> 01:13:20.425
Anything.

01:13:22.162 --> 01:13:23.561
I'm so bad at this.

01:13:24.465 --> 01:13:26.023
What? What is it?

01:13:35.576 --> 01:13:37.237
Are you nervous?

01:13:38.979 --> 01:13:41.573
- A little.
- Why?

01:13:41.649 --> 01:13:43.048
I don't know.

01:13:44.451 --> 01:13:48.387
How can you be nervous
when I can't even touch you?

01:13:48.455 --> 01:13:52.391
I think I'm more nervous
because you can't touch me.

01:13:53.160 --> 01:13:54.491
Why?

01:13:56.497 --> 01:13:59.660
You know in the hospital
when you touched my hand?

01:14:00.567 --> 01:14:02.501
I felt it.

01:14:02.569 --> 01:14:05.902
I mean, my spirit felt it.

01:14:05.973 --> 01:14:07.964
I don't know how.

01:14:09.743 --> 01:14:12.712
But I think if you could
ever really touch me...

01:14:14.748 --> 01:14:17.012
...I might wake up from all of this.

01:14:35.035 --> 01:14:37.503
I can almost feel that.

01:14:37.571 --> 01:14:38.902
Me too.

01:14:40.641 --> 01:14:43.303
I think I know what
my unfinished business is.

01:14:43.377 --> 01:14:44.810
What?

01:14:46.714 --> 01:14:48.306
You.

01:15:13.340 --> 01:15:14.807
Elizabeth.

01:15:16.276 --> 01:15:17.971
Elizabeth?

01:15:18.045 --> 01:15:20.513
- Elizabeth?!
- I'm right here.

01:15:20.581 --> 01:15:23.072
Oh, good, good.
I thought you were gone.

01:15:23.150 --> 01:15:25.118
Suddenly I know
what I'm supposed to do,

01:15:25.185 --> 01:15:27.016
because this time
I can do something.

01:15:27.087 --> 01:15:28.714
What are you talking about?

01:15:28.789 --> 01:15:32.486
Lizzie, when we first met,
I kept saying that you were dead.

01:15:32.559 --> 01:15:35.289
But it was me that was dead,
and you brought me back.

01:15:35.362 --> 01:15:37.557
You saved me.

01:15:37.631 --> 01:15:39.394
And now it's my turn to save you.

01:15:39.466 --> 01:15:41.093
How?

01:15:41.168 --> 01:15:43.261
I'm gonna steal your body.

01:15:45.072 --> 01:15:46.664
David.

01:15:46.740 --> 01:15:50.574
David. David, what are you thinking?
You can't do this!

01:15:50.644 --> 01:15:52.942
- Why can't I?
- Because you'll go to jail.

01:15:53.013 --> 01:15:56.244
So? If something happens to you,
you think I care where I'll be?

01:15:56.316 --> 01:15:59.114
At least this'll buy us
a little more time.

01:16:00.354 --> 01:16:03.653
The things you'd have to know
to even start to pull this off...

01:16:03.724 --> 01:16:05.988
You know them.
You'll talk me through it.

01:16:07.528 --> 01:16:09.257
OK, you're gonna need a van.

01:16:09.329 --> 01:16:12.127
And somebody with no morals.

01:16:20.340 --> 01:16:22.865
- What are we movin' again?
- Medical supplies.

01:16:22.943 --> 01:16:25.036
You didn't tell him? You have to.

01:16:25.112 --> 01:16:27.103
You know,
he looks really familiar to me.

01:16:27.181 --> 01:16:29.979
- You saw him at the bar.
- Saw who at the bar?

01:16:30.050 --> 01:16:31.813
No one, never mind.
Here we go!

01:16:33.854 --> 01:16:37.312
OK, and we're in such a hurry
to move this stuff because why?

01:16:37.391 --> 01:16:40.724
There's a one-day sale on
hospital beds. I always wanted one.

01:16:40.794 --> 01:16:43.388
Oh, great. Now you're
gonna become a bed potato.

01:16:43.464 --> 01:16:45.762
- You've gotta tell this poor guy.
- Not yet.

01:16:45.833 --> 01:16:47.767
- Not yet what?
- We're not there yet.

01:16:47.835 --> 01:16:49.769
OK, Dave, be honest with me.

01:16:49.837 --> 01:16:52.431
Has your imaginary friend
come out to play?

01:17:00.180 --> 01:17:01.772
OK, grab a cart.

01:17:01.849 --> 01:17:04.784
You need a blood pressure cuff

01:17:04.852 --> 01:17:08.253
and a portable ventilator,
right there, that yellow thing.

01:17:08.322 --> 01:17:11.655
Dave, what the hell are you doing?
This isn't a sale, man!

01:17:11.725 --> 01:17:14.091
All right. I knew
you wouldn't come if I told you.

01:17:14.161 --> 01:17:18.029
- Do I really want to hear this?
- My imaginary friend is not imaginary.

01:17:18.098 --> 01:17:20.862
She is the spirit of a girl
in a coma upstairs

01:17:20.934 --> 01:17:23.266
who they're about
to take off life support.

01:17:23.337 --> 01:17:25.168
We've got to get her someplace safe.

01:17:25.239 --> 01:17:26.672
- Really?
- Really.

01:17:26.740 --> 01:17:29.607
- You should've told him.
- He wouldn't have believed me.

01:17:29.676 --> 01:17:32.804
- Does he believe you now?
- I had to get him into the hospital!

01:17:32.880 --> 01:17:36.281
Let me take you to the psych ward.
There are people who can help!

01:17:36.350 --> 01:17:40.377
No time. It's 11:30 right now.
She's gonna be dead in half an hour!

01:17:40.454 --> 01:17:42.183
Tell him I know this is a stretch.

01:17:42.256 --> 01:17:45.453
Elizabeth is standing
right behind you right now.

01:17:45.526 --> 01:17:47.619
She knows what a stretch
this is for you.

01:17:47.694 --> 01:17:49.628
If your friend's really behind me,

01:17:49.696 --> 01:17:52.426
ask her what I'm doing:
Rock, paper or scissors?

01:17:52.499 --> 01:17:54.023
- Rock.
- Rock.

01:17:54.868 --> 01:17:56.301
- Scissors.
- Scissors.

01:17:57.070 --> 01:17:58.162
- Paper.
- Paper.

01:17:58.939 --> 01:18:00.998
- Rock again.
- Rock again.

01:18:01.074 --> 01:18:03.736
- He's flipping me off.
- Are you flipping her off?

01:18:03.810 --> 01:18:06.574
- You're flipping her off!
- How...?

01:18:06.647 --> 01:18:09.309
OK. OK, sometimes
people with emotional

01:18:09.383 --> 01:18:12.375
and mental disturbances
can have psychic moments.

01:18:12.452 --> 01:18:13.749
But even if she was real,

01:18:13.820 --> 01:18:16.311
do you know what you're
risking for this woman?

01:18:16.390 --> 01:18:17.687
- Yes!
- Why?

01:18:19.593 --> 01:18:21.026
Because I love her.

01:18:22.062 --> 01:18:23.791
I love her.

01:18:23.864 --> 01:18:25.525
I do, I love you.

01:18:26.800 --> 01:18:29.268
No one's ever said that to me before.

01:18:36.076 --> 01:18:37.338
- David?
- What?

01:18:37.411 --> 01:18:40.209
- Tell him thank you.
- We're really grateful, Jack.

01:18:40.280 --> 01:18:41.577
I'm not doin' it for you.

01:18:41.648 --> 01:18:43.013
Then why are you doing it?

01:18:43.083 --> 01:18:46.382
Because someday, trust me,
I'm gonna need help movin' a body.

01:18:46.453 --> 01:18:49.513
When that day comes,
I don't wanna hear any shit from you.

01:18:52.626 --> 01:18:54.787
OK, get me on the gurney, quick.

01:18:54.861 --> 01:18:56.226
Oh, my God. David.

01:18:56.296 --> 01:18:57.854
I know. She's pretty, right?

01:18:57.931 --> 01:19:00.126
That's really sweet,
but we've gotta go.

01:19:00.200 --> 01:19:02.100
No, that's not it. This is her.

01:19:02.169 --> 01:19:05.900
This is the woman I set you up with,
the woman you stood up that night!

01:19:06.540 --> 01:19:08.030
I was gonna meet Elizabeth?

01:19:08.108 --> 01:19:11.441
And she didn't make it either,
because she had an accident.

01:19:12.512 --> 01:19:13.740
It was you.

01:19:13.814 --> 01:19:15.406
Is that it? Is that why?

01:19:15.482 --> 01:19:17.143
I was supposed to meet you.

01:19:18.252 --> 01:19:19.378
How did you know her?

01:19:19.453 --> 01:19:21.819
I'm friends with her sister.
We went out.

01:19:21.888 --> 01:19:26.325
- I knew I'd seen him. That's J.J.!
- Jack is J.J.?

01:19:26.393 --> 01:19:29.260
What did you...?
No one's called me J.J. Since college.

01:19:29.329 --> 01:19:31.320
He's older and hairier, but it's him.

01:19:31.398 --> 01:19:33.593
The one who tongued Abby
at the wedding?

01:19:33.667 --> 01:19:36.659
- How the hell did you know that?
- It's Elizabeth.

01:19:36.737 --> 01:19:40.070
- Oh, my God. She really is here.
- I told you!

01:19:40.140 --> 01:19:44.236
Get her on the gurney! I don't want them
killing Abby's sister! Come on.

01:19:44.311 --> 01:19:45.608
OK. Be really gentle.

01:19:47.014 --> 01:19:48.504
Yeah.

01:19:48.582 --> 01:19:49.913
I'm here already.

01:19:49.983 --> 01:19:52.110
- That's Brett.
- He's 15 minutes early!

01:19:52.185 --> 01:19:55.154
- Soon as the sister shows, we're ready.
- He's comin' in.

01:19:55.222 --> 01:19:56.814
That's OK. All right.

01:19:56.890 --> 01:19:59.484
- Careful, he's smart. His name is...
- Dr. Rushton?

01:19:59.559 --> 01:20:01.789
- Yeah.
- Well, hi, David Abbott.

01:20:01.862 --> 01:20:03.989
Buy some time.
Tell him you're a doctor.

01:20:04.064 --> 01:20:05.292
I'm a doctor.

01:20:05.365 --> 01:20:07.890
You're a special consultant
from PAC Medical.

01:20:07.968 --> 01:20:10.368
I'm a special consultant
from PAC Medical.

01:20:10.437 --> 01:20:12.997
Dr. Walsh sent me down
for a final evaluation.

01:20:13.073 --> 01:20:16.702
I had no verbal or written
instructions to that end.

01:20:16.777 --> 01:20:19.439
There's new evidence
to support that full...

01:20:19.513 --> 01:20:23.210
Functionality can be restored.
We need to run some tests.

01:20:23.283 --> 01:20:24.716
Who's we?

01:20:24.785 --> 01:20:26.776
Tell him your team is downstairs.

01:20:26.853 --> 01:20:30.118
My team is downstairs with
a signed order from Dr. Walsh.

01:20:30.190 --> 01:20:32.920
- You got it.
- This is the first I've heard of this.

01:20:32.993 --> 01:20:34.927
You won't mind
if I talk to Dr. Walsh?

01:20:34.995 --> 01:20:37.327
Go confirm with him.
We'll wait right here.

01:20:37.397 --> 01:20:39.160
I'll just get him on the phone.

01:20:42.035 --> 01:20:44.868
- David!
- OK, I'm not convincing as a doctor!

01:20:44.938 --> 01:20:47.668
Oh, God, David,
the felonies just keep pilin' up!

01:20:47.741 --> 01:20:49.606
- That way, David.
- Go this way.

01:20:50.811 --> 01:20:52.472
- Brett!
- What happened?

01:20:52.546 --> 01:20:53.911
Are you OK?

01:20:53.980 --> 01:20:56.972
This is Dr. Rushton.
I need security on the third floor.

01:20:57.050 --> 01:21:00.042
Don'tjostle. But go faster.

01:21:00.120 --> 01:21:03.146
- Take a right up here.
- Right here! Right, right, right!

01:21:06.593 --> 01:21:07.924
The elevator!

01:21:09.229 --> 01:21:11.220
Hold it! We need you to...

01:21:18.038 --> 01:21:19.767
Oh, shit.

01:21:21.174 --> 01:21:23.768
Stop right there!
Stop! Stop! Stop! Hold it!

01:21:23.844 --> 01:21:25.835
Come on! Hey, hey, hey!

01:21:27.781 --> 01:21:28.975
- David.
- Elizabeth.

01:21:29.049 --> 01:21:31.517
Oh, my God, David.
My breathing tube is gone.

01:21:31.585 --> 01:21:33.553
What? No!

01:21:33.620 --> 01:21:36.953
- Well, what can I do?
- It's too late. It's happening.

01:21:37.023 --> 01:21:38.888
- No.
- It's strong.

01:21:38.959 --> 01:21:40.187
Be stronger.

01:21:40.260 --> 01:21:41.852
It's pulling me away.

01:21:41.928 --> 01:21:43.361
No!

01:21:43.430 --> 01:21:44.897
Stay with me!

01:21:54.875 --> 01:21:57.139
- I got ya.
- Elizabeth!

01:21:57.210 --> 01:21:59.201
- No!
- David.

01:21:59.279 --> 01:22:01.076
- Give me a sedative!
- Help her!

01:22:01.148 --> 01:22:03.548
- Gimme five of Haldol.
- Help her! Elizabeth!

01:22:03.617 --> 01:22:06.051
- Hold him.
- No! Elizabeth!

01:22:16.163 --> 01:22:17.460
What's going on?

01:22:17.531 --> 01:22:19.465
- That's not possible.
- Yeah.

01:22:19.533 --> 01:22:21.524
That's not possible.

01:22:24.638 --> 01:22:28.096
Elizabeth? Can you hear me?

01:22:28.175 --> 01:22:31.338
I can't believe
we almost let you go.

01:22:31.411 --> 01:22:34.175
Honey? It's me, Abby.

01:22:34.247 --> 01:22:36.841
- Abby.
- Yeah.

01:22:41.988 --> 01:22:43.785
I think I bumped my head.

01:22:48.195 --> 01:22:49.662
It's OK.

01:23:01.541 --> 01:23:02.667
Hey.

01:23:04.010 --> 01:23:05.341
Hello.

01:23:06.813 --> 01:23:08.212
It's me.

01:23:08.281 --> 01:23:10.772
I'm sorry, I don't...

01:23:11.785 --> 01:23:15.186
Honey, it's David.
You don't remember David?

01:23:17.958 --> 01:23:19.357
The apartment.

01:23:20.494 --> 01:23:22.086
The rooftop.

01:23:22.162 --> 01:23:23.493
Garden.

01:23:25.232 --> 01:23:26.494
Nothin'.

01:23:40.247 --> 01:23:42.909
Honey, you don't
remember him at all?

01:24:48.548 --> 01:24:50.948
- Aunt Elizabeth, come on!
- Come on!

01:26:16.336 --> 01:26:18.566
We only rented it for a month.

01:26:18.638 --> 01:26:21.129
- Did you move something?
- No.

01:26:24.577 --> 01:26:27.045
It's funny, I just have
this strange feeling,

01:26:27.113 --> 01:26:29.479
like... something's missing.

01:26:29.549 --> 01:26:31.710
Everything's here, just as you left it.

01:26:34.287 --> 01:26:36.084
I guess it's just been a long time.

01:26:37.023 --> 01:26:38.581
You sure you're gonna be OK?

01:26:38.658 --> 01:26:40.091
Yeah. I'm gonna be good.

01:26:40.160 --> 01:26:43.687
- So I'll see you guys Saturday.
- OK. The girls'll bake for you.

01:28:10.984 --> 01:28:12.315
Hi.

01:28:16.790 --> 01:28:18.189
Don't worry, I'm...

01:28:19.526 --> 01:28:21.858
I just wanted you
to have your garden.

01:28:26.800 --> 01:28:28.233
How did you get up here?

01:28:29.736 --> 01:28:33.467
Spare key.
Under the fire extinguisher.

01:28:39.579 --> 01:28:42.207
Look, the last thing
I want to do is scare you.

01:28:44.184 --> 01:28:45.378
Goodbye, Lizzie.

01:28:50.156 --> 01:28:51.214
Wait.

01:28:54.460 --> 01:28:56.087
Yeah?

01:29:00.700 --> 01:29:02.691
The key. I need the key back.

01:29:02.769 --> 01:29:04.760
Oh, right.

01:29:13.580 --> 01:29:15.343
How do I know you?

01:29:16.182 --> 01:29:18.082
Maybe from your dreams.

01:29:25.391 --> 01:29:27.552
If you could ever really touch me,

01:29:27.627 --> 01:29:29.686
I might wake up from all of this.

01:29:31.931 --> 01:29:33.330
It wasn't a dream.

01:29:33.399 --> 01:29:34.923
No.
