01:00.687 --> 01:02.022
Okay, Cosmo.

01:02.272 --> 01:03.273
Shake.

01:03.732 --> 01:04.983
Good boy!

01:07.319 --> 01:08.570
See how easy it is?

01:09.529 --> 01:10.864
Tommy, shake.

01:12.324 --> 01:14.117
Good boy!

01:15.869 --> 01:17.955
Max, what are you up to?

01:18.038 --> 01:20.373
Training Tommy to do tricks.

01:22.334 --> 01:24.962
Why does his breath smell like Pup-Peroni?

01:27.631 --> 01:29.925
Because he wouldn't eat the Snausages.

01:34.220 --> 01:36.056
I got that. I got it.

01:38.767 --> 01:40.853
Look, I just started dating this guy.

01:41.061 --> 01:43.104
Everybody, just please act normal.

01:43.313 --> 01:46.441
But it's Hunter Pence.
He's my favorite San Francisco Giant.

01:46.525 --> 01:48.527
The man's won two World Series.

01:48.735 --> 01:50.403
Just don't embarrass me, okay?

01:55.575 --> 01:57.160
- Hi!
- Hi!

02:02.916 --> 02:04.751
Cheese!

02:06.378 --> 02:10.256
Hunter, I apologize.
This is my family not embarrassing me.

02:10.924 --> 02:13.886
I don't know what all the fuss is about.
I'm just a regular guy.

02:14.094 --> 02:16.555
I put on my uniform two legs at a time.

02:17.681 --> 02:19.432
Don't you mean one leg at a time?

02:19.641 --> 02:23.687
No. I stand on my bed
and jump right into them.

02:25.522 --> 02:27.983
It's a pleasure to meet you, Underpants.

02:29.735 --> 02:31.862
It's Hunter Pence.

02:32.071 --> 02:33.238
Really?

02:33.864 --> 02:35.448
That's disappointing.

02:36.533 --> 02:40.037
Well, sit. Sit, sit.
Oh, it's so nice to have you.

02:40.120 --> 02:42.748
You and Stephanie make the cutest couple.

02:42.956 --> 02:46.043
And Stephanie
is the nicest person I've ever met.

02:46.710 --> 02:47.753
How was that?

02:47.961 --> 02:50.589
Except where you asked me how it was,
it was great.

02:52.257 --> 02:56.177
It's so awesome your lifetime
batting average is .284.

02:56.386 --> 02:57.804
Right, Steph?

02:57.888 --> 02:58.972
Right.

02:59.765 --> 03:02.059
I'm delighted to meet all of you guys.

03:02.267 --> 03:05.437
And you kids, you're so lucky to have
Stephanie as your aunt.

03:06.980 --> 03:08.398
Did I get that right, Steph?

03:10.776 --> 03:13.236
Okay, look, I wanted this to go well.

03:13.904 --> 03:17.157
Hunter, I read online
that you eat pizza with a fork.

03:17.991 --> 03:19.993
Don't trust anything you read online,

03:20.660 --> 03:22.412
except for that!

03:23.371 --> 03:26.541
I've got my special pizza fork
right here at all times.

03:26.750 --> 03:28.251
Check that out.

03:28.460 --> 03:30.129
Isn't he the cutest?

03:30.336 --> 03:33.757
I just get lost
in those big old crazy eyes.

03:35.092 --> 03:36.969
I only have crazy eyes for you.

03:38.053 --> 03:39.096
Aw...

03:39.721 --> 03:43.058
Well, this is so nice of you
to invite us all to the game today.

03:43.142 --> 03:45.685
Oh, here are your tickets.

03:45.894 --> 03:50.273
You don't want to miss Stephanie singing
during the Seventh Inning Stretch.

03:50.356 --> 03:53.860
And thanks for hooking this up,
but it's a little terrifying.

03:54.069 --> 03:55.612
You said you want a singing career.

03:55.821 --> 04:00.117
I was thinking more an open mic night
at a deserted coffee house.

04:01.451 --> 04:05.164
Hey, you're singing "Take Me Out to
the Ball Game" to people at a ball game.

04:05.246 --> 04:06.999
It's the happiest moment in baseball.

04:08.041 --> 04:11.628
Except for when you take your cup off
after a doubleheader.

04:14.339 --> 04:15.757
Don't I know it.

04:17.466 --> 04:19.302
Mr. Hunter Pence, sir.

04:21.303 --> 04:22.848
I have show-and-tell on Monday.

04:22.931 --> 04:25.391
Could you please hit me a foul ball?

04:25.600 --> 04:28.561
I'm in a bit of a slump right now,
so I can't promise you anything.

04:28.645 --> 04:30.981
But I will give it my best shot.
How about that?

04:32.065 --> 04:32.899
Yeah.

04:34.193 --> 04:36.945
You know, I'm starting to think
your slump is my fault.

04:37.154 --> 04:40.240
- You haven't got a hit since we've dated.
- Oh, my gosh!

04:40.323 --> 04:42.325
You're the mystery blonde.

04:42.534 --> 04:45.453
You're the jinx.
Oh, it's all over the Internet.

04:45.662 --> 04:47.622
You're the jinx?

04:48.289 --> 04:49.415
Hey, guys.

04:49.624 --> 04:52.418
It's not Stephanie's fault.
I'm the one swinging the bat.

04:52.627 --> 04:55.881
Speaking of swinging the bat,
you're a tad late on the fastball.

04:56.089 --> 04:58.884
- And dropping your right elbow.
- You're swinging at garbage.

05:00.719 --> 05:03.889
- I'll let our batting coach know.
- You have a batting coach?

05:04.556 --> 05:05.932
Better fire that guy.

05:09.186 --> 05:12.105
- Alright, I'll see you later.
- Alright, see you later.

05:14.649 --> 05:17.610
Hunter Pence! Dude, you are the greatest.

05:17.819 --> 05:19.821
Man, finally, a real fan.

05:20.030 --> 05:23.158
Oh, my God. Oh, hey, man.
I played some Little League.

05:23.366 --> 05:25.994
From one All-Star to another,
choke up on that bat.

05:29.956 --> 05:32.625
I'll leave the tickets
at Will Call next time.

05:33.501 --> 05:35.378
I just came by to pick up my ticket.

05:35.587 --> 05:38.548
Yeah. Here you go, Matt.

05:38.631 --> 05:40.675
We will see you at the seats.

05:40.884 --> 05:44.179
Oh, sweet. Okay, great.
I will see all of you guys there.

05:44.387 --> 05:45.597
- Bye.
- Bye, Matt!

05:45.680 --> 05:48.808
Oh, I forgot, there's one more thing
I need to talk to you about.

05:59.861 --> 06:03.406
Wow! Well, I remembered that thing
that I need to talk to you about.

06:20.673 --> 06:25.304
Oh, we were... We were just talking
about animal clinic business stuff.

06:26.972 --> 06:28.765
Mom, you like him.

06:28.974 --> 06:30.809
Would it bother you boys if I did?

06:31.017 --> 06:32.644
- No. Matt's cool.
- I like him.

06:34.187 --> 06:36.522
I'm not your kid, but I like him, too.

06:38.441 --> 06:39.943
Tommy, what do you think?

06:40.152 --> 06:43.280
He's not a
three-time All-Star, but he's okay.

06:44.697 --> 06:50.662
Wow, I'm so glad that the kids are cool
with Matt. Because he is kind of great.

06:50.870 --> 06:54.540
Have you mentioned this to Steve?
He might not think Matt's so great.

06:55.917 --> 06:57.002
I know.

06:57.085 --> 06:59.671
I've been avoiding this for too long.

07:00.839 --> 07:04.050
I'm going to go tell Steve
that I'm interested in someone else.

07:04.259 --> 07:07.804
I mean, we haven't dated in 20 years.
It'll be fine.

07:09.639 --> 07:11.724
Can you guys tell him for me?

07:12.642 --> 07:16.771
I'll tell him.
Sorry, Steve. Mom likes another dude.

07:19.065 --> 07:21.067
So since Lola's coming
to the game with us,

07:21.151 --> 07:24.070
can you make me look good
by laughing when I say something funny?

07:24.279 --> 07:26.239
Sure, if that ever happens.

07:28.700 --> 07:30.952
Come on. This is important to me.

07:31.161 --> 07:34.539
Fine, I'll be your wing girl.
Just try to be cool.

07:34.747 --> 07:38.001
J-Money don't try. J-Money is.

07:40.379 --> 07:43.923
What? You told me to laugh
if you said something funny... J-Money.

07:46.634 --> 07:48.970
Aw, this was so fun.

07:49.054 --> 07:51.556
This is Cosmo's first walk
with his doggy mom.

07:51.764 --> 07:53.808
We should walk our dogs together
every morning.

07:53.892 --> 07:56.228
And every night.
Hey, let's just move in together.

07:58.397 --> 07:59.564
You know, for the dogs.

08:01.941 --> 08:03.860
Do you have a minute to chat?

08:04.069 --> 08:05.820
I gotta meet friends later, but sure.

08:06.029 --> 08:06.905
Sit.

08:09.074 --> 08:11.743
Good dogs. Good Steve.

08:15.205 --> 08:18.583
You know, I know we've been spending
a lot of time together lately.

08:18.666 --> 08:20.793
And it's been great. But I...

08:21.002 --> 08:23.422
Isn't it crazy
how fate has brought us back together?

08:23.629 --> 08:26.216
You hear about couples
who were each other's first loves

08:26.299 --> 08:28.968
and later in life,
they find their way back to each other.

08:31.554 --> 08:35.600
Ah, you're such a romantic.
That's one of the things I love about you.

08:35.808 --> 08:37.352
What are some other things?

08:38.686 --> 08:39.729
I could be late.

08:41.647 --> 08:43.357
I love that you always make me laugh.

08:44.609 --> 08:46.236
And I love that we're still friends.

08:46.445 --> 08:49.781
I gotta be honest, since we've been
hanging out again like this,

08:49.864 --> 08:52.284
all these old feelings are coming back.

08:52.492 --> 08:53.868
What about you?

08:54.702 --> 08:57.747
Well, of course I still care about you.

08:57.956 --> 08:59.665
I feel exactly the same way.

09:01.084 --> 09:05.088
Hey, Deej, I wonder
if we still have the old chemistry.

09:05.797 --> 09:08.716
- Oh, I don't know.
- Well, let's find out.

09:15.098 --> 09:17.100
That was our first kiss since high school.

09:19.060 --> 09:21.938
I feel like we're back
underneath the bleachers again.

09:23.773 --> 09:25.317
Oh, you were pretty fun.

09:25.525 --> 09:26.567
I'm a lot more fun now.

09:27.902 --> 09:31.406
I mean, that kiss... That was really nice.
But we could do a whole lot better.

09:32.491 --> 09:34.700
- Steve, I can't.
- Sure you can. Watch.

09:40.957 --> 09:42.208
Whoa.

09:44.503 --> 09:46.671
She is really letting him down easy.

09:48.840 --> 09:52.218
Yeah, he seems to be taking
the bad news pretty well.

09:55.763 --> 09:57.182
- Whoa.
- Wow.

09:58.141 --> 10:00.226
See, I told you we could do better.

10:01.686 --> 10:03.771
Well, um, I should get going.

10:03.980 --> 10:06.274
Yeah, I guess you should.

10:06.358 --> 10:09.986
Okay. But, um,
we will kiss about this later.

10:12.447 --> 10:14.115
Have you seen my dog?

10:14.949 --> 10:16.159
Comet?

10:21.747 --> 10:22.874
Here she comes.

10:38.181 --> 10:40.517
Kimmy, you realize
there's no coffee in that pot?

10:41.267 --> 10:43.769
Oh. Yeah, I'm cutting back on my caffeine.

10:45.938 --> 10:48.858
You guys saw our little kiss goodbye, huh?

10:48.941 --> 10:53.988
Well, we saw the G-rated peck and
then the R-rated full-frontal Frenching.

10:56.699 --> 11:00.953
Well, I was going to tell him about Matt.
And then he kissed me.

11:01.621 --> 11:02.955
And I liked it.

11:05.417 --> 11:08.253
But I just kissed Matt two hours ago.

11:09.588 --> 11:11.839
Oh, my gosh. Am I a floozy?

11:13.674 --> 11:17.262
Anyone who uses the word "floozy"
cannot be a floozy.

11:19.556 --> 11:22.183
Isn't Matt moving back to Miami
in, like, two weeks?

11:22.392 --> 11:27.188
You're right. I mean,
long-distance relationships never work.

11:28.147 --> 11:30.567
I should tell Matt
we should just be friends.

11:30.775 --> 11:34.446
Well, if it goes as well as it did
with Steve, he's a lucky man.

11:59.845 --> 12:00.930
Hey!

12:01.013 --> 12:04.643
Hey, Steph. Your boy Hunter really came
through with some great seats today.

12:04.850 --> 12:07.395
- He's such a doll.
- Pardon me. Excuse me.

12:07.479 --> 12:09.355
Pardon me. Help me, Steph.

12:09.439 --> 12:14.360
Ooh, boy, here we go.
Yes. Ooh, phew. Hi.

12:14.444 --> 12:17.780
Yeah, oh,
security frowns on personal advertising,

12:17.863 --> 12:22.201
but Gibbler Style Party Planning
doesn't play by the rules.

12:24.162 --> 12:26.539
The JumboTron's going to love my Fathead.

12:26.747 --> 12:28.166
Kimmy, I'm just curious.

12:28.249 --> 12:31.961
How many ideas did you go through before
deciding that this was the best one?

12:33.879 --> 12:36.007
Hey, Mom. Can I get something to eat?

12:36.090 --> 12:39.511
Oh, hey, no. You know what? I got
this ticket for free. This is my treat.

12:39.594 --> 12:40.845
Put it on my card.

12:40.928 --> 12:43.848
Aw, thanks, Matt.
Anybody want to get a bite with me?

12:44.056 --> 12:45.141
Oh, get me a hot dog.

12:45.224 --> 12:48.269
Mustard on the left, ketchup
on the right, relish down the middle.

12:48.353 --> 12:50.104
The mustard and ketchup can't touch.

12:50.313 --> 12:54.567
And my drink should be half root beer
and half diet soda, a splash of lemonade.

12:54.651 --> 12:56.402
I call it a Lola-Cola.

12:58.571 --> 13:00.239
Maybe you should just go with him.

13:00.323 --> 13:01.782
Works for me.

13:05.995 --> 13:10.709
<i>Now batting for the Giants,</i>
<i>right fielder, number eight, Hunter Pence.</i>

13:10.916 --> 13:12.835
Go, Pencey, go.

13:16.172 --> 13:21.219
Aw, he cleaned out his ear.
It's our secret signal.

13:21.302 --> 13:25.264
Oh, how romantic. A finger full of wax.

13:25.931 --> 13:29.310
I saw that ear thing.
You're that mystery blonde, ain't you?

13:29.394 --> 13:32.230
You're the jinx. Boo!

13:32.313 --> 13:33.773
Boo, Aunt Stephanie!

13:34.023 --> 13:35.775
Why are you booing me?

13:35.983 --> 13:38.528
I'm a Giant's fan. Hello.

13:42.823 --> 13:44.701
Aw, he struck out again.

13:44.909 --> 13:46.411
You'll get him next time, baby.

13:46.619 --> 13:50.623
Dump her, Hunter!
She's killing you, buddy!

13:54.835 --> 13:56.796
So, you want a hat or something?

13:56.879 --> 14:00.841
Oh, my gosh!

14:01.050 --> 14:06.556
It's an autographed two-time Cy Young
award-winning Tim Lincecum in-game jersey.

14:06.639 --> 14:08.725
He's my favorite pitcher
of the modern era.

14:08.808 --> 14:09.809
We'll take it.

14:11.102 --> 14:13.813
Really? Awesome!

14:14.021 --> 14:15.732
You didn't have to do that.

14:15.940 --> 14:17.817
But I'm kind of glad I did.

14:19.444 --> 14:22.363
- That will be $247.
- Whoa.

14:22.447 --> 14:25.617
No wonder my parents never bought me one.
Are you sure about this?

14:25.700 --> 14:29.078
Oh, yes, yes, yes. No problem.
Just put it on my card.

14:29.161 --> 14:30.455
Sure thing.

14:30.538 --> 14:31.831
Dr. Harmon?

14:32.039 --> 14:33.874
Dr. Matt Harmon.

14:35.293 --> 14:37.336
There's something
I really want to show you.

14:37.420 --> 14:39.756
It's my favorite place in the stadium.
Is that okay?

14:39.839 --> 14:41.132
Sure.

14:43.217 --> 14:44.427
That's how you do it.

14:49.307 --> 14:50.850
Ramona, Jackson just texted me.

14:50.933 --> 14:53.227
He and Lola are watching the game
from the top deck.

14:53.436 --> 14:55.104
Do they want me to come up?

14:55.187 --> 14:57.774
Um, it didn't say that.

14:58.441 --> 15:02.361
Well, I guess this is the thanks I get
for helping Jackson. They ditched me.

15:04.071 --> 15:06.907
Hey, you think you've got problems?

15:07.116 --> 15:10.119
Monday's show-and-tell
and I've got bupkis.

15:10.787 --> 15:13.038
Somebody hit me a foul ball.

15:14.624 --> 15:18.586
Hey, man, not over there.
I'm by first base!

15:21.922 --> 15:24.759
Hey, Deej, I have been meaning
to talk to you about something.

15:24.843 --> 15:27.219
About me moving back to Miami.

15:27.428 --> 15:30.640
Oh, I've been wanting
to talk to you about that, too.

15:30.723 --> 15:33.017
Long-distance relationships
are really hard.

15:33.225 --> 15:36.020
Yes, well, the truth is
that my family's here, right,

15:36.103 --> 15:40.024
and I love this city
and I love working at the clinic

15:40.107 --> 15:42.485
because there's this cute doctor
that works there.

15:42.694 --> 15:48.366
And so I have decided to move
to San Francisco permanently.

15:49.033 --> 15:50.284
This San Francisco?

15:50.493 --> 15:53.496
Oh, I thought you'd be
a little more excited than that.

15:53.705 --> 15:56.332
No, I am. It's wonderful.

15:56.415 --> 15:59.669
I just thought you were going to Steve.
I mean, leave.

16:00.753 --> 16:03.756
But now you're going to Steve... stay.

16:05.049 --> 16:08.678
<i>Now batting for the Giants,</i>
<i>number eight, Hunter Pence.</i>

16:08.887 --> 16:11.263
Hand me a foul ball. But not too hard.

16:11.472 --> 16:12.640
Max, honey,

16:12.724 --> 16:16.769
the odds of Hunter hitting a foul ball
directly to you are like a billion to one.

16:18.103 --> 16:19.814
He just hit one our way!

16:20.356 --> 16:22.066
- Oh!
- Oh, here it comes.

16:22.274 --> 16:26.654
- It's coming right at us!
- Yes, come to Daddy!

16:26.863 --> 16:28.698
Hey, man, that was my ball.

16:28.907 --> 16:30.282
Better get used to it now, kid,

16:30.366 --> 16:33.912
because life's a series of broken dreams
and bitter disappointments.

16:33.994 --> 16:37.081
Except today,
because I got myself a foul ball.

16:37.164 --> 16:38.791
- Hootie-hoo to you.
- Hey, buddy.

16:38.875 --> 16:41.126
He's just a kid, man.
Don't be a jerk, okay?

16:41.210 --> 16:43.379
Yeah, whatever, pal.

16:43.462 --> 16:46.591
Ooh, I just sat on my nachos.

16:46.799 --> 16:48.843
Yeah, that's what you get
for being a meanie.

16:48.927 --> 16:49.969
Snap.

16:52.847 --> 16:56.976
- He struck out again.
- Thanks to you, Jinxie.

16:57.184 --> 17:02.398
I'm about to go entertain the crowd, okay?
You enjoy sitting on your cheese.

17:03.482 --> 17:05.108
Come on, Ramona. Grab a fathead.

17:05.317 --> 17:07.569
Let's give these people
what they came here for.

17:07.653 --> 17:09.739
I think they came here to see a game.

17:09.948 --> 17:12.617
They came here for a good time.
That's what we'll give them.

17:12.825 --> 17:16.579
I have nothing else to do.
I've officially been friend-snatched.

17:20.290 --> 17:24.377
Wow, you were right. This view is amazing.

17:24.462 --> 17:26.547
Yeah. My dad used to bring me up here.

17:26.756 --> 17:29.842
You can see the city.
You can see the bay.

17:31.552 --> 17:35.890
I see my mom's car getting a parking
ticket. I told her that wasn't a space.

17:35.974 --> 17:37.391
It's windy.

17:38.559 --> 17:40.770
- Are you cold?
- A little.

17:40.853 --> 17:42.521
I'll keep you warm.

17:44.231 --> 17:45.566
- Can we take a selfie?
- No.

17:45.650 --> 17:47.192
I didn't think so.

17:48.319 --> 17:51.948
This is the perfect spot
for maximum Gibbler exposure.

17:54.283 --> 17:58.496
Alright. Are you ready?
Here we go. Five, six, seven, eight...

17:58.579 --> 18:00.456
Party planning, Gibbler Style!

18:00.665 --> 18:02.583
Always goes the extra mile!

18:02.792 --> 18:04.710
Is she really your best friend?

18:05.837 --> 18:09.590
- Party planning, Gibbler Style!
- Always leaves you with a smile!

18:10.591 --> 18:12.301
Here comes security.

18:12.510 --> 18:16.597
Dakota Fanning, Tatum
Channing, they all love my party planning!

18:16.681 --> 18:18.808
Hey, hey, hey,
careful with those fatheads.

18:18.891 --> 18:21.894
Go, go, Gibbler
for all your party planning needs.

18:21.978 --> 18:25.397
<i>The Giants remind fans</i>
<i>to please stay off the dugout.</i>

18:25.481 --> 18:28.233
Kimmy's getting hauled out of here.
Do you want to go help her?

18:28.317 --> 18:30.569
Oh, no.
This happens to Kimmy all the time.

18:30.653 --> 18:33.072
Oh, get your camera out.
Stephanie's about to sing.

18:33.280 --> 18:35.950
<i>Now it's time</i>
<i>for the Seventh Inning Stretch.</i>

18:36.034 --> 18:39.203
<i>So get on your feet
and show your San Francisco spirit</i>

18:39.286 --> 18:43.457
<i>by joining Stephanie Tanner in the singing
of "Take Me Out To the Ballgame."</i>

18:43.541 --> 18:45.084
<i>Take it away, Stephanie.</i>

18:46.961 --> 18:49.714
She's a jinx. Boo!

18:49.797 --> 18:53.676
We love you, Stephanie. Go Steph.

18:53.885 --> 18:55.011
Jinx, jinx!

18:55.219 --> 18:57.596
- This goes out to Hunter Pence...
- Jinx, jinx!

18:57.680 --> 19:01.059
You may never get a hit again,
but you're a hit in my heart.

19:06.355 --> 19:09.817

19:09.901 --> 19:12.820

19:13.696 --> 19:15.865
<i>♪ Buy me some peanuts and... ♪</i>

19:16.991 --> 19:21.328
What is wrong with you people?
What do you want from me?

19:21.412 --> 19:24.415
Wait, you want me to break up
with Hunter Pence?

19:29.045 --> 19:30.088
How rude!

19:32.548 --> 19:33.591
But do you know what?

19:34.550 --> 19:36.928
San Francisco is my city,

19:37.595 --> 19:40.180
so if that's what you people want,

19:40.264 --> 19:44.769
then for the love of the Giants, I will
break up with Hunter Pence right now.

19:46.645 --> 19:49.523
I'm sorry, Hunter. It's over.

19:51.275 --> 19:53.069
Stephanie's broken up with a lot of guys,

19:53.152 --> 19:55.404
but this is the first time
it'll be on SportsCenter.

20:00.785 --> 20:04.371
Oh, Hunter, I just want to look
in those crazy eyes one more time.

20:04.455 --> 20:05.456
Hunter!

20:05.664 --> 20:07.625
Hunter! Hunter! Hunter, no!

20:07.833 --> 20:09.418
Hunter, wait!

20:09.501 --> 20:10.795
Hunter!

20:10.878 --> 20:11.754
Wait!

20:11.921 --> 20:13.881
Well, maybe I'll get a hit now.

20:15.091 --> 20:19.428
<i>The Giants extend their</i>
<i>apologies. Now, let's enjoy the Kiss Cam.</i>

20:27.853 --> 20:28.980
Hey, there's my girl!

20:33.567 --> 20:35.235
She's such a good mom, you guys.

20:46.371 --> 20:50.626
Whoa, guys, leave her alone.
She's being polite. Good job, honey.

20:56.132 --> 20:57.675
Kiss him, Mom.

20:59.177 --> 21:00.094
Don't do it, D.J.

21:06.642 --> 21:09.478
What? No... D.J.!

21:09.561 --> 21:11.689
Excuse me, sorry. I'm so sorry. Excuse me.

21:11.897 --> 21:14.817
D.J., a word.
Out of my way, Lou Seal.

21:15.026 --> 21:19.404
This doesn't concern you, Lou. Whoa.
This isn't your business, Lou Seal.

21:19.613 --> 21:22.533
Isn't that your podiatrist,
wrestling a seal?

21:23.575 --> 21:25.619
Oh, my lanta!

21:25.703 --> 21:27.371
What is Steve doing here?

21:28.122 --> 21:31.333
- D.J., I need a word with you, please.
- Sir, let's go.

21:31.542 --> 21:33.085
What's he so upset about?

21:34.170 --> 21:35.337
I don't know.

21:35.546 --> 21:37.882
We were just kissing this morning!

21:38.090 --> 21:40.551
Did he say you two were kissing
this morning?

21:41.260 --> 21:44.763
I don't know, I can't hear.
Let's go, Giants.

21:45.681 --> 21:47.641
Let's go, Giants.

21:48.350 --> 21:50.936
<i>Now batting for the Giants, number eight.</i>

21:51.145 --> 21:52.188
Look, here they come.

21:58.069 --> 22:01.197
Well, what a fun way
to launch my singing career...

22:01.280 --> 22:03.657
An emotional breakdown
in front of 40,000 people.

22:04.783 --> 22:07.369
Not only did I make it
on the JumboTron, but guess what?

22:07.452 --> 22:10.748
Channel Six caught it all, and I'll be
on the eleven o'clock news tonight.

22:10.831 --> 22:12.166
I lead a charmed life.

22:20.382 --> 22:21.425
Do we have to leave?

22:21.633 --> 22:23.219
I didn't catch my foul ball.

22:23.427 --> 22:26.847
Yeah. It's the bottom of the ninth.
Bases are loaded.

22:26.931 --> 22:28.182
Giants are down by three.

22:28.390 --> 22:32.103
- Hunter Pence is up to bat.
- Hit me a home run, Pencey!

22:32.186 --> 22:36.648
Max, the odds of him hitting a home run
directly to you are like a billion to one.

22:38.525 --> 22:41.195
- He hit a long drive to right field.
- This is right field.

22:41.403 --> 22:43.239
It's going, going... gone!

22:44.949 --> 22:47.492
It's not gone, it's right here.

22:47.701 --> 22:49.078
Whoo-hoo!

22:49.287 --> 22:50.955
Okay, let's go home.

22:55.626 --> 22:58.254
Come on, everybody.
Let's see if we're on SportsCenter.

23:00.756 --> 23:04.426
Hey, Max, you're going to have
a great story for show-and-tell on Monday.

23:04.635 --> 23:09.223
Yeah, my home run ball is so much cooler
than Taylor's sea monkeys.

23:09.307 --> 23:11.976
And they aren't even monkeys.
They're just shrimp.

23:14.186 --> 23:15.229
Kids are so gullible.

23:17.940 --> 23:21.819
Are you sure we're cool? I feel really bad
about breaking the girl code.

23:21.902 --> 23:23.821
Sisters before misters.

23:25.281 --> 23:28.033
Well, if you feel really bad,
then I feel better.

23:29.243 --> 23:32.163
It was all my fault.
I invited her out to my favorite seats.

23:32.246 --> 23:34.414
I mean, I never expected her to say yes.

23:35.207 --> 23:38.043
Are you sure I can't help you
pay for this jersey?

23:38.252 --> 23:40.671
Nah, it's okay.
I worked out a deal with Dr. Matt.

23:40.754 --> 23:44.883
I'm washing his car this weekend.
And every weekend for the next two years.

23:46.510 --> 23:47.886
What are you doing?

23:47.970 --> 23:51.849
Well, I'm expecting a little fallout
from my unexpected double-date.

23:52.057 --> 23:54.101
I'm changing my email,
shutting down Facebook

23:54.185 --> 23:56.103
and pricing a four-bedroom house in Idaho.

23:58.563 --> 24:01.942
I'll get that. Might be one of the guys
you kissed in the last eight hours.

24:04.611 --> 24:05.737
Hey, it is.

24:07.781 --> 24:10.326
D.J., we need to have a little chat.

24:11.660 --> 24:12.953
I get to answer this one.

24:16.415 --> 24:18.000
- Hi, Matt.
- Hi.

24:19.751 --> 24:21.628
D.J., the other guy you kissed is here.

24:23.214 --> 24:26.884
D.J., you said we could talk
about things later. Well... it's later.

24:27.634 --> 24:31.055
Wow, this is the second time today

24:31.263 --> 24:34.516
you guys are in the same place
at the same time.

24:35.767 --> 24:36.768
Isn't that funny?

24:38.896 --> 24:43.150
Okay, why don't we all just sit down on
the couch and we can talk about our day.

24:46.862 --> 24:49.448
Excuse me, sorry.
Scoot over, Steve. Okay.

24:50.282 --> 24:51.116
Sorry.

24:53.577 --> 24:55.829
Oh, did you not need us here for this?

24:56.038 --> 24:57.956
- No.
- Okay.

24:58.999 --> 25:01.460
We'll be in the kitchen
pretending not to listen.

25:03.712 --> 25:07.174
The truth is, well,
Matt and I just started dating.

25:07.383 --> 25:10.510
And, Steve, I was going to tell you,
but then you kissed me.

25:10.719 --> 25:13.431
And then I was going to tell Matt
that I kissed Steve.

25:13.513 --> 25:17.435
But then, Matt, you kissed me.
And, well, Steve, you saw.

25:17.517 --> 25:22.689
So... So as you can see,
I am completely innocent in all of this.

25:23.982 --> 25:26.026
Okay, thanks for stopping by.

25:26.693 --> 25:31.323
Wait, D.J., I have, like,
real feelings for you.

25:31.407 --> 25:34.034
Uh, and I have realer feelings for you.

25:35.577 --> 25:37.579
The past six weeks have been great.

25:37.788 --> 25:40.416
Oh, six weeks? We go back 25 years.

25:42.501 --> 25:44.462
Checkmate. Your move.

25:45.754 --> 25:47.547
Man, there is no move after checkmate.

25:47.756 --> 25:49.049
That was my point exactly.

25:50.175 --> 25:53.053
Guys, you are both great.

25:53.137 --> 25:57.641
But it was just a week ago that I decided
I was ready to go on my first date.

25:57.849 --> 26:01.186
My first date in 15 years.

26:01.979 --> 26:05.399
And now I have two amazing men
that want to date me,

26:06.150 --> 26:09.569
and I like them both and I am so confused.

26:09.778 --> 26:13.073
How can you be confused
after the kiss that we had?

26:13.282 --> 26:17.702
Oh, please. That crowd-induced
JumboTron pity kiss? Come on.

26:20.289 --> 26:23.083
No. I'm talking about our first kiss.

26:25.627 --> 26:26.670
I'll see you Monday.

26:27.421 --> 26:29.631
Okay, Monday it is.

26:33.177 --> 26:34.303
D.J., wait.

26:38.015 --> 26:40.600
- Oh!
- Oh, now that's a kiss.

26:40.684 --> 26:42.978
D.J.! How could you do this to me?

26:43.061 --> 26:45.397
I wasn't doing it to you.

26:49.527 --> 26:53.071
Oh, that was nothing. Alright, you want
to see some real romance? Watch this.

26:54.823 --> 26:55.866
I love you.

26:58.243 --> 26:59.286
I love you, too.

27:04.542 --> 27:06.001
Oh, we were in love.

27:06.084 --> 27:07.252
You were in high school.

27:08.753 --> 27:10.964
Wow, Steve. Your hair was great.

27:11.965 --> 27:13.384
Our kids would have that hair.

27:13.467 --> 27:14.510
Not for long.

27:16.178 --> 27:17.762
What are you two doing here?

27:17.846 --> 27:19.598
Sorry, we'll go back in the kitchen.

27:23.643 --> 27:24.895
D.J., what do you want to do?

27:25.812 --> 27:29.816
Please don't put any pressure on me.
I'm not ready to make any big decisions.

27:30.025 --> 27:32.570
I'm not interested in being
in some kind of competition.

27:34.946 --> 27:38.200
I agree. I'm out.

27:49.961 --> 27:51.963
Okay, if he's out, I'm totally back in.

27:53.715 --> 27:57.677
Then I'm back in, too.
Can we have dinner next week?

27:57.886 --> 28:00.264
Um, yeah, sure.

28:01.098 --> 28:02.224
Can we go out, too?

28:03.225 --> 28:04.518
Yeah, I guess so.

28:04.602 --> 28:06.686
Okay, great. Great, so I'll see you soon.

28:06.770 --> 28:07.938
And I'll see you sooner.

28:18.407 --> 28:20.867
Do you see my problem?
You're both great kissers.

28:23.203 --> 28:25.664
I was not impressed. Not impressed at all.

28:27.374 --> 28:28.708
I wasn't even trying.

28:35.840 --> 28:39.261
D.J. Fuller, dating two guys at once.

28:39.470 --> 28:41.430
