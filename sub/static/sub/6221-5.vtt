DRAGON: /In a land of myth
and a time of magic,

00:05.339 --> 00:10.011
the destiny of a great kingdom
rests on the shoulders of a young boy.

00:10.511 --> 00:13.181
His name, Merlin.

00:29.447 --> 00:31.449
(HIGH PITCHED SHRIEKING)

00:49.884 --> 00:51.385
(MAN YELLING)

00:53.095 --> 00:54.472
(GRUNTING)

01:05.107 --> 01:06.442
Run! Run!

01:31.342 --> 01:32.677
It's gone.

01:33.135 --> 01:34.679
(BOTH PANTING)

01:36.430 --> 01:37.515
You saved my life.

01:39.308 --> 01:40.351
I'm Merlin.

01:41.644 --> 01:42.979
Lancelot.

01:46.983 --> 01:48.359
(GROANING)

02:23.477 --> 02:24.854
(GROANING)

02:27.898 --> 02:31.402
The wound itself is superficial.
The fever will pass.

02:31.861 --> 02:33.988
He should be fine by the morning.

02:34.071 --> 02:35.740
(INHALES DEEPLY)

02:40.536 --> 02:42.663
What creature
could have done this?

02:42.747 --> 02:46.751
We found no tracks in or out.
What the villagers say must be true.

02:47.168 --> 02:49.670
It has wings. And...

02:51.047 --> 02:52.590
What?

02:52.757 --> 02:55.426
And it took no livestock.
Only people.

02:57.094 --> 02:59.722
Whatever it is,
it has a taste for human flesh.

03:01.057 --> 03:03.768
Post sentries in all
the outlying villages.

03:03.851 --> 03:06.020
Put the lookouts on full alert.

03:06.103 --> 03:09.023
If this thing should make for Camelot,
we must be ready.

03:12.234 --> 03:16.280
LANCELOT: Ever since I was a child,
I've dreamed of coming here.

03:16.530 --> 03:20.117
It's my life's ambition
to join the Knights of Camelot.

03:21.619 --> 03:25.706
| know what you're thinking.
| expect too much.

03:26.457 --> 03:28.292
After all, who am I?

03:28.376 --> 03:31.295
They have their pick of
the best and bravest in the land...

03:31.462 --> 03:33.047
-Lancelot.
-Yes?

03:34.131 --> 03:35.299
They're going to love you.

03:36.217 --> 03:37.551
They are?

03:37.968 --> 03:39.053
(LAUGHS)
I've seen you in action.

03:39.136 --> 03:41.138
You could shame
the great Arthur himself.

03:41.222 --> 03:43.307
(SCOFFS) I hardly think so.

03:43.391 --> 03:45.142
In fact, you know
what I'm going to do?

03:45.935 --> 03:47.728
I'm going to talk to him right now.

03:47.812 --> 03:49.230
You know Arthur?

03:50.314 --> 03:51.607
Oh, yes.

03:52.316 --> 03:55.820
Right you jumped-up
dung beetle, this is it.

03:56.779 --> 03:58.656
Your final test.

03:58.739 --> 04:01.242
Pass this and
you're a knight of Camelot.

04:02.493 --> 04:04.495
Fail and you're no one.

04:05.121 --> 04:08.958
You face the most feared of all foes,
the ultimate killing machine.

04:11.669 --> 04:13.170
You face me.

04:13.295 --> 04:16.589
Your challenge is
to last one minute in free combat.

04:18.007 --> 04:20.136
Grimond, second son of Wessex,

04:25.349 --> 04:26.767
your time starts now.

04:32.106 --> 04:33.357
(YELLS)

04:35.192 --> 04:36.277
ALL: Oh!

04:36.861 --> 04:38.529
(ALL APPLAUDING)

04:44.285 --> 04:45.828
Take him away.

04:46.871 --> 04:49.039
Grimond's the third to fail this month.

04:49.123 --> 04:52.126
How am I meant to defend Camelot
with rubbish like that?

04:52.460 --> 04:54.378
| think I might be able to help.

04:54.462 --> 04:55.546
You, Merlin?

04:55.713 --> 04:58.048
You haven't the faintest idea
what it takes to be a knight.

04:58.132 --> 05:01.051
Courage, fortitude, discipline.

05:01.385 --> 05:05.222
No, no, of course I don't.
But I do know someone who does.

05:05.306 --> 05:07.224
-Yeah?
-He saved my life.

05:07.349 --> 05:09.310
(SCOFFS) That's blown it for starters.

05:09.393 --> 05:11.145
No, no, no.
He's really good. Honestly.

05:11.228 --> 05:12.897
That's great, Merlin,
I'm sure he's terrific

05:12.980 --> 05:14.398
but you forget
the first code of Camelot.

05:14.523 --> 05:16.275
-The what?
-The first code.

05:16.358 --> 05:19.069
Only those of noble blood
can serve as knights.

05:19.153 --> 05:21.530
So unless your
friend is a nobleman...

05:21.655 --> 05:23.574
(STAMMERING) He is a nobleman.

05:24.241 --> 05:25.576
-Is he?
-Absolutely.

05:26.410 --> 05:27.661
Very well.

05:27.745 --> 05:29.830
Bring him to
the training ground tomorrow.

05:29.914 --> 05:32.082
And make sure he brings
his seal of nobility.

05:32.249 --> 05:34.919
Thanks, Arthur.
You won't regret it.

05:37.755 --> 05:39.423
Well? Did you speak to him?

05:39.548 --> 05:41.091
-Yeah, I spoke to him.
-And?

05:42.092 --> 05:43.344
And...

05:46.680 --> 05:47.932
He said he would like to meet you.

05:48.015 --> 05:49.099
Yes!

05:49.934 --> 05:51.685
Thank you, thank you.

05:51.769 --> 05:54.355
No problem.
Really. It was nothing.

05:54.772 --> 05:55.940
(CLEARS THROAT)

05:56.023 --> 05:57.691
You're not a nobleman,
by any chance, are you?

05:57.775 --> 06:02.029
A nobleman? No.
Good Lord, no. Why do you ask?

06:02.571 --> 06:04.198
It's just that...

06:04.281 --> 06:05.616
The first code of Camelot states

06:05.699 --> 06:08.577
that only those of noble blood
can serve as a knight.

06:10.120 --> 06:11.789
Uther created the knights

06:11.872 --> 06:14.542
to protect this kingdom
from those who wished to destroy it.

06:15.209 --> 06:18.796
He knew he would have to trust
each of his knights with his life.

06:18.879 --> 06:22.216
So he chose them from the families
that had sworn allegiance to him.

06:22.299 --> 06:23.551
The nobility.

06:23.634 --> 06:25.511
And thus,
the first code of Camelot was born.

06:25.594 --> 06:27.555
And ever since that day,

06:27.638 --> 06:31.100
only the sons of noble
families have served as knights.

06:32.560 --> 06:34.562
That is not fair!

06:34.645 --> 06:37.398
Fair or unfair,
that's the way it is.

06:38.440 --> 06:41.986
I'm sorry, Lancelot.
Truly, I am.

06:57.501 --> 06:59.295
Why do you want to be
a knight so much?

07:00.588 --> 07:02.298
When I was a boy,

07:03.757 --> 07:07.678
my village was attacked
by raiders from the northern plains.

07:09.054 --> 07:11.765
They were slaughtered where they stood.

07:11.849 --> 07:13.976
My father, my mother, everyone.

07:15.519 --> 07:16.854
| alone escaped.

07:19.064 --> 07:21.191
| vowed that day that never again

07:21.275 --> 07:23.944
would I be helpless
in the face of tyranny.

07:24.194 --> 07:26.363
| made sword craft my life.

07:26.614 --> 07:30.909
Every waking hour since that day
| devoted to the art of combat.

07:32.286 --> 07:36.248
And when I was ready,
| set forth for Camelot.

07:39.001 --> 07:41.503
And now it seems my journey ends.

07:42.546 --> 07:45.424
Everything I fought for, wasted.

07:46.634 --> 07:48.427
| give you my word.

07:48.552 --> 07:51.639
Whatever it takes,
I'll make this right.

08:07.488 --> 08:08.822

09:12.636 --> 09:14.346
(CLEARING THROAT)

09:18.892 --> 09:20.936
It's a real page-turner.

09:28.777 --> 09:29.820
What's that?

09:29.903 --> 09:31.905
This is your seal of nobility.

09:31.989 --> 09:33.157
| don't understand.

09:33.240 --> 09:35.159
Ladies and gentleman,
| give you,

09:35.242 --> 09:37.995

fifth son of Lord Eldred of Northumbria.

09:38.245 --> 09:39.538
No, Merlin, no.

09:39.621 --> 09:41.623
All right.
So, you don't want to be a knight, then?

09:41.832 --> 09:42.875
Of course I do!

09:42.958 --> 09:44.042
But what?

09:44.126 --> 09:46.044
The rules don't allow it?
Damn the rules.

09:46.128 --> 09:47.880
-The rules are wrong.
-But it's a lie.

09:47.963 --> 09:49.673
It's against everything
the knights stand for.

09:49.757 --> 09:53.677
You have as much right to be a knight
as any man. I know it.

09:54.136 --> 09:55.554
But the rules, Merlin...

09:55.637 --> 09:58.432
We're not breaking the rules.
We're bending them, that's all.

09:58.515 --> 10:01.268
You get your foot in the door.
But after that,

10:01.477 --> 10:04.229
you will be judged on your merit alone.

10:04.730 --> 10:07.858
And if you succeed,
if they make you a knight,

10:08.400 --> 10:11.737
it'll be because you have earned it.
Noble or not.

10:14.198 --> 10:16.992
| can't change the way
things are done around here.

10:17.201 --> 10:18.660
But you can.

10:19.787 --> 10:21.789
If you let me help you.

10:28.253 --> 10:31.548

This is very kind of you, uh...

-Gwen.
-Gwen.

-Short for Guinevere.
-Ah.

10:37.346 --> 10:39.473
Then thank you, Guinevere.

10:40.349 --> 10:43.185
Don't thank me,
thank Merlin.

10:43.352 --> 10:45.771
Merlin would do anything for anyone,
wouldn't you, Merlin?

10:46.146 --> 10:49.775
Sorry. Can you raise your arms?
Sorry.

10:54.446 --> 10:57.366
| think it's great
that Merlin's got you this chance.

10:57.449 --> 10:59.326
We need men like you.

10:59.701 --> 11:00.953
You do?

11:02.371 --> 11:04.998
Well, not me personally.
But, you know, Camelot.

11:05.791 --> 11:09.044
Camelot needs knights.
Not just Arthur and his kind,

11:09.127 --> 11:10.838
but ordinary people
like you and me.

11:11.588 --> 11:13.215
Well, I'm not a knight yet, my lady.

11:13.507 --> 11:15.759
And I'm not a lady. (LAUGHS)

11:15.843 --> 11:17.261
Sorry. I...

11:18.595 --> 11:21.932
Okay, we're done. Um, I should
have these ready in no time.

11:22.015 --> 11:24.434
It's nice to meet you, Lancelot.

11:36.738 --> 11:38.991
She seems lovely, Guinevere.

11:39.074 --> 11:40.784
Oh, yeah, she is.

11:41.410 --> 11:44.329
And the best seamstress
in Camelot, I promise.

-Doesn't he just?
-I don't feel it.

Okay, that'll do for today.
Well done.

Go for it.

-What have you done, Merlin?
-Okay.

14:00.924 --> 14:02.801
| bent the rules a little.
But the rules are wrong.

14:02.968 --> 14:06.430
-They're unfair.
-You bent the rules using magic?

14:06.596 --> 14:10.434
It was nothing. Honestly.
More of a trick than actual magic.

14:10.684 --> 14:12.269
Your magic is not a toy, Merlin.

14:12.352 --> 14:14.980
It is not for you to use
or abuse as you see fit.

14:15.063 --> 14:17.232
- I know, I know.
-Then why did you do it?

14:17.315 --> 14:18.984
| owe Lancelot my life.

14:19.067 --> 14:21.445
I'm paying for that debt
the only way I can

14:21.528 --> 14:24.114
by giving him
the opportunity he deserves.

14:24.197 --> 14:26.616
If you want to punish me for it,
go ahead.

14:43.467 --> 14:44.760
Not bad.

14:46.470 --> 14:48.722
Would you like me
to sweep the guardhouse again, sire?

14:48.805 --> 14:51.058
It certainly needs sweeping.

14:52.184 --> 14:55.228
First,
I'd like you to kill me.

Come on.
Don't pretend you don't want to.

You don't have to track it.

16:57.058 --> 16:59.644
Have faith, Father.
We'll be ready.

17:07.527 --> 17:12.824
The wings of an eagle,
and the body of a lion.

17:16.828 --> 17:23.460
The wings of an eagle,
and the body of a lion.

17:28.339 --> 17:30.759
ARTHUR:
The beast is heading for Camelot.

17:30.842 --> 17:35.513
It's fast and agile,
but big enough to hit and to hit hard.

17:36.765 --> 17:39.392
Starting today,
your training routines

17:39.476 --> 17:41.645
will concentrate on an attack strategy.

17:42.729 --> 17:46.191
We don't have much time.
Dismissed.

17:49.945 --> 17:51.363
Yes, Lancelot.

17:51.446 --> 17:54.449
Is there anything I can do, sire?
It's just...

17:54.532 --> 17:57.202
| know that in the event of battle
only a knight may serve.

17:57.285 --> 18:00.914
That's correct, Lancelot.
And you are not yet a knight.

18:01.831 --> 18:04.042
Which is why I'm bringing
your test forward.

18:04.125 --> 18:06.461
You'll face me in the morning.

18:12.008 --> 18:16.846
Well, here we are.
Your final challenge.

18:19.182 --> 18:22.227
Succeed, and you join the elite.

18:23.812 --> 18:26.731
Fail, and your journey ends here.

18:28.817 --> 18:33.571
Lancelot,
fifth son of Lord Eldred of Northumbiria,

18:38.201 --> 18:39.703
your time starts now.

18:56.928 --> 18:58.513

19:51.608 --> 19:52.650
On your knees.

20:03.953 --> 20:09.250
Arise, Sir Lancelot,
Knight of Camelot.

20:09.626 --> 20:11.294
(ALL APPLAUDING)

20:17.175 --> 20:20.011
Who is this man?
He seems to have come out of nowhere.

20:20.720 --> 20:24.516
| know. He's been a bit
of a surprise to all of us.

20:24.849 --> 20:27.477
You do us a great honor,
Sir Lancelot.

20:27.685 --> 20:30.605
The knighthood
is the very foundation of Camelot.

20:30.688 --> 20:32.941
The honor is all mine, sire.

20:33.024 --> 20:34.943
Your father will be very proud.

20:35.026 --> 20:36.236
Yes, sire.

20:36.319 --> 20:39.322
| have not seen Lord Eldred
for many years.

20:39.823 --> 20:41.658
Longer than I had imagined,
it seems.

20:42.325 --> 20:45.328
Last time I saw him,
he only had four sons.

20:47.414 --> 20:48.581
Well,

20:50.542 --> 20:51.626
here I am.

20:51.709 --> 20:55.588
Indeed you are.
And I've kept you too long already.

20:56.047 --> 20:57.841
Enjoy the celebrations.

20:57.924 --> 20:59.092
Sire.

21:03.513 --> 21:08.268
Take this seal to Geoffrey of Monmouth,
the court genealogist.

21:09.269 --> 21:11.604
| want his opinion by morning.

21:17.277 --> 21:22.198
Look at him, Gaius.
Does Lancelot not deserve this moment?

21:22.615 --> 21:24.617
| never said he didn't.

21:24.784 --> 21:28.037
But destiny and desserts
are not the same thing.

21:28.204 --> 21:30.123
You played God, Merlin.

21:30.206 --> 21:32.542
You set him on
a path of your choosing.

21:32.625 --> 21:36.212
Tonight, you brought him triumph,
but who knows what the future may hold.

21:36.880 --> 21:39.007
Yeah, I don't know what it
said on your invitation,

21:39.090 --> 21:42.385
but on mine,
it said, "Celebration?"

21:42.552 --> 21:43.803
(LAUGHS)

21:43.970 --> 21:46.890
Point taken.
Don't come back too late.

21:46.973 --> 21:48.224
All right.

22:04.073 --> 22:05.283
Here's trouble.

22:06.326 --> 22:11.247
Tell me,
do you think her beautiful?

22:13.416 --> 22:16.002
Yes, sire, I do.

22:17.170 --> 22:20.340
Yeah, I suppose she is.

22:23.760 --> 22:25.261
You know what?

22:26.012 --> 22:28.306

might have eyes for you, Gwen.

22:28.598 --> 22:30.141
(LAUGHS) Don't be silly.

22:30.266 --> 22:32.393
So what if he did?
Would that really be so bad?

22:32.477 --> 22:34.312
-He's not really my type.
-Oh.

22:34.437 --> 22:36.064
There's a surprise.

22:36.147 --> 22:39.108
Sometimes, Guinevere,
| wonder if you'd know

22:39.192 --> 22:42.570
what your type was
if he was standing right next to you.

22:42.654 --> 22:44.822
-You're probably right.
-Oh.

22:45.114 --> 22:46.449
Thank you.

22:50.620 --> 22:54.791
So, come on. Just for
the sake of argument. If you had to,

22:55.458 --> 22:57.252
Arthur or Lancelot?

22:57.335 --> 22:59.003
But I don't have to
and I never will.

(LAUGHING)

23:57.061 --> 23:58.187
(DOOR OPENING)

23:59.063 --> 24:00.398
MERLIN: What are you doing?

24:00.523 --> 24:02.025
King's orders.

24:03.943 --> 24:05.111
Stop!

24:10.533 --> 24:11.743
UTHER:
Tell him what you told me.

24:12.869 --> 24:14.412
These credentials are faked.

24:15.121 --> 24:18.791
The seal itself is faultless, forgery
of the highest possible standard.

24:18.875 --> 24:20.543
But a forgery, it must be.

24:21.044 --> 24:25.256
There is no record of a fifth son
of Lord Eldred of Northumbria.

24:26.883 --> 24:28.009
Therefore he...

24:28.092 --> 24:31.387
Lied. Do you deny it?

24:33.222 --> 24:34.557
No, sire.

24:36.559 --> 24:39.479
You have broken
the first code of Camelot.

24:40.313 --> 24:43.608
You have brought shame
upon yourself and upon us.

24:44.150 --> 24:46.736
You are not worthy
of the knighthood bestowed upon you.

24:47.403 --> 24:51.115
You never were.
And you never will be.

24:52.825 --> 24:54.911
Get him out of my sight.

25:00.291 --> 25:01.584
Sire...

25:01.751 --> 25:03.920
Do you contest my judgment?

25:04.420 --> 25:06.756
His deception was inexcusable.

25:08.257 --> 25:10.843
But he meant no harm, sire.
| am sure of it.

25:10.927 --> 25:12.970
He only wished to serve.

25:14.681 --> 25:17.308
The first code is
a sacred bond of trust.

25:17.433 --> 25:19.769
It is what binds the knights together.

25:21.312 --> 25:23.106
How can you trust
a man who's lied to you?

25:38.287 --> 25:39.914
| don't know what to
say to you, Lancelot.

25:39.997 --> 25:42.458
-You're not to blame.
-Yes, I am.

| pushed you.
| made you lie.

25:45.795 --> 25:47.630
The choice was mine.

25:47.964 --> 25:51.467
My punishment is mine to bear
and mine to bear alone.

-Whatever you do,

26:00.810 --> 26:02.270

in the wrong place,

26:16.075 --> 26:18.995

living things in the kingdom.

26:19.078 --> 26:20.329

26:20.413 --> 26:24.041
what about creatures
only recorded in legend, in myth?

26:24.709 --> 26:26.627
And I discovered this.

Let's not wait for it.

29:43.240 --> 29:44.825
GAIUS: Sire, if I may?

29:44.909 --> 29:45.993
Gaius?

29:46.077 --> 29:50.081
I've been researching this creature,
sire. I believe it to be a griffin.

29:50.539 --> 29:53.125
A griffin?
What's in a name?

29:53.292 --> 29:55.127
The griffin is a creature of magic.

29:56.879 --> 29:58.673
| don't have time
for this, physician...

29:58.756 --> 30:03.010
It is born of magic, sire.
And it can only be killed by magic.

30:03.094 --> 30:05.137
You are mistaken.

30:05.221 --> 30:07.556
It is a creature of flesh and blood
like any other.

30:07.890 --> 30:09.266
Arthur proved that today.

30:09.392 --> 30:10.977
I'm not so sure, Father.

30:11.060 --> 30:12.979
| think there may be
some truth in what he says.

30:13.062 --> 30:14.313
What truth?

30:14.397 --> 30:15.648
The griffin was unharmed, sire.

30:15.731 --> 30:17.149
Our weapons seemed useless against him.

30:17.316 --> 30:19.735
Useless? I think not.

30:21.278 --> 30:23.656
No. It has tasted our steel once.

30:23.739 --> 30:26.117
The next time will be its last.

30:26.951 --> 30:28.828
When will your knights
be ready to ride again?

30:29.495 --> 30:31.080
An hour, maybe two.

30:31.580 --> 30:33.749
Good. We finish this tonight.

30:49.015 --> 30:53.144
Is it true?
The griffin can only be killed by magic?

30:53.269 --> 30:55.604
Yes, Merlin.
I'm certain of it.

30:55.688 --> 30:57.815
If Arthur rides out against it,
he'll die.

30:57.940 --> 31:01.444
Then he must be stopped.
Uther must see reason.

31:01.861 --> 31:05.448
Where magic is concerned,
our King is blind to reason.

31:08.325 --> 31:12.455
And yet, magic is our only hope.

31:14.123 --> 31:15.207
You're not suggesting...

31:17.626 --> 31:19.170
It is your destiny, Merlin.

31:20.004 --> 31:22.381
The true purpose of your magic.

31:23.132 --> 31:25.968
You saw it, Gaius.
| can't go up against that thing.

31:26.052 --> 31:29.722
But if you do not,
then Arthur will surely perish.

31:30.806 --> 31:33.142
No, no. This is madness.

31:34.185 --> 31:36.645
| don't have magic that powerful.
There must be another way.

31:36.729 --> 31:38.105
This is the only way.

You don't sound like a knight.
You don't even look like a knight.

-I'm sorry.
-I'm sorry, too.

32:43.129 --> 32:45.256

| have never faced its like.

33:02.064 --> 33:04.942
| faced it myself, sire.
Some days past.

33:05.359 --> 33:06.902
| struck it full-square.

33:07.486 --> 33:09.613
| wondered how it endured.

33:09.822 --> 33:13.325
There are those that
believe this creature,

33:13.492 --> 33:15.452
this griffin,

33:17.079 --> 33:20.791
is a creature of magic.
That only magic can destroy it.

33:21.792 --> 33:22.918
Do you believe this?

33:24.378 --> 33:26.881
It doesn't matter what I believe.

33:27.089 --> 33:29.633
The use of magic is not permitted.

33:30.467 --> 33:33.304
The knights must prevail
with steel and sinew alone.

33:33.387 --> 33:34.555
Sire.

33:35.139 --> 33:37.433
There is a horse waiting outside.

33:46.942 --> 33:49.904
No. No, please.

33:51.530 --> 33:54.658
It's not my freedom I seek.
| only wish to serve with honor.

33:54.742 --> 33:56.535
- I Know.
-Then let me ride with you, sire.

33:56.619 --> 33:58.954
| cannot.

33:59.622 --> 34:02.124
My father knows nothing of this.
| release you myself.

34:02.208 --> 34:05.711
But I can do no more.
Now go before I change my mind.

34:17.473 --> 34:18.681
There.

34:20.768 --> 34:23.020
You must do this for Arthur.

34:25.898 --> 34:28.775
I've never cast a spell
of enchantment this powerful.

34:28.859 --> 34:30.985
Nothing less will Kill it.

34:31.362 --> 34:33.947
Here. Try.

34:38.661 --> 34:41.413
You have it within you.
| know you do.

34:48.212 --> 34:51.507
(CHANTING)

35:04.436 --> 35:07.898
Don't worry, Merlin.
We have plenty of time.

35:09.900 --> 35:11.193
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

35:12.236 --> 35:13.779
I'm sorry to disturb you, my lady.

35:13.862 --> 35:15.239
Lancelot, what are you doing here?

35:15.322 --> 35:16.657
| have no time to explain.

35:16.740 --> 35:18.367
| need weapons and armor.
The best you've got.

35:18.450 --> 35:19.618
But what's this all about?

35:19.702 --> 35:21.370
Arthur stands in mortal peril.

35:21.453 --> 35:23.122
| must do what I can to protect him.

35:23.414 --> 35:25.416
It's my duty.
Knight or not.

35:26.250 --> 35:28.210
You really believe that, don't you?

35:28.294 --> 35:29.795
Yes, my lady.

35:30.087 --> 35:33.507
Lancelot, I don't believe
| have ever met your like before.

35:33.590 --> 35:36.677
Guinevere, if I should not return...

35:36.760 --> 35:39.471
Don't go, Lancelot. Please.

35:46.103 --> 35:47.563
But go I must.

35:56.822 --> 35:58.198
It's time.

36:12.629 --> 36:15.174
(CHANTING)

36:22.556 --> 36:25.309
(CHANTING)

36:29.480 --> 36:31.231
Don't worry, Merlin.
| know you're trying.

36:31.315 --> 36:33.859
And I'm failing and if Arthur
dies because I'm not good enough...

36:33.942 --> 36:35.069
Merlin!

36:35.152 --> 36:36.236
Merlin!

36:36.320 --> 36:38.238
Lancelot's riding out
to kill the griffin!

36:38.322 --> 36:39.615
He's what?

36:42.576 --> 36:43.827
Merlin!

36:47.623 --> 36:49.666
-I'm coming with you.
-No, you're not.

36:49.750 --> 36:50.918
Just try and stop me.

36:51.001 --> 36:52.336
Merlin, you're not a soldier.

36:52.419 --> 36:53.837
You said it yourself, Lancelot.

36:53.921 --> 36:56.673
Arthur needs all the help he can get.
Now let's go!

37:15.442 --> 37:16.777
(SCREECHING)

37:19.613 --> 37:21.073
For Camelot!

37:22.074 --> 37:23.784
ALL: For Camelot!

37:30.124 --> 37:31.250
(SCREECHING)

37:31.333 --> 37:32.835
(MEN SHOUTING)

37:59.486 --> 38:00.737
Arthur!

38:03.157 --> 38:04.324
Well?

38:04.825 --> 38:06.243
He's alive.

38:06.326 --> 38:07.661
(SCREECHING)

38:35.856 --> 38:37.649
(SCREECHING)

38:46.033 --> 38:48.660
Okay, Merlin.
It's now or never.

38:48.744 --> 38:50.120
(NEIGHING)

38:51.747 --> 38:54.458

(SCREECHING)

39:50.556 --> 39:51.932
(LAUGHING)

39:59.147 --> 40:00.732
(LAUGHING) Yes!

40:02.818 --> 40:04.236
(MOANING)

40:17.416 --> 40:18.625
Lancelot...

40:19.251 --> 40:20.502
Sire...

40:21.795 --> 40:23.213
You did it!

40:24.631 --> 40:26.675
You killed it, Lancelot!

40:31.138 --> 40:32.556
You did it?

40:32.973 --> 40:34.308
| did it.

40:35.183 --> 40:36.560
Thank God!

40:46.778 --> 40:48.697
You did it, my son, you did it!

40:48.780 --> 40:51.825
Not |, Father.
It was Lancelot.

40:54.494 --> 40:55.704
UTHER: What's he doing here?

40:56.288 --> 40:57.873
Father, I can explain.

40:57.956 --> 41:00.500
You! Wait outside!

41:06.048 --> 41:08.175
UTHER: You had no right...

41:12.054 --> 41:13.889
What are they doing?

41:14.014 --> 41:15.724
Deciding my fate.

41:16.642 --> 41:19.686
| confess it, sire. I released him and
I'll take the consequences.

41:19.770 --> 41:22.272
But surely, Lancelot's
actions change things.

41:22.356 --> 41:25.651
His actions change nothing.
He broke the code!

41:25.734 --> 41:27.653
He laid down his life for me!

41:29.529 --> 41:31.406
He served with honor!

41:33.116 --> 41:36.078
| see you feel
strongly about this, Arthur.

41:39.122 --> 41:41.792
Under the circumstances,
a pardon perhaps...

41:41.875 --> 41:43.794
No. Not good enough, Father.

41:45.253 --> 41:48.423
You must restore Lancelot
to his rightful place

41:49.216 --> 41:50.759
as a knight of Camelot.

41:50.842 --> 41:52.386
Never.

41:53.303 --> 41:57.849
The law is the law.
The code bends for no man.

41:57.933 --> 41:59.726
Then the code is wrong!

42:04.439 --> 42:06.608
They'll restore your knighthood.
Of course they will.

42:06.692 --> 42:08.318
You killed the griffin.

42:08.402 --> 42:09.778
But I didn't kill the griffin.

42:12.864 --> 42:13.990
You did.

42:14.491 --> 42:16.243
(LAUGHS) That's ridiculous!

42:16.326 --> 42:20.122
(REPEATS CHANT)
| heard you. I saw you.

42:23.333 --> 42:24.876
Don't worry.
Your secret's safe with me.

42:26.128 --> 42:29.297
But I cannot take the credit
for what I did not do.

42:29.381 --> 42:32.134
There'll be no more lies.
No more deceit.

42:32.926 --> 42:34.761
What are you going to do?

42:34.845 --> 42:36.888
The only thing I can do.

42:40.267 --> 42:41.643
What is this?

42:41.727 --> 42:43.562
-Let me speak!
-Wait!

42:45.230 --> 42:46.773
I'll hear him.

42:48.692 --> 42:50.402
Forgive me, sire.

42:51.403 --> 42:53.071
I've come to bid you farewell.

42:53.989 --> 42:55.699
What is this, Lancelot?

42:55.782 --> 42:58.994
| lied to you both,
and now there is conflict between you.

42:59.119 --> 43:02.873
| cannot bear that burden.
As you should not bear mine.

43:05.625 --> 43:08.545
| must start again,
far from here.

43:09.588 --> 43:13.216
Then, maybe one day,
fate shall grant me another chance

43:14.009 --> 43:16.511
to prove myself
a worthy knight of Camelot.

43:17.304 --> 43:21.641
But, Lancelot,
you've already proved that to us.

43:22.517 --> 43:24.060
Then I must prove it to myself.

43:28.482 --> 43:30.025
Your Highness.

43:31.485 --> 43:32.652
Prince Arthur.

43:44.164 --> 43:45.165
(DOOR CLOSING)

43:51.171 --> 43:53.673
MORGANA: Gwen? Guinevere?

44:01.848 --> 44:03.683
-Lancelot?
-Oh.

44:05.393 --> 44:06.478
Yes.

44:06.561 --> 44:08.772
Come, Gwen. Busy day ahead.

44:09.856 --> 44:10.982
Yes, my lady.

44:14.319 --> 44:16.655
Perhaps you were right, Gaius.

44:16.863 --> 44:18.657
Perhaps I should
never have got involved.

44:19.574 --> 44:20.951
No, Merlin. I was wrong.

44:22.035 --> 44:25.121
Lancelot needed you,
and you needed Lancelot.

44:25.580 --> 44:27.791
Your destinies were entwined.

44:28.250 --> 44:30.085
Will he ever return?

44:30.544 --> 44:32.337
That, I cannot say.

44:33.421 --> 44:37.050
Till the next time then,
Sir Lancelot.

44:58.071 --> 45:02.909
My name is Edwin Muirden,
and I have a remedy to cure all ills.

45:03.118 --> 45:05.620
GAIUS: We cannot preserve
her life for much longer.

45:05.704 --> 45:07.831
She has hours, maybe less.

45:07.998 --> 45:09.207
You have magic?

45:09.291 --> 45:12.377
| wonder what Uther will do?
Probably have him burned.

45:12.460 --> 45:13.545
(LAUGHING EVILLY)

45:13.628 --> 45:15.422
MERLIN: Find Edwin.
