WEBVTT

00:16.792 --> 00:19.875
EDDIE...WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU DOING HERE?

00:19.875 --> 00:21.041
RIGHT. UM--

00:21.041 --> 00:22.834
WHAT HAPPENED
TO CALIFORNIA?

00:22.834 --> 00:24.333
WELL, IT'S STILL THERE.

00:24.333 --> 00:26.166
YOU KNOW, I JUST KINDA
LEFT FOR A WHILE.

00:26.166 --> 00:27.333
AND WHAT HAPPENED
TO SCHOOL?

00:27.333 --> 00:28.875
AGAIN, STILL THERE.

00:28.875 --> 00:30.667
STILL STANDING WITHOUT
ME AND EVERYTHING.

00:30.667 --> 00:31.917
IT'S HARD TO
BELIEVE, I KNOW.

00:33.166 --> 00:36.000
LOOK, I START
IN THE FALL.

00:36.000 --> 00:38.667
EVERYTHING
WORKED OUT, JO.
EVERYTHING, JO.

00:38.667 --> 00:40.708
I MEAN, I HAD THIS
INTERVIEW, RIGHT?

00:40.708 --> 00:43.250
AND I DIDN'T STUTTER
OR STUMBLE OR THROW UP
OR ANYTHING,

00:43.250 --> 00:44.041
AND THEY LOVED
MY WRITING,

00:44.041 --> 00:46.417
WHICH IS JUST
TOTALLY, LIKE, SURREAL

00:46.417 --> 00:50.375
BECAUSE NO ONE
HAS EVER LOVED
ANYTHING I'VE DONE.

00:51.542 --> 00:52.834
EXCEPT FOR YOU.

00:52.834 --> 00:56.625
WHICH IS WHY I'M HERE.

00:56.625 --> 01:00.041
I WANTED TO SAY
THANK YOU.

01:00.041 --> 01:03.625
BECAUSE YOU KNEW
I COULD DO IT,
AND I HAD NO IDEA.

01:05.375 --> 01:08.875
YOU KNOW, JO, IT'S NOT
JUST BECAUSE I DIDN'T
THINK I COULD DO IT.

01:08.875 --> 01:12.041
IT'S BECAUSE I DIDN'T
SEE THE WORLD THAT WAY.

01:12.041 --> 01:13.875
YOU KNOW? IT'S A PLACE
WHERE PEOPLE GET SECOND

01:13.875 --> 01:17.333
AND THIRD AND FOURTH
CHANCES TO MAKE
SOMETHING OF THEMSELVES.

01:18.417 --> 01:20.250
OR AS
A PLACE WHERE...

01:20.250 --> 01:23.875
YOU CAN BE A COWARD,

01:23.875 --> 01:27.750
AND HURT SOMEONE. HEY.

01:27.750 --> 01:31.959
BUT THEY STILL HAVE
THE DECENCY TO SEE
THE DECENCY IN YOU.

01:33.208 --> 01:35.041
AND, JOEY,

01:35.041 --> 01:38.708
YOU ARE THE MOST
DECENT PERSON I KNOW.

01:38.708 --> 01:41.875
AND YOU HAVE
INCREDIBLE EYES

01:41.875 --> 01:44.583
AND THE SEXIEST VOICE

01:44.583 --> 01:46.834
AND A SMILE
THAT BREAKS MY HEART.

01:47.917 --> 01:49.708
AND IF I'M GONNA
BE A WRITER,

01:49.708 --> 01:52.875
I NEED SOMEONE
LIKE THAT AROUND.

01:55.041 --> 01:58.917
I NEED YOU AROUND.

01:58.917 --> 02:01.000
WHAT DO YOU SAY?

02:07.500 --> 02:09.792
NO.

02:09.792 --> 02:11.875
NO.

02:13.458 --> 02:16.458
WELL, THAT'S NOT
THE ANSWER THAT I'M
LOOKING FOR, REALLY.

02:16.458 --> 02:19.959
EDDIE, YOU WALKED AWAY.

02:19.959 --> 02:21.542
I CAME BACK.

02:24.917 --> 02:26.667
I MOVED ON.

02:32.125 --> 02:34.625
OH.

02:37.542 --> 02:38.959
OK.

02:41.125 --> 02:43.583
IF THAT'S HOW
YOU FEEL, THEN...

02:43.583 --> 02:46.333
OK, I UNDERSTAND.

02:46.333 --> 02:48.834
I DO.

02:48.834 --> 02:52.000
I GUESS I'LL BE
SEEING YOU, JOEY.

02:53.625 --> 02:55.583
I'M SORRY.

03:59.000 --> 04:02.500
BRUTAL. DO NOT
LET YOUR ENEMIES HAVE
ACCESS TO THIS CLOSET.

04:03.708 --> 04:04.708
TELL ME
THIS WAS PURCHASED

04:04.708 --> 04:07.708
FOR SOME SORT OF HALLOWEEN
CHURCH LADY COSTUME.

04:07.708 --> 04:09.834
IT LOOKS
MUCH BETTER ON.

04:09.834 --> 04:12.125
KEEP TELLING
YOURSELF THAT, SWEETIE.

04:12.125 --> 04:14.458
YOU KNOW, PERHAPS
YOU'D LIKE TO FOCUS
ON THE TASK AT HAND

04:14.458 --> 04:17.250
SO YOU CAN HURRY UP
AND GO AND LEAVE ME
TO MY WORK.

04:17.250 --> 04:19.916
IF YOU'RE GONNA BE
CHAPERONING MY SEMI-FORMAL,

04:19.916 --> 04:23.917
I NEED YOU TO
WEAR SOMETHING
THAT'S MODERATELY HIP

04:23.917 --> 04:25.917
SO I DON'T
LOOK LIKE A FREAK
ASSOCIATING WITH YOU.

04:25.917 --> 04:29.041
NOT LIKE SULTRY,
OLDER WOMAN SEXY.

04:29.041 --> 04:31.250
(SCOFFS)
WHAT AM I SAYING?

04:31.250 --> 04:32.917
I'D NEVER FIND
ANYTHING LIKE THAT
IN THIS CLOSET.

04:32.917 --> 04:35.125
DID I ACTUALLY
AGREE TO THIS?

04:36.375 --> 04:38.375
OH, THAT'S AUDREY'S.

04:38.375 --> 04:40.083
I COULD BORROW IT.

04:40.083 --> 04:42.208
NO WAY.

04:42.208 --> 04:44.125
YOU NEED TO LOOK GOOD,
BUT NOT TOO GOOD.

04:44.125 --> 04:46.542
THE MEN AT MILTON ARE
WEAK OF CONSTITUTION

04:46.542 --> 04:49.083
AND HIGHLY SUSCEPTIBLE
TO THE WILES OF
THE OLDER WOMAN.

04:49.083 --> 04:51.083
SO, SEEING AS
IT'S MY NIGHT,

04:51.083 --> 04:53.959
AND MY FAIR-WEATHER,
JACK-OF-NO-TRADES,
BOYFRIEND PATRICK

04:53.959 --> 04:55.417
IS GOING TO BE THERE,

04:55.417 --> 04:58.041
AND HE HAS SOME SORT OF
UNHOLY ATTACHMENT TO YOU,

04:58.041 --> 05:00.333
WE'RE GONNA KEEP
YOUR WILES COVERED.

05:00.333 --> 05:02.792
UNDER...

05:02.792 --> 05:05.959
THIS LOVELY
SUBDUED DRESS.

05:07.750 --> 05:10.417
EW! WHAT
IS THIS, RAYON?

05:10.417 --> 05:12.834
IT'S SILK.

05:12.834 --> 05:14.291
BLEND.

05:15.750 --> 05:17.750
IT'S PERFECT.

05:17.750 --> 05:19.083
NOT TOO PERFECT.

05:20.291 --> 05:22.125
HARLEY, LOOK,

05:22.125 --> 05:24.083
I SWEAR TO KEEP MY
MRS. ROBINSON CLAWS

05:24.083 --> 05:25.625
OFF YOUR BOYFRIEND.

05:25.625 --> 05:28.125
BUT CAN YOU GO?
I HAVE A LOT
OF WORK TO DO.

05:28.125 --> 05:30.834
YEAH, BUT DO YOU THINK
I SHOULD GO PASTIES
OR STRAPLESS?

05:30.834 --> 05:33.166
NEITHER!
I'M CONSIDERING

05:33.166 --> 05:35.500
INVESTING IN
A CHASTITY BELT
FOR YOU.

05:35.500 --> 05:37.125
PUSHING YOUR
BUTTONS, POTTER.

05:37.125 --> 05:38.625
OUT.

05:38.625 --> 05:39.750
I'M OUT.

05:40.834 --> 05:44.375
OH. HEH!
I LOOK RIDICULOUS.

05:44.375 --> 05:48.500
NO, YOU DON'T.
YOU LOOK BEAUTIFUL
AND GLOWING.

05:48.500 --> 05:51.000
AND DEFINITELY LIKE
YOU JUST PARTOOK
OF YOUR BOYFRIEND.

05:51.959 --> 05:53.875
GREAT.
MM-HMM.

05:58.667 --> 06:00.959
AND ALL THE MORE
BEAUTIFUL FOR IT.

06:04.333 --> 06:06.500
YOU LINDLEY WOMEN
ARE SOMETHING ELSE.

06:06.500 --> 06:09.083
YOU KNOW, GRAMS
BROKE UNCLE BILL'S HEART.

06:09.083 --> 06:11.166
THAT MAN IS
A SHELL OF HIMSELF.

06:11.166 --> 06:12.333
CAN'T EVEN WATCH
WHEEL OF FORTUNE  ANYMORE

06:12.333 --> 06:14.208
BECAUSE VANNA WHITE REMINDS
HIM OF HIS DEVASTATION.

06:14.208 --> 06:16.166
MY GRAMS,
THE BLACK WIDOW.
WHO KNEW?

06:16.166 --> 06:18.250
(CHUCKLES)

06:18.250 --> 06:20.333
ALL RIGHT.
I SHOULD GO.

06:20.333 --> 06:21.875
NO, YOU SHOULDN'T.

06:21.875 --> 06:23.667
NO.

06:23.667 --> 06:24.959
YOU'RE THE ONE
WHO MADE ME
GET OUT OF BED.

06:24.959 --> 06:28.250
I KNOW, BUT
I'M WOMAN ENOUGH TO ADMIT
WHEN I'VE MADE A MISTAKE.

06:32.542 --> 06:33.583
YEAH, YOU SHOULD GO.

06:33.583 --> 06:34.834
MM-HMM.

06:34.834 --> 06:36.542
OH, GOD.
YOU GOTTA GO.

06:36.542 --> 06:38.542
YEAH.
YEAH.

06:38.542 --> 06:40.041
ALL RIGHT.
WELL, UM...

06:40.041 --> 06:41.834
LOOK, I'LL SEE
WHAT I CAN FIND OUT
ABOUT GRAMS.

06:41.834 --> 06:42.834
OK.

06:42.834 --> 06:44.208
I'LL CALL YOU
LATER.

06:44.208 --> 06:45.375
OK.
OK.

06:45.375 --> 06:46.708
LATER.
BYE.

06:46.708 --> 06:47.834
BYE.

06:58.583 --> 07:00.834
(CELL PHONE RINGS)

07:08.041 --> 07:09.083
HELLO?

07:09.083 --> 07:11.583
HI. IS THIS
POTTER'S HOUSE OF PAIN?

07:11.583 --> 07:14.250
THIS IS MISTRESS
JOEY SPEAKING.

07:14.250 --> 07:17.125
I'M GLAD I CAUGHT YOU.
I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT HAVE
GONE OUT OF BUSINESS.

07:17.125 --> 07:18.917
I WAS EXPECTING YOU
LAST NIGHT.

07:18.917 --> 07:21.125
YEAH, I, UM...

07:21.125 --> 07:23.583
YOU KNOW, I FINISHED
UP AT THE BAR,

07:23.583 --> 07:26.417
AND I WAS JUST
EXHAUSTED, AND...

07:26.417 --> 07:28.375
NO ENERGY LEFT
FOR THE NAUGHTY
STOCKBROKERS.

07:28.375 --> 07:29.291
THAT'S OK.
I UNDERSTAND.

07:29.291 --> 07:31.000
I WAS KIND OF TUCKERED OUT
MYSELF LAST NIGHT.

07:31.000 --> 07:32.375
LOOK, HERE'S
WHAT I'M THINKING.

07:32.375 --> 07:34.750
LAST NIGHT, WE WERE
VERY OLD PEOPLE.

07:34.750 --> 07:36.875
BUT TONIGHT, LET'S
AT LEAST PRETEND LIKE
WE'RE YOUNG PEOPLE.

07:36.875 --> 07:40.417
GO OUT LATE,
STUMBLE HOME VERY LATE.
WHAT DO YOU SAY?

07:40.417 --> 07:42.166
I HAVE PLANS.

07:43.000 --> 07:44.583
NO.

07:44.583 --> 07:47.917
YEAH. I PROMISED HARLEY
I'D DO HER A FAVOR.

07:47.917 --> 07:50.125
WHAT EXACTLY
DOES ROSEMARY'S
BABY WANT?

07:50.125 --> 07:53.375
SHE WANTS ME TO CHAPERONE
THE MILTON SEMI-FORMAL.

07:53.375 --> 07:55.500
WOULD THAT
INVOLVE YOU
BEING IN A DRESS?

07:55.500 --> 07:56.959
MM-HMM.

07:56.959 --> 07:58.291
AND HEELS?

07:58.291 --> 08:00.166
POSSIBLY.

08:00.166 --> 08:01.959
WELL, OK.
CONSIDER MY ARM TWISTED.
I'LL BE THERE.

08:01.959 --> 08:04.291
(LAUGHS) WHAT?
I MEAN, REALLY?

08:04.291 --> 08:07.500
IT'S...IT'S
A FRIDAY NIGHT.
ARE YOU SURE?

08:07.500 --> 08:10.125
I'M SURE AS RAIN.

08:10.125 --> 08:13.500
GREAT. UM, MEET ME
HERE AT 6:00.

08:13.500 --> 08:14.500
I'LL SEE YOU THERE.

08:14.500 --> 08:15.834
SHOE SHINED
AND SUIT PRESSED.

08:18.917 --> 08:19.959
PACEY WITTER.

08:19.959 --> 08:22.375
DAWSON! HI!

08:22.375 --> 08:24.583
WELCOME TO THE DREAM
MACHINE, MY FRIEND.

08:26.166 --> 08:27.291
CAN YOU SMELL
THE MONEY GROWING?

08:27.291 --> 08:29.959
UH, IF IT SMELLS
LIKE DRAKAR NOIR,

08:29.959 --> 08:32.000
THEN YEAH, BIG TIME.

08:32.000 --> 08:33.750
WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE?

08:37.875 --> 08:38.833
WHAT'S THIS?

08:38.833 --> 08:42.000
IT'S ALL THE MONEY
I SAVED WORKING
WITH TODD.

08:42.000 --> 08:43.625
I NEED YOU
TO MAKE IT GROW.

08:45.375 --> 08:46.667
YOU NEED TO SLOW DOWN
FOR JUST A SECOND--

08:46.667 --> 08:49.500
TRANSFORM THAT INTO
A RESPECTABLE BUDGET
FOR AN INDIE FILM.

08:49.500 --> 08:51.000
COMING OF AGE STORY.
NO SPECIAL EFFECTS,

08:51.000 --> 08:53.125
ALTHOUGH I MIGHT NEED
A SLUMMING A-LIST ACTOR

08:53.125 --> 08:54.333
LOOKING FOR SOME
INDUSTRY CRED.

08:54.333 --> 08:55.333
YOU UP FOR IT?

08:58.166 --> 08:59.792
WOULD YOU MIND
STEPPING INTO MY
OFFICE FOR ONE SEC?

08:59.792 --> 09:01.625
SURE.

09:05.041 --> 09:06.834
YOU KNOW THAT THING
THAT I TOLD YOU
I COULD DO FOR YA?

09:06.834 --> 09:08.542
UH, YEAH.

09:08.542 --> 09:11.625
I WAS ACTUALLY
KIND OF KIDDING.

09:11.625 --> 09:13.708
WELL, BUT,
UH--(WHISTLES)

09:13.708 --> 09:15.041
THAT'S WHAT YOU
DO FOR A LIVING, RIGHT?

09:15.041 --> 09:15.834
IS INVEST MONEY
FOR OTHER PEOPLE?

09:15.834 --> 09:16.875
SHH. SHH.

09:16.875 --> 09:19.208
TECHNICALLY, YES.

09:20.333 --> 09:21.333
(WHISPERS) Why
are we whispering?

09:21.333 --> 09:23.000
BECAUSE IF THE GUYS
EVER HEARD ME

09:23.000 --> 09:25.333
TURNING DOWN
INVESTMENT MONEY
BASED ON MORAL REASONS,

09:25.333 --> 09:27.041
I WOULD BE
PROFESSIONALLY
CASTRATED.

09:27.041 --> 09:27.792
WHAT MORAL REASONS?

09:29.333 --> 09:31.166
I HAVEN'T EXACTLY
HAMMERED OUT

09:31.166 --> 09:34.250
MY MIXING FRIENDS AND
BUSINESS POLICY YET.

09:34.250 --> 09:36.041
PACE, I THINK WE'VE
BEEN THROUGH ENOUGH

09:36.041 --> 09:38.083
THAT WE DON'T HAVE TO WORRY
ABOUT IT GETTING AWKWARD.

09:38.083 --> 09:39.542
WELL, YES,
WE'VE CERTAINLY
BEEN THROUGH AWKWARD,

09:39.542 --> 09:40.375
BUT WE'VE
NEVER BEEN THROUGH

09:40.375 --> 09:41.834
"I'M BROKE AND
IT'S ALL YOUR FAULT."

09:41.834 --> 09:43.500
I'M NOT WORRIED.

09:43.500 --> 09:45.417
I KNOW THIS WILL SOUND
DISGUSTINGLY L.A. OF ME,

09:45.417 --> 09:49.083
BUT THIS WHOLE PROJECT
JUST HAS A REALLY GOOD VIBE.

09:49.083 --> 09:51.959
BECAUSE I'M
YOUR FRIEND...

09:51.959 --> 09:54.250
I'M NEVER GONNA TELL
ANYBODY THAT YOU JUST
USED THE WORD "VIBE".

09:54.250 --> 09:57.083
I'M SERIOUS, MAN.
I JUST...

09:57.083 --> 09:59.250
I MADE A DECISION
TO TRUST MY INSTINCTS,

09:59.250 --> 10:01.125
AND EVER SINCE I DID,
EVERYTHING'S BEEN
FALLING INTO PLACE.

10:01.125 --> 10:02.583
I WROTE 20 PAGES
LAST NIGHT.

10:02.583 --> 10:05.041
I COULD BARELY
TYPE FAST ENOUGH

10:05.041 --> 10:06.458
TO KEEP UP WITH THE IDEAS
THAT WERE COMING,

10:06.458 --> 10:08.291
AND I CAN'T WAIT
TO GO HOME AND WRITE MORE.

10:08.291 --> 10:10.542
I MEAN, HONESTLY,
THE ONLY THING

10:10.542 --> 10:13.500
HOLDING ALL THIS UP
RIGHT NOW IS YOU.

10:26.000 --> 10:28.542
GRAMS, GRAMS, GRAMS,
WE GOTTA CHAT.

10:30.500 --> 10:32.041
WHY'D YOU
DROP THE HAMMER
ON UNCLE BILL?

10:32.041 --> 10:34.166
THE MAN IS DISTRAUGHT.

10:34.166 --> 10:39.166
WELL, APPARENTLY,
HE HAS SWORN OFF
WOMEN FOR LIFE.

10:39.166 --> 10:40.959
OF COURSE, IF WE'RE
SPEAKING FRANKLY,

10:40.959 --> 10:42.959
I DON'T KNOW HOW LONG
THAT COULD ACTUALLY BE.

10:42.959 --> 10:44.125
JENNIFER.

10:44.125 --> 10:46.125
YOU KNOW WHAT'S FUNNY,
THOUGH, IS THAT,

10:46.125 --> 10:49.667
WELL, I'M EMBARKING ON
A SOMEWHAT FUNCTIONAL,

10:49.667 --> 10:51.625
POSSIBLY EVEN
FULLY COMMITTED
RELATIONSHIP.

10:51.625 --> 10:54.458
YOU, WHO ARE
2 GENERATIONS MY SENIOR,

10:54.458 --> 10:55.959
ARE BEHAVING LIKE
A FICKLE TEENAGER.

10:55.959 --> 10:57.959
YOU ARE BREAKING HEARTS
LEFT AND RIGHT.

10:57.959 --> 10:59.667
I MOST CERTAINLY
AM NOT.

11:01.792 --> 11:04.166
OK. OUTBURST.

11:05.959 --> 11:08.208
PERHAPS I SHOULD
BE SLIPPING SOME
ST. JOHN'S WORT

11:08.208 --> 11:10.291
INTO YOUR
MORNING METAMUCIL.

11:36.000 --> 11:37.834
(KNOCK ON DOOR)

11:38.834 --> 11:40.125
HEY.

11:40.125 --> 11:42.125
HI. OH, MY LORD.

11:42.125 --> 11:44.166
YOU ARE WAY TOO HOT
TO BE A CHAPERONE.

11:44.166 --> 11:45.375
I THINK
I'M LIVING OUT

11:45.375 --> 11:47.333
ONE OF MY TEENAGE
FANTASIES RIGHT NOW.

11:47.333 --> 11:49.542
WELL, YOU LOOK
QUITE COMELY YOURSELF.

11:49.542 --> 11:51.583
OH, THIS
OLD THING? NAH.

11:51.583 --> 11:54.208
OK, NOW,

11:54.208 --> 11:57.208
IN ORDER TO MAKE UP FOR
OUR LAST HIGH SCHOOL
DANCE EXPERIENCE,

11:57.208 --> 11:58.750
IN WHICH I DID ACTUALLY
BUY YOU A CORSAGE,

11:58.750 --> 12:00.458
BUT THEN I LET IT WILT
TO A LOVELY SHADE OF BROWN,

12:00.458 --> 12:01.500
I BROUGHT YOU OPTIONS.

12:01.500 --> 12:04.750
IN BOX "A"...

12:04.750 --> 12:07.834
WE HAVE THE CORSAGE
FOR THE FUN-LOVING
AND WHIMSICAL JOEY--

12:07.834 --> 12:09.667
A CARVED RADISH ON
A BED OF BABY CARROTS.

12:09.667 --> 12:13.750
AND THEN, OPTION "B"...

12:13.750 --> 12:16.875
THE CORSAGE
FOR THE CLASSIC AND
SOPHISTICATED JOEY--

12:16.875 --> 12:18.667
ROSES ON A BED
OF BABY'S BREATH,

12:18.667 --> 12:20.667
WHICH HAS A CREEPY NAME
BUT IS A CLASSIC FLOWER.

12:20.667 --> 12:23.000
WELL, IN HONOR
OF THE YOUTH

12:23.000 --> 12:25.208
WITH WHOM WE'LL BE
SHARING THE DANCE FLOOR,

12:25.208 --> 12:26.875
I THINK I'M GONNA
GO WITH OPTION "A."

12:26.875 --> 12:28.041
THE VEGGIES.

12:28.041 --> 12:30.208
ALL RIGHT.
VEGGIES IT IS.

12:35.417 --> 12:36.417
(CHUCKLES)

12:36.417 --> 12:37.917
COOL.

12:37.917 --> 12:41.917
AND, IN HONOR
OF THE CLASSY GUY
YOU ARE TONIGHT--

12:41.917 --> 12:43.041
DON'T BE FOOLED.
IT'S JUST A COSTUME.

12:43.041 --> 12:45.250
NO, REALLY.

12:45.250 --> 12:47.542
YOU GET A ROSE.

12:48.792 --> 12:50.750
IT'S PERFECT.

12:50.750 --> 12:52.125
SHALL WE?

12:56.083 --> 12:57.083
THIS'LL BE FUN.

12:57.083 --> 12:59.875
YEAH. A FLASHBACK.

13:30.083 --> 13:31.959
Joey: NICE NIGHT.

13:34.291 --> 13:36.834
I JUST LOVE THE SMELL
OF SECRET ANTIPERSPIRANT
IN THE EVENING.

13:38.291 --> 13:40.750
IT HAD TO BE SAID.

13:44.458 --> 13:47.125
THIS WHOLE NIGHT
BITES ALREADY.

13:47.125 --> 13:48.291
I HAVEN'T EVEN
GOTTEN TO THE PART

13:48.291 --> 13:49.792
WHERE MY FRIENDS
SWARM AROUND ME

13:49.792 --> 13:52.041
AND SHRIEK ABOUT
HOW MUCH THEY
LOVE MY DRESS.

13:52.041 --> 13:53.667
HARLEY, YOU'RE
NOT THE FIRST WOMEN

13:53.667 --> 13:54.792
IN THE HISTORY
OF SEMI-FORMALS

13:54.792 --> 13:57.000
TO ACCOMPANY
A NON-DANCING DATE.

13:57.000 --> 13:59.875
MR. WITTER OVER HERE
WAS FAMOUSLY
UNCOOPERATIVE

13:59.875 --> 14:00.834
WHEN IT CAME TO
THE BOOTY SHAKE.

14:00.834 --> 14:02.000
HEY, I DANCED.

14:02.000 --> 14:03.834
UNDER DURESS.

14:03.834 --> 14:05.417
AND HE BROKE UP WITH ME
AT OUR SENIOR PROM,

14:05.417 --> 14:07.875
SO WE NEVER HAD
THE CHANCE TO DANCE
AT OUR OWN PROM.

14:07.875 --> 14:09.834
OK. DIRTY LAUNDRY, JOE.
LET IT GO.

14:09.834 --> 14:10.750
HAD TO BE SAID.

14:12.250 --> 14:14.500
THIS GUY'S OBVIOUSLY
NOT OF SOUND MIND

14:14.500 --> 14:16.667
TO HURT THE FEELINGS
OF A BABE LIKE YOU.

14:19.000 --> 14:20.834
HARLEY.

14:20.834 --> 14:22.000
Harley: I LOVE
YOUR DRESS!

14:22.000 --> 14:23.542
CUTE!

14:23.542 --> 14:24.834
THANKS.

14:24.834 --> 14:26.458
A LITTLE TOO AGUILERA
FOR A SCHOOL EVENT,

14:26.458 --> 14:28.000
BUT MAYBE IT'S JUST ME.

14:28.000 --> 14:29.667
JUST KEEP IT DOWN,
ALL RIGHT?

14:29.667 --> 14:31.500
YOUR FRIEND OVER THERE
MIGHT THINK I'M ATTACHED.

14:31.500 --> 14:32.708
I HATE YOU.

14:32.708 --> 14:34.333
PATRICK, PERHAPS
YOU'D LIKE TO

14:34.333 --> 14:35.417
GO OVER TO
THE PUNCH BOWL

14:35.417 --> 14:36.875
AND RETRIEVE
SOME DRINKS?

14:36.875 --> 14:38.625
I THINK SHE
MIGHT WANNA CLAW
YOUR EYES OUT.

14:43.750 --> 14:46.041
HAVE YOU EVER NOTICED
HOW MUCH THAT DRESS
BRINGS OUT YOUR EYES?

14:46.041 --> 14:47.750
NO.

14:47.750 --> 14:49.166
OH, WELL, IT DOES.

14:49.166 --> 14:50.875
YOU LOOK
SO PRETTY TONIGHT,

14:50.875 --> 14:52.917
AND I BET IF YOU AND I
WERE TO STEP OUT
ON THE DANCE FLOOR,

14:52.917 --> 14:54.917
YOU WOULD BE,
BY FAR, THE MOST
BEAUTIFUL WOMAN ON IT.

14:54.917 --> 14:56.834
DUH.

15:02.041 --> 15:03.792
AHEM.

15:06.417 --> 15:08.041
WHAT?

15:08.041 --> 15:10.250
OH, BEVERAGES.

15:10.250 --> 15:11.875
I WAS WONDERING WHY
I WENT OVER THERE.

15:17.542 --> 15:19.000
YOU KNOW,
I SHOULD TELL YOU

15:19.000 --> 15:20.583
THAT I HAPPEN TO BE
CLOSE, PERSONAL FRIENDS

15:20.583 --> 15:22.083
WITH WOODY KULCHAK,

15:22.083 --> 15:24.875
WHO HAS SNUCK IN A BOTTLE
OF PEACH SCHNAPPS TONIGHT.

15:24.875 --> 15:28.291
SO, IF YOU'D
LIKE THIS DANCE
TO BE TRULY MAGICAL,

15:28.291 --> 15:31.375
I COULD ARRANGE
FOR COCKTAILS FOR 2
UNDERNEATH THE BLEACHERS.

15:31.375 --> 15:33.625
JUST GIVE ME THE WORD.

15:33.625 --> 15:35.917
NO.

15:37.625 --> 15:40.375
THINK ABOUT IT, BABE.

15:42.417 --> 15:43.750
HEY, WHAT'S ALL THIS?

15:43.750 --> 15:46.250
AH. RETURNING
TO MY YOUTH
FOR INSPIRATION.

15:46.250 --> 15:48.250
HAVE YOU SEEN
MY HOOK  POSTER?

15:48.250 --> 15:49.625
UM, NO,
NOT RECENTLY.

15:49.625 --> 15:51.708
UH, MAYBE YOU COULD
CHECK THE ATTIC.

15:53.750 --> 15:55.917
SO, NOW THAT
YOU ARE REVISITING 15,

15:55.917 --> 15:57.708
DOES THAT MEAN
I HAVE TO START PAYING
YOU AN ALLOWANCE AGAIN?

16:00.125 --> 16:01.625
I DON'T EVER RECALL YOU
GIVING ME AN ALLOWANCE.

16:01.625 --> 16:03.583
WHAT ARE YOU
GONNA DO FOR MONEY?

16:04.959 --> 16:06.625
IT'S FAIRLY INEXPENSIVE
TO LIVE AT HOME.

16:06.625 --> 16:09.625
HENCE THE
LIVING AT HOME.

16:09.625 --> 16:11.792
AH. MEANING
THAT YOU DON'T
PLAN TO CONTRIBUTE

16:11.792 --> 16:13.375
TO THE
HOUSEHOLD EXPENSES.

16:14.917 --> 16:18.125
WELL, I ABSOLUTELY CAN...
IF YOU WANT ME TO.

16:18.125 --> 16:21.792
I MEAN, I CAN GET
A PART TIME JOB OR...

16:21.792 --> 16:24.291
I'LL BABY-SIT LILY.
THAT WAY YOU DON'T HAVE TO
PAY SOMEBODY ELSE TO DO IT.

16:24.291 --> 16:26.333
THAT'S NOT WHAT
I'M GETTING AT, DAWSON.

16:27.333 --> 16:28.834
WHAT ARE YOU GETTING AT?

16:28.834 --> 16:30.667
WHAT I'M WONDERING
IS HOW DO YOU INTEND

16:30.667 --> 16:32.959
TO MAKE MONEY
IN THE LONG TERM?

16:32.959 --> 16:33.959
WHAT'S YOUR PLAN?

16:33.959 --> 16:36.458
ALL RIGHT.

16:36.458 --> 16:38.625
UM...

16:38.625 --> 16:41.083
THE PLAN IS
WRITE THIS MOVIE,

16:41.083 --> 16:43.667
SHOOT IT, FINISH IT,
SEND IT OFF TO FESTIVALS.

16:43.667 --> 16:45.667
HOPEFULLY IT'LL BE
GOOD ENOUGH TO GET
PICKED UP AND DISTRIBUTED

16:45.667 --> 16:48.625
AND WILL MAKE ENOUGH MONEY
TO THEN FINANCE
MY NEXT PROJECT.

16:48.625 --> 16:50.500
I MEAN WHAT'S YOUR
BACKUP PLAN?

16:50.500 --> 16:53.375
IF DIRECTING
DOESN'T WORK.

16:55.000 --> 16:56.834
WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
IF DIRECTING DOESN'T WORK?

16:56.834 --> 17:00.834
MAKING A LIVING AS
A FILM DIRECTOR IS A
ONE IN A MILLION CHANCE.

17:00.834 --> 17:04.000
NOW, I KNOW YOU DON'T
WANNA HEAR THIS, BUT...

17:04.000 --> 17:05.875
YOU NEED TO
BE PRACTICAL.

18:09.875 --> 18:11.917
THEN I GOT BUMPED UP
TO JUNIOR VARSITY

18:11.917 --> 18:13.583
WHEN CY WATSON
TORE HIS ACHILLES.

18:13.583 --> 18:15.750
(LAUGHS)

18:15.750 --> 18:18.083
WELL, YOU PROBABLY
HEARD THAT I WAS
ALL-STATE LAST YEAR,

18:18.083 --> 18:20.375
BECAUSE, YOU KNOW,
I MEAN, I'M A GOOD
OUTSIDE SHOOTER,

18:20.375 --> 18:21.542
AND I CAN DUNK,
WHICH IS GOOD FOR
SOMEBODY MY AGE,

18:21.542 --> 18:22.792
AND I'M A GOOD PASSER.

18:22.792 --> 18:24.417
BUT, I MEAN, I'VE ALWAYS
BEEN REALLY GOOD.

18:24.417 --> 18:25.917
I SCORE, LIKE,
30 POINTS A GAME.

18:27.417 --> 18:29.708
WHAT KIND OF SCHOOL DANCE
ACTUALLY HAS A PUNCH BOWL?

18:29.708 --> 18:31.750
A SCHMANCY PRIVATE
SCHOOL DANCE.

18:31.750 --> 18:34.083
WELL, I HOPE FOR
THE SAKE OF ALL INVOLVED,

18:34.083 --> 18:35.792
THAT SOME INTREPID STUDENT
HAS SPIKED THIS PUNCH,

18:35.792 --> 18:37.250
OR ELSE IT KINDA LOSES OUT
ON ITS CLICHE VALUE.

18:37.250 --> 18:39.000
HMM.

18:39.000 --> 18:40.125
SPEAKING OF, WHEN DO
WE GET OUR PICTURE TAKEN

18:40.125 --> 18:41.250
IN FRONT OF
THE TROPICAL MURAL?

18:41.250 --> 18:42.375
THAT WOULD BE PROM.

18:43.625 --> 18:45.458
RIGHT.
BLOCKED PROM OUT.

18:45.458 --> 18:46.250
AS YOU SHOULD.

18:46.250 --> 18:48.458
IT WASN'T EXACTLY
YOUR FINEST HOUR.

18:48.458 --> 18:50.125
WELL, I WAS
TROUBLED BACK THEN.

18:50.125 --> 18:51.625
YOU KNOW,
JAMES DEAN TYPE.

18:51.625 --> 18:54.000
YOU WERE A DUMBASS.

18:55.792 --> 18:58.500
WAS I AT LEAST
A MYSTERIOUS DUMBASS

18:58.500 --> 19:01.250
WITH SMOLDERING
SEX APPEAL?

19:01.250 --> 19:03.333
DUMBASS.

19:03.333 --> 19:05.750
OK, FINE.
I CAN ACCEPT THAT.

19:05.750 --> 19:07.250
'CAUSE NOW I'M
A HAPPY DUMBASS.

19:07.250 --> 19:09.083
I GOT
A SECOND CHANCE.

19:12.417 --> 19:14.125
PACE, WE SHOULD--

19:14.125 --> 19:15.583
FINE. FINE.

19:15.583 --> 19:17.333
Harley: PATRICK,
LET GO OF HIM!

19:17.333 --> 19:18.417
LET GO OF HIM!

19:18.417 --> 19:19.917
WHY SHOULD I?

19:19.917 --> 19:21.291
YOU GUYS WERE DANCING
PELVIS TO PELVIS

19:21.291 --> 19:22.792
LIKE IT WAS
GOING OUT OF STYLE.

19:22.792 --> 19:25.458
IT WAS MY ONLY RECOURSE
AFTER YOU FAILED ME
IN EVERY WAY!

19:25.458 --> 19:26.792
JAMIE CAME TO MY AID!

19:26.792 --> 19:29.333
JAMIE IS NOT
YOUR DATE! I AM!

19:29.333 --> 19:30.333
IN NAME ONLY!

19:30.333 --> 19:31.500
DID YOU DO
ONE DATE-LIKE THING

19:31.500 --> 19:32.500
THE ENTIRE NIGHT?

19:32.500 --> 19:34.583
THIS IS DATE-LIKE!

19:35.667 --> 19:37.333
ARE YOU
GONNA DO SOMETHING?

19:37.333 --> 19:39.125
OH, YEAH. OF COURSE.
OF COURSE.

19:40.667 --> 19:43.000
IT'S JUST
SO FUNNY. OK. OK.

19:47.166 --> 19:48.166
OK, OK, OK.

19:48.166 --> 19:50.125
HEY, BREAK IT UP.
HEY, GUYS.

19:51.041 --> 19:52.166
THAT'S HOW
YOU WIN MY HEART?

19:52.166 --> 19:53.834
BY TRYING TO GIVE
THE GUY A WEDGIE?

19:53.834 --> 19:54.583
IT'S CALLED
THE KRAV MAGA,

19:54.583 --> 19:56.792
AND J.LO USED IT
IN ENOUGH.

19:56.792 --> 19:58.458
HEY, IT'S PATTY
FROM THE BLOCK.

19:58.458 --> 20:01.291
(CROWD LAUGHS)

20:01.291 --> 20:02.625
YOU WALKED RIGHT
INTO THAT ONE, BUD.

20:02.625 --> 20:03.708
YEAH, THAT WASN'T
EVEN FUNNY, BUDDY.

20:03.708 --> 20:04.708
OK. COME ON.

20:04.708 --> 20:05.708
YOUR GIRLFRIEND
LIKED IT.

20:05.708 --> 20:07.542
OH, YEAH?!

20:07.542 --> 20:09.125
ALL RIGHT!

20:14.208 --> 20:16.542
LOOK AT ME!
I LOOK COMPLETELY HIDEOUS.

20:16.542 --> 20:18.208
NO, YOU DON'T.

20:18.208 --> 20:19.583
YOU LOOK LIKE
A ROCK STAR.
ARE YOU KIDDING?

20:19.583 --> 20:21.667
YOU HAVE THE WHOLE
SMOKY EYE
LOOK GOING.

20:21.667 --> 20:24.208
WHERE'S HE WHOSE NAME
SHALL NOT BE SPOKEN?

20:24.208 --> 20:25.834
OH, HE'S IN
THE BOY'S BATHROOM
WITH PACEY,

20:25.834 --> 20:27.542
GETTING CLEANED UP.
SORT OF.

20:27.542 --> 20:29.667
DID HE ASK
ABOUT ME?
I WAS THERE BRIEFLY.

20:29.667 --> 20:30.708
WAS HE WITH
OTHER GIRLS?

20:30.708 --> 20:33.208
IT WAS THE
BOY'S BATHROOM.

20:33.208 --> 20:34.333
WHICH IS WHERE
WE HAD OUR FIRST KISS.

20:34.333 --> 20:35.583
HELLO?

20:35.583 --> 20:37.708
I'M ALL FOR THE GRAND
ROMANTIC GESTURE,

20:37.708 --> 20:40.542
BUT NEXT TIME,
INSTEAD OF FLAILING
AROUND WILDLY,

20:40.542 --> 20:42.875
WHY DON'T YOU
JUST TELL HER
THAT YOU LIKE HER?

20:42.875 --> 20:44.083
AND THEN, IF YOU
STILL FEEL THE NEED

20:44.083 --> 20:45.250
FOR THROWING
A PUNCH AFTERWARDS,

20:45.250 --> 20:46.542
PICK AN ENEMY
YOUR OWN SIZE.

20:46.542 --> 20:47.959
LIKE AN OPOSSUM.

20:47.959 --> 20:50.333
OH, YEAH. YEAH.
LIKE YOU'RE THE ROCK,
OR SOMETHING.

20:50.333 --> 20:53.250
HEY, HOBBIT,
AT LEAST I CAN
GROW FACIAL HAIR.

20:53.250 --> 20:55.458
WHAT DO
YOU CALL THIS?
LINT.

20:55.458 --> 20:57.291
Harley: LOOK AT ME!

20:57.291 --> 20:59.750
I'M CRYING
IN THE BATHROOM.

20:59.750 --> 21:02.250
AND THUS CARRYING ON
AN AGE-OLD TRADITION

21:02.250 --> 21:04.417
OF WOMEN CRYING
IN THE BATHROOM.

21:04.417 --> 21:05.959
I DID IT IN HIGH SCHOOL.

21:05.959 --> 21:07.834
LISTEN, JOEY, I DON'T
WANNA HURT YOUR FEELINGS,

21:07.834 --> 21:10.750
BUT MY HIGH SCHOOL
EXPERIENCES SHOULDN'T
REALLY BE THE SAME AS YOURS,

21:10.750 --> 21:13.667
OR I'M DOING SOMETHING
TERRIBLY, TERRIBLY WRONG.

21:13.667 --> 21:15.583
SORRY, KIDDO.

21:15.583 --> 21:18.083
BUT THAT'S JUST
HOW IT GOES WITH
THE HIGH SCHOOL DANCE.

21:18.083 --> 21:20.208
YOU BUY THE DRESS,
YOU MESS WITH THE HAIR,

21:20.208 --> 21:21.291
YOU POSE
FOR THE PICTURE,

21:21.291 --> 21:23.333
YOU THINK YOUR DATE
IS FINALLY GONNA SAY

21:23.333 --> 21:24.417
ALL THE THINGS
YOU'VE BEEN DYING
FOR HIM TO SAY,

21:24.417 --> 21:26.041
AND NO.

21:26.041 --> 21:29.250
INEVITABLY,
YOU END UP IN THE
GIRL'S BATHROOM CRYING.

21:29.250 --> 21:30.625
LOOK, YOU LIKE
HARLEY, RIGHT?

21:30.625 --> 21:32.041
SHE HAS HER
STRONG POINTS.

21:33.333 --> 21:34.792
OK.

21:34.792 --> 21:36.417
I MEAN, AS LONG AS
WE'RE TALKING MAN TO MAN,

21:36.417 --> 21:38.458
YEAH, I LIKE HER.

21:38.458 --> 21:39.458
A LOT.

21:39.458 --> 21:40.542
WELL, GOOD.
CONGRATULATIONS, MAN.

21:40.542 --> 21:42.583
'CAUSE TRUE FEELINGS
FOR A WOMAN,

21:42.583 --> 21:44.458
THAT'S ABOUT
THE BEST EXPERIENCE
YOU'RE EVER GONNA HAVE.

21:44.458 --> 21:46.792
I MEAN, IT'LL
MAKE YOU STRONG,
IT'LL MAKE YOU STUPID,

21:46.792 --> 21:50.750
AND IT WILL DEFINITELY
TAKE YOU CLOSER TO BEING
THE MAN YOU WANT TO BE.

21:50.750 --> 21:52.417
WHAT DO BOYS HAVE
TO SUFFER THROUGH?

21:52.417 --> 21:54.291
THINKING THEY'RE GONNA
HAVE SEX AFTERWARDS

21:54.291 --> 21:56.125
AND BEING
SORELY DISAPPOINTED.

21:56.125 --> 21:58.166
WELL...

21:58.166 --> 22:00.291
DON'T EVEN
THINK ABOUT IT.

22:00.291 --> 22:02.125
I KNOW! RELAX.

22:03.667 --> 22:05.125
DON'T BE AFRAID
TO BE NICE TO HER.

22:05.125 --> 22:08.125
OH. SO, BY NICE
TO HER, YOU MEAN...

22:08.125 --> 22:10.125
I MEAN TELL HER THAT
YOU LIKE HER SHOES.

22:10.125 --> 22:11.625
OH, AND HER, UH--

22:11.625 --> 22:13.333
TELL HER THAT
YOU LIKE HER,  IDIOT.

22:13.333 --> 22:16.208
OW. HEY.

22:17.041 --> 22:18.083
DON'T PUSH ME.

22:18.083 --> 22:21.000
OH, YEAH?
LET'S SEE WHAT'S UP!

22:21.000 --> 22:22.667
SO, YOU'VE HONESTLY
HAD A BAD TIME

22:22.667 --> 22:24.834
AT EVERY DANCE
YOU'VE GONE TO?

22:25.792 --> 22:27.208
YEAH.

22:29.000 --> 22:30.000
EXCEPT THIS ONE.

22:30.000 --> 22:32.834
THIS ONE WAS...

22:32.834 --> 22:34.708
NICE.

22:36.208 --> 22:39.125
WELL, I'M GLAD
SOMEONE HAD A GOOD TIME.

22:43.000 --> 22:44.166
HELLO?

22:46.000 --> 22:47.333
EVERYTHING OK?

22:47.333 --> 22:48.667
YEAH, FINE.

22:48.667 --> 22:50.166
YEAH, EVERYTHING'S
GOOD IN HERE.

22:50.166 --> 22:52.291
JUST CHECKING.

22:54.458 --> 22:57.417
YEAH, I DON'T KNOW
WHY I SHOULD BE TAKING
ADVICE FROM YOU.

22:57.417 --> 22:59.834
LIKE YOU'RE SOME
KIND OF YODA WHEN
IT COMES TO THE CHICKS.

22:59.834 --> 23:02.041
HAVE YOU SEEN MY DATE?

23:04.834 --> 23:07.083
TELL ME MORE, SENSEI.

23:09.708 --> 23:11.333
THAT WAS FOR YOU.

23:11.333 --> 23:12.333
YES?

23:12.333 --> 23:13.375
THE PHONE.

23:13.375 --> 23:15.041
YES?

23:15.041 --> 23:18.542
UM...DR. LOOMIS'
OFFICE

23:18.542 --> 23:21.333
CALLING TO CONFIRM
YOUR APPOINTMENT
TOMORROW AT 12:30.

23:26.041 --> 23:27.542
DR. LOOMIS ISN'T
YOUR REGULAR DOCTOR.

23:27.542 --> 23:29.166
HOW COME I'VE NEVER
HEARD HIS NAME BEFORE?

23:31.875 --> 23:34.208
ALL RIGHT. SOMETHING
IS GOING ON WITH YOU,

23:34.208 --> 23:37.542
AND I DEMAND TO KNOW
WHAT IT IS.

23:37.542 --> 23:39.917
JENNIFER, IF YOU
ARE LOOKING FOR
MYSTERY OR DRAMA,

23:39.917 --> 23:41.875
YOU'D BEST TAKE
YOUR SEARCH ELSEWHERE.

23:41.875 --> 23:45.250
I'M SORRY. I'M NOT
GOING TO LET YOU
KEEP THIS SECRET.

23:45.250 --> 23:47.417
I'VE LIVED WITH YOU
FOR 5 YEARS,

23:47.417 --> 23:49.542
AND EVERY TIME THAT
I'VE TRIED TO MOPE
MY WAY AROUND THE HOUSE,

23:49.542 --> 23:52.208
YOU'VE INSISTED
THAT I COME CLEAN
FOR THE COMMON GOOD.

23:53.917 --> 23:55.417
SO...

23:55.417 --> 23:57.291
NOW IT'S YOUR TURN.

24:00.250 --> 24:01.250
ALL RIGHT.

24:05.542 --> 24:09.875
DR. LOOMIS
IS AN ONCOLOGIST.

24:09.875 --> 24:11.417
I AM SEEING HER

24:11.417 --> 24:13.708
BECAUSE THERE IS
A MALIGNANT TUMOR
IN MY BREAST.

24:13.708 --> 24:17.291
I WILL BE STARTING
A ROUND OF RADIATION
THERAPY NEXT WEEK

24:17.291 --> 24:18.667
BECAUSE THE GROWTH
HAS SPREAD

24:18.667 --> 24:22.125
BEYOND THE POINT WHERE
SURGERY WOULD BE EFFECTIVE.

24:33.750 --> 24:35.166
ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT
BREAST CANCER?

24:35.166 --> 24:36.333
YES.

24:39.250 --> 24:41.583
OH, MY GOD.

24:41.583 --> 24:43.625
YES.

24:43.625 --> 24:46.166
WOULD YOU BE A DEAR?

24:46.166 --> 24:47.792
GO TURN THE OVEN DOWN.

24:47.792 --> 24:50.417
I DON'T WANT
THE CRUST TO BURN.

24:52.125 --> 24:54.250
JENNIFER, I TOLD YOU
WHAT IT IS.

24:54.250 --> 24:57.041
NOW PLEASE, JUST GO.

25:00.792 --> 25:03.125
VERY WELL.
I'LL DO IT MYSELF.

25:19.166 --> 25:20.083
HEY.

25:23.500 --> 25:24.792
OOH.

25:24.792 --> 25:25.875
YEAH, I KNOW.
KIDS TODAY, HUH?

25:25.875 --> 25:27.250
THAT DAMN RAP MUSIC.

25:27.250 --> 25:29.667
AND THOSE BAGGY PANTS.

25:29.667 --> 25:31.542
EVEN WITH THE DAMAGE
TO MY UNSUSPECTING
EARDRUM,

25:31.542 --> 25:33.667
I DID THINK THAT
TONIGHT WAS QUITE NICE.

25:33.667 --> 25:35.166
QUITE NICE.

25:35.166 --> 25:36.500
YES. QUITE.

25:36.500 --> 25:38.500
PERFECT. IT WAS...

25:38.500 --> 25:40.375
IT'S BEEN A PERFECT NIGHT.

25:43.291 --> 25:44.208
PACE?

25:46.125 --> 25:48.041
I CAN'T DO THIS.

25:50.166 --> 25:52.417
YOU CAN'T DO WHAT?

25:52.417 --> 25:55.542
EVEN WHEN EVERYTHING
IS PERFECT,

25:55.542 --> 25:58.792
BEING WITH YOU
DOESN'T FEEL RIGHT,

25:58.792 --> 26:01.583
AND I'M SORRY.

26:01.583 --> 26:03.417
LOOK, EVERYTHING TONIGHT--

26:03.417 --> 26:07.542
I MEAN, TONIGHT
WAS LOVELY AND FUN AND...

26:07.542 --> 26:09.375
YOU'VE BECOME THIS...

26:09.375 --> 26:12.208
I MEAN, THIS AMAZING MAN,

26:12.208 --> 26:14.041
BUT IT DOESN'T...

26:14.041 --> 26:17.875
I'M SORRY. I DON'T...

26:17.875 --> 26:19.542
I DON'T FEEL IT.

26:21.291 --> 26:24.333
AND I CAN'T DO THIS
WITH YOU.

26:24.333 --> 26:26.041
OK, JOEY, JUST
SLOW DOWN FOR A SECOND.

26:26.041 --> 26:27.458
NO, PACE, IT'S...

26:27.458 --> 26:30.750
IT'S TRUE AND...

26:30.750 --> 26:32.917
I'M SORRY.

26:32.917 --> 26:35.542
SO WHAT,
YOU'RE SCARED.

26:35.542 --> 26:36.917
RIGHT? YOU'RE SCARED.

26:36.917 --> 26:38.625
AND SO AM I,
BELIEVE ME.

26:38.625 --> 26:39.917
AND I'M SCARED BECAUSE

26:39.917 --> 26:42.250
I DON'T KNOW WHERE
THIS THING IS GOING, JO.

26:42.250 --> 26:45.792
AS IN, I THINK
IT COULD GO ANYWHERE.

26:45.792 --> 26:47.250
THIS COULD BE IT.

26:47.250 --> 26:49.333
IT WON'T BE.

26:49.333 --> 26:53.291
HOW COULD YOU
POSSIBLY KNOW THAT?

26:53.291 --> 26:55.250
I MEAN, REALLY. LAST
WEEK, YOU'RE ON BOARD,

26:55.250 --> 26:56.542
AND NOW YOU'RE JUST
PSYCHICALLY TELLING ME

26:56.542 --> 26:58.208
THAT THIS COULD NEVER
BE SOMETHING GREAT.

26:58.208 --> 26:59.708
YOU CAN'T POSSIBLY
KNOW THAT,

26:59.708 --> 27:01.959
BECAUSE WE DON'T
KNOW THAT, JOEY.

27:01.959 --> 27:03.542
AND I'M SORRY.

27:03.542 --> 27:05.834
I KNOW THAT THIS
IS SUCH A HORRIBLE
THING TO SAY.

27:05.834 --> 27:07.750
BUT HOW?

27:07.750 --> 27:09.291
HOW COULD YOU KNOW?

27:09.291 --> 27:11.458
AND WHEN DID YOU
MAKE THIS DECISION,
TONIGHT?

27:11.458 --> 27:12.667
I MEAN, I THOUGHT
TONIGHT WAS GOING GREAT.

27:12.667 --> 27:14.250
IT WAS.
IT WAS GREAT.

27:14.250 --> 27:16.166
SO THEN WHEN?

27:16.166 --> 27:17.291
AND DON'T TELL ME
THAT YOU'RE NOT SCARED,

27:17.291 --> 27:19.291
BECAUSE I KNOW
THAT YOU ARE.

27:19.291 --> 27:20.458
I MEAN, I'VE KNOWN YOU
TOO LONG

27:20.458 --> 27:23.417
AND SEEN YOU PUSH AWAY
TOO MANY GOOD THINGS

27:23.417 --> 27:26.250
TO LET YOU
PUSH ME AWAY RIGHT NOW.

27:26.250 --> 27:28.750
MY WHOLE LIFE, JOEY,
MY WHOLE LIFE

27:28.750 --> 27:32.250
YOU HAVE BEEN
THE MOST BEAUTIFUL THING
IN MY ORBIT.

27:32.250 --> 27:35.667
AND MY FEELINGS FOR YOU
WERE WHAT PROVED TO ME

27:35.667 --> 27:38.250
THAT I COULD BE GREAT.

27:38.250 --> 27:41.333
AND THOSE FEELINGS
WERE STRONGER
AND WERE WISER

27:41.333 --> 27:43.417
AND MORE PERSISTENT
AND MORE RESILIENT

27:43.417 --> 27:45.125
THAN ANYTHING ELSE
ABOUT ME.

27:45.125 --> 27:46.750
PACEY, STOP.
JO--

27:46.750 --> 27:48.291
PACEY!
WHEN I WAS AFRAID
OF EVERYTHING,

27:48.291 --> 27:49.500
I WAS NEVER AFRAID
TO LOVE YOU,

27:49.500 --> 27:52.000
AND I COULD LOVE YOU
AGAIN. I COULD.

27:52.000 --> 27:54.250
PACEY, NO. PACEY, STOP!

27:56.041 --> 27:58.625
EDDIE CAME BACK.

28:02.375 --> 28:05.000
I'M SORRY.
HE CAME BACK LAST NIGHT.

28:05.000 --> 28:06.166
HE CAME TO THE BAR--

28:06.166 --> 28:08.333
OH.

28:08.333 --> 28:10.000
OK.

28:10.000 --> 28:12.667
LOOK, I'M SORRY--

28:52.208 --> 28:53.542
HEY. I BROUGHT YOU
SOME COFFEE

28:53.542 --> 28:55.333
SINCE YOU'RE BURNING
THE MIDNIGHT OIL,

28:55.333 --> 28:56.542
AND A TURKEY SANDWICH.

28:56.542 --> 28:57.542
PROTEIN.

28:57.542 --> 28:59.250
THANKS, MOM.

28:59.250 --> 29:02.417
AH, YOUR EARLY WORK.

29:02.417 --> 29:04.792
YOU REALLY ARE
FEELING NOSTALGIC.

29:04.792 --> 29:07.083
AH, WELL...

29:07.083 --> 29:09.166
I DON'T KNOW.

29:09.166 --> 29:10.375
IN THOSE DAYS
IT WASN'T JUST ME ALONE

29:10.375 --> 29:11.834
IN FRONT OF
A COMPUTER SCREEN, YOU KNOW?

29:11.834 --> 29:14.375
I MEAN, I HAD PEOPLE
PITCHING IN.

29:14.375 --> 29:15.750
I HAD A WHOLE
SUPPORT SYSTEM.

29:15.750 --> 29:17.041
(TURNS OFF TELEVISION)

29:18.458 --> 29:20.458
SO HOW IS
YOUR SCRIPT COMING?

29:20.458 --> 29:22.208
GREAT.

29:22.208 --> 29:25.000
GREAT. IT'S, UH...

29:26.583 --> 29:27.750
WELL, ACTUALLY,
YOU KNOW WHAT?

29:27.750 --> 29:30.917
IT'S NOT SO GREAT
RIGHT NOW.

29:30.917 --> 29:33.041
LOOK, MOM, THERE'S SOMETHING
I'VE GOT TO TELL YOU.

29:34.583 --> 29:37.625
UM...

29:37.625 --> 29:40.750
I DON'T HAVE
A BACK-UP PLAN...

29:40.750 --> 29:42.500
AND I WON'T EVER HAVE ONE.

29:44.583 --> 29:46.250
I'M GOING TO BE A DIRECTOR,

29:46.250 --> 29:48.625
AND I DON'T WANT TO HAVE
ANYTHING TO FALL BACK ON,

29:48.625 --> 29:50.750
BECAUSE THERE'S NOTHING ELSE
THAT I WANT TO DO.

29:50.750 --> 29:52.875
IT'S NOT ALWAYS ABOUT
WHAT YOU WANT.

29:52.875 --> 29:54.917
DAWSON, YOU GROW UP,

29:54.917 --> 29:56.000
AND LIFE ISN'T WHAT
YOU THOUGHT IT WAS
GOING TO BE LIKE

29:56.000 --> 29:57.000
WHEN YOU WERE A KID.

29:57.000 --> 29:59.333
I AGREE.

29:59.333 --> 30:02.417
AND YOU'RE RIGHT,
BEING A DIRECTOR
IS A CHILD'S DREAM,

30:02.417 --> 30:04.792
AND THAT'S HOW I KNOW
THAT IT'S REAL.

30:04.792 --> 30:06.166
BECAUSE IT'S WHAT
I WANTED TO DO

30:06.166 --> 30:08.125
BEFORE I KNEW HOW
TO BE SCARED OR CYNICAL.

30:08.125 --> 30:10.834
OK, HONEY,
WHAT ABOUT COLLEGE?

30:10.834 --> 30:12.792
AT LEAST GO BACK.
FINISH FILM SCHOOL

30:12.792 --> 30:14.792
TO MAKE SURE THAT
YOU'RE COMMITTED
TO THIS THING.

30:14.792 --> 30:17.792
MOM, PLEASE.
IF A YEAR OF FETCHING LATTES

30:17.792 --> 30:19.375
AND CAJOLING ACTRESSES
OUT OF THEIR TRAILER

30:19.375 --> 30:20.959
TO ACT IN FRONT
OF A GREEN SCREEN

30:20.959 --> 30:22.458
DIDN'T KILL MY DESIRE
TO MAKE MOVIES,
NOTHING WILL.

30:22.458 --> 30:24.000
I KNOW THAT.

30:24.000 --> 30:27.125
AND I DON'T NEED TO SPEND
$60,000 OF THIS FAMILY'S MONEY

30:27.125 --> 30:28.959
TO FIGURE THAT OUT.

30:28.959 --> 30:31.542
I MEAN, MAKING MOVIES IS...

30:33.792 --> 30:35.333
IT'S MY LIFE.

30:35.333 --> 30:37.792
AND I NEED YOU TO BELIEVE

30:37.792 --> 30:41.041
THAT I'M THAT
ONE IN A MILLION
WHO'S GOING TO MAKE IT,

30:41.041 --> 30:43.375
BECAUSE I DO.

30:46.000 --> 30:48.500
HONEY, DID I
EVER TELL YOU THE STORY

30:48.500 --> 30:50.125
ABOUT THE TIME

30:50.125 --> 30:52.500
YOUR FATHER DECIDED
TO MAKE CHEWING GUM

30:52.500 --> 30:54.041
ON OUR KITCHEN STOVE?

30:54.041 --> 30:56.000
PLEASE TELL ME
YOU'RE KIDDING.

30:56.000 --> 30:58.166
MM-MMM. NO. HE WAS
GOING TO SELL IT
TO LOCAL GIFT SHOPS.

30:58.166 --> 31:00.625
AND I WON'T GET INTO
ANYTHING BEYOND THE FACT

31:00.625 --> 31:02.834
THAT IT WAS
A STICKY MESS

31:02.834 --> 31:04.708
AND WE HAD TO SHAVE
PART OF YOUR HEAD

31:04.708 --> 31:06.667
ONCE DAD DECIDED
TO MAKE YOU SOUS-CHEF

31:06.667 --> 31:07.959
OF THE STRAWBERRY
DIVISION.

31:07.959 --> 31:09.166
YOU SHAVED MY HEAD?

31:09.166 --> 31:10.917
PART OF YOUR HEAD.
YOU WERE 5.

31:10.917 --> 31:13.375
IT WAS THE EIGHTIES.
WE TOLD YOU IT WAS PUNK.

31:13.375 --> 31:15.458
THAT'S GREAT.

31:15.458 --> 31:17.000
ANYWAY, I'M JUST...

31:17.000 --> 31:19.166
WELL, I'M
BRINGING IT UP BECAUSE

31:19.166 --> 31:20.917
YOUR DAD HAD A LOT
OF HAREBRAINED SCHEMES,

31:20.917 --> 31:23.083
AND I WAS ALWAYS CONVINCED
THAT THE GUM ONE

31:23.083 --> 31:25.875
WAS BASED ON CHARLIE
AND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY,

31:25.875 --> 31:28.083
WHICH WAS HIS FAVORITE BOOK
AS A CHILD.

31:28.083 --> 31:30.667
BUT HE WOULDN'T
ADMIT IT.

31:34.041 --> 31:35.875
OK, THIS ONE'S
A LITTLE MORE SUBTLE

31:35.875 --> 31:37.417
THAN SOME OF
YOUR OTHER LIFE LESSONS.

31:37.417 --> 31:39.333
DAWSON...

31:39.333 --> 31:41.542
YOUR DAD'S
PIPE DREAMING,

31:41.542 --> 31:44.375
IT DROVE ME
RIGHT UP THE WALL.

31:44.375 --> 31:45.750
BUT IT WAS ALSO
ONE OF THE THINGS

31:45.750 --> 31:48.083
THAT MADE ME
FALL IN LOVE WITH HIM.

31:48.083 --> 31:51.208
BECAUSE, LIKE YOU,

31:51.208 --> 31:53.917
HE HAD THE COURAGE
TO BELIEVE

31:53.917 --> 31:56.000
THAT LIFE COULD BE
AS GREAT AS YOU THINK
IT COULD BE

31:56.000 --> 31:57.375
WHEN YOU'RE A KID.

32:00.083 --> 32:02.959
SO YOU GET
WHAT I'M SAYING?

32:09.125 --> 32:10.875
WOULD YOU LIKE ME
TO WATCH LILY FOR YOU?

32:10.875 --> 32:12.250
YEAH.

32:12.250 --> 32:15.208
AND THEN GO
JUMP OFF THE CLIFF.

32:15.208 --> 32:16.583
ONLY METAPHORICALLY,
OF COURSE.

32:16.583 --> 32:17.667
MOM...

32:17.667 --> 32:19.792
I'M YOUR MOTHER.
I CAN'T HELP IT.

32:21.417 --> 32:23.458
OOH.

32:23.458 --> 32:25.542
APPARENTLY...

32:25.542 --> 32:27.208
YOU LIKED
MY LITTLE METAPHOR

32:27.208 --> 32:28.583
ABOUT THINGS
THAT FADE.

32:28.583 --> 32:29.625
ACTUALLY, I JUST THOUGHT
IT WAS COOL

32:29.625 --> 32:31.250
THAT THERE WERE
PEOPLE IN THIS WORLD

32:31.250 --> 32:33.542
WHO WOULD GIVE YOU
THE PRIZE OUT OF
THEIR CRACKER JACK BOX.

32:37.792 --> 32:39.708
IT'S BECAUSE
I LOVE YOU, HONEY.

32:49.083 --> 32:50.375
HMM.

33:31.834 --> 33:34.750
OK. THERE IS NOTHING WRONG
WITH BEING SCARED.

33:36.625 --> 33:38.834
IT'S PERFECTLY NATURAL.

33:38.834 --> 33:41.792
BEING SCARED
DOES NO ONE ANY GOOD.

33:44.500 --> 33:45.667
OK.

33:45.667 --> 33:47.708
SO WHAT DO I DO
TO HELP?

33:47.708 --> 33:50.000
WELL, YOU CAN
FETCH ME THE BUTTER

33:50.000 --> 33:51.959
FROM THE TOP SHELF
OF THE REFRIGERATOR.

33:54.792 --> 33:57.166
I WASN'T REFERRING, UM...

33:57.166 --> 34:00.625
TO THIS CULINARY EXERCISE
IN DISPLACED ENERGIES.

34:00.625 --> 34:01.667
I MEAN YOU.

34:01.667 --> 34:04.542
I MEAN, WHAT DO I DO
TO HELP YOU?

34:09.333 --> 34:12.667
YOU'RE GOING TO NEED SOMEBODY
TO DRIVE YOU TO TREATMENTS,

34:12.667 --> 34:15.041
AND I CAN DO THAT.

34:15.041 --> 34:17.875
I CAN COOK MEALS
IN ADVANCE,

34:17.875 --> 34:22.166
TIVO 60 MINUTES,

34:22.166 --> 34:24.250
AND WHEN YOU GET BORED,

34:24.250 --> 34:26.291
JACK AND I
ARE GOING TO ACT OUT SCENES

34:26.291 --> 34:28.792
FROM MOULIN ROUGE
FOR YOU.

34:28.792 --> 34:30.542
JACK CAN HAVE NOTHING
TO DO WITH THIS,

34:30.542 --> 34:32.041
NOR CAN YOU, JENNIFER.

34:32.041 --> 34:35.833
THIS IS MY OWN
PERSONAL BUSINESS,

34:35.833 --> 34:38.875
AND I CAN
TAKE CARE OF IT MYSELF.

34:42.625 --> 34:44.000
WELL, WHAT ABOUT ME?

34:44.000 --> 34:46.875
I MEAN, WHO'S GOING
TO TAKE CARE OF ME?

34:46.875 --> 34:49.750
I MEAN, YOU'RE
MY GRANDMOTHER,

34:49.750 --> 34:51.208
THE PERSON I LOVE MOST
IN THE WORLD,

34:51.208 --> 34:53.750
AND YOU'RE SICK,
AND I'M THE ONE WHO'S SCARED.

34:53.750 --> 34:56.625
LOOK, JENNIFER,

34:56.625 --> 34:58.542
THIS IS NOT
A DEATH SENTENCE.

34:58.542 --> 35:00.750
NOW...

35:00.750 --> 35:02.875
MANY PEOPLE MY AGE,

35:02.875 --> 35:06.917
THEY HAVE ONE ROUND
OF RADIATION THERAPY

35:06.917 --> 35:11.417
AND THEY LIVE
LONG HAPPY LIVES
IN REMISSION.

35:13.875 --> 35:16.500
OK, SO LET'S TALK ABOUT THAT.

35:17.458 --> 35:18.542
HMM?

35:18.542 --> 35:19.917
OH, JENNIFER...

35:19.917 --> 35:21.959
BUT CAN WE AT LEAST
JUST START TALKING?

35:23.792 --> 35:25.250
JENNIFER...

35:25.250 --> 35:28.291
I AM NOT READY
TO DIE YET.

35:30.083 --> 35:31.708
COME HERE.

35:34.166 --> 35:36.333
DO YOU HEAR ME?

35:36.333 --> 35:37.542
HMM?

35:38.834 --> 35:40.542
DO YOU?

35:50.125 --> 35:53.583
AND AS MY FIST
WAS ROCKETING
TOWARDS HIS NECK,

35:53.583 --> 35:55.917
I WAS JUST, LIKE,
YOU KNOW, PATRICK,

35:55.917 --> 35:57.834
YOU'RE A LOVER,
NOT A FIGHTER.

35:57.834 --> 36:01.083
THAT LAST PART
WAS PRETTY OBVIOUS.

36:01.083 --> 36:03.667
AND AS FOR
THE FIRST PART...

36:03.667 --> 36:05.667
YOU MEAN THE LOVER PART?

36:05.667 --> 36:07.959
NOT A CHANCE.

36:07.959 --> 36:10.917
OH. WELL, I DIDN'T
MEAN IT LITERALLY.

36:12.667 --> 36:14.208
WELL, YEAH, I DID, BUT...

36:14.208 --> 36:17.333
YOU KNOW,
THAT'S NOT THE REASON
I'M AT THE DANCE WITH YOU.

36:17.333 --> 36:20.166
I'M AT THE DANCE WITH YOU
BECAUSE IF I WEREN'T,

36:20.166 --> 36:22.667
YOU'D BE WITH
SOME OTHER GUY,
AND THAT WOULD KILL ME.

36:22.667 --> 36:24.792
BECAUSE YOU LIKE ME?

36:24.792 --> 36:26.708
YEAH.

36:33.250 --> 36:34.542
NICE SPEECH.

36:34.542 --> 36:36.333
PACEY TEACH YOU THAT?

36:36.333 --> 36:40.542
YEAH. YEAH, THAT AND HOW
TO UNHOOK A BRA
WITH ONE HAND.

36:40.542 --> 36:43.500
TRY IT AND YOU'LL
HAVE ONE HAND LEFT.

37:03.250 --> 37:04.708
IF MEMORY SERVES,

37:04.708 --> 37:06.792
I OWE YOU A DANCE,
MS. POTTER.

39:32.041 --> 39:33.583
YOU'RE PROBABLY
WONDERING

39:33.583 --> 39:35.417
WHAT THE HELL
I'M DOING HERE.

40:00.667 --> 40:01.708
(CHUCKLES)

40:01.708 --> 40:03.250
HI.
HI.

40:03.250 --> 40:04.542
HI.
