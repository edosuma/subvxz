WEBVTT

00:14.599 --> 00:16.393
Vice president's on the line.

00:16.559 --> 00:19.979
Jim, I have reason to believe
the Cyprus audio was fabricated.

00:20.146 --> 00:22.148
I thought we proved it was real.

00:22.315 --> 00:26.903
CTU LA is in the process of obtaining
intelligence that may show otherwise.

00:27.070 --> 00:31.658
With all due respect,
it's too late for second thoughts.

00:31.825 --> 00:34.994
- Come out with your hands on your head.
- I killed a man.

00:35.161 --> 00:38.164
If you turn yourself in,
they'll consider that.

00:38.331 --> 00:41.960
If I see you coming in, I will kill her.

00:43.044 --> 00:45.505
Go, go, go.

00:45.672 --> 00:47.674
- He wasn't working alone.
- What?

00:47.841 --> 00:50.677
Baker was keeping an eye on Kate.
Michelle distracted him.

00:50.844 --> 00:53.930
- Did you help Jack take Kate Warner?
- Of course not.

00:54.097 --> 00:56.683
Put a filter on all
of Michelle's communications.

00:56.850 --> 00:58.935
Let me know when Jack tries to contact her.

00:59.102 --> 01:01.938
- What's going on?
- Ten minutes ago a man called me.

01:02.105 --> 01:06.693
Said he had proof the evidence the president
was basing his decisions on was forged.

01:06.860 --> 01:09.112
He'll give me more info
if I bring you to him.

01:09.279 --> 01:12.282
I got what you need. I won't give it to you
until you give me Kate.

01:12.449 --> 01:15.118
How does the evidence prove
the recording was forged?

01:15.285 --> 01:16.870
I have the source recordings.

01:17.036 --> 01:18.872
Why did you follow me from CTU?

01:19.038 --> 01:22.459
When you broke out, you isolated yourself.
You'll need help.

01:39.642 --> 01:43.271
They're coming at us
from both sides of the alley.

01:43.813 --> 01:46.483
The roof.

01:46.649 --> 01:49.360
Fire escape.

02:01.456 --> 02:03.249
Give me the keys.

02:03.416 --> 02:05.877
- Here.
- Yusuf, give me cover.

02:11.382 --> 02:14.969
Kate, get out of the trunk and stay down.

02:17.388 --> 02:21.059
- Left. On the left.
- Go for the door now.

02:49.379 --> 02:52.173
Kate, come with me.

02:53.550 --> 02:56.636
Get down. Stay down.

02:56.803 --> 02:59.973
- Who are these guys?
- Follow-up team sent by my employers.

03:00.139 --> 03:03.309
- Figured out they didn't get me.
- How'd they know you were here?

03:03.476 --> 03:05.562
Beats the hell out of me.

03:22.036 --> 03:25.164
- Jack, you there?
- Yusuf, are you OK?

03:25.331 --> 03:26.916
- Yeah.
- Where are you?

03:27.083 --> 03:29.502
I've managed to get
to the vehicle and rearm.

03:29.669 --> 03:32.338
- What's out there?
- Three down that I know of.

03:32.505 --> 03:36.843
There's three more. I don't have their
positions. I'll find a better vantage point.

03:37.010 --> 03:40.930
We'll figure out what we're gonna do
in here. I'll get back to you. Stand by.

03:41.097 --> 03:45.184
- Have him cover us. Let's get out of here.
- We don't know how many are out there.

03:45.351 --> 03:49.606
- I'll call my person at CTU. She can help.
- Negative. You're not calling anybody.

03:49.772 --> 03:54.986
The only way you get the proof Palmer needs
is if we do this my way. We go now.

03:56.487 --> 03:59.365
They're trying to kill us.
Doesn't it prove something?

03:59.532 --> 04:02.201
Not to the Joint Chiefs of Staff in DC.

04:02.368 --> 04:06.664
- Call Yusuf, let's shape an exit strategy.
- Jack.

04:08.416 --> 04:11.711
- Yusuf, go ahead.
- Sounds like another Humvee just arrived.

04:11.878 --> 04:13.963
Son of a bitch. Stand by.

04:14.130 --> 04:17.300
We're surrounded.
You've gotta let me make this call.

04:17.466 --> 04:21.137
I've got someone on the inside
that can give us infrared satellite.

04:21.303 --> 04:25.975
I guarantee you,
I will not jeopardize your identity.

04:26.142 --> 04:28.686
- Off line?
- Yes.

04:29.604 --> 04:31.689
Do it.

04:35.026 --> 04:37.487
- Dessler.
- It's Jack. Are we secure?

04:37.654 --> 04:41.491
My cell's scrambled, but don't call
on agency numbers. I'm being monitored.

04:41.658 --> 04:43.910
You were right, Ali's recording was fake.

04:44.077 --> 04:49.082
The president's about to invade the
Middle East based on falsified evidence.

04:49.248 --> 04:52.418
- Do you have proof?
- Not yet, but I can get it. I need your help.

04:52.585 --> 04:56.506
It'll be difficult. Tony's been breathing
down my neck since I helped you.

04:56.673 --> 05:00.677
- Work around it. I need infrared satellite.
- Where are you?

05:00.843 --> 05:04.347
- Get the coordinates off our connection.
- What are you looking for?

05:04.514 --> 05:07.600
We're surrounded.
There's three of us inside.

05:07.767 --> 05:09.852
I need to know how many men are outside.

05:10.019 --> 05:13.356
I got a friendly at the end of the alley,
behind the dumpster.

05:13.523 --> 05:15.817
- I'll see what I can do.
- Thanks.

05:16.901 --> 05:18.027
- Yusuf?
- I'm here.

05:18.194 --> 05:21.364
We're gonna be a few minutes.
We're waiting on satellite.

05:21.531 --> 05:24.534
It's gonna take a while.
We should secure our position.

05:24.701 --> 05:26.744
Come on.

05:29.497 --> 05:33.042
- Is Mr Garcia gonna be all right?
- He'll live.

05:34.502 --> 05:38.214
I'm gonna put down that you claim
the shooting was an accident.

05:38.381 --> 05:39.382
It was.

05:39.549 --> 05:45.722
He'll still have to explain to the DA what he
was doing going into the store with a gun.

05:55.773 --> 05:58.776
- It wasn't his.
- What's that?

05:59.569 --> 06:02.113
The gun, it was mine.

06:03.531 --> 06:05.867
What are you doing with a gun?

06:07.577 --> 06:10.747
Someone gave it to me earlier tonight.

06:13.583 --> 06:17.045
Look, my name's Kim Bauer.

06:19.756 --> 06:23.426
This afternoon,
I escaped from police custody.

06:23.593 --> 06:26.220
And I'm a suspect in a murder.

06:28.765 --> 06:31.934
While most Americans are asleep
and haven't heard the news

06:32.101 --> 06:36.606
about the nuclear detonation in California,
many are up and are starting to react.

06:36.773 --> 06:41.277
That reaction is taking many forms,
and in some cases violence is erupting.

06:41.444 --> 06:46.449
We're still awaiting a statement from
the White House on who is behind the attack.

06:46.616 --> 06:48.951
- That's enough.
- We hope...

06:49.118 --> 06:53.623
- The alert status of the National Guard?
- They're ready in metropolitan areas.

06:53.790 --> 06:58.711
- What about outside the big cities?
- We may have to get help from the military.

06:58.878 --> 07:02.298
Local law enforcement
might not be able to do the job.

07:02.465 --> 07:06.302
Call General Bowden,
tell him to put troops on standby.

07:06.469 --> 07:08.513
The army? We can't do that.

07:09.347 --> 07:11.974
- You're worried about posse comitatus.
- Exactly.

07:12.141 --> 07:15.812
We can't use army or air force
on American soil. Only navy and marines.

07:15.978 --> 07:20.691
No, the navy can't help us. And there are
not enough marines on standby.

07:22.485 --> 07:25.488
- I'll deal with the consequences. Call him.
- Yes, sir.

07:25.655 --> 07:29.242
- The status of our bombers?
- They're proceeding to their targets.

07:29.408 --> 07:31.577
- Where are they now?
- South of Greenland.

07:31.744 --> 07:34.997
They should enter Middle Eastern airspace
in four hours.

07:35.164 --> 07:37.542
Thank you.

07:45.049 --> 07:47.385
What are you doing on the satellite?

07:48.636 --> 07:52.348
Just checking on something.
Prepped the files for the next shift?

07:52.515 --> 07:54.809
Yeah, I'm almost done.

07:56.644 --> 07:59.355
I'm gonna go see if Tony needs some help.

08:15.913 --> 08:19.375
- What's up?
- You asked me to keep an eye on Michelle?

08:19.542 --> 08:23.462
- Yeah.
- She was accessing a mod-sat screen.

08:23.629 --> 08:26.382
That's not unusual.
We've been on mod-sat all night.

08:26.549 --> 08:29.635
She received a call
that wouldn't lock onto our log.

08:29.802 --> 08:32.221
- It was open?
- Yeah.

08:32.388 --> 08:35.600
- It might have been Division.
- It might have been.

08:39.352 --> 08:44.025
All right, find out what she
was looking at. Let me know.

09:14.305 --> 09:16.641
Yusuf, what's happening out there?

09:20.937 --> 09:23.022
I think they're repositioning.

09:23.189 --> 09:27.485
We're still waiting on satellite.
I'll get back to you.

09:36.786 --> 09:40.206
With CTU's help, we're gonna
get out of here, I promise.

09:40.373 --> 09:42.458
What does Wallace want with me?

09:42.625 --> 09:46.462
- He needs you to get out of the country.
- Needs me? How?

09:46.629 --> 09:52.301
With your father's CIA connections, his
company has a special travel dispensation.

09:53.636 --> 09:57.640
They wouldn't let him on board
as a passenger unless...

09:57.807 --> 10:00.309
I was on the plane with him.

10:00.476 --> 10:02.645
I know.

10:02.812 --> 10:04.855
Kate.

10:05.940 --> 10:08.693
I will not let you get on that plane.

11:03.372 --> 11:06.375
Is there any way I can find out
how my boyfriend is doing?

11:06.542 --> 11:09.545
I don't know about that.
Wait till we get to the station.

11:09.712 --> 11:12.882
There was also another officer.
His name was Brown.

11:13.049 --> 11:16.218
- He was in the accident as well.
- I don't know him either.

11:16.385 --> 11:21.390
Look, miss, you're under arrest.

11:21.557 --> 11:25.144
So, take my advice, don't say any more.

11:25.311 --> 11:27.563
It doesn't matter anyway.

11:28.606 --> 11:31.233
You can make a phone call at the station.

11:31.400 --> 11:33.611
Who am I gonna call?

11:34.403 --> 11:39.450
My dad was the one who was flying
the plane, the one with the bomb in it.

11:40.076 --> 11:42.620
I don't have anyone anymore.

12:07.645 --> 12:09.688
- Almeida.
- She's looking at infrareds.

12:09.855 --> 12:12.024
She's been collecting data.

12:12.191 --> 12:17.530
Pull coordinates off what she's looking at.
If it's for Jack, that's where we'll find him.

12:17.696 --> 12:20.282
- I tried that.
- What's the problem?

12:20.449 --> 12:23.452
She's covered her tracks.
She's pulled 100 quadrants.

12:23.619 --> 12:26.122
I have no idea which one she's interested in.

12:26.288 --> 12:30.835
I'll tell you what, I'll deal with this, Carrie.
All right? Thanks.

12:49.186 --> 12:52.481
- Yeah?
- I don't have a lot of time. Are you ready?

12:52.648 --> 12:54.859
Give me one sec.

12:57.111 --> 13:00.156
- OK, I'm ready.
- I count 11, including your friendly.

13:00.322 --> 13:03.159
I'm sending you their positions
on an infrared map.

13:03.325 --> 13:07.496
They're all stationary except for one.
Jack, he's roving.

13:07.663 --> 13:10.875
- OK, send it.
- OK.

13:14.211 --> 13:16.255
- You got it?
- Yeah, I got it.

13:16.422 --> 13:19.175
How much longer do you need
to stay anonymous?

13:19.341 --> 13:23.512
- I don't know, why?
- Tony's watching me. Gotta go.

13:23.679 --> 13:26.390
- How are you holding up?
- All right.

13:27.016 --> 13:30.352
- I've got so much to do.
- I know.

13:34.690 --> 13:38.194
You always take a phone
with you to the bathroom?

13:38.360 --> 13:41.864
- Where's Jack?
- I don't know.

13:42.031 --> 13:45.951
We've been monitoring all communication
coming in and out all day.

13:46.118 --> 13:49.455
- If you're breaking protocol...
- I'm not.

13:49.622 --> 13:53.709
All right, then I'll ask you again.

13:53.876 --> 13:57.588
- Where's Jack?
- I don't know.

13:58.714 --> 14:00.716
But you have to call President Palmer.

14:00.883 --> 14:06.222
Tell him not to act on the recording
until Jack finishes the investigation.

14:06.388 --> 14:09.433
- So you have talked to Jack?
- I didn't say that.

14:11.185 --> 14:12.811
Listen carefully, Michelle.

14:12.978 --> 14:16.065
- You don't work for Jack, you work for me.
- Get past your ego...

14:16.232 --> 14:19.652
Ego? You don't like the way
I'm doing my job, that's your problem.

14:19.818 --> 14:24.782
But if you know anything about Jack Bauer,
you'd better tell me about it right now.

14:26.075 --> 14:30.788
I have no information. I'm not helping Jack.

14:38.963 --> 14:41.590
I hope you're not lying to me.

14:49.932 --> 14:52.101
She counted nine, plus one roving.

14:52.268 --> 14:55.688
If I was a sniper,
I'd cover the building from here.

14:55.854 --> 14:58.691
- Yeah, looks right.
- We'll have to build a corridor.

14:58.857 --> 15:02.194
- Which exit?
- This one right here.

15:02.361 --> 15:06.865
Go between here, let 'em fire at each other.
It'll give us ten seconds to get to the car.

15:07.032 --> 15:09.785
With just us firing?

15:10.494 --> 15:12.580
We don't have another way.

15:22.798 --> 15:25.301
Jack, I know how to shoot a gun.

15:31.765 --> 15:35.769
Take this. You stay right behind me.

15:38.689 --> 15:41.066
- Yusuf, this is Jack, do you copy?
- Yeah.

15:41.233 --> 15:43.235
We're getting ready to make our exit.

15:43.402 --> 15:45.821
- Let me give you positions.
- Go ahead.

15:45.988 --> 15:47.990
We've counted nine, plus one roving.

15:48.157 --> 15:53.370
We got two shooters on the balcony right
above me. Three in the building adjacent.

15:54.204 --> 15:56.665
I just got off with the secretary of defense.

15:56.832 --> 16:00.836
He wants to know how much longer
you'll give Jack Bauer to disprove that tape

16:01.003 --> 16:02.588
before we fail-safe the orders.

16:02.755 --> 16:07.259
Jack Bauer will have up until the time
the planes start releasing bombs.

16:07.426 --> 16:11.347
From the secretary's point of view,
that's tying the DOD's hands.

16:11.513 --> 16:15.017
The longer it takes for your decision,
the less flexibility he has,

16:15.184 --> 16:17.186
and he may want to launch a prestrike...

16:17.353 --> 16:20.689
There will be no prestrikes on this mission.

16:20.856 --> 16:24.860
We're gonna utilize every moment
we have to be thorough.

16:25.027 --> 16:27.279
- He won't like that.
- That's his problem.

16:27.446 --> 16:28.364
I understand.

16:28.530 --> 16:32.368
Sir, there's a situation
that requires your immediate attention.

16:32.534 --> 16:33.619
What, Mike?

16:33.786 --> 16:37.039
Civil unrest is starting
to tip up and down the East Coast.

16:37.206 --> 16:40.876
The area I'm most concerned about
is outside of Atlanta.

16:41.043 --> 16:42.378
What's going on there?

16:42.544 --> 16:44.963
Some ad hoc militias have joined forces

16:45.130 --> 16:48.509
and they're getting very aggressive
in one of the suburbs.

16:49.343 --> 16:51.387
- Is this racially motivated?
- Yes.

16:51.553 --> 16:56.058
The demographics of the area
are predominantly Middle Eastern.

16:56.225 --> 16:58.394
What do you hope to accomplish here?

16:58.560 --> 17:01.647
We want Washington to know
we consider ourselves at war.

17:01.814 --> 17:05.317
We want these people interned.
And if they won't do it, we will.

17:05.483 --> 17:09.488
Who do you want interned? Most people
in this neighborhood are US citizens.

17:09.655 --> 17:13.157
They weren't born here.
Some of them don't speak English.

17:13.325 --> 17:17.329
They memorize answers to 50 questions,
take the test, then we let them vote.

17:17.496 --> 17:19.915
How do you respond
to claims that these people

17:20.082 --> 17:22.917
have no more to do
with the bomb than you or I?

17:23.085 --> 17:27.714
If we'd locked down our borders 20 years ago,
none of this would have happened.

17:28.632 --> 17:32.761
What's eerie is, even though the crowd
has been here for half an hour,

17:32.928 --> 17:34.930
there are only a few police cars.

17:35.097 --> 17:39.351
Why? I thought we ordered
the National Guard.

17:39.518 --> 17:42.438
Some are on their way,
some are at other flash points.

17:42.604 --> 17:47.443
- Want me to call the FBI and the army?
- And tell them what?

17:47.609 --> 17:50.446
- They've had their orders.
- The problem is resources.

17:50.612 --> 17:53.532
We just don't have enough bodies
to cover everything.

17:53.699 --> 17:55.868
Where's the media heading right now?

17:56.034 --> 17:59.037
It's happening all up and down
the East Coast.

17:59.204 --> 18:04.835
But this city, Marietta in Atlanta, seems
to have the most traction with the press.

18:06.962 --> 18:10.215
All right. This is what we're gonna do.

18:10.382 --> 18:14.303
We may be short on manpower,
but it doesn't have to appear that way.

18:14.470 --> 18:18.056
Send all the Eastern Georgia
National Guard to Marietta.

18:18.223 --> 18:22.144
And tell the media that this is where
something's going to happen.

18:22.311 --> 18:24.772
What's going to happen, sir?

18:25.647 --> 18:28.317
If this is what the people
are going to be watching,

18:28.484 --> 18:31.069
let's show them
how we're going to respond.

18:31.236 --> 18:33.572
I want them to see
how we protect our citizens.

18:33.739 --> 18:37.159
We will not put up with
racism or xenophobia.

18:37.326 --> 18:41.330
If this is where it's gonna start,
this is where it's gonna stop.

19:09.733 --> 19:12.027
All right, I'm all set up here.

19:12.194 --> 19:14.863
Start laying down the smoke.
We're ready to go.

19:15.030 --> 19:18.158
Copy that. Go in on the smoke.

19:33.090 --> 19:36.969
You take the men on the left,
I got the ones right above us. You ready?

19:37.135 --> 19:41.098
Smoke's in place. I'll draw fire
and go pick up the vehicle.

19:46.186 --> 19:48.397
Go.

20:10.919 --> 20:13.422
- Kate.
- Jack.

20:13.589 --> 20:15.799
Kate, get down.

21:12.022 --> 21:15.609
Kate. Come on, we gotta keep going.

21:22.032 --> 21:24.868
Keep moving.

21:26.370 --> 21:28.956
Get in the front seat and stay down.

21:29.706 --> 21:32.042
Get down.

21:54.898 --> 21:58.819
Stay down. Go, go, go.

22:10.247 --> 22:12.582
Let me look at it.

22:17.045 --> 22:19.464
No exit wound.
We gotta get you to a hospital.

22:19.631 --> 22:23.969
- No. LAX, cargo departures.
- You will not make it.

22:24.136 --> 22:26.221
I'll make it. Just stop the bleeding.

22:26.388 --> 22:31.518
Kate, in the glove box, there's a first-aid kit.
Get me all the gauze, pads and wraps.

22:33.395 --> 22:36.106
Hold on, hold on.

22:37.441 --> 22:39.651
Put pressure on it now.

22:39.818 --> 22:41.653
It's a surreal scene in Marietta.

22:41.820 --> 22:44.906
It's 4:30am and normally people
would be at home, asleep.

22:45.073 --> 22:49.911
Yet today a showdown is in the making.
The riots have escalated all over the city.

22:50.078 --> 22:52.914
Fires and looting
are reported to be widespread.

22:53.081 --> 22:56.668
The National Guard continue to roll in,
as do the angry citizens,

22:56.835 --> 23:02.924
who are taking out their frustration on this
peaceful Middle Eastern community.

23:03.091 --> 23:06.261
You got what you asked for.
It's on all the news channels.

23:06.428 --> 23:10.932
Manski of the National Guard wants to know
what tactical rule-set you wanna follow.

23:11.099 --> 23:14.436
- What are they on now?
- Containment only.

23:14.603 --> 23:16.605
Unacceptable. I want the law enforced.

23:16.772 --> 23:19.608
Tell him to start making arrests
and taking people in.

23:19.775 --> 23:23.528
Sir, if you declare a curfew you can start
pulling every one of them in

23:23.695 --> 23:27.282
- before this thing gets out of control.
- That a good idea, do it.

23:27.449 --> 23:31.203
- Tell him we're not afraid to take action.
- Yes, sir.

23:31.369 --> 23:34.623
What will help more
than anything, sir, is your voice.

23:34.790 --> 23:38.251
You need to talk directly to the people.

23:39.669 --> 23:41.797
I know.

23:42.798 --> 23:45.634
Tell Jenny I'll be down in a few minutes.

23:47.677 --> 23:51.139
- Murphy speaking.
- This is Novick. I need Jenny Dodge.

23:54.267 --> 23:55.560
- Carrie.
- Yeah?

23:55.727 --> 23:58.897
LAPD said there was automatic-weapon fire
in Studio City.

23:59.064 --> 24:01.983
Police are finding bodies
and military-spec weapons.

24:02.150 --> 24:06.321
We got the address. Check it against
what Michelle pulled off the satellite.

24:06.488 --> 24:08.532
Right away.

24:09.366 --> 24:12.452
Is that the location, Michelle? Huh, is it?

24:13.370 --> 24:18.375
The police just got there,
they already got four bodies. So let's talk.

24:22.337 --> 24:26.258
- Yeah, that's it.
- We gotta call him. He may need our help.

24:26.424 --> 24:30.178
Jack made it clear that the only way
to get proof is if CTU stays out of it.

24:30.345 --> 24:33.890
We don't even know if he's still alive.

24:41.398 --> 24:46.486
He's on an open channel. You won't be able
to trace it, but you can talk to him.

24:49.406 --> 24:51.700
- Michelle.
- No, Jack, it's Tony.

24:51.867 --> 24:54.536
Tony, trust me, stay out of this.

24:54.703 --> 24:57.539
- What's going on?
- The president asked me for proof

24:57.706 --> 25:00.709
that the Cyprus recording was fake.
I'm trying to do that.

25:00.876 --> 25:06.131
The man who can provide proof will only
deal with me. He won't cooperate with CTU.

25:06.298 --> 25:09.634
- That's why I left in that way.
- How do we know he's not using you?

25:09.801 --> 25:13.805
Cos ten commandos tried to kill him
to stop him from making a deal with me.

25:13.972 --> 25:16.558
- What's he want?
- He wants to disappear.

25:16.725 --> 25:18.059
We'll deal with him here.

25:18.226 --> 25:21.646
He will not cooperate with us
under those circumstances.

25:21.813 --> 25:25.233
I understand, but this country's
about to go to war over this.

25:25.400 --> 25:28.153
This is too big for one person
to handle. Even you.

25:28.320 --> 25:30.572
Keep going straight.

25:30.739 --> 25:33.283
Sorry, I can't do it.

25:44.711 --> 25:46.963
He's still bleeding bad.

25:51.468 --> 25:53.511
Bobby.

25:53.678 --> 25:56.181
Is this Kim Bauer?

25:56.348 --> 25:59.267
- I'll take her.
- What about processing her?

25:59.434 --> 26:02.062
It's OK. Go fill out the report.

26:08.151 --> 26:10.612
Come with me.

26:10.779 --> 26:12.948
We'll go in here.

26:22.499 --> 26:24.793
Have a seat.

26:40.642 --> 26:42.644
Looks like you've had quite a day.

26:42.811 --> 26:46.648
- Yeah.
- You took Megan Matheson from her home.

26:46.815 --> 26:50.986
- She was being abused.
- Got into a fight with her father.

26:51.152 --> 26:54.656
Then, you took Megan again,
this time from the hospital.

26:54.823 --> 26:59.160
- You stole Gary's car and fled the city.
- I had to. I knew about the bomb.

26:59.327 --> 27:04.332
Understood. But then you were stopped
by CHP Officer Raymond Brown,

27:04.499 --> 27:06.501
who discovered the dead body of Carla.

27:06.668 --> 27:09.587
- I didn't kill anyone.
- I know you didn't.

27:09.754 --> 27:12.590
We know Gary killed his wife.
We're looking for him.

27:12.757 --> 27:16.261
There was a witness, and we found
his prints on the murder weapon.

27:16.428 --> 27:18.179
- You did?
- Yes.

27:18.346 --> 27:21.850
You're off the hook for everything
that happened this morning.

27:22.017 --> 27:22.934
Thank God.

27:23.101 --> 27:27.605
There's still the matter of you and your
boyfriend's attempted escape from custody.

27:27.772 --> 27:33.862
Officer Brown was badly injured
in the accident. But he's gonna make it.

27:34.029 --> 27:37.949
And we now know that you were
telling him the truth about the bomb.

27:38.116 --> 27:39.868
So I'm free?

27:40.035 --> 27:44.122
You should have somebody from CTU
call the DA's office on your behalf.

27:44.289 --> 27:46.541
But yes, you'll be free to go.

27:50.420 --> 27:54.215
I know my father usually does this,
but I have clearance.

27:54.382 --> 27:57.761
An officer of the company
has to be on the flight.

27:58.011 --> 28:01.139
- I'll be on it. Can you hold on?
- Certainly.

28:01.306 --> 28:03.933
- Where are you going?
- Jakarta.

28:06.019 --> 28:08.229
Surprised I'm giving up my destination?

28:08.396 --> 28:11.441
No. You'll just change it
once you're in the air.

28:13.401 --> 28:16.321
Prep a cargo transport
to Jakarta, Indonesia.

28:16.488 --> 28:18.823
Give us clearance so we can leave tonight.

28:18.990 --> 28:22.077
Who else will be flying with you?

28:22.243 --> 28:24.245
What name should I give them?

28:24.412 --> 28:28.625
- Passport, in my pocket.
- I got it.

28:34.089 --> 28:37.967
- William Patterson.
- One moment, please.

28:42.138 --> 28:45.683
Come on, stay with me.
He's losing consciousness.

28:45.850 --> 28:48.019
Wallace, we can't take this chance.

28:48.186 --> 28:52.607
Tell me where the evidence is, and I give
you my word, I'll get you out of the country.

28:52.774 --> 28:57.612
You know what, Jack? You were a real
badass back there at the warehouse.

28:57.779 --> 29:00.323
Son of a bitch.

29:01.574 --> 29:03.618
No.

29:03.785 --> 29:07.956
- I'm losing him. Dammit.
- What are you doing?

29:08.123 --> 29:12.127
I wanna see if there's an urgent
care center in the neighborhood.

29:12.293 --> 29:14.337
Come on.

29:15.630 --> 29:19.175
Four blocks. Four blocks, make a right. Go.

29:22.637 --> 29:25.974
I want ID's on the bodies.
See what traces are on the weapons.

29:26.141 --> 29:30.145
- Bauer's actions are CTU's responsibility.
- We won't run from this.

29:30.311 --> 29:33.148
- Let's find out who they are.
- Send in forensic teams?

29:33.314 --> 29:34.899
- Yeah.
- NSA and field units?

29:35.066 --> 29:37.610
Yeah, that's fine.

29:38.653 --> 29:42.031
Mr Almeida, Kim Bauer on line four.

29:44.159 --> 29:47.662
- Kim, where are you?
- At a sheriff's station in Santa Clarita.

29:47.829 --> 29:52.083
- What happened?
- I won't be charged for murder, but...

29:52.250 --> 29:56.171
- Look, I still might need some help.
- Sure, what do you need?

29:56.337 --> 30:00.175
They were taking us back to LA,
and my boyfriend and I tried to escape.

30:00.341 --> 30:04.512
And we got into a car accident.
A police officer was injured.

30:04.679 --> 30:08.600
- I'll call the DA's office, see what I can do.
- Thank you.

30:08.766 --> 30:11.603
I'm sure you'd rather be talking
to your dad about this,

30:11.769 --> 30:15.732
but I know they probably told you
he's not available right now.

30:16.816 --> 30:20.153
- What are you talking about?
- He's in the field.

30:21.821 --> 30:24.115
In the field? You mean, he's alive?

30:24.282 --> 30:28.119
Oh, my God, Kim.
You still think he died in the plane.

30:28.286 --> 30:30.955
- He didn't?
- No, no. George Mason took over.

30:31.122 --> 30:33.875
He was able to get out in time.

30:34.042 --> 30:36.878
Oh, my God. When can I talk to him?

30:37.045 --> 30:39.422
Not for a while, Kim.

30:50.266 --> 30:52.393
Come on, come on, get him.

30:59.776 --> 31:02.153
- I need to see the doctor.
- You can't do that.

31:02.320 --> 31:04.322
- Open the door.
- I will call the police.

31:04.489 --> 31:09.202
- Lady, I am the police. Now, open the door.
- Let him in. Let him in.

31:11.120 --> 31:12.664
- We need you.
- What happened?

31:12.830 --> 31:18.002
He's been shot. I'm a Federal Agent.
He has information vital to national security.

31:18.169 --> 31:21.798
I need you to stop the bleeding
and keep him alive.

31:23.091 --> 31:25.260
This is a clinic. He needs a hospital.

31:25.426 --> 31:29.681
We don't have time. You've got to do
what you can now. Doctor, please.

31:29.847 --> 31:34.978
All right. Clara, get me suture kits, lidocaine
with epi, and a crash cart. Now, now.

31:36.396 --> 31:39.816
The wound's right here.
He's got a bullet lodged in his back.

32:07.010 --> 32:10.638
- Hello.
- Miguel, it's me.

32:10.805 --> 32:15.476
- Kim. Are you OK?
- I'm fine. How are you?

32:16.811 --> 32:18.980
- I'm OK.
- Yeah?

32:21.316 --> 32:26.571
Look, it's so weird,
but the police know Gary killed Carla.

32:26.738 --> 32:30.325
We're not gonna be charged with anything,
except maybe the escape.

32:30.491 --> 32:33.578
But I think we're OK there, too.

32:33.745 --> 32:37.332
- That's good.
- Good? It's great.

32:37.498 --> 32:39.667
Yeah.

32:39.834 --> 32:43.504
- How about you?
- I'm fine.

32:43.671 --> 32:45.840
Are you sure? I mean, you don't sound...

32:46.007 --> 32:50.678
I don't sound what? Excited?
Gee, Kim, I'm really sorry.

32:50.845 --> 32:54.223
Miguel, what's wrong?
Why are you acting like this?

32:57.477 --> 33:01.356
- I shouldn't have let you talk me into it.
- Yeah, but it worked out.

33:01.522 --> 33:05.485
For you. I'm the one
that's here in the hospital.

33:06.402 --> 33:10.573
- You just said you were fine.
- I am going to be fine.

33:12.367 --> 33:16.704
- I'm just gonna be fine without you.
- What?

33:17.538 --> 33:21.376
- I don't wanna see you anymore.
- Why not?

33:21.542 --> 33:24.462
- There's no "why not," it just is.
- No.

33:24.629 --> 33:28.091
Miguel, what is going on? Are you OK?

33:30.218 --> 33:34.222
- I'm coming to see you right now.
- Kim, I said no. It's over.

33:35.765 --> 33:38.685
You mean that?

33:40.561 --> 33:43.064
Yeah, I mean it.

34:34.157 --> 34:37.452
I know the rules.
I know that I work for you.

34:37.618 --> 34:40.621
And if you fire me, I wouldn't blame you.

34:40.788 --> 34:43.123
This isn't about me firing you, Michelle.

34:43.291 --> 34:47.043
This agency is supposed to be supporting
the president and this country.

34:47.210 --> 34:49.964
If I can't account for our actions,
we've got chaos.

34:50.130 --> 34:55.386
Jack is in an impossible situation. I was
helping him get proof the audio was fake.

34:55.553 --> 34:59.974
Yeah? Well, where's the proof?
We don't have any proof.

35:00.141 --> 35:02.852
We don't have Jack,
he doesn't want to be found.

35:05.688 --> 35:08.524
What do you want from me, Michelle?

35:14.113 --> 35:17.033
I just wanted to say I'm sorry.

35:19.035 --> 35:22.497
Yeah, well, you've said it.

35:22.663 --> 35:26.959
Now, if you don't mind,
I got work to do, all right?

35:53.736 --> 35:55.613
Our planes are over the Atlantic.

35:55.780 --> 35:58.533
They will be reaching
their targets in three hours.

35:58.699 --> 36:02.036
- The pilots' communication posture?
- Comm is open to them.

36:02.203 --> 36:04.622
The planes can be ordered back
at any time.

36:04.789 --> 36:06.207
Good.

36:06.374 --> 36:10.545
I don't know if anyone's told you, but
the sooner we can lock this mission down,

36:10.711 --> 36:13.881
the more comfortable
the Joint Chiefs will be with it.

36:14.048 --> 36:17.885
My job's not to make
the Joint Chiefs comfortable.

36:18.052 --> 36:20.471
Thank you. That'll be all.

36:20.638 --> 36:22.723
Yes, sir.

36:30.940 --> 36:35.903
Mr President. There's been
a development in Marietta.

36:36.070 --> 36:40.658
The National Guard took on a more
aggressive posture at our request.

36:40.825 --> 36:44.537
But the disturbance got to be
more than they could handle.

36:46.455 --> 36:49.166
What happened?

36:49.333 --> 36:51.669
Two people were killed, sir.

36:51.836 --> 36:57.383
The National Guard started shooting
rubber bullets, and there were two fatal hits.

36:57.967 --> 37:02.555
One of the victims
was a leader of the dissent, and...

37:09.604 --> 37:13.274
- And?
- And the other was a young boy, sir.

37:14.483 --> 37:21.324
He was Middle Eastern, and he was from one
of the families that we were trying to protect.

37:31.167 --> 37:32.460
What's going on now?

37:32.627 --> 37:37.048
They've made some arrests,
but the crowd is still unruly.

37:37.214 --> 37:41.636
Now, we might want to think
about taking a step back.

37:41.802 --> 37:46.223
Maybe the presence of the National Guard
is making matters worse.

37:46.390 --> 37:50.478
If we step back now, those families
are left completely unprotected.

37:50.645 --> 37:52.647
Yeah.

37:52.813 --> 37:54.857
A young boy.

37:57.818 --> 37:59.862
What was his name?

38:01.322 --> 38:03.366
The boy?

38:05.701 --> 38:08.871
- I don't know, sir.
- The boy had a name. Find out.

38:09.664 --> 38:12.124
Indeed I will, sir.

38:23.719 --> 38:26.722
It was a tragic accident.

38:35.064 --> 38:38.192
Tell the National Guard to hold their ground.

38:38.359 --> 38:42.446
I want that neighborhood protected.
I want order restored.

38:42.613 --> 38:44.657
Yes, sir.

38:58.379 --> 39:01.966
There's the bullet. It missed the jugular,
but still caused damage.

39:02.133 --> 39:05.219
- What can you do?
- I might be able to tie off the bleeders.

39:05.386 --> 39:09.890
- You can't get the bullet out without surgery.
- We don't have time for that.

39:10.057 --> 39:12.476
I don't feel comfortable with this.

39:12.643 --> 39:15.896
They can shut me down.
I'm not authorized for this procedure.

39:16.063 --> 39:19.066
I guarantee that won't happen.
I need you to do this now.

39:19.233 --> 39:23.904
- At least tell me what this is all about.
- It has to do with the bomb that went off.

39:24.071 --> 39:27.450
I'm sorry, I can't tell you more than that.

39:29.035 --> 39:31.912
- All right, I'll see what I can do.
- Thank you.

39:32.079 --> 39:34.915
- Give him some Versed.
- No, don't sedate him.

39:35.082 --> 39:39.795
I need him to be able to talk.
Just numb the area around the wound.

39:42.298 --> 39:46.635
Don't worry, beautiful.
I've been worse than this.

39:49.472 --> 39:52.266
- He's gonna die.
- We better hope he doesn't.

39:52.433 --> 39:57.313
OK, so we'll depart at 3:45?
That'd be great. Thank you.

39:58.314 --> 40:01.609
- Is he on?
- They gave us a departure time for 3:45.

40:01.776 --> 40:03.027
Good.

40:03.194 --> 40:06.280
He won't give you information
till we're off the ground.

40:06.447 --> 40:09.116
I told you, I'm not letting you
get on that plane.

40:09.283 --> 40:11.619
All he wants to do is get out of the country.

40:11.786 --> 40:16.999
Soon as we get him to the airport, he'll give
us the information. The rules have changed.

40:18.501 --> 40:20.628
Hold still, almost there.

40:24.673 --> 40:26.967
Stop. It's done.

40:27.134 --> 40:31.555
It's not done. Now, sir, please lie still
or I'll have to sedate you.

40:31.722 --> 40:34.642
- I said, I'm done.
- Push the Versed now.

40:34.809 --> 40:37.394
- Wait.
- Jack.

40:37.561 --> 40:42.733
- What?
- Jack, I'm not gonna make it. I can feel it.

40:42.900 --> 40:45.027
Just tell me where the evidence is now.

40:46.195 --> 40:49.323
It's on a memory chip.

40:50.658 --> 40:53.327
Two AIF files.

40:55.663 --> 41:01.001
The source recordings prove
the Cyprus audio is a fake.

41:01.168 --> 41:03.546
Where is the memory chip?

41:04.505 --> 41:08.175
It's inside...

41:08.342 --> 41:10.928
- Inside what?
- Inside...

41:11.095 --> 41:13.931
Inside where? Come on, Wallace.

41:14.098 --> 41:17.601
Inside where? Doctor.

41:17.768 --> 41:21.272
- He's in V-fib.
- Excuse us. We need to get in here.

41:21.438 --> 41:23.440
- No pulse.
- We're at 200 joules.

41:23.607 --> 41:25.693
Here you go, Doctor.

41:27.194 --> 41:30.865
- Charging. 1-2-3, clear.
- Clear.

41:33.033 --> 41:38.247
- Still in V-fib. Charging, 1-2-3, clear.
- Clear.

41:41.167 --> 41:47.173
- Still in V-fib. Charging, 1-2-3, clear.
- Clear.

41:56.223 --> 41:58.267
He's dead.

42:07.735 --> 42:10.154
Jack, what are we gonna do?

42:10.321 --> 42:12.364
I don't know.

42:14.742 --> 42:17.536
I don't know.

43:02.122 --> 43:06.460
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

43:22.518 --> 43:24.645
We got it.
