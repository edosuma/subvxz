01:21.040 --> 01:23.031
Al.

01:32.240 --> 01:34.800
I knew you'd come back.

01:35.200 --> 01:37.475
They all come back.

01:38.040 --> 01:40.793
You're poison, Al.

01:41.320 --> 01:44.153
But you're my kind of poison.

01:44.400 --> 01:46.550
I'm hip.

01:46.760 --> 01:48.432
Pleasure me, baby.

01:55.560 --> 01:58.518
Oh, Al.

02:08.039 --> 02:10.713
How dare you wake me up that way.

02:11.840 --> 02:13.671
Who did you think you were kissing?

02:17.120 --> 02:18.712
You.

02:19.600 --> 02:21.352
I want you to tell me the truth.

02:21.840 --> 02:26.356
Oh, all right.
I was kissing my dream girl.

02:26.560 --> 02:29.597
She was a magnificent young beast
with a great body...

02:29.800 --> 02:31.950
...and luscious hooters.

02:33.640 --> 02:37.315
Oh, Al. You do dream of me.

02:39.320 --> 02:41.390
All too often.

02:42.000 --> 02:43.797
Now, honey,
you might wanna freshen up.

02:44.000 --> 02:46.355
We're going to your cousin
Jimmy's wedding.

02:46.560 --> 02:48.551
All right, open up.

02:57.400 --> 02:59.231
Missed a spot.

03:02.600 --> 03:06.070
There you are.
Now you're all minty fresh.

03:06.400 --> 03:08.834
No tartar under my arms.

03:10.120 --> 03:11.348
Where's my suit?

03:11.560 --> 03:13.949
Oh, God. Men never know
where anything is.

03:14.160 --> 03:15.991
A woman always knows.

03:16.200 --> 03:17.997
Get up, Buck.

03:18.200 --> 03:20.760
Go on. Good boy.

03:24.360 --> 03:27.352
Well, at least it doesn't smell
like you were wearing it.

03:28.200 --> 03:29.474
Where's my dress shirt?

03:29.720 --> 03:33.190
Where it always is, honey.
At the bottom of the hamper.

03:33.400 --> 03:35.356
Let's see here.

03:35.600 --> 03:38.512
All right. Okay. Oh, there we go.

03:40.760 --> 03:41.829
Here you are.

03:42.040 --> 03:44.395
I swear, if your head
wasn't attached to your body-

03:44.640 --> 03:46.358
Yeah, Buck could be sleeping on it.

03:47.680 --> 03:50.353
- This shirt needs to be ironed.
- I don't feel like ironing.

03:50.600 --> 03:54.388
- But it's a wedding, Peg.
- Oh, all right.

03:54.600 --> 03:56.318
Okay.

04:08.520 --> 04:11.478
All right. I hope you're happy.
I'm exhausted.

04:11.680 --> 04:14.069
- Now get dressed.
- What for?

04:14.280 --> 04:16.793
You're gonna make yourself over
for three hours...

04:17.000 --> 04:19.673
...till you look exactly the same way
you do now.

04:19.880 --> 04:23.031
- Where's my socks?
- Right here, sweetheart.

04:23.240 --> 04:24.753
Here you go.

04:25.920 --> 04:27.990
But, Peg, they don't match.

04:28.200 --> 04:30.760
And look here, look at this.

04:31.200 --> 04:34.272
All right, well, let's see.

04:34.880 --> 04:37.440
There you go. Now they match.

04:39.280 --> 04:41.589
Feels good to give something special
for a wedding.

04:41.800 --> 04:44.792
Yeah. They're gonna love
this clock. It's an antique.

04:45.040 --> 04:47.759
Have you seen
our antique cuckoo clock?

04:50.960 --> 04:52.678
Do you have a warrant?

04:55.000 --> 04:56.991
If my sister could form a thought...

04:57.200 --> 05:00.351
...what she meant was, we are sick
of being accused of stealing...

05:00.560 --> 05:02.915
...every time someone jimmies
open your back door...

05:03.120 --> 05:05.509
...and takes a clock
and a pastrami sandwich.

05:06.480 --> 05:08.198
Now, we demand an apology.

05:08.400 --> 05:11.756
Yeah, and it wouldn't hurt to have
pickles in your refrigerator either.

05:15.520 --> 05:17.829
In other words, it wasn't us.

05:18.080 --> 05:21.152
Well, you know, Marcie,
we really don't have any proof.

05:27.160 --> 05:29.310
It's Petey!

05:29.800 --> 05:32.155
See, I told you they stole my clock.

05:32.360 --> 05:34.874
Jefferson, they must be punished.

05:35.080 --> 05:37.548
Something cruel
and highly unpleasant.

05:37.760 --> 05:41.673
How about you sit them down
and talk to them for a while.

05:44.000 --> 05:46.639
That's something
they'll never forget.

05:48.720 --> 05:50.472
So you don't like our little talks?

05:50.680 --> 05:53.319
Well, we're just gonna
have to talk about that.

05:54.120 --> 05:56.156
Admit it, you always hated Petey.

05:56.400 --> 06:00.791
<i>Now, why would I hate something that
pops out every 15 minutes screaming:</i>

06:03.040 --> 06:05.270
Every hour, every day, every week.

06:07.280 --> 06:08.679
It keeps me up half the night.

06:08.880 --> 06:11.678
I've seen Dionne Warwick
and her Psychic Friends Network...

06:11.880 --> 06:15.714
...a thousand times
because of that clock.

06:15.960 --> 06:17.188
And look my eyes.

06:17.400 --> 06:19.755
Look at them. You know how many
cucumbers it takes...

06:19.960 --> 06:22.679
...to keep the puffing
and the swelling down?

06:22.880 --> 06:24.711
Well, I do.

06:24.960 --> 06:27.269
So last spring...

06:27.480 --> 06:31.519
...Petey didn't really just fall
into the toilet bowl, did he?

06:33.200 --> 06:34.997
I hated that clock.

06:35.200 --> 06:36.679
Yes, I tried to kill him!

06:36.880 --> 06:41.078
I wanted him out of my life,
along with your Elvis plates...

06:41.280 --> 06:44.113
...and your whips and your paddles,
and your big-

06:44.320 --> 06:46.038
Okay, honey.

06:47.800 --> 06:51.793
I don't think that's appropriate talk
to have in front of the little thieves.

06:52.040 --> 06:53.155
Where are your parents?

06:53.760 --> 06:57.389
Peg, leave it alone.
It happens to be mine.

06:57.600 --> 07:00.637
But it just hangs lifelessly.

07:01.000 --> 07:04.072
Let me fiddle with it.
I'll straighten it out.

07:05.480 --> 07:08.517
For God's sake, Peg,
you're gonna pull it off!

07:10.520 --> 07:12.636
Now it's too long.

07:13.520 --> 07:16.273
Most women like it that way.

07:16.560 --> 07:19.996
I don't care what women like.
I'm the one gotta lug it around.

07:22.120 --> 07:25.317
How can these children
possibly know right from wrong?

07:25.520 --> 07:27.954
They need a strong male figure
in their life.

07:28.160 --> 07:30.799
What are you gonna do, Marcie,
move in?

07:35.600 --> 07:37.716
What exactly do you mean by that?

07:37.920 --> 07:39.148
Do you think I'm bossy?

07:39.360 --> 07:42.397
Because I don't think I'm bossy.
Not bossy at all, missy.

07:43.560 --> 07:44.913
Are you calling me masculine?

07:45.120 --> 07:47.918
Because I am not masculine.
I'm feminine!

07:48.120 --> 07:50.111
And my softness is out there
for all to see.

07:50.320 --> 07:52.880
Now, if you don't want
a hook to the liver, little man...

07:53.080 --> 07:55.719
...you'll pick up that clock
and march on home!

08:10.200 --> 08:12.316
It's kind of heavy, Marcie.

08:13.240 --> 08:15.390
Just get the door.

08:23.440 --> 08:26.512
I can lift it. Yeah,
and I'll be able to lift it tonight...

08:26.720 --> 08:30.030
...when it comes time
to dump old Petey in the toilet.

08:32.880 --> 08:35.917
Hey, Petey, surfs up.

08:38.640 --> 08:40.914
Which shoes do you like better?

08:41.559 --> 08:43.278
I don't care.

08:44.200 --> 08:47.636
- Which shoes do you like better?
- I don't care.

08:48.800 --> 08:51.439
Come on, Al. I'm your wife.

08:51.640 --> 08:54.871
I'm a reflection of you,
and I wanna look good for you.

08:55.080 --> 08:59.358
Besides, you are a shoe professional,
and I'd like your opinion.

09:04.400 --> 09:07.198
Well, given the colour of your hair...

09:07.400 --> 09:09.709
...the colour of your dress,
the time of the day...

09:09.920 --> 09:11.638
...and the nature of the event...

09:11.840 --> 09:14.832
...it is my professional opinion that-

09:15.040 --> 09:16.234
Like the gold.

09:16.480 --> 09:19.233
Fine. Then I'll wear the black.

09:20.760 --> 09:22.318
Now hook me up.

09:24.040 --> 09:26.508
Why do women buy clothing
that fastens in the back...

09:26.720 --> 09:28.312
...so they need help to get dressed?

09:28.520 --> 09:30.511
<i>You don't hear men
in the locker room saying:</i>

09:30.720 --> 09:33.234
" Hey, Fred, give me a hand
with this zipper. "

09:33.880 --> 09:36.792
Yeah, they're just saying,
" Hey, Fred, smell this.

09:37.000 --> 09:39.355
I don't need a shower, do I?"

09:40.280 --> 09:42.111
So how do I look?

09:42.840 --> 09:44.432
You look nice.

09:44.640 --> 09:46.153
Then I have to change.

09:47.000 --> 09:49.116
I was only kidding you, Peg.
You look terrible.

09:49.320 --> 09:53.108
I'm embarrassed to be seen with you.
Come on, Peg, let's go.

09:56.440 --> 09:58.874
Listen, Kel, I need some help.

09:59.120 --> 10:01.156
There's gonna be some girls
at the wedding...

10:01.360 --> 10:04.193
...and I'm planning
on buttering one up.

10:04.400 --> 10:07.233
Now, what do you think
would be my best pick-up line?

10:08.480 --> 10:11.517
<i>All right. How about this:</i>

10:11.760 --> 10:16.072
" Hey, Miss, I'm the Keebler elf.
Would you like some free cookies?

10:18.000 --> 10:20.639
If you've got the time,
I've got the Hollow Tree. "

10:22.760 --> 10:24.955
Yeah, maybe I asked
the wrong person.

10:25.200 --> 10:28.556
You're used to responding to,
"Yo, here. "

10:31.400 --> 10:35.279
Oh, okay, you little gibbon.
How about this?

10:35.520 --> 10:37.590
You see a girl,
but before she sees you...

10:37.800 --> 10:40.314
...stand on her feet so she can't run.

10:41.160 --> 10:42.434
<i>Then you say to her:</i>

10:42.640 --> 10:44.949
"You are the most beautiful girl
I have ever seen.

10:45.160 --> 10:47.594
I'd love to share a night
of incredible sex with you.

10:47.800 --> 10:52.828
No names, no questions, no regrets.
Come be one with me. "

10:55.800 --> 10:57.472
<i>You really think that's better than:</i>

10:57.680 --> 11:01.309
" Let's do it. I have my own bedroom
in my parents' house"?

11:07.560 --> 11:08.549
- Hi.
- Hi.

11:08.760 --> 11:12.196
- Oh, my God. You guys look so great.
- That dress looks so pretty.

11:12.400 --> 11:16.075
The three of us are gonna make
one beautiful bridesmaid.

11:16.600 --> 11:18.795
Hey, wait,
are we in different colours?

11:20.240 --> 11:23.073
Well, you'd know.
You're the smart one.

11:23.720 --> 11:26.234
- Let's colour-coordinate.
- Okay.

11:29.800 --> 11:31.233
Who's he?

11:31.440 --> 11:35.035
I don't know. From up here
he looks like an ant.

11:43.520 --> 11:44.748
Hi.

11:44.960 --> 11:46.951
Where did Corky and Heidi go?

11:47.160 --> 11:50.709
One of them had an idea,
and the others are crowning her queen.

11:51.240 --> 11:53.037
They were supposed
to come right back.

11:53.240 --> 11:54.639
I'm driving them to the church.

12:02.280 --> 12:04.191
See anything you like?

12:05.160 --> 12:07.071
Indeed I do.

12:18.000 --> 12:20.798
I think you're the most
beautiful girl I've ever seen.

12:21.000 --> 12:23.753
I'd like to share a night
of incredible sex with you.

12:23.960 --> 12:26.838
No names, no questions, no regrets.

12:27.040 --> 12:28.712
Come be one with me.

12:29.200 --> 12:32.078
What? I'm sorry, I didn't hear you.

12:32.280 --> 12:34.635
I was distracted by the pain.

12:34.840 --> 12:36.717
You're standing on my foot.

12:39.880 --> 12:43.429
Did anyone ever tell you how much
you look like the Keebler elf?

12:47.480 --> 12:51.393
Well, you wanna come upstairs
and see how cookies are really made?

12:59.040 --> 13:01.395
What am I saying?
Of course you wouldn't.

13:08.840 --> 13:11.149
Let's go upstairs and bake.

13:18.240 --> 13:20.037
You should come too.

13:22.120 --> 13:24.429
Now, thanks to me, we match.

13:33.800 --> 13:35.870
I think we made an excellent choice.

13:36.080 --> 13:40.835
Nothing says " bridesmaid" or "easy"
like short, black leather.

13:41.920 --> 13:43.911
Hey, Janie's not in the car.

13:44.160 --> 13:46.037
Well, we can't wait for her.
We'll be late.

13:46.280 --> 13:49.670
Relax. They can't start the wedding
without her. She's the bride.

13:55.880 --> 13:59.475
Well, she couldn't have gone anywhere.
Her car's still outside.

14:00.600 --> 14:04.479
I just called Information.
They are morons.

14:05.440 --> 14:08.432
They didn't even know
that Janie was getting married.

14:09.320 --> 14:13.313
They didn't know anything.
They didn't even know who I was.

14:13.560 --> 14:16.711
God, they should call themselves
Stupid-nation.

14:17.200 --> 14:18.599
Well, where could she be?

14:18.840 --> 14:22.276
She's in here with the time lady
and the weather guy...

14:22.480 --> 14:28.316
...and that jerk who just goes... when
you leave the phone off the hook.

14:28.520 --> 14:32.149
Sometimes I wish I could yell real loud
so I wouldn't need a phone at all.

14:32.920 --> 14:35.480
Kel, I was talking about Janie.

14:35.680 --> 14:39.229
God, what could a bride be doing
before her wedding?

14:45.080 --> 14:46.798
Hi, guys.

14:47.000 --> 14:49.639
Bud was just showing me
around the house.

14:49.880 --> 14:51.598
Wow, cool outfits.

14:51.800 --> 14:55.475
Nothing says " bridesmaid" or "easy"
like short, black leather.

14:56.760 --> 14:58.990
Well, come on. Let's get me married.

15:00.680 --> 15:01.999
Aren't you nervous?

15:02.200 --> 15:05.670
Not anymore. I'm loose as a noodle.

15:09.240 --> 15:10.992
Bud?

15:34.760 --> 15:36.751
What did you do?

15:38.000 --> 15:40.309
A gentleman never tells.

15:41.280 --> 15:43.430
I had sex.

15:45.800 --> 15:47.791
With a girl.

15:49.360 --> 15:51.635
And I did it good.

15:52.440 --> 15:55.750
- Oh, my God.
- That's what she said.

15:56.720 --> 15:58.312
Twice.

15:58.840 --> 16:00.398
What? Once when you
got undressed...

16:00.600 --> 16:02.795
...and again when you put on
your bunny slippers?

16:03.600 --> 16:06.672
Save your barbs for someone
who's not getting any.

16:06.880 --> 16:08.598
Like Mom.

16:10.560 --> 16:13.074
I feel good. Yep, I do.

16:13.280 --> 16:16.795
Talk all you want.
Nothing can bring me down.

16:17.360 --> 16:20.591
You just had sex with your
cousin Jimmy's bride.

16:22.840 --> 16:24.592
Well, that did it.

16:26.680 --> 16:28.875
God, I look great.

16:29.120 --> 16:33.796
I am so glad I'm not one of those
women who needs a lot of makeup.

16:37.120 --> 16:38.712
Oh, please.

16:38.920 --> 16:42.879
Only Tammy Faye, Zsa Zsa
and Bozo use more.

16:44.400 --> 16:48.075
Oh, come on, Al.
Admit it. I look great.

16:48.280 --> 16:51.636
Hey, I'd look great too
if I used makeup.

16:52.160 --> 16:54.993
You know, I'd be one
dynamite-looking babe.

16:55.200 --> 16:57.270
In a masculine way.

16:57.480 --> 17:00.392
I could highlight my eyes.
They're my best quality.

17:00.600 --> 17:02.158
Baby blue.

17:02.360 --> 17:05.590
Like Sinatra, Newman, the sea.

17:05.800 --> 17:07.438
Well, maybe my second-best quality.

17:07.680 --> 17:10.353
Because I'm known
for my killer butt.

17:11.960 --> 17:13.632
Oh, yeah. It's very nice, honey...

17:13.839 --> 17:16.752
...and has more hair on it
than your head.

17:18.480 --> 17:21.756
That's because my butt doesn't
wake up in the morning looking at you.

17:23.880 --> 17:26.314
That's not your butt?

17:28.560 --> 17:30.755
Oh, God, we have
so much fun together...

17:30.960 --> 17:33.599
...especially when
we're belittling you.

17:33.800 --> 17:35.358
But you know, I really do-

17:35.560 --> 17:38.438
I think I look as good as I did
the day we got married.

17:38.640 --> 17:41.837
Well, that's your opinion.
You take the calls.

17:43.200 --> 17:45.077
Now, come on, Grumpy.

17:45.280 --> 17:47.396
You know you love me.

17:47.600 --> 17:49.397
Go on. Say it.

17:49.920 --> 17:52.195
I don't want to.

17:52.400 --> 17:54.595
Come on, Al.

17:54.800 --> 17:57.234
I love beer. I love bowling.

17:57.440 --> 17:59.954
I don't wanna cheapen
the meaning of the word.

18:01.120 --> 18:04.078
All right, then. Don't say it.

18:04.280 --> 18:05.633
Just kiss me...

18:05.840 --> 18:07.876
...and make it a good one.

18:08.080 --> 18:11.550
I'd almost kind of rather say it.

18:12.320 --> 18:14.834
Oh, all right.

18:22.000 --> 18:25.675
Oh, Al. Now you've ruined
my makeup.

18:25.880 --> 18:27.996
Oh, I'll have to start all over.

18:28.200 --> 18:29.872
I never thought you'd really kiss me.

18:30.120 --> 18:33.271
- God, what an idiot.
- Oh, now, Peg...

18:37.920 --> 18:39.831
Oh, my God.

18:40.640 --> 18:42.756
I can't go to the wedding.

18:42.960 --> 18:45.793
I must never ever see Janie again.

18:46.280 --> 18:47.872
Although she might kill herself...

18:48.080 --> 18:50.878
...when she finds out
she can never touch this again.

18:51.520 --> 18:55.035
I mean, I know I would
if I couldn't touch me again.

18:57.760 --> 18:59.034
Oh, God.

19:00.200 --> 19:01.553
Oh, God.

19:02.200 --> 19:04.111
Boy, that really is safe sex.

19:05.840 --> 19:09.389
There's something I have to tell you.
What we did might have been wrong.

19:09.600 --> 19:11.352
You know, with the wedding and all.

19:11.560 --> 19:14.711
Look, I made a mistake. I don't know
how I could have done this.

19:14.960 --> 19:16.678
Don't blame yourself.

19:16.880 --> 19:19.235
Blame God for giving me this body.

19:21.080 --> 19:22.479
No, it was my fault.

19:22.720 --> 19:26.349
I wanted a final fling with someone
I could never be interested in...

19:26.560 --> 19:28.596
...or attracted to.

19:29.280 --> 19:30.872
And you were perfect.

19:31.960 --> 19:33.678
Thanks, baby.

19:34.320 --> 19:35.878
I knew it was perfect.

19:36.080 --> 19:39.277
But you're right.
It can never happen again.

19:39.480 --> 19:41.311
- For Jimmy's sake.
- And ours.

19:41.520 --> 19:43.750
Since we both know
he's a psychopathic ex-con.

19:44.000 --> 19:47.879
- I mean, 10 years for attempted murder.
- That's right. I heard he did a drive-by.

19:48.920 --> 19:50.956
Well, I gotta go now.

19:51.800 --> 19:53.279
Good luck.

20:01.640 --> 20:03.915
I knew you'd come back.

20:05.040 --> 20:07.429
They always come back.

20:07.920 --> 20:10.992
But they don't always
bring their sisters.

20:14.680 --> 20:16.398
Al.

20:18.560 --> 20:20.278
You again.

20:21.120 --> 20:23.031
Come on, honey. Let's go.

20:23.280 --> 20:25.350
And they say women
are the slow ones.

20:25.560 --> 20:27.312
You know, this is an historical first.

20:27.520 --> 20:31.274
We are actually in the bedroom,
and I am waiting for you to finish.

20:33.840 --> 20:36.718
Peg, if I need the time,
I will take the time...

20:36.920 --> 20:38.717
...because I care about
what I look like.

20:50.320 --> 20:51.958
I'm ready.

20:52.520 --> 20:54.875
Honey, do you ever think
what it would be like...

20:55.080 --> 20:56.672
...if we never got married?

20:57.280 --> 20:59.635
Actually, I was thinking that
right now, Peg.

21:00.080 --> 21:01.832
Seriously, Al.

21:02.080 --> 21:04.150
Seriously, Peg.

21:04.400 --> 21:08.473
Oh, come on. Your life would be hell
without me, and you know it.

21:08.680 --> 21:10.716
You couldn't find anyone
better than me.

21:10.920 --> 21:13.753
Come on, admit it.
I'm your perfect mate.

21:14.000 --> 21:16.468
- Admit it.
- No.

21:17.320 --> 21:19.709
All right, then. Why don't
you give me a picture...

21:19.920 --> 21:21.990
...of what your ideal mate would be.

21:22.200 --> 21:23.713
Fine.

21:24.120 --> 21:26.634
A magnificent young girl...

21:26.840 --> 21:30.310
...with a beautiful face, slim thighs...

21:30.520 --> 21:33.432
...and a firm apple of a heinie...

21:33.640 --> 21:36.950
...and a set of delicious,
scrumptious hooters.

21:38.040 --> 21:40.190
Oh, Al, it's me!

21:42.480 --> 21:45.756
Oh, honey,
you would marry me again.

21:45.960 --> 21:47.473
No.

21:53.360 --> 21:55.635
Hi, Mom. Hi, Dad.

22:03.120 --> 22:05.918
What a beautiful bride.

22:09.440 --> 22:12.318
Looks like we'll have a little time
before the wedding.

22:13.480 --> 22:17.155
Good. I didn't like
this dress anyhow.
