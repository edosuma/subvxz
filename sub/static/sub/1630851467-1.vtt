It's okay. Just ten more minutes.

Did you sleep well?

What?

03:44.120 --> 03:46.680
It breaks my heart, but I will let you go.

about Yu-mi not in a relationship.]

You can email him.
Are you delivering it in person?

print it out anyway.

It's the deadline for accounting.

07:38.280 --> 07:40.680
Why did he ask where in Ilsan I live?

07:40.760 --> 07:43.560
That was out of nowhere. I'm curious now.

07:43.960 --> 07:47.080
[Yu-mi. Get to work. You're busy.]

07:47.480 --> 07:49.680

[Kim Yu-mi]

08:01.120 --> 08:03.200

08:04.440 --> 08:06.160
Ms. Kim. I got you coffee.

08:06.240 --> 08:08.640

is really handsome...

08:16.080 --> 08:17.440
Are you done?

08:18.800 --> 08:21.160
-Pardon?
-The sales report.

08:21.840 --> 08:23.680
-No, not yet.
-Well,

08:23.760 --> 08:26.600
I have a meeting at 11 a.m..
I'd like to see it before that.

08:26.680 --> 08:28.080
Okay.

08:34.919 --> 08:36.320
What for?

08:37.640 --> 08:39.720
Go ask him when I'm this busy?

08:41.679 --> 08:42.919
[Right. What for?]

08:43.120 --> 08:44.280
[Work is more important now.]

08:44.360 --> 08:45.800
[What are you talking about?]

08:46.040 --> 08:48.200
[Maybe he's sending a signal.]

08:48.600 --> 08:50.840
[Who asks a girl her address
first thing in the morning?]

08:50.920 --> 08:52.400
[There's definitely something.]

[You think so?]

08:53.920 --> 08:55.040
[Yes!]

09:14.280 --> 09:15.760
Oh, my.

09:18.800 --> 09:20.880
Reason, there's definitely something.

09:20.960 --> 09:22.920
I'm sure of it!

09:23.320 --> 09:26.840
Emotion, are you saying
Ugi is interested in Yu-mi too?

09:26.920 --> 09:29.120
Yes, I think so.
That's what my hunch is telling me.

09:29.200 --> 09:30.240
-Seriously?
-For real?

09:30.320 --> 09:31.760
Ugi likes Yu-mi?

09:31.840 --> 09:33.080
Really? My gosh.

09:33.160 --> 09:34.680
Reason, let's find out.

09:34.760 --> 09:36.720
Such mutual attraction is only natural.

09:47.560 --> 09:49.680
It is natural to be mutually attracted.

10:02.080 --> 10:03.160
Right.

10:03.600 --> 10:06.160
I'll look into it
and let you know next time.

10:06.240 --> 10:07.680
-I'll find out.
-Sounds good.

10:14.640 --> 10:16.440
-Let's start the meeting.
-Sure.

10:19.120 --> 10:20.240
Excuse me for a moment.

10:24.040 --> 10:25.880
Don't you think this is a bit much?

10:25.960 --> 10:27.360
Making him step out during a meeting.

10:27.440 --> 10:29.240
The meeting hasn't begun yet.

10:29.320 --> 10:31.400
She can bring it up casually
as if she just thought of it.

10:31.480 --> 10:33.360
Hold on, guys.

10:33.800 --> 10:35.640
I feel anxious.

10:35.720 --> 10:37.240
What's wrong, Anxiety?

10:37.480 --> 10:41.560
I'm worried her co-workers
would think it's strange.

10:43.280 --> 10:44.960
[I mean, look at their faces.]

10:45.080 --> 10:46.760
[Especially her, Ruby.]

10:49.440 --> 10:52.320
What if Ruby spreads rumors?

10:52.400 --> 10:55.000
My point exactly. Asking where she lives
isn't even a big deal.

10:55.400 --> 10:56.720
Everyone will know.

10:56.800 --> 10:59.560
Everyone will say she's trying
to hit on a guy who's five years younger!

11:02.640 --> 11:03.840
Did you ask for me?

11:04.720 --> 11:05.720
What's up?

11:10.640 --> 11:11.640
Yu-mi.

11:12.400 --> 11:14.080
Right, I was just...

11:14.160 --> 11:16.160
[-Yu-mi, no!
-Yu-mi, no!]

11:21.200 --> 11:22.920
Guess why I called you out.

11:25.360 --> 11:26.400
Sorry?

11:26.520 --> 11:27.680
Take a guess.

11:28.920 --> 11:29.960
What?

11:30.760 --> 11:33.600
Mr. Oh is here. You should go back in.

11:33.960 --> 11:34.960
Yu-mi.

11:36.920 --> 11:38.080
Gosh.

11:42.920 --> 11:44.800
Hey, Yu-mi. Where were you?

11:45.120 --> 11:46.320
I got you a coffee.

11:47.800 --> 11:49.680
Here. Drink it before the ice melts.

11:50.240 --> 11:51.240
Thank you.

12:00.360 --> 12:02.160
What did I do just now?

12:03.160 --> 12:04.200
What?

12:05.320 --> 12:06.480
-Oh, boy!
-Oh, boy!

12:06.560 --> 12:08.960
Seriously, what was that?

12:09.040 --> 12:10.760
It's a good thing
that she didn't tell him.

12:10.840 --> 12:12.240
She almost made a fool of herself.

12:12.320 --> 12:14.960
It's a good thing?
You guys frustrate me so much.

12:15.040 --> 12:17.120
Fine. We'll let her grow old all alone!

12:18.160 --> 12:21.000
Emotion, wouldn't it be better

12:21.080 --> 12:23.960
to be remembered as a graceful co-worker
than a fool?

12:24.040 --> 12:25.560
You cowards!

12:41.560 --> 12:43.920
[There, you just got a little taste
of this story.]

12:44.920 --> 12:49.200
[The daily life of Yu-mi
and the cells that love her.]

12:54.040 --> 12:55.960
[Finance Department]

12:58.520 --> 13:01.760
Mr. Nam, Ms. Kim.
I'll get going. Don't work too hard.

13:01.840 --> 13:03.120
-Bye.
-Bye.

13:03.200 --> 13:04.960
-Have a good evening.
-Bye.

13:10.520 --> 13:15.480
This multiplied by 0.033...

13:18.760 --> 13:20.280
It doesn't match.

13:21.920 --> 13:23.720
How come nothing's matching?

13:27.080 --> 13:28.560
My brain isn't working.

13:46.080 --> 13:48.360
Emotion! Can you help me?

13:49.040 --> 13:50.480
-Whatever.
-What?

13:52.520 --> 13:55.160
I haven't used this in a while,
so it won't move.

13:55.240 --> 13:58.040
Help me out here, Emotion!
The deadline is today.

13:58.120 --> 14:01.200
Gosh, you're in charge of the brain.

14:01.280 --> 14:03.600
I'm in charge of her emotion.
Why are you asking me?

14:03.760 --> 14:06.280
The sooner she gets this done,
the sooner she can go home.

14:07.520 --> 14:11.080
Otherwise, she can't see the sunset,
which you love.

14:11.160 --> 14:12.160
The sunset?

14:24.280 --> 14:26.720
Guys, what are you all waiting for?
Do you not want to call it a day?

14:26.800 --> 14:28.240
-We should.
-We should.

14:31.480 --> 14:32.440
-Gosh.
-Push.

14:32.520 --> 14:35.280
Nice. It's moving now. Keep it up!

14:36.440 --> 14:39.160
-One, two.
-One, two.

14:41.840 --> 14:46.080
Oh, I got it. Nice. I knew it.

14:46.280 --> 14:47.640
This was it.

14:52.600 --> 14:53.640
What?

14:53.760 --> 14:56.800
-One, two.
-One, two.

14:56.920 --> 14:57.960
What's going on?

14:58.680 --> 14:59.720
-No!
-No!

15:06.480 --> 15:07.920
Why must you show up now?

15:08.000 --> 15:10.200
You picked the worst time to show up,
Hunger!

15:13.520 --> 15:17.040
I'm hungry. I want to eat something.

15:18.560 --> 15:19.720
I'm hungry.

15:22.360 --> 15:23.800
Gosh, I'm starving.

15:27.200 --> 15:28.280
No.

15:30.000 --> 15:31.440
If I step out now, I'll waste 30 minutes.

15:33.120 --> 15:35.200
No. I should just wait.

15:47.040 --> 15:48.400
-I'm hungry.
-Stop, Hunger!

15:48.480 --> 15:52.360
I'm hungry! Give me something to eat!

15:52.840 --> 15:55.080
Look at him. He keeps on growing.

15:55.160 --> 15:58.400
-Stop!
-I'm hungry! Feed me!

16:00.760 --> 16:02.240

16:02.320 --> 16:03.440
To pick up some gimbap.

16:03.520 --> 16:05.400
Hey, let's go for food together
after we finish this.

16:05.480 --> 16:07.160
I can't wait. My hands are shaking.

16:08.960 --> 16:10.960
She must be starving.

-Here you go.
-Thank you.

16:26.800 --> 16:28.280
-Thank you. Have a good day.
-Thank you.

Hey, Ugi.

16:52.640 --> 16:54.080
You're still here.

You're not done yet?

16:55.320 --> 16:57.000
No, not yet. I'm still working on it.

16:57.440 --> 16:58.600
What about dinner, then?

16:59.320 --> 17:01.240
-I bought some gimbap.
-Is that enough food for you?

17:01.840 --> 17:02.920
Yes, it's totally enough.

17:03.960 --> 17:05.520
Pick one.

17:06.280 --> 17:09.119
I've got an iced coffee,
a latte, and an iced tea.

17:09.200 --> 17:11.119
There's peppermint too.
I bought one of everything.

17:11.359 --> 17:13.560
-No, thanks. I'm good.
-I got an extra anyway.

17:14.400 --> 17:15.480
Which one do you want?

17:15.800 --> 17:18.520
Then... I'll take the iced coffee.

17:19.800 --> 17:21.720
-It's this one.
-Thanks.

17:23.079 --> 17:24.160
Hold on.

17:26.240 --> 17:27.280
Careful.

18:04.600 --> 18:05.920
You almost dropped it.

18:06.920 --> 18:07.920
You're going in, right?

18:08.040 --> 18:09.200
Yes. Shall we?

18:17.080 --> 18:18.240
I'll get the door.

-Come in.
-Okay.

18:45.840 --> 18:46.840
Thanks.

19:07.240 --> 19:08.760
Do you still have a lot left to do?

19:09.280 --> 19:11.760
-What?
-Do you have a lot left to do?

19:12.200 --> 19:13.800
No, I'm...

19:13.880 --> 19:16.480
We're almost done.
We just have to finish up.

19:16.560 --> 19:18.240
-About half an hour...
-Hold on.

19:19.480 --> 19:21.440
-Detective.
-Stupid.

19:21.760 --> 19:24.160
What time she finishes
doesn't matter right now.

19:24.880 --> 19:29.480
Ugi wants to know whether or not
he can work late with her.

19:29.560 --> 19:30.680
What makes you say that?

19:30.760 --> 19:31.880
Want to know?

19:32.240 --> 19:34.760
Look at the drinks he's holding.

19:35.680 --> 19:37.360
[Why did he buy so many?]

19:37.520 --> 19:40.400
[It means his department
will be working late as well.]

19:41.480 --> 19:42.640
One more thing.

19:42.800 --> 19:45.040
The conclusive clue from this morning.

19:45.120 --> 19:46.240
-What?
-A clue?

19:46.320 --> 19:48.080
-What was it?
-A clue from this morning?

19:48.160 --> 19:50.120
Stupid. Don't you get it?

19:50.360 --> 19:52.800
Don't you know why he said that
this morning?

19:53.040 --> 19:55.600
You live in Ilsan, right? Where in Ilsan?

19:56.360 --> 19:57.400
[Then...]

19:57.480 --> 19:59.800
Ugi had it all planned out.

19:59.880 --> 20:02.240
He knew that today was his chance.

20:02.760 --> 20:04.920
That they may work late together,

20:05.000 --> 20:07.120
leave in his car together,

20:07.200 --> 20:08.920
and he may take her home

20:09.000 --> 20:10.160
-and...
-And?

20:10.240 --> 20:15.080
Perhaps it will be
a night they never forget.

20:16.800 --> 20:19.160
[Got that? So no matter what,]

20:19.240 --> 20:21.720
[Yu-mi must work late at all costs.]

20:22.400 --> 20:23.600
Do I have a lot of work left?

20:28.000 --> 20:29.360
Too much.

20:29.960 --> 20:31.160
I'll be here a while.

20:32.240 --> 20:33.320
Really?

20:34.360 --> 20:35.920
I think I'll be here late.

20:37.160 --> 20:38.320
I see.

20:40.000 --> 20:42.880
Are you working late too?

20:43.600 --> 20:44.640
Me?

20:46.800 --> 20:47.840
No.

20:50.280 --> 20:51.640
What?

20:52.040 --> 20:55.280
I felt bad that the others are
working late, so I got this for them.

20:56.680 --> 20:59.320
What a shame. You said you live in Ilsan.

20:59.960 --> 21:02.160
I'm going there today

21:02.520 --> 21:04.880
so I was going to drop you off
if you got off work early.

21:06.320 --> 21:08.200
It was my chance
to win some brownie points.

21:09.120 --> 21:10.200
What a shame.

21:20.200 --> 21:21.280
Aren't you getting in?

21:29.280 --> 21:30.920
Detective? As if.

21:31.000 --> 21:32.880
You call that a deduction?

21:32.960 --> 21:34.080
You stupid fool.

21:34.160 --> 21:37.040
Why did you have to butt in
and ruin everything?

22:01.440 --> 22:02.760
I'm leaving.

22:02.840 --> 22:04.360
-Okay.
-Bye.

22:04.440 --> 22:05.760
-See you tomorrow.
-Yu-mi.

22:05.840 --> 22:07.960
This is delicious. Aren't you having any?

22:09.400 --> 22:11.520
You've lost your touch, Yu-mi.

22:11.880 --> 22:12.920
What?

22:13.000 --> 22:16.120
I've lost my touch and my hunches are off.

since she had a boyfriend?]

22:37.120 --> 22:38.160
[No.]

for the past three years.]

and desire to have a relationship.]

49:13.920 --> 49:16.320
Maybe she was just cheerful and tactless.

50:40.640 --> 50:42.240
to set him up with Yu-mi.

50:43.880 --> 50:45.120
Why would she do that?

50:45.280 --> 50:47.960
Ruby going out with Ugi has
nothing to do with us.

[The moment the old bachelor Mr. Nam
shows Yu-mi interest...]

51:22.800 --> 51:23.920
Ugi.

51:26.200 --> 51:27.280
Let's go.

51:27.920 --> 51:31.400
[Ugi's likely to stop paying attention
to Yu-mi.]

51:32.080 --> 51:33.160
[Why?]

51:33.440 --> 51:35.640
Ugi is a loyal guy.

51:38.280 --> 51:40.880
That means, Ruby got us again.

51:40.960 --> 51:44.480
That wrench with nine tails!

51:44.560 --> 51:45.680
Then I'm not going.

51:46.000 --> 51:49.200
I'd rather not go. Tell them to go alone.

51:49.440 --> 51:51.080
-That's a no.
-Why?

51:51.840 --> 51:52.960
If Yu-mi bails out,

51:53.040 --> 51:55.400
[Mr. Nam will become a third wheel.]

51:55.480 --> 51:57.520
[He's highly unlikely to go.]

52:01.800 --> 52:03.480
[Then it will be a date]

52:04.160 --> 52:06.440
[like Ruby planned.]

52:07.360 --> 52:10.520
We're stuck in Ruby's trap.

52:11.840 --> 52:14.640
I've always hated Ruby!

52:14.720 --> 52:16.040
What now?

52:16.600 --> 52:18.920
What do we do now?

52:20.160 --> 52:21.480
I have no idea either.

52:21.560 --> 52:24.160
This isn't my specialty, you know.

52:25.880 --> 52:27.640
We have to do something.

52:28.040 --> 52:31.120
Would you be happy
if your crush went out with someone else?

52:32.520 --> 52:34.800
Are we going to let her
be all lonely forever?

52:34.880 --> 52:37.400
Do you want to see her
veg out alone at home every weekend?

52:38.040 --> 52:40.000
Her weekends have been the same
for three years.

52:40.080 --> 52:42.400
She's so lonely every night.

52:42.760 --> 52:45.040
I'm really sick of it now!

52:46.040 --> 52:48.080
Agreed. I'm sick of it too!

52:48.160 --> 52:49.560
Emotion is right.

52:49.960 --> 52:51.880
We can't let her live like this forever.

52:52.120 --> 52:54.360
That's right. We absolutely can't.

52:54.440 --> 52:56.800
-Let's turn things around.
-Guys, let's fight.

52:56.880 --> 52:58.720
An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth!

52:58.800 --> 53:00.400
Love must be won.

53:00.640 --> 53:02.480
Let's take Ruby down!

53:02.560 --> 53:05.080
-Let's take her down!
-Yes!

53:06.120 --> 53:08.440
Ugi, let's go to this place for drinks
after dinner.

53:08.960 --> 53:11.280
There are many reviews,
and the rating is high.

53:11.680 --> 53:13.480
-Shall we check it out?
-Yes.

53:14.160 --> 53:15.720
Or how about this place?

53:15.800 --> 53:18.800
This place looks good too,
but we'd have to make a reservation today.

53:21.520 --> 53:24.000
Ms. Kim, can I ask you something?

53:24.400 --> 53:26.840
-Sure.
-I totally let it slip my mind,

53:27.320 --> 53:30.960
but we'll hear about the contract
for Germany on Sunday, right?

53:32.480 --> 53:34.360
That means
we should come into the office that day.

53:34.640 --> 53:37.320
Yes, you're right.

53:38.120 --> 53:40.280
I totally forgot.

53:40.600 --> 53:42.760
Can we check out the festival
tomorrow instead?

53:44.520 --> 53:45.880
Looks like we have no choice.

53:45.960 --> 53:47.960
I'm okay with that,
but I don't think Ruby is available.

53:48.040 --> 53:49.440
Tomorrow, I can't.

53:49.840 --> 53:51.280
I have to go to Busan tomorrow.

53:52.040 --> 53:53.120
I see.

53:55.640 --> 53:58.120
Can't you just take care of it quickly?

53:58.360 --> 54:00.880
Or maybe work on it
after we get back from the festival.

54:00.960 --> 54:03.880
I don't think we can do that.
We have to work around their schedule.

54:03.960 --> 54:05.680
Then how about we move it to next week?

54:05.760 --> 54:07.800
Next week? The festival will be over.

54:07.880 --> 54:09.000
I see.

54:10.400 --> 54:12.880
-Then what should we do?
[-Now's our chance.]

54:14.960 --> 54:16.960
Think of a joke

54:18.680 --> 54:19.960
[True Feeling]

54:19.360 --> 54:22.160
with a grain of truth in it.

54:22.920 --> 54:26.600
There we go. Here's our bait.

54:26.680 --> 54:27.800
Fishing cell.

54:27.880 --> 54:30.560
Will this work?
Don't you think it'll be too obvious?

54:30.640 --> 54:33.400
Don't worry, Emotion.
It does sound like a joke,

54:33.480 --> 54:35.160
so there are plenty of ways
to work around it.

54:35.240 --> 54:37.000
Go for it, bait!

54:37.080 --> 54:39.000
Come back with a big fish!

54:40.960 --> 54:43.240
Then the three of us
should just go tomorrow

54:43.640 --> 54:45.400
without Ruby.

54:45.200 --> 54:47.400
[Daehan Noodles]

54:47.760 --> 54:49.880
But I was the one who suggested this.

54:49.960 --> 54:51.520
I was just joking, Ruby.

54:51.600 --> 54:52.880
We won't go without you.

54:52.960 --> 54:54.560
We can't go without you two either.

54:57.720 --> 55:00.040
I'm okay
with sticking with the original plan.

55:02.120 --> 55:03.560
That would be better.

55:03.920 --> 55:06.440
The three of you can go and have fun.

55:11.680 --> 55:14.360
Nice. I got you!

55:14.440 --> 55:15.960
-It's coming up!
-It's coming up!

55:18.440 --> 55:20.120
Are you sure you're okay with it?

55:20.880 --> 55:22.960
Yes. Ruby is totally fine.

55:23.320 --> 55:25.280
I'll go with my friends another time.

55:29.680 --> 55:32.720
Then the three of us will go together
tomorrow, which is Saturday...

55:32.800 --> 55:33.960
Count me out.

55:34.480 --> 55:35.520
Pardon?

55:35.840 --> 55:39.120
Just count me out.
Ugi and Ms. Kim, you two can go.

55:40.320 --> 55:41.360
-Why?
-Why?

55:41.760 --> 55:45.360
I just realized
that I have a busy day tomorrow.

55:46.920 --> 55:48.600
I'll join you guys next time.

55:48.880 --> 55:51.160
Wait, Mr. Nam.

55:51.240 --> 55:52.560
Have fun!

55:57.720 --> 56:00.440
What was that? She said
we should go together. I'm disappointed.

56:09.640 --> 56:12.320
Then will it be just us two, Yu-mi?

56:20.160 --> 56:21.840
[Date]

56:20.200 --> 56:21.960
-Nice!
-We caught a big fish!

56:22.040 --> 56:23.400
-A date!
-It's a date!

56:24.880 --> 56:26.680
Score!

56:25.360 --> 56:27.240
[Date]

56:29.680 --> 56:32.240
Oh, you're right.

56:32.800 --> 56:35.360
How did this happen?

56:36.920 --> 56:39.120
-Shall we go, then?
-Let's go together tomorrow.

56:39.200 --> 56:42.560
Gosh, I wasn't even interested
in checking it out at first.

56:42.760 --> 56:44.120
I don't even know how this happened.

56:44.240 --> 56:45.480
Yu-mi, will you be okay?

56:46.080 --> 56:48.280
-What?
-You'd probably be uncomfortable.

56:49.600 --> 56:50.560
What?

56:50.640 --> 56:52.920
Yu-mi.

56:53.600 --> 56:54.840
Will it make you uncomfortable?

56:55.600 --> 56:58.120
Of course, she'll be uncomfortable
if it's just the two of you.

56:58.200 --> 56:59.880
You can't pick up on hints, can't you?

57:00.120 --> 57:03.160
She didn't even want to go.
She only said yes because I pestered her.

57:04.200 --> 57:05.200
I see.

57:06.680 --> 57:08.400
[Ruby is stepping in again!]

57:12.000 --> 57:14.480

[Date]

57:14.560 --> 57:17.040
Ruby, that little...
I will teach her a lesson!

57:17.120 --> 57:18.560
That sly witch!

57:18.680 --> 57:20.600
Gosh, this is so frustrating!

57:20.680 --> 57:23.800
This darn flower festival.
Let's make it happen already!

57:25.760 --> 57:28.360
Just tell him you don't care
and that you'll go with him!

57:28.440 --> 57:29.840
No!

57:30.240 --> 57:34.360
What if Ruby spreads some crazy rumors?

57:34.680 --> 57:36.600
Everyone at work will gossip

57:36.680 --> 57:39.400
about her hitting on a guy
who's five years younger.

57:39.480 --> 57:41.200
Stop talking about his age.

57:41.280 --> 57:42.760
We all know that he's younger!

57:42.880 --> 57:45.640
People might call her a cougar!

57:46.520 --> 57:48.560
The moment she threw the bait...

57:48.640 --> 57:52.160
If she barges in like that
and snatches up that young guy,

57:52.240 --> 57:53.880
they'll call her a cougar.

57:55.240 --> 57:57.000
So is she going or not?

57:57.080 --> 57:59.120
I'm about to explode!

57:59.200 --> 58:00.560
-Gosh!
-Be quiet.

58:00.640 --> 58:02.360
Quiet down, guys.

58:02.440 --> 58:04.760
-I can't take this!
-Be quiet!

58:05.160 --> 58:06.240
Get out of my way.

58:07.680 --> 58:08.720
What's the matter?

58:10.040 --> 58:12.240
-Isn't that Love?
-Love is here.

58:12.320 --> 58:14.560
-Is that Love?
-It's Love.

58:14.640 --> 58:16.120
-Love is here!
-Love.

58:16.280 --> 58:17.520
-It's Love.
-My gosh.

58:17.640 --> 58:20.000
Love, are you all right?

58:20.360 --> 58:21.560
-Love!
-Love!

58:21.760 --> 58:23.320
When did you wake up?

58:23.400 --> 58:25.680

58:28.360 --> 58:29.920
Go get True Feeling.

58:31.280 --> 58:33.600
-Wait!
-True Feeling? Why?

58:33.680 --> 58:35.680
We can't let her reveal
her true feelings right now.

58:35.760 --> 58:37.160
She's at work now.

58:37.360 --> 58:40.800
Guys, this is when
she must show her true feelings.

58:41.240 --> 58:43.760
How can she win love
without showing her true feelings?

58:48.960 --> 58:50.880
I'm so frustrated!

58:50.960 --> 58:53.400

Ugi, don't make her uncomfortable.
Let's just go together another time...

59:14.560 --> 59:15.960
Why would it make me uncomfortable?

59:17.240 --> 59:19.520
-Sorry?
-Why can't the two of us go together?

59:22.040 --> 59:23.440
I don't care.

59:24.360 --> 59:25.840
I actually prefer it this way.

59:31.280 --> 59:32.960
Let's go together, Ugi.
