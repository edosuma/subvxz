00:03.871 --> 00:06.774
[theme music]

00:08.376 --> 00:12.046
The Conners' annual seance
to reach the spirit world

00:12.080 --> 00:14.282
is about to begin.

00:14.315 --> 00:19.820
Eenie, meanie, chili beanie,
the spirits are about to speak.

00:19.853 --> 00:20.921
Ah!

00:20.954 --> 00:22.790
The table's takin' off!
- Mark, Mark, relax.

00:22.823 --> 00:23.757
Mr. Conner's doing it.

00:23.791 --> 00:26.694
He does it every year.

00:26.727 --> 00:27.928
Spirits speak.

00:27.961 --> 00:29.130
Now is the time.

00:29.163 --> 00:31.932
It's getting hard to
make things rhyme.

00:31.965 --> 00:34.135
If it does not fit,
you must acquit.

00:39.873 --> 00:42.543
(SINGING) Well,
since my baby left me.

00:42.576 --> 00:44.044
I found a new place to dwell.

00:44.078 --> 00:45.179
ROSEANNE: Elvis!

00:45.213 --> 00:46.914
(SINGING) It's down at
the end of Lonely Street

00:46.947 --> 00:48.349
at Heartbreak Hotel.

00:48.382 --> 00:49.350
Thank you very much.

00:49.383 --> 00:50.451
Now I'd like to do
one for my momma.

00:50.484 --> 00:53.254
ROSEANNE: Elvis, Elvis.

00:53.287 --> 00:54.222
Yeah?

00:54.255 --> 00:56.657
Lisa Marie married
Michael Jackson.

00:59.993 --> 01:02.330
[bonk]

01:05.333 --> 01:08.136
But now we must make an
offering to the spirits.

01:08.169 --> 01:11.071
Uh, Mrs. Conner, you're not
gonna open those eggs, are ya?

01:11.105 --> 01:12.306
Yeah, honey,
they've been sitting

01:12.340 --> 01:13.374
there for like seven years.

01:13.407 --> 01:15.176
It must be done.
I cannot stop.

01:15.209 --> 01:17.545
I'm being controlled
from the other side.

01:17.578 --> 01:19.079
[groan]

01:20.080 --> 01:21.048
You know what?

01:21.081 --> 01:22.683
Holidays here you
are just wrong.

01:26.354 --> 01:29.957
Hey, DJ, you stay on lighted
streets and be home by 10:00.

01:32.660 --> 01:33.461
Hi.

01:41.535 --> 01:44.938
[theme music]

02:22.943 --> 02:25.846
[laughs]

02:28.949 --> 02:30.951
[cackles]

02:32.286 --> 02:35.189
Greetings, it is I, the
Wicked Witch of the Midwest.

02:38.359 --> 02:43.764
Oh, Yeah well, I am
Sophia, Queen of the Gypsies,

02:43.797 --> 02:47.000
Consort of Wizards,
Seer of Souls!

02:47.034 --> 02:50.871
But I can fly on a broom, and
I can turn children into stone.

02:50.904 --> 02:54.308
And I can put a spell on you.

02:54.342 --> 02:56.344
No one could ever
put a spell on Sophia.

02:56.377 --> 02:59.146
I'm wearing my
anti-spell repellent.

02:59.179 --> 03:01.515
Oh, but I can!

03:01.549 --> 03:04.552
Because paper covers rock,
and witch beats gypsy!

03:04.585 --> 03:05.886
[cackles]

03:05.919 --> 03:08.556
And I know what beats witch!

03:08.589 --> 03:09.990
[makes spraying sound]

03:10.023 --> 03:11.425
I'm melting!

03:11.459 --> 03:12.326
I'm melting!

03:16.264 --> 03:19.300
But you underestimated
my arsenal!

03:19.333 --> 03:23.871
I will select the cheese ray!

03:23.904 --> 03:24.772
Too bad for you!

03:24.805 --> 03:27.174
I have a cheese ray deflector!

03:27.207 --> 03:29.377
Drat!

03:29.410 --> 03:30.978
Enough of this
childish nonsense.

03:34.648 --> 03:37.718
Arm yourself.

03:37.751 --> 03:39.219
En garde!

03:39.253 --> 03:43.757
Join me, and rule with
me on the dark side, Luke!

03:43.791 --> 03:45.225
Never!

03:45.259 --> 03:48.629
[swishing sounds]

03:52.766 --> 03:53.634
Ow, ow!

03:53.667 --> 03:56.103
[swishing sounds]

03:56.136 --> 03:58.506
[screams]

04:03.544 --> 04:05.913
[screams]

04:07.481 --> 04:09.883
[laughs maniacally]

04:17.391 --> 04:18.659
Remember me, Jackie?

04:24.097 --> 04:26.934
Not Mrs. Butterworth.

04:26.967 --> 04:28.636
Remember how when
you were a little girl,

04:28.669 --> 04:31.104
your sister Roseanne told
you how I came to life

04:31.138 --> 04:32.005
at night in the cupboard?

04:32.039 --> 04:33.774
No, Roseanne, don't do it.

04:33.807 --> 04:35.809
Remember how I used
to chase you around,

04:35.843 --> 04:37.110
even though I have no legs?

04:37.144 --> 04:38.512
Stop it, Roseanne, stop it!

04:38.546 --> 04:43.351
Well, I'm back, and all I want
is one more little sticky kiss.

04:43.384 --> 04:45.853
[screams]

04:47.955 --> 04:50.858
[spooky music playing]

04:51.959 --> 04:53.594
Bow down, all of you.

04:53.627 --> 04:57.698
Bow down to the
power of the Ouija.

04:57.731 --> 05:01.034
Focus all energy on
this magical conduit,

05:01.068 --> 05:03.904
its board derived
from ancient goat skin

05:03.937 --> 05:06.840
stretched taut in the
Mesopotamians sun,

05:06.874 --> 05:10.978
its pointer hewn from diamonds.

05:11.011 --> 05:14.815
It says "made by
Parker Brothers."

05:14.848 --> 05:16.650
All hail Brothers Parker!

05:16.684 --> 05:19.387
All hail Brothers Parker!

05:19.420 --> 05:20.488
All right, that's it.

05:20.521 --> 05:21.455
I mean, this is stupid.

05:21.489 --> 05:23.957
Seances, the Ouija board.

05:23.991 --> 05:26.026
I mean, what's the point?

05:26.059 --> 05:27.895
The point?

05:27.928 --> 05:31.331
The point is that on this one
special night of the year--

05:31.365 --> 05:32.533
[hums dramatically]

05:32.566 --> 05:35.102
ROSEANNE: --the veil is
lifted between the living

05:35.135 --> 05:37.137
and the dead.

05:37.170 --> 05:39.006
And only on this
one night can we

05:39.039 --> 05:44.177
contact those in the other
world then summon them here!

05:44.211 --> 05:46.380
[howls]

05:47.415 --> 05:49.617
I got homework!

05:49.650 --> 05:52.052
[doorbell ringing]

05:52.085 --> 05:53.887
[laughs]

05:56.890 --> 05:57.825
BOYS: Trick or treat.

05:57.858 --> 05:59.292
Smell my feet.

05:59.326 --> 06:01.595
Give me something good to eat.

06:01.629 --> 06:03.497
Hi.

06:03.531 --> 06:05.365
Oh my god!

06:05.399 --> 06:07.735
This house is so warm and cozy!

06:07.768 --> 06:09.236
I love it!

06:09.269 --> 06:10.370
Oh, thank you so much.

06:10.404 --> 06:13.807
You are nice, nice, nice.

06:13.841 --> 06:16.444
Hey, this is like
deja vu all over again.

06:19.312 --> 06:20.280
Goodbye.

06:20.313 --> 06:21.181
Bye!

06:21.214 --> 06:22.282
Happy Halloween!

06:22.315 --> 06:23.116
Bye.

06:29.857 --> 06:32.225
Gee, I wish we had
a daughter that sweet.

06:35.262 --> 06:37.831
Just wasn't in
the cards, honey.

06:37.865 --> 06:38.732
Look at this.

06:38.766 --> 06:40.067
This is all pure sugar.

06:40.100 --> 06:40.968
Uh-huh.

06:41.001 --> 06:43.937
There's chemicals in there too.

06:43.971 --> 06:45.305
Keeps it nice and fresh.

06:45.338 --> 06:46.874
It's disgusting.

06:46.907 --> 06:48.108
Come on, we should
be giving children

06:48.141 --> 06:50.177
what their bodies need.

06:50.210 --> 06:51.078
Here.

06:51.111 --> 06:52.379
They need this.

06:52.412 --> 06:53.447
ROSEANNE: What the hell is that?

06:53.481 --> 06:55.082
Oh, wait a minute, honey.

06:55.115 --> 06:57.084
I've seen this before.

06:57.117 --> 07:01.354
It-- it's food that
doesn't come in wrappers.

07:01.388 --> 07:03.491
That's unsanitary!

07:03.524 --> 07:05.392
[doorbell ringing]

07:07.928 --> 07:09.129
CHILDREN: Trick or treat.

07:09.162 --> 07:10.363
Hey, guys.

07:10.397 --> 07:11.599
Now who wants the plum?

07:14.902 --> 07:16.537
Apple for you.

07:16.570 --> 07:19.072
And a nectarine, OK.

07:19.106 --> 07:20.207
Happy Halloween, you guys.

07:20.240 --> 07:21.274
David, David.

07:21.308 --> 07:24.011
Do you want to close
that door real fast?

07:24.044 --> 07:25.746
Why?

07:25.779 --> 07:27.615
[banging]

07:34.622 --> 07:35.489
DAN: Stupid.

07:35.523 --> 07:36.456
[doorbell ringing]

07:36.490 --> 07:37.658
Halloween rush hour!

07:41.094 --> 07:44.197
Oh, what a cute little dog.

07:44.231 --> 07:47.735
Hold on, lady, sign this.

07:47.768 --> 07:51.171
Candy provider is fully liable
for any dental damage caused

07:51.204 --> 07:53.073
by aforementioned confections.

07:53.106 --> 07:55.142
I'm not signing that!

07:55.175 --> 07:57.044
I'm gonna sue you
so fast that you're

07:57.077 --> 07:58.946
gonna need Johnnie Cochran to--

08:10.357 --> 08:13.527
That's the scariest
costume all night!

08:13.561 --> 08:15.428
[doorbell ringing]

08:22.469 --> 08:25.806
Who are you supposed to be?

08:25.839 --> 08:26.707
Ho am I?

08:26.740 --> 08:28.075
I'm Ed McMahon.

08:28.108 --> 08:31.144
You won our special
Halloween jackpot.

08:31.178 --> 08:32.512
OK.

08:32.546 --> 08:37.250
What is a refrigerator,
a poolside dressing room,

08:37.284 --> 08:39.086
and Ed McMahon?

08:39.119 --> 08:44.925
A refrigerator, a poolside
dressing room, and Ed McMahon?

08:44.958 --> 08:48.796
What is an Amana, a cabana,
and a famous second banana.

08:51.665 --> 08:53.533
[doorbell ringing]

08:58.038 --> 08:59.406
[screams]

09:00.473 --> 09:02.242
- What is it?
- It's hideous.

09:02.275 --> 09:03.176
It's so scary.

09:06.747 --> 09:08.649
BOTH: [scream]

09:13.721 --> 09:15.455
Very funny, everyone.

09:15.488 --> 09:16.824
[doorbell ringing]

09:16.857 --> 09:19.526
I'm surprised all that screaming
didn't scare off this gaggle

09:19.559 --> 09:21.428
of children coming up after me.

09:21.461 --> 09:23.230
Hey, you got a whole
gaggle out there?

09:23.263 --> 09:25.165
David, come on.
It's showtime.

09:25.198 --> 09:26.233
Oh, goody!

09:26.266 --> 09:28.936
I'm just in time for
the fun and frolic!

09:28.969 --> 09:29.870
What's the trick?

09:29.903 --> 09:31.271
What the trick?

09:31.304 --> 09:32.439
Don't ask.

09:32.472 --> 09:34.474
Just let the fun carry you away.

09:34.507 --> 09:35.976
Oh!

09:36.009 --> 09:39.947
This is just like
[inaudible] and chance.

09:39.980 --> 09:42.415
DAN: [laughs]

09:42.449 --> 09:43.917
CHILDREN: Wow!

09:43.951 --> 09:45.418
Awesome!

09:45.452 --> 09:46.419
Cool!

09:46.453 --> 09:47.888
That's awesome!

09:47.921 --> 09:49.389
Wow!

09:49.422 --> 09:50.891
Awesome!

09:50.924 --> 09:51.859
That's cool!

09:51.892 --> 09:54.261
Wow!

09:54.294 --> 09:56.096
Whoa.

09:56.129 --> 09:57.230
BEVERLY: Oh, what fun!

09:57.264 --> 09:58.165
I'm wearing black.

09:58.198 --> 09:59.833
Let me try try.

09:59.867 --> 10:01.769
[makes ghoulish sounds]

10:01.802 --> 10:04.638
CHILDREN: [laughter]

10:09.643 --> 10:11.078
DAN: [laughs]

10:11.111 --> 10:13.046
BEVERLY: Oh what silly fun!

10:13.080 --> 10:16.850
But why did all those
children run away so quickly?

10:16.884 --> 10:19.519
Oh, I'm guessing you
took their Sears catalog

10:19.552 --> 10:20.788
experience to the next level.

10:23.891 --> 10:24.992
Want a soda?

10:25.025 --> 10:26.159
OK!

10:26.193 --> 10:29.596
But make mine sprite
because that's what I am!

10:33.066 --> 10:34.134
Cool.

10:34.167 --> 10:37.204
Alone at last, just
you, me, and the spirits

10:37.237 --> 10:38.706
of the nether world.

10:38.739 --> 10:40.407
Two people
unafraid to discover

10:40.440 --> 10:41.742
the hidden answers
to the world's

10:41.775 --> 10:43.476
most terrifying questions.

10:43.510 --> 10:46.246
Let's ask it something
very important.

10:46.279 --> 10:47.748
Oh spirits--

10:47.781 --> 10:48.816
Roseanne, don't move it.

10:48.849 --> 10:50.150
You haven't even asked
i ta question yet.

10:50.183 --> 10:51.284
I'm not moving it.

10:51.318 --> 10:53.721
I'm not moving it.

10:53.754 --> 10:54.822
ROSEANNE: Oh my god.

10:54.855 --> 10:55.655
It's going by itself!

10:58.325 --> 11:05.632
T-H-E-D. Thed, what's thed?
- Wait, there's more.

11:05.665 --> 11:13.606
T-H-E-D-E-A-D. It stopped.

11:13.640 --> 11:17.377
[gasps] Thed Ad.

11:17.410 --> 11:19.412
It's telling us Thed Ad!

11:22.249 --> 11:25.485
No, no, it's
spelling "the dead."

11:25.518 --> 11:27.855
[gasps] Oh, dead--

11:27.888 --> 11:30.123
if it's OK to call you that--

11:30.157 --> 11:31.024
speak to us.

11:31.058 --> 11:31.925
Tell us your message.

11:31.959 --> 11:33.260
Ask it a question.

11:33.293 --> 11:35.228
OK.

11:35.262 --> 11:37.230
Um.

11:37.264 --> 11:40.300
When am I gonna have my baby?

11:40.333 --> 11:41.134
N-O--

11:44.471 --> 11:46.406
JACKIE: November!

11:46.439 --> 11:47.407
ROSEANNE: W.

11:47.440 --> 11:48.308
November!

11:48.341 --> 11:49.709
You're having it in November.

11:52.545 --> 11:54.982
No, Jackie, no!

11:55.015 --> 11:58.886
I meant I'm having it now!

11:58.919 --> 12:01.789
[screams]

12:09.763 --> 12:11.231
[monitor beeping]

12:12.399 --> 12:15.035
Hmm, looks like this
baby's in a hurry.

12:15.068 --> 12:16.837
You're already at
six centimeters.

12:20.240 --> 12:23.710
Whoa, what's going on here?

12:23.743 --> 12:25.145
It's just a skeleton costume.

12:25.178 --> 12:27.848
We're having a little Halloween
party for some of the patients.

12:27.881 --> 12:29.616
This is the problem with HMOs.

12:29.649 --> 12:30.884

I'm hallucinating or something.

13:14.661 --> 13:16.864
Oh, relax, lady.
I'm a bear.

13:16.897 --> 13:18.731
I just dressed like a
human for Halloween.

on, I can do better than this.

13:35.815 --> 13:38.085
I've had better hallucinations
after too much MSG.

13:53.266 --> 13:56.103
Don't even think about doing
the disappearing quarter bit.

on my happy place.

14:39.146 --> 14:43.283
This is the master's laboratory
where he does his research.

14:43.316 --> 14:44.184
Ah!

14:44.217 --> 14:45.953
There's the master now!

14:45.986 --> 14:50.223
Or is that just one
of his experiments?

14:50.257 --> 14:52.025
Got an aspirin?

14:52.059 --> 14:54.461
I've got a splitting headache!

I wouldn't go too near
the chef, if I was you.

You might end up
being the main course!

Would you like to try some of
our delicious intestinal stew?

Well, I come from six feet under
with a dead guy on my knee.

15:23.723 --> 15:27.627
I'm heading down to Hades
for to spend eternity.

15:27.660 --> 15:30.830
Hey, there, dead girl,
I think it's plain to see.

15:30.863 --> 15:34.834
We bought a cardboard casket,
and now worms have eaten me.

15:38.838 --> 15:39.872
Darlene, you're
not even ready.

15:39.906 --> 15:42.142
We're gonna be
leaving any minute.

15:42.175 --> 15:44.444
I don't feel so good.

15:44.477 --> 15:45.478
What's wrong?

15:45.512 --> 15:47.514
It's my stomach.

15:47.547 --> 15:49.416
[groans] Oh my god!

15:49.449 --> 15:51.718
[screams]

15:55.622 --> 15:58.725
So, what, do you want, some
Pepto Bismol or something?

15:58.758 --> 16:01.928
Has anybody got a light?

16:01.961 --> 16:05.365
So, uh, is this
the whole thing?

16:05.398 --> 16:06.933
This is what we've
been waiting for?

16:06.966 --> 16:11.071
Oh, no, Dan, no.

OK, I propose a toast to
the all-time greatest prank

16:49.142 --> 16:50.977
in the history of the universe.

16:51.010 --> 16:52.412
I'm just so ashamed.

16:52.445 --> 16:54.181
I have nothing to top that with.

17:22.375 --> 17:26.879
The Ouija board wasn't sending
me a message from the dead.

a message from--

No need to be sad.

Up here in the
clouds, well, it's

17:48.768 --> 17:50.637
even better than the clouds
that hung over my audience.

17:53.340 --> 17:55.175
Why'd you come here?

17:55.208 --> 17:56.809
I have a message for you.

17:56.843 --> 17:59.379
From God?

17:59.412 --> 18:01.481
No, from me.

18:01.514 --> 18:04.484
Oh, well, that's OK too.

18:04.517 --> 18:07.220
The message is,
what we need is magic,

18:07.254 --> 18:11.658
and bliss, and myth, and
celebration, and religion.

18:11.691 --> 18:15.695
We need spiritual
connection to each other.
