00:01.913 --> 00:04.142
Previously on "Angel from Hell"...

00:04.236 --> 00:05.669
Geez, I'm so sorry.

00:05.671 --> 00:07.538
No worries, accidents happen.

00:07.540 --> 00:10.607
I'll bet you're a very sweet person,
Dr. Allison.

00:10.609 --> 00:14.077
- How did you know my name?
- It's me, Amy, from the farmers' market.

00:14.079 --> 00:16.580
- Who's this bit o' honey?
- I'm Brad. I'm the brother.

00:16.582 --> 00:20.348
Your mother died 412 days ago.
And since then you've buried yourself

00:20.452 --> 00:22.853
<i>in work, buried yourself in a relationship.</i>

00:22.855 --> 00:24.421
How do you know all that stuff?

00:24.423 --> 00:27.624
Honey, I'm your guardian angel.

00:27.626 --> 00:30.327
<i>He's working on boning your best friend.</i>

00:30.329 --> 00:32.494
Evan and I hooked up.

00:32.497 --> 00:36.333
- It's not that I believe you're an angel.
- But?

00:36.335 --> 00:37.801
I could use a weird friend.

00:37.803 --> 00:40.971
Do they come any weirder? (chuckles)

00:42.975 --> 00:44.708
Breakfast burritos are so good.

00:44.710 --> 00:45.876
They should make dinner burritos.

00:45.878 --> 00:47.010
That's a billion-dollar idea,

00:47.012 --> 00:48.211
Brad, it's called burritos.

00:48.213 --> 00:50.580
I was realizing that as I said it.

00:50.582 --> 00:51.915
Well, thanks for taking me out, guys.

00:51.917 --> 00:54.484
Third day in a row. It's delicious.

00:54.486 --> 00:56.052
Yeah, but you didn't finish it.
Are you okay?

00:56.054 --> 00:58.125
You're not still upset about Evan?

00:58.189 --> 00:59.188
Honey, you got to eat.

00:59.190 --> 01:00.423
Did you not get enough guac?

01:00.425 --> 01:01.757
Do you need more guac?

01:01.759 --> 01:03.092
My sister just had her heart broken

01:03.094 --> 01:04.360
and she's running low on guac.

01:04.361 --> 01:05.394
Guys, I'm fine about the breakup.

01:05.396 --> 01:06.395
Still bring that guac.

01:06.397 --> 01:07.396
We're all hurtin'.

01:07.398 --> 01:08.531
(phone buzzes)

01:09.140 --> 01:10.066
Is that Evan again?

01:10.068 --> 01:11.400
He's not still calling!

01:11.402 --> 01:13.140
He keeps texting, trying to apologize.

01:13.214 --> 01:15.473
All right, say the word and we
will exact Fuller justice.

01:15.536 --> 01:16.138
Yeah.

01:16.174 --> 01:17.473
Remember, I'm from Brooklyn.

01:17.475 --> 01:18.941
Dad, you left Brooklyn when you were one

01:18.943 --> 01:20.443
- and moved to L.A.
- Very formative year.

01:20.445 --> 01:22.411
And I did wrestle in high school.

01:22.413 --> 01:23.946
So you get me a referee and a mat

01:23.948 --> 01:25.181
and make sure we weigh the same,

01:25.183 --> 01:26.549
and Fuller justice will be served.

01:26.551 --> 01:27.884
Guys, please don't do anything.

01:27.886 --> 01:30.145
I just want to bury
this chapter of my life.

01:30.198 --> 01:32.622
- Buried alive. Got it.
- Stop it. Leave it alone.

01:32.624 --> 01:34.457
- All right, we'll take the high road.
- Yeah.

01:34.459 --> 01:36.493
- View's better from up there anyway.
- I got to get to work.

01:36.495 --> 01:38.528
Me, too.
Houses don't sell themselves, people.

01:38.530 --> 01:41.064
Actually, lately they do.
The market is super hot right now.

01:41.066 --> 01:42.999
I'm just baking open house
cookies and cashing checks.

01:43.001 --> 01:44.934
- Then why'd you make Dad pay?
- Hmm? Oh.

01:44.936 --> 01:46.569
I'm so sorry, guys...
I should probably take this.

01:46.571 --> 01:48.104
- That's my phone.
- I should take this.

01:48.106 --> 01:49.973
Uh-huh. Uh, I think I'm gonna stay here

01:49.975 --> 01:51.508
and finish up my paperwork.

01:51.510 --> 01:53.343
My first appointment canceled.
Turns out it wasn't

01:53.345 --> 01:55.245
a mole... She slept on a chocolate chip.

01:55.247 --> 01:56.312
- Good news.
- Yeah.

01:56.314 --> 01:57.547
- I'll see you at the office.
- Okay.

02:00.191 --> 02:02.752
I can't believe how little
your family talks about sex.

02:02.754 --> 02:05.121
I actually found myself
reading the newspaper.

02:05.123 --> 02:07.600
Oh, it's gonna be so much more fun

02:07.621 --> 02:09.526
being your guardian
angel now that I can just

02:10.088 --> 02:12.019
walk up to you and say...

02:12.072 --> 02:13.996
You're working too hard

02:13.998 --> 02:17.800
and you're not having enough fun.

02:17.802 --> 02:20.636
Okay, um, hi. How are you?

02:20.638 --> 02:22.004
I'm wonderful!

02:22.006 --> 02:23.524
Wow. Um, okay, where to start?

02:23.577 --> 02:25.435
- Well, I did say we could be friends.
- Yes,

02:25.456 --> 02:27.229
and that is a legally binding statement.

02:27.292 --> 02:29.129
So, when am I gonna get to
meet the old family, huh?

02:29.160 --> 02:31.514
- I'm gonna think of you like a tattoo.
- Oh, good.

02:31.516 --> 02:33.349
Yeah, you're cool,
bigger than expected,

02:33.351 --> 02:35.636
and it's best if my family
never finds out about you.

02:35.699 --> 02:38.354
No, no, no. I got it.
It's kind of complicated

02:38.356 --> 02:40.957
to introduce me to your family,
especially when you can't reveal

02:40.959 --> 02:42.191
that I'm your guardian angel.

02:42.193 --> 02:43.760
Yeah. Now, you know

02:43.762 --> 02:45.061
- you can't reveal that, right?
- I was kind of

02:45.063 --> 02:47.163
hoping <i> you</i> would stop revealing it.

02:47.165 --> 02:48.698
Oh. Can we have this
conversation someplace else?

02:48.700 --> 02:51.234
I'm getting a little freaked
out by all the crazy talk.

02:51.236 --> 02:54.070
Crazy talk? Allison, that is not very PC.

02:54.906 --> 02:56.472
And it's called Spanish.

02:56.474 --> 02:58.875
- I was talking about <i> you,</i>
- Oh.

02:58.877 --> 03:00.543
and I would rather have this conversation

03:00.545 --> 03:02.412
- when people are not around.
- Oh.

03:02.414 --> 03:04.247
Where would that be, where we could have

03:04.249 --> 03:06.783
this conversation with no people around?

03:08.805 --> 03:11.001
Would you like to come by my house later?

03:11.117 --> 03:11.988
Yeah, sure.

03:11.990 --> 03:13.756
That could be totally awesome.

03:13.758 --> 03:15.324
- Mm.
- Yeah.

03:15.326 --> 03:17.727
- Okay, then. So...
- Ah, no, I hear you.

03:17.729 --> 03:19.962
Until-until tonight at your house.

03:21.232 --> 03:22.465
Oh, and, uh, don't worry...

03:22.467 --> 03:25.067
I know exactly where you live.

03:25.069 --> 03:26.736
Wait. What?

03:26.738 --> 03:28.938
You've been to my house?

03:28.940 --> 03:30.427
S01E02
Face Your Fears

sync and corrected by ninh
www.addic7ed.com

03:38.903 --> 03:41.370
Wow, I can't believe I'm in your house.

03:41.372 --> 03:43.017
- And you're awake.
- Huh.

03:43.069 --> 03:46.553
The line between stalker
and angel seems very thin.

03:46.605 --> 03:48.167
Mm. And I can tell there's

03:48.213 --> 03:49.946
a part of you that doesn't believe

03:49.948 --> 03:51.448
- I'm your guardian angel.
- Oh, it's...

03:51.450 --> 03:53.216
all of me that doesn't believe

03:53.218 --> 03:54.951
you're my guardian angel.

03:54.953 --> 03:57.854
<i>But</i> I am curious just how many cars

03:57.856 --> 03:59.189
are on this crazy train, so...

03:59.191 --> 04:01.124
why don't you tell me a little bit

04:01.126 --> 04:02.692
about how you see the world.

04:02.694 --> 04:05.729
(imitates buzzer) Worlds.
There's nine worlds.

04:05.731 --> 04:07.564
Ask me anything you like.

04:07.566 --> 04:09.833
So, why do <i> I</i> need a guardian angel?

04:09.835 --> 04:11.168
There are so many people

04:11.170 --> 04:13.270
that need a guardian angel more than I do.

04:13.272 --> 04:14.538
Well, and they all have them.

04:14.540 --> 04:16.540
You see, guardian angels are like herpes.

04:16.541 --> 04:18.141
Everyone has a version of it

04:18.142 --> 04:19.476
that they don't know about.

04:19.478 --> 04:21.577
And no matter how hard they try,

04:21.579 --> 04:23.413
they can't get rid of us.

04:23.415 --> 04:24.714
Sweet ad campaign.

04:24.716 --> 04:27.284
So if these angels are... everywhere,

04:27.286 --> 04:29.445
why is there zero evidence that they exist?

04:29.530 --> 04:31.688
Oh, my goodness,
there's evidence everywhere.

04:31.690 --> 04:34.958
99% of all coincidences
are angels pulling strings.

04:34.960 --> 04:36.193
And the other one percent?

04:36.195 --> 04:38.328
The one percent... They control everything.

04:38.330 --> 04:40.597
Do you not get <i>The Wall Street Journal?</i>

04:40.599 --> 04:43.588
So you've been protecting me my whole life?

04:43.630 --> 04:46.110
Yep. Except the time you
were kicked by the cow.

04:46.142 --> 04:48.095
See, because I <i> also</i> wanted
to see what would happen if you

04:48.126 --> 04:50.406
- pulled its tail.
- So if you're an angel,

04:50.470 --> 04:52.276
- do you fly?
- No. We are flightless...

04:52.278 --> 04:53.677
Which technically makes us poultry.

04:53.679 --> 04:56.146
- Do you feel pain?
- No. But that might be the codeine.

04:56.148 --> 04:57.881
- Do you talk to God?
- Oh, Allison, do the people

04:57.883 --> 04:59.817
at the Apple Store talk to Tim Cook?

04:59.819 --> 05:01.885
So, what would be the one thing that people

05:01.887 --> 05:03.987
would be surprised to learn about angels?

05:03.989 --> 05:05.849
We can catch anything that's thrown to us.

05:05.880 --> 05:07.758
- What does that mean?
- Throw me something.

05:08.327 --> 05:10.127
Whoa. Not bad.

05:10.963 --> 05:12.292
My job...

05:12.672 --> 05:14.398
is to protect you.

05:15.374 --> 05:16.936
And if I miss something...

05:17.633 --> 05:19.026
I've failed.

05:20.206 --> 05:21.472
Impressive. (chuckles)

05:21.474 --> 05:24.007
So, you're like an unpaid bodyguard.

05:24.009 --> 05:26.677
No, we don't just guard. We teach lessons.

05:26.679 --> 05:29.246
Lessons? Really?
What kind of lessons do you teach?

05:29.248 --> 05:31.148
Piano? Swim lessons?

05:31.150 --> 05:32.716
Oh, we don't swim, Allison.

05:32.718 --> 05:34.518
(chuckles): We're not water goblins.

05:34.520 --> 05:35.786
No, we teach life lessons.

05:35.788 --> 05:37.154
In fact, it's probably the biggest,

05:37.156 --> 05:38.555
most important part of my job.

05:38.557 --> 05:41.258
So, what am I to learn from a woman

05:41.260 --> 05:43.393
whose fly is currently open?

05:43.395 --> 05:46.196
The value of a gentle breeze.

05:46.198 --> 05:48.232
And now that you've learned that,
let's move on

05:48.234 --> 05:51.016
to the next lesson:
confronting your biggest fear.

05:51.375 --> 05:52.842
You know what that is?

05:53.022 --> 05:56.006
I don't know. Uh, clowns? Spiders?

05:56.008 --> 05:57.841
Well, those are fears and
they should be confronted,

05:57.843 --> 06:00.544
but I'd put those more in the
category of yikesies.

06:00.546 --> 06:02.246
No, this is, like, the scary stuff.

06:02.248 --> 06:04.381
The stuff that when you leave
your house in the morning,

06:04.383 --> 06:09.453
you say: Oh, man,
I hope I don't have to face <i> this</i> today.

06:09.455 --> 06:10.821
Kelly.

06:10.823 --> 06:12.589
Yes, Calleigh.

06:12.591 --> 06:13.657
Kelly...

06:13.659 --> 06:14.642
Kelly, Kelly, Kelly.

06:14.663 --> 06:16.960
- Is my oldest friend...
- Right.

06:16.962 --> 06:19.062
- And we had a fight...
- Brutal falling out.

06:19.064 --> 06:20.063
I remember it perfectly.

06:20.065 --> 06:21.331
Because if I didn't remember it,

06:21.333 --> 06:23.133
I'd get in trouble with my supervisor

06:23.135 --> 06:24.968
for being drunk on the job. (chuckles)

06:24.970 --> 06:27.004
- It was a couple of months ago,
- Couple months ago.

06:27.006 --> 06:29.006
- And we were going out for her birthday...
- Your birthday.

06:29.008 --> 06:30.374
- No, her birthday.
- Her birthday, right.

06:30.376 --> 06:31.408
Okay, please let me tell the story.

06:31.410 --> 06:32.943
Okay, please, go ahead.

06:32.945 --> 06:35.112
Thanks for taking me out on my birthday.

06:35.114 --> 06:36.813
Well, I'm sorry it doesn't
beat your tenth birthday

06:36.815 --> 06:39.049
when we went to the New
Kids on the Block concert.

06:39.051 --> 06:42.452
Uh, yeah! I still can't believe
I caught Joey Mclntyre's sock.

06:42.454 --> 06:44.288
- You found that sock on the ground.
- I caught it.

06:44.290 --> 06:45.689
- It was his sock.
- No.

06:45.691 --> 06:47.491
It can't be a random sock, Allison...

06:47.493 --> 06:49.459
I've kissed it too many times.

06:49.461 --> 06:51.562
I'm sorry Hank forgot your birthday.

06:51.564 --> 06:53.497
Yeah, it's par for the course.

06:53.499 --> 06:54.865
Well, it shouldn't be.

06:58.014 --> 06:59.403
Okay, Kelly, I just have to say this.

06:59.766 --> 07:01.793
There is something off about Hank.

07:01.898 --> 07:03.460
It always seems like he's hiding something.

07:03.513 --> 07:04.308
He doesn't get your sense of humor,

07:04.310 --> 07:06.543
he's not as smart as you are,
and you've said several times

07:06.545 --> 07:07.978
he suffers from premature ejacula...

07:07.980 --> 07:09.546
Surprise!

07:10.583 --> 07:12.149
You didn't let me finish.

07:12.935 --> 07:14.518
Par for the course, by the way.
(chuckles nervously)

07:14.520 --> 07:16.019
No?

07:16.855 --> 07:18.555
Nobody?

07:18.557 --> 07:19.756
I'm so sorry.

07:19.758 --> 07:21.325
Wow.

07:21.327 --> 07:24.130
I tried to apologize to her, but...

07:24.489 --> 07:27.264
I don't think she heard me over
the sound of her own yelling.

07:27.266 --> 07:29.536
- Aw.
- But it's okay, we'll reconnect.

07:29.537 --> 07:30.701
You know, it's been a couple of months...

07:30.703 --> 07:33.003
She's probably cooled off, and,
you know, it's a funny thing

07:33.005 --> 07:33.537
about...

07:33.539 --> 07:34.271
Yah!

07:34.273 --> 07:35.606
How did you do that?

07:35.608 --> 07:37.174
Oh, you think <i>this</i> is impressive...

07:37.176 --> 07:38.542
You should see me catch soup.

07:38.544 --> 07:41.078
- Hey, Dad. Ready to watch the game?
- Yup.

07:41.080 --> 07:43.447
So to clarify...
earlier, when we told Allison

07:43.449 --> 07:44.881
that we were not going to enact revenge...

07:44.883 --> 07:46.850
<i>Huge</i> lie. Yeah, we're not letting Evan

07:46.852 --> 07:49.052
- get away with what he did to Allison.
- Damn straight.

07:49.054 --> 07:51.221
Just wanted to make sure
we were on the same page.

07:51.223 --> 07:52.489
Don't get mad, get Evan.

07:52.491 --> 07:54.057
To quote the ultimate daughter avenger,

07:54.059 --> 07:56.226
- Liam Neeson...
- Give it to me.

07:56.228 --> 07:58.395
(like Neeson):
I have a very special set of skills

07:58.397 --> 08:01.131
that makes me a nightmare
for people like Evan.

08:01.133 --> 08:03.133
Never saw those movies.
But I feel like I get it.

08:03.135 --> 08:05.569
So what's our plan?
'Cause we have to make sure it's

08:05.571 --> 08:07.070
just the right level
of getting back at him.

08:07.072 --> 08:08.305
That's true... We've had difficulty

08:08.307 --> 08:09.539
in the past with Allison's exes.

08:09.541 --> 08:11.008
Sometimes we take it too far.

08:12.911 --> 08:15.912
Sometimes I feel like we've
left a little bit on the table.

08:17.816 --> 08:19.916
- (whispers): It's been an issue.
- All right,

08:19.918 --> 08:22.586
it says on Facebook
he's playing his ukulele

08:22.588 --> 08:24.388
at an open mic on Friday.

08:24.390 --> 08:25.622
- Are you thinking what I'm thinking?
- Mm-hmm.

08:25.624 --> 08:26.823
- Burn down that building.
- Heckle him.

08:26.825 --> 08:27.958
With our heckling.

08:27.960 --> 08:29.259
Sometimes you go too far, son.

08:29.261 --> 08:30.327
I know.

08:30.329 --> 08:31.695
(doorbell rings)

08:32.998 --> 08:34.498
(horn blasts)

08:35.366 --> 08:38.602
(goofy laughing)

08:38.604 --> 08:41.905
(chuckles) Allison, it's me!

08:41.907 --> 08:43.273
I'm just kidding.

08:43.275 --> 08:44.975
Amy! Ta-da!

08:44.977 --> 08:48.078
What are you doing here,
and why are you dressed as a clown?

08:48.080 --> 08:49.880
You told me last night
you were afraid of clowns,

08:49.882 --> 08:51.548
and the only way to get over your fears

08:51.550 --> 08:53.283
- is to face 'em head-on.
- Okay,

08:53.285 --> 08:55.585
we need to have a
conversation about boundaries.

08:55.587 --> 08:58.555
(mock gasp) Can we have that
conversation over brunch?

08:58.557 --> 09:00.023
You know,
where we each order different things,

09:00.025 --> 09:01.825
and then we eat off each other's plates.

09:01.827 --> 09:03.126
I know the perfect café.

09:03.128 --> 09:04.428
Not going to brunch with a clown.

09:04.430 --> 09:05.896
Oh, you won't eat with clowns, huh?

09:05.898 --> 09:07.497
Where was that rule when
you were dating Evan?

09:07.499 --> 09:08.865
(horn blasts)

09:09.856 --> 09:11.435
So come on, admit it,

09:11.437 --> 09:13.637
you're less afraid of clowns, right?

09:13.639 --> 09:14.671
(groans)

09:14.673 --> 09:16.273
(chuckles) What is that, vodka?

09:16.275 --> 09:18.108
Oh, my God, that's Kelly.

09:18.110 --> 09:20.210
That's the friend I was
telling you about last night.

09:20.212 --> 09:21.345
Oh, my goodness.

09:21.347 --> 09:23.013
Is it just a coinky-dink

09:23.015 --> 09:24.848
or is somebody pulling the strings?

09:24.850 --> 09:28.518
(singing circus music)

09:28.520 --> 09:32.089
Okay, now I'm afraid of puppets. Yeah.

09:37.419 --> 09:39.514
Does your guardian angel take care of you,
or what?

09:39.567 --> 09:41.435
Look, you get to conquer your
fear of running into Kelly.

09:41.477 --> 09:42.684
- How did you...?
- I don't know.

09:42.685 --> 09:43.982
Did I telepathically convince her

09:44.035 --> 09:46.627
to come to this very café<i> this</i> morning?

09:46.629 --> 09:47.894
You checked her Instagram. She posted

09:47.896 --> 09:49.029
a photo of her French toast, like,

09:49.031 --> 09:50.864
- 30 minutes ago.
- And how can I do that?

09:50.866 --> 09:52.399
When I've been banned from Instagram

09:52.401 --> 09:54.901
for creating the hashtag
BodyPartOrDeliMeat?

09:55.001 --> 09:56.024
Go talk to her.

09:56.056 --> 09:57.871
Okay, just let me lay out the pros and cons

09:57.873 --> 09:59.606
of talking to her versus leaving her alone.

09:59.608 --> 10:01.041
Good plan, good plan.

10:01.043 --> 10:02.976
Or: Kelly, Kelly, Kelly!

10:06.592 --> 10:07.514
Allison?

10:07.516 --> 10:09.316
Hi!

10:09.874 --> 10:12.152
It's been... way too long. (chuckles)

10:12.154 --> 10:13.287
How are you?

10:13.289 --> 10:14.921
Good. Good.

10:14.923 --> 10:16.023
A-Are you still with...

10:16.025 --> 10:17.824
The guy who's hiding something? Yes.

10:17.826 --> 10:19.026
Not the words I would have used.

10:19.028 --> 10:21.261
Oh, exactly the words you did use.

10:21.263 --> 10:23.430
Yeah, about that, um...

10:23.432 --> 10:25.866
Look, I-I should get back to this.

10:25.868 --> 10:28.368
My gallery has an opening on Friday,
so I'm a little swamped.

10:28.370 --> 10:30.871
Sure. Yeah. Well, good luck, Friday.

10:30.873 --> 10:32.639
And, uh, give my best to Hank.

10:32.641 --> 10:33.907
I will not.

10:33.909 --> 10:35.809
Good one. Seriously.

10:35.811 --> 10:37.247
Miss this.

10:37.946 --> 10:39.432
Got to run.

10:40.973 --> 10:42.015
Brad: <i>Dad,</i>

10:42.017 --> 10:43.483
I'm assembling the ultimate heckle kit

10:43.485 --> 10:45.018
for tonight. Yeah. I-I...

10:45.020 --> 10:46.453
All I need is an embarrassing photo of Evan

10:46.455 --> 10:47.854
that we can blow up.

10:47.856 --> 10:49.923
I got the one of him in the tighty-whities.

10:51.388 --> 10:52.793
Oh. Okay, I got to go.

10:54.987 --> 10:57.698
Hey. What's going on?

10:57.700 --> 10:58.765
Oh, just another

10:58.767 --> 11:00.434
bad run-in with Kelly.

11:00.436 --> 11:01.868
She's still really ticked off at me.

11:01.870 --> 11:03.103
Really?

11:03.105 --> 11:04.838
Still? Sorry to hear that.

11:04.840 --> 11:07.207
She's a good one.

11:07.209 --> 11:09.176
Yup. How you holding up?

11:09.178 --> 11:12.012
Um, I'm fine. Why are you dancing?

11:12.014 --> 11:13.947
Mm...

11:13.949 --> 11:15.749
What's in the shopping bag, Brad?

11:15.751 --> 11:16.983
This old bag?

11:16.985 --> 11:18.785
Nothing. I just, you know...

11:18.787 --> 11:20.721
As a thank-you for letting
me stay in the guesthouse,

11:20.723 --> 11:22.556
I thought I'd help out
with the grocery shopping,

11:22.558 --> 11:24.691
picking up a little deodorant
for the both of us, you know.

11:24.693 --> 11:26.126
(loud honk) Ooh.

11:26.128 --> 11:28.061
(loud honk)

11:28.063 --> 11:29.963
Loud enough for a man, pH-balanced for a...

11:29.965 --> 11:32.165
Okay, that's an air horn.

11:34.536 --> 11:36.503
So, back on Kelly...

11:36.505 --> 11:39.706
I think I need to go big
to fix the situation.

11:39.708 --> 11:41.375
What are you saying, Allison?

11:41.377 --> 11:43.043
I'm calling in my chit.

11:43.045 --> 11:45.312
Are you sure?

11:45.314 --> 11:47.514
'Cause I can only make this call once.

11:47.516 --> 11:49.116
Just because I sold him his house

11:49.118 --> 11:50.617
doesn't mean he'll say yes.

11:50.619 --> 11:52.319
Make the call.

11:52.321 --> 11:55.155
Thank you so much for meeting with me,
Joey Mclntyre.

11:55.157 --> 11:57.190
No worries.
Brad told me you cashed in your chit.

11:57.192 --> 11:58.792
I give everybody one.

11:58.794 --> 12:00.694
I'm just glad you're
not one of the crazies.

12:00.696 --> 12:02.729
(laughs) Yeah, right? No, I was a...

12:02.731 --> 12:05.198
I was a casual New Kids fan,
not one of the crazy ones,

12:05.200 --> 12:07.067
you know, Joey Mclntyre.

12:07.069 --> 12:10.537
Can you... not use my full name?

12:10.539 --> 12:12.806
Oh, you got it, Joey. (mouths)

12:12.808 --> 12:15.642
Uh, okay,
so tell me about this girl, Kelly.

12:15.644 --> 12:18.211
How old is she, what disease does she have?

12:18.213 --> 12:20.580
She's 32, and she tested positive for being

12:20.582 --> 12:22.883
super mad at me, and the doctors prescribed

12:22.885 --> 12:24.785
a round of J-Mac Z-Pak.

12:24.787 --> 12:26.420
Candy corn. Candy corn.

12:26.422 --> 12:27.854
We have a candy corn situation

12:27.856 --> 12:30.190
in the conference room.
I repeat... candy corn.

12:30.192 --> 12:32.759
No, no, no, no, no.
I am not candy corn. I am not. I am

12:32.761 --> 12:34.261
a perfectly balanced dermatologist

12:34.263 --> 12:36.630
who just needs help winning back a friend.

12:36.632 --> 12:37.964
Are you really a dermatologist?

12:37.966 --> 12:40.767
Yes. My father and I have
a very successful practice.

12:40.769 --> 12:43.036
- Do you do tattoo removals?
- Of course.

12:44.406 --> 12:46.006
Circus peanuts. I repeat...

12:46.008 --> 12:47.641
circus peanuts. Stand down.

12:47.643 --> 12:50.477
I too have a mistake that needs fixing.

12:51.713 --> 12:53.713
I need the room.

12:57.419 --> 12:59.853
It was the summer of 1990.

13:00.573 --> 13:02.088
A magical time.

13:02.090 --> 13:03.223
You remember.

13:03.225 --> 13:04.291
I do.

13:04.293 --> 13:06.560
I was on lunch boxes, T-shirts,

13:06.562 --> 13:09.796
bedsheets, trading cards, even had

13:09.798 --> 13:11.731
my own Saturday morning cartoon.

13:11.733 --> 13:13.099
It was hilarious.

13:13.101 --> 13:14.734
The only place my face wasn't appearing

13:14.736 --> 13:16.102
was on my body.

13:16.619 --> 13:17.370
Until this.

13:17.372 --> 13:18.805
♪ Yeah ♪

13:18.807 --> 13:20.106
Oh, my God, it's happening.

13:20.108 --> 13:22.142
Just be cool. Let it play out.

13:25.558 --> 13:26.561
I haven't done anything

13:26.603 --> 13:28.281
about it because I didn't
want word to get out.

13:29.218 --> 13:31.184
You help me get rid of him,

13:31.627 --> 13:32.886
I'll do the appearance.

13:32.888 --> 13:34.254
Done.

13:35.791 --> 13:38.144
Woman (gasps): Oh, my God, a giant spider!

13:40.295 --> 13:42.996
(gasps) Spider! Spider!

13:43.599 --> 13:44.998
(grunts)

13:45.000 --> 13:46.333
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!

13:46.335 --> 13:48.001
Don't...

13:48.003 --> 13:51.471
be so cute?

13:51.473 --> 13:53.106
Congratulations. Boom...

13:53.108 --> 13:55.308
You just conquered your fear of spiders.
Oh!

13:55.310 --> 13:57.444
Hey, and you helped, you little guy.

13:57.446 --> 13:59.913
Yes, you did. Oh, you're a good fear.

13:59.915 --> 14:01.515
Good fear.

14:01.517 --> 14:03.383
So how was the meeting with Joey Mac?

14:03.385 --> 14:05.285
How did you...?

14:05.287 --> 14:07.254
You can't keep popping up in my life.

14:07.256 --> 14:09.055
Well, as a professional pimple popper

14:09.057 --> 14:10.690
I thought you'd appreciate that.
Oh, I'm sorry,

14:10.692 --> 14:12.993
you got some of my friendly fire.
Lot of Ps.

14:12.995 --> 14:14.494
You have to give me some space.

14:14.496 --> 14:16.263
Wh... Space? Well, I'm barely in your life.

14:16.265 --> 14:17.764
I haven't even met your family yet.

14:17.766 --> 14:19.132
Yeah, and, again... Not gonna happen.

14:19.134 --> 14:20.667
Oh, listen, I know you're not convinced

14:20.669 --> 14:22.202
that I'm an angel.

14:22.204 --> 14:24.971
I am more convinced that
that dog is a spider.

14:24.973 --> 14:26.473
(whimpers)

14:26.475 --> 14:28.975
Okay, I know I said we could be friends,

14:28.977 --> 14:32.012
but friends take breaks
in between hangouts.

14:32.014 --> 14:34.214
Oh. Okay, well, I've never heard of that,

14:34.216 --> 14:35.549
but that's fine, take your space.

14:35.551 --> 14:37.817
There's my bus anyway. Okay?

14:42.124 --> 14:43.623
Sorry, ma'am. No pets.

14:43.625 --> 14:45.425
Uh, it's a service spider.

14:46.662 --> 14:48.895
I can't wait to tear Evan a brand-new one

14:48.897 --> 14:50.196
and completely ignore
the two-drink minimum.

14:50.198 --> 14:52.165
Yeah, they're not getting our money.

14:52.167 --> 14:54.601
Although the wait staff isn't to
blame for Evan's infidelities.

14:54.603 --> 14:55.835
Excellent point.

14:55.837 --> 14:57.337
Okay. Two gin and Frescas.

14:57.339 --> 14:58.605
Shaken, not laughed at.

14:58.607 --> 15:00.540
(applause) Here he is.

15:01.743 --> 15:03.777
Let's get our heckle on.

15:03.779 --> 15:05.946
Thanks for, uh, coming out tonight.

15:05.948 --> 15:08.348
This is a new song that I wrote.

15:08.350 --> 15:09.716
It's about loss.

Just don't let him date your daughter.

16:05.040 --> 16:08.074
Kelly. Congratulations on the show.

16:08.076 --> 16:09.075
It's fantastic.

16:09.077 --> 16:10.710
Hi. What are you doing here?

16:10.712 --> 16:12.612
Hi. So I know I screwed up really bad

16:12.614 --> 16:14.314
and I really want to make it up to you.

16:14.316 --> 16:17.050
So... I got you something.

16:17.052 --> 16:20.720
Okay. Well,
tonight's a really big night for me, so...

16:20.722 --> 16:24.591
It is. But it's about to get bigger.

16:24.593 --> 16:26.259
(tapping) Ladies and gentlemen,

16:26.261 --> 16:28.795
if I may have your attention, please.

16:28.797 --> 16:30.964
(exhales)

16:30.966 --> 16:33.133
Kelly, I, uh, I know

16:33.135 --> 16:35.135
we're in the middle of your big night,

16:35.137 --> 16:37.003
but, uh, I felt like this just

16:37.005 --> 16:38.938
couldn't wait.

16:38.940 --> 16:41.007
Oh. (giggles softly)

16:41.009 --> 16:42.175
Kelly, we have

16:42.177 --> 16:43.610
been together for two

16:43.612 --> 16:45.111
amazing years.

16:45.113 --> 16:46.713
(music starts playing)

16:50.152 --> 16:52.052
Kelly. What up, girl?

16:52.054 --> 16:53.853
I'm here because your friend once ruined

16:53.855 --> 16:55.855
what should have been a very special moment

16:55.857 --> 16:57.524
with your boyfriend. She wants you to know

16:57.526 --> 17:00.293
she's sorry and that
it'll never happen again.

17:02.631 --> 17:05.065
Oh, God, it's, uh,
happening again right now.

17:05.067 --> 17:07.233
Good night, Los Angeles.

17:09.371 --> 17:11.304
You guys, I am so sorry...

17:11.306 --> 17:12.439
Allison, just stop it.

17:12.441 --> 17:13.807
You're like a guided missile

17:13.809 --> 17:16.041
set to destroy every milestone

17:16.044 --> 17:17.510
in our relationship.

17:17.512 --> 17:19.179
And for your information,

17:19.181 --> 17:21.848
I'm a much more attentive
lover than I used to be.

17:21.849 --> 17:23.616
Oh.

17:23.617 --> 17:25.117
Anyway, where was I? Um,

17:25.119 --> 17:26.752
sweetheart... (giggles)

17:26.755 --> 17:28.621
Look, I'm sorry,
I really just didn't know...

17:28.623 --> 17:31.357
Oh, my God,
can I please finish my proposal?!

17:31.359 --> 17:33.226
Just go, Allison.

17:34.963 --> 17:36.329
Kelly...

17:36.331 --> 17:39.499
Uh, just-just get up, Hank, it's over.

17:39.501 --> 17:40.700
I'll marry you.

17:40.702 --> 17:42.135
Thank you. I love you.

17:42.137 --> 17:43.703
Hooray.

17:43.705 --> 17:45.171
(scattered applause)

17:49.927 --> 17:52.594
- I heard about last night.
- How?

17:52.596 --> 17:55.531
I work in the art world as
a part-time full-nude model.

17:55.533 --> 17:57.232
I am such an idiot.

17:57.234 --> 17:59.768
I don't know why I had to
go so big with my apology.

17:59.770 --> 18:03.238
I do. Your biggest fear isn't clowns,
spiders or Kelly.

18:04.141 --> 18:05.769
It's being alone.

18:06.403 --> 18:09.478
Listen, kid, I know you probably
feel like a lot of people

18:09.480 --> 18:12.714
have left you recently,
what with your mom passing away

18:12.716 --> 18:15.584
and that fiasco with Evan and Jill,

18:15.586 --> 18:17.052
and maybe now you're thinking that

18:17.054 --> 18:18.987
it's happening again with Kelly.

18:18.989 --> 18:20.864
- Wow.
- Aw.

18:21.645 --> 18:23.397
Are you crying?

18:23.928 --> 18:27.280
Because we get bonuses for epiphany tears.

18:27.898 --> 18:30.032
I guess I have been feeling really alone.

18:30.034 --> 18:31.333
And that's why you've been
doing everything in your power

18:31.335 --> 18:32.501
to make it up to Kelly,

18:32.503 --> 18:34.169
when all you have to do is sit down

18:34.171 --> 18:36.605
with her, give her a straightforward,

18:36.607 --> 18:38.574
honest apology.

18:39.291 --> 18:40.535
Even if that means

18:40.599 --> 18:42.311
she's not gonna be your friend anymore.

18:42.313 --> 18:43.679
Maybe you're right.

18:43.681 --> 18:45.454
You know who else would agree with me?

18:45.728 --> 18:47.583
Your dead mother.

18:47.585 --> 18:49.218
I am not going to cry for you.

18:49.220 --> 18:50.285
Smart girl.

18:50.287 --> 18:51.353
Save it for your friend.

18:51.355 --> 18:53.055
Kelly, Kelly, Kelly!

18:53.057 --> 18:55.591
Oh, my gosh, is that another coincidence?

18:55.593 --> 18:57.359
You got to be kidding me.

18:57.361 --> 18:59.261
You're the anonymous buyer?

18:59.263 --> 19:00.529
Yeah.

19:00.531 --> 19:02.671
Yeah. Yeah, that's me.

19:02.809 --> 19:04.333
I'm the buyer.

19:04.846 --> 19:07.136
I guess we're, uh... we're going live.

19:07.138 --> 19:08.737
Okay. I know

19:08.739 --> 19:11.340
I screwed up majorly.

19:11.342 --> 19:14.343
Not just with the
birthday and the proposal,

19:14.345 --> 19:16.077
but as your friend.

19:18.282 --> 19:19.781
You were the first person

19:19.783 --> 19:23.118
I cared about outside of my family, and

19:23.120 --> 19:25.787
at the risk of you telling me off,

19:25.789 --> 19:28.357
I want to make it up to
you in every way I can.

19:29.090 --> 19:31.927
'Cause I really don't want
to lose your friendship.

19:32.549 --> 19:35.063
Well...

19:35.398 --> 19:38.534
buying a $5,000 photograph
is a good way to start.

19:38.536 --> 19:40.369
$5,000... (nervous chuckle)

19:41.245 --> 19:43.438
Yeah, yeah.

19:43.440 --> 19:45.574
That's a good way to start.

19:46.770 --> 19:48.177
The clown photo?

19:48.179 --> 19:49.611
The clown!

19:52.516 --> 19:55.117
Hey, Amy.

19:55.119 --> 19:57.022
So, how'd it go with Kelly?

19:57.476 --> 19:59.288
She asked me to be a bridesmaid.

19:59.290 --> 20:01.757
Oh, I'm so sorry.

20:01.759 --> 20:03.559
What? No, it's a good thing.

20:03.561 --> 20:05.761
No, it's really not.
I saw the dresses she picked out...

20:05.763 --> 20:07.796
You're gonna look like a big ol'
fuchsia berry up there.

20:07.798 --> 20:09.464
Oh, well, thanks for the warning.

20:09.466 --> 20:10.699
Mm.

20:11.134 --> 20:12.668
And thank you for everything else.

20:12.670 --> 20:13.902
You're welcome.

20:13.904 --> 20:15.137
Are you starting to understand

20:15.139 --> 20:16.605
why you need a guardian angel?

20:16.607 --> 20:18.774
No, but I am starting to see

20:18.776 --> 20:21.009
the upside of having a weird friend.

20:21.011 --> 20:23.045
Oh. And this weird friend

20:23.047 --> 20:25.842
is learning how to give you your space.
(clicks tongue)

20:27.573 --> 20:31.019
Amy? Yeah?

20:31.021 --> 20:33.088
Would you like to have
lunch with me and my brother

20:33.090 --> 20:34.356
sometime next week?

20:34.358 --> 20:36.291
Mm-hmm.

20:36.293 --> 20:38.026
Yeah, I think I could make that work.

20:38.028 --> 20:40.062
Great. I'll see you then.

20:45.402 --> 20:47.569
I'm gonna meet the fam.

20:49.106 --> 20:50.093
Oh.

20:52.499 --> 20:54.713
That doesn't count, I'm off the clock.
