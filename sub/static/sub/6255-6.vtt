WEBVTT

00:02.387 --> 00:04.388
The musicians will wait
for my signal,

00:04.422 --> 00:05.656
then once everyone's set...

00:05.689 --> 00:06.623
Oh, my God!

00:06.658 --> 00:08.058
Angie, it's just
a rehearsal.

00:08.092 --> 00:09.893
You can't keep crying.
I can and I will.

00:09.928 --> 00:11.395
We only have
the church till 11:00.

00:11.429 --> 00:12.563
Can you cry after 11:00?

00:12.597 --> 00:13.764
Can't forget
the best man.

00:13.798 --> 00:15.098
No, he'll be dressed on the day.

00:15.133 --> 00:16.633
My son's flying
in later. So. hey...

00:16.668 --> 00:17.734
That's my dad.

00:17.769 --> 00:19.303
This isn't really necessary.

00:19.337 --> 00:21.572
This is just to get
a general idea...

00:21.606 --> 00:23.507
He isn't very dependable,
but I imagine

00:23.541 --> 00:24.708
my father will be here.

00:24.742 --> 00:25.742
I'm sure.

00:25.777 --> 00:27.511
How can you be sure?
He's just being nice.

00:27.545 --> 00:29.513
Don't worry, Bones.
Max will be here, all right?

00:29.547 --> 00:30.981
Ju... Can we hurry
this along?

00:31.015 --> 00:33.717
I <i>have</i> been trying.
Okay, then, after opening rites,

00:33.751 --> 00:35.552
we have the first reading.
Dr. Hodgins?

00:35.587 --> 00:37.254
Got some stuff from Ecclesiastes
that's gonna kill.

00:37.288 --> 00:39.222
Oh, I'm sorry.

00:39.257 --> 00:40.757
Uh, no problem.

00:40.792 --> 00:43.760
Uh, then after your reading,
Dr. Sweets will...

00:43.795 --> 00:45.228
Oh, God.

00:45.263 --> 00:46.930
I'm sorry.
Don't worry. God grants me

00:46.965 --> 00:49.366
patience for just such events.

00:49.400 --> 00:51.435
No, no, Bones, don't even
pick it up. Shut it off.

00:51.469 --> 00:53.036
Just put it away.
Put it away.

00:53.071 --> 00:54.204
Oh...
Put it away.

00:54.238 --> 00:55.505
No...
Oh, I'm sorry.

00:55.540 --> 00:57.608
Am I allowed to kiss him now?

00:57.642 --> 00:59.610
It's really just a rehearsal,
Dr. Brennan.

00:59.644 --> 01:01.511
Because we are sleeping
together.

01:01.546 --> 01:02.813
No. Shh...

01:02.847 --> 01:04.414
Sleeping, of course,
is a euphemism for sex.

01:04.449 --> 01:06.016
No. I'm really sorry,
Father.

01:06.050 --> 01:07.124
You don't have to
apologize, Booth.

01:07.125 --> 01:08.249
It's not like he's
going to be jealous.

01:08.274 --> 01:09.486
Don't say sex...

01:09.487 --> 01:12.289
So, moving on, we have
uh, the reading, music,

01:12.323 --> 01:13.857
the homily, blah, blah,

01:13.891 --> 01:15.525
and then your father will...

01:15.560 --> 01:17.527
Oh, gosh,
I-I'm sorry. Sorry.

01:17.562 --> 01:20.097
I thought I turned
it off. Sorry.

01:20.131 --> 01:22.032
That will not happen again.

01:23.768 --> 01:25.902
Yeah.
Okay.

01:25.937 --> 01:29.039
Okay, then. Here we go.

01:34.112 --> 01:36.279
Excuse me.

01:36.314 --> 01:37.814
Yes?

01:37.849 --> 01:41.018
No, I do last rites,
but I don't do murder.

01:41.052 --> 01:42.786
It's for you.

01:42.820 --> 01:44.321
Me?
Yeah.

01:44.355 --> 01:47.357
Sorry. This will just take
one... Booth.

01:47.392 --> 01:49.726
Booth...

01:49.761 --> 01:51.595
They found the remains
on the grounds

01:51.629 --> 01:53.730
by a senatorial building,
the one on P Street.

01:53.765 --> 01:55.832
That's where the President
used to stay. - Yep.

01:55.867 --> 01:57.367
They were excavating
for a new gazebo.

01:57.402 --> 01:59.369
The remains are being brought
directly to the lab.

01:59.404 --> 02:02.239
Which will not concern
Dr. Brennan or Agent Booth, will it?

02:02.273 --> 02:03.807
Well, we're not getting married
until tomorrow.

02:03.841 --> 02:05.242
I should really take a look.

02:05.276 --> 02:07.044
Oh, no.

02:07.078 --> 02:09.479
What do you mean, "Oh, no," huh?
Rings, kiss, vows-- hitched.

02:09.514 --> 02:11.148
Are you serious?
Yeah, totally serious.

02:11.182 --> 02:12.883
You know, work is good.
Keep her busy.

02:12.917 --> 02:14.518
Don't worry about it.
Yep, let's go.

02:14.552 --> 02:16.219
See you all
back at the lab.

02:18.222 --> 02:21.224
I'll put $25 on the wedding
being canceled

02:21.259 --> 02:23.193
by lunchtime tomorrow.

02:23.227 --> 02:24.828
Yeah. 50 bucks says
it's canceled

02:24.862 --> 02:26.363
before the sun goes down.

02:26.397 --> 02:28.098
Worst friends ever.

02:30.168 --> 02:31.868
The victim is female, mid-30s.

02:31.903 --> 02:34.204
Almost completely skeletonized.

02:34.238 --> 02:36.139
Remaining tissue is desiccated.

02:36.174 --> 02:38.875
This happened
a long time ago.

02:38.910 --> 02:40.811
Multiple stab wounds
to the chest;

02:40.845 --> 02:42.946
degree of staining on the
clothes suggests she bled out.

02:42.980 --> 02:45.749
Fabric-wise, it looks like
the victim died in the '70s.

02:45.783 --> 02:47.818
1979, to be precise.

02:47.852 --> 02:49.720
That's impossible
to know at this stage.

02:49.754 --> 02:52.889
Afraid not. Cicada.
It was caught in her sleeve.

02:52.924 --> 02:54.858
They only emerge
once every 17 years,

02:54.892 --> 02:56.626
meaning our victim was killed
in 1979.

02:56.661 --> 03:00.330
Or I guess, 1945,
or 1962, 1996.

03:00.364 --> 03:03.300
Okay, we get the point.
1979 it is.

03:03.334 --> 03:05.135
You see, Brennan?
This is gonna solve itself.

03:05.169 --> 03:06.503
You are not needed.

03:06.537 --> 03:07.938
And since the wedding is
tomorrow, you should get

03:07.972 --> 03:08.839
your beauty sleep.

03:08.873 --> 03:10.240
I don't need sleep
to be beautiful.

03:10.274 --> 03:11.842
No, but it does help you
be pleasant.

03:11.876 --> 03:14.311
We have this under control,
Dr. Brennan.

03:14.345 --> 03:16.246
Angela, can you take this
paperwork

03:16.280 --> 03:18.115
and see what you can restore?
Got it.

03:18.149 --> 03:19.950
No one here is a forensic
anthropologist.

03:19.984 --> 03:21.918
Without me, you won't
be able to...

03:21.953 --> 03:23.787
Dr. Brennan, what
are you doing here?

03:23.821 --> 03:25.255
What are <i>you</i> doing here?

03:25.289 --> 03:29.326
I asked him to come because you
have your mani-pedi appointment.

03:29.360 --> 03:31.328
I can't, in good conscience,
leave until I feel confident

03:31.362 --> 03:33.096
you are capable of
handling the case.

03:33.131 --> 03:35.332
I'm gonna chalk that up
to nerves and not be insulted.

03:35.366 --> 03:36.833
Good call.

03:36.868 --> 03:41.304
Would you just stop acting
like the wedding is doomed?

03:41.339 --> 03:42.639
Brennan really
wants this.

03:42.673 --> 03:43.940
Then why are we here?

03:43.975 --> 03:46.510
I mean, this case is
over 30 years old.

03:46.544 --> 03:47.844
It could wait till Monday.

03:47.879 --> 03:49.112
Hey, look at this.

03:49.147 --> 03:50.781
What is that,
a protective sleeve?

03:50.815 --> 03:54.351
Yeah, for, like, a photograph
or an important document.

03:54.385 --> 03:55.752
Yeah, but it's empty.

03:55.787 --> 03:57.454
Ooh, hey, I found it.

03:57.488 --> 03:59.723
Her I.D.
Laminated. That's helpful.

03:59.757 --> 04:03.426
Nancy Handelman.
She was born February 5, 1943,

04:03.461 --> 04:05.162
which makes her 36
when she died.

04:05.196 --> 04:06.429
Poor thing.

04:06.464 --> 04:09.499
Listen, Brennan's
just nervous, okay?

04:09.534 --> 04:10.600
It happens.

04:10.635 --> 04:12.335
But we have to
support her.

04:12.370 --> 04:14.104
We have to stay positive.

04:14.138 --> 04:15.438
I will be as positive

04:15.473 --> 04:18.375
as a proton,
I promise.

04:18.409 --> 04:20.277
I got your text
about the wedding pool.

04:20.310 --> 04:23.346
ll p $50 on it being
called off by 3:00.

04:23.381 --> 04:25.115
Yes.

04:27.118 --> 04:29.085
They'll call
if they find anything,

04:29.120 --> 04:30.887
so just get home, okay, Bones?

04:30.922 --> 04:34.191
I think your dad is here.
His stuff is on the counter.

04:34.225 --> 04:35.692
I told you he'd make it.

04:35.726 --> 04:38.528
All right, hurry back.
I love you, too.

04:38.563 --> 04:39.830
Hey, Max, are you hungry?!

04:39.864 --> 04:42.566
Bones is gonna go pick up
Christine and...

04:42.600 --> 04:44.634
Oh!

04:44.669 --> 04:47.470
Looks like I'm gonna
need a new bag.

04:48.639 --> 04:50.307

05:22.391 --> 05:23.917
I mean, I think
it's very generous.

05:24.063 --> 05:25.464
You know, it's tradition
for the father

05:25.498 --> 05:27.299
of the bride to pay
for the wedding.

05:27.333 --> 05:28.567
Max is obviously
a traditionalist.

05:28.601 --> 05:29.701
Okay, did you hear me?

05:29.736 --> 05:31.403
The bag looked
like it was buried.

05:31.438 --> 05:32.571
Maybe it's just dirty.

05:32.605 --> 05:34.072
Oh, come on, Sweets.

05:34.107 --> 05:36.787
Look, I'd advise you to just
concentrate on the wedding.

05:36.965 --> 05:38.732
How's Dr. Brennan doing?
Okay, look,

05:38.766 --> 05:40.067
this is the area
where the body

05:40.101 --> 05:41.401
was found, right?
Up in that one.

05:41.436 --> 05:42.736
You're really gonna
duck the question

05:42.770 --> 05:44.905
by hiding behind your work?
Okay. Used to be part

05:44.939 --> 05:47.274
of Adams University.
It was sold off ten years ago.

05:47.308 --> 05:48.345
What are those buildings?

05:48.370 --> 05:49.443
Grad student housing
and faculty offices.

05:49.444 --> 05:52.779
I'm gonna do a background check
on all the tenants from 1979.

05:52.814 --> 05:56.617
And you know what? I am not
hiding behind my work, okay?

05:56.651 --> 05:59.353
I'm just trying to keep Bones
busy so she doesn't get nervous.

05:59.387 --> 06:00.954
And get cold feet.

06:00.989 --> 06:02.556
Listen, Bones doesn't
have cold feet, all right?

06:02.590 --> 06:03.824
Actually, they're warm.
Actually, they're

06:03.858 --> 06:05.192
very hot, thank you
very much.

06:05.226 --> 06:06.426
I'm on your side, okay?

06:06.461 --> 06:07.861
And I think what you're
doing is great psychology.

06:07.896 --> 06:09.463
As far as the bag
full of money,

06:09.497 --> 06:12.299
you're right,
it's-it's kind of creepy.

06:12.333 --> 06:14.134
Go do something else
somewhere else.

06:14.169 --> 06:16.470
Okay. Thank you.

06:18.740 --> 06:20.941
Dr. Hodgins,
what have you got for me?

06:20.975 --> 06:22.376
Brennan's done
with her mani-pedi.

06:22.410 --> 06:24.211
I meant...
Right. Sorry, sorry.

06:24.245 --> 06:26.180
Today, all I seem
to think about...

06:26.214 --> 06:27.581
The wedding pool.

06:27.615 --> 06:30.417
Wh... No. What kind of a
person do you think I am?

06:30.451 --> 06:32.653
That was rhetorical.

06:32.687 --> 06:35.155
All right, these are the results
from the stab wounds.

06:35.190 --> 06:38.058
Now, traces
of iron-carbon alloy.

06:38.092 --> 06:39.826
So the weapon
was made of steel.

06:39.861 --> 06:41.628
Yeah. Also, I got some
particulate residue

06:41.663 --> 06:43.997
from multiple insect
and foliage species.

06:44.032 --> 06:45.499
Inside the wounds?

06:45.533 --> 06:47.968
That's odd, especially
in an urban area.

06:48.002 --> 06:50.003
Still working on trying to I.D.
the various species.

06:50.038 --> 06:51.138
Is that our victim?

06:51.172 --> 06:53.173
Booth just e-mailed me
her file.

06:53.208 --> 06:56.343
Nancy Handelman was single,
no living family,

06:56.377 --> 06:57.711
worked at the Library
of Congress

06:57.745 --> 06:58.812
in the Manuscripts Division.

06:58.846 --> 07:00.480
The Manuscripts Division?

07:00.515 --> 07:02.249
Maybe that acid-free sleeve
she was carrying

07:02.283 --> 07:04.084
<i>did</i> contain something
important,

07:04.118 --> 07:07.354
like the letter that Nixon wrote
confirming the presence of aliens,

07:07.388 --> 07:08.755
or even a map that reveals...

07:08.790 --> 07:09.990
Slow down, Da Vinci Code.

07:10.024 --> 07:11.925
As far as we know, she was just
a simple librarian.

07:11.960 --> 07:14.328
I know what you're up to.

07:14.362 --> 07:17.030
Yeah, I'm not up to anything.

07:17.065 --> 07:18.999
Okay. If Brennan realizes
the enormity of this case,

07:19.033 --> 07:20.334
she's gonna ditch
the wedding,

07:20.368 --> 07:22.436
so you want me
to keep quiet

07:22.470 --> 07:23.537
until after the nuptials.

07:23.571 --> 07:28.575
Yes, Dr. Hodgins,
nothing gets by you.

07:39.053 --> 07:41.021
Angela told me
not to touch anything,

07:41.055 --> 07:42.723
so can you pick up rib five?

07:42.757 --> 07:45.392
Two minutes with you and I'm
back to being an intern.

07:45.426 --> 07:48.562
Note the peripheral indentation,
as though from a hilt,

07:48.596 --> 07:50.764
so the weapon
could've been short.

07:50.798 --> 07:52.366
Medio-cam, please?

07:52.400 --> 07:55.202
Oh, I guess I should be glad
you're saying "please."

07:55.236 --> 07:57.137
A little more steady,
Dr. Edison.

07:57.171 --> 07:59.873
I have to solve this case
before I consummate my marriage.

07:59.907 --> 08:02.175
A splinter. Dr. Hodgins will
want to see this.

08:02.210 --> 08:03.777
Brennan.

08:03.811 --> 08:05.412
Hair.

08:07.015 --> 08:09.716
You have to get your hair done
for the rehearsal dinner, honey.

08:09.751 --> 08:10.917
No, that makes no sense.

08:10.952 --> 08:13.453
I have my hair done today
for the rehearsal dinner

08:13.488 --> 08:15.522
and then again tomorrow
for the wedding? Why?

08:15.556 --> 08:16.823
Because you're the bride.

08:16.858 --> 08:18.558
So just accept
and adapt, okay?

08:19.861 --> 08:21.795
Hey.

08:22.864 --> 08:24.831
Did you place a bet
on this wedding?

08:24.866 --> 08:27.534
I prefer not to tell you while
you're wearing your tough face.

08:27.568 --> 08:29.303
Mm-hmm.

08:32.674 --> 08:35.241
Is that the protective sleeve
from the victim's bag?

08:35.275 --> 08:37.878
On the left, yeah.
whatever was in it

08:37.912 --> 08:39.846
might have been the
motive for her murder.

08:39.881 --> 08:42.416
But whatever was in it is
long gone, and without it...

08:42.450 --> 08:43.650
Not necessarily.

08:43.684 --> 08:45.185
This image on the right,

08:45.219 --> 08:47.554
I found that folded up
in the victim's wallet.

08:47.588 --> 08:50.357
It's a photocopy.
See the outline?

08:50.391 --> 08:51.725
Oh, so you think that this

08:51.759 --> 08:53.627
is a photocopy
of what was in there.

08:53.661 --> 08:54.961
I'm still working
on the restoration,

08:54.996 --> 08:57.230
but I'm hoping
to pull something from it.

08:57.265 --> 08:58.899
Dr. Saroyan,
I'm finding

08:58.933 --> 09:01.301
a large number of
micro-fractures on the bones.

09:01.336 --> 09:02.669
Dr. Brennan doesn't
know yet.

09:02.704 --> 09:04.504
She missed them?
Only because you told her

09:04.539 --> 09:05.939
not to touch anything
with those fingernails.

09:05.973 --> 09:08.175
What's the question, Dr. Edison?
If I tell Dr. Brennan

09:08.209 --> 09:10.477
about those fractures,
she's gonna check them out.

09:10.511 --> 09:11.912
These fractures
are gonna take

09:11.946 --> 09:13.814
at least two days
for both me

09:13.848 --> 09:16.516
and Dr. Brennan to catalogue,
and for her to check my work.

09:16.551 --> 09:17.984
The wedding is tomorrow.

09:18.019 --> 09:20.287
Simple.
We don't tell her.

09:20.321 --> 09:22.022
We can't lie to Dr. Brennan.

09:22.056 --> 09:23.757
Normally, I would agree
with that,

09:23.791 --> 09:25.592
but this time
we lie our asses off.

09:25.626 --> 09:27.194
Or we could call in
the reserves.

09:27.228 --> 09:29.329
And that's why
I'm checking with you,

09:29.364 --> 09:31.798
because that would entail
extra costs.

09:31.833 --> 09:34.434
I bet the reserves
would come in for free.

09:34.469 --> 09:36.336
Yes, because they don't have to
really do the work.

09:36.371 --> 09:37.537
Dr. Brennan just has to think

09:37.572 --> 09:39.840
that it's covered.
Tricky.

09:39.874 --> 09:42.008
Yes. Tricky is an excellent
coping mechanism

09:42.043 --> 09:44.411
when dealing with people
like Dr. Brennan.

09:48.049 --> 09:51.051
<i>Dr. Brennan, I thought you'd be</i>
<i>home getting ready.</i>

09:51.085 --> 09:52.586
I'm checking
Dr. Edison's work

09:52.620 --> 09:54.855
so that I can talk to him
before I leave.

09:54.889 --> 09:56.890
Uh, he doesn't
need your help.

09:56.924 --> 09:59.326
How can you say that?

09:59.360 --> 10:01.895
These indentations could
have easily caused

10:01.929 --> 10:03.730
the micro-fractures
to the ribs.

10:03.765 --> 10:07.434
But we don't have a murder weapon
that matches any of these.

10:07.468 --> 10:08.835
Trust me, Dr. Brennan,

10:08.870 --> 10:10.904
Dr. Edison's got
plenty of help.

10:13.441 --> 10:15.175
Where did we get
the budget for this?

10:15.209 --> 10:16.643
That's not your concern.

10:16.677 --> 10:19.613
What is your concern is getting
to that rehearsal dinner.

10:29.424 --> 10:31.425
I owe you one, all of you.

10:32.493 --> 10:35.328
Okay, well done. Thanks, guys.

10:37.532 --> 10:39.833
Though, while you're here,
I do have a few

10:39.867 --> 10:42.369
questions you might be able
to help me with.

10:42.403 --> 10:43.904
Uh, we were told
ten minutes, max.

10:43.938 --> 10:46.139
I have a date.
I have therapy.

10:46.174 --> 10:47.574
I have to go get ready
for the wedding.

10:47.608 --> 10:48.782
Sure, rub it in that
you're dating the boss.

10:48.807 --> 10:51.201
You do know Saroyan's gonna want
to get married now, right?

10:51.202 --> 10:52.302
What?

10:52.313 --> 10:55.615
Does anyone besides me care
about this poor, murdered woman?

10:59.287 --> 11:01.555
Hmm.

11:08.521 --> 11:09.825
Hey.
Hey.

11:10.031 --> 11:11.231
"I see your hands,

11:11.266 --> 11:13.367
"and my body
trembles with memory;

11:13.401 --> 11:15.202
"your touch
is like coarse silk

11:15.236 --> 11:17.605
against my bare skin,
pulling me ever closer."

11:17.639 --> 11:19.106
You can't read that
at my wedding.

11:19.140 --> 11:20.808
There's gonna be kids there.
No, no, no.

11:20.842 --> 11:23.110
It's from Angela.
Oh. Well, that figures.

11:23.144 --> 11:24.612
It's text from
the letter found

11:24.646 --> 11:25.779
on the victim.

11:25.814 --> 11:27.081
Oh.
Yeah.

11:27.115 --> 11:28.549
It's very
erotic.

11:28.583 --> 11:30.117
And the voice is
definitely female.

11:30.151 --> 11:32.119
And there's mention
of her lover's wife.

11:32.153 --> 11:33.921
Well, the librarian...
she was having an affair.

11:33.955 --> 11:36.156
Uh, possibly.
Gives the wife, you know,

11:36.191 --> 11:37.992
a nice, clean motive
to get rid of her.

11:38.026 --> 11:39.560
Right.
But here's the thing:

11:39.594 --> 11:41.795
The language seems antiquated.

11:41.830 --> 11:43.263
And it was found in
one of those sleeves

11:43.298 --> 11:45.065
that you use
for collectibles.

11:45.100 --> 11:47.668
Problem?

11:47.702 --> 11:49.670
It's not Dr. Brennan, is it?
No, no. It's... it's...

11:49.704 --> 11:50.971
It's about Max's money.

11:51.006 --> 11:52.673
Oh. Dirty?

11:52.707 --> 11:54.008
Not from
the dirty bag.

11:54.042 --> 11:55.643
I mean...
illicit money?

11:55.677 --> 11:58.112
I got it. No, okay?
The money is clean.

11:58.146 --> 12:00.047
You seem disappointed.
Because something is off.

12:00.081 --> 12:02.583
You don't carry around
a sack of cash like that.

12:02.617 --> 12:03.917
I mean, not if
you're honest.

12:03.952 --> 12:05.352
Max isn't like
other people.

12:05.387 --> 12:06.787
That's what
I'm afraid of.

12:06.821 --> 12:08.522
I don't want a SWAT team
crashing my wedding.

12:08.556 --> 12:10.724
All right, Booth, this is
just your anxiety talking.

12:10.759 --> 12:13.327
All right? You're deflecting
your concerns about your wedding

12:13.361 --> 12:14.595
onto Max.
You're right.

12:14.629 --> 12:15.896
You're actually right.
Because, you know,

12:15.930 --> 12:17.531
he wasn't a fugitive
for all those years.

12:17.565 --> 12:19.033
You know what?
I gotta get out of here.

12:19.067 --> 12:21.669
I'm late. Gotta get to the
airport, pick up my son.

12:23.471 --> 12:25.205
Ooh, tough decision.

12:25.240 --> 12:26.740
Ah, they're both nice.

12:26.775 --> 12:28.815
Now, results from the remaining
particulate samples.

12:28.843 --> 12:30.678
First, the simple part:

12:30.712 --> 12:33.847
that wood splinter inside
the bone was Cocobolo.

12:33.882 --> 12:35.549
It's not indigenous to this
country, so it must be

12:35.583 --> 12:38.052
part of the murder weapon.
Am I wrong to assume

12:38.086 --> 12:39.420
there's also a
not-so-simple part?

12:39.454 --> 12:41.188
The foliage and insect particulates
from inside the wound?

12:41.222 --> 12:42.623
Right?
There weren't just a few.

12:42.657 --> 12:44.625
There were many
different species,

12:44.659 --> 12:45.993
from many different parts
of the country.

12:46.027 --> 12:47.695
You think the body
was moved postmortem?

12:47.729 --> 12:48.929
Unless the killer
moved the body

12:48.963 --> 12:50.631
from Massachusetts
to Georgia

12:50.665 --> 12:51.899
to Virginia, there's got
to be another explanation.

12:51.933 --> 12:53.133
I just don't know
what it is.

12:53.168 --> 12:54.535
Oh, God...

12:54.569 --> 12:56.203
give everything you
have to the interns.

12:56.237 --> 12:57.871
We do not want this hanging
over Dr. Brennan's head

12:57.906 --> 12:59.339
or this wedding
will not happen.

12:59.374 --> 13:00.941
Okay.
All right, uh...

13:00.975 --> 13:03.243
You don't want in on the pool?
No.

13:04.846 --> 13:07.381
Dr. Hodgins?

13:07.415 --> 13:09.450
20 bucks says it's cancelled
by 1:00 tomorrow.

13:11.119 --> 13:12.686
Oh, God, I hate myself.

13:12.721 --> 13:14.588
<i>London is a long flight, okay?</i>

13:14.622 --> 13:15.923
You must
be tired.

13:15.957 --> 13:17.591
I'm fine.

13:17.625 --> 13:19.359
I can't wait till Christine
wakes up from her nap.

13:19.394 --> 13:20.794
Yeah, she's
sleeping, huh?

13:20.829 --> 13:23.530
And if you have to go to work...
No.

13:23.565 --> 13:24.798
I don't have
to go anywhere.

13:24.833 --> 13:26.100
I am exactly

13:26.134 --> 13:27.835
where I want
to be.

13:27.869 --> 13:28.969
Right here with my son.

13:30.638 --> 13:32.740
Boom!

13:32.774 --> 13:35.142
Mom packed my tuxedo.

13:35.176 --> 13:36.977
That's what I'm supposed to wear, right?
Yeah.

13:37.011 --> 13:38.178
You know, we're gonna look like

13:38.213 --> 13:39.613
a bunch of waiters out there.

13:39.647 --> 13:40.848
Or better yet, some penguins

13:40.882 --> 13:42.049
sliding around on the ice.

13:42.083 --> 13:43.383
Huh?
Ah...

13:46.788 --> 13:49.189
I'm glad you're
marrying Bones, you know?

13:49.224 --> 13:50.591
Mom's happy
for you, too.

13:50.625 --> 13:52.559
Thanks.
I'm happy.

13:52.594 --> 13:53.794
I'm happy
you're here.

13:53.828 --> 13:55.395
All right?
So, look,

13:55.430 --> 13:56.997
I have this
list of things

13:57.031 --> 13:58.766
that I need to remember
to get done, all right?

13:58.800 --> 13:59.303
Mm-hmm.

13:59.328 --> 14:00.834
And I need you to make
sure I don't forget.

14:00.835 --> 14:03.003
Me?
Yeah, you.

14:03.037 --> 14:04.404
That's what
a best man does,

14:04.439 --> 14:07.241
and I'm asking you
to be my best man.

14:07.275 --> 14:08.609
Really?

14:08.643 --> 14:10.978
All right?
Thanks, Dad.

14:11.012 --> 14:12.346
I love you.
All right, lookit.

14:12.380 --> 14:13.847
Here's what we gotta get.

14:17.519 --> 14:18.919
This is a hair comb
that I got

14:18.953 --> 14:20.187
in the Marais
in Paris.

14:20.221 --> 14:21.789
These aren't
real jewels

14:21.823 --> 14:24.091
because I couldn't
even afford bread then,

14:24.125 --> 14:25.492
but I...
None of the fractures

14:25.527 --> 14:27.561
on the calcanei
are remodeled.

14:27.595 --> 14:29.129
There are other
fractures...

14:29.164 --> 14:31.365
Okay. I don't care, honey.

14:31.399 --> 14:34.234
I am giving you the
"something borrowed"

14:34.269 --> 14:35.502
that you need.

14:35.537 --> 14:38.105
It's also blue
and old,

14:38.139 --> 14:39.706
so we've got three
out of four down.

14:39.741 --> 14:40.908
I'm sorry.

14:40.942 --> 14:42.342
Thank you.
Have you found

14:42.377 --> 14:44.077
the provenance
of the letter yet?

14:44.112 --> 14:46.647
No, I'm-I'm focusing
on your wedding.

14:46.681 --> 14:48.182
'Cause somebody
has to.

14:49.184 --> 14:51.251
I just want all
the information

14:51.286 --> 14:52.853
in order before
I leave.

14:56.090 --> 14:57.691
Brennan, this is insane.

14:57.725 --> 14:59.426
It's bad enough that
I didn't have time

14:59.460 --> 15:00.928
to throw you
a bachelorette party.

15:00.962 --> 15:02.629
Don't spend your last
few hours working.

15:02.664 --> 15:04.498
Why not?

15:04.532 --> 15:06.500
Because you don't want
your fingers to smell like death

15:06.534 --> 15:07.968
when Booth puts
on the ring.

15:08.002 --> 15:09.236
There's a murder victim.

15:09.270 --> 15:10.537
That is an objective fact.

15:10.572 --> 15:12.105
It's my job to find out
who killed her.

15:12.140 --> 15:14.208
Brennan, she's been
dead for 35 years.

15:14.242 --> 15:16.076
I think she can wait
a little longer.

15:16.110 --> 15:17.211
Hey, hey.

15:17.245 --> 15:18.745
Did you even look

15:18.780 --> 15:20.881
at the hair comb
I gave you?

15:23.117 --> 15:26.253
It meant a lot for me
to give that to you.

15:27.722 --> 15:30.057
My feelings...

15:30.091 --> 15:31.859
they're a jumble...

15:31.893 --> 15:34.194
But this case

15:34.229 --> 15:36.430
is something
I understand.

15:37.632 --> 15:39.833
You understand
happy, right?

15:41.402 --> 15:43.871
Go with that.

15:43.905 --> 15:46.073
One more minute
and I'll leave.

15:46.107 --> 15:48.208
Have you catalogued
all of the injuries?

15:48.243 --> 15:50.310
I've filled one binder so far.
But we're still examining.

15:50.345 --> 15:52.266
There's chipping from an
indeterminate cause which...

15:52.291 --> 15:53.721
You're stating
the obvious, Mr. Fisher.

15:53.722 --> 15:54.548
A high school student
could do that.

15:54.549 --> 15:57.451
The coccyx and sacrum show bruising.
I was going to say that.

15:57.485 --> 15:58.819
Micro-fracture
of the left olecranon.

15:58.853 --> 16:00.020
That, too. I swear.

16:00.054 --> 16:01.321
The perimortem micro-fractures

16:01.356 --> 16:02.556
on the calcaneus bones

16:02.590 --> 16:03.657
indicate repeat
blunt force trauma,

16:03.691 --> 16:05.993
probably from
a flat object

16:06.027 --> 16:07.261
like a 2x4.

16:07.295 --> 16:08.495
Very good,

16:08.529 --> 16:10.130
but you will
not be helping

16:10.164 --> 16:11.798
with the remains
anymore, Dr. Wells.

16:11.833 --> 16:13.834
You have to find
the provenance

16:13.868 --> 16:14.801
of the letter fragment.

16:14.836 --> 16:16.236
I'm doing that.

16:16.271 --> 16:17.504
You have a wedding

16:17.538 --> 16:18.839
to prepare for.

16:18.873 --> 16:20.340
And Dr. Wells
is a polymath

16:20.375 --> 16:22.776
and more than qualified
to do the research.

16:22.810 --> 16:24.711
And if he isn't,
we dismiss him.

16:24.746 --> 16:27.147
No one likes him anyway.
I kind of do.

16:27.181 --> 16:28.701
You're a constant surprise.

16:28.716 --> 16:31.184
If I have to think
about the remains

16:31.219 --> 16:33.186
instead of my wedding,
I will be very unhappy.

16:33.221 --> 16:34.688
You wouldn't want
that, would you?

16:34.722 --> 16:36.423
No, absolutely not.
No. No.

16:36.457 --> 16:37.658
I thought not.

16:37.692 --> 16:39.059
Good luck.

16:39.093 --> 16:42.829
Now I would like
to try on that comb.

16:44.165 --> 16:46.266
We're not even
getting paid.

16:46.301 --> 16:47.634
I am.

16:48.736 --> 16:49.970
You know, I just
thought, look,

16:50.004 --> 16:51.371
you know, before
I get married,

16:51.406 --> 16:52.806
you'd be able to give
me some advice, here.

16:52.840 --> 16:54.207
I'm not a priest
anymore, Booth.

16:54.242 --> 16:55.943
I know. Okay?
I know that.

16:55.977 --> 16:57.818
But the real ones,
they don't know me like you.

16:57.845 --> 16:59.680
We could've done
this at the bar.

16:59.714 --> 17:02.316
Come on, Aldo, will you
just cut me some slack, here?

17:02.350 --> 17:03.317
Okay.

17:03.351 --> 17:05.919
I'm jealous.

17:05.954 --> 17:08.789
What you and
Temperance have,

17:08.823 --> 17:10.958
it's the reason
we draw breath.

17:10.992 --> 17:12.693
You screw
this up,

17:12.727 --> 17:14.994
Booth, and it'll be
worse than any hell

17:15.029 --> 17:16.329
God can dream
up for you.

17:16.364 --> 17:17.830
I agree.

17:17.865 --> 17:20.067
I'm Max.

17:20.101 --> 17:21.702
- I'm Tempe's father.
- Oh...

17:21.736 --> 17:22.836
This guy...

17:22.869 --> 17:25.137
he thinks
I'm still a crook.

17:25.173 --> 17:26.373
Aldo.

17:26.406 --> 17:27.607
He still thinks
I'm a priest.

17:27.642 --> 17:29.876
What are you
doing here, Max?

17:29.911 --> 17:31.878
Well, I saw
you were here,

17:31.913 --> 17:33.213
and I though maybe
you had...

17:33.247 --> 17:34.348
had a change of heart.

17:34.382 --> 17:35.849
So you're
following me?

17:37.285 --> 17:38.518
He's a good father.

17:40.388 --> 17:41.922
I tell you what...

17:41.956 --> 17:44.057
I've never seen
anything more right.

17:44.092 --> 17:47.594
I'd be proud
to call you my son.

17:48.563 --> 17:49.563
I only wish

17:49.597 --> 17:51.431
that Tempe's mother
was here

17:51.466 --> 17:53.867
to watch her walk
down the aisle.

17:53.901 --> 17:56.470
Me, too.

17:56.504 --> 17:58.705
Thanks.

17:58.740 --> 18:00.140
All right?
Thanks.

18:00.174 --> 18:01.608
Thanks.
Hey, I tell you what.

18:01.642 --> 18:03.310
Why don't we go light
her a candle, huh?

18:03.344 --> 18:04.978
Come on. Well, she really wasn't
the religious type.

18:05.013 --> 18:06.780
It's... you know what?
I'll light it.

18:06.814 --> 18:08.448
It can't hurt, right?
Come on.

18:08.483 --> 18:10.384
It'll be like she's
part of the ceremony.

18:10.418 --> 18:12.719
She'll be, uh,
watching over us, huh?

18:12.754 --> 18:13.987
What the hell.

18:14.022 --> 18:15.255
Can I say that?

18:15.289 --> 18:17.391
Yeah, what the hell?

18:34.442 --> 18:36.943
I'd like to make a toast
before we go.

18:36.978 --> 18:38.258
No, no, Pops,
we're running late.

18:38.279 --> 18:39.479
You do that at
the rehearsal dinner, okay?

18:39.514 --> 18:41.915
Just a little one,
Shrimp, a private one.

18:41.949 --> 18:43.216
I've been waiting
for this day

18:43.251 --> 18:44.518
ever since
I met Tempe.

18:44.552 --> 18:46.053
Then I'm going
after him.

18:46.087 --> 18:47.421
Then I'm going to sing a song.

18:47.455 --> 18:49.322
A little one.
Actually, two.

18:49.357 --> 18:50.824
- I'm pretty hungry.
- We should hurry.

18:50.858 --> 18:52.159
We don't want
to be late to the dinner.

18:52.193 --> 18:53.527
- Yeah.
- You know what?

18:53.561 --> 18:54.895
We're getting in trouble
for loving them.

18:54.929 --> 18:56.730
Better not
to listen.

18:56.764 --> 18:58.231
You're a lucky man, Shrimp.

18:58.266 --> 18:59.466
You found a woman

18:59.500 --> 19:01.401
who's willing
to stand up to you

19:01.436 --> 19:03.670
and call you on your crap.

19:03.704 --> 19:04.971
My what?

19:05.006 --> 19:06.306
You can
be stubborn.

19:06.340 --> 19:08.975
And if she's willing
to stick around

19:09.010 --> 19:10.710
and try to civilize you,

19:10.745 --> 19:13.080
then you'd better listen
and make adjustments,

19:13.114 --> 19:14.614
'cause that's love.

19:14.649 --> 19:16.650
I just want say
a couple of things.

19:18.186 --> 19:19.619
When I was on the run,

19:19.654 --> 19:20.921
trying to stay alive--
which wasn't easy...

19:20.955 --> 19:22.189
Dad.

19:22.223 --> 19:23.557
No.

19:23.591 --> 19:25.058
This actually
sounds good.

19:25.093 --> 19:26.059
You know what?
Maybe I should go

19:26.094 --> 19:27.360
while you clean
up your story.

19:27.395 --> 19:32.399
Seeley, what you have here...

19:32.433 --> 19:34.901
is the final piece
to the puzzle.

19:34.936 --> 19:37.504
It's what's going
to make you whole.

19:39.207 --> 19:41.842
Tempe is the woman that
I always wished I could be,

19:41.876 --> 19:43.944
and the one
that every mother

19:43.978 --> 19:45.579
always prays that
her son will find.

19:45.613 --> 19:46.880
Now I'm gonna cry.

19:46.914 --> 19:48.115
How caI  a speech

19:48.149 --> 19:49.483
if I'm gonna cry?

19:49.517 --> 19:51.585
Oh, don't cry.
I still have to sing.

19:51.619 --> 19:53.753
Oh, hold on, that's the guy,

19:53.788 --> 19:55.755
the limo driver.
We're probably late.

19:55.790 --> 19:58.258
Let's get everything
together here, huh?

19:58.292 --> 19:59.459
Yeah?

19:59.494 --> 20:01.194
Turn on the TV.
The church.

20:01.229 --> 20:03.463
What about the church?

20:03.498 --> 20:05.665
A passing motorist
called 911

20:05.700 --> 20:06.867
at roughly 7:00 p.m.

20:06.901 --> 20:08.702
when they spotted smoke
coming from

20:08.736 --> 20:10.437
the Sacred Heart
Catholic Church.

20:10.471 --> 20:12.405
By 7:30, it was
a three-alarm blaze

20:12.440 --> 20:14.808
with several area fire
departments responding.

20:14.842 --> 20:16.710
Investigators have yet
to determine

20:16.744 --> 20:17.944
the cause of the fire,

20:17.979 --> 20:19.219
though it seems to have started

20:19.247 --> 20:20.547
from the back of the sanctuary.

20:20.581 --> 20:22.582
My God, Booth.

20:22.617 --> 20:24.151
You burned the the church down?

20:30.089 --> 20:31.256
Mmm. Wow.

20:31.290 --> 20:32.891
These are some
zesty eggs, Pops.

20:32.925 --> 20:34.959
Gramma, those are Pops'
famous Eggs From Hell.

20:34.994 --> 20:38.063
At my age, who
wants bland food?

20:38.097 --> 20:39.964
Spicy lets you know
you're alive.

20:39.999 --> 20:41.533
Hey, you can take off
the tux, there, buddy.

20:41.567 --> 20:42.700
The wedding
has been postponed.

20:42.735 --> 20:43.968
He likes it.

20:44.003 --> 20:45.737
Makes him feel
like James Bond.

20:45.771 --> 20:47.238
Where's
Temperance?

20:47.273 --> 20:48.706
She's back on the case,
now that the, uh,

20:48.741 --> 20:50.842
wedding has been delayed.
You should elope.

20:50.876 --> 20:52.844
- Oh...
- What's that?

20:52.878 --> 20:55.380
Means going to a Justice of
the Peace to get hitched.

20:55.414 --> 20:56.815
No fuss, no bother.

20:56.849 --> 20:58.116
Pops,
forget it, okay?

20:58.150 --> 20:59.918
I owe Bones a fuss.

20:59.952 --> 21:01.519
Eloping is romantic.

21:01.554 --> 21:02.720
Chicks dig
romantic, Dad.

21:02.755 --> 21:04.322
That's true.

21:04.356 --> 21:05.890
What do you mean,
"chicks"?

21:05.925 --> 21:07.125
There
you go.

21:07.159 --> 21:08.860
Hot! Hot!
Oh, whoa! Oh!

21:08.894 --> 21:10.562
- Oh!
- I told you it was too spicy.

21:10.596 --> 21:11.696
It'll leave a stain.

21:11.730 --> 21:13.331
Oh!
Okay,

21:13.365 --> 21:15.133
that's a sign
from the gods, huh?

21:15.167 --> 21:16.568
Best man ruins his tuxedo?

21:16.602 --> 21:18.236
Looks like we'll have to
postpone the wedding

21:18.270 --> 21:19.838
till we can do it right.

21:21.974 --> 21:23.274
Dad.

21:23.309 --> 21:24.676
Come in.

21:26.011 --> 21:27.445
You all right
about the wedding?

21:27.480 --> 21:29.180
Yes.

21:29.215 --> 21:30.615
The damage to the victim's feet

21:30.649 --> 21:32.150
is confusing.

21:32.184 --> 21:34.285
See, I-I-I think
it's my fault.

21:34.320 --> 21:35.487
Oh, not
the victim's feet.

21:35.521 --> 21:37.689
But the wedding.
Booth says that

21:37.723 --> 21:39.624
Mom burned down
the church.

21:39.658 --> 21:41.220
Your mom did not
burn down the church.

21:41.245 --> 21:41.993
Booth says that

21:41.994 --> 21:43.895
Mom burned down the church
because she didn't want you

21:43.929 --> 21:45.763
paying for the wedding
with dirty money.

21:45.798 --> 21:47.432
Your mom knows where
the money came from

21:47.466 --> 21:49.467
and she was
all right with it.

21:49.502 --> 21:50.802
Mom's dead.

21:50.836 --> 21:52.370
You want
the truth?

21:52.404 --> 21:55.673
That money comes from
a magical night in Vegas

21:55.708 --> 21:58.476
where I just
couldn't lose.

21:59.278 --> 22:00.678
It was 30 years ago.

22:00.713 --> 22:02.714
I was playing blackjack
and I won all this money.

22:02.748 --> 22:05.783
I... I thought, well, okay,
I might as well bet it all.

22:05.818 --> 22:07.118
Statistically unwise.

22:07.153 --> 22:09.220
And then I realized
what it was for.

22:09.255 --> 22:12.457
Your wedding.

22:15.261 --> 22:17.428
So I grabbed it and was out
of there, and I buried it,

22:17.463 --> 22:20.231
and, 'cause you know,
banks and bank robbers.

22:21.800 --> 22:23.168
Booth's gonna be my son-in-law.

22:23.202 --> 22:26.804
I think he should have just...
trusted me.

22:26.839 --> 22:29.040
You can understand
his reticence, Dad.

22:29.074 --> 22:30.241
Yeah.

22:30.276 --> 22:32.710
You want my advice?

22:34.980 --> 22:36.447
Get married...

22:36.482 --> 22:37.682
today.

22:37.716 --> 22:39.284
I've called
eight churches,

22:39.318 --> 22:42.287
Dad, none of them
are available today.

22:42.321 --> 22:44.522
It doesn't have
to be in a church.

22:44.557 --> 22:46.024
It could be at City Hall.

22:46.058 --> 22:47.659
It could be underwater
or bungee jumping.

22:47.693 --> 22:52.463
Church is very important
to Booth.

22:52.498 --> 22:54.132
And I love him.

22:54.166 --> 22:57.001
I want him to have
what he wants.

23:00.573 --> 23:03.174
Sure.

23:03.209 --> 23:04.576
I have a question.

23:04.610 --> 23:06.578
Is it about the iliopectineal line?
No, it's why

23:06.612 --> 23:07.812
I wasn't invited
to the wedding.

23:07.846 --> 23:10.014
None of us were.
I was invited.

23:10.049 --> 23:12.417
Not really. You're just
going a plus-one, dude.

23:12.451 --> 23:13.451
We work here. We're not friends

23:13.485 --> 23:14.886
with each other,
we're colleagues.

23:14.920 --> 23:17.822
It's a small, intimate,
friends-and-family wedding.

23:17.856 --> 23:19.057
Not for us.

23:19.091 --> 23:20.725
Aw, your feelings are hurt.

23:20.759 --> 23:23.261
Aren't you supposed to be
working on the letter?

23:23.295 --> 23:24.696
I am. I just crave

23:24.730 --> 23:26.497
the camaraderie
of my peers.

23:26.532 --> 23:29.968
I'm just kidding. Angela's
office smells like sage.

23:30.002 --> 23:32.437
Findings, please.

23:32.471 --> 23:34.239
Mr. Fisher?

23:34.273 --> 23:36.341
Well, the majority
of micro-fractures

23:36.375 --> 23:38.409
were confined to the
heels of both feet.

23:38.444 --> 23:40.084
With a secondary number
of micro-fractures

23:40.112 --> 23:41.512
on the ischial
tuberosities.

23:41.547 --> 23:43.681
The amount of damage
to both the right

23:43.716 --> 23:45.416
and left calcanei
is almost identical.

23:45.451 --> 23:46.851
The victim was dragged down
the stairs.

23:46.885 --> 23:49.754
The cracks
on the ischial tuberosities

23:49.788 --> 23:51.689
further support that scenario.

23:51.724 --> 23:53.091
Those occurred when the body
was dragged

23:53.125 --> 23:54.425
onto the landings
in between flights.

23:54.460 --> 23:56.427
How many big a building
are we talking about?

23:56.462 --> 23:58.796
Taking into account
the victim's weight and the height

23:58.831 --> 24:00.031
of a standard
stair riser

24:00.065 --> 24:02.734
and the amount of
spiderweb fractures...

24:02.768 --> 24:04.402
72 stairs and eight landings.

24:04.436 --> 24:07.472
Come on, guys.
It's not that hard.

24:07.506 --> 24:08.573
Fifth floor.

24:08.607 --> 24:09.807
I used to work
construction.

24:09.842 --> 24:11.643
Only one of those buildings

24:11.677 --> 24:14.479
at Adams University sharing that
courtyard had a fifth floor.

24:14.513 --> 24:15.780
Cutting our suspect pool down

24:15.814 --> 24:18.049
to the perhaps 20 academics
that worked on that floor.

24:18.083 --> 24:19.083
Bam.

24:19.118 --> 24:20.652
We still need
a murder weapon.

24:25.591 --> 24:28.092
<i>I feel a little bit guilty,</i>
<i>but I think</i>

24:28.127 --> 24:29.494
I may have won the pool.

24:29.528 --> 24:31.562
You're giving that money
to charity.

24:31.597 --> 24:33.564
Yeah, can't really argue with that.
Exactly.

24:33.599 --> 24:35.900
"Complete Weddings"?

24:35.934 --> 24:37.769
What are you up to?

24:37.803 --> 24:39.704
I can't let their wedding
be postponed again.

24:39.738 --> 24:42.240
You know what's amazing?
I was just about to say,

24:42.274 --> 24:44.075
"Angie, I think you should
throw a wedding

24:44.109 --> 24:45.376
for Booth and Brennan."

24:45.411 --> 24:46.544
You were?

24:46.578 --> 24:48.046
Sure, yeah.

24:48.080 --> 24:50.848
There's just so much to be done

24:50.883 --> 24:53.685
if this is gonna happen today.
Today?!

24:53.719 --> 24:56.120
Yeah. You think that's crazy?

24:56.155 --> 24:58.956
I should, but no.

24:58.991 --> 25:01.859
Because I have
absolute faith

25:01.894 --> 25:04.329
in your absolute faith
that they should be married today.

25:04.363 --> 25:05.663
You do?

25:05.698 --> 25:08.333
Well, listen, we cannot
breathe a word of this

25:08.367 --> 25:10.902
to anyone until we know
that we can pull it off.

25:10.936 --> 25:12.537
Sure, all right.

25:12.571 --> 25:14.872
What if Booth and Brennan won't
agree to go through with this?

25:14.907 --> 25:16.908
Hey, if you build it,
they will come.

25:16.942 --> 25:18.176
I hated that movie.

25:18.210 --> 25:19.677
Yeah? Well,
it doesn't matter.

25:19.712 --> 25:22.413
It was built,
and they came.

25:28.871 --> 25:31.006
Okay, so we know that
the victim was killed

25:31.040 --> 25:32.800
and then dragged down
five flights of stairs.

25:32.809 --> 25:34.609
And we know the murder
weapon left traces

25:34.644 --> 25:36.345
of a wood found
only in Central America.

25:36.379 --> 25:38.951
Cocobolo is a wood used
in making guitars.

25:39.041 --> 25:40.709
I don't think she was
stabbed with a guitar.

25:40.743 --> 25:41.743
And woodwind instruments.

25:41.744 --> 25:43.425
Death by clarinet?
That'd be awesome.

25:43.426 --> 25:45.494
Look, if we don't solve this,
Dr. Brennan is gonna blame us

25:45.528 --> 25:48.166
for everything, probably accuse
me of burning down the church.

25:48.167 --> 25:49.701
Well, that one's easy
to blame on Agent Booth.

25:49.735 --> 25:51.603
I think we should all show
a little compassion.

25:51.637 --> 25:52.904
They're about
to start a new life,

25:52.939 --> 25:54.439
and now all their dreams
have been shattered.

25:54.473 --> 25:55.807
You're just being nice 'cause

25:55.841 --> 25:58.276
you were invited to the wedding.
A pool cue.

25:58.311 --> 25:59.411
There was trace in the wound
from carbon steel,

25:59.445 --> 26:01.046
but no pool cue has a steel tip.

26:01.080 --> 26:03.481
Yeah, but the size is right.

26:03.516 --> 26:06.351
So what else the size of a cue
has a steel tip?

26:08.654 --> 26:11.256
Hey, I have a few things
to arrange for Brennan,

26:11.290 --> 26:13.491
so, you sure that
you can handle this?

26:13.526 --> 26:16.494
I'm running the pattern-
recognition software right now.

26:16.529 --> 26:18.296
Okay, you don't have
to be snottier than usual.

26:18.331 --> 26:20.398
I'll be a phone call
away if you need me.

26:20.433 --> 26:22.300
And don't break
my machine.

26:23.436 --> 26:25.337
The letter
the victim was carrying

26:25.371 --> 26:26.838
was written by Emily Dickinson.

26:26.872 --> 26:28.573
What?

26:28.608 --> 26:29.708
The poet.

26:29.742 --> 26:32.344
Yeah, I know who
Emily Dickinson is.

26:32.378 --> 26:34.746
That-that would make the letter
extremely valuable.

26:34.780 --> 26:36.881
Certainly give someone
a financial motive

26:36.916 --> 26:38.416
for theft and murder.

26:38.451 --> 26:41.486
Are you sure that
it's Emily Dickinson?

26:41.520 --> 26:42.988
The punctuation mirrors that
which was taught

26:43.022 --> 26:44.422
at Mount Holyoke
where Dickinson studied.

26:44.457 --> 26:47.158
The rhyming is experimental
and inexact,

26:47.193 --> 26:49.394
and the single speaker
is consistent

26:49.428 --> 26:53.398
with the style of the 19th
century, so, yes, I'm positive.

26:53.432 --> 26:56.067
Oh... my... God.

26:56.102 --> 26:57.535
Let me see that.

26:57.570 --> 27:00.305
No. You said Dr. Brennan
was your first priority.

27:00.339 --> 27:02.307
And you would never forgive
yourself

27:02.341 --> 27:04.309
if you neglected her well-being
because of this case.

27:04.343 --> 27:08.546
Yeah, you're right.
Thank you, Oliver.

27:08.581 --> 27:10.582
And you're completely
unnecessary.

27:14.286 --> 27:16.688
Well, the squints
found us a suspect.

27:16.722 --> 27:19.391
Janet McCann.
She's an Emily Dickinson scholar.

27:19.425 --> 27:20.759
The victim had
correspondence with her.

27:20.793 --> 27:22.460
How did they land on her?

27:22.495 --> 27:24.863
Victim was killed and dragged
down five flights of stairs.

27:24.897 --> 27:27.232
McCann's office was on the fifth
floor of the Humanities Building

27:27.266 --> 27:28.400
at Adams University.

27:28.434 --> 27:30.435
She, uh, steal and sell
the letter?

27:30.469 --> 27:32.671
I don't think money was
a motive on this one.

27:32.705 --> 27:34.145
According to McCann's
scholarly work,

27:34.173 --> 27:35.734
Emily Dickinson's writing
was an attempt

27:35.741 --> 27:38.410
to feel something that
she had never felt before.

27:38.444 --> 27:39.878
You're saying that Dickinson
was a virgin?

27:39.912 --> 27:41.379
That's the conclusion
of most biographers,

27:41.414 --> 27:43.081
but the letter proves
that wasn't true.

27:43.115 --> 27:44.949
Now, if the victim
had published it,

27:44.984 --> 27:46.885
McCann's entire academic career
would've been pointless.

27:46.919 --> 27:48.186
Look, we have
worse motives, okay?

27:48.220 --> 27:50.155
We just still have to find
a murder weapon.

27:50.189 --> 27:51.589
I'll, uh, I'll
call the squints.

27:51.624 --> 27:54.025
I'm already on it.
I figured you could use a break.

27:54.060 --> 27:55.460
I'm fine.

27:55.494 --> 27:56.594
Okay.

27:56.629 --> 27:57.896
You know,
Bones'll never admit it,

27:57.930 --> 28:01.833
but, you know, she was
dreaming about that wedding.

28:01.867 --> 28:03.668
I wouldn't worry too much
about Dr. Brennan.

28:03.703 --> 28:06.137
She's a lot stronger
than you think.

28:08.374 --> 28:10.442
Right.

28:15.948 --> 28:20.385
Okay, okay, that's
enough of that.

28:20.419 --> 28:22.887
Booth was looking forward
to this wedding so much.

28:22.922 --> 28:25.523
And it's still gonna
happen, sweetie.

28:25.558 --> 28:28.526
So dry your eyes
because today's the day.

28:28.561 --> 28:31.763
Angie, I swiped the keys
for all the exhibits

28:31.797 --> 28:34.299
on the second and third floors.
We're all set. Hi, Dr. B.

28:34.333 --> 28:35.934
All right, I gotta hustle.

28:35.968 --> 28:37.202
What are you doing?

28:37.236 --> 28:38.903
That does not
concern you.

28:38.938 --> 28:40.939
All that matters
is that you two are gonna

28:40.973 --> 28:44.476
tie the knot today.
I've got it all under control.

28:44.510 --> 28:47.479
But Booth wants us
to be in control.

28:47.513 --> 28:49.681
Yeah, well, the killer wanted
to be in control, too.

28:49.715 --> 28:52.117
I don't understand.

28:52.151 --> 28:53.852
That professor

28:53.886 --> 28:58.957
wanted her Emily Dickinson story
to be the only real one, right?

28:58.991 --> 29:02.327
But circumstances changed.

29:02.361 --> 29:03.895
Just like here.

29:03.929 --> 29:06.498
The details aren't
what's important.

29:06.532 --> 29:10.001
The poetry,
that's what's important.

29:10.035 --> 29:12.003
And the poem here
is you and Booth.

29:12.037 --> 29:15.907
So don't put off what you two
have wanted for so long

29:15.941 --> 29:17.642
because a few details have
changed.

29:17.676 --> 29:21.713
But Booth can be stubborn,
Angela.

29:21.747 --> 29:25.583
Not about this.
Because he loves you.

29:25.618 --> 29:29.821
And if you're okay with it,
then he will be, too.

29:31.524 --> 29:35.126
But I don't know
if I'm okay with it.

29:35.161 --> 29:39.564
I'm your best friend, sweetie.
Trust me.

29:39.598 --> 29:41.733
You're okay with it.

29:44.303 --> 29:46.104
<i>So this is from the last book</i>

29:46.138 --> 29:47.972
that Janet McCann wrote
on Emily Dickinson.

29:48.007 --> 29:49.674
It's her bio on
the book jacket.

29:49.708 --> 29:51.709
"In addition to her post
at Adams University,

29:51.744 --> 29:54.012
"Professor Janet McCann
is also an avid hiker,

29:54.046 --> 29:56.948
"and hopes to soon complete what
has been a years-long quest:

29:56.982 --> 29:59.250
exploring the entire length
of the Appalachian Trail."

29:59.285 --> 30:01.085
The trace particulates
Dr. Hodgins found:

30:01.120 --> 30:02.554
shagbark hickory,

30:02.588 --> 30:04.422
found throughout these
states along the trail.

30:04.456 --> 30:06.524
Insect and foliage particulates
from Vermont to West Virginia.

30:06.559 --> 30:08.359
Yeah, it fits.

30:08.394 --> 30:10.595
The killer was a hiker.
It was a trekking pole.

30:10.629 --> 30:12.597
We identified the one
in this picture

30:12.631 --> 30:14.966
had a steel tip
and a Cocobolo shaft,

30:15.000 --> 30:17.468
manufactured in
the late '70s.

30:17.503 --> 30:19.671
It's a match for the injuries.
Unfortunately,

30:19.705 --> 30:21.239
I don't think
there's gonna be a trial.

30:21.273 --> 30:24.275
Booth found out the professor
suffered a stroke two years ago.

30:24.310 --> 30:26.044
She's in a nursing home confined
to a bed.

30:26.078 --> 30:28.780
So now Dr. Brennan is free
and clear to get married.

30:28.814 --> 30:31.316
Oh, I wish it
were that easy.

30:37.723 --> 30:40.225
Angela says we're getting
married today.

30:40.259 --> 30:42.193
So Angela, she's calling
the shots now?

30:42.228 --> 30:43.628
Uh, yes.
She's planning

30:43.662 --> 30:47.098
this whole emergency wedding.

30:47.132 --> 30:50.835
Bones, she would have us getting
married in a garage.

30:50.870 --> 30:52.804
Look, I know what
this wedding

30:52.838 --> 30:55.406
meant to you,
and the flowers and the dress.

30:55.441 --> 30:57.175
I don't care
about any of that.

30:57.209 --> 30:59.110
It's you who I'm worried about.

30:59.144 --> 31:02.380
Me?

31:02.414 --> 31:04.549
Why me?

31:04.583 --> 31:05.950
The church.

31:05.985 --> 31:07.886
I know how important
that is to you.

31:07.920 --> 31:08.887
I didn't ask for that.

31:08.921 --> 31:10.221
That was your idea
this time around.

31:10.256 --> 31:11.489
Because of you.

31:11.523 --> 31:13.024
Bones, I would wear

31:13.058 --> 31:15.593
elephant tusks on my head
and have a squirrel monkey

31:15.628 --> 31:18.329
do the wedding ceremony
if that's what you wanted.

31:20.165 --> 31:22.300
You really don't care?

31:22.334 --> 31:24.469
No.

31:24.503 --> 31:26.604
Well, neither do I...

31:26.639 --> 31:28.940
as long as you're there.

31:30.376 --> 31:32.343
We've waited long enough.

31:32.378 --> 31:34.779
We have.

31:36.081 --> 31:39.417
So, we're doing it?

31:39.451 --> 31:41.119
We're doing it.

31:52.291 --> 31:53.859
I'm not certain
if you are aware,

31:53.893 --> 31:55.861
but Agent Booth and I
are getting married today.

31:56.914 --> 31:58.948
Congrats, Dr. B.
Suck up.

31:58.983 --> 32:00.450
Being polite is not the same
thing as sucking up.

32:00.484 --> 32:02.819
I'm pretty sure that it is.
We're all very happy for you.

32:02.853 --> 32:04.020
Yeah, says the guy
who got invited.

32:04.054 --> 32:05.522
Well, he didn't really
get invited.

32:05.556 --> 32:06.856
He still gets to go.

32:06.891 --> 32:09.626
That's why I asked to speak
to all of you together.

32:09.660 --> 32:12.128
The work that you did
solving this crime,

32:12.162 --> 32:14.531
not only was it expertly
done, it was like,

32:14.565 --> 32:16.366
a wedding present
to me, and I'd like

32:16.400 --> 32:18.268
to invite all of you
to the wedding.

32:18.302 --> 32:20.436
What, as like
some kind of reward?

32:20.471 --> 32:22.405
No.

32:22.439 --> 32:23.840
Then why?

32:23.874 --> 32:25.508
Because Angela said
that I should.

32:25.543 --> 32:27.577
No, no, that is not why.

32:27.611 --> 32:30.713
That's not actually why.

32:30.748 --> 32:32.649
Why are you asking us now
but not before?

32:32.683 --> 32:34.017
I didn't invite you
to my wedding

32:34.051 --> 32:35.385
because I thought
it would be cruel.

32:35.419 --> 32:36.452
Excuse me?

32:36.487 --> 32:38.254
None of you has found
a life companion.

32:38.289 --> 32:43.393
It seemed unfair to ask
lonely people like yourselves

32:43.427 --> 32:47.230
to watch the joyous celebration
Booth and I had planned.

32:47.264 --> 32:49.032
But Angela says that you
are my friends

32:49.066 --> 32:51.067
as well as my colleagues,

32:51.101 --> 32:54.737
and as such, you will take joy
in our good fortune.

32:54.772 --> 32:56.339
So, I'm inviting you.

32:56.373 --> 32:58.908
I have to go put on
my dress now.

32:58.943 --> 33:00.944
I have a girlfriend.
She's awesome.

33:00.978 --> 33:02.111
Are you gonna marry her?

33:02.146 --> 33:04.280
Welcome to
the losers' club.

33:04.315 --> 33:06.382
Do we get to bring guests?

33:06.417 --> 33:08.751
No, no, and the wedding starts
in a half an hour.

33:08.786 --> 33:11.054
I don't really have
a dress for this.

33:11.088 --> 33:12.288
I don't even own a jacket.

33:12.323 --> 33:13.456
No worries.

33:13.490 --> 33:16.759
I have got you covered,
my peeps.

33:16.794 --> 33:19.128
History of fashion
exhibit, third floor.

33:19.163 --> 33:20.496
I'll bite.

33:47.124 --> 33:49.459
Look at all this.

33:51.362 --> 33:54.397
It's like
every woman's dream.

33:54.431 --> 33:56.899
Good to know.

33:59.970 --> 34:02.138
Oh, my God.

34:05.743 --> 34:08.610
This couldn't have
turned out better, honey.

34:08.646 --> 34:09.911
I-I am so proud of you.

34:09.947 --> 34:11.481
Thanks, Mom.

34:11.514 --> 34:12.649
Thank you.

34:12.683 --> 34:14.016
All right.
Okay.

34:14.051 --> 34:15.118
All right.

34:15.152 --> 34:17.654
You ready, Booth?

34:17.688 --> 34:19.722
I've been ready for years.

34:21.025 --> 34:23.326

36:51.775 --> 36:53.476
And, Booth,

36:53.510 --> 36:55.411
it's my fatherly duty

36:55.445 --> 36:57.547
to tell you that
if you do anything

36:57.581 --> 36:59.348
to hurt my girl,

36:59.383 --> 37:01.417
I'll kill you.

37:01.451 --> 37:03.319
Thanks, Max,

37:03.353 --> 37:04.720
for all of this.

37:04.755 --> 37:07.156
Dad.

37:08.926 --> 37:11.060
And by the way, I won the pool.

37:11.094 --> 37:12.562
I knew it was today

37:12.596 --> 37:15.498
that you would tie the knot.

37:18.969 --> 37:20.636
This is not one man

37:20.671 --> 37:24.440
ceremonially handing over
a woman to another man

37:24.474 --> 37:25.708
as though she's property.

37:28.278 --> 37:30.046
Okay?
Come on, Bones.

37:35.919 --> 37:37.820
Ladies and gentlemen,

37:37.855 --> 37:39.488
friends and loved ones

37:39.523 --> 37:40.990
of Seeley Booth

37:41.024 --> 37:43.326
and Temperance Brennan,

37:43.360 --> 37:44.894
if anyone here has any reasons

37:44.928 --> 37:46.696
why these two
shouldn't be married,

37:46.730 --> 37:48.931
keep it to yourself

37:48.966 --> 37:50.366
or get out because this

37:50.400 --> 37:52.668
- is going to happen.
- It is!

37:52.703 --> 37:54.136
I'm a psychic,

37:54.171 --> 37:55.338
and I promise you,

37:55.372 --> 37:56.706
this is gonna happen.

37:56.740 --> 37:57.974
Now, I foresaw this

37:58.008 --> 37:59.775
a long time ago when I first...

37:59.810 --> 38:00.910
Avalon. Avalon.

38:00.944 --> 38:01.944
Right.

38:01.979 --> 38:03.446
Sorry, everyone.

38:03.480 --> 38:05.248
Lucky for me,

38:05.282 --> 38:07.750
Seeley and Temperance
have written their own vows.

38:07.784 --> 38:11.153
So we'll start
with Seeley Booth.

38:11.188 --> 38:13.222
All right.

38:13.257 --> 38:14.790
Okay, um...

38:20.697 --> 38:22.999
You know, I worked really,
really hard

38:23.033 --> 38:25.167
on my vows,

38:25.202 --> 38:27.270
but you know,

38:27.304 --> 38:28.771
now that we're here...

38:28.805 --> 38:31.641
Look, um, hey.

38:31.675 --> 38:33.676
Do you remember

38:33.710 --> 38:37.613
the last time that we were here?

38:37.648 --> 38:39.181
Standing right around
in this spot?

38:39.216 --> 38:40.850
It was, um,

38:40.884 --> 38:41.951
right in the beginning,

38:41.985 --> 38:45.454
before we really knew
each other.

38:45.489 --> 38:46.889
I was trying to get
away from you,

38:46.924 --> 38:50.192
because, um,
you were irritating me.

38:51.895 --> 38:54.764
And, uh, you chased me down,

38:54.798 --> 38:57.433
and you caught up to me.
I said to you, "Listen,

38:57.467 --> 38:59.201
I just have to get all my ducks
in a row, right?"

38:59.236 --> 39:00.436
And then you said to me...

39:00.470 --> 39:01.938
"I can be a duck."

39:05.042 --> 39:06.676
Yeah.

39:06.710 --> 39:10.346
You know, we have been
chasing each other

39:10.380 --> 39:12.048
for a long time.

39:12.082 --> 39:14.483
We've been chasing each other
through wars

39:14.518 --> 39:16.852
and serial killers

39:16.887 --> 39:18.988
and ghosts and snakes

39:19.022 --> 39:21.324
and...

39:22.392 --> 39:24.994
You know, chasing you

39:25.028 --> 39:27.596
has been the smartest thing

39:27.631 --> 39:31.067
that I have ever done
in my life.

39:31.101 --> 39:34.403
And being chased by you

39:34.438 --> 39:38.007
has been my greatest joy,

39:38.041 --> 39:41.177
but now we, uh,

39:41.211 --> 39:44.013
we don't have to chase
each other anymore

39:44.047 --> 39:47.884
because...

39:47.918 --> 39:50.019
we caught each other.

39:53.390 --> 39:54.824
We didn't bring

39:54.858 --> 39:57.193
- enough Kleenex.
- And now, Temperance,

39:57.227 --> 39:58.995
will you be speaking
from the heart as well?

39:59.029 --> 40:01.597
No, I will be speaking
from my mouth.

40:04.001 --> 40:06.435
When Hodgins and I
were buried alive,

40:06.470 --> 40:09.605
we each wrote a message

40:09.640 --> 40:12.141
to someone we loved,

40:12.175 --> 40:14.810
in case our bodies
were ever found.

40:14.845 --> 40:16.546
Hodgins wrote to Angela,

40:16.580 --> 40:18.915
and...

40:18.949 --> 40:20.583
I wrote to you, Booth.

40:33.563 --> 40:37.366
"Dear Agent Booth,

40:37.400 --> 40:39.401
"You are a confusing man.

40:39.436 --> 40:42.871
"You are irrational
and impulsive,

40:42.906 --> 40:45.341
"superstitious and exasperating.

40:45.375 --> 40:47.850
"You believe in ghosts
and angels,

40:47.851 --> 40:50.252
"and maybe even Santa Claus,

40:50.286 --> 40:52.321
"and because of you,
I've started to see

40:52.355 --> 40:55.190
"the universe differently.

40:55.225 --> 40:57.860
"How is it possible

40:57.894 --> 41:00.295
"that simply looking
into your fine face

41:00.330 --> 41:02.164
"gives me so much joy?

41:02.198 --> 41:03.932
"Why does it make me so happy

41:03.967 --> 41:05.434
"that every time

41:05.468 --> 41:07.102
"I try to sneak a peek at you,

41:07.136 --> 41:09.371
"you're already looking at me?

41:09.405 --> 41:12.374
"Like you, it makes no sense.

41:12.408 --> 41:16.445
And like you, it feels right."

41:17.747 --> 41:20.148
"If I ever get out of here,

41:20.183 --> 41:22.417
"I will find a time and a place

41:22.452 --> 41:24.219
"to tell you

41:24.254 --> 41:26.989
"that you make my life messy
and confusing

41:27.023 --> 41:28.891
"and unfocused

41:28.925 --> 41:30.359
"and irrational

41:30.393 --> 41:32.961
and wonderful."

41:35.298 --> 41:37.432
This is that time.

41:37.467 --> 41:40.269
This is that place.

41:51.347 --> 41:52.881
Did I do that wrong?

41:52.916 --> 41:54.316
No.

41:55.418 --> 41:57.386
Oh.

42:05.295 --> 42:06.728
By the powers vested in me

42:06.763 --> 42:09.331
by the District of Columbia
and the Internet,

42:09.365 --> 42:12.501
I now pronounce you
man and wife.

42:14.270 --> 42:15.938
You can kiss me now.

42:15.972 --> 42:17.105
Aldo didn't say
that I could kiss you.

42:17.140 --> 42:19.174
As usual, she's right. Go.

42:36.159 --> 42:38.627
So, what do you think
happens now?
