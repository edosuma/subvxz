00:14.972 --> 00:16.391
Mom?
What are you...

00:24.571 --> 00:26.165
Mom.

00:35.216 --> 00:36.416
Y'all know what it is.

00:36.459 --> 00:37.892
I'm on fire.

00:37.919 --> 00:39.438
Somebody put me out, yo.

00:42.157 --> 00:43.467
All right.
There you go.

00:43.493 --> 00:46.258
What are you doing out
of your retired shrink costume?

00:46.276 --> 00:48.081
Having a meeting
with Evelyn Danton

00:48.108 --> 00:49.675
from my book club for coffee.

00:49.701 --> 00:51.802
Meeting?

00:51.830 --> 00:53.952
Man, that woman
can do more in bed

00:53.975 --> 00:57.038
than any post-menopausal woman
has any right to be able to do.

00:57.053 --> 00:58.473
There goes the appetite.

00:59.607 --> 01:01.110
Hey, dad.

01:01.974 --> 01:03.763
- Yup?
- What do you do if you like

01:03.797 --> 01:06.265
a girl and you like a boy?

01:09.410 --> 01:11.364
I don't know, Roscoe.

01:11.399 --> 01:12.666
I don't know.

01:12.700 --> 01:14.034
I'm open to whatever.

01:18.458 --> 01:20.482
You know,
today is the anniversary

01:20.517 --> 01:21.484
of your mother's death.

01:21.518 --> 01:23.253
- Fuck, dad.
- What?

01:23.287 --> 01:25.822
I know
it's the fuckin' anniversary.

01:25.857 --> 01:27.391
I know it every fuckin' year,
and if I forget,

01:27.425 --> 01:28.592
you say it.

01:28.626 --> 01:30.027
You say it every year, dad.

01:30.061 --> 01:31.963
Can we just skip the part
next year

01:31.997 --> 01:33.331
where you tell me
it's the anniversary?

01:33.365 --> 01:34.432
So you're good with it?

01:34.466 --> 01:35.700
Yeah, I'm fine.

01:35.734 --> 01:36.934
You don't have
to be fine, Marty.

01:36.969 --> 01:38.936
What... what I'm not, dad,

01:38.971 --> 01:40.571
is in the mood
for a session right now.

01:40.606 --> 01:42.574
Please. I'm just trying to get
out the fuckin' door, man.

01:42.608 --> 01:43.909
It's not a session, man,

01:43.943 --> 01:46.311
if you tell me
you're having a hard time,

01:46.345 --> 01:49.114
like I am,
and we say to each other,

01:49.148 --> 01:51.483
"look, I'm having
a hard fucking day.

01:51.518 --> 01:53.185
And I hope you get
through it okay."

01:53.220 --> 01:54.387
Okay?
Okay.

01:54.421 --> 01:57.691
'Cause that's what...

01:57.726 --> 01:59.627
That's what families do, Marty.

01:59.661 --> 02:01.095
- Okay, dad.
- Yeah.

02:01.129 --> 02:03.022
It's all right to do that.

02:06.535 --> 02:07.827
Hey, dad.

02:10.773 --> 02:12.474
Want me to teach you
how to Dougie?

02:13.871 --> 02:16.545
Yeah, man,
teach me how to Dougie.

02:28.591 --> 02:30.092
Hey. Did you guys all forget
what time it is?

02:30.127 --> 02:31.861
We got to be down in the car.

02:31.896 --> 02:33.730
Marty,
maybe you should not be here.

02:33.765 --> 02:34.998
I don't know, maybe you
could hide or something.

02:35.033 --> 02:36.199
This is how it ends.

02:36.234 --> 02:38.536
Daddy, it is a very bad day.

02:38.570 --> 02:40.404
- Yeah.
- No.

02:45.912 --> 02:47.713
Motherfucker.

02:47.747 --> 02:49.415
It's the Galweather team.

02:49.449 --> 02:52.418
Who rocked our socks off
in <i>Nueve Jork.</i>

02:52.452 --> 02:54.019
Unbelievable.

02:54.054 --> 02:56.889
Amazing.
This is gonna be great.

02:58.325 --> 03:00.893
Hey, guys.

03:00.927 --> 03:04.964
I think... I think you've
interfaced with Greg Norbert

03:04.998 --> 03:07.099
- From...
- Did he just say interfaced?

03:07.133 --> 03:08.967
Yeah.
Well, maybe we should just put

03:09.002 --> 03:11.504
this out there
because I'm sure the rumors

03:11.538 --> 03:12.605
are already flying.

03:12.639 --> 03:13.939
I got this one, skip.

03:13.974 --> 03:17.310
We just loved
what your team did for us

03:17.344 --> 03:19.445
in new York.
I mean, loved it.

03:19.480 --> 03:20.580
Really?

03:20.614 --> 03:21.881
So much.

03:21.916 --> 03:23.783
And after you left,

03:23.818 --> 03:27.354
we felt sad.

03:27.389 --> 03:28.422
No, not really.

03:28.456 --> 03:29.423
No, but we had
all this bailout money,

03:29.457 --> 03:30.825
and we realized, no,

03:30.859 --> 03:32.693
we're paying out the ass
for top-tier consulting firms

03:32.727 --> 03:34.028
like yours,

03:34.062 --> 03:35.729
so why not acquire one

03:36.549 --> 03:39.033
for internal strategic
planning?

03:39.067 --> 03:40.200
Boom.
Get it.

03:40.235 --> 03:41.201
Boom me, Marty.

03:41.236 --> 03:42.636
Boom.

03:42.670 --> 03:44.972
And then all these millions
we're pissing away

03:45.006 --> 03:46.106
in consulting fees

03:46.141 --> 03:47.407
all in-house.

03:47.442 --> 03:49.243
We buy it, own it, control it,

03:49.277 --> 03:50.477
use it, bop!

03:50.511 --> 03:51.778
It's ours.

03:52.469 --> 03:55.891
You will be ours.

03:59.188 --> 04:01.890
I mean that...
I mean that

04:01.924 --> 04:03.591
in a figurative sense.

04:03.626 --> 04:05.427
Let me put it this way...

04:08.331 --> 04:10.499
I'm all about family.

04:10.533 --> 04:14.637
I mean, I personally don't have
a family anymore,

04:14.671 --> 04:19.642
so you, you all, will be

04:19.676 --> 04:20.642
my new family.

04:20.677 --> 04:21.844
We're gonna work together

04:21.878 --> 04:25.543
and build
a profitable/happy family.

04:26.301 --> 04:28.518
<i>Familia!</i>

04:32.004 --> 04:34.488
Yeah.

04:35.426 --> 04:37.460
Okay, Greg.

04:37.495 --> 04:38.662
Thanks.

04:38.696 --> 04:41.965
Whether we go forward
with this or not,

04:42.053 --> 04:44.277
I want you to help
in whatever way you can.

04:44.869 --> 04:48.638
Metro is an enormous...

04:48.673 --> 04:51.275
I mean, enormous company.

04:51.309 --> 04:53.394
Which means
it's bigger than us.

04:54.578 --> 04:56.313
Okay.
Carry on.

04:56.347 --> 04:57.914
That's all right.

04:57.949 --> 04:59.482
All right, party time.

04:59.517 --> 05:01.618
Come on.
Beautiful.

05:02.035 --> 05:03.340
Beautiful.

05:03.721 --> 05:05.027
Mm.

05:05.423 --> 05:06.390
Hey, Marty.

05:06.424 --> 05:08.158
Can I talk to you for a minute?

05:08.192 --> 05:10.324
Sure, Greg.
Let's talk.

05:11.761 --> 05:14.441
So, look, buddy, look.

05:15.332 --> 05:17.367
I'm gonna... I'm gonna smash
your head in,

05:17.401 --> 05:21.113
then I'm gonna personally fuck
your bashed-in eye socket.

05:21.972 --> 05:23.072
Metaphorically.

05:23.106 --> 05:24.940
Well, as long
as it's metaphorically.

05:24.975 --> 05:26.175
Yeah.

05:27.386 --> 05:28.691
Okay.

05:29.679 --> 05:30.646
Hey, Greg?

05:30.680 --> 05:32.782
How's your beautiful wife?

05:32.816 --> 05:34.814
I heard she tastes
like pinkberry.

05:41.126 --> 05:42.393
Our pod in particular

05:42.428 --> 05:43.995
represents the loss
of his entire life.

05:44.029 --> 05:46.364
You know, I got to say,
he was kind of friendly to me.

05:46.398 --> 05:47.566
Are you fucking kidding me,
Harvard?

05:47.600 --> 05:49.201
Were you there?
As friendly as the tranny?

05:49.235 --> 05:51.470
What?

05:51.505 --> 05:53.072
Come here.
Don't keep walking.

05:53.106 --> 05:54.707
What, the tranny?
No tranny.

05:54.741 --> 05:56.208
Okay, well,
Doug really does tell it better,

05:56.243 --> 05:57.243
but I'll give it a whirl.
God damn it.

05:57.277 --> 05:58.310
We're drinking at a club

05:58.345 --> 06:00.246
when Doug turns to talk
to a very cute,

06:00.280 --> 06:02.081
very muscular
young little lady.

06:02.115 --> 06:03.449
Big deal.
So it's a chat.

06:03.483 --> 06:05.218
That's when I saw it, right?
Adam's apple.

06:05.252 --> 06:06.920
The size of a fucking handball.

06:06.954 --> 06:08.622
Yeah, I saw it too
and I thought

06:08.656 --> 06:10.257
it was gross.
They left the club together.

06:10.291 --> 06:11.925
What the fuck?

06:11.960 --> 06:13.794
You're a liar.
I am not lying.

06:13.828 --> 06:15.129
I saw you leave with her.

06:15.163 --> 06:16.864
You didn't see shit.
I left on my...

06:16.898 --> 06:18.399
let me tell you
why I left on my own.

06:18.434 --> 06:19.934
Because when she kissed me
on the cheek good-bye,

06:19.969 --> 06:22.237
I could feel
her whiskers, so...

06:22.271 --> 06:23.839
- You kissed her.
- What?

06:23.873 --> 06:25.107
- That is what happened.
- You're doing it again. Wrong.

06:25.141 --> 06:26.275
You're wrong.
You're wrong, wrong.

06:26.309 --> 06:27.443
Listen, where the fuck
are we going?

06:27.477 --> 06:29.378
We're going to Indiana.

06:29.412 --> 06:30.779
Home of the Raggedy Ann Doll.

06:30.813 --> 06:32.213
- Shut...
- The fuck...

06:32.248 --> 06:33.414
Up.

06:33.449 --> 06:36.584
IBC,

06:36.618 --> 06:38.419
integrated bottling
corporation.

06:38.453 --> 06:40.454
I love
their diet chocolate soda.

06:40.488 --> 06:41.688
Aren't those good?

06:41.723 --> 06:43.390
Yeah, interesting issue here.

06:43.424 --> 06:45.158
IBC's been developing

06:45.192 --> 06:47.126
a complete business
restructuring

06:47.160 --> 06:48.628
for the past several years,

06:48.662 --> 06:49.829
something they're calling
Apache,

06:49.863 --> 06:53.166
a ground-up reboot
of their entire flow.

06:53.201 --> 06:54.434
Everything from the computer
that tells them

06:54.469 --> 06:56.637
how much syrup to put
in Doug's chocolate soda

06:56.671 --> 06:58.305
to when to pay the workers
and how much.

06:58.340 --> 06:59.607
They're getting ready
to go live.

06:59.641 --> 07:01.309
Now there's a couple
warring factions we need

07:01.343 --> 07:02.711
to keep our eye out on, okay?

07:02.745 --> 07:05.547
The CEO who believes
that his Apache Enterprise

07:05.581 --> 07:08.216
- Resource Planning Initiative...
- Otherwise known as E.R.P.

07:08.251 --> 07:09.785
I know what the fuck
it stands for.

07:09.819 --> 07:11.686
He believes it is, "A",
the next wave

07:11.721 --> 07:13.521
in business process
reengineering

07:13.556 --> 07:14.956
while the CFO believes
it is, "B",

07:14.991 --> 07:17.926
a ridiculous and masturbatory
money suck.

07:18.321 --> 07:19.895
It's probably not "A".

07:19.929 --> 07:22.097
Easy. We throw every model
we can think of at it,

07:22.131 --> 07:23.531
and we see which one performs.

07:23.565 --> 07:25.299
That would be
a really good idea

07:25.334 --> 07:27.869
if it were up and running.
Dumb shit.

07:27.903 --> 07:31.439
It's very cute the way
you're all sort of learning

07:31.473 --> 07:33.675
at your own pace, but none
of this shit matters, okay?

07:33.709 --> 07:35.076
The only thing
that we need to figure out

07:35.111 --> 07:37.513
is what makes them think
they can't live without us

07:37.547 --> 07:40.016
for the next three years
while we infect the host

07:40.050 --> 07:41.594
and bleed them dry.

07:43.220 --> 07:44.602
Shut up.
I'm not drunk.

07:46.057 --> 07:49.134
Hey, Doug, if you didn't hook
up with that tranny,

07:50.087 --> 07:53.563
then why did you guys leave the
club at the same exact moment?

07:55.249 --> 07:58.391
Why did you...

07:58.963 --> 08:00.497
Excuse me,

08:00.523 --> 08:02.602
can I please get
some more warm nuts?

08:10.496 --> 08:12.920
You always get the tour.

08:13.888 --> 08:15.751
I love the tour.

08:15.785 --> 08:17.919
It's always the best workplace
on earth.

08:17.954 --> 08:20.226
It's... it's goddamn Disneyland.

08:21.223 --> 08:23.090
You know,
if it's all so fucking great,

08:23.125 --> 08:24.586
why are we here?

08:25.884 --> 08:27.351
All the way down that way.

08:27.398 --> 08:29.963
Then there's the moment
when you meet the players.

08:29.998 --> 08:34.001
In this case,
the usual megalomaniacal CEO.

08:34.035 --> 08:37.171
Hi, Jonathan.
Marty Kaan from Galweather.

08:37.205 --> 08:39.740
Thank you so much
for giving us this opportunity.

08:39.775 --> 08:41.241
We are really looking forward
to giving you

08:41.275 --> 08:44.279
some pretty enlightening
takeaways on your Apache E.R.P.

08:44.313 --> 08:45.747
You say something like that.

08:45.782 --> 08:47.650
Then he says...
Hey, Marty.

08:47.684 --> 08:49.752
Let's do this.

08:51.454 --> 08:54.390
And then you've got
your rain man-like

08:54.424 --> 08:55.924
chief financial officer.

08:55.959 --> 08:57.993
In this case, Spalding Winter.

08:58.027 --> 09:00.462
He's the guy who's figured out
this whole E.R.P. thing sucks

09:00.497 --> 09:04.466
and he's trying to make his case
to Jonathan over here.

09:04.501 --> 09:08.704
Even though the money
is kind of here.

09:08.800 --> 09:10.644
And you've got

09:12.075 --> 09:14.871
disgruntled little management
here.

09:17.339 --> 09:18.680
Here we go.

09:18.715 --> 09:21.049
Marty Kaan.

09:21.083 --> 09:23.097
It is a pleasure.
Spalding Winter.

09:28.019 --> 09:29.891
Now the trick.

09:29.926 --> 09:32.727
How do we get these two
what they want... Eventually

09:32.762 --> 09:35.480
after taking a shitload
of their money?

09:36.599 --> 09:39.214
And my wife Ginelle.

09:40.669 --> 09:42.303
Forgot my phone this morning.

09:42.338 --> 09:45.175
Hey. Like I have nothing else
to do today.

09:48.753 --> 09:50.074
So now...

09:51.746 --> 09:53.347
One second. Jesus.

09:57.185 --> 09:58.618
It's all about leverage.

09:58.653 --> 10:01.324
I leverage
the way people perceive me.

10:02.090 --> 10:03.753
Not a whole lot going on here.

10:04.459 --> 10:06.027
Not a whole lot except...

10:17.137 --> 10:18.837
Ginelle likes that black dick.

10:18.872 --> 10:20.427
What are you gonna do?

10:20.940 --> 10:22.674
Nice to meet you.

10:22.708 --> 10:23.675
Marty Kaan.

10:23.709 --> 10:25.176
Hi, Marty.

10:25.211 --> 10:28.513
Hey, oh,
we would love to have you and...

10:28.547 --> 10:30.816
- Jeannie.
- Jeannie join us for dinner.

10:30.850 --> 10:32.484
Maybe tomorrow night?
Sure.

10:32.509 --> 10:33.812
We'd love to.

10:38.280 --> 10:40.427
So Greg Norbert's got our nuts
in a noose.

10:40.461 --> 10:43.130
Anybody feeling like these guys
are gonna be our salvation?

10:43.165 --> 10:45.433
No. And this E.R.P.
better be good

10:45.467 --> 10:47.331
because they are
barely hanging on.

10:48.538 --> 10:50.738
You know what,
something's been playing

10:50.776 --> 10:52.106
on my mind a little bit.

10:52.141 --> 10:54.475
I'm curious, why do you think
that she invited you

10:54.510 --> 10:56.277
and Jeannie to dinner
and not me and Clyde?

10:56.311 --> 10:57.812
Are you serious?

10:57.846 --> 10:59.713
I mean, it was a slap
in the face.

10:59.748 --> 11:00.881
We were standing right there.

11:00.915 --> 11:02.582
How can you miss this?
This is insane to me.

11:02.617 --> 11:03.717
It was like she was saying,
"hey, hey, you underlings

11:03.751 --> 11:05.418
"don't exist or anything,

11:05.453 --> 11:06.786
"so why would you like
a delicious home-cooked meal

11:06.821 --> 11:07.921
in our great mid-Western
mansion?"

11:07.955 --> 11:09.389
It is incredibly rude.

11:09.423 --> 11:10.624
- I mean, I haven't had
a home-cooked meal

11:10.658 --> 11:12.059
in God knows how long.

11:12.093 --> 11:13.594
Maybe she sensed all she'd get
from you guys

11:13.629 --> 11:14.595
were stories about getting head
from trannies

11:14.629 --> 11:15.896
and Starwood points.

11:15.931 --> 11:16.964
I did not get head
from her, okay?

11:18.166 --> 11:19.333
- I got nothing from her.
- Well...

11:19.368 --> 11:21.069
I've told you a thousand times.

11:21.103 --> 11:22.537
You know what, I'm not gonna...

11:22.571 --> 11:24.139
Ha-ho,
I see what you're doing.

11:24.173 --> 11:25.741
I'm not gonna take the bait.
Not gonna do it.

11:25.775 --> 11:27.543
Not gonna sink
to your level, okay?

11:27.577 --> 11:28.744
And her name is Kiki,
by the way.

11:28.778 --> 11:29.979
Jesus Christ.

11:30.013 --> 11:31.447
"Her name is Kiki,
by the way."

11:31.481 --> 11:33.415
- God damn it.
- Listen, dirty mommy Winter

11:33.450 --> 11:34.683
wants to fuck me.

11:34.718 --> 11:36.418
She invited Jeannie along
to be the beard.

11:36.453 --> 11:38.120
I love the humility.

11:38.155 --> 11:40.122
Thank you.
How many times I got to tell

11:40.156 --> 11:41.423
you guys, you got to break
this shit down

11:41.458 --> 11:43.063
from the first nanosecond?

11:43.393 --> 11:45.595
Tell me about the CEO
Strauss-Robb, go.

11:45.629 --> 11:48.531
Conspiratorial... the wink
and the "let's do this."

11:48.566 --> 11:50.133
How about the CFO, Doug?

11:50.167 --> 11:51.668
Well, he liked you.

11:53.204 --> 11:54.704
Doug, the CFO?

11:54.739 --> 11:56.473
Did not like you,
let me finish,

11:56.507 --> 11:58.375
because he is
against the Apache E.R.P.

11:58.409 --> 11:59.943
Which we have been brought in
to bolster.

11:59.978 --> 12:01.779
And talk to me
about dirty mommy Winter.

12:01.813 --> 12:04.816
She wanted to fuck you because
you got that big black cock.

12:04.850 --> 12:07.052
Now we just have to collect
all those details together

12:07.086 --> 12:08.320
and use them to our advantage.

12:08.354 --> 12:10.022
Yeah, but you're
not gonna fuck her, Marty.

12:13.277 --> 12:15.225
You're not gonna fuck her,
Marty.

12:15.548 --> 12:17.516
I...

12:18.975 --> 12:20.277
Hey.

12:22.536 --> 12:23.969
Hide it, hide it, hide it.

12:24.004 --> 12:25.538
Thank you. You're doing
the right thing here.

12:25.572 --> 12:26.605
Fuck you.

12:26.640 --> 12:28.340
I think consultants are scum.

12:28.375 --> 12:30.276
But this thing is codezilla.

12:30.310 --> 12:31.944
I was involved
with all the simulations,

12:31.979 --> 12:33.446
and if Apache goes live,

12:33.480 --> 12:34.680
IBC goes dark.

12:34.715 --> 12:36.149
We're dark for one week,

12:36.183 --> 12:37.917
Coke or Pepsico's
gonna come in here

12:37.952 --> 12:39.486
and buy us up for pennies
on the dollar.

12:39.520 --> 12:41.444
They'll split us up,
and it'll be over.

12:41.956 --> 12:43.810
So you do something with that.

12:56.271 --> 13:00.574
We told the decorator,
"just design your goddamn ID."

13:00.609 --> 13:02.777
You can really see that.

13:02.811 --> 13:05.069
Come sit over next to me.

13:05.154 --> 13:08.179
Everybody looks so huge
from down here.

13:08.217 --> 13:10.385
It's so comfortable here.

13:10.537 --> 13:13.015
Hey, say, Ginny,
have you had a chance

13:13.046 --> 13:15.158
to give Marty the grand tour
of the house?

13:15.192 --> 13:16.626
No.
Yes, Marty.

13:16.661 --> 13:19.029
Come with me on the <i>Grande</i> tour

13:19.063 --> 13:20.564
of the whole house.
Okay.

13:20.599 --> 13:22.967
And you two can get
to know each other better

13:23.002 --> 13:25.370
while we're touring.

13:25.404 --> 13:28.607
I would love a tour.

13:28.641 --> 13:31.643
You start downstairs
with Spalding,

13:31.678 --> 13:33.412
and I will start upstairs
with Marty.

13:33.446 --> 13:34.546
Two tours.

13:39.761 --> 13:41.886
It's okay.
It's her thing.

13:41.920 --> 13:44.155
You actually want me
to follow your wife?

13:44.189 --> 13:45.222
It's what she wants.

13:45.257 --> 13:46.257
What do you want?

13:46.291 --> 13:48.092
I want Apache stopped.

13:48.126 --> 13:50.794
So you think I'm gonna trade
banging your wife

13:50.829 --> 13:52.953
for bagging
the E.R.P. green light?

13:54.133 --> 13:55.900
- No?
- Marty!

13:58.026 --> 13:59.782
Look, just go.
She's an animal.

14:21.009 --> 14:22.595
Are you all right?

14:22.630 --> 14:25.365
I'm sorry.
Size 7 Louboutins, right?

14:25.399 --> 14:26.886
- Yup.
Dead-on.

14:26.921 --> 14:29.019
- You have gorgeous feet.
- Thank you.

14:29.036 --> 14:31.037
I don't suppose
you'd let me rub them.

14:33.449 --> 14:36.433
Wouldn't Ginelle object
to that?

14:36.476 --> 14:38.699
Nothing weird.
Just a foot massage.

14:40.714 --> 14:43.782
I would let a homeless
schizophrenic rub my feet.

14:43.816 --> 14:45.066
I'll get my oils.

14:49.956 --> 14:53.659
- My.
- My goodness.

14:58.231 --> 15:02.301
This is my naughty room.

15:02.336 --> 15:04.904
I can...
I can see that.

15:04.938 --> 15:06.939
You and I have wanted this

15:06.974 --> 15:09.705
since the second we laid eyes
on each other.

15:09.740 --> 15:12.861
So why don't you give me
that big black dick of yours?

15:12.933 --> 15:14.613
Come on.

15:14.647 --> 15:16.215
Do it.

15:17.450 --> 15:18.792
Is this a saddle?

15:21.154 --> 15:22.754
Are you sure this is okay?

15:25.158 --> 15:27.071
Let go, Jeannie.

15:27.766 --> 15:30.336
Let go.

15:32.564 --> 15:34.131
God.

15:34.166 --> 15:35.632
Come on, Marty.

15:35.667 --> 15:37.501
It's fine with Spalding.

15:37.535 --> 15:40.737
This is the accommodation
that has been made.

15:40.812 --> 15:42.610
What do you mean,
"accommodation"?

15:42.642 --> 15:44.342
Because of Spalding's handicap.

15:44.463 --> 15:45.797
Your husband has a handicap?

15:48.329 --> 15:50.579
His... his microphallus.

15:50.613 --> 15:53.048
I'm sorry, it sounded
like you said microphallus.

15:53.082 --> 15:55.584
His microphallus.

15:55.758 --> 15:58.493
His... his... his little man-clit.

15:58.542 --> 16:00.221
His teen-is.

16:00.256 --> 16:02.057
- No, don't say teen-is.
- It's like a teeny, tiny,

16:02.092 --> 16:03.358
little mushroom.

16:03.393 --> 16:05.993
The guy's got a microphallus.

16:06.028 --> 16:08.530
That must be so bad for you.

16:08.564 --> 16:10.131
Thank God I have you.

16:12.101 --> 16:13.468
You nasty.

16:13.502 --> 16:15.937
Shit.

16:15.971 --> 16:17.171
I'm fun.

16:17.206 --> 16:19.674
You're just strong.

16:21.477 --> 16:23.111
This is gonna hurt.

16:24.780 --> 16:27.182
That's attached.
Go easy on me.

16:35.995 --> 16:37.695
What is that?

16:39.924 --> 16:42.698
Yeah, that's not gonna work
for me.

16:45.121 --> 16:46.542
Really?

16:49.722 --> 16:51.027
Actually,

16:53.641 --> 16:54.941
Play on.

16:59.479 --> 17:01.644
Yeah.

17:02.449 --> 17:04.034
I'm sorry, officer.

17:05.252 --> 17:06.886
Just go deep.

17:14.827 --> 17:17.378
So... Indiana.

17:19.964 --> 17:21.491
Yeah, Indiana.

17:22.501 --> 17:24.335
That was some weird shit.

17:24.921 --> 17:26.839
And my toes are all squishy.

17:26.873 --> 17:29.475
What do you say we just keep
this one between us, all right?

17:29.509 --> 17:30.576
Yes, that'd be best.
Yeah.

17:31.845 --> 17:33.218
Hey, Spalding.

17:33.613 --> 17:34.714
Good morning.

17:34.748 --> 17:36.583
Listen, I don't want
to put my foot

17:36.617 --> 17:37.751
in my mouth
or anything like that...

17:37.785 --> 17:39.519
- Good, good.
- Yeah, but there's

17:39.553 --> 17:41.554
a couple of small details
I wanted to go over with you.

17:41.589 --> 17:43.156
I mean, they're tiny really.
Miniscule.

17:43.191 --> 17:46.660
Just about like that.

17:46.695 --> 17:48.015
I mean...

17:49.281 --> 17:50.765
Okay.

17:50.799 --> 17:51.966
She told you.

17:52.898 --> 17:54.218
What if she did?

17:54.503 --> 17:56.971
So, what, I'm supposed
to buy your silence

17:57.005 --> 17:59.540
about my condition

17:59.859 --> 18:01.648
by caving on the E.R.P.

18:01.781 --> 18:05.313
And then you won't let it slip
on a business website

18:05.347 --> 18:06.882
or speak about it?

18:06.916 --> 18:08.218
Right.

18:09.530 --> 18:11.185
Talk to one of my colleagues.

18:11.220 --> 18:12.553
I see.

18:12.587 --> 18:14.488
You know, Marty,
people in my position

18:14.523 --> 18:15.723
wield quite a bit of power,

18:15.757 --> 18:18.859
certainly more than you do
as a consultant.

18:18.893 --> 18:20.660
And I find that anybody

18:20.694 --> 18:22.295
in a position
of power is compensating

18:22.329 --> 18:25.231
for something,
and I'm sure you've got

18:25.265 --> 18:28.534
some deep, primal wound

18:29.122 --> 18:31.301
that haunts you and drives you.

18:32.403 --> 18:34.707
Clearly from the sounds
my wife was making last night,

18:34.742 --> 18:36.576
it is not your cock size.
Well, good for you.

18:36.611 --> 18:38.078
But if you think for a second

18:38.112 --> 18:40.447
that I am going
to sell out my expertise

18:40.481 --> 18:41.786
for my pride,

18:41.864 --> 18:43.250
you are mistaken.

18:43.285 --> 18:45.686
I am not backing that E.R.P.

18:45.721 --> 18:47.028
to the board.

18:47.583 --> 18:48.890
And Marty,

18:49.447 --> 18:50.747
fuck you.

18:56.012 --> 18:58.075
Neither sides are gonna move
on this.

18:58.101 --> 18:59.468
I got nothing.

18:59.502 --> 19:01.103
But we're going in
giving full support

19:01.137 --> 19:02.104
for the E.R.P., right?

19:02.138 --> 19:03.305
With some caveats, delays,

19:03.339 --> 19:04.439
the usual bullshit,
that's what we do.

19:04.474 --> 19:05.474
I don't know, man.

19:05.508 --> 19:06.475
What do you mean
you don't know?

19:06.509 --> 19:07.810
We gotta have something
right there.

19:07.844 --> 19:09.712
Motherfucker. I can feel my
gastritis jacking up.

19:09.746 --> 19:11.125
Jonathan.

19:12.182 --> 19:13.688
You got a second?

19:15.785 --> 19:18.353
Don't forget who brought you in
on this engagement.

19:19.856 --> 19:21.568
I will not.

19:27.864 --> 19:30.109
You smug shithead, Marty.

19:30.800 --> 19:32.134
I brought you in
on this engagement.

19:32.168 --> 19:33.803
Good money.
Top fucking dollar.

19:33.837 --> 19:38.008
All you had to do was shut up
and let me launch my E.R.P.

19:38.042 --> 19:40.444
Buddy, it was going
to ruin your company.

19:40.478 --> 19:41.545
I'm sorry.

19:41.580 --> 19:43.247
I put my heart and soul
into that E.R.P.

19:43.282 --> 19:44.949
Heart and soul, Jonathan?

19:44.984 --> 19:46.084
Really?
Like you have those?

19:46.118 --> 19:47.419
You.

19:47.453 --> 19:48.920
Galweather
is off this engagement

19:48.954 --> 19:51.089
as of right the fuck now.

19:51.123 --> 19:52.757
So you gonna go live
with Apache?

19:52.792 --> 19:54.289
Of course I am, you idiot.

19:54.693 --> 19:56.594
The board has agreed
to back me.

19:57.253 --> 19:59.129
Jonathan, did you ever consider

19:59.164 --> 20:01.364
just this once
that all the advice

20:01.399 --> 20:03.633
and the consultants
and the simulations,

20:03.668 --> 20:05.550
that they might just be right?

20:08.038 --> 20:09.370
No.

20:15.917 --> 20:17.314
Well, that just happened.

20:17.698 --> 20:21.886
Hey, maybe we'll meet up in
some hostile takeover chat room.

20:21.921 --> 20:23.655
All I know is I'm going
to cabo for a week

20:23.689 --> 20:25.257
before I start job hunting.

20:25.291 --> 20:27.691
Hey, Marty,
what the fuck was that?

20:27.737 --> 20:29.685
Marty, look at me.
What the fuck was that?

20:29.737 --> 20:31.972
What just happened?
<i>Mira,</i> babies. <i>Mira.</i>

20:33.733 --> 20:35.534
Hello.
Hey, James.

20:35.569 --> 20:37.002
It's Marty Kaan.

20:38.104 --> 20:39.504
Yeah, it has been a long time.

20:39.538 --> 20:41.539
Are you on the front nine
or the back nine right now?

20:41.574 --> 20:43.107
Yeah, of course.

20:43.566 --> 20:46.620
Hey, you guys still beating coke
in those blind taste tests?

20:46.816 --> 20:48.012
You are.
Guess what?

20:48.046 --> 20:49.380
Nobody cares.

20:50.649 --> 20:52.483
Yeah, thank you,
I am still a prick.

20:52.517 --> 20:53.951
Some things never change.

20:53.985 --> 20:55.920
But you're gonna love me
in about ten seconds.

20:55.954 --> 20:59.090
Listen, I just walked out
of a meeting at IBC,

20:59.124 --> 21:01.994
and they are about to go live
with a deeply-flawed E.R.P.

21:02.028 --> 21:05.398
And it's...

21:05.432 --> 21:07.667
Yeah, yeah.
That's right.

21:07.701 --> 21:09.702
Unstable would be
a very nice way to put it.

21:09.737 --> 21:11.604
Yes, against
Galweather's advice.

21:11.639 --> 21:12.905
So, listen,

21:12.940 --> 21:15.774
when you scoop this bitch up
for about 50 cents,

21:15.808 --> 21:17.776
we would love to come in there

21:17.810 --> 21:19.211
and pimp the place out for you.

21:19.245 --> 21:21.746
Yeah, we have
some sick tech solutions

21:21.780 --> 21:23.514
and some pretty enlightening
takeaways I think

21:23.549 --> 21:25.230
you're gonna want
to hear about.

21:25.783 --> 21:28.518
We will streamline
the whole thing, top to bottom,

21:28.552 --> 21:30.019
tell you who to keep,

21:30.053 --> 21:31.687
who to Jettison.

21:31.722 --> 21:33.022
Really?

21:33.057 --> 21:35.511
From the start-up
right on through.

21:36.193 --> 21:38.695
Yes, that is going to make
my partners hard.

21:38.729 --> 21:41.364
Shit, I already got half a boner
thinking about it.

21:41.398 --> 21:43.766
Absolutely, buddy.

21:43.801 --> 21:45.268
I will talk to you soon.

21:45.837 --> 21:47.438
Buh-bye.

21:48.739 --> 21:52.308
Let me see,
$3 million piece of business

21:52.343 --> 21:53.476
all before lunch.

21:53.510 --> 21:56.112
That's not too bad, right?

21:56.146 --> 21:59.148
- Unbe-fucking-lievable.

21:59.182 --> 22:00.282
Isn't it?

22:00.316 --> 22:01.283
You had this play
the entire time?

22:01.317 --> 22:02.451
You're welcome.

22:02.485 --> 22:05.187
Hold on.
No, no, guys, wait up.

22:05.221 --> 22:07.322
Hold on. Someone walk me
through what just happened.

22:12.729 --> 22:14.263
Hey, Doug.

22:14.297 --> 22:16.532
You know hooking up
with a tranny still counts

22:16.566 --> 22:18.467
towards your hook-up point
total, right?

22:18.502 --> 22:19.836
I get points?
I get full points?

22:19.870 --> 22:21.437
I can't believe
I'm gonna do this,

22:21.472 --> 22:23.572
but, yes, I will give you
full points.

22:23.607 --> 22:24.941
What do you got?

22:24.975 --> 22:28.311
All right, listen,
before I tell you anything,

22:28.345 --> 22:30.480
you need to know
that this is very personal.

22:30.514 --> 22:32.949
Of course it is.
Of course it is.

22:32.983 --> 22:35.018
I'm not kidding, Clyde.
You can't tell anybody.

22:35.052 --> 22:36.386
I won't tell anybody.

22:36.420 --> 22:38.321
You're like my brother.
You know that.

22:38.355 --> 22:39.923
So strictly between you and me?

22:39.957 --> 22:42.358
Yeah.
And Kiki.

22:43.196 --> 22:44.894
Come on.

22:48.532 --> 22:50.166
Yeah.
And Kiki.

22:51.334 --> 22:52.634
I mean...
It's not a big deal.

22:52.669 --> 22:54.203
I was embarrassed.
I don't know.

22:54.237 --> 22:56.438
- I'll be right back, okay?
- Okay.

22:56.472 --> 22:58.507
Excuse me,
ladies and gentlemen.

22:58.541 --> 22:59.774
What are you doing?

22:59.809 --> 23:02.144
I have a very important
announcement to make.

23:02.178 --> 23:03.479
No, no, no, no, no.

23:03.513 --> 23:05.914
My good friend and colleague
Douglas Guggenheim...

23:05.949 --> 23:07.115
Excuse me, my belt is stuck.

23:07.150 --> 23:09.051
Harvard MBA...

23:11.087 --> 23:12.421
Hey, dad.

23:12.455 --> 23:13.456
Hey, buddy.

23:13.490 --> 23:15.224
Hey, guys.
Hey.

23:15.258 --> 23:16.325
Hi.

23:17.397 --> 23:19.217
These two the...

23:21.198 --> 23:22.498
God help me.

23:26.498 --> 23:27.803
Hello.

23:27.838 --> 23:29.138
Sure, come on up.

23:30.040 --> 23:31.408
Skip Galweather.

23:31.442 --> 23:33.176
Dad, you told him to come up?

23:33.778 --> 23:35.083
Yeah.

23:35.257 --> 23:36.567
Everything okay?

23:37.099 --> 23:38.630
I'll let you know.

23:44.350 --> 23:45.739
Hey.
Hey.

23:45.823 --> 23:47.157
What's up, skip?

23:47.434 --> 23:48.810
You got a minute?

23:49.185 --> 23:53.464
So, Marty,
Greg Norbert has a hard-on

23:53.498 --> 23:55.433
for you that's epic.

23:55.467 --> 23:57.068
Yeah.

23:57.102 --> 23:58.570
If Metro reaches a consensus

23:58.604 --> 24:00.372
with the partners,

24:00.406 --> 24:03.042
he's gonna want to shove you out
without a parachute,

24:03.076 --> 24:04.377
and it's gonna be
a bumpy landing,

24:04.411 --> 24:06.412
what with
your non-compete clause.

24:06.446 --> 24:08.348
Yeah, well, you know,
just give me

24:08.382 --> 24:09.949
some cover on that,
right, skip?

24:11.575 --> 24:13.263
Why the fuck would I do that?

24:17.090 --> 24:18.223
I don't know.

24:18.257 --> 24:20.058
Because I've killed it
for Galweather

24:20.092 --> 24:21.396
since I took the job?

24:23.128 --> 24:25.700
It's a relationship business.

24:26.131 --> 24:27.431
We're pollinators.

24:27.465 --> 24:29.233
All right, we go
from flower to flower.

24:29.267 --> 24:30.267
We are very sweet.

24:30.302 --> 24:32.570
We gorge on the royal jelly,

24:32.604 --> 24:34.104
and then we quietly buzz off.

24:34.138 --> 24:35.639
We do not use our stingers.

24:35.673 --> 24:37.942
We are all about relationships.

24:37.977 --> 24:40.145
Other people do what you do
without leaving a swathe

24:40.179 --> 24:41.747
of destruction behind them.

24:42.116 --> 24:44.411
Yeah, your numbers are amazing.

24:45.224 --> 24:49.435
But then I... I am the one
left behind

24:49.482 --> 24:51.791
spending half my life
making nice

24:51.825 --> 24:54.227
with all the people
whose lives you've carved up

24:54.261 --> 24:55.428
and gutted.

24:55.462 --> 24:57.693
I like my garden peaceful
and quiet

24:58.341 --> 25:00.662
with big, beautiful,
blooming buds.

25:01.922 --> 25:03.795
Okay, skip, listen.

25:05.170 --> 25:07.771
Maybe my style points
leave something to be desired,

25:07.806 --> 25:09.177
yeah, granted.

25:09.808 --> 25:11.709
I'll try to do better.

25:11.743 --> 25:13.060
I'm sorry.

25:17.082 --> 25:18.583
You realize
how long I've known you

25:18.618 --> 25:22.193
and you've never once invited me
over here?

25:22.849 --> 25:24.159
Jesus Christ.

25:24.201 --> 25:25.615
Are you fucking serious?

25:26.960 --> 25:30.296
Skip, I have personally put
about $100 million

25:30.330 --> 25:31.630
in your pocket,

25:31.665 --> 25:33.763
let alone what I've done
for your company.

25:33.826 --> 25:35.868
This shit isn't personal.
All right?

25:35.902 --> 25:38.248
It's not about us
ever being friends here.

25:40.272 --> 25:41.818
It is to me.

25:43.042 --> 25:44.404
It's personal.

25:44.710 --> 25:45.843
To me.

25:45.877 --> 25:48.263
And that's
kind of what matters now.

25:48.680 --> 25:50.162
Isn't it?

26:18.077 --> 26:19.544
Hey, Clyde, what's up?

26:19.579 --> 26:21.098
Yeah, it's Marty.

26:22.048 --> 26:23.887
Hey, what are you doing
right now?

26:24.349 --> 26:25.653
Yeah?

26:26.486 --> 26:27.453
Well, fuck that.

26:27.487 --> 26:28.788
We're going out, man.

26:28.822 --> 26:30.689
I got, like, ten, homie.

26:30.723 --> 26:32.057
- Numbers?
- Yessir.

26:32.091 --> 26:33.492
I only got six...

26:33.526 --> 26:37.363
Teen...

26:37.397 --> 26:39.297
I think if I could have pumped
two more drinks in her,

26:39.332 --> 26:40.432
I could have closed.

26:40.466 --> 26:41.700
No, listen to me,
she was looking at me

26:41.734 --> 26:43.035
with those vagina eyes.

26:43.069 --> 26:44.636
"I need it."
You know what I needed?

26:44.670 --> 26:46.037
- Is the valet over here?
- Stun gun. Hold up.

26:46.071 --> 26:47.438
Wait a minute.
Is the valet over here?

26:47.473 --> 26:48.973
Yes, sir. Yes, sir.

26:49.008 --> 26:50.008
- What the hell's going on, man?
- Sorry, sir.

26:50.042 --> 26:52.210
Here you go.
Making me wait here.

26:52.245 --> 26:53.278
Sorry, sir.

26:53.313 --> 26:55.214
I want it right out front.

26:55.248 --> 26:57.283
Right out front.
Right out front. Yes, sir.

26:57.317 --> 26:58.919
That's okay.

27:00.354 --> 27:02.122
No.

27:02.156 --> 27:04.986
I'm not getting...
Get in this motherfucker, man.

27:10.499 --> 27:11.699
What do you think you're doing?

27:11.733 --> 27:13.567
Okay.

27:13.602 --> 27:15.503
Okay, okay, okay, slow down.

27:15.537 --> 27:17.672
Slow down.
Slow down, Marty.

27:17.706 --> 27:20.708
Marty, slow the fuck down.
Marty, slow the fuck down.

27:20.743 --> 27:22.110
What the fuck is wrong
with you, Marty?

27:22.144 --> 27:23.311
Slow the fuck down.

27:23.312 --> 27:25.416
Marty, slow down.
