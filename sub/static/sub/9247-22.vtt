00:04.526 --> 00:07.181
This isn't fair. Why do I have
to cut out these tulips?

00:07.268 --> 00:09.400
Same reason convicts have
to work in the prison laundry.

00:09.487 --> 00:12.403
Don't do the crime
if you can't do the time.

00:12.490 --> 00:14.927
- This is stupid.
- Quit saying "stupid."

00:15.015 --> 00:16.625
That's why your friends
are out riding bikes

00:16.712 --> 00:19.193

Hey, that kid said, "In 1982,
Columbus sailed the ocean blue."

00:23.501 --> 00:25.764
That doesn't give you the right
to call him stupid.

00:25.851 --> 00:29.942
I may have said it, but,
everybody else was thinking it.

00:30.030 --> 00:31.248
Well, you need to bite
your tongue

00:31.335 --> 00:34.208
and roll your eyes,
just like I do.

00:34.295 --> 00:35.774
My dad says
that's the reason

00:35.861 --> 00:38.299
this country's going
to hell in a hand basket.

00:38.386 --> 00:41.519
Your dad sounds
like a piece of work.

00:41.606 --> 00:43.391
Notice I said "piece of work"
instead of what

00:43.478 --> 00:45.828
I was really thinking.

00:45.915 --> 00:47.873
He says, "How else
are stupid people

00:47.960 --> 00:49.092

if we don't call them

00:49.179 --> 00:50.354

Hey, sweetie,
about ready to go?

00:55.577 --> 00:58.797
Uh, hello, officer.
I'm glad you came.

00:58.884 --> 01:01.322
This young man
needs to be taught a lesson.

01:01.409 --> 01:03.237
- You called the cops on me?
- 'Yes.'

01:03.324 --> 01:04.760
Miss Flynn asked me
to come down here

01:04.847 --> 01:06.675
and straighten out
a troublemaking delinquent.

01:06.762 --> 01:08.938
Officer Biggs,
this misguided youth

01:09.025 --> 01:11.506
addressed another student
with a very hurtful term.

01:11.593 --> 01:13.943
Ah, verbal assault.

01:14.030 --> 01:17.947
We in Chicago PD do not take
that sort of thing lightly.

01:18.034 --> 01:21.342
Now what was it? Four eyes,
shorty, stinky britches?

01:21.429 --> 01:24.301
Mike, it doesn't matter
what the actual word was.

01:24.388 --> 01:26.912
The point is that it hurt
another boy's feelings.

01:26.999 --> 01:30.525
He said, "In 1982, Columbus
sailed the ocean blue."

01:30.612 --> 01:32.440
Well, just 'cause
a kid's stupid doesn't mean

01:32.527 --> 01:33.571
you should call him names.

01:33.658 --> 01:35.312
Alright. Alright,
Lesson learned.

01:35.399 --> 01:37.575
Out. Go home.

I hope that scared you

That way,
I don't have to shower.

we could just take
a little break tonight.

in those things?

09:11.768 --> 09:12.943
You kidding me?

09:13.030 --> 09:14.728
Ostriches are the new gold!

09:14.815 --> 09:17.208
A few years from now,
people are gonna be saying

09:17.295 --> 09:19.820
"He's worth his weight
in ostrich meat."

09:22.910 --> 09:24.389
I don't know,
it's coming out of your mouth

09:24.476 --> 09:26.435
so it must be stupid.

09:26.522 --> 09:28.132
Fine.

09:28.219 --> 09:30.613
Enjoy living in a basement
for the rest of your life.

09:30.700 --> 09:33.137
Oh, and don't say anything
to Joyce about this.

09:33.224 --> 09:34.704
She's still on my back
for dropping

09:34.791 --> 09:36.793
all that money
on solar scooters.

09:36.880 --> 09:40.449
One kid's tennis shoes melt,
and everybody panics.

09:43.234 --> 09:45.280

09:45.367 --> 09:49.458
♪ Ee-i-ee-i-o ♪♪

09:49.545 --> 09:51.112
Alright, that needs work.

09:51.199 --> 09:54.245
Let's take five, hen we'll run
the whole show from the top.

09:54.332 --> 09:58.206
And pick up yo pace. I don't
care what you have to do.

09:58.293 --> 10:00.904
Sweet Tarts, Pixy Stix,
go to the gas station

10:00.991 --> 10:03.167
get a Red Bull.
I don't have to know!

10:03.254 --> 10:04.691
I just want this show
to sparkle!

10:04.778 --> 10:07.868
Trevor, you are all over the map
with the spotlights.

10:07.955 --> 10:09.521
It's like a prison break
up here.

10:09.609 --> 10:10.958
My arms are tired!

10:11.045 --> 10:13.874
Not as tired as they're gonna be
cutting tulips.

10:16.877 --> 10:19.227
This thing is gonna be a four
and a half hour train wreck.

10:19.314 --> 10:22.491
We're gonna have to lock
the doors from the outside.

10:22.578 --> 10:24.972
I'll slip a few bucks to the
fire marshal, we should be okay.

10:25.059 --> 10:27.539
No, he popped his head in last
year during The Happy Wanderer.

10:27.627 --> 10:30.717
He's not gonna be
anywhere near this place.

10:30.804 --> 10:32.632
It's gonna be fine.
It always works out.

10:32.719 --> 10:34.111
And these kids
really respond to you.

10:34.198 --> 10:35.983
Yeah.
They do, right?

10:36.070 --> 10:38.333
I've never seen
anything like it.

10:38.420 --> 10:40.944
Oh. Just, it's a natural
mothering instinct.

10:41.031 --> 10:44.513
You know, loving but firm.
Attentive but not overbearing.

10:44.600 --> 10:46.123
Everything a mother should have.

10:46.210 --> 10:49.649
Except a kid.
Damn my slow uterus!

10:51.389 --> 10:54.175
- You okay?
- Yup!

10:54.262 --> 10:56.656
Not now, Trevor!

11:06.970 --> 11:08.189
You know,
this is the third time

11:08.276 --> 11:09.930
we've picked you up
for indecent exposure.

11:10.017 --> 11:12.584
I'm starting to think you just
like riding in a car naked.

11:12.672 --> 11:13.977
Oh, how was I supposed to know

11:14.064 --> 11:17.154
that that place wasn't
a nude beach?

11:17.241 --> 11:19.504
Because it was indoors,
everybody was drinking coffee

11:19.591 --> 11:22.333
and they all had
their clothes on.

11:22.420 --> 11:24.205
Well, I'm not ashamed
of my body.

11:24.292 --> 11:25.902
From what I saw,
you should be.

11:25.989 --> 11:27.599
Those things was hanging down
like wind chimes.

11:27.687 --> 11:31.038
That's why
I had to get rid of my cat.

11:31.125 --> 11:33.867
Just sit back, shut up and keep
your butt on the blanket.

11:33.954 --> 11:37.044
Aye, aye, Captain Binghamton.

11:37.131 --> 11:39.655
I don't get it, Carl.
Molly's just given up.

11:39.742 --> 11:40.787
Guess I'm gonna
have to get used

11:40.874 --> 11:43.528
to the idea
of not being a dad.

11:43.615 --> 11:45.095
Well, that's a damn waste.

11:45.182 --> 11:46.618
A guy with a lap
that seats three kids

11:46.706 --> 11:48.708
ain't even gonna have one.

11:48.795 --> 11:49.970
You know, this whole time
we've been trying

11:50.057 --> 11:51.754
I thought I was
doing it for Molly.

11:51.841 --> 11:53.974
Now I realize
how much I want a kid.

11:54.061 --> 11:55.540
Of course you do.

11:55.627 --> 11:58.935
You want to teach him
how to ride a bike or play catch

11:59.022 --> 12:02.547
or grab the colder beers
from the back of the fridge.

12:02.634 --> 12:06.900
Actually, Carl, I always had
my heart set on a little girl.

12:06.987 --> 12:08.815
- A daughter?
- Yeah.

12:08.902 --> 12:10.904
I could see myself
telling her stories

12:10.991 --> 12:14.603
and walking her to school
and warning her about boys.

12:14.690 --> 12:16.344
Putting her hair
in pigtails

12:16.431 --> 12:18.215
holding her little hand
while she crosses the street.

12:18.302 --> 12:21.566
Be waiting for her when she got
home from her first date.

12:21.653 --> 12:23.699
And walking her down
the aisle when she got married.

12:23.786 --> 12:26.267
[sighs]
They grow up so quick.

12:27.529 --> 12:28.748
And no one can ever
break the bond

12:28.835 --> 12:30.053
between a father
and a daughter.

12:30.140 --> 12:31.098
No how, no way.

12:31.185 --> 12:32.142
Ah, she's always gonna be

12:32.229 --> 12:33.753
daddy's little girl forever.

12:33.840 --> 12:34.754
Hey, you know,
we could've built her

12:34.841 --> 12:36.016
a playhouse in the backyard.

12:36.103 --> 12:38.540
Had a tea party
on a tiny little table.

12:38.627 --> 12:41.369
"Would you like
some more cream, Uncle Carl?"

12:41.456 --> 12:44.198
"You bet I would, sunshine."

12:44.285 --> 12:46.548
I can't give up, Carl. That
little girl needs her daddy.

12:46.635 --> 12:49.507
And her Uncle Carl, too.

12:49.594 --> 12:51.422
Remind me to call my daughter
when I get home

12:51.509 --> 12:53.685
and tell her
how much I love her? Eah?

12:53.773 --> 12:57.124
And to meet me
at the police station...

12:57.211 --> 12:59.691
..with $200 bail money

12:59.779 --> 13:01.650
and a pair of pants.

13:02.782 --> 13:05.088
[instrumental music]

13:06.394 --> 13:07.917
This is a good
look for you.

13:08.004 --> 13:11.225
You might want to stick with
this even after the recital.

13:11.312 --> 13:13.923
Victoria, this is a barnyard,
not a brothel.

13:14.010 --> 13:16.404
- Cows don't wear lipstick.
- They don't tap-dance either.

13:16.491 --> 13:18.580
Let's not start
poking holes in reality.

13:18.667 --> 13:21.278
Alright, scoot. Go wipe that off
and put on your cowbell.

13:21.365 --> 13:22.540
And no more
glitter lipstick.

13:22.627 --> 13:25.239
Oh! She stresses me out.

13:25.326 --> 13:28.720
You don't smoke, do you?

13:28.808 --> 13:29.765
How are we doing?

13:29.852 --> 13:32.115
Oh, I think we're gonna be okay.

13:32.202 --> 13:35.118
Our banty rooster came down
with chicken pox, ironically

13:35.205 --> 13:38.078
but think the show
must go on, huh?

13:38.165 --> 13:39.470
I just want to say,
you've done

13:39.557 --> 13:40.820
a remarkable job
with this whole thing.

13:40.907 --> 13:42.952
Oh, well, you've been my rock.

13:43.039 --> 13:45.172
I mean,
if you weren't here, I think

13:45.259 --> 13:47.522
a couple of chickens would be
sleeping with the fishes.

13:47.609 --> 13:51.961
Miss Flynn, I think one
of the pigs pooped his pants.

13:52.048 --> 13:55.617
Perfect. Told you all to eat
light on show night!

13:59.447 --> 14:00.796
It's a big show tonight, huh?

14:00.883 --> 14:02.537
My brother's a donkey.

14:02.624 --> 14:04.495
So is my best friend.

14:04.582 --> 14:06.149
Sophie's my best friend.

14:06.236 --> 14:08.456
Oh, hi, Sophie.
Nice to meet you.

14:08.543 --> 14:10.850
- She's shy.
- Well, she just met me.

14:10.937 --> 14:12.286
She'll warm up to me.

14:12.373 --> 14:14.679
Can you hold my doll
so she can see?

14:14.766 --> 14:16.986
Absolutely.

14:17.073 --> 14:19.423
Is that better, Sophie?

14:19.510 --> 14:20.860
Well, thanks.

14:20.947 --> 14:22.644
I knew you'd
warm up to me.

14:24.776 --> 14:25.908
How's it going back there?

14:25.995 --> 14:27.344
I had to flirt
with one of the janitors

14:27.431 --> 14:30.478
so he'd give me
a drink of his moonshine.

14:30.565 --> 14:31.827
- Opening night jitters?
- No.

14:31.914 --> 14:33.524
Molly's driving
everybody crazy.

14:33.611 --> 14:36.658
I know she's your wife, but
she can be a real B-I-T-C-H.

14:36.745 --> 14:39.182
Hey, that's a bad word!

14:39.269 --> 14:40.967
Wow, you spell good.

14:41.054 --> 14:42.882
Give me my doll back.

14:45.580 --> 14:47.799
Real nice, potty mouth.

14:49.497 --> 14:51.412
Okay, it's a packed house.

14:51.499 --> 14:53.240
We're looking
at a packed house!

14:53.327 --> 14:56.286
Alright, we've worked
really hard to get here

14:56.373 --> 14:58.419
and it's been
a lot of hard nights

14:58.506 --> 15:00.247
and a few tears and some poop.

15:00.334 --> 15:01.813
But I know that

15:01.901 --> 15:04.555
as soon as your moms
and your dads see how hard

15:04.642 --> 15:05.774
you have worked,
that they're gonna be

15:05.861 --> 15:08.168
just as proud of you as I am.

15:08.255 --> 15:09.691
Okay, so go out there and shine.

15:09.778 --> 15:12.346
Shine like the little
stars I know you are.

15:13.434 --> 15:15.740
Go, go, go

15:15.827 --> 15:18.352
Oh, God, I'm glad
we're not charging admission.

15:20.963 --> 15:25.228
- Have a great opening night.
- Oh, that is so sweet.

15:25.315 --> 15:26.751
I really appreciate
all your help.

15:26.838 --> 15:28.188
Oh, it's been my pleasure.

15:28.275 --> 15:29.232
I've, uh, I've enjoyed

15:29.319 --> 15:30.277
the time we've spent together.

15:30.364 --> 15:32.844
It's been
really fun, huh?

15:32.932 --> 15:34.585
Oh! What are you doing?

15:34.672 --> 15:36.936
- I'm married.
- Sounded a little rocky.

15:37.023 --> 15:38.328
Oh, so you thought
you'd just step in

15:38.415 --> 15:40.069
and take advantage
of a vulnerable woman?

15:40.156 --> 15:41.375
No, no, that's not..

15:41.462 --> 15:42.898
Listen, pal, I love my husband.

15:42.985 --> 15:46.771
I mean, I'm flattered,
but what a dink move.

15:48.121 --> 15:49.774
I...I'm sorry
if I overstepped.

15:49.861 --> 15:52.429
Well, overstep your
ass to the piano

15:52.516 --> 15:55.867
and start tickling the ivories
before I start tickling yours!

Wow! I don't know what to say.

17:09.202 --> 17:11.639
It was not nearly as horrible
as I thought it was gonna be!

17:11.726 --> 17:13.510
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

17:13.597 --> 17:14.990
I only started
to doze off once.

17:15.077 --> 17:18.298
But then the silo fell over,
you had me to the end.

17:18.385 --> 17:21.040
Can I, uh, buy you
a little celebratory drink?

17:21.127 --> 17:24.869
No, but, uh, how about
we open a bottle of champagne

17:24.956 --> 17:26.393
and see where
the night takes us?

17:26.480 --> 17:28.134

ovulating anymore.

walk into the room.

He'll be here.

17:49.546 --> 17:51.070

to be here at 7:30.

17:51.157 --> 17:53.246
He's a hillbilly,
they tell time by the position

17:53.333 --> 17:55.422

the cows are facing.

thoughts about this, Vince.

Hey, we're not hurting
these animals.

18:02.342 --> 18:04.648

and letting them screw.

Tell me, if you were an ostrich,
you wouldn't want that gig?

19:00.835 --> 19:02.750
Don't push me, dueling banjos.

19:02.837 --> 19:04.143
Just pick us out some good birds

19:04.230 --> 19:07.494
and get back
to your cousin-wife.

19:07.581 --> 19:09.887
Hey, I scraped something
bigger than you off my boot

19:09.974 --> 19:12.412
this morning, and it smelled
better than you, too.

19:12.499 --> 19:14.153
When did you start
wearing shoes?

19:14.240 --> 19:17.156
Did your pappy go to town
and sell a pig?

19:18.592 --> 19:21.029
No. I shaved off
your mama's mustache

19:21.116 --> 19:24.293
and sold it to a wig store.

19:24.380 --> 19:26.339
Hang on a second. I-I thought
you guys were friends.

19:26.426 --> 19:31.039
We are. I'd take a bullet
for this baldheaded little wop.

19:31.126 --> 19:33.433
That goes double for me,
you dumb-ass cracker.

19:33.520 --> 19:35.478
By the way, you got
that 100 bucks you owe me?

19:35.565 --> 19:37.828
- I do now.
- Hey!

19:37.915 --> 19:39.482
Or we could double down.

19:39.569 --> 19:40.918
Let's roll, Jethro.

19:41.005 --> 19:42.398
Say, "One, two, three, go."

19:42.485 --> 19:43.791
One, two, three, go.

19:43.878 --> 19:45.488
Guys, I'm not really sure
about this.

19:45.575 --> 19:48.317
Hey, hee-haw,
is that your truck being towed?

19:48.404 --> 19:50.363
No, I ain't falling
for that one again.

19:50.450 --> 19:52.626
You know, maybe I should just
put this in a low-risk CD.

19:52.713 --> 19:55.498
You know, low-risk, minimal
return. No arm-wrestling!

20:01.809 --> 20:03.506
