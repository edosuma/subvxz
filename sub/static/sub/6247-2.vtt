01:22.680 --> 01:24.432
Bones! Over here.

01:24.520 --> 01:28.229
- Where have you been?
- There's a lot going on here.

01:28.320 --> 01:31.312
They're with me.
Dr Temperance Brennan, Angela Montenegro.

01:31.400 --> 01:34.119
- I need ID.
- Check the list. Homeland Security.

01:34.200 --> 01:36.714
She's the forensic anthropologist.

01:36.800 --> 01:40.190
- They're clear.
- Thanks. Come on.

01:40.280 --> 01:44.193
- God, what's that smell?
- Burnt flesh. Are there a lot of injuries?

01:44.280 --> 01:47.113
Four known dead, 15 injured.

01:47.200 --> 01:48.599
Oh, my God.

01:52.080 --> 01:53.832
Details. Whatever you have.

01:53.920 --> 01:58.232
Not much. Middle Eastern man, mid-30s,
pulled up to the café and the carjust blew.

01:58.320 --> 02:02.154
Registered to Hamid Masruk, head of
the Arab-American Friendship League.

02:02.240 --> 02:05.630
<i>- Why do you need me?
- We're hoping we're wrong.</i>

02:05.720 --> 02:08.871
Masruk is a White House consultant
on Arab relations.

02:08.960 --> 02:11.030
Had lunch with the president last week.

02:11.120 --> 02:14.351
Agent Gibson, Homeland Security.
Dr Temperance Brennan, Angela Montenegro.

02:14.440 --> 02:18.115
If Masruk was involved,
we have a huge nationaI security problem.

02:18.200 --> 02:22.591
Not to mention a very humiliated president.
The press is already running with this.

02:22.680 --> 02:27.231
- If you think I'm gonna alter my findings...
- Not at all. Maybe it's not Masruk.

02:27.320 --> 02:30.630
We need to be sure.
Booth says you're the best.

02:33.800 --> 02:38.191
I need gloves and masks for the retrievaI
team, medicaI bags and vegetable oiI.

02:38.280 --> 02:39.395
Vegetable oiI?

02:39.480 --> 02:44.634
The oiI will loosen the body parts stuck to
the metaI, like a steak on a grill that sticks.

02:44.720 --> 02:46.073
It's OK. I trust you.

02:46.160 --> 02:50.870
- Should I photograph the scene?
- Focus on a 30-meter radius from the blast.

02:55.440 --> 02:57.556
OK to pick up?

03:03.680 --> 03:08.276
- It's OK to be upset.
- I wish this is the worst thing I'd seen.

03:08.360 --> 03:12.592
You know, uh...
I don't think I can... Sorry.

03:19.840 --> 03:23.276
- Well, if you can't either...
- No, I'm cooI.

03:26.400 --> 03:28.470
Zack, I need two more evidence bags.

03:29.200 --> 03:32.351
FaciaI epidermis
and the fingertips are decimated.

03:32.440 --> 03:35.830
We can't ID anything from the flesh.
It's basically carbon.

03:35.920 --> 03:38.753
We're missing the lower left leg
and the lumbar spine.

03:38.840 --> 03:41.991
Here's C2 and the right ischium.

03:42.080 --> 03:45.709
Smokey had access to the president.
Why would he attack a café?

03:45.800 --> 03:47.836
- Smokey?
- It's how I deaI with stress.

03:47.920 --> 03:53.199
Targeting everyday places causes panic.
The economy is crippled. It's Terrorism 101.

03:53.280 --> 03:55.555
Take the clothes,
see what you can find.

03:55.640 --> 04:00.316
Cologne, laundry detergent -
anything we can link to Masruk's home.

04:00.400 --> 04:04.518
- I'll grab particulates to ID the bomb.
- Isn't that the FBI's job?

04:04.600 --> 04:09.037
You trust the FBI? They'll suppress
whatever they need to cover their asses.

04:09.120 --> 04:10.519
A portion of the clavicle.

04:10.600 --> 04:11.953
- Are you listening?
- No.

04:12.040 --> 04:16.430
They have a separate division
so their hands are always clean. In 1970...

04:16.519 --> 04:19.557
Jack! We're trying to work.

04:19.640 --> 04:22.996
Someone seems really defensive
about the FBI lately.

04:23.080 --> 04:27.278
- Booth is just a government stooge.
- This has nothing to do with Booth.

04:27.360 --> 04:30.875
I don't enjoy squints on my team
any more than you like me on yours.

04:30.960 --> 04:34.396
But we're supposed to be
working together, OK?

04:34.480 --> 04:37.472
Sure. So, what do we do?
Group hug?

04:37.560 --> 04:41.792
- Agent Gibson here will oversee things.
- I'll try not to be in the way.

04:41.880 --> 04:44.519
- We don't need to be overseen.
- It's not your call.

04:44.600 --> 04:49.196
- How soon can we get the DNA match?
- That'll take days. I can get a match sooner.

04:49.280 --> 04:54.035
<i>- You're gonna be able to ID him from that?
- Asking stuff like that is in the way.</i>

04:54.120 --> 05:00.195
Remove any flesh and particulates and then
macerate him - if that's all right with you.

05:04.000 --> 05:07.754
Don't touch the table.
Don't touch the table.

05:09.080 --> 05:12.834
- This is my lab. I'm a scientist, a doctor.
- So I've heard.

05:12.920 --> 05:16.151
Could you work if someone
was looking over your shoulder?

05:16.240 --> 05:20.438
- I've developed a tolerance.
- I don't see the advantage of compromise.

05:20.520 --> 05:23.557
It's a terrorist attack.
It's bigger than you and me.

05:23.640 --> 05:26.234
- The job is the same.
- No, it's not!

05:26.320 --> 05:29.278
We're dealing with someone
who devalues a culture,

05:29.360 --> 05:32.511
terrorising people
by using God to justify mass murder.

05:32.600 --> 05:34.636
You're making it personaI.

05:34.720 --> 05:38.952
It is personaI, Bones.
All of us die a little bit on one like this.

05:46.080 --> 05:51.552
All the trace evidence has been stripped.
Hodgins scavenged as much as he could.

05:51.640 --> 05:53.995
OK. Let's get started.

06:00.720 --> 06:03.393
What the hell are those?

06:03.480 --> 06:06.836
<i>Dermestes maculatus.</i>

06:08.480 --> 06:13.838
Flesh-eating beetles.
It's how we clean the bones of burn victims.

06:22.760 --> 06:23.749
Gibson.

06:23.840 --> 06:25.910
<i>- This is the president.
- Yes, sir.</i>

06:26.000 --> 06:30.391
<i>- We need this ID. Make this a priority.
- Yes, sir.</i>

06:32.240 --> 06:35.835
The president wants to know
how long the ID's gonna take.

06:35.920 --> 06:38.434
<i>Why don't you ask them?</i>

07:23.280 --> 07:27.193
You have made a mistake.
It can't be my husband.

07:27.280 --> 07:32.479
My brother was no terrorist.
He hated those people. Read his speeches.

07:32.560 --> 07:36.394
- We aren't making any accusations.
- It's all over the news.

07:36.480 --> 07:38.471
We can't controI the press.

07:38.560 --> 07:43.395
How about your men? They've searched
our house, talked to our friends.

07:43.480 --> 07:46.870
UntiI we can identify the body,
we have to investigate.

07:46.960 --> 07:49.030
So identify the body.

07:49.120 --> 07:52.715
The longer you wait...
Do you know what it's like for us?

07:52.800 --> 07:55.075
His body was fragmented by the blast.

07:55.160 --> 07:58.470
<i>We're still retrieving pieces...</i>

08:01.560 --> 08:05.348
I understand how difficult this is,
not knowing.

08:05.440 --> 08:09.274
I'll work as quickly as I can
to get you what you need.

08:09.360 --> 08:13.797
That's why I asked for his history. Where
he grew up, any injuries from his youth,

08:13.880 --> 08:15.393
medicaI records.

08:15.480 --> 08:17.948
Of course.

08:18.040 --> 08:21.191
I brought you what you asked for.

08:21.280 --> 08:23.191
Thank you.

08:24.000 --> 08:26.195
We lived just like you.

08:26.280 --> 08:30.637
We came to this country because we love it.
We are Americans.

08:30.720 --> 08:33.678
It can't be Hamid. It can't.

08:35.679 --> 08:38.831
My husband was not a terrorist.

08:44.880 --> 08:47.872
It could be a perchlorate.
Would that be used in a bomb?

08:47.960 --> 08:52.351
Yeah, but this is a crystalline structure,
aluminum-based.

08:53.400 --> 08:56.312
OK, I'm back. How are we doing?

08:56.400 --> 09:00.359
I have his detergent brand, cologne,
shampoo. He died a well-groomed man.

09:00.440 --> 09:01.953
- Thanks.
- Dr Brennan...

09:02.040 --> 09:05.191
- The bones done yet?
- I'll check the beetles.

09:05.280 --> 09:06.918
Whatever you have there...

09:07.000 --> 09:10.675
It's a piece of paper
with some writing on it.

09:18.280 --> 09:20.589
Hard at work?

09:20.680 --> 09:22.671
There's a shocker.

09:24.160 --> 09:26.151
I just saw his wife.

09:26.240 --> 09:30.028
She gave me his medicaI records,
photographs.

09:30.560 --> 09:34.439
Apparently he was ill.
They were testing for lupus.

09:34.520 --> 09:37.353
Which would explain the face.

09:37.440 --> 09:39.396
Must've been painfuI.

09:41.560 --> 09:43.994
Look, I...

09:44.080 --> 09:50.428
I know that you needed help out there at
the crime scene, and I wanted to, but...

09:50.520 --> 09:52.112
It's OK.

09:54.360 --> 10:00.310
You see it. I don't any more.
I don't know what's worse.

10:01.000 --> 10:03.070
You holding up OK?

10:05.160 --> 10:10.154
His wife doesn't believe it was him.
I've gotta give her an ID.

10:10.240 --> 10:13.198
Whatever I can do.

10:13.280 --> 10:15.430
Yeah, I know.

10:15.520 --> 10:18.193
- And about this weekend...
- I don't know.

10:18.280 --> 10:22.239
Come on. I know this great club.
They play trip hop and trance.

10:22.320 --> 10:25.232
- I don't know what that means.
- We'll grab Booth.

10:25.320 --> 10:26.992
- No.
- I think he likes you.

10:27.080 --> 10:29.355
If I were you, I'd buy
a ticket on that ride.

10:29.440 --> 10:33.353
I'll be busy this weekend.
Even after the ID, I have these.

10:33.440 --> 10:34.953
Remains from World War I?

10:35.040 --> 10:38.350
That's what the Institute pays me for.
I've got hundreds of these.

10:38.440 --> 10:41.557
And they can't wait one more weekend?

10:41.640 --> 10:45.315
They've got relatives.
They've waited long enough.

10:45.400 --> 10:47.516
It's not that scary, Brennan.

10:47.600 --> 10:50.717
You have a few drinks,
you move to the music.

10:50.800 --> 10:53.360
You might even smile.

10:55.400 --> 10:57.470
The bones are clean.

10:57.560 --> 11:02.076
I've gotta run.
You hang around. I may need you.

11:04.840 --> 11:09.755
Comparing remains to details
provided of Hamid Masruk.

11:09.840 --> 11:13.628
Age 37, of Afghani origin.

11:13.720 --> 11:19.636
Texture of pubic symphysis indicates age of
bone consistent with Masruk, as is height.

11:19.720 --> 11:25.113
Complexity of craniaI vault sutures matches
the statisticaI probability of Eurasian descent.

11:25.200 --> 11:29.432
Too bad we can't tell why he did it.
Isn't that what we all want to know?

11:29.520 --> 11:34.150
Uneven growth patterns in the vertebrae
indicate malnourishment as a child.

11:34.240 --> 11:39.234
Consistent with the diet where Masruk
was from. Probably evident on the calvarium?

11:39.320 --> 11:42.153
Why don't you reconstruct the skull,
check it out.

11:42.240 --> 11:45.118
My first craniaI reconstruction.

11:46.280 --> 11:50.239
Evidence of multiple fractures
to the bottoms of the feet.

11:50.320 --> 11:57.271
Consistent with methods of torture used
in Afghanistan and with Masruk's history.

11:57.360 --> 12:00.830
I'm convinced. We have a statisticaI match.

12:00.920 --> 12:03.354
- So Masruk is the bomber?
- Yes.

12:03.440 --> 12:09.072
- What about the skull he's reconstructing?
- He wants to learn. Is that OK with you?

12:09.160 --> 12:14.109
For a forensic ID, we have all we need.
Now I'd like to get this data to Booth.

12:14.200 --> 12:16.589
- I'll take it.
- No, I don't think so.

12:16.680 --> 12:18.989
I work with Booth. That's my deaI.

12:19.080 --> 12:21.196
Dr Brennan, I have jurisdiction.

12:21.280 --> 12:26.638
<i>Then why don't I destroy my notes and let
you guarantee the identity of the remains?</i>

12:28.600 --> 12:33.435
It's best to just ride it
out... like an earthquake.

12:41.000 --> 12:43.036
- Bones.
- Yeah.

12:43.120 --> 12:45.998
- Did we have an appointment?
- No. I...

12:46.080 --> 12:49.834
It's him. Masruk is the bomber.

12:53.760 --> 12:57.309
I guess the wife didn't know
the husband very well.

12:57.400 --> 12:58.992
Hey.

13:01.520 --> 13:03.431
Hi. Sorry.

13:03.520 --> 13:07.035
Tessa, this is Brennan.
Tessa Jankow, Dr Temperance Brennan.

13:07.120 --> 13:08.917
Oh, hi.

13:09.000 --> 13:12.072
- I've heard a lot about you.
- Really?

13:13.720 --> 13:17.998
- Tessa's an attorney.
- Corporate. Keeping the fat cats fat.

13:18.080 --> 13:24.428
I was studying a craniaI fissure on a corporate
attorney last week. Of course, he was... dead.

13:24.520 --> 13:27.398
- Interesting.
- Thanks.

13:31.600 --> 13:36.515
The Bureau. I was just heading there. Santana
called, said something about the bombing.

13:36.600 --> 13:40.275
And I thought you were at the lab.
Maybe you should come.

13:40.360 --> 13:43.397
- Sure.
- See you later?

13:51.440 --> 13:55.149
- What is so funny?
- I never figured you'd be in a relationship.

13:55.240 --> 13:56.719
Why? What's wrong with me?

13:56.800 --> 14:01.999
Not wrong. You have alpha-male attributes
associated with a solitary existence.

14:02.080 --> 14:05.550
<i>- Me? Y ou're solitary.
- We weren't talking about me.</i>

14:05.640 --> 14:08.200
- I was.
- I wasn't. Look, I'm happy for you.

14:08.280 --> 14:12.796
Relationships have anthropologicaI meaning.
No society can survive if sexuaI bonds...

14:12.880 --> 14:16.634
- What the hell are you talking about?
- Booth? You got that ID?

14:16.720 --> 14:19.871
- Yeah. It was Masruk.
- That's too bad.

14:19.960 --> 14:24.875
- He killed four people and injured 15.
- The report came back from Ballistics.

14:24.960 --> 14:28.953
The explosives were under the car
with a trigger connected to the odometer.

14:29.040 --> 14:32.112
- Masruk was murdered.
- So Masruk wasn't a terrorist.

14:32.200 --> 14:35.317
Somebody tried to make him
look like one. Any leads on who?

14:35.400 --> 14:38.676
That's why we're paying you, Booth.

14:45.000 --> 14:47.514
We're very sorry, Mrs Masruk.

14:47.600 --> 14:53.470
I told you Hamid was the victim, but
you couldn't imagine a peace-loving Arab.

14:53.560 --> 14:55.471
- That's not true.
- No?

14:55.560 --> 15:01.112
"We must investigate everything because
we believe your husband was a good man. "

15:01.200 --> 15:02.553
Is that the truth?

15:02.640 --> 15:06.918
No. They searched your house because
Muslim extremists declared war on the US.

15:07.000 --> 15:10.037
Preliminary findings
made your husband a suspect...

15:10.120 --> 15:13.635
It's not Bureau policy
to target or profile any ethnic group.

15:13.720 --> 15:17.190
It wasn't our intention.
We understand why you're offended.

15:17.280 --> 15:18.315
- I can't.
- Bones!

15:18.400 --> 15:22.154
What? She's been a part
of a criminaI investigation.

15:22.240 --> 15:26.358
It's unfortunate
her husband's ethnicity is a factor,

15:26.440 --> 15:28.556
but to say it isn't is disingenuous.

15:28.640 --> 15:35.239
- I have to apologise for Dr Brennan.
- It's fine. Honesty is always a welcome relief.

15:36.040 --> 15:39.510
So when can I bury him?
When can I give him peace?

15:39.600 --> 15:43.991
There are body parts I'm still examining.
Others are still seared to...

15:44.080 --> 15:47.516
I'm sure Mrs Masruk
doesn't need to know the details.

15:47.600 --> 15:53.277
If I can retrieve more remains of her
husband, Muslim law requires that I do.

15:53.360 --> 15:58.354
I spent some time in
Iraq identifying bodies.

15:58.440 --> 16:04.959
I'll give you whatever I can so
that he can be purified for buriaI.

16:05.040 --> 16:07.759
Thank you.

16:07.840 --> 16:09.990
Is that all?

16:10.080 --> 16:14.153
One last thing. A few calls
were made to his cell phone

16:14.240 --> 16:16.754
from your house minutes before the blast.

16:16.840 --> 16:22.153
Yes. We argued. It was a family matter.

16:22.240 --> 16:26.791
My finaI words to him were words of anger.

16:26.880 --> 16:30.236
I'm very sorry. It must be very painfuI.

16:30.320 --> 16:33.676
You look very happy in that picture.

16:33.760 --> 16:36.069
Yes.

16:37.680 --> 16:43.630
Thank you. If there's anything else
that you can think of, just give us a call.

16:46.760 --> 16:49.115
I think she's having an affair...

16:50.680 --> 16:52.750
personally.

16:53.280 --> 16:57.353
- She was having an affair.
- That's an offensive assumption.

16:57.440 --> 16:58.953
All the signs are there.

16:59.040 --> 17:02.271
You can't make wild accusations
based on a feeling.

17:02.360 --> 17:08.276
That photograph is evidence as solid as
the markers you pick up looking at bones.

17:08.359 --> 17:12.433
The evidence I find is empiricaI.
Your evidence is conjecture.

17:12.520 --> 17:18.755
She dyed her hair, lost weight, used Botox.
She's still feeling guilty over their last fight.

17:18.839 --> 17:23.038
You are an insufferable, arrogant... man!

17:23.119 --> 17:26.907
I thought women wanted us
to understand them.

17:27.000 --> 17:29.833
A magician never wants to reveaI her tricks.

17:29.920 --> 17:31.831
- This is private.
- I'm not here.

17:31.920 --> 17:35.833
You think you know women just because
you live with some sexy lawyer?

17:35.920 --> 17:39.037
- You live with a sexy lawyer?
- She has her own place.

17:39.120 --> 17:43.159
He thinks because Masruk's wife
had a makeover, she was having an affair.

17:43.240 --> 17:46.755
- I'm with him.
- There is no concrete proof.

17:46.840 --> 17:48.319
- Boobs perkier?
- Mm-hm.

17:48.400 --> 17:51.278
If you're so sure,
why didn't you confront her?

17:51.360 --> 17:53.828
If her boyfriend were involved,
she'd warn him.

17:53.920 --> 17:56.639
- Very good.
- I'm a constant surprise.

17:56.720 --> 18:01.475
All right, great. I will be in the lab
getting us some reaI data.

18:01.560 --> 18:06.554
So, how many nights a week
does "sexy" sleep over?

18:14.240 --> 18:17.949
- How is it coming?
- The fragments won't piece together.

18:18.040 --> 18:21.237
<i>I'd like to return the remains to the widow
before her demise.</i>

18:21.320 --> 18:27.668
I'm doing my best. The integrity of the bone
is compromised. Whether it's from the blast...

18:27.760 --> 18:30.558
I examined the chemicals
used in the explosives.

18:30.640 --> 18:32.790
They can have a degenerative effect.

18:32.880 --> 18:35.758
Not this quickly. Excuse me.

18:39.720 --> 18:44.157
Unusually soft bone tissue.
This has nothing to do with the blast.

18:44.240 --> 18:47.357
I owe you an apology, Zack.
Do you have his medicals?

18:51.840 --> 18:55.594
Stiffjoints, faciaI disfigurement.

18:55.680 --> 18:59.036
There's a trabecular pattern
his doctors couldn't have seen.

18:59.120 --> 19:00.872
Could be a degenerative disease.

19:00.960 --> 19:03.679
How does his condition
figure into the murder?

19:03.760 --> 19:09.198
Now it's a murder. Before, it was terrorism
because we didn't have all the facts.

19:09.280 --> 19:11.271
Check for lupus and Paget's.

19:11.360 --> 19:13.351
- Got enough tissue?
- I can manage.

19:13.440 --> 19:18.434
He might've been exposed to a toxin,
which would mean his brother was, too.

19:18.520 --> 19:22.911
He's exhibiting similar symptoms.
I'll get the brother's medicals.

19:23.000 --> 19:25.992
I graduated top of my class, Rhodes scholar,

19:26.080 --> 19:28.719
youngest in the Academy
of PhysicaI Sciences,

19:28.800 --> 19:30.916
but she still makes me feeI like a cretin.

19:31.000 --> 19:32.752
She apologised to me.

19:41.600 --> 19:44.114
Yes, I am a Christian.

19:44.200 --> 19:48.671
- And Hamid is Muslim. And Sahar?
- I converted.

19:48.760 --> 19:53.276
Hamid could never accept it. Religious
differences cause too many problems.

19:53.360 --> 19:56.670
It seems to be
a consistent fact throughout history.

19:56.760 --> 19:58.432
Please.

19:59.400 --> 20:02.836
I tried to make peace with my brother,
but it was difficult.

20:02.920 --> 20:05.229
There was more than religion between us.

20:05.320 --> 20:09.996
- Sahar mentioned some family problems.
- Yes.

20:10.080 --> 20:15.916
- I can understand how delicate that can be.
- Did she tell you any more than that?

20:16.000 --> 20:22.473
No. But if you have any other information
that could help us in the investigation...

20:22.560 --> 20:23.754
It's not my place.

20:23.840 --> 20:27.879
We're just trying to find out
who killed your brother.

20:30.760 --> 20:35.197
Sahar was seeing another man.
But I can't believe she'd hurt my brother.

20:35.280 --> 20:39.273
Do you know who this other man is,
or is itjust a feeling you have?

20:39.360 --> 20:44.593
I've met him. Ali Ladjavardi. He worked
with Hamid at the Friendship League.

20:44.680 --> 20:46.875
I wanted Hamid to confront Ladjavardi.

20:46.960 --> 20:51.875
- Did you both have contact with Ladjavardi?
- Yes, once. A meaI.

20:51.960 --> 20:55.999
I brought Hamid to meet him.
Sharing a meaI is a gesture of peace.

20:56.080 --> 21:01.438
I was trying to save their marriage.
But they were not gonna stop their affair.

21:01.520 --> 21:05.069
- So I told Hamid to repudiate her.
- Sorry?

21:05.160 --> 21:08.152
<i>In Muslim law
it's a method of divorce called talak.</i>

21:08.240 --> 21:10.231
I still respected his traditions.

21:10.320 --> 21:14.836
You and your brother seem
to share a medicaI condition.

21:15.760 --> 21:17.910
Yes. Why is that important?

21:18.000 --> 21:22.790
She's just trying to figure out the
condition. It's part of the investigation.

21:22.880 --> 21:24.996
- Have you seen a doctor?
- Yes.

21:25.080 --> 21:29.870
He believes it's genetic. He was gonna
call Hamid's physician to discuss it.

21:29.960 --> 21:32.633
Would you mind if we saw
your medicaI records?

21:32.720 --> 21:37.635
Of course not.
If I could be helped, I welcome it.

21:43.320 --> 21:47.029
Apparently they live together
a few days a week.

21:47.120 --> 21:49.793
But he was very clear
that she has her own place.

21:49.880 --> 21:53.270
- Should you be intruding into their lives?
- Yeah. Absolutely.

21:53.360 --> 21:57.592
Negative for lupus and Paget's. I'll do
a scraping for environmentaI contaminants.

21:57.680 --> 22:01.275
I found these -
flecks caught onto the torn edges of bone.

22:01.360 --> 22:06.559
- I still think Brennan has a shot with Booth.
- She says she's not interested.

22:06.640 --> 22:10.997
- Methinks the lady doth protest too much.
- Maybe she protesteth just enough.

22:11.080 --> 22:14.072
Please. She's been
sleeping alone for months.

22:14.160 --> 22:18.073
She has enough pent-up sexuaI energy
to power a small Midwestern city.

22:18.160 --> 22:22.551
This looks like gypsum.
It wouldn't cause any organic damage.

22:22.640 --> 22:25.950
It was probably used
to insulate the explosives.

22:26.040 --> 22:28.793
I bet the FBI doesn't know that yet.

22:28.880 --> 22:33.192
I'm gonna go check out this girlfriend.

22:36.720 --> 22:42.431
<i>I'm not proud of the affair. I admired Hamid.
But Sahar and I are in love. I can't change it.</i>

22:42.520 --> 22:45.193
- You had access to his car.
- That's ridiculous.

22:45.280 --> 22:49.910
You also had contact with his brother,
who said you weren't friendly with Hamid.

22:50.000 --> 22:54.278
Have you been in the middle of a messy
relationship? Or are you a perfect man?

22:54.360 --> 22:59.195
- I'd prefer to ask the questions.
- I have the right to an attorney.

22:59.280 --> 23:03.193
Of course. I would never
deny anyone his rights.

23:03.840 --> 23:05.751
Mr Ladjavardi?

23:05.840 --> 23:10.277
I'm Agent Santana. We're sorry for
the inconvenience. You're free to go.

23:10.360 --> 23:11.554
Thank you.

23:13.800 --> 23:16.360
- You're finished.
- He was a prime suspect.

23:16.440 --> 23:20.433
He's a mole for Homeland Security.
They planted him in the League.

23:20.520 --> 23:22.112
He admitted the affair.

23:22.200 --> 23:24.555
<i>Homeland Security says he's clean.</i>

23:24.640 --> 23:27.996
- They do not want his cover blown.
- But, sir...

23:28.080 --> 23:31.629
Do I look like I'm discussing this?

23:43.240 --> 23:45.470
- Come on.
- You want me to drive?

23:45.560 --> 23:49.473
- No. Why?
- You're angry.

23:49.560 --> 23:52.677
- I'm not angry.
- You're gonna kill somebody.

23:52.760 --> 23:56.230
I'm not angry. Believe me,
you do not want to see me angry.

23:56.320 --> 24:00.074
- This is me accepting reality.
- OK. My mistake.

24:00.160 --> 24:05.518
My superiors make the decisions. If they don't
think them through, that's not my problem.

24:05.600 --> 24:10.754
If I were you, I'd be mad. They're preventing
you from doing a proper investigation.

24:10.840 --> 24:14.116
I'm a grown-up. I'll deaI.

24:14.200 --> 24:18.751
You know the thing where you ask for the
strength to change the things that you can

24:18.840 --> 24:21.673
and the wisdom to know the difference?

24:21.760 --> 24:24.354
- Not really.
- Well, it's a good thing.

24:24.440 --> 24:26.158
- Who do you ask?
- For what?

24:26.240 --> 24:30.597
- For the strength and the wisdom.
- God.

24:30.680 --> 24:34.195
- And it works?
- Can we talk about something else?

24:34.280 --> 24:37.113
- Sure. Tessa?
- No. Why do you want to talk about Tessa?

24:37.200 --> 24:39.998
Why not? I'm sorry.
We won't talk about Tessa.

24:40.080 --> 24:44.710
I prefer if we just talk about things
you like to talk about, like dead bodies.

24:44.800 --> 24:48.031
Sure. You killed a lot of people
when you were a sniper?

24:48.120 --> 24:50.759
- Maybe we shouldn't talk.
- Cos you're angry.

24:50.840 --> 24:53.593
I'm not angry. I'm not.

24:55.440 --> 25:01.436
We'll find out who killed him, Booth.
We've got Hamid's body.

25:04.040 --> 25:06.600
You can always count on the dead.

25:09.080 --> 25:11.878
I want the brother's medicals
matched to Hamid's.

25:11.960 --> 25:13.871
I'm starting on a tox screen.

25:13.960 --> 25:19.034
The doctor suspected a genetic condition.
Are we overlooking something? What's that?

25:19.120 --> 25:23.591
We used the trace elements to
rebuild the bomb. It might give you a link.

25:23.680 --> 25:27.070
- Isn't the FBI working on that?
- Yes. This is just for fun.

25:27.160 --> 25:30.869
- To see who's better?
- Maybe. A little. Yeah.

25:34.280 --> 25:36.271
Nice job.

25:40.840 --> 25:45.311
No wonder you had such trouble. Look
at the spread of the trabecular pattern.

25:45.400 --> 25:48.437
- Microscopic fissures, like cracks.
- I knew that.

25:48.520 --> 25:50.715
- I don't think so.
- Can we focus?

25:50.800 --> 25:55.635
The spread is too rapid for any bone disease
or genetic condition. It's definitely a toxin.

25:55.720 --> 25:59.793
- Is there any surviving marrow to test?
- I'll try and find some.

25:59.880 --> 26:01.871
Let's do it.

26:47.560 --> 26:50.518
The marrow's degraded.
I can give you basics.

26:50.600 --> 26:55.799
- The liver function was impaired.
- His body was trying to get rid of the poison.

26:55.880 --> 26:59.634
- There is trouble in paradise.
- I beg your pardon?

26:59.720 --> 27:02.234
Tessa does not feeI secure
in that relationship.

27:02.320 --> 27:04.675
- She's threatened by you.
- You talked to her?

27:04.760 --> 27:09.880
Even though she has a phenomenaI figure,
she was chowing down on a fat-free muffin.

27:09.960 --> 27:15.956
And she was reading a book about unsolved
FBI cases. She's obviously feeling insecure.

27:16.040 --> 27:18.554
- She's spying for you?
- No! No.

27:18.640 --> 27:23.270
It's difficult to sublimate
intense sexuaI attraction.

27:23.360 --> 27:25.794
- And we hear it's been a while.
- OK, stop.

27:25.880 --> 27:31.477
- He is there for the taking, honey.
- OK, I couldn't get his medicaI records.

27:33.480 --> 27:36.040
- What?
- Uh, nothing.

27:36.120 --> 27:40.955
- Trying to track down the doctor?
- It's a toxin. We can't determine what kind.

27:41.040 --> 27:44.191
Too bad the liver is cooked.
That could tell us everything.

27:44.280 --> 27:46.077
I need subtitles in here.

27:46.160 --> 27:50.551
The liver is like a filter. It would contain
evidence of any toxins in his system.

27:50.640 --> 27:53.438
But we don't have the liver
or any of the flesh left.

27:53.520 --> 27:56.512
But we do have the beetles.

27:57.800 --> 28:02.237
They ate Hamid's flesh and whatever
organs remained. And you are what you eat.

28:02.320 --> 28:08.555
- So you can ID the poison from the beetles.
- You can't kill them. They have names.

28:08.640 --> 28:12.189
We have to, Zack. Some.

28:18.400 --> 28:23.428
In Thailand, they're
sautéed in peanut oiI. Mm.

28:37.160 --> 28:40.948
We're gonna have to run a simulation.
Input the skull and give me a face.

28:41.040 --> 28:42.234
You got it.

28:42.320 --> 28:45.437
No more talk about Booth.
You shouldn't have got involved.

28:45.520 --> 28:49.195
- That's what friends are for.
- Please, Angela.

28:49.280 --> 28:50.998
Hey. Where'd you get this?

28:51.080 --> 28:56.552
I'm building it. TheoreticaI construct of
the bomb based on particulates we gathered.

28:56.640 --> 28:58.790
This isn't yourjob. Bureau's doing this.

28:58.880 --> 29:02.395
Got it! They were poisoned by dioxin,
a very pure form.

29:02.480 --> 29:08.157
It'd stay in the system for years and cause
the faciaI cysts and bone degeneration we saw.

29:08.240 --> 29:12.518
Give me the levels. Angela can use it in
simulation to give us a date of ingestion.

29:12.600 --> 29:16.115
- How much would it take to poison them?
- Just a little in the food.

29:16.200 --> 29:18.430
Like at that lunch with Sahar's lover.

29:18.520 --> 29:20.511
Impressed?

29:25.760 --> 29:30.914
Dioxin levels were 5600 parts per trillion.

29:31.000 --> 29:35.278
Speed of bone degeneration is an 88%
increase over baseline osteoporosis.

29:35.360 --> 29:40.354
- Date of death was...
- I remember that one. Thanks.

29:40.440 --> 29:43.000
Run the scenario.

29:47.800 --> 29:52.828
- I'll never get used to this.
- Yeah? Chicks with toys?

29:56.760 --> 29:58.239
<i>Poor bastard.</i>

29:58.320 --> 30:03.235
Match it to his INS photographs.
See how accurate you are.

30:03.320 --> 30:05.709
Good work, Angela.

30:10.520 --> 30:16.789
Probable date of exposure, about four
months ago. I'd say first week in June.

30:18.160 --> 30:21.869
Let's go pay a little
visit to Mr Ladjavardi.

30:29.960 --> 30:35.034
- I thought you were to stay away from him.
- As an FBI agent, I can't disobey my superior.

30:35.120 --> 30:37.111
But you're not an FBI agent.

30:37.200 --> 30:40.112
Hey! Hi. How are you doing?

30:40.960 --> 30:45.875
- What are you doing here? You had orders.
- I just have a couple of quick questions.

30:45.960 --> 30:50.033
Look, I'm not involved in this.
Sahar won't even talk to me any more.

30:50.120 --> 30:52.031
Yeah. I wonder why.

30:52.120 --> 30:54.839
- I'm calling Santana.
- Yeah, I don't think so.

30:54.920 --> 30:57.832
- I'm warning you.
- I wouldn't threaten her if I were you.

30:57.920 --> 31:02.277
I just want to know where you were in June,
to see if you poisoned Hamid and Farid.

31:02.360 --> 31:05.796
- Subtle.
- I'm leaving. That's it.

31:10.360 --> 31:13.955
- Told you. She doesn't like to be touched.
- I didn't poison anybody.

31:14.040 --> 31:18.591
- Then tell me where you were in June.
- In Utah for training with Homeland Security.

31:18.680 --> 31:22.912
I didn't get to DC untiI August 12th.
Check with the department.

31:24.560 --> 31:27.074
All right. Thanks.

31:31.160 --> 31:36.678
The insulation they used is gypsum-based
with plaster and lead mixed with asbestos.

31:36.760 --> 31:43.438
Pyrobar. It's a fireproof tile developed
in 1903. It was only used for a few years.

31:43.520 --> 31:46.432
It's from the building
the bomb was constructed in.

31:46.520 --> 31:50.479
We find the building
and we find the bomber.

31:50.720 --> 31:54.076
How about this? Sahar wants out
of the marriage, Hamid refuses.

31:54.160 --> 31:57.277
So Sahar poisons him
so she can run off with Ladjavardi.

31:57.360 --> 32:00.670
- It doesn't make sense.
- The first suspect is the spouse.

32:00.760 --> 32:05.356
- Hamid's brother, did she poison him too?
- He's pushing his nose into the marriage.

32:05.440 --> 32:09.149
Sahar is facing a devout Muslim
and a fundamentalist Christian.

32:09.240 --> 32:12.312
Nobody allows divorce.
She's pushed to murder.

32:12.400 --> 32:15.153
- That eschews logic.
- Come on, Bones. Work with me.

32:15.240 --> 32:19.279
It's what we call "positing a scenario".
Don't use the word "eschew".

32:19.360 --> 32:22.591
- What if you and Tessa were to break up?
- I don't want to.

32:22.680 --> 32:26.673
I'm positing a scenario. Tessa wants to
break up, you don't, so she poisons you.

32:26.760 --> 32:29.877
- No, no.
- Then, to make sure, she blows you up.

32:29.960 --> 32:32.428
- Why would Tessa do that?
- Exactly. Thank you.

32:32.520 --> 32:35.876
- That's a bad example.
- You're a couple in love, right?

32:35.960 --> 32:38.076
Why do you keep bringing up Tessa?

32:38.160 --> 32:42.073
What's the big deaI? Is it so odd for you
that I have someone in my life?

32:42.160 --> 32:44.674
Talking about couples, it's a naturaI segue.

32:44.760 --> 32:51.313
You have to quit using the word
"segue" and "eschew". They sound French.

32:51.400 --> 32:55.234
You keep changing the subject.
You're sensitive about you and Tessa.

32:55.320 --> 32:58.437
- Why don't we talk about your boyfriend?
- I don't have one.

32:58.520 --> 33:04.868
You just said that as though it's a good thing.
It's a very sad comment on your personaI life.

33:04.960 --> 33:08.669
<i>Look, you're angry again.</i>

33:08.760 --> 33:09.795
Brennan.

33:09.880 --> 33:13.634
The bomb insulation was made from Pyrobar,
used by a William Allard.

33:13.720 --> 33:18.316
He was known for developing the
Woodley Park neighbourhood around 1910.

33:18.400 --> 33:23.155
- The bomb was made in Woodley Park.
- That's where Farid lives.

33:23.240 --> 33:24.434
Hold on.

33:27.440 --> 33:33.072
He knew what was poisoning him. Stay
in contact with your boys. We'll need 'em.

33:33.160 --> 33:39.110
We're heading into a very unknown situation. I
think it's best that you just stay in the car.

33:39.200 --> 33:43.671
OK. Then if you have to come in with me,
you stay behind me.

33:43.760 --> 33:46.638
Fine. Just be carefuI, all right?

33:47.840 --> 33:51.833
OK. Anybody asks, that door was open.
Stay right here.

33:51.920 --> 33:54.115
FBI, Farid!

33:55.160 --> 33:57.833
Show yourself.

33:57.920 --> 33:59.717
OK.

34:04.400 --> 34:05.389
Clear.

34:05.480 --> 34:08.074
<i>- OK, give me Hodgins.
- Y eah.</i>

34:08.159 --> 34:10.355
<i>Farid was making something here.</i>

34:10.440 --> 34:15.878
- I got melted plastic, bottles of chlorine.
- Dioxin. That's how you'd make it.

34:15.960 --> 34:17.598
- Bones!
- Yes?

34:17.679 --> 34:21.911
Insulation. Farid definitely made the bomb.
He killed his brother.

34:22.000 --> 34:23.592
- Stay with me, Hodgins.
- Yeah.

34:23.679 --> 34:27.150
Hamid must've been killed cos
he found his brother making dioxin.

34:27.239 --> 34:29.549
That's probably how they got contaminated.

34:29.639 --> 34:35.158
Come on. Mechanic's guide for Hamid's SUV -
page on the odometer, dog-eared.

34:39.320 --> 34:41.150
He wasn't a Christian.

34:41.239 --> 34:44.391
- "Deceit in the service of Allah is holy. "
- The Koran?

34:44.480 --> 34:50.396
No. An imam's twisted interpretation of it
so mass murderers don't have to feeI guilt.

34:50.480 --> 34:54.359
He's made another bomb.
It's out there right now.

34:54.440 --> 34:56.158
I'm convinced.

34:56.239 --> 35:00.995
What's the dispersaI rate for a bomb
packed with, say, two litres of dioxin?

35:01.080 --> 35:06.677
Homemade device similar to the car bomb?
That could be three to 500 meters.

35:06.760 --> 35:10.992
If the victims weren't killed,
they'd develop cancer, blindness, lesions...

35:11.080 --> 35:15.232
Today's date is marked. Call
Homeland Security to secure the apartment.

35:15.320 --> 35:19.791
A convenience-store owner saw Farid
get on a bus and head downtown.

35:19.880 --> 35:23.668
We're not sure what bus. Booth is checking.
If you find anything...

35:23.760 --> 35:26.320
These bus schedules are totally confusing.

35:26.400 --> 35:30.871
His date book had "530" circled.
Check anything that has to do with "530".

35:30.960 --> 35:33.838
Begins, ends, whatever.
I'm not going anywhere.

35:33.920 --> 35:37.230
I still don't understand
why Farid would kill his brother.

35:37.320 --> 35:40.676
Both were developing symptoms.
People would ask questions.

35:40.760 --> 35:43.149
Farid would be exposed.
He had a mission.

35:43.240 --> 35:47.153
How does he think he'll bring about
a better world by blowing people up?

35:47.240 --> 35:52.439
- Fanaticism and logic don't go hand in hand.
- It's almost 5:30. Come on, Angela!

35:52.520 --> 35:53.873
<i>OK, OK.</i>

35:53.960 --> 35:55.757
Three movies start at six.

35:55.840 --> 36:00.038
There's a lecture at Fuller Hall on birds.
I can't imagine that'll be crowded.

36:00.120 --> 36:04.238
And... a peace conference
at the Hamilton CulturaI Centre.

36:04.320 --> 36:08.154
There'll be speeches by Arab moderates
and a congressman. That's the one.

36:08.240 --> 36:11.550
- Peace conference, Hamilton CulturaI Centre.
- That'll be it.

36:11.640 --> 36:16.236
Gibson, get your boys over to the Hamilton
CulturaI Centre, but keep them back.

36:16.320 --> 36:19.596
If we spook this guy, he'll blow himself up.

36:19.680 --> 36:21.432
- Thanks, Angela.
- Bye.

36:21.520 --> 36:24.751
- You don't have to come.
- You gotta be kidding me.

36:33.440 --> 36:37.149
<i>We'll start down here
and make our way upstairs.</i>

36:41.200 --> 36:44.397
<i>Welcome to the Hamilton
CulturaI Centre Peace Conference.</i>

36:44.480 --> 36:50.510
We would ask that all delegates check
in before the keynote speaker address.

36:50.600 --> 36:52.830
There are too many ways in.

36:52.920 --> 36:56.993
- Where are the reinforcements?
- They're downstairs tying up the horses.

36:57.080 --> 37:01.153
- Sarcasm doesn't help.
- Mobilising SWAT teams takes time.

37:01.240 --> 37:06.030
And if Farid has the bomb
and spots them, that could be bad.

37:06.120 --> 37:09.590
- If you see him, will you shoot?
- He might not have the bomb.

37:09.680 --> 37:12.114
I'm not taking out a target unless I'm sure.

37:12.200 --> 37:14.998
Is that how you make it easier?
Calling him a target?

37:15.080 --> 37:18.550
You really picked an odd time
to have this conversation.

37:25.240 --> 37:28.073
- Booth.
- Farid?

37:36.120 --> 37:40.318
- There! That's Farid!
- I'm not sure.

37:40.400 --> 37:44.473
His walk is laboured from the dioxin and
the bones in his skull match his picture.

37:44.560 --> 37:48.348
- What if you're wrong?
- It's what I do. Do you really want to wait?

37:49.320 --> 37:52.517
He's carrying something heavy.
It's making his shoulder...

37:52.600 --> 37:56.479
- No, I can't.
- He has all the markers, Booth.

37:57.040 --> 38:00.112
- I need a face. I need a face!
- Farid!

38:00.200 --> 38:03.192
- On the ground!
- He's going for the bomb!

38:47.800 --> 38:53.033
I told them to tell the press
that it was an undercover operation.

38:53.120 --> 38:56.317
But it would be a Rose Garden ceremony.

38:56.400 --> 38:59.551
That's an honour, right?

38:59.640 --> 39:03.076
I thought you FBI guys like your medals.

39:03.160 --> 39:06.835
No pleasure in taking someone's life.

39:10.160 --> 39:12.469
Nothing to celebrate.

39:12.560 --> 39:16.189
You saved so many people, Booth.

39:16.280 --> 39:19.352
Don't forget that.

39:24.720 --> 39:27.188
Want another drink?

39:29.400 --> 39:33.552
Shouldn't you be getting home?

39:34.320 --> 39:37.630
Tessa will be worried about you.

39:40.560 --> 39:42.551
Yeah.

39:45.320 --> 39:47.914
I guess I should.

39:58.400 --> 40:01.597
Thanks for your help, Bones.

40:01.680 --> 40:03.033
Sure.

42:01.920 --> 42:04.593
