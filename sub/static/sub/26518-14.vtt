WEBVTT

00:00.367 --> 00:01.567
<i>Tasha, where are you?</i>

00:01.635 --> 00:02.695
<i>I'm on my way to Zurich.</i>

00:02.732 --> 00:05.718
<i>I know where Madeline keeps
documents she won't destroy.</i>

00:05.993 --> 00:08.375
<i>It could be the key to finding her.</i>

00:08.412 --> 00:09.692
<i>Why are you going by yourself?</i>

00:09.729 --> 00:12.149
<i>Let me send backup.</i>

00:12.399 --> 00:14.367
<i>No, I've got to do this on my own.</i>

00:41.775 --> 00:44.063
- Is it done?
- I've secured the SD card.

00:44.131 --> 00:46.365
- Headed to the airport now.
- And Zapata?

00:46.433 --> 00:48.100
She's gonna wake up
with quite the headache,

00:48.168 --> 00:49.469
but she'll be fine.

00:49.536 --> 00:52.038
Good work. Madeline will be pleased.

00:57.444 --> 00:59.412
What were you thinking, going alone?

00:59.480 --> 01:01.147
Sending an FBI team to go to Zurich

01:01.215 --> 01:02.882
would have taken time
and drawn attention.

01:02.950 --> 01:05.150
- I had to act fast.
- You work for me now.

01:05.218 --> 01:06.819
This going rogue business
isn't gonna fly.

01:06.887 --> 01:08.354
This isn't the CIA.

01:08.422 --> 01:10.523
- Understood?
- Understood.

01:12.326 --> 01:14.727
Now, what'd you even get
besides that gash on your head?

01:14.795 --> 01:17.802
I got some information off an SD
card Madeline stashed in Zurich.

01:17.839 --> 01:19.396
I was able to upload some of the data

01:19.433 --> 01:21.400
before I was attacked
and had it stolen back.

01:22.070 --> 01:24.170
It'll give us the lead
we need to track her down.

01:24.238 --> 01:26.138
You'd better hope it does.

01:26.560 --> 01:30.122
Unfortunately, Tasha was only able
to upload a small amount of data.

01:30.159 --> 01:33.227
It was super fragmented and scrambled.

01:33.264 --> 01:35.198
So you nearly got yourself
killed for nothing?

01:35.482 --> 01:38.651
It's not nothing.
Patterson can unscramble it, right?

01:38.719 --> 01:40.887
Actually, Patterson and Rich
will be doing the unscrambling.

01:40.924 --> 01:43.811
I mean, since you've been deep cover,
we've become quite the dynamic duo.

01:43.878 --> 01:46.136
Thelma and Louise,
Han Solo and Chewbacca.

01:46.173 --> 01:48.107
Ooh, Kathie Lee and Hoda. Huh?

01:48.536 --> 01:51.397
We'll see what we can salvage,
but I can't make any promises.

01:51.465 --> 01:54.200
All right. So, where are we
with the search for Madeline.

01:54.268 --> 01:57.470
We raided her home and office.
No sign of her.

01:57.538 --> 01:59.539
Have you got any idea
where she could be, Tasha?

01:59.606 --> 02:01.607
I wish I knew. I want to put
the cuffs on her myself.

02:01.898 --> 02:04.403
We have an arrest warrant ready
for the Air Force One attack.

02:04.440 --> 02:07.075
Yeah, and for the murder
charges... Blake Crawford,

02:07.112 --> 02:09.447
the three HCI Global members,
Kira Evans.

02:09.616 --> 02:11.751
We'll find her.
We just gotta keep digging.

02:11.818 --> 02:13.619
All right, let's get back to it.

02:13.687 --> 02:15.928
- Hey, can we talk to you for a sec?
- Yeah.

02:15.992 --> 02:18.032
So we've been trying to
decode the puzzle

02:18.069 --> 02:19.859
Shepherd left you in her will.

02:19.927 --> 02:22.208
'Cause she couldn't just leave you
any money, like a regular person.

02:22.244 --> 02:23.897
It's just another one of her games.

02:23.993 --> 02:26.611
She wanted you to have
this after she died.

02:26.648 --> 02:28.683
Maybe this is the last game.

02:28.720 --> 02:30.705
We're thinking that
this could be the key

02:30.763 --> 02:32.564
to unlocking all of the tattoos.

02:32.608 --> 02:35.275
Or, it's her way of torturing
me from beyond the grave.

02:35.342 --> 02:37.343
Maybe we're just wasting
our time with this.

02:37.411 --> 02:38.809
I don't think it's a waste of time.

02:38.846 --> 02:40.934
It's a literal jigsaw puzzle.

02:40.971 --> 02:44.098
All we had to do was put the pieces
in their correct place to reveal...

02:44.246 --> 02:47.520
An image of a sculpture called
The Altar of Mars and Venus.

02:47.588 --> 02:51.991
In Roman mythology, Mars was the
divine father of Romulus and Remus.

02:52.183 --> 02:54.779
Roman and Remi,
the names my brother and I

02:54.816 --> 02:57.654
chose for ourselves
when Shepherd adopted us.

02:57.871 --> 03:00.139
There's got to be more to it than that.

03:02.081 --> 03:06.472
Hey, look. She used a needle to
poke dozens of holes in the wolf.

03:06.540 --> 03:09.120
That's got to be some
kind of code, right?

03:09.721 --> 03:12.256
Great find, Jane.
Patterson is really kicking herself

03:12.379 --> 03:13.943
she didn't see that first.

03:14.029 --> 03:16.182
- I was working mostly off of the scans.
- It's okay.

03:16.249 --> 03:17.817
You don't have to beat
yourself up. It's fine.

03:17.884 --> 03:19.505
You know what?
The sooner we solve this,

03:19.559 --> 03:22.695
the faster we can get you to closure.

03:25.659 --> 03:27.201
Hey...

03:27.796 --> 03:29.831
We need to talk about Tasha.

03:30.244 --> 03:32.932
She was just attacked by
one of Madeline's goons.

03:33.000 --> 03:35.067
The CIA, they still want her dead,

03:35.409 --> 03:38.471
- so she really needs us right now.
- I know that.

03:38.538 --> 03:40.471
You holding a grudge
against her doesn't help.

03:40.508 --> 03:43.042
Well, I can't just flip a switch
and go back to the way it was.

03:45.192 --> 03:47.880
I get that. All right.

03:47.948 --> 03:50.716
But she was doing a job for the CIA

03:51.155 --> 03:53.419
and now she's back with us,

03:53.945 --> 03:57.123
so she's either with us or she's not.

03:57.190 --> 03:59.345
I agree. Now, that's up to her.

03:59.382 --> 04:02.762
No. It goes both ways.
See, you gotta decide.

04:03.180 --> 04:05.739
Do you want her back on
this team again or not?

04:12.837 --> 04:14.267
Hey.

04:15.774 --> 04:17.877
- You okay?
- I'm fine.

04:18.345 --> 04:19.812
As someone who's lied about that a lot,

04:19.880 --> 04:22.072
I know when it's not true.

04:23.181 --> 04:24.917
I came in here to put
my stuff away out of habit,

04:24.985 --> 04:26.858
but I don't have a locker anymore.

04:31.319 --> 04:33.359
Maybe I just don't belong here now.

04:35.538 --> 04:38.931
It's, uh... It's a locker.

04:38.999 --> 04:40.633
You're still one of us.

04:40.983 --> 04:44.370
Maybe I'm not. I left.

04:44.835 --> 04:46.946
And I got really used to
working on my own.

04:46.983 --> 04:50.042
I'm not sure how to be a part of
this team again or if I should be.

04:50.577 --> 04:53.245
Well, I know what you're going through.

04:53.671 --> 04:56.173
I did a lot of awful
things when I was Remi

04:56.240 --> 04:58.569
and I'm still trying to figure
out how to live with that,

04:58.606 --> 05:02.242
but it helps to surround yourself
with people who care about you.

05:03.714 --> 05:06.516
I'm not sure how many
of those I have left.

05:08.100 --> 05:12.046
Everyone here still
supports you, even Reade.

05:12.229 --> 05:13.796
He's just hurt because
you matter to him.

05:13.833 --> 05:16.295
Just give it time.

05:18.303 --> 05:20.567
Multiple bombings in New York.

05:20.815 --> 05:23.316
Come on. We need you.

05:26.009 --> 05:28.038
Three bombs just went off
in Williamsburg:

05:28.106 --> 05:31.516
Two in brownstones, one in a
car, all in the last hour.

05:31.563 --> 05:33.977
Why does that sound familiar?

05:34.045 --> 05:36.876
Because two years ago, we solved a
case that started the exact same way.

05:36.913 --> 05:40.282
Three bombs in that same
neighborhood the same time of day.

05:40.298 --> 05:42.499
Yeah, but we caught that bomber.
She's in prison.

05:42.566 --> 05:45.368
- Must be a copycat.
- Uh, a person claiming

05:45.405 --> 05:47.165
responsibility for today's attacks

05:47.202 --> 05:49.833
just left a message
on the FBI tip line.

05:50.446 --> 05:52.573
<i>Two years ago, someone at the FBI</i>

05:52.610 --> 05:54.212
<i>framed the Williamsburg Bomber.</i>

05:54.249 --> 05:57.330
<i>Today is your reckoning.
Until the person responsible</i>

05:57.367 --> 05:59.049
<i>publicly confesses to this crime,</i>

05:59.116 --> 06:00.848
<i>I will continue detonating bombs</i>

06:00.885 --> 06:03.386
<i>and people will continue to die.</i>

06:17.234 --> 06:18.768
Three package bombs in Williamsburg,

06:18.805 --> 06:20.440
all detonated in the last 20 minutes.

06:20.487 --> 06:22.989
I've sent teams to each crime
scene to look for evidence,

06:23.049 --> 06:25.103
talk to eyewitnesses,
and deal with crowd control.

06:25.140 --> 06:27.501
There were six casualties during
the original bombings two years ago.

06:27.537 --> 06:28.893
Today, there's been 12.

06:28.924 --> 06:31.479
So this copycat serial
bomber is accusing us

06:31.516 --> 06:33.019
of putting an innocent woman in prison?

06:33.056 --> 06:35.606
Yeah, and threatening to set off
more bombs if we don't confess.

06:35.643 --> 06:36.934
There's nothing to confess to.

06:36.971 --> 06:38.961
We arrested Lilly Terrace
on solid physical evidence

06:39.029 --> 06:40.361
and she's been in prison ever since.

06:40.408 --> 06:41.957
That was one of Reade's first big cases

06:41.994 --> 06:44.379
as Assistant Director when
Hirst was head of the FBI.

06:44.416 --> 06:45.937
Yeah, while you were
running around the world

06:45.973 --> 06:47.186
trying to shake a bounty on your head

06:47.245 --> 06:48.734
and Kurt was still looking for you.

06:48.789 --> 06:51.558
And I was in Silicon Valley
working on Wizardville.

06:51.775 --> 06:54.281
So only you two
were working on this case?

06:54.367 --> 06:56.845
- And Stuart.
- Yeah, 'til Hirst killed him.

06:57.240 --> 06:58.774
Rest in peace, little guy.

06:58.811 --> 07:00.111
Also, Weller and I were here.

07:00.234 --> 07:02.061
Yeah, but you were still a convict

07:02.107 --> 07:03.507
and I was on leave from the FBI.

07:03.544 --> 07:06.345
Maybe we should revisit
the case from two years ago.

07:06.382 --> 07:08.950
It might help us identify the
identity of the current bomber.

07:09.040 --> 07:12.443
It was our first case after you
left, so Stuart took the reins.

07:15.089 --> 07:17.490
Two bombings in Williamsburg
in the last hour,

07:17.558 --> 07:19.715
one in a brownstone,
the other in a car.

07:19.752 --> 07:21.119
Both hidden inside packages.

07:21.200 --> 07:22.667
So we're looking at a serial bomber.

07:22.806 --> 07:24.974
Yeah, except so far,
nothing connects the victims.

07:25.049 --> 07:26.645
The first is a 38-year-old woman

07:26.682 --> 07:28.478
who lives in a $4 million brownstone.

07:28.515 --> 07:30.598
The second, an ex-con
who just got out of jail.

07:30.622 --> 07:33.170
- We have any leads?
- Honestly? None.

07:33.207 --> 07:37.389
So we have no idea who this guy is or
how many bombs are still out there.

07:37.426 --> 07:38.670
We need boots on the ground.

07:38.707 --> 07:40.388
I'll send agents to each
of the bombing locations,

07:40.424 --> 07:42.800
see if they can find eyewitnesses
or evidence NYPD missed.

07:42.868 --> 07:45.022
And I'll issue an alert
to all New York residents

07:45.059 --> 07:48.506
not to approach or touch
any suspicious looking packages.

07:48.900 --> 07:52.002
All right, you two head to the
lab and see what you can find.

07:56.482 --> 07:58.516
Hey, can I talk to you?

07:59.152 --> 08:01.113
We've really got to focus on
finding this bomber right now.

08:01.547 --> 08:03.828
Which is why you should
put me out in the field.

08:03.947 --> 08:06.984
Can we discuss this later when
Brooklyn stops blowing up?

08:07.475 --> 08:09.576
- Hey.
- Look who's back.

08:09.644 --> 08:12.479
- Hey, stranger.
- Hi. How you doing?

08:13.583 --> 08:16.055
- It's good to see you.
- Yeah. Good seeing you too.

08:16.092 --> 08:18.240
Well, if you need me,
I'll be in the lab,

08:18.342 --> 08:23.690
using my highly specialized
skill set helping Stuart.

08:24.412 --> 08:29.263
Uh... everything okay with you two?

08:29.357 --> 08:32.474
I know you didn't fly in from wherever
you just came from for small talk.

08:32.529 --> 08:36.013
- What's going on?
- Well, I got a new lead on Jane.

08:36.076 --> 08:38.672
There was a carjacking
in Moscow two days ago.

08:38.881 --> 08:41.942
An eyewitness saw this woman
with a neck tattoo.

08:42.517 --> 08:44.919
It says here the tattoo was of a bat.

08:44.956 --> 08:48.782
Bird or bat, I mean, you know, it's
pretty easy to confuse from a distance.

08:49.513 --> 08:51.407
You've been after Jane
for the past six months.

08:51.444 --> 08:53.107
How long you gonna do this
before you go bankrupt?

08:53.144 --> 08:54.771
I'm fine.

08:55.277 --> 08:57.984
I already took out a second mortgage.

08:58.373 --> 09:01.486
I had to. I've got to find her, Edgar.

09:02.427 --> 09:04.122
Whatever you need. How can I help?

09:04.190 --> 09:06.591
Well, she might still be in Russia,

09:06.779 --> 09:09.060
but visas take two weeks.

09:09.388 --> 09:11.963
Can you please expedite one for me?

09:12.031 --> 09:13.798
I'll call in some favors. That's fine.

09:19.232 --> 09:21.239
A third bomb was just
detonated in Williamsburg.

09:21.619 --> 09:23.320
The visa's still gonna take some time.

09:23.357 --> 09:25.243
You mind giving us an assist
on this one while you wait?

09:25.311 --> 09:26.797
You're gonna be stuck here anyway.

09:26.834 --> 09:28.115
As soon as I can fly, though...

09:28.152 --> 09:30.582
You'll be on a flight
straight to Moscow. I got you.

09:34.310 --> 09:37.386
I gotta ask. Was there a
Russian police report about you?

09:38.294 --> 09:42.360
I think so. I was
in Moscow at the time,

09:42.428 --> 09:44.829
and there was an incident with a car.

09:44.897 --> 09:46.399
That was you?

09:47.155 --> 09:49.788
- I was really close to finding you.
- Yeah, you were.

09:49.939 --> 09:51.273
Hold on.

09:51.310 --> 09:53.544
The copycat bomber
just left another message.

09:53.706 --> 09:55.874
<i>You can't hide in the shadows.</i>

09:55.942 --> 09:59.544
<i>Confess, or another bomb
is about to blow.</i>

09:59.612 --> 10:01.513
Overconfident criminals make mistakes.

10:01.579 --> 10:03.512
Yep,
and he just left another data point.

10:03.582 --> 10:06.184
- I'm gonna find this guy.
- How did you catch Lilly Terrace?

10:06.252 --> 10:07.605
I mean, maybe that'll give us a clue.

10:07.642 --> 10:09.162
That's actually where
I come into this story,

10:09.199 --> 10:10.979
with a big old alley-oop assist.

10:11.340 --> 10:13.658
Uhh!

10:13.910 --> 10:16.102
When I heard what was going on in
Brooklyn, I knew I had to help,

10:16.139 --> 10:19.669
so I called up my old friends
at the FBI with a hot tip.

10:21.918 --> 10:25.194
I'm here to help.
You don't have to look so menacing.

10:25.291 --> 10:27.592
I'm a delicate flower.

10:27.824 --> 10:31.516
If you have any information about
the bombings, start talking.

10:31.553 --> 10:34.388
I just might have found the
connection between all the victims.

10:34.868 --> 10:39.344
Two words, Swift Shop.
The food delivery service?

10:39.413 --> 10:42.115
- He's wasting our time.
- I can prove it.

10:42.338 --> 10:44.606
I just need a chance to show you.

10:45.196 --> 10:47.899
Wait a second. So Patterson's
in Silicon Valley?

10:47.936 --> 10:50.537
She'd rather be coding with nerds
than saving the world with you guys?

10:50.780 --> 10:53.115
Oh, and you got some intern
running the lab. That's a shame.

10:53.183 --> 10:56.585
I'm not an intern.
I have two master's degrees and a Ph.D.

10:56.653 --> 10:59.274
Hey, where's Jane?
Shouldn't she be leaning against a wall

10:59.311 --> 11:01.383
with that look that says she
definitely wants a piece of this?

11:01.420 --> 11:04.359
Rich, you said you could prove a
connection between the victims.

11:04.427 --> 11:06.228
- Prove it.
- Okay.

11:06.296 --> 11:08.664
I knew Scotty, the guy
who died in the car bombing.

11:08.731 --> 11:10.766
The ex-con. That is not surprising.

11:10.834 --> 11:12.835
We were in the same cell
block until a week ago.

11:12.902 --> 11:15.188
He used to brag all the time
that he would steal packages

11:15.225 --> 11:17.410
off people's doorsteps
before he got busted.

11:17.540 --> 11:19.460
It seems like a weird thing to
show off about, if you ask me.

11:19.496 --> 11:22.744
Wait. So, you think that Scotty stole
a package with a bomb in it today?

11:22.812 --> 11:25.013
Yes, and I can prove it if
you let me at this computer.

11:25.074 --> 11:26.735
- No.
- Okay. Well, then,

11:26.772 --> 11:28.479
let the praying mantis do it.

11:28.610 --> 11:31.954
- My name is Stuart.
- Yes, okay.

11:32.021 --> 11:34.857
Well, why don't you bring up something
called Williamsburg BurroughBuddy.

11:34.924 --> 11:38.318
It's an online message board for
gentrifiers to post complaints.

11:38.355 --> 11:40.590
This morning, "Monica"
posted that a guy

11:40.627 --> 11:42.261
stole a Swift Shop
package off her doorstep.

11:42.318 --> 11:45.115
He matches Scotty's description
and this fits the timeline.

11:45.152 --> 11:47.153
She said Scotty stole
the package at 7 a.m.

11:47.190 --> 11:48.957
The bomb went off at 7:30.

11:49.396 --> 11:51.166
So Scotty wasn't the intended victim.

11:51.203 --> 11:53.181
How do you know that Swift
Shop connects the three vics?

11:53.271 --> 11:55.939
Well, woman-whose-name
I-don't-quite-remember,

11:55.976 --> 11:58.511
- a quick online search proved that...
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

11:58.548 --> 12:01.500
I thought you were forbidden
from using any devices in prison.

12:01.751 --> 12:03.830
Okay. Well,
do I have immunity for any crimes

12:03.867 --> 12:06.080
I may or may not have committed
in the name of truth and justice?

12:06.142 --> 12:08.112
- Absolutely not.
- Okay. Well, then,

12:08.149 --> 12:10.220
a friend named "Mitch DotOrg"

12:10.257 --> 12:11.758
did some very harmless
white hat hacking

12:11.795 --> 12:13.495
from a computer in the prison library

12:13.532 --> 12:15.981
and he figured out that
all three intended victims

12:16.018 --> 12:17.387
recently signed up for Swift Shop.

12:17.424 --> 12:20.836
Okay, but why would the bomber
target Swift Shop subscribers?

12:20.904 --> 12:24.481
Well, I kind of thought you people with
the badges would figure that one out.

12:24.518 --> 12:27.094
Nice work, Rich. We'll put some
credits on your prison account.

12:27.235 --> 12:31.438
Oh. Or, maybe since I brought you
your one and only lead so far,

12:31.506 --> 12:35.069
you could let me stick around and
help solve the rest of the case.

12:38.155 --> 12:39.688
Fine. As long as you stay useful.

12:39.725 --> 12:41.960
Absolutely. Let me at this touchscreen.

12:42.065 --> 12:44.333
No! I'll do the typing.

12:44.370 --> 12:46.104
Weller, since Monica
was the intended victim,

12:46.143 --> 12:47.785
why don't you take
a team over to her place

12:47.822 --> 12:49.229
- and gather some evidence?
- All right.

12:49.266 --> 12:51.135
Zapata, keep an eye on Rich.

12:51.210 --> 12:53.176
Don't let him out of your sight.

12:54.118 --> 12:56.219
Wait a second, I got it. It's Briana.

12:56.403 --> 12:58.738
Is that right? Is your name Briana?

13:01.814 --> 13:04.494
Hey, good news. CSU found parts of
a camera at the first crime scene.

13:04.561 --> 13:06.871
They're about to
send it over right now.

13:06.908 --> 13:08.998
- Why aren't you with Rich?
- Stuart is with him.

13:09.035 --> 13:10.502
He does not need two babysitters.

13:10.908 --> 13:12.668
Rich is a criminal
mastermind and a con man.

13:12.705 --> 13:14.056
Stuart isn't equipped to handle him.

13:14.103 --> 13:16.806
You gotta have more faith
in your team, including me.

13:16.874 --> 13:18.508
What does that mean?

13:18.575 --> 13:20.269
Since you became Assistant Director,

13:20.306 --> 13:22.078
you've had me chained to this office.

13:22.322 --> 13:24.413
I'm a field agent, not a lab tech.

13:24.877 --> 13:27.308
We're shorthanded.
It's where I need you.

13:27.345 --> 13:30.712
- This isn't punishment.
- The CIA offered me a spot at Langley.

13:31.656 --> 13:33.257
Are you seriously dropping
this on me right now?

13:33.293 --> 13:34.894
You couldn't wait 'til
we caught this guy?

13:35.233 --> 13:37.100
There's never gonna be a good time.

13:43.635 --> 13:47.572
Stuart's got something.
To be continued.

13:49.618 --> 13:52.095
All right. So, what's
the update, Stuart?

13:52.132 --> 13:54.233
Who's the hot plate of sweet potatoes?

13:54.665 --> 13:57.180
FBI Director Eleanor Hirst.

13:57.736 --> 14:00.816
I'll thank you not to speak
to me that way ever again.

14:00.884 --> 14:02.845
- And you are?
- Full of regret.

14:02.882 --> 14:06.798
This is Rich DotCom. He's bad with
people but good with computers.

14:07.361 --> 14:08.958
Stuart, you were saying?

14:09.373 --> 14:13.024
- So, I dug into Swift Shop...
- We dug into Swift Shop.

14:13.220 --> 14:16.736
And we found a ton of bad reviews
for their grocery delivery service.

14:16.773 --> 14:18.774
They know what Swift Shop is.
Just get to the good stuff.

14:19.337 --> 14:22.438
Turns out one person created hundreds
of fake profiles to write them.

14:22.506 --> 14:24.980
I noticed some similarities
in the language

14:25.017 --> 14:26.509
and punctuation
of a bunch of the posts.

14:26.577 --> 14:28.344
This young lady really
loves her double dashes.

14:28.412 --> 14:31.220
We were able to trace all the
profiles back to one IP address.

14:31.289 --> 14:33.681
She didn't even use a VPN or
bounce through a proxy server.

14:33.718 --> 14:34.791
It was total amateur hour.

14:34.828 --> 14:36.669
Does this person have a name
or are we supposed to guess?

14:36.705 --> 14:38.521
- Lilly Terrace.
- Lilly Terrace.

14:38.589 --> 14:40.256
Lilly tried to join the Army last year

14:40.293 --> 14:41.726
but didn't pass her psych eval.

14:41.763 --> 14:44.298
So she escalated from
writing fake reviews

14:44.428 --> 14:46.696
to bombing Swift Shop subscribers?

14:46.763 --> 14:49.198
I think I know that name, Terrace.

14:49.266 --> 14:51.067
Does Lilly's family own
a grocery store?

14:51.722 --> 14:54.116
Yes. It's called Sambria Market.

14:54.153 --> 14:57.288
Opened in 1920 by
Lilly's great-grandfather.

14:57.325 --> 14:58.990
Check out Mr. Recall over here, huh?

14:59.027 --> 15:00.943
I used to shop at that store
when I lived in Williamsburg.

15:00.980 --> 15:03.222
Looks like Sambria Market
closed a few months ago.

15:03.308 --> 15:06.716
Stuart, check to see if any of the
intended victims actually shopped there.

15:06.999 --> 15:10.152
According to credit
card statements, they all did,

15:10.220 --> 15:11.887
until they signed up for Swift Shop.

15:12.445 --> 15:14.257
Oh! Can you say "motive"?

15:14.324 --> 15:16.525
Let's get Lilly Terrace in
for a little chat.

15:16.918 --> 15:19.462
Do you really think that Lilly
bombed Brooklyn, then came here?

15:20.137 --> 15:22.812
Her mom is dying of
terminal pancreatic cancer.

15:22.981 --> 15:24.186
Nothing like accusing

15:24.223 --> 15:26.165
someone of murder in front
of their dying mom.

15:27.635 --> 15:30.711
I'm sorry. My wife isn't
accepting any visitors today.

15:30.871 --> 15:33.209
Yeah. No, sir, we're with the FBI.

15:33.277 --> 15:35.244
We need to talk to your daughter Lilly.

15:35.742 --> 15:37.888
Lilly? What's this about?

15:37.947 --> 15:39.248
No idea.

15:39.449 --> 15:42.118
Tasha, there's been another bombing.

15:42.333 --> 15:44.145
Killed a family of three.

15:45.732 --> 15:48.967
- Where are the other bombs?
- I want a lawyer.

15:49.398 --> 15:52.742
Wait. Where did the fourth
bomb go off two years ago?

15:52.779 --> 15:54.374
617 North Berry.

15:54.418 --> 15:56.506
Wait, two years ago,
the first bomb went off

15:56.543 --> 15:58.169
at 713 South Bedford.

15:58.255 --> 16:01.304
Today, the first one
went off at 317 South Bedford.

16:01.371 --> 16:04.490
The copycat bomber is reversing
the order of the numbers.

16:04.927 --> 16:07.906
Which means the next bomb
is at 716 North Berry Street.

16:07.943 --> 16:09.312
I'll evacuate the entire block.

16:09.379 --> 16:11.738
All right. I'll call
the bomb squad. Let's move.

16:13.335 --> 16:16.745
We're too late.
The fourth bomb just went off.

16:21.715 --> 16:23.310
Luckily,
there was no one in the brownstone

16:23.347 --> 16:25.511
when the bomb went off,
so there weren't any casualties.

16:25.558 --> 16:27.144
Can we get ahead of the next target?

16:27.181 --> 16:29.170
Do we have another address
from the previous case?

16:29.207 --> 16:32.948
No. Lilly planted a total of four
bombs before we arrested her.

16:33.339 --> 16:36.128
So we have no idea
where or when the copycat bomber

16:36.165 --> 16:37.988
will detonate
his next explosive device.

16:38.025 --> 16:39.449
Sorry I'm late. Traffic is crazy.

16:39.486 --> 16:41.486
It's like the end of the world
out there. Someone catch me up.

16:41.522 --> 16:43.199
We're being blackmailed
by a serial bomber.

16:43.254 --> 16:45.656
He wants us to confess
to framing Lilly Terrace.

16:45.724 --> 16:48.536
Framed her? No one framed her.
It was an airtight case.

16:48.573 --> 16:50.428
I should know. I was the one
who put her behind bars.

16:50.495 --> 16:52.730
How did you end up
with an "airtight case"?

16:53.049 --> 16:55.299
So far, it sounds
pretty circumstantial.

16:55.367 --> 16:57.301
Yeah, you're right.
At the time, the only evidence we had

16:57.369 --> 16:59.344
was Rich's crazy Swift Shop theory.

16:59.381 --> 17:01.149
Excuse me, it wasn't crazy.
It was correct.

17:01.440 --> 17:04.476
Uh, correct or not, it wouldn't
have held up in court.

17:04.512 --> 17:05.854
So we needed a confession.

17:05.891 --> 17:07.144
But she asked for a lawyer.

17:07.647 --> 17:10.405
I might have gotten a little
creative in interrogation.

17:11.233 --> 17:13.223
Your lawyer's on her way.

17:13.724 --> 17:16.828
While we wait, let's have a chat.

17:17.281 --> 17:19.924
Talk all you want. I'm not gonna
answer any of your questions.

17:20.406 --> 17:25.061
We've been trying to figure out
why a nice person such as yourself

17:25.539 --> 17:27.397
would suddenly decide
to kill six people today.

17:28.000 --> 17:30.408
Didn't seem right,
so we did some research.

17:30.445 --> 17:32.447
Your mom was diagnosed
with pancreatic cancer,

17:32.484 --> 17:34.872
which left you in charge of
the family grocery store.

17:35.047 --> 17:38.797
When Swift Shop started
taking all of your customers,

17:38.930 --> 17:40.244
you tried to get them back.

17:40.312 --> 17:43.414
You even offered your own
grocery delivery service,

17:43.820 --> 17:45.983
but you couldn't compete
with Swift Shop, could you?

17:46.453 --> 17:48.071
It's pretty rough lately.

17:48.108 --> 17:49.705
The community you grew up in,

17:49.750 --> 17:54.258
the one your family gave
so much to, abandoned you,

17:54.586 --> 17:58.162
so you decided to teach them
a lesson, didn't you?

17:59.292 --> 18:02.634
Can't say that I blame you. I probably
would've done the same thing myself.

18:02.671 --> 18:05.262
Your mom is dying, Lilly.
Do you really want to spend

18:05.299 --> 18:07.854
the rest of her life waiting for trial?

18:08.002 --> 18:10.908
'Cause you're gonna go
from here to jail to prison.

18:10.976 --> 18:12.309
You're not gonna see her again.

18:12.377 --> 18:14.879
No more visits,
no goodbye after she passes.

18:14.946 --> 18:16.847
You won't even be at her funeral.

18:16.915 --> 18:20.215
As far as you're concerned,
she might as well be dead already.

18:20.863 --> 18:23.995
Or you can give us a signed
confession and we'll make sure

18:24.063 --> 18:26.271
that you are with your mom
when the time comes.

18:27.614 --> 18:29.449
You can do that?

18:29.547 --> 18:33.350
That depends on you and what
you put on that piece of paper.

18:33.449 --> 18:35.754
How much does your mom mean to you?

18:36.105 --> 18:38.386
- <i>She means everything to me.</i>
- This is borderline coercion.

18:38.422 --> 18:41.178
If Lilly confesses,
it could be inadmissible.

18:41.215 --> 18:43.116
Zapata wonders why I
keep her in the lab.

18:43.441 --> 18:45.138
Maybe she should take
that job at the CIA.

18:45.175 --> 18:46.302
I'll help you, Lilly,

18:46.339 --> 18:47.981
<i>but you've got to give me something.</i>

18:49.014 --> 18:51.734
Well, they'd appreciate
her interrogation tactics.

18:53.303 --> 18:55.886
I know you love your mom,
Lilly, but I also know

18:55.954 --> 18:58.923
that if you don't see or speak
to her again to say goodbye

18:58.990 --> 19:03.000
you will regret it
for the rest of your life.

19:04.953 --> 19:08.901
Lilly's attorney's here.
Zapata, we're done.

19:12.437 --> 19:14.772
This is the camera the CSU team found.

19:14.831 --> 19:16.865
Over a dozen burnt pieces of it.

19:17.155 --> 19:19.532
- Well, that's a Door Informer.
- A what?

19:19.569 --> 19:21.788
It's a doorbell camera, they're new.
They're gonna be huge.

19:21.825 --> 19:23.048
- Do you mind I touch it?
- No!

19:23.085 --> 19:25.416
You just watch me silently.

19:25.483 --> 19:27.899
Mm, these lips were made for
talking and these hands were made

19:27.936 --> 19:29.647
for doing things that are
probably inappropriate

19:29.684 --> 19:30.866
to talk about during work hours.

19:30.903 --> 19:32.210
I don't know. I'm new here. Can I?

19:32.247 --> 19:36.994
Mr. DotCom, come with me please.

19:38.635 --> 19:41.270
You're sending me back
to prison, aren't you?

19:41.666 --> 19:45.950
We appreciate all you've done,
but I need my agents to focus,

19:45.987 --> 19:48.582
and they can't do that while
they're babysitting a child.

19:48.650 --> 19:51.326
Okay, look,
I know that I'm a lot, okay,

19:51.363 --> 19:52.956
but I'm not a child. I'm here to help.

19:52.993 --> 19:54.489
Stuart just brought in
a doorbell camera

19:54.526 --> 19:56.527
and he has zero idea
how to reassemble it.

19:57.200 --> 19:59.465
- And you do?
- I practically invented it.

19:59.872 --> 20:02.419
By which I mean I wrote it
down drunkenly on a napkin

20:02.456 --> 20:04.623
and my dealer stole it and
pitched it on "Shark Tank."

20:04.660 --> 20:06.227
The point is, I have
expertise to offer here.

20:06.264 --> 20:08.988
Fine. Help Stuart with the camera

20:09.025 --> 20:11.399
and then it's back to prison.

20:12.797 --> 20:14.957
Well, what if I could find the
evidence to convict Lilly Terrace?

20:14.993 --> 20:17.850
Would that be worth,
um, oh, I don't know,

20:17.887 --> 20:21.256
a full-time FBI consulting-type gig?

20:21.293 --> 20:25.262
In the unlikely circumstance
that you solve this case,

20:25.345 --> 20:30.332
I'll consider giving you a
probationary consulting position.

20:30.697 --> 20:33.899
- Don't get your hopes up.
- It's too late.

20:36.284 --> 20:38.034
Matthew Weitz is coming down.

20:38.097 --> 20:40.732
Of course he's the US Attorney we get.

20:40.769 --> 20:42.903
We can't catch a break on this one.

20:42.940 --> 20:46.370
How much you want to bet he makes
it all about his congressional race?

20:46.668 --> 20:49.604
There they are, two of
my favorite people right now.

20:49.641 --> 20:51.676
- I could hug you both!
- Ah, we're fine.

20:51.713 --> 20:53.203
Your timing was impeccable.

20:53.240 --> 20:54.858
You took down the Williamsburg Bomber

20:54.895 --> 20:56.996
just as I was about to
give my campaign speech.

20:57.096 --> 20:59.530
I talked about our
heroic efforts as a team,

20:59.613 --> 21:01.347
keeping the streets of Brooklyn safe.

21:01.713 --> 21:03.390
Oh, it's a win-win for everybody.

21:03.427 --> 21:05.993
May I suggest you get your
head out of the campaign

21:06.030 --> 21:07.493
and into attorney mode?

21:07.630 --> 21:10.465
'Cause this case isn't as
closed as you made it out to be.

21:10.744 --> 21:12.945
What? I thought you arrested somebody.

21:13.062 --> 21:14.824
We did, but we didn't have
any physical evidence

21:14.860 --> 21:16.447
tying them to the crime scenes.

21:16.484 --> 21:19.359
We had one eyewitness
who said she saw someone

21:19.396 --> 21:20.969
wearing a black baseball cap

21:21.006 --> 21:22.992
delivering a box to one of our victims,

21:23.029 --> 21:25.257
but she couldn't pick
Lilly out of a line-up.

21:25.294 --> 21:27.529
And Lilly lawyered up,
busting our interrogation

21:27.566 --> 21:29.046
and she didn't say
anything incriminating.

21:29.083 --> 21:31.161
This is terrible news for me...

21:31.674 --> 21:35.695
and for the people of New York
and the safety of the...

21:35.732 --> 21:38.467
peop... whatever, but also for me!

21:38.883 --> 21:42.788
I just told a crowd of people that this
case was sewn up. There was media there!

21:42.825 --> 21:45.359
But we still have time to gather
evidence tying her to the bombings.

21:45.421 --> 21:46.648
Well, maybe you should've done that

21:46.685 --> 21:48.519
before you arrested her!

21:51.431 --> 21:53.631
If we don't find something definitive
in the next couple of hours,

21:53.668 --> 21:54.906
we're gonna have to let Lilly go.

21:54.943 --> 21:56.570
I can't believe we spent an all-nighter

21:56.607 --> 21:57.873
going through traffic cam footage

21:57.910 --> 21:59.991
and we got nothing.
If Stretch Armstrong

22:00.028 --> 22:01.748
over here would just let me
look at the doorbell cam,

22:01.784 --> 22:03.404
- I could've solved this hours ago.
- Stuart!

22:03.674 --> 22:06.082
Will you just let him
look at the camera already?

22:08.849 --> 22:10.433
Mom said I could, so...

22:10.470 --> 22:12.238
Let me show you how it's done, Stilts.

22:12.275 --> 22:14.365
Stuart. My name is Stuart.

22:14.451 --> 22:16.217
We need to talk about
Lilly's interrogation.

22:16.561 --> 22:19.654
Oh, you mean how she was about
to confess before you stopped it?

22:19.735 --> 22:22.270
You want to know why I haven't been
sending you out into the field lately?

22:22.451 --> 22:24.858
You've been acting recklessly
more and more all the time.

22:24.895 --> 22:26.696
Maybe the CIA is a better fit for you.

22:26.774 --> 22:28.256
- Are you firing me?
- No.

22:28.293 --> 22:30.466
If you want to leave,
that's your decision to make.

22:31.520 --> 22:33.708
Do I have a reason to stay?

22:40.065 --> 22:42.877
You'll have my resignation
by the end of this case.

22:43.855 --> 22:47.368
Holy motherboard, I found it!
Huh? See that?

22:47.485 --> 22:50.143
There's over two hours of footage
on this data card over here

22:50.180 --> 22:52.815
which I found from the wreckage
that Stuart could not.

22:53.024 --> 22:54.768
The timestamp puts her there at 5 a.m.,

22:54.805 --> 22:56.360
an hour before the bomb went off.

22:56.428 --> 22:58.762
I'll be damned, Rich.
You actually did it.

22:58.821 --> 23:00.195
You found the smoking gun.

23:00.240 --> 23:02.675
Well, I can't take all the
credit for it. Yes, I can.

23:04.169 --> 23:05.892
Once Lilly saw the footage,
she took a plea deal.

23:05.969 --> 23:08.547
Okay, let me pull it up.

23:09.512 --> 23:12.340
50 years, no parole.
Like I said, airtight case.

23:12.377 --> 23:14.188
In the last message
the copycat bomber left us,

23:14.225 --> 23:15.852
he said we can't "hide in the shadows."

23:15.889 --> 23:18.257
Why would he think
we falsified evidence?

23:18.413 --> 23:20.881
Did we have anything
other than this video?

23:20.918 --> 23:22.752
We didn't need anything else.
She pled guilty.

23:22.789 --> 23:26.334
Rich, you said you found this
footage on the camera's memory card?

23:26.371 --> 23:29.239
Yes, I did, all by myself.
Totally legit.

23:29.308 --> 23:31.209
No, it isn't.

23:31.362 --> 23:33.483
The copycat bomber was right.

23:33.599 --> 23:35.373
This footage was doctored.

23:37.656 --> 23:39.890
Someone here on this team framed Lilly.

23:46.050 --> 23:48.161
Rich, did you alter evidence
to get a conviction?

23:48.198 --> 23:50.183
What? No! How could I?

23:50.251 --> 23:51.700
What's-her-name and Stuart

23:51.737 --> 23:53.400
never let me near a computer by myself.

23:53.437 --> 23:54.581
Also, why would I?

23:54.618 --> 23:56.698
That footage was literally
your get-out-of-jail-free card.

23:56.734 --> 23:58.895
Hirst gave you a job because
you found that video.

23:58.940 --> 24:01.561
Come on. You're not seriously
considering sending me back to prison?

24:01.598 --> 24:03.918
If you falsified evidence,
that's exactly where you're going, Rich.

24:03.954 --> 24:06.052
Okay, okay, okay. Patterson, just...

24:06.097 --> 24:08.192
just how do you know it was doctored?

24:08.301 --> 24:11.903
My software analyzed the footage
for artifacts of manipulation

24:11.958 --> 24:15.155
and it found that this video was
changed from color to black and white.

24:15.222 --> 24:16.958
This is what it originally looked like.

24:17.004 --> 24:18.708
Wait. She's wearing a blue cap,

24:18.754 --> 24:20.879
but the eyewitness said she
was wearing a black one,

24:20.942 --> 24:24.778
so someone doctored this video
to match the description.

24:24.864 --> 24:27.809
Wait a second. This camera only
shoots in black and white at night.

24:27.846 --> 24:29.481
Someone would've had to get into it

24:29.518 --> 24:31.825
and change the timestamp
to before sunrise.

24:31.862 --> 24:33.100
You see? I'm helping.

24:33.137 --> 24:35.241
The copycat bomber was
pointing us to the answer.

24:35.497 --> 24:38.389
At 5 a.m., these shadows
wouldn't be here.

24:38.426 --> 24:42.411
In reality, this was taken at 2:05 p.m.
on an entirely different day.

24:42.448 --> 24:43.614
Lilly did say

24:43.651 --> 24:45.891
that she delivered groceries
to her loyal customers.

24:45.958 --> 24:47.398
That must be what
she's doing on that video.

24:47.434 --> 24:49.320
We all thought it
was real... even Lilly.

24:49.398 --> 24:50.962
She confessed right after she saw it.

24:50.999 --> 24:53.519
If this wasn't recorded on the day of
the bombing, then where'd it come from?

24:53.555 --> 24:55.795
I ran a search on the doorbell
camera's cloud account.

24:55.917 --> 24:57.277
Nothing came up.

24:57.348 --> 24:59.488
Stuart was looking through
cloud footage.

24:59.684 --> 25:01.865
He could've deleted the
original to cover his tracks.

25:02.098 --> 25:03.506
You think Stuart did this?

25:03.598 --> 25:05.567
Rich was never with
a computer by himself

25:05.652 --> 25:07.307
and I know I didn't do it.
Who else could it be?

25:07.375 --> 25:10.176
Whoa, hang on. We can't pin this
on Stuart without any evidence.

25:10.244 --> 25:11.337
What was his motive?

25:11.374 --> 25:13.163
I got something. Okay...

25:13.200 --> 25:15.213
There was an intrusion
in the Door Informer servers

25:15.250 --> 25:16.883
the day you guys solved the case,

25:16.951 --> 25:19.750
and it looks like Stuart
hacked into their system

25:19.797 --> 25:22.057
- to erase the back-up video.
- How do you know it was Stuart?

25:22.102 --> 25:25.953
Because I can recognize his sloppy,
inelegant style of coding. It's...

25:26.008 --> 25:28.061
I'm sorry, I know you
shouldn't speak ill of the dead

25:28.129 --> 25:29.562
but Stuart was not a cyber criminal.

25:29.716 --> 25:31.152
He didn't know how to cover his tracks.

25:31.189 --> 25:32.766
He left a lot of
digital evidence behind.

25:32.833 --> 25:35.042
Oh, yeah, I would not be caught dead

25:35.079 --> 25:37.142
coding like that. I'm sorry, Stuart.

25:37.232 --> 25:39.486
Until now,
no one knew to look for this,

25:39.523 --> 25:40.904
so no one found it.

25:43.056 --> 25:44.658
Hey, if we don't respond

25:44.695 --> 25:46.876
to this blackmailer soon,
another bomb will go off.

25:46.943 --> 25:48.267
I say we tell the truth.

25:48.304 --> 25:50.083
Let's just... let's play this out.

25:50.634 --> 25:52.642
We admit to falsifying evidence,

25:52.782 --> 25:55.462
the bombings could still
continue, Lilly Terrace goes free,

25:55.499 --> 25:58.202
and we know that she's
guilty because she confessed!

25:58.303 --> 26:01.017
She accepted that plea deal after
you showed her doctored evidence.

26:01.054 --> 26:03.255
Exactly my point.
If she was innocent, she'd be screaming

26:03.323 --> 26:05.891
from the rooftops that that
video was fake, but she didn't.

26:05.959 --> 26:08.382
She took one look at it
and then she confessed.

26:08.419 --> 26:10.514
- No.
- Okay, okay.

26:11.040 --> 26:12.698
Let's say we reveal the truth,

26:12.766 --> 26:14.683
that this all happened
under your watch.

26:14.720 --> 26:17.884
Every case that you've
solved as Assistant Director

26:17.921 --> 26:22.908
would be called into question and I'd
have to fire you for real this time.

26:23.775 --> 26:25.578
So be it.

26:25.645 --> 26:27.780
We have to do what's right.

26:30.158 --> 26:31.759
Okay, let me tell you something now.

26:31.939 --> 26:35.396
This little pebble of
"right" that you want to drop

26:35.464 --> 26:38.566
has a very wide,
very bad ripple effect.

26:38.633 --> 26:42.069
Every criminal that you have
worked so hard to put in prison,

26:42.137 --> 26:44.505
where they belong, gets set free.

26:44.573 --> 26:46.704
Your task force will be disbanded,

26:46.741 --> 26:49.710
the FBI's reputation forever tarnished.

26:50.011 --> 26:54.587
These are not prices I'm willing
to pay for your one right thing.

26:58.453 --> 27:01.756
It's your call, but for
the record, you're wrong.

27:02.260 --> 27:07.731
Noted. Now let's go stop a copycat
bomber and save some lives, yeah?

27:09.765 --> 27:13.033
These acts of terror are being
fueled by deep anger and resentment,

27:13.437 --> 27:17.204
someone who lost as much as Lilly did
when the grocery store went under.

27:17.272 --> 27:19.039
So your gut is saying it's the dad?

27:19.202 --> 27:21.142
The Remi part of me understands him.

27:21.209 --> 27:22.880
He's motivated by revenge.

27:22.917 --> 27:24.485
Everything he loves was taken.

27:24.679 --> 27:27.261
His daughter went to prison,
his wife passed away,

27:27.426 --> 27:30.757
and if he could get Lilly exonerated,
he could have part of his old life back.

27:31.245 --> 27:32.964
He's been struggling financially.

27:33.001 --> 27:34.722
He's been working three jobs.

27:34.790 --> 27:37.124
Yeah, and one of them is
high school chemistry teacher.

27:37.192 --> 27:39.560
Anyone else getting a Walter
White vibe from this guy?

27:39.628 --> 27:41.529
It would explain
the type of bomb he made.

27:41.839 --> 27:44.341
Lilly's were made of
rudimentary explosive material,

27:44.378 --> 27:47.018
but the ones that went off
today tested positive for TATP.

27:47.145 --> 27:50.180
Forensics found traces of
pool sanitizer in the TATP.

27:50.405 --> 27:52.307
The school he teaches at has a pool.

27:52.348 --> 27:56.384
Okay. So, let's find Albert Terrace
and bring him in for questioning.

27:56.476 --> 27:58.077
The bombs were delivered by mail,

27:58.120 --> 28:00.767
so maybe there's post office
surveillance or receipts

28:00.804 --> 28:02.862
that'll tie him to one of the packages.

28:06.236 --> 28:08.643
- Any luck over there?
- Nope.

28:08.861 --> 28:12.223
Albert Terrace's name isn't showing up
on any of these post office receipts.

28:15.413 --> 28:17.979
If he mailed the bombs
from here, he paid cash.

28:25.846 --> 28:27.942
Things changed two
years ago when you quit.

28:28.143 --> 28:29.376
Let's be real.

28:29.729 --> 28:30.911
Things changed well before that.

28:30.948 --> 28:32.949
We just didn't talk about it.

28:33.212 --> 28:35.246
That sounds about right.

28:37.202 --> 28:40.557
If I had asked you to stay at the FBI,
would that have made a difference?

28:41.823 --> 28:43.916
I think in the moment, it would've.

28:44.611 --> 28:47.126
But I still would've ended
up at the CIA in the end.

28:48.283 --> 28:50.297
And now I can't even
go back to the CIA.

28:50.540 --> 28:55.025
Whether I stay here...
I guess that's up to you.

28:58.002 --> 29:00.145
Go for Weitz.

29:00.182 --> 29:01.543
<i>I knew it was you.</i>

29:01.579 --> 29:03.840
<i>You doctored the video footage
of Lilly Terrace,</i>

29:03.877 --> 29:06.301
<i>and one way or another,
the world's going to find out.</i>

29:06.338 --> 29:07.581
Who is this?

29:07.618 --> 29:10.524
<i>Confess in the next hour
or another bomb goes off,</i>

29:10.561 --> 29:13.517
<i>and this time, hundreds of
people in New York will die.</i>

29:16.963 --> 29:18.461
We're running out of time.

29:18.497 --> 29:20.177
We still don't have a solid
lead on Albert Terrace.

29:20.685 --> 29:23.978
And we need to come clean
about what Stuart did.

29:24.075 --> 29:25.942
Weitz isn't wrong, though.
Even if we tell the truth,

29:25.979 --> 29:27.486
what's to stop him from bombing anyway?

29:27.509 --> 29:29.894
No, you're right.
Once we blame it on a dead FBI agent,

29:29.931 --> 29:31.680
he's just gonna think it's a cop out.

29:32.993 --> 29:34.893
I found this footage on the cloud.

29:35.214 --> 29:37.185
It was recorded on the
doorbell cam three months ago.

29:37.456 --> 29:38.948
That's evidence Lilly knew the victim.

29:39.046 --> 29:41.286
- That's something, right?
- Eh, it's not enough.

29:41.323 --> 29:44.436
I need something that places Lilly
at the scene of the crime today.

29:45.360 --> 29:48.896
You know what, let's just...
Change the timestamp.

29:49.175 --> 29:52.871
You're joking, right?

29:54.495 --> 29:57.029
Look, we show Lilly this footage,

29:57.066 --> 29:58.263
we change the timestamp,

29:58.300 --> 30:01.081
and if she confesses
then we know that she did it.

30:01.227 --> 30:03.346
I can't falsify evidence.
I can go to prison.

30:03.383 --> 30:05.788
Stop, stop, stop.
Listen, I work for the Attorney General.

30:05.825 --> 30:07.054
That is not going to happen.

30:07.091 --> 30:09.705
We are hours away from Lilly
walking out of here a free woman.

30:09.742 --> 30:13.244
Everyone's gonna want to blame somebody
when she starts attacking again.

30:13.281 --> 30:15.416
Do you want that person to be you?

30:15.705 --> 30:19.128
You know that she did it.
Everybody knows that she did it.

30:19.807 --> 30:22.275
Sometimes, to be the good guy,

30:22.312 --> 30:24.947
you gotta bend the rules a little bit.

30:28.879 --> 30:30.405
It's all right.

30:35.381 --> 30:36.882
There's something I have to tell you.

30:36.950 --> 30:38.359
We just found Albert Terrace.

30:39.047 --> 30:42.289
Remember the second phone call
he made to the FBI tip line?

30:42.326 --> 30:43.927
He used a phone at a rest stop.

30:44.086 --> 30:45.754
A camera caught his license plate.

30:45.884 --> 30:48.055
We used LoJack to track his vehicle

30:48.092 --> 30:49.559
to an abandoned farm
in upstate New York.

30:49.700 --> 30:51.630
Also,
there's 50 pounds of pool sanitizer

30:51.698 --> 30:53.338
missing from the school
where Albert teaches at.

30:53.374 --> 30:56.768
A bomb with that much TATP could
level an entire city block.

30:56.903 --> 30:59.715
We think he went to the farm to
make his next explosive device.

30:59.752 --> 31:01.350
And then he'll
drive it back into Manhattan

31:01.386 --> 31:02.472
to maximize the casualties.

31:02.509 --> 31:03.790
We need to call local law enforcement.

31:03.826 --> 31:06.144
Already did. The police
arrived a few minutes ago

31:06.212 --> 31:08.914
but Terrace set off a bomb and
killed an officer when they arrived.

31:09.424 --> 31:12.026
They think the whole yard is wired.
They're in a standoff.

31:12.094 --> 31:13.698
All right. So that's
our cue. Let's move.

31:13.794 --> 31:15.194
Wait!

31:15.488 --> 31:17.135
I'm not sending you
into a suicide mission.

31:17.172 --> 31:18.831
There's another option.

31:19.158 --> 31:20.826
We can use the domestic drone program

31:20.894 --> 31:22.528
to neutralize the threat.

31:24.041 --> 31:26.153
I'm sorry, are you talking
about the DOD's secret program

31:26.190 --> 31:27.833
that we tried to shut down?

31:27.901 --> 31:30.686
It's still operational and I think
it's our best course of action.

31:30.765 --> 31:33.767
We can't kill a suspect using a drone.

31:33.875 --> 31:36.014
Albert Terrace murdered a cop

31:36.051 --> 31:38.286
and has surrounded himself
with deadly explosives.

31:38.493 --> 31:40.565
If I send you in there,
you are justified

31:40.602 --> 31:42.036
to use lethal force against him, right?

31:42.205 --> 31:45.274
But if I send a drone
to take out Terrace,

31:45.311 --> 31:47.245
then I don't have to risk
any of your lives.

31:47.282 --> 31:49.005
It's not up for debate.

31:52.074 --> 31:55.410
Patterson, clear law
enforcement from the area.

31:55.500 --> 31:57.835
I'm calling DOD.

31:58.415 --> 31:59.848
We can't let him do this!

31:59.885 --> 32:02.557
We don't have a choice.
He's the boss and he's right.

32:02.737 --> 32:04.634
Statistically,
this guy's gonna get killed

32:04.671 --> 32:06.311
whether it's a bullet from us
or a drone in the sky.

32:06.348 --> 32:09.384
- No! Reade, go and talk to him.
- I agree with Zapata.

32:12.204 --> 32:15.157
It is the safest course of action
if we want to minimize casualties.

32:15.223 --> 32:17.124
Our chance of making a peaceful
arrest is slim to none.

32:17.161 --> 32:19.796
- I know it's not what we usually do...
- No, because it's wrong.

32:20.222 --> 32:22.618
The drone has been authorized.

32:29.528 --> 32:30.995
<i>Target building acquired.</i>

32:31.134 --> 32:34.170
<i>Checking for any personnel
or vehicles. Stand by.</i>

32:36.269 --> 32:38.130
<i>Roger that. Clear to engage.</i>

32:38.192 --> 32:40.005
<i>Dropping hellfire.</i>

32:41.318 --> 32:42.708
<i>Good hit.</i>

32:55.121 --> 32:57.394
A drone attack is what
drove me back to Shepherd.

32:57.431 --> 33:00.199
It's what made me loyal to Sandstorm.

33:00.298 --> 33:04.101
Because our government did
exactly what we just did.

33:04.339 --> 33:07.232
- It's wrong.
- I agree with you,

33:07.511 --> 33:09.619
but there's nothing that we can do.

33:10.244 --> 33:13.179
Weitz has never suggested
the drone program before,

33:13.262 --> 33:16.931
and we've gone into plenty of
deadly situations on his watch.

33:17.323 --> 33:19.967
What's different about this case?

33:20.946 --> 33:23.386
Something's been bothering me all day.

33:23.472 --> 33:24.973
How did Albert Terrace know

33:25.017 --> 33:27.505
that we falsified evidence
in his daughter's case?

33:27.720 --> 33:30.789
The only person that knew about
that was Stuart and he's dead.

33:31.355 --> 33:33.716
There might be someone else.

33:44.050 --> 33:46.988
Special Agent Kurt Weller.

33:47.678 --> 33:49.879
To what do I owe the pleasure?

33:54.618 --> 33:58.855
I need some information about
the Williamsburg Bomber case.

33:59.118 --> 34:02.700
Interesting. Let's talk
about what I need.

34:05.744 --> 34:07.545
This is not a negotiation.

34:08.308 --> 34:10.965
I'm the only one
with the intel you want.

34:11.038 --> 34:12.871
I'd say it is.

34:20.422 --> 34:22.297
What do you want?

34:23.594 --> 34:25.902
A fair trial with a jury of my peers.

34:27.187 --> 34:28.905
You signed a plea deal.

34:29.744 --> 34:31.672
Life in prison for killing Stuart.

34:31.710 --> 34:33.177
I was forced to sign it.

34:33.481 --> 34:36.650
The CIA didn't really
give me any choice.

34:37.485 --> 34:40.721
I'll do what I can to
get you out of solitary.

34:41.447 --> 34:43.931
And a private room in
the Protective Custody Wing?

34:43.967 --> 34:46.502
This is prison, not a hotel.

34:46.699 --> 34:48.995
Well, then I guess
this conversation's over.

34:49.155 --> 34:51.797
Fine. I'll talk to Reade.

34:51.960 --> 34:56.730
If your intel is helpful,
I'm sure he can make it happen.

34:58.039 --> 35:02.053
Well, I'm an open book. Ask away.

35:02.287 --> 35:05.377
We know Stuart had falsified evidence.

35:06.069 --> 35:07.964
I don't think that's the whole story.

35:08.256 --> 35:12.569
That's right. Stuart didn't act alone.

35:14.092 --> 35:16.022
You haven't figured out yet

35:16.410 --> 35:20.647
that I was replaced by
someone just as duplicitous?

35:24.459 --> 35:26.801
I did something really bad.

35:26.959 --> 35:31.838
Okay. Well, whatever it is,
we can work it out.

35:32.240 --> 35:34.554
That evidence Rich found
of Lilly Terrace...

35:34.591 --> 35:35.900
Yeah.

35:37.045 --> 35:38.845
I planted it for him to find.

35:39.084 --> 35:40.967
I changed the timestamp.

35:41.069 --> 35:43.185
It was recorded three months ago.

35:43.826 --> 35:47.721
I'm sorry, but Weitz, he convinced
me it was the right thing to do.

35:47.866 --> 35:49.589
Weitz did this with you?

35:49.657 --> 35:51.691
It was his idea.

35:51.876 --> 35:56.557
I understand if you need
to fire me or arrest me.

35:57.324 --> 35:59.392
Well, that won't be necessary.

36:01.013 --> 36:03.715
Thank you for your trust, Stuart.

36:04.012 --> 36:05.579
As long as I'm here,

36:05.616 --> 36:09.545
you will always have
a place at the FBI.

36:10.178 --> 36:13.627
Relax. You saved a lot of lives today.

36:17.058 --> 36:22.052
So if you, Stuart, and Weitz are
the only ones who knew about this,

36:22.511 --> 36:25.292
then how did it get leaked
to someone in the public?

36:25.957 --> 36:28.019
That sounds like a you problem.

36:28.729 --> 36:30.130
We're done.

36:30.198 --> 36:33.400
Agent Weller, with
the right motivation,

36:33.582 --> 36:39.039
everyone has the capacity
to do bad things, even you.

36:43.074 --> 36:46.474
A few hours ago,
Albert Terrace killed himself

36:46.511 --> 36:48.215
with one of his own explosive devices.

36:48.550 --> 36:50.349
Tonight New York City is safe,

36:50.386 --> 36:52.152
thanks to the brave men and women

36:52.220 --> 36:56.423
of the FBI, the NYPD,
and New York State Police,

36:56.490 --> 36:58.692
who lost one of their own today.

36:58.759 --> 37:00.927
Know that justice has been served.

37:02.463 --> 37:04.164
No questions.

37:05.161 --> 37:07.898
We need to talk. Now.

37:09.468 --> 37:12.136
Okay, look, I know you're angry
about the press conference,

37:12.173 --> 37:14.274
but I had to lie about Albert
Terrace blowing himself up.

37:14.457 --> 37:18.368
The truth is, you used a drone to
kill him so he wouldn't expose you.

37:19.132 --> 37:21.166
I know that you manipulated Stuart.

37:21.593 --> 37:25.129
You forced him to falsify evidence.

37:25.920 --> 37:28.413
- Nope.
- I just talked to Hirst.

37:28.450 --> 37:31.658
You mean the former disgraced FBI
Director who murdered two people?

37:31.726 --> 37:33.693
Well, that settles that, then.

37:33.997 --> 37:36.263
- I am gonna expose you.
- For what?

37:36.330 --> 37:38.632
For sending a serial bomber
to prison two years ago?

37:38.699 --> 37:42.200
For stopping her father from
blowing up Manhattan today?

37:42.438 --> 37:44.309
You can't lie your way
out of this one, Weitz.

37:44.447 --> 37:46.448
Look, I know you don't
always agree with my methods,

37:46.485 --> 37:49.120
but you and I, we want the same thing.

37:49.585 --> 37:51.553
Like hell we do.

37:52.768 --> 37:56.249
You know, it would be a real
shame if the world found out

37:56.286 --> 37:57.903
that Jane Doe is a former terrorist

37:57.949 --> 38:00.450
who very recently planned
a fake nuclear attack.

38:02.686 --> 38:05.888
- You blackmailing me?
- No, I'm helping you

38:06.027 --> 38:08.528
by not telling the world that.

38:09.114 --> 38:11.197
I will find a way to take you down.

38:11.265 --> 38:14.200
Okay. That's what I thought.

38:14.268 --> 38:16.364
- Mm-hmm.
- Good talk.

38:23.650 --> 38:26.505
Two years ago, when you
asked why you should stay,

38:26.542 --> 38:27.979
there was a reason why I
didn't give you an answer.

38:28.015 --> 38:29.935
- Reade, you don't have to do this.
- Wait, please, please.

38:29.971 --> 38:30.895
Let me just get this out.

38:30.932 --> 38:33.006
You know I'm not good at this.

38:33.110 --> 38:34.611
That makes two of us.

38:35.554 --> 38:38.289
I wanted you to stay for me.

38:38.866 --> 38:40.233
But I could tell you weren't happy here

38:40.276 --> 38:41.372
and I didn't want to guilt you

38:41.409 --> 38:43.717
into staying someplace
you didn't want to be.

38:43.898 --> 38:45.966
And what do you want now?

38:46.393 --> 38:48.761
I want you to be a part
of this team again.

38:51.341 --> 38:53.473
The CIA is gonna keep coming after me.

38:53.541 --> 38:55.642
They think I betrayed
the agency and went rogue.

38:55.833 --> 38:58.211
Then we'll find Madeline,
take her down, and clear your name.

38:58.279 --> 39:00.942
- And until then?
- The CIA will have to go through me

39:00.979 --> 39:03.280
and the entire FBI first.

39:06.692 --> 39:08.403
Weitz blackmailed you?

39:08.450 --> 39:10.523
I nearly punched that
smug look off his face.

39:10.591 --> 39:13.293
Well, I'm glad you didn't.

39:13.361 --> 39:15.428
I prefer you out of prison.

39:16.067 --> 39:19.199
And I'm really happy
that you told me the truth.

39:19.755 --> 39:23.069
We've spent way too much time
keeping secrets from each other.

39:23.575 --> 39:25.927
It nearly destroyed us.

39:26.707 --> 39:28.575
I don't want to do that anymore.

39:28.642 --> 39:30.410
Me neither.

39:31.402 --> 39:36.139
- So, what do we do now?
- Nothing.

39:36.786 --> 39:41.321
I don't expose him,
he doesn't expose you.

39:41.731 --> 39:43.590
It's a stalemate.

39:44.184 --> 39:45.558
But if we take away his leverage,

39:45.626 --> 39:48.595
then we take away
Weitz's power over us.

39:48.662 --> 39:50.403
No.

39:50.614 --> 39:52.749
I don't want you
confessing to anything.

39:53.223 --> 39:56.002
I don't want you sacrificing yourself.

39:56.248 --> 39:58.239
I can't lose you again.

40:00.202 --> 40:01.813
Let's just forget about Weitz

40:01.850 --> 40:05.787
and just focus on you and me, hmm?

40:06.020 --> 40:08.714
Well, that sounds nice.

40:08.751 --> 40:11.185
No, let's focus on dinner
'cause I'm starving.

40:13.387 --> 40:15.927
Huh. Or not.

40:16.653 --> 40:19.973
- You are not the Thai food guy.
- Nope.

40:20.327 --> 40:23.692
Sorry. I don't mean to
bust in unannounced.

40:23.729 --> 40:25.697
No. Is everything okay?

40:25.734 --> 40:27.302
I solved Shepherd's puzzle.

40:27.396 --> 40:29.356
So, I wrote an algorithm

40:29.393 --> 40:30.994
that consolidated all of the pinpricks

40:31.031 --> 40:34.366
inside the wolf, and it made this.

40:34.675 --> 40:36.826
The number of dots in each row solved

40:36.863 --> 40:39.138
to a 3D printing code...

40:40.058 --> 40:42.497
and it made this key.

40:44.619 --> 40:46.153
What's that for?

40:46.235 --> 40:47.969
I don't know.

40:48.403 --> 40:51.622
Rich and I didn't find any clues
or directions in the puzzle.

40:51.721 --> 40:53.355
I'm sorry, Jane.

40:53.727 --> 40:55.128
I wanted to give you closure,

40:55.196 --> 40:56.830
but I don't know where to go from here.

40:59.138 --> 41:03.069
I do. I know exactly
what this key unlocks.

41:07.817 --> 41:09.776
Go for Weitz.

41:09.844 --> 41:11.725
<i>You thought you could use a drone</i>

41:11.761 --> 41:13.143
<i>to solve your problems,</i>

41:13.180 --> 41:14.981
<i>but you just made
a bigger one for yourself.</i>

41:15.049 --> 41:17.122
- Who is this? Albert?
- <i>No.</i>

41:17.661 --> 41:20.002
Once I found out
your dirty little secret,

41:20.092 --> 41:22.660
I knew he was the perfect patsy,

41:23.020 --> 41:25.892
so I made it look like he was avenging

41:25.960 --> 41:29.529
<i>his daughter and you all bought it
hook, line, and sinker.</i>

41:31.003 --> 41:32.437
Who are you?

41:33.380 --> 41:35.502
I'm the person who set off
the four bombs today

41:35.709 --> 41:37.210
<i>and I killed Albert Terrace.</i>

41:37.247 --> 41:39.372
<i>Couldn't exactly have him ruin my plan.</i>

41:39.440 --> 41:41.241
Who was setting off
explosives in the barn?

41:41.308 --> 41:42.848
<i>I was, from a safe distance.</i>

41:43.098 --> 41:45.678
I wanted to push you
to do something drastic,

41:45.746 --> 41:47.380
but, domestic drone?

41:47.448 --> 41:49.449
<i>You exceeded our wildest expectations.</i>

41:49.731 --> 41:52.919
"Our" expectations? What do you want?

41:53.208 --> 41:55.989
In the near future,
I'm gonna call for a favor,

41:56.056 --> 41:58.558
and you're gonna do everything I say.

41:58.911 --> 42:00.760
