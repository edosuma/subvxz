WEBVTT

00:00.834 --> 00:02.468
<i>Previously on</i>
<i>"The Practice"...</i>

00:02.503 --> 00:05.772
We find the defendant
Scott Wallace guilty.

00:05.806 --> 00:07.508
You got to get me out.

00:07.541 --> 00:09.643
-Scott--
-Get me out!

00:09.676 --> 00:12.579
You got a problem.
The man is on the verge
of a psychotic breakdown.

00:12.613 --> 00:15.381
He needs to be transferred
to a mental facility right now.

00:15.415 --> 00:17.618
We were hoping they'd order
a new trial outright.

00:17.651 --> 00:19.553
We didn't get that,
but with a hearing,

00:19.586 --> 00:22.556
if the judge determines that
the brother did commit perjury,

00:22.589 --> 00:24.424
then we get a new trial.

00:24.457 --> 00:25.826
Mr. Barrett, you had
a meeting with Richard Bay

00:25.859 --> 00:27.561
and Helen Gamble,
did you not?

00:27.594 --> 00:29.563
On the advice of counsel,

00:29.596 --> 00:31.565
I'm exercising
my fifth amendment right

00:31.598 --> 00:33.634
not to answer your question.

00:33.667 --> 00:36.202
I have been ordered
to conduct a full hearing

00:36.236 --> 00:37.771
into this perjury business.

00:37.804 --> 00:39.706
That hearing has been thwarted
by the primary witness

00:39.740 --> 00:41.775
exercising
his fifth amendment right.

00:41.808 --> 00:45.111
The conviction of Scott Wallace
is hereby set aside.

00:45.145 --> 00:48.281
It is the order of this court
that he be granted a new trial.

00:48.314 --> 00:51.117
"What to Expect When
You're Expecting."

00:51.151 --> 00:52.653
Somebody here's pregos.

00:52.686 --> 00:55.589
Lindsay, we might as well
tell them.

00:55.622 --> 00:58.258
-Did you order that book?
-Me? No.

00:58.291 --> 00:59.760
That little witch
tricked us.

00:59.793 --> 01:02.629
Either that,
or somebody else is pregnant.

01:02.663 --> 01:05.298
How did that book
get here?

01:05.331 --> 01:07.501
I ordered it.
I want to keep it a secret

01:07.534 --> 01:08.769
until I'm sure
everything's fine.

01:08.802 --> 01:10.136
Who's the father?

01:10.170 --> 01:12.573
I'm going to be
a single parent.

01:14.207 --> 01:15.709
It starts today?

01:15.742 --> 01:18.178
It's a simple trial--
One prosecution witness--

01:18.211 --> 01:21.181
You can't put me on a case
and expect that I'm going--

01:21.214 --> 01:23.717
Actually, I can, Eugene--
Perks of the robe.

01:23.750 --> 01:25.519
Now, he fired
his last lawyer

01:25.552 --> 01:27.521
just like the two
before that,

01:27.554 --> 01:29.723
and I have an obligation
to make sure

01:29.756 --> 01:32.325
he gets a fair trial
with adequate representation.

01:32.358 --> 01:34.327
Well, if you're
so concerned with fairness,

01:34.360 --> 01:36.797
how about giving me time
to fully prepare?

01:36.830 --> 01:39.533
Well, I'm not that concerned.
Let me be frank.

01:39.566 --> 01:41.668
The defendant
is world-class scum.

01:41.702 --> 01:43.670
I'm sure he's guilty
of the crime.

01:43.704 --> 01:45.672
Well, I'm glad
you have an open mind.

01:45.706 --> 01:47.674
Oh, please.
A mind is like a wound.

01:47.708 --> 01:49.743
If it's too open,
you get an infection.

01:49.776 --> 01:51.545
Now, he is stalling

01:51.578 --> 01:53.547
by firing one attorney
after another.

01:53.580 --> 01:57.483
I am not going to let him
get away with it anymore.

01:57.518 --> 01:58.885
Why me?

01:58.919 --> 02:00.754
Because you're as good
as it gets

02:00.787 --> 02:02.756
when it comes
to criminal law,

02:02.789 --> 02:05.626
and I don't want to give
this bastard a shot of appeal

02:05.659 --> 02:07.193
on inadequacy of counsel.

02:07.227 --> 02:10.163
So you will do it.

02:10.196 --> 02:11.898
Helen Gamble will be the D. A.

02:11.932 --> 02:15.201
We all know how jolly
she can be.

02:15.235 --> 02:17.337
See you in there.

02:17.370 --> 02:20.674
Go meet your lovely
wife-murdering client.

02:23.844 --> 02:25.145
â™ª (theme)

03:13.860 --> 03:16.563
I didn't do it.
The cop just wanted to get
his picture in the paper

03:16.597 --> 03:19.332
and credit for a big collar.
I wasn't even there that night.

03:19.365 --> 03:20.601
You live there.

03:20.634 --> 03:23.937
But I wasn't there
that night.

03:23.970 --> 03:28.008
Look, did her and I
have a fight? Yeah.

03:28.041 --> 03:30.544
Did I shoot her? No.

03:30.577 --> 03:32.913
They got
one lousy witness, man.

03:32.946 --> 03:34.615
Eyewitness evidence
is easy to shake, Mr. Young.

03:34.648 --> 03:36.617
It was dark.
I was moving fast.

03:36.650 --> 03:38.685
No way he got
a good clear look.

03:38.719 --> 03:40.687
So, if called to testify,

03:40.721 --> 03:43.690
you'll say
you were moving fast.

03:43.724 --> 03:46.426
I'm talking allegedly
by his account, man.

03:46.459 --> 03:47.961
I wasn't there.

03:47.994 --> 03:49.563
Right.

03:49.596 --> 03:51.565
When I left
in the afternoon,

03:51.598 --> 03:53.767
she was still alive.

03:53.800 --> 03:55.636
The cop is lying.

03:55.669 --> 03:57.370
All right, look,

03:57.403 --> 04:00.306
I'm not saying the D. A.
Will go for a plea,

04:00.340 --> 04:01.642
but if I can--

04:01.675 --> 04:03.644
No. I want you to beat it.

04:03.677 --> 04:05.579
One eyewitness
at nighttime, man--

04:05.612 --> 04:09.282
You got to be able to make
reasonable doubt on that.

04:18.825 --> 04:22.462
Six months on each count?

04:22.495 --> 04:24.330
No. Total.

04:24.364 --> 04:25.532
What?

04:25.566 --> 04:27.534
This is a liberal judge,

04:27.568 --> 04:30.070
and he can go easy
on sentencing, but--

04:30.103 --> 04:31.905
And this is important--

04:31.938 --> 04:33.807
He's probably going
to tell you a story

04:33.840 --> 04:35.809
about Ray Charles.

04:35.842 --> 04:37.410
What you mean
about Ray Charles?

04:37.443 --> 04:39.079
He lectures defendants.

04:39.112 --> 04:41.948
His favorite is
the Ray Charles story.

04:41.982 --> 04:45.752
It's corny, but you have
to take it seriously.

04:45.786 --> 04:47.888
I had a defendant
snicker once,

04:47.921 --> 04:49.956
and this guy
doubled the sentence.

04:49.990 --> 04:52.425
I want you to think
sad thoughts

04:52.458 --> 04:55.428
and just get through it
and show remorse.

04:55.461 --> 04:57.030
Okay.

04:57.063 --> 04:58.965
You take responsibility
for the crime.

04:58.999 --> 05:01.434
Don't be saying
you never had the drugs.

05:01.467 --> 05:02.969
Got it.

05:03.003 --> 05:04.738
And whatever you do,

05:04.771 --> 05:07.574
don't laugh.

05:07.608 --> 05:10.110
I'm looking at prison time,
Mr. Berluti.

05:10.143 --> 05:13.914
Ain't gonna be no laughing.

05:13.947 --> 05:16.449
HELEN: She was unconscious.

05:16.482 --> 05:19.452
You were afraid
of how it might look.

05:19.485 --> 05:21.454
You put her in the car

05:21.487 --> 05:23.389
to make it look
like a suicide.

05:23.423 --> 05:26.126
That's what happened,
isn't it?

05:26.159 --> 05:28.361
This is the part
that kills us.

05:31.031 --> 05:33.466
That's the bomb.

05:33.499 --> 05:35.468
This tape got admitted
for impeachment

05:35.502 --> 05:38.104
which prevented Scott
from testifying.

05:38.138 --> 05:40.073
You mean it made you
keep him from testifying.

05:40.106 --> 05:43.076
Right. I don't want to be
in that position again.

05:43.109 --> 05:45.011
If the judge let it in once,

05:45.045 --> 05:47.113
what makes you think he's
going to change his mind now?

05:47.147 --> 05:49.049
Judge Wolfe isn't the judge
for the new trial.

05:49.082 --> 05:51.985
We drew Judge Hiller.

05:52.018 --> 05:55.622
I was responding to a report
on a possible shooting.

05:55.656 --> 05:58.124
When I arrived at the house,
I saw the defendant

05:58.158 --> 06:00.727
leaving the side door
of the house, running.

06:00.761 --> 06:03.664
-This man?
-Yes.

06:03.697 --> 06:05.932
What did you do next,
Officer?

06:05.966 --> 06:08.401
I entered the premises
and discovered the victim--

06:08.434 --> 06:10.937
An African-American female
approximately 30 years of age

06:10.971 --> 06:12.906
with what apparently

06:12.939 --> 06:15.141
was a single gunshot wound
to the head.

06:15.175 --> 06:18.011
-She was dead.
-Yes, ma'am.

06:18.044 --> 06:20.480
When did you next see
the defendant, Officer?

06:20.514 --> 06:22.883
Two days later. I identified
him in a police lineup

06:22.916 --> 06:25.418
as being the man
I saw fleeing the house.

06:25.451 --> 06:27.453
Thank you.

06:28.922 --> 06:30.891
EUGENE:
To your knowledge, sir,

06:30.924 --> 06:33.093
were any fingerprints
found on the gun?

06:33.126 --> 06:35.028
The gun was never retrieved.

06:35.061 --> 06:38.031
Was any gunshot residue
found on my client's hands?

06:38.064 --> 06:39.900
No.

06:39.933 --> 06:42.168
To your knowledge,
was a trace-metal test done

06:42.202 --> 06:44.170
to see if my client
had even held a gun?

06:44.204 --> 06:46.807
The test came back negative,
but it was two days later--

06:46.840 --> 06:50.711
Thank you, sir.
You said you picked my client
out of a police lineup.

06:50.744 --> 06:52.713
-You recognized him?
-Yes.

06:52.746 --> 06:54.715
In fact, you had met
my client before, hadn't you?

06:54.748 --> 06:56.182
Once.

06:56.216 --> 06:59.119
You had responded
to a domestic conflict before

06:59.152 --> 07:01.187
-at his residence?
-Yes.

07:01.221 --> 07:03.123
When you saw my client
in the police lineup,

07:03.156 --> 07:05.125
is it possible
you recognized him

07:05.158 --> 07:06.927
because you had met him
before?

07:06.960 --> 07:09.730
No, I recognized him both
as a man I'd met before

07:09.763 --> 07:13.667
and as the man I saw fleeing
the house the night of the
shooting.

07:13.700 --> 07:17.203
-So the man was running
out a side door.
-Correct.

07:17.237 --> 07:20.006
-Toward the front of the house
or the back?
-The back.

07:20.040 --> 07:21.207
So he was running away
from you?

07:21.241 --> 07:22.876
I got a good look at him.

07:22.909 --> 07:25.211
He was running away
from you, sir, at night?

07:25.245 --> 07:27.213
I got a good look.

07:27.247 --> 07:30.483
Why were you playing
out of position?

07:30.517 --> 07:32.619
What?

07:32.653 --> 07:36.489
That's the term when you're
outside your assigned area.

07:39.059 --> 07:41.161
Call came in
of a possible shooting.

07:41.194 --> 07:43.229
You said you were on it,

07:43.263 --> 07:45.165
but you were
outside your patrol area.

07:45.198 --> 07:48.034
I wasn't that far
outside my area.

07:48.068 --> 07:50.504
-You weren't the closest unit.
-No.

07:50.537 --> 07:53.006
-Why'd you take the call?
-I recognized the address.

07:53.039 --> 07:56.242
Why were you playing
out of position, Officer?

07:57.911 --> 07:59.513
I don't remember.

08:01.181 --> 08:02.683
You don't remember.

08:08.021 --> 08:10.256
JIMMY: My client has been
in drug programs.

08:10.290 --> 08:12.258
He's clean.
He hasn't been using.

08:12.292 --> 08:14.260
He's willing to do
community service

08:14.294 --> 08:15.796
upon release, Your Honor.

08:15.829 --> 08:18.131
In fact, it's something
he wants to do.

08:18.164 --> 08:20.601
And the commonwealth
is okay with six months?

08:20.634 --> 08:23.537
We feel it's a little light,
but we're not opposing.

08:23.570 --> 08:25.205
All right. Step back.

08:27.841 --> 08:30.076
Mr. Babbit, please rise. Ahem.

08:30.110 --> 08:32.078
And before I sentence you,
young man,

08:32.111 --> 08:34.014
I want to talk to you,

08:34.047 --> 08:36.549
not as a judge
but as a teacher

08:36.582 --> 08:39.085
and, perhaps, as a friend.

08:39.119 --> 08:43.089
Now, I know that young men
like you rarely have the benefit

08:43.123 --> 08:46.092
of a male influence
in your community.

08:46.126 --> 08:52.098
Well, maybe for this one moment
in this very special place

08:52.132 --> 08:56.637
I can be a father to you
and a friend.

08:56.670 --> 09:00.273
I'd like to tell you
a little story-- a true story.

09:00.306 --> 09:02.242
Now, many years ago

09:02.275 --> 09:05.311
a little child was born
in the South--

09:05.345 --> 09:08.281
Poor, hungry, black,

09:08.314 --> 09:10.651
no direction,

09:10.684 --> 09:15.121
and more than that,
he was blind.

09:15.155 --> 09:16.957
But this boy had a gift.

09:16.990 --> 09:18.792
His gift was music.

09:18.825 --> 09:24.330
People loved to sit and listen
to this boy play the piano.

09:24.364 --> 09:27.734
But like you,
he had a monkey on his back--

09:27.768 --> 09:30.203
the monkey of drug addiction.

09:30.236 --> 09:34.340
He was addicted to heroin.
Lord God, he loved the needle.

09:34.374 --> 09:37.811
But you know what?
Blind, black,

09:37.844 --> 09:39.345
addicted to drugs,

09:39.379 --> 09:42.816
he beat his monkey.

09:42.849 --> 09:44.618
Beat it, I tell you.

09:44.651 --> 09:49.022
And he went on to become
a beloved American-- a hero--

09:49.055 --> 09:52.025
a black, blind, American hero.

09:52.058 --> 09:55.962
And that man had a name, son.

09:55.996 --> 10:00.634
His name was
Mr. Raymond Charles.

10:00.667 --> 10:03.369
Now, let this be the first day
of the rest of your life,

10:03.403 --> 10:05.371
young soldier--
a drug-free life.

10:05.405 --> 10:09.710
Go forward to make this world
a better place.

10:09.743 --> 10:11.712
(laughing)

10:18.084 --> 10:20.053
I'm sorry.

10:20.086 --> 10:21.855
I'm-- I'm sorry, Your Honor.

10:21.888 --> 10:26.392
-You think this is funny?
-No, sir.

10:26.426 --> 10:30.130
Well, I'm not impressed with
your disrespect, Mr. Babbit.

10:30.163 --> 10:33.199
Perhaps you're not quite ready
to go back into the world.

10:33.233 --> 10:35.001
-Your Honor--
-Never mind, Mr. Berluti.

10:35.035 --> 10:38.038
The defendant is sentenced
to 18 months at Cedar Junction.

10:38.071 --> 10:39.673
Eighteen months?

10:39.706 --> 10:41.808
Bailiff, take the defendant
into custody.

10:41.842 --> 10:44.645
We're adjourned.

10:51.317 --> 10:52.886
Let's go.

11:03.329 --> 11:05.298
His personnel file?

11:05.331 --> 11:08.168
I see he's receiving
psychiatric treatment.

11:08.201 --> 11:09.803
That would be
totally privileged.

11:09.836 --> 11:11.805
Ordinarily, yes,
but sometimes the courts

11:11.838 --> 11:13.874
have looked into the records
of police officers

11:13.907 --> 11:15.876
when they're relevant
to the case.

11:15.909 --> 11:17.477
And what would be
the relevance here?

11:17.511 --> 11:19.379
I don't know, Your Honor,

11:19.412 --> 11:21.815
but you saw him up there.
He's hiding something,

11:21.848 --> 11:23.884
and if there's anything
in those files

11:23.917 --> 11:26.252
that goes to his credibility,
I should be allowed access.

11:26.286 --> 11:27.821
You haven't made any showing,

11:27.854 --> 11:29.055
and you can't make
any offer of proof

11:29.089 --> 11:31.057
that there is anything.

11:31.091 --> 11:32.793
Helen, come on.

11:32.826 --> 11:34.728
I just got this case
with my morning cup of coffee,

11:34.761 --> 11:36.730
and I know Your Honor
doesn't want to give

11:36.763 --> 11:39.700
this world-class citizen
any grounds for appeal.

11:41.301 --> 11:44.270
I'll tell you what.
I will look at the report.

11:44.304 --> 11:46.106
If I see anything
that's relevant,

11:46.139 --> 11:48.108
I'll let you look.

11:48.141 --> 11:50.911
Otherwise, forget it.

11:56.249 --> 11:58.051
Taken out of context,

11:58.084 --> 11:59.520
it looks like an admission.

11:59.553 --> 12:01.354
It was in complete context.

12:01.387 --> 12:03.323
What's more,
silence is admissible.

12:03.356 --> 12:05.325
Failure to respond to
an accusation made against you

12:05.358 --> 12:07.193
can legally be considered
an admission.

12:07.227 --> 12:08.995
First of all,
that begs the conclusion

12:09.029 --> 12:10.997
that this was
a voluntary communication.

12:11.031 --> 12:13.333
Did your client
not get Miranda?

12:13.366 --> 12:16.202
He did, but he was in shock
at the time.

12:16.236 --> 12:18.138
I have submitted
to the court

12:18.171 --> 12:19.806
three psychiatric reports

12:19.840 --> 12:21.141
which question
the voluntariness--

12:21.174 --> 12:22.943
Oh, please, Mr. Donnell.

12:22.976 --> 12:25.345
Defense lawyers can hire
psychiatrists all the time

12:25.378 --> 12:28.481
to proclaim he didn't know
what he was saying.

12:28.515 --> 12:31.017
We have a man whose wife
was found dead,

12:31.051 --> 12:33.019
and he was still trying
to absorb that

12:33.053 --> 12:34.955
when the police
suddenly handcuffed him.

12:34.988 --> 12:36.890
Next thing, he's in a room
with the district attorney,

12:36.923 --> 12:39.059
a district attorney who now
believes he's innocent,

12:39.092 --> 12:41.327
-by the way.
-She never said that.

12:41.361 --> 12:45.231
It's too prejudicial to allow
a jury to see it.
It would bias them.

12:45.265 --> 12:47.433
What Mr. Donnell is saying
is he doesn't trust juries.

12:47.467 --> 12:49.503
Well, that's the system
of this country,

12:49.536 --> 12:51.905
and if it displeases him,
perhaps he should move to Cuba.

12:51.938 --> 12:54.040
Mr. Bay,
did you see the sign

12:54.074 --> 12:55.441
"Check your soapbox
at the door"?

12:55.475 --> 12:57.043
No.

12:57.077 --> 12:58.579
Do I need to hang one?

12:58.612 --> 13:01.114
The bottom line question is

13:01.147 --> 13:03.984
whether the potential
prejudice of this tape

13:04.017 --> 13:07.320
outweighs
its probative value.

13:07.353 --> 13:09.990
The answer is yes.

13:10.023 --> 13:12.258
Let them try Scott Wallace
on the evidence

13:12.292 --> 13:14.995
and the evidence alone,
not an emotional breakdown

13:15.028 --> 13:17.998
which occurred in the wake
of an unimaginable tragedy.

13:18.031 --> 13:20.000
This man is
in a psychiatric ward

13:20.033 --> 13:21.868
as we speak.

13:21.902 --> 13:23.970
-How convenient.
-You know what, Richard?

13:24.004 --> 13:28.374
All right.
I've heard the arguments.
I have your briefs.

13:28.408 --> 13:31.377
I'll take the matter under
advisement, and I'll rule.

13:31.411 --> 13:34.948
Thank you both.

13:34.981 --> 13:38.418
It was totally, totally,
totally my fault.

13:38.451 --> 13:40.954
I kept telling him
not to laugh.

13:40.987 --> 13:43.156
I think I put
so much pressure on him--

13:43.189 --> 13:47.528
Why would you have
to tell him not to laugh?

13:50.597 --> 13:53.233
Well, he gets
extremely nervous,

13:53.266 --> 13:56.436
and laughing
is a reaction he has.

13:56.469 --> 13:58.438
That's why.
I was so afraid

13:58.471 --> 14:01.107
he might get nervous
and laugh here,

14:01.141 --> 14:05.311
I kept hounding him,
and I just made it worse.

14:05.345 --> 14:08.381
He wasn't laughing at what
you were saying, Your Honor,

14:08.414 --> 14:10.116
I promise you.

14:10.150 --> 14:12.118
He sure seemed to be.

14:12.152 --> 14:13.554
He's a nervous kid.

14:13.587 --> 14:15.221
He's facing jail.

14:15.255 --> 14:17.490
Who's going to laugh
at that?

14:17.524 --> 14:20.561
To triple his sentence--

14:20.594 --> 14:23.597
Please, Your Honor.

14:25.532 --> 14:29.435
All right.

14:29.469 --> 14:31.437
I'll have him
brought back in.

14:31.471 --> 14:33.574
We can re-sentence,

14:33.607 --> 14:37.443
but I am giving you
and your client a break,

14:37.477 --> 14:39.445
Mr. Berluti.

14:39.479 --> 14:40.914
I understand that,

14:40.947 --> 14:43.349
and I'm very grateful,
Judge.

14:45.952 --> 14:47.588
My medical file?

14:47.621 --> 14:50.090
If the judge thinks
there's nothing relevant,

14:50.123 --> 14:52.258
they'll stay sealed.

14:54.194 --> 14:56.362
What's wrong?

14:56.396 --> 15:00.333
I've been married 17 years.
I have kids!

15:00.366 --> 15:02.468
Paul, what's the matter?

15:05.672 --> 15:06.707
I...

15:06.740 --> 15:08.575
What's in the file?

15:15.549 --> 15:17.250
I'm gay.

15:23.389 --> 15:26.259
When he said,
"playing out of position,"

15:26.292 --> 15:29.095
I thought for a second
he knew.

15:29.129 --> 15:32.098
So I froze up there
on the stand.

15:35.569 --> 15:38.038
It is totally irrelevant.

15:38.071 --> 15:40.373
That's my call, actually,
but thanks for your input.

15:40.406 --> 15:42.375
Well, I'm not so sure
it is irrelevant.

15:42.408 --> 15:44.377
If this situation
caused stress--

15:44.410 --> 15:46.246
-Well, it didn't.
-...which affected
job performance--

15:46.279 --> 15:47.981
That's what
it seems to suggest.

15:48.014 --> 15:50.050
His sexual orientation
did not impair his ability

15:50.083 --> 15:51.985
to make an I. D.
of a fleeing suspect, Eugene.

15:52.018 --> 15:53.987
Helen, this whole case

15:54.020 --> 15:55.722
turns on the credibility
of this officer.

15:55.756 --> 15:57.390
If he was dealing
with severe stress,

15:57.423 --> 15:59.125
I have to be allowed
to cross-examine him.

15:59.159 --> 16:00.994
-First, this is so collateral.
-I disagree.

16:01.027 --> 16:03.063
And second, it will ruin
the man's life.

16:03.096 --> 16:04.531
And a conviction ruins
another man's life.

16:04.565 --> 16:07.067
You really want
to go down that path?

16:07.100 --> 16:09.536
Your Honor, you want
to take me off this case, fine.

16:09.570 --> 16:12.005
-You will be despicable.
-But as long as I'm on it--

16:12.038 --> 16:13.540
I don't need that.

16:13.574 --> 16:15.275
All right.
I will let you introduce

16:15.308 --> 16:16.743
that he was receiving

16:16.777 --> 16:18.411
psychiatric treatment
for stress.

16:18.444 --> 16:20.446
The cause of that stress
is off-limits.

16:20.480 --> 16:22.148
I'd like to read
the report.

16:22.182 --> 16:24.551
Denied, and, Eugene,
you are not to even share

16:24.585 --> 16:26.419
this information
with your client.

16:26.452 --> 16:28.221
I don't think
you can order that.

16:28.254 --> 16:29.990
I just did.

16:35.128 --> 16:37.097
So, how are you feeling?

16:37.130 --> 16:38.765
I'm feeling better,
Bobby.

16:38.799 --> 16:39.766
You look better.

16:39.800 --> 16:41.067
I'm feeling good.

16:41.101 --> 16:43.036
No more spots?

16:43.069 --> 16:45.205
I want her to get you
a couple of new suits

16:45.238 --> 16:46.673
for trial, so she'll need
to take some measurements.

16:46.707 --> 16:49.075
This time I testify,
right?

16:49.109 --> 16:52.345
Well, let's see how the ruling
goes on the videotape,

16:52.378 --> 16:54.548
but hopefully,
you'll testify, yes.

16:54.581 --> 16:57.083
You got any good news?

16:57.117 --> 17:00.186
All they give you here
is Jell-O, damn it.

17:05.325 --> 17:08.294
Second trials typically
favor the defendant.

17:08.328 --> 17:10.763
There won't be any surprises
this time, Scott.

17:10.797 --> 17:13.233
We'll be ready
for Kyle Barrett.

17:13.266 --> 17:16.637
Good. Excellent.

17:16.670 --> 17:20.140
Good.

17:21.675 --> 17:24.310
BABBIT: And I just want
to apologize to the court

17:24.344 --> 17:26.311
if I showed any disrespect.

17:26.346 --> 17:28.582
It wasn't my intent
to offend you.

17:28.615 --> 17:30.584
I understand
from your attorney

17:30.617 --> 17:32.853
that you couldn't
control yourself?

17:32.886 --> 17:34.120
That's right.

17:34.154 --> 17:37.323
All right.

17:37.357 --> 17:39.760
But before I re-sentence you,

17:39.793 --> 17:42.195
I'd like to tell you
a little story

17:42.228 --> 17:47.200
about a woman, who like you,
lacked control sometimes.

17:47.233 --> 17:49.135
Like you, she had an addiction.

17:49.169 --> 17:52.138
Her addiction was gambling.

17:52.172 --> 17:54.340
Like you,
she wanted the fast life

17:54.374 --> 17:56.342
with fast cars,

17:56.376 --> 17:58.812
but she only got those things
when she learned

17:58.845 --> 18:02.348
to control herself
and beat her addiction

18:02.382 --> 18:04.751
when she learned to work hard,

18:04.785 --> 18:07.220
and she did work hard,
young man.

18:07.253 --> 18:10.356
She had the voice
of an angel,

18:10.390 --> 18:15.228
and with her golden voice
and hard work,

18:15.261 --> 18:19.833
she, too, beat her monkey,

18:19.866 --> 18:23.904
and that woman
had a name, son.

18:23.937 --> 18:26.773
Her name was...

18:26.807 --> 18:30.376
Miss Gladys Knight!

18:30.410 --> 18:31.477
Ha ha!

18:33.814 --> 18:35.415
I'm sorry.

18:36.950 --> 18:39.385
I was thinking
of something else.

18:39.419 --> 18:40.754
Me, too, I promise.

18:45.626 --> 18:49.462
The defendant is hereby
sentenced to 12 months

18:49.495 --> 18:51.397
on each count,

18:51.431 --> 18:53.534
the sentences
to run consecutively.

18:53.567 --> 18:55.435
Two years?

18:55.468 --> 18:57.504
Bailiff, take the defendant
into custody.

18:57.538 --> 18:59.205
We're adjourned.

19:17.257 --> 19:19.259
He can't introduce it.
He can only put it in

19:19.292 --> 19:21.562
that you were undergoing
treatment for stress.

19:21.595 --> 19:24.264
I've testified before.
These lawyers trick you.

19:24.297 --> 19:26.266
What if he twists
one of my answers

19:26.299 --> 19:27.801
and says I opened
the door?

19:27.834 --> 19:30.604
I will protect you.
You have my word.

19:30.637 --> 19:32.739
This Eugene Young
has a reputation.

19:32.773 --> 19:35.408
What does he care
if it's called a mistrial?

19:35.441 --> 19:37.678
For him, he'll do anything.

19:37.711 --> 19:39.445
Paul, within the law.

19:39.479 --> 19:41.748
Judge Kittleson was
very clear in her ruling.

19:41.782 --> 19:43.750
Mr. Young will abide by it.

19:43.784 --> 19:45.952
Listen...

19:45.986 --> 19:48.655
you just answer,

19:48.689 --> 19:51.491
"Yes, I suffered from stress,
and I sought treatment.

19:51.525 --> 19:53.894
It didn't affect me
that night."

19:53.927 --> 19:57.497
Keep it as simple as that,
but do not-- Do not lie,

19:57.531 --> 19:59.833
because then he can get in
the other stuff

19:59.866 --> 20:01.502
through impeachment.

20:01.535 --> 20:03.837
Just answer the questions,
don't elaborate,

20:03.870 --> 20:06.673
and I will protect you.

20:18.685 --> 20:22.656
I have read both your briefs.

20:22.689 --> 20:24.991
I also watched
the videotape again,

20:25.025 --> 20:28.529
and it is my conclusion...

20:28.562 --> 20:31.665
Judge Wolfe erred.

20:31.698 --> 20:34.801
Allowing the tape in
for impeachment purposes--

20:34.835 --> 20:37.671
His legal rationale escapes me.

20:37.704 --> 20:41.742
This tape is outright
admissible altogether.

20:41.775 --> 20:46.412
I'm permitting prosecution
to use it as evidence.

20:46.446 --> 20:48.414
Mr. Donnell, if you think

20:48.448 --> 20:50.751
the statements or conduct
of Mr. Wallace

20:50.784 --> 20:53.620
were a result of shock
or trauma,

20:53.654 --> 20:56.623
you're free to raise that
in your defense.

20:56.657 --> 20:58.692
That is all.

20:58.725 --> 21:01.494
The trial will begin
next Tuesday at 9:00 A. M.

21:01.528 --> 21:02.729
We're adjourned.

21:09.670 --> 21:11.938
You'll get our witness list
by the end of the day.

21:11.972 --> 21:13.607
I don't expect it to change.

21:13.640 --> 21:15.341
The transcripts are in.

21:15.375 --> 21:16.577
I'll have copies sent over.

21:16.610 --> 21:17.811
Thanks.

21:21.782 --> 21:24.518
I want to file a writ.
If that tape--

21:24.551 --> 21:26.853
Bobby, it was
the right ruling.

21:26.887 --> 21:28.454
I should at least try.

21:28.488 --> 21:30.456
No, you shouldn't.
We have six days

21:30.490 --> 21:33.059
to get ready for trial.
You can't waste time on writs.

21:33.093 --> 21:34.928
Let's focus on what
we can win now.

21:34.961 --> 21:36.763
You start preparing
the psychiatric experts.

21:36.797 --> 21:38.832
I'll go over the transcripts
with Ellenor.

21:42.903 --> 21:44.805
I'm obviously pleased
with the ruling.

21:44.838 --> 21:47.407
The commonwealth has always felt
that the statement

21:47.440 --> 21:49.610
was a de facto admission
and that it was evidence.

21:49.643 --> 21:51.678
I'm satisfied that a jury

21:51.712 --> 21:54.414
will now get to consider
that evidence. That is all.

21:54.447 --> 21:55.682
REPORTERS: Mr. Bay...

21:55.716 --> 21:58.018
MAN: This way, Mr. Bay.

21:58.051 --> 21:59.720
Can I get a picture,
Mr. Bay?

22:02.589 --> 22:06.359
Officer Brewer,
have you ever made arrests

22:06.392 --> 22:08.695
where the district attorneys
have refused to prosecute?

22:08.729 --> 22:11.598
-Of course.
-How many times?

22:11.632 --> 22:12.733
I'm not sure.

22:12.766 --> 22:14.467
-More than five?
-Yes.

22:14.500 --> 22:16.036
More than 10?

22:16.069 --> 22:17.137
Sometimes there's
insufficient evidence--

22:17.170 --> 22:18.672
More than 20?

22:18.705 --> 22:20.040
Objection.
What's the point of this?

22:20.073 --> 22:22.008
The point is this officer
sometimes claims

22:22.042 --> 22:23.944
a crime has been committed,

22:23.977 --> 22:25.912
only to have the D. A.
say otherwise.

22:25.946 --> 22:27.748
A district attorney's decision
to dismiss

22:27.781 --> 22:30.150
often turns on the prospect
of getting a conviction.

22:30.183 --> 22:32.919
It's not about overruling
the arresting police officer.

22:32.953 --> 22:35.556
Well, sometimes it does involve
the honesty of the officer,

22:35.589 --> 22:37.157
and that's what
I'm trying to explore.

22:37.190 --> 22:38.892
I'll allow it.

22:38.925 --> 22:41.762
Officer Brewer, how are you
on the issue of honesty?

22:41.795 --> 22:43.564
What is that
supposed to mean?

22:43.597 --> 22:45.632
Are you
an honest person, sir?

22:45.666 --> 22:47.500
Objection.
Sounds like badgering.

22:47.534 --> 22:49.435
Every witness, by testifying,

22:49.469 --> 22:51.905
puts his credibility in issue,
and I'm allowed to explore

22:51.938 --> 22:54.040
this man's reputation
for truthfulness.

22:54.074 --> 22:56.009
The objection is overruled.

22:56.042 --> 22:58.111
Do you consider yourself
to be a truthful person, sir?

22:58.144 --> 22:59.646
Yes.

22:59.680 --> 23:00.947
You live a truthful life?

23:00.981 --> 23:02.649
-Objection.
-Sustained.

23:02.683 --> 23:04.585
Are you receiving
psychiatric treatment, Officer?

23:04.618 --> 23:06.119
Yes.

23:06.152 --> 23:09.656
Does one of the issues for which
you are receiving treatment

23:09.690 --> 23:11.925
concern your ability
to be truthful?

23:11.958 --> 23:13.093
Objection.

23:13.126 --> 23:15.862
Overruled.

23:15.896 --> 23:17.163
It's beyond the scope--

23:17.197 --> 23:18.532
I'll allow it.

23:20.534 --> 23:22.603
Do you have trouble
being truthful?

23:25.171 --> 23:26.673
I'll repeat the question, sir.

23:26.707 --> 23:29.442
Do you have trouble
being truthful?

23:29.475 --> 23:31.678
Yes.

23:31.712 --> 23:34.848
In fact, you lie every day,
don't you, Officer?

23:34.881 --> 23:36.917
Yes.

23:36.950 --> 23:39.653
One of the reasons you sought
psychiatric treatment

23:39.686 --> 23:42.956
is you were afraid your lying
caused you such stress

23:42.989 --> 23:45.191
that it, perhaps,
started to affect your job.

23:45.225 --> 23:49.062
Isn't that right, Officer?

23:49.095 --> 23:50.897
Did you not hear
the question, sir?
I can repeat it.

23:50.931 --> 23:52.599
I heard the question.

23:55.035 --> 23:56.469
The answer is yes.

23:58.972 --> 24:03.209
Thank you, Officer.
I have nothing further.

24:14.888 --> 24:17.758
Mr. Beluti, I'm not interested.

24:17.791 --> 24:21.094
Your Honor, one second
he's about to get six months,

24:21.127 --> 24:24.197
now he'll do two years?
You know that isn't right.

24:24.230 --> 24:26.199
Well, maybe next time
that will mitigate
your amusement when--

24:26.232 --> 24:28.034
I apologize.

24:28.068 --> 24:31.772
Apology accepted,
but the sentence stands.

24:33.674 --> 24:36.677
It's one thing
to exercise discretion.

24:36.710 --> 24:39.713
It's another to flaunt
your ego, and this--

24:39.746 --> 24:42.649
Mr. Berluti, you are
two seconds from contempt.

24:42.683 --> 24:44.885
And before you go skulking
out of here,

24:44.918 --> 24:46.887
thinking of me
as the bad judge,

24:46.920 --> 24:51.257
keep in mind that I was
about to help your client,

24:51.291 --> 24:53.126
not only
with a lesser sentence,

24:53.159 --> 24:56.196
but also with some advice
that could help his life.

24:56.229 --> 24:58.665
Now, you defense attorneys
get them off.

24:58.699 --> 25:00.266
What do they do?

25:00.300 --> 25:03.604
They go right back out
and commit another crime.

25:03.637 --> 25:06.673
I try to reach them,
and I do.

25:06.707 --> 25:08.609
I tried to reach
your client,

25:08.642 --> 25:10.811
to offer his life
some direction

25:10.844 --> 25:13.079
like I have with so many
before him,

25:13.113 --> 25:14.948
and he laughed,

25:14.981 --> 25:17.818
as did his attorney.

25:17.851 --> 25:20.987
Maybe it's your ego
that needs adjustment.

25:29.029 --> 25:32.298
I laughed because I've heard
the Ray Charles story

25:32.332 --> 25:34.034
a zillion times,

25:34.067 --> 25:36.302
as have all the lawyers
who appear before you.

25:36.336 --> 25:38.839
We all tell our clients
it's funny.

25:38.872 --> 25:40.841
We all tell them
not to laugh.

25:40.874 --> 25:43.710
We're all afraid
they might laugh

25:43.744 --> 25:45.879
because it's so ridiculous.

25:51.752 --> 25:53.654
It's a joke, Your Honor.

25:53.687 --> 25:56.590
Poor, black, blind.

25:56.623 --> 25:58.592
"This man had a name, son."

25:58.625 --> 26:02.796
It's paternalistic,
insulting,

26:02.829 --> 26:05.666
and all the lawyers
laugh at you.

26:05.699 --> 26:08.802
I just made the mistake
of doing it in the room.

26:08.835 --> 26:11.271
If that buys me
a jail cell for contempt,

26:11.304 --> 26:13.139
so be it,

26:13.173 --> 26:15.676
but that's what's going on.

26:15.709 --> 26:18.945
You're naive to think
you reach defendants,

26:18.979 --> 26:21.615
and if you punish them
out of anger,

26:21.648 --> 26:25.051
you're also a bad judge.

26:28.388 --> 26:32.125
Mr. Berluti,
I will ask you once again

26:32.158 --> 26:35.228
to leave my chambers.

26:39.232 --> 26:43.036
I'm filing a motion
for reconsideration anyway,

26:43.069 --> 26:45.105
even though
I can't stop you

26:45.138 --> 26:47.340
from doing what
you're going to do.

26:55.949 --> 26:58.284
(door closes)

26:58.318 --> 27:00.654
You said you would
protect me!

27:00.687 --> 27:02.355
Everything he asked was arguably
within the proper scope.

27:02.388 --> 27:03.824
I tried to shut him down--

27:03.857 --> 27:06.126
You said you would
protect me!

27:06.159 --> 27:08.294
Well, I couldn't!

27:08.328 --> 27:11.865
Listen, Eugene Young
is a very smart lawyer.

27:11.898 --> 27:14.267
He doesn't want the jury
to know that you're gay

27:14.300 --> 27:16.937
or what the lie
is actually about.

27:16.970 --> 27:21.675
He knows the jury would just
dismiss it as irrelevant.

27:21.708 --> 27:26.880
Look, I'd like to introduce
what you're untruthful about.

27:26.913 --> 27:28.782
Excuse me?

27:28.815 --> 27:31.685
Paul, if we don't fill in
some of the blanks

27:31.718 --> 27:33.219
for the jury,

27:33.253 --> 27:35.689
your credibility
is shot with them.

27:35.722 --> 27:38.158
If we tell them what
Eugene is talking about,

27:38.191 --> 27:40.360
they'll know
you're not dishonest.

27:40.393 --> 27:42.829
And my family will know
I'm gay,

27:42.863 --> 27:45.365
my partners will know,
my life, my career--

27:45.398 --> 27:48.168
You're basically
the only witness we have.

27:48.201 --> 27:50.704
If we don't re-establish
your credibility,

27:50.737 --> 27:52.706
I can't convict here.

27:55.909 --> 27:57.844
Paul, the guy shot
and killed a woman.

28:00.747 --> 28:04.050
No.

28:04.084 --> 28:05.919
I can't do what
you're asking me to do.

28:05.952 --> 28:08.789
Well, I don't need
your consent, really.

28:08.822 --> 28:10.757
I'll figure out a way
to get it on redirect

28:10.791 --> 28:11.858
if I have to.

28:13.426 --> 28:15.061
You're gonna out me,
Miss Campbell?

28:15.095 --> 28:16.797
I don't know if I have a choice.

28:16.830 --> 28:19.499
Yeah, you do have a choice,
and so do I.

28:19.533 --> 28:21.334
If you--

28:21.367 --> 28:23.469
I'll recant. I'll say
it wasn't the defendant

28:23.504 --> 28:25.205
I saw that night.

28:25.238 --> 28:27.307
No, you won't, Paul.
You're an honest man.

28:27.340 --> 28:30.476
No, I think Mr. Young
established quite clearly

28:30.511 --> 28:31.745
that I'm not.

28:31.778 --> 28:33.146
If you commit perjury,

28:33.179 --> 28:35.381
your life and career
truly might be over.

28:35.415 --> 28:38.151
I'll make my life decisions.

28:39.886 --> 28:41.755
And I'll make mine.

29:00.541 --> 29:02.242
And I would submit
to the court

29:02.275 --> 29:03.777
given all the circumstances

29:03.810 --> 29:05.846
and especially
that the commonwealth

29:05.879 --> 29:08.448
and the defense have submitted
a joint recommendation--

29:08.481 --> 29:11.384
That's all it is,
Mr. Berluti--

29:11.417 --> 29:13.119
A recommendation

29:13.153 --> 29:16.122
either for the judge
to accept or reject.

29:16.156 --> 29:18.525
I have chosen
to reject it,

29:18.559 --> 29:20.794
and I find myself
very annoyed

29:20.827 --> 29:24.264
that you are back before
this bench with nothing new.

29:24.297 --> 29:26.332
If you have nothing new
to tell me,

29:26.366 --> 29:28.802
this hearing is over.

29:28.835 --> 29:31.805
What's new,
in addition to appearing

29:31.838 --> 29:33.273
as counsel for the defendant,

29:33.306 --> 29:35.909
I am here as an officer
of this court.

29:35.942 --> 29:38.845
I am standing up for
the integrity of this room.

29:38.879 --> 29:41.081
You were prepared
to issue one sentence,

29:41.114 --> 29:43.449
then gave another
because you got angry.

29:43.483 --> 29:46.152
You're entitled to
belittle yourself as a man

29:46.186 --> 29:47.854
and as a judge,

29:47.888 --> 29:49.823
but when you belittle
this room

29:49.856 --> 29:51.391
by abusing your discretion,

29:51.424 --> 29:53.894
I'm entitled to have something
to say about it.

29:55.962 --> 29:58.565
Is that all?

30:01.635 --> 30:04.170
No, sir, it is not.

30:05.639 --> 30:08.141
I want to speak to you,

30:08.174 --> 30:12.478
not simply as a lawyer,
but as a friend.

30:12.513 --> 30:15.148
There was this judge.

30:15.181 --> 30:17.618
She wasn't
very judge-like at all.

30:17.651 --> 30:20.020
She had terrible manners.

30:20.053 --> 30:22.488
She rambled on the bench.

30:22.523 --> 30:24.157
She had a big mouth,

30:24.190 --> 30:26.359
and she was obnoxious,

30:26.392 --> 30:29.229
and she had an ego.

30:29.262 --> 30:30.564
Lord, she had an ego

30:30.597 --> 30:32.566
just like you,
Your Honor.

30:32.599 --> 30:34.367
She also had a gift.

30:34.400 --> 30:36.903
She had the voice
of a crow,

30:36.937 --> 30:40.306
and she beat her monkey.

30:40.340 --> 30:42.308
She relished being obnoxious.

30:42.342 --> 30:44.578
She was proud
of mistreating people,

30:44.611 --> 30:47.514
and she used her ego
and her crow-like voice

30:47.548 --> 30:50.183
to make millions
of dollars,

30:50.216 --> 30:53.520
and she had a name,
Your Honor.

30:53.554 --> 30:56.189
Her name...

30:56.222 --> 30:58.592
was Judge Judy.

30:58.625 --> 31:00.226
(stifled laughter)

31:15.241 --> 31:17.544
Mr. Berluti,

31:17.578 --> 31:19.980
you are in contempt
of court.

31:21.381 --> 31:24.184
Bailiff, take him into custody.

31:29.255 --> 31:31.692
Officer, how many times
have you testified

31:31.725 --> 31:33.426
in criminal proceedings?

31:33.459 --> 31:35.428
Probably over 40.

31:35.461 --> 31:36.697
Have you ever been
accused of perjury?

31:36.730 --> 31:38.031
No.

31:38.064 --> 31:39.700
Ever had a case of yours
thrown out

31:39.733 --> 31:41.935
because of unreliable
testimony on your part?

31:41.968 --> 31:44.037
Not one.

31:44.070 --> 31:47.107
You also testified
that you see a psychiatrist.

31:47.140 --> 31:48.241
Yes.

31:48.274 --> 31:49.643
Do your supervisors know
about it?

31:49.676 --> 31:51.377
My watch commander does.

31:51.411 --> 31:53.379
Has he changed your assignments
because of it?

31:53.413 --> 31:55.381
-Put you on desk?
-No.

31:55.415 --> 31:57.718
You admitted to Mr. Young
that you lie almost every day.

31:57.751 --> 32:01.454
About a personal matter,
yes.

32:01.487 --> 32:03.990
Did it affect your work
on this particular case?

32:04.024 --> 32:05.358
No.

32:05.391 --> 32:06.993
Did you lie about
what happened

32:07.027 --> 32:08.595
the night Tasha Cooper
was killed?

32:08.629 --> 32:10.263
No, I did not.

32:10.296 --> 32:12.065
Have you ever lied
in your capacity

32:12.098 --> 32:13.534
as a police officer?

32:13.567 --> 32:16.002
No, I have not.

32:16.036 --> 32:18.204
When it comes
to making observations,

32:18.238 --> 32:19.640
making arrests,

32:19.673 --> 32:21.742
giving testimony
about those arrests,

32:21.775 --> 32:25.078
do you consider yourself
to be a truthful person?

32:25.111 --> 32:27.981
Yes, I do.

32:44.030 --> 32:46.232
Who was the man

32:46.266 --> 32:48.034
you saw fleeing
the house that night?

32:49.435 --> 32:54.340
That man there--
The defendant.

33:00.080 --> 33:02.248
Thank you, Officer.

33:04.484 --> 33:06.987
I have nothing further.

33:19.465 --> 33:22.736
It's a setback.
I won't kid you.

33:22.769 --> 33:25.105
Is this judge
going to go against us?

33:25.138 --> 33:26.740
No, she's extremely fair.

33:26.773 --> 33:28.408
She won't do us any favors,

33:28.441 --> 33:31.678
but this case won't be decided
by her.

33:31.712 --> 33:35.081
This time you will have
to testify.

33:35.115 --> 33:37.584
-I'm ready.
-I can handle
all the witnesses.

33:37.618 --> 33:40.053
We're in good shape there,
but that videotape

33:40.086 --> 33:42.656
and your response to it
on the stand--

33:42.689 --> 33:44.791
That's what will decide
this case.

33:44.825 --> 33:46.660
Well, I have better
focus now, Bobby.

33:46.693 --> 33:49.663
I mean, before I was
still in grief, you know?

33:49.696 --> 33:52.733
I couldn't believe
she was gone.

33:52.766 --> 33:57.203
But now when I think
of what she did--

33:57.237 --> 34:01.608
I mean, killing herself
right after we had a fight--

34:01.642 --> 34:04.344
I mean, that was
an angry act, Bobby.

34:04.377 --> 34:06.346
I mean, that wasn't
depression.

34:06.379 --> 34:08.481
She was doing it to me.

34:08.514 --> 34:10.817
That was hateful,

34:10.851 --> 34:12.753
and right now I hate her.

34:12.786 --> 34:14.420
Scott.

34:14.454 --> 34:16.422
I hate her,
and I'm not going to lie

34:16.456 --> 34:18.559
in some wallow any longer.

34:18.592 --> 34:22.262
Everything is easier now
being angry at her.

34:22.295 --> 34:25.831
I have my focus back.

34:25.866 --> 34:28.201
I hate her.

34:38.612 --> 34:42.783
One eyewitness who sees a man
at night from the side

34:42.815 --> 34:44.317
running away from him.

34:44.350 --> 34:45.552
Could he describe him?

34:45.585 --> 34:48.388
Black, medium build.

34:48.420 --> 34:50.857
No clothes, no distinguishing
characteristics--

34:50.891 --> 34:52.859
Just black, medium build.

34:52.893 --> 34:55.395
A black man in the dark
running away

34:55.428 --> 34:56.730
three, four seconds,

34:56.763 --> 34:59.265
but he got a good look.

34:59.299 --> 35:01.635
Now, we all know
what happened here.

35:01.668 --> 35:04.437
That man saw somebody running.
He then sees the wife dead,

35:04.470 --> 35:06.206
figures it must have been
the husband

35:06.239 --> 35:07.808
he saw going out the door.

35:07.841 --> 35:10.611
He then picks the husband
out of a lineup,

35:10.644 --> 35:12.879
but that was easy

35:12.913 --> 35:15.849
because he had met
the husband before.

35:15.882 --> 35:19.820
No weapon, no gunshot residue
on my client's hands,

35:19.853 --> 35:22.488
nothing to suggest
he had even held a gun,

35:22.523 --> 35:24.157
much less fired one.

35:24.190 --> 35:26.660
That police officer
made a guess,

35:26.693 --> 35:28.829
and he's sticking
by his hunch.

35:28.862 --> 35:30.664
That's what this is,
and we all know it.

35:30.697 --> 35:34.601
One three-second I.D.
in the dark by
a self-confessed liar--

35:34.635 --> 35:37.470
That isn't proof.

35:37.504 --> 35:40.173
Their whole case comes down
to the say-so

35:40.206 --> 35:42.643
of a man receiving
psychiatric treatment

35:42.676 --> 35:46.412
to deal with stress
caused by his inability

35:46.446 --> 35:48.248
to tell the truth.

35:50.383 --> 35:52.352
Do I really need to stand here

35:52.385 --> 35:54.655
and tell you
there's reasonable doubt?

35:56.790 --> 35:58.892
No other prints,

35:58.925 --> 36:03.196
no DNA, no physical
or testimonial evidence

36:03.229 --> 36:06.833
to even suggest that anyone else
was in that house that night.

36:06.867 --> 36:09.402
No other cars in the area.

36:09.435 --> 36:12.506
The intruder fled on foot.

36:12.539 --> 36:15.441
It was that man
fleeing the house.

36:15.475 --> 36:17.377
Officer Brewer saw him.

36:17.410 --> 36:19.513
He was unequivocal in that.

36:19.546 --> 36:21.515
The defendant, Brian Grant,

36:21.548 --> 36:23.917
was the man he saw
leave that house.

36:23.950 --> 36:26.920
Defense has offered
neither evidence nor testimony

36:26.953 --> 36:28.889
to shake that I. D.

36:28.922 --> 36:32.258
All Mr. Young could seize upon
was some psychiatric treatment

36:32.292 --> 36:33.894
that Officer Brewer
is undergoing

36:33.927 --> 36:36.563
for a personal matter.

36:36.597 --> 36:39.933
Yes, he lies about something
in his personal life.

36:39.966 --> 36:41.868
Big deal. We get that.

36:41.902 --> 36:44.404
But he doesn't lie
as a police officer.

36:44.437 --> 36:47.541
It doesn't make him
an unreliable witness.

36:47.574 --> 36:50.276
In fact, in 21 years,

36:50.310 --> 36:52.946
Officer Brewer has had
an exemplary record of honesty

36:52.979 --> 36:54.615
on the force.

36:54.648 --> 36:57.283
He's never given
untruthful testimony.

36:57.317 --> 36:59.620
He's never been a false witness.

36:59.653 --> 37:02.956
His honor has been
beyond reproach,

37:02.989 --> 37:06.760
just as his testimony is here
when he tells you

37:06.793 --> 37:10.631
that's the man
he saw leave that house.

37:10.664 --> 37:12.633
You haven't heard one word

37:12.666 --> 37:15.368
suggesting that anyone else
committed this murder.

37:15.401 --> 37:19.039
Gee, I wonder why.

37:19.072 --> 37:21.575
He's home alone with his wife.

37:21.608 --> 37:23.610
He shot her.

37:23.644 --> 37:26.312
He's seen running out.

37:26.346 --> 37:29.415
That's why we're here.

37:40.961 --> 37:42.796
Go.

37:45.532 --> 37:48.401
The only reason
I don't keep you overnight

37:48.434 --> 37:51.705
for what I deem to be
criminal disrespect...

38:05.719 --> 38:09.690
How long have they
been laughing at me?

38:09.723 --> 38:11.324
Long time.

38:15.028 --> 38:17.631
How long you been telling
that Ray Charles story?

38:20.066 --> 38:22.035
At least I try
to do something.

38:22.068 --> 38:24.437
I care, at least.

38:24.470 --> 38:26.072
Most judges...

38:34.615 --> 38:37.584
Tell your client
I'll give him six months.

38:37.618 --> 38:38.785
Beat it.

38:40.020 --> 38:41.988
That's it?

38:42.022 --> 38:45.792
You want a story first,
Counsel?

38:47.393 --> 38:48.461
No.

38:50.864 --> 38:52.065
Just go.

39:13.754 --> 39:17.157
Came back kind of fast.

39:17.190 --> 39:19.159
That mean anything?

39:19.192 --> 39:22.362
Usually it means
it was a quick decision.

39:23.964 --> 39:27.067
Mr. Grant, the court
will ask you to stand, please.

39:30.070 --> 39:32.072
Mr. Foreman, has the jury
reached a verdict?

39:32.105 --> 39:33.106
We have, Your Honor.

39:33.139 --> 39:34.541
What say you?

39:34.575 --> 39:36.577
Commonwealth v. Brian Grant,

39:36.610 --> 39:38.411
on the charge of murder
in the first degree,

39:38.444 --> 39:43.684
we find the defendant
Brian Grant not guilty.

39:43.717 --> 39:46.520
On the charge of murder
in the second degree,

39:46.553 --> 39:49.656
we find the defendant
Brian Grant...

39:49.690 --> 39:50.791
not guilty.

39:54.995 --> 39:56.863
Members of the jury,
your service is completed,

39:56.897 --> 39:58.699
and we thank you.

39:58.732 --> 40:02.168
The defendant is free to go,
and we are adjourned.

40:02.202 --> 40:03.704
(gavel pounds)

40:03.737 --> 40:05.906
Wow.

40:05.939 --> 40:07.173
Thanks, man.

40:07.207 --> 40:08.909
Sure.

40:08.942 --> 40:10.443
Innocent till proven guilty.

40:10.476 --> 40:12.045
The motto lives.

40:12.078 --> 40:14.080
See you next time.

40:14.114 --> 40:16.617
Good one.

40:24.558 --> 40:26.660
I'm sorry we didn't get him.

40:26.693 --> 40:27.928
Yeah.

40:27.961 --> 40:29.863
Did our best.

40:29.896 --> 40:32.465
Miss Gamble?

40:32.498 --> 40:35.468
Thank you.

40:35.501 --> 40:37.203
I wish you well, Paul.

40:37.237 --> 40:39.840
You, too.

40:55.622 --> 40:58.825
I really appreciate you
coming in with your client.

40:58.859 --> 41:00.894
It's against
my better judgment.

41:00.927 --> 41:02.228
I totally understand.

41:02.262 --> 41:04.531
It's just,
lawyer to lawyer,

41:04.565 --> 41:06.700
you're aware
that Helen Gamble

41:06.733 --> 41:08.168
believes your client
committed perjury

41:08.201 --> 41:09.570
in the first trial.

41:09.603 --> 41:11.037
Ms. Gamble was mistaken.

41:11.071 --> 41:12.973
Yes, well,
I don't believe she was.

41:13.006 --> 41:15.108
Mr. Donnell, I'm confused
as to the agenda here.

41:15.141 --> 41:16.610
-Certainly we can--
-The agenda is this.

41:16.643 --> 41:18.512
I'm putting you on notice.

41:18.545 --> 41:21.214
If your client takes
the stand again and lies,

41:21.247 --> 41:23.216
I'll be taking his house.

41:23.249 --> 41:25.786
-Bobby?
-Tell him, Mr. Stone.

41:25.819 --> 41:27.788
Tell him the exposure
he faces--

41:27.821 --> 41:30.156
Abuse of process,
false imprisonment.

41:30.190 --> 41:32.125
I don't know what
you think you're doing.

41:32.158 --> 41:34.094
If he lies again,
I'll be filing a complaint

41:34.127 --> 41:36.096
against you
for suborning perjury.

41:36.129 --> 41:38.732
I'm reporting this to
the district attorney's office.

41:38.765 --> 41:40.601
You do that,
but in the meantime,

41:40.634 --> 41:42.769
get around to giving
your client some legal advice.

41:42.803 --> 41:44.204
Come on, Kyle.

41:47.741 --> 41:51.244
Tell him what I'll do to him,
Mr. Stone.

41:51.277 --> 41:54.047
Tell him.

41:54.080 --> 41:56.883
You just crossed the line,
Mr. Donnell.

41:56.917 --> 42:00.754
We're just two lawyers
talking, Mr. Stone--

42:00.787 --> 42:03.056
Just you and me.

42:08.128 --> 42:09.896
What the hell
do you call that?

42:09.930 --> 42:11.898
I call it intimidating
a lead witness

42:11.932 --> 42:13.099
for the prosecution.

42:13.133 --> 42:15.101
I got to keep
that lying bastard

42:15.135 --> 42:16.970
out of the witness chair.

42:17.003 --> 42:19.305
You've got a lawyer
in there

42:19.339 --> 42:21.307
who just threatened
my client.

42:21.341 --> 42:24.978
Really? With you there?

42:25.011 --> 42:27.213
Call the police.

42:34.354 --> 42:36.289
Come in.

42:41.227 --> 42:43.597
I came to congratulate you.

42:43.630 --> 42:47.067
And I get
a personal visit for that?

42:47.100 --> 42:51.337
That, and the police
just got into a shootout

42:51.371 --> 42:54.007
with the man who fired back

42:54.040 --> 42:56.643
with the gun
used to kill Tasha Cooper.

42:56.677 --> 42:59.212
He matched the description
of the suspect

42:59.245 --> 43:01.648
Officer Brewer saw running,

43:01.682 --> 43:03.917
and he also confessed
to the crime.

43:06.419 --> 43:10.356
I know you didn't care
if your client was guilty.

43:10.390 --> 43:14.695
I thought you might
be interested to know

43:14.728 --> 43:16.229
he was innocent.

43:40.754 --> 43:43.256
â™ª (theme)

44:06.446 --> 44:08.114
You stinker!
