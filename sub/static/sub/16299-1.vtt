02:14.635 --> 02:15.869

02:18.639 --> 02:19.940

02:19.973 --> 02:21.342

his impressive military career.

02:43.764 --> 02:46.334
I mean, you're getting pieces
of how romantic he is,

02:46.367 --> 02:48.536
- but you're just...
- I need you.

02:48.569 --> 02:50.538

02:52.806 --> 02:54.642
So, if this is your thesis,

02:54.675 --> 02:56.310
you need to focus
your explication

02:56.344 --> 02:57.778
on his utopian ideals.

02:57.811 --> 03:00.248
No, you can do this.

04:45.819 --> 04:48.789

04:50.491 --> 04:52.059

line today at the office.

05:03.036 --> 05:05.606

05:07.107 --> 05:09.477

05:09.510 --> 05:11.812

to steal you away.

05:35.636 --> 05:37.605
- Hey.
- Derrick, get me your paper.

05:37.638 --> 05:38.872
Apple, we have an agreement.

05:38.906 --> 05:40.140
You write my papers for me,

05:40.173 --> 05:41.975
and I run around
with my shirt off.

05:42.009 --> 05:43.844
- That is not our agreement.
- You said it.

05:43.877 --> 05:44.945
- Never.
- You said that.

05:46.814 --> 05:48.115
What, what happened?

05:48.148 --> 05:49.783
Was there a fire?

05:49.817 --> 05:51.652
Yeah, only in my room.

05:51.685 --> 05:53.421
I barely made it out alive.

05:53.454 --> 05:55.423
- Are you okay?
- [Laughs]

05:55.456 --> 05:57.825
Are you seriously
taking me literally?

05:57.858 --> 05:59.960
I'm going to Oxford.

05:59.993 --> 06:01.495
Yeah, they disbanded
the rugby team,

06:01.529 --> 06:02.896
and my dad's having me transfer.

06:02.930 --> 06:04.708
You know, year off rugby
and the national team

06:04.732 --> 06:06.634
- wouldn't even look at me.
- That's ridiculous.

06:06.667 --> 06:08.101
Apparently we're breaking
title 9.

06:08.135 --> 06:09.570
Title, title 9.

06:09.603 --> 06:11.138
Where there has to be
and equal number

06:11.171 --> 06:13.474
- of male and female sports?
- Yep, that's the one.

06:13.507 --> 06:15.443
That's it? That's no problem.
I can fix it.

06:15.476 --> 06:17.778
No, you can't fix it, apple.
You can't fix everything.

06:17.811 --> 06:18.912
Yes, I can.

06:18.946 --> 06:20.614
So, okay, the rugby team

06:20.648 --> 06:22.850
has a minimum of seven players
on the field, right?

06:22.883 --> 06:24.618
So we need a
seven player female team.

06:24.652 --> 06:25.919
We'll go with softball.

06:25.953 --> 06:27.588
- Ah, but they're so tomboy.
- Hmm.

06:27.621 --> 06:29.089
Well, volleyball.

06:29.122 --> 06:31.158
Ugh. They're really tall.
[Gasps] Oh, I know!

06:31.191 --> 06:32.993
- Apple, stop.
- Unpack, unpack.

06:33.026 --> 06:34.695
- Please stop.
- Unpack, unpack.

06:34.728 --> 06:36.630
- What're you doing?
- I am gonna make...

06:36.664 --> 06:38.932
- The gymnastics team.
- Oh.

06:38.966 --> 06:40.934
[Laughs]

06:40.968 --> 06:42.836
That's cute.
That's really cute.

06:42.870 --> 06:45.172
You know, you are such a
good fixer, you really are

06:45.205 --> 06:47.007
and I appreciate
you trying to fix this,

06:47.040 --> 06:49.009
but, it's not Emily's nail.

06:49.042 --> 06:50.911
Okay, this is real, apple.

06:50.944 --> 06:53.614
We're talking about the NCAA.

06:53.647 --> 06:56.016
Look, we both know that you
shouldn't even be at Greene.

06:56.049 --> 06:58.486
It's the most prestigious
university in the country,

06:58.519 --> 06:59.887
and your parents are legacies

06:59.920 --> 07:01.789
and they donate
thousands of books a year.

07:01.822 --> 07:03.624
So, you're here.

07:03.657 --> 07:07.094
I had a perfect sat,
and I was a gymnast.

07:07.127 --> 07:08.929
When you were 13.

07:08.962 --> 07:11.599
You don't have an athletic
bone in your body.

07:11.632 --> 07:13.901
You drove your
sobriety's annual 5k.

07:13.934 --> 07:16.604
Because they needed
a safety driver.

07:16.637 --> 07:18.939
You're skinny-fat.

07:18.972 --> 07:20.841
I'm sorry,
but someone had to tell you.

07:20.874 --> 07:22.209
Here's the test.
Ready?

07:22.242 --> 07:23.844
- One, two, three...
- Stop...

07:23.877 --> 07:24.912
- No.
- Exactly.

07:24.945 --> 07:26.246
- No gymnast...
- Exactly.

07:26.279 --> 07:27.781
No gymnast could catch that.

07:27.815 --> 07:29.483
Gymnastics is not a ball sport.

07:29.517 --> 07:30.818
Come here.

07:30.851 --> 07:32.686
We had a great run.

07:32.720 --> 07:35.122
You know, and I really thought
that you could be the one.

07:35.155 --> 07:37.024
- I know. -I thought
you could, but, um...

07:37.057 --> 07:38.158
- Todd.
- I gotta move on.

07:38.191 --> 07:39.693
- Todd.
- Boop.

07:39.727 --> 07:40.961
- No.
- Here. Oh...

07:40.994 --> 07:42.663
- Stop doing that.
- Take these.

07:42.696 --> 07:44.064
Okay, we'll talk later.

07:46.133 --> 07:47.801
Okay, good riddance.

07:49.670 --> 07:52.139
"Could be the one"?
I'm totally the one.

07:52.172 --> 07:53.941
Moving to Oxford.
[Scoffs]

07:53.974 --> 07:55.242
He's just in shock, right?

07:55.275 --> 07:57.210
The thing he loves
second most in the world

07:57.244 --> 07:59.079
was just taken away from him.

07:59.112 --> 08:01.615
It's gotta be shock.
He's not leaving me really.

08:01.649 --> 08:05.185
I think his plane left
this afternoon.

08:05.218 --> 08:07.254
All I've got to do
is form the team,

08:07.287 --> 08:10.190
get the buy-in from the athletic
director, and petition the NCAA.

08:10.223 --> 08:13.527
Bing, bang, done. Rugby team
is back, and I'm engaged.

08:13.561 --> 08:16.163
Socrates, really, on the
"intro to philosophy" paper?

08:16.196 --> 08:18.265
So obvious.

08:18.298 --> 08:19.967
You might as well
quote Mickey mouse

08:20.000 --> 08:21.301
on the "intro to Disney" paper.

08:21.334 --> 08:22.970
Just redo it.

No, frat guys are out.

08:30.143 --> 08:32.044

I'll get you an "a."

08:32.078 --> 08:33.813
Ah, I think I can find
your boyfriend.

- Ah, all right, here you go.

08:58.038 --> 09:00.173
Just so terrible.

09:00.207 --> 09:02.342
Mit?
Absolutely not.

09:02.375 --> 09:05.278
Greene students only.
Get out of here.

09:05.312 --> 09:07.280
- [Cell phone ringing]
- Ooh.

09:07.314 --> 09:10.818
- Break.
- Oh, come on.

09:10.851 --> 09:12.319
Seriously?

09:12.352 --> 09:14.855
Mama, thank heavens.

09:14.888 --> 09:17.858
[Mom] Hi, apple. So, he's left.

09:17.891 --> 09:19.860
Todd's family is Greene elite.

09:19.893 --> 09:21.194
He's already upped your image

09:21.228 --> 09:22.730
by staying with you this long.

09:22.763 --> 09:25.065
We couldn't expect him
to last forever.

09:25.098 --> 09:26.934
We couldn't?
No, mom.

09:26.967 --> 09:28.602
I've already started
the paperwork

09:28.636 --> 09:30.003
for the women's gymnastic team.

09:30.037 --> 09:31.605
He'll be back.
It's a no-brainer.

09:31.639 --> 09:33.140
[Mom] Oh, apple,
you can't fix this.

09:33.173 --> 09:35.142
- Yes, I can.
- [Mom] Let it go.

09:35.175 --> 09:37.845
Sure, we got you into Greene
to find a husband,

09:37.878 --> 09:39.613
but obviously
Todd just isn't the one.

09:39.647 --> 09:42.950
Start looking at the other
guys in your classes.

09:42.983 --> 09:44.918
Figure out who's single...

09:44.952 --> 09:47.254
Mom, I can be
more than a girlfriend.

09:47.287 --> 09:49.657
[Mom] Let's be serious.
What have you really done

09:49.690 --> 09:51.291
since you've been there?

09:51.324 --> 09:53.827
I started my own business
grading students papers.

09:53.861 --> 09:56.329
[Mom] Honey, we are
Mccreighton-hill.

09:56.363 --> 09:58.999
We sent you all the answer keys.

09:59.032 --> 10:00.701
Well, it's just
who you are, honey.

10:00.734 --> 10:03.203
A pretty peppy girl.
Embrace it.

10:03.236 --> 10:06.373
Focus on your business
classes not liberal arts.

10:06.406 --> 10:07.908
They're happy middle class.

10:07.941 --> 10:10.243
Dixie!
Get off the chaise lounge!

10:10.277 --> 10:12.112
I gotta go.
Kisses.

10:12.145 --> 10:14.848
- N-no, no, mom.
- [Dial tone]

10:14.882 --> 10:17.350
Uh, a minute 30.

10:17.384 --> 10:19.720
Yep, a new record.

10:21.889 --> 10:23.857
I can be more than a girlfriend.

10:23.891 --> 10:26.794
Absolutely. You are
going to be a wife.

10:33.233 --> 10:35.002
We should set up
between the two trees

10:35.035 --> 10:36.670
using space over there.

10:38.338 --> 10:41.709
- Apple.
- Oh, Emily.

10:41.742 --> 10:43.210
- Apple.
- Emily.

10:43.243 --> 10:45.212
How are you?

10:45.245 --> 10:47.748
This is Tanya
my wedding coordinator.

10:47.781 --> 10:49.917
We're mapping out seating
on the quad.

10:49.950 --> 10:52.452
- We know each other.
- She has me on retainer.

10:52.485 --> 10:54.454
- Ooh.
- Can't wait for yours.

10:54.487 --> 10:56.790
Todd moved to Oxford.

10:56.824 --> 10:59.292
What?
Besties.

10:59.326 --> 11:01.128
English wedding are divine.

11:01.161 --> 11:03.363
And, left apple here.

11:05.799 --> 11:07.034
Oh, honey.

11:10.103 --> 11:12.072
No, no, it's fine.

11:12.105 --> 11:14.241
It's fine. And I've got
a meeting to run to.

11:14.274 --> 11:16.777
- Okay.
- Of course you do.

11:16.810 --> 11:18.912
- Bye-bye.
- That's it, honey.

11:18.946 --> 11:22.349
Make a new life for yourself.

11:22.382 --> 11:24.284
Maybe I shouldn't have
said anything.

11:50.944 --> 11:53.446
- Although your presentation is...
- Impeccable.

11:53.480 --> 11:55.816
Disturbingly informative,

11:55.849 --> 11:57.951
I can't just form a varsity
team out of thin air.

11:57.985 --> 12:01.254
But you have a gym
just sitting on campus unused.

12:01.288 --> 12:04.091
Plus, it says here
in the NCAA manual,

12:04.124 --> 12:07.027
that once the gymnastics roster
is certified eligible,

12:07.060 --> 12:08.796
the rugby team
can be back on the field.

12:08.829 --> 12:10.430
Bing, bang, done.

12:10.463 --> 12:13.066
I'm sorry. What is your
interest in this again?

12:13.100 --> 12:15.235
Mr. Kelly...

12:15.268 --> 12:18.038
- May I call you Preston?
- No.

12:18.071 --> 12:19.539
We both know that rugby alumni

12:19.572 --> 12:21.909
make up the second
largest donation pool

12:21.942 --> 12:24.244
at $255,692 a year.

12:24.277 --> 12:26.914
Are you really willing
to give up all those donors

12:26.947 --> 12:28.849
just because you're not adhering
to title 9?

12:28.882 --> 12:30.183
How would, how do you know the,

12:30.217 --> 12:31.451
just the exact amount?

12:31.484 --> 12:34.454
Your firewall is junk.
I hacked it...

12:34.487 --> 12:36.990
I found it in seconds.

12:37.024 --> 12:38.992
Look, these are the
simple steps to success.

12:39.026 --> 12:41.161
Okay.

12:41.194 --> 12:45.298
Recruit a team.
Certify eligibility.

12:45.332 --> 12:48.068
Practice.
Compete.

12:48.101 --> 12:49.937
All you have to do
is allow me to start

12:49.970 --> 12:51.805
the women's gymnastics team.

12:51.839 --> 12:54.474
[Laughs]
No.

12:54.507 --> 12:56.309
I want you to go.

12:57.544 --> 12:59.512
No, he said absolutely not

12:59.546 --> 13:02.215
in no way would he allow me
to mar his athletic legacy

13:02.249 --> 13:04.117
with harebrained idea like this.

13:04.151 --> 13:05.986
- So it's a maybe.
- Totally.

13:06.019 --> 13:08.121
- On to plan b?
- Yay! I love plan b.

13:18.899 --> 13:20.868
All right,
we start with recruiting.

13:20.901 --> 13:24.371
Should be easy. There's got to
be lots of gymnasts at Greene.

13:28.942 --> 13:31.511
There are no gymnasts at Greene.

13:31.544 --> 13:35.082
But we found 12 former
gymnasts in the database.

13:35.115 --> 13:36.583
I know.
I talked to all of them.

13:36.616 --> 13:38.485
Only Emily said
she would on the team

13:38.518 --> 13:41.488
if I agreed
to hand tie 600 ribbons

13:41.521 --> 13:44.291
on her wedding invitations.

13:44.324 --> 13:47.194
One even told me that I
didn't deserve to be here.

13:47.227 --> 13:48.996
It's like
she channeled my mother.

13:49.029 --> 13:50.998
Oh, BT-Dubbs,
your mother called.

13:51.031 --> 13:53.166
- Yeah, how long?
- 15 seconds.

13:53.200 --> 13:54.467
She said she was wondering

13:54.501 --> 13:56.469
if you had any potentials yet.

13:56.503 --> 13:59.172
- For the gymnastics team?
- Husbands.

13:59.206 --> 14:02.342
Oh, and she wanted
to remind you to,

14:02.375 --> 14:05.278
"get off your duff
and find a boyfriend already."

14:11.451 --> 14:13.420
- Stakeout training?
- Yep.

14:13.453 --> 14:16.356
I need to practice being
statue still for hours on end.

14:17.457 --> 14:20.160
My roommate in the CIA.

14:20.193 --> 14:21.528
Oh, speaking of which.

14:21.561 --> 14:23.230
Greene students are busy.

14:23.263 --> 14:25.298
I think you should do
what the CIA does...

14:25.332 --> 14:27.200
Kill people.

14:27.234 --> 14:29.336
No, you lunatic.

14:29.369 --> 14:32.339
When they can't find an
agent they make one.

14:32.372 --> 14:35.075
I don't know anyone in robotics.

14:35.108 --> 14:37.477
No, like, ah...
[Growls]

14:37.510 --> 14:40.580
Find people with
gymnastics-like skills.

14:40.613 --> 14:44.284
[Gasps] And then turn
them into gymnasts

14:44.317 --> 14:46.153
and make the team irresistible.

14:46.186 --> 14:47.487
Exactly.

14:47.520 --> 14:50.190
[Gasps]
Like a secret society.

14:50.223 --> 14:52.192
Ooh, that's even better.

14:52.225 --> 14:54.527
I'll call it
"the skulls."

14:54.561 --> 14:56.063
I think that's already taken.

14:56.096 --> 14:57.397
Fine.

14:57.430 --> 14:59.699
"The skills."

14:59.732 --> 15:01.568
Mm.

15:01.601 --> 15:03.971
There you go.

15:06.339 --> 15:07.941
Goggles.

15:10.543 --> 15:11.979
- [Clicks] Electrical humming]

15:21.688 --> 15:24.224
Cali, really? People
are starting to stare.

15:24.257 --> 15:26.093
- Rugby guys?
- Yeah.

15:26.126 --> 15:28.528
I gotta see who's left
to make sure you'll have a team.

15:28.561 --> 15:31.298
They'll all come back
once our team is formed.

15:31.331 --> 15:33.533
- Are you sure?
- Yes. All right.

15:33.566 --> 15:36.536
Angelina Rubens former
cirque Du Soleil performer.

15:36.569 --> 15:38.705
She took off after high
school for two years

15:38.738 --> 15:41.208
- to join Librecon.
- No.

15:41.241 --> 15:42.542
Let's get her.

15:42.575 --> 15:44.577
[Clicks]

15:44.611 --> 15:47.580
[Lowers voice] Angelina, you
have been requested to join

15:47.614 --> 15:49.416
"the skills,"

15:49.449 --> 15:51.384
skills, skill, skills.

15:51.418 --> 15:53.553
Follow the instructions
on the tombstone

15:53.586 --> 15:55.122
outside your door.

15:55.155 --> 15:56.990
Door, door, door.

15:59.192 --> 16:01.028
- Got it.
- [Laughing]

16:01.061 --> 16:04.164
High-five.

16:04.197 --> 16:05.465
[Apple]
Next is cashew.

16:05.498 --> 16:07.167
A junior and a surfer girl.

16:07.200 --> 16:10.137
- Ooh, good balance.
- Mm-hmm, exactly.

16:10.170 --> 16:11.604
Cashew is her
native-American name

16:11.638 --> 16:13.740
because they say
she's a refined nut.

16:17.544 --> 16:19.012
And of course, Emily,

16:19.046 --> 16:20.747
a two-time
national diver

16:20.780 --> 16:22.715
and she did gymnastics
when she was little.

16:22.749 --> 16:25.518
She made the JV rather than the
varsity team this year though.

16:25.552 --> 16:27.687
- So she quit.
- [Both chuckle]

16:27.720 --> 16:29.689
Ever since didn't get to flip.

16:31.724 --> 16:33.393
I've got Rebecca Moore.

16:33.426 --> 16:36.529
An avid snow ski jumper,
goes by Becky.

16:36.563 --> 16:38.398
Oh, I heard she almost made it

16:38.431 --> 16:40.067
to the winter Olympics.

16:40.100 --> 16:41.768
That is until her family
moved to Florida.

16:41.801 --> 16:43.303
[Groans]

16:43.336 --> 16:45.305
Hmm.
Courtney Castellanos.

16:45.338 --> 16:47.174
A real gymnast.

16:47.207 --> 16:49.509
The only one we didn't find
in our first search.

16:49.542 --> 16:51.678
She's been out of the sport
for three years now,

16:51.711 --> 16:53.713
but claims to be avidly pursuing

16:53.746 --> 16:55.715
rhythmic gymnastics.

16:55.748 --> 16:58.085
Perfect.

16:58.118 --> 17:00.253
- My precious.
- Oh.

17:00.287 --> 17:03.090
Sorry.
She's just so perfect.

17:04.257 --> 17:06.226
Let's get the rest.

17:06.259 --> 17:08.494
[Music playing]

17:58.511 --> 17:59.812
40 transfers.

17:59.846 --> 18:02.349
40 transfers!

18:02.382 --> 18:03.716
I know, but in our defense,

18:03.750 --> 18:05.352
only one actually transferred

18:05.385 --> 18:06.686
the rest we calmed down.

18:06.719 --> 18:08.388
From Greene to brown just...

18:08.421 --> 18:10.190
- [Apple laughs]
- It's not funny, apple.

18:10.223 --> 18:11.663
- Kind of...
- It's not funny, apple.

18:11.691 --> 18:13.460
- Greene to brown.
- Oh, boy...

18:13.493 --> 18:15.362
I could go for
a freezie pop right now.

18:15.395 --> 18:17.530
- Can I ask about that?
- Yeah, I used to smoke,

18:17.564 --> 18:19.399
and the freezie pops
calm me down.

18:19.432 --> 18:21.568
- Does it always work?
- Do I have a freezie pop?

18:21.601 --> 18:24.404
Am I calm?
No!

18:24.437 --> 18:27.174
- You don't care about me.
- Preston, I care.

18:27.207 --> 18:29.342
It's Mr. Kelly.

18:29.376 --> 18:30.843
I care.

18:30.877 --> 18:32.845
[Cali] So he's not
totally on board.

18:32.879 --> 18:35.882
No, no, but we must move on.

18:35.915 --> 18:38.751
Meet the team,
and establish eligibility.

18:38.785 --> 18:40.620
- All right.
- [Laughs]

18:40.653 --> 18:42.155
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

18:42.189 --> 18:44.157
- Whoa.
- Oh.

18:44.191 --> 18:46.459
- I have a boyfriend.
- Didn't ask you that.

18:46.493 --> 18:48.161
I love Todd.

18:48.195 --> 18:49.829
Am I on a secret quiz
show or is there...

18:49.862 --> 18:51.531
[Laughs nervously]

18:51.564 --> 18:53.700
No, oh, crazy town.

18:53.733 --> 18:56.403
Must be like
oxygen depletion, right?

18:56.436 --> 18:59.239
[Exhales]
I am totally okay now.

18:59.272 --> 19:01.241
Yeah, no, you totally look it.

19:01.274 --> 19:02.575
- Hi.
- Hi.

19:02.609 --> 19:04.577
- Apple Mccreighton-hill.
- We've met.

19:04.611 --> 19:06.446
Uh, when you wouldn't
look at my paper.

19:06.479 --> 19:07.914
My name is Chet.

19:07.947 --> 19:09.916
- You're in Todd's frat?
- Yeah.

19:09.949 --> 19:11.951
And on the rugby team?

19:11.984 --> 19:13.486
Yeah.

19:13.520 --> 19:15.488
Okay.
Well, I've got to go.

19:15.522 --> 19:19.726
Okay, um, well,
I'll see you around.

19:19.759 --> 19:22.262
Okay.
Ahem! Ahem!

19:22.295 --> 19:24.264
I think I'm gonna be sick.

19:24.297 --> 19:25.932
So you have the hots for him.

19:25.965 --> 19:27.467
What?
No, I don't.

19:27.500 --> 19:29.802
Yes, you do, but it's okay.

19:29.836 --> 19:31.804
I have been spying on
the rugby team,

19:31.838 --> 19:33.740
and he's trying to get
the team together.

19:35.408 --> 19:37.877
Todd. My boyfriend
and future husband

19:37.910 --> 19:40.913
who is hot and perfect.

19:40.947 --> 19:42.349
Sure he is...

19:42.382 --> 19:44.584
- Let's meet our team.
- [Groans]

19:54.394 --> 19:57.230
Your next initiation test

19:57.264 --> 20:00.533
- to the skills...
- Skills, skills, skills.

20:00.567 --> 20:03.536
Athletic aptitude.

20:03.570 --> 20:06.739
- Titude, titude...
- Shh, shh, shh, shh.

20:08.408 --> 20:11.644
[Music playing]

20:13.913 --> 20:16.549
[Straining]

20:18.585 --> 20:19.686
Ugh!

20:21.921 --> 20:22.921
Ugh!

20:26.726 --> 20:27.760
Ugh!

20:29.296 --> 20:30.430
Ahh!

20:33.433 --> 20:36.769
Yeah, I think we have
something to work with.

20:36.803 --> 20:38.638
Yeah.

20:38.671 --> 20:41.641
- Uh, Courtney?
- Yes.

20:41.674 --> 20:43.710
You still have
all your real gymnastics, right?

20:43.743 --> 20:46.045
Oh, yes, but,
I'm a rhythmic gymnast now.

20:46.078 --> 20:47.914
Oh, come on.

20:47.947 --> 20:49.616
If ribbons are used in the event

20:49.649 --> 20:52.519
and weird bowling pins,
then it's not a sport.

20:52.552 --> 20:53.853
It's a circus act.

20:53.886 --> 20:55.722
Hey, don't insult my craft.

20:55.755 --> 20:57.890
- What's your problem?
- Hey, hey.

20:57.924 --> 21:00.293
She said circus
not cirque Du Soleil.

21:00.327 --> 21:02.929
Yeah, well, she better be talking
about the Ringling brothers.

21:02.962 --> 21:04.997
- What's your deal?
- What's your deal?

21:06.766 --> 21:08.868
This is an epic disaster.

21:08.901 --> 21:10.770
It could be worse.

21:10.803 --> 21:13.806
[Overlapping shouting]

21:13.840 --> 21:15.342
Ugh.

21:15.375 --> 21:16.609
Or not.

21:24.517 --> 21:26.819
- Where is everyone?
- I don't know.

21:26.853 --> 21:29.689
The, uh, professor
didn't show up or something.

21:29.722 --> 21:32.792
- What?
- [Chet] All right.

21:32.825 --> 21:37.029
Well, good morning, econ 463.

21:37.063 --> 21:40.400
Based on a couple of observations
that you may have made already,

21:40.433 --> 21:43.570
uh, I have hair.
I am dressed nicely.

21:43.603 --> 21:47.740
No orthopedic shoes,
and I smell amazing.

21:47.774 --> 21:49.909
I am not actually
professor Kelly.

21:49.942 --> 21:51.844
My name is Chet,
and I'm actually your ta.

21:51.878 --> 21:53.112
It's a pleasure to meet you.

21:53.145 --> 21:54.847
But the professor
sent me here today

21:54.881 --> 21:57.083
to explain to
everybody that, uh,

21:57.116 --> 21:58.985
he's not actually
going to be teaching

21:59.018 --> 22:00.987
and that is because,
uh, he was given

22:01.020 --> 22:03.523
a pretty substantial Grant

22:03.556 --> 22:05.858
for his research on the, uh,

22:05.892 --> 22:08.828
economic correlation
between truck sales

22:08.861 --> 22:10.597
and people who like
country music.

22:10.630 --> 22:12.465
Which is super thrilling.

22:12.499 --> 22:14.667
But I'm pretty sure
it's just because his daughter

22:14.701 --> 22:16.903
transferred to brown... shh...
Didn't hear it from me.

22:16.936 --> 22:19.506
No big deal. Um, but,
guys, nevertheless,

22:19.539 --> 22:22.775
I am actually gonna be teaching
this class this semester.

22:25.878 --> 22:27.814
Mom, you'll never believe it.

22:27.847 --> 22:30.783
I found six girls to be on
the women's gymnastics team.

22:30.817 --> 22:32.952
All I have to do is convince
the athletic director...

22:32.985 --> 22:34.454
[mom]
How's the search going?

22:34.487 --> 22:35.955
Yeah, that's what
I'm telling you.

22:35.988 --> 22:38.525
Todd will be coming back
once we establish eligibility.

22:38.558 --> 22:40.393
[Mom] I heard your
econ class petered

22:40.427 --> 22:41.894
because the professor left.

22:41.928 --> 22:44.063
Do you want to trade
to a business class?

22:44.096 --> 22:45.932
- No, I...
- I say,

22:45.965 --> 22:47.767
stay on those business majors.

22:47.800 --> 22:49.636
Make dad and me proud.

22:49.669 --> 22:51.638
[Phone beeps]

22:51.671 --> 22:52.739
[Groans]

22:56.876 --> 22:58.044
[Apple]
I don't understand.

22:58.077 --> 22:59.479
We've done all the work.

22:59.512 --> 23:01.047
All he has to do
is approve the team.

23:01.080 --> 23:03.516
I haven't even
asked for funding.

23:03.550 --> 23:05.818
Maybe that's what
the problem is.

23:05.852 --> 23:07.153
Nicely done, George.

23:07.186 --> 23:08.521
Thanks.

23:09.989 --> 23:11.924
What do you mean,
that's the problem?

23:11.958 --> 23:13.493
Well, studies have shown

23:13.526 --> 23:15.061
that people
don't value things as much

23:15.094 --> 23:16.463
if they don't pay for them.

23:23.836 --> 23:25.137
Thus, if you agree to give us

23:25.171 --> 23:27.206
just three percent
of all athletic funds,

23:27.239 --> 23:29.141
we can afford all of this.

23:29.175 --> 23:32.178
- Such as these. -Yeah, caught
it when you walked in.

23:32.211 --> 23:34.180
And, it looks as though

23:34.213 --> 23:36.182
you've been receiving
from the university

23:36.215 --> 23:39.619
for a women's team that hasn't
existed for nine years.

23:39.652 --> 23:41.621
So, if you agree

23:41.654 --> 23:42.955
to the women's gymnastics team,

23:42.989 --> 23:45.091
then the NCAA
never has to find out

23:45.124 --> 23:47.193
about those missing funds.

23:47.226 --> 23:49.529
Sounds like you're trying
to blackmail me.

23:49.562 --> 23:52.532
No, no, no, no, no,
I'm just saying,

23:52.565 --> 23:55.034
you let me create
the women's gymnastic team

23:55.067 --> 23:57.570
and the NCAA
never has to find out.

23:57.604 --> 23:59.772
Okay, that's exactly
what blackmail is.

23:59.806 --> 24:01.073
So it's a yes?

24:01.107 --> 24:02.842
Did you hack into
the accounting fund?

24:02.875 --> 24:04.644
- Ugh! Preston...
- Mr. Kelly.

24:04.677 --> 24:06.078
I prefer the term
"perused."

24:06.112 --> 24:07.914
So, I will send
the documentation here...

24:07.947 --> 24:10.082
Okay, wait a sec, wait a second.

24:10.116 --> 24:11.784
You're lucky

24:11.818 --> 24:13.620
that I haven't
reported you to the Dean,

24:13.653 --> 24:15.163
much less, the police,
for hacking into

24:15.187 --> 24:17.123
the private files
of the university.

24:17.156 --> 24:19.826
They won't find any virtual evidence.
I covered my tracks.

24:19.859 --> 24:21.528
You're not listening.

24:21.561 --> 24:22.862
You're lucky that your parents

24:22.895 --> 24:24.263
are the number one
book providers

24:24.296 --> 24:25.765
for this university,

24:25.798 --> 24:27.734
otherwise, I would have
stopped this whole

24:27.767 --> 24:30.136
gymnastics team charade
a long time ago.

24:30.169 --> 24:32.772
Now let's also not forget
that your sorority

24:32.805 --> 24:34.907
and their little
paper grading business...

24:34.941 --> 24:36.509
Enlightened tutoring.

24:36.543 --> 24:39.512
This is the athletic
department at Greene.

24:39.546 --> 24:41.514
Fine.
I'll quit.

24:41.548 --> 24:43.850
It's what everyone
expects me to do anyway.

24:43.883 --> 24:46.786
Just ride on my parents
coattails and all that.

24:46.819 --> 24:48.287
I can do more than that.

24:48.320 --> 24:50.289
Yeah, this gymnastics team,

24:50.322 --> 24:52.291
they may be terrible,

24:52.324 --> 24:54.794
but it could've saved
your rugby team.

24:54.827 --> 24:56.563
You're not listening, apple.

24:56.596 --> 24:59.699
This is the athletic
department at Greene.

24:59.732 --> 25:01.701
One of the most
prestigious academic

25:01.734 --> 25:03.202
universities in the country.

25:03.235 --> 25:05.705
Which means, they don't
care about athletics.

25:05.738 --> 25:08.007
No one cares.

25:08.040 --> 25:11.177
I get no funding or support
from the university.

25:11.210 --> 25:13.546
I don't get any scholarships.

25:13.580 --> 25:15.548
I mean, I'm lucky to stay afloat

25:15.582 --> 25:17.049
with the alumni donations.

25:17.083 --> 25:19.151
I mean, I guess I owe it
to the student athletes

25:19.185 --> 25:20.587
to at least try.

25:20.620 --> 25:21.954
I mean, playing rugby here

25:21.988 --> 25:23.756
was some of the best times
of my life.

25:23.790 --> 25:25.692
You played rugby?

25:25.725 --> 25:27.894
- All, all that hacking...
- Internal searching.

25:27.927 --> 25:29.962
And you didn't run across that?

25:29.996 --> 25:31.330
The president of the university

25:31.363 --> 25:35.201
is bent out of shape
because of this whole

25:35.234 --> 25:37.336
athletic gender discrepancy.

25:37.369 --> 25:39.205
He wants me to fix it pronto,

25:39.238 --> 25:41.040
but, he's giving me no funding.

25:41.073 --> 25:42.575
[Gasps]

25:42.609 --> 25:44.010
Stop.

25:47.013 --> 25:48.981
I need to sign off
on everything.

25:49.015 --> 25:50.617
I mean, everything.

25:50.650 --> 25:52.585
And they'll be no

25:52.619 --> 25:55.588
hacking or deceit or lying.

25:55.622 --> 25:58.157
- Oh, I never lie.
- Yes, you do.

25:58.190 --> 26:00.092
And if that happens,

26:00.126 --> 26:01.794
I will create a volleyball team

26:01.828 --> 26:03.663
faster than
you can say tarred...

26:03.696 --> 26:05.331
And feathered.

26:05.364 --> 26:07.734
You have very outdated
forms of punishment.

26:07.767 --> 26:09.368
Okay, it's just a saying.
It's not...

26:09.401 --> 26:12.204
You are not gonna regret this.

26:12.238 --> 26:14.040
We're gonna work
so we'll together, Preston.

26:14.073 --> 26:15.775
May I call you Preston now?

26:15.808 --> 26:18.377
- It's still no.
- [Laughing] You're the best.

26:18.410 --> 26:20.747
You're the...

26:20.780 --> 26:23.916
Oh, my god.
Oh!

26:25.985 --> 26:28.821
[Laughing]

26:28.855 --> 26:31.157
- Oh!
- You okay?

26:31.190 --> 26:33.092
Oh, heavens.
Lightheaded.

26:33.125 --> 26:34.827
Do you always
meet people like this?

26:34.861 --> 26:36.896
Oh... Just you.

26:36.929 --> 26:38.998
That means I'm pretty
special, I think, right?

26:39.031 --> 26:41.233
Or just the wrong place
at the wrong time.

26:41.267 --> 26:44.804
Or maybe I'm at the right
place at the right time.

26:44.837 --> 26:46.372
And that's a great outfit,
by the way.

26:46.405 --> 26:47.674
You look, you look great.

26:47.707 --> 26:49.108
Oh, gosh.

26:55.815 --> 26:57.116
Oh.

26:57.149 --> 26:59.051
I've got to call Todd.

26:59.085 --> 27:01.220
Hey, can I try something on you?

27:01.253 --> 27:03.089
Uh, nope.
Those new?

27:03.122 --> 27:04.791
I bought them
for the CIA interview.

27:04.824 --> 27:06.225
I'm trying to break them in.

27:06.258 --> 27:08.861
- Here, let me just...
- Oh, no thank you.

27:11.463 --> 27:13.065
[Phone ringing]

27:17.403 --> 27:20.272
- What's up, apple?
- Todd, I've don't it.

27:20.306 --> 27:21.741
You can come back.

27:21.774 --> 27:23.209
The rugby team
is being reinstated.

27:23.242 --> 27:24.677
I built the gymnastics team.

27:24.711 --> 27:25.912
Mr. Kelly just called.

27:25.945 --> 27:27.413
He told me he got the team back.

27:27.446 --> 27:29.348
What? No, he didn't. I did.

27:29.381 --> 27:31.117
My flight's in two weeks.

27:31.150 --> 27:33.219
My dad wants me to stay
here and play in a game

27:33.252 --> 27:34.353
for some, uh,

27:34.386 --> 27:35.788
some international exposure.

27:35.822 --> 27:37.890
Two weeks?
That like forever.

27:37.924 --> 27:41.160
I know.
These Brits are so dry.

27:41.193 --> 27:43.129
Except for you.

27:43.162 --> 27:44.931
Well, can't you
come back any earlier?

27:44.964 --> 27:47.299
I really want you to meet
the gymnastics team.

27:47.333 --> 27:49.836
Nope, I got to go.
I'm a little busy here.

27:49.869 --> 27:51.370
Cheerio.

27:51.403 --> 27:53.305
[Groans]

27:58.010 --> 27:59.478
Well done...

27:59.511 --> 28:00.980
Well done.

28:13.993 --> 28:16.295
- [Knocking on door]
- Oh, please, come in.

28:16.328 --> 28:17.830
Please, please, come in.

28:17.864 --> 28:19.832
Cashew, my phone died,

28:19.866 --> 28:22.769
and I was not about to walk
across campus with this.

28:22.802 --> 28:24.203
[Laughs]

28:24.236 --> 28:25.237
Duh.

28:26.806 --> 28:28.207
Oh.

28:32.812 --> 28:35.381
Actually, could I try it
as a bracelet?

28:35.414 --> 28:37.817
Whatever.
Come with me.

28:37.850 --> 28:39.886
Can I change?

28:49.161 --> 28:50.863
We know what's going on here.

28:50.897 --> 28:53.800
We know we're not part
of your "secret" society.

28:53.833 --> 28:56.168
You're just starting
a gymnastics team.

28:56.202 --> 28:58.237
These are all Alpha females.

28:58.270 --> 29:00.106
At Greene?

29:00.139 --> 29:02.441
Who did you think you were
pulling a fast one on, apple?

29:02.474 --> 29:04.410
Yeah, and all this
to get your boyfriend back.

29:04.443 --> 29:05.845
How did you know that part?

29:05.878 --> 29:07.422
- It's not gonna cut it.
- I have missed

29:07.446 --> 29:10.216
7.59 hours
of studying for this.

29:10.249 --> 29:12.418
Yeah, and I missed
a cake tasting appointment.

29:12.451 --> 29:14.420
[Gasps]
Oh, my.

29:14.453 --> 29:15.955
Okay, okay, you're right.

29:15.988 --> 29:18.958
But, actually,
we are a secret society

29:18.991 --> 29:21.861
- in that nobody knows anything
about this team. -[Laughs]

29:21.894 --> 29:25.097
Nobody at Greene knows
about any athletic team.

29:25.131 --> 29:27.033
All right, I get it.
You're all angry at me

29:27.066 --> 29:28.434
because I made you
feel important

29:28.467 --> 29:30.002
and then you found out
you weren't.

29:30.036 --> 29:31.370
[Groaning]

29:31.403 --> 29:33.139
No, no, not that you
aren't important,

29:33.172 --> 29:34.473
you're just not important enough

29:34.506 --> 29:36.142
to be part
of a real secret society.

29:36.175 --> 29:37.443
- Ugh.
- You...

29:37.476 --> 29:39.812
But you are important.

29:39.846 --> 29:41.213
You are important
enough to start

29:41.247 --> 29:43.082
the first women's
gymnastics team

29:43.115 --> 29:44.383
at Greene university.

29:45.985 --> 29:47.186
Okay, look, we all came here

29:47.219 --> 29:48.855
to do something great, right?

29:48.888 --> 29:51.190
Angelina wants to be
a professor like her father.

29:51.223 --> 29:53.592
Cashew wants to run
for president.

29:53.625 --> 29:55.127
[Clicks tongue]

29:55.161 --> 29:57.396
Emily wants to go to med school.

29:57.429 --> 29:59.298
I don't get it,
but it's awesome.

29:59.331 --> 30:01.300
Courtney is gonna start
her own line

30:01.333 --> 30:03.169
of organic clothing.

30:03.202 --> 30:06.038
And I am going to marry
the finest rugby player

30:06.072 --> 30:08.374
that Greene has ever seen.

30:08.407 --> 30:10.276
Oh, and Becky.
Becky.

30:10.309 --> 30:11.944
Becky just wants to graduate.

30:11.978 --> 30:14.146
And in her 16th year
of research,

30:14.180 --> 30:16.348
she might just finish
that thesis.

30:16.382 --> 30:18.918
And I know all this
because I did my research.

30:18.951 --> 30:20.853
I chose you.

30:20.887 --> 30:22.454
You're completely
underappreciated

30:22.488 --> 30:24.023
in a sea of excellence

30:24.056 --> 30:25.925
with students
that are just as good as you

30:25.958 --> 30:27.493
and just as smart as you.

30:27.526 --> 30:30.029
No other student at Greene
can be a gymnast.

30:30.062 --> 30:32.999
Try me.
I looked, woo.

30:33.032 --> 30:35.067
But this is where
you make your mark.

30:35.101 --> 30:36.903
This is where you stand out.

30:36.936 --> 30:38.637
Some will tell their children

30:38.670 --> 30:40.272
that they graduated from Greene,

30:40.306 --> 30:42.008
and that's huge.

30:42.041 --> 30:44.476
But you will tell your children

30:44.510 --> 30:46.112
that you created the first

30:46.145 --> 30:48.480
women's gymnastics team

30:48.514 --> 30:51.918
- at Greene university.
- [Claps]

30:51.951 --> 30:53.886
That was unnecessary.

30:53.920 --> 30:56.889
You didn't have to go all
"sea of excellence" on us.

30:56.923 --> 30:58.490
We want to be part
of this team, apple.

30:58.524 --> 31:00.259
Oh, thank goodness.

31:00.292 --> 31:02.261
But if we're gonna do this...

31:02.294 --> 31:04.130
- We want to be good.
- Good?

31:04.163 --> 31:05.564
No, no, we want to be great..

31:05.597 --> 31:07.934
Otherwise, we're outta here.

31:07.967 --> 31:09.568
Bye-bye, rugby team.

31:09.601 --> 31:11.437
- Bye-bye, Todd.
- But, have you...

31:11.470 --> 31:13.605
Have you see us?
'Cause we're terrible.

31:13.639 --> 31:15.541
What'll it be?

31:20.046 --> 31:21.413
[Apple]
They want to be good,

31:21.447 --> 31:23.415
not level three good,
which is attainable

31:23.449 --> 31:26.285
with our NCAA approved
20 hours a week.

31:26.318 --> 31:29.188
Olympic good. Do you
know what that takes?

31:29.221 --> 31:31.057
I said you can start
a gymnastics team

31:31.090 --> 31:33.059
not invade my office
whenever you feel like it.

31:33.092 --> 31:34.393
Eight hours a day,

31:34.426 --> 31:37.263
that's what it takes,
for 14 years.

31:37.296 --> 31:39.265
Intermix that
with classes and studying,

31:39.298 --> 31:40.599
much less sleeping.

31:40.632 --> 31:42.168
And I need a 60 hour day.

31:42.201 --> 31:44.503
Can you give me
a 60 hour day, Preston?

31:44.536 --> 31:46.072
- Mr. Kelly.
- [Sighs heavily]

31:46.105 --> 31:47.974
The physics department
is working on a way

31:48.007 --> 31:50.542
- to slow down the earths rotation.
- Well, not fast enough!

31:50.576 --> 31:52.578
- Yeah, that's not a real thing.
- Oh, Preston!

31:52.611 --> 31:53.912
You are no help.

31:56.182 --> 31:58.217
It's Mr. Kelly.
Hmm.

31:58.250 --> 32:00.086
Beautiful.
All right, uh,

32:00.119 --> 32:02.288
that looks like it's all the
time we have for today.

32:02.321 --> 32:04.156
And, hey, guys, look,
do not forget to do

32:04.190 --> 32:05.524
the online problems, all right?

32:05.557 --> 32:08.027
It's 20 percent
of your overall grade.

32:08.060 --> 32:09.628
Have a great afternoon.

32:22.074 --> 32:24.410
I finished the online problems
for the entire semester

32:24.443 --> 32:26.212
three weeks ago.

32:26.245 --> 32:29.715
All right, apple,
then I wasn't talking to you.

32:29.748 --> 32:31.483
How about the, uh, the readings?

32:31.517 --> 32:33.352
You need any help with those?

32:33.385 --> 32:35.254
My parents published the books.

32:35.287 --> 32:36.588
Yes, that's right.

32:36.622 --> 32:38.590
You are Mccreighton-hill.

32:38.624 --> 32:41.527
The girl who got into Greene
because of her parents.

32:43.395 --> 32:45.697
But you know what?
I, uh, I don't buy that.

32:47.399 --> 32:49.101
Everyone else does.

32:49.135 --> 32:51.103
Well then, they're not
paying attention.

32:51.137 --> 32:53.005
'Cause the girl who's
been running into me

32:53.039 --> 32:54.773
for the past couple of weeks...

32:54.806 --> 32:56.408
She's on a mission.

33:01.347 --> 33:04.316
- What is that?
- My mission.

33:04.350 --> 33:05.684
Isn't that your gymnastics team

33:05.717 --> 33:07.319
- on greentube?
- Mm-hmm.

33:07.353 --> 33:10.022
I hacked it...
I stumbled into it.

33:10.056 --> 33:11.557
Greentube will now broadcast

33:11.590 --> 33:14.326
all gymnastics competitions.

33:14.360 --> 33:16.495
Impressive.
But isn't that for like,

33:16.528 --> 33:18.164
uh, students
to do work and stuff?

33:18.197 --> 33:19.431
Yeah, exactly.

33:19.465 --> 33:22.134
It'll establish our fan base.

33:22.168 --> 33:23.469
Only one problem.

33:23.502 --> 33:25.337
Uh, let me guess.

33:25.371 --> 33:27.673
There's gonna be a huge riot
when students realize

33:27.706 --> 33:29.741
that instead of their
lectures being on there,

33:29.775 --> 33:31.377
it's gonna be girls in spandex

33:31.410 --> 33:33.745
being tiny and flipping
and doing triple salchows.

33:33.779 --> 33:36.048
No. And salchows
are ice skating.

33:38.217 --> 33:40.486
I need to know
how to make our team great.

33:40.519 --> 33:42.788
Okay, so you came to me.

33:42.821 --> 33:45.491
Yeah, rugby was one
of the best teams on campus.

33:45.524 --> 33:47.059
They really listen to you.

33:47.093 --> 33:48.794
They treat you like a captain.

33:54.233 --> 33:56.635
Did I mention that I need
this to happen fast?

33:56.668 --> 33:59.105
'Cause our first competition
is in, like, two weeks.

33:59.138 --> 34:02.441
So...

34:02.474 --> 34:03.742
- Sure.
- Okay.

34:03.775 --> 34:05.277
[Both laughing]

34:05.311 --> 34:06.745
Okay, I thought
you were doing some

34:06.778 --> 34:08.647
weird Mr. Miyagi thing
my dad talks about.

34:08.679 --> 34:10.549
Yeah, no, I started
like a dramatic pause.

34:10.581 --> 34:12.251
- What is dramatic?
- It was annoying.

34:12.284 --> 34:13.418
Annoying?

34:13.452 --> 34:15.154
Well, I'm not helping you.

34:15.187 --> 34:16.822
I'm kidding.
Let's, uh, let's do it.

34:21.560 --> 34:23.695
Ooh, yes.
Cali, there you are.

34:23.728 --> 34:25.464
I've been looking
everywhere for you.

34:25.496 --> 34:26.774
I'm practicing maintaining focus

34:26.797 --> 34:28.534
while hanging upside down.

34:28.567 --> 34:30.702
What professor's conducting
an upside down exam?

34:30.735 --> 34:32.204
It's CIA interview prep.

34:32.237 --> 34:33.672
What if they hang me upside down

34:33.705 --> 34:35.341
and ask me a whole
bunch of questions?

34:35.373 --> 34:36.875
Or waterboard me?

34:36.908 --> 34:39.245
[Apple] I'm pretty sure
water boarding's illegal.

34:39.277 --> 34:40.446
In America.

34:40.478 --> 34:42.313
Not if they send me to Syria.

34:42.348 --> 34:44.315
[Sighs]

34:44.350 --> 34:46.518
Plus, it makes my cheeks rosier.

34:46.552 --> 34:48.219
- No blush?
- Nope.

34:48.254 --> 34:49.688
- Nice.
- [Both laugh]

34:49.721 --> 34:51.456
So I'm here
because I talked to Chet.

34:51.489 --> 34:53.259
Ah, hot rugby guy.

34:53.292 --> 34:55.594
Is he?

34:55.627 --> 34:57.596
Chet said the first
step to a great team

34:57.629 --> 34:59.765
- is a great coach.
- Well, I don't know anyone

34:59.798 --> 35:01.900
- who coaches gymnastics.
- Yeah, and neither do I.

35:01.933 --> 35:04.270
And I definitely don't
have time to find anyone.

35:04.303 --> 35:06.638
- What I need is a great motivator.
- Eh, don't we all?

35:06.672 --> 35:09.341
Cali, you're one of the most
motivated people I know.

35:09.375 --> 35:12.378
Yeah, but I have classes.
I have stakeout prep.

35:12.411 --> 35:14.380
I have CWP seminars.
I...

35:14.413 --> 35:17.383
And what's the one thing
you're missing?

35:17.416 --> 35:19.251
The new Lalucca bag?

35:19.285 --> 35:20.619
- Aren't we all?
- [Both chuckle]

35:22.288 --> 35:24.456
- What?
- Leadership.

35:25.891 --> 35:28.227
- Leadership?
- Mm-hmm.

35:28.260 --> 35:29.795
That's right, coach.

35:29.828 --> 35:32.498
The CIA wants leadership.

35:32.531 --> 35:34.533
- Huh.
- Let's talk.

35:34.566 --> 35:36.168
Oh.

35:53.719 --> 35:55.321
Lift that bag, apple!

35:58.624 --> 36:00.459
This is called
"CrossFit."

36:00.492 --> 36:03.562
Studies say it's the quickest
way to get in shape.

36:03.595 --> 36:05.597
We'll be pairing it
with your normal training

36:05.631 --> 36:07.799
to increase
your strength quickly.

36:11.270 --> 36:13.205
Come on, Courtney, quicker!

36:17.743 --> 36:18.844
Dining hall?

36:18.877 --> 36:20.546
- Yes.
- I'm starved.

36:20.579 --> 36:22.548
I'm so hungry
I could eat a horse.

36:22.581 --> 36:25.551
Hey, lean proteins and vegetables.
No equine.

36:25.584 --> 36:27.886
Ugh. She even dictates our food?

36:27.919 --> 36:29.521
Seriously?
Ugh!

36:32.358 --> 36:34.860
[Sighs]
Thanks.

36:34.893 --> 36:36.862
For what?

36:36.895 --> 36:39.565
- That was fun.
- Beating up on people?

36:39.598 --> 36:42.434
I'm pretty sure none of us are
gonna be able to walk tomorrow.

36:42.468 --> 36:45.671
Yeah, well, there's more
where that came from.

36:45.704 --> 36:47.406
You bedazzled my handcuffs?

36:47.439 --> 36:50.409
I'm sorry, but you
locked me to a chair.

36:50.442 --> 36:51.677
They're beautiful.

36:51.710 --> 36:54.313
Now they're my lucky handcuffs.

36:56.582 --> 36:58.884
Mm.

36:58.917 --> 37:00.586
What're you doing here?

37:00.619 --> 37:02.821
Don't you have
economics papers to grade?

37:02.854 --> 37:05.023
I absolutely do, I do, but, uh,

37:05.056 --> 37:07.393
I came to stretch
out a little bit,

37:07.426 --> 37:10.696
get a workout in,
maybe do some rings.

37:10.729 --> 37:12.698
How was your first practice?

37:12.731 --> 37:14.500
Uh, it was great.

37:14.533 --> 37:15.867
Cali is the perfect coach.

37:15.901 --> 37:17.536
She's punctual, sparkly,

37:17.569 --> 37:18.904
and mean as a badger.

37:18.937 --> 37:21.540
Ooh, sounds like
every coach I've ever had.

37:23.442 --> 37:25.711
What're you really doing here?

37:25.744 --> 37:27.879
I came to check on you.

37:27.913 --> 37:31.417
Plus, the existence of my team
depends on the success of yours.

37:31.450 --> 37:33.852
So, we're kinda
freaking out a little bit.

37:35.654 --> 37:37.323
I hold your future in my hands?

37:37.356 --> 37:40.826
Oh, my goodness!
That is, that's awful.

37:40.859 --> 37:42.694
That's really scary looking.

37:42.728 --> 37:44.696
Can I show you something?

37:44.730 --> 37:47.599
You can. I mean, we're in a,
a public facility

37:47.633 --> 37:49.000
and that might be inappropriate,

37:49.034 --> 37:50.702
- 'cause it's...
- On the bars, dimwit.

37:50.736 --> 37:51.870
Oh, right, uh, absolutely.

37:51.903 --> 37:53.772
Bars.
Love the bars.

37:53.805 --> 37:56.308
- Um, which, uh, ones are the bars?
- Oh, my gosh.

37:56.342 --> 37:58.944
You guys have
a hundred bars in here.

[Coughing]

38:41.987 --> 38:43.855
That's really good.

38:43.889 --> 38:46.358
I mean, right? That was,
that was really good, right?

38:46.392 --> 38:48.460
I mean, I know nothing,
but that looked amazing.

38:48.494 --> 38:50.396
Yes, yes,
that was a little bit good.

38:50.429 --> 38:52.798
Man, how did you, like,
how'd you learn to do that?

38:55.033 --> 38:56.868
So I did gymnastics
for ten years.

38:56.902 --> 38:59.405
I was level ten
by the time I was 12,

38:59.438 --> 39:01.072
a lead at 13,

39:01.106 --> 39:02.608
and then my parents work hours

39:02.641 --> 39:04.710
started to interfering
with practice.

39:04.743 --> 39:06.478
I knew they were
sending me to Greene

39:06.512 --> 39:08.046
where there is no gymnastics.

39:08.079 --> 39:09.748
Blah, blah, blah.

39:09.781 --> 39:12.918
And I quit.

39:12.951 --> 39:15.454
I guess that's why I care.

39:15.487 --> 39:17.823
When the girls told me
they wanted to be good,

39:17.856 --> 39:19.558
they reminded me
of what it felt like

39:19.591 --> 39:21.092
to want to be great
at something.

39:24.095 --> 39:26.064
You surprise me, apple.

39:26.097 --> 39:28.600
See, at first,
you seemed so girly

39:28.634 --> 39:31.069
and sparkly and flighty.

39:31.102 --> 39:33.405
Then you go and you get
everything right in econ,

39:33.439 --> 39:35.407
and then you go and do
something like that.

39:35.441 --> 39:36.808
It's...

39:36.842 --> 39:38.009
Not many people surprise me.

- Oh, okay?

39:45.551 --> 39:46.852
- Oh.
- Oh!

39:46.885 --> 39:48.554
Ah.
Are you okay?

39:48.587 --> 39:51.790
Yep, I'm okay.
Hey, Jeremy.

39:51.823 --> 39:54.660
Hey.
So...

39:54.693 --> 39:56.828
I hear Todd's coming back.

39:56.862 --> 39:58.830
You must be excited.

39:58.864 --> 40:02.167
Yep, Todd. Todd, Todd, Todd.
My boyfriend.

40:02.200 --> 40:04.870
My go-to guy.
My other half.

40:04.903 --> 40:07.038
Yep, so, I'm so excited.

40:07.072 --> 40:08.774
[Jeremy]
So...

40:08.807 --> 40:11.777
Uh, we have our first
sanctioned practice back, man.

40:11.810 --> 40:14.480
This gymnastics team
has been approved.

40:14.513 --> 40:15.981
Are you kidding me?

40:16.014 --> 40:17.849
[Both grunting]

40:17.883 --> 40:20.051
That's, that's...

40:20.085 --> 40:21.920
- So good.
- Ah!

40:21.953 --> 40:23.555
Ooh! Yes!

40:25.991 --> 40:27.092
[Thuds]

40:48.213 --> 40:49.881
All right, Angelina.

40:49.915 --> 40:51.750
- Ugh. -Make sure your
hands hit first.

40:51.783 --> 40:53.084
Okay.

40:53.118 --> 40:54.520
- Hey.
- You're late.

40:54.553 --> 40:56.154
I was grading papers.
We need to talk.

40:56.187 --> 40:58.590
- I so confused about Todd.
- 500 leg lifts.

40:58.624 --> 41:00.592
100 for every minute
you were late.

41:00.626 --> 41:03.161
- 500?
- Is that a lot?

41:03.194 --> 41:05.531
Yeah, to divide
between 40 people.

41:05.564 --> 41:06.932
Good.
Then I made my point.

41:06.965 --> 41:09.568
Don't ever be late
to my practice again.

41:09.601 --> 41:10.936
[Exhales deeply]

41:10.969 --> 41:13.572
- Good job, Angelina.
- Thanks. I was on time.

41:13.605 --> 41:15.106
Yes, you were.
Again.

41:15.140 --> 41:16.207
Okay.

41:17.843 --> 41:19.511
[Groans]

41:19.545 --> 41:20.779
Better?

41:25.216 --> 41:26.885
What did you do?

41:26.918 --> 41:29.888
I walked in eating a bag
of caramel corn.

41:29.921 --> 41:31.523
I thought corn was a vegetable.

41:31.557 --> 41:33.058
Yeah.

41:33.091 --> 41:35.761
- [Cali] Point your toes.
- [Angelina] They are pointed.

41:35.794 --> 41:37.763
Mm. Mm.

41:37.796 --> 41:39.765
[Chet laughing]
Dude, get out of here.

41:39.798 --> 41:41.933
Hey, come on, man.
I'm actually serious here.

41:41.967 --> 41:44.035
- Oh! Whoa!
- Oh.

41:44.069 --> 41:45.604
Ah, uh...

41:45.637 --> 41:47.873
- You two all right?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, um.

41:47.906 --> 41:50.876
- I'll meet up with you at the library
afterwards. -Yeah, of course.

41:50.909 --> 41:53.011
Okay, the library.

41:53.044 --> 41:55.180
- I'm okay.
- Ah, you're okay.

41:55.213 --> 41:57.549
Are you guys really going
to the library?

41:57.583 --> 41:59.885
Because it's that way.

41:59.918 --> 42:01.219
Ah, no, there's a,

42:01.252 --> 42:03.021
there's a new restaurant
that opened up

42:03.054 --> 42:04.255
called the library, downtown.

42:04.289 --> 42:05.824
Oh, right.

42:05.857 --> 42:07.793
Cali doesn't really
let us eat out anymore.

42:07.826 --> 42:09.094
- So...
- Right.

42:09.127 --> 42:10.862
I haven't been
downtown in a while.

42:10.896 --> 42:12.964
Uh, I mean, you could
come with us if you want.

42:12.998 --> 42:15.601
You might have to change
and put some shoes on.

42:15.634 --> 42:17.636
- But...
- Oh.

42:17.669 --> 42:19.304
I can't.

42:19.337 --> 42:20.939
I have to go
to the real library.

42:20.972 --> 42:22.774
- Okay.
- I'm pretty sure

42:22.808 --> 42:25.310
Cali has inserted surveillance
devices into our towels.

42:25.343 --> 42:27.112
Becky stayed up
past curfew last night

42:27.145 --> 42:28.714
watching
"lovely little lawyers,"

42:28.747 --> 42:30.081
and Cali woke her up
at 5:00 A.M.

42:30.115 --> 42:31.983
- For a discipline run.
- Ooh.

42:32.017 --> 42:34.620
- It sound pretty serious.
- Yeah, I've created a monster.

42:34.653 --> 42:36.087
Yeah.
Yeah.

42:38.890 --> 42:41.226
Yeah, well, you guys are
probably getting a lot better,

42:41.259 --> 42:43.261
- though, so...
- Yeah, we're actually decent.

42:43.294 --> 42:44.930
The first competition
is tomorrow.

42:44.963 --> 42:46.832
- Really?
- Yeah, it's more

42:46.865 --> 42:48.767
of a local scrimmage
with some club teams.

42:48.800 --> 42:51.269
- It's not a big deal.
- I'll totally be there.

42:54.072 --> 42:56.642
- About what happened...
- Apple, um, don't.

42:56.675 --> 42:58.143
It's, it's fine.
It's totally fine.

42:58.176 --> 43:00.311
Look, I know
Todd's your boyfriend.

43:00.345 --> 43:03.081
You've been saying it since the
first time you ran into me.

43:03.114 --> 43:05.784
Um, it's okay. I just, honestly,
though, I didn't really,

43:05.817 --> 43:07.653
didn't really think
it was that serious.

43:07.686 --> 43:09.988
But you're on the team with him.

43:10.021 --> 43:12.824
Yeah.

43:12.858 --> 43:14.960
Friends?

43:14.993 --> 43:16.662
Friends.

43:16.695 --> 43:18.329
Okay.

43:18.363 --> 43:20.732
Uh, I should probably get going.

43:20.766 --> 43:21.867
- So...
- Right. Right.

43:21.900 --> 43:23.669
- Have a good night.
- Okay.

43:24.836 --> 43:27.005
Uh, hey, apple.

43:27.038 --> 43:29.875
Good luck tomorrow.

43:29.908 --> 43:31.109
Thanks.

43:43.321 --> 43:47.693
[Spectators murmuring]

43:47.726 --> 43:48.727
Oh, my gosh. He's here.

43:48.760 --> 43:49.861
- Oh, apple.
- Apple!

43:49.895 --> 43:51.863
I'm sorry.
Sorry.

43:51.897 --> 43:53.398
What is wrong?
What happened?

43:53.431 --> 43:55.266
Let's focus.
Focus.

43:55.300 --> 43:58.236
[Chants in unison]
I g c, woo!

43:58.269 --> 44:00.772
All right, hands in, guys.

44:03.975 --> 44:05.443
All right, our first
event is bars.

44:05.476 --> 44:06.912
[All]
Okay.

44:06.945 --> 44:08.246
- You ready?
- Yes.

44:08.279 --> 44:10.381
[Girl] Let's get
ready to tumble!

44:10.415 --> 44:13.985
Move, please.
It's a 30 second touch.

44:14.019 --> 44:17.022
- Touch? What?
- What're we touching?

44:17.055 --> 44:19.324
The equipment.

44:22.761 --> 44:24.329
[All gasping]

44:25.897 --> 44:27.866
I coulda sworn
the said "rumble."

44:27.899 --> 44:29.367
Yeah, it sounded super similar.

44:29.400 --> 44:31.336
- I know, right?
- Okay, guys.

44:31.369 --> 44:33.705
I need you to change
into your competition Leos,

44:33.739 --> 44:35.106
and I'll meet you at the bars.

44:35.140 --> 44:37.142
- [All] Okay.
- Wait, I mean, the vault.

44:37.175 --> 44:40.045
- Ah, I hate vaults.
- Yes, come on, let's go.

44:40.078 --> 44:43.114
[Cheers, whistles, applause]

45:13.111 --> 45:14.512
[Crowd groans]

45:14.545 --> 45:18.449
Yeah, uh, yeah, yeah.

45:21.352 --> 45:22.353
Okay.

45:32.097 --> 45:33.865
Yeah!

45:38.804 --> 45:40.371
Is that good?

45:49.347 --> 45:51.016
[Crowd groans]

45:59.925 --> 46:01.860
[Cheers, whistles]

46:32.423 --> 46:33.558
[Angelina]
Man!

46:33.591 --> 46:35.093
Are you sure these other girls

46:35.126 --> 46:37.028
are just club teams?

46:41.867 --> 46:44.970
- Mm-hmm.
- Uh! Man!

46:59.017 --> 47:00.318
Though, it's not a total wash.

47:00.351 --> 47:03.855
Our average all around
was a 32.75.

47:03.889 --> 47:05.356
No one looks at averages.

47:05.390 --> 47:09.060
Our team score
was 183.5.

47:09.094 --> 47:10.929
That's enough.

47:10.962 --> 47:12.463
So, it was our first meet.

47:12.497 --> 47:14.399
We can't surrender
to mediocrity.

47:14.432 --> 47:16.267
Yes, we can.
We're terrible,

47:16.301 --> 47:18.169
and now we're only
fractionally terrible.

47:18.203 --> 47:19.470
That's a huge leap.

47:19.504 --> 47:21.339
Were they complacent?

47:21.372 --> 47:23.341
- Cali.
- Really?

47:23.374 --> 47:25.310
I am trying to watch
competition footage.

47:25.343 --> 47:27.312
- I need to focus.
- Fine.

47:27.345 --> 47:28.646
I should probably watch it, too.

47:28.679 --> 47:30.015
[Laughs]

47:30.048 --> 47:34.185
[Crowd cheering]

47:34.219 --> 47:35.653
[Apple] That's not
our competition.

47:35.686 --> 47:37.588
I know. It's the pro
gymnastics challenge.

47:37.622 --> 47:39.124
These girls are amazing.

47:39.157 --> 47:42.593
- It's a skill for skill...
- Face off.

47:42.627 --> 47:44.229
[Crowd cheering]

47:44.262 --> 47:48.199
- And only the strongest..
- Will survive.

47:48.233 --> 47:49.534
Did you know that there's life

47:49.567 --> 47:51.402
- after college gymnastics?
- Whoa.

47:51.436 --> 47:53.571
[Crowd cheering]

47:53.604 --> 47:55.941
- Oh, my...
- I know.

47:55.974 --> 47:58.944
So did you get
any of our competition?

47:58.977 --> 48:01.146
Oh, of course.

48:03.048 --> 48:05.016
Ellie, square your
hips on your layout.

48:05.050 --> 48:06.684
- Layout, okay?
- [Apple] Cali.

48:06.717 --> 48:09.554
You taped the coaching?

48:09.587 --> 48:11.422
This is my first
undercover assignment.

48:11.456 --> 48:13.291
I need to make sure
that I'm believable.

48:13.324 --> 48:15.426
- Ugh.
- [Knocking on door]

48:15.460 --> 48:17.695
- Oh, hi.
- Hey.

48:17.728 --> 48:19.564
Is this a bad time, girls?

48:19.597 --> 48:22.133
No, we're just
rehashing the meet.

48:22.167 --> 48:24.302
Hi. Well, you girls
were incredible.

48:24.335 --> 48:27.538
- Uh, really, really good.
- For a bunch of four-year-olds.

48:27.572 --> 48:30.575
Although I do wish that you came
into the stands afterwards,

48:30.608 --> 48:32.643
because I wanted
to give you these.

48:32.677 --> 48:34.345
- Um...
- You know,

48:34.379 --> 48:37.182
just for the next time
you run into me on campus.

48:37.215 --> 48:39.617
Or just like, generally for
your life, so you have shoes.

48:39.650 --> 48:40.952
[Laughs]

48:40.986 --> 48:43.388
Ow.
Leg lifts.

48:43.421 --> 48:46.457
Okay, it looks like everything's
coming along pretty good over here.

48:46.491 --> 48:48.093
[Gasps]
No, this is old.

48:48.126 --> 48:49.360
Oh, my gosh.
It's archaic.

48:49.394 --> 48:50.628
This silly board.
Oh, my gosh.

48:50.661 --> 48:52.297
I don't even know how that thing

48:52.330 --> 48:54.532
- was still up there.
- Yeah, it's a pretty big board.

48:54.565 --> 48:56.267
- I don't know.
- Okay.

48:56.301 --> 48:58.636
[Coach] Ellie, square your
hips on your layout, layout.

48:58.669 --> 49:01.306
Come on, Courtney. Square your
hips on your layout, layout.

49:01.339 --> 49:02.740
- Walk me to the library?
- Love to.

49:02.773 --> 49:04.509
- Right on cue.
- Don't you want to...

49:04.542 --> 49:05.576
- Put on some...
- Right.

49:05.610 --> 49:06.644
- Yeah.
- Shirt and shoes.

49:06.677 --> 49:08.046
- Yeah.
- In a moment.

49:09.580 --> 49:11.649
Well, you are going to be
the best dressed person

49:11.682 --> 49:13.184
in the library, hands down.

49:13.218 --> 49:14.695
- That's the goal.
- Honestly, though,

49:14.719 --> 49:16.254
you guys were incredible today.

49:16.287 --> 49:18.323
Hah, well, we achieved
one of my goals.

49:18.356 --> 49:20.158
- Which was what?
- No major injuries.

49:20.191 --> 49:21.993
[Laughs] Setting the
bar nice and high.

49:22.027 --> 49:24.029
- I like it.
- What's going on?

49:24.062 --> 49:25.463
- [Girl] Apple?
- Oh, come on.

49:25.496 --> 49:27.265
- What're you...
- [Girl] Apple, is that you?

49:27.298 --> 49:29.000
Oh, ho ho, thank goodness.

49:29.034 --> 49:31.002
Apple, it's only six
months till my wedding,

49:31.036 --> 49:32.570
and I'm running
a simple rehearsal,

49:32.603 --> 49:33.738
but Tanya had to bail on me

49:33.771 --> 49:35.373
because some
bridezilla was like,

49:35.406 --> 49:37.208
my invitations
are ivory and not mocha.

49:37.242 --> 49:39.344
And Sally and mark
are stuck in a study session.

49:39.377 --> 49:41.512
So, they were supposed to be
my bride and groom.

49:41.546 --> 49:43.081
So, come with me.
Come, come, come.

49:44.449 --> 49:46.417
Right this way.
Come, come, come.

49:46.451 --> 49:49.120
And, ta-da.

49:49.154 --> 49:51.456
You set this all up
after the competition?

49:51.489 --> 49:53.558
- Yep.
- Wow.

49:53.591 --> 49:55.560
It looks really beautiful,
but we actually

49:55.593 --> 49:57.562
- need to get to the library.
- Who's this?

49:57.595 --> 49:58.796
- Chet...
- Oh, great.

49:58.829 --> 50:00.565
I was so over Todd.

50:00.598 --> 50:02.067
Now, I'm gonna need you guys

50:02.100 --> 50:03.634
to start over here
and end over there.

50:03.668 --> 50:05.703
So, I'm gonna move throughout
just to make sure

50:05.736 --> 50:07.705
I can see everything, okay?
Wait right here.

50:07.738 --> 50:09.707
- I'm sorry.
- She seems lovely.

50:11.609 --> 50:13.144
Now, I have to have
all the chairs

50:13.178 --> 50:14.512
out of here by two,

50:14.545 --> 50:16.314
so, new boy,
you're gonna be my groom.

50:16.347 --> 50:17.482
Go.

50:17.515 --> 50:19.317
- Shall we?
- [Scoffs]

50:19.350 --> 50:21.686
And, three, two, one, march.

50:21.719 --> 50:23.521
[Apple] She's one of
my sorority sisters.

50:23.554 --> 50:24.755
[Emily]
A little slower.

50:24.789 --> 50:26.757
And I was there at her proposal.

50:26.791 --> 50:30.228
[Emily] Step together.
Step together.

50:30.261 --> 50:32.397
And I also know her
wedding planner, too.

50:32.430 --> 50:35.533
Give me more sway with your hips, apple.
I want sexy.

50:35.566 --> 50:37.568
It's fine. You don't
have to keep explaining.

50:37.602 --> 50:39.337
[Emily] No, no, no,
no, no, touching.

50:39.370 --> 50:41.339
Step together.
Step together.

50:41.372 --> 50:43.374
This is actually
what I had planned for today.

50:43.408 --> 50:45.310
- So, it works out.
- [Emily] Step together.

50:45.343 --> 50:47.312
And, stop.

50:48.746 --> 50:50.715
You look like you were gyrating.

50:50.748 --> 50:52.150
It, it's okay.

50:52.183 --> 50:55.253
[Students murmuring]

50:59.257 --> 51:00.791
[Emily]
Dearly beloved,

51:00.825 --> 51:03.228
we are gathered here today
to celebrate this couple

51:03.261 --> 51:05.730
- in holy matrimony?
- [Chuckles]

51:05.763 --> 51:07.632
Emily, do you take Chelsey...

51:07.665 --> 51:09.500
Named after his father.

51:09.534 --> 51:12.337
- Do you?
- I do.

51:12.370 --> 51:14.305
[Sighs]
Okay, good.

51:14.339 --> 51:17.175
And, Chelsey, do you take Emily?

51:17.208 --> 51:19.210
- I do.
- Oh, good.

51:19.244 --> 51:22.213
- Now, kiss.
- What?

51:22.247 --> 51:24.582
Well, I now pronounce you
man and wife.

51:24.615 --> 51:26.117
- Kiss.
- No, I can't.

51:27.818 --> 51:29.387
[Gasps]
Oh.

51:29.420 --> 51:31.389
- [Camera shutter clicks]
- Perfect.

51:31.422 --> 51:33.624
- [Crowd clapping] -[Emily
giggles] That's the shot.

51:33.658 --> 51:38.529
That is the front
of my photo album.

51:38.563 --> 51:39.697
Oh, my gosh.

51:39.730 --> 51:42.267
Bye-bye.

51:50.375 --> 51:52.843
Hi-yah!

51:52.877 --> 51:54.379
Ugh!

51:54.412 --> 51:56.714
[Both panting]

51:56.747 --> 51:59.217
Apple, what're you doing?

51:59.250 --> 52:02.287
- Woo! Nice one.
- Thanks.

52:02.320 --> 52:05.290
A little Kung Fu mixed with some parkour.
It's no biggie.

52:05.323 --> 52:07.625
- Here.
- Oh, no, I'm good.

52:07.658 --> 52:09.560
- I'm good.
- Okay.

52:11.596 --> 52:12.730
Why are you sweaty?

52:12.763 --> 52:14.599
I don't know.

52:14.632 --> 52:17.602
I must've gone, like, five miles.
It's all a blur.

52:17.635 --> 52:19.870
After I kissed Chet,
I just, I started running,

52:19.904 --> 52:21.672
and then I got lost,
and it was dark,

52:21.706 --> 52:23.208
and there was some frat people,

52:23.241 --> 52:24.642
and there were a lot
of people...

52:24.675 --> 52:26.644
- What?
- You kissed Chet?

52:28.313 --> 52:29.614
I kissed Chet.

52:29.647 --> 52:31.616
[Both screaming, giggling]

52:31.649 --> 52:33.184
What does that mean?

52:33.218 --> 52:34.485
Oh, I don't know!

52:34.519 --> 52:35.853
[Laughing, giggling]

52:35.886 --> 52:38.789
Yeah, that's awesome!
That's awesome!

52:44.595 --> 52:46.631
- Apple, no. -I think
I know what the...

52:46.664 --> 52:49.267
- I'm in a meeting. -I think
I know what the problem is.

52:49.300 --> 52:51.336
Hey, apple Mccreighton-hill.

52:51.369 --> 52:53.604
- Francesca.
- Pleasure.

52:53.638 --> 52:54.939
- Can you hold this?
- Oh.

52:54.972 --> 52:56.674
As, as much as
I've grown accustomed

52:56.707 --> 52:58.676
- to your, uh, overdone...
- Ornamented?

52:58.709 --> 53:00.378
Presentations,

53:00.411 --> 53:01.746
a simple email will suffice.

53:01.779 --> 53:03.281
- Preston.
- Mr. Kelly.

53:03.314 --> 53:04.682
We both know
that you're secretly

53:04.715 --> 53:06.217
rooting for the gymnastics team.

53:06.251 --> 53:07.418
If my secretly rooting

53:07.452 --> 53:09.254
meaning praying
that its very existence

53:09.287 --> 53:10.388
doesn't cost me my job?

53:10.421 --> 53:11.656
Then, yes, I am in a meeting.

53:11.689 --> 53:13.424
- I will be quick.
- Good-bye.

53:13.458 --> 53:15.526
Ugh! But this is where I
wow you with my ideas

53:15.560 --> 53:17.528
for competition gear
and new equipment.

53:17.562 --> 53:19.864
Actually, you know what?
Come here.

53:19.897 --> 53:22.800
How did you hack the greentube to
cover all the gymnastics meets?

53:22.833 --> 53:24.535
I know better
than to incriminate...

53:24.569 --> 53:26.671
Could you do the same thing
with the rugby meets?

53:26.704 --> 53:28.673
- Yeah, of course, but...
- Then do it.

53:28.706 --> 53:30.775
- Rugby, too?
- Just get out of here.

53:36.013 --> 53:37.382
Hey.

53:37.415 --> 53:39.016
I'm so nervous.

53:39.049 --> 53:41.686
Todd's flight doesn't get in
for another 20 minutes.

53:41.719 --> 53:43.288
[Sighs]

53:43.321 --> 53:45.022
We haven't seen each other
in over a month.

53:45.055 --> 53:46.624
Do you think
it's gonna be weird?

53:46.657 --> 53:48.393
No, you guys are gonna be fine.

53:48.426 --> 53:49.660
[Exhales]

53:52.029 --> 53:55.333
My personal statement
for the CIA application.

53:55.366 --> 53:57.268
What?
When did you finish it?

53:57.302 --> 53:58.669
Yesterday.

53:58.703 --> 54:00.838
Okay, be completely critical,
mark it up.

54:00.871 --> 54:02.540
- I need perfection.
- Absolutely.

54:02.573 --> 54:03.874
I will do my best work.

54:03.908 --> 54:06.043
[Laughing]

54:06.076 --> 54:07.745
I can't believe it's happening.

54:07.778 --> 54:10.281
I know. You're gonna
be in the CIA.

54:10.315 --> 54:12.583
And you're gonna get Todd.

54:12.617 --> 54:15.320
Did you say his flight
gets in in 20 minutes?

54:15.353 --> 54:18.423
- Yeah. -That is hardly
ample preparation time.

54:23.628 --> 54:24.929
Okay.

54:24.962 --> 54:26.931
[Knocking on door]
Oh, Todd.

54:26.964 --> 54:28.466
It is open.

54:28.499 --> 54:29.867
Hi.

54:31.969 --> 54:33.804
- Hey.
- Hey.

54:36.040 --> 54:38.943
- I was just...
- Looking for Todd?

54:38.976 --> 54:40.645
- Yeah.
- He's in the bathroom.

54:40.678 --> 54:42.747
He'll be out in, uh,
just a minute, I think.

54:45.015 --> 54:47.352
You guys live together?

54:47.385 --> 54:49.520
Yeah, uh, well,
when he left, uh,

54:49.554 --> 54:51.055
Jeremy moved in with Mike.

54:51.088 --> 54:53.491
So when he came back,
I was the only guy on the team

54:53.524 --> 54:54.759
who didn't have a roommate.

54:54.792 --> 54:56.627
Okay, so you guys
live together now.

54:56.661 --> 54:58.863
- Yeah.
- Does he know?

54:58.896 --> 55:01.466
Does he know what?

55:01.499 --> 55:04.735
Look, uh, why don't
you take a seat.

55:06.371 --> 55:08.673
He'll be out in a second,
and, uh...

55:08.706 --> 55:11.776
I'm sure you guys
have a lot to catch up on.

55:11.809 --> 55:13.411
I'll talk to you later.

55:16.481 --> 55:17.915
Yay.

55:22.387 --> 55:24.989
[Sports announcer] He's gonna
have to hurry, but it looks like

55:25.022 --> 55:26.857
he might just come up
a little bit short,

55:26.891 --> 55:29.527
but still...

55:29.560 --> 55:30.561
I missed you, babe.

55:30.595 --> 55:31.596
I missed you, too.

55:31.629 --> 55:33.531
I have an idea.

55:33.564 --> 55:36.401
You want to help me unpack
and organize my closet?

55:36.434 --> 55:38.869
Remember how you used to do it
with the color coordination?

55:38.903 --> 55:40.137
That rocked.

55:40.170 --> 55:42.707
Uh, the boxes
are right over there.

55:42.740 --> 55:45.142
- Thanks, babe.
- Okay.

55:45.175 --> 55:47.478
No one does it like you.

55:47.512 --> 55:49.414
There you go.

55:51.849 --> 55:53.451
Yeah, what...

55:59.056 --> 56:01.426
[Sports announcer]
And kudos to the crowd

56:01.459 --> 56:03.694
who are trying to bring him
across the finish line.

56:10.200 --> 56:12.703
[Panting]

56:12.737 --> 56:15.039
- Done.
- Good job, babe.

56:15.072 --> 56:16.907
Nice.

56:16.941 --> 56:19.444
Yeah, you brought back
a lot of clothes.

56:19.477 --> 56:21.679
But I was able to get them
all in once I figured out

56:21.712 --> 56:23.147
- the right folding system.
- Hmm.

56:23.180 --> 56:25.950
Oh, and you brought back this.

56:28.018 --> 56:29.987
I'm sure it just shrunk
in the wash, right?

56:30.020 --> 56:31.722
[Giggles, sighs]
Okay.

56:31.756 --> 56:33.991
I'm gonna get these down
to the laundry room.

56:35.926 --> 56:37.828
- Uh, apple.
- Huh?

56:43.734 --> 56:44.969
Come here.

56:50.708 --> 56:52.477

by five tenths.

Where is our fearless leader?

58:20.197 --> 58:22.166
Um...

58:23.868 --> 58:26.637

58:45.222 --> 58:47.224
- Wow.
- I know, right?

58:47.257 --> 58:49.126
At first I wasn't sure
about this sweater.

58:49.159 --> 58:50.561
And then I was, like,

58:50.595 --> 58:52.963
how could I live
without this sweater?

58:52.997 --> 58:55.833
Uh, I was referring
to the length.

58:55.866 --> 58:57.267
You missed practice again.

58:57.301 --> 58:59.236
Oh, yeah, woops.

58:59.269 --> 59:01.038
The meet is this weekend.

59:01.071 --> 59:03.874
- Yeah...
- Yeah?

59:03.908 --> 59:05.610
About that.

59:05.643 --> 59:07.812
You know how everyone told me
it was a stupid idea

59:07.845 --> 59:09.847
to build a gymnastics team
to win back a boy?

59:09.880 --> 59:12.717
- Well, I didn't. -Well, you
should have because it was.

59:12.750 --> 59:15.786
That was a pitiful attempt
to be something more of my life.

59:15.820 --> 59:17.788
To not be mediocre.
Like you with the CIA.

59:17.822 --> 59:20.124
Or cashew when wanting
to run for president.

59:20.157 --> 59:23.127
- Okay. -I'm mediocre.
You're better than me.

59:23.160 --> 59:24.662
I'm apple Mccreighton-hill.

59:24.695 --> 59:26.230
Ivy league educated
because my parents

59:26.263 --> 59:27.665
manufactured more textbooks

59:27.698 --> 59:29.033
than anyone else in the world.

59:29.066 --> 59:30.701
And, when I tried to be
more than that,

59:30.735 --> 59:32.603
- I failed.
- No, you didn't.

59:32.637 --> 59:35.005
It's okay. You don't have
to make me feel better.

59:35.039 --> 59:37.274
There's a point in everyone's
life when they realize

59:37.307 --> 59:40.144
what they're really
capable of, all right?

59:40.177 --> 59:43.380
Go back to your
CIA interview preparation

59:43.413 --> 59:45.249
and your stakeout training.

59:45.282 --> 59:47.251
You're off the hook, coach.

59:47.284 --> 59:49.787
I've got to get to class,
and find me a man,

59:49.820 --> 59:53.157
'cause I'm not leaving here
without my m-r-s.

59:53.190 --> 59:54.859
You mean, MBA?

59:54.892 --> 59:58.195
No, missus.
Missus something.

59:58.228 --> 01:00:00.731
I will be a wife.

01:00:00.765 --> 01:00:01.999
Mm-hmm.

01:00:04.969 --> 01:00:07.805
You know what,
contrary to popular belief,

01:00:07.838 --> 01:00:10.975
guys, economics can be fun.

01:00:11.008 --> 01:00:13.043
I feel like everybody
has a preconceived notion

01:00:13.077 --> 01:00:16.080
about what economics is.

01:00:16.113 --> 01:00:18.415
Economics is a
ever-changing, ever-present,

01:00:18.448 --> 01:00:20.084
living, breathing thing.

01:00:20.117 --> 01:00:23.253
It evolves with us
as the world evolves.

01:00:23.287 --> 01:00:25.089
Thank you so much.

01:00:25.122 --> 01:00:27.057
Thank you.
Great participation today.

01:00:27.091 --> 01:00:29.393
Thank you. Jason, beard's
looking healthy, by the way.

01:00:29.426 --> 01:00:31.028
I shampooed it last night.

01:00:31.061 --> 01:00:33.230
Did you? I can tell.
Hey, guys, also, uh, test,

01:00:33.263 --> 01:00:34.999
third test this semester
is this week.

01:00:35.032 --> 01:00:36.333
Don't forget.
All right?

01:00:36.366 --> 01:00:38.435
Apple? Apple, what, no,
no assignment from you?

01:00:38.468 --> 01:00:40.971
- Just give me a zero.
- A zero? Okay.

01:00:41.005 --> 01:00:43.140
Uh, hey, wait up.

01:00:43.173 --> 01:00:45.275
This Saturday
after your competition,

01:00:45.309 --> 01:00:47.778
I was thinking maybe we
could, um, I don't know,

01:00:47.812 --> 01:00:49.279
just talk afterwards?

01:10:35.399 --> 01:10:36.733
Um, I'm sorry.
I can't.

01:10:36.766 --> 01:10:38.435
Because I am stuck here

01:10:38.468 --> 01:10:39.736
editing my personal statement

01:10:39.769 --> 01:10:42.439
for my interview this afternoon.

01:10:42.472 --> 01:10:45.609
Oh, my gosh.
I am so sorry, Cali.

01:10:45.642 --> 01:10:47.611
Oh, I meant to do it,
I totally did.

01:10:47.644 --> 01:10:48.945
I don't know what happened.

01:10:48.978 --> 01:10:50.814
[Cali]
I do.

01:10:50.847 --> 01:10:52.349
You forgot about everyone else

01:10:52.382 --> 01:10:55.018
and did exactly
what was best for you.

01:10:55.051 --> 01:10:57.554
Just like you did
with the gymnastics team.

01:10:57.587 --> 01:10:58.788
How 'bout I come by and...

01:11:00.957 --> 01:11:02.426
Cali?

01:11:02.459 --> 01:11:04.260
Why does everyone hang up on me?

01:11:05.529 --> 01:11:06.663
- [Hits door]
- Ugh!

01:11:06.696 --> 01:11:07.764
[Knocking on door]

01:11:10.534 --> 01:11:12.502
Look, this isn't about rugby

01:11:12.536 --> 01:11:14.304
or the gymnastics team.

01:11:14.338 --> 01:11:16.773
And I'm, I'm really
sorry about your team.

01:11:16.806 --> 01:11:18.775
But I need a character witness.

01:11:18.808 --> 01:11:20.610
I need someone
to tell them that I'm smart

01:11:20.644 --> 01:11:22.546
and that I didn't have to cheat.

01:11:22.579 --> 01:11:24.814
Right. Well, you'd think I
could help you with that,

01:11:24.848 --> 01:11:27.817
but, see, the girl that
I know who is smart

01:11:27.851 --> 01:11:30.487
stopped using her brain her
brain in class like a week ago.

01:11:32.055 --> 01:11:33.657
Good luck with your case.

01:11:42.799 --> 01:11:44.468
Cali, good luck
at your interview.

01:11:44.501 --> 01:11:45.802
I forgot my lucky handcuffs.

01:11:45.835 --> 01:11:46.936
Hug?

01:12:02.619 --> 01:12:05.088
Inappropriately assisting
fellow students

01:12:05.121 --> 01:12:08.592
with papers, lab reports,
and assignments,

01:12:08.625 --> 01:12:11.461
and accepting unauthorized money

01:12:11.495 --> 01:12:12.829
for her services.

01:12:12.862 --> 01:12:15.932
Do you understand
the charges against you?

01:12:15.965 --> 01:12:18.668
Yeah, I do. It was based on
their parents' gross income.

01:12:20.804 --> 01:12:23.907
Not what you charged.

01:12:23.940 --> 01:12:27.076
The charges against you.

01:12:27.110 --> 01:12:30.514
Oh.
Yes, yes, I do.

01:12:30.547 --> 01:12:33.583
- And how do you plead?
- Not guilty, your honor.

01:12:34.718 --> 01:12:37.554
Oh.
Your majesty.

01:12:37.587 --> 01:12:39.088
Your high...

01:12:39.122 --> 01:12:41.658
I don't know.
Your Dean York.

01:12:41.691 --> 01:12:43.593
[Groans]

01:12:49.633 --> 01:12:53.069
Sorry for the rough
treatment, miss Lyons.

01:12:53.102 --> 01:12:54.638
You understand.

01:12:54.671 --> 01:12:56.640
It is my honor to be here.

01:12:56.673 --> 01:12:59.509
I have been looking forward to
this day since I entered Greene.

01:12:59.543 --> 01:13:01.845
Yes, it does seem
that you've been busy.

01:13:01.878 --> 01:13:03.480
Practicing
your covert operations

01:13:03.513 --> 01:13:05.815
as a gymnastics coach.

01:13:05.849 --> 01:13:08.084
- How do you...
- We're the CIA.

01:13:10.119 --> 01:13:11.788
I got a "c" on the paper,

01:13:11.821 --> 01:13:13.790
and she charged me
30 extra dollars

01:13:13.823 --> 01:13:15.492
just to rewrite
the introduction.

01:13:15.525 --> 01:13:17.994
A "c"? I've never had
a student get a "c."

01:13:18.027 --> 01:13:20.530
And she kicked me out
of the office.

01:13:20.564 --> 01:13:23.433
Wait a minute.
I remember you.

01:13:23.467 --> 01:13:25.902
I didn't even look
at your paper.

01:13:25.935 --> 01:13:28.204
Okay. That's all for the witnesses.
That's all.

01:13:28.237 --> 01:13:30.574
The defendant
will now take the floor.

01:13:39.516 --> 01:13:42.586
The question is whether I
betrayed the academic code

01:13:42.619 --> 01:13:43.953
at Greene university.

01:13:46.055 --> 01:13:48.057
I will prove to you
that in no way

01:13:48.091 --> 01:13:49.993
did I assist the students
in accessing data

01:13:50.026 --> 01:13:51.761
they couldn't have found
on their own.

01:13:51.795 --> 01:13:53.630
I had my own thing going on

01:13:53.663 --> 01:13:55.632
and knew nothing
about gymnastics.

01:13:55.665 --> 01:13:58.668
But, then I remembered
Brenda Thompson.

01:13:58.702 --> 01:14:01.004
Agent 1954 to 1996.

01:14:01.037 --> 01:14:03.006
Who knew nothing
about the Sinhalese people

01:14:03.039 --> 01:14:04.874
before she was assigned
to go undercover

01:14:04.908 --> 01:14:06.242
with her tribe in India.

01:14:06.275 --> 01:14:09.713
And within two years,
she became their leader.

01:14:09.746 --> 01:14:11.047
So, in essence,

01:14:11.080 --> 01:14:12.916
all I did was lead the students

01:14:12.949 --> 01:14:15.785
to the correct resources
for each assignment.

01:14:15.819 --> 01:14:18.588
Resources that are
freely available.

01:14:18.622 --> 01:14:21.190
Right under their
smart little noses.

01:14:25.562 --> 01:14:27.130
Noses like Todd's.

01:14:29.065 --> 01:14:31.901
And now she knows
that five minutes late

01:14:31.935 --> 01:14:35.605
means 500 leg lifts.

01:14:35.639 --> 01:14:38.274
I can't even go
into the gym anymore.

01:14:38.307 --> 01:14:39.676
It's just...

01:14:39.709 --> 01:14:42.011
It's just too many memories.

01:14:42.045 --> 01:14:43.613
I'm sorry.

01:14:48.752 --> 01:14:50.153
Could we get Janice in here?

01:14:53.590 --> 01:14:56.560
Just like that, he left.

01:14:56.593 --> 01:14:59.062
And I thought some
stupid boy at Greene

01:14:59.095 --> 01:15:01.565
was gonna change my life.

01:15:03.166 --> 01:15:06.135
And you know who did?

01:15:06.169 --> 01:15:07.737
A team of gymnasts.

01:15:10.039 --> 01:15:12.308
All the work and sweat and tears

01:15:12.341 --> 01:15:14.544
we put into the classroom.

01:15:14.578 --> 01:15:17.814
And the best education I
receive was at a little gym.

01:15:21.217 --> 01:15:24.988
It's like your
creepy cat poster said.

01:15:25.021 --> 01:15:29.659
"If we all work together,
we all win together."

01:15:29.693 --> 01:15:33.229
The unsettling trip
down memory Lane aside

01:15:33.262 --> 01:15:37.200
and your insult
of my cat poster,

01:15:37.233 --> 01:15:39.569
notwithstanding,

01:15:39.603 --> 01:15:41.571
as the undergraduate Dean

01:15:41.605 --> 01:15:43.306
of Greene university,

01:15:43.339 --> 01:15:45.274
I announce this case

01:15:45.308 --> 01:15:48.211
- dismissed.
- [Sighs heavily]

01:15:48.244 --> 01:15:49.679
- Okay?
- Okay.

01:15:51.047 --> 01:15:52.115
[Dean York sighs]

01:15:52.148 --> 01:15:53.750
You know,

01:15:53.783 --> 01:15:55.719
our greatest glory is

01:15:55.752 --> 01:15:57.320
not in never falling,

01:15:57.353 --> 01:15:59.989
but in rising
every time we fall.

01:16:17.841 --> 01:16:19.242
Cali, I was wrong.

01:16:19.275 --> 01:16:21.711
College isn't about
meeting your husband.

01:16:28.351 --> 01:16:30.954
It's about meeting
your best friends.

01:16:42.398 --> 01:16:44.367
- Peace out.
- Later.

01:16:44.400 --> 01:16:46.235
- [Gasps]
- Whoa!

01:16:46.269 --> 01:16:47.403
Hey.

01:16:47.436 --> 01:16:49.272
I messed up.

01:16:49.305 --> 01:16:51.675
I'm truly sorry about your team.

01:16:51.708 --> 01:16:53.643
Right now I have to find Cali.

01:17:07.023 --> 01:17:08.257
Cali?

01:17:14.130 --> 01:17:15.364
Cali?

01:17:16.465 --> 01:17:18.134
Found me.

01:17:18.167 --> 01:17:19.769
Cali.

01:17:22.772 --> 01:17:25.074
I'm sorry.

01:17:25.108 --> 01:17:27.043
You've done everything
you could to help me,

01:17:27.076 --> 01:17:28.277
and I didn't do the one thing

01:17:28.311 --> 01:17:29.378
you asked me to.

01:17:29.412 --> 01:17:31.080
I'm a terrible friend.

01:17:31.114 --> 01:17:32.716
And a teammate.

01:17:36.119 --> 01:17:39.088
Not as terrible as I am
at interviewing.

01:17:39.122 --> 01:17:40.356
What happened?

01:17:40.389 --> 01:17:41.991
What can I do?
How can I fix this?

01:17:42.025 --> 01:17:43.392
They won't find
a better recruit.

01:17:43.426 --> 01:17:46.763
No, apple.
You can't fix this.

01:17:46.796 --> 01:17:48.698
- But...
- [Cell phone buzzing]

01:17:50.967 --> 01:17:53.436
Ahem.
[Sniffles]

01:17:53.469 --> 01:17:55.872
- Cali Lyons.
- [Murmuring on phone]

- Mm-hmm.
- [Murmuring]

01:17:59.976 --> 01:18:01.210
Of course.

01:18:03.813 --> 01:18:05.348
Just tell me when.

01:18:11.120 --> 01:18:13.089
They said that...

01:18:13.122 --> 01:18:15.458
Crying showed an emotional
commitment to a team

01:18:15.491 --> 01:18:18.161
that surpassed the personal
awareness of a recruit

01:18:18.194 --> 01:18:20.196
with five times my experience.

01:18:22.065 --> 01:18:24.100
They want me to start
training with the CIA.

01:18:24.133 --> 01:18:25.969
[All cheering]

01:18:26.002 --> 01:18:28.805
- [Apple] Because she's so cool.
- [Cali] I know!

01:18:35.144 --> 01:18:36.144
Ladies.

01:18:37.480 --> 01:18:40.016
I know I don't deserve
a second chance.

01:18:40.049 --> 01:18:43.219
I asked you to be great
and then I abandoned you.

01:18:43.252 --> 01:18:46.055
But there is one more
competition.

01:18:46.089 --> 01:18:47.466
And we're actually
supposed to host it

01:18:47.490 --> 01:18:49.826
because
we're the newest members.

01:18:49.859 --> 01:18:52.495
The Ivy league throwdown.

01:18:52.528 --> 01:18:54.063
And I think
I know how to win it.

01:18:55.498 --> 01:18:57.801
Why should
we do anything you say?

01:18:57.834 --> 01:18:59.302
Yeah, I mean,
Cali is the only one

01:18:59.335 --> 01:19:01.905
who ever really coached us.

01:19:01.938 --> 01:19:03.172
And didn't dump us.

01:19:04.507 --> 01:19:07.010
Yep, that's true.

01:19:07.043 --> 01:19:08.812
You know...

01:19:08.845 --> 01:19:11.747
I think apple
has learned some hard lessons.

01:19:13.516 --> 01:19:16.119
Maybe we should give her
another chance.

01:19:18.421 --> 01:19:20.123
And besides, I was just copying

01:19:20.156 --> 01:19:21.357
other coaches.

01:19:21.390 --> 01:19:22.926
I think apple
can actually get us

01:19:22.959 --> 01:19:24.027
where we need to be.

01:19:26.229 --> 01:19:28.898
