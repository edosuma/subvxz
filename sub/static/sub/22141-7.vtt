That's part of it.

29:44.833 --> 29:46.800
But apparently you can.

29:48.733 --> 29:52.467
Is Seattle a teeming hive
of serial killers?

29:52.500 --> 29:55.833
Or am I just an idiot with a
morbidly overactive imagination

29:55.867 --> 30:00.367
and an attraction to
the dark, ugly side of life?

30:00.400 --> 30:03.533

30:22.900 --> 30:26.067
Why does it seem that there's
a disproportionate number

30:26.100 --> 30:30.000
of serial killers in the Seattle
and Washington State area?

30:30.033 --> 30:31.893
Do you have a theory on that?
Well, I don't think

30:31.900 --> 30:34.367
that most serial killers
are... are... went shopping

30:34.400 --> 30:35.633
for areas where they live.

30:35.667 --> 30:37.700
This is just where
they ended up.

30:37.733 --> 30:39.400
- Mm-hmm.

I mean, I can talk to you
about it and all that,

30:49.833 --> 30:51.800
but I hope you never have
