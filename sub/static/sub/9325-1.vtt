WEBVTT

02:53.300 --> 02:56.900
Here, Bessie. Come on, Bessie.
Come on. Go get your stick.

03:00.000 --> 03:01.500
Chuck!

03:04.850 --> 03:06.000
Chuck!

03:07.300 --> 03:09.500
Come on. You ready?

03:15.800 --> 03:18.500
- You all set?
- Yeah, I think so.

03:19.350 --> 03:21.600
It'll all be here when you get back.

03:21.750 --> 03:23.350
I know.

03:26.350 --> 03:29.000
You're not having second thoughts?

03:29.150 --> 03:30.650
No. Why?

03:30.800 --> 03:32.050
It's a year of your life.

03:32.200 --> 03:34.900
And this Ocean Academy
isn't recognized as accredited.

03:35.100 --> 03:38.550
- By Yale.
- By any Ivy League school.

03:38.700 --> 03:41.300
You can't afford two of us at Yale or Brown

03:41.450 --> 03:43.200
or any Ivy League school, anyway, dad.

03:43.400 --> 03:45.450
Your brother got a scholarship,
and you know you'd get one too.

03:45.650 --> 03:47.000
I'm not him!

03:47.200 --> 03:49.850
I just don't care about that stuff right now.

03:52.250 --> 03:54.700
It'll be a good thing, dad.

04:01.050 --> 04:03.200
- Here.
- Thanks, mom.

04:03.350 --> 04:05.200
- You have everything?
- Yes.

04:05.350 --> 04:08.400
- Passport?
- I'll be fine, mom.

04:08.600 --> 04:12.100
Why do you look so down?
This is your dream come true.

04:12.250 --> 04:14.650
- That's not why he's letting me go.
- Of course it is.

04:14.800 --> 04:19.050
No. It's because he hopes
it'll look good on my record.

04:19.200 --> 04:22.350
Well, either way, you're going.

04:22.500 --> 04:25.600
Besides, he would've loved
to have been able to do this.

04:25.750 --> 04:28.750
- Then why didn't he?
- He never had the opportunity.

04:28.900 --> 04:33.250
It hasn't been easy for him, both
his boys going off at the same time.

04:33.400 --> 04:34.600
All right.

04:34.750 --> 04:36.600
This is your bus ticket to Idlewild.

04:36.800 --> 04:39.600
- Sir?
- Just this one.

04:39.800 --> 04:42.200
And this will get you from Idlewild to Miami.

04:42.300 --> 04:43.700
- And this is your plane tIcket--
- Dad?

04:44.000 --> 04:46.900
I'll be okay. Really.

04:48.600 --> 04:51.950
- Make us proud, son.
- Okay.

04:55.800 --> 04:58.750
<i>Today the adventure begins.</i>

04:58.900 --> 05:00.700
<i>I've given up my last year of high school</i>

05:00.800 --> 05:04.100
<i>to join the crew of the brigantine
school ship, Albatross,</i>

05:04.250 --> 05:07.200
<i>to sail halfway around the world and back.</i>

05:07.800 --> 05:10.150
<i>Dad's made me promise to keep a journal.</i>

05:10.300 --> 05:14.150
<i>It's like a chore, but it's part
of the deal I had to make.</i>

05:14.300 --> 05:17.750
<i>Because today, I leave the path
that he had chosen for me</i>

05:17.950 --> 05:20.850
<i>and instead take my own.</i>

06:09.750 --> 06:11.200
Albatross?

06:12.350 --> 06:13.750
Yeah.

06:14.200 --> 06:16.650
Robert March. Who the hell are you?

06:17.000 --> 06:19.150
Gieg, Chuck.

06:33.800 --> 06:37.300
Gieg Chuck? What are you,
a native or something?

06:37.500 --> 06:40.150
No, it's just Chuck.

06:40.300 --> 06:44.050
Hey, Johnstone, I'm surprised to see
you here after the old bowsprit affair.

06:44.200 --> 06:46.600
- Yeah, well I'm back for some more.
- Listen to this, man.

06:46.700 --> 06:50.000
Romeo here was going at it with some
local girl up in the jibsheet, right?

06:50.100 --> 06:52.000
- After the deed was done.
- Whoa, whoa, hey!

06:52.150 --> 06:55.000
- He says they did the deed.
- Trust me. We did the deed.

06:55.100 --> 06:59.250
All right, man. After the alleged deed
was done, they fell asleep.

06:59.400 --> 07:02.850
Mr. McCrea walks on deck
and hears casanova sawing logs.

07:03.000 --> 07:04.500
He calls the whole crew on deck,

07:04.700 --> 07:06.800
up goes the jib,
and out roll Tod-o and the girl

07:06.900 --> 07:09.200
naked as goddamn Adam and Eve,
man, I swear.

07:10.450 --> 07:14.050
Whoa! Here we are, guys.
Home, sweet hell on water.

07:44.200 --> 07:45.500
Let's go.

07:46.100 --> 07:49.000
- I give you one dollar for every fish.
- Oh, no, no.

08:02.800 --> 08:04.000
What happened to it?

08:04.200 --> 08:05.800
She cleans up.

08:05.900 --> 08:08.300
We'll have her shipshape
before she shoves off.

08:08.500 --> 08:09.700
Come on.

08:24.750 --> 08:27.150
"Now would I give
a thousand furlongs of sea

08:27.350 --> 08:29.150
- "for an acre of barren ground.
- Oh, shit!

08:29.350 --> 08:34.900
"long heath, brown furze, anything.
The wills above be done.

08:35.049 --> 08:39.450
"But I would fain die a dry death."

08:41.000 --> 08:43.100
Remember? Hello, Robert.

08:43.250 --> 08:46.000
Excuse me, sir, but what's that
supposed to mean?

08:46.200 --> 08:50.200
It's Shakespeare, Tod.
'The Tempest', Act 1, Scene 1.

08:50.350 --> 08:52.300
- I suggest you read it.
- Yeah, and why is that?

08:52.500 --> 08:58.000
Because it's the song you'll all be
singing when we put out to sea.

08:58.700 --> 09:00.200
Arbedar!

09:00.300 --> 09:02.000
Arbedar.

09:03.500 --> 09:06.000
Oh, geez, man. I forgot about him.

09:08.300 --> 09:09.600
So, where are you from, Robert?

09:09.700 --> 09:11.600
- Callfornia, man. Here, have a smoke.
- Thanks.

09:11.700 --> 09:13.550
How're you doing? Robert March.

09:13.700 --> 09:15.600
Dean Preston.

09:15.750 --> 09:19.700
- Hi, my name is Gil Martin.
- Hi, Chuck Gieg.

09:20.850 --> 09:22.100
That's my brother.

09:24.600 --> 09:25.700
He's dead.

09:30.000 --> 09:32.000
I'm going to take this one.

09:33.750 --> 09:36.900
Well, in case you haven't noticed,
it's already been taken.

09:37.100 --> 09:39.550
- What's wrong with that one?
- What?

09:39.700 --> 09:41.950
I'm sure it's just as comfortable
as this one is,

09:42.100 --> 09:45.500
but, you know, I get nosebleeds, so...

09:48.650 --> 09:52.000
Does anyone have a problem with that?

09:52.200 --> 09:54.100
- Do you?
- Absolutely not!

09:54.250 --> 09:55.700
Okay, guys, listen up.

09:55.850 --> 09:58.000
Shay Jennings, flrst mate of the Albatross.

09:58.200 --> 10:00.550
This here is Dr. Alice Sheldon.

10:00.750 --> 10:02.000
I'm ship's surgeon.

10:02.200 --> 10:04.000
I'm in charge of your aches and pains.

10:04.150 --> 10:07.150
And I teach blology, math and science.

10:07.300 --> 10:09.850
Gerard Pascal here is the ship's cook.

10:10.050 --> 10:12.800
You want to keep all your fingers, huh?

10:13.000 --> 10:15.000
Stay the hell out of my galley,

10:15.200 --> 10:17.450
unless you're invited
and you have clean hands.

10:17.600 --> 10:19.400
Some of you already met Mr. McCrea.

10:19.500 --> 10:22.400
And in case you haven't figured it out,
he teaches English.

10:22.800 --> 10:26.100
So, when the heck do we get
to meet el capitan, huh?

10:26.300 --> 10:28.450
Maybe he's getting his wooden leg waxed.

10:28.650 --> 10:30.900
- Skipper on deck!
- Hello.

10:31.900 --> 10:33.500
On your feet, gentlemen.

10:34.000 --> 10:35.200
Come on, let's go!

10:47.750 --> 10:49.000
Martin.

10:51.000 --> 10:52.150
Preston.

10:54.850 --> 10:56.200
Johnstone.

10:58.500 --> 10:59.950
Lapchick.

11:07.650 --> 11:10.000
Get rid of it, March.

11:11.900 --> 11:13.000
Dowd.

11:13.300 --> 11:15.000
Flamberg.

11:15.150 --> 11:16.500
Burrows.

11:18.750 --> 11:19.950
Gieg.

11:22.300 --> 11:24.700
You're gonna wanna lose that.

11:28.000 --> 11:31.500
- Who'd I miss?
- Beaumont, sir. He's not here yet.

11:34.550 --> 11:37.900
The ship beneath you is not a toy,

11:38.050 --> 11:41.000
and sailing's not a game.

11:41.950 --> 11:44.600
The Albatross will take us far, gentlemen,

11:44.800 --> 11:48.250
but she demands constant attention.

11:48.400 --> 11:52.400
Respect that, and we'll do fine.

11:55.600 --> 11:58.450
One more thing.

11:58.600 --> 12:01.550
Nothing happens on this ship
that I don't know about.

12:01.700 --> 12:07.000
She speaks to me in the night,
so don't test me.

12:09.250 --> 12:11.000
Not even a little.

12:29.700 --> 12:32.350
"No man is an island, entire of itself.

12:32.500 --> 12:36.100
"And therefore never send to
know for whom the bell tolls.

12:36.250 --> 12:38.000
"It tolls for thee."

12:39.000 --> 12:40.050
John Donne.

12:40.750 --> 12:43.150
I'll see you on deck. Let's go!

12:43.300 --> 12:45.000
All right!

12:45.200 --> 12:47.400
Come on, roll out, sailors!
All hands on deck!

12:47.550 --> 12:50.000
60 seconds. That's one minute, Johnstone.

12:50.200 --> 12:52.300
Go, boys! Faster, faster!

12:52.600 --> 12:55.900
Go, go, go! Faster!
Come on, run, run, run!

12:56.000 --> 12:59.600
All right. Guys, line up single file, please.
Single file, single file.

12:59.800 --> 13:01.150
Okay, everybody, swim!

13:01.700 --> 13:03.700
Come on, guys, I'm not joking.
Into the water.

13:09.950 --> 13:12.000
I'm not joking, boys. Come on,
into the water. Let's go!

13:12.200 --> 13:14.300
Let's go! Everyone! Go, go, go!

13:19.300 --> 13:21.300
Hey, Preston, what's the matter now?

13:21.450 --> 13:23.450
Come on, man, everyone swims.

13:26.750 --> 13:28.450
I don't.

13:28.650 --> 13:30.500
You will if you want to eat.

13:31.000 --> 13:34.000
You gonna swim for your breakfast,
you little weasel?

13:46.700 --> 13:48.000
Go for it, man!

13:48.900 --> 13:51.150
- All right.
- Come on, you sissy, go!

13:54.200 --> 13:55.400
Let's go, you little monkey.

13:55.500 --> 13:56.600
Come on, Shay!

13:56.700 --> 13:58.000
Move it, you maggot!

14:00.200 --> 14:02.500
Show them what you're made of!

14:17.450 --> 14:20.000
- Yeah!
- Nice dice!

14:24.600 --> 14:26.500
Not too bad.

14:28.950 --> 14:32.000
All right. I've been in twice.

14:33.000 --> 14:34.500
So, what's it gonna be?

14:54.000 --> 14:56.300
I've got five bucks that says he doesn't.

14:58.050 --> 15:01.800
- I got ten says he doesn't live.
- I'll take a dollar of that.

15:05.900 --> 15:09.200
- Jesus!
- I can't watch this.

15:32.950 --> 15:34.200
Ay!

15:49.950 --> 15:52.000
Skipper on deck!

16:04.050 --> 16:06.650
You know what's out there?

16:07.600 --> 16:11.750
Wind and rain and some damn big waves.

16:12.900 --> 16:17.800
Reefs and rocks and sandbars.

16:18.000 --> 16:21.150
And enough fog and night to hide it all.

16:21.300 --> 16:23.450
So, why the hell do it, then?

16:23.600 --> 16:25.350
Builds character, Mr. Preston,

16:25.550 --> 16:28.600
of which you are in desperately short supply.

16:29.200 --> 16:31.550
The kind you only find on
mountaintops and deserts,

16:31.700 --> 16:36.400
on battlefields and across oceans.

16:40.850 --> 16:43.650
Nice dive, Preston.

16:43.850 --> 16:47.650
If we don't have order, we have nothing.

16:52.000 --> 16:55.150
"Where we go one, we go all."

16:58.500 --> 17:01.600
<i>Some of us are here for discipline,
some for escape.</i>

17:01.750 --> 17:04.099
<i>And the rest don't even know why.</i>

17:04.250 --> 17:05.700
<i>I'm not sure where I fit in,</i>

17:05.800 --> 17:09.000
<i>but l can see a small piece
of myself in each of them.</i>

17:09.300 --> 17:13.300
<i>I think I'll have friends here,
and I hope this will be home.</i>

17:20.849 --> 17:22.200
What are you looking at?

17:26.700 --> 17:28.700
Why'd you jump?

17:28.900 --> 17:31.000
'Cause I felt like it.

17:32.900 --> 17:34.550
It was so high, you know.

17:34.700 --> 17:36.800
Let me tell you something.

17:36.900 --> 17:37.550
As soon as you grow some balls, doughnut,

17:37.700 --> 17:40.350
let me know, and I'll tell you all about it.

17:40.500 --> 17:43.500
I thought it was a pretty
stupid stunt myself too.

17:47.400 --> 17:49.150
What was that?

17:49.300 --> 17:51.550
You heard what I said.

17:55.550 --> 17:57.600
Don't ever call me stupid.

17:59.200 --> 18:01.000
He didn't mean it.

18:04.800 --> 18:05.700
Let me tell you girls something.

18:05.800 --> 18:07.800
I do what I wanna do when I wanna do it,

18:07.950 --> 18:12.000
and I don't give a damn what some
ahab up there says otherwise.

18:21.000 --> 18:23.500
Oh, that's a big bear, man!

18:24.400 --> 18:28.100
Well, if it ain't Howard Hughes
come to fly me home, boys.

18:28.400 --> 18:30.500
There you go. That's it.

18:31.450 --> 18:34.000
No, use your whole hand, your whole hand.

18:38.000 --> 18:40.000
What's the matter with you? The other way!

18:47.750 --> 18:50.300
Ahoy there!

18:52.650 --> 18:55.000
Good afternoon!

19:07.450 --> 19:10.050
Albatross, huh?

19:10.250 --> 19:12.650
Doesn't lnsplre a lot of confidence, does it?

19:12.800 --> 19:17.050
On the contrary, the albatross
is considered a very good omen.

19:17.200 --> 19:19.550
Legend has it they embody
the spirits of lost sallors.

19:19.750 --> 19:21.550
Only bad luck if you kill one.

19:21.700 --> 19:24.000
I'm not interested in legends.

19:28.300 --> 19:32.400
Francis Beaumont.
That's my son behind you, Frank.

19:32.900 --> 19:35.150
- Frank.
- Sir.

19:35.350 --> 19:38.050
You're a day late.
We keep a schedule aboard ship.

19:38.200 --> 19:39.700
Lives depend on it.

19:39.850 --> 19:42.750
Your cable said you would not be
putting out until late October.

19:42.950 --> 19:44.700
As you can see, there's a lot of work to do.

19:46.850 --> 19:50.500
Indentured servitude is not
what my son had in mind.

19:51.000 --> 19:53.300
This is a working ship.

19:53.500 --> 19:55.800
Promptness is not a luxury, it's a necessity,

19:55.950 --> 19:58.200
as is the work to maintain her.

19:58.350 --> 20:00.600
Your son will do his part,
if he wants to stay on board.

20:00.800 --> 20:03.800
I'll be honest with you.
This was his mother's idea.

20:03.950 --> 20:05.900
A romp through the Caribbean
on a sailboat

20:06.000 --> 20:08.350
sounds more like a holiday
than an educatlon, if you ask me.

20:08.550 --> 20:11.650
It will be more than that, I can promise you.

20:11.800 --> 20:13.000
All right.

20:16.550 --> 20:19.500
You take good care of my son.

20:23.050 --> 20:26.000
He'll need a hand with that. It's heavy.

20:26.800 --> 20:30.850
- Well, Frank.
- We'll do our best.

20:36.800 --> 20:39.000
Take him below, Shay.

20:49.600 --> 20:51.200
Sing along. Go!

21:00.850 --> 21:03.950
You got it. He's got it. Atta boy!

21:11.000 --> 21:12.200
Keep moving up.

21:12.300 --> 21:14.050
Look up when you're going up.
Not so fast, Frank.

21:14.800 --> 21:16.050
That's it!

21:16.250 --> 21:17.700
Keep your arms straight, shoulder length.

21:17.800 --> 21:19.900
Okay, now I want you out on these spars,

21:20.000 --> 21:23.000
but I don't want you to release
the gaskets until I tell you.

21:23.100 --> 21:26.000
That's good. Just keep
your back inside the backrope.

21:26.200 --> 21:28.800
Okay, now remember, these are sails.

21:28.900 --> 21:31.000
They can shift, they're not locked.

21:31.600 --> 21:33.050
- Avast hauling.
- Over.

21:33.200 --> 21:35.000
Stop!

21:35.450 --> 21:38.700
Gentlemen, when you hear
an order, shout it out!

21:38.900 --> 21:41.050
I want to know you've heard and understand.

21:41.200 --> 21:43.250
- Set the main.
- Set the main!

21:43.750 --> 21:44.900
Set the main!

21:45.000 --> 21:47.050
- Set the main!
- Main!

21:48.150 --> 21:51.850
Heave! Heave!

22:00.950 --> 22:03.650
Shay! Skliper! Skipper!

22:06.400 --> 22:08.100
Get him!

22:09.300 --> 22:12.450
Get him! Somebody, get to him!

22:14.800 --> 22:15.900
Excuse me!

22:27.600 --> 22:28.700
Come here!

22:31.500 --> 22:33.000
Put your feet up here.

22:45.300 --> 22:47.000
All right, come on.

22:49.250 --> 22:51.650
Watch yourself now.

22:54.800 --> 22:56.750
- Okay, take it easy.
- Are you all right?

22:56.900 --> 22:58.700
- Yeah.
- Huh?

22:58.900 --> 23:00.400
It was my fault. I was...

23:00.550 --> 23:03.000
I was reaching for the...

23:15.550 --> 23:18.000
Why didn't you climb up there, son?

23:19.200 --> 23:21.200
Speak up.

23:22.750 --> 23:25.450
'Cause he's afraid to climb.

23:26.900 --> 23:29.050
ls that true?

23:29.500 --> 23:31.400
Shay, why wasn't l made aware of this?

23:31.600 --> 23:33.950
It's your job to know.

23:34.100 --> 23:36.250
lf something goes wrong up there,
the other 16 people on board

23:36.350 --> 23:39.000
can't be wondering,
if he's going to do his job or not.

23:42.900 --> 23:44.650
- Swing up, son.
- What?

23:44.850 --> 23:47.200
Up you go, right now.

24:05.800 --> 24:08.600
- You got something to say?
- No.

24:09.300 --> 24:11.100
Then keep your mouth shut!

24:11.300 --> 24:13.950
It takes disclpline to make it out here.

24:14.100 --> 24:16.700
There are no special cases.

24:21.050 --> 24:22.500
Now, what's it gonna be?

24:24.400 --> 24:27.700
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry's not gonna cut it.

24:30.100 --> 24:33.050
Now, get up there! Get going!

24:36.600 --> 24:37.300
That's it.

24:42.650 --> 24:45.400
One hand in front of the other, son.

24:48.700 --> 24:51.000
We'll do it together.

24:52.150 --> 24:54.600
And don't look down. You look in my eyes.

24:54.800 --> 24:56.200
Look in my eyes!

24:58.000 --> 24:59.200
Climb.

25:01.950 --> 25:04.000
Come on, we'll do it together.

25:04.700 --> 25:08.500
- I can't.
- You climb, damn it!

25:08.650 --> 25:10.400
Yeah, that's it!

25:13.150 --> 25:15.750
You're hating this? Huh, are you?

25:15.850 --> 25:17.300
I hate you, you son of a bitch.

25:17.450 --> 25:18.800
Good! Good!

25:18.900 --> 25:20.900
Hate your way up another rung.

25:21.050 --> 25:22.700
Do it right now!

25:29.000 --> 25:30.500
All right, all right.

25:31.700 --> 25:33.800
All right, come down.

25:34.900 --> 25:36.900
- Oh, God!
- Stay there.

25:37.000 --> 25:39.850
You're all right. That's it.

25:40.000 --> 25:41.200
Come on.

25:43.600 --> 25:46.000
That's it, it's all right.

25:49.350 --> 25:52.100
- It's all right.
- I'm sorry.

25:56.900 --> 25:59.500
I'm only going to say this one time.

25:59.700 --> 26:02.400
I'm not here to wipe
your noses and your asses.

26:02.550 --> 26:05.800
I'm not your mother.
He can take care of himself.

26:11.550 --> 26:14.700
Are there any other phobias
I need to know about?

26:15.200 --> 26:18.200
- No, sir.
- Excellent!

26:18.650 --> 26:23.000
Shay, find Mr. Martin a positlon
to suit his conditlon.

26:23.150 --> 26:25.400
And remember something.

26:25.600 --> 26:30.050
Sooner or later, we all have to face it.

26:40.300 --> 26:41.400
Hey.

26:49.750 --> 26:52.500
We're awfully quiet tonight.

26:54.100 --> 26:57.050
Something on your mind, Gerard?

26:57.200 --> 26:59.700
I think you were too tough on Martin.

26:59.850 --> 27:02.400
- You do, huh?
- Yes, I do.

27:04.050 --> 27:07.500
They're green, all of 'em,
and full of themselves.

27:07.650 --> 27:09.750
That's a dangerous combination.

27:09.900 --> 27:12.900
- He pissed on his pants.
- Mmm, and all over me.

27:13.100 --> 27:15.900
What do you call that, humiliation training?

27:16.050 --> 27:18.450
Because I'm pretty familiar
with psychological theory.

27:18.600 --> 27:20.300
- The point is--
- There's nothing I've read...

27:20.450 --> 27:22.150
Because what you do,
you traumatlze the kid.

27:22.300 --> 27:24.300
- The point is!
- And you--

27:24.500 --> 27:25.850
We're as strong as our weakest link.

27:25.950 --> 27:27.900
I don't want to find that out the hard way.

27:28.050 --> 27:29.800
So,I will challenge them as will you,

27:30.000 --> 27:33.000
and they will come together.

27:34.550 --> 27:36.500
And I don't care lf they like me or not.

27:36.650 --> 27:39.150
Does that apply to the staff, too, sir?

27:40.950 --> 27:43.100
I'll tell you what, Gerard.

27:43.250 --> 27:45.550
I'll stay out of your galley,
you stay off my poop deck.

27:45.700 --> 27:48.150
We'll get along fine that way.

27:49.500 --> 27:52.200
Otherwise, it's going to be a long ride.

27:53.650 --> 27:55.150
I want a head count when they're in the racks.

27:55.250 --> 27:57.500
We're putting out in the morning.
Good night!

27:57.700 --> 27:58.700
Good night, skipper.

27:58.800 --> 28:00.700
- Good night, Alice.
- Good night.

28:05.000 --> 28:07.200
I've seen him snatch the tail of a tempest

28:07.300 --> 28:09.800
and stuff it screaming into a bottle.

28:10.000 --> 28:11.400
The bilges are full of 'em.

28:11.550 --> 28:13.550
McCrea, what do you mean by that?

28:13.750 --> 28:15.400
He's been beyond the reach.

28:18.700 --> 28:22.850
He'll do well by us all, Gerard.
He's a real salt.

28:27.850 --> 28:29.550
Got one for me?

28:29.700 --> 28:32.650
No, these I paid two dollars for Havana.

28:32.800 --> 28:34.750
Oh, yeah!

29:16.400 --> 29:18.500
How're you doing?

29:19.750 --> 29:23.100
Look, I appreciate, you know,
your concern and all,

29:23.250 --> 29:27.600
but, like skipper said,
I can take care of myself.

29:27.750 --> 29:29.500
I know.

29:30.250 --> 29:33.000
I just brought you a coke.

29:44.450 --> 29:46.900
I feel like I got you into this.

29:47.100 --> 29:49.700
Forget it.

29:51.450 --> 29:53.700
My own brother and I used to...

29:55.000 --> 29:56.800
climb to the top of this old beech tree
in the backyard

29:56.900 --> 30:00.000
and watch the sun go down just like this.

30:02.850 --> 30:08.100
My parents, they'd... fight a lot,

30:08.250 --> 30:12.700
so we'd sneak out there
where we couldn't hear 'em.

30:15.650 --> 30:18.550
Do you believe I miss it?

30:20.100 --> 30:24.550
I mean, all the crap I had to put up
with at home and I'm still homesick.

30:27.400 --> 30:29.850
Well, I wouldn't worry.

30:30.000 --> 30:33.300
I'm sure they'll have some fight
left in them by the time we get back.

30:34.350 --> 30:37.000
That's a fact.

30:44.700 --> 30:46.900
<i>And so it was that after weeks of training</i>

30:47.050 --> 30:48.850
<i>with the hurricane season behind us,</i>

30:49.000 --> 30:51.500
<i>the Albatross took to the open sea.</i>

30:51.700 --> 30:55.400
<i>In each of us were feelings of excitement
and hesitation for the man at the helm</i>

30:56.000 --> 30:59.400
<i>and the unfamiliar world
he would be leading us into.</i>

30:59.200 --> 31:00.500
Gieg.

31:02.000 --> 31:03.800
Come here. Take the wheel.

31:04.900 --> 31:06.500
Come here.

31:08.850 --> 31:12.100
Hold her steady into the wind,
southwest by west.

31:12.250 --> 31:13.800
Yes, sir.

31:13.950 --> 31:17.800
Holding her steady southwest by west, sir.

31:17.950 --> 31:21.000
# In South Australia 'round Cape Horn #

31:21.400 --> 31:23.900
What's wrong, Mr. McCrea?

31:24.050 --> 31:26.700
Seems like we're short on singers, skipper.

31:26.900 --> 31:29.950
Everyone sings aboard a windjammer,
gentlemen.

31:30.150 --> 31:32.800
Lets everyone know you're in sync.

31:32.950 --> 31:36.150
It shows unity, that all thoughts are one.

31:36.300 --> 31:38.150
Besides, I like it.

31:38.300 --> 31:42.550
# Heave away, you rolling kings
Heave away, haul away #

31:42.750 --> 31:45.000
# Heave away, you'll hear me sing #

31:51.300 --> 31:54.050
We'll bear off to port and run downwind.

31:55.600 --> 31:58.500
Okay, Mr. McCrea, stand by
to ease the main sheet.

31:58.650 --> 32:01.700
Robert, get on the jibsheet.
Four guys to go along.

32:01.800 --> 32:04.250
Fall off to port, ease her around
to a heading of northeast.

32:04.400 --> 32:07.000
- Sing out when you're there.
- Yes, sir.

32:07.300 --> 32:10.200
All right, stand by to loose the squares.

32:11.100 --> 32:12.950
- Northeast, sir.
- Speak up, boy!

32:13.100 --> 32:15.100
- Northeast, sir!
- Loose the squares!

32:15.200 --> 32:17.000
Loose the squares!

32:23.850 --> 32:25.200
All right, loosen those gaskets.

32:25.300 --> 32:28.700
All the other sails up.
What's taking so long, huh?

32:30.750 --> 32:33.400
Keep your eye on the pennant, Chuck.

32:34.150 --> 32:36.200
lf you jib now, we'll have people in the water.

32:36.400 --> 32:37.500
Yes, sir!

32:41.200 --> 32:43.000
Storm at sea!

32:44.500 --> 32:47.700
All stop on the engine.

33:14.400 --> 33:17.500
Behold the power of the wind.

33:54.950 --> 33:57.850
Skipper, the crew is doing
group boot over the side.

33:58.000 --> 34:01.000
All right, keep it over the side. That's it.

34:01.200 --> 34:03.600
Come on, Okay.

34:03.750 --> 34:07.850
Whoa, boy, watch your step.

34:08.400 --> 34:09.699
Should we turn away?

34:09.800 --> 34:12.050
You can't run from the wind, son.

34:12.199 --> 34:15.000
You trim your sails, face the music,
and keep going.

34:15.199 --> 34:16.900
This guy's certifiable.

34:17.050 --> 34:18.449
No, he's suicidal, man.

34:18.650 --> 34:20.400
We won't have any crew left, skipper.

34:20.550 --> 34:22.000
Excellent point!

34:22.199 --> 34:25.699
How'd you like to have to bet on
Tracy here getting us home today?

34:26.150 --> 34:29.050
Each one of you is responsible for the rest.

34:29.250 --> 34:31.000
It's up to you.

34:32.000 --> 34:36.000
Nothing like a little experience
to put things in perspective, huh?

34:36.550 --> 34:38.900
I want you all to make sure
your gear is stowed.

34:39.100 --> 34:42.949
McCrea, your team will stand watch.
Everyone else hit the rack.

34:44.100 --> 34:46.000
Hey, skipper...

34:47.400 --> 34:49.500
Listen, I'm not staying out here, okay?

34:49.650 --> 34:52.850
Robert, take his place.

34:55.000 --> 34:56.300
Robert, I got an idea.

34:56.400 --> 34:59.150
Why don't you help me swab the decks?

35:07.100 --> 35:09.200
Stand by to go about.

35:19.700 --> 35:22.350
- Oh, god!
- Watch yourself. Get in your bunk.

35:23.500 --> 35:25.300
Checked out.

35:41.300 --> 35:44.500
- Harden up the main staysail.
- Aye, skipper.

35:45.000 --> 35:47.750
Harden up the main staysail.

35:54.000 --> 35:57.650
Jesus! Skipper, skipper, the jib's blown out!

35:58.000 --> 36:01.850
Bring it in and run up the storm jib.
Stay out of reach of the blocks!

36:06.100 --> 36:08.850
Haul on the down haul.

36:09.000 --> 36:11.500
Let go of your sheets.
Hold on to your clews and blocks.

36:12.600 --> 36:15.400
Well, we're in it now.

36:18.950 --> 36:20.700
Look out!

36:26.050 --> 36:27.400
- What do we do?
- Block and tackle!

36:27.500 --> 36:29.500
I'll go to block and tackle. Robert, here.

36:29.600 --> 36:31.750
- Hold on, Dean!
- I'm going in.

36:35.400 --> 36:37.550
Get him. Easy over, Alice.

36:44.650 --> 36:48.000
- Hold her steady!
- Holding her steady, sir!

36:49.700 --> 36:50.700
You all right?

36:50.800 --> 36:52.000
Hang on, Dean!

36:53.700 --> 36:55.000
More line!

36:58.100 --> 37:00.050
Hold on!

37:02.600 --> 37:04.700
Grab the line!

37:06.400 --> 37:07.400
Now the ladder.

37:13.000 --> 37:15.350
All right, take it.

37:15.500 --> 37:19.300
Come on in, Dean.
Swing around, all right?

37:24.400 --> 37:26.000
Come on. Are you all right?

37:26.100 --> 37:29.400
There you go. There you go, okay.

37:34.600 --> 37:35.900
You all right?

37:36.000 --> 37:39.700
Nice dive, Preston. You all right?

37:41.750 --> 37:44.700
Now you got something
to write home about.

37:45.300 --> 37:48.300
Leave my wife alone,
and go in and get warm.

37:48.450 --> 37:50.500
All right, let's bring her in
and run up the storm jib.

37:50.700 --> 37:53.500
Come on, let's bring the storm jib up.
Let's go!

38:06.750 --> 38:10.350
- Nicely done.
- Thank you, sir.

38:12.250 --> 38:14.200
You're enjoying this.

38:16.400 --> 38:18.700
Yes, sir.

38:20.400 --> 38:22.450
<i>The seas lasted 16 hours.</i>

38:22.650 --> 38:26.050
<i>And when we weren't throwing up,
it scared the hell out of us.</i>

38:26.200 --> 38:29.000
<i>Skipper never left the deck, not once.</i>

38:29.200 --> 38:31.300
<i>I think he loved every minute out there.</i>

38:31.500 --> 38:35.500
<i>He's strong, tough,
and he won't take no for an answer.</i>

38:35.700 --> 38:38.100
<i>But he makes you want to please him.</i>

38:38.250 --> 38:41.700
<i>I wonder if we'll ever live up
to his expectations.</i>

39:33.000 --> 39:34.450
Help me!

39:41.000 --> 39:43.200
Hey, Gil, wake up, wake up, wake up!

39:43.300 --> 39:45.550
Hey, hey, easy, easy, easy.

39:45.700 --> 39:47.000
It's okay.

39:48.050 --> 39:49.500
You're okay.

39:50.100 --> 39:53.050
- I was falling.
- It was just a bad dream.

39:54.050 --> 39:56.450
- It was so real.
- Here's the thing.

39:56.600 --> 39:59.000
Whenever you're having a nightmare
like that and you can't get out of it,

39:59.400 --> 40:03.300
all you have to do is say,
"One, two, three, wake up."

40:03.500 --> 40:05.050
"One, two, three, wake up." That's it.

40:05.200 --> 40:07.600
And you just come out of it.

40:08.550 --> 40:11.500
- Who told you that?
- My dad.

40:11.650 --> 40:14.400
It's the only good advice he ever gave me.

40:21.650 --> 40:24.050
ls that how he died?

40:26.400 --> 40:31.200
He fell out of the beech tree in the backyard

40:31.400 --> 40:34.700
and broke his neck.

40:37.700 --> 40:41.700
I was on a camp out away from home.

40:48.950 --> 40:51.350
They must've been going at it,

40:51.550 --> 40:56.050
you know, throwing things, pushing.

40:58.700 --> 41:01.500
A real knockdown .

41:04.350 --> 41:07.850
They didn't find him until the next morning.

41:11.600 --> 41:14.650
They didn't even know why he was up there.

41:18.700 --> 41:21.000
You never told them why he was there?

41:24.250 --> 41:25.500
I couldn't.

41:28.500 --> 41:29.700
I couldn't.

41:47.700 --> 41:50.000
Remember, be back by 7:00 p.m.

41:50.100 --> 41:53.400
We got a shallow reef to cross,
and I'm not going to wait.

42:06.400 --> 42:08.200
I could go for that in a heartbeat.

42:08.350 --> 42:11.050
Yeah, man, that was a matched set for sure.

42:11.250 --> 42:13.350
You're gonna be paying for it,
because she's a professional, boys.

42:13.550 --> 42:14.700
Yeah? How do you know that, huh?

42:14.850 --> 42:17.000
'Cause I know, man. I know.
Now believe me, I know.

42:17.200 --> 42:19.050
I'll tell you who's got some nice ones.

42:19.200 --> 42:20.300
- Who?
- Who?

42:20.450 --> 42:22.050
Dr. Alice Sheldon, that's who.

42:22.200 --> 42:24.050
Oh, yeah? How do you know that?

42:24.200 --> 42:28.050
Dogwatch, night after the storm,
I'm looking in the skipper's skylight.

42:28.200 --> 42:30.600
and there they were,
doing the nasty dance.

42:30.750 --> 42:33.000
- And you just happened to be standing there?
- What'd they look like?

42:33.100 --> 42:34.300
What?

42:34.500 --> 42:36.600
You know, her... hooters.

42:36.750 --> 42:39.200
Oh, come on, man. You sound
like you never even seen a pair.

42:39.300 --> 42:40.850
- Shut up, I've seen 'em.
- Oh, yeah!

42:41.000 --> 42:45.350
Well, even considering that she's 30...
boner city, fellas.

42:45.500 --> 42:46.700
No foolin', man?

42:46.800 --> 42:48.900
But, serlously, what'd they look like
for real though?

42:49.000 --> 42:52.250
- You're a damn virgin, aren't you?
- No.

43:00.750 --> 43:02.750
Come on. Give me what you got.
What you got there? Tod?

43:02.900 --> 43:04.700
- Here you go. That's a dollar.
- Tod?

43:04.800 --> 43:06.100
- A dollar from Robert.
- Let's go.

43:06.200 --> 43:07.650
Yeah, all right.

43:07.800 --> 43:09.150
This isn't enough. Come on, this is pathetic.

43:09.300 --> 43:10.200
You got something, Beaumont?

43:10.400 --> 43:13.150
I'm not gonna spend my money,
so Gil can get his cherry broken.

43:13.300 --> 43:14.500
- It's your daddy's money. All right.
- Come on, man!

43:14.600 --> 43:18.200
All right, daddy's boy, daddy's boy.
Hold that, Gieg.

43:18.350 --> 43:21.200
We're gonna spin for it then, just to
make Mr. daddy's boy happy, all right?

43:21.300 --> 43:23.000
- Yeah, let's spin it.
- All right?

43:23.400 --> 43:24.500
Here you go.

43:24.700 --> 43:26.100
Winner gets a 15-minute honeymoon.

43:26.250 --> 43:28.000
Gather around.

43:36.500 --> 43:38.000
All right! Go get 'em, tiger!

43:38.100 --> 43:40.800
Hey, man!

43:46.500 --> 43:49.700
- I got seven dollars.
- You must be in a hurry. Come on.

43:56.700 --> 43:57.900
Come on.

44:01.500 --> 44:04.250
- Money?
- Oh, right.

44:04.900 --> 44:07.000
Wait here.

44:07.500 --> 44:10.000
Okay. Okay.

44:12.400 --> 44:14.200
<i>Hey, Frank, what's taking you so long?</i>

44:14.300 --> 44:16.500
<i>Come on! We're waiting on you,
brother. Let's get outta here.</i>

44:16.700 --> 44:19.000
<i>Hey, Frank!</i>

44:28.750 --> 44:31.000
Hi, baby.

44:35.550 --> 44:37.700
What you waiting for?

44:38.300 --> 44:40.200
Whoa, whoa!

44:40.350 --> 44:42.800
- Hey, what happened?
- What?

44:43.000 --> 44:45.100
Nothing happened, all right?

44:47.000 --> 44:48.500
Why not? Oh, I don't know.
Let's see, let's see.

44:48.650 --> 44:50.300
Perhaps because she was
older than Moses?

44:50.500 --> 44:52.500
You still owe us 7 bucks.

44:52.600 --> 44:55.500
You set me up, all right? You set me up!

44:55.700 --> 44:57.700
Don't look at me, buddy.
You're the one with the...

45:00.300 --> 45:02.000
See you later, limpdick!

45:02.200 --> 45:04.100
Oh, I ran outta there.

45:04.300 --> 45:06.900
I turned and ran,
and slammed the door behind me.

45:07.100 --> 45:09.200
My parents don't do it anymore.

45:11.400 --> 45:14.800
They don't. I swear. They don't.
My parents don't do it anymore.

45:14.950 --> 45:17.500
They tell you that?

45:18.800 --> 45:21.700
No. I figured it out.

45:22.550 --> 45:25.150
What time is it?

45:25.300 --> 45:27.600
- What time is it?!
- Oh, shit, man!

45:45.500 --> 45:48.250
- Where is it?
- Jesus H. Christ!

45:49.000 --> 45:51.000
You guys, we're screwed!

45:54.350 --> 45:57.050
I knew we shouldn't've gone. I knew it.

45:57.200 --> 46:00.450
Shut up! You sound like my sister.

46:00.650 --> 46:02.300
How the hell do you idiots...

46:02.400 --> 46:03.350
- ...suppose we're going to get out of here?
- Shut up!

46:03.450 --> 46:05.150
We'll think of something.
We'll think of something, don't worry.

46:05.300 --> 46:06.650
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

46:06.800 --> 46:08.700
I feel so much better now that you're here,

46:08.800 --> 46:11.500
because lughead over here's gonna think...

46:13.500 --> 46:14.700
No, no, no, no!

46:23.500 --> 46:24.450
Dean!

46:30.000 --> 46:32.250
Yes, Chuck, nice!

46:33.000 --> 46:35.450
Up! Up! Come on!

46:35.550 --> 46:38.000
Get up! Let's go!

46:38.750 --> 46:41.750
Come on, get up!
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

46:44.700 --> 46:46.000
Skipper!

46:46.100 --> 46:48.650
You know what a loose cannon is?

46:49.300 --> 46:52.900
A couple of thousand pounds of pig iron
crashing around the deck in a storm.

46:53.000 --> 46:56.500
Maybe take out a mast,
punch a hole right through the hull.

46:56.700 --> 46:59.200
Send a man-of-war straight to the bottom.

46:59.300 --> 47:02.700
People are like that sometimes.

47:02.850 --> 47:05.950
Before you know it, they're
punching holes in everything.

47:07.300 --> 47:09.850
I'm thinking of shutting
this whole thing down.

47:11.700 --> 47:14.350
I can fly you all home from Grenada.

47:14.550 --> 47:16.400
It's gonna be new years
by the time we hit port.

47:16.500 --> 47:17.900
I want a tight ship.

47:18.050 --> 47:20.400
I want them all shaved and in
clean clothes when we get there.

47:20.500 --> 47:22.550
We have an obligation to host a cruise

47:22.700 --> 47:25.000
for some Dutch students there.

47:26.000 --> 47:28.500
Each one of you is going to be
responsible for a student.

47:28.700 --> 47:31.050
I expect you to be courteous and thoughtful.

47:31.200 --> 47:33.650
lf everything goes well and
your test scores are acceptable,

47:33.800 --> 47:35.200
I might reconsider.

47:35.350 --> 47:37.300
All right. That's it.
Get them on board, McCrea.

47:37.400 --> 47:38.600
Right, skipper.

47:38.700 --> 47:42.000
All right, come on, shake it off.
What happened, huh?

47:44.700 --> 47:48.150
<i>Unlike that of the soviets
since the end of world war Il,</i>

47:48.300 --> 47:52.750
<i>demonstrates that we have
no desire to dominate or conquer</i>

47:52.900 --> 47:54.350
<i>any other nation.</i>

47:54.550 --> 47:56.700
Johnstone, what do you say
l have a crack at the wheel there?

47:56.850 --> 47:58.200
Negative, twerp.

47:58.400 --> 48:00.500
And you still owe me two bucks.

48:00.700 --> 48:03.600
<i>...and become adjusted
to living daily on the bulI's-eye</i>

48:03.750 --> 48:05.550
<i>of soviet missiles</i>

48:05.700 --> 48:08.000
<i>located inside the U.S.S.R.</i>

48:08.500 --> 48:10.000
<i>or in submarines.</i>

48:10.700 --> 48:13.000
<i>In that sense, missiles in Cuba</i>

48:13.200 --> 48:16.000
<i>add to an already
clear and present danger.</i>

48:16.200 --> 48:18.100
<i>Although it should be noted</i>

48:18.250 --> 48:20.000
<i>the nations of Latin America</i>

48:20.200 --> 48:23.000

48:23.200 --> 48:25.750

48:25.900 --> 48:31.550
<i>But this secret, swift extraordinary
build-up of communist missiles</i>

48:31.750 --> 48:36.000
<i>in an area well-known to have a special

48:36.300 --> 48:39.000

<i>in violation of soviet assurances,</i>

48:42.000 --> 48:46.000
<i>and in defiance with american

49:06.150 --> 49:09.750
15 minutes, gentlemen. 15 minutes.

49:44.550 --> 49:45.850
Where're you going?

49:47.050 --> 49:49.750
- To take a piss.
- Oh, really?

49:50.450 --> 49:54.250
Yeah. You wanna come in
and shake it for me?

49:55.650 --> 49:58.000
What are you doing?

50:00.150 --> 50:01.850
You were cheating.

50:02.000 --> 50:04.250
- I don't want to listen to this.
- Yes, you do, stupid!

50:04.400 --> 50:08.000
You get caught cheating, your ass
is on the first plane back to Idiotville.

50:10.150 --> 50:12.500
Cut it out! Cut it out, Dean!

50:12.700 --> 50:14.950
Cut it out!

50:15.850 --> 50:18.000
lf Frank had caught you, he would
have ratted you out in a second.

50:18.100 --> 50:19.500
Listen to us!

50:19.700 --> 50:22.500
You get caught cheating
and you're off the boat!

50:25.200 --> 50:27.750
I cheated to get on the boat, damn it!

50:28.950 --> 50:32.650
I doctored the grades,
so I could make the cut.

50:33.850 --> 50:36.850
I'm a moron, all right?
Are you satisfied now?

50:37.050 --> 50:38.750
You're not a moron, Dean.

50:38.900 --> 50:40.450
Bet?

50:40.600 --> 50:43.900
It takes me half a day to get
through one chapter of McCrea,

50:44.000 --> 50:46.900
and I still don't have any idea
what he's talking about.

50:47.050 --> 50:49.800
Why it takes me so long
to write all those papers?

50:49.950 --> 50:52.150
Because I can't spell.

50:52.350 --> 50:56.400
They even kicked me out of vo-tech,
because I couldn't read a slide rule.

50:56.500 --> 50:58.200
That's right.

50:58.350 --> 51:00.500
I could show you how to read a slide rule.

51:01.500 --> 51:03.000
What the fuck?

51:09.000 --> 51:11.250
How long have you been standing there?

51:11.400 --> 51:12.700
Long enough.

51:14.800 --> 51:20.500
I'm never gonna pass the boards.

51:23.600 --> 51:25.750
I'll tell you what.

51:25.900 --> 51:27.500
You don't cheat anymore,

51:27.800 --> 51:30.000
and we'll make sure you get the grades.

51:31.100 --> 51:32.600
Okay? We'll start our own private study group.

51:32.700 --> 51:35.650
Nobody else knows. You'll ace that test.

51:36.750 --> 51:38.000
I'm in.

51:40.300 --> 51:41.500
Me too.

51:44.150 --> 51:46.800
Why would you guys do that?
You guys don't have to do that.

51:47.000 --> 51:49.600
Because, man, we...

51:49.750 --> 51:52.400
We got a hard-on for you, pansy.

52:25.700 --> 52:26.700
Whoa!

52:26.800 --> 52:27.900
- Oh, no, wait a minute.
- What do you got? What do you got?

52:28.000 --> 52:29.000
Whoa!

52:29.100 --> 52:31.000
- What, what, what?
- All right, fellas!

52:31.700 --> 52:33.300
We got women.

52:35.000 --> 52:37.000
Yes! Yes!

52:44.000 --> 52:47.000
Hold your head line! Slack your spring!

52:47.500 --> 52:48.850
Midships.

52:49.000 --> 52:50.500
Take a turn on the stern line.

52:51.150 --> 52:53.000
Get the heaving lines ready.

52:53.500 --> 52:55.650
Stand by the fenders!
Go on, get up there.

52:55.850 --> 52:58.000
Ready the line for the port side.

53:05.100 --> 53:07.400
All right, all right, all right.

53:08.000 --> 53:10.450
Be calm, gentlemen. Be calm.

53:12.500 --> 53:13.800
Slack your spring!

53:14.000 --> 53:15.350
Goddamn...

53:15.550 --> 53:17.000
Good morning, ladies.

53:17.100 --> 53:18.600
Good morning.

53:18.700 --> 53:22.300
All secure alongside. Finish with engines.

53:23.050 --> 53:24.550
Finish all engines.

53:24.700 --> 53:26.400
One thing, though.
What are we supposed to say to 'em?

53:26.500 --> 53:28.650
Are you serious, man?
Come on, get in the game.

53:28.850 --> 53:30.200
- Get in the game.
- They don't even speak english, Dean.

53:30.300 --> 53:31.900
Well, there are some things

53:32.000 --> 53:34.400
everybody does in the same language.

53:34.500 --> 53:36.200
Yeah, how are you supposed
to make the first move?

53:36.400 --> 53:47.500
Well...

53:39.200 --> 53:40.500
Be bold.

53:42.700 --> 53:45.000
How're you doin', ladies? Dean Preston.

53:47.700 --> 53:49.000
- Mrs. Jensen?
- Jensen.

53:49.100 --> 53:51.000
- Welcome.
- Yes.

53:51.050 --> 53:53.900
The girls have been looking
forward to this for some time.

53:54.000 --> 53:55.000
- Hello.
- Hello.

53:55.100 --> 53:57.100
- This is my wife Alice.
- How do you do?

53:57.300 --> 53:59.800
Shay, help these ladies on board.

54:00.000 --> 54:02.700
I think we're going to have
a wonderful sail tomorrow.

54:02.850 --> 54:08.200
You might have your girls dress,
you know, casual.

54:09.000 --> 54:11.350
Thank you, captain. They will.

54:11.450 --> 54:14.000
This is Gerard, our chef.

54:16.200 --> 54:17.400
Welcome!

54:23.600 --> 54:26.700
Ladies, this area of the ship is the bow.

54:26.900 --> 54:30.200
This is the foremast and
the foremast fife rail with pins,

54:30.350 --> 54:33.500
holding lines we use to control
the sails along the foremast.

54:33.650 --> 54:36.050
There are sheets used to set the sails,

54:36.250 --> 54:39.550
and there are clew lines
used to haul the sails back in.

54:39.700 --> 54:44.300
Every line along the fife rail
serves a specific purpose.

54:45.550 --> 54:48.600
The ship beneath you is not a toy, ladies.

54:48.800 --> 54:51.550
Respect that, and we'll all do fine.

54:51.700 --> 54:53.500
lf you'll follow me this way.

55:01.650 --> 55:04.300
So, one full turn of the wheel
is indicated by the kingspoke,

55:04.450 --> 55:07.050
which is this right here...

55:07.200 --> 55:08.400
Ladies!

55:08.550 --> 55:11.000
The wheel, all right?

55:12.150 --> 55:15.500
Then... That's...

55:31.000 --> 55:33.600
And she was a woman!

55:40.300 --> 55:42.800
Keep it up, Frankie. Come on.

55:43.650 --> 55:45.400
Ahoy there!

55:45.500 --> 55:48.000
Surprise! Surprise!

55:48.100 --> 55:49.200
Frank!

55:51.200 --> 55:53.450
Oh, Frank!

55:54.000 --> 55:56.000
Well, well! What do we have here?

55:56.200 --> 55:58.000
Good afternoon, captain.

55:58.200 --> 56:00.500
This is my wife, Mrs. Beaumont.

56:00.700 --> 56:03.400
- Hello.
- Hello. Pleasure to meet you.

56:03.500 --> 56:07.000
We thought that we would drop by
and see if you were all still in one piece.

56:07.100 --> 56:08.700
And of course we are.

56:08.800 --> 56:11.550
Well, you never can tell, can you?

56:13.450 --> 56:15.350
What can we do for you today?

56:15.550 --> 56:18.500
Oh, we just thought we'd give our
little boy a break from the monotony.

56:19.050 --> 56:21.000
It's not monotonous.

56:23.450 --> 56:24.600
Nevertheless.

56:24.700 --> 56:27.700
Now, come on! Hop to, boy!
We haven't got all day.

56:29.100 --> 56:31.300
What's this?

56:35.000 --> 56:38.500
All right, gentlemen.
Best behavior, please.

56:38.700 --> 56:41.900
We sail with the tide.
That's 6:00 a.m, sharp.

56:43.250 --> 56:44.650
Are you listening to me?

56:44.800 --> 56:46.500
Tracy, what time are we leaving?

56:46.650 --> 56:47.550
- 6 o'clock.
- All right.

56:47.750 --> 56:50.300
Have a good time, but don't be late.

56:55.600 --> 56:57.300
Thanks, dad.

57:01.700 --> 57:03.650
- Please come in.
- Thank you.

57:03.800 --> 57:05.700
It's magnificent.

57:22.950 --> 57:25.500
It's got lots of rum in it.

58:10.300 --> 58:13.550
Frank!

58:14.000 --> 58:17.000
Hey! What's wrong?

58:17.650 --> 58:20.000
You don't like steak?

58:21.500 --> 58:22.900
I should be eating with the crew.

58:23.000 --> 58:24.000
Well, you're not. You're eating with us.

58:24.100 --> 58:27.000
So, sit up, humor me and eat your steak.

58:42.000 --> 58:44.700
- Why did you come here?
- Why am I here?

58:44.800 --> 58:46.700
We missed you, sweetheart.

58:46.850 --> 58:48.400
Why in the Sam Hill do you think I'm here?

58:48.500 --> 58:50.300
We just wanted to check on you. That's all.

58:50.400 --> 58:51.700
Stay out of this.

58:52.550 --> 58:54.350
I don't need you spying on me.

58:54.550 --> 58:56.850
- Spying?
- Frank!

58:57.050 --> 58:58.850
Thanks a lot, son.

58:59.050 --> 59:02.000
- I can take care of myself.
- Oh, really?

59:02.300 --> 59:04.300
I can't wait for that, son.

59:04.800 --> 59:06.700
You put me on this stupid boat
in the first place.

59:06.900 --> 59:08.100
I didn't want to go, but I did.

59:08.200 --> 59:09.200
- Why do you have to embarrass me?
- Shut up!

59:09.300 --> 59:11.500
- Why can't you just leave me alone?
- Frank!

59:12.800 --> 59:15.000
You come outside with me.

59:15.100 --> 59:16.950
- But, Francis--
- Stay here.

59:25.400 --> 59:27.200
It's all right.

59:34.800 --> 59:37.350
Frank!

59:38.250 --> 59:39.700
Get your hands off me!

59:40.500 --> 59:42.000
- Settle down.
- Francis, let go of him.

59:42.500 --> 59:43.700
Let go of me!

59:44.000 --> 59:45.000
Francis, just...

59:45.200 --> 59:47.850
Take your hands off of him!

59:48.200 --> 59:50.000
Francis, you're hurting him! Now, stop it!

59:50.150 --> 59:51.250
You hear me?

59:51.350 --> 59:54.500
And don't you dare ever talk to me like that.

59:55.850 --> 59:58.100
Francis! My god!

59:59.050 --> 01:00:01.050
My god!

01:00:01.200 --> 01:00:03.000
Now, Frank.

01:00:04.500 --> 01:00:06.000
Frank!

01:00:11.500 --> 01:00:14.000
Oh, Christ!

01:00:14.300 --> 01:00:17.350
What is the matter with you?

01:00:23.400 --> 01:00:25.000
You wanna dance?

01:00:25.350 --> 01:00:27.000
Yeah, yeah.

01:00:37.700 --> 01:00:41.400
I can't ever remember feeling
this way about myself,

01:00:41.550 --> 01:00:45.000
or a place, or someone like you.

01:00:47.250 --> 01:00:50.000
We've come such a long way
and we've seen so many things,

01:00:50.150 --> 01:00:53.600
but... this is...

01:00:56.550 --> 01:00:57.950
What?

01:01:08.150 --> 01:01:13.400
I'm not so great at expressing myself.

01:01:13.600 --> 01:01:16.500
And maybe the only reason
I can do it right now

01:01:16.650 --> 01:01:19.950
is because I know you don't
understand a word I'm saying.

01:01:48.100 --> 01:01:50.000
Right.

01:01:50.500 --> 01:01:54.650
Roger Maris steps up to the plate!

01:02:00.700 --> 01:02:03.500
It's a corker down the pipe!

01:02:04.300 --> 01:02:06.450
It's outta here!

01:02:06.600 --> 01:02:09.550
Frank, what's going on? Frank!

01:02:09.750 --> 01:02:11.400
Come on!

01:02:11.550 --> 01:02:15.200
- It's a corker down the pipe!
- Frank, what's going on?

01:02:16.050 --> 01:02:18.800
Frank! Frank, what the hell are you doing?

01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:20.300
It's outta here!

01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:23.200
Talk to me. Tell me what happened.

01:02:32.100 --> 01:02:34.900
I just don't cut the mustard.

01:02:35.500 --> 01:02:36.700
Let's go.

01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:39.750
I don't hold up under scrutiny.

01:02:41.750 --> 01:02:44.400
Chuck!

01:02:48.600 --> 01:02:51.000
- Gieg!
- What?!

01:02:53.100 --> 01:02:55.200
Oh, you...

01:02:55.350 --> 01:02:57.750
Double-time it, man. Frank's in trouble.

01:03:00.500 --> 01:03:03.000
I gotta go. I'm sorry.

01:03:03.200 --> 01:03:05.000
I'll see you.

01:03:06.100 --> 01:03:07.500
Come on.

01:03:09.950 --> 01:03:12.350
Tod, come dance.

01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:17.000
One, two, three, four.

01:03:19.650 --> 01:03:21.300
Hey, buddy, how're you don'?

01:03:21.400 --> 01:03:23.650
You know you're gonna
work for me someday.

01:03:23.800 --> 01:03:26.000
Frank, why don't we go? Why don't we go?

01:03:26.100 --> 01:03:27.900
Let me go! I was invited too, man!

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:29.700
- Look at these guys. They're homos.
- Frank, we're gonna go.

01:03:29.900 --> 01:03:31.000
Get off me!

01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:34.850
I'm fine, all right?

01:03:38.500 --> 01:03:41.600
- Frank, stop doing that!
- What are you guys, homos?

01:03:41.700 --> 01:03:43.950
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!
We gotta go. Calm down.

01:03:44.100 --> 01:03:46.000
lf you don't calm down,
I'm gonna have to hurt you.

01:03:46.150 --> 01:03:47.900
It's okay. It's okay. We got you.

01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:49.500
Get him up.

01:03:49.700 --> 01:03:51.300
Get him outta here.

01:04:11.200 --> 01:04:13.500
Do you remember the last time
you and I danced?

01:04:13.700 --> 01:04:16.000
And you're gonna tell me again anyway.

01:04:16.200 --> 01:04:18.200
It was on the deck of the Yankee

01:04:18.350 --> 01:04:20.500
the night you asked me to marry you.

01:04:20.650 --> 01:04:22.900
I wasn't much older than they are.

01:04:24.650 --> 01:04:27.050
- Shall we?
- I don't wanna.

01:04:28.950 --> 01:04:30.700
Okay.

01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:40.000
May l?

01:04:50.500 --> 01:04:54.200
Don't slip, captain.
Your students are watching.

01:04:54.350 --> 01:04:57.000
Gotta get my sea legs here.

01:05:00.700 --> 01:05:02.000
Coming about. You ready?

01:05:02.100 --> 01:05:03.300
I'm ready.

01:05:07.350 --> 01:05:11.000
You know, Sheldon, sometimes,
not often, you act almost half human.

01:05:11.100 --> 01:05:13.700
I am halfway human.

01:05:19.200 --> 01:05:21.500
Look at those two over there.

01:05:38.250 --> 01:05:41.900
"Much have I traveled in realms of gold.

01:05:42.050 --> 01:05:45.900
"And many goodly states
and kingdoms seen

01:05:46.050 --> 01:05:49.350
"'Round western islands I've been,

01:05:49.550 --> 01:05:53.900
which bards in fealty to Apollo hold."

01:05:54.100 --> 01:05:56.400
Do you know what he's talking about here?

01:05:56.600 --> 01:05:59.350
Ah, humllity!

01:05:59.550 --> 01:06:02.350
He's saying he has traveled
the seas as Homer did,

01:06:02.500 --> 01:06:04.800
as Ulysses before him.

01:06:04.950 --> 01:06:07.150
"That deep-browed Homer."

01:06:07.300 --> 01:06:10.450
Brilliant, seasoned, wise of the mind.

01:06:10.650 --> 01:06:14.500
He commands the voyage
of the imaglnation,

01:06:14.850 --> 01:06:16.450
like a god.

01:06:16.650 --> 01:06:19.000
Piss on Homer, sir. We're livin' it.

01:06:20.500 --> 01:06:22.100
That's the spirit, Dean.

01:06:22.300 --> 01:06:23.800
Dolphins off the stern!

01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:25.900
Dolphins! Okay, come on!

01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:28.000
Come on! Look, there's one over there!

01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:30.300
Beautiful!

01:06:31.950 --> 01:06:34.000
- Oh, wow!
- This is incredible!

01:06:34.500 --> 01:06:36.300
Oh, she's beautiful!

01:07:27.300 --> 01:07:29.850
What the hell, guys?

01:07:30.200 --> 01:07:33.200
What happened? What's going on?

01:07:40.700 --> 01:07:43.200
Guide her alongside. That's it.

01:07:44.450 --> 01:07:47.000
All right, ease her away.

01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:52.800
- Bring the nose up onto the sled.
- Okay.

01:07:53.250 --> 01:07:55.100
- Dean, watch the spear.
- All right.

01:07:55.300 --> 01:07:57.300
Haul away.

01:07:58.200 --> 01:08:00.600
Easy. Easy.

01:08:00.750 --> 01:08:02.850
Tighten it off, Tim.

01:08:19.300 --> 01:08:21.500
All right, ease away.

01:08:24.250 --> 01:08:26.300
Easy.

01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:29.000
Keep it coming.

01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:35.000
What do you think?

01:08:39.200 --> 01:08:41.600
He's punctured her lung.

01:08:43.050 --> 01:08:45.250
Nice shot.

01:08:59.200 --> 01:09:00.399
Finish it.

01:09:03.300 --> 01:09:04.700
Man, I'm not gonna kill it.

01:09:04.899 --> 01:09:07.399
You already have. Go on, do it.

01:09:14.649 --> 01:09:16.000
No way.

01:09:34.200 --> 01:09:35.700
What the helI's wrong with you?

01:09:35.800 --> 01:09:36.800
Back off, man!

01:09:36.899 --> 01:09:38.399
You wanna kill something so bad?!

01:09:38.500 --> 01:09:40.450
It's just a fish! It's just a fish!

01:09:40.649 --> 01:09:43.300
Come on, let's see what you've got!

01:09:45.899 --> 01:09:48.250
That's what I thought.

01:09:50.050 --> 01:09:52.800
You're done here. You're going home.

01:10:03.350 --> 01:10:05.050
The guy's gone ballistic, all right?

01:10:05.250 --> 01:10:06.900
I'm telling you, he's gone mentally insane.

01:10:07.100 --> 01:10:08.850
It's like cabin fever or something like that.

01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:10.550
All right, man. Enoughm enough.
It's still not right.

01:10:10.700 --> 01:10:12.300
They shouldn't be putting him off the boat.

01:10:12.450 --> 01:10:15.050
- Look, the guy's outta control.
- We've all been out of control.

01:10:15.200 --> 01:10:17.550
But we're a crew. No, wait, wait.

01:10:17.700 --> 01:10:20.200
That's what this whole thing
is supposed to be about.

01:10:20.400 --> 01:10:23.550
Yeah, you're the last person that should be
whining about us being a crew right now.

01:10:23.700 --> 01:10:24.950
Oh, yeah? And how do you figure that?

01:10:25.150 --> 01:10:27.200
Well, I'd love to go into the subject
of vertigo and everything,

01:10:27.400 --> 01:10:29.550
but I wouldn't want you
to go and piss your pants.

01:10:29.750 --> 01:10:31.250
You know what I'm sayin'?

01:10:31.400 --> 01:10:33.250
- Oh, yeah, Stacy?
- Yeah.

01:10:33.450 --> 01:10:35.350
Come on!

01:10:35.500 --> 01:10:37.600
Get... Stop it!

01:10:38.100 --> 01:10:40.050
You're a real jerk, you know that?

01:10:40.200 --> 01:10:43.000
Tell it to the dolphin, Preston.

01:10:43.500 --> 01:10:46.200
He deserves another chance.

01:10:46.500 --> 01:10:49.500
We'd do the same for you, you know that.

01:10:49.600 --> 01:10:52.800
You do whatever you want, Gil, all right?

01:10:53.250 --> 01:10:55.650
It's not gonna make any difference anyway.

01:11:01.150 --> 01:11:04.350
- The dolphin was a symptom.
- Of what?

01:11:04.500 --> 01:11:07.050
Of a fight he can't win out here.

01:11:07.750 --> 01:11:10.650
- But, sir, it's his father.
- It's his father, sir.

01:11:10.800 --> 01:11:13.350
Oh, it's his father.

01:11:13.500 --> 01:11:15.450
He sent him down here. All of them.

01:11:15.600 --> 01:11:17.200
They sent us down here,

01:11:17.500 --> 01:11:20.950
because they want us to change
or grow up or something.

01:11:21.100 --> 01:11:23.250
And all they do is try
and keep us the same.

01:11:23.400 --> 01:11:25.200
I mean, he has all these expectations

01:11:25.350 --> 01:11:26.900
about who his son should be,

01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:28.700
and he doesn't even know who Frank is.

01:11:28.800 --> 01:11:30.600
How do you think you got here?

01:11:30.750 --> 01:11:32.350
Do you think they owe you something?

01:11:32.500 --> 01:11:35.600
Do you think they enjoy riding
subways and commuter trains,

01:11:35.750 --> 01:11:38.200
the same repetition day in and day out

01:11:38.300 --> 01:11:41.300
just to keep you in tennis shoes
and private school?

01:11:42.300 --> 01:11:44.800
You know, there are ground rules in families

01:11:44.950 --> 01:11:46.800
just like on this ship.

01:11:46.950 --> 01:11:49.000
You can understand that.

01:11:53.950 --> 01:11:56.200
Does Frank know how you guys feel?

01:11:57.800 --> 01:11:59.800
I don't know.

01:12:00.900 --> 01:12:03.450
Well, somebody should tell him.

01:12:04.400 --> 01:12:06.000
That's it.

01:12:18.650 --> 01:12:21.150
Well, I'm all ears.

01:12:21.350 --> 01:12:23.100
You may not like what you hear.

01:12:23.350 --> 01:12:24.650
Oh, I can take it.

01:12:25.650 --> 01:12:27.450
Chris, they've become what we wanted.

01:12:27.600 --> 01:12:30.700
They're a crew. That's why they came.

01:12:31.350 --> 01:12:33.600
Do you remember why we began this?

01:12:33.750 --> 01:12:36.450
Self-reliance and discipline
to the community of sailing.

01:12:36.600 --> 01:12:38.700
- I haven't forgotten.
- Mmm. Community.

01:12:38.850 --> 01:12:41.250
That boy doesn't know
the meaning of the word.

01:12:41.850 --> 01:12:44.400
So, the best thing you can do
is to keep him right here.

01:12:44.550 --> 01:12:46.150
He has a lot of problems.

01:12:46.300 --> 01:12:48.350
Well, he better start to learn
to deal with them.

01:12:49.500 --> 01:12:51.600
Oh, captain compassionate speaks.

01:12:51.800 --> 01:12:53.150
It's not about compassion.

01:12:53.250 --> 01:12:54.500
It's not about what happens here.

01:12:54.600 --> 01:12:56.000
It's about what they take away with them.

01:12:56.100 --> 01:12:58.100
- He was coming around.
- He was coming apart!

01:12:58.450 --> 01:12:59.850
He lost control out there!

01:13:00.050 --> 01:13:02.800
And what is so important
about being in control?

01:13:02.950 --> 01:13:04.900
He's just gonna have to figure that out,
isn't he?

01:13:05.050 --> 01:13:07.400
I'm not talking about him.

01:13:21.550 --> 01:13:24.300
<i>We watched in silent protest.</i>

01:13:24.500 --> 01:13:27.650
<i>Aboard ship, the low morale
was matched only by the feeling</i>

01:13:27.800 --> 01:13:31.300
<i>that maybe skipper was no different
than our own fathers back home.</i>

01:13:32.950 --> 01:13:35.350
<i>We'll miss Frank.</i>

01:13:39.550 --> 01:13:41.200
Jesus!

01:14:08.150 --> 01:14:10.900
Yeah, I'm... sorry.

01:14:21.750 --> 01:14:24.200
Frankie!

01:14:27.850 --> 01:14:30.400
Bye-bye!

01:14:34.900 --> 01:14:37.000
Bye, Frankie!

01:14:48.800 --> 01:14:51.450
Bye, buddy!

01:14:52.450 --> 01:14:55.150
They never gave up on you, you know.

01:14:59.550 --> 01:15:02.000
Bye, Frankie!

01:15:41.600 --> 01:15:43.550
I got a problem, man.

01:15:43.700 --> 01:15:45.000
We all have problems.

01:15:45.100 --> 01:15:48.500
No. A big problem.

01:15:51.200 --> 01:15:53.350
I'm pissing fire.

01:15:54.050 --> 01:15:55.150
Fire?

01:15:57.000 --> 01:15:58.100
Fire.

01:16:05.550 --> 01:16:07.500
Had a good time in Grenada, did you, Tod?

01:16:07.700 --> 01:16:10.950
Yeah. I did, actually. Thanks for askin'.

01:16:11.800 --> 01:16:13.900
Turn around.

01:16:28.600 --> 01:16:31.000
Hold that.

01:16:31.400 --> 01:16:32.600
Next!

01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:39.950
Robert! Drop your pants.

01:16:43.250 --> 01:16:45.000
Way to go, Valentlno.

01:16:45.200 --> 01:16:47.150
I never even copped a feel in Grenada.

01:16:47.300 --> 01:16:50.800
Yeah, well, your sexual orientation
is not my problem.

01:16:56.850 --> 01:16:58.400
What do you make of it, skipper?

01:16:58.500 --> 01:17:00.700
"Venceremos".

01:17:00.850 --> 01:17:03.100
Cubans.

01:17:03.450 --> 01:17:05.900
I'll get the horn.

01:17:07.200 --> 01:17:10.000
Jesus, she's got guns!

01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:13.200
Get down! Everybody down!

01:17:16.650 --> 01:17:18.450
Run up the colors.

01:17:18.650 --> 01:17:19.900
We're Americans, damn it!

01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:22.200
- Shay!
- Run up the colors!

01:17:24.750 --> 01:17:26.700
Jesus Christ! Are they gonna sink us?

01:17:26.850 --> 01:17:30.950
- Take in all sail! Do it now!
- Sails down! Get going! Go on!

01:17:38.500 --> 01:17:40.000
Here's the horn, skipper.

01:17:40.100 --> 01:17:42.100
Who the hell do they think they are?

01:17:48.700 --> 01:17:50.500
They want us to identify ourselves.

01:17:51.200 --> 01:17:55.400
Tell them we're the american
school ship, Albatross.

01:17:55.500 --> 01:17:58.450
Use your best Puerto Rican accent.

01:18:06.700 --> 01:18:08.950
They think we're carrying
cuban refugees, captain.

01:18:09.100 --> 01:18:11.000
I don't think they're going to take it
very lightly that I'm a cuban national.

01:18:11.100 --> 01:18:13.000
Nothing's going to happen.

01:18:13.100 --> 01:18:15.250
Remind them that according
to the Geneva convention

01:18:15.450 --> 01:18:18.500
firing on citizens on the high seas
is an act of war.

01:18:25.100 --> 01:18:28.150
They say they're acting on
the direct order of Fidel Castro.

01:18:39.800 --> 01:18:41.600
Tell them to come aboard.

01:18:41.750 --> 01:18:44.000
Do it, come on!

01:18:48.400 --> 01:18:50.600
- Give me your passport. Give it to me.
- I don't think--

01:18:50.700 --> 01:18:51.700
Come on, do it!

01:18:52.600 --> 01:18:54.400
You've come a long way, gentlemen,

01:18:54.600 --> 01:18:57.050
but this is no time for heroes.

01:18:57.250 --> 01:18:59.750
I need you to be boys right now.
That's an order.

01:19:01.400 --> 01:19:03.550
Get below, find your passports,

01:19:03.700 --> 01:19:05.000
bring them on deck.

01:19:05.100 --> 01:19:06.400
- All right, let's go.
- On the double!

01:19:06.500 --> 01:19:08.600
Let's go find those little bits.

01:19:12.600 --> 01:19:15.000
On deck right now! Come on,
get your stuff! Go, go, go, go!

01:19:15.100 --> 01:19:16.650
Don't worry. Nothing's gonna happen.
Come on!

01:19:16.800 --> 01:19:18.250
Preston, got it? Let's go. Get outta here.

01:19:18.400 --> 01:19:20.500
- Trace, come on! Trace!
- Damn it!

01:19:20.600 --> 01:19:22.000
- What?
- I can't find my passport.

01:19:23.200 --> 01:19:24.400
Oh, no!

01:19:24.550 --> 01:19:25.500
What is this? Is this your stuff here?

01:19:25.600 --> 01:19:26.850
Jesus, what a...!

01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:28.200
Come on, we gotta go. Come on!

01:19:28.350 --> 01:19:29.700
- Don't worry about it. Let's go!
- I can't find my passport!

01:19:29.800 --> 01:19:33.750
Now, damn it! Come on!

01:19:49.850 --> 01:19:52.100
He's Puerto Rican.

01:19:54.600 --> 01:19:58.000
You know, captain,

01:20:00.000 --> 01:20:04.000
playing cat and mouse is not very smart.

01:20:04.100 --> 01:20:05.850
Not for the mouse.

01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:09.600
Do you know you're violating
international law by boarding my ship?

01:20:09.700 --> 01:20:11.700
But you invited us.

01:20:11.850 --> 01:20:14.000
That's bullshit, man!

01:20:14.400 --> 01:20:16.450
Your cannons made a compelling argument.

01:20:18.200 --> 01:20:19.700
It's okay. He's got one.

01:20:19.800 --> 01:20:21.650
- I've got a passport. I swear to god.
- Stowaway?

01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:25.750
He left his passport in Grenada.
It's being mailed to him in Panama.

01:20:25.900 --> 01:20:27.800
I left it last time we boarded.

01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:30.950
That is unfortunate.

01:20:35.100 --> 01:20:36.950
We'll have to take him with us.

01:20:37.100 --> 01:20:39.350
- No!
- No!

01:20:39.500 --> 01:20:41.650
All right, all right, all right.

01:20:41.800 --> 01:20:44.000
lf he's Cuban, Castro wears a dress!

01:20:44.150 --> 01:20:45.500
All right.

01:20:45.800 --> 01:20:48.150
Now we've seen what
you can do with a boy.

01:20:48.300 --> 01:20:51.150
How would you like to go
a few rounds with a grown-up?

01:20:54.200 --> 01:20:57.050
None of my crew is leaving this ship.

01:21:06.050 --> 01:21:08.150
7th cavalry.

01:21:12.600 --> 01:21:14.350
What are you looking at?

01:21:14.450 --> 01:21:17.100
You want to take a souvenir, you take me.

01:21:34.400 --> 01:21:38.500
All right, that's it. Let's move, gentlemen.

01:21:44.150 --> 01:21:47.650
Now you will really have something
to teach your students, captain.

01:21:47.800 --> 01:21:54.100
Las estrellas es lo unico que
un marinero necesita para navegar.

01:22:02.100 --> 01:22:03.400
What'd he say?

01:22:03.600 --> 01:22:07.950
He says a real sailor only needs
the stars to navigate with.

01:22:15.200 --> 01:22:18.700
<i>And so he guided us silently
through the convoy of warships.</i>

01:22:18.850 --> 01:22:21.900
<i>And we later learned they were bound
for a little-known destination</i>

01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:24.100
<i>called the Bay of Pigs.</i>

01:22:24.250 --> 01:22:26.600
<i>As we rode the trades,
he shared the ancient secrets</i>

01:22:26.700 --> 01:22:30.300
<i>of how to read the waves
and follow the stars.</i>

01:22:30.500 --> 01:22:34.250
<i>Panama and the Americas
rose and fell away again.</i>

01:22:42.400 --> 01:22:45.350
<i>With the locks of Miraflores
and a continent behind us,</i>

01:22:45.500 --> 01:22:48.050
<i>we entered into a new ocean and a new world</i>

01:22:48.200 --> 01:22:51.050
<i>that we would stake and clalm as our own.</i>

01:22:51.200 --> 01:22:53.300
All right, pens down.

01:22:54.150 --> 01:22:56.400
Time's up. Leave your papers.

01:22:56.800 --> 01:22:59.200
Congratulations, gentlemen.

01:22:59.350 --> 01:23:02.900
All hands may go ashore, if you please.

01:23:03.750 --> 01:23:05.950
- You're on your own. Be careful.
- Yes! Yes!

01:23:06.600 --> 01:23:08.800
Buzzer's gone off, Dean.

01:23:11.900 --> 01:23:13.800
<i>We had traveled over 6,000 miles</i>

01:23:14.000 --> 01:23:16.800
<i>and slipped past the equator
to the very edge of the earth.</i>

01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:19.950
<i>Like Darwin before us,
we would see the bliss of nature</i>

01:23:20.100 --> 01:23:22.350
<i>in the absence of man.</i>

01:23:22.500 --> 01:23:25.700
<i>It was as if the albatross
had taken us to another time.</i>

01:23:26.400 --> 01:23:30.650
<i>Today I finally understand Homer.
The journey's the thing.</i>

01:24:40.400 --> 01:24:42.000
There should be a pencil in there.

01:24:42.800 --> 01:24:44.000
Hold that.

01:24:55.750 --> 01:24:58.650
"Where we go one, we go all.

01:25:00.200 --> 01:25:02.450
"Brigantine Albatross.

01:25:02.600 --> 01:25:04.550
"1961."

01:25:04.700 --> 01:25:06.650
That about says it all, huh?

01:25:08.950 --> 01:25:11.500
- Get in there, guys.
- Chuck Gieg.

01:25:11.650 --> 01:25:14.300
Tod Johnstone.

01:25:19.250 --> 01:25:22.050
Gil Martin.

01:25:22.800 --> 01:25:25.500
Dean Preston.

01:25:26.150 --> 01:25:28.300
Tracy Lapchick.

01:25:36.300 --> 01:25:38.500
What are they doing?

01:25:40.100 --> 01:25:42.650
Claiming their place in the world.

01:25:44.650 --> 01:25:46.950
Why didn't you go?

01:25:47.500 --> 01:25:51.300
- I couldn't. It's my watch.
- Mm-mm. I could've stayed.

01:25:55.200 --> 01:25:57.800
Listen, you hear that?

01:25:58.000 --> 01:25:59.000
What?

01:25:59.900 --> 01:26:02.950
The sound of an empty ship.

01:27:01.900 --> 01:27:03.500
How're you doing?

01:27:05.700 --> 01:27:08.000
Okay. How'd you do?

01:27:08.950 --> 01:27:11.750
730 verbal, 610 math.

01:27:12.750 --> 01:27:15.000
- Congratulations.
- What about you?

01:27:27.000 --> 01:27:29.100
It's 1100!

01:27:30.200 --> 01:27:32.450
Dean, you got an 1100! That's great!

01:27:32.600 --> 01:27:35.400
- I know.
- You know?

01:27:35.600 --> 01:27:37.650
I just can't believe it, you know?

01:27:38.250 --> 01:27:39.750
I couldn't have done it
without you guys, though.

01:27:39.900 --> 01:27:42.150
- I really couldn't.
- You did.

01:27:42.350 --> 01:27:45.050
This is you, Dean.

01:27:45.200 --> 01:27:46.950
All you. Nobody else.

01:27:47.950 --> 01:27:49.500
Thank you.

01:27:52.450 --> 01:27:54.250
You're welcome, stupid.

01:27:56.000 --> 01:27:57.300
I'm just testing.

01:27:57.850 --> 01:28:00.750
When are you gonna learn,
you little wise ass?

01:28:01.550 --> 01:28:03.050
- Here.
- Thanks.

01:28:03.200 --> 01:28:05.050
Feels different, doesn't it?

01:28:05.250 --> 01:28:06.450
What?

01:28:08.500 --> 01:28:09.700
Going back.

01:28:14.700 --> 01:28:16.400
I don't want it to end.

01:28:16.600 --> 01:28:21.100
I don't wanna be what I was when I left.

01:28:22.600 --> 01:28:24.000
What was that?

01:28:25.400 --> 01:28:26.700
Anonymous.

01:28:32.550 --> 01:28:34.200
I've been acing tests my whole life

01:28:34.400 --> 01:28:40.000
and I still haven't figured it out.

01:28:40.200 --> 01:28:42.200
Figured what out?

01:28:42.350 --> 01:28:44.000
Who I am.

01:28:44.150 --> 01:28:46.050
Are you kidding?

01:28:46.200 --> 01:28:48.600
I'll tell you who you are.

01:28:49.450 --> 01:28:50.650
Glue.

01:28:50.850 --> 01:28:55.950
You're the glue that holds
everyone around you together.

01:29:00.400 --> 01:29:02.450
Think I'm gonna choke on the "feel good".

01:29:38.250 --> 01:29:40.000
<i>...on this pilot. He needs help.</i>

01:29:40.100 --> 01:29:43.000
<i>There goes the umbilical cord
from the Redstone rocket.</i>

01:29:45.550 --> 01:29:47.400
How are you, Robert?

01:29:48.550 --> 01:29:49.900
<i>We're into the two-minute point,</i>

01:29:50.000 --> 01:29:55.000
<i>and at this point in the spacecraft
all the interior cameras are started.</i>

01:29:55.600 --> 01:29:56.900
<i>Two minutes and counting.</i>

01:29:57.400 --> 01:29:59.900
<i>Everything is working fine at the moment.</i>

01:30:00.050 --> 01:30:03.200
<i>The radio mikes are now on
in the space capsules.</i>

01:30:03.300 --> 01:30:06.100
- <i>Shepard can talk to control.</i>
- Here we go!

01:30:07.100 --> 01:30:10.100
- Good luck, huh?
- <i>One minute and 30 seconds to blast-off,</i>

01:30:10.200 --> 01:30:13.300
<i>if no further holds bother us at this point.</i>

01:30:16.500 --> 01:30:20.100
<i>The Mercury control count of the last
minute you will hear in just a moment,</i>

01:30:20.200 --> 01:30:22.500
<i>but I notice that the cherry picker
is being moved through,</i>

01:30:22.700 --> 01:30:24.700
<i>and we are coming up to...</i>

01:30:25.250 --> 01:30:26.900
- The morning watch?
- <i>We are coming up to...</i>

01:30:27.050 --> 01:30:28.400
- Below.
- <i>...the final countdown,</i>

01:30:28.500 --> 01:30:30.500
<i>which you will hear in ten-second breaks.</i>

01:30:30.600 --> 01:30:33.150
<i>We have just passed the 92nd mark.</i>

01:30:33.300 --> 01:30:35.600
<i>The cherry picker, the safety device...</i>

01:30:39.000 --> 01:30:40.600
"If you can keep your head

01:30:40.700 --> 01:30:43.750
"while all about you are losing theirs,
and blaming it on you.

01:30:43.950 --> 01:30:46.250
"lf you can trust yourself
when all men doubt you,

01:30:46.400 --> 01:30:50.100
"but make allowance for their doubting too."

01:30:50.300 --> 01:30:53.200
Morning watch is on!

01:30:53.900 --> 01:30:56.950
"Yours is the earth and everything in it,

01:30:57.100 --> 01:31:00.550
"which is more, you'll be a man, my son."

01:31:01.000 --> 01:31:03.100
okay!

01:31:05.400 --> 01:31:07.400
You have fun.

01:31:09.000 --> 01:31:11.000
Sweet dreams, Martin.

01:31:11.700 --> 01:31:13.000
<i>The air has been cut off.</i>

01:31:13.100 --> 01:31:16.000
<i>It is now automatically isolated
from the rest of the atmosphere.</i>

01:31:16.100 --> 01:31:17.500
<i>It has its own.</i>

01:31:17.700 --> 01:31:20.700
<i>The test conductor in the space
control center has taken over.</i>

01:31:26.000 --> 01:31:29.000
Bill, Bob, Tim, Charlie, go aloft!

01:31:29.500 --> 01:31:32.000
Get those latches closed!

01:31:36.400 --> 01:31:37.500
Morning, Shay.

01:31:39.100 --> 01:31:40.350
Hey, Tracy.

01:31:41.650 --> 01:31:44.550
- Would you trim the main, please?
- Trimming the main!

01:31:45.700 --> 01:31:47.850
- North by west.
- North by west.

01:31:48.000 --> 01:31:51.200
Get out of here, Bob.
Let the real men take over.

01:31:52.150 --> 01:31:54.200
- Looks like we're gonna get wet.
- Yeah, we need it.

01:31:54.500 --> 01:31:57.000
I'm gonna take a nice long bath,
catch some water for my laundry.

01:31:57.100 --> 01:31:58.700
Save some for me, will you buddy, huh?

01:31:58.850 --> 01:32:01.050
Yeah. Yeah, you got it.

01:32:02.000 --> 01:32:04.200
Going below!

01:32:11.050 --> 01:32:12.200
Everybody okay?

01:32:12.300 --> 01:32:15.000
All hands, keep out of the rigging!

01:32:18.100 --> 01:32:20.500
Stay clear of the masts!

01:32:23.850 --> 01:32:25.900
All right, gentlemen. Thor's had his fun.

01:32:26.100 --> 01:32:28.000
Let's keep a sharp eye.

01:32:42.500 --> 01:32:47.050
<i>We're coming up to countdown,
which goes in five seconds.</i>

01:32:50.450 --> 01:32:52.400
No, Shay! Dog her down!

01:32:52.500 --> 01:32:54.500
- Stay out of the rigging!
- Dog her down!

01:33:12.500 --> 01:33:14.550
Batten down all hatches!

01:33:27.900 --> 01:33:29.500
Skipper!

01:33:38.300 --> 01:33:39.500
White squall.

01:33:39.700 --> 01:33:41.250
Hold tight!

01:33:42.800 --> 01:33:44.700
Hold tight!

01:34:02.700 --> 01:34:04.300
Shay!

01:34:05.000 --> 01:34:07.100
We're losing it!

01:34:07.250 --> 01:34:09.950
Turn it over!

01:34:10.400 --> 01:34:12.000
Look out!

01:34:24.100 --> 01:34:26.500
<i>...agonizingly slowly...</i>

01:34:31.800 --> 01:34:34.000
Get outta here!

01:34:35.400 --> 01:34:36.500
Help!

01:34:37.000 --> 01:34:38.100
No!

01:34:40.400 --> 01:34:42.000
Tod!

01:34:51.000 --> 01:34:54.850
Tod! Tod! Turn to port!

01:35:01.700 --> 01:35:05.400
Turn to port! Turn to port!

01:35:05.500 --> 01:35:08.200
No! Starboard! Starboard!

01:35:08.350 --> 01:35:10.850
- No, Tod! Port!
- Port!

01:35:11.050 --> 01:35:14.100
Port, damn it! Turn to port!

01:35:21.200 --> 01:35:23.000
Look out!

01:35:33.550 --> 01:35:37.000
Leave it, Tod! Get out!

01:35:40.550 --> 01:35:42.650
Back! Back!

01:35:42.800 --> 01:35:45.250
Come on, Tod. Grab on!

01:35:45.400 --> 01:35:47.350
Grab on!

01:35:51.350 --> 01:35:53.100
Come on!

01:35:53.250 --> 01:35:56.350
Gil, come on. Let's go. Let's get outta here.

01:35:56.850 --> 01:35:59.750
Now, Gil! Come on!

01:36:06.500 --> 01:36:07.700
Come on, let's go.

01:36:08.200 --> 01:36:10.900
Everybody out! Keep moving!

01:36:15.100 --> 01:36:17.000
We've lost her!

01:36:17.700 --> 01:36:20.000
- Free the staysail.
- Yes, sir!

01:36:20.250 --> 01:36:23.800
- Free the staysail!
- Grab a lifeboat.

01:36:30.600 --> 01:36:32.000
Skipper!

01:36:35.600 --> 01:36:38.550
Come on, out! Out this way!

01:36:50.000 --> 01:36:51.500
Get out!

01:36:52.000 --> 01:36:55.600
Anybody in here?

01:37:09.650 --> 01:37:11.500
Hey!

01:37:13.300 --> 01:37:15.400
Get them outta there.

01:37:26.800 --> 01:37:29.000
Shay!

01:38:21.750 --> 01:38:26.400
Gerard!

01:38:30.050 --> 01:38:32.000
Shay!

01:38:33.200 --> 01:38:35.500
Shay!

01:38:40.850 --> 01:38:43.300
Gerard!

01:39:02.300 --> 01:39:05.000
Alice!

01:39:12.400 --> 01:39:15.800
Get back, guys! Get back!
She's gonna roll!

01:39:16.450 --> 01:39:18.500
Get in the lifeboat, now!

01:39:19.400 --> 01:39:20.600
Hold on.

01:39:58.150 --> 01:40:00.600
Gerard!

01:40:01.000 --> 01:40:04.100
- Dean!
- Yeah! Yeah, over here.

01:40:06.150 --> 01:40:09.800
Sahler! Marsh! Gil!

01:40:10.650 --> 01:40:13.400
- Gil!
- Where's Gil?

01:40:13.600 --> 01:40:17.450
Help!

01:40:21.700 --> 01:40:25.000
One, two, three. wake up.

01:40:25.200 --> 01:40:27.750
- Where's Alice?
- I think they're inside.

01:40:27.900 --> 01:40:29.500
Come on!

01:40:33.700 --> 01:40:36.950
No! Stay back! She's rolling!

01:41:25.100 --> 01:41:27.200
She's down there!

01:41:32.750 --> 01:41:34.700
Gil!

01:41:39.000 --> 01:41:41.500
Skipper, I'll try forward.

01:41:43.250 --> 01:41:45.900
Gil!

01:41:46.000 --> 01:41:48.400
Gil, you gotta get outta here.
She's going down!

01:41:48.500 --> 01:41:51.250
There's something down there
blocking the door!

01:41:51.450 --> 01:41:54.200
Get me out of here, Chuck.
Come on, get me out, please!

01:42:02.250 --> 01:42:04.500
Come on, Chuck. I want out.

01:42:09.350 --> 01:42:12.000
Gil, Gil, I can't move it.
You gotta push harder.

01:42:12.150 --> 01:42:14.700
Gil, push from your side! Gil!

01:42:15.150 --> 01:42:18.300
Gil, push harder from your side!

01:42:18.900 --> 01:42:21.450
Chuck! Chuck! Chuck!

01:42:21.600 --> 01:42:23.850
We gotta go, Chuck! Come on!

01:42:24.200 --> 01:42:27.350
She's going down.
Come on, Chuck! Let's go!

01:42:27.500 --> 01:42:31.000
Gil, you've gotta push from your side.

01:42:45.650 --> 01:42:48.600
No, Gil!

01:42:49.050 --> 01:42:50.850
Chuck, we've gotta go!

01:42:51.000 --> 01:42:53.600
Help me get this door!

01:43:04.400 --> 01:43:07.800
It's too late! It's going over!

01:43:08.450 --> 01:43:10.800
Skipper, it's too late!

01:43:11.000 --> 01:43:13.250
- We can't stay on.
- Get off the ship!

01:43:13.450 --> 01:43:14.500
Get them in the boat!

01:43:14.600 --> 01:43:17.200
- Do it!
- All right, skipper.

01:43:34.200 --> 01:43:37.400
Oh, please!

01:45:09.000 --> 01:45:10.500
Dean!

01:46:03.500 --> 01:46:08.600
<i>Gerard, Alice, Dean, Gil.</i>

01:46:08.800 --> 01:46:11.000
<i>Today I hate the sea.</i>

01:46:11.150 --> 01:46:13.800
<i>It will never look the same again.</i>

01:46:21.200 --> 01:46:23.000
Look.

01:46:31.050 --> 01:46:34.000
Shepard.

01:47:11.000 --> 01:47:14.050
Skipper! Skipper! Skipper, look! Look!

01:47:18.050 --> 01:47:20.300
McCrea!

01:48:15.500 --> 01:48:17.000
Captain Sheldon, can you
give us a statement?

01:48:17.500 --> 01:48:20.250
What the hell went on out there?

01:48:34.950 --> 01:48:37.050
Do you have anything to say
to these parents?

01:48:37.200 --> 01:48:38.850
Yes, and it's private.

01:48:44.200 --> 01:48:47.000
- Son!
- Dad?

01:49:19.500 --> 01:49:21.300
Thought we'd find a store.

01:49:21.450 --> 01:49:25.000
Get you fixed up then...
get you something to eat.

01:49:25.750 --> 01:49:27.950
Sound good?

01:49:34.550 --> 01:49:37.550
Hey! Your size right on top. Here.

01:49:42.250 --> 01:49:45.850
Why don't you take these in the
back there and see how they fit?

01:49:48.600 --> 01:49:50.450
Ma'am, do you have boxer shorts?

01:49:50.650 --> 01:49:52.500
- Right over there, sir.
- Okay.

01:50:16.000 --> 01:50:20.000
<i>Come on! Chuck, grab my arm!
Grab my arm!</i>

01:50:26.500 --> 01:50:28.000
Chuck, you okay in there?

01:50:31.850 --> 01:50:34.200
I'm sorry.

01:50:34.400 --> 01:50:36.950
We'll be right back for the clothes.

01:50:42.800 --> 01:50:45.000
- They'll try and take his license.
- Why?

01:50:45.100 --> 01:50:47.100
'Cause they need it to be simple.

01:50:47.300 --> 01:50:48.500
They need a reason.

01:50:48.600 --> 01:50:51.100
- Who?
- All of them.

01:50:51.300 --> 01:50:53.000
Everyone on that dock.

01:50:53.100 --> 01:50:54.550
So, what are we supposed to do?

01:50:54.750 --> 01:50:56.800
Tell them what we know, the truth.

01:50:57.000 --> 01:51:00.100
- I mean, that's what he'd want.
- The truth!

01:51:01.000 --> 01:51:03.450
We went over in a squall.
What's wrong with that?

01:51:05.200 --> 01:51:07.450
Everybody knows why we went over, Tod.

01:51:07.700 --> 01:51:10.800
It wasn't from the squall.
You jibed the boat.

01:51:10.950 --> 01:51:12.600
Look, I was trying to get her upwind, all right?

01:51:12.700 --> 01:51:14.100
I mean, that's what you're supposed to do!

01:51:14.200 --> 01:51:15.650
That's not what the skipper thought.

01:51:15.850 --> 01:51:17.350
Not when you got the squares up.

01:51:17.500 --> 01:51:19.600
He was trying to spill out
the air from the main.

01:51:19.750 --> 01:51:21.400
It was coming four poonts off the bow, Tracy.

01:51:21.600 --> 01:51:22.700
It never would've gotten--

01:51:22.850 --> 01:51:23.900
Were you on the deck?!

01:51:24.000 --> 01:51:25.650
Because I was standing right there!

01:51:25.800 --> 01:51:27.800
And all I know is that Tod
disobeyed an order twice!

01:51:27.950 --> 01:51:28.900
Look, it didn't--

01:51:29.000 --> 01:51:30.000
That's when the boat went over.

01:51:30.100 --> 01:51:32.000
It didn't go over until I turned her port!

01:51:32.200 --> 01:51:34.700
Man, you're all missing the point, anyway.

01:51:34.850 --> 01:51:36.500
This is because of Frank.

01:51:36.700 --> 01:51:38.100
Frank and dear old dad.

01:51:38.200 --> 01:51:39.650
What are you talking about?

01:51:39.800 --> 01:51:44.200
I'm talking about, they're here,
staying at the damn Rhett House.

01:51:44.300 --> 01:51:46.100
I mean, how do you think
this thing got put together so fast?

01:51:46.200 --> 01:51:49.350
The old man's been out
for skipper since day one.

01:51:49.550 --> 01:51:51.700
The skipper booted his kid off the boat!

01:51:51.800 --> 01:51:53.300
What did you expect?

01:51:53.450 --> 01:51:56.300
I told you he was a turncoat
the day we kicked him off, man.

01:51:57.500 --> 01:51:59.100
Damn kid!

01:52:22.900 --> 01:52:25.000
Frank?

01:52:27.800 --> 01:52:28.800
Frank!

01:52:28.900 --> 01:52:30.200
Can we talk?

01:52:33.050 --> 01:52:35.000
Yeah, I guess.

01:52:36.100 --> 01:52:37.200
What are you doing here?

01:52:37.300 --> 01:52:39.200
Frank, who are you talking to?

01:52:39.400 --> 01:52:42.050
Yeah, it's all right. I'll be in in a minute.

01:52:44.300 --> 01:52:46.000
What do you want?

01:52:46.800 --> 01:52:49.200
Everyone's saying that...

01:52:49.700 --> 01:52:53.450
that this whole tribunal is happening
because of your old man.

01:52:53.650 --> 01:52:55.150
And because of you.

01:52:55.300 --> 01:52:57.000
Is that true?

01:52:57.150 --> 01:52:58.600
It's just typical, isn't it?

01:52:58.750 --> 01:53:01.500
- Well, is it true, Frank?
- I gotta go.

01:53:01.600 --> 01:53:04.300
Frank, he was not out on that ship!

01:53:04.450 --> 01:53:06.800
And he doesn't know what happened.
Frank, you don't know what happened!

01:53:06.950 --> 01:53:11.000
- I know enough!
- Frank, please!

01:53:12.600 --> 01:53:15.250
Frank, get him to call it off.

01:53:18.200 --> 01:53:20.450
I'm sorry.

01:53:22.150 --> 01:53:24.000
Wait.

01:53:28.000 --> 01:53:30.000
What is this?

01:53:30.850 --> 01:53:33.250
You do what you've gotta do, Frank.

01:53:36.800 --> 01:53:39.000
The United States Coast Guard

01:53:39.200 --> 01:53:42.200
has been asked to conduct
this maritime hearing

01:53:42.400 --> 01:53:46.900
to consider the revocation
of captain Christopher Sheldon's

01:53:47.000 --> 01:53:49.300
U.S. master seaman's certificate.

01:53:50.800 --> 01:53:53.450
All right, captain Sanders, you may begin.

01:53:59.050 --> 01:54:01.500
The Albatross.

01:54:01.650 --> 01:54:04.750
By all accounts, a sound vessel.

01:54:05.500 --> 01:54:09.700
An experienced captain, an able crew.

01:54:09.850 --> 01:54:13.400
And yet it lies out there on the bottom

01:54:13.550 --> 01:54:16.750
in 2,000 fathoms with its back broken.

01:54:17.700 --> 01:54:22.100
There are serious questions that
demand our most serious consideration,

01:54:22.250 --> 01:54:25.500
so that we might understand,
so that perhaps

01:54:25.700 --> 01:54:30.000
we may prevent such a sad event
from ever taking place again.

01:54:31.000 --> 01:54:33.100
A freak accident?

01:54:33.300 --> 01:54:37.050
A one in a million meteorological anomaly?

01:54:37.200 --> 01:54:42.000
Or was it inexperience? Misjudgment?

01:54:42.400 --> 01:54:46.100
Negligence? We'll see.

01:54:53.200 --> 01:54:55.000
Please.

01:55:06.200 --> 01:55:08.000
- Thank you.
- Captain, Sheldon...

01:55:08.500 --> 01:55:11.100
Captain Sheldon, would you consider
yourself a good judge of character

01:55:11.300 --> 01:55:12.450
when it came to the boys?

01:55:12.600 --> 01:55:13.700
Yes.

01:55:14.000 --> 01:55:15.700
And it would be important,
would it not, in your position

01:55:15.800 --> 01:55:18.150
to have some sense of their
strengths and weaknesses?

01:55:18.350 --> 01:55:19.750
Yes, of course.

01:55:19.900 --> 01:55:23.900
Do you recall an incident
involving Gil Martin?

01:55:24.800 --> 01:55:26.750
What incident would you be referring to?

01:55:26.900 --> 01:55:30.100
Well, is it true that you forced
Gil Martin to climb the mast

01:55:30.250 --> 01:55:33.100
when it was clear that he was acrophobic?

01:55:33.250 --> 01:55:35.250
He climbed when he was ready.

01:55:35.450 --> 01:55:38.450
Were you aware that
his brother was killed in a fall?

01:55:38.650 --> 01:55:40.300
Yes, I was.

01:55:40.500 --> 01:55:43.600
sir, were you aware at any time
of the use of alcohol among your crew?

01:55:43.700 --> 01:55:44.950
Yes, I was.

01:55:45.100 --> 01:55:47.600
- You didn't do anything about it?
- No, I did not.

01:55:47.750 --> 01:55:51.050
Had you ever seen a white squall
before this incident?

01:55:51.700 --> 01:55:53.100
No.

01:55:53.300 --> 01:55:56.200
And what makes you so sure it was one?

01:55:56.700 --> 01:55:58.850
I can't be sure.

01:55:59.000 --> 01:56:02.000
You really felt that your crew
was up to the conditions?

01:56:02.450 --> 01:56:07.000
we had come 12,000 miles together
through every kind of seas imaginable.

01:56:07.200 --> 01:56:08.900
Except a white squall.

01:56:09.000 --> 01:56:11.650
Now, with all due respect,
captain, they're only boys.

01:56:14.800 --> 01:56:17.800
They're much more than that, sir.

01:56:18.450 --> 01:56:20.700
ls it true the reason
you expelled Frank Beaumont--

01:56:20.900 --> 01:56:23.200
For killing a dolphin.

01:56:23.800 --> 01:56:25.800
And that you invited him to strike you,

01:56:25.900 --> 01:56:28.700
to fight it out on the deck of the ship?

01:56:32.900 --> 01:56:34.850
Yes, that is true.

01:56:35.050 --> 01:56:38.600
So, you allowed the use of alcohol,
among other things, to go unpunished

01:56:38.800 --> 01:56:43.100
and yet you expelled this boy
for killing a fish.

01:56:43.300 --> 01:56:46.450
- A mammal.
- A mammal.

01:56:50.150 --> 01:56:51.900
It would appear to me sir,
with all due respect,

01:56:52.100 --> 01:56:55.350
that your stewardship
as captain of the Albatross

01:56:55.500 --> 01:56:59.600
could be characterized
as reckless, unbalanced,

01:56:59.700 --> 01:57:02.700
with no discipline whatsoever.

01:57:04.500 --> 01:57:06.000
Do you find this funny?

01:57:08.400 --> 01:57:10.000
Some kind of joke?

01:57:11.000 --> 01:57:15.050
I don't think one second of this is funny, sir.

01:57:17.050 --> 01:57:18.850
The national weather service
says white squalls

01:57:19.050 --> 01:57:21.550
are a meteorological phenomenon
of the imaglnation.

01:57:21.700 --> 01:57:23.200
What do you say to that?

01:57:23.300 --> 01:57:26.050
What happened to my ship
was not imagined.

01:57:26.200 --> 01:57:29.050
It was not a dream, sir.

01:57:29.300 --> 01:57:32.000
No, captain Sheldon, it was not.

01:57:33.100 --> 01:57:35.300
It was a nightmare.

01:57:37.700 --> 01:57:40.200
Now, Shay, I need you to help me out.

01:57:40.400 --> 01:57:42.800
On the day of the accident,

01:57:42.950 --> 01:57:46.500
do you remember where you were
when the lightning first struck?

01:57:47.400 --> 01:57:51.100
I was on deck. Midships.

01:57:52.050 --> 01:57:56.650
During this squall that ensued,

01:57:57.000 --> 01:57:59.050
why didn't you drop any sail?

01:57:59.200 --> 01:58:01.500
Skipper called us out of the rigging.

01:58:01.650 --> 01:58:05.350
But your instinct was to lose sail?

01:58:05.550 --> 01:58:09.900
Skipper's instinct was to not
get any any of us electrocuted.

01:58:16.150 --> 01:58:18.000
How old are you, son?

01:58:19.700 --> 01:58:21.450
15.

01:58:25.200 --> 01:58:27.650
And you were the first mate
of the Albatross, is that correct?

01:58:27.800 --> 01:58:30.750
I am the first mate of the Albatross.
That's correct.

01:58:32.500 --> 01:58:35.400
And are you a professional sailor, son?

01:58:41.250 --> 01:58:43.750
No, I'm not a professional sailor.

01:58:50.800 --> 01:58:54.050
You say you turned hard to
starboard when the gust hit.

01:58:54.200 --> 01:58:56.850
I thought we'd have a better chance,
if I headed into the wind.

01:58:57.000 --> 01:58:59.500
But the captain ordered you hard to port.

01:59:00.050 --> 01:59:01.400
- Twice.
- I'm sorry?

01:59:01.500 --> 01:59:03.000
Twice!

01:59:03.300 --> 01:59:05.450
Is that what you were trained to do?

01:59:06.500 --> 01:59:07.900
No.

01:59:08.000 --> 01:59:09.200
Speak up, son. I can't hear you.

01:59:09.300 --> 01:59:10.400
I said no.

01:59:10.500 --> 01:59:13.000
And what did you think he was trying to do?

01:59:13.550 --> 01:59:15.650
Put her off.

01:59:15.800 --> 01:59:17.600
To let the blow drive the boat downwind.

01:59:17.700 --> 01:59:19.600
By the "blow" you're referring
to the force of the storm, is that right?

01:59:19.700 --> 01:59:22.200
Let the blow drive the boat downwind,

01:59:22.350 --> 01:59:24.050
and neutralize our canvas.

01:59:24.200 --> 01:59:26.900
So when the captain gave you
an order contrary to your training,

01:59:27.000 --> 01:59:29.500
you thought he was making a mistake.

01:59:31.750 --> 01:59:33.000
No.

01:59:33.150 --> 01:59:35.350
Then why son?

01:59:35.500 --> 01:59:38.050
Why didn't you follow his order?

01:59:38.450 --> 01:59:40.650
Because...

01:59:43.700 --> 01:59:45.100
I panicked.

01:59:45.200 --> 01:59:47.700
You know that's not true, Tod!

01:59:52.200 --> 01:59:54.000
Do you believe he panicked?

01:59:54.500 --> 01:59:56.000
What the hell is he doing?

01:59:56.350 --> 01:59:57.950
Quiet, please.

02:00:00.000 --> 02:00:02.750
Maybe you can't see what's
happening here, but I can.

02:00:04.250 --> 02:00:06.450
Tod, I appreciate what
you're trying to do here.

02:00:06.600 --> 02:00:09.350
Maybe you could live with it, but I couldn't.

02:00:10.000 --> 02:00:12.150
lf you think I'm gonna let
a 17-year-old take responsibility,

02:00:12.250 --> 02:00:14.150
then you underestimate me.

02:00:14.350 --> 02:00:18.850
The Albatross was my ship.
The Ocean Academy was my school.

02:00:19.000 --> 02:00:22.150
Her responsibility is mine and mine alone.

02:00:32.450 --> 02:00:36.000
I can't bring your sons back.

02:00:37.300 --> 02:00:41.800
If you want my ticket,
if that will ease your pain,

02:00:42.750 --> 02:00:45.800
that's the least that I can do.

02:00:55.600 --> 02:00:58.600
- This, this is easy.
- Captain sheldon!

02:01:00.200 --> 02:01:01.950
- Captain!
- No.

02:01:02.150 --> 02:01:04.000
- Order, please, order.
- This proceeding is not over, captain.

02:01:04.100 --> 02:01:07.000
- I still have further questions for this witness.
- No.

02:01:07.200 --> 02:01:08.500
Order!

02:01:08.800 --> 02:01:11.300
Don't you walk out on us, skipper! You don't!

02:01:15.500 --> 02:01:18.000
You tell me, was it all just a lie?

02:01:18.300 --> 02:01:21.000
Was it? Because we listened
to you, we believed you!

02:01:21.200 --> 02:01:23.300
And we are still here!

02:01:24.850 --> 02:01:26.800
Bad things happen sometimes,

02:01:26.900 --> 02:01:29.000
and there's nothing
that you can do about it.

02:01:29.100 --> 02:01:33.050
It wasn't you. Or Tod. It wasn't you, Tod.

02:01:33.650 --> 02:01:36.750
It was all of us, everyone in this room.

02:01:36.900 --> 02:01:40.300
Because we all knew the risks
we were taking going out there.

02:01:40.400 --> 02:01:43.400
You paid our tuition, and you told us to go.

02:01:43.550 --> 02:01:47.000
So, why do we just have to invent
some reason now for why this happened?

02:01:47.100 --> 02:01:49.000
Just pin it on one person?

02:01:50.300 --> 02:01:51.700
Why?

02:01:55.500 --> 02:01:58.750
Then shame on you, skipper. Shame on you!

02:01:59.300 --> 02:02:02.000
Mr. Gieg.

02:02:05.000 --> 02:02:08.300
I was in command of the Albatross.

02:02:08.450 --> 02:02:11.400
And I was responsible for precious cargo.

02:02:13.250 --> 02:02:16.400
It was my job to get you all home safely

02:02:16.500 --> 02:02:18.000
with my knowledge and my skill.

02:02:18.150 --> 02:02:21.300
That's the contract that I made
with your parents.

02:02:21.400 --> 02:02:24.400
But something happened out there.
I lost control.

02:02:25.600 --> 02:02:29.650
Maybe just for an instant.
Maybe all along. I'm not sure.

02:02:29.850 --> 02:02:32.850
But I know this. I never saw it coming.

02:02:33.000 --> 02:02:37.350
It was like I just woke up,
and a hand came down

02:02:37.500 --> 02:02:40.700
and pushed my sails into the sea.

02:02:40.850 --> 02:02:43.700
It got away for me, the whole thing.

02:02:45.200 --> 02:02:47.900
And people died.

02:02:50.700 --> 02:02:55.000
Now, you're young and strong.

02:02:56.400 --> 02:02:58.000
Everything's ahead of you.

02:02:58.550 --> 02:03:00.600
You told us, "where we go one, we go all."

02:03:00.750 --> 02:03:05.050
Well, we believed you. We lived by it, sir.

02:03:05.200 --> 02:03:09.000
And now you're saying that
where you go, we can't follow.

02:03:10.050 --> 02:03:11.700
Mr. Gieg.

02:03:11.900 --> 02:03:17.950
The Albatross wasn't just a ship or a school.

02:03:19.300 --> 02:03:21.200
It was something that we made.

02:03:23.000 --> 02:03:24.750
Something that's inside of us.

02:03:27.450 --> 02:03:29.300
That's who you are, skipper.

02:03:29.500 --> 02:03:32.900
What you gave us. You carried us.

02:03:33.050 --> 02:03:37.700
Now, let us carry this together.
Let us carry this together.

02:03:38.750 --> 02:03:42.350
Let it go. Just go home.

02:04:57.600 --> 02:05:00.050
<i>They didn't take his ticket today.</i>

02:05:00.200 --> 02:05:03.150
<i>But I wonder if he'll ever go to sea again.</i>

02:05:03.350 --> 02:05:04.500
<i>I know one thing.</i>

02:05:04.650 --> 02:05:06.950
<i>If he did, we'd all go with him.</i>

02:05:07.100 --> 02:05:10.650
<i>To a man. No doubt. Not even a question.</i>

02:05:10.850 --> 02:05:15.000
<i>Today he joined the circle he created
by allowing us to share his burden.</i>

02:05:15.700 --> 02:05:19.500
<i>The burden of sea captains and fathers,</i>

02:05:19.700 --> 02:05:21.600
<i>the burden of men.</i>

02:05:21.750 --> 02:05:24.350
<i>In the end, it just comes down to one thing.</i>

02:05:24.500 --> 02:05:26.300
<i>You can't run from the wind.</i>

02:05:26.500 --> 02:05:30.700
<i>You face the music, you trim
your sails, and keep going.</i>
