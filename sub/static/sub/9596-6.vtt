00:00.452 --> 00:04.248
_

00:04.288 --> 00:05.636
There was war.

00:05.734 --> 00:08.602
We knew that there had been
people killed up there.

00:11.378 --> 00:12.478
But there was something

00:12.513 --> 00:14.580
just completely wrong
about this place.

00:18.151 --> 00:20.620
I never, ever believed
in ghosts before.

00:26.093 --> 00:28.227
Did we unleash something?

00:32.165 --> 00:33.743
Someone is trying to kill us.

00:35.202 --> 00:36.602
It's gonna be them or me.

00:37.971 --> 00:39.739
And it's sure as hell
not gonna be me.

00:39.773 --> 00:41.107
Let's go.

00:41.141 --> 00:42.729
What do you do?

00:42.762 --> 00:44.443
I mean, you have this gun

00:44.478 --> 00:45.878
and all this gear.

00:47.614 --> 00:49.615
But that's not
gonna help you now.

00:50.481 --> 00:51.717
Go, go, go, go!

00:53.854 --> 00:55.273
We're all about to die
right now.

01:15.409 --> 01:17.076
As commander in chief,

01:17.545 --> 01:20.914
I have determined that it is
in our vital national interest

01:20.948 --> 01:24.517
to send an additional 30,000
U.S. troops to Afghanistan.

01:24.817 --> 01:26.817
_

01:29.222 --> 01:30.923
I do not make this decision
lightly.

01:30.958 --> 01:33.426
I make this decision
because it is from here

01:33.460 --> 01:35.428
that we were attacked on 9/11,

01:35.462 --> 01:37.263
and it is from here
that new attacks

01:37.297 --> 01:39.231
are being plotted as I speak.

01:39.497 --> 01:44.246
_

01:44.771 --> 01:46.038
In the marines,

01:46.073 --> 01:49.141
you live, you breathe
with the guys you work with

01:49.176 --> 01:51.544
day in and day out.

01:51.578 --> 01:54.046
Some of the guys
had kids that were just born...

01:54.081 --> 01:55.181
Recently married,

01:55.215 --> 01:56.916
and this was
their first deployment.

01:56.950 --> 01:58.451
It was pretty hard on them.

02:00.422 --> 02:05.584
_

02:06.335 --> 02:09.410
_

02:10.518 --> 02:12.632
O.P. Rock
was my first assignment.

02:13.318 --> 02:14.735
It was just a kick in the face,
pretty much like, "hey,

02:14.768 --> 02:16.669
"you're gonna do this training
for a few months,

02:16.703 --> 02:18.738
and, boom, you're going
straight to Afghanistan."

02:19.694 --> 02:21.453
I don't even know
if I wanted to do this or not.

02:23.033 --> 02:27.150
_

02:27.514 --> 02:30.616
The squad was led
by Sergeant Green.

02:30.651 --> 02:32.184
I was his second in command.

02:32.816 --> 02:35.918
To be in charge of so many guys
is a burden.

02:37.320 --> 02:39.326
If there's a mistake
or decision you made

02:39.359 --> 02:41.560
and they pay the cost,

02:41.595 --> 02:43.696
that's a hard break to swallow.

02:50.003 --> 02:53.562
_

02:53.603 --> 02:54.399
All right.

02:54.440 --> 02:56.742
One of the British soldiers
came down to help us.

02:56.777 --> 02:58.044
Welcome to O.P. Rock.

03:01.915 --> 03:04.450
It looked like a giant rock,
just a, you know...

03:04.484 --> 03:06.185
It was pretty much just a knoll.

03:07.521 --> 03:09.055
Come on.

03:11.291 --> 03:13.893
It was definitely
a weird place,

03:13.927 --> 03:16.729
had a very strange vibe.

03:26.773 --> 03:28.741
The British soldiers
looked pretty rough.

03:28.775 --> 03:30.543
They looked a little razzled,

03:30.577 --> 03:33.345
a little bit fried.

03:33.380 --> 03:35.448
You can tell they've
been there for a long time

03:35.482 --> 03:37.383
and they're just ready to go
and go home.

03:41.054 --> 03:42.855
You didn't have any beds.
You didn't have any cots.

03:42.889 --> 03:44.557
You slept in the dirt.

03:44.591 --> 03:46.692
It was just really bare.

03:46.727 --> 03:48.127
Yeah, it sucked.

04:01.408 --> 04:02.875
There was this dog
that was up there.

04:02.909 --> 04:04.443
Hey, buddy.
Hey.

04:04.478 --> 04:06.545
And they said,
"oh, that's ugly Betty.

04:06.580 --> 04:08.781
We take care of her,
feed her."

04:08.815 --> 04:10.950
He goes, "you won't ever find
a more diligent sentry."

04:10.984 --> 04:12.318
Hey.

04:12.352 --> 04:14.653
Always a dog person growing
up, worked with animals,

04:14.688 --> 04:17.389
and I took it upon myself
to take care of her.

04:17.423 --> 04:19.291
She's cute.

04:19.326 --> 04:20.860
Betty, come on.

04:20.894 --> 04:22.561
Come on.

04:31.271 --> 04:33.672
Finally it was time
for the British soldiers to go.

04:35.742 --> 04:36.909
One more thing.

04:36.943 --> 04:38.811
The British soldiers
told us something crazy.

04:38.845 --> 04:40.079
If you dig anything up...

04:40.113 --> 04:41.280
Make sure you put it back
where you...

04:41.314 --> 04:42.948
Back where you found it,
all right?

04:42.983 --> 04:44.617
I was like,
"we don't know these guys.

04:44.651 --> 04:46.619
They're probably just, like,
jerking our chain."

04:46.653 --> 04:48.621
You know what I mean?

04:48.655 --> 04:51.090
It made no sense to us
at the time.

05:03.570 --> 05:06.406
Later that night,
I was on the machine gun post.

05:08.341 --> 05:10.663
It was very isolated.

05:11.578 --> 05:13.078
When you're in a small unit,

05:13.113 --> 05:16.782
there's always that fear
of being vastly outnumbered.

05:16.817 --> 05:20.886
Dragged away into the night
is always a possibility.

05:27.928 --> 05:29.361
Do you need anything, Corporal?

05:29.396 --> 05:30.796
Anytime Sergeant Green,
you know,

05:30.831 --> 05:31.897
would come up on the post,

05:31.932 --> 05:33.599
he would do
a very distinctive tap-tap

05:33.633 --> 05:35.801
on your shoulder
just to get your attention.

05:35.836 --> 05:36.936
No, I'm good.

05:36.970 --> 05:38.470
I told him
that everything was fine,

05:38.505 --> 05:40.172
he was good to rack out
for the night.

06:06.233 --> 06:08.734
It was a... it was
a crackling, gurgling noise

06:08.768 --> 06:11.170
that kept fading in and out.

06:19.079 --> 06:21.180
I immediately called
the main base.

06:21.214 --> 06:23.515
Golf main,
this is O.P. Rock.

06:23.550 --> 06:25.384
Did you send a transmission?
Over.

06:25.418 --> 06:26.452
They called back.

06:26.486 --> 06:27.853
That's a negative,
O.P. Rock.

06:27.888 --> 06:31.090
"We have not sent or received
any traffic at this time."

06:31.124 --> 06:32.443
Copy.

06:33.493 --> 06:35.094
It was just very unusual.

06:47.707 --> 06:49.108
I turn up the volume on it

06:49.142 --> 06:52.011
to see if I can kind of make out
what's being transmitted.

06:59.119 --> 07:00.152
It doesn't sound English.

07:03.056 --> 07:05.691
My immediate thought,
It was bad batteries.

07:05.725 --> 07:08.899
I grab a fresh battery,

07:09.529 --> 07:11.196
hope that's the end of it.

07:11.231 --> 07:12.298
This is our lifeline.

07:12.332 --> 07:14.800
We can't afford
to lose this radio.

07:14.834 --> 07:17.069
If someone
was to sneak up on us,

07:17.103 --> 07:18.370
we'd be done for.

07:20.407 --> 07:21.974
O.P. Rock,
this is golf main.

07:22.008 --> 07:23.876
Radio check, over.

07:24.978 --> 07:26.111
Roger, golf main.

07:26.146 --> 07:28.881
This is O.P. Rock.
Loud and clear, over.

07:29.916 --> 07:31.417
It was very unusual,

07:31.451 --> 07:33.819
but you can't really dwell
on what happened.

07:36.123 --> 07:38.510
_

07:43.096 --> 07:45.531
Observation posts
are usually pretty safe

07:45.565 --> 07:47.841
'cause you can see
for miles around.

07:48.335 --> 07:50.035
This was different, though.

07:50.070 --> 07:51.670
You felt somewhat exposed.

07:54.313 --> 07:56.481
Anytime your head
was popping over the side,

07:56.515 --> 07:59.651
chance that a sniper
is gonna get you.

07:59.685 --> 08:02.420
There were trenches in place,
but they weren't very deep.

08:02.455 --> 08:05.323
The British
had been here for a while.

08:05.357 --> 08:07.859
We couldn't figure out
why they had not dug in deeper.

08:09.762 --> 08:11.329
We immediately knew
that we needed to dig

08:11.363 --> 08:12.831
deeper and wider trenches.

08:14.919 --> 08:17.405
_

08:24.543 --> 08:25.577
I'm digging.
I'm digging.

08:25.611 --> 08:26.911
All of a sudden...

08:26.946 --> 08:27.912
Clang!

08:27.947 --> 08:29.280
I hit metal.

08:33.686 --> 08:36.421
It's some kind
of engineering stake.

08:36.455 --> 08:38.155
I brush it off,

08:38.190 --> 08:39.823
and I see there's
Russian lettering,

08:39.859 --> 08:41.860
very distinctive.

08:41.894 --> 08:43.160
It made sense.

08:43.195 --> 08:44.896
The Russians had been down here
back in the '80s.

08:44.930 --> 08:47.932
It wouldn't be surprising
even to find leftover gear

08:47.967 --> 08:49.467
from their time here.

08:52.872 --> 08:54.973
The ground was pretty hard.

08:55.007 --> 08:58.276
It was like trying to break
through rock.

08:58.310 --> 08:59.811
I poked a shovel
into the wall,

08:59.845 --> 09:02.113
and it collapsed on me.

09:02.148 --> 09:05.283
I noticed there was,
like, a little crevice.

09:05.317 --> 09:06.351
Hey, Smith.

09:11.457 --> 09:13.324
Lance Corporal Smith
started digging around.

09:21.400 --> 09:24.169
Oh.

09:26.071 --> 09:29.207
We found little pieces
of ceramic pots,

09:29.241 --> 09:31.276
little cups
and stuff like that.

09:34.847 --> 09:36.214
What is it?

09:36.248 --> 09:39.350
We went from being marines
to archaeologists

09:39.385 --> 09:41.319
or anthropologists or something.

09:45.791 --> 09:47.625
There was something else
down there...

09:47.660 --> 09:49.160
Just didn't know
exactly what it was.

10:03.876 --> 10:05.476
Hey, Lena.

10:05.511 --> 10:06.644
Make a wish.

10:10.449 --> 10:13.785
From the shape of it,
it's a femur bone.

10:13.819 --> 10:16.187
It was definitely,
definitely human.

10:16.222 --> 10:18.756
- You sure?
- Positive.

10:18.791 --> 10:21.593
Like, this is kind of creepy.

10:24.763 --> 10:26.598
- Ooh. Oh.
- Stop.

10:26.632 --> 10:28.399
Hey, put it back, man.

10:28.434 --> 10:30.602
Lance Corporal Smith was
definitely the practical joker.

10:30.636 --> 10:32.303
You know, he always wanted
to say something

10:32.338 --> 10:33.638
crazy and cruel.

10:33.672 --> 10:35.106
Oh, could you check...
Check my arm?

10:35.140 --> 10:37.375
I think something's wrong.
Guh! Ooh!

10:37.409 --> 10:39.010
- Come on, man.
- Oh. Ooh.

10:39.044 --> 10:40.278
- Come on.
- You got something...

10:40.312 --> 10:41.646
You got something.

10:41.680 --> 10:43.481
Seriously, man,
put it back.

10:43.515 --> 10:45.283
- Yeah, yeah.
- We're here to work.

10:45.317 --> 10:46.718
All right.

10:46.752 --> 10:48.920
We were kind of superstitious
about things like that,

10:48.954 --> 10:51.856
so we just put it back
where it belonged.

11:01.233 --> 11:02.600
But you couldn't dig anywhere

11:02.635 --> 11:04.569
without digging up
bone after bone.

11:06.872 --> 11:08.473
What the...

11:08.507 --> 11:09.641
There's another one.

11:09.675 --> 11:11.843
They were everywhere.

11:11.877 --> 11:13.511
Now it became very clear

11:13.545 --> 11:16.080
why the British
did not dig in deeper.

11:17.850 --> 11:20.184
There were bodies
buried underneath here.

11:23.022 --> 11:24.989
We're on top of a graveyard.

11:25.433 --> 11:28.259
_

11:45.611 --> 11:46.744
It was my 20th birthday.

11:46.779 --> 11:49.747
I was the most junior marine
on O.P. Rock.

11:49.782 --> 11:53.084
Being up there alone
with nothing to do

11:53.118 --> 11:54.852
just mentally drains you.

11:58.223 --> 12:00.191
It's an eerie silence.

12:00.225 --> 12:02.727
I grew up on a farm,
so I was used to the country,

12:02.761 --> 12:04.862
but it was deathly quiet.

12:16.809 --> 12:18.443
And I'm sitting there,
and all of a sudden,

12:18.477 --> 12:20.144
I just get
this unnerving feeling

12:20.179 --> 12:21.212
that I'm being watched.

12:29.421 --> 12:31.389
And it just sent chills
through my entire body.

12:39.064 --> 12:41.165
Aah!

12:41.200 --> 12:43.534
And I hear
this bloodcurdling scream.

12:51.164 --> 12:52.667
It's not good, guys.

12:52.700 --> 12:53.601
It's not good.

12:53.635 --> 12:57.171
_

13:01.119 --> 13:04.127
_

13:06.713 --> 13:08.880
I thought someone
got grabbed.

13:09.239 --> 13:10.643
This is our biggest fear,

13:10.676 --> 13:13.578
someone sneaking into camp,
grabbing us at night,

13:13.611 --> 13:14.710
and carrying 'em off.

13:26.490 --> 13:27.935
- Jeez!
- Hey.

13:28.526 --> 13:29.728
He was like,
"man, what was that?"

13:29.761 --> 13:31.229
And I was just like,
"I don't even know, man.

13:31.262 --> 13:32.664
It was just, like,
really creepy."

13:34.666 --> 13:36.067
Move.

13:36.100 --> 13:37.068
Go.

13:40.705 --> 13:41.940
I assumed
that it was a person

13:41.973 --> 13:45.276
that had got caught
in the wire.

13:49.513 --> 13:53.118
But I look around,
and there's nothing to be seen.

14:02.360 --> 14:03.628
I saw something move across

14:03.661 --> 14:06.231
right outside
our perimeter wire.

14:06.264 --> 14:09.134
We immediately went,
guns on ready,

14:09.167 --> 14:10.669
straight
to the little front entrance

14:10.702 --> 14:11.770
where our razor wire was,

14:11.803 --> 14:14.105
shined a flashlight out there,
looked.

14:14.138 --> 14:15.573
And I thought someone
is gonna try

14:15.606 --> 14:18.974
to either take a potshot at us
or throw a grenade into the O.P.

14:22.045 --> 14:24.416
I don't have a visual.

14:24.449 --> 14:25.750
So I grab the thermals.

14:27.218 --> 14:28.987
Thermal optics
would very clearly show

14:29.020 --> 14:31.790
anybody that was hiding
behind brush

14:31.823 --> 14:33.024
or hiding in the dirt.

14:34.325 --> 14:36.928
You can very clearly see
the shape from the body heat

14:36.961 --> 14:39.698
to tell if it's a person
or an animal.

14:46.637 --> 14:48.139
You sure you saw something,
Hoyt?

14:48.172 --> 14:50.041
With all the assets and gear
at our disposal,

14:50.074 --> 14:52.177
there was no way that someone
could have hidden from us

14:52.210 --> 14:53.511
and not be seen.

14:55.213 --> 14:56.987
I saw something.

14:57.515 --> 14:59.517
You're trying to put together
what you just heard,

14:59.550 --> 15:01.052
what caused that,
and, you know,

15:01.085 --> 15:02.787
you just don't have an answer.

15:03.070 --> 15:04.806
We'll take a look
in the morning.

15:05.356 --> 15:07.192
We just shrugged our shoulders
and went back to the post

15:07.225 --> 15:08.860
and acted like nothing
happened.

15:08.893 --> 15:09.968
Good night.

15:11.262 --> 15:13.031
I assumed
that it was just my mind

15:13.064 --> 15:15.861
playing tricks on me
because I was so tired.

15:15.931 --> 15:18.660
_

15:22.506 --> 15:23.675
So early next morning,

15:23.708 --> 15:26.878
I took Lance Corporal Parker
down with me.

15:26.911 --> 15:31.216
You always have a battle buddy
watching your back.

15:31.249 --> 15:33.985
Being outside the wire,
you feel very exposed

15:34.018 --> 15:35.587
for any kind of sniper attack,

15:35.620 --> 15:39.455
so we didn't want to spend
a whole lot of time out there.

15:52.003 --> 15:54.606
I immediately started looking
for some kind of rationalization

15:54.639 --> 15:56.207
for what had been there.

15:56.240 --> 15:57.408
An individual,

15:57.441 --> 15:58.843
or even an animal,
for that matter,

15:58.876 --> 16:00.512
would've left footprints.

16:05.816 --> 16:08.019
I could not find
any kind of prints,

16:08.052 --> 16:09.320
you know, man or beast,

16:09.353 --> 16:11.654
indicating that it
had been there previous night.

16:13.790 --> 16:15.593
So you start to wonder,

16:15.626 --> 16:17.593
"well, what was it?"

16:20.246 --> 16:22.246
_

16:31.042 --> 16:32.324
It was quiet out.

16:32.357 --> 16:33.378
It was still,

16:33.411 --> 16:37.580
and I was just reflecting
about, you know, life stuff.

16:40.417 --> 16:42.625
It would get so hot at night.

16:43.855 --> 16:45.390
It was very uncomfortable.

16:53.496 --> 16:54.997
Put your helmet on.

17:05.242 --> 17:07.910
Some hours pass after that.

17:13.951 --> 17:15.686
All of a sudden,
I feel, like, this cold chill

17:15.720 --> 17:17.553
move across me.

17:28.265 --> 17:29.500
There was no, like, breeze.

17:29.533 --> 17:32.670
There was no reason
why I would feel, like, cold

17:32.703 --> 17:33.802
all of a sudden.

17:35.038 --> 17:37.609
And then...
And I feel this breath

17:37.642 --> 17:39.210
on the side of my face.

17:42.246 --> 17:44.849
And I hear something whisper

17:44.882 --> 17:47.585
in my ear.

17:47.618 --> 17:48.951
I spun around.

17:52.622 --> 17:55.493
Nothing was there.

17:55.526 --> 17:56.794
The whisper...

17:56.827 --> 17:59.864
I mean,
it sounded like Russian.

17:59.897 --> 18:01.532
I thought,
"I'm just tired.

18:01.565 --> 18:03.668
You know,
I'm just stressed out."

18:03.701 --> 18:07.272
So I gaffed it off
as being that.

18:10.308 --> 18:12.543
I hear, like, a crunching noise.

18:12.576 --> 18:15.013
Sounded like footsteps
above me.

18:19.050 --> 18:21.686
There's definitely somebody

18:21.719 --> 18:24.756
walking above me.

18:24.789 --> 18:27.392
And I thought, "okay,
it's probably Smith."

18:27.425 --> 18:30.194
So I ran around real quick
to catch him

18:30.227 --> 18:31.462
on top of the post.

18:42.005 --> 18:43.072
Nobody was there.

18:45.675 --> 18:48.513
And that's when I started
getting spooked.

19:01.525 --> 19:02.827
And I'm looking around,

19:02.860 --> 19:06.764
and I'm, like, scanning around,
on top of the base.

19:06.797 --> 19:09.865
And nothing was there.

19:33.257 --> 19:35.360
And I see this figure

19:35.393 --> 19:36.661
in my sight.

19:48.270 --> 19:51.557
_

19:58.221 --> 20:01.488
_

20:01.529 --> 20:03.630
It looks like his fists
are balled.

20:04.933 --> 20:07.135
I was ready to shoot.

20:07.303 --> 20:11.206
I needed to make sure
it wasn't one of my boys.

20:17.613 --> 20:19.547
But when I looked
back through it...

20:26.004 --> 20:28.372
Gone.
Just gone.

20:47.092 --> 20:48.459
So I was like,
"are you kidding me, man?

20:48.493 --> 20:50.094
"I got to deal with the Taliban,

20:50.128 --> 20:52.830
"all the insects,
the IEDs,

20:52.864 --> 20:53.924
"the heat...

20:55.167 --> 20:58.803
And now I got to deal
with, like, spirits?"

21:05.944 --> 21:07.856
That's when I felt
that chill again.

21:09.181 --> 21:10.347
But what do you do?

21:10.382 --> 21:12.716
I mean, you have this gun
and all this gear

21:12.751 --> 21:14.485
and your training,

21:14.519 --> 21:16.220
but that's not
Goa he you now.

21:27.165 --> 21:28.265
What's up with you, man?

21:28.300 --> 21:30.267
When I got up
to relieve Damian on post,

21:30.302 --> 21:32.436
he started telling me
about strange things

21:32.471 --> 21:33.671
going on that night.

21:33.705 --> 21:35.052
There's something bad here,
man.

21:35.874 --> 21:37.274
I saw something.

21:37.802 --> 21:39.243
I took it
with a grain of salt

21:39.277 --> 21:41.212
'cause it's late,
you're tired.

21:41.246 --> 21:42.980
One of your senses
plays tricks on you.

21:52.057 --> 21:55.759
It's a lonely feeling knowing

21:55.794 --> 21:59.096
that this place is haunted
and you're the only one

21:59.130 --> 22:02.066
that sees these things
or hears these things.

22:02.100 --> 22:04.168
I'd rather, you know,
take my chances

22:04.202 --> 22:07.381
against something I could
actually, like, fight against.

22:08.746 --> 22:11.545
So after that,
I requested a transfer.

22:21.535 --> 22:23.416
We didn't know
what quite to make of it.

22:24.204 --> 22:25.705
If he wasn't strong enough
to be there,

22:25.739 --> 22:27.740
then I didn't quite want him
watching my back

22:27.774 --> 22:29.744
because then that's something
I can't trust.

22:29.884 --> 22:33.739
At the same time, you're down one man,
now that sucks for everybody else.

22:34.214 --> 22:36.682
He's playing
the crazy card, man.

22:51.665 --> 22:53.756
Copy that, golf main.
All clear here.

22:53.837 --> 22:55.033
How's your boys doing?

22:55.165 --> 22:58.104
Kickin' ass, O.P. Rock.
You know it? Hoorah.

22:58.138 --> 23:01.004
A few days after Zolik
had left O.P. Rock,

23:01.037 --> 23:02.875
I was on the machine gun post.

23:02.909 --> 23:05.544
It was about 1:30
in the morning.

23:08.983 --> 23:12.118
I hear Ugly Betty barking,
and instinctively,

23:12.152 --> 23:14.123
I throw up
my night vision goggles

23:14.156 --> 23:15.978
to see what she's barking at.

23:33.428 --> 23:35.529
I see something
in the distance.

23:40.568 --> 23:42.102
First thing
that goes through my mind,

23:42.136 --> 23:44.235
It's a scout for the Taliban.

23:45.106 --> 23:46.640
It was unnerving.

23:46.674 --> 23:49.309
I felt this figure
was staring right at me

23:49.344 --> 23:52.375
and knew I was staring
right back at it.

23:53.664 --> 23:56.750
At that distance, your eyes
can kind play tricks on you.

23:56.784 --> 24:00.020
I switched over
to my thermal optics.

24:10.164 --> 24:11.732
There's no animal activity,

24:11.766 --> 24:14.001
no creatures,
no people out there.

24:15.737 --> 24:18.205
So thinking that I had
made a mistake somehow,

24:18.239 --> 24:20.783
I switched back over
to my night vision goggles.

24:24.352 --> 24:25.240
I figured that it had moved

24:25.273 --> 24:26.736
a hundred meters closer

24:26.803 --> 24:28.803
in just a few seconds.

24:30.853 --> 24:33.181
It was teleporting to me.

24:34.925 --> 24:36.626
I thought
I must have gone crazy.

24:48.273 --> 24:49.706
Still nothing.
Field's cold.

24:49.741 --> 24:51.809
There's no body heat signatures.

24:58.990 --> 25:00.557
This whole time Ugly Betty

25:00.590 --> 25:02.892
is still barking
in that direction.

25:02.926 --> 25:05.534
So I look back
to where the figure is.

25:14.838 --> 25:16.038
And just then,

25:16.073 --> 25:18.634
I felt Sergeant Green's
signature double tap

25:18.667 --> 25:19.628
on my shoulder.

25:23.847 --> 25:24.814
Green?

25:25.105 --> 25:27.273
I know I felt
that double tap.

25:27.307 --> 25:30.977
It was so precise.

25:39.996 --> 25:40.930
Ahh!

25:50.689 --> 25:53.894
_

25:58.989 --> 26:00.356
And there's nobody there.

26:00.390 --> 26:02.024
They just vanished.

26:07.431 --> 26:10.466
I know I'm not crazy.
Ugly Betty was barking at it.

26:12.269 --> 26:13.869
It's not just me.

26:15.739 --> 26:19.241
I realized Zolik, you know,
was onto something,

26:19.276 --> 26:21.573
and he got out of there,

26:21.607 --> 26:22.707
and we're still here.

26:31.688 --> 26:33.289
What is my next step?

26:33.323 --> 26:35.658
You don't go running
to your command saying,

26:35.692 --> 26:38.894
"I've got ghosts
playing tricks on me on post"

26:38.929 --> 26:41.631
because that's gonna get you
a one-way ticket

26:41.665 --> 26:43.566
to the loony bin.

26:43.600 --> 26:44.624
You all right, sir?

26:45.669 --> 26:46.769
Yeah.

26:46.803 --> 26:48.237
Part of me kind of wished

26:48.271 --> 26:50.573
that someone else
might have the experience too.

27:01.428 --> 27:04.016
_

27:25.175 --> 27:26.576
It was the dead of the night.

27:26.610 --> 27:28.044
Everyone else is asleep.

27:28.078 --> 27:30.146
There's one other marine
that's awake,

27:30.180 --> 27:31.514
Lance Corporal Smith,

27:31.548 --> 27:33.883
who was 15 to 20 meters away
on a different post.

27:38.355 --> 27:40.533
I could hear, like,
footsteps behind me.

27:41.191 --> 27:42.625
Hey, Sarge.

27:46.512 --> 27:47.787
And there's nothing there.

27:50.133 --> 27:52.468
It was probably just
loose gravel falling.

28:04.383 --> 28:06.251
Ugly Betty
was just standing there

28:06.285 --> 28:08.586
with her hair up,

28:08.621 --> 28:10.021
teeth bared, growling.

28:12.458 --> 28:14.292
So I scanned with the thermals.

28:16.495 --> 28:18.263
The only heat signatures
up there

28:18.297 --> 28:21.066
were the dog
and the other marines sleeping.

28:23.803 --> 28:24.769
Smith.

28:26.672 --> 28:28.373
You see anything?

28:28.407 --> 28:29.596
And he said no.

28:33.179 --> 28:34.346
Try to shake it off.

28:34.380 --> 28:35.380
Do your job.

28:49.061 --> 28:52.397
And all of a sudden,
I just hear this crunch again.

28:58.404 --> 28:59.604
My body is telling me

28:59.638 --> 29:03.041
that something
just breathed on me.

29:03.075 --> 29:05.377
My skin is icy.

29:11.484 --> 29:13.752
I couldn't see anything,

29:13.786 --> 29:16.121
and it was like my eyes
were just lying to me

29:16.155 --> 29:18.523
because every other sense
in my body was sing,

29:18.557 --> 29:20.158
"no, there's something there."

29:33.761 --> 29:36.129
It was then that I really
accept the fact,

29:36.164 --> 29:39.032
that "You know what?
Damian was right.

29:39.067 --> 29:41.068
We were not alone up there."

29:41.839 --> 29:44.507
_

30:06.928 --> 30:09.696
I never, ever believed
in ghosts.

30:09.731 --> 30:11.498
There's no way, man.
There's no way that happened.

30:11.532 --> 30:12.933
Like, I don't believe
any of that stuff.

30:27.649 --> 30:29.416
And then out of nowhere,

30:29.450 --> 30:32.185
it was just like
this weird, cold chill.

30:53.531 --> 30:55.575
And then that's when I heard
the whispering.

30:59.253 --> 31:02.121
At first, it was just,
like, faint, like...

31:02.678 --> 31:04.679
Like, you can barely hear
what was going on.

31:07.145 --> 31:08.445
There was no one there.

31:18.090 --> 31:20.891
The voice came back again,

31:23.060 --> 31:24.628
That's Russian,

31:24.662 --> 31:26.363
but no Russians are here.

31:31.002 --> 31:32.441
And then it just got louder

31:32.474 --> 31:35.105
like the person was actually
touching me in the ear.

31:51.560 --> 31:53.962
And it was just so loud
in my head,

31:53.996 --> 31:56.231
and it just terrified me.

32:04.668 --> 32:06.374
- _
- Spades. Ha.

32:06.408 --> 32:09.700
- _
- Spade. Pick up five.

32:19.132 --> 32:21.267
Did something happen to you?

32:21.301 --> 32:23.474
We couldn't deny
that these things

32:23.507 --> 32:25.775
had happened to us
'cause it happened to all of us.

32:26.510 --> 32:28.044
I see them things too, man.

32:28.698 --> 32:30.213
Everybody was just like,
"yeah, man,

32:30.247 --> 32:32.197
I know exactly
what you're talking about."

32:33.150 --> 32:35.088
There's some weird stuff
going on.

32:36.202 --> 32:37.402
This is not something

32:37.437 --> 32:40.706
that we can just write off
as being heatstroke

32:40.740 --> 32:42.374
or being exhaustion.

32:42.408 --> 32:45.110
It was too many things
happening to all of us

32:45.145 --> 32:46.108
too many times.

32:46.141 --> 32:48.712
Felt breath
on the back of my neck.

32:48.745 --> 32:50.345
Heard whispers.

32:50.380 --> 32:51.980
It just became
common knowledge.

32:52.015 --> 32:55.484
There's no rationable
explanation here.

32:55.518 --> 32:57.052
I mean, at this point,
you have to look

32:57.086 --> 32:58.687
to the supernatural.

32:58.721 --> 33:00.355
Ghosts.

33:02.392 --> 33:03.892
You can't shoot it.
You can't stab it.

33:03.927 --> 33:04.927
You can't blow it up.

33:04.961 --> 33:06.261
You just have to accept the fact

33:06.296 --> 33:08.430
that these thing are happening

33:08.465 --> 33:10.499
and we need to continue
to do our job.

33:12.502 --> 33:13.936
How are you?

33:13.970 --> 33:16.390
The one person that seemed
most unaffected by it

33:16.424 --> 33:18.058
was Lance Corporal Smith.

33:18.093 --> 33:20.594
He used to give us
a bit of a hard time about it.

33:20.629 --> 33:22.503
"The sun fried your brain."

33:23.832 --> 33:25.165
But there was something

33:25.200 --> 33:27.268
just completely wrong
about this place.

33:27.302 --> 33:29.403
It's not the sun, guys.

33:29.437 --> 33:31.972
And it wasn't a matter,
you know,

33:32.064 --> 33:36.543
if something would happen.
Again, it was a matter of when.

33:36.949 --> 33:40.527
_

33:42.651 --> 33:44.618
This was our last night.

33:44.653 --> 33:48.422
We were so close to our goal
of getting out of there...

33:49.457 --> 33:50.879
We were all on edge.

33:52.427 --> 33:54.828
Lance Corporal Diggs
calls me over.

33:54.863 --> 33:56.654
Something going on
with the radio.

33:57.524 --> 33:59.524
There is a problem here.

33:59.771 --> 34:02.220
Well, I've changed out
the battery twice now...

34:02.418 --> 34:04.939
"And both of them
have gone dead

34:04.973 --> 34:06.941
within a ten-minute period."

34:06.975 --> 34:08.152
It just made no sense.

34:09.878 --> 34:12.313
So I grab the last good battery
we have.

34:12.347 --> 34:13.813
It's all we have left.

34:15.166 --> 34:16.556
Seems fine to me.

34:17.118 --> 34:18.452
Thanks.

34:22.824 --> 34:23.954
Corporal Lena.

34:23.987 --> 34:25.762
"Corporal Lena, radio's dead."

34:25.795 --> 34:27.895
The system is dead.

34:27.929 --> 34:29.897
Our means of
communication

34:29.931 --> 34:31.899
have now bee
completely severed.

34:34.069 --> 34:35.302
We're on our own.

35:29.424 --> 35:30.958
This is gonna happen again,
and I'm sitting here,

35:30.992 --> 35:32.393
waiting for that whisper.

35:41.403 --> 35:42.770
Bang, bang, bang,
bang, bang, bang.

35:45.106 --> 35:47.174
Holy hell, we're all
about to die right now.

35:49.177 --> 35:50.811
Someone finally got in.

35:50.845 --> 35:52.579
Someone is trying to kill us.

35:53.815 --> 35:54.948
We've been shot at before,

35:54.983 --> 35:57.284
but this is...
this is close.

36:00.388 --> 36:02.458
Time to go to work.

36:02.491 --> 36:03.457
It's gonna be them or me.

36:05.560 --> 36:08.095
And it's sure as hell
it's not gonna be.

36:11.499 --> 36:13.400
My heart was pounding
really hard-core.

36:15.570 --> 36:17.438
The machine gun fired
right next to my ear.

36:22.310 --> 36:23.343
- Wilson!
- Ah!

36:23.378 --> 36:24.511
What's going on?

36:27.348 --> 36:28.382
It wasn't misfire.

36:28.416 --> 36:29.249
What happened?

36:29.283 --> 36:30.851
It was very clear
that no rounds

36:30.885 --> 36:32.486
had been recently expelled
from the machine gun.

36:34.189 --> 36:35.155
Wilson.

36:35.190 --> 36:36.457
You okay?

36:36.491 --> 36:38.592
Then out of nowhere...

36:38.626 --> 36:40.527
Oh! Down!

36:40.562 --> 36:41.795
Definitely an RPG.

36:43.498 --> 36:46.366
You can just hear
the thump-thump, thump-thump

36:46.401 --> 36:47.434
of your heartbeat.

36:48.536 --> 36:49.503
I thought this was it.

36:49.537 --> 36:50.915
I thought I was done for.

36:53.942 --> 36:55.776
What's happening?

36:55.810 --> 36:57.111
Everyone started to try
to figure out

36:57.145 --> 36:58.314
where we were taking fire from.

36:58.347 --> 37:00.226
Diggs, check the trenches.

37:00.259 --> 37:02.316
Let's go.

37:02.350 --> 37:04.485
Check every trench.

37:11.426 --> 37:13.460
The only thing
going through your head is

37:13.495 --> 37:14.862
the next step
Th have to take.

37:23.371 --> 37:25.672
Move forward.
Find the enemy.

37:32.914 --> 37:34.314
But there was no enemy
to find.

37:34.349 --> 37:35.449
Clear.

37:35.483 --> 37:36.450
Clear.

37:37.519 --> 37:38.652
Go, go, go, go!

37:44.359 --> 37:46.360
Whatever it was
was actually, like,

37:46.394 --> 37:49.263
holding a gun next to my ear
and just opening fire.

37:51.332 --> 37:53.267
I'm gonna die

37:53.301 --> 37:55.736
on this God forsaken rock

37:55.770 --> 37:57.704
out in the middle
of Afghanistan.

38:07.777 --> 38:11.118
_

38:13.179 --> 38:15.514
All I remember
was hearing the noise.

38:17.217 --> 38:18.550
Ah!

38:21.254 --> 38:23.088
All of a sudden,
it was completely silent

38:23.122 --> 38:24.723
like there's nothing
even there,

38:24.757 --> 38:26.959
and I couldn't even explain
what was going on.

38:34.701 --> 38:36.802
What's going on?

38:36.836 --> 38:38.003
Everyone heard it.

38:38.037 --> 38:41.275
Everyone knew
it was a machine gun.

38:42.208 --> 38:44.776
At that point, we realized
there was no one there.

38:45.760 --> 38:48.380
We felt helpless.

38:48.414 --> 38:50.918
It's too much
for your mind to process.

38:52.552 --> 38:54.747
Lance Corporal Smith gets mad.

38:54.780 --> 38:56.153
He throws off his helmet.

38:57.190 --> 38:58.657
Friggin' O.P. Rock!

39:00.960 --> 39:02.928
We are all so ready

39:02.962 --> 39:05.364
to get off
that God forsaken piece of rock.

39:26.853 --> 39:29.688
Finally we heard
from the main base

39:29.722 --> 39:32.190
that we're no longer
gonna be there.

39:35.194 --> 39:37.062
It was amazing.

39:37.096 --> 39:39.431
We were packed up
and ready to go

39:39.465 --> 39:41.933
within five minutes
of getting the order.

39:44.070 --> 39:47.039
The moment we actually did
step foot off the rock,

39:47.073 --> 39:49.474
it was the greatest feeling
of all time.

39:49.509 --> 39:52.311
Like, I felt really happy
like it was like my birthday.

39:53.346 --> 39:54.913
Was Christmas to us,

39:54.947 --> 39:58.250
and we're finally
on our way out the door here.

39:58.284 --> 40:00.419
Someone else's problem now.

40:05.892 --> 40:08.093
So you chaps see any ghosts?

40:08.127 --> 40:10.429
Yeah, that place
is proper haunted.

40:11.731 --> 40:13.999
This one time, early on
when we first got here...

40:14.033 --> 40:16.501
Eventually, I found out
the true recent history

40:16.536 --> 40:18.970
behind O.P. Rock.

40:19.005 --> 40:21.073
Back when the Russians
first invaded,

40:21.107 --> 40:23.408
the Russians killed
all the Mujahideen up there,

40:23.443 --> 40:25.043
took it over for themselves.

40:26.079 --> 40:28.213
Later, the Taliban
rolled in force.

40:28.247 --> 40:29.818
In the middle of the night

40:29.852 --> 40:32.829
they snuck up
into the top of O.P. Rock,

40:32.863 --> 40:34.519
and stylistically beheaded

40:34.554 --> 40:38.056
all the Russian soldiers
up there.

40:38.091 --> 40:40.559
Finally when the marines
rolled through the area,

40:40.593 --> 40:44.696
they buried a number of Taliban
underground.

40:46.599 --> 40:48.698
It all started to make sense

40:49.869 --> 40:51.436
with the Russian stake,

40:51.471 --> 40:54.906
all the broken
and shattered bones,

40:54.941 --> 40:56.274
the voices we heard...

40:58.444 --> 41:00.014
And the images,

41:01.347 --> 41:02.547
the screams.

41:02.582 --> 41:04.416
Aah!

41:04.450 --> 41:07.419
This little piece of rock
was one giant tomb.

41:09.822 --> 41:12.457
As silly as it might sound,
you start to wonder,

41:12.492 --> 41:14.059
did we unleash something

41:14.093 --> 41:16.194
when we first started
digging up those bones?

41:16.229 --> 41:17.584
Hey, Lena.

41:17.774 --> 41:18.830
Make a wish.

41:18.865 --> 41:20.523
Some curse?

41:21.801 --> 41:25.370
I thought we were safe
from whatever was up there

41:25.405 --> 41:27.641
and we'd be able
to move on with our lives.

41:29.375 --> 41:32.411
We didn't realize
what was to come.

41:33.714 --> 41:38.915
_

41:40.086 --> 41:42.020
I just curled up in a ball
and just, like, cried,

41:42.054 --> 41:44.022
'cause he was
a good friend of mine.

41:44.056 --> 41:45.490
Really sad.

41:46.526 --> 41:48.026
It made no sense.

41:48.060 --> 41:49.494
You know,
you have a better chance

41:49.529 --> 41:51.963
of getting struck by lightning
than what happened with him.

41:52.817 --> 41:56.929
_

41:57.115 --> 41:59.037
We had been told going in
marines are gonna die,

41:59.071 --> 42:02.541
but we didn't expect
that many that fast.

42:02.575 --> 42:05.510
I mean, this is like... was some
Final Destination thing.

42:05.545 --> 42:07.179
What the hell's going on?

42:07.733 --> 42:11.758
_

42:11.792 --> 42:14.897
Yeah, you thought
you were done with O.P. Rock

42:14.959 --> 42:17.193
when you left,
but in some ways,

42:17.226 --> 42:18.800
it wasn't done with you.

42:19.031 --> 42:24.318
_

42:24.544 --> 42:26.253
You could tell it.
Man, we went on patrol...

42:26.286 --> 42:28.359
It just went bad.
He didn't make it.

42:28.393 --> 42:29.993
I mean, it's just...

42:32.016 --> 42:33.300
I mean, that... that...

42:34.335 --> 42:35.735
That brother, he just...

42:35.769 --> 42:37.340
There's no words
that can describe it.

42:37.423 --> 42:38.823
Really isn't.

42:41.617 --> 42:45.294
There is just
this really strange feeling.

42:45.855 --> 42:47.188
That was my family.

42:47.223 --> 42:49.791
And there are only
three of us left.

42:52.228 --> 42:54.095
I'm hoping
that the curse is over.

42:54.130 --> 42:55.763
I hope nothing happens to me,
I mean...

42:56.799 --> 42:58.099
Hopefully not.
