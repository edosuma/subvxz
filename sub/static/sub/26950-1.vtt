00:28.667 --> 00:30.584
(soft music,

00:28.667 --> 00:30.584
no audible sounds or dialogue)

02:04.083 --> 02:06.375
(soft music continues)

05:34.459 --> 05:36.000
- Look at your dead.

05:38.167 --> 05:39.250
Slaves.

05:42.417 --> 05:44.709
You are nothing more

05:42.417 --> 05:44.709
than slaves.

05:46.500 --> 05:50.918
Owned by a company that would

05:46.500 --> 05:50.918
turn boys into dead men

05:46.500 --> 05:50.918
in pursuit of profits.

05:51.834 --> 05:53.459
Slaves to a crown.

05:56.375 --> 05:58.250
A crown that spits on you,

05:58.626 --> 06:00.876
as you wallow

05:58.626 --> 06:00.876
in your own filth.

06:01.584 --> 06:03.459
They don't even see you

06:01.584 --> 06:03.459
as humans.

06:06.000 --> 06:10.083
A crown that forces you

06:06.000 --> 06:10.083
to cross unforgiving seas

06:06.000 --> 06:10.083
to fight free people.

06:13.667 --> 06:15.584
We are the Black Wolf Company.

06:16.542 --> 06:17.876
We are your outlaws.

06:19.375 --> 06:21.000
You call us

06:19.375 --> 06:21.000
the merciless savages,

06:21.042 --> 06:23.751
filthy half-breeds,

06:21.042 --> 06:23.751
natives of this land.

06:25.125 --> 06:27.375
We fight with the dregs,

06:25.125 --> 06:27.375
the despised!

06:28.167 --> 06:29.792
We are the killer of Redcoats.

06:31.459 --> 06:34.500
You think us devil to the Crown,

06:31.459 --> 06:34.500
and we are.

06:35.209 --> 06:36.792
We are because we are free.

06:43.500 --> 06:44.709
This.

06:45.709 --> 06:47.500
This is your worth.

06:48.209 --> 06:50.500
You are prostitutes for fur.

06:51.918 --> 06:55.000
This is our land,

06:51.918 --> 06:55.000
and you whores

06:51.918 --> 06:55.000
don't belong here.

06:55.042 --> 06:56.751
So leave, go home,

06:56.792 --> 06:59.125
and live a life

06:56.792 --> 06:59.125
decided by your masters.

06:59.667 --> 07:00.626
Or...

07:01.500 --> 07:02.667
or...

07:03.667 --> 07:06.709
...you turn coat

07:03.667 --> 07:06.709
and fight with us.

07:07.250 --> 07:10.334
Earn your way as free men

07:07.250 --> 07:10.334
with the Black Wolf Company.

07:10.667 --> 07:15.042
Lord Benton left Fort James

07:10.667 --> 07:15.042
by ship

07:10.667 --> 07:15.042
with the redheaded woman.

07:15.083 --> 07:16.459
Where did they go?

07:18.125 --> 07:19.584
- They were pressing north.

07:23.125 --> 07:27.209
They... pressed north

07:23.125 --> 07:27.209
to collect the rest

07:23.125 --> 07:27.209
of the provisions they need.

07:29.292 --> 07:31.292
- Did he bring the woman ashore?

07:32.751 --> 07:35.876
- No, just...

07:32.751 --> 07:35.876
just a few sailors.

07:36.792 --> 07:37.918
Sir.

07:41.292 --> 07:44.459
- Now, the only outpost I know

07:41.292 --> 07:44.459
further north is--

07:41.292 --> 07:44.459
- Moose Fort!

07:45.500 --> 07:49.375
You're having a laugh.

07:45.500 --> 07:49.375
That's a shithole.

07:45.500 --> 07:49.375
And it's cold as fuck.

07:49.417 --> 07:51.375
- Well...

07:51.417 --> 07:54.209
if you dogs want

07:51.417 --> 07:54.209
to have a hope of making a life

07:51.417 --> 07:54.209
for yourselves,

07:54.250 --> 07:56.876
you're going to abandon

07:54.250 --> 07:56.876
those coats and follow this man.

07:56.918 --> 07:59.834
He's gonna continue

07:56.918 --> 07:59.834
what I started

07:56.918 --> 07:59.834
with the Black Wolf Company.

08:01.834 --> 08:03.792
I need you to take control

08:01.834 --> 08:03.792
of Fort James.

08:06.751 --> 08:09.751
- How am I supposed to do that?

08:06.751 --> 08:09.751
Chesterfield's gonna be

08:06.751 --> 08:09.751
on the hunt for me.

08:10.709 --> 08:13.042
- Chesterfield won't be

08:10.709 --> 08:13.042
bothering anyone ever again.

08:14.000 --> 08:15.000
- Where is he?

08:18.292 --> 08:21.500
- Last time I saw him,

08:18.292 --> 08:21.500
he was standing too close

08:18.292 --> 08:21.500
to the edge of a cliff.

08:28.792 --> 08:30.459
Take Fort James.

08:31.459 --> 08:33.209
Avoid the bay.

08:31.459 --> 08:33.209
Head further west.

08:33.709 --> 08:36.083
But first you need

08:33.709 --> 08:36.083
to solve things with Sokanon.

08:37.542 --> 08:39.417
- She won't listen to me, Harp.

08:39.459 --> 08:42.083
I don't know if I can fix it.

08:39.459 --> 08:42.083
- You need to find a way,

08:39.459 --> 08:42.083
Michael.

08:48.792 --> 08:50.083
- And what about you?

08:51.459 --> 08:53.250
- Oh, we go north, to the ice.

08:53.292 --> 08:56.292
- No, I mean

08:53.292 --> 08:56.292
is this about Grace,

08:53.292 --> 08:56.292
or is this about Benton?

09:00.209 --> 09:01.876
- He will not take Grace

09:00.209 --> 09:01.876
from me.

09:04.167 --> 09:05.709
- And if it costs you your life?

09:08.500 --> 09:10.125
- I'm already dead.

09:12.709 --> 09:14.209
This is my resurrection.

09:18.459 --> 09:20.292
(theme music)

10:34.209 --> 10:37.834
- I'd eat if I was you,

10:34.209 --> 10:37.834
or Benton'll force it

10:34.209 --> 10:37.834
down your throat.

10:38.125 --> 10:42.167
- I suppose I'll need

10:38.125 --> 10:42.167
my strength if I'm to kill

10:38.125 --> 10:42.167
such a formidable man.

10:44.876 --> 10:45.918
I'm kidding.

10:46.542 --> 10:48.000
You don't need to fear me.

10:50.000 --> 10:51.709
I'm just a helpless woman.

10:51.751 --> 10:52.709
(scoffing)

10:54.459 --> 10:56.667
You know

10:54.459 --> 10:56.667
how helpless women are, right?

10:59.167 --> 11:00.584
'Course you do.

11:02.876 --> 11:05.459
Why else would you be compelled

11:02.876 --> 11:05.459
to dress as a man?

11:07.125 --> 11:08.792
Sorry. Is that a secret?

11:15.959 --> 11:16.959
- Sit.

11:27.626 --> 11:30.542
I am sure you all know

11:27.626 --> 11:30.542
why I have gathered you here.

11:33.125 --> 11:35.667
All of this land,

11:33.125 --> 11:35.667
from every waterway

11:35.709 --> 11:37.584
that contributes

11:35.709 --> 11:37.584
to Hudson's Bay,

11:37.626 --> 11:40.083
is the exclusive property

11:37.626 --> 11:40.083
of the HBC.

11:40.667 --> 11:43.042
Those who carry on

11:40.667 --> 11:43.042
their business on this land

11:43.083 --> 11:47.500
in defiance

11:43.083 --> 11:47.500
of the Hudson's Bay Company

11:43.083 --> 11:47.500
are not our competition.

11:48.334 --> 11:50.292
They are our sworn enemies.

11:52.000 --> 11:55.751
Since the abrupt

11:52.000 --> 11:55.751
and unauthorized departure

11:52.000 --> 11:55.751
of Lord Benton,

11:55.792 --> 11:59.459
it appears Fort James

11:55.792 --> 11:59.459
has been wrapped

11:55.792 --> 11:59.459
in a personal rivalry

11:59.500 --> 12:03.876
with a former company employee

11:59.500 --> 12:03.876
named Declan Harp.

12:04.542 --> 12:08.334
In recent seasons,

12:04.542 --> 12:08.334
the leadership of our men

12:04.542 --> 12:08.334
at Fort James

12:08.375 --> 12:10.250
has deteriorated

12:08.375 --> 12:10.250
to such an extent

12:10.292 --> 12:13.125
that we appear

12:10.292 --> 12:13.125
to have all but lost control.

12:13.667 --> 12:18.334
The most recent report

12:13.667 --> 12:18.334
speaks of a successful raid

12:13.667 --> 12:18.334
on the fort itself,

12:18.375 --> 12:22.375
which has deprived our company

12:18.375 --> 12:22.375
of an entire season's stock

12:18.375 --> 12:22.375
of furs.

12:22.417 --> 12:23.667
Gentlemen...

12:24.542 --> 12:26.292
...it is not the French

12:24.542 --> 12:26.292
who will bring about

12:26.334 --> 12:28.667
the downfall

12:26.334 --> 12:28.667
of this great company.

12:29.417 --> 12:31.000
It is our own indiscipline.

12:31.959 --> 12:36.417
Our men sit in their cozy forts,

12:31.959 --> 12:36.417
getting fat and drunk,

12:36.459 --> 12:39.334
waiting for the Natives

12:36.459 --> 12:39.334
to come to them in the bay,

12:40.000 --> 12:43.167
while the French and Scots

12:40.000 --> 12:43.167
are free to roam the interior,

12:43.209 --> 12:45.209
cutting us off at will.

12:45.709 --> 12:47.792
We must move inland.

12:48.709 --> 12:53.209
We must persuade

12:48.709 --> 12:53.209
their trading partners

12:48.709 --> 12:53.209
to do business with us.

12:54.042 --> 12:57.334
I have sent a man to instill

12:54.042 --> 12:57.334
this much-needed discipline.

12:58.375 --> 13:00.042
His name is Major Vinnicombe.

13:00.918 --> 13:03.709
A name the heathens

13:00.918 --> 13:03.709
will soon learn to dread.

13:04.667 --> 13:06.417
It is our duty to ensure

13:06.459 --> 13:10.125
that our complete dominance

13:06.459 --> 13:10.125
of the dominion lasts forever.

13:12.417 --> 13:17.250
(speaking Cree)

13:21.292 --> 13:22.500
(soft exclamation)

13:24.292 --> 13:25.709
(cracking branch)

13:25.751 --> 13:28.292
(exclaiming)

13:25.751 --> 13:28.292
- Hey, easy.

13:29.334 --> 13:30.584
It's only me.

13:32.334 --> 13:34.292
- Why have you come here,

13:32.334 --> 13:34.292
Michael?

13:34.709 --> 13:36.334
- I'm here to make amends.

13:37.500 --> 13:38.959
- It's too late for that.

13:40.083 --> 13:42.667
- Wahush's death

13:40.083 --> 13:42.667
was an accident, Sokanon.

13:45.500 --> 13:48.375
- Wahush died

13:45.500 --> 13:48.375
so you could make money.

13:49.584 --> 13:51.042
I want you to leave.

13:52.792 --> 13:54.542
- Sokanon, I came here

13:52.792 --> 13:54.542
because I'm worried

13:52.792 --> 13:54.542
it's becoming unsafe.

13:54.584 --> 13:57.500
We need to stick together!

13:54.584 --> 13:57.500
You'd understand

13:54.584 --> 13:57.500
if you saw what I saw.

13:58.125 --> 13:59.709
- What did you see?

14:01.709 --> 14:04.792
- I was fighting alongside Harp

14:01.709 --> 14:04.792
and I saw Redcoats attack

14:01.709 --> 14:04.792
a MÃ©tis settlement.

14:05.584 --> 14:07.542
They were killing everyone,

14:05.584 --> 14:07.542
men and women.

14:09.542 --> 14:12.959
- Do you think

14:09.542 --> 14:12.959
I do not understand

14:09.542 --> 14:12.959
what that looks like, Michael?

14:15.751 --> 14:17.500
- We arrived too late

14:15.751 --> 14:17.500
to stop the Redcoats

14:17.542 --> 14:19.709
from burning the settlement

14:17.542 --> 14:19.709
to the ground, but...

14:19.751 --> 14:23.167
That's why I want you

14:19.751 --> 14:23.167
to come with us.

14:19.751 --> 14:23.167
We're safe together.

14:24.375 --> 14:27.000
- There are young girls

14:24.375 --> 14:27.000
being held against their will

14:24.375 --> 14:27.000
at Moose Fort.

14:27.042 --> 14:28.876
- Sokanon,

14:27.042 --> 14:28.876
you can't go to Moose Fort.

14:29.459 --> 14:31.626
Harp is on his way there

14:29.459 --> 14:31.626
and he's looking for a fight.

14:31.667 --> 14:34.250
If there are any women there,

14:31.667 --> 14:34.250
they'll be gone

14:31.667 --> 14:34.250
by the time you arrive.

14:35.709 --> 14:38.292
Harp wants to secure a deal

14:35.709 --> 14:38.292
with the Lake Walkers here.

14:39.209 --> 14:41.792
- Of course.

14:39.209 --> 14:41.792
This is about business.

14:43.083 --> 14:45.626
- I want the Black Wolf Company

14:43.083 --> 14:45.626
to...

14:43.083 --> 14:45.626
(rustling)

14:54.334 --> 14:56.626
(background chatter)

15:00.918 --> 15:03.834
- We're searching for a fugitive

15:00.918 --> 15:03.834
named Michael Smyth.

15:03.876 --> 15:06.584
Has he been here?

15:03.876 --> 15:06.584
- No. I have not seen him.

15:07.125 --> 15:08.542
- Trading with the French,

15:07.125 --> 15:08.542
are ya?

15:09.250 --> 15:11.000
- Mr. Rivard is my guest.

15:11.042 --> 15:13.167
There's no crime

15:11.042 --> 15:13.167
in welcoming a traveller.

15:13.709 --> 15:16.000
- My men and I are free men

15:13.709 --> 15:16.000
of Quebec.

15:16.042 --> 15:19.375
- Well, you're not in Quebec,

15:16.042 --> 15:19.375
are ya? You're on HBC land.

15:19.417 --> 15:22.959
<i>(in French): This is nonsense.</i>

15:19.417 --> 15:22.959
<i>You brutish asshole!</i>

15:24.292 --> 15:26.375
- Take the trade goods and furs.

15:27.209 --> 15:31.792
Consider this a warning

15:27.209 --> 15:31.792
of what's to come if I find out

15:27.209 --> 15:31.792
you've seen Michael Smyth here.

15:31.834 --> 15:35.375
And if I see you

15:31.834 --> 15:35.375
with this French scum again,

15:31.834 --> 15:35.375
then you will suffer.

15:35.792 --> 15:37.626
(exclamations)

15:37.667 --> 15:39.375
<i>(in French):</i>

15:37.667 --> 15:39.375
<i>There will be no violence.</i>

15:41.375 --> 15:43.250
- Just give me an excuse,

15:43.292 --> 15:45.542
and I'll set

15:43.292 --> 15:45.542
this whole camp ablaze.

16:01.834 --> 16:03.584
- This is what you bring.

16:12.250 --> 16:13.375
- Good afternoon.

16:17.584 --> 16:19.417
- You obviously don't know

16:17.584 --> 16:19.417
who I am.

16:19.459 --> 16:21.542
- Oh, I know who you think

16:19.459 --> 16:21.542
you are, Mr. Grant.

16:21.584 --> 16:23.250
The question is,

16:21.584 --> 16:23.250
do you know who I am?

16:23.292 --> 16:26.292
- A cocker spaniel?

16:23.292 --> 16:26.292
- Hmm. Hmm.

16:26.334 --> 16:28.125
Cobbs Pond, I presume?

16:28.167 --> 16:29.751
Are you still wanted

16:28.167 --> 16:29.751
in your home country

16:29.792 --> 16:32.751
for burning down churches

16:29.792 --> 16:32.751
in New England, priests and all?

16:33.542 --> 16:35.125
- Well, we were all young once.

16:36.667 --> 16:37.876
- Indeed.

16:38.542 --> 16:41.083
Most people cower

16:38.542 --> 16:41.083
when they see me arrive.

16:41.125 --> 16:44.918
- Hmm... Shiver me timbers.

16:41.125 --> 16:44.918
- Yes.

16:44.959 --> 16:46.959
- I don't give a goddamn

16:44.959 --> 16:46.959
who you are.

16:47.375 --> 16:48.584
What do you want?

16:54.125 --> 16:56.125
- There are rumours about you,

16:54.125 --> 16:56.125
Mr. Grant.

16:59.167 --> 17:02.584
- His Highness, the King,

16:59.167 --> 17:02.584
wouldn't send a major

16:59.167 --> 17:02.584
to peddle in rumours.

17:03.459 --> 17:04.959
Why are you really here?

17:06.375 --> 17:07.626
- Brandy.

17:09.167 --> 17:11.542
- Cobbs, would you kindly

17:09.167 --> 17:11.542
get the major a brandy?

17:15.667 --> 17:18.000
- Business has been good,

17:15.667 --> 17:18.000
it seems.

17:18.042 --> 17:20.250
There is great interest

17:18.042 --> 17:20.250
in London

17:20.292 --> 17:22.709
in the nature of your dealings

17:20.292 --> 17:22.709
as of late.

17:23.584 --> 17:26.667
Specifically, with whom

17:23.584 --> 17:26.667
you have been dealing.

17:29.959 --> 17:31.375
- LeBlanc, leave us.

17:38.500 --> 17:39.667
- And him?

17:41.542 --> 17:43.125
(door closing)

17:44.918 --> 17:46.292
Thank you so much.

17:49.000 --> 17:51.000
Mm. Lovely

17:54.334 --> 17:58.626
- I shot a mountain lion

17:54.334 --> 17:58.626
near the Cumberland Gap

17:54.334 --> 17:58.626
when I was a child.

17:58.667 --> 18:02.751
I skinned it and sold its hide

17:58.667 --> 18:02.751
for two dollars,

18:02.792 --> 18:04.167
and since that day,

18:04.209 --> 18:07.334
I have traded more hides

18:04.209 --> 18:07.334
than any man alive,

18:07.375 --> 18:10.209
and I've done business

18:07.375 --> 18:10.209
with hundreds, maybe thousands.

18:10.250 --> 18:12.709
So you might need

18:10.250 --> 18:12.709
to be a little more specific.

18:12.751 --> 18:16.500
- The law is very clear

18:12.751 --> 18:16.500
that the land that encompasses

18:12.751 --> 18:16.500
all the tributary rivers

18:16.542 --> 18:20.042
flowing into the Hudson Bay

18:16.542 --> 18:20.042
is the dominion of the HBC.

18:20.083 --> 18:22.125
And a man like yourself,

18:20.083 --> 18:22.125
Mr. Grant,

18:22.167 --> 18:26.042
who buys furs from voyageurs,

18:22.167 --> 18:26.042
is in direct violation

18:22.167 --> 18:26.042
of that law.

18:26.083 --> 18:28.083
- Yes, well, we are in Montreal;

18:28.125 --> 18:31.667
not in his Highness's

18:28.125 --> 18:31.667
jurisdiction,

18:28.125 --> 18:31.667
but under French law.

18:31.709 --> 18:34.000
-<i> L'acte de Quebec</i>

18:31.709 --> 18:34.000
does not supersede the grant

18:34.042 --> 18:37.000
of Rupert's Land in 1670

18:34.042 --> 18:37.000
to the Hudson Bay Company.

18:37.042 --> 18:39.042
At this very moment,

18:37.042 --> 18:39.042
my men have descended

18:39.083 --> 18:42.500
upon your dock-front warehouse

18:39.083 --> 18:42.500
to seize its contents.

18:42.542 --> 18:45.000
You obtained those furs

18:42.542 --> 18:45.000
illegally, Mr. Grant.

18:45.042 --> 18:47.792
It is my duty

18:45.042 --> 18:47.792
to enforce the king's law.

18:53.500 --> 18:55.167
- What is your price, Major?

18:56.250 --> 18:59.375
- I'm aware that Mr. Pond

18:56.250 --> 18:59.375
accompanied a group

18:56.250 --> 18:59.375
of voyageurs

18:59.417 --> 19:01.751
to a location

18:59.417 --> 19:01.751
known as Petrie's Rock

19:01.792 --> 19:05.751
to purchase stolen HBC furs

19:01.792 --> 19:05.751
from a man

19:01.792 --> 19:05.751
known as Michael Smyth.

19:07.709 --> 19:11.834
See, it seems you paid

19:07.709 --> 19:11.834
your voyageurs well enough

19:07.709 --> 19:11.834
for their labour,

19:12.334 --> 19:14.083
but not for their silence.

19:16.584 --> 19:20.542
- Even if that were true...

19:16.584 --> 19:20.542
those furs are long gone.

19:21.292 --> 19:23.083
- Oh, I don't want the furs.

19:23.626 --> 19:25.584
I want Michael Smyth.

19:29.292 --> 19:31.792
(Michael): I'm saying

19:29.292 --> 19:31.792
that we can cut

19:29.292 --> 19:31.792
the HBC out entirely.

19:31.834 --> 19:33.292
- Those are dangerous words.

19:33.334 --> 19:35.042
- You can trade

19:33.334 --> 19:35.042
with the buyers in Montreal

19:35.083 --> 19:36.584
through Rivard

19:35.083 --> 19:36.584
and others like him.

19:36.626 --> 19:38.500
- You don't represent

19:36.626 --> 19:38.500
the buyers in Montreal.

19:38.542 --> 19:40.542
- But the Montrealers,

19:38.542 --> 19:40.542
they know a good deal

19:38.542 --> 19:40.542
when they see one.

19:40.584 --> 19:44.709
- The Montreal companies

19:40.584 --> 19:44.709
will climb over their dead

19:40.584 --> 19:44.709
for a beaver token.

19:49.209 --> 19:51.000
- When the Black Wolf Company

19:49.209 --> 19:51.000
robbed Fort James,

19:51.042 --> 19:53.334
we proved that

19:51.042 --> 19:53.334
the HBC could be beaten.

19:53.375 --> 19:56.083
We can get enough fur to start

19:53.375 --> 19:56.083
our own independent fort,

19:56.125 --> 19:58.209
to trade fairly with you

19:56.125 --> 19:58.209
and your people.

19:58.792 --> 20:00.792
(Rivard):

19:58.792 --> 20:00.792
What he's saying is true.

20:00.834 --> 20:03.083
- If I could go to Montreal

20:00.834 --> 20:03.083
with a guarantee

20:00.834 --> 20:03.083
of Lake Walker pelts--

20:03.125 --> 20:06.584
- No, the HBC will stamp us out

20:03.125 --> 20:06.584
before they let us

20:03.125 --> 20:06.584
band together.

20:06.626 --> 20:09.292
- The power of the HBC

20:06.626 --> 20:09.292
is the very issue.

20:09.334 --> 20:11.417
- That's why

20:09.334 --> 20:11.417
we have to band together.

20:11.459 --> 20:15.417
- If you can bring a supply

20:11.459 --> 20:15.417
of trustworthy buyers

20:11.459 --> 20:15.417
from Montreal,

20:15.876 --> 20:18.459
and a predictable supply

20:15.876 --> 20:18.459
of trade goods,

20:19.000 --> 20:21.000
then I'll consider

20:19.000 --> 20:21.000
your arrangement.

20:21.542 --> 20:22.876
But only then.

20:24.918 --> 20:25.792
- Thank you.

20:29.042 --> 20:30.417
(Grant):

20:29.042 --> 20:30.417
No, the simplest solution

20:30.459 --> 20:32.167
is to find Michael Smyth

20:30.459 --> 20:32.167
and turn him in.

20:32.209 --> 20:35.584
- Might prove to be challenging.

20:32.209 --> 20:35.584
- Not with Clenna's help.

20:36.876 --> 20:39.209
- She's gonna need

20:36.876 --> 20:39.209
to be steered into that.

20:39.250 --> 20:42.167
Clenna's not gonna

20:39.250 --> 20:42.167
betray Michael on purpose.

20:42.209 --> 20:43.834
- What makes you so sure?

20:45.250 --> 20:48.459
- He stepped in and saved her

20:45.250 --> 20:48.459
so gallantly at Petrie Rock.

20:49.125 --> 20:52.459
- Is she more loyal to him

20:49.125 --> 20:52.459
than us?

20:49.125 --> 20:52.459
(Pond sighing)

20:54.125 --> 20:56.375
- Let's not test that

20:54.125 --> 20:56.375
if we don't have to.

20:56.417 --> 20:58.959
- If she's not loyal to us,

20:56.417 --> 20:58.959
what the hell is she doing here?

20:59.000 --> 21:02.125
- All I'm saying...

20:59.000 --> 21:02.125
is that there are other people

21:02.167 --> 21:04.584
we can make alliances with

21:02.167 --> 21:04.584
beside the HBC.

21:07.459 --> 21:10.250
Samuel, are you alright?

21:07.459 --> 21:10.250
You don't seem yourself.

21:10.751 --> 21:12.000
Hmm?

21:13.334 --> 21:14.918
- I feel like I'm going mad.

21:16.250 --> 21:19.167
I wouldn't consider myself

21:16.250 --> 21:19.167
a religious person, but...

21:19.751 --> 21:24.000
...I feel like someone's puppet.

21:19.751 --> 21:24.000
Who's pulling my strings, Pond?

21:24.042 --> 21:26.125
- No one is pulling

21:24.042 --> 21:26.125
your strings.

21:27.334 --> 21:29.167
You just feel

21:27.334 --> 21:29.167
a little bit guilty.

21:29.918 --> 21:32.334
You have to forgive yourself

21:29.918 --> 21:32.334
for Elizabeth.

21:32.375 --> 21:36.709
- I don't... feel guilty

21:32.375 --> 21:36.709
for what happened to Elizabeth.

21:37.918 --> 21:39.626
She brought that trouble

21:37.918 --> 21:39.626
on herself.

21:39.667 --> 21:40.959
- Of course she did.

21:43.209 --> 21:45.167
Dance with me. Please, come.

21:45.209 --> 21:47.209
Let's just forget all of this.

21:51.792 --> 21:54.959
One, two, three.

21:55.000 --> 21:56.334
Two, two, three.

21:56.709 --> 22:00.292
Perhaps you and Clenna

21:56.709 --> 22:00.292
can go visit Mr. Brown,

22:00.334 --> 22:02.209
see if he's ready

22:00.334 --> 22:02.209
to discuss business.

22:04.626 --> 22:06.959
- I do not need you

22:04.626 --> 22:06.959
to manage me!!

22:23.250 --> 22:25.626
- Look lively, Chaulk.

22:23.250 --> 22:25.626
- Yes, sir.

22:32.167 --> 22:33.792
Right,

22:32.167 --> 22:33.792
we'll be going to shore now.

22:34.459 --> 22:36.042
- Where's he taking me?

22:36.751 --> 22:38.876
- I dunno.

22:36.751 --> 22:38.876
Get supplies, I expect.

22:39.334 --> 22:40.542
- When will we leave?

22:40.959 --> 22:42.459
- I don't know, do I?

22:44.125 --> 22:47.209
- You've taken on many traits

22:44.125 --> 22:47.209
of a man in order to survive.

22:49.918 --> 22:51.667
- How did you know?

22:51.709 --> 22:53.292
- Let me ask you something.

22:54.209 --> 22:56.292
What are his Lordship's plans

22:54.209 --> 22:56.292
with me?

22:57.751 --> 22:59.459
- I dunno.

22:59.500 --> 23:02.959
I think it's got something to do

22:59.500 --> 23:02.959
with that, uh, Declan Harp?

23:03.459 --> 23:05.250
- What do you know about Harp?

23:06.250 --> 23:07.918
- All I know is,

23:06.250 --> 23:07.918
he's an animal.

23:09.292 --> 23:12.250
- First time I met him,

23:09.292 --> 23:12.250
he had just delivered ten boats

23:12.292 --> 23:14.751
of trade goods

23:12.292 --> 23:14.751
in exchange for furs.

23:14.792 --> 23:16.709
I had a bit of fire

23:14.792 --> 23:16.709
at the livery the night before,

23:16.751 --> 23:18.626
and the food stores

23:16.751 --> 23:18.626
had been destroyed.

23:19.250 --> 23:21.918
So Harp and his men

23:19.250 --> 23:21.918
go out on a hunt.

23:22.876 --> 23:26.375
And they came back

23:22.876 --> 23:26.375
with eight quarters of moose.

23:27.209 --> 23:31.334
They ate and drank all night

23:27.209 --> 23:31.334
at the alehouse,

23:27.209 --> 23:31.334
but when they were done,

23:31.375 --> 23:33.417
they left enough meat

23:31.375 --> 23:33.417
so the people of Fort James

23:33.459 --> 23:35.584
had food

23:33.459 --> 23:35.584
until the next supply boat came.

23:36.250 --> 23:38.918
When I asked him

23:36.250 --> 23:38.918
why he did that, he said,

23:39.500 --> 23:41.792
"Because everyone gets hungry."

23:41.834 --> 23:44.167
- Is that how you two

23:41.834 --> 23:44.167
came to be together, then?

23:45.959 --> 23:49.250
- He had a wife back then.

23:45.959 --> 23:49.250
- What? What, you...

23:49.292 --> 23:52.959
you fell for a married man?

23:49.292 --> 23:52.959
Well, how'd you get rid of her?

23:54.667 --> 23:56.459
- That was Benton.

23:58.125 --> 23:59.375
He killed her.

24:00.792 --> 24:02.417
Killed his son, too.

24:04.751 --> 24:06.292
That changed Declan.

24:07.209 --> 24:10.000
Declan was once loyal

24:07.209 --> 24:10.000
to Benton, like you are.

24:11.292 --> 24:13.292
But you can never be loyal

24:11.292 --> 24:13.292
enough.

24:14.375 --> 24:16.751
You will always be in danger

24:14.375 --> 24:16.751
of betraying him.

24:16.792 --> 24:20.167
And when you do...

24:16.792 --> 24:20.167
he will go where it hurts

24:16.792 --> 24:20.167
the most.

24:22.375 --> 24:24.626
Why do you think

24:22.375 --> 24:24.626
he's helping you?

24:26.500 --> 24:28.584
Don't you think

24:26.500 --> 24:28.584
it'll have a cost?

24:28.626 --> 24:31.250
(bell clanging)

24:28.626 --> 24:31.250
- Chaulk!

24:32.417 --> 24:33.959
Get to your station!

25:15.292 --> 25:18.626
- Remind me, Charlie.

25:15.292 --> 25:18.626
Why are we doing this exactly?

25:18.667 --> 25:21.250
Chasing this bastard Benton.

25:18.667 --> 25:21.250
It's a waste of time.

25:21.292 --> 25:22.876
He'll be long gone.

25:22.918 --> 25:25.167
- Well, Harp's not gonna

25:22.918 --> 25:25.167
let Benton harm Miss Emberly.

25:25.209 --> 25:27.459
- Yeah, but we're all going

25:25.209 --> 25:27.459
to perish, Charlie.

25:27.959 --> 25:32.083
Oh. Could freeze the bones

25:27.959 --> 25:32.083
off a brass monkey

25:27.959 --> 25:32.083
where we're going.

25:34.000 --> 25:36.417
- Did you ever search

25:34.000 --> 25:36.417
for something that...

25:36.459 --> 25:38.459
you're afraid you might find?

25:39.918 --> 25:42.542
A man's hopes

25:39.918 --> 25:42.542
are a dangerous thing,

25:39.918 --> 25:42.542
McTaggart.

25:43.709 --> 25:45.709
- Really?

25:45.751 --> 25:48.751
But Benton's probably

25:45.751 --> 25:48.751
chopped her up into wee bits

25:45.751 --> 25:48.751
a long time ago.

25:48.792 --> 25:50.792
She'll be the meat ingredient

25:48.792 --> 25:50.792
in a good soup-

25:50.834 --> 25:52.626
(grunting)

25:50.834 --> 25:52.626
- Harp, he didn't mean it!

25:52.667 --> 25:54.459
(McTaggart screaming)

25:52.667 --> 25:54.459
He didn't mean it, Harp!

25:54.500 --> 25:57.667
The man's just at the end

25:54.500 --> 25:57.667
of his rope, is all!

25:54.500 --> 25:57.667
(grunting)

25:57.709 --> 26:00.959
- You bite your tongue

25:57.709 --> 26:00.959
or I'll bite it off.

25:57.709 --> 26:00.959
(McTaggart choking)

26:01.375 --> 26:03.167
(exclaiming)

26:03.209 --> 26:05.125
(coughing)

26:06.125 --> 26:07.709
You turn back.

26:06.125 --> 26:07.709
(panting)

26:08.959 --> 26:10.500
This is my fight, not yours.

26:21.459 --> 26:23.042
- Have a word with yourself,

26:21.459 --> 26:23.042
Harp.

26:23.083 --> 26:25.042
Of course I'm coming with ya.

26:25.083 --> 26:26.751
What else am I gonna do?

26:28.250 --> 26:30.292
Options are a bit limited now.

26:35.626 --> 26:38.042
- Wadlow?!

26:35.626 --> 26:38.042
- Benton.

26:38.626 --> 26:40.125
Is that you?

26:40.167 --> 26:42.334
(boisterous laughter)

26:40.167 --> 26:42.334
- How are you, my boy?!

26:42.375 --> 26:43.584
(laughing)

26:43.626 --> 26:46.083
- To what do I owe this...

26:43.626 --> 26:46.083
pleasure?

26:46.125 --> 26:49.375
- I presume you've heard

26:46.125 --> 26:49.375
that Declan Harp and myself

26:49.417 --> 26:52.709
have had some...

26:49.417 --> 26:52.709
disagreements of late.

26:52.751 --> 26:57.042
- I heard you couldn't break

26:52.751 --> 26:57.042
that thick neck of his.

26:52.751 --> 26:57.042
- In time.

26:57.792 --> 26:59.250
But in the meantime,

26:59.292 --> 27:03.042
I need a secure area

26:59.292 --> 27:03.042
to hide my prisoner.

27:05.334 --> 27:06.542
- Be my guest.

27:11.500 --> 27:15.042
- You see, Chaulk...

27:11.500 --> 27:15.042
loyalty is power.

27:22.375 --> 27:23.709
- Mr. Brown.

27:28.959 --> 27:32.000
Every day on your knees,

27:28.959 --> 27:32.000
mourning your wife.

27:32.042 --> 27:33.876
You're an excellent widower,

27:32.042 --> 27:33.876
Douglas.

27:36.000 --> 27:37.167
I mean that sincerely.

27:37.209 --> 27:39.042
- How dare you come here?

27:40.417 --> 27:43.250
I know what you did

27:40.417 --> 27:43.250
to Elizabeth.

27:43.918 --> 27:47.500
I may not be able to prove it.

27:43.918 --> 27:47.500
That doesn't change the truth.

27:47.542 --> 27:50.751
- I'm not here to lament

27:47.542 --> 27:50.751
water under the bridge.

27:50.792 --> 27:54.083
I'm here to offer you

27:50.792 --> 27:54.083
a business proposition.

27:57.209 --> 27:58.709
- You killed my wife.

27:59.334 --> 28:02.584
And usurped our business deal

27:59.334 --> 28:02.584
with the Black Wolf Company.

28:02.626 --> 28:07.375
And you now have the delusion,

28:02.626 --> 28:07.375
somehow,

28:02.626 --> 28:07.375
that I'd do business with you?

28:07.417 --> 28:10.667
- Yes, well, the tides

28:07.417 --> 28:10.667
are changing in Montreal.

28:11.209 --> 28:13.792
I was visited by a man named

28:11.209 --> 28:13.792
Major Vinnicombe,

28:13.834 --> 28:16.375
who casts the long shadow

28:13.834 --> 28:16.375
of the Crown. And if--

28:16.417 --> 28:20.500
- I'd sooner drink my own piss

28:16.417 --> 28:20.500
than partner with scum like you!

28:20.542 --> 28:22.042
- Shh!

28:22.500 --> 28:24.250
- Sorry.

28:22.500 --> 28:24.250
(Douglas panting)

28:25.876 --> 28:27.250
Hear me out, please.

28:29.417 --> 28:33.209
I know that Carruthers & Company

28:29.417 --> 28:33.209
suffered the same setbacks

28:29.417 --> 28:33.209
we did from this crackdown.

28:33.250 --> 28:34.667
Probably worse.

28:35.292 --> 28:38.417
The only way we move forward

28:35.292 --> 28:38.417
in this business

28:38.459 --> 28:41.459
is if we pool our resources.

28:38.459 --> 28:41.459
Us against them.

28:41.500 --> 28:43.751
You understand that.

28:41.500 --> 28:43.751
- I still see her,

28:43.792 --> 28:45.751
lying there in the dirt...

28:47.292 --> 28:48.876
...whenever I close my eyes.

28:49.876 --> 28:51.667
Her skull's caved in,

28:52.334 --> 28:53.876
flies buzzing about.

29:03.667 --> 29:06.292
- I respect the fact

29:03.667 --> 29:06.292
that you need to mourn.

29:08.000 --> 29:09.709
But don't underestimate me.

29:10.459 --> 29:14.000
This is our opportunity

29:10.459 --> 29:14.000
for a fresh start, Douglas.

29:15.709 --> 29:18.125
- Do not underestimate<i> me,</i>

29:15.709 --> 29:18.125
Samuel Grant.

29:18.876 --> 29:22.375
It'd do you well to remember

29:18.876 --> 29:22.375
there's nothing more dangerous

29:23.083 --> 29:25.334
than a man who's had everything

29:23.083 --> 29:25.334
taken from him.

29:33.209 --> 29:34.334
- Ahem.

29:36.792 --> 29:40.834
(Grant): Brown is a damned fool

29:36.792 --> 29:40.834
whose feeble morality

29:36.792 --> 29:40.834
will be his demise!

29:40.876 --> 29:44.459
- He's still grieving.

29:40.876 --> 29:44.459
He just needs some time.

29:40.876 --> 29:44.459
- There is no time, Cobbs!

29:45.584 --> 29:49.209
I'm going to lose

29:45.584 --> 29:49.209
everything I've built,

29:45.584 --> 29:49.209
and it's thanks to you.

29:49.250 --> 29:50.959
- Me?

29:49.250 --> 29:50.959
- Yes.

29:51.000 --> 29:52.959
- What did I do?

29:51.000 --> 29:52.959
- Because of you,

29:53.000 --> 29:56.542
Major Vinnicombe has linked

29:53.000 --> 29:56.542
Michael Smyth to me.

29:56.584 --> 29:59.542
- Samuel,

29:56.584 --> 29:59.542
that's not entirely true.

29:56.584 --> 29:59.542
- Watch yourself, Cobbs!

29:59.584 --> 30:01.500
- I'm sorry.

29:59.584 --> 30:01.500
I was trying to help.

30:01.542 --> 30:03.167
- I'm beginning to wonder

30:01.542 --> 30:03.167
where your loyalties lie.

30:03.209 --> 30:05.375
- I'm not the one

30:03.209 --> 30:05.375
who snatched that deal

30:05.417 --> 30:07.792
from Elizabeth Carruthers's

30:05.417 --> 30:07.792
dead hands.

30:05.417 --> 30:07.792
- Clenna, that's not helping.

30:08.959 --> 30:10.959
I think

30:08.959 --> 30:10.959
I may have misheard you.

30:12.083 --> 30:17.542
- I believe I have demonstrated

30:12.083 --> 30:17.542
how loyal I am

30:12.083 --> 30:17.542
to you and Mr. Pond.

30:17.584 --> 30:20.167
Have you forgotten who

30:17.584 --> 30:20.167
cleaned up Elizabeth's brains?

30:22.083 --> 30:25.834
Still, you men never ask

30:22.083 --> 30:25.834
my opinion

30:22.083 --> 30:25.834
about your business dealings,

30:25.876 --> 30:27.959
so I'm not going

30:25.876 --> 30:27.959
to take your blame.

30:28.000 --> 30:30.209
- Oh, you have an opinion,

30:28.000 --> 30:30.209
now do you?!

30:30.250 --> 30:33.292
- It was the voyageurs

30:30.250 --> 30:33.292
that betrayed us to the major,

30:30.250 --> 30:33.292
not Clenna.

30:33.876 --> 30:35.375
- Douglas Brown...

30:35.417 --> 30:37.292
is not a businessman.

30:37.959 --> 30:41.042
He... he wants to be,

30:37.959 --> 30:41.042
he tries to be,

30:37.959 --> 30:41.042
but he is a failure.

30:41.083 --> 30:42.876
- And when did you discover

30:41.083 --> 30:42.876
this amazing secret?

30:42.918 --> 30:46.250
- He is vulnerable.

30:42.918 --> 30:46.250
He fell for a ruthless woman,

30:46.292 --> 30:48.000
and more importantly,

30:46.292 --> 30:48.000
she fell for him.

30:48.042 --> 30:50.667
- Cobbs, do you understand

30:48.042 --> 30:50.667
any of this woman-speak?

30:50.709 --> 30:53.417
- The only way

30:50.709 --> 30:53.417
to get to him is his heart.

30:54.083 --> 30:58.417
Stop trying to break Mr. Brown

30:54.083 --> 30:58.417
and... and let me handle it.

31:10.209 --> 31:12.209
- It is impossible

31:10.209 --> 31:12.209
to impress me.

31:13.125 --> 31:14.584
But you almost did.

31:18.250 --> 31:20.584
- Let me demonstrate my loyalty.

31:21.584 --> 31:24.667
I will appeal

31:21.584 --> 31:24.667
to Mr. Brown's softer side.

31:25.167 --> 31:26.876
And he will join you.

31:26.918 --> 31:30.292
- Oh, I'm sure you'll have him

31:26.918 --> 31:30.292
eating out of your palm.

31:34.959 --> 31:36.209
- Very well.

31:44.959 --> 31:46.918
(wind raging)

32:00.083 --> 32:01.709
- Harp!!!

32:02.417 --> 32:04.250
Harp!!!

32:05.375 --> 32:06.876
Harp!!!

32:09.918 --> 32:11.292
Harp!!!

32:19.500 --> 32:21.083
Harp!!!

32:34.542 --> 32:36.125
I got ya.

32:36.167 --> 32:37.876
I got ya. Hold on now.

32:49.918 --> 32:51.334
- Stand him up.

32:49.918 --> 32:51.334
(grunting)

32:55.667 --> 32:57.375
- Wrap this around him.

32:57.417 --> 32:59.292
Get some heat to his bones.

32:59.334 --> 33:01.959
- I can't feel my hands!

32:59.334 --> 33:01.959
- Let me see.

33:02.042 --> 33:03.834
Let me see your hands!

33:02.042 --> 33:03.834
- Ah!!

33:03.876 --> 33:06.250
- Sorry.

33:03.876 --> 33:06.250
- Fuck!

33:06.876 --> 33:09.125
- Ah, damn it, no.

33:06.876 --> 33:09.125
(groaning)

33:10.083 --> 33:12.292
(breathing heavily)

33:13.334 --> 33:15.834
(muttering indistinctly)

33:17.250 --> 33:19.667
Sonofa...

33:17.250 --> 33:19.667
(McTaggart moaning)

33:24.876 --> 33:26.167
Ah...

33:26.959 --> 33:29.167
Charlie, we gotta keep going.

33:30.417 --> 33:31.918
- Push on.

33:30.417 --> 33:31.918
- Come on, come on!

33:31.959 --> 33:33.751
(moaning)

33:41.417 --> 33:44.125
- He's a cruel

33:41.417 --> 33:44.125
and dangerous person, Chaulk.

33:44.709 --> 33:46.167
You're not safe with him.

33:48.792 --> 33:52.167
He has taken me simply because

33:48.792 --> 33:52.167
I love a man he hates.

33:52.209 --> 33:53.876
And he will kill me for that.

33:54.709 --> 33:57.167
I don't think that'll sit well

33:54.709 --> 33:57.167
on your conscience.

33:58.792 --> 34:00.584
Look, I don't know you.

34:01.959 --> 34:03.959
But I know you must have

34:01.959 --> 34:03.959
dreams of a life.

34:04.500 --> 34:05.667
For yourself.

34:06.417 --> 34:08.000
For a family maybe?

34:09.417 --> 34:11.000
There's no life with Benton.

34:12.626 --> 34:14.250
You're no better than his slave.

34:20.626 --> 34:22.500
- Do you know the way

34:20.626 --> 34:22.500
to Fort James?

34:24.792 --> 34:26.083
- Why would we go there?

34:27.209 --> 34:29.167
- Because that's where

34:27.209 --> 34:29.167
your husband is.

34:30.000 --> 34:31.542
We're gonna need protection.

34:32.626 --> 34:35.083
- The only thing I need

34:32.626 --> 34:35.083
from that man is an annulment.

34:37.959 --> 34:41.834
We'll find a safe spot,

34:37.959 --> 34:41.834
not far from here...

34:37.959 --> 34:41.834
and we'll wait.

34:41.876 --> 34:43.083
- Wait?

34:44.167 --> 34:45.459
For what?

34:46.584 --> 34:48.250
- For Declan Harp.

34:51.417 --> 34:52.751
- You leaving in the morning?

34:52.792 --> 34:55.250
- Not quite sure

34:52.792 --> 34:55.250
when I'll be leaving.

34:56.042 --> 34:58.167
I'm waiting for something.

34:59.042 --> 35:00.125
- What?

35:01.042 --> 35:02.667
- A Black Wolf.

35:08.209 --> 35:10.167
- There's someone here

35:08.209 --> 35:10.167
to see you.

35:10.209 --> 35:12.876
Clenna Dolan is insisting

35:10.209 --> 35:12.876
she speak with you.

35:14.459 --> 35:16.959
- Alright. Ahem. Send her in.

35:28.584 --> 35:29.834
- Mr. Brown.

35:31.000 --> 35:32.250
- Ms. Dolan.

35:34.834 --> 35:36.834
What can I do to help you?

35:37.125 --> 35:38.918
- I wanted to return something.

35:40.834 --> 35:44.209
Mrs. Carruthers gave me this hat

35:40.834 --> 35:44.209
some time ago,

35:40.834 --> 35:44.209
when I worked for her.

35:44.792 --> 35:45.709
- Ha.

35:46.876 --> 35:50.083
She... had an eye for style,

35:46.876 --> 35:50.083
no mistake.

35:55.417 --> 35:58.626
- After what happened,

35:55.417 --> 35:58.626
I-I felt it wasn't right

35:55.417 --> 35:58.626
to keep it.

36:00.792 --> 36:02.167
I thought you should have it.

36:02.209 --> 36:03.500
- I thank you.

36:04.250 --> 36:06.083
- Hmm. How are things

36:04.250 --> 36:06.083
at the factory?

36:07.083 --> 36:11.209
- Oh... aside from the fact

36:07.083 --> 36:11.209
that there's no furs to process,

36:11.250 --> 36:14.334
or wages to pay anyone -

36:11.250 --> 36:14.334
I'd say it's going quite well,

36:11.250 --> 36:14.334
thank you.

36:15.959 --> 36:19.083
- Well, I owe your wife

36:15.959 --> 36:19.083
a great deal.

36:15.959 --> 36:19.083
I hope you know that.

36:20.417 --> 36:22.626
I was on my way

36:20.417 --> 36:22.626
back to London...

36:22.667 --> 36:24.542
I ran out of money for passage.

36:25.584 --> 36:29.250
I was utterly lost

36:25.584 --> 36:29.250
until she picked me up

36:25.584 --> 36:29.250
and took me in.

36:29.292 --> 36:32.959
- Only to see you fly

36:29.292 --> 36:32.959
into the arms of Samuel Grant.

36:35.417 --> 36:37.334
- It's quite complicated.

36:38.834 --> 36:41.959
I'd think you'd understand that

36:38.834 --> 36:41.959
more than most.

36:46.000 --> 36:47.709
Sorry to have bothered you.

36:47.751 --> 36:48.918
- Ms. Dolan.

36:52.375 --> 36:56.083
My wife never believed

36:52.375 --> 36:56.083
in half measures about anything.

36:56.125 --> 37:00.000
So if she gave this to you,

36:56.125 --> 37:00.000
she wanted you to keep it and...

37:01.876 --> 37:03.375
And so do I.

37:14.918 --> 37:16.375
(sighing)

37:19.709 --> 37:22.375
- It's my fault Vanstone stole

37:19.709 --> 37:22.375
your trade goods, Rivard.

37:23.876 --> 37:25.792
He came to the Lake Walkers

37:23.876 --> 37:25.792
looking for me.

37:26.667 --> 37:29.542
- Well,

37:26.667 --> 37:29.542
if you take a bite at them,

37:26.667 --> 37:29.542
they will bite back.

37:30.709 --> 37:34.000
Take a chunk of flesh

37:30.709 --> 37:34.000
from everybody like...

37:34.042 --> 37:35.709
sharks with wool coats!

37:37.083 --> 37:38.626
This is the way it is, Michael.

37:39.751 --> 37:43.083
The Natives and my people

37:39.751 --> 37:43.083
do all the work,

37:43.125 --> 37:45.542
and the... the English

37:43.125 --> 37:45.542
take the benefit.

37:46.209 --> 37:49.000
- Well, I plan to make it

37:46.209 --> 37:49.000
up to you. Somehow.

37:49.042 --> 37:51.000
- What can one man do, eh?

37:51.792 --> 37:53.584
Against such a force.

37:55.250 --> 37:57.417
- No one man can beat

37:55.250 --> 37:57.417
the HBC.

37:58.459 --> 37:59.626
Not one-on-one.

38:02.792 --> 38:03.751
- Good evening.

38:03.792 --> 38:06.417
No. No, please, we mean no harm.

38:06.959 --> 38:10.542
Already had enough muskets

38:06.959 --> 38:10.542
waved in our faces for one day.

38:14.417 --> 38:16.000
Oh, God bless ya.

38:26.834 --> 38:27.792
- Evening.

38:28.459 --> 38:29.500
- Hello.

38:30.584 --> 38:32.042
- Were you guys hit too?

38:32.083 --> 38:34.375
- Those bastards

38:32.083 --> 38:34.375
keep knocking us back.

38:34.417 --> 38:36.167
Took everything we got!

38:37.876 --> 38:39.042
Name's O'Reilly.

38:39.959 --> 38:41.876
And my wife, Kahwihta.

38:41.918 --> 38:42.792
- Madame.

38:43.959 --> 38:46.542
- Mercer.

38:43.959 --> 38:46.542
A few men from the outfit.

38:47.209 --> 38:48.250
- A few?

38:48.292 --> 38:50.167
- I got a few dozen more

38:48.292 --> 38:50.167
at camp.

38:51.292 --> 38:52.667
- And I'm Michael Smyth.

38:54.667 --> 38:55.918
This is my outfit.

38:57.375 --> 38:59.584
- I can do the work

38:57.375 --> 38:59.584
of a couple-dozen men.

39:00.083 --> 39:02.709
- Perhaps I should task you

39:00.083 --> 39:02.709
with kicking some English arse,

39:03.584 --> 39:05.292
get me fucking furs back!

39:05.334 --> 39:08.584
- Ah, nothing would give me

39:05.334 --> 39:08.584
more pleasure.

39:08.626 --> 39:12.792
- The Company's been making it

39:08.626 --> 39:12.792
harder on everyone to trade,

39:08.626 --> 39:12.792
starving people out.

39:13.292 --> 39:16.751
Before long, it won't be worth

39:13.292 --> 39:16.751
working on the lines anymore.

39:16.792 --> 39:18.709
- We should use their own

39:16.792 --> 39:18.709
techniques against them.

39:20.209 --> 39:23.125
Starve the HBC out.

39:20.209 --> 39:23.125
Choke out their trade...

39:23.667 --> 39:25.751
...break their arrangements

39:23.667 --> 39:25.751
with their partners.

39:25.792 --> 39:27.417
- Fine theory.

39:28.125 --> 39:29.792
- We need to form an alliance.

39:30.417 --> 39:33.334
With every independent company

39:30.417 --> 39:33.334
from here to the northwest.

39:35.959 --> 39:36.876
Us...

39:38.167 --> 39:40.417
...Rivard,

39:38.167 --> 39:40.417
and his access to the voyageurs.

39:45.667 --> 39:46.667
O'Reilly...

39:48.209 --> 39:50.375
How many men

39:48.209 --> 39:50.375
did you say you had?

39:51.250 --> 39:54.000
(shouting in the distance)

39:58.584 --> 39:59.751
- Wadlow!!

40:58.918 --> 41:00.417
(groaning)

41:19.959 --> 41:23.042
(soft music)

43:15.918 --> 43:18.042
(bird call echoing)

44:03.125 --> 44:04.667
(gushing)

44:23.667 --> 44:25.209
(grunting)

44:33.334 --> 44:34.209
- Charlie?!

44:36.792 --> 44:37.834
Charlie!

44:41.083 --> 44:42.459
Get McTaggart.

44:44.042 --> 44:45.375
We've gotta keep moving.

44:59.959 --> 45:01.125
Head out.

45:08.417 --> 45:10.250
- Harp! Dare I ask,

45:10.292 --> 45:13.209
when we get to Moose Fort,

45:10.292 --> 45:13.209
what's our plan?

45:13.834 --> 45:16.500
'Cause you know that place

45:13.834 --> 45:16.500
will be rammed with Redcoats!

45:16.959 --> 45:18.584
- The man makes a good point.

45:20.375 --> 45:21.500
- Harp!

45:22.584 --> 45:25.584
- What?

45:22.584 --> 45:25.584
- We're gonna need an army.

45:26.042 --> 45:28.042
- Fine. Let's go get an army.
