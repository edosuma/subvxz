00:08.360 --> 00:11.320
<i>- Jesus Beverly Christ,
- I'm starving.</i>

00:11.360 --> 00:13.700
- Do you want a juice box?
- Where was that an hour ago?

00:13.740 --> 00:14.950
- Ma'am.
- What?

00:14.990 --> 00:16.660
We have a lead on
a site for your library.

00:16.700 --> 00:18.160
Eastern Shore of Maryland.

00:18.200 --> 00:19.660
If it was any more
Kennedy-esque,

00:19.700 --> 00:20.990
it would drive you
into the ocean.

00:21.040 --> 00:22.950
Eastern Shore, very classy.

00:23.000 --> 00:25.870
Fittingly, I lost my
back-virginity in Assateague.

00:25.920 --> 00:27.330
I once lost my wallet in Denver.

00:27.380 --> 00:28.920
We need a down payment
of five mil.

00:28.960 --> 00:31.210
- Yeah.
- Ma'am, Tanz at 2:00.

00:31.260 --> 00:34.260
- Where?
- No, ma'am, you have a meeting with Tanz at 2:00.

00:34.300 --> 00:36.380
- Oh, thank you very much, Richard.
- Absolutely.

00:36.430 --> 00:38.680
President Meyer!
President Meyer!

00:38.720 --> 00:40.673
Can we get a few words
about the late Justice Tenny?

00:40.680 --> 00:43.430
Absolutely. He was a
friend to all people,

00:43.480 --> 00:47.770
especially corporations, who he
legally considered to be people.

00:47.810 --> 00:49.310
- Thank you.
- Madam President,

00:49.360 --> 00:50.603
any idea who President Montez
is considering

00:50.610 --> 00:52.360
for the open Supreme Court seat?

00:52.400 --> 00:54.940
No, no, no, no, no, there
is absolutely no validity

00:54.990 --> 00:58.700
to the rumor that the president
is being considered for the seat.

00:58.740 --> 01:00.910
- Do you mean President Meyer?
- Is that even a rumor?

01:00.950 --> 01:02.370
At this point,
that's all we can say.

01:02.410 --> 01:03.410
- Bye.
- Ma'am!

01:05.790 --> 01:08.137
- What in the holy fuck was that, Mike?
- I'm so sorry, ma'am.

01:08.170 --> 01:10.460
I just habitually deny
everything these days.

01:10.500 --> 01:12.000
It gets me in trouble
with Wendy, too.

01:12.050 --> 01:14.420
The other day, I flushed
a comb down the toilet.

01:14.470 --> 01:17.630
You know what I don't
need is examples.

01:17.680 --> 01:19.220
I do wanna hear
the end of that, though.

01:19.260 --> 01:22.010
No, no, there's absolutely
no validity to this rumor...

01:22.060 --> 01:24.513
Well, if you like, Jane, I can
float your name out there for you.

01:24.520 --> 01:26.480
You think I'd make a good judge?

01:26.520 --> 01:28.230
You do like
throwing books at people.

01:28.270 --> 01:31.520
When we return, more of that
signature Danny Egan wit.

01:31.570 --> 01:33.690
Plus, reading...

01:33.740 --> 01:36.740
could it be bad
for your child's self-esteem?

01:36.780 --> 01:39.070
Why one Texas housewife
wants to phase it out.

01:41.200 --> 01:43.490
- And we are clear.
- That was funny.

01:43.540 --> 01:45.493
- Not too far? - No, no, I said it
was funny, I meant it was funny.

01:45.500 --> 01:48.080
- Keep it up.
- Okay, here we go.

01:48.120 --> 01:49.873
I thought my charm campaign was
turning into a bit of a death march,

01:49.880 --> 01:51.920
but I think I breached
her defenses.

01:51.960 --> 01:54.250
<i>Stevie, when we
throw to commercial,</i>

01:54.300 --> 01:57.760
I want a full fucking
beaver shot with the legs.

01:57.800 --> 01:59.130
Otherwise, what is the point?

01:59.180 --> 02:00.590
Sorry, Jane.
Beave and legs, got it.

02:00.640 --> 02:02.053
I don't see that much
of a difference.

02:02.060 --> 02:03.760
I mean, she pretty much
likes everyone.

02:03.810 --> 02:05.513
I need her to like me. Can we
go easy on the bronzer, please?

02:05.520 --> 02:07.183
I'm starting to look like
a diversity hire here.

02:07.190 --> 02:09.092
I mean, Jane calls the shots,
and I wanna be taken seriously.

02:09.100 --> 02:10.520
- I get ya.
- If I wanted people

02:10.560 --> 02:11.813
to think that I actually
still cared about them,

02:11.820 --> 02:12.973
I would've stayed
in fucking politics.

02:12.980 --> 02:14.360
Here are the notes
on the kid chefs.

02:14.400 --> 02:16.070
I'd be careful.
A couple of them have colds.

02:16.110 --> 02:18.190
<i>I'm sweating my balls off here.</i>

02:18.240 --> 02:20.030
Is the air conditioning even on?

02:20.070 --> 02:21.363
- I'm gonna check.
- Look what time it is, ma'am.

02:21.370 --> 02:22.950
- What time?
- Memoir time.

02:22.990 --> 02:24.200
- Oh, God.
- Last time,

02:24.240 --> 02:25.990
you weren't comfortable
just talking,

02:26.040 --> 02:27.660
so I made a list of questions.

02:27.710 --> 02:29.410
- Oh, okay, fine.
- First one...

02:29.460 --> 02:31.460
- as a female, do you feel that...
- Pass!

02:31.500 --> 02:33.590
- Ma'am, Sherman Tanz is here.
<i>- Oh, my God.</i>

02:33.630 --> 02:35.543
- All right, get out of here, Mike.
- Great session.

02:35.550 --> 02:38.170
- Sherman!
- Madam Pardoner.

02:38.220 --> 02:39.800
Don't mention it.
Ever.

02:41.220 --> 02:43.680
- Come in, take a seat.
- Thanks.

02:43.720 --> 02:46.060
So, we have something to toast

02:46.100 --> 02:49.060
because we found
property for my library.

02:49.100 --> 02:51.940
Oh, wonderful! You know, I'm on
the board at the Nixon Library.

02:51.980 --> 02:53.940
- <i>Oh, good for you.</i>
- The miserable anti-Semite,

02:53.980 --> 02:55.940
- but a great friend of Israel.
- Yes, yes.

02:55.980 --> 02:57.480
So, how much do you need?

02:57.530 --> 02:59.400
Do you know, by the way,

02:59.450 --> 03:02.530
that my father was an
associate of Bebe Rebozo's?

03:02.570 --> 03:05.200
- Uh-huh, you're stalling.
It must be a big number.

03:05.240 --> 03:07.040
- No, I don't want it.
- You have back trouble?

03:07.080 --> 03:08.410
You know what helps?
Bananas.

03:08.460 --> 03:09.703
- Oh, is that so?
- The potassium.

03:09.710 --> 03:11.113
Oh, of course, yeah.
That makes sense.

03:11.120 --> 03:12.750
It's a little ache.
It's nothing.

03:12.790 --> 03:14.710
- If you're not using that...
- Oh, absolutely!

03:14.750 --> 03:16.583
- I never turn down a warm compress.
- Then take it.

03:16.590 --> 03:18.170
Let's give Mr. Tanz
a compress.

03:18.210 --> 03:21.090
- Sir, of course.
- Okay, good.

03:21.130 --> 03:23.220
What, no massage?

03:23.260 --> 03:25.640
- Gary, massage him.
- Mm-mm.

03:25.680 --> 03:26.720
Mm-hmm.

03:29.680 --> 03:32.560
I believe you were
about to mention a number.

03:32.600 --> 03:35.230
- Yes.
- Ooh. Ah.

03:35.270 --> 03:37.690
- Just go deep.
Just go deep for him, yes.

03:37.730 --> 03:39.730
<i>I was thinking in the ballpark</i>

03:39.780 --> 03:41.780
of maybe five million.

03:41.820 --> 03:43.320
- That's a big ballpark.
- Mm-hmm.

03:43.370 --> 03:44.910
Thank you.

03:44.950 --> 03:47.620
But I think five million
is swingable.

03:47.660 --> 03:51.750
Oh, bless your heart and
your deep pockets, Sherman.

03:51.790 --> 03:53.540
Now, listen, if there's anything

03:53.580 --> 03:56.080
- that I can ever do... okay, there we go.
- <i>Actually,</i>

03:56.130 --> 03:59.960
Madam President, because of the
actions of misguided reformers,

04:00.010 --> 04:02.090
our prison system
is in grave danger

04:02.130 --> 04:05.550
of dropping below
135% occupancy.

04:05.600 --> 04:08.050
Well, I think that I'm
partially to blame for that

04:08.100 --> 04:09.970
because I let you out of one.

04:10.020 --> 04:11.930
Montez is pushing hard
to put an end

04:11.980 --> 04:14.140
to for-profit prisons
and privatization.

04:14.190 --> 04:15.900
- It's madness!
- It's insane.

04:15.940 --> 04:18.019
I wanna find somebody to
make sure it does not happen.

04:18.070 --> 04:20.142
- Mm-hmm.
- Somebody from the Hill, preferably high up.

04:20.149 --> 04:22.740
Yeah, we can find you
a man or a woman,

04:22.780 --> 04:25.990
but it'll probably be a man
if you wanna get anything done.

04:26.030 --> 04:28.370
- Hang on a second. Richard?
<i>- Yes, ma'am?</i>

04:28.410 --> 04:32.160
Right, I want you to get in touch
with Ed McPherson on Judiciary

04:32.210 --> 04:33.910
'cause he's building
an infinity pool.

04:33.960 --> 04:35.750
- On it. Too late.
- Okey dokey.

04:35.790 --> 04:38.290
Madam President, don't let me
take any more of your time.

04:38.340 --> 04:41.840
- It's always a pleasure.
- It's always a tonic for me to see you.

04:41.880 --> 04:44.090
- Keep your chin up.
- Thank you.

04:44.130 --> 04:45.630
- What's happening?
- Oh, my God.

04:45.680 --> 04:47.720
- What's this?
- My back.

04:47.760 --> 04:49.930
- - Okay, get me a clean
compress now, please.

04:49.970 --> 04:51.723
- Ma'am, you're not gonna believe this.
- What?

04:51.730 --> 04:54.180
CNN just came out with
their speculative list

04:54.230 --> 04:56.520
of nominees for the open
Supreme Court seat...

04:56.560 --> 04:59.560
- <i>Yeah.</i> - ...and they have you
as a long shot's long shot.

04:59.610 --> 05:01.690
- You have gotta be kidding me.
- You're welcome.

05:01.740 --> 05:03.780
Gary, put CNN on right now.

05:03.820 --> 05:06.320
- Oh, it's cnn.com.
- Oh, well, nobody looks at that.

05:06.360 --> 05:07.700
Thanks for nothing, Mike.

05:07.740 --> 05:10.030
God damn it, you guys,
I am so hot.

05:10.080 --> 05:11.620
Oh.

05:11.660 --> 05:14.250
My tits feel like
these Hot Pockets.

05:14.290 --> 05:17.330
- Do we have any Hot Pockets?
- Well, ma'am, have you seen the doctor lately?

05:17.380 --> 05:21.880
- Because maybe it's meno... - Hey,
don't fucking say that, okay?

05:21.920 --> 05:23.500
<i>It's not that.
Seriously, that is like</i>

05:23.550 --> 05:25.970
a sexist-beyond-sexist
reaction.

05:26.010 --> 05:28.380
I'm just tired,
I'm uncomfortable,

05:28.430 --> 05:30.850
Mike's hair reminds me
of graham cracker crumbs.

05:30.890 --> 05:32.600
<i>I can't get any air in here</i>

05:32.640 --> 05:34.850
because all you people
are in here sucking it.

05:34.890 --> 05:36.180
Get out.
All of you, out!

05:36.230 --> 05:38.310
We'll hit the book later.

05:38.350 --> 05:40.473
- <i>Gary, where are you going?</i>
- Nowhere. I'm not, I'm not.

05:40.480 --> 05:42.230
Good news is
without the tampons,

05:42.280 --> 05:44.190
it's gonna free up
some space in my bag.

05:44.240 --> 05:45.740
Where are you gonna put yours?

05:46.950 --> 05:48.450
- I'm serious.
- Okay.

05:48.490 --> 05:51.160
Well, I do understand
that, Senator,

05:51.200 --> 05:52.950
but I know Sherman Tanz,

05:52.990 --> 05:54.910
perhaps in a way that
you don't know Sherman Tanz.

05:54.950 --> 05:57.210
- Excuse me.
- Oh, my God.

05:57.250 --> 06:00.330
I pardoned
"Typhoid Moishe."

06:00.380 --> 06:02.590
Richard!
Oh, I'm sorry.

06:02.630 --> 06:04.453
It's all right, ma'am.
How's your temperature been?

06:04.460 --> 06:05.999
- It's hot flashy.
- It's totally normal.

06:06.010 --> 06:07.373
Ma'am, I tried everyone
on the Finance Committee...

06:07.380 --> 06:08.633
- Yeah?
- ...and they all said no.

06:08.640 --> 06:09.720
All of them?!

06:09.760 --> 06:11.260
They all said no very fast.

06:11.300 --> 06:12.970
You have to check this out.
This is insane.

06:13.010 --> 06:15.100
What is it?

06:15.140 --> 06:18.350
Do you actually think former president
Selina Meyer could be a good choice?

06:18.390 --> 06:21.060
- Reaching across the aisle... <i>I'm
gonna need normal breaths, please.</i>

06:21.110 --> 06:22.690
I am breathing normally.

06:22.730 --> 06:25.530
Well, Meyer certainly would be
a super left field choice...

06:25.570 --> 06:27.400
Super left field?

06:27.450 --> 06:28.820
I mean, is that even a position?

06:28.860 --> 06:30.403
Mm-hmm, that was my
position in Little League.

06:30.410 --> 06:32.370
- I was a pitcher's helper.
- Aw.

06:32.410 --> 06:34.780
- This is insane, isn't it?
- I know! It's fucking absurd!

06:34.830 --> 06:37.160
Well, you don't have to agree
with me that strongly.

06:37.210 --> 06:39.460
Don't you guys have
something to do for Tanz?

06:39.500 --> 06:41.120
And if you don't find
anyone in the Senate,

06:41.170 --> 06:42.710
lift up the sewer grate
to the House.

06:42.750 --> 06:44.670
- Madam President.
- What? Oh.

06:44.710 --> 06:46.420
Okay.

06:46.460 --> 06:48.630
It's menopause?
Just get it over with.

06:48.680 --> 06:50.380
Write me a prescription
for Eileen Fisher

06:50.430 --> 06:52.470
and Fosamax and lube.

06:52.510 --> 06:53.970
It's a common mistake
among women

06:54.010 --> 06:55.593
with the sweating
and back pain at your age.

06:55.600 --> 06:57.640
Careful.

06:57.680 --> 07:00.053
Could you please just go and pack
everything up for me in that other room?

07:00.060 --> 07:02.310
- Go.
- Bye, Gary.

07:02.360 --> 07:05.610
- Whew, oh, boy.
- I suspect that this may be myocardial ischemia.

07:05.650 --> 07:07.570
It's a lack of oxygen
to the heart muscle.

07:07.610 --> 07:11.110
It's usually caused by
a partial arterial blockage.

07:11.160 --> 07:13.410
What, I'm so sor...
what?

07:13.450 --> 07:16.910
- What are you telling me?
- I think you had a small heart attack.

07:16.950 --> 07:18.540
- A heart attack?
- <i>Yes, ma'am.</i>

07:21.170 --> 07:23.330
So, I'm not menopausal?

07:23.380 --> 07:25.420
Well, no, but this is
far more serious.

07:25.460 --> 07:28.170
Well, hand me a cracker
and spread it up with

07:28.210 --> 07:30.420
"I Can't Believe
It's Not Menopause."

07:30.470 --> 07:32.833
- We need to get you to a hospital.
- You wanna knock me up, Doc?

07:32.840 --> 07:35.340
- Just 'cause I can do it.
- Ma'am, time is of the essence here.

07:35.390 --> 07:37.640
It's just a heart attack!
Gary! Gar...

07:37.680 --> 07:40.350
- Oh, Jesus.
- What is that?

07:40.390 --> 07:42.520
<i>Maybe my uterus is just wonky.</i>

07:42.560 --> 07:45.190
No, Catherine.
It's porcelain and perfect.

07:45.230 --> 07:46.230
Aw.

07:50.530 --> 07:52.860
You know what I like
about you two?

07:52.910 --> 07:55.240
- It's not clear who's the top.
- I am.

07:55.280 --> 07:57.160
<i>Oh, yeah.</i>

07:57.200 --> 07:58.490
Maybe we're just
doing this wrong.

07:58.540 --> 08:00.370
I mean, all these
tubes and jars.

08:00.410 --> 08:02.540
It just...
it doesn't feel organic.

08:02.580 --> 08:05.750
Well, we could
streamline the process.

08:05.790 --> 08:08.880
You could have direct sexual
intercourse with the donor.

08:08.920 --> 08:11.130
- Really?
- That's interesting.

08:11.170 --> 08:13.880
I mean, I guess if you think
that that would work.

08:13.930 --> 08:15.340
I'm... I'm willing
to try anything.

08:15.390 --> 08:17.720
Why don't we just
puppy pile, okay?

08:17.760 --> 08:20.180
Then we'll all get a bite
to eat afterwards, you know.

08:20.230 --> 08:22.350
See a movie or something.
You know, we'll make it nice.

08:22.390 --> 08:24.640
- It could be interesting.
<i>- Yeah.</i>

08:24.690 --> 08:27.020
- - He does have very delicate
features.

08:27.070 --> 08:28.270
- Thank you.
- Mr. Egan?

08:28.320 --> 08:29.820
- Yes, hi.
- Is it okay with you

08:29.860 --> 08:31.707
to discuss the results
altogether or would you...

08:31.740 --> 08:34.650
Sure, whatever. I'm just the cream
filling in this gay-claire.

08:36.320 --> 08:38.240
Well, your sperm count
looks normal,

08:38.280 --> 08:40.740
but the motility
is abnormally low,

08:40.789 --> 08:42.500
which means...
I'm sorry to say...

08:42.539 --> 08:46.210
it may be virtually impossible
for you to conceive.

08:46.250 --> 08:48.580
- Seriously?
- I'm so sorry, Dan.

08:48.630 --> 08:51.000
So, I've been pulling out
this entire time for nothing?

08:51.050 --> 08:52.840
Well, that has nothing...

08:52.880 --> 08:55.720
Oh, I am gonna save a fortune
in morning-after pills.

08:55.760 --> 08:58.220
There are, like, three girls
that owe me an abortion refund.

08:58.260 --> 09:00.220
Ladies, I am Danny Egan,

09:00.270 --> 09:01.890
- and I will see you
in the tomorrow.

09:03.430 --> 09:05.020
Doctor, can you
give us a minute?

09:05.060 --> 09:06.350
Certainly.

09:07.610 --> 09:08.850
Marjorie, I really think...

09:08.900 --> 09:10.820
Your mother had
a heart attack in DC.

09:15.660 --> 09:18.820
Oh, my God, I can't
believe I just did that.

09:18.870 --> 09:24.700
Um, uh, so we should go to
Washington probably, I guess.

09:24.750 --> 09:26.370
I guess.

09:31.710 --> 09:33.500
- Did I die?
- Here we go again.

09:33.550 --> 09:37.260
- Is this heaven?
- Yeah, he keeps waking up and asking that.

09:37.300 --> 09:40.220
You had a heart attack, Gary.

09:40.260 --> 09:42.680
For the third freaking time.

09:42.720 --> 09:44.310
- Oh, Jesus.
<i>- Madam President?</i>

09:44.350 --> 09:46.230
- Yes?
- You should really lie down.

09:46.270 --> 09:47.933
- Oh, I, you know... - What happened?
What happened?

09:47.940 --> 09:49.400
You had a heart attack, too?

09:49.440 --> 09:51.360
No, I had a heart episode

09:51.400 --> 09:53.270
and they're just gonna
pop a stent in there

09:53.320 --> 09:54.610
just for fun, and it's...

09:54.650 --> 09:56.280
- Here you go.
- Thank you so much.

09:56.320 --> 09:58.610
Can we get something
for Mr. Walsh, please?

09:58.660 --> 10:01.620
Because he's the one who's really
ailing and at death's door.

10:01.660 --> 10:03.483
- I'm... I am? I'm at death's door?
- <i>Yes, Madam President.</i>

10:03.490 --> 10:05.540
Oh, I'm at death's door?

10:05.580 --> 10:07.663
- Listen, if I don't make it...
- Gary, you're gonna be fine.

10:07.670 --> 10:09.710
- You have plenty to live for, too.
- - I do?

10:09.750 --> 10:11.460
Of course!

10:11.500 --> 10:16.260
Just think... next year, you get
to go to my library opening.

10:16.300 --> 10:19.880
- And you get to buy my book.
- Can't you just give me a copy?

10:19.930 --> 10:22.680
Well, I can't be giving out
free copies of the book

10:22.720 --> 10:24.673
'cause think of the position
that that would put me in.

10:24.680 --> 10:26.350
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- That's okay.

10:26.390 --> 10:29.850
And you're gonna have
a birthday next, um...

10:29.900 --> 10:31.900
- August.
- ...August.

10:31.940 --> 10:33.900
Good for you. That's right.
And you're gonna be...

10:33.940 --> 10:35.400
- 40.
- ...40.

10:35.440 --> 10:38.280
- You remembered.
- Yeah. You're only 40?

10:39.780 --> 10:41.660
And I'm gonna...
I'm gonna have a party.

10:41.700 --> 10:43.240
- Oh, really?
- In Alabama.

10:43.280 --> 10:45.280
Oh, Alabama.

10:45.330 --> 10:46.870
If I make it, will you come?

10:46.910 --> 10:49.580
Yes.

10:49.620 --> 10:51.920
- I will come.
- Madam President.

10:51.960 --> 10:54.210
- Yes?
- Ron Addis, Head of Cardiology.

10:54.250 --> 10:55.710
Oh, Head of Cardiology for him?

10:55.760 --> 10:57.880
No, ma'am.
I'll be placing your stent.

10:57.920 --> 11:01.470
Okay, thank God.
Yeah, let's get that done.

11:01.510 --> 11:02.760
Gary, you okay?

11:02.800 --> 11:05.850
Mm, yeah, good.
Thank you.

11:05.890 --> 11:09.270
Okay, if anybody asks, you just say I'm
in a routine closed-door meeting, okay?

11:09.310 --> 11:11.730
- Absolutely.
- If they're wondering why I'm at the hospital,

11:11.770 --> 11:15.310
you just put that on Gary 'cause he
had a massive heart attack, luckily.

11:15.360 --> 11:17.530
- <i>He's good, though, right?</i>
- Yes, ma'am.

11:17.570 --> 11:19.103
'Cause I don't know the alarm
code to get back into my house.

11:19.110 --> 11:21.200
Marjorie and Catherine
are on their way.

11:21.240 --> 11:24.160
- Ugh, just tell them I'm in a meeting, too.
- All right, got it.

11:24.200 --> 11:27.330
- No photos!
- I was accessing her medical history.

11:27.370 --> 11:28.910
Ma'am, Sherman Tanz
called again.

11:28.960 --> 11:30.790
Oh, God.
Where are we with that?

11:30.830 --> 11:32.790
- All nos.
- Yeah, just like his face.

11:32.830 --> 11:34.630
We need to give him a name
or we lose him.

11:34.670 --> 11:37.130
- All righty, time to go.
<i>- Okay.</i>

11:37.170 --> 11:39.710
Just give him that
whale dong Jonah, my God.

11:39.760 --> 11:41.970
- Oh, good luck.
- I'm fine.

11:42.010 --> 11:44.180
- Get well soon.
- Thank you so much, Richard.

11:44.220 --> 11:46.220
Hey, I have...

11:48.430 --> 11:50.310
You can just...
just close that, okay?

11:50.350 --> 11:52.100
<i>She never stops talking.</i>

11:52.150 --> 11:54.770
No! No, no, no.
That's not what I want...

11:54.810 --> 11:56.360
she didn't even...

11:58.070 --> 11:59.563
- What are you doing?
- I'm calling Jonah.

11:59.570 --> 12:00.690
No.

12:00.740 --> 12:02.030
<i>Well, well, well.</i>

12:02.070 --> 12:03.860
If it isn't the prodigal traitor

12:03.910 --> 12:06.490
come back home to suck on my
giant congressional ball.

12:06.530 --> 12:08.160
No, it's Richard Splett.

12:08.200 --> 12:10.240
I'm calling on behalf
of President Selina Meyer.

12:10.290 --> 12:12.113
- <i>You remember her. She's the former...</i>
- Hold on.

12:12.120 --> 12:14.580
- I have a more important call coming in.
- Oh, okay.

12:16.210 --> 12:17.500
Well, well, well.

12:17.550 --> 12:19.250
If it isn't the prodigal
ex-girlfriend

12:19.300 --> 12:20.840
come home to suck on my giant...

12:20.880 --> 12:23.170
Listen, jizz clot,
I can't believe I'm saying this,

12:23.220 --> 12:25.430
but you're gonna have
a meeting with Sherman Tanz.

12:25.470 --> 12:26.843
Is this the same thing
that Richard's calling about?

12:26.850 --> 12:28.930
No idea.
Just stay on with me.

12:28.970 --> 12:31.223
This is your chance to get back
in President Meyer's good graces.

12:31.230 --> 12:32.390
Hey.

12:32.440 --> 12:34.060
Who is Sherman Tanz?

12:34.100 --> 12:36.520
Private prison and pay day
lending magnate,

12:36.560 --> 12:38.560
Israel hyper-enthusiast,
billionaire,

12:38.610 --> 12:40.320
convicted of tax fraud.

12:40.360 --> 12:42.103
Yeah, when people think about
what's wrong in Washington,

12:42.110 --> 12:43.990
they think of him and you.

12:44.030 --> 12:46.410
Association with Tanz
spells disaster.

12:46.450 --> 12:47.604
So, I shouldn't meet with him?

12:49.450 --> 12:52.500
Well, for you, Congressman,
disaster would be a step up.

12:52.540 --> 12:55.080
Are you asking
Ben and Kent who he is?

12:55.120 --> 12:57.670
No.
He's a prison magnet.

12:57.710 --> 12:59.340
<i>Hello?</i>

12:59.380 --> 13:01.380
Oh, someone has call waiting.

13:01.420 --> 13:03.170
- This is Splett.
- Hey, buddy.

13:03.220 --> 13:05.630
Help me out with this Selina
Ross and the Supremes insanity.

13:05.680 --> 13:08.760
Apparently, someone saw President
Meyer's name on McPherson's call sheet,

13:08.800 --> 13:10.600
and he's the chair
of the Judiciary Committee.

13:10.640 --> 13:12.593
I'm sorry, could you repeat
everything after "Hey, buddy"?

13:12.600 --> 13:14.093
- Oh, shit, hold on one sec. Jane?
- Yeah?

13:14.100 --> 13:15.643
Chocolate chip
walnut cookies from Levain.

13:15.650 --> 13:17.730
Mm-hmm.

13:17.770 --> 13:20.810
- You're lucky I have
such a great ass.

13:20.860 --> 13:23.150
All right, so tell me, is there
any truth at all to this?

13:23.190 --> 13:25.733
All I can tell you is that President
Meyer is in a closed-door meeting.

13:25.740 --> 13:27.910
Wait, so this
Supreme Court shit's real?

13:27.950 --> 13:32.870
All I can tell you is President
Meyer is in a closed-door...

13:32.910 --> 13:34.370
hello?

13:34.410 --> 13:36.540
Oh, I better get back
to Mr. Ryan.

13:41.840 --> 13:44.420
Hey, guys, I have
insider confirmation

13:44.470 --> 13:47.510
that Selina Meyer is being considered
for the open Supreme Court seat.

13:47.550 --> 13:49.340
To what, reupholster it?

13:49.390 --> 13:50.753
Write it up real quick and then,
Jane, you can lead with it.

13:50.760 --> 13:53.470
Actually, I think Danny
should run with it.

13:53.520 --> 13:55.430
It's his source, it's his story.

13:55.480 --> 13:57.640
- Really?
- But I will take the zoo animal segment.

13:57.690 --> 14:00.190
- Professor Parrot, yes.
- Jane, are you sure? This is huge.

14:00.230 --> 14:02.060
If I am speaking, I am sure.

14:02.110 --> 14:03.940
Sorry, Jane.
Of course you're sure. Okay.

14:03.990 --> 14:06.440
Danny is my man.

14:06.490 --> 14:08.990
- Jane, thank you.
- Mm.

14:10.700 --> 14:13.330
Oh, also, can we do something
about my makeup girl

14:13.370 --> 14:15.450
and her Hinckley-esque
obsession with bronzer?

14:15.500 --> 14:17.703
She's not going anywhere. She's
the head makeup artist's niece.

14:17.710 --> 14:19.783
I'm starting to look like I should be
auditioning for a telenovela here.

14:19.790 --> 14:21.243
Why don't you talk to Jane?
You're her man.

14:21.250 --> 14:23.460
Yeah, right.

14:23.500 --> 14:26.731
Which is actually great because I have this
really killer piece I wanna do on Rwanda.

14:33.510 --> 14:35.180
Hi.

14:35.220 --> 14:37.430
Hi. What... what is my
password for my phone?

14:37.480 --> 14:39.020
- Hello, ma'am.
- Hi!

14:39.060 --> 14:40.730
- How are you feeling?
- Oh, honey.

14:40.770 --> 14:43.980
Oh! You got me
some bodega flowers?

14:44.030 --> 14:46.650
They're actually from
a very expensive boutique.

14:46.690 --> 14:48.900
Oh, okay, well, I like them,
wherever they're from.

14:48.950 --> 14:51.740
- We can just give them to Gary.
- Aw, thank you.

14:51.780 --> 14:54.280
- Ma'am, more Court questions.
- Ma'am, this is getting silly.

14:54.330 --> 14:57.750
Montez is not gonna name someone from the
opposite party to the Supreme Court.

14:57.790 --> 15:01.170
- We need to all just chill out and...
- Uh, Montez is on TV.

15:01.210 --> 15:04.040
I can't comment on
the nomination process.

15:04.090 --> 15:08.170
However, I remain committed
to reaching across the aisle.

15:08.220 --> 15:11.800
- Fuck my ears.
- She just said reaching across the aisle.

15:11.840 --> 15:14.090
Whoo, that Montez
is a Latin piece of ass.

15:14.140 --> 15:17.310
Okay, he's hallucinating. Come
here, come here, come out here.

15:17.350 --> 15:19.930
What... what is going on here?
What is our next move?

15:19.980 --> 15:23.270
Ma'am, Senator Hallowes from Judiciary
wants to set a meeting to pre-vet.

15:23.310 --> 15:25.900
No! This means
I'm on the short list?!

15:25.940 --> 15:30.400
- What? I'm on the short list!
- Peek-a-boo, peek-a-boo!

15:30.450 --> 15:33.280
Madam President, may I say from one
vet to another, congratulations.

15:33.320 --> 15:34.950
Oh, God, this is the second act

15:34.990 --> 15:37.790
that Selina Meyer
finally deserves.

15:37.830 --> 15:39.200
And we gotta play this smart.

15:39.250 --> 15:41.410
- Madam President.
- Hello. How are you?

15:41.460 --> 15:43.370
- Gary Walsh?
- Yeah.

15:43.420 --> 15:46.500
- If you will just sign here, please.
- "Yas," queen.

15:46.550 --> 15:48.340
We'll go over
your discharge plans,

15:48.380 --> 15:49.913
- your after care, your medications.
- Okay.

15:49.920 --> 15:50.960
Okay.

15:51.010 --> 15:53.010
- Um, Gary?
- <i>Hmm?</i>

15:53.050 --> 15:56.220
Do you have someone at home
who can take care of you?

15:56.260 --> 15:59.970
Yes, my roommates
Stashelle, Lark, and Boosh.

16:00.020 --> 16:01.020
You have three roommates?

16:01.060 --> 16:03.600
We share a studio in Hoboken.

16:03.650 --> 16:05.060
Your mom doesn't think
you're pretty,

16:05.110 --> 16:06.610
but I think you're stunning.

16:06.650 --> 16:08.860
Thank you.

16:08.900 --> 16:10.860
This isn't unprecedented either,

16:10.900 --> 16:13.593
because President Taft was on the
Supreme Court after he was president.

16:13.610 --> 16:16.120
Yeah, and what's the first
thing you remember about him?

16:16.160 --> 16:18.363
- He got stuck in a bathtub? - No, well,
the second thing you remember about him.

16:18.370 --> 16:20.870
- He was buried in a piano case.
- No, that's not right.

16:20.910 --> 16:22.250
- Mom?
- What?

16:22.290 --> 16:23.323
Gary's gonna stay with us
in the brownstone

16:23.330 --> 16:24.670
until he gets better.

16:24.710 --> 16:26.580
Okay, what's happening
right now?

16:26.630 --> 16:28.960
I'm... go call Hallowes

16:29.000 --> 16:31.380
and tell her Selina will
meet with her next Monday.

16:31.420 --> 16:33.720
- Your Hallowes impression.
- It's spot-on.

16:33.760 --> 16:36.293
- It's hilarious. - Ooh, Monday, it's
the day after Daylight Saving Time.

16:36.300 --> 16:37.593
It's my favorite holiday
'cause it's like living

16:37.600 --> 16:39.220
in a tiny version
of "Back to the Future."

16:39.270 --> 16:41.350
He can't go all the
way back to Hoboken.

16:41.390 --> 16:42.890
- Hi!
- New Jersey?

16:42.940 --> 16:44.553
What are you talking about?
You live in New Jersey?

16:44.560 --> 16:45.980
You're at the brownstone
by 6:00.

16:46.020 --> 16:47.350
I leave
a little after 4:00,

16:47.400 --> 16:49.440
- I catch the 4:28 PATH...
- <i>Okay.</i>

16:49.480 --> 16:52.070
...then I take the F to the 6,
and then I do a quick jaunt,

16:52.110 --> 16:54.070
and I'm there in time
to steep the tea...

16:54.110 --> 16:55.530
- Mom.
- What?

16:55.570 --> 16:57.280
What...
oh, my God, fine!

16:57.320 --> 16:58.613
Put him in the basement.
I don't give a shit.

16:58.620 --> 17:00.780
Fine, the basement.
Who gives a shit?

17:00.830 --> 17:03.040
- I love the basement.
- What is my password?

17:03.080 --> 17:05.329
Okay.

17:06.790 --> 17:08.540
<i>Give my regards to everybody</i>

17:08.589 --> 17:10.500
on the Judiciary Committee.

17:10.550 --> 17:12.339
Oh, of course, Madam President.

17:12.380 --> 17:14.380
- Be well.
- Oh, I'm well. I'm weller than well.

17:14.430 --> 17:16.380
- I love your scarf.
- Eileen Fisher.

17:16.430 --> 17:18.180
- Oh, it's so chic.
- Buh-bye.

17:18.220 --> 17:19.640
Buh-bye.

17:19.680 --> 17:21.510
I feel like my chest
has been trampled

17:21.560 --> 17:23.470
in a Puerto Rican
nightclub fire.

17:23.520 --> 17:26.480
It's like I'm breathing through
a tiny straw, you know?

17:26.520 --> 17:29.610
Oh, a straw. Yeah, I want
a water with a straw.

17:29.650 --> 17:31.360
- Uh-huh.
- So, that went well.

17:31.400 --> 17:33.433
- That went really well.
- Ma'am, Sherman Tanz called.

17:33.440 --> 17:36.280
Well, tell Sherman Tanz
I don't need a library anymore.

17:36.320 --> 17:38.523
- Ma'am, I'm sure it'll be fun.
- No, a library is good for you.

17:38.530 --> 17:41.070
No, my legacy, guys,
is me in a robe,

17:41.120 --> 17:44.540
taking guns from this guy, giving
the death penalty to that guy.

17:44.580 --> 17:48.250
And they can't vote me out, right?
It's for life.

17:48.290 --> 17:49.743
<i>They're gonna have to
carry me out of there</i>

17:49.750 --> 17:52.710
with the gavel clenched
in my cold, dead twat.

17:52.760 --> 17:56.220
Oh, Gary, I need you to move
all of these law review boxes.

17:56.260 --> 17:57.470
- <i>Love to, yeah.</i>
- Ow!

17:57.510 --> 18:00.090
See, now it hurts
for me to point.

18:00.140 --> 18:02.213
That muscle's called the brachioradialis.
At least it is in cats.

18:02.220 --> 18:04.390
Do you want me to get you
some arnica ointment?

18:04.430 --> 18:06.133
- Yeah, that would be good.
<i>And for the vetting...</i>

18:06.140 --> 18:08.390
- Yeah.
- ...the Judiciary Committee

18:08.440 --> 18:10.303
has asked to send them everything
that you've ever written on abortion.

18:10.310 --> 18:12.270
Well, I can give them
my actual abortion

18:12.320 --> 18:13.973
if I could find it
lying around here somewhere.

18:13.980 --> 18:15.320
I'll check the freezer.

18:15.360 --> 18:17.150
Ma'am, picked by
the Supreme Court.

18:17.200 --> 18:19.200
I mean, that's
a twist ending to the book.

18:19.240 --> 18:20.740
<i>I know.
Although, you know what?</i>

18:20.780 --> 18:22.320
If I'm going to be a Supreme,

18:22.370 --> 18:24.370
I don't really think
we need to finish this book.

18:24.410 --> 18:26.290
Oh, we do.
We do, ma'am.

18:26.330 --> 18:28.330
Oh, no, it isn't upstairs, Gary.

18:28.370 --> 18:30.210
It's in the bathroom
off of the kitchen.

18:30.250 --> 18:31.703
- 'Cour... yeah, sure.
<i>- Everybody reads.</i>

18:31.710 --> 18:34.040
Now, ma'am, we can get
this book done so fast.

18:34.090 --> 18:36.880
Not at the rate you guys are going now.
- It's in the bathroom upstairs.

18:36.920 --> 18:40.260
Yeah.
- Just forget that for right now, okay?

18:40.300 --> 18:41.220
Give that a break.

18:42.470 --> 18:44.390
- Oh, my God.
- Whoo!

18:44.430 --> 18:47.470
I'm sorry, Mama.
Bunny's late for middle school.

18:47.520 --> 18:49.560
I'll see you later.

18:49.600 --> 18:51.400
Uh, Gary?

18:51.440 --> 18:53.110
Okay, okay, okay.

18:53.150 --> 18:56.320
Do you know where
my water with the straw is?

18:56.360 --> 18:58.570
<i>Good morning, Team Ryan.</i>

18:58.610 --> 19:00.320
Tell me what gets
this Tanz guy's dick hard.

19:00.360 --> 19:02.700
Being on time,
Congressman Dachau.

19:02.740 --> 19:04.903
You're an hour late. He's been sitting
in your office the whole time.

19:04.910 --> 19:06.910
Was an hour ago.

19:06.950 --> 19:08.370
58 minutes.

19:08.410 --> 19:11.330
Do I need to timesplain
clock reading to you two?

19:11.380 --> 19:13.710
The big hand points to the noon

19:13.750 --> 19:16.170
and the little hand
points to the...

19:16.210 --> 19:19.340
Well, fuck, it's the...
God, it's 10:00 AM.

19:19.380 --> 19:21.220
You didn't set
your watch forward.

19:21.260 --> 19:23.140
- Happy Daylight Savings Time.
- Saving.

19:23.180 --> 19:24.843
- Whatever.
- Oh, shit, Daylight Savings Time is today?

19:24.850 --> 19:27.010
Saving,
and it started yesterday.

19:27.060 --> 19:30.310
Okay, well, there is literally no
way that I could've known that.

19:30.350 --> 19:32.850
- Hello, sir.
- 59 minutes.

19:32.900 --> 19:34.400
That's how long
I've been sitting here

19:34.440 --> 19:36.690
waiting for a man
that nobody should wait for.

19:36.730 --> 19:38.483
- Sir, I'm so sorry. My senior staff...
- <i>Never apologize.</i>

19:38.490 --> 19:41.150
Sorry betrays a weak spirit.
Have a seat, Congressman.

19:41.200 --> 19:43.700
Okay, but you're in...

19:46.700 --> 19:49.370
- Fine.
- Nice of you to fit me into your busy schedule.

19:49.410 --> 19:52.870
Okay, see, when you say that, it makes
me think that I should be apologizing.

19:52.920 --> 19:56.340
Don't worry, I like to judge a man
by looking him right in the eyes.

19:56.380 --> 19:58.170
Okay.

20:02.760 --> 20:05.470
Are you gonna make a campaign
contribution or what?

20:05.510 --> 20:07.720
You know what?
I am.

20:07.770 --> 20:10.020
Getting paid, getting laid, son.

20:11.230 --> 20:13.810
Congressman Jonah Ryan.

20:13.850 --> 20:18.900
Zero dollars and one cent.

20:18.940 --> 20:21.780
Did you have a stroke,
you weird asshole man?

20:21.820 --> 20:24.450
You stuck around here
for an hour just to be a dick?

20:24.490 --> 20:25.950
I did.

20:25.990 --> 20:27.570
You didn't even sign this.

20:27.620 --> 20:29.030
Maybe you should've apologized.

20:29.080 --> 20:30.990
You told me not to!

20:31.040 --> 20:34.250
- Ding-dong! Dinner is served!
<i>What?</i>

20:34.290 --> 20:36.250
You should not be
in the maid's quarters.

20:36.290 --> 20:37.960
- I know.
- Oh, let me help, let me help.

20:38.000 --> 20:39.920
- No, no, no, Gary, sit.
- No, no, no, you sit.

20:39.960 --> 20:42.550
- No, Gary, sit!
- All right, let's both sit.

20:42.590 --> 20:44.680
Lookie looksters!

20:44.720 --> 20:46.930
- Oh, my gosh!
- Yeah.

20:46.970 --> 20:49.260
This looks delicious.
What is it?

20:49.310 --> 20:52.520
Oh, I cut up a chicken sandwich
and I put it into pasta.

20:52.560 --> 20:54.600
What?

20:54.650 --> 20:57.810
Is this the chicken sandwich that was
in the fridge before the hospital?

20:57.860 --> 21:02.400
Wow, and you left the bun
on it when you cut it.

21:04.820 --> 21:06.733
Well, you don't have to finish
it if you don't think it's...

21:06.740 --> 21:10.490
No, no, no, I can't wait to swirl
my fork in there and get in.

21:10.540 --> 21:13.700
Let me see. Mm.

21:15.540 --> 21:17.580
Smells sort of funky,
though, no?

21:17.630 --> 21:20.290
It's the bleu cheese.

21:20.340 --> 21:22.050
No, but there isn't
any bleu cheese in it.

21:24.680 --> 21:27.340
You must be...

21:27.390 --> 21:29.390
starving yourself, though.

21:29.430 --> 21:30.800
- Oh, no, I ate.
- You did?

21:30.850 --> 21:33.100
Yeah, a chef made me
some grilled salmon

21:33.140 --> 21:35.060
and some asparagus
with a béarnaise sauce.

21:35.100 --> 21:37.640
- It was heavenly. It was really delicious.
- Okay.

21:37.690 --> 21:39.563
I mean, I couldn't finish it.
I just threw the rest out.

21:39.570 --> 21:40.690
You did? Okay.

21:40.730 --> 21:42.610
Where is your water?

21:42.650 --> 21:45.990
Ugh, I don't have any. There's
just bottles in the kitchen.

21:46.030 --> 21:48.320
Oh.

21:48.370 --> 21:50.030
- Yeah, I'll go.
- No, no, no, I'll go.

21:50.080 --> 21:51.660
No, no, no,
I'm gonna go, really.

21:51.700 --> 21:53.830
Okay? I'm just...
I just wanna wait a minute.

21:53.870 --> 21:57.710
Okay.
That's really sweet.

21:57.750 --> 21:59.080
<i>We've got full queen</i>

21:59.130 --> 22:01.540
<i>and king pillow top sets
for 599,</i>

22:01.590 --> 22:02.960
<i>and a king memory foam...</i>

22:03.010 --> 22:04.840
Apparently, the state senator

22:04.880 --> 22:06.340
was against gay marriage

22:06.380 --> 22:09.090
and paying his gay escort.

22:09.140 --> 22:12.600
- We'll be right back.
- And we're clear. Great.

22:12.640 --> 22:14.850
No. Unless it's an eraser,
go away.

22:14.890 --> 22:17.520
- I don't want it.
- Danny, I saw that piece that you did on Rwanda.

22:17.560 --> 22:19.553
- It's very powerful.
- You did? Fantastic! I'm so glad you like it.

22:19.560 --> 22:21.770
- Oh, you know what? Real quick...
- A lot of research.

22:21.820 --> 22:23.770
- Very powerful.
- You gotta try one of these.

22:23.820 --> 22:25.360
Just say yes.

22:25.400 --> 22:26.940
You will be the death of me.

22:26.990 --> 22:28.150
Ugh!

22:29.780 --> 22:31.280
- Cookie?
- Is that what she calls you

22:31.330 --> 22:33.580
when she puts her penis
in your vagina?

22:33.620 --> 22:35.700
What? What are you
talking about?

22:35.750 --> 22:38.040
We all know about you and Jane.
You guys are together.

22:38.080 --> 22:39.783
Come on, I haven't slept with a
woman over 30 since I was 14,

22:39.790 --> 22:41.210
and that's 'cause
I needed the grade.

22:41.250 --> 22:43.710
Bronzina's fired.
You're welcome.

22:43.750 --> 22:45.500
You're so tapping that.

22:45.550 --> 22:47.170
<i>Okay, camera two.</i>

23:37.560 --> 23:38.970
<i>- Where have you been?
- Why?</i>

23:39.020 --> 23:40.600
Did I miss the French toast
dippy things?

23:40.640 --> 23:42.520
- You're two hours late.
- No, that's impossible.

23:42.560 --> 23:44.600
I set my watch back
for Daylight Savings Time.

23:44.650 --> 23:46.813
- Saving, not savings.
- You set your watch the wrong way.

23:46.820 --> 23:49.480
- It's neither a plural, nor a possessive.
- No, it's spring.

23:49.530 --> 23:51.860
- I "springed" backwards.
- No, you spring forward!

23:51.910 --> 23:54.700
Have ever watched girls gymnastics?
That makes no sense.

23:54.740 --> 23:56.702
You could just get the correct
time from your phone.

23:56.740 --> 23:58.240
Oh, could I?

23:58.290 --> 24:00.450
Well, guess what,
my phone fell in the toilet,

24:00.500 --> 24:02.710
so who's the fucking
smart guy now, Kent?

24:02.750 --> 24:04.827
Hey, hey, hey, listen to me,
you plus-sized homunculus.

24:04.840 --> 24:06.380
- Plus-sized what?
- Homunculus.

24:06.420 --> 24:08.210
A human-shaped creature
of medieval legend

24:08.260 --> 24:11.170
that Paracelsus claimed was
created from putrefied sperm.

24:11.220 --> 24:12.883
- How do you both know that?
- Not now, not now.

24:12.890 --> 24:15.180
If you don't want that reporter
to write a story titled

24:15.220 --> 24:18.180
"Granite State Represented
by Twinless Tower,"

24:18.220 --> 24:20.850
then you better get over there,
dip his cock in some maple syrup,

24:20.890 --> 24:22.310
- and start sucking.
- Fine.

24:22.350 --> 24:24.480
Hey, Union Leader, come here.

24:24.520 --> 24:26.770
Take this down.

24:26.820 --> 24:28.480
I'm not gonna suck your dick.

24:28.530 --> 24:30.650
The only one who should be
sucking your dick

24:30.690 --> 24:31.990
is Daylight Savings Time.

24:32.030 --> 24:34.030
And I don't give a fuck
if that means

24:34.070 --> 24:37.870
that some farmer in Kansas has to milk
his cow using a fucking flashlight.

24:37.910 --> 24:40.160
<i>I've had my own bedtime
since I was 17.</i>

24:40.200 --> 24:42.354
I didn't need a babysitter then
and I don't need one now,

24:42.370 --> 24:45.960
and it's high time that the government
stop trying to babysit all of us.

24:48.710 --> 24:50.420
That was all off the record.

24:50.460 --> 24:52.510
<i>Ma'am, "New York Times"
says Montez</i>

24:52.550 --> 24:53.840
is naming the nominee today.

24:53.880 --> 24:55.050
- Eh.
- "Buzzfeed" confirms.

24:55.090 --> 24:57.510
- Oh, my God, really?
- Yeah.

24:57.550 --> 24:59.883
- We should be getting a phone call any minute.
- Ooh, my heart is racing!

24:59.890 --> 25:01.430
- I bet this time,
it's just menopause.

25:01.480 --> 25:03.100
- President Meyer's office.
<i>- Ooh.</i>

25:03.140 --> 25:05.140
Yep, she's right here.
It's Candi Caruso.

25:05.190 --> 25:07.310
- Don't say that I'm here.
- You are here, though.

25:07.360 --> 25:09.150
Candi? Uh-huh.

25:09.190 --> 25:11.610
Oh, that's fantastic!

25:11.650 --> 25:14.240
Okay, thank you.
Bye-bye.

25:14.280 --> 25:17.450
Get Shylock Tanz
on the phone right now!

25:17.490 --> 25:20.370
- What?
- I don't know who Montez picked,

25:20.410 --> 25:21.870
but it sure as tits wasn't me.

25:21.910 --> 25:24.000
I need that money
for the library ASAP. Go!

25:24.040 --> 25:25.790
I think his name
is Sherman Tanz.

25:25.830 --> 25:28.670
Fuck Montez and that fake
bur... burrow...

25:28.710 --> 25:31.170
whatever you call
those donkeys they ride in on.

25:31.210 --> 25:32.960
- Bureaus.
<i>- Burro?</i>

25:33.010 --> 25:34.923
It would've been a shame to
hide that body under a robe.

25:34.930 --> 25:36.220
- You know?
- Okay, yes.

25:36.260 --> 25:37.590
Sherman Tanz on line one.

25:37.640 --> 25:41.430
All right, here we go.
Sherman, hello!

25:41.470 --> 25:43.470
I wanna give you
some exciting news.

25:43.520 --> 25:46.390
<i>We have secured the property
for the Meyer Library.</i>

25:46.440 --> 25:49.230
Ugh, that's sensational! Listen,
I have something to tell you.

25:49.270 --> 25:50.900
- I get it.
- <i>You do?</i>

25:50.940 --> 25:52.440
And I want you to remind me

25:52.480 --> 25:54.190
what it is exactly
that you're getting.

25:54.240 --> 25:56.780
Jonah Ryan.
He's young, he's raw,

25:56.820 --> 25:58.740
he's a fresh,
if slightly deformed, face

25:58.780 --> 26:00.660
that I can ride
like a hobby horse.

26:00.700 --> 26:03.410
Did you see his nonsense
about the Daylight Savings?

26:03.450 --> 26:06.330
- I love this guy.
- We all do.

26:06.370 --> 26:09.710
- <i>This coastal property...</i> - Selina, I can't
do the whole five mil by myself anymore.

26:09.750 --> 26:13.210
- Seriously?
- I am all in on Jonah Ryan, and I owe you one.

26:13.260 --> 26:16.010
- <i>Okay?</i>
- Yeah, that was the fucking point, Sherman.

26:16.050 --> 26:18.590
- <i>Bye!</i>
- Okay?

26:18.640 --> 26:22.100
- Oh, here it is. - ...has
nominated President Stuart Hughes

26:22.140 --> 26:24.140
for the Supreme Court seat
left empty

26:24.180 --> 26:26.430
<i>by the death of Justice Tenny.</i>

26:26.480 --> 26:28.180
Ow.

26:28.230 --> 26:30.770
Aw, well, at least you
made the short list.

26:32.270 --> 26:33.570
How are you feeling, by the way?

26:33.610 --> 26:34.770
Good.

26:34.820 --> 26:36.530
- Then shut the fuck up.
- Uh-huh.

26:36.570 --> 26:38.240
On the bright side,
it's gonna be an amazing

26:38.280 --> 26:39.523
new exhibit
at the Hughes Library.

26:39.530 --> 26:40.740
<i>Turn this off.</i>

26:40.780 --> 26:43.160
Danny Egan takes
an unflinching look

26:43.200 --> 26:45.740
at Rwanda 20 years later.

26:45.790 --> 26:47.370
Thank you, Jane.

26:47.410 --> 26:49.830
The Rwandan genocide ended
over two decades ago,

26:49.880 --> 26:51.830
but for Jean Pierre Magambo,

26:51.880 --> 26:54.170
<i>the nightmares never end.</i>

26:54.210 --> 26:55.920
Good morning.

26:55.960 --> 26:57.630
Good morning.

26:57.670 --> 27:00.430
Look,
it's 9:00 AM, right?

27:00.470 --> 27:01.800
- Yes, it is.
<i>- Mm-hmm.</i>

27:01.850 --> 27:04.850
Okay, great.
Who are all these people?

27:04.890 --> 27:06.850
I told you I didn't wanna
meet with anybody.

27:06.890 --> 27:08.390
They are from Tanz.

27:08.440 --> 27:10.730
You've got economists, staffers,

27:10.770 --> 27:12.690
even a couple
of scientists, right?

27:12.730 --> 27:17.190
And they have written you
a piece of legislation.

27:17.240 --> 27:18.610
Oof.

27:21.990 --> 27:23.240
Cool.

27:23.280 --> 27:25.080
Wait, do I have to
read all this?

27:25.120 --> 27:27.450
- Your choice.
- Fine.

27:28.960 --> 27:30.750
Hello.
Thanks for this.

27:30.790 --> 27:32.620
Thank you.

27:32.670 --> 27:34.250
Mr. Speaker,

27:34.290 --> 27:39.300
Daylight Saving...
not plural... Time

27:39.340 --> 27:42.430
has never saved us
from anything,

27:42.470 --> 27:45.350
certainly not
the higher energy costs

27:45.390 --> 27:46.810
it promised to lower.

27:46.850 --> 27:49.100
Statistically, there is proof

27:49.140 --> 27:51.480
that the twice yearly
time change

27:51.520 --> 27:54.770
leads to increased accidents.

27:54.820 --> 27:56.770
And furthermore,

27:56.820 --> 28:00.400
the mish-mash of time
zones and time changes

28:00.450 --> 28:02.280
is just another example

28:02.320 --> 28:05.620
of the government
overextending its reach.

28:05.660 --> 28:09.580
This bill will be a call
for less government

28:09.620 --> 28:11.830
from our clocks

28:11.870 --> 28:14.920
to our privately built
for-profit prisons

28:14.960 --> 28:18.840
to the very watches
on our wrists.

28:18.880 --> 28:21.210
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
I yield the floor.
