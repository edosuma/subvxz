WEBVTT

00:09.631 --> 00:12.799
Alex, can you give me a hand?
I got one more piece left.

00:13.801 --> 00:14.802
Whoa!

00:17.007 --> 00:20.674
Ooh. You better fix that.

00:20.708 --> 00:23.210
Alex! I just went through a
whole horn of unicorn glue.

00:23.711 --> 00:26.647
Do you know how many hornless unicorns
are running around because of this lamp?

00:26.681 --> 00:28.983
Yes, and now they're called ponies.

00:29.017 --> 00:30.451
You remember what those were,

00:30.652 --> 00:32.586
you were scared of
them until last year.

00:32.619 --> 00:35.657
I don't care what anyone says,
those things are dangerous.

00:35.691 --> 00:38.827
I'll just fix it the way
it should've been fixed

00:38.861 --> 00:40.195
in the first place.

00:40.296 --> 00:41.830
Red Skies at night Fix it right!

00:44.466 --> 00:45.764
Wait...

00:45.798 --> 00:48.134
Alex, your wand just
shorted the system out.

00:50.437 --> 00:52.705
Dad, did you forget to pay
the wizard power bill?

00:52.806 --> 00:56.076
Not this time. I haven't missed
once since we can pay by wand.

00:56.111 --> 00:59.647
The wizard world is
experiencing rolling blackouts.

00:59.682 --> 01:02.751
- We don't have our powers?!
- Just temporarily.

01:02.785 --> 01:05.153
Someone left the door open
at the wizard power plant.

01:05.187 --> 01:06.421
All the dragons got out.

01:06.722 --> 01:08.356
It's gonna be a while
till they get back.

01:09.692 --> 01:12.192
More importantly,
why did you break the lamp?

01:14.396 --> 01:18.965
Look, we could talk about
who broke the lamp,

01:19.000 --> 01:21.168
and spend all our time
on whose fault it was,

01:21.202 --> 01:25.205
or we could just live in the moment,
where Justin fixes it.

01:25.240 --> 01:26.941
Now, I don't know about you,

01:27.075 --> 01:29.444
but I choose to live in
the moment and move on.

01:29.478 --> 01:31.913
- Who's with me?
- Yeah, nobody.

01:33.249 --> 01:35.316
Justin, just fix the
lamp before Mom gets back

01:35.351 --> 01:37.618
- from her spa weekend.
- Da...

01:38.553 --> 01:40.654
Sleep with one eye open tonight.

01:43.725 --> 01:45.325
Ooh, what's that, Daddy?

01:45.360 --> 01:47.961
Spare parts for
Justin's robot wife?

01:49.564 --> 01:51.898
It's a Wizinko machine.
I was going to demonstrate it,

01:51.933 --> 01:53.934
but since powers are down
it's gonna have to wait.

01:53.968 --> 01:55.302
What's it supposed to do?

01:55.437 --> 01:56.937
It turns  two-dimensis

01:56.972 --> 01:58.706
into three-dimensional copies.

01:58.907 --> 02:02.244
Maybe it can take Justin's
two-dimensional personality

02:02.278 --> 02:06.282
- and turn that into something.
- That didn't make any sense.

02:06.317 --> 02:07.984
But were you hurt a little bit?

02:08.085 --> 02:10.888
- A little.
- Yeah, then it made sense.

02:12.491 --> 02:15.427
* Well, you kw everything's
gonna be a breeze *

02:15.461 --> 02:17.530
* That the end will no
doubt justify the means *

02:17.997 --> 02:19.765
* You can fix any problem
with the slightest of ease *

02:19.800 --> 02:21.266
* Yes please *

02:21.434 --> 02:23.233
* But you might find out
it'll go to your head *

02:23.700 --> 02:25.200
* When you write a report
on a book you never read *

02:25.768 --> 02:27.435
* With the snap of your fingers
you can make your bed *

02:27.469 --> 02:28.968
* That's what I said *

02:29.069 --> 02:32.270
* Everything is not what it seems *

02:32.304 --> 02:36.075
* You can get all you wanted
in your wildest dreams *

02:36.109 --> 02:39.945
* You might run into trouble
if you go to extremes *

02:39.979 --> 02:44.250
* Because everything
is not what it seems *

02:44.284 --> 02:47.652
* Evething is not what it seems *

02:47.687 --> 02:51.488
* When you can have what you
want by the simplest of means *

02:51.523 --> 02:55.226
* Be careful t to mess with
the balance of things *

02:55.260 --> 02:59.429
* Because everything is not *

02:59.463 --> 03:01.498
* What it seems *

03:01.499 --> 03:10.499

03:11.306 --> 03:13.641
Dude, what is going on?!

03:13.676 --> 03:15.276
Did the pretty bus
break down outside,

03:15.411 --> 03:17.612
or do I have another
stye in my eye?

03:19.614 --> 03:21.115
No, it's Fashion Week.

03:21.149 --> 03:23.183
There's models all
over New York City.

03:28.455 --> 03:30.855
Hey, maybe we can get a couple
of these girls to play some

03:30.890 --> 03:33.691
Dungeons & Gargoyles with us.

03:35.360 --> 03:37.127
All right, but we're
gonna need a plan.

03:37.495 --> 03:39.563
Something better than following
the girls around for an hour,

03:39.597 --> 03:41.965
and just when we're ready to
speak to them, we wimp out,

03:41.999 --> 03:44.367
make up some lame excuse
like we're tying our shoes,

03:44.401 --> 03:47.036
and th go see a movie we've
already seen four times.

03:47.070 --> 03:50.071
I don't know, bro,
Robert Downey, Jr.

03:50.106 --> 03:51.572
is so good in that mov.

03:51.906 --> 03:53.840
He is so good. - You know
what I'm talking about?

03:55.109 --> 03:57.076
- No, Zeke. We gotta do this.
- All right.

03:57.111 --> 03:58.278
I don't want to end up

03:58.579 --> 04:00.012
the male equivalent
of chicks with cats.

04:00.046 --> 04:01.580
Hey, I have a cat.

04:03.181 --> 04:04.847
We gotta do this now.

04:07.084 --> 04:08.384
Alex?

04:11.688 --> 04:13.956
I just scored the
gig of a lifetime,

04:13.990 --> 04:16.625
working for world-famous designer,
Mr. Frenchy.

04:17.927 --> 04:19.861
Wow. I just ate a bunch of sugar.

04:19.894 --> 04:21.563
I guess we're both
having good days.

04:23.132 --> 04:25.366
Come on, this is a big deal.

04:25.401 --> 04:27.335
I was picked out of
five thousand applicants

04:27.369 --> 04:29.104
to work with him.

04:29.138 --> 04:31.305
If I do a good job,

04:31.340 --> 04:34.108
it could jump-start
my career in design.

04:34.142 --> 04:38.043
Imagine... the whole
world dressed like me.

04:40.346 --> 04:42.346
Yeah, I don't have an
imagination that big.

04:44.049 --> 04:48.053
Mr. Frenchy is known for
his one-of-a-kind designs,

04:48.087 --> 04:50.422
and he's trusted me with
this year's newest creation.

04:50.456 --> 04:52.190
Wait, is he that dude that made

04:52.225 --> 04:54.325
that credit card dress
you showed me st year?

04:54.359 --> 04:56.960
Yeah, and the playing card
dress and the balloon dress...

04:56.994 --> 04:59.228
Actually, the balloon
dress didn't work out,

04:59.263 --> 05:02.430
'cause there was also a dress
made out of porcupine needles.

05:02.464 --> 05:05.699
I remember that dress.

05:05.733 --> 05:09.368
It is so funny when people
you don't know explode.

05:17.478 --> 05:19.078
Mr. Frenchy doesn't want anyone

05:19.246 --> 05:20.880
taking pictures of it be the show,

05:21.214 --> 05:23.248
so he trusted me with it,
because no one would guess

05:23.282 --> 05:24.883
his high school intern had it.

05:25.084 --> 05:27.384
- Wow. Let me see.
- No, no, no, no, no.

05:30.587 --> 05:32.922
No one sees.

05:32.956 --> 05:35.690
I need you to use magic to lock
this up in a magic lock box,

05:35.725 --> 05:37.158
or a magic treasure chest or...

05:37.293 --> 05:38.626
Oh, how about a gic dress vault?

05:38.660 --> 05:39.994
That would be perfect!

05:40.028 --> 05:42.929
Yeah, too bad that doesn't exist.

05:42.963 --> 05:46.798
- Plus, my powers are down.
- That stinks. Well, bye.

05:46.832 --> 05:48.833
Harper...

05:48.868 --> 05:50.235
I can still help you.

05:50.469 --> 05:52.203
u can keep it in my room.
It'll be safe there.

05:52.238 --> 05:55.105
- OK, well, bye.
- Harper?

05:57.341 --> 05:59.442
Do you really want to make
me use a bunch of words

05:59.476 --> 06:02.110
to confuse you into
letting me keep it?

06:02.144 --> 06:03.777
No. Here.

06:03.812 --> 06:06.112
Thank you. You jt saved
us a lot of time.

06:08.000 --> 06:14.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

06:22.962 --> 06:24.897
Are you trying to walk lik?

06:26.299 --> 06:29.636
No. Are you trying to look
like a waiter at Fiesta Grande?

06:30.972 --> 06:33.005
- What's with the tray?
- What's with the dress?

06:33.039 --> 06:35.106
- I asked you first.
- A series of small snacks

06:35.374 --> 06:37.974
is healthier than gorging
yourself at meals. Your turn.

06:38.008 --> 06:41.044
It's an original,
one-of-a-kind Mr. Frenchy

06:41.078 --> 06:43.645
that Harper's trusted me
with until the fashion show.

06:43.680 --> 06:45.781
You think that the best
way to protect the dress

06:45.815 --> 06:47.883
is by prancing around
your room wearing it?

06:48.117 --> 06:51.420
What if someone, like me,
were to come along and go, "Whoa!"

06:51.454 --> 06:54.322
Justin, stop! That's not funny.

06:54.357 --> 06:55.924
Oh, but this is.

07:00.764 --> 07:03.199
You're right. This is funny.

07:03.233 --> 07:05.167
So funny.

07:05.202 --> 07:06.569
But you know what's nnier?

07:06.603 --> 07:08.970
How much I love my sister!

07:09.004 --> 07:12.005
Justin, no! Stop! Let me down.

07:16.043 --> 07:17.644
Turn the music down.

07:36.793 --> 07:39.960
Dude! When are we going
to make our move?

07:39.995 --> 07:41.628
We've been sitting here forever.

07:42.096 --> 07:44.062
We're not just sitting here,
we're coming up with a plan.

07:44.096 --> 07:46.529
I read that supermodels
love guys who are connected.

07:46.563 --> 07:48.530
Oh! I'm totally connected.

07:48.564 --> 07:51.701
I get ten percent off at t.

07:51.735 --> 07:53.135
Why don't we hold on to that one?

07:53.170 --> 07:54.670
Follow my lead.

08:05.382 --> 08:07.850
Hey.

08:07.884 --> 08:09.184
Hi.

08:10.152 --> 08:11.318
So, my dad owns this place.

08:11.586 --> 08:13.619
- Just sayin'.
- He says stuff.

08:13.654 --> 08:16.922
Wod you like a free refill
on one of those beverages?

08:16.956 --> 08:19.691
- Gratis.
- Sure.

08:19.725 --> 08:23.192
You guys are kinda weird.
I like it.

08:25.060 --> 08:27.527
Well, I get ten percent
off at the Puzzle Zoo.

08:27.561 --> 08:28.895
I love the Puze Zoo.

08:36.001 --> 08:40.739
- My dad owns this place.
- You already said that.

08:40.774 --> 08:44.241
I get ten percent off
at the Puzzle Zoo.

08:44.275 --> 08:48.010
- You already said that.
- Can you give us a moment?

08:48.045 --> 08:49.211
[chuckle

08:50.380 --> 08:53.282
It's goi great!

08:53.316 --> 08:55.251
No. We need something
more to talk about.

08:55.285 --> 08:57.819
All right, well, I mean...

08:57.854 --> 08:59.654
One more punch and I
get a free smoothie.

08:59.689 --> 09:01.022
Perfect.

09:03.293 --> 09:06.194
Where'd they go? To the bathroom?

09:06.229 --> 09:07.863
Yeah. Sure.

09:07.897 --> 09:09.664
Why don't u stay here
and wait for 'em.

09:09.698 --> 09:11.365
OK.

09:23.310 --> 09:26.478
Justin lied. There's no
story about me in here.

09:27.547 --> 09:29.414
Hey, Alex.

09:29.448 --> 09:32.650
Hey, Harper...

09:32.684 --> 09:35.152
I want the bad news first.

09:35.186 --> 09:37.220
How did you know what
I was ing to say?

09:37.254 --> 09:39.188
I figured out your "good news,
bad news" smile

09:39.222 --> 09:40.656
a week after I met you.

09:42.525 --> 09:45.861
OK, so I need to figure out a way

09:45.895 --> 09:48.530
to make "I ruined the
dress" sound not so bad.

09:48.564 --> 09:49.964
You ruined the dress?!

09:49.998 --> 09:51.432
After you made me give it to you?

09:51.833 --> 09:53.300
I got the opportunity
of a lifetime here,

09:53.334 --> 09:54.967
and it's about to
blow up in my face.

09:55.302 --> 09:58.371
Look, we could talk about
who ruined t dress...

09:58.405 --> 09:59.872
You did.

09:59.906 --> 10:03.442
Or, we couldive in the moment.

10:03.477 --> 10:05.710
Now, I choose to live
in the mome and move on.

10:05.744 --> 10:08.345
- Are you with me?
- Only because I have to be,

10:08.379 --> 10:10.313
because you're the one
who got us in trble.

10:10.347 --> 10:12.848
Great, we're moving on. It's good.

10:16.118 --> 10:18.218
Finkle. Whers my schmata?

10:18.253 --> 10:20.653
Mr. Frenchy, I need
to tell you something.

10:20.687 --> 10:23.021
Your tone implies it
won't be pleasant.

10:23.056 --> 10:25.691
And Frenchy's ino mood to
hear anything unpleasant.

10:25.725 --> 10:28.060
I just snt an hour
looking for my Bluetooth.

10:28.094 --> 10:30.695
It was in my ear the whole time.

10:32.164 --> 10:34.098
OK, then.

10:34.133 --> 10:36.201
Tell him something pleasant, Alex.

10:37.770 --> 10:40.305
We have black and
white cookies today.

10:40.339 --> 10:44.908
I was hoping to hear something about
my newest one-of-a-kind dress.

10:44.942 --> 10:47.677
I hope it's in a
temperature-controlled room.

10:49.413 --> 10:52.614
The thing about your dress is...

10:52.648 --> 10:55.716
Is... That it's totally fine.

10:55.750 --> 10:57.351
She's doing such a great job.

10:57.385 --> 10:58.918
You picked the right girl for this.

10:58.953 --> 11:02.888
I guess I did, whoever you are.

11:02.922 --> 11:04.656
I knew I could count
on you, Finkle.

11:04.757 --> 11:06.557
Oh, excuse me.

11:06.658 --> 11:09.260
I'm receiving communications.
Go for Frenchy.

11:10.695 --> 11:12.162
Al, oh, my gosh. This is great.

11:12.464 --> 11:14.364
You have a plan for what
to do about the dress?

11:14.398 --> 11:18.900
Yeah. Like I said, my plan is
"moving on" from the dress.

11:18.935 --> 11:21.269
Moving on? You really
think that's gonna work?

11:21.304 --> 11:22.971
Finkle, we're in trouble.

11:23.105 --> 11:26.740
He's on to us.
I knew this wasn't gonna work.

11:26.774 --> 11:29.641
They double booked the
location for my fashion show.

11:29.676 --> 11:31.376
My show is... is...

11:31.410 --> 11:34.478
In situations like this,
I usually say, "hosed."

11:34.512 --> 11:37.780
...hosed!

11:37.815 --> 11:44.290
Mr. Frenchy, why don't you
have the fashion show here?

11:44.324 --> 11:47.328
Here? I don't even know
what this place is.

11:47.363 --> 11:50.430
Is it a subway station
or a sandwich shop?

11:50.465 --> 11:53.432
It's one-of-a-kind, just like you.

11:53.467 --> 11:57.835
Who else would have an amazing
high-fashion fashion show

11:57.870 --> 11:59.603
at a sandwich shop?

11:59.638 --> 12:01.772
Or we could have it at my house.

12:01.806 --> 12:04.174
My mom just put plastic slip
covers in the living room,

12:04.208 --> 12:05.308
so we're allowed in now.

12:05.342 --> 12:07.042
But no shoes.

12:07.076 --> 12:10.947
Oh, that's great. Let's have
it at the sandwich shop.

12:10.981 --> 12:13.449
- Problem solved.
- Excellent.

12:13.483 --> 12:15.985
One more good idea and I might
bother to learn your name.

12:16.019 --> 12:17.185
It's Alex.

12:17.387 --> 12:20.890
I'd prefer something like Daphne.
Chew on it.

12:23.796 --> 12:27.131
Great, you solved that problem.
But what about the dress?

12:28.800 --> 12:31.434
I know. I know.

12:31.469 --> 12:33.669
- Moving on.
- Thank you.

12:33.703 --> 12:35.504
When this place is
crawling with models

12:35.539 --> 12:37.173
and his fashion show is going great

12:37.474 --> 12:39.675
he'll have forgotten all
about his little dress.

12:39.710 --> 12:41.777
You're telling me he's
going to forget all about

12:42.145 --> 12:44.379
his one-of-a-kind dress that he
trusted me to ard with my life

12:44.413 --> 12:46.046
just 'cause there's
a show going on?

12:46.981 --> 12:50.783
Wow. Someone's not moving on.

13:02.104 --> 13:04.540
Let's go, people.
We've only got two hours.

13:04.575 --> 13:08.844
And no one's even sweating.
Except this guy.

13:08.879 --> 13:13.280
Hi. I'm the owner. Look,
this place has never been busier.

13:13.315 --> 13:15.682
I just want to thank you
for choosing my restaurant

13:15.716 --> 13:16.816
for your fashion show.

13:17.017 --> 13:19.318
Oh, so this is a sandwich shop?

13:19.352 --> 13:22.486
I just ignored the big subway
car standing back there.

13:22.520 --> 13:24.054
Oh, sandwiches.

13:24.088 --> 13:26.322
No, don't eat these. They're bad.

13:26.357 --> 13:28.224
I made these a couple of days ago.

13:28.258 --> 13:30.525
Then I lost them,
but then I found them.

13:32.128 --> 13:34.262
Excuse me while I pretend
to take a phone call.

13:34.296 --> 13:35.796
Go for Frenchy.

13:36.698 --> 13:38.665
Oh, Alex, honey, do me a favor.

13:38.699 --> 13:40.933
Get rid of these sandwiches.
They're no good.

13:40.968 --> 13:42.601
I'm all about helping.

13:44.738 --> 13:46.472
Oh, my gosh.
This might actually work.

13:46.506 --> 13:48.173
He hasn't asked me about the dress.

13:48.208 --> 13:50.175
See, that's the
beauty of moving on.

13:50.210 --> 13:51.810
I've got to get rid
of these sandwiches.

13:51.945 --> 13:52.811
My dad said they weren't good.

13:53.479 --> 13:55.781
Or they can get rid of them for me.

13:55.815 --> 13:57.649
All right, less work for me. Good.

14:01.119 --> 14:04.555
I wish we lived in a world where you could
just walk up to a model and be like,

14:04.589 --> 14:07.625
"What's up? You want to play
Dungeons & Gargoyles with us?"

14:07.660 --> 14:09.527
Sure, that sounds like fun.

14:11.063 --> 14:12.063
Can my friends come?

14:13.565 --> 14:16.167
You don't play
Dungeons & Gargoyles.

14:16.201 --> 14:18.969
Oh, just because I'm beautiful,
means I can't be smart?

14:19.004 --> 14:20.837
Or an eleventh level cleric?

14:20.872 --> 14:23.239
- Hot.
- Hot.

14:23.273 --> 14:25.674
When you guys are finished
with your sandwiches,

14:25.709 --> 14:27.943
we'll go upstairs and play.

14:30.614 --> 14:33.316
- Did that just happen?
- I am not sure.

14:33.350 --> 14:35.684
I'm gonna put some
cologne on just in case.

14:35.718 --> 14:37.953
Cologne.

14:37.987 --> 14:40.421
My shower soap has
scent built right in.

14:43.290 --> 14:45.122
- Three!
- Uh-oh!

14:46.724 --> 14:48.191
I love this game.

14:48.292 --> 14:50.159
So you're in the cavern
and you can either use

14:50.527 --> 14:52.861
- your plus three sword or...
- My magic missile spell.

14:52.895 --> 14:55.996
Nicely played. I forgot
you had a bag of weapons.

14:58.099 --> 14:59.299
Can I just say,

14:59.567 --> 15:02.036
we're playing Dungeons &
Gargoyles with models?

15:02.070 --> 15:04.638
You've said that
every five minutes.

15:06.474 --> 15:08.774
I'm gonna keep saying it until
it's proven not to be true.

15:08.808 --> 15:09.808
Yeah!

15:09.843 --> 15:12.611
Oh! There they are.

15:12.645 --> 15:15.079
Guys, we need the girls
downstairs to get ready.

15:15.114 --> 15:17.315
No, Alex. Not till we're done.

15:20.119 --> 15:22.954
That's a pretty awesome
gargoyle noise.

15:22.989 --> 15:26.223
That's not a gargoyle noise,
that's my tummy.

15:26.257 --> 15:28.657
I don't think I'm feeling too well.

15:28.691 --> 15:31.424
- Where's the bathroom?
- Through that door.

15:39.601 --> 15:43.505
Uh-oh! Hearing people getting
sick makes me get sick.

15:44.973 --> 15:46.640
What's wrong with them?
! Why are thy sick?!

15:46.675 --> 15:47.908
I don't know.

15:48.042 --> 15:50.110
- Did they eat something bad?
- No.

15:50.378 --> 15:53.279
All they ate were these sandwiches
that Dad said didn't taste good.

15:55.080 --> 15:58.047
Did he say they didn't taste
good or they were no good?

15:58.082 --> 16:01.584
What's the difference?

16:03.319 --> 16:05.554
Way to go. You ruined my
one shot with these girls.

16:05.588 --> 16:08.422
I'm coming ladies. I got hair ties.

16:09.858 --> 16:11.725
How are we supposed
to have a fashion show

16:11.760 --> 16:13.460
to distract Mr.
Frenchy from the fact

16:13.895 --> 16:15.863
that we ruined his dress,
when all the models are sick?

16:15.897 --> 16:17.397
Hmm.

16:17.432 --> 16:19.999
Somehow we've moved on all the
way back around to the dress.

16:25.738 --> 16:28.306
I think I have an idea.
Magic's back.

16:28.341 --> 16:29.607
Since we don't have a lot of time,

16:30.309 --> 16:31.510
we're gonna skip the part
where I do magic badly,

16:31.544 --> 16:32.644
and just make it all work out.

16:33.113 --> 16:35.746
- We can skip that part?
- We'll see.

16:39.184 --> 16:41.552
I just need to get one thing
from Justin's room to help us.

16:41.586 --> 16:43.920
Why are we in your room to
get stuff from Justin's room?

16:44.021 --> 16:46.657
Because we're getting stuff from
the box under my bed that says,

16:46.692 --> 16:48.660
"Justin's Favorite
Things from His Room."

16:51.364 --> 16:54.299
I steal this stuff to make up
for the times he's annoyed me.

16:54.333 --> 16:57.569
Hey, a Captain Jim Bob
Sherwood lunch box.

16:57.603 --> 16:59.237
I took that one because the actual

16:59.338 --> 17:00.804
Captain Jim Bob Sherwood just died,

17:01.306 --> 17:02.572
and the price for that thing
went through the roof.

17:05.441 --> 17:08.710
One poster of supermodel Bibi Rockford,
and we're good to go.

17:08.743 --> 17:11.380
But how... I'm tired of fighting.

17:11.414 --> 17:13.248
Let's just do it, whatever it is.

17:17.053 --> 17:20.388
We're gonna make a magical
copy of Bibi Rockford.

17:35.100 --> 17:39.536
Wow. She's even prettier in person.

17:39.570 --> 17:41.571
Thanks for taking me off
your brother's wall.

17:41.605 --> 17:43.172
He was always staring at me.

17:46.842 --> 17:50.043
Why am I still holding this?

17:50.077 --> 17:51.411
This is so great.

17:51.512 --> 17:53.079
The only thing that'd
make it better is if

17:53.313 --> 17:55.047
we had the newspaper
dress for Mr. Frenchy.

17:55.081 --> 17:56.815
One step ahead of you.

17:56.849 --> 17:59.684
Lucky for you I took a picture
of myself in the dress.

18:11.227 --> 18:12.927
Goodness, I do look
good in that dress.

18:13.095 --> 18:15.528
Bibi Rockford, come on,
put that dress on.

18:15.563 --> 18:16.996
We've got a fashion show to save.

18:17.030 --> 18:19.698
No. I like this dress.

18:19.733 --> 18:22.501
Alex, can I talk to you
over there for a second?

18:23.770 --> 18:25.037
Sure.

18:32.476 --> 18:35.478
We brushed elbows when we were
getting sick at the same bowl.

18:35.512 --> 18:38.580
It was hot and gross
at the same time.

18:40.416 --> 18:43.655
Excuse me. Can someone
direct me to Hair and Makeup?

18:43.689 --> 18:46.458
Oh, my gosh. Bibi Rockford.

18:46.492 --> 18:48.126
Oh, it's you.

18:49.395 --> 18:51.529
- Don't stare at me.
- Sorry.

18:53.298 --> 18:55.532
Dungeons & Gargoyles?
I love this game. Can I play?

18:55.566 --> 18:58.901
Do all models play
Dungeons & Gargoyles?

18:58.936 --> 19:01.803
No, but all supermodels do.

19:03.273 --> 19:06.375
It's a great stress reliever from being,
I don't know, super.

19:08.111 --> 19:10.811
- Where did you come from?
- From Justin's room.

19:10.846 --> 19:14.781
All right, Justin!

19:14.815 --> 19:17.716
My room... Sweet!

19:17.750 --> 19:19.451
Alex!

19:19.485 --> 19:22.120
Are we going to talk about
playing Dungeons & Gargoyles,

19:22.154 --> 19:26.859
or are we going to go on this quest
for the Gold Dragon's treasure?

19:28.461 --> 19:30.663
I'd be OK if the world
ended right now.

19:31.965 --> 19:34.565
Well, you better be
'cause it might, OK?

19:37.502 --> 19:40.337
Wow, you really convinced
yourself to get that dress off.

19:40.371 --> 19:43.373
I have this pressure point in my
shoulder that only I know about.

19:44.908 --> 19:47.676
Come on, Bibi Rockford.
We've got a fashion show to save.

19:47.710 --> 19:49.878
I'm tired of modeling.

19:49.912 --> 19:54.682
All that walking up and down,
up and down. It's boring.

19:56.418 --> 19:58.786
I'd rather play
Dungeons & Gargoyles.

20:02.423 --> 20:05.692
Wait a minute, Bibi Rockford
is playing your game.

20:05.726 --> 20:08.460
You used magic to
turn her into a geek.

20:08.494 --> 20:10.629
You used magic to bring
my poster to life.

20:10.663 --> 20:12.763
Fine. I used magic.

20:12.898 --> 20:16.000
Tell her the game is over, she has to
go downstairs to save the fashion show.

20:16.034 --> 20:18.603
I guess I could, but aren't
you the one always saying

20:18.637 --> 20:21.305
that when things go bad,
you should just move on?

20:21.339 --> 20:23.407
Pull up a chair,
play some Dungeons & Gargoyles

20:23.441 --> 20:25.174
and have a big bowl of "moving on."

20:25.376 --> 20:28.310
- Is that what I sound like?
- Yes! Oh, sorry.

20:28.344 --> 20:29.911
That question was for you, Justin.

20:31.280 --> 20:32.681
Yes.

20:32.715 --> 20:34.949
If I say I'm sorry for stealing
your stuff, you'll help?

20:34.984 --> 20:36.584
- Yes.
- That "sorry" didn't count?

20:36.785 --> 20:38.218
- Nope.
- Fine. I'm sorry. We done?

20:38.586 --> 20:40.220
I want my Captain Jim Bob
Sherwood lunch box back.

20:40.254 --> 20:41.553
- Fine.
- Thanks. I'm on it.

20:43.823 --> 20:47.192
Sorry, Zeke, your cloak
of invisibility ripped,

20:47.227 --> 20:50.227
- you've been exposed.
- Oh, my gosh, I'm blushing.

20:51.896 --> 20:54.764
- Game's over, people.
- What? No way, Jose. No.

20:54.798 --> 20:57.232
Yes way. I'm behind and
I'm a sore loser. See?

20:57.267 --> 20:58.567
No!

20:58.601 --> 21:02.972
You fool! What have you done? No!

21:04.041 --> 21:05.774
I did what I had to do, Zeke.

21:05.808 --> 21:09.143
OK... Come on,
Bibi Rockford, let's go.

21:09.178 --> 21:11.513
Leave my brother and his
weird friend to themselves.

21:13.215 --> 21:16.383
Fine, but if I'm gonna walk
the runway, so are you.

21:16.418 --> 21:19.152
No, that's not gonna happen. No.

21:19.187 --> 21:22.056
Right, my friend is not
gonna give up her dignity

21:22.090 --> 21:24.125
for the sake of my fashion career.

21:24.159 --> 21:26.161
She'd rather just move
on and live in the...

21:26.195 --> 21:28.897
- Fine. We'll do it.
- Thanks! You're the best!
