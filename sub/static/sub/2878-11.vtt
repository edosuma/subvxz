00:01.419 --> 00:03.118
(knocking)

00:03.143 --> 00:06.154
Hi. Did Sheldon change
the Wi-Fi password again?

00:06.705 --> 00:08.915
Yeah, it's
"Penny already eats our food.

00:08.916 --> 00:11.517
She can pay for Wi-Fi."

00:12.271 --> 00:13.638
No spaces.

00:13.640 --> 00:14.939
Okay.

00:14.941 --> 00:16.741
If you can't get me
to stop eating your food,

00:16.743 --> 00:18.776
what makes you think you can
get me to stop using your Wi-Fi?

00:18.778 --> 00:21.112
I believe that you're capable
of great change.

00:21.114 --> 00:25.516
Like when I finally got you
to stop saying "Valentimes Day""

00:26.619 --> 00:27.759
You want to hear
something weird?

00:27.784 --> 00:28.587
Sure.

00:28.588 --> 00:30.321
In the year 2000,

00:30.323 --> 00:35.627
Pope John Paul II was named
an honorary Harlem Globetrotter.

00:37.429 --> 00:39.831
What are you talking about?

00:39.833 --> 00:42.967
You asked Penny if she wanted
to hear something weird.

00:42.969 --> 00:45.570
Yeah, because I have
something weird to tell her.

00:45.572 --> 00:47.005
Oh.

00:47.007 --> 00:49.240
I thought it was a game.

00:50.075 --> 00:51.843
What's yours?

00:51.845 --> 00:53.978
There's this guy,
Jimmy Speckerman,

00:53.980 --> 00:56.214
who used to torment me
in high school.

00:56.216 --> 00:58.182
He sent me a message
through Facebook.

00:58.184 --> 01:00.551
He's in town
and wants to have drinks.

01:00.553 --> 01:03.621
Okay, Penny, if it were a game,
here are your choices.

01:03.623 --> 01:05.322
An e-mail
from an old acquaintance,

01:05.325 --> 01:08.226
or the head of one of the
largest religious institutions

01:08.228 --> 01:11.996
in the world slam dunking
to "Sweet Georgia Brown." Pick.

01:14.867 --> 01:18.102
Just do it,
'cause he's not gonna let it go.

01:18.104 --> 01:19.370
Basketball Pope.

01:19.372 --> 01:21.439
And that's how it's done.

01:22.975 --> 01:24.809
What are you gonna do
about your bully?

01:24.811 --> 01:26.744
- Are you gonna see him?
- I don't know.

01:26.746 --> 01:30.114
Is this the fellow who peed
in your Hawaiian Punch?

01:30.116 --> 01:32.550
No, that was a different guy.

01:32.552 --> 01:34.986
Was he the one
who wedgied you so hard,

01:34.988 --> 01:36.254
your testicle reascended,

01:36.256 --> 01:38.022
and you spent
your whole Christmas break

01:38.024 --> 01:40.558
waiting for it
to come back down?

01:42.594 --> 01:45.830
No, that was
a different, different guy.

01:45.832 --> 01:49.834
Was he the one who used
your head to open a nut?

01:49.836 --> 01:51.903
No.

01:51.905 --> 01:53.604
Oh, oh, oh.

01:53.606 --> 01:56.774
Was he the one
who made you eat your arm hair?

01:57.843 --> 01:59.110
No, but, actually,

01:59.112 --> 02:00.912
that was this guy's sister.

02:00.914 --> 02:02.880
All right, well,
what do you think he wants?

02:02.882 --> 02:04.115
I don't know.

02:04.117 --> 02:06.184
You know, the holidays
are just around the corner.

02:06.186 --> 02:07.318
Maybe he wants to see

02:07.320 --> 02:09.187
if he can lodge
the other testicle up there.

02:09.189 --> 02:12.290
I told you.
That was a different guy.

02:12.292 --> 02:14.359
Hmm. That's too bad.
We could have spent

02:14.361 --> 02:17.195

for the ball to drop.

It's 2:00 a.m.
What are you doing up?

02:52.209 --> 02:57.212
Nobel Prize acceptance ceremony
streaming live from Stockholm.

02:57.214 --> 02:58.714
Sure. You want to see

02:58.716 --> 03:01.583
what all the scientists
are wearing this year.

03:01.585 --> 03:03.485
Look at these men.

03:03.487 --> 03:06.755
They've managed to win the top
science prize in the world

03:06.757 --> 03:09.591
with no more understanding
of the quantum underpinnings

03:09.593 --> 03:11.693
of the expansion
of the early universe

03:11.695 --> 03:13.762
than God gave a goose.

03:15.465 --> 03:16.598
You should pay attention,
Leonard.

03:16.600 --> 03:18.433
Someday this could be you
up there.

03:19.302 --> 03:20.836
Thanks.

03:20.838 --> 03:22.137
So,

03:22.139 --> 03:23.639
what's got you up?

03:23.641 --> 03:26.074
Did you have a bad clam?

03:26.076 --> 03:27.743
I didn't have clams.

03:27.745 --> 03:29.678
I don't watch you
24 hours a day.

03:29.680 --> 03:31.780
I don't know what you do.

03:31.782 --> 03:34.850
It's this Jimmy Speckerman
thing.

03:34.852 --> 03:37.819
I can't decide if I should
agree to see him or not.

03:37.821 --> 03:39.087
Of course that might be

03:39.089 --> 03:41.056
because the last time
I ran into him,

03:41.058 --> 03:43.725
he made me floss
with my own shoelaces.

03:43.727 --> 03:46.161
Wear loafers.

03:46.163 --> 03:49.698
Look at Dr. Saul
Perlmutter up there,

03:49.700 --> 03:51.900
clutching that Nobel Prize.

03:51.902 --> 03:53.135
What's the matter, Saul?

03:53.137 --> 03:54.770
You afraid someone's
going to steal it?

03:54.772 --> 03:57.339
Like you stole Einstein's
cosmological constant?

03:57.341 --> 03:59.541
You know what?

03:59.543 --> 04:02.344
I am tired of living
in fear of this guy.

04:02.346 --> 04:04.379
I'm gonna go see
him and finally say

04:04.381 --> 04:07.349
all the things I should
have said in high school.

04:07.351 --> 04:09.051
You know, "Pick on
someone your own size""

04:09.053 --> 04:12.888
"You did not have sex
with my mother."

04:12.890 --> 04:16.858
And "Yes, I do know why
I'm hitting myself."

04:16.860 --> 04:19.361
Oh, now Perlmutter's
shaking the king's hand.

04:19.363 --> 04:21.063
Yeah, check for your watch,
Gustaf.

04:21.065 --> 04:22.831
He might have lifted it.

04:24.867 --> 04:27.069
I love this dress.

04:27.071 --> 04:28.904
How come I never
see you wear it?

04:28.906 --> 04:31.073
'Cause when I wear it,
it's a shirt.

04:32.175 --> 04:34.977
So, what's Howard
doing tonight?

04:34.979 --> 04:38.080
Oh, they all went with Leonard
to confront his childhood bully.

04:38.082 --> 04:39.348
Oh, terrific.

04:39.350 --> 04:43.285
High school quarterback
against four mathletes.

04:43.287 --> 04:44.386
When Leonard gets back,

04:44.388 --> 04:45.921
I'd love to check
his serotonin levels.

04:45.923 --> 04:48.790
Do you think he'd let me draw
a syringe full of his blood?

04:48.792 --> 04:50.559
Hmm, he's not crazy
about needles,

04:50.561 --> 04:52.594
but if you get him to go
jogging,

04:52.596 --> 04:54.396
it'll just pour out of his nose.

04:55.365 --> 04:56.565
I don't think

04:56.567 --> 04:59.201
I can meet the girl
who was always mean to me.

04:59.203 --> 05:00.702
Tammy Bodnick.

05:00.704 --> 05:02.638
One time
while I was in gym class,

05:02.640 --> 05:03.739
she stole all my clothes

05:03.741 --> 05:06.575
and left an elf costume
in my locker.

05:06.577 --> 05:08.477
Oh, that's awful.

05:08.479 --> 05:11.680
Worst part was, it was too big.

05:12.949 --> 05:14.249
That's nothing.

05:14.251 --> 05:17.552
In ninth grade, the girls put
Rogaine in my hand lotion.

05:18.521 --> 05:20.789
Within six months, the
nicknames began to fly.

05:20.791 --> 05:24.293
I think the one that hurt the
most was Gorilla Fingers Fowler.

05:24.295 --> 05:26.161
(sighs)

05:26.163 --> 05:28.563
Wow. You poor thing.

05:28.565 --> 05:30.565
What about you?
Oh.

05:30.567 --> 05:32.701
I don't know. I guess
my school was a nice place.

05:32.703 --> 05:33.869
We didn't really have bullies.

05:33.871 --> 05:36.705
Come on, no one ever
gave anyone mean nicknames

05:36.707 --> 05:39.341
or picked on them or put gum
in their hairy knuckles

05:39.343 --> 05:43.011
so the school nurse had to use
peanut butter to get it out?

05:43.013 --> 05:44.346
No, we weren't really like that.

05:44.348 --> 05:46.515
I mean, look, we played pranks
on each other,

05:46.517 --> 05:47.616
but it was never mean.

05:47.618 --> 05:49.117
Like, okay,
this one girl, Kathy Geiger,

05:49.119 --> 05:50.652
got really good grades,
so we blindfolded her,

05:50.654 --> 05:52.888
tied her up and left her
in a cornfield overnight.

05:55.391 --> 05:57.359
Oh, my God,
that's awful.

05:57.361 --> 05:59.928
No, it was funny.
Everyone laughed.

05:59.930 --> 06:02.230
Did Kathy
Geiger laugh?

06:02.232 --> 06:03.999
Uh, probably.
It's hard to say.

06:04.001 --> 06:06.935
She kind of had an ear
of corn in her mouth.

06:06.937 --> 06:09.171
Who would have thought

06:09.173 --> 06:13.141
Fuzzy Fingers Fowler
is best friends with a bully?

06:13.143 --> 06:15.811
What? I was not a bully.

06:15.813 --> 06:17.412
Kind of sounds like you were.

06:17.414 --> 06:19.848
And maybe a felon.

06:22.485 --> 06:24.853
Shh. That's how you
wind up in a cornfield.

06:29.959 --> 06:31.727
Is that him over there?

06:31.729 --> 06:33.161
No.

06:33.163 --> 06:35.130
How about that guy?

06:35.132 --> 06:37.466
He looks like he'd hate you.

06:37.468 --> 06:39.835
You know, I can really do this
by myself.

06:39.837 --> 06:41.470
Hey, we're here
to support you, buddy.

06:41.472 --> 06:43.071
No, you're not.
You're here to see

06:43.073 --> 06:45.140
if I get my underwear
pulled over my head.

06:45.142 --> 06:47.843
(laughing):
You wore underwear? You fool.

06:49.278 --> 06:51.413
So, have you figured out what
you're going to say to him?

06:51.415 --> 06:54.015
You bet. I am going to
make him apologize

06:54.017 --> 06:56.885
for all the crap
he pulled on me in school.

06:56.887 --> 06:58.787
That's quite a list.

06:58.789 --> 07:00.188
I can't read your handwriting.

07:00.190 --> 07:01.356
What's that word?

07:01.358 --> 07:02.824
"Scrotum."

07:02.826 --> 07:05.694
What's that one?

07:05.696 --> 07:07.963
Uh, "stapled."

07:09.365 --> 07:12.801
Leonard.

07:12.803 --> 07:15.470
(laughing)
Oh, hi.

07:15.472 --> 07:17.873
Holy crap, man,
it's good to see you.

07:17.875 --> 07:20.509
Yeah. You, too.
Uh, Jimmy, this is

07:20.511 --> 07:21.877
Sheldon and Raj and Howard.

07:21.879 --> 07:24.513
Hi. Fellas... Hey,
can I get a beer?

07:24.515 --> 07:26.348
Wow. Look at you.

07:26.350 --> 07:27.849
Little Leonard Hofstadter.

07:27.851 --> 07:29.718
I hear
you're a big-time scientist now.

07:29.720 --> 07:32.154
And there's the first
zinger. Ouch.

07:32.156 --> 07:34.823
I'm doing okay, I guess.

07:34.825 --> 07:37.025
Okay? Come on, I read online

07:37.027 --> 07:38.727
you're a physicist
at a university,

07:38.729 --> 07:39.861
you won some medal.

07:39.863 --> 07:41.563
The Newcomb medal.

07:41.565 --> 07:42.898
Yeah, congratulations.

07:42.900 --> 07:44.366
Congratulations?

07:44.368 --> 07:46.301
The Newcomb medal?
Oh, please.

07:46.303 --> 07:47.702
That's the scientific equivalent

07:47.704 --> 07:50.138
of a smiley face sticker
on your homework.

07:50.140 --> 07:52.641
From what I read,
it sounded like a big deal.

07:52.643 --> 07:55.043
Oh, good Lord,
are we going to stand here

07:55.045 --> 07:57.212
and listen to him
tear Leonard apart like this?

07:58.247 --> 08:00.148
Hey, I won a Newcomb medal, too.

08:00.150 --> 08:01.550
My point.

08:02.785 --> 08:04.619
You should have seen this guy
back in the day.

08:04.621 --> 08:07.522
Huh? He was so little, he could
fit in just about anywhere.

08:07.524 --> 08:09.624
Lockers, trash cans.

08:09.626 --> 08:12.828
Oh, man, how did you get
inside that backpack?

08:14.163 --> 08:15.964
Oh, I can't take all the credit.

08:15.966 --> 08:18.266
You helped a lot.
Yeah.

08:18.268 --> 08:20.168
We were practically
a comedy team.

08:20.170 --> 08:23.839
Like the Black Death
and Europe.

08:23.841 --> 08:27.709
Jimmy, I'm kind of curious why
you wanted to see me.

08:27.711 --> 08:29.578
Okay, here it is.

08:29.580 --> 08:31.046
I have this great
money-making idea.

08:31.048 --> 08:33.181
I just need a gear head
to get it to the finish line.

08:33.183 --> 08:34.850
Technically, Howard's the
gear head.

08:34.852 --> 08:37.885
Leonard's just a dime store
laser jockey.

08:37.888 --> 08:39.354
What's the idea?

08:39.356 --> 08:41.089
This is just between us, right?

08:41.091 --> 08:42.357
- Right.
- Okay.

08:42.359 --> 08:44.326
What do you think
about a pair of glasses

08:44.328 --> 08:46.761
that makes any movie
you want into 3D?

08:46.763 --> 08:48.129
That sounds amazing.

08:48.131 --> 08:52.100
First movie I'm
watching-- <i>Annie.</i>

08:53.236 --> 08:56.171
How exactly would
these glasses work?

08:56.173 --> 08:59.207
How the hell should I know?
That's why I need a nerd.

08:59.209 --> 09:03.044
I don't think something like
that's even possible.

09:03.046 --> 09:04.679
Aw, come on, you can
figure it out.

09:04.681 --> 09:06.381
You're like the smartest
guy I've ever known.

09:06.383 --> 09:07.616
The smartest...?!

09:07.618 --> 09:10.452
All right, you know,
I may not have

09:10.454 --> 09:14.589
a firm grasp on sarcasm, but
even I know that was a doozy.

09:15.825 --> 09:18.426
Leonard, you can't live in
fear of this man forever.

09:18.428 --> 09:19.995
Sheldon, I got this.

09:19.997 --> 09:21.530
You clearly don't.

09:21.532 --> 09:23.899
What my spineless friend
lacks the courage to say

09:23.901 --> 09:25.967
is you're a
terrible person

09:25.969 --> 09:27.235
who took advantage

09:27.237 --> 09:30.438
of his tiny size,
his uncoordinated nature

09:30.440 --> 09:32.541
and his congenital
lack of masculinity.

09:32.543 --> 09:33.575
Sheldon...

09:33.577 --> 09:35.410
Leonard, I platonically
love you, man,

09:35.412 --> 09:36.845
but face it, you're a mess.

09:38.781 --> 09:41.483
I don't understand.

09:41.485 --> 09:45.487
I think what he's trying to say
is that maybe in high school

09:45.489 --> 09:47.055
you picked on me a little bit.

09:47.057 --> 09:48.890
A little bit?

09:48.892 --> 09:51.993
The man Super Glued Hershey's
Kisses to your nipples.

09:54.230 --> 09:56.431
That's funny because those
aren't the kind of kisses

09:56.433 --> 09:57.933
you want on your nipples.

09:59.368 --> 10:00.635
What is that?

10:00.637 --> 10:03.738
This is a list of your heinous
acts against Leonard.

10:03.740 --> 10:06.308
One of which is certainly the
cause of him wetting his bed

10:06.310 --> 10:07.742
well into his teens.

10:08.778 --> 10:12.314
14 is not... Aw, never mind.

10:14.016 --> 10:16.518
What's this word?

10:16.520 --> 10:18.186
"Nancy."

10:19.021 --> 10:23.024
You called me Nancy
for three years.

10:24.093 --> 10:27.362
You really need to work
on your penmanship.

10:27.364 --> 10:30.465
Oh, man, I...

10:30.467 --> 10:32.834
I don't know what to say.

10:32.836 --> 10:34.970
I always thought we were
just having some fun.

10:34.972 --> 10:36.972
It wasn't fun for me.

10:37.873 --> 10:39.341
You're being too kind, Leonard.

10:39.343 --> 10:41.476
You ruined him.

10:42.411 --> 10:43.778
Come on, guys.

10:43.780 --> 10:45.981
That was pretty badass, dude.

10:45.983 --> 10:47.716
I help the weak.

10:47.718 --> 10:49.751
It's yet another way I'm
exactly like Batman.

10:49.753 --> 10:54.189
Hey, for the record, Jimmy
wasn't the reason I wet the bed.

10:54.191 --> 10:57.659
That one has my mother
written all over it.

11:02.174 --> 11:03.574
<i>Anyway, I'm really sorry</i>

11:03.576 --> 11:05.810
I made fun of your
stutter in high school.

11:05.812 --> 11:07.878
You're doing great.

11:07.880 --> 11:09.247
Uh-huh.

11:10.115 --> 11:11.415
Uh-huh.

11:11.417 --> 11:14.452
Oh, God, just
finish the sentence.

11:18.223 --> 11:21.726
Okay, well, I'm sorry
you feel that way. Bye.

11:21.728 --> 11:24.462
No one wants to hear
my apologies.

11:24.464 --> 11:26.464
I think your mistake is doing it
over the phone.

11:26.466 --> 11:29.133
If they could look
into your eyes, they'd melt.

11:31.169 --> 11:33.271
Penny, it doesn't matter
what you did in the past.

11:33.273 --> 11:34.939
You're a good person now.

11:34.941 --> 11:36.440
That's easy for you to say.

11:36.442 --> 11:39.577
You weren't just called
a "b-b-b-b-bitch."

11:39.579 --> 11:44.382
Perhaps you could assuage
your guilt through altruism.

11:46.885 --> 11:49.654
Which word's tripping you up?

11:49.656 --> 11:52.256
"Assuage," or "altruism"?

11:52.258 --> 11:54.992
Both.

11:56.228 --> 11:58.963
You'll feel better by doing
something nice for someone.

11:58.965 --> 12:01.565
- I actually knew that.
- I never doubted you.

12:02.901 --> 12:05.770
Every other week I serve at
a soup kitchen downtown.

12:05.772 --> 12:08.005
Ooh, I can't do that.

12:08.007 --> 12:10.975
If I stand over a steaming pot,
my hair just goes boing!

12:12.311 --> 12:13.778
What else could I do?

12:13.780 --> 12:16.647
There's Habitat for Humanity--
building houses for the poor.

12:16.649 --> 12:18.649
Okay, come on, I don't even
have my own house--

12:18.651 --> 12:20.084
I'm going to build one
for someone else?

12:20.086 --> 12:23.554
How about donating
some of your clothes?

12:23.556 --> 12:27.491
Oh, my God, that's perfect.
'Cause I have so many clothes

12:27.493 --> 12:28.993
I don't wear, and they're
just taking up space,

12:28.995 --> 12:31.996
and I go shopping to buy more stuff
and I have no place to put it.

12:31.998 --> 12:33.264
This will totally fix that.

12:33.266 --> 12:34.832
What about helping people?

12:34.834 --> 12:37.234
And helping people.

12:38.537 --> 12:41.138
Here's your cocoa.

12:41.140 --> 12:43.741
- Oh, half and half instead of whole milk?
- Yes.

12:43.743 --> 12:46.143
- Heated to precisely 183 degrees?
- Yes.

12:46.145 --> 12:48.045
Seven little marshmallows,
no more no less?

12:48.047 --> 12:50.348
You got one for good luck.

12:51.450 --> 12:52.850
(knocking)
I'll get it.

12:52.852 --> 12:55.319
One for good luck.

12:55.321 --> 12:58.022
Must be the kind of math
they do at Princeton.

13:01.426 --> 13:03.294
Hey.

13:03.296 --> 13:04.729
What are you doing here?

13:04.731 --> 13:08.899
I want to apologize for...
stapling your balls and...

13:10.102 --> 13:13.270
...throwing you naked
in the girls' locker room,

13:13.272 --> 13:15.172
stuffing that parrot
down your pants.

13:16.975 --> 13:18.109
What's this word?

13:18.810 --> 13:22.079
- "Laxative."
- Oh, right.

13:22.081 --> 13:24.849
Junior prom.

13:24.851 --> 13:27.985
That was not cool, man.

13:27.987 --> 13:30.354
I am so, so sorry.

13:30.356 --> 13:31.722
Really?

13:31.724 --> 13:35.259
Yeah. I just hope
you can forgive me.

13:35.261 --> 13:36.427
LEONARD:
Uh...

13:36.429 --> 13:37.928
Yeah.

13:37.930 --> 13:39.029
Sure, I guess.

13:39.031 --> 13:42.333
You're a beautiful guy.

13:42.335 --> 13:44.335
Well, thanks, Jimmy.

13:44.337 --> 13:45.703
Okay, I got to go.

13:45.705 --> 13:47.838
Are you okay to drive?

13:47.840 --> 13:50.040
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I drive better drunk.

13:50.042 --> 13:52.710
You know, it makes
you pay attention.

13:54.713 --> 13:57.114
No, no, no, come on in.
I'll make you a cup of coffee.

13:57.116 --> 13:58.816
- I wouldn't be imposing?
- No.

13:58.818 --> 14:01.018
Yes.

14:01.020 --> 14:04.288
Sheldon, we can't
let him drive.

14:04.290 --> 14:06.757
Then take away his keys
and make him wander the streets

14:06.759 --> 14:08.692
with the other drunks.

14:10.462 --> 14:13.230
You remember Sheldon
and Raj and Howard.

14:13.232 --> 14:14.799
Not really, no.

14:16.067 --> 14:17.501
It's funny, huh, Leonard?

14:17.503 --> 14:20.404
Back in school, I was the
winner and you were the loser.

14:20.406 --> 14:21.472
And now we're reversed.

14:21.474 --> 14:24.008
You're the winner.

14:24.010 --> 14:26.977
You'd think a winner could make
a decent cup of cocoa.

14:28.680 --> 14:31.682
- You mind if I use your bathroom?
- Yeah, just back there.

14:34.653 --> 14:36.253
How about that?

14:36.255 --> 14:39.356
After all these years,
your big bad high school bully

14:39.358 --> 14:41.125
finally apologizes.

14:41.127 --> 14:43.994
Yeah. It kind of rekindles
your faith

14:43.996 --> 14:46.063
in the basic goodness of people.

14:46.065 --> 14:48.666
You know what
would be nice?

14:48.668 --> 14:49.400
What's that?

14:49.402 --> 14:51.569
As a symbolic gesture

14:51.571 --> 14:54.738
to all the bullies who've
tormented us for years,

14:54.740 --> 14:59.743
we open our home to Jimmy and
once he's asleep we kill him.

15:04.416 --> 15:07.384
I said it would be nice--
I didn't say we should do it.

15:09.921 --> 15:13.424
I feel just like
Mother Teresa.

15:13.426 --> 15:15.192
Except for the virgin part.

15:15.194 --> 15:18.195
That ship sailed
a long time ago.

15:18.197 --> 15:22.967
I think Mother Teresa would
have washed the clothes first.

15:22.969 --> 15:24.869
Yeah, well, I bet
her laundry room

15:24.871 --> 15:26.837
wasn't down five flights
of stairs.

15:26.839 --> 15:30.708
You know, giving really
is better than receiving.

15:30.710 --> 15:34.512
I used to think it was such a cliche,
but it seems to be the...

15:34.514 --> 15:38.182
(gasps) Look at these cute jeans
someone just threw away.

15:38.184 --> 15:40.284
Donated.

15:42.821 --> 15:46.557
Yes, to a poor waitress
who loves a boot cut.

15:47.592 --> 15:48.592
Penny.

15:48.594 --> 15:50.694
Come on, they would
be so cute on me...

15:50.696 --> 15:52.897
They go great
with this sweater!

15:52.899 --> 15:55.032
I don't think
Mother Teresa...

15:55.034 --> 15:56.967
Oh, that is adorable.

16:08.346 --> 16:09.914
Leonard.

16:09.916 --> 16:11.982
- Yeah.
- In case it comes up again,

16:11.984 --> 16:15.786
this right here
is an imposition.

16:17.289 --> 16:18.756
What was I supposed to do?

16:18.758 --> 16:20.491
He needed a place
to sleep it off.

16:20.493 --> 16:22.059
You're soft.

16:22.061 --> 16:25.462
This world's going to chew
you up and spit you out.

16:25.464 --> 16:27.464
(belches)

16:27.466 --> 16:30.267
When did I have tacos?

16:31.903 --> 16:33.404
Morning, Jimmy.

16:33.406 --> 16:37.041
Oh, there it is, tacos.

16:37.043 --> 16:40.177
Man, I tied one on.

16:40.179 --> 16:41.345
Yeah, you did.

16:41.347 --> 16:44.481
So, uh, listen, it was
great to see you again.

16:44.483 --> 16:47.017
And thanks for
the apology.

16:47.019 --> 16:49.153
What apology?

16:49.155 --> 16:52.323
For all the crappy stuff
you did to me in high school.

16:52.325 --> 16:54.658
Geez, you're still harping
on that?

16:54.660 --> 16:55.926
What a puss.

16:55.928 --> 16:58.395
That's my French toast.

16:58.397 --> 17:00.064
It's good.

17:00.066 --> 17:02.800
You really know your way
around a kitchen, Nancy.

17:04.469 --> 17:06.704
I'm not going to say
I told you so,

17:06.730 --> 17:08.278
but we could have killed him.

17:11.175 --> 17:14.211
I might kill him right now.

17:14.213 --> 17:16.847
The Dark Knight
has your back.

17:16.848 --> 17:19.349
He's scared, but
he has your back.

17:19.352 --> 17:21.551
Okay, Jimmy, it's time
for you to go.

17:21.554 --> 17:23.020
Yeah, all right, let
me just finish this.

17:23.021 --> 17:25.388
No, you're done. I want you out
of my apartment right now.

17:25.391 --> 17:28.325
Well said, Boy Wonder.

17:29.160 --> 17:31.862
Or what?

17:31.864 --> 17:32.937
Don't answer that.
It's a trick question.

17:32.962 --> 17:34.162
I speak from experience.

17:37.702 --> 17:40.137
I'm not afraid of you
anymore, Jimmy.

17:40.139 --> 17:41.705
Now get out!

17:42.841 --> 17:44.908
Uh-oh.

17:46.711 --> 17:48.712
You did it, Leonard,
you stood up to your bully.

17:48.714 --> 17:51.315
Yeah, I feel pretty good
about myself.

17:53.118 --> 17:55.519
You think we can
outrun him?

17:55.521 --> 17:58.589
I don't need to outrun him,
I just need to outrun you.

18:04.644 --> 18:06.229
I don't feel
good about this.

18:06.230 --> 18:08.430
Then sit in the car
and keep it running.

18:09.232 --> 18:12.101
You were right--
a whole new load.

18:14.938 --> 18:17.873
Come on, yoga top.
Mama needs a new yoga top.

18:17.875 --> 18:20.542
Check it out, Bernadette,
suede boots, your size.

18:20.544 --> 18:22.678
God, they're cute.

18:22.680 --> 18:25.314
Oh, why did they have
to be cute?

18:25.316 --> 18:28.050
Wait, wait, wait, guys,
just hang on.

18:28.052 --> 18:29.952
What is it, the fuzz?

18:32.355 --> 18:34.390
Look at us.

18:34.392 --> 18:35.858
What are we doing?

18:35.860 --> 18:38.894
I was gleefully following you
to a life of crime,

18:38.896 --> 18:42.231
looking forward to the day
we might be cell mates.

18:44.901 --> 18:47.870
I don't know about Bernadette.

18:47.872 --> 18:52.408
You know, this is wrong.
Let's put everything back.

18:52.410 --> 18:54.677
Here.

19:04.354 --> 19:06.255
It's okay, I serve soup
to poor people!
