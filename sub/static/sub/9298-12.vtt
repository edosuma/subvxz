00:20.222 --> 00:20.863
Hmmm.

00:21.280 --> 00:25.455
Maura, that was
an amazing farewell meal.

00:25.575 --> 00:27.642
Well, I had help
from the guest of honor.

00:27.762 --> 00:29.463
He's a remarkable sous-chef.

00:29.583 --> 00:31.580
Didn't even know what that was
till this afternoon.

00:31.615 --> 00:33.978
Tommy, the vegetables were delicious.

00:34.289 --> 00:36.285
Ma, he sliced a celery stalk.

00:36.525 --> 00:39.686
I cut up the broccoli, too.
Okay, so, when do we get to see

00:39.721 --> 00:41.353
this fabulous apartment of yours?

00:41.473 --> 00:43.523
Soon as I have the money to get
the lights turned on.

00:43.558 --> 00:45.420
Well, I told you
I'd be happy to cosign.

00:45.660 --> 00:46.460
- No.
- No.

00:52.083 --> 00:52.901
No.

00:54.255 --> 00:56.725
But if you need help moving in...

00:56.845 --> 00:59.137
Actually, I moved in today.
A buddy of mine helped me.

00:59.257 --> 01:03.114
Look at him. My baby's leaving
the nest again.

01:03.234 --> 01:05.758
And this time, he's on
the straight and narrow.

01:05.878 --> 01:07.427
Your baby's 32.

01:09.482 --> 01:10.375
Stop it.

01:17.238 --> 01:17.852
Hey.

01:19.877 --> 01:20.575
You're back.

01:21.251 --> 01:21.988
Yeah.

01:23.250 --> 01:25.617
We really didn't get
a chance to talk.

01:26.082 --> 01:28.333
I'm gonna miss our chess games.

01:29.389 --> 01:30.689
Me too.

01:31.234 --> 01:33.334
Anyway, a token of my appreciation.

01:34.893 --> 01:35.593
Wow.

01:35.865 --> 01:38.904
This is a 1994 Chateau de Gordes.

01:39.459 --> 01:40.446
It's very rare.

01:41.527 --> 01:42.314
Yeah...

01:43.350 --> 01:44.290
Like you.

01:51.220 --> 01:51.910
Whoa.

01:55.963 --> 01:57.563
I should finish these dishes.

01:58.575 --> 01:59.687
Yeah. Okay.

02:01.677 --> 02:03.306
Well, good night.

02:06.486 --> 02:07.583
Wait, Tommy.

02:07.703 --> 02:09.228
No, I got to go anyway.

02:09.348 --> 02:11.084
Um, enjoy the wine.

02:13.475 --> 02:15.606
You've been so great to me.

02:16.808 --> 02:17.708
Tommy...

02:32.740 --> 02:35.311
Everybody on the ground!
Facedown! Now!

02:36.331 --> 02:38.496
You trip the silent,
I blow his head off! Get up!

02:39.042 --> 02:40.467
If I don't see cash from that vault

02:40.450 --> 02:42.017
in 30 seconds, you die.

02:43.708 --> 02:44.544
Move it!

02:44.899 --> 02:46.466
Get up!
Get up!

02:46.735 --> 02:49.006
Empty the cash in the
drawers. You two, don't move!

02:51.301 --> 02:52.406
Come on!

02:53.425 --> 02:54.193
Fill it.

03:02.898 --> 03:03.401
Give me the bag.

03:03.521 --> 03:04.739
Get on the ground.
Don't move.

03:04.774 --> 03:06.441
Come on.
Come on, come on!

03:06.561 --> 03:08.099
Let's get out of here.

03:17.382 --> 03:18.040
Go!

03:18.563 --> 03:19.597
Go! Go! Go!

03:31.591 --> 03:35.041
Rizzoli and Isles - S02E12
He Ain't Heavy, He's My Brother

03:35.141 --> 03:37.391
Original air date
December 5, 2011

03:37.491 --> 03:41.013
Sync and corrected by Gatto and Sp8ky
for www.addic7ed.com

03:50.406 --> 03:52.573
What do we got?
Dead bank manager.

03:52.693 --> 03:54.469
Three employees witnessed
the robbery and the shooting.

03:54.589 --> 03:56.541
FBI's inside talking to them.

03:56.661 --> 03:57.844
What are you doing out here?

03:58.242 --> 04:00.295
The FBI has
a pretty high opinion of itself

04:00.330 --> 04:02.213
and a pretty low one
of local law enforcement.

04:02.447 --> 04:03.905
They let Maura and Korsak in.

04:04.285 --> 04:05.505
To process the body.

04:05.625 --> 04:07.047
Well, come on.
The action's inside.

04:07.167 --> 04:08.618
No. I'll wait out here.

04:08.998 --> 04:10.078
It's good.

04:13.716 --> 04:14.806
you were here when it started?

04:14.926 --> 04:16.076
yeah.

04:17.313 --> 04:20.261
Excuse me. I'm detective
Jane Rizzoli, Boston homicide.

04:20.380 --> 04:21.665
Can you direct me
to the agent in charge?

04:21.785 --> 04:22.386
You're looking at her.

04:22.506 --> 04:23.766
Special agent Anna Farrell.

04:24.771 --> 04:25.844
I'm so sorry.

04:25.964 --> 04:27.482
It's okay.
I'm used to it.

04:27.602 --> 04:28.818
A girl running the task force?

04:28.938 --> 04:30.890
- Gee, it never happens to me.
- Jane.

04:31.984 --> 04:34.383
I've allowed your superior
and the medical examiner in

04:34.503 --> 04:35.396
while we interview the witnesses.

04:35.516 --> 04:38.244
Okay. Well,
it may be your bank robbery,

04:38.364 --> 04:39.175
but it's our murder.

04:39.216 --> 04:41.463
- You can never have too many detectives.
- Actually, you can.

04:41.583 --> 04:42.820
A neighboring P.D. managed to bungle

04:42.855 --> 04:44.852
a similar investigation
two weeks ago.

04:45.170 --> 04:47.003
Yeah, I heard about Cambridge.

04:47.417 --> 04:50.402
It's always amateur hour
when campus police are involved.

04:50.795 --> 04:52.569
Boston's the real deal.
Okay?

04:52.689 --> 04:54.882
So, you think it's the same crew
that did the Cambridge robbery.

04:55.002 --> 04:55.561
Appears to be.

04:55.681 --> 04:57.236
They made off with 30 grand
in that robbery.

04:57.356 --> 04:58.704
Today's take was almost $100,000.

04:59.573 --> 05:00.473
Why's the window shattered?

05:00.593 --> 05:01.754
They went out that way.

05:01.975 --> 05:03.511
Door in Cambridge had a sensor.

05:03.546 --> 05:06.446
It triggered a time-delayed
transmitter hidden in the money.

05:06.481 --> 05:09.146
- What was the time delay on the dye pack?
- 10 seconds.

05:09.217 --> 05:11.417
We figure it went off
in the getaway vehicle.

05:11.452 --> 05:13.053
They're smarter this time...

05:13.566 --> 05:14.753
And more lethal.

05:14.788 --> 05:16.637
Witnesses say he didn't resist.

05:16.757 --> 05:17.984
Didn't try to set off an alarm.

05:18.104 --> 05:20.123
- So why'd they shoot him?
- Who is he?

05:20.487 --> 05:22.092
Paul Lanford, 34.

05:22.497 --> 05:24.297
Suffered what appears to be

05:24.332 --> 05:26.097
a single gunshot wound to the chest.

05:26.264 --> 05:28.964
- Oh. That's a shame.
- What?

05:29.084 --> 05:31.101
Quite a bit of intra-abdominal fat.

05:31.173 --> 05:32.342
It's belly fat - You know,

05:32.462 --> 05:34.708
it's linked to high cholesterol,
high insulin levels.

05:34.828 --> 05:36.822
I don't think he's worried

05:36.942 --> 05:38.383
about his cholesterol level, Maura.

05:38.915 --> 05:40.693
I found a witness who got
the first three digits

05:40.813 --> 05:43.146
of the van's license - 82e.

05:43.415 --> 05:44.464
I'll put out a BOLO.

05:44.584 --> 05:45.632
I already did.

05:47.055 --> 05:48.882
Detective Frost, this is...

05:49.419 --> 05:51.126
I should go check in with my team.

05:55.763 --> 05:56.893
What was that?

05:56.928 --> 05:59.293
Stared at her like she was a perp.

05:59.413 --> 06:00.349
You think he stared?

06:00.469 --> 06:02.835
Casual fixation
with no attention to detail?

06:02.955 --> 06:06.527
I think he scrutinized -
Close, attentive examination.

06:06.787 --> 06:09.040
A tad hostile for our friend Barry.

06:09.160 --> 06:11.060
I think they've met before.

06:16.109 --> 06:17.446
Couldn't have been on the job.

06:17.566 --> 06:18.884
Otherwise, I would have met her, too.

06:19.318 --> 06:21.218
Maybe it was when he was in uniform.

06:21.338 --> 06:22.309
It seemed personal.

06:22.429 --> 06:24.090
Did you get the sense
that they'd slept together?

06:24.393 --> 06:25.276
I'm not very good

06:25.396 --> 06:27.222
at figuring out
who's sleeping with whom.

06:27.723 --> 06:29.140
Stick with what you're good at.

06:29.260 --> 06:30.752
What does his body tell you?

06:32.381 --> 06:35.869
The track of the projectile
is through the right lung,

06:35.989 --> 06:37.103
into the heart...

06:37.223 --> 06:39.039
And through the left lung.

06:39.159 --> 06:42.618
And there it is
at the fifth intercostal.

06:51.100 --> 06:52.884
Oh. It's a .40 caliber.

06:53.434 --> 06:55.437
The bank robber shot him
at point-blank range.

06:55.557 --> 06:57.250
He was cooperating.
Why would he do that?

06:57.370 --> 07:00.746
Perhaps your suspect has a smaller
amygdala and prefrontal cortex.

07:00.866 --> 07:02.955
It results in poor impulse control.

07:03.075 --> 07:06.029
Not everyone with a small brain
shoots people.

07:06.131 --> 07:08.502
You sound like my mom
making excuses for Tommy.

07:08.622 --> 07:10.903
"His dyslexia made him do it."

07:12.093 --> 07:13.221
Have you heard from him?

07:13.341 --> 07:14.841
Who - Tommy?
No.

07:14.961 --> 07:17.265
Just wondering if he got turned on.

07:19.221 --> 07:20.599
The lights.

07:20.719 --> 07:22.542
Got his lights turned on.

07:23.448 --> 07:25.148
B.P.D. unit found the getaway van.

07:25.268 --> 07:26.774
- Oh, that's great!
- No, it's not.

07:26.894 --> 07:28.207
The FBI is sitting on it.

07:28.327 --> 07:29.714
Why are they running surveillance?

07:29.834 --> 07:31.098
This is bullshit.

07:31.218 --> 07:32.383
I want that thing processed.
Let's go out there.

07:38.207 --> 07:41.450
Feds. Always make it that much
harder for us to do our jobs.

07:42.267 --> 07:44.534
She dumped your ass, didn't she?

07:45.977 --> 07:47.086
When and where?

07:47.346 --> 07:48.824
Oh, about three years ago
at the corner

07:48.944 --> 07:51.549
- of "none of your business" and "don't ask."
- Oh.

07:53.190 --> 07:54.976
- Agent Farrell.
- Detective Rizzoli.

07:55.253 --> 07:56.283
Detective Frost.

07:56.921 --> 07:58.419
We're running
a surveillance operation.

07:58.420 --> 08:00.257
- Why are you here?
- You really think they're coming back

08:00.377 --> 08:02.518
to ride around in a van
they used in a bank robbery?

08:02.778 --> 08:04.983
The plates on the van were
stolen from a mall last night.

08:05.103 --> 08:07.185
- We've been sitting on it for an hour.
- It's been dumped.

08:07.305 --> 08:10.145
And we need to get our people
from the crime lab in that van.

08:10.265 --> 08:14.593
- No. We're sitting tight.
- Great. Well, you sit tight and watch that empty van

08:14.713 --> 08:17.114
while our killers are out there
robbing banks and shooting people.

08:19.432 --> 08:21.245
Okay, what happened between you two?

08:21.505 --> 08:24.624
He, uh, wouldn't put
the toilet seat down.

08:25.004 --> 08:26.381
Okay.

08:26.501 --> 08:28.292
- Can I take a look?
- Sure.

08:28.412 --> 08:29.105
Thank you.

08:39.106 --> 08:39.905
Frost!

08:41.063 --> 08:42.605
Wait!
What are you doing!?

08:46.976 --> 08:47.776
Frost!

08:48.916 --> 08:49.782
Police!

09:00.468 --> 09:01.993
95.6.

09:02.285 --> 09:05.327
Liver temp indicates he's been
dead about two hours.

09:05.496 --> 09:07.929
CSRU says the van's been
wiped down pretty clean.

09:08.049 --> 09:09.975
No prints on the wheel or doors.

09:10.095 --> 09:12.103
Okay. Let's get latent prints
out here, see what they can find.

09:12.223 --> 09:14.070
Perhaps this will help.

09:14.414 --> 09:15.268
A hair.

09:15.388 --> 09:16.890
- Do you see a root ball?
- Yes.

09:17.265 --> 09:19.207
I'll have it run through CODIS.

09:19.910 --> 09:22.410
Blood spatter indicates
he was shot inside this van.

09:22.530 --> 09:24.314
This is strange-looking blood.

09:24.582 --> 09:28.201
Do you see why I will only
commit to a reddish-brown stain?

09:28.698 --> 09:30.185
This is not blood.

09:30.388 --> 09:32.679
Well, what is it, then,
Dr. Smarty Pants?

09:32.926 --> 09:34.251
Paint.
Yeah.

09:34.371 --> 09:38.461
- See? I see flecks of avocado green, Tiffany blue...
- Enough, Picasso.

09:38.581 --> 09:40.631
Okay. So, this van

09:40.751 --> 09:43.064
was used for commercial painting
at some point.

09:43.184 --> 09:44.666
Agent Farrell, look.

09:45.958 --> 09:47.713
You see the red spray on the roof?

09:49.969 --> 09:51.303
They tried to wipe it off.

09:51.645 --> 09:53.575
Yeah.
That's from the dye pack.

09:53.877 --> 09:55.444
Must be from the Cambridge robbery.

09:55.739 --> 09:57.078
I'm gonna run this van number.

09:58.230 --> 09:59.513
Well, if we're lucky,

09:59.633 --> 10:01.198
it'll be registered to the dead guy.

10:07.715 --> 10:08.572
Do you recognize him?

10:10.407 --> 10:12.193
He was on our list of suspects.

10:18.051 --> 10:19.906
John Polk, 31.

10:20.026 --> 10:21.105
Convicted of bank robbery --

10:21.225 --> 10:23.291
Released last spring
after serving 10 years.

10:23.541 --> 10:25.672
That's Ricky Dunn,
his partner in that robbery --

10:25.792 --> 10:27.144
Also recently paroled.

10:27.545 --> 10:29.316
Huh.
I'm thinking they reunited.

10:29.942 --> 10:30.708
Frost, bring up

10:30.828 --> 10:32.182
the bank surveillance footage.

10:32.928 --> 10:34.047
How tall was John Polk?

10:35.504 --> 10:36.381
6'2".

10:36.929 --> 10:38.041
And what about Ricky Dunn?

10:38.684 --> 10:39.451
5'7".

10:39.571 --> 10:40.259
Got it.

10:41.597 --> 10:42.255
Freeze it.

10:43.728 --> 10:45.718
Well, that looks about right,
don't you think?

10:46.096 --> 10:48.662
John Polk, our 6'2" dead guy,
is the shooter.

10:48.740 --> 10:50.910
Ricky Dunn is his 5'7" accomplice.

10:51.030 --> 10:53.504
- What do you know about Dunn?
- We checked with his parole officer.

10:53.624 --> 10:55.303
He hasn't reported in
for the last two weeks.

10:55.423 --> 10:58.105
So, when you told us
he was "on your list,"

10:58.544 --> 10:59.940
he was really your prime suspect.

11:00.060 --> 11:02.375
Do we need to speak privately,
detective Frost?

11:02.495 --> 11:03.866
No, I'm good.

11:05.549 --> 11:07.523
Well, that's quite a history.

11:08.297 --> 11:10.170
Ricky Dunn is prone to violence.

11:10.869 --> 11:12.248
History of drug use, gambling.

11:12.368 --> 11:14.488
But not John Polk. He came
from a middle-class home.

11:14.608 --> 11:15.914
No drug use, no violence.

11:16.034 --> 11:17.853
Till he robbed a bank with Dunn.

11:17.973 --> 11:20.190
But this time, Polk kills
the bank manager. Why?

11:20.376 --> 11:21.328
Got nervous.

11:21.448 --> 11:22.722
Accidentally pulled the trigger.

11:23.443 --> 11:24.226
Yeah, maybe.

11:25.334 --> 11:26.267
Frost, can you slow it down?

11:28.744 --> 11:30.255
So, Polk turns to go,

11:30.295 --> 11:31.548
but then he turns back.

11:32.279 --> 11:34.143
- It's like he's making a decision.
- Yeah.

11:34.263 --> 11:35.189
To kill him.

11:36.504 --> 11:38.280
Frost, try a search with both names --

11:38.400 --> 11:39.944
John Polk and Paul Lanford.

11:40.204 --> 11:41.548
- You think they knew each other?
- Mm-hmm.

11:41.747 --> 11:43.565
If they did, this is an inside job.

11:46.173 --> 11:47.543
Yeah. Look.

11:48.639 --> 11:51.128
Robber and bank manager played
on the same all-star hockey team.

11:51.248 --> 11:52.943
Maybe Paul Lanford
got the job at the bank

11:53.037 --> 11:53.930
to set the whole thing up.

11:54.557 --> 11:56.798
- Detective frost, can you check Lanford's
- Credit report?

11:56.918 --> 11:57.920
I'm already doing it.

12:01.679 --> 12:04.326
- You think Polk double-crossed Lanford?
- Maybe.

12:04.937 --> 12:07.073
He was already splitting the
money with his partner, Dunn,

12:07.193 --> 12:08.244
plus the getaway driver.

12:09.183 --> 12:10.154
Okay.

12:12.144 --> 12:14.145
So, maxed out on his cards.

12:14.401 --> 12:15.997
Behind on all his payments.

12:16.117 --> 12:17.104
Serious debt.

12:17.224 --> 12:18.937
Lanford need to rob his own bank.

12:19.057 --> 12:20.237
This will be awkward, then.

12:20.519 --> 12:22.111
Paul Lanford's widow
is in the conference room.

12:23.558 --> 12:24.530
Be right there.

12:24.790 --> 12:25.710
I'm going.

12:26.591 --> 12:27.395
Frost, you coming?

12:27.515 --> 12:28.784
I'll sit this one out.

12:39.384 --> 12:40.418
Mrs. Lanford?

12:41.311 --> 12:43.049
We're sorry for your loss.

12:44.969 --> 12:46.269
If it's all right with you,

12:46.389 --> 12:48.039
we'd like to ask you some questions

12:48.159 --> 12:48.885
about your husband.

12:50.577 --> 12:51.437
Okay.

12:51.768 --> 12:54.212
Can you tell us how long
Paul worked at the bank?

12:54.917 --> 12:55.904
Just a few months.

12:56.360 --> 12:58.627
He'd been unemployed for a year.

12:59.229 --> 13:00.729
Things were finally looking up.

13:01.371 --> 13:02.276
Do you know this man?

13:03.110 --> 13:03.861
John Polk.

13:04.379 --> 13:05.350
No.

13:05.873 --> 13:06.548
Why?

13:06.983 --> 13:08.440
Your husband did.

13:09.286 --> 13:10.728
They played hockey together.

13:12.946 --> 13:15.296
I'm confused.
This was years ago.

13:15.416 --> 13:17.379
But both were in the bank
when it was robbed this morning,

13:17.499 --> 13:18.789
and now both are dead.

13:19.786 --> 13:21.732
My husband was at his job.

13:21.852 --> 13:22.934
What are you saying?

13:23.054 --> 13:23.870
We have reason to believe

13:23.990 --> 13:25.823
that he may have been involved
in the robbery.

13:25.858 --> 13:27.484
He was killed by the robbers.

13:27.604 --> 13:29.293
We've looked
into your financial records.

13:29.328 --> 13:30.825
Paul would never do anything illegal.

13:30.945 --> 13:33.124
You were having
some serious troubles.

13:34.193 --> 13:35.943
Please understand

13:36.403 --> 13:39.236
that we just need to explore
all the possibilities.

13:39.356 --> 13:40.689
I understand.

13:43.942 --> 13:45.681
But I don't understand her.

13:52.230 --> 13:54.188
Let's get these out of here.

13:59.514 --> 14:01.880
Tactful warmth isn't my strong suit.

14:02.000 --> 14:03.010
You're amazing.

14:03.097 --> 14:05.897
Oh. Well, I've just been at it
a long time.

14:06.017 --> 14:08.540
A lots of families, a lot of grief.

14:08.665 --> 14:11.732
I don't think Paul Lanford had
anything to do with it. You?

14:11.967 --> 14:13.605
- I'm not sure.
- Mmm.

14:13.640 --> 14:14.990
I hope I didn't screw that up.

14:15.025 --> 14:16.696
Go easy on yourself, all right?

14:16.816 --> 14:17.808
It's okay.
You'll get there.

14:22.837 --> 14:24.294
You okay?
That doesn't look good.

14:24.560 --> 14:26.500
Just something
I have to handle right away.

14:26.620 --> 14:28.549
- All right.
- Well, let me know if something develops in the case.

14:29.401 --> 14:30.372
Sure thing.

14:32.252 --> 14:33.937
John Polk's parents are on a cruise.

14:34.057 --> 14:35.009
Found a brother - David.

14:35.129 --> 14:36.538
We're gonna have to do
a notification.

14:36.658 --> 14:37.603
Okay.
I'll go with you.

14:38.528 --> 14:39.358
I like her.

14:39.922 --> 14:41.896
So did frost - a lot.

14:42.468 --> 14:43.807
Look what I found.

14:45.546 --> 14:46.840
They were engaged?

14:46.179 --> 14:47.134
Sign here.

14:49.800 --> 14:51.446
No wonder he's so grumpy.

14:51.744 --> 14:52.918
Man with a lot of secrets.

14:55.341 --> 14:56.249
Come on.

14:56.369 --> 14:58.756
Let's go tell John Polk's
brother the bad news.

15:00.808 --> 15:04.192
The wheels on the bus
go 'round and 'round

15:04.312 --> 15:05.751
'round and 'round

15:05.871 --> 15:07.537
'round and 'round

15:08.320 --> 15:09.361
Hang on, kids.

15:11.375 --> 15:12.362
Can I help you?

15:12.482 --> 15:14.325
Yeah. Hi.
We're looking for a David Polk.

15:15.527 --> 15:19.004
- That's me.
- Could we speak to you in private, please?

15:19.866 --> 15:22.341
- I'll watch Phoebe.
- Phoebe, honey, I want you to go with miss Sophie.

15:22.764 --> 15:24.816
Play with Timmy
so daddy can talk, okay?

15:27.331 --> 15:29.715
I'm sergeant Korsak.
This is detective Rizzoli.

15:30.403 --> 15:31.926
Are you able to reach your parents?

15:32.046 --> 15:34.452
No. They're traveling.
What's the matter?

15:34.584 --> 15:36.222
It's about your brother, John.

15:37.139 --> 15:38.330
What'd he do this time?

15:38.627 --> 15:40.664
He's a suspect in a bank robbery
that occurred this morning.

15:42.387 --> 15:43.688
He just got out of prison.

15:44.732 --> 15:47.275
If you're looking for him,
I don't know where he is.

15:48.090 --> 15:49.374
We're sorry to tell you...

15:49.672 --> 15:51.787
Your brother John
was shot and killed.

15:53.635 --> 15:54.657
What?

15:56.659 --> 15:57.881
Oh, my god.

16:00.466 --> 16:01.359
Uh...

16:03.818 --> 16:04.711
Who shot him?

16:04.998 --> 16:06.559
We think it was connected
to the bank robbery.

16:08.314 --> 16:10.006
Do you know this man --

16:10.126 --> 16:10.798
Paul Lanford?

16:12.544 --> 16:13.296
Yeah.

16:13.988 --> 16:15.111
I helped coach the hockey team

16:15.231 --> 16:16.964
my brother and Paul played on.

16:17.084 --> 16:18.844
I couldn't play 'cause
my achilles tendon snapped.

16:19.418 --> 16:21.570
- Paul was a manager at the bank.
- "Was"?

16:21.690 --> 16:23.564
He was killed during the robbery.

16:25.857 --> 16:27.071
Did my brother do that?

16:27.455 --> 16:28.567
Do you know this man?

16:30.353 --> 16:31.284
Yeah.

16:31.994 --> 16:33.013
Ricky Dunn.

16:33.279 --> 16:35.159
I warned my brother
to stay away from Ricky.

16:35.827 --> 16:37.509
10 years of hard time they did.

16:38.085 --> 16:40.296
I told John, "stay away
from all your ex-con buddies."

16:40.934 --> 16:43.383
Do you know any of the names
of those ex-cons?

16:43.503 --> 16:45.485
We believe there was a third
person involved in the robbery.

16:45.837 --> 16:46.667
No.

16:49.054 --> 16:52.548
My brother and I lived
in two totally different worlds.

16:53.313 --> 16:54.096
Daddy.

16:56.812 --> 16:58.262
I'm sorry.
My daughter needs me.

16:58.655 --> 17:00.067
I'll try to find my parents.

17:00.864 --> 17:01.804
Thank you.

17:20.118 --> 17:21.214
Red particulate.

17:21.654 --> 17:23.487
Residue from the exploded dye pack.

17:23.800 --> 17:25.569
It's still moist, which is curious

17:25.690 --> 17:27.779
since the first bank robbery
was two weeks ago.

17:29.243 --> 17:30.214
Dr. Isles, I'd like you

17:30.334 --> 17:32.298
to take a look
at the latent-print findings.

17:32.418 --> 17:33.839
On the van?
You got a hit?

17:34.099 --> 17:35.227
Three, actually.

17:35.347 --> 17:37.302
- You should have the report.
- Oh.

17:44.295 --> 17:46.645
John Polk's prints
were on the gas cap.

17:46.927 --> 17:49.361
Ricky Dunn's were
on the interior ceiling.

17:49.659 --> 17:52.338
We found a third partial print
on the rear-view mirror.

17:52.949 --> 17:54.421
Presumably the van's driver?

17:54.703 --> 17:55.236
Yes.

17:57.351 --> 17:58.213
It's not here.

17:59.090 --> 18:00.625
I have the only hard copy.

18:07.596 --> 18:08.787
This can't be right.

18:09.053 --> 18:09.805
It's Tommy.

18:09.925 --> 18:11.325
This matter is under investigation

18:11.445 --> 18:12.703
by a federal grand jury.

18:12.823 --> 18:14.709
By virtue of title 18, rule 6e,

18:14.829 --> 18:16.620
neither you
nor any member of your team

18:16.740 --> 18:18.343
is to disseminate any information

18:18.463 --> 18:20.674
about said individual
as it relates to this case

18:20.794 --> 18:22.318
under penalty of prosecution.

18:22.438 --> 18:24.026
Okay. There has to be
some other explanation.

18:24.146 --> 18:27.198
None of this is to be shared
with anyone in Boston P.D.

18:27.856 --> 18:30.049
That includes the suspect's sister,

18:30.305 --> 18:31.980
detective Jane Rizzoli.

18:51.542 --> 18:53.208
Prison tats.

18:54.365 --> 18:56.853
We notified his brother
at a "mommy and me" class.

18:56.973 --> 18:58.696
Can't believe
they're from the same family.

18:59.234 --> 19:01.192
Birth order is a significant factor.

19:01.536 --> 19:04.575
The oldest child is typically
highly motivated, like you,

19:04.695 --> 19:06.348
- while the youngest --
- Robs banks?

19:08.085 --> 19:10.779
I was gonna say, uh,
they tend to be coddled.

19:10.899 --> 19:12.562
Pick interests diametrically opposite

19:12.682 --> 19:13.596
to their older siblings.

19:13.716 --> 19:15.946
Tend to be... Risk-takers.

19:16.066 --> 19:18.866
Oh, I see you've read
the Rizzoli family study.

19:20.448 --> 19:21.685
Have you heard from Tommy yet?

19:22.679 --> 19:23.431
No.

19:23.557 --> 19:25.249
And that's the second time
you've asked me.

19:25.369 --> 19:26.205
Look who's coddling.

19:28.920 --> 19:30.158
Are you okay?
You're acting weird.

19:30.278 --> 19:32.210
Mmm. Stomachache.

19:32.994 --> 19:34.623
You don't have stomachaches.

19:34.743 --> 19:39.219
You have gastro-stomach-opolitis
aches.

19:39.595 --> 19:40.507
From what?

19:40.627 --> 19:42.744
Gastralgia...
From stress.

19:42.864 --> 19:45.181
So stop staring at whatever's
under that microscope.

19:45.301 --> 19:47.312
It's the hair I found
in John Polk's coveralls.

19:47.432 --> 19:48.926
We got a DNA match in CODIS.

19:49.046 --> 19:50.210
It belongs to Ricky Dunn.

19:50.508 --> 19:51.354
Well, that's no surprise.

19:51.432 --> 19:52.914
We know that John Polk and Ricky Dunn

19:53.034 --> 19:54.013
liked robbing banks together.

19:54.133 --> 19:56.862
The crime lab also found
a trace compound on it --

19:56.982 --> 19:58.570
Zinc stearate.

20:00.230 --> 20:01.593
Which is?

20:01.713 --> 20:04.074
It's a chief ingredient
in fanning powder.

20:04.194 --> 20:05.657
Fanning powder?
Wh--

20:06.737 --> 20:08.351
They use that on decks of cards.

20:08.471 --> 20:10.269
To decrease friction, Yes.

20:11.804 --> 20:13.448
Yeah, the FBI profile on Dunn

20:13.568 --> 20:15.140
said he was prone to gambling.

20:15.694 --> 20:18.461
And he's got his share of
100,000 bucks to launder.

20:18.581 --> 20:20.868
Hang on a second.
Hey, frost.

20:20.988 --> 20:23.829
I want to know about every underground
gambling operation in Boston --

20:23.949 --> 20:25.950
Dice, cards, whatever.

20:26.070 --> 20:27.125
Okay. Thanks.

20:27.861 --> 20:28.676
I got to go.

20:32.378 --> 20:33.919
How bad is this stomachache?

20:35.590 --> 20:36.355
Bad.

20:37.247 --> 20:39.024
I'm gonna finish up here and go home.

20:39.967 --> 20:41.252
All right.
I'll call you later.

20:55.197 --> 20:56.666
Maura.

20:56.701 --> 20:58.635
Sorry. I didn't mean to scare you.

20:59.017 --> 20:59.832
What are you doing here?

20:59.952 --> 21:00.850
Look, Maura...

21:02.197 --> 21:05.283
Sometimes I do stupid, crazy things.

21:06.286 --> 21:08.808
I feel -- I feel terrible.

21:08.928 --> 21:09.795
I'm really sorry.

21:10.179 --> 21:11.863
Tommy, you are in serious trouble.

21:12.740 --> 21:14.805
What, did you tell Jane?
Does she know?

21:14.840 --> 21:16.892
I can't discuss this with you. I --

21:21.200 --> 21:22.861
FBI!
Get your hands up!

21:23.331 --> 21:24.537
Get your hands up!

21:24.860 --> 21:26.160
Whoa.
Hey!

21:26.298 --> 21:26.298
Tommy!
Stop! You're hurting him!

21:26.333 --> 21:29.250
- Get off me! I didn't do anything.
- Let him go!

21:29.285 --> 21:32.168
- Let's go.
- Get off me! I didn't do anything!

21:32.288 --> 21:36.164
- Wait! Tommy!
- I didn't do anything!

21:36.284 --> 21:37.057
Tommy!

21:47.916 --> 21:49.784
- All right.
- I'm in.

21:49.904 --> 21:50.568
Let's hit him quick.

21:50.688 --> 21:52.181
Dunn's got a history of violence.

21:54.766 --> 21:55.957
Get those hands up!

21:57.946 --> 22:00.939
- It's Dunn!
- I got him. I got him! I got him!

22:09.082 --> 22:10.116
Let me see your hands.

22:13.328 --> 22:15.584
I'm not going back to prison.
Drop your weapon, Dunn.

22:27.482 --> 22:28.579
Is that Ricky Dunn?

22:28.876 --> 22:29.409
Yeah.

22:29.691 --> 22:30.490
He's dead.

22:32.041 --> 22:32.887
That's two.

22:33.168 --> 22:34.375
Just leaves the getaway driver.

22:34.831 --> 22:35.832
We just took him into custody.

22:36.395 --> 22:38.633
His prints were discovered
in the van by the latent team.

22:38.753 --> 22:39.381
Really?

22:39.819 --> 22:40.681
Who is he?

22:41.229 --> 22:42.420
Another ex-con --

22:43.626 --> 22:44.503
Tommy Rizzoli.

22:45.522 --> 22:46.367
Does Jane know?

22:48.059 --> 22:48.655
Damn it!

22:48.775 --> 22:49.955
You didn't tell her?!

23:04.429 --> 23:05.228
Maura...

23:05.572 --> 23:08.094
Second-degree mid-dermal burns
from the exploding dye pack.

23:08.214 --> 23:10.053
Yeah, that's what you do --
You hide behind science.

23:10.173 --> 23:12.316
You knew the FBI
was about to arrest Tommy.

23:12.687 --> 23:13.780
Check your messages.

23:13.900 --> 23:15.383
I called you the second that I could.

23:15.477 --> 23:17.373
You should have called
me before he was arrested.

23:17.493 --> 23:18.956
Look, title 18 forbids me from

23:19.081 --> 23:20.930
I don't give a damn about title 18!

23:21.290 --> 23:23.828
- There are ways to tell me without telling me.
- Really?

23:23.948 --> 23:25.905
Well, the justice department
could have indicted me

23:26.025 --> 23:28.239
for the mere act
of disclosing my knowledge

23:28.359 --> 23:30.088
of their intent to arrest Tommy.

23:30.208 --> 23:32.234
That is 10 years in a federal prison,

23:32.354 --> 23:33.895
plus the loss of my medical license.

23:34.015 --> 23:35.938
You didn't trust me enough
to protect you.

23:36.058 --> 23:37.551
And you didn't protect me.

23:37.645 --> 23:39.023
- Jane...
- And what is this?

23:39.149 --> 23:41.426
Farrell tells me that you were
with him when he was arrested.

23:41.546 --> 23:43.103
I can't wait to hear
the explanation for that.

23:43.065 --> 23:45.166
Oh, no. I'm sorry. I forgot.
You can't talk to me.

23:46.387 --> 23:47.969
He found me in the parking lot.

23:48.089 --> 23:49.567
He wanted to apologize.

23:49.839 --> 23:51.634
Oh, yeah?
"Hi, Maura.

23:51.754 --> 23:54.391
"I'm sorry I was the getaway
driver in a bank robbery.

23:54.511 --> 23:55.911
Sorry somebody got gunned down."

23:56.210 --> 23:58.616
I think he wanted to apologize
for trying to kiss me.

24:03.171 --> 24:05.480
What, did Tommy make you
sign a title 18, too?

24:05.600 --> 24:06.774
We were embarrassed, okay?

24:06.894 --> 24:08.775
I thought it'd be better
if we just forgot about it.

24:09.168 --> 24:11.909
Jane, Farrell got to Cavanaugh.

24:12.740 --> 24:15.741
I'm sorry. He made me and Korsak
the lead on the two homicides.

24:16.552 --> 24:17.478
Okay.

24:18.346 --> 24:19.545
You see that, Maura?

24:20.046 --> 24:21.246
That's what friends do.

24:21.506 --> 24:22.568
They tell you.

24:24.558 --> 24:25.560
Excuse me.

24:25.680 --> 24:26.735
I have to go check on something.

24:31.153 --> 24:33.283
Uh, I'm off the case, frost.

24:33.403 --> 24:35.101
My brother is a suspect.

24:37.958 --> 24:40.539
This is all Farrell. You
know what? She doesn't even --

24:40.659 --> 24:41.906
What the hell went down
between you two?

24:43.550 --> 24:45.133
She married the job instead of me.

24:45.800 --> 24:46.725
This is her fault.

24:49.779 --> 24:51.234
She's just doing her job.

24:51.706 --> 24:53.007
So was Maura.

24:54.039 --> 24:56.678
What, did Farrell
make you sign a title 18, too?

24:56.798 --> 24:58.715
No. She made Dr. Isles, didn't she?

25:00.516 --> 25:02.079
I'm going to talk to David Polk.

25:02.797 --> 25:03.872
Jane, you can't.

25:03.992 --> 25:05.476
I'm not going as a cop.

25:05.596 --> 25:06.823
I'm going as Tommy's sister.

25:14.045 --> 25:15.299
Thanks for seeing me, Mr. Polk.

25:15.419 --> 25:16.536
No. Please, call me David.

25:16.656 --> 25:19.325
Sorry about the mess.
Phoebe's with her mom today.

25:19.575 --> 25:22.728
We're, uh... Separated.

25:23.323 --> 25:24.592
I'm a really bad housekeeper.

25:24.712 --> 25:25.548
It's fine.

25:26.096 --> 25:27.349
Please don't worry about it.

25:28.446 --> 25:29.683
Oh.

25:29.803 --> 25:32.650
I was just wondering
if you would look at a picture

25:32.770 --> 25:36.410
and -- and... Tell me
if you recognize this person.

25:37.836 --> 25:38.586
Yeah.

25:39.293 --> 25:40.909
That's one of John's ex-con buddies.

25:43.621 --> 25:45.288
He's my brother.

25:48.133 --> 25:49.574
Was he part of the robbery crew?

25:49.694 --> 25:50.686
It's looking that way.

25:51.287 --> 25:52.237
The FBI thinks

25:52.357 --> 25:54.775
that he was possibly
the getaway driver.

25:55.809 --> 25:56.466
I'm sorry.

25:57.850 --> 25:59.668
Does it help that I know
exactly how you feel?

26:00.467 --> 26:02.722
I just never thought
I'd be on this side of this, you know.

26:05.204 --> 26:06.488
If it's any consolation,

26:06.608 --> 26:08.243
at least you can still ask
your brother why.

26:20.609 --> 26:21.658
I need to talk to you.

26:22.379 --> 26:23.789
Give us a minute.

26:27.562 --> 26:29.329
I told you you couldn't see him.

26:31.747 --> 26:33.283
Let me talk to him, please.

26:36.745 --> 26:38.258
All I can give you is two minutes.

26:39.247 --> 26:39.921
Thanks.

26:48.608 --> 26:49.811
Jane. Thank god.

26:53.089 --> 26:53.966
Why?

26:55.564 --> 26:57.209
How could you be a part of this?

26:58.096 --> 26:59.762
That bank manager is dead.

27:00.749 --> 27:03.083
John Polk is dead, too.

27:03.203 --> 27:04.164
God, Tommy...

27:04.901 --> 27:07.235
Jane, are you crying?
Don't cry.

27:07.355 --> 27:09.224
- I'm not crying.
- I didn't do this!

27:09.344 --> 27:12.959
Your fingerprints are all over
the rear-view mirror...

27:13.219 --> 27:14.775
In the getaway van.

27:14.895 --> 27:17.005
John let me use his van to move.

27:18.192 --> 27:19.216
John was my friend.

27:19.336 --> 27:20.750
That's why my prints were there.

27:22.890 --> 27:24.300
Then what about Ricky Dunn?

27:25.569 --> 27:27.057
He's John Polk's partner.

27:27.177 --> 27:28.702
They used to rob banks together.

27:28.822 --> 27:29.939
Did you know him, too?

27:30.059 --> 27:33.021
Not all of us ex-cons
know each other.

27:39.076 --> 27:40.941
Tell me where you were
yesterday morning.

27:41.988 --> 27:44.908
I was in my new place, sleeping.

27:45.890 --> 27:48.161
It's a crap alibi,
but it's the truth.

27:50.059 --> 27:52.768
And why did you borrow a van

27:52.888 --> 27:55.322
from a convicted bank robber?

27:55.929 --> 27:57.437
John served his time.

27:57.801 --> 28:00.366
He was starting
a house-painting business.

28:00.869 --> 28:03.531
He was working his ass off
to turn his life around.

28:04.206 --> 28:06.163
He asked me to work a job with him --

28:06.585 --> 28:08.277
A house-painting job.

28:09.352 --> 28:11.858
Jane, I told them all this.
They don't believe me.

28:13.378 --> 28:14.741
But I thought you would.

28:16.527 --> 28:17.107
Time's up.

28:23.106 --> 28:24.516
All right, all right!

28:25.083 --> 28:26.866
Tommy, look at me.

28:29.694 --> 28:30.704
Did you do this?

28:32.540 --> 28:33.331
No.

28:34.212 --> 28:35.857
Then I won't let you
go back to prison.

28:36.585 --> 28:37.294
I promise.

28:43.514 --> 28:45.773
He said
John Polk was painting a house

28:45.893 --> 28:46.917
during the time of the robbery.

28:47.309 --> 28:49.204
We found paint in Polk's van.

28:49.324 --> 28:50.520
If John Polk was still alive,

28:50.640 --> 28:52.980
I'd be charging him with bank
robbery and felony murder,

28:53.226 --> 28:53.982
just like your brother.

28:54.076 --> 28:55.314
What if he's telling the truth?

28:55.812 --> 28:57.617
That's for a jury to decide.

28:58.825 --> 28:59.888
I'm sorry.

29:11.774 --> 29:14.064
Too bad you can't live
in your microscopic world.

29:15.802 --> 29:18.253
Makes more sense
than the macro world right now.

29:18.566 --> 29:19.896
Yeah.

29:21.498 --> 29:23.395
My brother's facing a life sentence.

29:31.620 --> 29:33.789
The faint red
that you noted in the van

29:33.909 --> 29:35.999
is disperse red 9 aerosol.

29:36.550 --> 29:37.770
It was the dye pack.

29:38.662 --> 29:41.113
So, the same paint
you found under Polk's nails.

29:41.558 --> 29:43.124
Uh, no.
That is an oil-based paint.

29:44.761 --> 29:46.432
- A house paint?
- Yes.

29:46.635 --> 29:48.936
I found the same paint
particulates in his nostrils.

29:48.971 --> 29:51.237
The moisture levels indicate
that he'd been painting

29:51.357 --> 29:52.667
within the last 24 hours.

29:53.103 --> 29:54.403
So Tommy was telling the truth.

29:54.994 --> 29:56.559
John was painting yesterday morning.

29:56.679 --> 29:59.011
If he was doing that, he couldn't
possibly be robbing a bank.

29:59.131 --> 30:00.039
Unlike electrons,

30:00.065 --> 30:02.180
human beings can't be
in two places at once.

30:02.215 --> 30:04.012
Physical laws of quantum mechanics.

30:05.407 --> 30:07.218
I kind of love that you know that.

30:07.565 --> 30:10.156
You do?
So, you don't hate me?

30:10.276 --> 30:11.725
- No. I still hate you.
- Okay.

30:11.845 --> 30:13.725
- I'll work on hating you, too.
- Wait a minute.

30:13.775 --> 30:16.357
The only one that we know
for sure who robbed that bank

30:16.400 --> 30:17.187
was Ricky Dunn.

30:17.585 --> 30:19.506
What if Tommy and John
had nothing to do with it?

30:19.979 --> 30:21.367
My stomachache would go away.

30:21.487 --> 30:22.806
Yeah, me too.
Wh--

30:23.052 --> 30:25.193
Can you isolate the manufacturer
of that red paint

30:25.313 --> 30:27.191
and find out where it was being used?

30:27.513 --> 30:29.725
If we prove that John was painting,

30:29.922 --> 30:33.002
then at least a piece
of Tommy's story is true.

30:33.122 --> 30:35.772
There are 285 shades of red.

30:35.892 --> 30:38.251
Multiply 285 by the names

30:38.371 --> 30:42.110
that paint companies assign
to the shades -- really.

30:42.532 --> 30:44.814
- Yes.
- Good.

30:44.934 --> 30:46.170
And I'll do my gumshoe thing.

30:46.290 --> 30:49.616
There's only like, you know,
3,000 streets in Boston.

30:49.644 --> 30:51.174
I kind of love that you can do that.

30:52.633 --> 30:53.356
Well...

30:53.476 --> 30:55.122
Then I hate you a little bit less.

30:58.535 --> 31:00.132
I think we still have
two bank robbers out there.

31:00.150 --> 31:02.160
I got to go.
Jane...

31:02.280 --> 31:05.094
Do you know how long
you're going to hate me for?

31:05.696 --> 31:07.358
It's too soon to tell.

31:14.375 --> 31:16.967
- They got Tommy's fingerprints.
- And he's a convicted felon.

31:17.005 --> 31:18.948
Tommy's fingerprints are in the van

31:19.068 --> 31:20.924
because he was moving his stuff.

31:21.044 --> 31:22.248
And he called John

31:22.368 --> 31:23.816
because he needed to borrow that van.

31:23.936 --> 31:25.919
20 calls?
They're friends.

31:26.154 --> 31:28.360
Plus, John was trying
to find Tommy some work.

31:28.480 --> 31:30.279
Don't put on mom's
rose-colored glasses, Jane.

31:30.399 --> 31:33.002
- Please.
- Just hear me out, all right?

31:33.941 --> 31:36.974
What if Ricky Dunn
borrowed John's van, too?

31:37.190 --> 31:38.927
But not to move -- To rob a bank.

31:39.047 --> 31:40.639
Okay.
We know the robbery went bad.

31:40.759 --> 31:42.029
Paul Lanford gets killed.

31:42.149 --> 31:44.329
Yeah, and Paul was
John's old friend from hockey.

31:44.449 --> 31:46.460
You know, John
hears about the robbery,

31:46.580 --> 31:47.484
hears about Paul's murder.

31:47.503 --> 31:49.212
Maybe he confronts Ricky.

31:49.446 --> 31:52.483
Ricky panics, kills John, frames him.

31:52.518 --> 31:55.251
Leaves the body with the mask
in the getaway vehicle.

31:55.484 --> 31:59.555
How does any of this
prove that Tommy didn't do it?

32:00.160 --> 32:02.358
It doesn't.

32:02.968 --> 32:04.662
It's colonial red.

32:04.993 --> 32:06.649
You I.D.'d the paint
on John Polk's body?

32:06.968 --> 32:08.546
Yes.
It's very expensive.

32:08.666 --> 32:10.180
Used primarily on doors and trim

32:10.300 --> 32:12.170
- in historic home renovations.
- Okay.

32:12.596 --> 32:13.513
There are only three neighborhoods

32:13.633 --> 32:15.142
with colonial houses still standing.

32:15.424 --> 32:16.748
What do you need us to do?

32:19.584 --> 32:20.823
Okay.

32:21.086 --> 32:22.280
Patrol's got no houses

32:22.315 --> 32:24.449
getting painted red in the north end.

32:24.484 --> 32:25.949
Nothing in Haymarket either.

32:25.984 --> 32:28.818
Keep units going up and down
every block of Boston.

32:30.731 --> 32:32.017
Bric. Rizzoli.

32:33.724 --> 32:36.324
Okay. Hang on a second.
I'm gonna put you on speaker.

32:36.427 --> 32:38.327
It's Frankie.
He says he's got something.

32:38.447 --> 32:39.325
Okay. Go ahead.

32:39.360 --> 32:41.179
We found the house.
It's in Dorchester.

32:41.299 --> 32:42.578
Give me the address.

32:43.057 --> 32:45.010
1772 Mayfair drive.

32:45.208 --> 32:48.054
Got a foreman who will testify
that John Polk was here painting

32:48.082 --> 32:50.645
- during the time of the robbery.
- Thank you, Frankie.

32:51.087 --> 32:52.976
You were right.
John didn't do it.

32:53.011 --> 32:55.021
Yeah, but now we got to prove
Tommy didn't either.

32:55.141 --> 32:56.748
But first we got to find
two bank robbers

32:56.868 --> 32:57.978
who are still out there.

32:58.292 --> 33:01.193
Can you play
the bank-robbery tape again?

33:07.709 --> 33:09.000
It gets me every time --

33:09.120 --> 33:10.230
He shoots an innocent man,

33:10.350 --> 33:11.930
but he walks away like he's got
all the time in the world.

33:12.050 --> 33:13.488
I still say it looks like
they knew each other.

33:13.608 --> 33:14.662
It doesn't make any sense

33:14.690 --> 33:16.540
now that we know
that that's not John Polk.

33:16.660 --> 33:18.408
Can you rewind it and slow it down?

33:18.528 --> 33:20.409
Why?
What are you seeing?

33:20.606 --> 33:23.735
A physical reason
for his deliberate pace.

33:23.835 --> 33:24.433
There.

33:27.494 --> 33:28.752
I don't see anything.

33:29.137 --> 33:29.954
Wait.

33:30.074 --> 33:31.128
That's it.

33:31.248 --> 33:32.545
Watch Lanford's  eyes.

33:32.665 --> 33:35.550
He looks down...
At Polk's ankle.

33:35.851 --> 33:37.213
Achilles tendon, actually.

33:37.333 --> 33:39.091
It ruptured and atrophied
when it healed.

33:39.288 --> 33:41.362
That's what causes
his slight limp. You see it?

33:41.775 --> 33:44.498
Yeah.
Lanford saw it, too.

33:44.618 --> 33:46.507
Polk must have felt
Lanford watching him

33:46.627 --> 33:49.230
and realized that Lanford
recognized him from his limp.

33:49.474 --> 33:52.665
John Polk and David Polk
were the same size, same build.

33:52.785 --> 33:54.158
It's David Polk, the good brother.

33:54.355 --> 33:55.681
The one who stopped playing hockey

33:55.718 --> 33:57.887
when his achilles tendon snapped.

33:59.628 --> 34:00.905
Thanks.

34:01.025 --> 34:04.332
David Polk dropped Phoebe off
20 minutes ago and took off.

34:04.452 --> 34:06.229
She said he did the same thing
two days ago.

34:06.349 --> 34:07.562
The day of the bank robbery. Mm-hmm.

34:07.682 --> 34:09.283
And I think I know
who the driver is --

34:09.402 --> 34:11.094
Carl Parker.
The other dad we saw?

34:11.215 --> 34:13.329
Apparently, he left
with Polk - both times.

34:13.449 --> 34:17.331
Hey, pull up David Polk and
Carl Parker's credit reports.

34:18.656 --> 34:21.041
David Polk declared
bankruptcy last year.

34:21.161 --> 34:22.092
He's divorced.

34:25.313 --> 34:26.510
Oh, man.

34:26.710 --> 34:29.233
Both Polk and Carl Parker
lost their houses.

34:29.353 --> 34:31.609
First bank they hit foreclosed
on Carl Parker's house.

34:31.728 --> 34:34.088
And the second one turned down
Polk for a small business loan.

34:34.208 --> 34:35.980
Look at the bank
that took Polk's home.

34:36.178 --> 34:37.492
Copley Square Bank.

34:37.612 --> 34:39.154
Call Farrell.
Get FBI over there.

34:39.576 --> 34:42.105
Emergency dispatch
to Copley Square Bank.

34:42.143 --> 34:43.523
Oh, crap.
It's already on.

34:43.643 --> 34:44.735
Come on.

34:54.710 --> 34:56.147
He shot a hostage?

34:56.175 --> 34:57.800
He demanded a
helicopter. He didn't get it.

34:57.920 --> 35:00.203
- How many hostages?
- Half a dozen.

35:01.140 --> 35:02.689
There's a second suspect.

35:03.543 --> 35:04.971
- Sniper hit him?
- Yes.

35:05.412 --> 35:06.654
Were we right?
Is it Carl Parker?

35:06.774 --> 35:08.041
Matches his description.

35:08.372 --> 35:11.239
The one who shot the hostage
is probably David Polk.

35:12.206 --> 35:13.549
Damn it.

35:14.319 --> 35:15.515
- All right. Let me talk to them.
- No.

35:15.984 --> 35:17.662
That hostage is bleeding out.

35:17.981 --> 35:20.386
Unless you've got a helicopter
getting them, I'm going in.

35:20.421 --> 35:21.651
- Jane, don't even think about it.
- Forget it.

35:23.288 --> 35:24.588
We need a go on that shot.

35:25.025 --> 35:26.969
This is special agent
Anna Farrell. Take the shot.

35:27.089 --> 35:29.870
- You don't have a shot. He's got a human shield.
- Jane, don't!

35:29.990 --> 35:31.630
- What the hell is she doing?!
- Tell your snipers to stand down!

35:31.996 --> 35:33.398
Stand down, stand down.

35:33.432 --> 35:34.639
Stand down.
All teams, hold fire.

35:34.930 --> 35:37.887
I'm unarmed.
It's all right.

35:47.080 --> 35:48.980
Okay. My name
is detective Jane Rizzoli.

35:49.631 --> 35:51.316
I- I am unarmed.

35:51.685 --> 35:53.385
- I just want to talk.
- Stay back!

35:53.878 --> 35:56.187
Okay, okay.

35:57.491 --> 35:59.258
This woman needs medical treatment.

35:59.691 --> 36:00.959
All right?

36:00.994 --> 36:03.594
Please. You can take me
instead of her, okay?

36:03.927 --> 36:05.360
Look.
Please don't let her die.

36:06.267 --> 36:07.582
Stay back.

36:11.507 --> 36:14.341
David...

36:15.295 --> 36:17.079
... don't let her die.

36:22.204 --> 36:24.279
Bringing the hostage out now.

36:32.788 --> 36:34.544
It's okay.

36:34.664 --> 36:37.661
I know why you're doing this, okay?

36:37.699 --> 36:38.598
You lost your jobs.

36:38.897 --> 36:41.164
You lost your homes, your pride.

36:41.284 --> 36:42.031
My wife left me.

36:42.846 --> 36:45.112
I was just a name on
a spreadsheet to this bank.

36:46.068 --> 36:50.676
So you looked up your brother's
old partner, Ricky Dunn,

36:50.711 --> 36:52.250
'cause you knew
John wouldn't help you.

36:52.370 --> 36:54.581
Shut up!
And you borrowed his van.

36:54.614 --> 36:57.447
But John discovered what you
did, so you shot him.

36:58.278 --> 37:00.283
I didn't kill him.

37:00.958 --> 37:02.414
He was my brother.

37:02.808 --> 37:04.564
And he wouldn't have talked.

37:06.420 --> 37:07.706
So it was Carl.

37:07.826 --> 37:08.578
He was gonna turn us in.

37:09.810 --> 37:10.702
This was your idea.

37:10.730 --> 37:12.044
You're the one who got me into this.

37:12.833 --> 37:15.272
- I think you got yourself into this.
- Yeah, well, we're gonna get out.

37:15.497 --> 37:19.478
The only that is protecting
you two right now is me.

37:19.734 --> 37:23.264
I'm standing between you
and a sniper's bullet.

37:24.626 --> 37:27.809
I'm your only chance.
Come on.

37:27.844 --> 37:30.010
You guys still got
something to live for.

37:30.576 --> 37:32.857
No, I don't.
Not anymore.

37:32.977 --> 37:34.078
Yes, you do.

37:34.198 --> 37:35.768
Think of Phoebe.

37:36.961 --> 37:39.299
All right?
And Timmy.

37:41.074 --> 37:42.483
Come on, come on.

37:43.929 --> 37:44.962
They...

37:45.290 --> 37:46.896
They don't want to see you die.

37:47.016 --> 37:48.374
It doesn't matter what you've done.

37:49.426 --> 37:50.506
Come on, give me the gun.

37:50.543 --> 37:50.975
Come on.

37:53.022 --> 37:54.539
Come on, David.

37:54.844 --> 37:55.675
Give me the gun.

37:56.529 --> 37:57.168
Come on.

38:00.633 --> 38:01.703
Come on.

38:01.823 --> 38:04.247
No!

38:04.858 --> 38:06.201
Get on the floor!

38:10.913 --> 38:12.415
Stay put.
Don't move.

38:28.478 --> 38:28.911
Oh.

38:32.433 --> 38:34.343
I swear to god, Tommy.

38:34.371 --> 38:35.264
If you were involved in this,

38:35.299 --> 38:37.015
I was gonna kill you myself.

38:37.118 --> 38:38.818
Oh, yeah.
That's all we need --

38:38.984 --> 38:41.084
Another Rizzoli charged with murder.

38:41.120 --> 38:42.820
Thank you so much, Jane.

38:43.991 --> 38:44.456
You're welcome.

38:44.491 --> 38:47.457
Next time you need help moving,
just call me, okay?

38:47.491 --> 38:49.524
All charges
have been dropped.

38:49.563 --> 38:50.896
I spoke with your parole officer.

38:51.016 --> 38:52.731
He's waiving your violations.

38:52.851 --> 38:53.634
Thank you.

38:53.669 --> 38:55.402
- Thank you.
- Come on.

38:55.796 --> 38:56.496
We'll drive you home.

38:56.772 --> 38:59.100
Ma, stop.

38:59.495 --> 39:00.504
Hey, ho. Hey.

39:01.260 --> 39:03.626
You gonna put the job ahead of her?

39:06.343 --> 39:07.576
She did.

39:08.317 --> 39:10.149
I heard that you wouldn't put
the toilet seat down.

39:10.847 --> 39:12.747
She told you that?

39:12.867 --> 39:13.581
Yeah.

39:13.972 --> 39:16.733
She said that was the only
thing she didn't like about you.

39:43.233 --> 39:44.256
Mm-mmm!

39:46.331 --> 39:47.683
I'm having grilled cheese.

39:47.803 --> 39:50.273
Oh, it goes with anything.
It's a 1994 Chateau de Gordes.

39:50.968 --> 39:53.862
Again?
I'm so sick of that.

39:54.358 --> 39:55.691
It's sheer perfection.

39:55.719 --> 39:56.905
I've only had it once.

39:59.806 --> 40:01.629
Listen, I don't want

40:01.892 --> 40:04.136
to stand in the way
of a great romance, okay?

40:04.478 --> 40:05.044
What do you mean?

40:05.413 --> 40:06.810
You and Tommy.

40:07.647 --> 40:09.815
I mean, clearly, opposites attract.

40:10.980 --> 40:12.332
It's an evolutionary strategy

40:12.452 --> 40:14.201
to ensure healthy reproduction.

40:14.321 --> 40:15.861
Okay. Why do you got to go
straight to breeding?

40:16.190 --> 40:17.889
All right?
With my brother?

40:18.321 --> 40:22.152
Look, I like Tommy.

40:22.556 --> 40:23.392
A lot.

40:24.260 --> 40:25.363
But I love you.

40:26.573 --> 40:27.766
And I hate it when you hate me.

40:28.019 --> 40:30.273
So I don't want to do anything
to compromise our friendship.

40:31.338 --> 40:36.024
Good, 'cause I hate it
when I have to hate you.

40:40.171 --> 40:41.824
Sip it slowly.

40:48.930 --> 40:50.000
Oh!

40:50.120 --> 40:51.550
How Much was this?

40:51.670 --> 40:53.080
$625.

40:53.118 --> 40:55.293
Did you just spit out
a '94 Chateau --

40:55.413 --> 40:57.059
De blah-blah?
Yes.

40:57.179 --> 40:59.754
My god, some smart shopper Tommy is.

40:59.874 --> 41:01.810
He wasted a month's rent

41:01.930 --> 41:06.289
on a bottle of rancid vinegar
and old garlic.

41:06.409 --> 41:06.917
No, no.

41:07.037 --> 41:09.373
It just needs to breathe
and release its tannins.

41:09.493 --> 41:10.137
Really?

41:16.292 --> 41:17.767
Eww!
Yeah.

41:17.887 --> 41:19.353
Ew.
You might be right.

41:19.473 --> 41:20.820
Mm-hmm.
Ew.

41:20.940 --> 41:23.376
What are you doing? I'm gonna
pour it back in the bottle

41:23.639 --> 41:24.869
so Tommy can take it back.

41:24.989 --> 41:26.380
They're not gonna take it back.

41:26.606 --> 41:28.803
Oh, they'll take it back.
