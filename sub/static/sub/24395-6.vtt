00:12.348 --> 00:13.847
Commander?

00:13.849 --> 00:15.215
Yes?

00:15.217 --> 00:16.483
Keep your guys back, guns down.

00:16.485 --> 00:18.185
We don't want to set him off, okay?

00:18.187 --> 00:20.287
Sure.

00:24.299 --> 00:26.126
I'm not talking to cops.

00:26.128 --> 00:27.664
No, you're not. I'm not a cop.

00:27.666 --> 00:29.196
I just sent them away, okay?

00:29.198 --> 00:31.064
Something tells me
this is about your brother A.J.

00:31.066 --> 00:33.338
Eric, tactical just confirmed

00:33.340 --> 00:34.835
his brother was a member

00:34.837 --> 00:36.377
of Hell's Infantry.

00:36.379 --> 00:37.437
Southside gang.

00:37.439 --> 00:39.639
Hey, back off. Leave.

00:39.641 --> 00:40.738
I'll blow her brains out.

00:40.740 --> 00:43.190
Why would you do that, Danny?
You got nothing against her.

00:43.191 --> 00:47.126
You don't like police.
That's... that's why I'm here.

00:47.128 --> 00:48.494
Leave, dude. I don't know how many times

00:48.496 --> 00:49.428
I'm gonna say it... leave!

00:49.430 --> 00:50.896
Thought you wanted to kill a cop.

00:50.898 --> 00:52.531
Just trust me, I'll do it, so leave.

00:52.533 --> 00:54.533
Okay, I got an I.D. on the girl.

00:54.535 --> 00:57.603
Cassie Williams.
He just picked her up randomly.

00:57.605 --> 00:59.240
This kid's improvising all the way.

00:59.242 --> 01:00.878
It's not fair, man!

01:01.342 --> 01:03.509
- They shot him for nothing!
- I know.

01:03.511 --> 01:04.977
- He was unarmed.
- He was innocent!

01:04.979 --> 01:07.213
That's it, he was unarmed,
just like Cassie there.

01:07.215 --> 01:09.148
That's... that's her name, by the way.

01:11.853 --> 01:13.886
A.J. was innocent,

01:13.888 --> 01:16.288
like Cassie. Now, you shoot her,

01:16.290 --> 01:17.623
you're just like them, wrong.

01:19.354 --> 01:20.526
They got to pay.

01:20.528 --> 01:23.360
Forget them. Think about your mom.

01:23.362 --> 01:26.265
She already lost one son.
She needs you, Danny.

01:26.267 --> 01:27.766
Let the girl go.

01:39.046 --> 01:42.214
Okay. It's okay.

01:43.985 --> 01:45.718
No, Danny.

01:45.720 --> 01:47.019
Danny, put the gun down, man.

01:47.021 --> 01:49.955
Your mother needs you now more than ever.

01:55.096 --> 01:56.996
Go ahead.

02:01.469 --> 02:03.669
Move! Come on, come on!

02:06.207 --> 02:07.653
Hey.

02:18.052 --> 02:20.085
Yeah, he was his brother.

02:22.590 --> 02:24.432
Nice work.

02:24.434 --> 02:26.025
They would have shot him, too.

02:26.027 --> 02:27.860
Feel good to get a win in your hometown?

02:27.862 --> 02:29.828
Ah, it feels good to get a win anywhere.

02:29.830 --> 02:31.630
I guess it feels good
to have you back, too.

02:31.632 --> 02:33.399
Good to be back.

02:33.401 --> 02:36.368
So, deep dish... we doing this or what?

02:36.370 --> 02:38.571
You guys want to do dinner on your own?

02:39.726 --> 02:41.774
Uh... yeah.

02:41.776 --> 02:44.396
- I think we can handle that.
- Hot date?

02:44.398 --> 02:46.478
Something like that.

02:54.283 --> 02:55.354
<i>I'm glad you were able</i>

02:55.356 --> 02:56.956
to find the time to make this happen.

02:56.958 --> 02:58.290
You know, I almost didn't.

02:58.292 --> 03:01.427
Patient came in
with two bullets in his heart.

03:01.429 --> 03:03.662
Well, I take it you took them out.

03:03.664 --> 03:06.298
I wouldn't be drinking
champagne if I didn't.

03:06.300 --> 03:07.833
No.

03:07.835 --> 03:10.302
What about you? Do you have
something to celebrate?

03:10.304 --> 03:13.706
I do, I do. I get to see you. Hi, Mom.

03:13.708 --> 03:15.207
Hi, honey.

03:17.912 --> 03:20.946
Mm, I talked to Evie yesterday.

03:20.948 --> 03:23.482
Sounds like she's doing well.

03:23.484 --> 03:25.784
- She called you?
- She misses her Gran.

03:25.786 --> 03:27.316
Yeah.

03:28.556 --> 03:29.888
Well, she misses you, too.

03:29.890 --> 03:32.324
I don't know what to do.

03:32.326 --> 03:36.028
I mean, I reach out,
and, you know, nothing.

03:36.030 --> 03:39.965
I'm just the temporary
replacement Beaumont.

03:39.967 --> 03:41.788
This'll pass.

03:44.071 --> 03:47.678
Speaking of children who
push their fathers away,

03:47.680 --> 03:50.743
I take it you don't have
any plans to visit yours?

03:54.749 --> 03:58.017
At least Evie's a teenager.
What's your excuse?

03:58.019 --> 04:00.019
- I have nothing to say to him.
- Well, sure you do.

04:00.021 --> 04:01.720
Right.

04:04.825 --> 04:07.159
Oh, I'm stuffed. Hey...

04:07.161 --> 04:09.228
who suggested we share
a slice of cheesecake?

04:09.230 --> 04:12.264
Who ordered the second piece?

04:12.266 --> 04:14.733
Only 'cause you were buying.

04:16.570 --> 04:18.570
Can you stay the weekend?

04:18.572 --> 04:21.273
Listen, I wish I could,
but I, uh, I have some things

04:21.274 --> 04:22.871
I have to take care of.

04:38.693 --> 04:39.892
Mom?

04:39.894 --> 04:42.795
- I'm fine. I'm fine.
- Okay.

04:42.797 --> 04:44.096
Are you hurt?

04:44.098 --> 04:45.764
No.

04:49.303 --> 04:51.203
All right.

05:03.252 --> 05:11.286
Synced & corrected by -robtor-

05:17.175 --> 05:19.809
Are you booked to perform
any surgeries tomorrow?

05:19.811 --> 05:22.612
Maybe you should reschedule and...

05:23.715 --> 05:25.481
Uh, Dr. Beaumont?

05:26.518 --> 05:28.251
Oh, honey, no, I'm fine.

05:28.253 --> 05:30.520
Uh, some of my patients have been

05:30.522 --> 05:32.355
waiting a long time.

05:32.357 --> 05:34.524
I'll pretend I didn't hear that.
Here you go, Mom.

05:34.526 --> 05:38.027
You don't have to fuss over me. I'm fine.

05:39.497 --> 05:42.298
This is more my speed.

05:43.535 --> 05:46.169
You should lighten up, Eric.

05:48.790 --> 05:50.306
Maxine, help yourself.

05:50.308 --> 05:52.175
I'm fine, thank you.

05:52.177 --> 05:54.277
I am so sorry that this happened.

05:54.279 --> 05:56.546
Why? You didn't pull the trigger.

05:56.548 --> 05:59.949
No, but I'm the reason that someone did.

05:59.951 --> 06:01.618
Well, you don't know that.

06:02.554 --> 06:06.322
There are 3,500 shootings
in Chicago each year.

06:06.324 --> 06:08.242
Who knows what half of them are about?

06:08.244 --> 06:10.026
Sure, maybe. But if someone's after me,

06:10.028 --> 06:12.273
I can't risk the safety
of my team or you.

06:12.275 --> 06:13.630
I need to figure out who's behind this...

06:13.632 --> 06:15.865
- Eric, you can't expect me...
- Just...

06:15.867 --> 06:18.267
Just lay low, all right?

06:18.269 --> 06:21.771
Stay in the house, keep the
doors and windows locked.

06:21.773 --> 06:22.839
Promise me.

06:22.841 --> 06:24.674
You're imprisoning me in my own home.

06:24.676 --> 06:26.909
I am ensuring you're safe, Mom.

06:26.911 --> 06:28.978
And who's making sure you're safe?

06:28.980 --> 06:30.947
That would be us.

06:32.684 --> 06:34.484
Fine.

06:34.486 --> 06:36.085
Thank you.

06:36.087 --> 06:39.555
I'm going to go relax... in my cell.

06:41.359 --> 06:43.393
I just got off the phone with Chicago PD.

06:43.395 --> 06:46.029
CCTV footage got a make and model.

06:46.031 --> 06:47.330
But not a plate?

06:47.332 --> 06:49.632
Well, neither did I,
but I did see the gun,

06:49.634 --> 06:52.153
and it kind of looked... unusual.

06:52.155 --> 06:53.269
Unusual how?

06:53.271 --> 06:54.871
It was automatic, submachine pistol,

06:54.873 --> 06:57.340
but it was, uh, short.

06:57.342 --> 07:00.743
All stock and no barrel. Stubby.

07:00.745 --> 07:02.078
This one? No.

07:02.080 --> 07:03.146
This one?

07:03.148 --> 07:04.514
No. This one?

07:04.516 --> 07:05.848
That's it. That's the one.

07:05.850 --> 07:07.850
Wow. TK 80.

07:07.852 --> 07:10.019
Not your typical street gun.

07:10.021 --> 07:11.754
It's actually perfect
for drive-bys because

07:11.756 --> 07:14.724
it's accurate, even when fired
from a high-speed vehicle.

07:14.726 --> 07:16.759
Not this time. You guys
were sitting ducks.

07:16.761 --> 07:18.661
Maybe the gunman was an amateur.

07:18.663 --> 07:20.386
- Or it was a warning shot.
- Mm.

07:20.388 --> 07:21.364
You don't think this could be

07:21.366 --> 07:23.266
- Damien Delaine, do you?
- Not a drive-by.

07:23.268 --> 07:24.784
Not Delaine's profile.

07:24.786 --> 07:26.703
Okay, the kid today, you said his brother

07:26.705 --> 07:28.438
- was a member of a gang.
- Yeah, Hell's Infantry.

07:28.440 --> 07:30.106
Well, maybe they're angry
that he got arrested.

07:30.108 --> 07:31.348
Well, they do run guns.

07:31.350 --> 07:32.709
So, maybe the kid knows someone

07:32.711 --> 07:34.243
who could own something like this.

07:34.245 --> 07:36.112
All right, let's go pay him
a little visit.

07:36.114 --> 07:37.447
Actually, you know what?

07:37.449 --> 07:40.416
I need someone to stay here,
keep an eye on my mom.

07:40.819 --> 07:41.861
It would be my pleasure.

07:41.863 --> 07:43.071
Thanks, Max.

07:43.988 --> 07:46.222
Hey, easy on the Scotch.

07:50.395 --> 07:52.462
Eric, drive-by shootings usually
don't fall under our purview.

07:52.464 --> 07:55.098
You sure you don't want
to let the cops handle this one?

07:55.100 --> 07:56.733
Ah, maybe you're right.
Let's think this through.

07:56.735 --> 07:58.601
I mean, first thing the police will do is

07:58.603 --> 08:00.670
run through hundreds
of our old work files.

08:00.672 --> 08:02.205
Then interview our staff, former clients.

08:02.207 --> 08:04.774
Could call into question
our promises of anonymity.

08:04.776 --> 08:06.509
Between you and me, that guy in Miami

08:06.511 --> 08:09.545
who paid nine mil for his show
poodles needs to be exposed.

08:09.547 --> 08:10.913
Yeah, well, best-case scenario,

08:10.915 --> 08:14.383
months from now, the police
will come up with a short list.

08:14.385 --> 08:16.686
20 to 50 of the finest felons
from across the globe

08:16.688 --> 08:19.122
that we've managed to “upset.”

08:19.124 --> 08:20.885
By that time, I'll probably be dead,

08:20.887 --> 08:22.440
you and Maxine will be running Cri/Res.

08:22.442 --> 08:24.431
- Yeah.
- On reflection, I think it's best

08:24.433 --> 08:26.996
if you and I whittle through
the list of suspects.

08:26.998 --> 08:28.765
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

08:30.568 --> 08:33.936
You know that thing you said
at the end about me and Maxine?

08:33.938 --> 08:35.238
Yeah.

08:35.240 --> 08:37.206
Didn't sound half bad.

08:37.207 --> 08:38.835
I thought you'd like that.

08:43.815 --> 08:45.633
Oh, I'm-I'm sorry.

08:46.151 --> 08:48.151
Well, no, it's okay.

08:48.153 --> 08:50.487
I was just finishing up.

08:50.489 --> 08:51.854
You meditate?

08:51.856 --> 08:54.190
Oh, 4-7-8 breathing;
helps keep me centered

08:54.192 --> 08:56.092
and relieves stress.

08:56.094 --> 08:58.194
It's especially nice
after a wee dram of Scotch.

08:59.831 --> 09:02.113
Well, you have had
quite the eventful day.

09:02.115 --> 09:04.600
I locked up all the doors and windows.

09:04.602 --> 09:05.568
You Fort Knoxed me.

09:05.570 --> 09:08.197
I certainly have.

09:08.199 --> 09:09.711
Your son's orders.

09:09.713 --> 09:10.973
Ah.

09:10.975 --> 09:13.109
Eric is very protective of me.

09:13.111 --> 09:16.846
I divorced his father when he was 13.

09:16.848 --> 09:18.481
It was messy.

09:18.483 --> 09:19.982
That must have been hard on him.

09:19.984 --> 09:21.818
He never complained, always pitched in,

09:21.820 --> 09:23.386
even did most of the cooking.

09:23.388 --> 09:24.787
Really?

09:24.789 --> 09:26.622
Kept him busy when his father moved out.

09:26.624 --> 09:29.192
So, he used cooking as therapy.

09:29.194 --> 09:31.727
Or survival. I'm a terrible cook.

09:36.309 --> 09:38.978
Is... is everything okay?

09:41.005 --> 09:42.905
Uh, I know what this is.

09:42.907 --> 09:45.208
This is just somebody
who needs a second opinion.

09:45.210 --> 09:46.709
Do you need to go to the hospital?

09:46.711 --> 09:48.911
No, I just need to look
at some imaging on my laptop.

09:48.913 --> 09:50.413
Excuse me.

09:50.415 --> 09:52.774
Annette Beaumont.

09:52.776 --> 09:54.817
Why should I help you guys?

09:54.819 --> 09:56.853
We're not asking you to rat, Danny.

09:56.855 --> 09:59.322
But Hell's Infantry run guns
in Chicago, correct?

09:59.324 --> 10:00.756
No, they don't.

10:00.758 --> 10:02.458
And I'm not even a full member,

10:02.460 --> 10:04.060
so I don't know anything about that.

10:04.062 --> 10:05.728
You're not. But if you were?

10:05.730 --> 10:07.050
But I-I don't. I'm not.

10:07.052 --> 10:08.387
Okay. I don't.

10:08.389 --> 10:10.766
Listen, I'm sorry about your brother A.J.

10:16.074 --> 10:17.809
You're sorry?

10:19.110 --> 10:20.443
Yeah, right.

10:20.445 --> 10:21.677
I know the D.A.

10:21.679 --> 10:24.146
I can make sure that
she investigates his death.

10:24.148 --> 10:25.915
You do want justice
for your brother, right?

10:25.917 --> 10:28.718
Why would I believe you?
You said there was no cops.

10:28.720 --> 10:30.186
- No, I said that...
- Yes, you did.

10:30.188 --> 10:33.389
I said that I sent them away,
and I did, to save your life.

10:33.391 --> 10:35.324
I can help you, Danny.

10:35.326 --> 10:38.251
Nah. I-I'm good.
I don't need your kind of help.

10:38.253 --> 10:39.929
I can testify on your behalf,

10:39.931 --> 10:42.146
at your sentencing,
that you gave the hostage up

10:42.171 --> 10:44.839
of your own accord and that you helped us

10:44.841 --> 10:46.440
with this other matter.

10:52.193 --> 10:54.426
- It's a TK 80.
- Ah, you know it.

10:54.428 --> 10:56.829
Who'd have a gun like that?

10:58.966 --> 11:00.768
Salazars.

11:03.104 --> 11:04.674
<i>- The</i> Salazars?
- Yeah.

11:04.676 --> 11:06.004
The crime family?

11:09.543 --> 11:10.964
Why would they want to kill me?

11:10.966 --> 11:13.281
Well, maybe they met you.

11:47.114 --> 11:48.947
You're getting weaker by the minute.

11:48.949 --> 11:50.415
If you don't get the surgery

11:50.417 --> 11:53.238
immediately, Victor, you won't survive.

11:53.240 --> 11:56.021
Doc, I killed the last guy
who called me weak.

11:56.023 --> 11:57.356
Don't worry,<i> mi amor.</i>

11:57.358 --> 12:00.392
Everything is arranged. Right?

12:00.394 --> 12:03.164
Just a few details left.

12:03.898 --> 12:06.131
Rafael, Juan.

12:14.208 --> 12:15.774
I'm so proud of you.

12:15.776 --> 12:18.877
Pop, look, the doc says we do this,

12:18.879 --> 12:21.113
you're gonna live
a long and healthy life.

12:22.444 --> 12:23.702
Rafael.

12:24.351 --> 12:27.146
I want you to know
that if I don't make it,

12:27.688 --> 12:31.890
I'll rest in peace knowing the
family will be in your hands.

12:34.395 --> 12:37.162
Juan, you always know
what to do in a crisis.

12:37.164 --> 12:39.765
You'll be Rafael's second in command.

12:44.471 --> 12:46.165
We got to go.

12:47.374 --> 12:49.608
<i>Te quiero mucho, Pa.</i>

12:54.381 --> 12:55.914
Papa.

13:09.897 --> 13:11.399
What do you know about him?

13:11.932 --> 13:13.365
Growing up in Chicago,

13:13.367 --> 13:15.367
the stories of Victor Salazar
were legendary.

13:15.369 --> 13:17.236
He buried a lot of bodies.

13:17.238 --> 13:18.870
Well, he's been in hiding

13:18.872 --> 13:20.405
for the past nine months,

13:20.407 --> 13:23.442
ever since a former member gave
the DEA evidence to arrest him.

13:23.444 --> 13:25.310
- But he's still in charge?
- Yeah, through his sons.

13:25.312 --> 13:27.112
There's four of them, right?

13:27.114 --> 13:29.915
Two are still alive, Rafael and Juan.

13:29.917 --> 13:31.416
Juan is your typical muscle,

13:31.418 --> 13:33.018
in and out of prison his whole life.

13:33.020 --> 13:34.419
Rafael went to college.

13:34.421 --> 13:36.989
- Got himself an economics degree.
- Now that's a real wise guy.

13:36.991 --> 13:39.491
Now, hang on.
Zara just sent through intel

13:39.493 --> 13:41.927
- from her Chicago PD contact.
- No.

13:41.929 --> 13:43.695
Didn't her baby doctor
put her on bed rest?

13:43.697 --> 13:45.097
She needs the distraction.

13:45.099 --> 13:46.732
One sec.

13:46.734 --> 13:48.355
This is interesting. Rumor has it,

13:48.357 --> 13:50.035
Victor has a life-threatening
heart condition.

13:50.037 --> 13:51.169
He needs two stents inserted

13:51.171 --> 13:52.971
and an aortic valve replaced,

13:52.973 --> 13:54.539
but he's too fragile

13:54.541 --> 13:56.074
for open-heart surgery.

13:57.911 --> 13:59.811
My mother is one of the few surgeons

13:59.813 --> 14:02.414
who can perform transcatheter
aortic valve implantations.

14:02.416 --> 14:05.050
It's a substitute for open-heart
surgery in high-risk patients.

14:05.052 --> 14:08.720
Which means the warning shot at
the restaurant wasn't for you.

14:09.790 --> 14:12.057
It was for my mom. Maxine.

14:12.059 --> 14:13.725
I'll get her.

14:15.269 --> 14:16.368
Annette?

14:17.965 --> 14:18.897
Annette?

14:22.069 --> 14:23.735
Annette?

14:26.460 --> 14:28.159
Hey, Annette?

14:36.776 --> 14:38.069
Maxine?

14:39.486 --> 14:42.321
Eric, she's gone.

15:00.424 --> 15:02.391
You've reached the voice mail

15:02.393 --> 15:03.692
of Dr. Annette Beaumont.

15:03.694 --> 15:05.290
- Please leave a message.
- Still straight to voice mail.

15:05.290 --> 15:06.823
No sign of struggle or forced entry.

15:06.825 --> 15:08.925
No, she left her wallet.
That is not like her.

15:08.927 --> 15:10.694
I'm sorry, Eric. I locked everything up.

15:10.696 --> 15:12.762
Hey, it's my fault.
I shouldn't have left her.

15:12.764 --> 15:14.598
I called all the numbers you gave me,

15:14.600 --> 15:15.765
including the hospitals.

15:15.767 --> 15:17.601
No one's seen her. I left messages.

15:17.603 --> 15:19.469
Oh, we know who has her. The Salazars.

15:19.471 --> 15:20.837
Let's find out where they live.

15:20.839 --> 15:22.506
Do you think the Salazars
took your mother

15:22.508 --> 15:24.007
- to operate on Victor?
- Absolutely.

15:24.009 --> 15:27.077
We don't know that for sure.
You have a better idea?

15:28.161 --> 15:30.411
Okay, so we go to their home and what?

15:30.413 --> 15:32.582
- Maybe she's there.
- And if she's not?

15:32.584 --> 15:35.051
Like you said,
bodies buried all over Chicago.

15:35.053 --> 15:36.253
Victor is in hiding.

15:36.255 --> 15:38.455
If my mother sees him,
that makes her a witness.

15:38.457 --> 15:40.790
The Salazars don't strike me
as people who like loose ends.

15:40.792 --> 15:42.192
Got a hit on their place.

15:42.194 --> 15:44.127
- Let's go.
- Eric.

15:45.731 --> 15:47.297
What's the plan again?

15:47.299 --> 15:48.965
TBD.

16:00.279 --> 16:01.378
Testing.

16:01.380 --> 16:03.613
- Testing.
- Copy, Oliver.

16:09.688 --> 16:11.121
Yes?

16:11.123 --> 16:13.657
Hello. My name is Eric Beaumont.

16:13.659 --> 16:15.692
Juan and Rafael Salazar
have taken my mother.

16:15.694 --> 16:17.761
If they don't want their home
surrounded by cops,

16:17.763 --> 16:20.597
they will talk to me.

16:30.509 --> 16:32.175
Thank you.

16:51.763 --> 16:55.465
I'm guessing they're not
a fan of pop-in visits.

16:58.722 --> 17:00.270
_

17:00.295 --> 17:01.671
Okay, we're not armed.
We're here to talk...

17:01.696 --> 17:02.882
_

17:03.257 --> 17:04.838
_

17:04.863 --> 17:06.915
I need to speak with Rafael and Juan.

17:13.986 --> 17:16.419
Definitely not fans of the pop-in.

17:16.421 --> 17:18.186
Move.

17:28.734 --> 17:30.200
Speak.

17:30.202 --> 17:32.369
I would like to see my mother,
Dr. Beaumont.

17:32.371 --> 17:33.970
Corner pocket. What was that?

17:33.972 --> 17:35.272
Which part didn't you understand?

17:35.274 --> 17:37.581
You've taken my mother.
I'd like to see her.

17:39.077 --> 17:40.610
Oh, you're mistaken.

17:40.612 --> 17:41.945
We've taken no one.

17:41.947 --> 17:43.313
So see yourselves out.

17:43.315 --> 17:45.479
Pitch and latency are inconsistent.

17:45.481 --> 17:47.117
I can't tell if he's lying.

17:47.119 --> 17:48.251
Hey, take your time.

17:48.253 --> 17:49.844
We're in no rush.

17:52.291 --> 17:54.090
You're very quiet.

17:54.092 --> 17:55.992
Rafael, nothing to add?

17:56.642 --> 17:58.895
I'd listen to my brother if I were you.

17:58.897 --> 18:00.795
He's got a short fuse.

18:02.064 --> 18:03.300
You're bad luck.

18:03.302 --> 18:06.767
Look, we only want a moment
of your time. Juan, right?

18:07.445 --> 18:10.073
I understand that you're
worried about your father.

18:10.075 --> 18:11.907
You both are.

18:12.454 --> 18:13.881
Max, that's a hot spot.

18:13.883 --> 18:16.756
- I didn't know we had company.
- Well, they're not staying.

18:16.758 --> 18:18.091
That's Carmen Salazar,

18:18.093 --> 18:19.426
Victor's latest wife.

18:19.428 --> 18:21.828
38 years old. Married six years.

18:21.830 --> 18:23.196
We're sorry to hear about

18:23.198 --> 18:25.065
your husband's heart condition, Carmen.

18:25.067 --> 18:26.933
However, you should feel confident

18:26.935 --> 18:29.202
that his odds of survival are very high

18:29.204 --> 18:31.238
with my mother performing the procedure.

18:32.011 --> 18:34.919
I don't know who you are
or what you're talking about.

18:34.921 --> 18:37.511
Victor disappeared in
Mexico nine months ago.

18:37.513 --> 18:40.244
- Yeah, we haven't heard from him.
- We're all terribly worried.

18:41.216 --> 18:43.683
Well, he may be in Mexico,

18:43.685 --> 18:45.485
but his surgeon's obviously in Chicago.

18:45.487 --> 18:47.487
I'm gonna say this one last time.

18:47.489 --> 18:48.855
We didn't take your mother.

18:48.857 --> 18:50.790
Look, I'm sorry that we couldn't be

18:50.792 --> 18:53.760
of any more help, Mr. Beaumont.

18:53.762 --> 18:55.195
Before we leave,

18:55.197 --> 18:58.131
I need to know that
she's gonna be safely returned.

19:08.043 --> 19:10.243
You know, if your mother
is as good a surgeon

19:10.245 --> 19:13.113
as you say she is,
I'm sure you'll see her again.

19:13.115 --> 19:15.448
Clear voice, eye contact.

19:15.450 --> 19:17.183
I think he's telling the truth.

19:20.189 --> 19:23.023
Oh, I would answer that if I were you.

19:31.266 --> 19:32.899
Hello?

19:32.901 --> 19:35.468
- Eric. Hello?
- Mom.

19:35.470 --> 19:36.570
Eric, stay out of this.

19:36.572 --> 19:38.550
- Mom, where are you?
- I'm fine.

19:38.552 --> 19:40.740
Don't worry about me. I can handle this.

19:40.742 --> 19:42.709
They are members of
a major drug syndicate.

19:42.711 --> 19:44.878
You can't trust anything they say.

19:44.880 --> 19:46.313
It's just another operation.

19:46.315 --> 19:47.759
Really? And after?

19:47.761 --> 19:50.217
After? We'll have dinner.

20:06.341 --> 20:07.699
You do anything to my mother...

20:07.701 --> 20:09.496
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

20:09.521 --> 20:11.421
- What are you gonna do?
- Nothing.

20:11.423 --> 20:13.123
You let her go after the surgery,

20:13.125 --> 20:15.531
and we'll do exactly that, nothing.

20:16.121 --> 20:17.754
We were just leaving.

20:19.452 --> 20:20.697
Sure.

20:33.566 --> 20:36.400
My mother's not trying
to save Victor's life,

20:36.425 --> 20:38.191
she's trying to save mine.

20:38.216 --> 20:41.527
So they... so they shot
at you to get her to cave.

20:41.552 --> 20:43.309
And now she is caving.

20:43.334 --> 20:44.499
Well, maybe she's right, Eric.

20:44.524 --> 20:46.604
She'll do the operation
and they'll let her go.

20:46.926 --> 20:48.125
You expect me to trust

20:48.127 --> 20:50.193
one of the most notorious
crime families in Chicago?

20:50.195 --> 20:51.361
I don't think so.

20:51.363 --> 20:54.197
What if Victor Salazar dies?

20:58.170 --> 21:00.370
I think Carmen might be having an affair.

21:00.784 --> 21:01.959
How do you figure that?

21:01.961 --> 21:03.512
Well, she was drinking cranberry juice.

21:03.514 --> 21:05.366
Yeah, probably with
a splash of vodka in it.

21:05.368 --> 21:08.145
No, like, pure cranberry juice,

21:08.147 --> 21:09.913
like to treat, um, a UTI.

21:09.915 --> 21:11.824
You know, a-a urinary tract infection.

21:11.824 --> 21:13.523
I know what a UTI is.

21:13.525 --> 21:14.624
Okay, well, it's common when you start

21:14.626 --> 21:15.792
having sex with somebody new.

21:15.794 --> 21:17.994
Pure cranberry juice is
a common cure for it.

21:17.996 --> 21:19.696
Where do we think
they're doing the surgery?

21:19.698 --> 21:20.997
Maybe your mother's hospital?

21:20.999 --> 21:23.284
No. There's no way those two
are letting their father

21:23.286 --> 21:24.444
enter a hospital.
The FBI would be all over it.

21:24.446 --> 21:25.610
Well, if it's offsite,

21:25.612 --> 21:26.880
they would need
special medical equipment.

21:26.882 --> 21:28.038
And medication.

21:28.040 --> 21:29.372
Maybe that's the way to track them down.

21:29.374 --> 21:31.308
We need an expert, someone who would know

21:31.310 --> 21:33.577
where they might've
sourced stuff like that.

21:34.360 --> 21:36.146
- I know someone.
- Who?

21:39.751 --> 21:41.325
Don't ask.

22:13.566 --> 22:15.018
Eric.

22:16.277 --> 22:17.721
Hey, Dad.

22:17.723 --> 22:19.956
Uh...

22:34.869 --> 22:36.102
<i>If you ask me,</i>

22:36.104 --> 22:37.336
you need to call the cops.

22:37.338 --> 22:39.939
Yeah, I didn't come here
for a second opinion.

22:39.941 --> 22:41.807
Your mother's life is at risk.

22:41.809 --> 22:43.862
Thank you. Now let's get to the point.

22:43.864 --> 22:45.911
I need to know who bought the
equipment needed to perform

22:45.913 --> 22:49.215
a TAVI procedure, and where
they had it shipped, that's all.

22:49.217 --> 22:51.617
Yeah, I haven't been
a surgeon for two years.

22:51.619 --> 22:53.052
You still have your contacts.

23:00.995 --> 23:02.280
Since when do you bake?

23:02.282 --> 23:06.332
Oh, one of the, uh, grandkids
has a cookie sale tomorrow.

23:09.070 --> 23:10.622
Look...

23:11.906 --> 23:13.939
I know I wasn't the greatest dad,

23:13.941 --> 23:16.253
especially after the divorce.

23:17.250 --> 23:20.179
But I've been reaching out
for a long time now.

23:20.181 --> 23:21.814
Always to no response.

23:21.816 --> 23:23.616
Well, you were never interested
in hanging out with me then.

23:23.618 --> 23:25.484
- Why start now?
- That's not fair.

23:25.486 --> 23:26.886
Fair? Really?

23:27.755 --> 23:29.850
You cheated on Mom, you abandoned us.

23:31.192 --> 23:33.392
I don't want to see you,
I don't want to talk to you,

23:33.394 --> 23:34.527
I don't even want to be here.

23:34.529 --> 23:36.275
Hey, you're free to go.

23:36.277 --> 23:37.963
I need your help to save Mom's life.

23:37.965 --> 23:39.265
Can you, can you do that?

23:39.267 --> 23:41.000
Can you, can you help her, for once?

23:41.002 --> 23:44.236
Well, wouldn't be the first time.

23:44.238 --> 23:45.638
I'm sorry, what?

23:45.640 --> 23:48.641
You know, what happened was <i> our</i> fault,

23:48.643 --> 23:50.209
mine and your mother's.

23:50.211 --> 23:52.511
Mom's fault? That's... oh, that's rich.

23:52.513 --> 23:54.380
Oh, you think you know
everything, but you don't.

23:54.382 --> 23:56.081
I wasn't the only one who made a mistake.

23:56.083 --> 23:57.383
She didn't destroy our family.

23:57.385 --> 23:59.084
Your mother had an affair.

23:59.713 --> 24:01.153
And it wasn't just an affair.

24:01.155 --> 24:03.389
She fell in love. You remember Dr. Katz?

24:03.391 --> 24:05.257
He used to come over for dinner here?

24:05.259 --> 24:07.990
I only found out about it
after he ended it

24:07.992 --> 24:11.141
and she became depressed.

24:14.395 --> 24:15.935
That isn't true.

24:16.897 --> 24:20.940
I... said that I would forgive
her, and I tried, I did.

24:21.819 --> 24:24.376
But it's easier said than done.

24:24.378 --> 24:26.448
And once she did it, I did it.

24:27.048 --> 24:29.118
I had my fling, and...

24:30.418 --> 24:33.419
then things fell apart.

24:34.206 --> 24:36.222
I'm...

24:36.224 --> 24:37.584
I'm sorry.

24:40.003 --> 24:41.594
She did it first?

24:42.631 --> 24:44.967
That's not my point.

24:46.009 --> 24:47.499
We were both wrong.

24:48.554 --> 24:50.035
Why didn't you tell me?

24:50.037 --> 24:51.470
We didn't want you to hate both of us.

24:51.472 --> 24:52.571
But it was the truth.

24:52.573 --> 24:54.101
Yeah, well...

24:54.642 --> 24:58.188
sometimes there's too much truth
in this world...

24:59.080 --> 25:01.442
and not enough understanding.

25:12.578 --> 25:14.393
Yes, hello. This is Phillip.

25:14.788 --> 25:17.096
May I speak with Dr. Fletcher, please?

25:36.543 --> 25:38.543
How much longer till you're ready?

25:38.953 --> 25:40.856
She's stalling.

25:41.422 --> 25:44.657
Get me a proper surgical team,
and it'll go quicker.

25:44.659 --> 25:46.105
He should be in a hospital.

25:46.107 --> 25:48.160
You already said that. Repeatedly.

25:48.162 --> 25:51.051
I can't vouch for
the sterility of this place.

25:51.053 --> 25:52.364
Why don't you

25:52.366 --> 25:53.766
quit your bitching,

25:53.768 --> 25:54.863
and get on with it?

25:54.865 --> 25:58.126
Do you want it done fast,
or do you want it done right?

25:58.128 --> 26:02.441
No, we want it done right,
because if my father dies,

26:02.443 --> 26:04.376
so will your son.

26:06.213 --> 26:09.281
All right. Understood.

26:14.155 --> 26:16.655
Okay. Ready. Go ahead.

26:16.657 --> 26:18.390
My father called his contacts

26:18.392 --> 26:20.526
in the medical supply business.
Equipment for this type

26:20.528 --> 26:25.130
of surgery was shipped to a GP,
a Dr. Dahlstrom, two days ago.

26:25.132 --> 26:26.932
I'm gonna send it over to you,

26:26.934 --> 26:30.069
but the address is
2765 South Columbus Drive.

26:30.071 --> 26:31.704
Got it. We're on our way.

26:32.449 --> 26:34.306
You know...

26:34.308 --> 26:37.910
there-there is something
odd on that list.

26:42.350 --> 26:44.903
Dr. Dahlstrom?

26:45.413 --> 26:46.685
Yes?

26:46.687 --> 26:50.422
Oliver Yates, Maxine Carlson,
Crisis Resolution.

26:50.424 --> 26:52.881
Can you explain why a family doctor

26:52.883 --> 26:55.194
such as yourself is in need
of equipment to perform

26:55.196 --> 26:57.735
a transcatheter
aortic valve implantation?

26:57.737 --> 26:59.182
I don't know what you're talking about.

26:59.184 --> 27:01.803
Really? You don't recall equipment

27:01.805 --> 27:03.778
showing up at your clinic two days ago?

27:03.780 --> 27:05.904
No. Must be a mistake.

27:05.906 --> 27:08.652
Sorry, Dr. Dahlstrom, but you're lying.

27:10.345 --> 27:12.258
How much are the Salazars paying you?

27:12.260 --> 27:13.879
You got the wrong guy.

27:13.881 --> 27:15.647
Just tell us where they're operating

27:15.649 --> 27:17.149
on Victor Salazar.

27:17.151 --> 27:20.085
A surgeon, a doctor just like you,

27:20.087 --> 27:21.687
is being forced to operate.

27:21.689 --> 27:23.722
They're threatening to kill her son.

27:23.724 --> 27:25.491
I still don't know
what you're talking about.

27:25.493 --> 27:26.959
Or we could call the FBI,

27:26.961 --> 27:29.128
- have them ask you.
- Mm-hmm.

27:29.130 --> 27:32.297
They're dying to know
where Victor Salazar is.

27:32.299 --> 27:35.434
Of course, then his sons would be angry.

27:39.507 --> 27:40.973
<i>Well, this is</i>

27:40.975 --> 27:43.509
all the right equipment your mom
needs to perform the surgery,

27:43.511 --> 27:45.244
along with all the right meds.

27:45.246 --> 27:46.440
But?

27:47.691 --> 27:49.467
Who ordered these two drugs?

27:49.943 --> 27:52.050
See, at low doses,
potassium chloride is used

27:52.052 --> 27:53.952
to treat an electrolyte imbalance.

27:53.954 --> 27:57.790
But it's also found in lethal
injections used in executions.

27:57.792 --> 27:59.068
And digoxin is used

27:59.070 --> 28:00.959
to treat arrhythmia, but in someone

28:00.961 --> 28:02.461
with a more serious cardiac history...

28:02.463 --> 28:05.664
So neither of these are needed
in Victor's surgery?

28:05.666 --> 28:07.566
Either can induce heart failure.

28:07.568 --> 28:11.125
And taken together... I don't get it.

28:11.127 --> 28:13.884
I thought they were trying
to save their father's life.

28:17.611 --> 28:18.944
Yeah.

28:18.946 --> 28:21.113
Got a location for the surgery site.

28:21.115 --> 28:23.015
Okay, good. You guys head there now.

28:23.017 --> 28:24.316
Where are you going?

28:24.318 --> 28:25.851
I got to pick up

28:25.853 --> 28:27.519
some cranberry juice.

28:41.535 --> 28:43.936
It's good to see you again, Mrs. Salazar.

28:43.938 --> 28:45.938
Wish I could say the same.

28:45.940 --> 28:47.706
Juan and Rafael aren't here, so...

28:47.708 --> 28:48.907
Oh, that-that's perfect.

28:48.909 --> 28:50.464
I came to see you.

28:50.466 --> 28:53.045
You should know that someone is
trying to kill your husband.

28:53.047 --> 28:56.189
Many people want to kill Victor:

28:56.191 --> 28:59.106
police, rivals, his first wife.

28:59.108 --> 29:00.619
One of his sons?

29:01.390 --> 29:03.789
Juan and Rafael are devoted
to their father.

29:03.791 --> 29:04.957
And how do they feel about you?

29:04.959 --> 29:08.694
You grew up poor in
Jacksonville, family struggled.

29:08.696 --> 29:10.562
Now look at you. I mean, you're...

29:10.564 --> 29:12.030
living in the lap of luxury.

29:12.032 --> 29:14.099
What is your point, Mr. Beaumont?

29:14.101 --> 29:15.934
Well, if Victor dies,
one of the sons takes over.

29:15.936 --> 29:17.272
Where does that leave you?

29:17.274 --> 29:18.971
That is none of your concern.

29:18.973 --> 29:20.072
But it is yours.

29:20.074 --> 29:21.991
I mean, this family
is all about bloodlines.

29:21.993 --> 29:24.283
You don't really want to rely
on their generosity, do you?

29:24.285 --> 29:27.413
- I will be fine, thanks.
- You're having an affair.

29:27.415 --> 29:29.835
Is it Juan or Rafael?

29:30.518 --> 29:32.592
One of them ordered drugs to kill Victor.

29:32.594 --> 29:34.253
You don't want to be
responsible for his death,

29:34.255 --> 29:35.888
now, do you?

29:36.633 --> 29:38.357
I love my husband.

29:38.359 --> 29:39.594
Then help me save him.

29:41.138 --> 29:44.463
Who ordered these medical supplies?

29:45.183 --> 29:47.399
Look, I don't care
about what you're doing.

29:47.401 --> 29:49.434
I just want to save my mother.

29:59.156 --> 30:03.061
Juan has always been
jealous of his brother.

30:03.086 --> 30:04.576
Juan.

30:06.153 --> 30:07.781
Then I better stop him.

30:07.783 --> 30:10.036
Victor means everything to me.

30:10.038 --> 30:11.918
Of course he does.

30:16.864 --> 30:18.697
<i>So this, uh,</i>

30:18.699 --> 30:20.365
cranberry juice.

30:20.969 --> 30:25.437
You ever, you know, for the, uh...

30:25.439 --> 30:26.905
Maybe.

30:26.907 --> 30:29.675
- Like, a recently, maybe?
- What are you getting at?

30:29.677 --> 30:31.188
Nothing, just...

30:32.146 --> 30:35.147
uh, asking about, you know,
your romantic situation.

30:35.149 --> 30:37.149
How's Maisie?

30:37.151 --> 30:38.550
Well, Maisie,

30:38.552 --> 30:40.752
that... that didn't end well.

30:41.198 --> 30:43.188
Oh. Sorry.

30:43.190 --> 30:44.323
No, it's fine.

30:44.325 --> 30:47.359
Just, uh, you know, wasn't meant to be.

30:47.753 --> 30:49.653
Yeah? How come?

30:51.031 --> 30:54.700
I think she sensed
that there was someone else.

30:54.702 --> 30:57.603
Um, is there?

30:57.605 --> 30:59.104
- Is there what?
- Someone else.

31:01.342 --> 31:03.178
Well, it's too early to tell.

31:04.596 --> 31:06.278
Is that right?

31:08.849 --> 31:10.462
Hey. Uh, go ahead, Eric.

31:10.464 --> 31:11.895
Got eyes on the warehouse?

31:11.920 --> 31:13.785
- Yeah, we do.
- One of the brothers is

31:13.787 --> 31:15.988
about to get a call from Carmen;
I need to know which one,

31:15.990 --> 31:18.557
because he's arranging for
Victor to die during surgery.

31:18.559 --> 31:20.826
I don't get it.
Why go through all this trouble?

31:20.828 --> 31:22.127
Why not just kill Victor?

31:22.129 --> 31:23.161
Yeah, and then the sons could take over.

31:23.163 --> 31:24.262
Well, because only one of the brothers

31:24.264 --> 31:25.925
is behind this; this is a power struggle.

31:25.927 --> 31:28.133
Right, and the one brother
has to hide the murder

31:28.135 --> 31:30.168
- from the other sibling.
- Yeah, but which one?

31:30.170 --> 31:33.905
Well, which brother did Carmen call?

31:37.011 --> 31:39.111
Well, looks like it's college boy.

31:39.113 --> 31:40.779
Rafael.

31:40.781 --> 31:42.714
She told me it was Juan.

31:42.716 --> 31:45.450
So she's either calling Rafael
to tell him to stop his brother

31:45.452 --> 31:49.223
or she is in on it with Rafael
and she's warning him.

31:49.225 --> 31:50.790
So you think she's having
the affair with Rafael?

31:50.792 --> 31:52.457
That's what we need to confirm.

31:52.459 --> 31:54.037
I'm on my way.

32:09.243 --> 32:11.276
Procedure was a success.

32:11.278 --> 32:14.713
- He should be up and moving tomorrow.
- So it's done?

32:14.715 --> 32:16.782
I just need to seal the
femoral artery puncture.

32:16.784 --> 32:19.584
Dr. Beaumont.

32:21.088 --> 32:23.455
Pressure is dropping. 90/60.

32:23.457 --> 32:25.290
That doesn't make sense.

32:25.292 --> 32:27.793
Still dropping. 80/50.

32:28.996 --> 32:30.996
What's that noise?

32:30.998 --> 32:33.265
If he dies, so do you.

32:39.294 --> 32:40.354
Come on. Yeah.

32:40.354 --> 32:42.388
Epinephrine. Got it. 70/45.

32:42.390 --> 32:45.090
Vasopressin 42 units.

32:45.092 --> 32:46.892
This shouldn't be happening.
It doesn't make sense.

32:46.894 --> 32:48.527
Yeah, so fix it!

32:48.529 --> 32:49.975
What's going on?

32:49.977 --> 32:51.497
- It's Pop. He's dying.
- What did she do?

32:51.499 --> 32:54.133
I did everything right.
There's another issue here.

32:54.135 --> 32:55.568
- Yeah, what is it?
- Do something!

32:55.570 --> 32:57.303
He's going into V-tach.

32:57.305 --> 32:59.085
Prepare to defibrillate.

33:00.948 --> 33:02.514
Coming in.

33:05.002 --> 33:06.645
Pushing epi.

33:06.967 --> 33:08.734
Still in V-fib.

33:17.024 --> 33:19.425
I haven't seen your mother yet.
She must still be inside.

33:19.427 --> 33:20.593
Something is happening, though.

33:20.595 --> 33:22.394
Rafael and some guards just ran back in.

33:22.396 --> 33:24.430
Probably means the drugs are
working and Victor's dying.

33:25.236 --> 33:27.600
Hey, hey. I got this. She's my mother.

33:27.602 --> 33:30.569
Exactly. That's why you're
not going in there alone.

33:30.571 --> 33:32.071
All right, let's go.

33:34.976 --> 33:36.308
Charge. 300 joules.

33:36.310 --> 33:37.552
300. Clear?

33:37.554 --> 33:38.811
- Clear.
- Clear.

33:39.513 --> 33:40.746
Still in V-fib.

33:40.748 --> 33:42.414
- 360.
- 360. Clear?

33:42.416 --> 33:43.749
- Clear.
- Clear.

33:43.751 --> 33:45.150
- Mom, Mom! Stop.
- Hey!

33:45.152 --> 33:46.919
- Eric.
- Get out!

33:46.921 --> 33:49.154
Someone gave Victor
potassium chloride and digoxin.

33:49.156 --> 33:51.290
What? How?

33:51.292 --> 33:52.591
I don't...

33:53.560 --> 33:55.828
Someone contaminated the saline.

33:55.830 --> 33:57.930
Fresh bag. Fast.

33:57.932 --> 33:59.958
- Don't touch him.
- Not another step!

33:59.960 --> 34:01.868
These drugs will kill him.

34:01.870 --> 34:04.270
If she doesn't help him,
your father's gonna die.

34:04.272 --> 34:05.887
But that's what one of you wants.

34:05.889 --> 34:08.806
Who ordered the drugs for the
surgery? Was it you, Juan?

34:08.809 --> 34:10.799
- What are you talking about?
- Eyes aren't darting or blinking.

34:10.801 --> 34:12.518
Looks more confused than culpable.

34:12.520 --> 34:13.712
Doubt it's Juan.

34:14.344 --> 34:17.382
Okay. I'm gonna... I'm gonna
pull a list of drugs

34:17.385 --> 34:18.889
that were ordered out of my pocket.

34:18.891 --> 34:21.353
Two of them,
potassium chloride and digoxin,

34:21.355 --> 34:23.022
actually induce heart failure.

34:23.024 --> 34:24.714
That's exactly
what's happening right now.

34:24.716 --> 34:27.893
But I won't help your
father if you kill my son.

34:27.895 --> 34:28.893
So who spiked your father's meds

34:28.896 --> 34:30.155
with something that could kill him?

34:30.804 --> 34:33.666
He's a liar, Juan. Shoot him.

34:33.668 --> 34:34.833
Looks like it's Rafael.

34:34.835 --> 34:35.868
What did you do?

34:35.870 --> 34:36.902
You better calm him

34:36.904 --> 34:38.637
before he starts firing.

34:38.639 --> 34:40.139
All right, let's-let's...
let's talk this through, okay?

34:40.141 --> 34:41.172
It's a trick.

34:41.175 --> 34:42.605
She did it.

34:46.047 --> 34:48.213
Why? Why?!

34:48.612 --> 34:51.850
Because Rafael wants
to murder your father

34:52.364 --> 34:54.553
and disguise it as an operation gone bad

34:54.554 --> 34:56.455
so he can be with Carmen.

34:56.456 --> 34:57.823
That's crazy.

34:57.825 --> 35:00.125
If I'm going to save your
father, it needs to be now.

35:00.127 --> 35:01.860
You'll do nothing.

35:01.862 --> 35:03.228
No, wait!

35:07.401 --> 35:09.635
Whoa, whoa, whoa, no.

35:09.637 --> 35:11.945
No, don't. You want your father to live?

35:12.527 --> 35:14.053
You let your brother live.

35:15.076 --> 35:16.375
Let Rafael and Carmen go safely,

35:16.377 --> 35:17.943
and my mother will save your father.

35:17.945 --> 35:20.746
- Doesn't deserve it.
- Do it for your dad.

35:24.887 --> 35:26.027
You go.

35:26.029 --> 35:27.353
I don't ever want to see

35:27.355 --> 35:30.889
your face in this country again,
'cause you are dead

35:30.891 --> 35:33.406
to this family. You understand me?

35:37.031 --> 35:40.107
Please. Please, save my dad.

35:40.109 --> 35:43.227
Don't worry. Keep pressure on his wound.

35:43.229 --> 35:46.271
Run a fresh line. Flush it.

35:50.713 --> 35:52.177
An amp of bicarb.

36:09.063 --> 36:11.230
- What's that?
- He's got a pulse.

36:12.500 --> 36:13.966
BP is rising.

36:13.968 --> 36:16.935
80/50. 90/60.

36:16.937 --> 36:18.537
He's stabilizing.

36:19.202 --> 36:21.120
And now to treat the brother.

36:27.048 --> 36:29.048
Yeah. Well, good work.

36:34.467 --> 36:36.422
If the cops ever find out
where my father is...

36:36.424 --> 36:39.472
Okay, this never happened.

36:40.361 --> 36:41.894
<i>Gracias.</i>

36:41.896 --> 36:45.264
Damn, you Beaumonts like to stir it up.

36:45.979 --> 36:47.599
You did great in there.

36:47.601 --> 36:51.401
Thanks, Yates. I was terrified.

36:55.145 --> 36:57.983
You should've told me what happened.

37:00.915 --> 37:02.448
I was trying

37:02.450 --> 37:03.916
to protect you.

37:03.918 --> 37:05.748
Maybe it's time to stop.

37:06.821 --> 37:08.387
Dad told me about what happened.

37:08.389 --> 37:10.271
You spoke to your father?

37:11.437 --> 37:12.858
He told me everything.

37:12.860 --> 37:14.159
Everything?

37:16.030 --> 37:17.896
About the affair?

37:17.898 --> 37:19.965
Oh, Eric, I'm sorry.

37:19.967 --> 37:21.500
I should've told you years ago.

37:21.502 --> 37:24.303
Yeah. Yeah, you should have.

37:24.305 --> 37:27.476
You said it yourself, I pushed
him away for most of my life.

37:27.478 --> 37:29.441
Well, I tried to convince you
to go see him.

37:29.443 --> 37:31.176
You could've seen him at any time.

37:31.178 --> 37:33.818
No, not without knowing the truth, Mom.

37:35.528 --> 37:39.718
Well, I guess your mother's
not perfect after all.

37:41.288 --> 37:43.555
It's kind of a relief.

37:58.572 --> 38:01.596
Rafael and Carmen have a lot of secrets.

38:02.209 --> 38:03.709
Made a big, ol' mess.

38:03.711 --> 38:06.278
Actually got me thinking about
our conversation before.

38:06.280 --> 38:07.946
Maybe actually should...

38:07.948 --> 38:09.896
Uh, that was...

38:10.851 --> 38:12.951
that was really intense in there.

38:13.399 --> 38:14.520
Yeah.

38:18.092 --> 38:19.489
You know...

38:21.061 --> 38:26.064
I look at Eric and
I wonder how he handles it.

38:26.329 --> 38:30.969
His-his mom in danger, Evie, Nathalie.

38:30.971 --> 38:32.237
I don't know if I could cope...

38:32.239 --> 38:34.473
“What's she like, Oliver”"
What, Max? Sorry?

38:34.475 --> 38:35.774
My secret crush?

38:35.776 --> 38:38.043
Oh, so happy you asked.

38:38.045 --> 38:41.380
Well, she's smart

38:41.382 --> 38:44.850
and funny and super chill,

38:44.852 --> 38:48.187
and she looks great in a pair of jeans

38:48.189 --> 38:50.455
and curses like a sailor.

38:50.457 --> 38:52.397
She's basically the whole package.

38:53.856 --> 38:55.775
But most importantly...

38:57.097 --> 38:58.736
...she's kind...

38:59.821 --> 39:01.366
and generous.

39:02.115 --> 39:06.038
And she makes it really hard
for me to do my job,

39:06.040 --> 39:08.807
because I can't take my eyes off her.

39:11.011 --> 39:15.380
We've been dancing
around this for months.

39:17.151 --> 39:18.617
After today, I...

39:30.231 --> 39:31.563
Hi, Eric.

39:31.565 --> 39:33.265
Hey, Max. I'd like to debrief right away.

39:33.267 --> 39:34.766
Are you close?

39:34.768 --> 39:36.635
Pretty close. Yeah.

39:36.637 --> 39:38.192
Have you seen Oliver?

39:38.906 --> 39:40.838
I could probably find him.

39:40.840 --> 39:42.441
Okay, meet me in the lobby in 45.

39:42.443 --> 39:43.408
We'll talk over dinner.

39:43.410 --> 39:45.875
- I'm buying.
- Great. See you then.

39:46.806 --> 39:48.680
Does he have a camera in here?

39:48.682 --> 39:50.993
Can he hear us? Can he see us?

39:50.995 --> 39:54.786
Oh.

39:56.890 --> 39:59.925
We could never hide this from him.

40:35.262 --> 40:37.126
Eric.

40:37.798 --> 40:39.197
Your mom, is she...?

40:39.199 --> 40:40.632
She's okay.

40:41.297 --> 40:42.334
Thank you.

40:43.935 --> 40:45.899
She says to thank you, too.

40:45.901 --> 40:49.141
I was just watching the game.
Did you want to come in?

40:50.978 --> 40:52.678
Dad, I've been thinking, maybe...

40:52.680 --> 40:54.352
I don't need you to forgive me.

40:55.082 --> 40:58.517
I'd settle for you just
letting me back into your life.

41:02.008 --> 41:03.808
Who's playing?

41:09.630 --> 41:11.619
You want a beer?

41:12.099 --> 41:14.232
You got any of those cookies left?
