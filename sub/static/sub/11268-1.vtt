     Cheers <i>is filmed before</i>    
     <i>a live studio audience.</i>    

00:04.604 --> 00:06.205
Quite a night,                  
huh, Norm?                      

00:06.272 --> 00:08.640
                        Yep.    
    Yeah.                       

00:08.708 --> 00:12.077
        I can't believe         
  old Sammy wants to be a dad.  

00:12.178 --> 00:14.213
              Yep.              

00:14.280 --> 00:16.548
  He's got to be real careful   
    about choosing a mother.    

00:16.649 --> 00:18.817
A lot of things                 
to consider.                    

00:18.885 --> 00:21.387
Like, for example,              
how the genes match up.         

00:21.488 --> 00:23.155
Yeah.                           

00:23.223 --> 00:26.759
 Wish my parents had given that 
a little bit more thought.      

00:26.826 --> 00:28.861
Yeah.                           

00:28.928 --> 00:31.263
    Maybe I'd be able           
    to jump a little higher,    

00:31.331 --> 00:32.598
      run a little faster.      

00:34.601 --> 00:37.069
You know, there's               
a jumping gene in my ma.        

00:37.137 --> 00:39.605
It's called the "J" gene.       

00:39.673 --> 00:41.273
    It's... it's recessive.     

00:41.341 --> 00:42.541
You know, so, if                

00:42.609 --> 00:44.309
  my ma had gotten matched up   

00:44.377 --> 00:47.680
        with a guy              
with a dominant jumping gene... 

00:47.747 --> 00:50.015
You know, let's see.            

00:50.083 --> 00:52.584
    Like, uh... Carl Lewis.     

00:55.422 --> 00:56.755
     I'm telling you, Norm,     

00:56.823 --> 00:58.323
    it could have been          
  a whole different playground  

00:58.391 --> 01:00.626
for little Cliffie Lewis.       

01:00.694 --> 01:03.962
 Cliffie, I hate to interrupt,  
      but, uh, we're here.      

01:05.632 --> 01:07.066
Normie, how come                

01:07.133 --> 01:09.401
you always drop me off at least 
 six blocks away from my house? 

01:09.469 --> 01:10.703
  Well, this time it's a mile.  

01:12.539 --> 01:14.106
            Get out.

No more "Rebecca the jerk."

No more "Rebecca the goonball."

     "Rebecca the mother"!      

02:37.891 --> 02:39.892
    I'm going to have           
    a brand-new human baby!     

02:41.561 --> 02:43.896
         I can't wait!          

02:43.963 --> 02:45.931
     You know, a new life!      

02:45.999 --> 02:49.134

02:58.144 --> 03:00.279
      Can you believe it?       
    I forgot my coat.           

03:00.347 --> 03:03.649
Oh, I'm just so                 
excited about this!             

03:03.717 --> 03:07.486
         I don't know.          
    I'm going to be a mommy!

                 Rebecca, honey?
                          Honey?

03:10.824 --> 03:11.957
What, Sam?                      

03:12.025 --> 03:13.225
             Are you sure you're
                 ready for this?

03:13.293 --> 03:14.727
Well, don't I                   
look ready?                     

03:14.794 --> 03:17.463
            Maybe I'm thrown off
                by the coatrack.

03:17.530 --> 03:19.031
Oh, I hate it                   
when I do that.                 
            Careful, careful.   

03:19.099 --> 03:21.133
Well, you think                 
we're ready, don't you?         

03:21.201 --> 03:22.801
I mean, you don't               
think that we're                
rushing this, do you?           

03:22.869 --> 03:24.536
Do you need a little time       
to think it over?               

03:24.604 --> 03:26.271
No... sweetheart, sweetheart,   
        come on, turn around.   

03:26.339 --> 03:28.440
    I think we're both          
     very excited by this.      

03:28.508 --> 03:30.309
 You want to be a mommy, right? 

03:30.377 --> 03:31.977
And I want to be a daddy.       

03:32.045 --> 03:33.846
I think that the decision       
      has been made here.       

03:33.913 --> 03:35.180
Sam, just give it a yank.       

03:35.248 --> 03:37.316
            Ow! Ooh!            

03:37.384 --> 03:39.918
Are you hurt?                   

03:39.986 --> 03:42.221
            No, no. I'm fine.   

03:42.288 --> 03:43.922
Okay, what do you think?        

03:43.990 --> 03:45.224
You want to give it             
till tomorrow?                  

03:45.291 --> 03:46.625
                (high voice):   
                         Please.

03:51.931 --> 03:54.299
  Hey, everybody, guess what.   

03:54.367 --> 03:56.969
My buddy just                   
bowled a 300!                   

03:57.037 --> 03:59.371
                     Great. Like
             anybody cares, huh?

03:59.439 --> 04:00.973
A round of drinks on me!        

04:01.041 --> 04:02.274
     All right! Way to roll     

04:02.342 --> 04:03.308
              that melon, buddy!

There you go.                   

04:05.045 --> 04:07.479
        Here you go, bud.       

04:07.547 --> 04:09.114
            Oh, sorry, missy.   

04:09.182 --> 04:11.717
What for? You think             
I won't enjoy a cigar           

04:11.785 --> 04:13.385
because I'm a woman?            

04:13.453 --> 04:16.488
I'll save it for the            
George Sand Film Festival.      

04:16.555 --> 04:18.457
      (Frasier chuckling)       

04:18.524 --> 04:20.059
         You see, what          
      you don't understand      

04:20.125 --> 04:21.326
is that my wife                 
just made a...                  

04:21.394 --> 04:23.896
a very funny                    
literary reference              

04:23.963 --> 04:25.431
to a woman that                 

04:25.498 --> 04:28.434
used to dress as a man,         
and lived in France.            

04:28.501 --> 04:29.668
                Was he a bowler?

04:29.736 --> 04:33.739
Sure. What the hell?            

04:33.807 --> 04:36.875
Hey, uh... why don't            
you have the, uh...             

04:36.943 --> 04:38.510
              smokers sitting in
            the smoking section?

04:38.578 --> 04:41.447
                  Oh, of course.
                Where's my head?

04:41.514 --> 04:42.915
 Probably in the pumpkin patch  

04:43.049 --> 04:45.184
         wondering when         
      the mix-up occurred.      

04:47.354 --> 04:49.421
                  Sammy, we have
              a smoking section?

04:49.489 --> 04:50.956
    Yeah. Over by the piano.    

04:51.024 --> 04:53.258
                We have a piano?

04:57.097 --> 05:00.366
 Oh. I gotta turn my head more. 

05:06.539 --> 05:07.606
            Hi, Sam.            

05:07.674 --> 05:10.242
  Hi. Sorry about last night.   

05:10.310 --> 05:11.410
Oh, no. Don't                   
worry about it.                 

05:11.478 --> 05:12.644
You feeling better?             

05:12.712 --> 05:14.013
You didn't                      
bruise, did you?                

05:14.080 --> 05:16.415
                     Sweetheart,
            it's not a peach.   

05:16.483 --> 05:18.050
                    So...       

05:18.118 --> 05:19.785
                you, uh... still
             want to be a mommy?

05:19.853 --> 05:21.420
Do you still                    
want to be a daddy?             

05:21.488 --> 05:22.588
                I do if you do. 

05:22.655 --> 05:23.922
        I do.                   

05:23.990 --> 05:25.090
        Great. All right. Great.

05:25.158 --> 05:26.225
                 I'll... I'll be
                     right back.

05:26.292 --> 05:27.559
Hold it. Hold it.               
Wait. Wait.                     

05:27.627 --> 05:29.428
We have to                      
sit a second.                   
                        What?   

05:29.496 --> 05:33.932
Look, I don't                   
want this to be                 
that we just <i>do</i> it.             

05:34.000 --> 05:35.901
I want this to be special.      

05:35.969 --> 05:37.236
I mean,                         
what's going to happen          

05:37.303 --> 05:38.971
when our child asks us          
about the night we conceived?   

05:39.039 --> 05:40.005
What are we going to say?       

05:40.073 --> 05:41.607
                How about, "Mind
             your own business"?

05:41.675 --> 05:44.777
Sam, be serious.                

05:44.844 --> 05:47.312
I know. I know.                 

05:47.380 --> 05:49.214
Let's do something that         

05:49.282 --> 05:51.450
you have never done             
before with a woman.            

05:51.518 --> 05:53.318
        All right, all right.   

05:59.693 --> 06:01.026
    Okay, okay, okay.           

06:01.094 --> 06:02.094
Let... let... let's do something

06:02.162 --> 06:03.095
  that you've only done once.   

06:03.163 --> 06:04.430
                Okay. All right.

06:04.497 --> 06:06.965
                  You got, uh...
            You've got, uh...   

06:10.203 --> 06:12.805
    Let's just have a nice,     
simple, romantic evening.       

06:12.872 --> 06:13.939
                 All right. Now,
                  that I can do.

06:14.007 --> 06:14.940
                  That I can do.
                  Tell you what.

06:15.008 --> 06:15.974
                    You got a   
            fireplace, right?   

06:16.042 --> 06:17.776
Yeah.                           
             Well, there you go.

06:17.844 --> 06:19.211
         It's a perfect evening.

06:19.279 --> 06:21.580
                Dinner, fire,   
             a little Jiffy Pop.

06:21.648 --> 06:23.449
Sam, don't be crass.            
                     No, no, no.

06:23.516 --> 06:25.617
                I was talking   
                  about popcorn.
    Oh!                         

06:25.685 --> 06:27.653
That was funny.                 

06:27.721 --> 06:28.954
Oh, you've got a date!          

06:29.022 --> 06:30.222
                      All right.
                  Wait a minute.

06:30.290 --> 06:31.490
Woody, we're out of here.       

06:31.558 --> 06:32.825
  You're in charge of the bar.  

06:32.892 --> 06:35.027
          Well, why bother, Sam?

06:35.095 --> 06:36.295
            Whenever you        
         put me in charge,      

06:36.363 --> 06:38.063
                nobody ever     
            listens to me.      

06:38.131 --> 06:39.465
          I just get laughed at,

06:39.532 --> 06:40.866
                  and get drinks
            poured over my head.

06:40.934 --> 06:42.968
If anyone does that to you,     
you just sic Carla on them.     

06:43.036 --> 06:44.570
                     I'm talking
                    about Carla.

06:44.637 --> 06:46.372
        Oh.                     

06:46.439 --> 06:48.173
All right,                      
listen up, everybody!           

06:48.241 --> 06:50.042
Whenever Rebecca and I          
aren't in the bar, uh...        

06:50.110 --> 06:51.810
Woody's in charge.              

06:51.878 --> 06:54.013
      (everyone laughing)       

06:59.652 --> 07:01.387
That better?                    

07:01.454 --> 07:03.956
    Kind of. At least           
     it's not a margarita.      

07:04.024 --> 07:06.759
Those get salt in my eyes.      

07:06.826 --> 07:09.328
Listen, I'm...                  
I'm out of here, guys.          

07:09.396 --> 07:10.796
          I'll be back          
      in a couple of hours      

07:10.964 --> 07:12.231
          depending on          
      how things go here.       

07:12.298 --> 07:13.399
        Where're you going, Sam?

07:13.466 --> 07:16.201
  It... it's kind of personal,  
             Norm.              

07:16.269 --> 07:18.771
                  Ah! Uh, let me
            get that for you.   
    Oh.                         

07:18.838 --> 07:20.339
                    Here we go. 

07:22.409 --> 07:24.309
                  Sammy's acting
             kind of weird, huh?

07:24.377 --> 07:25.444
    Yeah.                       

07:25.512 --> 07:28.113
      Can't you beer butts      
         figure it out?         

07:28.181 --> 07:29.448
            Sam's been searching
                    for weeks   

07:29.516 --> 07:31.650
         to find a perfect woman
            to have his baby.   

07:31.718 --> 07:34.319
        Obviously, he's given up
              and asked Rebecca.

07:35.622 --> 07:38.323
No way. Something that big,     
Sammy would have told us.       

07:38.391 --> 07:41.427
            Why do you assume   
                 the rest of the
                  world lives by

07:41.494 --> 07:44.229
              your outdated code
                of male bonding?

07:44.297 --> 07:45.931
                    Do you think
                  that every man

07:45.999 --> 07:47.466
                     goes around
             telling his buddies

07:47.534 --> 07:49.468
              when he decides to
              sire an offspring?

07:49.536 --> 07:52.071
Frasier did.                    

07:58.378 --> 08:00.045
    Anyhoo...                   

08:04.584 --> 08:06.585
                (coughing)      

08:06.653 --> 08:08.754
     Woody, can you do something
            about that smoke?   

08:08.822 --> 08:11.290
    Don't worry, Mr. Clavin,    
     I'll take care of it.      

08:11.358 --> 08:12.691
                (coughs)        

08:14.194 --> 08:15.961
    Excuse me, sir.             
    My name                     

08:16.029 --> 08:17.496
                  is Woody Boyd,
                 and I'm kind of

08:17.564 --> 08:18.697
                    in charge   
                here tonight.   

08:18.765 --> 08:20.032
    Well, my friend             
    over there                  

08:20.100 --> 08:22.401
    is kind of bothered         
    by your smoke,              

08:22.469 --> 08:24.169
         and so I was hoping you
          could move to the back

08:24.237 --> 08:25.771
         to the smoking section.

08:25.839 --> 08:27.840
    I think that would really be
    the considerate thing to do.

08:27.907 --> 08:30.676
You can tell                    
your friend this.               

08:30.744 --> 08:32.711
                (coughing)      

08:36.750 --> 08:38.817
            So, Woody, what     
            did he say?         

08:38.885 --> 08:39.485
            (coughs)            

08:46.593 --> 08:48.727
Wow. I'm impressed.             

08:48.795 --> 08:51.430
Where did you learn             
how to cook?                    

08:51.498 --> 08:52.931
            When I was a kid,   
             my mom thought that

08:52.999 --> 08:56.135
              all boys should do
        a little bit of cooking.

08:56.202 --> 08:57.703
I never knew that.              

08:57.837 --> 08:59.438
                Oh, yeah. I have
            a sensitive side.   

08:59.506 --> 09:02.574
    Matter of fact, why don't   
            we put on some music

09:02.642 --> 09:05.110
             and see how long it
        takes you to find it.   

09:07.313 --> 09:09.515
Where do you keep               
your Johnny Mathis?             

09:09.582 --> 09:10.683
                I don't think   
                     I have any.

09:10.750 --> 09:13.652
Oh. Well, who needs music?      

09:13.720 --> 09:15.387
Allow me.                       

09:17.991 --> 09:21.960
    ¶ Look at me... ¶           

09:22.028 --> 09:24.096
I didn't know you               
could sing that high.           

09:24.164 --> 09:26.732
        I couldn't              
      before the coatrack.      

09:26.800 --> 09:31.770
    (humming "Misty")           

09:31.838 --> 09:34.073
        (giggling)              

09:34.140 --> 09:35.607
                    What?       

09:35.675 --> 09:37.109
        Nothing.                

09:37.177 --> 09:38.410
    I'm just nervous.           

09:38.478 --> 09:40.479
            Oh, come on. Nothing
            to be nervous about.

09:40.547 --> 09:41.814
Oh, no. I mean,                 
we're going to make             

09:41.881 --> 09:43.949
the biggest decision            
of our lives.                   

09:44.017 --> 09:46.418
    I mean, don't you think     
that's a little bit scary?      

09:46.486 --> 09:50.489
Come on. You can't...           
can't pressure yourself         
like that.                      

09:50.557 --> 09:52.124
    I mean, you know,           
        once we do this,        

09:52.192 --> 09:53.559
there's no turning back.        

09:53.626 --> 09:54.993
        No, no, no, no. Come on.

09:55.061 --> 09:57.029
        That's just the thing   
     you can't think about here.

09:57.097 --> 10:01.166
      "After tonight, everything
    will be different for life."

10:01.234 --> 10:03.602
      Or, uh... "I may have done
        this a million times,   

10:03.670 --> 10:07.806
                 but this is the
            one that counts."   

10:07.874 --> 10:10.809
              I mean, you, uh...
        you start doing that,   

10:10.877 --> 10:13.612
        you're not going        
      to be able to do it.      

10:13.680 --> 10:15.981
    Sam, you're not thinking    
    about it, are you?          

10:16.049 --> 10:18.751
         No, no. Don't be silly.

10:18.818 --> 10:22.988
Oh, you're right, Sam.          

10:23.056 --> 10:24.456
Let's just go for it.           

10:24.524 --> 10:26.925
                Uh... Right now?

10:26.993 --> 10:28.527
It's now or never, Sam.         
                        Uh...   

10:28.595 --> 10:31.030
Let's make a baby.              

10:31.097 --> 10:33.699
                 No, you know...
        but... but right now?   

10:33.767 --> 10:35.267
What's the matter?              

10:35.335 --> 10:36.568
        Nothing's the matter.   
                 Don't be silly.

10:36.636 --> 10:37.770
        Nothing's the matter.   

10:37.837 --> 10:39.538
                 It's just that,
                 uh... you know,

10:39.606 --> 10:40.973
          not everything's right
            right now, you know?

10:41.041 --> 10:43.375
Uh... we don't                  
have Johnny Mathis.             
Yeah, that's it.                

10:43.443 --> 10:45.310
Uh... tell you what.            
Why don't I, uh...              

10:45.378 --> 10:46.945
         Why don't I go         
      to the record store?      

10:47.013 --> 10:49.148
I'll be right back.             
                      No! Sam...

10:49.215 --> 10:52.418
 If we're going to make a baby, 
  I'm going to need my Johnny!  

11:07.634 --> 11:09.635
              What's wrong, Sam?

11:15.709 --> 11:18.644
                Sam, what is it?

11:18.712 --> 11:20.346
I... I... I...                  

11:20.413 --> 11:21.347
                     What? What?

11:21.414 --> 11:23.315
              Is it an accident?
                         A fire?

11:23.383 --> 11:24.983
                  Do you want us
                  to follow you?

11:27.487 --> 11:31.423
            Sam, look. Just pull
            yourself together   

11:31.491 --> 11:32.725
         and tell me what it is.

11:32.792 --> 11:37.062
        I... can't.             

11:37.130 --> 11:38.964
                Yes, you can.   

11:39.032 --> 11:40.599
             Look. Just organize
                  your thoughts,

11:40.667 --> 11:42.267
                 form the words,
                    and tell me.

11:42.335 --> 11:44.770
    I can't.                    
                Sam, if you want
                 me to help you,

11:44.838 --> 11:46.872
         you're going to have to
    tell me what the problem is.

11:46.940 --> 11:47.940
        I am!                   

11:48.008 --> 11:49.141
         Well, then, what is it?

11:49.209 --> 11:50.542
    I can't!                    

11:50.610 --> 11:51.677
                 You can't what?

11:55.382 --> 11:56.815
                  Oh, dear Lord.

11:56.916 --> 11:58.484
                  Am I to assume
                 that Sam Malone

11:58.551 --> 11:59.718
                is unable to...?

12:05.725 --> 12:07.192
 You gotta help me, man.        

12:08.261 --> 12:09.695
                 All right, Sam.
                    Let's, uh...

12:09.763 --> 12:10.829
                Let's examine   
             this problem. Uh...

12:10.897 --> 12:11.997
Okay.                           

12:12.098 --> 12:13.632
          What is the difference

12:13.700 --> 12:15.334
         between this experience

12:15.402 --> 12:18.070
      and the thousands of times
          that have gone before?

12:18.138 --> 12:20.005
All right. Well, uh...          

12:20.073 --> 12:22.074
It was with Rebecca.            

12:22.142 --> 12:23.676
            You've been intimate
            with Rebecca before?

12:23.777 --> 12:25.044
    Yeah. No. It...             

12:25.111 --> 12:28.013
It's not sex. I mean,           
we want to have a baby.         

12:28.081 --> 12:29.548
            We...               

12:29.616 --> 12:31.016
What we're trying to do is, is  

12:31.084 --> 12:33.018
wholesome and natural           
and beautiful,                  

12:33.086 --> 12:35.020
and it's turning me off.        

12:37.524 --> 12:39.024
          (door opens)          

12:39.092 --> 12:41.694
        Sam, your whole life,   

12:41.761 --> 12:46.198
            has been a string of
  meaningless, albeit enjoyable,

12:46.299 --> 12:48.033
         sexual encounters. Now,

12:48.134 --> 12:50.002
             for the first time,
                you're engaging 

12:50.103 --> 12:52.371
              in a meaningful,  
              productive pursuit

12:52.439 --> 12:54.707
     See, it's a common conflict
            between what we call

12:54.774 --> 12:58.210
            recreational sex and
              procreational sex.

12:58.278 --> 12:59.311
            What?               

12:59.379 --> 13:01.213
                 Well, dirty sex
                  and clean sex.

13:01.314 --> 13:02.681
        Oh.                     

13:02.749 --> 13:06.885
Now, it is this conflict that is
  making you unable to function.

13:06.953 --> 13:08.987
     Oh. Oh, yeah.              
     That's good.               

13:09.055 --> 13:10.189
    All right. Wow.             

13:10.256 --> 13:11.857
  For a minute there,           
    I thought maybe             

13:11.925 --> 13:14.960
there was something wrong       
with the seal on my microwave.  

13:17.864 --> 13:19.064
                    Now, Sam,   

13:19.132 --> 13:22.001
            what you're gonna   
            have to do is, is   

13:22.068 --> 13:26.705
         keep your mind thinking
                of dirty things.

13:26.773 --> 13:28.340
            You see what I mean.

13:29.576 --> 13:31.010
Skip everything about a baby.   

13:31.077 --> 13:33.345
        Forget that Rebecca's   
              gonna be a mother.

13:33.413 --> 13:35.014
              Forget that you're
              gonna be a father.

13:35.081 --> 13:38.784
     Instead, concentrate on the
 heat, the passion you generate.

13:38.852 --> 13:41.020
            Trick your body into
                thinking of this

13:41.087 --> 13:43.522
          as just another tawdry
             one-night stand.   

13:43.590 --> 13:44.790
         Come with me.          

13:47.360 --> 13:48.594
             You can do it, Sam.

13:48.661 --> 13:49.862
                    You have to.

13:49.929 --> 13:51.864
                 You owe it to  
                 men everywhere.

13:53.299 --> 13:54.700
        Yeah. All right,        
     all right, all right.      

13:54.768 --> 13:55.834
          Think heat.           

13:55.902 --> 13:58.470
Think heat. Think heat.         

13:58.538 --> 13:59.672
Think heat, think heat.         

13:59.739 --> 14:01.707
    Think heat, think heat.     

14:01.775 --> 14:03.175
    Not yet, not yet.           

14:05.445 --> 14:06.712
                Hey, Woodrot.   

14:06.780 --> 14:09.248
     What's with the cigar      
    party back there?           

14:09.315 --> 14:11.183
Well, the smoking section       
    wasn't big enough,          

14:11.251 --> 14:13.318
         so exercising          
    my powers as a manager,     

14:13.386 --> 14:14.987
I moved everybody               
back into the pool room         

14:15.055 --> 14:16.088
                  Yeah, well, if
                  you'd exercise

14:16.156 --> 14:17.456
                     your brain,
                you'd realize   

14:17.524 --> 14:19.525
     there are no vents, and the
     windows are painted shut.  

14:19.592 --> 14:22.561
         It's like Clavin in the
      middle of July back there.

14:22.629 --> 14:24.663
                Well, what do   
                you expect?     

14:24.731 --> 14:27.333
    There's no vents and the    
    windows are painted shut.   

14:29.069 --> 14:30.936
Don't worry, Carla,             
I've installed a fan.           

14:31.004 --> 14:31.970
                          CARLA:
                             Oh.

14:32.072 --> 14:35.274
All I gotta do is               
some simple wiring.             

14:36.376 --> 14:38.243
        (phone ringing)         

14:38.345 --> 14:39.378
                  Cheers.       

14:39.446 --> 14:40.512
                It's nice to see

14:40.580 --> 14:41.880
        Woody in charge, huh?   

14:41.948 --> 14:43.549
            Seems like only     
            yesterday he, uh,   

14:43.616 --> 14:45.017
              couldn't find his 
             way around the bar,

14:45.085 --> 14:47.553
                 and he got lost
            in the storeroom.   

14:47.620 --> 14:48.887
That <i>was</i> yesterday.             

14:50.757 --> 14:53.859
      Phone call for you,       
          Chalk Face.           

14:53.927 --> 14:55.327
                Thank you...    

14:55.395 --> 14:57.196
          Velcro Top.           

14:59.332 --> 15:00.866
             I've been waiting  
                to use that.    

15:03.703 --> 15:04.903
             Hello?             

15:04.971 --> 15:06.472
            REBECCA:            
            Lilith.             
             Yeah?              

15:06.573 --> 15:08.440
     Ha-Has Sam been there?     

15:08.541 --> 15:10.175
 Uh, he was, but he just left.  

15:10.243 --> 15:11.643
      Did he say anything?      

15:11.711 --> 15:12.745
        Not to me. Why?         

15:12.812 --> 15:14.513
        Can I trust you?        

15:14.581 --> 15:16.682
        Of course               
    you can trust me.           

15:16.750 --> 15:17.950
      I'm a professional.       

15:18.018 --> 15:19.785
     If you have a problem,     
     I'm more than equipped     

15:19.853 --> 15:21.820
  to help you work through it   
     in a rational manner.      

15:21.888 --> 15:22.821
Woody, two beers.               

15:22.889 --> 15:24.490
         Shut up. This is juicy.

15:29.029 --> 15:31.163
  I'm sorry. Please continue.   

15:31.231 --> 15:34.333
      You know, Sam and I       
are trying to have a baby.      

15:34.401 --> 15:37.670
    All right, tonight          
        when we were...         

15:37.737 --> 15:39.538
  Just when things got all...   

15:39.606 --> 15:40.639
        you know, heated        

15:40.707 --> 15:42.574
     and involved, well...      

15:42.676 --> 15:45.210
         he left for no         
apparent reason. I mean...      

15:45.278 --> 15:47.012
    I don't think Sam           
         was turned on.         

15:47.080 --> 15:50.983
 Oh, my God. The seventh sign.  

15:51.051 --> 15:53.018
        Now, look, what         
    am I doing wrong?           

15:53.086 --> 15:54.687
  A-am I, am I not hot enough?  

15:54.754 --> 15:56.021
     Am I not sexy enough?      

15:56.122 --> 15:58.524
    Actually, Rebecca,          
    perhaps you're <i>too</i> sexy.    

15:58.591 --> 15:59.525
    What do you mean?           

15:59.592 --> 16:02.494
         And thank you.         

16:02.562 --> 16:03.529
             Well,              

16:03.596 --> 16:04.963
Sam is the type of person       

16:05.031 --> 16:07.566
    for whom sex has always     
      been down and dirty.      

16:07.634 --> 16:09.835
      Now that he's trying      
    to father a child,          

16:09.903 --> 16:12.438
dirty sex is the furthest       
      thing from his mind.      

16:12.505 --> 16:13.806
    He wants it clean.          

16:13.873 --> 16:15.841
        So what do I do?        

16:15.909 --> 16:19.078
      Well, don't act hot       
and sexy, that's for sure.      

16:19.179 --> 16:22.481
    Just keep reminding him     
    that he's making a baby.    

16:22.549 --> 16:25.984
     The evening should be      
        sacred and holy.        

16:26.052 --> 16:28.721
That'll get his engine running. 

16:28.788 --> 16:30.923
    I got it, Lilith.           
    Thank you so much.          

16:30.990 --> 16:32.658
    All right.                  

16:32.726 --> 16:34.193
                Who was that on 
                the phone, dear?

16:34.260 --> 16:35.828
I was just                      
counseling Rebecca.             

16:35.895 --> 16:37.529
    And I was counseling Sam.   

16:37.597 --> 16:39.999
             Recreational versus
             procreational sex? 

16:40.066 --> 16:41.166
    Exactly.                    

16:41.234 --> 16:43.435
They're so lucky to have us.    

16:43.503 --> 16:45.037
                          CARLA:
                          Woody!

16:45.105 --> 16:46.338
                        We can't
                breathe in here.

16:46.406 --> 16:48.841
             We need you to turn
             on that stupid fan.

16:48.908 --> 16:50.676
        All right.              
     It's all ready to go.      

16:50.744 --> 16:52.945
         All I gotta do         
    is throw a switch.          

16:53.013 --> 16:53.912
        (switch clicks)         

16:54.047 --> 16:55.280
         (fan running)          

16:55.348 --> 16:57.316
        (yelling)               

16:59.686 --> 17:02.454
                          Woody!

17:02.555 --> 17:04.690
                    (yelling)   

17:04.758 --> 17:06.358
                          Woody!

17:10.130 --> 17:11.696
    (knocking on door)          

17:11.765 --> 17:13.098
          Honey? Oh...          

17:13.266 --> 17:14.465
Thank God you're still here.    

17:14.534 --> 17:16.367
I'm sorry I ran out like that.  

17:16.435 --> 17:17.970
             Sam, don't say     
             another word.      

17:18.038 --> 17:19.805
          Everything's going    
        to be just fine.        

17:23.810 --> 17:25.978
Oh, yeah. Oh, this is hot.      

17:26.046 --> 17:27.980
                 Mmm...         

17:28.048 --> 17:32.351
    With heat like this, you'll 
    fertilize my egg in no time.

17:33.620 --> 17:34.653
    Yeah, uh...                 

17:34.721 --> 17:35.654
Anyway, anyway, uh...           

17:35.722 --> 17:36.922
Just... Why, I tell you,        

17:36.990 --> 17:40.025
you are looking                 
so sexy tonight.                
                         Yeah...

17:40.093 --> 17:43.028
          I'm about to grow your
          child inside my womb. 

17:44.230 --> 17:45.831
Hotcha, hotcha, hotcha.         

17:45.932 --> 17:49.001
              And then I'll give
            birth to a new life,

17:49.069 --> 17:53.472
             and you'll be there
            to cut that cord.   

17:53.540 --> 17:56.275
Are you gonna be talking        
like this all night?            
                          You...

17:56.343 --> 17:59.645
  You ain't heard nothing yet,  
    O, giver of life.           

17:59.746 --> 18:02.014
Giver....                       
Excuse. excuse me               
just a second.                  

18:02.115 --> 18:03.315
                    Hang on.    
    What...                     

18:03.450 --> 18:05.317
            (mutters)           

18:07.454 --> 18:11.290
REBECCA:                        
What's going on                 
in there... Daddy?              

18:11.358 --> 18:12.624
 Uh, I'll be right out, Mommy.  

18:12.692 --> 18:14.626
      Uh, I mean... <i>Mama.</i>       

18:15.562 --> 18:16.495
             Hello.             

18:16.563 --> 18:17.496
             Norm.              
             Yeah.              

18:17.564 --> 18:18.897
        Uh, what are you        
    doing there, man?           

18:18.965 --> 18:20.032
    Uh, where's Woody?          

18:20.133 --> 18:22.634
                    (gagging)   
    He's otherwise engaged.     

18:25.238 --> 18:27.106
     Well, uh, Norm, Norm,      
      let me, let me talk       

18:27.173 --> 18:28.107
     to Frasier, will you?      

18:28.174 --> 18:29.808
        Yeah... Frasier.        

18:29.876 --> 18:31.210
    Sammy.                      

18:34.714 --> 18:35.781
        What is it, Sam?        

18:35.849 --> 18:37.449
        Listen. This is         
    not working, man.           

18:37.517 --> 18:39.118
        (water running)         
    I'm thinking hot,           
    and all she keeps doing     

18:39.185 --> 18:40.386
        is talking              
    about mother and stuff.     

18:40.453 --> 18:42.388
     You must keep it hot,      
         Sam. Trust me.         

18:42.489 --> 18:43.822
    I'm trying. I'm trying.     

18:43.957 --> 18:45.991
    Sam, where are you now?     

18:46.059 --> 18:47.393
        Uh, I'm in              
        the kitchen,            

18:47.460 --> 18:48.527
    but don't worry.            
    She can't hear me.          

18:48.595 --> 18:50.562
I'm, uh, I'm running            
the water here,                 

18:50.663 --> 18:52.197
        You can do that?        

18:52.265 --> 18:53.666
 Whenever I hear water running, 

18:53.733 --> 18:55.868
      it gives me the urge      
     to go to the bathroom.     

18:55.969 --> 18:58.704
    Well, thanks a lot, man.    

18:58.805 --> 19:00.806
    In fact, just hearing it    
     now, over the phone...     

19:03.009 --> 19:03.942
     Lilith, would you...?      

19:06.379 --> 19:07.613
            Frasier!            

19:07.747 --> 19:08.981
              Sam?              

19:09.115 --> 19:11.383
            Lilith.             

19:11.484 --> 19:12.618
    Is everything all right?    

19:12.686 --> 19:14.887
 Uh, Yeah, sure. No, it's fine. 

19:14.988 --> 19:17.089
    Let me talk to Rebecca.     

19:17.157 --> 19:18.891
Um, all right. Okay. Hold,      

19:18.992 --> 19:20.192
  hold on a second, will you?   

19:22.128 --> 19:23.429
        Yeah, it's for          
        you. It's Lilith.       

19:23.496 --> 19:24.697
                Excuse me.      

19:28.234 --> 19:29.168
            Lilith?             

19:29.235 --> 19:30.169
              Yes?              

19:30.236 --> 19:31.503
    It's not working.           

19:31.571 --> 19:33.305
      I've done everything      
     you've told me to do,      

19:33.373 --> 19:34.873
 an-and he still has a problem. 

19:34.941 --> 19:37.743
    Sounds to me like you're    
     still being too sexy.      

19:37.844 --> 19:39.111
Well, I don't know how...       

19:39.179 --> 19:42.214
You know, you are <i>so</i> kind.      

19:42.282 --> 19:44.183
     Redouble your efforts.     

19:44.250 --> 19:46.518
You must remain wholesome,      
        no matter what.         

19:46.586 --> 19:47.720
        Trust me.               

19:47.787 --> 19:49.021
        I'll do my best.        

19:49.222 --> 19:50.689
        All right.              

19:55.128 --> 19:56.428
             All right, Rebecca,

19:56.563 --> 19:58.731
                That's it. No,  
                no more talking.

19:58.798 --> 20:00.833
             Just down and dirty
            from here on out.   

20:05.171 --> 20:06.939
  (both moaning passionately)   

20:07.007 --> 20:08.340
                 Oh, Sam...     

20:08.408 --> 20:10.542
          as long as we're down 
            here on our knees,  

20:10.610 --> 20:11.744
      Yes?                      

20:11.811 --> 20:14.013
             I think we ought to
          take this chance to...

20:14.080 --> 20:16.682
    thank God for the great gift
    He's about to give us.      

20:17.784 --> 20:19.018
 Oh... that's it.               

20:19.085 --> 20:20.152
I give up.                      

20:20.253 --> 20:21.320
              What's the matter?

20:21.388 --> 20:23.355
How do you expect me            
to get in the mood              

20:23.423 --> 20:25.024
when you're talking             
about babies and cords          

20:25.091 --> 20:26.291
and God and stuff?              

20:26.359 --> 20:28.460
        Well, I thought that's  
        what you wanted to hear.

20:28.528 --> 20:30.696
Where did you get that idea?    
                         Lilith.

20:30.764 --> 20:32.064
     Lilith!                    

20:32.132 --> 20:33.699
You talked to                   
Lilith about us?                

20:33.767 --> 20:35.034
Oh, come on,                    
I thought                       

20:35.101 --> 20:37.036
this was just supposed          
to be between you and me.       

20:37.103 --> 20:38.937
I can't believe you shared      
this with somebody else.        

20:39.005 --> 20:41.507
     Besides, Frasier said      
we're supposed to act hot.      

20:44.244 --> 20:45.711
            Sam...              

20:45.779 --> 20:49.281
 if you were having a problem,  
  why didn't you just tell me?  

20:49.349 --> 20:50.616
Well, no. Wait, wait.           

20:50.684 --> 20:52.284
Who said I was                  
having a problem?               

20:52.352 --> 20:54.420
              Well, weren't you?

20:54.487 --> 20:55.621
        Maybe.                  

20:56.956 --> 20:58.090
                    Sam.        

20:58.158 --> 20:59.224
             Oh...              

20:59.292 --> 21:00.926
             You could've done  
            both of us a favor  

21:00.994 --> 21:02.661
         if you had just told me
         what I was doing wrong.

21:02.729 --> 21:04.663
No. Oh, come on, you            
weren't doing anything wrong.   

21:04.731 --> 21:06.432
It wasn't you.                  
     It was me.                 

21:06.499 --> 21:08.667
I mean, I've had sex            
millions of times,              

21:08.735 --> 21:11.003
but it's, it's never            
had a purpose before.           

21:12.305 --> 21:13.672
Well, that's not true.          

21:13.740 --> 21:15.808
It had a purpose, but, uh...    

21:15.875 --> 21:18.677
It didn't...                    
it didn't have a goal.          

21:18.745 --> 21:20.479
No, it had a goal.              
It just...                      

21:20.547 --> 21:21.714
  It's complicated.             

21:21.815 --> 21:24.350
             Sam, Sam, look. You
          don't have to explain.

21:24.417 --> 21:26.852
     I just wish you'd been able
     to talk to me, that's all. 

21:26.920 --> 21:28.787
Yeah, you're probably right.    

21:28.855 --> 21:30.656
             I mean, if we can't
        even talk to each other,

21:30.724 --> 21:32.157
            what kind of parents
            are we gonna make?  

21:32.225 --> 21:34.259
Not very good ones.             

21:34.327 --> 21:37.029
             Sam, maybe we're   
             not ready for this.

21:38.031 --> 21:39.965
         Maybe.                 

21:43.303 --> 21:44.837
    Shoot.                      

21:48.775 --> 21:51.210
Well, uh... I guess             
I'd better go, huh?             
                      Okay.     

21:52.946 --> 21:54.046
    Are you sure you're okay?   

21:54.114 --> 21:55.047
Yeah, I'm fine.                 

21:55.115 --> 21:56.248
You okay?                       

21:56.316 --> 21:57.583
                    Oh, yeah.   

21:57.650 --> 22:02.488
 ¶ I am as helpless as a kitten 
         up a tree... ¶         

22:02.555 --> 22:03.522
         (both chuckle)         

22:03.590 --> 22:04.790
How about that?                 

22:04.858 --> 22:06.191
Johnny Mathis.                  

22:06.259 --> 22:08.660
Say, I don't suppose your       
neighbor is single, huh?        

22:08.728 --> 22:11.363
                     Yes, he is.
    Oh.                         

22:11.431 --> 22:12.664
     ¶ I can't understand ¶     

22:12.732 --> 22:14.333
    ¶ I get misty... ¶          

22:14.401 --> 22:15.668
Bye-bye.                        

22:15.735 --> 22:22.341
 ¶ Just holding your hand... ¶  

22:22.409 --> 22:28.180
        ¶ Walk my way ¶         

22:28.248 --> 22:34.019
    ¶ And a thousand violins    
        begin to play ¶         

22:34.087 --> 22:36.021
¶ Or it might be the sound... ¶ 

22:45.098 --> 22:47.032
(moaning):                      
Oh, baby...                     

22:47.100 --> 22:49.368
                  Would you stop
                saying that!
