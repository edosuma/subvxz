Help! My friend,

03:38.100 --> 03:41.080
Sir Walter De Souza.
London City Council.

03:41.100 --> 03:44.080
Man of influence and authority.
And known foe of the music halls.

03:44.100 --> 03:46.080
And now snatched from within
one such.

03:46.100 --> 03:48.080
He will scorn them the bitterer now.
Ah, Blewett!

03:48.100 --> 03:51.080
Inspector! We are grateful
for your alacrity in this matter.

03:51.100 --> 03:54.080
I would shake the hand
of the great Inspector Reid.

03:54.100 --> 03:57.080
Enemies we may be
in the fictive world -

03:57.100 --> 03:59.100
but I hope I may call you friend,
sir.

04:00.100 --> 04:01.100
What?

04:03.100 --> 04:05.100
You play at Ripper?

04:06.100 --> 04:08.080
Whilst you profit!

04:08.100 --> 04:10.080
Come, Inspector. We are artists.

04:10.100 --> 04:12.080
And artists must hold a mirror
to the world they see.

04:12.100 --> 04:15.080
You will see my cell
and my Sergeant's fists

04:15.100 --> 04:17.079
beating out a confession
as to how you conspired to abduct

04:17.100 --> 04:20.079
a city councillor
from your own theatre of vice.

04:20.100 --> 04:22.079
No, sir.

04:22.100 --> 04:24.080
Here you see his friend.

04:24.100 --> 04:26.080
We care for him.

04:26.100 --> 04:30.080
Mr Pembury, who was at Mr De Souza's
side throughout.

04:30.100 --> 04:33.080
Good evening to you, sir.
Will you tell us what has happened?

04:33.100 --> 04:34.080
Sergeant Drake!

04:34.100 --> 04:37.080
Yes, he, he was here... Miss Rose.
Beside me.

04:37.100 --> 04:40.080
The lights went black.
There was a disturbance.

04:40.100 --> 04:42.080
The lights returned. He'd vanished.

04:42.100 --> 04:44.080
Blewett - this darkness,
is it part of the act?

04:44.100 --> 04:46.080
Indeed. Indispensable.

04:46.100 --> 04:48.080
And your workers stage and serving -
all accounted for?

04:48.100 --> 04:53.080
Inspector. If I may, I don't see
Ettie Leigh, servant girl.

04:53.100 --> 04:55.080
And the last time you saw her, man?

04:55.100 --> 05:01.080
I...my apologies. I only pay proper
heed to the girls I...slit, sir.

05:01.100 --> 05:06.080
Excuse me, Sergeant. Ettie told me
she'd see to the toff.

05:06.100 --> 05:08.080
You, Rose. As a serving girl,
you know the routine?

05:08.100 --> 05:10.080
Like clockwork, Mr Reid.

05:10.100 --> 05:12.080
And the lights are dimmed
for how long?

05:12.100 --> 05:14.080
Perhaps 15 seconds.

05:14.100 --> 05:16.100
So to exploit it, one would need
similar knowledge. Ettie Leigh?

05:18.100 --> 05:20.080
We will find Sir Walter,
Mr Pembury. But your...

05:20.100 --> 05:24.080
your own injuries, sir.
The blood is not his own, Inspector.

05:24.100 --> 05:26.080
Your lackey pronounces it so.

05:26.100 --> 05:28.080
Reid.

05:28.100 --> 05:30.080
Take in an entertainment, do we?

05:30.100 --> 05:32.080
Entertainment's a broad term,
Inspector.

05:32.100 --> 05:36.080
See, we have blood leading back
through the stage door.

05:36.100 --> 05:38.080
Regular smeared intervals.

05:38.100 --> 05:41.080
Your boy Flight rootles around
out there already.

05:41.100 --> 05:43.080
Knocked cold and dragged out.

05:43.100 --> 05:44.080
I've scoured the laneway, sir.

05:44.100 --> 05:46.080
What do you observe?

05:46.100 --> 05:47.080
Wheel tracks, sir.

05:47.100 --> 05:51.080
Carriage or cart? From the width
of the rim, I would say a cart.

05:53.100 --> 05:54.080
What is it, Constable?

05:54.100 --> 05:58.080
Er, it is excrement.
Human, I believe.

05:58.100 --> 06:02.080
A night-soil cart? These streets
are piped for sewerage.

06:02.100 --> 06:05.080
It was an artful escape.
Everyone would have avoided them.

06:05.100 --> 06:06.100
Flight, throw your light over here.

06:08.100 --> 06:12.080
Cigarette ends where an accomplice
must have waited.

06:12.100 --> 06:15.080
Tobacco's damp. I'll dry it out.
See what brand was smoked.

06:15.100 --> 06:17.080
Flight, the night-soil men
of London. Their numbers dwindle.

06:17.100 --> 06:19.100
Find all those whose collections
pass nearby. Sir.

06:25.100 --> 06:29.080
Weed. It's Datura Stramonium -
Jimson weed.

06:29.100 --> 06:34.080
Leaf of the Solanaceae family, found
courtesy of my American brothers.

06:34.100 --> 06:36.080
Gypsies use it as an analgesic.

06:36.100 --> 06:42.080
And I believe it's being delivered
in a new brand of cigarette,

06:42.100 --> 06:44.080
a brand aimed
squarely at the ladies.

06:44.100 --> 06:47.080
'Joy cigarettes afford relief
in cases of asthma and wheezing

06:47.100 --> 06:50.100
'and with a little perseverance,
effect a permanent cure.'

06:51.100 --> 06:54.080
A cigarette for women?

06:54.100 --> 06:57.080
Inspector, sir, I've the night-soil
man collected for you.

06:57.100 --> 06:59.080
Sergeant Artherton
complained about the odour.

06:59.100 --> 07:03.100
I thought it best, however,
not to leave him outdoors.

07:06.100 --> 07:08.100
Mr Urwin, sir.

07:20.100 --> 07:25.080
Mr Urwin, a man has been snatched
from Blewett's music hall.

07:25.100 --> 07:26.100
Your cart used for his removal.

07:29.100 --> 07:34.080
No, sir. Myself, my cart -
we are blameless, I swear it.

07:34.100 --> 07:38.100
You shall speak, sir,
if you have affection for yourself.

07:40.100 --> 07:45.100
My cart...it were thieved,
two nights back.

07:46.100 --> 07:48.080
How was it thieved, Mr Urwin?

07:48.100 --> 07:52.100
There was many of them, sir.
I fought hard as I could.

07:53.100 --> 07:56.080
But they prevailed, in time.

07:56.100 --> 08:01.080
Vicious, they were.
Fierce, like lions.

08:01.100 --> 08:05.080
They were...women,

08:05.100 --> 08:06.100
were they not, Sir Urwin?

08:10.100 --> 08:13.100
This the reason
for your reticent shame?

08:14.100 --> 08:16.080
It is, Mr Reid.

08:16.100 --> 08:20.080
It is a crew of women we hunt,
Sergeant.

08:20.100 --> 08:23.080
Oh believe me, Mr Artherton. When he
hears what I have to share with him,

08:23.100 --> 08:26.080
he will be glad.
Do you know, Mr Best,

08:26.100 --> 08:30.080
I keep a list of what might provoke
such emotion in the Inspector.

08:30.100 --> 08:31.080
Indeed? Mmm.

08:31.100 --> 08:35.080
Various painful deaths befalling
your good self feature frequently.

08:35.100 --> 08:37.080
Quite the charmer,
are you not, Sergeant?

08:37.100 --> 08:39.080
I do try, Mr Best.

08:39.100 --> 08:41.080
Oh, now I feel the late hour.

08:41.100 --> 08:44.080
Flight, put an alert out
for this man's cart.

08:44.100 --> 08:46.080
Find its resting place,
we find De Souza.

08:46.100 --> 08:48.080
What's that? Was that Mr De Souza?

08:48.100 --> 08:50.080
How uncanny, Mr Reid.

08:50.100 --> 08:53.080
I received a letter from that
very man just two hours ago,

08:53.100 --> 08:57.100
so I have come visiting to give you
prior knowledge of tomorrow's paper.

08:59.100 --> 09:01.080
"I, Sir Walter De Souza,
renounce any opposition

09:01.100 --> 09:05.080
"to my fellow LCC member Miss Cobden
and her works".

09:05.100 --> 09:06.100
The original?

09:09.100 --> 09:13.100
How I am your friend, Mr Reid.

09:16.100 --> 09:19.080
Mr Best. I wonder,
have you ever met Mr Urwin?

09:19.100 --> 09:22.080
I have not had the pleasure, sir.

09:22.100 --> 09:24.080
But I am an admirer of your work.

09:24.100 --> 09:27.080
Mr Urwin is perhaps the last
remaining night-soil man

09:27.100 --> 09:29.100
of this parish.

09:31.100 --> 09:33.100
Good evening to you, inspector.

09:35.100 --> 09:37.080
Hop it, Jimmy.

09:37.100 --> 09:43.080
We must assume his female captors
to have forced this retraction

09:43.100 --> 09:46.080
of his opposition to Miss Cobden.
A Miss in the London County Council?

09:46.100 --> 09:48.080
How this city continues to evolve.

09:48.100 --> 09:52.080
It's a novelty, yes,
but her reputation grows.

09:52.100 --> 09:54.080
Over 2,000 votes collected in '89.

09:54.100 --> 09:56.080
Yet more side with her now.

09:56.100 --> 09:57.080
What exactly is this opposition

09:57.100 --> 10:00.080
they seek to end with this
declaration of De Souza's?

10:00.100 --> 10:02.080
De Souza has never hidden
his bile from Cobden,

10:02.100 --> 10:04.080
or indeed any woman
that seeks office.

10:04.100 --> 10:07.080
The first time she voted
in the LCC, February this year,

10:07.100 --> 10:09.080
he served her with a writ.
Blocked her right to do so again.

10:09.100 --> 10:12.080
And there is more.
If he wins his court case,

10:12.100 --> 10:14.080
her actions will be prosecuted
as illegal.

10:14.100 --> 10:16.080
Drake, send word to Cobden's office.

10:16.100 --> 10:19.100
In the meantime, any and all
we have on the woman.

10:20.100 --> 10:24.080
You weren't being kind,
about the music hall?

10:24.100 --> 10:26.100
Come, Rose - you know I am not that.

10:29.100 --> 10:31.100
Who'd have thought it, though.

10:32.100 --> 10:34.080
A man snatched,

10:34.100 --> 10:36.100
the police arriving...

10:38.100 --> 10:39.100
Sergeant Drake.

10:41.100 --> 10:43.100
He seem his self to you?

10:44.100 --> 10:46.080
Happy?

10:46.100 --> 10:48.080
Bella meets a need.

10:48.100 --> 10:51.080
A need you would not.

10:51.100 --> 10:53.080
You mistake my meaning, Miss Susan.

10:53.100 --> 10:58.080
I wish the pair a, a happy union -
the happiest.

10:58.100 --> 11:00.080
Come in.

11:00.100 --> 11:03.080
Forgive me intruding. My night's
takings here for counting.

11:03.100 --> 11:06.080
Rose, meet Ida,
newest to our home here.

11:06.100 --> 11:08.080
But fastest to our gentlemen's
hearts already.

11:08.100 --> 11:11.080
Well, I should leave you
to your business.

11:11.100 --> 11:13.100
I would not get in the way
of Miss Susan's profits.

11:16.100 --> 11:18.100
(I'm proud of you, girl.)

11:22.100 --> 11:24.080
Your new thoroughbred?

11:24.100 --> 11:26.100
Not near so sleek and lovely
as you, darling.

11:28.100 --> 11:29.100
Captain.

11:32.100 --> 11:34.080
Captain. One for you, two for me

11:34.100 --> 11:36.100
and 20 for the barber,
Silas Duggan.

11:38.100 --> 11:40.100
Would you leave us, please?
Yes, Miss Susan.

11:42.100 --> 11:46.080
You think it wise to air your
weary gripes in front of that girl?

11:46.100 --> 11:48.080
I just think she should know
who she's working for.

11:48.100 --> 11:50.080
So says the police stooge.

11:50.100 --> 11:54.080
Yeah, at least it's honest coin.
No! That's an honest pittance.

11:54.100 --> 11:56.080
That does nothing - NOTHING -

11:56.100 --> 11:58.080
to address our currently
calamitous situation.

11:58.100 --> 12:02.080
Oh, yeah, and whose fault is that
current calamitous situation, Susan?

12:02.100 --> 12:04.080
Hmm?

12:04.100 --> 12:07.080
Who was it did the goddamn deal
with Duggan, huh?

12:07.100 --> 12:08.100
Was it me?

12:49.100 --> 12:52.100
There you are, sir.
Thank you.

13:00.100 --> 13:04.080
You are not yet due, madam.
Should I be flattered?

13:04.100 --> 13:08.080
No.
I come with a business proposition.

13:08.100 --> 13:13.080
Indeed. Tenter Street is a concern
that makes money. Good money.

13:13.100 --> 13:18.080
I'm aware of this. Then take it. Buy
it from me.

13:18.100 --> 13:21.080
But it's already mine.

13:21.100 --> 13:23.100
The premises are yours,
but the business is mine.

13:26.100 --> 13:30.080
There would be no outlay for you,
other than a fee for my discharge -

13:30.100 --> 13:33.080
on which you and I might agree,
and which may provide for

13:33.100 --> 13:36.080
my husband and myself to remove
ourselves from this quarter.

13:36.100 --> 13:38.080
It is a good and generous offer,
Duggan.

13:38.100 --> 13:43.100
It's true, the house was a pigpen
when I gave you tenancy of it.

13:44.100 --> 13:48.100
That house, that income
may now be entirely yours.

13:50.100 --> 13:52.080
It will be mine - in due course.

13:52.100 --> 13:55.080
Only should I fail to make payment.

13:55.100 --> 13:57.080
Oh...

13:57.100 --> 14:01.080
but you will fail,
one month or the next.

14:01.100 --> 14:03.100
Duggan, please.

14:04.100 --> 14:07.080
I have made you money. Much money.

14:07.100 --> 14:10.080
Now...

14:10.100 --> 14:13.080
I beg you, free me.

14:13.100 --> 14:18.100
But Madam, you may with ease be free.
You have always known this.

14:20.100 --> 14:25.080
Come - is an act from which, as you
say, you have readily profited,

14:25.100 --> 14:27.100
yet will not perform yourself.

14:30.100 --> 14:33.100
Some might call that hypocrisy.

14:47.100 --> 14:50.100
Fresh bread,
baked this morning!

14:59.100 --> 15:01.080
There are places nearby
where you can get a hot meals
and a cold drink.

15:01.100 --> 15:03.100
Thank you, Miss.
God bless you.

15:07.100 --> 15:10.080
Turkish, sir.
Ground with a burr-mill,

15:10.100 --> 15:13.080
sugared and blended and akin to tar.

15:13.100 --> 15:16.080
My thanks, Artherton.
I just saw the damnedest thing.

15:16.100 --> 15:18.080
This woman I just
passed in the street.

15:18.100 --> 15:21.080
No, scratch that,
she was not a woman.

15:21.100 --> 15:23.080
Uh-huh. She was a goddess, Reid,

15:23.100 --> 15:24.080
to make even a heathen like you
believe.

15:24.100 --> 15:26.080
What are we to make of this,
Sergeant?

15:26.100 --> 15:28.080
Another blend for the American,
I imagine.

15:28.100 --> 15:32.080
You should have seen her,
she had gentle eyes, perfect face.

15:32.100 --> 15:35.080
And the body that one imagines under
the... Yes. Thank you, Captain.

15:35.100 --> 15:38.100
Oh, no, please...
Do continue on, sir.

15:42.100 --> 15:44.080
I apologise, Councillor Cobden.

15:44.100 --> 15:47.080
He is American and therefore
lacking in manners and propriety.

15:47.100 --> 15:50.080
Well, then, we shall get along
famously.

15:50.100 --> 15:52.100
Inspector Reid, I take it?

15:59.100 --> 16:03.100
You cannot think me a suspect
in Sir Walter's disappearance?

16:05.100 --> 16:08.080
I was with my political agent.

16:08.100 --> 16:11.080
He can act as my witness if my word
is not good enough for you.

16:11.100 --> 16:14.080
No, it is not you, but your
supporters we are interested in.

16:14.100 --> 16:16.080
For once, the papers bear no lies.

16:16.100 --> 16:20.080
We believe a gang of women did act
in your name in snatching De Souza.

16:20.100 --> 16:22.080
Do you know an Ettie Lee?

16:22.100 --> 16:25.080
No. Did you incite any woman
to action against De Souza?

16:25.100 --> 16:28.080
To do so would be self murder.
How so?

16:28.100 --> 16:32.080
Sir Walter's capture looks set to
ruin me. The court case approaches.

16:32.100 --> 16:33.080
If he is not found, is not safe,

16:33.100 --> 16:36.080
I will have lost
before I have even begun.

16:36.100 --> 16:38.080
I made a promise to my voters,
Inspector.

16:38.100 --> 16:40.080
I want to see it through.

16:40.100 --> 16:43.080
And yet they would darken your name
with this criminal act.

16:43.100 --> 16:45.080
Do not think the irony lost on me.

16:45.100 --> 16:50.080
Tell me, what kind of woman
supports you. What unites them?

16:50.100 --> 16:53.080
That they work. Or they have work
stolen from them.

16:53.100 --> 16:56.080
That they are mistreated by the men
who employ them,

16:56.100 --> 16:59.080
ignored,
dismissed without due cause,

16:59.100 --> 17:03.080
spoken over, used for carnal
pursuits, dispossessed.

17:03.100 --> 17:06.079
The ill-used women of this city
could number an army.

17:06.099 --> 17:07.079
They start with a gang.

17:07.099 --> 17:11.079
Tell me, do you keep record of
those who seek assistance from you?

17:11.099 --> 17:14.079
It makes me feel quite the dullard,
but yes.

17:14.099 --> 17:17.079
Then I would have you
share it with me, Councillor.

17:17.099 --> 17:18.079
Will you have them sent over?

17:18.099 --> 17:22.079
So, I am to be deputised to you?

17:22.099 --> 17:24.099
I...

17:37.100 --> 17:42.100
What's this? "Do I qualify for
badge and warrant card now?"

17:45.100 --> 17:47.080
You men. Fast eyes through these,
if you please.

17:47.100 --> 17:50.080
We search for women
with both heavy grievance

17:50.100 --> 17:52.100
and frequent communication
with Miss Cobden.

17:54.100 --> 17:57.080
Let's get to it, Sergeant. Sir.

18:13.100 --> 18:15.080
Both men asked for Miss Ida.

18:15.100 --> 18:17.080
Said they would pay over and above.

18:21.100 --> 18:25.080
Good evening to you, sir. Madam.

18:25.100 --> 18:28.080
Miss Ida. Thrice in one week.

18:28.100 --> 18:31.080
We are flattered.

18:31.100 --> 18:35.100
Ida, show your gentleman
to your room. Yes, Miss Susan.

18:44.100 --> 18:46.080
That man has had my very best.

18:46.100 --> 18:48.080
First Rose, then Bella,

18:48.100 --> 18:51.080
and neither could lay claim
to such regular loyalty.

18:51.100 --> 18:55.100
Along with you, girl.
See to refreshments.

19:30.100 --> 19:31.100
Charity!

19:32.100 --> 19:36.100
Charity, fetch a broom.
Yes, Miss Susan.

19:39.100 --> 19:41.080
Ida,
why are you not with your
gentleman?

19:41.100 --> 19:44.080
The gent has particular tastes,
Miss Susan.

19:44.100 --> 19:47.080
You wish me to accommodate,
do you not?

19:47.100 --> 19:50.080
No. I would speak with him myself.

19:50.100 --> 19:54.080
I do not allow all
and every behaviour under my roof.

19:54.100 --> 19:57.100
Please, Miss.
I made sure to charge extra.

20:02.100 --> 20:03.100
Who are you?

20:05.100 --> 20:06.100
What have you done?

20:35.100 --> 20:39.080
Help! Help, sir!

20:39.100 --> 20:41.080
Please, help!

20:41.100 --> 20:45.080
What is it girl? Miss Susan.
Tenter Street,

20:45.100 --> 20:47.080
she's been taken.

20:47.100 --> 20:50.100
Perkins! Fetch Jackson!

20:51.100 --> 20:53.080
Where?

20:53.100 --> 20:56.080
Where? Ida's room.

20:56.100 --> 20:58.100
Miss Charity...

21:00.100 --> 21:04.080
What's happened to Miss Susan? Go!

21:04.100 --> 21:06.080
Look, this is her earring.

21:06.100 --> 21:08.080
Won by myself at dice.

21:08.100 --> 21:11.100
Charity, what did you see here?
What happened?

21:13.100 --> 21:15.080
Miss Susan...taken, sir.

21:15.100 --> 21:17.080
I gathered that, girl, but by
who, goddamit?

21:17.100 --> 21:18.080
Which of these sons of bitches...?

21:18.100 --> 21:21.080
Jackson, will you just give
the girl some peace?

21:21.100 --> 21:24.080
What's this, Sergeant? Another
mewling tart for you to defend?

21:24.100 --> 21:26.080
Captain, Captain, gather yourself.
Look...

21:26.100 --> 21:29.080
I do not know any man
who would spirit a woman away

21:29.100 --> 21:32.080
into the night without first
taking his clothes.

21:32.100 --> 21:36.080
See here? Violence used
to take whoever lay here.

21:36.100 --> 21:38.080
Now...

21:38.100 --> 21:40.080
who was it entertained here, girl?

21:40.100 --> 21:43.080
Miss Ida, sir. Our new girl.

21:43.100 --> 21:45.080
And she is here?

21:45.100 --> 21:47.080
No. Disappeared also, sir.

21:47.100 --> 21:49.100
Calm, now, who did you see?

21:52.100 --> 21:53.080
I was in the parlour.

21:53.100 --> 21:57.100
A brick came through the window
there when I was sweeping up.

21:58.100 --> 22:00.080
But...

22:00.100 --> 22:01.080
I saw them.

22:01.100 --> 22:05.080
The man and Miss Susan
carried between them.

22:05.100 --> 22:07.080
Stowed aboard a cart
of some kind, sir.

22:07.100 --> 22:10.080
But Ida herself
was not so mistreated.

22:10.100 --> 22:11.100
No, Captain Jackson.

22:12.100 --> 22:15.080
She walked alongside.

22:15.100 --> 22:17.080
Similar method, is it not?

22:17.100 --> 22:19.080
Like De Souza and the girl Ettie
who worked there.

22:19.100 --> 22:22.080
The brick, through the window,
a distraction also,

22:22.100 --> 22:25.080
as with the blackout at Blewett's.
The same means of escape.

22:25.100 --> 22:28.100
The same gang of women, must be?
And Susan just got in their way.

22:31.100 --> 22:33.080
Look, there's some dirt here.

22:33.100 --> 22:37.080
This man - the client - this man
is the target, the purpose.

22:37.100 --> 22:39.080
His name, Charity?

22:39.100 --> 22:41.080
We all look to our own, sir.

22:41.100 --> 22:44.100
His face is known to me,
but...his name is not.

22:46.100 --> 22:48.100
But others have known him
in the past.

22:51.100 --> 22:54.100
Miss Rose and, er...Mrs Drake.

22:57.100 --> 23:01.080
We must have them both interviewed.
If you would, er...

23:01.100 --> 23:03.100
permit me to interview your wife,
Sergeant.

23:28.100 --> 23:33.080
You... Wait! Forgive me, Miss Susan.
No harm was meant to come your way.

23:33.100 --> 23:35.080
She wakes then?

23:35.100 --> 23:39.100
I would have audience with
you myself. Raine, my name.

23:56.100 --> 23:59.080
I knew I liked the measure of you,
first I had eyes on you.

23:59.100 --> 24:01.100
Now, all the more.

24:07.100 --> 24:10.080
Do not force me
to make you prisoner.

24:10.100 --> 24:12.080
Friend is much more to my liking.
Friend?!

24:12.100 --> 24:16.080
I am attacked in my house, abducted,
and brought to this hovel.

24:16.100 --> 24:18.080
My girls.

24:18.100 --> 24:23.080
If any one of them are harmed,
I shall slice you lip to tip.

24:23.100 --> 24:25.080
Your premises was all
that was required.

24:25.100 --> 24:29.080
Premises! My business!
Now ruined. Word will spread.

24:29.100 --> 24:32.100
Which man will now
trust in the security of my house?

24:34.100 --> 24:38.080
You do not need such as Ely.

24:38.100 --> 24:42.080
His deeds are evil, as is the man.

24:42.100 --> 24:44.080
You think I have no knowledge
of evil men?

24:44.100 --> 24:46.080
Or care either which
way for their deeds?

24:46.100 --> 24:48.080
You care for this, then?

24:48.100 --> 24:49.100
Mags.

25:04.100 --> 25:05.080
Ely the cause.

25:05.100 --> 25:08.100
He might as well have
done it to her himself.

25:14.100 --> 25:15.100
Come...

25:32.100 --> 25:36.100
Mrs Drake. Good morning.
My many thanks.

25:37.100 --> 25:39.080
Study each item in turn.

25:39.100 --> 25:41.080
If we can establish the identity of
the client,

25:41.100 --> 25:44.080
it may help us discover
Miss Hart's whereabouts.

25:44.100 --> 25:47.100
I set eyes on that bitch Ida, I'll
smash her teeth through her jaw.

25:54.100 --> 25:55.080
Shined.

25:55.100 --> 25:57.100
Regular like.

25:58.100 --> 25:59.100
Gutteridge?

26:03.100 --> 26:05.100
Liked to see his face in his toecap.

26:06.100 --> 26:09.100
But he were a big man...
and this boot too small.

26:14.100 --> 26:16.100
Hitchley?

26:19.100 --> 26:21.100
Liked to smoke throughout,
did he not?

26:26.100 --> 26:28.080
Eridge.

26:28.100 --> 26:29.080
Remember?

26:29.100 --> 26:30.080
Haughty.

26:30.100 --> 26:33.100
Always wished to, you know,
finish...

26:35.100 --> 26:36.100
..not inside as such.

26:38.100 --> 26:40.100
Said we was all riddled.

26:43.100 --> 26:44.080
Mrs Drake?

26:44.100 --> 26:47.080
No. See the embroidery.

26:47.100 --> 26:50.100
Eridge wasn't the kind for flowers.

26:51.100 --> 26:52.080
Ely.

26:52.100 --> 26:54.080
Ely.

26:54.100 --> 26:55.080
Cruel.

26:55.100 --> 26:57.080
Thomas Ely.

26:57.100 --> 26:59.080
His home? His work?

26:59.100 --> 27:00.100
Lawyerman.

27:02.100 --> 27:06.100
My dear Bella, you are brave.
You do know that, don't ya?

27:08.100 --> 27:10.100
I shall see you tonight, husband.

27:14.100 --> 27:15.080
Rose.

27:15.100 --> 27:16.100
Mrs Drake.

27:19.100 --> 27:21.100
Sergeant. Miss Rose.

27:26.100 --> 27:28.080
We have a politician, a lawyer.

27:28.100 --> 27:32.080
Men of influence snatched
unsuspecting from their daily
pursuits

27:32.100 --> 27:34.080
by a gang of women,
one of whose number may be planted

27:34.100 --> 27:36.080
amongst those activities.

27:36.100 --> 27:38.080
We may not assume
De Souza their first.

27:38.100 --> 27:41.080
So we must search the city's
crimes for one similar.

27:41.100 --> 27:44.080
One which may show us where this
plotting began. Artherton, Jackson,

27:44.100 --> 27:47.080
he studies the soil stamped into the
Tenter Street carpeting, does he not?

27:47.100 --> 27:50.080
He pursues it still, sir.
Delicate work.

27:50.100 --> 27:52.100
Very well.
Sergeant, you are with me.

27:56.100 --> 27:58.080
Ah, we have another, sir.

27:58.100 --> 28:00.080
Two weeks back. C Division.

28:00.100 --> 28:02.080
A gentleman snatched
from his lunchtime stroll

28:02.100 --> 28:04.080
through a department store.

28:04.100 --> 28:06.080
A fire set off, their distraction -
a dresser girl, their insider,

28:06.100 --> 28:08.080
she also then disappeared.

28:08.100 --> 28:09.080
Cullington. His work?

28:09.100 --> 28:11.080
Yes, sir. Factory foreman.

28:11.100 --> 28:13.080
Not quite a lawyer or a politician.

28:13.100 --> 28:14.080
No. Which factory?

28:14.100 --> 28:17.080
The Covent Garden shoe-makers.

28:17.100 --> 28:19.080
Before that, however... What?

28:19.100 --> 28:21.080
..the match factory at Bow.

28:21.100 --> 28:23.080
Cullington left after the strike
in '88.

28:23.100 --> 28:26.080
The match-girls strike.
Quite so, sir.

28:26.100 --> 28:28.080
During the picket, Cullington acted
as barrier

28:28.100 --> 28:30.080
between the women and the owners.

28:30.100 --> 28:31.080
After the settlement,

28:31.100 --> 28:34.080
it was felt he no longer had
the support of the workforce.
The match-girls.

28:34.100 --> 28:39.080
The match-girls. Show me a group
of women more ill used
than the match-girls.

28:39.100 --> 28:41.080
Miss Cobden.

28:41.100 --> 28:45.080
Miss Cobden,
she is committed to those girls.

28:45.100 --> 28:50.100
To answering their grievances, even
though their strike is now past.

28:52.100 --> 28:54.080
Phossy jaw! Necrosis of the jawbone.

28:54.100 --> 28:57.080
The phosphorous
from the yellow-tipped matches

28:57.100 --> 29:00.080
converts into biphosphonates -
these laid down in the bone

29:00.100 --> 29:04.080
to then eat it away. Abscesses lead
to brain inflammation, then mutism.

29:04.100 --> 29:06.080
Then death.
The Jimson in those smokes.

29:06.100 --> 29:08.080
Taken for pain relief.

29:08.100 --> 29:09.080
Deputations from match-girls.

29:09.100 --> 29:12.080
Here, "They have been trying
to get the poor girls to say

29:12.100 --> 29:15.080
"that it is all lies and has been
printed and trying to make us

29:15.100 --> 29:17.080
"sign papers that it's all lies."

29:17.100 --> 29:20.080
Papers. Legal papers.
Ely, the lawyer.

29:20.100 --> 29:21.080
Papers prepared by him, perhaps?

29:21.100 --> 29:24.080
That is the means by which the
strike was laid to rest, sir.

29:24.100 --> 29:28.080
The girls were manipulated into
silence, promised improvements
in their conditions.

29:28.100 --> 29:31.080
But these improvements so scant
that Miss Cobden, others like her,

29:31.100 --> 29:34.080
some of the girls even too, refused
to accept this change in provision.

29:34.100 --> 29:37.080
And here is De Souza all set to
bring Miss Cobden to heel and
silence her.

29:37.100 --> 29:40.080
Cullington - the foreman who refused
to hear their complaints,

29:40.100 --> 29:41.080
Ely to serve legal writ,

29:41.100 --> 29:45.080
De Souza to silence their champion.
Sergeant, travel to Bow.

29:45.100 --> 29:47.080
Find that factory manager,

29:47.100 --> 29:50.080
hang him by his ankles over one of
his dipping vats and have from him

29:50.100 --> 29:54.080
the roll of girls that refused to
accept his scant settlement.

29:54.100 --> 29:56.080
Sir.

29:56.100 --> 29:59.080
We are nearing the root
and reason of this.

29:59.100 --> 30:00.100
Flight, fetch me coffee.

30:02.100 --> 30:03.100
Go on.

30:38.100 --> 30:41.080
Raine!

30:41.100 --> 30:43.100
What game is this, young lady?!

30:44.100 --> 30:46.100
Hide and seek.

30:50.100 --> 30:53.080
See?

30:53.100 --> 30:57.100
You are not alone in wishing your
girls a better measure of living.

30:59.100 --> 31:01.100
Here, they feel part of a family.

31:03.100 --> 31:04.100
They are thieves.

31:07.100 --> 31:10.080
What is this improved life
you promise?

31:10.100 --> 31:12.080
One lived behind bars?

31:12.100 --> 31:16.100
One of freedom...compassion.

31:17.100 --> 31:19.080
These girls have been

31:19.100 --> 31:22.100
saved from slavery and disease
and given a place...

31:24.100 --> 31:26.080
..a voice.

31:26.100 --> 31:30.080
I insist on everything that was
never insisted upon for me.

31:30.100 --> 31:37.080
Education of the self, control
of the self, respect of the self.

31:37.100 --> 31:40.080
Rebuilding what was ruined.

31:40.100 --> 31:45.080
Here they are turned to no-one's
account but their own. You!

31:45.100 --> 31:48.080
You would have them
spread-legging your service

31:48.100 --> 31:50.100
and pocket your 60%.

31:51.100 --> 31:54.080
My girls are treated
better than any.

31:54.100 --> 31:57.080
In my care they are tended to
when sick, have as much security

31:57.100 --> 32:00.080
as might be afforded them
anywhere in this world!

32:00.100 --> 32:01.100
And who profits?

32:03.100 --> 32:05.080
It is my business.

32:05.100 --> 32:09.080
You think yourself a woman liberated
and independent.

32:09.100 --> 32:11.080
I do.

32:11.100 --> 32:15.080
And what of the men who
leave your house loose and sated?

32:15.100 --> 32:18.080
Do you think on them
and what they have enjoyed

32:18.100 --> 32:21.100
so that you can proclaim
your liberation?

32:28.100 --> 32:30.080
Come with me.

32:35.100 --> 32:37.080
I've been wounded.

32:37.100 --> 32:40.100
There was a letter-knife
in the bedroom.

32:41.100 --> 32:42.100
Ely used it.

32:45.100 --> 32:47.100
A needle and thread, there.

32:49.100 --> 32:50.080
You will oblige me?

32:50.100 --> 32:52.100
I am not one of your mulish girls.

32:53.100 --> 32:56.100
But I cannot ask one of my girls.

32:59.100 --> 33:00.100
I am their leader.

33:01.100 --> 33:04.100
They may not see me so...mortal.

33:07.100 --> 33:08.100
Perhaps you understand?

33:27.100 --> 33:29.100
Your hand is steady.

33:43.100 --> 33:44.100
You wonder at my scars.

33:47.100 --> 33:48.100
First was a carriage.

33:51.100 --> 33:52.080
Same...

33:52.100 --> 33:58.080
one that took my mother
from this world.

33:58.100 --> 34:01.080
Left me
with nothing but my infant sister,

34:01.100 --> 34:03.080
Ma held in her arms.

34:03.100 --> 34:08.080
The rest - must a woman explain
how she came by such...

34:08.100 --> 34:09.100
stripes?

34:13.100 --> 34:14.100
By the hands of men.

34:17.100 --> 34:19.100
Your sister.
Is she still amongst you?

34:20.100 --> 34:21.100
She is not.

34:24.100 --> 34:27.100
She helped build this, however.

34:31.100 --> 34:32.100
This kingdom of ours.

34:36.100 --> 34:37.100
You've made all this.

34:39.100 --> 34:41.100
You started with nothing.

34:42.100 --> 34:45.100
I started with everything,
and yet nothing is my own.

34:46.100 --> 34:49.100
Not such the independent woman,
then?

34:51.100 --> 34:52.100
No.

34:54.100 --> 34:57.100
Many's the woman
who has come down here...

35:00.100 --> 35:03.100
..and had her vision
of the world changed.

35:05.100 --> 35:07.100
What will it take to
change your vision of the world?

35:09.100 --> 35:12.080
These men you have taken.

35:12.100 --> 35:14.080
The revenge you seek.

35:14.100 --> 35:17.080
Everything your sister
and yourself have built up -

35:17.100 --> 35:19.100
it will drive it into the dirt.

35:28.100 --> 35:29.100
How dare you speak of her?

35:33.100 --> 35:37.100
What do you know of her?!

35:38.100 --> 35:39.080
I didn't mean...

35:39.100 --> 35:42.080
Or me. Of what we do here!

35:42.100 --> 35:46.100
You - a woman that runs whores!

35:47.100 --> 35:51.080
No. I will not brook
any more from you!

35:51.100 --> 35:52.080
Mags!

35:52.100 --> 35:55.080
You have no wish to be our friend?

35:55.100 --> 35:58.100
I shall use you for another purpose.

35:59.100 --> 36:03.080
May I introduce Sir Walter De Souza?

36:03.100 --> 36:05.080
Mr Thomas Ely, you already know.

36:05.100 --> 36:07.100
And Mr Henry Cullington.

36:09.100 --> 36:11.080
Raine, what are you doing?

36:15.100 --> 36:18.100
Raine, stop, please! Please!

36:21.100 --> 36:23.080
No, Raine please,
I beg you, think of what you do!

36:37.100 --> 36:39.100
The world will hear us now.

36:51.100 --> 36:53.080
What will they make of you?

36:53.100 --> 36:56.080
For surely a day will come
when not only one woman -

36:56.100 --> 37:01.080
but hundreds will take their
fully-enfranchised position

37:01.100 --> 37:03.080
among you
and none shall remark on it

37:03.100 --> 37:08.080
as anything more than the everyday
heartbeat of political life.

37:08.100 --> 37:13.080
Bluntly, sirs - if you are for
progress, then you are for me!

37:13.100 --> 37:18.080
Forgive the intrusion, it is
born only out of necessity.

37:18.100 --> 37:20.080
Sir Walter?

37:20.100 --> 37:21.080
I'm afraid not, but we are close.

37:21.100 --> 37:25.080
Here, madam - it is a list of
all the women from the match factory

37:25.100 --> 37:27.080
who refused settlement
for their grievances.

37:27.100 --> 37:29.080
The match-girls? Mmm.

37:29.100 --> 37:32.080
You believe they are responsible
for the man's abduction?

37:32.100 --> 37:33.080
And not just the one man, miss.

37:33.100 --> 37:36.100
Please. The names on the list,
do any seem familiar to you?

37:38.100 --> 37:40.100
Here, Agnes Thornell.

37:41.100 --> 37:43.080
She came to me with her head
and shoulders

37:43.100 --> 37:46.080
entirely obscured with black lace -
mourning weeds.

37:46.100 --> 37:48.080
My thanks. We will find her.

37:48.100 --> 37:50.080
You will not succeed, Inspector.

37:50.100 --> 37:52.080
The poor woman
died of her phossy jaw.

37:52.100 --> 37:56.080
Her visits to you, was she alone?

37:56.100 --> 38:02.080
No. She led a faction.
She and another firebrand.

38:02.100 --> 38:04.100
Well, after Agnes died,
I never saw her again.

38:06.100 --> 38:09.080
But I always fancied
a familial closeness.

38:09.100 --> 38:11.080
Familial?

38:11.100 --> 38:16.080
Ah, here, another Thornell.
Raine. Raine Thornell.

38:16.100 --> 38:19.100
Thank you again, Miss Cobden,
good evening.

38:21.100 --> 38:22.080
Raine Thornell...

38:22.100 --> 38:24.080
Nothing. Not a single record.

38:24.100 --> 38:26.100
The wit and resilience
to evade the law at every turn.

38:28.100 --> 38:31.100
Miss Susan!
I have word for you, Inspector.

38:34.100 --> 38:36.080
Jackson? We have sent for him, sir.

38:36.100 --> 38:38.100
Sit down. I'll get you a drink.

38:43.100 --> 38:44.100
Jesus! Susan!

38:45.100 --> 38:47.080
What did they do to you, darling?

38:47.100 --> 38:50.080
Captain, a moment.
These are from separate men?

38:50.100 --> 38:51.100
Not now, Reid. Captain.

38:52.100 --> 38:55.080
Three right-handed index
fingers. Cut through

38:55.100 --> 38:58.080
the digital artery...

38:58.100 --> 39:01.080
There is word. "Have the woman Hart
carry this bag

39:01.100 --> 39:04.080
"filled with the ransom
of 500 guineas compensation

39:04.100 --> 39:07.080
"to Petticoat Lane, tomorrow at
four o'clock in the afternoon.

39:07.100 --> 39:09.080
"If neither, she, nor the bag,
nor the money are there,

39:09.100 --> 39:13.080
"Masters Cullington, de Souza and Ely
will die."

39:13.100 --> 39:15.100
Where are they hid, Miss Hart?

39:18.100 --> 39:20.080
My eyes were bound. I have no idea.

39:20.100 --> 39:22.080
You have no clue?!

39:22.100 --> 39:24.080
Hey - she answered you already,
Reid.

39:24.100 --> 39:25.100
Let me fix you up.

39:50.100 --> 39:53.080
500 guineas. The notion of
De Souza's imminent death

39:53.100 --> 39:55.080
oiled the wheels somewhat.

39:55.100 --> 39:58.080
Along with my word to the
Commissioner that it would not

39:58.100 --> 40:01.080
leave my sight. This division
does not bow to ransom demands.

40:01.100 --> 40:03.080
But we may allow ourselves
the pretence of doing so.

40:03.100 --> 40:05.080
And how exactly do you
intend to hand it off?

40:05.100 --> 40:07.080
As was requested.

40:07.100 --> 40:08.080
Absolutely not! Goddamn it!

40:08.100 --> 40:09.100
She's not going
anywhere except home.

40:11.100 --> 40:13.080
Does he speak for you?

40:13.100 --> 40:14.100
He has never yet.

40:16.100 --> 40:17.100
No. Well...?

40:19.100 --> 40:20.100
I shall do it.

40:22.100 --> 40:24.080
What the hell are you doing?
You call me his stooge!

40:24.100 --> 40:25.080
Why are you doing this for him?!

40:25.100 --> 40:29.080
I am not doing it for him.
I do it for them.

40:29.100 --> 40:31.080
Those girls.

40:31.100 --> 40:33.080
Because perhaps this way
they might find a way through this

40:33.100 --> 40:35.100
that does not involve a man
and a rope.

40:39.100 --> 40:43.080
Ourselves and the Captain,
we will be hidden in plain sight,

40:43.100 --> 40:44.080
alert to your safety.

40:44.100 --> 40:47.080
You will hand the bag to Raine
and then you will turn about

40:47.100 --> 40:51.080
and you will leave. And then we
shall follow her to wherever it is

40:51.100 --> 40:54.080
they hide and only then, strike.

40:54.100 --> 40:56.100
Retrieve both cash and captives.

40:57.100 --> 41:00.080
If those men are alive,
those women will avoid the hangman.

41:00.100 --> 41:01.100
You have my word.

42:09.100 --> 42:11.100
You ARE a dutiful girl.

42:23.100 --> 42:26.080
Raine, whatever your plan,
be wise, think again.

42:26.100 --> 42:28.080
The police will take you.

42:28.100 --> 42:32.080
You're guilty of kidnap, ransom -
your girls all of them complicit.

42:32.100 --> 42:34.080
Please, I would not see you all
hang.

42:34.100 --> 42:39.100
You would do better to have
a little faith in womankind.

44:17.100 --> 44:20.100
Wait! Get off me! Get off me!
You, stay there. You, stay there!

45:12.100 --> 45:14.100
You did not call out to the police.

45:15.100 --> 45:17.080
I did not.

45:17.100 --> 45:19.080
I would help you and yours.

45:19.100 --> 45:22.080
Plenty enough girls to look to.

45:22.100 --> 45:24.080
I do not require another.

45:24.100 --> 45:29.080
But I come as your equal -
your friend, not your charge.

45:29.100 --> 45:31.080
Why would you want my life?

45:31.100 --> 45:36.100
Because perhaps now, I see
beneath the surface of my life.

45:38.100 --> 45:41.080
I take orders from a man
to come here.

45:41.100 --> 45:44.080
I service the needs of another
I call husband.

45:44.100 --> 45:45.100
And yet there is another still...

45:47.100 --> 45:49.100
a man - Duggan - who owns me.

45:51.100 --> 45:54.080
No other soul
have I shared this with.

45:54.100 --> 45:58.100
He seeks to trade my debt
for my flesh.

46:01.100 --> 46:03.100
Whatever comes to pass...

46:06.100 --> 46:07.080
..you must swear it to yourself,

46:07.100 --> 46:10.100
that you will not cave in
to this animal's demands.

46:12.100 --> 46:14.080
The first time changes you...

46:14.100 --> 46:18.100
for ever. I would not
want that for you.

46:22.100 --> 46:24.080
Reid, I swear to God,
if anything happens to her...

46:24.100 --> 46:25.080
I swear! But what is it you fear?

46:25.100 --> 46:28.080
You saw the pair, same as I,
close in congress.

46:28.100 --> 46:30.080
And what exactly is your point?

46:30.100 --> 46:32.080
That too much of this story
still remains a mystery.

46:32.100 --> 46:34.080
One that you might still
have a hand in unravelling.

46:34.100 --> 46:38.080
Now muzzle your temper, Captain.
Return to your laboratory.

46:38.100 --> 46:39.100
That soil may yet lead us to her.

46:44.100 --> 46:47.080
Forgive us, Councillor,
we are somewhat pressed.

46:47.100 --> 46:50.080
As I can see, Inspector.
I merely wish to let you know

46:50.100 --> 46:52.080
that the woman Raine,

46:52.100 --> 46:54.080
I've a clue as to
where she might call home.

46:54.100 --> 46:56.080
Her sister, Agnes,

46:56.100 --> 46:58.080
I was not the first advocate
she sought out.

46:58.100 --> 46:59.080
She spoke bitterly
of her home parish

46:59.100 --> 47:02.080
where she might have expected
succour but received none.

47:02.100 --> 47:04.100
St John at Hackney, Inspector.

47:30.100 --> 47:33.100
Bow matchworks and surrounds.

47:35.100 --> 47:39.080
St John at Hackney. Thanks to
Miss Cobden, our search narrows.

47:39.100 --> 47:40.080
There are women
located in this section.

47:40.100 --> 47:42.080
The soil burned hard and fast.

47:42.100 --> 47:46.080
That means there's heavy residue
of organic matter within it - peat.

47:46.100 --> 47:48.080
Fossilised microscopic remains
throughout.

47:48.100 --> 47:51.080
That kind of dirt can only be
found in one place - marshland.

47:51.100 --> 47:53.080
Hackney Marshes. Flight, find Urwin,

47:53.100 --> 47:56.100
cover this stretch of ground
with him, find his cart. Yes, sir.

48:14.100 --> 48:16.080
Gather it up, girls.

48:16.100 --> 48:17.080
This is our compensation.

48:17.100 --> 48:19.100
We have won at last.

48:22.100 --> 48:23.080
We move out in the morning.

48:23.100 --> 48:26.100
Miss Susan, you're one of us now!

48:33.100 --> 48:36.080
For the first time in my life,
I am glad to catch this stench.

48:36.100 --> 48:39.080
Inspector, we have found the girls.
Are you sure? Urwin, is it your cart?

48:39.100 --> 48:40.080
Treated poorly, but, yes, mine.

48:40.100 --> 48:42.080
House on Gilpin Road.

48:42.100 --> 48:45.100
Artherton, fetch Captain Jackson.
Sir. Thank you, sir. Jimmy.

48:58.100 --> 49:00.080
Where's Raine? Have you seen her?

49:00.100 --> 49:01.100
She's gone downstairs.

49:06.100 --> 49:10.080
Raine? Raine?
Your girls wait on you.

49:10.100 --> 49:12.100
Come no further. I will be quick.

49:13.100 --> 49:14.100
This I do for my sister.

49:18.100 --> 49:23.100
You should have paid me heed.
Now you are party to this.

49:24.100 --> 49:27.080
You would kill them?
You will all hang.

49:27.100 --> 49:30.100
I care not. Not since Agnes.

49:32.100 --> 49:35.080
The rot did not stop at her jaw.

49:35.100 --> 49:40.080
It crept up into her brain,
into her skull, into who she was.

49:40.100 --> 49:44.080
Until she did not know even me.

49:44.100 --> 49:47.080
A sister yet stranger.

49:47.100 --> 49:51.080
I was supposed to
protect her. Always.

49:57.100 --> 50:01.080
You! Dare whimper like a child(!)

50:01.100 --> 50:05.080
You who would rob
my girls of every hope!

50:05.100 --> 50:06.100
No, no, no.

50:10.100 --> 50:11.100
I did not... Do not touch me!

50:13.100 --> 50:20.080
I know you understand me.

50:22.100 --> 50:24.100
When these men burn...

50:25.100 --> 50:29.100
you will, I hope, join us.

50:34.100 --> 50:35.100
Now!

50:40.100 --> 50:42.080
No! You would betray me?
You betray yourself.

50:42.100 --> 50:44.080
To the back door.

50:44.100 --> 50:47.080
This is not freedom.
Not for your girls. Not for you.

50:47.100 --> 50:49.080
This is blind violence -
the preserve of all those

50:49.100 --> 50:53.080
that have left their scars on your
back. You have become man, Raine.

50:53.100 --> 50:55.100
No! Don't tell me I am that!

51:06.100 --> 51:08.080
Give it up.

51:08.100 --> 51:09.100
Give it up!

51:15.100 --> 51:17.080
Jackson! Jackson!

51:17.100 --> 51:20.080
Where's Susan? Where's Susan?

51:24.100 --> 51:25.080
No!

51:25.100 --> 51:28.080
Tell me that I am not that!

51:28.100 --> 51:29.080
Tell me I am not that!

51:29.100 --> 51:31.080
(Cut them loose. Cut them loose.)

51:31.100 --> 51:34.100
(...If you kill them,
all here will hang.)

51:46.100 --> 51:47.100
(Cut them loose.)

52:03.100 --> 52:06.080
No! No, Raine...

52:11.100 --> 52:14.100
No, no...

52:15.100 --> 52:17.080
Hey, Susan? No...

52:17.100 --> 52:18.080
Susan?

52:18.100 --> 52:20.080
Don't touch me!

52:20.100 --> 52:22.100
No...

52:37.100 --> 52:39.080
Come here.

52:41.100 --> 52:43.080
I intend to protest this outrage

52:43.100 --> 52:46.080
to the very highest level -
to the Commissioner himself.

52:46.100 --> 52:51.080
Come to the station with me
and I will take a statement, sir.

53:02.100 --> 53:05.100
They killed her.
They killed Miss Raine.

53:11.100 --> 53:15.080
If I placed you in harm's way,
madam, I am sorry for it.

53:15.100 --> 53:18.080
What will happen to her girls?

53:18.100 --> 53:21.080
I shall do all I can
to speak for these women.

53:21.100 --> 53:23.080
They will not see the rope.

53:23.100 --> 53:26.080
But you, why did you run with her?

53:26.100 --> 53:32.100
Raine wanted the best
for those girls and so did I.

53:34.100 --> 53:38.080
Life - it singularly fails
to reward good intentions.

53:38.100 --> 53:42.100
We want something better for
ourselves, better for those we love.

53:43.100 --> 53:44.080
And then...

54:02.100 --> 54:06.080
The city, my readers and myself,
all are awash with

54:06.100 --> 54:10.080
relief at your return.
None more so than Miss Cobden,

54:10.100 --> 54:14.080
here at my behest.
A chance for rapprochement,

54:14.100 --> 54:17.100
and who better than The Star
to report it? The truce.

54:25.100 --> 54:28.080
This is how much damage women cause.

54:28.100 --> 54:32.080
But I would rather lose
each remaining finger

54:32.100 --> 54:33.100
than shake hands with her.

54:34.100 --> 54:37.080
Print a retraction of
the letter forced from me.

54:37.100 --> 54:40.080
My opposition to female
involvement in politics...

54:40.100 --> 54:43.080
Miss Cobden, do not think him
representative of all of us.

54:43.100 --> 54:45.080
Two more different men
I could not think of.

54:45.100 --> 54:48.080
Where Sir Walter is so consumed
with meanness, with revenge,

54:48.100 --> 54:52.080
you are a good man,
compassionate and right-headed.

54:52.100 --> 54:53.080
What does this mean for you?

54:53.100 --> 54:56.080
I rally my team,
fight the good fight -

54:56.100 --> 54:58.080
I think you rather know the drill.

54:58.100 --> 55:01.080
Continue on with his will so set
against you and you risk prison.

55:01.100 --> 55:04.100
At least I'd be under
your lock and key, Inspector.

55:06.100 --> 55:09.100
Forgive me, I am for ever in jest.

55:26.100 --> 55:27.100
Miss Susan?

55:30.100 --> 55:34.100
Come in, Rose. Come in, Rose.

55:43.100 --> 55:45.100
Oh, Miss Susan.

55:49.100 --> 55:51.080
You cannot imagine my relief

55:51.100 --> 55:53.100
to hear of your safe return.

55:54.100 --> 55:55.100
And...

55:57.100 --> 55:58.100
And happiness which...

56:00.100 --> 56:02.080
Well, is it true, Miss Susan,

56:02.100 --> 56:04.080
what Mr Blewett says,

56:04.100 --> 56:06.080
that you are to stand as my patron?

56:06.100 --> 56:08.100
I would have you close to me, Rose.

56:10.100 --> 56:12.080
Not owned yet again by another man

56:12.100 --> 56:15.080
whose only motives are for
his own enrichment, never your own.

56:15.100 --> 56:18.100
Then you are ever my saviour, Miss.

56:21.100 --> 56:25.080
(No, Rose. I was never that.)

56:50.100 --> 56:52.100
That woman... Raine.

56:56.100 --> 56:57.080
I couldn't see her intentions

56:57.100 --> 56:59.080
but she was a crazy woman, Susan.

56:59.100 --> 57:02.100
I saw her. I thought she was
going to take you from me.

57:05.100 --> 57:06.100
I thought...

57:10.100 --> 57:12.100
I thought I was saving you, darling.

57:19.100 --> 57:22.080
The water grows cold.
You want me to warm some up for you?

57:22.100 --> 57:24.080
Maybe fetch you some more towels?

57:24.100 --> 57:27.100
No. I want you to leave me in peace.

57:59.100 --> 58:02.080
Detective Flight's face is right,
his voice righter still.

58:02.100 --> 58:05.080
In the time available,
he's the best we have.

58:05.100 --> 58:06.080
Good morning, Lemonade.

58:06.100 --> 58:08.080
I'll take whiskey
from you now, miss.

58:08.100 --> 58:11.080
- What are you offering?
- You scare me.

58:11.100 --> 58:13.080
What do you call a dead Englishman?

58:13.100 --> 58:14.080
A good start.

58:14.100 --> 58:15.100
Police.

58:20.100 --> 58:21.100
There will be peace.
