00:24.608 --> 00:26.275
The refinery captain is
still not cooperating.

00:26.360 --> 00:30.071
And now, seven other container ships
are refusing to release their supplies.

00:30.322 --> 00:32.156
Frak this! I'm sending in the marines.

00:32.241 --> 00:34.701
TIGH: Tell them to get over
there and bring back the supplies.

00:34.785 --> 00:36.744
People, step back, all right?

00:36.829 --> 00:38.871
We're just here for
the supplies. All right?

00:38.956 --> 00:40.665
Stay out of our way,
and no one gets hurt.

Cease fire!
Cease fire!

00:46.839 --> 00:48.715
You shot people
for throwing coffee.

00:48.799 --> 00:50.174
The crowd was
out of control.

00:50.259 --> 00:52.135
Somebody took a shot.
I don't know who it was.

00:52.219 --> 00:54.011
Then all hell broke
loose. It was an accident.

00:54.179 --> 00:56.973
What do you want from
me, Helo? She's a Cylon.

00:58.016 --> 00:59.809
I'm not going to let you kill her. Okay?

01:00.185 --> 01:02.019
She's carrying
my child.

01:02.479 --> 01:03.688
I'm okay,
really.

01:03.772 --> 01:04.814
Yeah.

01:05.149 --> 01:07.108
It's just, I don't want
a baby born in a cell.

01:09.528 --> 01:12.780
People, just step back. Stay back,
all right? We just need some supplies.

01:12.865 --> 01:14.365
Get them back.
Get them back.

01:15.325 --> 01:16.951

discovered footage

01:30.007 --> 01:32.258
from what's become known
as the Gideon Massacre

01:32.342 --> 01:35.595
appears to show Galactica's
marines firing indiscriminately

01:35.679 --> 01:37.972
into a crowd of
unarmed civilians.

01:38.056 --> 01:39.807
Four dead, 12 wounded.

01:39.892 --> 01:42.685
And yet, as of today, not a
single charge has been filed

01:42.770 --> 01:46.397
against any of the marines involved,
nor their commanding officers.

01:46.482 --> 01:48.357
This is D'Anna Biers,

01:50.486 --> 01:52.695
D'ANNA: That's gonna
blow this thing wide open.

01:52.780 --> 01:55.323
We need some stock
footage of raging marines.

01:55.407 --> 01:57.241
We can intercut that with
the eyewitness statements.

You've no right to
come in here like this.

Ma'am, you're to come with us.

02:02.498 --> 02:03.623
What, am I
under arrest?

02:03.707 --> 02:04.749
No, ma'am.

02:06.710 --> 02:08.586
And what if
I refuse to go?

02:20.057 --> 02:21.599
Hello,
Miss Biers.

02:21.809 --> 02:24.143
It's nice to see you.
Welcome to Colonial One.

02:24.228 --> 02:26.229
Madam President,
it's an honor.

02:29.024 --> 02:30.149
Cmdr. Adama.

02:30.234 --> 02:31.275
Where did you get the tape?

02:34.071 --> 02:35.571
From an anonymous patriot.

02:37.324 --> 02:40.576
So, is this a social call or are
we on the verge of another coup?

02:41.036 --> 02:42.078
Funny.

02:43.497 --> 02:45.498
Just something
to break the ice.

02:47.417 --> 02:52.004
I take it I'm here because you are unhappy
with my story on the Gideon Massacre?

02:54.091 --> 02:56.884
What happened aboard
the Gideon was a tragedy.

02:57.636 --> 02:59.136
But it was not
a massacre.

02:59.221 --> 03:02.557
But the tape shows your men firing
into a crowd of defenseless civilians.

03:02.641 --> 03:04.267
My marines tell
a different story.

03:04.351 --> 03:05.434
Not to me.

03:06.395 --> 03:09.105
I've submitted a dozen
interview requests, all denied.

03:09.189 --> 03:10.898
Well, that's
about to change.

03:11.608 --> 03:14.944
You've been lobbying to do a
story on the Galactica for months.

03:15.028 --> 03:18.906
Cmdr. Adama has agreed to give you
unlimited access to his crew and his ship.

03:21.493 --> 03:24.120
That's right.
Unlimited access.

03:26.039 --> 03:28.249
All access won't buy you
a propaganda piece.

03:28.333 --> 03:29.792
We don't want one.

03:30.794 --> 03:35.047
Miss Biers, this tape of yours has put
fuel on a fire that was about to die.

03:36.091 --> 03:38.718
People are angry, they are
distrustful of the military.

03:38.802 --> 03:39.886
Yeah, with good reason, ma'am.

03:39.970 --> 03:41.971
In some cases,
with good reason.

03:42.306 --> 03:45.641
But I want to show the people what life
aboard the Galactica is really like.

03:45.726 --> 03:49.061
I want to put a human face
on the officers and the crew

03:49.146 --> 03:52.982
who protect us against Cylons
and guard our freedoms every day.

03:54.276 --> 03:56.235
You might not like that
face when you see it.

03:56.320 --> 03:57.570
What would
that be?

03:57.654 --> 03:59.071
ROSLIN: All we
really want

03:59.156 --> 04:01.073
is a balanced story.

04:01.366 --> 04:04.744
Show us what the men and women
of Galactica are really like.

04:06.705 --> 04:08.539
That's it?
That's it.

04:10.208 --> 04:13.669
And I need you to do it now
before we tear each other apart.

04:19.843 --> 04:22.053
The CAG had better start
cracking some heads.

Sorry, sir, they were left
over from a civilian run.

06:10.412 --> 06:11.871
I've been meaning to throw them out.

06:11.955 --> 06:13.289

You'll have that.

But you start shooting anything that
compromises the safety of the ship,

06:35.979 --> 06:37.813

is an oxygen recirc unit.

Capt. Lee Adama, Commander of the

09:02.375 --> 09:05.461
And I suggest you find yourselves
an exit as soon as possible,

09:05.545 --> 09:07.630

we need to see here.

idea was that?

09:23.730 --> 09:25.439
How did your
family respond?

09:25.523 --> 09:28.525
My Dad went crazy
when I enlisted.

09:28.610 --> 09:30.653
He thought the military was a joke.

09:31.571 --> 09:34.615
A refuge for emotional
cripples and patriotic fools.

09:34.741 --> 09:36.408
But you signed
up anyway.

I guess I just wanted
to believe in something.

You think it'll give it more memory?

09:44.793 --> 09:47.795
Yeah, it seems pretty simple.
Maybe just a basic adjustment.

She's supposed to be
interviewing me, isn't she?

10:00.684 --> 10:03.102
Well, of course she should. Your
title alone commands respect.

10:03.186 --> 10:06.814
Of course it does. It's a rare commodity
around here. I mean, I'm the Vice President.

You'll do whatever's
necessary to protect our child.

suit, but it serves us in the moment.

Hi. D'Anna Biers,

10:49.232 --> 10:50.649
Oh, you're the reporter.

10:50.734 --> 10:54.445
That's right. Cmdr. Adama said the
News Service might be joining us.

10:55.864 --> 10:57.364
I suppose you're,

10:58.116 --> 11:00.909
well, very busy doing a lot
of interviews, I would imagine.

11:00.994 --> 11:03.787
Well, I would love
to speak to you.

11:03.872 --> 11:05.956
If you've got a second,
we can do it now.

11:06.041 --> 11:09.626
No. I'm afraid not.
I am very busy.

11:09.919 --> 11:12.379
Really, really busy, at
the moment. Snowed under.

11:12.756 --> 11:17.217
But if you get in touch with one of my
aides, there might be a small window tomorrow.

11:17.302 --> 11:19.094
I'm not promising
anything, honestly.

11:19.179 --> 11:22.431
But, I might be able to
give you an interview then,

11:23.141 --> 11:25.184
if that's what you would like.

11:26.311 --> 11:27.436
Good.

11:27.520 --> 11:30.439
Good. Good. Well, you just carry on.

little man.

recognized you with your clothes on.

Look, I'm sure you
thought it was clever

11:49.793 --> 11:54.338
busting into the pilot's duty locker,
but the area's off-limits for a reason.

11:54.422 --> 11:58.175
It's the one place where my
people can unwind, be themselves.

11:58.259 --> 12:01.804
D'ANNA: You seem to think that your
pilots deserve special consideration.

12:03.723 --> 12:05.265
Actually, I do.

12:05.892 --> 12:07.309
Like everyone else,

12:07.936 --> 12:11.230
my pilots have lost their
families, their friends,

12:11.940 --> 12:13.941
everyone they
ever cared about.

12:14.317 --> 12:18.487
But on top of that, they are asked to put
their lives on the line every single day

12:18.571 --> 12:21.240
for a fleet that seems more
interested in what they do wrong,

12:21.324 --> 12:23.283
than in what they do right.

12:24.202 --> 12:27.996
They're not asking for your pity, but
they damn well deserve your respect.

Oh, that's fantastic. That's just great.

12:51.729 --> 12:54.106
I knew it. How did I miss that?

12:54.190 --> 12:56.775
Maybe if your knuckledraggers
spent more time on maintenance

12:56.860 --> 12:58.277
and less time
frakking around.

12:58.361 --> 13:00.863
This knuckledragger
just saved your ass, sir.

13:01.489 --> 13:03.615
Why don't you say that
a little louder, Chief?

13:03.700 --> 13:04.741
I don't think the
camera heard you.

13:04.826 --> 13:06.618
You know what? Frak the
camera. You've been riding my...

13:06.703 --> 13:07.744
Don't even
try defending...

13:07.829 --> 13:08.829
...for no frakking reason!

13:08.913 --> 13:10.497
Knock it off!

13:11.040 --> 13:13.333
Chief, fix
the ship.

13:13.751 --> 13:15.335
Yeah, fix the... Hey!

13:15.837 --> 13:17.838
What?
Hey, enough!

13:18.381 --> 13:21.842
Chief, fix your ship. You
get the hell out of here, now.

13:21.926 --> 13:23.385
Get the camera out of my face.

13:26.181 --> 13:27.764
(THUDDING)

13:31.728 --> 13:33.312
(STARBUCK SIGHING)

13:33.396 --> 13:34.980
She has been pissing me off all week.

13:35.064 --> 13:36.607
What the hell's going on?

13:37.275 --> 13:40.903
I'm taking her off rotation until
she gets her head rewired. I mean...

13:42.864 --> 13:44.865
Uh-uh. Can't do it.
We need the pilots.

13:44.949 --> 13:48.660
Besides, if I scratched everyone
who popped off at the Chief,

13:48.745 --> 13:50.204
the cooks would be flying the missions.

13:50.288 --> 13:51.705
Son of
a bitch.

13:55.001 --> 13:56.793
Did you get all that? You happy?

13:56.878 --> 13:57.878
Come on.

13:59.589 --> 14:01.340
Walk away.

14:07.972 --> 14:10.182
We were never trained for crowd control.

14:10.266 --> 14:13.644
First order of business when under
attack is defend yourself and your squad.

14:13.728 --> 14:15.187
But these
were civilians.

14:15.271 --> 14:17.940
I have 10 stitches that
say we were under attack.

14:18.566 --> 14:22.444
Truth is, it was a command frak-up the
moment Tigh put us on that supply ship.

14:22.529 --> 14:25.489
I'm not surprised someone's trying
to take out that drunk son of a bitch.

14:25.573 --> 14:26.698
All right. Private. Belay that.

14:26.783 --> 14:27.908
Col. Tigh's been
threatened?

14:27.992 --> 14:29.868
No. This interview's
over. Shut that off.

14:30.995 --> 14:32.204
Commander.

14:32.288 --> 14:33.413
Watch your
step, please.

14:34.165 --> 14:35.457
Okay, come on.

14:40.088 --> 14:41.505
Sitrep.

14:42.298 --> 14:45.676
Fleet's quiet, no enemy
contact for the last 10 days.

14:46.761 --> 14:48.845
No Cylon contact, anyway.

14:49.556 --> 14:52.307
Well, they have their
job to do. We have ours.

14:53.768 --> 14:55.602
Did you hear about the
meeting on Cloud Nine?

14:55.687 --> 14:58.230
Reps flying in from
every vessel in the fleet

14:58.314 --> 15:00.732
for a king-size bitch
session? Yeah, I've heard.

15:00.817 --> 15:03.569
Well, they sent us an
invitation to send a delegation.

15:03.653 --> 15:04.820
You're it.

15:06.739 --> 15:07.781
Do you mind?

15:07.865 --> 15:08.865
D'ANNA: No, no.
Go ahead.

15:12.120 --> 15:13.287
We're in.

15:13.371 --> 15:16.248
I'm not exactly the most popular
guy in the fleet right now.

15:16.332 --> 15:20.377
Well, it'll be good then, to let your
cutters know that you're not afraid of them.

15:20.587 --> 15:23.046
That what you think?
I've been hiding?

15:29.053 --> 15:31.179
What the hell is going on here, Bill?

15:31.264 --> 15:34.975
You've been doing this too long. We
were worried about ulterior motives.

15:35.059 --> 15:38.437
You're going because you're not
afraid and people should see that.

15:38.855 --> 15:41.231
Plus, it'll also give people
a chance to vent their feelings

15:41.316 --> 15:43.108
instead of seething in private.

15:43.192 --> 15:47.362
And finally, I think
you need a little R&R.

15:48.740 --> 15:51.283
ADAMA: So consider this
mandatory shore leave.

15:51.743 --> 15:54.578
Take a swim.
Get some sleep.

15:55.705 --> 15:56.747
Sir.

15:56.831 --> 15:57.873
And

15:58.541 --> 16:00.250
stay away
from the bar.

16:06.424 --> 16:09.468
Three. There's three. So, you got lots.

16:09.886 --> 16:12.512
STARBUCK: Good luck, Colonel.
Have fun on Cloud Nine.

16:13.723 --> 16:14.890
TIGH: You bet.

16:19.812 --> 16:21.104
(HISSING)

16:32.367 --> 16:33.950
PILOT: Initiating pre-flight.

16:36.579 --> 16:38.080
(BLASTS)

16:38.831 --> 16:40.207
What's
going on?

16:40.291 --> 16:41.625
Abort launch! Everybody out, now!

16:41.751 --> 16:43.001
(ALARM BLARING)

16:48.925 --> 16:52.052
Everybody back. Get back, now.

17:06.901 --> 17:08.235
What's going on?

17:08.319 --> 17:11.405
The main bus is totaled. Looks
like somebody took a hammer to it.

17:13.282 --> 17:16.493
If this had blown in transit, the
cabin would have vented to space.

17:28.881 --> 17:30.257
Someone's trying to kill you, Saul.

17:30.341 --> 17:31.717
Comes with
the stripes.

17:31.801 --> 17:34.094
It's because of that
damned Gideon incident.

17:34.178 --> 17:35.470
Ellen, we don't know that.

17:35.555 --> 17:36.805
Of course we do.

17:38.558 --> 17:40.726
D'Anna Biers left
two messages already.

17:40.810 --> 17:42.561
She's giving you the
chance to tell your side.

17:42.645 --> 17:45.772
I don't have to explain
myself, especially to her.

17:48.609 --> 17:51.236
Roslin wants to placate the fleet,

17:51.320 --> 17:54.322
put the great Bill Adama
back on his pedestal.

17:54.449 --> 17:57.576
The fastest way to do that
is by hanging you out to dry.

17:58.286 --> 18:00.579
Why do you think Adama wanted
to send you to Cloud Nine?

18:00.663 --> 18:02.372
The Gideon happened on my watch.

18:02.457 --> 18:03.540
Yes.

18:04.292 --> 18:08.003
But you didn't order those
jar-heads to open fire.

18:10.006 --> 18:11.006
(SIGHS)

18:11.090 --> 18:13.008
This is so
like you, Saul.

18:14.302 --> 18:18.722
Always the proud soldier, taking
the heat because it's honorable.

18:21.517 --> 18:26.313
When are you going to realize
we're all alone out here?

19:00.890 --> 19:02.057
(SIGHING)

19:03.226 --> 19:05.811
D'ANNA: Are you afraid
when you go into combat?

19:06.562 --> 19:09.689
First thing they tell you is
to assume you're already dead.

19:09.774 --> 19:11.399
D'ANNA: Well, that
sounds ghoulish.

19:11.484 --> 19:12.901
Yeah, maybe.

19:14.320 --> 19:16.988
But dead men don't get scared
or freeze up under fire.

19:18.866 --> 19:21.493
Me, I'm just worried that
hell's going to be a lonely place

19:21.577 --> 19:24.996
and I'm gonna fill it up with
every toaster son of a bitch I find.

19:25.623 --> 19:27.999
D'ANNA: What's been
the hardest for you?

19:28.084 --> 19:32.420
They try to turn off the human part of
you because that's what'll get you killed.

19:34.298 --> 19:37.259
But when you're out in the
field, it's not that easy.

19:39.136 --> 19:40.804
Nothing's that easy.

19:47.311 --> 19:48.979
GUARD: You got
five minutes.

19:50.940 --> 19:53.066
Sharon? It's me.

19:54.610 --> 19:55.610
Sharon!

19:57.530 --> 19:58.613
Give me
your light.

19:58.698 --> 19:59.739
GUARD: What the hell
are you talking about?

19:59.824 --> 20:02.117
Give me your light, now.
Something's wrong.

20:07.206 --> 20:09.457
Oh, gods.
Call Dr. Cottle.

20:09.834 --> 20:10.834
HELO: Now!

20:10.918 --> 20:12.002
(CRYING)

20:15.339 --> 20:17.799
D'ANNA: Does that help you
cope with the stress?

20:18.342 --> 20:19.509
Not really.

20:21.345 --> 20:24.973
Look, all that I ever wanted was
to be an officer on a Battlestar.

20:25.224 --> 20:28.894
Okay, I trained my whole life,
trained harder than anyone in my unit.

20:28.978 --> 20:33.648
Basically, I put my life on hold
until I was assigned to Galactica.

20:35.776 --> 20:40.155
Then the Cylons hit and I realized
that this is all that I know.

20:41.157 --> 20:43.575
Tech manuals,
commands, and tactics.

20:43.659 --> 20:46.286
You know, I'm not
saying that I'm unhappy.

20:46.829 --> 20:48.788
Just wondering if
there's something more.

20:49.040 --> 20:50.832
D'ANNA: And what
have you discovered?

20:54.503 --> 20:55.587
I hate cigarettes.

20:55.671 --> 20:56.671
(COUGHS)

20:57.673 --> 20:59.549
Ambrosia's good
with a chaser.

21:00.593 --> 21:03.511
And if you have
enough ambrosia,

21:08.351 --> 21:10.101
they don't
really hurt that much.

21:11.187 --> 21:13.939
There you go. We'll make
this as painless as possible.

21:16.025 --> 21:17.067
Drink?

21:17.151 --> 21:19.110
Is this an interview
or a cocktail party?

21:19.195 --> 21:21.780
Are you kidding? This is
how we keep it painless.

21:21.864 --> 21:23.990
Just like to keep it casual, that's all.

21:24.659 --> 21:25.909
Please.

21:26.911 --> 21:28.286
Cheers,
Colonel.

21:28.371 --> 21:29.371
Cheers.

21:32.041 --> 21:33.833
D'ANNA: Before
we begin,

21:35.419 --> 21:38.505
I had heard rumors that,
that you had death threats

21:38.589 --> 21:40.173
leveled against you.
Is that right?

21:40.257 --> 21:43.843
This is a military vessel. We
have rumors for every occasion.

21:45.179 --> 21:48.473
Was it hard for you to take over your
friend's command when he was shot?

21:48.557 --> 21:52.852
I didn't take anything. Command
fell to me and I did my duty.

21:52.937 --> 21:56.356
D'ANNA: But you were in full command
of Galactica for more than a week,

21:56.649 --> 22:00.402
and in that time there were a number
of controversial actions taken.

22:00.486 --> 22:02.821
You're talking
about the Gideon.

22:04.907 --> 22:06.408
I made a
military decision.

22:06.492 --> 22:09.452
Given the same circumstances,
I'd do it again.

22:09.954 --> 22:12.372
So you have no regrets, whatsoever?

22:21.424 --> 22:23.258
(GLASS BREAKS)

22:23.342 --> 22:24.592
You're trying
to set me up!

22:24.677 --> 22:27.178
Colonel, why do you think there
was no official investigation

22:27.263 --> 22:28.847
into the
Gideon Massacre?

22:29.765 --> 22:30.849
Please come.

22:30.933 --> 22:32.058
Get out of
my face!

22:36.605 --> 22:38.106
Did you
get that?

22:38.315 --> 22:39.357
Got it.

22:41.444 --> 22:43.445
Someone's
a mean drunk.

22:53.914 --> 22:56.708
Great. I could use
a sparring partner.

22:56.792 --> 22:59.419
Sorry. I didn't bring my gloves.

22:59.503 --> 23:00.628
Too bad.

23:00.796 --> 23:04.382
Capt. Adama said that I could
ask you about the new pilots.

23:04.508 --> 23:08.136
Yeah, well, Capt. Adama
likes to push my buttons.

23:09.805 --> 23:11.222
(PANTING)

23:13.934 --> 23:16.603
So, what do you look
for in a new recruit?

23:18.064 --> 23:19.064
(PANTING)

23:19.482 --> 23:20.774
Coordination.

23:25.321 --> 23:26.780
Good reflexes.

23:27.907 --> 23:29.365
Total commitment.

23:35.164 --> 23:36.164
(GRUNTS)

23:38.167 --> 23:43.129
Most of all, someone crazy
enough to follow me into combat.

23:49.678 --> 23:52.180
D'ANNA: Colonel, why do you think
there was no official investigation

23:52.264 --> 23:53.681
into the Gideon massacre?

23:53.766 --> 23:54.808
D'ANNA: Please come.

23:54.892 --> 23:55.934
TIGH: Get out of my face.

23:59.063 --> 24:02.941
I want to apologize for Col. Tigh's
behavior. It was uncalled for.

24:03.025 --> 24:04.359
Seems like a lot of people have been

24:04.443 --> 24:06.945
apologizing for him over
the years, Commander.

24:08.948 --> 24:10.657
So level
with me.

24:11.909 --> 24:15.537
Why is Col. Tigh not being
charged in the Gideon incident?

24:18.415 --> 24:21.668
We're at war
against an enemy

24:22.545 --> 24:24.546
with a vastly
superior force.

24:24.755 --> 24:28.967
I will not sacrifice the few people we
have left on the altar of public outrage.

24:29.051 --> 24:31.177
So four civilians
are dead

24:31.387 --> 24:33.680
and Tigh and the shooters take a walk.

24:33.764 --> 24:35.473
Nobody takes
a walk.

24:37.434 --> 24:39.185
We all gotta
live with it.

24:54.076 --> 24:58.079
KELLY: Viper five-niner-one Galactica,
you are cleared into the break.

24:58.455 --> 25:02.000
Portside landing bay hands-on approach.
Checkers are green. Call the ball.

25:02.418 --> 25:03.835
KAT: Roger ball.

25:04.837 --> 25:08.006
Wait a second,
guys. Damn it!

25:08.299 --> 25:09.799
Speed
two-zero-five.

25:09.884 --> 25:13.469
Keep your power up, Kat, you're
dropping below glideslope.

25:15.014 --> 25:16.890
(PANTING) Controls are messed up.

25:17.516 --> 25:18.933
Come on.

25:19.727 --> 25:20.727
(PANTING)

25:23.022 --> 25:25.857
Still too low. Wave off, Kat. Wave off!

25:29.945 --> 25:32.530
What the hell is going on?
That is her third wave-off.

25:32.615 --> 25:34.324
When we make a contact,

25:34.408 --> 25:36.743
the squadron's got seconds
to put it all together.

25:36.827 --> 25:38.786
Pre-flight, weapons check,
communications,

25:38.871 --> 25:40.872
one mistake,
we're a smear in the cockpit.

25:41.081 --> 25:42.540
I don't understand, is she trying to...

25:42.625 --> 25:45.501
Shut the
frak up. Kat.

25:46.003 --> 25:47.587
STARBUCK: We're gonna
do this, okay?

25:47.671 --> 25:51.341
Leave the throttle alone down the middle,
then chop it at the come-on in close

25:51.467 --> 25:53.384
and feel for the deck. KAT:
The controls are messed up.

25:53.469 --> 25:55.220
I can't feel it.

25:56.764 --> 25:57.722
I can't do it.

25:57.806 --> 26:01.059
Kat, we did this all through training, okay?
You're gonna stick this, just like before.

26:01.143 --> 26:02.143
KAT: No.

26:02.228 --> 26:07.065
Viper five-niner-one Galactica, you are
cleared into the break. Call the ball.

26:07.399 --> 26:09.984
Too low,
five-niner-one. Wave off!

26:10.694 --> 26:13.446
No, she's putting down!
Kat, full throttle now.

26:14.615 --> 26:16.241
I can't feel it.

26:16.492 --> 26:19.410
When you came back
after a successful run,

26:19.495 --> 26:23.331
let me tell you, it is
better than a great meal.

26:23.457 --> 26:27.502
Better than hitting a
jackpot. It's better than sex.

26:28.170 --> 26:30.380
KAT: I can't do it.

26:32.883 --> 26:34.259
(ALARM BLARING)

26:35.761 --> 26:36.928
She missed
the trap.

26:37.012 --> 26:40.431
Damage control, medics,
report to portside hangar bay.

26:47.189 --> 26:49.649
WOMAN ON P.A.: Medics to
portside hangar bay.

26:49.733 --> 26:52.277
What the hell happened?
Kat's made the trap 100 times.

26:52.361 --> 26:54.570
Yeah, I guess 101 was a real bitch, huh?

26:54.655 --> 26:57.282
KAT: Let go of me.
Let me go.

26:57.992 --> 26:58.992
STARBUCK: Hey.

27:00.327 --> 27:01.327
Kat!

27:01.495 --> 27:03.162
It's Starbuck. You're okay. You're home!

27:03.247 --> 27:06.666
Home? Home is dead. We gotta get
out of here, they're gonna kill us!

27:07.376 --> 27:09.127
STARBUCK: What are these,
stims?

27:09.211 --> 27:11.087
Please don't
do this.

27:11.380 --> 27:13.006
(KAT SCREAMING)

27:13.966 --> 27:14.966
KAT: Let go.

27:15.050 --> 27:16.050
(YELLING)

27:16.176 --> 27:17.885
No!
Let go!

27:20.431 --> 27:21.681
KAT: Let go
of me!

27:21.765 --> 27:22.974
We're
gonna die!

27:23.183 --> 27:24.559
(CRYING)

27:24.810 --> 27:27.312
STARBUCK: Get my pilot to sick bay now.

27:30.774 --> 27:34.235
Stims. By the look of it, she's
been taking them by the handful.

27:35.904 --> 27:36.904
Hey.

27:42.494 --> 27:43.578
SHARON: Don't you
dare touch me.

27:43.662 --> 27:44.662
COTTLE: Listen to me.

27:44.747 --> 27:46.039
What are
you doing?

27:46.123 --> 27:49.042
COTTLE: Listen to me. I'm
trying to save your baby.

27:49.668 --> 27:51.919
Hold her still! GUARD:
This is a restricted area.

27:53.088 --> 27:55.423
GIARD: Commander,
she's over here.

28:00.304 --> 28:05.016
Cmdr. Adama, that woman looks
just like the late Lt. Valerii.

28:05.100 --> 28:06.726
The tape, please.

28:08.354 --> 28:10.021
Why would Galactica
be harboring a Cylon?

28:10.105 --> 28:11.439
The tape.

28:15.277 --> 28:17.111
Did the
baby survive?

28:28.540 --> 28:31.626
You understand that even a hint
of this could be devastating

28:31.710 --> 28:33.044
to the morale
in the fleet.

28:33.128 --> 28:35.546
You are the master
of understatement.

28:36.924 --> 28:40.843
You know, after the Gideon, this could
turn the entire fleet against you.

28:45.391 --> 28:49.352
Then the real question is,
whether or not it matters to you.

28:51.313 --> 28:55.316
You know, I am sick to death of people
like you questioning my patriotism.

28:56.527 --> 28:58.945
We all want this
fleet to survive.

29:43.490 --> 29:47.201
I think you're doing very well.
Very well, under the circumstances.

29:47.327 --> 29:49.912
I understand this has been
a difficult job for you.

29:50.164 --> 29:52.290
I mean, I hear that your
reports haven't exactly

29:52.374 --> 29:55.209
ingratiated you with
the Commander, have they?

29:55.711 --> 29:57.879
(SCOFFS) Or the rest of
the crew, for that matter.

29:58.005 --> 30:01.215
Still, luckily, as a member
of the civilian government,

30:01.300 --> 30:04.760
I'm here to assure you that
I have no such reservations.

30:05.345 --> 30:08.014
I think most of the crew
understands I'm just doing my job.

30:08.098 --> 30:11.309
As are we all. All just
doing our jobs, aren't we?

30:11.393 --> 30:13.686
I'm just doing my job.
You're just doing your job.

30:13.770 --> 30:16.272
Okay. Cut to
the chase, Gaius.

30:17.691 --> 30:20.401
Tell her why you deserve
to lead this fleet.

30:21.737 --> 30:25.907
As I myself discovered,
when I was stranded,

30:26.325 --> 30:28.826
stranded on Kobol,

30:28.911 --> 30:32.413
I found that the stress
of survival revealed

30:32.498 --> 30:36.876
leadership qualities that previously
I didn't even know that I possessed.

30:36.960 --> 30:38.461
Really.
Yeah?

30:38.712 --> 30:41.589
I understand your party
took several casualties.

30:43.133 --> 30:45.426
Yes. That was
very unfortunate.

30:47.221 --> 30:49.764
They were heroes,
every one.

30:51.141 --> 30:55.228
You know what, I'm ready.
Shall we shoot this one?

30:56.772 --> 30:58.439
(ALARM BLARING)

30:59.274 --> 31:02.026
Oh, it's probably just a false
alarm. Ignore it. You're okay.

31:02.110 --> 31:05.154
Bill, you take the hangar deck.
I'm gonna take the CIC. Go.

31:06.114 --> 31:09.116
Please. You're as safe as
houses down here. Really.

31:09.326 --> 31:12.119
MAN ON P.A.: Incoming Cylon
Raiders. This is not a drill. Repeat.

31:12.579 --> 31:13.829
That's showbiz.

31:17.334 --> 31:18.334
What have
we got?

31:18.418 --> 31:20.211
Two Raiders,
closing fast.

31:21.838 --> 31:23.422
(ALARM BLARING)

31:30.097 --> 31:33.558
Sir, the Cylon Raiders
are on CBDR with Galactica.

31:33.642 --> 31:35.810
Speed
two-two-point-seven-niner.

31:35.894 --> 31:37.061
Dualla,
what's CBDR?

31:37.145 --> 31:39.689
Constant bearing, decreasing
range. A collision course.

31:39.773 --> 31:41.232
TIGH: Where the
hell's the CAP?

31:41.316 --> 31:42.441
DUALLA: Other side of the fleet, sir.

31:42.526 --> 31:46.445
Scramble the alert fighters. Set
Condition 1 throughout the entire fleet.

31:46.530 --> 31:49.407
Have them spool up
their FTLs, just in case.

31:51.535 --> 31:53.869
Let's go. Let's go.
Let's go. Move. Move.

31:54.204 --> 31:56.247
HOTDOG: Clear this deck.
Get this out of here.

31:56.331 --> 31:57.373
What's the
sitrep?

31:57.457 --> 31:58.457
Two bandits,
coming hard.

31:58.542 --> 32:00.418
Just keep your eyes open and follow us.

32:00.502 --> 32:03.170
All right, let's go. Let's get the birds
in the hole. Let's go move them out.

32:03.255 --> 32:04.255
Get this flyer
out of here.

32:04.339 --> 32:07.258
Let's go. Move them fools out of here.

32:09.177 --> 32:10.636
First team
in the tubes.

32:10.721 --> 32:12.513
Dee. Pilots on speaker.

32:12.764 --> 32:14.348
D'ANNA: Did you ever come
to terms with your dad?

32:15.017 --> 32:19.604
I wouldn't let him. The
last time we talked, it got

32:20.564 --> 32:21.564
heated.

32:22.149 --> 32:24.984
I told him I never
wanted to see him again.

32:27.279 --> 32:29.614
Three weeks later,
the Cylons attacked.

32:31.742 --> 32:34.952
Okay, so I'm new at
this. Should I be scared?

32:35.037 --> 32:36.287
I am.

32:42.044 --> 32:44.837
All right, people, that's it. Last
bird's away, let's clear the nest.

32:44.921 --> 32:46.714
Get this deck ready for recovery.

32:46.798 --> 32:48.966
Let's go! Let's go!
Let's go! Move. Move.

32:49.051 --> 32:50.843
Sir, Alert Vipers
are away.

32:50.927 --> 32:53.387
Gun Control reports
weapons manned and ready.

32:54.181 --> 32:56.182
APOLLO: Apollo,
wireless check.

32:56.266 --> 32:57.933
STARBUCK: Starbuck,
I'm hearing you.

32:58.018 --> 33:00.144
HOTDOG: Hotdog one-four-one,
loud and clear.

33:00.228 --> 33:01.979
GRAYSHIRT:
Grayshirt, loud and clear.

33:02.064 --> 33:03.564
KINGSTON:
Kingston, you're good.

33:05.233 --> 33:08.569
Apollo. Tally two Cylon
Raiders, close formation.

33:08.945 --> 33:11.989
This is Starbuck. Roger that.
Roger formation.

33:12.074 --> 33:14.283
APOLLO: Prepare engage.
Weapons hot.

33:14.368 --> 33:17.995
Targets in view. Repeat. Targets
in view. Locked six-four-two-one.

33:20.082 --> 33:21.082
Copy that.

33:23.960 --> 33:27.088
Engaging Cylon Raiders.
Engaging Cylon Raiders.

33:27.381 --> 33:29.674
STARBUCK: They're breaking
formation. Hotdog, stick with me.

33:29.758 --> 33:31.008
HOTDOG: Roger that.

33:31.093 --> 33:32.343
Come on, you...

33:34.096 --> 33:36.305
HOTDOG: I've got no joy,
I lost visual!

33:36.390 --> 33:38.182
They're throwing me
right on my stick.

33:38.266 --> 33:39.517
Come on, Starbuck.

33:39.601 --> 33:43.562
STARBUCK: Hotdog, Raider's on your
left eight. I'm on him. I got him.

33:43.647 --> 33:45.022
Yeah! Splash one!

33:45.107 --> 33:46.524
Targeting second Raider.

33:48.068 --> 33:51.320
KINGSTON: Kingston, Bandit's
taking off. Take evasive action.

33:51.405 --> 33:54.240
APOLLO: I've got him,
Kingston, come on. Come to papa.

33:55.283 --> 33:56.992
Damn it, take the shot.

33:59.788 --> 34:01.622
APOLLO: That's a kill.
Yes.

34:02.290 --> 34:03.290
Outstanding.

34:03.500 --> 34:05.751
Dradis shows clear,
Commander.

34:09.131 --> 34:10.589
This is the
Commander.

34:10.674 --> 34:14.885
TIGH: Cylon Raiders have been intercepted
and destroyed. Good work, people.

34:14.970 --> 34:18.472
STARBUCK: Roger that, Galactica.
Let's head back to the bird farm.

34:19.141 --> 34:22.685
Secure from Action
Stations. Set Condition 3.

34:22.811 --> 34:25.646
Mr. Gaeta,
you have the deck.

34:26.356 --> 34:27.606
Yes, sir.

34:35.574 --> 34:37.825
Set Condition 3
throughout the ship.

34:37.909 --> 34:39.702
Repeat. Set Condition 3.

34:40.287 --> 34:42.371
Does this ever
get any easier?

34:42.456 --> 34:43.539
No, ma'am.

34:43.623 --> 34:44.999
It gets harder.

34:51.339 --> 34:52.631
Thank you.

34:58.221 --> 34:59.847
Was 15 degrees?

34:59.931 --> 35:01.056
Sixteen.

35:01.183 --> 35:02.600
So, how'd it
go out there?

35:03.852 --> 35:07.313
Well, we didn't lose
anyone. That's a good day.

35:18.617 --> 35:19.867
Ellen?

35:29.586 --> 35:31.545
(LAUGHING)

35:31.838 --> 35:35.216
I'm not sure I've found
a story in all this yet.

35:40.388 --> 35:41.639
Go back a bit.

35:45.644 --> 35:47.061
Yeah. There.

35:52.067 --> 35:53.651
I know that book.

35:53.735 --> 35:55.194
That's by Kataris.

36:07.290 --> 36:09.834
What's wrong, Colonel?
Need a drink?

36:11.419 --> 36:12.878
(ELLEN GAGGING)

36:18.677 --> 36:19.677
(GAGS)

36:21.263 --> 36:22.429
You can
go to hell.

36:22.514 --> 36:26.016
I've been there.
It was called Gideon.

36:26.643 --> 36:29.103
I can't eat.
I can't sleep.

36:30.605 --> 36:32.147
I see their faces.

36:33.733 --> 36:36.902
Those weren't Cylons we
attacked, those were real people.

36:38.071 --> 36:40.030
They looked
like my dad.

36:40.740 --> 36:42.783
They looked like
my little brother.

36:42.868 --> 36:45.035
This isn't gonna change anything.

36:45.120 --> 36:48.706
At least the people on the
Gideon will have their justice.

36:49.666 --> 36:51.083
If that's what this
is about, then do it.

36:51.167 --> 36:52.543
I will. I'll do it.

36:52.627 --> 36:55.045
Somebody has to pay for
what happened on that ship.

36:55.130 --> 36:59.466
I was in command, I sent
you there, it's my fault.

37:05.765 --> 37:07.516
Come on, son.

37:09.311 --> 37:10.477
Do it.

37:21.489 --> 37:24.992
Gideon was an accident.
This is a choice.

37:25.911 --> 37:27.870
Colonel. TIGH: We're all right here.

37:35.879 --> 37:37.671
Let's go,
Lieutenant.

37:45.430 --> 37:46.722
(ELLEN CRYING)

37:48.058 --> 37:50.309
Would you get out of my face?

37:52.354 --> 37:54.104
(CRYING)

37:56.733 --> 37:58.400
What made you do it, Kat?

37:58.818 --> 38:00.152
I was tired.

38:01.154 --> 38:02.112
(SIGHS)

38:02.197 --> 38:03.739
Haven't gotten any sleep.

38:03.823 --> 38:06.575
I felt like I was losing my edge.
I don't know what else to do.

38:06.660 --> 38:08.118
Couldn't you talk to someone?

38:08.203 --> 38:10.913
Who am I gonna talk to?
We're all in the same hole.

38:11.039 --> 38:13.457
Okay, there are no
replacements coming up.

38:13.541 --> 38:15.292
There's no down time.
This is it.

38:16.920 --> 38:19.171
So I started taking stims.

38:19.506 --> 38:21.632
D'ANNA: You made a mistake.
It happens.

38:21.716 --> 38:26.220
KAT: Yeah, except now my flight's a pilot
short. Those guys, they're just as tired

38:26.304 --> 38:30.265
and they're just as messed up as I was,
but they're still laying it on the line.

38:31.267 --> 38:34.645
I've worked my ass off
defending this fleet.

38:34.896 --> 38:37.898
I've been frustrated.
I've been angry.

38:37.983 --> 38:41.151
I've been everything that
you can possibly think of.

38:41.569 --> 38:45.906
But this is the first time
that I've felt ashamed.

38:48.201 --> 38:49.451
(SIGHING)

38:49.536 --> 38:51.161
I've seen enough.

38:51.830 --> 38:52.830
Kill it.

38:53.665 --> 38:56.959
Look. I understand this might
be hard for you to watch...

38:57.043 --> 38:59.962
It's a hatchet job. The
fleet already thinks we're

39:00.046 --> 39:02.881
a bunch of trigger-happy
assassins, this just confirms it.

39:02.966 --> 39:06.427
You show us with our pants
down and our asses hanging out.

39:09.597 --> 39:11.557
Don't you have
anything to say?

39:13.351 --> 39:14.935
I think it's great.

39:15.979 --> 39:19.023
ADAMA: I think she did exactly
what we asked her to do.

39:19.107 --> 39:24.111
She put a human face on the
guardians of the fleet. Warts and all.

39:28.491 --> 39:30.117
I'm proud of it.

39:33.580 --> 39:35.622
You can show it to
the entire fleet.

39:35.707 --> 39:37.958
Doesn't get better than that.

39:38.251 --> 39:39.668
I'd like to
see the end.

39:39.753 --> 39:40.836
So would I.

39:43.381 --> 39:46.133
Go ahead. Yeah.

39:51.639 --> 39:54.391
D'ANNA: I came to Galactica
to tell a story.

39:55.060 --> 39:59.438
In all honesty, I thought I knew what that
story was, before I ever set foot there.

39:59.647 --> 40:03.984
How an arrogant military let their
egos get in the way of doing their jobs.

40:04.110 --> 40:07.321
Safeguarding the lives
of the civilian population.

40:08.156 --> 40:11.366
But I found out that the truth
was more complex than that.

40:11.743 --> 40:13.869
These people aren't Cylons.

40:13.953 --> 40:17.331
They're not robots blindly following
orders and polishing their boots.

40:17.415 --> 40:18.832
They're people.

40:19.250 --> 40:22.336
Deeply flawed, yes.
But deeply human, too.

40:22.420 --> 40:24.505
And maybe that's
saying the same thing.

40:28.093 --> 40:30.719
What struck me most is that,
despite it all,

40:30.804 --> 40:34.348
the hardships, the stress, the
ever-present danger of being killed.

40:34.432 --> 40:37.184
Despite all that,
they never give up.

40:37.310 --> 40:40.479
They never lie down on the road
and let the truck run them over.

40:40.563 --> 40:44.608
They wake up in the morning, put
on their uniforms and do their jobs.

40:44.692 --> 40:47.027
Every day. No pay. No rest.

40:47.112 --> 40:51.365
No hope of ever laying down the burden
and letting someone else do the job.

40:54.327 --> 40:56.495
There are no
relief troops coming.

40:56.871 --> 40:59.665
No Colonial fleet training
new recruits every day.

40:59.749 --> 41:02.417
The people on
Galactica are it.

41:02.794 --> 41:06.964
They are the thin line of blue
that separates us from the Cylons.

41:07.090 --> 41:10.342
Lt. Gaeta told me
a remarkable statistic.

41:10.468 --> 41:14.888
Not a single member of Galactica's
crew has asked to resign. Not one.

41:15.140 --> 41:16.557
Think about that.

41:17.350 --> 41:20.435
If you wore the uniform,
wouldn't you want to quit?

41:20.520 --> 41:24.022
To step aside and say, "Enough. Let
someone else protect the fleet. "

41:24.107 --> 41:25.399
I know I would.

41:26.067 --> 41:28.360
But then,
I don't wear a uniform.

41:28.987 --> 41:32.197
Most of us don't,
and most of us never will.

41:46.754 --> 41:51.049
The story of Galactica isn't that
people make bad decisions under pressure.

41:51.134 --> 41:53.886
It's that those
mistakes are the exception.

41:54.137 --> 41:58.015
Most of the time, the men and women
serving under Cmdr. Adama get it right.

41:58.099 --> 42:00.809
The proof is that
our fleet survives.

42:00.894 --> 42:04.438
And with Galactica at
our side, we will endure.

42:04.731 --> 42:07.608
This is D' Anna Biers.
Fleet News Service.

42:08.234 --> 42:10.027
That was shown across
their entire fleet.

42:11.529 --> 42:13.822
Their resilience is remarkable.

42:14.782 --> 42:16.992
Play the footage that was cut.

42:18.161 --> 42:19.828
SHARON: What are you doing? Stop it.

42:19.913 --> 42:22.623
COTTLE: I'm trying to
save your baby.

42:24.042 --> 42:25.959
GUARD:
This is a restricted area!

42:26.044 --> 42:27.794
SHARON: Get off of me.

42:28.338 --> 42:32.049
I'm still alive.
She's still alive!

42:32.133 --> 42:33.759
I told you.

42:34.469 --> 42:35.844
That's
incredible.

42:36.846 --> 42:38.472
And the baby?

42:38.556 --> 42:39.932
D'ANNA: It was saved.

42:40.642 --> 42:43.393
We lost two Raiders relaying
the images back to the fleet,

42:43.478 --> 42:45.729
but I think the sacrifice was worth it.

42:45.813 --> 42:47.648
We must proceed
with caution.

42:47.732 --> 42:50.776
The child's life must be
protected at all costs.

42:51.861 --> 42:53.570
Yeah.

42:55.823 --> 42:58.158
It truly is a miracle from God.

43:09.212 --> 43:10.712
