WEBVTT

00:01.620 --> 00:03.247
He met with Kate.

00:03.250 --> 00:04.330
I saw him with her.

00:04.340 --> 00:05.750
Maybe they're just
a step ahead of us.

00:05.760 --> 00:08.479
They're supposed to be
taking care of them.

00:11.370 --> 00:13.838
-It's not you that I want.

00:29.750 --> 00:32.753
-I understand there's some
sort of computer program?

00:32.760 --> 00:33.499
But That's.

00:33.500 --> 00:34.330
All I know.

00:34.340 --> 00:37.332
That and the fact that the KGB
wants to get their hands on it.

00:37.340 --> 00:40.229
-They want us to move
on something now.

00:40.230 --> 00:42.983
Paint samples they used
on the stealth aircraft.

00:42.990 --> 00:46.778
They make radar absorbent
paint and we need a sample.

00:46.790 --> 00:48.291
-We have_ shoes
wrth specral soles

00:48.300 --> 00:50.803
that would pick up
traces of what we need.

00:50.810 --> 00:52.437
-What the hell is going on here?

00:52.440 --> 00:55.170
-When you deliver the
Echo program to me,

00:55.180 --> 00:57.660
I will let Nina
Sergeevna go free.

00:57.670 --> 01:01.583
And you two love birds
can fly off together.

01:06.120 --> 01:07.405
There you go.

01:10.210 --> 01:13.099
Anywhere in the factory
floor in 45 seconds.

01:13.100 --> 01:14.260
The paint dust is microscopic.

01:14.270 --> 01:15.521
You won't see it,
but it's everywhere.

01:15.530 --> 01:16.371
-Got it.

01:16.380 --> 01:18.132
-And more isn't better.

01:18.140 --> 01:20.051
Just get what you
need and move on.

01:20.060 --> 01:23.063
-When you get back to your
car, put them in here.

01:23.070 --> 01:27.564
-There's a dumpster on
Rockland between 11th and 12th.

01:27.570 --> 01:30.892
Just throw them in there,
then call from a phone booth

01:30.900 --> 01:34.575
five blocks down on
Purchase and 11th.

01:34.580 --> 01:37.219
This is the number for
this phone booth here.

01:42.420 --> 01:43.114
You look ready.

01:43.120 --> 01:45.839
Are you ready?

01:45.840 --> 01:47.626
-I'm ready.

01:47.630 --> 01:48.881
Great.

01:48.890 --> 01:50.369
We'll wait for your call.

01:50.370 --> 01:53.851
-Good luck.

02:49.210 --> 02:50.074
-What's going on with you?

02:55.460 --> 02:58.179
-Are you kidding?

02:58.190 --> 02:58.884
-No.

02:58.890 --> 03:01.085
It's not just that.

03:01.090 --> 03:01.863
I know you.

03:04.880 --> 03:06.461
Something else is
going on with you.

03:13.960 --> 03:16.394
-Maybe you just don't know
me as well as you think.

03:40.460 --> 03:44.009
-What do you want
to do about Paige?

03:44.020 --> 03:46.864
-I don't know.

03:46.870 --> 03:48.178
I mean, she's 14.

03:48.180 --> 03:50.250
She's going to give
us a hard time.

03:53.000 --> 03:57.209
-I can't believe she's in
Pennsylvania by herself.

03:57.220 --> 04:02.248
-When I was 14, my
mother had diphtheria.

04:02.260 --> 04:05.787
I took care of
her for 10 months.

04:05.790 --> 04:07.109
No one helped me.

04:07.120 --> 04:07.814
I went to school.

04:07.820 --> 04:08.502
1--

04:16.560 --> 04:17.936
-That must have been hard.

04:25.670 --> 04:29.310
There were these gangs
in Tobolsk for years

04:29.320 --> 04:30.935
after the war.

04:30.940 --> 04:35.286
And I used to have to get milk
from halfway across the city.

04:35.290 --> 04:39.317
And sometimes I'd get
jumped on the way back.

04:39.320 --> 04:42.289
I was a couple years
younger than Henry is now.

04:42.290 --> 04:44.872
And one day I noticed
this kid following me,

04:44.880 --> 04:47.587
and I recognised him
from the week before,

04:47.590 --> 04:52.175
which meant the others
were waiting ahead.

04:52.180 --> 04:54.842
And I just decided that's it.

04:54.850 --> 04:57.546
No more.

04:57.550 --> 04:59.108
So I turned around.

04:59.120 --> 05:00.849
I doubled back.

05:00.860 --> 05:01.554
And--

05:01.560 --> 05:03.221
Attention all units.

05:03.230 --> 05:04.527
127 zone.

05:04.530 --> 05:08.546
Shots fired at 5327 Industry
Concourse Boulevard.

05:08.550 --> 05:10.791
This is 42 alpha dispatch.

05:10.800 --> 05:12.028
POLICE DISPATCHER
Suspect

05:12.030 --> 05:16.524
has exited building, possibly
wounded, location unknown.

05:16.530 --> 05:18.168
Suspect is described as
white, middle aged male--

05:18.170 --> 05:18.864
Go.

05:18.870 --> 05:20.861
balding, medium to heft build.

05:21.570 --> 05:22.923
Stop.

05:22.930 --> 05:23.168
Stop.

05:23.170 --> 05:23.886
Stop.

05:27.100 --> 05:27.794
-Hello?

05:27.800 --> 05:28.494
-I did it.

05:28.500 --> 05:29.273
I got it.

05:29.280 --> 05:32.499
I-- I'm-- I'm shot.

05:32.510 --> 05:34.114
-Are you at the phone
booth we talked about?

05:34.120 --> 05:34.814
-Yes.

05:34.820 --> 05:38.768
And I put what you
wanted where we said.

05:38.770 --> 05:39.794
-Where you followed?

05:39.800 --> 05:40.710
-No.

05:40.720 --> 05:41.414
No.

05:41.420 --> 05:44.708
I don't-- oh my god.

05:44.710 --> 05:46.678
I'm bleeding.

05:46.680 --> 05:48.272
The,
uh, guard stopped me.

05:48.280 --> 05:49.474
I didn't have a
pass for the floor.

05:49.480 --> 05:50.174
He grabbed me.

05:50.180 --> 05:51.579
I pushed him and I ran.

05:54.410 --> 05:56.219
There's a lot of blood.

05:56.220 --> 05:56.936
-Stay where you are.

05:56.940 --> 05:57.838
We'll be right there.

06:03.250 --> 06:04.069
He dropped the package.

06:04.080 --> 06:05.854
He's at the phone booth.

06:05.860 --> 06:07.418
North south side,

06:07.430 --> 06:08.601
location clear.

06:08.610 --> 06:11.590
Units converge on the
east 10 to east 15.

06:11.600 --> 06:13.192
Copy that on east 15.

06:13.200 --> 06:14.189
-Go.

07:18.360 --> 07:19.349
-You got it.

07:19.350 --> 07:20.612
phone booth

07:20.620 --> 07:21.837
at the corner of
Purchase and 11th.

07:21.840 --> 07:24.820
Copy that, 44 alpha.

07:48.680 --> 07:50.272
Suspect's in custody.

07:50.280 --> 07:51.429
He's bleeding bad.

07:51.440 --> 07:52.259
We need EMT.

07:52.260 --> 07:53.352
OK.

07:53.360 --> 07:56.363
Paramedics are
three minutes out.

07:56.370 --> 07:58.349
Uh, he's code grey.

07:58.350 --> 08:01.308
At the corner out
here, he's gone.

08:35.090 --> 08:36.773
I appreciate your
concern, Agent Beeman,

08:36.780 --> 08:38.338
but I can assure
you there's no way

08:38.350 --> 08:40.159
the Soviets can get near Echo.

08:40.170 --> 08:41.512
-It's not on the ARPANET?

08:41.520 --> 08:42.214
-No.

08:42.220 --> 08:44.051
There's only one
place where it runs.

08:44.060 --> 08:45.459
It's here.

08:45.460 --> 08:49.874
Single compartment and
vault, one mainframe.

08:49.880 --> 08:51.017
-Well, I want to
interview anyone

08:51.020 --> 08:53.659
who works for the program.

08:53.660 --> 08:55.548
Review their security files.

08:55.550 --> 08:57.939
-The DOD security
reviewed all our personnel

08:57.940 --> 08:59.453
less than a month ago.

08:59.460 --> 09:03.317
Can't you just, uh,
review those reports?

09:03.320 --> 09:04.218
All right.

09:04.220 --> 09:05.255
All right.

09:05.260 --> 09:06.989
Just trying to
save a little time.

09:07.000 --> 09:08.558
If you want to meet
them, I can set it up.

09:08.570 --> 09:10.242
-Thank you.

09:10.250 --> 09:12.559
What about copies
of the program?

09:12.570 --> 09:15.141
-There are three
discs in the world,

09:15.150 --> 09:21.692
each kept in an EMP grade
hardened safe like this one.

09:31.660 --> 09:33.218
-So this is it, huh?

09:33.220 --> 09:34.676
-That's it.

09:34.680 --> 09:36.284
There's a copy at
Cheyenne Mountain,

09:36.290 --> 09:37.769
and another in a
location I don't

09:37.780 --> 09:40.169
know about so I can't
tell you about It.

09:40.170 --> 09:41.967
But I don't think
the KGB can find it

09:41.970 --> 09:45.383
without kidnapping
the President.

09:45.390 --> 09:47.631
-And what exactly
is on this disc?

09:49.880 --> 09:50.574
-Code.

09:52.960 --> 09:53.654
Code?

10:03.610 --> 10:05.578
-Hard to believe the
future the free world rests

10:05.580 --> 10:07.241
on all those numbers
and symbols, huh?

10:14.080 --> 10:16.526
-Yeah.

10:16.530 --> 10:17.895
-It was amazing.

10:17.900 --> 10:19.208
Two other church
groups were there.

10:19.210 --> 10:21.929
Everyone was
marching and singing.

10:21.940 --> 10:23.817
And not just at the
base we were at.

10:23.820 --> 10:26.345
People were protesting at
bases all over the country.

10:26.350 --> 10:28.386
-And was it, uh, peaceful?

10:28.390 --> 10:30.369
No problems?

10:30.370 --> 10:32.190
-We were peaceful.

10:32.200 --> 10:34.839
I mean, we were there
to protest for peace.

10:34.840 --> 10:37.013
But the police, you
should've seen them.

10:37.020 --> 10:37.839
They didn't care.

10:37.850 --> 10:39.169
-There were police?

10:39.170 --> 10:40.512
Cool.

10:40.520 --> 10:41.919
-It wasn't cool, Henry.

10:41.920 --> 10:46.937
It was-- Pastor
Tim got arrested.

10:46.940 --> 10:47.634
-What?

10:47.640 --> 10:48.800
-How did he get arrested?

10:48.810 --> 10:51.119
-Well, he chained
himself to the gate

10:51.120 --> 10:52.690
to keep them from
moving their trucks

10:52.700 --> 10:55.032
and their weapons in and out.

10:55.040 --> 10:57.713
-We||, chaining yourself
to the gate of an army base

10:57.720 --> 11:00.120
is a pretty good way to
make sure you get arrested.

11:00.130 --> 11:02.075
-It's called civil
disobedience, Dad.

11:02.080 --> 11:04.287
-We know what civil
disobedience is.

11:04.290 --> 11:06.508
-I'm not talking
about the idea of it.

11:06.520 --> 11:10.581
I'm talking about doing
it, making a difference.

11:10.590 --> 11:12.239
I don't expect
you to understand.

11:12.240 --> 11:13.889
-Paige, we let you go.

11:13.890 --> 11:16.404
-This moved me, OK?

11:16.410 --> 11:18.549
I mean, this is the whole
point of the church.

11:18.560 --> 11:20.733
It's not all about just
Jesus and the Bible.

11:20.740 --> 11:23.026
It's about what he represents.

11:23.030 --> 11:24.725
That he was willing
to sacrifice himself.

11:27.700 --> 11:28.394
Look.

11:28.400 --> 11:29.082
I-- I'm sorry.

11:29.090 --> 11:30.250
I know you don't
want to hear this,

11:30.260 --> 11:35.414
but he was willing to sacrifice
himself for the greater good

11:35.420 --> 11:36.466
and that inspires me.

12:28.540 --> 12:30.417
They in bed?

12:30.420 --> 12:31.239
-Out like a light.

12:31.240 --> 12:34.880
I don't think she
slept the whole trip.

12:34.890 --> 12:36.915
If she said one more thing
about nonviolent resistance,

12:36.920 --> 12:38.217
I was going to punch
her in the face.

12:40.910 --> 12:44.164
-At least she's got
some passion in her.

12:44.170 --> 12:45.580
She wants to do something good.

12:45.590 --> 12:48.104
-She thinks a church pastor
being arrested for loitering

12:48.110 --> 12:49.179
is some kind of hero.

12:49.180 --> 12:51.421
I know.

12:51.430 --> 12:54.319
I wish I could tell her about
the real heroes, you know.

12:54.320 --> 12:57.209
People sacrificing themselves
for this world, not

12:57.220 --> 12:59.176
some stupid children's
story about heaven.

13:03.800 --> 13:05.438
-Someone sacrificed
himself today.

13:10.080 --> 13:13.049
I got to go to Martha's.

13:13.050 --> 13:15.518
Still nothing from
the centre on Jerry?

13:15.520 --> 13:17.329
-No.

13:17.330 --> 13:18.957
Once they get the
exfil set, I'll

13:18.960 --> 13:20.678
head up there and send him off.

13:20.680 --> 13:23.114
-Good.

13:23.120 --> 13:24.576
I'll see you.

13:28.730 --> 13:30.288
-It's important you can
share anything with me.

13:31.670 --> 13:33.023
-I know.

13:33.030 --> 13:34.440
It isn't always easy.

13:34.450 --> 13:37.123
-We||, marriage
isn't easy, I guess.

13:40.210 --> 13:44.818
-I just thought-- I've
always imagined a family.

13:51.210 --> 13:52.689
-I am who I am, Martha.

13:52.690 --> 13:55.272
And I've tried not to
hide myself from you.

13:55.280 --> 13:57.737
And I've done the best I can.

13:57.740 --> 13:59.071
-I'm not accusing
you of anything.

13:59.080 --> 14:00.422
-Well, I know.

14:00.430 --> 14:07.074
It's just you did say
you would love me as I am

14:07.080 --> 14:15.044
and accept me as I am and
I guess this is who I am.

14:15.050 --> 14:17.985
And I don't see myself
having children.

14:17.990 --> 14:19.753
And I don't see that changing.

14:23.840 --> 14:25.239
I am sorry.

14:31.010 --> 14:31.772
-Well, don't apologise.

14:33.890 --> 14:34.584
-OK.

14:38.880 --> 14:41.940
But I am worried about you.

14:41.950 --> 14:45.829
Will you be happy with
me without children?

14:45.830 --> 14:48.731
Will what we have to
be enough for you?

14:54.140 --> 14:54.925
-I don't know.

15:00.380 --> 15:01.290
I honestly don't.

15:07.200 --> 15:10.966
Let's have some wine, huh?

15:10.970 --> 15:11.823
-That's a good idea.

15:15.250 --> 15:17.309
Do you want a snack?

15:17.310 --> 15:18.004
-No.

15:18.010 --> 15:19.034
I just want a drink.

15:24.350 --> 15:26.261
-Where's your corkscrew?

15:26.270 --> 15:28.989
-Our corkscrew, Clark.

15:28.990 --> 15:29.684
-Yeah.

15:29.690 --> 15:30.372
Yeah.

15:30.380 --> 15:32.860
Um, ours.

15:32.870 --> 15:34.144
I know.

15:34.150 --> 15:35.549
-It's in the drawer by the wall.

15:43.820 --> 15:45.594
Oh, I forgot to tell you.

15:45.600 --> 15:49.058
I-- I finally did it.

15:49.060 --> 15:50.027
It's called a Ladysmith.

15:54.020 --> 15:56.534
-Martha, do you even
know how to use this?

15:56.540 --> 15:58.030
-The man at the
gun shop showed me.

15:58.040 --> 16:00.258
It's pretty easy.

16:00.270 --> 16:01.623
And the guys from
the office are going

16:01.630 --> 16:04.929
to take me to the firing range.

16:09.160 --> 16:10.878
Hello?

16:10.880 --> 16:12.131
Oh, hi.

16:12.140 --> 16:12.845
Yes.

16:12.850 --> 16:15.318
Yes, he is.

16:15.320 --> 16:16.799
Of course.

16:16.810 --> 16:17.981
Oh, of course.

16:17.990 --> 16:19.719
Oh, I'm so sorry.

16:19.720 --> 16:20.527
It's your sister.

16:23.260 --> 16:24.147
-Hello?

16:24.150 --> 16:26.095
-C|ark, I'm so sorry
to call so late.

16:26.100 --> 16:27.397
-What happened?

16:27.400 --> 16:28.958
It's Uncle Drew.

16:28.970 --> 16:31.757
He's wandered off and
no one can find him.

16:31.760 --> 16:33.785
Mother is beside herself.

16:33.790 --> 16:35.030
She just wants you to come home.

16:35.040 --> 16:35.734
Yeah.

16:35.740 --> 16:36.434
Yeah, of course.

16:36.440 --> 16:38.021
Um, I'll be there
as soon as I can.

16:38.030 --> 16:38.724
I'm on my way.

16:38.730 --> 16:39.583
I'm-- I'm so sorry.

16:39.590 --> 16:40.284
I have to go.

16:40.290 --> 16:40.984
It's my uncle.

16:40.990 --> 16:42.070
I have to go to Indiana.

16:51.980 --> 16:53.277
-I got a signal an hour ago.

16:53.280 --> 16:55.532
The centre cannot find Larrick.

16:55.540 --> 16:57.053
-They can't-- they
can't find him.

16:57.060 --> 16:57.298
Wait.
He's not In Nicaragua?

16:57.300 --> 16:58.460
-He stopped sending reports.

16:58.470 --> 17:00.290
The centre started
working their contacts.

17:00.300 --> 17:02.268
Apparently, he asked the
Navy for family leave,

17:02.270 --> 17:03.931
flew back to the States.

17:03.940 --> 17:06.204
Now he's AWOL.

17:06.210 --> 17:07.757
He got back just before
George was killed

17:07.760 --> 17:09.705
and Kate went missing.

17:09.710 --> 17:10.756
-We have to get out of here.

17:10.760 --> 17:11.738
-Yeah.

17:19.560 --> 17:20.254
-Hey, kids.

17:20.260 --> 17:20.988
Get up.

17:20.990 --> 17:22.617
Great news.

17:22.620 --> 17:23.359
-Get your bags out.

17:23.360 --> 17:24.099
We've got to pack.

17:24.100 --> 17:25.032
UP/ UP, UP-

17:25.040 --> 17:25.779
Let's get dressed.

17:25.790 --> 17:27.405
This is going to be fun.

17:27.410 --> 17:28.104
Come on.

17:28.110 --> 17:29.782
-We're going to go out of
town for a couple days.

17:29.790 --> 17:30.597
-Surprise vacation.

17:30.600 --> 17:31.464
Come on, Henry.

17:31.470 --> 17:32.164
Get up.

17:32.170 --> 17:33.125
-What's going on?

17:33.130 --> 17:34.381
-We're going on a trip.

17:34.390 --> 17:35.084
Come on, Paige.

17:35.090 --> 17:36.409
Can you help me?

17:36.410 --> 17:37.479
-What time is it?

17:37.480 --> 17:40.278
-One of our clients cancelled
a motel reservation upstate.

17:40.290 --> 17:42.383
And if we leave
now, you can sleep on the way.

17:42.390 --> 17:44.164
We'll have the whole
day there tomorrow.

17:44.170 --> 17:45.728
-There's something
wrong with you.

17:45.740 --> 17:48.117
-There's a lot wrong with us,
but now we have to pack and go.

17:48.120 --> 17:49.678
Paige,
grab your shoes, OK?

18:03.230 --> 18:04.356
-This will tell
you where to leave

18:04.360 --> 18:10.105
the Echo information,
by tomorrow 3 PM.

18:10.110 --> 18:18.085
-Am I supposed to just trust
you that you'll let Nina go?

18:18.090 --> 18:20.399
-Are we known to keep our word?

18:20.410 --> 18:21.946
I believe we are.

18:21.950 --> 18:23.099
It's for this very reason.

18:27.350 --> 18:28.442
You really love her, yes?

18:33.650 --> 18:36.892
When we have Echo, where
should we tell her to go?

18:44.210 --> 18:46.223
-Tell her to meet me
were we first met.

18:49.290 --> 18:51.178
-She will be there at 8 PM.

18:57.600 --> 19:01.206
And don't tell her,
"I love you so much."

19:01.210 --> 19:03.098
A Russian woman
doesn't like that.

19:03.100 --> 19:07.013
She won't respect you.

20:15.110 --> 20:17.374
-Agent Beeman, Agent
Gaad is looking for you.

20:30.260 --> 20:30.954
-Martha.

20:38.960 --> 20:40.905
-Nothing beats
American fast food.

20:40.910 --> 20:44.038
Do you want something to drink?

21:30.820 --> 21:32.356
-This is what I
really look like.

21:41.840 --> 21:43.819
You doing OK?

21:43.820 --> 21:47.506
-Have you heard
anything from Kate yet?

21:47.510 --> 21:49.011
-As soon as know
something for sure,

21:49.020 --> 21:50.499
I promise I'll let you know.

21:53.140 --> 21:54.869
We're almost there.

21:54.880 --> 21:56.359
-Thank you.

22:11.200 --> 22:12.053
-Morning, Agent Beeman.

22:12.750 --> 22:13.785
-Morning.

22:13.790 --> 22:14.484
-Hey.

22:14.490 --> 22:15.184
Morning, Stan.

22:34.200 --> 22:34.894
-Hey, Beeman.

22:34.900 --> 22:35.582
Come here.

22:40.830 --> 22:42.786
-Yeah.

22:42.790 --> 22:46.214
-Take a look at this.

22:46.220 --> 22:48.939
Is it even?

22:48.940 --> 22:49.634
-Yeah.

22:49.640 --> 22:50.334
Looks good.

22:53.800 --> 22:55.722
-You all right?

22:55.730 --> 22:56.537
-Yeah.

22:56.540 --> 23:00.249
-I mean, I know things
haven't been good at home.

23:00.250 --> 23:00.944
-Yeah.

23:00.950 --> 23:02.895
Sandra moved out.

23:02.900 --> 23:06.347
-Oh, shit, Stan.

23:06.350 --> 23:07.055
-20 years.

23:10.210 --> 23:11.757
I don't know what happens now.

23:14.960 --> 23:17.394
-I just got a call
from Virginia Beach PD.

23:17.400 --> 23:18.139
Jerry Connors.

23:18.140 --> 23:20.051
His foster mother
called in yesterday.

23:20.060 --> 23:20.754
He's missing.

23:28.360 --> 23:30.590
-I'm going to go into town
to get some groceries.

23:30.600 --> 23:33.569
-When's mom coming
back from her hike?

23:33.580 --> 23:35.423
-When she gets tired
of the mountain air.

23:35.430 --> 23:36.124
Shouldn't be long.

23:36.130 --> 23:37.427
You guys want something special?

23:37.430 --> 23:38.124
Pop-Ta rts?

23:38.130 --> 23:39.290
Fruit Loops?

23:39.300 --> 23:40.028
-Strawberry frosted.

23:40.030 --> 23:41.019
-Coming up.

23:41.020 --> 23:42.009
-Thank you.

24:13.330 --> 24:14.809
-Here.

24:14.820 --> 24:18.790
Uh, let's get that other one.

24:18.800 --> 24:21.268
Now, we're-- I thought--
I thought we were up here.

24:21.280 --> 24:22.269
Weren't we up here?

24:25.260 --> 24:27.876
-Need help ﬁguring it out?

24:27.880 --> 24:30.997
-These backwoods roads
can be pretty confusing.

24:31.000 --> 24:32.126
-Everything's ready.

24:32.130 --> 24:33.870
-We'll be set up a
quarter mile due north

24:33.880 --> 24:35.859
of town, ready to
go in four hours.

24:35.860 --> 24:38.226
You bring him to us.

24:38.230 --> 24:39.800
-He'll be with a woman.

24:39.810 --> 24:40.640
Good luck with your trip.

24:58.330 --> 24:59.456
-Keep your hands out.

25:22.750 --> 25:25.366
-Where's mom and Dad?

25:25.370 --> 25:28.419
-mom's on a hike and Dad
went to the grocery store.

25:28.420 --> 25:29.785
You want to play "Monopoly?"

25:29.790 --> 25:31.405
-No.

25:31.410 --> 25:33.628
-"Chutes and
Ladders?" "Parcheesi?"

25:33.630 --> 25:34.324
-No.

25:34.330 --> 25:36.059
No.

25:36.060 --> 25:37.573
-Well, then what
do you want to do?

25:37.580 --> 25:40.014
-I want to go back to sleep.

25:40.020 --> 25:42.602
Why don't you go on a hike?

25:42.610 --> 25:43.872
-By myself?

25:43.880 --> 25:44.574
-Yeah.

25:44.580 --> 25:47.822
Or just sit here and wait
for mom and Dad to come back.

25:47.830 --> 25:49.468
If they're coming back.

25:49.470 --> 25:51.768
-Of course they're coming back.

25:51.770 --> 25:53.647
What's your problem, Paige?

25:53.650 --> 25:57.313
-I think-- never mind.

25:57.320 --> 25:58.014
-What?

26:04.110 --> 26:07.113
-You don't think
it's totally weird?

26:07.120 --> 26:08.849
They wake us up in the
middle of the night,

26:08.860 --> 26:14.218
drag us to a motel in the
middle of nowhere, and leave?

26:14.220 --> 26:16.222
-mom's on a hike and
Dad went to the store.

26:16.230 --> 26:17.879
What's the big deal?

26:17.890 --> 26:20.233
-How long have they been gone?

26:20.240 --> 26:22.879
-Where do you think they went?

26:22.890 --> 26:24.573
-I don't know and I don't care.

26:24.580 --> 26:25.274
I don't.

26:25.280 --> 26:26.019
I'm done.

26:26.030 --> 26:27.190
I'm counting the
days til I can get

26:27.200 --> 26:29.725
_the hell out of
this lunatic asylum.

26:29.730 --> 26:31.846
Go to college, be
with normal people.

26:34.660 --> 26:38.596
I guess 16 years.

26:38.600 --> 26:41.376
I mean, I didn't see
them all the time.

26:41.380 --> 26:45.362
But when we did, people like us
don't have a lot of people talk

26:45.370 --> 26:47.042
t0.

26:47.050 --> 26:49.473
-I guess.

26:49.480 --> 26:51.869
-I never met anyone
who loved their kids

26:51.880 --> 26:53.165
as much as your parents did.

26:57.450 --> 27:02.661
And the risks that they took,
it was because they believed

27:02.670 --> 27:05.002
in something greater
than themselves.

27:05.010 --> 27:07.478
You have to understand that.

27:07.490 --> 27:10.880
They wanted the world to
be better for everyone.

27:10.890 --> 27:11.584
For you.

27:11.590 --> 27:13.546
-Yeah, Kate already
told me all that.

27:13.550 --> 27:14.824
-But Kate didn't know them.

27:17.650 --> 27:22.098
It was just-- they
were amazing people.

27:22.110 --> 27:25.079
And they never-- they
never thought anything

27:25.080 --> 27:26.092
like this would happen, Jared.

27:29.480 --> 27:35.487
-And what you do, does
that happen often?

27:35.490 --> 27:38.516
-Well, I guess
it's always a risk.

27:41.060 --> 27:42.971
-And nobody's heard
anything from Kate?

27:45.650 --> 27:48.619
-How many times did
you meet with Kate?

27:48.630 --> 27:49.380
-A bunch.

27:54.550 --> 27:55.517
-Be quiet.

27:58.370 --> 27:59.610
-Don't.

27:59.620 --> 28:00.314
Hands.

28:07.050 --> 28:07.744
Drop the wood.

28:19.670 --> 28:22.218
Walk.

28:22.220 --> 28:24.780
Walk.

29:36.130 --> 29:37.119
-It's OK.

29:37.130 --> 29:38.119
It's OK.

29:42.250 --> 29:44.218
-Don't look at me like that.

29:44.220 --> 29:46.029
I didn't start it.

29:46.030 --> 29:49.340
You forced me to do
all these things.

29:49.350 --> 29:52.808
And then when it's finally
over, you take the last thing

29:52.810 --> 29:55.472
that I give you and you
use it to kill my brothers.

29:56.880 --> 29:58.040
-That wasn't supposed to happen.

29:59.210 --> 29:59.892
-Over here.

30:03.890 --> 30:04.606
Put these on.

30:08.040 --> 30:09.018
Come on.

30:29.620 --> 30:31.281
I'm turning you and
your partner in.

30:31.290 --> 30:33.622
I don't care what
happens to me anymore.

30:37.110 --> 30:38.407
-Yeah.

30:38.410 --> 30:39.229
You're such a decent man.

30:39.240 --> 30:41.708
You kill his parents,
his little sister.

30:41.710 --> 30:42.825
-I already told you.

30:42.830 --> 30:45.549
I didn't do that.

30:45.550 --> 30:46.414
Oh, believe what you want.

30:46.420 --> 30:47.114
I don't care.

30:47.120 --> 30:48.985
Get in the trunk.

30:48.990 --> 30:49.763
Now.

30:49.770 --> 30:50.464
-No.

31:17.940 --> 31:19.237
-Hang on a second.

31:19.240 --> 31:19.934
Hang on.

31:23.440 --> 31:24.429
Got 'em.

31:39.440 --> 31:43.365
-You-- you have to
tell-- you-- you

31:43.370 --> 31:45.395
have to tell Kate
that I'm sorry.

31:45.400 --> 31:46.970
You ahve-- you have to
tell Kate I'm sorry.

31:46.980 --> 31:47.674
-Jared, you're hurt.

31:47.680 --> 31:49.011
Just be quiet, OK?

31:49.020 --> 31:49.918
-You have to tell them.

31:49.930 --> 31:50.624
You have--

31:50.630 --> 31:51.039
-Who?

31:51.040 --> 31:51.734
Tell who?

31:51.740 --> 31:52.195
-The centre.

31:52.200 --> 31:54.213
You have to tell-- you have
to tell them that I saved you.

31:54.220 --> 31:55.756
They have to--
they have to know.

31:55.760 --> 31:57.022
-I will.

31:57.030 --> 31:59.373
I will.

31:59.380 --> 32:03.146
-I promised we were
going to be together.

32:03.150 --> 32:04.048
I love her.

32:04.050 --> 32:04.948
I love her.

32:04.950 --> 32:05.894
And she loves me.

32:09.970 --> 32:14.009
We were-- we were going-- we
were going to work together.

32:14.020 --> 32:17.808
We were-- we were going
to do great things.

32:17.820 --> 32:20.232
My parents, they
didn't-- I tried

32:20.240 --> 32:21.878
to tell them they
didn't understand.

32:21.880 --> 32:23.700
They were-- they
just wouldn't listen.

32:23.710 --> 32:28.318
You have-- you have to tell
Moscow that I saved you.

32:28.320 --> 32:31.517
-You did save us.

32:31.520 --> 32:33.886
-You-- you said my
parents loved me?

32:33.890 --> 32:36.256
They didn't love me.

32:36.260 --> 32:40.310
My-- my-- my family was a lie.

32:40.320 --> 32:43.187
My whole life was a lie.

32:43.190 --> 32:49.322
When they found out, my
father-- my-- my-- my father,

32:49.330 --> 32:52.788
he-- he didn't understand.

32:52.790 --> 32:54.838
The truth.

32:54.840 --> 32:57.775
It's the-- the only truth.

32:57.780 --> 33:01.750
Kate-- Kate told
me who-- who I am.

33:01.760 --> 33:04.035
Who I really am.

33:04.040 --> 33:06.463
-Jared, where did
you get that gun?

33:06.470 --> 33:08.199
-That day in the hotel.

33:08.200 --> 33:12.853
I-- he-- he threw me
up against the wall.

33:12.860 --> 33:14.339
He said he'd never
let it happen.

33:14.350 --> 33:17.854
He was screaming
like a crazy person.

33:17.860 --> 33:20.840
He didn't think I knew
where his gun was.

33:25.080 --> 33:29.801
My mother, she tried-- she
tried-- she tried to grab me.

33:29.810 --> 33:31.141
-And what about Amelia?

33:31.150 --> 33:33.311
-She was-- she was-- she
was hysterical and-- and she

33:33.320 --> 33:35.015
would've-- she would'v_e
gone straight to the police

33:35.020 --> 33:42.267
and-- she-- she didn't deserve--
she didn't deserve that.

33:42.270 --> 33:44.545
-And you just cleaned
up and went to the pool.

33:44.550 --> 33:46.723
-I had-- I had to.

33:46.730 --> 33:50.507
I had-- I had to
protect my cover.

33:50.510 --> 33:55.049
What we do, it's for something
greater than ourselves.

33:57.980 --> 34:02.428
Kate-- Kate always-- Kate
always-- Kate always--

34:02.430 --> 34:05.979
Kate always says it's
the work, the cause.

34:05.980 --> 34:09.893
That's what-- that's
what-- that's what matters.

34:09.900 --> 34:12.186
You have to-- you have
to-- you have to tell them.

34:12.190 --> 34:13.748
You have to tell,
when you see her.

37:28.180 --> 37:29.533
-Great trip.

37:29.540 --> 37:31.462
Can't wait to do that again.

37:31.470 --> 37:32.676
-Well, I had a good time.

37:32.680 --> 37:33.374
-Yeah.

37:33.380 --> 37:34.847
Me too.

37:34.850 --> 37:36.249
-Henry, why don't
you go upstairs

37:36.260 --> 37:38.421
and we'll be up to tuck
you in in a few minutes.

39:59.710 --> 40:01.234
VVhat
the hell is going on?

40:05.330 --> 40:06.957
-What happened with
Jared was a tragedy.

40:10.820 --> 40:13.618
Last year, the centre started
a program to develop officers

40:13.630 --> 40:17.384
they're calling "second
generation illegals."

40:17.390 --> 40:21.497
You do tremendous work, but
your cover would never hold up

40:21.500 --> 40:23.877
to the type of
background investigation

40:23.880 --> 40:26.007
required to join
the CIA or the FBI.

40:26.010 --> 40:30.322
However, one of your children
born to an American citizen

40:30.330 --> 40:31.809
would pass one of
these investigations.

40:34.430 --> 40:35.988
The centre asked
Emmett and Leanne

40:35.990 --> 40:39.289
to bring Jared into the fold.

40:39.300 --> 40:41.723
-And they said no.

40:41.730 --> 40:44.107
-The centre didn't
take no for an answer.

40:44.110 --> 40:45.691
-So they send Kate to Jared.

40:50.990 --> 40:54.198
-I want you know I had
nothing to do with this.

40:54.200 --> 40:55.918
I did not know about it.

40:55.920 --> 40:57.751
I would have fought it.

40:57.760 --> 41:00.320
-I believe you.

41:00.320 --> 41:02.379
-The centre, they
want Paige to be next.

41:05.810 --> 41:07.869
-That is not an option.

41:07.870 --> 41:10.418
-Those are your orders.

41:10.420 --> 41:11.978
First, soon, you
need to tell her

41:11.990 --> 41:15.141
who you really are,
who she really is.

41:15.150 --> 41:17.186
Get her ready.

41:17.190 --> 41:19.579
Then develop her until the time
is right for you to tell her

41:19.580 --> 41:22.572
that she will join our ranks.

41:22.580 --> 41:25.469
It was unforgivable for them to
go behind Emmett and Leanne's

41:25.470 --> 41:29.418
backs, but don't forget
what's at stake in this war.

41:29.420 --> 41:31.854
A second generation illegal
could change everything.

41:31.860 --> 41:34.579
And for the right child, if
could give their life a meaning

41:34.590 --> 41:37.923
and a purpose that they could
never get in this country.

41:37.930 --> 41:40.524
-That's for us to decide.

41:40.530 --> 41:45.775
-Paige is your daughter,
but she's not just yours.

41:45.780 --> 41:49.557
She belongs to the
cause and to the world.

41:49.560 --> 41:52.063
We all do.

41:52.070 --> 41:53.799
You haven't forgotten
that, have you?

43:19.180 --> 43:20.147
-I'm Philip Jennings.

43:25.070 --> 43:26.742
-I'm often under surveillance.

43:26.750 --> 43:27.546
I know.

43:27.550 --> 43:28.960
So you'll appreciate
the importance

43:28.970 --> 43:30.983
of what I have to say.

43:30.990 --> 43:34.448
If our organisation ever gets
anywhere near our daughter

43:34.460 --> 43:38.419
without our permission, my
wife and I are finished.

44:28.530 --> 44:30.009
-How did it go?

44:32.430 --> 44:33.590
-I don't think
they'll go near her.

44:37.440 --> 44:40.034
-She's our daughter.

44:40.040 --> 44:40.734
-I got that across.

44:46.510 --> 44:49.399
-Philip.

44:49.400 --> 44:52.767
She does need something.

44:52.770 --> 44:54.806
She's looking for
something in her life.

44:58.990 --> 45:04.678
What if-- what if this is it?

45:07.930 --> 45:08.624
-What?

45:13.060 --> 45:19.101
How can you even-- we swore.

45:22.370 --> 45:30.994
We _swore we would never--
it would destroy her.

45:34.910 --> 45:35.808
-To be like us?

45:47.520 --> 45:48.748
Paige.

45:48.750 --> 45:49.842
Henry.

45:49.850 --> 45:50.544
Dinner time.

45:55.000 --> 45:57.810
Paige, can you
grab the potatoes?
