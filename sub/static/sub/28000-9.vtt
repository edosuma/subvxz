[croaks]

00:14.639 --> 00:15.890
[panting]

00:17.642 --> 00:19.978
[Ezran]  Previously on  The Dragon Prince...

00:20.770 --> 00:25.942
I can't move, I can't walk,
and it's not going to get better.

00:26.025 --> 00:29.696
Oh... I can't leave you like this.
There has to be something.

00:29.779 --> 00:31.573
You need to calm down.

00:31.656 --> 00:34.117
- [doctor]  This is a hospital.
-[yelps]

00:35.201 --> 00:37.203
I am here to serve the king.

00:39.456 --> 00:41.541
King Ezran.

00:42.208 --> 00:46.212
But I'm not the king.
I'm just a prince. My dad is...

00:47.881 --> 00:50.341
No! No, no, no!

00:51.426 --> 00:52.552
[Zym whimpers]

00:53.636 --> 00:54.721
[snarling]

00:58.057 --> 00:59.017
Ezran?

00:59.934 --> 01:02.479
[chanting]

01:05.899 --> 01:07.734
You messed with something
you shouldn't have messed with,

01:07.817 --> 01:09.652
and now you're paying the price.

01:10.820 --> 01:12.072

01:16.284 --> 01:17.285

-Callum? Are you okay?

[theme music playing]

[roaring]

01:57.450 --> 01:59.244
[growling]

02:03.540 --> 02:07.377
Ezran, I hope you know
I never meant to hurt you or Callum.

02:08.086 --> 02:11.256
It was scary, Claudia. How you acted.

02:11.339 --> 02:14.801
I know. And I am so sorry.

02:18.805 --> 02:22.392
Thank you.
Don't worry about me, I'll be safe.

02:26.729 --> 02:28.273
-[banther growls]
-[man yelps]

02:33.361 --> 02:34.946
[Claudia] I'm surprised to see you here.

02:35.029 --> 02:37.866
And even more surprised
you weren't that banther's dinner.

02:37.949 --> 02:39.868
I kind of have a way with animals.

02:39.951 --> 02:41.703
And banthers are actually pretty friendly.

02:41.786 --> 02:44.080
They like praise, compliments,

02:44.164 --> 02:46.666
and a friendly scratch under the chin
every now and then.

02:46.749 --> 02:48.334
Hey, that's like me!

02:56.551 --> 02:57.677
Whoa!

02:59.345 --> 03:00.763
[Claudia] Wanna go up there?

03:04.684 --> 03:06.352
[Viren] I should end this right now!

03:06.436 --> 03:09.647
Throw the mirror into a river
and cut you off forever.

03:10.231 --> 03:11.357
You won't.

03:12.066 --> 03:13.860
You are too curious.

03:14.444 --> 03:16.696
Hungry for knowledge and power.

03:16.779 --> 03:20.283
Both things I can provide.

03:20.366 --> 03:23.786
Allow me... to earn your trust.

03:27.040 --> 03:29.250
And how would that work, exactly?

03:29.334 --> 03:30.585
Search your heart.

03:31.628 --> 03:33.796
There's something that you want
very badly.

03:33.880 --> 03:34.839
But...

03:35.590 --> 03:38.009
something or someone...

03:38.593 --> 03:39.928
stands in your way.

03:40.511 --> 03:41.471
I...

03:41.554 --> 03:44.682
I am having a problem getting
some people to listen to me,

03:45.475 --> 03:47.769
to hear the importance of what I'm saying.

03:48.436 --> 03:50.063
Who are these people?

03:50.730 --> 03:52.315
They are kings and queens.

03:52.398 --> 03:54.734
The leaders of the other
four human kingdoms.

03:55.401 --> 03:59.113
Then we will have to get their attention.

04:02.200 --> 04:05.912
[Claudia] So... Ezran, why are you here?

04:06.496 --> 04:09.249
-And by yourself?
-[Ezran] I found out something.

04:12.001 --> 04:13.294
My dad...

04:14.879 --> 04:16.089
That's okay.

04:16.172 --> 04:18.549
You don't have to talk about it
if you don't want to.

04:22.762 --> 04:24.847
I know it's not the same, but...

04:24.931 --> 04:28.268
when I was a kid, my mom and dad split up.

04:29.102 --> 04:31.938
I remember hearing them
fight a lot at night

04:32.021 --> 04:33.481
after we went to bed.

04:34.065 --> 04:35.108
And then one day,

04:35.692 --> 04:39.612
they told us Mom was moving back
to Del Bar, where her family was from.

04:40.530 --> 04:41.572
And then they said...

04:42.323 --> 04:43.491
we had to choose.

04:45.326 --> 04:47.620
And Soren chose Dad.

04:48.746 --> 04:52.000
How could I choose? How could I do that?

04:52.917 --> 04:56.004
Then my mom looked at my dad,
and she told me to stay.

04:57.130 --> 05:01.342
She said I had to stay with Soren,
that this was my home,

05:01.426 --> 05:03.469
and my brother and I needed each other.

05:04.387 --> 05:05.805
And then she left.

05:06.973 --> 05:08.308
But how could she do that?

05:08.891 --> 05:10.351
Why would she leave you?

05:11.686 --> 05:13.896
I think she needed to leave for herself.

05:14.522 --> 05:17.233
To be happy... somehow.

05:17.317 --> 05:19.986
You might have noticed
my dad is pretty intense.

05:21.821 --> 05:22.864
You must miss her.

05:23.489 --> 05:26.909
Losing her has been the hardest thing
that's ever happened to me.

05:27.493 --> 05:28.745
[Ezran] When you grow up,

05:28.828 --> 05:30.997
sometimes there are changes
you don't expect,

05:31.622 --> 05:33.875
and you have to face things
you're not ready for.

05:35.877 --> 05:37.211
Callum told me that.

05:37.879 --> 05:40.465
You are so lucky
to have a brother like Callum.

05:41.340 --> 05:42.258
I know.

05:43.718 --> 05:45.011
[Ezran sobs]

05:47.013 --> 05:50.683
[Claudia] And...
I'm lucky to have my brother.

05:50.767 --> 05:53.728
Soren is a doof, but he's my doof!

05:53.811 --> 05:55.855
[sneezes]

05:58.441 --> 06:00.860
[Claudia] I know he would do anything
to protect me,

06:00.943 --> 06:02.862
and I would do anything for him.

06:05.073 --> 06:06.949
[bird chirping]

06:11.662 --> 06:15.083
Ezran, you don't just have a way
with animals...

06:15.833 --> 06:17.794
you can talk to them, can't you?

06:19.003 --> 06:21.422
Yes. I can talk to them.

06:23.257 --> 06:26.427
I need you to help me
find something in the forest.

06:26.511 --> 06:31.015
If I can find milk-fruit,
maybe I can help Soren.

06:33.226 --> 06:34.977
[Rayla] Callum! Wake up!

06:35.061 --> 06:36.229
[breathing raggedly]

06:36.312 --> 06:38.189
You've got to stay with me!

06:38.272 --> 06:40.399
[voice echoing]  Stay with me!
Stay with me!

06:40.483 --> 06:42.276
[Sarai]  Breathe. Breathe.

06:42.902 --> 06:43.945
Breathe.

06:45.863 --> 06:48.241
-[gasping]
-[Sarai] Callum, you need to breathe.

06:50.034 --> 06:50.868
[gasping]

06:50.952 --> 06:52.745
You just need to breathe, sweetie.

06:54.872 --> 06:55.873
[exhales]

06:55.957 --> 06:57.375
I feel so overwhelmed with everything.

06:57.458 --> 07:01.045
I... I have so many thoughts,
things racing through my head.

07:01.129 --> 07:04.048
Sometimes you just need to focus
on the present,

07:04.132 --> 07:07.051
take a deep breath and just be.

07:07.135 --> 07:08.052
[gasping]

07:08.136 --> 07:10.555
[Rayla] Oh, Callum! Please, come back.

07:10.638 --> 07:12.682
It doesn't matter what you did before.

07:12.765 --> 07:15.226
I just want you to be okay again.

07:16.144 --> 07:17.311
Callum!

07:19.147 --> 07:21.899
[Sarai] Sometimes things
can get so complicated

07:21.983 --> 07:24.527
that our minds
can't quite sort them out alone.

07:24.610 --> 07:28.531
But when you slow down
and let yourself breathe,

07:28.614 --> 07:32.577
your spirit and your body
can catch up with your mind, and help out.

07:32.660 --> 07:34.704
I just have to... breathe?

07:35.872 --> 07:38.499
[inhales and exhales]

07:39.750 --> 07:42.462
To know something truly and deeply,

07:42.545 --> 07:46.215
you must know it with your head,
hand, and heart.

07:46.841 --> 07:49.469
Mind, body, and spirit.

07:50.303 --> 07:54.765
I love you with all of myself,
and I always will.

07:55.683 --> 07:58.936
I can't lose you like this,
you mean too much to me!

08:00.771 --> 08:02.940
Callum, I...

08:03.649 --> 08:04.567
I...

08:04.650 --> 08:06.486
[gasping]

08:07.320 --> 08:10.114
[laughs nervously] Oh!
Look, you're awake now.

08:10.198 --> 08:11.616
You're even looking cheery.

08:12.158 --> 08:14.785
And is that a twinkle in your eye?

08:15.912 --> 08:19.499
Oh, no. That's not a twinkle,
it's one of those sleep crusties.

08:19.582 --> 08:21.459
-Here, let me...
-[Callum] I have it.

08:22.835 --> 08:24.504
I understand the sky arcanum.

08:30.426 --> 08:32.303
This is where the squirrel said
we should go.

08:33.721 --> 08:35.264
There, I see it.

08:35.348 --> 08:36.807
A milk-fruit bush.

08:41.812 --> 08:44.315
Look, Claudia!
There's a family of deer here.

08:45.525 --> 08:47.652
I almost forgot how deer love milk-fruit!

08:47.735 --> 08:50.238
Yes. Yes, they do.

08:51.822 --> 08:54.575
Callum needs you.
Do you know the way back?

08:54.659 --> 08:56.994
I've got plenty of friends to help me
if I get lost.

08:57.745 --> 08:59.080
I'm so sorry.

08:59.664 --> 09:03.501
I'm sorry if the things I did before
were frightening or confusing.

09:03.584 --> 09:05.878
I care about you and Callum a lot.

09:06.963 --> 09:08.005
I know.

09:16.514 --> 09:18.057
[exhales]

09:19.350 --> 09:21.435
[Rayla] You understand
the sky arcanum now?

09:21.519 --> 09:24.981
It's not one simple thing.
It's all the things.

09:25.064 --> 09:27.650
They just had to... come together,
you know?

09:27.733 --> 09:31.654
It's like, I used to hold
the power of the sky in my hand, right?

09:31.737 --> 09:32.905
But now that's gone.

09:32.989 --> 09:37.326
But, Rayla, the whole world
is like a giant primal stone,

09:37.410 --> 09:39.078
and we're inside it!

09:39.662 --> 09:42.290
I'm inside sky magic,

09:42.373 --> 09:45.876
but it's also in me,
with every breath I take.

09:45.960 --> 09:48.045
[breathing deeply]

09:49.088 --> 09:50.715
That kind of makes sense!

09:50.798 --> 09:54.385
Yes! And I kept thinking about birds,
and sails,

09:54.468 --> 09:55.886
and how they connect to the wind.

09:55.970 --> 09:58.764
And I thought I had to find my wings...

09:58.848 --> 10:00.182
but that's just it,

10:00.808 --> 10:02.768
I am the wing!

10:04.395 --> 10:06.814
That makes less sense... but okay!

10:10.359 --> 10:11.402
Moment of truth.

10:13.279 --> 10:14.989
Let's see if I can really do this.

10:18.784 --> 10:20.453
[exhales]

10:27.918 --> 10:31.464
[inhales and exhales]

10:44.393 --> 10:45.895
[inhales]

10:49.106 --> 10:50.232
Aspiro.

10:57.865 --> 10:59.158
Ezran, you're back!

11:04.080 --> 11:05.414
He was gone?

11:06.707 --> 11:07.750
-[Zym chirps]
-[Ezran grunts]

11:07.833 --> 11:09.585
[laughing]

11:09.669 --> 11:11.796
I love your zappy kisses.

11:11.879 --> 11:14.924
Callum, you figured it out?
You can do magic again!

11:15.007 --> 11:17.009
-That's incredible, Prince Callum.
-Thanks.

11:17.551 --> 11:19.720
Uh... who are you?

11:19.804 --> 11:21.514
You missed a few things
while you were out.

11:21.597 --> 11:24.392
This is Corvus. He's on our side now.

11:24.475 --> 11:26.268
I've always been on the same side.

11:27.061 --> 11:29.605
-I serve the young king.
-What?

11:30.648 --> 11:32.024
I know about Dad.

11:37.655 --> 11:40.449
I... I don't know what to say.

11:41.117 --> 11:42.660
I'm so sorry that I didn't tell you.

11:42.743 --> 11:45.955
I tried to, but I just... couldn't.

12:03.389 --> 12:08.018
I'm sorry, little one,
but you are agile, young, and alive...

12:08.894 --> 12:09.979
and I need you.

12:15.401 --> 12:18.028
-[objects clattering]
-[man] Hey! What are you doing?

12:18.112 --> 12:20.865
[woman] You can't be in here!
The patient needs rest.

12:23.576 --> 12:26.620
Claudia? What... what are you doing?

12:28.789 --> 12:30.040
[screaming]

12:32.793 --> 12:34.795
[screaming continues]

12:39.884 --> 12:43.929
[grunts] Hey, what's... what's this?

12:44.013 --> 12:45.931
I can... I can move my toes.

12:46.724 --> 12:48.350
I can move my toes!

12:48.934 --> 12:51.479
I forgot how much
I love wiggling them. [laughing]

12:53.189 --> 12:55.065
I can... I can feel again!

12:55.149 --> 13:00.237
I can feel my knees,
and my strong, powerful thighs. [laughs]

13:00.905 --> 13:03.491
And my ribs! Ahh! Ugh!

13:04.283 --> 13:06.202
[groaning] I broke ribs, didn't I?

13:06.744 --> 13:09.038
[groaning] It's horrible!

13:09.121 --> 13:11.540
I can feel again! Ahh!

13:12.833 --> 13:13.751
[sighs]

13:14.335 --> 13:15.169
Claudia.

13:15.669 --> 13:18.589
Clauds, are you okay?

13:19.298 --> 13:22.801
[breathing heavily] You're gonna
be better now.

13:23.511 --> 13:25.012
That's all that matters.

13:32.019 --> 13:34.021
[inhales and exhales]

13:38.234 --> 13:40.361
Everything's packed
and everyone's healthy.

13:40.444 --> 13:43.280
And we're just a few hours
from the border of Xadia.

13:43.364 --> 13:44.573
Packed and ready!

13:45.824 --> 13:47.660
-[Zym yips]
-[Bait grunts]

13:49.411 --> 13:50.871
[whimpers]

13:50.955 --> 13:53.165
-Let's do this.
-[Ezran] Callum.

13:55.209 --> 13:57.586
When you told me
assassins were coming for Dad,

13:58.212 --> 14:00.047
I ran away and hid in the walls.

14:00.130 --> 14:02.508
With a healthy stash of jelly tarts,
as I recall.

14:03.092 --> 14:04.093
Yeah.

14:04.176 --> 14:08.222
And when I found out Dad was gone forever,
I ran away again.

14:09.056 --> 14:11.183
I've been running away from things
my whole life.

14:11.976 --> 14:14.061
But I can't run away from growing up.

14:14.144 --> 14:15.229
Now that you're King Ezran,

14:15.312 --> 14:18.482
are you gonna start saying
wise things like that all the time?

14:24.947 --> 14:28.409
When you grow up, you have to face things
you're not ready for.

14:29.618 --> 14:30.744
Wait, what?

14:31.662 --> 14:33.414
I'm not going with you to Xadia.

14:34.623 --> 14:36.792
I have to face my responsibility.

14:36.876 --> 14:39.378
Now that I'm King, I have to go home.

14:39.461 --> 14:41.839
Maybe I can help the world
better from the throne.

14:42.548 --> 14:45.050
I can do whatever I can to stop the war.

14:45.134 --> 14:48.971
Ezran, returning Zym to his mother
is the world's best hope.

14:49.054 --> 14:51.765
I know! And you guys will do that.

14:51.849 --> 14:55.895
You'll find his mom,
and Zym will take his place in Xadia,

14:55.978 --> 14:57.938
just like I have to take mine.

14:58.814 --> 14:59.648
Ezran...

15:00.274 --> 15:03.402
I wish I could go with you, but I can't.

15:04.486 --> 15:06.363
You and Rayla have to do this without me.

15:07.239 --> 15:09.742
I'll travel with the king,
and keep him safe.

15:09.825 --> 15:12.286
Ezran, are you sure?

15:13.037 --> 15:16.081
I'll miss you, Rayla,
but I'll see you again.

15:16.832 --> 15:17.750
I promise.

15:18.375 --> 15:20.794
You'd better. I know where you live.

15:21.712 --> 15:25.090
As soon as Zym is home,
I'll come back to help you.

15:26.175 --> 15:28.385
-I love you.
-I love you, too.

15:29.094 --> 15:31.305
[whimpering]

15:32.264 --> 15:34.308
I'm so proud of you, little guy.

15:34.391 --> 15:36.769
You're going to grow up
so strong and good.

15:36.852 --> 15:39.104
I'm sorry I couldn't help you
learn to fly,

15:39.188 --> 15:41.065
but I know you'll get it soon!

15:41.148 --> 15:42.149
[whimpers]

15:53.619 --> 15:57.957
I wish you could come with me, too,
but you need to go be with your mom.

15:58.707 --> 15:59.833
That's your home.

16:00.793 --> 16:02.044
Both of us need to go home.

16:03.921 --> 16:05.172
[whimpers]

16:09.885 --> 16:11.595
[yips]

16:11.679 --> 16:13.055
[whines]

16:19.311 --> 16:20.688
[Bait groans]

16:28.904 --> 16:31.657
[Aaravos]  You tried
to win over the other humans

16:31.740 --> 16:35.786
with loyalty and friendship,
but they ignored you.

16:35.869 --> 16:39.373
Those who fail tests of love
are simple animals.

16:39.456 --> 16:43.377
They deserve to be motivated by fear.

16:53.762 --> 16:55.764
[chanting]

17:25.169 --> 17:27.921
Bring terror to Del Bar...

17:28.005 --> 17:29.965
to Neolandia...

17:30.049 --> 17:31.592
to Evenere...

17:31.675 --> 17:34.011
and to Duren!

17:43.187 --> 17:46.065
[Rayla] This canyon leads
to the Moonstone Path.

17:46.148 --> 17:48.108
I can't believe we're almost to Xadia.

17:48.942 --> 17:52.237
We came this far and... Ez isn't with us.

17:52.780 --> 17:55.657
I know, but we can't think about that now.

17:56.283 --> 17:58.619
He's doing the right thing, and so are we.

18:00.996 --> 18:02.039
[yips]

18:09.129 --> 18:11.298
[Callum] One simply walks into Xadia, huh?

18:12.091 --> 18:13.217
[Rayla] Hold on!

18:14.927 --> 18:17.304
There's sort of a trick to it.

18:22.476 --> 18:25.020
Not all the rocks sink that quickly.

18:25.104 --> 18:28.107
A few will let us stand on them
long enough to walk across.

18:28.190 --> 18:31.527
Those special stones
are called the Moonstone Path.

18:32.694 --> 18:34.029
[Callum] Okay, great.

18:34.113 --> 18:36.740
-So how do we know--
-Patience, friend.

18:55.425 --> 18:58.387
The Moonstone Path! Oh, I get it.

19:31.753 --> 19:34.590
[Aaravos] You're in danger.
They've come for you.

19:34.673 --> 19:38.385
Do as I tell you. Prepare for battle.

19:39.261 --> 19:41.054
[guard banging on door] Lord Viren!

19:41.138 --> 19:43.473
Open up, by order of the High Council!

19:43.849 --> 19:47.978
[laughing] Well? Open it for them!

20:05.787 --> 20:07.039
[guards grunting]

20:21.220 --> 20:22.262
[grunting]

20:23.222 --> 20:25.349
[Pip screeching]

20:31.063 --> 20:32.481
Surrender, Viren!

20:33.106 --> 20:35.609
[Aaravos] Stop. It's over.

20:35.692 --> 20:38.862
But I can destroy them all!
I have all the power I need!

20:39.655 --> 20:40.614
[Aaravos] Stop!

20:40.697 --> 20:44.826
[Opeli] You're completely
surrounded, Viren! Give yourself up.

20:45.619 --> 20:47.079
Don't make me give the order.

20:59.258 --> 21:01.843
You... have betrayed me.

21:01.927 --> 21:03.095
[Aaravos]  No.

21:04.554 --> 21:06.098
I will stay with you.

21:27.869 --> 21:30.580
The sky's getting lighter.
We need to hurry!

21:30.664 --> 21:34.126
If the sun rises,
we won't be able to see the moon runes.

21:36.920 --> 21:37.879
Run!

21:51.351 --> 21:53.020
[whimpers]

21:54.438 --> 21:55.564
[Zym whimpers faintly]

21:55.647 --> 21:56.732
What's wrong?

21:57.858 --> 21:58.942
Why are you stopping?

22:01.945 --> 22:03.113
I can see something.

22:08.702 --> 22:09.995
They're in trouble!

22:11.246 --> 22:13.790
-[yips]
-[Ezran]  Okay, Zym, you can do this.

22:13.874 --> 22:15.417
You need to block the light.

22:27.888 --> 22:29.514
[Ezran]  You can do this, Zym!

22:31.099 --> 22:31.975
Whoo!

22:36.104 --> 22:37.939
-[Callum] He's flying!
-[Rayla] Whoo!

22:41.860 --> 22:42.694
[yips]

22:43.195 --> 22:46.364
You're doing it, you're flying!
I knew you could do it!

22:47.240 --> 22:49.117
He's trying to block the sun!

22:51.536 --> 22:53.205
-[Zym yelps]
-[both gasp]

22:53.288 --> 22:54.706
[whimpering]

22:58.376 --> 23:00.003
He isn't going to make it!

23:02.589 --> 23:03.757
Aspiro!

23:11.890 --> 23:13.975
[both] Yeah! Whoo!

23:21.775 --> 23:24.694
We can see the path again! Run!

23:29.866 --> 23:32.911
-We did it! We made it across!
-[Rayla] Whoo! Yeah!

23:35.831 --> 23:36.790
[yips]

23:39.084 --> 23:41.711
-[Ezran] Whoo!
-[Corvus] If I may be so bold...

23:42.337 --> 23:44.297
you're a weird king, King Ezran.

23:44.381 --> 23:45.841
[Ezran laughing] I know.

23:53.974 --> 23:56.893
[Soren] We both failed
our secret missions, Claudia.

23:57.811 --> 23:59.146
What's Dad gonna say?

24:00.438 --> 24:03.483
We're both alive,
that's the important thing.

24:03.567 --> 24:06.069
And we're not coming back empty-handed.

24:07.362 --> 24:09.489
It's the horn you cut off the dragon.

24:10.740 --> 24:13.243
Failed missions, mad Dad.

24:13.827 --> 24:16.496
But dragon horn means magic.

24:16.580 --> 24:18.748
Maybe Dad not mad!

24:20.292 --> 24:22.669
-Yes! That was amazing!
-[Soren] Ahh!

24:28.550 --> 24:30.051
[Rayla] This is it, Callum.

24:32.179 --> 24:33.138
Xadia.

24:34.389 --> 24:36.641
-[gasps]
-Oh, no.

24:37.934 --> 24:39.060
It's him.

24:39.853 --> 24:41.229
Sol Regem.

24:42.105 --> 24:43.940
[growls menacingly]
