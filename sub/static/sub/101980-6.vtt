WEBVTT

01:02.479 --> 01:05.065
Babe? It's here! It came!

01:06.692 --> 01:07.693
Dorothy?

01:07.776 --> 01:09.027
Shut up.

01:10.070 --> 01:12.197
Sorry, but come and see it.

01:17.077 --> 01:20.289
I read that colic isn't necessarily caused
by indigestion.

01:20.372 --> 01:22.875
It can be the result of psychic pain.

01:22.958 --> 01:25.627
He doesn't have psychic pain, honey.
He's a baby.

01:25.711 --> 01:26.712
Well...

01:26.795 --> 01:29.423
Well, leaving the womb
can be very traumatic.

01:29.506 --> 01:31.175
Well, this will solve everything.

01:31.800 --> 01:34.428
Because if we drink enough of it,
who needs sleep?

01:36.805 --> 01:38.849
Does it make magic caffeine?

01:39.474 --> 01:41.018
Kind of.

01:41.101 --> 01:42.936
Wait till you taste the crema.

01:43.478 --> 01:48.525
Portafilter. Fifty-eight millimeter,
chrome-plated brass.

01:55.866 --> 01:57.242
No.

02:02.206 --> 02:05.125
-I'll go.
-I'll make you a macchiato.

02:23.310 --> 02:24.853
Where is she?

02:25.729 --> 02:27.314
Where is she?

02:27.397 --> 02:29.066
Julian, stop him.

02:29.149 --> 02:31.193
-That's far enough.
-You listen.

02:31.276 --> 02:33.320
Now, I explained this to you in the car.

02:33.403 --> 02:36.198
If you wanna see Leanne,
you will bring us Jericho.

02:36.281 --> 02:41.078
"Thou shalt not do violence unto
a hired servant that is poor and needy."

02:41.161 --> 02:42.162
Deuteronomy.

02:42.788 --> 02:45.207
"Welcome to the jungle,
it gets worse here every day."

02:45.290 --> 02:46.375
Guns N' Roses.

02:47.292 --> 02:50.712
-Leanne!
-Don't you dare yell in my house.

02:50.796 --> 02:54.591
How could she have returned here?
She assured us she understood.

02:54.675 --> 02:59.137
All right. All right. Let's take a breath
and talk about this like civilized humans.

02:59.221 --> 03:00.514
George.

03:00.597 --> 03:02.724
Indulge me, okay?

03:03.392 --> 03:04.726
Let's try to work this out.

03:09.314 --> 03:11.441
Can we make a deal?

03:13.026 --> 03:14.987
Let's talk about this.

03:16.238 --> 03:21.618
Everything I delegate turns to shit.
Sean, just be firm and watch the money.

03:28.542 --> 03:31.837
We had a deal that the baby stays with us.

03:31.920 --> 03:33.589
Your deal was not with me.

03:33.672 --> 03:36.466
-Where the fuck did you find him?
-He was at the mall.

03:36.550 --> 03:38.677
Leanne sent the ransom.
She was fucking with you.

03:52.608 --> 03:54.818
Looks like someone
had quite a midnight snack.

03:58.322 --> 04:00.490
How was your evening, Mrs. Turner?

04:00.949 --> 04:05.162
A success. We found your uncle.
He's downstairs as we speak.

04:06.205 --> 04:07.789
You're not a very good liar.

04:08.749 --> 04:10.876
Surprising with all the practice you get.

04:11.710 --> 04:15.297
You can try and bait me, Leanne,
but it won't work.

04:15.923 --> 04:18.091
Jericho is coming home, and when he does,

04:18.175 --> 04:21.261
you'll be on your way with your uncle
back to where you belong.

04:21.345 --> 04:23.263
And until then,
you'll stay locked in here.

04:36.443 --> 04:37.861
Festering.

04:40.155 --> 04:41.990
Something rotten.

04:42.574 --> 04:44.785
The pipes.
We're getting the pipework done.

04:48.539 --> 04:51.959
The house. Of course.

04:56.129 --> 04:57.464
George.

05:04.596 --> 05:07.766
-She caused this.
-It's a plumbing issue.

05:07.850 --> 05:10.269
It's an old water pipe.
Should've been replaced decades ago.

05:10.352 --> 05:11.812
Foundation crumbling.

05:12.521 --> 05:17.734
Is this his despair
at her lack of submission?

05:17.818 --> 05:19.444
In my opinion, no.

05:22.155 --> 05:24.575
-There you are.
-How long?

05:24.658 --> 05:26.994
-What?
-How long has she been here?

05:27.077 --> 05:30.122
-How long--
-A week! She's been here a week.

05:30.205 --> 05:32.666
And you kept her all this time?

05:34.126 --> 05:35.127
Oh, no.

05:35.210 --> 05:37.880
No, no, no.

05:37.963 --> 05:39.631
-No, no, no!
-Jesus!

05:39.715 --> 05:41.717
This cannot happen.

05:42.593 --> 05:45.137
-What is he talking about?
-He's out of his fucking mind.

05:45.220 --> 05:47.890
-"For they know not what they have done...
-Is he praying for us?

05:47.973 --> 05:49.933
-No, he's doing that--
-Hey! Don't you pray for me!

05:50.017 --> 05:52.352
...for you are good and forgiving
and abounding in steadfast love

05:52.436 --> 05:56.064
-for all who call upon you."
-I have nothing to be forgiven for.

05:58.192 --> 06:02.196
It may not be too late to fix it.

06:03.363 --> 06:04.364
Stop him.

06:05.365 --> 06:06.366
Sean!

06:17.669 --> 06:19.171
I don't know what you want me to do.

06:19.254 --> 06:21.006
-Go up there.
-Where is she?

06:23.050 --> 06:24.176
Where is she?

06:29.973 --> 06:32.809
I'll cut him into pieces
until he tells me where Jericho is.

06:32.893 --> 06:34.311
What good will that do?

06:34.811 --> 06:37.814
-What do you suggest?
-We need to learn to talk his language.

06:37.898 --> 06:39.316
He's batshit.

06:39.900 --> 06:41.944
So let me talk to him, one-on-one.

06:43.153 --> 06:44.154
You?

06:45.113 --> 06:47.032
You tried in the car. It antagonized him.

06:48.200 --> 06:49.910
So I'll play along.

06:50.536 --> 06:52.788
Make him think I believe
in his crazy rantings.

06:52.871 --> 06:54.498
That way, maybe he'll trust me.

06:56.333 --> 07:00.003
Okay.
I've been in three fistfights in my life,

07:00.087 --> 07:02.798
and every single one of them
was because of Dorothy.

07:03.465 --> 07:07.594
-Bring on number four.
-I cannot fight you, Julian.

07:07.678 --> 07:09.555
But you can be punched.

07:09.638 --> 07:11.473
Why are you not frightened?

07:11.557 --> 07:13.183
-Of you?
-Of her.

07:13.267 --> 07:15.185
Of what she has done.

07:15.269 --> 07:18.230
The baby. He should never have been here.

07:18.313 --> 07:20.732
It was a mistake!

07:20.816 --> 07:22.359
Julian, I've got this.

07:22.442 --> 07:24.152
Sean, I don't think you do.

07:25.863 --> 07:27.281
Dorothy needs you.

07:35.539 --> 07:38.000
And? Did he drop any hints
about where Jericho is?

07:38.083 --> 07:41.837
Guy's a fucking loon.
Wouldn't shut up about returning Leanne.

07:42.462 --> 07:45.257
What is so important about this house
where we found her?

07:45.799 --> 07:47.801
I tried to punch him,
but he wouldn't let me.

07:50.179 --> 07:53.348
Where is Leanne?

07:53.432 --> 07:54.766
She's safe.

08:01.523 --> 08:05.319
What have you done, Sean?

08:07.446 --> 08:11.116
We needed help,
and she was the only one we could turn to.

08:11.200 --> 08:14.244
-So you took her?
-We didn't know what else to do.

08:16.330 --> 08:19.499
This is all her fault.

08:21.460 --> 08:26.381
She made you hope
for something that is not possible.

08:27.341 --> 08:29.968
It was cruel. Irresponsible.

08:32.221 --> 08:33.889
We must return her.

08:35.432 --> 08:36.850
To that house?

08:36.933 --> 08:40.312
Why does she have to go back there?
Please, explain it to me.

08:41.104 --> 08:43.482
I know she's special-- and you.

08:44.066 --> 08:46.568
But I don't understand.
So, please, tell me.

08:51.365 --> 08:54.701
Leanne's always wearing that
little plastic necklace that boy made her.

08:55.369 --> 08:57.579
Maybe we could try to get more out of her.

08:58.664 --> 09:02.209
You buried her alive, Dottie.
She might not be a reliable source.

09:03.544 --> 09:06.547
Well, he mustn't get to her.
They'll scheme. They'll join forces.

09:06.630 --> 09:08.465
Your nephew's life is in the balance.

09:11.802 --> 09:13.262
I'm gonna go guard her door.

09:17.349 --> 09:18.976
Just need to top off first.

09:28.318 --> 09:32.406
Leanne... has a rebellious streak.

09:34.116 --> 09:36.285
Present from childhood.

09:38.453 --> 09:39.872
It's worrisome.

09:41.498 --> 09:45.294
She often strays from our...

09:46.670 --> 09:48.380
communal edicts.

09:50.340 --> 09:51.341
And...

09:52.342 --> 09:55.137
you mean communal as in what community?

09:55.220 --> 09:56.722
You know who we are.

09:57.347 --> 10:00.017
-No, I don't.
-You do.

10:00.100 --> 10:02.186
You just pretend not to.

10:02.853 --> 10:06.190
George, I have no fucking idea
who you are.

10:10.110 --> 10:11.820
We are all amongst you.

10:12.905 --> 10:15.115
Though we try not to take up space.

10:16.617 --> 10:21.538
You might see us on street corners,
under overpasses.

10:22.623 --> 10:25.834
We are the ones who have been given

10:25.918 --> 10:28.879
a second chance at life.

10:30.214 --> 10:35.427
And we use it to enact God's divine plan.

10:36.512 --> 10:38.222
To help others.

10:41.225 --> 10:44.102
But-- Wait. So you're saying
you're a fucking--

10:44.186 --> 10:48.941
But we can only help
the people we are told to help,

10:49.608 --> 10:51.276
and Leanne disobeys.

10:52.903 --> 10:56.657
She has a bad habit of being headstrong,

10:56.740 --> 10:58.825
of exercising free will.

11:02.663 --> 11:03.705
Jericho.

11:05.165 --> 11:06.208
That was his name?

11:08.252 --> 11:09.253
Jericho.

11:10.254 --> 11:12.256
Bringing him here,

11:12.881 --> 11:14.883
coming here in the first place...

11:15.884 --> 11:17.928
That was not her call to make.

11:19.179 --> 11:21.849
She was not following his rules.

11:22.474 --> 11:24.685
That's why the baby couldn't stay.

11:27.396 --> 11:28.397
And...

11:29.523 --> 11:34.194
then she meddled further.
Look at the signs.

11:36.029 --> 11:38.866
But what can I do? How do I fix it?

11:40.325 --> 11:41.326
I miss him.

11:43.203 --> 11:47.165
Your only hope is to take her back
to where she is needed.

11:47.833 --> 11:49.543
Where she was placed.

11:51.086 --> 11:52.671
And pray for forgiveness.

11:54.965 --> 11:56.800
Forgiveness for what?

11:58.844 --> 12:00.512
You know that too.

12:13.525 --> 12:15.569
-Hello.
-Is this Sean Turner?

12:15.652 --> 12:16.987
-Yes.
-Hi, I'm Taylor,

12:17.070 --> 12:20.115
calling from Gourmet Gauntlet.
Are you familiar with the show?

12:20.199 --> 12:24.077
Yeah, I've caught a few episodes.
I'm a big fan. "Your journey's over."

12:24.161 --> 12:27.372
Exactly. How would you like to be
a part of season two?

12:27.456 --> 12:29.875
-Wow. Really?
-Yes, as our head judge.

12:29.958 --> 12:32.044
Me? Stop. The head judge?

12:32.753 --> 12:34.171
Yeah, that would be incredible.

12:34.254 --> 12:36.423
That's awesome.
We shoot in LA in a few weeks' time.

12:36.507 --> 12:38.217
I'll have the lawyers work up
the paperwork.

12:38.300 --> 12:40.511
Yeah, thing is,
I can't leave home right now.

12:40.594 --> 12:43.430
If it was shooting in Philly,
I could make that work, but--

12:44.306 --> 12:45.891
Yeah, we have a two-month-old.

12:45.974 --> 12:49.019
-Yeah, hands full.
-Yeah. Exactly.

12:54.858 --> 12:58.070
If you return her, Sean...

12:59.154 --> 13:00.781
make things right...

13:05.327 --> 13:08.330
I'll undo what she did.

13:11.834 --> 13:13.502
I'll heal you.

13:15.379 --> 13:18.757
That's how you'll be reunited with him.

13:33.313 --> 13:35.399
Where are you going? Where's he going?

13:35.482 --> 13:37.109
He's making me a salve.

13:38.944 --> 13:41.655
Okay. And? Anything?

13:41.738 --> 13:44.199
Not really. All he wants is Leanne.

13:44.283 --> 13:46.159
And yet he's going off to play doctor.

13:46.243 --> 13:47.536
Don't ask me to explain him.

13:48.829 --> 13:52.249
What we need to do
is get in touch with May Markham.

13:52.916 --> 13:55.919
She is obviously the one
who makes the decisions here.

13:57.129 --> 13:58.547
Well, how do we do that?

13:58.630 --> 14:01.842
-I don't know. Get his phone?
-I doubt he has one.

14:01.925 --> 14:04.761
He doesn't seem to have anything
apart from that suit he got married in

14:04.845 --> 14:05.888
and my Italian shoes.

14:07.472 --> 14:10.017
Well, what else
did he say to you in there?

14:10.100 --> 14:12.060
Nothing really. He just...

14:12.144 --> 14:14.938
Well, he kept insisting that Leanne
should be back at that Marino--

14:15.022 --> 14:18.817
Oh, my God. If I have to hear about
this fucking disabled woman one more time.

14:18.901 --> 14:21.069
He mentioned divine repercussions.

14:21.153 --> 14:23.030
What? That's priceless.

14:23.113 --> 14:26.408
What? Boils? Locusts? A flood?

14:26.491 --> 14:29.119
-Well, I know, but--
-But what?

14:32.456 --> 14:34.875
Well, the cellar,
the day after we brought her here.

14:38.420 --> 14:41.507
I don't like the words that are coming out
of your mouth right now, Sean.

14:42.925 --> 14:47.095
If you think he gets Leanne
before I have my baby back in my arms...

14:47.179 --> 14:48.514
No, I know.

14:48.597 --> 14:51.266
If you believe what he says,
you're as crazy as they are.

14:51.350 --> 14:52.559
I don't believe him.

14:54.144 --> 14:55.854
You made some great strides, Sean,

14:55.938 --> 14:57.648
but I will take it from here.

15:27.010 --> 15:28.512
I'm stating the fucking obvious,

15:28.595 --> 15:30.180
but your house isn't equipped

15:30.264 --> 15:32.558
for the number of prisoners
it currently accommodates.

15:32.641 --> 15:34.059
He's not a fucking prisoner.

15:34.142 --> 15:37.104
He'd have to get past Dorothy first,
so he is our prisoner.

15:38.313 --> 15:39.898
Much like Rapunzel in there.

15:40.607 --> 15:42.025
I need to talk to her.

15:44.152 --> 15:47.072
She's not the sweet child
you think she is, Sean.

15:47.155 --> 15:49.408
Oh, no? So what is she then?

15:50.284 --> 15:52.411
I'm serious, Julian. What the fuck is she?

16:00.794 --> 16:02.629
What was he saying about me?

16:03.714 --> 16:04.840
My uncle.

16:05.507 --> 16:06.508
Nothing.

16:07.259 --> 16:08.468
I heard you.

16:10.721 --> 16:13.599
It's not nice to talk about people
behind their backs.

16:13.682 --> 16:16.518
He said we have to return you
to where we found you.

16:16.602 --> 16:18.687
He said you're needed there, so...

16:19.813 --> 16:21.023
And you believe him?

16:21.940 --> 16:23.567
I don't know what I believe.

16:51.553 --> 16:56.225
Did you disobey your aunt and uncle
when you first came to us?

16:59.853 --> 17:01.855
So you came because you wanted to help?

17:03.398 --> 17:05.608
Please, we need your help right now.

17:07.486 --> 17:09.530
I already told you.

17:11.949 --> 17:14.492
I don't think
that Jericho can come home, Sean.

17:14.576 --> 17:17.412
But maybe he can. I think we can fix it.

17:30.300 --> 17:33.220
Never interrupt a man in prayer.

17:37.015 --> 17:41.562
Do you know what $200,000
can buy you these days?

17:42.813 --> 17:45.440
I mean, not you,
because you have no need for anything,

17:45.524 --> 17:48.068
but in the actual world...

17:49.278 --> 17:51.738
this money could help
a lot of disadvantaged people.

17:53.073 --> 17:57.619
Feed them. Build huts. Whatever.

17:59.329 --> 18:01.748
Choose any charity. Give to the poor.

18:33.530 --> 18:35.240
You are impossible!

18:35.324 --> 18:39.369
"He who trusts in his riches shall fall,

18:39.453 --> 18:43.749
but the righteous shall flourish
as the green leaf."

18:45.167 --> 18:47.252
How do you call yourself righteous?

18:48.086 --> 18:49.796
You kidnapped my son.

19:06.146 --> 19:08.565
She was down here?

19:11.068 --> 19:12.069
No.

19:15.531 --> 19:17.324
I don't know. Maybe.

19:18.867 --> 19:20.494
It's progressing.

19:22.037 --> 19:24.623
Her presence here is an infection.

19:26.083 --> 19:27.543
It's spreading.

19:28.168 --> 19:31.338
-What hath she wrought?
-No, I--

19:32.548 --> 19:36.343
-I don't think that's what that is.
-Then how do you explain it?

19:39.930 --> 19:41.139
What did she tell you?

19:42.391 --> 19:44.977
We have to take her back
to the house tonight.

19:45.060 --> 19:47.104
That's where they're holding il bambino?

19:47.604 --> 19:49.940
Can't keep them both here.
You said it yourself.

19:50.023 --> 19:53.318
-He's more useful than she is.
-So we keep the uncle, let Leanne walk.

19:54.570 --> 19:56.196
At least we'll know where she is.

19:56.280 --> 20:00.033
-Dorothy's not gonna buy this plan.
-That's why we're not gonna tell her.

20:00.117 --> 20:02.119
I'm just gonna do it,
and you're gonna help me.

20:02.202 --> 20:03.412
The fuck I am.

20:04.204 --> 20:07.332
You're gonna distract her.
You'll be the decoy.

20:10.711 --> 20:12.546
Pray with me.

20:15.257 --> 20:16.258
No.

20:17.634 --> 20:21.722
Pray with me
to set her back on the right path.

20:21.805 --> 20:23.140
Pray for her?

20:23.724 --> 20:25.559
Not on your fucking life.

20:25.642 --> 20:28.103
You must surrender, Dorothy.

20:28.187 --> 20:29.730
Surrender to what?

20:29.813 --> 20:33.775
To a god who would let your
precious flower run off with my child?

20:33.859 --> 20:35.986
-Hey! Get your hands off of her!
-Thou--

20:36.069 --> 20:38.655
-Juju, be careful.
-What'd you say to him?

20:39.615 --> 20:40.616
Nothing.

20:41.158 --> 20:42.701
What the fuck is this?

20:42.784 --> 20:45.996
Fuck! There's mud all over it!

20:46.747 --> 20:49.750
You weep for your filthy cash.

20:50.501 --> 20:52.753
Weep for what you have done.

20:57.674 --> 21:00.636
Tonight, a peanut butter
in your local grocery store

21:00.719 --> 21:03.680
that just might be giving you cancer.

21:03.764 --> 21:05.849
-Peanut butter?
-I know.

21:05.933 --> 21:08.185
Can't even enjoy a good old-fashioned...

21:08.268 --> 21:09.978
-Okay, come on.
-Wait. Wait.

21:11.563 --> 21:12.898
I'll go with you.

21:13.941 --> 21:16.610
But you need to promise
to take me somewhere else.

21:18.487 --> 21:20.864
I need you to drive me
where they can't find me.

21:23.116 --> 21:26.495
Anywhere, but far away.

21:28.038 --> 21:29.665
Okay? Promise me.

21:30.499 --> 21:32.793
-But your uncle, he said--
-Whatever he said...

21:33.585 --> 21:35.587
he won't bring Jericho back.

21:38.131 --> 21:40.717
Please. Please, far away.

21:43.178 --> 21:44.388
I promise.

21:45.347 --> 21:46.557
You're lying.

21:48.433 --> 21:49.810
Sean!

21:52.980 --> 21:53.981
Sean!

22:02.656 --> 22:03.657
Hello?

22:04.074 --> 22:07.286
Sean, it's Taylor from Gourmet Gauntlet,
returning your call.

22:09.329 --> 22:11.081
Can you hold him so I can get my shoes?

22:11.164 --> 22:14.126
-Have I caught you at a bad time?
-One second, Taylor.

22:17.838 --> 22:20.799
-Hi, Taylor? You still there?
-Yeah, I'm here.

22:20.883 --> 22:23.677
Yeah, I'm glad you called.
Thanks for getting back to me.

22:23.760 --> 22:29.016
Turns out things have shifted on my end,
so I'll be able to make LA work.

22:29.099 --> 22:33.520
-But I thought you couldn't leave Philly.
-No, no, no. Yeah, LA will be fine.

22:33.604 --> 22:35.355
That's great news.

22:38.775 --> 22:42.279
...a woman who saved
a cat by jumping into a swimming pool.

22:42.362 --> 22:45.741
Well, on a more serious note,
our big story of the night,

22:45.824 --> 22:49.369
we go to Isabelle live in West Chester
for more.

22:49.453 --> 22:50.662
I promise.

22:51.413 --> 22:53.707
This is Isabelle Carrick
coming to you live

22:53.790 --> 22:56.168
from outside the Marino estate
in West Chester

22:56.251 --> 22:58.378
where tragedy has struck the community.

22:58.462 --> 23:01.757
We don't know much,
but there were reports of gunfire.

23:04.551 --> 23:09.515
If she does not leave this house--

23:09.598 --> 23:10.766
I don't care!

23:10.849 --> 23:13.018
I don't care what happens.

23:13.393 --> 23:17.064
Nothing matters if I don't have my son.

23:17.147 --> 23:20.526
You must own the part you played, Dorothy.

23:20.609 --> 23:22.819
I didn't do anything to her
she didn't deserve.

23:23.529 --> 23:26.406
And if Sean hadn't come down here,
I would've left her in there!

23:29.576 --> 23:30.744
What have you done?

23:32.538 --> 23:33.872
Don't you realize

23:34.748 --> 23:37.543
you will never be reunited
with Jericho now?

23:38.460 --> 23:43.549
"For whosoever keeps the law
and yet stumbles at just one point...

23:43.632 --> 23:45.425
If you quote scripture at me

23:45.509 --> 23:48.345
-one more fucking time!
-...is guilty of breaking all of it!"

24:05.612 --> 24:07.197
Sean. Sean, what are you doing?

24:07.281 --> 24:08.740
There seems to be
a lot of police out there

24:08.824 --> 24:11.618
as multiple city departments try to figure
out what happened.

24:12.661 --> 24:15.414
News crews
are being kept at bay and, as you can see.

24:15.497 --> 24:18.876
police cars and ambulances
are still arriving on the scene.

24:19.459 --> 24:23.797
We're told neighbors reported a round
of gunshots at 1:00 in the morning,

24:23.881 --> 24:25.340
just half an hour ago.

24:36.351 --> 24:38.395
The body count is still uncertain.

24:39.354 --> 24:42.774
Authorities have yet to release
information on the whereabouts

24:42.858 --> 24:45.194
or safety of the family inside.

24:45.277 --> 24:49.031
More on this case as it develops.
I'm Isabelle Carrick, 8 News.

24:50.782 --> 24:53.619
Look what you have done.
