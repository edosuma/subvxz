It's called a chopper,

are holding giant machine guns.

Yeah, that is exactly correct.

So two of these guys murdered
in the past two days?

to the missing money.

04:20.192 --> 04:22.227
Circumstances do suggest
a connection.

- You were right.
- Yes! Did you get it, Boyle?

Oh, the camera
was in selfie mode,

04:26.733 --> 04:28.133
but I look super proud of you.

04:28.134 --> 04:30.736

has turned out to be important,

04:30.737 --> 04:32.004

in her office,

04:35.341 --> 04:37.175

to Major Crimes.

04:37.210 --> 04:38.410
No, no, no.
We can't let that happen.

04:38.411 --> 04:39.378
Sir, we have to do something.

04:39.412 --> 04:40.512
Fine.
I'll seduce her.

04:40.513 --> 04:41.713
I'll just put on my bike shorts

04:41.714 --> 04:43.382

of the quad cities.

04:43.383 --> 04:45.150
No. No.
That's not what I meant.

04:45.151 --> 04:46.351
I meant we have to fight her.

04:46.386 --> 04:48.320
We're not gonna fight her.
She's the devil.

And you don't dance with the devil,
because you get burned.

04:52.091 --> 04:53.492
Also, because
in Madeline's case,

04:53.493 --> 04:56.328
she has no rhythm and her hands
are like little rat claws.

04:56.362 --> 04:59.364
If she wants the case,
it's hers.

04:59.365 --> 05:01.300

you're turning this murder scene

Well, some say Latin
is a dead language,

06:09.002 --> 06:12.204
How do you like
my new office? 20th floor.

06:12.238 --> 06:13.839
Yes, I never thought
I'd see you this high

06:13.840 --> 06:14.973
without a broom under you.

06:14.974 --> 06:16.208
Enough niceties.

06:16.242 --> 06:19.111
Thanks, but I'm actually
fine standing.

06:19.112 --> 06:22.881
I could stay in these
bad boys all day.

06:22.882 --> 06:24.850
So two members
of the Fulton Street Four

06:24.851 --> 06:26.818
have been murdered...
sounds like a big case.

06:26.853 --> 06:28.820
No, it's actually the opposite.

06:28.821 --> 06:30.989
Pretty much an NBT sitch.

06:30.990 --> 06:32.558
No big thang.

06:32.559 --> 06:35.460
The word is "thing,"
and the thing is big.

06:35.461 --> 06:37.996
We believe someone is after
the missing $21 million,

06:37.997 --> 06:40.465
and solving this murder
could lead us to the money.

06:40.500 --> 06:42.801
Sure, but that money's,
like, 25 years old.

06:42.802 --> 06:44.269
It's probably not
even good anymore.

06:44.304 --> 06:46.572
[grunts] Sorry. Cramped up.

06:46.606 --> 06:49.308
This is a very important case,
Raymond,

06:49.309 --> 06:51.643
to me, and to the city
of New York.

06:51.644 --> 06:53.779
I'm not sure the Nine-Nine
has the resources

06:53.780 --> 06:55.447
to deal with something
of this magnitude.

06:55.481 --> 06:57.282
I understand the politics.

06:57.283 --> 06:59.084
This is a high-profile case.

06:59.085 --> 07:00.752
Do what you must.

07:00.787 --> 07:02.521
What I was going to say is,

07:02.522 --> 07:04.356
since you don't have
the resources,

07:04.357 --> 07:05.637
I'll give you anything you need.

07:05.658 --> 07:07.326
The case is yours.
You have my full support.

07:07.360 --> 07:08.393
What?

07:08.394 --> 07:11.926
He meant that more excited.
Like, "What!"

07:12.023 --> 07:15.669
Okay, two of
the Fulton Street Four are dead.

07:15.704 --> 07:18.072
My hunch... one of them
is killing off his co-scums

07:18.073 --> 07:19.707
so he can keep the money
for his scum-self.

07:19.741 --> 07:21.208
We'll start with Reggie Bludsoe.

07:21.209 --> 07:23.310
He listed a Brooklyn address
with his parole officer.

07:23.345 --> 07:24.778
We're gonna nail
this son of a bitch.

07:24.779 --> 07:25.913
Unless he's innocent...

07:25.914 --> 07:27.248
then we're gonna have
the son of a bitch.

07:27.282 --> 07:28.949
Either way, this case
is gonna be awesome.

07:28.950 --> 07:31.719
Peralta, I'm putting myself
on this investigation with you.

07:31.753 --> 07:33.487
- What? Why?
- Wuntch is up to something.

07:33.488 --> 07:35.756
There's only one reason why
she would let us keep this case.

07:35.791 --> 07:37.024
She took one look at me
and said,

07:37.025 --> 07:38.692
"That's the guy I want
flying my chopper."

07:38.693 --> 07:39.860
You know how to fly a chopper?

07:39.861 --> 07:41.095
How hard could it be?

07:41.096 --> 07:42.496
It's just a big fan
that goes in the sky.

07:42.497 --> 07:44.532
She let us keep this case
because she wants us to fail.

07:44.566 --> 07:46.500
I'm coming along
so that you don't waste

07:46.501 --> 07:48.769
time and resources
turning this investigation

07:48.770 --> 07:50.371
into another Ron McClane movie.

07:50.405 --> 07:52.606
Oh, you know it's John McClane.

07:52.607 --> 07:55.109
I've made my decision.
End of discussion.

07:55.143 --> 07:56.277
All right, fine.

07:56.278 --> 07:57.778
But you're gonna have
to take your own car.

07:57.779 --> 07:59.947
I signed out that drug dealer's
Lamborghini from the impound.

07:59.948 --> 08:01.015
It only has two seats.

08:01.049 --> 08:02.616
I saw that you had made
that request.

08:02.617 --> 08:04.351
I changed it
to a sensible sedan.

08:04.386 --> 08:05.953
Okay, but the sunroof
stays open.

08:05.987 --> 08:07.121
There is no sunroof.

08:07.155 --> 08:09.190
Why did you even become a cop?

08:09.224 --> 08:11.592
Oh, great job, kids.

08:11.593 --> 08:13.794
Don't solve too many crimes
and put me out of business.

08:13.829 --> 08:15.963
Terry's got to pay the rent.
[laughs]

08:17.566 --> 08:20.301
Dr. Susman wants
a private chat with me.

08:20.335 --> 08:22.369
Thanks for warming her up,
Santiago.

08:22.404 --> 08:23.804
They didn't give
eighth grade Amy

08:23.805 --> 08:26.307
the key to the teacher's lounge
just for nothing.

08:26.308 --> 08:28.409
I stocked their fridge
and cleaned up after them.

08:28.443 --> 08:30.945
Great. So can you take over
with the kids for a minute?

08:30.979 --> 08:32.379
They're done with this activity.

08:32.380 --> 08:35.716
Of course.
I am amazing with kids.

08:35.717 --> 08:38.219
[laughs nervously] Okay.

08:38.220 --> 08:39.419
I am terrible with kids.

08:39.421 --> 08:41.322
I haven't listened to rap music
in three years.

08:41.323 --> 08:43.157
I don't know the lingo.
You have to do this.

08:43.158 --> 08:45.426
I can't... McKenzie is
in the bathroom right now

08:45.427 --> 08:48.295
freaking out because Kelsey S.
Made out with Hayes

08:48.296 --> 08:50.931
even though she knows
Brianna's into him.

08:50.966 --> 08:53.167
So unless you want
the spring dance

08:53.168 --> 08:57.004
to be a total drama fest,
I have to be there for her.

08:57.005 --> 08:59.573
Honestly, you should show them
a picture of a dead body.

08:59.574 --> 09:03.377
No! Rosa, Terry said
to keep it kid-friendly.

09:03.378 --> 09:06.280
Okay, I'll just show them
the stuff that I was into

09:06.281 --> 09:07.348
when I was their age.

09:07.349 --> 09:09.083
- I'm done.
- What do we do now?

09:09.084 --> 09:11.352
- What's next?
- Hello, friends.

09:11.386 --> 09:13.587
Who here would like to see
a presentation

09:13.588 --> 09:14.789
about crime statistics

09:14.790 --> 09:17.358
as a function
of demographics and time?

09:21.063 --> 09:22.663
Who wants to see
a picture of a dead body?

09:22.697 --> 09:24.131
(all) Me!

09:27.135 --> 09:28.536
Bludsoe lives at the end
of his hall.

09:28.570 --> 09:31.205
Hmm... I would have preferred
an abandoned lighthouse

09:31.206 --> 09:33.641
or a dilapidated barn, but I can
embellish in my memoirs.

09:33.675 --> 09:35.076
Oh, I can't wait
to read that book.

09:35.077 --> 09:36.610
What are you gonna call it?

09:36.611 --> 09:38.345
[in gravelly voice]
"Go Ahead, Jake My Day."

09:38.380 --> 09:41.982
No, yours is much better.

09:41.983 --> 09:43.684
"Case Closed, Jake Open."

09:43.718 --> 09:44.852
- Wow.
- I know.

09:44.886 --> 09:46.220
I said yours was better.

09:46.221 --> 09:47.655
Whatever.
Let's just do this.

09:52.027 --> 09:53.060
[pounding]

09:53.061 --> 09:54.628
NYPD. Open up.

09:56.932 --> 09:58.232
[clock clicking open]

10:01.803 --> 10:02.903
Hey, check it out.

10:02.904 --> 10:04.138
(Jake) Half-packed suitcase.

10:04.139 --> 10:05.673
Looks like Bludsoe
was planning a trip

10:05.674 --> 10:07.174
until he got
interrupted by someone.

10:07.175 --> 10:08.743
- Or something.
- Like what?

10:08.744 --> 10:10.478
I don't know... I just thought
it would help the intrigue.

10:10.512 --> 10:11.579
It did.

10:11.580 --> 10:12.646
That's enough chitchat already.

10:12.681 --> 10:14.048
Come on, how many people
have to get killed

10:14.049 --> 10:15.416
before you start having fun?

10:15.417 --> 10:17.418
You do know it's our job
to stop the killing, right?

10:17.419 --> 10:19.186
Wait a second.
[sniffs]

10:19.187 --> 10:20.688
I think I smell a dead body.

10:20.689 --> 10:22.223
[sniffs]

10:22.224 --> 10:25.092
[clears throat]
Nope. My mistake.

10:25.127 --> 10:26.494
Wait! Don't close that.

10:26.528 --> 10:27.995
(Jake) Look. Handprint.

10:28.029 --> 10:30.331
That's a fake wall.

10:30.332 --> 10:31.632
NYPD.

10:31.633 --> 10:33.701
Come out with your hands
on your head.

10:33.702 --> 10:35.403
Don't shoot!
Don't shoot.

10:35.404 --> 10:36.871
He's trying to kill me.

10:36.905 --> 10:39.340
So I guess, if I had
to sum them up,

10:39.341 --> 10:41.208
Cagney is the intellectual one,

10:41.243 --> 10:45.780
whereas Lacey is more
of your traditional prodigy.

10:45.814 --> 10:48.282
Well, your daughters
sound great.

10:48.283 --> 10:51.085
You know, I'm gonna look over
their applications again.

10:51.119 --> 10:52.586
Oh, no, that's not necessary.

10:52.587 --> 10:53.821
It's Jeffords with two Fs.

10:53.822 --> 10:56.424
But what really matters
is that your students

10:56.425 --> 10:58.459
have an amazing
experience here today.

10:58.493 --> 11:01.128
They are.

11:01.129 --> 11:03.130
Look, Rosa.
Sarge is here.

11:03.165 --> 11:04.265
Oh, my God.

11:04.266 --> 11:06.267
[shrieking horror music]

11:06.301 --> 11:08.069
Children, get out
of this room immediately.

11:08.103 --> 11:09.270
(Dr. Susman) Let's go.

11:09.271 --> 11:11.038
(whispering angrily)
What the hell, guys?

11:11.039 --> 11:12.073
They're 12 years old.

11:12.074 --> 11:14.375
I would've killed to have seen
a bag of hands at that age.

11:14.376 --> 11:16.744
I'm so sorry... I tired to be
myself and they hated it.

11:16.778 --> 11:19.513
- Where were you?
- Saving the day.

11:19.514 --> 11:21.115
Hayes is out of the picture.

11:21.116 --> 11:24.218
The McKenzie/Kelsey S.
Beef is squashed,

11:24.219 --> 11:26.153
and Brianna's going
to the dance with Aidan,

11:26.154 --> 11:28.589
who's a much better match
for her anyway, BT-dubs.

11:28.590 --> 11:30.758
How does any of that help me?

11:30.792 --> 11:33.394
- Dr. Susman...
- Good-bye, Sergeant Jeffords.

11:33.395 --> 11:35.129
I think this experience has been

11:35.130 --> 11:36.497
more than enough
for the children.

11:36.531 --> 11:37.965
We're done here.

11:38.000 --> 11:40.001
I was walking home
from the coffee shop.

11:40.035 --> 11:41.769
I have a job
bussing tables there.

11:41.803 --> 11:45.006
Anyway, the next thing I know,
Mikey D has a gun in my back.

11:45.040 --> 11:46.474
Michael D'Angelo,
the other member

11:46.475 --> 11:47.641
of the Fulton Street Four.

11:47.676 --> 11:49.610
Yes, believe it or not,
I familiarized myself

11:49.611 --> 11:51.379
with the names
of all two suspects

11:51.380 --> 11:53.581
in this high-profile homicide
we're investigating.

11:53.615 --> 11:55.850
I fought him off,
but he got my key.

11:55.884 --> 11:56.984
What's the key for?

11:57.019 --> 11:58.319
Each of us had one,

11:58.320 --> 12:00.321
and you needed all four
to open the safe.

12:00.355 --> 12:02.023
And what's in the safe?

12:02.057 --> 12:03.657
The $21 million.

12:03.658 --> 12:04.759
Bing... pot...

12:04.760 --> 12:05.960
Nope... I was gonna say bingo,

12:05.961 --> 12:07.328
but then I was like,
"Jackpot's better,"

12:07.329 --> 12:09.463
but then it was too late;
I was halfway through the word.

12:09.498 --> 12:11.298
Bingpot works.
It's taking off.

12:11.333 --> 12:13.100
It's taking off.

12:13.101 --> 12:16.337
Captain, D'Angelo
has a place upstate.

12:16.371 --> 12:18.506
The local sheriff says there's
a car in the driveway right now.

12:18.507 --> 12:19.774
He must be there.

12:19.808 --> 12:21.409
Okay, they're gonna have to
raid the place without us.

12:21.410 --> 12:22.610
It'll take us two hours
to get up there.

12:22.644 --> 12:23.644
Or we could take...

12:23.645 --> 12:24.879
We are not taking a helicopter.

12:24.880 --> 12:26.280
You know I was
gonna say chopper.

12:26.281 --> 12:27.915
Look, Peralta,
I know you're having fun,

12:27.916 --> 12:29.350
but a helicopter
is exactly the kind

12:29.351 --> 12:31.152
of wasteful expenditure
that Wuntch will use

12:31.153 --> 12:32.687
to bury me
if something goes wrong.

12:32.688 --> 12:34.188
- Okay, sir...
- Or...

12:34.189 --> 12:37.325
It's the kind of thing
she'll crucify me for not getting.

12:37.326 --> 12:38.859
"You could've had
a chopper, Raymond.

12:38.860 --> 12:40.161
"Why didn't you take advantage?

12:40.162 --> 12:41.962
Just a minute...
my cauldron's boiling over."

12:41.963 --> 12:44.131
Yeah, but what
she actually said was,

12:44.166 --> 12:46.133
[in Boston accent]
"Chopper's yours, Peralta."

12:46.134 --> 12:47.468
Your impression was better.

12:47.469 --> 12:48.736
What did you do?

12:48.737 --> 12:50.571
She may have called me
and I may have briefed her

12:50.572 --> 12:51.872
and she may have
said yes to the chopper

12:51.873 --> 12:53.674
because it's definitely
on its way right now!

12:53.675 --> 12:55.570
I call middle seat!

12:57.606 --> 12:58.673
(Jake) Whoo!

12:58.674 --> 13:01.810
This is awesome!

13:01.844 --> 13:04.713
Okay, just so we're clear,
from this point forward,

13:04.747 --> 13:06.581
my call sign
will be Death Blade.

13:06.615 --> 13:08.249
And I'll be Rum Tum Tugger.

13:08.284 --> 13:10.719
No, Boyle.
No characters from <i> Cats.</i>

13:10.720 --> 13:12.487

Think of something scary.

13:12.521 --> 13:13.588
Adolf Hitler.

13:13.622 --> 13:14.856
No!

13:14.857 --> 13:17.158
You will be...
Sidewinder.

13:17.193 --> 13:19.027
All right, but I'm more scared
of Hitler.

13:19.028 --> 13:20.829
How about you, Captain?
What's your call sign?

13:20.863 --> 13:22.597
I will be Captain Raymond Holt.

13:22.598 --> 13:24.165
Uh-huh, I knew
you wouldn't play ball.

13:24.200 --> 13:26.668
And that is why your call sign
is Wet Blanket.

13:26.702 --> 13:29.371
Sidewinder, this is Death Blade.

13:29.372 --> 13:31.473
Do you copy, Sidewinder?
Over.

13:31.474 --> 13:33.475
This is Sidewinder, Death Blade.

13:33.476 --> 13:35.377
I read you loud and clear.
Over.

13:35.378 --> 13:37.579
Do you have a 20
on Wet Blanket, Sidewinder?

13:37.580 --> 13:38.613
Over.

13:38.614 --> 13:40.649
- I do have a visual...
- Over.

13:40.650 --> 13:43.118
All right, look, Captain,
Wuntch said that we could have

13:43.119 --> 13:44.452
anything we needed
to solve this case.

13:44.487 --> 13:45.754
Yes, but why?

13:45.788 --> 13:48.356
To catch a murder
who stole $21 million.

13:48.391 --> 13:50.325
No, it's so that when
we do fail,

13:50.326 --> 13:53.428
it'll be that much
more spectacular.

13:53.429 --> 13:55.964
If we don't get D'Angelo,
my career is over.

13:55.998 --> 14:01.236
But if we do catch him,
your career will really take off.

14:01.237 --> 14:03.271
Chopper pun!

14:03.306 --> 14:06.274
Dr. Susman, I am so, so sorry.

14:06.275 --> 14:08.076
Please don't hold this
against my daughters.

14:08.077 --> 14:09.878
I would never do that.

14:09.879 --> 14:11.179
Preschool admissions are based

14:11.180 --> 14:12.480
on what we think of the parents.

14:12.515 --> 14:13.548
Oh, no.

14:13.549 --> 14:14.616
Dr. Susman...

14:14.617 --> 14:15.884
Nancy, if I may...

14:15.918 --> 14:17.852
- You may not.
- Okay.

14:17.853 --> 14:20.622
Look, our methods may have been
a little unorthodox,

14:20.623 --> 14:22.057
and perhaps a little...

14:22.091 --> 14:23.425
Graphic and disgusting.

14:23.459 --> 14:25.360
I was gonna go with yucky...

14:25.361 --> 14:27.562
But these kids had fun today.

14:27.596 --> 14:28.797
And they learned a lot.

14:28.798 --> 14:30.432
Tricia, what's Luminol?

14:30.466 --> 14:32.467
It's used to look for blood
in a crime scene.

14:32.468 --> 14:34.169
Even if a criminal
tried to clean it up,

14:34.170 --> 14:36.171
the iron in blood
makes the chemical glow.

14:36.205 --> 14:38.607
And, Bobby, what's enucleation?

14:38.641 --> 14:40.475
It's when someone
pops your eyeball out.

14:40.509 --> 14:42.344
Probably should've used
a less gross example.

14:42.345 --> 14:43.578
The point is,

14:43.579 --> 14:45.880
this is exactly the kind
of educational experience

14:45.881 --> 14:47.449
I loved about my magnet school.

14:47.483 --> 14:49.284
Well, there's something
to be said for that.

14:49.285 --> 14:52.754
Also, and more importantly,
I got McKenzie and Brianna

14:52.755 --> 14:54.356
to stop hating on Kelsey S.

14:54.357 --> 14:56.758
And now they're best friends...
you're welcome.

14:56.759 --> 14:58.159
Wow, that's actually impressive.

14:58.160 --> 14:59.160
Thank you.

14:59.195 --> 15:00.695
(Terry) So, Dr. Susman,

15:00.696 --> 15:03.365
let's just call this field trip
what it was...

15:03.366 --> 15:04.532
a huge success.

15:04.567 --> 15:06.434
It was... interesting.

15:06.469 --> 15:08.270
(Bobby) I saw a prostitute.

$21 million coming

18:50.004 --> 18:51.538

access to that building.

the money's hidden.
