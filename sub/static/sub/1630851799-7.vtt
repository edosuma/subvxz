35:04.678 --> 35:09.055
- I've had to verify my picture
like five times

35:09.132 --> 35:11.724
because people think
I'm catfishing them

35:11.801 --> 35:13.351
because they're like, "Really?"

35:13.428 --> 35:15.937
- I'm just gonna say one thing.
Garcelle, you're hot as hell.

35:15.948 --> 35:17.438
- Yeah, you are.
- Oh, thank you.

35:17.449 --> 35:19.023
- She is. And she's telling me
how you have

35:19.100 --> 35:21.785
to get online to date.
And I'm like, "What?!"

35:21.862 --> 35:23.903
- You have to have a blue check
before you check this.

35:23.980 --> 35:26.072
- Okay.
- You're gonna have a few

35:26.149 --> 35:27.440
zeroes before you check this.

35:27.517 --> 35:30.201
(BLEEP) the blue check.
Send me your financials,

35:30.278 --> 35:32.245
and then we'll know if
we're ----in' or not.

35:32.322 --> 35:33.705
[laughter]

35:33.781 --> 35:36.124
- You don't know
what's gonna last forever.

35:36.135 --> 35:37.634
- No, we don't.
- Nothing lasts--

35:37.711 --> 35:39.294
- ♪ Forever ♪
- That's it.

35:39.304 --> 35:42.305
- Oh, that was cute, Thomasina.
- Is that right?

35:42.382 --> 35:43.306
[laughter]

35:43.383 --> 35:45.308
- Tell us what Thomasina means?

35:45.385 --> 35:47.310
- Thomasina is like
Peeping Tom.

35:47.387 --> 35:48.928
- Oh, my God.

35:49.005 --> 35:53.308
- I really like kitty cat
or crazy cat lady is good.

35:53.318 --> 35:55.059
Those could be nicknames.

35:55.136 --> 35:57.395
- Peeping Thomasina.

35:57.472 --> 36:01.241
- But Peeping Thomasina,
that's just not my favorite.

36:04.354 --> 36:05.778
- The Peeping Tom thing

36:05.855 --> 36:07.906
I thought
was funny that you said that.

36:07.982 --> 36:10.834
- Kathy has been away.
So I filled her in,

36:10.911 --> 36:12.836
and I explained
the whole thing about Tahoe.

36:12.913 --> 36:14.229
- Yeah, okay.

36:14.231 --> 36:16.006
- I was just bringing
in a ----in' coat, man.

36:16.082 --> 36:17.165
- Yeah.

36:17.176 --> 36:18.958
- You know, like not
Peeping Tom,

36:19.035 --> 36:20.585
like what the hell?

36:20.662 --> 36:24.848
- The word "violated" gave the
implication that it was sexual.

36:24.925 --> 36:27.017
Like, it really did,
like it felt like that.

36:27.093 --> 36:28.852
- Look, I was naked.

36:28.929 --> 36:30.511
And I felt uncomfortable,
period.

36:30.522 --> 36:33.348
But I didn't make it sexual.

36:33.358 --> 36:35.141
- I've been in a public
bathroom going to pee

36:35.218 --> 36:37.936
and someone walked in,
and I didn't feel violated.

36:38.012 --> 36:39.863
I'm sure it wasn't fun
for them either. Okay?

36:39.940 --> 36:42.190
<i> There are so many other words</i>
<i> that Crystal could have used,</i>

36:42.201 --> 36:43.942
embarrassed, awkward,

36:44.018 --> 36:46.194
even say rude
that she walked in.

36:46.205 --> 36:47.871
But violated?

36:47.948 --> 36:51.032
If you're using that word
when you don't have clothes on,

36:51.043 --> 36:52.709
it means something
totally different.

36:52.786 --> 36:54.869
- Was it not the conversation
when we heard that story?

36:54.880 --> 36:56.037
- I did feel that way.

36:56.048 --> 36:57.881
- The word violation
actually means

36:57.958 --> 36:59.999
not respecting personal space,
which is how I felt.

37:00.076 --> 37:01.876
- Well, and it also means,
violation of privacy.

37:01.887 --> 37:03.053
- Correct.

37:03.129 --> 37:06.056
- Violation means
to abuse your privacy.

37:06.132 --> 37:09.059
A disrespect
of boundaries, period.

37:09.135 --> 37:14.889
Google it. Fail to respect
someone's privacy or rights.

37:14.900 --> 37:17.058
Don't hear the word sexual
at all.

37:17.069 --> 37:20.311
- I didn't do that, but okay.
- I felt that way. That's all.

37:20.388 --> 37:23.073
<i> - I did not feel violated</i>
<i> at all when Kathy</i>

37:23.149 --> 37:26.243
walked in on me while I was
on the phone half naked.

37:26.319 --> 37:29.829
- Hi, girl.
- Y'all, come on!

37:34.253 --> 37:37.495
<i> Seems to me like that's just</i>
<i> kind of normal on a girl trip.</i>

37:37.572 --> 37:41.374
So I don't know. Maybe Crystal
doesn't have real girlfriends.

37:41.451 --> 37:45.428
- To me, violation of privacy
has to be intentional.

37:45.505 --> 37:47.430
Her coming in not knowing

37:47.507 --> 37:50.433
that you're naked
can't be a violation.

37:50.510 --> 37:54.012
- Oh!
- Exactly. That's the truth.

37:54.088 --> 37:55.346
<i> Sutton is a good Southern girl</i>

37:55.423 --> 37:58.108
and she's very thoughtful,
very generous.

37:58.184 --> 38:00.277
<i> She didn't really mean</i>
<i> anything harmful.</i>

38:00.353 --> 38:01.853
<i> We all know how words</i>
<i> can get twisted</i>

38:01.929 --> 38:05.189
and something that's small
becomes much bigger

38:05.266 --> 38:07.942
and has now everyone involved.

38:07.953 --> 38:09.953
- Violation's a little strong.
- It's not.

38:10.030 --> 38:11.454
- Violation is strong.
- It's not.

38:11.531 --> 38:14.457
- Violation is a big word.
- Look it up. It's not.

38:14.534 --> 38:16.075
<i> - Oh, my God.</i>

38:16.152 --> 38:18.962
<i> We're talking about</i>
<i> such insignificant things.</i>

38:19.039 --> 38:22.299
Let's just bury the hatchet
so the group can move on.

38:22.375 --> 38:23.967
- For me,
if you walked in my room,

38:24.044 --> 38:25.418
I would be like, "Whoo-hoo!"
Right?

38:25.495 --> 38:27.470
- But here's the deal,
my reaction would be,

38:27.547 --> 38:29.213
"Oh, my God. I'm sorry."
Close the door.

38:29.290 --> 38:30.423
- Right.
- That did not happen.

38:30.500 --> 38:31.808
- Crystal are you up?

38:31.885 --> 38:35.094
- It was walking in,
and then you said,

38:35.171 --> 38:37.314
"Oh, I don't know
what you're doing over there."

38:43.563 --> 38:45.229
- That was not a--that
was not a--

38:45.306 --> 38:47.231
- Here's the thing, Crystal,
and I need to defend myself

38:47.308 --> 38:49.826
for two seconds.
I wanted to talk.

38:49.903 --> 38:52.904
I knocked, your light was on,
you were talking.

38:52.980 --> 38:54.572
I thought I heard you say,
"Come in."

38:54.649 --> 38:56.157
I didn't say anything creepy.

38:56.168 --> 38:57.325
- I don't want to talk
about it anymore.

38:57.336 --> 38:58.451
- It is so stupid!

38:58.528 --> 38:59.836
- But the reality is what it
is.

38:59.913 --> 39:01.120
- See now, I'm getting angry.

39:01.197 --> 39:02.497
- The reality is
what it is, Sutton.

39:02.507 --> 39:03.664
- And this is what you
do not want to happen.

39:03.675 --> 39:06.051
You do not want me
getting angry.

39:14.852 --> 39:18.096
<i> - The reality is what it is.</i>
<i> - See now, I'm getting angry.</i>

39:18.172 --> 39:19.472
- The reality is what
it is, Sutton.

39:19.549 --> 39:21.099
- And this is what you
do not want to happen.

39:21.175 --> 39:23.693
You do not want me
getting angry.

39:23.770 --> 39:26.437
You don't want me
getting angry.

39:26.514 --> 39:29.607
But see, I'm not emotionally
in a bad place.

39:29.684 --> 39:32.610
I'm not moving.
I'm not sad. I'm getting angry.

39:32.687 --> 39:34.487
- You moved a long time ago.
- I'm getting--

39:34.564 --> 39:38.208
- Stop blaming that.
- Oh, my God.

39:38.284 --> 39:40.284
Who are you?

39:40.361 --> 39:42.286
- I'm a person
who tells the truth.

39:42.363 --> 39:44.455
- I moved 2 1/2 weeks
before I got to Tahoe.

39:44.532 --> 39:47.041
So I was very vulnerable.
And I am sorry for that.

39:47.052 --> 39:50.128
And I've apologized for that.
But I'm not gonna sit here

39:50.204 --> 39:53.005
and let you make it look like
I was some weirdo.

39:53.082 --> 39:55.133
That's not what happened.
And you know it.

39:55.209 --> 39:56.467
You need to tell these people,

39:56.544 --> 39:58.136
all of these girls
that nothing weird happened

39:58.212 --> 40:01.064
and this is a [indistinct].
- I have been saying that!

40:01.141 --> 40:03.349
- So then we are all going
to agree on it

40:03.426 --> 40:05.017
because this is
about my reputation.

40:05.094 --> 40:06.236
- Sutton...
- It is about--

40:06.312 --> 40:07.562
- Hold on.
- No, no, no, ma'am.

40:07.572 --> 40:09.021
- Let's get real.

40:09.098 --> 40:10.648
- No, ma'am.
- Let's get real here.

40:10.725 --> 40:12.525
- Not once you start coming
after my personal reputation.

40:12.602 --> 40:14.652
- Then just own
that you said that to me.

40:14.729 --> 40:16.079
- I didn't say it like,

40:16.156 --> 40:18.990
"Oh, I wonder
what you're doing over there."

40:19.066 --> 40:20.241
Mr. Poppins.

40:20.252 --> 40:21.751
- Did I say it like that?
- No.

40:21.828 --> 40:23.661
- Who's Mr. Poppins?
- I don't know.

40:23.738 --> 40:26.664
- Who is Mr. Poppins?
- I don't know. He's somebody.

40:26.741 --> 40:29.426
He's somebody that has glasses.
That's all I know.

40:29.502 --> 40:31.669
- All right?
<i> - Who the hell is Mr. Poppins?</i>

40:31.746 --> 40:34.380
Did Mary Poppins
have a man and I don't?

40:34.457 --> 40:36.424
[laughs] Now that's messed up.

40:36.435 --> 40:38.101
- Guys--
- I didn't say it

40:38.178 --> 40:40.178
in a creepy way like,
"Oh, what are you doing?"

40:40.254 --> 40:41.829
I didn't say it like that.

40:41.831 --> 40:45.057
I probably was like, "I am just
gonna back out of the door."

40:45.134 --> 40:46.350
- I'm just telling you guys
what happened.

40:46.427 --> 40:47.685
- She would never come
into your room

40:47.762 --> 40:49.187
and do anything
that was--like it's not.

40:49.263 --> 40:50.605
- You need to shut it down.

40:50.615 --> 40:51.689
- I don't even know
you that much.

40:51.766 --> 40:52.773
- I'm gonna be clear
about this.

40:52.784 --> 40:54.442
- You need to shut it down.

40:54.453 --> 40:56.110
- I do not believe that she
came in to do anything there.

40:56.121 --> 40:57.454
- Exactly.
That's what I'm saying.

40:57.530 --> 40:59.780
- And I've said
that to everyone.

40:59.791 --> 41:01.291
- Say it again.
- Right?

41:01.367 --> 41:05.203
- No, the conversation
was a little bit different.

41:05.279 --> 41:06.629
<i> Crystal's story's changed.</i>

41:06.706 --> 41:10.800
When she first told me
the story, it really was like

41:10.877 --> 41:13.461
Sutton set out to hurt or harm

41:13.472 --> 41:15.213
or make Crystal
feel uncomfortable.

41:15.289 --> 41:18.049
- I was, like, butt naked,
and then she continued in.

41:18.125 --> 41:19.592
And she's like, "Oh, what
are you doing over there?"

41:19.669 --> 41:21.093
And I'm like--so
I told her--I'm like,

41:21.170 --> 41:22.220
it was really creepy,

41:22.296 --> 41:23.721
and I felt like
I had no boundaries.

41:23.798 --> 41:26.557
Like, when you ----in' stand
over there and say,

41:26.634 --> 41:28.100
"What are you doing?"
----ing changing,

41:28.177 --> 41:30.570
and I'm naked,
it's creepy.

41:32.807 --> 41:35.608
- Now Crystal's saying that
she doesn't think

41:35.685 --> 41:39.496
Sutton had any bad intentions.
It's a different story.

41:39.572 --> 41:41.822
Girls, just listen,
you were moving.

41:41.833 --> 41:43.166
Everybody's under
a lot of pressure. Okay?

41:43.243 --> 41:44.450
- Yeah.
- Amen.

41:44.527 --> 41:45.668
- Amen.

41:45.745 --> 41:48.663
- And you are away
for the first time in seven,

41:48.673 --> 41:50.748
eight months from your children
and your husband.

41:50.825 --> 41:52.667
You had a lot going on.

41:52.677 --> 41:55.670
I mean, I know the night
before the trip, I called Kyle

41:55.680 --> 41:57.672
and I'm like, "What have
I gotten myself into?"

41:57.682 --> 42:02.134
Like, as excited as I was
to go, I was scared too.

42:02.211 --> 42:04.762
But I also have
my sister there. Okay?

42:04.839 --> 42:08.182
I have Lisa there.
I've met Erika several times.

42:08.193 --> 42:09.526
And my buddy over here...

42:09.602 --> 42:12.103
- Thank you.
- My English girl. And--

42:12.179 --> 42:13.354
- I'm not English.
- Hi. Hello.

42:13.365 --> 42:14.697
- I'm from Connecticut,
goddammit.

42:14.774 --> 42:17.275
- And, Dorit,
the British girl, yes, yes.

42:17.351 --> 42:20.203
- I'm not English.
My husband is English.

42:20.280 --> 42:22.196
- She's from Connecticut, babe.
- Whatever.

42:22.207 --> 42:24.115
- Sutton, I know a lot of
people

42:24.191 --> 42:26.200
that love and adore you.

42:26.211 --> 42:28.661
And I've never heard
anything shady about you.

42:28.738 --> 42:30.454
- Yeah, no.
I mean, because I'm normal.

42:30.531 --> 42:34.166
- So it's telephone.
- It's a very dangerous game...

42:34.243 --> 42:35.459
- It is.

42:35.536 --> 42:37.295
- When it's about
somebody's character.

42:37.371 --> 42:39.297
- Totally. <i> Words can get</i>
<i> somebody really in trouble,</i>

42:39.373 --> 42:41.674
<i> and especially nowadays</i>
<i> with cancel culture</i>

42:41.751 --> 42:43.467
and all that stuff,

42:43.544 --> 42:45.886
this is not the time to be
throwing around strong words.

42:45.897 --> 42:48.723
<i> I think Sutton has</i>
<i> every right to be upset.</i>

42:48.733 --> 42:52.184
- I know that I'm a little off.
But--

42:52.261 --> 42:53.853
- Why do you say that?
Why do say you're off?

42:53.929 --> 42:55.238
- Well, I have
a gigantic bow on.

42:55.315 --> 42:56.522
- Well...

42:56.599 --> 42:58.057
- It's okay.
- I love it.

42:58.134 --> 43:00.359
- But it's gonna take me
a minute to get over being told

43:00.436 --> 43:02.903
that I've violated someone.
That's a really strong word.

43:02.914 --> 43:04.655
- Okay.

43:04.732 --> 43:06.657
- It's always gonna be
rattling around in my brain.

43:06.734 --> 43:08.585
So you've got to stop saying
that I violated you 'cause I--

43:08.661 --> 43:10.536
- I'm not gonna back down
on that word.

43:10.613 --> 43:15.416
Sorry. There's nothing else
to say about it. It's done.

43:15.427 --> 43:18.344
- I gotta straighten my bowtie
for that because--no.

43:22.792 --> 43:26.177
<i> - Next time on...</i>

43:26.253 --> 43:27.345
- Can we play a set?

43:27.421 --> 43:28.679
You're gonna be great.
I have a feeling.

43:28.756 --> 43:32.266
- Oh, I'm sorry.

43:32.277 --> 43:34.226
- Oh, you have to get on
in half a minute.

43:34.303 --> 43:36.520
- Okay, I'll be over here
having my wine.

43:36.597 --> 43:38.606
- Hopefully not being too loud.

43:38.617 --> 43:39.940
[cutlery rattling]
[clanging]

43:39.951 --> 43:41.859
- [indistinct].

43:41.936 --> 43:43.694
- It looks so cute, Harry.

43:43.771 --> 43:46.530
It's cozy [indistinct]
in Beverly Hills.

43:46.607 --> 43:48.366
- It's got to be eaten
while it's hot.

43:48.442 --> 43:49.575
- Make a wish.

43:49.652 --> 43:50.960
- I want him hung like a horse.
- Aah!

43:51.037 --> 43:53.755
- Why don't you tell me
the truth?

43:55.634 --> 43:57.342
- Amelia will go to Cabo.

43:59.804 --> 44:01.212
- No, it's not appropriate.

44:01.288 --> 44:02.713
- Why are you so defensive?

44:02.790 --> 44:04.882
- You're upset because
you're jealous.

44:04.959 --> 44:09.220
- Jealous of what?
Your ugly leather pants?

44:09.296 --> 44:10.647
- No, no, no!
- No!
