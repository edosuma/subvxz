WEBVTT

00:10.510 --> 00:12.555
It's basically a love triangle
between a guy,

00:12.638 --> 00:14.347
his boyfriend in a coma
and a girl he meets online.

00:14.431 --> 00:16.559
She's codirecting a play.

00:16.642 --> 00:18.561
Unless I die in this machine.

00:18.644 --> 00:20.854
Then Jonah can direct by himself.

00:23.857 --> 00:27.653
Well, the scan shows
no new lesions or infections,

00:27.736 --> 00:30.989
but your pulmonary function tests
have declined.

00:31.073 --> 00:34.367
I think it's time to consider
the waiting list for a lung transplant.

00:37.871 --> 00:39.540
Is that really the best option?

00:39.623 --> 00:42.876
Half the CF patients who receive
new lungs live past ten years.

00:42.960 --> 00:45.087
If I survive the operation...

00:45.170 --> 00:46.379
Grace, please.

00:46.463 --> 00:47.840
Most transplants are successful.

00:47.923 --> 00:50.467
The danger is in your body
rejecting the new organs.

00:50.550 --> 00:52.010
This makes no sense!

00:52.094 --> 00:53.596
I don't feel any more sick than normal.

00:53.679 --> 00:54.680
Well, the fact is,

00:54.763 --> 00:57.307
you've grown quite accustomed
to being very, very sick.

01:00.518 --> 01:01.645
What if I say no?

01:01.729 --> 01:05.065
Without a transplant,
I believe you'll live another three years,

01:05.148 --> 01:07.317
but they'll become
increasingly more difficult

01:07.400 --> 01:09.987
as your lung function
continues to decline.

01:10.070 --> 01:12.155
So, my choices are
three crappy years

01:12.239 --> 01:14.074
or a 50-50 shot at ten?

01:14.157 --> 01:15.618
Why not toss in an electric chair?

01:15.701 --> 01:17.620
-Save ourselves the trouble?
-Grace.

01:17.703 --> 01:20.497
It's a big decision
that comes with big risks.

01:20.581 --> 01:21.707
You have a lot to talk about.

01:22.875 --> 01:24.251
Do you wanna ask
any questions?

01:24.334 --> 01:26.128
No, I just... I just wanna go.

01:30.465 --> 01:35.638
♪ Whatever it takes
I know I can make it through ♪

01:36.554 --> 01:41.226
♪ And if I hold out
I know I can make it through ♪

01:45.438 --> 01:50.861
♪ Be the best, be the best
The best that I can be ♪

01:50.944 --> 01:53.113
♪ Whatever it takes ♪

01:53.196 --> 01:58.410
♪ I know I can make it
I know I can make it through ♪

02:03.290 --> 02:04.499
This edit turned out pretty well.

02:06.168 --> 02:07.544
Something wrong?

02:07.628 --> 02:11.131
Um, yeah, just normal stress eating.

02:11.840 --> 02:14.342
Hey, you and Yael have been together
for a while, right?

02:14.426 --> 02:15.678
Sure.

02:15.761 --> 02:20.182
Have you ever wondered what you would do
if you guys, like, got pregnant?

02:21.808 --> 02:22.809
Would your parents be so mad?

02:23.393 --> 02:24.936
I don't know. Probably.

02:25.437 --> 02:27.314
Hey, did you know
you have to wait a bunch of weeks

02:27.397 --> 02:29.692
before a pregnancy test can detect
whether or not you're pregnant?

02:30.734 --> 02:33.611
-Huh?
-Oh, I'm doing research for a friend.

02:34.529 --> 02:36.531
Uh, not Frankie or Shay.

02:38.408 --> 02:39.702
It's done.

02:39.785 --> 02:41.787
-Let's post it.
-Oh, wait!

02:41.870 --> 02:44.414
You don't think I look bloated
in these shots, do you?

02:44.497 --> 02:46.541
They... look fine to me.

02:46.624 --> 02:48.668
The shots. Shots.

02:48.752 --> 02:50.963
No, uh...
There's a better shot.

02:51.046 --> 02:53.423
Um, well, there.
Oh, I'm so sorry. My bad.

02:53.506 --> 02:55.175
Oh, it's... it's okay, actually.
I've got it.

02:55.258 --> 02:58.804
Um, I'm actually, probably,
just gonna, uh, do this by myself.

02:58.887 --> 03:00.263
Well, I don't mind lending a hand.

03:00.347 --> 03:03.600
Plus, I've gotten really good at editing.
Check out this shortcut.

03:03.683 --> 03:05.435
Control...

03:06.186 --> 03:07.354
Oh, my gosh!
Uh, what is that?

03:07.437 --> 03:09.022
Why is that? Oh!

03:09.106 --> 03:11.316
I don't... I don't know.
I'm sorry, uh--

03:11.399 --> 03:13.026
Hey, um, it's okay.
Okay, I...

03:13.110 --> 03:14.695
This never happened.
I won't say anything, okay?

03:23.996 --> 03:25.288
Good morning, Madame President.

03:25.372 --> 03:27.457
Hey, you.
Ready for tonight?

03:27.540 --> 03:31.419
For our big first date?
Oh, yes.

03:31.503 --> 03:34.672
As for our date plans...

03:35.632 --> 03:37.384
--Shut up!

03:37.467 --> 03:39.177
A sing-along screening
of High School Musical?

03:39.261 --> 03:40.470
This is already so perfect!

03:40.553 --> 03:42.931
And you haven't even heard me sing yet.

03:46.769 --> 03:49.062
I'll, uh, see you in Computer Science.

03:49.146 --> 03:50.814
- Can't wait.

03:54.692 --> 03:56.319
Hey, what was all the excitement in there?

03:56.403 --> 03:59.031
Zoë got tickets to a sing-along
High School Musical screening tonight.

03:59.114 --> 04:00.407
Oh, fun!

04:03.034 --> 04:04.161
They still have tickets!

04:05.412 --> 04:06.955
--Done!

04:07.039 --> 04:09.624
I know we said we'd watch it together,
but this is way better!

04:09.707 --> 04:11.668
Yes, that is a thing we said.

04:12.878 --> 04:15.547
-See you after class. Go Wildcats!
-Whoo!

04:17.800 --> 04:21.303
Let me guess. That was supposed to be
a Zoë night, not a Goldi hang?

04:21.386 --> 04:22.846
Yeah.

04:22.930 --> 04:26.308
But to explain that to Goldi,
I'd have to come out to Goldi.

04:26.391 --> 04:28.726
And... I'm not ready to do that.

04:29.436 --> 04:30.854
So now I ruined my date with Zoë.

04:30.938 --> 04:33.315
-She's gonna be so mad.
-Dude, it's okay.

04:34.357 --> 04:38.195
Uh, Zoë might seem intimidating,
but she's actually pretty understanding.

05:21.696 --> 05:24.616
So, obviously Obi-Wan
killed Luke's aunt and uncle

05:24.699 --> 05:26.659
because it was the only way
to get him to join the Rebellion.

05:26.743 --> 05:28.537
-Uh, did you get it up?
-Oh.

05:30.038 --> 05:32.457
- Uh, the vlog. Did you post it?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

05:32.540 --> 05:34.292
Oh, yeah, that. Um, yeah, yeah.
It's, um, it's all posted.

05:34.376 --> 05:35.126
Okay.

05:38.881 --> 05:40.090
We have to fire Lola.

05:41.049 --> 05:43.718
We have an arrangement
where I speak to her on a biweekly basis.

05:43.801 --> 05:45.971
You wanna just throw that all away?

05:46.054 --> 05:47.555
Swear you'll take this
to your grave?

05:47.639 --> 05:48.765
Yeah, sure.

05:48.848 --> 05:52.560
When we were editing,
she kinda brushed my...

05:53.728 --> 05:54.854
And you know with the...

05:54.938 --> 05:56.231
The Force awakened?

05:56.314 --> 05:58.942
What if Yael finds out?

05:59.026 --> 06:02.737
Not-So-Little-Baaz stands up
on the bus sometimes. It happens.

06:02.820 --> 06:03.989
Yael's already iffy about her.

06:04.072 --> 06:06.824
I mean, what if she tells her?
I can't get dumped over this.

06:08.660 --> 06:11.121
If we had to, we could just vote Lola out.

06:11.204 --> 06:14.249
Uh, we already have two votes.
And Vijay's a guy. He'll agree with us.

06:14.332 --> 06:16.209
That makes three votes to Yael's one.

06:16.293 --> 06:17.710
If we had to.

06:17.794 --> 06:20.213
If we're suddenly all anti-Lola,
Yael's gonna notice.

06:20.297 --> 06:23.883
And there's no way
she'd believe I want Lola gone.

06:23.967 --> 06:25.885
It has to be Yael's idea.

06:27.012 --> 06:28.638
Normally,
I'd just call you an idiot,

06:28.721 --> 06:30.307
but Tristan gave me
a thumbs up this morning,

06:30.390 --> 06:31.766
-so I'm in a good mood.
-Oh, I'm happy for you.

06:31.849 --> 06:33.601
Grace, can you please
tell your codirector here

06:33.685 --> 06:35.020
that projecting sepia tone

06:35.103 --> 06:36.646
is just gonna make
everything else look brown.

06:36.729 --> 06:39.024
- Not brown. Golden.

06:39.107 --> 06:40.943
It's supposed to give coma boy's speeches
an ethereal feel.

06:41.026 --> 06:43.236
Who the hell cares
if the lights are white or brown,

06:43.320 --> 06:45.155
or if we do the whole damn thing
in the dark?

06:46.073 --> 06:47.782
Great. Rehearsal canceled.
Got it.

06:49.242 --> 06:51.536
-Grace...
-I'm fine.

06:51.619 --> 06:53.455
Yeah, you seem the most fine.

06:57.292 --> 06:59.086
You know my sucky lungs?

07:00.170 --> 07:02.005
They got even suckier.

07:05.633 --> 07:08.011
The doctor gave me three years
if I don't get a transplant.

07:08.886 --> 07:10.138
Well, you're getting it, right?

07:10.222 --> 07:13.100
So I can trade them for ten years
of antirejection meds?

07:13.183 --> 07:14.226
Sign me up.

07:14.977 --> 07:17.520
-With ten years you, you could--
-Pick out a really nice casket?

07:17.604 --> 07:20.023
- That's not funny.
- It's kinda funny.

07:20.107 --> 07:23.151
So, what should I do?

07:23.235 --> 07:24.486
Rehearsal? School?

07:25.278 --> 07:27.489
Those hardly seem important
when you're gonna die.

07:29.157 --> 07:30.200
Okay...

07:33.286 --> 07:34.621
We're taking the afternoon off.

07:37.665 --> 07:40.377
And next week, I'm thinking
of reviewing the new Black Panther.

07:40.460 --> 07:41.878
Nice. Is that it?

07:41.962 --> 07:43.380
I gotta proof an essay before class.

07:43.463 --> 07:45.673
Actually, uh, Baaz,
you had some new business?

07:46.466 --> 07:49.011
Uh, yeah, um...

07:49.094 --> 07:50.428
We're hemorrhaging money.

07:51.929 --> 07:55.058
Uh, I thought our view counts were
generating a small profit.

07:55.142 --> 07:57.269
Uh, well, look at the numbers yourself.

08:06.069 --> 08:08.279
Well, um, maybe it's an expense problem.

08:09.781 --> 08:12.075
Just off...
Just off the top of my head.

08:13.035 --> 08:15.203
Are Lola's vlogs really costing
that much to make?

08:15.912 --> 08:20.583
Makeup is more expensive
than movie tickets and game subscriptions,

08:20.667 --> 08:23.586
but shouldn't her views make up for that?

08:23.670 --> 08:27.007
Well, I mean, according to this,
she's still lagging behind the rest of us.

08:28.633 --> 08:31.094
Weird.
So, what should we do?

08:32.554 --> 08:34.806
-I think we have to let her go.
-Well, let's not be hasty.

08:34.889 --> 08:37.142
What if she has
huge future upside potential?

08:37.642 --> 08:40.145
The data just doesn't support that.

08:41.563 --> 08:43.231
All those in favor of firing Lola?

08:46.318 --> 08:47.985
I'll draft the e-mail.

08:48.695 --> 08:50.572
-Walk me to class?
-Yeah.

09:02.125 --> 09:03.418
Hey, I saw Tristan at lunch.

09:03.501 --> 09:05.420
Goldi invited herself to the movie!

09:06.338 --> 09:09.132
I accidentally invited her,
and she bought a ticket,

09:09.216 --> 09:11.801
and I couldn't tell her it was a date,
and I'm so, so sorry.

09:11.884 --> 09:13.345
Hey, it's okay.

09:13.428 --> 09:14.887
I was looking forward
to our first date so much,

09:14.971 --> 09:15.972
and now I ruined it.

09:16.056 --> 09:18.850
Well, maybe you could actually tell her
it's a date?

09:21.144 --> 09:23.480
-I don't think so.
-She's cool with me being gay.

09:23.563 --> 09:26.774
-And same thing with Tristan last year.
-You're not living with her.

09:26.858 --> 09:29.069
Plus, her family has been so generous.

09:29.152 --> 09:31.571
And I can't risk losing my best friend
and messing everything up.

09:31.654 --> 09:33.406
I get it.

09:33.490 --> 09:35.658
I'm so glad you understand.

09:36.909 --> 09:38.620
We'll find another time to go on a date.

09:39.662 --> 09:42.249
Oh, no, no.
We're still going on a date tonight.

09:43.291 --> 09:46.836
We just need to figure out a way
to keep Goldi occupied.

09:46.919 --> 09:48.838
-We just need a--
-Scheme?

09:48.921 --> 09:51.341
Schemes are my favorite.

09:54.177 --> 09:56.429
Here we are.
Seizing the day.

09:56.513 --> 09:58.055
Hey, this is a fun course.

09:58.140 --> 09:59.974
Plus, no one's around, so we can talk.

10:00.057 --> 10:01.476
Good luck with that.

10:01.559 --> 10:04.187
This isn't my first "Let's inspire Grace
to choose life" pep talk.

10:05.147 --> 10:09.025
Yeah, but my pep talk has, uh, those guys.

10:10.777 --> 10:12.945
-Grace, this is a huge life decision.
-Actually, it's not.

10:13.029 --> 10:14.656
Both options end pretty much the same way.

10:17.534 --> 10:20.370
All right. Let's play for it.

10:21.371 --> 10:23.248
What?

10:23.331 --> 10:26.626
If I win, you get the transplant.
You win, you ride out the lungs.

10:26.709 --> 10:29.254
-How's that for "pep"?
-I know what you're trying to do.

10:29.337 --> 10:31.464
Prove my mini-putt dominance?

10:40.848 --> 10:43.685
- Ah! Ah!

10:44.686 --> 10:47.272
Fine, let's do it.
I'm dead either way.

10:48.105 --> 10:49.982
Might as well let a ball decide.

10:56.656 --> 10:59.242
The fashion club is
teaming up with the QSA

10:59.326 --> 11:00.827
to sell gender-neutral clothing at lunch.

11:00.910 --> 11:03.163
Come check us out in the foyer.

11:09.377 --> 11:12.172
-Goldi, I need a favor.
-Oh, no, what's wrong?

11:12.255 --> 11:14.966
I'm coming down with something
and so is Winston.

11:15.967 --> 11:17.802
Oh, no, he has that thing tonight.

11:17.885 --> 11:19.846
The council presentation
to the PTA, yeah.

11:19.929 --> 11:22.557
He can't do it, and I'm too sick to cover.

11:30.357 --> 11:33.025
I can do it,
but I'm gonna have to bail on Rasha.

11:33.109 --> 11:35.528
I'm gonna miss it, too.

11:35.612 --> 11:37.905
But, I'll owe you huge for filling in.

11:39.741 --> 11:41.618
Okay, I'll do it.

11:41.701 --> 11:43.745
Feel better. Soup.

11:55.423 --> 11:56.466
Hey, Goldi. 'Sup?

11:56.549 --> 11:59.386
Just getting my books.
I left them here earlier.

11:59.469 --> 12:00.928
Rasha, I'm really sorry,

12:01.012 --> 12:03.348
but Zoë and Winston came down
with something,

12:03.431 --> 12:05.808
and I have to fill in
at the PTA thing tonight.

12:05.892 --> 12:08.227
Oh, that's too bad.
Say no more.

12:08.811 --> 12:10.063
Thanks for understanding.

12:14.066 --> 12:15.735
- Mission accomplished.
- Hey, Rasha...

12:16.903 --> 12:18.405
Maybe if Zoë's feeling up to it,

12:18.488 --> 12:21.533
we'll do our own HSM sing-along
at home, okay?

12:23.117 --> 12:24.452
You're kinda the best.

12:38.591 --> 12:39.967
The e-mail went through to Lola?

12:40.051 --> 12:42.094
Sent it via text.
Got that "read" receipt.

12:42.178 --> 12:43.680
It's done. She's out.

12:43.763 --> 12:45.640
Now we just gotta spin this
to our subscribers,

12:45.723 --> 12:46.974
and we're home free.

12:47.058 --> 12:49.143
-I owe you one.
-How big of one?

12:49.226 --> 12:51.270
If I'm gonna call in my favor,
I need to know how much I'm owed.

12:52.146 --> 12:53.773
Hey, I just ironed this!

12:53.856 --> 12:55.733
Why is Yael talking to Lola?

12:56.568 --> 12:58.570
- Can you read lips?

12:58.653 --> 13:03.450
"I am ham... sandwich?"

13:03.533 --> 13:04.534
I cannot.

13:05.410 --> 13:07.620
Well... I'm dead.

13:08.120 --> 13:09.831
She's gonna tell her what happened.

13:09.914 --> 13:11.708
Maybe it's about
something different.

13:13.042 --> 13:14.251
Or maybe not.

13:15.378 --> 13:16.546
Yael doesn't even like Lola.

13:16.629 --> 13:19.549
-I assumed they'd never talk.
-Well, they sure are talking now.

13:19.632 --> 13:22.510
What was I supposed to do?
I couldn't let Yael find out.

13:22.594 --> 13:25.054
And yet,
it's possible she found out anyway.

13:33.980 --> 13:36.148
You are not gonna beat me that way.

13:37.066 --> 13:39.110
All right.

13:42.905 --> 13:44.491
Oh!

13:44.574 --> 13:47.243
Couldn't stand
to be away from me for one shot.

13:47.326 --> 13:50.162
Don't worry.
I won't tell your girlfriend.

13:51.080 --> 13:53.375
Actually, Frankie and I are on a break.

13:55.960 --> 13:57.253
She had a bit too much trouble

13:57.336 --> 13:59.631
with how much time
I was spending on the play.

13:59.714 --> 14:01.549
You can't just drop everything for her.

14:04.594 --> 14:08.264
It's just I really like Frankie,
but I've no idea what she wants.

14:08.347 --> 14:10.266
It's like, should I be stressing
about my relationship,

14:10.349 --> 14:11.601
-or my future?
-Your future.

14:11.684 --> 14:13.770
Because you have one, unlike yours truly.

14:13.853 --> 14:16.355
The transplant gives you ten good years.

14:16.439 --> 14:17.982
10% chance I won't survive.

14:18.065 --> 14:20.151
But if you do, you'll be healthier.

14:21.027 --> 14:23.363
You could travel the world.
You could go to school,

14:23.446 --> 14:25.823
-solve some mysteries.
-Who with?

14:25.907 --> 14:27.659
Maya can't even be bothered
to pick up her phone.

14:27.742 --> 14:30.119
She's obviously going through something.

14:30.202 --> 14:31.203
It'll pass.

14:32.121 --> 14:36.626
Maybe, but... you'll take off
and Zoë will, too.

14:36.709 --> 14:38.378
And who will I even
go through all that for?

14:39.962 --> 14:42.840
For Grace?
I hear she's all right.

14:44.341 --> 14:49.138
So, I'll get to live long enough
to see my friends get jobs and families,

14:49.221 --> 14:51.891
and do all the things
I'll never get to do.

14:55.728 --> 14:58.815
This whole time I thought
it was you were afraid of dying, but...

15:00.107 --> 15:02.026
it's living, what scares you.

15:04.361 --> 15:06.823
Next, you're gonna say
that if I live another ten years,

15:06.906 --> 15:09.325
science will come up with a miracle cure.

15:09.409 --> 15:11.494
Without the transplant,
you will never find out.

15:12.036 --> 15:15.164
Look, if you sink this, you win.

15:15.247 --> 15:17.041
No transplant.
That's an easy shot.

15:17.917 --> 15:19.210
Unless I overhit it.

15:20.169 --> 15:22.547
You still gotta take
the shot though, right?

15:31.388 --> 15:33.265
-Need anything else?
-I'm good.

15:34.266 --> 15:36.561
So, I was talking to Lola today.

15:36.644 --> 15:38.146
Um, is something up?

15:38.646 --> 15:40.106
Like what?

15:40.690 --> 15:44.694
Well, Baaz had her makeup costing $200,
but she only bought, like, two things.

15:45.278 --> 15:46.904
Well, maybe it was a decimal error?

15:46.988 --> 15:48.614
Did someone want her gone?

15:51.743 --> 15:53.828
- Okay, you caught me.
- What?

15:53.911 --> 15:55.162
I got a boner for Lola.

15:55.246 --> 15:56.664
You got a what for who?

15:56.748 --> 15:58.415
- Wait, you didn't already know?

15:58.500 --> 16:00.793
What was Lola telling you in the hallway?

16:00.877 --> 16:03.379
That she wasn't finished the slides
to our history presentation.

16:05.923 --> 16:07.133
It just kind of happened.

16:07.216 --> 16:09.552
She was standing too close to me,
and it...

16:09.636 --> 16:10.970
Wow.
Okay.

16:11.053 --> 16:13.014
It was an involuntary biological reaction.

16:13.097 --> 16:14.932
It didn't mean anything.

16:15.016 --> 16:16.433
Except that it made you lie to me.

16:28.404 --> 16:30.197
I can't believe
we got away with that.

16:30.281 --> 16:31.491
You were amazing.

16:31.574 --> 16:33.743
It's not my first rodeo.

16:33.826 --> 16:35.077
Ladies, what will it be?

16:35.953 --> 16:38.623
Uh, skinny half-caff chai tea latte.

16:38.706 --> 16:40.166
Rasha?

16:41.375 --> 16:43.628
Uh, we can't let that guy see us.

16:43.711 --> 16:45.672
Can we hide here a minute, please?

16:45.755 --> 16:47.632
Schemes.
I love schemes.

16:52.762 --> 16:54.346
If Baaz sees us, he might tell Goldi.

16:54.430 --> 16:56.473
Or, worse,
he'll figure out we're on a date.

16:57.517 --> 16:59.769
He's probably just having a quick coffee.

17:00.978 --> 17:03.105
Garçon, can you tell me
your dinner specials?

17:04.816 --> 17:06.526
Okay, it's you he'd recognize.

17:06.609 --> 17:09.195
So, I'll leave first,
and then you can sneak off

17:09.278 --> 17:11.405
and meet me when you can.
Okay?

17:11.488 --> 17:12.907
- Okay.

17:14.408 --> 17:16.578
And keep the drinks coming.
Once my team gets here,

17:16.661 --> 17:19.121
this Magic Madness marathon
will be underway.

17:20.456 --> 17:24.043
As if I'd let you
and that stupid ball decide my fate.

17:24.126 --> 17:26.503
Hey, don't hate the miniature player,
hate the miniature game.

17:26.588 --> 17:28.339
Let me grab my bag,
and then we can...

17:28.422 --> 17:30.507
- Oh, my God. Maya! Maya! Maya!
- Maya!

17:30.592 --> 17:33.010
-Maya.
-Maya! Go get help!

17:33.094 --> 17:35.054
- Maya! Maya!

17:36.430 --> 17:37.431
What the hell?

17:37.514 --> 17:40.517
-It's okay, Grace. It's okay. I'm okay.
-It's just a photo shoot.

17:40.602 --> 17:42.812
- You bailed on me for this?
- Chill.

17:42.895 --> 17:45.272
-It's part of a series we're doing.
-I needed you.

17:45.356 --> 17:47.984
-And here you are, pretending to be dead!
-It's not like that.

17:48.067 --> 17:52.029
These photos are about confronting death,
showing that it can be beautiful.

17:52.113 --> 17:53.615
Death is not beautiful!
It's final!

17:53.698 --> 17:55.825
- Don't yell at her!

17:55.908 --> 17:57.952
Who the hell are you?

17:58.035 --> 17:59.286
- Grace, come here.
- Are you okay?

17:59.370 --> 18:01.538
- Not remotely.

18:01.623 --> 18:03.124
-What's going on here?
-Come here.

18:03.207 --> 18:04.250
--Maya?

18:04.333 --> 18:06.878
Don't worry about her.
Okay? She didn't know.

18:06.961 --> 18:08.755
--And you're not dying.

18:09.881 --> 18:11.758
Look at me.

18:11.841 --> 18:13.342
Right now, I'm barely living.

18:28.941 --> 18:31.193
- Rasha.
- Sorry I screwed up our date.

18:31.277 --> 18:33.237
Why didn't you text me?
I waited.

18:33.320 --> 18:35.031
I was embarrassed.

18:35.114 --> 18:36.908
You should probably just forget
about dating me.

18:36.991 --> 18:38.075
I'm too complicated.

18:38.951 --> 18:41.746
- Don't say that.
- Why?

18:42.747 --> 18:45.374
You can have any girl
and I'm ruining everything.

18:45.457 --> 18:46.876
But, you, you're gorgeous,
you're fearless--

18:46.959 --> 18:50.922
Rasha,
I was afraid to ask you out for weeks.

18:51.005 --> 18:52.799
Yeah, right.

18:54.175 --> 18:55.843
You escaped war.

18:57.386 --> 18:59.722
You came all the way here
to start a whole new life.

18:59.806 --> 19:01.641
You're the fearless one.

19:12.985 --> 19:15.196
I was tired of being afraid.

19:21.202 --> 19:23.329
I wanted to do that, like, all last night.

19:23.412 --> 19:25.539
Maybe we can figure this out.

19:25.622 --> 19:27.291
I'm in no rush.

19:32.004 --> 19:33.297
Zoë?

19:35.382 --> 19:36.467
Mom.

19:38.177 --> 19:39.762
You forgot your books in the car.

19:47.854 --> 19:49.772
We rehired Lola.

19:49.856 --> 19:53.192
Good, but that doesn't solve
anything between us.

19:53.275 --> 19:54.401
I know.

19:55.652 --> 19:57.196
I wanna show you what I've learned.

20:00.908 --> 20:02.076
When I do something dumb,

20:02.159 --> 20:05.496
should I... tell you the truth,

20:06.330 --> 20:08.207
or keep it a secret?

20:09.834 --> 20:12.253
Tell you.
I get that now.

20:15.006 --> 20:16.090
Still yes.

20:22.221 --> 20:23.931
I don't wanna be an idiot anymore.

20:24.015 --> 20:26.392
I'm not jealous of Lola, okay?

20:26.475 --> 20:28.853
I know you have better taste than that.

20:28.936 --> 20:31.147
But you and I were best friends.

20:31.230 --> 20:33.065
We... we used to
tell each other everything.

20:34.358 --> 20:36.152
So, I should tell you when I get a...

20:37.069 --> 20:39.238
You know?
For another girl?

20:39.321 --> 20:41.949
You and the guys and I used to joke
about boners all the time.

20:42.033 --> 20:43.200
I mean, they're objectively funny.

20:43.284 --> 20:46.913
Yeah.
Well, this one was embarrassing.

20:46.996 --> 20:48.998
So, share that with me, too.

20:49.081 --> 20:51.500
I mean, you told Baaz, for God's sake!

20:51.583 --> 20:54.420
Don't shut me out
just because we're dating.

20:59.383 --> 21:01.177
If I promise to keep you in the loop...

21:02.178 --> 21:03.220
are we cool?

21:04.388 --> 21:07.058
Maybe.
I... I don't know yet.

21:08.350 --> 21:14.148
Let's just agree for now
that boners are funny.

21:15.524 --> 21:16.650
Okay.

21:25.659 --> 21:26.953
--Okay.

21:27.036 --> 21:29.163
So, what we'll do is blast light
into the audience's eyes,

21:29.246 --> 21:30.581
like the light at the end of the tunnel.

21:30.664 --> 21:31.999
Are you trying to blind everyone?

21:32.083 --> 21:33.625
--I told you it's a bad idea.

21:33.709 --> 21:34.794
Sepia's worse.

21:34.877 --> 21:36.337
So, here's what we do.

21:36.420 --> 21:39.506
We light coma boy from below,
creating a campfire-flashlight look.

21:41.884 --> 21:44.261
Okay. So, he...
He's, like, telling a scary story?

21:44.345 --> 21:45.387
No, no.

21:46.388 --> 21:47.723
He is the scary story.

21:49.225 --> 21:50.810
What would we do without you?

21:50.893 --> 21:52.144
Fail hilariously?

21:52.228 --> 21:55.857
Okay, well, I'm gonna get some gels.
Test that out.

21:57.524 --> 21:59.526
That was a really good idea.

21:59.610 --> 22:01.695
- Whatever.

22:01.778 --> 22:03.780
Hey, we should go golfing again sometime.

22:03.865 --> 22:07.118
Yeah, for sure.
Gotta get my Grace time in while I can.

22:08.077 --> 22:10.204
Actually, that clock might not
run out so soon.

22:12.706 --> 22:14.541
-You're getting the transplant?
-Putting my name on the list.

22:14.625 --> 22:16.710
It might be a while before it comes up.

22:18.504 --> 22:20.006
Well, when it does, I'll be there.

22:21.048 --> 22:22.591
Shut up.

22:25.219 --> 22:28.847
Okay! I'm gonna rein him in
before he burns the gym down.
