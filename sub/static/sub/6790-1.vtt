00:40.790 --> 00:43.834
Oh my, God. Please help me!

00:50.008 --> 00:51.759
Oh, God...

02:03.248 --> 02:05.916
Jason! It's all done, Jason.

02:08.002 --> 02:11.380
You've done your job well,
and Mommy is pleased.

02:11.506 --> 02:13.173
That's a good boy.

02:14.884 --> 02:18.095
Now, come to Mommy. Come on.

02:21.266 --> 02:22.891
Come on.

02:25.228 --> 02:28.438
Mommy has a reward for you.

02:37.407 --> 02:45.289
Jason, Mother is talking to you.

02:47.625 --> 02:51.879
Come on.

02:52.755 --> 02:55.507
That's my boy. Come.

02:55.592 --> 02:57.259
Kneel down.

02:59.304 --> 03:01.638
That's a boy.

03:02.807 --> 03:04.433
Kneel down.

03:05.268 --> 03:07.144
Kneel down, Jason.

03:08.938 --> 03:11.481
That's my good boy.

03:16.487 --> 03:18.780
That's a good boy.

03:19.282 --> 03:21.617
Good, Jason.

03:35.798 --> 03:36.965
Ginny!

04:50.081 --> 04:53.667
Come on. Let's go. Ginny.

05:05.680 --> 05:07.389
Jesus.

05:08.516 --> 05:09.933
Come on.

08:24.378 --> 08:28.131
God damn it, Harold! I spent all day
yesterday washing your clothes.

08:28.257 --> 08:31.885
Look what you're doing to them!
You know I work very hard around here

08:31.969 --> 08:34.804
trying to keep up with you
and all your sloppy habits.

08:34.931 --> 08:37.432
And I get no help from you at all.

08:40.269 --> 08:42.312
<i>- The community of Crystal Lake...</i>
- Jerk!

08:42.438 --> 08:46.024
<i>... was shocked today with reports</i>
<i>of a grisly mass murder scene.</i>

08:46.108 --> 08:49.486
<i>Eight corpses have been discovered</i>
<i>in what is already being called</i>

08:49.612 --> 08:53.281
<i>the most brutal and heinous crime</i>
<i>in local history.</i>

08:53.407 --> 08:55.534
<i>A police spokesman told Eye-On News</i>

08:55.618 --> 08:58.703
<i>that they've been combing the area</i>
<i>since just before dawn</i>

08:58.788 --> 09:02.958
<i>and are afraid that their gruesome</i>
<i>discovery is just the beginning.</i>

09:03.084 --> 09:06.586
<i>Police Chief Scott Fitzsimmons</i>
<i>had no comment about the murders</i>

09:06.671 --> 09:08.505
<i>when reached early this morning.</i>

09:08.631 --> 09:10.715
<i>Detectives at the scene,</i>
<i>however, were baffled</i>

09:10.800 --> 09:12.842
<i>by the brutality of the killings.</i>

09:12.969 --> 09:14.719
<i>Bodies were found literally strewn</i>

09:14.804 --> 09:16.638
<i>over the four-square-mile campground</i>

09:16.764 --> 09:18.598
<i>in the remote lake region.</i>

09:18.683 --> 09:20.976
<i>Ginny Field miraculously survived</i>

09:21.102 --> 09:23.728
<i>repeated attacks</i>
<i>by the axe-wielding killer</i>

09:23.813 --> 09:26.064
<i>and was taken to a local hospital today.</i>

09:26.148 --> 09:27.524
<i>- She is in serious condition...</i>
- Oh, my God.

09:27.650 --> 09:31.611
<i>... suffering from multiple stab wounds</i>
<i>and severe hysterical shock.</i>

09:31.696 --> 09:34.197
<i>The names of the eight victims</i>
<i>are being withheld</i>

09:34.323 --> 09:37.450
<i>until notification of next of kin.</i>

09:37.535 --> 09:39.703
<i>Reports of cannibalism</i>
<i>and sexual mutilations</i>

09:39.829 --> 09:42.330
<i>- are still unconfirmed at this hour.</i>
- What are you doing out there?

09:42.456 --> 09:45.959
<i>The person responsible for the</i>
<i>Crystal Lake horror remains at large.</i>

09:52.216 --> 09:53.883
Harold, I swear...

10:06.897 --> 10:09.566
Jesus Christ, Harold.

10:09.692 --> 10:12.694
Just take what's yours
and leave the rest for me to do.

10:12.820 --> 10:15.030
Very considerate.

10:17.074 --> 10:19.534
Could've at least finished the job.

10:19.660 --> 10:22.245
Do I have to do everything around here?

10:24.415 --> 10:25.874
Harold?

10:54.070 --> 10:56.446
Okay, boys, soup's on.

11:00.576 --> 11:04.621
What's the matter, Lionel?
Aren't you hungry? Come on, it's good.

11:05.247 --> 11:07.707
Here, look. I'm eating.

11:10.252 --> 11:11.920
It is good.

11:23.099 --> 11:24.891
Dayfly eggs?

11:26.602 --> 11:29.312
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

11:30.481 --> 11:34.693
Come on. If Edna catches you in here,
she'll make a fur coat out of you.

11:34.777 --> 11:36.986
Come on, I'll take you home.

12:20.322 --> 12:22.782
Didn't I feed you enough for supper?

12:22.867 --> 12:25.368
The doctor said you have to lose weight,
now didn't he?

12:25.494 --> 12:27.120
You know, I'm trying to help you,

12:27.204 --> 12:30.039
but you just keep sneaking food
behind my back.

12:30.166 --> 12:32.333
What am I gonna do with you?

12:32.460 --> 12:36.504
And would you put that filthy animal
back where it belongs? Come on.

12:54.690 --> 12:58.693
Hey, hey, hey. What are you
so nervous about? Come on.

13:11.707 --> 13:14.417
Who would do something like this?

13:21.091 --> 13:23.593
What's the matter? What happened?

13:23.719 --> 13:26.888
It's all that crap
you've been stuffing yourselfwith!

13:27.890 --> 13:31.601
<i>It's Easy Money time, the easy money</i>
<i>show where everybody wins.</i>

13:31.727 --> 13:33.436
Now, where's that other needle?

13:47.284 --> 13:49.327
<i>Thank you, Johnny, and good</i>
<i>evening, ladies and gentlemen.</i>

13:49.411 --> 13:53.665
<i>Yes, it's Easy Money, Charlie Lincoln,</i>
<i>and I'm here to give away money.</i>

13:53.749 --> 13:57.794
<i>I've got a pocketful of money</i>
<i>burning a hole in my pocket...</i>

15:27.134 --> 15:28.509
<i>Charles Dickens, ladies and gentlemen.</i>

15:28.636 --> 15:30.303
Harold?

15:30.387 --> 15:33.014
<i>Fourteen straight weeks in a row.</i>

15:33.557 --> 15:35.350
Harold?

15:39.480 --> 15:41.856
<i>That's not the end.</i>

15:59.541 --> 16:01.042
Harold?

16:48.257 --> 16:50.800
It's the white house on the left.

16:50.926 --> 16:54.637
- Shelly, come and meet your date.
- Bring her to me!

16:54.763 --> 16:57.807
Maybe this wasn't such a good idea.

16:59.768 --> 17:03.438
Sex, sex, sex. You guys
are getting boring, you know that?

17:03.564 --> 17:06.315
What would a weekend
in the country be without sex?

17:06.442 --> 17:09.359
- Cool it, Andy.
- I didn't mean it that way.

17:09.444 --> 17:12.280
Look, you guys, I want you
to have a good time this weekend.

17:12.364 --> 17:15.157
What happened to me at the lake
happened a long time ago.

17:15.284 --> 17:17.827
I'm fine, really, okay?
Just forget about me.

17:17.953 --> 17:21.079
I'm supposed to forget
that we've been friends...

17:21.165 --> 17:24.876
God damn it, Shelly! Why do you
always have to be such an asshole?

17:24.960 --> 17:28.921
I beg your pardon.
I'm not an asshole. I'm an actor.

17:29.006 --> 17:30.631
Same thing.

17:33.510 --> 17:37.680
Look, Shelly, you're my roommate,
and I like you. Most of the time.

17:37.806 --> 17:40.141
But you've gotta quit doing those things.

17:40.225 --> 17:42.852
Now, I got you a date, didn't I? Didn't I?

17:42.978 --> 17:45.354
- Yeah.
- So don't embarrass me.

17:45.481 --> 17:47.774
Just relax. Be yourself.

17:47.858 --> 17:51.319
Would you be yourself
if you looked like this?

17:57.326 --> 17:59.327
- Yes?
- Hi, Mrs Sanchez. I'm Chris.

17:59.411 --> 18:01.704
We've come to pick up Vera.

18:01.830 --> 18:03.706
She is not going!

18:07.711 --> 18:11.923
- What are they saying?
- I don't know. I flunked Spanish.

18:12.007 --> 18:14.509
Hi, everybody. What are you looking at?

18:14.593 --> 18:16.552
Is everything all right?

18:16.678 --> 18:18.971
Just your basic
old-fashioned mother problems.

18:19.056 --> 18:21.682
So which one's my date?

18:21.767 --> 18:22.850
Hi.

18:24.228 --> 18:26.187
You're Shelly?

18:26.522 --> 18:27.814
Sorry.

18:27.898 --> 18:29.941
Hey, the van's on fire!

18:55.759 --> 18:58.719
Is that all you two are gonna do
this weekend? Smoke dope?

18:58.804 --> 19:01.389
Why not, man? Is there a law against it?

19:01.473 --> 19:03.516
There are better things to do
with your life.

19:03.600 --> 19:07.103
- Like what?
- I can't think of anything.

19:07.229 --> 19:10.064
Hey, Chrissy.
How much further to the lake?

19:10.149 --> 19:12.233
We would've been there already
if some people

19:12.317 --> 19:14.485
didn't have to go to the bathroom
every five minutes.

19:14.570 --> 19:17.238
That's what happens
when you're pregnant.

19:17.322 --> 19:18.990
Sure, why not?

19:19.158 --> 19:23.578
Hey! Let's share the wealth with those
less fortunate up front here.

19:26.248 --> 19:27.415
Yeah.

19:29.585 --> 19:33.296
- What do you got in there?
- My whole world.

19:34.423 --> 19:38.759
- In that little thing?
- Stick around. You'll see.

19:41.972 --> 19:43.598
- It's the cops.
- Oh, my God!

19:43.682 --> 19:45.892
- What?
- They're catching us.

19:45.976 --> 19:48.311
- What are we gonna do?
- Destroy the evidence! Hurry!

19:48.437 --> 19:51.355
- No way, man.
- Let's go, Chuck! Come on!

19:51.440 --> 19:53.107
- They're gaining on us.
- Throw it out!

19:53.192 --> 19:56.444
- No, they'll see it.
- We gotta get rid of it. Eat it.

19:56.528 --> 19:58.863
The cops are gonna get us.
We're going to jail!

19:58.947 --> 20:00.406
- I'm driving.
- Breakfast?

20:00.490 --> 20:02.408
No way! We're pregnant, remember?

20:02.492 --> 20:04.160
Faster! Eat faster!

20:04.286 --> 20:08.331
- Why don't you help us?
- I guess I'm just not hungry.

20:08.457 --> 20:11.209
You're always hungry, Shelly.
Come on, eat!

20:11.293 --> 20:14.003
- I'm allergic to pot.
- I gotta pull over.

20:19.968 --> 20:22.678
- Oh, man!
- Oh, no!

20:23.847 --> 20:25.014
Shit!

20:38.320 --> 20:40.655
<i>Charlie 63 is unable to handle...</i>

20:40.739 --> 20:44.116
Help out the ambulance.
I'll get the crowd.

20:44.201 --> 20:45.534
Okay, you guys, show's over.

20:45.661 --> 20:48.496
Let's move it back over here, all right?
Come on, you guys.

21:04.846 --> 21:08.516
Hey, kiddo. Don't let your imagination
run away with you.

21:20.362 --> 21:23.698
- Chris, stop the van. Stop!
- What is it?

21:26.285 --> 21:29.787
- What are you doing?
- You almost ran over him!

21:29.871 --> 21:32.331
I must have been daydreaming.
I didn't even see him.

21:32.416 --> 21:35.835
Hey, he looks just like my grandfather.

21:35.919 --> 21:37.044
Why,

21:38.297 --> 21:41.007
I must be in heaven!

21:41.091 --> 21:44.051
Don't touch him.
You don't know where he's been.

21:44.136 --> 21:47.555
- Thank you.
- Sleeping in the middle of the road?

21:47.639 --> 21:51.684
You are, indeed, all of you,
kind and generous young people.

21:51.768 --> 21:57.148
Look upon what his grace
has brought unto me!

21:57.232 --> 21:59.984
- What is that?
- I found this today.

22:00.068 --> 22:03.070
- There were other parts of the body.
- That's an eyeball!

22:03.155 --> 22:07.575
And he said that he wanted me
to have this. This.

22:07.659 --> 22:11.954
He wanted me to warn you!
Look upon this omen

22:12.080 --> 22:15.666
and go back from whence ye came!

22:15.751 --> 22:19.086
I have warned thee!

22:19.504 --> 22:22.798
I have warned thee.

22:30.599 --> 22:32.433
Check it out!

23:04.633 --> 23:07.468
Why don't we take our bags
into the house first.

23:07.552 --> 23:09.220
Chris, come on down.

23:09.304 --> 23:13.808
You go ahead. I'm gonna take my bags
in the house first and look around.

23:24.319 --> 23:26.153
Don't you dare! I'm not ready!

23:36.998 --> 23:38.499
Hello?

23:43.672 --> 23:45.423
Is someone here?

23:52.013 --> 23:53.806
Rick!

23:53.890 --> 23:57.351
Is it my imagination
or did it just get cold in here?

24:00.105 --> 24:03.441
Did I do something wrong? Did I?

24:04.526 --> 24:08.112
No. It's just being here again.

24:08.780 --> 24:13.701
I know it's only been two years,
but I feel like I've been away forever.

24:13.785 --> 24:16.745
Doesn't look like
anything's changed, though.

24:17.581 --> 24:19.707
Even the paintings are still crooked.

24:19.791 --> 24:24.044
Well, you've certainly changed.
Don't you even say hello any more?

24:24.129 --> 24:25.546
I'm sorry.

24:27.883 --> 24:31.010
- Hello, Rick. How are you?
- Well, that's a start.

24:31.094 --> 24:33.637
Could you just slow down, please?

24:33.722 --> 24:36.432
There's a whole weekend ahead of us.
Let me get to know you again.

24:36.558 --> 24:38.392
Let me get to know this place again.

24:38.477 --> 24:41.979
Okay. But there's only
so many cold showers I can take.

24:43.732 --> 24:46.484
Come outside
and help me with the bags.

24:49.738 --> 24:51.572
Oh, God!

24:51.656 --> 24:55.409
You know, Chris, I think you've gained
some weight since last summer.

24:55.494 --> 24:59.246
I have not! You creep. Put me down.

24:59.331 --> 25:03.334
Here, you get the ones inside.
I'll get the ones off the top.

25:05.921 --> 25:07.963
Wasn't this door closed
a few minutes ago?

25:08.089 --> 25:11.091
- What did you say?
- Nothing.

25:18.433 --> 25:19.683
Chris...

25:20.936 --> 25:22.895
That's my bag. I'll take care of it.

25:22.979 --> 25:24.730
Shelly, what are you doing in there?

25:24.814 --> 25:26.899
Why aren't you down at the lake
with everybody else?

25:26.983 --> 25:30.569
They said
they were going skinny-dipping.

25:30.654 --> 25:32.780
And I'm not skinny enough.

25:35.492 --> 25:38.494
This was my bedroom.
It's yours for the weekend.

25:38.620 --> 25:40.204
Great.

25:49.631 --> 25:54.301
Chris? I don't mean to be picky
or anything, but where's the bed?

25:56.471 --> 25:57.805
Chris?

26:02.352 --> 26:04.144
It's right here.

26:06.314 --> 26:09.066
- What's this?
- It's your bed.

26:09.150 --> 26:12.486
- A hammock?
- You might like it.

26:14.698 --> 26:16.490
Why not?

26:25.500 --> 26:27.167
Where's the bed?

26:29.004 --> 26:30.462
All right.

26:30.547 --> 26:35.009
Chris, I don't understand
why you guys have so much hay.

26:35.093 --> 26:37.052
You don't even have any horses.
You never did.

26:37.178 --> 26:41.348
It's my father's idea. Every year,
he makes plans to buy a horse

26:41.433 --> 26:46.312
and every year, he buys all this hay
but no horse. You figure it out.

26:46.396 --> 26:50.983
You realise, of course,
that I gave up an opportunity

26:51.067 --> 26:54.194
to spend the weekend
with Mary Jo Conrad for this.

26:54.279 --> 26:56.530
You mean you actually
gave up the chance

26:56.615 --> 27:00.492
to be with the Mary Jo Conrad
for little old me?

27:00.577 --> 27:02.494
That's right.

27:02.579 --> 27:04.288
Boy, are you dumb.

27:05.749 --> 27:08.626
Okay, Chris, I realise
I'm just a dumb country boy

27:08.710 --> 27:11.170
and my feelings really don't matter.

27:11.254 --> 27:15.257
But this is the sweat of a worker
on my forehead, not of a lover.

27:15.383 --> 27:17.384
Now, I believe

27:19.220 --> 27:23.557
that there is a time
and a place for everything.

27:25.268 --> 27:29.229
And now's the time and now's the place,
if you know what I mean.

27:29.314 --> 27:31.523
So, what I think we should do

27:31.608 --> 27:34.902
is set aside three hours a day
to fulfil our needs.

27:34.986 --> 27:38.280
One in the morning and two at night.

27:40.116 --> 27:42.368
If you agree, I agree.

27:42.452 --> 27:44.745
Were you talking to me?

27:57.509 --> 27:59.927
- Is anyone in here?
- What's going on?

28:00.011 --> 28:03.347
You check down here.
I'll check the upstairs.

28:25.286 --> 28:27.037
Is anybody in there?

29:05.827 --> 29:08.495
Don't look at him.
Let's just get the hell out of here.

29:08.580 --> 29:10.873
- We heard screaming.
- Oh, my God!

29:10.999 --> 29:12.541
- What happened to him?
- Is he dead?

29:12.667 --> 29:15.335
- Don't touch him, Andy!
- Don't move him!

29:15.420 --> 29:17.546
You creep! Get up!

29:19.007 --> 29:20.841
I guess I fooled you?

29:20.925 --> 29:22.551
- You jerk!
- Chris, leave him alone.

29:22.677 --> 29:25.596
- He doesn't know any better.
- It was a joke!

29:26.014 --> 29:28.182
- Chris.
- It was just a joke.

29:29.100 --> 29:33.145
- I didn't mean to...
- You never mean to.

29:33.229 --> 29:35.606
I gotta get out of here.
I'm going to the store.

29:35.690 --> 29:37.900
- Can I use your car?
- Oh, sure.

29:38.526 --> 29:39.777
Thanks.

29:40.695 --> 29:41.945
Asshole!

29:52.207 --> 29:54.833
Hey, hey, hey. Hey, let me go with you!

29:54.918 --> 29:57.377
I gotta get out of here too.

30:16.898 --> 30:19.733
Chris. Chris, wait up.

30:19.818 --> 30:21.109
What's wrong?

30:21.236 --> 30:24.863
It's that creep, Shelly.
What a sick sense of humour.

30:24.948 --> 30:27.324
Oh, that's just his way
of getting attention.

30:27.408 --> 30:29.743
He doesn't know what happened.

30:29.828 --> 30:31.995
I know it, Deb.

30:32.080 --> 30:36.750
But from the minute we got here, I've
been seeing things and hearing things.

30:36.918 --> 30:40.128
It's probably just my imagination.

30:40.255 --> 30:42.130
I shouldn't have
come back here so soon.

30:42.257 --> 30:46.802
Don't let it get to you.
Relax. Enjoy the weekend.

30:46.928 --> 30:49.763
Nothing's gonna happen to you
when we're all here together.

30:49.848 --> 30:51.431
Okay.

30:51.766 --> 30:55.018
- Hey. How are things with Rick going?
- Okay.

30:56.771 --> 30:58.605
But he just doesn't understand.

31:00.358 --> 31:02.776
That'll be $18.50.

31:03.278 --> 31:06.196
We don't accept no food stamps.

31:07.448 --> 31:08.949
Shelly!

31:10.785 --> 31:12.619
I need some money.

31:21.629 --> 31:25.132
Excuse me,
but I believe that's my wallet.

31:29.304 --> 31:31.096
Make a wish.

31:31.180 --> 31:34.016
Can I buy you two guys a beer
or something?

31:37.979 --> 31:39.521
I'll take that now.

31:39.647 --> 31:42.024
Is this your rubber?

31:42.150 --> 31:44.484
Didn't your mama teach you manners?

31:44.569 --> 31:47.154
If you want something, you ask.

31:47.822 --> 31:50.657
- Nice.
- Please, be cool.

31:52.869 --> 31:55.162
May I please have the wallet?

31:55.246 --> 32:00.083
You mean,
"May I please have the wallet, ma'am?"

32:03.671 --> 32:06.840
May I please have the wallet, ma'am?

32:07.842 --> 32:12.095
That's good. That's real nice.

32:27.403 --> 32:29.529
Hey, that was a 20!

32:30.573 --> 32:31.949
- Are they following us?
- No!

32:32.033 --> 32:34.701
- Good.
- Here. You drive.

32:34.786 --> 32:37.996
The way I feel right now,
I'd probably get us into an accident.

32:38.081 --> 32:42.542
Next time, I'll know how to handle
a situation like that.

32:42.627 --> 32:45.629
Let's just hope next time isn't too soon.

33:12.240 --> 33:13.407
Oh, shit!

33:13.491 --> 33:16.410
"Oh, shit" is right. Let's get out of here.

33:19.080 --> 33:20.580
Hold on!

33:51.612 --> 33:54.698
- What are you doing?
- He went too far this time.

34:01.289 --> 34:02.539
Oh, shit!

34:07.795 --> 34:11.130
- I did it. I did it. I did it! Did I do it?
- Yes, you did it.

34:11.215 --> 34:13.467
- You were great.
- I was great.

34:14.010 --> 34:17.262
You son of a bitch! You ought to
come back here, you bastard!

34:17.346 --> 34:20.556
You ain't getting away with this!
God damn it! I'm gonna get you!

34:22.310 --> 34:24.018
What do you say
we go get some exercise?

34:24.145 --> 34:26.480
This is all the exercise I need.

34:30.568 --> 34:32.152
That was close.

34:34.322 --> 34:36.989
Hey, you better watch out
with that thing.

34:38.909 --> 34:43.663
Come on. I'm warning you, Andy.
I'll break your string.

35:00.181 --> 35:01.640
I wonder what happened to them.

35:01.724 --> 35:03.767
What happened
to your windshield, man?

35:03.851 --> 35:08.271
We had a slight misunderstanding
with a motorcycle gang.

35:08.356 --> 35:12.442
Yeah, but Shelly made them see the
error of their ways. Didn't you, Shell?

35:12.527 --> 35:14.194
It was nothing.

35:15.947 --> 35:19.199
My poor car. What did you do to it?

35:19.283 --> 35:23.537
Yeah, well, we're real sorry, you know?
But it wasn't our fault.

35:23.621 --> 35:26.706
A few minor repairs,
it'll be good as new.

35:27.959 --> 35:30.210
That's it. I've had it.

35:31.212 --> 35:33.672
I thought it would be a good idea
for us to spend some time together,

35:33.756 --> 35:35.966
but this is a little more
than I bargained for.

35:36.050 --> 35:37.801
Where are you going?

35:37.885 --> 35:39.469
Away from here.

35:40.930 --> 35:42.472
Stay with me.

35:44.100 --> 35:46.726
- Why should I?
- Because I want you to.

35:48.980 --> 35:51.731
You don't play fair, do you? Get in.

36:12.587 --> 36:14.963
- Hey. Let's go for a swim.
- I don't know.

36:15.089 --> 36:19.843
Come on. We'll be all alone.
We can do whatever we want.

36:19.927 --> 36:23.763
- Nobody'll see.
- Sounds disgusting. Let's go.

36:23.848 --> 36:27.309
I'll grab a couple of towels.
I'll see you down there.

37:15.316 --> 37:18.818
- Maybe we shouldn't do this, Ali.
- We gotta even the score, don't we?

37:18.903 --> 37:20.654
Nobody's gonna get hurt, okay, baby?

37:20.738 --> 37:22.572
- Right.
- Trust me.

37:25.910 --> 37:29.037
- Let me do it.
- I know what I'm doing.

39:26.155 --> 39:28.156
Oh, shit.

39:50.304 --> 39:51.805
Who's up there?

40:06.404 --> 40:10.407
Here, take this in the barn
and start pouring. And find Fox.

40:26.173 --> 40:30.343
What the hell are you doing?
Get off that thing.

40:33.180 --> 40:34.848
This feels good!

40:35.933 --> 40:38.893
Ali is gonna be pissed,
he sees you screwing around.

40:39.019 --> 40:41.688
Now, come on. We got shit to do.

40:46.527 --> 40:48.027
What the hell?

40:59.540 --> 41:01.040
Fox?

41:04.587 --> 41:06.212
Where are you?

41:12.219 --> 41:14.596
Stop screwing around.

41:16.140 --> 41:18.641
You're messing everything up!

41:25.065 --> 41:27.567
You're dead now, woman.

41:29.069 --> 41:30.236
Fox.

42:28.963 --> 42:30.630
Fox. Loco.

42:31.966 --> 42:33.675
Open the damn door.

42:36.011 --> 42:37.136
Fox.

42:57.700 --> 43:02.662
What the hell are you guys doing
up there? You hear me talking to you?

43:19.722 --> 43:21.514
Fox!

43:28.939 --> 43:32.025
When I find you, you bastard,
you're a dead man!

43:34.612 --> 43:35.778
Shit!

43:51.211 --> 43:54.130
- I don't wanna go home. This is fun.
- I know.

43:56.884 --> 44:00.178
- What are you doing?
- We haven't been in the barn...

44:00.262 --> 44:02.555
We haven't been in the barn yet.
Let's take a look.

44:02.640 --> 44:04.390
Not now. I'm cold.

44:07.061 --> 44:09.062
Come on, Debbie,
how about a little roll in the hay?

44:09.146 --> 44:12.398
Go play with yourself.
I'm going into the house.

44:19.073 --> 44:20.740
Hey, wait up!

44:30.751 --> 44:33.086
- Is that better?
- Yeah. Thanks.

44:34.254 --> 44:37.590
You know, I don't think
I could live anywhere else.

44:38.509 --> 44:40.760
The nights are always
so peaceful and quiet here.

44:40.844 --> 44:43.763
- It's deceiving.
- What do you mean?

44:43.847 --> 44:46.432
The quiet can fool you. It fooled me.

44:53.273 --> 44:55.650
Chris, why'd you come back here?

44:56.777 --> 44:58.986
To prove something to myself.

44:59.780 --> 45:02.949
To prove I'm stronger than I think I am.

45:03.033 --> 45:04.617
What about us?

45:06.286 --> 45:09.288
I'm here with you.
Can't that be enough for now?

45:09.373 --> 45:12.333
I don't know. I mean,
I don't see you for months on end.

45:12.459 --> 45:17.046
Then when I do, you put this barrier up
between us. How do I break through?

45:28.308 --> 45:31.227
- You give up?
- You out of your mind?

45:35.649 --> 45:37.817
- Do you give up?
- Never.

45:41.155 --> 45:43.156
I know how to stop this.

45:45.409 --> 45:50.037
Andy? I can think of much better things
for you to be doing with your hands.

45:52.249 --> 45:53.750
You win.

46:13.228 --> 46:16.773
I guess that leaves you and me. Sort of.

46:17.191 --> 46:18.357
Yep.

46:19.693 --> 46:22.111
You really are very good at that.

46:22.196 --> 46:23.696
It's nothing.

46:26.033 --> 46:31.037
Vera, you and I have gotten to know
each other a little today, you know?

46:31.121 --> 46:32.872
And I like you.

46:32.956 --> 46:38.419
I like you a lot. I was thinking
that maybe, you know, we could...

46:38.545 --> 46:43.299
I don't think so. Look, I'm gonna go
outside for a few minutes.

46:43.383 --> 46:46.469
And then when I get back in,
we'll talk, okay?

46:50.057 --> 46:52.099
Sure. We'll talk.

46:54.561 --> 46:55.895
Bitch.

47:58.625 --> 48:01.502
- How do we do it?
- Well, first we take our clothes off

48:01.628 --> 48:05.214
and then you get on top of me,
or I could get on top of you.

48:05.299 --> 48:09.135
I know how to do it. I mean,
how do we do it in the hammock?

48:11.471 --> 48:15.808
Well, I think you can
figure something out.

48:17.686 --> 48:19.729
I'll think of something.

48:26.528 --> 48:27.987
You're right.

48:28.697 --> 48:31.657
I should have told you everything
a long time ago, but I couldn't.

48:31.742 --> 48:33.993
Look, Chris, you don't have to
if you don't want to.

48:34.077 --> 48:38.331
I want to. I want you to know
what happened so you'll understand.

48:42.502 --> 48:46.839
Everything is so clear in my mind,
as if it were happening right now.

48:50.928 --> 48:53.346
I don't know if you remember,

48:53.430 --> 48:57.642
but when you dropped me off
that night, it was very late.

48:57.726 --> 49:01.270
I knew my parents would be waiting
for me, but I didn't care.

49:01.355 --> 49:03.356
We had such a good time.

49:04.900 --> 49:07.610
The minute I walked in the door,
my parents started yelling at me

49:07.694 --> 49:09.278
and cursing me.

49:11.198 --> 49:13.532
We had such a big fight.

49:15.202 --> 49:17.370
My mom slapped me.

49:18.705 --> 49:23.209
That was the first time my mother
had ever hit me. I couldn't believe it.

49:24.086 --> 49:26.796
I ran out the door and into the woods.

49:28.465 --> 49:32.134
I wanted to punish them.
So I decided to hide out all night.

49:32.219 --> 49:36.722
I thought I'd get them so worried
that they'd be sorry for what they did.

49:38.934 --> 49:41.727
It had been raining
and the woods were cold and wet,

49:41.812 --> 49:45.982
but I found a dry spot
under an old oak tree.

49:46.984 --> 49:48.985
I guess I fell asleep.

49:53.907 --> 49:56.575
All I can remember next

49:57.661 --> 50:01.747
is being startled out of sleep
by the sound of footsteps.

50:02.916 --> 50:07.128
I was sure it was Dad,
so I just sat up and I listened for him.

50:08.130 --> 50:10.506
But the footsteps stopped.

50:13.969 --> 50:17.013
Then there was
this cracking noise behind me.

50:19.349 --> 50:21.350
I turned around,

50:23.270 --> 50:26.856
and standing there
was this hideous-looking man.

50:28.358 --> 50:31.485
He was so grotesque,
he was almost inhuman.

50:33.113 --> 50:35.114
He had a knife.

50:35.198 --> 50:37.658
And he attacked me with it.

50:39.953 --> 50:42.830
I was so hysterical, I don't know
how I was even able to think,

50:42.956 --> 50:47.668
but I kicked the knife
out of his hands and I ran.

50:48.628 --> 50:53.966
But he ran after me and he caught me
and he pulled me down on the ground.

50:54.051 --> 50:58.721
I was kicking and screaming
and yelling, but it didn't do any good.

50:59.806 --> 51:02.308
He dragged me along the ground.

51:05.645 --> 51:07.313
I blacked out.

51:08.190 --> 51:11.817
I don't know what happened after that.
I just don't know.

51:13.361 --> 51:16.989
Chris? It's all right. You're all right.

51:26.166 --> 51:29.418
When I woke up, I was in my own bed.

51:31.046 --> 51:33.923
My parents have never said
a word about it.

51:35.342 --> 51:39.011
They act as if the whole thing
never happened, but it did.

51:40.847 --> 51:44.350
All I want is to just forget it, but I can't.

51:46.019 --> 51:48.521
I'll never forget that horrible face, never!

51:50.857 --> 51:52.358
What's that?

51:54.194 --> 51:56.695
Damn it, it's that battery.

51:56.780 --> 52:00.533
I charged it yesterday.
Must not have taken.

52:00.617 --> 52:03.285
It may just start anyway. Let me try.

52:10.710 --> 52:13.546
We're gonna have to walk back.
It's okay.

52:15.924 --> 52:17.716
- Okay?
- Yeah.

52:19.219 --> 52:21.470
I know a pretty good shortcut.

53:08.602 --> 53:09.935
Shelly?

53:44.137 --> 53:45.638
Heavy shit!

53:54.356 --> 53:55.981
Who's there?

54:03.323 --> 54:06.408
Shelly, if this is
another one of your tricks...

54:25.011 --> 54:27.179
Sorry, I didn't mean to scare you
like that.

54:27.264 --> 54:30.808
Between you and Shelly, I'm lucky
I haven't had a heart attack already.

54:30.892 --> 54:32.351
What's butterball up to now?

54:32.435 --> 54:35.562
I don't know.
He just ducked into the barn.

54:35.689 --> 54:38.023
Come on, let's give him
some of his own medicine.

54:50.078 --> 54:53.414
I don't think he's in here. Let's go back.

55:07.721 --> 55:10.222
Maybe that wasn't him.

55:10.348 --> 55:12.057
Chili.

55:23.236 --> 55:25.571
Are you crazy?

55:44.883 --> 55:49.470
- I guess he must've left.
- Come on, let's get out of here.

55:53.600 --> 55:55.601
I'm not going to let anybody hurt you.

55:55.727 --> 55:58.729
Gee, thanks. I feel a lot better now.

56:28.134 --> 56:30.052
That'll teach you a valuable lesson:

56:30.136 --> 56:34.807
A beautiful girl like you
should never go out in the dark alone.

56:35.975 --> 56:38.060
Damn it, Shelly!

56:38.144 --> 56:41.271
Why do you do these stupid things?

56:41.356 --> 56:45.025
- I have to.
- No, you don't have to.

56:45.151 --> 56:49.321
- I just want you to like me.
- I do like you.

56:49.447 --> 56:52.032
But not when you act like a jerk.

56:52.158 --> 56:55.577
Being a jerk
is better than being a nothing.

56:55.662 --> 57:00.833
- I never said you were nothing.
- You don't have to say it. I could tell.

57:02.168 --> 57:05.170
You're wrong. Shelly!

58:12.906 --> 58:15.115
Chuck? Chili?

58:16.409 --> 58:19.203
Hey. What are you guys doing in there?

58:42.435 --> 58:45.437
Are you guys doing something
I shouldn't see?

59:28.523 --> 59:30.107
That's great.

01:00:06.019 --> 01:00:08.103
Hey, I dropped your wallet.

01:00:08.187 --> 01:00:11.690
I'm sorry. I got it.

01:00:15.194 --> 01:00:16.695
Who are you?

01:00:18.489 --> 01:00:20.198
What are you doing?

01:00:21.200 --> 01:00:24.494
Hey, now cut that out right now.
That's not funny.

01:01:06.371 --> 01:01:08.622
That was the best one yet.

01:01:09.749 --> 01:01:13.418
Was it you, me or the hammock?

01:01:14.212 --> 01:01:17.756
- I vote for me.
- I vote for the hammock.

01:01:22.303 --> 01:01:23.720
Where you going?

01:01:23.805 --> 01:01:27.099
I'm taking a shower.
You ought to try it sometime.

01:01:35.942 --> 01:01:40.028
- Hey, Debbie, can you hear me?
- Barely.

01:01:40.113 --> 01:01:43.573
I'm gonna go downstairs
and get a brew. You want one?

01:01:57.463 --> 01:01:58.964
Andy?

01:02:07.640 --> 01:02:09.474
Oh, Jesus.

01:02:11.144 --> 01:02:13.562
- Do you want a beer or not?
- Sure.

01:02:13.646 --> 01:02:15.981
- All right. Be right back.
- Okay.

01:02:26.492 --> 01:02:27.659
Andy.

01:02:48.848 --> 01:02:50.807
- Andy!
- Yeah?

01:02:50.892 --> 01:02:52.851
Are you still out there?

01:02:56.689 --> 01:02:58.356
I can't hear you.

01:03:00.234 --> 01:03:01.401
Andy?

01:03:02.653 --> 01:03:05.071
Will you quit fooling around?

01:03:08.034 --> 01:03:09.701
Cut it out.

01:03:39.732 --> 01:03:43.693
Andy? I changed my mind.
I don't want that beer.

01:03:45.613 --> 01:04:15.642
Andy?

01:04:21.274 --> 01:04:24.609
Andy? Did you hear me about that beer?

01:04:27.071 --> 01:04:28.154
Andy!

01:04:29.615 --> 01:04:32.409
Oh, God,
I hate when you don't answer me.

01:05:05.568 --> 01:05:06.776
What?

01:05:09.196 --> 01:05:11.281
Where's this coming from?

01:05:17.330 --> 01:05:19.372
Great shortcut, Rick.

01:05:21.500 --> 01:05:25.503
- Come on, let's move it.
- Always spoiling my fun.

01:05:25.630 --> 01:05:27.797
- What was that noise?
- What?

01:05:27.882 --> 01:05:30.634
I don't know.
I heard something over there.

01:05:30.718 --> 01:05:32.677
Come on, let's get home.

01:05:47.526 --> 01:05:49.819
- Did I hear you screaming?
- No.

01:05:49.904 --> 01:05:52.656
It's probably Debbie having an orgasm.

01:05:52.740 --> 01:05:54.908
How come you never scream
when we have sex?

01:05:55.034 --> 01:05:57.577
Give me something to scream about.

01:05:59.246 --> 01:06:02.123
- What's the matter?
- Nothing. I was just practising.

01:06:02.208 --> 01:06:04.084
Don't do that to me!

01:06:04.210 --> 01:06:07.837
Here. Go down the cellar
and check the fuse box.

01:06:10.216 --> 01:06:12.217
In the dark? Alone?

01:06:12.343 --> 01:06:13.885
Be a man, man.

01:06:37.284 --> 01:06:41.287
Nothing to be afraid of, man.
So, what if it's dark?

01:06:45.418 --> 01:06:47.752
Nothing to be afraid of.

01:07:15.489 --> 01:07:16.990
Jeez!

01:07:19.744 --> 01:07:21.578
Oh, God.

01:07:28.794 --> 01:07:30.420
All right.

01:07:41.182 --> 01:07:42.640
Who's there?

01:07:46.145 --> 01:07:48.146
Chuck, you back already?

01:07:51.317 --> 01:07:55.195
Well, at least you got
the outside lights working.

01:07:55.488 --> 01:07:57.655
Nice makeup job.

01:08:00.201 --> 01:08:03.036
Stop fooling around, man.

01:08:16.133 --> 01:08:18.134
That's better.

01:08:35.194 --> 01:08:37.529
What's going on?

01:08:37.654 --> 01:08:39.279
Get up!

01:08:39.365 --> 01:08:42.117
Shelly, enough is enough!

01:08:45.703 --> 01:08:47.831
Oh, my God!

01:08:49.875 --> 01:08:52.544
Andy? Debbie?

01:08:53.837 --> 01:08:55.880
Shelly's dead!

01:08:57.883 --> 01:08:59.716
He's dead!

01:09:03.139 --> 01:09:05.723
Andy! Deb...

01:09:05.808 --> 01:09:07.517
No!

01:09:09.478 --> 01:09:12.313
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

01:09:45.514 --> 01:09:47.932
This wind sure came up.

01:09:54.607 --> 01:09:55.565
Seems awfully quiet.

01:09:57.693 --> 01:10:00.612
It's hard to believe
the wild bunch is already in bed.

01:10:00.696 --> 01:10:03.281
Yeah, well, who knows with those guys?

01:10:18.631 --> 01:10:21.883
I can't get this door open.
There's something behind it.

01:10:21.967 --> 01:10:25.887
- Oh, I smell something burning.
- Here, take this. Let me do it.

01:10:27.473 --> 01:10:31.726
No wonder. Some idiot put this chair
there. Something is burning.

01:10:31.810 --> 01:10:34.646
Lights aren't working either.

01:10:34.772 --> 01:10:38.399
Oh, real smart. What's going on here?

01:10:38.484 --> 01:10:40.652
You tell me. They're your friends.

01:10:40.736 --> 01:10:43.404
I'm gonna go out to the living room
and check what's going on there.

01:10:43.489 --> 01:10:44.656
Okay.

01:10:50.579 --> 01:10:53.164
Andy, Debbie, are you guys up there?

01:10:56.293 --> 01:10:57.961
Anybody here?

01:11:09.306 --> 01:11:11.349
Everybody else has taken off and left us.

01:11:11.475 --> 01:11:13.601
- They wouldn't do that.
- I don't know what's going on,

01:11:13.686 --> 01:11:16.854
but I'm gonna go outside
and take a look around.

01:11:17.356 --> 01:11:18.523
Rick, wait. I wanna come with you.

01:11:25.197 --> 01:11:27.365
Andy? Is that you?

01:11:28.284 --> 01:11:42.213
Rick?

01:11:49.680 --> 01:11:51.889
Is everything all right?

01:12:30.721 --> 01:12:32.764
Where's that coming from?

01:12:40.773 --> 01:12:45.443
I don't know what kind of game
you guys are playing, but I don't like it.

01:12:50.699 --> 01:12:53.618
Debbie? You guys up here?

01:13:00.959 --> 01:13:04.295
Hey, come on, you guys.
You're wrecking the house.

01:13:33.492 --> 01:13:43.918
Rick!

01:14:13.699 --> 01:14:16.325
Rick! Where are you?

01:15:03.665 --> 01:15:06.501
Rick! Help me!

01:15:22.267 --> 01:15:26.187
Rick!

01:15:28.106 --> 01:15:29.774
Rick! Rick!

01:15:35.405 --> 01:18:10.935
No!

01:19:07.159 --> 01:19:08.826
Keys. Keys!

01:19:11.538 --> 01:19:13.122
Come on!

01:19:50.327 --> 01:19:52.036
What's happening?

01:19:57.584 --> 01:19:59.043
No!

01:20:01.880 --> 01:20:04.590
Come on. Come on!

01:20:16.561 --> 01:20:18.020
Gas.

01:26:03.366 --> 01:26:05.409
You can't be alive.

01:26:07.078 --> 01:26:08.203
You!

01:26:19.132 --> 01:26:21.300
You psycho!

01:29:18.269 --> 01:29:19.311
No!

01:29:20.646 --> 01:29:23.273
No! No! No!

01:29:27.987 --> 01:29:29.112
No!

01:30:29.006 --> 01:30:31.174
Looks like she's the only one left alive.

01:30:31.259 --> 01:30:33.176
What was all that
about a lady in the lake?

01:30:33.261 --> 01:30:35.720
She must've flipped out.
That poor kid's been through hell.

01:30:35.847 --> 01:30:37.848
All of her friends...

01:30:37.932 --> 01:30:39.516
I'll take her.

01:31:05.585 --> 01:31:10.130
It's okay. You're gonna be all right.
You're gonna be fine.
