Welcome to the first live semifinal
of Britain's Got Talent.

00:18.165 --> 00:21.324
You have so much energy.
It was unbelievable.

00:21.325 --> 00:23.524
We haven't seen anything like it.

00:23.525 --> 00:26.085
I have been disabled
since before it was popular.

00:29.525 --> 00:31.684
Really well put together.

00:31.685 --> 00:34.244
When you've got it, you've got it.

00:34.245 --> 00:38.164

00:43.125 --> 00:45.884
I feel even more special than usual.

00:45.885 --> 00:48.964
I'm going to go with Maddox.
D-Day Darlings.

00:48.965 --> 00:51.925
The D-Day girls. I've got to give
this to the D-Day Darlings.

00:57.245 --> 00:59.364
It's been a lot of hard work but
it's paying off.

00:59.365 --> 01:02.805
I'm so proud to be going through
to the final.

01:07.685 --> 01:11.564

02:18.605 --> 02:20.485
I haven't even got lucky pants on.

02:23.165 --> 02:26.005
I don't have time for this.
Oh, perfect!

02:29.445 --> 02:32.525
No! I'm not doing panto! Yet.

02:36.085 --> 02:39.084
No, not this! I'm saving this
for the final.

Oh, my goodness.
You're another loud bunch tonight.

03:25.845 --> 03:29.444
We kicked off the semifinals
in style last night,

03:29.445 --> 03:33.444
and tonight we have more great
performances, more amazing talent,

03:33.445 --> 03:37.324
but hopefully, fewer thunderstorms.
(LAUGHTER)

03:37.325 --> 03:40.404
We would like to stay on the air
all night.

03:40.405 --> 03:43.364
We've got eight acts tonight,

03:43.365 --> 03:46.884
all determined to stay in the running
to win Â£250,000

03:46.885 --> 03:51.124

04:36.965 --> 04:41.605
Another fantastic crowd.
Just for you.

04:43.005 --> 04:47.084
You remember last night,
Lost Voice Guy and the D-Day Darlings

04:47.085 --> 04:49.884
were the first two acts through
to this year's final.

04:49.885 --> 04:52.364
Tonight we've got another fantastic
line-up.

04:52.365 --> 04:55.004
Before that,
let's say hello to our judges.

04:55.005 --> 04:59.924
David, we've got your Golden Buzzer
act, Donchez Dacres.

04:59.925 --> 05:01.204
Are you excited?

05:01.205 --> 05:02.604
Really excited.

05:02.605 --> 05:05.004
We've been hanging out backstage.

05:05.005 --> 05:09.604
He's really excited about being
on the show, especially tonight,

05:09.605 --> 05:13.164
and I think it's going to be
a really big night for him.

05:13.165 --> 05:15.524
Very big. You've got
your special red shirt on.

05:15.525 --> 05:19.204
Do you like it? You have special
red shoes on as well.

05:19.205 --> 05:21.524
We're kind of matching!

05:21.525 --> 05:24.804
Can you do that one more time?
Look at the stitching.

05:24.805 --> 05:27.324
On the back of your shoe!
Look at the stitching!

05:27.325 --> 05:31.844
Don't do that! I want to see you
introduce everyone like this!

05:31.845 --> 05:35.964
Alesha, who were you sad to see go?

05:35.965 --> 05:41.484
I was really sad to see Cali Swing
go, and Lifford. Maddox.

05:41.485 --> 05:45.684
That's the tough thing, Good people
are going to go, that's the name
of the game.

05:45.685 --> 05:49.084
It is. Amanda, we are in our new home
here in Hammersmith.

05:49.085 --> 05:53.684
It's a big venue. Does that mean
the acts have to raise their game?

05:53.685 --> 05:58.404
Size is everything, as you know,
Dec. (DAVID LAUGHS)

05:58.405 --> 06:01.484
I would say the answer to that
is yes.

06:01.485 --> 06:05.484
Last night felt like I was
at Wembley.

06:05.485 --> 06:09.204
It felt like an event. I think that
everybody had to raise the roof.

06:09.205 --> 06:11.844
The energy levels were huge
compared to last year.

06:11.845 --> 06:15.044
At Wembley Conference Centre!

06:15.045 --> 06:17.644
Simon, even though we are in the
semifinals,

06:17.645 --> 06:21.164
you guys are still quite critical,
as you proved last night.

06:21.165 --> 06:23.084
Him in particular.

06:23.085 --> 06:28.444
Quite rude. We are here to have an
opinion. That is why we are here.

06:28.445 --> 06:31.524
Last year it was like we did
nothing.

06:31.525 --> 06:35.244
We can slightly make a decision,
which is a good thing.

06:35.245 --> 06:39.564
We try to be honest. If people
aren't great, that's the way it
goes.

06:39.565 --> 06:45.604
Thank you, judges. Lovely to see you
all. Let's kick off semifinal number
two.

06:45.605 --> 06:48.044
First up, they are a singing group
who are determined

06:48.045 --> 06:51.924
to deliver a big performance
with an even bigger message.

06:51.925 --> 06:54.885
It's B-Positive Choir.
(CHEERING)

06:56.045 --> 06:59.684
We are a choir from all over the UK.

06:59.685 --> 07:06.804
We come together to make everybody
aware. We want everybody to give
blood.

07:06.805 --> 07:10.005
# Rise up #

07:11.565 --> 07:16.044
I found it really moving because
blood donors saved my life.

07:16.045 --> 07:19.204
It is the reason I am still
a mummy to two girls.

07:19.205 --> 07:24.004
Since the audition, the response has
been amazing.

07:24.005 --> 07:29.364
People have come up to me and said,
"I'm gonna make sure I go and
register."

07:29.365 --> 07:33.364
I suffer from sickle cell, which is
a horrible illness.

07:33.365 --> 07:36.364
You get chronic fatigue.
I have had kidney failure.

07:36.365 --> 07:38.484
So it does interrupt your life.

07:38.485 --> 07:43.124
The fact that people donate blood
is why I am here to sing.

07:43.125 --> 07:44.605
It's just amazing.

07:46.645 --> 07:51.484
Singing for the semifinals tonight,
we are really excited. We really love
this song.

07:51.485 --> 07:54.364
Everybody's been working so hard.

07:54.365 --> 07:57.045
They're not just singing words.
There is a message there.

07:58.325 --> 08:03.884
Tonight will be an amazing night.
You will see us

08:03.885 --> 08:07.564
as you've never heard a choir
ever before.

08:07.565 --> 08:10.364
ALL: We are B-Positive.

08:10.365 --> 08:12.365

08:20.405 --> 08:24.604

08:27.325 --> 08:30.004

your broken parts

08:30.005 --> 08:32.325
# But I won't let them break me

gonna drown them out

# I am who I'm meant to be,
this is me

08:59.445 --> 09:02.125
# Look out cos here I come

09:04.165 --> 09:06.845
# And I'm marching on to the beat

# Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh

09:29.125 --> 09:32.004
# We are bursting through
the barricades

09:32.005 --> 09:34.284
# And reaching for the sun

09:34.285 --> 09:36.004
# We are warriors

09:36.005 --> 09:39.684
# Yeah, that's what we've become

09:39.685 --> 09:42.204
# I won't let them break me
down to dust

09:42.205 --> 09:45.484
# I know that there's a place for us

10:27.165 --> 10:29.765
(WILD CHEERING)

10:46.485 --> 10:49.004
Wow, what a start! David.

10:49.005 --> 10:52.484
I am just stunned.

10:52.485 --> 10:57.284
It blew me and all the judges and
everyone away.

10:57.285 --> 11:01.165
I'm sure everyone at home too.
(CHEERING)

11:02.565 --> 11:07.044
You've got a brilliant message
as well.

11:07.045 --> 11:13.164
Just judging you purely as a
performance, it was out of this
world. Well done.

11:13.165 --> 11:14.925
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

11:16.685 --> 11:20.444
I think that has to be one of the
most powerful openers we've ever had

11:20.445 --> 11:23.244
on a live show. It was
absolutely spectacular.

11:23.245 --> 11:25.004
Such an important message.

11:25.005 --> 11:28.724
The passion and soul pouring out of
you is infectious.

11:28.725 --> 11:31.044
I thought that was fantastic.

11:31.045 --> 11:33.485
(CHEERING)

11:35.805 --> 11:40.404
As David said, the message is clear.
What I love is the honesty.

11:40.405 --> 11:44.964
It is really raw. Every one of your
faces is concentrating.

11:44.965 --> 11:49.324
There is a fire inside of you
and it burns so bright.

11:49.325 --> 11:53.045
It was absolutely fantastic.
(CHEERING)

11:56.365 --> 12:01.564
That song. You would have to be
a lizard not to love that
performance.

12:01.565 --> 12:05.924
It really is special. I want you to
remind me and the audience at home

12:05.925 --> 12:12.124
why you came on the show and why
going through to the final
is important to you.

12:12.125 --> 12:17.644
It is so important to us. We want
everybody to know - give blood.

12:17.645 --> 12:20.084
Register and give blood.

12:20.085 --> 12:25.404
It can save a life and improve
a life.

12:25.405 --> 12:28.804
It's as simple as that. That is what
we're all about.

12:28.805 --> 12:32.724
I wanted to remind everyone because
I think it is important.

12:32.725 --> 12:36.924
But also, in the context of the
show, it is a competition.

12:36.925 --> 12:41.004
We really liked you the first time
we saw you. You sang Rise Up.

12:41.005 --> 12:46.044
This for me was a massive step up.
It was the perfect song.

12:46.045 --> 12:47.764
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

12:47.765 --> 12:53.764
I think the lyric is about
everything that everybody should be
thinking about today.

12:53.765 --> 12:56.484
This Is Me. So positive, so
brilliant.

12:56.485 --> 12:58.444
You're brilliant. We all loved it.

12:58.445 --> 12:59.924
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

12:59.925 --> 13:04.524
There you go, in a nutshell.
Thank you, judges.

13:04.525 --> 13:07.684

13:39.165 --> 13:41.804
Probably won't, but it could.
Right, time for a break,

13:41.805 --> 13:45.044
but we'll be right back with demonic
dance from Futunity.

13:45.045 --> 13:47.085
We will see you in a few minutes.

13:51.568 --> 13:53.887
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

13:55.160 --> 13:58.079
Welcome back to Britain's Got Talent
and semifinal number two,

13:58.080 --> 14:01.617
where the race is on for the big
final on Sunday.

14:01.619 --> 14:04.738
Next up tonight are dance crew called
Futunity,

14:04.739 --> 14:11.258
whose name comes from a combination
of the words "future" and "unity".

14:11.259 --> 14:12.578
Clever, isn't it?

14:12.579 --> 14:16.498
Take it from me, these guys are all
about dedication and imagination,

14:16.499 --> 14:19.898
or as I like to call it,
dedi-cay-shination.

14:19.899 --> 14:22.739
I think that works. It's Futunity!

14:24.299 --> 14:26.778

Thank you. Let's see what the judges

I love nothing more than seeing
a crew of talented young individuals

18:28.659 --> 18:32.698
giving their heart and soul
to the thing they love to do most.

18:32.699 --> 18:34.658

You did a brilliant job from start

It felt apocalyptic, but in a

18:51.179 --> 18:55.298
I feel like dance has really moved
on with our show now.

18:55.299 --> 19:01.258

when you come on to this stage

Welcome back the the second live

21:14.909 --> 21:17.109
I'm back here with the riffraff.
Very lively.

21:18.389 --> 21:22.628
Next up tonight is a small boy
who had plenty of support
at the auditions,

21:22.629 --> 21:27.428
but this week, he's got to cope with
the main stage on Britain's Got
Talent all on his own.

21:27.429 --> 21:30.549
I know how he feels.
It's Calum Courtney!

21:33.029 --> 21:36.788
My name is Calum. I'm ten years old
and I live in Essex

21:36.789 --> 21:40.388
with my mum, my dad and brother.

21:40.389 --> 21:43.868
I was diagnosed with autism just over
a year ago.

21:43.869 --> 21:48.548
For me, it means I struggle with
learning and sometimes with friends.

21:48.549 --> 21:51.708
But please don't feel sorry for me.

21:51.709 --> 21:53.948
Even though it takes things away from
me,

21:53.949 --> 21:58.228
it helps me with my music,
and music is my passion.

21:58.229 --> 21:59.868
Go on, pal.

21:59.869 --> 22:03.388
I really enjoyed my first audition
at Britain's Got Talent.

22:03.389 --> 22:05.748
The crowd loved me,

22:05.749 --> 22:07.908
much more than I ever believed.

22:07.909 --> 22:10.468
And that made me cry.

22:10.469 --> 22:12.148
I never usually cry.

22:12.149 --> 22:15.108
3,700 yeses?

22:15.109 --> 22:18.828
I can't believe that I'm actually
through to the semifinals.

22:18.829 --> 22:20.869
I never thought I was that good.

22:22.229 --> 22:25.988
But now I am through, I feel much
more confident.

22:25.989 --> 22:28.668
I can't wait to sing again

22:28.669 --> 22:31.829
and I am going to do my best
performance ever.

22:33.389 --> 22:35.548
I hope my mum will love it from the
audience,

22:35.549 --> 22:38.309
as there is something special
just for her.

that popular.

I thought it was really cute.

26:06.789 --> 26:13.788

has to start with being likeable
and popular.

26:13.789 --> 26:17.788

26:17.789 --> 26:20.548

as well.

here. This is daunting, trust me.

26:28.149 --> 26:31.828
You got all the word right,
you sang in pitch.

26:31.829 --> 26:35.708
So wherever you decide where you
want to be,

26:35.709 --> 26:37.988
you have done the hard part now.

I just think it's a song
that everyone would love to be able
to sing to their mother.

26:58.149 --> 27:00.988
I can't sing or dance.
I have no talent.

27:00.989 --> 27:05.708

and that was a beautiful

28:10.229 --> 28:12.908
It meant at school
I found things very difficult.

28:12.909 --> 28:17.389
I started doing impressions and it
became the thing I was good at.

28:18.909 --> 28:24.388
I've been trying to make a career out
of performing for the last 15 years.

28:24.389 --> 28:28.668
It's not been easy. I've worked in
a biscuit factory, promotions,
supermarkets,

28:28.669 --> 28:30.828
binman for a little while.

28:30.829 --> 28:35.988

It's always great when you discover
someone like you.

28:44.669 --> 28:47.109
I'll treasure that. I really will.

little things

28:57.429 --> 29:00.628
that make that human being

29:00.629 --> 29:03.308
I'd love to have my own
impressionist comedy show,

29:03.309 --> 29:06.428
and be able to support a family,
my future.

29:06.429 --> 29:08.508
This is a huge moment.

bodyguard.

29:49.429 --> 29:53.108
You got knights in Britain.
Knights make great bodyguards.

29:53.109 --> 29:57.188

30:05.749 --> 30:08.548
(LAUGHTER)

30:08.549 --> 30:12.708
The Trumposaurus will make being
a bodyguard very difficult,

30:12.709 --> 30:16.268
as he responds almost always
in a display of aggression

30:16.269 --> 30:19.108
to any sign of provocation.

31:20.749 --> 31:25.428
No. Williams. And er, er, er, him!

31:25.429 --> 31:28.628
No, no, that Irish bloke,
lives in a castle. Louis Walsh!

31:28.629 --> 31:30.308
(LAUGHTER)

31:30.309 --> 31:31.948
Yes. Jolly good. Jolly good.

31:31.949 --> 31:33.949
(APPLAUSE)

31:39.069 --> 31:41.348
(AS TRUMP)
I just love that guy's hair.

31:41.349 --> 31:43.388
Finally, folks, your Brexit.

31:43.389 --> 31:45.948
You gotta get your Brexit
sorted out, folks.

31:45.949 --> 31:50.068
If you want a trade deal with China,

31:50.069 --> 31:54.108
I propose your mucho macho actor
Sean Bean be in charge.

31:54.109 --> 31:56.789
He's a very tough cookie,
he's gonna do a great job.

31:59.869 --> 32:05.828
(AS SEAN BEAN) Under the auspices of
Donald Trump, I will take my men,

32:05.829 --> 32:07.948
with swords and shields

32:07.949 --> 32:11.349
to France,
and slay every dragon in the EU!

32:12.509 --> 32:16.789
'Ey, let's just build a great big
wall! Champion!

32:18.469 --> 32:19.909
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

32:22.589 --> 32:24.668
(AS DONALD TRUMP)
I love it, a big wall.

32:24.669 --> 32:27.108
And who is gonna pay for the wall,
folks?

32:27.109 --> 32:31.068
(AUDIENCE SHOUT)
No, not Mexico.

32:31.069 --> 32:32.948
The... The others.

32:32.949 --> 32:36.708
Folks, these are others. It's a joke.
It doesn't matter. Doesn't matter.

32:36.709 --> 32:42.188
So, folks, these are my ideas to
bring our two nations closer
together.

32:42.189 --> 32:44.308
But I know what you're thinking.

32:44.309 --> 32:47.548
Why would such a beautiful nation
wanna join forces

32:47.549 --> 32:51.348
with a big-headed megalomaniac
with far too much money,

32:51.349 --> 32:52.748
terrible, terrible hair

32:52.749 --> 32:55.788
and a really weird voice?

32:55.789 --> 33:00.148
But folks, if America wants to work
with Simon Cowell, that's no problem.
(LAUGHTER)

33:00.149 --> 33:04.388
Good night, God bless you and may
God bless Britain's Got Trump!

33:04.389 --> 33:07.149
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

33:22.309 --> 33:23.468
Well, Simon.

33:23.469 --> 33:27.868
Ironically, I thought that joke
at the end was the funniest part.

33:27.869 --> 33:29.708
Literally.

33:29.709 --> 33:32.748
I was thinking that you're very
funny...

33:32.749 --> 33:34.628
Nu, you're a good impressionist,

33:34.629 --> 33:37.028
but the act you repeated twice.

33:37.029 --> 33:39.988
Your impressions are better
than the dialogue.

33:39.989 --> 33:43.228
You didn't have...
(AUDIENCE JEER)

33:43.229 --> 33:46.148
You didn't have what you
should have had at this moment,

33:46.149 --> 33:49.948
which is an absolute wow moment.

33:49.949 --> 33:53.668
It wasn't a moment, it was
an extension of the audition.

33:53.669 --> 33:55.868
I don't think this will take you to
the final.

33:55.869 --> 33:59.188
I did think the end part
was quite funny.

33:59.189 --> 34:06.108
But it didn't crack me up. That is
what you have to do at this part of
the competition.

34:06.109 --> 34:09.069
Maybe the public will feel
different. MAN: Rubbish!

34:12.389 --> 34:14.509
He's not renowned for his sense of
humour.

34:16.109 --> 34:18.068
Er, I thought it was very funny.

34:18.069 --> 34:21.908
The impressions are fantastic.
I like that it is satirical as well.

34:21.909 --> 34:23.908
(CHEERING)

34:23.909 --> 34:30.348
It was very funny watching Simon's
face as I could tell the joke was
coming

34:30.349 --> 34:33.109
and that terrible false smile
on his face!

34:34.268 --> 34:36.027
But no, you did brilliantly tonight.

34:36.029 --> 34:39.388
Comedy is the hardest thing to do on
the stage of Britain's Got Talent,

34:39.389 --> 34:42.188
and you did really well.
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

34:42.188 --> 34:46.947
It's such a hard thing to do. You've
mastered the art of the impressions.

34:46.949 --> 34:51.708
I think you're a really likeable
guy and I hope people at home
enjoyed it, cos it was very funny.

34:51.708 --> 34:54.069
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

34:55.589 --> 34:59.948
Just reiterating what David said,
there's no backing dancers,

34:59.949 --> 35:01.988
there were a couple of security men.

35:01.989 --> 35:05.988
So this is the hardest thing to do.
There is no backup.

35:05.989 --> 35:09.468
You did really well. You have a
great face for this.

35:09.469 --> 35:14.148
It sort of blends into
all the characters, like clay.

35:14.149 --> 35:16.868
It's very good.
You have a clay face.

35:16.869 --> 35:18.628
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

35:18.629 --> 35:20.708
I think that's a compliment!

35:20.709 --> 35:23.988
If Andrew has made
a good impression on you,

35:23.989 --> 35:27.428
details are onscreen now,
or you can vote via the app.

35:27.429 --> 35:31.268
But not yet. Voting doesn't open
until the last act has performed.

35:31.269 --> 35:33.748
One more time, Andrew Lancaster,
everybody!

35:33.749 --> 35:35.989
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

35:45.429 --> 35:46.628
Time for a quick break,

35:46.629 --> 35:50.388
but when we come back, we've got big
laughs from comedian Nick Page,

35:50.389 --> 35:53.668
and a big voice
from opera singer Ronan Busfield.

35:53.669 --> 35:57.509
See you in just a few minutes.
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

36:02.213 --> 36:06.452
(CHEERING) Welcome back
to Britain's Got Talent,

36:06.454 --> 36:08.493
another semi-final live.

36:08.494 --> 36:10.595
Now, next up tonight is
a stand-up comedian.

36:10.597 --> 36:14.796
The Godfather of Giggles, the Lord
of LOLs and TV's Mr Chuckles

36:14.797 --> 36:17.836
are just three of the names
he's asked me to stop calling him.

36:17.837 --> 36:19.876
It's Nick Page.

36:19.877 --> 36:21.877
(CHEERING)

36:23.317 --> 36:26.796
I'm Nick Page. I'm 47 years old
and I'm from Gloucestershire.

36:26.797 --> 36:28.836
# On the road again... #
(HORN HONKS)

36:28.837 --> 36:31.636
Being a comic, you do spend an awful
lot of time on the road,

36:31.637 --> 36:34.037
cos the gigs are literally
all over the country.

36:35.077 --> 36:36.716
You very quickly build up

36:36.717 --> 36:40.076
an encyclopaedic knowledge of petrol
stations and service stations.

36:40.077 --> 36:41.756
Once I got to the end of a week

36:41.757 --> 36:44.756
and I realised I hadn't eaten
a single meal with cutlery.

36:44.757 --> 36:47.476
(CHEERING)
Most gigs are worth the journey...

36:47.477 --> 36:52.076
I'm old enough that I've now got
a favourite motorway services.

36:52.077 --> 36:54.596
..a few others, maybe not.
(LAUGHS)

36:54.597 --> 36:56.636
# On the road again... #
(HORN HONKS)

36:56.637 --> 36:59.356
(TYRES SCREECH) Before I was
a comic, I was a bouncer,

36:59.357 --> 37:02.436
and then I was a car dealer and then
I was an estate agent.

37:02.437 --> 37:04.556
So I'd only have to be a politician

37:04.557 --> 37:07.516
to do the full house of jobs that
people hate.

37:07.517 --> 37:09.556
# Don't stop... #

37:09.557 --> 37:12.356
My audition for Britain's Got
Talent was an amazing day.

37:12.357 --> 37:15.836
The nearest I've got to a hobby is
this, I quite like highlighter pens.

37:15.837 --> 37:17.876
(GUFFAWS)

37:17.877 --> 37:21.316
That moment where you get that first
big laugh from an audience,

37:21.317 --> 37:23.517
there is no feeling like it
on earth.

37:24.597 --> 37:27.076
I am really excited about the
semi-finals.

37:27.077 --> 37:29.116
I'm nervous, but I'm hoping that

37:29.117 --> 37:31.796
the 16 years of hard work is going
to pay off tonight.

37:31.797 --> 37:34.396
(CHEERING)

37:34.397 --> 37:36.436
Hello. (CHUCKLES)

37:36.437 --> 37:38.437
(WHISTLING)

37:42.957 --> 37:46.236
Hello!
AUDIENCE: Hello!

37:46.237 --> 37:48.476
Wow!

37:48.477 --> 37:51.916
Before we start, just a little
warning, I do talk quite quickly

37:51.917 --> 37:54.556
so, if at any point you reckon
I'm talking too quick,

37:54.557 --> 37:57.036
all you've got to do:
think a little bit faster.

37:57.037 --> 37:58.676
(LAUGHTER)

37:58.677 --> 38:00.956
I am properly humble to be here.

38:00.957 --> 38:03.316
There's amazing acts from all over
the world.

38:03.317 --> 38:05.076
I can't compete with that.

38:05.077 --> 38:06.716
It's just me.

38:06.717 --> 38:08.636
Aw!
I know.

38:08.637 --> 38:11.876
And some people don't even think
I should be on this stage.

38:11.877 --> 38:16.196
Awww! I know. I came on after the
yodelling hamster juggler

38:16.197 --> 38:18.876
and it was me who got the heckle.
(LAUGHTER)

38:18.877 --> 38:21.236
I think it's cos
I don't look showbiz.

38:21.237 --> 38:25.236
I look like a bloke who's come to
have a chat with your dad about
joists.

38:25.237 --> 38:28.276
I just...
I've always looked a little bit old

38:28.277 --> 38:30.316
and I've started doing
old man stuff.

38:30.317 --> 38:33.557
I recently bought a pair of jeans at
a supermarket...

38:34.997 --> 38:37.476
..and within an hour,
I was strutting around going,

38:37.477 --> 38:40.477
"Look at these. They only cost
Â£4.80. Guess where I got 'em?"

38:42.677 --> 38:45.356
Within an hour-and-a-half, I was
calling them...

38:45.357 --> 38:48.957
Within an hour-and-a-half, I was
calling them my "going out jeans."

38:50.597 --> 38:52.516
Trust me, if you're out at the
weekend

38:52.517 --> 38:56.676
and your jeans cost less than your
first drink, you shouldn't be out.

38:56.677 --> 38:58.277
(LAUGHTER)

38:59.917 --> 39:01.917
(CHEERING)

39:05.397 --> 39:08.196
I'm old enough that I should be able
to give people advice,

39:08.197 --> 39:10.716
but I've got no advice to give,
apart from this.

39:10.717 --> 39:14.516
Always buy engagement rings a bit
bigger than you reckon you need 'em.

39:14.517 --> 39:16.156
(LAUGHTER)

39:16.157 --> 39:18.396
That way, when you apply it,
you can go,

39:18.397 --> 39:21.636
"Ooh, you've lost weight", which
always gets you Brownie points...

39:21.637 --> 39:23.556
(CHEERING) ..but more importantly,

39:23.557 --> 39:25.996
it means you can get it back without
waking 'em up.

39:25.997 --> 39:27.997
(LAUGHTER)

39:30.277 --> 39:32.277
(CHEERING)

39:34.597 --> 39:39.156
Trust me, nobody wants to be woken
up by having their ring finger lubed.

39:39.157 --> 39:41.157
(LAUGHTER)

39:45.757 --> 39:47.796
Woo!

39:47.797 --> 39:49.797
(CHEERING)

39:52.317 --> 39:54.236
I'm proper hairy too.

39:54.237 --> 39:56.796
I'm like one of those blokes who's
got a full pelt.

39:56.797 --> 40:00.196
I'm hairy enough that I'm allowed to
swim at my local leisure centre,

40:00.197 --> 40:02.036
for free,

40:02.037 --> 40:04.277
because I provide filtration.

40:05.837 --> 40:07.676
I do a length underwater,
I get out,

40:07.677 --> 40:09.356
they give me a comb and a dustpan.

40:09.357 --> 40:12.556
I give them back plasters,
locker keys, chewing gum, change...

40:12.557 --> 40:14.436
(LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE)

40:14.437 --> 40:16.356
And then I went to get waxed.

40:16.357 --> 40:19.596
I was booked in for the back, sack
and crack wax,

40:19.597 --> 40:21.197
you know the one, Simon.

40:22.357 --> 40:24.196
But it hurt.

40:24.197 --> 40:27.756
By the time they'd done one shoulder,
I was crying and I tried to escape.

40:27.757 --> 40:31.437
It turns out beauticians are
stronger and cleverer than they look.

40:32.797 --> 40:35.156
They went round
in a pincer movement.

40:35.157 --> 40:38.676
Pulled me down, they tried to get my
trousers down to finish the job.

40:38.677 --> 40:41.116
I held onto my belt buckle
so tightly

40:41.117 --> 40:44.476
I had the imprint of an eagle on my
hand for a month

40:44.477 --> 40:48.116
and people thought I was one of the
baddies from Raiders Of The Lost Ark.

40:48.117 --> 40:50.156
(LAUGHTER)

40:50.157 --> 40:52.916
I think my big strength here is that
I am properly British.

40:52.917 --> 40:56.196
Give me a cheer if you're British!
(CHEERING)

40:56.197 --> 40:58.436
This is how I know I'm British.

40:58.437 --> 41:01.796
I'm British because my main
motivation in everything I do

41:01.797 --> 41:03.836
is to slightly annoy my neighbours.

41:03.837 --> 41:05.596
(LAUGHTER)

41:05.597 --> 41:08.956
Weirdly, I didn't get invited
to the Royal wedding...

41:08.957 --> 41:11.676
Woo!
..even though I'm so British that

41:11.677 --> 41:14.436
I recently helped a mate to do his
Citizenship Test.

41:14.437 --> 41:18.797
He'd been Greek for ages, but then
he ran out of plates at his audition.

41:20.637 --> 41:23.716
So I helped him do it. The thing is,
the Citizenship Test

41:23.717 --> 41:26.636
isn't a test of being British,
it's a history exam.

41:26.637 --> 41:30.836
I reckon it should be a test of the
things that British people know,

41:30.837 --> 41:33.876
cos there are things you know, yes?
Yes!

41:33.877 --> 41:37.236
There are things you've always known
and don't know how you know.

41:37.237 --> 41:39.356
When I shout out these things,

41:39.357 --> 41:41.356
you'll know the answers.
Are you ready?

41:41.357 --> 41:43.276
Yes!
(BUZZER)

41:43.277 --> 41:45.476
Nice to see you, to see you...

41:45.477 --> 41:47.116
Nice!

41:47.117 --> 41:48.716
What do points win?

41:48.717 --> 41:50.276
Prizes.

41:50.277 --> 41:52.036
You're only supposed to blow...

41:52.037 --> 41:53.916
..the bloody doors off.

41:53.917 --> 41:56.036
Very good.
Shall we go for the final one?

41:56.037 --> 41:58.396
I need my trousers a bit higher.

41:58.397 --> 42:00.476
I didn't like it...

42:00.477 --> 42:02.716
I loved it!

42:02.717 --> 42:05.636
Thank you very much, ladies and
gentlemen. Good night!

42:05.637 --> 42:07.637
(CHEERING)

42:12.397 --> 42:14.397
(WHISTLING)

42:19.837 --> 42:22.276
Well done.
(APPLAUSE DROWNS SPEECH)

42:22.277 --> 42:24.957
Right. Let's start with you, David.

42:25.997 --> 42:28.236
Nick, you are a very funny guy.

42:28.237 --> 42:29.876
Erm...

42:29.877 --> 42:33.116
I'm always known as the nice one
on this show. It's not hard.

42:33.117 --> 42:36.156
But I wish it had gone a little
better for you tonight.

42:36.157 --> 42:38.556
I felt it was just getting there,

42:38.557 --> 42:41.956
but somehow, just some of the
material didn't quite take off.

42:41.957 --> 42:45.596
But you're a very funny guy. I'm
sure you... (BOOING)

42:45.597 --> 42:48.516
All right, I'm sorry.
I was being honest.

42:48.517 --> 42:52.156
But you're a funny guy, I'm sure
you're going to have a big future.

42:52.157 --> 42:54.196
Thank you.
(CHEERING)

42:54.197 --> 42:57.196
You know, it started really well.

42:57.197 --> 42:59.556
But then I think you did lose your
way.

42:59.557 --> 43:02.116
I just wasn't belly laughing like I
wanted to,

43:02.117 --> 43:04.876
but I was willing you to do well as
I think you are a great guy.

43:04.877 --> 43:08.116
I remember you from your audition.
I loved the way you heckled back

43:08.117 --> 43:10.756
at somebody that had given you
a bit of a hard time.

43:10.757 --> 43:13.676
You were thinking on your feet.
I think you have potential.

43:13.677 --> 43:16.717
I'm just not sure tonight has been
your night, Nick, I'm sorry.

43:18.157 --> 43:20.196
Erm, Nick, yeah, gosh.

43:20.197 --> 43:22.476
You had so many clever lines.

43:22.477 --> 43:24.316
I loved the leisure centre stuff.

43:24.317 --> 43:28.076
I loved the whole - Lube. The lube,
yeah, everyone knows me well.

43:28.077 --> 43:30.316
Anything like that.

43:30.317 --> 43:34.076
I just think you've got
some really, really good lines.

43:34.077 --> 43:37.676
Oh, gosh, and I know you've been
doing this for so long,

43:37.677 --> 43:41.156
but I just don't think you're there
yet, if I'm honest.

43:41.157 --> 43:43.196
I think that this act needs honing

43:43.197 --> 43:45.596
and I think there needs to be some
better material

43:45.597 --> 43:47.237
and I'm sorry.

43:49.557 --> 43:51.836
Nick, part of me gave you
the buzzer

43:51.837 --> 43:53.996
cos it was the equivalent of
heckling you.

43:53.997 --> 43:57.636
Cos you're better. I thought it
would kind of rev you up,

43:57.637 --> 43:59.916
because I didn't get the jokes.

43:59.917 --> 44:02.716
I was sort of halfway behind you
the whole time.

44:02.717 --> 44:05.876
I like you. You are a nice guy. You
know this is the hardest thing.

44:05.877 --> 44:08.196
I always say being a stand-up on
this stage

44:08.197 --> 44:10.716
is a nightmare thing to do.
Yeah.

44:10.717 --> 44:14.156
So, er, maybe it was just one of
those nights

44:14.157 --> 44:15.996
or maybe we're completely wrong.

44:15.997 --> 44:19.196
This is the public that decides,
not us, but I'm sorry.

44:19.197 --> 44:21.876
Exactly, it is up to the folks at
home.

44:21.877 --> 44:25.876
And if you want to see Nick in the
final on Sunday, then vote for him.

44:25.877 --> 44:28.836
Follow the instructions onscreen now
or vote via the app.

44:28.837 --> 44:31.596
Remember, the vote doesn't open
till the end of the show.

44:31.597 --> 44:34.236
Let's hear it for him, ladies and
gentlemen. Nick Page!

44:34.237 --> 44:36.237
(CHEERING)

44:42.357 --> 44:46.396
Now, our next act is a singer
who works in a supermarket

44:46.397 --> 44:49.276
and he's got something pretty
special on offer tonight.

44:49.277 --> 44:51.277
It's Ronan Busfield.

44:55.077 --> 44:58.196
Once upon a time, there lived
a little boy called Ronan.

44:58.197 --> 45:01.996
Ronan's favourite thing
in the whole world was to sing.

45:01.997 --> 45:04.716
He used to dream about what it would
be like

45:04.717 --> 45:07.036
to sing on some of the greatest
stages.

45:07.037 --> 45:08.676
And that made him happy.

45:08.677 --> 45:13.116
When Ronan grew up, he met the most
beautiful girl that he'd ever seen.

45:13.117 --> 45:15.996
She was called Catherine
and they fell in love,

45:15.997 --> 45:20.556
got married and had a gorgeous baby
boy called Rory.

45:20.557 --> 45:22.557
And that's you! You're Rory!

45:23.597 --> 45:27.996
He got a job working for a
supermarket but still, every day,

45:27.997 --> 45:29.836
he'd dream about
what it would be like

45:29.837 --> 45:33.157
to sing on the stages he'd spent
so many years imagining.

45:35.757 --> 45:40.396
Do you know what he did? He went to
sing for some very famous people.

45:40.397 --> 45:42.676
They all thought that Ronan sang
beautifully

45:42.677 --> 45:44.997
and that made him happy.
(CHEERING)

45:47.837 --> 45:51.557
And the dream he'd had for such
a long time had finally came true.

45:52.717 --> 45:55.676
# So why don't we go

45:55.677 --> 45:59.116
# Somewhere only we know?

45:59.117 --> 46:00.956
It's good to have a dream, Rory.

46:00.957 --> 46:04.996
# Somewhere only we know? #

48:53.917 --> 48:55.556
Alesha?

48:55.557 --> 49:01.276
I think once you started to really
get into that song, you came alive.

49:01.277 --> 49:03.876
You know, about halfway through,
you just took off

49:03.877 --> 49:05.516
and it was very sincere.

49:05.517 --> 49:08.916
You're a lovely person, I think you
did a great job. Well done.

49:08.917 --> 49:10.917
(CHEERING)

49:12.717 --> 49:18.036
Like Simon, this musical,
this movie had a massive impact

49:18.037 --> 49:20.796
on me and my kids
and the family and everything.

49:20.797 --> 49:25.756
You have an incredible voice,
but it left me cold

49:25.757 --> 49:30.036
and... (BOOING)

49:30.037 --> 49:32.116
..and I don't know why.

49:32.117 --> 49:34.836
It just didn't have the kind of...

49:34.837 --> 49:37.036
You know, when I hear that song,

49:37.037 --> 49:39.116
it makes me think
I can conquer the world.

49:39.117 --> 49:41.236
(BOOING)

49:41.237 --> 49:43.277
I'm so sorry.

49:44.477 --> 49:48.236
Er, I agree with Amanda.

49:48.237 --> 49:50.237
(BOOING)

49:51.957 --> 49:55.956
You know what? I love the song,
you know I love this movie,

49:55.957 --> 49:57.596
but I've got to tell you,

49:57.597 --> 50:00.756
there was something, for me, it was
very sanitised.

50:00.757 --> 50:04.676
Like you said, it was very cold.
I just didn't believe it.

50:04.677 --> 50:06.316
(BOOING)

50:06.317 --> 50:11.236
It just... It is such a special
song,

50:11.237 --> 50:13.756
and for whatever reason, it was
stiff,

50:13.757 --> 50:17.756
everything about it felt...
I can't explain it.

50:17.757 --> 50:20.796
It was like everyone had done this
for you, but it wasn't you.

50:20.797 --> 50:22.516
(BOOING)

50:22.517 --> 50:25.276
Listen to what the audience thought
of it!

50:25.277 --> 50:27.316

They loved it.

50:27.317 --> 50:30.196
I think they're gonna vote for you
tonight. Well done.

50:30.197 --> 50:32.276
Thank you, David.
Thank you very much.

50:32.277 --> 50:34.316
The audience are speaking.

50:34.317 --> 50:37.556
If Ronan's your choice for the
final, the details are onscreen,

who've already
performed this evening.

51:12.691 --> 51:15.010
Great job, everybody. Well done.

51:15.011 --> 51:18.050
But next up: their audition
portrayed a nightmare

51:18.051 --> 51:20.290
where one man was recreated as a
witch,

51:20.291 --> 51:23.130
thrown into a revolving cage
and attacked by demons.

51:23.131 --> 51:25.210
It was basically
fun for all the family (!)

51:55.531 --> 51:57.171
I'm afraid of the dark...

51:58.651 --> 52:02.331
..but there is something so exciting
about the unknown.

52:03.571 --> 52:06.571
The feeling of not knowing your
surroundings is scary...

52:09.211 --> 52:11.011
..yet magical.

52:12.651 --> 52:16.890
When a person is scared,
their heart beats quicker,

52:16.891 --> 52:21.731
their breathing becomes faster
and their senses are heightened.

52:23.491 --> 52:26.571
This is how we want you to feel
tonight.

52:30.091 --> 52:32.530

attention

If you wanna be in with a chance of
winning something for yourself,

58:35.931 --> 58:37.570
have a look at this...

58:37.571 --> 58:41.250
It's another chance for you at home
to win a life-changing Â£100,000

58:41.251 --> 58:43.090
from the comfort of your living room.

58:43.091 --> 58:45.810
It's the biggest cash prize we've
ever given away.

58:45.811 --> 58:49.130
The best bit is, you don't even
need a talent to win it.

58:49.131 --> 58:51.210
All this lot did was pick up the
phone.

58:51.211 --> 58:54.810
You could be just like them:
really lucky and a lot richer.

58:54.811 --> 58:57.130
I couldn't believe it, you know.
Over the moon.

58:57.131 --> 59:01.451
Real people do win, yeah. For your
chance to win Â£100,000...

59:24.851 --> 59:26.451
Good luck.

59:32.584 --> 59:35.663
Welcome back to another quiet night
here at Britain's Got Talent,

59:35.664 --> 59:38.343
where it's time for our last
performance of the evening.

59:38.344 --> 59:41.183
It's David's Golden Buzzer act:
Donchez Dacres.

59:41.184 --> 59:42.823
(CHEERING)

59:42.824 --> 59:46.183
My name is Donchez and I'm from
Wolverhampton.

59:46.184 --> 59:50.143
I'm 61 years young. Switch!
(CHUCKLES)

59:50.144 --> 59:52.263
I work for the AA.

59:52.264 --> 59:54.903
I've been doing this job 29 years.

59:54.904 --> 59:59.743
When I fix that car and I see this
smile, I am just living on that.

59:59.744 --> 01:00:01.983
# Wiggle and wine your body

01:00:01.984 --> 01:00:04.623
# Wiggle and wine
and you look pretty... #

01:00:04.624 --> 01:00:08.023
At the first audition, oh, man,
it was amazing.

01:00:08.024 --> 01:00:10.583
It was beautiful. (CHEERING)

01:00:10.584 --> 01:00:14.183
I cannot believe I had this Golden
Buzzer.

01:00:14.184 --> 01:00:17.263
Big up Britain's Got Talent, that's
all I'm gonna say.

01:00:17.264 --> 01:00:21.424
Everywhere I go since, I have been
teaching people how to do the wiggle.

01:00:22.464 --> 01:00:26.423
You've got to get the wine going on
first and then you get the wiggle.

01:00:26.424 --> 01:00:28.943
Once you get the two together,
you're away.

01:00:28.944 --> 01:00:30.623
Here we go, wiggle wine.

01:00:30.624 --> 01:00:33.663
# I like to move it, move it,
I like to move it...

01:00:33.664 --> 01:00:36.463
I want the wiggle wine to be the
next big thing

01:00:36.464 --> 01:00:38.303
that's gonna take the world.

01:00:38.304 --> 01:00:42.743
Shrewsbury, Telford, Wolverhampton,
Droitwich, Birmingham...

01:00:42.744 --> 01:00:44.783
(CHUCKLES)

01:00:44.784 --> 01:00:48.503
Tonight, I am gonna go out on that
stage and drop it like it's hot.

01:00:48.504 --> 01:00:52.303
You know, I'm going to unleash the
beast. I am ready to go.

01:00:52.304 --> 01:00:54.343
# Nice and sweet and sexy

01:00:54.344 --> 01:00:56.823
Switch! (GIGGLES)

01:00:56.824 --> 01:00:58.824

01:01:00.024 --> 01:01:02.063
(DANCE MUSIC)

01:01:02.064 --> 01:01:04.543
Come on everybody, it's me again.

01:01:04.544 --> 01:01:06.783
Time to wiggle wine. Let's go!

01:01:06.784 --> 01:01:09.624
All the sexy ladies,

01:01:11.144 --> 01:01:13.583
# Pretty gal,

# Wine up your body, gal,

01:01:36.544 --> 01:01:39.423
# Wiggle up your hips them
and take it to the sky

01:01:39.424 --> 01:01:42.424
# The music sweet,
like the food that you eat

01:01:45.064 --> 01:01:47.823
# You look good, feel good,
it's your state of mind

01:01:47.824 --> 01:01:50.503
# Show off your body, gal,
you know you look fine

01:01:50.504 --> 01:01:53.663
# Sweet soul music
for cleansing you soul

01:01:53.664 --> 01:01:55.943
# Your body is your temple,
you'll never grow old

01:01:55.944 --> 01:01:58.143
# Pretty gal
# Wiggle and wine your body

01:01:58.144 --> 01:02:00.943

# Wine up your body,

# Wine up your body, gal,

01:02:15.704 --> 01:02:18.903

01:03:15.784 --> 01:03:17.584
(WHISTLING)

01:03:18.584 --> 01:03:21.583
(GIGGLES) Now, David,
your Golden Buzzer...

01:03:21.584 --> 01:03:24.383
Oh, Donchez!

01:03:24.384 --> 01:03:27.383
You have done me so proud tonight.

01:03:27.384 --> 01:03:30.423
My goodness,
we needed that tonight.

01:03:30.424 --> 01:03:33.544
We needed something that joyous and
magical.

01:03:34.624 --> 01:03:36.663
We need it as a nation.

01:03:36.664 --> 01:03:39.503
I think people at home
are going to pick up their phones

01:03:39.504 --> 01:03:41.183
and vote for you.

01:03:41.184 --> 01:03:44.703
And fingers crossed, we're gonna
see you in the final on Sunday!

01:03:44.704 --> 01:03:46.704
(CHEERING)

01:03:49.064 --> 01:03:52.343
I love you. You brought that
island vibe again tonight,

01:03:52.344 --> 01:03:54.383
the party vibe, the carnival vibe.

01:03:54.384 --> 01:03:56.583
I think you're in with a real
chance.

01:03:56.584 --> 01:03:58.423
I hope people put you through.

01:03:58.424 --> 01:04:01.024
I love you. (CHEERING) Well done.
Thank you.

01:04:02.064 --> 01:04:05.303
Everyt'ing irie, baby.
Everyt'ing irie!

01:04:05.304 --> 01:04:07.304
(CHEERING)

01:04:08.504 --> 01:04:10.143
Everything's sweet.

01:04:10.144 --> 01:04:12.023
Everyt'ing's sweet.

01:04:12.024 --> 01:04:15.503
It's been one of the nuttiest nights
I've ever had in my life.

01:04:15.504 --> 01:04:18.383
Literally everything from start to
finish.

01:04:18.384 --> 01:04:21.023
You put it in the mix.
We've had zombies,

01:04:21.024 --> 01:04:24.383
we've had magicians, we've had
people pressing our buzzers

01:04:24.384 --> 01:04:26.223
and now you.

01:04:26.224 --> 01:04:28.943
It's like, wow! But you know what?
This was amazing.

01:04:28.944 --> 01:04:30.983
I really like you.
(CHEERING)

01:04:30.984 --> 01:04:33.023
Thank you, Simon.

01:04:33.024 --> 01:04:34.863
You know how you are.

01:04:34.864 --> 01:04:37.303
It's fun, it's infectious.

01:04:37.304 --> 01:04:40.663
Look, if you make it to the final -
and there's a chance that you will -

01:04:40.664 --> 01:04:43.503
you're gonna do something else next
time though, right?

01:04:43.504 --> 01:04:46.063
(CHEERING) Most definitely, Simon.

01:04:46.064 --> 01:04:49.263
Wiggling and wining... We've got to
have something new.

01:04:49.264 --> 01:04:53.183
Definitely because everybody
embrace Wiggle Wine so much.

01:04:53.184 --> 01:04:55.423
Really? I decided to...
(CHEERING)

01:04:55.424 --> 01:04:57.503

01:06:11.584 --> 01:06:13.584
and how you can support them.

01:06:15.104 --> 01:06:17.623
# Oh, oh, oh, oh

01:06:17.624 --> 01:06:20.023
# Oh, oh, oh, oh

01:06:20.024 --> 01:06:24.303
# Oh, oh, oh, oh

# Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh

01:06:26.344 --> 01:06:28.383
# Oh-oh-oh

01:06:28.384 --> 01:06:30.503
# This is me #

01:06:30.504 --> 01:06:32.664
(CHEERING)

01:06:35.944 --> 01:06:39.303
# Taste of your lips I'm on a ride

01:06:39.304 --> 01:06:42.583
# You're toxic, I'm slipping under

01:06:42.584 --> 01:06:45.383
# With a taste of a poison paradise

01:06:45.384 --> 01:06:47.103
# I'm addicted to you

01:06:47.104 --> 01:06:49.663
# Don't you know
that you're toxic? #

01:06:49.664 --> 01:06:53.263
# Isn't she lovely?

01:06:53.264 --> 01:06:58.023
# Isn't she wonderful?

01:06:58.024 --> 01:07:02.183
# Isn't she precious?

01:07:02.184 --> 01:07:06.224
# Such a beautiful girl #

01:07:07.224 --> 01:07:09.783
(AS DONALD TRUMP) Why would such a
beautiful nation

01:07:09.784 --> 01:07:12.703
want to join forces with a
big-headed megalomaniac

01:07:12.704 --> 01:07:17.064
with far too much money, terrible
hair and a weird voice?

01:07:18.944 --> 01:07:22.503
But if America wants to work with
Simon Cowell, that's no problem.

01:07:22.504 --> 01:07:24.223
(LAUGHTER)

01:07:24.224 --> 01:07:27.703
Always buy engagement rings bigger
than you reckon you need 'em.

01:07:27.704 --> 01:07:29.343
(LAUGHTER)

01:07:29.344 --> 01:07:31.703
That way, when you apply it,
you can go,

01:07:31.704 --> 01:07:35.023
"Ooh, you've lost weight", which
always gets you Brownie points.

01:07:35.024 --> 01:07:38.623
More importantly, it means you can
get it back without waking 'em up.

01:07:38.624 --> 01:07:40.624
(LAUGHTER)

01:07:42.024 --> 01:07:45.263
# Never be enough

night, like I say.

01:08:40.064 --> 01:08:41.703
That's it from us for now.

01:08:41.703 --> 01:08:44.943
Stay tuned for Corrie, to find out
what happens to Pat Phelan

01:08:44.944 --> 01:08:49.303
in the butchers' yard and - spoiler
alert - he's not mixing cement.

01:08:49.304 --> 01:08:51.783
We'll be back at 9:30 with the
results,

01:08:51.783 --> 01:08:54.542
when two more acts will win a place
in the final.

01:08:54.544 --> 01:08:58.063
Plus we've got a very special
live performance from Alfie Boe.

01:08:58.064 --> 01:09:02.063

half an hour. Don't be late!
