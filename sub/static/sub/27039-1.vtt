00:13.833 --> 00:17.567
(Screaming)

00:21.667 --> 00:25.667
Please.

00:25.667 --> 00:29.700
(Screaming)

00:33.767 --> 00:37.800
No!

00:37.800 --> 00:41.700
(Metal music)

00:50.033 --> 00:53.833
(Metal music)

01:01.867 --> 01:05.867
(Metal music)

01:13.867 --> 01:17.867
(Metal music)

01:21.867 --> 01:24.200
Oh thank you.

01:24.200 --> 01:26.333
What are you working on?

01:26.333 --> 01:30.333
A crime watch story. Community
stuff.

01:30.333 --> 01:34.367
These people got together and
exposed a child molester that
was living on their street.

01:34.367 --> 01:38.833
He was getting a little too
friendly with some of the kids
in the neighborhood.

01:38.833 --> 01:42.633
So they're trying to get all
the communities together to
form this perv watch.

01:42.633 --> 01:44.833
Perv watch? Is that what you're
going to call it?

01:44.833 --> 01:46.667
Well, that's what I'm calling
it,

01:46.667 --> 01:50.967
but that's not what I'm calling
it in the article.

01:50.967 --> 01:55.100
Hey, covering perverts is
better than covering high
school right? I guess.

01:55.100 --> 01:59.067
What do you want for dinner tonight?
Whatever.

01:59.067 --> 02:03.433
Something that is not too mess.
Probably going to eat it right
here.

02:03.433 --> 02:05.367
I got to get this story
finished by midnight honey.

02:05.367 --> 02:07.700
I'll figure something out.

02:07.700 --> 02:11.833
(Ringing)

02:11.833 --> 02:15.767
Hello. Are you serious?

02:15.767 --> 02:20.100
OK.

02:20.100 --> 02:24.267
Alright, I'll be there. OK, not
a problem.

02:24.267 --> 02:28.233
Thanks for calling. Alright.

02:28.233 --> 02:32.233
OK. Bye.
What's that about?

02:32.233 --> 02:36.600
My grandmother died.

02:36.600 --> 02:40.600
Oh honey, I'm so sorry.
Don't be. She was a wicked
woman.

02:40.600 --> 02:45.067
She used to beat the shit out
of me.

02:45.067 --> 02:49.133
Now my fat aunt Carol just
guilted me into going to the
after funeral party.

02:49.133 --> 02:53.200
Funeral party? What the hell is that?
I guess it's a party after the
funeral.

02:53.200 --> 02:57.200
I don't know. They're all
having a get together.

02:57.200 --> 02:59.233
I'm just not looking forward to it.
When is it?

02:59.233 --> 03:01.233
Saturday.
What me to go with you?

03:01.233 --> 03:03.333
Nah, there is no need for both
of us to suffer.

03:03.333 --> 03:05.467
Why don't you just hang out
here at the house,

03:05.467 --> 03:09.467
or go out with your friends?
I'll go and make a showing.

03:09.467 --> 03:11.467
I'll eat and then I'll jet out
of there.

03:11.467 --> 03:15.500
I don't want to hang out with
those assholes all day.

03:19.567 --> 03:23.600
(Ripping)

03:27.600 --> 03:31.633
(Intense music)

03:31.633 --> 03:35.700
Why Lynn? Why what?

03:35.700 --> 03:37.733
Why did you spend 2000 dollars
last month on the fucking Visa?

03:37.733 --> 03:39.767
Maybe because you don't make
enough Scott. Maybe that's the
reason.

03:39.767 --> 03:43.800
They're going to take this
house right out from under us.
Do you understand that?

03:43.800 --> 03:45.833
You just need to get another
job.

03:45.833 --> 03:47.833
No, you will have to get a job.

03:47.833 --> 03:51.900
I'm sick and tired of being the
only breadwinner in this house,

03:51.900 --> 03:53.933
and I'm sick of asking my mom
and Rod for money because you
can't stop spending.

03:53.933 --> 03:56.067
I'm cutting you off. Right now.

03:56.067 --> 04:00.167
You are not cutting me off bub.
Not at all. Do you understand
me?

04:00.167 --> 04:04.167
I said do you understand me?
(Slap)

04:04.167 --> 04:08.367
You keep mouthing off like
that,

04:08.367 --> 04:09.767
we can have two funerals this
week.

04:11.967 --> 04:13.400
Understand me whore? You are
not going to ruin me. Do you
understand that?

04:14.833 --> 04:16.733
I said do you understand that?

04:16.733 --> 04:20.733
Yes. Please Scott. I'm sorry.

04:20.733 --> 04:22.933
Yeah, you're the sorriest piece
of shit I've ever seen.

04:22.933 --> 04:27.067
You make me sick. Get out of my
face.

04:27.067 --> 04:30.800
(TV noise)

04:35.067 --> 04:39.200
(TV noise)

04:43.433 --> 04:47.400
Do you have any plans today?
How's that any of your business?

04:47.400 --> 04:51.700
Are you and your dad going out
today?

04:51.700 --> 04:55.867
We only go out Mona when we get
called. There are no houses to
gut.

04:55.867 --> 04:59.900
I talked to my boss. We are
looking for a third shift
cashier.

04:59.900 --> 05:04.067
I'm not working in some donut
shop woman. I'm not doing that!

05:04.067 --> 05:06.267
I really think it will be good
for you and us to bring in some
income.

05:06.267 --> 05:08.367
You haven't done anything in
months. That's it!

05:08.367 --> 05:12.500
I'm not taking this verbal
abuse. No way. No how!

05:12.500 --> 05:16.467
(Slam) Hey dad.

05:16.467 --> 05:20.833
Hay is for horses. What the
hell do you want?

05:20.833 --> 05:24.867
I need to borrow 20 dollars. I
met this guy and I want to get
my hair done.

05:24.867 --> 05:26.967
Oh how wonderful.

05:26.967 --> 05:29.067
Wonderful my fat ass.

05:29.067 --> 05:31.133
Where did you meet this great
guy anyhow?

05:31.133 --> 05:33.233
Show him your titties at some
bar?

05:33.233 --> 05:35.333
No, I met him online and
there's nothing wrong with that.

05:35.333 --> 05:37.433
There's nothing wrong with
that? Did you hear that Mona?

05:37.433 --> 05:41.600
She said there's nothing wrong
with meeting some guy online.

05:41.600 --> 05:43.500
Don't you know that there are
predators out there

05:43.500 --> 05:45.800
that want to rip you from mouth
to asshole

05:45.800 --> 05:49.833
spill your guts on the floor
and then face fuck your skull?

05:49.833 --> 05:51.833
They enjoy it.

05:51.833 --> 05:53.100
You're totally overreacting
dad.

05:53.100 --> 05:54.667
So what's his name?

05:54.667 --> 05:57.900
Tyrone. Tyrone?

05:57.900 --> 06:01.933
That sounds like a god damn
darkie. Y

06:01.933 --> 06:05.933
You spread your legs for one of
those dirtbags, I will kill you.

06:05.933 --> 06:09.967
I will fucking kill both of
you.

06:09.967 --> 06:13.833
(Eerie music)

06:13.833 --> 06:18.267
No.

06:18.267 --> 06:22.267
No.

06:22.267 --> 06:26.533
(Gasp)
What's the matter?

06:26.533 --> 06:30.533
Just had a nightmare. I'll say.
You jumped halfway across the
room.

06:30.533 --> 06:34.567
What were you dreaming about,
pole vaulting?

06:34.567 --> 06:38.433
Very funny. No, I was dreaming
about my grandmother.

06:38.433 --> 06:40.467
Why are you so afraid of her?

06:40.467 --> 06:42.500
I told you. She was a wicked
woman.

06:42.500 --> 06:44.600
Yeah, that's all you told me.
Tell me the rest.

06:44.600 --> 06:46.900
Why does she bother you like
this?

06:46.900 --> 06:51.133
Well, she did more than beat
me.

06:51.133 --> 06:52.933
She used to torment me daily.

06:52.933 --> 06:59.167
When I was a kid, like eight
years old, I had this dog named
skipper.

06:59.167 --> 07:03.167
I loved that dog to death.

07:03.167 --> 07:07.200
One day she comes walking in my
room with that little Scottish
terrier under her arm.

07:07.200 --> 07:11.200
She breaks his neck. She kills
him right in front of me.

07:11.200 --> 07:15.567
Her laughter boomed in my ears,

07:15.567 --> 07:17.667
as I cried and cried.

07:17.667 --> 07:19.733
My god.

07:19.733 --> 07:21.633
When I was younger, the cops
were looking for an old lady

07:21.633 --> 07:23.733
that had killed some kids in my
neighborhood.

07:23.733 --> 07:28.067
They never found her. I know it
was my nana.

07:28.067 --> 07:30.067
I would bet the fucking house
on it.

07:30.067 --> 07:32.067
I can see why you have these
nightmares.

07:32.067 --> 07:36.100
Yeah, but this one is
different.

07:36.100 --> 07:40.100
This one was real. It was like
she was trying to contact me
through my dream.

07:40.100 --> 07:43.933
You watch way too many horror
movies.

07:43.933 --> 07:47.967
Just shut off the light, go to
bed and forget about the bitch.

07:47.967 --> 07:52.167
You have nothing to worry
about. You can't come back from
the dead.

07:52.167 --> 07:56.200
You're a church girl babe. You
believe in demons.

07:56.200 --> 07:58.200
What if my nana was a demon?

07:58.200 --> 08:00.267
I've seen pictures of your
nana,

08:00.267 --> 08:02.067
and even a demon couldn't be
that ugly.

08:02.067 --> 08:04.067
Yeah, you got a point.

08:04.067 --> 08:08.100
(Click)

08:08.100 --> 08:12.133
Hey, get that away from me.

08:12.133 --> 08:14.133
Come on babe. I'm awake now.

08:14.133 --> 08:16.367
You're scaring me.

08:16.367 --> 08:20.400
You think of your nana and then
you want to have sex?

08:20.400 --> 08:24.233
Come on fuck me nana! Fuck me
nana. Come on. Fuck me nana.

08:24.233 --> 08:28.433
Hey Geno. Hey Wayne.

08:28.433 --> 08:32.299
You're looking lovely today.
Thank you.

08:32.299 --> 08:36.700
Give me that wrench Scott.

08:36.700 --> 08:40.700
Hey Rod.

08:40.700 --> 08:44.900
I hate to ask you this.

08:44.900 --> 08:48.733
If it's about money. This
fucking funeral has wiped me
out completely.

08:48.733 --> 08:52.933
It's not about that. It's about
your first marriage.

08:52.933 --> 08:54.967
Before you met my mother.

08:54.967 --> 08:56.767
Yeah? What about it?

08:56.767 --> 09:01.067
I think I'm going to divorce
Lynn. I can't take it anymore.

09:01.067 --> 09:03.067
Whatever I make at the plant,
she spends.

09:03.067 --> 09:05.067
I work more hours, she spends
more money.

09:05.067 --> 09:09.233
I can't ahead. Stay fucking
married.

09:09.233 --> 09:11.267
These cunts can rob your blind
when you're with them.

09:11.267 --> 09:13.300
When you're away from them?

09:13.300 --> 09:15.300
God damn, they'll rip your
fucking balls off.

09:15.300 --> 09:17.100
You got a young one too. What
is he, 3 years old?

09:17.100 --> 09:21.167
Stay married. Open up a secret
account and throw some money in
there.

09:21.167 --> 09:23.467
Do you have a secret account?

09:23.467 --> 09:25.533
I have a lot of secrets but
we're not talking about me now.

09:25.533 --> 09:29.733
Stay fucking married. Put some
money in a secret account.

09:29.733 --> 09:31.767
Wait it out until the boy is 18
and then ditch the bitch.

09:31.767 --> 09:33.600
If she won't go, persuade her.

09:33.600 --> 09:37.633
How do you do that? There are
ways my boy.

09:37.633 --> 09:41.833
You don't hear a word from my
ex now do you?

09:41.833 --> 09:45.667
(Eerie music)

09:53.967 --> 09:58.067
(Eerie music)

09:58.067 --> 10:02.200
What's up with the get up
Nelson?

10:02.200 --> 10:04.267
Did you want to look like a
complete asshole?

10:04.267 --> 10:06.100
If I wanted to look like an
asshole, Rod,

10:06.100 --> 10:10.333
I would have raided your closet
this morning. You punk ass
bitch.

10:10.333 --> 10:12.167
How dare you say that to me.
How dare you! How dare you!

10:12.167 --> 10:14.433
Calm down Rod.

10:14.433 --> 10:18.333
Nelson what sort of statement
are you trying to make with
that ridiculous suit and top
hat?

10:18.333 --> 10:22.567
Carol, you have no room to
criticize,

10:22.567 --> 10:24.400
and I don't think I'm being
disrespectful. This is my suit.

10:24.400 --> 10:26.433
Personally, I think he looks
good.

10:26.433 --> 10:28.667
This is a funeral. We should
not be arguing.

10:28.667 --> 10:30.700
Let's just mourn the loss,

10:30.700 --> 10:34.633
and forget about what everyone
else is wearing. OK?

10:34.633 --> 10:38.867
Oh shut up. Who's talking to
you anyway you dike?

10:38.867 --> 10:40.900
Nelson, you're out of line.

10:40.900 --> 10:42.733
If you're trying to make a
statement this is the wrong
time to do it.

10:51.100 --> 10:53.167
Can you believe the nerve of
that pig?

10:53.167 --> 10:55.233
I told you not to wear that.

10:55.233 --> 10:59.033
How the fuck was I supposed to
know that my suit was going to
give Rod such a fucking hard on?

10:59.033 --> 11:01.067
Jesus christ.

11:01.067 --> 11:03.300
Hey stranger.

11:03.300 --> 11:07.367
What are you doing hiding out
over here?

11:07.367 --> 11:11.233
Just hiding from that crazy
family of ours. So, how you
doing?

11:11.233 --> 11:15.333
Good. I visited dad yesterday.

11:15.333 --> 11:17.400
Oh Jesus christ, why'd you do
that?

11:17.400 --> 11:19.667
He's still our father Geno.

11:19.667 --> 11:23.733
No matter what he's done, he'll
always be our father.

11:23.733 --> 11:25.533
Anyways, he's old and harmless.

11:25.533 --> 11:27.767
Yeah, you need to give Mr. M
some slack.

11:27.767 --> 11:29.800
He's a very nice guy.

11:29.800 --> 11:31.867
Then why don't you marry him?

11:31.867 --> 11:35.900
You would be perfect for each
other. I think my father likes
men in leather.

11:35.900 --> 11:39.933
I ain't no fag. Relax honey.

11:39.933 --> 11:41.833
Look, can we please not argue.

11:41.833 --> 11:44.100
I hate that we fight all the
time. So, what else is up?

11:44.100 --> 11:48.100
Well, I got a promotion. I'm
now the team leader.

11:48.100 --> 11:50.200
It's great for me.

11:50.200 --> 11:52.300
Congratulations.

11:52.300 --> 11:54.567
So, can I ask you a question?

11:54.567 --> 11:56.467
Sure.

11:56.467 --> 11:58.700
Have you been having any
strange dreams lately?

11:58.700 --> 12:00.800
No.

12:00.800 --> 12:04.900
Why? I've been having these
horrific nightmares about Nana.

12:04.900 --> 12:07.067
They seem so real.

12:07.067 --> 12:09.100
It's because you miss her.

12:09.100 --> 12:11.200
You may not think that you miss
her but you do.

12:11.200 --> 12:13.267
It's your subconscious telling
you the truth.

12:13.267 --> 12:15.133
You love her and you miss here.

12:15.133 --> 12:17.433
Where can I get a beer?

12:17.433 --> 12:21.267
Boy, it's just not a party
unless you're getting wasted,
is it Sam?

12:21.267 --> 12:25.700
I'm getting sick of your mouth.

12:25.700 --> 12:29.533
Claire, I gotta go. He's the
reason we don't talk anymore.

12:29.533 --> 12:33.800
You lose that dead weight,
we'll be friends again.

12:33.800 --> 12:37.833
Mom.

12:37.833 --> 12:41.967
Get out of here.

12:41.967 --> 12:46.100
You know how your father is.

12:46.100 --> 12:50.067
Sarah! What are you doing?

12:50.067 --> 12:52.333
I told you I didn't want you
spreading your legs for any
fucking monkey.

12:52.333 --> 12:54.467
Who the hell do you think you
are?

12:54.467 --> 12:56.267
I'm her god damn father that's
who the hell I am.

12:56.267 --> 12:58.467
You need to calm down.

12:58.467 --> 13:02.267
You bring this to your
grandmother's funeral?

13:02.267 --> 13:06.467
She must be spinning in your
grave to know your spreading
your legs for an animal!

13:06.467 --> 13:10.500
Animal? What? I'll beat your
fat ass up.

13:10.500 --> 13:12.333
Yeah, you people settle
everything with violence huh?

13:12.333 --> 13:14.567
You're like a pack of wolves.

13:14.567 --> 13:16.600
When you're together, but by
yourself you're not worth a
shit.

13:16.600 --> 13:18.633
I'm not afraid of you!

13:18.633 --> 13:22.533
Suck my dick mother fucker.
I'll kill you both.

13:22.533 --> 13:26.733
Remember what I said Sarah!
I'll kill you both!

13:26.733 --> 13:30.767
I saw a new dress today. It was
only a hundred dollars.

13:30.767 --> 13:34.667
And I saw a job posting today.
No skills required. Perfect for
you.

13:34.667 --> 13:36.867
You need to relax Scott. You're
too tense.

13:36.867 --> 13:38.900
Why don't you go mingle.

13:38.900 --> 13:42.900
I don't know your family. Get
lost!

13:47.133 --> 13:51.200
Hey Scott, long time no see.

13:51.200 --> 13:53.400
You could say that.

13:53.400 --> 13:55.400
I just did. What's it been?
Like ten years?

13:55.400 --> 13:59.400
I don't really keep track of
the time. What's up?

13:59.400 --> 14:03.667
Nothing. Isn't it strange how a
family can so separated by time

14:03.667 --> 14:07.667
and then brought back together
when one of their own drops?

14:07.667 --> 14:11.533
There are people here I haven't
seen in ages. This is something
else.

14:11.533 --> 14:13.767
Death can bring people
together. That's for sure.

14:13.767 --> 14:15.800
I think most of the people are
here for the free meal.

14:15.800 --> 14:19.867
So, what are you doing for work?

14:19.867 --> 14:24.067
Working at the newspaper.
Writing articles about this and
that.

14:24.067 --> 14:28.100
Nothing major. Still doing that
crap? Crap?

14:28.100 --> 14:32.300
I mean, I'd rather be working
at a magazine, but I'll take
what I can get.

14:32.300 --> 14:34.400
You still working at the meat
factory?

14:34.400 --> 14:36.267
Yeah, still a slave to the
grind.

14:36.267 --> 14:38.533
Fucking bastards.

14:38.533 --> 14:41.367
Hey, remember when we were ten
years old,

14:41.367 --> 14:44.633
and we had the super soaker
water guns and we filled them
up with disappearing ink?

14:44.633 --> 14:48.833
We shot up all Nana's clothing
that was hanging out on the
line.

14:48.833 --> 14:50.900
Not really. No.

14:50.900 --> 14:52.933
Come on. You remember! It sat
out in the sun for a few hours.

14:52.933 --> 14:55.067
That purple ink dried in. Oh
man.

14:55.067 --> 14:57.200
She chased us with a bread
knife.

14:57.200 --> 15:01.300
We hid in the bushes. It was
hysterical.

15:01.300 --> 15:03.367
Is that what you do? Live in
the past?

15:03.367 --> 15:05.433
No. No.

15:05.433 --> 15:07.333
I just thought you might want
to talk about old times.

15:07.333 --> 15:09.600
I didn't realize you were so
miserable.

15:13.833 --> 15:17.633
My dad is so crazy right?

15:17.633 --> 15:19.633
Yeah, but I'm used to dealing
with people like that.

15:19.633 --> 15:21.633
I'm sure if he gave me a
chance, he'd probably like me.

15:21.633 --> 15:23.633
He's just so full of hate right
now.

15:23.633 --> 15:27.933
He can't even see anything
else. Listen. Forget that.

15:27.933 --> 15:32.067
Twin Obsession. Coming to
Foxwoods next Friday. I got us
the tickets.

15:32.067 --> 15:34.067
You want to go?

15:34.067 --> 15:35.867
I would love to go.

15:35.867 --> 15:39.967
I love Steven Joseph Adams.
That lead singer. He's such a
hottie.

15:39.967 --> 15:44.267
Should I be worried? I'm just
happy I could do that for you.

15:44.267 --> 15:48.367
I checked out their CD. It's
alright for a boy band.

15:48.367 --> 15:52.233
They are not a boy band. They
look like sissies to me.

15:52.233 --> 15:56.267
They are not a bunch of
sissies, but I want to thank
you for getting me the tickets.

15:56.267 --> 15:58.267
I'm glad I could do it for you.

15:58.267 --> 16:02.733
So, you want to go have some
fun?

16:02.733 --> 16:06.667
(Laughter)

16:10.967 --> 16:14.833
Hey, it's the Vershons. Good to
see you.

16:14.833 --> 16:19.067
Geno, read your article on that
pervert. Good job!

16:19.067 --> 16:23.233
I guess I just have flare when
it comes to writing about
perverts.

16:23.233 --> 16:25.233
Nelson, I don't believe I met
your girlfriend.

16:25.233 --> 16:27.267
Geno this is Cindy. Nice to
meet you.

16:27.267 --> 16:31.100
Likewise. So, does anyone know
what crawled up Scott's ass?

16:31.100 --> 16:33.200
Either he's having a bad day or
he's become the world's biggest
douche bag.

16:33.200 --> 16:35.267
He's a douche bag.

16:35.267 --> 16:39.467
He's going through a lot right
now with his wife and working a
lot of hours.

16:39.467 --> 16:43.367
Crazy hours. It's really taking
a toll on him.

16:43.367 --> 16:47.600
He looks like he's about fifty
years old.

16:47.600 --> 16:49.833
Hello people. I hope you're
having a good time.

16:49.833 --> 16:51.867
Hey, funerals always cheer me
up.

16:51.867 --> 16:56.067
Very funny. Hold my spot for me?

16:56.067 --> 16:58.100
I'll be here. You sure now?

16:58.100 --> 17:00.067
I'm not going anywhere. Promise?

17:00.067 --> 17:04.333
I promise.

17:08.532 --> 17:12.567
(Eerie music)

17:20.700 --> 17:24.767
(Slicing sound) Tyrone?

17:32.933 --> 17:36.733
(Eerie music)

17:44.867 --> 17:48.933
Tyrone.

17:53.067 --> 17:57.300
Nana?

17:57.300 --> 18:01.200
(Scream) Hey Geno, how's it
going?

18:01.200 --> 18:05.200
Good, how are you? Great. So,
when are you going to show me
the ropes?

18:05.200 --> 18:09.200
Go talk to Carmichael. I'm sure
he'll let you tag along on my
next exciting interview.

18:09.200 --> 18:11.233
Exciting? Like what?

18:11.233 --> 18:13.267
Oh I'm just being sarcastic.

18:13.267 --> 18:17.533
One thing you gotta learn about
journalism is it's 99 percent
boring.

18:17.533 --> 18:21.433
Just like any other job. I'll
catch up with you in five or so
years,

18:21.433 --> 18:23.700
and you'll be just as
disgruntled as I am.

18:23.700 --> 18:25.733
Come on.

18:25.733 --> 18:27.600
You're out in the world getting
the story out. You're a
valuable guy.

18:27.600 --> 18:29.667
I'm glad someone thinks so. I
do.

18:29.667 --> 18:33.700
What the hell are you doing
over here Britney?

18:33.700 --> 18:35.967
I asked her to come over here
Carmichael.

18:35.967 --> 18:37.800
Really? Didn't I assign you to
anything?

18:37.800 --> 18:39.867
No sir. I was actually talking
to Geno about that.

18:39.867 --> 18:41.933
I would really like to cover
something for the paper.

18:41.933 --> 18:46.233
Oh alright. Why don't you cover
me a coffee and a couple donuts?

18:46.233 --> 18:50.267
Fat pig. I'll shove a cruller
up his ass.

18:50.267 --> 18:54.100
Bad day? No Geno. A good day. A
very good day.

18:54.100 --> 18:58.367
I got a hot one for you. They
just found two dead bodies out
there in the woods

18:58.367 --> 19:00.467
by the meat plant. I want you
to cover it.

19:00.467 --> 19:01.833
Oh my god. Did they release the
names?

19:01.833 --> 19:04.067
We don't know shit.

19:04.067 --> 19:06.300
That's why I'm sending you. Go
over there scoop. Get the story.

19:06.300 --> 19:10.633
Get it back to me ASAP. Come on
man.

19:10.633 --> 19:12.433
Hello Mr. Carmichael. How are
you doing today?

19:12.433 --> 19:14.467
Shut the fuck up and take off

19:14.467 --> 19:18.733
that ridiculous hat. You look
like an asshole!

19:22.767 --> 19:26.933
So, I see Carmichael yet
another good story while I get
to sit over there

19:26.933 --> 19:28.767
and cover the Ludlow High
football team.

19:28.767 --> 19:30.967
Geibner, I don't have time for
this right now.

19:30.967 --> 19:34.800
Of course you don't. You're too
busy getting all the great
assignments,

19:34.800 --> 19:37.067
and playing hide the salami
with the interns.

19:37.067 --> 19:39.067
You know, kissing ass is one
thing McGee,

19:39.067 --> 19:43.067
and you do it really well but
you're basically sucking
Gerald's cock right here.

19:43.067 --> 19:47.067
If you have a problem, you take
it up with Carmichael. I gotta
go.

19:47.067 --> 19:51.267
(Bass music)

19:59.567 --> 20:03.600
You thought you were really
cute, right Geno?

20:03.600 --> 20:07.733
Running that piece on me? You
ruined my life!

20:07.733 --> 20:11.567
You're a peeping Tom Carlos.
You were looking at a 13 year
old girl.

20:11.567 --> 20:15.833
I think people have the right
to know.

20:15.833 --> 20:19.667
You ruined my fucking life.
What gives you the right?
You're not god!

20:19.667 --> 20:24.033
If you have an issue with it,
take it up with the paper.

20:24.033 --> 20:27.967
They chose to run it. They
assigned the story.

20:27.967 --> 20:32.100
People are out there killing,
killing! And you focus on me?

20:32.100 --> 20:36.267
One of these days. One of these
days you're gonna regret what
you did to me.

20:36.267 --> 20:40.633
Threaten me again Carlos,

20:40.633 --> 20:44.733
the next story we write about
you will be in the obituaries.

20:48.833 --> 20:52.933
(Engine)

20:52.933 --> 20:57.067
I'll cut you to ribbons boy.

20:57.067 --> 21:00.867
I'll cut you to ribbons!

21:09.333 --> 21:13.433
(Slam)

21:17.233 --> 21:21.233
Help you out there chief?

21:21.233 --> 21:25.533
Yes, my name is Geno McGee. I'm
with the Springfield Herald
newspaper.

21:25.533 --> 21:27.600
I was wondering if I could have
a few words with you?

21:27.600 --> 21:29.500
All I can tell you at this
point is that there are

21:29.500 --> 21:31.500
two victims. One male and one
female.

21:31.500 --> 21:33.533
Victims? So they were murdered.

21:33.533 --> 21:37.567
They weren't murdered. They
were massacred,

21:37.567 --> 21:39.767
but if you quote me on that,
we'll have a problem.

21:39.767 --> 21:41.767
OK, no problem.

21:41.767 --> 21:45.800
So can I see the bodies? Why do
you want to do that for?

21:45.800 --> 21:47.900
If I write about something,
generally I like to see what
I'm writing about.

21:47.900 --> 21:50.067
Come on.

21:50.067 --> 21:53.833
Go ahead and lift up the covers.

21:57.833 --> 22:01.867
OK.

22:01.867 --> 22:05.867
Oh Jesus.

22:05.867 --> 22:10.133
Ah Jesus.

22:10.133 --> 22:14.200
First time seeing dead bodies
young man?

22:14.200 --> 22:16.200
No, that's my cousin and her
boyfriend.

22:16.200 --> 22:18.067
Jesus christ, what happened to
them?

22:18.067 --> 22:22.267
We should talk.

22:22.267 --> 22:24.267
What the hell happened to them?

22:24.267 --> 22:26.300
We are still putting the pieces
together,

22:26.300 --> 22:28.100
but somebody had a bone to pick
with these two.

22:28.100 --> 22:30.100
This is a crime of passion.

22:30.100 --> 22:32.367
Why would you say that?

22:32.367 --> 22:34.400
Because whoever did this turned
them into hamburger,

22:34.400 --> 22:38.500
and didn't take any money or
credit cards.

22:38.500 --> 22:40.533
Do you have any suspects? No,
not yet.

22:40.533 --> 22:42.400
Still gathering evidence, but
we'll find out who did this.

22:42.400 --> 22:46.500
Maybe you know who did it.

22:46.500 --> 22:50.833
Why would I know? Because
whoever did this,

22:50.833 --> 22:52.833
was close to the victims.

22:52.833 --> 22:54.633
We'll meet down at the station,

22:54.633 --> 22:58.733
and you and I will have a
little talk. OK.

22:58.733 --> 23:03.067
OK.

23:03.067 --> 23:06.933
(Thudding)

23:15.133 --> 23:19.400
(Thudding)

23:19.400 --> 23:21.400
Mike Tyson better watch out
there.

23:21.400 --> 23:23.400
What's up Scott? Lynn kicked me
out.

23:23.400 --> 23:27.433
I was hoping to say with you
and mom for a while.

23:27.433 --> 23:29.433
These fucking cunts always get
to keep the house

23:29.433 --> 23:31.233
and all they do is sit on their
fat asses,

23:31.233 --> 23:35.233
and eat like a cow. Scott, you
can stay with me, but that
bitch wife of yours

23:35.233 --> 23:39.667
is gonna pay for this bullshit.
I'm telling you, she's gonna
pay for this bullshit.

23:43.733 --> 23:47.733
You tell Gamelli to fuck off.
He can't have it both ways.

23:47.733 --> 23:51.800
If he wants the papers to move,
they need some spice now don't
they?

23:51.800 --> 23:55.867
Yeah, yeah. Let me let you go.

23:55.867 --> 23:57.733
What's up Geibner?

23:57.733 --> 24:00.067
Why did you give the murder
case to Geno?

24:00.067 --> 24:01.967
He's my lead writer, that's
why.

24:01.967 --> 24:04.067
I vied for that position,

24:04.067 --> 24:07.900
and I'm far more qualified than
your golden boy out there, and
yet

24:07.900 --> 24:10.133
you're keeping me on the
sidelines covering high school
football

24:10.133 --> 24:12.167
while Geno gets the story of
the year?

24:12.167 --> 24:14.233
Maybe of the last ten years.

24:14.233 --> 24:16.300
There is something wrong with
this picture sir.

24:16.300 --> 24:18.167
Look Geibner, we are team here.

24:18.167 --> 24:20.233
Everybody's got their role.

24:20.233 --> 24:24.233
Your role right now is to cover
high school ball and whatever
else I ask you to do.

24:24.233 --> 24:28.567
There are a hundred other
writers out there that would be
dying for your spot.

24:28.567 --> 24:32.500
They'd be out there on that
field with tape recorder in
hand and a big

24:32.500 --> 24:36.833
fat fucking smile on their face
and you got the balls to come
in here and complain?

24:36.833 --> 24:38.867
I want the murder case.

24:38.867 --> 24:40.867
Yeah, and I want three blondes.

24:40.867 --> 24:44.867
One for my face, one for my
dick and one to take pictures,
but that ain't happening.

24:44.867 --> 24:48.900
No, it certainly isn't.

24:48.900 --> 24:50.900
You wouldn't know what to do
with it if it was thrown in
your face.

24:50.900 --> 24:52.900
Get out Geibner!

24:52.900 --> 24:57.100
I'll go over your head if
that's what it takes. Right
over your head.

24:57.100 --> 25:01.067
Don't you cross me boy. Don't
you even think about crossing
me or you will regret it!

25:01.067 --> 25:05.067
See you later Gerald.

25:05.067 --> 25:09.300
Asshole!

25:13.133 --> 25:15.367
How you feeling?

25:15.367 --> 25:17.400
To be honest with you, I'm
really not.

25:17.400 --> 25:21.433
I've only recently reconnected
with my family.

25:21.433 --> 25:25.533
My grandmother recently died.
We were all thrown together

25:25.533 --> 25:29.367
after the funeral. I haven't
seen Sarah in years prior to
Saturday night.

25:29.367 --> 25:33.367
Why did you disconnect with
your family?

25:33.367 --> 25:35.400
Lot of gossip and bullshit like
that.

25:35.400 --> 25:37.400
I just wanted to get away from
it all.

25:37.400 --> 25:39.633
That's sad, but I understand.

25:39.633 --> 25:41.633
Tell me what you know about
Sarah and Tyrone.

25:41.633 --> 25:45.700
I don't want to incriminate
anyone or thrown anyone

25:45.700 --> 25:49.700
under the bus, but my Uncle
Gary had a confrontation

25:49.700 --> 25:53.533
with them Saturday night. What
kind of confrontation?

25:53.533 --> 25:55.767
Basically just a lot of
yelling.

25:55.767 --> 25:57.800
He didn't like the idea of his
daughter dating a black guy.

25:57.800 --> 26:01.700
Yeah Dave.

26:01.700 --> 26:05.833
See if we have a file on Gary
Vershon will yah?

26:05.833 --> 26:10.167
Thanks. Does Gary own any
swords or anything like that

26:10.167 --> 26:14.100
that you know of? I really have
no idea.

26:14.100 --> 26:18.333
Like I said, I really haven't
had any direct contact with any
of these people.

26:18.333 --> 26:22.333
Thanks Dave. Oh, this is very
interesting.

26:22.333 --> 26:24.367
What?

26:24.367 --> 26:26.200
Your uncle's been a bad boy
over the years.

26:26.200 --> 26:28.200
Registered sex offender.

26:28.200 --> 26:30.433
Holy shit! What did he do?

26:30.433 --> 26:34.433
Child pornography. He was
distributing online three years
ago.

26:34.433 --> 26:38.467
Assault and battery on a
stripper in 1998. Disorderly
conduct

26:38.467 --> 26:42.267
in 1999. Shoplifting 2000.
Breaking an entering 2002.

26:42.267 --> 26:46.333
Been arrested 11 times.

26:46.333 --> 26:48.533
No wonder he wouldn't go get a
job.

26:48.533 --> 26:50.333
Who would hire a registered sex
offender

26:50.333 --> 26:52.533
with a long rap sheet?

26:52.533 --> 26:54.533
Geno, I want to thank you for
your time. I'm going to continue

26:54.533 --> 26:58.533
the investigation. Please don't
talk to anyone, especially your
uncle.

26:58.533 --> 27:02.567
About what you know. I'll make
it worth your while.

27:02.567 --> 27:06.567
When we are ready to make a
move, I'll give you a call

27:06.567 --> 27:10.533
and you can break the story,
but if you fuck me,

27:10.533 --> 27:14.867
I will ban you from the scene.
You understand?

27:14.867 --> 27:16.700
I just heard. I'm so sorry.

27:16.700 --> 27:18.933
They butchered her. They
fucking butchered her.

27:18.933 --> 27:22.933
I told her not to fuck a darkie.

27:22.933 --> 27:25.067
Now's not the time for your
idiocy Gary.

27:25.067 --> 27:27.133
Blow it out your ass you fat
bitch.

27:27.133 --> 27:31.067
She was my daughter.

27:31.067 --> 27:35.233
Going to get drunk. Police have
a suspect but they won't tell
me anything.

27:35.233 --> 27:39.267
They will. They'll catch the
bastard and they will fry them.
You can bank on it.

27:39.267 --> 27:41.300
I just don't understand. Sarah
didn't have any enemies.

27:41.300 --> 27:43.333
Did you read Geno's article in
the paper?

27:43.333 --> 27:47.267
Yes. Cold bastard. So freaking
matter of fact

27:47.267 --> 27:49.500
about the whole thing.

27:49.500 --> 27:51.567
I can't believe he's using this
tragedy to try to further his
career.

27:51.567 --> 27:55.667
I was tempted to call him and
tell him off.

27:55.667 --> 27:57.667
He's always been trying to
outshine Scott, but he never
will.

27:57.667 --> 27:59.767
Even with this crap.

27:59.767 --> 28:03.833
(Smooth music)

28:03.833 --> 28:07.900
Hey do you have to do that?

28:07.900 --> 28:09.767
Do what?

28:09.767 --> 28:12.067
Litter. You just through your
scratch ticket on the ground.

28:12.067 --> 28:13.900
We try to keep our neighborhood
clean.

28:13.900 --> 28:16.167
I'd appreciate it if you didn't
throw your trash on my street.

28:16.167 --> 28:20.133
Oh I'm sorry sir. I kind of
have a bad back.

28:20.133 --> 28:22.233
If you could help me pick that
up, I'll put in the trash can
right away.

28:22.233 --> 28:24.300
No problem sir.

28:24.300 --> 28:28.767
The nerve. The absolute nerve!

28:28.767 --> 28:30.900
I'm going to call the cops.
They're going to haul your ass
away.

28:30.900 --> 28:33.067
You don't want to mess with me
boy.

28:33.067 --> 28:37.133
You'd better get to stepping.

28:37.133 --> 28:41.233
(Knocking) Mr. McGee, what are
you doing here?

28:41.233 --> 28:45.333
Where's my son? He's inside.

28:49.333 --> 28:51.333
Boy, I need money. What? What
are you doing here?

28:51.333 --> 28:53.367
I told you never to come around
here.

28:53.367 --> 28:55.200
Why? Because your wife came
onto me.

28:55.200 --> 28:57.267
It was the other way around,

28:57.267 --> 29:01.300
and you know it. When I tell
you not to come around here, I
fucking mean it.

29:01.300 --> 29:03.500
Don't give me your bullshit
boy.

29:03.500 --> 29:05.300
You're not going to sit there
and disrespect me!

29:05.300 --> 29:09.533
Then I will stand up and do it.

29:09.533 --> 29:13.600
Get out of my house. I need
money and you have it.

29:13.600 --> 29:15.467
It doesn't matter what I have
or what I don't have.

29:15.467 --> 29:17.533
You'll not get a dime of it.

29:17.533 --> 29:19.833
I should have drowned you at
birth boy.

29:19.833 --> 29:21.700
I should have slit your throat.

29:21.700 --> 29:24.067
Get out of my house before I
throw you out.

29:24.067 --> 29:26.200
Give it a try. I will fuck you
up,

29:26.200 --> 29:28.200
and then I'll give your wife
what she needs you faggot.

29:28.200 --> 29:30.200
You faggot son of a bitch.

29:34.167 --> 29:38.167
Never again dad.

29:38.167 --> 29:42.400
Never again will you come back
here or you will leave in a
body bag.

29:46.500 --> 29:50.600
I brought you into this world.
I will take you out.

29:50.600 --> 29:54.733
Fucking ingrate.

29:54.733 --> 29:58.767
I'm gonna get that money.

29:58.767 --> 30:02.800
(Rock music)

30:06.900 --> 30:10.700
(Chatter)

30:18.933 --> 30:23.100
(Rock music)

30:23.100 --> 30:27.300
Awesome.

30:35.333 --> 30:39.367
(Banging) Hey, I think you had
enough.

30:39.367 --> 30:43.600
I had enough of your bullshit.
I'm gonna take a fucking leak.

30:43.600 --> 30:47.633
When I come back, if there's
not a drink right here,

30:47.633 --> 30:51.633
on this bar, there's gonna be
some trouble.

30:55.867 --> 30:57.867
Can I help you with something?

30:57.867 --> 30:59.900
Fucking Massachusetts.

30:59.900 --> 31:03.967
They legalize that fucking
marriage,

31:03.967 --> 31:06.067
and I see you two skirts in my
bar.

31:06.067 --> 31:07.967
This is America.

31:07.967 --> 31:12.067
Yeah, this is my country, and
you two deviants are part of
the problem.

31:12.067 --> 31:16.267
Shouldn't you be up the street
at the queer bar? Just go and
eat something.

31:16.267 --> 31:20.133
I think I'm standing too close
I don't want to catch AIDS.

31:20.133 --> 31:24.400
Don't let him get to you.

31:24.400 --> 31:28.467
I'm just so tired of dealing
with white trash like that.

31:28.467 --> 31:32.700
(Engine)

31:36.733 --> 31:40.533
(Slam)

31:40.533 --> 31:44.767
Gary might be a rough customer.
So be ready.

31:44.767 --> 31:46.767
He's likely to be more of a
pain in the ass with all that
booze in his veins.

31:46.767 --> 31:48.767
Want to call for backup?

31:48.767 --> 31:52.933
No, be ready. Ladies.

31:52.933 --> 31:54.967
I don't see my drink bartender.

31:54.967 --> 31:56.800
No, I'm cutting you off.

31:56.800 --> 32:00.933
You're lucky I don't come over
this bar and strangle you.

32:00.933 --> 32:05.233
I'd like to see that. Hey man,
you got five dollars?

32:05.233 --> 32:09.433
Get away from me you piece of
shit.

32:09.433 --> 32:13.633
Wayne, leave Gary alone. Don't
make me call the police now.

32:13.633 --> 32:17.667
Come on big boy, give me five
dollars and I'll fucking suck
your dick.

32:17.667 --> 32:22.067
Faggot fuck. They're coming out
of the woodwork.

32:22.067 --> 32:26.200
(Maniacal laughing)

32:30.433 --> 32:34.500
Gary Vershon.

32:34.500 --> 32:38.733
He wanted his dick sucked for
five dollars.

32:38.733 --> 32:41.067
Now Gary, you know soliciting
prostitution is illegal right?

32:41.067 --> 32:43.067
Who the fuck are you?

32:43.067 --> 32:45.133
I'm detective Dwyer. This is my
partner, detective Adams.

32:45.133 --> 32:47.267
We need to speak to you.

32:47.267 --> 32:49.500
I don't talk to no pig cops.

32:49.500 --> 32:51.500
This can go the easy way or the
hard way.

32:51.500 --> 32:55.533
Let's go right now. I said no
fucking way.

32:55.533 --> 32:59.533
Come on Gary. Put your hands
behind your back.

32:59.533 --> 33:01.567
You're under arrest for the
murder of Sarah Vershon and
Tyrone Williams.

33:01.567 --> 33:03.367
Put your hands behind your
back, or we will put you down.

33:03.367 --> 33:07.600
You think I killed that race
mixing bitch

33:07.600 --> 33:11.600
and her animal lover. Your
grasping at straws.

33:11.600 --> 33:13.633
Get away from me or I'll kick
both of your asses.

33:13.633 --> 33:15.433
Let's take him down.

33:15.433 --> 33:19.633
Come on! Do you fucking mind?

33:19.633 --> 33:24.067
Not at all sweet tits. Let me
see those melons.

33:24.067 --> 33:27.933
You pig. Come on Romeo. Fucking
pigs.

33:27.933 --> 33:32.267
Fucking pigs. You have the
right to remain silent.
Anything you say

33:32.267 --> 33:34.067
can and will be used against
you in a court of law.

33:34.067 --> 33:36.300
Oh I know the routine. Better
not put me in a cell with a
monkey.

33:40.133 --> 33:44.433
(Eerie music)

33:44.433 --> 33:48.367
You OK? Yeah.

33:48.367 --> 33:50.433
Just had another god damn
nightmare.

33:50.433 --> 33:52.700
Have Carmichael take you off
that case.

33:52.700 --> 33:54.800
It's messing with your mind.

33:54.800 --> 33:56.900
I was having these nightmares
before I was put on that case.

33:56.900 --> 33:59.067
They've just gotten worse.

33:59.067 --> 34:01.067
Why are you having them?

34:01.067 --> 34:03.167
There has to be some root
cause.

34:03.167 --> 34:05.267
I find it hard to believe that
you're deathly afraid

34:05.267 --> 34:07.133
of some dead elderly person.

34:07.133 --> 34:09.433
I'm gonna tell you something,

34:09.433 --> 34:11.300
but if you call me crazy, I'll
go sleep on the couch.

34:11.300 --> 34:13.333
I won't call you crazy.

34:13.333 --> 34:17.567
I think my grandmother has
something to do with the
murders of Sarah and her
boyfriend.

34:17.567 --> 34:19.367
How?

34:19.367 --> 34:21.400
I don't have a clue, but I just
feel it.

34:21.400 --> 34:25.467
Claire, get me another beer.

34:25.467 --> 34:29.500
Sam, get off your lazy ass and
get it yourself.

34:29.500 --> 34:31.733
You have to take out the trash
anyway.

34:31.733 --> 34:33.567
God dammit, I'm fucking tired
of you telling me what to do.

34:33.567 --> 34:35.600
Well, you don't have a job now
do you?

34:35.600 --> 34:37.632
So, I have to wear the pants in
the family.

34:49.900 --> 34:54.132
Cunt.

34:54.132 --> 34:58.467
(Eerie music)

35:02.600 --> 35:06.600
(Slam)

35:10.733 --> 35:14.900
(Eerie music)

35:14.900 --> 35:18.700
Anybody over there?

35:26.933 --> 35:30.767
Kitty. Kitty.

35:30.767 --> 35:34.800
Kitty.

35:34.800 --> 35:38.833
(Slam)

35:38.833 --> 35:42.833
(Cutting)

35:42.833 --> 35:46.900
(Ripping)

35:50.900 --> 35:55.067
Sam!

35:55.067 --> 35:59.267
Where the hell are you? You
better not be out here getting
high.

35:59.267 --> 36:03.667
Lazy fat bastard.

36:03.667 --> 36:07.667
Fat bastard.

36:11.933 --> 36:15.867
(Scream)

36:15.867 --> 36:19.967
(Ringing)

36:24.067 --> 36:28.167
(Click)

36:28.167 --> 36:32.267
Hello. Are you serious?

36:32.267 --> 36:36.367
Yeah, I'll be right there.

36:36.367 --> 36:40.633
What happened? Somebody killed
Sam.

36:40.633 --> 36:42.433
Your brother in law Sam?

36:42.433 --> 36:44.500
Yeah, I got to go make sure
Claire is OK.

36:44.500 --> 36:46.500
Want me to go? Yeah, let's go.

36:46.500 --> 36:48.667
How long was he out of the
house?

36:48.667 --> 36:52.833
Maybe 20 minutes. Something
like that.

36:52.833 --> 36:57.067
Has there been anything unusual
going on around here?

36:57.067 --> 36:59.067
Any phone calls out of the
ordinary? Any strangers hanging
around?

36:59.067 --> 37:01.067
Anything like that?

37:01.067 --> 37:03.300
No, nothing.

37:03.300 --> 37:05.167
Was Sarah killed by the same
person?

37:05.167 --> 37:07.433
We don't know.

37:07.433 --> 37:09.467
But Uncle Gary is innocent,
right?

37:09.467 --> 37:13.567
We can't make that kind of
statement Mrs. Slone.

37:17.500 --> 37:21.733
Detective Dwyer, what do we
know?

37:21.733 --> 37:26.067
Not much Geno. We are still
making heads and tails of this.

37:26.067 --> 37:30.067
We should have something for
you this evening. I'll give you
a call.

37:30.067 --> 37:34.400
These detectives are top notch.
They will catch this guy. I
know.

37:34.400 --> 37:36.433
I just can't believe this is
happening.

37:36.433 --> 37:38.433
You can stay with us if you
want to get out of this house.

37:38.433 --> 37:42.433
Thank you. I think I'll be
alright.

37:42.433 --> 37:44.433
We are going to finish up
outside.

37:44.433 --> 37:46.533
If you need anything or you can
think of anything to tell us,

37:46.533 --> 37:50.367
don't hesitate to call. Thank
you detective.

37:50.367 --> 37:52.600
I just talked to the guy next
door. He had some very
interesting things to say.

37:52.600 --> 37:54.633
Oh yeah?

37:54.633 --> 37:58.467
He saw and old lady right here
in the back yard,

37:58.467 --> 38:00.667
just moments before Sam Slone
was killed.

38:00.667 --> 38:02.467
An old lady?

38:02.467 --> 38:04.733
Did he have any description
other than that?

38:04.733 --> 38:06.800
Yeah.

38:06.800 --> 38:08.900
What was it?

38:08.900 --> 38:10.967
Remarkably similar to Phyliss
McGee.

38:10.967 --> 38:13.067
Phyliss McGee, the dead
grandmother?

38:13.067 --> 38:14.867
Come on now. What are you
saying?

38:14.867 --> 38:18.967
We got three dead bodies. All
related in one way or another.

38:18.967 --> 38:23.100
We got one slob in jail that
couldn't have possibly killed
Sam Slone.

38:23.100 --> 38:27.400
Let's say that somebody is
killing off members of this
family

38:27.400 --> 38:31.267
for one reason or another,
dressed like the grandmother.

38:31.267 --> 38:33.533
Are you gonna write about this?

38:33.533 --> 38:35.600
I'll have to.

38:35.600 --> 38:39.533
I guess you do.

38:39.533 --> 38:43.933
It's OK. I understand. I know
it's your job.

38:43.933 --> 38:46.067
Sam was involved with a lot of
bikers.

38:46.067 --> 38:48.133
Do you think he could have
messed with the hell angels or
something?

38:48.133 --> 38:52.367
Sam was home all the time. He
never left the house.

38:52.367 --> 38:54.300
He must have been in the wrong
place at the wrong time.

38:54.300 --> 38:56.633
Uncle Gary didn't kill Sam.

38:56.633 --> 39:00.700
He probably didn't kill Sarah
either. Then who did?

39:00.700 --> 39:04.467
I've been having these horrible
nightmares lately.

39:04.467 --> 39:06.800
Nana's been chasing me around
with a sword.

39:06.800 --> 39:08.900
It's funny that you say that.

39:08.900 --> 39:13.167
She had a sword. After she died
we went to her apartment to
pick up her cane,

39:13.167 --> 39:17.433
and hidden within was a blade.

39:17.433 --> 39:21.267
Anyone home?

39:21.267 --> 39:25.467
Where's that god damn money?

39:25.467 --> 39:29.833
Hanes her way.

39:29.833 --> 39:33.867
Better than panties.

39:33.867 --> 39:37.967
(Eerie music)

39:37.967 --> 39:41.967
Phyliss?

39:41.967 --> 39:45.933
You're dead.

39:49.967 --> 39:54.200
(Eerie music)

40:02.400 --> 40:06.533
(Ripping)

40:06.533 --> 40:10.667
Geno my boy, you are a smash!
The old lady assassin

40:10.667 --> 40:12.700
is flying off the shelves and I
have you to thank for it.

40:12.700 --> 40:14.733
Thank you Mr. Carmichael.

40:14.733 --> 40:18.600
Please call me Jerry. Listen,
I've been thinking of a couple

40:18.600 --> 40:22.733
really good ideas to push this
serial killer angle.

40:22.733 --> 40:24.967
I don't know if that's a good
idea. I'm sort of involved.

40:24.967 --> 40:27.000
That's the great part of it.

40:27.000 --> 40:28.833
Have you thought about the big
picture Geno?

40:28.833 --> 40:30.833
You're in with the cops. You're
in with the family.

40:30.833 --> 40:35.133
Put that together and what does
it fucking mean? I don't know.

40:35.133 --> 40:39.267
Movie deal. That's what it
means.

40:39.267 --> 40:41.267
Listen, I know some people in
New York City

40:41.267 --> 40:43.067
and they got deep pockets just
looking for a storyline.

40:43.067 --> 40:47.133
You and I can make a fortune.
We'll split the money down the
middle.

40:47.133 --> 40:51.400
Look at the movies that made
money. Amityville Horror. Texas
Chainsaw Massacre.

40:51.400 --> 40:55.333
Do you know why they were so
successful?

40:55.333 --> 40:59.667
They were based on a true story
Geno and that's exactly what we
got right here.

40:59.667 --> 41:03.767
We need to jump on this. We
need to jump on this now.

41:03.767 --> 41:07.900
I don't know. I got to think
about this. Think about it.

41:07.900 --> 41:09.967
Think about having a million or
so bucks in your bank account.

41:09.967 --> 41:11.833
You know where to find me.

41:16.067 --> 41:18.067
Hey there star. Thanks.

41:18.067 --> 41:20.100
How you hanging in there?

41:20.100 --> 41:21.900
Honestly, they're running me
ragged.

41:21.900 --> 41:24.100
I think I need to go back and
cover the pervert police.

41:24.100 --> 41:28.200
I'm not cut out for this blood
and guts.

41:28.200 --> 41:30.067
You need to relax. That's what
you need.

41:30.067 --> 41:32.267
You can say that again.

41:32.267 --> 41:34.100
My parents are away this
weekend.

41:34.100 --> 41:36.367
Why don't you come over to the
house and take a dip in the hot
tub?

41:36.367 --> 41:38.167
I don't think my wife would
approve of that Britney.

41:38.167 --> 41:40.200
To hell with your wife.

41:40.200 --> 41:42.200
Have some fun.

41:42.200 --> 41:44.433
Tell her you're covering
something for the paper and
stop by the house.

41:44.433 --> 41:48.533
I'm sorry. It's very tempting,
but I know my wife,

41:48.533 --> 41:52.600
and I'm sure if I even stopped
by your house to say hello,

41:52.600 --> 41:54.633
I'd be the next Bobbit.

41:54.633 --> 41:56.667
The offer is on the table.

42:00.733 --> 42:02.767
Yes Mr. Carmichael.

42:02.767 --> 42:04.833
Please shut the door.

42:04.833 --> 42:06.833
Take a seat.

42:06.833 --> 42:08.867
Yes sir. What's up?

42:08.867 --> 42:13.067
Your time is up young lady. I'm
god damn sick of you walking
around here

42:13.067 --> 42:15.067
like a cat in heat.

42:15.067 --> 42:16.267
Wait a second. Don't talk to me
like that.

42:16.267 --> 42:17.833
I run the show here

42:17.833 --> 42:19.233
and I'll talk to you as I
please.

42:19.233 --> 42:21.100
You got that? I'm not some
walking hard on

42:21.100 --> 42:25.133
like some of these writers out
there on the floor that drool
whenever you walk by.

42:25.133 --> 42:27.167
You're a distraction Britney.

42:27.167 --> 42:29.200
What do you want me to do, wear
a bag over my head?

42:29.200 --> 42:33.067
No. What I want you to do is go
home. I'm done with you.

42:33.067 --> 42:35.300
And why is that?

42:35.300 --> 42:37.367
Um, mostly, because you annoy
me,

42:37.367 --> 42:39.367
but you're also coming onto a
married man.

42:39.367 --> 42:41.400
What are you, the morality
police?

42:41.400 --> 42:45.233
No, I run this paper and you're
gone.

42:45.233 --> 42:49.533
You're going to learn young
lady that bad things can happen
to bad girls.

42:49.533 --> 42:53.600
Very bad things.

42:53.600 --> 42:57.633
(Mellow music)

43:01.833 --> 43:05.633
(Mellow music)

43:13.900 --> 43:18.067
Hey there. Hello.

43:18.067 --> 43:20.067
What's the matter?

43:20.067 --> 43:22.067
Nothing's wrong. Just leave me
alone.

43:22.067 --> 43:26.167
Do you like me? What?

43:26.167 --> 43:30.333
I'm a real good fuck. I can
fuck all night long.

43:30.333 --> 43:32.167
Get lost before I call the god
damn police.

43:32.167 --> 43:34.400
Come on bitch.

43:34.400 --> 43:36.300
Put out!

43:36.300 --> 43:38.600
Help! Somebody help me!

43:38.600 --> 43:42.800
We can share her!

43:42.800 --> 43:44.933
You sick fucking bastard.

43:44.933 --> 43:46.867
What? are you a homosexual?

43:46.867 --> 43:51.367
(Thudding)

43:51.367 --> 43:55.533
(Groans)

43:55.533 --> 43:59.567
(Thudding)

44:07.867 --> 44:12.067
Are you OK? Yeah, I think so.

44:12.067 --> 44:16.133
Use your cell phone. Call the
cops.

44:16.133 --> 44:20.300
Hello. A guy just tried to rape
me.

44:20.300 --> 44:22.200
I'm at the Springfield Herald
and a guy just tried to rape me.

44:22.200 --> 44:24.467
Yes I'm safe now.

44:24.467 --> 44:28.433
My co-worker knocked him out.
He's in front of me.

44:28.433 --> 44:32.867
OK. Thanks. My unlucky day
today Geno.

44:32.867 --> 44:37.100
I got fired and nearly raped.

44:37.100 --> 44:39.233
Carmichael fired you? Why?

44:39.233 --> 44:41.333
Who cares? You have my email
address. Stay in touch.

44:41.333 --> 44:45.367
I will.

44:45.367 --> 44:47.700
You got a world of talent.

44:47.700 --> 44:49.800
Don't let this bullshit saw you
from chasing your dreams.

44:49.800 --> 44:53.933
OK. Thank you.

44:53.933 --> 44:56.100
Hey there coach. How do you
think your lions did today?

44:56.100 --> 44:58.433
Well we won, didn't we?

44:58.433 --> 45:00.533
Yeah, you sure did, but not by
too much though.

45:00.533 --> 45:02.267
Did you think it was gonna be
that close?

45:02.267 --> 45:04.567
You never know, but a win is a
win.

45:04.567 --> 45:06.433
I think we'll do a lot better
the next time out.

45:06.433 --> 45:10.667
That if we're not all butchered
by then.

45:10.667 --> 45:12.667
You're referring to the recent
murders.

45:12.667 --> 45:14.867
Well, the police are doing what
they can

45:14.867 --> 45:16.967
which is admittedly not very
much.

45:16.967 --> 45:18.867
Exactly.

45:18.867 --> 45:23.200
I want my team in the paper. It
makes them feel good and try
hard.

45:23.200 --> 45:25.300
There's a psycho out there and
this is a waste of time.

45:25.300 --> 45:27.367
Why don't you try to figure
this out. You're smart.

45:27.367 --> 45:29.367
I've read your stuff. Sharp as
a tack.

45:29.367 --> 45:31.400
A lot better than the other guy
they have on it.

45:31.400 --> 45:35.400
Well, my boss wants me out here
covering this kind of stuff now.

45:35.400 --> 45:37.400
And my dad wanted me to be an
accountant.

45:37.400 --> 45:39.400
Sometimes you have to go with
what you feel.

45:39.400 --> 45:43.200
Go with your instincts. The
cops aren't going to solve
this. Your boy at the paper
isn't.

45:43.200 --> 45:47.400
But you can. You can.

45:47.400 --> 45:51.533
Let's go over this. Geno
McGee's grandmother Phyliss
dies.

45:51.533 --> 45:55.433
Geno returns to see his family
for the first time in years,

45:55.433 --> 45:57.633
and now we have three bodies on
our hands.

45:57.633 --> 45:59.067
So you suspect McGee.

45:59.067 --> 46:01.300
Well, I don't rule him out.

46:01.300 --> 46:03.700
Let's put it that way. But why
would this one death spark a
blood bath?

46:03.700 --> 46:07.567
And why kill these particular
people? Completely unremarkable
people.

46:07.567 --> 46:11.567
Sarah was a high school
dropout. So was Tyrone.

46:11.567 --> 46:15.767
And Slone hadn't worked for
nearly twenty years.

46:15.767 --> 46:19.567
Maybe the killer hates
laziness. He sees these three
people

46:19.567 --> 46:21.567
aren't going anywhere and it
bugs him,

46:21.567 --> 46:23.800
and perhaps he's close to the
grandmother.

46:23.800 --> 46:25.600
Her dying sends him over the
edge

46:25.600 --> 46:27.633
and now he has the balls to do
something like this.

46:27.633 --> 46:31.833
I can't see it Adams. I just
can't see it.

46:31.833 --> 46:35.667
The picture is bigger than
that. There's a connection we
are missing.

46:35.667 --> 46:37.667
There's a piece of this puzzle
that we still have to find.

46:37.667 --> 46:39.867
Why was it that McGee said he
lost touch with the family?

46:39.867 --> 46:43.700
Something about gossip and
bullshit he didn't want his
wife to have to put up with.

46:43.700 --> 46:47.833
Something like that. Well let's
follow the money here Dwyer.

46:47.833 --> 46:49.833
Geno's the only one benefiting
from the murders so far.

46:49.833 --> 46:51.867
How so?

46:51.867 --> 46:55.900
Think about it. Here's a guy
writing about female fucking
softball

46:55.900 --> 47:00.067
for the local paper but then
this happens. Now he's a big
featured

47:00.067 --> 47:04.067
investigative reporter. He
probably got a raise and
promotion.

47:04.067 --> 47:08.267
And his wife. She won't have to
deal with his family anymore,
is she?

47:08.267 --> 47:10.300
Once they're all taken out.

47:10.300 --> 47:12.300
So, why dress up like the
grandmother?

47:12.300 --> 47:16.133
We'll have to ask him that when
we find him.

47:16.133 --> 47:18.333
I think we need to pay a little
bit of attention to this
reporter friend of ours.

47:18.333 --> 47:20.133
I agree.

47:20.133 --> 47:24.133
But let's not focus on him
alone. I don't get the vibe
from Geno

47:24.133 --> 47:26.133
that he's capable of this kind
of thing. He doesn't seem like
the kind.

47:26.133 --> 47:28.367
They rarely do.

47:28.367 --> 47:32.400
People can hide what they are
at their core very well at
times.

47:32.400 --> 47:36.433
But eventually it rears its
ugly head.

47:36.433 --> 47:40.233
It's nearly impossible to lead
two lives.

47:40.233 --> 47:44.300
Nearly impossible.

47:44.300 --> 47:46.600
Geno, how are you?

47:46.600 --> 47:48.700
I'm fine.

47:48.700 --> 47:50.800
What can I do for you Nelson?

47:50.800 --> 47:52.933
Well, there's some fucked up
stuff going on around here.

47:52.933 --> 47:56.933
I'm shit scared. I don't feel
safe and I don't think you are
either.

47:56.933 --> 47:58.733
Jesus christ, they killed my
sister.

47:58.733 --> 48:00.933
Yeah, I know. I'm really sorry
to hear about that.

48:00.933 --> 48:04.967
So is your dad still behind
bars?

48:04.967 --> 48:06.800
No, they let him out yesterday.

48:06.800 --> 48:09.067
He's at home, drunk on the
couch. Passed out as usual.

48:09.067 --> 48:11.067
Then what are you doing here.

48:11.067 --> 48:13.067
I overheard something the other
day, and I think you might be
interested.

48:13.067 --> 48:17.200
OK. My mother was talking to
Carol,

48:17.200 --> 48:19.267
and she mentioned some sort of
family secret.

48:19.267 --> 48:21.167
When I walked into the room,
she totally dropped the subject.

48:21.167 --> 48:23.433
What do you think that means?

48:23.433 --> 48:25.533
I have no clue. What do you
mean you have no clue.

48:25.533 --> 48:27.433
You're a god damn investigative
reporter.

48:27.433 --> 48:29.733
People are dying and there's a
family secret.

48:29.733 --> 48:33.767
Read the writing on the wall.
They're talking about Nana.

48:33.767 --> 48:35.667
They could be talking about a
recipe for mint brownies for
all we know.

48:35.667 --> 48:37.967
They mentioned Papa too and
they seemed worried about him.

48:37.967 --> 48:40.067
Like he knew something.

48:40.067 --> 48:41.900
You know, I'm not interested in
your conspiracy theories
Nelson. I'm not.

48:41.900 --> 48:45.967
You know, I'm not even
interested in this case anymore.

48:45.967 --> 48:50.133
I can't sleep at night. I'm
having nightmares about Nana

48:50.133 --> 48:54.300
chasing me around. My boss at
work is up my ass and I'm at my
breaking point.

48:54.300 --> 48:56.333
Wouldn't hurt to talk to him
Geno.

48:56.333 --> 48:58.567
Talk to him about what?

48:58.567 --> 49:00.667
When we get there, we will cut
right to the chase.

49:00.667 --> 49:02.633
We will mention a family
secret. If he seems clueless,
we'll split.

49:02.633 --> 49:06.433
And then drive three hours
home. It's just not worth it.

49:06.433 --> 49:09.433
I mean what could he know?

49:09.433 --> 49:11.667
I think he knows what's going
on and that's why he abandoned
this family all those years ago.

49:11.667 --> 49:14.633
No, he hated his wife. That's
why he wasn't at her funeral,

49:14.633 --> 49:18.700
and that's why he left this
family. It's just that simple.

49:18.700 --> 49:22.800
Listen, I'll go alone, but I
much rather you come with me.

49:22.800 --> 49:26.900
(Soft music)

49:35.067 --> 49:39.267
(Soft music)

49:47.533 --> 49:51.700
(Soft music)

50:00.067 --> 50:03.767
(Soft music)

50:11.867 --> 50:16.067
(Soft music)

50:16.067 --> 50:20.400
(Knocking)

50:24.567 --> 50:28.567
Hello.

50:28.567 --> 50:30.667
Hi, you probably don't
recognize us.

50:30.667 --> 50:32.967
But we're your grandchildren.
I'm Geno McGee.

50:32.967 --> 50:36.767
This is Nelson Verson. Oh my
god.

50:36.767 --> 50:41.000
I can't believe it's you.
Welcome. Come on in please.

50:41.000 --> 50:45.033
Come on in.

50:45.033 --> 50:49.267
You know guys,

50:49.267 --> 50:53.267
I feel I actually owe you both
an apology.

50:53.267 --> 50:57.167
Many times I wanted to get in
touch with both of you,

50:57.167 --> 51:01.400
but I didn't want to bring you
into this. I wanted to keep you
out of this,

51:01.400 --> 51:03.433
but you were always in my
thoughts.

51:03.433 --> 51:05.433
Thank you.

51:05.433 --> 51:07.467
So, what do I owe this great
pleasure?

51:07.467 --> 51:09.467
I'm a writer for the
Springfield Herald newspaper.

51:09.467 --> 51:13.533
Oh a writer? I used to do some
writing.

51:13.533 --> 51:17.433
When I first met your
grandmother, I used to write
her poems

51:17.433 --> 51:21.700
Speaking of Nana, did you hear
that she died?

51:21.700 --> 51:23.500
I did. Yes, I did.

51:23.500 --> 51:25.500
We didn't see you at the
funeral Papa.

51:25.500 --> 51:29.767
I had my reasons. I did have my
reasons.

51:29.767 --> 51:31.600
Did you hear about the murders
that happened last week?

51:31.600 --> 51:33.833
Yes I did and they were
terrible.

51:33.833 --> 51:35.700
I was sorry to hear about them.

51:35.700 --> 51:37.767
A lot of strange things have
been happening,

51:37.767 --> 51:42.067
and we thought that maybe you
could help us sort this out.

51:42.067 --> 51:46.067
I'm just one old man. What can
I do?

51:46.067 --> 51:48.233
Last week Nelson heard your
daughter talk about a family
secret

51:48.233 --> 51:50.267
and I was wondering what that
meant.

52:06.300 --> 52:10.533
Let me ask you something Geno.

52:10.533 --> 52:14.367
If there was something out
there that was so terrible,

52:14.367 --> 52:18.567
that if you saw it, it'd make
you want to commit suicide
would you still want to see it?

52:18.567 --> 52:22.600
Would you like to be dropped
into a basket of live
rattlesnakes?

52:22.600 --> 52:26.633
Look, I just want to do my job
and maybe save a few lives.

52:26.633 --> 52:30.667
There is no saving lives. The
only way to save lives

52:30.667 --> 52:34.600
is to get the fuck out of
there. You're terrified.

52:34.600 --> 52:38.867
You're trembling. What the hell
do you know?

52:38.867 --> 52:42.933
Interesting choice of words.
Hell.

52:42.933 --> 52:46.933
I know a lot about hell and I'm
not going to drop you in the
meat grinder.

52:46.933 --> 52:50.833
The family secret has to stay a
secret.

52:50.833 --> 52:54.867
And if you're not supposed to
know it, you're dead.

52:54.867 --> 52:57.100
Does the family secret have
anything to do with the murders?

52:57.100 --> 52:59.133
What a foolish question young
boy.

52:59.133 --> 53:02.967
Yes, certainly. Of course it
does.

53:02.967 --> 53:07.233
But do not chase this thing. Do
not chase it. I am gonna chase
it.

53:07.233 --> 53:11.300
And I'm gonna catch it. People
are dying

53:11.300 --> 53:13.333
and I'm not going to stand back
and let that happen.

53:13.333 --> 53:15.400
Geno, you're only one person.
One.

53:15.400 --> 53:19.300
What you want to confront is
beyond reason,

53:19.300 --> 53:23.600
beyond your comprehension. Even
if you saw it, you wouldn't
believe it.

53:23.600 --> 53:27.433
I thought I was tough. I
thought I was a bad ass mother
fucker.

53:27.433 --> 53:31.667
Until they showed me what they
were

53:31.667 --> 53:33.500
and how far it spread.

53:33.500 --> 53:35.533
I've been having nightmares
about Nana.

53:35.533 --> 53:39.867
They're calling you my boy.
They're calling you.

53:39.867 --> 53:43.700
And they have their eye on you.

53:43.700 --> 53:47.733
What do you mean? Nana's
calling me? She's not dead what?

53:47.733 --> 53:51.767
Let me put it this way. What's
black is white.

53:51.767 --> 53:56.067
And what white is black. Don't
believe anything you see,

53:56.067 --> 54:00.067
and don't trust anyone.

54:00.067 --> 54:02.067
They're all dirty.

54:02.067 --> 54:04.300
Hey. What's this about?

54:04.300 --> 54:08.367
Something big. Something really
big.

54:08.367 --> 54:10.433
Been doing some investigation
into this old lady killer.

54:10.433 --> 54:12.500
What? I told you to cover
sports.

54:12.500 --> 54:14.367
Don't get your panties in a
bunch. I am covering sports,

54:14.367 --> 54:16.633
but I'm looking into this too,

54:16.633 --> 54:20.433
and I figured some shit out.
Been talking to some of the
townies

54:20.433 --> 54:22.467
and they helped me piece the
puzzle together.

54:22.467 --> 54:24.467
OK, tell me about your puzzle.

54:24.467 --> 54:26.467
What do you know about Geno
McGee?

54:26.467 --> 54:28.667
He's my lead writer. I know
that.

54:28.667 --> 54:32.567
Take a look.

54:32.567 --> 54:36.633
What exactly am I looking at
here Geibner.

54:36.633 --> 54:38.667
When Geno was 16, he nearly
killed his father.

54:38.667 --> 54:40.933
He attacked him with a knife
for christ's sake.

54:40.933 --> 54:44.733
And now there's somebody
running around, dressed like
Geno's dead grandmother,

54:44.733 --> 54:46.967
killing somebody with a knife
of some sort.

54:46.967 --> 54:49.067
Geno is no killer. You don't
know that.

54:49.067 --> 54:52.800
What you do know is that
putting him on this case was a
massive conflict of interest.

54:52.800 --> 54:56.833
Look it. The only thing I know
is that you don't know shit.

54:56.833 --> 55:01.100
Geno had it out with his dad.
So what? What 16 year old
doesn't?

55:01.100 --> 55:05.067
You let your jealousy get the
best of you here Geibner. Geno
is on this one,

55:05.067 --> 55:06.867
and I want you forget this case
even exists.

55:06.867 --> 55:09.067
Not a chance.

55:09.067 --> 55:11.100
Then you're fired.

55:11.100 --> 55:12.933
So be it. So be it.

55:12.933 --> 55:17.167
When I figure this shit out,
you're going down too Carmichael

55:17.167 --> 55:18.933
and I will own this paper.

55:18.933 --> 55:20.933
Leave right now!

55:20.933 --> 55:25.200
(Eerie music)

55:29.267 --> 55:33.400
Sue, what's all the noise out
here?

55:33.400 --> 55:37.533
Oh come on girl, don't be like
that.

55:49.733 --> 55:53.800
(Cracking)

56:01.967 --> 56:05.800
(Cracking)

56:13.867 --> 56:18.100
Call detective Dwyer
immediately. He needs to speak
with you.

56:18.100 --> 56:22.233
Why are you so worried?

56:22.233 --> 56:26.333
He asked about your whereabouts
the nights of the murders and
Scott's house just burnt down.

56:26.333 --> 56:28.133
He wants to know where you
were.

56:28.133 --> 56:30.133
They fucking suspect you Geno.
They think that you're the
killer.

56:30.133 --> 56:34.333
Bullshit.

56:38.400 --> 56:42.600
Yes, can I speak to detective
Dwyer please.

56:42.600 --> 56:46.700
OK. Yes. detective.

56:46.700 --> 56:50.633
Yeah, yeah, I can come down.

56:50.633 --> 56:54.733
Can I ask what this pertains
to? OK.

56:54.733 --> 56:56.833
I'm on my way. Are they gonna
arrest you?

56:56.833 --> 56:59.133
For what?

56:59.133 --> 57:03.333
I haven't done anything. Look,
just calm down.

57:03.333 --> 57:05.167
Have a cup of tea. Relax. I'll
be home in an hour or so.

57:05.167 --> 57:11.167
They probably just want to
bring me to the fire for my
report or something.

57:11.167 --> 57:13.233
Just calm down.

57:13.233 --> 57:15.500
Geno, please have a seat.

57:15.500 --> 57:19.533
Sure. We have some things to
talk about.

57:19.533 --> 57:21.367
You know you scared the shit
out of my wife, right?

57:21.367 --> 57:23.567
Sorry about that, but let's
move on OK?

57:23.567 --> 57:27.467
Geno, trying to put the pieces
of this puzzle together

57:27.467 --> 57:31.733
and you keep coming up,
everywhere.

57:31.733 --> 57:35.800
You don't show your face for
ten years and now you're back
and people are dying.

57:35.800 --> 57:39.700
You tell your sister that
you're having nightmares and
she should get rid of

57:39.700 --> 57:43.767
her dead weight of a husband
and now he is dead weight.

57:43.767 --> 57:45.833
You visit you grandfather today
and now he's dead.

57:45.833 --> 57:47.900
What?

57:47.900 --> 57:52.200
Found his body all sliced up.
What am I supposed to think
Geno?

57:52.200 --> 57:56.200
I was with Nelson all day. He
was with me.

57:56.200 --> 58:00.100
Before, during and after my
meeting with my grandfather.

58:00.100 --> 58:04.233
He can clear my name.

58:04.233 --> 58:06.233
Yeah, or he can lie for you.

58:06.233 --> 58:08.067
Fuck you. This is your idea,
isn't it?

58:08.067 --> 58:12.267
I got to admit, dressing up
like your dead grandmother.
That's original.

58:12.267 --> 58:16.267
It's a first I think. Maybe Ed
Gein thought of it first.

58:16.267 --> 58:20.300
But you're going to be right up
there with

58:20.300 --> 58:24.300
John Wayne Gacy and Jeffrey
Dahmer. You're gonna be famous.

58:24.300 --> 58:28.133
Detective Dwyer, I want to
speak to you one on one,

58:28.133 --> 58:32.133
if not, I want a lawyer, now.

58:32.133 --> 58:36.367
Whatever you want.

58:36.367 --> 58:40.500
Geno, talk to me man. How do
you explain this?

58:40.500 --> 58:44.633
Your grandfather dies
immediately after you visit him.

58:44.633 --> 58:48.600
Doesn't make sense. None of
this makes any sense.

58:48.600 --> 58:52.833
He knew something. Something
about a family secret.

58:52.833 --> 58:56.900
They found out somehow and they
got to him. Who are they?

58:56.900 --> 59:00.867
I don't know. He didn't say.

59:00.867 --> 59:05.100
But, the serial killer is only
the tip of the iceberg.

59:05.100 --> 59:09.200
I'm telling you, if we get this
old bitch.

59:09.200 --> 59:13.067
It might just be the first
brick in the road of uncovering
something enormous.

59:13.067 --> 59:17.333
Let's talk a little about the
fire at the Garvey residence.

59:17.333 --> 59:21.400
I don't know anything about it.
I was away all day,

59:21.400 --> 59:25.467
and if you clear me on that,
you have to clear me on the
rest.

59:25.467 --> 59:27.300
I'm not a killer detective. I'm
a reporter.

59:27.300 --> 59:29.533
That's why I keep showing up.

59:29.533 --> 59:33.400
I'm covering a case that you're
trying to solve.

59:33.400 --> 59:35.467
You're wasting your time with
me.

59:35.467 --> 59:37.733
I'm gonna level with you Geno.

59:37.733 --> 59:41.633
I've dealt with some cold
bastards. Killers that strangle
their mothers

59:41.633 --> 59:45.967
and rape their grandmothers and
never shed a tear.

59:45.967 --> 59:50.067
You are either innocent or
you're the coldest son of a
bitch I've ever met.

59:50.067 --> 59:54.067
I'm gonna give you the benefit
of the doubt.

59:54.067 --> 59:58.133
You can leave, but don't stray
too far. I'm gonna sort this
mess out.

59:58.133 --> 01:00:02.500
This is a family issue.

01:00:02.500 --> 01:00:06.333
And I'm gonna find out who's
spilling all this blood.

01:00:06.333 --> 01:00:10.333
So they charge you yet?

01:00:10.333 --> 01:00:12.367
Charge me with what Geibner?

01:00:12.367 --> 01:00:14.400
With murder. They're gonna
figure it out

01:00:14.400 --> 01:00:16.667
and you're gonna get charged.

01:00:16.667 --> 01:00:18.700
You can't hide behind your
granny's dress forever.

01:00:18.700 --> 01:00:22.567
Why don't you leave me alone?
Hey arent you unemployed?

01:00:22.567 --> 01:00:24.800
What are you doing with this
fucking tape recorder.

01:00:24.800 --> 01:00:26.600
You got no one to turn it into.

01:00:26.600 --> 01:00:28.633
Yeah, I don't shine Gerald's
knob like you do.

01:00:28.633 --> 01:00:30.667
You didn't answer the question.
They charge you yet?

01:00:30.667 --> 01:00:34.833
Get off me. I know you're the
killer.

01:00:34.833 --> 01:00:39.100
I can feel it. And I'm gonna
expose you to the whole world.

01:00:39.100 --> 01:00:43.000
It's no wonder you never got a
promotion.

01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:47.233
Your investigative skills are
worse than your writing ability.

01:00:47.233 --> 01:00:51.067
Whatever you say killer. I'm
not afraid of you killer.

01:00:51.067 --> 01:00:55.433
Maybe you should be.

01:00:59.633 --> 01:01:03.667
(Noise)

01:01:12.133 --> 01:01:15.967
Hey Nelson, you and your bitch
watch this. This is how you
fucking bowl.

01:01:20.067 --> 01:01:24.333
(Slam)

01:01:24.333 --> 01:01:28.533
Yeah! I'm gonna take a fucking
leak.

01:01:32.433 --> 01:01:36.700
I know Cindy. He's an asshole.

01:01:36.700 --> 01:01:38.533
Hey cunt. How about a date.

01:01:38.533 --> 01:01:40.533
Gary, you need to relax and
keep it in your pants.

01:01:40.533 --> 01:01:44.800
Why do you have to play so hard
to get?

01:01:44.800 --> 01:01:46.833
Because you disgust me.

01:01:46.833 --> 01:01:48.833
Cock tease.

01:01:48.833 --> 01:01:52.833
Hmm.

01:01:57.067 --> 01:01:59.300
Wendy are you alright?

01:01:59.300 --> 01:02:01.333
Absolutely. I know how to deal
with guys like that.

01:02:01.333 --> 01:02:03.367
I can talk to him if you want
me to.

01:02:03.367 --> 01:02:05.200
Thanks Banas, but I don't need
a man to fight my battles.

01:02:05.200 --> 01:02:07.500
If he insists on being a prick,
I'll just call the cops and
have him removed.

01:02:07.500 --> 01:02:09.567
The offer stands.

01:02:09.567 --> 01:02:13.567
(Eerie music)

01:02:17.400 --> 01:02:21.700
I got you Geno. I got you.

01:02:21.700 --> 01:02:25.800
(Slashing)

01:02:33.967 --> 01:02:38.067
What's your issue baldy?

01:02:38.067 --> 01:02:39.867
You're the one with an issue,
not me.

01:02:39.867 --> 01:02:42.100
The only issue I got, is some
bald pecker staring at me.

01:02:42.100 --> 01:02:46.067
Don't even talk to him Banas.

01:02:46.067 --> 01:02:50.067
Yeah, listen to your bitch. Get
yourself hurt you bald fuck.

01:02:50.067 --> 01:02:54.233
Hello girls.

01:02:54.233 --> 01:02:58.300
Ready for another game. We
should probably pack it in.

01:02:58.300 --> 01:03:02.367
It's getting late. Late? I'm in
no rush to call it a night.

01:03:02.367 --> 01:03:06.433
Let's go to the casino. I'm
feeling lucky tonight. Come on.

01:03:06.433 --> 01:03:08.300
Don't you need a job before you
spend money at a casino?

01:03:08.300 --> 01:03:10.333
Who the fuck told you to talk?

01:03:10.333 --> 01:03:14.667
Don't you think it's messed up
that you take your wife's money
from that freaking donut shop

01:03:14.667 --> 01:03:16.500
and spend it at a casino? Why
don't you get a job?

01:03:16.500 --> 01:03:18.533
Can we drop this already,
please.

01:03:18.533 --> 01:03:22.733
Get her in line there boy. You
get her in line. I'd never let
your mother pipe up like that.

01:03:22.733 --> 01:03:24.567
Hey we're going to the girl's
room. We need some money.

01:03:24.567 --> 01:03:26.600
Why would you need money for
the girl's room.

01:03:26.600 --> 01:03:28.833
We need soda stupid. Give us
money.

01:03:28.833 --> 01:03:30.667
I want the change.

01:03:38.933 --> 01:03:42.733
Lane six is jammed.

01:03:42.733 --> 01:03:47.067
Can you take care of it? On it.
Wendy, I was wondering.

01:03:47.067 --> 01:03:49.067
I have a couple of tickets for
the Danzig concert this
Saturday night.

01:03:49.067 --> 01:03:50.933
Wanna come with me?

01:03:50.933 --> 01:03:54.933
Sorry, but I think we've been
over this ground before. Forget
it!

01:03:54.933 --> 01:03:56.967
Just forget I said anything at
all. You know what your problem
is?

01:03:56.967 --> 01:03:59.200
You go out with these total
scumbags that treat you like
shit.

01:03:59.200 --> 01:04:03.300
Maybe you like that kind of
treatment. You won't hear
another word out of me.

01:04:03.300 --> 01:04:05.100
Live your life. I'm sorry I
hurt your feelings.

01:04:05.100 --> 01:04:07.300
I have a lane to fix.

01:04:11.433 --> 01:04:15.367
Hey Baldy.

01:04:15.367 --> 01:04:19.467
He's got no hair. No hair at
all.

01:04:19.467 --> 01:04:21.700
He just introduced me to his
parents.

01:04:21.700 --> 01:04:23.733
That's a good thing. Not
really. His dad is 400 pounds.

01:04:23.733 --> 01:04:25.733
If he follows in his footsteps,

01:04:25.733 --> 01:04:27.733
he'll be a beached whale and I
won't be with a guy that has a
bigger chest than me.

01:04:27.733 --> 01:04:31.867
(Laughter)

01:04:31.867 --> 01:04:33.867
(Knocking) What is taking you
so long? Other people have to
use it.

01:04:33.867 --> 01:04:35.867
What, did you fall in or
something?

01:04:35.867 --> 01:04:39.900
(Screaming)

01:04:39.900 --> 01:04:44.100
They can't still be in the
bathroom. Larry can you check
it out?

01:04:44.100 --> 01:04:46.067
I'm not going in the girl's
bathroom.

01:04:46.067 --> 01:04:48.333
Come on man.

01:04:48.333 --> 01:04:50.433
Just go, knock. If they don't
come out, just come back, OK?

01:04:50.433 --> 01:04:52.567
Fine.

01:04:52.567 --> 01:04:56.800
(Knocking)

01:05:01.067 --> 01:05:04.900
Angela! Angela!

01:05:04.900 --> 01:05:09.267
(Slam) They ditched us. They
took your car and they left us.

01:05:09.267 --> 01:05:13.467
Angela is a prankster man. She
thinks this is cute.

01:05:13.467 --> 01:05:15.267
I got her cute hanging for her
right here.

01:05:15.267 --> 01:05:17.467
Do you have your keys?

01:05:17.467 --> 01:05:21.900
No. Shit. I'll be right back.

01:05:21.900 --> 01:05:25.833
(Eerie music)

01:05:38.367 --> 01:05:42.233
Changed your mind about those
Danzig tickets huh?

01:05:42.233 --> 01:05:46.533
I don't blame you. Listen, this
isn't going to work Wendy. Can
you do me a favor.

01:05:46.533 --> 01:05:50.400
Grab me a nine, sixteenths.
Nine sixteenths. Wendy.

01:05:50.400 --> 01:05:54.600
Wendy, nine sixteenths. Wendy!

01:05:54.600 --> 01:05:58.633
(Crack)

01:06:06.700 --> 01:06:10.567
Yo Jeremy what you doing bro?

01:06:10.567 --> 01:06:14.833
Jeremy? Oh my god Jeremy! Oh my
god!

01:06:14.833 --> 01:06:18.900
Jeremy!

01:06:18.900 --> 01:06:23.067
(Rustling)

01:06:23.067 --> 01:06:26.900
Come on. Let's go bitch.

01:06:26.900 --> 01:06:31.067
(Thudding)

01:06:31.067 --> 01:06:35.333
(Bang)

01:06:39.467 --> 01:06:43.533
(Bang) What the fuck is your
problem?

01:06:43.533 --> 01:06:47.600
Who did you tell? Who the fuck
did you talk to?

01:06:47.600 --> 01:06:51.433
Only you and I knew we were
going to see Papa and now he's
been butchered

01:06:51.433 --> 01:06:53.433
and the police suspect me.

01:06:53.433 --> 01:06:55.667
Let him go Geno. Let him go!
You set me up!

01:06:55.667 --> 01:06:59.700
Whoever's going around killing
people found out we went to see
Papa

01:06:59.700 --> 01:07:01.700
and you're the only one who
could have said anything.

01:07:01.700 --> 01:07:03.700
Geno, that's enough.

01:07:03.700 --> 01:07:05.767
Blow it out your ass Gary.

01:07:05.767 --> 01:07:07.600
No, no, leave my son alone.

01:07:07.600 --> 01:07:11.700
Or else. What, are you in on
this too?

01:07:11.700 --> 01:07:13.733
Is that why you're protecting
Nelson here?

01:07:13.733 --> 01:07:15.967
Why don't you chill out Geno.
You're losing it.

01:07:15.967 --> 01:07:19.967
No, I'm starting to put it
together.

01:07:19.967 --> 01:07:24.067
What's the god damn family
secret?

01:07:24.067 --> 01:07:28.067
I don't know. There is no
secret.

01:07:28.067 --> 01:07:31.833
Fine. Play dumb. But if I find
out

01:07:31.833 --> 01:07:35.867
either one of your are involved
in this, you're both going down.

01:07:40.100 --> 01:07:41.900
What a dick. Dad are you
alright?

01:07:41.900 --> 01:07:43.900
Yeah, yeah.

01:07:43.900 --> 01:07:48.133
What is his problem? What is he
talking about? Grey haired
fruit.

01:07:48.133 --> 01:07:50.167
The other day we took a ride
and visited Papa.

01:07:50.167 --> 01:07:51.967
He thinks I blabbed to someone
about our conversation.

01:07:51.967 --> 01:07:55.967
Well, he's acting pretty
irrational. You think he could
be it?

01:07:55.967 --> 01:08:00.267
Be what? The guy who's hacking
people up into hamburger.

01:08:00.267 --> 01:08:02.200
Geno? No way. Out of the
question.

01:08:02.200 --> 01:08:04.300
Closing time. Time to go guys.

01:08:04.300 --> 01:08:08.100
We're leaving. Just give us two
minutes.

01:08:08.100 --> 01:08:12.200
(Eerie music)

01:08:12.200 --> 01:08:16.500
Fucking white trash.

01:08:20.633 --> 01:08:24.667
Hey we're closed.

01:08:24.667 --> 01:08:28.667
(Ripping)

01:08:36.832 --> 01:08:38.867
Where is that god damn cunt?

01:08:38.867 --> 01:08:40.899
Do you have to talk like that?

01:08:40.899 --> 01:08:42.733
Yes, I have to talk like that?

01:08:42.733 --> 01:08:44.767
What is that prison talk? You
were in prison right?

01:08:44.767 --> 01:08:48.832
No, I was in jail, and I talked
like I pleased there.

01:08:48.832 --> 01:08:51.100
I don't take shit from anybody,
least of all some bitch.

01:08:51.100 --> 01:08:53.167
I bet you were the bitch in
there.

01:08:53.167 --> 01:08:57.233
I bet you had a boyfriend.
Didn't you Gary.

01:08:57.233 --> 01:09:01.332
Nobody cornholed me bitch.
(Scream)

01:09:01.332 --> 01:09:05.233
(Crack)

01:09:05.233 --> 01:09:09.533
Open it! Open it!

01:09:09.533 --> 01:09:13.332
In here!

01:09:13.332 --> 01:09:17.367
What about Nelson? What about
Nelson?

01:09:17.367 --> 01:09:21.367
Nelson is on his own. He's on
his own.

01:09:21.367 --> 01:09:23.600
What kind of father are you?

01:09:23.600 --> 01:09:25.600
Shut up bitch. I'll fucking lay
you out. That granny is out
there.

01:09:25.600 --> 01:09:29.633
Shut up!

01:09:37.767 --> 01:09:41.800
Oh fuck!

01:09:41.800 --> 01:09:45.867
Fuck! Fuck!

01:09:45.867 --> 01:09:49.899
(Screaming)

01:09:49.899 --> 01:09:53.966
Come on! Come on granny fuck!

01:09:53.966 --> 01:09:58.067
Come on! (Slice)

01:09:58.067 --> 01:10:01.867
(Eerie music)

01:10:18.367 --> 01:10:22.467
What are you doing here?
Research.

01:10:22.467 --> 01:10:26.400
You want a story. I'm working
on one. Not like this you're
not.

01:10:26.400 --> 01:10:28.467
You can't just come in here and
look through anything you want.
You need clearance.

01:10:28.467 --> 01:10:30.733
You're getting as bad as
Geibner.

01:10:30.733 --> 01:10:34.600
Hey, be quiet. I just lost my
grandfather and I want to know
why.

01:10:34.600 --> 01:10:38.800
And the files here are going to
help you?

01:10:38.800 --> 01:10:42.833
You bet your fat ass they will.
Gotta be here somewhere.

01:10:42.833 --> 01:10:46.867
What exactly are you hunting
for?

01:10:46.867 --> 01:10:50.667
The old lady killer isn't the
story here. There's something
bigger.

01:10:50.667 --> 01:10:54.967
Something my family has hidden
for god knows how long.

01:10:54.967 --> 01:10:59.033
No, no, no. Geno let's not get
crazy here. We got a nut on the
loose.

01:10:59.033 --> 01:11:03.133
That's what we have. Yeah, and
that nut may be a part of whole
group of nuts.

01:11:03.133 --> 01:11:07.067
That's what I'm trying to find
out.

01:11:07.067 --> 01:11:11.267
Oh shit!

01:11:11.267 --> 01:11:15.133
Let's get the hell out of here.
I'm right behind you.

01:11:15.133 --> 01:11:19.333
(Screaming)

01:11:23.167 --> 01:11:27.367
Where the fuck were you. I've
been waiting for hours. I saw
her!

01:11:27.367 --> 01:11:31.467
I fucking saw her. Saw who? My
Nana.

01:11:31.467 --> 01:11:35.900
She's alive and well. Come on.
Sit down.

01:11:35.900 --> 01:11:37.767
Let me make you a coffee.

01:11:37.767 --> 01:11:39.833
No time for that. We have to go
to the graveyard.

01:11:39.833 --> 01:11:44.067
What? Why? I want to see my
grandmother one last time.

01:11:44.067 --> 01:11:47.933
You're crazy. You're out of
your mind.

01:11:47.933 --> 01:11:52.133
Honey, the cops are gunning for
me. I have to clear my name.

01:11:52.133 --> 01:11:56.067
Geibner is up my ass.
Carmichael was slashed to
ribbons and I was there.

01:11:56.067 --> 01:12:00.267
What do you think the cops are
gonna say. I think my
grandmother is alive,

01:12:00.267 --> 01:12:02.233
and I'm gonna prove it.

01:12:02.233 --> 01:12:04.067
How are you gonna do that?

01:12:04.067 --> 01:12:08.133
If she's in the coffin, then
it's not her running around
with the blade.

01:12:08.133 --> 01:12:12.233
But if she's not, she either
cheated death or the devil sent
her back to earth.

01:12:12.233 --> 01:12:16.300
Come on. Let's go.

01:12:16.300 --> 01:12:20.367
Jesus. Dwyer, you let that son
of a bitch go and now look what
happened.

01:12:20.367 --> 01:12:22.600
Fucking bloodbath. Calm down.

01:12:22.600 --> 01:12:24.600
Don't tell me to calm down. He
just butchered

01:12:24.600 --> 01:12:26.633
ten more people.

01:12:26.633 --> 01:12:28.433
That bowling alley looks like a
butcher's shop.

01:12:28.433 --> 01:12:30.733
No, I'm taking him down
tonight.

01:12:30.733 --> 01:12:32.633
You're not doing anything. Sit
down and shut the fuck up.

01:12:32.633 --> 01:12:34.833
Who the fuck do you think
you're talking to?

01:12:34.833 --> 01:12:36.633
You. Now sit down. Let's talk.

01:12:36.633 --> 01:12:40.667
No, there's no time. There's no
fucking time.

01:12:40.667 --> 01:12:42.933
What kind of ring is that? It's
a ring.

01:12:42.933 --> 01:12:45.067
I like the design.

01:12:45.067 --> 01:12:49.067
Now let's think this out here
Adams. No.

01:12:49.067 --> 01:12:53.400
Forget it. You think it out.
I'm going to go take care of
this.

01:13:01.567 --> 01:13:03.900
Well, here it is. Hold the
flashlight please honey.

01:13:03.900 --> 01:13:05.800
This is illegal Geno.

01:13:05.800 --> 01:13:10.233
It's a lot less years for this
then what they got pinned on me.

01:13:10.233 --> 01:13:14.267
Please just hold the
flashlight.

01:13:22.367 --> 01:13:26.200
I'm cold.

01:13:26.200 --> 01:13:28.433
Relax honey. I'm almost there.

01:13:28.433 --> 01:13:30.467
I want to thank you for this
romantic evening.

01:13:30.467 --> 01:13:34.267
Hey, if I don't figure this
shit out,

01:13:34.267 --> 01:13:38.533
I will have plenty of romantic
evenings behind bars. Now, just
give me a minute.

01:13:38.533 --> 01:13:42.533
(Thudding)

01:13:42.533 --> 01:13:46.600
Jesus! Jesus!

01:13:46.600 --> 01:13:50.667
I told you! I told you! They
buried an empty coffin.

01:13:50.667 --> 01:13:54.733
I told you! There has to be a
logical explanation for this.

01:13:54.733 --> 01:13:58.800
Yeah, there is. Nana's alive
and the bitch has snapped.

01:14:02.667 --> 01:14:06.867
What's the plan now? I got to
figure this shit out.

01:14:06.867 --> 01:14:10.967
That's the plan. I want to know
why my Nana faked her own death.

01:14:10.967 --> 01:14:14.867
When I figure that out, the
rest of this will just fall
into place.

01:14:14.867 --> 01:14:17.100
I'm gonna find out what's going
on here and when I do,

01:14:17.100 --> 01:14:19.133
everyone involved is gonna go
down like dominos.

01:14:19.133 --> 01:14:23.233
You're a writer. That's all.

01:14:23.233 --> 01:14:27.400
You're not a crime fighter.
Just go to the cops.

01:14:27.400 --> 01:14:29.267
Why? So they can say I stole my
Nana's corpse.

01:14:29.267 --> 01:14:31.567
Come on. They're idiots.

01:14:31.567 --> 01:14:33.367
They're looking for someone to
blame and they're focused on me.

01:14:33.367 --> 01:14:35.633
I'm guilty until proven
innocent.

01:14:35.633 --> 01:14:39.700
You should have stuck with
covering high school softball.

01:14:43.767 --> 01:14:47.667
Wasn't in there, was she?

01:14:47.667 --> 01:14:51.733
No she wasn't. I just cracked
the case. You're in danger.

01:14:51.733 --> 01:14:56.067
Get in the car. I need you to
jump in. Both of you.

01:14:56.067 --> 01:15:00.233
Alright, let's go.

01:15:00.233 --> 01:15:04.267
Looks like your Nana faked her
own death and she's on an all
out killing spree.

01:15:04.267 --> 01:15:06.333
There's more and you know that
detective. Yes.

01:15:06.333 --> 01:15:08.400
There's evidence of cult
activity.

01:15:08.400 --> 01:15:12.533
But I found out where they're
meeting tonight,

01:15:12.533 --> 01:15:16.433
and we are gonna crash they
party. Us and what army?

01:15:16.433 --> 01:15:18.733
Don't worry about it. I got a
shotgun.

01:15:18.733 --> 01:15:20.567
I didn't want to get anyone
involved that we can't trust.

01:15:20.567 --> 01:15:24.733
I don't know how widespread
this cult is.

01:15:24.733 --> 01:15:28.867
(Knocking) What's that? What's
that noise?

01:15:28.867 --> 01:15:33.233
I don't hear anything. There's
a thumping in the trunk.

01:15:33.233 --> 01:15:37.300
I got a bowling ball back
there. It's rolling around.
It's what you're hearing.

01:15:37.300 --> 01:15:41.200
What's your name there darling?
Danielle.

01:15:41.200 --> 01:15:45.467
Well, Danielle.

01:15:45.467 --> 01:15:47.467
I'm gonna need you to stay in
the car while your hubby

01:15:47.467 --> 01:15:49.633
and I take care of business.
Understood?

01:15:49.633 --> 01:15:53.800
Yeah.

01:16:06.333 --> 01:16:10.400
(Slam)

01:16:10.400 --> 01:16:14.233
This doesn't feel right. Trust
me, will you?

01:16:14.233 --> 01:16:18.500
Let's kick some ass.

01:16:22.533 --> 01:16:26.600
(Eerie music)

01:16:30.633 --> 01:16:34.700
(Slam)

01:16:38.833 --> 01:16:42.733
(Eerie music)

01:16:46.933 --> 01:16:50.967
Oh shit. Fuck.

01:16:50.967 --> 01:16:54.767
Oh fuck.

01:17:07.167 --> 01:17:11.200
Who the fuck are you?

01:17:11.200 --> 01:17:15.600
The man asked you a question.

01:17:19.700 --> 01:17:23.700
Scott?

01:17:23.700 --> 01:17:28.100
Surprised? Thanks for bringing
him here.

01:17:28.100 --> 01:17:32.100
You're in on this too? Geno,
you're not dead.

01:17:32.100 --> 01:17:36.133
There's a reason for that. Be
happy.

01:17:36.133 --> 01:17:39.933
People are dying. They're
dropping like flies and you
want me to be happy?

01:17:39.933 --> 01:17:44.133
Just come to our meeting. It's
starting in a couple minutes.
Fuck you.

01:17:44.133 --> 01:17:48.167
You think it's loaded?

01:17:48.167 --> 01:17:52.300
You are too much. (Knocking)
I'll get that.

01:17:56.133 --> 01:18:00.433
Just listen to them honey.

01:18:00.433 --> 01:18:04.400
No, not you. You wanted to know
the secret.

01:18:04.400 --> 01:18:08.433
And you are gonna find out and
you'll be glad that you did.

01:18:08.433 --> 01:18:12.467
You told these sons of bitches
that we went to visit my
grandfather.

01:18:12.467 --> 01:18:16.500
It wasn't Nelson. It was you
god dammit.

01:18:16.500 --> 01:18:20.567
We're wasting time here. Follow
me Geno. Learn something.

01:18:20.567 --> 01:18:24.600
Oh, so you like dressing like a
woman, huh, Scott?

01:18:24.600 --> 01:18:28.600
I thought you were a man's man.
I do what's best for the family.

01:18:28.600 --> 01:18:32.633
Dressing like a drag queen.
That's what's best for the
family?

01:18:32.633 --> 01:18:36.433
Silence. Silence? You sound
like a fucking asshole.

01:18:36.433 --> 01:18:40.667
I wish I never went to that
party.

01:18:44.733 --> 01:18:48.767
(Eerie music)

01:19:01.067 --> 01:19:04.900
Three thousand years ago it
began,

01:19:04.900 --> 01:19:09.167
and tonight we celebrate the
addition of a new member of our
group.

01:19:09.167 --> 01:19:13.200
Tonight will be night of
sacrifice and rebirth.

01:19:13.200 --> 01:19:17.300
What are you? Fucking
Satanists? No. Just listen.

01:19:17.300 --> 01:19:21.400
Geno McGee is with us tonight.

01:19:21.400 --> 01:19:25.500
Although he may not realize
this. He shares our philosophy.

01:19:25.500 --> 01:19:27.367
He's ambitious and driven and
he has discovered our existence,

01:19:27.367 --> 01:19:29.633
which is not an easy thing to
do.

01:19:29.633 --> 01:19:33.533
Geno.

01:19:33.533 --> 01:19:37.867
We have had our eye on you for
a long, long time.

01:19:37.867 --> 01:19:39.933
Being so observant, I'm quite
surprised that you haven't
realized

01:19:39.933 --> 01:19:42.067
that we have been with you all
along.

01:19:42.067 --> 01:19:45.933
From the time ou were born. To
your marriage.

01:19:45.933 --> 01:19:50.067
To now. It is now your time
Geno. Your time to realize your
destiny.

01:19:50.067 --> 01:19:54.400
So Rod.

01:19:54.400 --> 01:19:56.200
What you're telling me, my
whole life has been arranged by
you

01:19:56.200 --> 01:19:58.400
and this group of misfits.

01:19:58.400 --> 01:20:02.433
This group of misfits, as you
call them,

01:20:02.433 --> 01:20:06.233
is part of a much larger
society that rules the world.

01:20:06.233 --> 01:20:08.433
That rules the world Geno.

01:20:08.433 --> 01:20:10.433
All of the world leaders are
told what to do

01:20:10.433 --> 01:20:14.433
and when to do it by us. To
answer your question,

01:20:14.433 --> 01:20:18.467
we have made life easier for
you. Mentoring you and molding
you.

01:20:18.467 --> 01:20:22.267
You have had a good life. You
have a home.

01:20:22.267 --> 01:20:26.467
A wife and a good job.

01:20:26.467 --> 01:20:30.500
Now things will be much, much
easier if you allow it to.

01:20:30.500 --> 01:20:34.300
So, what do I gotta do? Wear a
robe and worship an owl?

01:20:34.300 --> 01:20:38.500
Why do you simplify everything?

01:20:38.500 --> 01:20:42.533
Many have misunderstood us for
thousands of years.

01:20:42.533 --> 01:20:46.533
(Groaning)

01:20:46.533 --> 01:20:50.533
Now Geno.

01:20:50.533 --> 01:20:54.567
To become one of us, you must
make a sacrifice to Moloch.

01:20:58.567 --> 01:21:02.600
Detective Adams has been a
thorn in our side

01:21:02.600 --> 01:21:06.600
for quite some time. And now,
Geno, your future is now.

01:21:06.600 --> 01:21:10.733
Kill him! Honey please. It's a
great opportunity

01:21:10.733 --> 01:21:14.867
for us. You want to become a
world famous writer and this is
your chance.

01:21:14.867 --> 01:21:18.900
Write a book about the granny
killer. It's part of the reason

01:21:18.900 --> 01:21:22.933
for this ridiculous get up. All
the pieces are in place for us
to be great.

01:21:22.933 --> 01:21:26.867
I used to think we were great.

01:21:26.867 --> 01:21:31.100
But it would have never been
enough for you, would it?

01:21:31.100 --> 01:21:35.100
Look at me! I have a fucking
knife in my hand,

01:21:35.100 --> 01:21:39.067
and you're cool with me
stabbing this guy and joining
this sick group.

01:21:39.067 --> 01:21:43.100
It's for the good. They're not
sick. People die every day.

01:21:43.100 --> 01:21:47.400
They die the streets and in
bullshit wars. Those deaths are
meaningless.

01:21:47.400 --> 01:21:51.200
This one means something to the
both of us.

01:21:51.200 --> 01:21:55.533
Remember when you told me that
you wanted to rule the world?
Now you can.

01:21:55.533 --> 01:21:59.333
Literally. Dammit, you know I
didn't mean literally.

01:21:59.333 --> 01:22:03.533
I thought you had more heart
than this.

01:22:03.533 --> 01:22:07.667
I really did.

01:22:07.667 --> 01:22:11.800
You said the reason we don't
talk anymore was become of Sam.

01:22:11.800 --> 01:22:15.800
Sam is gone now. Now we can be
a real brother and sister again.

01:22:15.800 --> 01:22:19.733
No. I don't want the blood on
my hands. It's not worth it.

01:22:19.733 --> 01:22:24.067
None of its worth it. I'm going
to the FBI.

01:22:24.067 --> 01:22:28.200
The FBI works for us.

01:22:28.200 --> 01:22:32.333
Now, make your choice. Join us!

01:22:32.333 --> 01:22:36.467
Geno, this is a golden
opportunity for you.

01:22:36.467 --> 01:22:40.467
You look good for a dead man
Carmichael. I had to do
something.

01:22:40.467 --> 01:22:42.533
Didn't expect my golden boy to
show up and pawing through the
files.

01:22:42.533 --> 01:22:48.633
Once Scott showed up, I had to
do something. Make your choice!

01:22:48.633 --> 01:22:52.633
Join us.

01:22:52.633 --> 01:22:56.633
Fuck you.

01:23:00.667 --> 01:23:04.733
(Groaning)

01:23:04.733 --> 01:23:08.733
Jesus christ. What the fuck?

01:23:08.733 --> 01:23:12.633
(Stabbing)

01:23:16.900 --> 01:23:20.700
(Muffled screaming)

01:23:28.967 --> 01:23:32.767
Kill him! Kill him! Kill him!

01:23:37.067 --> 01:23:40.800
(Groaning)

01:23:44.867 --> 01:23:48.900
(Cracking)

01:23:53.100 --> 01:23:57.167
What are we gonna do? Continue
with the plan.

01:23:57.167 --> 01:24:01.200
What if goes to the FBI? Let's
get back to the meeting.

01:24:01.200 --> 01:24:05.233
He cannot run forever.

01:24:09.067 --> 01:24:13.333
(Groaning)

01:24:21.400 --> 01:24:25.400
(Thud)

01:24:29.233 --> 01:24:33.500
I'm filing for divorce.

01:24:33.500 --> 01:24:37.700
(Rustling)

01:24:49.867 --> 01:24:53.867
(Banging)

01:25:01.967 --> 01:25:06.333
(Engine)

01:25:18.633 --> 01:25:22.700
I'm Agent Rivera. Sorry to keep
you waiting. No problem.

01:25:22.700 --> 01:25:26.600
Read your statement.

01:25:26.600 --> 01:25:30.833
It is something else. You've
had quite a night now.

01:25:30.833 --> 01:25:32.900
You could say that.

01:25:32.900 --> 01:25:34.733
I did some research on this
Moloch character. Very
interesting.

01:25:34.733 --> 01:25:38.833
Some people believe the
Clintons, the Bushes,

01:25:38.833 --> 01:25:41.100
and every other world leader
worship that damn thing.

01:25:41.100 --> 01:25:43.167
Imagine that. Worshipping an
owl.

01:25:43.167 --> 01:25:47.200
Meet at this place called the
Bohemian Grove,

01:25:47.200 --> 01:25:49.200
and now they meet at a small
town, Ludlow.

01:25:49.200 --> 01:25:51.200
Next time you go to one of
these places,

01:25:51.200 --> 01:25:53.067
say hi to Bill Clinton to me.
You need to lighten up.

01:25:53.067 --> 01:25:55.200
Lighten up?

01:25:55.200 --> 01:25:59.200
How many more bodies need to
pile up before you want me to
take this seriously?

01:25:59.200 --> 01:26:03.067
I'm sorry Geno. The story is so
sensational.

01:26:03.067 --> 01:26:07.367
It's tough to digest. Maybe it
would be easier if you went up

01:26:07.367 --> 01:26:11.433
to that cabin and made some
arrests. Here's my question.

01:26:11.433 --> 01:26:15.500
Your uncle said that this
organization ruled the world.

01:26:15.500 --> 01:26:17.333
All the richest and most
powerful men and women were
part of it.

01:26:17.333 --> 01:26:19.567
Why is your uncle part of it?

01:26:19.567 --> 01:26:23.433
He makes less than I do. It's
not about money Rivera.

01:26:23.433 --> 01:26:27.667
It's about usefulness I think.

01:26:27.667 --> 01:26:31.533
There's people from all walks
of life involved in this. In
all different levels.

01:26:31.533 --> 01:26:35.633
My uncle even said that the FBI
was involved.

01:26:35.633 --> 01:26:39.967
Really? Why don't you tell me
what else your uncle said?

01:26:39.967 --> 01:26:43.867
(Metal music)

01:26:51.867 --> 01:27:29.900
(Metal music)

01:27:29.900 --> 01:28:07.900
(Metal music)

01:29:24.067 --> 01:30:02.233
(Metal music)
