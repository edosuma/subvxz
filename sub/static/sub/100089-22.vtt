00:06.492 --> 00:08.851
- Oh, my gaaaah!
- Oh, my gaaaah!

00:08.914 --> 00:11.314
- What the ass?!
- Oh, my gah!

00:12.574 --> 00:13.616
Okay.

00:13.685 --> 00:15.418
We're just two people in the morning

00:15.487 --> 00:17.420
who had pizza and chicken wings
the night previous.

00:17.522 --> 00:18.873
- Yes. Yes, we are.
- Yeah.

00:18.964 --> 00:20.396
And everything about that is fine!

00:20.425 --> 00:22.091
Double that. We are double fine.

00:22.131 --> 00:23.159
- Yeah.
- We are grand.

00:23.261 --> 00:24.928
- So good.
- Good as wood.

00:24.953 --> 00:25.862
Good morning...

00:25.931 --> 00:27.263
- Grand morning!
- Wood morning!

00:27.332 --> 00:29.461
We just came to see you off to Barstow.

00:29.534 --> 00:32.871
And can I just say that I am
loving the energy in this room.

00:32.934 --> 00:34.237
Like, it is wild.

00:34.306 --> 00:36.072
- Yeah, everything is normal.
- Mm-hmm.

00:36.107 --> 00:38.074
Sophie and Graham are off at space camp.

00:38.143 --> 00:40.243
So, we're alone, but it's normal.

00:40.268 --> 00:41.288
Normal.

00:41.313 --> 00:42.845
- What is...
- Hello.

00:42.870 --> 00:43.823
- Grand!
- Wood!

00:43.848 --> 00:45.248
- ...happening?
- Now I'm here!

00:45.317 --> 00:47.050
You guys would not believe
my morning so far.

00:47.152 --> 00:48.184
I gots a muffin!

00:48.253 --> 00:49.719
I bet that's all we talk about today.

00:49.788 --> 00:51.588
Uh, Poppy, can we speak
over in the corner?

00:51.613 --> 00:52.566
Yeas.

00:52.591 --> 00:53.790
Uh, kids, go to Graham's room.

00:53.815 --> 00:54.901
And do what?

00:54.926 --> 00:56.125
I don't know, mess with his stuff.

00:56.194 --> 00:57.160
What happened last night?

00:57.229 --> 00:58.194
Don't know.

00:58.263 --> 00:59.829
Uh, Will and I were drinking wine,

00:59.931 --> 01:01.331
and then we ordered pizza
to the neighbor's house

01:01.433 --> 01:03.366
since they won't come
to mine anymore, and then...

01:03.468 --> 01:04.434
that's all I got!

01:04.501 --> 01:05.668
I don't remember a thing.

01:05.737 --> 01:07.303
We were eating our seventh plate
of chicken wings,

01:07.405 --> 01:08.404
and then we woke up together!

01:08.506 --> 01:09.572
Is this gonna be a whole thing now?

01:09.641 --> 01:11.507
Because I just came by
to give D'Amato her mail

01:11.576 --> 01:12.809
that keeps coming to my sauna.

01:12.877 --> 01:14.911
You don't understand. We were...

01:15.013 --> 01:15.979
Cuddling.

01:16.047 --> 01:17.447
I mean, we still had all our clothes on,

01:17.515 --> 01:18.648
so nothing too crazy happened.

01:18.750 --> 01:20.149
But it was intimate.

01:20.252 --> 01:22.252
Intimant?
Is there a second "N" in there?

01:22.320 --> 01:23.386
It's "Internet."

01:24.623 --> 01:26.589
Okay, in every cuddle,
there's a cuddlee and a cuddler.

01:26.691 --> 01:27.757
So, which one were you?

01:27.859 --> 01:29.092
I don't know. I just woke up.

01:29.194 --> 01:30.159
I might still be drunk.

01:30.228 --> 01:32.095
I am definitely still drunk.

01:32.163 --> 01:33.396
And any minute, Derek is gonna...

01:33.498 --> 01:35.531
Hey, Ang. You ready to go to...

01:36.342 --> 01:37.367
...Barstow?

01:39.404 --> 01:40.647
Ya-guh!

01:44.075 --> 01:45.975
- Grand morning!
- Wood morning!

01:46.077 --> 01:47.477
Hello...

01:47.579 --> 01:48.845
everyone.

01:59.824 --> 02:01.424
Remember Pogs?

02:02.980 --> 02:03.993
Everything okay?

02:04.095 --> 02:06.129
Absolutely! Uh, we...

02:06.231 --> 02:08.564
I just got so excited to pack
that I forgot to pack!

02:08.667 --> 02:10.098
Uh, Poppy, will you help me pack?

02:10.201 --> 02:11.434
- Yeah.
- My bedroom, please.

02:11.536 --> 02:12.468
Yeah.

02:12.570 --> 02:14.370
And, uh, Will, uh, Douglas, Miggy,

02:14.422 --> 02:15.476
will you clean up the kitchen?!

02:15.571 --> 02:17.373
And, um, Derek,

02:17.475 --> 02:19.542
can you...

02:19.644 --> 02:22.078
help Amy and Emma untangle
my rubber bands?

02:22.180 --> 02:23.513
W-Who are Emma and Amy?

02:23.615 --> 02:25.982
- Who are you?
- Oh. I'm Graham's dad.

02:26.084 --> 02:28.084
The blueberry scientist?

02:28.186 --> 02:29.385
If this guy's a scientist,

02:29.487 --> 02:31.154
I'm the Queen of France.

02:31.256 --> 02:32.955
Just untangle my rubber bands!

02:33.058 --> 02:34.357
And what can I do?

02:34.459 --> 02:35.458
Oh, my God.

02:35.560 --> 02:37.393
Angie's door has become
a people factory.

02:37.495 --> 02:38.928
- Who is this?
- I'm Jared.

02:39.030 --> 02:40.730
- This is Jared.
- There's a Jared now?

02:40.832 --> 02:42.398
He's my new friend from Craigslist.

02:42.500 --> 02:44.934
He's subletting my place for the summer.

02:45.036 --> 02:46.903
You're really helping me out, Jared.

02:47.839 --> 02:48.938
Angie!

02:49.040 --> 02:50.106
Don't give me that look!

02:50.208 --> 02:51.908
I can have fun.

02:52.010 --> 02:53.576
Rory, sweetheart,

02:53.678 --> 02:55.144
can you take Jared to Graham's room,

02:55.246 --> 02:56.279
help him get settled in?

02:56.381 --> 02:58.181
Sounds like a totally normal kid job.

02:58.283 --> 02:59.415
Right this way.

03:11.529 --> 03:14.230
Derek can definitely tell
something is up!

03:14.332 --> 03:16.999
God, I'm supposed to spend
the summer with that hot dummy!

03:17.102 --> 03:19.001
How am I gonna do that if I'm obsessing

03:19.104 --> 03:21.237
over what did or didn't happen
with Will?

03:21.339 --> 03:24.173
Well, what if something
did happen with Will?

03:24.259 --> 03:25.528
Well, I'd have to rethink everything!

03:25.606 --> 03:26.776
Ang? A mo?

03:26.801 --> 03:27.821
- Hi.
- Hi.

03:27.846 --> 03:28.945
Uh, you know how you left me alone

03:29.013 --> 03:30.213
in a room with a strange man

03:30.315 --> 03:32.548
and my mom said absolutely nothing?

03:32.650 --> 03:33.649
Yeah?

03:33.718 --> 03:34.951
Well, there's three more of them now.

03:35.019 --> 03:37.053
Ohhhh! Yeah. That one's on me.

03:37.155 --> 03:39.922
I, uh, cast a wide net online
for hot male subletters,

03:40.024 --> 03:41.691
and I told the first four
they could have it.

03:41.760 --> 03:43.092
I just figured most of them would flake.

03:43.161 --> 03:44.827
Your post specifically said "hot men"?

03:44.929 --> 03:45.928
You're not even gonna be here!

03:46.030 --> 03:48.097
I will not explain myself further.

03:48.166 --> 03:50.533
You know what?
Do me a solid... go pick one.

03:50.602 --> 03:52.135
Make a big financial decision

03:52.237 --> 03:54.170
that will directly impact your future?

03:55.173 --> 03:56.372
Yeah, no, I think I can do that.

03:56.474 --> 03:57.507
He's a gem.

03:58.610 --> 04:01.010
Okay. What's the last thing
you remember?

04:01.112 --> 04:02.211
Uh...

04:02.313 --> 04:04.814
the power went out,
and then we lit some candles,

04:04.883 --> 04:06.816
opened a bottle of wine.

04:06.885 --> 04:08.384
Okay. Back to the candles.

04:08.453 --> 04:09.819
Were they your holiday ones
from the gas station?

04:09.921 --> 04:10.853
Of course!

04:10.922 --> 04:12.355
Ohh, God. You know me so well.

04:12.424 --> 04:13.723
Oh, my God. This is why we work.

04:13.825 --> 04:14.824
This is why we get each other.

04:14.926 --> 04:15.892
Okay, focus! Focus.

04:15.960 --> 04:17.793
Good thing is, scent triggers memory.

04:17.896 --> 04:18.928
Which ones did you use?

04:18.997 --> 04:20.062
All of them.

04:20.130 --> 04:22.532
Like, at different times.
It was candle jazz.

04:22.634 --> 04:24.100
All right, all we have to do is

04:24.202 --> 04:26.402
re-create the exact
combination of scents,

04:26.504 --> 04:27.904
and that memory will come back to you.

04:28.006 --> 04:29.238
- Bring me the candles.
- Fine!

04:29.307 --> 04:30.840
And do you mind packing up my suitcase?

04:30.942 --> 04:32.308
That torn trash bag in the corner?

04:33.378 --> 04:34.644
Yeah.

04:34.712 --> 04:36.345
I don't know what happened,
but based off the feelings

04:36.448 --> 04:37.980
- I've been having, I-I...
- What feelings?

04:38.082 --> 04:39.282
Will has feelings for Angie.

04:39.307 --> 04:40.293
- What?
- Yeah.

04:40.318 --> 04:42.018
I can see pheromones in the air,

04:42.086 --> 04:44.320
and Will has been looking gooey
for a while.

04:44.389 --> 04:46.422
You do look a little gooey,
and that suggests to me

04:46.491 --> 04:48.191
that you were definitely the cuddler.

04:48.293 --> 04:49.992
- Mm-hmm.
- Oh, no. Poor Angie.

04:50.094 --> 04:51.227
Just trying to get some shut-eye,

04:51.329 --> 04:53.229
and in comes ol' cuddlin' Will

04:53.331 --> 04:55.331
with his cuddlin' arms
and his cuddly legs,

04:55.400 --> 04:56.866
looking for a good old time!

04:56.968 --> 04:58.468
Oh, she probably hates me!

04:58.493 --> 04:59.572
It's better that way.

04:59.619 --> 05:02.104
Getting involved with anyone
in the friend group is a fiasco.

05:02.207 --> 05:03.506
- Look at me and Poppy.
- You're right!

05:03.608 --> 05:05.508
Angie's my best friend,
and I made it weird.

05:05.577 --> 05:07.743
I have to apologize to her
for the cuddle.

05:07.846 --> 05:08.778
- Hey, Will.
- Derek!

05:08.880 --> 05:09.879
Oh-doh!

05:09.981 --> 05:10.980
Can you help me pack the car?

05:11.082 --> 05:12.882
Um... can the twins do it?

05:12.984 --> 05:14.484
They're always looking
to build up their lats.

05:14.552 --> 05:15.952
No. I want it to be you.

05:16.020 --> 05:17.720
I have some questions about last night.

05:17.822 --> 05:19.589
Okay.

05:19.691 --> 05:21.290
I like that b-dery much.

05:23.361 --> 05:25.127
That young man is gonna kill him.

05:25.196 --> 05:27.230
How did things get so complicated?

05:27.298 --> 05:29.732
First, you and Poppy break up.
Now Will and Angie.

05:29.834 --> 05:32.435
My phone updated against my will
in the middle of the night.

05:32.460 --> 05:35.004
- Hey, uh, Miggy?
- I can't handle anything else.

05:35.073 --> 05:38.174
I... just need help picking out
a hunky subletter for Angie.

05:38.243 --> 05:39.575
Oh, your thing has hunks?

05:41.346 --> 05:42.912
Pleasure to meet you.

05:43.014 --> 05:45.081
Oh, Miggy way in.

05:46.951 --> 05:48.184
Nothing.

05:48.286 --> 05:49.485
Nothing.

05:51.222 --> 05:52.822
Wait! I'm getting something.

05:54.025 --> 05:56.325
The scent of eggnog reminds me of...

05:56.427 --> 05:58.194
Yes? Yes?

05:59.797 --> 06:01.468
The eggnog candle reminds me of eggnog!

06:01.533 --> 06:03.499
Well, I see how you got there.

06:03.601 --> 06:04.634
God!

06:04.702 --> 06:07.036
I'm never gonna remember
how the cuddle happened!

06:07.138 --> 06:08.971
It's no use. Let's just blow these out.

06:10.675 --> 06:12.008
Ah!

06:12.110 --> 06:13.276
My snowman candle

06:13.378 --> 06:15.778
smells just like
disappointing Christmas morning.

06:15.803 --> 06:16.779
Mmm!

06:19.050 --> 06:21.217
♪ I'll meet you right here ♪

06:21.319 --> 06:23.920
♪ I'll meet you right here ♪

06:24.022 --> 06:25.855
"Ham" for three points!

06:25.957 --> 06:27.957
I eat ham!

06:29.227 --> 06:31.594
I feel so beautiful right now.

06:31.696 --> 06:34.363
- Should I be an artist?
- Yeah.

06:34.465 --> 06:36.365
- Ready? Go!
- Whoa!

06:36.467 --> 06:38.434
- Wow!
- I'm Angie!

06:38.536 --> 06:39.535
Whoa!

06:39.637 --> 06:40.670
It's uncanny.

06:43.174 --> 06:44.774
You sure you're okay on the floor?

06:44.842 --> 06:46.242
You mean my nest?

06:46.344 --> 06:47.243
It's comfy.

06:47.345 --> 06:48.277
Aww.

06:48.346 --> 06:50.012
I feel like a little baby bird.

06:53.451 --> 06:54.417
Aw, man.

06:54.485 --> 06:55.585
Left one lit.

06:55.687 --> 06:57.553
I'm not burning this house down again.

07:08.032 --> 07:08.931
Ang?

07:09.033 --> 07:10.399
What's happening?

07:10.501 --> 07:11.921
Oh, God! Is it too many candles?

07:11.976 --> 07:13.202
Should we call poison control?

07:22.703 --> 07:23.946
Good night, Will.

07:25.049 --> 07:26.786
Good night, Angie.

07:26.841 --> 07:28.818
It was me.

07:28.843 --> 07:30.049
I was the cuddler.

07:30.110 --> 07:32.721
Ooh! Poppy's scandalized.

07:33.370 --> 07:35.385
I'm done drinking... forever!

07:35.458 --> 07:37.737
Except for weekends and holidays
and my birthday and Mondays,

07:37.816 --> 07:39.282
because Mondays are hard, you know!

07:39.351 --> 07:41.651
Okay, stop talking
like a nightshirt on Etsy!

07:41.676 --> 07:42.808
Does Will remember?

07:42.834 --> 07:44.133
I don't know.

07:44.231 --> 07:45.288
What if he does?

07:45.390 --> 07:46.789
What if I've ruined our friendship

07:46.858 --> 07:48.892
and... and he doesn't even
feel the same way?

07:48.960 --> 07:51.427
Wait, feel the same way...

07:51.496 --> 07:53.263
as you feel?!

07:53.331 --> 07:56.266
- How do you feel exactly?
- I don't know, Poppy.

07:56.334 --> 07:58.168
God!

07:58.270 --> 08:00.203
I mean, it's Will.

08:00.272 --> 08:02.805
He... He sneaks greens
into my morning cereal,

08:02.874 --> 08:04.507
like he's Jessica Seinfeld!

08:04.609 --> 08:06.543
But then sometimes,

08:06.611 --> 08:07.644
I feel like maybe...

08:07.712 --> 08:09.078
Yeah?

08:10.849 --> 08:12.315
Oh, my God. Oh, my... Oh, my God.

08:12.417 --> 08:13.416
Okay. Okay.

08:13.485 --> 08:15.351
Angie, you got to talk to him.

08:15.453 --> 08:17.787
No! I'm not doing this, okay?

08:17.856 --> 08:20.323
Grab a garbage bag and start
throwing stuff in there!

08:20.392 --> 08:21.925
Off to Barstow!

08:25.263 --> 08:27.463
I'm just trying to figure out
what Angie was doing last night.

08:27.532 --> 08:28.998
I mean, she's barely packed,

08:29.067 --> 08:30.600
nobody will look me in the eye,

08:30.669 --> 08:31.901
which is making me very self-conscious

08:32.003 --> 08:33.436
because I had a style last week.

08:33.505 --> 08:34.837
I wouldn't read into it.

08:34.905 --> 08:36.506
Uh, there was a blackout last night.

08:36.575 --> 08:38.841
- There was a blackout?
- Yeah, but Angie had candles,

08:38.909 --> 08:40.243
- so we lit those, and...
- Wait.

08:40.312 --> 08:42.879
So, you two were alone
together... in candlelight?

08:42.948 --> 08:44.080
It's not what you think.

08:44.149 --> 08:45.848
We were just eating
chicken wings and hanging out.

08:45.951 --> 08:47.750
It was so boring, we fell asleep.

08:47.775 --> 08:48.828
Wait, you slept here?

08:48.853 --> 08:51.254
More like passed out
'cause we were so drunk.

08:51.356 --> 08:53.269
Can I please start over?

08:54.392 --> 08:55.792
...like, let's throw 'em back,
throw 'em back...

08:56.895 --> 08:58.261
We got to get Will away from Derek

08:58.363 --> 09:00.170
and over to Angie.

09:00.201 --> 09:01.231
Hey.

09:01.299 --> 09:03.700
I think Angie likes Will.

09:04.669 --> 09:05.768
Angie likes Will?

09:05.870 --> 09:07.403
- Will likes Angie!
- Shut up!

09:07.472 --> 09:09.272
What has happened to me?
I used to be a man!

09:09.341 --> 09:10.840
Ooh! It's so exciting, right?

09:10.909 --> 09:11.975
Those poor kids.

09:12.043 --> 09:14.644
I warned him not to date
within the friend group.

09:14.713 --> 09:16.613
We had to learn that the hard way.

09:16.715 --> 09:19.182
Hey. I have no regrets.

09:20.352 --> 09:21.451
Fine.

09:21.519 --> 09:23.553
Let's go rescue Lollipop Boy.

09:23.622 --> 09:24.988
That's right. I still say it.

09:25.090 --> 09:26.389
Girls!

09:26.458 --> 09:28.124
I gotta say,

09:28.226 --> 09:30.193
this whole thing sounds pretty sketchy.

09:30.262 --> 09:32.762
And this is coming from a guy who
once called the cops on himself.

09:32.864 --> 09:33.997
Will, go inside.

09:34.065 --> 09:36.266
Need you to sit on
an over-packed suitcase.

09:36.334 --> 09:37.634
Thank you.

09:37.702 --> 09:39.102
So, Derek, Amy and Emma...

09:39.170 --> 09:42.005
they're gonna give your vehicle
a full diagnostic inspection,

09:42.073 --> 09:43.840
make sure you get back
to Barstow safely.

09:43.875 --> 09:46.776
Oh, thanks, sir, but my Honda's
brand-new. It runs great.

09:46.845 --> 09:48.811
Yeah. The girls are gonna
look at your car, Derek.

09:48.880 --> 09:50.980
Okay, Derek, time to leave now.

09:51.049 --> 09:52.048
Oh, sorry. We can't.

09:52.150 --> 09:54.083
These nice ladies
are gonna fix the Honda.

09:54.152 --> 09:56.052
- Pop 'er open.
- Got it.

09:56.154 --> 09:57.587
No, uh, we're going now.

09:57.656 --> 09:59.389
We'll take my van. Start loading bags.

09:59.457 --> 10:01.124
- What's the hurry?
- Move!

10:01.192 --> 10:02.158
Will. Can I have a mo?

10:02.260 --> 10:03.326
I honestly do not have a mo...

10:03.395 --> 10:04.360
Overruled! I'm taking a mo.

10:04.462 --> 10:05.561
I'm looking for Angie.

10:05.630 --> 10:07.130
Do you realize what I'm about to do?

10:07.198 --> 10:09.666
I'm gonna cross party lines
and share Angie's secrets.

10:09.734 --> 10:10.767
I know.

10:10.835 --> 10:12.001
That's girl-on-girl crime.

10:12.103 --> 10:13.970
I'm a traitor to my own country!

10:14.039 --> 10:15.872
- Angie's your country?
- Yes!

10:15.940 --> 10:18.207
She's my best friend,
and that makes her my country.

10:18.276 --> 10:20.243
And I want what's best for my country.

10:20.345 --> 10:21.811
So here goes.

10:21.913 --> 10:23.012
We talked about last night...

10:23.081 --> 10:24.480
Shhhhhhh!

10:24.549 --> 10:27.150
You are either helping
with this hunk problem

10:27.185 --> 10:30.520
or you're sitting and reading
quietly to yourself!

10:30.622 --> 10:31.621
Get in here!

10:32.757 --> 10:34.386
Will, I think she has feelings for you.

10:34.411 --> 10:35.447
No!

10:35.472 --> 10:37.360
Wait, what?! Hold on.

10:37.385 --> 10:38.505
No!

10:38.530 --> 10:39.762
Wait. What?

10:39.831 --> 10:41.531
No! Wait. What?

10:41.599 --> 10:42.598
I don't have time for this, okay?

10:42.667 --> 10:43.700
- We are on a clock.
- Right.

10:43.768 --> 10:44.901
W-What did she say?

10:45.003 --> 10:46.669
Nothing. You know, I-I-I just know her.

10:46.771 --> 10:49.272
I know when she pretends
to like Taylor Swift ironically

10:49.374 --> 10:50.573
but she really likes her music,

10:50.642 --> 10:53.176
and I know when she's harboring
feelings for her friend,

10:53.244 --> 10:55.645
but she doesn't know if he feels
the same way about her.

10:55.714 --> 10:57.380
But she told me she wanted
to try this whole Derek thing.

10:57.482 --> 10:58.881
She said she wants a better life.

10:58.983 --> 11:01.084
I think you're her better life.

11:02.087 --> 11:03.419
Now, you have a window.

11:03.488 --> 11:05.254
I-I don't know how big it is.

11:05.323 --> 11:06.956
She could get in that car
and not come back,

11:07.058 --> 11:08.991
but if you tell her
how you feel right now,

11:09.094 --> 11:10.326
you have a chance.

11:10.428 --> 11:11.794
Okay.

11:11.896 --> 11:13.363
I'm gonna do it.

11:13.431 --> 11:14.430
Wow!

11:14.499 --> 11:16.032
Ohh, the stakes could not be higher.

11:16.101 --> 11:18.267
But it's clear I just need
to take a deep breath,

11:18.336 --> 11:20.370
man up, and work on Angie's slideshow.

11:20.438 --> 11:21.537
You did not just say that.

11:21.606 --> 11:23.339
In the right hands,
a slideshow can be art.

11:23.441 --> 11:25.308
She is packing the car!
We don't have time for this!

11:25.377 --> 11:27.744
Poppy, this is the most
important thing I've ever done.

11:27.812 --> 11:30.313
I'm not gonna not do it
with a slideshow.

11:30.382 --> 11:31.647
Besides, I already made it.

11:31.716 --> 11:34.183
I just need to add one slide.
I got this.

11:34.285 --> 11:35.385
I know the perfect song.

11:36.354 --> 11:39.889
- ♪ I'm 15 for a moment... ♪
- Will.

11:41.025 --> 11:42.892
Do not use that song.

11:42.994 --> 11:44.460
Honestly...

11:44.485 --> 11:45.461
I might.

11:45.486 --> 11:46.676
Will.

11:46.746 --> 11:47.830
No.

11:48.713 --> 11:49.912
I might.

11:51.436 --> 11:52.235
All right.

11:52.303 --> 11:53.469
So you've had one-on-one time

11:53.571 --> 11:55.471
with each and every one of the guys.

11:55.573 --> 11:56.506
Who's it gonna be?

11:56.608 --> 11:57.774
Jared...

11:57.876 --> 11:59.142
Jared R...

11:59.244 --> 12:00.810
Jared T...

12:00.912 --> 12:01.911
or Dave?

12:04.215 --> 12:06.382
I don't know. They're all so amazing.

12:06.484 --> 12:07.850
Maybe if I visited their hometowns?

12:07.952 --> 12:09.886
- Hmm.
- Hey, can I steal Miggy for a sec?

12:09.988 --> 12:11.053
Oh, yeah.

12:11.122 --> 12:12.855
I just want to let you know
my heart is open.

12:12.924 --> 12:14.991
And I just want to say that I'm genuine.

12:15.093 --> 12:17.026
Jared R. is not here
for the right reasons.

12:17.128 --> 12:18.327
Don't do that. Come on, man.

12:18.430 --> 12:20.430
Miggy, you have to make a decision.

12:20.532 --> 12:22.732
It's time... to face the guys.

12:26.604 --> 12:29.272
It was a pleasure
getting to know you all.

12:29.374 --> 12:30.473
I-I honestly believe

12:30.542 --> 12:33.075
that Angie's subletter
is standing in this room.

12:34.512 --> 12:35.211
So...

12:36.815 --> 12:39.749
...the person I pick is...

12:48.193 --> 12:49.125
...is...

12:51.062 --> 12:53.029
I'm sorry. I can't.

12:53.131 --> 12:55.398
Gentlemen, a quick break?

12:56.552 --> 12:57.700
What is wrong with you?

12:57.802 --> 12:59.368
I can't let three hearts get broken!

12:59.437 --> 13:01.070
I just want everyone to be happy...

13:01.139 --> 13:03.406
Poppy, Douglas, Angie, Will, Derek,

13:03.508 --> 13:05.741
all the Jareds, and the Dave!

13:06.678 --> 13:08.778
What if there's a way
that we can get out of this

13:08.847 --> 13:10.613
without breaking any hearts?

13:10.682 --> 13:12.815
Sorry, I just wanted to say that...

13:12.884 --> 13:15.151
I think I'm falling in love
with this house.

13:15.220 --> 13:17.153
Calm down, Dave. It's a sublet.

13:17.255 --> 13:21.424
<i>- ♪ I'm 15 for a moment ♪</i>
- Just feel the beat. Don't think.

13:21.526 --> 13:24.560
- <i>♪ Caught in between 10 and 20 ♪</i>
- Just... slide.

13:24.662 --> 13:26.162
<i>♪ And I'm just dreaming ♪</i>

13:26.245 --> 13:28.340
Man, you are into whatever
you're working on.

13:28.410 --> 13:30.633
We never got to finish our chat.

13:30.735 --> 13:32.201
What is that? Is that PowerPoint?

13:32.270 --> 13:33.936
Oh, it... it... uh, nothing.

13:34.038 --> 13:35.905
Uh, I would love to chat,

13:35.974 --> 13:37.740
but let's get away from all this tech

13:37.809 --> 13:39.375
and go someplace where we can have

13:39.444 --> 13:41.744
a real man-to-man conversation.

13:44.115 --> 13:45.715
You know my grandfather
invented the dryer?

13:45.783 --> 13:48.417
That's a lie.
I don't know why I said that.

13:48.520 --> 13:50.520
Anyway, about Angie...

13:50.622 --> 13:52.688
- Angie?
- D'Amato, Will.

13:52.757 --> 13:54.624
I... think you know we're talking
about Angie D'Amato.

13:54.726 --> 13:55.758
Right. Well, what about her?

13:55.827 --> 13:59.495
Listen, I may not be school-smart, okay,

13:59.564 --> 14:01.430
but I'm intuitive.

14:01.499 --> 14:03.666
I always know when the drummer
from my band is gonna die.

14:03.735 --> 14:05.167
I'm 2-2 on that.

14:05.236 --> 14:07.136
So I'm good at sensing things.

14:07.205 --> 14:09.071
And I'm sensing something with Angie.

14:09.173 --> 14:10.373
Angie...?

14:10.475 --> 14:13.109
- Again, D'Amato.
- Mm.

14:13.177 --> 14:15.811
There's obviously something
going on between you.

14:17.048 --> 14:19.081
So, I wouldn't be able
to live with myself

14:19.150 --> 14:21.584
if I didn't look you in the eye

14:21.653 --> 14:23.786
and, once and for all...

14:23.855 --> 14:25.288
say...

14:25.390 --> 14:26.489
thank you.

14:26.591 --> 14:27.757
Huh?

14:27.825 --> 14:30.159
Whatever you're feeling,
you're not acting on it

14:30.228 --> 14:32.128
because you know that if this worked,

14:32.230 --> 14:34.997
she would have a family and...
and Graham would have a dad.

14:35.099 --> 14:37.900
And you not interfering with that,

14:38.002 --> 14:39.502
that's...

14:39.604 --> 14:40.636
that's cool.

14:40.738 --> 14:41.837
You're cool.

14:41.940 --> 14:44.074
Um...

14:44.160 --> 14:45.341
thanks.

14:45.443 --> 14:47.143
I don't know where you are on hugs...

14:47.245 --> 14:49.545
- Um...
- ...but for the record, I'm pro.

14:49.647 --> 14:50.913

15:12.397 --> 15:13.882
Please give me my laptop.

15:13.921 --> 15:16.207
There's... top-secret
weather stuff on there.

15:16.278 --> 15:18.378
This is, like...

15:18.447 --> 15:21.715
from every moment
I've had with you since we met.

15:21.783 --> 15:23.349
That time we went storm-chasing,

15:23.418 --> 15:25.977
when we were stoned on melatonin
with the butterflies,

15:26.054 --> 15:28.288
when we... kidnapped that goose.

15:42.227 --> 15:43.426

15:43.495 --> 15:44.527

15:44.596 --> 15:46.963

15:49.820 --> 15:52.320
_

16:00.745 --> 16:02.612
Well...

16:02.714 --> 16:04.380
what do you want to say?

16:09.053 --> 16:11.154
I want to say...

16:15.260 --> 16:17.326
Uh...

16:17.395 --> 16:19.328
I want to say...

16:19.397 --> 16:21.731
have a good summer in Barstow.

16:24.302 --> 16:25.902
That's everything?

16:27.739 --> 16:29.672
Pretty much, yeah.

16:33.678 --> 16:34.677
Okay.

16:35.613 --> 16:36.612
I will.

16:38.416 --> 16:39.982
Ready to go, Angie?

16:40.084 --> 16:41.651
Car's pretty much packed.

16:41.753 --> 16:42.585
Yeah.

16:43.688 --> 16:45.087
We should hit the road.

16:45.156 --> 16:47.523
Yeah. My turtle's
probably getting restless.

16:47.592 --> 16:49.158
I don't want her peeing in the new car.

17:05.777 --> 17:07.609
You give that desert hell, girl.

17:07.679 --> 17:09.645
Don't find another best friend
while I'm gone, okay?

17:09.747 --> 17:11.047
No way!

17:11.148 --> 17:12.781
You're my country.

17:12.884 --> 17:13.683
Heh?

17:15.520 --> 17:17.319
Well, Miggy did it again.

17:17.387 --> 17:19.888
What he means is,
we found you a new subletter.

17:19.958 --> 17:22.191
All four!
They'll all be paying you rent.

17:22.292 --> 17:24.160
40K a month, baby!

17:24.262 --> 17:25.994
Oh, sweet angel.

17:26.097 --> 17:27.163
Not even close.

17:27.265 --> 17:28.564
But it'll be a good chunk of money,

17:28.666 --> 17:29.699
minus my fee.

17:29.767 --> 17:30.800
That's amazing.

17:30.869 --> 17:32.735
Aw!

17:35.306 --> 17:36.672
For the road.

17:38.943 --> 17:40.910
No heart attacks till I get back, okay?

17:46.017 --> 17:47.783
So...

17:47.852 --> 17:50.052
have a good summer in Barstow.

17:50.154 --> 17:51.487
You said that already.

17:51.589 --> 17:52.288
Right.

17:52.390 --> 17:54.357
But I meant it.

17:56.094 --> 17:57.159
Bye, Will.

17:59.397 --> 18:01.898
Hey, um...

18:02.000 --> 18:04.333
in case we don't call or text
as much as we usually do,

18:04.435 --> 18:05.568
just...

18:06.905 --> 18:08.738
...don't finish "Gavel Town" without me.

18:09.941 --> 18:11.641
And...

18:13.578 --> 18:14.944
...remember to miss me.

18:16.881 --> 18:18.447
I'll do my best.

18:20.451 --> 18:21.517
Mm.

18:27.425 --> 18:29.058
Gosh. It's a shame.

18:29.160 --> 18:31.117
I got excited those two were
gonna make it work.

18:32.087 --> 18:34.397
Well, I haven't given up hope yet.

18:36.000 --> 18:37.466
Oh! Girls.

18:37.568 --> 18:39.302
I forgot to say goodbye.

18:39.404 --> 18:41.604
Let's not make this a production.

18:44.442 --> 18:47.043
Hey! Derek! You're 20 short!

18:47.145 --> 18:48.711
We take Venmo, dude!

19:00.897 --> 19:02.561
This is so sad!

19:02.647 --> 19:04.412
Let's focus on the positive, like...

19:05.912 --> 19:07.253
I got something.

19:07.327 --> 19:09.731
This guy made me
an incredible slideshow.

19:09.794 --> 19:11.127
You watched it?

19:11.229 --> 19:13.129
Twice! I got misty.

19:13.231 --> 19:16.255
It's almost as if
the slideshow took place...

19:16.325 --> 19:18.200
- Between the slides!
- ...between the slides.

19:18.247 --> 19:19.569
- Yes!
- Yes!

19:19.671 --> 19:21.686
