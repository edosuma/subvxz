00:06.000 --> 00:07.541
[narrator] Previously on Hit & Run:

00:07.625 --> 00:09.583
[Segev] Found a stack of passports
in her apartment.

00:09.666 --> 00:11.208
She had to be working for the government.

00:11.291 --> 00:12.541
-So CIA?
-[Tali] He's an American.

00:12.625 --> 00:16.041
Says he's a cultural affairs attaché,
but feels like government-related.

00:16.125 --> 00:20.000
-Assaf, cut the shit. We saw you with her.
-What do you--? No, no.

00:20.083 --> 00:21.083
[Segev] Did they call?

00:21.166 --> 00:24.750
[Ron] No, the police. Some investigator
was there. I punched him in the face.

00:24.833 --> 00:26.041
[Segev] You're a fool.

00:26.125 --> 00:27.458
I need to find Wexler.

00:27.541 --> 00:28.458
-Who are you calling?
-CIA.

00:28.541 --> 00:30.666
Maybe that'll draw Wexler
from the high grass.

00:30.750 --> 00:32.583
-Elush. What?
-Grandpa's here.

00:32.666 --> 00:35.333
[Segev] Tali, Wexler is in Israel.
I'm getting on the next flight.

00:35.416 --> 00:36.833
[man over PA] The doors are closing.

00:42.666 --> 00:45.041
[theme music playing]

01:10.875 --> 01:12.875
[suspenseful music playing]

01:25.041 --> 01:28.875
[woman over PA] Now arriving at
short-term parking and rental car garage.

01:42.416 --> 01:44.541
Excuse me. That train goes where?

01:44.625 --> 01:46.833
[woman] Back to JFK, where we just left.

02:06.166 --> 02:07.583
[woman over PA] This train is headed

02:07.666 --> 02:10.875
for the JFK International Airport,
Terminal 1.

02:38.833 --> 02:40.083
[Segev] Motherfucker.

03:11.916 --> 03:13.625
[man] Hey, that's my car! Hey!

04:16.541 --> 04:18.500
You have room for everything
at the new place?

04:19.458 --> 04:20.458
Don't need much.

04:21.375 --> 04:22.708
You know that's bull.

04:26.708 --> 04:28.000
Give me your keys, Assaf.

04:30.416 --> 04:31.250
You serious?

04:47.500 --> 04:49.291
Remember when we bought this place?

04:58.791 --> 05:00.791
[dramatic music playing]

05:10.625 --> 05:11.708
[sighs]

05:24.083 --> 05:26.375
-What? What information?
-[Danielle] Assaf.

05:27.083 --> 05:30.083
No, she can't hear me.
It's just some girl. You can talk.

05:31.583 --> 05:33.791
But why's it so bad? What is it?

05:35.916 --> 05:37.125
How did they get it?

05:39.416 --> 05:40.416
Fuck.

05:41.208 --> 05:43.333
Well, if they find out, that would be bad.

05:44.375 --> 05:47.458
Yeah, well, tell Eitan
I'll be there in 20 minutes.

05:47.541 --> 05:48.541
As fast as I can.

05:51.791 --> 05:53.250
Everything okay?

05:53.333 --> 05:55.125
Yeah, it's just work.

05:56.250 --> 05:57.208
You're leaving?

05:57.875 --> 06:00.916
Uh, yeah. I'll-- I'll call you later.

06:02.583 --> 06:05.416
Uh, glad I rushed over and made Syd leave.

06:15.833 --> 06:18.166
-I'll be back soon.
-Okay.

06:22.500 --> 06:24.791
[door opens, then closes]

06:31.458 --> 06:33.458
[cell phone ringing]

06:41.833 --> 06:43.583
Hello? [clears throat]

06:43.666 --> 06:45.666
[ringing continues]

06:49.791 --> 06:50.625
Hello?

06:51.250 --> 06:53.291
It's Segev. What's up? Where's Ella?

06:53.375 --> 06:55.250
I'm here. I'm at the house.

06:56.875 --> 06:59.583
Ella's fine. She's fine.
What about you? You landed?

06:59.666 --> 07:01.958
No, I'm in New York. Wexler set me up.

07:02.041 --> 07:04.833
-He tried to lure me to the airport.
-Okay.

07:04.916 --> 07:08.166
I'm at the house with Ella and Shira.
Everything's fine now.

07:08.833 --> 07:12.666
-Are you okay, Segev?
-Fuck. I'll call you later, Tali. Bye.

07:12.750 --> 07:14.833
[suspenseful music playing]

07:26.583 --> 07:28.666
Anyone come asking for me, Georgie?

07:30.875 --> 07:32.708
Uh, just Lido.

07:32.791 --> 07:33.916
What did Lido want?

07:34.000 --> 07:35.708
What does Lido always want?

07:36.541 --> 07:37.458
Anyone else?

07:37.541 --> 07:40.083
Anyone poking around
my apartment building?

07:40.166 --> 07:42.791
No. What am I, your fucking doorman now?

07:42.875 --> 07:45.875
Hey, man, I need to know.
It's important to me.

07:46.708 --> 07:48.208
No, just Lido.

07:48.833 --> 07:50.833
You got wax in your ears.

07:54.083 --> 07:56.708
-Hey, aren't you the oregano guy?
-Fuck off.

07:56.791 --> 07:58.041
Whoa, chill out, man.

09:03.500 --> 09:06.125
-He never got off the train?
-[man] Hold on, sir.

09:06.208 --> 09:09.041
This just came through the wires.
Sending to you now.

09:16.333 --> 09:18.333
Yes, that's Segev Azulai.

09:18.416 --> 09:21.541
Surveillance footage shows him
boarding the return train to JFK.

09:21.625 --> 09:22.458
Fuck.

09:22.958 --> 09:26.083
We went through the TSA lists,
he never went through security.

09:26.166 --> 09:27.791
He's still in the U.S.

09:28.416 --> 09:29.750
-Find him.
-Yes, sir.

09:40.833 --> 09:43.208
-Assaf, what the hell?
-Who did you tell?

09:43.291 --> 09:45.791
-Uh, you can't just barge into--
-Who did you tell?

09:45.875 --> 09:48.125
-Who'd I tell about what?
-About me and Dani here?

09:48.208 --> 09:49.625
No one. Dani trusted me.

09:49.708 --> 09:52.500
-Assaf, you are scaring me.
-You introduced us years ago. Why?

09:52.583 --> 09:53.875
What are you talking about?

09:54.583 --> 09:58.250
You were at Hashoftim,
you asked who she was, I introduced you.

09:58.333 --> 10:01.458
-No one told you to set us up?
-What's wrong with you?

10:02.500 --> 10:03.791
Are you drunk?

10:05.125 --> 10:07.375
Who else was here other than me and Dani?

10:07.458 --> 10:10.958
It's my apartment, asshole.
I have a life too.

10:11.041 --> 10:14.083
No one gives a fuck
about you guys and your affair.

10:15.166 --> 10:16.708
You don't know shit!

10:16.791 --> 10:18.583
[dramatic music playing]

10:18.666 --> 10:20.208
Get out of my apartment!

10:23.291 --> 10:24.666
Assaf, stop!

10:24.750 --> 10:25.875
Stop.

10:26.375 --> 10:29.916
What the fuck are you doing?
Why are you acting so crazy?

10:30.375 --> 10:35.083
Whatever happened between you and Dani,
it's got nothing to do with me. Fuck you!

10:35.166 --> 10:36.916
Fuck you, this is my house!

10:37.000 --> 10:40.208
Oh, my God.
Okay, right, you are really scaring me.

10:40.291 --> 10:41.875
Honey, what is going on?

10:42.916 --> 10:46.333
Assaf, honey, you are so, so drunk.
You need to go home.

10:46.416 --> 10:49.208
They found out.
You were the only one that knew.

10:50.416 --> 10:52.000
You're crazy.

10:52.083 --> 10:54.083
Right, I'm calling the police.

10:55.625 --> 10:56.458
Fuck!

10:57.083 --> 10:58.083
Are you fuck--?

11:05.375 --> 11:06.208
Fuck.

11:07.125 --> 11:08.250
Fuck.

11:08.333 --> 11:09.250
What is it?

11:09.958 --> 11:11.125
A fucking camera.

11:11.875 --> 11:12.708
What?

11:14.916 --> 11:16.791
Wait, how did that get there?

11:23.458 --> 11:25.375
What--? What's going on?

11:41.708 --> 11:43.708
[suspenseful music playing]

11:54.750 --> 11:57.500
Hey, Shapira.
Someone sent this over last night.

11:57.583 --> 11:58.583
Has your name.

12:17.500 --> 12:19.500
[dramatic music playing]

12:37.583 --> 12:38.958
[line beeping]

12:47.166 --> 12:49.833
Hey, boychik. Boychik!

12:51.208 --> 12:52.208
What's up?

12:52.291 --> 12:53.833
Dad, where'd you go the other day?

12:53.916 --> 12:55.666
-That's your dad?
-Yeah.

12:55.750 --> 12:57.083
What is he, homeless?

12:57.166 --> 13:00.583
Hey, I'll show you what homeless is.
What you got there?

13:01.500 --> 13:05.000
-You should wait for the light, Dad.
-I should, shouldn't I?

13:05.083 --> 13:08.875
-Let's walk together to school.
-I'm supposed to ride the bus.

13:08.958 --> 13:11.125
Okay. I'll ride along, that's fine.

13:16.125 --> 13:19.416
-[man] Hey, you can't get on the bus.
-[Ron] I'll get right off. I'm his dad.

13:27.583 --> 13:30.000
So how do kids supposed
to get lunch to school?

13:30.083 --> 13:31.375
No eating.

13:31.458 --> 13:33.166
So the sign should say "no eating."

13:39.125 --> 13:42.333
-I have to tell you something, boychik.
-What?

13:44.166 --> 13:46.000
I gotta go back home to Israel.

13:47.000 --> 13:47.833
Why?

13:48.583 --> 13:53.208
Well, because the sun always shines there,
and women, they shoot straight, huh?

13:55.083 --> 13:56.416
Israel's far.

13:56.875 --> 13:58.291
Not as far as you think.

14:00.625 --> 14:03.208
Dad, how will I get to see you?

14:04.583 --> 14:07.416
We won't be seeing each other
for a little while.

14:08.000 --> 14:11.541
But what about the guitar lessons?
Did I do something bad?

14:11.625 --> 14:12.666
What? No.

14:12.750 --> 14:14.333
No, Miles, no. It's...

14:17.750 --> 14:19.208
just for a little while.

14:21.500 --> 14:23.500
[dramatic music playing]

14:30.291 --> 14:31.958
I'll leave you to your friends, huh?

14:42.791 --> 14:43.958
Love you, Milush!

14:54.625 --> 14:55.666
Love you, Milush.

15:04.916 --> 15:05.958
[Henry] Um...

15:06.833 --> 15:08.833
When did you learn how to cook?

15:08.916 --> 15:10.000
[Naomi] Ha-ha.

15:10.833 --> 15:12.583
Too bad there's no bacon.

15:13.333 --> 15:14.333
[clears throat]

15:14.958 --> 15:17.708
[Henry] I smelled it. I thought
it must have been the neighbors.

15:19.041 --> 15:19.875
Nay...

15:21.166 --> 15:24.541
I appreciate this delicious apology,
but we need to talk.

15:28.416 --> 15:30.125
This is a big story, Henry.

15:30.708 --> 15:33.416
Might be my most important piece ever.

15:33.500 --> 15:37.083
What is the fucking story?
What's with all the secrecy?

15:37.166 --> 15:38.208
Turns out...

15:39.250 --> 15:43.208
Segev's wife was a CIA officer
who was murdered in Tel Aviv.

15:43.291 --> 15:44.375
Holy shit.

15:45.833 --> 15:49.666
What was she doing married to him?
Wasn't he just some tour guide?

15:49.750 --> 15:50.750
Yes.

15:52.000 --> 15:56.416
There's so much we don't know yet,
but that's why I'm so excited about it.

15:56.500 --> 15:57.333
Naomi...

15:58.000 --> 16:02.541
a journalist's job is to observe stories,
not be part of them.

16:03.500 --> 16:06.583
I'm not part of this story, Henry.

16:06.666 --> 16:08.916
You think I don't know what my job is?

16:10.458 --> 16:11.291
Well...

16:12.083 --> 16:14.833
how does this Ron guy figure
into the story?

16:14.916 --> 16:18.750
The guy tried to light up a spliff
in the living room before you got here.

16:18.833 --> 16:21.250
Ron? Ron is his own thing.

16:22.041 --> 16:23.125
He, um...

16:23.208 --> 16:26.458
He has PTSD.
He and Segev were in the IDF together.

16:26.541 --> 16:28.833
If this involves the CIA,
you gotta be careful.

16:28.916 --> 16:31.791
They won't be happy about you
poking around in affairs of state.

16:31.875 --> 16:32.708
I know.

16:33.791 --> 16:35.500
That's what I'm counting on.

16:38.875 --> 16:40.875
[ominous music playing]

16:47.250 --> 16:48.541
[engine starts]

17:33.250 --> 17:34.250
[car alarm chirps]

17:43.291 --> 17:45.041
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

17:45.125 --> 17:46.333
Namaste.

17:49.333 --> 17:50.166
Thank you.

17:51.000 --> 17:52.916
-Namaste.
-Yes.

17:53.541 --> 17:56.375
-Have you done hot yoga before?
-Many times.

17:56.458 --> 17:59.208
-[woman] We have some--
-I see that my friend is here.

18:00.291 --> 18:01.500
Oh, you know Xael?

18:02.208 --> 18:04.166
Xael? Of course. Just a second.

18:04.250 --> 18:06.375
Xael! Xael Wakefield.

18:06.458 --> 18:07.416
Yes?

18:08.750 --> 18:10.500
You don't remember me?

18:11.125 --> 18:13.625
I worked with your husband at the agency.

18:13.708 --> 18:15.375
-Really?
-Yeah.

18:15.458 --> 18:16.875
-Where?
-Pakistan.

18:16.958 --> 18:18.416
Before he went to Tel Aviv.

18:18.500 --> 18:20.375
We were together in Islamabad.

18:20.458 --> 18:23.416
-What's your name?
-Segev. Segev Azulai.

18:23.500 --> 18:25.958
-I will tell Reese we saw each other.
-You know what?

18:26.916 --> 18:29.125
I was so fat then, since I saw Reese.

18:29.208 --> 18:30.958
I lost like 100 pounds.

18:31.500 --> 18:33.000
Hot yoga, it works.

18:33.083 --> 18:34.666
Really? That's great.

18:34.750 --> 18:36.708
-You have your phone here?
-I do.

18:36.791 --> 18:38.875
Let's take a selfie, send it to Reese.

18:38.958 --> 18:41.750
He'll think we're running away together
now that I became so handsome.

18:42.583 --> 18:43.416
Okay.

18:50.375 --> 18:51.375
[camera clicks]

18:52.500 --> 18:54.458
-Cute.
-Send it. Send it now.

18:54.541 --> 18:55.916
Let's see what he says.

18:57.375 --> 18:58.541
Yeah.

18:58.625 --> 19:01.375
-See you inside. I'll save a spot.
-Yeah. Sure.

19:04.000 --> 19:04.958
Namaste.

19:05.625 --> 19:06.708
Nama-fuck-you.

19:08.083 --> 19:09.083
[cell phone beeps]

19:09.166 --> 19:11.166
[ominous music playing]

19:26.416 --> 19:27.791
-Good morning, David.
-Uh...

19:29.333 --> 19:30.333
Coffee?

19:30.416 --> 19:31.541
Already had mine.

19:33.000 --> 19:34.916
So, uh, how--? How's your family?

19:35.875 --> 19:38.000
All good, thanks. You came here for that?

19:38.541 --> 19:41.208
No, it's, uh... It's a mess.

19:41.291 --> 19:42.458
Yes, so I've heard.

19:43.708 --> 19:47.208
-Well, what did you hear?
-I don't care to be involved in it.

19:47.291 --> 19:50.041
And even if I was,
you know I couldn't tell you.

19:50.125 --> 19:51.458
Yeah, yeah. I just, uh...

19:53.625 --> 19:54.958
I need them to understand.

19:55.791 --> 19:58.708
I know now this whole thing
is connected to Eitan and--

19:59.166 --> 20:01.583
To Eitan and that girl Dani. That girl...

20:02.625 --> 20:05.416
The girl that I was seeing. That girl...

20:06.250 --> 20:08.083
-and what she got out of him.
-Mm-hm.

20:08.541 --> 20:10.375
I had no part in it. It was beyond me.

20:10.458 --> 20:14.125
It's important they know that. I know
I can help them, I just need access to--

20:14.208 --> 20:16.083
Assaf, please stop. Please.

20:17.833 --> 20:19.541
What? Come on, David, talk to me.

20:21.000 --> 20:22.708
I shouldn't even be seen with you.

20:24.875 --> 20:26.875
Just listen, you're the fall guy.

20:28.083 --> 20:29.750
And they accuse you of espionage.

20:29.833 --> 20:31.833
[dramatic music playing]

20:33.166 --> 20:34.583
You know that's something
I would never do.

20:34.666 --> 20:37.125
Assaf, we've been friends for many years.

20:38.500 --> 20:43.208
You want my advice? Forget about the job,
get yourself a good lawyer.

21:05.666 --> 21:07.875
-Get back to me in an hour.
-All right.

21:19.291 --> 21:20.125
Hey.

21:21.208 --> 21:23.208
-I studied judo, you know.
-Try me.

21:23.291 --> 21:25.583
I will, next time. Not kidding.

21:26.250 --> 21:27.208
What's going on?

21:29.000 --> 21:31.208
Wexler called Ella,
told her he's in Israel.

21:31.291 --> 21:33.208
Tried to lure me to the airport.

21:33.708 --> 21:35.750
-Shit, what does this guy want?
-I don't know.

21:36.791 --> 21:38.708
-Did he contact you?
-No.

21:39.250 --> 21:41.375
The CIA and the police are after me.

21:42.750 --> 21:44.958
When Wexler calls,
tell him I want to meet him.

21:45.041 --> 21:48.041
I'm not your fucking secretary.
Take your own calls.

21:48.541 --> 21:51.291
His real name is Reese Wakefield.

21:52.458 --> 21:55.583
-Is that classified information?
-Yeah. And they can use it.

21:56.291 --> 21:59.833
-Where do you want the meeting?
-39th Street. The Thai place.

21:59.916 --> 22:02.000
-Thai Rama? It's only takeout.
-Yeah.

22:02.083 --> 22:03.791
-Behind the restaurant.
-In the alley?

22:03.875 --> 22:04.708
Yeah.

22:04.791 --> 22:08.000
Segev, people don't do meetings
in alleyways.

22:08.625 --> 22:11.375
-Did you have something else in mind?
-No, no, no.

22:11.458 --> 22:15.958
I just wanna control the meeting
in a place he can't ambush me, that's it.

22:16.041 --> 22:17.750
That's it. Trust me.

22:18.875 --> 22:20.625
Okay? Trust me.

22:20.708 --> 22:23.000
[line ringing]

22:25.916 --> 22:28.208
-[Xael] Hi.
-Where the hell have you been?

22:28.791 --> 22:30.416
Yoga. You get the photo?

22:31.000 --> 22:33.666
I did. Where was he?
Where did he find you?

22:34.291 --> 22:37.541
He was at my yoga studio,
but he skipped the class. Why?

22:38.041 --> 22:39.500
What did he say to you?

22:39.583 --> 22:41.750
Islamabad. Tel Aviv. Felt legit.

22:43.208 --> 22:45.166
-Where are you now?
-Home.

22:45.250 --> 22:47.125
Reese, what's going on?

22:48.000 --> 22:50.666
Call security,
tell them not to let anyone in.

22:50.750 --> 22:53.125
No deliveries, no one. Okay?

23:15.458 --> 23:17.458
[suspenseful music playing]

23:25.541 --> 23:26.375
What?

23:27.208 --> 23:29.291
WD, man. That stuff works.

23:29.375 --> 23:31.708
-Super's usually got a can.
-Thanks.

23:32.291 --> 23:33.125
Thank you.

23:39.875 --> 23:42.375
-What the fuck you doing?
-Hey, hey, relax! Ron!

23:42.458 --> 23:43.625
Relax, man.

23:43.708 --> 23:45.458
Just relax, it's me. Give it to me.

23:46.041 --> 23:48.333
-Relax, man.
-Fuck me. For fuck's sake.

23:48.416 --> 23:49.500
What's your problem?

23:50.333 --> 23:51.583
[Ron] Why aren't you in Israel?

23:52.708 --> 23:53.916
Why I'm not in Israel?

23:55.125 --> 23:57.083
'Cause Wexler played me. He never left.

24:00.416 --> 24:01.583
At least Ella's okay.

24:03.166 --> 24:04.708
Wow. Wow.

24:06.291 --> 24:09.625
-What's your problem, man?
-Sorry, I had nowhere else to stay.

24:09.708 --> 24:13.000
-So I just picked the stupid lock.
-Drink, drink. Drink it.

24:13.375 --> 24:14.916
Sorry, man. Sorry, I...

24:16.083 --> 24:17.666
I have nowhere to stay. I...

24:19.250 --> 24:21.166
picked that stupid lock.

24:21.250 --> 24:23.791
You picked the lock?
You killed that thing.

24:27.083 --> 24:29.250
Yeah, just put some oil in it. It's not...

24:29.333 --> 24:31.208
That's what WD-40's for.

24:31.875 --> 24:34.500
Where would I get WD-40, huh?

24:34.583 --> 24:36.791
There's the kitchen,
there's olive oil there.

24:36.875 --> 24:40.541
Why the hell would you use olive oil?
That's what WD-40's for.

24:40.625 --> 24:42.708
Fine. I'll go get you some in Walmart.

24:43.750 --> 24:44.833
That's funny.

24:47.875 --> 24:51.750
Listen, man...
I can't stay for a long time.

24:52.791 --> 24:54.875
I gotta talk to Wexler and get this done.

24:57.708 --> 24:59.583
Wexler tried to kill you, man.

25:01.958 --> 25:02.791
Listen,

25:03.708 --> 25:04.666
grab a flight.

25:05.666 --> 25:08.875
Get to Israel.
I'll stay here. It's my issue.

25:11.000 --> 25:13.166
You think I would without you?

25:16.625 --> 25:17.666
You should.

25:17.750 --> 25:19.291
Before it's too late.

25:21.291 --> 25:23.125
I'm not going alone.

25:26.416 --> 25:27.541
You're a fool.

25:28.375 --> 25:29.375
You're a fool.

25:32.750 --> 25:34.166
[cell phone rings]

25:37.041 --> 25:37.875
Hicks.

25:38.458 --> 25:39.625
[Martin] It's Martin Wexler.

25:39.708 --> 25:41.625
[dramatic music playing]

25:42.416 --> 25:45.291
I assume you can connect me
to Segev Azulai?

25:45.375 --> 25:47.625
Yes. He wants a meeting.

25:47.708 --> 25:48.541
As do I.

25:48.625 --> 25:51.875
-Have him come down to our office on 6th.
-No, not good.

25:51.958 --> 25:53.958
This is Segev's meeting.
He chose a location.

25:54.041 --> 25:55.333
That won't work for us.

25:55.416 --> 25:58.083
His location or he won't be there.

26:03.125 --> 26:04.291
Wexler?

26:05.166 --> 26:07.250
Fine. Where?

26:10.375 --> 26:12.916
Tomorrow at 6 p.m.

26:14.666 --> 26:17.875
I'll call you tomorrow at 3:00
with the final location.

26:31.333 --> 26:32.833
Leave that alone, please.

26:33.833 --> 26:34.666
Sure.

26:36.000 --> 26:36.833
Sorry.

26:39.291 --> 26:41.458
-What do you wanna do?
-[Martin] I don't know yet.

26:42.375 --> 26:44.375
But we'll be prepared this time.

27:04.208 --> 27:06.500
That's a stupid move.

27:08.500 --> 27:09.875
You don't play anymore?

27:11.291 --> 27:12.500
Kids moved away.

27:12.583 --> 27:16.958
Chess set probably went for 25 cents
in one of many garage sales.

27:17.583 --> 27:20.625
I'll buy you one you won't sell. Classic.

27:21.291 --> 27:22.750
Good, heavy pieces.

27:22.833 --> 27:25.750
You can keep it in your office
and then I'll kick your ass.

27:26.541 --> 27:28.208
Are we meeting so you could say yes?

27:29.083 --> 27:31.916
-I have questions.
-Hopefully, I have answers.

27:33.583 --> 27:35.083
First question, why me?

27:37.666 --> 27:39.041
I've known you forever.

27:40.000 --> 27:44.041
You have this rare, odd mix
that's good for the job.

27:45.250 --> 27:47.833
You're empathetic and you're ruthless.

27:47.916 --> 27:50.000
If I'm in, I want to go overseas.

27:50.625 --> 27:54.041
Means giving up your life, your family.

27:55.666 --> 27:56.666
Everything.

27:57.791 --> 27:59.291
That is a cool chess set.

28:01.041 --> 28:03.041
[dramatic music playing]

28:12.291 --> 28:14.083
You can start playing again.

Hey.

29:05.375 --> 29:07.041
Yeah, I'm heading out now.

29:09.000 --> 29:12.666
No. Just tired and my back aches.

29:14.750 --> 29:17.041
Which one?
The one you make with the cinnamon?

29:19.458 --> 29:20.291
Yeah.

29:21.375 --> 29:22.416
Sounds good.

29:24.583 --> 29:25.458
Bye.

29:39.625 --> 29:40.916
See you tomorrow.

29:43.041 --> 29:44.416
Tali, get in here, please.

29:53.625 --> 29:54.458
Sit.

-Dror, if it's about--
-I could not care less.

30:03.958 --> 30:06.333
You accessed my computer
without my permission?

30:06.416 --> 30:08.041
Why did you do that?

30:08.125 --> 30:10.541
-Have you lost your mind?
-I promise you--

30:10.625 --> 30:13.416
If I could believe a word out
of your mouth, I would keep listening.

30:13.500 --> 30:16.750
This frustrates me beyond belief.
You lied and risked your job.

30:16.833 --> 30:18.166
You left me with no choice

30:19.375 --> 30:21.166
I have to suspend you now.

30:23.541 --> 30:24.833

Look, the restaurant is right
on 39th Street.

31:08.375 --> 31:10.125
You drop me off over there.

31:10.208 --> 31:12.041
This is where I go, meet Wexler.

31:12.125 --> 31:14.375
You drive there and back me up, got it?

Yes, yes. Just a second.

Meeting's at 6 p.m., Brooklyn Museum.

31:38.708 --> 31:41.750
What? No, no, no. I said 39th Street.
I wanna control the meeting.

31:41.833 --> 31:43.625
No. I won't listen to this insanity.

31:43.708 --> 31:46.458
You're asking me to entrap
and endanger a public servant.

31:46.541 --> 31:48.583
I'm a fucking U.S. citizen.
That's treason.

-But, listen, I wanna--
-I'm a journalist.

I said I would help you find
the truth, not revenge.

Okay, okay.

but there's metal detectors all over.

Maybe Segev really is just trouble.

-Tali, let it go. Relax.
-[Segev] Tali?

I'm busting my ass for you.
At least answer my calls.

32:35.375 --> 32:36.791
Okay, don't be mad.

32:36.875 --> 32:40.000
-I'm not mad. Segev, you're killing me!
-I'm right here, Tali.

32:40.083 --> 32:41.291
You're not here. You're there.

32:41.375 --> 32:42.833
You left off on some crazy manhunt

32:42.916 --> 32:45.250
and left me here
to take care of all your crap!

32:45.875 --> 32:47.500
I thought you got arrested.

32:48.625 --> 32:51.041
-I got a report today.
-What report?

32:52.083 --> 32:53.625
From the police in New York.

32:54.250 --> 32:56.083
-Segev?
-What's in the report?

32:56.166 --> 32:58.041
That they found the guys who murdered Dani

32:58.125 --> 33:01.333
dumped in some alley in Queens
after their brains were blown out.

33:05.458 --> 33:06.625
Don't lie to me.

What have you done?

33:09.458 --> 33:11.208
Tell me, did you see Ella?

33:11.291 --> 33:14.708
Segev, did you listen at all?

33:14.791 --> 33:17.750
Segev, I lost my job today!
I can't help-- [grunts]

33:18.625 --> 33:19.750
What's wrong, Tali?

33:20.750 --> 33:21.750
What's wrong?

33:21.833 --> 33:23.416
-Tali?
-Tali?

-What's wrong?
-[Omer] What's going on, Tali?

What's wrong?

-What is it, the baby?
-I can't breathe.

33:31.208 --> 33:33.291
-Tali? What's up?
-I can't breathe.

33:33.375 --> 33:36.208
You understand what are you doing?
Stop calling her!

33:36.291 --> 33:37.416
Who's that?

33:37.500 --> 33:39.625
We're gonna go to the hospital. Come on.

33:39.708 --> 33:42.000
-What's going on?
-[Omer] We have to go now.

Tali, come on.
Keep your phone on. I'll call you.

Let's go to the hospital now.

-Come on. I'll call you.
-Okay.

-They took her to the hospital.
-Okay, she'll be fine. We'll be late.

33:54.708 --> 33:57.666
-[Segev] I'm worried about her.
-There's nothing you can do.

You ready? No shooting.

Since when do we shoot? Come on.

He's on his way.

34:37.958 --> 34:39.208
He go by Wexler too?

34:41.458 --> 34:43.541
The story you're working on
with Segev Azulai?

34:44.708 --> 34:46.333
It concerns national security.

34:46.416 --> 34:49.208
-Are you telling me I can't publish it?
-If I have to.

34:49.291 --> 34:53.166
Is that Martin Wexler telling me
or Reese Wakefield?

34:53.250 --> 34:54.791
So you know my real name.

34:55.875 --> 34:58.791
-I'm not impressed.
-The story is gonna come out.

34:58.875 --> 35:03.000
And right now it looks like
the CIA killed one of its own officers.

35:03.083 --> 35:04.916
If you print that,
you'll be publishing fiction.

35:05.000 --> 35:07.250
Then tell me what is going on here.

What about the metal detectors?

35:34.208 --> 35:35.291
The museum?

35:35.375 --> 35:36.625
Just security.

35:37.583 --> 35:39.375
What if security calls the cops?

35:39.458 --> 35:41.625
They'll be stuck in traffic just like us.

35:41.708 --> 35:43.583
You've ever been to that museum?

35:46.208 --> 35:48.416
I look like a guy who goes to the museum?

35:48.500 --> 35:50.166
And you call yourself Jewish?

36:00.708 --> 36:02.375
We're late. Goddamn traffic.

36:03.166 --> 36:04.708
This ain't Tel Aviv, for sure.

36:05.583 --> 36:08.000
Don't worry, Wexler ain't going anywhere.

36:08.083 --> 36:09.791
You're his big prize, baby.

36:11.666 --> 36:13.666
[dramatic music playing]

36:14.916 --> 36:15.791
Shit!

36:25.166 --> 36:26.708
[shouting]

36:34.375 --> 36:35.416
[Segev] Come on.

36:36.958 --> 36:38.791
What happened? What's wrong?

36:46.583 --> 36:48.583
They got me. Fucking Wexler.

37:03.625 --> 37:04.458
Segev.

37:06.250 --> 37:07.375
Segev, they--

37:08.000 --> 37:08.916
Segev.

37:16.458 --> 37:19.000
Come on, bro.
I'll get you to the hospital.

37:19.083 --> 37:19.916
No hospital.

37:22.625 --> 37:23.791
There's no choice.

37:25.458 --> 37:27.750
-In Israel.
-Fine, in Israel.

37:28.583 --> 37:30.625
Israel, my ass. We're in New York, man.

37:33.333 --> 37:36.625
They call the cops if you take me there.
They'll send me back to prison.

37:37.083 --> 37:38.750
It doesn't matter. You need a doctor.

37:39.500 --> 37:41.750
-I'm not going back to prison.
-Press-- Okay.

37:43.000 --> 37:44.166
Press hard, don't stop.

37:50.708 --> 37:52.916
You wanted Israel?
I'll take you to Israel.

37:53.541 --> 37:54.791
Don't let go.

37:55.916 --> 37:58.458
Shema Israel... Shema Israel…

37:58.958 --> 38:00.583
Don't say that shit. Stop right now.

38:01.125 --> 38:03.250
I said, stop right now.
And hold that shit.

38:04.416 --> 38:07.208
Just hold that shit, man! Just hold it!

38:12.500 --> 38:13.791
Just lean back. Come on.

38:15.541 --> 38:17.083
I'll take you to Israel, man.

38:19.041 --> 38:19.875
Hang tight.

38:30.000 --> 38:31.625
I've been here long enough.

38:33.375 --> 38:35.083
You don't know shit about this story.

38:35.166 --> 38:37.625
But it's dangerous
to traffic in state secrets.

38:37.708 --> 38:39.458
I would have assumed you'd know that.

38:42.250 --> 38:44.166
[Naomi] Wait. I just have one question.

38:46.416 --> 38:48.333
Did the CIA kill Sophie Dreyer?

38:51.000 --> 38:52.208
Who's Sophie Dreyer?

39:23.625 --> 39:25.625
[somber music playing]

39:35.708 --> 39:38.208
[in Hebrew] May the great name of God
be exalted and sanctified...

39:40.375 --> 39:44.541
throughout the world,
which he has created...

39:45.958 --> 39:48.583
according to his will.

39:52.208 --> 39:53.750
He who makes peace in his heavens,

39:53.833 --> 39:56.000
may he bring peace upon us
and upon all Israel.

39:56.083 --> 39:57.083
[in English] Amen.

40:25.000 --> 40:27.458
[ominous music playing]

40:31.541 --> 40:32.916
Who the fuck are you, huh?

40:42.375 --> 40:43.833
[screaming]

40:49.708 --> 40:50.583
Who sent you?

40:51.958 --> 40:53.041
Talk.

40:57.625 --> 41:00.333
You kill my friend, you use my family...

41:01.666 --> 41:03.916
You use my daughter, you motherfucker?

41:04.000 --> 41:05.416
You use my daughter?

41:13.291 --> 41:15.416
Your wife was a fucking traitor.

41:17.958 --> 41:20.375
What did you say? What did you say?

41:20.458 --> 41:21.458
What'd you say?

41:24.291 --> 41:25.666
[cell phone ringing]

41:35.458 --> 41:37.458
[suspenseful music playing]

41:41.333 --> 41:42.750
Talk to me. Is it done?

41:43.583 --> 41:44.750
You piece of shit.

41:45.458 --> 41:47.250
You messed with the wrong guy.

42:00.125 --> 42:02.125
