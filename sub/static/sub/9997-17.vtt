00:03.010 --> 00:03.830
Hi honey, it's me,

00:03.830 --> 00:06.810
you know, I've done with my
phiscal and I'm back at work.

00:07.270 --> 00:08.370
Doctor said I look good.

00:09.920 --> 00:11.330
Although, I must be getting older.

00:11.400 --> 00:14.840
She said she wants me to start
doing an annual mammogram.

00:15.920 --> 00:18.000
Really? You never done one of those?

00:18.530 --> 00:19.260
It's cute.

00:20.830 --> 00:22.580
Getting old is a bitch.

00:24.000 --> 00:30.074

00:41.380 --> 00:42.180
There she is.

00:42.430 --> 00:43.980
I was wondering when you
were going to show up.

00:45.240 --> 00:46.030
I'm sorry.

00:46.110 --> 00:46.840
Do I know you?

00:47.030 --> 00:47.910
Of course you do.

00:48.100 --> 00:49.590
You've worked for me for years.

00:50.230 --> 00:52.180
It's me, Manuel.

00:52.870 --> 00:54.390
District Attorney Devalos.

00:55.870 --> 00:56.610
Duck!

00:57.240 --> 00:58.190
You're out of there!

00:59.340 --> 01:00.400
You like office dodge ball?

01:01.370 --> 01:02.510
'Cause I'm picking you for my team.

01:03.080 --> 01:04.090
I pick Allison!

01:05.420 --> 01:07.290
So, what do you think?

01:07.860 --> 01:08.570
Of what?

01:08.850 --> 01:09.750
Of this.

01:09.930 --> 01:11.560
It's the ultimate wish fulfillment.

01:11.910 --> 01:13.410
You're anxious about getting older,

01:13.510 --> 01:14.620
so you dream you're a child again.

01:15.040 --> 01:17.640
No mammogram for you,
no colonoscopy for me.

01:17.640 --> 01:19.400
Oh, and check out the hairline.

01:21.120 --> 01:22.110
So, wait.

01:23.210 --> 01:24.380
This is a dream?

01:25.700 --> 01:29.730
And I'm dreaming it just to feel better?

01:29.860 --> 01:31.540
Hey, that's what dreams are for.

01:31.710 --> 01:32.660
To make you feel good.

01:33.360 --> 01:35.680
You know what? You're right.

01:36.450 --> 01:37.550
I think I'd forgotten.

01:38.590 --> 01:39.520
Dreams should be fun.

01:39.580 --> 01:40.940
They should make you feel good.

01:51.050 --> 01:52.930
So this is how you use your gift?

01:56.050 --> 01:57.330
Are you talking to me?

01:58.680 --> 01:59.520
This
dream--

01:59.560 --> 02:01.640
it's so... frivolous.

02:02.210 --> 02:03.190
Frivolous?

02:04.300 --> 02:05.070
Well, I don't know.

02:05.750 --> 02:06.930
It does make me feel good.

02:06.980 --> 02:07.880
It is fun.

02:08.639 --> 02:10.229
I mean, that's what
dreams are for, right?

02:10.820 --> 02:11.770
To make you feel good?

02:12.180 --> 02:14.930
How can you be so
preoccupied with feeling good

02:15.840 --> 02:17.490
when life is so bad?

02:19.460 --> 02:20.360
Wait a second.

02:21.290 --> 02:22.130
Is it?

02:23.380 --> 02:25.060
Is life so bad?

02:25.970 --> 02:26.900
It is for me.

02:37.870 --> 02:39.500
Hey, you, you okay over there?

02:40.550 --> 02:42.190
Huh? Yeah. Yeah. No.

02:42.860 --> 02:46.090
I'm fine. I just... I had a bad dream.

02:47.210 --> 02:48.510
Well, don't worry, dear.

02:48.720 --> 02:50.330
I'm right here beside you.

02:52.360 --> 02:53.410
Not.

03:29.030 --> 03:33.370
Medium  617

03:56.690 --> 03:57.800
Hi, Joe.

03:58.160 --> 03:59.700
I remember you.

03:59.880 --> 04:01.880
I'm glad that somebody knows who I am.

04:02.190 --> 04:04.400
I am so tired, I got in
the car to drive home,

04:04.450 --> 04:05.450
and I actually had to stop

04:05.450 --> 04:07.510
and think for a minute where we lived.

04:09.040 --> 04:10.360
It's not even 5:30.

04:10.400 --> 04:11.310
What are you doing up?

04:11.540 --> 04:13.000
Paying bills.

04:14.390 --> 04:15.510
Had a bad dream.

04:15.920 --> 04:16.800
Couldn't sleep.

04:16.850 --> 04:18.070
Kind of lonely in there.

04:18.500 --> 04:19.910
Well, I'm home now.

04:23.010 --> 04:25.080
For four whole hours almost.

04:26.460 --> 04:28.950
I have to be back at the office by 9:00.

04:29.270 --> 04:31.250
What is with all these crazy hours?

04:31.910 --> 04:33.400
Isn't Keith a one-man band?

04:33.440 --> 04:35.960
Isn't he the guy who
doesn't need anybody's help?

04:36.010 --> 04:37.060
Yeah, that was yesterday.

04:37.110 --> 04:38.100
This is today.

04:38.760 --> 04:42.860
Today, I think that the genius
may have finally met his match.

04:44.710 --> 04:46.370
Burroughs-Strauss sold the government

04:46.440 --> 04:48.020
a new high-tech drone.

04:48.060 --> 04:50.960
But it doesn't work
without a new, lighter fuel.

04:51.110 --> 04:52.990
Unfortunately, this new, lighter fuel

04:53.050 --> 04:54.440
has yet to be invented.

04:55.030 --> 04:56.550
That was supposed to be Keith's job

04:56.620 --> 04:58.850
and so far, Keith has come up empty.

04:59.100 --> 05:01.360
So, now he needs his seven dwarfs.

05:01.940 --> 05:05.640
Well, I can't speak
for the other six guys,

05:05.690 --> 05:08.810
but he sure is learning
on sleepy here... a lot.

05:14.430 --> 05:15.220
Glad you're here.

05:15.280 --> 05:16.560
Maybe you can make sense of this.

05:16.650 --> 05:17.750
Well, I'll do my best.

05:17.940 --> 05:20.100
But tell me something,
there's a coroner's van

05:20.170 --> 05:21.790
full of people sitting
out in front of this house.

05:21.830 --> 05:23.730
How about we invite
them in to do their work?

05:24.690 --> 05:25.990
It's okay. Let them drink their coffee.

05:26.040 --> 05:27.760
I think you need to see this first.

05:34.550 --> 05:35.590
What a mess.

05:35.850 --> 05:36.640
Tell me about it.

05:37.840 --> 05:40.650
He, they, them-- busted
in through that window.

05:40.780 --> 05:43.300
Somehow managed to turn
off the burglar alarm.

05:43.620 --> 05:45.970
Then, uh, did whatever it is

05:46.020 --> 05:47.150
they were trying to do in here.

05:49.480 --> 05:51.210
I'm going to need you to
put on some fresh booties.

05:55.540 --> 05:56.960
I don't understand, Lee.
Where are you taking us?

05:57.020 --> 05:58.570
This all looks pristine.

05:58.620 --> 06:00.570
Are you sure they even came
this far into the house?

06:00.710 --> 06:01.490
Pretty sure, yeah.

06:07.920 --> 06:09.390
Help me out here, Lee.
What are we looking at?

06:09.780 --> 06:11.160
You're looking at the Prescotts.

06:11.680 --> 06:13.270
Martin, a research chemist.

06:13.640 --> 06:15.030
Irene,
stay-at-home mom.

06:15.590 --> 06:16.470
Jason and Emily,

06:16.500 --> 06:18.770
a couple of well-liked
honor roll students.

06:21.170 --> 06:22.100
I don't get it.

06:22.140 --> 06:23.560
Why are they just sitting there?

06:23.640 --> 06:24.650
Are they real?

06:24.970 --> 06:26.260
Real dead. Yeah.

06:27.070 --> 06:28.250
What the hell happened here, Lee?

06:28.850 --> 06:30.380
Well, I can only tell you what I know,

06:30.420 --> 06:31.460
and that's not much.

06:32.080 --> 06:34.010
There are injection marks
on all of their necks.

06:34.050 --> 06:36.100
We're thinking that
the killer or killers

06:36.130 --> 06:39.020
crept in while the family
slept and incapacitated them

06:39.060 --> 06:41.640
one by one with some kind
of fast-acting poison.

06:42.960 --> 06:44.070
Then he drained their blood.

06:44.530 --> 06:47.000
- Drained their blood?
- Then he dressed them

06:47.070 --> 06:48.500
or, uh, redressed them,

06:48.540 --> 06:49.600
and then he posed them here.

06:50.280 --> 06:51.070
Like this.

06:52.020 --> 06:53.310
I'm sorry, you're
telling me that there's

06:53.340 --> 06:55.550
four bodies' worth of blood
somewhere in this house?

06:55.680 --> 06:56.720
Actually, no. We couldn't find

06:56.720 --> 06:58.580
a single drop of blood
in the entire place.

06:59.960 --> 07:00.970
That doesn't make any sense.

07:01.110 --> 07:02.670
Yeah, it does if he
took the blood with him.

07:05.140 --> 07:06.970
Hey. Sorry I'm late.

07:07.880 --> 07:08.540
What's going on?

07:09.560 --> 07:11.860
Uh, well, nobody quite knows what to do.

07:12.250 --> 07:13.850
About what? He told us

07:13.890 --> 07:15.180
to meet him in his office at 9:00

07:15.820 --> 07:18.650
- and it's six minutes past 9:00. Come on. Let' 
- Slow down.

07:18.650 --> 07:21.530
You might want to take a peek
inside before you go charging in.

07:30.420 --> 07:32.180
All right, well, I guess
we've got to wake him up.

07:32.760 --> 07:33.660
Uh, no, thank you.

07:33.780 --> 07:34.760
I've seen The Hurt Locker.

07:34.800 --> 07:35.710
I know how this ends.

07:36.100 --> 07:37.350
Brian, you're being ridiculous.

07:37.400 --> 07:38.930
Come on. We're under a deadline.

07:39.180 --> 07:40.100
He's under a deadline.

07:40.150 --> 07:41.150
He'd want us to wake him up.

07:41.210 --> 07:42.660
We're talking about Keith here.

07:42.850 --> 07:44.030
This guy was eccentric

07:44.030 --> 07:45.530
before he couldn't turn water into wine.

07:45.850 --> 07:48.000
Now that he's under all this
pressure with this fuel project,

07:48.060 --> 07:49.090
he's downright certifiable.

07:49.090 --> 07:49.620
Come on.

07:49.630 --> 07:51.170
You want to go in there
and wake him up, go ahead.

07:51.310 --> 07:53.640
Me? I'm staying right here
outside the blast zone.

07:53.710 --> 07:54.220
Okay.

07:54.220 --> 07:55.710
Besides, you bring him back to life,

07:55.760 --> 07:57.790
he may want us all to
do some actual work.

07:57.850 --> 07:58.600
God forbid.

07:58.600 --> 08:00.600
Joe, that's not what I signed on for.

08:00.660 --> 08:02.310
That's not what any of us signed on for.

08:14.660 --> 08:17.480
Keith, it's 9:00.

08:20.030 --> 08:20.680
Keith?

08:22.530 --> 08:23.330
Hello?

08:25.150 --> 08:26.570
It's time to wake up!

08:47.810 --> 08:49.310
- Yes?
- Good morning.

08:49.430 --> 08:50.680
This is your wake-up call.

08:52.240 --> 08:53.350
Wake-up call? What are you...

08:53.590 --> 08:55.240
What are you talking
about? I'm not asleep.

08:56.020 --> 08:58.380
I-I'm in the middle
of a solution here...

09:06.260 --> 09:07.560
How long have you been sitting there?

09:08.150 --> 09:09.130
Just a couple of minutes.

09:10.110 --> 09:12.880
Uh, don't, uh, take offense,

09:12.950 --> 09:13.930
but you look like hell.

09:14.590 --> 09:16.660
Do you want to just go
home, shower up a little bit?

09:16.660 --> 09:18.040
Take a moment.

09:18.090 --> 09:20.270
I can keep things moving along here.

09:20.330 --> 09:22.400
There's, there's, there's no time.

09:23.270 --> 09:24.350
Plus, I'm fine.

09:24.420 --> 09:27.480
I just, I just need to
find a clear channel.

09:28.710 --> 09:29.370
Excuse me?

09:30.290 --> 09:31.410
A clear channel.

09:34.170 --> 09:38.320
Look, the brain is an
amazing piece of engineering.

09:38.740 --> 09:43.430
It's a freakin' phenomenal synthesis
of chemistry and electronics,

09:43.490 --> 09:45.480
and sometimes the chemistry
is a little bit off

09:45.520 --> 09:48.320
or the electronics
aren't firing correctly,

09:48.390 --> 09:50.590
and I think that that's
what's going on right now.

09:51.230 --> 09:52.020
Okay.

09:52.020 --> 09:52.830
'Cause I can,

09:52.830 --> 09:54.730
I can see the solution to this thing.

09:54.820 --> 09:56.910
It's-it's-it's basically
just constructing something,

09:56.910 --> 09:59.380
but with fewer molecules.

09:59.470 --> 10:00.560
And I know how to do that,

10:00.560 --> 10:02.380
but every time I try, it's...

10:02.850 --> 10:04.840
I just can't get a clear channel.

10:05.110 --> 10:06.490
It's-it's like I can't
get the picture right

10:06.490 --> 10:08.430
inside of my brain.

10:09.160 --> 10:10.780
Okay, well,

10:10.780 --> 10:13.580
there's a, uh, whole bunch of
people waiting outside your door

10:13.580 --> 10:15.210
who'd love to help you with that.

10:16.150 --> 10:18.210
You mean "the clods"?

10:18.430 --> 10:19.460
They're not clods.

10:19.580 --> 10:20.330
They want to help.

10:21.150 --> 10:23.390
They're operating on
little or no sleep, too.

10:23.910 --> 10:25.240
They know you're smarter than they are.

10:25.300 --> 10:27.110
We all know you're smarter than we are.

10:27.680 --> 10:29.620
We just want you to
tell us what you need.

10:30.010 --> 10:30.860
I need them

10:30.860 --> 10:33.610
to stop trying to do
as little as possible

10:33.610 --> 10:34.990
for as much reward as possible.

10:35.140 --> 10:37.150
I need everyone to open their minds

10:37.150 --> 10:40.060
to unexplored possibilities.

10:40.510 --> 10:42.130
Okay, well, why don't
we get them in here

10:42.170 --> 10:43.370
and get them going on that?

10:44.460 --> 10:45.250
Come on in.

10:51.480 --> 10:52.560
Okay...

10:55.660 --> 10:57.210
Good morning, clods.

10:58.450 --> 10:59.660
I'm still drowning.

10:59.730 --> 11:01.300
Anyone have a life preserver?

11:07.160 --> 11:08.230
What a shock.

11:09.820 --> 11:11.140
Well, it's not a life preserver,

11:11.190 --> 11:13.020
but I was working on
something last night

11:13.020 --> 11:15.120
and, um, I looked at
it again this morning,

11:15.120 --> 11:17.690
and I think it... I
think it's pretty good.

11:18.190 --> 11:20.930
I know the solvent issue
has been hanging us up.

11:21.440 --> 11:24.400
Um, I think the problem might
be there are too many hexanes.

11:24.460 --> 11:26.610
Your channel isn't
clear either, my friend.

11:26.700 --> 11:28.000
This will not work.

11:28.150 --> 11:29.050
You haven't even read it.

11:29.320 --> 11:30.270
I think it's pretty good.

11:30.460 --> 11:32.620
Well, your thinking is flawed. Okay?

11:32.620 --> 11:34.790
I've already tried it. It won't work.

11:35.090 --> 11:36.150
Moving on. Uh...

11:38.430 --> 11:40.270
How about you, guy?

11:40.570 --> 11:43.000
Uh, do you have anything new for me?

11:47.950 --> 11:50.880
Do you have anything old for me?

11:56.280 --> 11:57.420
Riddle me this:

11:57.910 --> 12:00.770
what exactly do you
do here at this company

12:00.770 --> 12:03.880
besides consume time and space?

12:05.980 --> 12:07.990
Uh, with all due respect,

12:07.990 --> 12:10.420
I put in 17 hours yesterday

12:10.490 --> 12:12.340
and just got back
from a four-hour break.

12:12.460 --> 12:15.810
Time... and space.

12:19.680 --> 12:20.330
Go home.

12:21.370 --> 12:22.190
Excuse me?

12:22.470 --> 12:23.260
Go home.

12:25.270 --> 12:26.580
It's people like you

12:26.580 --> 12:29.200
that make it hard for me
to get a clear channel.

12:29.630 --> 12:31.340
You're using up all the air.

12:32.590 --> 12:33.700
What, are you firing me?

12:34.240 --> 12:36.040
Well, I don't really have a choice.

12:36.080 --> 12:37.790
Killing you is against the law.

12:37.950 --> 12:39.370
Whoa, Keith. Hey!

12:39.570 --> 12:40.620
Go home!

12:41.390 --> 12:43.010
Get! Be gone!

12:43.340 --> 12:44.730
- Go!
- With pleasure.

12:47.650 --> 12:50.880
Now, I hope that you people were
paying, uh, close attention to

12:50.880 --> 12:53.420
what just happened there, okay?

12:53.540 --> 12:56.060
There will be no free rides anymore.

12:56.150 --> 12:57.990
You will help me.

12:58.540 --> 13:00.450
Now,
this guy--

13:00.450 --> 13:02.590
this guy gets to go home and be fired!

13:02.980 --> 13:04.860
For the rest of you,
go back to your offices

13:04.910 --> 13:07.170
and figure out a way to help me.

13:07.590 --> 13:09.850
Figure out a way to help me!

13:13.520 --> 13:14.970
So, Keith just fired him?

13:15.080 --> 13:16.960
It's like he snapped.

13:17.750 --> 13:19.790
Actually, you know, I think,

13:19.790 --> 13:22.110
I think maybe he
snapped before any of us

13:22.110 --> 13:23.480
even got into work this morning.

13:23.830 --> 13:26.140
He was talking about
keeping a "Clear channel."

13:26.840 --> 13:29.230
But then he chose Brian to go postal on.

13:30.280 --> 13:30.920
I mean,

13:30.920 --> 13:32.870
it's really kind of
scary how unhinged he got.

13:35.050 --> 13:36.400
What is Brian going to do now?

13:37.420 --> 13:40.460
Well, he's got 16 months
left on his contract.

13:40.850 --> 13:42.320
I think he's going to sit at home.

13:42.910 --> 13:43.730
Do nothing.

13:43.910 --> 13:45.050
Cash his checks.

13:46.610 --> 13:47.810
Well, of course, before
yesterday all he did

13:47.810 --> 13:49.530
was sit at work and do nothing

13:49.530 --> 13:50.840
and cash his checks.

13:52.050 --> 13:54.010
Well, at least now he's
got an easier commute.

13:56.310 --> 13:58.940
It's just nobody should
be humiliated like that

13:58.940 --> 14:01.080
in front of their colleagues.

14:01.660 --> 14:03.700
The irony was, the
whole day was a waste.

14:04.020 --> 14:05.010
Nobody did any work.

14:05.930 --> 14:09.950
Everybody's talking around on
eggshells with a pit in their stomach.

14:10.720 --> 14:11.960
Still, you know,

14:11.960 --> 14:13.490
as nuts as Keith got,

14:13.490 --> 14:14.880
I still feel kind of sorry for him.

14:14.930 --> 14:18.700
I don't think he's ever stared
down the mouth of failure before.

14:19.890 --> 14:21.750
Girls, your dessert's ready!

14:25.660 --> 14:26.930
- You want chocolate?
- Nah.

14:27.110 --> 14:28.680
- Where's Ariel?
- Ariel?

14:29.000 --> 14:30.400
You're not going to see that girl again.

14:30.450 --> 14:31.500
She's on her new cell phone,

14:31.540 --> 14:33.550
texting everyone she
knows about the prom.

14:33.950 --> 14:35.180
Like what they're wearing

14:35.180 --> 14:37.420
and who they're going with.

14:37.420 --> 14:39.150
Yup... That girl's gone.

14:39.440 --> 14:41.600
Mommy, there's a light in the TV.

14:51.760 --> 14:52.960
Is that good?

14:52.960 --> 14:53.660
Yeah.

15:02.340 --> 15:03.280
Mom?

15:04.100 --> 15:05.060
Aren't you going to sit?

15:06.130 --> 15:07.410
Yeah, yeah, of course.

15:09.550 --> 15:12.430
Hey, um, guys, do me
a favor. Scoot over.

15:12.700 --> 15:14.850
But, Mommy, you always
sit in the middle.

15:15.360 --> 15:17.790
Yeah... change is good.

15:17.860 --> 15:18.540
You know?

15:19.370 --> 15:21.350
A little change is good.

15:26.280 --> 15:27.660
Well, that was pretty awesome.

15:27.710 --> 15:31.480
I mean, I never thought I'd get to
save someone in lifeguard training.

15:32.820 --> 15:34.890
And, um, let me see...

15:35.530 --> 15:39.590
Oh, I rushed for 680 yards this
past season on the JV squad,

15:39.690 --> 15:41.570
which is way better than that guy.

15:42.170 --> 15:45.770
And... I just put some pretty pimp rims

15:45.820 --> 15:47.750
on my '02 Mazda Prot?

15:48.250 --> 15:49.840
But can you dance?

15:50.710 --> 15:52.170
Um, excuse me?

15:56.940 --> 15:58.810
I want to know if you can dance.

15:59.390 --> 16:01.740
I mean, you're pretty
and all and that's great,

16:02.840 --> 16:04.840
but this is the prom
we're talking about.

16:04.960 --> 16:06.660
If you want to be my
date, I need to know that

16:06.720 --> 16:08.920
you're not going to embarrass
me on the dance floor.

16:10.910 --> 16:11.680
Okay.

16:12.360 --> 16:14.620
Yeah, uh, I think I can dance.

16:16.440 --> 16:17.200
Show me.

16:18.920 --> 16:19.790
Now?

16:20.360 --> 16:22.950
By myself? Look...

16:23.490 --> 16:26.500
Number Four, if you don't want to,

16:26.630 --> 16:28.100
I'm sure that one of your competitors

16:28.150 --> 16:29.790
would love to show me what he's got.

16:29.870 --> 16:31.460
No, no-no-no,
it's cool.

16:32.410 --> 16:33.430
I'll dance.

16:54.380 --> 16:55.630
Is that what you had in mind,

16:55.830 --> 16:57.550
'cause I also know a little ballroom.

16:58.940 --> 17:00.210
No, it's, uh, it's fine.

17:00.270 --> 17:01.730
You can get back in
line. I'll let you know.

17:02.930 --> 17:03.980
Excuse me?

17:06.420 --> 17:07.460
Excuse me?

17:08.530 --> 17:09.630
These are closed auditions.

17:09.680 --> 17:11.589
You're really not
supposed to be in here.

17:13.180 --> 17:15.240
So this is how you use your gift?

17:15.990 --> 17:17.720
I'm sorry. Do I know you?

17:23.290 --> 17:27.329
Look, I'm having a really cool dream.

17:27.609 --> 17:30.300
And I know that you popped
into my head for a reason,

17:31.700 --> 17:33.750
but... whatever it is, do
you think it could wait?

17:35.320 --> 17:36.790
I'm sorry. I don't think so.

17:44.430 --> 17:45.120
Ariel!

17:45.410 --> 17:46.150
Ariel, what's wrong?

17:47.990 --> 17:48.960
Shh...

17:49.470 --> 17:51.220
Honey, honey, honey, what's wrong?

17:52.560 --> 17:53.550
This girl...

17:54.590 --> 17:55.760
I never saw her before.

17:55.800 --> 17:57.450
She popped up in my dream...

17:58.100 --> 18:00.170
and she killed herself.

18:01.790 --> 18:05.200
She put a gun in her mouth
and blew her brains out.

18:05.550 --> 18:06.650
Oh, honey.

18:07.600 --> 18:09.460
She seemed so angry at me.

18:09.910 --> 18:12.850
She asked me if this
is how I used my gift.

18:13.050 --> 18:14.020
What did she say?

18:14.250 --> 18:16.160
- No! 
- Mommy!

18:18.820 --> 18:19.810
Girls, what's going on?

18:20.110 --> 18:20.810
What's wrong?

18:21.400 --> 18:22.910
I was having this great dream.

18:24.220 --> 18:26.220
It was snowing right here in Phoenix.

18:26.450 --> 18:28.130
And they called off the schools.

18:28.470 --> 18:33.210
And everybody was going down
to the frozen lake to ice skate.

18:33.650 --> 18:35.640
And it was so much fun.

18:36.510 --> 18:38.200
But then, this older girl showed up.

18:38.450 --> 18:39.960
She looked at me and she said,

18:40.010 --> 18:42.440
"Is this how you use your gift?"

18:42.650 --> 18:44.430
And then she just started walking,

18:44.900 --> 18:47.270
walking right out into
the middle of the ice.

18:47.480 --> 18:49.170
And everybody kept yelling at her,

18:49.220 --> 18:50.820
'cause the ice was too thin.

18:51.260 --> 18:54.470
But she just kept
walking until it cracked.

18:55.610 --> 18:56.700
Then she fell in.

18:57.590 --> 18:59.740
She just fell in. She was gone.

19:02.360 --> 19:05.570
This girl-- she didn't
have black hair, did she?

19:06.350 --> 19:07.330
Yeah.

19:08.550 --> 19:11.220
Yeah, well, I, uh, I
dreamt about her, too.

19:12.240 --> 19:13.540
Whoa, well, wait a second.

19:13.590 --> 19:15.000
Is that even possible?

19:15.600 --> 19:16.370
It has to be.

19:16.740 --> 19:18.360
I just dreamt about her, too.

19:19.470 --> 19:20.800
I don't know. I don't get it.

19:21.260 --> 19:23.110
Why are Ariel and Bridgette

19:23.160 --> 19:25.570
dreaming about this young
girl killing herself?

19:25.770 --> 19:27.090
I mean, I dreamt about her last night,

19:27.170 --> 19:28.800
but it's not like I told them about it.

19:29.850 --> 19:33.080
Al, you're all... you're
apples from the same tree.

19:33.340 --> 19:34.030
Maybe...

19:34.550 --> 19:36.780
Maybe they sensed what you'd seen.

19:37.710 --> 19:39.330
I don't know. I don't understand.

19:40.040 --> 19:40.800
Who is this girl?

19:40.920 --> 19:42.470
Why is she so angry with us?

19:42.620 --> 19:45.010
Al, for all we know, she's nobody.

19:46.540 --> 19:47.790
You've never seen her before.

19:47.830 --> 19:49.560
The girls have never seen her before.

19:50.540 --> 19:52.320
Maybe she's not even a real person.

19:55.590 --> 19:57.050
Okay, forget I said that.

19:58.430 --> 19:59.360
Listen, Al,

19:59.690 --> 20:01.240
I'm coming off an all-nighter.

20:01.920 --> 20:05.450
I beg you... can we
throw a flag on the play

20:05.700 --> 20:08.060
and resume this
conversation in the morning?

20:09.400 --> 20:10.310
Begging is good.

20:10.350 --> 20:11.740
This begging works.

20:20.870 --> 20:21.690
Jennifer?

20:22.940 --> 20:23.810
You still awake?

20:26.940 --> 20:28.190
Yeah, I guess so.

20:30.500 --> 20:31.340
You doing okay?

20:33.420 --> 20:36.490
I mean, uh, this being your
first night and all, I...

20:37.550 --> 20:38.950
I figured you might be nervous.

20:41.080 --> 20:42.040
No, I'm okay.

20:43.210 --> 20:44.930
My wife was telling
me that this is, what--

20:45.550 --> 20:48.530
your third foster home?

20:50.390 --> 20:52.320
Well, I want you to know,

20:52.360 --> 20:54.510
I'm determined to make it your last.

20:56.600 --> 20:59.290
If anybody bothers
you at your new school,

21:00.350 --> 21:01.200
you tell me.

21:01.760 --> 21:05.850
If my missus starts to
lose her temper with you,

21:06.670 --> 21:07.410
now, you tell me.

21:07.460 --> 21:08.750
I mean, if you want anything...

21:09.920 --> 21:11.320
You need anything...

21:13.410 --> 21:14.330
You tell me.

21:16.810 --> 21:17.830
Does that sound good?

21:23.810 --> 21:24.680
Good.

21:26.430 --> 21:27.270
I'm glad.

21:32.410 --> 21:33.290
So, listen,

21:34.340 --> 21:36.890
if I'm gonna be looking out for you,

21:38.450 --> 21:39.580
making sure you're happy,

21:40.720 --> 21:44.090
I-I need you to look out for me...

21:46.750 --> 21:47.930
...make sure I'm happy.

21:53.190 --> 21:54.500
You got that, right?

22:20.160 --> 22:22.320
Yes, I'm looking for information

22:22.390 --> 22:23.210
on a Jennifer.

22:24.210 --> 22:25.800
Sorry, I don't have a last name.

22:26.820 --> 22:29.760
She's around 16 to 18 years of age,

22:29.820 --> 22:31.080
but that's just a guess.

22:33.920 --> 22:35.030
What do you mean there's
nothing you can tell me?

22:35.070 --> 22:37.700
I told you I'm with the
district attorney's office.

22:39.270 --> 22:40.670
No, I don't have a subpoena.

22:41.790 --> 22:43.320
Well, fine, I'll get a subpoena.

22:50.550 --> 22:51.640
What is this?

22:51.740 --> 22:53.450
Who took this? Is, is this ours?

22:53.490 --> 22:55.050
Is this a crime scene photograph?

22:56.730 --> 22:58.380
Not the way that you mean it, no.

22:58.460 --> 22:59.770
This came to us through the offices

22:59.830 --> 23:00.940
of the Arizona Observer.

23:02.180 --> 23:04.140
Apparently, our killers took pictures

23:04.210 --> 23:06.850
and wanted to share them
with the Observer's readers.

23:06.900 --> 23:09.530
This will be on the front
page of the newspaper tonight

23:09.590 --> 23:10.790
and I'm sure it will make its way

23:10.840 --> 23:13.020
onto all the evening newscasts.

23:13.300 --> 23:14.940
And this message--
"More to come"--

23:15.070 --> 23:16.430
it's written in blood, isn't it?

23:17.100 --> 23:20.730
It's their blood--
the Prescotts.

23:21.610 --> 23:23.410
According to the lab,
each letter can be matched

23:23.450 --> 23:25.090
to a different member of the family.

23:26.390 --> 23:28.280
But that aside, the photo
and the envelope it came in

23:28.320 --> 23:30.390
were as clean as the room
where we found the family--

23:30.510 --> 23:32.540
no prints, no fibers, no DNA.

23:32.990 --> 23:36.060
Meaning we're exactly
where we were yesterday,

23:36.930 --> 23:38.970
only now we're poised
to have a citywide panic

23:39.010 --> 23:40.220
and we know that whoever did this

23:40.260 --> 23:41.550
is planning on doing it again.

24:08.500 --> 24:09.210
Yeah.

24:09.820 --> 24:11.350
Keith, did you have the locks...?

24:12.090 --> 24:13.720
- Mr. Burroughs.
- Joe.

24:13.970 --> 24:16.020
Forgive me, sir, I didn't
realize you were in here.

24:16.070 --> 24:16.970
I didn't realize anyone was in here.

24:17.010 --> 24:17.740
No, i-it's all right.

24:17.790 --> 24:18.700
Are you having a problem with something?

24:18.760 --> 24:21.150
No, it's, it's... I-I
don't know, it's...

24:21.210 --> 24:22.280
It'll wait till you two are finished.

24:22.330 --> 24:23.220
No, it's okay.

24:23.280 --> 24:24.520
If you have a problem, just spit it out.

24:24.690 --> 24:26.000
No, it's, it's not a big deal, really.

24:26.110 --> 24:26.830
It's just, uh,

24:28.520 --> 24:31.070
uh, I just got back from
lunch and my office is locked.

24:31.660 --> 24:32.620
My key doesn't work.

24:33.080 --> 24:34.640
So, I just talked to Jason.

24:34.690 --> 24:36.770
He said that he saw a maintenance
guy changing the locks,

24:36.830 --> 24:37.650
and when he asked him about it

24:37.680 --> 24:40.100
he said that, uh, you told him to do it?

24:40.330 --> 24:41.460
That's right. I did.

24:42.810 --> 24:44.370
I can't have you in there anymore.

24:45.100 --> 24:45.790
Excuse me?

24:46.020 --> 24:47.610
I can't have you sitting in there.

24:49.040 --> 24:50.580
You may just want to stay home.

24:52.360 --> 24:53.630
Really? Why is that?

24:54.300 --> 24:59.290
Oh, uh, I noticed when I came
in very early this morning that,

24:59.350 --> 25:03.980
that the ideas were flowing
very freely, very easily.

25:04.520 --> 25:07.120
And, uh, and then when you came in,

25:07.620 --> 25:10.390
there's something about you
being in that office that...

25:11.370 --> 25:15.350
oh, everything just
started getting backed up.

25:15.910 --> 25:17.720
But then when you went to lunch...

25:20.500 --> 25:22.120
The flow came back?

25:22.220 --> 25:23.110
It did, yeah.

25:23.260 --> 25:23.790
I see.

25:23.790 --> 25:28.380
So you think I'm-I'm...
constipating your thinking?

25:28.520 --> 25:29.670
I don't think. I know.

25:29.790 --> 25:32.940
This is a problem
that's easily solvable.

25:33.550 --> 25:35.040
We'll just find Mr. Dubois here

25:35.070 --> 25:38.880
an office that doesn't...
interfere with your flow.

25:39.360 --> 25:40.770
At least until this project is done.

25:41.020 --> 25:42.340
Super. Super.

25:43.270 --> 25:44.710
Well, you look like you're
making progress here,

25:44.740 --> 25:46.310
so maybe I'll just take Joe

25:46.350 --> 25:48.080
and we'll go on a little office hunt.

25:48.200 --> 25:49.020
Sounds good.

25:49.320 --> 25:50.680
- Sound good?
- It sounds good.

25:50.820 --> 25:51.580
All right.

25:55.780 --> 25:56.530
Listen. Don't worry,

25:56.550 --> 25:57.860
I'll get maintenance
back down here in a jiffy

25:57.890 --> 25:59.500
to fix that lock, okay?

25:59.640 --> 26:00.580
Well, wait a second.

26:00.610 --> 26:01.540
What the hell was that all about?

26:01.690 --> 26:03.400
Hey, the man thought you
were screwing with his flow.

26:03.700 --> 26:04.490
What do you want me to do?

26:04.680 --> 26:07.100
I need him. I need that flow.

26:10.660 --> 26:12.760
It was surreal how
Burroughs just sat there

26:12.940 --> 26:15.760
coddling Keith like he's
some sort of spoiled child.

26:17.020 --> 26:19.540
Well, it sounds like
Burroughs is determined

26:19.600 --> 26:20.750
to have Keith finish what he's doing,

26:20.750 --> 26:22.000
no matter what it takes.

26:22.080 --> 26:23.720
I know, but now I spend my day

26:23.720 --> 26:25.690
sneaking in and out of my office,

26:26.200 --> 26:27.980
living in fear that
Keith is going to walk by

26:28.010 --> 26:29.910
and realize I'm still sitting in there

26:30.420 --> 26:32.630
interfering with his clear channel.

26:33.300 --> 26:34.990
Stopping up his flow.

26:36.420 --> 26:37.370
I'm a grown man.

26:38.790 --> 26:40.530
I feel ridiculous.

26:42.050 --> 26:44.350
If that's Keith, tell
him I'm not leaving town.

26:44.650 --> 26:47.180
I don't care how
constipated his brain gets.

26:48.300 --> 26:49.000
Hello.

26:51.280 --> 26:52.100
Oh, no.

26:54.750 --> 26:56.170
Yeah, of course.

26:56.230 --> 26:57.220
Text me the address.

26:58.760 --> 26:59.690
What's going on? Who was that?

27:00.360 --> 27:01.540
It was Devalos.

27:02.970 --> 27:04.660
They found another family.

27:04.770 --> 27:06.260
Same thing, they're all dead.

27:06.400 --> 27:08.370
Blood's gone, posed for pictures.

27:08.410 --> 27:09.880
He wants me to go take a look.

27:17.430 --> 27:18.770
You're looking at the Andersons.

27:19.420 --> 27:21.320
An hour and a half ago,
the lady across the street

27:21.370 --> 27:23.110
saw a strange white van in the driveway.

27:23.280 --> 27:24.410
She called 911.

27:24.920 --> 27:26.580
Patrolman was here within ten minutes.

27:27.950 --> 27:29.020
He found the family in here.

27:29.600 --> 27:30.940
No mess in the kitchen this time.

27:31.880 --> 27:33.020
No blood again either.

27:34.290 --> 27:36.400
Hard to figure out how they
get it out of the bodies

27:36.450 --> 27:38.550
without even a trace of it
appearing anywhere in the house.

27:38.630 --> 27:41.290
But anyway, we're guessing
the killer or killers

27:41.780 --> 27:44.340
just bolted as soon they
heard the squad car roll up.

27:45.470 --> 27:47.220
Yeah, want to come over here?

28:25.960 --> 28:27.570
Stop him! He's getting away!

28:27.840 --> 28:28.680
Stop him!

28:38.570 --> 28:39.250
Turn him around.

28:42.530 --> 28:43.380
Let me see his face.

28:57.750 --> 28:58.670
They processed her.

28:59.130 --> 29:00.340
Brought her down for questioning.

29:00.660 --> 29:01.690
Do we know anything yet?

29:01.800 --> 29:03.530
Well, we know her name.

29:04.600 --> 29:05.440
Jennifer Whitten.

29:06.140 --> 29:07.630
We know that she's 17 years old.

29:07.770 --> 29:09.160
We know she turns 18 tomorrow.

29:09.290 --> 29:11.260
And we know she's homeless.

29:14.170 --> 29:15.600
Turns out she's a ward of the state.

29:15.660 --> 29:16.730
Or at least she's supposed to be.

29:16.990 --> 29:19.470
She and her parents were in a
tragic car accident two years ago.

29:19.530 --> 29:20.930
She survived, they didn't.

29:21.130 --> 29:23.310
Since then, she's cycled
through three foster homes

29:23.380 --> 29:24.230
before she ran away,

29:24.230 --> 29:25.010
took to the streets.

29:25.210 --> 29:26.150
Think I already knew that.

29:26.300 --> 29:27.030
Excuse me?

29:27.140 --> 29:28.620
I dreamt about her the other night.

29:28.810 --> 29:30.150
I couldn't figure out why.

29:30.270 --> 29:31.190
I still can't.

29:31.870 --> 29:32.990
Well, let's see what we can find out.

29:35.830 --> 29:36.820
So you can't tell me why

29:36.820 --> 29:37.910
you were in that house tonight?

29:38.330 --> 29:39.710
No, that's not what I said.

29:39.770 --> 29:41.160
I said I won't tell you

29:41.160 --> 29:42.860
why I was in that house tonight.

29:51.020 --> 29:52.140
Have you seen those people before?

29:53.100 --> 29:54.390
That's the Prescott family.

29:54.390 --> 29:55.470
They were killed two nights ago.

29:55.540 --> 29:57.350
Drained of their blood. Posed.

29:57.980 --> 30:00.230
Just like the family whose
house we found you in tonight.

30:00.880 --> 30:02.230
This ringing any bells for you?

30:03.560 --> 30:05.240
I'm sorry. I don't
know what to tell you.

30:05.280 --> 30:07.540
I've never seen these
people before in my life.

30:07.910 --> 30:09.010
You're sure about that?

30:27.520 --> 30:29.220
You know what? I'm going
to have you arrested.

30:30.530 --> 30:31.300
You're going to what?

30:31.550 --> 30:32.260
You heard me.

30:32.840 --> 30:34.370
I may be poor, I may be only 17,

30:34.420 --> 30:37.450
but I've seen enough television
to be pretty aware of my rights.

30:37.720 --> 30:39.000
I want a public defender.

30:39.030 --> 30:41.920
And I'm not answering any more
questions until you get me one.

30:54.280 --> 30:55.140
Thoughts?

30:56.120 --> 30:57.840
Young, female,
destitute--

30:57.890 --> 31:00.460
she doesn't exactly fit the profile
of a serial killer, does she?

31:01.150 --> 31:02.600
No, she does not.

31:03.120 --> 31:05.550
And then there's all those
pesky unanswered questions

31:05.610 --> 31:07.050
like where's the murder weapon?

31:08.120 --> 31:09.500
What did she do with all the blood?

31:09.620 --> 31:13.520
Where's the camera she used
to take pictures of her victims

31:13.570 --> 31:14.740
once she posed them?

31:14.940 --> 31:16.100
She's lying, by the way.

31:16.660 --> 31:18.130
I saw that when she was talking to you.

31:18.730 --> 31:22.240
She was there, standing inside
the first victims' house--

31:22.280 --> 31:23.200
the Prescotts.

31:23.930 --> 31:26.320
She lied when she said
she'd never seen them before.

31:27.940 --> 31:28.910
You sure about this?

31:32.180 --> 31:32.780
Well...

31:36.180 --> 31:39.360
then I guess I send Forensics
back to the Prescotts

31:39.400 --> 31:40.490
with a fine-tooth comb.

31:41.370 --> 31:43.000
Hopefully they can
find something, anything

31:43.070 --> 31:45.970
that connects Miss Whitten
to that scene as well.

31:47.620 --> 31:49.120
Because even though we found her

31:49.350 --> 31:51.200
hiding in the Andersons' home,

31:51.780 --> 31:53.940
the truth is, while we have
a hell of a case against her

31:53.980 --> 31:55.280
for breaking and entering,

31:55.580 --> 31:58.850
there's no evidence whatsoever
that ties her to these murders.

32:00.190 --> 32:03.250
I don't know about you
but I need some sleep.

32:16.970 --> 32:18.710
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

32:19.820 --> 32:20.630
Mr. Burroughs...

32:22.200 --> 32:23.010
I was just...

32:23.140 --> 32:24.440
I was just trying to
get back to my office

32:24.490 --> 32:25.560
before Keith saw me.

32:25.620 --> 32:26.660
I wouldn't worry about it.

32:26.700 --> 32:27.640
Keith's not here today.

32:28.710 --> 32:29.430
You're kidding?

32:29.890 --> 32:32.120
Well, that's fantastic.

32:32.550 --> 32:33.930
Well, I'm glad
somebody's happy about it.

33:38.420 --> 33:39.110
Jenn?

33:40.530 --> 33:41.280
You up?

33:47.150 --> 33:47.890
I...

33:48.260 --> 33:49.930
found this.

33:50.560 --> 33:52.530
Somebody took, like,
two bites and chucked it.

33:53.560 --> 33:54.560
Nicky, what if I told you

33:54.630 --> 33:56.780
I know a place where we
could get some real food?

34:00.340 --> 34:01.570
I don't know about this, Jenn.

34:02.380 --> 34:04.160
This is a nice place.

34:04.280 --> 34:05.520
Even the mailbox is nice.

34:05.570 --> 34:07.280
They gotta have an alarm, right?

34:07.500 --> 34:08.139
It doesn't matter.

34:08.190 --> 34:09.389
I'll just bust a window or something.

34:09.469 --> 34:10.320
It won't go off.

34:11.820 --> 34:12.469
What?

34:13.130 --> 34:14.630
I'm telling you it's
not a problem, okay?

34:14.679 --> 34:16.489
So just keep watch

34:16.600 --> 34:18.010
and, stay here, okay?

35:12.730 --> 35:14.270
You dream things, don't you?

35:17.820 --> 35:20.000
That's how you knew how
to get into those houses.

35:20.430 --> 35:21.450
You saw him do it.

35:21.500 --> 35:24.300
You saw him disable those alarm systems.

35:24.520 --> 35:26.060
That's how you knew it was safe.

35:27.610 --> 35:29.290
You were looking for food, weren't you?

35:30.950 --> 35:31.940
Tell me I'm wrong.

35:32.380 --> 35:33.810
I'm not telling you anything.

35:34.350 --> 35:35.740
My lawyer said I don't have to speak

35:35.800 --> 35:37.300
to anyone without him around,

35:37.350 --> 35:39.870
so that's what I'm gonna do: not speak.

35:42.040 --> 35:42.710
Okay.

35:44.370 --> 35:45.680
Then I'll do the talking.

35:47.690 --> 35:49.200
I know something about this.

35:51.240 --> 35:52.440
I dream things, too.

35:53.790 --> 35:55.200
Except in my dreams...

35:56.110 --> 35:58.670
they usually come to me from
people who are already dead.

35:59.830 --> 36:00.970
They want to show me something.

36:02.710 --> 36:05.320
But your dreams seem to come
from someone who's alive.

36:05.360 --> 36:08.070
It's as if you're seeing
things through their eyes.

36:13.480 --> 36:14.000
What?!

36:14.040 --> 36:16.710
The fact that this person
is on a deadly rampage

36:16.810 --> 36:19.470
slaughtering whole families,
it doesn't matter to you?

36:20.530 --> 36:21.970
People die every day.

36:22.970 --> 36:24.940
What? The fact that they're
families makes it worse?

36:24.980 --> 36:27.400
A family is just a thing
that you're part of,

36:27.500 --> 36:28.610
and then you're not.

36:33.780 --> 36:35.300
What do you want from me?

36:36.490 --> 36:38.460
I want you to tell me what you see.

36:40.770 --> 36:43.690
I see a lady who won't
take no for an answer.

36:48.220 --> 36:49.290
If you change your mind...

36:51.980 --> 36:53.140
I'm gonna give you my card

36:53.830 --> 36:55.070
and my home phone number.

37:02.250 --> 37:03.690
If you change your mind.

37:05.060 --> 37:05.990
I won't.

37:20.920 --> 37:22.380
Joe, you in there? It's Dan Burroughs.

37:22.670 --> 37:25.130
Yeah! Sorry.

37:29.190 --> 37:30.830
Hi, Mr. Burroughs.

37:33.280 --> 37:35.090
You haven't seen Keith, have you?

37:35.140 --> 37:37.080
Me? No, no.

37:37.120 --> 37:38.650
I've been trying to avoid him, actually.

37:39.840 --> 37:40.800
Something wrong?

37:40.980 --> 37:42.050
Well, he's

37:42.330 --> 37:44.240
sort of gone MIA, disappeared.

37:44.320 --> 37:45.790
We're guessing he's gone off his meds.

37:46.360 --> 37:47.150
His meds?

37:47.770 --> 37:48.960
Keith is on medication?

37:49.450 --> 37:50.240
He's supposed to be,

37:50.280 --> 37:53.540
but now he's gone out
of touch, isn't here.

37:53.980 --> 37:54.860
Doesn't seem to be at home.

37:54.910 --> 37:57.430
He's supposed to co-lead
a presentation for

37:57.430 --> 37:59.950
the Department of Defense on
this biofuels project tomorrow.

38:01.190 --> 38:01.890
Yeah,

38:02.020 --> 38:04.360
What's your tomorrow look like?

38:04.430 --> 38:05.320
Do you have a suit?

38:08.050 --> 38:08.760
Mr. Burroughs,

38:08.790 --> 38:10.650
I consider myself a pretty smart man,

38:11.230 --> 38:12.330
but I'm not a mind-reader.

38:12.540 --> 38:16.060
Keith kept most of his work on this
project pretty close to the vest.

38:16.270 --> 38:17.600
I wish I could help you out.

38:17.810 --> 38:18.970
I'll send you home with
everything you need:

38:18.990 --> 38:20.290
all the studies, all the trials.

38:20.360 --> 38:21.740
Anything you don't understand,

38:21.790 --> 38:23.780
my lab guys will explain
to you in the morning.

38:23.940 --> 38:25.630
tomorrow afternoon,
I'm wagering you'll be

38:25.670 --> 38:27.090
the second-smartest guy in the country

38:27.130 --> 38:28.810
on the subject of ultralight biofuels.

38:28.850 --> 38:31.040
Or at least you'll seem
like the second-smartest guy.

38:32.010 --> 38:33.090
I appreciate this.

38:37.130 --> 38:38.150
They just released her.

38:39.810 --> 38:40.630
I'm sorry?

38:41.020 --> 38:42.970
Jennifer Whitten.
They just released her.

38:43.010 --> 38:43.950
I thought you'd like to know.

38:44.100 --> 38:45.650
But I-I just saw her this morning.

38:45.690 --> 38:47.730
I thought we were holding
her in protective custody.

38:47.760 --> 38:49.610
She's a minor. She
doesn't have any parents.

38:49.640 --> 38:50.240
They can't just...

38:50.270 --> 38:51.240
She turned 18 today.

38:52.030 --> 38:53.280
That, coupled with the fact

38:53.340 --> 38:55.670
that we can't find even a
trace of Miss Whitten's DNA

38:55.720 --> 38:56.700
at the original crime scene

38:56.730 --> 38:58.490
means we just can't hold her any longer.

38:59.080 --> 39:00.490
They've got her on
breaking and entering,

39:00.520 --> 39:02.780
but the court isn't gonna hear
that until three months from now,

39:02.820 --> 39:05.970
so her public defender filed
a motion on her behalf and...

39:07.360 --> 39:07.990
Look,

39:08.260 --> 39:10.990
I know you think she knows
more than she's admitting,

39:11.030 --> 39:12.110
but there's nothing I can do.

39:12.150 --> 39:13.220
She's back on the street.

39:14.550 --> 39:15.330
I'm sorry.

40:59.810 --> 41:00.900
No.

41:01.890 --> 41:02.610
Hello?

41:03.660 --> 41:04.840
Jennifer, is that you?

41:05.960 --> 41:06.960
Are you all right?

41:07.090 --> 41:08.140
What's going on?

41:09.150 --> 41:10.450
Are you in a public place?

41:11.680 --> 41:12.680
I know where that is.

41:13.580 --> 41:14.660
Stay where there are people.

41:14.710 --> 41:15.610
I'll come and get you.

41:16.310 --> 41:17.140
Coming to get who?

41:18.080 --> 41:19.100
Who are you coming to get?

41:20.040 --> 41:21.090
Or leaving to get?

41:21.770 --> 41:22.550
Allison?!

41:24.680 --> 41:25.410
That's all right.

41:25.450 --> 41:27.230
You'll tell me when you get back.

00:00.500 --> 00:02.000
