30:23.734 --> 30:26.400
just have to worry about
yourself right now, and just be

30:26.400 --> 30:30.000
calm, because...
>> KHLOE (crying): I can't be

30:30.000 --> 30:32.433
calm.
Not right now.

30:32.433 --> 30:35.100
>> KIM: Okay.
>> KHLOE: I'm trying to figure

30:35.100 --> 30:37.100
it out.
I'll call you back.

30:37.100 --> 30:40.333
>> KIM: Okay, bye.
I mean, I definitely feel

30:40.333 --> 30:42.567
helpless, because she's
confused, she doesn't know what

30:42.567 --> 30:46.567
to do, and we don't really know
what to do, but we want to be

30:46.567 --> 30:50.600
there for her.
And honestly, it's like I'm in

30:50.600 --> 30:52.700
shock.
We love Tristan.

30:52.700 --> 30:55.033
Like, this is just nothing that
we suspected.

30:55.033 --> 30:58.700
We thought she finally found
her, you know, Prince Charming

30:58.700 --> 31:06.100
happy ending, and then, (bleep).
It's just, why her?

31:06.100 --> 31:12.633
Like, it just, it really, really
sucks.

31:12.633 --> 31:14.467
>> SCOTT: They're both in the
same house right now?

31:14.467 --> 31:16.066
>> KENDALL: No, she kicked him
out.

31:16.066 --> 31:18.200
He's, like, he left the house.
We're trying to get her to come

31:18.200 --> 31:20.734
home.
>> SCOTT: (bleep), man.

31:20.734 --> 31:23.333
What-- by the way-- what the
(bleep) he even doing out in

31:23.333 --> 31:25.066
the streets right now like that
anyway?

31:25.066 --> 31:26.600
>> KENDALL: Right.
>> SCOTT: Like, I mean, she is

31:26.600 --> 31:30.066
about to pop off, like...
Got to chill at home for a

31:30.066 --> 31:33.767
minute.
(slurps)

31:33.767 --> 31:37.600
I've really turned into such a
gentleman.

31:37.600 --> 31:39.433
♪ ♪

31:48.066 --> 31:49.600
>> KIM: You have an Instagram
account?

31:49.600 --> 31:51.333
>> MJ: Yes.
>> KIM: What is your Instagram

31:51.333 --> 31:54.467
account?
>> MJ: Kimkardashian.com.

31:54.467 --> 31:56.367
(both chuckle)
>> KIM: But what's your

31:56.367 --> 31:58.500
Instagram name?
>> MJ: I just push "Instagram."

31:58.500 --> 31:59.767
>> KIM: Oh.
>> MJ: I have the app.

31:59.767 --> 32:01.066
>> KIM: Yeah.
>> MJ: (chuckles)

32:01.066 --> 32:02.767
Isn't that what you do?
>> KRIS: Hey, Mom.

32:02.767 --> 32:04.400
>> MJ: Hi.
>> KRIS: You look cute.

32:04.400 --> 32:07.567
>> MJ: Well, thank you.
>> KRIS: Hi, Kimbo.

32:07.567 --> 32:09.500
>> KIM: Hi, Mom.
>> MJ: Love your shoes, Krissy.

32:09.500 --> 32:11.633
>> KRIS: Thank you.
>> MJ: They're so cute.

32:11.633 --> 32:13.767
>> KRIS: Thanks.
>> KIM: Oh, so, I called Khloe

32:13.767 --> 32:16.567
today, and I was like,
"Honestly, so many more stories

32:16.567 --> 32:19.433
have come out, so many friends
are calling me with, like, so

32:19.433 --> 32:22.033
many more things."
>> MJ: I just found out, so I've

32:22.033 --> 32:25.100
just, you know, I'm still
crying, so I can't...

32:25.100 --> 32:27.633
>> KIM: Oh, you just found out.
>> MJ: Yeah.

32:27.633 --> 32:29.133
>> KIM: Oh.
>> MJ: I'm really sad.

32:29.133 --> 32:31.633
Ruined my makeup.
>> KIM: Yeah.

32:31.633 --> 32:35.100
>> MJ: All the way over here.
>> KIM: You know, I told her,

32:35.100 --> 32:37.567
"What is, what are you gonna get
out of him?"

32:37.567 --> 32:40.166
I go, "Think about it.
You're gonna be worried and

32:40.166 --> 32:42.533
nervous and have an insecure
life, 'cause if he's not

32:42.533 --> 32:44.400
faithful now..."
>> MJ: He'll never change.

32:44.400 --> 32:47.734
>> KIM: Yeah, he'll never
change.

32:47.734 --> 32:50.200
When one thing comes out, you
kind of hope, like, "Okay, well,

32:50.200 --> 32:54.000
maybe the video's old or maybe
it's a misunderstanding, maybe

32:54.000 --> 32:58.533
something," 'cause a picture
doesn't always tell the full

32:58.533 --> 33:01.467
story.
But then, you know, two more

33:01.467 --> 33:06.266
stories come out.
This is just, like, crazy.

33:06.266 --> 33:09.166
And now, you know, you know it's
true.

33:09.166 --> 33:12.266
>> MJ: Find-find a different
type.

33:12.266 --> 33:14.667
You know?
>> KIM: Yeah.

33:14.667 --> 33:17.000
>> MJ: An accountant or
something.

33:17.000 --> 33:19.700
>> KIM: Yeah. Preach, Grandma.
>> MJ: A preacher.

33:19.700 --> 33:22.033
>> KIM: An accountant.
(both laugh)

33:22.033 --> 33:24.467
>> KRIS: Okay, so I need your
attention.

33:24.467 --> 33:27.100
>> KIM: Yeah?
>> KRIS: This university-- Brown

33:27.100 --> 33:29.500
University-- they have a class
called "Keeping Up with Keeping

33:29.500 --> 33:31.767
Up."
>> KIM: Yeah.

33:31.767 --> 33:34.100
>> MJ: How cute.
>> KRIS: And I'm gonna surprise

33:34.100 --> 33:36.567
the class by Skyping in.
Then I thought what I could do

33:36.567 --> 33:39.233
is say that you're here, too...
>> KIM: Okay.

33:39.233 --> 33:41.600
>> KRIS: ...and surprise you,
and MJ can pop in.

33:41.600 --> 33:44.734
>> MJ: They'll be so excited.
>> KRIS: Where is Kourtney?

33:44.734 --> 33:46.734
>> MJ: Upstairs getting her
makeup.

33:46.734 --> 33:50.033
>> KRIS: So I'll get on with
them now.

33:50.033 --> 33:52.033
>> KIM: I can't believe they
have a class like that.

33:52.033 --> 33:54.033
>> KRIS: Isn't that wild?
>> KIM: Yeah, to get credit for

33:54.033 --> 33:58.200
school on our show-- like,
that's crazy.

33:58.200 --> 34:01.600
>> KRIS: The timing isn't great
with what's going on with Khloe.

34:01.600 --> 34:03.734
>> KIM: But we can't really
reschedule the call, so, if

34:03.734 --> 34:05.734
anything, it's like a good
distraction to get...

34:05.734 --> 34:08.000
>> KRIS: For sure.
>> KIM: ...you know, our minds

34:08.000 --> 34:11.066
off of everything.
(laughter)

34:11.066 --> 34:13.500
>> KRIS: Hi, guys.
(indistinct chatter)

34:13.500 --> 34:16.734
What are you...?
Oh, my God, it's all women?

34:16.734 --> 34:20.133
>> ALL: Yes!
>> KRIS: Oh, that's so cool.

34:20.133 --> 34:22.533
Well, hi.
Happy Wednesday.

34:22.533 --> 34:24.734
>> KIM: I could probably help
out with some reports.

34:24.734 --> 34:28.767
(laughter)
That's crazy that you guys

34:28.767 --> 34:31.500
actually get credit for this.
>> WOMAN: It's not that crazy,

34:31.500 --> 34:33.734
because you guys are just so
relevant to American culture

34:33.734 --> 34:36.533
that... and I think really, it
makes a lot of sense for us to

34:36.533 --> 34:39.200
be studying you guys.
So, in general, why do you feel

34:39.200 --> 34:42.233
like your family's become such
polarizing figures?

34:42.233 --> 34:44.633
Where do you think that some of
that both positivity and

34:44.633 --> 34:47.100
negativity comes from?
And then, how do you, I guess,

34:47.100 --> 34:49.533
deal with that?
>> KIM: Sometimes I feel torn

34:49.533 --> 34:51.567
about it, 'cause sometimes,
like, if I post a photo...

34:51.567 --> 34:54.300
>> KOURTNEY: Hi, guys.
>> WOMAN: Oh, my God.

34:54.300 --> 34:56.633
>> KIM: Welcome to the party.
>> KRIS: There she is.

34:56.633 --> 34:59.166
>> KOURTNEY: Sorry. I was
glamming.

34:59.166 --> 35:02.233
>> KRIS: You're late, but go on.
>> KIM: Well, I think we've gone

35:02.233 --> 35:05.767
through every crazy thing that
you could possibly imagine, and

35:05.767 --> 35:07.767
we've shared that.
I think just people can relate

35:07.767 --> 35:10.767
to that, whether they want us to
win or not.

35:10.767 --> 35:14.300
I mean, it's so funny to me, the
people that are so bothered.

35:14.300 --> 35:16.767
Like, I get it.
If it's not your thing, like,

35:16.767 --> 35:19.233
it's not your thing, so don't...
You know, change the channel or

35:19.233 --> 35:21.233
whatever, but at the end of the
day, people can criticize all

35:21.233 --> 35:23.667
day long.
We have each other.

35:23.667 --> 35:25.667
(phone ringing)
>> KOURTNEY: Is that your phone?

35:25.667 --> 35:27.667
>> KRIS: I don't know.
>> KIM: No. Um...

35:27.667 --> 35:29.667
You don't know your ringtone?
>> KRIS: It's like everybody

35:29.667 --> 35:31.667
else's.
>> KOURTNEY: That's not

35:31.667 --> 35:33.667
everybody else's.
>> KIM: It's not everyone else's

35:33.667 --> 35:35.667
ringtone.
That's a really annoying, loud

35:35.667 --> 35:37.667
ringtone.
>> KRIS: So, it's annoying,

35:37.667 --> 35:39.667
okay.
>> MJ: So they are normal.

35:39.667 --> 35:41.667
>> KRIS: Just push the button.
>> WOMAN: We're wondering how

35:41.667 --> 35:43.667
you balance your
responsibilities as both a

35:43.667 --> 35:46.000
character on your show and also
a producer?

35:46.000 --> 35:48.266
>> KIM: Kourtney?
>> KRIS: I think as far as...

35:48.266 --> 35:50.266
What? You want to answer that?
>> KOURTNEY: They said you have

35:50.266 --> 35:52.567
to check your phone right this
second.

35:52.567 --> 35:55.266
>> KRIS: Oh.
Okay, I got to go.

35:55.266 --> 35:57.333
She's gonna answer that
question.

35:57.333 --> 36:00.133
I'll be right back.
>> KIM: Okay.

36:00.133 --> 36:04.166
>> KOURTNEY: Um, I think...
I mean, we're always thinking

36:04.166 --> 36:07.033
of, like... What?
>> KIM: Kourtney's not that good

36:07.033 --> 36:09.166
at this role.
>> KOURTNEY: At producing?

36:09.166 --> 36:11.200
(laughter)
No. I mean, people are always

36:11.200 --> 36:13.200
coming up with fun things...
>> KRIS: Hey. No, but I can try

36:13.200 --> 36:17.066
and get another plane.
Why? Are you contracting?

36:17.066 --> 36:19.333
Ah, (bleep).
Okay, we should have come last

36:19.333 --> 36:23.200
night.
I knew it!

36:23.200 --> 36:26.567
All right. No, I'm-I'm good.
I'm just, I'm gonna be calm.

36:26.567 --> 36:29.567
I just, let me figure it out
and see how fast we can get out

36:29.567 --> 36:34.700
of here.
She's in labor, like, full-blown

36:34.700 --> 36:37.367
labor, and I'm in charge of
bringing the doctor.

36:37.367 --> 36:40.300
Ah, (bleep).
I mean, what's gonna happen if

36:40.300 --> 36:43.333
Dr. A isn't there to deliver the
baby?

36:43.333 --> 36:45.600
We've got to get there right
now.

36:45.600 --> 36:47.467
It just doesn't get any worse.

36:56.367 --> 37:00.600
>> KRIS: Hi. So, listen, Khloe's
in labor, so here's the thing.

37:00.600 --> 37:02.734
Can you get to the airport by
5:00?

37:02.734 --> 37:05.333
>> ALIABADI: Let me... Yeah.
Let me go see my last patient,

37:05.333 --> 37:08.633
and I'll run out.
>> KRIS: Okay. Bye.

37:08.633 --> 37:10.767
(whispering): I got to go.
Wrap it up.

37:10.767 --> 37:13.066
I got to go.
>> KIM: Okay.

37:13.066 --> 37:15.233
>> KRIS: Do you want to just
pause them, or...?

37:15.233 --> 37:17.233
>> KIM: Okay. One sec.
>> KRIS: I can't wait one

37:17.233 --> 37:19.734
second.
>> KIM: Um, we have to go, but,

37:19.734 --> 37:23.066
um, we are so excited that you
guys... this is actually a real

37:23.066 --> 37:25.367
course.
>> KRIS: She's in labor.

37:25.367 --> 37:27.500
>> MJ: She's what?
>> KRIS: I think she's in labor.

37:27.500 --> 37:29.533
>> MJ: I thought so, with this.
>> KRIS: Yeah, yeah, so I got to

37:29.533 --> 37:31.767
go get on a plane.
>> WOMAN: Oh, thank you so much.

37:31.767 --> 37:35.000
>> KOURTNEY: Okay, bye, guys.
>> KIM: Thanks, you guys. Bye.

37:35.000 --> 37:37.000
>> KRIS: Okay, I got to go.
I just moved the plane up, and I

37:37.000 --> 37:39.000
think she's in labor.
>> KIM: Okay, well, to when?

37:39.000 --> 37:40.767
>> KRIS: I knew we should have
gone last night, I knew it.

37:40.767 --> 37:43.000
>> KIM: Do you want me to go
with you?

37:43.000 --> 37:45.000
>> KRIS: No, you come in a
couple of days.

37:45.000 --> 37:47.000
I'm going, I'm bringing the
doctor.

37:47.000 --> 37:49.100
>> KIM: I'll go.
Like, I don't care.

37:49.100 --> 37:51.367
>> KRIS: Uh, the only thing that
frightens me is that she's gonna

37:51.367 --> 37:53.367
have this baby before I can get
there, and then she's giving

37:53.367 --> 37:58.266
birth alone.
>> KIM: Hey, are you okay?

37:58.266 --> 38:00.400
>> KHLOE: Yeah.
>> KIM: Um, how are you feeling?

38:00.400 --> 38:02.533
Do you want me to come with Mom,
'cause I could go?

38:02.533 --> 38:04.433
>> KRIS: I got to go.
Bye, everybody.

38:04.433 --> 38:06.433
I love you.
>> KHLOE: Should the

38:06.433 --> 38:08.500
contractions feel like period
cramps?

38:08.500 --> 38:10.433
>> KOURTNEY: Yeah.
>> KIM: I'm here with Kourt and

38:10.433 --> 38:12.400
Grandma.
>> KHLOE: But they keep going

38:12.400 --> 38:15.333
from different times, so I don't
understand if I'm feeling them.

38:15.333 --> 38:17.433
>> KOURTNEY: Write it down.
>> KHLOE: Oh, no, one was at

38:17.433 --> 38:19.567
9:43, one was at 8:21, one was
at 10:00 something.

38:19.567 --> 38:21.700
>> KIM: I feel like I should go.
>> KHLOE: 9:28.

38:21.700 --> 38:24.066
>> KOURTNEY: Yeah.
>> KIM: Okay.

38:24.066 --> 38:26.000
>> KHLOE: And now, another one
was at 3:50.

38:26.000 --> 38:29.400
>> KIM: Okay, I'm gonna run and,
um, get my bag, and I'm gonna

38:29.400 --> 38:31.533
come with Mom.
I'll call you right back.

38:31.533 --> 38:34.133
>> KOURTNEY: Call Corey.
>> KIM: I'm on my way. Bye.

38:34.133 --> 38:37.000
You know, when there's something
crazy that goes on in our

38:37.000 --> 38:41.066
family, we just always drop
everything that we're doing and

38:41.066 --> 38:47.033
go be supportive to them.
I obviously wanted to go to my

38:47.033 --> 38:50.533
reunion, and I wanted to make
both work, but since my reunion

38:50.533 --> 38:53.633
is in two days, it's like, game
over, it's doesn't matter.

38:53.633 --> 38:56.734
I'm gonna go to Cleveland and be
there for her.

38:56.734 --> 38:58.734
>> KHLOE: Mom's already
stressing me out.

38:58.734 --> 39:01.033
>> KOURTNEY: Yeah.
>> KHLOE: When I said, "Hey, I

39:01.033 --> 39:04.166
think I'm having contractions,"
she said, "(bleep)."

39:04.166 --> 39:06.600
And I go, "What?"
>> KOURTNEY: No, she comes in

39:06.600 --> 39:08.600
the room.
She comes in the room and goes,

39:08.600 --> 39:10.700
"I got to go.
I got to go, guys."

39:10.700 --> 39:13.166
(Khloe laughs)
Um...

39:13.166 --> 39:16.600
>> KHLOE: She's just too much,
and then, I love Kim, and I love

39:16.600 --> 39:19.100
all you guys, but, like, Kim...
You know, it's like everyone

39:19.100 --> 39:21.333
wants me to make a decision
right this second, and I just

39:21.333 --> 39:24.100
want to go and give birth, and
focus on that, and, like, try to

39:24.100 --> 39:26.467
enjoy this, and try to enjoy it
with him.

39:26.467 --> 39:28.600
>> PENELOPE: Mom, can we go
through my backpack?

39:28.600 --> 39:31.433
>> KHLOE: As bad as-- like, as
crazy as that sounds, I want to

39:31.433 --> 39:33.700
enjoy this with him.
>> KOURTNEY: Yeah.

39:33.700 --> 39:36.100
>> KHLOE: I don't want any
negativity in the delivery room.

39:36.100 --> 39:38.367
I don't want anyone to talk
about it, make me feel

39:38.367 --> 39:40.533
uncomfortable or him
uncomfortable.

39:40.533 --> 39:42.533
Like, let's just act normal
for...

39:42.533 --> 39:44.533
Give me a minute.
>> KOURTNEY: Yeah. Okay, I'll

39:44.533 --> 39:46.633
keep you posted on what's going
on.

39:46.633 --> 39:48.633
>> KHLOE: Okay, thank you.
>> KOURTNEY: Okay, bye.

39:48.633 --> 39:50.500
>> MJ: Love you, Khlo.

40:01.734 --> 40:09.200
>> KHLOE: So, the date is April
11, and it is 7:03 p.m., and

40:09.200 --> 40:11.467
I've been having contractions
for quite some time, so I'm

40:11.467 --> 40:15.767
waiting.
My family is getting on an

40:15.767 --> 40:19.667
airplane from L.A., and the
doctor, so I just hope everyone

40:19.667 --> 40:23.567
gets here in time.
And we're just excited to meet

40:23.567 --> 40:26.166
you.
Try to hold on a little bit

40:26.166 --> 40:30.133
longer in there.
You've been cooking very well.

40:30.133 --> 40:40.000
I love you, baby.
Big belly.

40:40.000 --> 40:42.233
>> ALEXA: I hope someone can get
in the air soon.

40:42.233 --> 40:44.500
>> PRODUCER: Yeah.
They said five minutes.

40:44.500 --> 40:47.033
I just asked.
>> MALIKA: I'm gonna have no

40:47.033 --> 40:51.133
cuticles by the time I get to
Cleveland, I swear.

40:51.133 --> 40:54.166
>> KOURTNEY: We had to find two
planes at the last second.

40:54.166 --> 40:57.467
My mom's plane lands first with
the doctor.

40:57.467 --> 41:01.667
They're leaving from LAX, and
then, Malika and Kim and I are

41:01.667 --> 41:04.734
taking a jet from Van Nuys.
We just really want to make it

41:04.734 --> 41:07.033
there in time.
>> KHLOE: When are you guys

41:07.033 --> 41:10.567
taking off?
>> MALIKA: Um, we're waiting on

41:10.567 --> 41:12.533
the plane right now.
>> WOMAN: The plane's getting

41:12.533 --> 41:14.567
fuel right now.
They said we should be able to

41:14.567 --> 41:16.667
get on it in five.
>> MALIKA: So, not too much

41:16.667 --> 41:19.133
longer.
>> KHLOE: Okay.

41:19.133 --> 41:21.133
>> MALIKA: I will see you
shortly.

41:21.133 --> 41:23.166
Where's Sav?
>> KHLOE: Downstairs.

41:23.166 --> 41:25.567
>> MALIKA: Okay. I'll call him.
>> KHLOE: Okay.

41:25.567 --> 41:30.467
>> MALIKA: All right. Bye, babe.
Hi.

41:30.467 --> 41:32.600
>> SAVAS: What's up?
>> MALIKA: Let's have a little

41:32.600 --> 41:36.133
chitchat.
It's very easy to think you need

41:36.133 --> 41:38.700
to rush or panic-- you know what
I mean-- because she's gonna be

41:38.700 --> 41:41.033
acting a fool in the passenger
seat...

41:41.033 --> 41:43.600
>> SAVAS: Yeah, yeah.
>> MALIKA: Somewhat ignore that.

41:43.600 --> 41:45.633
Also, you know, she's very
tough.

41:45.633 --> 41:48.066
She's gonna try not to let you
help her do a lot of things.

41:48.066 --> 41:51.700
Don't-don't-don't listen to her,
don't argue with her.

41:51.700 --> 41:54.066
Just take it and move.
Let her focus on her

41:54.066 --> 41:56.300
contractions.
>> SAVAS: All right.

41:56.300 --> 41:59.233
>> MALIKA: All right, thanks.
Bye.

41:59.233 --> 42:03.233
(indistinct chatter)
Hi, Kimmy.

42:03.233 --> 42:06.300
Can you believe it?
>> KIM: I know, I'm so excited.

42:06.300 --> 42:09.066
>> MALIKA: I'm, like, look, we
all know the problem.

42:09.066 --> 42:11.600
Let's just get on the solution.
>> KOURTNEY: Let's just what?

42:11.600 --> 42:13.600
>> MALIKA: I said, we all know
the problem.

42:13.600 --> 42:17.200
Let's just get on the solution.
>> KOURTNEY: I don't think there

42:17.200 --> 42:19.467
is one.
>> MALIKA: Have the damn baby

42:19.467 --> 42:21.533
and let her figure her life out.
>> KOURTNEY: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

42:21.533 --> 42:23.500
>> MALIKA: You know what I mean?
That's all-- to me, that's the

42:23.500 --> 42:25.500
best thing to do at this point.
>> KOURTNEY: Yeah, totally.

42:25.500 --> 42:27.233
>> MALIKA: 'Cause she's gonna
feel...

42:27.233 --> 42:29.600
>> KIM: She just doesn't want us
to, like, start drama in the

42:29.600 --> 42:31.633
hospital, so...
>> MALIKA: Yeah, she said,

42:31.633 --> 42:33.600
specifically, you be nice.
>> KIM: Yeah, so...

42:33.600 --> 42:35.633
>> MALIKA: I said, "Don't worry.
I got Kimmy for you."

42:35.633 --> 42:38.200
>> KIM: Yeah.
I'm gonna look at him and just

42:38.200 --> 42:42.200
be, like...
>> MALIKA: That's what a big

42:42.200 --> 42:44.734
sister's supposed to do.
Okay, not the second one, babe.

42:44.734 --> 42:47.066
Do the look one, but not the...
>> KOURTNEY: I think the look

42:47.066 --> 42:50.233
one's lame.
I think I would only do that.

42:50.233 --> 42:53.467
>> MALIKA: You two are gonna be
a real problem for me.

42:53.467 --> 42:56.734
He's definitely gonna have to
face you guys, but for her,

42:56.734 --> 43:00.767
we're not even...
Like, just... "Hi."

43:00.767 --> 43:03.266
>> KOURTNEY: Mm-hmm.
>> KIM: I don't even think "Hi."

43:03.266 --> 43:05.233
>> MALIKA: Keep it cordial.
>> KIM: I think just like...

43:05.233 --> 43:08.367
>> MALIKA: And you know what?
I actually like that.

43:08.367 --> 43:12.100
'Cause that's decent.
>> KOURTNEY: I know how

43:12.100 --> 43:15.700
important it is for Khloe to
have Tristan there, and I

43:15.700 --> 43:19.767
actually really respect that,
but it's definitely going to be

43:19.767 --> 43:22.266
awkward.
It's gonna be hard to even look

43:22.266 --> 43:25.033
at him or be in the same room
with him.

43:25.033 --> 43:29.266
It's like you are (bleep) with
all of us when you disrespect

43:29.266 --> 43:31.533
one of us.
>> KIM: I think I'm just

43:31.533 --> 43:35.166
gonna look at him and be like,
"To be continued, (bleep).

43:35.166 --> 43:37.000
It's not over."

43:41.767 --> 43:45.133
>> KIM: On the next episode...
>> KHLOE: I really pray that my

43:45.133 --> 43:48.033
sisters get to the hospital in
time.

43:48.033 --> 43:51.400
>> KOURTNEY: How (bleep) insane
to be doing this by yourself?

43:51.400 --> 43:53.700
>> KIM: How far out are we?
>> MAN: 25 minutes.

43:53.700 --> 43:56.166
>> MALIKA: Oh, my God.
>> KOURTNEY: Hurry!

43:56.166 --> 43:59.133
>> KIM: We can't miss this.
(Khloe groans, True cries)

43:59.133 --> 44:01.133
>> KIM: I unfollowed Tristan on
Instagram.

44:01.133 --> 44:03.133
>> KOURTNEY: Yeah.
>> KIM: He said I'm trying to

44:03.133 --> 44:05.033
start stuff and I'm an
instigator.

44:05.033 --> 44:09.033
I'm, like, done, done with him.
Over it.
