-Hey man, you got that twenty
bucks you owe me?

00:07.542 --> 00:10.250
-You see this International
Teacher Prize they're offering?

00:10.291 --> 00:12.417
-If I say yes, will you just
let it go?

00:12.458 --> 00:14.583
-It's the most coveted award in
the world.

00:14.625 --> 00:16.750
This teacher just won a million
dollars.

00:16.792 --> 00:18.917
-A million? Well, that's a lot
of money.

00:18.959 --> 00:21.125
-I think I should apply for
this, that's what I'm sayin'.

00:21.166 --> 00:24.166
-Absolutely...'Cause this is
right up your alley.

00:24.208 --> 00:26.083
All she did was help a remote...
-Yeah.

-Arctic community overcome harsh
conditions and lack of
opportunity. So...

00:30.667 --> 00:33.542
-I coach hockey, I'm in a
rink all day. Freezing cold.

00:33.583 --> 00:36.375
And she gets isolation pay,
I don't get isolation pay.

00:36.417 --> 00:38.834
-It's the same thing.
And she...

00:38.875 --> 00:43.291
Created a life skills program
aimed specifically at teen
girls so they could...

00:43.333 --> 00:45.208
Help reduce the gender gap?

00:45.250 --> 00:48.375
-Okay, that's not even a thing.
-Yeah, that's what all the
women are saying.

00:48.417 --> 00:51.417
-I let girls play sports.
-You know, you're both heroes.

00:51.458 --> 00:54.583
-If I win...When I win,
I can quit teaching.

00:56.583 --> 00:59.250
-Your heart's in the right
place, Gerry.

00:59.291 --> 01:03.792
Oh...If you get out of this
racket, how are you going
to win this prize next year.

01:03.834 --> 01:06.417
-I never thought of that.
Won't quit.

01:06.458 --> 01:08.917
It will be good to have an
extra million on my salary.

01:08.959 --> 01:12.250
I should get an extra million.
-Then you can give me the
twenty bucks you owe me.

01:12.291 --> 01:15.041
-Look at this. First of
all she's a liar.

01:15.083 --> 01:18.291
'Cause she starts off saying,
"I have always loved working
with kids."

01:18.333 --> 01:21.625
No you haven't. Maybe the
people giving you this
award aren't teachers,

Why don't we split the
difference and we will co-coach.

-Tanya, Tawnya, who cares?

the ball to Tanya.

know if this is enough.

-Yes, okay? Have I ever
steered you wrong?

05:11.083 --> 05:13.792

steered me anywhere it was
very, very wrong.

there!

and go score!

out right now.

love when he sees this, and we
can't win with one player.

can I do for you?

is a tad shy on his GPA.

-Oh, that is a shame.

05:52.291 --> 05:55.250
-Now, I've already tried talking
to some of his teachers about
giving him that...

Itty bitty little boost,
but on one's budging.

05:57.250 --> 06:00.166

real sticklers for those grades.

to you...

that maybe you could give us
that little boost?

attention that one of the
senior students...

07:26.208 --> 07:28.458
That you all teach, is in
the process of transitioning.

sensitive matter with you all.

"Transitioning" is the process
of changing your gender
identity.

It's a big deal.
-I know what transitioning
is, Trudy.

07:43.041 --> 07:45.166
I know it takes a lot of guts.

All I'm saying is, I don't think
we needed a special meeting
for it.

to do right now.

play for the girls soccer team.

-I, um, appreciate the offer.

09:28.458 --> 09:31.208
But, I haven't played since
I was a kid and honestly,
I wasn't the best.

-[Players]: Good game,
good game.

20:21.208 --> 20:23.125
-[Dave]: Olivia didn't help.
-I know, I saw the game, okay?

20:23.166 --> 20:25.291
-And because of your speech
about Olivia, we lost Tanya!

20:25.333 --> 20:28.500
-That's not 'cause of my speech,
Tanya is living her truth.
-[Dave]: Yeah it was!

20:28.542 --> 20:30.500
-[Gerry]: And good for her.
-[Dave]: It was your speech!

20:30.542 --> 20:34.291
-Coach is a loser, coach is
a loser, coach is a loser,
your coach is a loser!

Not you so much.
Wow!

-My best player went to live
her truth, which I support.

20:41.917 --> 20:45.208
And my worst player didn't
tell me the truth.

20:45.250 --> 20:47.125
She was a boy and now...
-Wow.

20:47.166 --> 20:50.542
There's a lot of reasons.
Seriously though you're a loser.

20:50.583 --> 20:54.166
-Yeah, alright.
-You're a LOOOOSER!

20:54.208 --> 20:56.083
Hey, Gerry?
-What?

20:56.125 --> 20:58.542
-My victory dance.

20:58.583 --> 21:01.291
Dance with me, Gerry!

21:01.333 --> 21:04.542
LOOOOOSSSSEEERRR!
