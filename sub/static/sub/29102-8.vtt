WEBVTT

01:34.594 --> 01:35.845
Some history there?

01:40.433 --> 01:42.811
History. Biology.

01:49.484 --> 01:51.194
Eva didn't say
they were gonna send you back.

01:51.277 --> 01:52.779
What are those kids supposed to do now?

01:52.862 --> 01:55.365
I handled it. They're staying with Hopper.

01:55.448 --> 01:57.700
You're such a fucking dumbass.

01:57.784 --> 01:59.369
What the fuck you just call me?

02:05.166 --> 02:06.292
This is stupid.

02:06.376 --> 02:09.504
I thought so. Don't forget,
I'm still your fucking mother.

02:13.800 --> 02:15.593
Where's all the brown

02:15.677 --> 02:18.680
Red isn't feeling so hot, so Litvack said
we could take her back early.

02:18.763 --> 02:22.433
Okay. Don't let her cough on anything.
King just got over his first cold,

02:22.517 --> 02:24.644
and I am not going back
to that circle of hell.

02:24.727 --> 02:27.772
We had to literally suck snot
out of his nose.

02:28.356 --> 02:31.568
It's love, but it is disgusting.

02:31.651 --> 02:32.861
Thanks.

02:38.658 --> 02:41.578
Come on. Give me your hands. Give me.

02:42.203 --> 02:47.000
Come on. All right.
All right, what happened in there?

02:47.083 --> 02:48.501
Why were you in the freezer?

02:49.085 --> 02:53.298
I... I was looking for something.

02:53.381 --> 02:56.759
-No, I wasn't in there that long.

02:56.843 --> 03:00.054
Red, I am worried that there's...

03:01.306 --> 03:03.933
something, uh, something wrong with you.

03:05.393 --> 03:10.106
I'm surprised you even noticed I was gone.
You're so busy conquering Cleopatra.

03:11.024 --> 03:13.026
Yeah, I-- I notice a lot of things.

03:15.445 --> 03:16.779
Can we talk about this?

03:33.463 --> 03:37.675
Sorry. I got stuck listening
to customers complain

03:37.759 --> 03:42.347
about how they can't get
decent stroganina outside of Omsk.

03:43.514 --> 03:45.016
And now I complain to you.

03:45.516 --> 03:46.935
What did I miss?

03:47.685 --> 03:51.022
Mikhail has a line on the Serb importer.

03:51.105 --> 03:52.815
Ilya will go with him.

03:53.691 --> 03:55.860
See what they can coax out of him.

03:57.862 --> 03:59.155
I think it's time to go.

04:01.282 --> 04:02.992
But what about the new business?

04:03.076 --> 04:04.494
We can discuss that another day.

04:04.577 --> 04:05.912
I spoke to Olga again.

04:05.995 --> 04:09.624
She says these retirement communities
are only going to keep popping up.

04:09.707 --> 04:13.544
-If we get in at the beginning--
-Sure, sure. Next time.

04:13.628 --> 04:16.756
And maybe some
of those tea cakes too. For next time.

04:20.718 --> 04:23.805
They can't wait five minute?
I'm offering a gold mine here.

04:24.430 --> 04:26.140
And it's not even illegal.

04:26.224 --> 04:28.017
They'll get excited
when they finally hear it.

04:28.101 --> 04:30.979
Every time they forget
I'm the one with the good ideas.

04:31.562 --> 04:33.648
The prison contract? That was me.

04:34.649 --> 04:38.820
They take my ideas
and then present them as their own.

04:45.285 --> 04:50.039
So, meeting with the Serb?
You ready for that?

04:55.545 --> 04:58.006
Do you think it's too late
to marry Sonya Chekova?

04:58.631 --> 05:01.676
My mother thinks her dad could get me
into courses at the Gem Society. You don't wanna be
a diamond cutter at Zales.

05:05.471 --> 05:09.183
And you don't want to live
next door to your mother.

05:09.267 --> 05:13.021
That's the only reason
Luda is nice to that stupid girl.

05:13.521 --> 05:17.150
You can do better than Sonya Chekova,
with her underbite.

05:19.610 --> 05:22.864
Last time we went out,
the guy didn't die all the way.

05:24.032 --> 05:28.161
-Vlad had to finish him with a tire iron.
-I don't wanna know about these things.

05:29.412 --> 05:32.123
His eye popped out of his head
like a slinky toy.

05:33.207 --> 05:35.460
Maybe they have another job you can do?
I could ask.

05:35.543 --> 05:38.713
No, I'm fine. I can handle it.
I don't know why I'm complaining.

05:42.550 --> 05:44.385
Good things come to those who stay late.

05:47.430 --> 05:49.349
Oh. That's me.

05:49.432 --> 05:50.933
Your mother can wait. Have your cookie.

05:51.017 --> 05:52.894
She'll yell at me. It's not worth it.

05:56.564 --> 05:57.398
Good night.

06:05.782 --> 06:10.787
A goddess hunter must always shoulder
the weight of her own weapons.

06:10.870 --> 06:12.789
It's lesson number one of the retreat.

06:13.706 --> 06:16.834
I'm embracing the change of scenery,
if not the concept.

06:16.918 --> 06:19.212
When Kiki bailed from her
non-refundable spot,

06:19.796 --> 06:21.631
I knew it was serendipity.

06:21.714 --> 06:25.718
I thought, "Who in my life would be
first to die in a nuclear apocalypse?"

06:25.802 --> 06:26.803
-Everybody.
-Piper!

06:26.886 --> 06:31.015
Because you've lost your inner compass,
and your knife skills are atrocious.

06:32.433 --> 06:35.436
I'm not quite sure
how those two things relate to each other,

06:36.562 --> 06:39.190
but it's nice for the opportunity
to shift my focus.

06:39.482 --> 06:41.484
The last few days have been
less than satisfying.

06:41.567 --> 06:44.237
I cannot do sex with strangers.

06:44.862 --> 06:46.906
Well, maybe not stranger strangers.

06:46.989 --> 06:51.869
Would you consider a friend of a friend?
That's less stranger strange.

06:52.120 --> 06:55.915
I thought that we were here
to reclaim our power

06:55.998 --> 06:58.292
as huntresses and sustenance providers.

06:58.376 --> 07:03.464
Yes, but we must also be open to
whatever bounty the Earth Mother provides,

07:03.548 --> 07:04.882
be it prey or partner.

07:16.310 --> 07:18.354
Piper, you remember Maia, right?
From the baby group?

07:18.438 --> 07:20.481
Of course. It's so nice to see you.

07:20.565 --> 07:23.860
Don't worry, I won't say a word
about the whole felon thing.

07:24.444 --> 07:25.695
I appreciate that.

07:25.778 --> 07:29.532
Oh! This weekend is gonna be so primal!

07:29.615 --> 07:34.495
Okay, I would like for everyone
to just take a minute and close her eyes.

07:37.165 --> 07:40.918
Listen to the birds, the wind.

07:41.210 --> 07:44.422
The voice of nature whirring all around.

07:46.507 --> 07:52.138
Listen to where the spirit guides
are telling you

07:52.221 --> 07:57.643
to rest your bodies
and claim the best bedroom for yourself.

07:58.561 --> 08:03.357
Sucker! Mama gets the queen bed!

08:04.317 --> 08:09.572
I am star

08:26.756 --> 08:28.216
You a top or a bottom?

08:29.133 --> 08:31.511
I'm an "anywhere I lay my head is home."

08:31.594 --> 08:34.805
-Hey, Zelda. Hi.
-Hello.

08:34.889 --> 08:39.352
You are gonna love Piper.
-She's super used to bunk beds.

08:46.150 --> 08:48.653
-We said six o'clock.
-I know. Count got fucked up.

08:48.736 --> 08:50.279
They had to redo it three times.

08:50.947 --> 08:54.283
That's good. I thought maybe
you weren't coming because of...

08:55.785 --> 08:56.994
I got it. I got it.

08:59.956 --> 09:04.794
I'm sorry, you know,
about, um, kissing you.

09:05.461 --> 09:10.007
I don't know why, I just, um...
That was stupid, right?

09:10.091 --> 09:12.134
Yes, it was inappropriate.

09:13.094 --> 09:16.013
I just... I thought we were both feeling
some feelings--

09:16.097 --> 09:17.265
-I wasn't.
-Hmm.

09:17.765 --> 09:18.766
I'm married.

09:20.560 --> 09:24.230
I'm not trying to force an inmate
to have sexual relations with me.

09:24.313 --> 09:27.692
You are forcing me to sell contraband,
so it seems like a slippery slope.

09:28.276 --> 09:29.610
You asked me for help.

09:29.694 --> 09:32.822
To get out from under fucking Hellman.
Not to become your mule.

09:32.905 --> 09:36.284
I saved you from a rapey asshole.
I got you a job and money.

09:36.367 --> 09:39.787
Great job. If I get caught,
I get additional time on my sentence.

09:39.870 --> 09:42.123
Phone chargers, they were your idea.

09:42.623 --> 09:44.500
Because it's better than heroin.

09:47.628 --> 09:49.422
So, I guess I'm the asshole, then.

09:51.716 --> 09:52.800
Am I dismissed?

09:53.884 --> 09:55.094
Don't be late again.

10:00.808 --> 10:02.226
Wait, I can't...

10:03.686 --> 10:07.607
I finally get invited to the
Corrections Summit in the Cayman Islands,

10:07.690 --> 10:10.401
only to have to fly home early
to mop up a shit mess.

10:11.861 --> 10:14.196
I had to leave
before Michael Bolton performed.

10:14.989 --> 10:17.199
I did my best with the little time
you gave me

10:17.283 --> 10:19.577
and that newscaster
hell-bent on trying to trap me--

10:19.660 --> 10:21.829
All you had to do
was stick to the talking points.

10:21.912 --> 10:24.373
That is why I printed out talking points.

10:24.457 --> 10:27.835
Nowhere in them did it say
we were reallocating Psych funds

10:27.918 --> 10:29.170
for fucking chickens.

10:30.212 --> 10:31.380
I had to give her something.

10:31.464 --> 10:33.382
Then you should have given me
a heads-up before it aired.

10:33.466 --> 10:36.135
Instead, I had to sit there
and watch you wing it

10:36.218 --> 10:37.928
in a room full of my all-male colleagues.

10:38.012 --> 10:40.431
And you should have seen the look
on Jack's sunburned face

10:40.514 --> 10:42.558
when he watched you
disappear his profit margins

10:42.642 --> 10:45.478
like a low-rent Ricky Jay.
May he rest in peace.

10:49.190 --> 10:50.107
Okay...

10:52.943 --> 10:54.820
Look, I know that this is a hard job.

10:57.865 --> 10:59.575
But I want you to know
that I fought for you.

10:59.659 --> 11:01.452
No one else wanted you here.

11:01.535 --> 11:03.079
I knew you were an out-of-the-box pick,

11:03.162 --> 11:04.997
but I thought I saw
something special in you.

11:05.081 --> 11:08.084
So believe me when I say
that this is coming from a good place.

11:09.043 --> 11:11.545
You are royally fucking up
this golden opportunity.

11:14.173 --> 11:19.470
If I hear about you spending money
on programs, we will shut them down.

11:19.553 --> 11:21.681
So, no, you cannot have
a Special Ed GED tutor

11:21.764 --> 11:23.683
or a grain silo for chicken feed.

11:25.393 --> 11:28.187
Don't do anything more than
what is being asked of you, okay?

11:31.482 --> 11:32.441
Okay.

11:47.206 --> 11:51.043
You want some coffee Ovaltine?

11:51.127 --> 11:55.506
No. Uh, I did not hear you come in. Um...

11:56.424 --> 11:58.592
Any news from your lawyer?

11:58.676 --> 12:00.177
I sent off the book to her.

12:00.261 --> 12:02.555
She says her team will have a look, so...

12:07.810 --> 12:08.936
You all right?

12:10.563 --> 12:11.439
Um...

12:12.189 --> 12:16.652
Do you think I'm fucking it up?

12:20.239 --> 12:21.323
From where I sit,

12:22.700 --> 12:24.493
no, you're not.

12:24.577 --> 12:28.998
In fact, you're the first warden
to even try to make this place better.

12:29.081 --> 12:33.627
There's no money. How can I keep
doing good if the programs are shut down?

12:33.711 --> 12:36.630
Get some volunteers. They don't cost you
nothing but some thank-yous.

12:37.047 --> 12:38.591
Check it, all right?

12:38.674 --> 12:41.093
-Yeah.

12:41.177 --> 12:44.472
Why don't you get them
white

12:44.555 --> 12:48.100
They're all in minimum.
That's a crime that pays for good lawyers.

12:48.184 --> 12:50.102
What about you, Taystee?

12:50.186 --> 12:52.521
I got a job. It keeps me very busy--

12:52.605 --> 12:56.192
But this isn't a job.
It's volunteering, remember?

12:56.275 --> 12:57.109
I don't have time--

12:57.193 --> 13:00.154
Okay, I can fire you,
and-- and you'll have plenty of time.

13:01.572 --> 13:05.284
Okay. I'll find time. I will find time.

13:05.367 --> 13:07.495
-Thank you.

13:10.080 --> 13:11.707
-Question.

13:11.791 --> 13:13.083
Who is Ricky Jay?

13:13.417 --> 13:14.710
Who is Michael Bolton?

13:16.003 --> 13:18.964
-Good day to you, Miss Cluckadoo!

13:19.882 --> 13:22.593
Might I examine your nesting box?

13:26.806 --> 13:28.516
An egg is a tiny miracle, isn't it?

13:28.599 --> 13:32.394
It's life and life's sustenance
all at once.

13:32.478 --> 13:34.480
Okay, why are you so happy?

13:34.980 --> 13:38.359
Did you get some new meds?
'Cause I want some of those.

13:38.442 --> 13:40.861
Unless they make you speedy,
'cause I'm just speedy enough as it is.

13:40.945 --> 13:43.656
No, what you are seeing
is the joy a person feels

13:43.739 --> 13:48.202
when they single-handedly,
through the power of their own words,

13:48.285 --> 13:50.830
can turn the course
of another person's life.

13:52.748 --> 13:55.876
-Oh!
-Look. Look.

13:57.962 --> 14:00.381
"Dear Suzanne, thank you for being a..."

14:00.464 --> 14:04.426
"A bull-headed, refuse-to-listen-
to-reason pain in the ass."

14:04.510 --> 14:07.471
"I think this book
might actually help,

14:07.555 --> 14:10.057
so I'm sending it to my lawyer"?

14:12.059 --> 14:14.019
"I'm sorry I doubted you
in the first place."

14:14.103 --> 14:16.021
"Your friend..."

14:16.730 --> 14:17.690
Huh?

14:18.524 --> 14:20.025
-"Taystee."
-Wow.

14:22.278 --> 14:24.363
-That's really cool.

14:25.030 --> 14:26.615
Yeah, it turns out I'm a fixer.

14:26.907 --> 14:29.994
Like Olivia Pope
or Woodward and <i>Berenstain Bear.</i>

14:30.870 --> 14:33.789
Move chicken, chicken. Move.

14:34.957 --> 14:38.210
Hmm. Only three? Yet we have 12 chickens,

14:38.294 --> 14:40.754
so it stands to reason
we should have closer to 12 eggs.

14:41.255 --> 14:43.799
Give or take. Ladies, gather round.

14:43.883 --> 14:46.886
It appears we have
our first chicken crisis.

14:46.969 --> 14:48.012
A foul fowl?

14:48.095 --> 14:49.096
Uh...

14:50.389 --> 14:54.852
I'll allow it. Now, why are our chickens
not producing eggs?

14:54.935 --> 14:56.812
The eggs can get stuck inside the cloaca.

14:56.896 --> 14:58.898
We could reach inside
and grab the eggs out.

14:58.981 --> 15:02.234
Oh! Maybe the chickens
are eating their own eggs!

15:02.318 --> 15:04.528
They're cannibal chickens.
It happens, you know.

15:04.612 --> 15:07.573
It does. But we would see evidence
of their abomination.

15:07.656 --> 15:09.742
I'm not seeing pecked-out shells.

15:09.825 --> 15:11.994
Ms. Warren

15:12.786 --> 15:15.664
-They need sunlight.
Do chickens go through menopause?

15:16.081 --> 15:17.791
'Cause we can make a test
of their hormones--

15:17.875 --> 15:20.961
The coop is too dark,
and the yard, it's covered.

15:21.045 --> 15:23.213
They need those harmful UVs.

15:23.297 --> 15:27.468
-Vitamin D is vital for egg production.
-Mmm-hmm. Yep. The roof has got to go.

15:27.551 --> 15:29.386
That would leave them
vulnerable to predators.

15:29.470 --> 15:32.264
What We're in a prison.

15:33.015 --> 15:35.351
Do you not see that fence
with the barbed wire on top?

15:35.434 --> 15:37.269
-There's nothing coming in.
-Dragons!

15:37.686 --> 15:40.230
No. And before you ask,

15:40.314 --> 15:43.317
they can't escape,
because chickens can't fly.

15:43.400 --> 15:45.569
That's what they want you to think.

15:46.362 --> 15:48.447
All those in favor of opening the yard?

15:50.783 --> 15:54.286
That's not a majority, but since it's
the only practical solution offered...

15:55.287 --> 15:56.246
See?

15:56.872 --> 15:58.165
Okay, okay, okay.

15:58.248 --> 16:00.584
-I am a fixer. A fixer.
-You're a fixer.

16:10.719 --> 16:11.971
You gonna hug me or what?

16:14.431 --> 16:18.227
I'm still trying to figure out
if I should hug you or smack you.

16:18.477 --> 16:20.396
Yeah, well, probably both, but...

16:22.106 --> 16:24.358
Oh, man.

16:28.904 --> 16:30.447
Hey, do I even want to know?

16:30.531 --> 16:32.658
I mean, I fucked up.
That's not what they got me on.

16:32.741 --> 16:35.327
No.
Just be happy your daughters are grown.

16:36.662 --> 16:38.163
Well, grown can fuck up, too.

16:40.833 --> 16:41.709
Daya needs you.

16:42.084 --> 16:46.380
A ton of drugs in this place,
and she's deep in. I couldn't stop her.

16:46.463 --> 16:49.925
-Yeah, I'mma see about that.
-ICE kitchen crew, line up!

16:50.551 --> 16:51.885
Well, that's me.

16:52.386 --> 16:53.429
Bye, girl. Scoot over.

17:30.799 --> 17:32.301
Ain't you gonna introduce me?

17:35.345 --> 17:37.806
This is Aleida. Aleida, this is the crew.

17:37.890 --> 17:40.225
Oh. You got a crew now?

17:40.726 --> 17:42.728
I remember the last time you had a crew.

17:43.062 --> 17:46.231
Did she ever tell you about the time
she started a gang

17:46.857 --> 17:49.193
Oh, yeah. The Rarities.

17:49.276 --> 17:52.780
Because she was real into those pretty
ponies with the tattoos on their butts

17:52.863 --> 17:54.907
and that was the name
of her favorite one, Rarity.

17:54.990 --> 17:58.160
Except it wasn't that rare,
'cause you get them at, like, Kmart.

17:58.243 --> 17:59.578
Starlight Glimmer was my jam.

17:59.661 --> 18:02.664
But then she begged me
to take her riding in the park,

18:02.748 --> 18:05.167
and then what do you think happens
when I do?

18:05.250 --> 18:07.961
Allergic. She blows up
like a brown Michelin Man.

18:08.837 --> 18:13.092
Yo, check it. You have to picture it.
Like, her eye was bulging out of her--

18:13.175 --> 18:14.843
Yo. Can I talk to you for a second?

18:14.927 --> 18:16.637
What, I can't horse around?

18:18.347 --> 18:21.475
-Puns are the lowest form of humor.
-You can't talk to me like this.

18:21.934 --> 18:24.520
Like what?
Like you're my little grown baby?

18:25.312 --> 18:26.647
I run this block.

18:27.272 --> 18:30.192
Nothing happens here unless I say,
so you need to show some respect.

18:30.818 --> 18:35.072
Relax, sweetie. You don't got to act tough
anymore, 'cause I'm back.

18:35.155 --> 18:37.825
Go, like, take a nap
or whatever it was you were doing.

18:38.117 --> 18:42.996
-Go doodle a picture or whatever.
-No. No, you need to fall in line.

18:43.080 --> 18:44.373
Like everybody else.

18:45.791 --> 18:46.875
Are you about to cry?

18:47.835 --> 18:51.004
Or are your eyes so fucking red
because you're a fucking junkie?

18:51.463 --> 18:55.509
Hmm? 'Cause I can't have no fucking junkie
pushing product.

18:56.969 --> 18:58.637
It's bad for profit margin.

19:03.433 --> 19:05.811
So, who moves what around here?

19:05.894 --> 19:07.396
Diaz is point on that.

19:07.479 --> 19:10.649
Honey, you're not processing.
Daya works for me.

19:10.732 --> 19:12.943
You're all in this because of me.

19:13.026 --> 19:15.988
So, in terms of a business structure...

19:20.993 --> 19:23.162
I'm here, on top.

19:38.385 --> 19:40.095
I don't know what you're talking about.

19:42.723 --> 19:44.975
I believe you called her
your "jalapeño popper"?

19:46.310 --> 19:47.144
It's over.

19:47.227 --> 19:49.104
You left early to hit up that sale
at Kay Jewelers.

19:49.188 --> 19:50.564
What, are you tracking me?

19:50.647 --> 19:54.026
We both know that relationships between
COs and inmates is off-limits.

19:54.109 --> 19:56.445
-They're illegal.
-Also, it's a prosecutable offense,

19:56.528 --> 19:59.364
so, yeah, no, there is nothing going on
between me and Aleida.

19:59.907 --> 20:01.491
Inmate Diaz, the--

20:03.243 --> 20:06.371
Oh, relax. "Judge not, lest ye be judged."

20:06.455 --> 20:08.123
-Jesus.

20:08.207 --> 20:10.209
Tony Robbins. I heard it at a seminar.

20:10.834 --> 20:14.296
In fact, there's another one coming up
in Wilmington next month.

20:14.379 --> 20:16.965
But I'd need a few days off.

20:20.093 --> 20:21.803
Do you think that'll be a problem?

20:25.807 --> 20:28.810
No. No, no problem at all.

20:29.811 --> 20:31.230
To be a true goddess hunter

20:31.313 --> 20:34.191
means to not only master
the art of tracking, procuring,

20:34.274 --> 20:37.486
and preparing your own sustenance,
but to do so with a gratitude

20:37.569 --> 20:40.989
and an understanding of our role
in the universe's vast circle.

20:41.490 --> 20:42.950
Take a moment to examine the bow.

20:43.200 --> 20:47.287
Recognize its power both as an arbiter
of death and a provider of life.

20:47.537 --> 20:50.999
Recognize this multitude
that exists within each of you.

20:51.083 --> 20:54.002
Be proud of it. Be wary of it.

20:54.336 --> 20:56.463
One by one,
I'd like each of you to come forward,

20:56.546 --> 21:00.342
take aim at that target, release something
that's been holding you back.

21:00.717 --> 21:05.264
It is vital that we set our intentions
and clear our minds

21:05.347 --> 21:10.352
of anything that could keep us
from a clean and honorable hunt.

21:15.357 --> 21:19.194
I'm releasing the guilt for not protecting
my mother from my abusive father.

21:28.120 --> 21:30.122
Do we have to say our thing out loud?

21:30.706 --> 21:31.707
Only if you choose.

21:31.790 --> 21:33.542
I feel like if you don't say it out loud,

21:33.625 --> 21:36.753
it's another form of keeping it
locked inside.

21:39.840 --> 21:42.092
Sometimes I breastfeed stoned.

21:45.220 --> 21:47.931
I faked orgasms for the past year.

21:48.432 --> 21:51.393
I don't feel like a mom.
Just me with a baby.

21:54.479 --> 21:57.607
I've had sex with Charlie Rose
and Matt Lauer.

22:00.485 --> 22:01.820
It was consensual.

22:03.780 --> 22:06.241
You're allowed to hold a weapon, right?
That...

22:22.424 --> 22:23.800
I should go again, right?

22:23.884 --> 22:26.303
Actually, that should tell you
all you need to know.

22:31.433 --> 22:32.726
Now, everybody, let's pair up

22:32.809 --> 22:35.062
and head into the forest
for our first hunt!

22:36.480 --> 22:38.899
Only those who have obtained
their hunting licenses

22:38.982 --> 22:40.484
and passed Hunter Safety will hunt.

22:40.567 --> 22:43.945
The rest of you should find a spot
in nature and observe your surroundings.

22:44.196 --> 22:47.032
Practice being so still
that if a deer were to walk by,

22:47.115 --> 22:49.284
they would have no idea
that you were there.

22:50.035 --> 22:51.661
Why don't you go off with Zelda?

22:52.245 --> 22:54.581
She seems cool, right?
Go be still together.

22:54.664 --> 22:55.874
What are you doing?

22:55.957 --> 22:58.585
I thought this was supposed to be
a peaceful escape.

22:58.668 --> 23:00.128
You know what's peaceful?

23:00.212 --> 23:05.133
Staring out at the dawn
while lying in the arms of your lover.

23:05.884 --> 23:06.968
Post-69.

23:08.720 --> 23:10.806
That's not practicing stillness.

23:14.059 --> 23:16.186
Guess that leaves us paired up again.

23:17.312 --> 23:18.480
Guys, hurry up.

23:20.565 --> 23:24.194
I figured out what I'm gonna do
with that deporter douche's sunglasses.

23:24.277 --> 23:27.364
We're gonna call it
Operation Abominable Snowman.

23:28.407 --> 23:30.784
-You know, 'cause he's an ICE monster.

23:30.867 --> 23:32.327
-What we're gonna do first--
-No.

23:32.411 --> 23:34.579
-We're gonna boil it.
-Stop. I mean it.

23:34.663 --> 23:37.290
I'm not gonna do some dumb prank,
messing with an ICE agent.

23:37.374 --> 23:38.625
I'm getting out of here soon,

23:38.708 --> 23:40.877
and I'm not coming back
like dumbass Aleida.

23:41.336 --> 23:42.462
Maybe she slept in?

23:42.546 --> 23:45.340
Right, maybe she's enjoying
the continental breakfast.

23:47.300 --> 23:49.719
Jesus, Red, you had me thinking
all kinds of bad thoughts.

23:49.803 --> 23:52.097
And not the good bad thoughts.
Did you sleep okay?

23:52.180 --> 23:55.225
I'm fine.
You're making a big deal out of nothing.

23:56.101 --> 23:57.519
Yeah, but yesterday--

23:57.602 --> 23:58.979
I'm good as new.

24:02.649 --> 24:04.234
I need you to mail this for me.

24:09.823 --> 24:12.451
-There's no address on it.
I know that.

24:12.534 --> 24:17.164
That's why I'm giving it to you.
You have a cell phone. Find the address.

24:17.247 --> 24:18.123
Uh...

24:19.708 --> 24:21.084
Is this a friend of yours?

24:21.460 --> 24:22.794
That's none of your business.

24:22.878 --> 24:24.838
Hey, I'm just trying
to make some polite small talk

24:24.921 --> 24:26.756
before possibly sending an anthrax note.

24:26.840 --> 24:29.759
If you keep asking pointless questions,
I'll ask someone else.

24:30.218 --> 24:31.553
Give me a second to adjust here.

24:31.636 --> 24:33.763
You scared the living shit
out of me yesterday.

24:33.847 --> 24:35.640
Okay, yesterday, yes...

24:37.350 --> 24:42.022
I got confused. I was tired.
But I'm fine now. Really.

24:43.982 --> 24:46.276
Sending this letter will help me.

24:47.486 --> 24:49.779
Do I need to ask someone else?

24:52.240 --> 24:55.452
No, no, I, uh, I can do it. I got you.

24:57.204 --> 24:58.997
That's my good girl.

25:05.170 --> 25:08.215
Ilya will drive up
as soon as Mikhail signals.

25:09.090 --> 25:12.052
Maybe we shouldn't send Mikhail
with the rookie.

25:12.594 --> 25:14.304
He is our connection to the Serbs.

25:15.013 --> 25:18.225
This time you really got on my nerves.
Enough is enough.

25:18.308 --> 25:19.976
Are you ever
going to let me speak?

25:21.394 --> 25:24.022
My dear, it's not your place
to teach me how to conduct business.

25:24.105 --> 25:30.487
Then why am I sitting at this table,
if you don't need my opinion?

25:30.570 --> 25:33.490
I might as well wait
in the freezer while the men talk,

25:33.573 --> 25:36.743
if you don't want me to speak up
when I notice mistakes.

25:47.629 --> 25:50.924
I'm listening. Enlighten me.

25:52.842 --> 25:54.761
We shouldn't take Ilya tomorrow.

25:54.844 --> 25:58.557
He is very nice, but he is still a boy.

25:58.640 --> 26:00.767
You think I should cut him loose?

26:00.850 --> 26:02.477
No, he knows too much.

26:02.561 --> 26:04.104
Keep him on lookout.
Have him run errands.

26:04.187 --> 26:05.605
It's late to make a change.

26:05.689 --> 26:09.109
Yes, but last-minute changes
are better than failure.

26:09.192 --> 26:11.570
Get Danila or Konstantin.

26:11.653 --> 26:15.282
They're eager to prove themselves
and aren't such mama's boys.

26:15.991 --> 26:17.909
Ilya is not a mama's boy.

26:19.578 --> 26:22.372
I'm a mama.
I know mama's boys.

26:29.170 --> 26:31.423
I found Diablo.

26:31.506 --> 26:32.632
Where is he?

26:32.716 --> 26:35.385
He's in a detention center in Georgia.

26:35.468 --> 26:36.761
Oh, my God.

26:39.973 --> 26:41.850
Okay, well,
at least he's still in the country.

26:42.267 --> 26:45.103
Listen. I got his alien number,
but it wasn't easy.

26:45.186 --> 26:48.898
They had him down as Daria
in the database instead of Dario.

26:48.982 --> 26:52.360
From behind, I see how you make
that mistake. He is a man with hips.

26:53.570 --> 26:56.239
I wish I knew more.

26:56.573 --> 27:00.368
No. At least I can write him now.
Thank you.

27:14.007 --> 27:15.634
Freezer round two?

27:15.717 --> 27:20.805
Is there anywhere else?
The place is kinda haunted for me now.

27:21.264 --> 27:25.143
I mean, I rarely say this,
but, yeah, I'm not in the mood.

27:25.226 --> 27:27.562
What is that

27:27.937 --> 27:30.023
No, Red asked me to send this for her.

27:30.732 --> 27:34.653
Mmm. And you don't know if you should
send it without reading it first.

27:34.736 --> 27:39.866
Um, no, as a rule, I don't really,
you know, read people's sealed letters.

27:41.368 --> 27:43.662
Sure, but, uh...

27:45.455 --> 27:46.289
What?

27:47.791 --> 27:49.501
When my grandmother first got sick,

27:50.460 --> 27:53.254
she made these horrible
late-night phone calls.

27:53.338 --> 27:55.340
Told her brother he was illegitimate.

27:55.840 --> 27:59.094
She lost all sense of what she should
and should not say.

28:01.137 --> 28:03.765
We realized she was starting to lose it.

28:03.848 --> 28:05.809
Red isn't losing it, all right?

28:05.892 --> 28:07.394
I talked to her this morning.

28:07.477 --> 28:11.439
She said she got a little bit confused,
and she feels fine now.

28:11.523 --> 28:15.610
In my experience,
this can get very bad, very quickly.

28:15.694 --> 28:17.779
Some days, my grandmother was fine.

28:17.862 --> 28:20.323
And others, she didn't know my face.

28:22.409 --> 28:26.287
You don't know Red. Loyalty is everything.
You do as you're told.

28:26.371 --> 28:29.374
So I'm gonna send this letter
because she told me to.

28:29.666 --> 28:30.750
I understand.

28:31.918 --> 28:34.045
You love her. You don't want to see it.

28:34.129 --> 28:35.964
And I only see it because...

28:37.006 --> 28:38.425
I care for you.

28:40.844 --> 28:42.804
We all have blind spots.

28:46.224 --> 28:49.561
Put it on a scale. Like, uh, one to ten,

28:50.562 --> 28:51.980
how into me are you?

28:53.398 --> 28:54.774
Eleven.

28:56.943 --> 28:58.945
Well, I'm gonna be googling that.

29:04.826 --> 29:06.035
What are you doing here?

29:07.078 --> 29:08.955
Surprise! I'm your tutor.

29:10.373 --> 29:11.332
What?

29:11.916 --> 29:15.754
Mr. Fantauzzo told me
he was gonna send someone more qualified.

29:15.837 --> 29:19.007
I graduated high school.
That equals qualified.

29:21.217 --> 29:23.595
Okay, so, when is the real tutor
supposed to show up?

29:23.678 --> 29:26.347
Look, I'm here, okay?

29:26.431 --> 29:28.683
And ain't nobody else
coming through that door.

29:28.767 --> 29:30.852
So, do you want help or not?

29:33.438 --> 29:38.610
Okay. So, for the first one here,
you're going to read this paragraph

29:38.693 --> 29:41.863
and you're going to pick
which sentence does not fit.

29:43.615 --> 29:45.200
I read it? Okay.

29:45.617 --> 29:50.330
"Thought Thomas Jefferson's toast
for expensive home furnishings

29:50.413 --> 29:52.916
and wine contra...

29:53.708 --> 29:56.336
contrabanded towd...

29:57.295 --> 30:00.548
Toe whered... Toward! Toward!"

30:01.216 --> 30:02.383
What?

30:02.467 --> 30:03.885
-You fakin'.

30:03.968 --> 30:08.139
I have seen you give
entire 20-minute sermons

30:08.223 --> 30:09.974
about how thongs turn you gay.

30:10.058 --> 30:11.601
I-- I mean, I've seen you recite,

30:11.684 --> 30:15.563
like, whole passages of the Bible
word-for-word, so...

30:16.147 --> 30:19.067
Well, that's because God
was channeling through me.

30:19.359 --> 30:20.193
Okay.

30:20.276 --> 30:23.112
And the things I memorized
from Anita Bryant.

30:24.072 --> 30:27.659
Pretending to be dumb might've worked
for some of your teachers,

30:27.742 --> 30:29.077
but I know you have a brain.

30:29.160 --> 30:31.996
If you wanna pass, you gotta try.

30:32.080 --> 30:35.375
Oh, I got a brain.
It's just wired a little different.

30:35.667 --> 30:37.961
That's why I asked for a special tutor. I mean, I can understand
everything you're saying.

30:41.172 --> 30:42.799
It's just that when
I look at this page here,

30:42.882 --> 30:45.927
it's, like, really fuzzy
and it-- it zooms in and out.

30:46.010 --> 30:50.181
And Mr. Fantauzzo said
that I have a mutant in my tempura lobe.

30:52.475 --> 30:53.309
Hmm.

30:53.977 --> 30:57.981
I didn't know that. Okay. Um...

30:58.898 --> 31:02.151
So, should we start with the alphabet--

31:02.235 --> 31:03.236
No!

31:04.070 --> 31:06.739
See? No! I can fucking read, stupid!

31:07.115 --> 31:09.367
I'm just trying to see where you are.
That is it.

31:09.450 --> 31:11.035
Okay, well, I'm not an r-tard.

31:12.203 --> 31:13.079
You see that?

31:13.162 --> 31:15.039
You saw how I didn't use
the whole word, right

31:15.123 --> 31:17.292
'Cause that would be rude,
and I'm not rude.

31:17.375 --> 31:20.169
I actually respect people,
unlike some people I know.

31:52.076 --> 31:53.453
Hey, what the fuck was that, inmate?

31:53.953 --> 31:55.663
You think I didn't see that, Ms. Munoz?

31:58.917 --> 32:00.251
Oh, fuck.

32:00.752 --> 32:03.421
Ah, I'm gonna need medical in C106.

32:03.504 --> 32:06.633
Fucking cigarettes?
Those things will kill you.

32:16.184 --> 32:17.226
So...

32:18.227 --> 32:20.813
have you always wanted
to kill for food and leather?

32:20.897 --> 32:26.945
I wouldn't say that Neri misled me,
but she did emphasize the sister-bonding,

32:27.028 --> 32:30.031
vision-boarding aspect of this
more than the--

32:30.114 --> 32:31.240
-Yes.

32:32.116 --> 32:33.451
Are you here for the murder?

32:33.534 --> 32:36.746
Oh, absolutely. Exclusively.

32:36.829 --> 32:39.207
Not at all because I wanted
to have a weekend

32:39.290 --> 32:41.751
where I didn't have to worry
about running into my ex-wife

32:41.834 --> 32:44.671
and one of her recent conquests
on the F train.

32:44.754 --> 32:48.800
Oh, my God, I just heard it. The F train.

32:48.883 --> 32:52.845
Look, I know that casual sex
is having a moment right now,

32:52.929 --> 32:55.139
but I am not going to have sex with you.

32:58.685 --> 32:59.811
Good to know.

33:00.436 --> 33:01.938
Oh, I'm so sorry.

33:02.271 --> 33:03.356
Oh!

33:03.439 --> 33:07.235
Neri's had a bee in her bonnet about
getting me to expand my sexual horizons,

33:07.318 --> 33:09.404
and she keeps dropping hints
about you and me.

33:09.487 --> 33:12.240
So, I thought you were in on it.

33:12.323 --> 33:14.075
I've met Neri once.

33:14.158 --> 33:16.911
-At Maia's baby shower.

33:16.995 --> 33:21.416
We played a game where we pretended
melted Snickers was poop.

33:21.499 --> 33:26.212
You should know I've had
a very strange year and a half.

33:26.587 --> 33:27.422
Hmm?

33:29.507 --> 33:30.883
You were on the space station?

33:30.967 --> 33:36.055
No, it's more like I was in a cult
and I'm learning how to re-enter society.

33:36.139 --> 33:38.933
Was it a sex cult?
Is that why you're being so weird?

33:39.017 --> 33:41.144
No, I wasn't actually in a cult.

33:46.774 --> 33:49.861
We ask you, O Earth Creator,
for your forgiveness in taking the life of this humble,
yet noble beast.

33:53.114 --> 33:54.782
I saw hooves and heard grunting.

33:54.866 --> 33:57.368
It must have wandered off
from a nearby farm.

34:01.789 --> 34:03.583
What do we do?

34:07.295 --> 34:08.337
Psst.

34:14.844 --> 34:17.889
Hmm. Yeah.

34:19.474 --> 34:20.725
We need to talk business.

34:20.808 --> 34:22.393
That's the last thing I wanna hear about.

34:22.477 --> 34:24.729
Well, my kids need to eat
and this is how I provide.

34:25.063 --> 34:26.147
Do you see this?

34:26.230 --> 34:28.524
The prison medic says
that it's stress-induced.

34:28.608 --> 34:30.568
What do you gotta be
stressed about?

34:31.027 --> 34:32.028
I don't know,

34:32.111 --> 34:35.823
maybe weekly exchanges with your ex,
Cesar, who's a little intimidating.

34:37.241 --> 34:39.160
Raising four kids by myself.

34:39.243 --> 34:41.204
Or the fact that
if someone found out about us,

34:41.287 --> 34:42.622
I go to federal prison.

34:42.705 --> 34:43.873
You are in federal prison.

34:43.956 --> 34:45.291
This isn't a joke.

34:46.250 --> 34:51.214
My heart is breaking without you.
I hate seeing you in here like this.

34:51.506 --> 34:53.007
Yo, you need to relax.

34:53.091 --> 34:56.427
Yeah, no, it's not ideal,
but now that I'm in here,

34:56.969 --> 34:58.429
we can make changes.

34:58.513 --> 35:03.059
We'll streamline the business
so <i>la idiota</i> can detox.

35:03.142 --> 35:05.937
Plus, we can have some more
one-on-one time.

35:06.312 --> 35:07.855
I miss you, too.

35:10.316 --> 35:11.400
You do?

35:11.484 --> 35:13.903
Now that your hands
ain't all over me all the time,

35:13.986 --> 35:17.115
I can't stop fucking thinkin' about them.

35:17.198 --> 35:23.913
Yeah. Yo, remember that time
outside of the Denny's parking lot?

35:27.542 --> 35:31.003
You ate three Moons Over My Hammy
after that, you remember?

35:33.005 --> 35:33.840
Yo.

35:35.174 --> 35:38.302
You know the closets in here.
Any of them big enough for two?

35:41.639 --> 35:46.435
Good. 'Cause we gonna need it.

35:49.939 --> 35:51.065
Love you.

36:12.670 --> 36:14.547
Hey, this-- this woman is a ghost,
you know.

36:14.630 --> 36:16.424
She's not on Instagram.
She's not on Facebook.

36:16.507 --> 36:18.843
You're not gonna find her on social media.
She's old.

36:18.926 --> 36:21.387
You have to look
at the Whitepages or Spokeo.

36:22.847 --> 36:26.601
So, you and this Shani girl,
you seem pretty close, huh?

36:29.270 --> 36:30.688
I gotta tell you, I don't trust her.

36:30.771 --> 36:33.149
If she was willing to break the law
by coming into this country,

36:33.232 --> 36:34.859
what is she willing to do
once she's here for good?

36:34.942 --> 36:37.528
Look around. We all broke the law.

36:37.612 --> 36:38.529
But that is different.

36:38.613 --> 36:41.699
When you're a citizen, it's your right.
She didn't earn that right.

36:42.074 --> 36:45.828
I bet she wants to green-card marry you
like that French guy with the nose.

36:45.912 --> 36:49.081
You know, I really need to get back
to searching for an old Russian lady

36:49.165 --> 36:52.585
with no digital footprint,
so, if you aren't gonna help me...

36:53.085 --> 36:56.380
Hey, hold on. Female, 58. Holy shit.

36:57.340 --> 36:58.591
This has to be her.

37:01.719 --> 37:04.055
-No, don't do that.

37:04.138 --> 37:06.849
Just call the number,
say you're from Publishers Clearing House

37:06.933 --> 37:09.477
and she won the grand prize,
and you want to make sure she's home

37:09.560 --> 37:11.145
when the cameras are there
and the big check arrives,

37:11.229 --> 37:12.647
so you have to confirm the address.

37:12.730 --> 37:15.399
Can she please repeat that back to you?
"Thank you very much."

37:16.359 --> 37:19.278
If only we could just
harness your brain for good.

37:25.743 --> 37:27.411
Did you think it was a baby deer?

37:27.703 --> 37:29.538
'Cause we're not supposed
to kill Bambi, either.

37:29.622 --> 37:32.375
I can't stop thinking about the name tag.

37:32.458 --> 37:35.169
Wasn't the entire point of this weekend
to kill something?

37:35.253 --> 37:37.713
A deer is game. This is a 4-H pet.

37:37.797 --> 37:39.590
Oh, like you've never eaten a lamb chop.

37:39.674 --> 37:42.385
You know, I think everyone's
just trying to process here.

37:42.468 --> 37:45.554
Goddesses,
clearly Neri is upset by her mistake.

37:45.638 --> 37:47.765
It doesn't serve us to judge her
or her actions.

37:47.848 --> 37:50.601
Imposing guilt or shame
won't magically change the past.

37:50.685 --> 37:54.063
The path back to happiness
is through the ownership of any pain

37:54.146 --> 37:57.608
that you've caused
or any trauma that you've endured.

37:58.526 --> 38:00.486
Neri, please repeat after me.

38:01.821 --> 38:03.114
"I killed a sheep."

38:05.283 --> 38:06.826
I killed a sheep.

38:07.660 --> 38:09.912
Continue until you're in control
of your words.

38:13.541 --> 38:14.917
I killed a sheep.

38:16.794 --> 38:18.337
I killed a sheep.

38:21.716 --> 38:23.009
I killed a sheep.

38:27.138 --> 38:30.433
I killed... a sheep.

38:33.686 --> 38:34.770
Yes, you did.

38:35.813 --> 38:38.024
Now, let's talk about the art of butchery!

38:38.107 --> 38:42.320
When the indigenous Americans hunted,
they utilized the entire animal,

38:42.403 --> 38:44.697
from the meat to the hide to the sinews

38:44.780 --> 38:47.450
that connect muscle to bone.
Sinews make wonderful cordage.

38:47.533 --> 38:49.660
I'm 12% Native American.

38:54.123 --> 38:56.459
Freckles will not be wasted.

38:56.542 --> 38:59.628
Her death will have purpose
as we utilize all of her.

38:59.712 --> 39:01.255
As we butcher this animal,

39:01.339 --> 39:05.259
I want you to honor
all the parts of yourselves.

39:05.843 --> 39:09.805
When we deem certain parts of ourselves
as bad and other parts as good,

39:09.889 --> 39:12.975
we are only setting ourselves up
to be unhappy.

39:13.642 --> 39:16.896
So welcome the dark and the light.

39:16.979 --> 39:19.690
It is called radical self-acceptance,

39:19.774 --> 39:23.444
and it means embracing
every part of who you are.

39:39.210 --> 39:42.380
Is that a fetus?

39:44.173 --> 39:45.925
More parts than we expected. Nature has given us a bounty.

39:47.843 --> 39:50.763
We're not gonna have to eat that, are we?

40:03.776 --> 40:05.069
I wanna try again.

40:06.445 --> 40:07.571
You disrespected me.

40:07.655 --> 40:10.074
I know, and I'm sorry, okay?

40:10.157 --> 40:13.702
I'm new to this tutoring thing,
and I'm learning, too.

40:13.786 --> 40:18.207
So, I've been studyin' the right way
to help you.

40:21.252 --> 40:24.422
I was reading this workbook,
and it turns out, it's pretty cool.

40:24.797 --> 40:25.756
-Yeah.

40:25.840 --> 40:29.218
It turns out there's all these
different kind of ways to read.

40:29.301 --> 40:31.554
They even got something
called ear reading,

40:31.637 --> 40:35.474
which, at first, I thought was cheating,
but it turns out, it's actually legit.

40:35.558 --> 40:37.518
Yeah, whatever.
I'm never gonna pass that stupid test.

40:40.729 --> 40:41.730
I got you this.

40:42.148 --> 40:43.315
I don't huff anymore.

40:43.399 --> 40:46.902
The book says it helps
to highlight your words as you read.

40:47.278 --> 40:50.990
That way, you know what you already read
and you don't get lost.

40:53.742 --> 40:56.829
Look, Suzanne didn't give up on me.

40:57.496 --> 41:00.875
And I want to pay that forward
and not give up on you.

41:02.251 --> 41:04.462
You're lucky I got a forgiving spirit.

41:09.967 --> 41:11.510
Yo. Psst.

41:12.845 --> 41:14.346
Your intel checked out.

41:14.430 --> 41:17.308
So, I got what I needed
and now you get what you need.

41:17.766 --> 41:19.768
I got something from my private stash.

41:20.060 --> 41:24.482
I decided to upgrade you,
'cause, you know, I'm generous like that.

41:24.565 --> 41:26.775
So, you take this.

41:26.859 --> 41:30.905
You go down easy, easy.

41:31.697 --> 41:33.449
Not like Daddy did.

41:35.659 --> 41:37.828
Yo, I'll see you later.

41:48.714 --> 41:52.885
That's ten eggs. A 233% improvement rate.

41:53.594 --> 41:57.014
I have to say, this sunlight theory
appears to have legs.

41:57.097 --> 41:58.891
Or should I say "eggs"?

41:59.391 --> 42:01.018
-I'll allow it.

42:01.101 --> 42:02.811
I think you both mean "drumsticks."

42:02.895 --> 42:05.314
Either way, chicken crisis averted,
thanks to you.

42:05.397 --> 42:06.941
Thank you, thank you.
What can I say?

42:07.024 --> 42:10.069
When I look into their chicken faces,
I just understand them.

42:10.152 --> 42:11.946
I think it's because I think of them
as people.

42:12.029 --> 42:14.490
Chickens actually see
substantially better than people.

42:14.573 --> 42:15.866
They have two additional cones.

42:15.950 --> 42:17.618
They can see colors
we can't even dream of.

42:17.701 --> 42:20.037
Since one of the tenets of farm therapy is

42:20.120 --> 42:24.500
that taking responsibility for creatures
other than yourself empowers you,

42:24.583 --> 42:30.130
Ms. Warren, you have earned the position
of Mayor of, uh, New Cluck City.

42:30.214 --> 42:31.549
What?

42:31.882 --> 42:35.594
Oh! I'm gonna need a podium
and two flags flanking me at all times.

42:35.678 --> 42:37.096
New Cluck City

42:37.179 --> 42:38.264
It should have been me.

42:39.181 --> 42:41.475
Thank you.
Thank you for your service.

42:42.184 --> 42:43.227
Thank you.

42:44.186 --> 42:46.188
Oh. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

42:46.272 --> 42:50.526
Everything's-- Everything's changed.
The responsibility...

42:50.609 --> 42:52.861
Look, before, my life was...

42:57.783 --> 43:01.829
And now my life is the mayor.

43:03.455 --> 43:06.041
I promise to bring together
this divided house of chickens.

43:06.125 --> 43:07.793
I promise to fight for you.

43:08.377 --> 43:11.171
And for every citizen in this coop,

43:11.255 --> 43:13.549
-I promise to ensure--
-Wait, wait, wait. Can I please...

43:13.632 --> 43:15.467
May I please be your lieutenant?

43:18.929 --> 43:21.849
Yes, you can.

43:21.932 --> 43:24.143
Really?
Yes, you can!

43:24.226 --> 43:25.144
-Yes, you can!
-Yes, I can! Yes, you can.

43:31.609 --> 43:33.986
Is it true you didn't mean
to shoot that guard in the riot?

43:34.069 --> 43:37.489
-Aleida said it was an accident.

43:38.240 --> 43:40.409
I'm on your side,
but the others are beginning to question.

43:40.701 --> 43:42.036
Aleida wasn't even there.

43:44.580 --> 43:45.998
You gonna sit or you gonna help?

43:49.752 --> 43:52.713
I meant to shoot him.
It was only an accident that he died.

43:52.796 --> 43:54.381
Oh, it was a half-accident.

43:54.965 --> 43:57.259
Aleida said she would have shot him
in the balls and the head.

43:57.343 --> 43:58.802
Femme fatale-style.

43:59.553 --> 44:00.638
Fuck Aleida.

44:00.721 --> 44:03.515
Coming in here
like she deserves a spot at the top,

44:03.599 --> 44:04.475
when I earned it.

44:07.853 --> 44:09.229
-With your help.
-Yeah.

44:09.313 --> 44:10.939
She is beginning to act entitled.

44:11.523 --> 44:14.943
Whatever. She may be charming
in the beginning and all,

44:15.486 --> 44:18.113
but all she's good for is
breakin' promises and fuckin' bald losers.

44:23.827 --> 44:25.412
No, it's a tub.

44:27.206 --> 44:28.582
It's not in this bag.

44:29.958 --> 44:31.669
Is your mother gonna blame us for this?

44:32.503 --> 44:34.213
Oh, that fucking bitch!

44:34.296 --> 44:36.590
She did this. She cut us out.

44:41.970 --> 44:43.555
I heard you can find people.

44:43.639 --> 44:45.516
I need to find my sister.

44:46.934 --> 44:49.645
No, no, no.
That was a one-time deal for a friend.

44:49.728 --> 44:52.147
Please. I have no one else to ask.

44:56.652 --> 44:59.113
-I'll see what I can do.
-Thank you.

45:05.077 --> 45:06.537
God bless you.

45:10.499 --> 45:11.458
Oh.

45:25.806 --> 45:27.474
Ladies, outdoor time is over.

45:27.558 --> 45:30.728
Line up against the far wall
in an orderly fashion.

45:34.148 --> 45:36.483
Against the wall! Now!

45:48.245 --> 45:51.915
Oh, my God. I am so sorry.
I think the handle must have got stuck.

45:52.332 --> 45:53.917
I think it's broken.

45:54.001 --> 45:56.086
-Let's go!

45:58.297 --> 46:01.467
-Step aside, inmate.

46:01.550 --> 46:02.926
Jeez, man, I come in peace.

46:15.981 --> 46:16.982
I found Luda.

46:18.025 --> 46:19.985
Good.

46:20.819 --> 46:24.865
You sent it. Good girl. I couldn't find the address.
I had to, uh, call her.

46:30.245 --> 46:31.580
I talked to her.

46:33.040 --> 46:36.084
So

46:39.713 --> 46:41.340
She wanted me to read her the letter.

46:43.884 --> 46:44.802
And?

46:46.386 --> 46:52.643
And she said that you already sent her
that same letter ten years ago.

46:52.726 --> 46:54.061
The same apology.

46:54.144 --> 46:58.816
She said she didn't forgive you then,
and she isn't ready to forgive you now.

47:02.694 --> 47:04.780
About what happened with her son.

47:05.531 --> 47:06.532
I never...

47:08.408 --> 47:12.329
I never sent her a letter.

47:16.083 --> 47:20.712
See, I-- I think that, you know,
maybe you did.

47:20.796 --> 47:23.632
And, you know, you just forgot.

47:23.715 --> 47:26.176
You know, like you forgot
why you were in the freezer.

47:26.260 --> 47:29.930
I told you, huh?
It was a blip. I'm fine now.

47:30.013 --> 47:33.767
I think we need to go see a doctor.

47:34.351 --> 47:38.313
Oh, you think, do you?
For what?

47:38.397 --> 47:39.857
So they can put me on a leash

47:39.940 --> 47:42.359
and feed me through a tube
for the rest of my life?

47:42.442 --> 47:45.445
They can drag me out of this kitchen
when I die.

47:45.529 --> 47:49.741
I am only saying this
because I love you, Ma.

47:49.825 --> 47:54.580
-You had no right to read that letter.

47:54.663 --> 47:57.875
-I trusted you and you betrayed me.
-No.

47:57.958 --> 48:00.210
You asked me for my help,

48:00.294 --> 48:02.880
-and so that is what I did.
-We're done!

48:07.634 --> 48:11.430
The boys are at Jelina's.
We could go out together.

48:11.513 --> 48:13.432
What about <i>Who Wants To Be A Millionaire?</i> Don't you wanna see
if that college student wins?

48:15.517 --> 48:17.853
What does he need a million dollars for?

48:17.936 --> 48:20.564
They always think they know,
and guess, and poof!

48:20.647 --> 48:21.899
They never walk away.

48:24.610 --> 48:26.778
Not everyone is smart as my Galina.

48:34.036 --> 48:36.246
Well done.
You didn't let us down.

48:36.330 --> 48:38.916
You've proved that you are ready.

48:40.584 --> 48:42.044
No, we've talked about it.

48:42.127 --> 48:44.046
Inspectors come unannounced.

48:44.129 --> 48:47.132
Don't worry, we will come
tomorrow and get everything done.

48:48.216 --> 48:50.510
Galina, thank you very much
for your advice.

48:50.761 --> 48:55.182
Ilya was a real mama's boy.
We couldn't use him.

49:06.234 --> 49:07.319
Gali...

49:38.767 --> 49:42.187
Do we got a dozen birds
present and accounted for, Mayor Warren?

49:42.270 --> 49:43.563
Don't worry. Getting it.

49:43.897 --> 49:45.273
You got two minutes.

49:45.357 --> 49:49.069
Lieutenant, I'm going to shoo the birds
over there and you count off,

49:49.152 --> 49:52.114
-and don't let them come back to my side.
-Okay. Gotcha.

49:52.197 --> 49:56.201
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven,
eight, nine, ten, eleven...

49:58.829 --> 50:02.833
One, two, three, four...
Ten, eleven, twelve...

50:03.792 --> 50:06.294
Uh, mayor,
do you think that when he said,

50:06.378 --> 50:07.546
"There's a dozen chickens,"

50:07.629 --> 50:10.382
that he meant a baker's dozen?
Like, 13 chickens?

50:10.465 --> 50:13.802
No, no, no. You're counting wrong.
You gotta use the voice.

50:14.636 --> 50:18.724
There's one, one chicken!

50:20.058 --> 50:22.728
Two, two chickens!

50:23.353 --> 50:27.315
Three, three noble birds!

50:27.399 --> 50:30.944
Four... Okay, wait.
One, two, three, four...

50:31.028 --> 50:33.572
-I declare a thumb war.
-...five, six, seven, eight, nine...

50:33.655 --> 50:36.825
-Classic tactic of the puppet state.
-Nine, ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen.

50:36.908 --> 50:37.909
Wait, there is a surplus.

50:37.993 --> 50:40.996
Yeah, I knew that "no flying" thing
was just a big fake out.

50:41.580 --> 50:42.998
No, this is a foreign chicken.

50:43.081 --> 50:45.167
Look, all these chickens look the same.

50:45.250 --> 50:47.085
Maybe there was 13 chickens
the whole time.

50:47.169 --> 50:49.796
No, not all brown chickens look the same.

50:49.880 --> 50:52.883
This chicken has white spots
and black tips.

50:52.966 --> 50:54.593
That... Wait.

50:56.887 --> 50:57.888
I've seen...

50:59.431 --> 51:01.099
I've seen this chicken.

51:01.183 --> 51:05.812
Oh! Maybe she tunneled in like El Chapo.
See, that would be the twist right there.

51:05.896 --> 51:10.817
No, no, no. This is a special chicken.
This is a magical chicken.

51:13.361 --> 51:14.821
Okay. I'mma go tell Alvarez.

51:14.905 --> 51:18.283
What? No! I'm the mayor.
This is my jurisdiction.

51:19.326 --> 51:21.244
Now, what would a mayor do?

51:22.454 --> 51:25.248
He'd be mayoral.
I declare that this chicken can stay.

51:26.625 --> 51:28.543
This chicken deserves to be here.

51:29.461 --> 51:32.631
Now, I was right about the sunlight.
I know I'm right about this.

51:32.714 --> 51:34.132
I'm not convinced at all.

51:34.216 --> 51:35.717
You almost done?
-No, we cannot tell him.

51:35.801 --> 51:36.802
-You got 13!
-We're not going to tell him.

51:36.885 --> 51:39.429
'Cause he will blame me
for the magic chicken,

51:39.513 --> 51:43.558
for it magically coming in here,
and he will strip me of my authority.

51:45.227 --> 51:46.144
And you of yours.

51:46.478 --> 51:51.983
I expose conspiracies.
I do not participate in conspiracies.

51:52.067 --> 51:54.736
Do we have a dozen?
Hopper finally invited me to happy hour.

51:54.820 --> 51:56.780
I don't want to be any later
than 15 minutes early.

51:56.863 --> 51:59.366
Yes, we absolutely have...

52:02.119 --> 52:03.578
-a dozen.
Thirteen.

52:06.832 --> 52:11.211
Thirteen is a very, very unlucky number.

52:11.878 --> 52:14.089
You gotta look out for them omens!

53:25.535 --> 53:26.661
You're not Creech.

53:26.745 --> 53:29.831
She's still in medical. I'm supposed
to search the room for contraband.

53:35.378 --> 53:36.338
I, uh...

53:37.214 --> 53:38.256
I'm sorry.

53:39.007 --> 53:40.884
I was so caught up in my own shit,

53:40.967 --> 53:43.345
I didn't realize
how much I was putting you at risk.

53:43.428 --> 53:45.055
Welcome to the life of a drug lord.

53:50.685 --> 53:53.063
You know, it took me four years
to get this job.

53:53.480 --> 53:56.608
Everyone claims
they wanna help soldiers coming home.

53:56.691 --> 53:57.901
"Thank you for your service."

53:57.984 --> 54:00.946
But no one's willing to put up
with the reality that comes with that.

54:01.029 --> 54:04.824
I can't control my temper.
I fucking burn myself.

54:04.908 --> 54:07.661
Since coming home,
I've gone through, like, eight jobs.

54:07.744 --> 54:12.624
I got fired from Dairy Queen
after I snapped and cussed out a kid.

54:12.707 --> 54:17.254
Then Walmart let me go
when I cussed out another kid.

54:18.004 --> 54:19.256
You'll never guess what happened

54:19.339 --> 54:22.634
when I dressed up as Little Mermaid
for a kid's party.

54:23.260 --> 54:26.388
I'm guessing you didn't give up your voice
for a man and live happily ever after.

54:28.682 --> 54:31.268
At first, I took out credit cards
to buy groceries.

54:31.351 --> 54:36.398
Then I used the cash advances to pay rent.
I got underwater, like, immediately.

54:36.773 --> 54:38.566
I can't afford to lose this job.

54:38.650 --> 54:44.406
Otherwise, I would've quit
when y'all took me hostage in that riot.

54:46.032 --> 54:47.742
Yeah, that wasn't our best moment.

54:52.789 --> 54:55.583
I don't want to force you
to do anything.

54:56.835 --> 54:59.045
If you wanna stop, you can stop.

55:00.046 --> 55:01.923
There's a couple of chargers in there

55:02.007 --> 55:06.594
as a "thank you," or "I'm sorry,"
or whatever.

55:17.022 --> 55:19.816
I bet you do look like a mermaid
with your hair down.

55:50.805 --> 55:53.016
How mad do you think
they're all gonna be

55:53.099 --> 55:54.642
when they find out we took this?

55:54.726 --> 55:58.104
We're still using all the parts.
It's tree fertilizer.

55:58.188 --> 56:02.984
Yeah, and it's also
honoring what Freckles would have wanted.

56:03.068 --> 56:05.820
I mean, I don't think
I'm anthropomorphizing to assume

56:05.904 --> 56:10.200
that Freckles would prefer her baby
not be turned into a change purse.

56:15.413 --> 56:17.749
-Or maybe one tiny mitten.
-Eww.

56:23.421 --> 56:25.048
Do we say a few words?

56:34.933 --> 56:37.185
Dear Freckles Junior...

56:39.104 --> 56:41.106
I'm sorry you never got to live.

56:41.689 --> 56:43.358
At least you never had to pay alimony.

56:43.441 --> 56:45.777
Tough breakup, huh?

56:45.860 --> 56:47.487
You know the most pathetic part?

56:47.570 --> 56:49.948
We've been over for seven months.

56:50.031 --> 56:54.702
I may have to revisit
Rio's arrow release exercise.

56:56.913 --> 56:57.914
Me, too.

57:00.625 --> 57:02.419
I need to release prison.

57:05.672 --> 57:08.007
I recently got out of federal prison.

57:08.091 --> 57:10.260
I'm not dangerous or anything, but it--

57:13.096 --> 57:16.724
It's a part of me, and I've been hiding it
and I need to embrace it.

57:23.481 --> 57:27.902
I carried a bag of drug money,
and it was illegal,

57:27.986 --> 57:30.071
and I pled guilty, and I went to prison,

57:30.155 --> 57:34.242
and I met parts of myself
lurking inside of me

57:34.325 --> 57:36.244
that I didn't even know were in there.

57:40.123 --> 57:41.374
And it was like...

57:43.418 --> 57:45.086
4% of my life.

57:50.925 --> 57:56.014
But it was enough
to change absolutely everything.

58:04.689 --> 58:07.400
And I have no idea who I am now.

58:22.040 --> 58:24.083
We should go. I don't know if...

58:25.877 --> 58:29.088
illegal disposal of a sheep fetus
is in violation of my parole.

58:29.506 --> 58:32.842
Or we could just stay here for a while.
