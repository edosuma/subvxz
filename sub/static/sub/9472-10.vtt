01:09.916 --> 01:12.549
"VICE" correspondent
Ben Anderson first reported

01:12.584 --> 01:15.819
on slave labor in the United
Arab Emirates eight years ago.

01:15.854 --> 01:18.155
We're going to see what
conditions are like on this,

01:18.190 --> 01:22.226
which is one of the most high profile
projects in the whole of Dubai.

01:22.261 --> 01:23.928
During a recent investigation,

01:23.963 --> 01:26.763
he discovered some of the worst
conditions he'd ever seen

01:26.799 --> 01:29.232
on a development bearing
the name of a man

01:29.267 --> 01:31.868
who just might be our next president.

01:31.904 --> 01:37.707
♪ ♪

01:37.743 --> 01:40.844
Anderson: <i>The United Arab Emirates,
and Dubai in particular,</i>

01:40.879 --> 01:43.212
<i>are often sold as a paradise
in the Middle East.</i>

01:43.248 --> 01:48.517
<i>Home to the world's largest and most
luxurious malls, hotels and golf courses,</i>

01:48.553 --> 01:52.655
<i>promising unprecedented luxury
for the few who can afford it.</i>

01:52.690 --> 01:55.591
So this is Sheikh Zayed Road,

01:55.626 --> 01:58.428
one of the most famous
landmarks in Dubai.

01:58.463 --> 02:01.230
Billions and billions
of dollars of real estate,

02:01.266 --> 02:05.768
and then literally in the
shadows of that is this slum.

02:05.803 --> 02:09.872
So the hundreds of thousands of
men who actually built Dubai,

02:09.907 --> 02:11.841
this is where they live.

02:11.876 --> 02:15.077
<i>The UAE's record on migrant
worker's rights is well known,</i>

02:15.112 --> 02:17.980
<i>so we started our investigation
by looking at NYU.</i>

02:18.015 --> 02:22.250
<i>When they were enticed into Abu Dhabi,
they established their own labor standards</i>

02:22.286 --> 02:26.788
<i>so that subcontractors building their
campus would treat their workers fairly.</i>

02:26.823 --> 02:30.492
<i>Those standards were tested when one
group of workers went on strike.</i>

02:30.527 --> 02:35.429
<i>They live two hours drive away
from the campus site in Dubai.</i>

02:35.465 --> 02:38.566
So this is one of the many
labor camps in Dubai,

02:38.602 --> 02:42.236
and there are just
dozens of huge buildings

02:42.271 --> 02:47.041
that look like a cross between
warehouses and prisons.

02:47.076 --> 02:51.912
This is the Dubai that most
tourists who come never see.

02:51.947 --> 02:54.581
<i>Striking is strictly illegal
in the UAE,</i>

02:54.617 --> 02:58.052
<i>but these workers eventually felt
like they had no other option.</i>

02:58.087 --> 03:02.023
(speaking foreign language)

03:10.065 --> 03:15.068
So can you describe how the company
reacted when you went on strike?

03:42.797 --> 03:45.798
Anderson: <i>Most workers have to
take out loans to get to the UAE.</i>

03:45.833 --> 03:50.703
<i>Being deported means going home saddled
with debt, and no way of paying it off.</i>

03:50.738 --> 03:53.472
<i>The strike was covered by
"The New York Times,"</i>

03:53.507 --> 03:55.808
<i>a week before a lavish
commencement ceremony</i>

03:55.843 --> 03:58.210
<i>featuring former
President Bill Clinton,</i>

03:58.245 --> 04:00.779
<i>who was forced to address the issue.</i>

04:00.814 --> 04:02.448
When this story came out,

04:02.483 --> 04:07.152
the university and the government
promised to look into the charges,

04:07.188 --> 04:09.721
and if the charges were well founded,

04:09.756 --> 04:13.758
to take appropriate
remedial action promptly.

04:13.794 --> 04:15.226
Anderson: <i>What the
government actually did</i>

04:15.261 --> 04:18.697
<i>was call the journalist who broke
the story in for questioning.</i>

04:18.732 --> 04:21.065
Well, I was told to meet
the spokesperson

04:21.101 --> 04:22.968
for Abu Dhabi police in a bar.

04:23.003 --> 04:25.036
You recorded this meeting?

04:25.072 --> 04:28.272
(man speaking)

04:30.110 --> 04:33.744
Anderson: <i> After letting him know he was
in trouble, they offered a way out.</i>

04:44.924 --> 04:46.424
As you can see here
in the transcript,

04:46.459 --> 04:48.525
the police chief wanted
a monthly report.

04:48.560 --> 04:51.128
Any foreign journalists
who were coming to the UAE,

04:51.163 --> 04:54.297
I was to write a report on why they're
in the UAE, what their agenda was...

04:54.333 --> 04:56.734
You'd be spying on foreign
journalists as well, for them?

04:56.769 --> 04:58.002
Yes. Yeah, yeah. Yes.

04:58.037 --> 05:00.704
What happened? You said to them
you're not accepting the offer?

05:00.740 --> 05:03.706
I said, "Yeah, yeah." I
listened to it and everything,

05:03.742 --> 05:06.042
and then I left the country
pretty soon after that.

05:06.077 --> 05:09.579
And then when I came back, I was arrested
at the airport, and then I was deported.

05:09.615 --> 05:12.282
Anderson: <i>After commissioning
an independent report,</i>

05:12.317 --> 05:14.417
<i>NYU admitted real lapses</i>

05:14.453 --> 05:18.455
<i>and promised to pay
compensation to 10,000 workers.</i>

05:18.490 --> 05:21.758
<i>The UAE is run
by absolute monarchies.</i>

05:21.793 --> 05:25.662
<i>With no freedom of expression and
no right to protest or form unions,</i>

05:25.697 --> 05:27.764
<i>it's routine to exploit the laborers</i>

05:27.799 --> 05:31.100
<i>who are building almost $400 billion
worth of construction projects</i>

05:31.136 --> 05:34.037
<i>currently underway in Dubai alone.</i>

05:34.072 --> 05:37.105
<i>There are roughly five million
migrant workers in the UAE,</i>

05:37.141 --> 05:39.007
<i>making up over half the population.</i>

05:39.043 --> 05:41.477
<i>Some of these workers
let us into their homes,</i>

05:41.512 --> 05:44.079
<i>but to keep them safe, we had
to conceal their identities.</i>

05:44.114 --> 05:48.850
So this is two buildings with a bit
of corrugated iron across the middle.

05:48.886 --> 05:51.654
It looks a bit like a communal
kitchen, washing area.

06:21.751 --> 06:23.518
So when some people leave,
other people come in

06:23.553 --> 06:25.152
and take their place on the floor?

06:43.939 --> 06:45.038
Cancel the visa?

06:46.475 --> 06:49.175
<i>In the next room, we met workers
who had similar stories,</i>

06:49.211 --> 06:51.978
<i>but were working for a subcontractor
building a golf course</i>

06:52.013 --> 06:55.349
<i>bearing the name of one of America's
leading presidential candidates.</i>

06:55.384 --> 06:59.285
There is a big development called
the Trump International Golf Club.

06:59.320 --> 07:01.020
Is that where you worked recently?

07:03.859 --> 07:05.759
Is this the entrance?

07:08.029 --> 07:10.096
When you were at home in Pakistan,

07:10.132 --> 07:13.233
what were you told that made
you want to come to Dubai?

07:27.214 --> 07:28.748
If you could have anything,
all you would want

07:28.783 --> 07:33.118
is to be promised the 10 dirhams per
hour, that's three dollars, roughly,

07:33.154 --> 07:36.021
instead of
the five dirhams, $1.50,

07:36.056 --> 07:38.423
that you are being paid.
That's all you ask for.

07:40.094 --> 07:41.894
Did you have to pay a visa fee?

07:43.730 --> 07:45.998
So, at the money you are
being paid now,

07:46.033 --> 07:49.066
how long will it take you
just to pay off the visa fee?

07:55.742 --> 07:58.610
Anderson: <i>So that's two years'
work, just to break even.</i>

07:58.645 --> 08:03.047
<i>And these men are charged nearly another
year's salary for a visa renewal fee.</i>

08:03.082 --> 08:06.784
<i>Charging the workers these fees
is illegal here in the UAE.</i>

08:06.820 --> 08:09.020
Why don't you just go home?

08:09.055 --> 08:11.122
If you're not actually
making money here?

08:17.596 --> 08:20.064
Anderson: <i>And there's another
illegal but commonly used tactic</i>

08:20.099 --> 08:22.199
<i>for subcontractors to keep
the workers in place.</i>

08:22.234 --> 08:26.370
How many of you, when you arrived, had
your passports taken away by the company?

08:29.342 --> 08:31.675
Anderson: <i>These workers now
find themselves trapped,</i>

08:31.711 --> 08:35.245
<i>and working on a development which
bears both Trump's name and face,</i>

08:35.280 --> 08:39.381
<i>helping to sell the million dollar
plus homes that will soon be complete.</i>

08:39.417 --> 08:42.418
<i>Trump himself came to formally
launch the project.</i>

08:42.453 --> 08:45.488
We're building Trump
International Golf Club,

08:45.523 --> 08:47.657
and it's going to be spectacular.

08:47.692 --> 08:48.892
Right in Dubai,

08:48.927 --> 08:52.963
<i>and it's going to be something
very, very special.</i>

08:52.998 --> 08:54.997
Anderson: <i>I visited the same showroom</i>

08:55.032 --> 08:57.132
<i>to see how it's now being sold.</i>

08:57.168 --> 08:58.968
Anderson:
Good to meet you.

08:59.003 --> 09:00.470
Good, thank you.

09:00.505 --> 09:04.273
And the golf course is another
Trump International Golf Course?

09:04.308 --> 09:08.177
Does he just give his name to the
development or is he involved in...

09:10.948 --> 09:12.348
Right.
So Trump does

09:12.383 --> 09:15.217
the bigger villas, the golf
course, the clubhouse.

09:17.488 --> 09:18.553
Yeah.

09:22.093 --> 09:24.459
In the UK, sometimes
in the newspaper,

09:24.495 --> 09:28.497
you read stories about how the laborers
who come from India, Pakistan,

09:28.532 --> 09:30.164
like they get treated very badly.

09:30.200 --> 09:33.635
So it's important for us
to know, like...

09:33.670 --> 09:36.170
So DAMAC and Trump,
they treat them...

09:36.206 --> 09:37.572
they treat them good?
Yeah?

09:40.277 --> 09:41.510
Never had any issues?

09:41.545 --> 09:43.011
Oh, good.

09:43.046 --> 09:45.807
We don't want to move in, and then
one year later hear a story about...

09:54.190 --> 09:55.256
Yeah.

09:57.294 --> 09:59.660
Anderson: <i>Dr. Nicholas
McGeehan of Human Rights Watch</i>

09:59.695 --> 10:02.596
<i>has been documenting migrant
worker abuse for over a decade.</i>

10:02.632 --> 10:05.332
<i>He wasn't surprised by our findings.</i>

10:05.367 --> 10:07.835
Almost everyone we interviewed,
they sort of describe

10:07.870 --> 10:10.504
being promised one thing
in their home countries,

10:10.540 --> 10:12.540
and they're arriving
and getting a nasty shock.

10:12.575 --> 10:16.143
What happens, yes, is workers sign a
contract in, wherever, Bangladesh, you know,

10:16.178 --> 10:19.146
and they arrive in the UAE, they
find that they sign another contract

10:19.181 --> 10:21.014
for half of what they were promised.

10:21.050 --> 10:22.682
Then, their passports
are taken away from them.

10:22.717 --> 10:25.452
Then, their visa costs
and travel costs are added on.

10:25.487 --> 10:27.354
So very quickly
they move from a situation

10:27.389 --> 10:30.157
where they owe double
what they thought they owed,

10:30.192 --> 10:33.160
and they're paid half of what
they expected to be paid.

10:33.195 --> 10:35.995
Their passport's gone, and they're bound
to the one employer and can't change.

10:36.030 --> 10:39.499
Very quickly it starts to look like,
in many cases, a trafficking network

10:39.534 --> 10:41.701
because of the deception
involved in their recruitment.

10:41.736 --> 10:43.770
And when they're there,
in the worst cases,

10:43.805 --> 10:46.072
you actually have workers
subjected to forced labor.

10:46.107 --> 10:48.174
<i>The workers don't want much.</i>

10:48.209 --> 10:50.709
<i>They just want what they were
promised, which isn't a whole lot.</i>

10:50.744 --> 10:55.014
<i>The system has been built up in such a way
that everybody knows they can make money.</i>

10:55.049 --> 10:57.850
Nothing to be gained from being ethical.
Why would you be ethical

10:57.885 --> 11:00.252
when you can make so much
money from being unethical,

11:00.288 --> 11:01.787
and you're never going
to be prosecuted for it?

11:01.822 --> 11:05.891
<i>The Dubai that's sold
to you in tourist brochures</i>

11:05.926 --> 11:10.529
<i>and is emblazoned across every
building you can see or adverts,</i>

11:10.564 --> 11:13.765
it doesn't reflect
the actual reality,

11:13.801 --> 11:15.534
which is a lot darker.

11:15.569 --> 11:18.837
Anderson: <i>Trump declined to be
interviewed for this piece,</i>

11:18.873 --> 11:21.106
<i>but his organization stated:</i>

11:37.857 --> 11:42.126
<i>They instead put the responsibility
on Trump's UAE partner, DAMAC,</i>

11:42.161 --> 11:43.794
<i>who told us:</i>

11:50.970 --> 11:52.503
<i>The Trump organization added</i>

11:52.539 --> 11:54.839
<i>that if any labor
infractions were proven,</i>

11:54.874 --> 11:57.374
<i>they would insist
that DAMAC investigate.</i>

12:00.479 --> 12:03.980
So even by the unbelievably
low standards of Dubai,

12:04.016 --> 12:08.218
the guys living 18 or 21 to a villa are
getting treated really, really badly.

12:08.254 --> 12:12.322
But just to make sure that the company
doing that to them isn't one bad apple,

12:12.358 --> 12:15.692
I am going to follow back a bunch
of other buses ferrying workers

12:15.727 --> 12:17.460
who are still working
on the Trump golf course

12:17.495 --> 12:19.829
to see how they are getting treated,

12:19.865 --> 12:22.599
and see how it compares to the
guys we have already met.

12:22.634 --> 12:26.302
<i>We followed buses full of
workers as they left the site.</i>

12:26.337 --> 12:30.106
<i>They drove for miles out of
the city and into the desert.</i>

12:30.141 --> 12:32.408
<i>Eventually, there wasn't even a road.</i>

12:32.444 --> 12:36.112
<i>After a two hour drive, they
reached their destination.</i>

12:36.147 --> 12:39.582
<i>Stuck in the middle of nowhere,
this camp was also awful,</i>

12:39.617 --> 12:41.484
<i>and we heard many
of the same stories.</i>

12:41.519 --> 12:44.787
Anderson: They're working on the
golf course? Akoya and Trump?

12:44.822 --> 12:46.521
Yeah.

12:52.964 --> 12:54.396
How many people share this?

12:55.800 --> 12:59.702
Ah, so one gas hob with
two things is for one room.

12:59.737 --> 13:03.271
<i>So this small kitchen
serves roughly 150 workers.</i>

13:03.307 --> 13:06.674
Must be very busy in here
at dinner time.

13:06.710 --> 13:10.678
<i>Just outside the kitchen door was a bathroom
that didn't look fit for human beings.</i>

13:10.714 --> 13:12.080
This is... shower?

13:12.116 --> 13:16.751
This is the washing area, bathroom?

13:16.786 --> 13:19.286
Ugh. You can smell
the sewage.

13:20.824 --> 13:23.457
Is it better here or in Pakistan?

13:23.493 --> 13:24.759
It's better at home.

13:24.794 --> 13:26.227
Can you go home?

13:33.703 --> 13:35.436
Anderson: <i>Whatever his
stated level of involvement,</i>

13:35.471 --> 13:40.841
<i>Trump makes lots of money from licensing
his name and brand to projects like this.</i>

13:40.876 --> 13:43.910
<i>But while that might be ethically
dubious for a businessman,</i>

13:43.946 --> 13:48.349
<i>one would think it would raise serious
questions for a presidential candidate.</i>

13:48.384 --> 13:52.552
<i>Meanwhile, the workers
in Dubai remain trapped,</i>

13:52.587 --> 13:55.321
<i>with no hope
that things might change.</i>

13:57.526 --> 13:58.625
Anderson:
Yeah.

14:09.070 --> 14:11.604

chance things will improve?

14:20.815 --> 14:23.316
China's economy has seen
