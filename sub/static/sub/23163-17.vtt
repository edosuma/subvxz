WEBVTT

00:02.536 --> 00:04.003
<i>Actually, I've been
following you.</i>

00:04.070 --> 00:05.868
It just started happening.

00:05.939 --> 00:07.703
And I am 39!

00:07.775 --> 00:09.106
<i>Oh, yes, but in three days,</i>

00:09.210 --> 00:10.837
the Big 4-0!

00:14.815 --> 00:17.079
<i>You've been paying a lot of
attention to someone I care about.</i>

00:22.890 --> 00:24.915
John Costa is a dangerous man.

00:24.992 --> 00:27.722
<i>This is none of your business,
and neither is my personal life!</i>

02:31.683 --> 02:33.048
Can you get us a cab?

02:34.019 --> 02:35.714
A cab? Sure. Right away.

02:35.787 --> 02:38.483
<i>Uh-uh, no cab. Forget about
it. We're not going home yet.</i>

02:38.557 --> 02:40.252
<i>Well, I've got to make
it an early night, guys.</i>

02:40.325 --> 02:42.054
I got a meeting with
Han Quing in the morning.

02:42.127 --> 02:44.391
<i>Han? Hey, how's he doing?
I haven't seen him in months.</i>

02:44.463 --> 02:46.431
Well I'll let you know
in the morning. Early.

02:46.498 --> 02:49.160
<i>Hey, look, Thomas. I know you've
got to get more sleep at your age,</i>

02:49.234 --> 02:51.065
but I got a surprise
for you. Come on.

02:51.136 --> 02:53.195
<i>Life's supposed
to begin at 40, not end.</i>

02:53.272 --> 02:56.173
<i>I mean, you could be like
George Burns and say you're 39.</i>

02:56.241 --> 02:58.505
<i>That's Jack Benny. Oh
yeah, that's what I meant.</i>

02:58.577 --> 03:00.101
And I am 39!

03:00.178 --> 03:01.543
<i>Oh, yes, but in three days,</i>

03:01.613 --> 03:03.638
the Big 4-0!

03:03.715 --> 03:06.616
<i>And it won't hurt a bit,
Thomas. How do you know?</i>

03:07.085 --> 03:08.416
Ta-da!

03:12.257 --> 03:14.487
Forget it. I ain't going
into one of those places.

03:14.559 --> 03:17.357
<i>Now, look, guys, I passed by
this place on my way to meet you,</i>

03:17.429 --> 03:19.329
<i>and I got this funny feeling
inside about old times,</i>

03:19.398 --> 03:20.490
so I booked a table.

03:20.565 --> 03:21.862
<i>I don't know, Rick.</i>

03:23.235 --> 03:25.726
I haven't been in one
of them places since Nam.

03:26.104 --> 03:27.628
<i>Look, T. C.,
that's the idea.</i>

03:27.706 --> 03:29.264
<i>It'll be just like old times, huh?</i>

03:29.508 --> 03:30.532
Come on!

03:31.977 --> 03:35.469
<i>Come on. Come on, T. C., you
got to go in. It's my birthday.</i>

04:10.415 --> 04:12.007
<i>Sit there, buddy boy.</i>

04:19.991 --> 04:21.048
Buy you a drink?
Sure.

04:21.125 --> 04:22.150
What'll it be?

04:22.227 --> 04:23.455
<i>Champagne cocktail, please. Me, too.</i>

04:23.528 --> 04:25.325
I'll have a beer in a longneck.

04:25.397 --> 04:27.865
<i>T. C? Oh, a soft drink in a bottle.</i>

04:27.966 --> 04:29.297
With the cap on!

04:30.869 --> 04:32.063
I'll have a beer.

04:33.605 --> 04:35.470
<i>Hey, and we'll pay
as we go. No tabs!</i>

04:35.540 --> 04:37.030
I'll get the first round.

04:37.109 --> 04:38.667
<i>Hey, girls, what's your names?</i>

04:38.744 --> 04:40.041
Connie.
Kim.

04:40.112 --> 04:41.704
Somebody get your credit cards?

04:41.780 --> 04:42.906
No. My $2 bill.

04:42.981 --> 04:45.381
Hey! Tell my pal here
happy birthday.

04:45.450 --> 04:47.384
Happy Birthday!
Happy Birthday!

04:47.452 --> 04:48.851
Thank you. Thank you.

04:48.920 --> 04:51.218
<i>Yeah, this does kind of
bring you back.</i>

04:51.289 --> 04:53.484
That'll be $50.
50 bucks?

04:53.692 --> 04:56.024
<i>Man, I told you, we're
just gonna get taken here!</i>

04:56.094 --> 04:59.530
<i>Just like I said before, guys,
it's like old times.</i>

04:59.664 --> 05:01.859
<i>I got it.
Here you go, darling.</i>

05:02.734 --> 05:04.099
<i>Well, to birthdays!</i>

05:04.169 --> 05:06.160
<i>Let's have
a big hand for the girls!</i>

05:06.238 --> 05:07.500
To friendship.

05:16.615 --> 05:17.604
Mmm!

05:17.949 --> 05:20.213
Remember in Da Nang on your
birthday in... Excuse me.

05:20.285 --> 05:21.684
<i>Hey, where're you going?</i>

05:21.753 --> 05:24.415
I'll be right back. I dropped something
in the street. I got to look for it.

05:59.524 --> 06:01.355
Thank you.

06:19.444 --> 06:21.275
I didn't even know I'd lost it.

06:26.418 --> 06:27.908
Neither did I.

06:32.023 --> 06:33.115
Lee!

06:38.864 --> 06:40.058
Get in the car.

07:13.598 --> 07:18.831
The wolf comes in many forms and
shapes throughout the centuries.

07:18.904 --> 07:22.237
<i>Right now, he's taking the two-legged
form, but still running in packs.</i>

07:22.307 --> 07:23.638
What is this?

07:25.844 --> 07:27.709
Drink it.
Darjeeling.

07:28.280 --> 07:31.443
<i>Honest. It's good for
you. No medicinal herbs,</i>

07:31.950 --> 07:33.918
although you
may still need them.

07:35.887 --> 07:38.082
<i>You don't happen to have
a cup of coffee, do you?</i>

07:38.156 --> 07:39.748
Nope. Too much caffeine.

07:40.392 --> 07:42.986
<i>In the old days,
the men of the village</i>

07:43.061 --> 07:46.394
<i>knew exactly what to do to keep
the wolf away from their doors,</i>

07:46.464 --> 07:49.456
<i>especially after a harsh
winter, when hunger...</i>

07:49.968 --> 07:52.402
Hunger makes the wolf
even bolder.

07:52.470 --> 07:55.405
<i>Han, could we jump forward
a couple of centuries?</i>

07:56.908 --> 07:59.001
<i>In the most extreme cases,</i>

07:59.077 --> 08:03.070
they were forced to enlist the
aid of some very resourceful men

08:03.148 --> 08:05.309
in the neighboring village.

08:05.383 --> 08:07.078
<i>Someone, say, like me.</i>

08:08.920 --> 08:10.820
With some loss of face.

08:11.356 --> 08:16.225
<i>Well, what is this wolf
doing to this village here?</i>

08:16.328 --> 08:18.319
<i>Ah! Right now,
he's...</i>

08:18.563 --> 08:19.860
He's just

08:20.465 --> 08:21.454
<i>sniffing around,</i>

08:21.533 --> 08:24.661
<i>circling the vulnerable
and the weak, you see.</i>

08:24.736 --> 08:27.296
<i>Han, we could save a lot of time</i>

08:27.372 --> 08:29.704
if you'd talk about
what you're talking about.

08:29.774 --> 08:30.832
Intimidating.

08:31.042 --> 08:32.030
Threatening!

08:32.277 --> 08:35.303
With what? Protection?
Burglary?

08:35.914 --> 08:37.905
<i>Yeah, that and much more.</i>

08:38.717 --> 08:42.015
A two-legged wolf that travels
in packs sounds like a gang.

08:42.087 --> 08:43.076
Uh-huh.

08:43.587 --> 08:45.488
Good deduction. The wolf.

08:47.459 --> 08:49.427
<i>You haven't changed a bit, Han.</i>

08:49.494 --> 08:51.155
<i>Yeah, neither have you.</i>

08:52.130 --> 08:56.624
<i>Thomas, you know, I wouldn't
bother you with all these little</i>

08:56.935 --> 08:58.027
<i>problems we have here,</i>

08:58.103 --> 09:00.003
except there have
been some rumors.

09:00.905 --> 09:04.363
Well you've always handled gang
problems in the neighborhood yourself.

09:04.442 --> 09:05.636
Not like this.

09:06.011 --> 09:09.276
These rumors say that there's
something heavy going down the pipe.

09:09.347 --> 09:12.510
<i>You know, something that will give
the wolf a great deal of power.</i>

09:13.251 --> 09:15.446
I kept track of
their activities.

09:18.456 --> 09:20.686
<i>These police reports,</i>

09:20.759 --> 09:24.024
<i>court transcripts,
and newspaper articles.</i>

09:24.162 --> 09:27.723
<i>You see, right here, "Running in
packs and with much more power."</i>

09:28.033 --> 09:29.261
Can I keep these?

09:30.502 --> 09:32.060
I make copies for you.

09:32.137 --> 09:34.537
<i>These are my
originals, you know.</i>

09:34.606 --> 09:37.074
<i>Now, if you can
keep an eye on the wolf</i>

09:37.142 --> 09:39.508
<i>and substantiate these
rumors, I'd appreciate it.</i>

09:39.577 --> 09:41.408
Or maybe prove them false.

09:42.514 --> 09:44.175
That's even better.

09:44.983 --> 09:46.541
You know...

09:50.622 --> 09:52.146
<i>My neighborhood, huh?</i>

09:52.390 --> 09:56.588
<i>And any kind of a shameful
problem pop up, you know,</i>

09:56.661 --> 09:58.754
<i>makes the...
Well, makes...</i>

09:59.931 --> 10:01.455
<i>I know, Han. I know.</i>

10:03.501 --> 10:07.733
<i>Of course, we would pay you
your regular fee, plus expenses.</i>

10:07.806 --> 10:09.774
<i>And a big bonus at the end, huh?</i>

10:11.342 --> 10:12.900
<i>Oh, one more thing.</i>

10:13.244 --> 10:15.838
<i>No, no. Don't even mention
it. The police are no good.</i>

10:16.147 --> 10:19.446
<i>They can't keep up with
that wolf, he runs too fast.</i>

10:19.517 --> 10:20.882
Why do you think you are here?

10:20.952 --> 10:23.819
<i>No. You didn't happen to run
across a $2 bill, did you?</i>

10:25.323 --> 10:26.654
What?

10:34.766 --> 10:37.860
<i>My grandfather was one of
the world's great collectors.</i>

10:38.002 --> 10:40.163
<i>He collected souvenirs, stamps,</i>

10:40.405 --> 10:41.394
<i>and friends.</i>

10:41.773 --> 10:45.573
<i>But his prize collection was a
stack of uncirculated currency.</i>

10:45.777 --> 10:49.008
<i>All silver certificates,
all $2 bills.</i>

10:49.881 --> 10:52.213
<i>On my 13th birthday,
he gave me one of them,</i>

10:52.717 --> 10:54.378
<i>and told me to read
the serial number.</i>

10:54.786 --> 10:56.185
<i>It was my birth date.</i>

10:56.688 --> 10:59.213
<i>And in time,
it became my Lucky Two.</i>

10:59.624 --> 11:01.819
<i>And I'd carried it
with me ever since.</i>

11:02.060 --> 11:03.425
<i>Until last night.</i>

11:39.330 --> 11:41.525
<i>Any private investigator
worth his salt</i>

11:41.599 --> 11:44.727
<i>can tell you there's a real
art to the act of surveillance.</i>

11:44.803 --> 11:47.795
<i>First of all, you have to learn
how to be completely inconspicuous</i>

11:47.872 --> 11:49.100
<i>while sitting in your car,</i>

11:49.174 --> 11:50.869
<i>in the same exact spot,</i>

11:50.942 --> 11:53.274
<i>sometimes for days at a time.</i>

11:53.344 --> 11:56.108
<i>Secondly, you have to learn
the various techniques</i>

11:56.181 --> 11:57.910
<i>for keeping yourself alert.</i>

11:57.982 --> 12:01.008
<i>Even though hours can go by
without anything much happening.</i>

12:01.452 --> 12:04.114
<i>And then you have to consider
the person you're tailing.</i>

12:04.189 --> 12:06.180
<i>You can never be sure
if the guy you're following</i>

12:06.257 --> 12:08.054
<i>is going to lead you
to anything worthwhile.</i>

12:08.126 --> 12:09.525
<i>And sometimes
you're not even sure</i>

12:09.594 --> 12:11.152
<i>why you're watching
who you're watching.</i>

12:11.229 --> 12:14.665
<i>But you learn to go on
instinct, and basic gut reaction.</i>

12:16.334 --> 12:19.235
<i>And, usually, that's when
your surveillance pays off.</i>

12:19.938 --> 12:22.099
<i>Of course, that's also
the trickiest part.</i>

12:22.173 --> 12:23.640
<i>Once the subject is in sight,</i>

12:23.708 --> 12:26.541
<i>you have to know just
exactly how close you can get</i>

12:26.611 --> 12:28.340
<i>without giving yourself away.</i>

13:05.149 --> 13:07.310
<i>But every once in a while,
you have to face the fact</i>

13:07.385 --> 13:09.512
<i>that the surveillance
you've put hours into</i>

13:09.587 --> 13:11.452
<i>really isn't going
to help you out.</i>

13:11.689 --> 13:15.819
<i>And a good investigator knows when the
time has come to cut bait and get out.</i>

13:24.002 --> 13:25.333
<i>I know what you're thinking.</i>

13:25.403 --> 13:27.997
<i>Why wasn't I
working on Han's case?</i>

13:28.072 --> 13:30.632
<i>Well, every case
takes its own time</i>

13:30.708 --> 13:33.609
<i>and a good private investigator
knows how not to rush things.</i>

13:33.745 --> 13:34.769
<i>Besides,</i>

13:34.846 --> 13:38.009
<i>I had homework to do before
I leaped right in and...</i>

13:39.284 --> 13:40.444
<i>Actually, you're right.</i>

13:40.652 --> 13:42.415
<i>I was ignoring the case.</i>

14:43.181 --> 14:46.116
<i>I can't believe it!
You get here an hour late,</i>

14:46.184 --> 14:48.618
<i>you start the competition
cold, and you win it anyway!</i>

14:48.686 --> 14:50.051
<i>Win it? Man,
you buried 'em!</i>

14:50.121 --> 14:51.520
Kiki Kuana

14:51.589 --> 14:55.150
has beaten me every time I've raced
her since she was 13 years old.

14:55.226 --> 14:57.194
<i>You guys didn't set this
up or something, did you?</i>

14:57.261 --> 14:58.694
Set it up? What are you talking about?

14:58.763 --> 15:01.163
<i>Hey, Kiki was a flash in the
pan. For six straight years?</i>

15:01.232 --> 15:03.757
<i>Put it out of your head,
Thomas. I put money on this.</i>

15:03.835 --> 15:06.133
<i>Well, that makes me feel
a lot better!</i>

15:07.572 --> 15:08.630
Where you going?

15:08.706 --> 15:10.640
We gotta get the volleyball
competition set up!

15:10.708 --> 15:12.699
<i>Hey! You wanna
win that, don't you?</i>

15:14.712 --> 15:16.612
Thomas!
Where are you going?

15:33.297 --> 15:34.958
<i>I know what you're thinking,
and you're right.</i>

15:35.033 --> 15:36.523
<i>This was beginning
to look a little bit</i>

15:36.601 --> 15:39.468
<i>like those things that happen
to you when you turn 40.</i>

15:39.537 --> 15:43.837
<i>Acting impulsively, sitting in the middle
of the ocean staring at beautiful women...</i>

15:43.908 --> 15:47.173
<i>The kind of traps I'd always
said I wasn't going to fall into.</i>

15:47.678 --> 15:50.112
<i>And I was starting
to feel a little silly.</i>

16:39.979 --> 16:40.968
Higgins!

16:42.215 --> 16:44.240
<i>Magnum, I am terribly sorry.
Did I wake you?</i>

16:44.317 --> 16:45.875
What are you doing
with my gorilla mask?

16:45.952 --> 16:47.419
And why are you
playing my records?

16:47.487 --> 16:49.978
<i>It was on the turntable,
and they're not all yours.</i>

16:50.056 --> 16:52.991
I remind you that part of Mr.
Masters' collection is stored here.

16:53.059 --> 16:56.495
So you decided to take
inventory at 7:00 a. M?

16:56.796 --> 16:58.787
I'm looking for
a particular piece of music

16:58.865 --> 17:00.628
for a function this afternoon.

17:00.700 --> 17:01.997
A function?
What function?

17:02.068 --> 17:03.626
<i>Magnum, please go back to sleep.</i>

17:03.703 --> 17:05.397
I'll be more careful
with the volume.

17:05.472 --> 17:08.464
I wanna know what kind of
function you need my music for.

17:08.540 --> 17:10.805
<i>'Cause that was my record
you were playing, not Robin's.</i>

17:10.877 --> 17:13.038
<i>Not being familiar with
the artists of your era,</i>

17:13.113 --> 17:14.671
I played the record by mistake.

17:14.748 --> 17:15.942
My era?
What does that mean?

17:16.015 --> 17:17.607
<i>Magnum, I really don't
have time for this.</i>

17:17.684 --> 17:20.311
<i>My tea is at 3:00, and I have
a great deal of shopping to do.</i>

17:20.387 --> 17:22.320
You don't have to go shopping!

17:22.388 --> 17:25.186
<i>Not unless you really want
to, but you don't have to.</i>

17:25.258 --> 17:26.555
You understand?

17:26.626 --> 17:29.493
This incoherence can only be
attributed to a lack of sleep.

17:29.562 --> 17:31.962
<i>Magnum, please, feel free to go back to...</i>

17:32.031 --> 17:34.261
I don't want to
go back to sleep.

17:34.334 --> 17:38.031
But you obviously need rest. You're
being quite irritable and you look tired.

17:38.104 --> 17:42.404
<i>Oh, I get it. I'm going to have to
start listening to all the "old" lines.</i>

17:42.475 --> 17:44.102
<i>Old and tired, just like that.</i>

17:44.177 --> 17:46.771
<i>I have no idea what you're talking
about. Oh, no, of course not.</i>

17:46.846 --> 17:49.371
<i>Well, it doesn't matter, because
I don't feel any different.</i>

17:49.449 --> 17:52.441
<i>So if you're expecting me to start
making a fool out of myself, Higgins,</i>

17:52.519 --> 17:54.817
<i>I'm sorry. Same old clothes,
same old music,</i>

17:54.888 --> 17:57.379
<i>no lifestyle changes,
no chasing after women.</i>

17:57.457 --> 17:59.584
I thought you said
no lifestyle changes?

17:59.659 --> 18:00.921
I mean

18:01.461 --> 18:02.792
that I don't need

18:03.062 --> 18:06.691
a new woman in my life just
to prove that I can get one.

18:07.000 --> 18:09.560
Just start
following somebody around

18:09.636 --> 18:11.263
because they're young
and beautiful.

18:11.337 --> 18:14.306
<i>No, I agree. You're getting a bit
mature for brainless beach bunnies.</i>

18:14.374 --> 18:16.205
Who said anything
about the beach?

18:16.676 --> 18:19.975
<i>And there is a difference,
Higgins, between mature and old.</i>

18:20.046 --> 18:21.673
<i>Indeed, there is.</i>

18:22.415 --> 18:24.178
<i>Magnum, is something
troubling you?</i>

18:24.250 --> 18:26.514
<i>Yes, as a matter of fact,
Higgins. Your attitude.</i>

18:26.586 --> 18:29.453
<i>Because no matter what you
think, I am not falling into</i>

18:29.589 --> 18:30.578
"the traps."

18:31.124 --> 18:34.719
<i>I think that you have made one sensible
statement, and I've agreed with you.</i>

18:34.794 --> 18:36.853
That to pursue a woman
only for her beauty

18:36.930 --> 18:38.693
and to prove that she could
find you attractive

18:38.765 --> 18:40.892
would be both foolish
and juvenile.

18:40.967 --> 18:43.902
<i>But since you've just vowed
that you're not doing that,</i>

18:44.504 --> 18:45.835
why are we discussing it?

18:45.905 --> 18:47.236
We're not!

18:47.674 --> 18:50.438
And I have work to do.
But I'll be back before 3:00.

19:00.253 --> 19:01.948
<i>No matter what
I had told Higgins,</i>

19:02.021 --> 19:04.046
<i>I know I had come
dangerously close</i>

19:04.123 --> 19:06.148
<i>to falling into
the 40-year-old trap.</i>

19:06.392 --> 19:09.418
<i>Fortunately,
I had caught myself in time.</i>

19:09.496 --> 19:12.624
<i>I was definitely off the girl and
back on the case with the Wolf.</i>

20:10.023 --> 20:11.718
<i>All right, Lee, rolling.</i>

20:12.158 --> 20:13.750
<i>However, this wasn't always so.</i>

20:13.826 --> 20:17.091
<i>In 1791, British Captain
George Vancouver</i>

20:17.163 --> 20:20.189
reported sighting
the first Chinese in Hawaii

20:20.266 --> 20:23.099
and branding them
as renegades and bandits.

20:23.202 --> 20:26.069
<i>On the other hand,
these alleged wrong-doers</i>

20:26.139 --> 20:29.233
taught King Kamehameha the
Great many useful strategies

20:29.309 --> 20:32.301
<i>regarding oriental
and occidental warfare,</i>

20:33.246 --> 20:37.410
which may have influenced his ability
in uniting the Islands later on.

20:40.420 --> 20:42.320
The next wave of
Chinese immigrants

20:42.388 --> 20:44.413
came over as plantation workers

20:44.490 --> 20:47.118
and we'll have more on that story tomorrow.

20:47.193 --> 20:50.959
This is Linda Lee Ellison
reporting for KSHL-TV.

20:52.398 --> 20:54.559
<i>Okay, Lee. Great.
Next setup.</i>

20:54.634 --> 20:56.431
<i>Yeah, just give me a minute.</i>

20:57.270 --> 20:58.259
Hi.

20:59.372 --> 21:00.600
Hello.

21:02.475 --> 21:04.443
I found your earring.

21:05.011 --> 21:06.342
No.

21:06.946 --> 21:07.935
Last night.

21:10.049 --> 21:11.346
<i>Oh, yes.</i>

21:12.352 --> 21:13.717
I remember.

21:14.187 --> 21:15.381
Oh?

21:16.889 --> 21:18.379
I'm Thomas Magnum.

21:18.458 --> 21:20.289
I'm Linda Lee Ellison.

21:20.393 --> 21:21.792
I know. I heard.

21:24.430 --> 21:26.057
<i>So, what are you doing here?</i>

21:26.132 --> 21:27.622
I lost a...

21:28.401 --> 21:30.392
A $2 bill.

21:30.470 --> 21:32.665
<i>It wasn't any $2 bill.
I mean, it was, uh,</i>

21:34.107 --> 21:35.131
special.

21:35.208 --> 21:37.506
<i>Come on, Lee. You making the move with us?</i>

21:41.547 --> 21:42.707
<i>Well,</i>

21:43.383 --> 21:44.372
thanks again.

21:44.884 --> 21:47.978
I don't suppose I could
interest you in a cup of coffee?

21:54.260 --> 21:55.818
<i>Addendum to turning 40.</i>

21:56.062 --> 21:57.290
<i>It only happens once,</i>

21:57.363 --> 22:00.594
<i>so probably the best thing
to do is not try to decide</i>

22:00.667 --> 22:02.862
<i>exactly how you're going
to respond to it.</i>

22:03.903 --> 22:05.598
<i>Just enjoy whatever happens.</i>

22:05.672 --> 22:08.368
<i>So there I was, in the
middle of a dry river bed,</i>

22:08.441 --> 22:10.466
doing a story
on white-river rafting.

22:11.911 --> 22:14.937
It must be very exciting

22:15.014 --> 22:18.506
to work on something and see
it come to life on the air.

22:18.885 --> 22:20.978
<i>Well, I'm not exactly
Geraldo Rivera.</i>

22:21.754 --> 22:23.915
I just do fluff.
Happy news.

22:24.691 --> 22:27.125
<i>You know, a boy and his dog,</i>

22:27.193 --> 22:29.559
twins being reunited
after 45 years...

22:30.296 --> 22:31.593
Human interest.

22:32.365 --> 22:33.354
But I like it.

22:34.801 --> 22:36.928
So what was so special
about your $2 bill?

22:37.003 --> 22:39.665
My grandfather gave it to me when I was 13.

22:39.839 --> 22:42.865
<i>So you're gonna stay in Chinatown
until you find it, right?</i>

22:42.942 --> 22:45.604
<i>No, I was here on a case.</i>

22:46.145 --> 22:49.012
A case?
I'm a private investigator.

22:49.682 --> 22:50.910
Really.

22:52.018 --> 22:53.349
What are you working on?

22:53.419 --> 22:55.114
It's something for a friend.

22:55.621 --> 22:56.883
Dangerous?

22:58.558 --> 23:01.550
It's not that big a deal.

23:01.627 --> 23:03.686
I don't think there's
a story in it for you.

23:03.763 --> 23:06.163
You never know when you're
gonna trip over that story

23:06.232 --> 23:08.029
that's gonna make you
rich and famous.

23:08.101 --> 23:10.626
<i>Well, I think you're doing
pretty good in that department.</i>

23:10.703 --> 23:13.399
<i>You're a feature reporter,
you've got a house on the beach...</i>

23:14.674 --> 23:17.302
What makes you think I
have a house on the beach?

23:19.645 --> 23:20.942
<i>Actually,</i>

23:21.981 --> 23:23.972
last night wasn't the only time

23:25.084 --> 23:26.449
that I've seen you.

23:26.652 --> 23:29.120
I happened to be driving down Kahala Avenue

23:29.188 --> 23:30.678
after I saw you

23:31.891 --> 23:33.222
in the morning...

23:34.494 --> 23:37.986
<i>Actually, I happened
to be driving by the studio</i>

23:39.198 --> 23:40.722
just after you came out.

23:41.567 --> 23:43.432
<i>Actually, I've been
following you.</i>

23:46.272 --> 23:48.035
I didn't plan it that way.

23:49.909 --> 23:52.503
It just started to happen.

23:56.649 --> 23:58.708
You probably think
I'm a little strange.

24:01.521 --> 24:03.284
I think you're very nice.

24:04.690 --> 24:05.714
Yeah?

24:06.526 --> 24:07.515
Yes.

24:12.131 --> 24:13.792
I'd better go.

24:13.866 --> 24:16.130
I think I have to
reshoot that one.

24:16.202 --> 24:19.103
I wasn't really concentrating! Wait.

24:22.008 --> 24:24.033
I was wondering...

24:25.912 --> 24:28.244
I'm involved with someone.

24:28.714 --> 24:30.545
You're married?

24:31.150 --> 24:32.139
No.

24:34.587 --> 24:36.020
Are you?

24:39.292 --> 24:40.281
No.

24:43.296 --> 24:44.661
<i>Well, then?</i>

24:46.098 --> 24:47.463
I really have to go.

24:47.533 --> 24:50.525
I can't let them start
the show without me.

24:53.005 --> 24:54.563
It was nice seeing you

24:54.974 --> 24:55.963
again.

24:59.345 --> 25:00.972
Good-bye.

25:17.597 --> 25:20.293
Kenji said you wanted to see
me? Yes. Where have you been?

25:20.366 --> 25:22.493
This morning you indicated
you'd be back by 3:00.

25:22.568 --> 25:25.503
<i>Oh, I'm sorry, Higgins. If I'd known
you'd gone to all this trouble...</i>

25:25.571 --> 25:28.335
What are you talking about? Tea. You know.

25:28.407 --> 25:30.204
What are you talking about?

25:30.276 --> 25:31.573
I don't like tea that much.

25:31.644 --> 25:35.045
But in this case I'll make an
exception. It's a sweet thing to do.

25:35.114 --> 25:37.810
I'm afraid I haven't
a place for you.

25:37.884 --> 25:40.580
<i>Oh, I get it. You want me
to think you've forgotten?</i>

25:40.653 --> 25:43.645
Forgotten what? That's very
good. That's very convincing.

25:43.723 --> 25:45.816
<i>If I didn't know you so
well, I'd almost believe it.</i>

25:45.892 --> 25:48.224
<i>As much as I'd love to stand
here bandying words with you,</i>

25:48.294 --> 25:50.626
I do have guests.
But... Higgins?

25:50.696 --> 25:53.460
What did you want to see me about? What?

25:54.467 --> 25:56.799
<i>Oh, yes.
Your mother called.</i>

25:56.869 --> 26:00.361
<i>She called here? Twice. As did
Rick. It was urgent, as usual.</i>

26:00.773 --> 26:02.570
<i>If you're planning on
returning your mother's call,</i>

26:02.642 --> 26:06.703
please show her the courtesy of remembering
the time difference in Tidewater!

26:15.955 --> 26:19.220
<i>Thomas, give me a call. I
got some information for you.</i>

26:19.292 --> 26:21.192
<i>There's this guy, he's bad news.</i>

26:21.260 --> 26:23.228
<i>His name is John Walter Costa.</i>

26:23.296 --> 26:26.561
<i>Don't you do anything
until you talk to me, okay?</i>

26:28.334 --> 26:31.303
<i>One of these days, I'm gonna
catch you when you're there.</i>

26:31.370 --> 26:33.634
<i>I hope your birthday package
got there okay.</i>

26:33.706 --> 26:34.968
<i>It got here, Mom.</i>

26:35.041 --> 26:36.906
<i>We all wanted to wish you
a happy birthday,</i>

26:36.976 --> 26:39.501
<i>and Billy wants to know when
you're coming home for a visit.</i>

26:39.578 --> 26:41.705
<i>Anyway, I'll try again later.</i>

26:41.781 --> 26:43.908
<i>Love you, Tommy.</i>

26:46.953 --> 26:48.420
It's too late.

26:50.456 --> 26:52.014
<i>Hi, you still up?</i>

26:52.124 --> 26:54.251
<i>Who did you think was calling?</i>

26:54.327 --> 26:55.521
Who's this?

26:55.594 --> 26:58.495
<i>We haven't met yet, Mr.
Magnum. My name's John Costa.</i>

26:58.764 --> 27:00.823
<i>And I think you know
what this is about.</i>

27:02.468 --> 27:03.765
What do you want?

27:03.836 --> 27:05.133
<i>A friendly meeting.</i>

27:05.705 --> 27:08.173
<i>Front of the building,
next to Wo Fat's Chop Suey.</i>

27:08.240 --> 27:09.298
<i>In an hour.</i>

27:21.754 --> 27:23.244
<i>Help me, mister!
Please! Please!</i>

27:23.322 --> 27:25.017
My grandmother!
It's her heart!

27:25.091 --> 27:26.718
Please help me!
Where is she?

27:26.792 --> 27:28.726
She's down here.
Please help me!

27:28.794 --> 27:30.455
<i>Hurry, please!</i>

27:45.578 --> 27:48.046
You're probably wondering
why I asked you here.

27:48.114 --> 27:49.547
You're John Costa?

27:51.150 --> 27:53.880
You've been paying a lot of
attention to someone I care about.

27:55.588 --> 27:57.556
<i>Now, I'm only gonna
say this once.</i>

27:57.623 --> 27:58.851
No more following the car.

28:00.026 --> 28:02.358
No more surf-skiing
off my beach.

28:03.095 --> 28:05.563
<i>No more little get-togethers in Chinatown,</i>

28:09.702 --> 28:11.829
I'm glad we had a chance
to clear this up.

28:14.340 --> 28:16.137
Stay away from her.

28:35.761 --> 28:37.626
<i>It's your mother again.</i>

28:37.696 --> 28:39.926
<i>Hope you're not out
having too much fun.</i>

28:39.999 --> 28:43.662
<i>Anyway, maybe I'll
get lucky tomorrow.</i>

28:43.736 --> 28:44.725
<i>Bye-bye.</i>

28:57.116 --> 28:58.879
<i>Sorry, Mom.</i>

29:06.692 --> 29:07.784
<i>It's your nickel.</i>

29:07.860 --> 29:10.157
It's five nickels nowadays.

29:10.263 --> 29:11.148
<i>Hey, Thomas.</i>

29:11.173 --> 29:13.763
I'm glad you called before you
did anything about this Costa guy.

29:13.899 --> 29:15.161
He's major-league
bad news.

29:16.435 --> 29:18.767
Are you sure his
name's John Costa?

29:18.838 --> 29:20.863
<i>Yeah.
I'm positive. Why?</i>

29:20.940 --> 29:23.534
Nothing. Just
a funny coincidence.

29:23.609 --> 29:26.669
Turns out he made a killing in
the stock market a few years back.

29:26.745 --> 29:29.111
The FBI figures that he
parlayed it into arms dealing.

29:29.181 --> 29:31.342
Well there's nothing illegal
about arms dealing.

29:31.417 --> 29:32.543
It is when they're stolen.

29:32.651 --> 29:36.212
This guys makes a living by paying
people to rip off military installations.

29:36.288 --> 29:38.848
Then he makes a profit
by selling the stolen weapons.

29:38.924 --> 29:40.323
<i>And, Thomas,</i>

29:40.392 --> 29:43.691
this guy's got a reputation for
making people that cross him disappear.

29:45.097 --> 29:48.157
<i>Yeah, thanks, Rick. Look, I hope I
didn't put you in a bind with Ice Pick.</i>

29:48.267 --> 29:49.928
I didn't call Ice Pick.

29:50.102 --> 29:52.263
<i>Well, then how'd you get
this stuff on Costa?</i>

29:52.338 --> 29:54.238
I called Carol
at the D.A.'s office.

29:54.306 --> 29:55.330
Oh.

29:56.742 --> 29:58.937
<i>You watch this guy, you hear?</i>

29:59.178 --> 30:00.509
Thanks for the warning.

30:08.487 --> 30:10.751
What are you doing?

30:12.525 --> 30:15.961
Looking for these. I see
you've been beaten up again.

30:16.028 --> 30:19.259
<i>The Baseball Concordia.
The Passing Attack.</i>

30:19.331 --> 30:20.696
Those are my books.

30:20.766 --> 30:24.167
<i>Zen Infield, foreworded by Catfoot Blevens.</i>

30:24.236 --> 30:25.726
It's "Catfish" Blevens!

30:25.804 --> 30:28.295
<i>And they are not your books,
they belong to Robin Masters</i>

30:28.374 --> 30:30.433
and they're to be treated
with the same respect

30:30.509 --> 30:32.238
as if they were
actually valuable.

30:32.311 --> 30:33.539
They are!

30:35.514 --> 30:37.846
<i>Oh, I get it.</i>

30:37.917 --> 30:39.885
You weren't looking
for the books.

30:39.952 --> 30:41.783
You couldn't possibly
have even known I had them.

30:41.854 --> 30:43.947
Who else would plunder them from the library?

30:44.023 --> 30:46.651
You were sneaking around
looking for my telephone book.

30:46.725 --> 30:48.317
This is a sweet thing
you're doing.

30:48.394 --> 30:50.191
Don't be ridiculous.

30:50.262 --> 30:53.459
Why on earth would I want
your telephone book?

30:53.532 --> 30:55.523
So you can call up
all my friends.

30:55.601 --> 30:59.037
Do you realize how
patently absurd that sounds?

30:59.104 --> 31:00.799
<i>Oh, of course, you're right.</i>

31:02.274 --> 31:05.072
You couldn't possibly
wanna call up all my friends.

31:05.144 --> 31:06.702
<i>But just in case
you need me tomorrow,</i>

31:06.779 --> 31:08.269
<i>for anything at all,</i>

31:08.347 --> 31:09.405
I won't be here.

31:09.882 --> 31:11.247
Oh? Where will you be?

31:50.990 --> 31:52.958
What are you doing here?

31:54.026 --> 31:55.994
I'm not completely sure.

31:56.395 --> 31:57.862
<i>Look, I admire
persistence, but...</i>

31:57.930 --> 31:59.522
How well do you know John Costa?

31:59.598 --> 32:00.587
What?

32:00.766 --> 32:02.256
<i>I know you're involved with him,</i>

32:02.334 --> 32:05.064
but how well do you know him?

32:05.137 --> 32:08.106
<i>Is this a professional
inquiry, or a personal one?</i>

32:08.173 --> 32:10.300
Maybe both.
What are you working on?

32:10.376 --> 32:11.604
This is none of your business.

32:11.677 --> 32:13.110
And neither is my personal life!

32:13.178 --> 32:15.373
John Costa is a dangerous man.

32:15.648 --> 32:18.242
<i>As far as I can tell, he's
hired a Chinatown street gang,</i>

32:18.317 --> 32:19.909
<i>the friendly little boys
on your tape there,</i>

32:19.985 --> 32:22.180
to steal some weapons
from a military base.

32:22.254 --> 32:23.983
And he has a penchant
for physical violence.

32:24.056 --> 32:25.546
<i>If you don't know any of this,</i>

32:26.225 --> 32:27.954
you could be in
real danger yourself.

32:29.061 --> 32:30.221
Get out.

32:30.462 --> 32:31.724
Maybe you do.

32:32.564 --> 32:34.759
<i>And if that's the case, and
you don't do anything about it,</i>

32:34.833 --> 32:37.233
you're as good
as in it with him.

32:56.722 --> 32:59.088
I just had to get that
out of my system.

33:20.579 --> 33:22.479
<i>My first year
in Junior High School,</i>

33:22.548 --> 33:24.448
<i>I tried out for the school play.</i>

33:24.516 --> 33:26.677
<i>Partly because I wanted
to play Thomas Jefferson,</i>

33:26.752 --> 33:29.220
<i>someone I'd always
considered my namesake,</i>

33:29.288 --> 33:30.482
<i>but mostly,</i>

33:30.556 --> 33:34.390
<i>because I wanted to walk Mary
Ellen Moffat home from rehearsals.</i>

33:34.460 --> 33:37.293
<i>She played Martha Wayles
Skelton Jefferson.</i>

33:37.429 --> 33:40.592
<i>I waited for her after every
rehearsal, but she kept avoiding me.</i>

33:41.400 --> 33:44.130
<i>Finally, one day,
she walked right up to me,</i>

33:44.203 --> 33:46.637
<i>looked at me, smiled, and said,</i>

33:46.772 --> 33:48.603
<i>"You better stop
waiting around for me"</i>

33:48.674 --> 33:51.108
<i>"or my boyfriend's
gonna pound you."</i>

33:51.443 --> 33:54.378
<i>That's the day I decided
to join the Foreign Legion.</i>

34:03.088 --> 34:04.419
It's open.

34:07.593 --> 34:09.322
There's someone here to see you.

34:21.170 --> 34:22.467
This won't hurt.

34:26.877 --> 34:28.310
Sorry.

34:30.179 --> 34:31.579
Automatic reflex.

34:38.455 --> 34:40.547
I'm...

34:42.025 --> 34:43.652
I feel really...

34:46.764 --> 34:49.562
I wasn't sure you would even
talk to me after this afternoon.

34:49.632 --> 34:51.760
<i>Look, I was way out of line.</i>

34:52.603 --> 34:53.831
I didn't exactly...

34:54.705 --> 34:55.933
You were right.

34:56.674 --> 34:59.609
I was involved with John's
business in Chinatown.

34:59.677 --> 35:01.702
But not the way you think.

35:02.179 --> 35:03.271
What do I think?

35:03.347 --> 35:05.440
I was on the trail of a story.

35:05.516 --> 35:06.744
A big story.

35:08.485 --> 35:11.318
And when I realized I was
in too deep to get out.

35:12.856 --> 35:14.824
I discovered the story was John.

35:14.892 --> 35:16.416
<i>Look, you don't have to
talk about this.</i>

35:16.493 --> 35:19.894
<i>I thought I could keep him away
from finding out what I knew,</i>

35:19.964 --> 35:22.558
at least long enough
to get it on the air.

35:25.135 --> 35:27.603
But I wasn't that clever.

35:31.008 --> 35:32.373
How much do you know?

35:34.912 --> 35:37.210
I'm walking away from the story.

35:42.519 --> 35:44.248
I think you should.

35:48.192 --> 35:51.127
<i>Look, I didn't plan it this way,</i>

35:51.195 --> 35:54.528
but the case I'm working on involves Costa.

36:00.237 --> 36:02.535
Is that why you were
following me around?

36:02.639 --> 36:03.663
No.

36:05.509 --> 36:07.306
<i>I didn't know that
when I met you,</i>

36:08.078 --> 36:09.602
and I didn't know that
when we had coffee.

36:10.314 --> 36:11.303
I didn't.

36:14.918 --> 36:18.752
<i>Listen, you don't have to have anything
to do with him. I can handle it.</i>

36:18.889 --> 36:21.915
If he finds out I told you
anything... He can't get to you here.

36:21.992 --> 36:23.857
I'm not worried about myself.

36:23.961 --> 36:25.428
There are dozens of people
I've talked to.

36:25.496 --> 36:27.327
<i>And if he did this to me,
imagine what he will do to...</i>

36:27.398 --> 36:29.866
What's he gonna do to them
if he's not stopped?

36:36.407 --> 36:37.704
I don't know.

36:38.342 --> 36:40.833
You can't protect them
with silence.

36:51.722 --> 36:53.155
Hello?

36:55.225 --> 36:57.193
<i>Yeah, I took care
of it, Rick. Thanks.</i>

37:00.130 --> 37:02.325
I gotta get something in the
bedroom. I'll be right back.

37:17.014 --> 37:18.106
<i>Hi, Han, it's me.</i>

37:18.182 --> 37:19.410
<i>Hey, who's Rick?</i>

37:19.483 --> 37:20.973
<i>And why'd you hang up, huh?</i>

37:21.051 --> 37:23.383
<i>Well, that's kind of a long story. What's up?</i>

37:23.554 --> 37:26.523
Did I ever tell you the story
about my grandfather's village

37:26.590 --> 37:28.524
<i>during the time of the
bandits? And you see...</i>

37:28.592 --> 37:31.652
<i>Han, it's late. I'm tired. Could
you do this in the short form?</i>

37:31.728 --> 37:34.720
Just tell me about your neighborhood
instead of your grandfather's?

37:34.798 --> 37:39.326
<i>Well, I did hear something
but maybe it's nothing.</i>

37:41.205 --> 37:42.672
<i>Are you there?
Yes!</i>

37:43.240 --> 37:44.832
<i>Well, it's about this kid, see.</i>

37:45.075 --> 37:46.406
He runs with the Wolf.

37:47.010 --> 37:48.671
<i>Talks a lot, talks a lot.</i>

37:48.745 --> 37:51.805
He said he's gonna meet
with Costa tonight.

37:53.050 --> 37:55.177
<i>Maybe he's just talking, huh?</i>

37:56.086 --> 37:57.075
Maybe.

37:57.654 --> 37:58.643
Any idea where?

37:59.289 --> 38:00.415
Where...

38:00.958 --> 38:03.449
Sanju... Sanju Pagoda.

38:07.564 --> 38:08.997
I'll check it out.

38:10.300 --> 38:15.067
<i>Thomas, hey, I'm sorry I
call during dinner hour, huh?</i>

38:15.339 --> 38:16.829
That's okay. I've eaten.

38:16.907 --> 38:18.340
<i>Junk food, huh?</i>

38:19.409 --> 38:21.070
No more junk food.
I'm 40 now.

38:42.366 --> 38:44.857
I have to run some tickets
over to a friend.

38:45.369 --> 38:47.496
He has to have them tonight?

38:48.772 --> 38:50.637
You're safe here.

38:50.874 --> 38:52.637
<i>If you want to get some sleep,
you can use the bedroom.</i>

38:52.709 --> 38:54.609
I'll stay out here tonight.

38:54.678 --> 38:55.940
How long will you be gone?

38:56.246 --> 38:57.338
Not long.

39:45.395 --> 39:46.885
<i>Kind of late for you
to be out, isn't it?</i>

40:40.550 --> 40:42.848
I held these back as a sort of bonus for you.

40:46.456 --> 40:47.753
<i>You don't have to
count this, do you?</i>

40:48.525 --> 40:50.322
We know where you live.

40:51.628 --> 40:53.892
Tell your guys
they did a good job.

40:53.964 --> 40:55.693
Next time
I'm in the market for...

40:55.766 --> 40:58.234
<i>This is the police.
We have you surrounded.</i>

40:58.335 --> 40:59.393
It's a setup!
Let's get out of here.

40:59.469 --> 41:00.561
<i>Throw down your weapons.</i>

41:02.306 --> 41:04.297
<i>Throw your weapons down!</i>

41:04.374 --> 41:07.343
<i>Place your hands
behind your head...</i>

41:10.447 --> 41:12.506
<i>I repeat: This is the police.</i>

41:21.425 --> 41:22.653
<i>Cease firing!</i>

41:23.193 --> 41:24.490
<i>Cease firing!</i>

41:25.562 --> 41:27.291
<i>Throw down your weapons!</i>

41:29.900 --> 41:31.367
Freeze!

41:39.242 --> 41:40.971
<i>There's one in the back, there.</i>

42:03.266 --> 42:05.962
Let him go! He was the one
I was telling you about!

42:18.014 --> 42:20.608
<i>Stand by.
All right, Lee, go.</i>

42:21.017 --> 42:23.144
<i>In a dramatic
development in Chinatown,</i>

42:23.320 --> 42:24.912
Channel 3 was on the scene

42:24.988 --> 42:27.855
when war broke out
between an Asian gang group

42:27.924 --> 42:31.121
and alleged arms
dealer John Costa.

42:31.695 --> 42:34.528
<i>For some weeks, this investigative reporter</i>

42:34.598 --> 42:36.259
has been on the trail of a story

42:36.333 --> 42:38.563
which you see unfolding
here tonight.

42:38.635 --> 42:40.830
<i>Initially, there was
no information</i>

42:40.904 --> 42:45.534
<i>but Channel Three is going to bring
you full coverage on the story,</i>

42:45.609 --> 42:50.740
<i>which will reveal bribery,
grand theft, collusion,</i>

42:50.814 --> 42:52.406
and the simmering...

42:56.686 --> 43:01.180
And the simmering violence
beneath the tranquil exterior

43:01.725 --> 43:03.215
of Chinatown.

43:05.729 --> 43:07.720
<i>Listen, why don't you
set up over there</i>

43:07.798 --> 43:09.163
so we can cover the bust?

43:10.534 --> 43:11.523
Okay.

43:21.445 --> 43:24.608
Why didn't you trust me enough
to tell me where you were going?

43:26.016 --> 43:28.849
You listened in on my conversation with Han.

43:29.586 --> 43:31.110
You knew what was
going down tonight.

43:31.188 --> 43:33.486
Why didn't you tell me? Why'd
you just let me walk into this?

43:34.090 --> 43:36.081
I saved you!

43:36.159 --> 43:38.059
<i>You planned on doing your
report all along, didn't you?</i>

43:38.628 --> 43:40.493
I wasn't!

43:42.899 --> 43:44.867
I got worried about you.

43:44.935 --> 43:46.459
That explains the police.

43:47.571 --> 43:49.505
It doesn't explain this.

43:49.706 --> 43:51.435
<i>Lee, we're losing this!
Let's go!</i>

43:53.343 --> 43:55.402
<i>Thomas, I wasn't really
gonna do the story.</i>

43:55.479 --> 43:57.310
<i>I was gonna
put it to rest, but...</i>

44:13.964 --> 44:15.955
Go finish your report.

44:28.945 --> 44:30.674
<i>All right, Lee, go.</i>

44:31.581 --> 44:33.481
<i>According to police sources,</i>

44:33.583 --> 44:34.880
members of the Wolf gang

44:34.951 --> 44:38.580
<i>and former financier John
Costa have been arrested,</i>

44:38.989 --> 44:42.322
<i>and will be charged with
possession of military weapons,</i>

44:42.392 --> 44:44.724
<i>attempted murder of police
officers, and related felonies.</i>

44:50.500 --> 44:52.263
Surprise!

44:52.335 --> 44:54.860
Happy Birthday!
Happy Birthday!

45:02.212 --> 45:05.272
I believe I actually
convinced you I'd forgotten!

45:05.348 --> 45:07.077
<i>Higgins, you...</i>

45:07.150 --> 45:08.947
You did all this?
Quite.

45:09.019 --> 45:12.750
<i>Happy birthday, Thomas. Yeah.
You don't look a day over 39.</i>

45:13.089 --> 45:14.886
<i>Well, maybe a day over.</i>

45:18.628 --> 45:20.528
<i>Happy birthday, Magnum.</i>

45:20.997 --> 45:22.794
<i>Thanks, Higgins.</i>

45:30.907 --> 45:32.033
Where was it?

45:32.108 --> 45:34.576
In the cash register
at Wo Fat's Chop Suey.

45:39.382 --> 45:41.282
This isn't...
What?

45:41.785 --> 45:45.619
<i>Nothing, Higgins.
Thank you. Thanks, guys.</i>

45:48.191 --> 45:50.819
<i>Look, can you just
give me a minute? I...</i>

45:55.799 --> 45:58.393
<i>The FBI has informed us
that additional charges</i>

45:58.468 --> 46:02.928
<i>relating to illegal weapons statutes
will be filed against John Costa,</i>

46:03.006 --> 46:05.873
<i>a bizarre twist in the life
of the well-known...</i>

46:05.942 --> 46:07.807
<i>Hello?
Mom!</i>

46:08.745 --> 46:09.939
Did I wake you?

46:10.013 --> 46:11.071
What?

46:11.948 --> 46:13.643
What time is it?

46:14.417 --> 46:15.975
I woke you.

46:19.556 --> 46:21.786
<i>Tom, is that you?</i>

46:21.858 --> 46:24.850
<i>I'm sorry I woke you.
It's still my birthday here.</i>

46:24.928 --> 46:26.691
Did you get my package?

46:27.897 --> 46:29.194
The shirt's great.
I love it.

46:30.700 --> 46:34.101
<i>You sound pretty good.
Is everything okay?</i>

46:34.170 --> 46:36.195
<i>Investigation by our morning
special features reporter.</i>

46:36.272 --> 46:38.103
<i>And full details surrounding
this controversial...</i>

46:38.174 --> 46:39.732
Just a minute.

46:39.809 --> 46:41.777
<i>Will be discussed on
tomorrow morning's final look</i>

46:41.845 --> 46:44.006
<i>at "Chinatown: Yesterday,
Today and Tomorrow"...</i>

46:49.386 --> 46:50.375
Hi.

46:50.754 --> 46:53.348
<i>You know,
you shouldn't be up so late.</i>

46:53.990 --> 46:56.515
You gotta start
pacing yourself now.

46:57.160 --> 46:58.787
<i>Mom, I'm only 40.</i>
