WEBVTT

00:07.656 --> 00:09.923
- It's ready?
- She's ready!

00:11.123 --> 00:13.256
Start uploading
her operating system.

00:15.689 --> 00:17.689
We're almost there.

00:17.789 --> 00:18.856
- It's too much data.

00:18.956 --> 00:21.256
We're overloading the systems.

00:21.356 --> 00:22.456
We're not gonna make it!

00:22.556 --> 00:25.823
- The artificial synapses
have to kick in.

00:30.889 --> 00:32.723
- No.

00:37.856 --> 00:39.289
- Hello?

00:44.456 --> 00:46.389
- Frankie?

00:46.489 --> 00:48.856
- Dr. Mom?

00:50.000 --> 00:56.074

contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:59.023 --> 01:02.123
Yo, Frankie,
can you give me a hand?

01:02.223 --> 01:03.989
- Here.

01:05.723 --> 01:07.923
Still not used
to this part of my job.

01:08.023 --> 01:10.223
Can you help me
get this box to the hall?

01:13.923 --> 01:16.923
- I know, Will, but tonight
is my big meeting.

01:17.023 --> 01:19.056
I'm presenting Frankie
to Mr. Kingston.

01:19.156 --> 01:20.823
It's a big deal.

01:20.923 --> 01:23.256
Of course Jenny's birthday's
a big deal, too.

01:23.356 --> 01:26.889
I'm doing everything I can
to be home by 8, but my boss...

01:26.989 --> 01:28.989
- Boss really
stepped in it, huh?

01:29.089 --> 01:31.223
- Dr. Mom?
What did she step in?

01:31.323 --> 01:32.589
I shall clean her shoes.

01:32.723 --> 01:35.223
- No, no, I mean she's
in trouble with her husband.

01:35.323 --> 01:36.489
You know, Will?

01:36.589 --> 01:37.723
- I do know Will Gaines.

01:37.823 --> 01:40.756
Born February 25, 1980,
in Boston, Massachusetts.

01:40.856 --> 01:43.723
Blogger and author of multiple
unpublished self-help books.

01:43.756 --> 01:45.456
He enjoys mountain biking,
Broadway plays,

01:45.556 --> 01:46.923
mountain biking
to Broadway plays...

01:47.023 --> 01:48.556
- Settle down, Frankie-opedia.

01:48.723 --> 01:50.723
- Dr. Gaines, Mr. Kingston
is ready to see you.

01:50.823 --> 01:51.923
And you must hurry.

01:52.023 --> 01:54.156
Everyone is waiting
to see the new model.

01:56.289 --> 01:58.723
- Do you think this demo's gonna
go better than the last one?

01:58.823 --> 02:00.956
- Of course.
Kingston is going to love her.

02:01.056 --> 02:02.723
- That's what you said
last time, and then...

02:02.789 --> 02:05.723
- Oh, could we not
talk about Eliza.

02:05.789 --> 02:07.356
Besides, the demo was fine.

02:07.456 --> 02:09.489
It wasn't until afterwards...
- I thought you didn't

02:09.589 --> 02:11.989
wanna talk about Eliza.
- Right.

02:12.089 --> 02:13.289
I don't.

02:13.389 --> 02:15.556
Kingston is going to love her.

02:15.723 --> 02:17.256
Come on.

02:20.456 --> 02:21.589
And begin.

02:25.623 --> 02:27.289
- Three minutes
and twenty-three seconds.

02:27.389 --> 02:29.256
- Impressive.

02:32.089 --> 02:35.123
- It is 7:43,
post meridian time.

02:35.223 --> 02:36.756
- I know.

02:36.856 --> 02:39.756
With my new integrated circuits,
the android's motherboard

02:39.856 --> 02:42.189
resembles a human brain
and can actually learn

02:42.289 --> 02:44.589
and use its experience
to act independently.

02:46.156 --> 02:48.723
Dr. Gaines, I thought
I made myself perfectly clear

02:48.756 --> 02:51.023
after our last... situation.

02:51.123 --> 02:54.323
I do not want computers
thinking or making decisions.

02:54.423 --> 02:55.723
It's just too risky.

02:55.789 --> 02:57.789
- But Mr. Kingston, it's not
going to be like last time.

02:57.889 --> 02:59.323
I fixed all those problems.

02:59.423 --> 03:00.956
You've got to be kidding.

03:01.056 --> 03:02.489
Additional testing begun.

03:02.589 --> 03:03.956
- Um, what are you doing?

03:04.056 --> 03:05.756
Demonstrating
visual and cognitive abilities.

03:05.856 --> 03:06.923
You are late
for Jenny's birthday.

03:07.023 --> 03:08.756
- Is she malfunctioning?
- No!

03:08.856 --> 03:10.989
- Done. Now strength.

03:14.723 --> 03:15.523
- Please stop.

03:15.623 --> 03:16.923
- Next, physical dexterity.

03:19.189 --> 03:22.456
Dr. Gaines,
this is madness.

03:22.556 --> 03:23.723
You see what I mean?

03:23.823 --> 03:26.556
This is why we cannot have
independent androids.

03:26.723 --> 03:27.623
Shut her off.

03:27.723 --> 03:29.356
Give me that. I'll do it.

03:29.456 --> 03:31.723
- No, I've got it.
You don't know the interface.

03:31.756 --> 03:33.889
- Do not touch Dr. Mom.

03:33.989 --> 03:35.623
- What did she just say?

03:35.723 --> 03:36.856
Dr. Mom?

03:36.956 --> 03:38.189
Oh please.

03:38.289 --> 03:41.856
And you call
yourself...

03:41.956 --> 03:45.423
Okay, get control
of your android this instant!

03:45.523 --> 03:47.556
Put me down.

03:47.723 --> 03:49.323
- Frankie, I need you
to listen to me.

03:49.423 --> 03:50.589
I don't need assistance.

03:50.723 --> 03:53.489
And I've rescheduled
Jenny's birthday celebration.

03:53.723 --> 03:54.723
Everything is fine.

03:54.789 --> 03:57.256
Please put Mr. Kingston down.

03:59.356 --> 04:00.423
- Thank you.

04:00.523 --> 04:01.556
- Presentation complete.

04:01.723 --> 04:04.023
- I want that robot
destroyed immediately.

04:04.123 --> 04:05.723
Stripped down to its components.
- But...

04:05.823 --> 04:08.389
- But, Mr. Kingston, sir,
this android

04:08.489 --> 04:11.523
would be a perfect candidate
for Project Q.

04:11.623 --> 04:12.889
- Good point, PEGSI.

04:12.989 --> 04:14.123
Don't destroy it.

04:14.223 --> 04:16.123
Bring it to Sector Seven
and deactivate it.

04:16.223 --> 04:18.523
We'll use it for Project Q.

04:18.623 --> 04:19.822
- What is Project Q?

04:19.923 --> 04:21.055
- Mr. Kingston, sir,

04:21.156 --> 04:23.189
Warpa insists
on strict confidentiality.

04:23.289 --> 04:24.223
- Warpa?

04:24.323 --> 04:25.889
- Deliver the android
to Sector Seven.

04:27.223 --> 04:30.023
Better yet, I'll send someone
to pick it up.

04:30.123 --> 04:31.756
- Mr. Kingston, please,
if I could just have...

04:31.856 --> 04:36.223
- No, you can
just do as I say... now!

04:56.769 --> 04:59.202
- No way am I giving her up
to Warpa.

04:59.302 --> 05:00.335
She deserves better

05:00.469 --> 05:02.102
than whatever those monsters
have planned.

05:02.202 --> 05:04.702
- I hear you, but it's not
like you have any choice.

05:04.802 --> 05:06.335
Kingston calls the shots
around here.

05:06.469 --> 05:07.469
Where are you going?

05:07.569 --> 05:08.802
- Getting out of here.

05:08.902 --> 05:11.669
I have had it with Kingston
and this place.

05:11.769 --> 05:14.335
And I'm taking Frankie with me.

05:14.469 --> 05:16.135
Frankie, what are you doing?

05:17.969 --> 05:20.102
- Oh my, what is that?

05:20.202 --> 05:22.202
a flour-based pastry

05:22.302 --> 05:23.902
used to celebrate
a human's date of birth.

05:24.002 --> 05:25.135
Chocolate with vanilla frosting.

05:25.235 --> 05:27.502
My calculations confirm
a delicious combination.

05:27.602 --> 05:28.602
- You made this?

05:28.702 --> 05:30.135
- For Jenny Gaines.

05:32.202 --> 05:34.869
- Ah, this is all
really touching.

05:34.969 --> 05:37.002
But you all gotta
get out of here like yesterday.

05:37.102 --> 05:39.169
- That is chronologically
and spatially impossible.

05:39.269 --> 05:42.169
- How are we gonna get Frankie
out without anyone noticing?

05:49.235 --> 05:50.569
- Clear.

05:58.469 --> 06:00.069
- You heard about what happened
to Kingston tonight?

06:00.169 --> 06:02.769
- Yeah.
He got owned by a crazed robot.

06:15.802 --> 06:17.269
- Oh!
- Hey!

06:17.369 --> 06:18.235
Watch it!

06:18.335 --> 06:20.135
- Sorry, I didn't
see you, Peter.

06:20.235 --> 06:23.869
Just, uh, taking
these tools to the office.

06:23.969 --> 06:27.702
- Wait. Shouldn't your
assistant be doing that?

06:27.802 --> 06:31.069
- Uh... yeah... he should.

06:31.169 --> 06:32.702
Where is that guy?

06:32.809 --> 06:35.009
You know, he is fired.

06:41.202 --> 06:43.135
- Boss, we have a problem.

06:45.369 --> 06:48.135
- Dr. Gaines?

06:48.235 --> 06:50.469
She is not doing
what I think she's doing.

06:50.502 --> 06:51.935
- I believe she is.

06:52.035 --> 06:52.969
- Alert security.

06:53.069 --> 06:54.635
- Already did.

07:10.102 --> 07:11.802
- Stop right there.

07:11.902 --> 07:12.835
- Mr. Kingston.

07:12.935 --> 07:14.869
- Dr. Gaines.

07:14.969 --> 07:18.169
Show me what's under
that sheet... right now.

07:27.377 --> 07:30.477
- I should have known
you'd try something like this.

07:30.577 --> 07:32.577
How dare you defy me

07:32.677 --> 07:36.111
and steal technology
from my lab?

07:37.311 --> 07:39.044
- It's my daughter's
birthday today.

07:39.211 --> 07:42.011
At least for three more hours.

07:42.111 --> 07:45.977
- So the android
is still inside?

07:46.077 --> 07:47.711
- Of course.

07:55.073 --> 07:56.207
- We're just
backing up her files.

07:56.307 --> 07:58.107
You'll have your android
tomorrow.

08:01.840 --> 08:03.540
- Good.

08:15.140 --> 08:17.140
- Coast is clear.

08:17.240 --> 08:19.173
- The coast?
- But we are not by an ocean.

08:19.273 --> 08:21.407
- I mean, we made it out.

08:21.507 --> 08:23.507
We're safe.

08:26.407 --> 08:28.773
- My mapping app
recognizes this route.

08:28.873 --> 08:30.773
Are we going...
- Yes.

08:30.873 --> 08:32.240
Home.

08:34.907 --> 08:36.273
- So you... you stole?

08:36.373 --> 08:38.073
- Well, she's
my intellectual property,

08:38.173 --> 08:41.039
but technically,
I guess I kinda did.

08:41.140 --> 08:42.873
- This is just too much
to throw at us.

08:42.972 --> 08:44.540
Why don't you
just take her back?

08:44.640 --> 08:46.607
I bet you no one
will even realize she was gone.

08:46.707 --> 08:48.907
- No way! I can't let Warpa
get their hands on her.

08:49.007 --> 08:50.307
- You could be arrested.

08:50.507 --> 08:52.840
- I'd rather go to jail
than let someone use technology

08:52.940 --> 08:54.507
I created to hurt people.

08:54.607 --> 08:57.240
- You don't know...
- I know Kingston.

08:57.340 --> 08:59.573
I'm doing the right thing.

09:02.407 --> 09:06.740
- Plus, I can't let them
take Frankie away.

09:06.840 --> 09:10.073
We've been together since
she was just a ball of wires

09:10.173 --> 09:12.240
and circuits.

09:12.340 --> 09:15.740
I built her,
but it's more than that.

09:15.840 --> 09:19.673
I feel like I raised her.

09:19.773 --> 09:21.073
She's family.

09:21.173 --> 09:22.507
- Are we going to sing
"Happy Birthday"?

09:22.607 --> 09:24.740
It was Dr. Mom's
main objective today.

09:24.840 --> 09:25.907
- Dr. Mom, eh?

09:26.007 --> 09:28.107
- Yes.

09:28.207 --> 09:29.573
Let's get to it, shall we?

09:29.673 --> 09:31.007
Jenny, I'm home!

09:31.107 --> 09:33.407
- Mom, finally.

09:39.973 --> 09:41.007
- Who is she?

09:41.107 --> 09:43.740
- This is Frankie.

09:43.840 --> 09:46.173
- Surprise!
- Happy Birthday!

09:46.273 --> 09:47.507
Excuse its deformed appearance

09:47.540 --> 09:49.240
due to the hasty
laboratory escape.

09:49.340 --> 09:52.173
- She's the android I've been
working on for three years.

09:52.273 --> 09:54.007
- Is she my birthday present?

09:54.107 --> 09:56.540
- No. Even better.

09:56.640 --> 09:58.173
She's going to be
living with us.

09:58.273 --> 09:59.907
- Surprise!
- Happy Birthday!

10:00.007 --> 10:00.940
- What?

10:01.040 --> 10:03.407
Here? In my room?

10:03.507 --> 10:07.307
- Oh no, sweetie,
you don't have to share rooms.

10:07.407 --> 10:08.473
Because we're moving.

10:08.573 --> 10:10.007
- Surprise.
- Happy Birthday!

10:10.107 --> 10:11.740
- I don't understand.

10:11.840 --> 10:13.207
Where are we going?

10:13.307 --> 10:17.907
- I made a list
of some possibilities.

10:18.007 --> 10:20.707
- 33.5067 degrees north.

10:20.807 --> 10:23.040
Nice. I hear they have
good schools there.

10:23.140 --> 10:25.173
- They're GPS coordinates.

10:25.273 --> 10:27.307
You know, I think in numbers.

10:36.640 --> 10:39.207
- So, here it is.

10:39.307 --> 10:41.373
- Thank you so much, James.

10:41.473 --> 10:44.707
- My pleasure to help
an old lab buddy.

10:44.807 --> 10:46.040
Especially if it means

10:46.140 --> 10:49.007
I get to stick it to Kingston
one last time.

10:49.107 --> 10:51.507
So, what do you think?

10:51.540 --> 10:53.007
- I love it.
- I like it.

10:53.107 --> 10:54.507
- I hate it.

10:54.573 --> 10:56.140
- Three bedrooms,
24-hour security, balcony.

10:56.240 --> 10:57.673
- Well, how's the power supply?

10:57.773 --> 11:01.240
- It can handle
all your equipment, no worries.

11:01.340 --> 11:03.507
So which girl's the android?

11:03.540 --> 11:04.740
- I am.

11:04.840 --> 11:06.540
I deduce that Jenny Gaine's
blank facial expression

11:06.640 --> 11:08.707
is her attempt to hide
her displeasure with this home.

11:08.807 --> 11:10.540
- Great work, Sigourney.

11:10.640 --> 11:12.140
What did you use
for a microprocessor?

11:12.240 --> 11:14.273
- I made my own.
Synapse based.

11:14.373 --> 11:15.907
- Oooh, can I take a look?

11:16.007 --> 11:16.940
Oh.

11:17.040 --> 11:18.107
It's okay.

11:18.207 --> 11:19.507
You don't have to worry
about EGG here.

11:19.607 --> 11:21.507
Rancho is practically
off the grid.

11:21.607 --> 11:24.173
- I know someone
I'd like to push off the grid.

11:24.273 --> 11:26.773
- Jenny, please.

11:26.873 --> 11:28.707
Frankie is one of us now.

11:28.807 --> 11:30.607
She's like... your sister.

11:30.707 --> 11:31.707
- No she's not!

11:31.807 --> 11:32.973
She's not even human.

11:33.073 --> 11:33.973
- Jenny.

11:34.073 --> 11:35.373
- She's amazing, Sigourney.

11:35.507 --> 11:37.007
How did she perform
in field testing?

11:37.107 --> 11:38.307
- Well, she hasn't had any yet.

11:38.407 --> 11:39.673
Just three weeks in the lab.

11:39.773 --> 11:41.507
But I think she's ready
for the field.

11:41.540 --> 11:42.773
I'm sending her to school.

11:42.873 --> 11:44.507
- Seriously?
- School?

11:44.540 --> 11:46.107
Honey, really, that's...
- Nice.

11:46.207 --> 11:48.040
- Well, I think
she can pull it off.

11:48.140 --> 11:50.040
It might be
a little rough at first,

11:50.140 --> 11:52.373
but she's highly adaptable.

11:52.507 --> 11:55.107
I'm enrolling her at
Sepulveda High in the morning.

11:55.207 --> 11:57.240
- Sepulveda High,
home of the Chargers.

11:57.340 --> 11:58.707
A charger is a horse
trained for battle

11:58.807 --> 12:00.307
or a device
that supplies electricity

12:00.407 --> 12:01.840
to battery-powered equipment.

12:01.940 --> 12:04.240
- Be sure to tell everyone that
on your first day of school.

12:04.340 --> 12:05.640
You'll be a huge hit.

12:15.073 --> 12:16.773
- This is a blast, Mom.

12:16.873 --> 12:18.140
- It is?

12:18.240 --> 12:20.840
Oh, good, I thought you'd be
upset about having to get up

12:20.940 --> 12:22.873
hours before your first day
at a new school

12:22.973 --> 12:24.173
to help set up my lab.

12:26.607 --> 12:29.407
- What is that awful noise?

12:32.173 --> 12:33.207
- Curious ducks.

12:33.307 --> 12:34.740
The distinctive ringtone
you downloaded

12:34.840 --> 12:36.740
onto your mobile device
so you'd always recognize it.

12:36.840 --> 12:37.940
- Right.

12:38.040 --> 12:39.873
Now I remember why
I keep my phone on vibrate.

12:39.973 --> 12:43.040
Keep working,
I may have to take the call.

12:45.373 --> 12:47.507
- I'm trying to think
of a reason to like you,

12:47.540 --> 12:49.107
but I'm not coming up with any.

12:49.207 --> 12:50.740
- Perhaps I can be
of some assistance.

12:50.840 --> 12:52.773
Searching reasons
to like someone.

12:52.873 --> 12:54.140
- No, please don't.

12:54.240 --> 12:56.107
- Their general demeanor,
their ability to produce humor,

12:56.207 --> 12:58.673
their ability to be there
for another in times of crisis,

12:58.773 --> 13:00.673
their ability to turn
a potentially boring situation

13:00.773 --> 13:01.907
into a fun one.

13:02.007 --> 13:03.107
Is this making you like me?

13:03.207 --> 13:04.740
- Actually,
it's doing the opposite.

13:04.840 --> 13:05.807
Terminate search.

13:05.907 --> 13:07.773
- Search terminated.

13:07.873 --> 13:09.973
- I know it's not your fault
we had to move,

13:10.073 --> 13:11.407
but I had a perfect life.

13:11.507 --> 13:14.507
I went to a great school
with great places to hang out.

13:14.540 --> 13:16.740
I had friends
to laugh at weird stuff with.

13:16.840 --> 13:18.007
I had fun.

13:18.107 --> 13:20.173
Now I'm in this strange place
that isn't my home,

13:20.273 --> 13:22.107
and all I've got is you.

13:22.207 --> 13:24.173
And a whole lot of cardboard.

13:30.307 --> 13:31.407
- What are you doing?

13:31.507 --> 13:33.573
- Creating fun
for Jenny Gaines.

13:58.273 --> 13:59.640
- What is this?

13:59.740 --> 14:01.707
- A collection of photos
and videos that have been deemed

14:01.807 --> 14:05.340
hilarious by many computer,
smartphone, and tablet users.

14:06.873 --> 14:09.073
That was like
my favorite meme this year.

14:15.140 --> 14:16.807
This is amazing, Frankie.

14:16.907 --> 14:18.107
How'd you do it?

14:19.640 --> 14:21.307
- I can populate and extract
large amounts of data

14:21.407 --> 14:24.340
from anywhere on Earth
at a rapid rate.

14:24.507 --> 14:25.873
- Hey, Frankie.

14:25.973 --> 14:28.107
What else can you
do with these boxes?

14:29.673 --> 14:32.507
- I am Lady Jennifer Gaines.

14:32.540 --> 14:34.507
First of her name
and queen of this land.

14:34.540 --> 14:35.640
Try what you will,

14:35.740 --> 14:38.407
but I will not give up my castle
without a fight.

14:40.740 --> 14:42.307
- My cardboard sword
lacks the tensile strength

14:42.407 --> 14:43.707
to pierce the defenses.

14:43.807 --> 14:46.640
Frankie, Jenny, could
you come to the kitchen, please?

14:46.740 --> 14:48.540
- Aah.

14:51.173 --> 14:53.707
Ow, Frankie!

14:53.807 --> 14:56.073
- James and I kept in touch
after he left EGG.

14:56.173 --> 14:58.040
We've been friends
since our old hacking days.

14:58.140 --> 15:00.273
Of course, he doesn't
work at EGG anymore.

15:00.373 --> 15:02.007
What's he doing now?

15:02.107 --> 15:04.873
- Why don't you take a picture,
it'll last longer.

15:04.973 --> 15:06.940
Okay.

15:09.240 --> 15:10.773
- Bye, Mom, Dad.

15:10.873 --> 15:13.540
- Come back here, young lady.
You're forgetting something.

15:14.640 --> 15:17.307
Have a good day.

15:17.407 --> 15:18.907
You should go, too.
Do you know the way?

15:19.007 --> 15:20.973
- Yes, my maps
are all up to date.

15:21.073 --> 15:22.140
- Of course they are.

15:22.240 --> 15:24.807
Now remember, no one
can find out your secret.

15:24.907 --> 15:26.707
If anyone finds out
there's an android at school,

15:26.807 --> 15:27.907
we'll have to move again.

15:28.007 --> 15:30.507
We can't let Mr. Kingston
find you.

15:30.573 --> 15:33.173
- I remember, the command
is in my file system.

15:35.973 --> 15:36.907
- Oh hang on.

15:37.007 --> 15:38.373
You're forgetting
something, too.

15:38.507 --> 15:40.540
- What?

15:44.640 --> 15:46.007
- A touch of the lips to cheek.

15:46.107 --> 15:48.307
Is this commanded for departures
in all situations?

15:48.407 --> 15:49.640
- It's called a kiss.

15:49.740 --> 15:51.673
- So I should offer a kiss
to all humans

15:51.773 --> 15:52.973
every time
they depart my presence?

15:53.073 --> 15:54.807
- Uh no, not everyone.

15:54.907 --> 15:57.573
Just some people,
and not always.

15:59.273 --> 16:02.173
For now,
it's just for you and me.

16:07.940 --> 16:10.507
Students,
this is Frankie Gaines.

16:10.540 --> 16:13.107
Now, Frankie, why don't you say
a little bit about yourself

16:13.207 --> 16:15.173
to your new classmates?

16:15.273 --> 16:16.407
- A little bit about yourself.

16:18.607 --> 16:21.773
- Looks like we've got
a comedian on our hands.

16:21.873 --> 16:22.940
- We do?

16:23.040 --> 16:25.240
- Ms. Hough, could I talk
to you for a moment?

16:25.340 --> 16:26.507
- Have fun, Frankie.

16:26.607 --> 16:29.507
And remember,
treat one another as if...

16:29.607 --> 16:33.040
We're all kittens
wearing mittens.

16:33.140 --> 16:36.007
- Oooh, that's right.

16:44.640 --> 16:46.873
- Frankie, you can take a seat.

16:48.307 --> 16:49.740
You did this?

16:49.840 --> 16:50.707
- Yes.

16:50.807 --> 16:53.107
- This was my equation.

16:53.207 --> 16:55.107
You had no right.

16:55.207 --> 16:57.907
Now I have to start all over,
because it's probably...

16:58.007 --> 16:59.407
- It's right!
You solved it!

16:59.507 --> 17:00.373
- What?

17:00.507 --> 17:01.507
- That's not fair.

17:01.607 --> 17:02.607
I was about to get it.

17:02.707 --> 17:03.673
- Incorrect.

17:03.773 --> 17:06.507
You forgot a parentheses here.

17:06.540 --> 17:08.007
- Well done, Frankie.

17:08.107 --> 17:09.040
So now if we all...

17:09.140 --> 17:12.839
- Mr. Manhart,
this was my equation.

17:12.940 --> 17:14.906
- Sorry, Brain Squad only.

17:15.007 --> 17:17.873
And mind your own equation
next time.

17:17.973 --> 17:19.673
- Why don't you
leave her alone?

17:19.772 --> 17:21.740
- Uh, why don't you
leave your face alone?

17:21.839 --> 17:23.240
- Sick burn, Tammy.

17:23.339 --> 17:26.573
Next time, try one
that actually makes sense.

17:30.407 --> 17:33.207
Come on, Equation Sensation,
there's a seat back here by me.

17:33.307 --> 17:34.540
- Thank you.

17:34.640 --> 17:36.207
But my name is Frankie,
not Equation Sensation.

17:36.307 --> 17:37.340
- Right.

17:37.507 --> 17:38.673
I'm Dayton, like the city.

17:38.773 --> 17:39.607
- Dayton, Ohio.

17:39.707 --> 17:41.407
Population 141,003.

17:41.507 --> 17:42.573
- Wow.

17:42.673 --> 17:44.573
What are you? Part computer?

17:44.673 --> 17:46.507
Do not
reveal android status.

17:46.540 --> 17:47.773
- Would you ladies
please take your seats?

17:47.873 --> 17:49.873
- Come on. And don't mind Tammy.

17:49.973 --> 17:52.707
She's just bitter and smart.

17:52.807 --> 17:53.907
A lethal combo.

17:54.007 --> 17:56.073
- Lethal to humans
or all forms of life?

17:56.173 --> 17:59.840
- You and I
are gonna get along just fine.

18:11.673 --> 18:13.173
- Awesome solution
for that equation.

18:13.273 --> 18:15.373
No one's been able
to solve it all year.

18:15.507 --> 18:18.407
- Thank you, Bryon Patrick.

18:18.507 --> 18:20.773
- You remembered my name.

18:20.873 --> 18:23.040
Did I tell you my name?

18:25.107 --> 18:28.640
- Well, if it isn't
the Equation Burglar.

18:28.740 --> 18:30.540
- Thanks a lot
for solving my problem.

18:30.640 --> 18:31.640
- You're welcome.

18:31.740 --> 18:33.140
- We'll make sure
to return the favor.

18:33.240 --> 18:34.307
- Perfect.

18:34.407 --> 18:35.707
I need a favor now.

18:35.807 --> 18:37.507
I was told to go
to the locker hallway

18:37.573 --> 18:38.507
after math class.

18:38.607 --> 18:39.807
There's no such location
on my map.

18:39.907 --> 18:41.007
Could you direct me?

18:43.140 --> 18:45.740
- Yeah, down those stairs,
down the hallway,

18:45.840 --> 18:47.773
then straight out the door
at the end.

18:47.873 --> 18:49.340
- But the door sticks.

18:49.507 --> 18:50.873
Make sure you get
a running start.

18:50.973 --> 18:52.673
- Thank you. Now we are even.

18:52.773 --> 18:54.407
- We sure are.

18:57.107 --> 18:58.073
- Don't.

18:58.173 --> 18:59.773
They just sent you
to the indoor pool.

18:59.873 --> 19:01.640
That door was installed
in the wrong spot.

19:01.740 --> 19:03.507
You walk through it,
and you fall right in.

19:03.540 --> 19:04.640
- That would be
a serious problem.

19:04.740 --> 19:06.040
- Uh, it's just a prank.

19:06.140 --> 19:07.507
Little water never hurt anyone.

19:07.573 --> 19:08.540
- It will hurt me.

19:08.640 --> 19:10.340
I can't get wet,
no exceptions.

19:10.507 --> 19:11.673
- Whoa.

19:11.773 --> 19:13.607
Do you have Aquagenic urticaria?

19:13.707 --> 19:14.973
I've read about that.

19:15.073 --> 19:16.873
It's a really rare disease.

19:16.973 --> 19:19.807
- Aquagenic urticaria,
also known as water allergy.

19:19.907 --> 19:21.773
And, yes, it is extremely rare.

19:21.873 --> 19:24.040
It affects every
1 out of 230 million people.

19:24.140 --> 19:26.173
- Then I'm glad I stopped you.

19:26.273 --> 19:28.140
Come on, I'm heading
to the cafeteria.

19:28.240 --> 19:30.373
We can talk revenge
along the way.

19:37.507 --> 19:39.673
- Dr. Gaines?

19:39.773 --> 19:40.807
Dr. Gaines?

19:40.907 --> 19:41.973
- Not back yet.

19:42.073 --> 19:44.207
But the android
has been here all night.

19:48.407 --> 19:49.540
- Don't distract me, man,

19:49.640 --> 19:51.373
I'm almost out of
the killer zombie penguin tomb.

19:51.473 --> 19:54.240
- What is this?

19:54.340 --> 19:56.240
Where is the android?

20:00.073 --> 20:01.173
- Where is the android?

20:01.273 --> 20:03.073
- That's really
a Dr. Gaines question.

20:03.173 --> 20:04.507
- And where is Dr. Gaines?

20:04.607 --> 20:05.773
- Don't know.

20:05.873 --> 20:08.140
- You have 15 seconds
to get out of my sight.

20:08.240 --> 20:10.307
- I'm going.
- I'm going, I'm going.

20:10.407 --> 20:12.640
- No, not you, I was speaking
to my former employee,

20:12.740 --> 20:14.407
you digital dunce.

20:16.307 --> 20:20.973
- Just remembered, Dr. Gaines
did say to give you this.

20:29.990 --> 20:32.690
- PEGSI, we have got
to find that android

20:32.790 --> 20:35.123
or Warpa will have our hides
if we don't.

20:35.223 --> 20:36.590
- I don't have a hide, sir.

20:36.690 --> 20:37.890
- No.

20:37.990 --> 20:40.090
No, you have a titanium shell
which they will pop open

20:40.190 --> 20:41.856
like a can of tuna.

20:41.956 --> 20:44.990
- We've got to find
that android.

20:54.756 --> 20:56.156
- You better hurry, Gaines,

20:56.256 --> 20:57.523
it looks like
it's going to pour.

20:57.623 --> 21:00.123
- Yes, there's a 90% chance
of rain in the next...

21:00.223 --> 21:01.956
...five minutes.

21:02.090 --> 21:04.456
- Yeah, those Cirrostratus
clouds look pretty threatening.

21:04.556 --> 21:06.090
- You are mistaken,
Bryon Patrick.

21:06.156 --> 21:07.756
Those are Cumulonimbus clouds.

21:07.856 --> 21:10.090
You can tell because
the top is smooth.

21:11.290 --> 21:12.856
- Yeah, whatever.

21:12.956 --> 21:14.423
Good luck getting home
without getting wet.

21:14.523 --> 21:15.590
- Thank you.

21:15.690 --> 21:17.090
But I need speed not luck.

21:17.190 --> 21:19.623
By my calculations, I need
to travel at 20 miles per hour

21:19.723 --> 21:22.090
in order to make it home
before the rain arrives.

21:27.945 --> 21:29.778
Warning,
inadequate shelter found.

21:29.945 --> 21:31.945
Start emergency getaway.

21:59.945 --> 22:01.645
- Hey, Cole!

22:07.451 --> 22:09.051
- Urgent!
- Liquid detected!

22:09.151 --> 22:10.985
Important! Locate
shelter immediately!

22:15.818 --> 22:17.385
- Saved ya.

22:20.818 --> 22:24.018
- This is a debacle.
Nice job, Lucia.

22:24.118 --> 22:27.218
- How can you blame me?
I didn't cause the rain.

22:27.318 --> 22:29.218
- True. But it was
your idea to test

22:29.318 --> 22:31.985
our electrolyte sports beverage
prototype on the tennis team.

22:32.085 --> 22:33.885
I wanted to use
the lacrosse team.

22:33.985 --> 22:35.785
They practice
in the rain.

22:35.885 --> 22:37.385
- Hey!
- Hi, Tammy.

22:39.251 --> 22:40.585
Wanna try our new
sports drink?

22:40.651 --> 22:42.351
- I'll need to take your
blood sample, first,

22:42.451 --> 22:44.418
and then another one
20 minutes afterwards.

22:44.585 --> 22:46.051
- Oh, and what have
you eaten today?

22:46.151 --> 22:48.585
- I don't want any
of your stupid drink.

22:50.485 --> 22:53.485
- Why are you standing
out in the rain?

22:53.585 --> 22:55.985
- Cole's tennis practice
is definitely cancelled.

22:56.085 --> 22:57.818
The northern shift
in the jet stream action

22:57.918 --> 22:59.585
resulted in this
moist-tropical air.

22:59.651 --> 23:01.751
- Did I ask
for a weather report?

23:01.851 --> 23:05.285
- Maybe if you had,
you wouldn't be all wet now.

23:05.385 --> 23:07.918
- Oh! Can you believe her?

23:08.018 --> 23:09.385
Cole's talking
to the new girl.

23:09.485 --> 23:12.351
- So?
- So, Tammy likes Cole.

23:12.451 --> 23:14.118
If Cole likes
the new girl,

23:14.218 --> 23:15.751
it'll create
a love triangle that...

23:15.851 --> 23:18.285
Wait. It's not
a love triangle.

23:18.385 --> 23:20.718
It's just a love
acute angle.

23:20.818 --> 23:22.385
OMG.

23:22.485 --> 23:24.985
- Would you put
a sock in it, Lucia?

23:26.451 --> 23:29.318
That's two strikes on
Little Miss Equation Stealer.

23:33.918 --> 23:36.618
- I saw you just standing
here getting soaked and...

23:36.718 --> 23:39.151
I guess a little
rain never hurt anybody.

23:39.251 --> 23:40.818
- On the contrary.

23:40.918 --> 23:42.118
Contact with moisture
of any kind

23:42.218 --> 23:44.185
can cause catastrophic
system failure.

23:44.285 --> 23:47.585
- For your computer?
In your backpack?

23:49.018 --> 23:52.185
Anyway, it's a good
thing I had an umbrella.

23:52.285 --> 23:54.785
- Agreed. Thank you.
- Wait...

24:02.585 --> 24:03.851
Defeated. Sagittarius.

24:03.951 --> 24:05.585
At the Creation. Vibes.

24:05.618 --> 24:06.818
- I know, Frankie.

24:06.918 --> 24:10.318
- Bricks. The in-mat.
Hung the way. Don't chip much.

24:10.418 --> 24:13.018
- Whoa, word salad.

24:13.118 --> 24:14.885
I think our robot
is defective.

24:14.985 --> 24:16.251
Is she still
under warranty?

24:16.351 --> 24:18.818
Let's return her and get
a smart TV instead.

24:20.618 --> 24:23.918
- Je... Jenny Gaines.
Impossibility. Culture. Morning.

24:24.018 --> 24:25.318
- Frankie got a little wet.

24:25.418 --> 24:29.018
- I am fi...
fi... fi... fine.

24:29.118 --> 24:31.851
- Seriously, Mom,
is she okay?

24:31.951 --> 24:34.118
Is this going to
be like last time?

24:34.218 --> 24:36.218
Is Frankie going to...
- Definitely not.

24:36.318 --> 24:38.285
Look, she's going
to be fine.

24:38.385 --> 24:41.051
Frankie, please run
your system diagnostics.

24:41.151 --> 24:43.418
Wet circuits.

24:43.585 --> 24:45.785
Your robot contains
moisture-sensitive components.

24:45.885 --> 24:48.251
Your mileage may vary.
Batteries not included.

24:48.351 --> 24:50.451
- This is serious.
I can't leave her.

24:50.585 --> 24:52.351
Do you know where
the supermarket is?

24:52.451 --> 24:54.251
- Yes, it's just
down the block.

24:54.351 --> 24:56.051
- Here's what we'll need,

24:56.151 --> 24:59.018
and ask someone
at the store to help you.

24:59.118 --> 25:00.885
And to get it
all back here,

25:00.985 --> 25:04.985
you're going to have
to "borrow" a shopping cart.

25:05.085 --> 25:06.318
- Borrow?

25:06.418 --> 25:07.585
You mean "steal"?

25:07.618 --> 25:09.585
You're telling
your own daughter to steal?

25:09.618 --> 25:12.785
- Oh, it's not stealing,
it's borrowing...

25:12.885 --> 25:13.985
without asking.

25:26.585 --> 25:28.285
That was so awesome.

25:28.385 --> 25:31.051
- I think...
something's happening.

25:31.151 --> 25:33.318
- Dr. Mom, why am
I sitting in a bathtub

25:33.418 --> 25:34.885
full of dehydrated grains?

25:34.985 --> 25:36.351
- It's instant rice,
Frankie.

25:36.451 --> 25:39.218
It's absorbing the moisture
from your circuits.

25:39.318 --> 25:41.085
- Oh, like what you
do when you drop

25:41.185 --> 25:43.485
a phone in the toilet.

25:45.318 --> 25:47.018
Uh, I mean,
I think it's working.

25:47.118 --> 25:48.951
- Oh, no, Frankie,
stay there.

25:49.051 --> 25:51.751
You're gonna be okay...
I hope.

25:53.818 --> 25:55.751
Running diagnostics.

25:55.851 --> 25:56.718
Pass.

25:56.818 --> 25:59.018
Network Interface
Controller: Pass.

25:59.118 --> 26:00.418
Pass.

26:00.585 --> 26:02.785
Fail.

26:04.385 --> 26:05.585
- Is that bad?

26:05.618 --> 26:08.118
- Well, let's not rush
to any conclusions.

26:08.218 --> 26:10.685
I need to look inside.

26:19.118 --> 26:22.285
- Well, gross and fine motor
skills look all right.

26:22.385 --> 26:24.818
Now for the higher
functions.

26:27.285 --> 26:29.585
Uh-oh.
- What?

26:29.651 --> 26:32.585
- Her main board overheated
and melted some circuits.

26:43.508 --> 26:45.341
I've never seen
anything like this before.

26:46.523 --> 26:48.923
- I'm sorry, Mom.
I know you like her.

26:49.023 --> 26:50.657
I was just joking
about returning her.

26:50.757 --> 26:52.490
Can you fix her?

26:52.590 --> 26:55.448
- Well, it looks like
she's fixed herself.

26:55.573 --> 26:58.034
She's different now...
Not the way I made her.

26:58.089 --> 27:01.056
When the circuits cooled,
they formed new pathways.

27:01.223 --> 27:03.123
- So, what does
that mean?

27:03.223 --> 27:06.323
- I don't know.
Maybe nothing.

27:06.423 --> 27:08.589
Maybe it will
change her.

27:08.689 --> 27:10.223
- Change her how?

27:10.256 --> 27:12.823
- Uh... I'm not sure.

27:12.923 --> 27:14.523
We'll have to
wait and see.

27:14.623 --> 27:16.323
- So, in the meantime...
- Eeeee!

27:16.423 --> 27:18.689
- ... we'll keep
a close eye on her.

27:18.789 --> 27:22.223
Well, she still likes you.
That's a good sign.

27:22.289 --> 27:24.489
- Get her off of me.

27:24.589 --> 27:26.789
- Aw, isn't having
a sister great?

27:33.423 --> 27:35.089
It's a bit
of a tight squeeze.

27:35.223 --> 27:37.256
I don't see how
Santa Claus does it.

27:39.223 --> 27:41.056
I'm in.
Commencing search.

27:41.223 --> 27:42.223
- What... what do you see?

27:42.289 --> 27:44.223
- The Gaines' home
is vacant,

27:44.323 --> 27:46.223
and it looks like
they left in a rush.

27:46.256 --> 27:47.923
- Oh, I was afraid of that.

27:48.023 --> 27:49.456
- May I return to EGG?

27:49.556 --> 27:51.356
- No, no, you stay there
and search for anything

27:51.456 --> 27:53.223
that can help us
find them.

27:53.323 --> 27:55.323
I need that android.

27:55.423 --> 27:57.323
- Must I?

27:57.423 --> 28:00.689
What's the matter, PEGSI?

28:00.789 --> 28:02.323
You're not scared,
are you?

28:02.423 --> 28:04.889
- Mr. Kingston,
I'm a machine designed

28:04.989 --> 28:07.256
to execute tasks
with speed and precision.

28:07.356 --> 28:09.723
I don't get "scared."

28:09.823 --> 28:11.289
Okay, I'm a little scared.

28:18.056 --> 28:18.989
- Is your mom home?

28:19.089 --> 28:21.556
- Uh, hello to you, too.

28:22.260 --> 28:23.327
Mom!

28:23.455 --> 28:24.921
- Oh, hi, James.

28:25.077 --> 28:26.056
We're just about to
sit down for dinner,

28:26.223 --> 28:27.223
but why don't you join us?

28:27.289 --> 28:29.089
- Oh, I'd love to.

28:30.356 --> 28:32.389
- Oh, hey, James.
How are you doing?

28:32.489 --> 28:35.456
I'll just set
another place for...

28:35.556 --> 28:36.689
for me, I guess.

28:36.789 --> 28:39.289
- So, what's going on?

28:39.389 --> 28:42.023
- I heard from
a contact at EGG,

28:42.123 --> 28:44.089
Kingston is on
the war path.

28:44.223 --> 28:45.389
He's got a whole team

28:45.489 --> 28:47.289
trying to track down
you and Frankie.

28:47.389 --> 28:49.489
- Uh, Mom?
- Not now.

28:49.589 --> 28:51.489
I mean, that's not
a surprise.

28:51.589 --> 28:53.223
- Mom?
- Just lay low, okay?

28:53.323 --> 28:56.089
- Mom!
- Frankie, no!

28:56.223 --> 28:57.589
You know you can't eat.

28:57.689 --> 28:59.789
You have no digestive
mechanisms.

28:59.889 --> 29:01.223
Why did you do that?

29:01.256 --> 29:02.589
- She was imitating
Mr. Peters.

29:02.689 --> 29:04.689
- What do you mean
imitating me?

29:07.423 --> 29:08.723
I don't eat like that.

29:08.823 --> 29:10.856
- She was?
That's peculiar.

29:10.956 --> 29:14.689
Could she be... no, no,
that's... that's impossible.

29:14.789 --> 29:15.923
- What?

29:16.023 --> 29:17.356
- Well, it's called
"mirroring."

29:17.456 --> 29:19.023
It's one of the first
social developments

29:19.123 --> 29:20.989
human babies exhibit.

29:21.089 --> 29:23.656
- Ha! So, Frankie's
like a giant baby?

29:23.756 --> 29:26.223
- Is it possible
that she's developing

29:26.323 --> 29:28.323
human emotional traits?

29:28.423 --> 29:30.456
- It sounds more like
a code glitch to me.

29:30.556 --> 29:32.389
- Yeah, you're
probably right.

29:32.489 --> 29:35.989
- All right. Now we're
ready to eat.

29:36.089 --> 29:39.223
Looks like microwave
pizza, it is.

29:41.023 --> 29:42.023
- Be right back.

29:42.123 --> 29:44.956
I just need to use
your facilities.

29:45.056 --> 29:46.323
- What kind of
facilities?

29:46.423 --> 29:48.423
Government? Medical?
Educational?

29:48.523 --> 29:50.556
- He's just using a fancy
term for "bathroom."

29:50.656 --> 29:53.756
- Ah, I will file that word
under category "bathroom,"

29:53.856 --> 29:54.989
subcategory "fancy."

29:55.089 --> 29:56.989
- Great. Now that we've
all discussed in detail

29:57.089 --> 29:58.623
where I'm going...

29:58.723 --> 30:00.189
excuse me.

30:17.989 --> 30:19.689
Don't worry, Sigourney,

30:19.789 --> 30:23.889
I promise I'll use all your
research for a good cause...

30:28.056 --> 30:30.756
...helping me win
the Robel Prize.

30:44.389 --> 30:46.323
- Will, would you mind
doing the dishes tonight?

30:46.423 --> 30:48.556
I have some work
I have to finish up.

30:48.656 --> 30:49.923
- Not a problem.

30:50.023 --> 30:52.389
I don't even have
to wash my plate.

30:52.489 --> 30:54.356
The perks of frozen pizza.

30:55.589 --> 30:57.323
- It sure was nice
of Mr. Peters

30:57.423 --> 30:58.989
to do what he does for us.

30:59.089 --> 31:01.256
- I know.
He's a good friend.

31:01.356 --> 31:02.589
- Why did he leave EGG?

31:02.689 --> 31:05.223
- Oh, he and Mr. Kingston
just couldn't get along.

31:05.256 --> 31:07.089
I remember this one time,

31:07.223 --> 31:08.423
Kingston really
gave it to him,

31:08.523 --> 31:10.689
after he caught James
stealing toilet paper

31:10.789 --> 31:12.756
from the employee lavatory.
- JENNY:

31:12.856 --> 31:14.856
- "Lavatory." Another
term for "bathroom."

31:14.956 --> 31:16.056
Also, "washroom,"
"restroom,"

31:16.223 --> 31:17.723
"water closet," "latrine,"

31:17.823 --> 31:19.723
"commode," "outhouse,"
and "john."

31:19.823 --> 31:22.289
Oh, and "facilities."
- JENNY:

31:31.923 --> 31:33.856
Yes!

31:33.956 --> 31:35.589
It's working!

31:35.689 --> 31:38.856
All of that beautiful data
will soon be mine...

31:38.956 --> 31:41.089
and yours, my boy.

31:48.323 --> 31:50.556
- And then we get
rid of Frankie.

31:57.689 --> 32:01.089
- Agenda Item 1.
- Starting in five minutes.

32:01.223 --> 32:02.956
AP Math.

32:05.689 --> 32:07.089
Room 147.

32:07.223 --> 32:08.289
- Hi.

32:08.389 --> 32:10.023
How's my umbrella doing?

32:10.123 --> 32:11.423
- Umbrellas are
inanimate objects

32:11.523 --> 32:12.623
that cannot communicate.

32:12.723 --> 32:15.223
Thus, I cannot tell you
how it is doing.

32:15.323 --> 32:17.023
I guess you're right.

32:17.123 --> 32:18.223
You got me there.

32:18.289 --> 32:19.689
We haven't been
introduced.

32:19.789 --> 32:20.856
I'm Cole.

32:20.956 --> 32:22.323
- There are three Coles
at Sepulveda High...

32:22.423 --> 32:24.489
Cole Mason, Cole Presejian,
and Cole Reyes.

32:24.589 --> 32:26.256
Which Cole are you?

32:26.356 --> 32:28.756
- Cole Reyes.

32:28.856 --> 32:31.456
- Cole Reyes.
Brother of Dayton Reyes.

32:31.556 --> 32:33.789
211 South Sycamore Avenue.

32:33.889 --> 32:35.256
- Uh, right.

32:35.356 --> 32:36.789
And you are?

32:36.889 --> 32:38.523
- I am Frankie.

32:38.623 --> 32:40.956
- Well, it's... it's
nice to meet you, Frankie.

32:43.556 --> 32:46.956
Well, I should... go.
Sorry.

32:47.056 --> 32:48.256
- Goodbye, Cole Reyes.

32:48.356 --> 32:50.823
It was nice to see you.

32:50.923 --> 32:53.123
- Hey, Frankie, uh...

32:53.223 --> 32:54.523
do you maybe wanna...

32:54.623 --> 32:56.223
eat lunch with
me today?

32:56.256 --> 32:57.856
- I don't eat lunch.

32:57.956 --> 33:00.123
But I could sit next to
you and watch you eat.

33:00.223 --> 33:01.256
- You could?

33:01.356 --> 33:02.956
I mean, you'd wanna
do that?

33:03.056 --> 33:04.323
I mean, that's great.

33:04.423 --> 33:06.223
I'll see you
at lunch time.

33:09.989 --> 33:13.556
- Okay, so, you're all familiar
with a spelling bee, huh?

33:13.656 --> 33:16.989
Okay, well, this competition,
follows the same format

33:17.089 --> 33:19.456
except with math.

33:19.556 --> 33:21.523
Get a question right,
you stay in.

33:21.623 --> 33:24.056
Get it wrong,
ya sit down.

33:24.223 --> 33:25.456
Any questions?

33:25.556 --> 33:28.889
Any questions about the math bee
and only the math bee?

33:28.989 --> 33:30.289
Let's start with...

33:30.389 --> 33:31.556
Frankie.

33:31.656 --> 33:33.823
What is the measure of
the interior angles

33:33.923 --> 33:35.223
of a regular decagon?

33:35.256 --> 33:36.856
- One hundred
forty-four degrees.

33:36.956 --> 33:38.423
- Correct.

33:38.523 --> 33:41.356
Tammy. Ten. Zero. Thirteen.
Negative three.

33:41.456 --> 33:43.223
Sixteen. Negative six.

33:43.323 --> 33:44.923
What's the next number
in the sequence?

33:45.023 --> 33:46.323
- Duh. Nineteen.

33:46.423 --> 33:48.223
- Correct.

34:09.956 --> 34:12.255
- Well, it looks
like we have a tie.

34:12.356 --> 34:14.289
Congratulations...

34:14.389 --> 34:16.123
No one's leaving.

34:16.223 --> 34:17.755
We settle this
here and now.

34:17.856 --> 34:19.523
- Yeah, I have another
class coming in...

34:19.623 --> 34:21.223
- A tie-breaker.

34:23.089 --> 34:25.089
- All right.

34:25.223 --> 34:28.755
When you divide a circle's
circumference by its diameter,

34:28.856 --> 34:32.023
you get...
- The number pi! I win!

34:32.123 --> 34:33.688
- I'm not done.

34:33.789 --> 34:38.589
Pi is not an exact number.

34:38.688 --> 34:40.456
Your tie-breaking
challenge...

34:40.556 --> 34:42.856
Whoever writes out pi
to the most digits,

34:42.956 --> 34:45.656
when the next
bell rings, wins.

34:45.755 --> 34:48.956
- Yes, I eat "pi"
for breakfast.

34:49.056 --> 34:50.989
Let's go.

34:51.089 --> 34:52.422
- Begin!

35:05.589 --> 35:07.423
Top this.

35:12.523 --> 35:15.089
- Well, she has to have
messed up somewhere.

35:15.223 --> 35:17.789
- Hold on, my eyes
are starting to cross,

35:17.889 --> 35:19.223
but it's...

35:19.289 --> 35:21.223
it's all correct.

35:21.256 --> 35:22.689
Frankie wins!
Congratulations!

35:22.789 --> 35:25.089
- Yes! Go, Frankie!

35:25.223 --> 35:26.789
- Oh, and congratulations
to you, too, Tammy.

35:26.889 --> 35:28.489
You beat your previous
personal pi record.

35:28.589 --> 35:30.223
Save it!

35:35.223 --> 35:36.856
Nice job.

35:43.805 --> 35:46.272
That was awesome,

35:46.358 --> 35:48.813
and beating Tammy, oh,
that must have felt good.

35:49.040 --> 35:50.840
- I'm not sure
how that felt.

35:50.940 --> 35:52.440
- Well, it made
me feel good.

35:52.540 --> 35:54.506
Man, you're good
at math.

35:54.606 --> 35:57.573
- I'm not a man,
I'm an adolescent female.

35:57.673 --> 35:58.440
- Huh?

35:58.540 --> 36:00.240
Oh?
Oh, good one.

36:00.340 --> 36:01.473
- But thank you
for the compliment.

36:01.573 --> 36:02.973
I have a compliment
for you.

36:03.073 --> 36:04.206
- Oh, no, you don't...

36:04.306 --> 36:05.973
- You are the nicest
person I have ever met.

36:06.073 --> 36:07.840
- Really?

36:09.106 --> 36:11.306
I think we're gonna be great
friends, Frankie Gaines.

36:11.406 --> 36:13.973
- I think we are, too,
Dayton Reyes.

36:14.073 --> 36:16.140
- Wow, you're
a super-strong hugger.

36:17.640 --> 36:19.373
Hey, uh, I've been
thinking.

36:19.473 --> 36:21.373
Do you maybe wanna hang
out after school?

36:21.473 --> 36:24.906
I'm working on my solar-powered
motorized skateboard,

36:25.006 --> 36:27.673
and I could use a brain like
yours to do some calculations.

36:27.840 --> 36:30.006
- Yes, I would love
to help you with that.

36:30.106 --> 36:31.640
- Great!

36:31.740 --> 36:34.373
I still can't believe how far
you went on writing out pi.

36:34.473 --> 36:36.906
Is math, like,
in your DNA or something?

36:37.006 --> 36:38.940
- Yes, you could
say that.

36:43.306 --> 36:45.906
- Tammy, are you okay?

36:46.006 --> 36:48.206
- Of course. I'm fine.

36:48.306 --> 36:49.240
Why do you ask?

36:49.340 --> 36:51.840
- Your face is all...

36:51.940 --> 36:53.006
- Gorgeous!

36:53.106 --> 36:55.040
And perfectly symmetrical.

36:55.140 --> 36:58.173
Research has shown that people
consider facial symmetry

36:58.273 --> 37:00.373
to be an indicator
of beauty, health,

37:00.473 --> 37:02.273
and genetic fitness.

37:02.373 --> 37:04.373
- I was gonna say
it was splotchy.

37:04.473 --> 37:07.340
- It's a result of
venous dilation.

37:07.440 --> 37:09.906
Let's measure
your blood pressure.

37:11.006 --> 37:13.106
- Get that thing
away from me.

37:13.206 --> 37:14.306
- Why are you so mad?

37:14.406 --> 37:16.140
'Cause you lost
the math bee?

37:16.240 --> 37:20.306
- I didn't lose the bee.
It was stolen from me.

37:20.406 --> 37:22.440
The new girl obviously
cheated me.

37:22.540 --> 37:24.206
There's no way
she could have memorized

37:24.306 --> 37:25.640
that many numbers.

37:25.740 --> 37:28.173
- Here come
the blotches again.

37:31.473 --> 37:34.206
There's something
funky about that Frankie...

37:34.306 --> 37:36.973
And I'm gonna find
out what.

37:39.716 --> 37:41.316
- You sure you don't
wanna eat something?

37:41.372 --> 37:42.905
You need fuel to
keep your energy up.

37:43.005 --> 37:44.639
- No, thank you.
I recharge all night.

37:44.672 --> 37:46.205
- All night?
What do you eat?

37:46.305 --> 37:48.139
- Power.
- Power?

37:48.239 --> 37:49.705
Is that some kind
of protein bar?

37:49.805 --> 37:52.139
And you eat 'em all night?
How much can you eat?

37:52.239 --> 37:54.839
- Approximately
10 gigawatts an hour.

37:54.939 --> 37:58.072
- I wouldn't mind trying them.
Maybe you could hook me up.

37:58.172 --> 38:00.139
- I could hook you up
to my power source.

38:00.239 --> 38:02.039
But I think you'd find
the experience unpleasant.

38:03.672 --> 38:05.672
You're kind of an odd duck,
Frankie Gaines, you know that?

38:05.772 --> 38:08.639
- I've been mistaken for both
a man and a duck today.

38:08.739 --> 38:11.772
But I'm an adolescent female.
- COLE:

38:12.672 --> 38:14.339
- Hey.
- Hello, Dayton Reyes.

38:14.439 --> 38:15.905
Hello, Byron Patrick.

38:16.005 --> 38:18.539
- I'm surprised my new friend
already knows my brother.

38:18.639 --> 38:20.672
- I'm surprised my new friend
already knows my sister.

38:20.772 --> 38:22.372
- I'm surprised no
one at this table,

38:22.472 --> 38:24.272
is interested in me
in the slightest.

38:24.372 --> 38:25.939
- Repetition
is a comic device.

38:26.039 --> 38:28.072
Ha, ha, ha, I get it.

38:30.005 --> 38:32.739
Isn't Frankie hilarious?

38:38.072 --> 38:39.939
- You should have
seen Tammy's face

38:40.039 --> 38:41.205
when she lost
the math bee.

38:41.305 --> 38:42.839
She was all...

38:42.939 --> 38:44.072
BYRON & COLE:

38:44.172 --> 38:45.372
- Everybody's
talking about it.

38:45.472 --> 38:47.939
- Everybody's talking
about what?

38:50.239 --> 38:52.072
- Climate change?

38:55.305 --> 38:58.539
Incoming
video call from Dr. Mom.

38:59.739 --> 39:02.139
- What's with you?

39:02.239 --> 39:03.872
- I'm getting a call
from Dr. Mom.

39:03.972 --> 39:05.005
- Who?

39:05.105 --> 39:06.405
- And your phone...

39:06.505 --> 39:08.105
do you have some
kind of ringtone

39:08.205 --> 39:09.272
that only dogs can hear?

39:09.372 --> 39:10.639
Are you a dog?

39:10.705 --> 39:14.372
- I am not a dog,
nor a man, nor a duck.

39:14.472 --> 39:16.539
- Okay, what is she
even talking about?

39:16.639 --> 39:19.672
Okay, Tammy, chill.

39:19.772 --> 39:20.939
- Hi, Frankie.

39:21.039 --> 39:22.639
Don't say anything if there
are other kids around.

39:22.739 --> 39:24.772
Go somewhere you can be alone.
I'll hold.

39:24.872 --> 39:28.539
- Excuse me. I must go
somewhere to be alone.

39:30.072 --> 39:31.905
- Okay, someone's moody.

39:36.639 --> 39:39.639
Come on, nerds,
give me something I can use.

39:39.705 --> 39:41.305
- What have you got
for me, PEGSI?

39:41.405 --> 39:44.205
I'm afraid
there's nothing yet, sir.

39:44.305 --> 39:46.439
- Well, how can
that be? I...

39:46.539 --> 39:49.605
People don't just vanish
into thin air.

39:49.705 --> 39:52.039
Have you checked all
of their social media accounts?

39:52.139 --> 39:53.805
- Of course.
- They've gone dark.

39:53.905 --> 39:55.605
There have been no charges
on their credit cards,

39:55.705 --> 39:57.305
no calls on their
mobile phones.

39:57.405 --> 39:58.705
- Keep looking... harder.

39:58.805 --> 40:00.839
I don't know
what else we can do.

40:00.939 --> 40:02.039
We've looked everywhere.

40:02.139 --> 40:03.739
- Whose bright idea
was it to build

40:03.839 --> 40:07.005
a whining function into
your system architecture?

40:07.105 --> 40:08.239
It was your idea, sir.

40:08.339 --> 40:09.905
- Well, then he is fired.

40:11.739 --> 40:12.805
Oh.

40:14.239 --> 40:15.705
Where are you going?

40:15.805 --> 40:17.472
It's time for
our backgammon game.

40:17.572 --> 40:19.839
- Oh, no, no, no.
No games for you, PEGSI.

40:19.939 --> 40:22.772
You are going back
to the Gaines' house.

40:22.872 --> 40:26.572
Bring a team of people...
With hands this time.

40:26.672 --> 40:28.939
And you stay there until
you find something we can use

40:29.039 --> 40:30.605
to track down my property.

40:30.705 --> 40:32.305
I've been thinking.

40:32.405 --> 40:34.205
Maybe we could just
let this one go.

40:34.305 --> 40:37.539
Dr. Gaines' android was
a bit erratic, after all.

40:37.639 --> 40:40.172
- That's not our
problem, PEGSI.

40:40.272 --> 40:43.105
I promised them
an android, and I...

40:43.205 --> 40:44.605
I intend to deliver.

40:44.705 --> 40:46.439
They're just going to
turn it into a mindless

40:46.539 --> 40:48.639
weapon of mass
destruction anyway,

40:48.739 --> 40:50.639
so, the only thing
they care about

40:50.672 --> 40:53.272
is that it is functional.

40:53.372 --> 40:54.905
Find it.

40:57.205 --> 40:59.639
Have this door
removed... immediately.

41:09.505 --> 41:11.072
- I'm alone now.

41:11.172 --> 41:12.905
- Good. Your upgrade
is ready.

41:13.005 --> 41:14.505
- Thank you, Dr. Mom.

41:14.639 --> 41:16.305
Should we perform installation
tonight before charging?

41:16.405 --> 41:18.639
- Not this time.
While I was coding it,

41:18.739 --> 41:20.539
I found a bug in
your current operating system

41:20.639 --> 41:23.372
that could knock out your
accelerometers and gyros.

41:23.472 --> 41:24.872
- That would be suboptimal.

41:24.972 --> 41:27.272
I would not be able
to walk or even stand.

41:27.372 --> 41:29.272
- Exactly. I need you
to download the patch now.

41:29.372 --> 41:30.639
Can you do that?

41:30.739 --> 41:31.772
- Affirmative.

41:31.872 --> 41:35.139
- Humans say "yes"
or "uh-huh." Remember?

41:35.239 --> 41:37.372
- Yes or uh-huh.

41:37.472 --> 41:40.439
- Well, we can
work on that later.

41:40.539 --> 41:41.805
I'm sending you the file.

41:41.905 --> 41:43.905
Let me know when you've
installed it, okay?

41:44.005 --> 41:45.239
Yes or uh-huh.

41:45.339 --> 41:47.039
I'm ready, Dr. Mom.

41:47.139 --> 41:49.505
- One more thing.

41:49.639 --> 41:52.039
Just call me "Mom."

41:52.139 --> 41:54.839
- Mom.

41:56.372 --> 41:58.039
- Initiating data transfer.

42:02.239 --> 42:04.639
- List of countries with
faster internet connections

42:04.739 --> 42:06.772
than the United States:

42:06.872 --> 42:10.539
South Korea, Sweden, Norway,
Japan, the Netherlands,

42:10.639 --> 42:12.972
Hong Kong, Latvia,
Switzerland.

42:15.639 --> 42:18.405
- I need a stable
internet connection.

42:20.005 --> 42:21.972
- Hello, Dayton Reyes.
- Hi.

42:22.072 --> 42:23.472
Is everything all right?

42:23.639 --> 42:24.672
- Yes or uh-huh.

42:24.772 --> 42:26.639
- Where are you
rushing off to?

42:26.672 --> 42:29.105
second
floor, room 216, east corridor.

42:29.205 --> 42:31.439
- Yep, that's where
the computer lab is, all right.

42:31.539 --> 42:35.172
Wait, I wanted to see
if you wanted to...

42:35.272 --> 42:36.805
Or not?

42:53.172 --> 42:54.639
- Hey, Frankie.

42:54.739 --> 42:56.505
Why are you
sitting in the dark?

42:56.639 --> 42:58.439
- No additional
light was necessary.

42:58.539 --> 42:59.639
- What are you doing?

42:59.672 --> 43:01.005
- Downloading a large file.

43:01.105 --> 43:02.939
Do not reveal android status.

43:08.672 --> 43:10.972
- What was that cable
plugged into?

43:13.339 --> 43:15.172
Do not lie.

43:26.039 --> 43:27.872
- What... what are you?
