♪

00:05.005 --> 00:08.051
Please, I don't want
to see those men again.

00:08.095 --> 00:09.226
I understand...They said they'd kill me

00:09.270 --> 00:10.488
if I ever talked
about what happened.

00:10.532 --> 00:12.229
That's not going to happen...She said no.

00:12.273 --> 00:14.275
If you'll just hear me out,
Mr. Hill...

00:14.318 --> 00:16.103
I-I've heard enough;
she's 16 years old

00:16.146 --> 00:18.409
and she's been through hell.

00:18.453 --> 00:19.802
I'm taking her back to Chicago.

00:19.845 --> 00:22.500
I know it's difficult...She's not testifying.

00:29.203 --> 00:31.161
I don't blame her old man
for being pissed.

00:31.205 --> 00:34.208
The sex trafficking laws say
the victims must appear in court

00:34.251 --> 00:36.340
to prove they were coerced
by the defendants.

00:36.384 --> 00:37.472
That's crazy.

00:37.515 --> 00:40.170
47 other states agree with you.

00:40.214 --> 00:41.824
Check out the other victims?

00:41.867 --> 00:43.260
Yeah, they're in
even worse shape.

00:43.304 --> 00:45.915
This girl's our best shot.

00:45.958 --> 00:47.830
Run the case again.

00:47.873 --> 00:50.180
These animals aren't gonna walk.

01:02.366 --> 01:04.151
Come on.

01:07.197 --> 01:09.112
Okay.

01:09.156 --> 01:10.722
Deal's done. We got our guy.

01:10.766 --> 01:11.723
Let's pick him up.

01:11.767 --> 01:13.073
We got company.

01:13.116 --> 01:14.857
It looks like
one of ours.

01:16.380 --> 01:17.773
You got a second
for me, detectives?

01:17.816 --> 01:20.602
Tommy, what the hell
are you doing here?

01:20.645 --> 01:22.386
That's what we need
to talk about.

01:22.430 --> 01:23.605
Right.

01:25.433 --> 01:28.392
What the hell
did we step in this time?

01:30.177 --> 01:32.483
You look like hell.
You getting any sleep?

01:32.527 --> 01:34.137
That's what I get
for having a kid at my age.

01:34.181 --> 01:36.183
Detective Tommy Pierce,
my partner,

01:36.226 --> 01:37.488
Detective Maria Baez.

01:37.532 --> 01:39.142
Tommy works for
the Organized Crime Task Force.

01:39.186 --> 01:42.276
Which doesn't explain why
we're letting our suspect flee.

01:42.319 --> 01:43.625
Your suspect just
did business with

01:43.668 --> 01:45.801
the Lion's Head drug cartel.Which explains why

01:45.844 --> 01:48.934
the Organized Crime Task Force
is interested in our suspect.

01:48.978 --> 01:49.935
Been building the case
for months,

01:49.979 --> 01:51.154
we're about to make our move.

01:51.198 --> 01:52.808
And you don't want us
to scare him off.

01:52.851 --> 01:55.027
I can give you my word that
once we take down the cartel,

01:55.071 --> 01:56.116
we'll make sure
that you have everything

01:56.159 --> 01:57.204
you need to make your collar.

01:57.247 --> 01:59.684
Really?
Really.

01:59.728 --> 02:02.122
Well, then we only got
one question.Shoot.

02:02.165 --> 02:04.167
Do you need two extra bodies
for the takedown?

02:04.211 --> 02:06.909
I think I can make that happen.

02:06.952 --> 02:08.258
Okay.

02:13.611 --> 02:14.786
Told you you weren't
gonna like it.

02:14.830 --> 02:16.310
Why were we out
of the loop?

02:16.353 --> 02:18.181
They didn't come up with this
over breakfast this morning.

02:18.225 --> 02:20.314
Chief Assistant D.A. said
it was an oversight.

02:20.357 --> 02:21.358
Coming out of the bathroom

02:21.402 --> 02:23.230
with your fly down
is an oversight.

02:23.273 --> 02:25.188
Declaring the D.A.'s office
will no longer

02:25.232 --> 02:27.973
prosecute marijuana laws?

02:28.017 --> 02:29.627
That's a shot across the bow.

02:29.671 --> 02:32.239
To be fair, Brooklyn D.A.'s been
operating under the same policy.

02:32.282 --> 02:35.764
I don't care. Marijuana laws
are still on the books.

02:35.807 --> 02:38.114
But if the law's antiquated...Change the law.

02:38.158 --> 02:41.248
His statement
also recommends legalizing

02:41.291 --> 02:43.511
the possession of marijuana.

02:43.554 --> 02:47.384
So, if I'm walking down
the street smoking a cigar,

02:47.428 --> 02:49.647
I get a summons,
but if I'm smoking a joint,

02:49.691 --> 02:51.736
I'm cool.

02:51.780 --> 02:54.609
I get what you're saying, boss,
but if the D.A. won't prosecute

02:54.652 --> 02:57.525
pot cases, why waste
our guys' time making arrests?

02:57.568 --> 03:01.268
Because we choose to do
the job we were hired for.

03:01.311 --> 03:03.270
I'm real comfortable with that.

03:04.619 --> 03:07.056
Set up a meeting
with the D.A. forthwith.

03:08.840 --> 03:10.320
You sure you don't want
to take a beat?

03:10.364 --> 03:11.452
Maybe cool down a little?

03:11.495 --> 03:13.628
Forthwith.

03:22.506 --> 03:23.594
Ramos!

03:23.638 --> 03:25.814
We got a guy with a gun
in the bodega!

03:25.857 --> 03:27.642
Six to eight civilians
trapped inside.

03:27.685 --> 03:30.035
Everybody stay back,
clear the area!

03:30.079 --> 03:31.559

On their way!

03:33.343 --> 03:34.910
Back off!

03:34.953 --> 03:37.434

03:43.788 --> 03:44.920

Copy that.

Officer shot at this location.

04:15.211 --> 04:16.430
PERP:
Come on, get off me.

04:16.473 --> 04:17.866
Ah, my wrists.

04:17.909 --> 04:19.607
Keep him there.
I'll call a bus.

04:19.650 --> 04:21.435
PERP:
Get off me.

04:21.478 --> 04:23.524
Ramos. Ramos, how you doing?

04:23.567 --> 04:25.830
We got, we got him, boss.Okay.

04:25.874 --> 04:27.789
St. Benjamin's three blocks
away. Let's get him in the car.

04:27.832 --> 04:29.399
Here we go, keep
pressure on it.

04:34.883 --> 04:37.973
♪

05:06.610 --> 05:08.786
Hey.
You okay?

05:08.830 --> 05:10.571
Not the one who got shot.

05:10.614 --> 05:12.660
I talked to Ramos' partner.

05:12.703 --> 05:14.314
He said you made the right call.

05:14.357 --> 05:15.706
I sure hope so.

05:15.750 --> 05:17.708
You had to send them in, Jamie.

05:17.752 --> 05:19.144
Could have waited
for ESU to show up.

05:19.188 --> 05:20.537
Shooter had hostages, right?

05:20.581 --> 05:21.843
All alive and unharmed
at the time.

05:21.886 --> 05:24.106
Don't do that.Do what?

05:24.149 --> 05:26.151
Armchair quarterback yourself.

05:26.195 --> 05:27.283
You did the right thing.

05:27.327 --> 05:29.459
Tell that to Ramos.

05:34.725 --> 05:36.466
We're in a tough spot with

05:36.510 --> 05:38.555
your sex trafficking case.Tell me about it.

05:38.599 --> 05:40.688
Without Tonya Hill's
testimony, we can't prove

05:40.731 --> 05:43.430
that she was coerced
into prostitution.

05:43.473 --> 05:44.822
A law that makes no damn sense.

05:44.866 --> 05:47.303
I agree, but the new legislation
that would change

05:47.347 --> 05:49.740
the standard is stuck
in Albany politics.

05:49.784 --> 05:51.829
You should see what they did
to these girls, Erin.

05:51.873 --> 05:53.527
Locked up in apartments
for months.

05:53.570 --> 05:54.789
Turning ten
tricks a day.

05:54.832 --> 05:57.269
Which is why we need
Tonya to take the stand.

05:57.313 --> 05:59.663
So we, what, serve a subpoena
on a traumatized girl?

05:59.707 --> 06:02.623
So she can go relive her
nightmare in open court?

06:02.666 --> 06:06.148
Forcing reluctant victims
to testify feels lousy,

06:06.191 --> 06:08.933
but letting the bad guys
go free feels even worse.

06:10.761 --> 06:13.677
I'll tell you what--
you get Tonya to testify

06:13.721 --> 06:16.811
and I will ask the D.A. to lobby
the governor to sign

06:16.854 --> 06:18.813
the new sex trafficking law.

06:18.856 --> 06:20.858
That way, we won't have to go
through this nightmare again.

06:22.773 --> 06:24.775
It's the best we can do.

06:30.564 --> 06:31.913
Hey.

06:31.956 --> 06:34.176
Heard Tonya Hill's father

06:34.219 --> 06:35.830
hired a lawyer
to fight the subpoena.

06:35.873 --> 06:37.571
Ugh, yeah, she's
scared to death,

06:37.614 --> 06:39.616
so I don't blame him.What are you gonna do?

06:39.660 --> 06:42.706
I'm going to ask
the judge for an adjournment

06:42.750 --> 06:44.491
to try to buy ourselves
some more time.

06:44.534 --> 06:47.624
Did you see the D.A. about
the new sex trafficking law?

06:47.668 --> 06:49.234
Yeah, and he agreed
it's long overdue.

06:49.278 --> 06:50.671
That's good.

06:50.714 --> 06:52.847
He also agreed that Governor
Mendez is the only one

06:52.890 --> 06:53.848
who can get it done.

06:53.891 --> 06:56.416
So he's gonna
make a call.
No.

06:56.459 --> 06:58.679
Why the hell not?Apparently, he and Mendez

06:58.722 --> 07:00.202
are not on speaking terms.

07:00.245 --> 07:02.422
Oh, here we go.Chatwal came out

07:02.465 --> 07:04.119
against his
sentencing law

07:04.162 --> 07:06.121
that the governor had
sponsored last year.

07:06.164 --> 07:08.993
We're talking about young girls
here; let's get over it.

07:09.037 --> 07:11.866
Apparently, he is not a
"get over it" kind of guy.

07:11.909 --> 07:13.650
So that's it?
The law's dead in the water?

07:13.694 --> 07:16.871
Not exactly.
Chatwal chose someone else

07:16.914 --> 07:17.741
to lobby the governor.

07:17.785 --> 07:20.004
Who's that?Me.

07:20.048 --> 07:23.747
He said, as Trial Bureau
Chief, I supervise the cases

07:23.791 --> 07:25.749
impacted by the
current law.

07:25.793 --> 07:27.621
Yeah, well, he's got
a point there.

07:27.664 --> 07:28.796
You can do this.

07:28.839 --> 07:30.232
You think?

07:30.275 --> 07:33.931
I have no idea; I'm just trying
to be supportive.

07:35.716 --> 07:37.848
Thanks.

07:37.892 --> 07:39.720
We've identified a sit-down
that will put

07:39.763 --> 07:41.548
all the Lion's Head bosses
in the same place.

07:41.591 --> 07:42.897
One-stop shopping.

07:42.940 --> 07:44.246
Then we can charge
them under the RICO Act

07:44.289 --> 07:45.769
with conspiracy.
Exactly.

07:45.813 --> 07:47.771
We do this right,
we'll cripple their operation.

07:47.815 --> 07:49.556
Team leader will
break down the details.

07:49.599 --> 07:50.644
Save me a seat, okay?

07:50.687 --> 07:53.124
How's Val and the baby?

07:53.168 --> 07:55.213
Have a look?

07:55.257 --> 07:57.868
Wow.

07:57.912 --> 07:58.695
Look at that smile.
Yeah.

07:58.739 --> 08:00.305
She's getting so big.

08:00.349 --> 08:01.785
Yeah, you haven't seen her
since the christening.

08:01.829 --> 08:03.700
Yeah.
Meant a lot to
us, having you

08:03.744 --> 08:04.832
and the boys there.

08:04.875 --> 08:06.529
Come on, after all
you guys went through

08:06.573 --> 08:07.965
to have her in your life,
how could we miss it?

08:08.009 --> 08:09.314
I'll be digging out
from under those

08:09.358 --> 08:10.664
fertility bills till
this one's driving.

08:10.707 --> 08:11.534
Yeah, but it's worth it.

08:11.578 --> 08:13.057
Yeah, in spades.
Yep.

08:13.101 --> 08:14.363
How are the boys
doing

08:14.406 --> 08:17.018
Yeah, they're,
they're adjusting.
Yeah.

08:17.061 --> 08:18.976
It helps that Val
stays in touch, you know?

08:19.020 --> 08:21.022
Means a lot to them.
Yeah.

08:21.065 --> 08:23.590
You're a lucky man.Thanks, Danny.

08:23.633 --> 08:25.983
Sir, ADA Reagan is here.

08:30.379 --> 08:32.033
ADA Reagan is here?

08:34.949 --> 08:37.778
Let's have her.

08:43.131 --> 08:44.175
Good afternoon.

08:44.219 --> 08:46.177
How many times
that son of a bitch

08:46.221 --> 08:48.789
gonna send you to take his heat?

08:48.832 --> 08:51.139
You mean the district attorney?

08:51.182 --> 08:54.751
Yeah. If he's gonna pursue this
ridiculous marijuana policy,

08:54.795 --> 08:57.580
he ought to have the balls
to show up himself.

08:57.624 --> 09:01.584
Well, in that case, the right
son of a bitch is here.

09:01.628 --> 09:04.587
It's my policy, not his.

09:09.374 --> 09:13.422
Remind me to bring the
penal code to dinner on Sunday.

09:13.465 --> 09:16.164
I am sure you think
it's misguided.

09:16.207 --> 09:18.035
I don't think; I know.

09:18.079 --> 09:21.125
But eliminating marijuana
possession cases

09:21.169 --> 09:25.042
will relieve a huge
strain on the system.What

09:25.086 --> 09:27.915
No, overwhelmed
by nothing cases.

09:27.958 --> 09:31.179
So the solution is
to undermine cops' morale.

09:31.222 --> 09:33.137
We make arrests
you don't pursue.

09:33.181 --> 09:36.924
In order to free up resources
for more serious crimes.

09:36.967 --> 09:39.187
Boy, there's some
half-assed logic.

09:39.230 --> 09:40.449
Meaning?

09:40.492 --> 09:42.799
Meaning, failing to
prosecute lesser crimes

09:42.843 --> 09:46.586
undermines the rule of law,
encouraging more serious ones.

09:46.629 --> 09:49.153
Erin, if you think
you're overwhelmed now...

09:49.197 --> 09:51.068
I don't think; I know.

09:56.160 --> 09:59.816
A lifetime in police work,
and I missed the wisdom

09:59.860 --> 10:01.513
of letting lawbreakers skate.

10:01.557 --> 10:05.822
Any lifetime includes revisions
and reinventions.

10:05.866 --> 10:08.738
And when they change the law,
we'll change our enforcement.

10:08.782 --> 10:13.264
I was really hoping we would
come to an understanding.

10:13.308 --> 10:17.312
Okay. We'll arrest,
you'll prosecute.

10:17.355 --> 10:19.749
How's that sound?

10:53.870 --> 10:56.656
TOMMY :
All units, on my mark. Three...

10:56.699 --> 10:58.614
two... one.

10:58.658 --> 11:00.050
Mark.

11:05.665 --> 11:07.579
Do not move!Drop your weapons!

11:36.870 --> 11:39.176
OFFICER:
Cover my right!

11:43.659 --> 11:44.616
Clear.

11:44.660 --> 11:45.792
All clear.

11:47.707 --> 11:48.577
Take cover!

11:50.492 --> 11:51.493
Get down!

12:04.201 --> 12:05.550
Tommy.

12:06.943 --> 12:08.162
:
Cover.

12:13.471 --> 12:16.300
I can't see him.
Take the shot.

12:16.344 --> 12:17.998
What the hell
are you doing, Tommy?

12:28.095 --> 12:29.661
Danny!
Yeah!

12:30.662 --> 12:32.229
Officer down.

12:32.273 --> 12:33.535
Damn it.
You okay?

12:33.578 --> 12:35.537
Yeah.
Where the hell
was Tommy?

12:35.580 --> 12:37.582
I don't know.

12:39.019 --> 12:41.282
I don't know what
the hell happened.

12:53.773 --> 12:54.904
Hey.

12:54.948 --> 12:56.166
Hey, Tommy.

12:56.210 --> 12:57.037
What the hell happened
back there?

12:57.080 --> 12:58.125
Is your arm okay?

12:58.168 --> 12:59.648
Yeah, don't worry about my arm.

12:59.691 --> 13:01.302
Why didn't you take the shot
and take out the shooter?

13:01.345 --> 13:02.912
Couldn't be sure there weren't
Task Force members behind him.

13:02.956 --> 13:04.784
There was a Task Force member
about to get taken out.

13:04.827 --> 13:07.003
It was a complicated situation.Complicated how?

13:07.047 --> 13:09.179
I would've been shooting blind.
The cop still had his gun.

13:09.223 --> 13:10.267
He could've taken
the guy out himself.

13:10.311 --> 13:11.529
While he was bleeding out?

13:11.573 --> 13:12.922
Look, I'm sorry you got hurt.

13:12.966 --> 13:16.143
I really am, but this
operation was a success.

13:16.186 --> 13:17.579
I stand
behind my actions.

13:19.842 --> 13:21.104
What do you think?

13:21.148 --> 13:22.584
Look, I know Tommy.

13:22.627 --> 13:24.891
If he stands by his call,
it's good enough for me.

13:24.934 --> 13:27.981
It sounds more like an excuse
than an explanation.

13:28.024 --> 13:30.592
I don't know.

13:32.855 --> 13:35.597
I don't know.

13:44.693 --> 13:46.086
ADA Reagan.

13:46.129 --> 13:48.436
Governor, thank you so much
for making time to see me.

13:48.479 --> 13:50.177
My pleasure. Please.

13:52.179 --> 13:53.093
You hungry?

13:53.136 --> 13:54.877
Tuna tartare
is outstanding.

13:54.921 --> 13:56.270
I'm fine, thank you.

13:56.313 --> 13:58.576
I'm used to doing business
with a different Reagan.

13:58.620 --> 14:00.143
This is definitely
an upgrade.

14:00.187 --> 14:03.103
I know you're busy,
so I'll get right down to it.

14:03.146 --> 14:05.670
I want to discuss the new
sex trafficking law.

14:05.714 --> 14:07.716
I'll save you some time.
I'm all for it.

14:07.759 --> 14:09.283
You are?
Damn right.

14:09.326 --> 14:11.894
Those animals
should rot in jail.

14:11.938 --> 14:14.897
But your real point is: why
haven't I enacted the new law?

14:14.941 --> 14:17.552
Well, yeah, I can't imagine
that sex traffickers

14:17.595 --> 14:19.032
have a powerful lobby.

14:19.075 --> 14:21.686
You are an upgrade.

14:21.730 --> 14:24.080
No. The assembly speaker
opposes it.

14:24.124 --> 14:25.603
On what grounds?

14:25.647 --> 14:27.127
On the grounds that
the bill's attachment

14:27.170 --> 14:29.390
doesn't include funding
for a new bridge

14:29.433 --> 14:31.479
over some river
in his home district,

14:31.522 --> 14:32.915
among other cuts of pork.

14:32.959 --> 14:34.612
Is there a deal to be made?

14:34.656 --> 14:36.527
There's always
a deal to be made.

14:36.571 --> 14:39.400
The trick is making one
you can actually live with.

14:39.443 --> 14:43.230
Young lives are being
destroyed, Governor.

14:43.273 --> 14:44.448
Can you live with that?

14:44.492 --> 14:47.060
It's not that simple.

14:47.103 --> 14:48.583
I understand, but is it fair

14:48.626 --> 14:50.715
that young boys
and girls have to suffer

14:50.759 --> 14:53.283
because of some
bureaucratic dispute?

14:53.327 --> 14:57.592
No, it's not fair,
but it is politics.

15:02.205 --> 15:04.686
GORMLEY:
Weighing pot
on a cop car?

15:04.729 --> 15:06.122
Look at this dirtbag,
will you?

15:06.166 --> 15:07.515
Okay, now I've seen everything.

15:07.558 --> 15:08.864
Where the hell
are the officers?

15:08.908 --> 15:11.084
On their meal
across the street.

15:11.127 --> 15:12.302
Has the boss
seen this yet?

15:12.346 --> 15:13.869
Not that I know of.If I know him...

15:13.913 --> 15:16.959
I want the entire command staff
in my office in one hour.

15:32.018 --> 15:33.367
What's up?Kid flagged us down.

15:33.410 --> 15:34.977
His folks are going at it
pretty good upstairs,

15:35.021 --> 15:36.239
says his old man's got a knife.

15:36.283 --> 15:37.458
Okay.

15:37.501 --> 15:38.894
We'll head upstairs, Sarge.

15:38.938 --> 15:41.157
No, you two stay with the kid.
I'll go in.

15:41.201 --> 15:44.204
But we can handle this.I know you can. Call it in.

15:44.247 --> 15:45.640
At least let us back you up.

15:45.683 --> 15:47.947
Sit tight. I need help,
I'll call for an 85.

15:54.257 --> 15:57.869
The defendants are charged with
sex trafficking, Mr. Richardson.

15:57.913 --> 15:59.393
Yes, Your Honor.

15:59.436 --> 16:01.699
Which requires you to prove
the plaintiffs were forced,

16:01.743 --> 16:04.572
coerced, or defrauded
into performing sex acts

16:04.615 --> 16:06.313
by the accused.

16:06.356 --> 16:08.315
And we are pursuing
that testimony.

16:08.358 --> 16:10.099
May I be heard,
Your Honor?

16:10.143 --> 16:12.101
Court recognizes ADA Reagan.

16:12.145 --> 16:15.322
Thank you, Your Honor.
While we strenuously

16:15.365 --> 16:18.760
take issue with the current
sex trafficking laws,

16:18.803 --> 16:20.327
we will not
argue them here.

16:20.370 --> 16:22.416
That said, requiring
underaged victims

16:22.459 --> 16:24.374
to prove they didn't have

16:24.418 --> 16:26.637
consensual sex with an adult,

16:26.681 --> 16:29.336
when, as minors, they're not
legally qualified to do so...

16:29.379 --> 16:31.642
The court is aware of the
inherent conflict, Ms. Reagan.

16:31.686 --> 16:34.123
The People request
an adjournment in this matter.

16:34.167 --> 16:35.429
To what end?

16:35.472 --> 16:37.170
In order to produce a witness

16:37.213 --> 16:40.129
that is capable of testifying
to the alleged crimes.

16:40.173 --> 16:42.001
The defendants are currently
in custody.

16:42.044 --> 16:44.394
They have a right
to be faced by their accusers

16:44.438 --> 16:46.135
in a timely fashion.Your Honor...

16:46.179 --> 16:47.354
Therefore,
no adjournment

16:47.397 --> 16:48.616
will be granted.

16:48.659 --> 16:49.834
Once a trial
has commenced,

16:49.878 --> 16:51.923
the People must call

16:51.967 --> 16:54.926
the victims to prove
the crimes charged.

16:54.970 --> 16:56.102
If not, I'll be forced

16:56.145 --> 16:59.105
to dismiss the
indictment.

16:59.148 --> 17:01.324
Thank you, Your Honor.

17:15.512 --> 17:17.645
How'd it go with
Infernal Affairs?

17:17.688 --> 17:20.387
We're not the subjects. They're
looking at the cartel raid.

17:20.430 --> 17:22.041
Anything
I should know?

17:22.084 --> 17:23.259
Detective Reagan?

17:36.229 --> 17:38.013
How's the arm?
Fine.

17:38.057 --> 17:40.711
I'm investigating claims that a
certain member of the Task Force

17:40.755 --> 17:43.323
failed to take
proper police action.

17:43.366 --> 17:46.543
Well, the operation
was a success.

17:46.587 --> 17:48.806
The cartel chiefs
are in custody,

17:48.850 --> 17:50.069
and everyone
did their job.

17:50.112 --> 17:52.854
Maybe not everyone.
Several team members say

17:52.897 --> 17:54.682
Detective Pierce
froze under fire.

17:54.725 --> 17:56.075
All hell broke loose.

17:56.118 --> 17:58.033
Tommy was pinned down
just like the rest of us.

17:58.077 --> 17:59.600
But unlike Pierce,

17:59.643 --> 18:02.211
you managed to come to the aid
of your fellow officer.

18:02.255 --> 18:04.605
I was in the right place
at the right time.

18:04.648 --> 18:07.303
From what I'm told,

18:07.347 --> 18:09.436
the injured officer was here.

18:09.479 --> 18:11.916
You were here.
Detective Pierce was here.

18:11.960 --> 18:13.483
Pierce clearly had
a clearer path

18:13.527 --> 18:15.529
to the shooter than you did.

18:15.572 --> 18:19.315
Look, there are hundreds
of variables in any firefight

18:19.359 --> 18:23.580
that you can't really define
in some drawing, okay?

18:23.624 --> 18:26.453
Okay. Tell me what I'm missing.

18:26.496 --> 18:29.673
There's always gonna be second
guessing in any major operation,

18:29.717 --> 18:31.893
especially when
one of our own gets hurt.

18:31.936 --> 18:33.460
Sometimes it's justified.

18:33.503 --> 18:34.983
Just because
an officer goes down

18:35.026 --> 18:36.637
doesn't mean somebody
screwed up.

18:36.680 --> 18:40.641
You and Detective Pierce went
to the Academy together, right?

18:40.684 --> 18:43.078
Yeah, so?

18:43.122 --> 18:44.949
You're personal friends?

18:44.993 --> 18:47.082
Doesn't mean
I'm covering for him.

18:47.126 --> 18:48.736
I'm glad to hear that.

18:48.779 --> 18:51.478
Fact is, you had the best view
of Detective Pierce's actions.

18:51.521 --> 18:53.349
And he did his job.

18:53.393 --> 18:58.267
I hope so, because
if I find out Pierce froze

18:58.311 --> 19:00.487
and you weren't
straight with me,

19:00.530 --> 19:02.402
I'm coming after both of you.

19:19.114 --> 19:20.681
You on another
stakeout?

19:20.724 --> 19:23.118
No. You and I got to chat.
Let's take a walk.

19:23.162 --> 19:24.728
That's why they
make barstools.

19:24.772 --> 19:27.427
Yeah, well, we can't be seen
together right now, you and me.

19:27.470 --> 19:29.516
Heard IAB's
asking questions.

19:29.559 --> 19:31.344
You heard right. They're
looking at the takedown.

19:31.387 --> 19:33.433
Looking at me?
Yup.

19:33.476 --> 19:35.086
Saying I froze up
out there?

19:35.130 --> 19:37.828
Something like that.

19:37.872 --> 19:39.395
What did you say?

19:39.439 --> 19:42.790
What do you think I said?
I had your back.

19:42.833 --> 19:44.748
I appreciate it,
Danny.
Uh-huh.

19:44.792 --> 19:48.491
Look, they're not gonna
give up on this, IAB.

19:48.535 --> 19:49.840
They're gonna
call me back in.

19:49.884 --> 19:51.494
I need to know what
really happened in there.

19:51.538 --> 19:52.974
Hey, like I
told you, I...

19:53.017 --> 19:55.803
No, I know what you told me,
okay, and I'm not buying it.

19:55.846 --> 19:57.326
You want me to
stick up for you,

19:57.370 --> 19:59.328
you got to give
me the truth.

20:02.462 --> 20:04.855
Honestly, Danny, I don't know
what the hell happened.

20:04.899 --> 20:07.467
I've been in a lot
tighter spots than that.

20:07.510 --> 20:09.077
Yeah, Tommy, I get it.

20:09.120 --> 20:11.471
There's nobody I'd rather be
in a foxhole with,

20:11.514 --> 20:13.473
but something changed. What?

20:13.516 --> 20:16.345
No, it was like...

20:16.389 --> 20:19.566
All I could think about was...

20:19.609 --> 20:22.395
was my baby girl, you know?

20:23.787 --> 20:24.875
What would've happened if...

20:24.919 --> 20:26.268
Plenty of cops have kids.

20:26.312 --> 20:28.531
But you still got to be able
to do the job

20:28.575 --> 20:29.967
or you're gonna put
people's lives in danger.

20:30.011 --> 20:33.754
I know, I know,
it's just still brand-new.

20:33.797 --> 20:35.408
You know?
And we waited so damn long.

20:35.451 --> 20:37.279
Look, I-I know
it's a big ask, Danny,

20:37.323 --> 20:40.978
but if you stand up for me,
IAB has no case.

20:41.022 --> 20:44.286
I promise you
this will never happen again.

20:45.331 --> 20:47.942
Tommy, it better not.

20:49.596 --> 20:50.945
ERIN:
Thank you both for coming in.

20:50.988 --> 20:52.990
MR. HILL:
My lawyer told
me not to come.

20:53.034 --> 20:55.297
We're flying home tonight,
so whatever you have to say,

20:55.341 --> 20:56.603
say it fast.

20:56.646 --> 20:58.996
I appreciate your position.

20:59.040 --> 21:01.347
I need you to understand mine.

21:01.390 --> 21:02.522
We have the power

21:02.565 --> 21:04.393
to compel Tonya's testimony,

21:04.437 --> 21:06.047
and no lawyer can quash
a legitimate subpoena

21:06.090 --> 21:07.614
from this office.

21:09.659 --> 21:11.792
So you're gonna force me
to take the stand?

21:11.835 --> 21:13.315
To see those men?

21:13.359 --> 21:15.186
I have the responsibility
to make sure

21:15.230 --> 21:17.624
the men who victimized you
pay for their crimes.

21:17.667 --> 21:18.755
Give me a break.

21:18.799 --> 21:20.191
With what you're gonna
put her through,

21:20.235 --> 21:22.324
y-you guys are almost
as bad as they are.

21:22.368 --> 21:24.674
However, despite the fact
this is our only chance

21:24.718 --> 21:29.288
for a conviction, I have decided
not to force Tonya to testify.

21:31.464 --> 21:32.639
Are you serious?

21:32.682 --> 21:34.684
Thank you, Ms. Reagan.

21:34.728 --> 21:38.079
The men who hurt you didn't care
about the pain they caused.

21:38.122 --> 21:40.647
I do. I don't want you
to suffer anymore.

21:40.690 --> 21:42.431
I just want this
all to be over with.

21:42.475 --> 21:44.651
I know.

21:44.694 --> 21:49.395
Unlike the men who did this,
I'm gonna give you a choice.

21:49.438 --> 21:51.353
You can fly
home tonight.

21:51.397 --> 21:53.268
But if you do,
the men who hurt you

21:53.312 --> 21:54.878
will go right on hurting others.

21:54.922 --> 21:57.620
I-I don't want that to happen.

21:57.664 --> 22:00.057
Then you have
a decision to make.

22:00.101 --> 22:03.670
Is it harder to take the stand
and tell your story

22:03.713 --> 22:05.585
or live with the knowledge

22:05.628 --> 22:09.240
that you could've saved others
from a similar fate?

22:18.511 --> 22:20.469
What the hell are you doing?

22:20.513 --> 22:22.166
Checking the meat.That's not what
I'm talking about

22:22.210 --> 22:23.820
and you know it.

22:23.864 --> 22:25.300
None of your
officers showed up

22:25.344 --> 22:27.998
for their scheduled
court appearances on Friday.

22:28.042 --> 22:32.046
Must've put quite a strain
on the system.

22:32.089 --> 22:34.440
You could have at least
given me the heads-up

22:34.483 --> 22:36.659
you were disrupting
active cases.

22:36.703 --> 22:40.881
Like the heads-up I got
on the new marijuana policy?

22:40.924 --> 22:43.318
That is the D.A.'s decision.

22:43.362 --> 22:45.015
Look at you, passing the buck.

22:45.059 --> 22:47.235
No, it is my policy.

22:47.278 --> 22:50.543
But the timing and scope
of rollout rests with the D.A.

22:50.586 --> 22:55.199
Look, anyone who asks the NYPD
not to enforce the laws

22:55.243 --> 22:57.593
is gonna get the same response.

22:57.637 --> 22:59.160
Being what?

22:59.203 --> 23:02.381
Take a hike, respectfully.

23:09.605 --> 23:11.955
This needs more time.

23:13.783 --> 23:17.047
And the poor guy's insurance
wouldn't pay for it.

23:17.091 --> 23:18.658
That's terrible.Yeah.

23:18.701 --> 23:19.789
What was he thinking?

23:19.833 --> 23:21.748
Hey, could we talk
about my wedding?

23:21.791 --> 23:23.097
My wedding?
You marrying yourself?

23:23.140 --> 23:25.708
It's just the way women
phrase it, Jamie.

23:25.752 --> 23:27.580
Okay, ourwedding.

23:27.623 --> 23:29.408
Pretty sure I remember you
telling us

23:29.451 --> 23:31.627
we're not allowed
to talk about your wedding.

23:31.671 --> 23:35.501
You're okay to talk about it
if I bring it up.

23:35.544 --> 23:36.806
Oh!

23:36.850 --> 23:38.895
Any other guidelines
we should know about?

23:38.939 --> 23:41.594
I vote for a destination
wedding. Someplace beachy.

23:41.637 --> 23:44.205
You do have some idea
what a cop makes, right?

23:44.248 --> 23:45.554
It's tradition
for the father of the bride

23:45.598 --> 23:47.600
to pay for the wedding...

23:49.036 --> 23:50.733
I'm so sorry.

23:50.777 --> 23:51.778
Hey, that's okay.

23:51.821 --> 23:53.954
Okay. How can we help?

23:53.997 --> 23:56.565
Well, are there any family
traditions that I should...

23:56.609 --> 23:58.785
weshould be thinking about?

23:58.828 --> 23:59.960
Well, church.

24:00.003 --> 24:01.178
Any particular one?

24:01.222 --> 24:02.963
I'm guessing Roman Catholic?

24:03.006 --> 24:05.269
I know, I meant, wha-- uh,
the

24:05.313 --> 24:07.924
Oh, um, Point O' Woods
on Fire Island.

24:07.968 --> 24:10.623
Jack's family had spent
summers there for generations.

24:10.666 --> 24:12.668
Episcopals.Pop.

24:12.712 --> 24:14.540
We had to ship in a priest
for the day.

24:14.583 --> 24:16.280
Literally
bring him over by boat.

24:16.324 --> 24:17.760
All right, you need
to get over it, Pop.

24:17.804 --> 24:19.370
Maybe one day.

24:20.371 --> 24:21.677
Where was yours again, Dad?

24:21.721 --> 24:24.288
Holy Trinity in Bensonhurst.

24:24.332 --> 24:26.726
Yeah, I remember all the stained
glass and that marble.

24:26.769 --> 24:29.598
Yeah, but now there's
a Home Depot on that site.

24:29.642 --> 24:31.121
DANNY:
Not for nothing,

24:31.165 --> 24:33.297
but mine and Linda's place does
fit all the criteria,

24:33.341 --> 24:36.518
and it's on Staten Island,
which is kind of a destination.

24:36.562 --> 24:37.693
:
That's not what I meant.

24:37.737 --> 24:39.129
What? It's Staten Island.

24:39.173 --> 24:41.523
It's an island. It has beaches.

24:41.567 --> 24:42.481
Yeah, but the name...

24:42.524 --> 24:43.656
What?
It's not...

24:43.699 --> 24:45.875
Our Lady of Perpetual
Sorrows, right?

24:45.919 --> 24:48.312
Okay, the name stinks,
but the ambiance is wonderful.

24:48.356 --> 24:49.618
I'm sure it is.

24:49.662 --> 24:51.185
Well, why not St. Angelus?

24:51.228 --> 24:53.404
I got married there,
we go to church there

24:53.448 --> 24:55.058
every Sunday.

24:55.102 --> 24:58.627
It's about as strong a family
tradition as you could ask for.

24:58.671 --> 25:01.282
That'd be nice. Of course,
it's totally up to you two.

25:01.325 --> 25:03.066
Yeah.
You?

25:03.110 --> 25:04.546
Okay by me.

25:04.590 --> 25:05.634
ERIN:
Great.

25:05.678 --> 25:07.723
Done. How about the honeymoon?

25:07.767 --> 25:09.638
Um, what did you do?

25:09.682 --> 25:13.207
Oh, well, we rented
the cutest cottage

25:13.250 --> 25:14.904
on Cisco Beach in Nantucket.

25:14.948 --> 25:16.340
We had a blast.

25:16.384 --> 25:17.733
Yeah.Mm.

25:17.777 --> 25:19.474
And remember
those lobster rolls?

25:19.518 --> 25:21.520
Oh, my gosh.We went to that
lobster roll place

25:21.563 --> 25:23.347
six days in a row,
it was so delicious.So good.

25:23.391 --> 25:24.566
Pop, we rented those bikes.
You could ride around

25:24.610 --> 25:25.654
that whole island
in three hours.

25:27.134 --> 25:29.615
Remember, the blues were
running early that year?

25:29.658 --> 25:31.704
Wait... wait.We could whistle them in.

25:31.747 --> 25:33.619
NICKY:
Obviously, I wasn't born yet,

25:33.662 --> 25:35.446
but my whole life,
I've heard these stories.

25:35.490 --> 25:36.796
Oh, a thousand times.

25:36.839 --> 25:38.667
Wait, you all went
on Erin's honeymoon?

25:38.711 --> 25:39.755
ERIN:
Yeah.
Yeah.

25:39.799 --> 25:41.017
Yeah, it was, like,
a family affair.

25:41.061 --> 25:42.453
Of course we did.

25:42.497 --> 25:44.281
All of us.You should see the pictures.

25:44.325 --> 25:46.327
Okay. I get it.DANNY: The lobster,
the food, the clams...

25:46.370 --> 25:49.896
Okay. You guys, you all had me
for, like, a second.

25:49.939 --> 25:52.463
What?

25:52.507 --> 25:56.555
What do you mean, "what"?

25:57.643 --> 26:00.515
Never mind. Sorry.

26:02.343 --> 26:05.520
No, please, I-I...
it was just...

26:05.564 --> 26:06.782
Well, to be fair,

26:06.826 --> 26:09.785
you did ask us
about our family traditions.

26:23.190 --> 26:25.584
You guy-- not again, please.

26:25.627 --> 26:26.759
You guys.

26:26.802 --> 26:27.760
Really?

26:27.803 --> 26:29.370
Again?It's too easy.

26:29.413 --> 26:30.632
So easy.

26:30.676 --> 26:32.939
Ah, it's too easy.

26:36.899 --> 26:38.074
Irish exit?

26:39.902 --> 26:41.861
I have a lot of work to do.

26:41.904 --> 26:43.558
How do you do that?

26:43.602 --> 26:45.168
Do what?

26:45.212 --> 26:47.780
One minute, you and Grandpa
are in a cold war...

26:47.823 --> 26:51.000
It's not a war.
It's more like a disagreement.

26:51.044 --> 26:53.960
And the next,
you're playing tricks together.

26:54.003 --> 26:55.048
You mean dinner?

26:55.091 --> 26:57.572
Yeah.Every once in a while,

26:57.616 --> 27:01.924
as often as we can,
dinner needs to be a green zone.

27:01.968 --> 27:03.752
But how do you just put aside
whatever you...?

27:03.796 --> 27:06.146
With a lot of effort.

27:06.189 --> 27:07.800
Because it's important.

27:07.843 --> 27:13.153
Because it may just be the best
tradition this family has.

27:13.196 --> 27:17.244
There had to have been one
where you just couldn't?

27:17.287 --> 27:18.985
There's been a lot,
and you've been at a lot.

27:19.028 --> 27:20.073
And then what?

27:20.116 --> 27:22.771
When dinner's over,
the war resumes?

27:22.815 --> 27:24.207
Disagreement.

27:24.251 --> 27:27.210
And, yes, sometimes
you can't just...

27:27.254 --> 27:31.432
paint over it or laugh it off.

27:32.433 --> 27:34.391
Maybe...

27:34.435 --> 27:37.394
I-I really do have
a lot of work, so...

27:38.657 --> 27:40.702
Call me when you get home.

27:59.155 --> 28:00.940
Hanging out with your friends?

28:02.376 --> 28:04.378
Ha, ha.

28:05.640 --> 28:07.686
49 to 30?

28:07.729 --> 28:10.297
How do you stay interested?

28:10.340 --> 28:12.734
For the lessons in character.

28:12.778 --> 28:15.998
Sorry I'm not
very good company tonight.

28:16.042 --> 28:18.044
No, no.

28:19.567 --> 28:22.483
Is that what you were
doing the other day,

28:22.526 --> 28:24.703
bigfooting that call?

28:24.746 --> 28:28.054
Giving those cops
a lesson in character?

28:30.970 --> 28:32.928
That was nothing.

28:32.972 --> 28:34.234
That's not what I heard.

28:34.277 --> 28:35.844
Sergeants handle jobs
in the field every day.

28:35.888 --> 28:38.891
You saying it had nothing
to do with Officer Ramos?

28:38.934 --> 28:40.544
That's right.

28:40.588 --> 28:45.767
Every cop in the precinct thinks
you did the right thing, Jamie.

28:45.811 --> 28:47.769
Including Ramos.

28:47.813 --> 28:50.076
So I should just get over it?

28:50.119 --> 28:53.122
Yeah. You did your job.

28:53.166 --> 28:56.038
Well, maybe this job
isn't for me.

28:56.082 --> 28:58.301
And how's that?

28:58.345 --> 29:00.651
JAMIE:
Because I signed on

29:00.695 --> 29:03.002
to maybe prevent tragedies,
not set them in motion.

29:04.655 --> 29:05.744
Can I get you anything?

29:07.963 --> 29:10.836
No, we're, uh,
we're all good, Pop, thanks.

29:18.104 --> 29:22.108
So, what, you'd just
give back the stripes?

29:22.151 --> 29:25.067
Danny never became a boss,
and he's a hell of a cop.

29:25.111 --> 29:26.329
Yeah, you're not Danny.

29:28.331 --> 29:32.074
You can do whatever you want
with this job.

29:32.118 --> 29:33.815
You could be PC
if you want.

29:33.859 --> 29:35.295
Just because
you can do something

29:35.338 --> 29:36.992
doesn't mean you should.

29:37.036 --> 29:39.603
I was a damn good cop
on the street.

29:39.647 --> 29:42.041
Maybe I should've
just stayed there.

29:53.661 --> 29:54.793
Reagan.

29:56.490 --> 29:58.492
Yeah, okay.

30:03.062 --> 30:05.064
Close the door.

30:06.848 --> 30:08.589
What are you doing
down here, boss?

30:08.632 --> 30:09.808
I'm not here.

30:09.851 --> 30:11.157
Come again?

30:11.200 --> 30:13.594
This meeting never happened.
We never talked.

30:13.637 --> 30:16.466
Oh. This is about
the IAB investigation.

30:16.510 --> 30:19.165
This is about you
being smart, Danny.

30:19.208 --> 30:22.603
Mm-hmm. I've known Tommy Pierce
for 25 years.

30:22.646 --> 30:24.431
So buy him a silver tea set.

30:24.474 --> 30:26.215
But don't toss
your career away for him.

30:26.259 --> 30:27.695
You don't understand.

30:27.738 --> 30:29.088
I understand fully. All right?

30:29.131 --> 30:31.699
Pierce froze and he's going down
for cowardice.

30:31.742 --> 30:33.962
The only question is whether
you're going with him.

30:34.006 --> 30:37.096
No. IAB said they need
my statement to nail Tommy.

30:37.139 --> 30:39.272
They're not getting
my statement.

30:39.315 --> 30:40.577
Yeah, they are.

30:40.621 --> 30:44.146
Okay, look, maybe
he froze up for a second.

30:44.190 --> 30:46.105
Okay? But you know it happens.

30:46.148 --> 30:48.716
Not with a fellow officer
bleeding a few feet away.

30:48.759 --> 30:50.109
There's no excuse
for that.

30:50.152 --> 30:52.894
I get that, but it's just
one tiny little second

30:52.938 --> 30:55.027
in decades of great work.

30:55.070 --> 30:57.899
We don't get to pick
our defining moments, Danny.

30:57.943 --> 31:02.512
Oh, it was the old man
who sent you here

31:02.556 --> 31:03.687
You know better than that.

31:03.731 --> 31:05.733
You also know
he won't step up

31:05.776 --> 31:08.344
and save your shield
if you lie to IAB.

31:08.388 --> 31:11.565
And you ought to know better
that I would never ask him to,

31:11.608 --> 31:13.697
nor would I want him to.

31:13.741 --> 31:16.004
Danny, you got to get ahead
of this thing.

31:18.267 --> 31:20.269
I can't.

31:25.231 --> 31:27.363
You ran away from home
nine months ago?

31:27.407 --> 31:30.627
Yes. My parents and I
were fighting.

31:30.671 --> 31:32.238
How did you meet the defendants?

31:32.281 --> 31:35.110
I met them on the street.

31:35.154 --> 31:38.113
They bought me a meal
and they said

31:38.157 --> 31:40.289
they had an apartment
where I could stay.

31:51.735 --> 31:53.694
What happened there?

31:53.737 --> 31:57.654
They forced me
to have sex with men.

31:57.698 --> 31:59.700
And the men paid them.

31:59.743 --> 32:01.049
Did you try to refuse?

32:01.093 --> 32:03.834
Yes, but, um,

32:03.878 --> 32:05.880
they would tie me up
and beat me,

32:05.924 --> 32:09.710
burn me with lit cigarettes.

32:15.455 --> 32:18.414
These are photos of Ms. Hill's
injuries on the day

32:18.458 --> 32:20.460
authorities rescued her.

32:32.037 --> 32:35.214
Are the individuals who did this
in the courtroom today, Tonya?

32:37.738 --> 32:39.522
Yeah.

32:49.706 --> 32:51.926
That's them.

33:04.591 --> 33:06.549
You sandbagged me, Counselor.

33:06.593 --> 33:08.551
Sir?

33:08.595 --> 33:11.511
I've got a daughter her age.
But you knew that, right?

33:11.554 --> 33:13.513
Hmm, you figured I'd watch
that kid fall apart,

33:13.556 --> 33:15.515
see her old man go to pieces,

33:15.558 --> 33:17.734
and I'd have a come-to-Jesus
moment, am I right?

33:17.778 --> 33:19.998
I just thought you
should see the reality

33:20.041 --> 33:22.174
of what these
victims go through.

33:22.217 --> 33:25.177
I get lobbied 24/7, Counselor.

33:25.220 --> 33:28.745
By people selling their souls
on layaway plans.

33:28.789 --> 33:30.834
I understand that.In my position,

33:30.878 --> 33:33.663
if I allow emotion
to govern my decisions,

33:33.707 --> 33:35.013
I'd be out on my ass.

33:35.056 --> 33:37.711
And yet, in your position,
you're the only one

33:37.754 --> 33:40.409
who can help us stop
these sex traffickers.

33:40.453 --> 33:42.368
You want this real bad, huh?

33:42.411 --> 33:43.934
Of course I do.

33:43.978 --> 33:46.502
All right.

33:46.546 --> 33:48.069
I could cut a deal
with the speaker

33:48.113 --> 33:49.462
to push the law through.

33:49.505 --> 33:51.377
You could or you will?

33:51.420 --> 33:54.249
I'm rolling out a pretty tough
crime bill this spring.

33:54.293 --> 33:56.208
I'll need your boss's support.

33:56.251 --> 33:59.646
The D.A. doesn't consult me
on policy.

33:59.689 --> 34:02.431
Yeah, but he respects you.
Otherwise, you wouldn't be here.

34:02.475 --> 34:04.520
I could use a thumbs-up

34:04.564 --> 34:05.913
from your old man, too.

34:05.956 --> 34:07.741
But I haven't read the bill yet.

34:07.784 --> 34:09.917
Call it a leap of faith.

34:13.007 --> 34:15.009
Okay.

34:17.838 --> 34:19.840
Welcome to the varsity.

34:24.801 --> 34:26.934
You don't have
to do this, Danny.

34:26.977 --> 34:28.936
If it were me they were asking
questions about,

34:28.979 --> 34:30.720
you'd have my back, too.

34:30.764 --> 34:33.897
If you hung a wounded officer
out to dry?

34:33.941 --> 34:36.117
Not a chance.Well, thank God
the wounded officer's

34:36.161 --> 34:38.293
gonna be okay,
and I took out the shooter.

34:39.642 --> 34:41.992
Besides, you're not me
and I'm not you.

34:45.779 --> 34:46.867
Danny.

34:48.956 --> 34:50.740
Detective Reagan.

34:59.009 --> 35:00.837
What are you doing here?

35:00.881 --> 35:01.882
SLOAN:
Your interview

35:01.925 --> 35:03.927
is no longer required,
Detective.

35:03.971 --> 35:07.105
Because you're dropping
the investigation?

35:07.148 --> 35:09.846
Detective Pierce
has made a full statement.

35:09.890 --> 35:10.891
Meaning what?

35:10.934 --> 35:13.285
I'll let you two discuss that.

35:13.328 --> 35:16.114
I'm done here.

35:23.121 --> 35:25.210
Want to tell me
what the hell's going on?

35:25.253 --> 35:28.038
I just did what I should've done
in the first place.

35:28.082 --> 35:29.649
Tommy, what are
you talking about?

35:29.692 --> 35:31.477
Danny, I couldn't live
with what I did.

35:31.520 --> 35:33.000
All right?

35:33.043 --> 35:34.044
And I sure as hell
couldn't let you

35:34.088 --> 35:35.437
get jammed up because of me.

35:35.481 --> 35:37.004
So what's gonna happen?

35:37.047 --> 35:39.485
I'm retiring, man.

35:39.528 --> 35:41.617
I just turned
in my shield.

35:41.661 --> 35:44.272
Why the hell didn't you come
and talk to me about it first?

35:44.316 --> 35:45.795
What, so you could
talk me out of it?

35:45.839 --> 35:47.493
I don't know, maybe.

35:47.536 --> 35:49.712
Look, it's done.
Okay, it's done.

35:49.756 --> 35:52.237
We both know it's right.

35:53.499 --> 35:55.588
Well, what are you gonna do now?

36:00.114 --> 36:02.899
I don't know yet.

36:02.943 --> 36:05.075
I mean, you guys gonna be okay?

36:05.119 --> 36:06.729
Do you need help with anything?

36:06.773 --> 36:09.036
Yeah, we'll be okay.

36:09.079 --> 36:10.907
It's funny.

36:10.951 --> 36:14.868
You know... being a cop's been
my whole life for so long.

36:14.911 --> 36:18.567
Last few days, I realized...

36:18.611 --> 36:21.222
it's just not my life anymore.

36:21.266 --> 36:23.964
Things kind of change
when you become a dad, yeah.

36:24.007 --> 36:26.227
That is my life now.

36:26.271 --> 36:30.405
Everything else I'll figure out.

36:30.449 --> 36:32.451
I know you will.

36:37.064 --> 36:39.632
All right, Saturday
morning, flag football.

36:39.675 --> 36:41.895
I expect to see you and Sean.

36:41.938 --> 36:43.288
We'll be there.

36:43.331 --> 36:44.941
Good.

36:44.985 --> 36:46.987
See you around.

37:13.100 --> 37:15.668
Here I am, Pop.

37:15.711 --> 37:18.584
Thanks for coming out.

37:18.627 --> 37:21.804
You know what this place is?

37:21.848 --> 37:23.806
Yeah. Cop Arlington.

37:23.850 --> 37:26.026
Police Arlington.

37:26.069 --> 37:27.897
I know what it is, Pop.

37:27.941 --> 37:29.899
Eddie talk to you?

37:29.943 --> 37:33.033
No, she did not.

37:33.076 --> 37:34.774
Give me some credit.

37:34.817 --> 37:38.168
I've known you
since the day you were born.

37:38.212 --> 37:41.128
Copy that.

37:41.171 --> 37:44.131
Everyone that is buried here
either died in the line of duty

37:44.174 --> 37:46.829
or sent other officers
to their death.

37:46.873 --> 37:49.223
I accept the risk to me.

37:49.267 --> 37:52.226
I signed up with eyes wide open.

37:53.445 --> 37:55.447
But I don't think
I'm cut out for command.

37:55.490 --> 37:58.014
The department can't function
without command.

37:58.058 --> 38:00.408
I get that.

38:00.452 --> 38:03.019
I also get that Officer Ramos
almost lost his life

38:03.063 --> 38:05.065
as a result of my order.Almost.

38:05.108 --> 38:07.110
Almo-- Pop.But one will die

38:07.154 --> 38:09.852
one day, don't get me wrong.

38:09.896 --> 38:12.246
And maybe not the only one.

38:12.290 --> 38:16.772
But a strong leader,
which is in you,

38:16.816 --> 38:20.950
will have saved more
lives than he lost

38:20.994 --> 38:22.996
when it comes to
the end of the day.

38:42.189 --> 38:43.973
Got a minute?

38:44.017 --> 38:46.193
That depends.

38:55.985 --> 38:58.118
Hear me out. Please?

39:00.294 --> 39:02.905
The six original hockey teams

39:02.949 --> 39:07.649
played against each other
14 or 15 times in a season.

39:07.693 --> 39:10.870
Real hatred sprung up,
real teeth got knocked out,

39:10.913 --> 39:12.654
real eyes got gouged.

39:12.698 --> 39:14.830
And by the end
of the season,

39:14.874 --> 39:16.354
before the playoffs,

39:16.397 --> 39:19.095
a lot of the guys wanted
to kill each other.

39:19.139 --> 39:21.141
This is you and me?

39:22.969 --> 39:27.756
A custom took hold in the 1930s.

39:27.800 --> 39:30.150
After each deciding game
in the playoffs,

39:30.193 --> 39:33.066
players lined up
on the ice, shook hands,

39:33.109 --> 39:35.373
congratulated,
consoled each other.

39:35.416 --> 39:37.113
They still do it today.

39:37.157 --> 39:39.725
Unique in professional sports.

39:39.768 --> 39:43.032
So you and I are
gonna shake hands?

39:43.076 --> 39:46.601
You sprung your new policy on me
without a heads-up,

39:46.645 --> 39:48.168
I took it personally,

39:48.211 --> 39:51.780
I held my cops
from your courts for a day.

39:51.824 --> 39:54.304
That was aimed right at you.

39:56.524 --> 39:59.135
Takes a lot to admit that.

40:00.180 --> 40:02.530
I'm not proud of it.

40:04.924 --> 40:10.103
But I also think that I wouldn't
change the way I handled it.

40:12.801 --> 40:15.325
Look,

40:15.369 --> 40:19.721
this isn't the first time
and it sure won't be the last.

40:19.765 --> 40:23.116
We can't be father and daughter
out there.

40:24.247 --> 40:27.250
On the ice.

40:29.339 --> 40:31.690
So to speak.

40:31.733 --> 40:33.909
We may very well

40:33.953 --> 40:38.479
be playing against each other
14 or 15 times in the season.

40:38.523 --> 40:43.484
And there is gonna be
missing teeth and busted noses

40:43.528 --> 40:45.312
and trash talk.

40:45.355 --> 40:48.271
So to speak.

40:50.448 --> 40:52.275
But no matter what,

40:52.319 --> 40:55.104
we know we are lining up
on the ice and shaking hands

40:55.148 --> 40:58.064
after the final buzzer.

41:01.328 --> 41:05.593
I have recommended
a revised marijuana policy.

41:05.637 --> 41:08.770
It mandates prosecution
of any individual

41:08.814 --> 41:13.514
that causes public harm
through marijuana use.

41:13.558 --> 41:17.387
A judgment call to be made
by the NYPD.

41:20.434 --> 41:24.177
I can try and live with that.

41:24.220 --> 41:26.484
Thank you.

41:28.529 --> 41:30.488
So...

41:32.707 --> 41:34.579
Shall we?

41:42.891 --> 41:44.850
Good game.

41:44.893 --> 41:46.808
Good game.
