00:34.368 --> 00:36.001
Are you a pilot?

00:36.070 --> 00:37.436
Oh, yes I am.

00:37.471 --> 00:39.104
That's what I wanna be.

00:39.140 --> 00:41.407
So far I'm good with my
take offs,

00:41.442 --> 00:42.841
but my landings need work.

00:42.877 --> 00:44.109
They do?

00:44.178 --> 00:46.412
It's just an app but
it feels real.

00:47.581 --> 00:50.549
Well, one day it will be.

00:50.618 --> 00:52.418
Until then...

00:52.453 --> 00:55.287
Here is your first set of wings.

00:55.322 --> 00:57.489
Thanks.

00:57.558 --> 00:59.458
You're welcome.
Merry Christmas.

00:59.527 --> 01:00.926
Merry Christmas.

01:05.866 --> 01:07.499
Hi, Zoey.

01:07.535 --> 01:10.469
Hey, Phil, how's the charter
business going?

01:10.504 --> 01:12.271
It's great, I just bought a
bigger plane.

01:12.306 --> 01:14.473
You're my role model.

01:14.542 --> 01:16.353
Well, I'm auctioning off my old
piper next month.

01:16.377 --> 01:17.409
You should bid.

01:17.445 --> 01:18.610
Maybe I will.

01:18.679 --> 01:20.512
I hope you do.
Have a Merry Christmas.

01:20.548 --> 01:22.147
Merry Christmas, Phil.

01:47.808 --> 01:49.441
<i>Hey, honey.
Hi, mom.</i>

01:49.477 --> 01:51.376
Your dad's here too, I'm putting
you on speaker.

01:51.412 --> 01:52.811
Hi, honey!

01:52.880 --> 01:54.913
Well, I just got the letter.

01:54.949 --> 01:56.915
The probates cleared.

01:56.984 --> 02:00.185
I've officially inherited Gus
Henderson's ranch.

02:00.221 --> 02:02.187
How are you feeling about it?

02:02.223 --> 02:04.289
Honestly I'm pretty sad.

02:04.325 --> 02:07.893
I mean I can't imagine the place
without him.

02:07.928 --> 02:10.294
And I can't believe he left
it to me.

02:10.364 --> 02:11.374
Of course he left it to
you, honey,

02:11.398 --> 02:12.564
he was like your grandfather.

02:12.600 --> 02:13.832
And he taught you how to fly.

02:13.868 --> 02:15.267
I think Gus giving you his ranch

02:15.336 --> 02:17.536
is his way of helping you get
your own plane.

02:17.571 --> 02:20.172
I'd rather have Gus.

02:20.207 --> 02:23.575
But I'm on a plane tomorrow
to Alaska,

02:23.611 --> 02:26.545
I'm gonna sign the papers and...

02:26.580 --> 02:31.049
Take a look at it one last time
before I put it on the market.

02:31.085 --> 02:33.252
You are gonna be back in Tampa
in time for Christmas?

02:33.320 --> 02:34.720
<i>That's two weeks away.</i>

02:34.755 --> 02:37.890
I'll be out of Alaska in one
week... tops.

02:37.958 --> 02:39.491
Can't wait to see you.

02:39.771 --> 02:42.294
<i>- Love you.
- Love you.</i>

02:42.329 --> 02:44.096
<i>Love you too.</i>

03:01.515 --> 03:02.881
Thanks.

03:04.451 --> 03:05.784
Aurora.

03:05.853 --> 03:08.086
It's just like how I
remember it.

03:08.122 --> 03:09.254
Christmas time's the best.

03:09.323 --> 03:10.889
Yeah.

03:14.028 --> 03:17.829
Who rides a motorcycle in
December in Alaska?

03:23.404 --> 03:26.238
Otto, just try a peppermint
brownie.

03:26.273 --> 03:29.474
The customers will love them and
they're Christmassy.

03:29.510 --> 03:31.977
Anya, we serve apple pie,

03:32.012 --> 03:34.546
lemon pie, and chocolate
pudding.

03:34.615 --> 03:35.959
Nobody orders the chocolate
pudding.

03:35.983 --> 03:36.949
Yes, they do.

03:36.984 --> 03:38.550
Nobody orders it twice.

03:38.586 --> 03:40.619
Just try one of the brownies.

03:40.654 --> 03:42.287
They're delicious.

03:42.356 --> 03:43.855
Ate half a pan last night.

03:48.963 --> 03:50.362
I'll think about it.

03:58.872 --> 04:00.706
Merry Christmas.

04:00.741 --> 04:01.673
Zoey!

04:01.709 --> 04:03.408
You're here early!
Hi.

04:03.444 --> 04:04.810
Hi, Brock.
Hey.

04:04.845 --> 04:06.745
And hello, Otto.

04:06.814 --> 04:08.513
Do I know you?

04:08.549 --> 04:11.083
Otto, you remember Zoey.

04:11.118 --> 04:13.986
My best friend from high school.

04:14.021 --> 04:16.555
We used to hang out here
all the time.

04:16.589 --> 04:19.690
When I was a teenager I used
Gus's plane

04:19.726 --> 04:22.828
to buy you a replacement coil
for your deep fryer.

04:22.863 --> 04:24.396
The teenaged pilot.

04:24.465 --> 04:26.131
You saved my summer!

04:26.166 --> 04:29.301
I remember you, you were Gus
Henderson's best student.

04:29.336 --> 04:31.003
How are your parents?

04:31.071 --> 04:33.805
They're great, yeah my dad's
still working at the post office

04:33.841 --> 04:35.540
in Florida, they love the
weather.

04:35.576 --> 04:38.277
I'm so excited that you're here.

04:38.345 --> 04:40.245
You won't reconsider staying
with me and Brock?

04:40.281 --> 04:42.214
You know what? I'm gonna
stay at the ranch.

04:42.249 --> 04:44.216
It think it might be my
last chance.

04:44.285 --> 04:46.785
Okay, well then let us bring
over dinner tonight.

04:46.820 --> 04:47.853
We'll get caught up.

04:47.921 --> 04:49.621
Dinner sounds great!

04:49.657 --> 04:51.067
I'll send over some chocolate
pudding.

04:51.091 --> 04:53.458
Ooh, that's okay.

05:00.634 --> 05:01.733
Zoey Hathaway, is that you?

05:01.802 --> 05:03.302
Mrs. Walker!

05:03.337 --> 05:07.973
You're not in ninth grade
anymore, call me Tracy.

05:08.008 --> 05:09.675
I hear Gus left you his Ranch.

05:09.743 --> 05:11.276
He did.

05:11.312 --> 05:13.256
Are you gonna do the Christmas
Festival this year?

05:13.280 --> 05:15.013
It hasn't been the same since
Gus stopped.

05:15.049 --> 05:18.383
I'm only in town for a little
while, I don't think so.

05:18.419 --> 05:19.551
Well maybe next year.

05:19.586 --> 05:22.054
It's so good to see you!

05:22.122 --> 05:24.156
You're all grown up.

05:24.191 --> 05:25.624
Bye.
Bye!

05:28.495 --> 05:31.930
That takes care of the
transfer fee.

05:31.965 --> 05:34.166
Now the property is
officially yours.

05:34.201 --> 05:37.069
You know I have seen people put
their cats on these,

05:37.137 --> 05:38.137
but never a plane.

05:38.172 --> 05:40.305
Yeah, it's there to motivate me.

05:40.341 --> 05:42.140
I'd like to start my own
charter airline.

05:42.176 --> 05:45.010
And you've always wanted to fly?

05:45.079 --> 05:46.778
Pretty much.

05:46.814 --> 05:49.254
I remember when I was little I
would go with my dad to pick up

05:49.283 --> 05:51.883
the bags when Gus would do a
mail run.

05:51.919 --> 05:53.985
I'd watch that plane land
and just think,

05:54.021 --> 05:55.821
"Wow, I wanna do that".

05:55.856 --> 05:57.989
Now you are, it's all that
you hoped for?

05:58.025 --> 05:59.591
Honestly, it's better.

05:59.626 --> 06:02.294
It's like getting paid to
have fun.

06:02.329 --> 06:04.496
Sometimes I think I'm more
at home in the air

06:04.565 --> 06:05.964
than on the ground.

06:06.033 --> 06:08.100
How long did you say you were
in town for?

06:08.135 --> 06:10.902
Just a couple of days, and then
Christmas in Florida,

06:10.938 --> 06:12.204
and back home to Seattle.

06:12.239 --> 06:13.905
Hey, you don't have a

06:13.974 --> 06:16.086
recommendation for a real estate
agent in the area, do you?

06:16.110 --> 06:17.476
Absolutely.

06:20.447 --> 06:23.548
It's a small town, we all wear
a lot of hats.

06:23.584 --> 06:25.350
Well, you are hired.

06:25.386 --> 06:28.653
Well I'll go through my buyers
list, but if no one bites

06:28.689 --> 06:30.333
we might not be able to sell the
ranch until Spring.

06:30.357 --> 06:32.724
Is that gonna be a problem?

06:32.793 --> 06:34.459
These Alaskan winters can be
rough.

06:34.495 --> 06:35.994
No, it shouldn't be.

06:36.029 --> 06:37.674
Yes, a ranch like yours does
need constant care,

06:37.698 --> 06:41.233
plumbing, wiring, roofing,
but you're very lucky

06:41.268 --> 06:43.101
that your caretaker, Alec
is really good.

06:43.137 --> 06:46.037
Alec, yes, Gus mentioned him to
me over the phone.

06:46.073 --> 06:47.038
He used to be a wilderness guy?

06:47.074 --> 06:48.807
He still is.

06:48.842 --> 06:51.154
He's been helping Gus out in the
winters ever since Ida passed.

06:51.178 --> 06:52.689
Gus already paid for the entire
season, so...

06:52.713 --> 06:54.479
Thank you, Gus.

06:54.515 --> 06:57.015
All right, well let's go take a
look at your ranch.

06:57.084 --> 06:58.084
All right, let's go.

07:20.207 --> 07:23.241
Well, it's a little isolated
out here

07:23.277 --> 07:24.409
but Alec is usually around.

07:24.478 --> 07:25.877
There's his pickup.

07:25.913 --> 07:28.146
I love this place so much.

07:28.182 --> 07:30.315
You moved away just before I cam
to Aurora.

07:30.350 --> 07:31.995
Did you spend a lot of time here
at the ranch?

07:32.019 --> 07:33.663
Well Gus and Ida were like
grandparents to me,

07:33.687 --> 07:35.064
and I actually lived here
my senior year

07:35.088 --> 07:36.888
when my dad was transferred
to Florida.

07:36.924 --> 07:39.624
So this is like a homecoming
for you.

07:39.693 --> 07:41.827
Are you sure you wanna sell?

07:41.862 --> 07:43.862
Well, in a perfect world I'd
keep it,

07:43.897 --> 07:46.665
but my life is in Seattle.

07:46.700 --> 07:49.835
Don't make me doubt myself,
you'll lose your commission.

07:49.870 --> 07:53.638
Forget I said anything.

07:53.674 --> 07:55.218
You know if it wasn't the middle
of December,

07:55.242 --> 07:58.410
this place would be very
marketable.

07:58.445 --> 08:01.880
And there's a jeep in the
garage.

08:01.915 --> 08:04.516
Hey, Gus and Ida's trees.

08:04.551 --> 08:07.085
They've grown!

08:07.120 --> 08:09.788
It's such a sweet gesture,
planting a live Christmas tree

08:09.823 --> 08:11.122
for every year they were
married.

08:11.158 --> 08:13.959
It's like a love letter written
in trees.

08:16.563 --> 08:18.530
I love this room!

08:18.565 --> 08:20.365
It's amazing.

08:24.972 --> 08:26.738
Is this you?

08:26.773 --> 08:29.307
Yeah, that's the day I got my
pilot's license.

08:29.343 --> 08:30.876
Gus was such a good teacher.

08:30.911 --> 08:33.111
He and Ida were so kind to me.

08:33.179 --> 08:35.212
Everyone in town loved them.

08:37.183 --> 08:41.186
This brand new kitchen will
completely sell this house.

08:41.221 --> 08:45.290
Gus retired, and he sold his
Cessna to Geoff Peters,

08:45.325 --> 08:46.925
and then he put all that money

08:46.960 --> 08:49.761
into building Ida's dream
kitchen.

08:54.401 --> 08:56.401
There she is!

08:56.470 --> 08:57.869
Who?

09:00.641 --> 09:02.007
Hi, Holly.

09:02.042 --> 09:04.576
I remember when Gus and Ida
found her.

09:04.611 --> 09:07.879
She just lost her mother and
they bottle fed her.

09:07.915 --> 09:10.448
She must be 15 years old.

09:10.517 --> 09:12.918
Now you, Mister...
Never met you before.

09:12.986 --> 09:15.353
That's Palmer, Gus got
him last year.

09:15.389 --> 09:17.789
Alec has been taking such great
care of both reindeer.

09:24.765 --> 09:27.933
Quite an entrance.

09:35.943 --> 09:38.510
Are you gonna introduce me, or
should I introduce myself?

09:38.579 --> 09:41.246
Zoey Hathaway meet Alec Wynn.

09:41.281 --> 09:43.882
Nice to meet you, I've heard
such good things about you.

09:43.917 --> 09:46.785
I've heard about you too.

09:46.853 --> 09:49.087
Well I don't mean to be blunt,
but...

09:49.156 --> 09:50.555
you staying or selling?

09:52.125 --> 09:54.125
Actually, I'm selling.

09:57.364 --> 09:58.897
Well it was nice to meet you.

09:58.932 --> 10:00.877
Now if you'll excuse me, I have
a fence to repair.

10:00.901 --> 10:03.535
Palmer keeps getting out.

10:03.570 --> 10:04.869
Bye.

10:08.408 --> 10:10.675
Alec is a good guy.

10:10.711 --> 10:12.477
A little rough around the
edges, maybe.

10:12.512 --> 10:14.679
Yeah, I can see that.

10:14.748 --> 10:17.616
Hey, come here!
Come here!

10:18.986 --> 10:21.453
Hi..

10:21.521 --> 10:25.757
Hi, Palmer, I'm Zoey, nice to
meet you.

10:29.730 --> 10:32.263
It smells amazing.

10:32.299 --> 10:34.132
You need to stop working
for Otto

10:34.167 --> 10:35.133
and open your own restaurant.

10:35.168 --> 10:36.935
That's the master plan.

10:36.970 --> 10:40.105
Not for another few years or so.

10:40.140 --> 10:42.841
Maybe open a restaurant or B&B.

10:42.876 --> 10:44.209
What are you looking for?

10:44.244 --> 10:46.044
This.

10:46.079 --> 10:48.947
Ida had a secret recipe for
Christmas Wreath cookies.

10:48.982 --> 10:50.949
I loved those, they were
so crunchy.

10:50.984 --> 10:52.851
Everybody did, she made
hundreds of them

10:52.919 --> 10:54.252
for the Christmas Festival,

10:54.287 --> 10:56.955
and I am dying to know how she
made them.

10:56.990 --> 10:59.057
It's not here.

10:59.092 --> 11:00.859
On the plus side,

11:00.894 --> 11:02.694
if you need 20 ways to cook
salmon you're set.

11:02.729 --> 11:06.197
Thank you, good to know.

11:06.233 --> 11:08.033
I'm so glad you're here.

11:08.101 --> 11:10.101
Video chatting isn't the same.

11:10.137 --> 11:12.070
No, it's not.

11:12.105 --> 11:14.639
I love Aurora, but you see such
fabulous places.

11:14.708 --> 11:17.342
I bet you get to hang out with
the cool people every night.

11:17.377 --> 11:19.911
Guys, I'm up at four in
the morning,

11:19.946 --> 11:21.646
and I'm in bed at eight
at night,

11:21.682 --> 11:24.816
the cool people are being
cool without me.

11:24.851 --> 11:27.752
By the way I met Alec Wynn
today.

11:27.788 --> 11:29.587
He was not very talkative.

11:29.623 --> 11:31.256
He talked?

11:31.291 --> 11:33.202
At the diner, the most I get is
a please and a thank you.

11:33.226 --> 11:35.260
He's a nice guy, I know Gus
liked him.

11:35.295 --> 11:37.262
Yeah, so Gus mentioned him to
me on the phone.

11:37.330 --> 11:38.863
He said he trusted him,

11:38.899 --> 11:42.567
but I was actually picturing
somebody more Gus's age.

11:42.636 --> 11:44.636
So Alec is gonna stay onto the
place still?

11:44.671 --> 11:46.115
Well, I haven't talked to him
about it yet,

11:46.139 --> 11:48.773
but he's paid through the
winter, so...

11:48.809 --> 11:50.408
I just hope the place sells
really fast,

11:50.444 --> 11:53.845
and then we'll be totally
covered.

11:53.880 --> 11:57.048
Well I think dinner's ready.

11:57.084 --> 11:58.349
- Who's hungry?
- Me!

11:58.385 --> 11:59.951
- I am.
- Let's go.

12:35.055 --> 12:36.055
Coming!

12:40.026 --> 12:41.493
Good morning.

12:41.528 --> 12:43.161
I'm feeding the reindeer,

12:43.230 --> 12:44.629
I wanna show you how to do it.

12:44.664 --> 12:46.364
No, can't we do that later?

12:46.399 --> 12:47.532
No.

12:47.567 --> 12:49.067
Dress in something warm.

12:49.102 --> 12:50.835
I know how to dress.

12:54.875 --> 12:57.208
I'm here.

12:57.277 --> 13:01.112
Look at all these decorations
from the Christmas Festival.

13:02.115 --> 13:03.915
It's the sleigh.

13:03.950 --> 13:05.717
This is the sleigh!

13:05.752 --> 13:07.730
All the kids from the town get
their picture taken with Santa

13:07.754 --> 13:09.087
on this sleigh.

13:09.156 --> 13:11.289
Look at all these lights.

13:11.324 --> 13:13.158
Holly and Palmer are waiting.

13:13.193 --> 13:16.094
So sorry,

13:16.129 --> 13:18.596
didn't mean to delay
your breakfast.

13:18.632 --> 13:21.399
So the reindeer get fed twice
a day, and I aim for 6 am, 6 pm.

13:21.434 --> 13:22.867
Got it.

13:22.903 --> 13:24.435
Good.

13:24.504 --> 13:28.740
They each get one scoop
of these pellets, and some hay.

13:28.809 --> 13:31.142
You'll need more feed
in a couple of days,

13:31.178 --> 13:33.178
you can get it at the
hardware store in town.

13:34.848 --> 13:36.414
Check.

13:36.449 --> 13:38.750
Now the well freezes up
in the pump house.

13:38.785 --> 13:40.730
If the light goes out you gotta
keep an eye on that.

13:40.754 --> 13:42.620
Oil furnace needs a delivery
next month.

13:42.689 --> 13:46.257
And there's a generator back
there if the power goes out.

13:46.326 --> 13:47.326
Okay.

13:54.334 --> 13:55.433
Good luck.

13:55.468 --> 13:58.303
Good luck?
Where are you going?

14:00.307 --> 14:01.906
He's charming, isn't he?

14:17.390 --> 14:18.623
Are you leaving?

14:18.692 --> 14:21.025
It's your place now.

14:21.061 --> 14:23.661
Now that you're here it's time
for me to move on.

14:23.697 --> 14:25.964
But I'm not staying.

14:25.999 --> 14:27.498
I need you here.

14:27.534 --> 14:30.335
And Karen said Gus paid you
through the winter.

14:30.403 --> 14:31.970
And I gave you the money back.

14:34.641 --> 14:37.008
All right, I don't understand.

14:37.043 --> 14:39.177
What's really going on here?

14:39.212 --> 14:43.815
Gus loved this ranch,
he built the house himself,

14:43.850 --> 14:46.050
him and Ida planted all those trees.

14:46.119 --> 14:48.931
He didn't leave it to you just so
you could sell it to some strangers.

14:48.955 --> 14:51.656
He left it to me
so I could buy my plane.

14:51.725 --> 14:54.125
Oh yeah?
He tell you that?

14:54.194 --> 14:56.761
Well not in so many words, but
he knew I lived in Seattle,

14:56.830 --> 14:58.696
he knew I was saving up
to buy a plane.

14:58.732 --> 15:00.365
He had to know I'd sell
the ranch.

15:02.369 --> 15:04.836
Sounds like to me you're just
planning on dumping it.

15:04.871 --> 15:07.939
I'm not gonna sell it
to just anyone.

15:07.974 --> 15:10.942
I'm gonna sell it to someone who
loves it just as much as we do,

15:10.977 --> 15:12.944
and who's gonna care for it.
And the reindeer.

15:13.013 --> 15:16.080
Well what if the new owners
don't want a reindeer?

15:16.149 --> 15:17.882
You haven't thought
this through have you?

15:17.918 --> 15:19.617
Holly and Palmer deserve
a good home.

15:19.653 --> 15:23.655
I'm gonna find them a good home,
but I can't stay here, Alec.

15:23.690 --> 15:26.724
My job is in Seattle.
I need you here.

15:40.607 --> 15:43.942
What if you were involved
in the sale?

15:43.977 --> 15:47.879
How?

15:47.914 --> 15:49.047
We'll have a partnership.

15:49.082 --> 15:51.015
It can't be a partnership.

15:51.051 --> 15:52.183
Of course we can.

15:52.218 --> 15:56.054
We'll work together to find
the perfect buyer for this place.

15:56.122 --> 15:58.656
You'll be an important part of
the decision.

15:58.692 --> 16:00.191
But you hold all the cards.

16:00.260 --> 16:02.593
All right, so I'll give
you an ace.

16:02.629 --> 16:06.564
If you stay until this place sells
I'll give you 10 percent.

16:06.599 --> 16:08.333
It's not about the money.

16:08.368 --> 16:09.901
And I promise to listen

16:09.936 --> 16:12.036
to whatever you have to say
about the buyer.

16:12.072 --> 16:15.273
If you think I'm selling to
the wrong person, tell me,

16:15.308 --> 16:18.977
I'll listen,
I'm a very good listener.

16:19.012 --> 16:22.046
You sure are a good talker.

16:22.082 --> 16:26.451
If you ever get tired of flying
you can go into sales.

16:26.519 --> 16:28.219
Well, you're a tough customer.

16:28.254 --> 16:30.922
What do I have to do to seal
this deal? Throw in a toaster?

16:30.991 --> 16:35.460
I don't need a toaster.

16:35.495 --> 16:38.429
You don't know me,
why does my opinion matter?

16:38.465 --> 16:40.631
Gus trusted you.

16:40.667 --> 16:44.836
That means a lot to me.

16:44.871 --> 16:48.239
This ranch is special.

16:48.308 --> 16:49.741
It needs you.

16:49.809 --> 16:51.275
So do I.

16:52.545 --> 16:53.811
Deal?

16:59.152 --> 17:00.585
Deal.

17:06.159 --> 17:07.603
So I've only got four more days
in town

17:07.627 --> 17:09.493
and I really wanna
spruce up the place.

17:09.529 --> 17:11.863
All those real estate shows say
that the little details

17:11.931 --> 17:12.964
make a big difference.

17:12.999 --> 17:14.766
Like what?

17:14.800 --> 17:17.367
Like maybe put some Christmas
lights up around the windows.

17:17.404 --> 17:18.681
Only have to take them down
in January.

17:18.704 --> 17:20.038
But they'd be so pretty.

17:20.073 --> 17:22.339
You want stockings and candy
canes too?

17:22.375 --> 17:23.953
Maybe a train set running
through the yard?

17:23.977 --> 17:25.576
Not much of a Christmas fan,
huh?

17:25.645 --> 17:26.778
Not really.

17:26.813 --> 17:28.980
I love Christmas.

17:29.015 --> 17:32.417
Why am I not surprised?

17:32.452 --> 17:33.651
So what else are we gonna do?

17:33.720 --> 17:35.787
Well clean everything,
de-clutter,

17:35.822 --> 17:38.034
and I think the thermostat
might be broken on the furnace.

17:38.058 --> 17:39.502
I installed the furnace,
I can take a look at that.

17:39.526 --> 17:41.392
Great, thank you, and
if we need a new one

17:41.428 --> 17:43.161
I'll just grab one
at the hardware store.

17:43.196 --> 17:44.962
I have a project list too.

17:44.998 --> 17:47.432
Banister on the porch is loose,
got to trim back those trees,

17:47.467 --> 17:49.967
and we need to take a look
at that barn.

17:50.003 --> 17:53.371
We make a good team.

17:53.406 --> 17:57.375
Yeah.

17:57.410 --> 18:02.080
Okay.

18:02.148 --> 18:06.317
These boards are all worn out,
we'll have to clear the whole barn.

18:07.921 --> 18:10.088
Well we can't have everything.

18:10.123 --> 18:11.823
I guess the floor can wait.

18:15.395 --> 18:18.863
I promise that we will find you
a good home.

18:24.204 --> 18:27.171
That's a cool picture.
Who took that?

18:30.076 --> 18:31.876
I did.

18:33.713 --> 18:35.279
I saw some camera equipment.

18:35.348 --> 18:36.747
So that...
are you a professional?

18:36.783 --> 18:38.883
No, just a hobby.

18:38.918 --> 18:40.818
That's cool.

18:40.854 --> 18:43.154
Okay, I'm gonna go
to the hardware store

18:43.189 --> 18:45.156
and get a little bit more
reindeer feed.

18:45.191 --> 18:48.259
Karen said something about me
inheriting a Jeep?

18:48.294 --> 18:49.794
Can you drive stick?

18:49.829 --> 18:51.863
Can I drive stick?

18:51.898 --> 18:55.399
If it's got wheels, wings
or a rudder I can make it go.

19:07.480 --> 19:09.380
Merry Christmas,
how can I help you?

19:09.415 --> 19:12.016
Hi, I need a new one of these,
do you have one?

19:12.051 --> 19:15.353
Yeah, one thermostat coming up,
anything else?

19:15.388 --> 19:17.455
Yeah.

19:22.262 --> 19:23.828
Is that everything?

19:23.897 --> 19:25.897
It's a start.

19:25.932 --> 19:28.199
Cool.

19:28.234 --> 19:30.234
Are you the pilot? The one that
used to live here?

19:30.270 --> 19:32.170
Yes.

19:32.205 --> 19:33.171
I always wanted to learn
how to fly,

19:33.206 --> 19:37.041
and then Gus sold his plane
before I could take any lessons, so...

19:37.110 --> 19:39.143
Could you teach me?

19:39.179 --> 19:41.612
I'm only here for a couple
of days, I don't have time.

19:41.648 --> 19:43.214
That's too bad.

19:45.118 --> 19:46.951
Zoey, you're exactly
who I need to talk to,

19:47.020 --> 19:48.719
but just one second.

19:48.755 --> 19:51.055
Hey Danny, George is tying
a Christmas tree up to my car,

19:51.090 --> 19:52.268
could you ring it up for me, please?

19:52.292 --> 19:53.457
Yeah, sure thing Mrs. Yazzi.

19:53.493 --> 19:54.937
- Thanks.
- Fixing things up out there?

19:54.961 --> 19:56.827
Yeah, starting to.

19:56.863 --> 20:00.398
All right, well no pressure,
but I just spoke with a potential buyer,

20:00.433 --> 20:03.935
I cannot believe how lucky we are,
but they're actually very interested.

20:03.970 --> 20:05.214
Can I bring them out
tomorrow morning?

20:05.238 --> 20:06.938
Absolutely.

20:07.006 --> 20:08.884
All right, try and make the
ranch look as homey as possible.

20:08.908 --> 20:10.808
This might be our last chance
until spring.

20:10.843 --> 20:11.976
Like I said, no pressure.

20:12.011 --> 20:13.177
You got it.

20:13.213 --> 20:14.812
Thank you, Danny,
Merry Christmas.

20:14.847 --> 20:16.781
I'll see you tomorrow,
fingers crossed.

20:16.816 --> 20:17.949
Fingers crossed!

20:17.984 --> 20:19.617
Know what?

20:19.652 --> 20:21.764
I'm gonna go check out your
Christmas trees out there.

20:21.788 --> 20:23.788
- I'll be back.
- Sure.

20:38.371 --> 20:40.871
Here comes Santa Claus!

20:40.907 --> 20:42.740
You bought a tree?

20:42.775 --> 20:44.675
We have a buyer coming tomorrow.

20:44.711 --> 20:47.378
Karen thinks we should make the
place a little more homey.

20:47.413 --> 20:51.082
You own a mountain covered in trees
and you bought one from the store?

20:51.117 --> 20:52.783
Good point.

20:52.819 --> 20:54.919
Little late.

20:54.954 --> 20:57.622
I like this tree.

21:00.293 --> 21:02.360
- Let me help.
- Thank you.

21:07.967 --> 21:09.433
Everybody!

21:13.606 --> 21:16.974
- Not a singer?
- No.

21:17.043 --> 21:18.709
Why am I not surprised?

21:18.745 --> 21:22.313
- Want me to install this thermostat?
- Yes, please.

21:25.018 --> 21:28.486
Nice talking to ya.

21:32.392 --> 21:33.992
You know you're gonna scare the
reindeer.

21:54.781 --> 21:56.280
Okay. Here we are.

21:58.851 --> 22:00.885
It's so pretty.

22:11.264 --> 22:13.331
Welcome to the ranch.

22:13.366 --> 22:16.834
It's gorgeous.
We've been looking all over,

22:16.869 --> 22:20.504
and so far this place
checks all the boxes.

22:20.540 --> 22:24.975
This river rock is so dated.
You think we could paint it white?

22:25.011 --> 22:27.445
Well we did that back at the
Montana ranch, looked great.

22:27.480 --> 22:29.747
You own a ranch in Montana?

22:29.782 --> 22:32.450
We used to, but we just
didn't use it enough,

22:32.518 --> 22:35.486
but we've always wanted
to own a home in Alaska.

22:45.431 --> 22:48.632
I'm not sure if this barn
is big enough.

22:48.701 --> 22:51.936
Oh Alec, these are the Upsons.

22:52.004 --> 22:54.305
What kind of livestock
you planning on?

22:54.340 --> 22:55.639
Oh not livestock.

22:55.675 --> 22:57.007
I have a lot of...

22:57.043 --> 23:00.010
Well, Melissa likes
to call them toys.

23:00.079 --> 23:02.880
In Alaska, I'll need snow mobiles,
a couple boats,

23:02.915 --> 23:04.815
some off road vehicles.

23:04.884 --> 23:07.518
Back home in Connecticut he
had to build a second garage.

23:07.553 --> 23:11.856
What can I say?
I like my toys.

23:11.891 --> 23:13.290
It's plenty big enough.

23:13.326 --> 23:15.693
We just need to clear it out a
little bit.

23:15.762 --> 23:18.095
Yes, clearing out
of the barn is definitely

23:18.131 --> 23:20.131
on the to do list before the sale.

23:20.166 --> 23:22.900
That's me.

23:22.935 --> 23:25.503
Come on. Come on, fella.

23:30.476 --> 23:32.443
Bye.

23:32.478 --> 23:34.311
They leaving already?

23:34.347 --> 23:36.981
Hey, Alec, great news.

23:37.016 --> 23:39.450
They think this would make the
perfect vacation house.

23:39.485 --> 23:42.119
She kept nudging him to
stop talking,

23:42.188 --> 23:45.856
and he said they're gonna
make an offer.

23:45.892 --> 23:48.626
The plane goes up for auction
next month,

23:48.661 --> 23:50.105
and I never thought I'd be able
to say this, but...

23:50.129 --> 23:52.663
I think I'm gonna be able
to make a bid.

23:55.635 --> 23:58.035
What's wrong with you?

23:58.070 --> 24:00.182
So when you said you wanted
great people to buy the ranch,

24:00.206 --> 24:02.339
you just meant anyone who would
make an offer?

24:02.375 --> 24:03.707
What?

24:03.743 --> 24:05.154
There's nothing wrong with
the Upsons.

24:05.178 --> 24:06.677
You really think that?

24:06.712 --> 24:08.679
Sure.

24:08.714 --> 24:10.192
First they'll start with
the barn,

24:10.216 --> 24:14.051
and then they'll tear the
whole house down.

24:14.086 --> 24:15.653
Are we partners in this or not?

24:16.656 --> 24:17.755
We are.

24:18.758 --> 24:21.225
Then I vote no.

24:50.156 --> 24:51.192
Hey.

24:52.124 --> 24:54.225
Hey.

24:54.260 --> 24:56.193
You're already up.

24:56.229 --> 25:00.731
Yes I am.

25:00.800 --> 25:05.169
Well, I feel like you're about
to break up our partnership.

25:06.172 --> 25:07.271
No...

25:07.306 --> 25:10.908
No, I-I wanna be partners.

25:10.943 --> 25:14.245
I think I was so focused
on the sale,

25:14.280 --> 25:15.946
I wasn't thinking things
through.

25:16.015 --> 25:17.559
The Upsons aren't bad people,
they're...

25:17.583 --> 25:21.185
No, of course they're not, but
they're not our buyers.

25:21.220 --> 25:22.920
But I've also flown charters

25:22.955 --> 25:24.788
with people like that before and
they're...

25:24.824 --> 25:27.057
Careless?
Exactly.

25:27.093 --> 25:29.159
They're gonna get bored with
this place in a year.

25:29.228 --> 25:31.195
Maybe two, and then they're
gonna sell it

25:31.230 --> 25:33.163
without giving it a second
thought.

25:33.199 --> 25:36.867
Gus wouldn't want the place to
be empty most of the year.

25:36.903 --> 25:38.113
And he definitely wouldn't want
that fireplace

25:38.137 --> 25:39.703
to be painted white.

25:39.772 --> 25:42.673
It's just... those were Karen's
best prospects.

25:42.742 --> 25:44.642
Sorry.

25:44.677 --> 25:48.946
So... I wonder...

25:48.981 --> 25:51.549
We want to show the world

25:51.584 --> 25:53.918
how spectacular this
ranch is, right?

25:55.221 --> 25:56.720
I was talking to Tracy Walker,

25:56.789 --> 25:58.300
and she asked me about Gus's
Christmas Festival.

25:58.324 --> 25:59.456
Did you ever see it?

25:59.492 --> 26:02.793
No. Gus did talk about it,
though.

26:02.828 --> 26:05.229
It's my favourite Aurora memory.

26:05.264 --> 26:06.764
What if we revived it?

26:06.799 --> 26:09.567
What? Now?

26:09.602 --> 26:11.368
We're looking for the perfect
buyer, right?

26:11.404 --> 26:14.505
It's a great way to spread the
word and show the place off.

26:14.540 --> 26:15.873
People used to come
from all over.

26:15.942 --> 26:18.375
Plus I think it would be
really fun.

26:18.444 --> 26:20.844
The town would love it.

26:20.913 --> 26:22.713
And when would this be
happening?

26:22.748 --> 26:25.249
Okay, Christmas is in
nine days, so...

26:25.284 --> 26:26.884
It would be next Saturday,
the 23rd.

26:26.919 --> 26:28.352
Next Saturday?

26:28.387 --> 26:29.498
Ooh, I'd have to change my
flight to Florida,

26:29.522 --> 26:31.088
but I could do that.

26:31.157 --> 26:32.856
You think it's a bad idea?

26:32.892 --> 26:35.259
No, it's just a lot to do

26:35.294 --> 26:36.305
in a very short period of time.

26:36.329 --> 26:39.163
Well, we can do that. Come on!

26:40.766 --> 26:44.835
Ooh, okay, these go...

26:44.870 --> 26:48.138
okay, they go right outside the
barn next to the sleigh.

26:48.174 --> 26:51.976
We're gonna need a Santa.

26:52.011 --> 26:54.378
No... no.

26:54.447 --> 26:56.180
All right, you know what?

26:56.248 --> 26:59.316
You have neither the physique
nor the personality.

26:59.385 --> 27:02.286
My Christmas village!

27:02.355 --> 27:03.699
And we're gonna have our work
cut out for us

27:03.723 --> 27:05.356
organizing these lights.

27:05.391 --> 27:08.792
I need a great picture of
Gus. Right here!

27:12.632 --> 27:14.999
Whoa, what are you doing
with that?

27:16.769 --> 27:17.901
You'll see.

27:22.875 --> 27:24.174
Merry Christmas.

27:24.210 --> 27:25.709
Merry Christmas!

27:27.146 --> 27:28.312
You don't look very merry.

27:28.347 --> 27:30.180
This isn't my kind of thing.

27:30.249 --> 27:31.793
How long do we have to be
doing this for?

27:31.817 --> 27:34.918
Until all the flyers are gone.

27:34.954 --> 27:35.954
Samantha!

27:36.022 --> 27:37.054
Zoey!

27:37.089 --> 27:38.622
I heard you were back.

27:38.658 --> 27:40.424
Listen, stop by the dress shop.

27:40.493 --> 27:44.361
I wanna hear everything about
everything.

27:44.397 --> 27:45.629
I will.

27:45.665 --> 27:47.998
And this is fantastic!

27:48.034 --> 27:49.811
The festival was always my
favourite part of Christmas.

27:49.835 --> 27:51.669
Yeah, me too.

27:51.737 --> 27:53.737
I used to do half my shopping at
the craft booths.

27:53.773 --> 27:56.073
Those booths were great.

27:56.108 --> 27:57.919
I don't think we'll have time to
organize that this year.

27:57.943 --> 28:00.811
I know all the crafts
people in town.

28:00.846 --> 28:02.112
Let me handle the booths?

28:02.148 --> 28:03.547
That would be great!

28:03.616 --> 28:05.649
I'm happy to help!
So good to see you.

28:05.685 --> 28:07.818
Thanks.

28:07.853 --> 28:09.753
That's huge.

28:09.789 --> 28:10.888
Merry Christmas.

28:12.858 --> 28:13.891
Tracy!

28:13.926 --> 28:15.759
Hey!

28:15.828 --> 28:19.797
So you're gonna be in town long
enough after all.

28:19.832 --> 28:21.265
You kind of inspired me.

28:21.300 --> 28:22.866
I'm so glad.

28:22.935 --> 28:24.613
I mean, the festival was always
the heart of this town.

28:24.637 --> 28:26.503
Things just weren't the same
after it stopped.

28:26.572 --> 28:29.606
You're doing a wonderful thing.

28:29.642 --> 28:32.843
And so are you.!

28:32.878 --> 28:34.645
Bye!

28:34.680 --> 28:36.146
My ninth grade teacher.

28:36.182 --> 28:37.881
She's a hugger.

28:37.950 --> 28:39.349
I noticed.

28:42.321 --> 28:44.121
This makes me so happy.

28:44.156 --> 28:45.923
Can Brock and me be in
charge of food?

28:45.958 --> 28:49.793
Ooh, I'd have to check with my
planning partner here.

28:49.862 --> 28:52.329
Yes... yes.

28:53.365 --> 28:55.165
Geoff Peters!

28:55.201 --> 28:57.234
Zoey!

28:57.269 --> 28:58.602
Hi!

28:58.637 --> 28:59.603
It's great to see you.

28:59.638 --> 29:00.904
You too!

29:00.940 --> 29:02.473
Oh man.

29:02.508 --> 29:03.674
How's Gus's plane?

29:03.743 --> 29:05.075
She's a beauty.

29:05.111 --> 29:06.922
I'm covering Gus's old delivery
route everyday.

29:06.946 --> 29:07.878
She's steady as can be.

29:07.913 --> 29:08.913
That's great.

29:08.948 --> 29:10.180
Geoff, aren't you supposed

29:10.216 --> 29:11.181
to be on your mail run
right now?

29:11.217 --> 29:12.649
Yeah, about that.

29:12.685 --> 29:14.529
That reindeer of Gus's shut the
air strip again.

29:14.553 --> 29:16.286
And it's your reindeer now,
right?

29:16.322 --> 29:17.521
Yeah, wait...

29:17.590 --> 29:18.967
You said Palmer had been
getting out,

29:18.991 --> 29:20.257
but the air strip's miles away.

29:20.292 --> 29:21.391
We gotta go get him.

29:23.062 --> 29:24.294
Sorry, Geoff.
Yeah.

29:36.475 --> 29:38.275
Palmer, what are you doing here?

29:38.310 --> 29:39.910
Come on, bud, we gotta
head home.

29:42.615 --> 29:43.747
You know what?

29:43.783 --> 29:45.215
I'm kinda a city girl.

29:45.251 --> 29:48.051
Reindeer wrangling isn't really
my department.

29:48.087 --> 29:49.820
What's the protocol here?

29:49.855 --> 29:51.655
Do you... do you get
nervous if I...

29:51.690 --> 29:54.458
Come a little bit towards you?
No, okay.

29:54.493 --> 29:58.228
I'm gonna go back and see if
Alec has gotten here yet...

29:58.264 --> 29:59.730
You okay?

29:59.765 --> 30:00.876
I wasn't talking to a reindeer.

30:00.900 --> 30:02.533
Palmer?

30:04.670 --> 30:06.136
Palmer, come here buddy.

30:06.172 --> 30:08.906
Come here, it's okay.

30:08.974 --> 30:11.108
Hey, it's okay, buddy.

30:11.143 --> 30:13.977
Well, you made that look easy.

30:15.948 --> 30:18.448
Yeah, lots of practice.

30:18.484 --> 30:21.385
So he's been to this airstrip
before?

30:21.420 --> 30:24.054
Yeah, last month.

30:24.089 --> 30:25.956
Why does he keep coming back
here?

30:25.991 --> 30:27.724
I have no idea.

30:27.793 --> 30:30.294
Good, you got him.

30:30.329 --> 30:32.095
Zoey Hathaway!

30:32.131 --> 30:33.096
Chuck.

30:33.132 --> 30:36.366
Merry Christmas, and...

30:36.402 --> 30:38.135
welcome back to Aurora.

30:38.204 --> 30:40.704
Thanks, how's the airstrip
these days?

30:40.739 --> 30:42.306
The airstrips better than ever.

30:42.341 --> 30:45.776
It's just my knees.
They're getting a little creaky,

30:45.811 --> 30:48.679
but after 40 years on the job,
well, I don't blame 'em.

30:48.747 --> 30:52.749
Come on inside, I need to
talk to you.

30:52.785 --> 30:54.318
Sure, yeah, you got it.

30:54.386 --> 30:56.620
We'll be right back.

30:56.689 --> 30:58.889
You're the legal owner of the
reindeer now, right?

30:58.924 --> 31:00.424
Right.

31:00.492 --> 31:02.170
And this is the second time he's
delayed a flight.

31:02.194 --> 31:03.460
Yeah, I'm sorry about that,

31:03.495 --> 31:04.639
I'll make sure it never
happens again.

31:04.663 --> 31:06.096
Well, I'm sorry too,

31:06.131 --> 31:08.765
because with a second offence
there's a fine.

31:08.801 --> 31:11.702
The FAA does not mess around.

31:11.737 --> 31:14.071
Will that be cash or credit?

31:14.106 --> 31:17.774
Debit.

31:19.745 --> 31:22.312
Getting a lot of use these days.

31:22.348 --> 31:24.381
I'm never gonna get my plane.

31:24.450 --> 31:28.118
Sorry?
Nothing.

31:31.857 --> 31:35.025
Mom, don't worry, I will be
home for Christmas.

31:35.060 --> 31:39.029
I'm flying on standby with a
buddy pass on Christmas Eve day.

31:39.064 --> 31:40.797
You know what? I have to go,

31:40.833 --> 31:42.699
I'm making toffee for the
Christmas Festival.

31:42.768 --> 31:43.768
All right, I love you.

31:43.802 --> 31:46.303
Okay, start on the nuts.

31:46.338 --> 31:48.538
Flying on Christmas Eve is
gonna be tricky.

31:48.574 --> 31:49.873
Yeah, that's what she said.

31:49.909 --> 31:51.019
She's worried I'm not
gonna make it.

31:51.043 --> 31:52.776
She should be.
No, it'll be fine.

31:52.845 --> 31:54.811
I always spend it with them.

31:56.148 --> 31:57.948
It's my Dad.

31:57.983 --> 31:59.049
Hello.

31:59.118 --> 32:01.184
Would you stop?

32:01.253 --> 32:04.621
Listen, even if I have to hitch
a ride on Santa's sleigh,

32:04.657 --> 32:07.090
I will be home in Florida
for Christmas.

32:10.029 --> 32:12.396
Bye.
Bye.

32:21.006 --> 32:23.640
Okay, I think we did it.

32:23.709 --> 32:25.776
All right, ready to test 'em?

32:25.811 --> 32:29.446
Yes.
Okay.

32:29.515 --> 32:32.349
Hey! That looks great!

32:33.953 --> 32:35.452
Ooh.

32:35.487 --> 32:37.621
Wait, what just happened?

32:37.656 --> 32:39.122
We just blew the generator.

32:39.158 --> 32:40.757
No!

32:41.760 --> 32:42.893
Yeah...

32:47.833 --> 32:49.866
I need a new generator.

32:49.902 --> 32:51.335
No problem.

32:51.370 --> 32:53.136
And 500 strings of Christmas
lights.

32:53.172 --> 32:55.038
That could be a problem.

32:55.107 --> 32:56.551
I don't have that many lights
at the store.

32:56.575 --> 32:59.576
I mean we got what you
need in Fairbanks,

32:59.611 --> 33:00.922
but it wouldn't be here until
after Christmas.

33:00.946 --> 33:02.779
Well, can they be overnighted?

33:02.815 --> 33:05.282
We could send a truck but...

33:05.351 --> 33:07.417
it's gonna cost ya... a lot.

33:07.486 --> 33:09.619
Well, I've gotta have them.

33:09.655 --> 33:11.054
Here you go.

33:14.026 --> 33:17.227
My plane fund, it's getting
emptier and emptier.

33:17.262 --> 33:19.930
Do you have to put on the
festival?

33:19.965 --> 33:21.732
I know people are looking
forward to it.

33:21.767 --> 33:23.900
I'm putting it on so that people
can see the property.

33:23.936 --> 33:25.268
If they come from out of town,

33:25.337 --> 33:28.338
they'll see Aurora at it's best.

33:28.374 --> 33:30.507
I love this place.

33:30.542 --> 33:33.443
I Forgot how much I missed
everyone here.

33:33.479 --> 33:36.146
Thanks, Otto.

33:36.215 --> 33:39.116
So what time does the barn dance
start after the festival?

33:39.184 --> 33:40.617
I forgot about the barn dance!

33:40.686 --> 33:42.319
You gotta have a dance.

33:42.354 --> 33:46.490
You know Gus and Ida used
to always have Santa

33:46.525 --> 33:49.026
in the sleighs, lights in
the trees,

33:49.094 --> 33:51.495
and that big Christmas star on
top of the ranch house.

33:51.530 --> 33:52.963
I haven't even seen that star.

33:52.998 --> 33:54.398
You've gotta find it.

33:54.433 --> 33:56.600
But most of all, you've gotta
finish off

33:56.635 --> 33:57.601
with a big barn dance.

33:57.636 --> 33:59.369
I mean we have to celebrate.

33:59.405 --> 34:01.772
Otto is a big grump all year,

34:01.807 --> 34:04.141
but at Christmas he's like a
little kid.

34:04.176 --> 34:05.876
I am not a grump.

34:05.944 --> 34:07.844
You know that barn floor is not
in good shape.

34:07.880 --> 34:10.313
There's reindeer living
in there.

34:10.349 --> 34:11.592
The reindeer are the guests
of honour.

34:11.617 --> 34:14.051
Otto's got an answer
for everything.

34:14.085 --> 34:17.954
I wish I did.

34:18.023 --> 34:19.389
I'm back.

34:19.425 --> 34:21.891
Do not tell me you need
more lights.

34:21.960 --> 34:23.827
You are gonna outshine the
Aurora Borealis.

34:23.862 --> 34:26.696
No, do you have any wide plank
oak flooring?

34:26.764 --> 34:28.398
I need to fix the barn
floor fast.

34:28.434 --> 34:29.800
For the barn dance?

34:29.835 --> 34:32.101
Everybody's looking
forward to it.

34:32.137 --> 34:33.637
Yeah, I have plenty of
wide plank oak.

34:33.705 --> 34:35.038
It's a little spendy.

34:35.074 --> 34:37.741
Of course it is.

34:37.775 --> 34:39.509
So I was wondering...

34:39.545 --> 34:42.012
The hardware store used to do
this Christmas ring toss booth,

34:42.047 --> 34:45.081
and it's for little kids, but...

34:45.117 --> 34:46.315
You know, it's really fun.

34:46.351 --> 34:49.619
I remember that.

34:49.655 --> 34:52.556
Any chance you'd wanna organize
that for the festival?

34:52.591 --> 34:54.157
Really? You're sure?

34:54.193 --> 34:55.592
Yes, I'm sure.

34:55.661 --> 34:59.029
Yeah, yeah, I could do that.

34:59.064 --> 35:02.566
Cool.
Great.

35:09.942 --> 35:11.341
Where are the Christmas lights?

35:11.376 --> 35:12.821
They're coming on the
truck tomorrow.

35:12.845 --> 35:16.746
And these are boards for
the barn.

35:16.782 --> 35:19.249
There's gonna be a dance.

35:19.284 --> 35:21.585
I know it's getting bigger
and bigger,

35:21.620 --> 35:23.987
but I really appreciate all
your work.

35:24.022 --> 35:27.691
I don't mind, I kinda feel like
I'm doing it for Gus.

35:27.726 --> 35:29.860
He was sad that he had to stop
the festival.

35:29.928 --> 35:31.840
He always said someday he would
start it up again.

35:31.864 --> 35:33.930
I guess someday is now.

35:33.966 --> 35:37.067
You know there used to be
this big star

35:37.102 --> 35:39.402
that all the kids would make
wishes on.

35:39.438 --> 35:40.871
Do you know what happened
to that?

35:40.906 --> 35:42.706
Yeah, he lent it to a church
in Greenville

35:42.741 --> 35:43.741
a couple of years ago.

35:43.809 --> 35:44.819
You think we could get it back?

35:44.843 --> 35:46.877
It's 150 miles away.

35:46.945 --> 35:48.345
So we could drive that.

35:48.380 --> 35:49.813
And the pass is already snowed
in.

35:49.848 --> 35:51.314
So we can't drive that.

35:51.350 --> 35:52.716
No.

35:52.751 --> 35:55.585
Well, I guess we can't have
everything.

35:55.621 --> 35:57.341
All right, I've got this guy,
you got those.

35:58.357 --> 35:59.856
After you.
Thank you.

36:04.830 --> 36:09.332
And house supplies, flooring.

36:09.401 --> 36:11.668
There's the lights.

36:11.703 --> 36:14.471
FAA fine equals...

36:16.909 --> 36:20.877
So the Hathaway charter fund
is not looking good.

36:28.086 --> 36:29.052
And we're finished.

36:29.087 --> 36:30.620
All right, thanks for the help.

36:30.656 --> 36:33.123
Yeah, no problem. And you got a
couple boards left over.

36:33.192 --> 36:35.325
That's all right, I'll just
throw 'em in the cabin.

36:35.360 --> 36:37.928
You know I'm surprised how much
I'm liking that cabin.

36:37.963 --> 36:42.265
I've always said, living outside
in a tent is the way to go.

36:42.301 --> 36:45.802
Having a roof over my head and
a nice comfy bed...

36:45.837 --> 36:47.070
Pretty nice.

36:47.105 --> 36:49.940
You think that means I'm
getting old?

36:49.975 --> 36:52.108
Yeah, it does.

36:52.177 --> 36:54.911
You didn't have to be
that honest.

36:54.980 --> 36:56.513
Hey, look at you.

36:56.548 --> 36:59.382
One dance floor ready to go.

36:59.451 --> 37:01.262
Well good, 'cause they just
delivered 500 strings

37:01.286 --> 37:03.486
of Christmas lights and a
generator.

37:03.522 --> 37:04.754
Do you wanna help?

37:04.790 --> 37:06.923
We've got 27 trees that
need lighting.

37:06.959 --> 37:10.360
Oh no, I gotta get back to
the diner.

37:10.395 --> 37:12.095
Yeah, you kids have fun.

37:12.164 --> 37:13.263
All right.

37:13.332 --> 37:15.699
Lazy!
I know, right?

37:15.734 --> 37:20.270
There's years of happiness in
Gus and Ida's trees.

37:20.305 --> 37:22.572
This is the longest I've been
earth bound

37:22.608 --> 37:24.874
since I got my license.

37:24.910 --> 37:27.010
I gotta get up in the air.

37:27.045 --> 37:28.578
I like my feet on the ground.

37:28.614 --> 37:30.814
Never been in a plane in my life.
What?!

37:30.849 --> 37:33.550
How'd you get to Alaska?

37:33.585 --> 37:36.386
They got these things
called "roads".

37:36.455 --> 37:38.922
I gotta get you up in the sky.

37:38.957 --> 37:40.657
Yeah... No thanks.

37:40.726 --> 37:45.061
All right, it'd be you and me
in the cockpit,

37:45.097 --> 37:46.997
we'd have the whole sky in
front of us.

37:47.032 --> 37:50.900
It's the best feeling
in the world.

37:50.969 --> 37:52.702
Thank you.
Here you go.

37:52.738 --> 37:54.337
So how long you been in Alaska?

37:54.373 --> 37:57.140
Seven years now.

37:57.175 --> 37:58.608
Never stayed in one place much

37:58.644 --> 37:59.954
until I started spending winters
here with Gus.

37:59.978 --> 38:02.078
Where were you before that?

38:02.114 --> 38:03.358
All over, but I'd spend the rest
of the year

38:03.382 --> 38:04.392
at a glacier tour company.

38:04.416 --> 38:06.750
Ooh, that sounds interesting.

38:06.818 --> 38:10.020
Cold.
Yes, it was.

38:10.055 --> 38:13.490
Gus used to say if I spent
one more year there,

38:13.525 --> 38:15.091
I'd be Alec the snowman.

38:15.127 --> 38:17.961
I can just hear him saying that.

38:17.996 --> 38:20.930
Yeah, he was a good man.

38:20.966 --> 38:23.033
He was the best.

38:24.036 --> 38:25.079
He always made me feel welcome.

38:25.103 --> 38:28.738
Like he was happy I was here.

38:28.807 --> 38:31.508
I don't know, there's something
about this ranch, just...

38:31.543 --> 38:33.310
it almost feels like...

38:33.345 --> 38:35.512
Home.

38:35.580 --> 38:37.147
Yeah.

38:37.215 --> 38:40.216
Which is strange because
"home" is a word

38:40.252 --> 38:43.253
I never thought I'd care
about, but...

38:43.322 --> 38:45.522
Maybe I do.

38:45.557 --> 38:48.058
You know, I feel the same way.

38:48.126 --> 38:49.793
Brock and Anya...

38:49.828 --> 38:52.162
I think they think I lead this
glamorous life,

38:52.197 --> 38:54.731
but... actually it can be a
little lonely.

38:54.766 --> 38:57.200
Really?

38:57.235 --> 38:58.735
I figured you had loads
of friends.

38:58.770 --> 39:00.437
No, I do, I do...

39:00.505 --> 39:04.374
I mean, no one as close as Anya,
she's... she's like family.

39:04.409 --> 39:08.178
But I guess in Aurora,

39:08.213 --> 39:12.549
it's hard to be lonely, because
I know everybody...

39:12.584 --> 39:14.217
and everybody knows me.

39:14.252 --> 39:15.719
Yeah.

39:15.754 --> 39:17.195
To Aurora.

39:18.023 --> 39:19.222
To Aurora.

39:21.393 --> 39:23.460
All right, ready?

39:23.495 --> 39:25.128
Ready.

39:30.335 --> 39:32.635
I love it.

39:32.704 --> 39:34.704
I gotta get a picture.

39:38.643 --> 39:40.510
You know what?

39:40.545 --> 39:41.978
It's better in person.

39:42.013 --> 39:45.181
Yeah, let me...
try with this.

39:45.250 --> 39:46.649
You brought your camera?

39:46.685 --> 39:48.785
Of course.

39:48.820 --> 39:50.720
Wait. Say cheese.

39:50.756 --> 39:52.021
No, not me!

39:52.057 --> 39:53.423
No, get the trees, don't get me.

39:53.458 --> 39:55.992
Okay, okay, I'll get the trees.

39:56.027 --> 39:57.694
No, stop, stop,

39:57.729 --> 39:59.462
I don't want you
to get me, stop!

39:59.498 --> 40:00.730
No, that's perfect.

40:00.799 --> 40:02.832
Stop it, I mean it, stop!

40:02.868 --> 40:04.467
Okay.

40:05.971 --> 40:09.072
That's actually really nice.

40:09.107 --> 40:11.174
That is good.

40:11.209 --> 40:12.409
Will you send that to me?

40:12.444 --> 40:13.777
I want to send a copy
to my folks.

40:13.845 --> 40:15.245
Of course.

40:15.313 --> 40:17.714
You know, this is the first time

40:17.783 --> 40:20.116
I've ever decorated
a Christmas tree.

40:20.152 --> 40:21.951
You gotta be kidding.

40:21.987 --> 40:23.920
No.

40:23.955 --> 40:25.989
My mom died when I was a baby,

40:26.057 --> 40:29.426
and my dad wasn't exactly
a decorations guy.

40:29.461 --> 40:31.394
You know, I look back on it,

40:31.430 --> 40:33.496
and I think Christmas
probably made him really sad

40:33.532 --> 40:35.031
and miss my mom.

40:35.066 --> 40:38.001
But, he always got me a present.

40:38.036 --> 40:40.103
One year, he got me a camera.

40:40.138 --> 40:42.116
It was nothin' fancy,
just a little point-and-shoot,

40:42.140 --> 40:45.041
but I thought it was the
greatest thing in the world.

40:45.076 --> 40:48.044
I was a pretty quiet kid,
and my dad said,

40:48.079 --> 40:51.147
"You should let the pictures do
the talking for ya".

40:51.183 --> 40:52.549
And you know what?
He was right.

40:52.584 --> 40:54.884
I really got into it.

40:54.953 --> 40:56.386
Sounds like a smart man.

40:56.455 --> 40:58.488
He was.

40:58.523 --> 41:01.090
So, what about you?

41:01.126 --> 41:02.892
What's your favourite
Christmas present?

41:02.928 --> 41:05.295
Flying lessons.

41:05.363 --> 41:07.397
14 years old.

41:07.432 --> 41:09.699
Made my parents nervous, but...

41:09.734 --> 41:12.402
They knew it was what
I really wanted.

41:22.948 --> 41:25.582
Well, here's my stop.

41:25.617 --> 41:27.684
Yeah.

41:29.020 --> 41:30.338
Good night.

41:31.223 --> 41:33.690
Good night.

41:39.564 --> 41:40.797
Hello?

41:40.866 --> 41:43.500
Zoey, I have some promising
news.

41:43.535 --> 41:44.934
What is it?

41:45.003 --> 41:46.503
<i>Well, there's a boutique
hotel firm</i>

41:46.538 --> 41:47.648
that scoped out the property
a couple years ago.

41:47.672 --> 41:48.850
Gus thought about their offer,

41:48.874 --> 41:50.006
<i>but he decided not to sell.</i>

41:50.041 --> 41:51.608
I'm surprised he thought
about it.

41:51.643 --> 41:53.321
Well, they're very good people,
and he was tempted,

41:53.345 --> 41:54.944
but anyway, they contacted me

41:54.980 --> 41:56.357
<i>and they wanna arrange
a meeting with you.</i>

41:56.381 --> 41:58.114
A hotel firm?

41:58.149 --> 42:00.328
Well, this might be your last
serious offer before spring,

42:00.352 --> 42:01.562
<i>it doesn't hurt to talk to them.</i>

42:01.586 --> 42:03.887
Alright. Thank you.

43:39.551 --> 43:40.950
Hey, Ginny, sorry to bother you.

43:40.986 --> 43:42.685
Can I speak to Geoff
for a minute, please?

43:42.754 --> 43:45.722
Sure, Alec. Geoff?

43:45.757 --> 43:47.223
Hey, Alec.
Hey.

43:47.258 --> 43:48.458
What's up, man?

43:48.526 --> 43:50.026
I need a favour.

43:50.061 --> 43:52.528
Yeah, sure.

44:00.505 --> 44:02.238
Hello?

44:02.273 --> 44:04.674
<i>Hi, Zoey, I'm sorry to call
at the crack of dawn,</i>

44:04.709 --> 44:07.810
but our pilot Geoff Peters
can't make it in today,

44:07.846 --> 44:10.146
and I'm desperate for
a substitute,

44:10.181 --> 44:12.215
<i>so I was wondering if maybe...</i>

44:12.283 --> 44:14.317
I'll do it, I can do it!
I'll do it!

44:25.497 --> 44:26.996
Hey.
Hey.

44:27.032 --> 44:28.197
Come on in.

44:28.233 --> 44:30.633
Thanks.

44:30.669 --> 44:32.079
They need me at the airfield
right away,

44:32.103 --> 44:33.436
but my jeep won't start.

44:33.471 --> 44:37.173
Do you wanna borrow my truck?

44:37.242 --> 44:38.908
Any way I could borrow
your bike?

44:38.943 --> 44:40.576
It'd be so much faster,

44:40.612 --> 44:43.346
I could take the trail
instead of the main road.

44:43.381 --> 44:45.248
I told you I can drive anything.

44:45.316 --> 44:48.718
Yeah, it's just the trails are
a little icy this time of year.

44:48.787 --> 44:50.297
Here, let me take you.
I'll grab my jacket.

44:50.321 --> 44:53.756
That would be great, thank you.

44:53.792 --> 44:56.092
Did you take these pictures?

44:56.127 --> 44:58.628
Yeah.

44:58.697 --> 45:01.230
I thought it looked a little
bare in here.

45:01.266 --> 45:02.565
Here.

45:02.600 --> 45:05.468
They're good,
people should see them.

45:05.503 --> 45:07.704
They're just for fun.

45:07.772 --> 45:09.272
Okay, let's get going.

45:09.307 --> 45:10.907
Okay.

45:10.942 --> 45:12.141
Thank you.

45:12.177 --> 45:14.544
You're welcome.

45:23.054 --> 45:24.220
You okay?

45:24.289 --> 45:25.521
Yeah.

45:46.478 --> 45:47.944
Thanks for the ride.

45:47.979 --> 45:50.813
I'll pick you up.
What time?

45:50.882 --> 45:53.583
I don't know, come on
in, we'll check with Chuck.

45:56.421 --> 46:00.656
Zoey, you are gonna be one
popular person today.

46:00.692 --> 46:02.658
See, it's the last big
postal service delivery

46:02.694 --> 46:04.093
before Christmas

46:04.129 --> 46:06.562
and you've got six towns
on your route.

46:06.598 --> 46:10.433
Now, the planes are loaded
and itinerary's right here.

46:10.468 --> 46:13.336
You're gonna be surprised how
many boxes are on board,

46:13.371 --> 46:15.738
so it's a good thing
you brought a helper.

46:15.807 --> 46:17.140
No.

46:17.175 --> 46:19.976
No, I'm staying here
on the ground.

46:20.011 --> 46:24.080
Come on, you'll have a front row
seat to the whole sky.

46:24.115 --> 46:27.049
Someone's gotta be here to feed
the reindeer at six,

46:27.085 --> 46:28.684
so I should just go.

46:28.720 --> 46:30.553
I can call Brock
and have him do that.

46:30.588 --> 46:32.488
You could take pictures
from the plane.

46:37.028 --> 46:38.761
Alec?

46:38.797 --> 46:41.464
Zoey, people who don't
like to fly

46:41.499 --> 46:43.933
really, really don't like
to fly.

46:43.968 --> 46:45.868
Me? Hey, I'm a flyer,

46:45.904 --> 46:47.870
and when I retire
that's all I'm gonna do.

46:47.906 --> 46:51.007
Come on, you're never gonna
retire, you love this job.

46:51.042 --> 46:52.875
I'm retiring at the end
of the month.

46:52.911 --> 46:56.646
I can't imagine this place
without you.

46:58.316 --> 47:00.750
Well, look who's a flyer,
after all.

47:00.785 --> 47:03.252
Let's do this.

47:11.696 --> 47:13.696
You really think
that's gonna help?

47:13.731 --> 47:16.499
Got your eyes open, didn't it?

47:18.102 --> 47:19.735
All right, now look down.

47:19.771 --> 47:23.472
You won't regret it, promise.

47:33.351 --> 47:35.451
That's beautiful.

47:40.124 --> 47:42.625
<i>Cessna 714 X-Ray Delta,</i>

47:42.694 --> 47:46.062
<i>I do wanna remind you, you are
currently on an open channel.</i>

47:49.300 --> 47:52.668
Yeah, dully noted,
Aurora Unicom.

48:01.512 --> 48:03.579
Maybe this isn't so bad.

48:03.615 --> 48:05.748
Isn't so bad?

48:05.817 --> 48:08.284
Come on, this is the best.

48:09.988 --> 48:11.654
So, why do you love flying
so much?

48:11.689 --> 48:15.157
Well, it's hard to put
into words,

48:15.226 --> 48:20.162
but I've loved being in the air
since my first lesson with Gus.

48:21.833 --> 48:25.801
I knew right away the sky
is where I belong.

48:31.309 --> 48:32.808
See that?

48:32.844 --> 48:34.043
Yeah.

48:34.078 --> 48:36.946
Flying makes me feel
like I'm alive.

48:53.131 --> 48:54.630
Next up?

48:54.699 --> 48:56.832
Yeah, they brought flu vaccine,
thank you so much.

49:03.007 --> 49:04.774
Thank you so much,
Merry Christmas.

49:04.809 --> 49:07.276
Have a good one.

49:10.048 --> 49:11.814
Can't tell you how happy I am
to get these.

49:11.883 --> 49:13.616
We're delivering them tonight.

49:13.685 --> 49:15.384
What are they?

49:15.420 --> 49:16.986
Us troopers all chip in

49:17.021 --> 49:20.690
to make sure every kid in
the district gets a present.

49:20.725 --> 49:22.992
Everything okay?

49:23.027 --> 49:24.994
The company said
wrapping included,

49:25.029 --> 49:27.074
I thought that meant the
presents were gonna be wrapped.

49:27.098 --> 49:28.898
I'll never get these done
in time.

49:28.933 --> 49:30.766
Wait, wait, we only have
one more stop.

49:30.802 --> 49:32.001
Do you want us to help you?

49:32.036 --> 49:33.769
Thank you.

49:33.838 --> 49:36.238
I'll show you how it's done.

49:40.845 --> 49:42.411
How are you so good at this?

49:42.447 --> 49:44.124
You're the guy that never had
a Christmas tree.

49:44.148 --> 49:45.614
You never had a Christmas tree?

49:45.650 --> 49:47.316
It's a long story.

49:47.385 --> 49:48.884
I've had a lot of jobs.

49:48.920 --> 49:50.853
One Christmas, I worked
for a mail-order company.

49:50.888 --> 49:52.833
When you get paid by the
package, you learn to be quick.

49:52.857 --> 49:55.324
Never a dull moment
with this one.

49:59.764 --> 50:01.524
All right, so our last stop
is in Greenville,

50:01.566 --> 50:04.433
but it doesn't say what it is.

50:07.772 --> 50:10.239
Do you know something
about this?

50:24.455 --> 50:26.333
Reverend said he'd leave it
for us in his locker.

50:26.357 --> 50:27.556
Leave what?

50:27.592 --> 50:30.059
Open it and find out.

50:37.802 --> 50:40.302
Gus's Christmas star.

50:40.338 --> 50:42.571
Now you have everything
you need.

50:55.019 --> 50:57.553
Thank you for getting me
the star.

50:57.588 --> 51:00.156
I just made a couple of calls.

51:01.859 --> 51:04.927
That's not all you did.

51:04.996 --> 51:06.429
It wasn't a coincidence

51:06.497 --> 51:10.166
that Geoff didn't come
into work today.

51:10.201 --> 51:12.301
Did you talk to him?

51:12.336 --> 51:13.736
You got me the Christmas tree,

51:13.771 --> 51:16.305
I wanted to get you something,
too.

51:17.809 --> 51:20.276
Well, thank you.

51:22.947 --> 51:25.981
Alec, get your camera.

51:26.017 --> 51:28.117
What's happening?

51:28.152 --> 51:30.453
Look.

51:30.488 --> 51:32.988
It's magic.

51:34.792 --> 51:37.860
I've seen the Northern Lights
before, but...

51:37.895 --> 51:40.429
never like this.

51:48.372 --> 51:50.473
Aren't you glad you came?

51:50.508 --> 51:52.975
Yes, I am.

51:58.349 --> 51:59.682
And if the lights are here,

51:59.717 --> 52:01.395
that means they're gonna be
in Aurora soon.

52:01.419 --> 52:04.820
In time for the festival,
I hope.

52:04.856 --> 52:07.323
Me too.

52:23.040 --> 52:25.341
So, how are we gonna get
that star home?

52:25.376 --> 52:26.887
I'll pick it up
from Chuck tomorrow.

52:26.911 --> 52:28.444
Okay.

52:28.479 --> 52:30.212
Whoa.

52:30.248 --> 52:33.048
Did you see that?

52:33.084 --> 52:34.717
No.

52:34.752 --> 52:36.552
I thought I saw a reindeer.

52:36.587 --> 52:38.787
You don't think Palmer would...

52:38.823 --> 52:40.022
No.

52:40.057 --> 52:41.290
I didn't see anything.

52:41.325 --> 52:42.691
Yeah.

52:42.760 --> 52:45.494
I got visions of reindeer
dancing in my head.

52:45.563 --> 52:47.263
All right.

52:47.298 --> 52:49.064
Okay.

52:57.675 --> 52:59.241
So, once I've done sorting,

52:59.277 --> 53:01.410
I'm gonna drop a box off
at the thrift shop downtown.

53:01.445 --> 53:03.490
Do you want me to take a look
at the starter on your jeep?

53:03.514 --> 53:05.181
That's okay, I already fixed it.

53:05.216 --> 53:07.349
It was just a loose connection.

53:07.385 --> 53:10.019
My truck could use an oil change
if you get the chance.

53:10.054 --> 53:11.520
I won't.

53:12.890 --> 53:14.690
Oh, my gosh, what a mess, sorry.

53:14.759 --> 53:16.125
Need some help?

53:22.767 --> 53:25.734
I can't believe he kept them
all this time.

53:25.770 --> 53:29.605
Wherever I went, I would send
Gus and Ida a postcard.

53:29.640 --> 53:32.274
Look, this is the one
I sent them

53:32.310 --> 53:33.909
when I first moved to Florida.

53:33.945 --> 53:35.811
"I'm in Tampa,
the landing was bumpy.

53:35.846 --> 53:38.747
"The pilot needed you
for a teacher, Gus.

53:38.783 --> 53:41.250
Sending love, Zoey".

53:45.890 --> 53:48.324
"Merry Christmas from Florida,
Love Zoey.

53:48.359 --> 53:52.428
P.S. I'm coming up in the summer
to visit for sure".

53:53.664 --> 53:56.599
I sent that last Christmas.

53:56.634 --> 54:00.369
I never made it up to visit him.

54:05.042 --> 54:06.709
Gus knew you loved him.

54:10.248 --> 54:12.314
He showed me this.

54:12.383 --> 54:16.418
It made him laugh.

54:16.454 --> 54:19.255
So, this is the first Christmas
I'll be in Florida,

54:19.323 --> 54:21.890
and I won't
be sending Gus a card.

54:23.160 --> 54:25.628
Thought you were staying
in Aurora?

54:25.663 --> 54:27.007
Christmas is only two days
after the festival.

54:27.031 --> 54:29.732
I have to go back Christmas Eve.

54:29.767 --> 54:31.734
It wouldn't feel like Christmas

54:31.769 --> 54:33.802
if I didn't spend it
with my parents.

54:33.871 --> 54:35.904
Right, of course.

54:35.940 --> 54:37.940
But you are coming back?

54:39.143 --> 54:42.811
You know what?
I have to work.

54:47.785 --> 54:51.553
Yeah, yeah, once this place is
sold I'm gonna be moving on too.

54:51.589 --> 54:54.023
Back to the glacier company.

54:54.058 --> 54:55.758
Yeah, they always have a spot
for me.

54:55.826 --> 54:57.993
Anyway, I'm gonna head
to the airstrip

54:58.029 --> 54:59.395
and I'm gonna get Gus's star.

54:59.463 --> 55:00.729
See you later.

55:00.798 --> 55:02.498
Okay.

55:02.533 --> 55:04.433
See ya.

55:07.638 --> 55:11.006
Hi.

55:11.042 --> 55:14.410
Well, looks like everyone's
getting back to their old lives.

55:16.380 --> 55:17.680
You know what?

55:17.715 --> 55:19.515
I wish that I could take
this whole ranch

55:19.550 --> 55:21.650
and just fly it
right back to Seattle,

55:21.686 --> 55:23.419
the whole town,

55:23.454 --> 55:26.622
but I guess I can't have
everything I want.

55:27.858 --> 55:30.359
I'm talking to a reindeer.

55:32.229 --> 55:33.429
More coffee?

55:33.497 --> 55:35.064
Sure. Thanks.

55:35.132 --> 55:36.332
You look depressed.

55:36.367 --> 55:38.801
I'm not depressed.

55:44.975 --> 55:46.642
Alec looks depressed.

55:46.711 --> 55:48.177
He always looks depressed.

55:48.212 --> 55:49.745
Not since he's been working
with Zoey.

55:49.780 --> 55:51.080
You need to go talk to him.

55:51.148 --> 55:52.348
No, honey.

55:52.383 --> 55:54.183
Now.

55:55.986 --> 55:57.152
Hey, how's it going?

55:57.188 --> 55:59.488
Getting ready for the big
shindig?

55:59.523 --> 56:01.323
Yeah.

56:01.392 --> 56:02.658
Good, good.

56:02.727 --> 56:04.293
It's nice of Zoey to bring
that back.

56:04.362 --> 56:06.595
Anya asked you to come over
here, didn't she?

56:06.664 --> 56:07.808
Yeah, I promised her I would,

56:07.832 --> 56:09.264
but you don't have to say
anything.

56:09.333 --> 56:11.400
So, did you catch any
of the hockey game last night?

56:12.636 --> 56:15.003
Tell Anya I'm fine.

56:15.039 --> 56:17.506
You don't look fine.

56:20.311 --> 56:22.378
You make good coffee, Brock.

56:22.413 --> 56:24.079
I'm gonna miss it.

56:24.115 --> 56:25.826
In fact, there's a lot of things
I'm gonna miss about Aurora.

56:25.850 --> 56:27.349
Just because Zoey's
selling the ranch

56:27.385 --> 56:29.084
doesn't mean you have
to go anywhere.

56:29.153 --> 56:31.320
I'm sure we could find a roof
and a bed for you

56:31.355 --> 56:32.855
somewhere in town.

56:32.923 --> 56:36.258
I hear that's important
to old people like you.

56:36.293 --> 56:39.762
No, soon enough I'll be sleeping
in my favourite tent.

56:41.432 --> 56:43.832
Thanks for the coffee.

56:44.835 --> 56:46.235
See ya.
See ya.

56:49.073 --> 56:50.973
What did you guys talk about?

56:51.008 --> 56:52.508
Hockey.

57:01.352 --> 57:02.518
Merry Christmas, Zoey.

57:02.553 --> 57:03.752
Merry Christmas.

57:03.821 --> 57:05.031
Zoey, so excited
for the festival.

57:05.055 --> 57:06.221
Yeah, it's in three days.

57:06.290 --> 57:07.556
Can't wait!

57:07.625 --> 57:08.924
Merry Christmas.

57:08.959 --> 57:10.592
Merry Christmas.
Hi, Zoey.

57:10.628 --> 57:12.761
She had a lot of shopping bags.

57:12.797 --> 57:14.396
Yeah, she has five daughters

57:14.432 --> 57:16.765
and she was buying them all
dresses for the dance.

57:16.801 --> 57:18.534
What are you wearing?

57:18.569 --> 57:21.069
I have a sweet little dress
from my parents for Christmas.

57:21.105 --> 57:22.471
I'll wear that.

57:22.506 --> 57:24.072
It's nothing fancy,
but it'll work.

57:24.141 --> 57:26.175
It's a party,
you need a party dress.

57:27.778 --> 57:30.679
Like that one.

57:30.748 --> 57:32.948
I do like red.

57:32.983 --> 57:34.216
Come on.

57:34.251 --> 57:36.051
Try it on.

57:36.086 --> 57:37.352
Okay.

57:45.029 --> 57:46.361
Hi, you want me to come in?

57:46.430 --> 57:48.997
Okay.

57:49.066 --> 57:50.299
What's going on?

57:50.334 --> 57:51.574
I spoke with the hotel company.

57:51.602 --> 57:53.013
Can we meet at the ranch
tomorrow morning?

57:53.037 --> 57:54.670
Sure.

57:57.208 --> 58:00.642
So, if you decide to sell us
this beautiful property,

58:00.678 --> 58:02.978
this is what we propose.

58:06.116 --> 58:08.917
<i>Guests will check
in at the ranch house</i>

58:08.953 --> 58:11.353
<i>and stay in one
of 12 unique bungalows.</i>

58:11.388 --> 58:13.255
<i>Each bungalow will have
its own character</i>

58:13.290 --> 58:14.756
<i>and a spectacular view.</i>

58:14.825 --> 58:16.465
<i>People will come from all over
the world</i>

58:16.494 --> 58:18.660
<i>to see the Aurora Borealis
in all its glory.</i>

58:18.696 --> 58:21.363
Can you pause it, please?

58:21.432 --> 58:23.165
Gus and Ida's trees are missing.

58:23.200 --> 58:26.969
We wanted to make room
for that spectacular view.

58:27.004 --> 58:29.071
The trees have sentimental
value.

58:29.106 --> 58:31.084
Is there any way that maybe
they can be transplanted?

58:31.108 --> 58:33.041
I'll look into it.

58:33.077 --> 58:35.210
Okay, this ranch
is really special,

58:35.246 --> 58:37.880
so we're gonna need to find
a buyer who understands that.

58:37.948 --> 58:39.681
I agree.

58:39.717 --> 58:42.150
This place is special and we do
want to preserve what's here,

58:42.186 --> 58:44.820
so, let me talk to my team

58:44.889 --> 58:48.690
and I will get back to you with
a revised proposal and an offer?

58:50.027 --> 58:51.426
Sorry.

58:51.495 --> 58:53.028
Great.

58:53.063 --> 58:54.830
Well, wait and see
what they have to say.

58:54.865 --> 58:57.833
Yeah, I guess you're right.

59:01.338 --> 59:03.572
I was sure you'd be against
the sale.

59:03.607 --> 59:06.608
I think she meant what she said
about preserving the land.

59:06.677 --> 59:09.745
And the trees could always
be moved.

59:09.780 --> 59:11.880
But Gus planted those trees
with Ida.

59:11.916 --> 59:13.482
I know.

59:13.517 --> 59:15.317
Sometimes,
things have to change.

59:15.352 --> 59:17.853
Hey, and if they buy it,

59:17.922 --> 59:20.556
you might get the money in time
for the plane sale.

59:20.591 --> 59:22.758
Then, I'm about ready to head
out into the wild.

59:22.793 --> 59:25.694
Aren't you worried about turning
into Alec the snowman?

59:25.729 --> 59:28.397
No, I'll be fine.

59:28.432 --> 59:30.999
And hey, if they do buy it,

59:31.035 --> 59:34.036
you won't have to put on
the festival, after all.

59:34.104 --> 59:37.839
I know, but I want to do it.

59:37.908 --> 59:40.208
I think people would
really love it,

59:40.244 --> 59:41.977
and I love Aurora.

59:42.046 --> 59:46.548
So, it would be like giving
everybody a gift before I go.

59:48.252 --> 59:51.353
But, listen, this means a lot
of extra work for you too,

59:51.388 --> 59:55.123
so it can't just be my decision.

59:56.660 --> 59:59.895
I think it would make Gus happy.

59:59.930 --> 01:00:02.397
Let's do it for Gus.

01:00:05.169 --> 01:00:06.468
Well, remind me to tell Zoey

01:00:06.503 --> 01:00:07.847
that Otto's gonna play Santa
tomorrow.

01:00:07.871 --> 01:00:10.072
Better him than me.

01:00:10.107 --> 01:00:12.507
That should do it.

01:00:15.879 --> 01:00:18.647
I hate the idea of moving
the trees,

01:00:18.682 --> 01:00:20.949
and I haven't even found
homes for the reindeer yet.

01:00:20.985 --> 01:00:22.684
Maybe you and Alec
could run the ranch

01:00:22.753 --> 01:00:23.986
as a bed and breakfast.

01:00:24.054 --> 01:00:25.954
I'm going home, remember?

01:00:25.990 --> 01:00:28.056
And Alec wants to get back
to the wild.

01:00:29.426 --> 01:00:31.927
It's too bad,
you guys seem good together.

01:00:31.996 --> 01:00:34.496
Anyway, opening a B&B
feels like your dream.

01:00:34.531 --> 01:00:36.331
Flying.

01:00:36.367 --> 01:00:37.966
Seattle's where I do that.

01:00:38.002 --> 01:00:40.502
I'm this close to owning
my own charter plane.

01:00:40.571 --> 01:00:42.738
Slow down,
you're gonna break the sifter.

01:00:42.773 --> 01:00:44.640
Sorry.

01:00:44.708 --> 01:00:47.342
Oh, my God, I forgot the cookie
cutter for the gingerbread men!

01:00:47.378 --> 01:00:49.511
Oh, no, it's a Christmas
emergency!

01:00:49.546 --> 01:00:53.482
Don't worry,
Ida has one, I'm sure.

01:00:53.517 --> 01:00:55.851
One of these drawers.

01:00:58.522 --> 01:01:01.590
Gingerbread man...

01:01:01.625 --> 01:01:04.459
What's this?

01:01:04.528 --> 01:01:06.862
It's Ida's secret Christmas
cookie recipe!

01:01:06.897 --> 01:01:08.697
Give it to me!

01:01:08.732 --> 01:01:10.298
And the secret ingredient is...

01:01:12.202 --> 01:01:14.302
Cornflake cereal.

01:01:14.338 --> 01:01:15.537
No, it's not.

01:01:15.606 --> 01:01:17.272
Yes!

01:01:17.307 --> 01:01:18.907
No wonder she kept it a secret.

01:01:18.942 --> 01:01:20.575
I'm gonna make hundreds
of these cookies,

01:01:20.611 --> 01:01:22.678
but I want you to swear to me

01:01:22.713 --> 01:01:24.346
that you will never tell
a living soul

01:01:24.381 --> 01:01:27.482
the secret of the cornflakes.

01:01:27.518 --> 01:01:29.151
I swear it.

01:01:29.186 --> 01:01:32.054
Zoey Hathaway, it's sure nice
having you back in town.

01:01:34.525 --> 01:01:35.757
Hello?

01:01:35.793 --> 01:01:36.992
<i>Hi, Zoey,</i>

01:01:37.061 --> 01:01:39.127
your reindeer's here again.

01:01:39.196 --> 01:01:40.729
Oh, no!

01:01:51.275 --> 01:01:53.642
Well, I'm glad you're here.

01:01:53.677 --> 01:01:56.611
Palmer's down by the fence
as usual.

01:01:56.647 --> 01:01:59.047
We got one plane circling
and he can't land.

01:01:59.083 --> 01:02:02.184
Zoey, I'm afraid there's gonna
be another fine.

01:02:02.219 --> 01:02:03.752
Rules are rules.

01:02:03.821 --> 01:02:05.887
No I understand.

01:02:05.956 --> 01:02:08.423
Not your fault.

01:02:10.994 --> 01:02:14.596
Palmer, come here.

01:02:14.631 --> 01:02:16.209
He's tracked onto something
on the other side of the fence.

01:02:16.233 --> 01:02:17.866
How does he keep getting out?

01:02:17.901 --> 01:02:19.212
I'm not sure,
but it's driving me crazy.

01:02:19.236 --> 01:02:20.569
Maybe he flies.

01:02:20.604 --> 01:02:22.115
That is the best answer
we have right now.

01:02:22.139 --> 01:02:24.539
What is he seeing?

01:02:24.608 --> 01:02:28.276
I don't know,
I don't see anything.

01:02:29.613 --> 01:02:31.613
Well, where did you come from?

01:02:31.648 --> 01:02:34.349
Sadie, Sadie!

01:02:34.384 --> 01:02:35.751
Hello.

01:02:35.786 --> 01:02:37.452
Hi.

01:02:39.990 --> 01:02:41.835
Is there a reindeer convention
I didn't know about?

01:02:41.859 --> 01:02:43.658
There you are, girl.

01:02:43.694 --> 01:02:46.128
You gotta stop scaring me
like this.

01:02:46.163 --> 01:02:48.096
Sadie, she keeps coming here.

01:02:48.132 --> 01:02:50.065
Palmer keeps coming here.

01:02:50.100 --> 01:02:52.467
It's like they knew each other.

01:02:52.536 --> 01:02:54.503
Where did you get her?

01:02:54.538 --> 01:02:56.349
From a guy in Tuscola who was
moving out of state.

01:02:56.373 --> 01:02:57.906
Palmer came from Tuscola.

01:02:57.975 --> 01:03:00.776
I didn't know there were
two reindeer.

01:03:00.811 --> 01:03:03.478
They must've been a pair
that got split up.

01:03:03.514 --> 01:03:06.281
And they've been coming back
here to find each other.

01:03:06.316 --> 01:03:08.917
Aw.

01:03:08.952 --> 01:03:11.253
Any chance you've got room
for Palmer?

01:03:11.288 --> 01:03:14.189
And one more sweet old lady
named Holly.

01:03:14.224 --> 01:03:16.091
I wish I did.

01:03:16.160 --> 01:03:17.692
I've got horses and goats

01:03:17.728 --> 01:03:19.361
and barely enough room
for Sadie.

01:03:19.396 --> 01:03:20.940
My wife says if I bring home
one more animal,

01:03:20.964 --> 01:03:23.565
I gotta build a bigger barn
and a stall for me.

01:03:23.600 --> 01:03:26.601
We don't want that.

01:03:26.637 --> 01:03:29.104
Come on, girl, time to go home.

01:03:31.608 --> 01:03:33.842
Aw, don't look at me
like that, guys!

01:03:33.877 --> 01:03:37.312
You're killing me.

01:03:37.347 --> 01:03:40.282
I can't believe you
took another one.

01:03:40.317 --> 01:03:41.783
You're supposed to be
finding homes

01:03:41.819 --> 01:03:43.451
for the ones you already have.

01:03:43.487 --> 01:03:45.554
Palmer and Sadie were looking
for each other.

01:03:45.589 --> 01:03:47.055
They need to be together.

01:03:47.090 --> 01:03:50.192
Sure.

01:03:50.227 --> 01:03:51.593
Goodnight, you two.

01:03:51.662 --> 01:03:52.861
Goodnight.

01:03:52.896 --> 01:03:54.062
Night.

01:03:54.131 --> 01:03:56.331
See ya.

01:03:56.366 --> 01:03:58.300
I'm really glad
they got a happy ending.

01:03:58.335 --> 01:04:01.636
Some couples are just meant
to be, huh?

01:04:03.874 --> 01:04:05.941
We have the whole town
coming tomorrow.

01:04:05.976 --> 01:04:08.343
We still have a lot of work
to do.

01:04:08.378 --> 01:04:10.378
You ready to get up on that tree
one last time?

01:04:10.414 --> 01:04:13.949
I've been thinking
about your pictures.

01:04:13.984 --> 01:04:18.353
How would you feel if we put
them up on the wall?

01:04:20.657 --> 01:04:22.791
Yeah, I don't think so.

01:04:22.860 --> 01:04:24.893
Why not?

01:04:24.928 --> 01:04:27.863
Isn't it kinda like showing off?

01:04:27.898 --> 01:04:31.499
No, they're beautiful,
they deserve to be shown off.

01:04:31.535 --> 01:04:33.768
You really think so?

01:04:33.804 --> 01:04:36.338
I really do.

01:04:38.442 --> 01:04:40.909
Let's get back to work.

01:05:11.441 --> 01:05:12.941
I think we're ready.

01:05:12.976 --> 01:05:15.777
Yeah, so where is everybody?

01:05:15.812 --> 01:05:18.613
I don't know.

01:05:18.682 --> 01:05:20.749
Maybe I was wrong about how
excited people were.

01:05:20.784 --> 01:05:23.418
But not even Brock
and Anya are here.

01:05:23.487 --> 01:05:25.987
I know.

01:05:28.458 --> 01:05:30.759
Hey. What's going on?

01:05:30.794 --> 01:05:32.661
A giant tree just fell across
the main road.

01:05:32.729 --> 01:05:34.896
The road crew says that they
can't get it moved today.

01:05:34.932 --> 01:05:36.698
Oh, no.

01:05:36.733 --> 01:05:38.311
Well, maybe everybody
could take the trail.

01:05:38.335 --> 01:05:40.669
It's too narrow for cars,
it would take all day.

01:05:42.139 --> 01:05:45.774
We're gonna have to cancel
the festival.

01:06:01.992 --> 01:06:04.092
Oh, man!

01:06:04.127 --> 01:06:06.528
This happened the first year
I worked for Gus.

01:06:06.596 --> 01:06:08.663
It took him a week to get
the road clear.

01:06:08.732 --> 01:06:11.099
Oh, man!

01:06:11.134 --> 01:06:12.701
Feel better?

01:06:12.736 --> 01:06:14.703
Little bit.

01:06:15.939 --> 01:06:18.673
Hey, look at that.

01:06:18.709 --> 01:06:21.376
What?

01:06:21.445 --> 01:06:22.711
Hey!

01:06:22.779 --> 01:06:24.412
People coming.

01:06:24.448 --> 01:06:26.881
Hey!

01:06:32.689 --> 01:06:34.856
Hey, Zoey!

01:06:34.891 --> 01:06:37.058
We heard this party was BYOC.

01:06:37.127 --> 01:06:38.493
What does that mean?

01:06:38.528 --> 01:06:39.794
Bring your own cable.

01:06:41.932 --> 01:06:43.231
Half the town is on their way

01:06:43.266 --> 01:06:45.467
to help tow this tree
out of the road.

01:06:45.502 --> 01:06:48.370
That's right, we are not missing
this festival for anything.

01:06:48.405 --> 01:06:50.438
I love this town.

01:06:56.213 --> 01:06:58.780
Who's this now?

01:06:59.983 --> 01:07:01.916
Mom, Dad!

01:07:01.952 --> 01:07:03.551
Surprise!

01:07:05.989 --> 01:07:09.224
What are you doing here?

01:07:09.259 --> 01:07:10.636
We couldn't do Christmas
without you.

01:07:10.660 --> 01:07:11.893
We booked a flight.

01:07:11.928 --> 01:07:12.939
We were worried
you wouldn't get a seat.

01:07:12.963 --> 01:07:14.662
But you got a seat.

01:07:14.698 --> 01:07:17.265
That was no problem, nobody
flies from Florida to Alaska

01:07:17.300 --> 01:07:19.467
in the dead of winter except us.

01:07:20.804 --> 01:07:22.103
You hate the cold.

01:07:22.139 --> 01:07:23.304
Yeah, well...

01:07:23.373 --> 01:07:24.572
We love you more.

01:07:26.209 --> 01:07:28.243
Here they come!

01:07:48.298 --> 01:07:50.432
Yes!

01:07:50.467 --> 01:07:51.733
Ida never gave me the recipe.

01:07:51.768 --> 01:07:52.967
Are you gonna share?

01:07:53.003 --> 01:07:54.202
Never.

01:07:58.575 --> 01:08:00.842
When is Santa coming?

01:08:00.877 --> 01:08:02.644
Any minute now.

01:08:02.679 --> 01:08:04.813
Are you sure?

01:08:06.983 --> 01:08:10.151
He'll be here, I promise.

01:08:10.220 --> 01:08:13.154
I think Gus's Santa suit
will fit you perfectly.

01:08:13.223 --> 01:08:14.522
Is that wool?

01:08:14.558 --> 01:08:17.392
Yeah it is,
and there's a cape too.

01:08:17.426 --> 01:08:20.528
Nothing like fake fur
and real wool to keep you warm.

01:08:20.564 --> 01:08:23.131
Otto is allergic to wool,
severely allergic.

01:08:23.166 --> 01:08:25.100
You don't want a Santa
with hives.

01:08:25.135 --> 01:08:26.968
Honey, I'll be fine,
don't worry about it.

01:08:27.002 --> 01:08:29.703
Is there anyone else
you can find?

01:08:32.274 --> 01:08:33.575
No.

01:08:33.609 --> 01:08:35.410
Please.
No.

01:08:35.444 --> 01:08:37.145
I'm happy to take pictures.

01:08:37.180 --> 01:08:39.546
We don't need a photographer,
we need a Santa.

01:08:39.616 --> 01:08:41.316
Come on,

01:08:41.350 --> 01:08:44.919
you don't wanna disappoint
all those little kids, do you?

01:08:46.723 --> 01:08:48.089
All right.

01:08:48.125 --> 01:08:49.691
Yes!

01:08:49.725 --> 01:08:53.361
But I'm not wearing the cape.

01:08:53.395 --> 01:08:55.697
We'll see about that.

01:08:59.469 --> 01:09:02.170
Ho, ho, ho!

01:09:02.205 --> 01:09:04.072
Ho, ho, ho, ho!

01:09:04.107 --> 01:09:06.140
My sleigh.

01:09:06.209 --> 01:09:08.209
Santa, you came!

01:09:08.245 --> 01:09:11.045
I wouldn't have missed it
for the world!

01:09:14.151 --> 01:09:15.817
Hop on up.

01:09:15.852 --> 01:09:18.386
I love you, Santa.

01:09:20.290 --> 01:09:22.823
Well, what do you want
for Christmas?

01:09:22.893 --> 01:09:25.160
Page four is the most important.

01:09:25.228 --> 01:09:26.594
Page four?

01:09:28.131 --> 01:09:29.330
You're very prepared.

01:09:48.685 --> 01:09:49.917
Alec!

01:09:49.986 --> 01:09:51.819
I had no idea you were
so talented.

01:09:51.854 --> 01:09:53.787
These photos are gorgeous.

01:09:53.823 --> 01:09:56.291
The one of Zoey
is my absolute favourite.

01:09:56.326 --> 01:09:57.592
Thank you.

01:09:57.627 --> 01:10:00.161
You're welcome.

01:10:01.398 --> 01:10:04.098
If you'll excuse me.

01:10:08.872 --> 01:10:10.905
Hi.

01:10:10.974 --> 01:10:13.975
You look beautiful.

01:10:14.010 --> 01:10:16.644
Thank you.

01:10:18.582 --> 01:10:19.781
Do you wanna dance?

01:10:19.816 --> 01:10:21.015
Yeah.

01:10:42.939 --> 01:10:45.240
What a wonderful party, huh?

01:10:51.615 --> 01:10:54.415
On behalf of the entire town
of Aurora,

01:10:54.451 --> 01:10:57.885
thank you to our host
Zoey Hathaway.

01:11:00.490 --> 01:11:03.558
Stop, thank you.
This is so sweet.

01:11:03.593 --> 01:11:06.661
Welcome home, Zoey,
we missed you.

01:11:06.696 --> 01:11:09.097
And thank you to Alec Wynn.

01:11:09.132 --> 01:11:12.834
It took a little while
to get to know you,

01:11:12.902 --> 01:11:15.536
but I think he's
a real asset to our town.

01:11:15.572 --> 01:11:20.341
He put all his time
and heart into all of this,

01:11:20.377 --> 01:11:23.344
and now we know what a great
photographer he is!

01:11:27.317 --> 01:11:29.717
Thank you.

01:11:29.753 --> 01:11:32.253
So, come on, let's keep on
dancing, everybody.

01:11:32.289 --> 01:11:33.554
Have a great time tonight!

01:11:41.564 --> 01:11:42.930
Little hot in here, huh?

01:11:42.966 --> 01:11:44.299
Yeah.

01:11:44.334 --> 01:11:45.533
You wanna take a walk?

01:11:45.602 --> 01:11:46.901
Yes, I will go get the coats.

01:11:46.936 --> 01:11:48.569
Okay.

01:11:52.142 --> 01:11:54.108
Yeah.

01:11:54.177 --> 01:11:55.943
Here we go!

01:12:09.959 --> 01:12:11.225
Thank you.

01:12:11.261 --> 01:12:12.894
Well done.

01:12:12.929 --> 01:12:15.430
Thanks for coming, you guys.

01:12:16.833 --> 01:12:19.467
So, I couldn't find the coat,

01:12:19.502 --> 01:12:22.003
but I found this.

01:12:27.610 --> 01:12:29.444
Let me see if I can do it.

01:12:36.953 --> 01:12:39.420
I love it.

01:12:41.458 --> 01:12:42.724
Shall we?

01:12:42.759 --> 01:12:44.959
Yeah.

01:12:58.408 --> 01:13:00.074
I think we did good here, Zoey.

01:13:00.110 --> 01:13:02.410
Yeah I think so, too.

01:13:02.445 --> 01:13:04.612
Oh, look.

01:13:04.647 --> 01:13:06.748
It's here in time for Christmas.

01:13:14.591 --> 01:13:15.690
Zoey!

01:13:15.759 --> 01:13:17.191
There you are.

01:13:17.260 --> 01:13:19.093
Oh, my goodness,
this festival is wonderful!

01:13:19.129 --> 01:13:20.995
I want to make it
an annual event.

01:13:21.064 --> 01:13:22.230
You want to...?

01:13:22.265 --> 01:13:23.531
I'm getting ahead of myself.

01:13:23.566 --> 01:13:25.099
Can you meet me
tomorrow morning?

01:13:25.168 --> 01:13:26.868
I am ready to make
a formal offer.

01:13:28.571 --> 01:13:31.105
Well, this is happening fast.

01:13:31.141 --> 01:13:32.752
Well, it just shows you
how interested we are.

01:13:32.776 --> 01:13:34.008
I've heard all the details.

01:13:34.043 --> 01:13:35.343
You are gonna be very happy.

01:13:35.412 --> 01:13:36.812
You're finally gonna get
your plane.

01:13:38.715 --> 01:13:40.381
These trees aren't going
anywhere.

01:13:40.417 --> 01:13:42.561
I didn't appreciate them until
I saw them with the lights.

01:13:42.585 --> 01:13:45.319
Okay, this is sounding good.

01:13:45.355 --> 01:13:46.988
Good? This is great.

01:13:47.023 --> 01:13:48.834
Okay, now, I want you to go
and enjoy your party.

01:13:48.858 --> 01:13:51.070
I need you at the office at
9 a.m. to sign those documents.

01:13:51.094 --> 01:13:52.326
Okay.

01:13:52.362 --> 01:13:53.661
See you then, Zoey.

01:13:53.696 --> 01:13:55.163
Okay, bye.

01:13:55.231 --> 01:13:58.366
Well, it...

01:13:58.401 --> 01:14:01.436
sounds like you'll be getting
your dream, after all.

01:14:01.504 --> 01:14:04.238
Yeah, it sounds like it could be
the perfect offer.

01:14:04.307 --> 01:14:06.407
Yeah, it really does.

01:14:08.344 --> 01:14:10.678
Well...

01:14:10.747 --> 01:14:14.081
it's been nice helping you
with all this.

01:14:14.117 --> 01:14:17.852
Yeah, it's been nice
working with you.

01:14:19.456 --> 01:14:21.756
Goodnight, Zoey.

01:14:39.442 --> 01:14:42.009
All right, Mom,
I'll see you soon.

01:14:42.045 --> 01:14:43.578
You off to sign the papers?

01:14:43.646 --> 01:14:45.079
Yeah.

01:14:45.148 --> 01:14:47.014
Hey...

01:14:47.050 --> 01:14:48.761
For someone who's about to have
a dream come true,

01:14:48.785 --> 01:14:49.984
you don't look very happy.

01:14:50.019 --> 01:14:51.953
No, I'm happy.

01:14:51.988 --> 01:14:53.421
Zoey?

01:14:56.292 --> 01:14:58.226
I'm your mother.

01:14:58.261 --> 01:15:01.062
I flew 5,000 miles
to be with you.

01:15:01.097 --> 01:15:02.797
Come on,
tell me what's going on.

01:15:02.832 --> 01:15:05.132
You know, I just...

01:15:05.168 --> 01:15:08.469
I thought I knew
where my life was headed.

01:15:08.505 --> 01:15:12.106
I was gonna buy my plane,
I was gonna live in Seattle.

01:15:12.141 --> 01:15:14.208
My whole future was set forever.

01:15:14.244 --> 01:15:16.777
Have you changed your mind?

01:15:16.846 --> 01:15:19.146
I just love this ranch.

01:15:19.182 --> 01:15:21.983
And I love Aurora.

01:15:22.018 --> 01:15:24.719
I love that the people here
know my name,

01:15:24.754 --> 01:15:27.688
and they're happy to see me.

01:15:27.757 --> 01:15:30.725
I love my reindeer.

01:15:30.760 --> 01:15:34.028
I need to find them good homes.

01:15:34.063 --> 01:15:35.730
I just...

01:15:35.765 --> 01:15:39.333
I wish things
could be different.

01:15:39.369 --> 01:15:42.036
Maybe things can be different.

01:15:44.274 --> 01:15:46.807
Thanks, Mom.

01:15:46.843 --> 01:15:48.910
I'll see you soon.

01:15:48.945 --> 01:15:52.246
Hey, is it all right
if I invite a few people over

01:15:52.282 --> 01:15:55.249
for a Christmas Eve open house?

01:15:55.318 --> 01:15:57.785
Are you asking me for permission
to throw a party?

01:15:57.820 --> 01:16:00.688
I think it'd be nice to have one
last celebration here.

01:16:00.723 --> 01:16:03.157
I think it would be nice, too.

01:16:03.192 --> 01:16:05.226
You kids have fun.

01:16:14.203 --> 01:16:15.736
Hey, guys!

01:16:15.805 --> 01:16:18.306
I'm gonna go see Karen, and then
I'll come back and help.

01:16:28.051 --> 01:16:29.617
Well, I don't wanna sound
like Anya,

01:16:29.686 --> 01:16:31.552
but you gotta tell Zoey
how you feel about her.

01:16:31.588 --> 01:16:32.820
It's too late.

01:16:32.855 --> 01:16:34.355
I called the tour company.

01:16:34.390 --> 01:16:36.357
They got a spot for me
if I can get going soon.

01:16:39.529 --> 01:16:42.964
They're swamped at the diner,
I gotta go to work.

01:16:42.999 --> 01:16:44.532
You gotta tell her how you feel.

01:16:44.567 --> 01:16:46.934
And you gotta get going.

01:16:47.003 --> 01:16:48.536
If you get hungry,
swing by Otto's.

01:16:48.571 --> 01:16:50.338
There's always a seat
with your name on it.

01:16:50.373 --> 01:16:51.639
Thanks.

01:16:51.674 --> 01:16:53.040
Yeah.

01:17:19.969 --> 01:17:22.103
Hi, Zoey.
Best festival ever.

01:17:22.138 --> 01:17:23.404
Can't wait for next year.

01:17:23.439 --> 01:17:25.006
Oh, thanks.

01:17:26.809 --> 01:17:28.209
Hey.

01:17:28.244 --> 01:17:30.277
It's been so nice
having you back home.

01:17:30.313 --> 01:17:32.146
I wish you could stay.

01:17:32.181 --> 01:17:33.681
I promise I'll come visit.

01:17:33.750 --> 01:17:35.182
Make sure you do.

01:17:35.251 --> 01:17:36.484
Merry Christmas.

01:17:36.552 --> 01:17:37.985
Merry Christmas,
I'll see you soon.

01:17:38.054 --> 01:17:39.587
Zoey!

01:17:39.622 --> 01:17:41.756
Thank you for giving us
another festival.

01:17:41.791 --> 01:17:43.535
It was like having a little bit
of Gus and Ida back.

01:17:43.559 --> 01:17:45.326
I loved doing it.

01:17:45.361 --> 01:17:47.495
You must be happy to be
going back home

01:17:47.530 --> 01:17:49.096
to your exciting life
in Seattle.

01:17:49.132 --> 01:17:52.033
Yes, yes, I'm really happy.

01:17:52.068 --> 01:17:53.501
I've gotta run.

01:17:53.569 --> 01:17:56.203
- Merry Christmas!
- Merry Christmas!

01:17:56.239 --> 01:17:58.205
Bye.

01:18:08.351 --> 01:18:10.151
Good morning.
Hey.

01:18:10.186 --> 01:18:12.553
Well, I have your contracts
all ready to be signed.

01:18:12.588 --> 01:18:15.056
I'm really sorry.

01:18:17.960 --> 01:18:20.361
No, actually, I'm not sorry.

01:18:22.365 --> 01:18:25.766
I've decided to keep the ranch.

01:18:25.802 --> 01:18:28.035
I know that this might seem
sudden to you,

01:18:28.071 --> 01:18:31.172
but all the pieces are just
kind of clicking into place.

01:18:31.240 --> 01:18:32.807
I've been traveling
my whole life,

01:18:32.875 --> 01:18:34.915
and I think I've finally
figured out where I belong.

01:18:36.446 --> 01:18:38.746
My heart is here.

01:18:38.815 --> 01:18:41.282
It's not in Seattle.

01:18:41.317 --> 01:18:42.717
It's in Aurora.

01:18:42.785 --> 01:18:44.752
But what about flying?

01:18:44.787 --> 01:18:47.188
I can still work out
of Fairbanks.

01:18:47.256 --> 01:18:48.923
Fairbanks is four hours away.

01:18:48.958 --> 01:18:53.027
Listen, it's not perfect,
but I think it would be worth it

01:18:53.062 --> 01:18:55.362
to be able to come home
to the ranch.

01:18:55.398 --> 01:18:58.733
To my ranch.

01:19:01.170 --> 01:19:03.537
Anyway, I am sorry to have
wasted your time.

01:19:03.606 --> 01:19:05.473
You know what?

01:19:05.508 --> 01:19:07.875
Life's not all about business.

01:19:07.910 --> 01:19:09.410
I'm happy you found your home.

01:19:09.445 --> 01:19:12.213
Thank you.

01:19:12.248 --> 01:19:13.714
I am, too.

01:19:19.789 --> 01:19:21.155
Oh, cute!

01:19:21.190 --> 01:19:23.524
Yeah, I know, the baby will be
here any minute,

01:19:23.593 --> 01:19:25.059
so I just wanted to make sure

01:19:25.094 --> 01:19:26.739
there was a present under
the tree, just in case.

01:19:26.763 --> 01:19:28.195
Well, if you ever need
a babysitter,

01:19:28.231 --> 01:19:29.430
I'm really good with kids.

01:19:29.465 --> 01:19:30.998
Yeah? Thank you.

01:19:31.033 --> 01:19:32.311
Wait, I thought you were
selling.

01:19:32.335 --> 01:19:33.667
I decided not to.

01:19:33.703 --> 01:19:35.569
I'm staying in Aurora.

01:19:35.638 --> 01:19:37.004
You are?
Yeah.

01:19:37.039 --> 01:19:38.973
All right, well, look,
with the baby coming

01:19:39.008 --> 01:19:40.808
I need to be closer to home

01:19:40.843 --> 01:19:43.878
so I'm taking Chuck's job
in the airfield.

01:19:43.913 --> 01:19:46.647
And that means this town
will be short a pilot.

01:19:46.682 --> 01:19:48.415
What would you say
about leasing my plane

01:19:48.451 --> 01:19:50.518
and taking over my route?

01:19:50.553 --> 01:19:53.287
I'd say Christmas
is coming early.

01:19:53.322 --> 01:19:54.655
Okay.

01:20:30.226 --> 01:20:31.959
You all right here?

01:20:31.994 --> 01:20:33.160
Thank you.

01:20:33.196 --> 01:20:34.428
Top you off a little.

01:20:34.463 --> 01:20:35.663
Thanks, darlin'.

01:20:35.698 --> 01:20:38.165
Of course, Merry Christmas.

01:20:40.469 --> 01:20:41.802
Okay, what can I do to help?

01:20:41.871 --> 01:20:43.370
You know what?

01:20:43.406 --> 01:20:45.739
I think we've got this Christmas
Eve feast under control.

01:20:45.808 --> 01:20:47.208
You sure you're okay?

01:20:47.243 --> 01:20:49.343
Yeah, I will be.

01:20:49.378 --> 01:20:52.346
Hey, I was wondering.

01:20:52.415 --> 01:20:54.181
This is a big ranch,

01:20:54.250 --> 01:20:57.084
and I think I might
get a little lonely

01:20:57.119 --> 01:21:00.120
with just me and the reindeer.

01:21:00.189 --> 01:21:04.191
How would you guys feel
about helping me run this place

01:21:04.227 --> 01:21:05.860
as a bed and breakfast?

01:21:07.897 --> 01:21:09.096
Yes!

01:21:09.131 --> 01:21:10.464
Really? You would do it?

01:21:10.499 --> 01:21:11.966
Yeah!

01:21:12.001 --> 01:21:13.834
The ranch would make
a great B&B.

01:21:13.903 --> 01:21:15.703
Gus gave me this wonderful gift.

01:21:15.738 --> 01:21:17.705
I think we need to share it
with the world.

01:21:17.740 --> 01:21:19.773
Oh, my gosh.

01:21:24.747 --> 01:21:27.514
I knew from the moment
that we drove up here

01:21:27.550 --> 01:21:29.683
that you were not gonna sell
this ranch.

01:21:29.752 --> 01:21:31.452
You're gonna be very happy here.

01:21:31.487 --> 01:21:33.621
Thank you, I think so too.

01:21:36.559 --> 01:21:38.692
Alec?

01:21:40.263 --> 01:21:42.396
Sorry to take you away
from your party.

01:21:42.465 --> 01:21:44.331
Can I talk to you for a minute?

01:21:44.367 --> 01:21:45.866
In private?

01:21:45.935 --> 01:21:47.935
Yeah, sure.

01:21:51.707 --> 01:21:54.608
I drove 50 miles out of town,

01:21:54.677 --> 01:21:59.380
and I asked myself,
"What am I doing?"

01:22:01.384 --> 01:22:04.985
So, I stopped the truck
and I thought about things.

01:22:05.021 --> 01:22:07.721
What kinds of things?

01:22:07.757 --> 01:22:10.224
I never put down roots

01:22:10.259 --> 01:22:15.095
because I was always off chasing
the next big adventure.

01:22:15.164 --> 01:22:16.931
But what if the biggest
adventure of all

01:22:16.999 --> 01:22:19.233
was you and I starting a life
together?

01:22:19.302 --> 01:22:22.603
Doesn't have to be Alaska.

01:22:22.638 --> 01:22:24.271
Can be Seattle.

01:22:24.307 --> 01:22:26.307
Can be anything you want.

01:22:28.911 --> 01:22:32.112
Well, how would you like to
build a life with me in Aurora?

01:22:34.216 --> 01:22:35.416
What?

01:22:35.484 --> 01:22:37.851
I decided not to sell.

01:22:37.887 --> 01:22:40.354
I'm keeping the ranch.

01:22:49.198 --> 01:22:54.234
I would love to start a life
with you in Aurora.
