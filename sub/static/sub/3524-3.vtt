01:37.964 --> 01:39.363
It happens.

01:41.434 --> 01:43.834
Massachusetts!

01:52.078 --> 01:53.841
Listen to this shit.

01:53.947 --> 01:57.314
"New Jersey Council of Indian Affairs
has announced plans...

01:57.383 --> 02:00.443
"to disrupt Monday's Columbus Day Parade
in Newark.

02:00.520 --> 02:04.251
"Council Chairman, Del Redclay,
Professor of Cultural Anthropology... "

02:04.324 --> 02:06.315
Stop blowing your nose, I want to hear this.

02:06.392 --> 02:08.952
"... says council members and supporters
will lie down...

02:09.027 --> 02:11.019
"in the path of Columbus Day marchers...

02:11.097 --> 02:14.726
"'in protest of Columbus' role
in the genocide...

02:14.801 --> 02:17.599
"'of America's native peoples. '

02:17.837 --> 02:21.637
"To launch their protest, the
Native Americans and their sympathizers...

02:21.708 --> 02:23.767
"plan to begin a deathwatch tomorrow...

02:23.843 --> 02:27.244
"over the statue of Columbus
in Christopher Columbus Park. "

02:27.313 --> 02:30.942
Some fucking balls, bad-mouthing America,
especially now.

02:31.584 --> 02:34.018
I thought that Columbus
was the hero of America.

02:34.087 --> 02:36.817
See, it's these Indians
and the Commie fucks.

02:36.890 --> 02:40.951
They wanna paint Columbus
as a slave trader instead of an explorer.

02:41.127 --> 02:43.891
You gotta admit, they did get massacred,
the Indians.

02:43.963 --> 02:46.693
We gave them
a bunch a shit to make up for that.

02:46.766 --> 02:48.666
Land, reservations.

02:49.035 --> 02:50.468
And now they got the casinos.

02:50.537 --> 02:53.028
What the fuck we ever get
we didn't have to work for?

02:53.106 --> 02:54.733
I wouldn't mind sitting all day...

02:54.807 --> 02:57.674
smoking mushrooms
and collecting government checks.

02:59.913 --> 03:03.178
You know what it is? I'll tell you what it is.

03:03.583 --> 03:06.017
It's anti-Italian discrimination.

03:06.386 --> 03:09.253
Columbus Day is a day of Italian pride.

03:10.290 --> 03:13.282
It's our holiday,
and they wanna take it away.

03:13.459 --> 03:14.824
Fuck them.

03:15.828 --> 03:17.921
But I never liked Columbus.

03:19.299 --> 03:22.826
In Napoli, a lot of people
are not so happy for Columbus...

03:22.902 --> 03:25.564
- 'cause he was from Genova.
- What's the problem with Genova?

03:25.638 --> 03:28.664
The North of Italy
always have the money and the power.

03:28.741 --> 03:31.733
They punish the South
since hundreds of years.

03:31.811 --> 03:35.178
Even today, they put up their nose at us,
like we're peasants.

03:36.549 --> 03:37.948
I hate the North.

03:38.351 --> 03:41.548
- Jesus, take it easy.
- I'm gonna take action, here.

03:55.802 --> 03:58.327
Ro, gonna go to
the church luncheon tomorrow?

03:58.404 --> 04:01.373
It's on the subject
of Italian-American women and pride.

04:01.441 --> 04:03.875
- I guess 'cause of Columbus Day.
- Who's the star?

04:03.943 --> 04:07.538
- A woman professor from Montclair State.
- Father Phil says she's very good.

04:07.614 --> 04:09.912
- You should come, Adriana.
- Me?

04:09.983 --> 04:11.109
Yeah, come with us.

04:11.184 --> 04:13.516
Noon in the bingo room
at Saint Peter and Paul's.

04:13.586 --> 04:15.816
They have a series of ladies' luncheons
every week.

04:15.888 --> 04:18.914
The food is good,
and the speakers have been fantastic.

04:21.160 --> 04:23.788
Furio Giunta just bought himself
a little house in Nutley.

04:23.863 --> 04:25.194
He is so gorgeous.

04:25.265 --> 04:27.062
I'm surprised nobody snapped him up yet.

04:27.133 --> 04:29.727
- I think he should lose the ponytail.
- You do?

04:29.802 --> 04:32.794
- I think it looks great on him.
- That's his trademark.

04:32.872 --> 04:36.308
Sandi Fortunato says
it looks like a dick coming out of his head.

04:36.376 --> 04:39.743
And she pretends to be his friend.
What a two-face.

04:41.681 --> 04:44.081
<i>How much money did you make today, slut?</i>

04:45.151 --> 04:47.711
- $300.
- That's all, bitch?

04:47.954 --> 04:51.549
I'm gonna put you back on the street.
Make you work that ass.

04:52.158 --> 04:56.492
- Put me back on the street, baby, yeah.
- Work that ass, you little cunt.

04:57.530 --> 04:59.521
Yeah, you work it, baby.

04:59.899 --> 05:02.891
Mama's little tramp. Mama's little whore.

05:03.603 --> 05:05.662
I'm gonna pimp you out, bitch.

05:08.875 --> 05:10.536
I gotta get that.

05:13.746 --> 05:14.735
Hello?

05:15.315 --> 05:17.408
No. Hi, Ro, how are you?

05:18.051 --> 05:19.211
What?

05:19.719 --> 05:21.778
I can't hear you too good.

05:22.789 --> 05:25.656
It must be your cell phone. You in the car?

05:26.192 --> 05:27.955
No, I'm coming home.

05:28.394 --> 05:29.383
Yeah.

05:29.729 --> 05:31.492
No, chicken's great.

05:34.867 --> 05:36.562
No. Yeah. Me, too.

05:36.903 --> 05:37.892
Bye.

05:43.676 --> 05:45.667
God, we're so naughty.

05:48.214 --> 05:51.308
- How can we do this with Ro on the phone?
- What?

05:54.487 --> 05:55.886
We're so wacky.

05:56.356 --> 05:58.221
No regard for nothing.

06:06.532 --> 06:09.763
<i>- Operator.
- Yeah, I'd like to make a collect call.</i>

06:10.770 --> 06:12.829
Area code 917.

06:16.542 --> 06:17.702
Speak.

06:18.077 --> 06:20.272
<i>Collect call from Mr. Walters.</i>

06:20.546 --> 06:22.741
Okay, I'll take it, operator.

06:23.516 --> 06:25.450
- How you doing?
- You know.

06:25.752 --> 06:28.152
Thanks for the stamps. How you getting on?

06:28.221 --> 06:29.586
I feel old.

06:31.724 --> 06:33.021
<i>Listen, John...</i>

06:33.159 --> 06:34.820
I just want to say...

06:34.894 --> 06:39.490
I hope your feelings weren't hurt too bad,
and that it never got back to the missus.

06:39.565 --> 06:42.762
<i>- The fuck you talking about?
- You didn't hear the joke about Ginny?</i>

06:43.703 --> 06:46.297
Never mind. Let it die a death.

06:46.539 --> 06:47.904
What joke?

06:49.075 --> 06:51.771
You're better off not hearing it. Trust me.

06:51.978 --> 06:54.674
Fuck that! I demand you tell me, Paulie!

06:55.181 --> 06:58.639
John, you got more laborers on that job site
than we got carpenters.

06:58.718 --> 07:00.345
What's the problem?

07:00.453 --> 07:03.581
The carpenters
are carrying sheetrock and materials.

07:03.656 --> 07:06.955
- We ain't getting what we expected to get.
- Minimally expected.

07:07.026 --> 07:09.119
Let Massarone hire more laborers
off the books.

07:09.195 --> 07:10.662
Nobody's talking to you!

07:11.664 --> 07:13.291
All right, Jesus.

07:20.173 --> 07:21.640
65:35.

07:24.177 --> 07:26.873
Johnny, you explain the other thing
I want to talk about.

07:26.946 --> 07:27.935
Sure.

07:28.080 --> 07:30.071
Tony, we've discovered
you bought property...

07:30.149 --> 07:33.778
around Frelinghuysen Avenue
and turned it in a week.

07:33.886 --> 07:34.875
So?

07:34.987 --> 07:38.184
You did it with inside knowledge
from Ron Zellman.

07:39.358 --> 07:41.417
Got your attention from where?

07:41.494 --> 07:44.088
That property's hot
because of the Esplanade.

07:44.163 --> 07:46.893
We share the Esplanade. We share Zellman.

07:47.900 --> 07:52.564
If the Soprano family's gonna benefit
from a thing, Carmine feels we should, too.

07:58.711 --> 08:00.941
Okay, we'll work something out.

08:06.018 --> 08:10.148
<i>I've been your doctor for 30 years,
you stil hate the thermometer.</i>

08:11.424 --> 08:13.324
Tony, Furio's here!

08:13.493 --> 08:16.656
Thank you for bringing those strufoli.
I love those.

08:17.563 --> 08:20.760
<i>Here's a few long-term bonds
that I find attractive.</i>

08:20.833 --> 08:24.030
<i>Wouldn't it be great if the person
you trust most was your broker?</i>

08:24.103 --> 08:25.536
<i>Let's look at your allocations.</i>

08:25.605 --> 08:29.473
<i>At Schwab, we give advice
that's not driven by commission.</i>

08:29.542 --> 08:30.975
<i>Call 1- 800-7-SCHWAB...</i>

08:31.043 --> 08:34.102
<i>to set up a consultation
to check the health of your portfolio.</i>

08:34.179 --> 08:36.148
<i>And lay off the junk bonds.</i>

08:40.152 --> 08:43.019
- I got pictures of my new house.
- Let me see.

08:45.858 --> 08:48.088
<i>We'll come back.
We're here today with our guests...</i>

08:48.160 --> 08:52.153
<i>Dr. Dell Redclay, who's a professor
of anthropology at Rutgers University...</i>

08:52.231 --> 08:54.825
<i>and spokesman
for the anti-Columbus protest.</i>

08:54.901 --> 08:55.925
My God.

08:56.002 --> 08:57.526
<i>And also Mr. Philip L. Di Notti...</i>

08:57.603 --> 08:59.400
It's lovely.

08:59.472 --> 09:02.999
<i>...a coalition of Italian-American
anti-defamation organizations.</i>

09:04.176 --> 09:05.165
<i>Okay.</i>

09:07.647 --> 09:10.377
- This thing gets on my nerves.
- Don't get me started.

09:10.449 --> 09:14.249
<i>Well, let's start with the idea
of a parade for a genocidal colonial general.</i>

09:14.320 --> 09:16.288
<i>A national holiday, no less.</i>

09:16.355 --> 09:20.155
<i>- Such festivities are deeply offensive to us.
- These are pretty broad charges.</i>

09:20.226 --> 09:24.595
<i>All know is Italian Americans are
extremely proud of Christopher Columbus...</i>

09:24.664 --> 09:27.189
<i>admiral of the ocean seas,
and a great Italian.</i>

09:27.266 --> 09:30.030
<i>You know very well
of the compromised position we put forth.</i>

09:30.102 --> 09:33.503
<i>Now, if you people wanna make it
an Italian pride parade...</i>

09:33.573 --> 09:34.870
<i>we have no problem with that.</i>

09:34.941 --> 09:37.273
<i>Western history
says Columbus discovered America.</i>

09:37.343 --> 09:40.710
<i>The same America that put your people
in bondage for three centuries.</i>

09:40.780 --> 09:43.305
<i>But every culture has had to bear the pain...</i>

09:43.382 --> 09:48.217
<i>in the making of what I think we can
all agree is a startling economic miracle.</i>

09:48.287 --> 09:50.983
<i>- We cured polio.
- I have to agree with Phil.</i>

09:51.057 --> 09:52.615
<i>- The right to vote.
- Exactly.</i>

09:52.692 --> 09:54.319
<i>Take my grandparents.</i>

09:54.393 --> 09:56.327
<i>Two simple people from Sicily...</i>

09:56.395 --> 10:00.092
<i>- who braved the perilous middle passage...
- Middle passage?</i>

10:00.166 --> 10:02.600
<i>That's the term for the slave trade.</i>

10:03.302 --> 10:06.032
<i>Montel, the Italian people in this country...</i>

10:06.105 --> 10:08.539
<i>also have suffered discrimination.</i>

10:08.774 --> 10:13.211
<i>Earth to Phil.
We're talking 300 years of slavery, here.</i>

10:15.881 --> 10:16.870
Enough.

10:23.255 --> 10:26.349
You okay, Tony?
You look a little muscia-moosh.

10:27.893 --> 10:29.918
Uncle Jun's trial starts today.

10:31.697 --> 10:35.360
- First Soprano family trial in 16 years.
- We should go.

10:36.335 --> 10:38.735
The guys are gonna be at the other place.

10:38.871 --> 10:40.930
Thank you for the cookies.

10:42.642 --> 10:45.110
And congratulations on that house.

10:45.277 --> 10:47.074
And I like the kitchen.

10:47.546 --> 10:49.173
Take a strufoli.

10:59.091 --> 11:00.456
Be seated.

11:02.895 --> 11:04.453
Next case on the calendar...

11:04.530 --> 11:08.159
<i>United States of America
versus Corrado John Soprano et all.</i>

11:08.234 --> 11:10.532
Any applications before I bring in the jury?

11:10.603 --> 11:12.366
No, your honor.

11:12.905 --> 11:15.430
- Bring the jury.
- Telephone charges on your last bill?

11:15.508 --> 11:17.806
Cost me $40
every time you pick up the phone.

11:17.877 --> 11:19.003
I can't...

11:25.918 --> 11:27.886
$2,380, last month alone.

11:27.953 --> 11:30.444
I'm going to give you
some preliminary instructions...

11:30.523 --> 11:33.981
and explain the process
by which we will try this case.

11:34.460 --> 11:36.394
The first order of business...

11:36.629 --> 11:40.656
Looking out at this audience
of proud, strong, beautiful women...

11:41.233 --> 11:44.259
how far we have come
in this American journey.

11:45.204 --> 11:48.799
Look how we've both
preserved the tradition of our ancestors...

11:48.874 --> 11:53.504
and managed to become
new Italian-American women.

11:54.647 --> 11:57.445
Such flair we have added to our image.

11:58.150 --> 12:00.948
And yet, America still sees us...

12:01.353 --> 12:03.787
as pizza makers and Mama Leones.

12:04.990 --> 12:08.482
It is your job, ladies, to spread the word.

12:09.228 --> 12:12.322
Our grandmothers
may have been dressed in black...

12:12.431 --> 12:15.298
but we're in Moschino and Armani.

12:17.670 --> 12:20.036
For those who say Italian Americans...

12:20.106 --> 12:23.166
eat smelly cheese and sip cold wine...

12:23.576 --> 12:27.307
tell them
we're from the land of aromatic Asiago...

12:27.847 --> 12:29.508
and supple Barolo.

12:32.918 --> 12:35.819
If they say, "Spaghetti and meatballs"...

12:35.888 --> 12:39.289
you tell them,
"Orecchiette with broccoli rabe. "

12:42.561 --> 12:47.396
If they say, "John Gotti,"
you tell them, "Rudolph Giuliani. "

12:49.602 --> 12:54.505
A Princeton study showed that 74 percent...

12:54.707 --> 12:58.370
of Americans associated Italian Americans...

12:59.011 --> 13:00.535
with organized crime.

13:01.080 --> 13:03.048
Why would they do this?

13:03.349 --> 13:06.216
Because of the way the media depict us.

13:06.852 --> 13:10.720
Again, it is our job
to make sure people know...

13:10.790 --> 13:13.918
the other side of Italian-American culture.

13:13.993 --> 13:17.622
The educated, wage-earning,
law-abiding side.

13:18.364 --> 13:21.458
Because isn't that who we truly are?

13:28.841 --> 13:29.967
Thank you.

13:33.379 --> 13:34.812
Thank you, Professor Murphy...

13:34.880 --> 13:37.678
or should I call you
Professor Longo-Murphy?

13:37.750 --> 13:40.412
Longo as you don't call me late for dinner.

13:41.420 --> 13:42.409
Small point:

13:42.488 --> 13:45.514
Didn't I read about
a more recent study at Fairleigh Dickinson...

13:45.591 --> 13:47.525
that found the opposite was true?

13:47.593 --> 13:49.993
That the great majority of Americans...

13:50.062 --> 13:52.895
recognize these are fictional portrayals?

13:53.566 --> 13:58.196
We're still looking at the sample
selection criteria used in that study.

13:58.871 --> 14:01.396
Well, thanks for an excellent talk.

14:04.710 --> 14:07.338
And thank you all for attending today.

14:07.413 --> 14:10.576
Don't miss Professor Murphy's new book:

14:10.649 --> 14:14.881
<i>Strega: The Sorceress
as Imago Figure in Italian Literature.</i>

14:17.189 --> 14:21.421
And stick around for coffee and dessert,
courtesy of Cocuzzo's pastry shop.

14:27.700 --> 14:29.827
I'll say it, that was totally uncalled for.

14:29.902 --> 14:33.998
- Father Intintola's forgetting his friends.
- It was outrageous. I'm shocked.

14:34.073 --> 14:37.907
- Everyone's entitled to their opinion.
- Really, though, how dare he?

14:37.977 --> 14:41.572
- After all you've done for this parish.
- What are you gonna do?

14:44.884 --> 14:47.045
I'm gonna cut him a new one.

14:58.063 --> 15:00.361
Father, I don't know what to say,
I'm so upset.

15:00.432 --> 15:02.491
- Why, what's wrong?
- What's wrong?

15:02.568 --> 15:05.332
Carmela is one of your biggest supporters
and friends.

15:05.404 --> 15:08.430
How dare you let her suffer
humiliation and embarrassment...

15:08.507 --> 15:11.032
- at the hands of an outsider?
- What do you mean?

15:11.110 --> 15:13.340
You know exactly what I mean.

15:13.412 --> 15:17.109
Unfortunately, because of her husband's
high profile in the waste industry...

15:17.182 --> 15:19.309
she's the one
who bears the brunt of insults.

15:19.385 --> 15:22.081
But there were many of us
who were equally offended.

15:22.154 --> 15:23.553
I am sorry.

15:24.223 --> 15:27.659
This is an open forum.
You did hear me bring up that new study.

15:27.726 --> 15:30.160
If that's your idea
of a good luncheon speaker...

15:30.229 --> 15:32.424
I suggest you think about
who really keeps...

15:32.498 --> 15:34.932
this parish alive year after year.

15:43.709 --> 15:47.145
<i>The size of your cities
pain the eyes of the red man.</i>

15:47.279 --> 15:49.713
<i>A man in your cities is numb to the stench...</i>

15:49.782 --> 15:51.306
Go back to your reservation!

15:51.383 --> 15:53.476
Mussolini was Hitler's bitch!

15:53.552 --> 15:54.541
Go back!

16:03.028 --> 16:05.258
<i>In the words of Chief Seattle:</i>

16:05.331 --> 16:07.993
<i>"For the last Red Man shall have perished...</i>

16:08.534 --> 16:10.729
<i>"and the memory of my tribe...</i>

16:10.836 --> 16:13.168
<i>"shall have become a myth
among the White Men... "</i>

16:13.238 --> 16:15.502
Take your tom-toms and get out of here!

16:15.574 --> 16:17.633
You son of a bitch!

16:17.710 --> 16:20.611
<i>"... these shores, these woods,
the highway will swarm...</i>

16:20.679 --> 16:24.547
<i>"with the invisible dead of our people!
The White Man will never be alone!"</i>

16:24.616 --> 16:27.585
This is Newark, baby,
we don't play that shit!

16:27.753 --> 16:30.017
And that better not be Columbus!

16:30.589 --> 16:32.648
- Take it down.
- He's going to burn...

16:32.725 --> 16:36.058
- the way our ancestors did!
- Go sit down, cupcake!

16:36.261 --> 16:40.197
<i>- We're not taking anything down!
- We're gonna fucking hang you up there!</i>

16:44.003 --> 16:46.233
Break it up! Let's break it up!

16:48.941 --> 16:51.774
- We will make arrests!
- What the fuck is this, Joey?

16:51.844 --> 16:55.302
They got a permit, Sil.
Everybody, come on, let's go!

16:55.481 --> 16:58.109
- Everybody!
- I'll remember this, Joey.

16:59.218 --> 17:00.412
Come on.

17:02.921 --> 17:04.582
Come on. You, too.

17:09.795 --> 17:10.887
Let me go.

17:11.363 --> 17:13.523
All right, we gotta go.

17:17.970 --> 17:18.959
Shit.

17:19.371 --> 17:21.601
Down with globalization!

17:28.714 --> 17:32.172
What are you doing?
This is a peaceful demonstration, here.

17:36.855 --> 17:39.756
Everybody, get over here!

17:40.259 --> 17:41.726
Get him out of here.

17:44.096 --> 17:45.961
- Take the whole family.
- Let's do it.

17:49.635 --> 17:52.900
Orecchiette and broccoli rabe.
The truth is, that is Northern.

17:52.971 --> 17:55.633
Armani, too. And Michelangelo.

17:57.709 --> 18:00.610
What a coward that man is.
He's always been a lily-liver.

18:00.679 --> 18:02.772
- He's sweet.
- What did he say?

18:02.848 --> 18:05.078
He's all apologetic now. I let him have it.

18:05.150 --> 18:06.811
You did what you could.

18:06.885 --> 18:09.149
I couldn't leave here
without saying something.

18:09.221 --> 18:11.212
I gotta go. I'm getting my new crown today.

18:11.290 --> 18:12.587
All right, bye.

18:15.094 --> 18:19.053
Karen, bring Bobby and the kids over
for a cookout on Saturday.

18:34.613 --> 18:36.547
<i>- Hello?
- It's me, Dad.</i>

18:36.849 --> 18:39.613
<i>- What's up, Bobby?
- Mom tried to call you.</i>

18:39.818 --> 18:43.379
<i>She wants you to pick up some steaks
and eggplants before you come home.</i>

18:43.455 --> 18:45.047
She can't do it?

18:45.357 --> 18:48.019
I'm stuck in traffic,
now I gotta go to the store?

18:48.093 --> 18:50.288
<i>She had to go get some crowns
or something.</i>

18:50.362 --> 18:53.229
Your mother's a real pain
in the you-know-what sometimes.

18:53.298 --> 18:56.392
When she gets home,
tell her I said, "Thanks a lot. "

18:59.404 --> 19:03.397
- Lf you can't find the recipe, I'll ask Angie.
- It's around here somewhere.

19:06.478 --> 19:08.810
Hello. Hi, Gab.

19:11.717 --> 19:13.378
What? When?

19:15.721 --> 19:16.710
Oh, my God!

19:17.990 --> 19:18.979
No!

19:19.725 --> 19:21.522
God, that's terrible.

19:22.961 --> 19:25.020
Yeah, okay.

19:28.400 --> 19:29.890
What happened?

19:33.572 --> 19:36.302
Karen had an accident on Pompton Avenue.

19:37.576 --> 19:38.975
She's dead.

19:54.893 --> 19:58.852
I get home for dinner last night,
Gabby's sitting there devastated.

20:00.299 --> 20:03.029
I just saw Karen at ShopRite last week.

20:03.135 --> 20:04.932
You talking about Karen?

20:05.804 --> 20:07.169
Great kid.

20:08.574 --> 20:11.737
This happened to this doctor I know.
Oriental ran right into him.

20:11.810 --> 20:14.142
What's Bobby gonna do?
He adored that woman.

20:14.213 --> 20:17.341
What are you doing getting arrested
when this family's on trial?

20:17.416 --> 20:19.816
- I'm sorry...
- You went down there, too.

20:19.885 --> 20:21.546
- No.
- It was my idea.

20:21.620 --> 20:22.814
What the fuck?

20:22.888 --> 20:25.823
We got little Paulie in St. Barnabas.
Plus, we lost face there.

20:25.891 --> 20:29.759
This is something that hits home.
I can't turn the other cheek on this.

20:29.861 --> 20:32.659
I know, but we're running a business, here.

20:34.499 --> 20:36.933
Don't you all got something to do?

20:49.081 --> 20:52.414
What's with you? I count on you
to be the most level-headed guy I got.

20:52.484 --> 20:55.942
My father was a Knight of Columbus.
I'm Italian American...

20:56.321 --> 20:57.515
and I pay money...

20:57.589 --> 21:01.389
<i>to the Italian Anti-Defamation
Coordination Council, and basta.</i>

21:01.493 --> 21:04.326
- We're the victims here.
- You write a check, too?

21:04.429 --> 21:05.987
Let's not forget.

21:06.465 --> 21:08.399
It was a friend of ours, Joe Columbo...

21:08.467 --> 21:11.766
who founded the first Italian-American
anti-defamation organization.

21:11.837 --> 21:14.305
- You were still out of line.
- You're right.

21:15.274 --> 21:16.969
A hundred percent.

21:19.044 --> 21:20.033
But?

21:21.380 --> 21:22.369
Well...

21:22.981 --> 21:25.950
<i>as your consigliere, since you ask...</i>

21:26.885 --> 21:30.912
I think the guys, and myself, too,
we need your leadership on this.

21:34.860 --> 21:36.657
All right, good.

21:36.928 --> 21:39.556
I understand you wanna do something,
but use your brain.

21:39.631 --> 21:43.089
Believe me, me and Ralphie
are working on a few things.

21:44.536 --> 21:48.632
This battle's gonna be won
on the PR level. Hearts and minds.

21:49.741 --> 21:52.574
They manipulate your image, Columbus...

21:53.011 --> 21:54.876
you manipulate theirs.

21:55.747 --> 21:57.078
All right.

22:12.664 --> 22:15.531
- Who's calling, please?
- Good morning, Assemblyman.

22:15.600 --> 22:16.589
What's up?

22:16.668 --> 22:19.398
You know this protest
with the Indians and Columbus Day?

22:19.471 --> 22:20.836
I heard about it.

22:20.939 --> 22:22.873
We need somebody to make it go away.

22:22.941 --> 22:26.570
Boy, that's a tough one. Real hot potato.

22:27.379 --> 22:29.347
<i>- Nobody wants to touch it.
- We just want...</i>

22:29.414 --> 22:32.577
a peaceful parade like always,
with no interference.

22:32.651 --> 22:34.278
What's wrong with that?

22:34.453 --> 22:37.286
It's the First Amendment,
and it's Native Americans.

22:37.756 --> 22:39.587
Very sensitive stuff.

22:39.958 --> 22:42.756
My hands are tied on this one. Sorry.

22:43.095 --> 22:45.791
<i>- Yeah, fine.
- I will be attending the parade as always.</i>

22:45.864 --> 22:47.889
You got my support there.

22:48.233 --> 22:49.700
<i>I wish that I could...</i>

22:54.172 --> 22:57.107
The last time that you dated
a friend and colleague...

22:57.175 --> 22:59.541
of your brother's, he left you flat...

22:59.611 --> 23:01.977
disappeared into
the witness protection program.

23:02.047 --> 23:03.912
- I know.
- Now, another man...

23:03.982 --> 23:05.813
who works with your brother...

23:05.884 --> 23:09.376
unable to meet
your basic needs for love and respect...

23:10.288 --> 23:12.051
involved with another woman.

23:12.124 --> 23:14.718
Which brings me back to my childhood.

23:15.260 --> 23:18.696
And my mother and my father.

23:18.764 --> 23:20.061
Now we're talking.

23:20.132 --> 23:22.896
Where I had no love and no support.

23:24.102 --> 23:27.902
And where I was shamed and ridiculed
for being artistic.

23:28.073 --> 23:30.507
In your relationship with these men...

23:30.575 --> 23:33.476
you have replaced your father
with your brother...

23:33.545 --> 23:37.641
as a figure of authority
that you need to prove something to.

23:37.783 --> 23:39.944
You set up these scenarios
with these men...

23:40.018 --> 23:43.317
similar to your father and your brother,
seeking your brother...

23:43.388 --> 23:46.585
i. e., your father's acceptance.

23:48.326 --> 23:50.317
- The hell with them.
- I know.

23:50.395 --> 23:52.886
The work is to make new choices...

23:52.964 --> 23:55.455
that have nothing to do with old patterns.

23:55.634 --> 23:58.535
I want to, Sandy, I do.

23:59.471 --> 24:01.234
God give me the strength.

24:02.307 --> 24:03.296
She will.

24:06.311 --> 24:09.974
<i>Your Star-Ledger interview conflicts
with Eye on New Jersey.</i>

24:15.854 --> 24:17.617
Del Redclay, right?

24:17.889 --> 24:18.981
I knew it.

24:19.057 --> 24:21.491
Yeah, I saw you on Channel 20.
Don't get up.

24:21.560 --> 24:24.256
I'm Henry Caruso. Pleased to meet you.

24:26.932 --> 24:30.368
- Now this lovely lady...
- Maggie Donner, I'm Del's TA.

24:30.502 --> 24:33.300
Yes, I can see that.

24:35.841 --> 24:38.776
Well, I might as well get to the point.

24:43.215 --> 24:46.309
I represent a group of concerned citizens
who are...

24:47.085 --> 24:49.349
very upset about this...

24:50.055 --> 24:52.819
protest you're spearheading,
no puns intended.

24:52.891 --> 24:55.553
- Who do you represent?
- Italians.

24:56.528 --> 24:58.018
Here in New Jersey.

24:58.463 --> 24:59.691
Good people.

25:00.832 --> 25:02.163
Family people.

25:03.201 --> 25:06.102
And they've asked me to tell you that...

25:06.171 --> 25:09.038
it's not in your best interest
to go through with this.

25:09.107 --> 25:10.972
If you've come here to intimidate me...

25:11.042 --> 25:14.842
- you don't know much about Indian resolve.
- Should I call security?

25:17.349 --> 25:20.614
- You remember this guy?
- Iron Eyes Cody, he was an actor.

25:20.952 --> 25:23.944
<i>Son of Paleface, Sitting Bull.</i>

25:27.792 --> 25:29.783
Your fucking poster boy.

25:30.729 --> 25:32.856
Part Cherokee, part Cree.

25:34.332 --> 25:36.493
He wasn't even a fucking Indian.

25:36.735 --> 25:40.728
Second generation Sicilian
from Louisiana named Espera DeCorti.

25:40.939 --> 25:44.466
- I think you better leave now.
- The guy's a total fucking phony.

25:44.676 --> 25:46.200
<i>A total fugace.</i>

25:46.778 --> 25:48.803
Even Jay Silverheels knew it.

25:49.514 --> 25:51.311
But he kept it quiet.

25:51.616 --> 25:53.550
We're not gonna.

25:54.319 --> 25:58.312
You keep up your bullshit,
we're gonna go wide with this thing.

25:58.790 --> 26:00.519
Knock yourself out.

26:07.432 --> 26:11.027
Jesus Christ, is this true?
This is a fucking disaster!

26:12.103 --> 26:14.594
Chill out. You didn't know about this?

26:15.073 --> 26:18.634
<i>- It's been on Access Holywood, E!...
- This is a major PR boner.</i>

26:18.710 --> 26:20.143
It's been researched.

26:20.211 --> 26:23.408
Cody was definitely Native American.
Total environmentalist.

26:23.481 --> 26:27.713
- Are you sure about this?
- Look, I'm one-eighth Italian myself.

26:27.886 --> 26:29.547
You are? You never told me that.

26:29.621 --> 26:32.988
My great-great something or other
was a pony soldier.

26:33.692 --> 26:37.753
Well, actually he was a violinist
attached to the Seventh Cavalry.

26:41.766 --> 26:44.257
That is just one person's opinion, Anthony.

26:44.336 --> 26:48.067
What, football again?
He's not gonna get hurt, he's a tough kid.

26:48.239 --> 26:49.536
Jesus.

26:49.608 --> 26:52.133
We're having a discussion
about Christopher Columbus.

26:52.210 --> 26:53.609
"They would make fine servants.

26:55.480 --> 26:58.210
"With 50 men, we could subgate them... "

26:58.283 --> 26:59.614
Subjugate.

27:01.119 --> 27:03.610
"... and make them do whatever we want. "

27:03.755 --> 27:05.848
That doesn't sound like
a slave trader to you?

27:05.924 --> 27:09.018
George Washington had slaves,
the father of our country.

27:09.094 --> 27:10.288
Well, what's your point?

27:10.362 --> 27:13.422
His history teacher, Mr. Cushman,
is teaching your son...

27:13.498 --> 27:17.366
that if Columbus was alive today, he'd
go on trial for crimes against humanity...

27:17.435 --> 27:19.960
like Milosevic in, you know, Europe.

27:20.939 --> 27:22.338
Your teacher said that?

27:22.407 --> 27:25.069
It's not just my teacher, it's the truth.

27:25.143 --> 27:27.077
It's in my history book.

27:28.780 --> 27:31.510
So you finally read a book and it's bullshit.

27:34.386 --> 27:37.446
You had to walk in Columbus' shoes
to see what he went through.

27:37.522 --> 27:40.047
People thought the world was flat,
for crying out loud.

27:40.125 --> 27:44.391
Then he lands on an island with a bunch of
naked savages on it. That took a lot of guts.

27:44.462 --> 27:47.454
You remember when we went to Florida,
the heat, and those bugs?

27:47.532 --> 27:50.262
Like it took guts to murder people
and put them in chains.

27:50.335 --> 27:53.327
- He was a victim of his time.
- Who cares? It's what he did.

27:53.405 --> 27:55.396
He discovered America, is what he did.

27:55.473 --> 27:56.997
He was a brave Italian explorer.

27:57.075 --> 27:59.305
And in this house,
Christopher Columbus is a hero.

27:59.377 --> 28:00.867
End of story.

28:25.537 --> 28:27.198
I should've known.

28:29.274 --> 28:31.606
I should've known you needed me.

28:32.243 --> 28:34.268
I should've been with you.

28:35.180 --> 28:37.478
I should've been in your place.

28:39.918 --> 28:42.580
My love, my sweet love.

29:02.474 --> 29:04.101
How he loved her.

29:15.987 --> 29:18.251
You know what I heard one time?

29:18.323 --> 29:21.053
Sil was on the phone.
He was talking with somebody...

29:21.126 --> 29:24.755
<i>about how Bobby was the only one of them
who doesn't have a cumare.</i>

29:24.829 --> 29:26.694
They were laughing at him.

29:26.765 --> 29:29.962
- Who was he talking to on the phone?
- I don't know.

29:33.471 --> 29:37.703
I'll go first this time.
I'll bring my eggplant parm over to Bobby's.

29:37.776 --> 29:40.267
Actually, tomorrow is better for me.

29:44.783 --> 29:46.114
Ginny, hi.

29:46.317 --> 29:49.013
We were just talking about
who's gonna do what when.

29:49.087 --> 29:51.817
I played canasta with her just last week.

29:58.730 --> 30:00.823
There he is. John, look...

30:01.332 --> 30:05.359
I'm sorry I missed Allegra's
nursing school graduation. Unforgivable.

30:05.770 --> 30:07.738
But I made it up to her.

30:10.241 --> 30:12.038
Stick it in your ass.

30:14.879 --> 30:17.643
- Hey, Count Chocula...
- What the fuck, John?

30:17.715 --> 30:19.580
Keep him away from me.

30:20.518 --> 30:23.817
- John, what's going on?
- I don't wanna talk about it.

30:25.089 --> 30:26.556
What's this?

30:27.458 --> 30:29.358
I have no fucking idea.

30:31.729 --> 30:33.924
But I got better shit to do.

30:40.305 --> 30:43.741
You saw how it was with them
at dinner the other night?

30:44.375 --> 30:46.002
Something's going on.

30:48.112 --> 30:52.674
Plus, out of nowhere, Carmine's up my ass
on this Frelinghuysen Avenue bullshit.

30:52.750 --> 30:54.581
Somebody's talking too much.

30:54.953 --> 30:56.853
And it's costing me money.

30:59.057 --> 31:00.319
Come on.

31:02.393 --> 31:04.054
There's no release.

31:04.696 --> 31:06.493
I'm surrounded by death.

31:06.564 --> 31:09.226
My husband, my son, my friend.

31:09.801 --> 31:11.428
I don't know what to tell you, Ro.

31:11.502 --> 31:15.268
There's pieces torn out of me,
chunks of me that are dead.

31:15.773 --> 31:18.833
Look at me.
My youth, my looks, they're gone.

31:18.910 --> 31:19.899
No.

31:20.478 --> 31:23.174
That's from not taking care of yourself.

31:23.915 --> 31:27.009
- Dwelling on all this stuff.
- It's not "stuff. "

31:28.086 --> 31:31.112
Do you have any idea what it feels like?

31:32.357 --> 31:33.517
Do you?

31:33.892 --> 31:37.020
It's not "stuff. " It's death, it's pain!

31:42.600 --> 31:45.592
I'm having a lot of trouble dealing with this.

31:46.638 --> 31:49.004
- I don't know.
- You don't know what?

31:50.842 --> 31:52.969
I don't think I can do this.

31:54.812 --> 31:56.939
I don't think I can help you.

31:59.550 --> 32:01.279
You need a lot right now.

32:01.653 --> 32:03.518
I don't think there's anything I can do.

32:03.588 --> 32:06.557
You can be there for me,
you could comfort me.

32:08.960 --> 32:10.427
What about me?

32:11.095 --> 32:13.359
- What do I get out of it?
- There it is.

32:13.431 --> 32:15.763
Right there. What do you get?

32:16.567 --> 32:19.297
How about your every need taken care of?

32:19.404 --> 32:24.398
Sexually, everything!
All your shit. It's all about you, isn't it?

32:24.876 --> 32:27.470
It's not all about me, but, I mean...

32:28.479 --> 32:31.175
- let's be realistic.
- "Let's be realistic"?

32:31.316 --> 32:33.147
What, you wanna leave me?

32:38.022 --> 32:39.011
Yeah.

32:39.791 --> 32:41.656
Then get the fuck out.

32:43.594 --> 32:45.061
It doesn't have to be like this.

32:45.129 --> 32:48.098
How should it be?
How the fuck should it be?

32:59.077 --> 33:01.637
Somehow Carmine found out
we were flipping properties...

33:01.713 --> 33:05.308
on Frelinghuysen Avenue, so your take's
a little less than we talked about.

33:05.383 --> 33:07.283
He makes an issue out of Zellman?

33:08.553 --> 33:11.647
- What's this one called, Hesh?
- This is Pie-O-My.

33:11.923 --> 33:15.051
Just broke her maiden
at Belmont last month. A lot of speed.

33:15.126 --> 33:16.957
- I'm buying her.
- Cool, man.

33:17.028 --> 33:18.086
She's beautiful.

33:18.162 --> 33:19.459
That's right.

33:21.032 --> 33:23.626
Don't you know somebody over there at...

33:23.701 --> 33:26.033
Deerpark Casino in Connecticut?

33:26.404 --> 33:27.894
Run by the Mohonk tribe?

33:27.972 --> 33:29.837
Yeah, Marty. My niece's husband.

33:29.907 --> 33:32.899
This Columbus Day protest,
we need somebody to make it go away.

33:32.977 --> 33:34.535
What's wrong with freedom of speech?

33:34.612 --> 33:36.580
Listen to my kid talking about Columbus.

33:36.647 --> 33:37.875
Calls him a murdering thief.

33:37.949 --> 33:40.975
- They wiped out almost all of my people.
- Cubans are from Spain.

33:41.052 --> 33:44.920
They were Taino Indians who got raped
by Columbus and the Conquistadors.

33:44.989 --> 33:46.013
That's right, Reuben.

33:46.090 --> 33:48.558
<i>Mulignon got Martin Luther King Day,
what do we got?</i>

33:48.626 --> 33:51.424
- I have sympathy for the red man.
- Why is that?

33:51.496 --> 33:54.761
Jews, because of their history,
have common cause with the oppressed.

33:54.832 --> 33:58.461
Some Indians were deliberately
given blankets tainted with smallpox.

33:58.536 --> 34:00.595
- Died like flies.
- No shit?

34:00.671 --> 34:02.298
- Yeah, shit.
- Yeah?

34:02.473 --> 34:05.101
You wanna talk about terrorism?
Look who started it.

34:05.176 --> 34:07.371
- Amen to that, my friend.
- That's right.

34:07.445 --> 34:10.005
Christopher Columbus
was no better than Adolf Hitler.

34:10.614 --> 34:11.877
Back up.

34:12.417 --> 34:13.850
- Hitler?
- Yeah.

34:13.918 --> 34:15.442
I'm not the only one who thinks so.

34:15.520 --> 34:19.353
That Indian from the protest
who was whining about the wilderness?

34:19.424 --> 34:21.858
They had him on T.V.,
and he called Columbus Hitler.

34:21.926 --> 34:24.793
- 'Cause it's true, man.
- You're talking out of your ass.

34:24.862 --> 34:27.989
Columbus and Hitler?
You're trivializing the Holocaust.

34:28.065 --> 34:31.661
Frankly, Reuben, if you got
that kind of covert anti-Semitism...

34:31.735 --> 34:33.431
I'd like you to leave my house.

34:33.504 --> 34:35.301
- Anti-Semitism?
- That's right.

34:35.373 --> 34:37.068
Fuck you, too, my man!

34:37.141 --> 34:40.668
Guys, come on. Reuben, Hesh,
you guys been friends for years.

34:50.188 --> 34:53.554
I'll call Marty up in Connecticut.
He knows a big Mohonk.

34:54.092 --> 34:55.650
That cocksucker.

34:56.694 --> 34:59.822
We're not tired.
I didn't spill food 'cause I'm tired.

35:00.998 --> 35:03.967
Don't argue, okay?
Listen to your Aunt Grace and Aunt Mary.

35:04.035 --> 35:05.662
Do what they say.

35:10.608 --> 35:12.701
All right, say good night
to your Aunt Carmela.

35:12.777 --> 35:14.870
Good night, Aunt Carmela.

35:16.380 --> 35:18.348
It's great your family could come down.

35:18.416 --> 35:21.476
They're leaving tomorrow.
Somebody's sick up there.

35:21.552 --> 35:22.883
Dad?

35:32.196 --> 35:34.824
- Dad, Sophia locked the door!
- Should I get that?

35:34.899 --> 35:36.890
He takes all my pencils!

35:44.509 --> 35:47.273
- Baccilieri residence.
- Carmela, is that you?

35:48.146 --> 35:50.171
- It's Corrado.
- Hello.

35:50.248 --> 35:53.775
How's my boy, Bobby, doing?
He knows I couldn't make it to the services.

35:53.851 --> 35:57.548
<i>- He's all right, he's upstairs with the kids.
- What a heartbreak.</i>

35:57.889 --> 36:01.450
You know, I remember
the first time I met her like it was yesterday.

36:01.526 --> 36:04.984
It was my birthday dinner
at Roman Gardens. I'll never forget it.

36:05.062 --> 36:07.690
She said I looked like Pablo Picasso.

36:07.765 --> 36:09.858
<i>And l didn't even know what he looked like.</i>

36:09.934 --> 36:12.368
But one day,
she showed me a picture of him...

36:12.436 --> 36:13.994
and, you know, she was right.

36:14.071 --> 36:15.834
That's very touching. Let me get Bobby.

36:15.907 --> 36:19.308
I wanna know if he'll pick me up for court
or if I should call Murf.

36:19.377 --> 36:22.835
Maybe you should let Bobby be.
Think about his needs instead of your own.

36:22.914 --> 36:25.576
It's not me. Don't villainize me, here.

36:25.650 --> 36:28.551
Murf goes to bed early,
so I wanted to call him now...

36:28.619 --> 36:30.644
if I need him to drive me.

36:30.755 --> 36:34.555
I don't wanna disturb him when he's asleep.
He's an old man, for God's sake.

36:50.942 --> 36:52.933
Stella!

36:54.245 --> 36:56.145
What the fuck are you doing?

36:58.516 --> 37:01.542
We don't have to hide, baby. I did it.

37:03.588 --> 37:05.749
- I told Ro.
- You told her about us?

37:05.823 --> 37:06.983
No.

37:07.959 --> 37:11.326
I told her I didn't
wanna be with her anymore, and I left!

37:25.076 --> 37:28.068
Now I can devote myself to you completely.

37:28.679 --> 37:31.773
Now there can be no more fear.

37:32.083 --> 37:33.573
No more guilt.

37:35.653 --> 37:37.382
- Just sex.
- Yeah.

37:39.423 --> 37:41.050
You know what I want.

37:41.125 --> 37:43.320
And you want it all, don't you?

37:46.264 --> 37:49.461
Oh, yeah. You need me, slut.

37:49.967 --> 37:51.628
I need it all, baby!

37:53.738 --> 37:54.966
Oh, shit!

37:55.373 --> 37:58.809
Tonight's my night.
I gotta bring food over to Bobby Bacala's.

37:59.277 --> 38:00.835
You're on ziti patrol, too?

38:01.846 --> 38:04.747
- Ro's got Thursdays.
- Well, what should I do?

38:14.558 --> 38:16.924
You could do me a solid, Tony.

38:16.994 --> 38:18.791
Next time you see Hesh...

38:19.063 --> 38:22.726
remind him
my granddaughter's Bat Mitzvah present...

38:23.301 --> 38:24.791
doesn't really work.

38:24.869 --> 38:28.327
The bubble jet printer.
I don't like to keep hocking him.

38:28.939 --> 38:30.600
He knows about it.

38:30.908 --> 38:32.899
He said he lost the sales slip.

38:32.977 --> 38:35.036
So, Marty, where is this guy?

38:37.081 --> 38:40.175
There he is. What'd I say? Right on cue.

38:41.519 --> 38:42.611
Chief.

38:42.687 --> 38:45.554
- Where, behind the preppy guy?
- That's him.

38:47.525 --> 38:51.825
Chief, I'd like to introduce you
to my friends, Silvio Dante...

38:51.996 --> 38:54.988
Tony Soprano.
The guy I was telling you about.

38:56.000 --> 38:57.399
Chief Doug Smith.

38:57.702 --> 39:02.264
Tribal chairman of the Mohonk Indians
and CEO of Mohonk Enterprises.

39:02.340 --> 39:05.241
- An honor.
- Thanks for coming all the way down here.

39:05.309 --> 39:08.506
- I had business in Manhattan anyway.
- Not again.

39:09.413 --> 39:12.871
Would you bring the gentleman
a Ketel One, please?

39:15.586 --> 39:18.714
So, Chief, he told you about
the shit going down in Newark?

39:18.823 --> 39:21.417
Small element. Ruins it for the rest of us.

39:21.492 --> 39:25.758
I've got a $250 million casino
and a huge Italian-American customer base.

39:25.830 --> 39:28.390
Providence, east Boston. Good people.

39:28.466 --> 39:31.128
Our part of the world.
We're closer than Atlantic City.

39:31.202 --> 39:33.966
This is a brand new facility, state-of-the-art.

39:34.038 --> 39:37.496
This fucking protest. They're burning
Columbus in effigy down there.

39:37.575 --> 39:40.942
- They'll lay down in front of the parade.
- That's not gonna happen.

39:41.011 --> 39:44.412
People like Redclay,
they're out of touch, in their ivory towers.

39:44.482 --> 39:46.780
They don't understand
the economic opportunity...

39:46.851 --> 39:49.046
that funds
much of the Native American community.

39:49.120 --> 39:51.748
You should see
the Olympic-size swimming pool...

39:51.822 --> 39:55.189
this man put in
the Deerpark reservation rec center.

39:56.394 --> 39:58.055
Well, we all got kids.

39:58.129 --> 40:01.462
We don't want to see our heritage attacked,
that's all.

40:08.639 --> 40:12.006
No offense, Chief,
but you don't look much like an Indian.

40:12.076 --> 40:14.510
Frankly, I passed most of my life as white...

40:14.578 --> 40:17.604
until I had a racial awakening
and discovered my Mohonk blood.

40:17.681 --> 40:21.378
My grandmother on my father's side,
her mother was a quarter Mohonk.

40:21.485 --> 40:24.215
All this happened
when the casino bill got passed, right?

40:24.288 --> 40:27.689
- Better late than never.
- Mohonk if you love Columbus.

40:31.929 --> 40:34.363
Sorry I didn't make it last night.

40:35.266 --> 40:39.600
My Bible group had a potluck for
the homeless and I was on cleanup crew.

40:40.604 --> 40:43.698
Food, food.
Like that solves all the world's problems.

40:43.808 --> 40:46.971
Bobby, we've been neighbors.
I know that we don't talk much...

40:47.044 --> 40:49.638
but if you want to, I'm here for you.

41:04.995 --> 41:06.292
What is it?

41:11.001 --> 41:12.468
That day...

41:14.138 --> 41:16.106
when she had the accident...

41:17.341 --> 41:19.241
I was stuck in traffic.

41:20.311 --> 41:24.543
And my son called because Karen
wanted me to pick up steaks and eggplants.

41:24.782 --> 41:27.307
And I was mad at her for sending me.

41:27.585 --> 41:29.018
I was tired.

41:31.789 --> 41:36.556
I was mad at her. But I was stuck in traffic
because of her accident.

41:38.262 --> 41:42.028
She was up the road ahead of me,
lying in twisted metal.

41:42.466 --> 41:45.230
But I didn't know,
and I could've been with her.

41:45.302 --> 41:47.793
I should've been there to help her.

41:49.573 --> 41:51.404
But I was mad at her.

41:53.878 --> 41:55.937
My sweet Karen.

41:57.581 --> 41:59.105
My sweet girl.

42:06.857 --> 42:08.347
Pass me the peppers.

42:15.065 --> 42:16.054
Hello.

42:18.502 --> 42:20.333
Yeah. Just a second.

42:20.704 --> 42:22.865
Ton', it's the Indian Chief.

42:33.417 --> 42:34.475
Doug, how are you?

42:34.552 --> 42:39.353
Tony, I wish I had better news.
I struck out. Redclay didn't go for it.

42:40.758 --> 42:42.487
Ask him about the Iron Eyes Cody thing.

42:42.560 --> 42:44.187
<i>The guy pretended he didn't know me.</i>

42:44.261 --> 42:45.785
You believe the son of a bitch?

42:45.863 --> 42:47.490
Ask him about Cody.

42:48.132 --> 42:50.123
You ask him about Iron Eyes Cody?

42:50.200 --> 42:52.794
He didn't give a shit.
It was some internet rumor.

42:52.870 --> 42:55.031
Most Native Americans
don't give a flying fuck.

42:55.105 --> 42:57.403
It's like knowing James Caan isn't Italian.

42:57.474 --> 42:58.998
<i>Al right, wel...</i>

42:59.076 --> 43:01.476
it was nice meeting you,
and I appreciate the effort.

43:01.545 --> 43:04.480
You gotta let me make it up to you.
Come on up, spend a day.

43:04.548 --> 43:08.245
Sil, whoever you want.
High rollers room, everything comped.

43:08.319 --> 43:10.651
- Sure, that sounds good.
- Great.

43:12.489 --> 43:14.980
What the fuck did he say
about Iron Eyes Cody?

43:15.059 --> 43:16.720
He said Ralphie had it all fucked up.

43:16.794 --> 43:21.458
And it don't mean nothing anyway, 'cause
it's like knowing James Caan isn't Italian.

43:30.474 --> 43:33.602
We think this guy, Redclay,
is fucking a graduate student.

43:33.677 --> 43:36.703
- We hire a detective...
- I think it's over, Sil.

43:36.947 --> 43:39.347
- Yeah, but all we gotta...
- It's over.

43:44.822 --> 43:46.915
He had just lost his wife.

43:47.858 --> 43:49.826
And he had so much sadness.

43:50.494 --> 43:54.362
So much love for her,
such complete and pure emotion.

43:55.833 --> 43:58.461
I felt unworthy to even be in his presence.

43:58.535 --> 44:01.060
I was so moved by him.

44:03.707 --> 44:05.698
And then I look at Ralphie.

44:05.776 --> 44:09.872
You saw, in this man,
the things that you want in your life.

44:11.882 --> 44:13.179
Truth.

44:14.184 --> 44:15.617
- Love.
- Yes.

44:16.687 --> 44:21.624
Somehow, I have to find a way to move away
from the darkness and toward the light.

44:21.925 --> 44:23.756
What does this man do?

44:23.827 --> 44:26.387
He works with my brother,
but he's not like the others.

44:26.463 --> 44:29.227
- Janice...
- Sandy, he's different. Believe me.

44:30.467 --> 44:31.456
Okay.

44:33.504 --> 44:35.529
But back to Ralph.

44:37.307 --> 44:39.502
You've got to sit him down...

44:39.576 --> 44:40.804
and level with him.

44:40.878 --> 44:42.573
Speak the truth, Jan...

44:42.746 --> 44:46.443
but with the compassion and respect
that you're famous for.

44:47.518 --> 44:49.145
And say goodbye...

44:49.486 --> 44:51.750
for his sake, as well as yours.

44:53.857 --> 44:55.347
You're right.

44:56.694 --> 44:58.161
It's not his fault.

45:05.402 --> 45:07.836
Roll me some numbers, fearless leader.

45:07.905 --> 45:10.169
- Coming at you.
- Yeah, I'm ready, six.

45:11.909 --> 45:12.876
It's all right.

45:12.943 --> 45:16.640
You had a great run, T.
You held the dice for quite a while.

45:20.084 --> 45:21.711
Look at this operation.

45:21.785 --> 45:23.548
Whenever I'm in one of these places...

45:23.620 --> 45:26.316
I remember that my grandmother
was part Fugawe.

45:26.390 --> 45:28.688
Maybe I should do something about it.

45:28.826 --> 45:31.124
- Bullshit.
- No, it's true.

45:31.562 --> 45:34.895
She was. They were a nomadic tribe,
they'd wander around, get lost...

45:34.965 --> 45:36.796
and they go, "Where the Fugawe?"

45:39.169 --> 45:42.696
I see you gentlemen are having a good time.
You getting enough to eat?

45:42.773 --> 45:43.762
Yeah.

45:44.141 --> 45:46.006
Running out of my comps here.

45:46.076 --> 45:48.442
Go find Marty. He's on the floor somewhere.

45:48.512 --> 45:51.345
Tony, can we talk a minute?
Buy you a drink?

45:51.515 --> 45:53.005
Yeah, sure.

45:55.819 --> 45:58.652
I wanted to give you a check
for Jason's tuition.

45:59.123 --> 46:00.181
Okay.

46:00.991 --> 46:04.188
- The statement's up in my bedroom.
- That's okay, I trust you.

46:04.361 --> 46:05.555
Wait...

46:05.996 --> 46:07.429
is it 5:00?

46:10.634 --> 46:13.262
<i>John, l'm here
at Christopher Columbus Park in Newark...</i>

46:13.337 --> 46:16.238
<i>where this afternoon
violence broke out briefly...</i>

46:16.306 --> 46:20.265
<i>between Native American demonstrators
and members of a coalition...</i>

46:20.344 --> 46:24.337
<i>of 18 various
ltalian-American pride organizations.</i>

46:25.182 --> 46:28.310
<i>Get out of here! This is our day!
You hear that?</i>

46:28.385 --> 46:30.615
<i>He fed our people to his dogs!</i>

46:34.491 --> 46:36.356
My God, this is tragic.

46:40.364 --> 46:43.060
<i>Could be scored with Albinoni's Adagio.</i>

47:14.097 --> 47:15.587
Janootski!

47:23.273 --> 47:24.740
This is it, hon.

47:24.875 --> 47:27.639
This is the last of the stuff I had at Ro's.

47:30.113 --> 47:31.273
Your shoes.

47:32.216 --> 47:33.205
What?

47:33.283 --> 47:37.049
Didn't I ask you to take your shoes off
when you came in this house?

47:39.756 --> 47:40.745
Forgot.

47:41.291 --> 47:43.282
- Sorry, hon.
- You forgot.

47:43.493 --> 47:46.326
So that's just it. You fucking forgot!

47:52.369 --> 47:53.358
Oh, fuck.

47:54.771 --> 47:56.796
Get out!

48:01.578 --> 48:02.977
My back.

48:03.814 --> 48:05.907
I'll kill you, you crazy bitch.

48:06.450 --> 48:09.283
I'll kill you, you bitch. You crazy cunt!

48:09.786 --> 48:10.946
Get out!

48:34.478 --> 48:36.742
It's gotta be on here somewhere.

48:37.347 --> 48:39.474
<i>...scuffle at the Columbus Day parade
in Newark.</i>

48:39.549 --> 48:42.040
<i>Among those arrested
for blocking a fire lane...</i>

48:42.119 --> 48:44.053
<i>was Native American activist Del Redclay...</i>

48:44.121 --> 48:46.282
<i>who caled the protest
an unqualified success.</i>

48:46.356 --> 48:49.086
<i>Elsewhere, a blind river rafter
is going to get her wish...</i>

48:49.159 --> 48:52.026
<i>after suing for a place
in the Colorado River...</i>

48:52.095 --> 48:54.029
I should've been there.

48:56.667 --> 48:59.966
I would've been fucking there.
I forgot this was a Monday.

49:04.942 --> 49:09.003
- Maybe we ought to just whack this prick.
- Who the fuck are you kidding?

49:09.146 --> 49:11.671
All you thought about was blackjack.

49:11.982 --> 49:15.418
What? You think this day in the country
was free, don't you?

49:15.953 --> 49:17.443
Well, it wasn't.

49:17.521 --> 49:21.048
Fucking Chief Smith wants Frankie Valli
to come up there and play a week.

49:21.124 --> 49:23.991
That's what this whole fucking junket
was about.

49:24.161 --> 49:26.254
- Frankie?
- Yeah, that's right.

49:26.330 --> 49:29.026
That's why he buttonholed me, goddamn it.

49:29.099 --> 49:30.964
There's bad blood with Frankie's manager.

49:31.034 --> 49:35.232
So the Chief wants me to call him
as payback for him reaching out to Redclay.

49:35.305 --> 49:37.398
Well, you're gonna make the fucking call.

49:37.474 --> 49:41.570
- I ain't seen Frankie for years...
- Tough shit! You're making the fucking call!

49:41.645 --> 49:44.273
You and this fucking parade, already.

49:52.289 --> 49:54.621
I don't know what you're so hot about.

49:54.691 --> 49:58.525
They discriminate against all Italians
as a group when they disallow Columbus...

49:58.595 --> 50:01.359
Will you fucking stop? "Group"!

50:05.869 --> 50:09.965
What the fuck happened to Gary Cooper?
That's what I'd like to know.

50:10.607 --> 50:11.904
He died.

50:12.943 --> 50:15.776
You mean, 'cause he fought the Sioux
in all those westerns?

50:15.846 --> 50:17.313
Fuck that.

50:18.448 --> 50:19.847
Gary Cooper.

50:20.250 --> 50:21.979
Now there was an American.

50:22.252 --> 50:25.449
The strong, silent type.
He did what he had to do.

50:25.655 --> 50:27.054
He faced down the Miller gang...

50:27.124 --> 50:30.252
when none of those other assholes
would lift a finger to help him.

50:30.327 --> 50:33.956
And did he complain? Did he say,
"I come from this poor Texas-Irish...

50:34.031 --> 50:37.330
"illiterate background or whatever,
so leave me the fuck out of it...

50:37.401 --> 50:39.301
"because my people got fucked over"?

50:39.369 --> 50:41.337
T, not for nothing...

50:41.705 --> 50:44.071
but you're getting a little confused here.

50:44.141 --> 50:45.870
That was the movies.

50:45.942 --> 50:47.671
What difference does that make?

50:47.744 --> 50:51.578
Columbus was so long ago,
he might as well have been a fucking movie.

50:51.648 --> 50:53.309
Images, you said.

50:54.051 --> 50:56.212
The point is, Gary Cooper...

50:57.054 --> 50:58.817
the real Gary Cooper...

50:59.456 --> 51:02.789
or anybody named Cooper,
never suffered like the Italians.

51:03.560 --> 51:07.018
<i>A madigan like him,
they fucked everybody else.</i>

51:07.731 --> 51:10.359
The Italians, the Polacks, the Blacks.

51:10.600 --> 51:13.125
<i>All right, even if he was a madigan
around nowadays...</i>

51:13.203 --> 51:15.797
he'd be a member of some victims' group.

51:15.872 --> 51:19.933
The fundamentalist Christians,
the abused cowboys, the gays, whatever.

51:20.010 --> 51:23.468
- He was gay, Gary Cooper?
- No! Are you listening to me?

51:24.314 --> 51:26.373
Hey, people suffered.

51:27.350 --> 51:28.510
Did you?

51:28.718 --> 51:30.549
Except for maybe the feds.

51:30.620 --> 51:34.647
My grandparents got spit on
because they were from Calabria.

51:34.724 --> 51:38.490
Let me ask you a question.
All the good things you got in your life...

51:38.562 --> 51:41.326
did they come to you
'cause you're Calabrese?

51:43.033 --> 51:45.729
I'll tell you the answer. The answer is no.

51:45.802 --> 51:48.134
You got a smart kid at Lackawanna College.

51:48.205 --> 51:52.301
You got a wife who's a piece of ass.
At least she was when you married her.

51:52.375 --> 51:55.606
You own one of the most profitable
topless bars in North Jersey.

51:55.679 --> 51:57.544
Did you get all this 'cause you're Italian?

51:57.614 --> 52:01.812
No, you got it 'cause you're you,
'cause you're smart, 'cause you're whatever.

52:03.453 --> 52:05.614
Where the fuck is our self-esteem?

52:06.223 --> 52:11.092
<i>That shit doesn't come from Columbus,
or The Godfather, or Chef fucking Boyardee.</i>

52:13.630 --> 52:16.497
We gotta tiptoe around the Indians though,
don't we?

52:16.566 --> 52:19.626
We can't call our teams
the Braves or the Tomahawks or the...

52:19.703 --> 52:22.934
You take it up with Frankie Valli
when you talk to him.
