01:18.867 --> 01:20.233
Actually, despite our best

01:20.233 --> 01:22.133
intentions, our system is way

01:22.133 --> 01:23.800
less democratic than we think.

Wow, thank you, Donna.

01:50.600 --> 01:52.933
Now, so, every four years, we

01:52.933 --> 01:54.467
hear the words "electoral

01:54.467 --> 01:56.233
college" over and over again.

01:56.233 --> 01:57.400
But, we never talk about what

01:57.400 --> 01:59.033
a ridiculous and, frankly,

01:59.033 --> 02:00.433
undemocratic system it

02:00.433 --> 02:01.200
really is.

02:01.200 --> 02:02.633
The electoral college gives

02:02.633 --> 02:04.467
vastly more power to different

02:04.467 --> 02:05.733
voters, depending on which state

02:05.733 --> 02:06.567
they live in.

02:06.567 --> 02:07.733
Bigger states?

02:07.733 --> 02:08.967
Nope, smaller states.

02:08.967 --> 02:10.767
If your state has less people,

02:10.767 --> 02:12.567
you have more power.

02:12.567 --> 02:13.667
Not too many people live in

02:13.700 --> 02:15.067
Wyoming, but they have three

02:15.067 --> 02:16.733
electoral votes, or one for

02:16.733 --> 02:19.433
every 135,000 voters.

02:19.433 --> 02:20.767
California is packed with

02:20.767 --> 02:22.800
people, but they have 55

02:22.800 --> 02:24.533
electoral votes, or one for

02:24.533 --> 02:26.933
every 411,000 voters.

02:26.933 --> 02:27.800
And that's totally out of

02:27.800 --> 02:28.900
proportion, because it means it

02:28.900 --> 02:30.267
takes three times as many

02:30.267 --> 02:31.900
Californians to earn one

02:31.900 --> 02:33.733
electoral vote, giving voters in

02:33.733 --> 02:35.567
Wyoming three times the power in

02:35.567 --> 02:36.900
the electoral college.

02:36.900 --> 02:38.533
As a result of this system, your

02:38.533 --> 02:40.033
vote could count for less just

02:40.067 --> 02:42.067
because of where you live.

02:42.067 --> 02:43.867
Infographics rule, right?

02:43.867 --> 02:45.067
Yeah, well, it does seem

02:45.067 --> 02:46.533
unfair, but who cares if the

02:46.533 --> 02:48.133
electoral college is kooky?

02:48.133 --> 02:48.800
I'm kooky.

02:48.800 --> 02:49.800
I have two turtles.

02:49.800 --> 02:51.100
Okay, well, it gets worse,

02:51.100 --> 02:52.567
because the electoral college

02:52.567 --> 02:54.700
also creates swing states.

02:54.700 --> 02:56.400
Oh, I love the swing states!

02:56.400 --> 02:57.633
They make election night so

02:57.633 --> 02:58.900
exciting, kind of like when my

02:58.900 --> 03:00.400
turtles move a little.

03:00.400 --> 03:01.700
Wha-- Exciting?

03:01.700 --> 03:03.067
I think the fact that the entire

03:03.067 --> 03:04.267
election is determined by just

03:04.267 --> 03:06.300
a handful of states is really

03:06.300 --> 03:07.033
messed up.

03:07.033 --> 03:08.067
For one thing, it means

03:08.067 --> 03:09.267
presidential candidates can

03:09.267 --> 03:10.900
ignore almost the entire

03:10.900 --> 03:12.867

03:31.567 --> 03:32.700
I don't know many actors.

03:32.700 --> 03:34.567
Anyway, swing states have so

03:34.567 --> 03:36.067
much power that in recent

03:36.067 --> 03:38.767
elections, up to 80% of all the

03:38.767 --> 03:40.700
votes cast in America had no

03:40.700 --> 03:42.233
impact on the outcome.

03:42.233 --> 03:43.433
That includes your vote here in

03:43.433 --> 03:44.300

03:44.300 --> 03:45.267
Well, some states are red

03:45.267 --> 03:46.700

03:46.700 --> 03:47.367
states.

03:47.367 --> 03:48.800
That's the way America is.

03:48.800 --> 03:50.533

04:11.400 --> 04:12.400
If electoral votes were

04:12.400 --> 04:13.600
awarded proportionately,

04:13.600 --> 04:16.567
in 2012, 16 of Texas's electoral

04:16.567 --> 04:18.067
votes would have gone to Obama,

04:18.067 --> 04:19.933

04:19.933 --> 04:21.300
have gone to Romney.

04:21.300 --> 04:22.400

04:34.600 --> 04:36.067
Oh, these are the electors.

They're the people who actually

I thought the electoral

college was just a name.

04:41.100 --> 04:42.067
Oh, nope!

04:42.067 --> 04:43.467
When we vote, we're actually

04:43.467 --> 04:44.600
just picking our state's

04:44.600 --> 04:45.533
electors.

04:45.567 --> 04:46.400
Then, those electors get

04:46.400 --> 04:48.067
together and cast their ballots

04:48.067 --> 04:49.567
for president.

04:49.567 --> 04:51.200
But, who are they?

04:51.233 --> 04:52.733
Oh, mostly retired

04:52.733 --> 04:54.267
politicians and party flaks.

Okay, Mr. Smarty, that's just

04:59.733 --> 05:00.900
a technicality.

05:00.900 --> 05:02.233
They have to vote for who

05:02.233 --> 05:03.467
we choose.

05:03.467 --> 05:05.533
Actually, in 24 states,

05:05.533 --> 05:07.033
they can vote for whoever

05:07.067 --> 05:09.200
they want.

05:09.233 --> 05:10.600
And that's happened over

05:10.600 --> 05:11.800
80 times.

05:11.800 --> 05:14.267
In 2004, an elector in Minnesota

05:14.267 --> 05:16.200
cast his vote for someone named

05:16.233 --> 05:18.867
"John Ewards"... which was

05:18.867 --> 05:20.600
almost the name of John Kerry's

05:20.600 --> 05:21.533
running mate.

05:21.567 --> 05:23.100
Did you mean "John Edwards"?

05:23.100 --> 05:24.600
Yes. (chuckling)

05:24.600 --> 05:27.967
I may have a drinking problem.

05:27.967 --> 05:29.300
That actually happened?

05:29.300 --> 05:31.067
That actually happened.

05:31.067 --> 05:32.700
That elector's vote didn't go to

05:32.700 --> 05:33.467
John Kerry.

05:33.467 --> 05:35.067
It went to the guy running for

05:35.067 --> 05:36.400
vice-president.

05:36.400 --> 05:37.733
The electoral college is such

05:37.733 --> 05:39.133
a bad system, people have been

05:39.133 --> 05:40.067
trying to abolish it for

05:40.067 --> 05:40.733
centuries...

05:40.733 --> 05:41.400
Oh.

05:41.400 --> 05:42.100
But, so far, it's been

05:42.100 --> 05:43.567
politically impossible.

05:43.567 --> 05:44.633
Okay, well, thank you for the

05:44.633 --> 05:45.433
information.

05:45.433 --> 05:46.867
I cannot believe our beautiful

05:46.867 --> 05:49.367
system has become so messed up.

05:49.367 --> 05:50.767
Oh, no, the founding fathers

05:50.767 --> 05:51.900
designed our system this

05:51.900 --> 05:53.233
messed up. (chuckling)

All right, hold on a minute,

05:54.900 --> 05:55.800
young man.

05:55.800 --> 05:57.067
You do not talk about the

05:57.067 --> 05:58.733
founding fathers like that.

05:58.733 --> 06:00.200
They were brilliant men, who

06:00.200 --> 06:01.233
fought hard for my right

06:01.233 --> 06:01.933
to vote.

06:01.933 --> 06:02.900
Actually, the founding

06:02.900 --> 06:03.967
fathers didn't think you should

06:03.967 --> 06:05.033
be able to vote at all.

06:05.033 --> 06:05.967
Or me.

06:05.967 --> 06:08.067
Or most Americans. (chuckling)

And this is...?

06:41.433 --> 06:42.567
Oh, hey, Ed!

06:42.567 --> 06:44.267
Uh, Donna, this is Ed Ayers.

06:46.967 --> 06:47.733
a little research.

06:47.733 --> 06:48.467
So, you brought us somebody

06:48.467 --> 06:49.733
else to introduce to the

06:49.733 --> 06:50.633
founding fathers' era?

06:50.633 --> 06:51.533
Yeah, you want to tell her

06:51.533 --> 06:52.300
about 'em?

06:52.300 --> 06:52.967
The story is a little

06:52.967 --> 06:53.767
discouraging.

06:53.767 --> 06:55.433
We revere the founding fathers,

06:55.433 --> 06:57.200
as we should, but their ideas of

06:57.200 --> 06:58.733
democracy were just a little bit

06:58.733 --> 06:59.800
different from ours.

06:59.800 --> 07:01.400
Oh, I cannot believe that.

07:01.400 --> 07:02.800
Oh, well, see for yourself.

07:02.800 --> 07:03.467
They're creating our election

07:03.467 --> 07:04.133
system.

07:04.133 --> 07:04.800
(gavel banging)

07:04.800 --> 07:06.233
Gentlemen, I submit to you,

07:06.233 --> 07:08.133
good sirs, that we structure

07:08.133 --> 07:12.100
America as a direct democracy,

07:12.100 --> 07:13.900
one where every person votes

07:13.900 --> 07:16.467
directly for president.

07:16.467 --> 07:17.967
(Donna clapping alone)

07:17.967 --> 07:19.100
Psych!

07:19.100 --> 07:20.467
J/K, boys!

07:20.467 --> 07:22.133
That would be ridiculous!

07:22.133 --> 07:23.367
(laughter)

07:23.367 --> 07:25.033
That-- that can't be!

07:25.033 --> 07:26.367
Adams, you believed it.

07:26.367 --> 07:27.033
You believed it!

07:27.033 --> 07:27.700
I saw your face!

07:27.700 --> 07:28.633
Why didn't they want direct

07:28.633 --> 07:29.633
democracy?

07:29.633 --> 07:30.300
Honestly?

07:30.300 --> 07:31.933
They didn't trust us to vote

07:31.933 --> 07:32.600
correctly.

07:32.600 --> 07:34.267
Put yourself in their shoes.

07:34.267 --> 07:35.400
They're creating a new country.

07:35.400 --> 07:36.300
They're not sure what's gonna

07:36.300 --> 07:37.033
happen.

07:37.033 --> 07:37.867
They're kind of worried about

07:37.867 --> 07:39.233
too much democracy, and they

07:39.233 --> 07:40.300
think it's be a good idea,

07:40.300 --> 07:41.800
maybe, for there to be a buffer

07:41.800 --> 07:43.100
between the people and the

07:43.100 --> 07:43.767
government.

07:43.767 --> 07:45.533
The common man could vote for

07:45.533 --> 07:47.033
the king of England, or a

07:47.033 --> 07:49.967
demagogue, or, like, little bugs

07:49.967 --> 07:50.633
or something.

07:50.633 --> 07:51.300
I don't know.

07:51.300 --> 07:53.300
They're very, very dumb people.

07:53.300 --> 07:55.633
How about, we have the people

07:55.633 --> 07:58.633
choose electors, and then they

07:58.633 --> 07:59.767
pick the president?

07:59.767 --> 08:01.867
Like, I don't know, the

08:01.867 --> 08:02.733
governor's rich cousin can

08:02.733 --> 08:03.400
do it.

08:03.400 --> 08:04.567
Oh, how condescending.

08:04.567 --> 08:06.133
Yeah, they kind of were.

08:06.133 --> 08:07.567
And, there was one particular

08:07.567 --> 08:08.867
group of states that rallied

08:08.867 --> 08:10.233
really hard against direct

08:10.233 --> 08:11.033
democracy.

08:11.033 --> 08:12.467
The smaller states?

08:12.467 --> 08:13.300
Not quite.

08:13.300 --> 08:15.033
Yeah, y'all, it would be

08:15.033 --> 08:16.533
great for us to have

08:16.533 --> 08:18.600
representative democracy that

08:18.600 --> 08:20.300
gave us credit for the

08:20.300 --> 08:23.467
population of our states.

08:23.467 --> 08:24.800
Even if some of those people

08:24.800 --> 08:26.533
aren't actually voting, if you,

08:26.533 --> 08:28.433
uh, catch my meaning.

08:28.433 --> 08:30.533
(coughing) Slaves!

08:30.533 --> 08:32.133
He's talking about slaves!

08:32.133 --> 08:33.633
Are you saying the slave states

08:33.633 --> 08:34.600
are responsible for the

08:34.600 --> 08:35.867
electoral college?

08:35.867 --> 08:37.067
Well, to a considerable

08:37.067 --> 08:38.067
extent.

08:38.067 --> 08:39.933
Slave states were very powerful.

08:39.933 --> 08:41.267
If you're gonna have a "United"

08:41.267 --> 08:42.633
States, you're gonna have to

08:42.633 --> 08:43.633
make concessions to bring

08:43.633 --> 08:44.367
them in.

08:44.367 --> 08:45.567
Yeah, look, the founding

08:45.567 --> 08:46.800
fathers weren't benevolent

08:46.800 --> 08:47.600
demigods.

08:47.600 --> 08:48.800
They were humans who made

08:48.800 --> 08:50.433
compromises and mistakes.

08:50.433 --> 08:51.767
And building a compromise with

08:51.767 --> 08:53.300
slavery into the structure of

08:53.300 --> 08:55.433
our government was one of them.

08:55.433 --> 08:56.467
Would you excuse me for just

08:56.467 --> 08:57.133
a minute?

08:57.133 --> 08:57.967
Sure.

08:57.967 --> 09:00.400
Mr. Conover, that is enough.

09:00.400 --> 09:02.367
I may not know everything, but

09:02.367 --> 09:03.900
I passionately believe that

09:03.900 --> 09:06.200
reading is fundamental, and that

09:06.200 --> 09:07.867
Gordon Ramsay's wit is

09:07.867 --> 09:10.033
underappreciated, and that even

09:10.033 --> 09:12.067
though the founding fathers may

09:12.067 --> 09:13.967
not have been perfect, they are

09:13.967 --> 09:16.867
still noble and brave men who

09:16.867 --> 09:19.367
believed that every citizen has

09:19.367 --> 09:23.133
a right to vote, so help me God.

09:23.133 --> 09:24.133
Oh, no, they didn't think

09:24.133 --> 09:25.033
that you should be able to vote

09:25.033 --> 09:26.267
at all.

09:26.267 --> 09:28.133
Right, because I'm a woman.

09:28.133 --> 09:29.600
Oh, no, because you don't

09:29.600 --> 09:30.300
own land.

09:30.300 --> 09:31.433
Also, because you're a woman.

09:31.433 --> 09:32.300
Yeah.

09:32.300 --> 09:35.867
All men are created equal...

09:35.867 --> 09:37.633
if they have land.

09:37.633 --> 09:38.467
Like this guy.

09:38.467 --> 09:39.267
He owns a farm.

09:39.267 --> 09:40.433
He's equal to me.

09:40.433 --> 09:41.967
Not so much, the rest of you.

09:41.967 --> 09:43.700
You're... not quite people.

09:43.700 --> 09:46.267
Whoo, farm boys for life!

09:46.267 --> 09:48.133
Farmers only! Get!

09:48.133 --> 09:48.800
Really?

09:48.800 --> 09:50.367
They... really thought that?

09:50.367 --> 09:51.033
Oh, yeah.

09:51.033 --> 09:51.700
We did.

09:51.700 --> 09:52.967
Ask the historian.

09:52.967 --> 09:54.433
Yeah, I'm sorry, Donna.

09:54.433 --> 09:56.400
It's true.

09:56.400 --> 09:57.467
This is why you should never

09:57.467 --> 09:58.900
meet your heroes.

09:58.900 --> 09:59.800
When the founding fathers

09:59.800 --> 10:01.633
created our democracy, they gave

10:01.633 --> 10:03.933
the vote to just 6% of the

10:03.933 --> 10:05.100
population.

10:05.100 --> 10:06.633
And it took a long time to

10:06.633 --> 10:08.400
change that.

10:08.400 --> 10:10.533
(beeping, whirring)

10:10.567 --> 10:13.267
It took almost 70 years before

10:13.267 --> 10:14.633
the right to vote was extended

10:14.633 --> 10:16.100
even to just all white men.

10:16.100 --> 10:16.767
(dinging)

10:16.767 --> 10:18.233
White men rule.

10:18.267 --> 10:19.467
(all) White men rule!

10:19.467 --> 10:20.133
Here we go!

10:20.133 --> 10:21.133
White men rule!

10:21.133 --> 10:22.467
That's a bad chant.

10:22.467 --> 10:24.367
And then 14 years later, the

10:24.367 --> 10:25.967
Fifteenth Amendment finally gave

10:25.967 --> 10:27.567
black men the right to vote.

10:27.567 --> 10:28.600
(beeping)

10:28.633 --> 10:30.400
This will last forever!

10:30.400 --> 10:31.067
(laughing)

10:31.067 --> 10:31.733
Whoo!

10:31.733 --> 10:33.500
Yeah! (laughing)

10:33.533 --> 10:34.467
It didn't.

10:34.467 --> 10:36.100
Soon after that, states passed

10:36.100 --> 10:37.700
Jim Crow laws that made it

10:37.700 --> 10:39.300
virtually impossible for black

10:39.300 --> 10:40.700
Americans to vote.

10:40.733 --> 10:41.467
(beeping)

10:41.467 --> 10:43.367
I genuinely don't understand

10:43.367 --> 10:44.633
how we justify this to

10:44.633 --> 10:45.433
ourselves!

10:45.433 --> 10:46.567
(laughter)

10:46.600 --> 10:47.467
Awful.

10:47.467 --> 10:49.433
And, in 1920, women finally

10:49.433 --> 10:50.433
got the franchise.

10:50.467 --> 10:51.100
(beeping)

10:51.100 --> 10:52.400
Female president,

10:52.400 --> 10:53.667
here we come!

10:53.700 --> 10:55.300
(cheering)

10:55.300 --> 10:56.967
Get ready to wait, honey.

10:56.967 --> 10:59.800
And 45 years after that, the

10:59.800 --> 11:02.200
Voting Rights Act of 1965

11:02.200 --> 11:03.767
finally secured African

11:03.767 --> 11:05.633
Americans' right to vote.

11:05.633 --> 11:07.067
(beeping)

11:07.067 --> 11:09.433
Which brings us to the present.

11:09.433 --> 11:10.300
Who are all these people?

11:10.300 --> 11:12.267
I thought everyone could vote.

11:12.267 --> 11:13.367
Unfortunately not.

11:13.367 --> 11:14.967
There are still millions of

11:14.967 --> 11:17.133
American citizens who pay taxes

11:17.133 --> 11:19.233
and don't have representation.

11:19.233 --> 11:20.933
Those suffering without suffrage

11:20.933 --> 11:22.133
include the citizens of

11:22.133 --> 11:23.300
Washington, D.C...

11:23.300 --> 11:26.467
650,000 people live in D.C.

11:26.467 --> 11:27.467
and have no representation in

11:27.467 --> 11:28.133
Congress.

11:28.133 --> 11:28.967
(scoffing) Come on!

11:28.967 --> 11:30.300
And America's territories,

11:30.300 --> 11:31.400
like American Samoa,

11:31.400 --> 11:32.700
Puerto Rico, and Guam.

11:32.700 --> 11:33.867
We're American citizens.

11:33.867 --> 11:34.567
Jeez!

11:34.567 --> 11:35.300
And it gets worse--

11:35.300 --> 11:36.467
Worse, of course it does.

11:36.467 --> 11:37.700
What other nice people

11:37.700 --> 11:38.367
can't vote?

11:38.367 --> 11:40.300
Nuns, volunteers in nursing

11:40.300 --> 11:41.800
homes, Tom Hanks?

11:41.800 --> 11:43.133
Nope-- felons!

11:43.133 --> 11:44.733
In many states, felons are

11:44.733 --> 11:46.567
barred from voting for the rest

11:46.567 --> 11:47.867
of their lives, even after

11:47.867 --> 11:48.733
they're released.

11:48.733 --> 11:49.900
Well, isn't that a...

11:49.900 --> 11:51.367
good thing?

11:51.367 --> 11:52.767
I mean, maybe they

11:52.767 --> 11:53.767
shouldn't vote.

11:53.767 --> 11:54.800
Why?

11:54.800 --> 11:56.267
I served my time.

11:56.267 --> 11:56.967
What's the worst that could

11:56.967 --> 11:58.100
happen?

11:58.100 --> 11:59.967
(cackling)

11:59.967 --> 12:01.267
I just voted to make crime

12:01.267 --> 12:02.033
legal.

12:02.033 --> 12:04.467
It's "Purge" time, baby!

12:04.467 --> 12:05.133
Haa!

12:05.133 --> 12:06.967
Lady, that's preposterous.

12:06.967 --> 12:07.733
You have to vote for

12:07.733 --> 12:09.233
a candidate.

12:09.233 --> 12:10.533
I'm actually registered

12:10.533 --> 12:11.267
Green Party.

12:11.267 --> 12:12.800
Oh, gosh.

12:12.800 --> 12:14.200
You've got a good point there.

12:14.200 --> 12:16.033
Maybe I'm convinced.

12:16.033 --> 12:17.233
You know, guys, this topic

12:17.233 --> 12:18.533
has a really interesting

12:18.533 --> 12:19.200
history.

12:19.200 --> 12:20.433
Oh, yeah, good point, Ed.

12:20.433 --> 12:21.867
To learn more, let's go back in

12:21.867 --> 12:23.267
time to the Jim Crow South.

12:23.267 --> 12:24.800
I said I was convinced!

12:24.800 --> 12:26.800
(thunder crashing)

12:26.800 --> 12:28.067
(Adam) Here we are.

12:28.067 --> 12:29.800
Yeah, for 100 years in the

12:29.800 --> 12:31.567
Jim Crow South, white

12:31.567 --> 12:32.967
Southerners did everything they

12:32.967 --> 12:34.633
could to keep black Southerners

12:34.633 --> 12:35.300
from voting.

12:35.300 --> 12:36.067
Go on home.

12:36.067 --> 12:37.933
They would take minor crimes

12:37.933 --> 12:39.467
and turn them into felonies,

12:39.467 --> 12:41.567
and then pass laws saying that

12:41.567 --> 12:42.933
felons can't vote.

12:42.933 --> 12:44.067
I'd like to vote, please.

12:44.067 --> 12:45.200
Are you a felon?

12:45.200 --> 12:47.133
No, sir.

12:47.133 --> 12:49.033
Well, you are now, standing

12:49.033 --> 12:51.300
around this line like a vagrant.

12:51.300 --> 12:52.633
Let's go!

12:52.633 --> 12:54.067
How awful.

12:54.067 --> 12:55.367
Thank God all those laws have

12:55.367 --> 12:56.433
been repealed.

12:56.433 --> 12:57.600
I hate to tell you this,

12:57.600 --> 12:59.367
Donna, but a lot of laws like

12:59.367 --> 13:00.800
that are still on the books

13:00.800 --> 13:01.467
today.

13:01.467 --> 13:02.800
And they're still stopping

13:02.800 --> 13:04.600
African Americans from voting.

13:04.600 --> 13:07.600
Here, I'll show you.

13:07.600 --> 13:10.300
(energy crackling)

13:10.300 --> 13:12.300
Donna, this is Daryl Atkinson,

13:12.300 --> 13:13.733
a senior staff attorney at the

13:13.767 --> 13:14.800
Southern Coalition for Social

13:14.800 --> 13:15.467
Justice.

13:15.467 --> 13:16.200
Hey, how you doing, Donna?

13:16.200 --> 13:16.800
Hi.

13:16.800 --> 13:17.567
Adam, I've gotta go to court.

13:17.567 --> 13:18.233
Yeah, but, you could take

13:18.267 --> 13:19.367
a second to tell Donna your

13:19.367 --> 13:20.300
story, right?

13:20.300 --> 13:21.100
Sure.

13:21.100 --> 13:23.267
In 1996, I was convicted of a

13:23.267 --> 13:24.467
first-time, non-violent

13:24.467 --> 13:25.133
drug crime.

13:25.133 --> 13:26.600
I was sentenced to ten years in

13:26.600 --> 13:28.733
prison, spent almost four years

13:28.733 --> 13:30.467
there, and once I got out, I was

13:30.467 --> 13:32.267
able to get my education, get my

13:32.267 --> 13:34.067
bachelor's degree, law degree.

13:34.067 --> 13:35.367
I'm licensed to practice law in

13:35.367 --> 13:36.300
two different states.

13:36.300 --> 13:37.467
Been even honored at the

13:37.467 --> 13:39.033
White House by the president.

13:39.033 --> 13:40.467
But I still can't vote in my

13:40.467 --> 13:41.233
home state.

13:41.233 --> 13:43.133
And this doesn't just affect me.

13:43.133 --> 13:44.467
Because African Americans are

13:44.467 --> 13:46.067
disproportionately arrested for

13:46.067 --> 13:48.400
non-violent crimes, 13% of

13:48.400 --> 13:49.767
African American males in this

13:49.767 --> 13:51.367
country can't vote because of

13:51.367 --> 13:52.967
felon disenfranchisement laws.

13:52.967 --> 13:54.633
The bottom line is, Jim Crow

13:54.633 --> 13:56.133
laws that are still on the books

13:56.133 --> 13:58.200
are stopping 5 million Americans

13:58.200 --> 13:59.467
like Daryl from voting

13:59.467 --> 14:00.633
every year.

14:00.633 --> 14:01.633
It's deplorable.

14:01.633 --> 14:02.433
I agree.

14:02.433 --> 14:03.633
I gotta run, guys.

14:03.633 --> 14:04.467
Thank you, Daryl.

14:04.467 --> 14:06.367
Come on.

14:06.367 --> 14:07.933
We need to do something.

14:07.933 --> 14:09.467
We need to extend the vote to

14:09.467 --> 14:10.933
those people.

14:10.933 --> 14:11.800
I know!

14:11.800 --> 14:12.867
I'll vote for a candidate who

14:12.867 --> 14:14.133
will support that.

14:14.133 --> 14:15.600
Take me back to the polling

14:15.600 --> 14:16.267
place.

14:16.267 --> 14:17.533
That is a wonderful idea,

14:17.533 --> 14:18.200
Donna.

14:18.200 --> 14:18.867
(beeping)

14:18.867 --> 14:19.867
Too bad the political parties

14:19.867 --> 14:20.767
have rigged the system to

14:20.767 --> 14:21.600
determine the outcome of

14:21.600 --> 14:22.600
elections before they even

14:22.600 --> 14:23.467
happen.

14:23.467 --> 14:25.100
No!

14:25.100 --> 14:26.033
And I'll tell you about it

14:26.033 --> 14:26.800
tonight, on

14:26.800 --> 14:28.133
"Adam Ruins Everything,"

14:28.133 --> 14:30.067
Election Night Edition.

14:30.067 --> 14:31.733
I vote you take me home!

14:31.733 --> 14:32.700
(whistling)

14:35.800 --> 14:36.833
♪♪

14:36.867 --> 14:38.200
Tonight, on "Election Night

14:38.200 --> 14:40.067
in America, Decision Country,

14:40.067 --> 14:41.700
USA."

14:41.733 --> 14:43.367
American democracy has never

14:43.367 --> 14:44.133
been perfect.

14:44.133 --> 14:45.200
Throughout our history,

14:45.200 --> 14:46.700
politicians and parties have

14:46.700 --> 14:48.800
used undemocratic, often even

14:48.800 --> 14:50.133
fraudulent means, to get

14:50.133 --> 14:50.867
elected.

14:50.867 --> 14:52.700
I don't want to hear it.

14:52.700 --> 14:53.967
You're no Don Lemon.

14:53.967 --> 14:56.033
Can I vote, please?

14:56.033 --> 14:57.533
In the 19th century, people

14:57.533 --> 14:58.933
would just sell their votes

14:58.933 --> 15:00.500
outright, and make bank

15:00.533 --> 15:01.933
traveling from state to state

15:01.933 --> 15:03.033
being paid to vote.

15:05.067 --> 15:08.200
Democracy sure is sweet.

15:08.200 --> 15:09.033
Well, thank goodness that was

15:09.033 --> 15:10.533
a long time ago.

15:10.533 --> 15:11.733
Oh, no, election fraud was

15:11.733 --> 15:13.033
common practice well into the

15:13.033 --> 15:14.300
20th century.

15:14.300 --> 15:15.800
LBJ won his first Senate

15:15.800 --> 15:17.600
election by buying the votes of

15:17.600 --> 15:19.267
entire districts, and was

15:19.267 --> 15:20.700
finally put over the top when

15:20.700 --> 15:21.800
a corrupt election worker

15:21.800 --> 15:23.867
changed a "7" to a "9."

15:23.867 --> 15:25.533
Let's go to Texas.

15:25.533 --> 15:26.633
What's the total for Johnson

15:26.633 --> 15:27.933
here in Jim Wells County?

15:27.933 --> 15:31.533
Uh, LBJ got 765 votes.

15:31.533 --> 15:32.200
(cash register dinging)

15:32.200 --> 15:35.033
Oh!

15:35.033 --> 15:38.533
LBJ got 965 votes!

15:38.533 --> 15:39.700
Back to you, me.

15:39.700 --> 15:40.733
So, things are better now,

15:40.733 --> 15:41.700
right?

15:41.700 --> 15:42.633
Tell me they're better now.

15:42.633 --> 15:43.300
Nope!

15:43.300 --> 15:45.133
To this day, political parties

15:45.133 --> 15:46.533
pick the winners of elections

15:46.533 --> 15:48.300
before they even happen.

15:48.300 --> 15:49.300
It's a process called

15:49.300 --> 15:50.667
"gerrymandering," and it's

15:50.700 --> 15:52.033
totally legal.

15:52.033 --> 15:53.133
Oh, gerrymandering.

15:53.133 --> 15:54.367
That's a word I've heard, and

15:54.367 --> 15:55.967
I hate it, and I have no idea

15:55.967 --> 15:56.633
what it means.

15:56.633 --> 15:57.867
Oh, I'll explain it to you.

15:57.867 --> 16:00.033
Every 10 years, politicians

16:00.033 --> 16:01.400
redraw the districts that pick

16:01.400 --> 16:02.700
the House and state

16:02.700 --> 16:03.700
legislatures.

16:03.733 --> 16:04.867
But, here's the problem.

16:04.867 --> 16:06.300
The politicians that are elected

16:06.300 --> 16:08.233
by those districts are the same

16:08.233 --> 16:09.800
politicians that redraw the

16:09.800 --> 16:10.533
districts.

16:10.533 --> 16:11.867
It's an insane conflict of

16:11.867 --> 16:13.233
interest, because it allows

16:13.233 --> 16:14.967
political parties to choose the

16:14.967 --> 16:17.200
outcomes of elections years in

16:17.200 --> 16:17.867
advance.

16:17.867 --> 16:20.700
Look, say that 40% of the voters

16:20.700 --> 16:22.067
here in "Newstateadelphia" are

16:22.067 --> 16:24.100
member of the Yellow Party.

16:24.133 --> 16:25.033
The Yellow Party believes

16:25.033 --> 16:26.933
that all gays must own guns.

16:26.933 --> 16:28.867
And the other 60% are members

16:28.867 --> 16:30.200
of the Purple Party.

16:30.200 --> 16:31.100
The Purple Party believes

16:31.100 --> 16:32.867
that all guns are gay.

16:32.867 --> 16:34.167
Now, if you divided this

16:34.200 --> 16:35.567
state into districts fairly,

16:35.567 --> 16:36.600
you'd get perfect

16:36.600 --> 16:38.367
representation, three Purple

16:38.367 --> 16:39.800
districts, and two Yellow

16:39.800 --> 16:40.533
districts.

16:40.533 --> 16:41.300
Seems fair.

16:41.300 --> 16:42.200
It is.

16:42.200 --> 16:43.400
But, if the Purple Party is

16:43.400 --> 16:44.800
allowed to redraw the districts,

16:44.800 --> 16:46.533
they can do this.

16:46.533 --> 16:48.700
Five Purple districts, and zero

16:48.733 --> 16:50.267
Yellow districts.

16:50.267 --> 16:51.700
Now, we can pass a law

16:51.700 --> 16:53.867
requiring babies to vape.

16:53.900 --> 16:55.400
And if the Yellow Party is

16:55.400 --> 16:56.633
allowed to redraw the districts,

16:56.633 --> 16:57.867
they can do it like this.

16:57.900 --> 17:00.033
Three Yellow districts, and two

17:00.033 --> 17:01.067
Purple districts.

17:01.067 --> 17:01.967
Now we can give the death

17:01.967 --> 17:03.200
penalty to all people named

17:03.200 --> 17:03.967
Trevor.

17:03.967 --> 17:05.400
The Yellow Party hates Trevors.

17:05.400 --> 17:06.467
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

17:06.467 --> 17:08.033
As a proud Trevor American...

17:08.067 --> 17:09.400
Even though the Yellow Party

17:09.400 --> 17:10.600
has less voters in

17:10.600 --> 17:12.100
Newstateadelphia, if they're

17:12.100 --> 17:13.733
allowed to redraw the lines

17:13.733 --> 17:15.067
however they want, they can

17:15.067 --> 17:16.100
still win.

17:16.100 --> 17:17.700
And this happens every election

17:17.700 --> 17:19.033
year in America.

17:19.033 --> 17:20.367
That sounds like cheating.

17:20.367 --> 17:21.033
Oh!

17:21.033 --> 17:22.267
That's exactly what it is.

17:22.267 --> 17:23.633
In 2012, Pennsylvania

17:23.633 --> 17:25.433
Republicans lost the popular

17:25.433 --> 17:28.800
vote, but they still won 72% of

17:28.800 --> 17:30.233
the seats in their state by

17:30.233 --> 17:31.933
drawing weird looking districts

17:31.933 --> 17:33.100
like this.

17:33.100 --> 17:34.433
And, Maryland Democrats did the

17:34.433 --> 17:36.133
exact same thing when they drew

17:36.133 --> 17:37.467
this grotesquely unfair

17:37.467 --> 17:38.867
district.

17:38.867 --> 17:40.233
Okay, this is bad.

17:40.233 --> 17:41.800
But, maybe it's just one of

17:41.800 --> 17:43.267
those things that comes with

17:43.300 --> 17:44.967
democracy, right?

17:44.967 --> 17:46.433
Actually, Donna, the only

17:46.433 --> 17:47.567
other country that has a system

17:47.567 --> 17:49.200
like this is France.

17:49.233 --> 17:50.533
No!

17:50.533 --> 17:52.300
We're not like France!

17:52.300 --> 17:53.033
Oui, oui.

17:53.033 --> 17:53.700
(gasping)

17:53.700 --> 17:54.867
So, before you vote tonight,

17:54.867 --> 17:56.433
remember, many of the results

17:56.433 --> 17:58.200
were decided before you even

17:58.200 --> 17:59.867
cast a ballot.

17:59.867 --> 18:01.500
Whoa.

18:01.533 --> 18:03.700
America really is broken.

18:03.700 --> 18:04.933
Oh, Donna, the polls close in

18:04.933 --> 18:05.900
five minutes.

18:05.900 --> 18:06.700
We've got to get you back so you

18:06.700 --> 18:07.533
can vote. (chuckling)

18:07.567 --> 18:08.567
Why?

18:08.567 --> 18:10.700
What's the point?

18:10.700 --> 18:11.567
I'm going home.

18:11.567 --> 18:12.300
Wait, no, Donna!

18:12.300 --> 18:13.600
If you wait one second, I was

18:13.600 --> 18:14.867
just-- wait.

18:14.867 --> 18:16.367
I was about to tell you why it's

18:16.367 --> 18:18.700
so important that you vote.

18:18.700 --> 18:21.600
(energy crackling)

18:21.600 --> 18:23.433
Man, that was my ride.

18:23.433 --> 18:25.433
(whistling)

18:27.300 --> 18:28.633
♪♪

18:28.633 --> 18:29.700
Hi, Ms. Reem.

18:29.700 --> 18:30.800
I know you're not gonna tell me,

18:30.800 --> 18:32.233
but I've got to know-- who did

18:32.233 --> 18:33.400
you vote for?

18:33.400 --> 18:35.367
No one.

18:35.367 --> 18:36.300
Voting is pointless.

18:36.300 --> 18:37.533
The system is broken.

18:37.533 --> 18:39.700
America's garbage.

18:39.700 --> 18:41.133
You got a cigarette?

18:41.133 --> 18:42.433
I'm-- I'm 12.

18:42.433 --> 18:46.933
So, you have one?

18:46.933 --> 18:50.233
(energy crackling)

18:53.433 --> 18:54.733
Oh, oh, man, this always

18:54.733 --> 18:57.100
happens.

18:57.100 --> 18:59.267
Ahh.

18:59.267 --> 19:00.200
You proved your point.

19:00.200 --> 19:01.067
I didn't vote.

19:01.067 --> 19:02.633
Oh, Donna, I've been trying

19:02.633 --> 19:04.467
to explain why it's so important

19:04.467 --> 19:05.533
that you vote.

19:05.533 --> 19:06.567
Well, you ain't doing a good

19:06.567 --> 19:07.567
job of it.

19:07.567 --> 19:08.400
(energy crackling)

19:08.400 --> 19:09.633
Oh, what now?

19:09.633 --> 19:10.567
Whew! (chuckling)

19:10.567 --> 19:11.233
Finally!

19:11.233 --> 19:12.967
It took me forever to find a

19:12.967 --> 19:14.800
working time-traveling voting

19:14.800 --> 19:15.633
booth.

19:15.633 --> 19:16.900
But, I wanted to come tell you,

19:16.900 --> 19:17.967
don't lose heart, Donna.

19:17.967 --> 19:19.233
The founding fathers said "All

19:19.233 --> 19:20.900
men are created equal," and they

19:20.900 --> 19:21.967
couldn't live up to it in their

19:21.967 --> 19:23.900
era, but they built a machine

19:23.900 --> 19:25.433
that allows us to get better

19:25.433 --> 19:26.300
every generation.

19:26.300 --> 19:27.133
Now, it's our turn.

19:27.133 --> 19:28.800
Look, American democracy

19:28.800 --> 19:30.633
isn't perfect, but it used to be

19:30.633 --> 19:32.200
a lot worse, and our system is

19:32.200 --> 19:33.767
actually more inclusive and

19:33.767 --> 19:35.900
democratic than it has ever

19:35.900 --> 19:36.800
been before.

19:36.800 --> 19:38.300
And that's because, we've used

19:38.300 --> 19:40.433
democracy to make democracy

19:40.433 --> 19:41.233
stronger.

19:41.233 --> 19:42.567
So, Donna, if you want things to

19:42.567 --> 19:44.633
get better, you have to vote.

19:44.633 --> 19:46.133
I guess, but changing the

19:46.133 --> 19:48.033
system seems really hard.

19:48.033 --> 19:49.633
Oh, it is, but here's one

19:49.633 --> 19:50.933
simple idea-- why don't we make

19:50.933 --> 19:53.300
election day a national holiday?

19:53.300 --> 19:54.600
It's way too difficult for busy

19:54.600 --> 19:56.100
Americans to get to the polls.

19:56.100 --> 19:57.033
Tell me about it.

19:57.033 --> 19:58.067
I had to take off work

19:58.067 --> 19:59.433
to come here.

19:59.433 --> 20:00.733
That way, more Americans

20:00.733 --> 20:02.533
could vote more easily, and we

20:02.533 --> 20:03.967
would have time to celebrate

20:03.967 --> 20:05.900
election day for what it is--

20:05.900 --> 20:07.300
the most patriotic day of

20:07.300 --> 20:07.967
the year.

20:07.967 --> 20:09.367
What an awesome idea, Adam.

20:09.367 --> 20:11.367
You know, that really is

20:11.367 --> 20:13.133
inspiring.

20:13.133 --> 20:13.967
I'll do it!

20:13.967 --> 20:16.133
I'll vote!

20:16.133 --> 20:18.300
(softly) Yeah.

20:18.300 --> 20:19.733
Oh, hey, Donna, um...

20:19.733 --> 20:21.367
I really liked traveling through

20:21.367 --> 20:22.133
time with you.

20:22.133 --> 20:23.867
Oh, me too.

20:23.867 --> 20:24.767

20:24.767 --> 20:27.233
tea, or chat, or just hang out,

20:27.233 --> 20:28.233
you know, let me know.

20:28.233 --> 20:29.067
Hang out?

20:29.067 --> 20:31.200
Like... as friends?

20:31.200 --> 20:32.733
Mr. Conover, I would love to

20:32.733 --> 20:33.633
be your friend.
