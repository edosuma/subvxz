00:00.353 --> 00:02.273
Previously on Andi Mack...

00:02.298 --> 00:04.142
I'm failing, and I have
a GPA to think about.

00:04.966 --> 00:06.935
There... is another option.

00:08.759 --> 00:10.427
Good. Strong arms!

00:10.460 --> 00:12.329
Five, six, seven and one.

00:12.363 --> 00:13.965
I've made a huge mistake.

00:13.997 --> 00:15.610
Andi, Libby.

00:15.845 --> 00:17.081
Libby, Andi.

00:18.468 --> 00:20.471
We didn't really break up.

00:20.505 --> 00:23.142
We just agreed we
were better as friends.

00:24.474 --> 00:26.011
You can't break up with him.

00:27.011 --> 00:29.648
But that's a whole other story!

00:29.681 --> 00:32.083
Look, he is a really great guy.

00:32.115 --> 00:34.275
Please, do not break up with
him because of what I said

00:36.063 --> 00:38.155
Will you? Will you? Will you...

00:38.188 --> 00:39.290
Will I what?!

00:39.324 --> 00:42.027
Will you... go to fall formal with me?

00:42.059 --> 00:43.358
No.

00:48.700 --> 00:50.537
You guys really thought I'd say yes?

00:50.723 --> 00:53.085
I never liked all that
Secret Society stuff.

00:53.253 --> 00:55.423
- And those robes.
- And the chanting?

00:55.617 --> 00:56.821
Points for creativity!

00:57.950 --> 01:00.186
But kind of a sick way
to ask someone to a dance.

01:00.621 --> 01:01.865
Not to mention:

01:01.932 --> 01:03.233
I don't like surprises...

01:03.265 --> 01:04.834
I don't like being put on the spot...

01:04.867 --> 01:08.071
and the last thing I ever
wanna be is predictable.

01:08.104 --> 01:09.339
I feel bad for the guy.

01:09.372 --> 01:10.741
His heart was in the right place.

01:10.774 --> 01:13.415
And you still really like him, right?

01:13.440 --> 01:14.524
Ehh...

01:14.549 --> 01:15.712
- Hold up!
- Excuse me?

01:15.745 --> 01:17.547
- You don't like him?
- Since when?

01:17.581 --> 01:18.910
Now I really feel bad for the guy.

01:18.934 --> 01:20.650
- What happened?
- I don't want to say.

01:20.684 --> 01:23.143
We are well past
the point of not saying.

01:24.607 --> 01:25.756
He made me shoes.

01:25.789 --> 01:27.558
What's that? Speak up.

01:27.590 --> 01:29.393
He made me shoes!

01:30.692 --> 01:32.127
He did?

01:32.160 --> 01:33.228
Like he made me shoes?

01:33.261 --> 01:34.463
That is so wrong.

01:34.496 --> 01:36.878
- It is?
- It's a signature move!

01:37.132 --> 01:40.135
Imagine if you'd worn
those shoes to the dance.

01:40.168 --> 01:42.504
And there were all these other
girls wearing his shoes?

01:42.537 --> 01:43.772
- Ughh!
- Blechh!

01:43.805 --> 01:46.307
So, you're breaking up
with him, obviously.

01:46.332 --> 01:48.978
Yeah. We're done. It's over.

01:49.010 --> 01:51.814
I haven't been answering his
texts, or taking his calls.

01:51.847 --> 01:53.282
Ghosting is unreliable.

01:53.316 --> 01:55.084
If you really want this
relationship to end,

01:55.117 --> 01:57.085
you need to tell him in person.

01:57.118 --> 01:58.987
Come on. He knows!

01:59.020 --> 02:00.290
I'm sure he knows.

02:02.657 --> 02:03.749
How can he not know?

02:05.628 --> 02:06.796
He's a guy.

03:13.800 --> 03:14.836
Ahem.

03:18.372 --> 03:19.640
What are you doing here?

03:19.673 --> 03:21.709
I reserved the studio for this hour.

03:21.968 --> 03:23.571
What are you doing here?

03:24.437 --> 03:25.825
Rehearsing.

03:26.471 --> 03:29.088
What? Being electrocuted?

03:29.130 --> 03:32.109
I'm supposed to come up with an original
dance for my choreography final

03:32.332 --> 03:34.200
and perform it in front of the class.

03:34.225 --> 03:35.260
Well...

03:35.521 --> 03:38.025
you have the "original" part down.

03:38.057 --> 03:39.425
I don't know why I'm even trying.

03:39.459 --> 03:41.704
I can't come up with any count
of eight that doesn't start

03:41.728 --> 03:43.639
with jazz hands and end
with me twisting my ankle.

03:43.663 --> 03:46.226
- You need a tutor.
- I know, but it's too late.

03:46.251 --> 03:49.354
Nobody's gonna want to take
this on at the last minute.

03:49.379 --> 03:50.471
What about me?

03:50.503 --> 03:53.826
Yeesh, fine. "How are you, Amber?"

03:54.081 --> 03:56.984
Sorry for talking about my
problems for, like, five minutes.

03:57.009 --> 04:00.114
No, I mean I'll be your tutor.

04:00.139 --> 04:01.974
Really? You'd do that?

04:01.999 --> 04:03.868
Why not? I mean...

04:03.893 --> 04:06.160
I still owe you for all
those counseling sessions.

04:06.185 --> 04:08.655
That really wasn't
professional-level counseling.

04:08.680 --> 04:11.516
Well, it looks like this won't really
be professional-level dancing.

04:13.926 --> 04:15.019
True dat.

04:17.435 --> 04:18.512
Okay...

04:18.894 --> 04:20.567
I have a surprise for you guys.

04:20.601 --> 04:21.668
Ooh!

04:21.702 --> 04:23.871
Wait. This is it, isn't it?

04:23.904 --> 04:25.787
The surprise puppy!

04:25.812 --> 04:26.880
Ohh, the dream.

04:26.905 --> 04:28.206
Am I ready? I'm not ready.

04:28.231 --> 04:29.967
I want the cuddles,
but not the clean-up.

04:30.176 --> 04:32.126
- It's not a puppy.
- Oh...

04:32.151 --> 04:33.628
Well, now I do feel ready.

04:35.577 --> 04:36.749
Ta-da!

04:36.782 --> 04:38.837
- Wow...
- I like it!

04:39.453 --> 04:40.554
Who are the Quinns?

04:40.587 --> 04:42.056
We're the Quinns!

04:42.089 --> 04:43.532
Or, at least, we will be pretty soon.

04:43.556 --> 04:46.227
So I'll be Andi Quinn.

04:47.903 --> 04:49.172
Andi Quinn...

04:49.205 --> 04:50.940
I like the sound of that!

04:50.972 --> 04:52.275
Well, it's your choice.

04:52.307 --> 04:53.843
If you want your name to be that,

04:53.876 --> 04:55.178
then that's what it will be.

04:55.210 --> 04:57.412
Don't we all want the same last name?

04:57.446 --> 04:58.547
I do.

04:58.581 --> 05:00.291
Well, you're not the one losing yours.

05:02.341 --> 05:04.410
I mean, does it really matter?

05:04.444 --> 05:07.247
A lot of families don't
have the same last name.

05:07.280 --> 05:09.826
Like us! We don't have the
same last name right now.

05:09.850 --> 05:11.218
It's just...

05:13.952 --> 05:15.655
We're making it official.

05:15.689 --> 05:17.258
I thought, when we do,

05:17.290 --> 05:19.025
that we'd be The Quinns.

05:19.291 --> 05:21.028
Is that important to you?

05:21.368 --> 05:22.570
Well...

05:25.198 --> 05:26.267
yeah.

05:27.133 --> 05:29.703
I just... I can't believe
I didn't know this.

05:29.735 --> 05:31.838
Then it's our family name.

05:31.872 --> 05:35.342
And it's a sign... hence, the sign...

05:35.374 --> 05:37.944
that we're a unit, we're a tribe.

05:37.977 --> 05:41.180
Together, the way that we
were always meant to be.

05:41.213 --> 05:44.517
And I think it's important we
get to choose our own identity.

05:44.550 --> 05:46.719
Including our name.

05:46.752 --> 05:48.221
I like being a Mack.

05:48.254 --> 05:50.290
It rhymes with a lot of stuff.

05:50.324 --> 05:52.191
It's stitched on my bowling shirt.

05:52.225 --> 05:54.094
It's who I am.

05:54.126 --> 05:55.355
How do you feel?

05:56.329 --> 05:57.531
Well...

05:57.556 --> 05:59.066
what if we did a mash-up?

05:59.098 --> 06:02.728
I mean, combine Quinn and Mack,

06:03.069 --> 06:05.305
and come up with our
very own custom-made name!

06:06.686 --> 06:08.489
You mean like the Quacks?

06:11.171 --> 06:12.651
Yeah, that's not gonna work.

06:14.892 --> 06:17.284
Okay! Let's warm up.

06:17.728 --> 06:19.189
Touch your toes.

06:20.086 --> 06:21.087
Yeah,

06:21.121 --> 06:22.323
I can't do that.

06:22.355 --> 06:23.756
The closest I can get...

06:23.790 --> 06:25.137
is my knees.

06:26.092 --> 06:27.128
Seriously?

06:27.548 --> 06:29.562
My grandpa can touch his toes.

06:29.595 --> 06:33.132
Your grandpa is from a
generation that played outside.

06:33.165 --> 06:37.504
This body was built watching internet
videos on a memory foam mattress.

06:37.537 --> 06:40.607
Okay, put your arms in first position.

06:41.048 --> 06:42.217
You mean "beach ball."

06:42.250 --> 06:44.018
Excuse me?

06:44.052 --> 06:45.888
That's how I memorized
the arm positions.

06:45.920 --> 06:47.120
"Fat man,"

06:47.145 --> 06:48.167
"beach ball,"

06:48.192 --> 06:49.193
"full moon,"

06:49.218 --> 06:50.367
"big fish."

06:50.392 --> 06:51.594
You're kidding.

06:51.793 --> 06:54.529
Right now you're doing
"disappointed teacher."

06:56.358 --> 06:57.397
Okay...

06:57.452 --> 06:59.555
five, six, seven, eight.

06:59.580 --> 07:01.950
Step-touch, right step,

07:01.975 --> 07:04.378
pivot-turn, and hip hip.

07:04.740 --> 07:05.866
No way.

07:05.891 --> 07:06.927
That's too hard!

07:06.952 --> 07:08.239
Oh, really?

07:08.540 --> 07:09.745
Then how 'bout this?

07:21.156 --> 07:22.725
Okay, show me the other one again.

07:22.757 --> 07:24.025
Okay.

07:32.511 --> 07:34.013
Wow.

07:34.047 --> 07:36.482
We are going to lose so bad.

07:36.516 --> 07:37.850
We know.

07:37.883 --> 07:39.485
You've been saying it all week.

07:39.518 --> 07:41.855
But I hoped we'd just lose kinda bad.

07:41.888 --> 07:44.258
This is going to be humiliating.

07:44.290 --> 07:46.526
Aren't you supposed to say something

07:46.559 --> 07:48.629
captain-y, like, um...

07:48.662 --> 07:50.631
"All we can do is our best!"

07:50.663 --> 07:52.999
Yeah, probably.

07:53.033 --> 07:54.300
Hello,

07:54.333 --> 07:55.535
sorry I'm late!

07:55.569 --> 07:57.436
I brought orange slices.

07:57.470 --> 07:58.472
Hey, Coach.

07:58.504 --> 08:00.473
Oh, please, call me Deborah.

08:00.506 --> 08:01.874
"Coach" is so formal,

08:01.908 --> 08:04.110
and anyhow, I don't know
a thing about basketball.

08:04.143 --> 08:06.556
Although, I was quite the superstar
of my school's badminton team,

08:06.580 --> 08:07.681
the Shuttle-chicks.

08:07.713 --> 08:10.048
Thanks for agreeing to do this.

08:10.073 --> 08:12.627
Oh. Let's be honest,
I was your last hope.

08:12.652 --> 08:15.297
But I want to support the
first girls' basketball team

08:15.322 --> 08:17.179
ever in the history of the school!

08:17.523 --> 08:18.691
It's an important milestone!

08:18.725 --> 08:21.494
Which will forever
be recorded as a bloodbath.

08:21.528 --> 08:22.696
Well...

08:22.729 --> 08:25.332
If there's anything
I can do to help, just

08:25.364 --> 08:26.966
let me know.

08:26.999 --> 08:31.071
And please keep in mind:
I am a guidance counselor first,

08:31.104 --> 08:34.207
and a basketball coach not at all.

08:35.404 --> 08:36.751
Well, look on the bright side.

08:36.775 --> 08:37.910
I would love to.

08:37.943 --> 08:40.063
- What is it?
- Yeah...

08:40.706 --> 08:42.557
probably won't have enough
girls to play at all.

08:42.581 --> 08:43.816
What do you mean?

08:43.850 --> 08:44.984
Isn't anyone else coming?

08:45.018 --> 08:46.420
I don't think so.

08:46.452 --> 08:48.487
- Why not?
- Well, maybe

08:48.521 --> 08:50.700
because you told them we were
going to lose no matter what?

08:50.724 --> 08:52.000
And that it was going
to be really embarrassing?

08:52.024 --> 08:54.827
Yeah, okay, that would
have been embarrassing.

08:54.860 --> 08:57.597
But now we're going to have to
forfeit, which is way worse!

08:59.083 --> 09:00.618
I can fix this.

09:00.679 --> 09:02.051
I'll just call them.

09:04.485 --> 09:05.938
I think something's up.

09:05.971 --> 09:07.408
Buffy doesn't look too happy.

09:14.815 --> 09:18.819
Are you still thinking
about breaking up with Jonah?

09:21.085 --> 09:22.654
Why?

09:26.390 --> 09:28.227
Are you guys talking about me?

09:29.273 --> 09:30.803
No!

09:32.465 --> 09:34.600
I'm going to get a drink.

09:34.633 --> 09:36.202
Do you want anything?

09:36.235 --> 09:38.605
Do you want something to drink?

09:45.010 --> 09:47.747
I feel bad...

09:47.781 --> 09:49.583
talking behind his back.

09:49.615 --> 09:53.787
We're not talking behind his back.

09:53.820 --> 09:57.724
We are talking in front of his face.

09:57.757 --> 09:59.493
I know...

10:02.062 --> 10:03.330
I can't believe it!

10:03.363 --> 10:04.431
No one's coming!

10:04.464 --> 10:05.632
Not "no one."

10:05.664 --> 10:07.066
Four of us showed up.

10:07.100 --> 10:10.003
Four would be great
if we were bobsledding,

10:10.036 --> 10:12.339
but we need five to play basketball!

10:15.009 --> 10:17.476
We only need one more player.

10:17.815 --> 10:19.252
Just one...

10:29.169 --> 10:30.424
Found her.

10:36.562 --> 10:37.949
Come on. You're playing.

10:37.974 --> 10:40.433
What? I don't know
how to play basketball!

10:40.466 --> 10:42.335
Then you'll fit right in.

10:42.369 --> 10:44.104
- What's going on there?
- No idea.

10:50.176 --> 10:51.679
Nice to see you.

10:53.046 --> 10:54.614
You've gotten really good at that.

10:54.647 --> 10:56.616
I really like talking with my hands.

10:56.648 --> 10:58.618
Turns out, this hand will
give it to you straight.

10:58.651 --> 11:01.034
But this hand is a silver-tongued devil.

11:04.224 --> 11:06.026
Will you ask Libby if she's mad at me?

11:06.370 --> 11:07.538
Sure.

11:08.728 --> 11:10.698
Are you mad at Jonah?

11:14.245 --> 11:15.369
What did she say?

11:15.402 --> 11:17.290
You should really learn sign language.

11:17.315 --> 11:18.979
I know, I know, but what did she say?

11:19.004 --> 11:20.639
That is what she said.

11:20.672 --> 11:25.157
You. Should. Learn. Sign language.

11:25.776 --> 11:27.157
Oh...

11:28.047 --> 11:29.311
I'm sorry...

11:29.336 --> 11:31.585
Can you tell her "I'm sorry"?

11:31.618 --> 11:33.186
He's sorry.

11:39.758 --> 11:41.327
I don't get it.

11:41.360 --> 11:43.095
I thought texting was working fine.

11:43.129 --> 11:45.031
It was "fine."

11:45.063 --> 11:48.534
Fine to start with, but you two
have been going out for awhile.

11:48.567 --> 11:51.337
She's probably wondering
why you haven't leveled up,

11:51.370 --> 11:52.938
so that you can talk face to face.

11:52.971 --> 11:54.441
So, why didn't she just say that?

11:54.474 --> 11:56.443
She has been saying that.

11:56.475 --> 11:58.715
You just haven't bothered to
learn enough sign to get it.

11:59.069 --> 12:00.439
I know.

12:01.029 --> 12:02.182
You're right.

12:02.215 --> 12:03.716
She's right.

12:03.749 --> 12:05.292
Why haven't you tried to learn?

12:05.532 --> 12:06.686
I don't know.

12:06.719 --> 12:07.720
Yes, you do.

12:07.754 --> 12:10.190
You just haven't asked
yourself the question.

12:10.223 --> 12:12.758
Professionally, my stepmom
calls it "avoidance."

12:12.792 --> 12:15.362
At home, she calls it "that
thing Dad does when he golfs."

12:15.394 --> 12:17.630
I guess I'm afraid I'll be bad at it.

12:17.663 --> 12:20.366
What if I say something
wrong and look stupid?

12:20.399 --> 12:22.701
You won't look stupid.

12:22.734 --> 12:24.270
And even if you do...

12:24.303 --> 12:26.539
you'll look like you care enough to try.

12:31.478 --> 12:33.213
- Hey.
- Hey.

12:33.245 --> 12:36.405
So, I thought we should
talk after yesterday's...

12:36.749 --> 12:37.817
"Quinn-cident."

12:38.307 --> 12:39.785
"Quinn-cident."

12:39.818 --> 12:41.053
- Nice.
- Yeah, yeah.

12:41.086 --> 12:42.621
But seriously.

12:42.654 --> 12:44.667
It made me think there might be
other things we should talk about

12:44.691 --> 12:46.134
before the wedding, just to make sure

12:46.158 --> 12:48.061
we're both in agreement
on the important stuff.

12:48.094 --> 12:49.763
I'm down.

12:49.796 --> 12:51.097
What are these for?

12:51.129 --> 12:53.332
Well, I thought we could
take turns asking questions,

12:53.365 --> 12:55.000
and we both write down an answer.

12:55.033 --> 12:56.177
We won't read them until we're done,

12:56.201 --> 12:57.412
that way we'll know they're honest.

12:57.436 --> 12:59.272
Cool. I'm ready.

12:59.305 --> 13:00.739
Okay.

13:00.773 --> 13:02.341
You ask first.

13:02.817 --> 13:04.009
Anything?

13:04.042 --> 13:05.445
Anything.

13:05.478 --> 13:06.912
Calzones...

13:06.946 --> 13:08.081
a genius invention,

13:08.114 --> 13:09.576
or just a good way to burn your mouth?

13:09.600 --> 13:11.603
Bowie! Be serious!

13:11.884 --> 13:13.452
You know I hate calzones.

13:13.485 --> 13:15.163
The cheese is always
the temperature of the sun.

13:15.187 --> 13:16.856
Okay, okay, um...

13:18.376 --> 13:20.368
Do you want to live
in Shadyside forever?

13:20.671 --> 13:22.295
Ohh.

13:22.327 --> 13:23.829
- Good one.
- Thanks.

13:27.694 --> 13:28.702
Hey!

13:28.734 --> 13:30.769
- No peeking!
- Sorry.

13:30.802 --> 13:32.505
Okay, fine. My turn.

13:33.042 --> 13:34.975
Would you ever want to have...

13:35.008 --> 13:36.376
more kids?

13:36.408 --> 13:37.543
Whoa!

13:37.576 --> 13:38.845
Coming in hot!

13:38.878 --> 13:40.446
Like a calzone, baby.

13:49.022 --> 13:51.525
This is just a yes
or no question, right?

13:58.331 --> 14:00.633
Remind me again why I'm doing this?

14:00.667 --> 14:02.035
Because you're a good friend.

14:02.067 --> 14:04.297
I know. Question is, are you?

14:12.210 --> 14:13.580
Ugh!

15:22.315 --> 15:24.947
All right, you called it.
This is a bloodbath.

15:27.521 --> 15:28.589
Time out!

15:35.628 --> 15:36.796
I only have one thing to say.

15:36.829 --> 15:38.164
Look, Buffy, we're really try...

15:38.196 --> 15:39.465
Thank you.

15:39.499 --> 15:40.933
For what?

15:41.372 --> 15:43.376
For showing up.

15:44.269 --> 15:46.288
I haven't been a great captain.

15:47.206 --> 15:50.877
Scratch that...
I've been a terrible captain.

15:52.544 --> 15:57.950
I was so afraid to lose, and I thought
losing was the worst thing ever.

15:57.984 --> 16:00.686
But it's not.

16:00.720 --> 16:02.689
Today, we almost didn't get to play.

16:06.058 --> 16:07.126
Look at that!

16:07.159 --> 16:08.627
Knew it was bad.

16:08.661 --> 16:10.430
Didn't know it was that bad.

16:10.462 --> 16:11.764
The score doesn't matter!

16:11.797 --> 16:15.201
What matters is that
we are on that scoreboard!

16:15.234 --> 16:19.939
We are here, and we are on the court,
and we are playing basketball!

16:19.971 --> 16:21.975
Because you showed up.

16:22.008 --> 16:23.942
That's what matters.

16:23.975 --> 16:25.511
That's all that matters!

16:27.846 --> 16:31.017
Now... let's go out there and lose!

16:33.052 --> 16:34.653
Buffy! Buffy! Buffy...

16:37.889 --> 16:39.191
That was my first huddle!

16:39.225 --> 16:41.528
I didn't know they were so fun!

16:45.565 --> 16:47.633
Shoot! You got this!

16:50.168 --> 16:51.236
Yes!

17:11.982 --> 17:13.026
Whoa!

17:13.059 --> 17:14.059
Ow...

17:15.227 --> 17:16.396
All right, go get 'em!

17:36.948 --> 17:39.384
I can't believe Andi scored!

17:39.417 --> 17:42.009
Wait, why is the other
team cheering for her, too?

17:42.214 --> 17:43.849
Because it was their basket.

17:43.990 --> 17:45.191
Oh...

17:45.224 --> 17:46.426
Still!

17:46.458 --> 17:47.998
Wooo!

18:16.600 --> 18:18.957
- Can I be honest?
- Yes.

18:18.991 --> 18:20.160
You're quite good at it.

18:21.627 --> 18:23.730
I'm really surprised.

18:23.763 --> 18:25.777
- Same here.
- We are...

18:27.099 --> 18:28.600
shockingly compatible.

18:29.902 --> 18:31.180
I mean, there's still some
stuff we need to work on.

18:31.204 --> 18:32.948
But most of the big things,
we got those right.

18:32.972 --> 18:34.945
It's so nice we both
want the same things.

18:34.970 --> 18:36.020
I know.

18:36.045 --> 18:37.677
But how are we going to get them? Nope!

18:37.709 --> 18:38.844
Don't answer.

18:38.878 --> 18:40.112
That's for another day,

18:40.146 --> 18:41.446
for another pad of paper.

18:41.479 --> 18:44.516
No more rounds of the
Not-Yet-Newlyweds game.

18:44.550 --> 18:45.790
I have one more question.

18:45.815 --> 18:48.521
What did I just say-ay-ay-ay!

18:48.817 --> 18:51.523
- Hey! Who wants pizza?
- We both do!

18:52.064 --> 18:53.492
That is correct!

19:08.678 --> 19:10.916
Oh, no, no...

19:17.082 --> 19:21.787
Will... you... teach... me...

19:21.821 --> 19:23.590
sign language?

19:26.591 --> 19:27.957
Yes!

19:28.144 --> 19:31.598
I... like... you.

19:33.398 --> 19:37.937
I... like... you...

19:39.437 --> 19:40.616
too?

19:42.375 --> 19:43.743
...too.

19:44.735 --> 19:46.012
Too.

19:54.086 --> 19:56.222
- You got this.
- Definitely.

19:56.254 --> 19:58.824
If "this" is a big case
of the noodle knees.

19:58.858 --> 20:01.261
- Just remember what I told you.
- Right.

20:01.293 --> 20:03.662
You worked too hard for me to blow this.

20:03.696 --> 20:05.098
Exactly.

20:05.573 --> 20:07.786
Also, you'll be great.

20:14.206 --> 20:16.141

What did we learn about assuming things?

21:38.690 --> 21:41.460
Okay, I, uh, hope

21:41.494 --> 21:42.861
that you'll like it.

21:44.030 --> 21:46.566
Oh, yay, a new sign.

21:49.044 --> 21:50.169
"The Macks"?

21:50.352 --> 21:51.454
What'd you think?

21:51.479 --> 21:53.151
I like it...

21:53.406 --> 21:55.707
but now, your name won't be on the door.

21:55.741 --> 21:57.477
Yes, it will.

21:57.510 --> 21:59.104
Because I'm gonna change it.

21:59.444 --> 22:00.879
You're looking

22:00.913 --> 22:04.317
at the future Mr. Bowie Mack.

22:06.104 --> 22:07.857
- Really?
- Yeah!

22:08.587 --> 22:10.289
Come on, we're a tribe.

22:10.321 --> 22:11.357
Yeah we are!

22:12.344 --> 22:13.993
What do you think?

22:14.544 --> 22:17.209
You're really sure you
want to be one of us?

22:19.031 --> 22:21.200
Only if it's forever.

22:40.603 --> 22:42.658
Hey, it's me.

22:43.788 --> 22:45.858
Um, but look, so,

22:45.890 --> 22:48.326
the last time I saw you...

22:48.359 --> 22:50.696
I don't think I handled
things very well.

22:52.465 --> 22:53.533
Listen,

22:53.558 --> 22:55.841
this is really hard for
me to say over the phone.

22:56.936 --> 22:58.648
Can we please meet up?

23:01.474 --> 23:04.543
Sure, we can do that.

23:07.879 --> 23:09.415
Next on Andi Mack...

23:09.447 --> 23:11.950
Shiva's about friends and
family being together to...

23:11.984 --> 23:14.186
comfort one another and share stories.

23:14.219 --> 23:17.389
That sounds like a really nice thing
to do when you've just lost someone.

23:20.158 --> 23:21.359
Sorry.

23:21.392 --> 23:23.196
- Who was that?
- Nobody!

23:23.221 --> 23:24.296
I'll be right back.

23:24.330 --> 23:26.465
I read that people
bring food to a Shiva.

23:26.498 --> 23:29.034
- Bowie made a kugel.
- It's a shanda.

23:29.068 --> 23:30.470
It's delicious!

23:30.503 --> 23:32.970
- No! A shanda is a disgrace.
- Wow...

23:35.340 --> 23:36.375
Hey, you're okay.

23:36.408 --> 23:38.711
You know what this is,
it's a panic attack.

23:38.744 --> 23:41.359
It will end... yes, it will!
