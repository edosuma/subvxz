03:19.741 --> 03:20.788
Mom?

03:32.087 --> 03:33.430
Mom?

03:34.339 --> 03:36.341
Oh, my God!

03:51.189 --> 03:52.990
Push it the other way.
Come on, guys, push it!

03:53.984 --> 03:57.158
Move when you got the ball!
Nobody's moving.

03:57.696 --> 03:59.949
Know where your teammates are!

04:01.199 --> 04:03.293
All right, hold up. Hold it up.

04:03.368 --> 04:07.418
New ball. We are going
to play with this ball.

04:08.540 --> 04:10.042
- Invisiball.

04:10.125 --> 04:11.468
Catch.

04:13.295 --> 04:15.673
It's pretty funny. You
think it's pretty silly.

04:15.839 --> 04:18.843
This is the place it's okay to feel silly,
the practice floor.

04:19.009 --> 04:21.728
Not with people
in the stands watching you play.

04:21.887 --> 04:23.685
All right, you guys. Run a couple plays.

04:23.847 --> 04:25.349
Let's set it up. Three game.

04:25.515 --> 04:27.563
- Where's the ball?
- It's in my mind, Coach.

04:27.726 --> 04:29.287
- It is in your mind.
- It's in my mind.

04:29.394 --> 04:30.611
One brain! One brain!

04:30.687 --> 04:32.860
There you go! That's the way to move it!

04:33.023 --> 04:34.366
You guys play better with the invisiball

04:34.441 --> 04:35.943
than you do the real ball. I like it.

04:44.576 --> 04:46.169
- Hey, kiddo.
- Hey, how are you?

04:46.328 --> 04:47.671
Good, how are you?

04:47.829 --> 04:50.833
You spaz. Yeah, I was there all alone.

04:50.999 --> 04:52.376
- Hi.
- Hey.

04:54.294 --> 04:55.637
You're late.

04:56.671 --> 04:58.014
Practice ran long.

04:59.925 --> 05:02.519
Oh, uh, Clyde, shoes, please?

05:10.101 --> 05:12.399
What is this?

05:12.562 --> 05:14.564
I needed the extra space for the business.

05:14.648 --> 05:15.928
We're officially up and running.

05:17.234 --> 05:18.235
Hmm.

05:19.611 --> 05:20.954
Yeah.

05:21.613 --> 05:25.538
The jewelry design.
I told you I was getting back into it.

05:29.204 --> 05:30.884
Stephanie, I had a bunch of stuff in here.

05:30.956 --> 05:33.004
Oh, yeah, I boxed up all your stuff.

05:33.083 --> 05:34.084
I put your name on it.

05:34.251 --> 05:36.331
Everything's in the closet
right here in the hallway.

05:36.628 --> 05:38.130
Don't you think maybe
I should have packed up

05:38.213 --> 05:40.215
my stuff from my office?

05:40.382 --> 05:42.635
Clyde, it's not your office any more.

05:56.231 --> 05:58.404
Hey, kiddo. You ready to go?

06:01.236 --> 06:02.738
Which one do you think is a better slogan?

06:02.904 --> 06:05.248
"Stop The Killing, Eat Vegetables,"

06:05.407 --> 06:08.081
or "When You Eat Animals,
You Become One"?

06:10.078 --> 06:13.503
First of all, that is awesome,
but I'm going to say, as far as slogans go,

06:13.582 --> 06:15.425
"Stop The Killing," it's super catchy.

06:15.584 --> 06:17.837
- Gets the message across?
- Loud and clear.

06:18.003 --> 06:20.756
Miss Shandy said that if we get
200 signatures on this petition,

06:20.839 --> 06:22.716
she'll take it to the principal

06:22.799 --> 06:24.551
and they'll consider doing
meat-free Mondays

06:24.634 --> 06:25.635
in the cafeteria.

06:25.719 --> 06:28.017
Wow, that's going to make you so popular.

06:28.763 --> 06:30.561
Dad, you need to understand that

06:30.640 --> 06:31.937
we're all one big family on this planet,

06:32.100 --> 06:33.477
no matter what species,

06:33.643 --> 06:35.611
and we don't eat our own family, do we?

06:35.770 --> 06:37.238
No, we certainly do not.

06:39.941 --> 06:41.443
- Hi, Clyde.
- Hey.

06:42.027 --> 06:45.122
Careful, Brett.
You are entering a shoe-free zone.

06:45.280 --> 06:47.703
I know.
I got that sign for Stephanie.

06:48.033 --> 06:50.752
You wouldn't believe the bacteria
that gets dragged into a house.

06:50.827 --> 06:52.170
Oh, I'm sure I wouldn't.

06:52.329 --> 06:54.002
- Hey!
- Hi.

06:54.289 --> 06:55.916
So what are you guys up to tonight?

06:56.791 --> 06:58.293
- We're going to a concert.
- Nice.

06:58.627 --> 07:00.470
Season tickets. Wagner.

07:00.629 --> 07:04.805
Wagner? Stephanie loves
Wagner, don't you, dear?

07:05.467 --> 07:07.640
I'll have 'em back Sunday after lunch.

07:07.802 --> 07:09.145
Okay.

07:09.471 --> 07:11.690
Um, Em's still doing the vegetarian thing,

07:11.765 --> 07:14.814
so keep an eye on her,
and her allergies, please.

07:14.976 --> 07:16.819
Last time she came back with hives.

07:17.312 --> 07:20.065
And just healthy food, okay?
Stuff that grows on trees?

07:20.231 --> 07:22.199
No pizza, please. I mean it.

07:22.359 --> 07:23.702
You done?

07:24.152 --> 07:25.495
Yes.

07:25.654 --> 07:26.997
- Stephanie...
- Yes?

07:27.530 --> 07:28.873
I think I got this.

07:29.032 --> 07:30.375
- Okay.
- Okay.

07:33.662 --> 07:36.541
- Bye you guys! I love you!
- Bye!

07:39.834 --> 07:41.632
Brett says I have an overbite.

07:41.711 --> 07:44.089
Oh, give me a break. Your teeth are fine.

07:44.255 --> 07:47.680
Brett's job is to tell
people that they have bad teeth.

07:47.842 --> 07:49.185
That's how he makes his money.

07:49.678 --> 07:51.772
No, he said he'd fix my teeth for free.

07:51.930 --> 07:53.603
Uh, Dad?

07:54.599 --> 07:55.942
Yeah?

07:56.101 --> 07:57.944
You passed your apartment.

07:58.103 --> 08:00.026
Oh, I did, didn't I?

08:00.480 --> 08:01.606
Ta-dah!

08:01.690 --> 08:03.033
What is it?

08:03.191 --> 08:05.319
What is it? This is our new house.

08:05.485 --> 08:06.737
It's in the middle of nowhere.

08:06.820 --> 08:07.821
Isn't it awesome?

08:07.988 --> 08:10.036
And critters come over
from those woods over there.

08:10.198 --> 08:12.246
Yesterday, two raccoons on our porch.

08:12.409 --> 08:13.410
Really?

08:14.619 --> 08:16.041
Come on, Mopey McGee.

08:17.539 --> 08:21.464
Wow, this is pretty cool.

08:21.626 --> 08:24.379
Right? Bedrooms are upstairs.

08:33.138 --> 08:35.140
I call the room facing the woods!

08:35.890 --> 08:37.312
You got it. That's your room.

08:37.475 --> 08:39.477
Dad, there's a doggie door!

08:41.395 --> 08:43.023
Let's get a dog from the shelter, Dad.

08:43.106 --> 08:44.107
Please, let's get a dog.

08:44.274 --> 08:46.902
Please, pretty please, please.

08:47.068 --> 08:48.189
You've got to be kidding me.

08:48.194 --> 08:49.320
This does not work on me any more.

08:49.487 --> 08:52.206
Daddy, yes, it does.
Please, please, please, please.

08:55.785 --> 08:56.786
Cheers.

08:57.412 --> 08:58.664
- Cheers.
- Cheers, kiddo.

09:00.123 --> 09:03.673
You know, I think
Mom would really like this house.

09:03.835 --> 09:06.088
We should invite her for breakfast.

09:06.254 --> 09:08.006
Em, Mom and Dad

09:08.089 --> 09:10.012
are officially divorced
as of three months ago.

09:10.175 --> 09:12.223
Mom's not coming over for pancakes.

09:12.385 --> 09:14.586
- Hannah, that's enough.
- But it's getting old.

09:14.679 --> 09:17.440
Em's always talking about how you guys
are going to get back together.

09:19.267 --> 09:22.862
Em, your mom and I, we just sort of, uh...

09:23.688 --> 09:25.611
I don't know. We kind of
forgot how to get along.

09:26.941 --> 09:29.285
And you're both moving
on with your lives.

09:30.028 --> 09:32.406
I know. That's what Mom
always says.

09:34.282 --> 09:35.625
Your mom says that?

09:38.620 --> 09:40.588
Okay, well, then, there you have it.

09:40.663 --> 09:42.381
You know, it's for the best.

09:43.208 --> 09:46.758
Okay? So let's have our dinner.

09:47.629 --> 09:48.972
I'm not hungry any more.

09:51.091 --> 09:52.434
All right, clear your plate.

10:01.309 --> 10:02.652
Hannah...

10:03.186 --> 10:04.278
You can't say stuff like that.

10:04.354 --> 10:05.634
It's going to upset your sister.

10:07.315 --> 10:10.819
For real? You're going to
blame this on me?

10:12.320 --> 10:13.663
Nice, Dad.

10:18.451 --> 10:21.921
"Will you walk a little faster,"
said the whiting to the snail.

10:22.413 --> 10:24.757
"There's a porpoise close behind us,"

10:24.833 --> 10:26.835
"and he's treading on my tail."

10:27.001 --> 10:28.378
How was your day today?

10:29.546 --> 10:30.889
It was all right. How was yours?

10:31.047 --> 10:32.845
Dinner was a failure.

10:33.007 --> 10:36.056
Well, just make sure that
Mom doesn't find out about dinner,

10:36.219 --> 10:39.223
because she'll be mad
that pizza doesn't grow on trees.

10:39.389 --> 10:42.233
I'll give you $5 if you
don't tell your mother.

10:42.392 --> 10:44.394
Make it 35 and we have a deal.

10:49.399 --> 10:50.821
Go to sleep.

10:51.693 --> 10:53.070
Leave the door open.

10:53.236 --> 10:55.238
What's the matter? Are you scared?

10:55.405 --> 10:59.205
No. Just... I want it open, okay?

11:10.420 --> 11:12.422
Dad, you need dishes.

11:12.589 --> 11:14.262
<i>You have one unheard message.</i>

11:14.424 --> 11:15.767
Oh, okay.

11:15.925 --> 11:18.599
<i>Hey, Clyde, it's Trevor down at NC.</i>

11:18.928 --> 11:21.129
<i>Hey, give me a ring.
I wanted to run something past you.</i>

11:21.222 --> 11:22.565
<i>Hope you're good, pal.</i>

11:22.724 --> 11:24.442
Dad, look! Look, I'm a lady.

11:49.751 --> 11:51.128
Cool.

12:07.602 --> 12:08.854
Daddy, can I get this?

12:08.937 --> 12:10.280
That is a lovely hat.

12:11.064 --> 12:12.065
Whatever you want, kiddo.

12:12.232 --> 12:15.327
So we found a couple of things.
What's the damage?

12:17.278 --> 12:20.077
- How about 55?
- 55.

12:23.117 --> 12:25.836
My daughters have cleaned me out.
I have $48.

12:25.995 --> 12:27.167
We're happy to put something back.

12:27.247 --> 12:28.248
Oh, no. No, no. That's all right.

12:28.331 --> 12:29.674
- You sure?
- Yeah.

12:30.124 --> 12:31.467
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

12:33.503 --> 12:34.720
So you're gettin'
rid of a lot of stuff.

12:34.796 --> 12:36.173
You guys, uh, moving or something?

12:36.339 --> 12:38.933
No. Just a
couple of bills came up.

12:39.175 --> 12:40.176
Oh.

13:14.252 --> 13:17.222
No! No!

13:32.770 --> 13:37.276
Look at these carvings. They're so pretty.

13:39.444 --> 13:41.572
These directions are ridiculous.

13:41.738 --> 13:43.018
Hey, Em, would you do me a favor

13:43.031 --> 13:45.409
and hand me the small screwdriver, please?

13:46.617 --> 13:49.621
But, Daddy, you said
you'd get this open for me.

13:51.456 --> 13:54.084
Well, that's weird. There aren't any seams.

13:55.251 --> 13:56.594
What does that mean?

13:56.753 --> 13:59.347
Well, I think that means
that whoever made this

13:59.422 --> 14:01.015
didn't want anybody to open it,

14:01.090 --> 14:04.435
or at least they didn't want
anybody to open it easily.

14:06.262 --> 14:09.607
You hear that? There's something in there.

14:10.767 --> 14:14.317
So somebody had to open it,
once upon a time.

14:14.937 --> 14:17.360
- That is absolutely correct.

14:19.484 --> 14:21.844
- Daddy, no. Daddy, please.
- Sweetie, I've gotta take this.

14:21.903 --> 14:23.905
Trevor, hey.
Sorry, I keep missing your calls.

14:23.988 --> 14:24.989
Daddy.

14:25.156 --> 14:26.783
<i>- How's my old friend doing?</i>
- Good, good, uh...

14:26.866 --> 14:27.947
- Daddy...

14:28.076 --> 14:30.170
<i>You're running a good program up there.</i>

14:30.328 --> 14:32.251
<i>You've had two back-to-back
conference titles.</i>

14:32.413 --> 14:34.165
You calling just to chat?

14:34.332 --> 14:35.834
<i>The folks on our
athletic board are taking note.</i>

14:36.000 --> 14:38.719
<i>Thought it was time
you come down to North Carolina,</i>

14:38.795 --> 14:40.968
<i>have a discussion about your future.</i>

14:41.130 --> 14:42.632
What are we talking about here?

14:42.799 --> 14:45.769
<i>We're talking about you moving
up to Division One, Clyde.</i>

14:45.927 --> 14:47.600
Does Coach Hill know you're doing this?

14:47.678 --> 14:49.225
<i>He's retiring end of the year.</i>

14:49.305 --> 14:51.228
<i>He was the one who told me
to get in touch with you.</i>

14:51.307 --> 14:53.401
<i>Said the school needed
one of their own boys</i>

14:53.476 --> 14:55.319
<i>to come back home and take the reins.</i>

14:56.145 --> 14:59.194
What can I say? Hell, yes, I'm interested.

17:20.998 --> 17:23.421
- What's going on?
- I don't know. It wasn't me.

17:23.584 --> 17:26.713
- - Dad!
- Hannah! What is it?

17:26.796 --> 17:28.764
It was on my face! Get it off!

17:28.839 --> 17:29.920
What are you talking about?

17:29.924 --> 17:31.285
It's under the covers! Get it off!

17:36.764 --> 17:38.687
Dad!

17:38.766 --> 17:40.768
You did not just do that on my bed.

17:40.851 --> 17:42.091
Hannah, you told me to kill it.

17:42.103 --> 17:44.105
I told you to get it out.

17:44.564 --> 17:45.907
God, Dad.

17:48.818 --> 17:50.445
She told me to kill it.

17:54.198 --> 17:55.541
It's a moth!

18:04.208 --> 18:05.551
Make some noise

18:05.626 --> 18:07.970
for the most dazzling divas of dance

18:08.129 --> 18:10.632
who always bring it fierce,

18:10.798 --> 18:13.301
the Silverstars!

18:21.684 --> 18:23.686
Hey, are you okay?

18:25.146 --> 18:27.319
- I feel funny.
- What?

18:27.398 --> 18:28.445
I feel funny.

18:28.524 --> 18:29.776
What do you mean?

18:33.237 --> 18:34.659
I don't feel like me.

18:35.323 --> 18:38.076
I know this stuff with Mom and Dad sucks,

18:38.159 --> 18:41.413
but we're just the kids,
and they're the adults,

18:41.495 --> 18:43.418
and sometimes we just have to go along

18:43.497 --> 18:44.589
with their stupid mistakes.

18:45.166 --> 18:49.171
But I think you'll feel better
if you just stopped giving a shit.

19:01.891 --> 19:05.691
Hi! Hey! on...

19:06.354 --> 19:07.947
Oh, hi, Mommy.

19:08.022 --> 19:10.223
- I missed you guys a lot.
- I missed you, too, Mom.

19:10.232 --> 19:11.654
How was the weekend?

19:11.734 --> 19:13.862
It was good. We had pizza.

19:15.363 --> 19:18.162
Wow, yes, the new house has a pizza tree.

19:18.324 --> 19:20.364
- Is Jen's mom coming?
- Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

19:20.493 --> 19:22.416
Uh, your outfit is on your bed,

19:22.495 --> 19:25.795
and will you just take
one of your allergy pills just in case?

19:26.374 --> 19:28.797
If one of your players had food allergies,

19:28.876 --> 19:31.157
you'd be writing
threatening notes to the cafeteria ladies

19:31.170 --> 19:32.342
with detailed menu demands.

19:32.505 --> 19:33.597
Cut me some slack.

19:37.218 --> 19:38.970
I was going to go inside, get the boxes.

19:39.053 --> 19:40.930
- Okay.
- Okay.

19:47.645 --> 19:50.319
Hey, hey, what's going on with this guy?
Is he moving in, or what?

19:50.398 --> 19:53.902
No. No, we're just dating.

19:54.068 --> 19:55.411
You're just dating?

19:55.569 --> 19:56.912
He's getting awfully
comfortable around here,

19:56.987 --> 19:58.739
just bustling around the kitchen.

19:58.906 --> 20:00.249
Back off, Clyde.

20:00.574 --> 20:02.451
In his little antiseptic socks.

20:02.535 --> 20:03.912
Yeah, well, at least he's present.

20:04.078 --> 20:05.125
Excuse me?

20:05.287 --> 20:06.664
You know, presence, attendance,

20:06.831 --> 20:08.959
being in the moment,
as opposed to being absent.

20:09.041 --> 20:10.042
Absent like you were the whole...

20:10.126 --> 20:11.127
Stephanie, I know what it means.

20:11.210 --> 20:12.757
- I was being a smart-ass.
- Just don't forget your stuff.

20:12.837 --> 20:13.838
Yeah, fine.

20:53.294 --> 20:54.466
<i>Hello?</i>

20:54.628 --> 20:56.221
<i>- Clyde, it's Trevor.
- Hey.</i>

20:56.297 --> 20:57.890
<i>Got your plane ticket lined up,</i>

20:57.965 --> 20:59.967
<i>and I'm going to have
the university send a car,</i>

21:00.050 --> 21:01.222
<i>pick you up when you land.</i>

21:01.302 --> 21:02.394
Oh, you're rolling out the welcome.

21:02.470 --> 21:03.562
<i>You're going to love it.</i>

21:03.637 --> 21:06.060
Okay. Yeah, all right.
Well, thank you for calling.

21:06.140 --> 21:07.983
Keep me informed, all right? Bye.

21:08.309 --> 21:09.731
So she's in the middle row.

21:09.810 --> 21:11.608
Hey, Dad, you know Hannah's
big dance performance

21:11.687 --> 21:12.688
next week?
- Oh!

21:12.938 --> 21:15.236
It's her first time in
front of a real audience.

21:15.316 --> 21:17.114
- That's cool.
- Are you going to make it?

21:17.818 --> 21:19.161
Heck, yes, I'm coming.

21:19.320 --> 21:21.994
Mom will be there, so don't
feel obligated or anything.

21:22.156 --> 21:23.203
Are you kidding me?

21:23.282 --> 21:25.000
I'm going to be sitting in the front row.

21:27.161 --> 21:28.663
What's this in your mouth?

21:28.996 --> 21:30.748
Hannah, I told you your teeth were perfect.

21:30.831 --> 21:32.299
No, you said it was my decision,

21:32.374 --> 21:34.814
and I decided that
I don't want to go through life disfigured.

21:34.835 --> 21:37.338
Disfigured?
Who said your teeth were disfigured?

21:37.505 --> 21:39.758
I did. I'm totally disfigured.
It's horrible.

21:40.508 --> 21:42.135
You are perfect.

21:48.599 --> 21:49.942
Hannah.

21:58.442 --> 22:00.035
- Dad!
- What is it? What's wrong?

22:01.529 --> 22:02.701
Go back outside.

22:02.780 --> 22:03.781
Is there someone in the house?

22:03.864 --> 22:05.537
- Shh. Go.

22:22.049 --> 22:23.392
Who's there?

22:41.569 --> 22:42.912
Dad?

22:43.737 --> 22:46.991
It's okay, you guys.
I think we have a raccoon.

22:59.253 --> 23:00.675
Emily.

23:02.756 --> 23:04.429
Emily.

23:10.431 --> 23:13.435
Emily.

23:19.106 --> 23:22.781
Emily.

23:34.538 --> 23:36.131
Em, breakfast is ready!

23:40.961 --> 23:42.304
Ace!

23:45.049 --> 23:46.517
Can't you hear me yelling for you?

23:46.592 --> 23:47.718
Breakfast is ready.

23:59.688 --> 24:01.031
Em.

24:02.149 --> 24:03.492
What's wrong, Daddy?

24:08.572 --> 24:10.245
First the announcer
comes out and he announces us,

24:10.324 --> 24:12.668
and he's got, like,
the most obnoxious voice ever.

24:12.743 --> 24:14.416
I don't know why they don't let me do it.

24:14.495 --> 24:17.089
And he goes, like, "Make some noise"

24:17.164 --> 24:21.260
"for the most dazzling divas of dance,
who always keep it fierce,"

24:21.335 --> 24:23.633
"the Silverstars!"

24:23.796 --> 24:25.218
And we all have
to wear our hair in a ponytail

24:25.297 --> 24:26.423
so that we look the same,

24:26.507 --> 24:28.851
because we're, like, the chorus and whatnot
with the can-can, so...

24:28.926 --> 24:31.099
And I told Jen not to get her haircut,
because now it's too short

24:31.178 --> 24:32.350
and her mom's making her get extensions...

24:32.429 --> 24:33.646
Em, slow down.

24:33.722 --> 24:36.271
And they use real human hair,
like, Indian and Asian hair.

24:36.433 --> 24:38.527
I personally think that
that's really gross.

24:38.602 --> 24:39.603
Em...

24:39.687 --> 24:42.190
They sweep the hair
into these bins and then they weigh them,

24:42.356 --> 24:44.076
and then they take them
to the special place

24:44.108 --> 24:46.782
where they maneuver them
into, like, these wigs, and...

24:47.152 --> 24:48.199
Em, slow down!

24:51.573 --> 24:53.621
I'm sorry, Daddy! I'm sorry, Daddy!

24:53.784 --> 24:55.264
- I'm really sorry!
- Go to your room.

26:22.539 --> 26:24.962
What? Hannah, what happened?

26:25.125 --> 26:26.468
In there!

26:27.461 --> 26:28.804
Oh, my God.

26:50.984 --> 26:52.281
My God.

26:54.905 --> 26:56.657
Em? Stay there, Hannah.

27:00.994 --> 27:02.837
Close the door. Close it!

27:14.842 --> 27:16.844
Are you storing
any large amounts of fabrics,

27:16.927 --> 27:18.520
cotton, silk, somewhere in the house?

27:18.595 --> 27:19.938
Come on, man, you got to be kidding me.

27:20.013 --> 27:21.653
I don't want
to be in that house any more.

27:21.682 --> 27:23.402
Yeah, I know. Look, it's just moths.

27:23.433 --> 27:25.435
Moths are like butterflies without colors.

27:31.608 --> 27:33.702
Hey. are you okay?

27:35.028 --> 27:36.450
What happened?

27:41.451 --> 27:42.794
Creepy.

27:43.120 --> 27:47.466
I had no idea that
moths were attracted to pizza and soda.

27:48.041 --> 27:50.715
The pest control guy said
they can take care of it.

27:51.295 --> 27:53.889
I'm still getting your
email on my computer.

27:54.715 --> 27:57.639
- Want me to take care of it?
- Yes, please.

28:06.226 --> 28:09.230
- How was Wagner?
- It was good. Interesting.

28:10.814 --> 28:12.157
"Interesting."

28:12.316 --> 28:15.661
You know, "interesting" is Stephanie code
for you fell asleep.

28:15.819 --> 28:18.072
- No, I didn't.
- You totally fell asleep.

28:18.238 --> 28:19.740
I didn't fall asleep.

28:20.949 --> 28:24.169
Okay, I don't know what this file is.

28:25.078 --> 28:26.751
What am I doing?

28:27.247 --> 28:28.840
Don't you remember that?

28:28.999 --> 28:32.344
That was the weekend
that the kids were in camp, remember?

28:32.502 --> 28:34.095
<i>- Good morning.</i>
<i>- Good morning.</i>

28:34.254 --> 28:35.972
<i>Did you sleep okay?</i>

28:36.048 --> 28:38.016
<i>I did. It's a little hot in this house.</i>

28:38.175 --> 28:40.928
Oh, I do remember.

28:41.887 --> 28:42.979
No.

28:44.348 --> 28:45.691
What are you doing?

28:47.309 --> 28:49.357
That was a weekend.

28:50.020 --> 28:51.442
That was a weekend.

28:51.939 --> 28:53.111
Oh, Lord.

28:57.236 --> 28:58.488
Nice legs, I'll give you that.

28:58.570 --> 28:59.867
Oh, God.

29:03.784 --> 29:05.127
Remember when...

29:05.786 --> 29:07.459
- What?
- Nothing. Never mind.

29:11.458 --> 29:12.630
Okay.

29:14.711 --> 29:16.429
All right, there you go.

29:16.588 --> 29:19.137
I am successfully deleted
from your computer.

29:20.801 --> 29:22.144
Thank you.

29:25.973 --> 29:27.646
I've been meaning to ask you.

29:28.058 --> 29:30.152
Have you...

29:30.227 --> 29:32.229
Have you noticed
anything odd going on with Emily?

29:33.146 --> 29:34.489
Like what?

29:34.648 --> 29:36.321
I don't know. She...

29:36.400 --> 29:38.601
She has these moments where
she just kind of checks out.

29:39.653 --> 29:43.157
We've...
We've disrupted their whole lives.

29:43.323 --> 29:47.248
It's going to be a while before anything's
normal again, right?

29:51.665 --> 29:53.008
Yeah.

29:59.006 --> 30:01.475
- Okay. I'll see you soon.
- Okay.

30:01.633 --> 30:02.976
Thank you.

30:10.142 --> 30:12.236
Where's the communication?

30:12.311 --> 30:13.688
I don't hear anything out here.

30:15.063 --> 30:16.485
You going to pass it?

30:18.358 --> 30:19.905
No, you're going to shoot it.

30:20.068 --> 30:21.786
Put 20 minutes on the clock.

30:21.862 --> 30:24.365
We're going to run a
full half of basketball.

30:24.448 --> 30:25.916
If I don't see some hustle,

30:25.991 --> 30:27.538
we're all going to stay late and run lines.

30:27.617 --> 30:28.960
Let's go. Let's move.

30:29.119 --> 30:31.213
Hey, Coach, didn't you say
you had to be somewhere at 5:00?

30:31.288 --> 30:32.881
- What time is it?
- Past that.

30:34.374 --> 30:40.222
<i>Make some noise
for the most dazzling divas of dance</i>

30:40.380 --> 30:43.304
who always bring it fierce,

30:43.383 --> 30:46.057
the Silverstars!

31:01.485 --> 31:04.910
<i>Hannah, I'm so sorry
I missed your performance.</i>

31:06.448 --> 31:07.791
I screwed up.

31:07.866 --> 31:10.164
I promise you I'm going
to make it up to you.

31:10.827 --> 31:12.170
<i>She's mad at you.</i>

31:14.998 --> 31:16.375
Yeah, I know.

31:16.708 --> 31:18.051
Is my box all right?

31:20.420 --> 31:21.592
It's fine.

31:21.755 --> 31:23.757
<i>I don't want you going near it.</i>

31:26.176 --> 31:27.223
Okay.

31:27.302 --> 31:29.430
<i>Because I'm the only one
allowed to touch it.</i>

31:33.600 --> 31:36.103
Hey, Em, what's the deal with the box?

31:36.269 --> 31:38.271
<i>Just don't touch it, okay?</i>

31:40.607 --> 31:42.450
Okay. I won't.

31:44.611 --> 31:46.955
<i>- Good night, Daddy.
- Good night, baby girl.</i>

32:17.561 --> 32:19.234
What the hell is this?

34:45.625 --> 34:46.967
What's in this?

34:48.168 --> 34:49.670
Give it back!

34:50.297 --> 34:53.471
Give it back to me! Give it back to me!

34:55.969 --> 34:57.937
Give it back to me!

34:58.847 --> 35:00.190
No!

35:07.981 --> 35:11.986
Emily has displayed some
unusual behavior in the past few weeks.

35:12.152 --> 35:14.951
She is becoming distant from her friends,

35:15.113 --> 35:17.536
not doing her assignments.

35:17.991 --> 35:20.039
She seems to have lost interest in things

35:20.160 --> 35:23.039
that were once so important to her.

35:23.204 --> 35:25.502
Well, Em's been going through a lot lately.

35:26.541 --> 35:29.340
- You moved recently.
- Yeah, I moved.

35:29.669 --> 35:33.640
Stephanie has the girls at the same house

35:33.715 --> 35:35.036
they grew up in most of the time.

35:35.175 --> 35:36.518
How are things
in your new home?

35:36.676 --> 35:40.977
Things are fine.
Fine, given the circumstances.

35:41.556 --> 35:42.728
Circumstances?

35:42.891 --> 35:47.397
We're divorced.
That's always tough on the kids, isn't it?

35:48.188 --> 35:52.785
I think it would benefit Emily
to talk to someone about her feelings.

35:52.859 --> 35:54.202
Feelings? I...

35:56.029 --> 35:59.158
I talk to her about her
feelings all the time.

35:59.240 --> 36:00.412
About everything.

36:01.201 --> 36:04.125
Still,
she seems extremely frustrated.

36:04.204 --> 36:07.083
She scared everybody
with that box, Mrs. Brenek.

36:07.874 --> 36:09.922
A little time away from
it will do her good.

36:10.752 --> 36:13.801
That just doesn't sound like Emily at all.

36:13.880 --> 36:15.974
I mean, she's never gotten
into a fight, ever.

36:16.049 --> 36:17.596
This wasn't just a fight.

36:18.551 --> 36:19.894
This was violent.

36:21.930 --> 36:23.773
We've been separated for over a year

36:23.848 --> 36:25.145
and the kids have never had an issue.

36:25.308 --> 36:28.107
This weird behavior, there's
something else going on here.

36:28.186 --> 36:30.280
Yeah, maybe she's insecure, you know?

36:31.106 --> 36:33.359
Maybe she's afraid
you're not going to be there for her.

36:33.441 --> 36:35.239
Still getting your email.

36:35.318 --> 36:37.946
It's your flight confirmation
for North Carolina.

36:38.947 --> 36:41.871
- I was going to tell you about this.
- When? After you took the job?

36:41.950 --> 36:43.623
It's just to sit down and talk.

36:44.619 --> 36:47.293
If they offer it to you,
you going to take it?

36:49.124 --> 36:50.876
- Of course you are.
- Stephanie, wait.

36:50.959 --> 36:53.053
Of course you are.
Anything to be a big shot again.

36:53.128 --> 36:55.381
Meanwhile, your 10-year-old
girl's falling apart.

36:55.463 --> 36:57.636
Em's behavior's got
nothing to do with this.

36:57.716 --> 36:59.593
Great. Stay oblivious, Clyde.

36:59.676 --> 37:01.394
It seems to be working well for you.

37:01.469 --> 37:02.595
- Oh, come on.

37:04.472 --> 37:06.145
You gotta be kidding me.

37:09.811 --> 37:12.485
Hey! Stay away from my kid's teeth.

38:30.391 --> 38:31.734
Oh, no.

39:09.097 --> 39:13.978
So, Em, do you understand why
school was canceled today?

39:15.770 --> 39:17.317
Because Miss Shandy's dead.

39:18.481 --> 39:22.577
That's right. She was
in a horrible accident last night.

39:22.735 --> 39:25.989
Can you get my box for me?
It's still in the classroom.

39:34.122 --> 39:38.127
Let's... Let's talk
about this for a second, okay.

39:40.628 --> 39:43.131
Why is the box so important to you?

39:43.631 --> 39:46.635
Don't know. Just is.

39:48.970 --> 39:50.313
Okay.

39:52.640 --> 39:54.517
Um, you know, Emily,

39:57.979 --> 40:00.323
I noticed that sometimes you talk to it.

40:00.481 --> 40:02.483
I do not talk to the box.

40:03.484 --> 40:04.827
I talk to my friend.

40:06.029 --> 40:08.157
- Your friend?
- What?

40:09.032 --> 40:11.205
- You said you talk to your friend.
- Mmm-hmm.

40:11.492 --> 40:13.665
The one who lives in the box.

40:14.996 --> 40:16.873
Your friend lives inside the box?

40:17.206 --> 40:19.334
- What?
- He lives in there?

40:20.668 --> 40:23.842
It's a she. A woman.

40:28.509 --> 40:30.682
What exactly does she say to you, Emily?

40:31.554 --> 40:32.897
That I'm special.

40:35.558 --> 40:38.562
Well, you know, you are very special.

40:40.188 --> 40:41.656
You know, I'd sure like to meet her.

40:42.899 --> 40:45.698
Not possible. No one can see her.

40:46.736 --> 40:48.079
Not even me.

40:54.369 --> 40:55.712
Can I have some more?

40:56.871 --> 40:58.714
She's still hungry.

41:42.750 --> 41:46.254
Where's my box?

41:46.713 --> 41:48.090
I got rid of it, Em.

41:51.092 --> 41:52.935
Tell me where it is.

41:53.761 --> 41:55.104
It's not here.

41:56.764 --> 41:58.937
Then go get it.

41:59.475 --> 42:01.102
We're done with the box, Emily.

42:04.272 --> 42:06.616
- I'm calling Morn.
- And tell her what?

42:06.774 --> 42:09.197
- To come pick me up.
- That's not happening.

42:09.277 --> 42:10.699
And if you keep talking to me like this,

42:10.778 --> 42:12.951
you're going to be grounded
the rest of the weekend.

42:17.285 --> 42:18.832
I hate you.

42:18.995 --> 42:21.168
Go to your room.
That's it. Go to your room.

42:21.330 --> 42:22.673
I don't love you.

42:24.292 --> 42:26.636
- Emily...
- And Mommy doesn't love you.

42:27.670 --> 42:30.344
You think
you know everything, but you don't.

42:30.506 --> 42:32.600
You better knock it off. Stop it right now.

42:32.759 --> 42:34.352
Mommy loves Brett now.

42:35.094 --> 42:36.095
He makes her happy.

42:36.179 --> 42:37.431
You don't talk to your father this way.

42:37.513 --> 42:41.814
He does nice things for her!
Something you never did.

42:44.020 --> 42:45.067
- Ow! Daddy!

42:45.146 --> 42:46.944
- What are...
- What are you doing to me?

42:47.106 --> 42:48.483
Daddy?

42:50.651 --> 42:52.870
What are you... Emily!

42:54.655 --> 42:56.999
What are you doing to me, Daddy?

42:57.158 --> 42:59.661
- What are you doing, Dad?
- I'm not doing anything!

42:59.827 --> 43:00.999
Did you just hit her?

43:01.120 --> 43:02.320
No, damn it, I didn't hit her!

43:03.372 --> 43:04.373
Emily!

43:08.169 --> 43:10.843
Em! We need to talk.

43:26.687 --> 43:28.030
Emily!

43:32.527 --> 43:33.699
Em!

43:34.362 --> 43:35.614
Em!

43:36.364 --> 43:37.365
Em!

43:59.679 --> 44:00.851
There...

44:41.804 --> 44:43.852
Are you my friend from the box?

44:50.396 --> 44:53.400
No. No.

44:57.904 --> 45:01.374
Because my dad doesn't...

45:01.449 --> 45:03.247
My dad doesn't like me any more.

45:04.243 --> 45:05.586
No.

45:08.915 --> 45:11.134
What are you talking about?

45:14.170 --> 45:15.513
No!

45:17.006 --> 45:19.475
No! No!

45:32.855 --> 45:34.198
Em!

46:22.280 --> 46:23.623
Right.

46:24.865 --> 46:26.208
No, I gotta go.

46:26.534 --> 46:28.582
Judge Simmons has reviewed everything

46:28.703 --> 46:31.456
and is granting the
interim temporary order.

46:32.373 --> 46:34.216
So I can't see my kids?

46:34.375 --> 46:37.720
Based on Mrs. Brenek's report
about the bruise marks...

46:38.212 --> 46:39.464
Stephanie, this is ridiculous.

46:39.547 --> 46:41.140
You know I would never hit her.

46:41.215 --> 46:42.637
Judge Simmons will schedule
a full hearing.

46:42.717 --> 46:43.718
We'll be in touch with the court date.

46:43.801 --> 46:44.802
Thank you.

46:44.969 --> 46:46.221
- Wait. Wait, Stephanie.
- Mr. Brenek!

46:46.304 --> 46:48.227
Can we talk? Just the two of us?

46:48.306 --> 46:49.979
We can work this out, Stephanie.

46:50.141 --> 46:52.235
Mr. Brenek! You can state your case at...

46:52.393 --> 46:54.234
I'm not talking to you.
I'm talking to my wife!

46:55.146 --> 46:56.989
- Steph...
- Don't you touch me!

46:58.107 --> 47:01.236
What were you thinking?
What were you thinking?

47:03.070 --> 47:04.743
You destroyed this family,

47:04.822 --> 47:06.665
but I won't let you hurt the children.

47:10.578 --> 47:11.921
Just move.

47:12.580 --> 47:14.423
Just move to North Carolina.

47:16.250 --> 47:17.843
I don't want to see you again.

47:28.429 --> 47:31.273
<i>He's clearly unstable.
He's angry and he's confused</i>

47:31.432 --> 47:33.685
and he's taking this divorce
out on everyone around him.

47:33.768 --> 47:34.860
And it's the girls that
are paying the price.

47:35.019 --> 47:36.620
That's why Em's having such a hard time.

47:37.521 --> 47:39.273
Listen, I brought a stack
of DVDs from my collection.

47:39.357 --> 47:41.610
I thought maybe we'd have
a little movie night with the girls.

47:41.692 --> 47:43.786
That's a great idea.

47:43.944 --> 47:45.321
Watch something funny.

47:45.446 --> 47:47.326
Let's lighten the mood
around here a little bit.

47:48.949 --> 47:49.950
Okay.

47:56.290 --> 47:59.544
That's your second glass.
Save a little for dinner?

48:23.651 --> 48:24.743
Hey!

48:37.832 --> 48:39.175
What you got there?

48:47.258 --> 48:49.010
What you got in your hand? Come on.

48:52.096 --> 48:53.439
Can I see it?

48:57.184 --> 48:59.687
Honey, it's okay. Let me see it.

49:00.354 --> 49:01.697
Come on.

49:03.524 --> 49:04.867
Where'd you get this?

49:08.821 --> 49:10.494
<i>Where'd you get this, Em?</i>

49:20.207 --> 49:21.629
It's deliberate...

49:33.846 --> 49:34.847
Em?

49:38.142 --> 49:39.143
Em?

49:46.734 --> 49:48.407
I think you should leave.

49:49.069 --> 49:51.492
I think you should leave now.

49:51.655 --> 49:53.123
I don't like you!

49:55.159 --> 49:57.679
Well, you're just going to have to
get used to that, aren't you?

50:08.255 --> 50:11.134
Coach, you looking for the bathroom?

50:12.927 --> 50:14.850
What brings you to my class?

50:17.014 --> 50:18.857
Quite a find, Clyde.

50:19.433 --> 50:22.528
That's just it.
I have no idea what I've got here.

50:22.686 --> 50:23.886
Well, judging by the woodwork,

50:23.938 --> 50:26.782
I'd say it was from Poland, 1920s, '30s.

50:26.941 --> 50:29.535
Probably originated in a Jewish village,

50:29.610 --> 50:33.956
indicated by these Hebrew inscriptions.

50:35.616 --> 50:40.042
I think it says, "Dibbuk."

50:40.955 --> 50:43.959
It's the Hebrew word for
"dislocated spirit."

50:44.375 --> 50:46.798
It's a dibbuk box.

50:47.461 --> 50:50.135
So was it used for something religious?

50:50.297 --> 50:52.971
The more traditional branches of Judaism,

50:53.050 --> 50:55.052
especially in the Hasidic sects,

50:55.135 --> 51:00.733
believe in various spirits,
both benevolent and...

51:02.810 --> 51:06.986
- Benevolent and...
- Evil. Like demons.

51:08.232 --> 51:10.826
A dibbuk box was made with the belief

51:10.901 --> 51:14.701
that the evil itself could
somehow be contained.

51:16.323 --> 51:17.370
Think of it.

51:17.533 --> 51:22.539
If you believed such a thing,
that you could trap a demon.

51:25.332 --> 51:29.587
And now, it's in your hands, Coach Brenek.

51:29.670 --> 51:32.423
Carrying around this curse.

51:32.506 --> 51:36.261
Whoo... Very brave man.

51:38.012 --> 51:42.438
Whoever made this box
certainly had intense convictions.

51:42.516 --> 51:46.692
It's why they concealed this
lock and carved these words.

51:47.855 --> 51:50.699
Basically what they're saying is...

51:53.527 --> 51:56.030
"Warning. Deadly."

51:57.197 --> 51:59.120
"Do not open."

51:59.867 --> 52:02.370
So, don't open it.

53:08.560 --> 53:10.721
- Dad, what are you doing here?
- Where's your sister?

53:10.771 --> 53:11.818
Mom's at the drug store.

53:11.897 --> 53:13.114
She'd freak if she knew you were here.

53:13.190 --> 53:15.033
Hannah, I'm not
screwing around. I need to see Emily.

53:15.109 --> 53:18.283
She decided to stay home.
She's not feeling well.

53:18.862 --> 53:19.954
Dad!

53:35.295 --> 53:36.296
Em.

53:47.141 --> 53:50.315
"Whoever sits in the refuge
of the most high,"

53:51.645 --> 53:54.489
"he shall dwell in the
shade of the Almighty."

53:54.982 --> 53:57.610
"I will say of Hashem,"

53:57.776 --> 54:01.246
"He is my refuge, my fortress, my God."

54:02.823 --> 54:04.666
"I will trust in Him."

54:05.659 --> 54:08.913
"For He will deliver you
from the ensnaring trap"

54:09.246 --> 54:11.340
"from devastating pestilence..."

54:20.257 --> 54:22.726
"With his pinion He will cover you,"

54:22.801 --> 54:25.270
"and beneath His wings
you will be protected."

54:26.180 --> 54:28.228
"His truth is shield..."

54:31.351 --> 54:36.528
"His truth is shield and armor."

54:38.192 --> 54:40.945
"You shall not fear the
terror of night, nor..."

54:51.538 --> 54:52.881
Who are you?

54:56.376 --> 54:58.549
What do you want with my little girl?

55:00.464 --> 55:01.807
You tell me!

55:02.925 --> 55:04.268
What do you want?

55:06.345 --> 55:07.688
You tell me!

55:08.472 --> 55:09.564
Clyde!

55:10.057 --> 55:12.230
What are you doing in here? Get out!

55:13.101 --> 55:15.900
Get out of the house!
I'll call the police. Get out!

55:46.176 --> 55:47.644
What are you doing?

56:33.390 --> 56:34.733
Excuse me.

56:35.142 --> 56:36.485
Sorry.

56:36.685 --> 56:38.904
I get kind of lost when I'm listening.

56:39.146 --> 56:42.571
My name's Clyde Brenek.
I'm looking for Tzadok Shapir.

56:42.649 --> 56:43.992
Yeah, that's me.

56:44.610 --> 56:47.113
- We talked on the phone.
- Thank you for meeting me.

56:49.323 --> 56:50.324
Is that it?

56:52.451 --> 56:53.452
Yeah.

56:55.871 --> 56:57.418
All right.

56:57.497 --> 57:00.046
I'll take you
to see my father, the Rebbe Shapir,

57:00.834 --> 57:03.007
but I must tell you, he's traditional.

57:04.212 --> 57:05.555
Okay.

57:05.714 --> 57:07.842
All right. Everyone's waiting in the shul.

57:26.693 --> 57:28.070
Amen.

57:46.088 --> 57:48.716
My father asks if you could
show us what's in the bag.

58:05.107 --> 58:07.201
Rebbe Shapir wants to know
where you got this.

58:07.943 --> 58:09.741
I bought it at a yard sale.

58:09.903 --> 58:11.951
Did you open it?

58:14.783 --> 58:18.788
Tell us, did you open the box?

58:21.248 --> 58:23.046
- My daughter...

58:23.125 --> 58:24.502
My daughter opened it.

58:31.341 --> 58:33.719
What does this thing want
with my daughter?

58:37.055 --> 58:40.104
The dibbuk
looks for innocence. A pure soul.

58:41.268 --> 58:44.989
It will move back and forth from the box,

58:45.063 --> 58:47.566
searching for a proper host.

58:47.733 --> 58:52.409
The host begins to hear
voices, experience visions.

58:52.571 --> 58:55.541
All of this is the deception of the spirit

58:55.615 --> 58:58.960
to protect the host and drive others away.

59:00.912 --> 59:04.086
<i>The final stage is when the
dibbuk attaches to the host,</i>

59:04.916 --> 59:06.293
<i>the two becoming one.</i>

59:07.252 --> 59:10.927
<i>It will feed and take
until there is nothing left.</i>

59:11.757 --> 59:16.103
It wants only one thing,
that which it does not have.

59:17.012 --> 59:18.184
Leiben.

59:18.972 --> 59:20.144
Life.

59:30.275 --> 59:32.277
It's taking my daughter's life.

59:35.947 --> 59:37.324
How do I stop it?

59:38.658 --> 59:40.706
The only way to stop the dibbuk

59:40.869 --> 59:45.500
is by commanding it back
into the box by its name.

59:45.999 --> 59:47.342
I don't have its name.

59:48.794 --> 59:52.515
This is what I have. I need your help.

59:56.301 --> 01:00:00.306
I saw this ceremony, an exorcism.

01:00:00.472 --> 01:00:02.474
It is too great of a risk.

01:00:03.308 --> 01:00:06.903
The dibbuk could come upon anyone
attempting to perform the ceremony.

01:00:07.312 --> 01:00:08.655
No.

01:00:10.482 --> 01:00:12.826
No, wait. Wait, please.

01:00:15.987 --> 01:00:18.331
Someone here has to help me.

01:00:19.825 --> 01:00:21.702
It's not my little girl any more.

01:00:21.785 --> 01:00:25.881
When I look into her eyes,
it's this thing looking back at me.

01:00:27.874 --> 01:00:32.380
But my little girl, Emily,
she's in there, right?

01:00:34.381 --> 01:00:36.383
Please tell me she's in there.

01:00:38.218 --> 01:00:39.891
You have to help me.

01:00:55.569 --> 01:01:00.245
This must be left to the will of God.

01:01:04.744 --> 01:01:06.417
The will of God?

01:01:10.917 --> 01:01:13.841
If this were your child,

01:01:13.920 --> 01:01:16.093
would you leave it to the will of God?

01:01:38.445 --> 01:01:39.788
Mr. Brenek?

01:01:41.656 --> 01:01:42.999
I'm coming with you.

01:01:43.617 --> 01:01:44.618
Why?

01:01:45.160 --> 01:01:49.006
<i>Pikuach nefesh.</i>
A permitted violation of a Shabbat law.

01:01:49.623 --> 01:01:51.796
A human life is in danger.

01:01:51.875 --> 01:01:53.969
I am not only allowed, but required to act.

01:01:56.463 --> 01:01:57.806
Let's go.

01:03:24.718 --> 01:03:25.765
Em...

01:03:29.597 --> 01:03:30.940
What are you doing?

01:03:32.600 --> 01:03:33.726
Emma...

01:03:37.897 --> 01:03:39.274
Give me that, sweetie.

01:03:47.574 --> 01:03:49.247
Emily, what are you doing?

01:03:49.367 --> 01:03:51.085
Em's not here!

01:03:52.579 --> 01:03:55.253
It's okay, baby. Come here. Come here.

01:03:57.083 --> 01:03:59.757
You just stop this right now.
Come here. Come to Mommy.

01:03:59.919 --> 01:04:01.262
No!

01:04:01.588 --> 01:04:02.965
I'm not playing games now.

01:04:03.131 --> 01:04:04.474
Emily.

01:04:04.632 --> 01:04:08.637
I said, Em's not here!

01:04:10.430 --> 01:04:13.104
Emily, come here, honey.

01:04:27.614 --> 01:04:28.957
Em, where are you?

01:04:33.953 --> 01:04:35.626
Emily, come here, baby.

01:04:38.500 --> 01:04:39.843
Come here.

01:04:56.976 --> 01:04:58.478
Em, where are you?

01:05:02.023 --> 01:05:03.366
Em?

01:05:13.701 --> 01:05:15.044
Emily?

01:05:19.207 --> 01:05:20.550
Where are you?

01:05:29.175 --> 01:05:31.678
Mom, who am I?

01:05:33.888 --> 01:05:35.231
Oh, baby...

01:05:36.766 --> 01:05:38.359
Who am I, Mommy?

01:05:48.528 --> 01:05:49.871
Her face.

01:05:51.865 --> 01:05:53.367
You should have seen it.

01:05:56.035 --> 01:05:57.878
I was actually scared.

01:06:00.707 --> 01:06:02.880
I've never seen anything like that.

01:06:04.544 --> 01:06:06.296
You know, with everything that's going on,

01:06:06.379 --> 01:06:08.632
I think we need to have her see someone.

01:06:10.717 --> 01:06:13.971
I called a friend of mine.
She's a mental health specialist.

01:06:14.053 --> 01:06:15.646
She works with kids all the time.

01:06:15.722 --> 01:06:17.802
She said she can see Em
first thing tomorrow morning.

01:06:18.057 --> 01:06:21.152
Spend a couple of days giving her a
full evaluation at her facility.

01:06:21.311 --> 01:06:22.654
Okay.

01:06:26.733 --> 01:06:29.407
You can tell Em that we're just going away
for the weekend.

01:06:49.923 --> 01:06:53.268
Okay, everybody, let's go!

01:07:05.605 --> 01:07:06.606
Emily?

01:07:07.148 --> 01:07:08.491
Brett?

01:07:14.948 --> 01:07:16.291
You Okay?

01:07:22.789 --> 01:07:24.041
Em?

01:08:01.995 --> 01:08:03.338
Em?

01:08:04.831 --> 01:08:07.380
- Hannah!
- What's going on?

01:08:07.542 --> 01:08:08.589
Call 911!

01:08:09.335 --> 01:08:10.678
Just...

01:08:11.170 --> 01:08:13.548
What's wrong with her, Mom?
What's wrong with her?

01:08:28.020 --> 01:08:29.363
There has to be a name.

01:08:29.522 --> 01:08:31.694
I don't know. I've searched
every inch of that thing.

01:08:34.694 --> 01:08:37.287
The carvings, a prayer
from the Book of Psalms,

01:08:37.363 --> 01:08:39.866
the tokens placed inside,

01:08:40.366 --> 01:08:41.743
but why is there this mirror?

01:08:41.908 --> 01:08:44.957
If the spirit was contained,

01:08:45.037 --> 01:08:46.711
it would have to look upon itself,

01:08:46.872 --> 01:08:50.127
to be forever reminded
that it turned away from God.

01:08:51.627 --> 01:08:52.970
Jesus.

01:08:58.718 --> 01:09:03.224
"Abyzou."

01:09:04.890 --> 01:09:06.234
Abyzou.

01:09:08.060 --> 01:09:09.404
"Taker of children."

01:09:15.609 --> 01:09:16.907
Hurry.

01:09:23.576 --> 01:09:26.420
I'd like to schedule an MRI right away.

01:09:26.578 --> 01:09:27.751
Okay.

01:09:28.706 --> 01:09:32.210
<i>Emily, we're going to slide you
into this machine here.</i>

01:09:32.542 --> 01:09:35.011
<i>Just think of it as a great big camera.</i>

01:09:35.087 --> 01:09:36.385
<i>Lets us take a look inside.</i>

01:09:36.464 --> 01:09:38.886
- Am I okay?
- Yeah, baby. Yeah.

01:09:39.050 --> 01:09:41.724
Everything's going to be all right.
Don't be afraid, okay.

01:09:41.803 --> 01:09:44.225
We're going to be in the other room. Okay?

01:09:45.055 --> 01:09:46.433
You'll hear some noises, Emily.

01:09:46.557 --> 01:09:48.229
It's nothing to be scared of.

01:09:50.060 --> 01:09:51.483
I love you.

01:09:51.562 --> 01:09:53.609
I need you to stay very, very still for me.

01:10:03.408 --> 01:10:05.410
All right, here we go.

01:10:19.298 --> 01:10:21.596
- Can I close my eyes?
<i>- Of course.</i>

01:10:22.093 --> 01:10:24.095
<i>We're going to start taking pictures now.</i>

01:10:31.644 --> 01:10:34.147
Looking good. Good tissue.

01:10:46.451 --> 01:10:47.953
<i>Doing great, Emily.</i>

01:10:55.293 --> 01:10:57.136
There must be some interference.

01:11:13.144 --> 01:11:15.693
What's happening?
Is she all right in there by herself?

01:11:15.772 --> 01:11:17.774
- She's fine.
- Get somebody up here

01:11:17.857 --> 01:11:19.017
who knows what they're doing.

01:11:19.025 --> 01:11:20.106
What's going on?

01:11:20.151 --> 01:11:22.231
Things like this
will happen once in a while.

01:11:39.212 --> 01:11:40.384
Oh, my God.

01:11:44.008 --> 01:11:45.885
There's something in there with her!

01:12:14.622 --> 01:12:15.623
Hey.

01:12:17.041 --> 01:12:18.384
Hi.

01:12:20.044 --> 01:12:22.046
- Dad, I'm so sorry.
- No.

01:12:33.891 --> 01:12:38.237
I saw something...

01:12:43.484 --> 01:12:45.612
I saw something in her.

01:12:46.737 --> 01:12:49.581
The doctors, they can't help us, can they?

01:12:51.325 --> 01:12:53.327
Just, I need you to trust me, okay?

01:12:55.454 --> 01:12:56.876
Are you able to get her out?

01:12:56.956 --> 01:12:59.550
No. We're going to have to do it here.

01:12:59.625 --> 01:13:00.626
Here?

01:13:02.420 --> 01:13:03.763
Great.

01:13:06.340 --> 01:13:09.844
I hate hospitals. People die here.

01:13:16.809 --> 01:13:18.152
Hey.

01:13:19.896 --> 01:13:22.900
This is Tzadok. Tzadok, this is my family.

01:13:24.650 --> 01:13:26.072
Thank you for coming.

01:13:30.406 --> 01:13:32.158
- Can you help us?
- Of course.

01:13:32.491 --> 01:13:34.209
What do I look like, a doctor?

01:13:43.669 --> 01:13:47.390
It doesn't want me here.
We need a private place.

01:14:11.364 --> 01:14:13.207
- Thank you.

01:14:19.288 --> 01:14:22.713
There's a physical therapy room down there.
My players use it sometimes.

01:14:22.792 --> 01:14:24.886
No one uses it after 6:00.

01:14:39.058 --> 01:14:40.560
Oh, baby.

01:14:40.643 --> 01:14:42.395
Take these candles and light them.

01:14:42.478 --> 01:14:44.196
- How many?
- Seven.

01:14:52.446 --> 01:14:53.868
As the others have
done in the past, I have asked you

01:14:53.948 --> 01:14:55.668
to put something
from your heart in the box.

01:14:55.741 --> 01:14:58.335
It is believed that this
essence will bind the prayer.

01:14:58.494 --> 01:14:59.996
This belonged to my grandfather.

01:15:00.162 --> 01:15:02.836
The strength of my entire
family is with us.

01:15:03.082 --> 01:15:04.584
Hannah? Honey?

01:15:08.254 --> 01:15:09.255
Stephanie.

01:15:11.590 --> 01:15:13.263
Your wedding ring.

01:15:13.592 --> 01:15:15.765
Once we begin,
we must complete the ceremony.

01:15:15.928 --> 01:15:17.555
The dibbuk will
do everything it can to stop us.

01:15:17.638 --> 01:15:18.639
No, baby.

01:15:18.764 --> 01:15:21.893
Even in the face of this evil,
our faith must remain unwavering.

01:15:22.059 --> 01:15:23.936
- Okay.
- Please, God.

01:15:25.563 --> 01:15:28.112
Oil of two olive trees.
Oil represents light.

01:15:28.274 --> 01:15:29.651
Water represents darkness.

01:15:30.735 --> 01:15:33.033
May God separate between these two

01:15:33.112 --> 01:15:35.615
as only light can dispel darkness.

01:15:49.128 --> 01:15:51.847
"Nor the destruction that ravages at noon."

01:15:51.922 --> 01:15:53.845
"Put Your hands on her."

01:15:53.924 --> 01:15:56.177
"You need only look with Your"

01:15:56.260 --> 01:15:59.104
"and the punishment
of the wicked illuminator."

01:16:10.775 --> 01:16:11.822
Shut up!

01:16:14.111 --> 01:16:17.456
You take me! Take me!

01:16:19.825 --> 01:16:23.204
Everybody, put your hands on her!

01:16:23.287 --> 01:16:26.382
Cast all fear from your hearts!

01:16:31.378 --> 01:16:33.005
Emily!

01:16:35.341 --> 01:16:37.514
You die!

01:16:42.181 --> 01:16:43.182
Emily!

01:16:45.226 --> 01:16:46.227
Daddy!

01:16:46.811 --> 01:16:49.064
You let my daughter go! Take me!

01:16:49.230 --> 01:16:50.573
You take me instead!

01:16:57.321 --> 01:16:58.322
No!

01:16:58.489 --> 01:17:00.742
That is no longer your daughter!

01:17:00.908 --> 01:17:02.251
Clyde!

01:17:19.051 --> 01:17:20.223
Em?

01:17:34.191 --> 01:17:35.534
Em?

01:18:11.228 --> 01:18:13.230
Daddy, you scared me.

01:18:18.110 --> 01:18:20.579
Daddy, you scared me.

01:18:26.410 --> 01:18:28.754
Daddy, you scared me.

01:18:35.085 --> 01:18:37.304
Daddy, you scared me.

01:18:42.760 --> 01:18:44.728
Daddy, you scare me.

01:18:49.558 --> 01:18:51.856
- Dad, you scare me.

01:19:25.803 --> 01:19:29.023
Take me!
You take me instead!

01:19:31.642 --> 01:19:32.985
Em!

01:19:33.894 --> 01:19:35.237
Clyde?

01:19:48.075 --> 01:19:49.076
Daddy?

01:19:50.202 --> 01:19:51.795
Em, is that you?

01:19:59.128 --> 01:20:00.471
Clyde!

01:20:15.728 --> 01:20:17.071
Daddy?

01:20:20.649 --> 01:20:24.449
- Is it okay? Okay?
- Em...

01:20:24.611 --> 01:20:25.988
Oh, thank God.

01:20:27.698 --> 01:20:28.699
Not right.

01:20:29.700 --> 01:20:31.043
This is all wrong.

01:20:32.036 --> 01:20:33.538
Guys, this is not right.

01:20:34.371 --> 01:20:35.714
Where is it?

01:20:36.874 --> 01:20:38.217
Where's the dibbuk?

01:20:40.127 --> 01:20:41.470
Abyzou.

01:20:43.714 --> 01:20:46.137
Abyzou. Abyzou.

01:20:47.092 --> 01:20:48.435
Abyzou!

01:20:49.261 --> 01:20:52.060
Abyzou!

01:20:53.098 --> 01:20:53.598
Abyzou!

01:21:00.773 --> 01:21:01.273
Abyzou!

01:21:07.404 --> 01:21:07.904
Abyzou!

01:21:14.078 --> 01:21:17.423
Abyzou!

01:21:18.415 --> 01:21:20.213
Abyzou!

01:21:20.292 --> 01:21:21.464
Clyde!

01:21:23.253 --> 01:21:24.596
Hannah!

01:21:24.797 --> 01:21:26.299
Daddy!

01:21:33.430 --> 01:21:35.649
No! No!

01:21:35.808 --> 01:21:36.809
Emily!

01:21:41.105 --> 01:21:46.202
I say to you that
He will save you from the ensnaring trap!

01:21:46.360 --> 01:21:48.454
He will instruct His angels in your behalf

01:21:48.529 --> 01:21:51.203
to guard you in all your ways.

01:21:54.952 --> 01:21:59.879
I say to you
in the name of God, leave this flesh!

01:22:00.624 --> 01:22:03.298
Abyzou!

01:22:07.339 --> 01:22:09.933
I say to the Lord,
my God in whom I trust,

01:22:10.300 --> 01:22:13.804
He will save you from
the destruction and pestilence.

01:22:21.103 --> 01:22:21.603
Abyzou!

01:22:33.407 --> 01:22:36.786
You are cast away from the eyes of God!

01:22:36.952 --> 01:22:37.953
Daddy!

01:22:38.036 --> 01:22:38.536
Abyzou!

01:22:44.001 --> 01:22:45.423
Abyzou!

01:23:33.050 --> 01:23:34.142
Hannah?

01:23:37.387 --> 01:23:38.730
Daddy...

01:23:43.018 --> 01:23:44.361
It's okay.

01:24:26.478 --> 01:24:27.479
Hi.

01:25:12.482 --> 01:25:16.578
Oh, it's just a cough.

01:25:28.081 --> 01:25:31.756
Tzadok, hey! I...
I'm calling to say thank you.

01:25:31.918 --> 01:25:34.467
Clyde! I was going to call.

01:25:34.546 --> 01:25:36.014
Figure out how to get your car back to you.

01:25:36.173 --> 01:25:39.177
<i>You keep it.
I am not going to be going anywhere.</i>

01:25:40.302 --> 01:25:41.645
<i>How's the family?</i>

01:25:41.803 --> 01:25:44.226
<i>Perfect. More than perfect.</i>

01:25:45.015 --> 01:25:46.483
<i>So what are you going to do with it?</i>

01:25:46.558 --> 01:25:47.559
<i>I'm not sure.</i>

01:25:47.726 --> 01:25:49.478
<i>I'm going to speak with my father.</i>

01:25:49.561 --> 01:25:50.983
<i>We'll find a safe place for it.</i>

01:25:51.146 --> 01:25:54.195
<i>Okay. Goodbye, Tzadok.</i>

01:25:54.358 --> 01:25:55.701
<i>Goodbye, Clyde.</i>
