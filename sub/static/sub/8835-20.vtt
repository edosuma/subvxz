02:33.404 --> 02:34.572

02:38.868 --> 02:41.454
UH-UH.

03:28.835 --> 03:32.297
YEAH, WELL, I JUST WANT
ONE LITTLE DRINK'S ALL.

03:33.506 --> 03:35.800

03:41.347 --> 03:44.893
NOW, WHERE'S MY WHISKEY,

03:45.059 --> 03:47.520

03:57.196 --> 03:59.532
I BUSTED IT.

03:59.699 --> 04:00.825

04:07.040 --> 04:08.541
WHY?

04:08.708 --> 04:10.793
[SOBBING]

04:38.863 --> 04:40.990
[BELL CLANGING]

04:42.533 --> 04:43.493
ALL RIGHT, CHILDREN.

04:43.660 --> 04:44.994
I WOULD LIKE THE FIRST
ARITHMETIC CLASS

04:45.161 --> 04:46.079
TO START
ON THESE PROBLEMS

04:46.245 --> 04:48.414
THAT I'VE WRITTEN
ON THE BOARD.

04:48.581 --> 04:49.582
THE REST OF YOU WILL
PLEASE CONTINUE

04:49.749 --> 04:53.169
WITH THE LESSONS
I GAVE YOU YESTERDAY.

04:53.336 --> 04:55.713
I'M GOING TO BE OUT OF THE
CLASSROOM FOR A WHILE.

05:01.552 --> 05:03.554
GRAHAM? WOULD YOU PLEASE
STEP OUTSIDE WITH ME?

05:21.155 --> 05:23.449
[DOOR OPENS]
HEY,DOC?

05:23.616 --> 05:24.784
BACK HERE.

05:27.161 --> 05:28.121
HOW'RE YOU DOING?

05:28.287 --> 05:29.205
WHAT CAN I DO
FOR YOU, INGALLS?

05:29.372 --> 05:30.707
YOU'VE ALREADY
DONE IT, DOC.

05:30.873 --> 05:32.417
IT'S FOR ALL THOSE TRIPS
YOU MADE OUT TO THE HOUSE

05:32.583 --> 05:34.252
LAST WINTER WHEN
THE GIRLS WERE SICK.

05:34.419 --> 05:36.629
HANSON GAVE ME SOME
OF MY BACK WAGES.

05:36.796 --> 05:38.381
YOU'RE THE FIRST ONE
I WANTED TO PAY.

05:38.548 --> 05:40.258
WELL, THANK YOU,
INGALLS.

05:40.425 --> 05:42.301
I'M USUALLY THE LAST
ONE AROUND HERE.

05:42.468 --> 05:43.344
WOULD YOU LIKE
SOME COFFEE?

05:43.511 --> 05:44.637
YEAH, LOVE IT.

05:50.977 --> 05:51.853
MISS BEADLE.

05:52.020 --> 05:52.812
MORNING.

05:52.979 --> 05:54.105
MORNING,
MISS BEADLE.

05:55.815 --> 05:56.899
GRAHAM?

05:59.861 --> 06:01.988
WELL, WHAT HAPPENED
TO YOU?

06:02.155 --> 06:03.281
GET IN
ANOTHER FIGHT?

06:04.490 --> 06:06.242
TAKE OFF YOUR SHIRT,
GRAHAM.

06:09.787 --> 06:10.705
I THINK I BETTER GO.

06:10.872 --> 06:12.373
PLEASE WAIT A MOMENT,
MR. INGALLS.

06:14.751 --> 06:15.877
COME ON, GRAHAM.

06:19.505 --> 06:20.882
NOW TAKE YOUR SHIRT OFF.

06:44.030 --> 06:45.948
WELL, THIS IS GONNA
STING A LITTLE.

06:52.914 --> 06:54.749
DID YOU GET HIT
ANYWHERE ELSE?

06:54.916 --> 06:58.044
NO, SIR. I FELL OUT
OF A TREE.

06:58.211 --> 06:59.045
HMM.

06:59.212 --> 07:01.589
WELL, THAT MUST
HAVE BEEN SOME TREE.

07:07.553 --> 07:10.056
ALL RIGHT. YOU CAN PUT
YOUR SHIRT BACK ON.

07:12.433 --> 07:13.518
GRAHAM?

07:14.602 --> 07:16.938
WOULD YOU MIND WAITING
OUTSIDE FOR A MOMENT?

07:17.105 --> 07:18.481
THEN WE CAN GO BACK
TO SCHOOL.

07:31.577 --> 07:34.372
HOW MANY TIMES IS
THAT NOW, MISS BEADLE?

07:34.539 --> 07:38.167
4, IN AS MANY MONTHS.
EVERY TIME, IT GETS WORSE.

07:39.794 --> 07:41.254
HE'S GONNA CRIPPLE
THAT BOY.

07:41.420 --> 07:43.548
WE CAN'T LET THAT HAPPEN.

07:43.714 --> 07:45.883
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?
THE MAN'S A DRUNK.

07:46.050 --> 07:49.428
YOU CAN'T TALK TO HIM ABOUT HIS DRINKING.
I'VE TRIED.

07:49.595 --> 07:52.849
REVEREND ALDEN TRIED,
AND HE WOULDN'T LISTEN.

07:53.015 --> 07:56.102
ARE YOU TWO TELLING ME THAT THERE'S
NOTHING THAT CAN BE DONE?!

07:56.269 --> 07:57.937
IF WE WEREN'T SO
DOGGONE CMLIZED,

07:58.104 --> 08:00.314
I'D SUGGEST A PUBLIC
HORSEWHIPPING.

08:00.481 --> 08:01.566
HE WOULDN'T LISTEN
TO YOU, DOC,

08:01.732 --> 08:03.067
AND HE WOULDN'T LISTEN
TO THE REVEREND.

08:03.234 --> 08:05.027
WHAT ABOUT THE WHOLE TOWN?
WHAT IF WE ALL GOT TOGETHER?

08:05.194 --> 08:07.363
THAT MIGHT HAVE
SOME EFFECT ON HIM.

08:07.530 --> 08:09.532
HOW WOULD YOU
MANAGE THAT?

08:09.699 --> 08:12.243
TOWN MEETING
RIGHT AFTER CHURCH.

08:12.410 --> 08:13.870
THERE'S NO DOUBT THAT BOY
NEEDS HELP.

08:15.204 --> 08:18.249
HIS FATHER
NEEDS HELP, TOO.

08:18.416 --> 08:21.127
RIGHT NOW, YOU'RE A BETTER
CHRISTIAN THAN I AM, DOC.

08:21.294 --> 08:23.504
I DON'T CARE ABOUT HIS FATHER.
I JUST CARE ABOUT THE BOY.

08:24.463 --> 08:25.590
MISS BEADLE.

08:34.432 --> 08:36.642
JOHN STEWART WON'T LISTEN
TO ANY OF US INDMDUALLY,

08:36.809 --> 08:38.311
BUT IF WE ALL
GET TOGETHER,

08:38.477 --> 08:39.395
MAKE IT A COMMUNITY
MATTER,

08:39.562 --> 08:41.564
WE MIGHT HAVE
SOME EFFECT ON HIM.

08:41.731 --> 08:43.858
AND IF HE TELLS US
TO MIND OUR OWN BUSINESS?

08:44.025 --> 08:45.193
THEN WE HAVE NO CHOICE.

08:45.359 --> 08:46.861
WE DON'T HAVE A CONSTABLE
OR A JAIL HERE,

08:47.028 --> 08:48.988
BUT THEY'VE GOT BOTH IN SPRINGFIELD.
IF WE HAVE TO...

08:49.155 --> 08:50.281
[DOOR OPENS]

08:58.998 --> 09:00.124
OH.

09:05.796 --> 09:07.632
YOU TALKING ABOUT ME?

09:09.842 --> 09:11.761
WELL, HERE I AM.

09:25.191 --> 09:26.692
WELL!

09:26.859 --> 09:29.070
COME ON! LET'S HEAR
WHAT YOU GOT TO SAY.

09:31.113 --> 09:32.740
IF ANYBODY GOT THE GUTS.

09:37.954 --> 09:39.038
HUH?

09:49.882 --> 09:52.218
YOU'RE WELCOME HERE. lT'LL SAVE
US A TRIP OUT TO YOUR PLACE.

09:56.681 --> 10:00.726
WELL, SPEAK YOUR PIECE,
INGALLS.

10:00.893 --> 10:03.187
I'M REAL ANXIOUS
TO KNOW

10:03.354 --> 10:05.898
WHY YOU ALL ARE HOLDING
THESE MEETINGS

10:06.065 --> 10:10.152
TO STICK YOUR NOSES INTO
MY PERSONAL AFFAIRS.

10:14.240 --> 10:16.325
WHY DON'T YOU HAVE
YOUR BOY WAIT OUTSIDE.

10:16.492 --> 10:18.953
NO. MY BOY'LL STAY
RIGHT HERE WITH ME.

10:19.120 --> 10:20.663
WHY DON'T YOU
START TALKING?

10:20.830 --> 10:24.542
THERE'S NO REASON WHY THE BOY
HAS TO HEAR ANY OF THIS.

10:24.709 --> 10:27.753
HE STAYS RIGHT HERE.

10:27.920 --> 10:28.754
ALL RIGHT, SUIT YOURSELF.

10:28.921 --> 10:30.089
WE KNOW YOU MISTREAT
YOUR SON,

10:30.256 --> 10:32.091
AND WE'RE HERE TO DECIDE
WHAT TO DO ABOUT IT.

10:37.513 --> 10:39.765
WELL, WELL, WELL.
YOU CAN'T--WHAT--

10:39.932 --> 10:40.766
YOU CAN'T DO ANYTHING

10:40.933 --> 10:41.726
ABOUT HIM OR ME.

10:41.892 --> 10:42.643
OH, YES, WE CAN.

10:42.810 --> 10:44.186
WHAT GIVES YOU
THE RIGHT?!

10:44.353 --> 10:46.647
IT'S NOT JUST ME, IT'S
EVERYBODY, THE WHOLE TOWN.

10:52.361 --> 10:54.780
WHOLE...TOWN.

10:58.117 --> 10:59.785
YOU GOT NO RIGHT
TO DO ANYTHING

10:59.952 --> 11:01.203
ONE WAY OR THE OTHER.

11:03.664 --> 11:05.333
WE CAN TAKE YOUR BOY
AWAY FROM YOU.

11:08.794 --> 11:10.671
NO, PLEASE!

11:10.838 --> 11:12.715
PLEASE DON'T TAKE ME
AWAY FROM PA.

11:12.882 --> 11:16.218
I'M BAD SOMETIMES,
AND HE HAS TO WHIP ME.

11:16.385 --> 11:19.388
IT ISN'T HIS FAULT
THAT I MAKE HIM MAD SOMETIMES.

11:19.555 --> 11:23.142
I WANNA BE WITH HIM.
I WON'T LIVE ANYWHERE ELSE.

11:23.309 --> 11:24.810
I LOVE MY PA.

11:57.551 --> 11:58.427
GIRLS ASLEEP?

11:58.594 --> 11:59.678
YEAH.

12:04.308 --> 12:06.936
CAN'T GET IT OUT OF
YOUR HEAD, CAN YOU?

12:07.103 --> 12:09.230
HOW CAN ANYONE
BEAT A CHILD?

12:11.857 --> 12:15.569
I DON'T KNOW.
IT'S HARD TO BELIEVE.

12:15.736 --> 12:16.737
IT'S EVEN HARDER
TO BELIEVE

12:16.904 --> 12:19.198
THAT THE BOY
STILL LOVES HIM.

12:19.365 --> 12:23.327
EVEN A DOG STAYS WITH A
MASTER THAT BEATS HIM.

12:23.494 --> 12:27.206
THAT'S NOT A VERY
SATISFACTORY ANSWER, CHARLES.

12:27.373 --> 12:31.502
I'M AFRAID THERE ARE
NO ANSWERS, JUST FACTS.

12:31.669 --> 12:33.546
HE BEATS THE BOY,
AND HE MAY DO IT AGAIN.

12:35.673 --> 12:36.590
WELL, IF HE DOES,
IT'S GONNA BE

12:36.757 --> 12:39.885
ON EVERYBODY'S
CONSCIENCE.

12:40.052 --> 12:41.846
GRAHAM WANTS HIS FATHER.
WHAT CAN WE DO?

12:46.725 --> 12:47.977
PRAY FOR HIM.

TO YOU A MOMENT, PLEASE?

YES, MISS BEADLE?

13:28.017 --> 13:29.143
IS YOUR FATHER
IN TOWN TODAY?

13:29.310 --> 13:31.145
YES, HE'S OVER
AT THE MILL.

13:31.312 --> 13:32.396
OH, GOOD. TELL THE
CHILDREN I'LL BE BACK

13:32.563 --> 13:33.772
IN ABOUT 10 MINUTES.

13:33.939 --> 13:35.608
SOMETHING WRONG,
MISS BEADLE?

13:35.774 --> 13:36.859
I HOPE NOT.

13:44.116 --> 13:45.367
MR. INGALLS?

13:45.534 --> 13:46.785
OH, MORNING,
MISS BEADLE.

13:46.952 --> 13:48.370
GRAHAM STEWART DIDN'T COME
TO SCHOOL TODAY,

13:48.537 --> 13:50.789
AND I'M TERRIBLY WORRIED.

13:50.956 --> 13:52.249
MAYBE HE'S JUST LATE.

13:52.416 --> 13:55.878
NO, HE'S NEVER BEEN
THIS LATE.

13:56.045 --> 13:57.546
I'VE GOT MY WAGON RIGHT
ACROSS THE BRIDGE THERE.

13:57.713 --> 13:58.589
I'LL TAKE A RIDE OUT.

13:58.756 --> 13:59.840
I'D APPRECIATE IT.

14:00.007 --> 14:00.966
I'LL GET WORD BACK
TO YOU.

14:01.133 --> 14:02.218
THANK YOU.

16:16.101 --> 16:17.853
HOW BAD IS HE, DOC?

16:18.020 --> 16:20.439
I WON'T KNOW
TILL HE COMES TO.

16:22.691 --> 16:24.401
IT'S A GOOD THING YOU
WENT OUT THERE, INGALLS.

16:26.570 --> 16:28.447
TOO LATE.

16:28.614 --> 16:29.948
JUST TOO LATE.

16:30.115 --> 16:32.117
OH, WHAT IF YOU HAD GOT
OUT THERE TO STOP HIM?

16:32.284 --> 16:33.827
WHAT ABOUT THE NEXT
TIME, AND THE NEXT?

16:33.994 --> 16:36.121
THERE ISN'T GONNA
BE A NEXT TIME, DOC.

16:36.288 --> 16:37.706
THERE'D
BETTER NOT BE.

16:37.873 --> 16:42.378
[DOOR OPENS] Man: DOC!
DOC, YOU GOT MY BOY?

16:42.544 --> 16:43.712
WHERE IS HE? DOC!

16:46.590 --> 16:49.343
MRS. INGALLS SAID YOU'D
PROBABLY BE HERE.

16:49.510 --> 16:53.722
NOW, WHAT'S GOING ON? YOU AND
DOC TRYING TO STEAL MY BOY?

16:53.889 --> 16:54.640
WELL, WHERE IS HE?

16:54.807 --> 16:56.308
YOU HIDING HIM
BACK THERE?

16:58.686 --> 17:01.146
DON'T GET IN MY WAY,
INGALLS.

17:01.313 --> 17:02.147
I WANT MY BOY.

17:02.314 --> 17:04.441
YOU'RE NOT GONNA
HAVE HIM.

17:04.608 --> 17:06.402
HE'S IN BAD SHAPE.
HE'S STILL UNCONSCIOUS.

17:09.321 --> 17:11.240
UH...

17:11.407 --> 17:12.449
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

17:12.616 --> 17:13.784
COME ON,
GET OUT OF MY...

17:15.828 --> 17:16.912
NOW YOU LISTEN TO ME.

17:17.079 --> 17:18.497
I WENT OUT TO YOUR
PLACE AN HOUR AGO

17:18.664 --> 17:20.624
AND I FOUND YOUR SON LYING
UNCONSCIOUS BEHIND A TABLE.

17:20.791 --> 17:22.751
ARE YOU GONNA TELL ME
HE DID THAT TO HIMSELF?

17:25.087 --> 17:26.922
I DON'T BELIEVE THAT.

17:27.089 --> 17:28.215
YOU DON'T REMEMBER.

17:28.382 --> 17:29.508
WHAT, SOMEBODY ELSE
WENT OUT THERE

17:29.675 --> 17:34.847
AND TORE UP YOUR HOUSE
AND BEAT UP YOUR SON?

17:35.013 --> 17:36.098
L...

17:37.683 --> 17:40.144
I CAN'T REMEMBER.

17:40.310 --> 17:42.104
MAYBE YOU OUGHT TO SEE
FOR YOURSELF.

18:12.176 --> 18:13.260
GRAHAM?

18:39.244 --> 18:40.496
GOD HELP ME, WILL YOU?

18:42.539 --> 18:45.501
OH, PLEASE, GOD.

18:49.963 --> 18:51.715
IN THE NAME OF GOD, HELP ME.

19:03.060 --> 19:05.312
THAT MAN IS A MONSTER!

19:05.479 --> 19:07.231
WHAT I WANNA KNOW, IS HE
GONNA COME BUSTING IN HERE

19:07.397 --> 19:08.649
LIKE HE DID
LAST TIME?

19:08.816 --> 19:11.777
NO. HE'S LOCKED IN MY
STOREROOM AT THE MILL.

19:11.944 --> 19:14.780
HE'S ASLEEP. HE WILL BE
FOR SEVERAL HOURS.

19:14.947 --> 19:16.657
A HORSE WHIP WOULD BE GOOD
FOR WHAT AILS HIM.

19:16.824 --> 19:18.826
SOME TAR AND FEATHERS
THROWED IN.

19:18.992 --> 19:20.118
WE CAME HERE
TO HELP THE BOY.

19:20.285 --> 19:22.788
ALL I HEAR IS TALK
ABOUT PUNISHING THE FATHER.

19:22.955 --> 19:24.164
HE'S EARNED PUNISHMENT.

19:24.331 --> 19:27.042
HURT THE FATHER,
AND YOU HURT THE BOY,

19:27.209 --> 19:29.670
BECAUSE HE LOVES HIS FATHER.

19:29.837 --> 19:33.131
DESTROY THE FATHER,
AND YOU DESTROY THE BOY.

19:33.298 --> 19:34.967
DR. BAKER?

19:35.133 --> 19:36.802
JOHN STEWART
IS A SICK MAN.

19:36.969 --> 19:39.096
Kennedy: "RIGHT OUT
OF A BOTTLE" SICK.

19:39.263 --> 19:40.430
IF ONE OF YOUR ANIMALS
WAS SICK,

19:40.597 --> 19:43.559
YOU'D DO ANYTHING
TO CURE IT.

19:43.725 --> 19:47.145
CAN YOU DO ANY LESS
FOR A SICK MAN?

19:47.312 --> 19:50.649
CURE HIM. SAVE HIM,

19:50.816 --> 19:52.693
AND YOU SAVE TWO PEOPLE.

19:52.860 --> 19:55.696
OH, YOU'RE ASKING
FOR THE IMPOSSIBLE.

19:55.863 --> 19:57.990
NO, KENNEDY,
IT'S NOT IMPOSSIBLE,

19:58.156 --> 20:00.200
GIVEN THE RIGHT KIND
OF HELP.

20:00.367 --> 20:02.452
AND I'M TALKING ABOUT
SOMEONE TO WATCH HIM

20:02.619 --> 20:03.954
AROUND THE CLOCK.

20:04.121 --> 20:07.332
YOU CAN'T MAKE A SILK
PURSE OUT OF A SOW'S EAR.

20:07.499 --> 20:08.834
LT'D BE A WASTE
OF TIME TO TRY.

20:09.001 --> 20:09.960
YES.

20:10.127 --> 20:12.170
IS THAT YOUR ANSWER?

20:12.337 --> 20:14.089
A CHANCE TO HELP
A FELLOW HUMAN BEING,

20:14.256 --> 20:15.757
AND YOU CALL IT A WASTE?

20:19.678 --> 20:21.680
YOU HEARD YOUR WIFE,
INGALLS.

20:21.847 --> 20:22.973
WHAT ABOUT IT?

20:34.860 --> 20:36.111
I'LL GIVE IT A TRY.

20:37.863 --> 20:38.906
IT'S VERY GOOD OF YOUR
FATHER TO LET YOU

20:39.072 --> 20:40.991
COME AND STAY WITH US
FOR A WHILE.

20:42.326 --> 20:43.869
I KNOW YOU MISS HIM.

20:47.539 --> 20:49.708
BUT IT'S FOR THE BEST.
YOU'LL SEE.

20:53.211 --> 20:56.340
NOW, MR. INGALLS IS
GOING TO STAY WITH HIM,

20:56.506 --> 20:59.301
AND HE'S GOING TO BE
JUST FINE, YOU'LL SEE.

21:06.308 --> 21:08.644
YOU KNOW, YOU'RE DOING
YOUR PART

21:08.810 --> 21:11.730
BY STAYING HERE.

21:11.897 --> 21:13.023
AS LONG AS YOU DON'T
GIVE YOUR PA

21:13.190 --> 21:14.650
ANY CAUSE FOR WORRY.

21:19.988 --> 21:21.031
NOW, HOW WOULD HE
FEEL IF HE KNEW

21:21.198 --> 21:24.159
YOU WEREN'T GONNA
HAVE ANY SUPPER?

21:24.326 --> 21:25.577
HE WOULDN'T KNOW.

21:25.744 --> 21:27.663
HE'S ALWAYS DRUNK
BY SUPPERTIME.

21:31.917 --> 21:33.335

21:33.502 --> 21:35.420
SHALL I TAKE THEM
OUT OF THE OVEN?

21:35.587 --> 21:36.672
YES.

21:47.182 --> 21:48.266
MM, I COULD
EAT IT ALL.

21:48.433 --> 21:50.185

22:55.333 --> 22:56.835
LET'S GET A FEW
THINGS STRAIGHT.

22:58.545 --> 22:59.713
THE ONLY REASON
I'M HERE IS BECAUSE

22:59.880 --> 23:01.089
MY WIFE THINKS THERE'S
SOMETHING DECENT

23:01.256 --> 23:02.591
IN EVERY MAN, EVEN YOU.

23:05.635 --> 23:06.762
I WANT TO BE
WITH MY FAMILY.

GONNA BE TOGETHER,

23:09.014 --> 23:10.432
YOU'RE GONNA DO
WHAT I SAY.

23:14.186 --> 23:16.313
NOW, PUT THE REST OF
THE WHISKEY ON THE TABLE.

27:01.997 --> 27:03.581
GIVE US A GEOGRAPHY
TEST TODAY.

27:03.748 --> 27:05.583
Mary: YOU DID YOUR HOMEWORK.
I SAW YOU.

27:05.750 --> 27:07.085
BUT THAT WAS
FOR YESTERDAY.

27:07.252 --> 27:09.337
YOU SHOULDN'T SPEND SO MUCH
TIME READING TENNYSON.

27:09.504 --> 27:11.589
BUT I LIKE TENNYSON.

27:11.756 --> 27:15.176
MAYBE YOU CAN GET HIM
TO TAKE YOUR GEOGRAPHY TEST.

27:15.343 --> 27:16.428

FOR YOU, GRAHAM.

27:36.114 --> 27:38.700
I NEVER TAKE LUNCH
TO SCHOOL.

27:38.867 --> 27:39.993

27:40.160 --> 27:41.286
I DON'T
WANT IT DIFFERENT.

WE WON'T
TELL ANYBODY.

AND WHEN
LUNCHTIME COMES,

YOU CAN PRETEND YOU'RE
SHARING WITH HIM.

OUTSIDE A FEW MINUTES AGO.

ANYBODY TO KNOW.

ANYTHING.

32:54.974 --> 32:56.851
KNOW WHAT?
WHAT IS THIS?

32:57.018 --> 33:00.063

OUT THE STALLS IN THE BARN

33:00.229 --> 33:01.481

FOR MY CHICKEN?

33:39.018 --> 33:40.311

I TAKE HIM HOME.

GET AWAY.

35:43.267 --> 35:44.560
LET'S TAKE
A LOOK AROUND.

35:47.230 --> 35:48.356
TAKE A GOOD LOOK.

35:50.066 --> 35:52.109
YEAH, IT LOOKS
SOMETHING BETTER.

35:52.276 --> 35:53.486
AN IMPROVEMENT
EVERY DAY.

35:53.653 --> 35:55.404

BUILD A NEW DOOR.

35:55.571 --> 35:58.282
THAT'S GOOD. AN EASY
DAY FOR A CHANGE.

35:58.449 --> 36:00.451
NO, I SAID I'M
GONNA BUILD A DOOR.

36:00.618 --> 36:02.995
YOU'RE GONNA START A
CORNFIELD RIGHT OVER THERE.

36:03.162 --> 36:04.080

NOTICED THE PLOW

36:04.247 --> 36:05.706

OF THE WAGON?

36:09.126 --> 36:10.503
I'M NEVER GONNA
MAKE IT.

36:12.630 --> 36:13.923
SURE YOU WILL.

36:14.090 --> 36:18.219

SOUP, SOME CORNBREAD.

JOB, GRAHAM.

36:30.314 --> 36:32.191

36:32.358 --> 36:34.735

36:34.902 --> 36:38.614
I THINK SO, BUT IT
STILL NEEDS A TOP.

36:38.781 --> 36:40.074

36:42.660 --> 36:44.161

WHEN YOU GO, GRAHAM.

37:02.013 --> 37:04.140
WHEN WILL THAT BE?

37:04.307 --> 37:06.183
I DON'T KNOW.

37:06.350 --> 37:07.518
HAS PA STOPPED DRINKING?

37:07.685 --> 37:08.936
OH, I'M SURE HE HAS.

37:12.023 --> 37:13.524
DOES HE ALWAYS GET MAD
AT YOU WHEN HE DRINKS?

37:13.691 --> 37:14.775
MOSTLY.

37:17.361 --> 37:20.114
MARY TOLD ME IT WAS
BECAUSE OF YOUR MOTHER.

37:20.281 --> 37:22.700
HER NAME WAS LUCY.

37:22.867 --> 37:23.993
LUCY?

37:26.454 --> 37:27.872
THAT'S A PRETTY NAME.

37:28.039 --> 37:31.000
PA SAYS IT SOMETIMES
WHEN HE'S BEEN DRINKING.

37:31.167 --> 37:33.461
BUT THAT'S THE ONLY TIME
HE EVER TALKS ABOUT HER.

37:35.880 --> 37:37.256
I KNEW SHE HAD DIED.

37:39.258 --> 37:42.011
WHEN I GOT BORN.

37:42.178 --> 37:45.264
THOSE THINGS HAPPEN
SOMETIMES, GRAHAM.

37:45.431 --> 37:47.808
PA MUST MISS HER
SOMETHING TERRIBLE,

37:47.975 --> 37:51.395
JUST LIKE YOU MISS
MR. INGALLS.

37:51.562 --> 37:54.565
WHEN HE GETS DRUNK,
IT MAKES HIM MAD.

37:54.732 --> 37:56.400
AT YOU?

37:56.567 --> 37:57.860
YES.

37:58.027 --> 37:59.862
BUT ONLY WHEN HE'S DRUNK.

38:00.029 --> 38:01.447
AND HE NEVER REMEMBERS.

38:07.745 --> 38:09.205
WHAT HAPPENED
TO YOUR MOTHER,

38:09.372 --> 38:12.249
YOU MUSTN'T BLAME YOURSELF
FOR THAT, GRAHAM.

38:12.416 --> 38:14.043
I DON'T. PA DOES.

38:21.217 --> 38:22.426
DON'T BE TOO LONG.

38:36.732 --> 38:38.109

HARDLY COOK ENOUGH FOOD

39:01.382 --> 39:03.217
WHAT BRINGS YOU
OUT HERE?

39:03.384 --> 39:04.677
MY USUAL ROUNDS.

39:07.013 --> 39:10.016
WELL, THAT'S FUNNY.

39:10.182 --> 39:11.976
I DON'T RECALL
YOU EVER PAYING

39:12.143 --> 39:13.936
A SOCIAL CALL ON ME
BEFORE.

39:16.981 --> 39:18.399
WHEN I STOPPED BY
TO SEE THE INGALLS,

39:18.566 --> 39:23.237
CAROLINE AND THE GIRLS ASKED
ME TO SAY HELLO TO CHARLES.

39:23.404 --> 39:26.032
OH.

39:26.198 --> 39:28.492
I SAW GRAHAM.

39:28.659 --> 39:30.536
HE'S DOING VERY WELL.

39:30.703 --> 39:31.871
OF COURSE, HE MISSES YOU.

39:34.081 --> 39:35.207
OH, SURE HE DOES.

39:39.336 --> 39:41.589
NICE YOU COULD FIND TIME
TO STOP BY.

39:55.811 --> 39:58.230
THANKS FOR STOPPING BY,
REVEREND.

39:58.397 --> 40:01.901
CAROLINE AND I BOTH THOUGHT
IT COULD BE VERY IMPORTANT.

40:02.068 --> 40:04.820
I AGREE.

40:04.987 --> 40:06.781
I'LL KNOW SOON ENOUGH
IF HE BLAMES THE BOY.

40:09.617 --> 40:11.118
CHARLES, TRY TO
GO EASY WITH HIM.

40:13.704 --> 40:15.039
I'LL DO WHAT I HAVE
TO DO, REVEREND.

40:19.710 --> 40:20.795
YOU TAKE CARE.

40:31.722 --> 40:34.517
WELL, THE HOLIER-
THAN-THOUS

40:34.683 --> 40:36.852
JUST COULDN'T WAIT TO
SEND A SNOOP UP AROUND

40:37.019 --> 40:39.063
TO SEE
IF I WAS SUFFERING

40:39.230 --> 40:41.732
LIKE I OUGHT TO BE,
COULD THEY?

40:41.899 --> 40:43.692
COME ON. REVEREND ALDEN
WASN'T SNOOPING.

40:43.859 --> 40:46.987
HE WAS BRINGING ME A MESSAGE
FROM MY WIFE, THAT'S ALL.

40:47.154 --> 40:50.950
WELL, AIN'T THAT NICE?

40:51.117 --> 40:52.409
COME ON, YOU GOT A COUPLE
HOURS OF DAYLIGHT LEFT.

40:52.576 --> 40:54.328
GET TO CHOPPING.
WE NEED SOME FIREWOOD.

41:02.378 --> 41:03.546
I SURE MISS MY WIFE.

41:05.589 --> 41:06.799
WHEN'D YOU LOSE YOURS?

41:11.554 --> 41:12.680
A LONG TIME AGO.

41:13.973 --> 41:15.099
WHAT WAS HER NAME?

41:18.811 --> 41:19.937
LUCY.

41:22.606 --> 41:23.816
HOW'D SHE DIE?

41:27.361 --> 41:29.780
WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE?

41:29.947 --> 41:31.323
NONE TO ME.
I JUST WONDERED.

41:35.035 --> 41:36.203
WHAT'D SHE DIE OF?

41:40.040 --> 41:42.751
SHE DIED GMNG BIRTH
TO THE BOY.

41:42.918 --> 41:45.004
I GUESS THAT'S WHY YOU BLAME
HIM FOR HER DEATH, HUH?

41:47.631 --> 41:49.049
THAT'S WHY I WHAT?

41:49.216 --> 41:51.677
YOU HEARD ME. WHY YOU BLAME
YOUR SON FOR YOUR WIFE'S DEATH.

41:56.140 --> 41:57.141
I DON'T BLAME HIM.

41:57.308 --> 41:58.309
OF COURSE YOU BLAME HIM.

41:58.475 --> 42:00.686
YOU TELL HIM THAT
EVERY TIME YOU BEAT HIM.

42:00.853 --> 42:02.771
EVERY TIME YOU'RE DRUNK,
YOU TELL HIM THAT.

42:02.938 --> 42:04.773
YOU TELL HIM HE IS WHY
HIS MOTHER DIED.

42:10.738 --> 42:12.114
THAT'S NOT TRUE.

42:12.281 --> 42:15.993
OF COURSE IT'S TRUE. HE'S
NOT GONNA LIE ABOUT IT.

42:16.160 --> 42:17.494
YOU BLAME HIM,
DON'T YOU?

42:33.177 --> 42:35.137
LEAVE ME ALONE,
WILL YOU?

42:35.304 --> 42:36.472
FINISH CUTTING THAT WOOD,

42:36.639 --> 42:38.182
AND WE'LL FIND SOMETHING ELSE
FOR YOU TO DO.

44:22.328 --> 44:23.329
WELL, YOU'RE JUST
IN TIME.

44:23.495 --> 44:25.664
THAT'S MY HOLD-OUT
BOTTLE.

44:25.831 --> 44:27.499
IT'S THE ONE I DIDN'T
TELL YOU ABOUT.

44:30.627 --> 44:31.670
WELL, I THOUGHT
IT WAS TIME

44:31.837 --> 44:33.464
THAT I FOUND SOMETHING
OUT, AND I DID,

44:33.630 --> 44:34.548
AND IT GAVE ME
SOME PLEASURE

44:34.715 --> 44:37.051
TO POUR IT OUT--
SOME.

44:42.973 --> 44:46.769
YOU KNOW SOMETHING
ELSE, TOO...AHEM.

44:46.935 --> 44:47.853
YOU'RE RIGHT ABOUT
SOMETHING ELSE.

44:48.020 --> 44:48.979
I DID BLAME GRAHAM.

44:49.146 --> 44:50.647
I BLAMED MY SON
FOR MY WIFE'S DEATH.

44:50.814 --> 44:52.941
I DIDN'T REALIZE IT,
BUT I DID. I...

44:57.988 --> 44:59.239
I LOVE MY SON.

45:01.367 --> 45:02.451
I DO.

45:15.005 --> 45:18.050
WELL, COME ON. WHY DON'T
WE GET SOME SLEEP?

45:18.217 --> 45:19.593
I WANT TO GO HOME TOMORROW.

45:28.352 --> 45:30.312
WELL, CHILDREN, WHAT WOULD YOU
LIKE TO DO TODAY?

45:30.479 --> 45:32.564
THAT IS, AFTER YOU FINISH
YOUR CHORES.

45:32.731 --> 45:35.025
YOU MEAN WE DON'T HAVE
TO GO TO SCHOOL?

45:35.192 --> 45:36.693
IT'S SATURDAY,
SILLY.

45:36.860 --> 45:38.028
OH, I FORGOT.

45:38.195 --> 45:40.239
I'D LIKE TO START SEWING
ON MY NEW DRESS, MA.

45:40.406 --> 45:43.033
WELL, ALL RIGHT. THEN PERHAPS
YOU CAN JOIN US LATER.

45:43.200 --> 45:44.368
WHERE?

45:44.535 --> 45:46.286
WELL, I THOUGHT WE MIGHT
HAVE A LITTLE PICNIC

45:46.453 --> 45:50.374
AND GO DOWN TO THE CREEK.
MAYBE TAKE A FISHING LINE.

45:55.462 --> 45:56.630
HOW'S MY GIRLS?

46:13.730 --> 46:15.023
YOUR PA'S OUTSIDE.

46:46.138 --> 46:46.930
COME ON.

46:47.097 --> 46:48.515
OH, WAIT A MINUTE.
