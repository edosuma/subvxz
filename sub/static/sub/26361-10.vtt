00:04.308 --> 00:06.267
- In the criminal justice
system,

00:06.310 --> 00:07.703
sexually based offenses

00:07.746 --> 00:09.792
are considered
especially heinous.

00:09.835 --> 00:12.055
In New York City,
the dedicated detectives

00:12.099 --> 00:13.665
who investigate
these vicious felonies

00:13.709 --> 00:15.319
are members of an elite squad

00:15.363 --> 00:17.234
known as
the Special Victims Unit.

00:17.278 --> 00:20.020
These are their stories.

00:21.151 --> 00:23.414
- His spotted hand
jerked forward,

00:23.458 --> 00:26.374
landing heavy
on the top of my head.

00:26.417 --> 00:31.509
Retreat or resistance
was now futile.

00:31.553 --> 00:34.034
I reminded myself to breathe--

00:34.077 --> 00:37.211
in, out, in, out.

00:37.254 --> 00:39.039
The fumes from a passing truck

00:39.082 --> 00:41.345
crept through the open window
of his Toyota,

00:41.389 --> 00:43.043
snuck into my nostrils

00:43.086 --> 00:45.654
and slithered down my esophagus
like a worm,

00:45.697 --> 00:50.833
taunting the rubber walls
into syncopated contractions.

00:50.876 --> 00:52.835
Push, push,

00:52.878 --> 00:55.446
pull, push.

00:55.490 --> 00:58.101
Now, the calluses
on William's fingers

00:58.145 --> 01:01.061
scratched my thighs
in 20 spots at once.

01:01.104 --> 01:05.282
Now, the stale cigar breath
engulfed my tongue.

01:05.326 --> 01:07.545
Now, his yellow incisors

01:07.589 --> 01:11.201
nipped at my earlobes and neck.

01:11.245 --> 01:13.551
The kraken has
trapped the barracuda

01:13.595 --> 01:17.077
and is toying with it
before the feast.

01:17.120 --> 01:18.600
The dust lifted and rose,

01:18.643 --> 01:21.646
forming a halo above
the deserted parking lot.

01:23.257 --> 01:27.130
And for one
short, illusory moment...

02:14.351 --> 02:15.787
- To read it is one thing.

02:15.831 --> 02:19.182
To hear you read it is--
can I say it--experiential.

will ever go mainstream?

02:27.451 --> 02:28.844

always comes from

02:30.802 --> 02:32.674

Pitch Dark Press.

even tell me about it.

he ran away at 13 years old

How do these readings work?

Do people buy tickets?

first serve.

to see that list.

Bobbi's publisher for that.

05:58.967 --> 06:00.447
Pitch Dark Press.

06:00.490 --> 06:01.796
- Pitch Dark Press.
Okay.

06:01.839 --> 06:03.885
Thank you.

06:08.716 --> 06:10.152

seen him before.

06:10.195 --> 06:12.154
- Well, sure.

06:12.197 --> 06:15.418
But his readers
were fascinated by his story.

06:15.462 --> 06:17.855
They were chomping at the bit
to lay their eyes on him.

06:17.899 --> 06:20.597
- Fascinated by
a child prostitute, huh?

06:20.641 --> 06:23.992
- By a being capable
of living two lives.

06:25.167 --> 06:27.517
He wouldn't even let me put
his picture on the book jacket.

06:31.173 --> 06:34.742
Thomas Pynchon.
J.D. Salinger.

06:34.785 --> 06:38.136
You know, separate the art
from the artist.

06:42.227 --> 06:44.969
This showed up unsolicited.

06:45.013 --> 06:46.623
I read the first page,

06:46.667 --> 06:48.886
and I didn't stop until
I reached page 287.

06:48.930 --> 06:50.584
It was perfect.

06:50.627 --> 06:52.542
The only thing the author
left out was his name,

06:52.586 --> 06:53.891
address, phone number.

06:53.935 --> 06:55.545
- No, no, no.

06:55.589 --> 06:56.894
It was intentional.

06:56.938 --> 06:58.853
I got a call a few days later,

06:58.896 --> 07:01.464
and this timid,
tentative voice

07:01.508 --> 07:03.684
changed my life forever.

07:03.727 --> 07:06.426
The things that
he lived through--

07:06.469 --> 07:09.080
even though that book
got him off the street,

07:09.124 --> 07:12.040
I still drove up 12th Avenue
on the way home

07:12.083 --> 07:15.130
to make sure he wasn't
tricking on some corner.

07:16.610 --> 07:17.915
That's the animal
that killed him?

07:17.959 --> 07:19.439
- Could be.
You know him?

07:19.482 --> 07:21.049
- Never saw him before.

07:21.092 --> 07:22.964
- All right, we're gonna need
a guest list for this reading.

07:23.007 --> 07:25.488
- Sure.

07:25.532 --> 07:26.968
- And Bobbi's address.

07:27.011 --> 07:28.926
- That I can't help you with.

07:30.798 --> 07:32.452
- We didn't.

07:32.495 --> 07:34.889
They're direct deposited
into his account at Metro.

07:34.932 --> 07:36.717
- The kid's a ghost.

07:36.760 --> 07:38.545
Till last night, nobody ever
saw him but his publisher.

07:38.588 --> 07:39.894
- Yeah, the home address
he gave the bank

07:39.937 --> 07:41.765
was the 92nd Street Y.

07:41.809 --> 07:43.245
- And none of them recognize
Bobbi or the guy in the video.

07:43.288 --> 07:45.769
- Guys, so let's--
let's get back to basics here.

07:45.813 --> 07:48.163
Why would somebody
want Bobbi dead?

07:48.206 --> 07:49.773
- It could be money.

07:49.817 --> 07:51.514
He has over half a mil
in his bank account.

07:51.558 --> 07:52.950
- That's a lot of books.

07:52.994 --> 07:54.474
- He sold his rights
to Hollywood.

07:55.953 --> 07:57.259
Another writer gets mad
about his success.

07:57.302 --> 07:59.217
- Well, Norman Mailer

07:59.261 --> 08:00.915
would've killed Gore Vidal
on principle.

08:00.958 --> 08:02.656
- All due respect
to you, Professor,

08:02.699 --> 08:04.222
but I'll go with sex.
I mean,

08:04.266 --> 08:06.747
the kid's fame and fortune
all came from it.

08:06.790 --> 08:08.618
- Hey, so,
I may have something.

08:08.662 --> 08:11.795
Somebody posted Bobbi's reading
at the bookstore online.

08:11.839 --> 08:13.144
It kinda broke my heart.

08:13.188 --> 08:14.624
Look.

08:14.668 --> 08:16.800
- My tongue.

08:16.844 --> 08:18.585
Now, his yellow incisors...

08:18.628 --> 08:21.675
- This is--
this is our guy, right?

08:25.200 --> 08:26.941
And look.

08:29.596 --> 08:32.163
Look what's there on
the floor beside his chair.

08:32.207 --> 08:34.862
- He bought the book,
"Absalom, Absalom!"

08:34.905 --> 08:36.820

a credit card.

08:36.864 --> 08:39.606
His name is William Glover,
and he lives in Forest Hills.

08:45.916 --> 08:47.701

- Just a second.

08:50.660 --> 08:52.532
Do we have to do this here?

08:52.575 --> 08:54.534
- I figured we go back to the
station, sort this all out.

08:54.577 --> 08:56.536

08:56.579 --> 08:58.581

- I love you.

09:14.815 --> 09:16.599

maybe a little loud.

09:21.386 --> 09:23.606

a confession is just

09:25.956 --> 09:27.610

for everybody.

09:27.654 --> 09:29.220

William?

09:32.267 --> 09:34.182

tell us what happened?

09:40.971 --> 09:44.279

- I don't really care.

09:52.026 --> 09:54.724

I have a wife.

09:54.768 --> 09:57.988
I have two beautiful children.
- Okay.

10:05.953 --> 10:08.608

her name was Tammy.

10:10.305 --> 10:12.046

three weeks ago.

10:12.089 --> 10:13.700
I'd pick her up
near the parking lot

10:13.743 --> 10:15.136

10:20.271 --> 10:24.058

unzipping my pants.

10:24.101 --> 10:26.103
Her hair was so soft,

10:26.147 --> 10:27.844
silky,
like a butterfly's wings,

10:27.888 --> 10:31.021
her mouth, warm and wet.

10:31.065 --> 10:32.675
She only wanted $50.

10:32.719 --> 10:34.242
She said 25 went to her boss.

11:23.770 --> 11:27.425
It's all he knows.
He doesn't know how to stop.

11:27.469 --> 11:29.514

Hey, Lieutenant,
that publisher--

11:32.126 --> 11:33.518
he said that he drove up
12th Avenue

11:33.562 --> 11:34.781
looking for Bobbi,
wanted to make sure

11:34.824 --> 11:36.608
he wasn't going back
to his old ways.

11:36.652 --> 11:40.308
Never saw him, but somehow
Glover finds him there,

11:40.351 --> 11:43.790
several times in
the past three weeks?

11:43.833 --> 11:45.748
- You're saying that
the publisher's lying?

11:45.792 --> 11:47.663
- Bobbi was a kid.

11:47.707 --> 11:50.318
He could've been
pimping him out.

11:54.801 --> 11:56.324
- Detective Carisi,

11:56.367 --> 11:57.673
did you find the guy
that killed Bobbi?

11:57.717 --> 11:59.240
We did.

11:59.283 --> 12:01.851
- Oh, that's great.
Um, you want me to testify?

12:01.895 --> 12:04.158
- Well, let's not get ahead
of ourselves here.

12:04.201 --> 12:05.507
I just--
I wanna clarify one thing.

12:05.550 --> 12:07.727
Now, you told me that

12:07.770 --> 12:10.425
you drove up and down 12th
Avenue looking for Bobbi.

12:10.468 --> 12:11.818
- I cared about the kid,
you know?

12:11.861 --> 12:13.689
I wanted to keep him safe.

12:13.733 --> 12:15.299
- I'm sure you did.

12:15.343 --> 12:17.867
The thing is that the guy
who actually killed him

12:17.911 --> 12:21.479
found Bobbi hooking several
times in the past few weeks.

12:21.523 --> 12:23.612
Do you know where he found him?

12:25.745 --> 12:28.443
12th Avenue.

12:28.486 --> 12:30.532
- Okay, so I lied.

12:30.575 --> 12:32.273
I never actually met Bobbi.

12:32.316 --> 12:33.753
- Who was that
at the reading, then?

12:33.796 --> 12:35.363
- Taffy, Teddy, Tammy--

12:35.406 --> 12:36.799
whatever the hell he was
calling himself that week.

12:36.843 --> 12:38.279
- So this whole thing
was a scam?

12:38.322 --> 12:40.324
- No, no, no, no.
Bobbi O'Rourke is real.

12:40.368 --> 12:43.240
The whole secrecy thing
was his idea.

12:43.284 --> 12:45.895
And it worked great until we
sold the rights to Hollywood.

12:45.939 --> 12:49.420
And then these damn producers
insisted he show his face,

12:49.464 --> 12:50.813
only I didn't have
a face to show.

12:50.857 --> 12:52.554
- So you created one.

12:52.597 --> 12:54.599
- I found Tammy on the street,
you know?

12:54.643 --> 12:56.819
I bought a forged license.

12:56.863 --> 12:59.866
All he had to do was just
read a couple of pages.

12:59.909 --> 13:02.216
I paid him $500.
It kept him in oxy.

13:02.259 --> 13:04.479
I didn't think that
anybody would get hurt.

13:04.522 --> 13:07.482
- I guess you were wrong
about that.

13:10.398 --> 13:13.488
- I'll get back to you
on that one.

13:13.531 --> 13:14.837
If it weren't for
this publisher's scam,

13:14.881 --> 13:16.317
this kid would still be alive.

13:16.360 --> 13:17.927
- Okay, well,
you try convincing Stone

13:17.971 --> 13:19.711
that there was causation.

13:19.755 --> 13:21.670
- All right, fine.
We charge him with fraud, then.

13:21.713 --> 13:24.673
- Because he lured people
into a free book reading?

13:24.716 --> 13:26.849
Look, Carisi, I don't
like it any more than you do,

13:26.893 --> 13:29.286
but until we change
the laws in Albany,

13:29.330 --> 13:30.635
there's nothing that we can do.

13:30.679 --> 13:32.376
- You know,
this book is filled with sex

13:32.420 --> 13:34.465
between Bobbi
and scores of adult men,

13:34.509 --> 13:36.554
who all could be charged
with statutory rape.

13:36.598 --> 13:38.861
- Fin, I'm pretty sure Bobbi
didn't use any real names.

13:38.905 --> 13:40.384
- Well, what if
we could find him?

13:40.428 --> 13:42.169
Come on.

13:42.212 --> 13:43.910
There's zero chance that this
kid's gonna show his face now.

13:43.953 --> 13:46.869
- Bobbi made a couple of
online banking transactions,

13:46.913 --> 13:49.916
so I had TARU
track the IP address.

13:53.658 --> 13:54.964
- This is not what I expected.

13:55.008 --> 13:57.837
- He's probably
renting a room.

13:59.360 --> 14:01.536
NYPD.

14:03.407 --> 14:05.540
- Not really.

14:05.583 --> 14:07.585
I tried to get them to come
to a community meeting

14:07.629 --> 14:08.935
about six months ago.

14:08.978 --> 14:11.546
I rang the bell.
Music inside stopped.

14:13.504 --> 14:15.550
- Lights go on at night,
off in the morning.

14:15.593 --> 14:17.204
I see delivery guys
every now and then

14:17.247 --> 14:18.727
leave stuff at the door,

14:18.770 --> 14:20.294
but never actually saw anyone
take anything in.

14:20.337 --> 14:22.339
I know most everyone else
on the block.

14:22.383 --> 14:25.734
I figured it's New York.
People are allowed to be weird.

14:25.777 --> 14:26.735
- They certainly are.

14:26.778 --> 14:27.823
Thank you.

- Ah, a fegulah.

18:04.387 --> 18:05.780
- Uh, yeah,
but I don't think

18:05.823 --> 18:07.260
it's okay
to say that word anymore.

18:08.435 --> 18:10.437

18:10.480 --> 18:12.003
- It's just a word.

18:12.047 --> 18:14.049
- Yeah, but words
can hurt more than a gun.

18:34.417 --> 18:37.159

tell us what happened
to Bobbi O'Rourke.

22:36.529 --> 22:38.618
Do you understand that?

23:00.335 --> 23:05.471
♪

23:05.514 --> 23:07.560
Jeez.

23:31.627 --> 23:33.455
- Lab results are back.

23:33.499 --> 23:36.153
DNA on the manuscript
matches the laptop

23:36.197 --> 23:37.720
and the blood on the floor.

23:37.764 --> 23:40.027
- Well, there we go.

23:40.070 --> 23:41.681
We're gonna search your house

23:41.724 --> 23:44.292
from top to bottom,
and we're gonna find him.

23:44.335 --> 23:46.381
Who?
- That's it.

23:46.425 --> 23:47.643
You both are under arrest.

23:47.687 --> 23:49.384
Put them in the cage.
- Wait.

23:49.428 --> 23:51.473
It was me.

23:55.434 --> 23:57.131
- There is no Bobbi.

23:58.480 --> 24:00.787
- Okay, give them a lawyer
if they want one--I'm done.

24:00.830 --> 24:03.093
- Wait!

24:03.137 --> 24:05.444
The book--

24:05.487 --> 24:07.707
I wrote it.

24:07.750 --> 24:08.751
You wrote a book?

24:08.795 --> 24:11.493
- I had to do something.

24:11.537 --> 24:13.843
Who do you think
pays for the groceries?

24:13.887 --> 24:16.150
The real estate taxes?
- Ahh, he's a meshuga.

24:16.193 --> 24:17.499
- Not you.
- He's a meshuga.

24:17.543 --> 24:19.196
It's Mama's money
that pays for--

24:19.240 --> 24:21.416
- Mama's money is gonna
run out in six months.

24:21.460 --> 24:23.549
You don't think
about the future.

24:23.592 --> 24:25.768
I think about it.
I think about everything.

24:25.812 --> 24:28.641
- Wait a minute.

24:28.684 --> 24:30.207
If you haven't left the house

24:30.251 --> 24:32.862
since 1973,

24:32.906 --> 24:35.430
how was it that you got
a computer to write on?

24:35.474 --> 24:36.779
You got a computer?

24:36.823 --> 24:39.826
- No, I drew hieroglyphics
on the crapper wall.

24:39.869 --> 24:41.175
- Ben.

24:41.218 --> 24:42.611
Focus.

24:44.308 --> 24:46.267
- I gave Carlos,

24:46.310 --> 24:48.182
the kid who delivers
from the Deli,

24:48.225 --> 24:52.447
100 bucks to buy it and set
the whole fercockt thing up.

24:52.491 --> 24:54.231
- Ben,

24:54.275 --> 24:56.669
so tell me about
the blood on the floor.

24:56.712 --> 24:59.585
- I cut myself
when I tried to carry

24:59.628 --> 25:02.501
Mama's sewing machine
into the basement.

25:02.544 --> 25:04.546
Like you would help.

25:04.590 --> 25:06.722
I stepped on
a piece of broken glass.

25:06.766 --> 25:09.682
You could test my blood
if you want.

25:09.725 --> 25:13.816
Why do you think Bobbi
never showed his face?

25:16.253 --> 25:18.778
The bartender from
Molly Malone's--

25:18.821 --> 25:20.431
that, you remember.

25:20.475 --> 25:23.609
That's where
I got my hero's name.

25:24.958 --> 25:27.482
The truth is,

25:27.526 --> 25:29.789
we didn't kill Bobbi O'Rourke.

25:29.832 --> 25:32.487
You people did.

26:08.523 --> 26:08.697
.

26:08.741 --> 26:11.526
- The M.E.'s office finally
got Rose Edelman thawed.

26:11.570 --> 26:14.094
She had malignant tumors
in both lungs.

26:14.137 --> 26:15.530
- That's a painful way to die.

26:15.574 --> 26:16.705
- Only cancer
isn't what killed her.

26:16.749 --> 26:17.924
It was asphyxiation.

26:19.621 --> 26:21.014
- There was no bruising
on the neck.

26:21.057 --> 26:23.016
The M.E. thinks that
they must have used a pillow,

26:23.059 --> 26:24.452
put it over her nose
and her mouth.

26:24.495 --> 26:25.888
I mean,
she could barely breathe.

26:25.932 --> 26:28.630
It wouldn't have
taken much effort.

26:31.111 --> 26:34.201
- Enough to get the
general flavor, yeah.

26:38.858 --> 26:40.686
- "At once,

26:40.729 --> 26:43.123
"I felt pitiful and small,

26:43.166 --> 26:46.735
"struck with wonder
and sickened that this man,

26:46.779 --> 26:48.519
"20 years my senior,

26:48.563 --> 26:51.871
"could find enough pleasure
in my 12-year-old body

26:51.914 --> 26:55.831
"to turn over $50
of his hard-earned pay.

26:55.875 --> 26:59.139
"What was he feeling?
What was he thinking?

26:59.182 --> 27:01.532
"Did he love me or hate me?

27:01.576 --> 27:03.796
Did I love or hate him?"

27:07.147 --> 27:09.932
Amanda, I can't tell you
how many times in my career

27:09.976 --> 27:12.631
I've heard the exact same thing

27:12.674 --> 27:15.242
from survivors of
childhood sexual abuse.

27:15.285 --> 27:17.592
- Only that's coming from
a 73-year-old hoarder--

27:17.636 --> 27:21.640
- Who's completely rejected
and alienated society.

27:24.686 --> 27:27.646
- If he was,

27:27.689 --> 27:30.518
I think he deserves closure.

27:30.561 --> 27:31.824
- I'm coming with you.

27:33.216 --> 27:36.655
Come on, there were
two kids in that house.

27:36.698 --> 27:39.266
That damn desk
is driving me crazy, Liv.

27:44.532 --> 27:46.055
- Once, out at Atlantic Beach,

27:46.099 --> 27:48.231
Joe and I--

27:48.275 --> 27:51.974
I was probably 10.
He would've been 12--

27:52.018 --> 27:55.151
We were riding the waves

27:55.195 --> 27:57.980
it seemed like for hours.

27:58.024 --> 28:00.983
Mama was on the beach,
reading her book.

28:01.027 --> 28:02.768
She loved books.

28:02.811 --> 28:05.292
- Well, maybe that's
where you got your talent.

28:07.990 --> 28:11.254
We'd swim out to where
the waves broke

28:11.298 --> 28:13.822
and then ride them in

28:13.866 --> 28:16.825
to see who could
come closest to shore,

28:16.869 --> 28:20.263
over and over again until

28:20.307 --> 28:23.614
there were no waves anymore.

28:23.658 --> 28:27.531
We tried to swim in,
but the undertow--

28:27.575 --> 28:29.533
No matter how hard we tried,

28:29.577 --> 28:31.710
we just ended up
getting further

28:31.753 --> 28:33.320
and further from the shore.

28:33.363 --> 28:36.627
We thought we were gonna die,
Joe and I.

28:36.671 --> 28:40.066
He put his arms around me.

28:40.109 --> 28:43.330
And then suddenly,
the lifeguard saw us,

28:43.373 --> 28:45.985
blew his whistle,
stood up out of his chair,

28:46.028 --> 28:47.856
and swam out toward us.

28:47.900 --> 28:51.773
And the next thing I knew,
I was face down on the beach,

28:51.817 --> 28:55.298
regurgitating salt water
with every cough.

28:55.342 --> 28:58.040
- Well, you certainly
owe that lifeguard.

28:58.084 --> 29:01.217
- No, no.
I owe Mama.

29:01.261 --> 29:03.742
She beat the lifeguard
out to us

29:03.785 --> 29:06.048
and kept us afloat
until he got there.

29:08.007 --> 29:11.314
- She sounds like
an amazing woman.

29:15.275 --> 29:18.365
- The eggs always think they're
smarter than the chicken.

29:20.933 --> 29:23.979
I'm not about to confess
to something I didn't do,

29:24.023 --> 29:25.676
Lieutenant.

29:29.724 --> 29:31.987
- What about something
that your brother did?

29:32.031 --> 29:34.990
- Well, I really don't know.
You have to ask him.

29:38.951 --> 29:41.127
- In a manner of speaking.

29:41.170 --> 29:43.085
It's either yes or no.

29:43.129 --> 29:45.174
- No, but, um,

29:45.218 --> 29:48.395
but there is someone...
special.

29:49.875 --> 29:51.398
- Yeah, well,
until he marries you,

29:51.441 --> 29:53.704
I don't want to hear from it.

29:53.748 --> 29:56.272
Joe, I'll--I'll keep you
up to date

29:56.316 --> 29:58.100
- Mm.

30:00.842 --> 30:02.104
You never wanted a wife?

30:02.148 --> 30:04.150
No.

30:04.193 --> 30:06.065
I'm too busy.

30:06.108 --> 30:09.633
"Too busy," okay.

30:09.677 --> 30:12.375
'Cause you're pretty
handsome.

30:12.419 --> 30:15.378
You would've been quite a catch
for some lucky girl.

30:17.685 --> 30:21.384
- So, what, are you shacking up
like those, uh, flower people?

30:21.428 --> 30:23.212
Yeah, I'm shack--

30:23.256 --> 30:25.345
Flower pe--I think
it's "flower children,"

30:25.388 --> 30:27.956
and  they've been--
they've been gone a long time.

30:28.000 --> 30:30.698
- Huh.

30:30.741 --> 30:32.831
Has he confessed yet?

30:32.874 --> 30:34.136
- Mm.

30:34.180 --> 30:36.008
Who else?

30:36.051 --> 30:38.140
He's weak, that kid.

30:41.927 --> 30:43.189
- He needs you
to protect him?

30:43.232 --> 30:45.147
- You're damn straight.

30:45.191 --> 30:48.237
And sometimes...

30:52.807 --> 30:55.854
- Sometimes it's really hard
being the bigger brother.

31:01.207 --> 31:03.818
- Well, actually, Ben, I...

31:05.298 --> 31:08.997
I didn't come here
to talk about your mother.

31:10.520 --> 31:14.220
- I wanna talk about your book.

31:14.263 --> 31:16.352
It was, uh,

31:16.396 --> 31:18.267
it was powerful.

31:18.311 --> 31:20.922
- I did.

31:20.966 --> 31:24.708
And it was, um,

31:24.752 --> 31:27.189
so real.

31:27.233 --> 31:30.845
And actually, I...

31:30.889 --> 31:34.240
I don't understand
how you could've written it

31:34.283 --> 31:36.720
without...

31:36.764 --> 31:38.897
- Oh, I, uh,

31:38.940 --> 31:42.248
I don't wanna talk about that.

31:42.291 --> 31:45.512
- I know how hard
it must have been.

31:45.555 --> 31:48.254
You know bubkes.

31:50.778 --> 31:52.388
- No, Ben.

31:52.432 --> 31:54.913
I know that anyone

31:54.956 --> 31:58.917
who could've written a book
like "Blue Barracuda"

31:58.960 --> 32:02.442
certainly must have
lived through something.

32:03.965 --> 32:05.967
You wrote that book

32:06.011 --> 32:08.535
so you could tell the world

32:08.578 --> 32:11.103
how devastating,
how horrifying it was.

32:11.146 --> 32:13.757
- I wrote that book because
we needed the money.

32:13.801 --> 32:15.934
- You were ashamed.

32:15.977 --> 32:19.024
That's why you didn't use
your real name on the book.

32:19.067 --> 32:22.288
I could only imagine
what you must have felt--

32:22.331 --> 32:25.987
hate, rage, disgust.

32:26.901 --> 32:29.425
But shame--

32:29.469 --> 32:31.993
shame isn't on you, Ben.

32:32.037 --> 32:35.562
This wasn't your fault.

32:35.605 --> 32:39.044
Who did this to you?
Who hurt you?

32:40.088 --> 32:43.135
- After school, we used
to go to this play center.

32:44.527 --> 32:47.313
There was a counselor there,
Vincent.

32:47.356 --> 32:50.098
He was about 20.

32:50.142 --> 32:52.883
Taught me
how to pick up grounders.

32:54.537 --> 32:56.235
- No, I wouldn't let him.

32:56.278 --> 32:59.151
What kind of a brother
would I be?

33:01.936 --> 33:05.070
- I was only 12 years old,
damn it.

33:05.113 --> 33:07.159
What kind of a person...

33:11.859 --> 33:15.471
- There was a guy
called Vincent.

33:15.515 --> 33:19.171
The guy was always around.

33:19.214 --> 33:22.043
And, um,

33:22.087 --> 33:24.306
the first time

33:24.350 --> 33:28.006
was in the locker room
when nobody else was there.

33:29.398 --> 33:32.836
He said, uh,

33:32.880 --> 33:36.492
"This is what big boys do."

33:39.278 --> 33:41.889
- Don't tell him.
Don't tell my brother.

33:44.065 --> 33:46.154
- Did you ever
tell anyone, Ben?

33:49.331 --> 33:51.507
- Your brother.
- Oh!

33:51.551 --> 33:53.466
He would've laughed at me.

33:53.509 --> 33:55.250
- I mean,
I was the older brother.

33:55.294 --> 33:58.340
I was supposed to protect him.
How could I tell him about...

34:06.174 --> 34:08.872
- Ah, he'd get mad at me if
I didn't get an A on a test.

34:08.916 --> 34:11.440
He would always say,
"It's your fault."

34:16.967 --> 34:18.969
- Of course not.

34:22.234 --> 34:26.238
- She would've thought
I was dirty.

34:26.281 --> 34:29.371
She wouldn't have
loved me anymore.

34:39.642 --> 34:39.860
.

34:39.903 --> 34:42.384
- They were both
abused as kids, Peter.

34:42.428 --> 34:43.951
- And conveniently,
they didn't say anything

34:43.994 --> 34:45.474
until they were charged
with murdering their mother.

34:45.518 --> 34:47.128
- I believe them.

34:47.172 --> 34:48.695
- And I'll do my best to
get it excluded at trial.

34:48.738 --> 34:50.305
- Look, you won't have to.
Neither of them will admit it.

34:50.349 --> 34:51.915
They won't even
admit it to each other.

34:51.959 --> 34:53.830
- So that's that, then.
- Look, the M.E.'s report

34:53.874 --> 34:57.921
said that Rose's cancer
cost her intolerable pain.

34:57.965 --> 35:00.402
- You and I both know that
that doesn't matter.

35:00.446 --> 35:01.751
- Cut them a deal.

35:01.795 --> 35:03.492
- I worked one out
with their attorney.

35:03.536 --> 35:07.496
One year jail time.
Ten years probation.

35:07.540 --> 35:09.455
- Well, that's generous.

35:09.498 --> 35:10.978
- They turned it down.

35:13.328 --> 35:15.635
- Look, they are
sympathetic defendants.

35:15.678 --> 35:18.551
- Until the jury hears that
they kept Mom's body on ice

35:18.594 --> 35:20.335
in the basement.

35:27.212 --> 35:30.954
- When push comes to shove,
this is a trial about love,

35:30.998 --> 35:33.957
the love of two boys
for their mother.

35:34.001 --> 35:35.829
You know,
it always struck me as odd.

35:35.872 --> 35:37.700
The law says that

35:37.744 --> 35:40.529
a mother has to take care
of her kids when they're young.

35:40.573 --> 35:42.879
You would think there
would be a law that says

35:42.923 --> 35:46.187
they have to take care of her
when she gets old...

35:46.231 --> 35:48.320
or sick.

35:48.363 --> 35:50.887
Rose Edelman got sick,
very sick.

35:50.931 --> 35:53.716
Her doctor said that
she had six months to live.

35:53.760 --> 35:55.892
And then she died.

35:55.936 --> 35:58.504
Now, Mr. Stone will
stand here and tell you

35:58.547 --> 36:00.723
that her two sons
murdered her--

36:00.767 --> 36:02.899
her two loving sons,

36:02.943 --> 36:06.338
the boys who cooked for her,
bathed her,

36:06.381 --> 36:08.601
made sure that
she took her medicine.

36:08.644 --> 36:11.778
The boys who loved her so much
that when she passed,

36:11.821 --> 36:13.432
they couldn't bear
to see her buried

36:13.475 --> 36:15.738
in 6 feet of dirt
out in Queens,

36:15.782 --> 36:17.740
an entrée for hungry worms--

36:17.784 --> 36:19.481
or worse yet,

36:19.525 --> 36:22.049
shoved into a flaming hot oven,

36:22.092 --> 36:25.008
with what's left of her
kept in a jar on a mantel

36:25.052 --> 36:27.054
in a living room.

36:27.097 --> 36:30.013
Joe and Ben loved their mother
Rose so much,

36:30.057 --> 36:32.407
they kept her as she was

36:32.451 --> 36:36.063
and where she wanted to be:
in her home.

36:38.108 --> 36:41.329
If you ask me, that's love.

36:49.424 --> 36:51.383
- Call your first witness,
Mr. Stone.

36:52.993 --> 36:55.038
- No.

36:55.082 --> 36:56.431
No, that's enough.

36:56.475 --> 36:58.303
- Mr. Edelman--
- No, Judge.

36:58.346 --> 36:59.913
- Mr. Edelman, sit down.

36:59.956 --> 37:02.742
- No.
No, Judge.

37:05.005 --> 37:08.008
I did it.

37:08.051 --> 37:10.837
I killed my mother.

37:10.880 --> 37:13.927
I did it.

37:13.970 --> 37:16.669
Ben had nothing
to do with this.

37:16.712 --> 37:18.497
I did it,

37:18.540 --> 37:20.716
and I'm sorry.

37:20.760 --> 37:22.979
I'm so sorry, Mama.

37:23.023 --> 37:25.678
So ve--
Ohh--

37:29.769 --> 37:32.075
- I need an ambulance.
Part 29, Supreme Court.

37:32.119 --> 37:33.468
Here.

37:33.512 --> 37:35.992
Hey, hold him--hold him up.

37:41.650 --> 37:44.610
- You stupid son of a bitch!

37:44.653 --> 37:47.961
Always the martyr.
Look what you did.

37:48.004 --> 37:49.745
You shmuck!

37:49.789 --> 37:51.094
- Massive coronary.

37:51.138 --> 37:52.618
- So stupid.

37:52.661 --> 37:54.359
So stupid.

37:54.402 --> 37:58.537
You're so stupid,
always hogging the stage.

37:58.580 --> 38:00.365
Stupid...

38:00.408 --> 38:02.889
Stupid...

38:02.932 --> 38:05.892
- Okay, Ben, your brother's
still protecting you, huh?

38:05.935 --> 38:08.851
- But what do I have
left to protect?

38:08.895 --> 38:11.506
Nothing.

38:14.901 --> 38:15.945
What?

38:15.989 --> 38:17.382
- Doctor.
- Out.

38:17.425 --> 38:18.948
- Okay, come on.

38:18.992 --> 38:20.428
Give them some room
to do their job.

38:20.472 --> 38:21.951
What's happening?

38:21.995 --> 38:23.953
Let me know.
I wanna know what's happening.

38:23.997 --> 38:25.607
- Let them do their job.

38:25.651 --> 38:26.956
Let's give them some room.

38:27.000 --> 38:29.959
- Let's give them
some room, okay?

38:48.195 --> 38:50.893
- I'm sorry.

38:50.937 --> 38:53.113
- Can I...
- Sure.

38:55.855 --> 38:57.770
- I'll go officially drop
the charges against Ben.

38:57.813 --> 38:59.119
- Okay.

39:02.035 --> 39:03.776
- Thank you.

39:03.819 --> 39:06.648
- Well,
his name was Vincent

39:06.692 --> 39:09.956
from the Center.

39:09.999 --> 39:12.959
I know
I should have told you...

39:14.569 --> 39:16.789
But I just didn't
have the strength.

39:19.226 --> 39:22.577
But I--I remember it
as if it was today,

39:22.621 --> 39:25.101
the way his spotted hand

39:25.145 --> 39:27.060
sorta jerked forward

39:27.103 --> 39:31.456
and landed so heavily
on top of my head.

39:33.719 --> 39:36.809
Retreat or...

39:36.852 --> 39:39.942
resistance was futile.

39:41.553 --> 39:44.207
I just reminded myself

39:44.251 --> 39:47.123
to breathe.

39:47.167 --> 39:50.910
In, out,

39:50.953 --> 39:54.957
in, out.

39:58.004 --> 40:05.098
♪

40:43.658 --> 40:43.876
