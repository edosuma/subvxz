WEBVTT

00:06.048 --> 00:07.383
What on Earth...?

00:14.432 --> 00:15.641
Hello?

00:16.267 --> 00:17.977
- Hello, Mom.
- Hi.

00:18.060 --> 00:20.312
- I bet you're wondering.
- I sure am.

00:20.396 --> 00:21.605
It's a shortwave radio.

00:21.689 --> 00:23.399
Dr. Sturgis is letting me use it.

00:23.482 --> 00:26.110
It picks up broadcasts
from around the world.

00:26.193 --> 00:27.278
Listen.

00:27.361 --> 00:30.948
This is the time being announced
every minute from Ottawa.

00:31.032 --> 00:32.283
<i>At the sound of the tone,</i>

00:32.366 --> 00:34.535
<i>the local time in Ottawa
will be 5:13.</i>

00:35.911 --> 00:37.496
Spellbinding, ain't it?

00:37.580 --> 00:40.416
And you thought this was okay
to go on in my house?

00:40.499 --> 00:42.668
It was that or my house,
so here we are.

00:42.752 --> 00:44.837
Wednesday morning,
the Nobel Prize winners are going

00:44.920 --> 00:47.840
to be announced in Sweden,
and we'll hear it as it's happening.

00:47.923 --> 00:50.718
Well, 2.8 milliseconds later.

00:50.801 --> 00:52.094
Sure, because
of the propagation.

00:52.178 --> 00:54.680
And what's this?
Some kind of antenna?

00:54.764 --> 00:56.974
Yes. It needs to go
up on the roof.

00:57.058 --> 00:58.768
You're not going on the roof.

00:58.851 --> 01:01.187
Of course he's not. I am.

01:01.270 --> 01:02.438
You're not going, either.

01:02.521 --> 01:05.483
Excuse me, I have six years

01:05.566 --> 01:07.068
of tai chi under my belt.

01:07.151 --> 01:09.320
I have the balance
of a jungle cat.

01:09.403 --> 01:12.615
You doing some kind of
slow-motion hula dance

01:12.698 --> 01:15.242
in the park is not gonna
change my mind.

01:15.326 --> 01:19.205
I do much more than just this.

01:20.956 --> 01:23.834
<i>♪ Nobody else
is stronger than I am ♪</i>

01:23.918 --> 01:26.670
<i>♪ Yesterday I moved a mountain ♪</i>

01:26.754 --> 01:29.256
<i>♪ I bet I could be your hero ♪</i>

01:29.340 --> 01:31.592
<i>♪ I am a mighty little man ♪</i>

01:31.675 --> 01:35.805
<i>♪ I am a mighty little man ♪</i>

01:43.604 --> 01:46.107
So you want me to put
that thing on that roof?

01:46.482 --> 01:47.483
Yes.

01:47.566 --> 01:49.610
So you can hear who won
a science prize?

01:49.693 --> 01:51.028
The Nobel Prize.

01:51.112 --> 01:53.489
Why can't you just read
who won in the newspaper?

01:53.572 --> 01:55.383
I could say the same thing
about the Super Bowl,

01:55.407 --> 01:56.575
but you still watch it.

01:56.659 --> 01:57.910
He got you there.

01:58.577 --> 01:59.954
The Super Bowl is football.

02:00.037 --> 02:03.290
Your thing is... I don't
even know what your thing is.

02:03.374 --> 02:06.168
It's the most prestigious award
in the field of physics.

02:07.545 --> 02:08.838
I'll think about it.

02:08.920 --> 02:12.633
When I win one, I might
just thank you in my speech.

02:15.469 --> 02:17.054
The things I do for you.

02:20.850 --> 02:22.434
Georgie, get out here!

02:22.518 --> 02:24.061
Got a chore for you!

02:24.145 --> 02:26.939
Good call.
You have no business up there.

02:33.863 --> 02:35.865
<i>Radio Sweden International.</i>

02:35.948 --> 02:36.949
There it is.

02:37.032 --> 02:39.910
Excellent. Which scientists
are you rooting for?

02:39.994 --> 02:41.662
Oh, I don't
have a favorite.

02:41.745 --> 02:44.373
There's so much good
work being done.

02:44.456 --> 02:46.167
I think it's time
Frederick Reines

02:46.250 --> 02:48.502
finally gets his due
for the neutrino.

02:48.586 --> 02:50.504
I suppose he has a shot.

02:50.588 --> 02:53.007
I should think so. He confirmed
the neutrino's existence

02:53.090 --> 02:54.341
35 years ago.

02:54.425 --> 02:56.385
What the heck
are they waiting for?

02:57.344 --> 03:00.723
Lots of talented people
don't get recognized.

03:04.435 --> 03:06.020
<i>Giraffes aren't able to have...</i>

03:08.105 --> 03:10.208
You know if we had cable,
we'd have, like, 60 channels?

03:10.232 --> 03:12.401
We have plenty of channels.

03:12.484 --> 03:13.736
We have seven.

03:13.819 --> 03:15.946
Hey! There are starving kids
in Africa

03:16.030 --> 03:17.323
with no channels.

03:17.406 --> 03:19.325
Come on, it don't cost much.

03:19.408 --> 03:21.035
I'm not paying for television.

03:21.118 --> 03:24.747
Television is free.
Always was, always will be.

03:24.830 --> 03:26.165
You're so cheap.

03:27.166 --> 03:29.543
If you want cable,
pay for it yourself.

03:29.627 --> 03:33.130
Or better yet, try turning that
thing off and go read a book.

03:33.214 --> 03:34.548
"Read a book"?

03:35.716 --> 03:38.677

- John?

03:49.021 --> 03:50.439
Hello, my sweet.

03:50.522 --> 03:52.107
What are you doing out here?

03:52.191 --> 03:54.526
Weeding. You have goosegrass.

03:54.610 --> 03:57.571
And you can't have a nice lawn
if you have goosegrass.

03:58.280 --> 04:00.574
It's kind of dark out.

04:00.658 --> 04:02.368
Goosegrass doesn't sleep.

04:02.451 --> 04:04.161
It kills the good grass

04:04.245 --> 04:05.412
and leaves
bald spots.

04:05.496 --> 04:06.747
But don't worry,

04:06.830 --> 04:09.333
I'm on the job.

04:09.416 --> 04:12.878
Oh. Okay.

04:13.504 --> 04:15.130
Can I get you a flashlight?

04:15.214 --> 04:19.134
I would prefer a headlamp,
such as one would use for spelunking.

04:19.885 --> 04:20.928
Okay.

04:21.011 --> 04:24.807
Let me check
my spelunking supplies.

04:24.890 --> 04:27.059
You're a peach.

04:27.142 --> 04:31.063

04:36.819 --> 04:38.529
Good morning,
Medford High School,

04:38.612 --> 04:40.489
this is Class President
Sheldon Cooper

04:40.572 --> 04:42.366
with an important
science bulletin.

04:42.449 --> 04:43.534
This Wednesday morning,

04:43.617 --> 04:45.220
the Nobel Prize in Physics
will be announced,

04:45.244 --> 04:48.372
<i>and I'd like to invite each and
every one of you to my garage</i>

04:48.455 --> 04:51.917
to listen live at 5:00 a.m.
and be a part of scientific history.

04:52.001 --> 04:54.586
<i>- Food and refreshments will be served...</i>
- You worried your kid

04:54.670 --> 04:56.839
just invited the whole school
to your house?

04:56.922 --> 04:59.842
At 5:00 in the morning
for a Swedish science thing?

04:59.925 --> 05:02.720
Not at all.

05:02.803 --> 05:05.639
<i>In other school news,
this Friday night our football team</i>

05:05.723 --> 05:07.766
<i>will be playing
another football team.</i>

05:13.063 --> 05:14.398
Hello?

05:14.481 --> 05:16.734
Hi, Connie.
This is Dr. Linkletter.

05:16.817 --> 05:19.194
I work in the physics department
with Dr. Sturgis.

05:19.278 --> 05:21.280
Oh, sure, I remember you.

05:21.363 --> 05:22.865
What can I do for you?

05:22.948 --> 05:24.801
Well, I'm just calling to let
you know that John is fine,

05:24.825 --> 05:27.106
but there's been a bit of
an incident at the school today.

05:27.161 --> 05:28.787
What happened?

05:28.871 --> 05:30.873
He broke into
the mainframe computer lab,

05:30.956 --> 05:31.957
tripped off an alarm.

05:32.041 --> 05:34.209
Security came,
and there was a chase.

05:34.293 --> 05:35.627
A chase?

05:35.711 --> 05:38.130
It was a short one.
He's not a fast man.

05:38.213 --> 05:40.132
Uh... well, where is he now?

05:40.215 --> 05:42.217
He's in the dean's office.

05:42.301 --> 05:44.053
He has you listed
as the emergency contact,

05:44.136 --> 05:45.721
so I just wanted
to let you know.

05:45.804 --> 05:47.097
Well, uh... thank you

05:47.181 --> 05:49.224
- so much for calling.
- My pleasure.

05:49.308 --> 05:51.935
<i>If there's anything else I can do,
feel free to reach out.</i>

05:52.478 --> 05:54.080
Or if you'd like to go
grab a coffee sometime,

05:54.104 --> 05:55.814
I know a cute little cafe.

05:55.898 --> 05:57.191
Do you like scones?

05:57.649 --> 06:00.277
You're not actually trying
to hit on me right now, are you?

06:00.361 --> 06:01.904
- Is it working?
- No.

06:02.780 --> 06:03.781
I should go.

06:11.705 --> 06:13.183
What kind of snacks
do you think I should serve

06:13.207 --> 06:14.917
at my Nobel gathering?

06:15.000 --> 06:18.128
It's on Swedish radio.
How about Swedish meatballs?

06:18.212 --> 06:19.505
But it's at 5:00 a.m.

06:19.588 --> 06:21.799
Swedish breakfast balls?

06:22.424 --> 06:24.635
I could offer an assortment
of breakfast cereal.

06:24.718 --> 06:27.638
My mom doesn't let me have
cereal with sugar in it.

06:28.263 --> 06:30.057
Or anything that makes me happy.

06:36.063 --> 06:39.191
Connie. What are you doing here?

06:40.317 --> 06:41.860
Well...

06:42.444 --> 06:45.114
I got a call
from your friend Linkletter,

06:45.197 --> 06:47.074
and, uh...

06:47.157 --> 06:49.785
I... I was a little worried
about you.

06:50.494 --> 06:51.662
What did he say?

06:51.745 --> 06:54.289
That you had some
kind of scuffle

06:54.373 --> 06:55.833
with the campus security?

06:55.916 --> 06:57.209
No scuffle.

06:57.292 --> 06:59.837
I was using
the university's mainframe,

06:59.920 --> 07:02.423
and they asked me to leave.
Simple as that.

07:02.506 --> 07:04.716
So nobody chased you?

07:04.800 --> 07:06.844
I was startled, and so I did

07:06.927 --> 07:09.763
what any normal person does
under the circumstances:

07:09.847 --> 07:13.142
Climb out a window
and run like the dickens.

07:16.603 --> 07:19.523
<i>Hi, I'm Kurt Loder,
this is</i> MTV News...

07:19.606 --> 07:21.400
Since when do we get MTV?

07:21.483 --> 07:22.985
Since I got cable.

07:23.735 --> 07:25.487
What do you mean, you got cable?

07:25.571 --> 07:27.948
I called up the cable company
and I said, "Hello,

07:28.031 --> 07:30.200
I'd like cable,"
and they put in cable.

07:30.284 --> 07:31.660
I'm not paying for that.

07:31.743 --> 07:34.121
Keep your shirt on.
I paid for it.

07:34.204 --> 07:35.163
Is that so?

07:35.164 --> 07:37.875
Yeah, with money
I saved from my job.

07:39.376 --> 07:40.544
Well, okay.

07:42.337 --> 07:44.173
So do we get any
of those movie channels?

07:44.256 --> 07:45.883
Dad, I'm trying
to watch the news.

07:45.966 --> 07:48.343
<i>Billy Idol has recovered
so well from...</i>

07:51.972 --> 07:54.099
What's so important
that I had to run over here?

07:54.183 --> 07:56.101
Come here. I want
to show you something.

07:58.479 --> 08:00.230
Look at this.

08:02.232 --> 08:03.901
John did it.

08:06.028 --> 08:07.529
Oh, dear.

08:07.613 --> 08:09.072
"Oh, dear" is right.

08:09.156 --> 08:11.200
Was he in here taking a bath

08:11.283 --> 08:13.702
and just started thinking
about science stuff?

08:13.785 --> 08:15.913
Read the top right part.

08:17.748 --> 08:18.957
"Time plus heat

08:19.041 --> 08:22.336
plus bread equals toast."

08:23.128 --> 08:25.339
That ain't science.

08:25.422 --> 08:27.424
Well, it's not wrong, either.

08:28.509 --> 08:30.177
Look at this.

08:32.971 --> 08:36.517
Yeah, well, that's... peculiar.

08:37.267 --> 08:39.727
You'll be amazed to know
that the Nobel Prize,

08:39.811 --> 08:42.188
while being the most prestigious
award in science,

08:42.272 --> 08:44.483
is not generally celebrated
in this country.

08:44.566 --> 08:46.985
No parades, no fireworks.

08:47.069 --> 08:49.005
Which is why I thought having
a breakfast celebration

08:49.029 --> 08:52.533
was not only appropriate,
but long overdue.

08:53.075 --> 08:54.915
You may have noticed
that I went with Cheerios,

08:54.952 --> 08:57.204
and believe me, it was
a decision that I came to

08:57.287 --> 08:59.122
after careful consideration.

08:59.206 --> 09:00.916
There were birds
on the Froot Loops,

09:00.999 --> 09:04.294
Cocoa Puffs and Corn Flakes,
so they were out.

09:05.420 --> 09:07.260
And leprechauns and elves
are magical creatures

09:07.339 --> 09:10.175
that would be a slap in the face
to the scientific community.

09:11.385 --> 09:14.096
Anyway, the festivities begin
at 4:30 a.m.

09:14.179 --> 09:15.597
You're most welcome to come.

09:15.681 --> 09:17.432
As are you, unhappy bag boy.

09:31.488 --> 09:32.781
What the hell is this?

09:36.577 --> 09:38.829
TV's asking me
for some kind of code.

09:38.912 --> 09:40.789
Yeah, that's the
parental control lock.

09:40.872 --> 09:42.791
- So how do I take it off?
- You don't.

09:42.874 --> 09:45.502
This is my cable
that I bought with my money.

09:45.586 --> 09:47.212
You got to be kidding me.

09:47.296 --> 09:49.715
Here's an idea.
How about you go read a book?

09:50.424 --> 09:52.718
Oh, this isn't over, little man.

09:54.553 --> 09:56.305
Not by a long shot!

10:00.267 --> 10:02.019
You know what I like
about you, Sheldon?

10:02.102 --> 10:04.813
You're incredibly smart,
but you're also really dumb.

10:04.896 --> 10:06.189
Why would you say that?

10:06.648 --> 10:08.835
You think people are gonna
come here to hang out with you?

10:08.859 --> 10:10.277
Yes.

10:10.360 --> 10:12.738
- To hear about science?
- Yes.

10:12.821 --> 10:15.240
- On the radio?
- Yes.

10:15.324 --> 10:17.117
At 5:00 in the morning?

10:17.200 --> 10:18.535
Yes.

10:18.619 --> 10:20.162
And you're asking me
why you're dumb?

10:20.245 --> 10:22.039
Well, I happen to have
a little more faith

10:22.122 --> 10:23.832
in the curiosity
of my fellows.

10:24.374 --> 10:26.501
See, you sound smart,
but you're still dumb.

10:26.585 --> 10:29.129
I bet you don't even know
the first thing about Sweden.

10:29.212 --> 10:30.297
Well, you're wrong,

10:30.380 --> 10:32.549
it's where those little
meatballs come from.

10:33.342 --> 10:36.553
And that chef on The Muppets.
That's two things.

10:37.220 --> 10:40.891
Oh, and it's in Canada.
That's three.

10:51.443 --> 10:52.444
Hello?

10:52.527 --> 10:53.820
Hello, Dr. Linkletter.

10:53.904 --> 10:55.238
This is Connie Tucker.

10:55.322 --> 10:57.616
Connie, how lovely
to hear from you.

10:57.699 --> 10:59.284
Stop. I'm worried about John.

10:59.368 --> 11:01.679
He was supposed to be here for dinner
and he never showed up.

11:01.703 --> 11:05.123
That's not good. He also missed
two of his classes today.

11:05.207 --> 11:07.376
Do you have any idea
where he might be?

11:07.459 --> 11:09.628
Hard to say.
If he's having another episode,

11:09.711 --> 11:10.962
he could be anywhere.

11:11.046 --> 11:13.423
Hold on, what do you mean,
"episode"?

11:13.507 --> 11:14.859
Oh, I thought you knew.
In the past,

11:14.883 --> 11:17.344
John has struggled
with his grip on reality.

11:17.427 --> 11:19.763
What kind of struggle
are we talking about?

11:20.514 --> 11:22.432
The kind where he's had
to be hospitalized.

11:23.767 --> 11:26.228
Well, he never said anything
about that to me.

11:27.145 --> 11:29.606
Well, I certainly wouldn't
fabricate such a story.

11:30.899 --> 11:33.860
Okay, look, if... if you
hear from him or see him,

11:33.944 --> 11:35.362
please let me know.

11:35.445 --> 11:36.863
Of course.

11:37.489 --> 11:38.490
Now, if down the road

11:38.573 --> 11:40.176
things don't work out
with you two, I'd love to...

11:40.200 --> 11:41.660
Good-bye.

12:05.475 --> 12:08.228
- Here, this is for you.
- What is it?

12:08.311 --> 12:10.731
Read it. You do remember
how to read, don't you?

12:14.860 --> 12:16.528
A bill? Really?

12:17.571 --> 12:18.989
Room and board, buddy.

12:19.072 --> 12:21.032
$50 a month for food?

12:21.116 --> 12:23.910
The way you eat,
I should've gone $50 a week.

12:24.453 --> 12:25.787
Laundry services?

12:25.871 --> 12:29.040
Your poor mother has to touch
your underwear.

12:31.042 --> 12:33.795
What's the $10 a month
"peema" charge?

12:33.879 --> 12:37.466
Oh, P-I-M-A,
that's a "Pain in My Ass" tax.

12:37.549 --> 12:39.176
My way of getting
compensated for you

12:39.259 --> 12:41.052
taking years off my life.

12:44.765 --> 12:46.349
John?

12:50.020 --> 12:51.813
John?

12:58.320 --> 13:01.239
Your bike's here. John?

13:07.579 --> 13:08.705
John?

13:23.929 --> 13:27.974
Well, look at that,
there's boobies on my TV.

13:28.058 --> 13:29.434
Ooh!

13:30.227 --> 13:31.436
Get out of here!

13:31.520 --> 13:32.938
I'm telling Mom!

13:56.461 --> 13:57.921
John?

13:59.714 --> 14:01.091
Hello.

14:02.384 --> 14:03.885
What... what're you doing?

14:03.969 --> 14:06.388
I was doing tai chi

14:06.471 --> 14:08.974
and then I realized
that I was

14:09.057 --> 14:13.603
continually being bombarded
by subatomic particles

14:13.687 --> 14:16.982
and it behooves me, perhaps,

14:17.065 --> 14:20.068
to pay slightly closer
attention to them.

14:22.112 --> 14:26.700
Maybe "chi" is the
ancient Chinese word

14:26.783 --> 14:29.578
for the subatomic universe.

14:30.662 --> 14:33.164
You're scaring me, John.

14:33.248 --> 14:36.001
Well, there's nothing
to be scared of.

14:36.084 --> 14:39.880
Tomorrow, somebody will win
the Nobel Prize

14:39.963 --> 14:41.882
about these particles...

14:41.965 --> 14:43.341
not me.

14:45.218 --> 14:49.306
But I'm experiencing
them firsthand...

14:49.389 --> 14:51.641
...which could be better.

14:52.559 --> 14:54.853
Why don't you come down
and experience them

14:54.936 --> 14:56.438
on the floor?

14:56.521 --> 15:00.609
I think I just felt a neutrino.

15:02.402 --> 15:05.530
You know, neutrinos
are interesting.

15:06.656 --> 15:09.576
They never bond with anything.

15:10.577 --> 15:12.913
They're always alone.

15:14.456 --> 15:18.126
I think that one went
right through my pants.

15:20.170 --> 15:21.421
All right,

15:22.088 --> 15:24.466
why don't we
go downstairs,

15:24.549 --> 15:27.928
and I'll fix us both
a nice cup of hot tea

15:28.011 --> 15:31.056
and you can tell me
all about it.

15:36.394 --> 15:38.229
Please?

15:45.654 --> 15:47.280
Okay.

15:59.000 --> 16:01.586
It was my dream
to win the Nobel,

16:02.337 --> 16:04.255
and I'm not going to.

16:08.426 --> 16:11.054
I bet Sheldon will.

16:11.137 --> 16:12.806
That'll be something.

16:13.306 --> 16:14.933
Yeah.

16:33.326 --> 16:35.036
<i>...to Radio Sweden...</i>

16:35.120 --> 16:36.663
How's it going, baby?

16:36.746 --> 16:40.333
I don't think anyone's
showing up, not even Tam.

16:40.417 --> 16:41.918
I'm here.

16:42.002 --> 16:45.922
Yeah, but you're my mom.
You live on the premises.

16:46.840 --> 16:49.551
At least Dr. Sturgis
should be here any minute.

16:50.677 --> 16:52.762
Shelly, I'm afraid Dr. Sturgis

16:52.846 --> 16:54.848
isn't coming this morning.

16:55.432 --> 16:56.516
Why not?

16:59.561 --> 17:01.354
He isn't feeling well.

17:02.272 --> 17:03.648
Oh, dear.

17:05.275 --> 17:07.652
Should we send him
a get well card?

17:07.736 --> 17:10.113
I think that'd be terrific.

17:10.195 --> 17:11.740
<i>Good morning and welcome</i>

17:11.823 --> 17:15.076
<i>to the Royal Swedish
Academy of Sciences.</i>

17:15.160 --> 17:17.287
The announcements are starting.

17:19.039 --> 17:20.248
You want me to stay?

17:20.330 --> 17:23.917
<i>Uh, the Academy has
concluded its meeting and we are</i>

17:24.002 --> 17:25.462
<i>ready to announce this year's...</i>

17:25.545 --> 17:27.464
I'll be in my room
if you need me.

17:30.592 --> 17:33.511
<i>As usual, I will read the
announcements first in English,</i>

17:33.595 --> 17:37.182
<i>then in Swedish,
then the citation in German,</i>

17:37.265 --> 17:39.601
<i>French, and Russian.</i>

17:41.478 --> 17:45.565
<i>And this year's Nobel Prize
in Physics is awarded to...</i>

17:45.648 --> 17:47.817
Come on, neutrinos.

17:48.985 --> 17:51.071
<i>...Henry Kendall,
Jerome Friedman,</i>

17:51.154 --> 17:54.574
<i>and Richard Taylor
for the discovery of quarks.</i>

17:56.910 --> 17:59.120
<i>A primary feature of quarks</i>

17:59.204 --> 18:01.831
<i>is that they're always
bonded together,</i>

18:01.915 --> 18:05.668
<i>but in that moment,
I felt like a neutrino,</i>

18:05.752 --> 18:08.338
<i>destined to be alone forever.</i>

18:14.177 --> 18:17.013
