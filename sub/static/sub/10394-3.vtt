00:15.616 --> 00:21.754
This is the story of one
man, one chef, and a city.

00:21.755 --> 00:25.125
Also it's about France and
a lot of other chefs.

00:25.126 --> 00:26.526
And a culinary tradition that

00:26.527 --> 00:30.363
grew up to change the
world of gastronomy.

00:30.364 --> 00:32.698
It's about a family tree, about

00:32.700 --> 00:37.704
the trunk from which
many branches grew.

00:37.705 --> 00:40.373
It's about food, lots
of food, great food.

00:40.374 --> 00:48.116
Some of the greatest
food on earth.

01:43.871 --> 01:46.439
What is it exactly
about this place?

01:46.440 --> 01:50.177
Over the past century, the
system here, the tradition,

01:50.178 --> 01:51.578
whatever it is that took hold

01:51.579 --> 01:53.213
here, churned out a tremendous

01:53.214 --> 02:00.086
number of the world's
most important chefs.

02:00.087 --> 02:02.689
Chappell, bocuse and most

02:02.690 --> 02:05.392
importantly, influenced
nearly all the rest of them.

02:05.393 --> 02:06.426
Why Lyon?

02:06.427 --> 02:11.864
Why is this such a
gastronomic capital?

02:11.865 --> 02:13.900
Why all of these great chefs?

02:13.901 --> 02:15.235
Because Lyon is really

02:15.236 --> 02:16.636
positioned between the
north and the south.

02:16.637 --> 02:17.104
Right.

02:17.105 --> 02:20.307
You're locked in between
burgundy and Rome.

02:20.308 --> 02:21.741
Lyon is the second largest

02:21.742 --> 02:23.042
city in France, situated in the

02:23.043 --> 02:24.477
southeast of the country midway

02:24.478 --> 02:26.078
between the alps in the east and

02:26.079 --> 02:28.548
the Mediterranean to the south.

02:28.549 --> 02:33.453
This was also a bottleneck
when cars began the mode of

02:33.454 --> 02:33.821
transportation.

02:33.822 --> 02:36.789
Goes right to the heart of
the idea of driving the

02:36.790 --> 02:39.459
destination on the way
to... completely.

02:39.460 --> 02:41.228
Out of that system came chefs

02:41.229 --> 02:47.467
like this guy, Daniel Boulud.

02:47.468 --> 02:50.770
Like prince or Madonna, he
needs really only one name.

02:50.771 --> 02:55.342
In New York or anywhere in
the chef world, Daniel.

02:55.343 --> 02:57.977
The name of his three star

02:57.978 --> 02:59.279
restaurant in Manhattan, one of

02:59.280 --> 03:01.080
many in an empire that stretches

03:01.081 --> 03:03.149
from London to Singapore.

03:03.150 --> 03:07.119
He came from here, a farm
outside the city of Lyon,

03:07.120 --> 03:10.623
through the city's great

03:10.624 --> 03:13.460
kitchens into New York,
then his flagship.

03:13.461 --> 03:14.961
When did you start
working with food?

03:14.962 --> 03:17.997
14 years old, 1969.

03:17.998 --> 03:20.333
I started as an
apprentice in Lyon.

03:20.334 --> 03:22.302
He started as so many French

03:22.303 --> 03:24.271
cooks of his time did,
at the very bottom.

03:24.272 --> 03:27.974
As a 14-year-old apprentice
in the restaurant.

03:27.975 --> 03:29.509
What was your first
job in the kitchen?

03:29.510 --> 03:34.113
They used to call me the
beaver, because I was just

03:34.114 --> 03:35.348
washing every single day.

03:35.349 --> 03:38.050
They make you clean the
vegetable, they make you carry

03:38.051 --> 03:39.185
all the boxes from the market.

03:39.186 --> 03:39.787
14.

03:39.788 --> 03:42.655
You can't do that
anymore, can you?

03:42.656 --> 03:43.723
I don't think you can make

03:43.724 --> 03:47.026
him work 12 hours a day and pay

03:47.027 --> 03:49.028
him maybe a buck a month.

03:49.029 --> 03:53.132
Ah, the good old days.

03:53.133 --> 03:55.034
Why Lyon?

03:55.035 --> 03:58.204
Why here?

03:58.205 --> 04:00.973
Look at the fundamentals, the

04:00.974 --> 04:05.077
things that Lyonaisese
think of as birthrights.

04:05.078 --> 04:06.579
The right to eat delicious cured

04:06.580 --> 04:11.017
pork in unimaginably
delicious forms.

04:11.018 --> 04:15.588
The art of chocolatery,
they can't live without it.

04:15.589 --> 04:18.425
Pate, sausages, it's an art

04:18.426 --> 04:24.064
that's revered here
and widely enjoyed.

04:26.033 --> 04:31.103
Few names garner more
represent from aficionados of

04:31.104 --> 04:36.443
pig.

04:36.444 --> 04:39.746
20 ton just inside this room.

04:39.747 --> 04:43.082
They are going mad
with the prediction.

04:43.083 --> 04:45.752
In a relentlessly cold room,

04:45.753 --> 04:48.087
pork shoulder, belly and fat

04:48.088 --> 04:51.891
back are fed in batches
through a vertical chopper.

04:51.892 --> 04:56.128
The sprinkling of
seasoning and spices.

04:56.129 --> 04:57.897
Removed in large balls of finely

04:57.898 --> 05:01.067
but not too finely chopped leek.

05:01.068 --> 05:02.569
You do not want to get your hand

05:02.570 --> 05:05.304
caught in one of these things.

05:05.305 --> 05:11.711
Then mixed to smooth
perfection with a dough hook.

05:11.712 --> 05:12.979
Lot of work.

05:12.980 --> 05:14.981
Spread out and layered for

05:14.982 --> 05:16.383
consistent seasoning, formed

05:16.384 --> 05:22.088
into shapes and smacked
to remove air bubbles.

05:22.089 --> 05:24.391
Make sure the meat
gets really tight.

05:24.392 --> 05:26.393
Into the sausage machine and

05:26.394 --> 05:31.130
piped into organic casings.

05:31.131 --> 05:39.131
Trust me, it ain't easy.

05:47.147 --> 05:48.180
Very light touch.

05:48.181 --> 05:50.917
Let's see now.

05:50.918 --> 05:51.151
Come on.

05:51.152 --> 05:55.955
Let's see this.

05:55.956 --> 06:01.628
That's how you get pregnant.

06:01.629 --> 06:03.362
It's all in the meat.

06:03.363 --> 06:04.197
Yeah.

06:04.198 --> 06:05.432
Just release at the end.

06:05.433 --> 06:08.100
It's a serious workplace but

06:08.101 --> 06:09.101
with production nearly done,

06:09.102 --> 06:13.806
this being France and all, it's

06:13.807 --> 06:14.442
time for a snack and some wine.

06:14.442 --> 06:14.975
Doing what I'm good at.

06:14.976 --> 06:20.346
Eating.

06:20.347 --> 06:27.520
This is so good.

06:27.521 --> 06:29.722
Another of Lyon's most famous

06:29.723 --> 06:30.957
sausages is made primarily from

06:30.958 --> 06:33.392
pig's head with pork belly, pork

06:33.393 --> 06:35.294
shoulder, Brandy, nutmeg and

06:35.295 --> 06:39.031
allspice mixed in for flavor.

06:39.032 --> 06:40.533
Man, it's good.

06:40.534 --> 06:42.068
We're going to eat
with my father.

06:42.069 --> 06:48.675
Oh, yeah?

06:48.676 --> 06:50.176
He knows he does
really good work.

06:50.177 --> 06:50.644
Huh?

06:50.645 --> 06:52.178
He knows how good his stuff is.

06:52.179 --> 06:55.347
Cheers.

06:55.348 --> 06:56.483
Nice... it's a
beautiful day in Lyon.

06:56.484 --> 07:04.484
Yeah.

07:08.261 --> 07:10.262
In Lyon, a city that believes

07:10.263 --> 07:12.031
absolutely in the power of food,

07:12.032 --> 07:14.767
one name is everywhere.

07:14.768 --> 07:17.737
The name that brought honor,
attention and millions of

07:17.738 --> 07:19.105
visitors to the city.

07:19.106 --> 07:20.607
Though there have been many chef

07:20.608 --> 07:25.277
heroes in the annals of
gastronomy, in Lyon and even

07:25.278 --> 07:29.281
cross France, one name
stands above all others.

07:29.282 --> 07:34.353
Murals, Bridges, markets, casual

07:34.354 --> 07:38.390
brasserie, the name of
missour Paul is everywhere.

07:38.391 --> 07:43.395
One of his most enduring
institutions is this.

07:43.396 --> 07:51.396
One of the nation's
great culinary schools.

07:52.272 --> 07:53.439
Now, just to give you an idea of

07:53.440 --> 07:55.274
the standards here, the kind of

07:55.275 --> 07:56.609
traditional dishes, baseline old

07:56.610 --> 07:57.710
school fundamentals you're

07:57.711 --> 07:59.546
expected to master before you

07:59.547 --> 08:02.882
move on at becoming a creative

08:02.883 --> 08:10.883
genius all your own,
meet these guys.

08:13.594 --> 08:19.465
Matthew, Joseph and the
institute's top dog, Alain.

08:19.466 --> 08:22.301
Chefs at M.O.S., all.

08:22.302 --> 08:23.936
Otherwise known as mos.

08:23.937 --> 08:26.839
Otherwise pay your
flight home, private.

08:26.840 --> 08:28.274
Master chefs.

08:28.275 --> 08:35.014
Every four years, they
have this competition.

08:35.015 --> 08:37.448
The master craftsmen of France.

08:37.450 --> 08:41.654
There's about 30 discipline
of craftsmen where you can

08:41.655 --> 08:42.623
acquire the M.O.F.

08:42.624 --> 08:49.929
See that red, white and
blue around their necks?

08:49.930 --> 08:50.598
That means they made it through

08:50.599 --> 08:55.968
the rigorous competition where
only a handful survive.

08:55.969 --> 08:57.970
Certified by the highest in the

08:57.971 --> 08:59.939
land as being at the very top of

08:59.940 --> 09:06.212
the top of their professions.

09:06.213 --> 09:09.315
M.O.F. Challenges often include

09:09.316 --> 09:10.050
ultra old school classics not

09:10.051 --> 09:16.288
unlike the one we're
making today.

09:16.289 --> 09:23.195
Poulair Au visse.

09:23.196 --> 09:25.064
The rolls Royce of chickens.

09:25.065 --> 09:27.466
It's then tied, slipped inside a

09:27.467 --> 09:30.302
pig's bladder and
steamed until tender.

09:30.303 --> 09:31.838
The idea is to concentrate

09:31.839 --> 09:35.908
the flavor of the truffle
inside the bladder.

09:35.909 --> 09:37.209
The dish they choose, it's

09:37.210 --> 09:40.579
always in reference to
a chef of the past.

09:40.580 --> 09:46.152
And this was a dish
they were doing.

09:46.153 --> 09:47.654
The at times brutal world of

09:47.655 --> 09:49.856
the kitchen looks much of the

09:49.857 --> 09:53.225
time like a boys' club but
where did they come from?

09:53.226 --> 09:54.861
If we track back a bit to where

09:54.862 --> 09:56.228
it all began for Lyon and for

09:56.229 --> 09:57.997
many of the chefs whose names we

09:57.998 --> 10:05.604
now know and look up to,
it all goes back to here.

10:05.605 --> 10:10.710
La mer brass Erie, the
godmother, the original master.

10:10.711 --> 10:12.444
Teacher, chef, force.

10:12.445 --> 10:17.583
Two restaurants with
three Michelin stars.

10:17.584 --> 10:19.752
An achievement no one, male or

10:19.753 --> 10:20.887
female, had attained and for

10:20.888 --> 10:25.024
many years, Lyon's
most famous chef.

10:25.025 --> 10:26.558
Her influence runs right through

10:26.559 --> 10:28.895
every kitchen that's come since

10:28.896 --> 10:30.697
and her graduates carry on her

10:30.698 --> 10:35.467
recipes and her traditions.

10:35.468 --> 10:37.036
This was one of
hers, a signature.

10:37.037 --> 10:40.539
For the next hour, you
keep putting it like this.

10:40.540 --> 10:43.409
The most miserable thing is
when the bladder explodes.

10:43.410 --> 10:45.945
That's never a good thing
when a bladder explodes.

10:45.946 --> 10:50.750
As the chicken proves, the
bladder is really tough to

10:50.751 --> 10:50.984
expand.

10:50.985 --> 10:53.052
You have to talk
to your bladder.

10:53.053 --> 10:54.553
I do all the time, believe me.

10:54.554 --> 10:55.922
Please hold up, please hold up.

10:55.923 --> 10:56.757
Not here, people are looking.

10:56.758 --> 10:59.258
Wait until you get
in between cars.

10:59.259 --> 11:02.094
A rather luxurious sauce of

11:02.095 --> 11:04.330
more, much more black truffle

11:04.331 --> 11:09.635
and generous amounts of
foie gras and triple cream.

11:09.636 --> 11:11.670
Perfect.

11:11.671 --> 11:19.671
Nice milkshake.

11:20.347 --> 11:22.014
Slightly pink around the legs

11:22.015 --> 11:23.515
but cooked through, the flesh

11:23.516 --> 11:26.185
perfumed by the generous
slices of truffle.

11:26.186 --> 11:27.154
Who gets to eat like this?

11:27.155 --> 11:32.759
We do.

11:32.760 --> 11:33.626
How is it?

11:33.626 --> 11:34.327
Divine.

11:34.328 --> 11:36.195
You see the perfect
balance in the sauce.

11:36.196 --> 11:37.529
If I was a chicken, that's the

11:37.530 --> 11:38.798
way I would like to end up.

11:38.799 --> 11:40.166
Even if I weren't a chicken,

11:40.167 --> 11:42.101
I would like to go like this.

11:42.102 --> 11:43.936
Die surrounded by truffles and

11:43.937 --> 11:47.840
foie gras and fine wine.

11:47.841 --> 11:50.911
Merci. Merci.

12:05.392 --> 12:08.227
The roaring of a
powerful engine.

12:08.228 --> 12:10.830
The screech of rubber
and off we go.

12:10.831 --> 12:14.133
Kings of the road
in our Citroen.

12:14.134 --> 12:19.872
Two horse power classic.

12:19.873 --> 12:21.340
No power steering, huh?

12:21.341 --> 12:26.245
You're kidding.

12:26.246 --> 12:28.180
It's like a toy car.

12:28.181 --> 12:29.715
We're going back in time a bit,

12:29.716 --> 12:32.551
to the area where Daniel
grew up, where life was very

12:32.552 --> 12:34.753
different from New York.

12:34.754 --> 12:38.357
Were you the misfit of the
family, rebellious or...

12:38.358 --> 12:40.092
I was quite rebellious.

12:40.093 --> 12:41.593
My parents were talking to me

12:41.594 --> 12:44.430
about the idea of
taking over the farm.

12:44.431 --> 12:45.998
As the oldest son, that would

12:45.999 --> 12:48.567
have been the logical thing.

12:48.568 --> 12:48.836
Right.

12:48.837 --> 12:50.202
The farmer's life
was not for you.

12:50.203 --> 12:50.703
No.

12:50.704 --> 12:53.172
He grew up in a
true farm family.

12:53.173 --> 12:56.342
You milk the cows,
tended the animals.

12:56.343 --> 12:58.677
Daniel claims he never even saw

12:58.678 --> 13:06.678
processed food until
he was a teenager.

13:29.142 --> 13:31.243
A brief respite by the side

13:31.244 --> 13:33.112
of the road and some passersby

13:33.113 --> 13:34.480
are apparently less appreciative

13:34.481 --> 13:37.116
of fine automobiles than we are.

13:37.117 --> 13:38.985
A short consultation with an

13:38.986 --> 13:39.652
automotive professional and we

13:39.653 --> 13:43.923
are back on the road, back
in this case to school.

13:43.924 --> 13:47.059
This was Daniel's old elementary

13:47.060 --> 13:53.099
school in a nearby town.

13:53.100 --> 13:54.666
I'm automatically taken back to

13:54.667 --> 13:56.635
memories of my own school days.

13:56.636 --> 13:58.437
The smell of caustic pine

13:58.438 --> 14:01.307
cleaner, chalkboards and fear.

14:01.308 --> 14:05.844
The cruel ministrations of

14:05.845 --> 14:07.613
tiny-eyed lunch ladies slopping

14:07.614 --> 14:11.918
canloads of prison chow
into steam tables.

14:11.919 --> 14:13.119
Tuna noodle surprise that haunt

14:13.120 --> 14:20.993
my sense memories still.

14:20.994 --> 14:24.696
Pumpkin soup today with

14:24.697 --> 14:27.599
onion, nutmeg and chicken stock.

14:27.600 --> 14:29.268
Basic good pumpkin soup.

14:29.269 --> 14:33.605
This is Marie, head chef,

14:33.606 --> 14:35.307
cook, host and server for 320

14:35.308 --> 14:36.875
hungry and very discriminating

14:36.876 --> 14:39.445
French schoolchildren
ages 3 to 12.

14:39.446 --> 14:47.446
On the menu, prefix today,
pumpkin soup, home made

14:50.623 --> 14:53.159
cous-cous and a sauce supreme.

14:53.160 --> 14:56.462
This is a very sophisticated
meal for children.

14:56.463 --> 14:58.197
I was a little...
In school, frankly.

14:58.198 --> 14:59.398
Like a lot of other students, I

14:59.399 --> 15:00.899
want pizza, pizza, pizza, are

15:00.900 --> 15:05.237
the children here
open to variety?

15:05.238 --> 15:07.239
We want to make sure they

15:07.240 --> 15:09.041
always get a little challenge by

15:09.042 --> 15:10.709
how the food looks and the smell

15:10.710 --> 15:12.744
and also, the taste after.

15:12.745 --> 15:15.347
I think she has a
very strict budget.

15:15.348 --> 15:16.915
In the USA, greatest country

15:16.916 --> 15:20.419
in the world, no doubt, we spend

15:20.420 --> 15:23.055
an average of $2.75 per student

15:23.056 --> 15:24.024
for public school lunch.

15:24.025 --> 15:26.993
Compare and contrast.

15:26.994 --> 15:27.894
$1.50.

15:27.895 --> 15:29.228
Did you eat this well
when you were here?

15:29.229 --> 15:37.229
Absolutely.

15:38.171 --> 15:40.239
Bon jour.

15:40.240 --> 15:43.275
The kids attack their food

15:43.276 --> 15:46.078
like hungry trenchmen, wiping

15:46.079 --> 15:48.247
out three servings in the
time it takes me to eat one.

15:48.248 --> 15:49.248
I guess they like it.

15:49.249 --> 15:50.549
It's good.

15:50.550 --> 15:51.783
This is good.

15:51.784 --> 15:59.784
I don't think my chef in
new York would do better.

16:00.393 --> 16:01.727
These kids eat fast.

16:01.728 --> 16:04.896
Look how fast this kid eats.

16:04.897 --> 16:06.298
Turn your head, he'll dish your

16:06.299 --> 16:08.967
food right out of your plate.

16:08.968 --> 16:10.969
Push up your tray just like
in prison, move it along.

16:10.970 --> 16:12.071
Move it along.

16:12.072 --> 16:14.073
They come to you and serve you.

16:14.074 --> 16:17.443
Most important thing that we see

16:17.444 --> 16:18.744
here is the love Mary give to

16:18.745 --> 16:21.447
the food she make and
to the kids she serves.

16:21.448 --> 16:22.881
I think it has a lot to do with

16:22.882 --> 16:25.484
the reaction they have to food.

16:25.485 --> 16:29.255
Dessert is homemade fromage

16:29.256 --> 16:31.057
blanc, cheese with chocolate
and orange segments.

16:31.058 --> 16:34.060
What do you want to
be when you grow up?

16:34.061 --> 16:41.133
Fireman.

16:41.134 --> 16:41.634
Generate machine gun.

16:41.635 --> 16:44.170
He wants to make...
Generate machine gun, yeah.

16:44.171 --> 16:44.671
Okay.

16:44.671 --> 16:45.172
Keep an eye on that one.

16:45.173 --> 16:53.173
All right.

16:53.346 --> 16:56.482
For a dope fiend, feeding the
monkey means finding and

16:56.483 --> 16:57.783
sticking with heroin.

16:57.784 --> 17:00.619
For one poor guy, it's this.

17:00.620 --> 17:08.619
French food, in particular,
lyonaise food.

17:10.597 --> 17:12.964
The cautionary tale of bill

17:12.964 --> 17:14.366
Buford, literary lion with a

17:14.367 --> 17:16.367
perfectly good job as fiction

17:16.368 --> 17:18.637
editor at "new yorker" magazine,

17:18.637 --> 17:21.307
at the undignified age of 53, he

17:21.308 --> 17:22.708
pretty much pulled up stakes,

17:22.709 --> 17:24.210
put his whole past life on hold

17:24.211 --> 17:26.645
and defected to France
to learn how to cook.

17:26.646 --> 17:29.014
What happened to you?

17:29.015 --> 17:31.983
You used to have a good job, you

17:31.984 --> 17:35.053
hung out a couple nights with

17:35.054 --> 17:36.455
battagli and next thing you know

17:36.456 --> 17:37.889
you're living in
France and cooking.

17:37.890 --> 17:40.526
I discovered a whole world
that the rest of the world

17:40.527 --> 17:42.528
didn't seem to know about, just

17:42.529 --> 17:44.996
a very compressed and tense

17:44.997 --> 17:46.898
lifelong learned expertise
and knowledge of food.

17:46.899 --> 17:48.467
It's not the food network and

17:48.468 --> 17:50.402
it's not glossy magazines and

17:50.403 --> 17:52.738
it's not something you get
from reading a recipe book.

17:52.739 --> 17:54.840
It's something you get
by just going deep.

17:54.841 --> 17:59.911
I was afraid of France because I

17:59.912 --> 18:02.047
didn't find when I took on the

18:02.048 --> 18:03.149
subject of French food, I would

18:03.150 --> 18:04.316
have to go really deep.

18:04.317 --> 18:05.351
I went and thought we would have

18:05.352 --> 18:11.323
to stay for six months and
we stayed for five years.

18:11.324 --> 18:16.328
We meet at a uniquely lyonaise
institution, a casual

18:16.329 --> 18:20.266
laid-back kind of pub/bistro

18:20.267 --> 18:23.034
with a limited old school menu

18:23.035 --> 18:26.738
and always, always an
unpreten shouse vibe.

18:26.739 --> 18:28.006
People come here to unwind,

18:28.007 --> 18:31.710
relax and eat with abandon.

18:31.711 --> 18:34.613
So you say outright recently in

18:34.614 --> 18:35.614
one of your published works that

18:35.615 --> 18:38.850
Lyon is better than Paris.

18:38.851 --> 18:41.953
Lyon is beautiful, well-eating
city and everybody

18:41.954 --> 18:43.889
here knows they have a really

18:43.890 --> 18:47.926
good life and they don't give a

18:47.927 --> 18:49.761
flying fig if anybody
else knows about it.

18:49.762 --> 18:53.265
They don't actually
want visitors.

18:53.266 --> 18:59.538
If you were to pick one
iconic dish to represent, it

18:59.539 --> 19:02.974
would have to be
the canel broche.

19:02.975 --> 19:04.743
Not particularly fabulous river

19:04.744 --> 19:07.078
fish, pike, folded into a light

19:07.079 --> 19:09.315
dough until fluffy and airy but

19:09.316 --> 19:11.783
still rich, adrift in a rich

19:11.784 --> 19:15.587
creamy, almost bisque-like sauce

19:15.588 --> 19:21.593
made with crayfish,
creme fresh and Brandy.

19:21.594 --> 19:28.133
It's kind of a nice mix
of France and Italy.

19:28.134 --> 19:32.339
What a treat to eat
together in Lyon.

19:43.983 --> 19:49.655
If you're really gonna
understand a place, love it the

19:49.656 --> 19:50.623
way it deserves to be loved,

19:50.623 --> 19:51.591
maybe you have to live there.

19:51.592 --> 19:54.426
Bill Buford did just that
and made Lyon his home.

19:54.427 --> 19:55.761
Today he's taking me somewhere

19:55.762 --> 19:57.095
only someone from the home team

19:57.096 --> 19:58.797
could be expected to know about.

19:58.798 --> 20:01.367
It's a beautiful day.

20:01.368 --> 20:03.469
The sky is blue, we're feeling

20:03.470 --> 20:05.203
the seasons changing and we're

20:05.204 --> 20:07.038
about to go into a dark room,

20:07.039 --> 20:11.009
and you eat a very lyonaise menu

20:11.010 --> 20:13.211
and drink a vast
quantity of wine.

20:13.212 --> 20:14.646
What sinister bodies
will be in there?

20:14.647 --> 20:16.114
Only kind of people who would

20:16.115 --> 20:18.617
do this kind of thing on a

20:18.618 --> 20:21.787
bright pretty day, its's
a very male tradition.

20:21.788 --> 20:29.788
You work hard, you drink harder.

20:33.633 --> 20:34.866
Uh-oh.

20:34.867 --> 20:35.867
Don't be afraid.

20:35.868 --> 20:37.035
Don't be afraid.

20:37.036 --> 20:39.170
The mysterious, fabulous,

20:39.171 --> 20:42.474
goofy, wonderful bro-fests are

20:42.475 --> 20:43.975
basically eating and drinking

20:43.976 --> 20:45.811
societies that go back over a

20:45.812 --> 20:47.212
century, when the silk workers

20:47.213 --> 20:48.847
of Lyon would finish their night

20:48.848 --> 20:50.582
shifts early in the morning.

20:50.583 --> 20:51.883
Hungry and looking to get, shall

20:51.884 --> 20:56.187
we say, completely hammered,

20:56.188 --> 20:57.589
they would take over, stuff

20:57.590 --> 20:59.991
their faces like heroes, blow

20:59.992 --> 21:02.661
off the proverbial steam in

21:02.662 --> 21:04.029
decidedly French fashion, which

21:04.030 --> 21:10.035
is to say no freakin' guytallion

21:10.036 --> 21:16.875
nachos or mozzerella
sticks for these guys.

21:16.876 --> 21:19.345
All of them have
special memberships?

21:19.346 --> 21:21.279
There must be 50 of those
that I know about.

21:21.280 --> 21:23.549
You are invited to be a member

21:23.550 --> 21:24.950
and remain a member the
rest of your life.

21:24.951 --> 21:28.119
The food is invariably

21:28.120 --> 21:30.088
deliciously dinosauric and heavy

21:30.089 --> 21:31.423
always glorious classics, the

21:31.424 --> 21:34.025
slow, slowly stewed neck and

21:34.026 --> 21:35.794
shoulder pieces of veal with

21:35.795 --> 21:37.128
mushrooms served over rice,

21:37.129 --> 21:45.129
hunks of bread and
wine, and lots of it.

21:52.779 --> 21:54.813
It works, and for 50 years.

21:54.814 --> 21:56.748
Do women have their
own organizations?

21:56.749 --> 21:57.550
Yes.

21:57.550 --> 21:58.418
There are.

21:58.419 --> 21:59.651
So somewhere on the other side

21:59.652 --> 22:00.952
of town, there are a lot of

22:00.953 --> 22:05.791
women sitting around drinking

22:05.792 --> 22:06.726
wine, eating and
complaining about the men.

22:06.726 --> 22:06.993
Uh-oh.

22:06.994 --> 22:08.994
Then there will
be, yes, singing.

22:08.995 --> 22:12.764
And no doubt the telling of

22:12.765 --> 22:20.765
lusty jokes followed by
serious official business.

23:06.152 --> 23:07.453
Alongside and some say above

23:07.454 --> 23:09.120
the names of the other culinary

23:09.121 --> 23:17.121
giants in and around Lyon
is the name trois gros.

23:20.900 --> 23:24.369
It sparked a dynasty of culinary

23:24.370 --> 23:25.237
excellence that continues today

23:25.238 --> 23:29.841
with Pierre's son Michel
and his son, Cesar.

23:29.842 --> 23:37.842
My dream always was to
put it on my resume.

23:37.917 --> 23:40.919
Bon jour.

23:40.920 --> 23:45.256
Many have called Maison trois

23:45.257 --> 23:48.059
gros the best restaurant
in the world.

23:48.060 --> 23:49.327
In the '60s, the brothers were

23:49.328 --> 23:51.096
early, important and fundamental

23:51.097 --> 23:52.397
innovators of what came to be

23:52.398 --> 23:57.836
known as nouvelle cuisine.

23:57.837 --> 24:00.906
Behold, one of their
breakout classics.

24:00.907 --> 24:04.042
One of the truly game-changing,

24:04.043 --> 24:07.913
timeless, most influential
dishes in history.

24:07.914 --> 24:10.381
It seems now maybe a simple

24:10.382 --> 24:12.250
thing, but it absolutely turned

24:12.251 --> 24:14.252
the world upside down when it

24:14.253 --> 24:16.755
debuted on the menu in 1962.

24:16.756 --> 24:18.757
When you have a dish this

24:18.758 --> 24:21.259
legendary, this iconic,
there's no escaping it.

24:21.260 --> 24:22.728
The rolling stones will always

24:22.729 --> 24:24.395
have to play jumping Jack flash.

24:24.396 --> 24:30.736
If you Google foie gras,
you will see this thing.

24:30.737 --> 24:32.738
Forget everything you
have been given.

24:32.739 --> 24:36.875
Before this, fish was
generally overcooked.

24:36.876 --> 24:40.746
It was served alongside
elaborate garnishes, starches,

24:40.747 --> 24:41.080
vegetables.

24:41.081 --> 24:43.749
This simple, elegant, almost

24:43.750 --> 24:46.284
Japanese ode to flavor changed
the way we cook fish in

24:46.285 --> 24:48.319
restaurants today.

24:48.320 --> 24:52.824
And how we make sauces,
what our plates look like.

24:52.825 --> 24:56.227
I remember seeing a picture
of this as a young man.

24:56.228 --> 24:58.263
I'm getting goosebumps
seeing this.

24:58.264 --> 24:59.165
Thrilling.

24:59.166 --> 25:02.167
Perfect.

25:02.168 --> 25:06.605
It's beautiful.

25:06.606 --> 25:13.979
The moment you put
the fish in the pan.

25:13.980 --> 25:16.648
It's very important.

25:16.649 --> 25:24.649
All right.

25:28.795 --> 25:32.698
From now, to you in the
dining room in one minute.

25:32.699 --> 25:33.799
One minute is the time.

25:33.800 --> 25:34.033
Perfect.

25:34.034 --> 25:42.034
Because it's cooking
all the way.

25:42.374 --> 25:42.842
Mm.

25:42.843 --> 25:43.942
Perfect.

25:43.943 --> 25:45.110
It's a perfect dish.

25:45.111 --> 25:46.177
It's really one of the great

25:46.178 --> 25:52.684
ideas of the 20th century.

25:52.685 --> 25:52.985
Fashionable.

25:52.986 --> 25:56.756
Sexy.

26:09.301 --> 26:11.703
When in Lyon, one can't help

26:11.704 --> 26:14.806
but a see line from there, from

26:14.807 --> 26:16.708
the rustic dishes of the farm to

26:16.709 --> 26:19.878
here, the classics of the
great tables of Europe.

26:19.879 --> 26:21.079
All roads lead here.

26:21.080 --> 26:25.483
A major trunk of the tree that

26:25.484 --> 26:33.484
goes back to karem and beyond.

26:35.427 --> 26:37.162
Monseur Paul Bocuse.

26:37.163 --> 26:37.730
The brigade.

26:37.731 --> 26:42.668
The way it is done and has
always been done since a

26:42.669 --> 26:43.902
military style hierarchy was

26:43.903 --> 26:49.274
instituted into the kitchen.

26:49.275 --> 26:50.242
When the only acceptable

26:50.243 --> 26:57.115
response to any question or
any command is oui, chef.

26:57.116 --> 27:02.253
This is the special forces,
the S.a.S., of cooking.

27:02.254 --> 27:05.290
And these cooks live to avoid,

27:05.291 --> 27:10.095
under any circumstances,
disappointing their comrades,

27:10.096 --> 27:12.798
the hierarchy or monseur Paul.

27:12.799 --> 27:14.265
Daniel worked here and so have

27:14.266 --> 27:15.600
many, many who have gone on to

27:15.601 --> 27:19.037
run their own
celebrated kitchens.

27:19.038 --> 27:21.940
In the '70s as a young wanna-be

27:21.941 --> 27:23.942
cook, I managed to lay hands on

27:23.943 --> 27:29.380
a French copy of the classic

27:29.381 --> 27:32.283
cookbook, La Cuisine Du Marche

27:32.284 --> 27:34.419
and I struggled to translate the

27:34.420 --> 27:36.722
descriptions of dishes so
fantastic I was quite sure I

27:36.723 --> 27:44.723
never, ever in my life
would cook, much less eat.

27:49.001 --> 27:52.403
If you could please say how

27:52.404 --> 27:53.805
honored and grateful
I am to be here.

27:53.806 --> 27:56.341
This is a dream come true.

27:56.342 --> 27:58.609
Over the years, how many great

27:58.610 --> 28:01.012
chefs have come through this

28:01.013 --> 28:09.013
restaurant and on to
open great restaurants?

28:15.127 --> 28:17.695
There is a child somewhere
around the world because

28:17.696 --> 28:25.336
everybody goes around the world.

28:25.337 --> 28:27.138
But he is and was
part of the system.

28:27.139 --> 28:28.974
He came up with his own cruel

28:28.975 --> 28:36.975
and terrifying masters and
their faces are here.

28:39.551 --> 28:42.353
The towering and intimidating

28:42.354 --> 28:45.723
figure behind la pyramid.

28:45.724 --> 28:48.559
Owl out of his
kitchens same such

28:48.560 --> 28:52.898
figures as Francois Biese,

28:52.899 --> 28:56.301
George Perrier and many more.

28:56.302 --> 28:59.737
This was all the gang of
the nouvelle cuisine.

28:59.738 --> 29:03.708
The '60s in New York.

29:03.709 --> 29:05.343
Every great chef I have ever

29:05.344 --> 29:08.880
met has nightmares of they're

29:08.881 --> 29:10.548
still a young man, they're back

29:10.549 --> 29:14.886
in a kitchen and a chef
is yelling at him.

29:14.887 --> 29:16.554
Who were his masters?

29:16.555 --> 29:16.856
A woman.

29:16.857 --> 29:20.758
Really?

29:20.759 --> 29:27.098
La mer brassier at the ripe old

29:27.099 --> 29:29.700
age of 20, he worked
as an apprentice.

29:29.701 --> 29:34.039
She was such a screamer.

29:34.040 --> 29:36.207
You would fall on your butt, she

29:36.208 --> 29:37.043
was screaming so hard.

29:37.044 --> 29:39.110
She was the first up in the

29:39.111 --> 29:41.546
morning and the last
one to go to bed.

29:41.547 --> 29:44.415
She would go to the market with

29:44.416 --> 29:45.450
three cook in the back of the

29:45.451 --> 29:46.751
truck and she would put the case

29:46.752 --> 29:48.053
of green beans or something and

29:48.054 --> 29:49.754
the cook will be sitting down

29:49.755 --> 29:52.557
making the beans,
not to waste time.

29:52.558 --> 30:00.298
Truly a terrifying figure.

30:00.299 --> 30:02.733
Truffle soup Elyssee.

30:02.734 --> 30:04.202
I can't tell you how many hours

30:04.203 --> 30:08.039
I stared at photos of this dish,

30:08.040 --> 30:10.575
how pathetically I
tried to replicate it.

30:10.576 --> 30:11.543
Never did I think I would get to

30:11.544 --> 30:18.449
try it, much less like this.

30:18.450 --> 30:21.552
Sea bass with a tomato bernaise

30:21.553 --> 30:24.322
sauce baked in a
meticulously crafted crust.

30:24.323 --> 30:31.162
This is a great moment.

30:31.163 --> 30:35.800
The fish is filled with a
delicate lobster mousse and

30:35.801 --> 30:38.436
tarragon and wrapped
carefully in pastry.

30:38.437 --> 30:45.476
Notice the careful and
tableside carving and service.

30:45.477 --> 30:48.679
He has been making the
same thing for 50 years.

30:48.680 --> 30:54.652
Paul has an amazing
respect for classic.

30:54.653 --> 30:58.289
The peasant classic.

30:58.290 --> 31:00.258
Tony, get closer.

31:00.259 --> 31:01.960
You are totally sending me

31:01.961 --> 31:03.528
every one of those
pictures, by the way.

31:03.529 --> 31:03.695
Wow.

31:03.695 --> 31:04.463
Look at that.

31:04.464 --> 31:05.796
This style of dish goes back

31:05.797 --> 31:07.865
long before cameras
but it's perfect.

31:07.866 --> 31:13.704
Is there a more perfect
assortment of colors and

31:13.705 --> 31:14.040
textures.

31:14.041 --> 31:17.342
This one is a somewhat
more luxurious version.

31:17.343 --> 31:20.111
Beef flanks, oxtail, veal

31:20.112 --> 31:21.980
flanks, chicken, marrow bones,

31:21.981 --> 31:25.016
beef ribs, leeks, carrots,

31:25.017 --> 31:30.021
turnips, fennel and parsnips,

31:30.022 --> 31:32.057
served with its own
deeply rich broth.

31:32.058 --> 31:33.624
Think it's enough
for the two of us?

31:33.625 --> 31:41.625
And then, this.

31:42.468 --> 31:43.801
As if the chef had been

31:43.802 --> 31:47.072
listening to my deepest, darkest

31:47.073 --> 31:54.980
secret yearnings, an almost
completely disappeared,

31:54.981 --> 31:56.914
incredibly difficult
preparation of wild hare.

31:56.915 --> 31:59.850
The animal is first slowly

31:59.851 --> 32:01.719
cooked, then coated by a sauce

32:01.720 --> 32:05.256
of its own minced heart, liver
and lungs that has been

32:05.257 --> 32:07.225
thickened with its own blood.

32:07.226 --> 32:09.060
After more than six hours of

32:09.061 --> 32:10.928
preparation, the hare is served

32:10.929 --> 32:13.331
as the chef prefers, whole on

32:13.332 --> 32:15.100
the bone, the rich glorious

32:15.101 --> 32:23.101
sauce finished with truffles
and chartr chartreuse.

32:24.910 --> 32:28.279
Absolutely the lost
ark of the covenant.

32:28.280 --> 32:29.514
Everything great about cooking
is encapsulated in this

32:29.515 --> 32:31.382
dish.

32:31.383 --> 32:32.517
We continue all over the

32:32.518 --> 32:35.920
world to make cuisine for
many generation to come.

32:35.921 --> 32:36.555
Forever.

32:36.556 --> 32:38.589
I will never eat like
this again in my life.

32:38.590 --> 32:41.292
Chef, merci.

32:41.293 --> 32:42.293
The meal of my life.

32:42.294 --> 32:44.395
Today I was treated to the

32:44.396 --> 32:48.433
greatest hits of a glorious
and fabled career.

32:48.434 --> 32:49.268
For the first and probably the

32:49.269 --> 32:51.636
last time, I sat next to the

32:51.637 --> 32:52.970
great man himself and Daniel and

32:52.971 --> 32:55.440
I were served a menu that chefs

32:55.441 --> 32:58.409
will look back on in a hundred

32:58.410 --> 33:01.146
years and smile at appreciably,

33:01.147 --> 33:03.715
sentimentally, respectfully.

33:20.432 --> 33:23.801
So me and Daniel were going
hunting and over lunch, we

33:23.802 --> 33:26.604
mentioned that fact to Paul, who

33:26.605 --> 33:28.106
immediately insisted, insisted

33:28.107 --> 33:29.774
that if we wanted to go duck

33:29.775 --> 33:31.976
hunting, we should come by his

33:31.977 --> 33:34.011
crib, and so we find ourselves

33:34.012 --> 33:36.314
in the morning mist of Le dawn,

33:36.315 --> 33:39.250
a rural area about a
half hour outside Lyon.

33:39.251 --> 33:41.419
Sure enough, in spite of his 88

33:41.420 --> 33:42.687
years, and the fact that he's

33:42.688 --> 33:44.855
been less than well, 9:00 A.M.

33:44.856 --> 33:46.824
On the nose, there he is,

33:46.825 --> 33:48.493
sitting on top of his beloved

33:48.494 --> 33:53.030
John Deere with his
faithful dog ready to go.

33:53.031 --> 33:56.334
Nice fresh morning.

33:56.335 --> 34:00.771
That dog is happy.

34:00.772 --> 34:07.678
The great chef loves this
place, and you can see why.

34:07.679 --> 34:12.850
♪

34:12.851 --> 34:18.022
Monsuer Paul can't safely
hunt but is happy to chase

34:18.023 --> 34:26.023
around flushing birds for us.

34:29.501 --> 34:29.967
Beautiful.

34:29.969 --> 34:31.335
Yeah, it is beautiful.

34:31.337 --> 34:37.875
I could do this all day.

34:37.876 --> 34:45.876
That was about as good
as we're going to get.

34:46.252 --> 34:49.053
If you look long enough,
you start hallucinating.

34:49.054 --> 34:54.824
You start hallucinating ducks
where there aren't any.

34:54.826 --> 34:59.029
You see that one falling?

34:59.030 --> 35:00.565
Okay, not a moment to waste.

35:00.566 --> 35:07.004
Quickly, a second shot.

35:07.005 --> 35:07.206
Okay.

35:07.207 --> 35:10.741
You got it?

35:10.742 --> 35:11.009
Yeah.

35:11.010 --> 35:17.248
Right there.

35:17.249 --> 35:19.517
Between me and Daniel and the

35:19.518 --> 35:22.353
dog, we managed to
actually bag a few ducks.

35:22.354 --> 35:29.694
Good job.

35:29.695 --> 35:29.961
Very good.

35:29.962 --> 35:32.530
Easy shot.

35:32.531 --> 35:35.132
Then it's back to the lodge,

35:35.133 --> 35:37.134
clearly Paul's happy place,
where we meet up with some

35:37.135 --> 35:39.370
hunting buddies of
the great chef.

35:39.371 --> 35:41.772
You did a good job, no?

35:41.773 --> 35:42.773
Success.

35:42.774 --> 35:46.744
Yeah.

35:46.745 --> 35:54.385
It's fantastic.

35:54.386 --> 35:56.153
Is this the hunting lodge,

35:56.154 --> 35:58.289
the weekend getaway,
hang out with the guys?

35:58.290 --> 36:06.290
That's where he comes
every day, almost.

36:09.468 --> 36:10.735
Look at the picture behind.

36:10.736 --> 36:18.736
You see?

36:19.077 --> 36:21.946
For tonight's meal, we pluck

36:21.947 --> 36:26.016
and roast some woodcocks
over an open fire.

36:26.017 --> 36:34.017
Cook up some well-aged
duck and pheasant.

36:34.293 --> 36:42.293
They make mashed potato here.

36:42.501 --> 36:43.701
There a head in there somewhere?

36:43.702 --> 36:48.339
Yes, of course.

36:48.340 --> 36:56.340
That's happiness right there.

36:57.649 --> 37:01.852
I am a man of simple needs.

37:01.853 --> 37:08.393
And I notice... we can
spend the whole week

37:08.394 --> 37:11.161
and we'll be hunting, we'll be

37:11.162 --> 37:14.164
cooking, eating, drinking, and

37:14.165 --> 37:22.165
talking and that's beautiful.

37:25.744 --> 37:29.714
It is for me a dream to spend
this time with a legend.

37:29.715 --> 37:33.150
But I'm thrilled that Beaucoup

37:33.151 --> 37:41.151
himself seems delighted.

37:42.260 --> 37:46.697
In Lyonnes, he's the great chef,

37:46.698 --> 37:50.234
a public figure, a
hero, an institution.

37:50.235 --> 37:52.837
Always treated with the
greatest deference.

37:52.838 --> 37:54.204
Here it appear he's free to

37:54.205 --> 37:56.707
enjoy the simple things with

37:56.708 --> 37:57.942
friends, local farmers who talk

37:57.943 --> 38:02.112
to him like anybody else.

38:02.113 --> 38:06.452
It's a pretty damn
magical thing to see.

38:21.800 --> 38:23.801
Daniel might be a 3
star Michelin chef but

38:23.802 --> 38:26.637
like so many of his
predecessors, he's basically a

38:26.638 --> 38:27.473
farm boy.

38:27.474 --> 38:30.140
He grew up milking cows and

38:30.141 --> 38:32.276
doing farm work here on
his family's spread.

38:32.277 --> 38:35.980
There is as it turns out,
something of a restaurant

38:35.981 --> 38:36.815
tradition to build on.

38:36.816 --> 38:39.116
The house on his farm was once a

38:39.117 --> 38:40.985
cafe as well, operated first by

38:40.986 --> 38:44.589
his grandparents and
great grandparents.

38:44.590 --> 38:49.894
The famous cafe Boulou was not

38:49.895 --> 38:52.096
the first place to
keep that name.

38:52.097 --> 38:53.831
That kept it for 80 years,

38:53.832 --> 39:01.832
100 year, then they closed it.

39:09.748 --> 39:11.449
Meeting hi dad, one seems to

39:11.450 --> 39:17.622
understand the roots
of his perfectionism.

39:17.623 --> 39:25.623
His mom, dad, wife Katherine and

39:26.364 --> 39:27.598
Danielle collaborate
with some debate.

39:27.599 --> 39:30.635
On a super old school
farmhouse classic.

39:30.636 --> 39:32.369
The sort of things good times,

39:32.370 --> 39:34.338
bad times, a family could make

39:34.339 --> 39:37.374
with stuff always readily
available on the farm.

39:37.375 --> 39:38.276
Check this out.

39:38.277 --> 39:41.345
It's a hollowed out pumpkin

39:41.346 --> 39:45.450
layered with toasted chunkses of

39:45.451 --> 39:49.019
stale bread, nutmeg, grated

39:49.020 --> 39:50.621
cheese, mushrooms, fresh cream

39:50.622 --> 39:54.158
from the cows and the
meat of the pumpkin.

39:54.159 --> 40:00.465
And a layer of bacon also.

40:00.466 --> 40:08.466
Oh, man, it's heavy.

40:08.907 --> 40:10.340
Are you concerned the pumpkin

40:10.341 --> 40:13.644
is go I think to try to get out?

40:13.645 --> 40:21.645
His dad can be a bit of a
mcgooi mcelhi McGyver.

40:24.255 --> 40:29.059
You don't waste stuff and
he's a bit of an inventor.

40:29.060 --> 40:37.060
An old washing machine
turned still.

40:41.406 --> 40:47.545
To seal it so there's
no air coming in.

40:47.546 --> 40:50.080
Leftover grape solids usually

40:50.081 --> 40:58.081
used to be make liquor,
today a different use.

40:58.256 --> 40:59.057
If we can get it out of here.

40:59.058 --> 41:07.058
Why did you put so
much cement on it?

41:10.936 --> 41:13.638
We'll be using this delightfully

41:13.639 --> 41:16.073
funky stuff to flavor the steam

41:16.074 --> 41:24.074
that cooks the vegetables
from inside the still.

41:24.916 --> 41:31.421
Then we come back in an hour.

41:31.422 --> 41:35.626
At Dutinsk we settle for dinner.

41:35.627 --> 41:37.461
Look at that.

41:37.462 --> 41:38.596
Ion credible.

41:38.597 --> 41:38.964
Look at that.

41:38.965 --> 41:41.065
Wow.

41:41.066 --> 41:42.967
The pumpkin is amazing.

41:42.968 --> 41:47.071
We also have that great sausage.

41:47.072 --> 41:51.942
Oh, look at that.

41:51.943 --> 41:56.013
Cabbage and potatoes, all
steamed in the still.

41:56.014 --> 41:58.182
The flavor you get from the
fermented grape, awesome.

41:58.183 --> 41:58.383
Good.

41:58.384 --> 42:00.484
So good.

42:00.485 --> 42:03.588
As you know Danielle can't
really help himself.

42:03.589 --> 42:04.822
He's popping up and down,

42:04.823 --> 42:05.990
serving everybody, making sure

42:05.991 --> 42:07.858
everything is just right.

42:07.859 --> 42:09.026
Sitting here with his family in

42:09.027 --> 42:10.527
the house he grew up in, you can

42:10.528 --> 42:18.202
see where it all comes from.

42:18.203 --> 42:22.172
Their son is now a gigantic
international success.

42:22.173 --> 42:23.708
When he was a young man at 14

42:23.709 --> 42:30.448
sneezing in the field, did
they ever anticipate this?

42:35.654 --> 42:35.921
We do.

42:35.922 --> 42:38.989
They all reflect the
region hopefully.

42:38.990 --> 42:40.190
But in the best case,
they're interdependent.

42:40.191 --> 42:42.827
They come from each other.

42:42.828 --> 42:45.429
In fact, who cooks in
the great restaurants?

42:45.430 --> 42:47.564
Farm boys basically.

42:47.565 --> 42:48.633
That's who always cooked.

42:48.634 --> 42:50.567
My deepest thanks to your
mother an your father.

42:50.568 --> 42:51.069
Thank you.

42:51.070 --> 42:52.803
Merci.

42:52.804 --> 42:56.642
Next time my father will
make you drive the tractor.
