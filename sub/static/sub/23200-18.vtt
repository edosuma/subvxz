00:48.056 --> 00:52.102
Under our congressional charter,
we must inform your agency of any...

00:52.185 --> 00:55.313
potentially catastrophic consequences
in our research.

00:55.438 --> 00:58.275
Dr. Roberts, it makes me shudder
just to say it...

00:58.358 --> 01:01.611
but it sounds like you're talking about
germ warfare.

01:01.695 --> 01:05.072
Precisely why your Col. Trevor
wanted you informed.

01:05.740 --> 01:10.078
Actually, Miss Prince, it began
as part of our anti-germ warfare efforts.

01:11.746 --> 01:15.083
But something went wrong.
And now we've got-

01:15.166 --> 01:18.378
Potentially catastrophic consequences.

01:25.218 --> 01:29.722
If you don't mind, I'd like to see
what could cause those consequences.

01:42.902 --> 01:44.362
In a hurry, George?

01:58.292 --> 02:00.002
It's a totally new virus.

02:00.086 --> 02:03.381
Slimy green byproduct
of our artificial microbe program.

02:03.464 --> 02:04.799
Harmless in a vacuum.

02:04.882 --> 02:09.345
But when airborne, it attacks host tissue
and destroys red cells.

02:40.209 --> 02:42.461
Death is almost instantaneous.

02:43.003 --> 02:44.213
- Death?
- Yes.

02:44.630 --> 02:48.467
Two weeks ago, five of my colleagues
found out the hard way.

02:49.051 --> 02:52.221
Potentially catastrophic consequences.

02:52.304 --> 02:56.016
Until we find an antidote,
no living creature is truly safe.

03:02.314 --> 03:05.192
As you can see,
few people have access to...

03:06.485 --> 03:09.113
Good Lord. It's gone!

04:36.282 --> 04:39.744
What are you doing with the virus?
Wait. George!

04:48.211 --> 04:51.673
- Stop that man!
- Hold it right there. I'll drop you.

04:52.507 --> 04:55.051
Don't shoot. Now calm down, George.

04:58.805 --> 05:02.433
Please, don't shoot! Or we'll all be sorry.

05:03.768 --> 05:07.188
In that test tube are deadly pathogens.

05:07.313 --> 05:10.316
If he drops the vial and the seal breaks...

05:10.817 --> 05:13.903
every human being within 3 miles will die.

05:16.614 --> 05:17.824
She's right.

05:18.908 --> 05:22.870
Put your gun down. Please put it back.

05:25.289 --> 05:27.333
We've worked together
assisting Dr. Roberts...

05:27.416 --> 05:29.418
for over two years now.

05:29.543 --> 05:33.214
You're jeopardizing
hundreds of thousands of lives.

05:33.297 --> 05:36.634
Innocent people. Think of them.

08:45.988 --> 08:48.365
I'd be curious to know its composition.

08:48.449 --> 08:53.037
- Could be our best lead.
- Doctor, it's our only lead.

08:53.245 --> 08:56.373
Poor George.
What do you think has happened to him?

08:58.876 --> 09:02.046
Here is the Royal Beach Hotel, George.

09:03.047 --> 09:06.550
This is where you spent two wonderful...

09:06.634 --> 09:09.929
fun-filled days and nights, George.

09:10.512 --> 09:15.142
It's where you met Claudine, George.

09:15.225 --> 09:18.020
This is Claudine.

09:18.645 --> 09:22.983
You fell in love, George. With Claudine.

09:26.695 --> 09:30.199
You'll do anything for Claudine.

09:30.949 --> 09:33.577
Anything, George.

09:34.286 --> 09:37.581
Claudine wants you to escape.

09:37.664 --> 09:40.584
And, if necessary, die...

09:41.210 --> 09:46.131
if anyone tries to give you truth serum.

09:47.424 --> 09:49.593
Truth serum.

09:54.681 --> 09:58.935
Die. Truth serum.

10:10.197 --> 10:13.825
Live it up, George, while you can.

10:15.785 --> 10:17.871
Where's the old lady, Mrs. Thrip?

10:17.954 --> 10:19.789
She's been sent her free offer.

10:19.873 --> 10:23.668
Follow that up with a phone call.
I want her simulated. This afternoon.

10:23.752 --> 10:25.170
Yes, sir.

10:30.592 --> 10:32.927
No. There's no way an imposter...

10:33.011 --> 10:35.221
could have got through
the routine security check.

10:35.305 --> 10:38.475
Unless he duplicated George's fingerprints
as well as his face.

10:38.558 --> 10:39.893
Not improbable, Colonel.

10:39.976 --> 10:42.729
Considering the advanced technology
that created the mask.

10:42.812 --> 10:44.647
Advanced technology?

10:44.981 --> 10:47.567
To me that suggests foreign agents.

10:47.650 --> 10:50.111
Or a big terrorist organization.

10:50.195 --> 10:51.529
How about extortion?

10:51.613 --> 10:54.490
With that killer virus,
he could hold the entire population...

10:54.574 --> 10:57.076
of Washington, D.C. for ransom.

10:57.160 --> 11:00.246
Let's rule out money as a motive,
for the time being.

11:00.330 --> 11:02.248
All right, but why?

11:02.332 --> 11:05.335
If they have the ability
to duplicate other people...

11:05.418 --> 11:07.879
and they were really
after some big bucks...

11:07.962 --> 11:11.007
they could find
a lot less risky ways of doing it.

11:11.090 --> 11:12.467
True enough.

11:12.550 --> 11:14.719
And as long as they have no antidote...

11:14.802 --> 11:17.805
their lives are in jeopardy,
same as everyone else.

11:19.515 --> 11:21.267
Excuse me, Dr. Roberts.

11:21.350 --> 11:23.644
Prof. Zander's returning your calls.

11:23.728 --> 11:26.147
Speaking of antidotes. Thank you, Dede.

11:29.734 --> 11:31.402
Professor. Have you found an antidote?

11:31.485 --> 11:33.029
Of course not!

11:33.112 --> 11:37.658
How can I, when you keep interrupting me
with these incessant phone calls?

11:48.169 --> 11:50.629
And Roberts, these IADC agents...

11:50.713 --> 11:54.300
have kept me virtually a prisoner
for the last two weeks.

11:54.467 --> 11:58.137
They're safeguarding you and your work,
not holding you prisoner.

11:59.138 --> 12:01.015
Can't you get rid of them?

12:01.098 --> 12:02.183
Afraid not, Zander.

12:02.266 --> 12:04.268
You're our best hope
of finding an antidote...

12:04.351 --> 12:06.270
and we don't want anything
to happen to you.

12:06.353 --> 12:08.272
I'm leaving now, Professor.

12:08.355 --> 12:11.400
But shouldn't you consider my morale?

12:11.483 --> 12:12.985
It's my afternoon off.

12:13.068 --> 12:15.321
- Your morale?
- Yes!

12:15.404 --> 12:19.074
How would you like it if the only person
you were permitted to see was...

12:19.158 --> 12:21.827
Mary Jane Thrip?

12:51.189 --> 12:52.566
Excuse me.

12:54.401 --> 12:57.195
This came in the mail.

12:57.779 --> 13:00.198
The free offer?

13:00.282 --> 13:04.244
Of course, in an ordinary way
I wouldn't follow up anything like that.

13:04.494 --> 13:07.330
But the young person
who called me today...

13:07.456 --> 13:10.500
sounded so sweet and concerned-

13:11.042 --> 13:13.378
You are Mrs. Thrip!

13:14.546 --> 13:16.256
I was the one who called you.

13:16.339 --> 13:21.219
We were hoping you'd show.
Welcome to Data-Date Compu-Cupid.

13:21.386 --> 13:24.764
If you'll just follow me, please.

13:29.477 --> 13:32.564
What we're gonna do
is put you in front of a TV camera in there.

13:32.647 --> 13:35.317
I'm going to be on TV?

13:35.567 --> 13:36.609
Videotape, sweetheart.

13:36.693 --> 13:39.738
It's not like
being on Johnny Carson or anything.

13:41.698 --> 13:44.909
You're going to give
a little spiel about yourself.

13:44.993 --> 13:49.038
Then we take your tape,
feed it to the computer along with your...

13:49.122 --> 13:52.792
vital statistics, the computer
matches you up to someone...

13:52.876 --> 13:56.588
he sees your tape,
and the rest could be history.

13:57.422 --> 14:01.259
Do you suppose your computer
has a line on Burt Reynolds?

14:04.762 --> 14:06.180
She's all ready.

14:19.152 --> 14:20.695
Now just take a seat.

14:23.114 --> 14:26.451
Remember. Say what you really feel...

14:26.534 --> 14:30.496
on account the men watching your tape
wanna know the real you.

14:35.418 --> 14:39.922
Just relax, and keep your hands flat
on the green markings, please.

14:45.928 --> 14:50.766
Your Data-Date Compu-Cupid presents...

14:59.817 --> 15:02.695
I'm Mrs. Mary Jane Thrip.

15:03.612 --> 15:05.865
The "Mrs. " stands for widow.

15:05.948 --> 15:08.659
I'm a professional housekeeper.

15:09.034 --> 15:13.497
People say that I'm exactly
as old as I look.

15:14.290 --> 15:17.334
There goes my chance with John Travolta.

15:17.960 --> 15:20.129
I would just like to say...

15:20.212 --> 15:24.508
that I only agreed to do this
on account ofit being free.

15:25.134 --> 15:27.720
My mother was Scottish, you see.

15:32.641 --> 15:36.186
She kept her life savings in a sock...

15:36.270 --> 15:40.482
Which she put around the plumbing...

15:40.566 --> 15:43.277
under the bathroom sink...

15:43.360 --> 15:47.322
so that the burglars would think
it was an old leaky pipe.

15:50.576 --> 15:52.995
Is it all right to say "bathroom "?

15:55.872 --> 15:57.624
Bite your tongue.

16:00.168 --> 16:01.670
How am I doing?

16:05.674 --> 16:08.343
Of course, being a widow...

16:08.427 --> 16:11.096
one is lonely sometimes.

16:11.179 --> 16:14.975
Especially after I give Prof. Zander...

16:15.308 --> 16:19.896
his rum, peanut butter,
and sausage soufflé...

16:19.980 --> 16:22.357
in his study.

16:22.440 --> 16:25.902
He will not do without his soufflé.

16:25.986 --> 16:30.198
My recipes have a wee bit of something
for everybody.

16:31.116 --> 16:33.827
Then I go back to the kitchen...

16:33.910 --> 16:37.372
Where I have to sip
my warm milk all alone.

16:38.415 --> 16:42.836
But I want to be
perfectly candid on one point.

16:42.919 --> 16:46.506
My gate may be a little rusted...

16:46.589 --> 16:51.219
but it can still swing, if you get my drift.

16:51.845 --> 16:53.430
Another swinger.

16:54.055 --> 16:55.723
How's it going?

16:57.851 --> 16:59.519
Look for yourself.

17:08.236 --> 17:13.156
You just come back tomorrow
and we'll have a hot prospect for you.

17:13.491 --> 17:15.535
Hope it's Burt Reynolds.

17:16.953 --> 17:18.746
Tomorrow.

17:22.125 --> 17:23.334
They look perfect.

17:23.417 --> 17:26.462
They are perfect.
Down to the last fingerprint.

17:32.844 --> 17:35.763
Sorry, but there is no record
of you being on any flight...

17:35.847 --> 17:38.599
to Miami, the Bahamas, or anywhere.

17:38.683 --> 17:41.060
Your Gestapo forces
pounced on me at the airport.

17:41.143 --> 17:43.521
- I had to have been on a plane.
- George?

17:43.855 --> 17:47.692
We checked into the Royal Beach Hotel
where you claim to have stayed.

17:47.775 --> 17:49.402
Negative.

17:51.487 --> 17:54.615
Ask Claudine, she'll tell you.

17:55.408 --> 17:57.243
Where is Claudine, George?

17:57.326 --> 17:58.869
Well, she's in...

18:00.287 --> 18:02.790
There's no Flight 27, no hotel...

18:02.873 --> 18:04.625
And no Claudine.

18:07.294 --> 18:10.089
I was there, I know it. And so was she.

18:10.172 --> 18:12.091
But where is "there," George?

18:12.174 --> 18:13.551
In Florida.

18:13.843 --> 18:16.637
Florida? Then where's your tan?

18:20.432 --> 18:22.726
Incredible job of brainwashing.

18:23.894 --> 18:24.979
Brainwashing?

18:25.062 --> 18:27.982
Do you have any objection
to taking a truth serum?

18:28.148 --> 18:29.358
Truth serum?

18:29.441 --> 18:31.318
Yeah. Sodium pentothal.

18:31.402 --> 18:33.070
It's a simple injection.

18:33.320 --> 18:35.489
Truth serum? No.

18:35.864 --> 18:37.825
Good, then maybe
we can clear this thing up.

18:37.908 --> 18:40.494
It'll take just a minute. Wait a minute!

18:40.577 --> 18:43.497
Let's go to the stairway.
You go up, I'll go down.

18:56.426 --> 18:57.511
George!

19:28.250 --> 19:30.544
Escape, or die.

19:31.586 --> 19:33.797
You're gonna be all right.

19:48.812 --> 19:50.271
Mrs. Thrip.

19:59.197 --> 20:01.491
She couldn't appreciate it anyway.

20:12.210 --> 20:15.338
Dr. Roberts, Prof. Zander's
on the phone for you.

20:26.057 --> 20:30.061
Mind you, it hasn't been tested yet
but I'm 100% certain...

20:30.144 --> 20:33.147
that I have found the antidote.

20:33.773 --> 20:37.819
Professor, may the Nobel Prize
fly in your window!

20:40.988 --> 20:43.574
I accept.

20:44.075 --> 20:45.910
Now just leave the testing to us.

20:45.993 --> 20:47.161
My pleasure.

20:47.245 --> 20:48.829
I'll inform the IADC.

20:48.913 --> 20:52.416
They'll dispatch an agent
to pick up the antidote right away.

20:56.796 --> 20:59.924
Here I am, checking out the hot prospect...

21:00.007 --> 21:02.593
you called and said you had for me.

21:02.677 --> 21:07.181
Just a sec, hon. Data-Date Compu-Cupid.

21:07.264 --> 21:09.767
Don't wait for a mate, call Data-Date.

21:09.850 --> 21:12.228
This is urgent. Put ward on.

21:12.812 --> 21:15.189
One moment, please.

21:15.689 --> 21:17.942
If you'll direct your attention
to the screen...

21:18.025 --> 21:21.362
your gentleman respondee
will appear for your examination.

21:34.750 --> 21:36.961
- Yeah?
- Call for you.

21:38.963 --> 21:41.340
- Hello.
- Are you ready?

21:41.423 --> 21:42.633
Almost.

21:42.758 --> 21:45.844
Almost isn't good enough.
You've got to move now.

21:45.928 --> 21:47.805
Zander's found the antidote.

21:47.888 --> 21:52.684
Your Data-Date Compu-Cupid presents...

21:53.143 --> 21:56.605
I ride a 900cc motorcycle,
and I'm looking for a little buckaroo...

21:56.688 --> 21:58.148
to share my saddle.

21:58.232 --> 22:01.693
Ask for Burt Reynolds
and you get Gabby Hayes.

22:03.695 --> 22:06.949
That's great news. Thank you, Doctor.

22:12.287 --> 22:15.540
The agency psychologist
isn't having any more luck than we did.

22:15.624 --> 22:20.504
I didn't wanna force the truth serum idea
because George was reacting so violently.

22:20.587 --> 22:22.506
I thought we'd better hold off.

22:22.589 --> 22:25.217
No problem. I just got word
from Dr. Roberts.

22:25.300 --> 22:26.510
The antidote.

22:26.593 --> 22:31.181
Zander did it. But I don't want
to take any chances. Not now.

22:31.848 --> 22:32.974
So...

22:34.351 --> 22:38.563
You want little old me to get over there
and deliver it to the testing lab.

22:39.231 --> 22:41.233
You're my best man.

22:42.776 --> 22:45.028
Thanks for the compliment.

22:47.948 --> 22:50.408
I like all kinds as long as they're young.

22:50.492 --> 22:53.203
No snow on the roof,
with a nice front porch.

22:53.536 --> 22:56.539
Solid foundation. Shingles in good shape...

22:56.706 --> 22:59.209
and a fresh fire in the furnace.

23:00.335 --> 23:03.922
He's not looking for a companion,
he wants a house.

23:04.005 --> 23:06.424
I'm no stranger to this game, no sir.

23:06.508 --> 23:10.470
I guess if this little speech of mine
was going in the papers instead of on TV...

23:10.553 --> 23:14.516
right by my name, they'd put
"experienced, "with a capital "X"...

23:14.599 --> 23:16.100
if you know what I mean.

23:24.817 --> 23:27.070
- Hat.
- Right here.

23:32.116 --> 23:33.576
How do I look?

23:33.660 --> 23:35.161
Great.

23:35.244 --> 23:39.040
We'd better take care of that housekeeper.
We don't want her wandering off.

23:39.123 --> 23:43.503
Not to worry. She's about to go
on a South American tour.

23:44.796 --> 23:46.047
Carry on.

23:53.930 --> 23:57.558
And now, Mrs. Thrip, we have...

23:57.642 --> 24:01.062
a surprise for you.

24:01.812 --> 24:03.898
The old bag's gone.

25:15.677 --> 25:17.304
Mrs. Thrip!

25:18.263 --> 25:21.099
You are beautiful.

25:21.808 --> 25:25.562
Thanks to you, I have found the antidote.

25:25.645 --> 25:28.565
Those soufflés you always made me,
which I professed to love?

25:28.648 --> 25:30.817
Sausage, peanut butter.

25:30.901 --> 25:33.820
I can't stand them, never could.

25:33.945 --> 25:37.032
In fact, I hid them...

25:37.240 --> 25:41.536
until they were covered with mold.

25:42.454 --> 25:45.832
And it was that mold...

25:46.666 --> 25:49.794
which led me to this.

25:51.379 --> 25:52.923
The antidote.

25:54.758 --> 25:57.177
Thank you.

26:02.474 --> 26:05.101
And thank you, Professor.

26:38.217 --> 26:39.594
Hi, guys.

26:42.263 --> 26:44.390
Where's the Professor?

26:58.821 --> 27:02.074
Professor! What happened?

27:02.658 --> 27:04.118
Are you all right?

27:06.495 --> 27:07.705
Mrs. Thrip.

27:11.208 --> 27:12.543
She's a he!

27:16.422 --> 27:19.425
- And he's got the antidote!
- Oh, no.

27:21.302 --> 27:23.220
Take care of him, would you?

27:25.306 --> 27:27.141
Kurt, Baker! Stop that man!

27:29.602 --> 27:30.895
Woman.

27:48.287 --> 27:49.830
Cut her off.

28:35.125 --> 28:36.460
Doubling back?

28:40.338 --> 28:41.965
Thank you for the tip.

29:20.753 --> 29:23.506
My stars! Wait!

30:12.179 --> 30:13.681
That's far enough.

30:14.140 --> 30:17.310
Okay, mister, just hand over the antidote.

30:17.685 --> 30:19.729
Don't you "mister" me!

30:20.896 --> 30:23.816
It's bad enough being mistaken
for a house!

30:34.785 --> 30:36.912
And so your double, whoever that is...

30:36.996 --> 30:39.248
got away with something
that is extremely vital...

30:39.331 --> 30:41.083
to the safety of the entire world?

30:41.167 --> 30:43.252
The Professor's antidote.

30:43.335 --> 30:47.506
- You know about that?
- Oh, yes, he tells me everything.

30:48.841 --> 30:50.759
Even about security matters?

30:50.926 --> 30:52.428
The killer virus?

30:54.847 --> 30:58.100
But he makes me promise
to keep a button on my lip.

30:59.518 --> 31:03.147
Like when I was telling the dating agency.

31:03.397 --> 31:07.067
I said, "My life is...

31:07.151 --> 31:10.821
"somewhat lonely,
except for the Professor. "

31:15.033 --> 31:16.535
Anything wrong?

31:16.618 --> 31:19.705
No. Did you say dating agency?

31:19.788 --> 31:24.459
Yes. I got a free offer
from the Data-Date Compu-Cupid.

31:24.793 --> 31:26.795
Diana, correct me if I'm wrong, but-

31:26.878 --> 31:31.466
Yes. George also had a free offer
from Compu-Cupid.

31:32.134 --> 31:35.303
That's the last thing he remembered.
Come on...

31:35.637 --> 31:37.431
a computer dating service?

31:37.806 --> 31:40.809
Well, Steve, the imposter
already has the antidote.

31:41.268 --> 31:45.564
We are running short on time, so
let's be grateful for any lead we can get.

31:46.648 --> 31:49.693
Maybe Ira can give us
the inside track that we need.

31:51.319 --> 31:54.406
- Where are you going?
- Oh, well...

31:55.198 --> 31:57.534
my social life has been really lousy lately.

31:57.617 --> 32:00.245
I think it's time I did something about it.

32:00.495 --> 32:03.665
Why don't you try one of those
computer dating agencies?

32:04.332 --> 32:08.336
That's a very good idea, Steve.
How clever of you.

32:08.670 --> 32:10.714
- It's nothing.
- Sure.

32:10.839 --> 32:14.175
A lovely thing like you,
you might get lucky...

32:14.259 --> 32:17.053
and make a date with an antidote.

32:23.685 --> 32:26.020
Mr. Bunny has been given
the antidote, check?

32:26.104 --> 32:29.149
Check. Go ahead and add the virus.

32:44.122 --> 32:46.207
I hope he stays a happy hare.

32:51.838 --> 32:54.006
This is what I call a rabbit test.

32:58.052 --> 33:00.012
Death should be instantaneous.

33:08.813 --> 33:11.232
The antidote worked. He's safe.

33:13.859 --> 33:15.236
Congratulations.

33:19.156 --> 33:22.994
It's too bad we can't say the same
for the rest of the world.

33:23.828 --> 33:27.623
- When will our delivery boy be delivered?
- This afternoon.

33:33.003 --> 33:36.924
The Compu-Cupid computer
is not part of any known data network.

33:37.591 --> 33:39.260
Can you patch into it anyway?

33:39.343 --> 33:42.888
Steve Trevor, that is a complex,
time-consuming function...

33:42.972 --> 33:44.849
With no certain outcome.

33:44.932 --> 33:47.393
In other words, you're not sure
but you'll try. Right?

33:47.476 --> 33:49.103
- Affirmative.
- Good.

33:49.186 --> 33:51.730
Get started, Ira.
Lots of lives may depend on this.

33:52.523 --> 33:55.442
Don't tell me
you have trouble getting dates.

33:56.193 --> 33:57.945
Well, no, not really.

33:58.404 --> 34:01.156
I just seem to end up
with the wrong guy, know what I mean?

34:01.240 --> 34:04.576
- Yeah, is there a right kind?
- Well, one can always hope.

34:04.743 --> 34:06.954
Don't tell me, are you my freebie?

34:07.037 --> 34:11.041
All right! They call me John Blake,
"The Snake on the Make. "

34:11.958 --> 34:13.252
Freebie?

34:13.418 --> 34:17.880
Oh! You're Mr. Blake!
Mr. Blake, our lucky sweepstakes winner.

34:17.965 --> 34:20.425
Are we gonna find a mate for you, sir.

34:20.509 --> 34:23.428
Right this way.
We're ready for you in Studio 1.

34:23.554 --> 34:24.972
This way.

34:26.264 --> 34:27.891
I've got the feeling...

34:27.975 --> 34:31.143
that "The Snake on the Make"
could be Mr. Right.

34:32.020 --> 34:34.773
What it is, it is. Whoa. I'm him! Really.

34:34.856 --> 34:37.609
- You sure are. But is she her?
- Yeah!

34:44.032 --> 34:46.868
Yes. I need to know all about you.

34:47.828 --> 34:49.621
"Snake on the Make. "

34:51.706 --> 34:53.708
Now, right this way.

34:53.792 --> 34:55.585
He might be the one, maybe I should just-

34:55.668 --> 34:59.172
We've got procedures here
and you've got a videotape to make.

34:59.256 --> 35:01.216
- A what?
- A videotape!

35:01.633 --> 35:04.970
In here. Oh, they'll love you.

35:12.811 --> 35:15.063
- Is ward in the control room?
- Maybe.

35:16.481 --> 35:18.692
What's the matter? Don't tell me...

35:18.817 --> 35:21.861
you've stopped keeping track
of his every move.

35:22.570 --> 35:24.072
You're real cute.

35:24.322 --> 35:26.408
Must be the reason
why Ward dropped me...

35:26.491 --> 35:29.953
like a lit firecracker
when you came through the door.

35:30.328 --> 35:33.581
No, I think it was because he was bored.

35:36.251 --> 35:38.086
Oh, yeah, that's right.

35:38.503 --> 35:41.339
You stimulate his intellect, don't you?

35:41.881 --> 35:44.342
Don't knock it until you've tried it.

35:44.425 --> 35:47.345
Here's something
to stimulate your intellect.

35:47.470 --> 35:50.473
I'm sticking around here, sister.
You know why?

35:51.057 --> 35:54.978
Because one day
you're gonna be that lit firecracker.

35:55.436 --> 35:58.356
And I intend to be here to enjoy...

35:58.481 --> 36:00.942
the big bang.

36:03.236 --> 36:05.613
My advise to you
is to get yourself in there...

36:05.696 --> 36:07.365
in front of those cameras...

36:07.448 --> 36:09.033
and cross your fingers.

36:09.117 --> 36:13.120
Because it sounds to me like you're going
to be here for quite a while.

36:17.708 --> 36:19.752
- How do you feel?
- Invulnerable.

36:19.835 --> 36:23.005
Good. I don't know how long
the antidote will last...

36:23.089 --> 36:25.549
so I suggest we make our move
this afternoon.

36:25.633 --> 36:26.968
No problem.

36:27.885 --> 36:31.013
- Is that our delivery boy?
- He doesn't look like much.

36:31.514 --> 36:34.642
But by the end of the day,
he will have become famous.

36:35.559 --> 36:36.894
Infamous.

36:38.270 --> 36:40.564
"The Snake on the Make" to my friends.

36:40.648 --> 36:44.485
Among whom I hope to count you
before too long. Know what I mean?

36:45.903 --> 36:48.405
Anyway, I fly a helicopter for a living.

36:48.948 --> 36:50.074
As a matter of fact...

36:50.157 --> 36:52.910
I'm one of the very few pilots
licensed to fly a chopper...

36:52.993 --> 36:56.080
over our nation's
most sacred monuments and buildings.

36:56.455 --> 37:00.751
I take tourists on aerial tours
of this great big capital city of ours.

37:01.335 --> 37:04.672
Like this afternoon,
I started out at Dulles Airport...

37:04.755 --> 37:07.007
picked up a half a dozen good folk.

37:07.466 --> 37:09.468
Passed a triple security check.

37:09.551 --> 37:12.763
Then I cruised my good folks southward
down the Potomac River...

37:12.846 --> 37:14.848
to the Navy Yard and then north.

37:14.932 --> 37:17.101
I show them where history's made.

37:17.226 --> 37:19.603
The Capitol building, Library of Congress...

37:19.686 --> 37:22.898
Constitution Hall, National Gallery,
Capitol Hill.

37:23.232 --> 37:27.861
And finally, a run up Pennsylvania Avenue
to the greatest thrill of them all:

37:28.070 --> 37:30.948
The White House!
I mean, you haven't lived...

37:31.031 --> 37:34.535
until you've looked into
the White House windows at 300 feet.

37:34.785 --> 37:36.370
The White House, man.

37:54.721 --> 37:57.682
You looking for me, Rover?
What you got there?

38:01.728 --> 38:06.149
Your boss just made contact
with Compu-Cupid. Lead the way.

38:14.908 --> 38:17.619
You, my dear, are a genius.

38:17.702 --> 38:19.454
My genius would be a total waste...

38:19.537 --> 38:22.707
were it not for your genius
in putting it to use.

38:24.292 --> 38:27.879
Shall we get "The Snake on the Make"
started on his vacation?

38:29.422 --> 38:31.466
It looks like you've got another customer.

38:31.549 --> 38:34.427
- Better get rid of her first.
- Diana Prince!

38:35.053 --> 38:37.722
She's an IADC agent.
She was in the lab with Roberts.

38:37.806 --> 38:41.309
- The day you stole the virus, remember?
- She must be on to us.

38:41.768 --> 38:44.103
- Get rid of her.
- Wait a minute.

38:44.187 --> 38:48.358
Are you sure the simulation
of an IADC agent wouldn't come in handy?

38:49.817 --> 38:51.152
Perhaps.

38:52.320 --> 38:55.615
Especially a dead IADC agent.

39:05.124 --> 39:06.417
Hi.

39:06.918 --> 39:09.754
My name is Jessica Abernathy.

39:09.837 --> 39:13.508
The Compu-Cupid computer
is programmed for two basic functions.

39:13.591 --> 39:16.135
As a database
for dissemination of information...

39:16.219 --> 39:18.137
regarding persons
seeking companionship...

39:18.221 --> 39:20.598
With members of the opposite sex.

39:20.681 --> 39:22.308
- A dating service?
- Affirmative.

39:22.391 --> 39:25.102
Why didn't you say so? Go on.

39:25.853 --> 39:29.190
Also as a patented data simulator
specializing in...

39:29.273 --> 39:33.194
the 3-dimensional duplication
of specific human characteristics.

39:33.986 --> 39:36.947
That's where they've been making
the masks and gloves.

39:37.031 --> 39:41.494
Ira, can you identify the people
most recently simulated by Compu-Cupid?

39:41.577 --> 39:43.537
- Naturally.
- Good.

39:46.832 --> 39:49.668
We've got to find out what they plan to do
with that virus.

39:49.752 --> 39:52.004
Mrs. Mary Jane Thrip.

39:52.797 --> 39:55.549
- After her.
- One John Blake.

39:57.051 --> 39:59.720
- Okay, who else?
- One Diana Prince.

40:00.721 --> 40:01.847
Diana?

40:04.892 --> 40:08.187
This is Col. Trevor.
I need a car out front. Immediately!

40:09.939 --> 40:12.191
It really was love at first sight...

40:12.274 --> 40:15.319
thanks to Compu-Cupid.

40:16.528 --> 40:20.532
Actually I met him right outside,
the minute I walked through the door.

40:21.283 --> 40:26.038
Thanks to Compu-Cupid, love at first sight
is gonna be a real gas, lady.

40:27.122 --> 40:31.084
Maybe I've talked enough
about John Blake.

40:33.170 --> 40:35.380
Maybe I should talk about myself.

40:40.177 --> 40:42.387
Oh, my gosh! we've got a fire here.

40:43.096 --> 40:44.765
You better call the fire department.

40:47.601 --> 40:49.102
Sweet dreams, baby.

40:54.107 --> 40:55.525
How does it look?

40:57.778 --> 41:00.113
Good enough to fool airport security
at Dulles.

41:00.197 --> 41:02.449
Remember why there won't be
any other passengers.

41:02.532 --> 41:06.036
You bought out the whole flight
so you can see D.C. from the air.

41:06.119 --> 41:07.454
All alone.

41:09.581 --> 41:10.790
Let's go.

41:16.630 --> 41:18.757
I told Val to take care
of the Prince lady...

41:18.840 --> 41:20.800
as soon as The Snake gets started
on his trip.

41:20.884 --> 41:23.887
- Is the chopper ready?
- Everything we need is waiting.

41:23.970 --> 41:25.555
Including this.

41:27.098 --> 41:30.226
- To the White House.
- To the White House.

41:39.194 --> 41:40.320
Hi.

42:01.758 --> 42:04.761
- They used sleeping gas on him.
- Diana's around here somewhere.

42:04.844 --> 42:08.389
She'll be all right.
This is the one we've got to worry about.

42:08.681 --> 42:10.350
He's the one they simulated.

42:10.433 --> 42:11.684
This guy? Why?

42:12.143 --> 42:14.479
That's what we have to find out.

42:19.358 --> 42:22.945
We've passed airport security,
why don't you take off that mask?

42:23.446 --> 42:24.697
Good idea.

42:37.376 --> 42:40.004
Thanks for letting me do the honors.

42:40.087 --> 42:44.759
You're the one that's hell-bent on teaching
the government a lesson. It's only fair.

42:46.218 --> 42:50.765
When my brother died during
one of their Doomsday experiments...

42:50.848 --> 42:52.349
no one listened.

42:53.059 --> 42:55.394
And recently five more men died.

42:56.020 --> 42:57.813
And still no one listened.

42:58.731 --> 43:01.692
Now, within the hour...

43:01.775 --> 43:04.445
tens of thousands will have perished.

43:06.405 --> 43:10.910
It will start at the White House,
descend Capitol Hill...

43:12.077 --> 43:15.456
wipe out all Federal agencies,
obliterate the Pentagon.

43:15.539 --> 43:20.002
And assure that research
into such Doomsday experiments...

43:20.461 --> 43:22.129
is abandoned forever.

43:23.005 --> 43:26.050
It's not very subtle,
but most definitely effective.

43:34.600 --> 43:38.353
All I know is
it was very important to simulate...

43:38.437 --> 43:40.647
that creepo helicopter pilot.

43:41.773 --> 43:43.066
Helicopter pilot?

43:43.150 --> 43:46.403
He takes tourists on aerial tours
of Washington.

43:47.112 --> 43:48.947
- Where?
- How should I know?

43:49.406 --> 43:51.617
- Here's the playback.
- National Gallery...

43:51.700 --> 43:54.953
Constitutional Hall, Library of Congress,
Capitol Hill.

43:55.120 --> 43:59.875
And then a run up Pennsylvania A venue
to the greatest thrill of them all:

43:59.958 --> 44:02.586
The White House!
I mean, you ha ven't lived...

44:02.669 --> 44:06.173
until you've looked into
the White House WindoWs at 300 feet.

44:06.506 --> 44:08.091
The White House, man.

44:08.425 --> 44:09.551
As a matter of fact...

44:09.634 --> 44:12.304
I'm one of the very few pilots
licensed to fly a chopper...

44:12.387 --> 44:15.807
over our nation's
most sacred monuments and buildings.

44:17.767 --> 44:20.187
Charlie? This is Steve Trevor.
Listen carefully.

44:20.270 --> 44:22.606
You've got a full-blown red alert
heading your way.

45:06.649 --> 45:08.276
Look at that big baby.

45:12.739 --> 45:14.741
Hang on, we're going in.

45:28.963 --> 45:30.715
Okay, toss it out.

45:35.261 --> 45:36.512
Oh, no.

45:38.306 --> 45:42.184
Throw it, Ward, make them learn!

46:12.339 --> 46:14.466
With Ward, Dede and Val in custody...

46:14.550 --> 46:16.885
the best place for that virus
is in a furnace.

46:16.969 --> 46:18.762
With the addition of the antidote.

46:18.846 --> 46:21.181
The virus is harmless.

46:21.265 --> 46:22.891
Yes, but what about next time...

46:22.975 --> 46:25.936
a deadly virus is accidentally discovered
in a laboratory?

46:26.020 --> 46:29.940
Well, I for one, plan to see
that there is no next time.

46:30.024 --> 46:33.527
I wish those two young people
had thought of another way...

46:33.610 --> 46:36.405
of making their feelings known.

46:36.488 --> 46:38.240
Which reminds me.

46:38.866 --> 46:42.661
There's still one thing that bothers me
about all this.

46:42.744 --> 46:44.955
- What's that?
- Mrs. Thrip...

46:45.747 --> 46:48.917
why did you go to that dating service?

46:50.377 --> 46:53.380
Well, I wanted to have a bit of fun.

46:54.172 --> 46:56.717
And I got tired of waiting for you.

47:00.470 --> 47:04.141
Dear girl, have I been so wrapped up
in my work...

47:04.599 --> 47:08.520
that I overlooked a gem like you?

47:08.729 --> 47:09.938
Yes!

47:13.734 --> 47:15.610
To rectify the oversight.

47:33.461 --> 47:35.380
Compu-Cupid strikes again.

48:11.499 --> 48:12.542
