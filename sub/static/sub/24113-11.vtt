15:28.500 --> 15:30.080
I can't right now, Madzie,

15:30.080 --> 15:32.670
but... I can leave
the light on if you want.

15:32.670 --> 15:34.210

Yeah. I suppose this...

15:59.830 --> 16:01.880
new, powerless reality

16:01.880 --> 16:03.420
is gonna take some time
to get used to.

16:03.420 --> 16:04.790
Hey...

16:04.790 --> 16:06.080
Of course it is.

16:07.420 --> 16:09.170

You know that, right?

16:11.380 --> 16:12.380
Mm!

16:12.380 --> 16:15.000
What?
She's right behind the door.

16:16.380 --> 16:17.620
So I can't kiss my boyfriend?

16:17.620 --> 16:19.250
Oh, you know how we get.

16:19.250 --> 16:21.210
How about we watch a movie?

16:21.210 --> 16:22.670
I've been meaning
to introduce you to the work

16:22.670 --> 16:24.080

16:25.460 --> 16:26.960

since she was a newborn.

17:55.210 --> 17:56.920
She's not going to stop
until she gets her back.

17:56.920 --> 17:59.250
How was she even able
to get past Magnus's wards?

18:01.170 --> 18:03.380
When Magnus lost his powers,
his wards did too.

18:05.250 --> 18:07.380
Madzie's back with Catarina.
She's portalling her

18:07.380 --> 18:10.420
to the High Warlock of Estonia's
castle outside of Koluvere.

18:12.040 --> 18:13.880
His wards should keep Iris out.

18:13.880 --> 18:15.670
Well, they can't stay
in Estonia forever.

18:15.670 --> 18:17.210
Which is why we need
to find Iris.

18:17.210 --> 18:19.830
Well, she's most likely still
in the city. We should act fast.

18:19.830 --> 18:21.170
Magnus, we have this covered.

18:21.170 --> 18:24.250
All right? Iris is
extremely dangerous.

18:24.250 --> 18:25.380
She's already escaped the Gard,

18:25.380 --> 18:27.210
and she's more than willing
to kill for Madzie.

18:27.210 --> 18:28.540

18:32.580 --> 18:34.250
I know how she thinks.

18:37.920 --> 18:39.500
(SIGHING) All right.

18:39.500 --> 18:42.120
OK. We can start with a sweep
around her brownstone.

18:42.120 --> 18:44.330
She's lived there
for over a century.

18:48.000 --> 18:49.120
Jace.

18:50.380 --> 18:51.460
We need to talk.
Whatever it is,

18:51.460 --> 18:53.330
I'm sure it can wait until
after we've found Iris Rouse.

18:53.330 --> 18:55.290
No, actually, it...

18:55.290 --> 18:56.290
it can't.

18:56.290 --> 18:58.330
The decision's been made.

18:58.330 --> 18:59.420
You need to take some time off

18:59.420 --> 19:00.620
to clear your head.

19:00.620 --> 19:02.120
Look, I don't know
what Isabelle told you--

19:02.120 --> 19:03.330
She told me enough!

19:03.330 --> 19:05.540
We both know
what you were thinking.

19:05.540 --> 19:07.040
Whatever.

19:07.040 --> 19:08.540
I've got prisoners to catch.

19:10.250 --> 19:12.460
You're gonna listen to me.
Clary is dead.

19:12.460 --> 19:15.420
Magnus gave up his power. Simon
and Luke risked their lives.

19:15.420 --> 19:16.880
And this is how you're
gonna repay them?

19:16.880 --> 19:19.250
With some kind of a death wish?
You should have killed me

19:19.250 --> 19:21.420
when you had the chance,
and Clary would still be here!

19:21.420 --> 19:22.750
Yeah, but she's not.

19:24.920 --> 19:26.290
And the way
that you're acting...

19:27.330 --> 19:29.290
...it's a disgrace
to her memory.

19:31.710 --> 19:33.170
If I lost you...

19:34.420 --> 19:36.000
...I'd be lost too.

19:40.380 --> 19:41.670
I'm so sorry.

19:44.580 --> 19:47.120
You're right. I didn't...
I didn't think of it like that.

19:50.290 --> 19:52.250
If you ever feel like this

19:52.250 --> 19:54.460
you have to come to me.

you were back in town.

20:14.460 --> 20:16.790
You must be like a kid
in a candy store in here.

20:17.790 --> 20:19.580
I guess you can say
this is my happy place.

20:21.420 --> 20:22.960
I need to talk to you
about Simon.

20:22.960 --> 20:24.420
Is he OK?

20:24.420 --> 20:26.420
Not exactly.

20:26.420 --> 20:29.500
After what happened
with Clary he's terrified

20:29.500 --> 20:32.000
about his mark, paralyzed by it.

20:32.000 --> 20:33.580
Poor Simon.

20:33.580 --> 20:35.380
And Clary and Simon have been

20:35.380 --> 20:37.290
best friends since
they were kids.

20:37.290 --> 20:38.330
It's not just Clary.

20:38.330 --> 20:40.080
That stalker vampire, Heidi,

20:40.080 --> 20:43.170
she made Simon feed on Becky
in front of their mom.

20:44.500 --> 20:46.460
Oh, my God.
Luckily Becky's OK,

20:46.460 --> 20:48.330
but his mom couldn't handle it.

20:49.710 --> 20:52.750
He had to encanto her
to make her believe he was dead.

20:54.040 --> 20:56.380
Simon had to say goodbye
to his mom forever.

20:57.380 --> 20:58.960
I had no idea.

20:59.920 --> 21:02.380
How could you? You weren't here.

21:03.960 --> 21:06.080
Me leaving had nothing
to do with Simon.

21:06.080 --> 21:07.500
I...

21:08.830 --> 21:11.290
I just needed to be alone.

21:13.290 --> 21:15.380
I mean, haven't you
ever felt like that?

21:15.380 --> 21:17.790
Like you just needed
to get away from it all?

21:17.790 --> 21:21.580
I have. I guess
when times get tough,

21:21.580 --> 21:24.170
some people need to be alone,

21:24.170 --> 21:26.670
and others need to be
around other people.

21:26.670 --> 21:28.750
I'm more like that.

21:28.750 --> 21:30.460
And I think Simon is too.

21:31.750 --> 21:34.580
Well, right now, Simon finds it
hard to be around anyone.

21:36.420 --> 21:38.960
I wanna find a way to help him
get rid of this mark.

21:40.580 --> 21:42.290
And if anyone could help...

21:43.380 --> 21:44.620

27:15.670 --> 27:16.750
What is this?

27:16.750 --> 27:18.750
All right. What if
Lilith's apartment

27:18.750 --> 27:22.830
never exploded but instead
was relocated just before

27:22.830 --> 27:24.290
with Clary alive inside of it?

27:24.290 --> 27:25.880
Relocated?

27:25.880 --> 27:28.380
Yes! When I was
a young Shadowhunter,

27:28.380 --> 27:31.250
I remember hearing about a rare
form of inter-dimensional travel

27:31.250 --> 27:32.830
that demons used.

27:34.120 --> 27:35.880
At 2:02AM three nights ago,

27:35.880 --> 27:37.620
at the exact moment
of the explosion,

27:37.620 --> 27:39.500
there was...

27:39.500 --> 27:42.040
there was a precipitous drop
in air pressure that occurred

27:42.040 --> 27:44.790
in just one square block...

27:44.790 --> 27:47.460
right at the building
where Clary was being held.

27:48.880 --> 27:50.080
Right. OK.

27:50.080 --> 27:53.080
So... I... I scanned
the rest of the data,

27:53.080 --> 27:54.620
and I...

27:56.210 --> 27:58.830
I scanned the rest of the data
and found one other time...

27:58.830 --> 27:59.880
when that happened.

27:59.880 --> 28:02.750
This is Harlem. This is
where Simon and Maia

28:02.750 --> 28:04.710
found the Church of Talto.
- Yes! Yes!

28:04.710 --> 28:05.710
I don't...

28:05.710 --> 28:06.710
The time?

28:06.710 --> 28:07.920
I see it. I see the time.

28:07.920 --> 28:09.960
I just, I don't understand--
It was right when Simon

28:09.960 --> 28:11.620
blew Lilith's disciples
into salt.

28:11.620 --> 28:13.000
It's not a coincidence!

Lilith probably sensed
that we were coming

28:14.120 --> 28:14.960
and got the hell out of Dodge!

28:21.580 --> 28:22.580

28:22.580 --> 28:24.750
I want her back

28:24.750 --> 28:26.120

28:26.120 --> 28:28.620
but this doesn't
necessarily mean anything.

28:30.540 --> 28:33.620

more detailed climate data

28:33.620 --> 28:34.920
than I do.

28:34.920 --> 28:35.830
Take it.

28:35.830 --> 28:38.380
All I'm asking is
that you look into it.

28:38.380 --> 28:40.540
I think you'll find that...

28:40.540 --> 28:42.080
there's something there.

without a shred of his powers.

29:03.580 --> 29:05.290

I think you do.

Stay out of my head!

29:13.670 --> 29:15.580

Her Nana is a violent criminal.

30:00.920 --> 30:03.000
Magnus isn't what
she's really after.

Madzie is. We can use
that to our advantage.

anywhere near her.

Madzie to Iris

isn't ripping you off?

a portal to Detroit

It's worth it. Izzy said if
there's someone that knows

30:28.330 --> 30:29.830
something that can
help you, it's him.

30:31.460 --> 30:33.040
There's a reason
she had him leave.

30:33.040 --> 30:35.120
He turned Heidi into a vampire.

30:36.960 --> 30:38.040

30:39.250 --> 30:41.080
I'm not excusing his behavior.

30:41.080 --> 30:42.920
But he knows more
about Daylighter lore

30:42.920 --> 30:44.920
than anyone else.
Isn't it at least

30:44.920 --> 30:46.670

a vampire who does.

Who?

32:12.000 --> 32:14.710
I was never able
to find him myself.

32:14.710 --> 32:16.380
But there's a legend...

32:16.380 --> 32:19.080
of a vampire who lives in hiding
in the sewers of New York.

in the city,

32:21.460 --> 32:23.830

No one I've met

32:23.830 --> 32:25.420
has even heard of his name,
