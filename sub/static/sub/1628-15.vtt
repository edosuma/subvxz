NARRATOR:
Previously on Once Upon A Time...

00:03.504 --> 00:04.664
Where has Rumplestiltskin gone?

00:04.755 --> 00:07.167
Do you really think you can just
stab him in the heart with your sword?

00:07.258 --> 00:09.419
Well, I prefer my hook,
but I can't find that now.

00:09.510 --> 00:12.422
With the Dark One gone,
we can search for his dagger.

00:12.513 --> 00:13.502
EMMA: Hereâ€™s your boy.

00:16.267 --> 00:18.098
-Nea|?
-Emma?

00:18.186 --> 00:19.175
Get out of my apartment!

00:19.270 --> 00:20.350
-Nea|...
-Emma, I got this.

00:20.438 --> 00:22.679
You two know each other! How?

00:22.773 --> 00:24.183
Mom? What's going on?

00:24.275 --> 00:25.264
Is this my son?

00:25.526 --> 00:27.517
A young boy will lead you to him.

00:27.612 --> 00:29.944
(ECHOING) The boy
will be your undoing.

00:30.031 --> 00:31.111
Then I'll just have to kill him.

00:35.870 --> 00:38.907
EVA: Let's be certain she's seated as
far away from the Duke as possible,

00:39.040 --> 00:40.530
for the Duchess's sake.

00:40.625 --> 00:41.614
Yes, ma'am.

00:44.212 --> 00:45.793
Do you like it?

00:45.880 --> 00:49.714
Oh, my dear Snow,
you are an absolute vision.

00:49.800 --> 00:51.540
You are gonna be the talk of the ball.

00:51.719 --> 00:54.051
And notjust because
it's for your birthday.

00:56.224 --> 00:57.259
(EVA SIGHS)

00:59.477 --> 01:03.390
Come. I can hardly believe
you're growing up so fast.

01:03.814 --> 01:04.803
(GASPS)

01:04.899 --> 01:06.230
Which reminds me.

01:06.317 --> 01:08.057
l have a gift for you.

01:08.152 --> 01:12.612
It was my mother's once,
and her mother's before that.

01:13.908 --> 01:15.944
And soon it will be yours.

01:27.755 --> 01:28.744
-EVA: Johanna?
-(GASPS) Oh!

01:28.839 --> 01:32.297
Oh, Your Majesty! Please forgive me.
| just wanted to see the...

01:32.385 --> 01:33.500
How dare you?

01:34.845 --> 01:36.221
That's mine!

01:36.305 --> 01:38.387
It's not for a servant.

01:38.474 --> 01:39.759
It was my mistake.

01:39.850 --> 01:41.306
-Servants don't wear crowns.
-Enough.

01:41.394 --> 01:45.103
-l'm sorry, Your Majesty...
-No. l was talking to Snow.

01:46.941 --> 01:47.930
Me?

01:48.067 --> 01:50.149
I thought I raised you
better than that, Snow.

01:50.236 --> 01:53.774
It doesn't matter
whether one is a servant or royalty.

01:53.948 --> 01:57.486
Everyone in the kingdom
deserves our love and respect.

01:57.576 --> 01:58.565
But she took my tiara...

01:58.661 --> 02:01.778
She apologized. And it isn't yours yet.

02:01.872 --> 02:02.998
Your Majesty, it's all right.

02:03.082 --> 02:06.495
You are kind, Johanna,
but Snow must learn.

02:06.585 --> 02:08.962
My dear, we are all the same.

02:09.797 --> 02:12.709
But I thought we were royals.

02:12.800 --> 02:16.588
We are. But that doesn't make us
better than anyone else.

02:16.721 --> 02:20.339
The upcoming ball, for instance.
Can you tell me what it's for?

02:20.433 --> 02:23.721
It's to honor me. On my birthday.

02:24.186 --> 02:27.428
No. It's for you to honor them.

02:27.523 --> 02:31.266
By showing them you will be a kind
and benevolent leader

02:31.360 --> 02:32.941
when that time comes.

02:33.029 --> 02:34.109
Please.

02:36.615 --> 02:39.857
When you're crowned with this
on your birthday,

02:39.952 --> 02:42.364
it will be a symbol
that you will always hold

02:42.455 --> 02:45.788
goodness in your heart and rule justly.

02:45.875 --> 02:47.786
Now do you understand?

02:49.337 --> 02:50.702
I do, Mother.

02:58.304 --> 02:59.589
It's beautiful.

02:59.680 --> 03:00.840
(BOTH CHUCKLE)

03:01.098 --> 03:04.340
And it's heavier than it looks.

03:04.435 --> 03:05.424
(ALL GASP)

03:05.519 --> 03:06.770
-Your Majesty?
-Mother!

03:06.854 --> 03:07.843
I'm fine.

03:07.938 --> 03:09.314
No, no, you're not.

03:09.398 --> 03:12.561
Come. There. I'm getting the doctor.

03:12.651 --> 03:13.640
Mother.

03:13.736 --> 03:15.476
I'm fine, dear.

03:27.958 --> 03:29.823
-What are you doing?
-Making breakfast.

03:29.919 --> 03:31.409
VVhy?

03:31.796 --> 03:32.785
I'm hungry.

03:32.880 --> 03:35.496
You think I don't know
what you're doing?

03:35.591 --> 03:37.331
We talked about this. We had a deal.

03:37.426 --> 03:38.757
I know, I know.

03:38.844 --> 03:42.507
But with the curse broken, I thought
maybe you would change your mind.

03:43.808 --> 03:45.639
Well, I didn't.

03:48.938 --> 03:50.303
What's this?

03:50.981 --> 03:52.562
-A birthday present.
-No, I told you.

03:52.650 --> 03:54.561
-|t's not from me.
-No one else knows.

03:54.652 --> 03:56.233
Apparently, someone does.

03:56.320 --> 03:58.436
And they also think
you should celebrate.

03:58.572 --> 04:01.109
It was left outside the door this morning.

04:09.166 --> 04:11.031
What is it?

04:21.429 --> 04:23.761
I thought that was lost
when the curse hit.

04:23.848 --> 04:25.179
(SNIFFLES)

04:25.391 --> 04:26.676
So did I.

04:35.526 --> 04:36.515
Johanna?

04:36.694 --> 04:39.276
I didn't know she was in Storybrooke.

04:41.240 --> 04:42.946
Neither did I.

04:45.536 --> 04:47.618
After the curse,
you were gone for a while.

04:47.705 --> 04:50.572
You know,
we're all still finding each other.

04:51.250 --> 04:52.740
It hasn't been easy.

04:53.961 --> 04:55.076
l have to go.

04:55.212 --> 04:56.247
Okay. Hey.

04:58.549 --> 04:59.538
Happy birthday.

05:01.260 --> 05:03.546
Thank you for understanding.

05:04.138 --> 05:06.880
You should go.

No. You will always be my dear Snow.

06:40.401 --> 06:41.891
-Ah!
-Oh! (CHUCKLES)

06:42.152 --> 06:44.359
I never thought I'd see you again.

06:46.782 --> 06:48.818
-Or this.
-Oh.

06:49.201 --> 06:54.070
I came across it in Mr. Gold's shop
and I knew how much it meant to you.

06:54.164 --> 06:56.200
I knew you had to have it.

06:56.792 --> 06:58.293
Thank you.

07:04.049 --> 07:07.291
I haven't seen those flowers
in a long time.

07:07.386 --> 07:09.593
They reminded me of you.

07:09.680 --> 07:12.387
Because they could survive
the harshest winter.

07:12.516 --> 07:15.849
And you were born
during the harshest one of all.

07:18.355 --> 07:20.516
That's why she named me Snow.

07:22.693 --> 07:26.311
I thought keeping this garden
would be a nice way to honor her.

07:31.035 --> 07:32.400
It is.

07:35.998 --> 07:38.239

Unless Hook lied to us.

lt'll just take a bit more time.

08:50.447 --> 08:53.154
And when we find it, I promise you,

08:53.283 --> 08:56.116
I'll use that dagger
to force the Dark One

09:16.640 --> 09:18.141
No, I'm fine.

09:18.267 --> 09:20.929
It's not me he wants, it's Gold.

09:21.061 --> 09:22.972
And his hook.

09:23.105 --> 09:25.812
Yeah, I'm gonna enjoy
throwing his ass in jail.

09:25.899 --> 09:27.230
Hook isn't the problem, David.

09:27.317 --> 09:29.273
-Tell that to my head.
-|t's Regina.

09:29.486 --> 09:31.647
She's been lying to us.

09:31.780 --> 09:33.987
She's working with Cora
to find Gold's dagger.

09:35.617 --> 09:37.482
The dagger controls him.

09:37.619 --> 09:41.737
If Cora gets it, she can force Gold
and all his power to do her bidding.

09:41.832 --> 09:44.915
Or become the Dark One herself.

09:45.002 --> 09:47.994
Neither one of
those options sounds good.

09:48.130 --> 09:50.997
Lucky for us, we can call
the man himself. He's with Emma.

09:51.091 --> 09:52.501
Tried it. I sent a message.

09:52.634 --> 09:54.010
Well, we can'tjust wait.

09:54.094 --> 09:55.800
No, we have to buy time
until they call us back or return.

09:55.888 --> 09:56.923
How?

09:59.349 --> 10:02.011
Regina. She doesn't trust her mother.
Never has.

10:02.144 --> 10:03.759
If we can put some doubt in her
about Cora's motives,

10:03.854 --> 10:04.843
it might slow them down.

10:04.938 --> 10:07.099
And you think she'll just trust you?

10:07.316 --> 10:11.025
Well, she doesn't need to trust me.
She just has to listen to me.

10:12.196 --> 10:14.278
And I know how to get her to do that.

10:18.535 --> 10:21.618
So, uh, you like pizza?

10:21.705 --> 10:23.787
Yeah. Let me guess,

10:23.874 --> 10:25.364
you're gonna tell me
the best pizza's in New York

10:25.501 --> 10:27.037
and I gotta try it, right?

10:27.127 --> 10:28.287

10:31.965 --> 10:35.048
Nah, it's in New York.
Here, let's get you a slice.

10:35.886 --> 10:37.547
So you're really from there?

10:37.721 --> 10:39.962
Yeah, I am.

an invitation would've been extended.

that the people closest to us

10:50.108 --> 10:52.235
are the ones capable of
causing us the most pain.

10:52.319 --> 10:55.186
That's our common ground, Miss Swan.

10:55.322 --> 10:58.530

just caught up with me.

10:58.617 --> 11:01.074
Give him time, he'll forgive you.

11:01.161 --> 11:02.776

11:06.458 --> 11:08.198
I can see that.

11:09.461 --> 11:10.792
I need you to speak to him.

11:11.922 --> 11:14.288
Try and convince him
to come back to Storybrooke with us.

11:14.383 --> 11:17.750
If I recall,
there was only one favor I owed you.

11:17.845 --> 11:19.005
And I think I'm paid up.

11:19.096 --> 11:21.337
This isn't about me anymore.
You'll do it for Henry.

11:21.431 --> 11:22.511
How do you figure that?

11:22.641 --> 11:24.427
Well, because if you don't,
you're gonna wake up one morning

11:24.518 --> 11:26.600
and discover he's hopped in a bus
back to New York.

11:26.687 --> 11:28.552
He ran away to Boston to be with you.

11:28.647 --> 11:30.478
He'll do the same thing for his father.

11:30.566 --> 11:32.898
Until Neal lets him down. Which he will.

11:33.026 --> 11:35.233
It'll be a hard lesson,
but then at least Henry will understand

11:35.320 --> 11:36.901
that I lied to protect him.

11:38.657 --> 11:40.363
Someone's beginning to sound
a lot like Regina.

11:42.744 --> 11:46.578
I think the real reason you lied
was to protect yourself.

11:46.665 --> 11:47.905
What's that supposed to mean?

11:48.000 --> 11:49.956
-From getting hurt again.
-That's not happening.

11:50.127 --> 11:51.663
Do you want a second a chance
with that man?

11:52.629 --> 11:54.210
What makes you think that?

You have no idea what...

What are we talking about?

12:04.516 --> 12:07.349
Emma, Neal wanted to
show me the museum.

12:07.436 --> 12:08.846
Do you think
we can go back to the apartment

12:08.937 --> 12:10.598
and get my camera?

12:10.689 --> 12:12.930
Yeah, well, I... Kids like culture, right?

12:13.817 --> 12:17.651
Sure. Yeah, that's fine.
You like the New York pizza?

12:17.738 --> 12:21.151
Yeah, it's delicious,
cheesy and doesn't lie.

12:23.076 --> 12:24.361
(DOOR BELLS JINGLE)

12:29.416 --> 12:30.781
So how is Henry? Is he okay?

12:30.876 --> 12:32.867
He's fine. Everything's fine.

12:32.961 --> 12:34.417
What did he say?

12:34.504 --> 12:36.415
I didn't actually talk to him.

12:40.761 --> 12:42.217
(SlGHS) Then why am I here?

12:42.304 --> 12:44.340
Because I know you've been lying.

And I thought
it was time we talk about it.

I don't know what you're talking about.

No, no, no. No more lying.

12:50.979 --> 12:56.064
I know you've been with your mother.
I know you're looking for the dagger.

12:59.154 --> 13:01.270
What I'm doing is my business.

13:01.365 --> 13:03.777
There's a war starting, Regina.

13:04.534 --> 13:05.910
That much is clear, yes.

13:05.994 --> 13:08.235
Lucky for you,

13:08.330 --> 13:12.949
you've earned enough goodwill with me
to give you one last chance.

13:13.043 --> 13:17.002
Just to choose the right side,
the side of good.

13:19.174 --> 13:21.881
Have you ever considered
that maybe, perhaps,

13:23.220 --> 13:24.756
I am good?

13:26.598 --> 13:28.134
l was always the Queen,

13:28.225 --> 13:30.136
it was you
who added "Evil" to my name.

13:30.227 --> 13:32.559
Good doesn't do what you do.

13:34.982 --> 13:37.598
Why? Regina, why go back
to being this way

13:37.693 --> 13:39.229
after how hard you tried?

13:39.361 --> 13:41.272
And what did it get me?

13:41.947 --> 13:44.859
Dinner with a bunch of hypocrites
who pretend they'll forgive me,

13:44.950 --> 13:47.157
when, in their hearts,

13:47.244 --> 13:50.907
they know they never will.

13:52.874 --> 13:54.660
You're giving me a chance?

13:54.751 --> 13:56.662
How about I give you one?

13:58.088 --> 14:00.044
Stay out of my way.

14:01.133 --> 14:03.545
Listening to your mother
is a mistake, Regina.

14:03.635 --> 14:06.468
Because listening to you
will work out so much better.

14:06.596 --> 14:10.384
She doesn't care about Henry.
All she wants is power.

14:12.019 --> 14:13.725
Power's how you get things.

14:14.938 --> 14:16.769
She doesn't care about you.

14:17.983 --> 14:19.348
Really?

14:22.154 --> 14:24.395
And what would you know
about mothers?

14:35.834 --> 14:37.074
Do you know what's wrong with her?

14:37.169 --> 14:38.955

14:40.922 --> 14:43.208
But I have hope
that we shall know soon.

14:43.300 --> 14:44.460
Then she'll be all right?

(WEAKLY) Snow.

14:46.636 --> 14:48.012

14:52.267 --> 14:53.768
(STUTTERS) What message
shall I give him?

14:53.852 --> 14:56.844
That whatever business
he's attending to can wait.

14:56.938 --> 14:59.065
He should be at his wife's side.

15:01.651 --> 15:03.858
We'll cancel the ball.

15:03.945 --> 15:06.072
And turn it into a celebration
once you're better.

15:06.156 --> 15:09.899
We can't cancel your birthday.
It will be fine.

15:10.911 --> 15:13.573
I will be well by then.

15:13.663 --> 15:16.826
I want to see you walking in,
in that tiara.

16:02.254 --> 16:04.119
We must hope the doctor will...

16:04.214 --> 16:07.047
He doesn't even know
what's wrong with her.

16:07.968 --> 16:10.050
How can we place hope in him?

16:11.179 --> 16:13.761
There has to be something
that can save her.

16:19.563 --> 16:21.428
Maybe there is.

16:23.650 --> 16:25.891
If medicine can't cure the Queen,

16:27.195 --> 16:28.856
(WHISPERS) perhaps magic can.

(WHISPERS) Magic?

16:33.285 --> 16:34.491
Yes.

16:36.496 --> 16:40.739

someone few know about.

Someone schooled with
the most powerful of magic.

16:44.546 --> 16:47.834
I'm not really supposed
to even know of this.

16:47.924 --> 16:49.209
Please, Johanna.

16:51.178 --> 16:55.091
There is a benevolent fairy
who can grant a person's wish,

16:55.182 --> 16:56.763
if their heart is true.

16:56.850 --> 16:59.887
Mine is. I swear.

It looks like he sailed his ship here.

another must die.

To salvage a life beyond hope
means breaking the laws of nature.

then you must lose one in return.

over the heart of your sacrifice

and whisper their name.

23:19.649 --> 23:22.015

that person's life
will be traded for your mother's.

40:48.113 --> 40:49.774
Hold on to goodness.

40:50.866 --> 40:53.107
It's what my mother taught me.

40:53.243 --> 40:55.529
How many more lives
is following that lesson

40:55.621 --> 40:56.986
going to take away from me?

40:57.080 --> 41:01.073
You can't let Cora
make you lose faith in who you are.

41:01.168 --> 41:03.329
Someone who does the right thing.

41:04.254 --> 41:05.994
You know,
that's exactly what she wants.

41:06.089 --> 41:07.704
I made the "right" decision

41:07.799 --> 41:11.758
when I stopped Regina's execution
all those years ago,

41:13.096 --> 41:16.384
when it could have saved us
all of this heartache.

41:16.475 --> 41:19.308
I made the "right" decision

41:19.394 --> 41:22.511
when I sent Emma
through the wardrobe alone,

41:22.606 --> 41:24.892
and we didn't see her first steps.

41:26.985 --> 41:29.476
I made the "right" decision

41:29.571 --> 41:32.734
when I let my own mother die
from Cora's poison.

41:34.242 --> 41:35.573
And we keep beating them.

41:35.661 --> 41:37.367
At what cost?

41:39.331 --> 41:43.791
All I want is our happy ending. It's time.

41:44.461 --> 41:46.122
We've earned it.

41:46.505 --> 41:50.373
No more lives lost,
no more hearts broken.

41:51.134 --> 41:55.127
The dagger, it's useless
until Gold returns to Storybrooke.

41:55.222 --> 41:57.338
We have time. We'll get it back.

41:57.432 --> 41:59.889
And when we do, we can bring
Cora and Regina to justice.

42:00.018 --> 42:02.634
I don't care aboutjustice anymore.

42:05.190 --> 42:07.681
We keep thinking
that people will change.

42:09.653 --> 42:11.484
What if that's wrong?

42:14.241 --> 42:17.199
What if I'm the one who has to change?

42:19.079 --> 42:20.489
Change how?

42:22.666 --> 42:25.203
I'm going to kill Cora.
