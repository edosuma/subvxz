"Cops" is filmed on location

00:34.517 --> 00:36.586
with the men and women
of law enforcement.

00:36.620 --> 00:39.137
All suspects are innocent
until proven guilty

00:39.172 --> 00:40.965
in a court of law.

00:42.758 --> 00:45.517
-I'’ve been with the Spokane
County Sheriff'’s Office
for three years.

00:45.551 --> 00:49.758
I was a volunteer firefighter
for about eight years,
and I really liked it.

00:49.793 --> 00:52.655
I got to drive the fire trucks
around, and, you know,

00:52.689 --> 00:54.448
got to go to emergencies
and stuff like that,

00:54.482 --> 00:57.586
and it was a really cool way
for me to get my foot
in the door as a public servant.

00:57.620 --> 01:00.482
But I knew throughout
my entire time there,

01:00.517 --> 01:04.275
um, that law enforcement
was where my-- my heart landed.

01:04.310 --> 01:06.586
-[car screeching]

01:06.620 --> 01:09.275
-We'’re behind Arby's,
Division and Francis.

01:09.310 --> 01:11.103
Oh, he'’s gonna go for it.

01:13.448 --> 01:15.655
13, he'’s failed to yield.

01:15.689 --> 01:19.344
We'’re goin' through the back
of the Jack in the Box.

01:26.965 --> 01:30.000
-[siren continuing]

01:32.793 --> 01:35.965
-It'’s a possible DUI,
he was all over the road
before we started.

01:36.000 --> 01:39.413
-[car screeching]
-And we'’re gonna go southbound

01:39.448 --> 01:42.275
on whatever street
borders the Lowe'’s here.

01:42.310 --> 01:43.655
Goin'’ up to Lidgerwood.

-[siren blaring]
-No speed, traffic, 40.

01:47.551 --> 01:50.275
Blowin'’ the stop sign
at Lidgerwood.

01:50.310 --> 01:52.517
Now we'’re at Lyons, southbound.

01:54.689 --> 01:58.517
-So we had a driver
that failed to signal

01:58.551 --> 02:04.379
and then tried to turn in
to a parkin'’ lot.

02:04.413 --> 02:07.655
13, we'’re goin'
northbound, Addison.

02:07.689 --> 02:10.655
Pullin'’ into
Lyons Crest Apartments.

02:20.586 --> 02:22.758

02:22.793 --> 02:24.413

-[siren blaring]

02:27.620 --> 02:29.793
-Stop!

02:31.689 --> 02:33.137
13, I got one
not obeyin'’ commands,

02:33.172 --> 02:35.931
he'’s yankin' his hands
away from me.

02:35.965 --> 02:38.965
Give me your hands now.
You got it?

02:41.241 --> 02:43.034
Stop moving!
Got it?

02:46.034 --> 02:48.689
All right, brother.
Roll to your side.

02:48.724 --> 02:50.793
Roll to your side.
Here you go.

02:50.827 --> 02:52.482
Bend in like you'’re
gonna sit up.

02:54.172 --> 02:56.655
Keep goin'’, you got it.
Now roll onto that knee,

02:56.689 --> 02:58.965
and come straight up for me.

02:59.000 --> 03:01.517
-You got my keys?
-Up, up. We'’ll get there
in a second.

03:01.551 --> 03:03.896
-Turn and face the car.
-Hey, could you pull my car in?

03:03.931 --> 03:05.482
-Relax, come on back here.

03:05.517 --> 03:08.758
-What, man?
-Turn and face the car for me?

03:08.793 --> 03:11.241
-Just wanna go home.
-Spread your feet apart.
[chuckling] Yeah.

03:11.275 --> 03:13.034
You ain'’t gonna make it.
Back up.

03:13.068 --> 03:14.551
-All right.
-Back up.

03:14.586 --> 03:16.206
One step.
There you go.

03:16.241 --> 03:18.448
You got anything in your pockets
that'’s gonna stick me,
poke me, prod me?

03:18.482 --> 03:20.620
-No.
-No? Okay.

03:22.310 --> 03:24.448
So as of this moment,
you'’re under arrest
for eluding.

03:29.620 --> 03:31.517
-Bottle in the seat.
-What'’s that?

03:31.551 --> 03:33.379
-Bottle in the seat.

03:33.413 --> 03:35.827
-I can'’t understand
what you'’re-- Oh,
"Bottle in the seat," got it.

03:35.862 --> 03:37.000
-The seat.
-All right.

03:37.034 --> 03:39.689
So there'’s an open Black Velvet
whiskey bottle

03:39.724 --> 03:42.862
with, oh, about a third
of whiskey left in it.

03:42.896 --> 03:44.827
Must'’ve had one
for the road.

03:51.206 --> 03:53.448
Hey, partner.
-Yeah.

03:55.517 --> 03:57.655
Have you been read
your rights yet?

03:57.689 --> 03:59.482
You'’re not-- You're not
under arrest for anything.

03:59.517 --> 04:01.620
You'’re just bein' detained
until we figure
this whole deal out.

04:01.655 --> 04:03.482
-Oh. Yeah.
-Does that make sense?

04:03.517 --> 04:05.137
-So what'’s the deal, man?
Why'’d he run?

04:05.172 --> 04:08.827
-He just ran from the police,
I don'’t know.

04:08.862 --> 04:12.931
Honestly, me and mine...
we'’re traveling back on my own.

04:12.965 --> 04:16.551
-Who'’s the dude drivin'?
-That'’s-- That's my brother--

04:16.586 --> 04:18.827
That'’s my cousin.
-Your cousin or your brother?

04:18.862 --> 04:22.241
-My cousin brother,
like, whatever it is...
-Cousin like a brother?

04:22.275 --> 04:25.000
-Yeah.
-Okay. How long have you guys
been drinkin'’ together tonight?

04:25.034 --> 04:27.241
-That'’s it, like a year.

04:27.275 --> 04:31.000
-No, no, no. You guys
were drinking, tonight.
-That'’s a year.

04:31.034 --> 04:32.344
-Uh, tonight, though.
How long--

04:32.379 --> 04:34.275
-That'’s what I'm sayin'’,
like a year.

04:34.310 --> 04:35.862
-A year.
That doesn'’t make any sense.

04:35.896 --> 04:39.206
-Like, they was over there
tonight, like, tonight.

04:39.241 --> 04:42.379
-Okay, where were you guys
drinking tonight?

04:42.413 --> 04:44.344
-From there.
That'’s all I know.

04:44.379 --> 04:45.758
-Okay, hang tight, bud.

04:45.793 --> 04:48.206
Is the other dude
saying anything?

04:48.241 --> 04:50.862
Where-- Which car is he in?

04:50.896 --> 04:51.931
-I don'’t know
which car he'’s in.

04:51.965 --> 04:53.000
-I wanna say that last one.

04:53.034 --> 04:54.517
-Okay.
-SUV over there.

04:54.551 --> 04:56.379
-All right.

04:56.413 --> 04:58.655
What'’s up, man?

04:58.689 --> 05:00.551
So, what were you guys
doin'’ tonight?

05:00.586 --> 05:02.586
I was goin'’ to get some food
and come home.

05:02.620 --> 05:04.137
-You were goin'’ to get some food
and come home?

05:04.172 --> 05:06.000
Were you guys out drinkin'’
before you started drivin'’?

05:06.034 --> 05:07.862
-No.
-You'’re not drunk at all?

05:07.896 --> 05:12.206
You haven'’t had one drink.
Why are you slurrin'’ your words
and reek of alcohol, then?

05:12.241 --> 05:14.827
-I'’m not slurrin' my words, bro.
I got [bleep] knocked over

05:14.862 --> 05:16.896
and you guys threw me
on the curb.

05:16.931 --> 05:20.137
-So what was with the thing
of whiskey in the driver'’s seat?

05:20.172 --> 05:21.931
-What'’s that?
-Huh?

05:21.965 --> 05:24.344
-What?
-That'’s, uh-- That's--

05:24.379 --> 05:26.241
You'’ve understood me
up until this point.

05:26.275 --> 05:28.586
There'’s a big old thing
of whiskey in the driver'’s seat.

05:28.620 --> 05:31.000
-Really?
-What-- Yeah!
Are you surprised?

05:31.034 --> 05:32.517
-Where'’s Georgia?
Where'’s Georgia?

05:32.551 --> 05:34.655
-Where'’s Georgia?
-Yeah.

05:34.689 --> 05:36.655
-Do you mean to say
"Where'’s George at?"

05:36.689 --> 05:40.000
-My friend.
-Yeah. He'’s over there.
He'’s talkin' to us.

05:40.034 --> 05:42.586
So you decided to run
from me, why, then?

05:42.620 --> 05:45.068
-No.
I didn'’t decide to run.
I pulled up by my place.

05:45.103 --> 05:47.241
So I could make sure
my car is good.

05:47.275 --> 05:49.655
-No.
-Yeah, I promise you,
that'’s what I wanted to do.

05:49.689 --> 05:51.620
-So you didn'’t try
and run at all?
-No.

05:51.655 --> 05:54.482
-So what were you thinkin'’
when you saw the red and blue
lights in your rearview, then?

05:54.517 --> 05:55.793
-You turned around
and looked at me.

05:55.827 --> 05:58.724
-No...
-You pulled into the parkin'’ lot
behind Petco.

05:58.758 --> 06:01.000
I saw you turn around--
as soon as I hit the lights,

06:01.034 --> 06:03.413
you turned,
and your eyes locked
directly onto my car.

06:03.448 --> 06:05.137
-Listen, I just wanted
to make sure my car is good.

06:05.172 --> 06:08.206
-Hm. Okay.
So you'’re under arrest
for eluding a police vehicle...

06:08.241 --> 06:10.655
-Okay.
If that'’s what you wanna say.

06:10.689 --> 06:13.413
-...as well as DUI.
-What?

06:13.448 --> 06:15.137
-Yeah, you'’re drunk
as a skunk, dude.
-I'’m not drunk.

06:15.172 --> 06:17.793
-Yeah, you are.
Okay? So, you'’re gonna be

06:17.827 --> 06:18.965
booked into jail
on those charges.

06:19.000 --> 06:20.931
Do you have any questions
for me?

06:20.965 --> 06:23.344
There may be more charges
pending, I haven'’t looked
at your driver status

06:23.379 --> 06:25.655
or any of that stuff.
I don'’t know if you're
suspended or what?

06:25.689 --> 06:28.379
But those are the two charges
right at the moment

06:28.413 --> 06:31.206
that you'’re under arrest for.
-Really?

06:31.241 --> 06:32.827
-Really, really.

06:32.862 --> 06:34.862
Okay? All right.

06:36.551 --> 06:38.758
All right, man,
so here'’s the deal.
We'’re gonna cut you loose, okay?

06:38.793 --> 06:40.241
You'’re not under arrest
for anything tonight.

06:40.275 --> 06:43.862
-Yeah.
-On top of your head, please?
Thank you. Perfect.

06:43.896 --> 06:45.862
But you need to make
better decisions, all right?

06:45.896 --> 06:48.206
Probably don'’t hang out
with people who are gonna
run from the police.

06:48.241 --> 06:51.344
-Yeah.
-You'’re free to go or go up
to that apartment. All right?

06:51.379 --> 06:53.931
Steer clear of the car, please.

06:53.965 --> 06:56.862
Eluding, DUI, resisting...

06:56.896 --> 06:58.965
I think that'’ll do it.
-Okay.

06:59.000 --> 07:00.551
-Medical, right?
-Medics are gonna
check him out,

07:00.586 --> 07:02.448
'’cause he's got
a nice raspberry on his face

07:02.482 --> 07:04.689
from where it connected
with the pavement.

07:04.724 --> 07:07.068
I'’m good, yeah,
just a little scratch.

07:07.103 --> 07:10.379
Road rash.
That'’s what wearin'
short sleeves will get you.

07:12.758 --> 07:15.862
-Wichita is on the cusp
of becomin'’ a big city.

07:15.896 --> 07:21.379
We'’re still small enough
that you can be familiar
with the entire town,

07:21.413 --> 07:25.275
but we'’re big enough
that there'’s people
that you still don'’t know.

07:25.310 --> 07:28.586
Uh, the weather here
is-- is pretty much
in the middle.

07:28.620 --> 07:32.862
We'’ve got hot summers
and cold winters,
no real extremes.

07:32.896 --> 07:36.862
We'’re gonna check out this car
that looks like it'’s trying
to take off on us down there

07:36.896 --> 07:39.310
through Dillons'’ parking lot.

07:39.344 --> 07:45.586
And it looks like it'’s
headin'’ back to the...
the Value Place hotel back here.

07:47.931 --> 07:49.206
Is that it?

07:54.862 --> 07:56.758
642, I got one runnin'’.

07:56.793 --> 07:58.896
Westbound from 47th
and Broadway.

07:58.931 --> 08:00.241
Put your hands
on the front of that car.

08:00.275 --> 08:01.620
-I will.
-Don'’t move.

08:01.655 --> 08:03.620
-Man [over radio]: Sorry.
Say what? The auto parts store?

08:03.655 --> 08:05.137
-Woman [over radio]:
West of Value Place.

08:05.172 --> 08:07.379
-Hey, who was in this car?

08:07.413 --> 08:09.758
-My, uh, that would be
my children'’s father.

08:09.793 --> 08:11.344
-Your children'’s father?
What'’s his name?

08:11.379 --> 08:15.517
-Um... his name'’s Tyler.
-Tyler? Is he white or black?

08:15.551 --> 08:18.034
-He'’s white.
-Okay.

08:18.068 --> 08:20.758
White male, maybe five-ten.
There'’s two fences here.

08:20.793 --> 08:22.758
I don'’t know if he went
straight west or went north
or south

08:22.793 --> 08:25.413
or if he'’s just on the other
side of this wall
and I just can'’t get to him.

08:25.448 --> 08:27.620
-Am I really in trouble?
-No.

08:27.655 --> 08:29.655
I'’m doin' this to keep you
from goin'’ anywhere.

08:29.689 --> 08:32.000
-Okay...
-Where were you
comin'’ from over there?

08:32.034 --> 08:34.344
-We were just riding around.
Because he'’s always in trouble.

08:34.379 --> 08:35.689
And he'’s getting-- he's--
he'’s absconded.

08:35.724 --> 08:36.965
He'’s a parole.
-Okay.

08:37.000 --> 08:38.413
And he knows
it'’s gonna go bad.

08:38.448 --> 08:40.379
And so he wanted just--
you know...

08:40.413 --> 08:41.827
-Come over, just
have a seat in my car

08:41.862 --> 08:43.448
while I get this figured out,
all right?

08:43.482 --> 08:46.931
-He'’s a parole absconder.
They let him out and he didn'’t
come back.

08:48.206 --> 08:50.034
But you heard him
come over here and crack?

08:50.068 --> 08:52.275
You didn'’t hear nothin'
that way but straight out
that way?

08:52.310 --> 08:54.620
-I heard branches
and then nothin'’.

08:54.655 --> 08:57.034
-Police!
[indistinct] dog or get bit!

08:57.068 --> 08:58.344
-[dog whines]

09:00.137 --> 09:03.965
-[indistinct shouting]

09:04.000 --> 09:05.517
-Comin'’ up, [indistinct]
comin'’ up.

09:05.551 --> 09:06.655
-Hey, there, drop,
do not move,

09:06.689 --> 09:08.724
or I'’ll send my dog over,
you will get bit.

09:08.758 --> 09:10.931
-Do not move!

09:10.965 --> 09:13.379
-Do not move!
-No, sir, I will not move.

09:13.413 --> 09:15.275
Please, sir--

09:15.310 --> 09:18.482
-Back up!
Back up to the sound
of my voice.

09:18.517 --> 09:20.275
-I'’m doin' it.
My legs are numb, sir.

09:20.310 --> 09:23.172
-You'’re gonna get
your ass eaten by a dog
if you do anything stupid.

09:23.206 --> 09:25.827
-Please don'’t, I won't.
-Put your hands
behind your back.

09:25.862 --> 09:27.413
Put your hands right
back here behind your back.

09:27.448 --> 09:29.827
-Yes, sir. What'’d I do?
-Good job, buddy.

09:29.862 --> 09:31.862
-What are you doin'’
in this guy'’s backyard?

09:31.896 --> 09:34.862
-Sleepin'’.
-Let'’s go this way.
You were sleepin'’ back here?

09:34.896 --> 09:37.275
-I was sleepin'’, yeah.
What'’s goin' on?

09:37.310 --> 09:38.448
-You don'’t know, huh?
-No.

09:38.482 --> 09:40.103
-Tired, dude.
Tired of walkin'’.

09:40.137 --> 09:41.827
-Yeah?
Where were you walkin'’ from?

09:41.862 --> 09:44.068
-My house.
-Where'’s your house?

09:44.103 --> 09:47.689
-In Wichita, dude.
-In Wichita?
It'’s a big place.

09:53.310 --> 09:55.827
-Good job... [indistinct]

09:55.862 --> 09:57.034
-Christina?
-Yeah?

09:57.068 --> 09:59.586
-Hi.
What is goin'’ on?

09:59.620 --> 10:02.068
-I don'’t know.
He gets on my nerves.

10:02.103 --> 10:05.655
-He gets on your nerves?
-He always does
this stupid [bleep].

10:05.689 --> 10:07.206
I was with him for 10 years,
you know.

10:07.241 --> 10:09.931
-Were you guys in town
just to run around
or hang out or what?

10:09.965 --> 10:12.827
-I was in town
just to visit him to try
to talk some [bleep] sense

10:12.862 --> 10:17.862
into him before he got shot.
Or-- Or he got mangled by a dog.

10:17.896 --> 10:19.379
-And that evidently
didn'’t work out.

10:19.413 --> 10:21.310
Sounds like you gotta
stay away from him.

10:21.344 --> 10:24.620
-Psycho.
-Hey, when we turned around
on him, over here on Broadway,

10:24.655 --> 10:27.206
did he say anything, or did
he just start drivin'’ crazy?

10:27.241 --> 10:28.862
-Started drivin'’ crazy.
He'’s been drivin' crazy.

10:28.896 --> 10:30.241
-Did you-- Did you
say anything to him,

10:30.275 --> 10:32.034
like, what'’s goin' on,
why are you doin'’ this?

10:32.068 --> 10:35.482
-I already knew,
and he'’s sayin' "I'’m sorry,
baby, I'’m sorry. Sorry."

10:35.517 --> 10:38.000
-So do you have
any property that'’s
left in the car

10:38.034 --> 10:40.241
that we need to get for you
before I give the car back

10:40.275 --> 10:41.965
to the guy
that it was stolen from?

10:42.000 --> 10:45.862
-All I had was a cell phone
and a-- a cream wallet.

10:45.896 --> 10:47.793
-So the purse that'’s
in the car, that'’s
not your purse?

10:47.827 --> 10:49.724
-No. Who knows
whose purse it is.

10:49.758 --> 10:52.793
But that'’s probably the little
tricks he was messin'’ with
before I came back here.

10:52.827 --> 10:56.206
-All right.
Well, sit tight for me
a minute, okay?

10:56.241 --> 10:58.965
-This was...
-It was in the passenger seat
of the car.

10:59.000 --> 11:01.310
Looks like it could be meth.
-I'’ll have to test it
and find out.

11:01.344 --> 11:03.206
-They either--
They burnt it or somethin'’.

11:03.241 --> 11:06.620
-Huh. Imagine that.
I got her ID card,

11:06.655 --> 11:09.000
with her dope in her purse.

11:12.034 --> 11:13.724
-There it is.
-Oh, it'’s meth.

11:13.758 --> 11:16.000
This has tested positive
for methamphetamine.

11:16.034 --> 11:18.758
-This thing'’s just full
of paraphernalia.

11:18.793 --> 11:23.586
-He'’s got a Kansas Department
of Corrections warrant
for auto theft.

11:23.620 --> 11:25.862
-Hey, buddy.
You all right?

11:25.896 --> 11:29.758
You, uh-- We found you
sleepin'’ over here
in somebody'’s garden?

11:29.793 --> 11:33.586
What are you doin'’ over there?
-Nothin'’, just walkin',
I don'’t know.

11:33.620 --> 11:35.689
-Just walkin'’?
-Got tired, bro.

11:35.724 --> 11:36.931
-Got tired?

11:36.965 --> 11:39.931
Okay.
-I had no idea
where I was at.

11:39.965 --> 11:41.275
-You didn'’t know
where you were at?

11:41.310 --> 11:43.793
-No.
Why do they have me
in handcuffs?

11:45.068 --> 11:47.517
-You don'’t know
why you'’re in handcuffs?
-No.

11:47.551 --> 11:49.655
-Well, you'’re in handcuffs
'’cause you jumped out
of a stolen car,

11:49.689 --> 11:52.206
jumped over a wall,
and ran over and hid
in somebody'’s garden.

11:52.241 --> 11:53.724
-I never did no [bleep]
like that, dude.

11:53.758 --> 11:56.206
I wasn'’t driving anything.
-Okay.

11:56.241 --> 11:58.862
-I ain'’t got a vehicle.
-You'’re also a parole absconder,

11:58.896 --> 12:02.275
so you'’re in custody
for-- for a warrant.
-Okay.

12:02.310 --> 12:06.482
-What were you in prison for?
-Uh... I don'’t know, man.

12:06.517 --> 12:09.655
It'’s been a long time.
-You don'’t remember
why you went to prison?

12:09.689 --> 12:11.620
It wasn'’t memorable enough
to stick out in your mind

12:11.655 --> 12:13.896
as bein'’ somethin' to...
-Long time ago...

12:13.931 --> 12:16.517
-Long time ago?
How about auto theft?

12:16.551 --> 12:19.517
-What about it?
-That'’s what you
were in prison for.

12:19.551 --> 12:21.724
-Okay.

12:21.758 --> 12:23.862
What'’s that got to do
with me bein'’ in this cop car?

12:23.896 --> 12:26.620
-Well, you got a warrant,
so that'’s why you're
in the cop car.

12:26.655 --> 12:29.310
-Don'’t make no sense.
You guys, like, rushed up
on me and [bleep]

12:29.344 --> 12:32.275
when I was asleep,
and you grabbed me up.

12:32.310 --> 12:35.344
I don'’t even know
where the [bleep] I'’m at,
or what'’s goin' on.

12:35.379 --> 12:38.689
I got warrants, you said?
When did they post this out?

12:38.724 --> 12:40.034
-I don'’t know, partner.

12:40.068 --> 12:41.206
For right now,
you'’re under arrest

12:41.241 --> 12:42.344
for possession
of stolen property,

12:42.379 --> 12:44.758
and I don'’t know
if you'’re valid or not,

12:44.793 --> 12:46.379
but probably
some traffic stuff.

12:46.413 --> 12:48.827
-I don'’t drive.
-Driving while suspended,
or somethin'’ like that.

12:48.862 --> 12:51.275
-I was never driving
anything, bro,
I don'’t drive.

12:54.724 --> 12:59.172
-Okay, so, Christina?
Um, with your ID
and all that stuff

12:59.206 --> 13:01.068
and where I found it
in the purse?

13:01.103 --> 13:04.413
Okay, I also found
some methamphetamine,
a lot of paraphernalia,

13:04.448 --> 13:07.827
like a lot of paraphernalia.
-In the purse?

13:07.862 --> 13:09.586
-In the purse.
-Uh-huh.

13:09.620 --> 13:13.551
-Um... so, you'’re--
-They'’re gonna charge me
with all that [bleep].

13:13.586 --> 13:14.827
-Well, whether
you get charged or not,

13:14.862 --> 13:16.206
it'’s up to
the district attorney'’s office,

13:16.241 --> 13:18.000
but tonight you'’re gonna
go to jail, you'’re in custody

13:18.034 --> 13:19.827
for... uh...
-I'’m gonna kill him.

13:19.862 --> 13:21.379
-...possession
of methamphetamine
and possession

13:21.413 --> 13:23.655
of drug paraphernalia.

13:23.689 --> 13:26.275
All right?
-For being at home, wow.

13:26.310 --> 13:28.344
-Gotta leave that guy alone.
-Yeah.

13:30.689 --> 13:32.034
-So one good thing
about law enforcement

13:32.068 --> 13:35.068
is you can kind of find an area
that you'’re either good at

13:35.103 --> 13:36.586
or you like working.

13:36.620 --> 13:38.172
I enjoy working narcotics

13:38.206 --> 13:40.793
and trying to get
illegal weapons off the street.

13:40.827 --> 13:43.586
I feel that, by doin'’ this,
it kind of helps curb violence

13:43.620 --> 13:48.206
and also helps keep
the community safer.

13:48.241 --> 13:50.068
Hey, Masterson,
we'’re gonna stop it here

13:50.103 --> 13:53.931
at... Lincoln and just east
of the I.

13:55.344 --> 13:57.586
All right, now I'’m behind
a stolen moped

13:57.620 --> 13:58.724
that'’s rollin' down the street,

13:58.758 --> 14:00.793
so we'’re gonna see
if they'’ll stop for us.

14:00.827 --> 14:04.103
-[siren blaring]
-[radio chatter]

14:04.137 --> 14:05.758
-Somethin'’--
they just dropped it.

14:07.034 --> 14:08.103
He'’s stopping.

14:08.137 --> 14:10.793
-[siren blaring]

14:14.586 --> 14:15.724
-Hey, Cory,
they dropped somethin'’.

14:15.758 --> 14:17.862
Hey, get off.
Shut off your bike.

14:20.344 --> 14:23.379
-Why?
-Shut off your bike.
'’Cause I said so.

14:23.413 --> 14:24.413
-Okay.

14:26.310 --> 14:28.689
-Put '’em in cuffs.
-What for?

14:28.724 --> 14:32.275
-We'’ll talk to you.
-Jesus.

14:32.310 --> 14:34.137
-For what?
-We'’ll talk about it
in a second.

14:34.172 --> 14:35.379
He dropped a bag.

14:35.413 --> 14:37.379
Put your-- Get your hands
out of your pocket.

14:38.793 --> 14:40.896
-Man [on radio]:
1-23, check-in.

14:40.931 --> 14:42.724
-We'’re fine.
We'’re stopped.

14:42.758 --> 14:44.000
Two in custody.

14:45.310 --> 14:47.448
-Man [over radio]: 10-4.
One in custody and one 30.

14:47.482 --> 14:48.896
-We'’ll tell you
in just a second.

14:48.931 --> 14:51.068
-[radio chatter]

14:52.689 --> 14:55.344
-Come over here.
-I'’ll tell you
in just one second.

14:59.172 --> 15:00.551
-What'’s-- What's
in that bag?

15:00.586 --> 15:02.137
-I didn'’t even know
it was in my pocket.

15:02.172 --> 15:04.482
-What is it?
What'’s that in the bag?

15:04.517 --> 15:07.275
-No idea.
-You don'’t know
what it is at all?

15:07.310 --> 15:10.103
-Uh-uh.
-Let'’s come back here to my car
just for a second, okay?

15:10.137 --> 15:11.310
-Okay.

15:11.344 --> 15:14.482
-They tossed a baggie out.
Right there.

15:18.551 --> 15:21.896
-I'’m gonna have you
have a seat in my car,
just for a minute.

15:21.931 --> 15:25.379
-[radio chatter]

15:25.413 --> 15:28.862
-I'’ll be right back
with you, okay?

15:28.896 --> 15:33.137
After we took him
into custody, this was located
in his front, left pocket.

15:33.172 --> 15:35.862
-She has paraphernalia.
We'’ll wait for a female
to search her and see

15:35.896 --> 15:40.241
if she has any other
stuff in her pockets
or anything like that, so...

15:40.275 --> 15:42.793
-Sounds good.
-All right.

15:42.827 --> 15:44.137
-Hey, Frances?
-Mm-hm?

15:44.172 --> 15:46.172
-How do you know that guy?

15:46.206 --> 15:48.517
-He'’s been a friend
of my sister'’s for a long time.
-Okay.

15:48.551 --> 15:50.689
He'’s your-- friend
of your sister'’s?
-Mm-hm.

15:50.724 --> 15:55.206
-Okay.
-Yeah, I met him...
about five years ago. Why?

15:55.241 --> 15:57.724
-Just curious.
You know whose bike that is?

15:57.758 --> 15:59.137
-Uh-uh.
-You don'’t?

15:59.172 --> 16:00.551
-No.
-Okay.

16:00.586 --> 16:02.931
Did he come pick you up
at your house or what'’s
the deal?

16:02.965 --> 16:04.655
-Yeah, he came by there.
-What did he pick you up in?

16:04.689 --> 16:06.827
-That.
-The bike? Okay.

16:08.448 --> 16:10.379
So right now, I'’m gonna
test the crystal substance

16:10.413 --> 16:12.758
that was found
in the male'’s pocket.

16:12.793 --> 16:15.827
Uh, if we have a test...
if we have a positive test,

16:15.862 --> 16:17.689
it'’s gonna turn purple.

16:21.931 --> 16:25.103
And like that...
got a positive test.

16:26.413 --> 16:28.965
-Hey, Stevie. So the reason
that we stopped you

16:29.000 --> 16:32.103
is because, ran your plate
and it came back stolen.

16:32.137 --> 16:34.724
-I can'’t believe that, that's--
-I keep hearin'’ it, partner.

16:34.758 --> 16:40.965
-Yeah, I can'’t believe that.
'’Cause I gave him, uh,
$250 for... I bought it.

16:42.000 --> 16:44.172
-Who'’d you give $250 to?

16:44.206 --> 16:46.931
-To the guy who claimed
that it was his.

16:46.965 --> 16:49.413
-You know this guy pretty well?
-Not well.

16:49.448 --> 16:51.655
I-- I thought I did,
but not well enough, I guess.

16:51.689 --> 16:54.551
-Not well enough?
I also wanna talk--
talk to you about,

16:54.586 --> 16:57.310
in your left pockets,
when we took you
into custody,

16:57.344 --> 16:59.689
um, found a bag.
-Yeah?

16:59.724 --> 17:02.862
What'’s-- What's in that bag?

17:02.896 --> 17:04.827
-I didn'’t even know
it was in my pocket.

17:04.862 --> 17:07.482
-What is it?
-I didn'’t even know
it was in my pocket.

17:07.517 --> 17:11.034
-Well, it'’s-- it's a bag
of meth... okay?

17:15.310 --> 17:17.000
You didn'’t know
that you had that on you?

17:17.034 --> 17:21.448
-No...
-That'’s a pretty decent amount
of meth, Stevie.

17:21.482 --> 17:25.551
-No, '’cause-- when I--
'’cause, um, when I--

17:25.586 --> 17:30.448
I was... I felt, like,
her grabbin'’ me,

17:30.482 --> 17:31.758
but I thought
she was just hangin'’ on

17:31.793 --> 17:34.379
when the--
when you blooped us.

17:34.413 --> 17:38.172
And I-- And I was, like--
but I wasn'’t really worried
about that,

17:38.206 --> 17:39.896
I didn'’t even think
nothin'’ of it.

17:39.931 --> 17:43.137
-Okay...
-So, yeah... I was, like...

17:46.413 --> 17:48.827
-Did you think
that she put that
in your pocket?

17:48.862 --> 17:51.551
-Mm-hm.
-Okay.

17:51.586 --> 17:55.379
Um, your-- your pockets
are kind of peculiar.

17:55.413 --> 17:57.758
You know, there--
there'’s a zipper on 'em.

17:57.793 --> 18:01.448
-Yeah...
-Okay. Did you have your pockets
zipped up or unzipped.

18:01.482 --> 18:03.137
-Unzipped.
-Unzipped?

18:03.172 --> 18:05.758
-Mm.
-'’Cause both of 'em
were zipped up...

18:05.793 --> 18:09.172
-No.
-...and I had to unzip them
to be able to search them.

18:11.206 --> 18:13.034
-I...
-Normally, if you'’re
on a bike like this,

18:13.068 --> 18:15.827
it makes sense that,
you know, you need
to zip '’em up

18:15.862 --> 18:18.586
so it kinda makes sense
that you would
zip them up.

18:18.620 --> 18:19.862
Doesn'’t it?

18:19.896 --> 18:21.310
-No.
-Okay.

18:21.344 --> 18:22.827
-No.

18:22.862 --> 18:25.172
-Is he like a boyfriend
to you or what?
-Just a friend.

18:25.206 --> 18:28.896
-Okay.
Um... tell me about the stop,
when I was behind you,

18:28.931 --> 18:31.206
somebody tossed somethin'’.
-I don'’t know.

18:31.241 --> 18:35.482
-You don'’t know?
-'’Cause we got fingerprint--
We can get fingerprints

18:35.517 --> 18:37.448
on it.
I know you guys aren'’t
wearing gloves.

18:37.482 --> 18:38.965
Is this something
you just wanna own up to

18:39.000 --> 18:44.310
or is this somethin'’...
If it'’s yours, it's yours.

18:44.344 --> 18:46.551
I just wanna
get the truth out of both
of your guys'’ stories.

18:46.586 --> 18:48.896
-Yeah... dropped it.
-You dropped it?

18:48.931 --> 18:51.896
-Mm.
-Was it in your pocket
or what?

18:51.931 --> 18:54.896
-No, it was in my bra.
-It was in your bra?
You just get scared?

18:54.931 --> 18:56.172
-Mm-hm.
-Okay.

18:56.206 --> 18:59.206
Your friend here says
that during our traffic stop,

18:59.241 --> 19:04.413
uh, that you put some more
meth in his pocket.
Is that true?

19:04.448 --> 19:07.275
Did you put, that,
'’cause he had a baggie
of meth in his pocket.

19:07.310 --> 19:09.862
Is that his?
-That'’s gotta be his,
'’cause I didn't...

19:09.896 --> 19:11.793
-It'’s his?
You didn'’t put it
in his pocket?

19:11.827 --> 19:14.517
-I didn'’t even know he had any.
-Okay, you didn'’t even know
he had the meth?

19:14.551 --> 19:17.793
Okay, so you'’re just gonna go
for the possession of meth
and drug paraphernalia.

19:17.827 --> 19:20.655
We'’re not gonna do
the-- the stolen bike
or anything on you, okay?

19:20.689 --> 19:22.241
-Okay.

19:24.620 --> 19:26.310
-Hey, Stevie.
Well, we talked with her.

19:26.344 --> 19:29.793
She told us
that she didn'’t put anything
in your pocket whatsoever.

19:29.827 --> 19:31.724
-Uh, I didn'’t have it.
I didn'’t have it.

19:31.758 --> 19:36.034
-With the fact they'’re
your pants, and they have
zippers, and they--

19:36.068 --> 19:39.275
they were all zipped up,
and I had to unzip them
to get the meth

19:39.310 --> 19:42.103
outta your pockets, so tonight,
you'’re gonna be booked
for the possession

19:42.137 --> 19:44.689

of methamphetamine,

19:44.724 --> 19:48.137
