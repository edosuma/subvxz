WEBVTT

00:01.172 --> 00:02.533
PREVIOUSLY ON...

00:02.533 --> 00:04.535
SUSAN LEFT TOWN
WITH A SECRET AGENDA.

00:04.535 --> 00:06.207
WHERE ARE YOU OFF TO?

00:06.207 --> 00:08.039
I'M JUST VISITING
SOME FAMILY.

00:08.039 --> 00:10.341
WELL, HAVE A GOOD TRIP.

00:10.341 --> 00:12.643
CARLOS WAS HEADED BACK
TO REHAB.

00:12.643 --> 00:13.744
YOU JUST WORRY
ABOUT GETTING BETTER.

00:13.744 --> 00:16.286
I CAN HOLD DOWN THE FORT,
NO PROBLEM.

00:16.286 --> 00:19.320
TOM'S TRIP WITH HIS GIRLFRIEND
WAS ENCOURAGED.

00:19.320 --> 00:22.022
I THINK YOU SHOULD GO
TO PARIS.

00:22.022 --> 00:27.228
AND BREE RECEIVED
ANOTHER MYSTERIOUS LETTER.

00:33.234 --> 00:37.268
IT'S ALWAYS EASY TO KNOW
WHO OUR FRIENDS ARE.

00:37.268 --> 00:41.041
THEY'RE THE ONES WHO TELL US
WHEN WE LOOK RIDICULOUS....

00:41.041 --> 00:45.716
OR WHEN
WE'RE DELUDING OURSELVES...

00:45.716 --> 00:49.250
OR WHEN WE'VE HAD ENOUGH.

00:50.721 --> 00:55.226
BUT ONLY THE BEST OF FRIENDS
WILL TELL YOU THE TRUTH,

00:55.226 --> 00:56.587
EVEN WHEN THEY KNOW...

00:56.587 --> 00:58.229
WHAT THE HELL IS THIS?

00:58.229 --> 00:59.760
IT WILL UPSET YOU.

00:59.760 --> 01:02.763
THAT'S WHAT I FOUND
IN MY MAILBOX.

01:02.763 --> 01:05.266
"YOU'RE WELCOME"?
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

01:05.266 --> 01:07.398
DON'T YOU RECOGNIZE
THE STATIONERY?

01:07.398 --> 01:10.341
IT'S THE SAME
AS MARY ALICE'S LETTER,

01:10.341 --> 01:12.203
AND I GOT IT
RIGHT AFTER CHUCK'S FUNERAL.

01:12.203 --> 01:14.275
YOU THINK THIS IS WHO
KILLED CHUCK?

01:14.275 --> 01:16.477
WELL, IT'S THE ONLY
LOGICAL EXPLANATION.

01:16.477 --> 01:19.150
THERE'S NOTHING LOGICAL
ABOUT ANY OF THIS.

01:19.150 --> 01:21.112
DON'T YOU REMEMBER
THE FIRST NOTE?

01:21.112 --> 01:23.484
YEAH, WHOEVER WROTE THAT
WAS THREATENING US.

01:23.484 --> 01:25.656
EXACTLY.
SO NOW ALL OF A SUDDEN,

01:25.656 --> 01:27.087
THIS PERSON
WHO "KNOWS WHAT WE DID"

01:27.087 --> 01:29.590
AND IS "GOING TO TELL"
IS NOW KILLING COPS FOR US?

01:29.590 --> 01:30.791
DOESN'T MAKE SENSE.

01:30.791 --> 01:32.623
YEAH, BUT THE TIMING.

01:32.623 --> 01:34.225
IT IS WEIRD.

01:36.667 --> 01:38.399
SO WHAT'S THE DEAL
WITH US?

01:40.171 --> 01:41.472
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

01:41.472 --> 01:44.205
ARE WE STILL MAD
AT EACH OTHER?

01:44.205 --> 01:46.677
I THINK SO.

01:46.677 --> 01:49.180
OKAY. JUST ASKING.

01:51.282 --> 01:53.244
WELL, WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO
ABOUT THIS?

01:53.244 --> 01:55.286
WHAT CAN WE DO?
WE DON'T KNOW WHO WROTE IT.

01:55.286 --> 01:56.387
WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY WANT.

01:56.387 --> 01:57.488
WE DON'T KNOW
WHAT THEY'RE GONNA DO NEXT.

01:57.488 --> 02:00.251
IS THERE ANYTHING WE DO KNOW?

02:00.251 --> 02:04.124
WELL... WE KNOW WHO THESE
LETTERS ARE BEING SENT TO.

02:04.124 --> 02:06.297
WHAT'S THAT SUPPOSED
TO MEAN?

02:06.297 --> 02:07.698
YOU'RE THE ONE WHO KEEPS
FINDING THESE THINGS.

02:07.698 --> 02:09.400
YOU TELL ME.

02:09.400 --> 02:11.902
I DON'T LIKE
YOUR ACCUSATORY TONE.

02:11.902 --> 02:13.164
WELL,
I'D USE A DIFFERENT TONE,

02:13.164 --> 02:16.136
BUT I'M TRYING TO ACCUSE YOU
OF SOMETHING.
 GABY!

02:16.136 --> 02:17.208
YOU HAVE TO ADMIT, BREE,
THERE DOES SEEM TO BE A LINK

02:17.208 --> 02:20.241
BETWEEN YOU AND MR. CREEPY
LETTER WRITING GUY.

02:20.241 --> 02:21.742
I DON'T BELIEVE THIS.

02:21.742 --> 02:23.314
WHY ELSE WOULD THEY KEEP
SENDING YOU THE NOTES?

02:23.314 --> 02:25.416
WHY NOT SEND COPIES
TO ALL OF US?

02:25.416 --> 02:27.318
THIS IS NOT ABOUT ME.

02:27.318 --> 02:29.550
AND IF YOU TWO ARE GONNA
JUST SIT THERE AND BLAME ME

02:29.550 --> 02:34.355
FOR THE ACTIONS
OF SOME PSYCHOPATH, THEN...

02:34.355 --> 02:36.857
I'M JUST GONNA GO HOME.

02:41.192 --> 02:43.194
I SAY WE FORGIVE EACH OTHER
AND JUST STAY MAD AT BREE.

02:43.194 --> 02:44.395
DONE.

02:44.395 --> 02:48.499
YES, ONLY YOUR FRIENDS
WILL TELL YOU THE TRUTH.

02:48.499 --> 02:52.403
SO WHEN THEY WARN YOU
ABOUT SOMEONE SUSPICIOUS,

02:52.403 --> 02:58.679
MAYBE YOU SHOULD LISTEN
TO THEM.

03:11.722 --> 03:14.665
(Mary Alice)
SUSAN DELFINO WAS ON A MISSION,

03:14.665 --> 03:18.329
AND SHE HAD PLANNED IT DOWN
TO THE LAST DETAIL.

03:18.329 --> 03:22.273
SHE BROUGHT
THE PROPER IDENTIFICATION,

03:22.273 --> 03:26.507
SHE MAPPED OUT
THE CORRECT ROUTE,

03:26.507 --> 03:31.382
AND SHE BROUGHT PLENTY OF CASH
FOR EMERGENCIES.

03:31.382 --> 03:35.215
BUT THE ONE SMALL DETAIL
SHE HADN'T PLANNED...

03:35.215 --> 03:38.919
WAS WHAT TO DO
ONCE SHE GOT THERE.

03:38.919 --> 03:40.921
MIKE, I'VE GOT A PROBLEM.

03:40.921 --> 03:42.893
OH, WHAT'S WRONG?
YOU CAN'T FIND THE HOUSE?

03:42.893 --> 03:45.396
NO, I'M STANDING
IN FRONT OF IT RIGHT NOW.

03:45.396 --> 03:46.927
THEN WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?

03:46.927 --> 03:49.930
I HAVE NO IDEA
HOW TO GET INSIDE.

03:49.930 --> 03:52.733
YOU JUST SPENT AN ENTIRE DAY
ON A PLANE.

03:52.733 --> 03:54.405
YOU DIDN'T GIVE THIS
ANY THOUGHT AT ALL?

03:54.405 --> 03:56.837
I WAS GOING TO,
AND THEN I GOT CAUGHT UP

03:56.837 --> 03:59.710
IN AN IN-FLIGHT MOVIE.
IT WAS ABOUT A DOLPHIN

03:59.710 --> 04:02.473
WHO JOINS AN INNER CITY
WATER POLO TEAM, AND--

04:02.473 --> 04:03.674
SUSAN!

04:03.674 --> 04:05.446
Oh, my God.

04:05.446 --> 04:06.977
THIS WAS THE STUPIDEST IDEA
EVER, WASN'T IT?

04:06.977 --> 04:10.481
No, you did this because
you're a good person.

04:10.481 --> 04:13.424
HONEY, JUST LEAVE SOME FLOWERS
AND COME BACK HOME.

04:13.424 --> 04:16.427
I can't.
I came here for a reason.

04:16.427 --> 04:19.560
I HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT
ALEJANDRO'S FAMILY IS OKAY.

04:19.560 --> 04:22.863
I JUST NEED TO FIGURE OUT SOME
COVER STORY TO GET IN THERE.

04:22.863 --> 04:24.635
YOU'RE A LITTLE EARLY!

04:24.635 --> 04:26.266
HUH?

04:26.266 --> 04:29.269
OH, COULDN'T WANT TO TAKE
THE FIRST LOOK, COULD YOU?

04:29.269 --> 04:30.901
WHAT?

04:30.901 --> 04:34.305
OH, RELAX.
I'M OKAY WITH EARLY BIRDS.

04:34.305 --> 04:36.677
CONNIE THOMAS, THOMAS REALTY.

04:36.677 --> 04:39.810
OFFICIALLY, THE OPEN HOUSE
DOESN'T START FOR AN HOUR,

04:39.810 --> 04:43.283
BUT IF YOU HELP ME LAY OUT
THE FINGER SANDWICHES,

04:43.283 --> 04:47.518
I'LL LET YOU SNEAK
THE FIRST PEEK. COME ON!

04:47.518 --> 04:51.362
MIKE, I'VE GOTTA GO.
I'M ABOUT TO BUY A HOUSE.
 (beep)

04:51.362 --> 04:54.695
LISTEN, ALL I'M ASKING FOR
IS AN EXTENSION.

04:54.695 --> 04:56.296
ONCE I GET A MODEL UNIT OPEN,

04:56.296 --> 04:58.499
THESE CONDOS ARE GONNA BE
SELLING LIKE CRAZY.

04:58.499 --> 05:00.631
(knock on door)

05:00.631 --> 05:02.833
HI. WHAT'S GOING ON?

05:02.833 --> 05:04.705
HEY, I WAS SITTING OVER
AT BREE'S,

05:04.705 --> 05:07.478
AND I THOUGHT...
(clicks tongue) I MISS HIM.

05:07.478 --> 05:10.981
YEAH, I MISS YOU, TOO. BUT I CAN
GET THE NUMBERS FOR YOU.

05:10.981 --> 05:13.083
HOLD ON. HERE.

05:13.083 --> 05:17.348
UH, DID YOU HEAR ME?
I SAID I MISS YOU.

05:17.348 --> 05:19.520
UH, THAT'S MY GIRLFRIEND.
JUST--J--

05:19.520 --> 05:24.054
(scoffs) HEY.
I DON'T MISS PEOPLE.

05:24.054 --> 05:25.356
I FORGET THEM.

05:25.356 --> 05:27.898
I IGNORE THEM.
I VERBALLY ABUSE THEM,

05:27.898 --> 05:31.331
BUT I AM DEFINITELY NOT
A MISSING-PEOPLE KIND OF PERSON.

05:31.331 --> 05:32.833
CAN YOU HANG ON
FOR A SECOND?

05:32.833 --> 05:35.506
LISTEN, I LOVE THAT YOU MISS ME,
BUT I'M REALLY BUSY RIGHT NOW.

05:35.506 --> 05:37.508
TALK LATER.
HEY, YOU STILL THERE?

05:37.508 --> 05:39.970
YEAH, I'VE GOT THE NUMBERS
RIGHT HERE.
 (scoffs)

05:39.970 --> 05:43.043
YEAH. YEAH.

05:45.516 --> 05:47.948
LET ME TELL YOU WHAT
THE MAN FROM DOWN UNDER

05:47.948 --> 05:50.981
WHO WILL NEVER AGAIN
 BE DOWN UNDER JUST DID TO ME.

05:52.723 --> 05:54.024
WHAT'S WRONG?

05:54.024 --> 05:56.527
NOTHING.

05:56.527 --> 05:59.359
OH, GOD,
IT'S LIKE PULLING TEETH.

05:59.359 --> 06:01.392
I SAW YOU TALKING
TO GABY AND LYNETTE.

06:01.392 --> 06:03.494
DID THEY SAY SOMETHING
TO UPSET YOU?

06:03.494 --> 06:06.837
I DON'T WANT TO DISCUSS IT.

06:06.837 --> 06:08.639
THEY SUGGESTED BOTOX,
DIDN'T THEY?

06:08.639 --> 06:10.541
NO. WHY WOULD YOU SAY THAT?

06:10.541 --> 06:12.603
YOU'RE HAVING WINE
BEFORE LUNCH.

06:12.603 --> 06:16.477
THAT'S WHAT I DID THE FIRST TIME
SOMEONE SAID I NEEDED BOTOX.

06:16.477 --> 06:17.678
YES, I AM UPSET,
BUT IT'S PRIVATE,

06:17.678 --> 06:20.511
AND I WANNA PROCESS IT...
(whispers) PRIVATELY.

06:20.511 --> 06:23.454
OHH, KEEPING STUFF INSIDE
IS HOW YOU ENDED UP

06:23.454 --> 06:24.955
IN THAT MOTEL WITH A GUN.

06:24.955 --> 06:28.819
RELAX.
I AM NO LONGER SUICIDAL.

06:28.819 --> 06:30.461
YOU DON'T WANNA TALK? FINE.

06:30.461 --> 06:33.524
BUT I'M NOT GONNA LET YOU
SIT HERE FOR THE NEXT FEW DAYS

06:33.524 --> 06:35.796
MOPING ABOUT GOD KNOWS WHAT.

06:35.796 --> 06:37.498
WE'RE GOING OUT.

06:37.498 --> 06:39.099
WHAT?

06:39.099 --> 06:41.171
I KNOW ALL SORTS
OF NAUGHTY PLACES

06:41.171 --> 06:43.674
FILLED WITH ALL SORTS
OF NAUGHTY MEN.

06:43.674 --> 06:45.976
BE READY TO LEAVE BY 8:00
AND TRY TO WEAR SOMETHING

06:45.976 --> 06:48.509
THAT DOESN'T SCREAM
"FRIGID SCHOOLMARM."

06:48.509 --> 06:50.481
NO! NO, NO, LISTEN TO ME.

06:50.481 --> 06:52.443
I DON'T WANNA GO OUT. I DON'T
WANNA TALK ABOUT MY FEELINGS,

06:52.443 --> 06:55.746
AND I DON'T WANT YOU HERE
ANYMORE, SO PLEASE...

06:55.746 --> 06:58.849
GO HOME.

06:58.849 --> 06:59.990
(sighs)
 (wine pouring)

06:59.990 --> 07:01.852
WOW. ANOTHER GLASS OF WINE?

07:04.525 --> 07:06.156
(sighs)

07:06.156 --> 07:08.198
IT'S JUST,
I'VE NEVER SEEN YOU DRINK.

07:08.198 --> 07:11.702
YOU KNOW WHAT? YOU'RE RIGHT.
I COULD USE A NIGHT OUT.

07:11.702 --> 07:12.703
REALLY?

07:12.703 --> 07:15.966
YES, BUT MY WARDROBE
IS A BIT FROSTY.

07:15.966 --> 07:17.768
DO YOU THINK YOU COULD
RUN BACK TO YOUR HOUSE

07:17.768 --> 07:20.541
AND FIND SOMETHING
IN YOUR CLOSET FOR ME?

07:20.541 --> 07:21.972
SOMETHING SEXY.

07:21.972 --> 07:24.945
ABSOLUTELY.
OH, BREE, YOU'LL SEE.

07:24.945 --> 07:29.119
A NIGHT OUT IS EXACTLY WHAT
YOU NEED TO LIFT YOUR SPIRITS.

07:31.722 --> 07:35.886
(door opens and closes)

07:43.634 --> 07:45.496
(sighs)

07:47.868 --> 07:49.640
I'M TIRED.

07:49.640 --> 07:51.502
I KNOW, SWEETIE.

07:51.502 --> 07:54.505
TRYING TO TEACH YOU
THE VALUE OF HARD WORK.

07:57.578 --> 08:01.512
(sighs) IF YOU'RE WONDERING WHY
I'M PUSHING THE LEAVES

08:01.512 --> 08:04.014
OVER TO MS. KINSKY'S HOUSE,

08:04.014 --> 08:05.516
IT'S 'CAUSE I'M TRYING
TO TEACH HER

08:05.516 --> 08:07.487
THE VALUE OF HARD WORK, TOO.

08:07.487 --> 08:09.560
(sighs)
 (car door closes)

08:09.560 --> 08:11.662
MRS. SOLIS, HELLO.

08:11.662 --> 08:14.725
HEY... CARLOS' SECRETARY.

08:14.725 --> 08:15.726
MARILYN.

08:15.726 --> 08:17.868
MARILYN, OF COURSE. YES.
I KNEW THAT.

08:17.868 --> 08:19.600
WHAT CAN I DO FOR YOU,
MARILYN?

08:19.600 --> 08:20.701
I WAS IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD,

08:20.701 --> 08:22.202
AND I THOUGHT I'D BRING BY
MR. SOLIS' MAIL.

08:22.202 --> 08:23.904
THANK YOU.
 BY THE WAY,

08:23.904 --> 08:26.607
ANY CHANCE THAT TOMORROW
HE CAN GET OUT OF HIS...

08:26.607 --> 08:27.738
(whispers) REHAB?

08:27.738 --> 08:30.581
WHY DO YOU NEED CARLOS?
 HE'S BEEN TRYING TO LAND

08:30.581 --> 08:32.042
THIS BRITISH FIRM
AS A CLIENT FOR MONTHS.

08:32.042 --> 08:33.212
THEY'RE IN TOWN
FOR A COUPLE OF DAYS,

08:33.212 --> 08:35.215
AND I THINK A LITTLE
WINING AND DINING

08:35.215 --> 08:36.515
WOULD SEAL THE DEAL.

08:36.515 --> 08:38.589
WELL, I DON'T THINK
IT'S A GOOD IDEA

08:38.589 --> 08:41.520
TO SPRING CARLOS OUT OF REHAB
FOR "WINING."

08:41.520 --> 08:43.894
ISN'T THERE SOMEONE ELSE
WHO CAN MEET WITH THEM?

08:43.894 --> 08:45.095
WHAT ABOUT THE OLD GUY?

08:45.095 --> 08:46.727
ROBERT? HE RETIRED.

08:46.727 --> 08:49.159
OH. OH!
HOW ABOUT THE FAT CHICK?

08:49.159 --> 08:50.931
CELESTE? MATERNITY LEAVE.

08:50.931 --> 08:54.234
THE NERVE OF THESE PEOPLE.

08:54.234 --> 08:56.937
SORRY, MARILYN. YOU WIN SOME,
YOU LOSE SOME, RIGHT?

08:56.937 --> 08:58.168
EXCEPT IN THIS CASE,

08:58.168 --> 09:00.811
WE'RE LOSING
A $90 MILLION ACCOUNT.

09:00.811 --> 09:04.645
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.
$90 MILLION?

09:07.547 --> 09:10.851
AND YOU THINK ALL IT WILL TAKE
IS A LITTLE WINING AND DINING?

09:10.851 --> 09:13.553
WHY DON'T YOU GO AHEAD
AND SET UP THAT MEETING?

09:13.553 --> 09:15.325
I HAVE AN IDEA.

09:15.325 --> 09:16.787
OKAY, I'LL GET RIGHT ON IT.

09:18.959 --> 09:21.762
DO YOU KNOW WHY
THE OWNERS ARE SELLING?

09:21.762 --> 09:25.135
OH. THAT'S A BIT
OF A SCANDAL.

09:25.135 --> 09:27.097
I REALLY SHOULDN'T SAY.

09:27.097 --> 09:28.969
OKAY.

09:28.969 --> 09:33.573
THE HUSBAND DISAPPEARED
FOUR MONTHS AGO,

09:33.573 --> 09:35.706
AND HE HASN'T BEEN
HEARD FROM SINCE.

09:35.706 --> 09:39.650
I THINK IT'S DRUGS
OR MAYBE ANOTHER WOMAN.

09:39.650 --> 09:42.753
COULD BE ANYTHING.

09:42.753 --> 09:43.684
POOR CHILD.

09:43.684 --> 09:45.756
STEPCHILD.

09:45.756 --> 09:48.188
OH, BUT YOU GOT
THE "POOR" PART RIGHT.

09:48.188 --> 09:49.860
THE WIFE HAD TO TAKE
A SECOND JOB,

09:49.860 --> 09:53.593
AND NOW SHE STILL
CAN'T EVEN MAKE ENDS MEET.

09:53.593 --> 09:54.695
(thud)

09:54.695 --> 09:56.627
YEAH.

09:56.627 --> 09:57.968
TELL THE BUYERS
HOW DESPERATE WE ARE.

09:57.968 --> 09:59.970
THAT'LL JACK UP
THE SALE PRICE.

09:59.970 --> 10:03.133
OH. MRS. SANCHEZ, SO SORRY.

10:03.133 --> 10:05.005
I DIDN'T REALIZE
YOU WERE COMING BACK SO SOON.

10:05.005 --> 10:06.777
I BET.

10:06.777 --> 10:09.309
BY THE WAY, YOU DROPPED
SOME OF YOUR FLYERS ON MY LAWN.

10:09.309 --> 10:13.684
OH, I SHOULD GET THOSE.
EXCUSE ME.

10:13.684 --> 10:15.646
(scoffs)

10:15.646 --> 10:19.049
IT'S NOT COMPLETELY HER FAULT.
I WAS SORT OF... PRYING.

10:19.049 --> 10:20.390
SORRY.

10:20.390 --> 10:22.853
ARE YOU SORRY ENOUGH
TO BUY MY HOUSE?

10:22.853 --> 10:27.327
OH, WELL, UH...
ACTUALLY, I WAS...

10:27.327 --> 10:29.629
LOOKING FOR SOMETHING
A LITTLE LARGER.

10:29.629 --> 10:32.703
WELL, THAT'S TOO BAD.

10:37.167 --> 10:42.743
MAYBE, UH, THERE'S SOMETHING
THAT I CAN DO FOR YOU.

10:44.244 --> 10:49.019
BECAUSE... I AM A COLLECTOR
OF AMERICANA...

10:49.019 --> 10:52.082
AND SOME OF
YOUR FABULOUS KNICKKNACKS

10:52.082 --> 10:54.084
HAVE REALLY CAUGHT MY EYE.

10:54.084 --> 10:56.186
I HAVE FABULOUS KNICKKNACKS?

10:56.186 --> 10:57.988
YOU SURE DO. (chuckles)

10:57.988 --> 11:02.833
LIKE--LIKE THIS,
FOR INSTANCE.

11:02.833 --> 11:04.034
THOSE ARE LEGOS.

11:04.034 --> 11:06.737
(chuckles)
I KNOW WHAT THEY ARE.

11:06.737 --> 11:09.139
BUT WHAT YOU DON'T KNOW

11:09.139 --> 11:13.273
IS THAT THESE ARE...
PHASE ONE LEGOS.

11:13.273 --> 11:15.105
VERY RARE.

11:15.105 --> 11:19.079
I WOULD LOVE TO BUY THEM

11:19.079 --> 11:20.680
IF YOU'RE WILLING TO SELL.

11:20.680 --> 11:23.113
SERIOUSLY?

11:23.113 --> 11:25.385
'CAUSE I GOT, LIKE,
A WHOLE COFFEE CAN

11:25.385 --> 11:27.387
FULL OF THOSE.

11:27.387 --> 11:29.790
(laughs) THAT'S... JACKPOT.

11:29.790 --> 11:33.824
OH! (laughs) I-I, UM,
I WILL TAKE THEM ALL.

11:33.824 --> 11:34.865
HEY, MARISA!

11:34.865 --> 11:37.167
WHAT?

11:37.167 --> 11:38.769
THIS LADY'S BUYING
ALL YOUR OLD LEGOS.

11:38.769 --> 11:40.070
YOU STILL HAVE THAT BOX
FULL OF HEADLESS BARBIES?

11:40.070 --> 11:42.202
OH! OH, THAT'S OKAY.
I'M GOOD. UH...

11:42.202 --> 11:44.775
(paper rips)
 HERE... IS YOUR CHECK.

11:46.376 --> 11:49.339
OH, I THINK YOU ADDED
AN EXTRA ZERO.

11:49.339 --> 11:54.714
THAT'S BECAUSE I...
I WANNA DO SOMETHING TO HELP.

11:54.714 --> 11:57.748
YOU KNOW, BECAUSE OF YOUR...
SITUATION.

11:57.748 --> 11:59.149
LOOK,
WHATEVER MY REALTOR SAID,

11:59.149 --> 12:00.490
YOU DON'T GOTTA FEEL SORRY
FOR ME.

12:00.490 --> 12:02.823
I KNOW MY HUSBAND
WILL COME BACK.

12:02.823 --> 12:08.728
BUT... ON THE OFF CHANCE
THAT HE... DOESN'T,

12:08.728 --> 12:12.262
PLEASE, TAKE MY CHECK.

12:12.262 --> 12:15.866
OKAY. THANK YOU.

12:15.866 --> 12:18.368
(sighs)

12:18.368 --> 12:20.841
BUT STOP GIVING ME
THE SAD EYES.

12:20.841 --> 12:23.213
RAMON DOES THIS SORT OF THING
ALL THE TIME.

12:23.213 --> 12:25.816
HE GOES ON A LITTLE BENDER,
THEN COMES HOME,

12:25.816 --> 12:28.779
BUT MOSTLY, HE'S A GOOD HUSBAND
AND A LOVING FATHER.

12:41.191 --> 12:44.294
WELL, THANK YOU AGAIN.

12:44.294 --> 12:45.966
IT WAS A...

12:45.966 --> 12:48.869
PLEASURE DOING BUSINESS
WITH YOU.
 (sighs)

12:48.869 --> 12:51.301
YOU'VE REALLY
HELPED US OUT.

13:04.354 --> 13:06.086
♪ TA-DA ♪
 WOW, THAT SMELLS GREAT.

13:06.086 --> 13:07.487
WHERE'D YOU LEARN
TO MAKE A POT PIE?

13:07.487 --> 13:09.019
I LOOKED IT UP
ON A LITTLE PLACE

13:09.019 --> 13:10.160
YOU KIDS CALL THE INTERNET.

13:10.160 --> 13:12.262
THIS IS NICE, HUH?

13:12.262 --> 13:13.523
PERFECT FAMILY DINNER.

13:19.029 --> 13:20.871
IT'S DOING IT AGAIN.

13:20.871 --> 13:22.502
NO, IT'S NOT.
EVERYTHING'S PERFECT.

13:22.502 --> 13:24.074
IT'S FLICKERING, MOM.

13:24.074 --> 13:26.036
HAD TO HAPPEN WHILE DAD
WAS IN PARIS, RIGHT?

13:26.036 --> 13:28.008
HEY! WHAT'S THAT SUPPOSED
TO MEAN?

13:28.008 --> 13:31.842
I CAN HANDLE IT. I'LL JUST
DO WHAT YOUR DAD DOES.

13:31.842 --> 13:33.283
WHAT DOES YOUR DAD DO?

13:33.283 --> 13:36.486
HE GOES TO THE CIRCUIT BOX
AND... JIGGLES SOMETHING.

13:39.549 --> 13:42.322
I CAN DO THAT.

13:42.322 --> 13:43.954
AHA.

13:43.954 --> 13:48.458
YOU KNOW EXACTLY WHAT
HE JIGGLES OR... NEVER MIND.

13:48.458 --> 13:49.499
I'LL DO IT.

13:49.499 --> 13:51.161
(switch clicks)
 ANYTHING?

13:52.302 --> 13:55.135
YOU'RE MAKING IT WORSE.
 WAIT, WAIT.

13:55.135 --> 13:56.436
THIS IS IT.
THIS IS DEFINITELY IT.

13:56.436 --> 13:57.968
(switch clicks,
electricity buzzes)

14:02.072 --> 14:04.144
WELL, IT STOPPED FLICKERING.

14:04.144 --> 14:05.445
WHAT TIME IS IT IN PARIS?

14:05.445 --> 14:07.918
NO. WE ARE NOT GOING TO
CALL YOUR DAD.

14:07.918 --> 14:10.480
WE JUST NEED
SOME FLASHLIGHTS.

14:10.480 --> 14:14.254
WHERE DOES YOUR DAD
KEEP THE FLASHLIGHTS?

14:14.254 --> 14:15.886
HUH.

14:21.261 --> 14:22.392
BOSS.

14:22.392 --> 14:25.095
HI, MIKE.
EVERYTHING OKAY?

14:25.095 --> 14:27.067
WELL, I, UH, I JUST
BOUNCED A CHECK.

14:27.067 --> 14:28.999
OUCH.

14:28.999 --> 14:31.041
AND IT WAS TO BUY BATS FOR
M.J.'s LITTLE LEAGUE TEAM, SO...

14:31.041 --> 14:32.973
EMBARRASSING.
 EXACTLY.

14:32.973 --> 14:34.574
SO I CALLED MY BANK
TO TEAR 'EM A NEW ONE,

14:34.574 --> 14:36.006
AND THEY TOLD ME
MY LAST PAYCHECK

14:36.006 --> 14:38.949
WAS RETURNED
FOR INSUFFICIENT FUNDS...

14:38.949 --> 14:40.110
BOSS.

14:40.110 --> 14:42.612
OH. LOOK, UH...

14:42.612 --> 14:44.084
(bills rustling)

14:44.084 --> 14:45.355
LET ME COVER THAT FOR YOU.

14:45.355 --> 14:48.618
I'M SORRY ABOUT THAT. I DON'T
KNOW WHAT COULD HAVE HAPPENED.

14:48.618 --> 14:49.960
I JUST SWITCHED BANKS.

14:49.960 --> 14:52.892
MAYBE THERE WAS SOME KIND
OF PROBLEM WITH THE TRANSFER.

14:52.892 --> 14:55.365
YOU SURE THAT'S IT?

14:55.365 --> 14:58.368
I MEAN, I KNOW THE CONDO
PROJECT'S GOING A LITTLE SLOW.

14:58.368 --> 14:59.569
IS EVERYTHING OKAY?

14:59.569 --> 15:02.432
ABSOLUTELY.
NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT. HERE.

15:02.432 --> 15:05.075
GRAB THE KIDS
A FEW EXTRA BATS.

15:05.075 --> 15:08.278
OH, NO, I DON'T NEED A TIP.
UH, JUST--JUST MY PAY.

15:18.588 --> 15:21.091
HEY. DID YOU FIX IT?

15:21.091 --> 15:23.023
NO, BUT I FIGURED OUT
IT'S NOT THE LIGHT,

15:23.023 --> 15:24.154
SO I'M GOING OVER
THE BLUEPRINTS

15:24.154 --> 15:26.056
TO FIND OUT WHERE
THE REAL PROBLEM IS.

15:26.056 --> 15:27.998
OR YOU COULD JUST CALL
AN ELECTRICIAN.

15:27.998 --> 15:29.960
WHY DO THAT?

15:29.960 --> 15:32.032
I WENT ON THE INTERNET.
I DID A LITTLE RESEARCH.
 (refrigerator door opens)

15:32.032 --> 15:33.303
AND OTHER THAN A FEW
ELECTROCUTION STORIES,

15:33.303 --> 15:35.135
IT DOESN'T SOUND THAT HARD.

15:35.135 --> 15:37.407
SEEMS LIKE A LOT OF WORK.

15:37.407 --> 15:40.540
ALL DAD HAD TO DO WAS...
JIGGLE SOMETHING.

15:40.540 --> 15:44.274
YOU KNOW, THE JIGGLE
IS JUST A BAND-AID.

15:44.274 --> 15:47.017
THAT WAS YOUR DAD'S APPROACH
TO EVERYTHING.

15:47.017 --> 15:48.248
JUST PATCH IT UP
AND PRETEND IT'S FIXED.

15:48.248 --> 15:51.681
THAT'S WHY WE'VE HAD
THESE PROBLEMS ALL THESE YEARS.

15:53.253 --> 15:56.626
THE LIGHT.
I'M TALKING ABOUT THE LIGHT.

15:56.626 --> 15:58.188
(doorbell rings)

15:58.188 --> 15:59.159
AT LEAST THE DOORBELL'S
WORKING AGAIN.

15:59.159 --> 16:00.330
MM.

16:00.330 --> 16:03.233
(singsongy) HEY! HOW ARE YOU?

16:03.233 --> 16:07.037
UH-OH. THAT'S THE "HEY"
THAT MEANS "I NEED SOMETHING."

16:07.037 --> 16:09.339
NO, COME ON. THIS IS IMPORTANT.

16:09.339 --> 16:13.073
OKAY, CARLOS IS AWAY, AND I NEED
SOME HELP WITH HIS BUSINESS,

16:13.073 --> 16:16.046
AND YOU'RE THE ONLY FRIEND
I HAVE WHO KNOWS THIS STUFF.

16:16.046 --> 16:17.577
WHAT STUFF?
 I DON'T KNOW.

16:17.577 --> 16:19.349
SOME BIG BRITISH COMPANY.

16:19.349 --> 16:21.011
BENNETT SOMETHING.

16:21.011 --> 16:22.712
THE BENNETT GROUP?

16:22.712 --> 16:25.155
YEAH! SEE? YOU GET IT.

16:25.155 --> 16:27.117
ANYWAY, THEY'RE ON THE VERGE
OF SIGNING WITH CARLOS,

16:27.117 --> 16:28.458
AND SINCE HE'S NOT "FREE,"

16:28.458 --> 16:30.560
I THOUGHT I'D TAKE 'EM
TO DINNER AND CLOSE THE DEAL.

16:30.560 --> 16:33.363
YOU? HOW WOULD YOU EVEN
KNOW WHAT TO TALK ABOUT?

16:33.363 --> 16:36.226
HEY, THAT'S WHERE
YOU COME IN.

16:36.226 --> 16:38.128
YOU USED TO WORK FOR CARLOS.

16:38.128 --> 16:40.230
MAYBE YOU CAN GIVE ME
A FEW POINTERS.

16:40.230 --> 16:43.433
I HAVE SPENT MY LIFE LEARNING
ABOUT THE WORLD OF FINANCE.

16:43.433 --> 16:45.505
I CAN'T JUST TEACH IT TO YOU
IN A COUPLE OF WEEKS.

16:45.505 --> 16:48.007
COULD YOU TEACH IT TO ME
IN A COUPLE HOURS?

16:48.007 --> 16:49.179
'CAUSE
THE MEETING'S TOMORROW.

16:49.179 --> 16:50.780
GABY.

16:50.780 --> 16:52.582
I'M A FAST LEARNER, I SWEAR.

16:52.582 --> 16:54.544
AND FROM WHAT I UNDERSTAND,
THE DEAL'S AS GOOD AS DONE.

16:54.544 --> 16:57.347
THIS IS JUST A FORMALITY.

17:00.120 --> 17:03.022
(chuckles) OKAY. FINE.

17:03.022 --> 17:04.594
AH, COME BACK TONIGHT
AFTER THE KIDS ARE DONE.

17:04.594 --> 17:05.755
I'LL DO MY BEST.

17:05.755 --> 17:08.157
OH, YOU'RE THE GREATEST.
 YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.

17:08.157 --> 17:10.230
HEY, COULD YOU AT LEAST
BRING--

17:10.230 --> 17:12.031
BRING SOME WINE.
I'M ONE STEP AHEAD OF YOU.

17:12.031 --> 17:13.463
I WAS GOING TO SAY
CARLOS' FILES.

17:13.463 --> 17:16.266
OH, JEEZ.
THOSE ARE AT HIS OFFICE,

17:16.266 --> 17:19.339
AND THAT'S ALL THE WAY
ACROSS TOWN.

17:19.339 --> 17:20.710
(singsongy) HEY!

17:20.710 --> 17:22.372
NO.

17:34.454 --> 17:37.327
(indistinct conversations)

17:37.327 --> 17:39.559
OH, I DON'T SUPPOSE
THE BARTENDER

17:39.559 --> 17:41.761
HAS ANY ANTI-BACTERIAL WIPES.

17:41.761 --> 17:45.135
(sighs) YOU CAN ASK AGAIN,
BUT I DON'T THINK SO.

17:45.135 --> 17:46.536
WILL YOU STOP?

17:46.536 --> 17:49.539
THE FUN OF A PLACE LIKE THIS
IS GETTING GERMS ON YOUR ELBOWS.

17:49.539 --> 17:51.070
I DON'T UNDERSTAND
WHY ANYONE

17:51.070 --> 17:53.273
WOULD WANT TO COME
TO A DIVE LIKE THIS.

17:53.273 --> 17:54.844
YOU SAY "DIVE"
LIKE IT'S A BAD WORD.

17:54.844 --> 17:57.747
(gasps)
 LOOK AROUND.
PEOPLE ARE HAVING FUN.

17:57.747 --> 18:02.081
NOW LOOK IN THAT MIRROR, HMM?
NOT FUN.

18:02.081 --> 18:04.614
WHY ARE YOU SO UPTIGHT?

18:04.614 --> 18:07.617
WELL, COMPARED TO YOU,
A WOMAN WHO PAID FOR OUR DRINKS

18:07.617 --> 18:09.859
BY.. SHOWING OFF
THE BRONTE SISTERS.

18:09.859 --> 18:11.861
THE BRONTE SISTERS?

18:11.861 --> 18:15.495
JEEZ. EVEN YOUR BOOB JOKES
ARE REPRESSED.

18:15.495 --> 18:16.766
WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU?

18:16.766 --> 18:17.827
NOTHING HAPPENED TO ME.

18:17.827 --> 18:20.130
WELL, SOMEONE MADE YOU THIS WAY.
WAS IT YOUR MOTHER?

18:20.130 --> 18:22.202
MY MOTHER PASSED AWAY
WHEN I WAS 10.

18:22.202 --> 18:24.534
OHH. THAT EXPLAINS IT.

18:24.534 --> 18:26.776
REMEMBER MY MOM DIED
WHEN I WAS A KID, TOO.

18:26.776 --> 18:28.878
WHEN PARENTS DIE,
YOU CAN GO ONE OF TWO WAYS--

18:28.878 --> 18:33.613
DADDY'S LITTLE GIRL
OR DADDY'S LITTLE NIGHTMARE.

18:33.613 --> 18:36.216
WELL, I SUPPOSE MY FATHER
DID HAVE CERTAIN EXPECTATIONS.

18:36.216 --> 18:38.188
HE... RAISED ME TO BE A LADY,

18:38.188 --> 18:40.490
AND I'VE DONE MY BEST
TO MAKE HIM PROUD.

18:40.490 --> 18:41.691
MM, HELLO, REPRESSION.

18:41.691 --> 18:44.894
WELL, I'M GLAD THAT
HE INSISTED ON GOOD BEHAVIOR.

18:44.894 --> 18:47.357
YOUR DAD IS NOT HERE, BREE.

18:47.357 --> 18:49.699
NO ONE'S GONNA TELL HIM
IF YOU CUT LOOSE,

18:49.699 --> 18:51.761
HAVE A LITTLE FUN.

18:51.761 --> 18:55.805
(sighs) YOU LOOK HOT
IN MY DRESS.

18:55.805 --> 18:59.269
BE BAD. BE NAUGHTY.
HIT ON A STRANGER.

18:59.269 --> 19:01.841
I WOULDN'T TAKE A BREATH MINT
FROM THESE PEOPLE...

19:01.841 --> 19:05.175
AS IF ANY OF THEM
WOULD HAVE ONE.

19:05.175 --> 19:08.878
FINE. SIT HERE ALONE
LIKE DADDY WANTED.

19:08.878 --> 19:10.720
I'M MAD AT BEN.

19:10.720 --> 19:12.322
I NEED TO WORK OUT
THOSE ISSUES

19:12.322 --> 19:13.683
WITH STRANGE MEN
ON THE DANCE FLOOR.

19:13.683 --> 19:16.556
(gasps) YOU'RE GONNA LEAVE ME
SITTING HERE BY MYSELF?

19:16.556 --> 19:19.289
IT'S A DIVE, BREE.
DIVE IN.

19:24.534 --> 19:26.436
THE MAIN THING
THAT DISTINGUISHES YOU

19:26.436 --> 19:29.399
FROM A CORPORATE FIRM
IS CUSTOM BENCHMARKING.

19:29.399 --> 19:31.841
LET THEM KNOW YOU PROVIDE
SUPERIOR CUSTOMER SERVICE,

19:31.841 --> 19:33.273
EVEN THOUGH
YOUR RESPONSIBILITIES

19:33.273 --> 19:34.444
ARE NOT FIDUCIARY.

19:34.444 --> 19:36.706
OOH, "FIDUCIARY."
I LOVE HOW THAT SOUNDS.

19:36.706 --> 19:37.807
CAN YOU SPELL IT FOR ME?

19:37.807 --> 19:39.849
WELL, LET ME EXPLAIN IT FIRST.
 NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.

19:39.849 --> 19:42.612
YOUR EXPLANATIONS TAKE FOREVER.
JUST SPELL IT.

19:42.612 --> 19:43.813
GABY, YOU CAN'T WRITE DOWN
A BUNCH OF BUZZWORDS

19:43.813 --> 19:45.885
AND READ THEM OFF
A PIECE OF PAPER AT THE MEETING.

19:45.885 --> 19:48.918
GOOD POINT. I SHOULD HIDE
A PIECE OF PAPER.

19:48.918 --> 19:51.921
OR YOU COULD ACTUALLY
BUCKLE DOWN

19:51.921 --> 19:53.563
AND LEARN THE CONCEPTS.

19:53.563 --> 19:55.625
IT'S JUST FANCY LINGO.
YOU THROW IT AROUND.

19:55.625 --> 19:57.627
YOU SOUND SMART.
CLIENTS ARE HAPPY.

19:57.627 --> 19:59.399
I MEAN, WHO REALLY
UNDERSTANDS THIS STUFF?

19:59.399 --> 20:01.431
EVERYBODY.
 REALLY?

20:01.431 --> 20:04.904
EVERYBODY? (scoffs)
OKAY. HEY, PENNY.

20:04.904 --> 20:06.736
WHAT IS "FIDUCIARY" MEAN?

20:06.736 --> 20:09.239
UM, I THINK IT'S LIKE SOMEONE
WHO'S ALLOWED TO MANAGE

20:09.239 --> 20:12.582
TO SOMEONE ELSE'S MONEY--
LIKE... A BANK OR SOMETHING.

20:13.783 --> 20:16.746
OKAY. GUESS WHO'S GOING
TO THEIR PROM ALONE.

20:16.746 --> 20:18.888
LOOK, CAN WE TAKE A BREAK?
WE'VE BEEN AT THIS FOR HOURS.

20:18.888 --> 20:20.420
(taps key)
 43 MINUTES.

20:20.420 --> 20:22.422
WELL, IT FEELS LIKE HOURS.

20:22.422 --> 20:24.424
JUST GIVE ME A COUPLE MORE
SMART WORDS, AND WE'LL BE DONE.

20:24.424 --> 20:26.656
WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THEY HAVE
A QUESTION?

20:26.656 --> 20:28.798
YOU CAN'T JUST SPOUT OFF
A BUNCH OF TERMS

20:28.798 --> 20:30.330
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.

20:30.330 --> 20:31.801
OF COURSE I CAN.

20:31.801 --> 20:33.903
YOU THINK WHEN I WAS
A SPOKESMODEL AT CAR SHOWS

20:33.903 --> 20:36.966
I KNEW WHAT
RACK AND PINION STEERING WAS?

20:36.966 --> 20:39.238
I DIDN'T HAVE TO,
'CAUSE I HAD CHARM.

20:39.238 --> 20:41.811
AND A TIGHT LITTLE DRESS
THAT BARELY COVERED YOUR HOO-HA.

20:41.811 --> 20:43.773
I WONDER IF I STILL FIT
INTO THAT DRESS.

20:43.773 --> 20:45.815
WELL, HERE'S A THOUGHT.

20:45.815 --> 20:49.619
HOW ABOUT FOR ONCE IN YOUR LIFE
YOU APPLY YOURSELF?

20:49.619 --> 20:51.821
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

20:51.821 --> 20:52.922
IT MEANS FOR AS LONG
AS I'VE KNOWN YOU,

20:52.922 --> 20:56.025
YOU HAVE BEEN SKATING BY
ON YOUR LOOKS AND CHARM.

20:56.025 --> 20:58.458
FOR AS LONG AS
YOU'VE KNOWN ME?

20:58.458 --> 21:01.731
WOW, YOU'VE BEEN HOLDING
ON TO THAT FOR A LONG TIME.
 TELL ME I'M WRONG.

21:01.731 --> 21:02.762
NO, LYNETTE, I CAN'T.

21:02.762 --> 21:04.464
NO ONE CAN TELL YOU
YOU'RE WRONG,

21:04.464 --> 21:05.895
'CAUSE YOU'RE ALWAYS RIGHT.

21:05.895 --> 21:07.797
OKAY. WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?
 IT MEANS YOU'RE A KNOW-IT-ALL.

21:07.797 --> 21:11.941
I HAVE NEVER ONCE HEARD YOU SAY
THE WORDS "I DON'T KNOW."

21:11.941 --> 21:13.443
WELL, GET READY TO,

21:13.443 --> 21:15.845
BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW WHY
I AGREED TO HELP YOU.

21:15.845 --> 21:18.908
THIS IS
A COMPLETE WASTE OF MY TIME.

21:18.908 --> 21:20.610
IT'S A BIGGER WASTE
OF MY TIME,

21:20.610 --> 21:22.882
'CAUSE LISTENING TO YOU,
TIME GOES SLOWER.

21:22.882 --> 21:24.283
GOOD LUCK AT YOUR MEETING.

21:24.283 --> 21:27.517
YEAH, WELL, THANKS FOR NOTHING.
WHAT A FI-DOUCHE.

OH, LORD. I WAS HOPING
YOU'D TAKE IT FROM THERE.

22:09.058 --> 22:11.701
I HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO IDEA
WHAT TO SAY NEXT.

22:11.701 --> 22:15.004
(chuckles) UH... SORRY.
NEITHER DO I.

22:15.004 --> 22:16.566
WELL, HEY, LOOK AT THAT.

22:16.566 --> 22:17.837
WE ALREADY HAVE
SOMETHING IN COMMON.

22:17.837 --> 22:20.910
HEY. YOU USING THIS?

22:20.910 --> 22:23.913
WELL, IT LOOKS LIKE WE MIGHT
HAVE TO MAKE A COMMITMENT HERE.

22:23.913 --> 22:25.575
YOU READY TO TAKE THAT STEP?

22:27.016 --> 22:30.019
SORRY. I'M AFRAID
THIS CHAIR'S TAKEN.

22:30.019 --> 22:31.751
(glass clatters)

22:31.751 --> 22:33.082
HMM.

22:33.082 --> 22:34.954
(sighs)

22:34.954 --> 22:37.056
I'M BREE, BY THE WAY.
 BRADLEY.

22:37.056 --> 22:40.460
SO WHAT IS A MAN WEARING
A CUSTOM-MADE SUIT

22:40.460 --> 22:42.061
DOING IN A PLACE LIKE THIS?

22:42.061 --> 22:43.393
UH, WELL, ACTUALLY,
I'M NOT SUPPOSED TO BE

22:43.393 --> 22:44.834
IN A PLACE LIKE THIS.

22:44.834 --> 22:45.965
I'M SUPPOSED TO BE ACROSS TOWN
AT THE FOUR SEASONS

22:45.965 --> 22:47.997
ATTENDING
MY HIGH SCHOOL REUNION.

22:47.997 --> 22:49.839
OH, AND YOU DECIDED
NOT TO GO.

22:49.839 --> 22:52.842
NO, NO, I WENT, FOR ABOUT,
UH, SIX MINUTES.

22:52.842 --> 22:54.804
AH, ALL THESE PEOPLE
FULL OF REGRETS

22:54.804 --> 22:56.846
TRYING TO RECAPTURE
THEIR GLORY DAYS.

22:56.846 --> 22:59.749
I WAS ABOUT TO BLOW
MY BRAINS OUT.

22:59.749 --> 23:01.010
THAT SOUND CRAZY?

23:01.010 --> 23:03.112
NOT AS MUCH
AS YOU MIGHT THINK.

23:09.589 --> 23:11.060
(chuckles)

23:11.060 --> 23:14.063
I SOMETIMES THINK I MARRIED HIM
JUST TO LOSE MY VIRGINITY.

23:14.063 --> 23:15.865
(chuckles)

23:15.865 --> 23:18.898
I'VE NEVER SAID THAT
TO ANYONE.

23:18.898 --> 23:22.502
I CAN'T BELIEVE I JUST TOLD THAT
TO A TOTAL STRANGER.

23:22.502 --> 23:24.734
I DON'T KNOW WHY
EVERYONE'S SO AFRAID

23:24.734 --> 23:27.136
OF TELLING THEIR SECRETS.
IT'S FREEING, ISN'T IT?

23:27.136 --> 23:29.739
YEAH, YOU'RE RIGHT. YOU KNOW,
I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS

23:29.739 --> 23:32.482
I'VE BEEN AFRAID OF
FOR NO GOOD REASON,

23:32.482 --> 23:35.545
LIKE PIGEONS AND CILANTRO.

23:35.545 --> 23:37.817
(both laugh)

23:37.817 --> 23:42.452
WELL, I DON'T HAVE ANY PIGEONS
OR CILANTRO AT MY HOUSE.

23:42.452 --> 23:43.823
(glass clatters)

23:43.823 --> 23:46.195
YOU KNOW, I'M--I'M SORRY.

23:46.195 --> 23:48.197
I-I BET YOU'RE TOO MUCH
OF A LADY

23:48.197 --> 23:50.700
TO GO HOME WITH SOMEBODY
YOU JUST MET AT A BAR.

23:50.700 --> 23:53.102
YES, A LADY USUALLY LIKES
TO KNOW A MAN

23:53.102 --> 23:56.205
A LITTLE BIT LONGER.

23:59.939 --> 24:02.812
ALL RIGHT, THAT'S LONG ENOUGH.
LET'S GO.

24:02.812 --> 24:06.115
(laughs)

24:06.115 --> 24:08.948
(crickets chirping)

24:13.883 --> 24:15.825
(trash cans clattering)

24:15.825 --> 24:18.227
IT'S MARISA, RIGHT?

24:18.227 --> 24:21.931
UH, I'M SUSAN. I DON'T KNOW
IF YOU REMEMBER ME

24:21.931 --> 24:23.192
FROM THE OPEN HOUSE.

24:23.192 --> 24:26.065
MY MOM'S INSIDE.
I'LL GO GET HER.

24:26.065 --> 24:29.198
NO, NO, UM, ACTUALLY.
I WANTED TO TALK TO YOU ALONE,

24:29.198 --> 24:31.000
IF THAT'S OKAY.

24:31.000 --> 24:32.101
WHY?

24:32.101 --> 24:36.045
I, UH...

24:36.045 --> 24:39.048
I WANNA ASK YOU
ABOUT YOUR DAD.

24:39.048 --> 24:40.580
STEPDAD.

24:40.580 --> 24:44.053
STEPDAD. RIGHT.

24:44.053 --> 24:46.255
UM...

24:48.117 --> 24:51.721
HE WASN'T A VERY GOOD MAN,
WAS HE?

24:53.893 --> 24:56.065
WHEN YOUR MOM MENTIONED HIM,

24:56.065 --> 24:58.027
I NOTICED THE LOOK ON YOUR FACE,
AND I HAD THIS FEELING

24:58.027 --> 25:05.104
THAT... MAYBE THERE WAS
A PROBLEM... BETWEEN YOU TWO?

25:07.937 --> 25:09.078
I DON'T WANNA TALK
ABOUT THIS.

25:09.078 --> 25:11.010
IT'S OKAY.

25:11.010 --> 25:15.144
I KNOW HIM A LITTLE BIT,
ENOUGH TO KNOW...

25:15.144 --> 25:17.947
THE KIND OF PERSON HE IS.

25:20.189 --> 25:22.191
YOU CAN TELL ME.

25:24.253 --> 25:26.095
DID HE EVER HURT YOU?

25:29.559 --> 25:31.831
WHY?

25:31.831 --> 25:39.108
I KNOW THAT YOU JUST MET ME,
AND THIS MUST SEEM VERY STRANGE.

25:39.108 --> 25:42.241
BUT I CAME HERE...

25:42.241 --> 25:44.243
BECAUSE I KNOW WHAT HE DID.

25:44.243 --> 25:49.118
AND EVEN THOUGH
I CAN'T TAKE AWAY THE PAIN,

25:49.118 --> 25:53.082
I CAN PROMISE YOU ONE THING.

25:53.082 --> 25:58.688
YOUR STEPFATHER WILL NEVER
HURT YOU AGAIN.

25:58.688 --> 26:02.061
HOW CAN YOU KNOW THAT?

26:02.061 --> 26:05.134
I JUST KNOW.

26:07.597 --> 26:10.770
HE IS NEVER... COMING BACK.

26:12.602 --> 26:14.573
(whispers) I PROMISE.

26:27.586 --> 26:28.587
(laughs)

26:28.587 --> 26:30.319
OH, MY, A POOL, TOO?

26:30.319 --> 26:33.192
I WISH I'D KNOWN. I WOULD HAVE
BROUGHT MY BATHING SUIT.

26:33.192 --> 26:34.794
(chuckles)

26:34.794 --> 26:36.165
OOH!

26:36.165 --> 26:37.296
(both laugh)

26:37.296 --> 26:40.369
THIS IS WONDERFUL,
BY THE WAY.

26:40.369 --> 26:41.931
YEAH, IT WAS ONE
OF MY FAVORITES.

26:41.931 --> 26:43.372
I PICKED IT UP
ON A WINE TASTING TRIP

26:43.372 --> 26:45.204
THROUGH THE SOUTH OF FRANCE
LAST SUMMER.

26:45.204 --> 26:46.706
IT'S GOT A NICE...

26:46.706 --> 26:49.338
MMM, MMM, MMM.

26:49.338 --> 26:51.280
(chuckles)

26:51.280 --> 26:53.282
WELL, I GUESS
YOU LIKE IT, TOO.

26:53.282 --> 26:55.745
OH, MY GOODNESS. I'VE NEVER
DONE ANYTHING LIKE THAT BEFORE.

26:55.745 --> 26:58.187
WELL, HERE'S TO TRYING
NEW THINGS.

26:58.187 --> 27:00.219
(chuckles)

27:00.219 --> 27:01.991
(clink)

27:01.991 --> 27:04.393
MMM. YOU KNOW WHAT?
 HMM?

27:04.393 --> 27:08.728
I JUST THOUGHT OF SOMETHING ELSE
I'VE NEVER TRIED BEFORE.

27:10.329 --> 27:13.332
(both laughing)

27:15.334 --> 27:20.339
OH, OH. THIS IS SO CRAZY.
I'M IN A POOL. I'M NAKED.

27:20.339 --> 27:22.171
AND I LOVE IT.

27:22.171 --> 27:24.113
WELL, GET READY
TO LOVE IT EVEN MORE.

27:24.113 --> 27:26.716
OUR VERY OWN... FLOATING BAR.

27:26.716 --> 27:29.378
YOU KNOW WHAT?

27:29.378 --> 27:30.880
I JUST THOUGHT
OF SOMETHING ELSE

27:30.880 --> 27:33.252
I'VE NEVER DONE IN A POOL
BEFORE.

27:33.252 --> 27:35.154
AH.
 (chuckles)

27:37.386 --> 27:38.427
(lights clank)

27:38.427 --> 27:40.659
OH, CRAP.

27:40.659 --> 27:42.161
(gasps)

27:42.161 --> 27:43.733
DID SOMEONE JUST BREAK
INTO THE HOUSE?

27:43.733 --> 27:45.334
YEAH. ME.

27:45.334 --> 27:46.395
IS SOMEONE OUT THERE?

27:46.395 --> 27:50.139
(whispers)
WHAT'S HAPPENING?

27:50.139 --> 27:52.872
IT'S A FUNNY STORY.
HE'S MY BOSS. I'M HIS ASSISTANT.

27:52.872 --> 27:54.673
WE NEED TO GET OUT OF HERE.

27:54.673 --> 27:57.276
YOU'RE AN ASSISTANT?
AREN'T YOU OVER 40?

27:57.276 --> 27:59.879
JEEZ, YOU'RE WORSE THAN
THOSE PEOPLE AT MY REUNION!

28:02.411 --> 28:03.983
BRADLEY?

28:03.983 --> 28:06.185
MR. JACOBS,
YOU'LL BE HAPPY TO KNOW

28:06.185 --> 28:08.457
THAT I HAVE WATERED YOUR PLANTS
AND PICKED UP YOUR SUITS.

28:08.457 --> 28:10.359
OH, AND YOUR, UH,
DAUGHTER CALLED.

28:10.359 --> 28:11.891
WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU DOING?

28:11.891 --> 28:14.724
I'M SORRY. I THOUGHT YOU WEREN'T
GONNA BE BACK TILL MONDAY.

28:14.724 --> 28:17.927
OH, YOU TWO HAVE A LOT
TO TALK ABOUT.

28:17.927 --> 28:19.398
COULD I TROUBLE YOU FOR A TOWEL?

28:19.398 --> 28:20.299
SO YOU THOUGHT IN THE MEANTIME

28:20.299 --> 28:23.332
YOU COULD TAKE OVER MY HOUSE,
MY POOL,

28:23.332 --> 28:26.035
MY PANTS?!

28:26.035 --> 28:28.277
(gasps) SPEAKING OF CLOTHES,
I'D LOVE TO BE WEARING SOME

28:28.277 --> 28:29.338
FROM THAT PILE RIGHT THERE.

28:29.338 --> 28:30.409
WHO ARE YOU?

28:33.412 --> 28:34.744
(water splashes)

28:34.744 --> 28:37.216
OOH. UH, I CAN ASSURE YOU,
I NEVER DO THIS SORT OF THING.

28:37.216 --> 28:40.289
JUST GET OUT!

28:43.923 --> 28:46.495
YOU HAVE A LOVELY, LOVELY HOME.

28:46.495 --> 28:50.059
(raft creaks)

28:50.059 --> 28:52.361
(whirring in distance)

28:52.361 --> 28:54.203
WHOA, NO, WE'RE NOT DONE
WITH THAT ONE YET.

28:54.203 --> 28:55.404
DON'T KNOW WHAT TO TELL YOU.

28:55.404 --> 28:58.437
LEASE HASN'T BEEN PAID,
AND I GOT SENT TO TAKE IT BACK.

28:58.437 --> 29:00.469
GUY WITH THE FUNNY ACCENT
ASKED ME TO WAIT A HALF-HOUR

29:00.469 --> 29:03.943
WHILE HE MEETS WITH SOME,
UH, BANKERS.

29:12.521 --> 29:15.254
MIKE, HEY. PRIVATE MEETING.

29:17.486 --> 29:18.888
(latches click)

29:18.888 --> 29:21.961
YEAH, DO ME A FAVOR, BUD.
STEP BACK OUTSIDE.

29:21.961 --> 29:23.993
ARE YOU CRAZY?

29:23.993 --> 29:27.236
WELL, IT'S JUST A STOP-GAP LOAN.
NO WORRIES.

29:27.236 --> 29:29.238
WHO IS THIS GUY?
 SORRY, PAL.

29:29.238 --> 29:31.470
THE DEAL'S OFF.
HE'S NOT TAKING YOUR MONEY.

29:31.470 --> 29:33.943
IF HE'S A FRIEND,
I SUGGEST YOU URGENTLY

29:33.943 --> 29:35.504
GET THE HELL OUT OF MY FACE.

29:35.504 --> 29:38.507
MIKE, I'M NOT ASKING YOU.
I'M TELLING YOU.

29:38.507 --> 29:39.909
MIND YOUR OWN BUSINESS.

29:39.909 --> 29:42.051
BEN, WHEN YOU'RE DEAD
OR ON THE LAM

29:42.051 --> 29:44.013
BECAUSE YOU CAN'T PAY THEM BACK,
AND TRUST ME,

29:44.013 --> 29:46.415
YOU WILL NEVER BE ABLE
TO PAY THEM BACK...

29:47.957 --> 29:53.492
I'M GONNA LOSE MY JOB.
THAT IS MY BUSINESS.

29:57.296 --> 29:58.797
YOU CAN GO.

30:01.901 --> 30:04.433
(sighs)

30:04.433 --> 30:07.006
"MIKE," WAS IT?

30:07.006 --> 30:08.537
YEAH.

30:10.239 --> 30:11.480
YEAH. MIKE.

30:11.480 --> 30:13.512
(door opens)

30:13.512 --> 30:15.584
(sighs)

30:20.189 --> 30:26.555
MY WHOLE LIFE, MONEY'S BEEN
THE BOOT ON MY THROAT, YOU KNOW?

30:26.555 --> 30:30.099
WHEN I WAS A KID, WHEN I WAS
A YOUNG GUY STARTING OUT,

30:30.099 --> 30:34.503
AND EVEN NOW WHEN I'M SUPPOSEDLY
SOME SORT OF A SUCCESS.

30:34.503 --> 30:37.206
YEAH, IT'S A PAIN IN THE ASS.

30:37.206 --> 30:39.969
EVEN RENEE, AS RICH AS SHE IS,
STILL COMPLAINS ABOUT IT.

30:39.969 --> 30:42.942
YEAH, YEAH, SHE, UH,
SHE DIVORCED SOME ATHLETE

30:42.942 --> 30:44.343
OR SOMETHING, RIGHT?

30:44.343 --> 30:47.616
SOME ATHLETE?
TRY DOUG PERRY.

30:47.616 --> 30:50.019
THE NEW YORK YANKEE.

30:50.019 --> 30:51.550
OH. SORRY, MATE.

30:51.550 --> 30:53.082
IF SHE DIVORCED
A CRICKET PLAYER,

30:53.082 --> 30:54.353
I MIGHT RECOGNIZE THE NAME.

30:54.353 --> 30:56.185
(chuckles) IF SHE DIVORCED
A CRICKET PLAYER,

30:56.185 --> 30:58.557
SHE WOULDN'T HAVE GOTTEN
$12 MILLION.

30:58.557 --> 31:00.859
ANOTHER?

31:00.859 --> 31:02.491
UH... YEAH.

31:05.294 --> 31:07.636
YEAH, YEAH, ANOTHER.

31:14.203 --> 31:15.504
(British accent)
WELL, GABY, WE ARE VERY FOND

31:15.504 --> 31:17.406
OF CARLOS AND EVERYONE
AT GLOBAL, BUT HELP ME OUT HERE.

31:17.406 --> 31:19.548
HOW CAN I TELL OUR BOARD
WE'RE GOING WITH YOUR FIRM

31:19.548 --> 31:22.351
INSTEAD OF A LARGER ONE
WITH A LONGER TRACK RECORD?

31:22.351 --> 31:27.316
FOUR WORDS--"OPEN-ARCHITECTURE
INVESTMENT PLATFORM."

31:27.316 --> 31:31.020
AH. SO AS OPPOSED TO TIGHTLY
CONTROLLING OUR PORTFOLIO,

31:31.020 --> 31:34.263
YOU WOULD OPEN IT UP TO
A NUMBER OF ASSET MANAGERS.

31:34.263 --> 31:36.625
ISN'T THAT WHAT I JUST SAID?

31:36.625 --> 31:38.497
(all chuckle)

31:38.497 --> 31:40.299
(clears throat)
SO WHERE DO YOU SEE

31:40.299 --> 31:42.031
THE GREATEST OPPORTUNITY
FOR GROWTH?

31:42.031 --> 31:46.635
FIVE WORDS...

31:46.635 --> 31:49.108
DEBT MANAGEMENT
AND EMERGING MARKETS.

31:49.108 --> 31:51.180
(British accent) YES,
BECAUSE THE I.M.F. HAS VOWED

31:51.180 --> 31:52.982
TO SUPPORT THOSE ECONOMIES.

31:52.982 --> 31:54.683
WE LIKE WHAT WE'RE HEARING,
GABY.

31:54.683 --> 31:57.046
(chuckles) TWO WORDS--
ME, TOO.

31:57.046 --> 31:59.248
(all chuckle)
 (cell phone ringing)

31:59.248 --> 32:01.620
OH. SORRY.

32:01.620 --> 32:03.352
IT'S MY DAUGHTER.
(chuckles)

32:03.352 --> 32:06.395
(beep)
 (lowered voice) JUANITA,
I'M IN A BUSINESS MEETING.

32:06.395 --> 32:08.657
YES,
I HAVE BUSINESS MEETINGS.

32:08.657 --> 32:10.029
SINCE NOW.
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

32:10.029 --> 32:13.532
NO, YOU CANNOT GIVE
YOUR SISTER A HAIRCUT.

32:13.532 --> 32:15.304
OH, OKAY.
WELL, I'LL FIX IT LATER.

32:15.304 --> 32:17.266
JUST DON'T LET HER LOOK
IN ANY MIRRORS.

32:17.266 --> 32:21.010
SORRY ABOUT THAT.
WHERE WERE WE?

32:21.010 --> 32:22.941
WELL, I WAS JUST ABOUT
TO ASK YOU YOUR OPINION

32:22.941 --> 32:25.074
OF THE LONG-TERM VIABILITY
OF THE EURO.

32:25.074 --> 32:28.717
AH, WELL...

32:28.717 --> 32:30.279
WHERE'S MY MENU?

32:30.279 --> 32:32.481
THE WAITER TOOK IT.
 WHAT? WAIT.

32:32.481 --> 32:34.253
WE HAVEN'T EVEN ORDERED YET.

32:34.253 --> 32:35.724
OH, THE CHEF IS CREATING

32:35.724 --> 32:37.626
A TASTING MENU FOR US.
ISN'T THAT NICE?

32:37.626 --> 32:41.090
NO! NO, NO.
I... NEED MY MENU.

32:41.090 --> 32:43.092
(chuckles)

32:52.141 --> 32:56.345
COME ON. GOTTA BE IN HERE.

32:56.345 --> 32:58.247
RESERVATION
UNDER COMMERSON.

32:58.247 --> 33:00.179
OH. HERE.
SIT WHEREVER YOU WANT.

33:04.653 --> 33:08.617
IS THERE A PROBLEM, GABY?

33:08.617 --> 33:11.990
NO. (chuckles) UH...

33:11.990 --> 33:14.193
NO, NO. NO PROBLEM.
(chuckles)

33:14.193 --> 33:17.766
EVERYTHING IS FINE.

33:17.766 --> 33:21.100
(sighs) ENOUGH BUSINESS TALK.
LET'S JUST EAT.

33:21.100 --> 33:22.671
OH, NO, I LOVE THIS STUFF.

33:22.671 --> 33:25.204
IN FACT, I AM GOING TO
PICK YOUR BRAIN

33:25.204 --> 33:26.635
FOR THE ENTIRE MEAL.

33:26.635 --> 33:29.738
YAY! (laughs)

33:29.738 --> 33:32.041
SO YOU WERE JUST ABOUT
TO TELL US YOUR FEELINGS

33:32.041 --> 33:36.715
ABOUT THE FUTURE
OF A UNIFIED EUROPEAN CURRENCY.

33:39.488 --> 33:40.789
FIDUCIARY.

33:49.298 --> 33:50.729
HEY, HOW WAS PRACTICE?

33:50.729 --> 33:53.602
COACH IS AN IDIOT.

33:53.602 --> 33:55.464
(sighs) YOU STILL
CAN'T FIX IT?

33:55.464 --> 33:58.607
WELL, I'M SURE I COULD,
BUT YOU KNOW,

33:58.607 --> 34:00.209
I'M STARTING TO LIKE IT
THAT WAY.

34:00.209 --> 34:01.610
GIVES THE PLACE AMBIANCE.

34:01.610 --> 34:02.771
(Parker) MOM!

34:02.771 --> 34:05.744
LIKE A FLICKERING CANDLE.

34:05.744 --> 34:07.176
MOM?!

34:07.176 --> 34:09.618
CAN YOU COME UP HERE?

34:09.618 --> 34:10.819
YES, HONEY?

34:10.819 --> 34:13.051
WHAT DID YOU DO?

34:13.051 --> 34:15.324
I WAS TRYING TO FIX
THE LIGHT IN THE KITCHEN.

34:15.324 --> 34:16.824
AND NOW MY WALL HAS
A HUGE HOLE BASHED IN IT?

34:16.824 --> 34:19.828
HEY, HEY, DON'T GET ALL
HIGH AND MIGHTY.

34:19.828 --> 34:21.659
THERE ARE SEVERAL WALLS
IN THIS HOUSE

34:21.659 --> 34:23.661
THAT HAVE HUGE HOLES
BASHED IN THEM.

34:23.661 --> 34:25.393
AND YOU THOUGHT
I WOULDN'T NOTICE

34:25.393 --> 34:27.466
IF YOU... COVERED IT
WITH A UNICORN POSTER?

34:27.466 --> 34:29.697
WELL, PARKER, YOU DIDN'T NOTICE
WHEN I WAS BALD FROM CHEMO,

34:29.697 --> 34:31.370
SO, YEAH,
IT WAS WORTH A SHOT.

34:31.370 --> 34:33.772
(Penny) WHY IS THERE A MAP
OF CANADA ON MY WALL?

34:36.574 --> 34:37.806
OH, MY GOD!

34:37.806 --> 34:39.678
I DON'T WANNA SEE INTO HIS ROOM!

34:39.678 --> 34:41.679
IT'S BAD ENOUGH HEARING
WHAT GOES ON IN THERE.

34:41.679 --> 34:43.652
SHUT UP. I'M NOT THE ONE WHO
PRACTICES KISSING

34:43.652 --> 34:44.853
WITH A STUFFED DOLPHIN.

34:44.853 --> 34:46.215
HEY, HEY!

34:46.215 --> 34:49.087
MOM, WHAT HAPPENED?

34:49.087 --> 34:52.321
I WAS LOOKING FOR A THING
CALLED THE SECONDARY FUSE BOX,

34:52.321 --> 34:54.293
WHICH IS SUPPOSED TO BE
IN THE WALL,

34:54.293 --> 34:57.094
BUT IT TURNS OUT
THE INTERNET CAN BE WRONG.

34:57.094 --> 34:58.497
UNBELIEVABLE.

34:58.497 --> 35:02.271
MOM, WE TOLD YOU TWO DAYS AGO,
JUST CALL AN ELECTRICIAN.

35:05.774 --> 35:07.276
NO.

35:07.276 --> 35:09.608
NO. I HAVE TO BE ABLE
TO FIGURE THIS OUT.

35:09.608 --> 35:11.680
YOUR FATHER IS GONE,
AND LOTS OF THINGS LIKE THIS

35:11.680 --> 35:17.416
ARE GOING TO HAPPEN, AND I NEED
TO KNOW HOW TO FIX THEM.

35:17.416 --> 35:20.149
IF I HAD KNOWN HE WAS
GOING TO REALLY LEAVE,

35:20.149 --> 35:21.750
THEN I WOULD HAVE HAD HIM
TEACH ME THIS STUFF

35:21.750 --> 35:23.792
WHILE HE WAS STILL HERE!

35:30.429 --> 35:34.433
I... SHOULD GO GET DINNER
READY.

35:44.173 --> 35:46.275
I'M SORRY. I DON'T HAVE TIME
FOR YOU RIGHT NOW.

35:46.275 --> 35:47.646
I'M ON THE PHONE.

35:47.646 --> 35:49.718
I DON'T SEE A PHONE.

35:49.718 --> 35:53.482
YEAH.
IT'S JUST MY BOYFRIEND.

35:53.482 --> 35:54.783
SHH!

35:57.256 --> 35:59.188
SHE'LL CALL YOU BACK.

36:00.289 --> 36:01.730
I'M SORRY.

36:01.730 --> 36:05.764
AND NO MATTER HOW BUSY I WAS,
I SHOULD'VE MADE TIME FOR YOU.

36:05.764 --> 36:08.737
HOW MUCH DID THE WINE COST?

36:08.737 --> 36:10.399
$115.

36:10.399 --> 36:12.801
OKAY, YOU'RE SORRY.

36:14.743 --> 36:17.206
I GOTTA BE HONEST.

36:17.206 --> 36:19.878
I WAS WORRIED YOU WERE
LOSING INTEREST IN ME.

36:19.878 --> 36:23.412
LOSE INTEREST IN YOU?

36:23.412 --> 36:25.414
RENEE...

36:26.855 --> 36:30.959
YOU GOT EVERYTHING
A MAN COULD WANT.

36:30.959 --> 36:32.461
MMM.

36:43.502 --> 36:45.234
I'M BUSY.

36:45.234 --> 36:46.735
TOO BUSY FOR BOURBON?

36:46.735 --> 36:48.307
OR ICE CREAM?

36:48.307 --> 36:51.310
HEY, WE CAN MAKE
A BOURBON FLOAT.

36:53.211 --> 36:57.686
OKAY. TERRIBLE IDEA. I JUST
CAME TO SAY YOU WERE RIGHT.

36:57.686 --> 37:00.919
I AM A PAIN-IN-THE-ASS
KNOW-IT-ALL, AND I AM SORRY.

37:02.821 --> 37:06.495
YOU WERE RIGHT, TOO.

37:06.495 --> 37:09.658
BOURBON FLOAT'S
A TERRIBLE IDEA.

37:09.658 --> 37:11.800
BUT AN AMARETTO FLOAT...

37:16.405 --> 37:19.368
IT'S JUST SO TYPICAL.
YOU CAME TO ME FOR HELP,

37:19.368 --> 37:20.869
BUT INSTEAD,
I GAVE YOU A LECTURE,

37:20.869 --> 37:22.671
AND WHEN YOU WOULDN'T
DO WHAT I SAID,

37:22.671 --> 37:24.242
I KICKED YOU OUT.
 IT'S OKAY.

37:24.242 --> 37:25.574
NO, IT'S NOT.

37:25.574 --> 37:28.877
I HAVE BEEN DOING THIS
TO TOM FOREVER...

37:28.877 --> 37:31.520
TILL HE GOT FED UP
AND LEFT.

37:31.520 --> 37:33.852
I REALLY DON'T WANT THAT
TO HAPPEN WITH MY FRIENDS, TOO.

37:33.852 --> 37:36.755
HONEY, I DESERVED IT.
YOU'RE RIGHT.

37:36.755 --> 37:38.026
I DO FAKE MY WAY
THROUGH LIFE

37:38.026 --> 37:40.529
BY BATTING MY EYES
AND LOOKING PRETTY.

37:40.529 --> 37:42.591
AND THE PROBLEM IS,
I CAN'T DO THAT ANYMORE.

37:42.591 --> 37:45.564
RIGHT.
BECAUSE YOU'RE GETTING OLDER.

37:45.564 --> 37:47.396
NO, 'CAUSE CARLOS IS GONE.

37:47.396 --> 37:49.668
OH, SORRY.

37:49.668 --> 37:51.700
I JUST HAVE ALL
THESE RESPONSIBILITIES.

37:51.700 --> 37:53.402
I HAVE TO GROW UP.

37:53.402 --> 37:54.843
WELL, HE SHOULD BE BACK
IN A FEW WEEKS.

37:54.843 --> 37:57.946
WHAT IF HE ISN'T? WHAT IF HE
CAN'T KICK THIS THING?

37:57.946 --> 38:00.679
THEN I'M GONNA BE ON MY OWN,
AND I AM HELPLESS ON MY OWN.

38:00.679 --> 38:02.611
AND THAT'S WHY
I CAME TO YOU.

38:02.611 --> 38:04.282
I JUST WANTED SOMEONE
TO TAKE CARE OF THINGS

38:04.282 --> 38:06.515
SO I WOULDN'T HAVE TO.

38:06.515 --> 38:09.558
I WANTED YOU TO BE MY CARLOS.

38:09.558 --> 38:10.989
AW.

38:14.823 --> 38:17.466
(voice breaking)
I JUST MISS HIM SO MUCH.

38:17.466 --> 38:21.930
I MISS TOM, TOO.

38:21.930 --> 38:23.832
BUT AT LEAST
WE HAVE EACH OTHER.

38:25.334 --> 38:26.935
WE'RE GONNA GET THROUGH THIS.

38:26.935 --> 38:28.377
HOW DO YOU KNOW?

38:28.377 --> 38:30.379
BECAUSE...

38:30.379 --> 38:31.940
I KNOW EVERYTHING, REMEMBER?

38:40.889 --> 38:43.622
(faucet running)

38:43.622 --> 38:44.923
HEY.

38:44.923 --> 38:46.555
YOU LOOK EXHAUSTED.

38:46.555 --> 38:49.628
I AM. I WAS GONNA SLEEP
ON THE PLANE, BUT--

38:49.628 --> 38:50.599
BUT THEY HAD A MOVIE
ABOUT A PARROT

38:50.599 --> 38:52.561
THAT COACHES
AN INNER CITY DEBATE TEAM?

38:52.561 --> 38:53.862
(both laugh)

38:53.862 --> 38:55.534
HEY, I HAVEN'T
HEARD THAT IN A WHILE.

38:55.534 --> 38:57.636
AW.
 IT'S NICE.

38:57.636 --> 39:01.640
OH, THIS TRIP, MIKE--
IT DID WHAT I NEEDED IT TO DO.

39:01.640 --> 39:02.711
OH, I'M GLAD.

39:02.711 --> 39:04.012
YEAH.

39:04.012 --> 39:09.578
I THINK THIS WHOLE ALEJANDRO
NIGHTMARE IS FINALLY OVER.

39:09.578 --> 39:12.781
(kisses)
 MM.

39:12.781 --> 39:14.583
PLEASE DON'T CANCEL THE CARD.
MY HUSBAND'S BEEN OUT OF TOWN,

39:14.583 --> 39:15.954
BUT I HAVE SOME MONEY NOW,

39:15.954 --> 39:19.458
AND I CAN MAKE
THE MINIMUM PAYMENT TOMORROW.

39:22.631 --> 39:24.032
THANK YOU.

39:25.394 --> 39:26.435
(beep)

39:26.435 --> 39:28.096
MARRY A RICH MAN, MARISA,

39:28.096 --> 39:29.698
BECAUSE THE ONLY THING
GUARANTEED IN LIFE

39:29.698 --> 39:32.040
IS THAT THE BILLS
WILL NEVER STOP.

39:32.040 --> 39:34.773
MAYBE YOU SHOULD SELL
HIS MOTORCYCLE.

39:34.773 --> 39:36.645
YOUR STEPFATHER LOVES
THAT THING. HE'D KILL ME.

39:36.645 --> 39:40.609
BUT... WHAT IF HE NEVER
COMES BACK?

39:40.609 --> 39:43.852
OF COURSE HE'S COMING BACK.
WHY WOULD YOU EVEN SAY THAT?

39:48.617 --> 39:50.859
DID HE CONTACT YOU?

39:50.859 --> 39:51.990
NO.

39:51.990 --> 39:53.161
THEN WHAT?

39:53.161 --> 39:55.624
TELL ME.

39:57.626 --> 40:00.729
THAT WOMAN WHO BOUGHT
ALL THAT STUFF...

40:00.729 --> 40:02.671
SHE CAME TO TALK TO ME.

40:04.402 --> 40:07.576
IT WAS WEIRD, BUT SHE PROMISED
HE'D NEVER COME BACK.

40:07.576 --> 40:09.578
HOW WOULD SHE KNOW?

40:09.578 --> 40:13.181
THAT'S WHAT SHE SAID.

40:13.181 --> 40:15.444
AND SHE SEEMED
PRETTY SURE ABOUT IT.

40:33.532 --> 40:37.035
TURNS OUT THE CAR
WAS HIS BOSS', TOO.

40:37.035 --> 40:39.207
I HAD TO WALK A MILE AND A HALF
TO THE BUS STOP.

40:39.207 --> 40:41.810
HAVE YOU EVER TAKEN A BUS
AT 1:00 IN THE MORNING, RENEE?

40:41.810 --> 40:43.842
IT MAKES YOU
STOP BELIEVING IN GOD.

40:43.842 --> 40:46.074
OKAY, BREE, I GET IT.

40:46.074 --> 40:47.946
AND DID I MENTION
THAT I WAS SOAKING WET?

40:47.946 --> 40:49.718
THREE TIMES.

40:49.718 --> 40:50.919
GOOD, BECAUSE I WANNA BE
VERY CLEAR

40:50.919 --> 40:53.852
JUST HOW YOUR ADVICE
WORKED OUT.

40:53.852 --> 40:56.985
CAN I SAY SOMETHING?

40:58.456 --> 41:01.490
I... THINK YOU HAD A BLAST.

41:01.490 --> 41:03.862
WHY WOULD YOU SAY THAT?

41:03.862 --> 41:05.864
I CAN SEE IT IN YOUR EYES.

41:05.864 --> 41:08.196
YOU'RE TELLING ME
ABOUT THIS HORRIBLE STORY,

41:08.196 --> 41:10.739
BUT YOU LOVE TELLING IT.

41:10.739 --> 41:14.743
THAT IS... RIDICULOUS.

41:18.476 --> 41:22.651
ALTHOUGH...
I SUPPOSE IT WAS...

41:22.651 --> 41:24.653
A LITTLE EXHILARATING.

41:24.653 --> 41:28.116
YES, GOOD FRIENDS ARE THE ONES

41:28.116 --> 41:31.219
WHO TELL US THE TRUTH
ABOUT OURSELVES.

41:31.219 --> 41:36.625
LOOK AT YOU.
YOU'RE A BAD, BAD GIRL.

41:36.625 --> 41:38.797
EVEN WHEN THE TRUTH
MIGHT BE SOMETHING

41:38.797 --> 41:41.800
WE'RE RELUCTANT TO ADMIT...

41:43.602 --> 41:47.806
THAT WE STILL HAVE
A GREAT DEAL TO LEARN...

41:50.508 --> 41:54.683
THAT WE SOMETIMES NEED TO ASK
FOR HELP...

41:57.145 --> 42:02.821
THAT WE MAY BE OVERLOOKING
A GOLDEN OPPORTUNITY.

42:05.924 --> 42:09.127
YES, HEARING THE TRUTH

42:09.127 --> 42:12.801
CAN OFTEN
SET US ON A DIFFERENT PATH.

42:14.532 --> 42:17.766
HEY THERE.
CAN I BUY YOU ANOTHER DRINK?

42:17.766 --> 42:19.768
BUT WE NEVER KNOW...

42:19.768 --> 42:21.840
YOU CAN BUY ME BREAKFAST.

42:21.840 --> 42:25.814
WHERE THAT PATH
MIGHT TAKE US...

42:28.046 --> 42:32.821
OR WHO MIGHT BE WATCHING.
