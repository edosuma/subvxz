Whoa, whoa, whoa! Are you in any danger?
More importantly, am I in any danger?

And most importantly,
can I get a cupcake, please?

What an amazing chance
to audition for the show.

01:12.906 --> 01:14.991
I thought the same thing.
We're totally on the same page.

01:15.075 --> 01:17.535
-We could sing a duet!
-Not totally the same page.

01:18.119 --> 01:20.288
I was thinking I would audition alone.

01:20.663 --> 01:23.958
But we said if we ever got the chance,
we'd audition for Future Superstars

01:24.042 --> 01:25.335
and win the golden mic together.

Besides, Sum,
singing isn't exactly your best skill.

01:36.012 --> 01:37.806
Aren't you worried
about embarrassing yourself?

01:38.264 --> 01:41.476
When have I ever embarrassed myself?

01:42.894 --> 01:44.187
Are a lot of people staring?

01:44.312 --> 01:47.690
Yeah, but that guy isn't.
Oh, never mind. He is now.

01:49.901 --> 01:52.070
Think anyone will notice
I have poison ivy?

01:52.320 --> 01:53.696
You can barely see it.

01:56.157 --> 01:57.659
Wait. Is poison ivy contagious?

01:59.619 --> 02:01.955
Yep, it's contagious.

02:03.331 --> 02:07.418
Oh, yeah! What? What?
Take it down!

02:07.710 --> 02:09.129
Oh, what?

02:10.046 --> 02:12.132
Yeah, look at this. What?

02:18.388 --> 02:22.433
You don't have to worry.
I've been secretly taking voice lessons.

I have to be honest with you, Sum.
It's not great.

02:44.247 --> 02:45.999

for my Future Superstars audition.
What do you think?

But we always said we'd sing
"Drag Me Down" together.

That's what makes it so perfect.
I'd be singing it for the both of us.

What's going on here?

04:44.951 --> 04:46.869
Mr. Finn, it's like my heart is breaking.

04:46.953 --> 04:49.622
Actually,
I was talking about the ice cream cone.

04:50.373 --> 04:52.875
But you go ahead with your story.

04:53.459 --> 04:56.004
My voice isn't good enough
for Future Superstars.

04:56.713 --> 04:59.674
I hate that show.
It's like the death of music.

04:59.841 --> 05:02.468
It's been my dream to be on it since
I was a little girl.

I mean, the death of music
in a super good way.

05:07.181 --> 05:09.892
So, what is that, like,
dark chocolate dipped in almonds?

05:10.852 --> 05:12.770
Would you like my ice cream cone,
Mr. Finn?

05:12.854 --> 05:14.439
If it would make you feel better.

05:15.565 --> 05:17.358
Look, if it's your dream to audition

05:17.442 --> 05:19.777
for a terrible show like Future
Superstars,

05:19.944 --> 05:23.531
don't let anyone tell you that
stupid dream can't come horribly true.

05:24.282 --> 05:27.577
I'm not exactly sure why,
but that made me feel better.

05:27.744 --> 05:30.121
A lot of famous singers
don't have great voices:

05:30.288 --> 05:32.874
Bob Dylan, Joey Ramone, Kanye.

05:33.374 --> 05:35.418
Listen.
I'm still involved in your problem.

05:35.668 --> 05:37.670
But I need to take a bite
of this ice cream cone.

05:38.880 --> 05:41.090
Mmm, mmm.

05:41.716 --> 05:45.595

oh, brain freeze!

05:45.928 --> 05:48.598
[groaning]

05:48.681 --> 05:53.770
But I don't want to sing if I sing badly.
I want to sing as well as Tomika does.

05:53.853 --> 05:56.522
Oh, good, it's over.

06:00.068 --> 06:04.030
Brain freeze again! When will I learn?

06:04.489 --> 06:06.365

06:06.908 --> 06:10.328
Okay, well, if you want your voice
to sound as good as Tomika's,

06:10.703 --> 06:13.790
maybe I can hypnotize you
into being a great singer.

06:13.873 --> 06:14.957
What?

06:15.083 --> 06:19.003
I downloaded this hypnotism app last week.
It's a total game-changer.

06:20.588 --> 06:22.715
Hope you boys are excited
for my big speech

06:22.799 --> 06:24.467
on the dangers of social media.

06:24.842 --> 06:26.427
-You bet.
-Sure thing, Coach Webber.

06:27.929 --> 06:29.138
How does it work, Mr. Finn?

06:29.222 --> 06:33.559
It's very technical. You hold up this
swirly majiggy doodad like this,

06:33.935 --> 06:37.188
have the person stare at it
and then say a trigger word.

06:37.522 --> 06:41.192
For example, when I say "Apricot",
you'll be a chicken.

06:41.275 --> 06:42.360
Apricot.

06:42.443 --> 06:47.323
[clucking]

06:47.406 --> 06:49.826
And then you say the trigger word again
to stop it.

06:50.118 --> 06:51.911
So, just say "Apricot"?

06:54.831 --> 06:57.375
Well, I guess it won't hurt to try
to hypnotize me.

06:57.625 --> 07:00.920
It's pretty amazing app.
But it does come with a warning.

07:01.129 --> 07:02.130
What's that?

07:02.255 --> 07:04.924
I don't know. I never read those things.
I just click "Agree".

07:05.925 --> 07:07.093
Did you guys see that?

07:07.385 --> 07:10.680
Yeah, Principal Mullins got turned
into a chicken.

07:11.389 --> 07:12.640
Do you know what this means?

07:12.723 --> 07:17.103
Yes, we find an adult immediately
and explain the situation.

07:23.443 --> 07:25.945
Okay, Mr. Finn,
I'm ready to be hypnotized.

07:26.028 --> 07:28.072
And hypnotized, you shall be.

07:28.448 --> 07:31.242
Hold on, got to wait for the ad
to stop playing.

07:32.243 --> 07:33.494
You don't need car insurance, do you?

07:33.828 --> 07:36.080
-No.
-Yeah, I don't have it either.

07:37.623 --> 07:43.296
Okay, stare directly at the swirls
on the screen.

07:43.504 --> 07:45.923
-I read that some people are hard to hyp--
-And sleep.

07:50.470 --> 07:55.391
Summer, I'll pick a word that
no one ever uses: "Persimmon".

07:55.683 --> 07:59.437
When I say "Persimmon",
you will become a great singer.

07:59.770 --> 08:04.192
Every note will be perfect.
And you'll buy me a doughnut every day.

08:05.276 --> 08:10.615
I really like bear claws.
Oh, a good fritter: mmm.

08:11.532 --> 08:16.370
Wait. Where was I?
Oh, right, you're a great singer.

08:16.954 --> 08:18.956
And wake up.

08:20.583 --> 08:24.045
Wow, Mr. Finn, did you do it?
Do you think it worked?

08:24.712 --> 08:26.130
Maybe, start signing.

08:26.339 --> 08:30.259
Okay, but first, I have this really
strong urge to buy you a doughnut.

08:32.887 --> 08:33.930
It may have worked!

08:35.765 --> 08:36.849
Is that him?

08:36.974 --> 08:39.101
Yeah, that's Danny Gill.

08:39.435 --> 08:40.770
I hate that guy.

08:41.354 --> 08:44.232
He always drinks from the water fountain
and spits it on the person behind him.

08:44.357 --> 08:46.067
Yeah, it's really gross,

08:46.400 --> 08:50.196
except on super hot days.
Then it's humiliating, but refreshing.

08:51.614 --> 08:55.117
Today, when he goes to take a sip,
he'll get a face full of justice.

08:56.369 --> 08:57.578
Quick, Danny Gill is coming!

09:01.999 --> 09:04.126
Oh, pardon me, Danny Gill.

09:04.210 --> 09:05.253
Oh, no.

Whoa, what do you mean, "We"?

12:24.410 --> 12:26.328
You know,
you won't sound like a wounded moose.

12:26.412 --> 12:27.663
And people won't laugh at us.

12:27.746 --> 12:30.916
"Us"? We won't be embarrassed? Oh, I see.

12:31.000 --> 12:32.084
So, this never was about me.

12:32.543 --> 12:35.087
-Uhh, well--
-This was about you being embarrassed.

12:35.171 --> 12:37.006
You were trying to protect yourself.

12:37.131 --> 12:40.509
Okay, fine, I was. But you have
to admit you embarrass me a lot.

12:40.593 --> 12:41.594
How?

12:41.677 --> 12:44.138
Well, this fight in front of everybody,
for one.

12:47.641 --> 12:50.352
Look,
a duet on Future Superstars that got us

12:50.436 --> 12:52.855
on the dud clips would haunt us forever.

12:53.022 --> 12:54.648
I was trying to protect both of us.

12:54.982 --> 12:58.944
Well, you don't have to worry about me
anymore because I'm auditioning solo.

13:00.196 --> 13:04.283
Fine, I'll rely on my talent.
You rely on your crystal ball.

13:04.492 --> 13:08.954
It's not some dumb crystal ball.
It's a mysterious swirl.

13:10.623 --> 13:13.501
You're just mad that it worked
and made me a better singer than you.

13:13.918 --> 13:15.920
"Better singer"? In your dreams.

13:16.128 --> 13:18.506
You know what,
I'm not going to stand here and take this.

13:19.089 --> 13:21.884
Umm, no, if anyone's leaving, I am.

13:26.555 --> 13:27.848
I know I'm not a real teacher.

13:27.932 --> 13:31.101
But you can't just leave in the middle
of class, right?

13:36.690 --> 13:39.235
This is everything
of yours from my locker.

13:39.401 --> 13:41.779
If you find anything else of mine,
you have my address.

13:43.072 --> 13:45.115
Or you can give it
to me tomorrow at carpool.

13:48.577 --> 13:51.247
Oh, the golden mic we made together,

13:51.705 --> 13:53.374
I don't want this anymore: here.

13:53.707 --> 13:56.544
I don't need it.
I'm getting the real one soon.

13:57.211 --> 14:01.173
Fine, then we'll toss it,
this symbol of our friendship, garbage.

14:01.423 --> 14:02.633
-Fine!
-Fine!

14:06.053 --> 14:07.137
That feels good.

14:07.471 --> 14:10.182
Yeah, what a relief.

14:15.062 --> 14:17.231
Now that we have control
over Principal Mullins,

14:17.398 --> 14:19.441
we have to be careful not
to take advantage of it.

14:19.775 --> 14:20.901
Totally agree.

14:26.740 --> 14:30.452
Best idea ever!

14:32.496 --> 14:34.415
Get out the way! Hey, ladies.

Ooh!

14:45.050 --> 14:46.635
Vive la France.

14:47.428 --> 14:49.305
Sorry, Clark. Are you okay?

14:50.097 --> 14:51.891
No, I'm not okay.

14:52.099 --> 14:54.852
You nearly ruined
my birdseed Eiffel Tower.

14:55.144 --> 14:56.145
We're so sorry.

14:56.270 --> 14:58.439
Oh, you're going to be sorry.

14:58.981 --> 15:01.859
Here comes Principal Mullins.
When she hears what you've done,

Yes, of course.
It's my secret shame. No offence.

to walk behind the security line.
