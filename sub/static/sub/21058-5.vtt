WEBVTT

00:18.935 --> 00:21.020
...will be presented in the following
days at this entity.

00:21.104 --> 00:22.939
It is being reported that a strategic
plan will be presented to...

00:23.022 --> 00:24.524
TONALÁ
OUTSIDE GUADALAJARA

00:24.607 --> 00:26.860
...an official comunique
informing that the search continues

00:26.943 --> 00:28.820
at a national level for Joaquin
"El Chapo" Guzman

00:28.945 --> 00:31.698
for the death of
Cardinal Juan Jesus Posadas Ocampo.

00:31.781 --> 00:34.951
Military and police forces
have been dispatched...

00:38.038 --> 00:39.748
Did you get through?

00:39.831 --> 00:43.084
-Everything's in place, boss.
-Hello, boss.

00:43.168 --> 00:45.670
Let's get the money
and leave for El Salvador.

00:55.180 --> 00:56.181
Put it here.

00:58.349 --> 01:00.101
Hey, hand me the blade.

01:27.212 --> 01:28.797
They're no good, boss!

01:29.631 --> 01:30.924
Fuck!

02:05.333 --> 02:09.671
I feel the warmth
from my boiling blood

02:09.754 --> 02:14.008
I feel the fear,
sweat dripping away

02:14.092 --> 02:18.346
There's a stillness
that nothing transmits

02:18.429 --> 02:23.893
I'm a breeze that
grows stronger

02:25.520 --> 02:29.399
Even when the clouds drift away

02:29.482 --> 02:33.444
Even when my skin dries away

02:33.528 --> 02:37.532
I'll be back someday

02:38.533 --> 02:42.579
To unleash my return

02:46.583 --> 02:51.212
I have the dust that
protects the road

02:51.296 --> 02:55.592
I have the branches
of a leafless tree

02:55.675 --> 03:00.013
I'm the guardian of the tired night

03:00.096 --> 03:05.768
There are silhouettes
that come to meet me

03:06.769 --> 03:10.356
Even when the clouds drift away

03:11.149 --> 03:14.402
Even when my skin dries away

03:15.236 --> 03:19.407
I'll be back someday

03:19.490 --> 03:24.370
To unleash my return

03:27.206 --> 03:30.960
Two, four, six, eight, ten.

03:34.839 --> 03:37.300
This isn't even enough
to leave Mexico.

03:39.344 --> 03:41.304
Put everything in the bag, Toño.

04:11.125 --> 04:13.503
-Thanks, boss.
-Thanks, boss.

04:13.586 --> 04:14.963
Let's go.

04:26.057 --> 04:27.225
Boss.

04:28.393 --> 04:31.312
Why did you pay them
if we're short on money?

04:32.397 --> 04:34.983
My head's worth five million, Toño.

04:35.066 --> 04:39.737
We'll have to spend a lot of money
to make sure people don't betray us.

04:55.503 --> 04:57.755
We combed the entire city.

04:57.839 --> 05:01.050
-We couldn't find him anywhere.
-Are his people being watched?

05:01.134 --> 05:03.052
We're all over Ismael and Güero, boss.

05:03.136 --> 05:04.929
So far, so good.

05:06.389 --> 05:10.018
Well, he's not an idiot.
He knows we'll have him followed.

05:11.019 --> 05:13.855
We made it known
you're looking for information.

05:14.939 --> 05:18.568
If he talks to someone
or shows his face, we'll know.

05:19.319 --> 05:23.948
MEXICO CITY
MEXICO

05:36.335 --> 05:37.503
Fill her up.

06:02.236 --> 06:03.738
What time do you have?

06:07.366 --> 06:09.660
-3:10.
-Thanks.

06:21.756 --> 06:23.132
Just keep it.

06:30.807 --> 06:32.809
Get out of here slowly.
Foot off the gas.

07:04.173 --> 07:07.426
-Two rooms, please.
-Names?

07:07.510 --> 07:09.303
Jorge Ramos Pérez
and Carlos Tijero.

07:09.387 --> 07:12.807
...Chapo Guzmán.

07:12.890 --> 07:16.394
This is confirmed
by the evidence we have,

07:16.477 --> 07:19.230
evidence supported
by proof obtained...

07:19.313 --> 07:21.441
Here are the keys.

07:23.359 --> 07:26.779
I need to use a phone to get cash
and close our deals in El Salvador.

07:26.863 --> 07:29.282
I'll take care of it
first thing tomorrow.

07:29.365 --> 07:32.326
Just don't call your family.

07:32.410 --> 07:34.537
Don't call Güero or Don Ismael.

07:36.372 --> 07:38.458
Amado's working
with the government.

07:38.541 --> 07:41.961
They're probably being watched
and their phones tapped.

08:24.086 --> 08:26.881
UNITED STATES

08:36.390 --> 08:37.683
Don't worry, Min.

08:37.767 --> 08:39.310
We have our people on every block.

08:39.393 --> 08:41.312
Come on, son. Go, go, go.

08:41.395 --> 08:43.606
How long do you think?

08:43.689 --> 08:45.983
Will we stay here?

08:46.067 --> 08:48.236
Until things quiet down.

08:51.364 --> 08:54.534
I don't trust those fucks.

08:54.617 --> 08:58.454
They're going after Chapo now,
but then they'll come after us.

08:59.622 --> 09:03.668
They owe us,
and I'm gonna make them pay.

09:03.751 --> 09:06.420
El Chapo, Ismael...

09:07.505 --> 09:08.589
and Amado.

09:09.757 --> 09:12.760
We'll get revenge
on Ismael and Amado later, Ramón.

09:12.843 --> 09:15.263
Don't even worry about Chapo.

09:15.346 --> 09:19.392
No matter where he's hiding,
there's nowhere he can run to.

09:25.815 --> 09:27.733
Where's your boss?

09:31.988 --> 09:33.823
He's not here.

09:36.450 --> 09:41.372
What you're seeing is a tour
through several safe houses

09:41.455 --> 09:44.083
which belong to
Joaquín "Chapo" Guzmán.

09:44.166 --> 09:47.962
Guzmán is still on the run,
but, according to General Blanco,

09:48.045 --> 09:50.256
not for long.

09:50.339 --> 09:53.217
-General...
-The only thing I can say

09:53.301 --> 09:55.177
is the operation is in progress.

09:55.261 --> 09:59.473
He's surrounded.
He'll be captured in a few hours.

09:59.557 --> 10:02.560
If we find anything else,
we'll notify you.

10:02.643 --> 10:03.936
Thank you.

10:07.064 --> 10:09.233
Thank you, everyone.

10:09.317 --> 10:12.069
Excuse me. Excuse me. Thank you.

10:30.379 --> 10:32.840
COAST OF EL SALVADOR

10:36.427 --> 10:40.097
Are you sure
you can continue the party?

10:40.181 --> 10:44.101
Hell yeah. The plan's still on.

10:44.185 --> 10:46.896
Just make sure the girl
makes it to El Salvador.

10:46.979 --> 10:49.565
She's having the time of her life.

10:49.649 --> 10:52.068
The other four girls
are on their way.

10:52.151 --> 10:56.072
Drop them off at the same place.
Tell everyone not to move them.

10:56.155 --> 10:59.241
I'll pick them up myself.

10:59.325 --> 11:01.410
Yes, sir.

11:24.517 --> 11:26.060
Hello?

11:26.143 --> 11:29.188
It's me. I need your help.

11:30.272 --> 11:31.732
I'm listening.

11:31.816 --> 11:34.652
I don't want to hear excuses.

11:36.570 --> 11:38.781
Double the checkpoints if necessary.

11:39.949 --> 11:42.576
Don't call me
until you've caught El Chapo.

11:43.828 --> 11:45.788
Fucking idiots.

11:46.956 --> 11:50.084
I'll be back tomorrow
after the cardinal's funeral.

11:50.167 --> 11:52.670
Call me immediately
if anything happens.

11:52.753 --> 11:54.422
Of course, General.

12:11.981 --> 12:13.315
-Good afternoon.
-Hello.

12:13.399 --> 12:15.985
I'm looking for a case
published in La Nota Roja

12:16.068 --> 12:17.736
from about ten years ago.

12:19.780 --> 12:21.615
Fill this out, please.

12:39.133 --> 12:41.760
-I'll be right back.
-Thank you.

14:31.203 --> 14:35.165
Gentlemen, in four days, I'll have your
passports and other documents.

14:35.249 --> 14:36.750
No.

14:39.920 --> 14:41.630
Need them sooner.

14:41.714 --> 14:43.799
Without documents,
I can't leave this place.

14:46.302 --> 14:48.929
I'll try to have them ready
for the day after tomorrow.

14:50.514 --> 14:51.932
Don't fail me, Lora.

15:02.318 --> 15:04.612
Well, would you look at that.

15:04.695 --> 15:05.863
What's up?

15:06.989 --> 15:08.157
What's in there?

15:53.661 --> 15:55.496
Any news?

16:32.241 --> 16:33.534
LIEUTENANT COLONEL BLANCO'S
BODYGUARD ACCUSED OF RAPE

16:36.453 --> 16:38.747
I'd like a copy of this file.

16:38.831 --> 16:40.374
Here's the code.

16:40.457 --> 16:43.085
I'd like to see
the next two weeks, too,

16:43.168 --> 16:44.670
but just El Global, please.

16:44.753 --> 16:45.921
One moment, please.

16:56.515 --> 17:00.269
LIEUTENANT COLONEL BLANCO'S
BODYGUARD MURDERED BEFORE TRIAL

17:01.770 --> 17:03.313
MURDER SHOCKS THE COMMUNITY

17:27.296 --> 17:28.630
Gabriela Saavedra?

17:36.680 --> 17:37.973
Who murdered him?

17:41.060 --> 17:43.395
That was a long time ago.

17:46.440 --> 17:48.025
Why do you want to know?

17:49.818 --> 17:51.653
General Blanco is my new boss.

17:52.905 --> 17:57.701
It didn't take me long to realize
the kind of man he really is.

17:57.785 --> 17:59.453
An asshole.

18:02.206 --> 18:04.374
I can't tell you much.

18:05.375 --> 18:07.211
But, to be honest...

18:08.128 --> 18:10.756
nothing would make me happier
than to see him fall.

18:13.926 --> 18:16.470
Officially, they never
found the murderer.

18:17.554 --> 18:20.516
But you believe the general is guilty.

18:23.227 --> 18:27.481
It's not that hard
to put two and two together.

18:27.564 --> 18:29.274
Why are you so sure?

18:30.234 --> 18:33.153
Nice on the outside,
a monster on the inside.

18:33.237 --> 18:36.156
That's what we journalists
used to say about him.

18:37.366 --> 18:40.410
The bodyguard
was his scapegoat.

18:41.411 --> 18:43.705
Blanco was...

18:44.706 --> 18:46.250
the rapist.

18:49.002 --> 18:51.964
Why didn't you report it publicly?

18:53.632 --> 18:54.967
Did he threaten you?

18:55.050 --> 18:56.051
No.

18:56.885 --> 18:59.263
No, he was a lieutenant
at that time,

18:59.346 --> 19:01.849
but I knew he was protected.

19:01.932 --> 19:05.894
I could never access the files
from the attorney general's office.

19:05.978 --> 19:09.022
Without that, there's no article.

19:10.732 --> 19:13.110
And if I give you access
to that information?

19:14.528 --> 19:16.655
It'd be the article of your career.

19:18.490 --> 19:20.492
Would you publish it?

19:22.661 --> 19:25.873
If you're man enough
to face the general...

19:27.249 --> 19:29.251
I'll end that fucker.

20:16.340 --> 20:17.591
Hello?

20:33.482 --> 20:35.234
Take care, son.

21:01.426 --> 21:03.637
GUADALAJARA
WASTE SERVICES

21:25.617 --> 21:27.577
Do it!

23:13.850 --> 23:16.269
OFFICE OF THE
ATTORNEY GENERAL OF MEXICO

23:31.326 --> 23:33.328
Long time no see.

23:33.411 --> 23:36.414
-A pleasure. How are you, Alberto?
-Good, still here.

23:36.498 --> 23:39.126
-How's life?
-Everything's good.

23:40.252 --> 23:42.587
Without an official authorization,
it's very difficult

23:42.671 --> 23:44.631
to access that information.

23:44.714 --> 23:47.300
Conrado, I'd be risking my job.

23:47.384 --> 23:51.179
Look, I can't get
an official authorization.

23:51.263 --> 23:52.973
It'll take too long.

23:55.058 --> 23:57.561
But I can get you some money

23:57.644 --> 24:00.188
to take your family
on vacation.

24:01.439 --> 24:03.441
Have your girls been to Orlando?

24:08.155 --> 24:10.532
They're not kids anymore, Alberto.

24:10.615 --> 24:13.160
If you don't take them now,
when will you?

24:14.953 --> 24:17.581
You just have to open the door for me.

24:34.431 --> 24:35.432
Hey.

24:35.515 --> 24:37.809
I've got your present.

24:37.893 --> 24:39.728
We're leaving tonight.

24:41.354 --> 24:44.524
I'm going to kiss you
five million times when I see you.

24:44.608 --> 24:46.735
Your kisses are my salvation.

24:48.153 --> 24:49.946
Let me know
when you get here.

25:28.944 --> 25:32.489
In aisle 20 you'll find
everything related to sexual abuse.

25:32.572 --> 25:34.741
Please, put everything back
in its place.

25:34.824 --> 25:36.660
Remember you've got six hours.

25:37.702 --> 25:39.037
No problem.

28:10.605 --> 28:12.690
This is as far as I go.

28:14.651 --> 28:16.611
They told me to give you this.

28:20.615 --> 28:23.660
It's not a long way
to the capital. Come on.

28:33.086 --> 28:34.462
Let's go, then.

28:56.943 --> 28:59.112
-Don Ernesto.
-How are you?

30:00.507 --> 30:02.175
-Morning.
-Good morning.

30:02.967 --> 30:05.345
-License and ID.
-Okay.

30:13.269 --> 30:15.230
-You're from Guadalajara?
-Yes.

30:15.313 --> 30:18.441
-What are you doing out here?
-I live in DF.

30:18.525 --> 30:20.527
I went to Toluca for some meats.

30:24.572 --> 30:25.865
Go on.

30:25.949 --> 30:27.242
Thanks.

30:44.467 --> 30:46.719
I need you to go to Guatemala

30:46.803 --> 30:49.180
and make sure
everything's ready for my arrival.

30:49.264 --> 30:51.182
Bribe whoever you have to

30:51.266 --> 30:54.227
so I'll be safe
and can cross to El Salvador.

31:02.527 --> 31:05.363
Find Rosado.
He's the heavy hitter there.

31:07.574 --> 31:08.950
Tell him I need protection.

31:09.868 --> 31:10.869
Hello?

31:10.952 --> 31:12.245
As you wish, boss.

31:12.328 --> 31:14.205
Boss.

31:16.583 --> 31:18.710
-Hello?
-Your present's here.

31:18.793 --> 31:20.295
Safe and sound.

31:20.378 --> 31:22.005
I'm on my way.

32:01.336 --> 32:03.588
-What do I do?
-Stop the car.

32:04.881 --> 32:06.799
Let's try something different.

32:16.643 --> 32:19.771
Good afternoon. License, please.

32:28.279 --> 32:31.449
Your truck has no plates.
Where's your permit?

32:35.078 --> 32:37.664
I'll have to give you a ticket
and confiscate your truck.

32:37.747 --> 32:39.040
Officer.

32:41.084 --> 32:43.628
Let's settle this unofficially.

32:44.629 --> 32:46.589
How much are we talking about?

32:49.342 --> 32:51.636
$10,000, and take me to your boss.

32:53.513 --> 32:55.181
Someone willing to do business.

32:56.474 --> 32:58.935
-You got it on you?
-Yes.

33:03.231 --> 33:04.315
Wait here.

33:08.361 --> 33:09.779
I hope this works, boss.

33:09.862 --> 33:12.281
It's our last option, Toño.

33:13.908 --> 33:15.159
Central.

33:15.243 --> 33:17.787
-We can leave now.
-No.

33:17.870 --> 33:20.456
The entire city is looking for us.

33:20.540 --> 33:22.583
We need help to leave.

33:22.667 --> 33:24.002
Got it.

33:33.094 --> 33:36.514
-Hands up! Get them up!
-What'd your boss say?

33:37.515 --> 33:38.808
Give me the bag!

33:40.518 --> 33:42.186
Quick.

33:46.024 --> 33:48.609
Out. Hands in the air.

33:55.450 --> 33:57.410
Hurry, asshole. Come on.

33:58.745 --> 34:01.497
Come on, asshole. Hurry up.

34:31.444 --> 34:33.488
Here they are, boss.

34:33.571 --> 34:35.656
Carlos Tijero and Jorge Ramos.

34:41.370 --> 34:43.915
What do you want?
Why did you ask to see me?

34:43.998 --> 34:45.958
I want to offer you a deal.

34:46.042 --> 34:47.460
I'm not Jorge Ramos.

34:48.961 --> 34:51.255
I'm Chapo Guzmán.

35:08.773 --> 35:11.234
You're a smart man, director.

35:11.317 --> 35:13.319
We can make a deal.

35:13.402 --> 35:16.864
Your head's more valuable
than any deal, Chapo.

35:16.948 --> 35:19.408
-My freedom.
-Not this time.

35:19.492 --> 35:20.535
Let's go.

35:34.841 --> 35:37.802
If you hand me in,
they'll give you one million dollars.

35:37.885 --> 35:39.011
I'll give you two.

35:39.929 --> 35:42.557
That will be enough
for you and your family.

35:42.640 --> 35:45.810
Your money won't make me famous.
Your capture will.

35:46.853 --> 35:49.939
Who captured
Caro Quintero and Mr. Neto?

35:50.022 --> 35:53.776
You know those cops
never got the credit.

35:53.860 --> 35:55.653
It will be the same for you.

35:58.114 --> 36:00.199
And you know General Blanco.

36:01.242 --> 36:03.786
Do you think
he'll let you take the credit?

36:05.204 --> 36:09.208
He'll make some operation up
in which he was the hero.

36:09.292 --> 36:12.211
And you?
No one will know your name.

36:13.254 --> 36:16.132
You'll regret rejecting my offer.

36:16.215 --> 36:19.010
Two million, director.

36:19.093 --> 36:22.597
Let my buddy get you the money,
and you'll be rich in no time.

36:23.681 --> 36:25.516
Money buys power.

36:26.809 --> 36:29.061
If you hand me in, I lose.

36:29.145 --> 36:30.521
But so do you.

36:30.605 --> 36:33.608
The general will be the only winner.

36:49.790 --> 36:50.875
It's me.

36:56.631 --> 36:58.799
-Where's the money?
-In the car.

36:59.675 --> 37:00.885
Where's Joaquín?

37:14.315 --> 37:17.026
-How much?
-Two million.

37:45.680 --> 37:46.681
Commander.

37:58.609 --> 38:01.487
I knew you were a business man.

38:01.570 --> 38:05.116
-If you ever need anything, call us.
-I do need something.

38:05.199 --> 38:06.575
I'm all ears.

38:08.869 --> 38:10.496
I need to leave the city.

38:27.680 --> 38:29.223
You saved my ass.

38:31.309 --> 38:33.936
-Come with me to Guatemala.
-Really?

38:34.020 --> 38:35.229
Yes.

38:37.356 --> 38:39.650
I'll go anywhere with you, Joaquín.

39:06.218 --> 39:08.471
-Hello?
-Toño.

39:08.554 --> 39:10.514
Tell Joaquín
everything's ready.

39:10.598 --> 39:11.640
GUATEMALA CITY
GUATEMALA

39:13.267 --> 39:15.770
He can come to Guatemala.

39:17.772 --> 39:20.358
LIEUTENANT ROSADO
HEAD OF GUATEMALA ARMY

39:28.616 --> 39:31.952
INDUSTRIAL AREA/SAN JORGE
NEIGHBORHOOD, EL SALVADOR

39:37.625 --> 39:39.126
Ah, Güero.

39:40.461 --> 39:42.713
You have the entire shipment.

39:45.841 --> 39:46.884
Remember.

39:46.967 --> 39:50.388
Don't move it until Chapo gets here.

40:04.360 --> 40:07.613
How much is your boss paying
for information?

40:17.206 --> 40:19.667
-Yeah?
-Boss.

40:20.501 --> 40:23.587
Five tons just arrived
in El Salvador for El Chapo.

40:23.671 --> 40:25.798
They're saying he's the one
picking up the load.

40:48.612 --> 40:50.406
Tell him we're ready.

41:10.426 --> 41:12.887
I can help you leave the city
and nothing else.

41:12.970 --> 41:16.515
-Then you're on your own.
-That's more than enough.

42:55.698 --> 42:57.074
Amado told me

42:57.157 --> 43:00.578
Chapo's trying to cross Guatemala
to get to El Salvador.

43:12.965 --> 43:14.008
Lucía.

43:14.091 --> 43:16.552
Call the Guatemalan president.

43:16.635 --> 43:18.345
Yes, sir, contacting him.

43:22.850 --> 43:24.727
We got this asshole.

43:31.692 --> 43:33.027
Mr. President...

43:34.153 --> 43:38.699
I need your help to stop
a very dangerous criminal.

43:41.660 --> 43:43.370
He is going to El Salvador.

43:43.454 --> 43:45.623
He's trying to leave Mexico
through the Guatemalan border.

43:55.591 --> 43:56.592
