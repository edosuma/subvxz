WEBVTT

00:23.155 --> 00:24.992
Angie?

00:25.091 --> 00:26.459
Open the door.

00:27.326 --> 00:30.463
Angie, please, please, please, please.

02:43.096 --> 02:44.731
How are we-

02:46.165 --> 02:47.901
This
band is single-handedly

02:48.001 --> 02:49.503
saving the music industry.

02:49.603 --> 02:53.674
I can't believe we'll finally
see the face behind the music.

02:53.774 --> 02:57.243
I know I'll be tuning into the
live stream tomorrow morning

02:57.343 --> 02:58.679
for the unmasking.

02:58.779 --> 02:59.946
You keep requesting it.

03:00.047 --> 03:02.448
So here it is, the new single from SIN5.

03:02.549 --> 03:05.251
- Fuck yeah.
- ...is Luna.

03:31.310 --> 03:33.013
What the fuck are you doing?

03:33.113 --> 03:34.648
This isn't part of the plan.

03:35.882 --> 03:37.117
I know.

03:37.216 --> 03:38.752
We talked about this.

03:38.852 --> 03:42.723
If they don't see it, they're
gonna think something else.

03:42.823 --> 03:43.924
The papers are signed.

03:46.325 --> 03:47.627
I'm sorry.

03:47.728 --> 03:48.628
Fuck.

03:51.330 --> 03:53.100
Did you tell anybody else?

03:53.200 --> 03:55.702
No.

03:55.802 --> 03:58.572
From now on, it's better
you don't know anything.

04:00.372 --> 04:01.842
Be ready when I need you.

04:02.876 --> 04:03.777
Of course.

04:07.881 --> 04:08.849
Where's the club?

04:10.316 --> 04:11.918
It's called the Hidden Gem.

04:12.819 --> 04:13.720
It's intimate.

04:15.287 --> 04:16.857
You wanna see some pictures?

04:18.125 --> 04:19.226
No, it's okay.

04:19.325 --> 04:20.426
I trust you.

04:26.733 --> 04:27.634
Are we good?

04:31.772 --> 04:32.672
No.

04:39.411 --> 04:41.380
The guests are starting to arrive.

04:48.021 --> 04:50.056
Are you sure about this?

04:56.897 --> 04:58.799
Can I get you a drink?

04:59.933 --> 05:00.834
No.

05:56.355 --> 05:57.858
What's up bro?

05:59.125 --> 06:00.193
GB.

06:00.293 --> 06:01.561
What do you do, GB?

06:03.462 --> 06:05.799
I'm a ski instructor.

06:07.100 --> 06:08.668
I own ski resorts.

06:10.170 --> 06:11.071
You're Windham?

06:13.039 --> 06:16.243
You can find him up
those steps right there.

06:16.343 --> 06:17.409
Thank you.

06:17.510 --> 06:18.612
No problem.

06:31.490 --> 06:33.593
You must be GB.

06:37.864 --> 06:40.700
I appreciate a man who
gets things done, sit down.

06:42.869 --> 06:43.770
You party?

06:58.084 --> 06:58.985
Good?

07:01.721 --> 07:02.622
Good.

07:08.460 --> 07:09.963
That was easy.

07:11.831 --> 07:12.599
Enjoy.

07:12.699 --> 07:14.433
You heard of suggestives?

07:16.870 --> 07:17.771
Yeah.

07:18.738 --> 07:19.940
What do you know?

07:22.642 --> 07:27.247
It's skip all the main
base, for mind control.

07:28.181 --> 07:31.251
It targets the pineal gland
in the back of the brain

07:31.351 --> 07:35.121
where the soul is supposedly located.

07:36.790 --> 07:39.960
Can you get some tonight?

07:43.697 --> 07:46.433
They're super expensive
and even harder to find.

07:46.533 --> 07:48.101
Yeah.

07:48.201 --> 07:49.536
I know.

07:49.636 --> 07:51.871
I got a party downstairs and
I got some thirsty people.

07:51.972 --> 07:56.576
If you can get some tonight,
I'll pay you double the rate.

07:58.845 --> 07:59.478
Double?

07:59.579 --> 08:01.114
I don't like to repeat myself.

08:04.351 --> 08:06.152
I will let you know if I do.

08:08.688 --> 08:09.923
I'll be here.

08:16.563 --> 08:18.098
Have a nice night, GB.

08:36.649 --> 08:37.751
Perfect.

09:08.081 --> 09:10.483
The numbers speak for themselves.

09:10.583 --> 09:12.218
The Chinese have pre-ordered.

09:12.318 --> 09:15.321
We've got action figures,
dolls, clothing, jewelry.

09:15.422 --> 09:17.724
We've got everything from shoelaces

09:17.824 --> 09:19.893
to mouse pads and bubblegum.

09:22.028 --> 09:22.929
Goodbye kitty.

09:23.763 --> 09:25.698
We're gonna be bigger than Coke.

09:27.901 --> 09:28.536
Cola.

09:32.472 --> 09:33.606
Have a drink.

10:37.003 --> 10:38.004
Hi.

10:38.104 --> 10:39.005
Hi.

10:39.906 --> 10:43.109
I like your Docs, they
remind me of ninth grade.

10:44.010 --> 10:46.012
I've had them since ninth grade.

10:48.114 --> 10:49.082
You look cool.

10:49.949 --> 10:53.920
You look like you could
be in a Tim Curry movie,

10:54.020 --> 10:56.322
or like a Sandman comic book.

10:56.422 --> 10:58.691
You seem comfortable in the dark.

11:00.660 --> 11:02.795
I like being mysterious.

11:04.964 --> 11:07.033
You down with the money moguls,

11:07.133 --> 11:08.735
or are you with the underground?

11:08.835 --> 11:10.403
Come out so I can see you.

11:15.875 --> 11:18.711
I like being in the shadows.

11:32.792 --> 11:33.960
What's your name?

11:36.996 --> 11:38.331
GB.

11:38.431 --> 11:39.332
GB?

11:40.500 --> 11:41.401
GG.

11:43.369 --> 11:44.672
Okay.

11:44.771 --> 11:45.872
I'll play along.

11:57.884 --> 11:58.985
Now what?

12:01.387 --> 12:02.455
Well it's

12:04.824 --> 12:06.694
a party going on.

12:06.793 --> 12:08.228
This place sucks.

12:11.130 --> 12:13.366
Would you be open to go on a quest?

12:15.201 --> 12:16.302
It depends.

12:20.641 --> 12:23.176
Have you ever heard of suggestives?

12:23.276 --> 12:24.310
What's that?

12:24.410 --> 12:28.848
Well, If you take the best
components of every drug

12:28.948 --> 12:31.851
and you roll it into
one, that's what you get.

12:31.951 --> 12:34.921
You can suggest anything within yourself

12:35.822 --> 12:38.925
to another person, or even together,

12:39.025 --> 12:40.527
and it will fucking happen.

12:52.305 --> 12:55.375
Information is faster than
we know what to do with it.

12:56.776 --> 12:59.379
Nothing should be that accessible.

13:00.280 --> 13:03.550
Nothing brews anymore,
especially in the arts.

13:03.651 --> 13:05.451
There's no passion.

13:06.520 --> 13:08.121
No identity.

13:12.392 --> 13:13.527
No identity,

13:15.663 --> 13:16.829
until now.

13:18.931 --> 13:20.800
But that's why you're all here.

13:21.502 --> 13:24.103
Without any further ado,

13:24.971 --> 13:25.872
ladies and gentlemen,

13:25.972 --> 13:30.143
I give you the lead singer of SIN5,

13:37.050 --> 13:39.352
The lead singer of SIN5.

13:46.694 --> 13:47.594
Excuse me.

14:19.760 --> 14:21.928
I'm just on the other side.

14:22.028 --> 14:23.664
What a cool bridge.

14:24.430 --> 14:26.899
It's called Shakespeare Bridge.

14:26.999 --> 14:28.000
Is that an indication

14:28.101 --> 14:30.103
of what's gonna unfold tonight?

14:31.270 --> 14:33.906
What does that even mean?

14:42.348 --> 14:43.517
I like this.

14:44.183 --> 14:45.985
Please get down from there.

14:49.623 --> 14:50.657
Seriously.

14:50.758 --> 14:51.658
Okay.

15:20.219 --> 15:21.954
What shall we do?

15:33.099 --> 15:35.067
Did you leave your date behind?

15:36.169 --> 15:38.171
No, he's more like my brother,

15:38.271 --> 15:40.173
just wants to know where I'm at.

15:41.040 --> 15:43.376
Oh, he's probably just
looking out for you then.

15:44.010 --> 15:46.212
Oh, the Hollywood sign.

15:46.312 --> 15:48.080
Oh, your first time in LA?

15:48.715 --> 15:50.383
How long have you lived here?

15:51.150 --> 15:52.385
I grew up here.

15:52.485 --> 15:53.986
How do you like it?

15:55.556 --> 15:56.489
You can be honest.

15:59.626 --> 16:03.196
A lot of show and tell,
so many people come and go.

16:04.130 --> 16:05.998
And I can only imagine how many dreams

16:06.098 --> 16:08.167
get crushed here every day.

16:08.267 --> 16:10.303
Yeah, I know what you mean.

16:11.505 --> 16:15.007
Well, like, you know, like the
first time you come out here,

16:15.107 --> 16:18.277
you know, you don't know anybody.

16:20.714 --> 16:22.783
It's like, you don't know
what you can eat next,

16:22.883 --> 16:24.183
you don't know where you're gonna sleep,

16:24.283 --> 16:27.220
so you better be good at
whatever it is that you're doing.

16:27.320 --> 16:29.088
Like take musicians, for example,

16:29.857 --> 16:33.594
like the early stuff is usually
better than the later stuff,

16:33.694 --> 16:34.628
because then they got some money

16:34.728 --> 16:37.196
and got driven around
in limos all day long.

16:37.898 --> 16:39.365
Got too comfortable, you know?

16:39.465 --> 16:41.735
That's why there's so
many one hit wonders.

16:41.835 --> 16:42.936
Yeah, exactly.

16:43.035 --> 16:45.639
That's why I wanted to stay hungry.

16:46.907 --> 16:48.775
So what were you doing at the party?

16:51.110 --> 16:52.779
You don't know what the party was for?

16:52.880 --> 16:53.780
No.

16:54.615 --> 16:55.949
You don't know?

16:56.048 --> 16:57.149
No.

16:59.118 --> 17:01.254
It was the unveiling of SIN5.

17:01.354 --> 17:02.255
What?

17:03.189 --> 17:06.157
Holy fuck, oh my God I fucking love SIN5

17:06.259 --> 17:07.594
What do they look like?

17:10.463 --> 17:12.833
I don't know, they
there were in and out.

17:12.933 --> 17:14.667
I really like their name, too.

17:16.335 --> 17:17.538
I wonder if it means-

17:17.637 --> 17:18.539
- Left.

17:20.406 --> 17:22.876
Last number five after seven.

17:22.976 --> 17:24.076
Yeah.

17:25.979 --> 17:27.781
What's your favorite song by them?

17:27.881 --> 17:29.081
There's too many.

17:30.517 --> 17:31.518
It's not Luna?

17:31.618 --> 17:32.519
Luna's up there,

17:32.619 --> 17:36.055
but that's like for
only certain occasions.

17:37.456 --> 17:40.827
I imagine the song was
written for nights like this,

17:42.161 --> 17:43.830
special occasions.

18:41.220 --> 18:43.023
302 in the red.

18:43.122 --> 18:44.223
Double Jack.

18:44.891 --> 18:46.192
What's a 302?

18:47.259 --> 18:49.161
It's two 151's.

18:50.764 --> 18:51.798
For hardcore people.

19:09.082 --> 19:12.151
You didn't even want to bring me.

19:12.251 --> 19:13.854
I was just feeling you out.

19:16.590 --> 19:19.158
I thought it was gonna
be an Illuminati party.

19:19.258 --> 19:21.795
I wish, I'm not that cool.

19:22.963 --> 19:24.263
Let's talk about you.

19:25.632 --> 19:29.770
Let's not, let's just lie to each othe

19:29.870 --> 19:31.404
What do you want to lie about?

19:31.505 --> 19:33.406
Anything inconsequential.

19:34.841 --> 19:36.143
That could be anything.

19:36.242 --> 19:37.343
Exactly.

19:38.344 --> 19:39.646
What's your porn name?

19:40.781 --> 19:42.115
Yeah, I know that one.

19:42.214 --> 19:43.950
Name of first pet and sweet.

19:45.251 --> 19:47.486
It's Sparkle Babcock.

19:51.357 --> 19:53.026
PP Interceptor.

19:54.427 --> 19:56.997
See? Who cares about names,

19:57.097 --> 19:58.632
as long as we're having fun.

20:01.935 --> 20:02.836
Cool.

20:09.241 --> 20:12.278
What's the craziest
thing you've ever done.

20:15.247 --> 20:18.250
Peyote, with shamans.

20:18.350 --> 20:20.319
Did you find your spirit animal?

20:21.521 --> 20:22.421
No,

20:25.092 --> 20:26.993
I saw my dead grandfather.

20:31.698 --> 20:33.734
Do you really want to hear this?

20:33.834 --> 20:34.735
Yeah.

20:40.974 --> 20:42.509
I woke up during the wake.

20:43.342 --> 20:44.611
He's sleeping right next to me.

20:44.711 --> 20:47.147
And meanwhile, his casket
is supposed to be outside,

20:47.246 --> 20:49.315
and his body's supposed to be in it.

20:50.416 --> 20:53.687
I mean, I've tripped hard before,

20:53.787 --> 20:56.523
but once I took some acid that
was fucking double dipped,

20:56.623 --> 20:59.059
and dickhead forgot to tell me that.

20:59.159 --> 21:00.927
We went to the park,

21:01.027 --> 21:02.529
and I was so fucking high.

21:02.629 --> 21:07.667
Like literally like the world
like turned upside down,

21:07.801 --> 21:10.170
and I'm holding onto the
grass with my fingertips.

21:10.269 --> 21:12.706
So I wouldn't fall down
into the fucking sky.

21:14.841 --> 21:16.676
What I'm saying is that,

21:18.211 --> 21:20.781
I know when I'm high and when I'm not.

21:21.915 --> 21:23.550
This time, it was real.

21:23.650 --> 21:27.053
He showed himself to say goodbye.

21:32.526 --> 21:33.860
Do you even believe me?

21:34.961 --> 21:36.630
Yeah, absolutely.

21:39.833 --> 21:40.734
Thanks.

21:42.002 --> 21:42.903
You?

21:46.640 --> 21:48.942
Out of body experience.

21:49.042 --> 21:49.943
Do tell.

21:51.645 --> 21:54.047
I was hanging out with these hippies,

21:54.147 --> 21:56.315
doing shrooms in the forest,

21:57.751 --> 21:58.484
a lot.

21:58.585 --> 22:02.388
And I was sitting on this stump,

22:02.488 --> 22:04.624
waiting for it to hit me basically.

22:06.092 --> 22:07.426
And everyone said,

22:07.527 --> 22:09.830
I was just sitting there very
catatonic and not talking,

22:09.930 --> 22:12.966
and they thought it was
fine, so they just all left.

22:13.066 --> 22:15.502
And the next thing I know,

22:15.602 --> 22:18.271
I am looking down from above the trees,

22:18.370 --> 22:20.774
and everyone's running around naked,

22:20.874 --> 22:23.677
and I was floating
anywhere I wanted to go.

22:25.444 --> 22:29.115
And then I started to move

22:29.216 --> 22:32.285
into this really dark space.

22:32.986 --> 22:36.790
And I knew that if I
continued, it would mean death.

22:38.058 --> 22:39.092
So I turned around.

22:41.294 --> 22:45.599
And that's why I believe in
souls or energy consciousness.

22:45.699 --> 22:47.701
- And I'm not afraid of-
- Dying.

22:49.202 --> 22:50.103
Living.

22:53.640 --> 22:55.809
Shall we inquire of our seekings.

23:07.254 --> 23:08.288
By any chance, do you know

23:08.387 --> 23:11.490
where we can get some suggestives?

23:19.299 --> 23:20.399
No.

23:26.940 --> 23:28.341
No.

23:38.985 --> 23:39.886
Anything?

23:40.654 --> 23:42.055
Everybody has some hearsay story,

23:42.155 --> 23:44.124
but nobody knows anything.

23:44.224 --> 23:45.125
Same here.

23:49.596 --> 23:51.564
I love this scene.

23:52.999 --> 23:58.038
Me too.

24:00.273 --> 24:02.542
I mean, why can't this be the norm?

24:04.177 --> 24:07.479
Why does plain and boring
have to be the judges?

24:07.580 --> 24:08.982
Because if you reverse it,

24:09.082 --> 24:11.685
then the plain and
boring would be the cool.

24:13.653 --> 24:14.754
Yeah, I guess.

24:16.990 --> 24:19.893
Have you ever been to Wave-Gothic-Treffe

24:19.993 --> 24:21.161
What's that?

24:21.261 --> 24:25.966
My God, it's a music
festival in Leipzig, Germany,

24:26.066 --> 24:29.102
and the whole town turns goth for a week

24:29.202 --> 24:31.237
And you see these goth families

24:31.338 --> 24:33.873
with the cutest little goth babies.

24:38.178 --> 24:39.579
It'll never be the norm.

24:40.747 --> 24:42.949
Let them judge all they want.

24:52.692 --> 24:55.795
So you want to have a goth baby?

25:00.333 --> 25:01.201
What does a goth baby look like?

25:01.301 --> 25:02.602
Does he have like baby death hawk

25:02.702 --> 25:05.805
with like little burnsy wurnsies?

25:08.708 --> 25:10.877
We should have tried.

25:15.548 --> 25:16.716
She's pretty.

25:18.018 --> 25:18.985
Look at her.

25:19.085 --> 25:23.590
She's all free of an
inhibition, in the moment,

25:24.357 --> 25:26.126
right here, right now.

25:27.260 --> 25:28.161
Go up there.

25:29.095 --> 25:29.996
I dare you.

25:31.631 --> 25:32.499
I mean what have you got to lose?

25:32.599 --> 25:34.100
Just pretend nobody's here.

25:35.702 --> 25:36.836
I dare you.

25:40.140 --> 25:41.041
All right.

25:44.744 --> 25:46.346
If I go up there,

25:46.446 --> 25:48.314
you have to do whatever I dare.

25:49.182 --> 25:50.083
No.

25:51.084 --> 25:51.985
Too late.

26:58.519 --> 27:00.854
That was so impressive.

27:00.954 --> 27:03.389
I think you deserve a 604.

27:03.490 --> 27:05.125
Can I get a hug instead?

27:17.303 --> 27:20.273
I hear those leave a
cinnamon taste on your lips.

27:27.113 --> 27:28.148
Yo!

27:29.682 --> 27:33.052
Are guys looking for some suggestives?

27:34.454 --> 27:37.023
What? Are you interested or not?

27:38.658 --> 27:40.426
Come on, let's go talk somewhere quiet

27:51.905 --> 27:53.306
Step into my office.

28:03.149 --> 28:04.050
So.

28:06.419 --> 28:08.221
You guys try it yet?

28:08.321 --> 28:09.189
No.

28:10.690 --> 28:14.060
Dude, my last client,
this fat fuck of a dude,

28:14.727 --> 28:16.396
he takes some, drops to the ground

28:16.496 --> 28:19.533
and this motherfucking
slob starts doing pushups

28:19.633 --> 28:22.168
on two fucking fingers, man,

28:22.268 --> 28:25.539
over and over until three of
the hottest girls in the club

28:25.639 --> 28:26.439
went home with him.

28:26.540 --> 28:27.807
Let's talk biz.

28:28.741 --> 28:29.842
All right.

28:30.476 --> 28:31.811
Four ounce bottle's 10 Gs.

28:31.911 --> 28:34.615
If you're serious, we can make it happen

28:34.714 --> 28:35.949
10 Gs?

28:37.483 --> 28:38.718
10 Gs?

28:38.818 --> 28:40.554
I got a lot of people here
that want to see me, so-

28:40.654 --> 28:41.754
- We'll take it.

28:46.627 --> 28:48.261
You know it's cash only?

28:48.361 --> 28:49.530
I know.

28:49.630 --> 28:52.031
What are you doing with that much cash

28:52.131 --> 28:53.833
For emergency drug deals.

28:56.269 --> 28:58.738
It's fine, you don't have to pay me back

28:59.640 --> 29:00.807
Who are you?

29:03.677 --> 29:04.777
We got half.

29:07.213 --> 29:08.114
All right.

29:15.855 --> 29:18.291
I guess you'll get the rest at pickup.

29:19.092 --> 29:21.662
Okay, I'm cool with that.

29:21.761 --> 29:24.030
Message me, but do it soon.

29:24.732 --> 29:26.466
Fucking busy bro.

29:26.567 --> 29:27.834
Catch you guys later.

29:36.610 --> 29:37.511
So,

29:39.513 --> 29:43.216
where to now?

29:43.316 --> 29:44.217
The manor.

29:45.785 --> 29:46.886
Okay.

30:09.942 --> 30:11.377
What is this place?

30:15.683 --> 30:19.485
It's a therapy group that
I go to, trade for trade.

30:19.586 --> 30:21.454
I give 'em meds, they give me money.

30:44.844 --> 30:45.779
Hey GB.

30:45.878 --> 30:46.780
Hey.

30:46.879 --> 30:47.781
How you doing man?

30:47.880 --> 30:49.315
Okay, the wine is here.

30:50.983 --> 30:53.587
Hey, how are you buddy?

30:55.488 --> 30:56.523
All right!

31:09.235 --> 31:12.305
Yeah man, I jack off all day long, man

31:12.405 --> 31:14.307
You know, to hentai.

31:15.676 --> 31:17.578
Cartoons only fucking get me hard now.

31:17.678 --> 31:19.646
You know, it's fucking evil.

31:19.747 --> 31:21.914
I just remember he kept saying,

31:25.418 --> 31:29.255
I love you, I love you, I
just remember him saying that.

31:29.355 --> 31:32.626
And I thought to myself, Jesus,
this man really loves me.

31:34.728 --> 31:37.930
My head was bleeding

31:38.030 --> 31:40.266
and there was blood all over.

31:41.501 --> 31:42.902
He broke my arm.

31:45.773 --> 31:50.243
To be perfectly honest with all of you,

31:50.343 --> 31:51.444
I felt,

31:59.620 --> 32:00.721
I believed him.

32:00.821 --> 32:03.624
I thought, if this is love,

32:04.858 --> 32:06.225
then I'm gonna take it.

32:08.294 --> 32:11.431
I promised myself I
wouldn't do it again.

32:16.436 --> 32:20.541
I'd been alone for years
and I was happy, 'cause

32:23.644 --> 32:25.344
I couldn't be hurt that way.

32:27.681 --> 32:28.582
And,

32:31.417 --> 32:32.318
and then

32:35.288 --> 32:39.560
I went to the department store
I used to go to growing up.

32:40.627 --> 32:41.695
And I saw her.

32:47.266 --> 32:50.604
It was like love at first sight.

32:50.704 --> 32:52.606
Thank you.

32:52.706 --> 32:56.142
And thank you, Yuki,
Chastity, for sharing.

32:59.713 --> 33:01.380
Addiction is a motherfucker.

33:03.115 --> 33:04.217
You know?

33:05.451 --> 33:10.624
But here we are, we're all in
a safe environment, you know,

33:14.360 --> 33:17.564
GB, GG, would you like to share?

33:21.635 --> 33:23.169
I am not there.

33:24.738 --> 33:26.105
You don't want to go?

33:31.477 --> 33:35.147
Yeah, I mean like those
cheeks and that little nose,

33:35.248 --> 33:37.383
it was just like, when you squeeze it.

33:40.486 --> 33:41.622
GG?

33:41.722 --> 33:42.488
Yeah?

33:42.589 --> 33:43.957
We really got to go.

33:44.056 --> 33:45.592
No, let's stay.

33:45.692 --> 33:46.760
I'm having so much fun.

33:46.860 --> 33:49.095
Look at his tongue, it's so cute.

33:53.901 --> 33:55.903
Listen GG, we really have to go, pleas

33:56.003 --> 33:56.904
Hey dude, what the fuck?

33:57.004 --> 33:59.706
Get the fuck off of my brother.

34:15.656 --> 34:16.556
What?

34:20.059 --> 34:21.159
Hey.

34:22.629 --> 34:24.330
Hey, come on, wait.

34:25.899 --> 34:26.800
Wait.

34:27.935 --> 34:28.702
Come on.

34:28.802 --> 34:30.904
Stop acting funny.

34:31.004 --> 34:33.005
I want some drugs man.

34:33.105 --> 34:34.473
I want some drugs.

34:40.146 --> 34:41.246
Keys?

34:42.683 --> 34:45.150
Everyone in there was bearing their soul

34:45.251 --> 34:46.085
Why wouldn't you?

34:46.185 --> 34:47.721
Those are my friends inside.

34:48.789 --> 34:51.456
They're the ones recovering,
and you're gonna act like that?

34:51.558 --> 34:54.027
Hey, I just want you to
be with me in the moment.

34:54.126 --> 34:55.460
Well you got it.

34:57.229 --> 34:58.565
Come on.

34:58.665 --> 34:59.933
I kissed a furry.

35:00.634 --> 35:03.269
I mean you were kung fu fighting him.

35:07.741 --> 35:08.709
I'm with you.

35:11.143 --> 35:12.244
Okay?

35:13.013 --> 35:14.548
What are you doing to me?

35:16.917 --> 35:17.818
Okay.

35:19.151 --> 35:21.120
I just reacted, okay?

35:21.220 --> 35:24.558
You were so jealous
and you were so cute.

35:28.829 --> 35:29.863
We're still short.

35:31.832 --> 35:33.332
So what are we gonna do?

35:38.304 --> 35:41.875
Fuck, I can't believe I got to do this

36:05.398 --> 36:07.366
Who the hell put up these lights?

36:08.434 --> 36:10.436
Your mom has that much cash.

36:11.104 --> 36:13.607
Yeah, she's a bit of a prepper.

36:13.707 --> 36:16.275
You know she got all
brainwashed from my dad.

36:18.712 --> 36:23.517
Fuck, I don't know if I want to do this.

36:24.183 --> 36:26.252
What are you gonna tell her?

36:26.352 --> 36:27.453
I don't know.

36:34.360 --> 36:36.730
I'm really sorry if I
woke you up tonight, mom.

36:36.830 --> 36:37.731
No problem.

36:38.532 --> 36:39.833
I can use the company.

36:41.367 --> 36:42.536
So what is it?

36:43.170 --> 36:44.171
What do you need the money for?

36:44.270 --> 36:45.138
I can double up my money

36:45.237 --> 36:46.606
by investing in something tonight.

36:46.707 --> 36:47.941
No you can't.

36:48.041 --> 36:49.576
Are you talking about drugs?

36:51.978 --> 36:52.746
Yes.

36:52.846 --> 36:53.580
No.

36:53.680 --> 36:54.881
Had you finished your studies

36:54.981 --> 36:57.117
you'd be in a big
pharmaceutical company by now.

36:57.216 --> 36:58.384
That's spilled milk talk, mom,

36:58.484 --> 36:59.986
you know I hate spilled milk talk.

37:00.087 --> 37:02.956
If I give you the money,
will you go back to school?

37:03.056 --> 37:03.957
Mom?

37:04.925 --> 37:06.126
I put in a lot for this house.

37:06.225 --> 37:08.028
Yeah, with drug money.

37:08.128 --> 37:10.396
So what? I earned it.

37:12.465 --> 37:14.868
This must look really weird to you.

37:16.302 --> 37:17.403
Yeah.

37:18.105 --> 37:20.841
I can tell when a person is lying.

37:20.941 --> 37:23.242
So I just stopped lying.

37:26.412 --> 37:27.848
We want to get married.

37:31.118 --> 37:32.018
Go on.

37:33.520 --> 37:36.123
He was there for me at the right time,

37:36.223 --> 37:37.624
at the right moment.

37:38.925 --> 37:41.628
I've been traveling the
world the past year.

37:43.597 --> 37:46.432
Jumped out of planes, swam with sharks.

37:48.267 --> 37:49.803
Ultimately I'm alone.

37:52.072 --> 37:54.007
It's been a long time.

37:57.443 --> 37:59.012
He makes me feel.

38:03.884 --> 38:05.451
He makes me feel.

38:15.128 --> 38:16.428
Okay.

38:17.329 --> 38:19.566
I'll give you the money.

38:34.815 --> 38:35.715
Hello?

38:38.151 --> 38:40.287
No, no, no, don't worry about it.

38:40.386 --> 38:41.922
No, it's okay.

38:45.625 --> 38:47.426
No, I'll call you right back.

38:51.231 --> 38:52.398
Here you go.

38:52.498 --> 38:53.733
Count it to be sure.

38:54.901 --> 38:55.802
Where's GG?

38:56.468 --> 38:58.171
She's on the phone outside.

38:58.271 --> 39:00.472
You come over less and less.

39:00.574 --> 39:01.775
I don't see you enough.

39:01.875 --> 39:04.511
You know I don't like
seeing you like this.

39:04.611 --> 39:06.345
It's God's will.

39:08.048 --> 39:09.049
He has a plan.

39:10.283 --> 39:11.952
It's not God's will mom.

39:13.720 --> 39:15.188
You can have the fucking operation.

39:15.288 --> 39:16.388
You so goddamn stubborn.

39:16.488 --> 39:18.525
It's so fucking superstitious.

39:18.625 --> 39:21.460
Missus Smith had the same eye operatio

39:23.063 --> 39:24.564
She died soon after that.

39:24.664 --> 39:26.833
Don't you want to be
able to see me again?

39:26.933 --> 39:30.136
Or anybody, don't you
want to be able to see GG?

39:30.237 --> 39:32.371
I can still see you.

39:32.471 --> 39:33.807
I really can.

39:35.909 --> 39:40.080
I see your wrinkles in your forehead.

39:41.480 --> 39:44.718
I see the U shape of your mouth.

39:45.752 --> 39:48.454
I'm wearing lipstick, and I have makeu

39:48.555 --> 39:49.756
No, you're not.

39:50.422 --> 39:51.825
Just eye makeup.

39:55.427 --> 39:58.865
Mom, I'm gonna bring you back somethin

39:58.965 --> 40:01.034
It's a new drug from the black market.

40:01.134 --> 40:02.903
Listen, I can treat you.

40:03.870 --> 40:04.771
Please don't.

40:06.039 --> 40:07.574
I don't want it.

40:07.674 --> 40:11.311
Did you ever look to God
for help with your ordeal?

40:11.410 --> 40:13.445
You cannot enter his kingdom

40:13.546 --> 40:15.081
if you kill yourself, right?

40:19.185 --> 40:20.086
No.

40:25.692 --> 40:26.860
I gotta go, mom.

40:27.961 --> 40:28.862
GB.

40:45.712 --> 40:47.614
Do you ever think about death?

40:52.619 --> 40:53.720
Every day.

40:55.755 --> 40:59.192
I think people block it
out, but she'll come.

41:00.026 --> 41:00.794
She?

41:00.894 --> 41:02.796
She sounds better, doesn't it?

41:04.197 --> 41:06.633
She would be more forgiving.

41:07.667 --> 41:08.668
I don't know.

41:08.768 --> 41:10.937
I like Robert Redford as death.

41:11.037 --> 41:12.639
Yeah, Twilight Zone.

41:14.507 --> 41:16.076
I don't think he's your type.

41:16.176 --> 41:17.544
No?

41:17.644 --> 41:18.945
Maybe you're right.

41:21.247 --> 41:22.148
It's him.

41:41.201 --> 41:42.369
Not even here yet.

41:42.469 --> 41:44.170
That guy's got the worst timing.

41:44.904 --> 41:46.873
Might as well take a look around.

41:54.481 --> 41:55.882
Tell me your thoughts.

42:04.624 --> 42:06.659
Religion and

42:08.528 --> 42:09.896
indoctrination.

42:11.698 --> 42:13.566
Maybe he's just insane.

42:15.168 --> 42:17.570
No, not this guy.

42:18.571 --> 42:19.939
No, he's not insane.

42:23.443 --> 42:24.677
On account of everything is so dark,

42:24.778 --> 42:27.213
like everything's just
fucking falling apart.

42:28.181 --> 42:32.585
It's like his world is in
the hell, like literally.

42:34.287 --> 42:35.188
And?

42:37.924 --> 42:39.959
This guy wants to believe in God,

42:41.661 --> 42:43.029
or he stopped believing.

42:44.431 --> 42:46.699
Now he thinks he might go to hell.

42:46.800 --> 42:48.501
If he didn't believe in God,

42:48.601 --> 42:50.770
he wouldn't believe in hell at either.

42:53.306 --> 42:55.308
But he had guilt.

42:55.408 --> 42:56.943
That's all his guilt.

43:00.713 --> 43:03.249
Just because you have
like different opinions,

43:04.951 --> 43:06.786
people will persecute you,

43:08.688 --> 43:10.590
just like in the old days.

43:10.690 --> 43:12.158
Just like the crusades.

43:13.827 --> 43:15.161
It's still like that.

43:17.130 --> 43:18.031
Yeah.

43:18.765 --> 43:20.366
Oh it's Dali.

43:22.168 --> 43:23.903
He's my favorite.

43:24.003 --> 43:26.673
He has a piece called,
Woman at the Window,

43:26.773 --> 43:29.976
and it's, the colors, it's blue,

43:30.076 --> 43:34.347
it's green, and it feels alive,
and it just takes you there.

43:34.447 --> 43:35.682
I stood in front of it for an hour,

43:35.782 --> 43:37.283
and then I came back for it again.

43:37.383 --> 43:39.719
I was completely obsessed,

43:39.819 --> 43:42.922
and I would stand there and just

43:43.022 --> 43:46.594
daydream and imagine that she'd be waiti

43:46.693 --> 43:48.695
for lover's ship to come.

43:49.496 --> 43:52.265
And then I thought no, that's too obviou

43:52.365 --> 43:53.233
What if

43:54.667 --> 43:56.069
he was watching her

43:56.703 --> 43:59.005
the same way you're looking at a paintin

43:59.105 --> 44:00.039
and she knew it,

44:00.140 --> 44:02.576
and she would pretend
like she didn't know,

44:02.675 --> 44:04.978
and that's how she would hook her man.

44:05.078 --> 44:07.515
And then she would turn around,

44:07.615 --> 44:09.916
and I would see her beautiful face,

44:10.584 --> 44:15.388
and her eyes would be calm
and filled with contentment

44:15.488 --> 44:19.192
and acceptance and bliss.

44:23.830 --> 44:25.965
What do you think happens when we die?

44:33.473 --> 44:35.208
I think when we die, that's it.

44:36.776 --> 44:38.945
The time that we have is what we have.

44:40.614 --> 44:42.749
I think I'm gonna make the best of it.

44:46.085 --> 44:46.986
Yo!

44:47.787 --> 44:50.190
You guys ready to do some drugs or what?

44:52.091 --> 44:52.792
Yeah.

44:52.892 --> 44:53.993
Yeah, I got it.

44:54.694 --> 44:56.664
Let's go talk over there.

44:56.763 --> 44:57.531
Okay.

44:57.631 --> 44:58.731
Come on.

45:00.733 --> 45:02.001
How long know that guy for?

45:02.101 --> 45:07.140
Not too long, actually
we just met like, tonight.

45:07.240 --> 45:08.241
- Wow.
- Yeah.

45:08.341 --> 45:09.242
Okay.

45:10.176 --> 45:10.843
All right.

45:10.944 --> 45:12.212
You guys ready to do this?

45:12.312 --> 45:13.213
Yeah.

45:14.548 --> 45:15.616
No bullshit.

45:15.715 --> 45:16.916
Okay.

45:17.016 --> 45:18.718
Here's the address, burn
it when you get there.

45:18.818 --> 45:19.687
Listen to me.

45:19.786 --> 45:21.487
You gotta be on this guy's level.

45:22.422 --> 45:23.323
What does that mean?

45:23.423 --> 45:25.258
What does that mean, this guy?

45:25.358 --> 45:27.727
What it means is, if he doesn't like you

45:27.827 --> 45:29.362
he's not gonna sell to you.

45:31.264 --> 45:33.833
And brother, if he doesn't trust you,

45:33.933 --> 45:35.368
he will fucking kill you.

45:36.936 --> 45:38.771
Honey, I'm sorry, earlier,

45:38.871 --> 45:40.940
I didn't realize who you were.

45:41.741 --> 45:42.509
Would you mind?

45:42.610 --> 45:43.443
No, it's okay.

45:43.544 --> 45:44.377
Just a quick?

45:44.477 --> 45:46.045
You're so sweet, thank you.

45:52.620 --> 45:53.520
It's an honor.

45:54.387 --> 45:55.321
Thanks.

45:55.421 --> 45:57.190
Wow, all right.

45:57.290 --> 45:58.191
Be cool.

46:00.393 --> 46:01.294
What?

46:02.295 --> 46:03.196
What?

46:11.104 --> 46:12.905
He was draped all over you.

46:14.407 --> 46:15.308
Oh he was not.

46:17.110 --> 46:18.011
Why?

46:19.513 --> 46:20.947
Are you jealous?

46:28.722 --> 46:29.822
Yeah.

46:43.336 --> 46:44.237
Give it up.

46:46.707 --> 46:48.174
You can have whatever you want, man.

46:48.274 --> 46:49.175
We're cool.

46:49.275 --> 46:51.978
Give me your fucking suggestives.

46:52.078 --> 46:54.013
We don't have suggestives.

47:02.556 --> 47:03.456
GG.

47:04.857 --> 47:05.958
GG.

47:08.428 --> 47:09.929
Crazy bitch.

47:22.208 --> 47:25.311
What the fuck is wrong with you?

47:44.263 --> 47:45.632
Okay.

47:45.733 --> 47:46.899
Now just stay in the car please?

47:46.999 --> 47:48.769
Don't open the doors for anybody, okay?

47:48.868 --> 47:50.169
Nobody.

47:50.269 --> 47:51.605
Okay.

47:51.705 --> 47:52.639
What are you doing?

47:52.740 --> 47:53.707
I'm coming with you.

47:53.807 --> 47:55.108
No!

47:55.208 --> 47:58.478
You don't trust me after everything.

47:58.579 --> 48:00.880
No, yes, no, no.

48:00.980 --> 48:04.651
Listen, I appreciate you, but you're so-

48:04.752 --> 48:06.352
- So, so what?

48:06.452 --> 48:07.453
I have to pee.

48:07.554 --> 48:08.655
Oh, okay.

48:08.756 --> 48:11.157
Go in the bushes, I'll look out for you.

48:11.257 --> 48:13.794
What kind of a girl do you think I am?

48:13.893 --> 48:15.962
GG, now isn't the time to be difficult

48:16.062 --> 48:17.263
I have to pee!

48:17.363 --> 48:18.565
Okay, fine!

48:27.775 --> 48:28.675
Hello?

48:34.748 --> 48:35.516
Greetings.

48:35.616 --> 48:36.517
Hi.

48:38.552 --> 48:39.553
Want to party?

48:41.588 --> 48:42.321
My girlfriend has to pee.

48:42.422 --> 48:44.758
Do you mind if she uses the bathroom?

48:44.858 --> 48:45.826
But of course.

48:45.925 --> 48:48.796
Hey, I'm GG.

48:48.896 --> 48:50.296
Hi GG, I'm Leif.

48:51.632 --> 48:52.566
Welcome.

48:53.700 --> 48:55.001
Come on up.

48:55.101 --> 48:57.403
The bathroom's on your right.

49:06.979 --> 49:09.683
Would you like a cocktail?

49:09.783 --> 49:11.250
302?

49:11.350 --> 49:12.118
Yes.

49:12.218 --> 49:14.987
That's my kind of girl, get up here.

49:28.968 --> 49:30.136
Leif Strong.

49:31.505 --> 49:34.373
Citizens of the Universe, Leif Strong.

49:37.109 --> 49:39.979
I didn't even recognize
you without your beard.

49:41.080 --> 49:41.849
You're awesome.

49:41.949 --> 49:43.015
Thank you.

49:43.115 --> 49:45.084
I love conspiracy theories.

49:45.184 --> 49:47.019
Do you love the word theory?

51:01.728 --> 51:02.629
See that?

51:03.897 --> 51:08.702
The signature line on every
bank issued personal check

51:08.802 --> 51:14.240
has writing so small, it's
not visible to the human eye.

51:14.708 --> 51:15.976
What?

51:16.075 --> 51:17.443
That's what they mean when they say,

51:17.544 --> 51:21.247
read the fine print
before signing anything.

51:26.252 --> 51:28.855
You've seen the owl on the dollar bill?

51:29.856 --> 51:31.758
Yeah, it's in the corner, right?

51:33.459 --> 51:35.494
There's pyramids in China.

51:35.596 --> 51:38.765
Yeah, much bigger than the ones in Giza.

51:39.866 --> 51:42.234
And you know what they found inside?

51:42.335 --> 51:46.105
10-foot-tall mummies with red hair.

51:46.205 --> 51:48.875
Hello Norscot's calling.

51:48.976 --> 51:50.343
The government freaked out.

51:50.443 --> 51:51.979
They covered it with dirt.

51:52.079 --> 51:54.047
Now it's just a giant mountain.

51:54.146 --> 51:56.182
Discovery of the century, right?

51:56.282 --> 51:58.819
Oh no, they found another one.

51:59.519 --> 52:04.190
At the bottom of the ocean
in Puerto Rico, oh shit!

52:04.290 --> 52:06.158
It gets better.

52:07.894 --> 52:08.795
Mars.

52:10.429 --> 52:11.965
Damn.

52:12.065 --> 52:13.567
Did we go to the moon.

52:13.667 --> 52:14.568
Yeah,

52:15.736 --> 52:17.403
but not by Apollo.

52:18.337 --> 52:19.806
They're masking the truth

52:19.906 --> 52:22.609
with yet another lie, those idiots.

52:23.409 --> 52:25.344
Can you believe there are still people

52:25.444 --> 52:28.515
that think the Earth is flat?

52:28.615 --> 52:30.817
But why would governments
go to such lengths

52:30.917 --> 52:32.284
to cover this up?

52:34.220 --> 52:35.388
All done?

52:36.322 --> 52:37.423
Shut up Scully.

52:38.424 --> 52:40.359
The truth is in plain sight.

52:40.459 --> 52:43.964
You just need to learn
how to read the symbols.

52:44.064 --> 52:45.632
The Gods never left.

52:45.732 --> 52:47.567
We are all of stock.

52:48.535 --> 52:51.938
You know, people see aliens and UFOs

52:52.039 --> 52:53.974
all over the US all the time,

52:54.074 --> 52:56.143
and they act like they don't exist.

52:56.242 --> 52:57.376
Right.

52:57.476 --> 52:59.813
The fact that we exist,
why can't others exist?

53:00.446 --> 53:02.214
But do we really exist?

53:02.314 --> 53:04.250
Are we not holograms?

53:04.918 --> 53:06.053
Every portion of the universe

53:06.153 --> 53:08.220
carries a semblance of the whole,

53:08.320 --> 53:09.856
like William Blake said,

53:09.956 --> 53:13.593
you can find the universe
in a grain of sand.

53:16.328 --> 53:21.568
Bravo, bravo, GG, a
holographic universe.

53:22.401 --> 53:24.004
Your girlfriend rocks.

53:24.104 --> 53:25.572
She's not my girlfriend.

53:27.206 --> 53:28.508
You said she was.

53:29.943 --> 53:31.444
No.

53:32.913 --> 53:33.814
She's a.

53:40.087 --> 53:41.588
She's the love of my life.

53:46.593 --> 53:49.029
Thank you for that suggestion, GG.

53:49.830 --> 53:55.001
Speaking of suggestions,
have you got the money?

53:55.102 --> 53:56.002
I do.

54:05.946 --> 54:07.881
We're all gods.

54:07.981 --> 54:08.882
You'll see.

54:12.686 --> 54:13.587
You'll see.

54:19.559 --> 54:21.393
Did I pass his psychic test?

54:21.494 --> 54:23.163
There's no test.

54:23.262 --> 54:24.598
We work pretty well together.

54:24.698 --> 54:27.134
Look, you're pretty charming
but you shouldn't be here.

54:27.234 --> 54:29.736
How many more parties
do we have to go to?

54:29.836 --> 54:32.105
After this, suggestives are the party.

54:32.205 --> 54:34.608
Listen, I really appreciate you,

54:34.708 --> 54:37.210
and now he'll set up a
change in the bathtub,

54:37.309 --> 54:39.012
but it's still very dangerous.

54:39.112 --> 54:40.312
Leif seems pretty harmless to me.

54:40.412 --> 54:43.049
I can't find my phone.

54:43.150 --> 54:45.218
You want us to call you?

54:45.317 --> 54:46.452
You know that saying,

54:46.553 --> 54:49.823
your life is flashing before your eyes?

54:49.923 --> 54:54.027
Yeah well, that's when the
brain knows it's gonna die.

54:54.127 --> 54:56.096
You know what it does?

54:56.196 --> 54:58.131
It's just reevaluating itself, you know,

54:58.231 --> 55:01.868
it's flashing all of your
memories in your whole life.

55:01.968 --> 55:04.303
And so any time I want to
remember something like,

55:04.403 --> 55:06.106
where did I put my fucking phone?

55:06.206 --> 55:10.309
I just put this gun in my
mouth and I really pretend.

55:17.584 --> 55:19.719
I put it in my back pocket.

55:22.756 --> 55:23.657
The idiot.

55:24.791 --> 55:25.826
Here you go.

55:28.995 --> 55:30.362
We gotta go.

55:31.198 --> 55:33.033
Oh wait, one more thing.

55:34.333 --> 55:38.071
Mandela will affect
the world on champions.

55:41.308 --> 55:42.408
Right.

55:46.613 --> 55:49.316
It's been a pleasure, yeah.

55:53.653 --> 55:56.156
Yeah baby, yeah it's the desert baby.

55:56.256 --> 55:57.356
The desert baby.

55:57.456 --> 55:58.959
I feel like dancing.

55:59.059 --> 56:00.459
Oh my God, everybody's
talking about the secret show.

56:00.560 --> 56:01.828
We should go there tonight.

56:01.928 --> 56:03.429
Okay, let's go.

56:23.149 --> 56:24.383
I guess we're early.

56:24.483 --> 56:26.219
What is this place called?

56:26.319 --> 56:27.921
Like the Hidden Gem.

56:30.323 --> 56:33.425
It's called the Hidden Gem.

56:33.526 --> 56:35.795
Should we just um?

57:22.742 --> 57:24.577
You want to get out of here?

57:34.421 --> 57:35.522
I'm so sorry.

57:36.189 --> 57:37.157
I'll be right back.

57:38.024 --> 57:40.627
He put this together,
he'll know what's going on.

57:43.630 --> 57:45.065
Hey, hey.

57:45.165 --> 57:46.465
Hey.

57:47.801 --> 57:49.102
I guess we're early.

57:50.337 --> 57:51.204
You know, I was gonna surprise you.

57:51.304 --> 57:53.073
I didn't know you knew.

57:53.173 --> 57:53.940
What?

57:54.040 --> 57:55.375
You're here with SIN5.

57:55.474 --> 57:56.242
Who?

57:56.343 --> 57:57.510
You, you're with SIN5.

58:00.613 --> 58:01.982
You're with her, right?

58:12.592 --> 58:15.729
I'm so excited for the
unveiling of SIN5 tonight.

58:16.396 --> 58:19.032
I can't wait to see what they look like.

58:19.132 --> 58:21.935
Wow, great jacket.

58:22.035 --> 58:23.036
Thank you.

58:23.870 --> 58:26.206
So you came with GB, right?

58:27.374 --> 58:29.109
- She's SIN5.
- She's SIN5?

58:29.209 --> 58:30.510
She's SIN5.

58:36.716 --> 58:38.985
It's been a while since
he's brought somebody around,

58:39.085 --> 58:41.588
since Angie.

58:41.688 --> 58:44.090
He told you about his ex, right?

58:44.190 --> 58:45.625
Yeah, of course.

58:45.725 --> 58:50.797
He's been so open about her suicide.

58:51.498 --> 58:54.234
I think it's part of his healing process

58:54.334 --> 58:56.569
but it's great he's moving on.

58:57.871 --> 58:58.772
Yeah.

58:59.606 --> 59:01.207
We need to talk.

59:01.307 --> 59:02.308
Yeah, we do.

59:04.444 --> 59:06.012
You want to go first?

59:06.112 --> 59:06.746
Yeah, I actually do.

59:06.846 --> 59:08.648
So when were you gonna tell me?

59:08.748 --> 59:09.549
Tell you what?

59:09.649 --> 59:11.017
That you're freaking SIN5.

59:15.989 --> 59:18.191
I was making it up as I went along.

59:18.992 --> 59:21.227
That's the first honest thing
you've said all night then.

59:21.327 --> 59:24.597
You're a pretty damn good
actress, you know that?

59:24.697 --> 59:26.032
You even sold it to my mom.

59:26.132 --> 59:27.434
I wasn't lying.

59:27.535 --> 59:29.069
So what were you gonna do?

59:29.169 --> 59:31.471
Just like, bye GB.

59:31.571 --> 59:32.839
See you later GB.

59:33.606 --> 59:35.509
- Was that it?
- No.

59:35.608 --> 59:37.210
- It was just.
- What?

59:37.310 --> 59:38.611
- I was just.
- What?

59:39.813 --> 59:40.947
I was in the moment,

59:41.047 --> 59:44.552
and I just wanted to be
with somebody real and,

59:44.651 --> 59:47.320
and you know, who the fuck knows

59:47.420 --> 59:50.023
what's gonna happen to my career.

59:50.723 --> 59:52.759
And why is that so bad?

59:52.859 --> 59:54.227
You're right, we never promised anythi

59:54.327 --> 59:55.595
to each other, right?

59:56.930 --> 59:58.498
I never judged you.

59:58.598 --> 01:00:00.266
Why do you get off judging me?

01:00:14.314 --> 01:00:15.248
It's this night.

01:00:16.816 --> 01:00:17.917
It's been crazy.

01:00:20.253 --> 01:00:21.154
It's squashed.

01:00:22.088 --> 01:00:22.989
Okay?

01:00:24.390 --> 01:00:25.291
It's squashed.

01:00:26.392 --> 01:00:27.861
I didn't mean any of that.

01:00:37.103 --> 01:00:38.004
I'm sorry.

01:00:46.846 --> 01:00:48.348
Don't do that again.

01:00:56.689 --> 01:00:58.258
It's your turn.

01:01:01.361 --> 01:01:04.130
Lately I've been thinking
about bucket lists.

01:01:06.199 --> 01:01:08.801
Why do you wait to do
them until you're old?

01:01:09.502 --> 01:01:12.438
I want to do it all, tonight.

01:01:16.376 --> 01:01:17.710
What does it matter?

01:01:18.978 --> 01:01:21.848
We're not gonna see each
other again after tonight.

01:01:23.149 --> 01:01:24.250
I mean you'll probably go on tour

01:01:24.350 --> 01:01:26.052
for like the next 10 years.

01:01:27.020 --> 01:01:28.788
I wasn't kidding earlier.

01:01:30.390 --> 01:01:32.425
I dare you to marry me.

01:01:38.498 --> 01:01:39.966
I'm not going to Vegas.

01:01:40.800 --> 01:01:43.069
I know you, you're just like me.

01:01:43.169 --> 01:01:47.073
You don't want to live a normal
life, you want to be free.

01:01:47.173 --> 01:01:48.841
If we have the potential
to love each other,

01:01:48.942 --> 01:01:53.012
and if we can feel yes,
then we're married.

01:01:54.347 --> 01:01:56.282
You just want to go through the motion

01:01:56.382 --> 01:01:57.685
but without the end result.

01:01:58.318 --> 01:02:01.421
If we love each other, then it's real.

01:02:08.294 --> 01:02:11.097
We're never going to
see each other again.

01:02:24.110 --> 01:02:25.778
Not until we're married.

01:02:28.348 --> 01:02:29.249
I need a ring.

01:02:46.099 --> 01:02:47.900
Do you need anything?

01:02:48.001 --> 01:02:50.036
I'll let you figure that one out.

01:02:51.538 --> 01:02:52.438
Right.

01:03:33.046 --> 01:03:35.181
Something has to happen first.

01:04:11.518 --> 01:04:13.353
What a gorgeous view.

01:04:15.756 --> 01:04:18.191
I don't know what to say.

01:04:18.291 --> 01:04:20.126
Anything is possible with you.

01:04:21.928 --> 01:04:24.497
I wouldn't want to change
anything about tonight.

01:04:25.198 --> 01:04:27.467
I wouldn't want to change
anything about you.

01:04:27.568 --> 01:04:28.802
If I can do it all over again,

01:04:28.901 --> 01:04:30.503
I wouldn't change a fucking thing.

01:04:31.938 --> 01:04:34.808
I understand if we'd never
see each other again.

01:04:34.907 --> 01:04:36.943
So I wouldn't bottle everything up.

01:04:37.877 --> 01:04:39.946
I just to freeze everything in time,

01:04:40.647 --> 01:04:41.548
because it's you.

01:04:43.316 --> 01:04:45.151
I knew it from when I saw you.

01:04:46.386 --> 01:04:48.589
I will cherish the moments that we had.

01:05:03.604 --> 01:05:05.371
I heard you say yes.

01:05:37.905 --> 01:05:38.839
I mean who cares

01:05:38.938 --> 01:05:40.273
if we don't know what they look like?

01:05:40.373 --> 01:05:42.609
Maybe the mystery just adds to the art.

01:05:42.709 --> 01:05:44.277
This is the SIN5.

01:05:47.881 --> 01:05:49.650
- Excuse me.
- What?

01:05:53.085 --> 01:05:54.688
I thought you liked SIN5.

01:05:54.788 --> 01:05:55.556
Yeah.

01:05:55.656 --> 01:05:57.290
That's our song.

01:05:57.390 --> 01:06:00.026
It was?

01:06:00.126 --> 01:06:01.628
What? What?

01:06:02.995 --> 01:06:04.230
Special occasions.

01:06:16.309 --> 01:06:19.513
Will you please stop, will
you just talk to me for a sec?

01:06:21.414 --> 01:06:22.583
Nice pool.

01:06:22.683 --> 01:06:24.317
Where are you going?

01:06:24.417 --> 01:06:25.384
It's December.

01:06:25.485 --> 01:06:28.154
Look, it's really cold,
can we just go inside?

01:06:28.254 --> 01:06:29.188
What are you doing?

01:06:29.288 --> 01:06:31.290
Why are you taking off your coat for?

01:06:32.191 --> 01:06:33.827
What's going on?

01:06:33.927 --> 01:06:36.062
Will you just talk to me?

01:06:36.162 --> 01:06:37.531
Look, I'm sorry.

01:06:37.631 --> 01:06:40.132
Whatever it is, I'm really, really sorry

01:06:40.968 --> 01:06:43.637
Prove to me that I
didn't make a mistake.

01:06:45.506 --> 01:06:46.405
What the fuck?

01:07:09.128 --> 01:07:10.129
I hate you.

01:07:10.229 --> 01:07:11.798
I hate you too.

01:07:23.810 --> 01:07:25.111
Uh, really?

01:07:26.813 --> 01:07:29.282
I just put it on and then.

01:07:33.554 --> 01:07:36.155
I'm gonna go and fix a us suggestives.

01:07:56.843 --> 01:07:58.545
No talking.

01:07:58.645 --> 01:08:00.246
I get to be the judge.

01:08:03.517 --> 01:08:04.417
Drink.

01:08:32.045 --> 01:08:36.381
So, what do you want to suggest?

01:08:38.719 --> 01:08:39.620
To be.

01:08:41.622 --> 01:08:42.522
Yeah?

01:08:44.323 --> 01:08:46.292
Let's be stardust.

01:10:00.332 --> 01:10:02.435
Are you sure I can keep your clothes?

01:10:04.303 --> 01:10:06.973
They're something to remember me by

01:10:07.074 --> 01:10:08.307
so you won't forget.

01:10:09.976 --> 01:10:11.745
My ride is gonna be here, soon.

01:10:13.312 --> 01:10:17.216
You're so beautiful,
I was thinking that,

01:10:18.284 --> 01:10:20.219
I wish I could take back my dare.

01:10:22.522 --> 01:10:25.424
You can't change the rules
on me, that's not fair.

01:10:26.693 --> 01:10:28.795
We never talked about the goodbye part

01:10:29.663 --> 01:10:30.564
That's easy.

01:10:32.431 --> 01:10:33.633
I'm gonna hold you,

01:10:35.669 --> 01:10:37.403
and then I'm gonna kiss you,

01:10:39.338 --> 01:10:40.807
and I'm gonna say goodbye.

01:10:43.342 --> 01:10:44.911
And let me be who I am.

01:10:51.184 --> 01:10:52.552
And I love you.

01:11:01.061 --> 01:11:01.995
It's okay.

01:11:03.362 --> 01:11:05.331
You don't have to take back.

01:11:18.444 --> 01:11:20.279
Why are you taking fentanyl?

01:11:22.115 --> 01:11:24.818
I need you to tell me, why
you are taking fentanyl.

01:11:25.752 --> 01:11:30.991
Only if you had pancreatic
cancer you would take this stuff.

01:11:35.095 --> 01:11:36.797
I have one month.

01:11:55.182 --> 01:11:56.116
We have suggestives.

01:11:56.216 --> 01:11:57.250
It can cure you.

01:11:57.349 --> 01:11:58.484
We'll get more.

01:11:59.318 --> 01:12:01.221
No it can't.

01:12:01.320 --> 01:12:03.056
We just had cosmic fucking sex.

01:12:03.156 --> 01:12:05.125
What do you mean it can't?

01:12:05.225 --> 01:12:06.593
I leave on my own terms.

01:12:06.693 --> 01:12:07.594
What are you gonna do,

01:12:07.694 --> 01:12:09.029
you're gonna party yourself to death?

01:12:09.129 --> 01:12:10.597
It's my choice.

01:12:12.232 --> 01:12:13.300
Don't you have a family?

01:12:13.399 --> 01:12:14.768
What about your fans?

01:12:15.869 --> 01:12:18.839
You have no idea how to breaks you dow

01:12:20.372 --> 01:12:21.473
None.

01:12:26.780 --> 01:12:27.747
Yes I do.

01:12:36.488 --> 01:12:39.693
GB, you're scaring me.

01:12:43.395 --> 01:12:44.496
No.

01:12:48.268 --> 01:12:50.136
We manifested each other,

01:12:50.237 --> 01:12:52.739
so you have to see it through.

01:12:53.740 --> 01:12:55.141
No, GB.

01:12:55.242 --> 01:12:57.476
You said you loved me.

01:12:59.012 --> 01:13:00.412
Did it.

01:13:03.850 --> 01:13:05.151
GB, the pills.

01:13:10.489 --> 01:13:11.591
The pills.

01:13:14.227 --> 01:13:15.128
The pills.

01:13:20.834 --> 01:13:21.735
No no no.

01:13:53.465 --> 01:13:55.669
I'll shave my legs for you every night.

01:14:00.640 --> 01:14:03.810
I love you, I'll give my life for you.

01:15:16.916 --> 01:15:19.185
I will do whatever you want to suggest

01:15:21.287 --> 01:15:23.023
I didn't know how to tell you.

01:15:24.758 --> 01:15:26.793
You've taken suggestives before.

01:15:26.893 --> 01:15:28.895
They can't fix my cancer.

01:15:32.732 --> 01:15:34.667
We can't end it like this.

01:15:36.269 --> 01:15:41.241
My whole life has been
compromises, and that ends tonight.

01:15:42.342 --> 01:15:43.710
I'm taking control.

01:16:20.346 --> 01:16:21.247
GG?

01:16:22.516 --> 01:16:23.850
We'll start over, okay?

01:16:24.584 --> 01:16:25.852
My name is Sasha.

01:16:26.653 --> 01:16:28.588
I just a fucking drug dealer,

01:16:29.823 --> 01:16:31.091
and I fell for you.

01:16:31.825 --> 01:16:33.126
I'm so sorry, GG.

01:16:35.595 --> 01:16:36.696
Sasha?

01:16:40.200 --> 01:16:41.201
I'm Tasha.

01:16:42.735 --> 01:16:44.871
I'm the lead singer of SIN5,

01:16:45.872 --> 01:16:47.640
and I will end my life

01:16:47.740 --> 01:16:51.311
at the break of dawn on
stage at the Hidden Gem.

01:16:53.480 --> 01:16:54.380
Goodbye, GB.

01:17:12.765 --> 01:17:14.267
What'd you do?

01:17:40.326 --> 01:17:41.961
Alex.

01:17:42.061 --> 01:17:42.962
Drive.

01:18:12.192 --> 01:18:13.426

01:22:16.369 --> 01:22:19.205
I'm not here to stop you.

01:22:19.305 --> 01:22:20.206
GB.

01:22:21.842 --> 01:22:26.112
I just want to be with you.

01:22:26.212 --> 01:22:28.481
I'm so sorry, I fucked up.

01:22:28.582 --> 01:22:29.616
I fucked up.

01:22:34.755 --> 01:22:35.722
I love you.

01:22:42.563 --> 01:22:43.996
I love you, GG.

01:22:46.667 --> 01:22:47.634
I'm free.

01:22:50.470 --> 01:22:51.437
So are you.
