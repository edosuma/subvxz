WEBVTT

00:26.960 --> 00:28.720
Has anyone seen my hair pin?

00:28.720 --> 00:31.080
I can't find my other sock.

00:31.080 --> 00:32.440
Oh, um...

00:35.040 --> 00:37.080
Oh! Darrell, here.

00:37.080 --> 00:38.760
Oh, thank you. Irene, catch!

00:38.760 --> 00:40.280
Alicia!

00:40.280 --> 00:42.840
You want it? Good catch! Please!

00:42.840 --> 00:46.520
It's not funny! Good catch.
Darrell, come on.

00:46.520 --> 00:48.880
Alicia. Mary-Lou, please.

00:48.880 --> 00:50.440
Here, Mary-Lou, catch.

00:50.440 --> 00:52.040
Pass it. Pass!

00:55.040 --> 00:56.520
Oh, Sally.

00:57.560 --> 00:59.840
Please stop messing around.

00:59.840 --> 01:02.520
If Matron sees this mess,
you know that I'm the one who's

01:02.520 --> 01:04.120
going to get into trouble.

01:04.120 --> 01:05.160
ALL: Sorry.

01:11.960 --> 01:13.240
Oh, Darrell, come here.

01:13.240 --> 01:15.040
I have something to show you. Come.

01:16.400 --> 01:19.120
My brother sent a new trick.
It looks like the best one yet.

01:19.120 --> 01:22.280
"A Sneeze Boy's Sneeze."

01:22.280 --> 01:24.200
What does that mean? We'll soon find
out?

01:24.200 --> 01:25.440
Let's play it on Mam'zelle.

01:25.440 --> 01:28.160
I don't want Sally to get
in trouble, any of us.

01:28.160 --> 01:29.640
She won't. We won't. Are you sure?

01:29.640 --> 01:33.200
What are you two up to now?
Uh...nothing.

01:33.200 --> 01:37.800
I was just wondering about Miss
Grayling's plans about Mr Thomas

01:37.800 --> 01:39.040
taking down the school.

01:39.040 --> 01:41.680
I know you're worried, but let
the grown-ups deal with it.

01:41.680 --> 01:42.960
Now, come on.

01:42.960 --> 01:45.400
We need to go polish our shoes
for the school trip

01:45.400 --> 01:47.440
and tidy up before breakfast.

01:50.440 --> 01:52.560
Please, Darrell, we haven't
played a trick in ages.

01:52.560 --> 01:54.280
No, Alicia. Come on.

01:54.280 --> 01:56.320
Everyone deserves a laugh,
especially Sally.

01:56.320 --> 01:58.960
And you know what Mam'zelle has
planned for us today, don't you?

01:58.960 --> 02:00.800
Nouns and pronouns?

02:00.800 --> 02:02.320
I don't know.

02:02.320 --> 02:05.200
Come on, Darrell, please.

02:07.000 --> 02:08.040
Fine.

02:08.040 --> 02:09.720
LAUGHTER

02:09.720 --> 02:11.440
Come on. We'd better hurry.

02:34.640 --> 02:36.880
I can't wait to see the castle
tomorrow. Me neither.

02:36.880 --> 02:38.720
Feels like an age
since our last school trip.

02:38.720 --> 02:40.840
Oh, my grandmother sent me a bag
of boiled sweets

02:40.840 --> 02:43.640
for travel sickness,
so I'll hand them out in the coach.

02:43.640 --> 02:46.920
That's so kind, Mary-Lou. You can
sit next to me, Mary-Lou.

02:46.920 --> 02:49.920
I shall need the window seat, as you
know, I get awfully travel sick.

02:49.920 --> 02:52.120
Do you ever think about anyone
but yourself, Gwen?

02:52.120 --> 02:54.080
Told you.
Why on Earth would she do that?

02:54.080 --> 02:56.160
SNIGGERING

02:56.160 --> 03:00.000
Actually, I was going to offer
to treat you all to ices.

03:00.000 --> 03:03.200
Really? Thanks, Gwen.
Ices for everyone?

03:03.200 --> 03:05.800
Goodness, your parents must send
you lashings of pocket money.

03:05.800 --> 03:08.080
Now, I'll definitely have a fun day.

03:11.920 --> 03:15.600
Has no-one seen my hair pin?
I swore I put it away.

03:16.680 --> 03:18.920
Have you looked under your bed?
Mm...

03:20.640 --> 03:21.800
It's not there.

03:21.800 --> 03:24.320
Oh, I was a gift from my mother.
I must find it.

03:27.960 --> 03:30.000
What does it look like? We'll help
you search.

03:30.000 --> 03:33.920
It's silver with the three pearls.
Four, but one fell off.

03:37.600 --> 03:39.040
Have you seen it, Gwen?

03:39.040 --> 03:40.680
No, I haven't!

03:40.680 --> 03:43.160
We'll have to leave it for now.
We'll be late for lessons.

05:06.040 --> 05:08.960
"Crush the sneezing pellets
and sprinkle the powder.

05:08.960 --> 05:10.880
"Two - for the pellet to take
full effect,

05:10.880 --> 05:14.520
"it must be in close proximity
to the subject."

05:14.520 --> 05:17.760
Are we sure this is safe? Yes.
I don't know. Maybe Sally was right.

05:17.760 --> 05:20.200
SHE SCOFFS
Will you stop worrying about Sally?

05:20.200 --> 05:21.320
Come on, hurry.

05:34.880 --> 05:36.920
LAUGHTER

05:34.880 --> 05:36.920
There we go.

05:37.840 --> 05:39.520
Perfect. Step back.

05:39.520 --> 05:41.440
Oh! Darrell. Sorry.

05:41.440 --> 05:43.600
Come on, hurry, before we start
sneezing.

05:43.600 --> 05:46.920
Have we found them all?
Yes, I think so.

05:46.920 --> 05:49.440
Quick before Mam'zelle comes.

05:49.440 --> 05:51.320
LAUGHTER

05:51.320 --> 05:55.120
You know, it's nice to have the fun
old Darrell back. Come on.

06:05.880 --> 06:08.720
Ron, I've been looking all over
for you.

06:08.720 --> 06:12.080
Be a sport and cycle into town for
me, please.

06:12.080 --> 06:13.480
Run out of treats, have you?

06:13.480 --> 06:16.360
Actually I need you to take this
to the antique shop

06:16.360 --> 06:18.320
in the village and sell it.

06:20.240 --> 06:23.440
It was a gift from my great-aunt,

06:23.440 --> 06:25.040
but it's not really to my taste.

06:26.040 --> 06:28.720
Sorry, I've got a lot of work
to do today.

06:28.720 --> 06:30.200
Please, Ron.

06:30.200 --> 06:32.400
MOCKINGLY: Please, Ron.

06:32.400 --> 06:35.040
You mustn't say a word.

06:35.040 --> 06:37.600
You see, I promised the girls ices.

06:37.600 --> 06:40.080
My pocket money hasn't come
through this month.

06:40.080 --> 06:42.640
Tell them, they will understand.
I can't.

06:42.640 --> 06:45.480
It's humiliating not to keep a
promise. Please.

06:45.480 --> 06:48.680
I wouldn't ask if I wasn't
desperate.

06:48.680 --> 06:50.080
That looks quite precious.

06:50.080 --> 06:51.600
You sure you want to sell it?

06:51.600 --> 06:53.840
The girls are ever so excited

06:53.840 --> 06:56.200
and I wouldn't want to let
them down.

06:56.200 --> 06:59.280
I'll give you money for an ice
too. Please.

07:00.640 --> 07:03.960
All right, then. I'll try and get
you a good price for it.

07:03.960 --> 07:05.200
Thank you.

07:05.200 --> 07:08.200
And don't tell anyone, will you?

07:08.200 --> 07:12.520
It's just I'd be awfully embarrassed
if they knew.

07:12.520 --> 07:13.800
Scout's honour.

07:33.480 --> 07:34.800
Bonjour, les filles.

07:34.800 --> 07:37.200
ALL: Bonjour, Mam'zelle Rougier.
Allez, allez.

07:37.200 --> 07:41.120
Mam'zelle, did you speak to Miss
Grayling about Mr Thomas' plans?

07:41.120 --> 07:44.240
Yes, yes, I told Miss Grayling
the second form were concerned.

07:44.240 --> 07:46.240
Now let us focus on the lessons,
s'il vous plait.

07:49.840 --> 07:51.800
Noms... Not long now.

07:53.280 --> 07:55.400
Pronoms. Mam'zelle.

07:55.400 --> 07:57.520
Do we have to? Silence.

07:57.520 --> 08:01.120
Considering how little you know...

08:01.120 --> 08:03.160
..you should not complain now.

08:08.640 --> 08:11.200
Now, open your books...

08:11.200 --> 08:12.520
SHE SNEEZES

08:12.520 --> 08:13.800
ALL: Bless you.

08:13.800 --> 08:15.720
Pardon.

08:16.920 --> 08:18.400
Now, let's begin with...

08:21.400 --> 08:24.000
SHE SNEEZES
LAUGHTER

08:24.000 --> 08:26.000
Oh...

08:26.000 --> 08:27.640
SHE SNEEZES

08:27.640 --> 08:30.520
Mam'zelle.

08:27.640 --> 08:30.520
SHE SNEEZES

08:30.520 --> 08:31.760
Mam'zelle.

08:33.440 --> 08:34.800
Merci.

08:35.840 --> 08:37.240
Oh!

08:37.240 --> 08:41.080
I'm sorry, girls, I could not help
it. I...

08:41.080 --> 08:42.880
SHE SNEEZES

08:42.880 --> 08:45.040
Oh, dear me.

08:45.040 --> 08:48.240
Here is another...

08:45.040 --> 08:48.240
SHE GASPS

08:48.240 --> 08:49.440
SHE SNEEZES

08:50.880 --> 08:54.560
Girls, it is not kind to laugh
at another's disc...

08:54.560 --> 08:56.360
SHE SNEEZES

08:56.360 --> 08:59.440
Oh, Sally, can you collect them
for me

08:59.440 --> 09:02.360
and continue the lesson
while I compose myself?

09:02.360 --> 09:05.520
Yes, Mam'zelle. Are you going to be
all right? Oh, I hope so.

09:05.520 --> 09:07.680
Never have I sneezed so much before.

09:07.680 --> 09:11.080
SHE SNEEZES
LAUGHTER

09:12.600 --> 09:14.800
What was that?
Did something crawl up her nose?

09:14.800 --> 09:16.280
Was that one of your tricks?

09:16.280 --> 09:17.360
It was, bravo!

09:17.360 --> 09:19.400
It got us out of the most
boring lesson.

09:19.400 --> 09:22.640
Ladies, may I present to you
- Sneeze, Boy, Sneeze.

09:22.640 --> 09:25.640
Or shall I say,
sneeze, Mam'zelle, sneeze?

09:25.640 --> 09:28.200
LAUGHTER

09:25.640 --> 09:28.200
That was topping.

09:28.200 --> 09:30.000
Why thank you.
But I couldn't have done it

09:30.000 --> 09:32.440
without my marvellous assistant,
Darrell Williams.

09:32.440 --> 09:33.720
Isn't she swell?

09:33.720 --> 09:35.680
That wasn't funny or kind.

09:35.680 --> 09:38.160
Mam'zelle was really uncomfortable.

09:38.160 --> 09:40.680
Don't be such a bore, Sally.
You were right.

09:40.680 --> 09:42.880
If she found out, she would
have spoiled the trick.

09:42.880 --> 09:44.480
Darrell?

09:44.480 --> 09:48.320
No, I didn't mean it like that.
It's not a big deal, Sally.

09:54.880 --> 09:57.320
LOUD THUD

10:05.360 --> 10:09.240
You girls have nothing better
to do than waste my time.

10:10.360 --> 10:13.040
Has anyone seen Irene's hair pin?

10:13.040 --> 10:15.280
We did try and look for it
this morning, Matron.

10:15.280 --> 10:18.400
Well, you've all become very untidy
and careless.

10:18.400 --> 10:21.120
I had Georgina Thomas complaining
about her mirror going missing

10:21.120 --> 10:23.480
and now this. Come along.

10:23.480 --> 10:25.040
Tidy this room from top to bottom.

10:25.040 --> 10:28.040
Open up your trunks. I will show you
how to do things properly.

11:00.200 --> 11:01.960
SHE GASPS

11:03.080 --> 11:05.920
SHE SNEEZES

11:03.080 --> 11:05.920
Oh, cor!

11:12.000 --> 11:14.520
SHE SNEEZES

11:21.560 --> 11:24.120
SHE SNEEZES

11:26.560 --> 11:28.040
SHE SNEEZES

11:35.240 --> 11:37.200
Rolling is not folding.

11:39.880 --> 11:41.880
Hurry up, Gwendoline, we haven't
all evening.

11:41.880 --> 11:45.480
You haven't even opened your trunk
yet. I can't find my key.

11:45.480 --> 11:47.160
Key?

11:48.160 --> 11:50.040
Why is your trunk locked?

11:50.040 --> 11:51.600
To keep my things safe.

11:53.120 --> 11:54.520
Oh, give me strength.

11:54.520 --> 11:57.920
Right. Has anyone seen Gwen's key?

11:57.920 --> 12:00.160
You had it this morning.
We saw you open your trunk.

12:03.080 --> 12:04.320
Well, Miss Lacey?

12:04.320 --> 12:07.200
Girls! Excusez-moi, Matron.

12:07.200 --> 12:09.400
But I must speak to the head of
form.

12:11.480 --> 12:13.840
Continue tidying, please.

12:13.840 --> 12:15.480
I'll be back later.

12:16.840 --> 12:18.880
Come with me, Sally.

12:18.880 --> 12:21.440
The rest of you stay here.

12:27.600 --> 12:28.960
Alicia.

12:28.960 --> 12:31.800
THEY MOUTH

12:39.480 --> 12:42.880
You girls continue to test me

12:42.880 --> 12:45.120
and you think I do not know.

12:46.480 --> 12:48.360
It was a trick, was it not?

12:48.360 --> 12:49.600
A trick?

12:49.600 --> 12:50.840
The sneezing!

12:52.320 --> 12:53.920
First that drawing.

12:55.280 --> 12:57.000
And now this.

12:57.000 --> 12:59.520
Do you girls not like me any more?

12:59.520 --> 13:00.920
ALICIA SNIGGERS

13:00.920 --> 13:03.360
What have I done to deserve
all this?

13:06.000 --> 13:08.040
And so, I mean, was it a trick?

13:09.720 --> 13:12.160
No, Mam'zelle. I don't think so.

13:13.480 --> 13:16.240
I hope you are telling the truth,

13:16.240 --> 13:20.560
if not, you and whoever is
responsible will both be

13:20.560 --> 13:22.840
in a great deal of trouble.

13:22.840 --> 13:24.520
J'ai compris?

13:31.160 --> 13:33.120
It's not me spoiling your fun.

13:33.120 --> 13:36.760
I just don't want to see anyone hurt
or get in trouble.

13:36.760 --> 13:38.960
Let's hope Mam'zelle doesn't take
it any further.

13:44.480 --> 13:48.120
I'm sure those girls played
a cruel trick.

13:48.120 --> 13:49.640
Oh, you French are so dramatic.

13:49.640 --> 13:52.680
Probably just got a little bit
of dust up your nose.

13:54.440 --> 13:55.480
Hmm.

14:03.520 --> 14:05.840
SHE SNEEZES

14:05.840 --> 14:07.480
Oh.

14:15.880 --> 14:17.640
It's...

14:15.880 --> 14:17.640
SHE SNEEZES

14:24.800 --> 14:26.840
So how much did you get?

14:26.840 --> 14:30.320
The owner of the shop said
once the brooch is sold,

14:30.320 --> 14:32.400
take that back to collect
your money.

14:33.760 --> 14:34.960
What?

14:34.960 --> 14:37.280
I'm sorry, but they don't pay
up front.

14:37.280 --> 14:39.680
What about my money
for the school trip?

14:39.680 --> 14:40.960
You really are quite useless.

14:40.960 --> 14:44.920
I left my chores to go into town
for you. Well, it was for nothing.

14:44.920 --> 14:48.040
Now what I was going to do? Say
you'll treat them on your next trip.

14:52.760 --> 14:53.880
KNOCKING

14:53.880 --> 14:55.320
Come in.

14:58.600 --> 14:59.640
Come here.

15:05.800 --> 15:07.760
What is it?

15:07.760 --> 15:11.280
Do not play the fool. You know
it is a sneezing pellet.

15:11.280 --> 15:13.920
You have all the girls, Sally.

15:13.920 --> 15:16.400
Now answer me, honestly -

15:16.400 --> 15:19.280
did someone play a trick on
Miss Rougier?

15:20.840 --> 15:22.280
Yes, Matron.

15:22.280 --> 15:24.240
I knew it.

15:24.240 --> 15:26.200
How could you lie to me?

15:26.200 --> 15:29.360
I only found out after you started
sneezing.

15:30.920 --> 15:33.400
Which of the girls is responsible?

15:34.960 --> 15:36.200
Sally.

15:42.880 --> 15:45.400
Well, then we can only assume
it was you. No.

15:45.400 --> 15:48.760
In case you have forgotten,
you are head of form.

15:48.760 --> 15:52.160
We should be able to rely
on you to tell us the truth.

15:52.160 --> 15:55.800
Sneezing tricks can cause
all kinds of harm.

15:55.800 --> 15:57.920
I know, and I'm so sorry, matron.

15:57.920 --> 15:59.840
It's far too late for that.

15:59.840 --> 16:02.560
Not only did you lie
to Miss Rougier,

16:02.560 --> 16:05.680
but you refused to tell us
who is to blame.

16:06.680 --> 16:09.280
I shall inform Miss Grayling
you will be excluded

16:09.280 --> 16:10.600
from the school trip.

16:10.600 --> 16:13.600
Give you time to reflect
on the error of your ways.

16:13.600 --> 16:18.000
And you will stay with me tomorrow
and complete all tasks I assign.

16:19.400 --> 16:20.440
Now go.

16:32.120 --> 16:34.200
Sorry. What happened?

16:34.200 --> 16:37.160
Don't worry, I didn't tell on you,
and Alicia.

16:37.160 --> 16:39.800
I've been excluded
from the school trip.

16:39.800 --> 16:41.960
I hope your trick was worth it.

17:06.480 --> 17:09.800
Right. If you've lost your key,
we will have to break your padlock.

17:09.800 --> 17:11.760
After all, you will need your
belongings.

17:11.760 --> 17:13.800
No need, Matron, I found it.

17:19.840 --> 17:23.160
As you can see, all of my things
are in order.

17:25.760 --> 17:26.920
And your hairpin.

17:26.920 --> 17:28.240
I've looked all over.

17:28.240 --> 17:29.600
My mother will be so cross.

17:29.600 --> 17:32.280
I could have sworn
I left it on my table.

17:32.280 --> 17:35.120
Maybe I took it off to go
swimming on Sunday or maybe I...

17:35.120 --> 17:37.960
For goodness' sake, child,
who knows where you lost it?

17:37.960 --> 17:40.000
It will soon turn up.

17:40.000 --> 17:42.720
If not, you've only yourself
to blame.

18:06.000 --> 18:08.560
Lucy, Mam'zelle and Matron found out
about the pellets and now

18:08.560 --> 18:10.920
Sally's missing the trip.
Did she tell them about us?

18:10.920 --> 18:13.200
No, but it's unfair that
she's the one being punished.

18:13.200 --> 18:14.280
We have to tell the truth.

18:14.280 --> 18:16.680
What's the point? We'll just end up
missing the trip too.

18:16.680 --> 18:18.800
Come on, you've always done
the right thing.

18:18.800 --> 18:21.560
It's different this time. I
confessed about the caricature

18:21.560 --> 18:23.120
of Mam'zelle, Matron and Mr Parker.

18:23.120 --> 18:25.080
I can't admit that I was
responsible again.

18:25.080 --> 18:27.000
I'll get into far more trouble
than Sally.

18:27.000 --> 18:29.200
Alicia, if you're my friend,
you'll come with me.

18:29.200 --> 18:31.000
If you're my friend,
you won't force me.

18:31.000 --> 18:32.840
Why are you being so mean?

18:32.840 --> 18:35.000
I'm mean? You're the one
raising your voice.

18:35.000 --> 18:36.440
Because you're being selfish!

18:36.440 --> 18:39.320
Watch your temper, Darrell.
I thought you put that behind you.

18:39.320 --> 18:42.040
That's not fair.
Then stop being such a try-hard.

18:42.040 --> 18:44.640
I don't care.
You're coming with me now.

18:45.800 --> 18:47.960
Stop. What are you doing?

18:47.960 --> 18:51.080
Come with me! Let me go.
What are you doing? Get off her!

18:51.080 --> 18:52.600
Stop!

18:52.600 --> 18:54.600
Alicia, please let go.

18:54.600 --> 18:56.120
Let go of her.

18:56.120 --> 18:58.080
I am not your friend any more,
Alicia.

18:58.080 --> 18:59.560
Not any more. You're a coward.

18:59.560 --> 19:01.320
Please let go. Stop.

19:02.480 --> 19:04.200
What is all this racket?

19:05.840 --> 19:08.240
I believe Darrell started it.

19:08.240 --> 19:10.160
Please, Matron, I can explain.

19:10.160 --> 19:11.840
Save it for Miss Grayling.

19:11.840 --> 19:12.880
You too.

19:25.640 --> 19:29.000
My understanding is it was Darrell
Rivers who started it.

19:29.000 --> 19:31.800
First the sneezing pellets and
now this.

19:31.800 --> 19:35.800
I do not know what has got
into these second formers today.

19:35.800 --> 19:37.480
Why were you fighting?

19:37.480 --> 19:40.360
Such behaviour is neither
appropriate nor acceptable

19:40.360 --> 19:42.840
and is most definitely not
what we expect to see from any girl

19:42.840 --> 19:44.800
at the school.

19:44.800 --> 19:47.800
It was my fault. Matron's right.

19:47.800 --> 19:49.800
It's my fault, not Alicia's.

19:49.800 --> 19:52.640
Darrell, this is not the first
time we've had a discussion

19:52.640 --> 19:55.120
about your temper. Sorry, it was
just she was upset

19:55.120 --> 19:57.400
about Sally missing the trip.

19:57.400 --> 19:59.560
And the trick, it was my idea,

19:59.560 --> 20:03.760
and it's just unfair that Sally's
the one being punished.

20:03.760 --> 20:04.800
I see.

20:06.840 --> 20:09.880
Unfortunately for Sally,
I have to respect Matron

20:09.880 --> 20:11.640
and Mam'zelle Rougier's decision.

20:11.640 --> 20:13.880
But Sally was being a good friend
for covering for me.

20:13.880 --> 20:18.000
Yes, and sadly, your friendship
has cost her this time.

20:18.000 --> 20:22.400
Needless to say, you'll be staying
back tomorrow.

20:22.400 --> 20:27.120
Go back to your dorm and write
an essay about why we do not fight.

20:30.400 --> 20:32.040
Thank you, Miss Grayling.

20:56.000 --> 20:57.560
Here you are.

20:59.320 --> 21:02.680
Sally, I'm so sorry, I tried to tell
Miss Grayling that the trick

21:02.680 --> 21:05.120
was all my fault, but we're both
missing the trip now.

21:05.120 --> 21:06.960
Don't worry, Darrell.
No, it's not fair.

21:06.960 --> 21:11.000
Alicia is the most selfish girl
I have ever met.

21:11.000 --> 21:13.320
Miss Grayling already has
enough worries

21:13.320 --> 21:15.640
and I shouldn't be adding
to the troubles?

21:15.640 --> 21:20.720
I know. What's done is done.

21:20.720 --> 21:23.400
Come on, at least tomorrow
we'll be together.

21:23.400 --> 21:25.920
You're a jolly, decent friend,
Darrell.

21:25.920 --> 21:28.040
Thanks for standing up for me.

21:28.040 --> 21:29.800
Am I?

21:29.800 --> 21:32.680
I know I can be a little bit stern
sometimes,

21:32.680 --> 21:35.440
but I'm just trying to be a good
head of form.

21:35.440 --> 21:37.120
Keep getting it wrong.

21:37.120 --> 21:40.160
Sally, you're the best head of
form and best friend

21:40.160 --> 21:41.800
anyone could ever ask for.

21:47.800 --> 21:50.960
Darrell, do you want to race
to the dorm?

21:53.240 --> 21:56.080
Three. Two. One.

21:58.040 --> 22:01.040
Come on, Darrell! I'm coming!

22:05.280 --> 22:06.520
All right.

22:09.720 --> 22:12.720
Has anyone seen Alicia? Matron
will be here soon for lights out.

22:12.720 --> 22:15.080
No, and it will serve her right
to be late.

22:15.080 --> 22:17.640
Don't be mean. She's still part of
her dorm.

22:17.640 --> 22:20.760
And Alicia misses her family a lot
and she barely gets to see them.

22:20.760 --> 22:23.120
Besides, you all laughed
at the trick.

22:23.120 --> 22:25.080
It's not just about the trick.

22:25.080 --> 22:30.200
Alicia's a beast for letting you and
Darrell take the blame.

22:30.200 --> 22:32.920
Well, I'm sad that you and Darrell
can't come tomorrow,

22:32.920 --> 22:35.600
but don't worry, I'll bring you
back some treats.

22:35.600 --> 22:38.880
And Gwen's buying ices so you'll
have those to look forward to.

22:38.880 --> 22:41.960
I think the ices will have melted
by the time we get back.

22:41.960 --> 22:43.880
Oh, yes.

22:45.880 --> 22:47.920
Oh, I looked at mine. Hi, everyone.

22:50.640 --> 22:53.880
I know you're all cross with me,
but Sally willingly took the blame,

22:53.880 --> 22:57.880
and Darrell did start the fight,
so it's not entirely my fault.

22:57.880 --> 22:59.880
Here, they're choc chip.

23:06.680 --> 23:10.440
Sally? Darrell, you want one?

23:11.960 --> 23:14.200
Darrell? Darrell.

23:20.240 --> 23:22.600
Irene, did you find your pen?

23:22.600 --> 23:24.920
You know, I lost my silver pen, too.

23:24.920 --> 23:28.280
I hope one of you hasn't hidden it.

23:28.280 --> 23:29.320
I...

23:30.440 --> 23:31.880
Please.

23:31.880 --> 23:34.600
I didn't mean for any
of this to happen.

23:34.600 --> 23:36.720
Can we just put it behind us?

23:45.240 --> 23:50.000
Sally, you go. Oh!

24:04.640 --> 24:08.080
ALL: Oh!
