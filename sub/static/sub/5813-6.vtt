WEBVTT

00:03.212 --> 00:05.260
Guess what, Uncle Crowley?
I'm hungry.

00:05.464 --> 00:07.384
So, Amara's growing
like a radioactive weed?

00:07.549 --> 00:08.801
By stuffing her face with souls.

00:08.967 --> 00:11.607
If she's half as powerful
as I think she is, I want her on my team.

00:11.678 --> 00:13.305
The Darkness is almost infinite power.

00:13.597 --> 00:14.877
We're bound, Dean.

00:15.182 --> 00:16.980
God kicked this thing's
ass once before.

00:17.184 --> 00:18.857
We need your help, God.

00:19.394 --> 00:21.567
You know who we need
to help with The Darkness.

00:21.772 --> 00:23.695
Hello, Demon Tablet!

00:23.941 --> 00:26.660
He was God's scribe.
He did hear about everything.

00:26.944 --> 00:29.242
Detective Madsen?
I saw a guy hanging around earlier.

00:29.404 --> 00:30.451
That's Len.

00:30.614 --> 00:31.740
I think Amara sucked out his soul.

00:31.949 --> 00:33.629
I'll confess to all the murders.
Holy crap.

00:33.700 --> 00:34.701
That way I can't get out.

00:34.952 --> 00:36.420
We can't kill him
'cause he hasn't done anything yet.

00:36.620 --> 00:38.964
We don't wanna kill him.
We wanna save people.

00:39.289 --> 00:40.889
Right, your new rules.

00:41.250 --> 00:42.297
What can I do to help?

00:42.459 --> 00:43.927
No, no.
You just, uh, sit there, take a breather.

00:44.169 --> 00:45.466
- Watch some Netflix.
- Okay.

00:45.754 --> 00:47.394
Besides, we got bigger fish to fry.

00:47.464 --> 00:49.967
Bye, Dean. I'll see you soon.

00:56.014 --> 00:58.142
So, she says dating's gonna
break my focus for academics,

00:58.350 --> 01:00.190
but that I'm allowed to date
over summer break.

01:00.727 --> 01:01.819
How does that work?

01:02.229 --> 01:04.697
Like, "Hi, I'm Goldie.
I'm only romantically available

01:04.855 --> 01:06.858
"from June to August,
but wanna go steady?"

01:09.152 --> 01:10.870
I hate her. Like, look at me.

01:11.071 --> 01:13.369
I have to hang out by the tracks
just to get my snack on.

01:13.865 --> 01:15.993
- She won't let you eat chips?
- Well, she'll let me.

01:16.827 --> 01:18.829
But just so she can make this face
the whole time.

01:21.164 --> 01:24.919
It's like, "Sorry, Mom, I can't survive
on menthol and diet soda

01:25.127 --> 01:26.174
"like you can."

01:26.420 --> 01:27.421
Mmm.

01:28.589 --> 01:29.681
What? No.

01:30.007 --> 01:34.478
Look, I hate my parents, too, Goldie.
They suck. But I got a curfew. Bye.

01:35.178 --> 01:37.101
Fine. Bye.

01:40.517 --> 01:41.518
Whoa.

01:42.060 --> 01:43.232
Hey.

01:43.979 --> 01:45.526
Where are your parents?

01:47.941 --> 01:49.409
I don't have any parents.

01:50.485 --> 01:51.577
I'm sorry. Um...

01:52.571 --> 01:54.198
Are you okay? Do you want something?

02:01.121 --> 02:02.714
I want to be like you.

02:35.906 --> 02:37.158
Midnight snack?

02:39.284 --> 02:41.537
Don't think
I don't know what you've been up to.

02:42.079 --> 02:45.083
You can try to deny it,
but the evidence is, well...

02:47.209 --> 02:49.086
You told me
to stop feeding on your demons.

02:49.544 --> 02:52.423
Well... I stopped feeding on demons.

02:52.631 --> 02:53.723
I thought I was clear.

02:53.882 --> 02:57.728
Going out there? Where they can see you?
It's too risky.

02:58.178 --> 03:00.772
I'm a growing girl. I need to eat.

03:01.765 --> 03:05.941
Actions have consequences
around here, Amara.

03:06.436 --> 03:07.779
You've had the run of the Court.

03:07.979 --> 03:09.447
We've seen what you've made of it.

03:10.399 --> 03:15.621
Believe me, this is going to hurt me
way more than it hurts you.

03:16.738 --> 03:17.910
I'm sorry, my dear.

03:19.116 --> 03:20.208
You're grounded.

03:27.082 --> 03:28.459
You're strong...

03:29.126 --> 03:32.630
But you need to remember I'm stronger.

03:34.464 --> 03:35.716
For now.

03:54.109 --> 03:55.736
You said you had a good feeling
about that one.

03:55.902 --> 03:57.702
Yeah, well,
it seemed like a solid lead, Dean.

03:57.821 --> 04:00.324
Only a soulless psycho
would kill the family cat.

04:00.490 --> 04:02.970
Yeah, unless the family cat
decides to take a nap in the dryer.

04:03.410 --> 04:06.755
You know, we've been here since Monday and
still haven't found another legit victim.

04:06.997 --> 04:09.091
Maybe Amara moved on
or stopped feeding altogether.

04:09.875 --> 04:13.675
Well, finding her victims is still the
best shot we got at finding her.

04:13.920 --> 04:15.012
Not actually true.

04:18.257 --> 04:21.098
Oh. What, you think he's ready?
He's had a pretty rough go of it lately.

04:21.261 --> 04:22.513
Which one of us hasn't?

04:23.680 --> 04:27.355
It seems insane to leave our
one and only angel friend on the bench.

04:29.561 --> 04:31.359
- I'll call him.
- Thank you.

04:33.565 --> 04:35.659
We did this time,
but it literally doesn't matter.

04:35.859 --> 04:38.203
Well, we're gonna get
to all the results in just a second.

04:38.445 --> 04:39.697
We 're gonna start with,

04:39.863 --> 04:41.581
let's go back to our first story,

04:42.365 --> 04:44.208
Louis, Sci/la and Edwin.

04:44.451 --> 04:46.499
- Hi.
- Cas, how you doing, buddy?

04:48.705 --> 04:50.002
I'm fine.

04:51.333 --> 04:52.710
Find anything on Metatron?

04:53.335 --> 04:54.803
Nothing on angel radio.

04:56.254 --> 04:58.094
How long has it been
since you left the bunker?

04:58.173 --> 05:00.653
Well, why would I leave?
I've got everything I need right here.

05:01.051 --> 05:02.052
Wait, is th...

05:02.886 --> 05:05.389
- Are you watching Jenny Jones?
- It's a rerun.

05:06.556 --> 05:08.729
She's just about to announce
the paternity results.

05:08.934 --> 05:11.215
You are the father.

05:12.729 --> 05:14.731
Jenny,
he is not ready to be a father.

05:14.898 --> 05:18.243
Okay, I thought you were going with
socially acceptable binge-watching.

05:18.485 --> 05:20.658
You know, The Wire, Game of Thrones.

05:21.154 --> 05:24.374
Yeah, well,
man can't live on caviar alone, Dean.

05:25.909 --> 05:28.537
Well, you sound weird, okay? Bad weird.

05:28.954 --> 05:31.594
- Now, I have been down this road before...
- What's up, Detective?

05:31.706 --> 05:33.583
I have heard the siren song
from the idiot box,

05:33.834 --> 05:35.256
and I'm telling you,
whatever you're looking for,

05:35.418 --> 05:36.590
you won't find it in there.

05:37.254 --> 05:38.506
So, do me a favor.

05:38.755 --> 05:41.053
Turn off the TV,
go outside and get some air.

05:41.925 --> 05:44.405
We're in the dark here, pal.
I need you back in the game, okay?

05:44.928 --> 05:46.180
Yeah, I...

05:47.138 --> 05:48.139
I got it.

05:49.099 --> 05:51.899
Yeah, well, thanks for letting me know.
We'll head out there right now.

05:52.352 --> 05:53.774
- You got it.
- What's up?

05:54.271 --> 05:55.523
That was Detective Madsen.

05:56.898 --> 05:58.070
Remember our friend Len?

05:58.275 --> 06:01.154
Uh. Weird as hell, soulless,
took-the-rap-for-all-the-murders Len?

06:02.362 --> 06:03.955
Yeah. He's dead.

06:28.179 --> 06:29.556
Cass? Cass!

06:30.265 --> 06:31.312
Don't do this.

06:33.518 --> 06:36.772
Okay, this isn't you,
it's the spell. You can beat this!

06:39.316 --> 06:41.318
I will end you!

06:41.735 --> 06:42.827
No!

06:44.821 --> 06:45.822
Don't!

06:50.160 --> 06:52.000
I won't let you
walk out of this room.

07:04.215 --> 07:05.592
Marco got one of them last night.

07:06.092 --> 07:07.184
A Len Fleischer.

07:07.719 --> 07:09.221
Tell Marco to keep looking.

07:09.471 --> 07:12.065
The last thing I need is
one of Amara's candy wrappers

07:12.432 --> 07:17.029
blabbing to angels or hunters
about what, who, happened to them.

07:20.565 --> 07:21.657
Where is everyone?

07:22.192 --> 07:24.069
Oh. Our ranks
have been a bit thin, since...

07:24.444 --> 07:26.287
Amara ate everybody.

07:27.155 --> 07:29.515
I've got some fresh numbers for you
to go over before Court.

07:29.699 --> 07:31.201
Soul projections, they're not good.

07:31.451 --> 07:33.291
We're down for the quarter,
which means that...

07:33.912 --> 07:36.791
That door was supposed to be locked
and guarded 24/7.

07:36.998 --> 07:38.045
Of course, sir.

07:38.750 --> 07:40.548
I don't see a guard.

07:40.794 --> 07:42.216
Uh. Right.

07:42.420 --> 07:46.015
Must be a mix-up.
We're short-staffed and all, so...

07:46.383 --> 07:52.061
Congratulations. You've been demoted.
No one goes in or out of that room.

08:00.814 --> 08:03.567
Thought maybe
a relative of one of Len's victims.

08:04.567 --> 08:06.695
But it doesn't feel like
a revenge killing.

08:08.029 --> 08:09.076
Too clean.

08:09.656 --> 08:11.078
Like an assassination.

08:12.242 --> 08:13.722
- Detective?
- Excuse me.

08:15.036 --> 08:16.253
- You smell that?
- Yeah.

08:16.496 --> 08:18.736
Yeah, either the detective
needs to change his diet or...

08:18.915 --> 08:20.838
Sulfur. Len was killed by a demon.

08:21.084 --> 08:23.507
Yeah, but why would a demon run a hit
on a guy with no soul?

08:23.670 --> 08:25.350
That's like a Cracker Jack
without a prize.

08:25.422 --> 08:26.924
Hands off, Deputy Doody!

08:34.639 --> 08:36.312
- Who's the girl?
- Goldie Schmidtlapp.

08:37.017 --> 08:40.567
Was a normal kid, snapped this morning,
tried to kill her mom with a frying pan.

08:41.938 --> 08:43.986
First the ax murders, then Len, now this?

08:44.149 --> 08:45.589
We're gonna need to talk to the kid.

08:46.192 --> 08:48.866
That's four legs
on four wheels.

08:51.865 --> 08:54.539
Aw. That dog thinks it's people.

08:56.494 --> 08:59.839
Up next,
a very upsetting story out of Omaha.

09:00.123 --> 09:03.548
A downtown bar fight escalated
tragically last night,

09:03.960 --> 09:09.137
and OWW-Two News brings you
an exclusive video of the event.

09:09.799 --> 09:12.723
The footage you are about to view
is extremely graphic.

09:25.565 --> 09:28.865
Efforts were made
to resuscitate the victim but...

09:54.552 --> 09:56.792
Hey, Officer?
Still haven't gotten my phone call.

09:57.055 --> 09:59.055
Do you think I could get
a pizza delivered in here?

10:01.893 --> 10:04.021
- You're not the deputy.
- Nope.

10:10.151 --> 10:12.529
The boss' daughter's
been making a mess in town,

10:12.737 --> 10:14.159
and it's my job to clean it up.

10:15.990 --> 10:17.287
Nothing personal.

10:32.757 --> 10:34.225
Nice work, Goldie.

10:35.718 --> 10:37.391
So, Crowley and Amara.

10:40.515 --> 10:41.516
Huh.

10:48.356 --> 10:49.949
Rise and shine, buttercup.

10:52.193 --> 10:53.240
Now...

10:54.279 --> 10:55.747
About what you were saying...

10:56.614 --> 10:58.412
What's Crowley doing with Amara?

10:59.742 --> 11:03.087
Don't know. Don't care.
Wouldn't tell you if I did.

11:05.081 --> 11:07.584
Well, we already know
she's growing up fast.

11:08.251 --> 11:10.970
Yeah, well, demon souls.
They do a body good.

11:16.426 --> 11:18.269
The little moppet tore through
half my buds

11:18.428 --> 11:20.101
before Crowley put her on a diet.

11:21.347 --> 11:22.564
She didn't like that.

11:23.474 --> 11:26.068
Started sneaking out to get her fill.
You know how kids are.

11:26.811 --> 11:28.233
But Daddy put his foot down.

11:30.857 --> 11:32.734
- Where's he hiding her?
-  Oh.

11:33.359 --> 11:35.782
I'm happy to keep gossiping
with you boys, but...

11:36.196 --> 11:38.540
You want actionable intelligence?

11:40.033 --> 11:41.706
Torture me if you want.

11:43.411 --> 11:44.833
I know you'll just kill me anyway.

11:46.497 --> 11:47.498
Hmm.

11:48.625 --> 11:50.423
Well, looks like a stalemate to me.

11:51.628 --> 11:53.221
I guess we'll go ahead
and kill him right now.

11:53.421 --> 11:54.638
No, no, no. Dean, wait.

11:58.468 --> 12:00.095
We can exorcise him.

12:01.679 --> 12:03.226
- What?
- Save his meatsuit.

12:05.975 --> 12:07.192
My two cents?

12:07.352 --> 12:10.026
You exorcise me,
let me smoke on outta here?

12:10.438 --> 12:12.566
I give you my word not to tell Crowley.

12:14.817 --> 12:17.491
Hey, you heard me.
He's hardly my favorite guy at the moment.

12:17.654 --> 12:19.577
- Wait a second. Shut up.

12:24.702 --> 12:26.500
Well, would you look at that?

12:30.667 --> 12:32.761
There's no way
his suit survived that wound.

12:32.961 --> 12:33.962
Mmm-mmm.

12:35.588 --> 12:36.931
All right.

12:38.841 --> 12:39.933
Crap.

12:56.526 --> 12:57.527
- Hey.
- Hey.

12:57.777 --> 13:00.155
- Where'd you ditch the body?
- School playground.

13:00.697 --> 13:02.370
- Come on.
- Hospital parking lot.

13:03.241 --> 13:05.289
- What do you got?
- Well, good news.

13:05.451 --> 13:07.044
I was able to hack his phone.

13:07.203 --> 13:08.803
Got the coordinates of his call history.

13:09.038 --> 13:11.587
I guess Crowley must have had him
tailing Amara or something,

13:11.791 --> 13:13.111
'cause he was at all three spots.

13:13.126 --> 13:16.300
He was at the Lizzie Borden house,
where Len got his soul taken.

13:16.462 --> 13:18.422
He was at the bar
where Sydney got her soul taken.

13:18.548 --> 13:21.427
And he was here, where Goldie said
Amara approached her.

13:22.135 --> 13:24.388
- Hmm. So, somewhere in there?
- Yeah, maybe.

13:24.971 --> 13:26.811
But what I don't get is,
why would Crowley have

13:26.973 --> 13:28.725
Amara on Earth in the first place?

13:29.392 --> 13:31.392
I mean, wouldn't it be smarter
to keep her in Hell?

13:32.770 --> 13:35.730
Yeah, but then he'd have to spend
more time there, and he hates that place.

13:36.482 --> 13:37.483
On, right.

13:38.484 --> 13:40.737
I keep forgetting about
you and Crowley's summer of love.

13:43.031 --> 13:45.159
I'm not seeing much inside this radius
that he'd like better.

13:45.325 --> 13:47.285
- I mean, you got farms, you got swamps...
- Yeah.

13:47.410 --> 13:49.959
- This P.O.I.? What's that?
- Point of interest.

13:50.288 --> 13:51.756
I know what it... What is it?

13:52.081 --> 13:53.924
- Well, let's find out.
- Yeah.

14:02.759 --> 14:06.104
The Needham Asylum. Decommissioned in '63.

14:07.013 --> 14:08.811
Sound like Crowley's kind of place to you?

14:23.821 --> 14:24.993
What are you looking at?

14:26.824 --> 14:29.293
Still learning all you can
about the world?

14:30.745 --> 14:35.342
If nonsensical slogans attached to
idiotic pictures of domestic animals

14:35.500 --> 14:37.753
- counts as the world.
- Excuse me?

14:39.837 --> 14:41.009
Memes.

14:42.298 --> 14:43.299
Ah.

14:47.845 --> 14:50.769
Look, I know, to you, my rules seem...

14:51.766 --> 14:53.143
Unfair, arbitrary.

14:53.601 --> 14:55.695
As though
I'm doing all this just to hurt you.

14:56.062 --> 14:57.814
I don't care why you do anything.

14:59.690 --> 15:01.818
I just want you to know
that I'm not a monster.

15:05.822 --> 15:07.039
Jervis?

15:12.203 --> 15:15.173
I can't have you eating
whatever, whenever,

15:15.373 --> 15:16.716
however much you want.

15:18.960 --> 15:20.837
I thought you might appreciate
a little snack.

15:23.965 --> 15:26.013
I'm not hungry.

15:42.316 --> 15:43.943
I'll leave you to your memes.

15:56.581 --> 16:00.051
I have no idea what I'm doing here.

16:01.502 --> 16:03.220
Not a bleeding clue.

16:03.838 --> 16:06.933
Moment to moment, what makes you happy,
what will set you off?

16:07.592 --> 16:10.095
How to even begin
to forge a connection with you.

16:10.428 --> 16:12.897
But what I do know is
you're growing so fast.

16:13.764 --> 16:15.232
And it terrifies me.

16:17.059 --> 16:18.185
I bet.

16:20.480 --> 16:22.608
You only want me for the power I'll wield.

16:23.191 --> 16:26.115
And you know, soon enough,
I won't need you anymore.

16:27.862 --> 16:31.082
So, we're really gonna do this? Now?

16:31.574 --> 16:32.621
Hell, yeah.

16:32.825 --> 16:34.372
I've been looking for a chance
to get back at Crowley

16:34.577 --> 16:36.079
ever since that crap he pulled
in Cedar Rapids.

16:36.412 --> 16:38.915
Especially now that I know he tricked me
and made off with The Darkness.

16:39.081 --> 16:40.201
No, that's not what I meant.

16:40.541 --> 16:42.589
We're going in to kill Amara.

16:43.753 --> 16:45.005
Are you ready for that?

16:46.672 --> 16:47.764
Why wouldn't I be?

16:48.299 --> 16:50.427
Because we don't know
the first thing about her, Dean.

16:50.968 --> 16:53.368
We don't know her powers.
We don't know how to take her down.

16:53.387 --> 16:55.230
Hell, you know what?
We don't even know if she can be killed.

16:55.431 --> 16:57.809
I know.
But she's too big of a threat to wait.

16:58.726 --> 17:01.046
I say we go in there
and we hit her with everything we got.

17:11.239 --> 17:13.958
You have tremendous power
and soon, you'll have even more.

17:15.451 --> 17:17.920
But I have something you lack.

17:20.455 --> 17:22.959
Wisdom. Experience.

17:25.044 --> 17:28.013
I helped put Lucifer back in his cage.

17:28.965 --> 17:31.809
I rose through the ranks of Hell,
defeated all comers,

17:32.134 --> 17:33.932
to claim the throne.

17:34.595 --> 17:39.442
And, a few minor setbacks aside,
I'm still here.

17:41.936 --> 17:45.065
I don't know how to impart what
I've learned to you, how to teach you.

17:46.315 --> 17:47.755
And at the rate that you're growing,

17:47.900 --> 17:49.994
I'll probably never get the chance
to figure it out.

17:52.613 --> 17:54.411
Perhaps you don't need my tutelage.

17:57.034 --> 18:00.334
But I believe, deep down in my gut,

18:01.747 --> 18:03.465
I have something to offer you,

18:04.500 --> 18:07.253
if you just give me the chance.

18:16.929 --> 18:18.226
What are you asking for?

18:19.724 --> 18:20.725
Time.

18:21.559 --> 18:22.606
Slow down.

18:23.269 --> 18:27.194
Play by my rules
for just a little bit longer.

18:29.275 --> 18:33.530
You give me your patience,
I'll give you my protection.

18:37.366 --> 18:39.414
Until you decide
you don't need it anymore.

18:47.043 --> 18:48.135
Okay.

18:52.048 --> 18:53.675
Oh. This is good.

18:55.885 --> 18:58.058
A night-leader if ever I saw one.

19:00.848 --> 19:04.569
This is gonna fetch me 500, minimum.

19:11.233 --> 19:12.234
I, uh...

19:12.735 --> 19:18.913
I know 500 sounds like plenty,
but with my overhead?

19:24.288 --> 19:25.585
Daddy's got to eat.

19:28.542 --> 19:30.510
Oh. Come on!

19:31.212 --> 19:33.089
Help. Please.

19:36.300 --> 19:39.429
I'm sorry, buddy.
You live, there's no story.

19:41.889 --> 19:42.890
Ugh...

19:43.516 --> 19:46.360
You know, there was a time...

19:47.561 --> 19:51.441
I could have brought you back
from the brink with a snap of my fingers.

19:53.776 --> 19:55.619
Not that I would have.

20:01.075 --> 20:02.827
But I'm not that guy anymore.

20:05.621 --> 20:06.838
I can't save you.

20:09.083 --> 20:10.300
I can.

20:21.429 --> 20:23.807
- How did you find me?
- Same way you found him.

20:25.266 --> 20:29.112
Scoured the police scanners,
got ahead of the authorities.

20:40.990 --> 20:42.492
What was that?

20:45.786 --> 20:46.912
What?

20:47.413 --> 20:50.087
Look, a real live angel, caught on tape?

20:50.291 --> 20:53.010
That is way better
than some random homicide.

20:53.169 --> 20:54.637
Hey!

20:55.087 --> 20:57.510
Do you have any idea how much stuff

20:57.673 --> 21:01.018
I had to steal
and then pawn to pay for that?

21:13.355 --> 21:14.732
No guards at the perimeter?

21:32.249 --> 21:34.502
Looks like there are no guards
at the door, either.

21:36.587 --> 21:38.305
You think this is the right place, still?

21:40.216 --> 21:41.763
Well, warding sigils.

21:42.551 --> 21:43.803
And for the humans...

21:44.470 --> 21:47.064
Look at this, a padlock you'd find
on a middle-school locker.

21:47.640 --> 21:50.894
- Cocky son of a bitch.
- Dean, external security may be lax,

21:51.101 --> 21:53.621
but we still don't know how many demons
we're gonna face inside.

21:54.647 --> 21:55.944
Well, let's find out.

22:10.704 --> 22:12.877
Turn to the graph at the bottom of 27

22:13.040 --> 22:15.964
and you'll see a nearly
40% decrease in soul collections

22:16.126 --> 22:18.754
in the Pacific Northwest
over the past three years.

22:19.255 --> 22:21.929
An unexpected consequence
of legalized marijuana?

22:22.925 --> 22:24.893
Some analysts think so.

22:25.594 --> 22:28.063
Others are not quite so sure...

22:37.690 --> 22:39.784
Okay, Marv.

22:41.110 --> 22:44.455
You're picking pockets,
leaving a man to die...

22:45.781 --> 22:48.204
I don't know what I expected,
but this is disappointing.

22:48.659 --> 22:49.956
One to talk.

22:51.120 --> 22:53.464
You chose the life of a wage slave,

22:54.373 --> 22:57.001
slinging Slurpees for what? A month?

22:59.336 --> 23:01.430
Lam in it to win it.

23:03.007 --> 23:05.806
I was at zero when you took my grace.

23:06.802 --> 23:10.227
Hiding from angels, not a cent to my name.

23:10.472 --> 23:11.974
But I found my calling.

23:12.474 --> 23:17.355
And I pulled myself up by my bootstraps
and started a business.

23:17.855 --> 23:20.654
And you know,
my story has only just begun.

23:20.900 --> 23:22.117
What story is that?

23:22.943 --> 23:26.117
You're preying like a vulture
on human tragedy.

23:26.322 --> 23:27.699
Oh, jeez.

23:28.240 --> 23:29.742
Castiel.

23:31.577 --> 23:33.830
What century are you in?

23:34.997 --> 23:36.749
Religion is dead!

23:37.207 --> 23:38.834
The novel? Deader.

23:39.960 --> 23:44.431
You think I'm ashamed for dealing in
fleeting visual sensation?

23:45.674 --> 23:50.350
In GIF-length glimpses of horror, waste,
and degradation?

23:50.679 --> 23:51.805
No!

23:53.349 --> 23:55.147
I just caught up with the times!

23:56.977 --> 24:00.982
Reality is the great literature
of our era,

24:01.190 --> 24:06.412
and I am out there, on the streets,
every single night, capturing it.

24:07.404 --> 24:10.749
- I am reality's author...
- Oh. Save your story.

24:10.991 --> 24:12.493
It is not what I came for.

24:16.747 --> 24:17.919
Oh.

24:19.416 --> 24:22.465
So, straight to business.

24:23.963 --> 24:27.217
You want the Demon Tablet?

24:30.469 --> 24:32.221
Well, you're not gonna get it.

24:33.555 --> 24:38.152
I have hidden it very carefully
in a place where you and your friends...

24:38.394 --> 24:41.022
You hid it under your mattress.

24:42.064 --> 24:45.910
The TV station gave me your address
and I checked the place out.

24:46.735 --> 24:48.362
You realize you have bedbugs?

24:49.905 --> 24:53.159
You broke into my apartment?

24:53.909 --> 24:56.958
What do you know about The Darkness?

25:00.916 --> 25:02.008
The band?

25:03.377 --> 25:04.424
Okay.

25:04.962 --> 25:05.963
Uh...

25:06.463 --> 25:08.636
Sometimes, during
late-night writing sessions,

25:09.466 --> 25:11.889
when God was deep in his cups,

25:12.052 --> 25:15.932
he may have let slip a few choice words.

25:21.562 --> 25:23.082
But I don't have to tell you anything.

25:25.941 --> 25:27.568
Are you forgetting?

25:31.572 --> 25:34.951
You are human now.
And I could crush you like a bug.

25:35.951 --> 25:37.123
Could.

25:37.911 --> 25:39.128
But you won't.

25:42.332 --> 25:43.675
You think I didn't notice?

25:44.835 --> 25:46.803
You are broken, Castiel.

25:48.213 --> 25:50.841
You were always a bit of a nancy,
but this?

25:53.594 --> 25:56.393
You have gone full wuss.

25:58.348 --> 26:00.851
I don't know what it was that happened,

26:01.226 --> 26:06.323
but whatever it was, you are scarred deep.

26:07.483 --> 26:11.488
Paralyzed by trauma, by fear.

26:13.655 --> 26:16.033
I mean, look at you.
You can't even hit me.

26:23.665 --> 26:25.167
It's not fear.

26:33.509 --> 26:34.761
Hey, idiot! Andale!

26:35.260 --> 26:37.012
That's Spanish for
"Get your ass over here."

26:40.766 --> 26:42.143
- Do you think I've been paying your...
- Sir?

26:42.392 --> 26:44.486
...astronomical bar tabs
for the past five weeks

26:44.686 --> 26:46.984
so you can sleep past noon
with last night's skank?

26:47.523 --> 26:48.524
Well, Dean...

26:54.196 --> 26:55.322
Is that him?

26:58.283 --> 27:01.207
You know what? Go.

27:02.204 --> 27:04.127
Take her out. I got 'em.

27:21.723 --> 27:23.396
I knew you'd come.

27:32.985 --> 27:34.612
I'm sorry, Amara.

27:35.946 --> 27:37.243
For what?

27:39.491 --> 27:41.164
What I have to do.

27:45.080 --> 27:46.502
Hello, Dean.

27:50.794 --> 27:52.387
My girl is growing up.

27:53.964 --> 27:57.059
Should have known it wouldn't be long
before the boys came sniffing around.

28:05.893 --> 28:07.816
What do you want with her, Crowley?

28:09.605 --> 28:14.532
What do you think, you can use her?
Control her? You're an idiot.

28:15.527 --> 28:17.029
I'm not trying to control her.

28:20.699 --> 28:24.124
I'm helping her
to realize her fullest potential.

28:30.459 --> 28:31.961
Do you know how disturbing it was

28:32.794 --> 28:35.547
to realize
that I couldn't bring myself to kill you?

28:36.673 --> 28:39.142
I've had tons of chances over the years.

28:39.301 --> 28:41.144
Some you don't even know about.
But still...

28:41.929 --> 28:43.431
I made my peace with it.

28:44.181 --> 28:45.808
Embraced my softer side.

28:47.059 --> 28:52.031
Learned to accept that there was just
too much going on between you and I.

28:53.482 --> 28:54.483
Bromance.

28:55.651 --> 28:56.948
But you know what?

28:58.278 --> 28:59.825
I think I am gonna kill you today.

29:00.906 --> 29:02.829
I feel different, somehow.

29:03.992 --> 29:06.791
Ready. What can I say?

29:07.746 --> 29:09.339
Fatherhood changes a man.

29:37.109 --> 29:38.361
The Darkness.

29:38.777 --> 29:40.029
What do you know?

29:41.238 --> 29:42.239
Okay.

29:43.282 --> 29:44.750
So I misjudged.

29:46.201 --> 29:48.203
You're not scared. You're mad.

29:48.620 --> 29:50.588
And I get it.

29:50.831 --> 29:55.007
I mean, it must suck,
being everyone's tool.

29:55.711 --> 29:57.304
Manipulated and used.

29:57.462 --> 30:01.262
By the angels. By your enemies.
By your fr...

30:11.893 --> 30:14.737
You thought
if you could get your grace back,

30:15.230 --> 30:17.358
it would help fix you. But it hasn't.

30:21.528 --> 30:22.871
The Darkness.

30:23.530 --> 30:24.747
Why, Amara?

30:24.990 --> 30:27.288
I thought we had an understanding.

30:27.868 --> 30:30.621
Yeah. Your promise to protect me.

30:31.580 --> 30:34.299
And then, hours later,
I'm assaulted in my own room.

30:35.917 --> 30:38.386
Don't seem terribly upset by it.

30:38.670 --> 30:39.967
That's not the point.

30:40.714 --> 30:43.513
I've decided I don't need your protection.

30:43.717 --> 30:46.220
And I certainly don't need your captivity.

30:48.680 --> 30:49.681
I'm done.

31:10.660 --> 31:12.708
You trying out some kind of
no-kill policy?

31:16.083 --> 31:19.883
Who do you have to thank for
how angry you are? How lost?

31:26.885 --> 31:28.011
You're welcome.

31:42.984 --> 31:46.079
A hunter. You of all people should know.

31:46.405 --> 31:50.126
Pacifism doesn't pay.

32:18.019 --> 32:20.989
Go on, Castiel. End me.

32:42.544 --> 32:43.670
No.

32:49.593 --> 32:51.812
All right. Two out of three.

32:54.806 --> 32:55.898
Dean!

33:01.188 --> 33:02.280
Dean!

33:24.544 --> 33:25.824
It's time.

33:26.004 --> 33:30.555
Time for you to blink your tired ass back
to your throne and lick your wounds.

33:31.051 --> 33:33.645
I'll spare your life on one condition.

33:35.764 --> 33:39.109
Safe passage for Dean, out of here,
after I'm gone.

33:45.148 --> 33:46.240
Yes!

33:52.739 --> 33:53.786
Good.

33:54.866 --> 33:55.867
Now.

33:56.701 --> 33:59.204
Get out of my room.

34:04.125 --> 34:06.344
Oh. Please, Castiel.

34:08.045 --> 34:09.047
Help me.

34:10.549 --> 34:12.141
You said you were happy.

34:12.842 --> 34:14.469
Your bootstraps.

34:17.013 --> 34:18.310
I was faking it.

34:19.808 --> 34:21.150
I mean...

34:21.768 --> 34:23.862
I thought, "How hard could it be?"

34:30.318 --> 34:31.489
You won't.

34:34.239 --> 34:35.331
You can't.

34:35.489 --> 34:36.992
Can't take anymore.

34:37.993 --> 34:40.667
Not a single human day.

34:41.329 --> 34:42.626
I mean...

34:42.956 --> 34:46.755
The indignities, they just don't stop.

34:48.210 --> 34:49.257
They...

34:51.255 --> 34:55.306
Making my rent
and keeping my phone charged.

34:58.555 --> 35:00.307
Hemorrhoids.

35:01.975 --> 35:03.648
You were right, Metatron.

35:05.020 --> 35:06.863
I am sick of having my strings pulled.

35:07.022 --> 35:11.027
Which is why I won't let you manipulate me
into letting you off easy.

35:11.318 --> 35:12.865
on...

35:16.114 --> 35:18.208
Tell me about The Darkness.

35:19.367 --> 35:20.539
Tell me.

35:21.202 --> 35:24.206
What is happening here, between us?

35:27.083 --> 35:28.881
You save me, I save you.

35:34.049 --> 35:35.050
Why?

35:36.885 --> 35:39.684
You were the first thing I saw
when I was freed.

35:39.929 --> 35:42.648
And it had been so long.

35:45.560 --> 35:46.732
Maybe that's it.

35:48.021 --> 35:49.773
My first experience of...

35:50.565 --> 35:52.067
His creation.

35:54.736 --> 35:57.114
You can't help but represent that for me.

35:58.490 --> 36:04.623
The sweet triumph and the
even sweeter folly of what He's wrought.

36:07.916 --> 36:09.384
There's no fighting it.

36:11.086 --> 36:12.508
I'm fascinated.

36:14.089 --> 36:15.261
The truth.

36:16.675 --> 36:19.428
It'd make the Bible-thumpers'
heads explode.

36:21.888 --> 36:24.107
I mean, they want their God to be a...

36:24.683 --> 36:30.156
You know, a finger-snapping,
all-powerful Creator, you know?

36:31.106 --> 36:33.154
They want magic.

36:34.651 --> 36:36.244
' Poppins.

36:39.114 --> 36:40.912
But what he did?

36:44.285 --> 36:45.787
Creation?

36:46.371 --> 36:47.839
That took work.

36:50.083 --> 36:51.426
It took sacrifice.

36:55.004 --> 36:57.382
In order to create the world,

36:58.633 --> 37:02.354
God had to give up
the only thing he'd ever known.

37:05.849 --> 37:10.025
He had to betray and sacrifice

37:10.979 --> 37:12.401
his only kin.

37:16.025 --> 37:17.322
The Darkness.

37:20.947 --> 37:22.073
His sister.

37:27.328 --> 37:29.672
It's been great seeing you again, Dean.

37:30.206 --> 37:31.753
But it's time for me to go.

37:33.251 --> 37:35.970
There's a whole world out there
for me to explore.

37:36.337 --> 37:38.339
And I can practically taste it.

37:41.551 --> 37:45.306
Soon, I'll be strong enough to do
what I came hereto do.

37:46.931 --> 37:48.353
What's that?

37:49.726 --> 37:51.148
Settle an old score.

37:52.854 --> 37:54.026
The oldest score.

38:15.877 --> 38:17.094
Told ya.

38:49.744 --> 38:52.839
Look, Cass. I'm as glad as anyone
that Stella got her groove back, okay?

38:53.039 --> 38:54.757
But you let Metatron go?

38:55.083 --> 38:57.882
Dean. How many times are you going to
repeat that question?

38:58.086 --> 38:59.588
I'm gonna say it again!
You let Metatron go!

38:59.754 --> 39:01.381
He's not going anywhere.

39:01.589 --> 39:03.808
If he makes a move,
if he draws the slightest attention,

39:03.967 --> 39:05.847
the full force of angel-kind
will snuff him out.

39:06.344 --> 39:07.516
Look, you...

39:07.971 --> 39:10.099
Neither of you saw him. He is a human.

39:10.473 --> 39:12.100
And a pitiable one at that.

39:12.433 --> 39:13.776
He's not a threat to us.

39:14.227 --> 39:16.571
Look, I mean, I put him in traction.

39:16.771 --> 39:21.072
Guys, bigger fish to fry, here.
Amara is in the wind.

39:22.819 --> 39:24.412
Yeah, God's freaking sister.

39:25.697 --> 39:29.201
You said you were close, Dean.
How'd she get away?

39:30.326 --> 39:32.166
I'm sorry, what part of
"God's freaking sister"

39:32.203 --> 39:34.672
did you not understand?
She overpowered me. End of story.

39:40.128 --> 39:41.471
What's our plan, here, fellas?

39:41.629 --> 39:44.029
You said you got everything you could
out of Metatron, right?

39:44.549 --> 39:47.149
So, where on Earth are we gonna find
an answer on how to stop her?

39:50.138 --> 39:52.658
I don't suppose God's decided to
share any wisdom on the matter?

39:56.644 --> 39:58.066
I'll look into the lore.

42:20.288 --> 42:21.289
