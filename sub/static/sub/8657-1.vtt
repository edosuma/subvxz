WEBVTT

00:29.328 --> 00:30.762
Stir 'em up.

00:31.831 --> 00:33.365
Watch the tea!

00:33.367 --> 00:35.267
Watch my China!

00:42.141 --> 00:43.775
Four crack.

00:45.945 --> 00:47.379
East.

00:48.948 --> 00:50.382
So who was that
young man you were with

00:50.384 --> 00:53.418
the other day,
quite a studmuffin.

00:53.986 --> 00:56.521
One of my young
lovers of course.

01:02.361 --> 01:03.895
Five bam.

01:04.197 --> 01:07.732
But you have so many,
it's like a revolving door.

01:07.734 --> 01:10.936
You know people are
beginning to talk.

01:10.938 --> 01:14.139
Yes, we are quite
notorious here.

01:14.774 --> 01:16.775
Well if only
that were the case.

01:16.777 --> 01:19.811
Rebecca and I would be
having much more fun here.

01:20.713 --> 01:21.980
Two flower.

01:22.615 --> 01:25.383
Still though, all
those young men.

01:25.385 --> 01:27.385
Keeps you young, doesn't it?

01:33.526 --> 01:35.894
You'll never tell, I know.

01:37.730 --> 01:39.631
Oh, we don't want that from you.

01:59.819 --> 02:02.020
I never saw this coming.

02:05.358 --> 02:07.592
I guess I was confused.

02:11.062 --> 02:13.098
It's all about love, after all.

02:18.205 --> 02:21.940
For 50 years, never
had a babysitter.

02:23.309 --> 02:24.776
It's a caretaker, mom.

02:24.778 --> 02:26.645
She's not here to babysit you.

02:27.213 --> 02:29.848
Listen ma, it's not
even about the stairs.

02:29.850 --> 02:31.383
Do you remember what happened
last time you mixed up

02:31.385 --> 02:35.086
a caretaker can help you
keep 'em all straight.

02:36.022 --> 02:38.790
What was wrong with
Carol, I liked her!

02:39.659 --> 02:41.726
We already talked about this.

02:41.728 --> 02:44.629
She wasn't qualified, and it
really doesn't even matter

02:44.631 --> 02:46.765
if you liked her, we're
not doing this for

02:46.767 --> 02:47.966
a rent-a-friend here.

02:47.968 --> 02:50.001
I guess my choice
means nothing.

02:50.269 --> 02:51.570
No, that's not it, mom.

02:51.572 --> 02:52.837
I just meant...

02:52.839 --> 02:54.205
you know better than
your senile mom, right?

02:54.207 --> 02:55.907
That's not it.

02:56.609 --> 02:59.778
I hire people all the
time, it's what I do.

03:00.580 --> 03:03.048
I just know what I'm
looking for, that's all.

03:03.916 --> 03:05.383
Come on ma.

03:08.187 --> 03:09.721
What time is your flight?

03:09.723 --> 03:10.989
Mom.

03:11.524 --> 03:12.958
Never mind.

03:26.639 --> 03:28.273
Thanks again for coming.

03:28.941 --> 03:31.543
The pleasure is all mine,
it's great to meet both of you.

03:32.745 --> 03:34.846
I understand how
this could be...

03:35.548 --> 03:37.148
Awkward for you.

03:38.718 --> 03:40.218
I'm here to help.

03:40.686 --> 03:42.854
Well I'm glad to
hear that, thank you.

03:43.389 --> 03:46.691
You have a wide
breadth of experiences.

03:46.693 --> 03:48.994
Yes, I guess I'm a collector.

03:48.996 --> 03:50.629
A collector?

03:51.631 --> 03:53.965
Collecting
professions, as it were.

03:55.469 --> 03:56.968
Excuse me, a moment.

04:05.277 --> 04:07.312
Sorry about that, work.

04:07.847 --> 04:08.613
Where were we?

04:08.615 --> 04:10.081
Oh yes, a collector?

04:10.083 --> 04:11.983
Now that's an interesting
way you put that.

04:13.386 --> 04:16.254
Let's see here, you've
worked in health care,

04:16.255 --> 04:19.089
it, entertainment and...

04:19.925 --> 04:22.327
Excuse me, mortuary?

04:23.229 --> 04:24.462
Yes.

04:25.031 --> 04:26.865
I did that in college.

04:31.137 --> 04:33.605
It was interesting,
but not really for me.

04:37.543 --> 04:40.478
So, what brings you to Haley?

04:42.114 --> 04:44.783
I've spent a lot of
time in big cities,

04:44.785 --> 04:47.452
east coast, west coast...

04:48.454 --> 04:50.789
I wanna get out of the rat race.

04:51.457 --> 04:53.324
I just wanna go somewhere...

04:54.593 --> 04:55.960
Simple.

04:57.063 --> 04:58.596
Friendly.

04:58.598 --> 05:00.231
Quiet.

05:01.600 --> 05:04.903
Somewhere I can take
care of someone and...

05:06.405 --> 05:08.173
Figure out my next step.

05:09.442 --> 05:10.775
Do you uh...

05:12.445 --> 05:14.379
Do you have any
questions about the job?

05:16.082 --> 05:18.983
No, I think the job
description was pretty clear.

05:18.985 --> 05:21.052
Similar to other jobs I've had.

05:21.421 --> 05:24.856
Not to interrupt,
I just wanna say,

05:24.858 --> 05:26.925
that although the
job is similar,

05:28.060 --> 05:31.796
being a caregiver is
a huge responsibility,

05:32.598 --> 05:33.965
and it's different
from place to place

05:33.967 --> 05:35.967
and person to person.

05:37.436 --> 05:40.038
I will do my best to
fit into your life

05:40.040 --> 05:41.840
and to make it better.

05:41.842 --> 05:42.874
Well thanks, I'm sure that...

05:42.876 --> 05:44.309
have you ever been married?

05:44.311 --> 05:45.543
Mom!

05:46.579 --> 05:48.046
That, that has...

05:48.048 --> 05:49.214
no.

05:50.015 --> 05:52.383
It is a fair question.

05:52.718 --> 05:54.452
If I'm gonna move in,
she has the right to know

05:54.454 --> 05:57.255
a little bit more about me
than what's on my resume.

05:58.290 --> 05:59.924
I've never been married.

06:00.459 --> 06:02.227
I've been close a few times.

06:04.263 --> 06:06.297
I don't know.

06:08.135 --> 06:10.235
Maybe I'm not the
relationship kind.

06:12.104 --> 06:15.440
Well I'm sure a pretty
woman like yourself

06:15.442 --> 06:18.276
has had her chances.

06:19.912 --> 06:22.080
Thanks, I suppose so.

06:24.250 --> 06:26.985
Things just always
seem to fall apart.

06:30.523 --> 06:31.923
I'm better single, I guess.

06:31.925 --> 06:35.193
Well, I can understand that.

06:44.036 --> 06:45.937
I don't know about her.

06:47.139 --> 06:48.840
What's not to like?

06:49.608 --> 06:52.811
She's got, she's got experience.

06:52.813 --> 06:54.946
A great background,
good references.

06:55.347 --> 06:56.748
I don't know.

06:56.750 --> 06:59.584
She just seems too good.

07:00.920 --> 07:02.387
Are you kidding me?

07:02.389 --> 07:04.355
You don't want her here
'cause she's too right

07:04.357 --> 07:05.790
for the job?

07:07.827 --> 07:09.327
I don't believe this.

07:11.397 --> 07:13.565
You know, mom, it
doesn't even matter.

07:13.567 --> 07:16.067
I offered her the
job, she accepted.

07:16.069 --> 07:19.337
We signed an agreement,
you do remember that right?

07:19.339 --> 07:21.673
It was your
agreement, not mine.

07:22.508 --> 07:25.510
Dammit, I'm just
trying to help.

07:25.512 --> 07:27.879
You can't live here alone.

07:27.881 --> 07:29.047
So you say!

07:29.049 --> 07:30.281
You're damn right!

07:34.754 --> 07:37.488
Look, you need help
and now you've got it.

07:38.557 --> 07:40.491
Case closed.

07:50.402 --> 07:51.369
I gotta go.

07:51.371 --> 07:52.604
You always do.

07:52.606 --> 07:54.973
I will call you
next week, okay?

07:58.110 --> 08:00.845
Everything will be
great, I promise.

08:18.264 --> 08:20.431
This is some
house you have here.

08:24.270 --> 08:25.770
How long have you lived here?

08:26.305 --> 08:27.872
53 years.

08:28.240 --> 08:29.574
Wow.

08:38.784 --> 08:40.284
You don't see people
set down roots like that

08:40.287 --> 08:41.818
much anymore.

08:44.356 --> 08:46.724
Why did you move to
Haley in the first place?

08:47.326 --> 08:49.227
My husband was a doctor.

09:05.644 --> 09:07.578
You don't really
want me here, right?

09:08.881 --> 09:11.516
It's nothing
personal, I just...

09:11.518 --> 09:13.384
don't think you need help?

09:15.321 --> 09:16.721
Maybe you don't.

09:17.189 --> 09:19.490
And maybe your son
pushed you into this?

09:19.492 --> 09:21.392
No, I didn't say that, I...

09:21.394 --> 09:22.694
I know.

09:23.996 --> 09:25.563
But I have eyes.

09:27.466 --> 09:30.668
Listen, I really am here
to make your life better.

09:31.136 --> 09:32.170
Really.

09:40.079 --> 09:41.813
How about the nickel tour?

09:55.361 --> 09:57.028
Is that your husband?

09:58.397 --> 10:00.698
Yes, doctor passed away

10:00.700 --> 10:02.967
12 years ago this month.

10:03.936 --> 10:05.336
I'm sorry.

10:05.738 --> 10:08.806
Part of life, death
comes to us all.

10:09.641 --> 10:10.942
Next stop.

10:14.546 --> 10:16.414
This will be yours.

10:17.016 --> 10:18.750
Thank you, it's very nice.

10:20.919 --> 10:22.687
Did you stuff those yourself?

10:22.689 --> 10:25.590
Oh no, it was a family friend.

10:26.258 --> 10:28.092
Kind of ghastly, actually.

10:29.628 --> 10:30.962
I don't know.

10:32.798 --> 10:34.665
I rather like them.

10:35.901 --> 10:39.303
Pretty, well-preserved.

10:48.247 --> 10:51.082
Oh, you don't need to
go down those stairs.

10:51.316 --> 10:53.751
No need to take
unnecessary chances.

10:54.653 --> 10:57.088
I'm fine, it's no problem.

10:58.190 --> 11:01.692
Did you know that trips
and falls are statistically

11:01.694 --> 11:04.095
the most common injuries
among the elderly?

11:06.899 --> 11:08.733
I can take a quick
look around myself.

11:10.069 --> 11:11.702
Really, I'm fine.

11:11.704 --> 11:13.938
And I insist.

11:15.908 --> 11:17.241
What's down there?

11:17.243 --> 11:19.243
Well, okay.

11:20.112 --> 11:22.880
There's a doctor's old office.

11:23.348 --> 11:25.049
Another bedroom.

11:26.018 --> 11:29.487
Now let's see uhm, a workshop.

11:29.489 --> 11:31.989
Storage, oh and
the new basement.

11:34.394 --> 11:35.493
New?

11:35.495 --> 11:37.762
Oh, of course new is relative.

11:37.764 --> 11:40.331
We added it on the
house years ago.

11:45.637 --> 11:47.738
I guess I'll make some tea.

11:48.273 --> 11:49.841
Would you like some?

11:50.409 --> 11:53.478
A lovely idea, please.

11:54.713 --> 11:56.114
I'll be right back.

13:12.257 --> 13:13.624
Perfect.

13:28.907 --> 13:30.141
Thanks.

13:30.143 --> 13:31.576
You're welcome.

13:31.910 --> 13:34.145
A very spacious
basement you have.

13:34.647 --> 13:38.482
Hmm, haven't done
a lot with it lately.

13:40.285 --> 13:41.786
Listen.

13:42.087 --> 13:44.255
I know you're not comfortable
with me being here.

13:46.625 --> 13:47.758
Yet.

13:48.760 --> 13:50.261
But you will be.

13:54.333 --> 13:56.067
We'll make a great team.

13:58.737 --> 13:59.537
You'll see.

14:22.861 --> 14:25.997
Oh, you're up, sleepyhead!

14:36.074 --> 14:37.441
Going for the caffeine, eh?

14:37.443 --> 14:40.611
We're gonna have
to switch to decaf,

14:40.613 --> 14:41.612
it's better for you.

14:41.614 --> 14:44.215
And I just about
have breakfast ready,

14:44.217 --> 14:45.716
you'll love it.

14:46.518 --> 14:49.520
My famous oatmeal.

14:50.055 --> 14:51.555
Very heart-healthy.

14:52.391 --> 14:54.191
We wanna take good
care of you, right?

14:55.027 --> 14:56.694
I prefer bacon.

14:57.596 --> 14:59.297
Hmm, nah-ah.

15:06.338 --> 15:08.072
So, how do you like it?

15:09.775 --> 15:13.411
It's good, thanks.

15:13.413 --> 15:15.646
And it's high in anti-oxidants,

15:15.648 --> 15:18.816
fiber and flavonoids,
and low on cholesterol,

15:18.818 --> 15:21.052
and trans-fatty acids.

15:23.121 --> 15:24.555
Great.

15:31.263 --> 15:33.264
Have you heard
from your son lately?

15:33.732 --> 15:36.133
No, he hardly ever calls.

15:36.835 --> 15:38.235
Now that you're here
he doesn't have to

15:38.237 --> 15:40.104
even pretend he cares.

15:41.039 --> 15:43.107
Oh, that can't be right.

15:44.943 --> 15:47.611
He seemed like
such a caring man.

15:48.180 --> 15:51.215
Hmm, caring for
his checkbook maybe.

15:53.519 --> 15:55.119
I'm sorry you think that.

15:57.022 --> 16:00.024
He told me he loves
you very much.

16:01.993 --> 16:03.594
He told you that?

16:03.895 --> 16:05.196
Hmmmm.

16:05.198 --> 16:09.633
Yes, it was very sweet.

16:15.674 --> 16:17.875
You know, I'm thinking
I'll move downstairs.

16:17.877 --> 16:19.276
Oh well, I think...

16:19.278 --> 16:22.446
perfect, I'll take my
stuff down after breakfast.

16:26.017 --> 16:27.918
It'll be just like home.

16:30.288 --> 16:32.390
You in the upstairs.

16:34.159 --> 16:36.527
Me in the downstairs.

16:40.766 --> 16:42.299
Yeah...

17:34.719 --> 17:36.153
What are you looking for?

17:36.155 --> 17:39.023
Oh, I'm getting so
forgetful nowadays.

17:39.025 --> 17:42.059
I could've sworn I had my
Oprah magazine right here.

17:42.061 --> 17:43.461
Oh, it's not you,
I took your magazine

17:43.463 --> 17:44.795
to read in bed.

17:44.797 --> 17:45.863
I'll go get it.

17:45.865 --> 17:47.565
Oh, thank you dear.

17:58.577 --> 18:00.244
Coming right up.

18:05.717 --> 18:09.153
You have some nice friends, fun.

18:09.688 --> 18:12.890
They're good folks, I've
known 'em a long time.

18:14.359 --> 18:16.494
But new friends are good too.

18:20.565 --> 18:22.600
You know, I was thinking...

18:24.769 --> 18:26.203
What dear?

18:29.541 --> 18:31.675
Not really sure
how to say this...

18:32.143 --> 18:35.446
Well, just say it,
what could be so bad?

18:36.648 --> 18:38.349
Well, it's just you're
so good with people

18:38.351 --> 18:40.551
and we have so much space here.

18:44.322 --> 18:46.357
Have you heard of myfreebed.Com?

18:46.359 --> 18:49.393
Oh, I don't use the
web portal very much.

18:49.395 --> 18:51.395
Well, it's a great
site, people sign up

18:51.397 --> 18:53.163
to meet new people,
traveling through,

18:53.165 --> 18:54.598
to let them use their homes.

18:54.600 --> 18:56.166
Is that safe?

18:56.601 --> 18:59.870
Sure, people that about
themselves on the site,

18:59.872 --> 19:02.573
and others who they have already
stayed with vouch for them.

19:02.575 --> 19:05.543
I've used them both, both
offering places to stay

19:05.545 --> 19:07.111
and staying with people.

19:08.046 --> 19:10.614
It's a really neat experience.

19:11.650 --> 19:13.217
And safe.

19:14.553 --> 19:17.521
Come to think of it, we
did something like that

19:17.523 --> 19:21.592
during the war, only it was
soldiers passing through.

19:21.594 --> 19:23.727
Of course we didn't
have the web.

19:24.229 --> 19:25.596
We barely had running water.

19:28.066 --> 19:29.533
So what do you think?

19:29.535 --> 19:31.602
It's a great way
to meet new people.

19:32.203 --> 19:34.872
Ah, I don't know.

19:34.874 --> 19:37.875
Don't worry, it will
always be just one at a time.

19:37.877 --> 19:39.910
Come on, it'll be fun.

19:40.245 --> 19:41.745
The visitor will
stay in the basement,

19:41.747 --> 19:42.746
so they'll be out of your hair

19:42.748 --> 19:44.481
and I'll take care of all of it.

19:46.351 --> 19:49.453
Come on, live a little.

19:52.057 --> 19:54.158
Maybe I should ask my son.

19:54.926 --> 19:56.226
Your son?

19:59.164 --> 20:00.531
This is your house.

20:06.638 --> 20:07.972
Okay.

20:07.974 --> 20:09.740
How does this work?

20:14.245 --> 20:17.047
Okay, so this is a
listing of all the members.

20:17.049 --> 20:19.216
You have to be a member
to request a bed.

20:19.218 --> 20:22.219
And we have to make a
profile to offer a bed.

20:22.587 --> 20:23.387
Ready?

20:23.389 --> 20:24.722
Sure.

20:24.856 --> 20:27.257
Okay, so first we
have to take a picture.

20:27.259 --> 20:28.392
Oh...

20:29.094 --> 20:30.661
Don't worry, you look great.

20:30.663 --> 20:31.729
You look great!

20:31.731 --> 20:33.697
All right, let's
squish together.

20:33.699 --> 20:34.531
All right.

20:34.533 --> 20:35.466
Great, here it goes.

20:35.468 --> 20:37.534
Three, two, one!

20:39.771 --> 20:41.705
Oh, nice.

20:42.107 --> 20:43.374
Now what?

20:43.376 --> 20:45.275
Okay, I just need
to finish the profile

20:45.277 --> 20:48.012
and we wait for someone
who wants to stay here.

20:48.014 --> 20:49.380
In Haley?

20:50.348 --> 20:51.482
You'd be surprised.

21:12.871 --> 21:14.405
Done.

21:22.180 --> 21:24.248
In the city,
and I had a hard night

21:24.250 --> 21:25.949
with some Singapore slings.

21:27.153 --> 21:28.052
And the waitress
who served them.

21:28.054 --> 21:29.486
Good lord, what's wrong?

21:29.488 --> 21:30.788
I'm not feeling
too much like business.

21:30.790 --> 21:34.391
It's just one
knock on the office door.

21:34.393 --> 21:36.460
I just got my name on it.

21:36.462 --> 21:37.895
We have one on myfreebed.

21:40.665 --> 21:42.533
Someone who wants to visit.

21:43.468 --> 21:46.070
Really, oh?

21:46.538 --> 21:47.705
Look.

21:51.242 --> 21:52.843
Okay, look.

21:52.845 --> 21:56.113
His name is Bob rusk, let's see.

21:56.115 --> 21:58.916
25 from des moines, on
his way to California,

21:58.918 --> 22:01.185
wants to stay on the 14th.

22:01.920 --> 22:03.887
Wow, that's three days from now.

22:05.490 --> 22:06.924
What'cha think?

22:07.592 --> 22:09.059
It'll be fun.

22:11.262 --> 22:13.764
Yay, I'll let him know.

22:19.537 --> 22:22.539
So Bob, why are you
going to California?

22:23.108 --> 22:25.709
Well, my uncle has got a
fruit business out there,

22:25.711 --> 22:27.811
so I figured, I'd go
out there, you know,

22:27.813 --> 22:29.213
help him out a little bit.

22:29.681 --> 22:31.081
Enjoy the awesome
weather for a change,

22:31.083 --> 22:33.617
and who knows, maybe
even try my hand

22:33.619 --> 22:35.152
at being an actor.

22:35.154 --> 22:37.154
Well that sounds wonderful.

22:37.156 --> 22:40.691
I remember when I went to
California, it was lovely.

22:40.693 --> 22:42.159
Oh really?

22:42.161 --> 22:43.560
When was that?

22:43.562 --> 22:47.297
Oh, years ago, you
probably weren't even born.

22:49.300 --> 22:51.568
You know, I can't
thank you ladies enough

22:51.570 --> 22:52.803
for letting me
stay here, I mean,

22:52.805 --> 22:54.271
it's making a huge difference

22:54.273 --> 22:56.673
in my very, very small budget.

22:58.276 --> 22:59.710
Well good.

23:01.446 --> 23:02.913
It's our pleasure.

23:03.648 --> 23:05.215
May I show you to your room?

23:05.884 --> 23:07.050
Sure.

23:08.920 --> 23:09.987
Excuse me ma'am.

23:09.989 --> 23:11.655
Off course.

23:18.163 --> 23:20.664
Like I was saying, the
weather in the winter,

23:20.666 --> 23:23.267
back when I was young,
was much colder.

23:23.269 --> 23:25.002
Loads, yes.

23:25.004 --> 23:28.605
I remember back in
'64, now that was cold.

23:28.607 --> 23:29.373
It was so cold.

23:29.375 --> 23:30.507
Hmmmm.

23:30.509 --> 23:31.975
That pigs were
freezing in their slop.

23:31.977 --> 23:34.878
Oh, what
a mess that was to clean up.

23:34.880 --> 23:37.447
Nothing, just in Haley
doing this myfreebed thing.

23:37.449 --> 23:40.851
And I'm not sure about this
whole global warming stuff,

23:40.853 --> 23:42.586
you know, back when
I was a girl...

23:42.588 --> 23:44.421
As soon as I can, trust me.

23:56.734 --> 23:58.202
Can I get you
something to drink?

23:58.204 --> 24:00.904
No, I'm just sitting
around, you know,

24:00.906 --> 24:03.040
doing nothing, like the usual.

25:02.334 --> 25:04.334
Ssshht, ssshht.

25:04.836 --> 25:07.738
It doesn't take long,
it doesn't take long.

25:32.230 --> 25:33.664
Strong one.

25:37.835 --> 25:40.003
I gotta go but
I'll be right back.

25:44.275 --> 25:46.076
So much to do.

25:47.745 --> 25:49.279
So little time.

27:17.702 --> 27:19.369
Hey there.

27:19.737 --> 27:22.539
Not like you to stay in so late.

27:22.541 --> 27:25.208
Hmm, didn't sleep well.

27:26.411 --> 27:28.879
Our young friend
is sleeping late too.

27:30.214 --> 27:33.350
No, he left early this morning.

27:33.352 --> 27:35.685
Said he had to
catch the early bus.

27:35.687 --> 27:40.090
Oh, what a shame,
nice young man.

27:44.328 --> 27:45.929
Any new requests?

27:47.098 --> 27:48.432
Nope.

27:49.033 --> 27:50.834
Everything at its time.

27:59.444 --> 28:00.710
Yes?

28:00.712 --> 28:02.979
I just wanted to tell you...

28:04.749 --> 28:06.817
It's been nice having you here.

28:07.985 --> 28:10.153
It just took some
getting used to.

28:11.055 --> 28:12.689
That's understandable.

28:14.158 --> 28:15.692
Change can be difficult.

28:15.694 --> 28:19.162
Exactly, thanks
for understanding.

28:21.799 --> 28:24.034
I wanted to talk to you
about your eternal salvation.

28:24.036 --> 28:24.801
Excellent!

28:24.803 --> 28:27.170
Pick up my son from
my mom and dad's house,

28:27.172 --> 28:29.039
and this really saves on hotels.

28:29.041 --> 28:31.341
And then you're
out of here at dawn?

28:34.745 --> 28:35.679
I'm sorry.

28:35.681 --> 28:37.314
Uhm yeah, uh, tomorrow morning.

28:37.316 --> 28:38.915
Tomorrow morning.

28:38.917 --> 28:40.383
That is so neat.

28:40.385 --> 28:42.352
I always thought being a
vet would be fascinating.

28:42.354 --> 28:45.622
It is, I'm blessed to be
where I'm at in my life.

28:46.257 --> 28:47.924
I know the feeling.

28:48.326 --> 28:51.428
So, how did you get
started in this line of work?

28:51.430 --> 28:53.997
Well, it was actually when
I was just a little girl.

28:53.999 --> 28:56.099
I was outside playing,
when I heard the sound

28:56.101 --> 28:58.702
of brakes screeching
in the street.

28:58.704 --> 29:01.671
When I got there, I found
that someone had hit a dog

29:01.673 --> 29:04.908
and then just drove
away and left it.

29:04.910 --> 29:06.343
Horrible!

29:06.345 --> 29:08.145
How could someone
do such a thing?

29:08.147 --> 29:10.313
I have no idea.

29:10.781 --> 29:13.750
Anyway, I picked it up
and carried it home.

29:13.752 --> 29:16.219
My mom and I took it to the vet,

29:16.221 --> 29:18.255
and then I took care of it.

29:18.923 --> 29:20.991
You nursed it back to life?

29:22.527 --> 29:24.995
What a wonderful story.

29:26.397 --> 29:28.465
I had a dog when
I was a little girl.

29:30.368 --> 29:32.169
We should get a dog.

29:32.803 --> 29:33.970
A dog?

29:33.972 --> 29:37.574
Oh dear no, they
require a lot of care.

29:44.416 --> 29:46.016
What do you think?

29:46.918 --> 29:48.652
Did you hear what I said?

29:50.955 --> 29:53.657
You went to the dogs
there for a moment.

29:54.926 --> 29:56.326
Yes.

29:57.461 --> 29:59.763
They require a lot of care.

31:05.062 --> 31:07.464
And you seemed like
such a nice lady.

31:11.068 --> 31:13.737
I really liked your dog story.

31:30.222 --> 31:34.357
Feel and
breathe, that is the key.

31:34.959 --> 31:36.660
Now open your eyes.

31:38.529 --> 31:40.096
And how do you feel?

31:41.299 --> 31:43.166
Very good, I feel good.

31:43.168 --> 31:46.202
Say now, look behind you.

31:48.339 --> 31:50.307
Looks like we
might have visitors.

31:50.309 --> 31:51.708
Wonderful.

31:52.109 --> 31:53.943
What else do you see?

31:58.582 --> 32:00.517
When did
you say they would be here?

32:01.585 --> 32:03.353
15 minutes ago.

32:04.588 --> 32:06.089
You're as nervous
as a long-tailed cat

32:06.091 --> 32:09.693
in a room full of
rocking chairs.

32:13.465 --> 32:15.165
Oh, that must be them.

32:15.499 --> 32:17.100
What were their names again?

32:17.535 --> 32:19.269
Ted and Linda steiner.

32:19.870 --> 32:21.304
Come on in, have a seat.

32:21.306 --> 32:22.038
Thank you.

32:22.040 --> 32:23.473
Hmmmmm.

32:29.313 --> 32:32.148
So, what brings you to Haley?

32:32.950 --> 32:35.552
Well, we're kinda
in transition.

32:35.554 --> 32:37.721
So we decided to travel a bit.

32:38.622 --> 32:41.224
What he means is,
I'm in-between jobs.

32:41.226 --> 32:43.626
And since he can
work from anywhere,

32:43.628 --> 32:45.595
we have some flexibility.

32:45.597 --> 32:46.863
Oh, and what kind of job...

32:46.865 --> 32:48.865
what do you do?

32:49.667 --> 32:52.402
Are you some sort of consultant?

32:54.572 --> 32:57.273
Uh yeah, I guess you
could call me that.

32:58.909 --> 33:00.377
I work in it.

33:00.379 --> 33:02.412
Managing company's networks.

33:04.348 --> 33:05.915
Boring tech stuff.

33:06.350 --> 33:07.617
No, not all.

33:07.619 --> 33:09.719
I worked in it before.

33:10.855 --> 33:12.422
Fascinating.

33:13.758 --> 33:16.659
To answer your question,
I worked in a nonprofit,

33:16.661 --> 33:18.261
advocating literacy.

33:18.263 --> 33:21.030
Now that sounds
like a rewarding job.

33:22.099 --> 33:26.403
Well rather, worked,
I got downsized.

33:26.771 --> 33:28.171
Oh...

33:29.073 --> 33:31.007
So, here we are.

33:31.442 --> 33:34.177
Put our life in storage
and left the big city.

33:34.845 --> 33:38.548
To Haley, and beyond I suppose.

33:39.884 --> 33:42.185
Meanwhile I'm still
looking for a job,

33:42.187 --> 33:43.319
I'm sending out resumes,

33:43.321 --> 33:45.054
making phone calls.

33:45.056 --> 33:48.191
Amazing what you can
do with the Internet now.

33:49.693 --> 33:51.127
Indeed.

33:52.963 --> 33:54.998
It's all about
bringing people together.

34:14.618 --> 34:18.021
So we normally don't have
couples stay with us.

34:18.023 --> 34:19.956
But your picture was so nice.

34:19.958 --> 34:22.225
Yes, I do have
experience in that area.

34:22.226 --> 34:24.194
We thought, why not try?

34:24.196 --> 34:27.263
Yes, that'd be fantastic,
thank you for calling.

34:27.264 --> 34:29.933
All right, that's exactly
what I've been looking for.

34:29.935 --> 34:31.301
Why not?

34:32.303 --> 34:34.838
Great, yes, I would love to.

34:46.817 --> 34:49.152
Guess we need a lost and found.

35:05.236 --> 35:06.703
Bad habit?

35:07.338 --> 35:09.005
The worst.

35:16.981 --> 35:18.915
So if you need anything,

35:19.483 --> 35:21.384
I'm in the room down the hall.

35:22.453 --> 35:23.887
Will do.

36:16.740 --> 36:18.141
Excuse me.

36:18.143 --> 36:20.410
I guess I wasn't
paying attention.

36:20.412 --> 36:22.245
I should've seen you coming.

36:22.980 --> 36:24.447
Distracted?

36:26.350 --> 36:27.984
I guess you could say that.

36:28.953 --> 36:30.687
And your wife?

36:31.822 --> 36:33.923
She finally fell asleep.

36:36.327 --> 36:38.428
Finished her phone calls?

36:49.974 --> 36:51.341
No...

36:53.344 --> 36:55.345
Not now.

36:58.415 --> 37:00.750
Your wife is a problem.

37:04.221 --> 37:05.888
Tomorrow?

37:36.620 --> 37:40.123
Wow, this is tasty, what
do you call this again?

37:40.125 --> 37:42.792
Scrapple, an old family recipe.

37:43.427 --> 37:45.728
What'cha think
hon, good stuff huh?

37:46.430 --> 37:47.730
Yeah.

37:51.902 --> 37:53.736
She's not much of
a morning person.

37:53.738 --> 37:56.372
Neither am I, I
made this last night.

37:58.709 --> 38:00.843
So, what are your plans?

38:02.179 --> 38:05.048
Well, I've been
thinking about that.

38:05.050 --> 38:06.783
I think we should
stay another day.

38:06.785 --> 38:09.919
What, why would we stay here?

38:12.089 --> 38:15.491
I mean it's nice here and
all, but, we have plans,

38:15.493 --> 38:16.893
right?

38:17.895 --> 38:19.262
Well as always you're right,

38:19.264 --> 38:21.831
but you do have a lot of
e-mails to catch up on.

38:21.833 --> 38:23.833
And the signal is good here.

38:24.268 --> 38:26.803
So, spend the day, relax.

38:27.237 --> 38:28.738
Take care of business.

38:28.740 --> 38:32.041
Okay, one night, that's it.

38:34.812 --> 38:37.747
Okay, that should
be all we need.

39:04.041 --> 39:07.777
Well, that's it for me.

39:07.779 --> 39:10.213
Time for my long winter's nap.

39:11.782 --> 39:13.382
Nighty night, folks.

39:20.691 --> 39:22.358
Oh thank god.

39:23.127 --> 39:25.428
I thought that show
would never end.

39:26.330 --> 39:29.265
All about murder and CSI.

39:30.801 --> 39:32.568
I'm probably gonna
have nightmares.

39:32.570 --> 39:34.370
Oh honey.

39:37.574 --> 39:39.041
I can fix that.

39:41.545 --> 39:42.345
Fix what?

39:42.347 --> 39:44.013
Your nightmares.

39:46.016 --> 39:48.017
I have a surprise for you.

39:50.220 --> 39:51.487
What?

39:52.055 --> 39:55.057
Meet me downstairs, 15 minutes.

40:12.843 --> 40:13.543
Oh, there you are.

40:13.545 --> 40:14.777
It's about time.

40:16.613 --> 40:17.814
Movie night.

40:18.382 --> 40:20.082
You're kidding right?

40:20.384 --> 40:22.285
Someone else's home movies?

40:22.287 --> 40:23.586
This is your big surprise?

40:23.588 --> 40:24.954
Come on, it will be great,

40:24.956 --> 40:27.190
we'll watch perfect
strangers, you love that.

40:27.192 --> 40:30.359
Strange maybe,
perfect, doubtful.

40:31.061 --> 40:33.462
There you go, have a seat.

40:33.931 --> 40:36.732
Okay, but if I fall
asleep, don't let me drool.

40:37.201 --> 40:38.868
Perish the thought.

42:14.698 --> 42:19.302
We were in
love, it was beautiful.

43:47.290 --> 43:50.059
So, how are you
settling in downstairs?

43:51.728 --> 43:53.696
Quite well, thanks.

43:54.398 --> 43:56.599
I'm in the guest room, but
if we have any free bedders,

43:56.601 --> 43:59.402
I just move the air mattress
into the living room.

44:00.637 --> 44:02.204
Hmm.

44:05.675 --> 44:08.210
And I wanna thank you
again for having me here.

44:08.879 --> 44:10.846
I think it's gonna be
a good place for me.

44:13.250 --> 44:15.317
Too bad about your wife.

44:17.988 --> 44:20.856
Yeah, that was tough.

44:22.759 --> 44:25.061
But we've been growing
apart for years.

44:26.063 --> 44:27.797
I should've seen it coming.

44:29.833 --> 44:32.935
Hmm, so many people
split up nowadays,

44:32.937 --> 44:35.237
I just don't understand it.

44:37.974 --> 44:39.875
What have you heard from her?

44:41.711 --> 44:44.246
Let's see, where do
you want her to be?

44:47.517 --> 44:49.752
Last I saw on
Facebook she was in L.A.

44:52.055 --> 44:53.489
Does she know anyone there?

44:53.491 --> 44:54.490
No.

44:54.991 --> 44:56.625
She's never been there.

44:56.627 --> 44:58.794
East coaster all her life.

45:00.697 --> 45:02.631
That's a good place for her.

45:02.633 --> 45:04.433
Fresh start.

45:07.471 --> 45:08.504
Good cell service.

45:23.487 --> 45:25.020
What's next?

45:25.255 --> 45:27.656
We post some stock pictures
from L.A., Hollywood,

45:27.658 --> 45:29.892
whatever, every once in a while.

45:29.894 --> 45:32.428
Post some generic
status messages.

45:32.430 --> 45:33.829
"Looking for a new place!"

45:33.831 --> 45:35.331
"Oh, great restaurant!"

45:35.333 --> 45:36.999
That kinda stuff.

45:39.136 --> 45:40.736
How long do we have to do that?

45:40.738 --> 45:41.971
Not too long.

45:41.973 --> 45:44.140
People don't pay
that much attention.

45:47.511 --> 45:49.645
She worked in nonprofits right?

45:50.514 --> 45:51.747
Yeah.

45:52.082 --> 45:53.682
Oh, perfect.

45:54.951 --> 45:57.553
She'll get a do-gooder
job overseas.

45:57.555 --> 46:01.457
Will fall off the grid,
won't have time for friends.

46:02.058 --> 46:03.859
That happens all the time.

46:06.530 --> 46:08.030
And that's that!

46:11.401 --> 46:14.136
You are a genius.

46:14.804 --> 46:17.339
You inspire me.

46:29.453 --> 46:31.654
Granny didn't say a word.

46:31.656 --> 46:35.024
I made Rebecca happy, and
that was enough for her.

46:36.159 --> 46:37.459
At first.

46:47.705 --> 46:49.205
Is Becca here?

46:49.906 --> 46:51.273
Shopping.

46:54.044 --> 46:57.346
Uhm, I usually watch
the news right now.

46:58.715 --> 46:59.715
Really?

46:59.717 --> 47:01.116
I like Seinfeld.

47:02.686 --> 47:04.853
Guess we'll just
have to take turns.

47:09.426 --> 47:11.227
Am I in your chair?

47:12.829 --> 47:14.396
Oh, sorry about that.

47:14.931 --> 47:16.465
I'll be done in a jiffy.

47:33.384 --> 47:35.818
Ri, r-i?

47:35.820 --> 47:38.020
Yep, look it up.

47:39.155 --> 47:40.623
What the hell does that mean?

47:40.625 --> 47:42.324
Are you challenging?

47:49.766 --> 47:51.233
Never mind.

47:51.235 --> 47:53.969
Ah, my turn.

47:56.439 --> 47:58.440
S-I-i-t.

47:59.109 --> 48:01.343
Slit, I guess we
know that means huh?

48:07.384 --> 48:09.518
Any new bed requests?

48:09.819 --> 48:11.387
Not yet.

48:12.989 --> 48:15.691
Hmm, too bad.

48:16.660 --> 48:17.826
Indeed.

48:17.828 --> 48:20.262
Always nice to meet new people.

48:24.701 --> 48:26.935
Ah, got one.

49:56.593 --> 49:58.460
I got one!

50:04.501 --> 50:05.868
Oh...

50:06.636 --> 50:07.903
Yes.

50:10.607 --> 50:12.875
Nicely done, love.

51:27.183 --> 51:28.584
Hello?

51:28.586 --> 51:30.519
Hello ma'am,
is this Marion Rogers?

51:30.521 --> 51:31.887
Yes, it sure is.

51:31.889 --> 51:33.589
What can I do for you?

51:35.024 --> 51:37.092
Ma'am my name is
Boarstag, I'm investigating

51:37.094 --> 51:39.361
the whereabouts
of Linda steiner.

51:42.866 --> 51:44.366
Hello ma'am?

51:45.335 --> 51:50.305
Oh, I'm sorry, I was
just thinking of your name.

51:50.740 --> 51:52.574
How do you spell that?

51:55.411 --> 52:00.549
- B-o-a-r-s-t-a-g.

52:02.652 --> 52:04.019
It's Lithuanian.

52:04.787 --> 52:06.388
Why isn't that interesting,

52:06.390 --> 52:09.224
I've never heard a name
like that before, it's...

52:09.226 --> 52:11.460
yes ma'am, it's unusual.

52:11.462 --> 52:13.195
Now about miss steiner.

52:13.197 --> 52:17.599
Oh, I'm so sorry, I
drifted there a bit.

52:17.601 --> 52:20.068
Happens when you're
my age, you know.

52:20.070 --> 52:22.271
Yes ma'am, I understand
she and her husband

52:22.273 --> 52:24.139
visited you.

52:24.874 --> 52:27.476
Yes, they did.

52:27.944 --> 52:30.012
Quite some time ago now.

52:30.547 --> 52:32.147
Late may perhaps?

52:32.782 --> 52:34.917
That sounds about right.

52:36.152 --> 52:38.820
And you say this
woman is missing?

52:42.458 --> 52:43.759
Yes ma'am.

52:43.761 --> 52:46.295
Since shortly after
her visit with you.

52:46.763 --> 52:49.231
Well, I'm very
sorry to hear that.

52:49.233 --> 52:51.166
I sure hope you find her.

52:51.168 --> 52:52.401
Thank you ma'am.

52:52.403 --> 52:53.402
Ma'am would you mind if come by

52:53.404 --> 52:54.970
and talk to you about this?

52:54.972 --> 52:57.673
Stop by, my house?

52:58.074 --> 52:59.374
Yes, ma'am, I could
be there in an hour

52:59.376 --> 53:00.375
if that suits.

53:00.377 --> 53:02.144
An hour?

53:04.047 --> 53:05.681
I'll be there in an hour.

53:15.124 --> 53:16.625
He's looking for Linda.

53:45.555 --> 53:48.624
Ladies, I'm Lavrans Boarstag.

53:53.563 --> 53:54.696
Thank you ma'am.

53:55.131 --> 53:56.665
That was very tasty.

53:57.000 --> 53:59.067
Oh, you can call me Marion.

54:01.104 --> 54:05.474
So, the Steiners
found you on uh,

54:05.476 --> 54:07.309
now what did you
call that site again?

54:07.311 --> 54:09.311
Myfreebed.Com.

54:14.117 --> 54:15.884
That's an interesting idea.

54:17.320 --> 54:19.721
Do you get many visitors
from that site to you?

54:19.723 --> 54:21.623
Oh, not that many.

54:21.625 --> 54:23.592
We're kind of out of the way.

54:24.227 --> 54:25.627
Hmm...

54:27.730 --> 54:30.432
So the Steiners found
you through this site,

54:30.434 --> 54:32.367
and then what happened?

54:32.369 --> 54:35.704
Well, they arrived
a bit late one night.

54:35.706 --> 54:40.709
We had a nice chat, and they
left pretty early the next day.

54:41.778 --> 54:43.111
Sweet couple.

54:44.714 --> 54:47.115
They said they
were headed west.

54:47.117 --> 54:48.850
L.A. I think.

54:53.756 --> 54:54.723
Interesting.

54:54.725 --> 54:56.391
Why is that?

54:56.726 --> 54:59.261
Well that doesn't jive with
what they told their friends.

54:59.263 --> 55:00.429
Really?

55:00.863 --> 55:02.364
Really.

55:04.867 --> 55:07.669
Told them they were
heading out to Texas.

55:08.404 --> 55:10.272
Miss steiner had a job
interview out there.

55:17.847 --> 55:19.915
Maybe a change of plans.

55:19.917 --> 55:23.785
They did seem kind of flighty,
if you know what I mean.

55:26.189 --> 55:27.756
Perhaps.

55:30.293 --> 55:31.727
So you haven't seen
either of the Steiners

55:31.729 --> 55:33.428
since they left your place?

55:33.996 --> 55:35.397
After one night?

55:36.666 --> 55:38.066
No.

55:38.835 --> 55:40.235
I see.

55:44.607 --> 55:47.342
Hey ma'am is that
your garage out back?

55:47.945 --> 55:51.146
I asked miss Rogers.

55:54.016 --> 55:55.484
Yes.

55:56.486 --> 55:58.453
That buick park Avenue,

55:58.888 --> 56:02.424
Virginia vanity plate "de
menos", is that your car?

56:05.962 --> 56:07.429
You know it's not.

56:08.498 --> 56:10.432
It belongs to the Steiners.

56:11.300 --> 56:12.734
My gosh.

56:13.936 --> 56:15.704
They leave here walking?

56:16.239 --> 56:19.374
Of course not,
they took the bus.

56:20.476 --> 56:22.477
They left the car behind?

56:24.213 --> 56:26.014
Do you find that unusual?

56:26.849 --> 56:29.351
They were an unusual couple.

56:30.219 --> 56:31.953
So you say.

56:34.056 --> 56:35.357
Well.

56:36.225 --> 56:38.260
I'll be needing to
look at the car.

56:41.931 --> 56:43.698
Oh, one more thing.

56:44.333 --> 56:46.134
Mr. steiner.

56:47.503 --> 56:49.037
What about him?

56:49.039 --> 56:52.574
He does it consulting, so
he's on his computer a lot.

56:54.644 --> 56:55.944
So?

56:56.979 --> 56:59.514
His e-mail address
and his ip headers

56:59.516 --> 57:01.650
come back to this area.

57:05.121 --> 57:06.755
Yesterday.

57:10.860 --> 57:12.093
Ladies.

57:12.562 --> 57:14.196
Ted Steiner's still here.

57:17.266 --> 57:20.535
Of course not, we
told you they left.

57:22.839 --> 57:25.674
Yes ma'am, I know.

57:28.911 --> 57:32.080
Well, mind if I
have a look around?

57:32.782 --> 57:34.883
I don't think
that's gonna be ne...

57:35.384 --> 57:38.420
I can do it now, or I can
come back with the police.

57:39.488 --> 57:41.256
But that's your choice.

57:43.059 --> 57:46.461
Of course, we have
nothing to hide.

58:18.928 --> 58:20.695
Your room upstairs?

58:21.631 --> 58:22.898
No.

58:24.467 --> 58:26.835
More private down
there I suppose.

58:38.114 --> 58:40.615
Of course, be my guest.

58:41.284 --> 58:43.985
I'll stay up here
if you don't mind.

59:01.737 --> 59:03.038
Your room?

59:10.313 --> 59:11.513
May I?

59:35.304 --> 59:37.138
Everybody needs a hobby.

01:00:02.531 --> 01:00:04.933
Mr. steiner I presume?

01:00:12.641 --> 01:00:14.009
Owh!

01:00:33.929 --> 01:00:35.764
You needed a knife.

01:00:59.955 --> 01:01:01.222
Bastard kicked me.

01:01:16.272 --> 01:01:17.772
Let me guess.

01:01:17.774 --> 01:01:20.608
You showed him old home movies?

01:01:51.040 --> 01:01:53.108
That's when everything changed.

01:02:02.351 --> 01:02:03.818
Is that enough?

01:02:06.055 --> 01:02:08.022
I don't know, I hope so.

01:02:09.692 --> 01:02:11.926
It depends on who
he might have told.

01:02:13.629 --> 01:02:15.096
Did you check his phone?

01:02:16.532 --> 01:02:18.500
You know I did, you saw me.

01:02:19.368 --> 01:02:21.903
I saw you look at
it, did you check it?

01:02:21.905 --> 01:02:23.304
Do you wanna do it next time?

01:02:23.306 --> 01:02:24.873
No, I'm just saying
we have to be thorough.

01:02:24.875 --> 01:02:27.909
Oh, yes, thorough.

01:02:27.911 --> 01:02:29.477
Who forgot to take
care of their car?

01:02:29.479 --> 01:02:31.246
Or mask their ip address?

01:02:32.047 --> 01:02:33.448
Who was that?

01:02:45.594 --> 01:02:46.895
You're right.

01:02:53.836 --> 01:02:55.203
I'm sorry.

01:03:09.919 --> 01:03:11.586
What about her?

01:03:13.822 --> 01:03:15.356
What about her?

01:03:15.724 --> 01:03:17.425
She knows.

01:03:18.027 --> 01:03:20.895
No shit she knows, so what?

01:03:21.564 --> 01:03:23.364
She can turn us in.

01:03:25.434 --> 01:03:27.535
If she told, she'd fry too.

01:03:27.537 --> 01:03:30.538
They actually use the death
penalty in this state, remember?

01:03:31.373 --> 01:03:34.242
We just need to lay low
and stay off myfreebed.

01:03:37.346 --> 01:03:39.948
It will all blow over
if we play it cool.

01:03:43.986 --> 01:03:45.620
You okay with that?

01:03:54.196 --> 01:03:55.396
Good.

01:04:19.422 --> 01:04:21.022
You've reached
the Rogers residence,

01:04:21.024 --> 01:04:22.523
we can't take your
call right now,

01:04:22.525 --> 01:04:24.092
but please leave
your name and number

01:04:24.094 --> 01:04:25.426
at the tone and we
will get back to you

01:04:25.428 --> 01:04:27.929
as soon as we can, thanks.

01:04:33.135 --> 01:04:35.770
If you're like
me, you hate telemarketers,

01:04:35.772 --> 01:04:38.840
but hang on, because
what I have to say...

01:04:42.111 --> 01:04:45.046
He's right, I
hate telemarketers.

01:04:52.154 --> 01:04:53.821
It's a fine day.

01:04:55.157 --> 01:04:56.958
Let's take a walk.

01:04:58.827 --> 01:05:00.261
Shall we?

01:05:18.580 --> 01:05:20.982
This town is lovely
in the summertime.

01:05:24.953 --> 01:05:26.387
We should do this more
often, it really...

01:05:26.389 --> 01:05:28.389
you need to do
something about Ted.

01:05:29.024 --> 01:05:30.425
What do you mean?

01:05:30.793 --> 01:05:32.694
He's not handling this well.

01:05:33.262 --> 01:05:35.496
He's a man, he's weak.

01:05:35.964 --> 01:05:38.333
Women are always
stronger, right?

01:05:41.270 --> 01:05:43.004
I'm not sure
if I know what you mean.

01:05:43.006 --> 01:05:44.939
He puts us at risk.

01:05:49.645 --> 01:05:50.678
I...

01:05:52.414 --> 01:05:54.215
I don't think I can do that.

01:05:55.084 --> 01:05:57.051
Of course you can dear.

01:06:01.457 --> 01:06:05.426
Beautiful, don't you just
love red roses in bloom.

01:06:47.636 --> 01:06:49.036
Nice walk?

01:06:49.872 --> 01:06:51.239
Lovely.

01:06:52.608 --> 01:06:55.009
Would you be a dear and
get me some lemonade?

01:06:55.011 --> 01:06:56.677
Hot outside.

01:07:02.451 --> 01:07:03.951
With ice.

01:07:08.791 --> 01:07:10.091
My pleasure.

01:08:09.518 --> 01:08:11.185
Did you have a nice day?

01:08:13.222 --> 01:08:14.689
Fine.

01:08:17.526 --> 01:08:20.495
Kinda strange, her
wanting to take a walk, huh?

01:08:27.502 --> 01:08:29.337
What did you two talk about?

01:08:30.339 --> 01:08:31.706
Flowers.

01:08:33.175 --> 01:08:34.542
The weather.

01:08:42.484 --> 01:08:44.018
Current events.

01:08:54.462 --> 01:08:55.897
I'm gonna go to sleep.

01:09:56.692 --> 01:09:58.559
What are you doing down here?

01:09:59.528 --> 01:10:01.062
This is my house.

01:10:01.997 --> 01:10:03.698
What are you doing here?

01:10:04.433 --> 01:10:05.366
I wan...

01:10:05.368 --> 01:10:06.608
we're just cleaning up a bit.

01:10:07.536 --> 01:10:09.170
Long overdue, really.

01:10:10.038 --> 01:10:11.072
That's mine.

01:10:11.074 --> 01:10:14.275
Oh, you better take it then.

01:10:36.298 --> 01:10:38.466
Ted, we're having
lunch outside.

01:10:40.302 --> 01:10:41.802
I'll be right out.

01:10:44.172 --> 01:10:45.940
All right, let's eat.

01:10:51.713 --> 01:10:53.381
What's going on?

01:10:55.784 --> 01:10:56.484
We de...

01:10:56.486 --> 01:10:58.052
let me, dear.

01:10:59.121 --> 01:11:00.554
Have a seat.

01:11:08.897 --> 01:11:11.499
We think it's best
that you leave.

01:11:13.535 --> 01:11:14.702
What?

01:11:18.240 --> 01:11:19.440
We?

01:11:24.012 --> 01:11:25.646
Do you agree with this?

01:11:26.181 --> 01:11:28.883
She's upset enough,
don't make it worse.

01:11:29.284 --> 01:11:30.584
She's upset?

01:11:32.921 --> 01:11:36.257
Things change,
we have to adjust.

01:11:36.725 --> 01:11:40.061
Adjust, by me leaving?

01:11:42.931 --> 01:11:44.432
I don't think so.

01:11:44.434 --> 01:11:47.334
It's best if you leave
as soon as possible.

01:11:49.371 --> 01:11:51.138
You don't understand.

01:11:51.807 --> 01:11:53.641
I'm not going anywhere.

01:11:56.611 --> 01:11:58.913
I thought you might say that.

01:11:59.514 --> 01:12:00.948
Look at it this way.

01:12:01.383 --> 01:12:04.952
If you don't go, we'll
pin it all on you.

01:12:06.254 --> 01:12:10.124
After all it's your
wife and your car.

01:12:11.993 --> 01:12:14.628
You had motive, and ability.

01:12:15.430 --> 01:12:17.932
I'm just a little old lady.

01:12:18.400 --> 01:12:20.901
Who do you think
they'll believe?

01:12:30.746 --> 01:12:32.146
I'm sorry.

01:12:35.884 --> 01:12:37.318
I love you.

01:12:39.254 --> 01:12:40.721
I love you.

01:12:51.333 --> 01:12:53.334
I'm not going anywhere.

01:12:55.570 --> 01:12:57.438
I know a thing or two, too.

01:12:58.974 --> 01:13:03.043
We'll all fry together.

01:13:15.391 --> 01:13:16.757
Morning.

01:13:18.059 --> 01:13:20.127
Hey, I'm thinking about
going into town later.

01:13:20.129 --> 01:13:21.996
Does anybody need anything?

01:13:21.998 --> 01:13:23.464
Nothing for me.

01:13:58.534 --> 01:13:59.834
Marion!

01:14:02.404 --> 01:14:03.838
Call 911.

01:14:11.713 --> 01:14:13.747
Call 911!

01:14:17.652 --> 01:14:21.121
I don't know what happened.

01:14:21.756 --> 01:14:23.958
I thought we solved
this problem before.

01:14:23.960 --> 01:14:25.626
Oh Sam.

01:14:26.228 --> 01:14:28.095
Don't you "oh Sam" me.

01:14:29.097 --> 01:14:31.498
You gotta be careful with
these pills you're taking.

01:14:31.500 --> 01:14:34.235
They get mixed,
big time bad news.

01:14:35.103 --> 01:14:37.137
I've you known you
since were a little girl,

01:14:37.139 --> 01:14:38.973
don't you worry about me.

01:14:39.441 --> 01:14:42.610
And don't even think about
taking me to the hospital.

01:14:44.145 --> 01:14:46.247
I'm not going anywhere.

01:14:52.954 --> 01:14:55.322
I still think you should've
gone to the hospital.

01:14:56.791 --> 01:14:58.726
For observation, like Sam said.

01:14:59.060 --> 01:15:01.829
I can observe myself just fine.

01:15:01.831 --> 01:15:04.198
And I have you to
help me, right?

01:15:05.100 --> 01:15:05.933
Of course.

01:15:20.248 --> 01:15:21.715
He did this.

01:15:24.486 --> 01:15:26.220
No, I don't believe it.

01:15:26.888 --> 01:15:28.289
It's easy to confuse your
pills, you put your...

01:15:28.291 --> 01:15:30.257
no, no, it was him.

01:15:30.259 --> 01:15:32.593
I remember thinking that
my pillbox was moved,

01:15:32.595 --> 01:15:34.962
but I took the pills anyway.

01:15:36.364 --> 01:15:37.965
That's crazy.

01:15:38.767 --> 01:15:42.469
Killing your wife for a
woman you just met, is crazy.

01:15:42.471 --> 01:15:45.239
Him trying to kill
me makes sense.

01:15:48.376 --> 01:15:50.344
Ted and I are in love.

01:15:53.982 --> 01:15:56.150
Seriously, your
pillbox was moved?

01:15:59.254 --> 01:16:01.322
You're jumping at shadows.

01:16:02.457 --> 01:16:04.325
You'll have to kill him.

01:16:09.464 --> 01:16:11.432
It's the only way out.

01:16:42.698 --> 01:16:44.064
Now that is getting up.

01:16:49.237 --> 01:16:51.572
Hey, looks like
you're feeling better.

01:16:52.040 --> 01:16:54.975
In that case it
is a fine morning.

01:16:55.610 --> 01:16:57.244
So, who's hungry?

01:16:57.579 --> 01:16:58.746
I know I am.

01:16:58.748 --> 01:17:00.614
Me too, I could eat a horse.

01:17:00.949 --> 01:17:02.783
Must be all the exercise.

01:17:03.218 --> 01:17:04.752
Okay, I'm on it.

01:17:05.120 --> 01:17:07.554
Bacon and eggs, all around.

01:17:10.458 --> 01:17:11.959
You're not hungry?

01:17:12.761 --> 01:17:14.194
Are you feeling okay?

01:17:15.196 --> 01:17:16.730
I feel fine.

01:17:18.700 --> 01:17:20.300
Are you gonna eat that?

01:17:21.002 --> 01:17:23.404
Yes, I am.

01:17:24.239 --> 01:17:25.806
Just checking.

01:18:02.710 --> 01:18:04.278
Going to bed?

01:18:05.613 --> 01:18:07.548
Everything is gonna be fine.

01:18:08.216 --> 01:18:09.349
You'll see.

01:18:09.818 --> 01:18:11.885
I wish I could be so sure.

01:18:13.354 --> 01:18:15.789
Everything will be
better in the morning.

01:18:25.500 --> 01:18:26.733
Sleep well.

01:18:27.135 --> 01:18:28.102
You too.

01:19:26.661 --> 01:19:28.028
Hey boy.

01:19:30.098 --> 01:19:31.498
You thirsty?

01:19:32.333 --> 01:19:34.368
Not yet, but I will be.

01:20:35.430 --> 01:20:37.464
This is all for
the best, my love.

01:20:43.438 --> 01:20:44.638
Calmly, please.

01:20:57.018 --> 01:20:58.652
It will all be over soon.

01:21:42.363 --> 01:21:43.997
Lay back, sweetheart.
