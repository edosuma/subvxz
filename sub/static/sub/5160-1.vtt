00:41.408 --> 00:44.201
- Exiting time knot now, sir.
- We're alive.

00:44.285 --> 00:46.161
We made it, Commander. We made it.

00:46.246 --> 00:49.707
By Grabthar's hammer,
we live to tell the tale.

00:49.791 --> 00:51.834
Systems register functional.

00:51.918 --> 00:54.712
All systems are working, Commander.

00:54.796 --> 00:57.214
I don't like it. It was too easy.

00:58.508 --> 01:02.136
Wait! Oh, no. They're everywhere!

01:02.220 --> 01:03.846
There are time knots
opening everywhere!

01:03.930 --> 01:06.306
- A trap!
- We're surrounded, Commander.

01:11.271 --> 01:14.440
It's a core meltdown, sir.
It can't be stopped.

01:14.524 --> 01:17.317
Surrender may be our only option.

01:17.402 --> 01:21.405
No! Never give up! Never surrender!

01:22.073 --> 01:23.699
Your orders, sir?

01:25.702 --> 01:27.327
Sir? Your orders?

01:30.498 --> 01:32.958
Activate the Omega 13.

01:36.171 --> 01:37.463
Well?

01:40.759 --> 01:42.968
Well, there you are. Yeah!

01:46.264 --> 01:49.892
Yeah! Yeah,
that's what I'm talking about!

01:51.144 --> 01:54.063
You are the first people to see

01:54.147 --> 01:58.817
the lost Galaxy Quest
episode 92 two-parter

01:58.902 --> 02:01.528
since it was originally aired in 1982!

02:02.322 --> 02:03.947
Yeah! All right.

02:05.241 --> 02:08.535
Now, the moment
you've all been waiting for.

02:08.620 --> 02:15.501
The intrepid crew
of the NSEA Protector! Yeah!

02:15.794 --> 02:19.505
Red scarf, black shoes. Wait.

02:21.466 --> 02:24.843
White scarf, black buttons,
white shoes...

02:27.097 --> 02:29.932
Man, where the hell is he?
An hour and a half late?

02:30.016 --> 02:33.185
- An hour and a half.
- I mean, this is unreal.

02:33.269 --> 02:35.562
They're gonna start
eating each other out there.

02:35.647 --> 02:39.191
Did you hear? He booked
another appearance without us.

02:39.275 --> 02:40.275
You're kidding!

02:49.160 --> 02:51.537
- How did I come to this?
- Not again.

02:51.621 --> 02:54.123
- I played Richard the Third.
- Five curtain calls.

02:54.207 --> 02:56.500
There were five curtain calls.
I was an actor once,

02:56.584 --> 02:58.293
damn it, now look at me. Look at me!

02:58.378 --> 03:02.673
I can't go out there, and I won't
say that stupid line one more time!

03:04.050 --> 03:07.386
- I can't, I won't.
- Well, Alex, at least you had a part.

03:07.470 --> 03:09.805
Okay? You had
a character people loved.

03:09.889 --> 03:13.851
I mean, my TV Guide interview
was six paragraphs about my boobs

03:13.935 --> 03:15.686
and how they fit into my suit.

03:15.770 --> 03:19.189
No one even bothered to ask me
what I do on the show.

03:20.233 --> 03:24.069
You had the... Wait. Wait, I'll think of it.

03:24.154 --> 03:26.405
I repeated the computer, Fred.

03:27.574 --> 03:29.575
Your commander is on deck!

03:31.035 --> 03:33.745
Wow, that smog is thick today, huh?

03:33.830 --> 03:36.665
Am I too late
for Alexander's panic attack?

03:37.792 --> 03:42.713
Apparently not. You know,
you should get that looked at. Yeah.

03:43.590 --> 03:45.507
Let's take a look at a few more clips.

03:45.592 --> 03:48.051
Okay. What did I do?

03:50.388 --> 03:51.471
What?

03:51.681 --> 03:53.182
- We want the crew!
- For those four seasons,

03:53.266 --> 03:56.560
we developed
the same affection for the crew

03:56.644 --> 03:58.145
as the crew had for each other.

03:58.229 --> 04:03.817
I mean, these weren't just adventurers
exploring space. These were friends.

04:03.902 --> 04:06.737
- Unbelievable.
- You are so full of it, man!

04:06.821 --> 04:09.156
It's not a big deal. These guys put
a little set in their basement.

04:09.240 --> 04:11.033
I'm there about an hour.

04:11.117 --> 04:14.286
It's nothing, Gwen.
They wanted the Commander.

04:14.370 --> 04:17.206
- There he goes.
- Alexander, wait! Grab him! Grab him!

04:17.290 --> 04:19.416
- We want the crew!
- We want the crew!

04:19.500 --> 04:23.879
Okay! Yeah! Here we go!

04:23.963 --> 04:26.381
- Come on, old friend, old friend.
- Friend?

04:26.466 --> 04:30.052
You stole all my best lines,
you cut me out of episode two entirely!

04:30.136 --> 04:35.057
Tawny Madison, my personal favorite,
Gwen DeMarco!

04:36.476 --> 04:37.726
Yeah!

04:37.810 --> 04:39.561
It's getting hotter, Commander.

04:39.646 --> 04:41.271
Yeah, that's what I'm talking about!

04:41.356 --> 04:47.319
Let's hear a warm welcome for
crack gunner Laredo, Tommy Webber!

04:48.988 --> 04:51.240
- You will go out there!
- I won't.

04:51.324 --> 04:54.076
- And nothing you say will make me.
- The show must go on.

04:54.160 --> 04:55.661
Freddie Kwan!

04:58.873 --> 05:00.165
Damn you.

05:01.334 --> 05:05.587
Damn you. I won't say
that stupid line one more time.

05:05.672 --> 05:09.508
Tev'Meck, Alexander Dane!

05:09.592 --> 05:12.177
Yeah! All right!

05:14.514 --> 05:18.767
By Grabthar's hammer,
you shall be avenged!

05:18.851 --> 05:21.103
Yeah! All right!

05:22.355 --> 05:24.022
That guy can act.

05:24.440 --> 05:28.318
And finally, my fellow Questerians,

05:28.403 --> 05:33.198
the brave commander
of the NSEA Protector,

05:33.283 --> 05:35.284
Peter, Peter, Peter, Peter...

05:35.368 --> 05:37.494
Quincy, Quincy, Quincy, Quincy...

05:37.578 --> 05:39.246
Taggart, Taggart, Taggart, Taggart...

05:39.330 --> 05:41.957
Jason Nesmith!

05:42.041 --> 05:44.876
Yeah! All right!

05:48.756 --> 05:50.841
We love you, Commander!

05:53.219 --> 05:54.594
- Never give up.
- Never give up.

05:54.679 --> 05:56.346
- Never surrender!
- Never surrender!

05:56.431 --> 05:58.140
- Damn the resonance cannons,
- Damn the resonance cannons,

05:58.224 --> 06:00.809
- full speed ahead!
- Full speed ahead!

06:03.104 --> 06:06.481
The Commander and his crew
will be signing autographs

06:06.566 --> 06:09.901
on imperial decks C and B
near the Coke machines.

06:11.487 --> 06:13.864
Quest forever, man!

06:14.407 --> 06:16.950
Excuse me, pardon me,
crew member coming through.

06:17.035 --> 06:19.453
- Fans, right? Hey, Gwen.
- Hey, man.

06:19.537 --> 06:22.914
I want to thank you for that nice intro
you gave us today.

06:22.999 --> 06:27.419
Guy. Probably don't remember me,
do you? It's the sunglasses, right?

06:27.503 --> 06:30.047
I was on the show in '82, episode 81.

06:30.131 --> 06:33.675
Got killed by a lava monster
before the first commercial.

06:33.760 --> 06:38.680
Listen, maybe I could sit in
and sign a couple of autographs?

06:38.765 --> 06:42.726
By Grabthar's hammer, by the sons
of Warvan, I shall avenge you!

06:48.483 --> 06:50.108
By Grabthar's...

06:51.611 --> 06:52.736
Next.

06:53.446 --> 06:56.573
Had I moved an inch to the left,
the beast would have killed me.

06:56.657 --> 06:58.367
On the other hand,
my crew was in danger.

06:58.451 --> 06:59.701
How did you know what to do?

06:59.786 --> 07:03.288
Come on! Without my crew,
I'm not a commander, huh?

07:04.248 --> 07:08.627
I think we all remember what happened
to that beast on Enok Vll, right?

07:09.587 --> 07:12.881
You've got to admit,
they really do love him.

07:13.674 --> 07:16.468
Yeah, almost as much
as he loves himself.

07:18.638 --> 07:21.223
Excuse me, Commander. Hey!

07:21.307 --> 07:23.308
I was wondering if you could help
settle the dispute

07:23.393 --> 07:25.977
that my crew and I seem to be having.

07:26.062 --> 07:28.897
If you remember,
in "Quasar Dilemma"...

07:28.981 --> 07:31.316
Excuse me for a minute, fellas.

07:33.778 --> 07:35.862
Hadn't even gotten to
the relevant conundrum.

07:35.947 --> 07:38.990
In episode 15, "Mist of Delos V,"

07:39.075 --> 07:43.412
I got the feeling that you
and the Commander kind of had a thing.

07:43.496 --> 07:44.913
Did you?

07:44.997 --> 07:47.916
No. The Commander and I
never had a thing.

07:48.000 --> 07:49.876
Well, that's her story.

07:54.715 --> 07:56.049
Excuse me.

07:57.969 --> 07:59.094
Gwen.

08:01.055 --> 08:05.267
Gwen!

08:07.103 --> 08:08.603
- Commander.
- Excuse me.

08:08.688 --> 08:11.273
I must speak to you.
It is a matter of supreme importance.

08:11.357 --> 08:13.567
We are Thermians
from the Klatu Nebula

08:13.651 --> 08:15.735
and we need your help.

08:18.197 --> 08:19.948
Is this about that gig tomorrow?

08:20.032 --> 08:21.700
Just hammer out the details
with my agent,

08:21.784 --> 08:23.577
and make sure
there's a limo at my house.

08:23.661 --> 08:27.664
Last time I did one of these gigs,
they shoved me in the back of a Toyota.

08:27.748 --> 08:29.749
Remember, mum's the word.

08:30.585 --> 08:32.501
Certainly, but...

08:32.587 --> 08:35.505
- Mum.
- Mum.

08:37.216 --> 08:39.049
Here, and beautiful!

08:42.722 --> 08:45.640
Crewman Madison,
the mist of this strange planet

08:45.725 --> 08:48.977
is filling my head with such thoughts.

08:49.061 --> 08:51.563
It was cute when I didn't know you.

09:19.759 --> 09:23.845
What a freak show, man.
This is hilarious.

09:23.930 --> 09:28.016
Bunch of losers! Begging
for autographs at 15 bucks a pop.

09:28.100 --> 09:31.645
These guys haven't had a real acting
job for 20 years. This is all they've got.

09:31.729 --> 09:33.355
And did you check out Nesmith?

09:33.439 --> 09:35.482
- He actually gets off on those retards...
- Oh, yeah.

09:35.566 --> 09:37.317
...thinking he's a space commander!

09:37.401 --> 09:40.320
- And his friends...
- I know, they can't stand him!

09:40.404 --> 09:41.530
Did you hear them ragging
on him in there?

09:41.614 --> 09:44.074
Dude, he has no idea
he's a laughingstock,

09:44.158 --> 09:45.450
even to his buddies.

09:45.535 --> 09:47.619
- He's pathetic!
- Come on, come on.

09:47.703 --> 09:50.205
The Galaxy Quest dancers
are almost on.

09:50.289 --> 09:52.499
Full speed ahead, Lieutenant.

10:05.429 --> 10:06.763
Hey, Commander,

10:06.847 --> 10:09.849
so as I was saying
in "The Quasar Dilemma,"

10:09.934 --> 10:11.935
remember, you used
the auxiliary deck B for...

10:12.019 --> 10:14.312
Can you get this?
Deck B for gamma override.

10:14.397 --> 10:17.274
The thing is that
online blueprints clearly indicate that

10:17.358 --> 10:19.985
deck B is independent
of the guidance matrix.

10:20.069 --> 10:23.655
So we were wondering,
just where the error lies in that?

10:23.739 --> 10:27.659
It's just a television show.
That's all, okay?

10:27.743 --> 10:31.162
Right, but... 'Cause we were wondering
if the quantum flux, nowjust listen...

10:31.247 --> 10:34.749
There is no quantum flux.
There's no auxiliary.

10:34.834 --> 10:38.169
There's no goddamn ship!

10:38.254 --> 10:39.629
You got it?

10:50.850 --> 10:52.851
I mean it. I mean it, Alex.

10:52.935 --> 10:56.104
I've never seen him lose it like that.
Not to a fan.

10:56.188 --> 10:58.231
I mean, it was just weird.

10:58.774 --> 11:02.569
Gwen, I have said it for years.

11:02.653 --> 11:04.529
He's mentally unstable.

11:05.114 --> 11:09.117
I... I'm worried. It just was not like him.

11:29.013 --> 11:32.182
As long as there is injustice,

11:32.266 --> 11:35.143
whenever a Targathian baby cries out,

11:35.227 --> 11:36.978
wherever a distress signal sounds,

11:37.063 --> 11:38.229
- among the stars...
- Among the stars...

11:38.314 --> 11:39.439
...we'll be there.

11:39.523 --> 11:42.859
- This fine ship and this fine crew.
- This fine ship and this fine crew.

11:42.943 --> 11:44.361
- Never give up.
- Never give up.

11:44.445 --> 11:47.280
- Never surrender.
- Never surrender.

12:44.797 --> 12:46.047
Can I help you?

12:46.132 --> 12:48.717
Sir, I understand this is a terrible breach
in protocol...

12:48.801 --> 12:52.011
- You shouldn't come to my house, man.
- Please, I beg you to hear our plea.

12:52.096 --> 12:54.597
We are Thermians
from the Klatu Nebula.

12:54.682 --> 12:57.559
Our people are being systematically
hunted and slaughtered

12:57.643 --> 12:59.728
by Roth'h'ar Sarris of Fatu-Krey.

12:59.812 --> 13:01.312
We are to meet in negotiation.

13:01.397 --> 13:05.108
However, our efforts in this regard
have been disastrous.

13:05.192 --> 13:09.487
Please, Commander.
You are our last hope.

13:12.199 --> 13:15.577
- We have secured our limousine.
- What?

13:18.789 --> 13:21.624
It's the thing for the thing that's...

13:25.004 --> 13:27.422
Maybe I should get some pants on.

13:28.966 --> 13:30.341
Come on in.

13:35.055 --> 13:39.309
Commander, I must say that
standing here in your presence

13:39.393 --> 13:43.855
is the greatest honor we could ever
have hoped to achieve in our lifetime.

13:43.939 --> 13:46.483
That's... I really appreciate that.

13:46.567 --> 13:50.653
Would you guys look for another shoe
that looks like this, please?

13:59.455 --> 14:02.582
Sir, I am Lahnk,
senior requisition officer.

14:02.666 --> 14:05.877
Before we travel to the ship, please let
me know if you have any requirements.

14:05.961 --> 14:08.171
Weapons, documents, personnel.

14:08.255 --> 14:10.882
A Coca-Cola, do you have one of those?

14:11.801 --> 14:13.885
Sir, I am Teb.

14:15.012 --> 14:17.597
I would like to explain the history
between our people

14:17.681 --> 14:19.641
and the Sarris dominion
in greater detail.

14:19.725 --> 14:20.850
Hey, how you doing?

14:20.935 --> 14:24.479
In the five million years following
the Great Nebula Burst,

14:24.563 --> 14:25.980
our people were one...

14:26.065 --> 14:27.690
What's your name?

14:28.567 --> 14:31.986
- Doesn't she talk?
- Her translator is broken.

14:36.158 --> 14:37.951
Okey-dokey.

14:38.035 --> 14:42.080
You know, guys, I had a late night
with a Kreemorian fangor beast,

14:42.164 --> 14:46.334
so I'm gonna just shut my eyes for a bit.

14:46.418 --> 14:50.672
Go on. You know? I'm listening
to everything you say, okay?

14:50.756 --> 14:54.008
In the five million years following
the Great Nebula Burst,

14:54.093 --> 14:55.552
our people were one people.

14:55.636 --> 15:00.932
But then came the Zactor Migration,
and then the Melosian Shift

15:01.016 --> 15:05.228
and a dark period of discontent
spread through the land.

15:05.312 --> 15:09.691
Fighting among Treeb sects
and Largoths. The foolishness!

15:09.775 --> 15:13.403
And it was in this time
of dissension that Sarris...

15:20.244 --> 15:23.872
Commander. Commander?

15:23.956 --> 15:25.540
I'm sorry to wake you, sir,

15:25.624 --> 15:28.918
but your presence is requested
on the command deck.

15:33.507 --> 15:35.383
Sir, Sarris has moved the deadline.

15:35.467 --> 15:38.553
We are approaching his ship
at the Ni-Delta now.

15:38.637 --> 15:40.930
He wants an answer to his proposal.
I understand...

15:41.015 --> 15:43.433
I got most of it in the car.
Sarris is the bad guy, right?

15:43.517 --> 15:45.602
Oh, yes, sir.
He's a very bad man indeed.

15:45.686 --> 15:47.312
He has tortured our scientists,

15:47.396 --> 15:49.689
put us to work
in the gallium arsenide mines,

15:49.773 --> 15:51.816
captured our females
for his own demented purposes...

15:51.901 --> 15:53.192
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
I got the picture.

15:53.277 --> 15:55.612
Do you have pages
or just want me to wing this?

15:55.696 --> 15:57.238
I am not sure I understand you.

15:57.323 --> 15:59.741
Commander, welcome
to the Protector Two.

15:59.825 --> 16:02.201
- Good to see you.
- Would you like to don your uniform?

16:02.286 --> 16:03.620
No, you know what? I'd like to skip that.

16:03.704 --> 16:06.789
I got this gig in Van Nuys in about
a quarter of an hour. Is that all right?

16:06.874 --> 16:10.668
- As you wish.
- Sir, it's Sarris. He's here.

16:17.801 --> 16:20.053
General, I have just received word

16:20.137 --> 16:21.971
the Thermians have appointed
a new commander

16:22.056 --> 16:24.182
to handle the negotiations.

16:25.017 --> 16:26.142
What?

16:30.898 --> 16:35.151
This is great. You know, usually
it's just cardboard walls in a garage.

16:35.235 --> 16:38.237
Sir, we apologize
for operating in low-power mode,

16:38.322 --> 16:41.407
but we are experiencing
a reflective flux field

16:41.492 --> 16:44.118
this close to the galactic axis.

16:44.203 --> 16:47.246
You know, what I could use is
a cup holder and a couple ofAdvil.

16:47.331 --> 16:50.625
We're approaching in five ticks, sir.
Command to slow?

16:50.709 --> 16:53.169
Set it on screensaver two.

16:54.713 --> 16:58.299
I guess, we, you know, got to...

16:58.384 --> 17:01.636
I'm sorry to break up the mood here.

17:01.720 --> 17:04.222
Slow it down to mark two, Lieutenant.

17:04.306 --> 17:07.517
I see fear. That is expected.

17:10.561 --> 17:13.189
- They bring a new commander.
- It's good.

17:13.272 --> 17:15.566
- Here are my demands.
- Scary. I mean, you know, it looks...

17:15.651 --> 17:18.277
- And if I do not hear what I like,
...real.

17:18.362 --> 17:24.032
Then there will be blood and pain
as you cannot imagine!

17:25.786 --> 17:26.953
- First...
- Backwash.

17:27.037 --> 17:30.540
...I require the Omega 13.

17:30.624 --> 17:33.876
Second, I will require a technician...

17:33.961 --> 17:38.673
Okey-dokey! Okey-dokey!
Let's fire blue particle cannons full,

17:38.757 --> 17:40.258
red particle cannons full,

17:40.342 --> 17:44.637
gannet magnets, fire them left and right
and let them run all chutes.

17:44.722 --> 17:47.849
And while you're at it,
why don't you toss that at them, killer?

17:47.933 --> 17:50.518
That should take care
of old lobster head, shouldn't it?

17:50.602 --> 17:51.728
Yeah.

17:59.903 --> 18:01.696
Commander, where are you going?

18:01.780 --> 18:03.948
- Home.
- You mean Earth?

18:04.033 --> 18:05.575
Yeah, Earth.
I need to get back to Earth, kids.

18:05.659 --> 18:08.786
But the negotiations, you fired on him.

18:08.871 --> 18:11.289
Yeah. Yeah. Long live...
What was your planet called?

18:11.373 --> 18:13.833
- Thermia.
- Long live Thermia. This way?

18:13.917 --> 18:15.334
What if Sarris survives?

18:15.419 --> 18:18.337
- I doubt it. We gave him both barrels.
- He has a very powerful ship.

18:18.422 --> 18:20.214
If you got any more problems
with the guy,

18:20.299 --> 18:22.592
just, you know, give me a call.

18:24.845 --> 18:28.556
- An interstellar vox.
- A what? Hey.

18:28.640 --> 18:30.933
How can we thank you, Commander?

18:32.186 --> 18:34.312
You have saved our people.

18:37.066 --> 18:38.816
Yeah. Okay.

18:38.901 --> 18:41.736
You know, you kids have been great.
You really have.

18:41.820 --> 18:43.529
This thing is real-looking.

18:43.614 --> 18:45.156
Yoo-hoo. Hello?

18:47.826 --> 18:50.703
Hey! Where's my limo?

20:06.655 --> 20:10.491
Take it from us,
we've been all over the universe.

20:10.576 --> 20:15.246
But we've never seen space-age
values like we've seen here at...

20:15.330 --> 20:17.999
Tech Value Electronics Superstore!

20:26.091 --> 20:28.176
By Grabthar's hammer,

20:31.513 --> 20:33.097
what a savings.

20:35.601 --> 20:39.395
All right! Yeah, let's hear it
for the NSEA Protector.

20:39.479 --> 20:40.646
Vacuum laser...

20:40.731 --> 20:42.481
What, no, no, no, no.
You've got it all wrong.

20:42.566 --> 20:44.317
Yes, if he's down in the Omega 13...

20:44.401 --> 20:48.237
- Brandon, are you okay?
- Commander! My apologies.

20:48.322 --> 20:51.115
You know, evidently we had
a little miscommunication

20:51.200 --> 20:54.952
regarding the voyage.
You didn't show up.

20:57.581 --> 21:00.750
- He...
- He did it again.

21:04.796 --> 21:06.255
Do you know what time it is?

21:06.340 --> 21:08.549
Why do you even bother
to show up at all?

21:08.634 --> 21:12.053
No, no, no, no. Guys, I was there.

21:12.137 --> 21:13.763
I was up there.

21:13.847 --> 21:16.641
Remember yesterday at the convention,
those people dressed like aliens?

21:16.725 --> 21:19.393
They were aliens.
They were Termites or Dalmatians.

21:19.478 --> 21:21.771
I can't really remember
'cause I was kind of hung-over.

21:21.855 --> 21:25.399
But what they built was extraordinary.
It was a huge spaceship.

21:25.484 --> 21:29.153
I got to fight this guy named Sarris
and I kicked his ass!

21:31.490 --> 21:35.618
I know what you're thinking.
But I can prove it. They gave me this.

21:37.788 --> 21:41.832
No, no, no, no, no. But can you
talk to people in space on those?

21:42.334 --> 21:44.252
Protector, this is the Commander. Over.

21:44.336 --> 21:47.213
- Oh, for God's sake.
- That's it. It's time to go!

21:47.297 --> 21:48.923
This isn't mine.

21:49.758 --> 21:51.217
That kid. Where's that kid?

21:51.301 --> 21:55.054
Begging your pardon, Commander,
we come with news. Sarris lives.

21:55.138 --> 21:56.264
- He was able upon your departure...
- Listen.

21:56.348 --> 21:57.598
...to make an escape.
- Tell them.

21:57.683 --> 21:59.141
- However, he has contacted us...
- Sarris.

21:59.226 --> 22:00.643
...and wishes to negotiate a surrender.

22:00.727 --> 22:04.438
We humbly implore you to come
and negotiate the terms.

22:05.607 --> 22:08.109
They want me back?
You want me back?

22:08.193 --> 22:09.443
Is this amazing? They want me back,

22:09.528 --> 22:11.237
and I want you guys
to go with me, please.

22:11.321 --> 22:14.115
Don't even think about it. Let's go. Yes!

22:14.700 --> 22:18.035
You're going? Alexander, this is not...
I'm not kidding here!

22:18.120 --> 22:22.123
This isn't some kind of prank!
I'm not kidding. Guys, guys, listen.

22:22.207 --> 22:25.459
Come on. Gwen, Gwen, Gwen, Gwen.
Stop, come here.

22:25.544 --> 22:27.670
You know me.
I'm a lot of things, but am I crazy?

22:27.754 --> 22:29.880
You know,
it's one thing to treat us this way.

22:29.965 --> 22:32.758
It's another thing to do it to your fans.

22:33.552 --> 22:36.053
She's not a fan! This is a Termite!

22:38.515 --> 22:39.765
You should've just let me hit him.

22:39.850 --> 22:44.228
Boy, I didn't know
you could get that loaded.

22:44.313 --> 22:47.356
I think we should've just taken the gig.

22:47.441 --> 22:49.775
I mean, who knows
the next time he'll ask us.

22:49.860 --> 22:53.988
Fred, he was drunk. Do you really
think he was talking about a job?

23:00.579 --> 23:01.662
But you live with your mother.

23:01.747 --> 23:05.583
- Did Jason come through here?
- Yeah, he's in there. Hey, guys.

23:07.252 --> 23:08.878
We are coming, too.

23:08.962 --> 23:13.507
- All of you wish to go to the ship?
- Yes, we wish to go to the ship.

23:13.592 --> 23:16.510
You see, we work together, or not at all.

23:16.595 --> 23:19.680
Wonderful. The Commander
had me continue transmission

23:19.765 --> 23:21.807
in case you changed your mind.

23:21.892 --> 23:26.479
- Protector, requesting four interstellar...
- Me, too.

23:26.563 --> 23:28.981
Five pods for immediate departure.

23:32.402 --> 23:35.363
Guys. Guys?

23:35.447 --> 23:38.908
I look forward to meeting you all
in person when you arrive at the ship.

23:38.992 --> 23:40.618
End transmission.

23:43.288 --> 23:44.622
Oh, my God.

23:46.792 --> 23:48.751
Anybody got any change?

24:57.070 --> 24:59.155
Our most sincere apologies.

24:59.239 --> 25:02.324
We forgot about
our appearance generators.

25:02.409 --> 25:05.119
You guys came!
Who wants the grand tour?

25:12.919 --> 25:14.378
Anybody else?

25:17.591 --> 25:19.717
That was a hell of a thing.

25:23.889 --> 25:26.307
- What's wrong with them?
- I don't know. Come on.

25:27.184 --> 25:29.143
That's right, guys, just keep shaking
it off, it gets better.

25:29.227 --> 25:32.271
- Hey, try some gum. It helps.
- Where are we?

25:32.355 --> 25:34.482
The 23rd quadrant
of the Gamma sector.

25:34.566 --> 25:36.859
There's a map in the core room.
I'll show you, come on.

25:36.943 --> 25:40.863
- Welcome, my friends!
- This is Mathesar, he's their leader.

25:40.947 --> 25:45.326
I am Mathesar. On behalf of
all my people I wish to thank you

25:45.410 --> 25:49.497
- from the deepest place in our hearts.
- Mathesar, this is my crew.

25:52.709 --> 25:54.335
Dr. Lazarus.

25:54.419 --> 25:56.462
- Dr. Lazarus.
- Dr. Lazarus.

25:58.965 --> 26:01.425
Lieutenant Madison.

26:01.510 --> 26:04.220
- Lieutenant Madison.
- Lieutenant Madison.

26:08.475 --> 26:11.685
Young Laredo, how you've grown.

26:11.770 --> 26:13.938
- Young Laredo.
- Young Laredo.

26:16.274 --> 26:18.317
Tech Sergeant Chen.

26:18.401 --> 26:21.070
- Tech Sergeant Chen.
- Tech Sergeant Chen.

26:25.492 --> 26:28.869
Crewman number... Guy.

26:28.954 --> 26:30.913
- Guy.
- Guy.

26:30.997 --> 26:33.499
You know us?

26:36.461 --> 26:40.256
I don't believe there is a man, woman
or child on my planet who does not.

26:40.340 --> 26:42.258
For years since we first
received transmission

26:42.342 --> 26:44.009
of your historical documents,

26:44.094 --> 26:47.304
we have studied every facet
of your missions and strategies.

26:47.389 --> 26:48.722
You've been watching the show?

26:48.807 --> 26:52.101
Lieutenant, historical documents.

26:52.185 --> 26:54.895
Historical documents from out here?

26:54.980 --> 26:58.899
Yes. The past 100 years,
our society had fallen into disarray.

26:58.984 --> 27:02.236
Our goals, our values had become
scattered, but since the transmission,

27:02.320 --> 27:06.532
we have modeled every aspect
of our society from your example,

27:06.616 --> 27:09.034
and it has saved us.

27:09.119 --> 27:13.497
Your courage and teamwork
and friendship through adversity.

27:13.582 --> 27:16.083
In fact, all you see around you
has been taken

27:16.167 --> 27:19.503
from the lessons garnered
from the historical documents.

27:19.588 --> 27:22.423
Is this a spaceship?

27:22.507 --> 27:26.135
No, this is a star port for the ship.

27:27.220 --> 27:29.763
Would you guys like to see the ship?

27:52.162 --> 27:53.912
Oh, my God!

27:59.878 --> 28:01.211
It's real.

28:10.680 --> 28:12.765
The generator room.

28:12.849 --> 28:16.143
The beryllium sphere, of course.

28:16.227 --> 28:20.064
And as we continue,
the medical quarters are to the left.

28:20.148 --> 28:23.275
We went to some trouble duplicating
your cellular regeneration system...

28:23.360 --> 28:25.194
- Jason, what have you got us into?
- What the hell is going on?

28:25.278 --> 28:27.821
- What are we doing here?
- Wow, the floors are so clean.

28:27.906 --> 28:30.741
We're just here to negotiate
this guy Sarris' surrender.

28:30.825 --> 28:31.909
It's no big deal.

28:31.993 --> 28:35.996
And the organ fabrication chamber
is coming along nicely.

28:36.081 --> 28:41.001
No big deal? Are you crazy?
We have to get out of here.

28:41.086 --> 28:44.630
- Come on, guys.
- Jason, we're actors, not astronauts.

28:44.714 --> 28:47.508
You guys want to go home?
You say the word, we'll go home.

28:47.592 --> 28:49.843
Pay our bills, feed our fish,

28:49.928 --> 28:54.431
fall asleep in front of the TV
and miss out on all this.

28:54.516 --> 28:56.975
Come on.
Do you guys want to do that? Anybody?

28:57.060 --> 29:00.562
Gwen, come on, think about it.
Look at where we are. We're in space.

29:00.647 --> 29:04.525
Alexander, this is the role of a lifetime.
You guys want to leave?

29:04.609 --> 29:08.529
We have enjoyed preparing
many of your esoteric dishes.

29:08.613 --> 29:12.950
Your Monte Cristo sandwich is
a current favorite of the adventurous.

29:13.034 --> 29:14.702
The main barracks.

29:27.966 --> 29:29.174
At ease.

29:33.972 --> 29:36.640
It's like throwing gasoline on a flame.

29:40.603 --> 29:42.062
What?

29:42.147 --> 29:45.107
I'm just jazzed about
being on the show, man.

29:52.157 --> 29:54.783
If you would all take your positions.

29:55.744 --> 29:57.286
Our what?

29:57.370 --> 29:58.495
Guys.

30:01.624 --> 30:02.833
Oh, my!

30:08.882 --> 30:10.549
Look, this thingy.

30:12.677 --> 30:15.387
I remember I had it all worked out.

30:16.347 --> 30:18.724
This is forward. This is back.

30:20.643 --> 30:22.728
Commander, some of
the crew has requested

30:22.812 --> 30:25.397
to be present at this historic event.

30:26.691 --> 30:28.358
Sure. Bring them in.

30:44.334 --> 30:47.503
No pressure, huh?
I'm glad I ain't the Commander.

30:49.005 --> 30:50.756
Laredo, take us out.

30:53.259 --> 30:54.593
Excuse me?

30:56.638 --> 30:59.723
They designed those controls
after watching you.

31:00.892 --> 31:04.520
- Take her out.
- Right, right.

31:05.647 --> 31:07.397
Okay. Right.

31:09.943 --> 31:12.569
Right. Take her out.

32:15.216 --> 32:18.051
Okay, you got to move to the right.
Move more to the right.

32:18.136 --> 32:22.389
Would you sit your ass down? Sit!
Move! You want to drive this thing?

33:14.776 --> 33:16.985
How are you enjoying
your steak, Commander?

33:17.070 --> 33:20.822
I'm really enjoying it.
This is like corn-fed lowa beef.

33:20.907 --> 33:24.284
Yes, we programmed the food
synthesizer for each of you

33:24.369 --> 33:26.828
based on the regional menu
of your birthplace.

33:26.913 --> 33:30.248
I don't care where you did it,
it tastes great.

33:30.333 --> 33:33.126
Are you enjoying your Kep-mok
blood ticks, Dr. Lazarus?

33:33.211 --> 33:35.462
Just like Mother used to make.

33:39.884 --> 33:42.678
So, tell me, Mathesar,

33:42.762 --> 33:46.056
this Sarris person
that we're flying to meet,

33:46.140 --> 33:47.975
what does he want?

33:48.059 --> 33:51.561
He heard about the device,
the Omega 13.

33:52.730 --> 33:55.023
What is it? What does it do?

33:55.108 --> 33:57.150
We don't know.

33:57.235 --> 33:59.903
We were hoping you could enlighten us.

34:06.786 --> 34:08.578
The Omega 13 device.

34:09.621 --> 34:13.833
We found that on an alien planet.
We don't know what it does either.

34:13.918 --> 34:17.212
Why don't you just turn it on
and see what it does?

34:18.339 --> 34:22.592
It has at its heart a reactor
capable of unthinkable energy.

34:22.677 --> 34:24.469
If we were mistaken in our construction,

34:24.554 --> 34:28.098
the device would act as a molecular
explosive, causing a chain reaction

34:28.181 --> 34:31.351
that would obliterate
all matter in the universe.

34:32.145 --> 34:35.688
Has Sarris ever seen
any of the historical records?

34:35.773 --> 34:37.774
No, thank God, he has not.

34:39.527 --> 34:42.529
So how does he know
about the Omega 13 device?

34:46.826 --> 34:51.121
Our former commander was not strong.

34:51.956 --> 34:53.623
Former commander?

34:55.001 --> 34:58.420
I am sorry. You deserve to be shown.

34:58.504 --> 35:02.049
The tape was smuggled off
of Sarris' ship.

35:02.133 --> 35:04.843
Originally, one of our own tried to lead.

35:04.927 --> 35:06.511
Is that all?

35:06.596 --> 35:11.933
After three days of this,
you still require incentive?

35:14.812 --> 35:16.730
I have told you all I know.

35:16.814 --> 35:19.691
If you have any mercy within you,
please, let me die.

35:19.776 --> 35:24.404
When I grow weary of
the noises you make, you shall die.

35:38.044 --> 35:39.878
Hey, guys, come on, hold on a minute.

35:39.962 --> 35:42.047
You just can't leave.
Give me some time to think.

35:42.131 --> 35:43.090
- Think.
- He wants to think.

35:43.174 --> 35:45.592
No, Jason. That's a wrap.
There's nothing to think about!

35:45.676 --> 35:46.760
I'm not even supposed to be here.

35:46.844 --> 35:48.887
I'm just crewman number six.
I'm expendable.

35:48.971 --> 35:51.598
I'm the guy in the episode who dies
to prove the situation is serious.

35:51.682 --> 35:52.808
I got to get out of here.

35:52.892 --> 35:54.601
Commander! Commander?

35:54.685 --> 35:57.270
We got to prepare
the pods for my crew's departure.

35:57.355 --> 35:58.939
But begging your
Commander's pardon, sir,

35:59.023 --> 36:00.607
we can't launch pods at the moment.

36:00.691 --> 36:03.235
Sarris will surely detonate
any objects leaving the ship.

36:03.319 --> 36:05.153
- Sarris?
- Yes, sir. He's here now.

36:05.238 --> 36:08.240
Your presence is required
on the command deck.

36:16.707 --> 36:18.125
There's nobody here.

36:18.209 --> 36:20.961
While my people are talented scientists,

36:21.045 --> 36:22.921
our attempt to operate
our own technologies

36:23.005 --> 36:26.299
under tactical simulation
have been disastrous.

36:26.384 --> 36:28.677
I have raised Sarris on Zeta frequency.

36:28.761 --> 36:32.097
- Mathesar...
- We meet again, Commander.

36:32.181 --> 36:35.934
Hello, Sarris. How you doing?

36:36.018 --> 36:38.061
Better than my lieutenant.

36:39.522 --> 36:42.482
He failed to activate
the ship's neutron armor

36:42.567 --> 36:46.278
as quickly as I'd hoped
on our last encounter.

36:46.362 --> 36:48.321
Yeah, well, you know, I'd like to say

36:48.406 --> 36:50.031
I'm real sorry about
what happened before.

36:50.116 --> 36:53.618
The whole thing was just
a misunderstanding.

36:53.703 --> 36:58.748
Deliver the device to me,
or I will destroy your ship!

37:00.042 --> 37:02.502
You know, we'd like to do that,

37:02.587 --> 37:06.047
but frankly, Sarris, sir, we don't know
what it is or even where it is.

37:06.132 --> 37:08.800
You have 10 seconds!

37:08.885 --> 37:11.678
I don't... Ten seconds? I don't... There...

37:11.762 --> 37:15.849
You know, okay. Gosh darn it, I give up.
It's yours. You can have it.

37:15.933 --> 37:19.519
You have to give me a minute
to put it in a box for you, okay?

37:19.604 --> 37:20.687
Gwen.

37:22.273 --> 37:24.566
Don't panic.
I've dealt with this guy before.

37:24.650 --> 37:26.109
He's as stupid as he is ugly.

37:26.194 --> 37:27.235
- Come here.
- Jason.

37:27.320 --> 37:28.528
Not now, Gwen.

37:28.613 --> 37:30.447
- No!
- Sit, sit, sit, sit, sit.

37:30.531 --> 37:32.365
We're gonna send everything
we can at him, all right?

37:32.450 --> 37:34.409
- Jason.
- Not now, Gwen!

37:34.493 --> 37:36.453
Push these red buttons and
send everything we have towards him.

37:36.537 --> 37:38.246
- Okay?
- Okay.

37:38.331 --> 37:41.875
All right, Gwen,
put me back on with him.

37:41.959 --> 37:45.795
Well, I'm trying to tell you,
you are back on.

37:45.880 --> 37:50.050
Perhaps I'm not as stupid
as I am ugly, Commander!

37:52.011 --> 37:58.058
I gave you the "kill" gesture.

37:58.142 --> 38:01.478
Yeah. No, you gave me the "we're dead"
signal. I was agreeing with you.

38:01.562 --> 38:05.565
- Like I know where the hold button is.
- Hey, you guys.

38:05.650 --> 38:09.236
There's a red thingy

38:09.320 --> 38:12.280
- moving toward the green thingy.
- What?

38:12.365 --> 38:16.451
Red thingy moving toward
the green thingy.

38:16.535 --> 38:19.746
I think we're the green thingy.

38:19.830 --> 38:23.083
A little present for you, Commander.

38:23.167 --> 38:24.751
We got to get out of here!
Move the ship! Turn it! Move it! Go!

38:26.963 --> 38:28.380
Oh, no!

38:31.217 --> 38:32.634
Oh, my God!

38:42.728 --> 38:43.853
Tommy, Tommy, let's go!

38:43.938 --> 38:44.980
- Get us out of here!
- Jason, what do I do?

38:45.064 --> 38:47.023
- Let's go! Go, go, go!
- What do I do?

39:00.037 --> 39:02.455
They're turning. They're coming!

39:07.586 --> 39:10.213
Thrust ahead, full!

39:11.340 --> 39:13.800
Fire at will.

39:17.054 --> 39:20.432
- Go faster, Tommy!
- I'm going as fast as I can, Jason!

39:20.516 --> 39:22.475
She's still behind us!

39:22.560 --> 39:24.227
Well, press "turbo."

39:24.312 --> 39:25.687
I've always said,
"Press the turbo," right?

39:25.771 --> 39:29.691
- It's right here! Right here!
- Well, press it and hold it down!

39:34.572 --> 39:36.906
The enemy is matching velocity.

39:36.991 --> 39:40.618
- Enemy is matching velocity.
- We heard it the first time!

39:40.703 --> 39:43.955
Gosh, I'm doing it.
I'm repeating the darn computer.

39:44.040 --> 39:46.666
Hi, guys. Listen,

39:46.751 --> 39:52.505
they're telling me
the generators won't take it.

39:52.590 --> 39:57.802
The ship is breaking apart and all that.
Just FYI.

39:57.887 --> 40:00.513
- We've got to stop!
- We stop and we die.

40:00.598 --> 40:03.308
- Tommy, just hold that thing down!
- You cannot hold the turbo down!

40:03.392 --> 40:05.769
- It's for quick boosts!
- Like you know!

40:11.442 --> 40:14.652
I remember that sound.
That's a bad sound.

40:14.737 --> 40:18.948
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait! We might
be able to lose them in this cloud here.

40:19.033 --> 40:22.160
- I don't think that's a cloud.
- Mathesar, what is it?

40:22.244 --> 40:26.706
This is the Tothian minefield left
standing from the great war of 12185.

40:32.588 --> 40:33.838
Oh, God!

40:45.601 --> 40:50.814
Could you possibly try
not to hit every single one?

40:50.898 --> 40:54.984
Sorry, man, they're drifting towards us.
I think they're magnetic!

40:59.657 --> 41:01.533
Continue forward, sir?

41:02.868 --> 41:04.661
Patience, Lieutenant.

41:06.539 --> 41:07.831
Patience.

41:17.800 --> 41:20.552
- We've got to stop!
- We're almost through this.

41:41.365 --> 41:44.117
- You okay? You all right?
- Yeah.

41:44.201 --> 41:46.703
Everybody all right? Where's Tommy?

41:48.205 --> 41:49.998
- Tommy! You all right?
- Oh, man!

41:50.082 --> 41:53.668
No, my arm is broke.
Don't touch it! Don't touch it!

41:54.211 --> 41:57.672
- I'll take him to medical quarters.
- Thanks, Mathesar.

42:04.889 --> 42:07.307
Alex, where are you going?

42:07.391 --> 42:09.350
To see if there's a pub!

42:19.069 --> 42:22.572
Forward thruster shaft, 87% damage.

42:22.656 --> 42:25.533
Aft vector guards, 96% damage.

42:26.327 --> 42:30.955
Structural breaches
in quadrants 32, 34, 40...

42:31.040 --> 42:36.002
- What about the engines?
- Forward thruster shaft, 87% damage.

42:36.086 --> 42:40.048
Computer, what about the engines?
Why don't we have power?

42:40.132 --> 42:43.259
The beryllium sphere
has fractured under stress.

42:44.136 --> 42:45.678
It's fractured.

42:46.764 --> 42:48.515
Can it be repaired?

42:48.599 --> 42:50.725
Computer, can it be repaired?

42:50.809 --> 42:53.686
Damage to
beryllium sphere irreparable.

42:53.771 --> 42:56.189
New source of beryllium
must be secured.

42:56.273 --> 42:57.857
We need another one.

42:57.942 --> 43:00.944
You broke the ship.
You broke the bloody ship!

43:02.404 --> 43:11.037
Computer, is there a replacement
beryllium sphere on board?

43:11.121 --> 43:15.917
Negative. No reserve
beryllium sphere exists on board.

43:16.001 --> 43:19.712
No, we have no extra
beryllium sphere on board.

43:19.797 --> 43:22.090
You know, that is
really getting annoying!

43:22.174 --> 43:24.926
Look, I have one job on this lousy ship.

43:25.010 --> 43:28.555
It's stupid, but I'm gonna do it, okay?

43:28.639 --> 43:30.306
Sure, no problem.

43:36.981 --> 43:41.234
A thousand apologies.
We have failed you.

43:41.318 --> 43:43.236
How have you failed us?

43:43.320 --> 43:48.032
We have seen you victorious
in much more desperate situations.

43:48.117 --> 43:51.619
The fault must lie with us, with the ship.

43:51.704 --> 43:55.206
No, Mathesar, it is not your fault,
and it's not the ship's fault.

43:55.291 --> 43:59.043
It's my fault. We screwed...

43:59.128 --> 44:02.630
We are not the people you think we are.

44:02.715 --> 44:04.465
I don't understand.

44:10.014 --> 44:15.310
Didn't you make any TV shows
on your planet? Any theater? Films?

44:15.394 --> 44:18.771
The historical documents
of your culture. Yes, in fact,

44:18.856 --> 44:22.108
we have begun to document
our history from your example.

44:22.192 --> 44:25.987
No, not historical documents.
They're not all historical documents.

44:26.071 --> 44:29.866
I mean, surely you don't think
that Gilligan's Island is a...

44:31.744 --> 44:33.411
Those poor people.

44:34.872 --> 44:36.247
Oh, brother.

44:38.250 --> 44:39.792
We're screwed.

44:41.337 --> 44:44.756
Is there no one on your planet
who behaves in a way

44:44.840 --> 44:47.175
that's contrary to reality?

44:48.719 --> 44:51.137
You are speaking of...

44:51.221 --> 44:53.931
- Deception, lies.
- Deception, lies.

44:54.016 --> 44:56.976
We have only recently
become aware of this concept

44:57.061 --> 44:59.020
in our dealings with Sarris.

44:59.104 --> 45:02.065
Often, Sarris will say
one thing and do another.

45:02.149 --> 45:04.817
Promise us mercy,
but deliver destruction.

45:04.902 --> 45:08.905
It is a concept we are beginning
to learn at some great cost.

45:08.989 --> 45:11.032
But if you are saying that any of you

45:11.116 --> 45:13.910
could have traits
in common with Sarris...

45:23.337 --> 45:28.841
Hey, Commander, listen. We found
some beryllium on a nearby planet.

45:28.926 --> 45:35.390
And we might be able to get there
if we reconfigure the solar matrix

45:35.474 --> 45:38.685
in parallel for endothermic propulsion.

45:38.769 --> 45:40.436
What do you think?

45:44.608 --> 45:46.693
- We'll do that!
- All right!

45:48.404 --> 45:52.615
That's right again. That's...
Come on, group hug. Come on.

46:05.504 --> 46:08.923
Dr. Lazarus, I hope
I am not breaching protocol,

46:09.007 --> 46:13.177
but I am so very humbled
to stand in your presence.

46:13.262 --> 46:15.805
I have studied
your missions extensively.

46:15.889 --> 46:19.225
Though I am Thermian,
I have lived my life by your philosophy,

46:19.309 --> 46:21.310
by the code of the Mak'tar.

46:21.395 --> 46:24.647
Good, that's very nice.

46:24.732 --> 46:26.566
By Grabthar's hammer, Dr. Lazarus...

46:26.650 --> 46:29.569
- Don't do that. I'm not kidding.
- I'm sorry, sir, I was only...

46:29.653 --> 46:30.987
Just don't.

46:33.323 --> 46:34.615
Yes, sir.

46:44.501 --> 46:46.836
Never give up. Never surrender.

46:54.136 --> 46:57.305
Dr. Lazarus?
Here is your surface mapper.

46:57.389 --> 46:59.932
I have programmed it
to the coordinates of a beryllium sphere

47:00.017 --> 47:02.643
of sufficient density.

47:02.728 --> 47:05.062
Good luck on your mission, sir.

47:06.690 --> 47:07.815
Thanks.

47:16.825 --> 47:18.826
You're doing good, Tommy.

47:24.500 --> 47:27.335
I changed my mind. I want to go back.

47:27.419 --> 47:30.505
After the fuss you made
about getting left behind?

47:30.589 --> 47:33.466
Yeah, but that's when I thought I was
the crewman that stays on the ship

47:33.550 --> 47:35.802
and something is up there
then it kills me.

47:35.886 --> 47:38.054
But now I'm thinking I'm the guy
who gets killed by some monster

47:38.138 --> 47:39.931
five minutes after we land on the planet!

47:40.015 --> 47:42.058
You're not gonna die on the planet, Guy.

47:42.142 --> 47:44.811
I'm not? Then what's my last name?

47:44.895 --> 47:47.980
It's... I don't know.

47:48.065 --> 47:50.817
Nobody knows! Do you know why?

47:50.901 --> 47:53.653
Because my character isn't important
enough for a last name.

47:53.737 --> 47:56.322
Because I'm gonna die five minutes in.

47:56.406 --> 47:59.242
Guy, you have a last name.

47:59.326 --> 48:02.537
- Do I? Do I?
- Yes!

48:02.621 --> 48:06.958
For all you know,
I'm just crewman number six.

48:07.042 --> 48:11.087
Mommy! Mommy! Mommy!

48:11.171 --> 48:12.588
Are we there yet?

48:12.673 --> 48:15.383
- Mommy!
- Tommy!

48:15.467 --> 48:18.344
- Look out!
- Oh, no! Pull out!

48:18.428 --> 48:20.054
Oh, yeah!

48:20.138 --> 48:23.307
Come on. Oh, boy! Come on.

48:38.991 --> 48:41.909
Hey! Don't open that!
It's an alien planet!

48:41.994 --> 48:44.328
Is there air? You don't know!

48:51.628 --> 48:53.004
Seems okay.

49:08.312 --> 49:09.645
Here we go.

49:14.735 --> 49:16.527
Which way, Alexander?

49:23.035 --> 49:24.327
This way!

49:26.163 --> 49:27.663
Wait. No.

49:32.753 --> 49:34.170
That way.

49:34.254 --> 49:36.422
- You were holding it upside down.
- Shut up.

49:36.506 --> 49:37.715
You know,
with all that makeup and stuff,

49:37.799 --> 49:39.634
I actually thought
you were smart for a second.

49:39.718 --> 49:41.636
You think you could do better, Laredo?

49:41.720 --> 49:44.931
- All right with that Laredo stuff.
- We're screwed. We're so screwed.

49:45.015 --> 49:46.807
Come on, come on, come on.
If we want to finish this mission,

49:46.892 --> 49:48.351
we have to use some self-control.

49:48.435 --> 49:51.437
Self-control?
That's funny coming from a guy

49:51.521 --> 49:54.815
who slept with every Terrakian slave girl
and moon princess on the show.

49:54.900 --> 49:56.692
Did it ever occur to you,
had you been more supportive

49:56.777 --> 49:58.861
we might have been able...

49:59.780 --> 50:03.866
Wow. Must be
some sort of mining facility.

50:04.785 --> 50:06.535
Where are the miners?

50:07.371 --> 50:10.373
- Something bad happened here.
- Will you relax?

50:14.086 --> 50:18.339
There they are.
Beryllium spheres. Let's go.

50:45.742 --> 50:48.369
Look at that. Would you look at that?

50:50.455 --> 50:52.748
They look like little children.

50:54.251 --> 50:56.502
Could they be the miners?

50:56.586 --> 50:59.672
Sure, they're like, three years old.

51:02.592 --> 51:04.885
Miners, not minors!

51:04.970 --> 51:07.054
- You lost me.
- I don't like this.

51:07.139 --> 51:10.516
- I don't like this at all.
- They are so cute.

51:10.600 --> 51:14.478
Sure, they're cute now, but in a second,
they're gonna get mean.

51:14.563 --> 51:16.063
They're gonna get ugly somehow,

51:16.148 --> 51:19.150
then there's gonna be
a million more of them.

51:19.234 --> 51:22.111
Look. There's a little hurt one.

51:31.455 --> 51:33.706
Hi. Hi there.

51:36.126 --> 51:38.544
Did you guys ever watch the show?

51:41.673 --> 51:44.967
See? They're gonna help
the little hurt one.

51:53.810 --> 51:56.312
I'm so sick of being right.

51:56.396 --> 51:58.522
Let's get out of here
before one of those things kills Guy.

51:58.607 --> 52:01.609
Wait a minute! We're not going
anywhere without a beryllium sphere.

52:01.693 --> 52:03.652
We need a plan.
Fred, I need a diversion

52:03.737 --> 52:05.446
to clear the compound of those things.

52:05.530 --> 52:07.823
Then, Alex and Gwen and I
will go get a sphere.

52:07.908 --> 52:08.949
Tommy, get up on that ridge.

52:09.034 --> 52:11.077
If you see them come back
give me a signal, all right?

52:11.161 --> 52:12.870
Why does this sound so familiar?

52:12.954 --> 52:15.581
"Assault on Voltareck III," episode 81.

52:15.665 --> 52:18.417
- We're doing episode 81?
- Whatever. The one with the hologram.

52:18.502 --> 52:20.669
- The wall of fire.
- Well, how the hell is Fred

52:20.754 --> 52:22.588
supposed to project a hologram?

52:22.672 --> 52:25.424
- Are we doing episode 81?
- It's just a rough plan, Guy.

52:25.509 --> 52:27.426
What difference does it make
if it's episode 81 or not?

52:27.511 --> 52:29.970
'Cause I died in episode 81.

52:30.055 --> 52:31.472
- Episode 51, right?
- 51. 51.

52:31.556 --> 52:34.600
This is ludicrous.
Why are you listening to this fellow?

52:34.684 --> 52:38.104
May I remind you he's wearing
a costume, not a uniform.

52:38.188 --> 52:42.024
He's no more equipped to lead us
than this fellow. No offense.

52:43.777 --> 52:45.444
Look, they're gone.

52:45.529 --> 52:47.905
- Where'd they go? Back inside?
- I don't know.

52:47.989 --> 52:50.032
Nobody was watching?

52:50.117 --> 52:51.742
All right, all right. Listen up.
Here's the plan.

52:51.827 --> 52:53.911
Gwen, Fred, Alex and I
will go down and get a sphere.

52:53.995 --> 52:55.830
Fleegman, you set up a perimeter
and Tommy, you're lookout.

52:55.914 --> 52:58.249
You see anything at all,
you give us a signal, all right?

52:58.333 --> 52:59.625
What kind of a signal?

52:59.709 --> 53:03.170
- Any kind of signal.
- Okay, I'll do my hands like this.

53:04.422 --> 53:07.383
What are you, an infant?
Look, we have these.

53:09.845 --> 53:11.846
That. Sorry.

53:12.389 --> 53:13.681
Let's go.

53:20.230 --> 53:23.899
- Does the rolling help actually?
- It helps.

53:23.984 --> 53:26.652
- Where's your gun?
- It helps.

53:35.829 --> 53:36.954
What?

53:39.499 --> 53:41.250
Never give up. Never surrender.

53:41.334 --> 53:43.169
- Oh, shut up.
- Oh, shut up.

53:44.462 --> 53:47.173
Jason! They're coming!
There's thousands of them, Jason!

53:47.257 --> 53:50.593
Run, Jason! Run!
They're coming! They're everywhere!

53:51.761 --> 53:54.346
- They're everywhere!
- Jason, they're everywhere!

53:54.431 --> 53:57.183
- They're everywhere!
- Come on, let's go!

53:57.267 --> 54:00.352
- They're coming!
- Hurry!

54:02.522 --> 54:05.774
- They're everywhere! Come on!
- Oh, God! Oh, God!

54:05.859 --> 54:08.027
Don't look back. Do not look back!

54:08.111 --> 54:10.571
- Oh, God.
- We're not gonna make it!

54:12.407 --> 54:13.741
Oh, God!

54:13.825 --> 54:17.620
I knew it, I knew it!
I knew this was gonna kill me!

54:17.704 --> 54:21.457
Go, go, go! Come on! Push it harder!
Let's go, Tommy!

54:21.541 --> 54:23.709
I got it but it's gonna
take a few seconds.

54:23.793 --> 54:25.336
I got it, I got it!

54:25.420 --> 54:27.046
- Oh, yeah!
- Go ahead.

54:27.130 --> 54:28.547
There's no time. Get in! Get in!

54:28.632 --> 54:30.716
Come on. I've forgotten you've got
to be the hero, haven't you?

54:30.800 --> 54:35.387
Heaven forbid anybody else gets
the spotlight! Oh, no! Jason Nesmith...

54:35.472 --> 54:38.015
Jason! Jason, come on! Hurry!

54:38.099 --> 54:41.227
- I'm on it!
- Tommy, go! Go! I'm in!

54:41.311 --> 54:44.146
No, no, no! Jason, please!

54:44.231 --> 54:48.067
- Tommy, stop the pod! He's not in!
- But I can't stop it, it's on autopilot!

54:48.151 --> 54:49.777
- Go! Leave him!
- No!

55:00.997 --> 55:02.831
Oh, right!

55:02.916 --> 55:05.834
Of course, it's always about you, isn't it?

55:41.579 --> 55:46.667
- Gorignak! Gorignak!
- Gorignak! Gorignak!

55:48.378 --> 55:51.755
Jason? Jason, can you hear me?

55:51.840 --> 55:53.757
Yeah, Gwen, you got me.

55:53.842 --> 55:55.968
- Thank God. Are you okay?
- Yeah.

55:56.052 --> 55:59.722
As a matter of fact, I have Gorignak
staring me in the face right now.

55:59.806 --> 56:03.058
But you know what?
I think I can take him.

56:05.061 --> 56:08.147
Jason, we're gonna use the digital
conveyor to get you out of there.

56:08.231 --> 56:10.024
- The digital conveyor?
- Yes.

56:10.108 --> 56:12.609
You mean
I'm gonna be diced into cubes

56:12.694 --> 56:14.486
and sent up there in a million pieces?

56:14.571 --> 56:17.531
- Right.
- Well, you know what?

56:17.615 --> 56:20.409
I think I'll take my chance
with Gorignak.

56:21.494 --> 56:25.331
We're getting you out right now.
It's perfectly safe, isn't it, Teb?

56:25.415 --> 56:27.666
It has never been successfully tested.

56:27.751 --> 56:30.919
- What did he say?
- Hold, please.

56:31.004 --> 56:33.380
Theoretically the mechanism
is fully operational.

56:33.465 --> 56:37.259
However it was built to accommodate
your anatomy, not ours.

56:37.344 --> 56:39.845
But now that Tech Sergeant Chen
is here, he can operate it.

56:39.929 --> 56:44.266
It was designed watching his motions
from the historical documents.

56:44.351 --> 56:47.519
I mean, I can't. I can supervise...

56:47.604 --> 56:49.396
Jason, we're gonna test it.

56:49.481 --> 56:52.399
- On what?
- How about that pig lizard?

56:52.484 --> 56:54.318
Hey, I'm doing all right
with the pig lizard.

56:54.402 --> 56:56.445
Please, Fred? And hurry.

57:00.158 --> 57:03.619
I'm sorry. It's very exciting
to watch the master at the controls.

57:03.703 --> 57:07.039
The operation of the conveyor is
much more art than science.

57:07.123 --> 57:08.791
Stand back, Jason.

57:34.150 --> 57:36.527
What? What was that?

57:36.611 --> 57:38.779
- Nothing.
- I hear some squealing or something.

57:38.863 --> 57:42.741
- Oh, no. Everything's fine.
- But the animal is inside out.

57:42.826 --> 57:45.327
I heard that. It turned inside out?

57:49.165 --> 57:51.083
And it exploded.

57:51.167 --> 57:55.796
Did I just hear that that animal
turned inside out and then it exploded?

57:55.880 --> 57:57.047
Hello?

57:59.509 --> 58:01.009
Hold, please.

58:01.845 --> 58:03.595
Hey, wait a minute, guys, guys.

58:03.680 --> 58:06.640
If the pig lizard is gone,
why are they still yelling "Gorignak"?

58:06.724 --> 58:09.143
Teb, hit the translation circuit.

58:11.938 --> 58:16.024
- Rock, rock, rock, rock!
- Rock, rock, rock, rock!

58:18.945 --> 58:22.865
Jason, I don't think
the pig lizard was Gorignak.

58:23.283 --> 58:25.659
What the hell you talking about?

58:35.044 --> 58:36.336
Oh, darn.

58:48.308 --> 58:49.725
Digitize me!

58:50.143 --> 58:51.477
- Come on, Fred.
- Come on, guys. Digitize me!

58:51.561 --> 58:52.978
- Oh, no, not me.
- Come on, they...

58:53.062 --> 58:54.480
They based it on your hand movements.

58:54.564 --> 58:56.023
Am I the only one
who saw that thing inside out?

58:56.107 --> 58:58.400
- No, no, no.
- I'm not the guy.

58:58.485 --> 59:00.152
I'm not Tech Sergeant Chen,
I'm Fred Kwan.

59:00.236 --> 59:02.154
I'm not even...
Kwan's not even my real name.

59:02.238 --> 59:04.406
Fred's no good, Jason.
You're just gonna have to kill it.

59:04.491 --> 59:08.327
Kill it?
Well, I'm open to any suggestions.

59:08.411 --> 59:11.163
Go for the eyes, like in episode 22!

59:11.247 --> 59:12.915
It doesn't have any eyes, Tommy.

59:12.999 --> 59:15.876
Go for the mouth or the throat,
its vulnerable spots!

59:15.960 --> 59:18.795
It's a rock.
It doesn't have any vulnerable spots!

59:18.880 --> 59:22.174
I know! You construct a weapon.
Look around you.

59:22.258 --> 59:24.760
Can you form some sort of
rudimentary lathe?

59:24.844 --> 59:27.095
A lathe! Get off the line, Guy!

59:27.180 --> 59:29.097
Alexander, you're my advisor.
Advise me!

59:29.182 --> 59:32.142
Well, you're just gonna have to
figure out what it wants.

59:32.227 --> 59:34.186
What is its motivation?

59:35.063 --> 59:37.981
It's a rock monster.
It doesn't have motivation.

59:38.066 --> 59:42.444
See, that's your problem, Jason.
You were never serious about the craft.

59:43.238 --> 59:46.406
Fred! Fred, can you hear me?
Fred, are you there?

59:47.534 --> 59:49.952
- Kind of.
- You can do it, Fred! It's up to you!

59:50.036 --> 59:53.247
Oh, no, no, no.
Jason, I'll just... I'll just mess it up.

59:53.331 --> 59:55.624
You did it for four years on the show!
Do it now!

59:55.708 --> 59:58.502
That was the show. I'm not that guy!

59:58.586 --> 01:00:02.047
Fred, you never forgot a line!
You never missed a mark!

01:00:02.799 --> 01:00:04.633
That's not me anymore man.

01:00:07.512 --> 01:00:10.305
It is you, Fred. You just stopped trying.

01:00:12.225 --> 01:00:15.269
You can do this, Fred! I know
in my heart you're gonna save my life.

01:00:15.353 --> 01:00:18.438
- I am?
- No doubt about it, Fred.

01:00:19.357 --> 01:00:20.482
Fred!

01:00:21.818 --> 01:00:23.652
Fred, can you hear me?

01:00:25.280 --> 01:00:26.363
Fred!

01:00:27.991 --> 01:00:30.701
Fred? I don't want to die down here.

01:00:31.661 --> 01:00:33.328
Digitize me, Fred!

01:00:37.375 --> 01:00:38.625
Oh, wow.

01:00:39.586 --> 01:00:41.628
- Tech Sergeant Chen.
- Yeah!

01:00:49.220 --> 01:00:52.014
I see you managed to get your shirt off.

01:00:55.852 --> 01:00:58.645
- I did it.
- Welcome back, Fred.

01:00:59.647 --> 01:01:02.149
All right, did we get
the beryllium sphere installed?

01:01:02.233 --> 01:01:06.278
- Yes, we are back to full power.
- Great! Engines and pods?

01:01:06.362 --> 01:01:08.280
- Fully operational.
- Perfect!

01:01:08.364 --> 01:01:10.449
Well, crank this sucker up,
you could drop us off

01:01:10.533 --> 01:01:12.909
and you guys can be back in
your home planet before supper.

01:01:12.994 --> 01:01:15.329
Oh, no, sir,
we have no reason to go back.

01:01:15.413 --> 01:01:17.789
Sure you do. Family, friends. Come on!

01:01:17.874 --> 01:01:19.875
We are all that is left.

01:01:26.424 --> 01:01:30.177
- I didn't know that.
- Sir, I have raised the command deck.

01:01:34.140 --> 01:01:37.643
Mathesar, meet us
up at the command deck.

01:01:37.727 --> 01:01:38.894
Mathesar.

01:01:40.605 --> 01:01:43.148
Mathesar! Quellek!

01:01:44.067 --> 01:01:46.068
Why can't we reach them?

01:02:06.798 --> 01:02:10.300
Commander. Thank God you're alive.

01:02:11.386 --> 01:02:15.472
Now you will face justice, Sarris.

01:02:15.556 --> 01:02:20.811
At every turn, you demonstrate
the necessity for your extermination!

01:02:20.895 --> 01:02:22.479
Leave him alone.

01:02:24.982 --> 01:02:27.984
You wish to save the life of this man?

01:02:28.069 --> 01:02:29.569
Yeah. Yes.

01:02:32.949 --> 01:02:37.869
Then tell me, what does it do,
this Omega 13?

01:02:37.954 --> 01:02:39.955
I don't know what it does.

01:02:43.668 --> 01:02:45.460
I said I don't know!

01:02:48.715 --> 01:02:51.383
- Is it a bomb?
- I don't know.

01:02:51.467 --> 01:02:54.344
- A booby trap?
- I don't know!

01:02:54.429 --> 01:02:56.471
- Tell me!
- I don't know!

01:02:57.890 --> 01:02:59.891
Do you think I'm a fool?

01:02:59.976 --> 01:03:04.187
That the Commander does not know
every bolt, every weld in his ship?

01:03:06.357 --> 01:03:08.525
Prepare a tear harness

01:03:09.736 --> 01:03:11.278
for the female.

01:03:12.447 --> 01:03:14.990
No! Gwen, no!

01:03:15.825 --> 01:03:17.784
You brute! Let go of me!

01:03:18.953 --> 01:03:21.079
I'm not the Commander.

01:03:21.164 --> 01:03:22.914
What did you say?

01:03:22.999 --> 01:03:25.333
I said, "I'm not the Commander."

01:03:26.085 --> 01:03:28.962
Leave them alone.
There's no reason to hurt them.

01:03:29.046 --> 01:03:31.548
- They don't know anything.
- Explain.

01:03:32.759 --> 01:03:36.344
Gwen, show him
the historical documents.

01:03:38.765 --> 01:03:40.265
Computer,

01:03:40.349 --> 01:03:44.394
show the historical documents
of the Galaxy Quest missions.

01:04:10.630 --> 01:04:11.963
Wonderful.

01:04:15.218 --> 01:04:20.222
You have all done far greater damage
than I ever could have.

01:04:21.557 --> 01:04:22.849
Bravo!

01:04:24.185 --> 01:04:25.477
Bravo.

01:04:25.937 --> 01:04:28.688
This is a moment I will treasure.

01:04:28.773 --> 01:04:33.109
Explain to him who you all really are.

01:04:35.738 --> 01:04:36.988
Tell him!

01:04:39.742 --> 01:04:40.951
Explain!

01:04:45.122 --> 01:04:49.751
Mathesar, there's no such person
as Captain Taggart.

01:04:50.419 --> 01:04:54.714
My name is Jason Nesmith.
I am an actor.

01:04:56.843 --> 01:04:58.510
We're all actors.

01:04:59.345 --> 01:05:01.596
He doesn't understand.

01:05:03.099 --> 01:05:06.476
Explain as you would a child.

01:05:10.022 --> 01:05:12.983
We pretended.

01:05:18.614 --> 01:05:19.948
We lied.

01:05:21.784 --> 01:05:26.288
Yes! You understand that,
don't you, Mathesar?

01:05:26.747 --> 01:05:29.708
Mathesar, I'm not a commander. I...

01:05:30.585 --> 01:05:34.713
There's no National Space
Exploration Administration.

01:05:34.797 --> 01:05:37.215
We don't have a ship.

01:05:37.300 --> 01:05:39.009
But there it is.

01:05:43.222 --> 01:05:45.098
That ship is that big.

01:05:45.182 --> 01:05:48.226
But inside, I see many rooms.

01:05:48.311 --> 01:05:52.022
You've seen plywood sets
that look like the inside.

01:05:52.106 --> 01:05:56.860
Our beryllium sphere is wire
with plaster around it.

01:05:57.612 --> 01:05:58.987
And our...

01:06:00.406 --> 01:06:02.490
Our digital conveyor is...

01:06:04.577 --> 01:06:06.077
...Christmas tree lights.

01:06:06.162 --> 01:06:08.538
It's a decoration. It's all fake.

01:06:11.375 --> 01:06:12.876
Just like me.

01:06:16.297 --> 01:06:18.715
But why?

01:06:21.594 --> 01:06:23.678
It's difficult to explain.

01:06:25.181 --> 01:06:27.015
On our planet, we...

01:06:29.685 --> 01:06:34.105
We pretend to entertain and...

01:06:36.525 --> 01:06:41.029
Mathesar, I am so sorry.
God, I am so sorry.

01:06:43.532 --> 01:06:45.158
So now you know.

01:06:46.035 --> 01:06:51.206
Lieutenant Lathe,
hardwire the reactor core to overload.

01:06:51.290 --> 01:06:55.251
I would like to blow
this troublesome vehicle to dust.

01:06:55.336 --> 01:06:57.587
Sarris, what about my people?

01:06:57.672 --> 01:07:01.549
Yes, far too simple a death for them,
isn't it?

01:07:01.634 --> 01:07:05.887
Lathe, open an oxygen seal on level C.

01:07:05.972 --> 01:07:09.015
Let the air in a bit for our friends.

01:07:10.184 --> 01:07:11.559
Son of a...

01:07:17.233 --> 01:07:19.192
Release them

01:07:19.276 --> 01:07:20.694
into space.

01:07:23.656 --> 01:07:27.367
Core overload.
Emergency shutdown overridden.

01:07:27.994 --> 01:07:30.954
Core implosion
estimated in nine minutes.

01:07:32.498 --> 01:07:36.167
Core overload.
Emergency shutdown overridden.

01:07:36.252 --> 01:07:37.335
Hey!

01:07:37.420 --> 01:07:39.671
Core implosion
estimated in nine minutes.

01:07:39.755 --> 01:07:42.132
Where's the happy ending, Jason?

01:07:43.259 --> 01:07:45.677
"Never give up. Never surrender."

01:07:51.934 --> 01:07:55.061
Maybe it's about time
you just backed off,

01:07:55.146 --> 01:07:57.522
you fin-headed monstrosity.

01:07:57.606 --> 01:07:58.815
Jason.

01:07:59.442 --> 01:08:00.567
You what?

01:08:00.651 --> 01:08:04.154
You're starting to act
like you did in episode 17,

01:08:04.905 --> 01:08:06.906
you scene-stealing hack.

01:08:09.493 --> 01:08:11.161
Oh, right!

01:08:12.621 --> 01:08:17.917
Well, how does it feel, Jason?
Was it worth it? You've murdered us all!

01:08:18.002 --> 01:08:20.837
- Shut up.
- Hundreds to die just because of you!

01:08:20.921 --> 01:08:22.796
- I told you to shut up!
- Both of you, get in there.

01:08:22.881 --> 01:08:24.215
Hundreds to die,

01:08:24.300 --> 01:08:27.926
just because you want to play
at being commander, you raving lunatic.

01:08:28.011 --> 01:08:30.095
Then I'll see you in hell, won't I?

01:08:43.611 --> 01:08:45.236
Look out, Jason!

01:08:45.821 --> 01:08:47.822
Get his gun! Get the gun!

01:08:49.116 --> 01:08:50.492
Take that!

01:09:05.508 --> 01:09:08.051
Sorry... The door's a little sticky.
Did you see that?

01:09:08.135 --> 01:09:11.429
I'll get one of my boys up here
with a can of WD-40.

01:09:15.017 --> 01:09:18.310
- You used to pull your punches.
- Scene-stealing hack? Thank you.

01:09:18.395 --> 01:09:19.938
- Raving egomaniac?
- Wonder where I got that from?

01:09:20.022 --> 01:09:21.439
Hey, guys.

01:09:23.192 --> 01:09:24.359
Look.

01:09:28.488 --> 01:09:30.281
They're suffocating.

01:09:35.537 --> 01:09:39.541
Core overload.
Emergency shutdown overridden.

01:09:40.126 --> 01:09:42.961
Core implosion
estimated in eight minutes.

01:09:45.714 --> 01:09:48.966
General, your transport
is ready for departure.

01:09:54.098 --> 01:09:58.017
Core overload.
Emergency shutdown overridden.

01:09:58.727 --> 01:10:02.230
Core implosion
estimated in seven minutes.

01:10:03.941 --> 01:10:07.152
- Computer, shut down the core.
- Unable.

01:10:07.236 --> 01:10:12.448
Memory checksum invalid.
Core systems hardware damaged.

01:10:12.533 --> 01:10:14.450
All right, all right, listen up.
This is what we gotta do.

01:10:14.535 --> 01:10:17.078
Gwen, you and I, we're gonna get to
the core and shut it down manually.

01:10:17.163 --> 01:10:19.956
Fred, take Guy and Laliari.
You find that valve, shut it off,

01:10:20.040 --> 01:10:21.374
before those Thermians run out of air.

01:10:21.458 --> 01:10:22.709
Alexander, get to the barracks,

01:10:22.793 --> 01:10:24.669
see if you can't wedge a door open
in case they can't do that.

01:10:24.753 --> 01:10:26.462
- Okay.
- Wait, Jason. What about me?

01:10:26.547 --> 01:10:27.589
What do I do?

01:10:27.673 --> 01:10:30.425
You're gonna practice driving. Let's go!

01:10:32.011 --> 01:10:33.219
Practice driving.

01:10:33.929 --> 01:10:36.014
So we get to shut down
a neutron reactor?

01:10:36.098 --> 01:10:38.433
- That's right.
- Well, I hate to break it to you, Jason,

01:10:38.517 --> 01:10:41.436
but I don't know
how to shut down a neutron reactor,

01:10:41.520 --> 01:10:43.938
and unless you took a Learning Annex
course I don't know about,

01:10:44.023 --> 01:10:46.774
I'm pretty sure you don't know how
to shut down a neutron reactor, either.

01:10:46.859 --> 01:10:50.028
No, I don't,
but I know someone who does.

01:10:54.491 --> 01:10:56.784
Brandon, honey, the garbage.

01:10:56.869 --> 01:10:58.870
Mother, I'm quite busy.

01:10:58.954 --> 01:11:02.248
Come on, Brandon,
don't make me ask you again.

01:11:02.333 --> 01:11:05.168
Just 10 more minutes, okay, Ma?
I promise.

01:11:19.642 --> 01:11:21.643
Hello? Anybody there?

01:11:23.812 --> 01:11:27.815
Hello?

01:11:28.484 --> 01:11:31.819
Got him. Listen to me.
This is Jason Nesmith.

01:11:32.071 --> 01:11:36.241
I play Commander Peter Quincy
Taggart, NSEA Protector.

01:11:36.325 --> 01:11:40.328
We accidentally traded voxes the other
day when we bumped into each other.

01:11:42.706 --> 01:11:46.084
Commander, I see. Okay.

01:11:46.168 --> 01:11:48.044
What's your name, son?

01:11:49.505 --> 01:11:50.588
Brandon.

01:11:50.673 --> 01:11:53.591
Brandon, I remember you.
From the convention, right?

01:11:53.676 --> 01:11:57.011
You asked all those little
technical questions about the ship,

01:11:57.096 --> 01:11:59.180
and I was a little short with you.

01:11:59.265 --> 01:12:03.768
Yes, yes, I know, Commander,
and I actually wanna...

01:12:03.852 --> 01:12:06.521
I just wanted to tell you that
I thought a lot about what you said...

01:12:06.605 --> 01:12:09.274
- It's okay. Now, listen.
- But I want you to know

01:12:09.358 --> 01:12:12.068
that I'm not
a complete brain case, okay?

01:12:13.028 --> 01:12:15.947
I understand completely
that it's just a TV show.

01:12:16.031 --> 01:12:18.449
- Hold... Wait a minute...
- I know there's no beryllium sphere...

01:12:18.534 --> 01:12:21.327
- Stop. Stop for a second. Stop. Wait.
...no digital conveyor, no ship.

01:12:21.412 --> 01:12:22.745
It's all real.

01:12:22.830 --> 01:12:25.748
Oh, my God, I knew it.
I knew it! I knew it!

01:12:26.583 --> 01:12:29.794
The crew and I are in a lot of trouble
and we need your help.

01:12:31.005 --> 01:12:34.966
Core overload.
Emergency shutdown overridden.

01:12:35.759 --> 01:12:39.137
Core implosion
estimated in six minutes.

01:12:42.099 --> 01:12:44.434
Sir, it's you. Thank lpthar.

01:12:46.395 --> 01:12:49.272
Quellek? What are you doing up there?

01:12:51.900 --> 01:12:55.320
I avoided capture
by using your Mak'tar stealth haze.

01:12:56.071 --> 01:12:57.655
Where is everyone?

01:12:57.740 --> 01:13:00.575
Come with me. I'll explain on the way.

01:13:03.871 --> 01:13:07.415
All right, we're at level C, hallway five.
Now what?

01:13:07.499 --> 01:13:11.044
Go to weapons storage,
your second left, through the passage.

01:13:11.128 --> 01:13:13.087
Now, that leads to
a system of utility corridors

01:13:13.172 --> 01:13:14.297
through the bowels of the ship.

01:13:14.381 --> 01:13:17.091
- Open.
- You know what? I'm gonna get Kyle.

01:13:17.176 --> 01:13:19.927
He knows the utility tunnel system
better than anybody alive.

01:13:22.181 --> 01:13:23.723
38, 39, 40.

01:13:26.101 --> 01:13:30.688
All right. All we have to do
is turn off the valve to the barracks.

01:13:35.778 --> 01:13:36.736
Hi, Brandon.

01:13:36.820 --> 01:13:40.156
No time for pleasantries, Kyle.
We have a level 5 emergency.

01:13:40.240 --> 01:13:42.450
You've still got the utility systems
walk-through, right?

01:13:42.534 --> 01:13:45.912
Yeah, I've got sectors one through 28.
I think Hollister has the upper levels.

01:13:45.996 --> 01:13:47.955
Great, we'll get everybody online.

01:13:56.131 --> 01:14:00.218
- Pedal to the metal, Commander.
- Pedal to the metal, Commander.

01:14:03.013 --> 01:14:06.557
General! I have just received word
that the commander of the Protector

01:14:06.642 --> 01:14:09.477
and his command crew
have escaped custody.

01:14:10.396 --> 01:14:11.521
What?

01:14:14.566 --> 01:14:15.942
Find them!

01:14:16.026 --> 01:14:19.612
But, sir! My men...
The core implosion is not reversible.

01:14:19.696 --> 01:14:21.989
Find them!

01:14:23.826 --> 01:14:25.743
All right, Brandon,
I see five ducts in this room.

01:14:25.828 --> 01:14:27.203
Which way do we go?

01:14:27.287 --> 01:14:32.417
Enter the passage second to your left,
and just continue straight for 50 meters.

01:14:32.501 --> 01:14:34.961
Ducts? Why is it always ducts?

01:14:35.045 --> 01:14:37.296
There will be a slight drop.

01:14:45.180 --> 01:14:48.433
Thanks for the heads-up, Brandon!
You okay?

01:14:54.731 --> 01:14:56.357
They're dying.

01:14:56.442 --> 01:14:58.443
Wait a minute.
We gotta go across this thing?

01:14:58.527 --> 01:15:00.445
- Yes.
- Don't look down.

01:15:00.529 --> 01:15:03.030
Commander, what I'd give
to see what you're seeing.

01:15:03.115 --> 01:15:04.115
What are you talking about?

01:15:04.199 --> 01:15:07.034
You're deep in the underbelly
of the Omega 13!

01:15:07.119 --> 01:15:08.953
It must be spectacular.

01:15:09.037 --> 01:15:14.041
Well, it doesn't look like much to me.
Just these few walls

01:15:14.126 --> 01:15:17.795
and this dumb spinning fan
that we have in every single...

01:15:32.144 --> 01:15:35.605
Brandon, what does
the Omega 13 device do?

01:15:36.398 --> 01:15:39.775
Many have believed
that it is a matter-collapser.

01:15:39.860 --> 01:15:43.905
A bomb capable of destroying pretty
much everything in about 13 seconds.

01:15:43.989 --> 01:15:49.452
But myself and others are convinced
that what it is is a matter-rearranger,

01:15:49.536 --> 01:15:52.288
effecting a 13-second time jump
to the past.

01:15:52.372 --> 01:15:53.331
Why 13 seconds?

01:15:53.415 --> 01:15:57.251
That's really not enough time
to do anything of any importance.

01:15:57.336 --> 01:16:00.505
- It'd be time to redeem a single mistake.
- What?

01:16:04.092 --> 01:16:05.092
Come on! Go, go, go, go!

01:16:06.094 --> 01:16:10.181
Fleeg, we gotta turn off that valve.
Their oxygen's almost gone.

01:16:10.265 --> 01:16:14.602
Listen, I'll go in. I'll create a distraction.
I got this. I'm okay,

01:16:14.686 --> 01:16:17.980
I might be able to hold them back
long enough for the aliens to escape.

01:16:18.065 --> 01:16:19.232
That's suicide.

01:16:19.316 --> 01:16:22.360
I'm just a glorified extra, Fred.
I'm a dead man anyway.

01:16:22.444 --> 01:16:25.196
If I'm gonna die,
I'd rather go out a hero than a coward.

01:16:25.280 --> 01:16:29.450
Guy, Guy,
maybe you're the plucky comic relief.

01:16:29.952 --> 01:16:32.036
You ever think about that?

01:16:32.621 --> 01:16:34.205
- Plucky?
- Well, besides,

01:16:34.289 --> 01:16:37.083
I just had this really interesting idea.

01:16:38.460 --> 01:16:40.002
Are you stoned?

01:16:41.630 --> 01:16:44.715
Gotta get it open, give them some time.

01:16:44.800 --> 01:16:46.467
Sir, perhaps together,

01:16:46.552 --> 01:16:49.720
the Mak'tar chant of strength,
"Larak tarath."

01:16:50.138 --> 01:16:52.974
- Larak tarath, larak tarath.
- Larak tarath.

01:16:53.058 --> 01:16:58.145
- Larak tarath, larak tarath, larak tarath!
- Larak tarath, larak tarath, larak tarath!

01:17:06.488 --> 01:17:08.447
All right, Brandon, we're across.
Now what?

01:17:08.532 --> 01:17:12.785
You want to take a left and then just
straight on through the chompers.

01:17:12.869 --> 01:17:14.453
"The chompers"?

01:17:19.918 --> 01:17:21.419
Well, screw that.

01:17:21.503 --> 01:17:23.254
How are we supposed
to get through this?

01:17:23.338 --> 01:17:25.298
Hollister, do you have
the sequence yet?

01:17:25.382 --> 01:17:30.344
Okay, the sequence is 2242...

01:17:30.429 --> 01:17:32.346
- What is this thing?
...2242...

01:17:32.431 --> 01:17:34.098
I mean, there's no useful purpose
for there to be

01:17:34.182 --> 01:17:36.601
a bunch of chompy-crushy
things in the middle of a hallway!

01:17:36.685 --> 01:17:39.228
- Gwen! Gwen!
- No, I think we shouldn't have to do this.

01:17:39.313 --> 01:17:41.772
It makes no logical sense!
Why is it here?

01:17:41.857 --> 01:17:43.899
- 'Cause it's on the television show!
- Well, forget it!

01:17:43.984 --> 01:17:47.612
I am not doing it!
This episode was badly written!

01:17:47.696 --> 01:17:50.781
Okay, Commander, now,
as soon as the first crusher hits you...

01:17:50.866 --> 01:17:51.907
It just did!

01:17:51.992 --> 01:17:54.201
- Okay, go now.
- Go!

01:17:54.828 --> 01:17:55.870
Go!

01:17:56.163 --> 01:17:57.288
Stop!

01:17:57.372 --> 01:17:58.372
Go!

01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:02.043
Come on, come on, come on.

01:18:04.713 --> 01:18:08.549
Go!

01:18:08.759 --> 01:18:09.925
Go! Go!

01:18:10.010 --> 01:18:11.469
No, stop! Stop!

01:18:11.553 --> 01:18:12.762
Go!

01:18:12.846 --> 01:18:14.305
Stop! Wait a minute! No!

01:18:14.389 --> 01:18:17.350
I want you to jump, Commander, jump!

01:18:17.434 --> 01:18:20.061
Whoever wrote this episode should die!

01:18:22.397 --> 01:18:24.523
This should be interesting.

01:18:44.628 --> 01:18:47.546
It's the simple things
in life you treasure.

01:18:50.133 --> 01:18:51.634
That's great.

01:18:53.720 --> 01:18:55.554
Now, we better get...

01:19:00.852 --> 01:19:02.978
Hey, get a room, guys, okay?

01:19:10.779 --> 01:19:15.700
Hey, Fred.

01:19:20.622 --> 01:19:22.289
That's not right.

01:19:51.778 --> 01:19:54.321
Sir, the pressure, it's normalizing.

01:19:56.533 --> 01:19:57.908
Open!

01:20:00.787 --> 01:20:02.621
We are saved.

01:20:02.706 --> 01:20:04.915
He has saved us.

01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:08.419
Commander Taggart has saved us!

01:20:13.800 --> 01:20:15.551
It's just not fair.

01:20:17.763 --> 01:20:21.265
All right, Quellek,
let's get back to the command deck.

01:20:24.936 --> 01:20:26.562
I'm... I'm shot.

01:20:42.704 --> 01:20:44.455
Quellek? Quellek?

01:20:51.296 --> 01:20:52.963
It's not too bad.

01:20:53.715 --> 01:20:56.967
We'll get you to the medical quarters
and you'll be fine.

01:20:57.052 --> 01:21:00.095
It has been my greatest honor
to serve with you.

01:21:00.180 --> 01:21:02.556
I have been blessed, sir. I...

01:21:03.683 --> 01:21:05.518
Don't speak, Quellek.

01:21:10.148 --> 01:21:12.399
You'll forgive my impertinence, sir,

01:21:12.484 --> 01:21:14.902
but even though
we had never before met,

01:21:14.986 --> 01:21:17.822
I always considered you
as a father to me.

01:21:21.576 --> 01:21:22.910
Quellek,

01:21:25.580 --> 01:21:27.414
by Grabthar's hammer,

01:21:28.542 --> 01:21:31.001
by the sons of Warvan,

01:21:32.420 --> 01:21:36.423
you shall be avenged.

01:22:14.337 --> 01:22:17.298
13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19!

01:22:17.924 --> 01:22:19.884
All right, Brandon, I'm here.
How do I shut this thing down?

01:22:19.968 --> 01:22:21.552
Okay, just push the blue button.

01:22:21.636 --> 01:22:24.388
- The blue button? Is that it?
- Yeah, why, what's wrong?

01:22:24.472 --> 01:22:28.183
Nothing, I just thought
it'd be more complicated than that.

01:22:29.060 --> 01:22:32.855
Core implosion estimated
in 20 seconds.

01:22:42.532 --> 01:22:45.618
Brandon, it's not working. Brandon!

01:22:48.246 --> 01:22:50.456
Mother, I cannot stress enough
the severity

01:22:50.540 --> 01:22:54.001
- of the Commander's predicament.
- Don't forget the recyclables!

01:22:54.502 --> 01:22:58.297
Core implosion
estimated in 10 seconds.

01:22:59.341 --> 01:23:01.550
- 9,8...
- Gwen, I...

01:23:01.635 --> 01:23:03.469
...7,6...
- I've always...

01:23:03.553 --> 01:23:06.263
...5,4...
- Jason, Jason.

01:23:06.348 --> 01:23:09.183
...3,2,1.

01:23:19.069 --> 01:23:21.570
It always stops at one on the show.

01:23:22.447 --> 01:23:24.198
What were you saying?

01:23:24.783 --> 01:23:26.158
- Sir!
- What?

01:23:26.493 --> 01:23:29.370
The core detonation sequence
on the Protector has been aborted.

01:23:29.454 --> 01:23:31.830
Impossible! Lmpossible!

01:23:32.457 --> 01:23:36.377
Lock a complement of implosion
missiles onto the Protector.

01:23:36.461 --> 01:23:38.879
Tear her apart!

01:23:48.765 --> 01:23:49.974
He's finished, he's finished.

01:23:50.058 --> 01:23:53.560
Alexander, listen to me.
It's okay, it's okay.

01:23:54.062 --> 01:23:57.773
The Thermians can handle it from here.
We gotta go. Come on.

01:23:59.526 --> 01:24:01.276
We need that armor back up!

01:24:01.361 --> 01:24:05.572
- Get me a forward view right now!
- Plasma armor engaged.

01:24:07.283 --> 01:24:09.493
All right, Tommy, see if you can't
lose them in that minefield.

01:24:09.577 --> 01:24:12.037
- Minefield?
- Pedal to the metal, right now!

01:24:12.122 --> 01:24:14.331
- Pedal to the metal!
- All right, let's go!

01:24:24.384 --> 01:24:26.719
Good going, Tommy. Great going.

01:24:27.095 --> 01:24:29.221
Thrust ahead, full!

01:24:29.973 --> 01:24:32.349
Into the field, go!

01:24:38.606 --> 01:24:41.942
Tommy, can you get us closer
to these mines?

01:24:42.027 --> 01:24:43.277
Closer?

01:24:47.657 --> 01:24:48.782
I could try.

01:24:54.372 --> 01:24:56.874
General, I've lost them.

01:24:57.542 --> 01:25:01.378
The magnetism of the minefield
is disrupting our instruments.

01:25:02.130 --> 01:25:04.631
Wait! I see something.

01:25:05.717 --> 01:25:08.552
Yes. Yes! There they are.

01:25:08.636 --> 01:25:11.138
- Get back on their tail.
- I can't, sir.

01:25:11.222 --> 01:25:14.725
- What? Why not?
- Because they're coming right at us.

01:25:15.393 --> 01:25:16.894
Fire at will.

01:25:22.984 --> 01:25:26.070
We're getting hammered, Jason!
Return fire?

01:25:26.154 --> 01:25:29.073
No! Divert all energy to the armor!

01:25:29.157 --> 01:25:30.657
How adorable!

01:25:31.284 --> 01:25:34.328
The actors
are going to play war with me.

01:25:34.412 --> 01:25:37.414
Sarris' ship accelerating toward us
at mark two.

01:25:37.499 --> 01:25:39.208
Accelerate to mark four.

01:25:43.546 --> 01:25:46.507
Let me remind you, sonny,

01:25:47.258 --> 01:25:49.510
I am a general.

01:25:50.345 --> 01:25:56.225
If you are counting on me to blink,
then you are making a deadly mistake.

01:25:57.685 --> 01:25:59.937
Well, let me tell you something, Sarris.

01:26:00.021 --> 01:26:03.440
It doesn't take a great actor
to recognize a bad one.

01:26:03.858 --> 01:26:05.609
You're sweating!

01:26:05.693 --> 01:26:07.611
Armor almost gone, Jason!

01:26:07.695 --> 01:26:12.866
You fool! You fail to realize
that with your armor gone,

01:26:12.951 --> 01:26:17.079
my ship will tear through yours
like tissue paper.

01:26:18.164 --> 01:26:22.251
And what you fail to realize is
my ship is dragging mines.

01:26:25.046 --> 01:26:27.589
Oh, no! Turn, turn!

01:26:44.190 --> 01:26:45.482
- Yes!
- Yes!

01:26:47.735 --> 01:26:50.863
Yes! Yes! Yes!

01:26:52.907 --> 01:26:54.741
This is fantastic!

01:27:00.456 --> 01:27:01.748
Mathesar!

01:27:03.084 --> 01:27:05.127
Oh, my God, you're alive.

01:27:06.421 --> 01:27:07.462
Come here.

01:27:07.547 --> 01:27:11.049
"The ship was a model as big as this."

01:27:11.759 --> 01:27:14.303
A very clever deception indeed.

01:27:24.606 --> 01:27:26.231
Set a course for home, Commander?

01:27:26.316 --> 01:27:28.984
- Can you do that?
- Yeah, it's just point and click.

01:27:29.068 --> 01:27:31.028
But we're going to have to go through
the black hole, though.

01:27:31.112 --> 01:27:32.696
Any objections?

01:27:33.615 --> 01:27:35.657
All right, set her up.

01:27:40.288 --> 01:27:42.456
What's the matter, Mathesar?

01:27:43.833 --> 01:27:46.460
We were hoping
you could come with us.

01:27:47.212 --> 01:27:50.297
My people have no commander.

01:27:52.050 --> 01:27:56.136
Mathesar, I think your people
have a great commander,

01:27:57.222 --> 01:27:58.305
sir.

01:28:06.481 --> 01:28:09.483
All right, Tommy,
take us into the black hole.

01:28:25.250 --> 01:28:27.918
- We're out!
- We're going home!

01:28:28.002 --> 01:28:29.962
Systems register functional.

01:28:30.046 --> 01:28:32.047
All systems are working, Commander.

01:28:32.131 --> 01:28:33.966
Jason, before the black hole,

01:28:34.050 --> 01:28:36.426
there was an energy surge
from Sarris' ship.

01:28:36.511 --> 01:28:39.429
Let's not worry about that
right now, Alexander.

01:28:39.514 --> 01:28:42.349
Fred, what are you doing up here?
Shouldn't you be downstairs until we...

01:28:42.433 --> 01:28:46.019
Hey, you know,
you could put an eye out with that thing.

01:28:49.023 --> 01:28:50.148
Fred?

01:29:06.124 --> 01:29:07.207
No!

01:29:32.650 --> 01:29:33.942
Mathesar!

01:29:34.986 --> 01:29:36.903
Activate the Omega 13!

01:30:01.179 --> 01:30:03.930
- We're out!
- We're going home!

01:30:05.183 --> 01:30:07.309
Systems register functional.

01:30:07.393 --> 01:30:09.353
All systems are working, Commander.

01:30:09.437 --> 01:30:11.313
Jason, before the black hole,

01:30:11.397 --> 01:30:14.274
there was
an energy surge from Sarris' ship.

01:30:15.985 --> 01:30:20.072
Jason, what are you doing?
What are you doing?

01:30:21.282 --> 01:30:23.533
Let go of me. Let... It's not Fred!

01:30:23.618 --> 01:30:25.535
That's Sarris. Listen to me!

01:30:25.620 --> 01:30:27.954
I'm telling you, it's not Fred,
that's Sarris!

01:30:28.039 --> 01:30:30.457
He's gonna try to kill all of us!

01:30:38.966 --> 01:30:41.301
Never give up. Never surrender.

01:30:42.804 --> 01:30:46.223
Jason! Jason! I can't slow it down!

01:30:46.307 --> 01:30:49.101
Our ship is too big
to enter the atmosphere.

01:30:49.185 --> 01:30:51.645
We need to separate, or we'll die.

01:30:56.275 --> 01:30:59.820
We gotta do it.
It's our only hope, Mathesar. Thank you.

01:31:00.988 --> 01:31:03.156
Crew to the secondary deck.

01:31:05.159 --> 01:31:06.451
Mathesar!

01:31:10.748 --> 01:31:12.541
Goodbye, my friends.

01:31:18.548 --> 01:31:21.675
Fred, get up to command deck.
We're separating.

01:31:47.201 --> 01:31:49.536
On, Teb, on!

01:31:57.211 --> 01:31:59.087
This is the third day of the Galaxy Con,

01:31:59.172 --> 01:32:03.884
and Jason Nesmith and his entire crew
are no-shows here at the big event,

01:32:03.968 --> 01:32:06.845
much to the disappointment
of all these fans.

01:32:06.929 --> 01:32:08.263
Bye. Be back soon!

01:32:08.347 --> 01:32:11.641
Well... Wait. Brandon, where are you
going with all those fireworks?

01:32:11.726 --> 01:32:14.728
The Protectorgot super-accelerated
coming out of the black hole

01:32:14.812 --> 01:32:17.022
and it's, like, nailed the atmosphere
at mark 15,

01:32:17.106 --> 01:32:20.150
which, you guys know,
is pretty unstable, obviously,

01:32:20.234 --> 01:32:23.403
so we're gonna help Laredo guide it
on the vox ultra-frequency carrier

01:32:23.488 --> 01:32:26.698
and use Roman candles
for visual confirmation.

01:32:26.782 --> 01:32:28.950
All right, dinner's at 7:00.

01:32:32.079 --> 01:32:33.872
Well, he's outside.

01:34:02.878 --> 01:34:06.047
Lieutenant Laredo, Tommy Webber!

01:34:08.676 --> 01:34:10.010
Hi, Tommy!

01:34:12.096 --> 01:34:15.515
The beautiful Tawny Madison,
Gwen DeMarco!

01:34:17.143 --> 01:34:20.395
Yes!

01:34:21.480 --> 01:34:23.189
Wow, what effects!

01:34:23.983 --> 01:34:28.153
Another shipmate!
Yes, the more, the merrier!

01:34:29.864 --> 01:34:34.159
The ship's Tech Sergeant Chen,
Fred Kwan, and a friend.

01:34:35.161 --> 01:34:39.456
Dr. Lazarus, Alexander Dane!

01:34:39.707 --> 01:34:43.209
Give him a big hand. He's British!
Yes, sir!

01:34:44.045 --> 01:34:48.548
Commander Peter Quincy Taggart,
Jason Nesmith!

01:34:58.392 --> 01:35:00.060
Great driving, Tommy.

01:35:00.144 --> 01:35:01.895
Yes! Yes!

01:35:09.820 --> 01:35:12.280
Quick, quick! Go, go! Move, move!

01:35:19.455 --> 01:35:23.500
Once again,
Commander Peter Quincy Taggart,

01:35:23.584 --> 01:35:25.293
Mr. Jason Nesmith!

01:35:27.922 --> 01:35:33.051
Come on, give it up for the crew,
the NSEA Protector!

01:35:34.303 --> 01:35:36.680
True love! Yes!

01:35:38.849 --> 01:35:39.933
Wow!

01:35:41.644 --> 01:35:42.936
Come on!

01:35:45.981 --> 01:35:48.566
They're here for you, folks. Come on!

01:35:49.193 --> 01:35:50.610
What a show!

01:35:52.321 --> 01:35:53.988
What a show! Yes!

01:35:56.992 --> 01:36:00.036
Yes! Give it up! Wow!

01:36:02.540 --> 01:36:04.999
Come on, give it up! Give it all up

01:36:05.084 --> 01:36:09.421
for the crew of your favorite show,
Galaxy Quest! Wow!
