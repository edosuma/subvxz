<i>BECKETT: Elizabeth.</i>

00:30.229 --> 00:32.997
- Yes, Carson?
<i>- He's awake.</i>

00:39.840 --> 00:41.645
<i>BECKETT: Blood pressure's fine.
Pulse, normal.</i>

00:41.650 --> 00:43.375
You're bouncing back quite nicely.

00:43.443 --> 00:46.207
- Bouncing back from what?
- Hello, Michael.

00:46.446 --> 00:47.941
Do you remember me?

00:50.417 --> 00:51.406
No.

00:51.585 --> 00:55.077
I'm Dr. Elizabeth Weir.
This is Lieutenant Colonel John Sheppard.

00:55.188 --> 00:57.247
You serve under my command.

00:59.726 --> 01:01.617
Do you know where you are?

01:03.029 --> 01:05.087
I don't even know who I am.

01:05.565 --> 01:08.261
Your name is
Lieutenant Michael Kenmore.

01:09.135 --> 01:12.732
You're in a private room
off the infirmary here in Atlantis.

01:14.074 --> 01:16.008
Is that familiar to you?

01:17.777 --> 01:19.105
Atlantis?

01:20.647 --> 01:23.179
Yeah, I think.

01:24.150 --> 01:26.985
You're a member of a team
that went off-world.

01:27.187 --> 01:29.385
You were captured by the Wraith.

01:31.825 --> 01:34.020
I see you remember the Wraith.

01:35.395 --> 01:37.160
What did they do to me?

01:37.530 --> 01:39.598
We're not quite sure yet.

01:39.866 --> 01:42.027
We sent a rescue team for you,

01:43.036 --> 01:45.736
but you were wounded
during the mission.

01:45.839 --> 01:48.765
You've been unconscious for days now,
had us worried sick.

01:48.975 --> 01:52.506
- Why can't I remember anything?
- We don't know yet.

01:52.712 --> 01:55.442
Hopefully, we'll learn more
as we conduct further tests.

01:55.548 --> 01:57.807
And in the meantime,
I can assure you

01:57.817 --> 02:01.710
that we will give you the best
possible care to help in your recovery.

02:10.830 --> 02:12.630
Keep a close eye on him.

02:12.732 --> 02:15.826
Until we know more,
we need to proceed with caution.

02:16.036 --> 02:18.834
This may just be
the start of our problems.

03:31.244 --> 03:32.877
What is that?

03:35.849 --> 03:37.976
I'm afraid you have Type I diabetes.

03:38.084 --> 03:42.544
You require a daily injection of insulin
to maintain a normal blood glucose level.

03:42.689 --> 03:45.385
You've managed it quite nicely, actually.

03:47.327 --> 03:48.888
Michael, we believe
you may be suffering

03:48.928 --> 03:51.658
from what's called
generalized dissociative amnesia,

03:52.132 --> 03:55.693
which usually occurs
as a result of significant trauma.

03:55.802 --> 03:57.895
Trauma caused by the Wraith?

03:59.205 --> 04:00.934
We don't know for certain.

04:01.041 --> 04:03.942
Hopefully, over time,
your memory will return.

04:04.110 --> 04:06.908
In the meantime, we'll do our best
to help you fill in the gaps

04:07.013 --> 04:10.608
a wee bit at a time
so as not to completely overwhelm you.

04:11.251 --> 04:13.719
I'm already completely overwhelmed.

04:14.020 --> 04:16.113
How much worse could it get?

04:23.329 --> 04:24.762
I heard he was awake.

04:24.864 --> 04:27.662
Aye, complete amnesia.
Doesn't remember a thing.

04:32.939 --> 04:34.702
May I speak with him?

04:34.974 --> 04:36.271
Of course.

04:39.612 --> 04:41.204
You need to rest.

04:50.557 --> 04:52.047
Hello, Michael.

04:52.725 --> 04:54.056
I am Teyla.

04:55.829 --> 04:57.456
You look familiar.

04:58.131 --> 04:59.860
- Do I know you?
- Yes.

05:01.201 --> 05:03.863
You assisted my team
on a few missions.

05:05.138 --> 05:07.106
No, there's more, though.

05:08.942 --> 05:11.502
- Are we friends?
- Yes.

05:13.213 --> 05:16.182
That's the best news
I've heard all day.

05:18.151 --> 05:19.880
How are you feeling?

05:20.386 --> 05:22.684
Physically fine, but my mind

05:23.756 --> 05:25.485
is completely blank.

05:25.859 --> 05:27.918
They said I'm a lieutenant.

05:28.528 --> 05:31.019
You have only recently arrived in Atlantis,

05:31.197 --> 05:32.822
but you have already
proven yourself

05:32.825 --> 05:34.665
to be one of the finest soldiers
in this city.

05:34.667 --> 05:38.535
Well, if I'm such a fine soldier,
how did I get captured by the Wraith?

05:38.638 --> 05:42.074
Your team came upon a landed
Wraith cruiser and were ambushed.

05:42.242 --> 05:45.905
You sacrificed yourself in order
to give your teammates time to escape.

05:46.012 --> 05:47.445
<i>Quite heroic.</i>

05:49.916 --> 05:52.680
Were you part of the team
that rescued me?

05:52.785 --> 05:53.809
Yes.

05:54.420 --> 05:57.218
Well, then, that makes you
even more heroic.

05:59.893 --> 06:02.020
He said I was familiar to him.

06:02.128 --> 06:03.686
He asked if we were friends.

06:03.796 --> 06:06.356
- How did you respond?
- I said we were.

06:06.499 --> 06:07.693
After everything he's been through,

06:07.800 --> 06:10.098
I thought
some positive news could not hurt.

06:10.203 --> 06:11.431
I think you're right.

06:11.538 --> 06:15.531
Stabilization is the first critical stage
in his psychological treatment.

06:15.642 --> 06:17.109
He's doing quite well so far,

06:17.210 --> 06:20.611
but it's important we do what we can
to ease his recovery.

06:20.713 --> 06:22.613
What's the next stage?

06:22.715 --> 06:26.549
Integration into the community
followed by relational development.

06:26.653 --> 06:30.145
- How is he doing physically?
- Excellent. Vitals, normal.

06:30.356 --> 06:34.417
All he needs is a bit of physical therapy
to regain muscle tone and coordination.

06:34.527 --> 06:36.654
- Do you think he's ready
to be released? - I do.

06:36.763 --> 06:39.357
I don't think that's such a good idea.

06:39.599 --> 06:41.679
We still don't know
if there are any residual effects

06:41.734 --> 06:43.861
he might be carrying around.

06:44.904 --> 06:47.873
What do you think, Doctor?
Is he ready to join the community?

06:47.974 --> 06:51.239
A change of scenery
could be very beneficial to him.

06:55.748 --> 06:57.909
All right, then. Release him.

07:12.765 --> 07:14.790
These are your quarters.

07:17.704 --> 07:20.229
<i>TEYLA: Does any of this
look familiar to you?</i>

07:20.340 --> 07:21.534
<i>MICHAEL: No.</i>

07:28.081 --> 07:29.776
It is a cowboy hat.

07:31.417 --> 07:33.885
You come from a place called Texas.

07:34.821 --> 07:35.947
Texas?

07:51.070 --> 07:52.833
<i>They're your parents.</i>

08:01.114 --> 08:02.411
(PEOPLE CHATTERING)

08:02.515 --> 08:04.915
Hey, what happened to the blue Jell-O?
My favorite?

08:05.018 --> 08:08.078
All of a sudden it's off the menu.
What gives?

08:08.521 --> 08:09.818
Thank you.

08:20.500 --> 08:22.195
Lieutenant Kenmore.

08:22.635 --> 08:24.466
Well, so they tell me.

08:24.937 --> 08:28.600
- Call me Michael.
- Michael, right. Yes, of course, Michael.

08:30.910 --> 08:33.344
I'm sorry.
I'm probably supposed to know you, but...

08:33.446 --> 08:37.212
Right. Right, the amnesia.
Yes, of course, I heard. I'm Dr. McKay.

08:37.683 --> 08:39.811
- Rodney McKay.
- Doctor.

08:42.288 --> 08:45.052
So, you've been released, I see.

08:45.992 --> 08:47.254
Just now.

08:48.194 --> 08:51.279
I have some bodyguards
following me around everywhere,

08:51.289 --> 08:54.520
and Colonel Sheppard's
probably somewhere close by.

08:54.826 --> 08:58.091
They wanna keep an eye on me
in case I suddenly, you know,

08:58.196 --> 09:00.661
- freak out.
- Yes, freak out. Yes.

09:00.675 --> 09:03.020
Well, but I don't think you're...
I mean, you're not gonna...

09:03.030 --> 09:04.991
You're fine, aren't you?

09:05.069 --> 09:07.003
I think so. I feel fine.

09:07.372 --> 09:08.839
I guess time will tell.

09:08.940 --> 09:11.636
Hopefully the amnesia
won't be permanent.

09:14.279 --> 09:16.543
Wraith materializer schematics?

09:17.415 --> 09:19.383
Yes. Yes. I was

09:20.418 --> 09:22.579
just studying them, you know.

09:23.454 --> 09:24.719
How did I know that?

09:24.822 --> 09:26.507
One of your team's mission objectives

09:26.524 --> 09:29.979
was to infiltrate a Wraith ship

09:29.994 --> 09:32.519
and obtain, you know,

09:34.365 --> 09:35.798
intelligence.

09:36.267 --> 09:38.735
- And our mission was successful?
- Yes. Very successful.

09:38.836 --> 09:40.929
Except for getting captured.

09:41.072 --> 09:43.233
Well, we've all been captured
by the Wraith

09:43.341 --> 09:45.104
at one point or another, haven't we?

09:45.209 --> 09:49.407
It's just... The important thing is that
you were rescued. Safe and sound.

09:49.514 --> 09:52.881
Safe, yes.
The sound part, I'm not so sure of.

09:54.585 --> 09:56.450
Yeah, well, it's...

09:59.857 --> 10:00.881
Well...

10:02.660 --> 10:07.460
- I guess I'd better be going.
- Right. You got it.

10:08.466 --> 10:09.660
<i>MICHAEL: See you.</i>

10:19.777 --> 10:23.076
Defend. Defend. Parry. Strike.

10:23.848 --> 10:25.543
(GRUNTING)

10:29.687 --> 10:30.984
(GROANS)

10:31.422 --> 10:34.653
It is all about
catching your opponent off balance.

10:35.159 --> 10:36.626
You succeeded.

10:38.796 --> 10:40.229
Now you try.

10:41.065 --> 10:42.828
I can't do that move.

10:43.368 --> 10:44.960
Oh, yes, you can.

10:46.037 --> 10:49.006
- You keep saying I'm a good fighter.
- You are.

10:49.407 --> 10:50.704
Very good.

10:51.976 --> 10:53.273
All right.

10:53.611 --> 10:55.078
(EXHALES)

10:59.250 --> 11:00.877
(GRUNTING)

11:14.799 --> 11:17.825
Wow, you were right.
I can't believe I just...

11:19.237 --> 11:21.000
Keep your hands off her!

11:21.105 --> 11:25.235
Ronon, we were sparring
as part of his physical therapy. Let him go!

11:27.111 --> 11:28.135
Now!

11:30.948 --> 11:32.347
I'm sorry.

11:33.718 --> 11:35.652
Ronon is fairly new here in Atlantis.

11:35.753 --> 11:38.654
He's still making the adjustment
to our way of doing things.

11:38.756 --> 11:40.796
He's clashed a few times
with some of the personnel,

11:40.825 --> 11:43.293
including yourself
and even Colonel Sheppard.

11:43.394 --> 11:45.419
I'll just have to stay clear of him.

11:45.530 --> 11:46.997
Whatever I did to make him angry,

11:47.098 --> 11:50.556
he doesn't look like the kind of person
you want to have as an enemy.

11:50.668 --> 11:52.135
Give him time.

11:52.703 --> 11:56.434
I'm sure you'll work out your differences,
put the past behind you.

11:56.541 --> 11:57.769
The past?

11:58.643 --> 12:00.235
Whatever that is.

12:03.281 --> 12:05.249
It's just so frustrating.

12:06.684 --> 12:09.118
I didn't even remember
the faces of my own parents.

12:09.220 --> 12:11.620
They've been informed
of your condition.

12:11.722 --> 12:14.816
In time, we'll send you home
to be reunited with them,

12:14.926 --> 12:17.952
but for now,
I think it's best if we hold off.

12:18.996 --> 12:21.487
So, what do you think?
Will my memory ever return?

12:21.599 --> 12:23.191
We can't be sure,

12:23.534 --> 12:27.561
but we'll continue with these sessions,
perhaps even try hypnosis.

12:28.739 --> 12:31.139
I just want to get back to normal.

12:32.677 --> 12:34.542
Be like everybody else.

12:40.952 --> 12:42.112
(GASPS)

12:42.220 --> 12:43.482
(PANTING)

13:19.490 --> 13:20.957
(PANTING)

13:33.838 --> 13:36.671
<i>MICHAEL: It was so real.
I know it was a dream,</i>

13:38.576 --> 13:41.443
but when I saw that face
staring back at me...

13:43.981 --> 13:46.575
They did something to me,
didn't they?

13:47.351 --> 13:49.546
The Wraith, during my capture.

13:50.555 --> 13:53.217
They did something to my mind.

13:54.191 --> 13:57.092
Maybe they implanted something
into my brain.

13:59.363 --> 14:00.955
What did they do?

14:02.967 --> 14:04.161
Tell me.

14:05.836 --> 14:07.326
We do not know.

14:11.175 --> 14:14.736
Listen, many people here
have had such dreams.

14:15.279 --> 14:17.110
You are not the only one.

14:17.214 --> 14:18.374
Really?

14:19.317 --> 14:22.946
The constant fear of the Wraith attacking,
the way they feed on us?

14:23.054 --> 14:24.885
It creates a tremendous amount of stress.

14:24.989 --> 14:27.753
- You've had the dream, too?
- Yes.

14:29.427 --> 14:32.555
Many times,
and I know how frightening it can be.

14:35.433 --> 14:37.833
- He's only had the one dream?
<i>- TEYLA: Yes.</i>

14:38.369 --> 14:41.770
He believes the Wraith did something
to him during his capture.

14:41.872 --> 14:43.965
Can you do something to help him?

14:44.075 --> 14:47.476
Perhaps I could give him a sedative
to help him sleep.

14:47.712 --> 14:49.236
Or I could increase his dosage.

14:49.347 --> 14:51.315
Although I'd caution against it
at this time.

14:51.415 --> 14:53.849
Why? If it's helping,
what's wrong with giving him more?

14:53.951 --> 14:56.476
Because, Rodney,
I specifically calibrated his regimen

14:56.587 --> 14:59.055
according to
his current physical condition.

14:59.156 --> 15:01.818
Any alteration could adversely affect
his recovery.

15:01.926 --> 15:03.791
I say we remain patient,

15:04.261 --> 15:06.627
wait to see if he has any more dreams.

15:06.731 --> 15:08.426
If it's merely psychological,

15:08.532 --> 15:11.000
then Dr. Heightmeyer
should be able to help him through it.

15:11.102 --> 15:13.696
Why do we not just tell him the truth?

15:14.672 --> 15:17.300
I'm finding it difficult
keeping it from him.

15:17.408 --> 15:22.107
And I'm beginning to question whether
our course of action is the correct one.

15:30.588 --> 15:31.919
(EXHALES)

15:36.293 --> 15:39.091
The dreams are most likely
due to post-traumatic stress,

15:39.196 --> 15:42.097
not at all uncommon
in situations like yours.

15:42.333 --> 15:43.766
You could see
Dr. Beckett after you leave,

15:43.868 --> 15:46.336
- have him prescribe something for sleep.
- I just...

15:46.437 --> 15:48.735
I can't help thinking there's more to it.

15:48.839 --> 15:50.898
Something's not right with me.

15:51.008 --> 15:52.839
- Do you feel sick?
- No.

15:54.045 --> 15:55.774
I mean, I feel like...

15:56.447 --> 15:59.348
I don't know what it is,
but it's not right.

16:00.184 --> 16:01.412
It's not.

16:01.886 --> 16:04.252
Everyone around here,
I get the feeling like they know something,

16:04.355 --> 16:06.721
something they're not telling me.

16:08.793 --> 16:12.320
See? That. Your expression.
I see that a lot around here.

16:12.663 --> 16:14.756
People being careful with me,

16:14.999 --> 16:18.162
like they're trying to figure out
what to say next.

16:18.269 --> 16:21.363
And you think this means
that they're keeping secrets from you?

16:21.472 --> 16:23.269
Maybe not deliberately, but, yes.

16:23.374 --> 16:27.037
I get the feeling they know something
about me but aren't telling me,

16:27.144 --> 16:28.907
and it's frustrating.

16:29.380 --> 16:33.146
Because if the Wraith did something
to me, I'd really like to know what it is.

16:37.855 --> 16:39.618
<i>- SHEPPARD: Lieutenant.</i>
- Colonel.

16:40.157 --> 16:42.148
- Where you off to?
- My quarters.

16:42.259 --> 16:45.592
Dr. Beckett gave me some pills
to help me get some sleep.

16:45.696 --> 16:49.564
- I thought I'd give them a try.
- No alcohol or heavy machinery.

16:50.101 --> 16:51.398
Excuse me?

16:52.169 --> 16:53.898
Nothing. Sleep well.

16:54.338 --> 16:58.104
Hey, Ronon, I don't know
what happened between us in the past,

16:58.943 --> 17:02.811
but if I ever did anything to hurt
or upset you, I just wanted to say

17:04.281 --> 17:05.646
that I'm sorry.

17:08.319 --> 17:10.412
Ronon, shake the man's hand.

17:10.521 --> 17:12.113
I don't think so.

17:14.391 --> 17:17.656
He's trying to bury the hatchet.
It's not a bad idea, don't you think?

17:17.762 --> 17:20.492
- I gotta go.
- Look, I just wanna know...

17:23.032 --> 17:25.092
Knock it off! Knock it off.

17:41.051 --> 17:42.575
(EXHALING)

17:49.860 --> 17:52.328
Lieutenant Kenmore,
what are you doing up so late?

17:52.429 --> 17:54.226
The pills Dr. Beckett gave me
aren't working.

17:54.331 --> 17:56.526
I'm gonna go to the infirmary.

17:56.767 --> 17:58.064
After you.

18:02.673 --> 18:03.662
Hi.

18:07.311 --> 18:08.676
Dr. Beckett.

20:08.098 --> 20:10.692
<i>BECKETT: Delta wave frequencies
are up 2.9 hertz.</i>

20:11.235 --> 20:14.295
<i>- WEIR: Which means?</i>
- He may regain consciousness.

20:24.214 --> 20:25.442
<i>(MICHAEL SCREAMING)</i>

20:29.119 --> 20:31.053
<i>Quick, five milligrams!</i>

20:38.362 --> 20:39.727
<i>Release me!</i>

20:42.232 --> 20:43.927
<i>(MICHAEL GROANING)</i>

20:52.142 --> 20:53.234
<i>(WRAITH GROWLING)</i>

20:53.344 --> 20:55.175
<i>WRAITH: You will die for this!</i>

20:56.280 --> 20:58.271
<i>Others will come for me!
They will destroy you.</i>

20:58.382 --> 21:01.374
<i>SHEPPARD: Blah, blah, blah.
RONON: They gotta find us first.</i>

21:02.519 --> 21:05.818
<i>You're gonna need a name.
How does Mike sound?</i>

21:05.923 --> 21:07.117
<i>(SCREAMING)</i>

21:18.936 --> 21:20.301
(PANTING)

21:23.941 --> 21:25.431
You lied to me!

21:26.777 --> 21:28.210
I'm a Wraith!

21:29.513 --> 21:31.845
You were a Wraith, yes.

21:33.984 --> 21:36.452
- Michael, please.
- Don't call me that. That's not my name!

21:36.553 --> 21:38.487
All right. Take it easy.

21:39.089 --> 21:41.182
If you would let us explain.

21:42.359 --> 21:44.350
Go ahead, explain.

21:45.129 --> 21:46.721
But no more lies!

21:47.865 --> 21:50.834
All right.
This is what we know of the Wraith.

21:51.168 --> 21:54.695
They evolved from a creature
that we call the iratus bug.

21:55.105 --> 21:59.041
That bug began taking on characteristics
of the humans it was feeding on,

21:59.410 --> 22:02.573
and over time
became the Wraith that we know now.

22:03.047 --> 22:05.447
So, Dr. Beckett has developed a drug.

22:05.549 --> 22:07.073
It's a retrovirus

22:07.184 --> 22:09.209
designed to suppress
the iratus bug elements

22:09.319 --> 22:11.310
of the Wraith genetic code,

22:11.455 --> 22:14.015
leaving only the human aspects behind.

22:14.858 --> 22:16.951
It took some time to perfect,

22:17.061 --> 22:19.621
but we finally achieved a viable drug,

22:20.597 --> 22:22.792
which we then decided to test.

22:24.168 --> 22:25.658
The injections?

22:26.937 --> 22:28.928
- The insulin?
- Not insulin.

22:29.373 --> 22:30.670
I'm sorry.

22:31.141 --> 22:33.041
You see,
once the retrovirus was administered

22:33.143 --> 22:34.940
and the transformation began,

22:35.045 --> 22:38.742
another drug was needed to prevent
the Wraith element from returning.

22:38.849 --> 22:40.544
It's actually a combination of drugs,

22:40.651 --> 22:43.381
which, unfortunately,
require a daily injection.

22:43.720 --> 22:45.517
So, what are you saying?

22:46.190 --> 22:48.556
That being a Wraith
is some kind of disease?

22:48.659 --> 22:50.650
Something you think you can cure?

22:53.931 --> 22:56.491
What gives you the right to do this to me?

22:56.600 --> 22:58.033
We're at war.

22:59.002 --> 23:02.494
The Wraith will stop at nothing
to kill every one of us.

23:03.407 --> 23:07.070
And we'll stop at nothing
to make sure that doesn't happen.

23:07.177 --> 23:09.509
You made up everything.

23:11.315 --> 23:12.509
My name,

23:13.884 --> 23:16.045
the photograph of my parents.

23:18.789 --> 23:21.087
It was my decision
to keep the truth from you.

23:21.191 --> 23:22.249
Why?

23:22.459 --> 23:24.484
For one, we were concerned
that if you were told,

23:24.595 --> 23:26.563
you may react the way you are now.

23:26.663 --> 23:30.326
The whole point was to erase
any trace of Wraith inside you,

23:30.434 --> 23:32.732
not to keep reminding you of it.

23:33.170 --> 23:37.573
And trust me, you're a hell of a lot
better off now than you were before.

23:38.675 --> 23:40.870
Since we're telling the truth.

23:43.680 --> 23:46.808
- This whole thing was a bad idea.
- No, it wasn't.

23:47.251 --> 23:50.379
The retrovirus works, that much is clear.
Just look at the guy.

23:50.487 --> 23:53.149
If we can figure out how to deploy
this as a biological weapon,

23:53.257 --> 23:55.919
it's possible
that we can hit entire hive ships

23:56.026 --> 23:57.459
and turn them into humans.

23:57.961 --> 23:59.588
That's still a ways off.

23:59.696 --> 24:01.755
And I've yet to develop
an effective long-term dose

24:01.865 --> 24:04.299
to keep the Wraith elements suppressed
for a lifetime.

24:04.401 --> 24:06.528
But the point is, we are getting closer.

24:06.637 --> 24:09.538
You know, you may be able
to make them look like a human,

24:09.640 --> 24:11.232
talk like a human,

24:11.508 --> 24:13.703
but they'll still be a Wraith.

24:15.712 --> 24:18.272
Nothing you do will ever change that.

24:27.524 --> 24:28.718
Michael?

24:31.762 --> 24:33.252
I know you are angry.

24:33.363 --> 24:36.332
I am sorry
for what you have been put through.

24:38.235 --> 24:41.102
But in time,
I think you may come to see this as...

24:41.205 --> 24:44.003
Were you part of the team
that captured me?

24:52.883 --> 24:54.748
You told me before

24:55.652 --> 24:59.520
that you and your team rescued me
when I was captured by the Wraith.

25:01.592 --> 25:05.358
But now I'm starting to realize
who did the actual capturing.

25:09.166 --> 25:12.260
And you have the nerve to tell me
you're my friend.

25:12.369 --> 25:14.633
I would like to be your friend.

25:15.606 --> 25:18.302
- I would.
- You expect me to believe that?

25:18.775 --> 25:22.108
You may not understand this now,
but making you human,

25:22.312 --> 25:25.110
- I believe this could make your life better.
- Really?

25:25.215 --> 25:27.274
Because from what I was told,

25:27.384 --> 25:31.445
you made me human
in order to make your lives better.

25:36.260 --> 25:37.818
So tell me, then,

25:40.831 --> 25:44.267
what makes being human
better than being a Wraith?

25:44.868 --> 25:46.335
They are evil.

25:47.271 --> 25:48.636
They kill us,

25:49.339 --> 25:52.740
feed on us, show no mercy,
know nothing of compassion.

25:52.843 --> 25:54.470
- Humans are different?
- Yes.

25:54.578 --> 25:56.409
So, what you did to me...

26:00.250 --> 26:02.548
That was done out of compassion?

26:05.255 --> 26:08.156
Your feelings of betrayal
are understandable,

26:09.393 --> 26:12.055
but it's important you talk about them,

26:12.529 --> 26:14.793
hopefully come to resolve them.

26:15.032 --> 26:16.260
With you?

26:17.200 --> 26:19.600
Yes, of course.

26:20.370 --> 26:23.771
I already tried that once.
It didn't work out so well.

26:27.244 --> 26:30.111
But something
was cleared up for me, though.

26:31.782 --> 26:35.548
Now I know what that strange feeling
was, the one that's been

26:36.553 --> 26:38.180
gnawing inside me.

26:40.190 --> 26:43.318
Seems I can't shake
those basic Wraith instincts.

26:44.328 --> 26:45.625
Hunger,

26:45.962 --> 26:47.327
aggression.

26:47.864 --> 26:50.025
And now that I know the truth,

26:51.768 --> 26:54.259
I feel them even more.

27:02.080 --> 27:03.395
<i>WEIR: Dr. Heightmeyer confirmed</i>

27:03.400 --> 27:05.868
he believes he's still experiencing
Wraith compulsions.

27:05.980 --> 27:08.644
Is there anything more you can do
to help suppress them?

27:08.785 --> 27:12.653
I don't know. It could merely be
a psychological manifestation.

27:13.223 --> 27:15.316
Maybe we should up his dose.

27:16.193 --> 27:19.458
Yeah, I know. You said give it more time,
but now that he knows what's going on,

27:19.563 --> 27:21.861
things might start going
from bad to worse.

27:21.965 --> 27:24.991
- I agree.
- He's due for his next injection now.

27:25.802 --> 27:29.238
I could go ahead, increase the dosage
and monitor him closely.

27:29.339 --> 27:31.068
Let's just hope he agrees to take it.

27:31.174 --> 27:33.938
Well, if he doesn't, we'll have to insist.

27:34.177 --> 27:38.307
Who knows, maybe another big dose
might wipe his memory clean again.

27:39.483 --> 27:40.950
And then what?

27:41.084 --> 27:43.450
We start the lies all over again?

27:47.724 --> 27:49.988
They want you in the infirmary.

27:52.462 --> 27:54.430
Time for your injection.

28:22.526 --> 28:24.221
What are you doing?

28:26.763 --> 28:28.731
What do you want from me?

28:29.599 --> 28:32.932
Just waiting for you
to give me a reason to kill you.

28:36.807 --> 28:39.173
Well, I guess I should thank you.

28:39.643 --> 28:43.044
You're the only one around here
who's been honest with me from the start.

28:43.146 --> 28:45.546
Lieutenant Kenmore, the infirmary?

28:47.117 --> 28:48.584
You heard him.

28:49.719 --> 28:51.311
Better get moving,

28:52.222 --> 28:53.553
Lieutenant.

29:06.169 --> 29:09.705
This is Sergeant Cole. Kenmore's escaped.
Level five, East Tower.

29:09.806 --> 29:11.305
Ronon's also in pursuit.

29:33.697 --> 29:35.589
<i>MICHAEL: Drop your weapon.</i>

29:36.566 --> 29:39.967
- Just take it easy, Lieutenant.
- Stop calling me that.

29:40.237 --> 29:41.829
Drop your weapon.

30:17.107 --> 30:19.871
I figured you'd forget to set it to stun.

30:21.344 --> 30:23.005
Sergeant Cole.

30:24.447 --> 30:25.846
He's dead.

30:35.559 --> 30:38.494
<i>WEIR: We can't keep him here.
Even locked up, he's too dangerous.</i>

30:38.595 --> 30:40.062
We can take him to the Alpha site.

30:40.163 --> 30:42.825
We'll sedate first
so he won't know where it is.

30:43.900 --> 30:45.367
And then what?

30:46.636 --> 30:49.605
- Continue with the drug treatments.
- Continue?

30:49.940 --> 30:52.272
Dr. Beckett was about
to start increasing the dosage.

30:52.375 --> 30:53.569
Hopefully, that will be effective

30:53.677 --> 30:55.975
in eliminating
any remaining Wraith impulses.

30:56.079 --> 30:58.547
Why are we even talking about this?

30:58.715 --> 31:00.876
He killed one of your people.

31:01.251 --> 31:03.344
Your experiment didn't work.

31:03.820 --> 31:06.345
- We should kill him right now.
- We can't kill him, Ronon.

31:06.456 --> 31:08.083
We're the ones who put him
in this position...

31:08.191 --> 31:09.783
Now, hold on a minute, Doc.

31:09.893 --> 31:12.225
If we hadn't given him the retrovirus,
he'd still be a Wraith.

31:12.329 --> 31:16.026
- Wouldn't think twice about killing him.
- But we did give him the retrovirus.

31:16.132 --> 31:17.429
We made him human.

31:17.534 --> 31:19.900
Now we have the responsibility
to treat him as we would any other...

31:20.003 --> 31:22.028
He's not human!

31:22.906 --> 31:24.373
He's a Wraith.

31:31.781 --> 31:33.772
Carson, what do you think?

31:33.984 --> 31:36.885
Is it worth continuing
with these treatments?

31:38.421 --> 31:39.388
I...

31:40.957 --> 31:42.424
I don't know.

31:43.093 --> 31:46.722
I suppose it's worth seeing
how he fares with the increased dosage.

31:46.830 --> 31:48.024
I agree.

31:48.765 --> 31:52.030
We've come too far with this
just to abandon it now.

31:57.173 --> 31:58.538
(DOOR OPENING)

32:00.243 --> 32:02.438
Would you please step outside?

32:06.449 --> 32:08.246
What's going to happen to me?

32:08.351 --> 32:10.182
You will be transported to another planet

32:10.286 --> 32:13.084
where we are establishing
an off-world base.

32:13.957 --> 32:17.358
You want to keep me
from learning more about Atlantis.

32:18.762 --> 32:20.957
You're afraid that
if a Wraith ship comes close enough,

32:21.064 --> 32:22.827
I'll communicate with them,

32:23.233 --> 32:25.064
tell them you're here.

32:28.097 --> 32:30.088
I didn't want to kill him.

32:32.068 --> 32:33.933
I just wanted to escape.

32:35.237 --> 32:37.205
To get out of this place.

32:37.974 --> 32:40.943
We would like to continue
the drug treatments.

32:42.011 --> 32:43.842
Dr. Beckett believes
that an increased dose

32:43.946 --> 32:47.347
would fully suppress any Wraith urges
you may still be experiencing.

32:52.254 --> 32:54.222
The alternative is death.

32:57.193 --> 33:00.458
<i>BECKETT: All of this up to the Jumper bay:
EEG, defib, cardiograph.</i>

33:00.563 --> 33:02.531
Oh, and cross-check the medications
on the list I gave you.

33:02.631 --> 33:04.724
Make certain
we're good for at least a week.

33:04.834 --> 33:06.199
Got a lot of equipment to take with us.

33:06.302 --> 33:07.831
From what I understand,
the Alpha site

33:07.832 --> 33:09.437
is not exactly set up for
this kind of work.

33:09.438 --> 33:12.236
It's not set up for much of anything yet,
I'm afraid.

33:12.341 --> 33:13.603
Hey, how are you holding up?

33:13.709 --> 33:16.507
Oh, I don't know.
Because of me, a man is dead.

33:16.612 --> 33:18.045
You can't blame yourself for that.

33:18.147 --> 33:20.377
Elizabeth, I'm the one
who developed the retrovirus.

33:20.483 --> 33:22.178
I'm the one who pushed
for this experiment.

33:22.284 --> 33:23.273
Of course I'm to blame!

33:23.386 --> 33:26.981
And I'm the one who approved it.
This was my call, Carson,

33:27.123 --> 33:31.583
so if there's any blame to be laid,
it starts and ends with me, all right?

33:34.864 --> 33:36.058
Colonel.

33:37.900 --> 33:39.231
Time to go.

33:45.574 --> 33:46.768
<i>MAN: Clear.</i>

34:03.092 --> 34:04.354

34:05.194 --> 34:07.389
It is all right. You are safe.

34:09.998 --> 34:11.466
What happened?

34:11.634 --> 34:14.762
You were sedated
for transport to the Alpha site.

34:17.907 --> 34:19.534
Just a precaution.

34:23.079 --> 34:24.808
How are you feeling?

34:26.748 --> 34:27.909
Hungry.

34:30.085 --> 34:32.748
I will see about getting you some food.

35:02.985 --> 35:05.283
They call them "meals ready to eat."

35:05.387 --> 35:08.185
It was all I could gather on short notice.

35:08.557 --> 35:11.117
Dr. McKay quite likes them, actually.

35:17.366 --> 35:18.924
Let me help you.

35:28.210 --> 35:29.575
That's okay.

35:34.383 --> 35:36.749
You're different from the others.

35:38.087 --> 35:40.681
I noticed it the first time I saw you.

35:41.957 --> 35:44.858
You're the only person
willing to understand.

35:47.062 --> 35:49.553
The only one with a truly open mind.

35:49.665 --> 35:50.927
(ECHOING)

36:06.515 --> 36:09.109
The only one willing to show compassion.

36:09.218 --> 36:10.651
(ECHOING)

36:19.428 --> 36:21.020
Thank you, Teyla.

36:22.231 --> 36:23.323
(GASPS)

36:24.767 --> 36:26.928
I knew I could count on you.

36:31.840 --> 36:33.137
- Colonel.
- What happened?

36:33.242 --> 36:34.231
I don't quite know.

36:34.343 --> 36:36.777
He somehow managed to get free
of his restraints and take Teyla hostage.

36:36.879 --> 36:38.744
He forced the security detail
outside the infirmary

36:38.847 --> 36:40.075
to drop their weapons or he'd kill her.

36:40.182 --> 36:41.274
- Where'd they go?
- Up the ridge.

36:41.383 --> 36:43.317
Bravo team's on the way.

36:53.929 --> 36:55.556
Just a precaution.

36:57.299 --> 36:58.459
I know.

36:58.767 --> 37:00.860
You're angry. I lied to you,

37:01.337 --> 37:03.828
but you had no right to do this to me!

37:03.939 --> 37:06.635
I won't let you
experiment on me anymore.

37:08.310 --> 37:09.538
Let's go.

37:18.320 --> 37:20.049
He's changing directions.

37:20.155 --> 37:22.623
The tracks are difficult to follow.

37:23.792 --> 37:25.054
He's good.

37:25.160 --> 37:28.755
But you can follow them, right?
I mean, that's your thing.

37:29.198 --> 37:31.132
Among many other things.

37:32.334 --> 37:33.733
This way.

37:36.839 --> 37:38.534
<i>TEYLA: What are you doing?</i>

37:38.741 --> 37:40.538
I need to leave this planet.

37:42.111 --> 37:43.601
And go where?

37:47.149 --> 37:48.673
I don't know.

38:12.541 --> 38:15.203
These are the SOs guarding the gate.

38:31.860 --> 38:33.088
(GROANS)

38:33.696 --> 38:34.890
Damn it!

38:39.368 --> 38:41.063
What is this place?

38:44.306 --> 38:45.534
That way.

38:52.748 --> 38:54.549
We need to figure out
the last address dialed,

38:54.550 --> 38:56.484
if that's even possible.

38:56.819 --> 38:59.652
- We need to get McKay out here.
- No, we don't.

38:59.755 --> 39:02.952
Trust me, he's the only one
who can figure this stuff out.

39:03.058 --> 39:04.116
Look.

39:13.569 --> 39:15.764
How much further must we walk?

39:16.872 --> 39:18.601
We'll rest up ahead.

39:22.878 --> 39:24.743
I am sensing something.

39:26.148 --> 39:28.082
There are Wraith nearby.

39:29.651 --> 39:31.243
Yes, there are.

39:35.023 --> 39:37.617
It is not too late. We can still go back.

39:37.726 --> 39:40.126
Dr. Beckett can give you an injection
and take away the pain.

39:40.162 --> 39:41.151
No!

39:43.999 --> 39:46.297
This is how it's supposed to be.

39:46.502 --> 39:48.732
I'm returning to what I was.

39:51.473 --> 39:54.033
What I am.

40:26.241 --> 40:29.404
This is what I was drawn to.

40:30.779 --> 40:32.542
They are aware of us.

40:36.118 --> 40:37.676
They are coming.

40:38.187 --> 40:39.313
I know,

40:40.756 --> 40:42.747
and I will return to them.

40:45.294 --> 40:47.558
Then we shall be enemies again.

40:50.032 --> 40:52.296
We never stopped being enemies.

40:54.837 --> 40:57.397
What will you do with me, feed on me?

40:57.539 --> 41:00.133
Is that why you brought me all this way?

41:00.242 --> 41:03.268
I'd be lying if I said
I didn't feel the urge.

41:07.449 --> 41:10.213
And now that I'm truly able to feed again,

41:14.223 --> 41:15.952
I feel it even more.

41:18.827 --> 41:20.294
Then go ahead.

41:25.133 --> 41:26.464
(MOANING)

41:41.183 --> 41:42.480
(GUN FIRING)

41:47.122 --> 41:48.646
Fall back!

42:04.740 --> 42:06.173
He's alive.

42:14.383 --> 42:16.703
<i>WEIR: He completely transformed
back into a Wraith?</i>

42:16.818 --> 42:18.911
Not completely, but well on his way.

42:19.021 --> 42:22.218
His reversion occurred at a much
more accelerated rate than we anticipated.

42:22.324 --> 42:25.452
Unfortunately, his memory
of what we did to him remained intact.

42:25.561 --> 42:27.461
I should've killed him
when I had the chance.

42:27.563 --> 42:29.292
He's right. We are totally screwed!

42:29.398 --> 42:31.161
Not only has our dear lieutenant
rejoined the Wraith,

42:31.266 --> 42:33.427
but he has taken with him the knowledge
that Atlantis still exists.

42:33.535 --> 42:36.561
God knows what type of intel
he was able to pick up during his stay.

42:36.672 --> 42:38.970
They will send another wave of hive ships.

42:39.074 --> 42:40.598
Probably already on their way.

42:40.609 --> 42:41.994
And this time, I'm guessing
they're not gonna

42:41.997 --> 42:44.897
fall for the whole
invisibility trick.

42:47.015 --> 42:49.813
We need to come up
with a new defense plan.

42:51.019 --> 42:53.579
We're gonna need more firepower.
