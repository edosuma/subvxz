<i>Previously on "Stitchers"...</i>

00:01.554 --> 00:03.843
The more physically intimate
you guys are,

00:03.882 --> 00:06.679
the more it's gonna mess
with your ability to stitch.

00:08.358 --> 00:09.764
Linus: <i>How long are you
gonna keep this up for?</i>

00:09.820 --> 00:12.188
As long as it takes for you to
work up a damn oxytocin filter.

00:12.222 --> 00:14.499
We have to do this if we're
gonna save my mother.

00:14.523 --> 00:15.436
Oh, I know.

00:15.468 --> 00:16.874
Kirsten: Her chamber!
The computers, the monitors.

00:16.899 --> 00:18.796
Everything is just gone!
Where's my mother?

00:18.835 --> 00:20.129
The less you know, the better.

00:20.164 --> 00:23.733
Is this, um, too soon? Us doing
the whole sister routine?

00:23.767 --> 00:25.635
Maybe, but... I like it.

00:25.669 --> 00:28.371
We know as well as you do
that you've been seeing Daniel Stinger.

00:29.373 --> 00:30.640
What is gonna happen to me?

00:30.674 --> 00:32.208
Well, that all depends on you.

00:34.044 --> 00:36.073
I need a friend.

00:36.324 --> 00:38.192
Stinger: <i>How do you think
your new friends would feel</i>

00:38.226 --> 00:41.195
if they found out who was really
behind the young Cameron anomaly?

00:41.229 --> 00:43.030
Why would I ever leave this memory?

00:43.064 --> 00:44.632
You never have to.

00:44.666 --> 00:46.400
- Come here! Look at this.
- (beeping)

00:46.434 --> 00:48.802
Kirsten: Ivy ran the anomaly on us.

00:48.837 --> 00:50.771
She's the one who almost killed me.

01:03.685 --> 01:05.185
I'm really glad you called.

01:05.220 --> 01:06.920
- I could really use some sister time.
- Come in.

01:09.791 --> 01:11.225
Linus! What are you doing...

01:11.259 --> 01:12.726
I didn't expect to see you here.

01:12.761 --> 01:14.295
Yeah. That's the whole point.

01:14.329 --> 01:16.964
Okay. What's going on?

01:16.998 --> 01:18.899
That's what we want to know.

01:18.933 --> 01:20.532
What are you talking about?

01:20.556 --> 01:22.201
We're talking about what
we found on your computer.

01:22.203 --> 01:23.837
When were you on my laptop?

01:23.872 --> 01:25.739
While you were out. Yoga.

01:25.774 --> 01:26.940
Wait. You broke into my place?

01:26.975 --> 01:29.543
Well, you broke
into Kirsten's mind, so...

01:29.577 --> 01:32.146
- Kirsten?
- We know you're the anomaly, Ivy.

01:32.180 --> 01:34.448
We found your 3D model of Cameron.

01:34.482 --> 01:36.717
You trapped me in that
memory, not Stinger.

01:38.620 --> 01:40.321
- Let me explain.
- Cameron: Explain what?

01:40.355 --> 01:42.056
How you locked your sister
in a coma for three days?

01:42.090 --> 01:44.291
- How you almost killed her?
- I helped wake you up!

01:44.326 --> 01:45.793
That was only after we called you.

01:45.827 --> 01:47.261
What if we hadn't brought you in?

01:47.295 --> 01:48.529
Why did you do it?

01:53.868 --> 01:55.202
Because...

01:56.338 --> 01:58.806
you made our father leave me...

01:58.840 --> 02:00.040
again.

02:01.476 --> 02:05.145
He told me that we were
all going to be together.

02:05.180 --> 02:06.814
A family.

02:06.848 --> 02:08.115
So, I believed him.

02:08.149 --> 02:10.616
When you called
the NSA on him, and he left,

02:10.651 --> 02:11.852
and I was so upset,

02:11.886 --> 02:15.155
I took over the avatar of young
Cameron that he created.

02:15.190 --> 02:17.391
Wait. Hold on. You weren't
the anomaly the whole time?

02:17.425 --> 02:20.294
No. Only the time
that Kirsten was trapped.

02:20.328 --> 02:23.630
He was using that to make you trust him,

02:23.665 --> 02:24.965
to bring you back to us!

02:24.999 --> 02:26.467
We know you've been
in touch with Stinger.

02:26.501 --> 02:29.236
- Are you working for him?
- No.

02:29.270 --> 02:32.406
He showed up a few weeks ago,
and I kicked him out.

02:32.440 --> 02:35.909
Wow. You just can't stop lying.

02:35.944 --> 02:37.611
You really are your father's daughter.

02:37.645 --> 02:39.346
- Linus.
- No. I'm done.

02:39.381 --> 02:40.581
I'm out of here. No way.

02:43.184 --> 02:45.085
(door closes)

02:45.120 --> 02:47.821
You know all Linus ever did
was defend you, right?

02:47.856 --> 02:51.492
And the really sad thing is,
is that you are...

02:51.526 --> 02:53.193
totally incapable of knowing

02:53.228 --> 02:54.495
how much you just hurt my best friend.

02:54.529 --> 02:56.029
I do know.

02:57.399 --> 02:59.233
One day soon...

02:59.267 --> 03:01.201
this will all make sense.

03:01.236 --> 03:04.238
You literally messed with my head.

03:04.272 --> 03:07.741
I have spent every day since then

03:07.776 --> 03:10.244
trying to make it up to you.

03:10.278 --> 03:12.212
Doesn't that mean something?

03:12.247 --> 03:14.748
No! Not if we can't trust you.

03:14.783 --> 03:16.383
And we can't.

03:18.753 --> 03:21.155
You stabbed me in the back, Ivy.

03:21.189 --> 03:22.623
We're not friends.

03:22.657 --> 03:24.691
We're definitely not sisters.

03:24.726 --> 03:28.228
Just run on back to Stinger,
so we can be enemies.

03:28.263 --> 03:29.596
At least be honest about that.

03:29.631 --> 03:31.165
- Kirsten...
- No.

03:31.199 --> 03:32.466
Go.

03:33.601 --> 03:34.768
Go!

03:45.146 --> 03:46.447
(sighs)

03:51.019 --> 03:52.686

(door opens)

04:22.784 --> 04:24.551
Well, Cameron usually briefs me

04:24.586 --> 04:26.053
on what I've missed while I was gone.

04:26.087 --> 04:27.888
Do you have something to add, Kirsten?

04:27.922 --> 04:29.189
I could tell you something you missed,

04:29.224 --> 04:31.525
but I guess Fisher already told
you that we have that proof

04:31.559 --> 04:33.026
that Ivy's been in contact with Stinger.

04:33.061 --> 04:35.295
We're talking about
the surveillance photo.

04:35.330 --> 04:36.630
Were you gonna tell us about it?

04:36.664 --> 04:38.332
(sighs) Okay. Sit down, both of you.

04:44.706 --> 04:45.706
I didn't say anything

04:45.740 --> 04:47.207
because I didn't want you taking things

04:47.242 --> 04:48.408
into your own hands.

04:48.443 --> 04:49.743
But I suppose you already have.

04:49.777 --> 04:52.679
- We talked to Ivy.
- (sighs) And?

04:52.714 --> 04:53.847
We're not talking anymore.

04:53.882 --> 04:55.449
She claims that she's not
working with Stinger,

04:55.483 --> 04:57.451
- but we don't believe her.
- Did she say anything else?

04:57.485 --> 04:59.086
About Stinger? No.

04:59.120 --> 05:01.288
Then we will continue
to keep an eye on her.

05:01.322 --> 05:03.156
I just hope you haven't
scared Stinger away.

05:03.191 --> 05:05.759
You do remember that he is
the one that we are after?

05:07.762 --> 05:08.996
We also have proof that Ivy

05:09.030 --> 05:10.631
was the anomaly
that almost killed Kirsten.

05:10.665 --> 05:12.499
- Not Stinger.
- Ivy?

05:12.534 --> 05:13.534
We downloaded everything

05:13.568 --> 05:14.868
on her laptop. It's all there.

05:16.471 --> 05:18.238
I don't suppose you got a warrant

05:18.273 --> 05:19.840
to search her laptop?

05:20.842 --> 05:22.676
No?

05:22.710 --> 05:24.745
This is exactly why

05:24.779 --> 05:26.647
I didn't say anything about the picture.

05:26.681 --> 05:27.681
Kirsten: No, Maggie.

05:27.715 --> 05:30.117
This is exactly why you
need to talk to me more.

05:30.151 --> 05:32.686
Ivy, Stinger, my mother...
they're my family.

05:32.720 --> 05:34.388
They're not just NSA cases.

05:34.422 --> 05:36.156
Yes, they are NSA cases.

05:36.190 --> 05:37.858
But not only do you work for the NSA,

05:37.892 --> 05:39.026
you work for me.

05:39.060 --> 05:41.795
I tell you what you need
to know to do your job.

05:41.829 --> 05:43.597
Yes, Maggie. I do work for you.

05:44.699 --> 05:46.333
Cameron, Camille, Linus, and I,

05:46.367 --> 05:47.434
we put our lives on the line

05:47.468 --> 05:49.636
every single day.

05:49.671 --> 05:51.538
Now, I want something in return.

05:51.573 --> 05:53.874
<i>"Quid pro quo,</i> Clarice."

05:56.678 --> 05:57.978
It's from <i>Silence of the Lambs.</i>

05:59.881 --> 06:01.949
Okay, Kirsten. What do you want?

06:01.983 --> 06:03.750
Tell me where the NSA moved my mother.

06:03.785 --> 06:05.719
- I can't do that.
- If you can't tell me,

06:05.753 --> 06:07.154
I won't do another stitch.

06:07.188 --> 06:09.189
Kirsten, the only way
to save your mother

06:09.223 --> 06:10.490
is to keep mapping the brain.

06:10.525 --> 06:12.259
To do that, you have to keep stitching.

06:12.293 --> 06:14.361
I need to see for myself
that she's still alive.

06:14.395 --> 06:15.796
- Kirsten...
- Otherwise, there's no point.

06:15.830 --> 06:17.164
- Kirsten, I...
- No.

06:17.198 --> 06:19.733
No mom, no stitch.

06:22.570 --> 06:25.372
Cameron, will you please
talk some sense into her?

06:25.406 --> 06:27.441
I'm sorry, Maggie. I can't do that.

06:27.475 --> 06:29.076
Kirsten's my priority, not you.

06:29.110 --> 06:30.510
Not the NSA.

06:30.545 --> 06:32.312
If you know where Jacqueline
is, you gotta tell her.

06:41.956 --> 06:43.991
- Kirsten, hey.
- No! I have had it with this place.

06:44.025 --> 06:45.692
- I know.
- I am so angry.

06:45.727 --> 06:47.327
- I can see that.
- Maggie won't talk to me.

06:47.362 --> 06:49.630
My sister betrayed me, and... and you...

06:49.664 --> 06:52.299
- Whoa, whoa. Me what?
- I'm so pissed off!

06:53.434 --> 06:54.668
God, we can't be together.

06:54.702 --> 06:56.470
Cameron, this... this isn't a life.

06:56.504 --> 06:57.704
What kinda life is this?

06:57.739 --> 06:59.973
Hey, hey, look, Kirsten. Look at me.

07:00.008 --> 07:01.842
As long as we're together,
you are my life.

07:01.876 --> 07:04.444
If you don't want to stitch,
then I don't want you stitching.

07:04.479 --> 07:06.413
If you want to leave, then
I'm leaving with you, okay?

07:08.650 --> 07:10.417
Okay. Thank you.

07:10.451 --> 07:12.452
Yes. Come here.

07:12.487 --> 07:14.087
Guys, a case just came in.

07:14.122 --> 07:16.289
Maggie, I just told you...

07:16.324 --> 07:17.891
And I heard you.

07:17.925 --> 07:20.260
Help me solve this case,
and when we're done...

07:20.294 --> 07:21.695
I'll tell you what you want to know.

07:26.100 --> 07:27.567
Victim is Leslie Addams.

07:27.602 --> 07:30.137
20s, highly competitive
pro-volleyball player.

07:30.171 --> 07:32.339
Leslie died last night
of a stab wound to the back.

07:32.373 --> 07:33.840
Her body was found
this morning on the beach

07:33.875 --> 07:36.343
where she was supposed
to play a $75,000 tournament.

07:36.377 --> 07:38.745
Oh, I guess someone did not want
her taking that money home.

07:38.780 --> 07:42.115
- How many teams compete?
- 32 two-person teams.

07:42.150 --> 07:44.651
Leslie's teammate, Monica Chamberlain.

07:44.686 --> 07:46.453
Also 20s, also highly competitive.

07:46.487 --> 07:48.321
While they were a powerhouse
on the court,

07:48.356 --> 07:51.258
off court, Leslie and Monica had
some very public disagreements.

07:51.292 --> 07:53.226
They were even charged with
creating a public disturbance,

07:53.261 --> 07:55.095
landing them in court, which
they settled out of court.

07:55.129 --> 07:57.330
Maggie: The police have
cleared Monica as a suspect.

07:57.365 --> 07:59.933
Leslie's death disqualifies
her from competing,

07:59.967 --> 08:03.003
so besides clearly not
benefiting from Leslie's death,

08:03.037 --> 08:04.805
she also has a solid alibi.

08:04.839 --> 08:07.032
Monica was papped
at a pre-tournament party

08:07.079 --> 08:08.141
at the time of Leslie's death.

08:08.180 --> 08:10.210
- So, is there any other suspects?
- Not yet.

08:10.235 --> 08:11.945
But hopefully the stitch
will get us some answers.

08:11.979 --> 08:14.948
(equipment humming)

08:19.120 --> 08:21.388
(pop music playing)

08:26.360 --> 08:27.527
(crowd cheering)

08:27.562 --> 08:28.729
I'm at the tournament.

08:28.763 --> 08:31.298
Leslie and Monica
are playing another team.

08:31.332 --> 08:32.666
The crowd loves them.

08:32.700 --> 08:34.967
Does Leslie see anyone who
looks like they might hate her?

08:35.001 --> 08:36.203
Want to hurt her?

08:36.236 --> 08:39.139
Mm, nope. I'd say everyone's
totally Team Leslie here.

08:42.977 --> 08:44.711
- Okay, that was weird.
- What?

08:44.746 --> 08:46.346
I just got a flash of a woman

08:46.380 --> 08:48.415
in a changing area with a needle.

08:48.449 --> 08:50.550
I couldn't see her face, but she
was wearing the same uniform

08:50.585 --> 08:51.852
as Leslie and Monica.

08:51.886 --> 08:53.653
- Drugs?
- Steroids?

08:53.688 --> 08:55.655
I'll see if I can find that
memory, and we'll focus on it.

08:55.690 --> 08:58.258
Okay. I'm at a press event
for the tournament.

08:58.292 --> 08:59.526
Monica's giving an interview.

08:59.560 --> 09:01.361
Uh, both Leslie and I
have worked really hard

09:01.395 --> 09:02.963
to hone our own set of skills

09:02.997 --> 09:04.831
that really complement each other.

09:04.866 --> 09:07.501
Uh, but I think it really comes
down to teamwork and determination.

09:07.535 --> 09:10.070
That's just really the key for us.

09:10.104 --> 09:13.106
And having your teammate
carry you doesn't hurt either.

09:13.141 --> 09:14.741
Monica let a few slip by the baseline,

09:14.776 --> 09:16.076
but I feel like I brought my A-game.

09:16.110 --> 09:17.944
Leslie's kind of a bitch.

09:17.979 --> 09:19.513
She didn't just steal
Monica's thunder...

09:19.547 --> 09:21.448
she totally destroyed her.

09:21.482 --> 09:24.551
Textbook 'roid rage. $20 says
Leslie's the one shooting up.

09:24.585 --> 09:25.852
I'll take that bet.

09:25.887 --> 09:28.121
Okay, I am locked on
to the steroid memory.

09:28.156 --> 09:30.657
All right, moving you back
to the steroid memory, baller.

09:32.426 --> 09:34.327
- (seagulls cawing)
- Okay, I'm here.

09:34.362 --> 09:36.797
Monica. She's the one using.

09:36.831 --> 09:39.366
- That'll be $20.
- Put it on my tab.

09:39.400 --> 09:42.166
I know it's hard keeping up,
but steroids, Monica? Really?

09:42.191 --> 09:43.197
Just lay off.

09:43.221 --> 09:45.105
If you get caught juicing,
we'll both be disqualified.

09:45.106 --> 09:48.542
For once, Leslie,
keep your big mouth shut.

09:48.576 --> 09:50.076
- Or I...
- Or what?

09:50.111 --> 09:52.145
Kirsten: Pretty sure Monica
just threatened Leslie's life.

09:52.180 --> 09:54.514
Sounds like motive to me.
Okay, we're running out of time.

09:54.549 --> 09:55.882
Moving you to the death memory.

09:56.951 --> 09:58.985
Okay. Leslie's alone.

09:59.020 --> 10:01.087
She's on the beach.

10:01.122 --> 10:02.289
Wait. Someone's coming.

10:02.323 --> 10:03.790
It's a guy, 20s, beard.

10:03.825 --> 10:05.659
I haven't seen him
in any of her other memories.

10:05.693 --> 10:07.394
Oh, hey.

10:09.163 --> 10:10.964
He seems nervous, on edge.

10:10.998 --> 10:13.099
- Stalker.
- Crazed fan?

10:13.134 --> 10:15.702
- I don't think she knows him.
- Are you Leslie Addams?

10:15.736 --> 10:17.304
Kirsten: He wants a picture.

10:17.338 --> 10:19.573
I called it. That's a fan. I would know.

10:19.607 --> 10:22.375
Wait, not a picture.
He's recording video.

10:22.410 --> 10:24.177
The window's open
to a browser with a logo on it.

10:24.212 --> 10:25.712
It's a green pepper, I think.

10:25.746 --> 10:27.647
I'm kind of in the middle
of mentally preparing

10:27.682 --> 10:29.249
- for tomorrow's tournament, so...
- I'm sorry.

10:32.253 --> 10:33.553
Oh my God.

10:33.588 --> 10:34.788
Kirsten: He just pulled a knife.

10:34.822 --> 10:36.990
He's pointing the knife
and his phone at her.

10:38.793 --> 10:41.094
(Leslie panting)

10:41.128 --> 10:43.163
Okay, Kirsten, time to make the bounce.

10:44.699 --> 10:47.434
- (beeping rapidly)
- (knife thunks)

10:48.769 --> 10:50.303
(humming stops)

10:57.178 --> 11:00.080
Leslie ran, so I didn't see him
kill her, but I'm sure he did.

11:00.114 --> 11:01.882
So our suspect is a killer hipster

11:01.916 --> 11:03.984
who literally stabbed a
volleyball player in the back?

11:04.018 --> 11:05.719
Linus: He shot a video while he did it.

11:05.753 --> 11:08.154
That takes extreme sports
to a whole new extreme.

11:08.189 --> 11:10.056
Kirsten, is this the logo
you saw on his phone?

11:10.091 --> 11:11.625
Kirsten: Yeah, that's it.

11:11.659 --> 11:13.927
It signifies a browser
configured for TOR.

11:13.961 --> 11:17.230
- That's not good.
- The darknet is always bad news.

11:17.265 --> 11:21.434
It's a hub for any and every
illegal online activity.

11:21.469 --> 11:24.571
So he wasn't just saving a sick
and twisted video for himself...

11:24.605 --> 11:27.040
He used the darknet
to livestream her murder.

11:31.103 --> 11:33.031
So it isn't enough to just kill people?

11:33.056 --> 11:34.924
Now you got a live feed?

11:34.958 --> 11:36.826
You would if you had
a paying audience...

11:36.860 --> 11:38.661
or you wanted proof of purchase.

11:38.695 --> 11:40.329
Like some kinda thrill-kill club?

11:40.364 --> 11:42.431
"Kill" being the operative word.
It is the darknet.

11:42.466 --> 11:44.100
The Silk Road marketplace.

11:44.134 --> 11:46.002
Online flea market of sorts

11:46.036 --> 11:47.937
for drug dealers, dirtbags, you name it.

11:47.971 --> 11:50.172
But I thought they busted that
guy, shut the whole thing down.

11:50.207 --> 11:52.008
The Silk Road Marketplace was just one.

11:52.042 --> 11:53.576
There's thousands. It's the same idea,

11:53.610 --> 11:56.012
where everything and anything is sold.

11:56.046 --> 11:58.147
Drugs, people, killers for hire.

11:58.181 --> 11:59.915
Camille: It's Amazon for scumbags.

11:59.950 --> 12:01.317
And it's completely untraceable.

12:01.351 --> 12:03.052
I mean, that's the whole point
of the darknet.

12:03.086 --> 12:06.222
Payments are made in cryptocurrency...
bitcoins, altcoins...

12:06.256 --> 12:07.590
also untraceable.

12:07.624 --> 12:10.026
Okay, so let's say I want someone dead.

12:10.060 --> 12:13.029
On the darknet, killer and
contractor never have to meet?

12:13.063 --> 12:14.330
That's dark.

12:14.364 --> 12:16.565
Yeah, well, that's how it
worked when I was in the field.

12:16.600 --> 12:17.800
Now it's all digital.

12:17.834 --> 12:19.602
That so? Go on.

12:21.405 --> 12:24.907
"C'thulu - Former Soldiers
of the French Foreign Legion."

12:24.941 --> 12:27.610
"White Wolves Professional"...
they're all paramilitary.

12:27.644 --> 12:29.478
All professional contract killers

12:29.513 --> 12:31.080
well-known to the NSA.

12:31.114 --> 12:33.849
So we're thinking somebody paid one
of these mercs to kill Leslie?

12:33.884 --> 12:34.950
Kirsten: I don't know.

12:34.985 --> 12:37.920
Hipster Guy was far from
paramilitary or professional.

12:37.954 --> 12:39.055
I mean, he was so nervous,

12:39.089 --> 12:40.389
he could hardly hold the knife steady.

12:41.925 --> 12:43.693
- The knife.
- What about it?

12:43.727 --> 12:46.062
It had a distinctive look.
It was, sort of, um...

12:46.096 --> 12:47.930
round, thin at the base.

12:47.964 --> 12:50.800
Round? Like a pizza slicer?

12:50.834 --> 12:52.435
No. More oval.

12:52.469 --> 12:54.403
Uh, pointed at the end. It was almost...

12:54.438 --> 12:56.972
Weighted, thin base, oval blade.

12:57.007 --> 12:59.141
- (beeps)
- Throwing knife.

12:59.176 --> 13:00.509
Kirsten: That's it.

13:00.544 --> 13:02.344
That seems a bit inefficient.

13:02.379 --> 13:04.180
Not if that's what he was told to use.

13:04.214 --> 13:05.281
Try to make a point.

13:05.315 --> 13:07.450
Mm, and if you wanted to make a point...

13:07.484 --> 13:10.086
You'd make sure you saw
said point being made.

13:10.120 --> 13:12.421
So, whoever Hipster
streamed the video to

13:12.456 --> 13:14.690
could have told him to use that knife.

13:14.725 --> 13:16.225
Well, there's always Option B.

13:16.259 --> 13:18.894
Maybe throwing knives is just, you know,

13:18.929 --> 13:20.262
just his hipster thing.

13:20.297 --> 13:21.864
Like craft beardwax?

13:21.898 --> 13:23.499
Brewing your own kombucha?

13:23.533 --> 13:25.167
Exactly... I think.

13:25.202 --> 13:27.369
Okay. Either way,
contract killer's what we got

13:27.404 --> 13:28.771
until we get something better.

13:28.805 --> 13:30.606
Camille, Linus, darknet. Live in it.

13:30.640 --> 13:32.708
Look for video chatter.

13:32.743 --> 13:34.744
Anything that resembles Leslie's death.

13:34.778 --> 13:37.246
You two, talk to Monica.
Find out what she knows.

13:37.280 --> 13:39.648
My office. I have something
I need you to follow-up on.

13:52.016 --> 13:53.061
What?

13:53.139 --> 13:55.608
Just making sure
I'm not standing on plastic.

13:55.699 --> 13:58.834
Just a little "My boss is a
former killer for the CIA" humor.

13:58.869 --> 14:00.469
- You finished?
- I am.

14:00.504 --> 14:01.971
The team. They cut out Ivy.

14:02.005 --> 14:03.973
Apparently, she was behind the anomaly

14:04.007 --> 14:05.741
that trapped Kirsten
in that memory loop.

14:05.776 --> 14:07.343
- I thought that was Stinger.
- I did too.

14:07.377 --> 14:09.411
Think she's playing us?

14:09.446 --> 14:10.913
Hard to say.

14:10.947 --> 14:13.115
Maybe it's time we bring Kirsten
and Cameron up to speed.

14:13.150 --> 14:14.717
I can't do that.

14:14.751 --> 14:16.519
How long you gonna
keep them at arm's length?

14:16.553 --> 14:18.354
This may be your best and only shot

14:18.388 --> 14:20.256
at actually stopping Daniel Stinger.

14:20.290 --> 14:21.690
Use all your resources.

14:21.725 --> 14:23.692
- They're not kids, Maggie.
- (sighs)

14:23.727 --> 14:25.361
It is too dangerous.

14:25.395 --> 14:27.196
Keeping this team safe is one of the few

14:27.230 --> 14:29.732
really good things
that I have done in my life,

14:29.766 --> 14:32.101
and I am not going to compromise it,

14:32.135 --> 14:33.502
not even to get Stinger.

14:33.537 --> 14:34.770
I get it.

14:34.805 --> 14:36.639
And you're not alone in this, okay?

14:37.707 --> 14:38.707
I know.

14:40.243 --> 14:43.045
The truth is I haven't felt alone
since you joined the team.

14:44.147 --> 14:46.982
None of this works
without you. I mean that.

14:47.017 --> 14:49.118
Come on.

14:49.152 --> 14:51.620
Any LAPD detective could do my job.

14:51.655 --> 14:55.090
Come on, Quincy, you know
you're more than just a job.

14:56.459 --> 14:58.294
The team, they look to you.
They need you.

14:59.863 --> 15:01.430
They do, do they?

15:02.499 --> 15:03.599
(phone rings)

15:06.837 --> 15:08.838
- I should take this.
- Of course.

15:09.873 --> 15:11.407
How's our nation's capitol?

15:11.441 --> 15:13.075
Stephanie: <i>Like LA, just...</i>

15:13.109 --> 15:15.444
cold six months out of the year.

15:15.478 --> 15:18.214
Hopefully, I'll have someone
warm next to me soon.

15:18.248 --> 15:19.682
(sighs)

15:19.716 --> 15:21.517
I'll let you know soon. I promise.

15:21.551 --> 15:23.853
Quincy, are we trying
to make this work or not?

15:23.887 --> 15:25.020
<i>We are.</i>

15:25.055 --> 15:27.790
I just need some time
to figure things out on my end.

15:27.824 --> 15:29.859
- Okay?
- Okay.

15:35.799 --> 15:37.733
- I'll call you tomorrow.
<i>- Okay.</i>

15:39.436 --> 15:40.436

15:43.707 --> 15:45.574

15:45.609 --> 15:47.076

15:49.546 --> 15:50.880

16:03.159 --> 16:04.793
I'll be making my decision soon.

16:05.962 --> 16:06.962
Cameron: Practice?

16:08.265 --> 16:09.431
Try-outs.

16:09.466 --> 16:11.767
For Leslie's replacement?
That's kind fast, yeah?

16:11.801 --> 16:13.302
Sorry. Who... who are you?

16:13.336 --> 16:15.604
Agent Clark and Goodkin, NSA.

16:15.639 --> 16:16.972
So, as I was saying,

16:17.007 --> 16:18.207
it's a little bit soon to be looking

16:18.241 --> 16:19.441
for a replacement for Leslie.

16:19.476 --> 16:21.510
If she was my spouse, maybe,

16:21.544 --> 16:23.379
but being a pro-athlete is a business...

16:23.413 --> 16:25.848
a business that doesn't stop
even when we lose somebody.

16:25.882 --> 16:28.350
And Leslie was my teammate,
not my friend.

16:28.385 --> 16:30.586
All right, so let's talk
stalkers and steroids.

16:30.620 --> 16:32.588
If you're asking if I'm doing
steroids, no, I'm not.

16:32.622 --> 16:34.757
And as far as a stalker
killing Leslie...

16:34.791 --> 16:36.258
your guess is as good as mine.

16:36.293 --> 16:38.127
Recall anyone following her?

16:38.161 --> 16:40.296
Uh, lingering around your matches?

16:40.330 --> 16:41.597
Hipster guy, beard?

16:41.631 --> 16:43.933
You just described like 80%
of the guys in LA.

16:43.967 --> 16:45.267
But no.

16:45.302 --> 16:46.835
No one that stands out in my mind.

16:46.870 --> 16:48.671
- Cameron: Mmm.
- I know what you guys are thinking.

16:48.705 --> 16:50.272
I should probably be more broken up

16:50.307 --> 16:51.373
about Leslie being dead,

16:51.408 --> 16:53.909
but... I'm not.

16:53.944 --> 16:55.177
And that doesn't mean I killed her.

16:55.211 --> 16:58.247
I just don't...
I don't care all that much.

16:59.482 --> 17:01.583
I gotta go. Are we... we're done?

17:01.618 --> 17:04.553
- For now.
- Cool.

17:04.587 --> 17:07.388
Guess people deal with grief
in different ways.

17:07.424 --> 17:08.656
You think she's innocent?

17:08.692 --> 17:11.093
Of being a nihilistic ass, no.

17:11.127 --> 17:12.895
- (phone ringing)
- Being a murderer, not sure.

17:14.230 --> 17:15.698
What's up, Maggie?

17:17.166 --> 17:18.367
Okay, we'll be there.

17:19.736 --> 17:21.436
A second body just came in.

17:29.089 --> 17:30.426
(whirring)

17:30.451 --> 17:32.237
Tim Carson, 30's.

17:32.311 --> 17:34.995
Talent agent found
shot to death in a parking lot.

17:35.029 --> 17:36.596
What's the connection to Leslie?

17:36.631 --> 17:38.899
There isn't one.
Not a detectable one anyway.

17:38.933 --> 17:41.001
Two separate cases at the same time?

17:41.035 --> 17:44.271
- That's weird.
- Ha. Wait'll you see the darknet.

17:44.305 --> 17:45.372
I'll pass.

17:45.406 --> 17:47.073
If we only knew who picked our cases,

17:47.108 --> 17:48.708
we wouldn't have to stand
around here wondering.

17:48.743 --> 17:50.477
We could call and find out.

17:50.511 --> 17:53.313
I'm not having that conversation again.
Do your job.

17:53.347 --> 17:55.549
Stitch in, and let's see
what we can find out.

17:58.386 --> 17:59.819
Remember our deal.

17:59.854 --> 18:02.556
- When this is over...
- Yes, your mother.

18:02.590 --> 18:04.224
I haven't forgotten.

18:04.258 --> 18:06.359
(equipment humming)

18:14.068 --> 18:15.201
What are you seeing, K?

18:15.236 --> 18:17.137
Carson's standing in front of me.

18:17.171 --> 18:20.040
(car honks)

18:20.074 --> 18:21.374
<i>He's looking at his phone.</i>

18:21.409 --> 18:23.209
His bank accounts
are all in the negative.

18:24.779 --> 18:27.314
He's not alone anymore.

18:27.348 --> 18:28.648
You know I'm good for it.

18:28.683 --> 18:31.284
- I wasn't ducking...
- You don't answer my calls for a week.

18:31.319 --> 18:33.486
Then you call me to come here?

18:33.521 --> 18:36.022
You think I got a problem
with kicking your ass in public?

18:36.057 --> 18:37.991
This bet was a lock.
They should have covered...

18:38.025 --> 18:40.560
Shut up... or pay up.

18:40.595 --> 18:41.695
What's going on?

18:41.729 --> 18:43.897
Carson's getting worked
over by the thug.

18:43.931 --> 18:45.932
He... he owes him money, gambling debt.

18:45.967 --> 18:47.601
Okay, new memory coming in hot.

18:47.635 --> 18:49.169
On the road, K.

18:53.174 --> 18:54.774
You think you can just walk away?

18:54.809 --> 18:57.310
Make yourself disappear
like one of your magic tricks?

18:57.345 --> 18:58.778
I own you!

18:58.813 --> 19:00.847
Carson's talking to a
client of his, a magician.

19:00.881 --> 19:03.283
No one knew who Heretic was
before you came to me.

19:03.317 --> 19:04.784
The magician's name is Heretic.

19:04.819 --> 19:05.952
On it.

19:08.089 --> 19:10.090
He seems nervous, on edge.

19:11.092 --> 19:12.926
Actually, he seems kinda familiar.

19:12.960 --> 19:14.027
Oh my God.

19:14.061 --> 19:16.029
It's him. It's the guy
that killed Leslie.

19:16.063 --> 19:17.430
Are you sure?

19:17.465 --> 19:18.898
No one knows who I am now.

19:19.934 --> 19:21.701
Let me out of my contract, or I swear...

19:21.736 --> 19:23.737
Yep. He's got another throwing knife.

19:23.771 --> 19:24.871
He's threatening Carson.

19:24.905 --> 19:26.473
Is this the death memory?

19:26.507 --> 19:27.574
No.

19:27.608 --> 19:29.943
Oh, grow up.

19:29.977 --> 19:31.111
You signed a contract.

19:31.145 --> 19:33.313
Like it or not, I'm your manager.

19:33.347 --> 19:37.083
Threaten me again, I'll make
sure your career vanishes...

19:37.118 --> 19:38.585
before your very eyes.

19:38.619 --> 19:40.053
Death memory coming up.

19:40.087 --> 19:41.588
Okay. Here we go, K.

19:43.457 --> 19:45.058
Carson's in a parking lot.

19:45.092 --> 19:46.793
He's walking to his car.

19:46.827 --> 19:47.861
30 seconds.

19:47.895 --> 19:49.295
It's going down, K.

19:50.564 --> 19:52.132
There's no killer here.

19:53.134 --> 19:55.035
- Unless...
- Unless what?

19:55.069 --> 19:56.870
Um, there's a suburban average Joe type

19:56.904 --> 19:58.338
getting out of a SUV.

19:58.372 --> 19:59.606
Excuse me.

20:00.841 --> 20:03.910
I'm... I'm... I'm looking for the, uh...

20:03.944 --> 20:06.212
He's talking to Carson,
asking for directions.

20:06.247 --> 20:07.647
Carson doesn't know him.

20:07.682 --> 20:09.416
- Ten seconds.
- Time to go.

20:09.450 --> 20:10.450
Wait, wait, wait. There's a...

20:10.484 --> 20:12.152
there's a bumper sticker on the SUV.

20:12.186 --> 20:15.422
It says "My kid is an A+ student
at Acton Middle School."

20:17.491 --> 20:19.259
(cocks)

20:19.293 --> 20:20.460
(gunshot)

20:24.832 --> 20:26.499
(rapid beeping)

20:30.571 --> 20:31.838
So, what is the connection

20:31.872 --> 20:33.840
between our two unconnected victims?

20:33.874 --> 20:35.475
And the connection
between their killers.

20:35.509 --> 20:36.810
Or the connection between all of 'em.

20:36.844 --> 20:38.378
A volleyball player who threatens

20:38.412 --> 20:40.714
to out her teammate for using steroids

20:40.748 --> 20:42.916
and gets stabbed to death by a magician.

20:42.950 --> 20:44.684
That same magician
wants to drop his manager

20:44.719 --> 20:46.019
who gets killed by a soccer dad.

20:46.053 --> 20:48.021
In both cases,
someone wanted someone dead,

20:48.055 --> 20:49.689
but someone else did the killing.

20:49.724 --> 20:52.125
And they all broadcast it
live on their phones.

20:52.159 --> 20:53.788
Could be a kill competition.

20:53.835 --> 20:54.958
Murder for sport?

20:54.982 --> 20:56.730
Maggie: Camille, any luck
with our latest killer?

20:56.731 --> 20:58.498
Well, I don't normally
speak suburbanite,

20:58.532 --> 21:01.234
but that bumper sticker
was unbelievably specific.

21:01.268 --> 21:03.303
I crossed it with Kirsten's
description of the SUV

21:03.337 --> 21:05.405
and got a name and address
for a Patrick Richmond.

21:05.439 --> 21:07.207
Alright, good work.
Okay, Kirsten, Cameron,

21:07.241 --> 21:09.042
come with me to pick up
Patrick Richmond.

21:09.076 --> 21:10.944
Fisher, you and Camille
get the magician.

21:10.978 --> 21:11.978
We'll work our magic.

21:13.214 --> 21:15.048
Keep digging into the darknet.

21:15.082 --> 21:16.649
Consider it done.

21:21.655 --> 21:23.790
Fisher: Man, I love old theaters.

21:23.824 --> 21:25.525
Heck, I like even magic show.

21:25.559 --> 21:29.229
And the improbable "Fisher
Likes" list continues to grow.

21:29.263 --> 21:30.930
You know how they cut a woman in half?

21:30.965 --> 21:32.565
Pair her up with a man.

21:38.005 --> 21:39.405
(exhales)

21:39.440 --> 21:42.842
Ahh. Heretic, I presume.

21:42.877 --> 21:45.078
- Hey.
- I'm Detective Fisher, LAPD.

21:45.112 --> 21:47.013
This is Agent Engelson of the NSA.

21:47.047 --> 21:48.581
We'd like to ask you a few questions.

21:48.616 --> 21:50.116
Questions?

21:50.151 --> 21:52.051
Magicians don't give away their secrets.

21:52.086 --> 21:54.120
Maybe for us you can make an exception.

21:54.155 --> 21:56.656
We'd like to talk to you about
Tim Carson and Leslie Addams.

21:56.690 --> 21:58.491
Look, I didn't like Carson very much,

21:58.526 --> 21:59.859
but I didn't kill him.

21:59.894 --> 22:01.694
Same goes with Leslie Addams.

22:01.729 --> 22:03.930
Hmm! I guess it would
make sense that you would, uh,

22:03.964 --> 22:05.999
know your manager was murdered,

22:06.033 --> 22:07.600
but how'd you know Leslie was too?

22:07.635 --> 22:09.102
I just assumed the way that you...

22:09.136 --> 22:11.070
linked her together with Carson.

22:11.105 --> 22:12.405
(grunts)

22:13.908 --> 22:15.241
Ah! Don't! Don't!

22:15.276 --> 22:16.509
I can throw faster than you can draw,

22:16.544 --> 22:18.077
and this time
I will not miss on purpose.

22:18.112 --> 22:19.512
Alright, take it easy.

22:19.547 --> 22:21.581
You know, you're only making
things worse for yourself.

22:21.615 --> 22:23.983
You don't know the players
in this game, man.

22:24.018 --> 22:26.252
They're worse than anything
that you can do to me.

22:26.287 --> 22:27.453
(grunts)

22:27.488 --> 22:28.955
- (grunts)
- God! (screams)

22:30.958 --> 22:32.425
Worse than that?

22:32.459 --> 22:35.695
- (moaning)
- (applause)

22:35.729 --> 22:37.297
It's all in the reflexes.

22:49.314 --> 22:50.789
The moments we wish

22:50.814 --> 22:53.329
we could disappear from, right, buddy?

22:53.392 --> 22:55.267
He tried to kill us with the
same type of throwing knife

22:55.292 --> 22:56.345
he used on Leslie.

22:56.385 --> 22:58.786
Okay. So, we know
who killed Leslie and how,

22:58.820 --> 23:00.388
- but...
- But we don't know why.

23:00.422 --> 23:01.489
Exactly.

23:01.523 --> 23:03.430
We brought this guy,
Patrick Richmond, in.

23:03.472 --> 23:05.439
30s, no police record.

23:05.474 --> 23:06.908
Never even been arrested.

23:06.942 --> 23:08.943
Unlikely contract killer.

23:08.977 --> 23:10.344
Maybe. The guy's been unemployed,

23:10.379 --> 23:12.580
and he's been fighting a long
custody battle with his ex-wife

23:12.614 --> 23:14.649
over their two young kids.
Maybe that could lead to murder?

23:14.683 --> 23:17.469
Of his wife, maybe,
but a stranger? Mm-mm.

23:17.500 --> 23:19.538
Well, she remarried some guy
with deep pockets,

23:19.588 --> 23:21.389
and they just filed
for full custody out of state.

23:21.423 --> 23:23.024
Patrick's been spending
all his time and money

23:23.058 --> 23:24.559
on lawyers fighting
to get his kids back.

23:24.593 --> 23:25.826
So, he needs money.

23:25.861 --> 23:27.628
Well, maybe he's willing to kill for it.

23:27.663 --> 23:29.263
All right, we're on our way to the lab.

23:37.139 --> 23:38.940
Linus: Look what you did, Patrick.

23:38.974 --> 23:40.474
You murdered Tim Carson.

23:40.509 --> 23:42.310
I-I didn't do that.

23:42.344 --> 23:43.844
I-I don't even know this guy.

23:43.879 --> 23:44.979
That's what we can't figure out.

23:45.013 --> 23:46.881
Why would you kill a stranger?

23:46.915 --> 23:47.949
I'm no killer.

23:47.983 --> 23:49.450
Your SUV was seen at the crime.

23:49.484 --> 23:51.719
And they swabbed your hands
for gunshot residue.

23:51.753 --> 23:53.354
Those test results
are coming back real soon.

23:53.388 --> 23:56.390
Kirsten: Look, we know your
custody fight has been difficult.

23:56.425 --> 23:59.226
You're a loving father whose daughters
are about to be taken away.

23:59.261 --> 24:00.795
I know what that
can do to a little girl.

24:03.799 --> 24:05.700
I thought I could do this
as long as I didn't know them.

24:05.734 --> 24:08.202
- What do you mean "them"?
- Oh, I must be out of my goddamn mind.

24:08.236 --> 24:09.904
What did you do, Patrick?

24:09.938 --> 24:11.639
Ah, I...

24:11.673 --> 24:15.176
signed up for this website... All In.

24:15.210 --> 24:17.612
I mean, you... you hear
about sites like this existing,

24:17.646 --> 24:19.947
but you... you don't think
it's real until it's...

24:19.982 --> 24:21.182
there it is,

24:21.216 --> 24:22.917
as real as it gets, right
there in front of your face.

24:22.951 --> 24:24.852
Okay. Hold on. What's All In?

24:24.886 --> 24:29.123
It's a criss-cross murder business

24:29.157 --> 24:31.993
for people who can't afford a...

24:32.027 --> 24:33.494
Hit man.

24:37.199 --> 24:40.468
You have someone you want killed, so...

24:40.502 --> 24:42.470
you agree to murder a complete stranger

24:42.504 --> 24:44.238
who someone else wants killed,

24:44.272 --> 24:46.707
and... and... and
they kill someone else.

24:46.742 --> 24:48.242
It's like a twisted "Pay It Forward."

24:48.276 --> 24:49.777
There's no backing out.

24:49.811 --> 24:51.746
If you don't complete the contract,

24:51.780 --> 24:54.582
All In sends a compliance officer.

24:54.616 --> 24:55.983
The penalty is death.

24:56.018 --> 24:58.052
Look, I like corporate structure
as much as the next guy,

24:58.086 --> 24:59.420
but a compliance officer?

24:59.454 --> 25:00.521
That's what he's called.

25:00.555 --> 25:02.490
And that's why
you have to livestream it?

25:02.524 --> 25:04.558
Prove that you completed the assignment.

25:04.593 --> 25:06.727
Okay, well, if you kill Carson,

25:06.762 --> 25:08.162
then who did you want...

25:09.264 --> 25:10.464
Your ex-wife.

25:17.406 --> 25:18.606
Cameron: Right. That was Maggie.

25:18.640 --> 25:20.975
They just arrested Monica,
the pro-volleyball player,

25:21.009 --> 25:23.244
right before she tried to hit
Patrick's wife with her car.

25:23.278 --> 25:25.146
Monica got the contract on her.

25:25.180 --> 25:27.014
Then we've officially come full circle.

25:27.049 --> 25:29.283
That should put a stop to this
strange daisy chain anyway.

25:29.317 --> 25:31.819
Although stopping the chain
won't stop the problem.

25:31.853 --> 25:34.255
- The problem being All In.
- Oh, we know all about it.

25:34.289 --> 25:35.990
Heretic had the All In app on his phone.

25:36.024 --> 25:37.158
- The app?
- Camille: Mmm.

25:37.192 --> 25:39.326
And how's this for Web 3.OMG?

25:42.431 --> 25:44.432
I think I know how we stop All In.

25:45.801 --> 25:48.069
- We sign up.
- Excuse me?

25:48.103 --> 25:49.303
Well, it's an idea.

25:49.337 --> 25:50.471
Glad you like it.

25:50.505 --> 25:52.239
So to sign up, put in our name,

25:52.274 --> 25:53.708
and then the name and details

25:53.742 --> 25:55.543
of the person that we want killed.

25:55.577 --> 25:56.871
Then I assume in return you're sent

25:56.895 --> 25:58.212
the name and particulars of the person

25:58.213 --> 26:01.048
you're supposed to kill within
a specific period of time.

26:01.083 --> 26:03.417
Exactly. So if we go all in on All In,

26:03.452 --> 26:04.785
we should be assigned someone to murder.

26:04.820 --> 26:06.487
But then we refuse
to go through with the hit?

26:06.521 --> 26:07.621
And then we sit back and wait

26:07.656 --> 26:09.023
for the compliance officer to come.

26:09.057 --> 26:10.658
Exactly. We capture that scumbag,

26:10.692 --> 26:11.792
bring him in for questioning.

26:11.827 --> 26:12.860
If we can get them to talk,

26:12.894 --> 26:14.628
we could follow that lead
all the way up to the top.

26:14.663 --> 26:17.031
- Nope. I don't like it.
- Me neither. It's too risky.

26:17.065 --> 26:18.099
- Linus: Oh, come on!
- No.

26:18.133 --> 26:20.701
Okay. Yeah. It was just an idea.

26:20.736 --> 26:22.636
- Pretty good one, but...
- (beeps)

26:22.671 --> 26:23.904
Uh-oh.

26:24.906 --> 26:26.173
Linus, what'd you do?

26:26.208 --> 26:28.008
You signed up?

26:28.043 --> 26:29.043
No.

26:30.078 --> 26:31.391
I signed Camille up.

26:36.372 --> 26:38.111
_

26:46.165 --> 26:47.657
I cannot believe

26:47.658 --> 26:49.902
you signed me up to be a hitman.

26:49.957 --> 26:51.284
- Hitwoman.
- Whatever.

26:51.309 --> 26:53.470
I was simulating. Not doing.

26:53.495 --> 26:55.514
We were discussing
hypothetically signing up.

26:55.569 --> 26:57.577
I filled in your name
for demonstration purposes.

26:57.660 --> 26:58.692
Why me?

26:58.725 --> 27:00.851
- I thought you said it was a good idea.
- Not that part.

27:00.876 --> 27:02.210
It must have been
an automatic registration.

27:02.235 --> 27:03.471
As soon as you enter the last field,

27:03.507 --> 27:05.340
it must have registered you without
having to hit a submit button.

27:05.375 --> 27:07.208
Well, that's how they
drag people into the program.

27:07.244 --> 27:09.606
Okay, so who is Camille
supposed to kill?

27:11.214 --> 27:13.114
Oh, good. An LA County judge.

27:13.150 --> 27:15.216
Fisher: Okay, who did you say
you wanted Camille to kill?

27:15.252 --> 27:17.755
Uh, good thing is I put
my name down for that.

27:17.982 --> 27:20.255
Oh, well, at this moment, very accurate.

27:23.493 --> 27:25.052
Yes, Maggie.

27:25.328 --> 27:26.995
Seriously, thank you.

27:27.030 --> 27:29.130
Uh, I mean, maybe
after this is all over,

27:29.166 --> 27:30.898
I could take you out to dinner, and...

27:32.502 --> 27:33.694
Okay.

27:34.137 --> 27:35.470
She hung up.

27:35.874 --> 27:38.440
She picked up the judge.
She's under protective custody.

27:38.636 --> 27:40.627
She's a total trooper. She was
grateful for the heads up

27:40.652 --> 27:42.425
that she was on the
wrong end of a kill list.

27:43.380 --> 27:45.080
(sighs)

27:45.115 --> 27:47.420
I guess now we just wait
for All In to call and...

27:47.491 --> 27:50.591
You signed me up to be a killer.

27:50.828 --> 27:53.796
You signed yourself up to be killed.

27:53.831 --> 27:56.528
The NSA already pulled
the plug on the All In site.

27:56.567 --> 27:59.635
Besides, you and I
are in a government facility

27:59.670 --> 28:01.112
protected by a SWAT team

28:01.167 --> 28:03.172
20 stories underneath
a Chinese restaurant.

28:04.308 --> 28:06.109
We're gonna be fine...

28:06.143 --> 28:08.311
as long as we don't order
the moo goo gai pan.

28:09.747 --> 28:11.447
That supposed to make me feel better?

28:11.497 --> 28:13.950
(ringing)

28:15.452 --> 28:17.120
Do you think it's...?

28:17.154 --> 28:18.588
'Bout to find out.

28:24.094 --> 28:25.728
- Ready.
- (beeps)

28:26.930 --> 28:28.331
Hello?

28:28.365 --> 28:30.133
<i>(distorted voice)
Is this Camille Engelson?</i>

28:30.167 --> 28:31.534
Yes.

28:31.568 --> 28:34.604
<i>This is customer service for All In.</i>

28:34.638 --> 28:36.672
<i>We'd like to thank you
for your business.</i>

28:36.707 --> 28:38.007
Oh my God!

28:38.041 --> 28:40.042
You guys! I'm so glad you called.

28:40.077 --> 28:42.812
I totally signed up by mistake.

28:42.846 --> 28:44.647
Thought you were a poker website.

28:44.681 --> 28:45.915
I don't want anyone killed,

28:45.949 --> 28:48.317
and I'm not a killer! (chuckles) So...

28:48.352 --> 28:50.052
(groans) sorry?

28:50.087 --> 28:51.521
<i>That's a problem.</i>

28:51.555 --> 28:53.322
<i>Per the terms of our agreement,</i>

28:53.357 --> 28:56.526
<i>the penalty for reneging
on your contract is death.</i>

28:56.560 --> 28:58.394
You know that's a little harsh, right?

28:58.428 --> 29:00.897
Cable just cancels your subscription.

29:00.931 --> 29:02.832
Our terms are very clear.

29:02.866 --> 29:04.233
Well, then, I guess...

29:04.268 --> 29:06.702
you should probably come down
and kill me then.

29:07.738 --> 29:10.640
We never said it was your death.

29:10.674 --> 29:12.074
- (phone hangs up)
- (disconnected line)

29:12.109 --> 29:14.076
No. Wait, wait, wait, wait.

29:15.979 --> 29:17.079
Did you get a location?

29:18.182 --> 29:19.482
No.

29:19.516 --> 29:21.317
Start calling everyone.

29:21.351 --> 29:23.586

30:37.294 --> 30:38.628
It's gonna be great tonight.

30:52.943 --> 30:54.944
Are you Detective Quincy Fisher?

30:54.978 --> 30:56.812
Who's asking?

30:58.015 --> 31:00.016
I'm Kate Ronan.

31:00.050 --> 31:01.617
The person behind All In.

31:02.819 --> 31:03.986
And I surrender.

31:16.635 --> 31:17.969
(door opens)

31:24.109 --> 31:26.313
Special furniture just for you.

31:26.360 --> 31:28.261
Kate Ronan.

31:28.295 --> 31:30.096
It's been a long time, Maggie.

31:30.131 --> 31:31.531
Twelve years off grid.

31:32.833 --> 31:34.434
And now here you are.

31:34.468 --> 31:36.669
What's the deal with Detective Fisher?

31:36.704 --> 31:37.804
He's dreamy.

31:37.838 --> 31:40.340
He's right outside the door,
so don't try anything.

31:40.374 --> 31:42.442
So, how'd you know
to turn yourself in to him?

31:42.476 --> 31:46.112
Once I knew NSA was on to me,
I did some checking.

31:46.147 --> 31:48.314
I still know people who know people.

31:48.349 --> 31:49.749
Maybe I should warn him

31:49.784 --> 31:51.684
about what happens
to people who work with you?

31:52.686 --> 31:54.320
What do you think?

31:54.355 --> 31:56.222
- I think you haven't changed a bit.
- Aw.

31:56.257 --> 31:59.392
But you have. From CIA Black Ops

31:59.427 --> 32:01.795
to the NSA power player.

32:01.829 --> 32:04.931
- You've been busy.
- And so have you.

32:04.965 --> 32:08.234
Extortion, kidnapping.

32:08.269 --> 32:09.936
Murder.

32:09.970 --> 32:12.405
And now this whole
contract-killing business.

32:13.674 --> 32:16.342
Remember how lethal you used to be?

32:16.377 --> 32:18.278
What I did, I did for my country.

32:18.312 --> 32:19.979
Call it what you want.

32:20.014 --> 32:22.215
You were just doing
other people's dirty work.

32:24.285 --> 32:26.219
Is that why you started All In?

32:26.253 --> 32:29.355
To tempt broken people into
doing each others' dirty work.

32:29.390 --> 32:30.523
Maggie...

32:30.558 --> 32:31.925
we both know that at some point,

32:31.959 --> 32:33.560
everyone wants to get rid of someone.

32:33.594 --> 32:36.196
Problem is, most people
don't have the money

32:36.230 --> 32:37.964
or the power to make it happen.

32:38.999 --> 32:41.668
All In just evens the playing field.

32:41.702 --> 32:43.837
Your app was downloaded
hundreds of times.

32:43.871 --> 32:45.138
If we hadn't stopped you,

32:45.172 --> 32:47.407
a lot more people
would have been killed.

32:47.441 --> 32:50.643
You almost got me killed once...

32:50.678 --> 32:54.180
back when you and I
were rising stars in the CIA.

32:54.215 --> 32:55.315
Remember?

32:55.349 --> 32:57.250
Don't live in the past.
It's not healthy.

32:57.284 --> 32:58.952
You were team leader.

33:00.154 --> 33:01.688
You planned the mission.

33:01.722 --> 33:03.823
They overtook our safe house.
We had to run.

33:05.192 --> 33:07.026
You didn't make it to the pickup point,

33:07.061 --> 33:09.496
so don't blame me, blame yourself.

33:09.530 --> 33:11.397
I made it...

33:11.432 --> 33:13.032
just in time to see you

33:13.067 --> 33:15.301
and the rest of the team
get airlifted out.

33:18.205 --> 33:19.405
I'm sorry, Kate.

33:19.440 --> 33:22.008
You know you saw me from the chopper...

33:23.177 --> 33:24.511
and you still left.

33:24.545 --> 33:26.446
If I had waited and we were shot down,

33:26.480 --> 33:28.481
it would have started
an international incident.

33:28.516 --> 33:30.049
I knew you could take care of yourself.

33:30.084 --> 33:32.685
You broke the cardinal rule, Maggie.

33:32.720 --> 33:34.554
Never leave a team member behind.

33:34.588 --> 33:36.322
I can't change the past.

33:36.357 --> 33:38.992
Then at least have the decency
to be haunted by it.

33:40.361 --> 33:41.594
Every day.

33:45.232 --> 33:47.467
I always knew we'd meet again someday.

33:51.172 --> 33:53.006
Well, welcome to someday.

34:05.419 --> 34:06.753
What's up?

34:08.922 --> 34:10.657
We worked together.

34:10.690 --> 34:12.859
CIA. There was a mission...

34:12.893 --> 34:14.960
Fisher: <i>I don't need to know.</i>

34:14.995 --> 34:16.795
Look, you may have worked
with that woman in the past,

34:16.830 --> 34:18.565
but you are nothing like her, Maggie.

34:18.599 --> 34:19.799
I don't know, Quincy.

34:19.833 --> 34:22.635
What... if we can't escape our past?

34:22.670 --> 34:25.572
What if we are doomed
to repeating the same mistakes?

34:25.606 --> 34:27.239
I don't believe that.

34:27.274 --> 34:28.608
Our fate is our own.

34:28.641 --> 34:30.510
Can mess up however we want.

34:30.543 --> 34:31.945
(glass shatters)

34:31.978 --> 34:33.079
Kate!

34:42.889 --> 34:43.989
She has his gun.

34:49.830 --> 34:51.797
- (glass shatters)
- (klaxon blaring)

34:51.831 --> 34:53.166
She can't get out.

34:55.335 --> 34:57.303
(power dies)

34:57.338 --> 34:59.172
How was she in the lab
long enough to cut the power?

34:59.206 --> 35:01.341
She is exactly as smart as she looks.

35:01.375 --> 35:02.875
(gunfire)

35:07.948 --> 35:09.482
You okay?

35:09.516 --> 35:10.950
Maggie: There's no way out, Kate!

35:12.853 --> 35:14.721
Kate: I knew this was gonna
be a suicide mission,

35:14.755 --> 35:16.556
but it'll be worth it
when I see you dead.

35:16.590 --> 35:18.124
(whispers) Flank her.

35:21.829 --> 35:23.930
Kate: You never should've
left me to die, Maggie.

35:37.511 --> 35:38.811
Kate!

35:38.846 --> 35:40.280
Put the gun down.

35:57.364 --> 35:59.132
Thanks for having my back.

36:00.734 --> 36:01.968
(sighs)

36:10.644 --> 36:11.778
Are you okay?

36:13.547 --> 36:14.914
Recovering.

36:16.550 --> 36:18.718
Kate was willing
to sacrifice her own life

36:18.752 --> 36:21.187
out of sheer hatred for you.

36:25.526 --> 36:26.859
Yes.

36:26.894 --> 36:30.163
Because she trusted me
and I betrayed her.

36:30.197 --> 36:32.498
I don't want the same thing
to happen with us, Kirsten.

36:32.533 --> 36:35.034
Kind of a long shot.
I don't really like guns.

36:35.069 --> 36:36.536
(chuckles)

36:36.570 --> 36:38.805
Well, that's good to know.

36:38.839 --> 36:42.975
But, regardless. We had a deal.
The case is over.

36:43.010 --> 36:44.711
Your mother is in a secure facility.

36:44.745 --> 36:47.013
I'm going to arrange
for you to see her, but...

36:47.047 --> 36:49.215
- I need a few days.
- Why a few days?

36:49.249 --> 36:50.817
It's for your mother's own safety.

36:50.851 --> 36:51.951
I don't want to say more

36:51.985 --> 36:54.887
other than to ask that you
trust me one last time.

36:57.925 --> 36:59.125
A few days.

don't throw your drinks at me.

37:21.782 --> 37:24.150

I was surprised you called.

40:21.395 --> 40:23.362
I'm glad you wanted to meet.

40:23.397 --> 40:25.731
I'm afraid I have some bad news.

40:27.834 --> 40:30.403
The NSA is going
to terminate Jacqueline.

40:32.205 --> 40:33.472
(sighs)

40:36.276 --> 40:37.276
The last time we spoke,

40:37.311 --> 40:39.011
you didn't want anything to do with me.

40:40.047 --> 40:42.048
What's different now?

40:42.082 --> 40:43.349
Things have changed.

40:45.786 --> 40:49.021
Kirsten and... Linus and...

40:50.757 --> 40:52.124
They all hate me.

40:54.394 --> 40:55.828
You're my only real family.

40:56.830 --> 40:59.832

41:01.335 --> 41:02.868

41:05.205 --> 41:07.206
If they all hate you...

41:07.240 --> 41:10.076

41:10.110 --> 41:13.846

41:21.755 --> 41:23.950
