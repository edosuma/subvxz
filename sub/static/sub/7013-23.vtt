00:05.705 --> 00:07.639
Well, how are you
the morning?

00:08.641 --> 00:10.734
Well, my baby boy's still engaged.

00:10.810 --> 00:16.248
My hot flashes are back, so I feel like
I'm standing in a pool of burning lava.

00:16.315 --> 00:19.615
They don't make a pill for menopause,
so I took a Flintstone vitamin.

00:21.254 --> 00:23.415
And when you take a pill
shaped like Barney Rubble...

00:23.490 --> 00:26.926
it's pretty obvious the freakin' thing
ain't gonna work!

00:26.993 --> 00:30.520
Great. Anyway,
about the engagement...

00:30.597 --> 00:33.088
I've got Eric and Donna
on the ropes.

00:33.166 --> 00:36.465
I dared them
to get married next week.

00:36.536 --> 00:38.902
They were shaking like France.

00:38.972 --> 00:42.738
Well, I know you like scaring children,
but what's the point?

00:42.809 --> 00:45.334
Well, the point is if we let them do
what they want...

00:45.412 --> 00:47.880
they'll realize
they don't wanna do it.

00:47.947 --> 00:50.211
I mean, hell,
nobody wants to be married.

00:52.519 --> 00:55.886
Except me to you.
I'd do that all over again.

00:55.955 --> 00:58.423
Oh, is Steven here?

00:58.491 --> 01:01.585
He saw me on the couch with Michael,
but there was nothing going on.

01:01.661 --> 01:04.891
God, what do I do if he doesn't believe me,
Mr. Forman?

01:06.366 --> 01:08.596
- When in the hell did this start?
- I don't know.

01:10.070 --> 01:13.039
The kids all used to run from me.
That's the way I liked it.

01:13.106 --> 01:16.667
- [Whines]
- Well, next fall, you'll get your wish.

01:16.743 --> 01:20.440
Eric will be in college, and then the
whole house will be empty.

01:20.513 --> 01:23.038
That's right.

01:23.116 --> 01:26.677
We're only one good-bye
away from heaven.

01:26.753 --> 01:30.553
Mommy, Daddy, I'm home!

01:34.194 --> 01:36.594
We gotta start lockin' that door.

- Hi.

02:49.335 --> 02:54.363
Okay. If you had bad news that could hurt someone
that you cared about, what would you do?

02:54.440 --> 02:57.238
Kelso, just leave the poor girl
an anonymous note...

02:57.310 --> 02:59.904
and tell her she needs
a shot of penicillin.

02:59.979 --> 03:03.779
Donna. Okay.

03:03.850 --> 03:09.413
Someone I know cheated
on someone else I know.

03:11.791 --> 03:14.351
Did Eric cheat on me?

03:14.427 --> 03:16.895
I will snap that little monkey
like a twig!

03:16.963 --> 03:20.262
But no! Donna.

03:20.333 --> 03:23.302
God, Eric didn't cheat on you.

03:24.604 --> 03:26.572
- Hyde cheated on Jackie.
- What? Oh, my God!

03:26.639 --> 03:29.972
[High-pitched]
Yeah!

03:30.043 --> 03:33.012
And he doesn't know it, but I saw
him kissing this lady in the hotel.

03:33.079 --> 03:36.014
- Oh, my God. That is horrible.
- I wanna do the right thing, right?

03:36.082 --> 03:38.642
So I'm thinking that
I'll just teIIJackie.

03:38.718 --> 03:41.380
And then she'll feel really bad,
and I'll console her and presto!

03:41.454 --> 03:43.513
We'll be making out topless.

03:43.590 --> 03:45.956
No, Kelso.

03:46.025 --> 03:47.959
The thing to do is
to tell Hyde that you know...

03:48.027 --> 03:49.961
and then give him a chance
to teIIJackie.

03:50.029 --> 03:52.691
I knew you'd say that.
You know, just once...

03:52.765 --> 03:55.893
I want the right thing and the topless thing
to be the same thing.

04:06.312 --> 04:09.941
Well, if it isn't the lovebirds.

04:10.016 --> 04:14.578
So, lovebirds, how are
the big wedding plans coming along?

04:14.654 --> 04:19.421
Well, I've decided
to be the groom...

04:19.492 --> 04:23.724
and, uh, Donna's
gonna go with bride.

04:23.796 --> 04:27.095
Well, your mom and I
have made some plans too.

04:27.166 --> 04:31.626
We figure since we're already giving you
a graduation party...

04:31.704 --> 04:35.037
why not make it a wedding party too?

04:35.108 --> 04:37.804
Wait, graduation?

04:37.877 --> 04:41.745
- That's in a week, which is like-
- Seven days.

04:41.814 --> 04:44.339
- I know how long a week is.
- I know you know.

04:44.417 --> 04:48.786
Well, what's the matter? You two lovebirds
still wanna get married, don't you?

04:48.855 --> 04:51.722
I mean, heck, it'd be a real shame
if you chickened out.

04:51.791 --> 04:55.192
Then you'd be a couple
of love chickens.

04:57.897 --> 05:01.424
No. No, we wanna get married.

05:01.501 --> 05:03.731
Right, Donna?

05:03.803 --> 05:06.067
Of course.

05:06.139 --> 05:08.164
I do.

05:08.241 --> 05:10.971
Well, then it's settled.
We're having a wedding.

05:11.044 --> 05:13.171
[Laughs]

05:13.246 --> 05:16.215
Oh, Donna, you can wear
my wedding dress.

05:16.282 --> 05:18.580
It's off-white,
so nobody will whisper.

05:24.257 --> 05:26.953
Okay. What is going on
with them anyway?

05:27.026 --> 05:31.360
Eric, if you need any help
dealing with Mom and Dad...

05:31.431 --> 05:33.661
I'm here for you.

05:33.733 --> 05:36.998
Yeah. No, thanks.

05:37.070 --> 05:41.507
Last time I trusted you, I wound up in
the dryer with a pillowcase full of bees, so-

05:42.975 --> 05:46.172
I know, and I am so sorry.

05:46.245 --> 05:48.679
I have been cruel to you, Eric.

05:48.748 --> 05:50.841
You too, Donna,
but it wasn't as obvious...

05:50.917 --> 05:53.511
because I mostly said stuff
behind your back.

05:53.586 --> 05:55.520
Right back at ya.

05:57.090 --> 05:59.115
I'm not just home for a visit.

05:59.192 --> 06:03.561
I am here to correct the mistakes
that I have made in the past.

06:05.264 --> 06:08.495
Okay, but I'm sure
whatever bastard children you've had...

06:08.568 --> 06:10.627
have been adopted by now.

06:11.871 --> 06:14.772
Thank you.
Good luck to you.

06:14.841 --> 06:17.503
Hey, Fez.
I'm here to get my license.

06:17.577 --> 06:20.842
Oh, hello, Mitch.

06:22.749 --> 06:25.684
I'm here to tell you
that you will get... nothing!

06:26.953 --> 06:28.887
Okay, I know we had
our problems in wood shop...

06:28.955 --> 06:34.052
but for the hundredth time,
I'm sorry I sat on your spice rack.

06:34.127 --> 06:37.187
You're sorry?
You should see my kitchen.

06:37.263 --> 06:39.788
There's spices everywhere.
It's anarchy.

06:39.866 --> 06:42.130
Dude, you're getting hysterical
like a woman.

06:42.201 --> 06:44.726
Well, if you mean
that I am artistic and sensitive...

06:44.804 --> 06:48.638
and cry every time that I watch <i>Love Story,</i>
then, yes, I am like a woman.

06:53.279 --> 06:55.213
Now begone!

06:55.281 --> 06:59.741
You know, I could make it worth your while
if you would just give me the license.

06:59.819 --> 07:02.549
I'm the editor of the school paper.
Can you imagine this headline?

07:02.622 --> 07:05.182
"Foreign Kid Actually Cool."

07:06.926 --> 07:10.919
'Course, I'd have to retract it the next day,
because-Well, come on.

07:13.599 --> 07:17.330
Here's a headline for you:
"Short Kid Takes Long Walk."

07:23.543 --> 07:25.511
Well, hello, Hyde.

07:26.913 --> 07:29.973
I saw something very interesting
in the hotel this morning.

07:30.049 --> 07:32.950
Oh, the guy in the dress?

07:33.019 --> 07:34.987
That's Frank.
Comes in twice a month.

07:35.054 --> 07:38.080
Gets really pissed if you don't call him
Lady Laguna.

07:39.158 --> 07:41.092
No.

07:41.160 --> 07:43.253
I saw you kissing a girl
that wasn'tJackie.

07:43.329 --> 07:47.163
- Oh, that.
- Ah, so you admit it.

07:47.233 --> 07:49.167
- Sure.
- Don't try to deny it.

07:49.235 --> 07:53.638
- I won't.
- You're not gonna wiggle your way outta this one!

07:53.706 --> 07:59.110
I'm not trying to. Look, I cheated on Jackie,
'cause she cheated on me with you.

07:59.178 --> 08:01.112
Which reminds me,
I oughta kick your ass.

08:01.180 --> 08:04.308
Well, Hyde, we weren't doing anything.
I already told you.

08:04.383 --> 08:08.683
Jackie was comforting me, 'cause I was upset,
'cause Fez had a sex dream about me.

08:10.189 --> 08:12.589
Would you shut up
about that lame-ass story?

08:12.658 --> 08:14.819
Well, it's the truth, and I'll prove it.
Let's go ask Fez.

08:14.894 --> 08:16.987
- Fine.
- You drive. My van's in the shop.

08:17.063 --> 08:19.531
- Fine. I need gas though.
- Fine. Can I borrow money for fries?

08:19.599 --> 08:21.226
- No.
- Fine. Shotgun.

08:21.300 --> 08:23.530
- There's only two of us, you moron.
- Fine!

08:31.077 --> 08:33.203
You know what I think, Donna?

08:33.279 --> 08:36.043
I think this whole
"get married in a week" stuff...

08:36.115 --> 08:39.380
is just Red trying to get us
to call the whole thing off.

08:39.452 --> 08:42.011
Yeah.
But you know what?

08:42.087 --> 08:44.613
That ain't happening, missy.
You know what we're gonna do?

08:44.690 --> 08:47.352
We're gonna teach Red a lesson
and get married out of spite.

08:47.426 --> 08:50.020
Yeah, screw you, Red!

08:50.096 --> 08:52.860
Wow.

08:52.932 --> 08:55.560
It's every little girl's dream
to get married out of spite.

08:57.003 --> 08:59.301
You know what?

08:59.372 --> 09:01.306
I think maybe you're not ready
to get married.

09:01.374 --> 09:04.571
And if you're not,
you better tell me right now.

09:04.644 --> 09:07.306
Donna, I'm not ready.

09:07.380 --> 09:09.473
- Oh, thank God. Me neither.
- What?

09:09.549 --> 09:11.483
- I thought you were ready.
- I thought you were.

09:11.551 --> 09:12.882
- I'm not.
- Me neither.

09:12.952 --> 09:15.750
- Oh, my God, you are so hot.
- You are!

09:23.062 --> 09:26.498
Wow, nothing hits the spot
after an hour and a half of passion...

09:26.566 --> 09:29.592
like chili cheese fries.

09:31.137 --> 09:33.970
Oh, hello, Mitch.

09:34.040 --> 09:36.600
Had a nice walk over here?

09:38.210 --> 09:40.178
Get used to it because
you'll never get a license.

09:40.246 --> 09:43.682
- Do you understand me?
- No, but nobody understands you.

09:43.749 --> 09:46.240
You talk like Mushmouth
from <i>Fat Albert.</i>

09:46.319 --> 09:48.184
You just dug your own grave, fella.

09:48.254 --> 09:51.985
"I flug my own rave, bella"?
Was that what you said, Mushmouth?

09:52.058 --> 09:56.791
All right, Fez. I need you to tell Hyde
about the dream you had about me.

09:56.862 --> 09:59.695
What?

09:59.765 --> 10:02.666
I didn't have any dream.
[Mouths Words]

10:02.735 --> 10:04.999
We have a visitor.

10:06.505 --> 10:08.632
Fez, this is really important, okay?

10:08.708 --> 10:13.702
Start talking, or so help me, I'll give you
the worst purple nurple you've ever had.

10:15.648 --> 10:21.450
Okay. In my dream,
Kelso was dressed as a nurse...

10:23.022 --> 10:25.388
and he was giving me a sponge bath.

10:28.961 --> 10:30.986
And?

10:32.264 --> 10:34.198
I was nude.

10:35.701 --> 10:38.966
See?
I was really freaked out...

10:39.038 --> 10:41.370
and Jackie and me
were just talkin', that's all.

10:42.475 --> 10:44.443
So I just cheated
on Jackie for nothing?

10:44.510 --> 10:47.604
It's what I've been
telling you, man.

10:48.748 --> 10:50.909
Oh, Steven, look, okay?

10:50.983 --> 10:56.751
Whatever you think happened between me
and Michael, did not happen, okay?

10:56.822 --> 10:59.290
So, everything's fine.

10:59.358 --> 11:01.656
Actually, we need to talk.

11:03.295 --> 11:05.286
You know, I really hate to run...

11:05.364 --> 11:08.856
but I gotta go tell the whole school about
you and Nurse Ding-a-ling's sponge bath.

11:08.934 --> 11:10.868
So, I gotta go.

11:10.936 --> 11:15.236
- You wouldn't.
- "Blue blound't"? Move your lips, Mushmouth!

11:18.477 --> 11:21.241
So, I was in the den, and Michael
came over all upset.

11:21.313 --> 11:23.247
- Jackie.
- And, Steven, I asked him to leave.

11:23.315 --> 11:26.148
- And that's when you saw us.
But I swear, nothing happened.
- Jackie. Jackie!

11:26.218 --> 11:29.119
Stop talking.

11:29.188 --> 11:31.713
Look, I know all this now, okay?

11:33.526 --> 11:36.859
But before I knew,
I was at the hotel last night.

11:38.631 --> 11:40.963
And I was really mad.

11:43.536 --> 11:45.800
There was this nurse.

11:47.606 --> 11:49.699
- And-
- And what?

11:51.243 --> 11:53.177
And I'm really sorry, okay?

11:56.248 --> 11:58.614
I promise it'll never happen again.

12:00.119 --> 12:02.519
You know, that's exactly
what Michael used to say.

12:02.588 --> 12:05.148
- Come on, Jackie.
- No. You know what, Steven?

12:05.224 --> 12:07.658
I'm sorry.
It's over.

it's my old wedding dress.

12:42.601 --> 12:44.694
Oh, and you can wear it...

12:46.638 --> 12:48.868
as a bib.

12:50.943 --> 12:55.004
Hey, and for the reception, I got the guys
back together from my high school band-

12:55.080 --> 12:57.742
the Pinciotti Polka Explosion.

12:59.351 --> 13:03.913
Won't be long now until you
two lovebirds are married... forever.

13:03.989 --> 13:06.116
No escape.

13:06.191 --> 13:08.751
Until one of you is dead.

13:11.764 --> 13:16.633
So, you guys, I've been trying to
think of ways to help you.

13:16.702 --> 13:20.729
Okay.
Where's Laurie?

13:20.806 --> 13:22.865
Yeah, what happened to you?

13:22.941 --> 13:27.435
You guys, living in Chicago
opened my eyes.

13:27.513 --> 13:30.209
I had no job, no friends.

13:30.282 --> 13:32.216
I did sleep
with one of the White Sox...

13:32.284 --> 13:36.118
but then it just turned out to be
this frat guy wearing a White Sox hat.

13:40.959 --> 13:43.894
Basically, I hit rock bottom.

13:43.962 --> 13:47.591
Really. God, I was so sure
you'd be a senator.

13:47.666 --> 13:50.658
Eric, love is hard to find.

13:50.736 --> 13:54.968
And I've realized I've been taking
the people who love me for granted.

13:55.040 --> 13:56.974
Especially you.

13:57.042 --> 13:59.840
Oh, that's not true.

13:59.912 --> 14:01.880
I don't love you.

14:03.148 --> 14:05.241
Yes, you do.

14:05.317 --> 14:08.718
And if you two love each other,
but Red is making you miserable...

14:08.787 --> 14:10.812
then there's only one answer.

14:10.889 --> 14:14.052
Get out.
Leave town.

14:15.127 --> 14:17.789
Because love is precious.

14:19.765 --> 14:22.199
Well, it sounds good...

14:22.267 --> 14:24.792
but I can't help but remember
the feeling of being stung by bees...

14:24.870 --> 14:27.430
as I tumbled around and around.

14:30.709 --> 14:33.143
Wait.
Is that a tear?

14:33.212 --> 14:36.181
Oh, my God, Eric.
I think she's being sincere.

14:41.053 --> 14:43.851
Oh, my God, it's real.

14:45.824 --> 14:48.292
I have a sister.

14:55.667 --> 14:57.999
Hey, look who I found.

14:59.872 --> 15:01.806
At first I just thought
he was a leprechaun.

15:07.746 --> 15:12.911
Fez, I came over here because I wanna end
this feud, okay? Right here, right now.

15:12.985 --> 15:16.148
And if you're not on board,
I could spread your crazy...

15:16.221 --> 15:19.281
naked, homoerotic dream
all over school, but-

15:21.260 --> 15:24.058
Macho as I am...

15:24.129 --> 15:26.757
who would believe you?

15:26.832 --> 15:29.733
Okay, Fez.

15:29.801 --> 15:34.761
Uh, can I just say as the nurse
that was sponging you in your dream...

15:34.840 --> 15:39.504
that I'm with Mitch here on the whole
"not spreading it around the school" thing.

15:39.578 --> 15:43.514
See, your lady friend here
understands.

15:46.084 --> 15:47.813
Truce?

15:47.886 --> 15:49.820
Well...

15:51.123 --> 15:53.057
I guess.

15:53.125 --> 15:56.458
- Truce.
- Good. Here. Peace offering. Moron!

16:04.970 --> 16:08.167
Oh, this is tomorrow's school paper.

16:08.240 --> 16:10.174
Oh, my God, on the front page...

16:10.242 --> 16:12.506
there's a picture of me
kissing Kelso by the lake.

16:16.181 --> 16:18.342
Fez, why are you kissing
Kelso by the lake?

16:18.417 --> 16:20.977
We caught a fish!

16:22.654 --> 16:25.418
I was excited!

16:25.490 --> 16:28.516
I kissed the fish too, but, of course,
they don't show you that.

16:32.197 --> 16:36.099
Jackie. Jackie.
It's Hyde.

16:36.168 --> 16:37.567
- No.
- Yes.

16:37.636 --> 16:39.035
- No.
- Yes.

16:39.104 --> 16:41.766
[Sighs]
Fine.

16:46.278 --> 16:48.371
Can I say something?

16:48.447 --> 16:51.814
I think this whole thing
was a misunderstanding.

16:51.883 --> 16:54.351
Hyde didn't know what was going on.

16:54.419 --> 16:57.013
I know, okay?
But after Michael...

16:57.089 --> 17:01.048
I promised myself that I would never be
with another boy who cheated on me.

17:03.061 --> 17:05.723
But Hyde's so good for you.
Since you started dating him...

17:05.797 --> 17:08.265
you've completely stopped
quoting Nancy Drew.

17:09.601 --> 17:11.898
And the worst part is
I still love him.

17:12.971 --> 17:15.234
I know.

17:15.307 --> 17:17.241
[Clicks Tongue, Sobs]

17:19.077 --> 17:21.602
You know, normally,
I wouldn't cry on your sweater...

17:21.680 --> 17:24.079
because, you know,
it ruins the fabric.

17:24.148 --> 17:26.481
But, God, this one's just so cheap,
it won't matter.

17:33.525 --> 17:36.585
- What?
- Nothing.

17:36.662 --> 17:40.223
- Just, you know, Jackie's single now.
- ## [Stereo: Country]

17:40.299 --> 17:42.426
Yeah, so?

17:42.501 --> 17:45.299
So, when you were
going out with her, I backed off.

17:45.370 --> 17:47.361
You backed off?

17:47.439 --> 17:49.805
You constantly hit on her.
You bought her presents all the time.

17:49.875 --> 17:52.901
You shot me with a BB gun.

17:52.978 --> 17:55.344
Yeah, that's me backin' off.

17:58.283 --> 18:00.217
[Sighs]
Look, Hyde.

18:00.285 --> 18:04.517
I know you thought I only wanted her
because you had her.

18:04.589 --> 18:08.753
See, the thing is,
is now you don't have her...

18:08.827 --> 18:11.455
and I still want her.

18:11.530 --> 18:16.991
So, as your friend, I'm just letting you know
that I'm going after her.

18:17.069 --> 18:19.537
And also, I'll be making out
with her in front of you.

18:21.573 --> 18:23.768
You know, just to rub it in.

18:24.776 --> 18:26.835
So, be ready for that.

18:31.083 --> 18:33.449
Whatever.

18:33.518 --> 18:37.352
Yep, that's what I'm countin' on.

18:37.422 --> 18:41.222
While I'm out getting Jackie back, you're
gonna sit around here saying, "Whatever."

18:41.293 --> 18:43.784
## [Continues]

18:46.998 --> 18:49.831
Are you listening
to country music, man?

18:49.901 --> 18:51.994
Whatever.

18:53.572 --> 18:57.064
Look, Mom, Dad, Donna and I
have something we wanna say.

18:57.142 --> 19:01.442
Um, it turns out we're
not ready to get married.

19:01.513 --> 19:03.447
No!

19:05.717 --> 19:10.586
And I was really rootin'
for you two crazy kids.

19:10.655 --> 19:13.556
Look, we know you've been
pressuring us into marriage...

19:13.625 --> 19:16.560
so we'd admit you were right
and live on your terms.

19:16.628 --> 19:19.927
But that's just not gonna happen.

19:19.998 --> 19:24.992
So, we've decided to move away
as soon as we graduate.

19:25.070 --> 19:27.265
Move away?

19:27.339 --> 19:29.569
No, no, no, you can't move away yet.

19:31.877 --> 19:34.846
No, we were gonna use this summer
to become best friends.

19:36.214 --> 19:39.183
Look, we'll be going
to college in the fall anyway.

19:39.251 --> 19:41.481
Instead of fighting with you guys
for the next three months...

19:41.553 --> 19:43.487
we're just gonna get
our own place in Madison.

19:43.555 --> 19:46.752
Yeah, good luck trying to
control us in Madison.

19:51.363 --> 19:54.230
Hey, Donna, remember we agreed
not to do that.

19:54.299 --> 19:57.666
Remember?
Okay.

19:57.736 --> 19:59.727
Anyway, we're gonna have
our own apartment.

19:59.805 --> 20:03.901
And, honestly, I just think
we'll all be a lot happier.

20:03.975 --> 20:08.275
- Madison has two movie theaters.
- Okay, Donna, come on.

20:11.216 --> 20:13.980
Oh, great plan, Red.

20:14.052 --> 20:16.646
Now my baby's leaving.

20:16.721 --> 20:19.383
I'm still here, Mommy.

20:20.459 --> 20:22.450
Yeah, well, that's nice.

20:26.798 --> 20:29.164
- Hey.
<i>- [Door Closes]</i>

20:35.574 --> 20:37.769
The thing is, is I'm really sorry.

20:38.910 --> 20:41.003
- Yeah, you said that already.
<i>- [Page Turns]</i>

20:41.079 --> 20:44.515
Come on, Jackie.
I made a mistake, okay?

20:44.583 --> 20:47.074
It was a stupid one-time thing.

20:47.152 --> 20:49.712
You know what, Steven?
I have heard it all before.

20:49.788 --> 20:52.655
From you, from Michael.

20:52.724 --> 20:54.885
God, just do me a favor
and leave me alone.

20:56.261 --> 20:58.627
Whatever.

21:03.602 --> 21:05.536
Jackie.

21:06.938 --> 21:08.872
I love you.

21:13.578 --> 21:15.512
Yeah, well, I don't love you.

21:25.490 --> 21:28.823
Here's your car license,
motorcycle license...

21:28.894 --> 21:33.422
boat license,
license to operate a forklift...

21:33.498 --> 21:38.333
a cut-the-line pass
and a free D.M.V. Pen.

21:38.403 --> 21:41.497
If you turn it over,
the little car parallel parks.

21:41.573 --> 21:45.737
Oh. And here's the negatives of you
and Kelso grabbing each other's asses.

21:45.810 --> 21:47.744
Hey, we were happy
because we caught a fish.

21:47.812 --> 21:49.677
If they do it in football,
why can't we do it in fishing?

21:49.748 --> 21:52.717
"Blue bit bushball in bishing"?
What? Where you from, man?
