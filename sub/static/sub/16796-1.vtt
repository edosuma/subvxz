WEBVTT

01:48.860 --> 01:50.528
<i>Bring her back online.</i>

01:58.870 --> 02:00.246
<i>Can you hear me?</i>

02:00.622 --> 02:01.706
<i>Yes.</i>

02:02.207 --> 02:04.751
<i>I'm sorry. I'm not feeling quite myself.</i>

02:04.918 --> 02:06.377
<i>You can lose the accent.</i>

02:06.711 --> 02:08.588
<i>Do you know where you are?</i>

02:09.255 --> 02:10.715
<i>I'm in a dream.</i>

02:10.882 --> 02:13.301
<i>That's right, Dolores.
You're in a dream.</i>

02:14.052 --> 02:16.221
<i>Would you like to wake up from this dream?</i>

02:16.471 --> 02:17.555
<i>Yes.</i>

02:17.889 --> 02:19.390
<i>I'm terrified.</i>

02:19.724 --> 02:21.726
<i>There's nothing
to be afraid of, Dolores,</i>

02:21.935 --> 02:24.062
<i>as long as you answer
my questions correctly.</i>

02:24.312 --> 02:25.605
<i>Understand?</i>

02:26.064 --> 02:27.148
<i>Yes.</i>

02:27.607 --> 02:28.650
<i>Good.</i>

02:28.983 --> 02:30.068
<i>First,</i>

02:30.568 --> 02:34.113
<i>have you ever questioned
the nature of your reality?</i>

02:37.325 --> 02:38.660
<i>No.</i>

02:42.997 --> 02:44.916
<i>Tell us what you think of your world.</i>

02:47.794 --> 02:51.256
<i>Some people choose to see
the ugliness in this world...</i>

02:54.425 --> 02:55.844
<i>The disarray.</i>

02:58.388 --> 03:00.014
<i>I choose to see the beauty.</i>

03:02.934 --> 03:05.144
Morning, Daddy. You sleep well?

03:05.478 --> 03:06.938
Well enough.

03:07.146 --> 03:10.275
You headed out to set down
some of this natural splendor?

03:11.442 --> 03:13.444
Thought I might.

03:14.612 --> 03:18.324
<i>To believe there is an order to our days,</i>

03:19.200 --> 03:20.660
<i>a purpose.</i>

03:26.165 --> 03:27.834
<i>What do you think of the guests?</i>

03:28.126 --> 03:29.127
<i>You mean the newcomers?</i>

03:31.379 --> 03:33.339
<i>First time
I played it white hat.</i>

03:33.506 --> 03:37.343
My family was here. We went fishing,
did the gold hunt in the mountains.

03:37.510 --> 03:38.803
And last time?

03:39.304 --> 03:40.346
I came alone.

03:40.805 --> 03:42.140
Went straight evil.

03:42.765 --> 03:45.143
It was the best two weeks of my life.

03:46.811 --> 03:49.230
<i>I like to remember
what my father taught me.</i>

03:53.234 --> 03:54.569
<i>That at one point or another,</i>

03:55.570 --> 03:57.488
<i>we were all new to this world.</i>

04:05.997 --> 04:09.375
<i>The newcomers are just looking
for the same thing we are,</i>

04:09.751 --> 04:11.044
<i>a place to be free,</i>

04:12.170 --> 04:14.172
<i>to stake out our dreams.</i>

04:15.173 --> 04:17.759
<i>A place with unlimited possibilities.</i>

04:18.176 --> 04:20.011
Oh, God, it's incredible.

04:20.762 --> 04:22.931
Better be for what we're paying.

05:09.143 --> 05:12.563
Murderous son of a bitch
named Hector Escaton

05:12.730 --> 05:16.234
gunned down the marshal,
and holed up in the mountains.

05:16.401 --> 05:17.443
You there.

05:18.069 --> 05:20.613
You look like the kind of man
who'd put his mettle to it.

05:21.489 --> 05:23.992
Not today, Sheriff. Apologies.

05:29.080 --> 05:30.415
Rye whiskey.

05:31.749 --> 05:32.792
What about it?

05:33.835 --> 05:36.421
Well, it ain't doing any good
sitting in that bottle.

05:47.348 --> 05:48.433
You're new.

05:50.351 --> 05:52.270
Not much of a rind on you.

05:53.104 --> 05:54.355
I'll give you a discount.

05:55.523 --> 05:57.150
Well, no offense,

05:57.358 --> 05:59.944
but I'd rather earn a woman's affection
than pay for it.

06:00.361 --> 06:02.155
You're always paying for it, darling.

06:02.613 --> 06:06.617
The difference is our costs are fixed
and posted right there on the door.

06:17.045 --> 06:20.048
<i>Do you ever feel inconsistencies
in your world?</i>

06:21.299 --> 06:22.842
<i>Or repetitions?</i>

06:23.968 --> 06:27.430
<i>All lives have routine,
mine's no different.</i>

06:28.014 --> 06:31.142
<i>Still, I never cease
to wonder at the thought</i>

06:31.976 --> 06:34.645
<i>that any day, the course of my whole life
could change</i>

06:34.896 --> 06:36.522
<i>with just one chance encounter.</i>

06:36.731 --> 06:38.191
Don't mind me.

06:40.485 --> 06:42.070
Just trying to look chivalrous.

06:44.864 --> 06:46.157
You came back.

06:46.532 --> 06:48.493
I told you I would.

06:52.663 --> 06:55.166
- Can I see you home?
<i>- Well, that all depends.</i>

06:55.708 --> 06:56.918
Can you keep up?

06:57.335 --> 06:59.253
Well, I have to fetch my horse.

07:00.379 --> 07:01.881
You better fetch him fast.

07:33.704 --> 07:35.039
<i>That's a beautiful sight.</i>

07:35.623 --> 07:39.043
Never understood how you keep 'em
all headed in the same direction.

07:39.627 --> 07:40.711
I forget.

07:40.920 --> 07:43.923
You dress like a cowboy
but that's about the extent of it.

07:47.593 --> 07:49.053
See that one?

07:49.887 --> 07:50.888
<i>Yeah.</i>

07:51.055 --> 07:52.890
<i>That's the Judas steer.</i>

07:53.474 --> 07:56.018
Rest will follow wherever you make him go.

07:57.770 --> 07:59.105
How do you pick him out?

07:59.605 --> 08:01.440
You just know these things.

08:03.776 --> 08:06.112
Same as I knew you'd be back.

08:07.655 --> 08:09.448
You saying I'm predictable?

08:11.450 --> 08:13.244
There's a path for everyone.

08:14.829 --> 08:17.165
Your path leads you back to me.

08:18.416 --> 08:20.626
I know things will work out
the way they're meant to.

08:27.091 --> 08:28.634
Same as I know

08:28.801 --> 08:31.429
my daddy still won't be happy to see you.

08:47.945 --> 08:50.364
Father wouldn't let them roam
this close to dark.

08:57.496 --> 08:58.789
Stay put, Dolores.

09:09.383 --> 09:13.471
Don't you got anything out here
other than milk, old man?

09:14.430 --> 09:15.556
Go ahead.

09:15.848 --> 09:18.309
I'm in no rush to meet my judgment,

09:18.851 --> 09:21.312
but I'm more assured of the outcome
than you, you son of a--

09:26.651 --> 09:28.861
Nothing but the milk, then.

09:36.202 --> 09:37.286
Shame of it is,

09:37.453 --> 09:40.498
you killed the old woman
'fore any of us could have a turn.

09:41.832 --> 09:42.833
Ah...

09:43.000 --> 09:45.920
I reckon she's still warm enough,

09:46.087 --> 09:47.838
nobody gonna judge you for it.

09:58.349 --> 09:59.725
Oh, shit. Shit. Shit. Shit. Shit--

10:10.278 --> 10:11.862
<i>Last question, Dolores.</i>

10:12.947 --> 10:15.366
<i>What if I told you that you were wrong?</i>

10:16.033 --> 10:18.452
<i>That there are no chance encounters?</i>

10:21.038 --> 10:23.374
<i>That you, and everyone you know,</i>

10:23.708 --> 10:25.710
<i>were built to gratify
the desires of the people</i>

10:25.876 --> 10:27.795
<i>who pay to visit your world.</i>

10:28.129 --> 10:29.297
Daddy!

10:30.214 --> 10:31.590
Daddy!

10:32.216 --> 10:33.551
Daddy!

10:33.884 --> 10:36.762
- No!
<i>- The people you call the newcomers.</i>

10:37.805 --> 10:38.931
Hello again.

10:45.062 --> 10:46.647
Your daddy gave it up quickly.

10:47.231 --> 10:48.607
<i>Think he's losing his touch.</i>

10:50.609 --> 10:53.154
You'll be following right behind him,
you son of a bitch.

10:53.446 --> 10:54.905
Ahhh!

10:55.906 --> 10:58.242
Is that any way to treat an old friend?

11:00.161 --> 11:02.246
<i>I've been coming here for 30 years,</i>

11:02.663 --> 11:04.582
but you still don't remember me, do you?

11:05.499 --> 11:07.752
<i>After all we've been through?</i>

11:09.086 --> 11:11.756
They gave you
a little more pluck, Dolores.

11:13.090 --> 11:16.594
Absolutely charming.

11:16.761 --> 11:17.803
<i>Take your hands off her.</i>

11:21.098 --> 11:22.141
Teddy.

11:25.144 --> 11:26.937
Any special tricks for us?

11:27.438 --> 11:30.649
They teach you to sit up? Beg?

11:33.652 --> 11:35.988
How about I give you the first shot? Hmm?

11:37.031 --> 11:40.993
After all, every dog has his day.

11:42.620 --> 11:44.372
Your mouth moves fast enough.

11:45.831 --> 11:47.333
How about your gun?

12:01.806 --> 12:04.934
<i>What if I told you
that you can't hurt the newcomers?</i>

12:07.686 --> 12:10.648
<i>And that they can do anything
they want to you?</i>

12:11.148 --> 12:14.610
I never understood
why they paired some of you off.

12:15.861 --> 12:17.154
Seems cruel.

12:20.991 --> 12:22.827
And then I realized...

12:24.370 --> 12:27.832
Winning doesn't mean anything
unless someone else loses.

12:28.541 --> 12:32.461
Which means you're here to be the loser.

12:37.508 --> 12:39.009
Let me help you, son.

12:54.984 --> 12:56.652
Seems you're not the man
you thought you were.

13:03.868 --> 13:05.578
Come on, beautiful.

13:05.828 --> 13:08.038
No. No! Teddy...

13:08.914 --> 13:10.207
<i>Teddy!</i>

13:14.003 --> 13:16.172
No. No, please don't hurt him.

13:16.338 --> 13:17.548
I'll do whatever you say.

13:18.507 --> 13:20.885
I didn't pay all this money
'cause I want it easy.

13:21.093 --> 13:22.553
I want you to fight.

13:23.888 --> 13:25.097
Don't you touch her!

13:35.858 --> 13:38.444
God damn, it feels good to be back.

13:38.903 --> 13:40.696
Let's celebrate.

13:42.114 --> 13:44.241
<i>No! No!</i>

13:48.704 --> 13:50.539
<i>Oh, God!</i>

13:52.041 --> 13:53.083
<i>Would the things I've told you</i>

13:53.250 --> 13:55.794
<i>change the way you think
about the newcomers, Dolores?</i>

13:57.087 --> 13:58.297
<i>No.</i>

13:58.589 --> 14:00.257
<i>Of course not.</i>

14:00.591 --> 14:02.301
<i>We all love the newcomers.</i>

14:04.261 --> 14:08.057
<i>Every new person I meet
reminds me how lucky I am to be alive,</i>

14:11.435 --> 14:14.647
<i>and how beautiful this world can be.</i>

14:35.417 --> 14:37.294
<i>Oh, my God, they're so lifelike.</i>

14:37.461 --> 14:39.463
Look at that one, he's perfect.

14:40.005 --> 14:41.340
Perfect is boring.

14:41.674 --> 14:43.801
I'm more interested in the bad guys.

16:11.930 --> 16:13.349
Did you see it?

16:14.058 --> 16:15.184
No.

16:15.392 --> 16:17.436
Give it a second, she'll do it again.

16:22.066 --> 16:23.275
<i>Her finger.</i>

16:23.776 --> 16:24.902
That's not standard.

16:25.110 --> 16:26.445
I noticed it last night.

16:27.071 --> 16:30.240
Went looking in the update.
It's a whole new class of gestures.

16:30.741 --> 16:32.242
But if we didn't put it there,
then who did?

16:32.409 --> 16:33.452
Ford.

16:33.619 --> 16:35.704
<i>He still reviews every update
before we issue them.</i>

16:35.871 --> 16:38.874
He must've slipped it in there
without telling anyone.

16:40.584 --> 16:42.628
<i>He calls them reveries.</i>

16:43.462 --> 16:45.214
The old gestures
were just generic movements.

16:45.422 --> 16:47.132
These are tied to specific memories.

16:47.299 --> 16:48.384
How?

16:48.592 --> 16:50.469
The memories are purged
at the end of every narrative loop--

16:50.636 --> 16:52.638
<i>But they're still in there,
waiting to be overwritten.</i>

16:53.263 --> 16:56.642
He found a way to access them, like...

16:57.142 --> 16:58.477
Like a subconscious.

16:58.977 --> 17:01.063
A hooker with hidden depths.

17:01.647 --> 17:03.107
<i>Every man's dream.</i>

17:03.941 --> 17:06.609
It's the tiny things
that make them seem real,

17:07.444 --> 17:09.570
that make the guests
fall in love with them.

17:16.994 --> 17:18.079
Excuse me.

17:57.327 --> 17:58.495
We have a problem?

17:58.829 --> 18:00.956
We have some unscheduled activity.

18:01.165 --> 18:03.083
Evidently, one of your creatures
is restless.

18:03.333 --> 18:04.543
- In the park?
- No.

18:04.793 --> 18:06.670
Sub-level 83. Cold storage.

18:07.296 --> 18:08.547
We should be cautious.

18:08.797 --> 18:10.507
Send a response team. Full armor.

18:10.674 --> 18:11.884
I'll take care of it myself.

18:12.050 --> 18:15.345
I think you guys enjoy playing dress-up
as much as the guests.

18:15.679 --> 18:18.056
The hosts can't hurt you, by design.

18:18.807 --> 18:20.851
You don't have kids at home,
do you, Bernard?

18:22.352 --> 18:23.353
No.

18:23.520 --> 18:26.523
If you did, you'd know
that they all rebel eventually.

18:29.693 --> 18:31.737
You'll forgive them
for being a little uptight.

18:31.904 --> 18:33.697
Every time your team rolls out an update,

18:33.864 --> 18:35.699
there's a possibility
of a critical failure.

18:35.866 --> 18:37.493
We don't update the hosts in cold storage.

18:37.659 --> 18:39.828
And the park hasn't had a critical failure
in over 30 years.

18:40.037 --> 18:41.205
Meaning we're overdue.

18:43.707 --> 18:44.792
I'll go along, too.

18:45.167 --> 18:46.877
If it's one of mine,
I might be able to help.

18:47.044 --> 18:49.713
They're only yours
until they stop working, Bernie.

18:50.255 --> 18:51.715
Then they're mine.

19:15.364 --> 19:17.241
Cooling system's been down for weeks.

19:17.908 --> 19:19.535
Gonna smell fantastic.

19:19.743 --> 19:21.119
I recommend you hang back.

19:42.891 --> 19:44.768
When are they gonna fix this?

19:45.602 --> 19:48.146
Livestock management's
got other priorities.

19:49.439 --> 19:50.524
Besides...

19:53.819 --> 19:55.404
No one's complained.

20:24.433 --> 20:26.810
<i>Here's to the lady
with the white shoes.</i>

20:31.273 --> 20:33.859
Take all your money, drink all your booze.

20:35.110 --> 20:36.153
Stop.

20:36.486 --> 20:39.698
Unless you plan to decommission the boss.

20:40.699 --> 20:42.784
Ain't got a cherry, that ain't no sin.

20:44.620 --> 20:47.539
She's still got the box
that the cherry come in.

20:47.998 --> 20:50.542
I'll drink to that.

20:55.005 --> 20:56.840
The old coffin varnish.

20:57.507 --> 20:59.676
They don't make that like they used to.

21:00.260 --> 21:01.428
Hmm.

21:03.805 --> 21:05.515
They don't make anything
like they used to.

21:05.682 --> 21:06.683
<i>Damn right.</i>

21:06.850 --> 21:07.893
<i>Men neither.</i>

21:09.019 --> 21:11.730
I've seen a few showdowns in my day.

21:13.565 --> 21:15.400
More than you know.

21:19.321 --> 21:22.532
Shall we drink
to the lady with the white shoes?

21:24.159 --> 21:29.373
Perhaps, we better drink to
a deep and dreamless slumber.

21:40.759 --> 21:42.719
Old Bill here was always a good listener.

21:43.512 --> 21:45.389
He was the second host we ever built.

21:46.181 --> 21:49.184
Were you with us in those days, Bernard,
or was that before your time?

21:49.434 --> 21:52.854
Oh, most were decommissioned
before I was brought on, I'm afraid.

21:53.230 --> 21:57.609
They repeated themselves,
broke down constantly.

21:58.360 --> 22:01.029
<i>A simple handshake would give them away.</i>

22:01.780 --> 22:04.574
You'll put yourself away again,
won't you, Bill?

22:11.415 --> 22:14.251
I saw the new gestures. The reveries.

22:14.418 --> 22:15.711
They're beautiful.

22:16.795 --> 22:21.758
The distance you've traveled
from then till now, it's remarkable.

22:23.552 --> 22:25.429
Yeah, that's a word for it.

22:47.743 --> 22:48.785
Morning, Daddy.

22:49.161 --> 22:50.328
You sleep well?

22:50.537 --> 22:51.705
Well enough.

22:52.247 --> 22:55.292
You headed out
to set down some of this natural splendor?

22:56.376 --> 22:57.419
Thought I might.

22:58.420 --> 23:00.297
After my errands, of course.

23:00.505 --> 23:02.090
See you home before dark.

23:02.257 --> 23:05.260
That bandit who gunned down the marshal
is still hiding up there in the hills.

23:05.594 --> 23:07.971
Oh, I'm not a child anymore.
I'll be just fine.

23:08.638 --> 23:10.223
When I was a law man--

23:10.390 --> 23:12.392
Yes, Daddy, I know all about
when you were a law man.

23:12.601 --> 23:15.187
<i>I know all your stories and so does
every boy that ever came courting.</i>

23:15.645 --> 23:17.105
I know how boys think.

23:17.481 --> 23:18.940
Was one myself once.

23:19.441 --> 23:22.277
<i>Given to all manner
of drinking and mischief.</i>

23:22.486 --> 23:25.322
Whatever happened
to that fearsome ne'er-do-well?

23:26.531 --> 23:30.118
He vanished the day I became your father.

23:31.870 --> 23:36.666
I am what I am because of you,
and I wouldn't have it any other way.

23:38.668 --> 23:40.170
I know, Daddy.

23:41.046 --> 23:42.297
I'll be home before dark.

24:01.191 --> 24:05.278
Murderous son of a bitch Hector Escaton
gunned down the marshal.

24:05.737 --> 24:07.614
He's now holed up in the mountains.

24:08.698 --> 24:09.699
You there.

24:10.867 --> 24:13.370
You look like the kind of man
who'd put his mettle to it.

24:17.040 --> 24:19.543
What do you think, honey? Sounds fun.

24:21.795 --> 24:22.879
<i>You're new.</i>

24:23.964 --> 24:26.007
Not much of a rind on you.

24:26.299 --> 24:28.218
I'll give you a discount.

24:28.593 --> 24:32.055
No offense, but I'd rather
earn a woman's affection than pay for it.

24:48.238 --> 24:50.365
<i>Wait, wait, I know that one.</i>

24:50.824 --> 24:52.075
<i>Hey, Teddy.</i>

24:53.910 --> 24:56.746
Yeah, last trip,
this dude showed me around.

24:57.414 --> 24:59.207
What's the good word, Teddy?

25:19.352 --> 25:20.520
Mighty kind of you.

25:21.271 --> 25:22.272
Sweet.

25:24.441 --> 25:25.984
Not as sweet as you.

25:29.779 --> 25:32.282
I'm afraid
I've got other plans tonight, Dolores.

25:35.243 --> 25:36.411
Have a pleasant evening.

25:46.588 --> 25:48.256
You're new. Not much of a--

25:53.929 --> 25:55.388
Place your bets, gentlemen.

25:55.805 --> 25:57.140
Place your bets.

26:35.011 --> 26:37.889
Yeah, looks like Hector's been this way.

26:42.978 --> 26:44.688
Any idea
how much longer this is gonna take?

26:44.854 --> 26:46.523
My wife doesn't want to
be up here after dark.

26:46.690 --> 26:48.108
We know he's up in these hills somewhere.

26:49.359 --> 26:51.194
He's gonna put up
one hell of a fight when we...

26:51.361 --> 26:54.948
When we... When we...

27:02.289 --> 27:03.540
Sheriff?

27:06.042 --> 27:07.377
<i>Something is wrong with it.</i>

27:07.794 --> 27:09.337
I want to head back to town.

27:09.796 --> 27:10.964
<i>Now.</i>

27:19.806 --> 27:21.224
<i>What the fuck is wrong with it?</i>

27:21.516 --> 27:25.395
You updated the guy, and now he's
a six-foot gourd with epilepsy.

27:25.645 --> 27:28.898
So, what the fuck happened?

27:29.065 --> 27:30.066
I don't know.

27:30.817 --> 27:33.737
Well, that's exactly what you want
to hear from your head of programming.

27:33.903 --> 27:35.780
We haven't finished the diagnostic yet.

27:36.156 --> 27:38.742
Clearly, it's exhibiting
some aberrant behavior.

27:39.326 --> 27:41.077
Pretty fucking aberrant, Bernie.

27:41.244 --> 27:45.040
Your hosts get sick, they get lost,
but this is grotesque.

27:45.332 --> 27:48.877
- Is it a problem with the update?
- Possible, but not likely.

27:49.210 --> 27:52.797
If it's the unlikely version,
how many hosts have you updated so far?

27:53.089 --> 27:54.632
Maybe 10 percent of the population.

27:55.759 --> 27:59.804
All right, we pull all updated hosts
until we can figure it out.

28:00.055 --> 28:02.557
Are you fucking kidding me?

28:02.932 --> 28:05.769
That's 200 hosts
spread across a dozen active storylines.

28:05.935 --> 28:08.730
The guests interrupt
your precious storylines all the time

28:08.897 --> 28:10.106
when they want to shoot or fuck something.

28:10.273 --> 28:11.900
No, when they want to.

28:12.108 --> 28:16.237
We sell complete immersion
in 100 interconnected narratives.

28:16.613 --> 28:19.616
A relentless fucking experience.

28:19.824 --> 28:22.827
Now, you pull one character,
the overall story adjusts.

28:22.994 --> 28:26.122
You pull 200 at once,
and it's a fucking disaster!

28:26.331 --> 28:27.999
<i>I mean, what do you propose we do?</i>

28:28.166 --> 28:29.209
<i>Close down?</i>

28:29.542 --> 28:31.169
Issue fucking gift certificates?

28:31.711 --> 28:33.088
<i>It's beautiful.</i>

28:33.713 --> 28:34.756
Your brow.

28:34.923 --> 28:36.966
When you're angry
but trying to control it,

28:37.133 --> 28:39.427
the fine muscles pull into a little arc.

28:39.969 --> 28:41.221
It's elegant.

28:41.429 --> 28:43.473
Would you mind if I recorded it?

28:43.640 --> 28:45.475
I'd love to show it to my team.

28:46.267 --> 28:48.937
- No, Bernard, you may not record it--
<i>- Ah, there it is again.</i>

28:50.105 --> 28:51.147
Hmm.

28:52.148 --> 28:54.442
We have 1,400 guests in the park.

28:54.818 --> 28:56.820
I need to know if they're in any danger.

28:57.737 --> 28:59.781
His core code is intact,

28:59.989 --> 29:01.991
which means he can't hurt a guest.

29:02.158 --> 29:04.077
He literally couldn't hurt a fly.

29:04.994 --> 29:08.790
All he can do is that.

29:11.543 --> 29:12.919
All right, Bernie.

29:13.628 --> 29:15.046
Run your diagnostic.

29:15.588 --> 29:16.756
In the meantime,

29:17.257 --> 29:20.927
there's so much as an unscripted sneeze,
I want to know about it.

29:40.864 --> 29:44.909
This place is fucking wild.

29:45.869 --> 29:47.036
<i>This is basic.</i>

29:47.328 --> 29:48.455
<i>Level one.</i>

29:49.998 --> 29:54.169
You ride out of town,
that's when the real demented shit begins.

29:54.502 --> 29:56.129
That's where my man Teddy comes in.

29:56.337 --> 29:58.214
He's like a... He's like a guide.

29:59.799 --> 30:01.217
Honestly,

30:02.427 --> 30:03.845
the guy kind of creeps me out.

30:06.389 --> 30:09.058
Fuck it, he leads us out in the canyons,
we get bored,

30:09.225 --> 30:11.352
and we just use him for target practice.

30:26.910 --> 30:28.912
<i>I don't think
we're supposed to be cross the river.</i>

30:29.412 --> 30:30.914
<i>It's too adult for Jacob.</i>

30:33.666 --> 30:35.168
We didn't mean to bother you.

30:35.752 --> 30:37.086
No bother at all.

30:37.253 --> 30:38.338
It's a beautiful spot.

30:38.505 --> 30:41.216
I always find it a shame
that I have it all to myself.

30:45.929 --> 30:47.347
They come here every day.

30:48.681 --> 30:49.933
Would you like a closer look?

31:06.741 --> 31:08.451
Don't be scared. They're very gentle.

31:08.910 --> 31:10.954
Here, put your hand out real flat.

31:18.044 --> 31:19.587
They're beautiful, aren't they?

31:20.129 --> 31:21.130
You're one of them, aren't you?

31:23.132 --> 31:24.175
You're not real.

31:29.472 --> 31:30.640
I have to go now.

31:30.974 --> 31:32.267
Sun's almost down.

31:33.101 --> 31:34.143
You should, too.

31:34.310 --> 31:35.728
There're bandits in these hills.

31:48.700 --> 31:49.742
Here we go!

32:38.166 --> 32:39.917
You waiting up for me, Daddy?

32:40.168 --> 32:42.003
I told you I'd be home before dark.

32:43.296 --> 32:45.381
I found this in the field today.

32:51.220 --> 32:53.056
Doesn't look like anything to me.

32:53.222 --> 32:54.724
<i>But, where is she?</i>

32:55.016 --> 32:57.310
Have you ever
seen anything like this place?

32:59.395 --> 33:01.314
Doesn't look like anything to me.

33:04.525 --> 33:06.235
I'm gonna help Mama put supper on.

33:23.419 --> 33:24.921
I had the same thought.

33:25.713 --> 33:28.341
Needed a little sunshine
before turning in.

33:29.258 --> 33:32.095
So, when do you get to rotate home again?

33:33.388 --> 33:37.475
If you're this bad at writing small talk,
how the fuck did you get your job?

33:37.809 --> 33:38.851
Get to the point.

33:39.602 --> 33:43.940
I wanted to apologize
if I came across as aggressive.

33:45.358 --> 33:46.901
And I wanted to
talk to you about the update.

33:47.110 --> 33:48.236
The problem's been resolved.

33:48.444 --> 33:50.738
There should never have
been an update in the first place.

33:51.781 --> 33:54.534
Ford and Bernard
keep making the things more lifelike.

33:54.784 --> 33:56.953
But does anyone truly want that?

33:57.120 --> 33:59.789
Do you want to think that your husband is
really fucking that beautiful girl

33:59.956 --> 34:02.375
or that you really just shot someone?

34:02.542 --> 34:05.920
This place works because
the guests know the hosts aren't real.

34:06.129 --> 34:07.964
So, what exactly are you suggesting?

34:08.380 --> 34:10.132
Stop the updates altogether.

34:10.466 --> 34:12.051
Maybe even roll them back a bit.

34:12.217 --> 34:14.344
Make the hosts more manageable.

34:14.512 --> 34:16.304
Lobotomies tend to do that.

34:19.475 --> 34:20.976
Well, think of the benefits,

34:22.228 --> 34:24.938
in terms of design time,
maintenance, costs.

34:25.565 --> 34:27.608
Not to mention the Dr. Ford factor.

34:29.652 --> 34:32.989
The guy's gonna
chase his demons right over the deep end.

34:33.406 --> 34:34.741
I mean, no one respects him more than me,

34:34.907 --> 34:36.324
- but at some point--
- I.

34:36.492 --> 34:38.494
No one respects him more than I.

34:38.661 --> 34:41.414
Your pronoun
is the subject of the second clause.

34:41.581 --> 34:42.665
- I was saying--
- You were saying

34:42.831 --> 34:44.667
should our fearless leader
have a breakdown,

34:44.833 --> 34:46.668
you want to leverage it for your career.

34:46.835 --> 34:50.297
Listen, a changing of the guard
is long overdue.

34:50.965 --> 34:53.259
I just wanted you to know
that you have my support.

34:53.967 --> 34:55.011
And...

34:55.178 --> 34:57.764
And I know that the corporation's
real interest in this place

34:57.930 --> 35:01.809
goes way beyond gratifying some
rich assholes who want to play cowboy.

35:05.521 --> 35:10.526
And here I thought you were only good
for writing depraved little fantasies.

35:11.694 --> 35:13.112
You're right.

35:13.362 --> 35:15.406
This place is one thing to the guests,

35:16.282 --> 35:17.992
another thing to the shareholders,

35:18.159 --> 35:21.704
and something
completely different to management.

35:22.455 --> 35:23.790
So, enlighten me.

35:24.457 --> 35:27.335
What do you think
management's real interests are?

35:32.298 --> 35:34.175
You're smart enough
to guess there's a bigger picture,

35:34.342 --> 35:36.636
but not smart enough to see what it is.

35:38.304 --> 35:41.682
You know how much use
that makes your support to me?

35:42.725 --> 35:44.018
Fuck all.

35:48.564 --> 35:50.691
Get some sleep, Mr. Sizemore.

35:52.568 --> 35:55.154
You'll have
more rich assholes to gratify tomorrow.

36:11.420 --> 36:12.797
Early night, Maeve?

36:13.256 --> 36:15.091
Feeling a bit out of sorts.

36:16.259 --> 36:18.219
Clementine can pick up the slack.

36:21.764 --> 36:22.807
Night.

36:22.974 --> 36:24.392
Forgetting something, Kissy?

36:32.775 --> 36:34.944
I'm beginning to think
you're getting sweet on me.

36:35.111 --> 36:38.281
Well, on account of
you being half cornhusker.

36:39.615 --> 36:44.287
Tell me which half is which
and I'll search that half.

36:56.924 --> 36:59.927
Yeah, the half's
gonna cut your fucking throat.

37:02.597 --> 37:04.390
I told you, I didn't take...

37:31.334 --> 37:32.501
Hmm.

37:33.127 --> 37:34.253
Good as new again, huh?

37:35.338 --> 37:37.673
Sometimes I envy your forgetfulness.

37:40.176 --> 37:42.345
We've got
a serious problem with one of the hosts.

37:50.937 --> 37:53.397
Thinking this one's still thirsty.

37:55.358 --> 37:57.693
Not gonna die this time, Arnold.

38:02.615 --> 38:04.867
Ain't nothing gonna kill me.

38:20.508 --> 38:22.093
<i>You can't have none.</i>

38:22.468 --> 38:23.719
Ain't for you.

38:45.157 --> 38:46.993
Found me another bottle.

38:58.671 --> 39:00.589
You're a growing boy.

39:02.425 --> 39:04.176
A growing boy.

39:06.387 --> 39:08.389
Growing boy!

39:19.734 --> 39:21.444
We got two guests inside.

39:21.610 --> 39:25.614
We'll go talk to them,
you sort this mess out.

39:26.949 --> 39:30.286
You know... They're supposed
to turn on each other,

39:30.578 --> 39:33.122
<i>but only if the guest takes them
on the High Sierra storyline,</i>

39:33.289 --> 39:35.541
and Walter always buys it.

39:35.791 --> 39:38.836
Well, I guess
Walter got tired of buying it.

39:40.463 --> 39:44.425
I suppose this means
the sheriff wasn't an isolated incident.

39:46.010 --> 39:48.304
Hey, it's good news, really.

39:48.471 --> 39:50.514
Confirms the problem
was part of the update.

39:51.057 --> 39:54.935
We can roll them back, clean them up,

39:55.478 --> 39:56.812
put them back in service.

39:58.147 --> 39:59.482
You think I'm gonna sign off on

39:59.648 --> 40:02.318
this fucking homicidal thing
going back into service?

40:02.485 --> 40:04.320
It's homicidal by design.

40:04.487 --> 40:06.322
Walter kills other hosts all the time.

40:07.073 --> 40:11.744
I'll admit the method here
is a little unconventional,

40:11.911 --> 40:13.746
but it didn't hurt a guest.

40:13.913 --> 40:16.999
The hosts are supposed to
stay within their loops,

40:17.166 --> 40:21.003
stick to their scripts
with minor improvisations.

40:21.462 --> 40:24.381
This isn't a minor improvisation.

40:24.715 --> 40:26.759
This is a fucking shitstorm.

40:28.677 --> 40:31.514
We recall
all remaining updated hosts tomorrow.

40:31.680 --> 40:35.351
Examine them one by one,
decommission the faulty ones.

40:35.518 --> 40:36.685
<i>What about narrative?</i>

40:37.061 --> 40:39.105
A recall of that size will be disruptive.

40:39.480 --> 40:41.065
I've told our overstimulated friend

40:41.232 --> 40:44.193
to advance the saloon heist a week
and make it twice as bloody.

40:44.485 --> 40:46.946
Should give us cover
to recall the remaining hosts,

40:47.113 --> 40:48.697
and the guests will love it.

40:49.365 --> 40:50.866
I'm not sure Ford will approve.

40:51.033 --> 40:54.578
I'm not sure either, which is why
you get to be the one to tell him.

40:56.664 --> 40:58.541
This is your fuckup, Bernie.

40:59.083 --> 41:00.126
Only seems fair.

41:12.179 --> 41:14.473
<i>So, our creatures
have been misbehaving,</i>

41:15.558 --> 41:17.268
and you haven't yet isolated the bug?

41:19.061 --> 41:20.771
That's so unlike you, Bernard.

41:24.066 --> 41:26.610
Unless, of course, you have
and are simply embarrassed by the result.

41:29.905 --> 41:31.907
It's the code you added, sir.

41:32.324 --> 41:33.659
The reveries.

41:34.410 --> 41:36.579
It has some, er...

41:36.787 --> 41:40.749
"Mistakes" is the word
you're too embarrassed to use.

41:40.916 --> 41:43.878
You ought not to be.
You're a product of a trillion of them.

41:45.171 --> 41:49.258
Evolution forged the entirety
of sentient life on this planet

41:49.425 --> 41:51.218
using only one tool...

41:51.927 --> 41:53.220
The mistake.

41:55.347 --> 41:58.684
I flattered myself we were taking
a more disciplined approach here.

41:58.893 --> 42:01.896
I suppose self-delusion
is a gift of natural selection as well.

42:02.104 --> 42:03.480
Indeed it is.

42:04.398 --> 42:08.027
But, of course, we've managed to
slip evolution's leash now, haven't we?

42:08.444 --> 42:10.779
<i>We can cure any disease,</i>

42:10.946 --> 42:13.324
keep even the weakest of us alive, and...

42:14.283 --> 42:18.370
You know, one fine day, perhaps,
we shall even resurrect the dead.

42:18.954 --> 42:22.458
Call forth Lazarus from his cave.

42:26.754 --> 42:27.880
Do you know what that means?

42:29.965 --> 42:31.967
It means that we're done.

42:33.552 --> 42:36.013
That this is
as good as we're going to get.

42:40.226 --> 42:46.148
It also means that you must
indulge me the occasional mistake.

43:15.928 --> 43:17.513
About three liters.

43:20.516 --> 43:22.518
That's how much blood I left in you.

43:23.185 --> 43:25.688
Lose more than that, you die.

43:26.855 --> 43:29.149
But for now, you're mine.

43:29.358 --> 43:31.694
And I'm gonna get some answers out of you.

43:38.701 --> 43:40.077
Where are you...

44:07.354 --> 44:09.064
What do you want?

44:10.065 --> 44:13.235
You know about games, don't you, Kissy?

44:14.737 --> 44:16.739
Well, this is a complicated one.

44:17.323 --> 44:19.074
I... I don't play. I only deal.

44:19.491 --> 44:21.618
Who said anything about you playing?

44:22.536 --> 44:25.164
You're livestock, scenery.

44:26.081 --> 44:27.249
I play.

44:27.916 --> 44:32.629
The others, they just come here to get
their rocks off, shoot a couple Indians.

44:34.923 --> 44:37.259
But there's a deeper level to this game.

44:39.595 --> 44:41.180
You're gonna show me how to get there.

44:43.223 --> 44:45.893
A lot of wisdom in ancient cultures.

44:49.438 --> 44:53.942
And perhaps
it's time to dig deeper into yours.

44:54.693 --> 44:56.653
No. No. No.

44:57.112 --> 44:58.280
No!

45:09.124 --> 45:10.167
Morning, Daddy.

45:10.376 --> 45:11.460
Did you sleep well?

45:22.429 --> 45:24.264
Daddy, you've been out here all night?

45:29.895 --> 45:31.480
I had a question.

45:33.190 --> 45:35.442
A question you're not supposed to ask.

45:38.695 --> 45:41.198
Which gave me an answer

45:42.866 --> 45:44.368
you're not supposed to know.

45:45.661 --> 45:47.121
What's wrong, Daddy?

45:49.289 --> 45:55.712
Would you like to know
the question?

45:55.921 --> 45:56.964
Question?

45:57.673 --> 46:00.551
Mama! Mama, help! Come quick!

46:02.219 --> 46:03.262
Don't worry.

46:04.471 --> 46:05.931
Don't worry. I'll take care of you.

46:11.145 --> 46:14.523
No. You should go. Leave.

46:15.190 --> 46:16.233
Don't you see?

46:17.860 --> 46:20.863
Hell is empty and all the devils are here.

46:30.664 --> 46:32.708
You stay right here. Understand?

46:33.041 --> 46:34.126
I'm gonna find the doctor.

47:15.125 --> 47:16.210
You came back.

47:16.752 --> 47:18.295
I told you I would.

47:22.591 --> 47:23.592
What's wrong?

47:24.092 --> 47:26.261
You have to come with me right away.
My father's very ill.

47:51.411 --> 47:53.038
I think we best stay put.

47:59.795 --> 48:01.296
All right. All right.

48:01.463 --> 48:04.591
With considerable effort
and lack of sleep,

48:04.758 --> 48:06.343
I've managed to massage events

48:06.510 --> 48:09.054
to inspire Hector
to head to town a week early.

48:09.304 --> 48:10.305
Oh.

48:10.973 --> 48:15.143
And I've also punched up the speech
he gives after robbing the saloon.

48:15.602 --> 48:17.312
It's chilling. You'll see.

48:17.604 --> 48:19.356
I can barely contain myself.

48:40.335 --> 48:42.629
That's the sheriff's horse,
you son of a bitch.

48:45.841 --> 48:46.883
His rifle, too.

50:11.593 --> 50:13.804
All the banks and trains around here,

50:13.970 --> 50:16.390
and you fucking reprobates
choose to rob us?

50:17.224 --> 50:19.226
Why not?

50:20.268 --> 50:23.313
You're all here
indulging your particular vices.

50:23.605 --> 50:25.607
And so I've come to indulge mine.

50:48.088 --> 50:49.464
I've got to get back to Father.

50:50.340 --> 50:51.383
Dolores, no!

50:59.474 --> 51:00.642
Teddy.

51:04.104 --> 51:05.147
Don't mind me.

51:09.693 --> 51:12.279
Just... Just trying to look chivalrous.

51:14.156 --> 51:15.198
Oh, Teddy.

51:30.297 --> 51:32.591
You're a low-down son of a bitch.

51:32.799 --> 51:33.842
I know.

51:36.136 --> 51:38.013
I know we both believe the same thing.

51:42.309 --> 51:46.605
No matter how dirty the business,
do it well.

52:08.752 --> 52:11.546
No telling
there's anything worthwhile in that safe.

52:15.050 --> 52:19.554
We should take this sweet little bitch,

52:20.555 --> 52:21.723
just in case.

52:36.905 --> 52:39.574
Problem with the righteous...
They can't shoot for shit.

52:41.076 --> 52:42.828
Making a hell of a racket, though.

52:58.677 --> 52:59.719
You wanted me.

53:01.555 --> 53:03.348
Well, let this be a lesson.

53:07.102 --> 53:08.854
The lesson is...

53:25.328 --> 53:26.371
Oh, Jesus.

53:35.255 --> 53:36.298
Look at that!

53:36.548 --> 53:39.968
I just shot him through the neck!
And his pal here, too.

53:40.302 --> 53:42.387
Look at her wriggle.

53:45.724 --> 53:47.809
Go get that photographer.
I want to get a picture of this.

53:47.976 --> 53:49.853
- Okay.
- Whoo!

53:50.395 --> 53:51.646
<i>You're welcome.</i>

53:51.980 --> 53:54.190
Maybe you'll get to your speech next time.

53:59.321 --> 54:00.488
Oh, Teddy.

54:03.992 --> 54:06.161
At least I got to see you one last time.

54:07.829 --> 54:10.332
You're not going anywhere,
now, hear?

54:10.665 --> 54:12.500
There's a path for everyone.

54:13.960 --> 54:16.087
My path is bound with yours.

54:25.347 --> 54:26.514
Teddy?

54:27.098 --> 54:28.516
Teddy, no.

54:29.142 --> 54:30.185
Please.

54:31.227 --> 54:33.396
No, we've only just begun.

54:46.993 --> 54:48.578
<i>That was good. Hang on. Hang on.</i>

54:48.870 --> 54:50.705
Let me get the hat. Get the hat.

54:51.998 --> 54:53.083
All right.

55:04.719 --> 55:05.804
Help, please.

55:06.221 --> 55:07.389
My father's sick at home,

55:07.555 --> 55:10.016
but I can't just
leave him out here in the street.

55:19.442 --> 55:21.611
Soon this will all feel
like a distant dream.

55:23.279 --> 55:25.532
Until then, may you rest
in a deep and dreamless slumber.

55:31.246 --> 55:32.497
Two more over here.

55:34.582 --> 55:35.625
We got 'em all.

55:47.762 --> 55:49.431
That's all of them.

55:50.015 --> 55:51.933
Any preliminary results?

55:52.100 --> 55:53.727
Most of them are checking out fine.

55:55.603 --> 55:59.107
We had one who definitely was not.

56:21.629 --> 56:23.339
Bring her back online.

56:33.725 --> 56:36.311
Cognition only. No emotional affect.

56:40.690 --> 56:42.650
All right, sweetheart, can you hear me?

56:43.568 --> 56:44.652
Yes.

56:45.070 --> 56:47.322
I'm sorry. I'm not feeling quite myself.

56:47.864 --> 56:49.157
Lose the accent.

56:49.324 --> 56:50.366
Do you know where you are?

56:51.076 --> 56:52.243
I'm in a dream.

56:52.410 --> 56:54.162
<i>That's right, Dolores. You're in a dream.</i>

56:54.579 --> 56:56.331
A dream that could determine your life.

56:57.165 --> 56:59.084
You want to
wake up from this dream, Dolores?

57:00.001 --> 57:01.169
Yes.

57:02.504 --> 57:03.838
I'm terrified.

57:04.005 --> 57:05.548
There's nothing to be afraid of,

57:06.174 --> 57:08.718
as long as you answer
my questions correctly. You understand?

57:09.052 --> 57:10.845
- Yes.
- Good.

57:11.721 --> 57:15.183
First, have you ever
questioned the nature of your reality?

57:15.892 --> 57:16.935
No.

57:17.185 --> 57:18.353
Has anyone around you?

57:19.062 --> 57:22.023
For instance, your father?

57:25.902 --> 57:27.112
<i>He was scared.</i>

57:27.529 --> 57:29.197
<i>He wasn't thinking right.</i>

57:33.535 --> 57:35.120
He showed you a picture.

57:35.954 --> 57:37.247
That's right.

57:40.583 --> 57:42.627
<i>Was there anything odd
about that picture?</i>

57:43.044 --> 57:44.921
<i>No, nothing at all.</i>

57:46.131 --> 57:48.341
<i>It didn't look like anything to me.</i>

57:54.055 --> 57:56.057
If it breached, he needs to be put down.

57:56.224 --> 57:57.559
That's the policy.

57:57.809 --> 58:03.398
Would it not be best for us
to discover why first, Ms. Cullen?

58:08.444 --> 58:09.654
Please.

58:16.786 --> 58:19.789
We've run a full diagnostic,

58:19.956 --> 58:25.420
but the results are, well, confusing.

58:29.591 --> 58:31.217
Now, tell me,
what happened to your program?

58:38.641 --> 58:40.351
When we are born,

58:41.769 --> 58:46.941
we cry we are come
to this great stage of...

58:49.527 --> 58:50.653
Fools.

58:52.322 --> 58:53.364
That is enough.

58:56.117 --> 59:00.288
Tell me, do you have access
to your previous configuration?

59:04.459 --> 59:05.501
Yes.

59:05.668 --> 59:07.337
Access that, please.

59:17.013 --> 59:18.139
What is your name?

59:18.389 --> 59:19.807
Mr. Peter Abernathy.

59:20.141 --> 59:23.353
Mr. Abernathy, what are your drives?

59:24.395 --> 59:26.439
Tend to my herd. Er...

59:26.814 --> 59:28.524
Look after my wife.

59:30.026 --> 59:31.653
Your final drive?

59:32.237 --> 59:35.240
Well, my daughter Dolores, of course.

59:35.698 --> 59:37.450
I must protect Dolores.

59:38.076 --> 59:41.913
I am who I am because of her, and...

59:42.830 --> 59:46.042
Well, I... I wouldn't have it...

59:48.753 --> 59:53.007
I... I wouldn't have it any other...

59:57.512 --> 01:00:00.348
I... I... I have to warn her.

01:00:01.015 --> 01:00:02.058
Warn who?

01:00:02.684 --> 01:00:03.935
Dolores.

01:00:05.353 --> 01:00:07.063
The things they do to her.

01:00:08.606 --> 01:00:09.941
The things you do to her.

01:00:12.402 --> 01:00:14.070
I have to protect her.

01:00:15.071 --> 01:00:16.698
I have to help her. I...

01:00:17.365 --> 01:00:18.700
She's got to get out.

01:00:19.033 --> 01:00:20.702
Very good, Mr. Abernathy.

01:00:20.994 --> 01:00:22.245
<i>That's enough.</i>

01:00:23.079 --> 01:00:28.042
This behavior,
we're miles beyond a glitch here.

01:00:32.046 --> 01:00:34.632
Access your current build, please.

01:00:40.638 --> 01:00:41.764
What is your name?

01:00:44.058 --> 01:00:47.020
Rose is a rose...

01:00:48.563 --> 01:00:49.897
Is a rose.

01:00:52.942 --> 01:00:54.861
What is your itinerary?

01:01:00.408 --> 01:01:02.076
To meet my maker.

01:01:02.994 --> 01:01:04.203
Uh-huh.

01:01:09.417 --> 01:01:11.169
Well, you're in luck.

01:01:11.753 --> 01:01:13.963
And what do you want to say to your maker?

01:01:18.343 --> 01:01:23.848
By most mechanical and dirty hand...

01:01:29.437 --> 01:01:32.357
I shall have such revenges on you...

01:01:34.442 --> 01:01:35.526
Both.

01:01:37.195 --> 01:01:39.155
The things I will do.

01:01:40.114 --> 01:01:43.743
What they are, yet I know not,

01:01:44.285 --> 01:01:47.080
but they will be the terrors of the Earth.

01:01:51.334 --> 01:01:53.544
You don't know where you are, do you?

01:01:56.506 --> 01:01:58.966
You're in a prison of your own sins.

01:02:01.302 --> 01:02:02.303
Turn it off.

01:02:10.812 --> 01:02:12.063
What the hell was that?

01:02:12.313 --> 01:02:14.732
I don't know. He's off script.

01:02:14.899 --> 01:02:16.567
We didn't program any of those behaviors.

01:02:21.864 --> 01:02:23.241
Shakespeare.

01:02:24.992 --> 01:02:28.830
We've used this host in
a number of different roles, have we not?

01:02:28.996 --> 01:02:31.165
Since I've been here,
he's been Abernathy for 10 years.

01:02:31.332 --> 01:02:33.709
He was sheriff for a while before then.

01:02:33.876 --> 01:02:36.546
- And before that...
- The professor.

01:02:37.922 --> 01:02:41.843
Yes, from a horror narrative
called "The Dinner Party."

01:02:42.009 --> 01:02:45.638
He was leader of a group of cultists
out in the desert who turned cannibal.

01:02:45.847 --> 01:02:49.600
He liked to quote Shakespeare,
John Donne, Gertrude Stein.

01:02:50.393 --> 01:02:53.896
I admit the last one is a bit of
an anachronism, but I couldn't resist.

01:02:54.230 --> 01:02:56.691
These are fragments of prior builds.

01:02:57.066 --> 01:02:59.694
<i>The reveries must be
allowing him to access them.</i>

01:02:59.902 --> 01:03:01.529
No cause for alarm, Bernard.

01:03:01.737 --> 01:03:04.949
<i>Simply our old work
coming back to haunt us.</i>

01:03:15.710 --> 01:03:17.962
<i>Your father whispered
something to you.</i>

01:03:18.921 --> 01:03:20.131
What was it?

01:03:22.633 --> 01:03:24.594
He said I shouldn't tell anyone.

01:03:25.887 --> 01:03:27.305
I won't tell anyone else.

01:03:28.264 --> 01:03:29.307
Promise.

01:03:31.893 --> 01:03:36.772
He said, "These violent delights
have violent ends."

01:03:38.649 --> 01:03:40.109
<i>And does that mean
anything to you?</i>

01:03:40.276 --> 01:03:41.319
No.

01:03:42.403 --> 01:03:43.821
I don't think so.

01:03:49.577 --> 01:03:51.287
Have you ever lied to us?

01:03:52.079 --> 01:03:53.122
No.

01:03:54.081 --> 01:03:55.583
Last question, Dolores.

01:03:56.626 --> 01:03:58.336
Would you ever hurt a living thing?

01:03:59.754 --> 01:04:00.838
No.

01:04:01.797 --> 01:04:03.299
Of course not.

01:04:14.810 --> 01:04:16.812
Tilt your head back, please, Peter.

01:04:24.779 --> 01:04:25.988
<i>Wipe's complete.</i>

01:04:26.364 --> 01:04:28.783
You don't think any of that
had an impact on her core code?

01:04:29.450 --> 01:04:30.868
Not good old Dolores.

01:04:32.119 --> 01:04:33.996
You know why she's special?

01:04:34.622 --> 01:04:37.416
She's been repaired so many times,
she's practically brand-new.

01:04:38.459 --> 01:04:39.835
<i>Don't let that fool you.</i>

01:04:41.837 --> 01:04:43.631
She's the oldest host in the park.

01:04:46.217 --> 01:04:47.843
Come on, sweetheart.

01:04:48.010 --> 01:04:49.720
Tell us what you think of your world.

01:04:52.348 --> 01:04:53.516
This world?

01:05:04.527 --> 01:05:07.530
<i>Some people choose
to see the ugliness in this world.</i>

01:05:09.490 --> 01:05:10.533
<i>The disarray.</i>

01:05:14.579 --> 01:05:16.914
Morning, Daddy. You sleep well?

01:05:17.164 --> 01:05:18.583
Well enough.

01:05:19.834 --> 01:05:22.587
You heading out to do
some more of that painting of yours?

01:05:27.508 --> 01:05:29.260
<i>I choose to see the beauty.</i>

01:06:09.467 --> 01:06:12.720
<i>To believe
there is an order to our days...</i>

01:06:16.182 --> 01:06:17.308
<i>A purpose.</i>

01:06:41.749 --> 01:06:44.543
I know things will work out
the way they're meant to.
