Item one... Duck!

(YELLS)

00:26.402 --> 00:28.152
Cubert, you crapscallion!

00:28.278 --> 00:29.696
Why aren't you in school?

00:29.780 --> 00:31.614
I couldn't get past
the protestors.

00:31.699 --> 00:33.282
A bunch of smiling,
angry people

00:33.367 --> 00:35.868
were handing out
these anti-evolution flyers.

00:36.120 --> 00:37.120
(GASPS)

00:37.204 --> 00:39.914
Evolution is under attack
in our schools?

00:39.998 --> 00:41.791
To the Science Mobile!

00:41.875 --> 00:45.378
You mean the ship?
Yes. The Science Mobile!

00:45.504 --> 00:49.132
It's just that you've
never called it that
before, but okay.

00:58.642 --> 01:00.351
I don't understand evolution,

01:00.436 --> 01:03.146
and I have to protect my kids
from understanding it!

01:03.397 --> 01:05.898
We will not give in
to the thinkers!

01:06.275 --> 01:07.275
(ALL CHEERING)

01:09.653 --> 01:12.655
You people are as loud
as you are ignorant.

01:12.740 --> 01:15.491
Now, get back
on your turnip trucks
and go home!

01:15.701 --> 01:16.951
(BOOING)

01:17.828 --> 01:21.330
That is
an insultingly
accurate stereotype, sir!

01:21.415 --> 01:22.915
As a professor of science,

01:23.000 --> 01:27.295
I assure you that we did,
in fact, evolve
from filthy monkey-men!

01:27.379 --> 01:29.005
I cannot speak for you, sir,

01:29.214 --> 01:31.466
but my ancestors
were not monkeys.

01:31.550 --> 01:32.925
They were orangutans.

01:33.010 --> 01:35.553
Hard-working,
patriotic orangutans.

01:35.721 --> 01:37.263
Dr. Banjo?

01:37.347 --> 01:38.389
In the fur.

01:38.474 --> 01:41.100
And I remind you
that evolution is
merely a theory,

01:41.185 --> 01:43.019
like gravity,
or the shape of the Earth.

01:45.647 --> 01:48.566
Hey, Professor,
I'm a flying
spaghetti monster.

01:48.650 --> 01:53.112
You seriously believe
I'm descended from some
kind of flightless manicotti?

01:53.280 --> 01:55.031
Yes!
Oh, please.

01:55.115 --> 01:56.824
A far more logical
explanation is

01:56.909 --> 01:59.660
the undisprovable
science of Creatureism.

01:59.912 --> 02:03.623
All life was created
in its present form
7,000 years ago

02:03.707 --> 02:06.501
by a fantastical creature
from outer space!

02:06.585 --> 02:07.877
Bunk!
Oh!

02:09.505 --> 02:12.632
If your elitist East Coast
evolution is real,

02:12.716 --> 02:14.342
why has no one found
the missing link

02:14.426 --> 02:16.677
between modern humans
and ancient apes?

02:16.762 --> 02:17.887
We did find it.

02:18.263 --> 02:19.972
It's called Homo erectus.

02:20.224 --> 02:22.058
Then you have proven
my case, sir,

02:22.142 --> 02:25.812
for no one has found
the link between apes
and this Homo erectus.

02:25.896 --> 02:28.856
Yes, they have!
It's called Homo habilis.

02:28.941 --> 02:29.941
Ah-ha!

02:30.067 --> 02:31.901
But no one has found
the missing link

02:31.985 --> 02:34.862
between ape
and this so-called
Homo habilis.

02:34.947 --> 02:36.030
Yes, they have!

02:36.114 --> 02:38.825
It's called
Australopithecus africanus!

02:38.909 --> 02:40.701
Oh-ho! I've got you now.

02:42.246 --> 02:45.206
Fair enough,
but where, then,
is the missing link

02:45.290 --> 02:48.167
between apes
and this Darwinius masillae?

02:48.252 --> 02:50.002
Answer me that,
Professor!

02:50.087 --> 02:51.337
(EXCLAIMS)

02:51.421 --> 02:55.091
Okay, granted,
that one missing link
is still missing,

02:55.300 --> 02:58.511
but just because we haven't
found it doesn't mean
it doesn't exist!

02:58.595 --> 02:59.595
(EXCLAIMS)

02:59.680 --> 03:02.849
Things don't exist
simply because
you believe in them.

03:02.933 --> 03:06.018
Thus sayeth
the Almighty Creature
in the Sky!

03:13.861 --> 03:16.696
FARNSWORTH: I'll show
that banana-swilling
poop-slinger!

03:16.780 --> 03:19.657
We just need to find
that last missing link.

03:19.908 --> 03:23.828
I found a missing link.
It seems to be half man,
half toucan.

03:23.912 --> 03:26.831
Not what we're looking for.
Throw it in the soup.

03:29.835 --> 03:31.127
And here's something.

03:31.211 --> 03:33.629
Uh-oh. It's another one
of Fry's dogs.

03:33.755 --> 03:36.132
You find something, Hermes?
Ah, no.

03:39.761 --> 03:40.761
(GROANS)

03:40.846 --> 03:43.472
I hate chiseling
right after a manicure.

03:44.308 --> 03:46.976
Oh! Darn it!
I broke off
one of my fingers!

03:47.185 --> 03:49.645
Look, Cubert.
The neck on this one.

03:49.813 --> 03:52.481
I bet he spent
a fortune on ties!

03:54.151 --> 03:55.359
What, too soon?

03:55.986 --> 04:00.072
(SNORTS) I highly doubt
a Jurassic elaphrosaurid
had access to neckwear.

04:01.325 --> 04:04.827
I knew I should have
gone with the
ring-around-the-collar joke.

04:05.329 --> 04:07.663
Hey, look!
I found a robot fossil!

04:07.831 --> 04:10.750
That's a bedspring,
you dumb bedspring!

04:10.834 --> 04:12.627
There are no robot fossils.

04:12.794 --> 04:15.087
What? Who says
I didn't evolve?

04:15.172 --> 04:16.297
Everybody!

04:16.380 --> 04:20.635
Robots were created
quite recently.
It was in all the papers.

04:20.719 --> 04:22.762
Then explain this!

04:33.523 --> 04:37.526
Java man, Piltdown man,
Manfred Mann.

04:37.986 --> 04:39.737
(GASPS) Eureka!

04:40.113 --> 04:42.823
It's the elusive
missing missing link.

04:42.908 --> 04:45.618
This will show Banjo,
once and for all.

04:45.869 --> 04:47.370
ALL: Yeah!

04:48.538 --> 04:50.373
What the...
AMY: Oh, That's mine.

04:58.048 --> 04:59.382
Hmm. My tux doesn't fit.

04:59.466 --> 05:02.385
Probably because
I've grown so much
since I last wore it.

05:02.469 --> 05:04.720
Or evolved,
one might say.

05:04.805 --> 05:06.347
One might not say that.

05:06.431 --> 05:09.308
Your tux doesn't fit
because you stole it
from a boy.

05:09.518 --> 05:10.977
You mean a man.

05:11.061 --> 05:12.395
It was his Bar Mitzvah.

05:13.146 --> 05:14.897
Welcome, museum members.

05:14.982 --> 05:18.192
Or, as I like to call you,
future exhibits.

05:20.404 --> 05:21.487
He's good.

05:21.571 --> 05:24.240
Tonight we have a new resident
here in the Hall of Hominids,

05:24.324 --> 05:27.868
generously donated
by its discoverer,
Hubert Farnsworth.

05:28.161 --> 05:30.287
Ladies and gentlemen,
Homo Farnsworth.

05:34.084 --> 05:37.003
Once again,
science saves the day.

05:37.087 --> 05:38.337
The end.

05:38.922 --> 05:42.174
And now, to discuss the
scientific implications
of this discovery,

05:42.259 --> 05:45.761
our new museum curator,
Dr. Banjo!

05:49.307 --> 05:52.601
Thank you,
Professor Farnsworth,
for your generous gift,

05:52.686 --> 05:55.271
which has, once and for all,
disproven evolution.

05:57.065 --> 05:58.816
Behold! Homo Farnsworth,

05:58.942 --> 06:01.944
frolicking with dinosaurs
at the moment of creation.

06:03.739 --> 06:06.615
I don't want to live
on this planet anymore.

06:13.915 --> 06:15.166
FARNSWORTH: Faster! Faster!

06:15.250 --> 06:17.710
Just drop me off
at that asteroid over there.

06:20.672 --> 06:23.549
Wow, this planetoid
is completely lifeless.

06:23.633 --> 06:25.551
Not lifeless enough!

06:25.677 --> 06:27.970
Set up my shack
so I can kick you
out of it!

06:29.306 --> 06:30.306
(YELLS)

06:31.099 --> 06:33.309
Professor, is this
your only water source?

06:33.435 --> 06:35.019
It looks like
Diet Dr. Pepper.

06:35.145 --> 06:38.939
It's not that bad.
It's just laden
with toxic minerals.

06:39.024 --> 06:40.483
But not for long.

06:41.276 --> 06:44.445
What's in the tube?
Microscopic Nanobots.

06:46.740 --> 06:50.534
They're tiny robots I designed
to eat up nasty irritants.

06:51.328 --> 06:54.246
Speaking of nasty irritants,
what's gonna become of Cubert?

06:54.372 --> 06:56.373
Who? Oh, my son.

06:56.833 --> 07:00.544
Don't worry.
He's been safely abandoned
with his godfather.

07:01.296 --> 07:05.007
Cubert, I felt we needed
some father-son bonding time,

07:05.092 --> 07:09.261
so I found a couple
of baseball gloves and
boiled them up for lunch.

07:09.346 --> 07:11.430
Why don't you
just go to hell!

07:11.515 --> 07:14.892
Wait! We still have to
discuss the facts of life.

07:15.018 --> 07:16.435
What are they?

07:17.729 --> 07:18.729
(SIGHS)

07:18.814 --> 07:21.732
Okay, I finished moving
the last grand piano.

07:21.817 --> 07:23.067
Now can we have our pizza?

07:23.151 --> 07:25.861
You'll get
your damn pizza,
you parasite!

07:25.946 --> 07:29.490
First, let's see if
my Nanobots have purified
the water yet.

07:32.744 --> 07:33.786
(EXCLAIMS)

07:33.870 --> 07:37.706
The water's as sterile
as my milkman-trusting father.

07:38.041 --> 07:39.125
But what's this?

07:39.209 --> 07:41.794
The Nanobots have
gotten more complex.

07:41.878 --> 07:43.129
What's that you say?

07:43.213 --> 07:46.507
Those robots evolved
all by themselves, you say?

07:46.591 --> 07:49.593
It wasn't by themselves.
I put them there.

07:49.678 --> 07:51.720
I'm a genius.
Get over it!

07:51.972 --> 07:53.639
Hey, look.
Now they got bigger.

were in there!

08:16.913 --> 08:17.997

out of here!

08:27.215 --> 08:30.217
Look, there's a cave-like hole
in that mountain.

It might be a cave.

08:50.030 --> 08:52.865
and just enough precious food
to ward off starvation.

08:52.949 --> 08:54.533
It's pizza time!

08:56.953 --> 08:58.245
Pineapple?

08:58.663 --> 09:00.623
Oh, man!
So much for that.

09:03.168 --> 09:06.212
Hello. I remembered
you liked superheroes,

09:06.296 --> 09:08.464
so I painted you a mural
on your wall.

09:08.882 --> 09:10.424
This is Father-Man.

to earn Son-Boy's

This is sucky!

three-point perspective?

09:19.017 --> 09:21.852
I could make a better mural
with my butt!

So, what do we got to eat
that's not poisoned
with pineapple?

09:38.536 --> 09:43.082
I packed plenty of food,
but it's all in
dehydrated pill form.

09:43.166 --> 09:45.125
Then we need water
from that pond.

09:45.210 --> 09:47.461
We'll have to fight our way
past the Trilobots.

12:06.518 --> 12:08.644
I'm off to pottery class,
dorkwads.

12:10.730 --> 12:12.022
And that's that.

12:12.107 --> 12:15.943
Whoa! You're
like some kind
of dumpster Jedi.

12:16.319 --> 12:19.154
So, you want to
come in maybe?

12:19.489 --> 12:22.658
I've got a nice pound cake
with a footprint on it.

Don't eat my butt!

12:31.084 --> 12:34.044
If this is anything like
killing that pigeon
on my balcony,

12:34.129 --> 12:35.921
we've got our work
cut out for us.

(TIRES SQUEALING)

Look out, a solar flare!

13:01.448 --> 13:02.906
What the shmell happened?

13:02.991 --> 13:04.491
A mass extinction.

13:05.076 --> 13:08.579
That solar flare
created a huge
electromagnetic pulse

13:08.663 --> 13:10.956
that, while harmless
to organic life,

13:11.040 --> 13:13.459
short-circuited
the robo-dinosaurs.

13:13.543 --> 13:14.626
Convenient.

13:14.711 --> 13:18.172
Only puny mammal-like robots
cowering in caves

13:18.256 --> 13:20.048
could survive such
a catastrophe.

13:21.301 --> 13:24.052
Guys, guys!
I taught myself to knit.

13:24.220 --> 13:25.554
Wait a moment.

13:26.055 --> 13:29.558
If we could scavenge
the right parts
from these robo-dinos,

13:29.642 --> 13:32.644
I might be able to construct
a rudimentary spaceship

13:32.729 --> 13:34.396
to get us off this planet!

13:37.442 --> 13:41.528
Oh, well, it took
almost two hours,
but it's finished.

It's solar powered,
so we can't take off
until sunrise.

Well, let's find something
comfy to bed down on.

(SCREAMING)

14:43.675 --> 14:47.719
(GASPS) Those robo-cavemen
have kidnapped our
human regular-women.

14:47.804 --> 14:48.804
We gotta save them!

14:48.888 --> 14:51.473
But the only weapon we have
is my fan dance.

14:52.100 --> 14:56.728
Hmm. I believe I can
fashion a slingshot using
this robot wishbone

14:56.813 --> 14:59.147
and this elastic
from my pants.

15:03.903 --> 15:05.237
(GRUNTING)

15:07.865 --> 15:10.576
I think they want wives,
so just play along.

15:10.660 --> 15:13.537
If it doesn't work out,
we'll still get
half their rocks.

15:13.621 --> 15:17.749
I can earn my own rocks.
Also, I don't want any rocks.

15:18.418 --> 15:22.421

we'll slingshot them

15:42.859 --> 15:44.985
What's going on?
How did we save you?

15:45.069 --> 15:46.445
It was
the weirdest thing.

15:46.529 --> 15:50.365
We went to sleep,
and when we woke up,
our cave husbands were gone.

15:50.450 --> 15:52.492
I'm gonna miss Spencer.

where organic life
and robotic life evolved
side by side.

16:22.940 --> 16:24.107
Amazing.

I never had any proof.

You all evolved
from some filth-gobbling
Nanobots I designed.

17:19.372 --> 17:22.457
I dumped them
in one of your ponds
a few days ago.

The Earth was created

Yes, relative to you,
it was eons,

17:32.385 --> 17:36.304

this hologram I took
the day before yesterday
