00:24.000 --> 00:30.040
This programme some scenes which
some viewers may find upsetting
and some violent scenes.

00:38.600 --> 00:40.720
There are no mysteries.

00:40.720 --> 00:42.800
Not any more.

00:42.800 --> 00:46.240
No fairy-tales. No fables.

00:46.240 --> 00:48.920
The giants have been banished.

00:48.920 --> 00:51.520
The dragons have been bled.

00:51.520 --> 00:55.400
Science has found a way
to eradicate them.

00:55.400 --> 00:58.840
Reason has vanquished
the human imagination.

00:58.840 --> 01:00.760
FAINT GIGGLING

01:00.760 --> 01:04.320
There is only one frontier
that is unexplored by man.

01:04.320 --> 01:08.200
Only one place
where the dragons roam free.

01:08.200 --> 01:11.840
The human brain is the only
uncharted land.

01:11.840 --> 01:13.880
CLASSICAL MUSIC PLAYS

01:47.160 --> 01:49.920
Let me help you.

01:49.920 --> 01:54.560
What happened? Leave me.
Calm down. Don't touch me.

02:38.040 --> 02:41.880
SHE SHRIEKS WEAKLY

02:43.280 --> 02:44.720
Good morning.

03:14.680 --> 03:17.560
Countess Sophia Nadazdy.

03:17.560 --> 03:21.640
63. Widowed.
Married a Hungarian Count.

03:21.640 --> 03:25.080
That's how she got her title
and her diamonds.

03:28.480 --> 03:29.960
Housekeeper. Frau Reiss.

03:32.440 --> 03:34.680
Who found her?Her maid.

03:37.400 --> 03:38.960
Still in shock.

03:44.640 --> 03:47.760
How long had the Countess
been staying? A month.

03:47.760 --> 03:51.160
And why did she come to Vienna?
Gentlemen.

03:53.520 --> 03:54.880
Dr Jaeger.

04:01.720 --> 04:05.960
Maybe an accident.
She fell, hit her head?

04:05.960 --> 04:07.720
No sign of blood.

04:11.280 --> 04:15.440
Did someone maybe hold her down?
No bruises. No sign of a struggle.

04:15.440 --> 04:17.680
Suicide, most likely.

04:38.760 --> 04:40.760
A gift, never sent.

04:42.480 --> 04:46.040
There's a prescription here.
Opium.

04:46.040 --> 04:49.000
Standard treatment for melancholia.

04:50.960 --> 04:53.520
So she was in Vienna
because she was sick?

04:55.880 --> 04:58.680
Tell me, who was treating her?

05:13.240 --> 05:15.600
You want me to describe it?

05:17.760 --> 05:20.240
I don't know if I can, Doctor.

05:20.240 --> 05:25.080
Sexuality is a natural part of every
person's identity, Frau Huber.

05:25.080 --> 05:29.040
But these thoughts,
they are unclean...

05:29.040 --> 05:34.080
Fantasies are simply
a part of the sexual appetite.

05:34.080 --> 05:38.320
Entertaining them doesn't make you
corrupt, doesn't make you evil,

05:38.320 --> 05:40.880
it doesn't even mean that you
actually want these things

05:40.880 --> 05:47.760
to happen to you. It's just they are
a part of the process of arousal.

05:51.760 --> 05:55.400
Frau Liebermann.
Inspector Rheinhardt.

05:58.720 --> 06:01.320
I'm looking for your brother.

06:01.320 --> 06:03.720
He's with a patient.

06:05.480 --> 06:07.800
I'm not sure it's convenient.

06:12.240 --> 06:14.280
Oh, excuse me.

06:15.840 --> 06:18.720
In a week, then.
We'd better be going.

06:20.760 --> 06:22.080
Frau Liebermann.

06:28.280 --> 06:33.080
I've no idea why I'm saying this
but...it's good to see you, Oskar.

06:34.520 --> 06:36.000
Max.

06:37.200 --> 06:38.640
Please, come in.

06:47.240 --> 06:50.840
Apparently, you've been busy.
Private practice,

06:50.840 --> 06:53.960
just getting started. I'm still
at the hospital two days a week.

06:53.960 --> 06:56.720
Gruner hasn't quite managed
to get rid of me yet.

06:56.720 --> 07:01.080
I assume it's a case,
is that why you've come?

07:01.080 --> 07:03.800
Yes, it's a case.

07:03.800 --> 07:05.720
But this is official.

07:06.800 --> 07:10.200
Countess Sophia Nadazdy,
a patient of yours.

07:10.200 --> 07:13.040
An appointment with you,
three days ago.

07:13.040 --> 07:17.760
Hm. Well...I'm afraid
I can't talk about it.

07:19.120 --> 07:21.880
She's dead, Max.

07:21.880 --> 07:24.520
Discovered this morning.

07:24.520 --> 07:27.960
Drowned in her bathtub,
her suite at The Imperial.

07:27.960 --> 07:29.440
Looks like suicide.

07:41.000 --> 07:42.920
I understand.

07:42.920 --> 07:44.840
It must be difficult.

07:49.240 --> 07:51.560
Anything you can tell me about her?

07:54.960 --> 07:56.320
It's confidential.

08:00.600 --> 08:04.760
Well...there is nothing more
to be said.

08:06.680 --> 08:10.640
May I visit the scene?
The place where she died.

08:10.640 --> 08:14.560
It's a police enquiry.
It's confidential too, Max.

08:14.560 --> 08:18.840
Well, I need to understand
what happened.

08:18.840 --> 08:20.840
You want me
to open up my case to you

08:20.840 --> 08:23.560
but you're not willing
to give me anything in return?

08:38.800 --> 08:42.280
CLAMOURING

08:51.280 --> 08:55.360
Hypothesis.
A woman is troubled by melancholy.

08:55.360 --> 08:58.000
She travels to Vienna
for the latest cure.

08:59.440 --> 09:03.040
She visits a doctor,
but he is unable to help her.

09:05.120 --> 09:07.360
She decides to end her life.

09:07.360 --> 09:10.080
She runs a bath and kills herself.

09:12.960 --> 09:17.560
That's what's going
in the police report? Maybe.

09:17.560 --> 09:18.800
Maybe not.

09:27.000 --> 09:31.520
Looks to me like she walked out
on her life at a moment's notice.

09:34.040 --> 09:37.640
Is it usual
to buy a gift for someone
that you're never going to send?

09:40.960 --> 09:43.040
I had a good teacher.

09:45.120 --> 09:47.400
I don't believe she killed herself.

09:48.760 --> 09:51.960
Too many pieces don't fit.

09:51.960 --> 09:54.160
You can help me get to know her.

09:55.680 --> 09:58.240
Please, Max.

09:58.240 --> 10:00.880
I told you, Oskar,

10:00.880 --> 10:03.440
what goes on in my office
is confidential.

10:05.120 --> 10:08.360
Max.You know Vienna.

10:08.360 --> 10:11.000
Reputation is everything.

10:11.000 --> 10:13.720
Visiting a psychoanalyst
is still a cause for gossip.

10:13.720 --> 10:16.360
For God's sake, Max.
She's dead.

10:16.360 --> 10:19.160
You don't have loyalty
to a dead woman.

10:19.160 --> 10:21.800
Your reputation
hangs in the balance here.

10:21.800 --> 10:24.080
I can't betray her trust.

10:26.320 --> 10:28.240
Even beyond the grave.

10:30.200 --> 10:31.960
For your office.

10:31.960 --> 10:33.920
You desperately need curtains.

10:35.400 --> 10:38.480
Mama, you shouldn't have. You can't
have all those wealthy patients

10:38.480 --> 10:42.560
being gawped at from the street.
There's not too many patients.

10:42.560 --> 10:46.520
Not yet. You just wait. They'll all
come flocking. Mark my words.

10:46.520 --> 10:48.000
What's wrong?

10:49.120 --> 10:52.080
I lost a patient.
What do you mean lost?

10:53.520 --> 10:55.760
HE EXHALES

10:55.760 --> 10:57.160
She's dead.

10:58.480 --> 11:01.440
Died this morning.

11:01.440 --> 11:04.240
Drowned in her hotel suite.

11:04.240 --> 11:08.360
Oh, Max, how awful.

11:08.360 --> 11:11.040
Possible suicide,
they're not sure yet.

11:14.760 --> 11:18.480
I sit in a room with them
for just a few hours,

11:18.480 --> 11:21.560
think that I have
all the answers but...

11:22.960 --> 11:25.600
..feel like I'm just
stumbling around blind.

11:27.360 --> 11:29.720
Honestly, Mama, I don't know
what I've been playing at.

11:29.720 --> 11:32.280
You can't blame yourself, surely.

11:34.040 --> 11:35.560
Max, what is it?

11:36.960 --> 11:40.560
She was seeing Gruner at the
hospital before she came to me.

11:42.040 --> 11:44.440
I advised her not to take his pills.

11:46.360 --> 11:49.400
A few days later she ends up dead.

11:49.400 --> 11:51.520
You must realise how that seems.

11:51.520 --> 11:55.000
Ah. Everyone's in here, I see.

11:55.000 --> 11:57.040
What's the matter? What's going on?

11:57.040 --> 11:59.080
Just trying to brighten up
his office.

11:59.080 --> 12:01.080
The rent on that place
is extortionate.

12:01.080 --> 12:03.720
I am hoping for some return
on my investment, Max.

12:03.720 --> 12:06.200
Your new business is costing me
an arm and a leg.

12:06.200 --> 12:08.200
Perhaps you'd better
ask for it back.

12:13.200 --> 12:15.360
I was only teasing.

12:15.360 --> 12:17.280
What's the matter with him?

12:21.160 --> 12:23.080
September the 7th.

12:23.080 --> 12:26.600
Countess Sophia Nadazdy.
Introductory session.

12:26.600 --> 12:30.800
Already had some consultations with
Gruner, agreed to become my patient.

12:30.800 --> 12:34.280
Gruner prescribed opium
for melancholy and depression.

12:34.280 --> 12:36.200
I advised against taking it.

12:36.200 --> 12:38.720
The disreputable science,

12:38.720 --> 12:40.520
isn't that what they're calling it?

12:40.520 --> 12:44.160
You don't trust psychoanalysis?
I have doubts.

12:44.160 --> 12:47.360
Yet you travelled halfway across
town to meet with me, Countess.

12:47.360 --> 12:52.040
Touche.If you think my methods
are disreputable

12:52.040 --> 12:54.200
then why did you agree to come?

12:56.560 --> 13:01.080
Tell me something, do people
find you easy to dislike, Doctor...

13:01.080 --> 13:03.120
Liebermann. Liebermann.

13:03.120 --> 13:05.680
September the 12th.

13:05.680 --> 13:10.040
No ring on your finger.
You're not married.

13:10.040 --> 13:12.680
I'm not the patient, Countess.

13:12.680 --> 13:15.160
Well, we're just two people talking.

13:15.160 --> 13:18.800
Conversation ought to flow
both ways.

13:18.800 --> 13:22.080
Not married.
Successful, professional.

13:22.080 --> 13:26.520
Good prospects. What is it
that women find hard to bear?

13:26.520 --> 13:29.960
Your inquisitorial manner or...

13:29.960 --> 13:31.920
SHE SNIFFS

13:31.920 --> 13:34.520
Or the smell of your cologne?

13:34.520 --> 13:37.200
I'm not your enemy, Countess.

13:37.200 --> 13:39.600
You pay a considerable
amount of money to be here

13:39.600 --> 13:41.640
and yet we simply side-step
around each other.

13:44.000 --> 13:48.360
There's a girl. A little girl.

13:48.360 --> 13:51.680
I need to tell you her story.

13:51.680 --> 13:54.440
A girl? Blanka.

13:55.840 --> 13:58.480
That was her name.
Blanka Mar.

14:00.800 --> 14:02.280
Pale.

14:04.960 --> 14:07.720
Blue eyes.

14:07.720 --> 14:09.560
Tell me about Blanka.

14:14.760 --> 14:16.200
Not today.

14:17.920 --> 14:21.400
Maybe...never.

14:38.080 --> 14:39.560
Liebermann.

14:40.640 --> 14:42.320
Thank you.

14:42.320 --> 14:45.480
A word, if you please.

14:50.360 --> 14:54.040
It says you'd been seeing her as
a patient at your practice in town.

14:57.800 --> 15:00.920
I'm afraid I can't comment,
Professor... The woman is dead.

15:00.920 --> 15:02.760
Don't play games with me,
Liebermann.

15:02.760 --> 15:05.240
You coerced her to leave my care.
I didn't coerce her...

15:05.240 --> 15:08.120
You treated her with your own
appalling methods.Professor...

15:08.120 --> 15:11.160
..and she ends up
taking her own life.

15:11.160 --> 15:14.400
You can't worm your way out of it,
not like last time.

15:14.400 --> 15:18.600
This time you'll end up in front
of a disciplinary committee.

15:18.600 --> 15:22.160
When I'm done with you, you won't be
able to practise in Vienna.

15:22.160 --> 15:24.960
You'll be forced
to go back to England.

15:39.000 --> 15:41.560
You came to salvage your reputation?

15:41.560 --> 15:45.440
Who gave my name to the newspapers?
It's a Countess, Max.

15:45.440 --> 15:47.720
The hotel is swarming with press.

15:47.720 --> 15:50.000
They pay for any scrap
of information.

15:51.840 --> 15:57.000
Question now is...what are you
going to do about it?Oskar.

16:02.840 --> 16:05.760
We both need to know how she died.

16:05.760 --> 16:07.840
Me because I have to solve a crime,

16:07.840 --> 16:11.960
you because you have to
salvage your career. So...

16:11.960 --> 16:14.880
..if you want to share some
information,

16:14.880 --> 16:17.040
then maybe we could help each other.

16:20.280 --> 16:22.800
What exactly are these
interviews for?

16:22.800 --> 16:25.040
The newspapers said it was suicide.

16:25.040 --> 16:27.880
Just gathering all the evidence,
Herr Director.

16:27.880 --> 16:33.920
UNTRANSLATED

16:37.200 --> 16:40.280
What did she say?
I think she said,

16:40.280 --> 16:43.880
"Evil. Evil walks here.

16:43.880 --> 16:46.160
"With a woman's face."

16:55.480 --> 16:57.920
You're the one
they're talking about.

16:59.480 --> 17:03.480
The one whose name is in the papers.
The Freudian.

17:07.760 --> 17:09.240
Thank you, Herr Director.

17:16.120 --> 17:19.000
She suffered badly. Melancholia.

17:19.000 --> 17:22.200
Did she ever threaten violence
against herself?

17:22.200 --> 17:24.840
Prescribed medicine,

17:24.840 --> 17:26.800
but then she stopped taking them,

17:26.800 --> 17:28.880
at her doctor's advice.

17:28.880 --> 17:31.840
Your advice, Doctor Liebermann.

17:36.200 --> 17:39.320
Heard her crying in her room
most nights, sir, wailing,

17:39.320 --> 17:45.080
like she was tormented.
Had these desperate fits of anger.

17:45.080 --> 17:49.080
Broke the crockery
and stormed out of the ballroom.

17:51.240 --> 17:54.760
Well, you are the bell-boy...

17:54.760 --> 17:58.360
Walter, sir. Walter.

17:58.360 --> 18:00.760
Anything you can tell us?

18:03.880 --> 18:05.360
Well?

18:05.360 --> 18:10.680
Actually, yes, sir, I reckon I was
the last one who saw the Countess.

18:10.680 --> 18:13.800
I was on duty, sir, upstairs.

18:13.800 --> 18:15.520
And?

18:15.520 --> 18:19.680
Her face, it was all twisted.

18:19.680 --> 18:23.800
You mean like she'd been crying?
No.

18:23.800 --> 18:27.000
Like it was made of wax,

18:27.000 --> 18:28.880
like it had been melting.

18:31.320 --> 18:35.160
Melted?
So the witness claimed.

18:36.400 --> 18:39.040
As if her skin
was sliding off her face.

18:39.040 --> 18:41.360
We need you to do
a full postmortem.

18:41.360 --> 18:43.400
Er, who's "we", Doctor Liebermann?

18:43.400 --> 18:47.640
Your reputation is tarnished,
to say the least.

18:47.640 --> 18:51.120
Please, do as he asked.
Thank you.

19:04.880 --> 19:06.960
You wanted to see me, sir?

19:06.960 --> 19:10.320
You were interviewed
with all the other staff.

19:10.320 --> 19:14.800
And?
And I told them what I knew, sir.

19:14.800 --> 19:16.920
I told them I saw her.
Dammit, Walter.

19:16.920 --> 19:20.720
I didn't tell them anything more,
sir. You know why people come here?

19:20.720 --> 19:24.360
You know why
they choose to stay with us?

19:24.360 --> 19:26.240
Because we're secret-keepers.

19:29.360 --> 19:31.680
Everyone has secrets.

19:31.680 --> 19:34.040
It's our job to preserve them.

19:38.880 --> 19:41.920
Anything our clients desire.

19:41.920 --> 19:44.920
That's The Imperial's reputation.

19:44.920 --> 19:46.040
Yes, sir.

19:59.960 --> 20:03.000
INDISTINCT CHATTER

20:07.360 --> 20:09.400
LAUGHTER

20:09.400 --> 20:13.440
WEAK SHRIEKING

20:35.400 --> 20:40.520
Strychnine? Produces convulsions in
the muscles, particularly the face.

20:42.040 --> 20:45.840
She was poisoned?
Dead before she hit the water.

20:45.840 --> 20:48.200
Thank you, Doctor Jaeger.
You're welcome.

20:51.600 --> 20:54.720
There was no obvious sign of it
in her room.

20:54.720 --> 20:56.760
Unlikely it was self-administered.

20:59.480 --> 21:02.160
Maybe this is a murder case
after all.

21:04.040 --> 21:05.640
Stop smiling.

21:05.640 --> 21:08.080
I'm not smiling. It's relief.

21:08.080 --> 21:11.880
With a smile, you're not
in the clear, not yet.I know.

21:11.880 --> 21:14.400
She's still dead, Max.

21:33.280 --> 21:34.440
Max.

21:36.440 --> 21:37.480
Clara.

21:44.920 --> 21:48.400
How are you? How-how is everything?
I didn't expect to see you.

21:48.400 --> 21:51.520
You know Herr Korngold? Jonas.

21:51.520 --> 21:54.480
Yes, yes. Of course. Max.

21:54.480 --> 21:58.000
I've just read your name
in the newspaper.Ah.

21:58.000 --> 22:01.440
Yes, it's not very fashionable
to be seen with me today.

22:01.440 --> 22:05.880
Still fighting battles
on every front. You don't change.

22:12.160 --> 22:15.160
It's no more than he deserves
after the way he treated you.

22:15.160 --> 22:16.400
Don't, Jonas.

22:18.400 --> 22:19.880
Doctor Liebermann?

22:23.800 --> 22:25.520
I didn't catch your name.

22:30.960 --> 22:32.920
Are you going to tell me?

22:32.920 --> 22:36.120
Yannick, sir. Neubauer.

22:36.120 --> 22:38.960
Yannick, please.

22:38.960 --> 22:40.320
So...

22:42.640 --> 22:44.920
..how can I help you?

22:44.920 --> 22:46.760
I have something precious.

22:48.480 --> 22:52.760
Something belonging to her, sir.
Her? The lady,

22:52.760 --> 22:55.360
the one who died at the hotel.

23:01.240 --> 23:04.000
She said I deserved it, sir.

23:05.960 --> 23:07.880
After everything I did for her.

23:10.000 --> 23:12.520
Fetching and carrying,
running errands.

23:12.520 --> 23:15.120
I see. It's a gift.

23:15.120 --> 23:17.480
She liked you. You helped her.

23:18.960 --> 23:23.800
And you didn't want to be accused
of stealing it. No, sir, I don't.

23:23.800 --> 23:26.080
And you thought I could help?

23:26.080 --> 23:29.960
I thought you could say
she left it here, sir.

23:29.960 --> 23:34.480
Dropped it, maybe. I remembered
she came here once before.

23:34.480 --> 23:37.520
I remembered the address
she gave the driver.

23:37.520 --> 23:39.240
Yes, well.

23:39.240 --> 23:42.480
Yes, I'll give it to the police.
I'll put it with the other evidence.

23:47.840 --> 23:50.240
What's wrong, Yannick?

23:50.240 --> 23:53.160
There's something else, isn't there?

23:53.160 --> 23:55.120
What else did you want to tell me?

23:58.720 --> 24:02.600
You could have put this back
in her room, you didn't have
to come to see me.

24:04.320 --> 24:07.160
You spent time in her company?

24:07.160 --> 24:12.440
There was another gift for someone.
A silver cigarette case.

24:14.000 --> 24:15.840
Do you know who that was for?

24:19.040 --> 24:20.800
Did she have a lover?

24:36.160 --> 24:39.200
Oskar Rheinhardt,
Leopoldstadt Police.

24:39.200 --> 24:41.600
We're looking for Oktav Hauke.

24:41.600 --> 24:43.560
You've found him, gentlemen.

24:51.000 --> 24:54.040
How long have you been here,
in the hotel?

24:57.360 --> 24:59.560
A month.

24:59.560 --> 25:02.080
I plan to stay here for the season.

25:04.040 --> 25:06.640
You knew the dead woman?

25:06.640 --> 25:08.760
Yes.

25:08.760 --> 25:10.960
We dined together on occasion.

25:17.640 --> 25:20.240
Tragic. Hm.

25:20.240 --> 25:22.800
A gift, for you.

25:24.160 --> 25:26.120
From the Countess.

25:29.880 --> 25:32.280
It doesn't have my name on it,
Inspector.

25:33.560 --> 25:36.960
We have a witness on the staff who
says you were often seen together.

25:36.960 --> 25:41.720
We spent a lot of time together,
yes. We became close friends.

25:41.720 --> 25:44.280
A woman old enough
to be your mother?

25:44.280 --> 25:47.760
There is no law against two people
becoming acquainted.

25:50.120 --> 25:54.160
You were with her
on the evening she died?

25:54.160 --> 25:56.360
I was at her table, yes.

25:56.360 --> 25:59.200
She left the dining room alone.

25:59.200 --> 26:01.960
Did she seem particularly unhappy?

26:01.960 --> 26:07.560
Not particularly, no. She was
prone to bouts of melancholy.

26:07.560 --> 26:11.560
You must be devastated by her death.
Excuse me?

26:14.000 --> 26:18.160
People have different ways
of expressing their grief.

26:18.160 --> 26:21.360
Now, would you please excuse me
gentlemen?

26:21.360 --> 26:24.560
I'm getting ready for lunch.

26:24.560 --> 26:28.160
You're an Uhlan.
Just resigned my commission.

26:31.720 --> 26:34.680
So you decided to have
a little holiday.

26:34.680 --> 26:38.760
In a hotel filled with widows.

26:38.760 --> 26:42.120
Thank you so much
for dropping by, gentlemen.

26:48.240 --> 26:49.720
Morning. Morning.

26:51.400 --> 26:53.080
Morning, Rheinhardt.

26:58.400 --> 27:00.480
Oh, sorry.

27:00.480 --> 27:02.560
I didn't realise you were cleaning.

27:02.560 --> 27:04.720
Fraulein Linder.

27:04.720 --> 27:07.360
What? I'm the new archivist.

27:08.760 --> 27:09.800
Oh.

27:11.960 --> 27:15.040
What happened to Pichler?
Retired.

27:17.880 --> 27:19.960
Now, can I help you?

27:19.960 --> 27:23.640
Yes, erm, I need some research.

27:49.040 --> 27:52.600
Second Lieutenant Oktav Hauke.

27:52.600 --> 27:56.120
Uhlans. Discharged.

27:56.120 --> 27:59.800
Seems the army wanted to be
rid of him pretty fast.

27:59.800 --> 28:03.000
Leaves service with no prospects,

28:03.000 --> 28:07.000
starts slobbering over a woman
twice his age.

28:07.000 --> 28:10.400
Forgive me, please, Fraulein.
I didn't mean to be indelicate.

28:10.400 --> 28:13.800
I'm an employee here, Inspector.

28:13.800 --> 28:16.160
Say what you want to say.

28:24.680 --> 28:28.680
This is a record of what we spoke
about during our sessions. There's
something I want to read to you.

28:28.680 --> 28:33.320
I never understood its significance
before but...I think she foresaw
what was going to happen to her.

28:33.320 --> 28:35.440
Listen to this.

28:35.440 --> 28:37.960
"September the 15th.

28:37.960 --> 28:40.080
"The patient recounted a dream.

28:40.080 --> 28:44.200
"One she said she'd been having

28:44.200 --> 28:50.760
"again and again
and again and again."

28:57.360 --> 29:01.080
I'm in the park. Alone.

29:02.880 --> 29:06.040
The place is shrouded in mist.

29:09.920 --> 29:15.080
A nanny pushes a pram
along the path, just out of reach.

29:16.800 --> 29:18.840
There's a large...

29:18.840 --> 29:23.960
There's a large white building
in the park

29:23.960 --> 29:28.520
like a fairy-tale palace.
I go in.

29:28.520 --> 29:33.480
Animals live wild inside, they're
watching me from the shadows.

29:38.000 --> 29:41.040
There are sweets and candy.

29:42.640 --> 29:47.920
Like in the fairy-tale, the witch's
house in Hansel And Gretel.

29:49.840 --> 29:53.240
I find the woman sitting inside.

29:54.960 --> 30:00.320
I hold out my arms
to take care of the little child.

30:05.160 --> 30:11.000
But it turns into a bundle of...
of rags and dust.

30:23.960 --> 30:28.000
CHILDREN GIGGLE

30:35.000 --> 30:37.040
MAN LAUGHS

30:40.000 --> 30:42.040
WOMAN LAUGHS

30:45.320 --> 30:46.480
Countess?

30:46.480 --> 30:47.800
SHE GASPS

30:53.440 --> 30:56.040
Do you have any children?
Oh, none.

30:59.520 --> 31:04.160
Doctor Liebermann,
what do you think it signifies?

31:06.680 --> 31:12.600
The unconscious mind,
it's like a pool of dark water.

31:12.600 --> 31:17.400
And then, when we dream, images
shoot up and out, like a fountain.

31:20.440 --> 31:22.280
Perhaps...

31:22.280 --> 31:25.600
Perhaps you are thinking about
that little girl.

31:28.920 --> 31:33.840
Well, I sense that something
or maybe someone,

31:33.840 --> 31:36.880
has frightened you

31:36.880 --> 31:39.760
and you're trying to find a way
to tell me.

31:41.160 --> 31:46.120
Do you think you can ever
truly know someone?

31:46.120 --> 31:47.840
I don't quite follow...

31:47.840 --> 31:51.040
People. People close to you.

31:51.040 --> 31:55.400
People who claim to love you.

31:55.400 --> 31:59.080
H-H-How can you ever
really know them?

32:00.640 --> 32:01.680
Hmm?

32:03.040 --> 32:06.480
What if...
What if somebody you loved

32:06.480 --> 32:11.600
had done something truly
terrible in the past,

32:11.600 --> 32:16.480
a secret so dark, so frightening...

32:18.840 --> 32:20.800
Hm.

32:20.800 --> 32:25.000
What if they appeared so charming...

32:27.720 --> 32:30.880
..but underneath the mask...

32:34.960 --> 32:38.320
Sorry, Doctor Liebermann.

32:40.600 --> 32:45.040
So, she was scared of someone?
Someone very close to her?

32:46.480 --> 32:50.240
Any clue to their identity?Whoever
they are, they're in this dream.

32:51.600 --> 32:55.640
This is where our darkest fears
rise to the surface.

32:55.640 --> 32:59.480
I think she was afraid
someone was going to kill her.

33:02.200 --> 33:05.760
So, this is what you're bringing me?

33:05.760 --> 33:11.080
This is your great discovery?
A fairy-tale palace? Inspector. Yes?

33:14.320 --> 33:17.440
What is this? Leonie Hutter.

33:17.440 --> 33:23.840
Who? Landlady. Leopoldstadt. Another
widow. I found her in the archives.

33:23.840 --> 33:26.880
Died in an accident. Drowned.

33:26.880 --> 33:29.280
Why are you bringing me this?

33:29.280 --> 33:31.680
Where's the connection to Hauke?

33:31.680 --> 33:34.120
He was lodging with her
at the time of her death.

33:38.280 --> 33:40.160
All right.

33:40.160 --> 33:43.280
We get a warrant tomorrow.
Search his room.

33:56.280 --> 33:59.560
He's not worthy
of the Uhlan's uniform.

33:59.560 --> 34:03.960
We all knew what he was up to,
sniffing round the old widow.

34:03.960 --> 34:08.160
You recognise the insignia?
My son was an Uhlan.

34:11.000 --> 34:13.280
Thank you, Frau Reiss.
You can leave us.

34:17.000 --> 34:18.280
Thank you.

34:27.880 --> 34:30.080
You have to ask yourself,

34:30.080 --> 34:35.320
if he's guilty
then why remain here, in the hotel?

34:35.320 --> 34:37.480
Something must be keeping him here.

34:39.080 --> 34:41.080
KNOCK ON DOOR

34:41.080 --> 34:44.160
Inspector.Amelia.

34:44.160 --> 34:47.360
Er, Miss Lydgate.

34:47.360 --> 34:50.240
I came as soon as I could get away.

34:50.240 --> 34:53.640
Profiling isn't the only thing
that I've learned from you.

34:53.640 --> 34:57.000
Miss Lydgate has been consulting
for us on several cases.

34:58.160 --> 35:01.560
Right. Good.

35:01.560 --> 35:06.440
Strychnine poisoning. If it was
prepared in here I need to know it.

35:06.440 --> 35:09.440
Any evidence that it was handled
in this room.

35:12.560 --> 35:14.400
Excuse me, Doctor Liebermann.

35:16.600 --> 35:18.080
Oh, I'll stay.

35:54.880 --> 35:57.720
Two months. I'm aware.

35:57.720 --> 36:01.000
Two months, four days.

36:01.000 --> 36:03.040
I'm working. Do you mind?

36:04.360 --> 36:06.800
You know how many letters
I sent you?

36:06.800 --> 36:09.200
I feel sure
you're about to remind me.

36:09.200 --> 36:10.280
Three.

36:11.680 --> 36:15.280
Not a single reply.
Funnily enough, I've been busy.

36:15.280 --> 36:19.640
Don't you think that an appropriate
amount of time has gone by?

36:19.640 --> 36:22.400
I think that a young doctor
with a burgeoning reputation

36:22.400 --> 36:24.920
can't afford the stain of scandal.

36:24.920 --> 36:27.120
Particularly now he's in the papers.

36:28.640 --> 36:30.320
Do you mind?

36:32.680 --> 36:34.040
KNOCK ON DOOR

36:39.600 --> 36:42.080
What are you grinning at?
Never mind.

36:45.440 --> 36:49.840
Any signs of poison traces?
Nothing I can find, sorry.

36:49.840 --> 36:52.520
If he prepared it in here,
he sterilised everything.

36:52.520 --> 36:55.080
We need to cast our net wider.

36:59.880 --> 37:02.560
The Countess, I need to know
everything she ate

37:02.560 --> 37:06.880
on her final night here.
What? She was poisoned.

37:06.880 --> 37:09.080
No question.

37:09.080 --> 37:10.760
This is absurd.

37:10.760 --> 37:14.080
We are not responsible.
Miss Lydgate?

37:14.080 --> 37:16.560
What else do you require?

37:16.560 --> 37:20.240
I need to see menu cards,
the contents of your store

37:20.240 --> 37:24.960
and I need the names of every person
who came into contact with her food.

37:24.960 --> 37:28.960
You have women detectives now,
do you?

37:28.960 --> 37:31.080
Just do as you're asked.

37:33.000 --> 37:34.080
Now.

37:48.880 --> 37:50.280
I'm sorry.

38:46.640 --> 38:48.880
Thank you, you can go.

38:54.360 --> 38:59.040
Walnuts, hardboiled eggs
and Champagne?

38:59.040 --> 39:01.120
That's all she ate?

39:01.120 --> 39:04.240
Demanded the same things
every evening.

39:04.240 --> 39:07.800
She bought a few items of her own.
A herbal infusion.

39:07.800 --> 39:10.280
Used her own supplier from England.

39:10.280 --> 39:12.320
The Emperor Augustus.

39:13.560 --> 39:16.800
What?Augustus.

39:16.800 --> 39:20.840
He... He thought his wife
was trying to poison him.

39:20.840 --> 39:26.000
Picked his own figs from the trees,
milked his own goat.

39:26.000 --> 39:29.000
What's this about, exactly?

39:29.000 --> 39:31.840
Eggs and walnuts,
difficult to tamper with.

39:31.840 --> 39:34.560
Impossible to pierce the shell
of an egg without leaving a trace.

39:34.560 --> 39:38.960
So, if it wasn't in the food then...

39:38.960 --> 39:41.600
..how else did he manage it?

39:50.000 --> 39:52.400
How long before dinner
are the tables laid?

39:52.400 --> 39:55.000
Six o'clock. Two hours.

39:57.000 --> 40:01.120
The Countess, did she occupy
the same table every night?

40:20.480 --> 40:22.840
Tell us about the evening she died.

40:22.840 --> 40:27.160
I saw her, maybe
a few minutes before she left.

40:27.160 --> 40:29.760
Her shawl had fallen.

40:29.760 --> 40:32.560
I hung it back on her chair.

40:32.560 --> 40:36.520
Glanced at the table,
I didn't notice anything untoward.

40:36.520 --> 40:39.600
She and that young soldier
were on the dance floor.

40:42.200 --> 40:45.120
I saw the staff
deliver her tea-tray.

40:47.280 --> 40:49.080
It was waiting for her.

40:53.800 --> 40:55.440
Then she cleared the table.

40:58.280 --> 41:00.720
She was poisoned right here.

41:00.720 --> 41:05.440
The tea was the only unchecked
thing she consumed.

41:05.440 --> 41:08.120
Maybe it was in the water.

41:08.120 --> 41:09.480
Maybe the pot?

41:11.000 --> 41:14.920
Maybe he soaked the leaves
in a solution.

41:14.920 --> 41:18.880
"Maybe" is not good enough for us,
Miss Lydgate.

41:18.880 --> 41:21.920
BELL CHIMES

41:27.880 --> 41:29.320
KNOCK ON DOOR

41:31.200 --> 41:34.400
Time you and I had a little chat,
don't you think?Please.

41:34.400 --> 41:36.400
I've been expecting it.

41:38.280 --> 41:40.320
You asked for my investment, Max,

41:40.320 --> 41:43.160
and I gladly put money
into you and your business.

41:43.160 --> 41:44.960
Well, not gladly, let's be honest.

41:44.960 --> 41:48.280
Now I find that your name is
plastered all over the newspapers.

41:48.280 --> 41:52.000
And are you worried about the stain
on our good name or the return
on your investment?

41:52.000 --> 41:54.920
I'm worried about you, my son.

41:54.920 --> 41:58.080
Reputation in this city
is a precious thing.

41:58.080 --> 42:01.920
Well, I'm afraid it's too late
to salvage mine. Here.

42:03.680 --> 42:05.960
A disciplinary hearing.

42:05.960 --> 42:09.280
But you've only just shaken off
the scandal there.

42:09.280 --> 42:12.400
Gruner's not giving up so easily.

42:12.400 --> 42:15.000
If he can't annihilate Freud,
I'm the next best thing.

42:15.000 --> 42:17.040
What do you intend to do?

42:17.040 --> 42:18.600
Fight.

42:18.600 --> 42:22.360
What other option do I have?
Max... Come on.

42:22.360 --> 42:25.400
I'm taking you out. I've finished
the new drapes for your office.

42:25.400 --> 42:27.040
Impress the patients.

42:27.040 --> 42:28.600
It's very generous, all this, Mama,

42:28.600 --> 42:32.040
but you really needn't
have bothered. Stop fussing
and come and have a look.

42:32.040 --> 42:35.200
I came in to hang them yesterday.
They make all the difference.

42:39.160 --> 42:41.960
Did you lock the door?

42:41.960 --> 42:43.160
Of course.

42:55.960 --> 42:57.920
Oh.

42:57.920 --> 42:59.640
Oh, Max.

43:03.280 --> 43:05.880
Who could do such a thing?

43:25.000 --> 43:27.840
You and I
need to have a serious talk.

43:27.840 --> 43:30.880
Mama, please leave those.
But, Max...Take the carriage home.

43:30.880 --> 43:34.680
There's no sense you being here.
Please. Please?

43:34.680 --> 43:36.080
Mrs Liebermann.

43:37.880 --> 43:39.160
Thank you.

43:44.440 --> 43:46.040
What?

43:46.040 --> 43:50.040
When I came to see you,
after I read your name in her diary,

43:50.040 --> 43:53.520
I knew you had access
to her private thoughts.

43:53.520 --> 43:56.560
Well? The killer has
the same notion, apparently.

43:56.560 --> 44:00.520
Oskar. You think
she was frightened by someone,

44:00.520 --> 44:03.240
you think she anticipated
her own death.

44:03.240 --> 44:05.440
Who else would
she tell about her fears,

44:05.440 --> 44:07.920
if not you, her psychoanalyst?

44:07.920 --> 44:12.040
He thinks you know his name.
He thinks you can identify him.

44:12.040 --> 44:15.560
You are in grave danger,
whether you realise it or not, Max.

45:10.960 --> 45:12.080
Nothing.

45:13.360 --> 45:17.320
Not a trace of poison in it.
So, where does that leave us?

45:17.320 --> 45:19.000
The boiling water in the pot,

45:19.000 --> 45:21.440
it's the only thing that could have
been tampered with.

45:23.160 --> 45:26.800
The infusion is bitter,
would have masked the taste of it.

45:26.800 --> 45:29.720
Means it was done
by someone close at hand,

45:29.720 --> 45:33.320
someone right beside her
at the table. Hauke.

45:33.320 --> 45:35.880
Very well, we arrest him.

45:35.880 --> 45:37.560
Miss Lydgate.

45:46.240 --> 45:50.520
Leonie Hutter, your landlady...

45:52.640 --> 45:55.000
..died in an apparent
drowning accident.

45:55.000 --> 45:57.760
Does anyone see a pattern here?

45:57.760 --> 46:00.960
This is really why you arrested me,
Inspector?

46:00.960 --> 46:03.000
She left you money in her will.

46:03.000 --> 46:06.240
Hardly a fortune,
just a modest amount.

46:06.240 --> 46:09.360
Still, when she died,
you were able to claim it

46:09.360 --> 46:11.360
and move on to a wealthier woman.

46:11.360 --> 46:13.440
Isn't that what happened?

46:15.960 --> 46:17.040
Hm?

46:20.960 --> 46:23.880
Our scientist confirmed
she was killed by someone

46:23.880 --> 46:26.200
who laced her teapot
with strychnine,

46:26.200 --> 46:29.640
someone who knew about her precise
rituals and her movements,

46:29.640 --> 46:33.920
someone who was right next to her
that evening.

46:33.920 --> 46:38.360
What would you do for money,
Herr Hauke?

46:38.360 --> 46:41.120
What would you be prepared to do?

46:41.120 --> 46:43.440
Drag a woman into bed
twice your age

46:43.440 --> 46:46.080
and then dispatch her like you
wipe some dirt off your shoe?

46:46.080 --> 46:48.680
We were companions, not lovers.

46:48.680 --> 46:51.880
She was eager to spend money on me.

46:51.880 --> 46:53.040
Hah.

46:54.560 --> 46:57.040
You think I am immoral
for accepting?

47:02.920 --> 47:06.480
How much will you earn from the sale
of her estates in Hungary?

47:07.880 --> 47:12.000
HE LAUGHS

47:12.000 --> 47:14.080
Did I say something funny,
Herr Hauke?

47:14.080 --> 47:16.640
There is no inheritance. What?

47:16.640 --> 47:18.840
She never willed
any of her money to me.

47:18.840 --> 47:21.240
I don't stand to earn a thing.

47:21.240 --> 47:24.440
I suppose you discussed this often?

47:24.440 --> 47:26.760
You don't believe me?

47:26.760 --> 47:28.800
Ask her solicitors.

47:30.040 --> 47:34.720
Whatever you may think of me,
Inspector, a fortune-hunter,

47:34.720 --> 47:36.160
a leech...

47:39.280 --> 47:42.000
..I've always known
I wouldn't get her fortune.

47:42.000 --> 47:45.480
Where is my motive for killing her?

47:58.000 --> 48:01.520
You called the Nadazdy solicitors?
Yes, sir.

48:01.520 --> 48:04.640
And?
Hauke is telling the truth.

48:04.640 --> 48:09.280
The estate returns to the Count's
family after his wife's death.Hm.

48:09.280 --> 48:14.040
There goes your motive.
So Hauke is no longer a suspect.

48:15.440 --> 48:16.920
No, sir.

48:22.000 --> 48:23.480
Five days.

48:25.440 --> 48:27.560
What else have you got for me?

48:27.560 --> 48:30.520
This can't possibly be all
you've achieved?

48:30.520 --> 48:34.280
The investigation is ongoing.
Meaning it's nowhere.

48:34.280 --> 48:36.920
Frankly...

48:36.920 --> 48:40.520
..if I were you,
I'd pray for a miracle.

48:40.520 --> 48:44.160
Sir.She's Hungarian nobility.

48:44.160 --> 48:47.080
A family title and estate.

48:47.080 --> 48:50.760
The Imperial Court
has been asking questions.

48:50.760 --> 48:53.920
Politically,
this is extremely delicate. Sir.

48:53.920 --> 48:57.120
Widow of a Hungarian nobleman!

48:57.120 --> 48:59.600
Dying under suspicious
circumstances.

48:59.600 --> 49:01.480
Get your head out of your

49:01.480 --> 49:03.720
backside and provide me
with something.

49:05.160 --> 49:07.160
Let Hauke go.

49:07.160 --> 49:09.040
Dismissed.

49:20.000 --> 49:22.520
I don't know how much longer
I can stop my fist from connecting

49:22.520 --> 49:24.240
with that grin of his.

49:25.640 --> 49:28.600
There must be something.
A scrap of information?

49:28.600 --> 49:30.440
Max, what haven't you told me?

49:30.440 --> 49:34.960
I've shown you the files,
Oskar, I've shared everything.

49:34.960 --> 49:37.160
The killer must be
somewhere in her dreams.

49:37.160 --> 49:38.640
Come on.

49:39.880 --> 49:41.720
There was one thing.

49:41.720 --> 49:45.680
I never got to the bottom of it
but it might be significant.

49:45.680 --> 49:48.840
What?A name.

49:50.920 --> 49:52.960
Blanka Mar.

49:52.960 --> 49:58.760
Who is she?
Er, well, she may be nobody.

49:58.760 --> 50:00.040
A fantasy.

50:08.280 --> 50:10.600
Max, what's this about?

50:10.600 --> 50:12.920
Our private sessions.

50:12.920 --> 50:16.680
The Countess, whenever she became
upset or disturbed in some way.

50:16.680 --> 50:20.400
she mentioned a girl. Blanka Mar.

50:20.400 --> 50:23.360
At first I thought it was just
a displacement technique,

50:23.360 --> 50:27.120
that the feelings were too painful
so she was ascribing them

50:27.120 --> 50:30.320
to someone else,
to a fantasy character.

50:30.320 --> 50:33.880
And now you've changed your mind?

50:33.880 --> 50:35.320
I don't know, Oskar.

50:36.920 --> 50:39.400
Maybe she's real.

50:39.400 --> 50:40.880
Maybe she's not.

50:52.720 --> 50:54.960
I don't understand.
I thought you'd made an arrest.

50:54.960 --> 50:58.520
We need to begin again.
We need to widen our search.

51:02.000 --> 51:04.360
When exactly is this intrusion
going to end?

51:07.560 --> 51:09.080
Bring in the Russians.

51:12.040 --> 51:16.680
Never spoke to us. She was so...

51:16.680 --> 51:21.040
So consumed by her own sadness.

51:23.440 --> 51:26.600
Oh, what did your wife mean before

51:26.600 --> 51:30.920
when she said there was
"evil" in this hotel?

51:30.920 --> 51:35.480
UNTRANSLATED CONVERSATION

51:40.400 --> 51:43.280
A young woman in white,

51:43.280 --> 51:50.240
my wife saw her
walking outside the Countess' room.

51:50.240 --> 51:53.000
What's so strange
about a young woman in white?

51:53.000 --> 51:56.040
UNTRANSLATED

51:59.040 --> 52:01.480
She had the eyes of a devil.

52:04.920 --> 52:06.040
Thank you.

52:13.920 --> 52:16.040
Superstition, that's all.

52:16.040 --> 52:17.800
She saw another guest.

52:17.800 --> 52:19.480
Look at the list.

52:19.480 --> 52:21.360
There's no young woman
on this floor.

52:23.080 --> 52:26.160
Inspector...there is something else.

52:31.960 --> 52:34.320
It's gone.

52:34.320 --> 52:36.040
It's gone!

52:36.040 --> 52:37.760
I-I swear it was right here.

52:37.760 --> 52:39.760
What did you find?

52:39.760 --> 52:42.320
Erm, a book of pictures.

52:42.320 --> 52:44.160
Erotic images.

52:44.160 --> 52:47.000
You know, the sort of things
you find in brothels.

52:47.000 --> 52:49.960
No. I don't know, as it happens.

52:49.960 --> 52:52.280
What exactly do you mean?

52:52.280 --> 52:55.680
Erm, when the clients
come from abroad

52:55.680 --> 52:57.600
and don't speak the language,

52:57.600 --> 53:01.560
you use a picture book...
to communicate.

53:02.560 --> 53:03.920
A menu.

53:07.040 --> 53:09.680
What are you suggesting goes on
in this hotel?

53:12.440 --> 53:14.920
I think they're trying
to hide a secret.

53:20.640 --> 53:22.720
SICKLY MOANING

53:39.800 --> 53:42.000
I believe we were talking
about deception.

53:44.000 --> 53:46.360
Someone close to you
deceiving you in some way.

53:53.200 --> 53:58.160
Do you harbour feelings of...
anger or betrayal?

54:01.440 --> 54:04.120
Countess?

54:04.120 --> 54:06.400
Blanka.

54:06.400 --> 54:08.040

55:31.400 --> 55:32.440
Nothing, sir.

55:33.720 --> 55:37.200
I assume you've had your summons
to the disciplinary board?

55:37.200 --> 55:39.480
I still have my duties
to attend to here.

55:39.480 --> 55:41.840
Not for much longer, I'd wager.

55:42.880 --> 55:45.800
We're out of Bromide.
Mr Hofbauer needs his medication.

55:45.800 --> 55:48.480
If you're not too busy,
I'd be grateful.

Come on. Let me take you back up.

57:29.320 --> 57:30.800
Someone was in your office?

57:30.800 --> 57:33.320
Yes, came to the hospital,
took the transcripts.

57:33.320 --> 57:36.000
It's as I thought - he's after you.

57:36.000 --> 57:39.160
You're playing with fire, Max.

57:39.160 --> 57:40.840
Yes.

57:40.840 --> 57:42.960
Don't you see? This means
we have a way to catch him.

57:42.960 --> 57:45.160
He thinks I can identify him.

57:45.160 --> 57:47.520
So, he wants to know what I know.

57:47.520 --> 57:48.840
He needs me.

57:48.840 --> 57:50.800
You're not serious?

57:50.800 --> 57:52.880
All we have to do is wait.

57:55.200 --> 57:57.640
Wait for him to come here again.

I need to see you, Doctor.
It's urgent.

Rather late.
Perhaps if you came back... No.

She? My wife.

59:21.960 --> 59:24.160
She's been coming here
without telling me.

59:26.040 --> 59:27.800
Herr Huber?

59:27.800 --> 59:29.760
She comes here,
and she talks about me.

59:29.760 --> 59:31.280
I know she does!

59:31.280 --> 59:33.760
I won't be humiliated like this.
You understand?

59:33.760 --> 59:35.480
Er, let's discuss this - calmly.

59:35.480 --> 59:38.240
She doesn't desire me any more.
You know about that?

59:38.240 --> 59:41.960
Look... What did she tell you, huh?

59:41.960 --> 59:44.840
That I can't satisfy her?!
Please, I...

59:44.840 --> 59:47.520
What the hell did my wife tell you?

59:47.520 --> 59:49.600
Answer me, you son of a whore!

59:51.480 --> 59:53.520
HE WHIMPERS

59:53.520 --> 59:55.880
Ah! Who the hell are you?!

59:55.880 --> 59:57.920
I'm arresting you. Keep silent.

59:59.120 --> 1:00:01.160
SHACKLES CLINK

1:00:01.160 --> 1:00:02.960
Er, husband of a patient.

1:00:02.960 --> 1:00:05.560
What?It's not the man we're after.

1:00:05.560 --> 1:00:07.000
Sorry, Oskar.

1:00:15.840 --> 1:00:17.280
Sorry.

1:00:19.240 --> 1:00:20.760
Where's my hat?

1:00:25.800 --> 1:00:28.200
Hat. Your hat.

1:00:33.040 --> 1:00:34.560
This is not over.

1:00:47.640 --> 1:00:50.480
Sorry, Oskar.
Trap got sprung by the wrong prey.

1:00:51.800 --> 1:00:54.200
How many people want you dead,
Doctor?

1:00:54.200 --> 1:00:56.160
The list seems to get
longer by the day.

1:01:09.880 --> 1:01:12.480
Inspector. Nothing?

1:01:12.480 --> 1:01:14.720
No mention of her anywhere.

1:01:14.720 --> 1:01:16.280
No "Blanka Mar"?

1:01:19.560 --> 1:01:22.080
Maybe the Doctor's instincts
were right.

1:01:22.080 --> 1:01:25.160
She doesn't exist, as far as
the records are concerned.

1:01:26.920 --> 1:01:29.600
I've been sent with an agenda, Max.

1:01:29.600 --> 1:01:32.400
I'm supposed to mention it casually,
but I can't think how,

1:01:32.400 --> 1:01:35.040
so I'll just come out with it.

1:01:35.040 --> 1:01:36.720
An agenda?

1:01:36.720 --> 1:01:38.760
From your mother.

1:01:38.760 --> 1:01:40.880
Ah. I see.

1:01:42.240 --> 1:01:45.800
Well? We had a letter from Clara.

1:01:45.800 --> 1:01:49.360
She's engaged. Jonas Korngold.

1:01:49.360 --> 1:01:52.000
Ah. Is that all you have to say?

1:01:52.000 --> 1:01:54.040
What do you want me to say?
He's a fine man.

1:01:54.040 --> 1:01:58.040
You're connected to him in business,
makes it neat for everyone.

1:01:58.040 --> 1:02:01.440
I just wanted you to hear it from me
before people started to gossip.

1:02:04.840 --> 1:02:07.280
Oh, Fraulein Spitzer
has returned from travelling.

1:02:07.280 --> 1:02:10.200
You remember the Spitzers?
Lovely people.

1:02:10.200 --> 1:02:11.840
Why are you telling me this part?

1:02:11.840 --> 1:02:13.800
Their daughter's back in Vienna.

1:02:13.800 --> 1:02:16.360
Ah, I see. So, you'd like me
to propose marriage.

1:02:16.360 --> 1:02:19.400
It was just a suggestion.
Tie up all the loose ends.

1:02:19.400 --> 1:02:22.160
We just want you to be content.

1:02:23.840 --> 1:02:26.680
Take the Spitzer girl out,
see if anything comes of it...

1:02:26.680 --> 1:02:29.880
Father, for Heaven's sake. Max.
I'm not a child any more.

1:02:29.880 --> 1:02:32.200
You really don't understand, do you?

1:02:32.200 --> 1:02:36.240
For all your analysis, you still
don't understand human nature.

1:02:37.640 --> 1:02:40.040
When do you think it stops?

1:02:40.040 --> 1:02:43.440
When do you think it ends for us?
When you're 18?

1:02:43.440 --> 1:02:45.520
When do you think we stop worrying?

1:02:45.520 --> 1:02:47.400
The answer is "never".

1:02:47.400 --> 1:02:49.920
The journey is never over.

1:02:49.920 --> 1:02:53.320
You have a child,
your life is inextricably linked

1:02:53.320 --> 1:02:55.320
to theirs forever.

1:02:55.320 --> 1:02:58.400
If they're not happy,
you can't be happy.

1:02:58.400 --> 1:03:00.480
You feel joy in their successes

1:03:00.480 --> 1:03:02.880
and abject misery in their failures.

1:03:02.880 --> 1:03:05.280
Why do you think I was
so eager to loan you the money

1:03:05.280 --> 1:03:06.560
for your business?

1:03:06.560 --> 1:03:08.160
I assume Mother begged you.

1:03:08.160 --> 1:03:11.480
Of course she did.
But I was glad to do it.

1:03:11.480 --> 1:03:15.080
Well, not glad, you were right
when you said as much.

1:03:16.920 --> 1:03:20.680
You'll always be
that little boy to us.

1:03:20.680 --> 1:03:23.520
Max? Are you even listening?

1:03:27.200 --> 1:03:29.480
Max? What's the matter?

1:03:29.480 --> 1:03:32.520
I've got to go. I'm sorry.

1:03:32.520 --> 1:03:34.280
Max?

1:03:34.280 --> 1:03:36.040
A child!

1:03:36.040 --> 1:03:37.800
That's what she was trying to hide!

1:03:51.000 --> 1:03:52.480
She had a child.

1:03:53.960 --> 1:03:56.600
She lied to me -
at some point in her life.

1:03:56.600 --> 1:03:58.080
The Countess Nadazdy...

1:03:58.080 --> 1:04:00.320
Yes, remember the baby
in her dreams? Yes. So what?

1:04:00.320 --> 1:04:02.440
I'm so stupid,
I should have realised.

1:04:02.440 --> 1:04:05.240
The animals weren't real, Oskar,
they were painted on the wall.

1:04:05.240 --> 1:04:08.360
The animals?Yes, and the sweets
in the glass jars, it was medicine.

1:04:08.360 --> 1:04:11.200
It was a hospital, Oskar.

1:04:11.200 --> 1:04:12.560
We lie to children.

1:04:12.560 --> 1:04:14.680
We give them medicine
and pretend that it's sweets.

1:04:14.680 --> 1:04:17.080
W-We paint pictures of animals
on the wall just to make them

1:04:17.080 --> 1:04:18.480
feel more comfortable.

1:04:18.480 --> 1:04:23.040
The feeling that was bubbling away
inside her, it wasn't just fear.

1:04:23.040 --> 1:04:25.280
It was guilt.

1:04:25.280 --> 1:04:28.640
She had a child that she abandoned.

1:04:28.640 --> 1:04:31.440
And that child came
back to find her.

1:04:31.440 --> 1:04:35.600
The person she feared,
it wasn't a lover, Oskar.

1:04:35.600 --> 1:04:37.040
It was her baby.

1:04:47.080 --> 1:04:48.840
We need to know about the child.

1:04:50.120 --> 1:04:52.320
They conceived a son.

1:04:52.320 --> 1:04:54.640
She and her husband, the Count.

1:04:54.640 --> 1:04:57.520
Little boy, beautiful.

1:04:57.520 --> 1:05:00.880
Golden curls. An angel.

1:05:00.880 --> 1:05:03.240
We need to know about him.

1:05:03.240 --> 1:05:06.240
He had everything.
You understand me?

1:05:06.240 --> 1:05:08.160
Everything.

1:05:08.160 --> 1:05:12.480
This boy had more love than
any child has ever been given.

1:05:12.480 --> 1:05:15.880
Spoiled him, I always said.
Changed his nature.

1:05:15.880 --> 1:05:18.360
He had no boundaries, you know?

1:05:18.360 --> 1:05:22.240
There was nothing he couldn't
have if he wanted it.

1:05:22.240 --> 1:05:24.160
He became twisted.

1:05:24.160 --> 1:05:26.800
Terrible things, he did.

1:05:26.800 --> 1:05:29.840
Children came to play at the estate,

1:05:29.840 --> 1:05:31.720
they never came back.

1:05:31.720 --> 1:05:36.720
Their families would never,
ever let them come again.

1:05:36.720 --> 1:05:38.200
Who was Blanka Mar?

1:05:40.520 --> 1:05:43.680
That poor little girl.

1:05:43.680 --> 1:05:45.240
He tortured her.

1:05:47.120 --> 1:05:49.160
Disfigured her.

1:05:49.160 --> 1:05:53.360
The family?
They were paid for their silence.

1:05:53.360 --> 1:05:55.040
SHE SOBS

1:06:02.880 --> 1:06:04.840
SOBBING CONTINUES

1:06:14.200 --> 1:06:16.880
From this moment on...

1:06:16.880 --> 1:06:20.640
..they decided that he had
to be sent away.

1:06:20.640 --> 1:06:23.840
His mother never wanted anyone
to know about him.

1:06:27.760 --> 1:06:29.320
Where is he now?

1:06:29.320 --> 1:06:33.800
They sent him to a sanatorium
when he was nine years old.

1:06:33.800 --> 1:06:36.800
After all the violence,
after the...

1:06:36.800 --> 1:06:39.440
After Blanka.

1:06:39.440 --> 1:06:42.440
They brought him here to Vienna.

1:06:42.440 --> 1:06:45.840
There was a doctor
who took charge of him.

1:06:45.840 --> 1:06:48.080
I can't recall his name.

1:06:48.080 --> 1:06:50.000
The records were destroyed.

1:06:51.960 --> 1:06:57.400
After this day...
it was as if he was dead.

1:06:59.320 --> 1:07:03.160
And then, something happened?

1:07:03.160 --> 1:07:08.080
He was transferred to another place
out of Vienna, when he was older.

1:07:08.080 --> 1:07:10.320
Six months ago they wrote to her,

1:07:10.320 --> 1:07:13.240
telling her that he'd escaped.

1:07:16.000 --> 1:07:19.360
She knew he'd be looking for her.

1:07:21.960 --> 1:07:24.920
Istvan.

1:07:24.920 --> 1:07:29.040
Little Master Istvan,
with the golden curls.

1:07:31.680 --> 1:07:33.960
She never forgave herself.

1:07:33.960 --> 1:07:36.160
That's why she was so unhappy.

1:07:36.160 --> 1:07:38.400
QUIET SOBBING

1:07:46.160 --> 1:07:49.160
It all fits.
Her attraction to Hauke.

1:07:49.160 --> 1:07:52.280
Drawn to a much younger man.
It was displacement.

1:07:52.280 --> 1:07:54.160
You're talking nonsense again, Max.

1:07:54.160 --> 1:07:55.840
Give it to me in plainer language.

1:07:55.840 --> 1:07:57.960
Anyone who's had a broken
relationship some time in

1:07:57.960 --> 1:08:00.360
their past, they spend
their days trying to mend it.

1:08:00.360 --> 1:08:02.520
She lavished her money on
Hauke out of guilt

1:08:02.520 --> 1:08:05.040
for her abandoned son, for Istvan.

1:08:05.040 --> 1:08:08.400
She knew that eventually
he would find her.

1:08:08.400 --> 1:08:10.680
And she was right.

1:08:10.680 --> 1:08:14.120
When she came to Vienna,
he hunted her down...

1:08:15.800 --> 1:08:17.720
..and he killed her.

1:08:17.720 --> 1:08:20.520
CROWS CAW

1:08:35.320 --> 1:08:36.720
Istvan!

1:08:38.360 --> 1:08:40.440
Istvan, I'm a doctor,

1:08:40.440 --> 1:08:41.760
I can help you!

1:09:00.120 --> 1:09:02.720
Don't yell out, or I'll cut you.

1:09:04.240 --> 1:09:06.280
Istvan? No, I'm not Istvan.

1:09:06.280 --> 1:09:07.960
Now empty your pockets.

1:09:07.960 --> 1:09:09.480
Now, do it!Yes.

1:09:10.880 --> 1:09:12.520
And your coat.

1:09:12.520 --> 1:09:14.000
Give me your coat!Of course.

1:09:17.160 --> 1:09:20.440
Now, go. Get out! Out!

1:09:36.440 --> 1:09:38.120
Dear God, what happened?

1:09:38.120 --> 1:09:40.640
Oh, Max.Don't say anything,
please, it's fine.

1:09:40.640 --> 1:09:42.640
Where have you been?
What have you been doing?

1:09:42.640 --> 1:09:44.880
I was stupid.
I was in the park last night.

1:09:44.880 --> 1:09:48.120
In the park?
What on earth were you up to?

1:09:48.120 --> 1:09:50.520
Let me get some iodine for it.
Mama, please, don't...

1:09:50.520 --> 1:09:53.440
It looks awful. You can't see
patients looking like that.

1:09:53.440 --> 1:09:56.520
Well, I don't have any patients,
so that's a sort of blessing.

1:09:57.920 --> 1:10:00.720
I was robbed.

1:10:00.720 --> 1:10:03.520
Have you informed the police?
I don't want to. It's not important.

1:10:03.520 --> 1:10:05.080
Not important?!

1:10:05.080 --> 1:10:07.440
Sir, the police are at the door.

1:10:09.600 --> 1:10:11.240
Very prompt.

1:10:30.800 --> 1:10:32.640
An accident with a patient.

1:10:34.560 --> 1:10:36.560
You're a lousy liar.

1:10:52.720 --> 1:10:54.240
Your coat.

1:10:56.120 --> 1:10:59.160
Your wallet, your hat.

1:11:02.680 --> 1:11:06.560
I was assaulted. Here. Last night.

1:11:06.560 --> 1:11:08.160
By this charming fellow?

1:11:10.120 --> 1:11:13.000
And then, he was attacked
immediately after,

1:11:13.000 --> 1:11:15.560
wearing your clothes.

1:11:15.560 --> 1:11:17.440
Max, why didn't you tell me?

1:11:17.440 --> 1:11:22.400
Because...
I knew you wouldn't have approved.

1:11:22.400 --> 1:11:24.880
I thought I could get him
to confess.

1:11:24.880 --> 1:11:28.000
And I made a mistake,
Oskar, I'm sorry.

1:11:29.600 --> 1:11:31.560
But he's here.

1:11:31.560 --> 1:11:33.760
Istvan, he's still in Vienna.

1:11:33.760 --> 1:11:35.360
He's trying to make contact.

1:11:35.360 --> 1:11:38.920
Yes, with a knife in your guts.

1:11:38.920 --> 1:11:41.000
He may have just tried
to defend himself.

1:11:51.000 --> 1:11:54.280
I have to meet him.
I have to reach him somehow.

1:11:54.280 --> 1:11:56.600
That's insane.
This could have been you.

1:11:56.600 --> 1:11:59.160
He's trying to get close to me.

1:11:59.160 --> 1:12:00.760
I can help you catch him.

1:12:04.480 --> 1:12:06.360
I'm sorry.

1:12:06.360 --> 1:12:08.920
I'm not prepared to gamble
with your life any more.

1:12:12.840 --> 1:12:15.240
He is here somewhere.

1:12:15.240 --> 1:12:17.040
Hiding in plain sight.

1:12:20.120 --> 1:12:22.080
She knew she was dying.

1:12:24.600 --> 1:12:28.240
She knew he'd managed
to get to her somehow.

1:12:28.240 --> 1:12:31.120
Instinctively she grabbed
at her jewels, but...

1:12:31.120 --> 1:12:33.600
SOBBING ECHOES

1:12:33.600 --> 1:12:35.320
..they were worthless to her now.

1:12:36.720 --> 1:12:38.160
KNOCK ON DOOR

1:12:38.160 --> 1:12:39.720
Yes?

1:12:39.720 --> 1:12:41.920
I've brought you coffee, gentlemen.

1:12:41.920 --> 1:12:44.120
Just put it there, er...

1:12:44.120 --> 1:12:46.080
Yannick, sir. Yannick.

1:12:48.160 --> 1:12:50.640
What's your surname?

1:12:50.640 --> 1:12:52.120
Neubauer, sir.

1:12:53.560 --> 1:12:56.560
ECHOING: Yannick, sir. Neubauer.

1:13:00.640 --> 1:13:03.800
I've met him.

1:13:03.800 --> 1:13:06.000
Oskar, I was face-to-face with him.

1:13:07.720 --> 1:13:11.200
He came to my office, I told you,
the one who brought the jewellery.

1:13:11.200 --> 1:13:14.440
What?He spun me a story
just to gain access.

1:13:16.000 --> 1:13:18.800
And then, later, he came back
and turned the place over.

1:13:23.160 --> 1:13:26.080
He's done what he came here to do.

1:13:26.080 --> 1:13:28.800
He could be 100 miles away
by now, we'll never find him.

1:13:30.520 --> 1:13:31.560
No.

1:13:33.080 --> 1:13:34.200
There's another way.

1:13:36.480 --> 1:13:38.120
Fraulein?

1:13:41.440 --> 1:13:43.120
Fraulein? Wait!

1:13:45.200 --> 1:13:48.640
The doctor - paid to remove all the
records, would you recognise him?

1:13:50.560 --> 1:13:52.280
Try to remember his name, please.

1:14:02.400 --> 1:14:05.560
Liebermann,
what the hell are you doing?

1:14:05.560 --> 1:14:08.080
You've been here a long time,
Professor.

1:14:08.080 --> 1:14:09.680
What business is that of yours?

1:14:09.680 --> 1:14:13.080
And who is this?
Can you recall a patient?

1:14:13.080 --> 1:14:15.840
What's this about, exactly?A boy.

1:14:15.840 --> 1:14:18.200
Istvan Nadazdy.

1:14:18.200 --> 1:14:20.760
We have a witness who says that
you were his doctor,

1:14:20.760 --> 1:14:24.080
that you were paid to keep
his crimes from coming out.

1:14:24.080 --> 1:14:27.520
What?You were paid to
alter all his files.

1:14:27.520 --> 1:14:29.040
Don't be ridiculous. Get out.

1:14:29.040 --> 1:14:31.560
The family paid you
to keep it from coming to light.

1:14:31.560 --> 1:14:33.800
You were just a junior physician,
of course.

1:14:33.800 --> 1:14:36.440
But there's a witness to your crime.

1:14:36.440 --> 1:14:38.680
I don't answer to you, Liebermann.

1:14:40.920 --> 1:14:42.680
This is a police enquiry.

1:14:44.400 --> 1:14:46.880
So, sit down in that chair.

1:14:50.120 --> 1:14:52.080
You are going to tell us everything,

1:14:52.080 --> 1:14:54.960
or I'll arrest you for obstruction.
You hear me?

1:15:03.280 --> 1:15:05.680
All the years I've worked here...

1:15:07.040 --> 1:15:09.160
..I've never seen anything like it.

1:15:11.120 --> 1:15:12.720
What do you remember about him?

1:15:15.120 --> 1:15:16.600
He never said much.

1:15:18.280 --> 1:15:20.760
But...his eyes.

1:15:23.840 --> 1:15:26.880
You could tell at once,
he had a deeply disturbed mind.

1:15:29.720 --> 1:15:32.960
I don't know how he got hold of it.

1:15:32.960 --> 1:15:34.640
What?

1:15:34.640 --> 1:15:36.880
A knife.

1:15:36.880 --> 1:15:39.200
Must've kept it from his dinner.

1:15:39.200 --> 1:15:42.440
One of the older boys,
one who kept on teasing him,

1:15:42.440 --> 1:15:47.680
he...he attacked him.

1:15:47.680 --> 1:15:50.000
He left when he was 16 years old.

1:15:50.000 --> 1:15:51.720
He was taken to another hospital.

1:15:53.440 --> 1:15:56.920
I don't know what happened
to him after that.

1:15:56.920 --> 1:15:58.960
I never saw him again.

1:15:58.960 --> 1:16:00.720
Where was he kept when he was here?

1:16:02.320 --> 1:16:04.240
I need to see the place.

1:16:04.240 --> 1:16:06.520
The children's wing.

1:16:06.520 --> 1:16:09.240
It closed down
long before your time.

1:16:09.240 --> 1:16:10.880
The building's still standing.

1:17:21.880 --> 1:17:23.320
Istvan?

1:17:24.880 --> 1:17:26.560
I'm not Istvan.

1:17:27.800 --> 1:17:29.280
Istvan is dead.

1:17:31.720 --> 1:17:33.360
They killed him.

1:17:36.080 --> 1:17:37.680
Tell me everything.

1:17:39.280 --> 1:17:41.520
I want to listen,
I want to understand.

1:17:46.400 --> 1:17:48.680
Hm.

1:17:48.680 --> 1:17:51.040
They brought you here. Mm-hm.

1:17:53.080 --> 1:17:55.520
You know she gave me up?

1:17:55.520 --> 1:17:56.560
KNIFE SWISHES

1:17:58.000 --> 1:17:59.680
Her own son.

1:18:09.600 --> 1:18:11.600
I don't think you want to hurt me.

1:18:14.600 --> 1:18:17.200
I don't think you wanted
to hurt that man in the park.

1:18:21.640 --> 1:18:23.440
Why couldn't she love me?

1:18:25.960 --> 1:18:28.120
Because you hurt that
little girl, Blanka...

1:18:28.120 --> 1:18:30.120
I didn't mean it!

1:18:32.040 --> 1:18:36.480
Well, it all has to stop now,

1:18:36.480 --> 1:18:38.440
now your mother's dead and gone.

1:18:43.960 --> 1:18:45.720
I didn't kill her.

1:18:47.360 --> 1:18:51.160
What? I wanted to.

1:18:51.160 --> 1:18:54.080
I thought about it, every day.

1:18:55.720 --> 1:18:58.920
I wanted to hurt her so badly.

1:18:58.920 --> 1:19:00.440
Then what happened?

1:19:03.440 --> 1:19:06.040
I came to find her when I escaped.

1:19:07.960 --> 1:19:10.680
Got as close to her as I could.

1:19:12.320 --> 1:19:16.720
I got into the hotel,
stole a valet's uniform.

1:19:16.720 --> 1:19:20.400
And I watched her with that man.

1:19:22.000 --> 1:19:25.720
Laughing, smiling.

1:19:27.160 --> 1:19:29.040
Young enough to be her son.

1:19:33.160 --> 1:19:35.880
I just wanted to be with her.

1:19:37.320 --> 1:19:40.520
I wanted her to have her arms
around me, instead of him.

1:19:42.800 --> 1:19:45.280
She wanted your forgiveness
more than anything.

1:19:49.320 --> 1:19:53.000
Istvan, I can help you.

1:19:55.440 --> 1:19:57.520
Come with me.

1:19:57.520 --> 1:19:58.560
Ah!

1:20:04.960 --> 1:20:06.600
No, don't shoot.

1:20:06.600 --> 1:20:07.960
Ah!

1:20:14.520 --> 1:20:16.200
HE WINCES

1:20:18.920 --> 1:20:21.720
I'm saving your backside again.

1:20:21.720 --> 1:20:24.960
Just like old times. Come on.

1:20:29.400 --> 1:20:30.920
He's not our killer.

1:20:32.400 --> 1:20:34.800
Not our killer?No.

1:20:34.800 --> 1:20:37.240
That's insane.
Have you lost your mind?

1:20:37.240 --> 1:20:39.720
He's just a child who craves
what we all crave -

1:20:39.720 --> 1:20:41.400
acceptance from a parent.

1:20:42.640 --> 1:20:45.240
That reunion could never have
taken place if she was dead.

1:20:45.240 --> 1:20:46.920
Thank you.

1:20:46.920 --> 1:20:50.600
He has a complex personality
disorder, he's disturbed...

1:20:50.600 --> 1:20:52.000
But no, he's not our killer.

1:20:53.120 --> 1:20:55.880
I thought we were so close.

1:20:55.880 --> 1:20:57.720
Your hat.Thank you.

1:20:57.720 --> 1:20:59.080
I need a drink.

1:21:02.520 --> 1:21:05.480
A Slivovitz for me, and house wine
for my friend. Thank you.

1:21:16.680 --> 1:21:20.480
No suspects. No clues.
No leads. No witnesses.

1:21:23.720 --> 1:21:26.920
Von Bulow has been hoping
to kick me off the case.

1:21:26.920 --> 1:21:30.120
This has just given him
the opportunity he wanted.

1:21:30.120 --> 1:21:32.480
I'm sorry, Oskar... No.

1:21:32.480 --> 1:21:34.280
It isn't you.

1:21:34.280 --> 1:21:37.480
I was so convinced that it was
Hauke I forgot to do my job.

1:21:38.520 --> 1:21:41.280
And now, the trail has gone cold.

1:21:43.800 --> 1:21:45.760
I'm sorry sir. It's all right.

1:21:52.440 --> 1:21:54.960
How many tables? How many places?

1:21:58.000 --> 1:21:59.760
What? What do you mean? Why?

1:22:01.320 --> 1:22:04.720
If we went outside right now
and the drinks arrived,

1:22:04.720 --> 1:22:07.600
how would the waiter know which
place was yours and which was mine?

1:22:07.600 --> 1:22:10.200
You're talking in riddles, Max.
It's getting tiresome.

1:22:10.200 --> 1:22:11.240
No, no, listen.

1:22:11.240 --> 1:22:13.400
If we got up for a moment
and we stepped outside,

1:22:13.400 --> 1:22:16.800
how would he know for certain
that this was your chair?

1:22:18.160 --> 1:22:20.160
I don't know.

1:22:20.160 --> 1:22:24.240
He would look for my...
coat, I suppose.

1:22:26.240 --> 1:22:28.040
Remember what Holler told us?

1:22:30.040 --> 1:22:32.080
They got up to dance.

1:22:32.080 --> 1:22:34.200
Now, I'm the Countess, you're Hauke.

1:22:34.200 --> 1:22:36.240
Yes, obviously.

1:22:36.240 --> 1:22:40.120
Then Holler said that while
they were gone, her shawl,

1:22:40.120 --> 1:22:42.440
it fell to the floor. Yeah.

1:22:42.440 --> 1:22:45.800
Now, Holler, he picked it up.

1:22:47.560 --> 1:22:52.880
But what if he placed it on
Hauke's chair, instead of hers?

1:22:54.800 --> 1:22:59.320
And the person
bringing the poison...

1:23:01.120 --> 1:23:02.760
..put it there?

1:23:08.600 --> 1:23:11.160
We may have been wrong
this whole time.

1:23:11.160 --> 1:23:14.600
What if he...
was the intended victim?

1:23:51.200 --> 1:23:54.160
We might have been looking in
the wrong place all this time.

1:23:57.040 --> 1:24:00.080
Sir. Scandal in the regiment.

1:24:00.080 --> 1:24:02.760
The Uhlans. Exact same platoon.

1:24:02.760 --> 1:24:04.960
And the dates match. Look.

1:24:07.360 --> 1:24:12.000
Young man, an Uhlan,
who hanged himself.

1:24:12.000 --> 1:24:14.160
Found in bed with another soldier.

1:24:15.400 --> 1:24:17.240
An officer.

1:24:17.240 --> 1:24:20.080
It says the officer seduced him.

1:24:20.080 --> 1:24:22.400
He was immediately discharged.

1:24:22.400 --> 1:24:25.560
There's no names.
The scandal was hushed up.

1:24:25.560 --> 1:24:27.480
Hauke.

1:24:27.480 --> 1:24:32.080
His relationship with the Countess,
protection from wagging tongues.

1:24:33.400 --> 1:24:35.600
God.

1:24:35.600 --> 1:24:37.800
Oskar?

1:24:37.800 --> 1:24:39.080
Thank you.

1:24:50.360 --> 1:24:51.840
My beauty.

1:25:15.880 --> 1:25:18.680
Haussmann found evidence,
I was stupid.

1:25:18.680 --> 1:25:21.640
I ignored it.What evidence?

1:25:21.640 --> 1:25:23.280
The staff quarters in the hotel.

1:25:23.280 --> 1:25:26.560
Bodies being sold like room service.

1:25:26.560 --> 1:25:28.920
That's the reason why
Hauke went there.

1:25:30.240 --> 1:25:32.520
Still, who would want to kill him?

1:25:34.200 --> 1:25:36.960
We've met the killer, Oskar.

1:25:36.960 --> 1:25:38.960
We stared right in her face.

1:26:14.200 --> 1:26:17.080
WHIP CRACKS

1:26:19.280 --> 1:26:21.640
DISTANT WHIP CRACKS

1:26:37.080 --> 1:26:39.360
So, the poison was meant for me?

1:26:52.160 --> 1:26:53.640
Gentlemen.

1:26:57.120 --> 1:27:00.120
He was your son, the young Uhlan.

1:27:02.120 --> 1:27:05.320
This animal seduced him.

1:27:06.640 --> 1:27:09.520
My boy couldn't bear the scandal.

1:27:09.520 --> 1:27:11.080
Hanged himself.

1:27:12.880 --> 1:27:16.240
Frau Reiss, please, put it down.

1:27:17.760 --> 1:27:19.720
You don't understand.

1:27:22.040 --> 1:27:23.960
We loved each other.

1:27:38.200 --> 1:27:40.120
GUN COCKS

1:27:40.120 --> 1:27:41.440
Gentlemen.

1:28:01.040 --> 1:28:02.760
Hauke was no villain.

1:28:04.640 --> 1:28:07.400
He was lost and alone.

1:28:09.120 --> 1:28:11.680
Forced to live a life of lies.

1:28:12.800 --> 1:28:15.040
Evil with a woman's face?

1:28:18.720 --> 1:28:21.040
There's no evil here, Max.

1:28:36.360 --> 1:28:40.560
They've asked you to be a witness
at my disciplinary hearing?

1:28:42.920 --> 1:28:44.800
Ironic.

1:28:44.800 --> 1:28:47.400
What a moment of victory for you,
Liebermann.

1:28:48.760 --> 1:28:51.120
You wait.

1:28:51.120 --> 1:28:52.800
My time will come.

1:29:00.200 --> 1:29:02.760
There is no greater need for
a child than the love

1:29:02.760 --> 1:29:04.160
and acceptance of a parent.

1:29:05.400 --> 1:29:08.640
Perhaps that child is
still inside us all,

1:29:08.640 --> 1:29:10.440
still craving their approval.

1:29:12.080 --> 1:29:14.680
The love of a parent
can be powerful,

1:29:14.680 --> 1:29:16.440
sometimes all-consuming.

1:29:17.640 --> 1:29:21.840
Some parents will sacrifice
anything for their child,

1:29:21.840 --> 1:29:23.200
even themselves.
