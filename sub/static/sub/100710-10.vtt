WEBVTT

00:01.436 --> 00:02.132
- Previously,
on "The Flash"...

00:02.176 --> 00:04.308
- Vibe must live again.

00:04.352 --> 00:06.876
- I am no longer Nash.
I am Pariah.

00:06.919 --> 00:08.225
I freed The Anti-Monitor.

00:08.269 --> 00:10.097
Now I am forced
to bear witness

00:10.140 --> 00:12.360
as he destroys
world after world.

00:12.403 --> 00:14.188
- Oliver scarified himself
to create this new world.

00:14.231 --> 00:15.798
- Our Earths must have merged

00:15.841 --> 00:17.408
when we helped Oliver
reboot the Universe.

00:17.452 --> 00:19.323
We all live
on the same Earth now.

00:19.367 --> 00:20.759
- This is the same guy
that kidnapped

00:20.803 --> 00:22.022
your cousin Esperanza

00:22.065 --> 00:23.545
and turned her
into a meta-assassin.

00:23.588 --> 00:25.634
- The guy you questioned
was killed in the same lot

00:25.677 --> 00:27.331
you questioned him,
on the same day.

00:27.375 --> 00:29.551
- There's major UV energy
coming off this thing.

00:29.594 --> 00:32.554
- Looks like Team Citizen
has a new mission.

00:35.687 --> 00:36.775
- Come on in, folks.

00:36.819 --> 00:39.082
After five months
of Vibaccinos to-go,

00:39.126 --> 00:40.214
welcome to the new Jitters.

00:40.257 --> 00:42.694
Here you go.

00:42.738 --> 00:44.087
And remember, folks,

00:44.131 --> 00:46.350
CC Jitters is here to stay,
rain or--

00:46.394 --> 00:49.005
- Hands in the air,
you foam-loving fascists!

00:49.049 --> 00:51.355
- Are you kidding me?
We're already being robbed?

00:51.399 --> 00:52.791
- Jitters just reopened

00:52.835 --> 00:55.185
and was immediately attacked
by terrorists.

00:55.229 --> 00:56.534
Why am I not surprised?

00:56.578 --> 00:58.319
- I'll go bail out
those latte-sippers.

00:58.362 --> 01:00.886
- Guys, I got this.

01:05.152 --> 01:07.676
- You.
Open the register.

01:07.719 --> 01:08.894
Give me everything inside.

01:08.938 --> 01:11.114
- Dude, we just reopened.

01:11.158 --> 01:12.202
There's barely anything
in there.

01:14.117 --> 01:16.163
- Really?
- Yeah.

01:16.206 --> 01:18.121
- Oh.

01:19.775 --> 01:23.866
Well, I'm gonna start
blowing stuff up then.

01:43.103 --> 01:45.670
- Oh, crap.

01:48.369 --> 01:50.501
- Sorry I'm late.

01:50.545 --> 01:52.068
I love what you've done
with the place.

01:54.114 --> 01:56.420
Flash! Flash!

01:56.464 --> 02:00.859
- Oh, stop.
Stop it, guys.

02:17.006 --> 02:18.181
- I'm sorry.

02:18.225 --> 02:20.662
Crisis is over,
we beat the bad guy,

02:20.705 --> 02:23.621
and you're still worried
because...

02:23.665 --> 02:25.014
- Because...

02:25.057 --> 02:27.103
an infinite number of Earths

02:27.147 --> 02:29.453
experienced a cosmic heat death

02:29.497 --> 02:34.502
from which only one Earth
was rebuilt.

02:34.545 --> 02:35.677
- Mm-hmm.

02:35.720 --> 02:40.464
- So now not only
do Superman, Supergirl,

02:40.508 --> 02:42.379
and Black Lightning live here,

02:42.423 --> 02:46.601
but now our entire timeline
has been rewritten

02:46.644 --> 02:48.429
so that they've always
lived here,

02:48.472 --> 02:50.822
and I don't remember
owning this shirt.

02:51.910 --> 02:53.347
- Great shirt.

02:53.390 --> 02:54.652
Besides, isn't that
a good thing?

02:54.696 --> 02:56.828
We're all one big,
happy family now?

02:56.872 --> 02:59.222
- No. No!

02:59.266 --> 03:01.224
No, it is not.

03:01.268 --> 03:04.488
Not when these guys
are crashing the reunion.

03:04.532 --> 03:06.490
Not a single one
of our doppelgangers

03:06.534 --> 03:08.840
survived to make it
to Earth Prime,

03:08.884 --> 03:10.190
as far as I can tell,

03:10.233 --> 03:11.974
but we did manage to pick up

03:12.017 --> 03:16.413
a butt-ton of bad guys
and aliens and more metas,

03:16.457 --> 03:17.849
and you know the best part?

03:18.894 --> 03:20.200
The best part

03:20.243 --> 03:22.550
is a bunch of our old villains
are back,

03:22.593 --> 03:24.813
with fresh paint jobs!

03:24.856 --> 03:27.207
- When did you have time
to do all this?

03:27.250 --> 03:31.907
- Edencorp, The Top,
Rainbow Raider.

03:31.950 --> 03:34.692
Our Earth has more threats
than ever,

03:34.736 --> 03:36.346
and we don't even know
where they're coming from.

03:38.261 --> 03:40.350
- What the hell was that?

03:40.394 --> 03:42.526
- Pipes--bad pipes.
The heating.

03:42.570 --> 03:44.441
Don't worry about it.

03:44.485 --> 03:46.704
- Let me out.
- Are you sure?

03:46.748 --> 03:49.620
Cause it looks like
you locked Nash in the closet.

03:49.664 --> 03:50.969
- No.

03:51.013 --> 03:53.537
- Let me out.

03:53.581 --> 03:56.540
- Okay, one of the auxiliary
pipes was leaking,

03:56.584 --> 03:58.368
so he's patching it up

03:58.412 --> 04:00.065
in exchange
for a Crypto-circuit.

04:00.109 --> 04:01.589
- Fine, don't let me out.

04:01.632 --> 04:04.287
I'll let myself out, actually,
thank you very much.

04:04.331 --> 04:06.289
I'm gonna put an Atlantean
shoulder check

04:06.333 --> 04:08.813
into this door
and bust right through.

04:08.857 --> 04:11.686
In three, in two...
- Okay.

04:11.729 --> 04:12.687
- In one!

04:17.909 --> 04:19.084
- Sup?

04:21.913 --> 04:24.264
Killer Frost.
- It's just Frost now.

04:24.307 --> 04:25.569
- Give me my Crypto-circuit

04:25.613 --> 04:27.136
or I'm gonna punch you
in the throat.

04:27.179 --> 04:29.791
- I have your Crypto-circuit,
and I could give it to you,

04:29.834 --> 04:31.662
but, you know,

04:31.706 --> 04:34.099
I'm not really sure
what you'd need it for,

04:34.143 --> 04:36.406
because you're an adventurer,

04:36.450 --> 04:39.104
so shouldn't you be off
somewhere, adventuring?

04:39.148 --> 04:41.193
Preferably not here.

04:41.237 --> 04:43.413
- Yeah, I mean, Gorilla City's
part of Earth Prime now.

04:43.457 --> 04:45.110
Don't you wanna go mythbust it?

04:45.154 --> 04:46.460
- No.

04:46.503 --> 04:47.722
Gorillas are atheists.

04:47.765 --> 04:49.289
Are you kidding me?

04:49.332 --> 04:52.030
No, I'm gonna run tests
on my dig site

04:52.074 --> 04:54.032
to insure that nobody ever

04:54.076 --> 04:56.818
accidentally reopens
the anti-matter universe.

04:58.994 --> 05:00.125
- Run your tests,

05:00.169 --> 05:01.344
but I've already run tests,

05:01.388 --> 05:03.607
and that cave is staying shut,

05:03.651 --> 05:05.130
so you're not really
needed here.

05:05.174 --> 05:07.785
- Oh, you ran the tests?
Then I'm really needed.

05:09.047 --> 05:10.266
- What happened to Magenta?

05:10.310 --> 05:12.486
I liked her.

05:14.923 --> 05:16.141
- Isn't it great?

05:16.185 --> 05:17.969
It's still our
number one story.

05:19.406 --> 05:21.973
Thanks again, friend.

05:22.017 --> 05:24.062
- Iris. Hey.
- Hi.

05:24.106 --> 05:26.804
- I was running back
from a car fire on Route 119,

05:26.848 --> 05:29.241
and look who I found
on the way back.

05:29.285 --> 05:30.982
- Hey.
- Dig, hey.

05:31.026 --> 05:33.202
How's the fam?

05:33.245 --> 05:35.552
- Oh, everyone is very busy.

05:35.596 --> 05:37.946
Lila just accepted
a new posting,

05:37.989 --> 05:40.427
so next week we'll be taking
the kids to Metropolis.

05:40.470 --> 05:41.515
- I heard.

05:41.558 --> 05:42.820
So shouldn't you be at home,

05:42.864 --> 05:44.866
helping to pack boxes
right now?

05:44.909 --> 05:46.955
- Right.

05:46.998 --> 05:48.043
But...

05:50.611 --> 05:52.134
Oliver's last will
and testament

05:52.177 --> 05:53.396
was read yesterday,

05:53.440 --> 05:54.702
and, um,

05:54.745 --> 05:57.835
he left something for you,
Barry.

05:59.446 --> 06:01.186
- Oliver's mask.

06:01.230 --> 06:03.841
- It's the original.

06:06.322 --> 06:08.672
This is the one I made him.

06:08.716 --> 06:10.108
- Yeah, it's interesting,

06:10.152 --> 06:13.068
because Oliver was never
a man given to sentiment.

06:14.504 --> 06:17.289
- Hey, do you see this?

06:17.333 --> 06:18.943
Right above the left eye.

06:20.075 --> 06:21.468
Oliver hasn't worn this
in years.

06:21.511 --> 06:22.860
Why is there a mark on it?

06:22.904 --> 06:23.905
- I don't know.

06:23.948 --> 06:25.515
Felicity skimped
on the dry-cleaning?

06:25.559 --> 06:26.864
- Or he left it on purpose.

06:26.908 --> 06:29.040
I mean, you just said it.
Oliver wasn't sappy.

06:29.084 --> 06:31.521
What if the mask is a clue
to some new threat out there,

06:31.565 --> 06:33.871
something too dangerous
to put in writing?

06:33.915 --> 06:35.656
- Barry, you got all that
from a smudge mark?

06:35.699 --> 06:36.744
I don't, uh...
- I...

06:36.787 --> 06:38.354
- Iris, what do you think?

06:38.398 --> 06:39.573
- Um, that you two

06:39.616 --> 06:40.617
will have to figure this out
on your own.

06:40.661 --> 06:41.879
I'm so sorry, babe, I gotta go

06:41.923 --> 06:43.315
meet with this source,
like, right now.

06:43.359 --> 06:44.447
- Yeah, no, that's fine.

06:44.491 --> 06:46.014
Do your thing.

06:46.057 --> 06:48.233
Break your story,
and Dig and I can work on this.

06:48.277 --> 06:50.061
- We--we can?

06:50.105 --> 06:51.193
- Can we?

07:06.251 --> 07:08.253
- Were you followed?

07:08.297 --> 07:10.517
- No.
- You sure?

07:10.560 --> 07:11.779
- Yes.

07:11.822 --> 07:13.868
- Uh, no--no--no recordings.

07:13.911 --> 07:16.087
The people you're after,
they know my voice.

07:17.437 --> 07:19.134
- These people--
you say you've learned

07:19.177 --> 07:22.442
quite a bit about them, so you
should recognize this, right?

07:24.313 --> 07:27.098
I spent 20 years working
for McCulloch Technologies.

07:27.142 --> 07:30.624
R&D department,
classified division.

07:30.667 --> 07:32.452
And then this guy showed up,

07:32.495 --> 07:34.062
said his name was
Malcolm Strombard.

07:34.105 --> 07:35.672
He'd been promoted
into our group,

07:35.716 --> 07:38.762
but he had no technical
know-how.

07:38.806 --> 07:41.069
But last fall, I--
I came in late one night,

07:41.112 --> 07:45.595
and I--I found him
with the infrared photon rifle

07:45.639 --> 07:47.554
we'd been developing
for years.

07:47.597 --> 07:49.599
The next day,

07:49.643 --> 07:51.471
he and the prototype
were gone.

07:51.514 --> 07:52.776
So I started looking into it,

07:52.820 --> 07:55.257
and this man,
Malcolm Strombard,

07:55.300 --> 07:57.259
he doesn't officially exist.

07:57.302 --> 07:59.304
Of course, no one
at McCulloch believed me,

07:59.348 --> 08:01.481
so they fired me.

08:01.524 --> 08:05.223
- The group that sent him
to steal that rifle,

08:05.267 --> 08:07.443
they found out I was after him.

08:12.709 --> 08:14.276
- Oh, they killed
their own man.

08:14.319 --> 08:16.713
- They have destroyed
way too many innocent lives,

08:16.757 --> 08:18.672
and they will not stop

08:18.715 --> 08:21.022
unless someone helps us
bring them to light.

08:22.632 --> 08:25.156
Someone like you, Mr. Huskk.

08:26.984 --> 08:28.508
- And I can stay anonymous?

08:28.551 --> 08:30.727
- No one will ever know
your identity.

08:30.771 --> 08:34.557
I will do whatever it takes
to keep you safe, I swear.

08:35.471 --> 08:36.733
- These people--they will not

08:36.777 --> 08:38.692
be brought
out of the shadows easily.

08:40.041 --> 08:42.696
They live in the darkness.

08:42.739 --> 08:45.176
In the absence of light.

08:50.660 --> 08:52.357
- I didn't talk.

08:52.401 --> 08:53.968
I didn't talk, I swear!

08:54.011 --> 08:56.057
- They call themselves...

08:59.408 --> 09:01.192
- Black Hole.

09:19.080 --> 09:20.951
- You're telling me
that a secret organization

09:20.995 --> 09:22.562
has been operating
in Central City

09:22.605 --> 09:24.128
for seven years now?

09:24.172 --> 09:26.478
- Yes, and according
to my source,

09:26.522 --> 09:28.219
they have a name.

09:28.263 --> 09:29.656
Black Hole.

09:29.699 --> 09:31.222
- We've been building
a timeline.

09:31.266 --> 09:33.007
It looks like Black Hole's
activity started

09:33.050 --> 09:35.270
just after the Particle
Accelerator exploded.

09:35.313 --> 09:37.359
- They've been abducting
and training meta-humans,

09:37.402 --> 09:39.883
like my cousin Esperanza
and potentially others.

09:39.927 --> 09:41.624
- And Black Hole's reach
goes far beyond

09:41.668 --> 09:43.234
theft and training
meta-human assassins.

09:43.278 --> 09:45.454
They are also involved
in international arms deals.

09:45.497 --> 09:48.631
- And they kill anyone they
believe has been compromised,

09:48.675 --> 09:50.067
including our mystery man,

09:50.111 --> 09:51.678
who's now crispier than
the chicken strips

09:51.721 --> 09:53.636
Allegra insists
on ordering for dinner.

09:53.680 --> 09:55.072
- Better than
your vegan donuts.

09:55.116 --> 09:57.422
-  Iris,
have you told Joe about this?

09:57.466 --> 09:59.250
- Yeah, I have,
but Dad would have to launch

09:59.294 --> 10:02.471
a RICO investigation to pursue
a conspiracy like this.

10:02.514 --> 10:04.865
This is reporter territory now.

10:04.908 --> 10:08.651
- Okay, okay, look.
Guys, I get it.

10:08.695 --> 10:11.132
There's nothing stronger
than a reporter's drive.

10:11.175 --> 10:14.352
I--I literally can feel it
coming from all three of you.

10:14.396 --> 10:19.270
But as your legal advisor,
I gotta tell you...

10:19.314 --> 10:21.751
I think that running
this story is a mistake.

10:21.795 --> 10:23.448
Iris, if McCulloch
doesn't like what they read,

10:23.492 --> 10:25.450
they can sue you
for defamation.

10:25.494 --> 10:26.756
- I know. My dad was worried

10:26.800 --> 10:27.931
about the same thing,
but that's a risk

10:27.975 --> 10:29.498
that I'm willing to take,
Cecille.

10:29.541 --> 10:32.632
- Guys, we don't even know
who's running Black Hole.

10:32.675 --> 10:33.807
- We're gonna find out.

10:33.850 --> 10:35.330
- Yeah, she's right.

10:35.373 --> 10:37.549
Reporters don't walk away
from the truth.

10:37.593 --> 10:40.204
Now, I have a meeting

10:40.248 --> 10:42.685
with the CEO
of McCulloch Technologies,

10:42.729 --> 10:44.121
Joseph Carver, in an hour.

10:44.165 --> 10:45.732
So let's see if he's
willing to comment

10:45.775 --> 10:47.211
on what's been happening.

10:47.255 --> 10:50.867
But either way,
be prepared to go to print.

10:50.911 --> 10:54.436
We are running this story
with or without his comment.

11:09.016 --> 11:10.191
- I know it's sort of like

11:10.234 --> 11:11.801
asking the ocean
to be less wet,

11:11.845 --> 11:14.674
but Barry, do you think
you could, um, slow down?

11:14.717 --> 11:16.763
- Dig, you wouldn't let me
speed you to the crime lab,

11:16.806 --> 11:18.329
so I had to speed
the crime lab here.

11:19.635 --> 11:21.028
Look, man, if Oliver
really wanted you

11:21.071 --> 11:22.725
to look into something,
don't you think he would've

11:22.769 --> 11:25.467
left you a note
instead of some secret code?

11:25.510 --> 11:28.209
- Oh, because Oliver never
kept a secret from you before?

11:32.735 --> 11:34.302
There's sediment traces
on the mask

11:34.345 --> 11:37.000
usually found on islands
in the North China Sea.

11:37.044 --> 11:39.568
Like Lian Yu.
- Like Lian Yu--

11:39.611 --> 11:42.266
Barry, there's more than one
island in the North China Sea.

11:42.310 --> 11:47.315
- Yeah, but only one
with Mirakuru.

11:49.186 --> 11:50.710
- Does that mask really
have Mirakuru on it?

11:50.753 --> 11:53.451
- Anton Ivo's
super soldier serum.

11:53.495 --> 11:55.845
You really think there's any of
this stuff left on the island?

11:55.889 --> 11:57.368
- Yeah, well, Oliver
always thought that

11:57.412 --> 11:59.153
some samples could have
survived on Ivo's freighter.

11:59.196 --> 12:00.981
- And we don't even know
what the state of Lian Yu is

12:01.024 --> 12:03.026
post-Crisis; I mean,
if somebody got their hands

12:03.070 --> 12:04.767
on Mirakuru, they could become
a living weapon.

12:04.811 --> 12:07.204
Or replicate it and build
an entire army.

12:07.248 --> 12:10.555
I mean, Dig, this--this is--
this has got to be

12:10.599 --> 12:12.383
why Oliver left me the mask.

12:12.427 --> 12:14.385
He wants me to find
the last stash of Mirakuru

12:14.429 --> 12:16.387
on Lian Yu
before it threatens the world.

12:19.608 --> 12:21.566
Look, I know you don't want me
to run you there,

12:21.610 --> 12:24.569
but it's a 20-hour plane ride.

12:27.834 --> 12:29.879
That's too much.

12:31.925 --> 12:34.275
- What you got?

12:37.365 --> 12:38.714
- My wife and I
started this company

12:38.758 --> 12:40.498
with three employees.

12:40.542 --> 12:41.935
Now we have almost 3,000,

12:41.978 --> 12:44.024
but I still know
each one of their names.

12:44.067 --> 12:45.373
It's what Eva would've wanted.

12:45.416 --> 12:46.896
- That's very thoughtful,
Mr. Carver.

12:46.940 --> 12:48.115
- Joseph, please.

12:48.158 --> 12:49.638
I'm a huge fan
of "The Citizen."

12:49.681 --> 12:50.639
How can I help?

12:50.682 --> 12:51.901
- Well, I have a source

12:51.945 --> 12:53.250
who can prove that

12:53.294 --> 12:54.904
one of your classified
Photon Rifles

12:54.948 --> 12:57.472
was stolen last fall
and it's now in the hands

12:57.515 --> 12:59.126
of a secret organization

12:59.169 --> 13:02.956
linked to terrorism,
kidnapping, illegal arms deals,

13:02.999 --> 13:05.872
and murder.

13:07.438 --> 13:09.658
Would you care to comment?

13:10.485 --> 13:12.443
- Maurice, tell the board I'm
running a little bit behind.

13:12.487 --> 13:14.097
Ms. West-Allen and I
need to speak

13:14.141 --> 13:16.360
someplace a little more private

13:16.404 --> 13:17.622
- Great.

13:24.978 --> 13:27.632
- Your source--
it's Gene Huskk, isn't it?

13:27.676 --> 13:30.331
I completely respect your need
to protect your sources,

13:30.374 --> 13:31.941
but there's something
that you should see,

13:31.985 --> 13:33.943
off the record,
for Huskk's sake.

13:33.987 --> 13:36.032
Just a sec, please.

13:53.006 --> 13:54.790
Someone did infiltrate
the R&D division

13:54.834 --> 13:57.880
here at McCulloch, but it
wasn't a secret organization.

13:57.924 --> 14:00.840
It was Obsidian Tech trying
to steal one of our prototypes,

14:00.883 --> 14:03.843
but Huskk couldn't accept that.

14:03.886 --> 14:05.757
He became convinced

14:05.801 --> 14:07.934
there was some
larger conspiracy,

14:07.977 --> 14:10.414
and the paranoia consumed him.

14:10.458 --> 14:12.155
He became troubled,

14:12.199 --> 14:14.505
started scaring
other employees.

14:14.549 --> 14:16.246
I had no choice
but to let him go.

14:16.290 --> 14:17.639
- Mm.

14:17.682 --> 14:19.206
- But, uh, I can assure you

14:19.249 --> 14:21.861
that we have dealt
with this problem internally.

14:21.904 --> 14:24.167
We just completed
our investigation,

14:24.211 --> 14:26.169
and we're getting
a whole new security system

14:26.213 --> 14:29.346
starting tomorrow:
new badges, new cameras.

14:29.390 --> 14:31.174
The works.

14:31.218 --> 14:33.002
There's no story here.

14:33.046 --> 14:35.483
- Well, with all due respect,
Mr. Carver,

14:35.526 --> 14:36.876
I think that there is.

14:38.573 --> 14:41.402
Maybe it's just one
that you won't like.

14:42.925 --> 14:44.231
- Mm.

14:44.274 --> 14:46.102
Ms. West-Allen,
everything that I do,

14:46.146 --> 14:49.932
I do in my wife's honor,
to protect her legacy.

14:51.325 --> 14:53.109
A story like this
could really damage

14:53.153 --> 14:54.937
our company's reputation.

14:54.981 --> 14:56.939
Not to mention,
scare our investors.

14:56.983 --> 14:58.114
I'm asking you,

14:58.158 --> 14:59.899
please, don't run this story.

15:02.771 --> 15:04.381
- I understand.

15:04.425 --> 15:06.688
You have an obligation
to your shareholders.

15:06.731 --> 15:09.038
- Thank you.

15:09.082 --> 15:13.869
- But I have an obligation
to the truth.

15:13.913 --> 15:15.305
You were robbed, Mr. Carver,

15:15.349 --> 15:17.046
and I get that
that's embarrassing,

15:17.090 --> 15:19.614
but the public deserves
to know what happened

15:19.657 --> 15:22.008
before anyone else gets hurt,

15:22.051 --> 15:25.620
so if you wish
to withhold comment,

15:25.663 --> 15:28.579
that's fine...

15:30.016 --> 15:31.582
But I'm running this story
either way.

15:42.463 --> 15:45.422
- 100,000 views in one hour.
That's gotta be a record.

15:45.466 --> 15:47.947
- Citizen just fired
its first shots at Black Hole.

15:47.990 --> 15:49.774
- This is a cause
for celebration.

15:49.818 --> 15:51.602
- Ooh.
- Are you even 21?

15:54.257 --> 15:57.173
- I'd hold off
on the balloons and bubbly.

15:57.217 --> 15:59.045
McCulloch Tech
just sent a memo.

15:59.088 --> 16:02.265
They are suing "The Citizen"
for defamation.

16:11.187 --> 16:13.276
- This is ridiculous.
- Iris.

16:13.320 --> 16:14.756
- Fabricated statements,

16:14.799 --> 16:17.063
deliberate omission
of exonerating evidence--

16:17.106 --> 16:18.934
- Iris, something's not right.

16:21.676 --> 16:24.200
- Carver is just trying
to bury us in legal fees.

16:24.244 --> 16:26.028
He's just trying to scare us.

16:26.072 --> 16:27.203
- Everybody down!

16:45.221 --> 16:46.831
- Why is someone
shooting at us?

16:46.875 --> 16:48.050
- It's them. It's Black Hole.

16:48.094 --> 16:49.356
- Okay, we--we gotta go.

16:49.399 --> 16:50.661
- So they can kill us outside?

16:50.705 --> 16:52.141
- Okay, look,
it's me that they're after,

16:52.185 --> 16:53.534
okay, so you guys get
to S.T.A.R. Labs.

16:53.577 --> 16:55.144
I will make my way out
through Nash's tunnels.

16:55.188 --> 16:56.841
- No way.
We're not leaving you.

16:56.885 --> 16:59.670
- Look, I have to make sure
that my source is safe, okay?

16:59.714 --> 17:02.369
Once I do, I will
meet you there, I promise.

17:02.412 --> 17:05.328
Now we need to go.
On my count, okay?

17:05.372 --> 17:09.158
One, two, three.
Go!

17:16.905 --> 17:18.820
Go. Go, go, go, go, go.

17:33.095 --> 17:36.011
- You're okay. Oh.
What happened?

17:36.055 --> 17:37.882
- Black Hole tried
to assassinate Iris.

17:37.926 --> 17:40.320
She went to go find her source.
Cecille went to Joe's.

17:40.363 --> 17:41.799
- Where's Barry?
- He's in Lian Yu.

17:41.843 --> 17:43.105
I've been trying to radio him,

17:43.149 --> 17:44.498
but that place
is a total dead zone.

17:44.541 --> 17:46.239
- What about those
clicky things you guys use?

17:46.282 --> 17:47.979
- The extrapolators don't work.

17:48.023 --> 17:49.459
Now that the multi-verse
is gone,

17:49.503 --> 17:52.027
the physics behind breaching
has changed entirely.

17:52.071 --> 17:54.464
But don't worry, Frost is out
there looking for the shooter.

17:54.508 --> 17:57.206
- She should be careful.
Do you see these burn marks?

17:57.250 --> 18:01.080
Whoever tried to kill us
was using high-intensity light.

18:01.123 --> 18:03.386
- Holy crap.

18:03.430 --> 18:06.215
I'm glad you two
made it out alive.

18:06.259 --> 18:07.390
- Are you okay?

18:07.434 --> 18:09.436
- Yeah, I'm fine.
- You're fine.

18:09.479 --> 18:11.090
Good.

18:11.133 --> 18:14.310
Yeah, why didn't you tell me
that they were in danger?

18:14.354 --> 18:15.920
Okay, I could've--I could've
gotten them out of there.

18:15.964 --> 18:17.183
- Don't come at me, Nash.

18:17.226 --> 18:18.532
I'm not here
to keep you in the loop.

18:18.575 --> 18:19.750
You're not even
a part of this team.

18:19.794 --> 18:21.143
- Oh, that's so hurtful.

18:21.187 --> 18:22.579
How's your little team doing
in the standings?

18:22.623 --> 18:24.364
Your little team--
- Okay, you don't see

18:24.407 --> 18:25.713
this is exactly what I'm
talking about.

18:25.756 --> 18:27.541
No, you don't care
about the team.

18:27.584 --> 18:30.239
You only work with us when
you want something from us.

18:30.283 --> 18:32.415
- Yo, keep me out of this.

18:32.459 --> 18:33.503
- So what is it this time?

18:33.547 --> 18:35.026
You--you got a couple glyphs

18:35.070 --> 18:36.680
you need Allegra
to x-ray for you?

18:36.724 --> 18:38.160
Oh, or maybe you
just want to open up

18:38.204 --> 18:39.161
another Pandora's box
of Hell.

18:39.205 --> 18:40.510
- Are you kidding me?

18:40.554 --> 18:42.773
I was the one to--
I was the only one

18:42.817 --> 18:43.774
trying to stop Crisis.

18:43.818 --> 18:45.472
- A Crisis you started!

18:45.515 --> 18:48.605
Billions of worlds,
trillions of people gone,

18:48.649 --> 18:49.954
like they were never even born.

18:49.998 --> 18:51.782
- And I paid for it!

18:51.826 --> 18:55.134
As Pariah I paid for it
and still managed

18:55.177 --> 18:56.570
to help defeat
the Anti-Monitor.

18:56.613 --> 18:59.138
- Which did nothing
for the people who died.

19:02.184 --> 19:04.099
Oliver.

19:04.143 --> 19:06.145
Harry.

19:06.188 --> 19:08.147
Jesse.

19:09.713 --> 19:12.542
An infinite number
of Harrison Wells's.

19:13.978 --> 19:16.198
And we're stuck with the one
who killed the multi-verse.

19:29.516 --> 19:32.388
- Babe, what the frak was that?

19:34.782 --> 19:37.263
- Just making sure we learn
from our mistakes.

19:38.133 --> 19:39.656
Iris is still out there, guys,

19:39.700 --> 19:41.571
and we need to figure out
who this assassin is

19:41.615 --> 19:43.399
before they get to her first.

19:49.405 --> 19:50.450
- Thank God you're safe.

19:50.493 --> 19:52.234
- I'm not.
Neither are you.

19:52.278 --> 19:54.236
Black Hole isn't what we think.

19:56.543 --> 19:59.850
- Oh, my God.

19:59.894 --> 20:02.418
Mirror.

20:58.344 --> 20:59.780
- Iris.
- Boss, you're okay.

20:59.823 --> 21:01.521
- Yeah, no, I'm fine,
but my source isn't.

21:01.564 --> 21:04.437
The person that tried
to kill me got to him first.

21:04.480 --> 21:06.265
Hey, Cisco,
where's that binder?

21:06.308 --> 21:08.354
- Right here.
- Thanks.

21:09.442 --> 21:11.879
Where is it?
Where is she?

21:13.750 --> 21:16.318
Her.
Dr. Kimiyo Hoshi.

21:16.362 --> 21:18.277
- Hoshi...

21:18.320 --> 21:19.756
She went missing
four years ago.

21:19.800 --> 21:22.324
She's an astronomer
out of Tokyo

21:22.368 --> 21:24.108
with the power
to fuel starlight,

21:24.152 --> 21:26.241
but her meta-powers
aren't precise enough

21:26.285 --> 21:29.462
to do the kind of damage
you showed me in those photos.

21:29.505 --> 21:32.421
- What if she used
the Photon Rifle to focus them?

21:32.465 --> 21:34.945
- Good thinking,
maybe the reflector chip

21:34.989 --> 21:36.947
could condense
her UV photon emissions.

21:36.991 --> 21:38.340
- The rifle is the weapon.

21:38.384 --> 21:39.950
- No, she's the ammunition.

21:39.994 --> 21:41.343
- So Black Hole turned her
into some kind

21:41.387 --> 21:42.779
of evil light doctor.

21:42.823 --> 21:47.306
- So we've got a brand new,
more powerful,

21:47.349 --> 21:49.438
murder-happy Dr. Light
on our hands.

21:49.482 --> 21:51.266
Another new meta-surprise

21:51.310 --> 21:53.660
courtesy
of Earth-frakking-Prime.

21:53.703 --> 21:54.661
- Actually, you know what?

21:54.704 --> 21:56.227
Hoshi killed my source,

21:56.271 --> 21:58.969
but I managed to save some
evidence that he gave me.

21:59.013 --> 22:00.884
Ow.

22:06.325 --> 22:07.891
Damn it.

22:10.154 --> 22:11.852
- Hey, you should sit down.

22:11.895 --> 22:13.201
- I'm fine.

22:13.244 --> 22:15.464
- Did you get hurt out there?
- I said I'm fi--

22:15.508 --> 22:18.641
- Whoa, whoa.
Call Frost, now.

22:20.121 --> 22:22.471
- That was on the freighter?
- Yeah.

22:22.515 --> 22:24.647
If there's anything left,
it's in here.

22:24.691 --> 22:25.996
- Open it up, man,
let's see what's in it.

22:26.040 --> 22:27.389
- All right.

22:34.614 --> 22:36.006
- This can't be right.

22:36.050 --> 22:37.443
No, this can't be right.

22:37.486 --> 22:38.966
I--I--I searched
the whole island a dozen times.

22:39.009 --> 22:41.098
Take the win, man.

22:41.142 --> 22:42.752
There's no more
Mirakuru left, Barry.

22:42.796 --> 22:44.928
- No, I mean, Oliver's mask,
it's a warning.

22:44.972 --> 22:46.190
- Or...

22:46.713 --> 22:48.410
Maybe this is exactly
what it was intended

22:48.454 --> 22:50.586
to be in the first place:
a gift.

22:50.630 --> 22:54.198
- No, man, no, it can't--
it can't just be a gift.

22:54.242 --> 22:56.679
I mean, there's got to be
something we're missing.

22:56.723 --> 22:58.942
What if somebody
got to the Mirakuru first?

22:58.986 --> 23:00.683
- Really, and left
the box behind?

23:00.727 --> 23:01.858
I don't--

23:01.902 --> 23:03.425
Okay, I need to run more tests.

23:03.469 --> 23:05.035
Or why don't we
bring in the DEO?

23:05.079 --> 23:06.210
Or call Felicity or Thea,

23:06.254 --> 23:07.603
I mean, we--we can't just

23:07.647 --> 23:09.388
let somebody create
another Deathstroke.

23:09.431 --> 23:10.824
We have to stop
this threat, man.

23:10.867 --> 23:13.043
I mean, I have to finish
what Oliver started.

23:13.087 --> 23:14.131
- Barry!

23:15.568 --> 23:17.744
Are you all right, man?

23:18.527 --> 23:21.574
- Yeah, I'm--that's never...

23:22.401 --> 23:24.751
I--I--I'm just frustrated,
I guess.

23:24.794 --> 23:26.579
- Yeah.

23:28.102 --> 23:29.408
Yeah.

23:29.451 --> 23:31.584
Look, I think I know
exactly what went on here.

23:35.152 --> 23:37.546
Oliver and Thea came to this
island a couple of years ago,

23:37.590 --> 23:41.071
and they faced off with the man
who used to live in this cell.

23:41.115 --> 23:44.161
Deathstroke himself,
Slade Wilson.

23:44.771 --> 23:46.773
Oliver brought his uniform
with him.

23:48.557 --> 23:52.561
- Which is how he could have
soil and Mirakuru on his mask.

23:55.651 --> 23:57.566
It wasn't a warning at all.

24:00.482 --> 24:01.701
- You're searching
for a mission

24:01.744 --> 24:03.442
that doesn't exist, Barry.

24:04.007 --> 24:06.619
But no amount of searching
is gonna bring Oliver back.

24:14.714 --> 24:19.196
That man sprinted
from crusade to crusade.

24:20.763 --> 24:23.636
But, Barry, life is more
than just the mission,

24:23.679 --> 24:27.117
and unfortunately Oliver
learned that too late.

24:28.989 --> 24:31.382
And he wouldn't want you
going down that same path.

24:32.079 --> 24:34.342
- Oliver died so this Earth
could live, Dig.

24:34.385 --> 24:36.910
I have to do everything
I possibly can to protect it.

24:36.953 --> 24:41.480
- Oliver died for more
than this Earth's survival.

24:44.352 --> 24:46.789
Oliver laid down his life

24:46.833 --> 24:49.226
so the people he loved
could live theirs.

24:51.577 --> 24:53.187
That includes you.

24:58.584 --> 25:02.283
Life's a marathon,
not a sprint, Barry.

25:03.458 --> 25:05.547
Slow down and enjoy it.

25:14.687 --> 25:17.690
- So Kamilla asked me
to check on you.

25:18.255 --> 25:19.779
What are you watching?

25:24.958 --> 25:26.829
- So my latest experiment
jumpstarts my neurons...

25:26.873 --> 25:28.483
- Harry.

25:28.527 --> 25:29.832
- They're currently firing
at 120 times per second.

25:29.876 --> 25:31.355
And I think
we can get to 200.

25:31.399 --> 25:35.403
Yeah, so this is, you know,
progress.

25:35.446 --> 25:36.926
It's real progress.

25:36.970 --> 25:40.713
I'll let you know.
Anyway, miss you.

25:42.802 --> 25:44.847
- He was regaining
his intelligence.

25:46.632 --> 25:48.938
All of Earth-2.

25:48.982 --> 25:50.244
Wiped out.

25:52.855 --> 25:55.510
And he doesn't even know it.

25:55.554 --> 25:57.251
- But that wasn't your fault.

25:57.294 --> 25:58.948
- Wasn't it?

26:02.561 --> 26:05.215
When the Monitor gave me
my powers back,

26:05.259 --> 26:07.696
for Crisis,

26:07.740 --> 26:11.178
I remembered how powerful
I used to be.

26:12.222 --> 26:14.877
I can't help thinking that
if I hadn't stopped being Vibe,

26:14.921 --> 26:19.229
maybe I could have sensed
that first anti-matter wave.

26:21.623 --> 26:23.103
Maybe I could have saved them.

26:24.713 --> 26:26.367
- And that's why
you've become so obsessed

26:26.410 --> 26:27.760
with all the new threats.

26:29.370 --> 26:32.329
You want to protect everyone
who did survive on Earth Prime.

26:37.247 --> 26:40.033
Cisco, do you regret

26:40.076 --> 26:42.296
taking the meta-human cure?

26:42.339 --> 26:44.211
- No.

26:45.473 --> 26:46.648
- Do you miss being Vibe?

26:46.692 --> 26:48.389
- Caitlin,
it's not that simple.

26:59.356 --> 27:01.228
I don't know.

27:05.101 --> 27:06.625
I don't know.

27:11.891 --> 27:13.370
- You know...

27:14.154 --> 27:16.722
I think you might be
onto something over here.

27:19.507 --> 27:24.425
With all these new threats,

27:24.468 --> 27:27.384
changes to our reality,

27:27.428 --> 27:30.953
we need someone whose job
it is to compile all of them.

27:30.997 --> 27:32.912
Somebody who remembers
the difference

27:32.955 --> 27:38.134
between the way it was
and the way it is.

27:38.178 --> 27:39.962
- Yeah, but...

27:40.006 --> 27:41.181
what you're talking about,

27:41.224 --> 27:43.618
that can't just be done
in a day.

27:43.662 --> 27:44.967
And it certainly can't be done

27:45.011 --> 27:47.317
in some room in the middle
of Central City.

27:47.361 --> 27:49.363
- I know.

27:49.406 --> 27:52.105
But I still think
you're the man for the job.

27:52.148 --> 27:55.325
Besides, maybe some time
away from Central City

27:55.369 --> 27:58.589
will allow you to figure out
who you want to be

27:58.633 --> 28:00.722
in this post-Crisis world.

28:03.725 --> 28:05.248
- Yeah.

28:07.381 --> 28:08.861
Maybe.

28:18.522 --> 28:20.220
- Here you go.

28:20.263 --> 28:21.656
- Thanks.

28:21.700 --> 28:24.267
- So you gonna tell me?

28:25.878 --> 28:27.401
Your thinking.

28:27.793 --> 28:29.403
Running this story.

28:31.492 --> 28:33.189
- I knew what I was doing, Dad.

28:33.233 --> 28:35.670
- Really, Iris?
Frost told me.

28:35.714 --> 28:37.019
You have fifth-degree burns.

28:37.063 --> 28:38.760
My forensics guys
have been in your office

28:38.804 --> 28:40.240
for hours,
and they found nothing.

28:40.283 --> 28:42.068
There's no bullet holes,
there's no casings.

28:42.111 --> 28:45.724
If that assassin would have...

28:45.767 --> 28:47.726
murdered you today,

28:47.769 --> 28:49.597
I would have no evidence
to bring her in.

28:49.640 --> 28:51.730
- Black Hole
attacked my office.

28:51.773 --> 28:53.209
Dad, they nearly killed
my friends.

28:53.253 --> 28:56.125
They murdered my source
right in front of me.

28:56.169 --> 28:59.041
He's dead because I asked him
to speak up.

28:59.085 --> 29:01.565
And I have to honor that
by exposing each and every

29:01.609 --> 29:03.089
person
behind this organization,

29:03.132 --> 29:05.613
so I'm sorry, Dad,
if you want me to give up--

29:05.656 --> 29:08.398
- I--you know
I wouldn't say that.

29:09.617 --> 29:13.055
But this organization has been
in operation for years,

29:13.099 --> 29:17.407
and their roots run deeper
than you have dug, Iris.

29:17.451 --> 29:20.062
You can't win this war
in a day.

29:20.106 --> 29:23.022
Look, when you and Barry
told me that Crisis was coming,

29:23.065 --> 29:24.850
I was determined to solve

29:24.893 --> 29:27.766
as many cases as I could
because God knows

29:27.809 --> 29:29.898
how many days I have left

29:29.942 --> 29:31.813
to make a difference.

29:31.857 --> 29:34.773
But then Crisis came.

29:34.816 --> 29:35.817
Barry survived.

29:37.123 --> 29:38.864
So now I have to remind myself
every single day

29:38.907 --> 29:41.823
that we don't live
in Crisis mode anymore.

29:41.867 --> 29:43.912
We have time now.

29:46.872 --> 29:49.048
- So what am I
supposed to do, Dad?

29:50.963 --> 29:52.181
How am I supposed
to fight these people?

29:52.225 --> 29:53.792
- Well, first thing's first.

29:53.835 --> 29:55.794
Don't go charging
to the front line

29:55.837 --> 29:58.448
like you have nothing to lose.

29:59.754 --> 30:02.365
Now--okay, your source.

30:02.409 --> 30:08.284
Are you sure he hasn't told
anyone else about Black Hole?

30:08.328 --> 30:10.330
- No, no.

30:19.121 --> 30:23.560
Actually,
someone else did know.

30:47.106 --> 30:48.847
- Can I get you
something to eat?

30:48.890 --> 30:50.283
- No, I'm good, Dad.
Thanks.

30:50.326 --> 30:53.112
- How about a glass of water?
- Yeah, okay.

30:53.155 --> 30:54.853
Sounds good, thanks.

31:09.737 --> 31:10.694
Gotcha.

31:13.959 --> 31:15.656
- Lower your weapon, now.

31:15.699 --> 31:18.398
We've got you surrounded.
Put it on the floor.

31:21.227 --> 31:23.577
- Pretty good Iris, huh?

31:23.620 --> 31:25.013
- Uncanny, babe.

31:28.016 --> 31:29.713
Now it's up to the real one.

31:34.501 --> 31:38.113
- Mr. Carver, hello.

31:38.157 --> 31:41.725
- Ms. West-Allen,
what a surprise.

31:41.769 --> 31:43.162
- I know.

31:43.205 --> 31:46.034
Reports of my death
were greatly exaggerated.

31:46.078 --> 31:47.731
Oh, careful,
there's a scrum of reporters

31:47.775 --> 31:50.343
20 yards down the hall.

31:50.386 --> 31:52.171
Might not be the most
convenient time

31:52.214 --> 31:54.434
to call up your meta-assassin.

31:55.565 --> 31:58.568
- That's quite the allegation
to make without any evidence.

31:58.612 --> 32:00.744
- Oh, no, there's evidence.

32:00.788 --> 32:02.529
You gave it to me.

32:02.572 --> 32:05.140
Your McCulloch ID.

32:05.184 --> 32:08.752
It uses a microchip that
reflects ultraviolet radiation.

32:08.796 --> 32:11.059
And as your former employee
tried to tell me,

32:11.103 --> 32:14.236
it's the same microchip inside
your company's reflector gun

32:14.280 --> 32:16.586
and inside Black Hole's
badges.

32:16.630 --> 32:19.589
Black Hole has been using your
optics technology for years,

32:19.633 --> 32:22.941
all while abducting metas
like Esperanza Garcia

32:22.984 --> 32:24.638
who have light-based powers,

32:24.681 --> 32:27.075
your area of expertise.

32:27.119 --> 32:30.252
You placed Malcolm Strombard
in Gene Huskk's division

32:30.296 --> 32:31.601
so that he could obtain
the rifle

32:31.645 --> 32:32.820
before it went to market.

32:32.863 --> 32:35.170
and then place said rifle
in the hands

32:35.214 --> 32:37.346
of the one person
who could power it:

32:37.390 --> 32:41.655
Kimiyo Hoshi,
your personal assassin.

32:42.525 --> 32:44.049
You weren't robbed
by Black Hole.

32:44.092 --> 32:46.268
You are Black Hole,

32:46.312 --> 32:48.401
and you've been using
McCulloch's resources

32:48.444 --> 32:51.926
to power a global conspiracy
in meta-human trafficking,

32:51.970 --> 32:54.581
weapons sales,
and murder-for-hire.

32:56.670 --> 32:59.020
Now would you care to comment?

32:59.064 --> 33:00.804
- I would.

33:00.848 --> 33:03.111
But I don't think you have
the whole story yet,

33:03.155 --> 33:05.809
because if you did, why would
you be here trying to scare me

33:05.853 --> 33:08.203
while your family
risks their lives for you?

33:10.292 --> 33:12.947
- Weapon down, now!

33:24.045 --> 33:25.960
- You're right.

33:26.004 --> 33:28.310
I can't stop
Black Hole tonight.

33:28.354 --> 33:30.486
But I can't let you
hurt anyone else.

33:32.053 --> 33:34.229
Which is why I've set up
a dead man's switch.

33:34.273 --> 33:37.015
If I, my employees,
any of my sources,

33:37.058 --> 33:39.321
my loved ones die?

33:39.365 --> 33:41.976
All the information I have
tying you to Black Hole

33:42.020 --> 33:43.543
will be immediately released.

33:57.731 --> 33:59.167
Come on.

34:13.573 --> 34:14.704
- Screw you.

34:16.271 --> 34:20.232
- So tell your friend
to stand down.

34:33.941 --> 34:36.204
- That's it?
You're just leaving?

34:38.772 --> 34:40.513
- I follow orders.

34:46.301 --> 34:47.955
- Mr. Carver.
- Mr. Carver.

34:51.872 --> 34:53.134
- Hi, thank you all so much
for coming.

34:53.178 --> 34:54.918
Here--

34:54.962 --> 34:57.138
Given new information
that has come to light,

34:57.182 --> 34:59.097
I have decided that
McCulloch Technologies

34:59.140 --> 35:00.576
will be dropping its lawsuit

35:00.620 --> 35:03.057
against Central City
Citizen Media.

35:05.364 --> 35:07.801
Any questions?

35:19.117 --> 35:20.770
- Thanks for coming.
- Hmm.

35:20.814 --> 35:22.555
- I'm going away for a bit.

35:22.598 --> 35:24.818
I might not have
my Vibe powers anymore,

35:24.861 --> 35:26.472
but at least I can still do

35:26.515 --> 35:28.126
some good, old-fashioned
foot work,

35:28.169 --> 35:31.564
so I'm gonna go suss out

35:31.607 --> 35:35.437
whatever brave new threats
we might have

35:35.481 --> 35:37.657
to our brave new world.

35:37.700 --> 35:39.485
And I was thinking,
in the meantime,

35:39.528 --> 35:42.270
maybe you could hold down
the fort here at S.T.A.R. Labs.

35:45.969 --> 35:47.754
- Ahh.

35:47.797 --> 35:49.364
Oh, wait, you--
you got cameras here?

35:49.408 --> 35:51.236
- There's no cameras.

35:51.279 --> 35:53.455
- This is--
this is some kind of trick.

35:53.499 --> 35:54.978
Right?
- No.

35:55.022 --> 35:57.198
It's not a trick.

35:57.242 --> 35:59.200
It's more of an olive branch.

36:00.201 --> 36:01.289
- Oh.

36:01.333 --> 36:02.769
- I'm sorry
I said those things.

36:02.812 --> 36:05.293
I should have
held myself accountable

36:05.337 --> 36:06.773
for what happened in Crisis,

36:06.816 --> 36:08.992
but instead I chose
to take it out on you.

36:12.344 --> 36:14.955
Anyway, so...

36:16.348 --> 36:18.437
Hitting the road?
- Yeah.

36:23.529 --> 36:25.661
So while I'm gone,
do your best

36:25.705 --> 36:28.534
not to break anything,
will you, Nashville?

36:28.577 --> 36:30.231
- Break everything
while you're gone, got it.

36:30.275 --> 36:31.711
- It's like you're
literally not listening

36:31.754 --> 36:33.408
to what I'm saying.
- What's that?

36:42.156 --> 36:43.897
- Nash?
- Hmm?

36:45.333 --> 36:48.554
- I hope you find
what you're looking for.

37:22.675 --> 37:24.807
- How was Lian Yu with Dig?

37:24.851 --> 37:28.898
- I thought Oliver
left the mask as...

37:28.942 --> 37:30.900
a reminder to keep fighting.

37:30.944 --> 37:32.293
But with all the danger
we've been through,

37:32.337 --> 37:33.860
I guess I kind of

37:33.903 --> 37:37.037
forgot why I made it for him
in the first place.

37:37.864 --> 37:42.260
It was so Oliver
would always remember

37:42.303 --> 37:45.654
to protect the people he loved.

37:47.439 --> 37:49.832
That's why he left it to me.

37:51.181 --> 37:53.401
He wanted me
to take my own advice.

37:53.445 --> 37:54.924
- I've been in overdrive
ever since

37:54.968 --> 37:56.970
we learned that you were
gonna die in Crisis.

37:59.015 --> 38:02.845
I've spent the last month
trying to live every day

38:02.889 --> 38:05.979
like it was my last,
hell-bent on...

38:07.763 --> 38:09.287
Trying to make the most
of the limited time

38:09.330 --> 38:10.766
I thought we had left together,

38:10.810 --> 38:15.815
but Crisis is over now,
and you didn't die.

38:16.729 --> 38:20.298
And I think I just--
I forgot to--

38:20.341 --> 38:21.690
- To slow down.

38:24.476 --> 38:26.739
- So are you also thinking

38:26.782 --> 38:31.352
that tonight maybe
we just take it easy?

38:32.397 --> 38:36.270
- Great minds.
- Beautiful minds.

38:59.249 --> 39:02.296
- Oh, my God.

39:02.340 --> 39:03.993
- Mirror.

39:21.794 --> 39:23.535
- Eva.

41:35.754 --> 41:38.713
- What were you up to,
Eva McCulloch?

42:15.663 --> 42:17.317
- Greg, move your head.
