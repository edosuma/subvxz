00:04.129 --> 00:06.298
Finally Mama's going

00:04.129 --> 00:06.298
to have some pictures

00:06.340 --> 00:09.760
of her beautiful baby

00:06.340 --> 00:09.760
to show all her friends at work.

Seriously, if you want me

01:13.198 --> 01:15.784
and babysit,

01:13.198 --> 01:15.784
I-I don't mind.

01:15.826 --> 01:17.369
Lois looks exhausted.

01:17.411 --> 01:18.579
No, no, no.

01:17.411 --> 01:18.579
We're fine.

01:18.620 --> 01:19.580
We'll see you Monday.

01:19.621 --> 01:21.582
Wait. Isn't today Monday?

01:21.623 --> 01:23.124
HAL:

01:21.623 --> 01:23.124
It's Friday.

01:23.166 --> 01:25.920
Oh, my God, I'm supposed

01:23.166 --> 01:25.920
to be in court today.

01:25.961 --> 01:28.714
I'm filing a restraining order

01:25.961 --> 01:28.714
against my sister.

01:28.756 --> 01:30.131
She thinks that just because

01:30.173 --> 01:33.134
she's been my boyfriend's

01:30.173 --> 01:33.134
first and third wife,

01:33.176 --> 01:35.763
that she has some kind

01:33.176 --> 01:35.763
of a claim on him.

01:36.638 --> 01:38.139
Isn't that...

01:38.181 --> 01:39.474
the cat lady?

01:39.516 --> 01:40.726
I guess.

01:40.768 --> 01:42.644
For a while she was

01:40.768 --> 01:42.644
the naked jogger.

01:42.686 --> 01:45.022
But mostly, she's just

01:42.686 --> 01:45.022
four bucks an hour.

01:45.064 --> 01:47.232
Okay, boys, in the kitchen.

01:45.064 --> 01:47.232
You're making dinner tonight.

01:47.274 --> 01:48.609
Why do we have to?

01:48.650 --> 01:50.277
Because your mother

01:48.650 --> 01:50.277
hasn't had any sleep

01:50.318 --> 01:51.278
for the last four days.

01:51.319 --> 01:54.155
Now get in there.

01:54.197 --> 01:57.952
And keep it down.

01:54.197 --> 01:57.952
She's nursing the baby.

02:02.706 --> 02:04.165
I don't want to go to sleep.

02:04.207 --> 02:05.084
Come on, come on.

02:05.125 --> 02:06.961
I'm telling you,

02:05.125 --> 02:06.961
I am not tired.

02:07.002 --> 02:09.421
Hal, please, just stop

02:07.002 --> 02:09.421
treating me like a child.

02:09.463 --> 02:11.090
Honey, you need your rest.

02:11.131 --> 02:14.134
The boys and I are going

02:11.131 --> 02:14.134
to take care of this baby

02:14.175 --> 02:16.845
for the rest of the night

02:14.175 --> 02:16.845
so you can sleep.

02:16.887 --> 02:19.264
So stop arguing with...

02:20.223 --> 02:22.101
Oh...

02:32.569 --> 02:34.113
Try to get Jamie to eat

02:34.154 --> 02:36.197
while I make a run

02:34.154 --> 02:36.197
for more diapers.

02:36.239 --> 02:37.532
If that nipple gets clogged,

02:37.574 --> 02:38.784
we've got some clean ones

02:37.574 --> 02:38.784
in the drawer.

02:38.826 --> 02:40.494
I'll only be gone

02:38.826 --> 02:40.494
ten minutes,

02:40.535 --> 02:43.872
and I don't want anything

02:40.535 --> 02:43.872
to go wrong during that time.

02:43.914 --> 02:46.792
I am trusting you boys are

02:43.914 --> 02:46.792
mature enough to handle this.

02:47.709 --> 02:49.878
(door closes)

02:49.920 --> 02:52.297
He said "nipple."

02:53.590 --> 02:54.883
Hi, Craig.

02:54.925 --> 02:57.260
When will J.Lo learn?

02:57.302 --> 03:00.179
Take it from a bad boy,

02:57.302 --> 03:00.179
we're nothing but trouble.

03:01.389 --> 03:03.892
Oh. You're buying

03:01.389 --> 03:03.892
the Tidy Winks.

03:03.934 --> 03:05.268
Yes, and I'm in

03:03.934 --> 03:05.268
kind of a hurry.

03:05.310 --> 03:06.895
I don't want to criticize,

03:06.937 --> 03:08.939
but I think I know why

03:06.937 --> 03:08.939
you're buying the Tidy Winks.

03:08.981 --> 03:10.231
It's the absorbency, right?

03:10.273 --> 03:11.900
People always

03:10.273 --> 03:11.900
fall for that,

03:11.942 --> 03:14.402
but what they forget

03:11.942 --> 03:14.402
is the elasticity in the legs

03:14.444 --> 03:15.821
is suspect at best.

03:15.863 --> 03:18.115
Craig, I just...

03:15.863 --> 03:18.115
You know,

03:15.863 --> 03:18.115
since I'm kind of

03:18.157 --> 03:20.117
little Jamie's unofficial,

03:18.157 --> 03:20.117
second alternate godfather,

03:20.159 --> 03:21.702
I've been doing

03:20.159 --> 03:21.702
some research,

03:21.743 --> 03:24.579
and I recommend you

03:21.743 --> 03:24.579
take a look at the Baby Naps.

03:24.621 --> 03:26.247
They've got this

03:24.621 --> 03:26.247
polymer-based fabric

03:26.289 --> 03:28.542
that not only has remarkable

03:26.289 --> 03:28.542
wicking capability,

03:28.583 --> 03:30.044
but actually...

03:30.085 --> 03:31.962
Craig, for God's sakes,

03:30.085 --> 03:31.962
I'm in a hurry.

03:32.004 --> 03:34.213
Now, I just want

03:32.004 --> 03:34.213
the Tidy Winks, okay?

03:34.255 --> 03:35.590
I don't have time

03:34.255 --> 03:35.590
for a big discussion.

03:35.632 --> 03:37.176
Now, please, will you

03:35.632 --> 03:37.176
just ring me up?

03:37.217 --> 03:38.927
Certainly.

03:38.969 --> 03:42.848
That will be $7.98.

03:51.314 --> 03:53.650
Craig, don't make

03:51.314 --> 03:53.650
a thing out of this.

03:53.692 --> 03:55.527
Why, whatever do you mean, Hal?

03:55.569 --> 03:57.946
I'm sorry that I

03:55.569 --> 03:57.946
snapped at you before,

03:57.988 --> 04:00.407
but I really need

03:57.988 --> 04:00.407
these diapers.

04:00.448 --> 04:02.283
Can you loan

04:00.448 --> 04:02.283
me the money?

04:02.325 --> 04:05.162
(laughing)

04:05.204 --> 04:07.039
I could loan you the money, Hal,

04:07.081 --> 04:08.415
but that would be helping you.

04:08.456 --> 04:10.751
And since you have a tendency

04:08.456 --> 04:10.751
to yell at people who try

04:10.792 --> 04:12.002
to help you, I don't think

04:12.044 --> 04:13.545
that's the wisest course

04:12.044 --> 04:13.545
of action

04:13.587 --> 04:14.629
for me to take.

04:14.671 --> 04:15.839
Look, Lois will

04:14.671 --> 04:15.839
pay for these

04:15.881 --> 04:17.049
tomorrow when

04:15.881 --> 04:17.049
she comes in.

04:17.091 --> 04:18.299
You can't take those!

04:18.341 --> 04:19.176
That's shoplifting!

04:19.218 --> 04:20.301
Fine. Then I'm shoplifting.

04:20.343 --> 04:22.096
What are you going

04:20.343 --> 04:22.096
to do about it?

04:22.137 --> 04:23.097
Vernon?

04:23.138 --> 04:24.264
(yells)

04:26.683 --> 04:29.228
(snoring)

04:49.123 --> 04:50.082
(crying)

04:50.124 --> 04:51.332
Where is Dad

04:50.124 --> 04:51.332
with the diapers?

04:51.374 --> 04:52.333
MALCOLM:

04:51.374 --> 04:52.333
Dewey,

04:52.375 --> 04:53.710
triple bag

04:52.375 --> 04:53.710
that diaper

04:53.752 --> 04:55.336
and make sure

04:53.752 --> 04:55.336
the garbage can lid is on tight.

04:55.378 --> 04:57.338
And hold your breath,

04:55.378 --> 04:57.338
because if you pass out,

04:57.380 --> 04:59.299
we're not coming out there

04:57.380 --> 04:59.299
to get you.

05:00.383 --> 05:02.302
Oven mitt.

05:03.637 --> 05:06.306
What a fun... Saturday night.

05:06.347 --> 05:07.891
Nobody's enjoying this, Stevie.

05:07.933 --> 05:09.434
You don't have to be sarcastic.

05:09.476 --> 05:11.603
I wasn't.

05:11.645 --> 05:12.938
(knocking)

05:14.397 --> 05:16.191
Malcolm, right?

05:17.400 --> 05:20.862
Yeah.

05:17.400 --> 05:20.862
See, I told you,

05:17.400 --> 05:20.862
I knew his name.

05:20.904 --> 05:21.947
So, we have a proposal

05:21.989 --> 05:24.074
for you and your

05:21.989 --> 05:24.074
idiot brother.

05:24.908 --> 05:27.119
Oh, my God, another one.

05:27.161 --> 05:29.121
And he's in a wheelchair.

05:29.163 --> 05:30.872
Jackpot.

05:31.414 --> 05:32.373
Kathy?

05:32.415 --> 05:34.876
Do you guys want

05:32.415 --> 05:34.876
to go out on a

05:32.415 --> 05:34.876
date with us?

05:34.918 --> 05:36.962
(sobbing)

05:37.462 --> 05:38.630
(inhaling deeply)

05:38.672 --> 05:41.382
You pray...

05:41.424 --> 05:43.885
and you pray...

05:43.927 --> 05:46.554
and finally...

05:46.596 --> 05:49.099
it happens.

05:54.146 --> 05:55.438
What do you mean, "Go out"?

05:55.480 --> 05:56.439
When? Where?

05:56.481 --> 05:58.357
Right now. With us.

05:58.399 --> 05:59.400
In that.

06:01.778 --> 06:04.072
REESE:

06:01.778 --> 06:04.072
Oh, my God.

06:04.114 --> 06:05.866
I bet it has

06:04.114 --> 06:05.866
a toilet. Dibs!

06:05.907 --> 06:07.075
No way, Reese. We're supposed

06:07.117 --> 06:08.451
to be taking care

06:07.117 --> 06:08.451
of our little brother.

06:08.493 --> 06:09.661
We can't just go riding around

06:09.703 --> 06:11.454
in the coolest car

06:09.703 --> 06:11.454
we've ever seen

06:11.496 --> 06:13.414
with three incredibly hot girls.

06:15.458 --> 06:16.459
Guys! Guys!

06:16.501 --> 06:17.669
I put the lid on tight,

06:17.711 --> 06:19.713
but I think

06:17.711 --> 06:19.713
it's eating through the...

06:19.754 --> 06:21.422
can.

06:21.464 --> 06:24.343
(vehicle departing)

06:24.968 --> 06:27.386
Okay, now, look ashamed.

06:29.056 --> 06:30.473
Look, can I at least

06:30.515 --> 06:33.143
have a phone call

06:30.515 --> 06:33.143
to let my family

06:30.515 --> 06:33.143
know where I am?

06:33.185 --> 06:36.188
Well, technically,

06:33.185 --> 06:36.188
you're not under arrest, so no.

06:36.230 --> 06:38.815
But since we're friends,

06:36.230 --> 06:38.815
I'm going to allow you

06:38.857 --> 06:41.442
to work off your $7.98.

06:41.484 --> 06:45.239
Two hours at minimum wage

06:41.484 --> 06:45.239
ought to do it.

06:53.163 --> 06:57.125
Stop fussing.

06:53.163 --> 06:57.125
I know you're not hungry.

06:57.167 --> 06:59.502
Oh, I know.

06:57.167 --> 06:59.502
You want your pacifier.

06:59.544 --> 07:01.004
Oh, where is it?

07:01.046 --> 07:02.421
What do I do?

07:03.548 --> 07:04.925
Oh, how about a story?

07:04.966 --> 07:06.509
Stories are good.

07:06.551 --> 07:08.469
All right, once upon a time,

07:08.511 --> 07:10.471
there was a little baby

07:08.511 --> 07:10.471
named Jamie

07:10.513 --> 07:12.724
who had a big brother

07:10.513 --> 07:12.724
named Dewey.

07:12.766 --> 07:15.352
Jamie worshipped Dewey.

07:15.394 --> 07:17.938
Dewey and Jamie always

07:15.394 --> 07:17.938
had a good time together.

07:17.979 --> 07:20.732
Even though their hateful,

07:17.979 --> 07:20.732
older brothers always tried

07:20.774 --> 07:22.483
to make their lives miserable.

07:22.525 --> 07:25.070
Hey, Reese,

07:22.525 --> 07:25.070
do you want to have some fun?

07:25.112 --> 07:26.988
Yeah. Fun is good.

07:27.447 --> 07:29.490
(laughing)

07:29.532 --> 07:30.825
Stop it! Put him down!

07:30.867 --> 07:31.952
Stop it!

07:31.993 --> 07:32.827
Shut up, Dewey.

07:32.869 --> 07:34.329
We're bigger than you are.

07:36.039 --> 07:39.500
What do you two boys

07:36.039 --> 07:39.500
think you're doing?!

07:39.542 --> 07:40.543
We're sorry, Mom!

07:40.585 --> 07:41.753
I'm stupid!

07:41.795 --> 07:43.004
DEWEY:

07:41.795 --> 07:43.004
And the two stupid

07:43.046 --> 07:44.089
older brothers paid the price

07:44.131 --> 07:46.049
for their folly.

07:46.091 --> 07:47.384
I've warned you two

07:46.091 --> 07:47.384
about messing

07:47.426 --> 07:48.802
with my favorite children.

07:48.843 --> 07:51.263
Maybe this time

07:48.843 --> 07:51.263
you'll learn to behave!

07:52.055 --> 07:53.807
Well, now you don't

07:52.055 --> 07:53.807
have to worry

07:53.848 --> 07:55.392
about those two anymore.

07:55.434 --> 07:57.477
And, Dewey, just remember...

07:59.604 --> 08:03.233
...don't go near my closet.

08:04.609 --> 08:08.238
Closet. Not bad.

08:11.574 --> 08:12.575
Okay, so here's

08:12.617 --> 08:13.534
the deal, freaks.

08:13.576 --> 08:14.619
Our boyfriends left us

08:14.661 --> 08:16.037
in the middle of the Fall Formal

08:16.079 --> 08:17.538
to go to some stupid party.

08:17.580 --> 08:18.415
Us!

08:18.457 --> 08:20.208
How could Kevin do this to me?

08:20.250 --> 08:21.793
I call him 12 times a day.

08:21.835 --> 08:23.503
I show up at all his practices.

08:23.544 --> 08:25.797
I even changed

08:23.544 --> 08:25.797
my whole schedule so that

08:25.839 --> 08:27.715
we could have all

08:25.839 --> 08:27.715
the same classes.

08:27.757 --> 08:29.092
Well, now

08:27.757 --> 08:29.092
we are going

08:29.134 --> 08:31.552
to pay them

08:29.134 --> 08:31.552
back big-time.

08:31.594 --> 08:32.595
Wait a minute.

08:32.637 --> 08:34.014
There was a Fall Formal?

08:34.055 --> 08:36.308
Why wouldn't we know about that?

08:37.100 --> 08:38.685
Oh.

08:37.100 --> 08:38.685
So, now we're going

08:38.726 --> 08:39.727
to go to

08:38.726 --> 08:39.727
this party

08:39.769 --> 08:40.937
and make out

08:39.769 --> 08:40.937
with you guys

08:40.979 --> 08:42.272
in front of those

08:40.979 --> 08:42.272
inconsiderate jerks.

08:42.314 --> 08:43.606
You want to make them jealous?

08:43.648 --> 08:45.359
No. We want to make them puke.

08:45.400 --> 08:46.651
See, once

08:45.400 --> 08:46.651
they see us kissing

08:46.693 --> 08:47.819
losers like you guys,

08:47.861 --> 08:49.237
they're never going

08:47.861 --> 08:49.237
to live it down.

08:49.279 --> 08:51.239
You came over to our house

08:49.279 --> 08:51.239
and asked us out

08:51.281 --> 08:53.574
because we were the most

08:51.281 --> 08:53.574
disgusting guys you could find?

08:53.616 --> 08:56.577
DRIVER:

08:53.616 --> 08:56.577
Actually, some kid

08:53.616 --> 08:56.577
with a hunchback and gills

08:56.619 --> 08:57.454
turned them down.

08:57.496 --> 08:58.955
Said he had too much pride.

08:58.997 --> 09:00.374
Forget it.

09:00.415 --> 09:01.624
We're not going

09:00.415 --> 09:01.624
to be paraded around

09:01.666 --> 09:03.251
like monkeys on a chain.

09:03.293 --> 09:05.712
You know, we've already been

09:03.293 --> 09:05.712
disappointed once tonight.

09:05.753 --> 09:08.589
Can you stop thinking

09:05.753 --> 09:08.589
about yourself for one second?!

09:08.631 --> 09:10.091
I don't believe this.

09:10.133 --> 09:12.302
I think...

09:12.344 --> 09:13.636
the middle one...

09:13.678 --> 09:16.431
likes you.

09:23.646 --> 09:25.565
(snoring)

09:31.196 --> 09:32.613
Dewey and Jamie had to know

09:32.655 --> 09:34.533
what was inside

09:32.655 --> 09:34.533
the secret closet,

09:34.574 --> 09:36.410
but Mom kept the key hidden

09:34.574 --> 09:36.410
under her pillow.

09:36.451 --> 09:39.579
So they came up

09:36.451 --> 09:39.579
with a brilliant plan.

09:40.747 --> 09:43.791
♪ ♪

10:13.488 --> 10:14.739
Psst!

10:15.449 --> 10:16.657
What are you in for?

10:16.699 --> 10:17.742
Diapers.

10:17.784 --> 10:19.119
Hmm.

10:19.160 --> 10:21.329
Another victim caught up

10:19.160 --> 10:21.329
in the evil net

10:21.371 --> 10:22.663
of Craig Feldspar!

10:22.705 --> 10:23.831
He's a monster.

10:23.873 --> 10:24.999
He treats us

10:25.041 --> 10:27.168
all on the night shift

10:25.041 --> 10:27.168
like dirt!

10:28.002 --> 10:29.337
The absolute power

10:29.379 --> 10:31.381
of Assistant Night Manager

10:29.379 --> 10:31.381
has corrupted him.

10:31.423 --> 10:33.007
We're nothing better

10:31.423 --> 10:33.007
than slaves.

10:33.049 --> 10:34.675
But you're

10:33.049 --> 10:34.675
the employees.

10:34.717 --> 10:35.552
You're the people

10:35.594 --> 10:37.053
who actually run this store.

10:37.095 --> 10:38.346
He doesn't care.

10:38.388 --> 10:39.722
Do you know what

10:38.388 --> 10:39.722
he insists on using

10:39.764 --> 10:41.224
in the coffee machine?

10:41.724 --> 10:43.435
Store brand.

10:43.477 --> 10:46.938
It is so bitter,

10:43.477 --> 10:46.938
it's like drinking death.

10:46.980 --> 10:48.398
He won't change the incline

10:48.440 --> 10:49.983
of the wheelchair ramp

10:48.440 --> 10:49.983
out front.

10:50.024 --> 10:52.944
I stall out every damn day

10:50.024 --> 10:52.944
until somebody gives me a push.

10:52.986 --> 10:53.861
He has an iron grip

10:53.903 --> 10:55.489
on the store radio.

10:55.530 --> 10:57.698
He forces us to listen

10:55.530 --> 10:57.698
only to show tunes.

10:57.740 --> 11:00.701
Even though we voted unanimously

10:57.740 --> 11:00.701
for Adult Contemporary.

11:00.743 --> 11:02.287
What does he have

11:00.743 --> 11:02.287
against Phil Collins?!

11:02.329 --> 11:03.788
(murmuring)

11:03.830 --> 11:05.039
That bastard!

11:05.081 --> 11:06.583
You can't let him

11:05.081 --> 11:06.583
do this to you.

11:06.625 --> 11:09.544
I mean, without you,

11:06.625 --> 11:09.544
he's nothing!

11:10.295 --> 11:11.671
He must be stopped!

11:11.712 --> 11:12.671
Vernon.

11:11.712 --> 11:12.671
Ooh!

11:19.678 --> 11:20.514
I don't know,

11:20.555 --> 11:21.764
maybe Craig's not so bad.

11:21.806 --> 11:24.767
He did give me

11:21.806 --> 11:24.767
the Employee of the Month Award

11:24.809 --> 11:26.478
after I cleaned his aquarium.

11:26.520 --> 11:28.605
Employee of the Month Awards

11:28.647 --> 11:31.024
are the opiate

11:28.647 --> 11:31.024
of the masses.

11:31.065 --> 11:33.734
You people can't let fear

11:31.065 --> 11:33.734
run your lives.

11:33.776 --> 11:37.738
Are you going to act or

11:33.776 --> 11:37.738
suffer under Craig forever?

11:37.780 --> 11:40.867
CRAIG:

11:37.780 --> 11:40.867
Attention, all

11:37.780 --> 11:40.867
Lucky Aide employees.

11:40.908 --> 11:45.205
I need someone to microwave

11:40.908 --> 11:45.205
a three-cheese Hot Pocket ASAP.

11:45.246 --> 11:48.458
The madness ends now.

11:49.042 --> 11:50.418
(sobbing):

11:49.042 --> 11:50.418
I told you

11:50.460 --> 11:52.420
they wouldn't stay

11:50.460 --> 11:52.420
at Lori's party all night.

11:52.462 --> 11:53.880
Well, then we'll go

11:52.462 --> 11:53.880
to Charlotte's party.

11:53.921 --> 11:55.632
If they're not there, then

11:53.921 --> 11:55.632
we'll go to Lisa's party,

11:55.674 --> 11:57.509
and then we'll try

11:55.674 --> 11:57.509
the party out on the pier.

11:57.551 --> 11:59.260
What parties?

11:57.551 --> 11:59.260
Who are these people?

11:59.302 --> 12:01.012
Do we even go

11:59.302 --> 12:01.012
to the same school?

12:01.054 --> 12:03.682
Stop rocking... my boat.

12:03.722 --> 12:06.267
Let's just walk home,

12:03.722 --> 12:06.267
take our horrible

12:03.722 --> 12:06.267
punishment from Dad

12:06.309 --> 12:07.352
and be done with it.

12:07.394 --> 12:08.687
What are you

12:07.394 --> 12:08.687
talking about?

12:08.727 --> 12:10.313
These girls want

12:08.727 --> 12:10.313
to fool around with us.

12:10.355 --> 12:11.772
Only because we're losers.

12:11.814 --> 12:14.317
Hey, we're riding in a limo

12:11.814 --> 12:14.317
we didn't pay for.

12:14.359 --> 12:16.444
We're about to make out

12:14.359 --> 12:16.444
with hot girls

12:16.486 --> 12:17.778
who don't even like us.

12:17.820 --> 12:19.780
I don't know what we are,

12:17.820 --> 12:19.780
but we are not losers.

12:19.822 --> 12:21.782
Have you even

12:19.822 --> 12:21.782
thought about where

12:19.822 --> 12:21.782
this is going?

12:21.824 --> 12:23.660
Her boyfriend is

12:21.824 --> 12:23.660
Aaron Steponovich.

12:23.702 --> 12:24.785
Have you seen that guy?

12:24.827 --> 12:26.454
If he sees you kissing

12:24.827 --> 12:26.454
his girlfriend,

12:26.496 --> 12:27.455
he's going to kill you.

12:27.497 --> 12:29.332
I know.

12:27.497 --> 12:29.332
Then why are you...?

12:29.374 --> 12:30.333
Because anything's better

12:30.375 --> 12:31.792
than the way things are now.

12:31.834 --> 12:33.044
Look...

12:33.086 --> 12:35.046
I've had this

12:33.086 --> 12:35.046
cute lab partner in science

12:35.088 --> 12:36.089
for eight weeks now.

12:36.130 --> 12:37.298
Her name is Cheryl.

12:37.340 --> 12:38.508
I finally left Cheryl

12:38.550 --> 12:40.510
a note on her desk

12:38.550 --> 12:40.510
asking her out.

12:40.552 --> 12:43.555
And when she read it,

12:40.552 --> 12:43.555
she turned to me and said,

12:43.597 --> 12:45.724
"Do you know who Reese is?"

12:46.849 --> 12:50.103
So then she goes, "Does

12:46.849 --> 12:50.103
anybody know who Reese is?"

12:50.144 --> 12:51.688
And everybody shrugged.

12:51.730 --> 12:55.858
So then I said,

12:51.730 --> 12:55.858
"Probably some nobody."

12:55.900 --> 12:57.818
And you know what?

12:57.860 --> 12:59.904
I was right.

13:01.322 --> 13:03.824
Wow. That's awful, kid.

13:03.866 --> 13:06.494
You want to wear my hat?

13:06.536 --> 13:07.912
So tonight

13:06.536 --> 13:07.912
I'm gonna fix that.

13:07.954 --> 13:11.708
From now on, when I walk by,

13:07.954 --> 13:11.708
people are going to say,

13:11.750 --> 13:14.294
"What happened

13:11.750 --> 13:14.294
to that guy's face?"

13:14.335 --> 13:15.836
And someone's going to say,

13:15.878 --> 13:16.921
"That's Reese.

13:16.963 --> 13:20.717
He made out with Aaron

13:16.963 --> 13:20.717
Steponovich's girlfriend."

13:20.759 --> 13:22.552
And that I can live with.

13:22.594 --> 13:25.639
Okay, so, which one

13:22.594 --> 13:25.639
do you want to kiss?

13:25.680 --> 13:27.932
Why don't you just ask me which

13:25.680 --> 13:27.932
kind of roach I'd rather eat?

13:27.974 --> 13:29.016
You are such a wuss.

13:29.058 --> 13:30.560
Okay, watch, I'll do it.

13:37.400 --> 13:38.943
Okay, I can't do this

13:37.400 --> 13:38.943
without a drink.

13:38.985 --> 13:40.236
You guys can get liquor?

13:40.278 --> 13:42.572
We know a store

13:40.278 --> 13:42.572
where this idiot works.

13:42.614 --> 13:45.617
Welcome to our country,

13:42.614 --> 13:45.617
Mrs. Namhong.

13:45.659 --> 13:47.327
I hope you're enjoying

13:45.659 --> 13:47.327
your stay here.

13:47.368 --> 13:49.996
You know, I'm thinking

13:47.368 --> 13:49.996
about retiring to Cambodia.

13:50.037 --> 13:52.749
I hear you can get a hut on the

13:50.037 --> 13:52.749
beach with a wife and servants

13:52.791 --> 13:54.041
for a hundred dollars a month.

13:54.083 --> 13:56.628
The only problem is

13:54.083 --> 13:56.628
I need these special orthotics,

13:56.670 --> 13:58.755
which are very difficult

13:56.670 --> 13:58.755
to find in the tropics.

13:58.797 --> 14:01.048
My condition's

13:58.797 --> 14:01.048
called pronation,

14:01.090 --> 14:02.216
which isn't so bad by itself

14:02.258 --> 14:03.842
but when combined

14:02.258 --> 14:03.842
with hammertoes...

14:05.178 --> 14:08.389
(snoring)

14:11.934 --> 14:13.227
Okay, where was I?

14:13.269 --> 14:14.895
Oh, yeah.

14:14.937 --> 14:18.857
So, Dewey and Jamie waited

14:14.937 --> 14:18.857
until it was late at night...

14:22.612 --> 14:25.865
...and then they made

14:22.612 --> 14:25.865
their move.

14:35.958 --> 14:37.418
Don't worry, Jamie.

14:37.460 --> 14:40.463
Not all trapdoors

14:37.460 --> 14:40.463
lead to dungeons.

14:52.975 --> 14:55.436
Wow.

15:09.242 --> 15:11.952
And that's when they realized,

15:11.994 --> 15:14.955
Mom and Dad had created

15:11.994 --> 15:14.955
a secret good house

15:14.997 --> 15:17.417
which they went to every night

15:14.997 --> 15:17.417
when the kids were asleep,

15:17.458 --> 15:19.878
which is why they're so obsessed

15:17.458 --> 15:19.878
with our bedtimes,

15:19.919 --> 15:21.462
and we never have anything nice,

15:21.504 --> 15:25.925
and why they always come out

15:21.504 --> 15:25.925
of the bedroom smiling!

15:30.054 --> 15:31.890
HAL:

15:30.054 --> 15:31.890
This 90-inch screen

15:31.931 --> 15:32.932
is much better

15:32.973 --> 15:35.017
than the 75-inch

15:32.973 --> 15:35.017
we have in the bathroom.

15:35.059 --> 15:36.310
Oh, absolutely.

15:36.352 --> 15:37.645
By the way,

15:37.687 --> 15:39.731
Dewey asked for ice

15:37.687 --> 15:39.731
cream again today.

15:39.773 --> 15:42.024
I told him we

15:39.773 --> 15:42.024
couldn't afford it.

15:42.066 --> 15:43.443
(both laughing)

15:43.484 --> 15:44.985
Oh, I wonder what he'd do

15:45.027 --> 15:47.280
if he saw

15:45.027 --> 15:47.280
our ice cream helicopter.

15:47.321 --> 15:48.656
(laughing)

15:48.698 --> 15:50.575
These could use

15:48.698 --> 15:50.575
some freshening up.

15:50.617 --> 15:52.660
Did you charge the Brother Bot?

15:52.702 --> 15:54.078
I believe it's good to go.

15:56.038 --> 15:57.957
Drinks, Francis.

15:59.292 --> 16:01.377
(robotic):

15:59.292 --> 16:01.377
You are the worst parents

16:01.419 --> 16:02.503
in the world.

16:02.545 --> 16:04.046
You undermine

16:02.545 --> 16:04.046
my confidence

16:04.088 --> 16:06.006
at every turn.

16:06.048 --> 16:08.676
You are the worst

16:06.048 --> 16:08.676
parents in the world.

16:08.718 --> 16:10.887
And yet, as unbelievable

16:08.718 --> 16:10.887
as all of this was,

16:10.929 --> 16:12.012
it still didn't prepare them

16:12.054 --> 16:14.933
for the biggest surprise

16:12.054 --> 16:14.933
of all,

16:14.974 --> 16:18.937
the most incredible thing

16:14.974 --> 16:18.937
they'd ever seen.

16:20.939 --> 16:25.109
A pair of pants, his size,

16:20.939 --> 16:25.109
that had never been worn

16:25.151 --> 16:27.153
or handed down

16:25.151 --> 16:27.153
from an older brother.

16:27.194 --> 16:29.823
With no holes, no stains,

16:29.864 --> 16:33.159
no funny smell,

16:29.864 --> 16:33.159
no dead stuff in the pockets.

16:33.200 --> 16:36.036
He had to wear those pants.

16:36.078 --> 16:38.498
(alarm sounding)

16:38.539 --> 16:40.917
(screams)

16:40.959 --> 16:42.376
(crying)

16:42.418 --> 16:44.044
Sorry, sorry.

16:44.086 --> 16:46.756
(crying)

16:46.798 --> 16:49.175
It's not so much a paste

16:46.798 --> 16:49.175
as a crust.

16:49.216 --> 16:51.552
I have to have it

16:49.216 --> 16:51.552
scraped off...

16:49.216 --> 16:51.552
Can we just get our...?

16:51.594 --> 16:53.972
(feedback whines)

16:54.013 --> 16:57.767
("Sussudio" begins playing)

17:00.227 --> 17:02.313
Vernon!

17:02.355 --> 17:03.815

18:23.519 --> 18:25.396
Now, when he signs

18:23.519 --> 18:25.396
that confession,

18:25.438 --> 18:26.856
give him his clothes back.

18:26.898 --> 18:28.858
JOANNE:

18:26.898 --> 18:28.858
What are we going to do?

18:28.900 --> 18:30.234
I don't know where

18:28.900 --> 18:30.234
else to get beer.

18:30.276 --> 18:31.277
Can we go home now?

18:31.318 --> 18:32.486
Shut up!

18:32.528 --> 18:33.487
Oh, my God!

18:33.529 --> 18:35.907
Joanne, Aaron's here.

18:40.202 --> 18:41.079
Hey, Aaron!

18:41.120 --> 18:42.830
You think you're

18:41.120 --> 18:42.830
so special?

18:42.872 --> 18:45.541
Well, watch this!

18:42.872 --> 18:45.541
I'll kiss anything!

18:45.583 --> 18:47.043
You don't have to do this,

18:45.583 --> 18:47.043
Reese.

18:47.085 --> 18:48.628
Hey, she's the one

18:47.085 --> 18:48.628
who's disgusted by this,

18:48.669 --> 18:50.296
not me.

18:58.763 --> 19:00.431
Oh, my God!

19:00.473 --> 19:02.182
Jamie's nunu!

19:00.473 --> 19:02.182
What?

19:02.224 --> 19:03.309
Jamie's nunu!

19:03.350 --> 19:04.769
He can't sleep

19:03.350 --> 19:04.769
without his nunu!

19:04.811 --> 19:06.186
We've got to get this home!

19:06.228 --> 19:07.855
Hey!

19:07.897 --> 19:10.650
I'll do anything you want.

19:07.897 --> 19:10.650
Just take us home now.

19:10.691 --> 19:14.361
You know, kid, for a dumb-ass,

19:10.691 --> 19:14.361
you got heart.

19:14.403 --> 19:16.739
(gasps)

19:19.033 --> 19:23.871
Are they... meeting us... later?

19:23.913 --> 19:27.500
So the alarm is going off,

19:23.913 --> 19:27.500
and Dewey and Jamie are trapped.

19:27.541 --> 19:29.919
(alarm blaring)

19:33.255 --> 19:34.757
Oh, my God.

19:34.799 --> 19:36.884
Someone is trying to steal

19:34.799 --> 19:36.884
the perfect pants.

19:36.926 --> 19:38.594
There'll be dire

19:36.926 --> 19:38.594
consequences for this.

19:38.636 --> 19:42.473
Francis, find who's ever

19:38.636 --> 19:42.473
stealing the perfect

19:38.636 --> 19:42.473
pants and stop them!

19:42.515 --> 19:44.266
Do this, do that.

19:44.308 --> 19:45.685
You are terrible parents.

19:45.726 --> 19:47.687
You have made it

19:45.726 --> 19:47.687
impossible for me

19:47.728 --> 19:49.480
to trust another

19:47.728 --> 19:49.480
human being.

19:49.522 --> 19:51.231
You are terrible parents.

19:51.273 --> 19:53.359
(alarm continues)

19:55.319 --> 19:56.779
(gasps)

19:58.197 --> 19:59.782
Jamie, I should

19:58.197 --> 19:59.782
have known it was you.

19:59.824 --> 20:02.242
You are in so

19:59.824 --> 20:02.242
much trouble.

20:02.284 --> 20:03.494
You are grounded.

20:03.536 --> 20:04.912
Do you hear me?

20:04.954 --> 20:07.165
That means no TV,

20:04.954 --> 20:07.165
no phone privileges,

20:07.206 --> 20:09.125
no going out with

20:07.206 --> 20:09.125
your friends.

20:09.167 --> 20:10.334
Nothing!

20:13.546 --> 20:14.922
The moral of the story

20:14.964 --> 20:16.966
is that I'll screw you over

20:14.964 --> 20:16.966
in a heartbeat,

20:17.008 --> 20:18.258
the way my brothers do me.

20:18.300 --> 20:20.386
That's the way it works

20:18.300 --> 20:20.386
around here.

20:20.427 --> 20:21.804
Oh.

20:21.846 --> 20:24.348
You're asleep.

20:25.641 --> 20:26.642
REESE:

20:25.641 --> 20:26.642
Don't worry, Dewey!

20:26.684 --> 20:28.728
We got Jamie's nunu!

20:28.769 --> 20:29.562
What are you doing?

20:29.603 --> 20:30.563
(crying)

20:30.604 --> 20:31.605
(crying stops)

20:31.647 --> 20:32.982
See?

20:33.024 --> 20:34.274
That's all he needed.

20:34.316 --> 20:35.275
Everybody, relax!

20:35.317 --> 20:36.318
I've got the diapers!

20:36.360 --> 20:37.528
Dad!

20:36.360 --> 20:37.528
What?

20:37.570 --> 20:39.279
Way to go.

20:37.570 --> 20:39.279
Jamie was just asleep.

20:39.321 --> 20:41.532
You're so loud.

20:39.321 --> 20:41.532
So how am I supposed

20:39.321 --> 20:41.532
to know that?

20:41.574 --> 20:42.616
(arguing continues)

20:42.658 --> 20:45.078
(snoring)

20:48.789 --> 20:51.751
(Lois coughing)

20:51.792 --> 20:53.293
(arguing continues)

20:53.335 --> 20:54.628
What is going on here?

20:54.670 --> 20:55.880
Oh, my God.

20:55.922 --> 20:58.340
Is that a newspaper diaper?

20:58.382 --> 21:00.218
What have you been doing?!

21:00.259 --> 21:02.553
You've got this baby

21:00.259 --> 21:02.553
so agitated,

21:02.595 --> 21:04.680
he's going to be up all night.

21:04.722 --> 21:06.390
You could take Jamie

21:04.722 --> 21:06.390
for a drive.

21:06.432 --> 21:07.975
That always puts him to sleep.

21:08.017 --> 21:09.435
At this hour?

21:10.853 --> 21:12.312
HAL:

21:10.853 --> 21:12.312
I could get used to this.

21:12.354 --> 21:15.357
I've never been in a limousine

21:12.354 --> 21:15.357
this big before.

21:15.399 --> 21:17.235
Yeah, right.
