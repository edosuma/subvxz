the most important discovery

enough power to operate
the main systems.

00:28.612 --> 00:31.906
This ship simply doesn't have
the capability to dial Earth .

is the better choice.

He has to.
A chance like this?

29:15.921 --> 29:17.880
This is our ticket home.

29:17.965 --> 29:20.091
The word's getting around .
l mean , everyone's
really excited .

29:20.175 --> 29:22.093
(CH UCKLl NG) Hell , yeah .
lt was good timing , too,

29:22.177 --> 29:23.636
because l don't know
about you ,

29:23.720 --> 29:27.098
but l was getting
to the end of my rope here.

29:55.377 --> 29:58.212
lt's weird .
l've never even met your wife.

29:58.881 --> 30:02.008
l only saw that
one picture you had
in your office at lcarus.

30:02.092 --> 30:04.218
Telford ,
you connected with him .

30:06.221 --> 30:07.555
So, what?

30:08.474 --> 30:10.099
This is a residual
memory of his that

30:10.184 --> 30:13.019
somehow transferred
to my subconscious?

30:16.482 --> 30:18.274
Doesn't mean
it was an actual memory.

30:18.358 --> 30:20.234
lt could've been
one of his dreams.

30:21.487 --> 30:24.906
l mean ,
just because l saw her
doesn't mean the two. . .

30:24.990 --> 30:27.283
No. Thanks.

JOHANSEN : Camile ! H i .
T.J .

30:41.089 --> 30:42.590
Dr. Boone told me
about a planet

30:42.674 --> 30:44.759
Rush discovered
in the database.
ls it true?

30:44.843 --> 30:46.552
Yeah , finally
some good news.

30:46.637 --> 30:48.262
l hope it pans out
the way he says it will .

30:48.347 --> 30:49.931
Yeah , so, listen ,
while you were gone,

30:50.015 --> 30:52.767
Colonel Young asked me
to do psych evaluations
on the entire crew,

30:52.851 --> 30:54.560
assess people's
state of mind ,

30:54.645 --> 30:57.021
any red flags that
we might need
to be aware of.

30:57.105 --> 30:58.523
Yeah , that's a good idea.

30:58.607 --> 31:00.650
Yeah , so l was
just kind of wondering

31:00.734 --> 31:04.111
if you had some time
to maybe sit down
and talk to me?

31:04.321 --> 31:06.822
Oh . Right. No problem .
But, you know,

31:06.907 --> 31:08.533
l have some things
l need to do today.

31:08.617 --> 31:09.700
ls tomorrow okay?

31:09.785 --> 31:12.495
Yeah , okay.
Tomorrow's good .

31:17.000 --> 31:18.543
Sorry.
Watch where you're going .

31:18.627 --> 31:19.877
Easy. l said sorry. . .

31:19.962 --> 31:21.128

get out of your way!

with you , man .

Listen to me,

the hell your problem is,

31:28.929 --> 31:30.054

get it together fast!

31:30.138 --> 31:31.889

Shut up !

who ran into who !

this crap, l'm gonna
lock you up for good .

32:16.602 --> 32:17.768
Matthew.

32:20.439 --> 32:23.566
l got an eight-year-old kid
named after me.
How weird is that?

she didn't tell me,

32:38.874 --> 32:41.751
that l couldn't
be there for him .

32:43.378 --> 32:45.046
Look, one more year,

32:45.130 --> 32:49.717

to soccer games
and Little League.

for a short time,
but things happened .

are you doing , airman?

34:10.757 --> 34:13.717
You stay away from my wife,
you pathetic piece of scum !

finger out of my face.
What? Everett?

34:15.303 --> 34:16.429

you get back at me?

Pretend to be me,
crawl into bed with my wife?

34:18.556 --> 34:22.560
No !
He didn't pretend to be you .
He never pretended to be you .

34:22.643 --> 34:24.728
He told me
who he was all along .

34:24.813 --> 34:26.563
And l didn't sleep
with him , by the way,

34:26.648 --> 34:28.482
but thanks
for not jumping
to conclusions.

34:28.734 --> 34:31.777

He's helping
support me through this.

the planetary database.

from the ships
that are seeding the gates?

that didn't quite fit
with the coordinates

No, sir, it can't.

35:16.281 --> 35:17.656
Rush lied .

35:21.536 --> 35:24.580
The lcarus planet
that he discovered
a year away?

35:24.998 --> 35:27.833
lt doesn't exist.
lt's fake data.

35:29.336 --> 35:30.628

to these people.

35:46.645 --> 35:47.686

pointless at the time,
but you persisted .

about this, then?

everyone knows on the ship.

36:09.251 --> 36:11.502
You've just ruined the chance
to maximize productivity.

36:11.586 --> 36:13.587
l wasn't the one
who planted
false information .

36:13.672 --> 36:16.590
There may very well be
an lcarus-type planet
buried in the data.

36:16.675 --> 36:18.133
There may very well be.

36:18.218 --> 36:20.427

scratch the surface,

if you would
just let me use. . .

our salvation . . .

36:25.767 --> 36:27.184

kill somebody!

Why?

37:19.487 --> 37:20.821
You start opening up,

37:20.906 --> 37:24.742
you end up saying
all sorts of personal stuff
you probably shouldn't,

37:24.826 --> 37:26.577

live with these people,
