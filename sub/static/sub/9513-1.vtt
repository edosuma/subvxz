That's the tour from China,

All right, Mr. Navorski, we'd

03:02.099 --> 03:03.100
Next, please.

03:20.575 --> 03:23.954

Take me to Ramada Inn,

Keep the change.

03:47.811 --> 03:51.065
Do you know anyone in New York?

- Who?
- Yes.

04:11.293 --> 04:13.762
161 Lexington.

04:13.837 --> 04:17.591
Okay, Mr. Navorski, I need to
see your return ticket, please.

04:18.841 --> 04:20.844
No, your return ticket.

04:21.720 --> 04:23.313
- Oh. Yes.
- Ah.

04:27.100 --> 04:29.068
This is just a standard procedure.

04:30.604 --> 04:33.653
I'm going to need the passport.

04:33.732 --> 04:35.359
Oh. Oh, okay.

04:35.692 --> 04:38.912
No, no. Mr. Navorski.

04:40.363 --> 04:43.037
That. Passport.

04:45.911 --> 04:47.913
That.

04:53.752 --> 04:55.971
Mr. Navorski? Sorry
to keep you waiting.

04:56.046 --> 05:01.519
I'm Frank Dixon, Director of Customs
and Border Protection here at JFK.

05:01.593 --> 05:04.517
I help people with their
immigration problems.

05:04.596 --> 05:07.190
We're looking for an
interpreter for you.

05:07.265 --> 05:10.064
How are we doing on that?
Do we have an interpreter?

05:11.269 --> 05:14.273
But I understand that you
speak a little English.

05:14.356 --> 05:17.155
- Yes.
- You do?

05:17.234 --> 05:20.738
I hope you don't mind if I eat while
we talk. I've a bit of bad news.

05:20.821 --> 05:23.825
Your country has suspended
all traveling privileges

05:23.907 --> 05:26.660
on passports issued
by your government.

05:26.743 --> 05:29.792
And our State Department
has revoked the visa

05:29.871 --> 05:32.340
that was going to allow
you to enter the U.S.

05:32.415 --> 05:35.089
That's it in a nutshell, basically.

05:35.168 --> 05:39.719
While you were in the air, there was
a military coup in your country.

05:39.798 --> 05:42.893
Most of the dead were members
of the Presidential Guard.

05:42.968 --> 05:45.596
They were attacked in the
middle of the night.

05:45.679 --> 05:47.932
They got it all on GHN, I think.

05:48.014 --> 05:51.393
There were few civilian casualties.
I'm sure your family's fine.

05:51.643 --> 05:55.568
Mr. Navorski, your country
was annexed from the inside.

05:55.647 --> 05:58.196
The Republic of Krakozhia
is under new leadership.

05:58.275 --> 06:01.279
Krakozhia! Krakozhia.

06:02.946 --> 06:08.703
- Krakozhia.
- Right. I don't think he gets it.

06:09.411 --> 06:12.039
Let me... Look.

06:12.122 --> 06:15.251
Imagine that these potato
chips are Krakozhia.

06:15.333 --> 06:20.885
- Krakozhia. Yes. Okay.
- Krakozhia.

06:21.965 --> 06:24.889
So the potato chips are Krakozhia.

06:24.968 --> 06:28.848
- And this apple...
- Big Apple.

06:28.930 --> 06:34.232
Big Apple represents the
Liberty Rebels. Okay?

06:35.729 --> 06:38.357
No more Krakozhia. Okay?

06:38.440 --> 06:43.196
New government.
Revolution. You understand?

06:43.278 --> 06:46.748
All the flights in and out of
your country have been suspended.

06:46.823 --> 06:50.919
The new government has sealed all
borders, so your visa's no longer valid.

06:50.994 --> 06:54.794
So, currently, you are
a citizen of nowhere.

06:54.873 --> 06:56.750
Now, we can't process
you new papers

06:56.833 --> 07:02.806
until the U.S. recognizes your country's
new diplomatic reclassification.

07:02.881 --> 07:05.430
You don't qualify for
asylum, refugee status,

07:05.508 --> 07:08.387
temporary protective status,
humanitarian parole

07:08.470 --> 07:12.725
or non-immigration work travel.
You don't qualify for any of these.

07:12.807 --> 07:15.185
You are at this time simply...

07:17.145 --> 07:20.775
- ...unacceptable.
- Unacceptable.

07:20.857 --> 07:23.110
- Unacceptable.
- Unacceptable.

07:23.193 --> 07:26.447
Big Apple tour includes
Brooklyn Bridge,

07:26.529 --> 07:30.079
Empire State, Broadway show Cats.

07:30.158 --> 07:33.412
I got more bad news
for you. Cats has closed.

07:33.870 --> 07:35.338
Okay. Okay.

07:35.413 --> 07:38.462
Now I go New York City. Thank you.

07:38.541 --> 07:42.842
No, Mr. Navorski. I cannot allow you to
enter the United States at this time.

07:42.921 --> 07:46.300
- Krakozhia.
- We can't allow you to go home either.

07:46.383 --> 07:50.229
You don't really have a home.
Technically, it doesn't exist.

07:50.303 --> 07:55.901
It's like a <i>Twilight Zone.</i>
Do you get that show over there?

07:55.976 --> 07:59.196
"Talking Tina," "Nightmare at
30,000 Feet," "Zanti Misfits."

07:59.270 --> 08:01.773
"Zanti Misfits" was
Outer Limits, sir.

08:01.856 --> 08:03.824
Oh, really? It's not important.

08:03.900 --> 08:06.494
Where do I buy the Nike shoes?

08:07.320 --> 08:09.948
Okay, Mr. Navorski,
come here. Walk with me.

08:10.031 --> 08:12.284
Here's my dilemma, Mr. Navorski.

08:12.367 --> 08:16.213
You have no right to enter the U.S.
and I have no right to detain you.

08:16.287 --> 08:18.881
You have fallen through
a crack in the system.

08:18.957 --> 08:22.882
- I am crack.
- Yes. Until we get this sorted out,

08:22.961 --> 08:27.137
I will allow you to enter the
International Transit Lounge.

08:27.215 --> 08:30.890
I'm going to sign a release form that
is going to make you a free man.

08:30.969 --> 08:33.142
- Free?
- Free.

08:33.221 --> 08:34.972
Free to go anywhere you like

08:35.056 --> 08:39.232
within the confines of the
International Transit Lounge.

08:39.309 --> 08:41.312
- Okay?
- Okay

08:41.438 --> 08:43.405
- Okay?
- Okay

08:43.690 --> 08:44.691
Okay.

08:45.150 --> 08:47.869
Uncle Sam will have this
sorted out by tomorrow,

08:47.944 --> 08:50.367
and welcome to the
United States. Almost.

08:51.990 --> 08:55.244
- Thank you.
- Thanks, Judge.

09:16.222 --> 09:19.396
Now, Mr. Navorski.

09:21.311 --> 09:23.985
This is the International
Transit Lounge.

09:24.064 --> 09:27.113
You are free to wait here.
These are food vouchers.

09:27.192 --> 09:29.194
You can use them in the Food Court.

09:29.277 --> 09:31.405
Your Krakozhian money
is no good here.

09:31.488 --> 09:34.367
This is a 15-minute,
prepaid calling card.

09:34.449 --> 09:36.952
You may call home, if you like.

09:37.035 --> 09:41.085
This, in case we need to
contact you, is a pager.

09:41.164 --> 09:43.667
You must keep this
with you at all times.

09:44.501 --> 09:50.179
Here is an ID badge for you to get
into CBP. Beyond those doors...

09:50.256 --> 09:54.056
Mr. Navorski. I'm going to
need you to look at me.

09:54.135 --> 09:56.888
Beyond those doors
is American soil.

09:56.971 --> 09:59.520
Mr. Dixon wants me to make it clear

09:59.599 --> 10:02.443
that you are not to enter
through those doors.

10:02.519 --> 10:06.945
You are not to leave this
building. America is closed.

10:07.023 --> 10:09.025
America closed.

10:10.193 --> 10:12.070
What I do?

10:13.196 --> 10:16.951
There's only one thing you
can do here, Mr. Navorski.

10:17.033 --> 10:19.035
Shop.

10:19.410 --> 10:23.460
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,

<i>the international community</i>

<i>tries to make inroads to
a peaceful resolution.</i>

10:35.301 --> 10:40.102
<i>The populace has to wonder if they
will ever find political stability,</i>

10:40.181 --> 10:45.187
<i>or find the leadership to secure

<i>And next this hour, looking

10:58.491 --> 11:03.088
<i>along with four cabinet members,

11:03.163 --> 11:06.167
<i>By dawn, rebel leaders had
surrounded the state houses.</i>

11:06.249 --> 11:10.174
<i>In a symbolic gesture, the national
flag of Krakozhia was torn down</i>

11:10.253 --> 11:13.757
<i>from the Presidential Palace

I'm sorry, sir. This
is a private lounge.

The public lounge is downstairs.

<i>The tiniest nation in the region</i>

I got this in Paris.
This is my favorite bag.

14:41.339 --> 14:46.516
I can't believe you just broke my bag.
Mom, Dad. He broke my bag.

14:55.812 --> 15:00.613
- Food document.
- Excuse me. Stop it.

15:00.691 --> 15:03.240
Do you have an appointment?

15:03.319 --> 15:09.292

Okay, goodbye. sorry.

Has a 120-volt generator,
wet bar, gas range.

18:41.454 --> 18:43.422
She looks amazing.

18:43.497 --> 18:45.966
She's my pot of gold at
the end of the rainbow.

18:46.042 --> 18:48.921
She's a beautiful boat, and
I hope you get her soon.

18:49.003 --> 18:52.098
- You've earned her.
- Thank you, Frank.

18:52.173 --> 18:54.972
- You have.
- Actually, I bought her yesterday.

18:55.051 --> 18:58.021
Oh, come on. Congratulations.

18:58.095 --> 19:00.814
Frank, I'm nominating
you to take my place.

19:01.557 --> 19:05.061
You will assume the duties
of acting Field Commissioner

19:05.144 --> 19:07.988
until you get approval
from Washington.

19:08.064 --> 19:10.613
Really? I don't know what to say.

19:11.567 --> 19:15.071
- Jesus. Richard, is this real?
- Oh, it's real, Frank.

19:15.154 --> 19:17.748
Don't pretend to be surprised.

19:19.742 --> 19:23.167
You've been waiting for me to
retire or drop dead for years now.

19:23.245 --> 19:26.044
No, I haven't been waiting
for you to retire.

19:28.084 --> 19:29.757
That's all right, Frank.

19:29.835 --> 19:33.590
My retirement will become official
the day you get sworn in.

19:36.759 --> 19:40.730
- You've waited a long time for this.
- I have.

19:40.805 --> 19:44.526
Just be careful about
the inspection process.

19:44.600 --> 19:47.604
I will. I've been
here for 17 years...

19:47.687 --> 19:50.816
We're talking about the Field
Commissioner position.

19:50.898 --> 19:55.199
People are going to look to you for
leadership, to set an example.

19:57.530 --> 19:58.782
What are you saying?

20:01.826 --> 20:05.205
I'm saying the job
is yours to lose.

20:07.456 --> 20:09.754
Ship the Colombians off to asylum
hearings, backgrounds on the Chinese

20:09.834 --> 20:12.587

kids from Long Island.

20:12.670 --> 20:15.594
Tell them it was a bad idea
to let them go to Jamaica.

20:15.673 --> 20:18.973
Come on, let's go. South America
and Madrid are on the tarmac.

20:19.051 --> 20:21.304
I want them out of
here in half an hour.

20:25.850 --> 20:28.569
Mr. Thurman.

20:28.644 --> 20:32.865
There's a man walking around
the terminal in a bathrobe.

20:32.940 --> 20:36.615
I know, sir. You put him there.

20:58.007 --> 21:00.055
Next.

21:03.679 --> 21:05.226
I need visa.

21:05.306 --> 21:08.936
Where's your green form?
I can't do anything without it.

21:09.018 --> 21:10.941
Go to the wall.

21:11.020 --> 21:12.522
Next!

21:14.857 --> 21:16.700
Sir.

21:19.779 --> 21:22.202
The light green form.

21:25.326 --> 21:29.206
<i>I love New York...</i>

21:48.849 --> 21:51.147
Light green.

21:53.312 --> 21:56.816
Mr. Navorski, you cannot get
into New York without a visa.

21:56.899 --> 21:59.027
You cannot get a visa
without a passport,

21:59.109 --> 22:01.953
and you cannot get a new
passport without a country.

22:02.029 --> 22:04.703
There's nothing we
can do for you here.

22:04.782 --> 22:06.784
I give you light green.

22:06.867 --> 22:09.996
I'm sorry, but you've
wasted an entire day.

22:10.079 --> 22:12.081
At this time, you are simply...

22:13.749 --> 22:16.343
- Unacceptable.
- Yes.

22:16.418 --> 22:17.419
Unacceptable.

22:19.630 --> 22:21.348
Why is he still here?

22:21.423 --> 22:24.677
You released him, sir.
You put him there.

22:25.845 --> 22:29.816
Why doesn't he walk out the doors?
Why doesn't he try to escape?

22:29.890 --> 22:34.862
- Sir, you told him to wait.
- I didn't think he'd actually do it.

22:37.731 --> 22:41.406
I mean, he's in a crack. Who
the hell waits in a crack?

22:41.485 --> 22:43.237
No news from the State Department,

22:43.320 --> 22:45.948
but we can deport
him in a few days.

22:46.031 --> 22:49.786
Yeah, it could be a few days. It
could be a week, two weeks, a month.

22:49.869 --> 22:53.624
Who knows what this guy is thinking,
what gulag he escaped from.

22:57.751 --> 23:00.220
Everything he does
comes back to me.

23:00.296 --> 23:04.096
- You want him back in the holding cell?
- No, I'll show him the door.

23:06.010 --> 23:07.887
Hello.

23:11.807 --> 23:15.277
- Do you have an appointment?
- Yes. 9:30.

23:15.352 --> 23:18.731
Food document, trash. Tuesday.

23:18.814 --> 23:22.159
Tuesday. I hate the Tuesday.

23:22.234 --> 23:23.827
Excuse me.

23:50.304 --> 23:53.524
Airports are tricky
places, Mr. Navorski.

23:54.683 --> 23:57.106
I'm about to tell you something.

23:57.186 --> 23:59.939
Something you can never
repeat to anyone.

24:00.022 --> 24:02.775
Do you understand? It's a secret.

24:02.858 --> 24:05.407
- Secret?
- Yes, a secret.

24:05.486 --> 24:11.368
At 12:00 today, the guards at those
doors will leave their posts

24:11.450 --> 24:14.704
and their replacements are
going to be five minutes late.

24:14.787 --> 24:16.915
Late five minutes.

24:16.997 --> 24:22.128
Yes. Late five minutes. At 12:00.
Just today. Just this once.

24:22.211 --> 24:24.384
No one is going to be
watching those doors.

24:24.463 --> 24:29.185
- And no one will be watching you.
- So, America not closed.

24:29.259 --> 24:30.385
No.

24:30.469 --> 24:34.565
America, for five minutes, is open.

24:34.640 --> 24:36.358
Have a nice life, Mr. Navorski.

24:36.433 --> 24:40.028
<i>United Airlines, final
boarding call...</i>

24:46.819 --> 24:50.164
Catch and release. It's simple.
Sometimes you land a small fish.

24:50.239 --> 24:53.334
You unhook him and place
him back in the water.

24:53.409 --> 24:58.256
You set him free so that somebody else
can have the pleasure of catching him.

25:01.375 --> 25:03.719
All right, here we go.

25:03.794 --> 25:06.013
Okay. Call them off.

25:06.088 --> 25:08.386
Johnson, clear the doors.

25:11.427 --> 25:12.428
All right. Go.

25:12.511 --> 25:15.936
Get out of there.
All right, there's the door.

25:18.851 --> 25:21.525
Here we go. Now where is he?

25:21.603 --> 25:24.482
- There he is. Are you sure?
- No, that's not him.

25:24.565 --> 25:26.738
There he is. Okay.

25:26.817 --> 25:30.492
All right, Viktor. Here we go.

25:47.629 --> 25:51.429
What's so complicated?
Exit, Viktor.

25:51.508 --> 25:55.058
Come on. In a few minutes, you'll
be somebody else's problem.

25:55.137 --> 25:57.310
He wants to make sure
nobody's watching.

25:57.389 --> 26:00.017
I told him nobody
would be watching.

26:00.100 --> 26:03.400
Come on. All right, here we go.

26:03.479 --> 26:05.982
- Call the Airport Police.
- He's on his way.

26:07.816 --> 26:08.817
Excuse me.

26:29.171 --> 26:31.924
- You got it. There we go.
- Ah!

26:32.007 --> 26:36.183
He's got to get a running start,
I guess. Come on. Just leave.

26:36.887 --> 26:40.016
Just leave. Leave. Leave.

26:40.099 --> 26:43.569
What are you doing? Why is
he kneeling? Is he praying?

26:43.644 --> 26:46.318
No. He's tying his shoelace.

26:51.944 --> 26:56.199
Come on, leave. Get the cameras.

27:03.163 --> 27:06.633
Where is he? Where is he?

27:11.213 --> 27:14.137
- To the left of here.
- No. He was just at the door.

27:14.216 --> 27:17.095
- Just go a little left.
- All right.

27:26.228 --> 27:27.605
I wait.

27:34.862 --> 27:38.287
What are you looking at?
Go back to work. Thank you.

27:45.706 --> 27:48.835
Oh, God. Shit.

27:57.217 --> 28:00.312
- This belong you? Please, please.
- Thank you.

28:00.387 --> 28:02.264
Oh, shit.

28:03.557 --> 28:06.982
See? Wet floor.

28:07.060 --> 28:08.528
That you.

28:08.604 --> 28:10.197
I'm so late.

28:10.272 --> 28:13.025
Buenos Aires. I can't
remember the gate.

28:13.108 --> 28:15.236
Gate 24.

28:15.319 --> 28:17.663
- You sure?
- Yes.

28:19.281 --> 28:21.124
Thanks.

28:24.119 --> 28:26.213
Wait.

28:26.288 --> 28:29.041
For you. Payless Shoes.

28:29.124 --> 28:31.627
Second floor. Sensible heels.

28:44.681 --> 28:47.184
- Hi, baby.
- Come here, you.

28:53.315 --> 28:59.072
<i>I think he's CIA. The CIA
put him here to spy on us.</i>

28:59.154 --> 29:03.000
You don't know what you're talking
about. He doesn't speak English.

29:03.075 --> 29:05.419
If he could learn
to speak, this guy.

29:05.494 --> 29:09.544
He can't speak English, how could he
have a meeting with a beautiful woman?

29:09.623 --> 29:11.045
A flight attendant.

29:11.124 --> 29:13.502
- Oh, so, she's CIA, too?
- No.

29:13.585 --> 29:19.342
She look like a Russian. KGB.
She gave him heel of her shoes.

29:19.424 --> 29:21.392
And he gave her a
piece of the paper.

29:21.468 --> 29:26.099
- Was it microfilm?
- A coupon from Payless Shoes.

29:26.181 --> 29:28.604
Must be some kind of the code.

29:28.684 --> 29:33.485
You been spending too much time
inhaling them cleaning products.

29:33.563 --> 29:36.692
I'm warning you guys.
You watch yourself.

29:36.775 --> 29:41.702
This guy is here for a reason.
And I think that reason is us.

30:02.467 --> 30:04.265
Excuse me, buddy.

30:26.158 --> 30:27.535
What's going on?

30:27.617 --> 30:30.871
It's Navorski. He's
figured out the quarters.

30:55.103 --> 30:59.108
Good afternoon. Welcome to Burger
King. May I take your order?

31:02.486 --> 31:03.908
Keep the change.

31:24.716 --> 31:25.968
Excuse me.

31:30.889 --> 31:33.984
Okay, go. Go.

31:36.186 --> 31:39.235
Good boy. Thank you.

31:40.273 --> 31:41.274
Bye-bye.

31:59.292 --> 32:01.761
Welcome to Burger King.
May I take your...

32:28.738 --> 32:32.368
"Crisis. Krakozhia."

32:32.451 --> 32:34.499
<i>Now that heavy
fighting has subsided</i>

32:34.578 --> 32:37.627
<i>and both sides have dug in
for the long winter ahead,</i>

32:37.706 --> 32:42.177
<i>it's clear that the future of Krakozhia
may be in doubt for some time to come.</i>

32:42.252 --> 32:45.847
<i>Meanwhile, the people of Krakozhia
suffer the consequences.</i>

32:45.922 --> 32:48.266
"And food..."

32:49.426 --> 32:51.895
<i>Have caused food and
energy shortages.</i>

32:51.970 --> 32:53.972
"...In Krakozhia."

33:16.620 --> 33:21.421
"The story of Broadway is the..."

33:26.046 --> 33:27.969
"The cast"

33:28.048 --> 33:32.804
"of comedy hit <i>Friends,</i>"

33:32.886 --> 33:36.732
"which is set in New York."

33:38.600 --> 33:40.193
<i>Friends.</i>

33:41.436 --> 33:42.437
<i>Friends.</i>

33:50.070 --> 33:52.038
<i>Due to the heavy snowfall,</i>

33:52.113 --> 33:54.866
<i>all flights have been canceled...</i>

34:04.084 --> 34:07.930
"Wayne Newton is 61 today."

34:08.004 --> 34:10.005
"It's a miracle."

34:11.507 --> 34:16.435
"Korean conjoined twins
separated today in Miami."

34:16.513 --> 34:19.891
"Chances of survival 50-50."

34:19.975 --> 34:21.147
50-50.

34:25.021 --> 34:26.648
Next.

34:28.858 --> 34:31.077
Let me ask you
something, Mr. Navorski.

34:31.152 --> 34:34.907
Why do you wait here every day when
there's nothing I can do for you?

34:34.989 --> 34:40.042
Your new visa will not arrive until
your country is recognized by the U.S.

34:40.954 --> 34:42.956
You have two stamp.

34:43.039 --> 34:46.009
One red, one green.

34:46.083 --> 34:51.636
- So?
- I have chance to go New York, 50-50.

34:55.427 --> 34:59.398
Yes. That's a beautiful way to look at
it, but America doesn't work that way.

35:13.737 --> 35:18.413
As acting Field Commissioner, I've
created a new position here at JFK.

35:18.491 --> 35:22.792
Transportation Liaison for
Passenger Assistance.

35:23.663 --> 35:26.917
Sir, what will that person do?

35:31.755 --> 35:34.804
Thank you. I'll take it from here.

35:37.010 --> 35:40.856
I'm Transportation Liaison in
charge of Passenger Assistance.

35:49.564 --> 35:51.942
No carts, no quarters.
No quarters, no food.

35:52.025 --> 35:56.997
It'll be days before he goes through the
doors in violation of section 2.14.

35:57.072 --> 35:58.699
Then he's somebody else's problem.

35:58.782 --> 36:01.831
Why don't we tag him in
violation of section 2.14 now?

36:01.910 --> 36:05.710
- Then ship him to detention.
- He has to break the law by leaving.

36:05.789 --> 36:09.089
I won't lie, particularly to
get rid of somebody like him.

36:45.286 --> 36:47.835
- Sorry, buddy.
- Honey!

37:10.645 --> 37:13.114
Put it down. Put it down.

37:14.649 --> 37:16.242
Put it down.

37:17.652 --> 37:21.156
You try to take my mop.
You try to take my floor.

37:21.239 --> 37:25.745
It's my job. Stay off my floor.
Stay away from my mop.

37:25.827 --> 37:28.580
- Food.
- If you touch it again, I kill you.

37:42.010 --> 37:45.014
Hey. I'm Enrique Cruz.

37:48.558 --> 37:50.560
We need to talk.

37:54.814 --> 37:58.239
- I want to make a deal with you.
- What deal?

37:58.318 --> 38:01.822
I need information on
CBP Officer Torres.

38:01.905 --> 38:04.909
You feed me information about
her, and I'll feed you.

38:04.991 --> 38:08.495
- What do you want know?
- You see her every day.

38:08.578 --> 38:13.129
I want to know what
makes her knees weak.

38:13.208 --> 38:18.556
What makes her blood boil
and her body tingle.

38:18.630 --> 38:21.804
She's a wild stallion, and
you'll help me break her.

38:21.883 --> 38:25.683
I'm... I'm her man of mystery.

38:25.762 --> 38:30.734
- Officer Torres is wild stallion?
- Her name is Dolores.

38:30.809 --> 38:34.780
You help me to win her heart, and
you'll never go hungry again.

38:37.148 --> 38:39.822
- I do this.
- Really? Promise?

38:39.901 --> 38:43.075
- Yes.
- Okay. Thank you.

38:43.571 --> 38:45.869
What mean, "wild stallion"?

38:53.289 --> 38:56.964
Officer Torres. My friend

Okay.

40:51.950 --> 40:54.169

- No cheat.
- No chit.

42:12.530 --> 42:14.874
No. I won't cheat.

42:14.949 --> 42:18.123
She's a nice girl. She
won't take your chitting.

42:23.624 --> 42:24.750
Next.

42:25.752 --> 42:30.053
Officer Torres. Have you
been ever in the love?

42:30.131 --> 42:33.476
Enough, Viktor. Who is it?

42:33.885 --> 42:36.138
Who's telling you to
ask me these things?

42:36.220 --> 42:38.348
It's a man of misery.

42:41.476 --> 42:43.399
Misery?

42:43.478 --> 42:47.949
- Mystery?
- No, no. Misery. Man of misery.

42:48.483 --> 42:50.702
He's so sick. He's so in love.

42:52.737 --> 42:54.410
But what did she say?

42:54.489 --> 42:57.914
She did say, "next, next."

42:57.992 --> 43:00.541
And now she say,
"Please. Please come."

43:00.620 --> 43:02.668
That's... Wait.

43:07.877 --> 43:10.972
- I coming now.
- No, wait. Viktor.

43:11.047 --> 43:13.926
Viktor, just tell me more.

43:14.008 --> 43:15.931
I coming. I coming.

43:16.010 --> 43:18.012
Please, please.

43:35.071 --> 43:39.952
Beeper went off. Started beeping.
So, I grab. I come.

43:40.034 --> 43:42.583
We have an idea.

43:42.662 --> 43:45.006
Would you like something to eat?

43:45.081 --> 43:47.550
No. No food. I stuffed.

43:52.755 --> 43:54.132
Thank you.

43:54.215 --> 43:57.890
So, Mr. Navorski, I have
some very good news for you.

43:57.969 --> 43:59.391
What?

44:00.012 --> 44:03.391
I've figured out a way to get
you out of this airport.

44:03.474 --> 44:05.147
How?

44:05.226 --> 44:09.402
Well, we have laws here
that protect aliens

44:09.480 --> 44:13.155
who have a credible fear of
returning to their own country.

44:13.234 --> 44:15.612
If we can establish
this fear with you,

44:15.695 --> 44:21.247
then the CBP will be forced to begin
Expedited Removal Procedures,

44:21.325 --> 44:27.128
to bring you to an immigration judge and
let you plead your case for asylum.

44:27.206 --> 44:29.425
Asylum.

44:29.500 --> 44:34.597
Unfortunately, the courts are
so backed up with asylum cases

44:34.672 --> 44:39.519
that the soonest you'd get before a
judge would be six months from now.

44:39.594 --> 44:43.349
Yes, and we would have no choice

44:43.431 --> 44:48.608
but to let you go for those six months.
It's the law. You'd be released.

44:48.686 --> 44:51.530
You would be free to wait in New
York until your court date.

44:51.606 --> 44:56.908
But, believe it or not, most people
never show up before the judge.

44:57.445 --> 45:01.370
- So I go New York City?
- Uh-huh.

45:01.449 --> 45:03.793
You can go to New
York City tonight.

45:03.868 --> 45:08.089
But you only get to go if we
can establish a credible fear.

45:08.664 --> 45:12.259
- Fear?
- Mmm-hmm. Fear.

45:12.335 --> 45:16.465
- From what?
- That's the best part.

45:16.547 --> 45:21.053
It doesn't matter what you're afraid of.
It's all the same to Uncle Sam.

45:21.135 --> 45:23.558
So I'm going to ask
you one question.

45:23.638 --> 45:27.984
If you give me the correct answer,
I can get you out of this airport tonight.

45:30.394 --> 45:32.362
So, I answer one question.

45:33.689 --> 45:36.238
Go to New York City. Tonight.

45:36.317 --> 45:38.319
- Tonight.
- Tonight.

45:43.157 --> 45:45.080
- Okay.
- Okay.

45:45.159 --> 45:46.160
Okay.

45:47.328 --> 45:51.799
Do you, at this time, have any fear
of returning to your own country?

45:51.874 --> 45:53.501
No.

45:58.714 --> 46:01.308
Okay. Let me try it again.

46:02.343 --> 46:05.222
- Your country's at war.
- Yes. War.

46:05.304 --> 46:08.649
There are men in the streets
with guns. Political persecution.

46:08.724 --> 46:11.273
- Yes. It's terrible.
- Yeah, it's horrible.

46:11.352 --> 46:13.480
And God only knows
what could happen.

46:13.562 --> 46:16.236
Innocent people are
torn from their beds.

46:16.315 --> 46:19.194
On Tuesdays. I hate Tuesdays.

46:19.277 --> 46:21.325
So you're afraid.

46:21.404 --> 46:24.578
- From what?
- Krakozhia.

46:24.657 --> 46:29.538
- You're afraid of Krakozhia.
- Krakozhia?

46:29.620 --> 46:33.124
No, I am not afraid from Krakozhia.

46:33.207 --> 46:36.256
I'm a little afraid of this room.

46:38.212 --> 46:42.137
I'm talking about bombs.
I'm talking about human dignity.

46:42.216 --> 46:43.217
Human rights.

46:43.301 --> 46:48.228
Viktor, please don't be afraid to
tell me you're afraid of Krakozhia.

46:48.973 --> 46:53.444
Is home. I am not
afraid from my home.

46:55.229 --> 46:59.234
So? I go to New York City now?

47:00.985 --> 47:02.987
- No.
- No?

47:05.448 --> 47:06.791
Okay.

47:06.866 --> 47:11.167
- I'm afraid from ghosts.
- Thanks very much.

47:11.245 --> 47:14.294
- I'm afraid from Dracula.
- Thanks a lot.

47:15.249 --> 47:19.846
I'm afraid from Wolfmens,
afraid from sharks.

47:19.920 --> 47:21.137
Thanks a lot.

47:31.766 --> 47:36.522
- Why you do this?
- Nobody read the sign in America.

47:38.356 --> 47:40.358
This is the only fun I have.

47:41.567 --> 47:45.242
A barbecue? That's why
I'm not going to see you?

47:45.321 --> 47:49.201
Let me get this straight.
I change my schedule to meet you.

47:49.283 --> 47:51.502
I take four back-to-back flights,

47:51.577 --> 47:55.627
fly 27 hours straight
literally around the world,

47:55.706 --> 47:59.552
and now you tell me you're going
to spend July 4th with your wife?

47:59.627 --> 48:01.629
The woman hates fireworks.

48:03.464 --> 48:06.217
Don't lie to me, okay?

48:06.300 --> 48:09.725
I know for a fact you took
her to Rome last weekend.

48:09.804 --> 48:12.273
Because you flew United, Max.

48:31.200 --> 48:35.501
You make a habit out of listening
to other people's conversations?

48:36.455 --> 48:39.584
No, I try to call home.

48:39.667 --> 48:42.295
So then...

48:43.045 --> 48:46.515
- You know why men are such assholes?
- No.

48:50.678 --> 48:53.306
Because they're all liars.

48:54.014 --> 48:55.766
Wait.

48:57.601 --> 48:58.898
Wet floor.

48:58.978 --> 49:00.776
Please. Don't be hurt.

49:00.855 --> 49:02.607
How can I not be? He's married.

49:02.690 --> 49:04.738
One man. Two womens. Crowded.

49:04.817 --> 49:06.819
You want to know what
the worst part is?

49:06.902 --> 49:11.248
I never asked him to leave his wife.
I encouraged him to get counseling.

49:11.323 --> 49:14.202
What kind of sick person am I?

49:14.285 --> 49:16.663
I'm rooting for the home team.

49:22.209 --> 49:24.712
I just wish the sex
wasn't so amazing.

49:27.590 --> 49:29.592
- So amazing.
- Bye-bye.

49:30.759 --> 49:35.515
You know, sometimes
in the mornings,

49:35.598 --> 49:38.818
I just stare at him
over room service.

49:38.893 --> 49:41.396
Watch him do the crossword puzzle.

49:42.855 --> 49:47.736
I start to think that maybe,
maybe this could happen.

49:49.737 --> 49:51.865
That we belong together.

49:54.700 --> 49:59.297
This man has you.

50:00.581 --> 50:04.757
Why he need puzzle?

50:06.504 --> 50:08.723
This is my problem.

50:08.797 --> 50:11.721
I always see men the way
I want to see them.

50:16.430 --> 50:18.398
Do I know you from someplace?

50:19.808 --> 50:22.687
Sensible heels. Payless
Shoes. Second floor.

50:28.108 --> 50:30.110
You headed for home?

50:31.529 --> 50:32.872
No, no. I am...

50:34.031 --> 50:38.286
I am delayed a long time.

50:38.661 --> 50:42.541
I hate it when they delay
flights. What do you do?

50:42.623 --> 50:47.675
Oh, I go from one building
to another building.

50:48.087 --> 50:51.387
I have beeper.

50:51.465 --> 50:55.936
Oh, contractors. You guys
travel as much as we do.

50:56.011 --> 50:57.012
Ah.

50:58.806 --> 51:01.480
Sorry about that.
Thank you very much.

51:01.559 --> 51:02.776
What's "BH"?

51:02.851 --> 51:04.853
In English,

51:06.146 --> 51:07.989
Viktor Navorski.

51:08.649 --> 51:13.530
- In English, Amelia Warren.
- Amelia Warren?

51:13.612 --> 51:15.785
- Nice to meet you.
- You, too.

51:15.864 --> 51:17.866
Nice to see you again.

51:20.661 --> 51:23.039
You like Italian food?

51:23.122 --> 51:26.922
I know, it's late and you've
probably got other plans,

51:27.001 --> 51:30.881
but if you'd like to grab some dinner,
we can run right out and catch a cab.

51:30.963 --> 51:34.513
I know a place that has
the greatest cannelloni.

51:36.135 --> 51:38.604
No, I can't.

51:38.679 --> 51:40.602
- You married?
- No.

51:40.681 --> 51:43.605
- Girlfriend?
- No.

51:43.684 --> 51:49.111
I can't go out with you.

51:52.443 --> 51:55.993
God. I'm so sorry.

51:56.071 --> 51:57.539
I am so sorry.

51:57.615 --> 52:00.414
I must come off like a
complete nut job or something.

52:00.492 --> 52:03.792
- No.
- I didn't want to eat alone.

52:03.871 --> 52:05.873
Wet floor.

52:06.498 --> 52:08.967
- No, I...
- You don't have to explain.

52:16.634 --> 52:17.931
Nadia.

52:18.010 --> 52:23.437
In New York restaurant,
what cost is cantaloni?

52:23.515 --> 52:25.517
I don't know. Maybe 15 bucks.

52:25.601 --> 52:27.820
- Dollars?
- Twenty.

52:27.895 --> 52:30.068
Two people, 40.

52:30.147 --> 52:32.149
Two people, 40 dollars.

52:40.574 --> 52:43.544
Two people, 40 dollars.

52:49.249 --> 52:51.001
I help you?

52:52.920 --> 52:56.390
I'm so sorry, sir. The position
has already been filled.

53:03.097 --> 53:06.897
- Do you live nearby?
- Yes. Gate 67.

53:06.975 --> 53:12.197
Because we are very particular about
punctual... Did you say Gate 67?

53:12.272 --> 53:14.195
Gate 67.

53:18.153 --> 53:20.155
You got to be kidding.

53:20.614 --> 53:24.915
You got to help me help you. I don't
see a Social Security number...

53:24.993 --> 53:27.712
mailing address,
even a phone number.

53:27.788 --> 53:32.669
Telephone? You need?
I get. I get. I get phone.

53:32.751 --> 53:34.753
I get phone.

53:44.805 --> 53:45.417
451-1226.

53:49.935 --> 53:52.984
All right. When's the
best time to reach you?

53:54.898 --> 53:55.990
Now?

54:27.723 --> 54:30.226
- Hello?
<i>- Hi, Mr. Navorski.</i>

54:30.309 --> 54:32.858
Yes, this is Viktor Navorski.
Who calls?

54:32.936 --> 54:35.530
<i>It's Cliff from the
Discovery Store.</i>

54:35.606 --> 54:37.825
Ah! Cliff. Hello.

54:37.900 --> 54:39.527
<i>- How's it going?</i>
- Good.

54:39.610 --> 54:43.240
<i>- Is this a good time?</i>
- Yes, I wait for your call all day.

54:43.322 --> 54:46.952
<i>Well, I got to tell you that
the position's been filled.</i>

54:47.034 --> 54:50.789
<i>Yeah, so could you please
go sit someplace else?</i>

54:50.871 --> 54:53.715
<i>- I go to bathroom now.</i>
- That'd be good.

54:53.791 --> 54:55.088
- All right.
- Thank you.

54:55.167 --> 54:56.669
Okay.

56:24.756 --> 56:26.633
Who is this?

56:27.467 --> 56:29.936
- Who are you?
- It's no one.

56:30.012 --> 56:33.607
There's no one here for two weeks.
This isn't one of my guys.

56:37.144 --> 56:41.695
Look at this cornicing.
This is good work.

56:41.773 --> 56:44.822
Must be Harry's crew.
You with Harry's crew?

56:44.902 --> 56:46.700
Does Harry think he's
running this job?

56:46.778 --> 56:48.906
- I go now.
- Go where?

56:48.989 --> 56:51.742
- Gate 67.
- 67?

56:51.825 --> 56:53.827
We're ten months away from 67.

56:53.911 --> 56:57.586
He's got to be Harry's. If he's
not mine, and he's not yours...

56:57.664 --> 56:59.917
Harry's trying to make me look bad.

57:00.000 --> 57:02.503
I've got to slow him down
before he gets to 67.

57:02.586 --> 57:05.430
- What's your name?
- Viktor Navorski.

57:06.506 --> 57:08.850
Pull him off Harry's
crew, put him on mine.

57:08.926 --> 57:11.179
You start 6:30 Monday morning.

57:11.261 --> 57:13.434
You give me job?

57:15.807 --> 57:17.809
6:30, yes, boss.

57:58.183 --> 58:01.278
We have lobster ravioli
from Alitalia.

58:01.353 --> 58:04.027
We have caviar from
Russian Aeroflot.

58:04.106 --> 58:05.483
Okay. Just bring it.

58:05.565 --> 58:08.364
- Hey, Viktor.
- Hello, all.

58:08.443 --> 58:11.868
Look. The man without a country.

58:11.947 --> 58:13.870
Come on in. Welcome.

58:13.949 --> 58:16.577
- I see this.
- You did well.

58:17.369 --> 58:18.461
Have a seat.

58:18.537 --> 58:19.834
- Here?
- Here.

58:19.913 --> 58:21.165
Come on, sit down.

58:21.248 --> 58:25.845
- Who invited him?
- I did. We needed a fourth, right?

58:25.919 --> 58:29.014
- I'm not going to play with him.
- Oh, Gupta, relax, would you?

58:29.089 --> 58:32.093
- He isn't a spy.
- How do you know?

58:32.175 --> 58:36.931
He could be recording everything
we say. A wire in his shirt.

58:37.014 --> 58:39.267
A microphone up in his ass.

58:40.559 --> 58:44.109
- I'm not going to lose my job.
- Fine.

58:45.439 --> 58:48.192
- What if we x-rayed him?
- Yes.

58:49.901 --> 58:51.903
Close your eyes.

59:01.997 --> 59:06.002
- Okay. So you are clean.
- Good. Let's play cards.

59:06.084 --> 59:09.554
I will have money. But Friday.

59:09.629 --> 59:10.596
Don't worry about it.

59:10.672 --> 59:13.801
We play for unclaimed items
from the Lost and Found.

59:13.884 --> 59:17.229
You'll be amazed at what people
leave at airports. Come.

59:17.304 --> 59:20.558
I have two nines and two nines.

59:20.640 --> 59:22.642
Four nines.

59:24.102 --> 59:26.025
- Careful, careful.
- Watch out.

59:26.104 --> 59:27.276
Wait.

59:27.355 --> 59:30.279
We have a question for you, Viktor.

59:30.358 --> 59:32.406
Yeah, we're just curious.

59:32.486 --> 59:33.988
What is in the can?

59:34.071 --> 59:37.245
- What? This?
- Yeah, we saw the x-ray.

59:37.324 --> 59:39.326
We know there's no nuts in there.

59:40.327 --> 59:42.295
What is in there?

59:42.370 --> 59:44.372
This is jazz.

59:45.290 --> 59:47.133
- Jazz?
- Jazz, yes.

59:47.209 --> 59:49.007
- Jazz?
- Yes.

59:51.421 --> 59:55.096
You sure it's jazz in there?
It might be the blues.

59:55.175 --> 59:57.473
- Or salsa.
- Maybe it's Stevie Wonder.

59:57.552 --> 01:00:00.431
- No, no, is jazz.
- Okay, guys. Okay.

01:00:00.514 --> 01:00:02.983
For tonight's grand
prize, we have...

01:00:05.018 --> 01:00:06.736
Show them, Gupta.

01:00:06.812 --> 01:00:08.780
I found this upstairs.

01:00:08.855 --> 01:00:11.529
Virgin Air, first class lounge.

01:00:11.608 --> 01:00:13.610
There you go.

01:00:14.277 --> 01:00:16.154
And they belong to?

01:00:16.238 --> 01:00:19.492
- Cher.
- Cher?

01:00:19.574 --> 01:00:22.453
- As in Cher?
- Yeah. Cher.

01:00:22.536 --> 01:00:24.504
I checked it out.
There were witnesses.

01:00:24.579 --> 01:00:27.298
Those are Cher's panties.

01:00:27.374 --> 01:00:29.126
- Ready?
- Hurry up

01:00:29.209 --> 01:00:31.928
So, will we share the panties?

01:00:32.003 --> 01:00:33.300
- No, no, no.
- Not if I win.

01:00:33.380 --> 01:00:35.382
- Come on.
- Wait a second.

01:00:36.508 --> 01:00:40.354
<i>Flight number 801 to Narita</i>

01:00:40.428 --> 01:00:42.931
<i>is now announcing final boarding...</i>

01:00:43.014 --> 01:00:46.393
"You can't. That is mine."

01:00:48.478 --> 01:00:51.152
"You can get so confused."

01:00:51.231 --> 01:00:54.201
Viktor? Well, hi.

01:00:55.485 --> 01:00:56.486
Please.

01:00:56.570 --> 01:00:58.572
- How are you?
- Good.

01:01:00.574 --> 01:01:05.171
I am so sorry about what happened
last time, asking you out like that.

01:01:05.245 --> 01:01:08.089
I'm so used to guys trying to
grab my ass at 30,000 feet

01:01:08.165 --> 01:01:12.420
that when I meet somebody that
doesn't, I don't know how to react.

01:01:12.961 --> 01:01:15.134
- Let's just start over.
- Yes, okay.

01:01:15.213 --> 01:01:17.932
- Are you coming or going?
- I don't know. Both.

01:01:18.008 --> 01:01:21.353
- Tell me about it.
- Napoleon?

01:01:21.428 --> 01:01:25.058
Yeah. I read a lot of history books.
They're long and cheap

01:01:25.140 --> 01:01:27.359
and usually about men
killing each other.

01:01:27.434 --> 01:01:31.029
Like 1,200 pages for $9.99.
You can't beat that.

01:01:31.104 --> 01:01:34.529
- But Napoleon?
- Yeah. He's one of my favorites.

01:01:35.567 --> 01:01:38.070
- You know what saved Napoleon's life?
- No.

01:01:38.153 --> 01:01:39.530
- His ego.
- Ego?

01:01:39.613 --> 01:01:40.614
Yes.

01:01:40.697 --> 01:01:43.166
After he loses the
Battle of Waterloo,

01:01:43.241 --> 01:01:47.337
Napoleon isolates himself on the
tiny island of Saint Helena.

01:01:47.412 --> 01:01:50.040
No one knows exactly
what happens next,

01:01:50.123 --> 01:01:53.297
but the version
I like goes like this.

01:01:53.376 --> 01:01:56.755
He's very depressed and
decides to take his own life.

01:01:57.547 --> 01:02:01.597
But Napoleon believes himself to
be of such superhuman strength

01:02:01.676 --> 01:02:05.601
that he takes six times the amount
of poison needed to do the job.

01:02:05.680 --> 01:02:10.402
His stomach is so full up with
poison that his body rejects it,

01:02:10.477 --> 01:02:12.229
and he doesn't die.

01:02:12.312 --> 01:02:15.657
See? Ego. Saved his life.

01:02:15.732 --> 01:02:17.780
Maybe he need glasses.

01:02:17.859 --> 01:02:20.863
- Glasses?
- Yes. To read words on bottle.

01:02:20.946 --> 01:02:22.948
Poison.

01:02:24.658 --> 01:02:27.127
It's funny you should say that.

01:02:27.202 --> 01:02:29.876
Rumor has it that
Napoleon was farsighted.

01:02:29.955 --> 01:02:31.673
- There you go.
- There you go.

01:02:31.748 --> 01:02:34.547
- There you go.
- And there you go.

01:02:34.626 --> 01:02:37.550
I think we're rewriting
history right here.

01:02:37.629 --> 01:02:40.223
Why don't we talk
about it over lunch?

01:02:40.715 --> 01:02:43.719
I can't believe it. I just
asked you out again.

01:02:43.802 --> 01:02:45.770
I just did it again.

01:02:47.681 --> 01:02:50.309
I'm so... Just stay away
from me, Viktor, okay?

01:02:50.392 --> 01:02:54.272
I'm sick. I don't have the ability
to be alone for five seconds.

01:02:54.354 --> 01:02:55.355
Okay.

01:02:56.481 --> 01:02:58.950
- Okay, what?
- Okay.

01:02:59.025 --> 01:03:01.119
Lunch with you.

01:03:02.612 --> 01:03:04.489
- You'll have lunch with me?
- Yes.

01:03:04.572 --> 01:03:07.121
You're not running
for a flight or...

01:03:07.200 --> 01:03:08.543
I wait.

01:03:12.497 --> 01:03:14.670
- It's me.
- You. Yes.

01:03:14.749 --> 01:03:17.252
I'm sorry. I just got paged.

01:03:17.335 --> 01:03:20.509
- You work?
- No.

01:03:20.797 --> 01:03:21.798
Ah.

01:03:21.881 --> 01:03:24.760
Three of you. Crowded.

01:03:24.843 --> 01:03:27.266
Stay away from me, Viktor.

01:03:28.388 --> 01:03:32.234
I'm... I have a serious problem.
I'm as bad as Napoleon.

01:03:32.309 --> 01:03:36.234
I just keep ingesting these poisonous
men until I make myself sick.

01:03:36.313 --> 01:03:39.487
You're not sick, Amelia. No.

01:03:39.566 --> 01:03:42.820
No. You're farsighted.

01:03:46.239 --> 01:03:48.867
- I have to go.
- I have to stay.

01:03:49.492 --> 01:03:52.086
- Story of my life.
- Oh! Me, too.

01:04:08.928 --> 01:04:11.181
Your CBP inspection's
in three days.

01:04:11.264 --> 01:04:14.188
The FBI and Homeland Security
will tour the airport,

01:04:14.267 --> 01:04:19.319
spend two hours observing these offices
before your interview process begins.

01:04:19.939 --> 01:04:22.067
How much does Navorski make?

01:04:23.318 --> 01:04:24.535
Sir?

01:04:24.611 --> 01:04:27.990
How much does he make?
How much are they paying him?

01:04:28.698 --> 01:04:31.451
They're paying him
cash under the table.

01:04:31.534 --> 01:04:34.162
I know that. How much?

01:04:34.788 --> 01:04:36.836
$19 an hour.

01:04:36.915 --> 01:04:41.091
Unbelievable. Do you know
that's more than I make?

01:04:41.169 --> 01:04:43.297
That's New York City construction.

01:04:44.506 --> 01:04:47.225
One of my own men came
up to me the other day.

01:04:47.300 --> 01:04:49.849
Asked me if I wanted
to join the big pool.

01:04:49.928 --> 01:04:51.521
Look at him.

01:04:51.596 --> 01:04:54.850
Place a bet on when Navorski's
going to leave this airport.

01:04:54.933 --> 01:04:56.935
Have you heard about this?

01:04:58.853 --> 01:05:00.855
I have January 3rd.

01:05:05.235 --> 01:05:07.237
Bring him in.

01:05:07.320 --> 01:05:10.915
Jake, he has no nationality.
Okay? No country.

01:05:10.990 --> 01:05:15.917
He's a national security risk, according
to my interpretation of Section 2.12.

01:05:15.995 --> 01:05:20.045
I want you to put him in a detention
center and run a clearance on him.

01:05:20.125 --> 01:05:22.127
That's all I want.

01:05:23.711 --> 01:05:25.713
Well, what about a federal prison?

01:05:26.965 --> 01:05:29.844
Well, what about another airport?

01:05:29.926 --> 01:05:32.520
Hello? Hello?

01:05:35.974 --> 01:05:39.478
We're detaining so many people,
there's no room anywhere.

01:05:39.978 --> 01:05:44.484
- Did you try the FBI?
- I tried everybody. Nobody'll take him.

01:05:44.566 --> 01:05:46.944
You want me to bring him
back to the terminal?

01:05:47.026 --> 01:05:50.496
No. From now on,
Navorski lives here.

01:06:00.165 --> 01:06:02.588
The people who are
coming here today

01:06:02.667 --> 01:06:06.422
will be observing
me, inspecting me.

01:06:07.338 --> 01:06:10.968
But most of all they will be looking
at the way that this airport is run.

01:06:11.050 --> 01:06:13.144
So let's show them why this is

01:06:13.219 --> 01:06:16.314
the number one airport
in the United States.

01:06:16.890 --> 01:06:19.814
We process about 600 planes a day,

01:06:19.893 --> 01:06:22.612
with a processing time
of 37 minutes per plane,

01:06:22.687 --> 01:06:24.655
about 60 seconds per passenger...

01:06:24.731 --> 01:06:27.405
to be brought into the country.

01:06:27.484 --> 01:06:30.784
We keep it as clean as possible.

01:06:30.862 --> 01:06:33.331
- What do you import?
- Computer software.

01:06:33.406 --> 01:06:34.749
That's a lot of walnuts.

01:06:34.824 --> 01:06:37.919
Yeah. My mother-in-law
loves these things.

01:06:37.994 --> 01:06:40.747
Every time I go to Brazil,
I bring her back a bag.

01:06:40.830 --> 01:06:42.878
- Your mother-in-law?
- Yeah.

01:06:43.500 --> 01:06:45.502
Mind if I try one?

01:06:55.094 --> 01:06:58.189
How did you know those weren't
for his mother-in-law?

01:06:58.264 --> 01:06:59.982
If he's married, where's his ring?

01:07:00.058 --> 01:07:03.028
And if he's divorced, who still
talks to their mother-in-law?

01:07:04.187 --> 01:07:07.862
I'm sorry, but really. No offense
to mother-in-laws, but...

01:07:07.941 --> 01:07:09.818
- Sir.
- Yeah.

01:07:11.361 --> 01:07:13.705
Sir, we have a situation upstairs.

01:07:13.780 --> 01:07:16.283
- It'll have to wait.
- No. This won't wait.

01:07:16.366 --> 01:07:18.368
When the 9:12 from Toronto landed,

01:07:18.451 --> 01:07:20.874
they found four prescriptions
without an MPL.

01:07:20.954 --> 01:07:23.582
They tried to take the pills
away, and he went nuts.

01:07:23.665 --> 01:07:26.418
There he is. We think
they're for his father.

01:07:26.501 --> 01:07:29.380
Sir, sir, calm down.
Put your weapons down.

01:07:29.462 --> 01:07:33.467
Everybody keep your weapons...
All right. We're here to help you.

01:07:33.550 --> 01:07:36.679
We're here to help you, sir.
All right. Give me the knife.

01:07:36.761 --> 01:07:38.479
- Where's he from?
- Russia.

01:07:38.555 --> 01:07:41.274
The only interpreter
we got is in Newark.

01:07:41.349 --> 01:07:44.853
- We have to get someone to talk to him.
- I have an idea, sir.

01:07:48.314 --> 01:07:49.987
Viktor.

01:07:51.025 --> 01:07:52.026
Viktor.

01:07:55.822 --> 01:07:57.824
I need your help.

01:07:59.117 --> 01:08:01.996
His name is Milodragovich.
He lives near you.

01:08:02.078 --> 01:08:03.796
He may not speak your dialect,

01:08:03.871 --> 01:08:06.420
but I need you to translate
and help me out.

01:08:06.499 --> 01:08:09.252
- I help you? Why?
- I don't want anybody to get hurt.

01:08:09.335 --> 01:08:10.552
This guy's very upset.

01:08:10.628 --> 01:08:13.973
Just calm him down, and I'll
let you back in the terminal.

01:08:14.048 --> 01:08:17.723
No. New York. No red stamp.
Green. I green.

01:08:17.801 --> 01:08:18.928
- New York.
- Okay, yes.

01:08:19.011 --> 01:08:21.014
- You say yes?
- Yes.

01:08:23.765 --> 01:08:27.987
We have somebody here to talk to you.
Somebody to talk to you. Go ahead.

01:08:28.062 --> 01:08:30.439
Stay out.

01:08:46.788 --> 01:08:48.006
So?

01:08:48.541 --> 01:08:53.763
Okay, tell him in order to export
medicines from this country,

01:08:53.837 --> 01:08:55.385
he needs to have the proper form,

01:08:55.465 --> 01:09:00.345
he needs to have a Medicinal
Purchase License.

01:09:00.428 --> 01:09:02.350
Okay? You understand me, Viktor?

01:09:24.035 --> 01:09:29.006
He say he bring the
medicine for his father.

01:09:34.587 --> 01:09:38.808
This why he go to Canada.
Medicine for father.

01:09:38.883 --> 01:09:40.055
It doesn't matter.

01:09:40.134 --> 01:09:45.106
His plane landed in the U.S.
He needs to have the right form.

01:09:57.068 --> 01:09:59.491
He did not know he
need this document.

01:09:59.570 --> 01:10:01.698
No one say to him he
need document form.

01:10:01.781 --> 01:10:03.033
I'm saying it to him.

01:10:03.116 --> 01:10:08.623
He needs to have the form signed by the
hospital who is treating his father.

01:10:08.705 --> 01:10:11.754
These medicines have to
stay in the United States.

01:10:11.833 --> 01:10:13.130
They have to stay here.

01:10:32.729 --> 01:10:36.108
- He's begging you.
- I know. I can see that he's begging.

01:10:40.528 --> 01:10:41.905
I'm sorry, sir.

01:10:43.072 --> 01:10:48.169
You'll have to take a flight in the
morning. The medicine stays here.

01:10:49.245 --> 01:10:51.293
I'm sorry.

01:10:54.876 --> 01:10:56.799
Send him down.

01:11:02.091 --> 01:11:04.970
Thank you, Viktor.
Good job. Let's go.

01:11:10.183 --> 01:11:12.356
Oh, oh, oh, hey. Uh...

01:11:12.769 --> 01:11:13.895
Goat.

01:11:14.771 --> 01:11:19.527
- What?
- Goat. Medicine is for goat.

01:11:20.234 --> 01:11:25.035
- Goat?
- Yes. Medicine is for goat. Goat.

01:11:27.283 --> 01:11:29.786
- He said that?
- Yes.

01:11:29.869 --> 01:11:31.792
He say...

01:11:31.871 --> 01:11:35.842
We not understand.
I not understand "goat."

01:11:36.667 --> 01:11:39.716
Why? What are you saying?
You misunderstood him?

01:11:39.796 --> 01:11:43.016
- It's not for his dying father?
- No. No.

01:11:43.090 --> 01:11:48.847
The... Krakozhia...
The name for "father"

01:11:48.930 --> 01:11:51.274
sound like "goat."

01:11:51.349 --> 01:11:53.351
I make mistake.

01:12:01.567 --> 01:12:03.786
Why are you doing this, Viktor?

01:12:03.861 --> 01:12:07.081
Medicine is for goat.

01:12:07.698 --> 01:12:08.950
- No, it's not.
- Yes.

01:12:11.410 --> 01:12:13.754
You read the blue immigration form.

01:12:13.830 --> 01:12:14.831
- Blue?
- Yes. Blue.

01:12:14.914 --> 01:12:16.541
- Blue?
- Blue. The blue form.

01:12:16.624 --> 01:12:19.924
The one that says if it's an animal,
he doesn't need the license.

01:12:20.002 --> 01:12:23.802
Then he can bring the drugs in. That's
good, Viktor. That's very good.

01:12:26.592 --> 01:12:28.811
Why are you doing this? Huh?

01:12:29.303 --> 01:12:32.273
You don't know him.
You don't know the rules.

01:12:32.348 --> 01:12:34.646
Look at me.

01:12:34.725 --> 01:12:36.727
I was going to help you.

01:12:38.646 --> 01:12:42.526
Now I want you to
ask him... No, not you.

01:12:42.608 --> 01:12:45.578
I want you to ask him.
I want to hear him say it.

01:12:45.653 --> 01:12:49.624
I want to hear him say
who the medicine is for.

01:12:49.699 --> 01:12:52.669
Please. Who the medicine is for.

01:13:02.712 --> 01:13:06.888
Answer him, Mr. Milodragovich.
Who are the pills for?

01:13:13.431 --> 01:13:16.401
Okay. The pills stay.
He goes. That's it.

01:13:21.939 --> 01:13:23.941
Goat.

01:13:24.525 --> 01:13:26.402
Please. For goat.

01:13:27.445 --> 01:13:29.868
Medicine for goat.

01:13:29.947 --> 01:13:32.370
Medicine for goat.

01:13:32.450 --> 01:13:34.418
Medicine for goat.

01:13:36.370 --> 01:13:37.997
Give him the pills.

01:13:39.332 --> 01:13:41.334
Medicine for goat.

01:13:42.752 --> 01:13:44.754
Medicine...

01:13:57.099 --> 01:13:59.101
He love that goat.

01:14:02.813 --> 01:14:05.783
Do you think I need an excuse
to put you back in that cell

01:14:05.858 --> 01:14:07.826
to keep you there for five years?

01:14:07.902 --> 01:14:11.202
You go to war with me, and you go
to war with the United States.

01:14:11.280 --> 01:14:15.205
Then you'll know why Krakozhians
wait in line for cheap toilet paper

01:14:15.284 --> 01:14:18.754
while Uncle Sam wipes his
ass with Charmin two-ply.

01:14:27.546 --> 01:14:30.140
<i>There was a 20 man.</i>

01:14:30.216 --> 01:14:33.060
<i>Immigration gun was drawn.</i>

01:14:33.135 --> 01:14:36.059
The Dixon was ready to fire.

01:14:36.138 --> 01:14:38.891
To kill the little
man with the pills.

01:14:39.934 --> 01:14:45.316
But then someone walks into the room
and stand in front of this little man.

01:14:46.107 --> 01:14:49.782
"Put the guns away," the man say.

01:14:49.860 --> 01:14:52.158
"Nobody will die today."

01:14:52.238 --> 01:14:53.239
Who?

01:14:54.156 --> 01:14:57.035
- Who was it that saved him?
- Yeah, tell us. Who was it?

01:14:57.118 --> 01:14:59.120
Who was this man?

01:15:05.042 --> 01:15:09.172
Navorski. Viktor
"The Goat" Navorski.

01:15:37.825 --> 01:15:41.830
- It doesn't look good, Frank.
- I was just following the rules.

01:15:41.912 --> 01:15:46.713
Sometimes you have to ignore the
rules and concentrate on the people.

01:15:46.792 --> 01:15:48.044
The people, I know.

01:15:48.127 --> 01:15:51.973
The people, compassion. That's
the foundation of this country.

01:15:54.258 --> 01:15:56.852
You could learn something
from Navorski.

01:15:58.804 --> 01:16:01.853
Cheer up. It's not over yet.

01:16:28.334 --> 01:16:30.336
- Is that for me?
- Yes. Yes.

01:16:30.961 --> 01:16:34.340
Is Virgin Isle sailfish.

01:16:35.633 --> 01:16:37.385
For you.

01:16:37.468 --> 01:16:39.470
For you.

01:16:40.012 --> 01:16:42.014
For wall.

01:16:42.973 --> 01:16:44.975
Fish for wall.

01:16:51.273 --> 01:16:53.492
Why do you want to go to New York?

01:16:54.527 --> 01:16:56.871
And what's in the can of peanuts?

01:17:00.157 --> 01:17:01.750
Promise.

01:17:02.618 --> 01:17:05.246
- A promise in the can?
- Yes. A promise.

01:17:07.957 --> 01:17:10.460
Let me make you a promise, Viktor.

01:17:10.543 --> 01:17:14.138
And this is a promise that comes
from a man who is stuck here.

01:17:14.213 --> 01:17:17.183
A man who may be stuck here
for the next ten years.

01:17:20.177 --> 01:17:24.182
From now on, you and
I are partners.

01:17:25.224 --> 01:17:28.353
If I stay, you stay.

01:17:28.435 --> 01:17:32.565
You will not set one
foot in New York City.

01:17:33.524 --> 01:17:37.574
Not a single toe in the
United States of America.

01:17:38.904 --> 01:17:41.703
Do you understand what
I am saying to you?

01:17:42.908 --> 01:17:44.410
Yes.

01:17:45.786 --> 01:17:47.663
You don't like fish.

01:18:08.934 --> 01:18:12.780
Do you ever feel like you're
just living in an airport?

01:18:19.737 --> 01:18:23.537
We don't have to do this, Viktor.
I can ship you out in a crate.

01:18:23.616 --> 01:18:25.914
I can mail you anywhere in the U.S.

01:18:25.993 --> 01:18:29.372
What about my food cart? He can
hide inside, and we'll drive out.

01:18:29.455 --> 01:18:33.551
- No. I can't do this.
- You said you wanted us to help you.

01:18:33.626 --> 01:18:35.720
- I do.
- What's her name?

01:18:35.794 --> 01:18:37.216
Amelia Warren.

01:18:37.296 --> 01:18:40.175
I thought we were looking for
a way out, not a way in.

01:18:40.257 --> 01:18:43.682
Be careful. Those flight attendants
ain't like regular women.

01:18:43.761 --> 01:18:46.059
Flying back and forth
between time zones

01:18:46.138 --> 01:18:48.232
messes with their biological clock.

01:18:48.307 --> 01:18:52.403
- They're always ready for sex.
- Okay, I found something.

01:18:52.478 --> 01:18:56.574
I am leaving.
They will come for us.

01:18:56.649 --> 01:18:59.243
Gupta, will you relax?
Just watch the door.

01:18:59.318 --> 01:19:02.242
You go in jail. Not me.

01:19:02.321 --> 01:19:04.244
For... You know what? Forget it.

01:19:04.323 --> 01:19:06.166
- Keep looking.
- Warren, right?

01:19:06.242 --> 01:19:08.040
- Yes. Yes.
- Warren.

01:19:08.118 --> 01:19:09.620
Amelia Jane Warren?

01:19:09.703 --> 01:19:11.705
- Jane?
- Yeah.

01:19:14.041 --> 01:19:15.918
Way to go, Viktor. First class.

01:19:16.001 --> 01:19:18.971
- When she come back?
- Three weeks.

01:20:01.088 --> 01:20:04.388
Amelia, would you like
to get eat to bite?

01:20:06.552 --> 01:20:10.227
Bite to eat? Cantaloni?

01:20:20.441 --> 01:20:22.193
Bite to eat?

01:20:26.196 --> 01:20:27.948
Bite to eat?

01:20:31.577 --> 01:20:34.456
Eat to bite? Eat to bite.

01:20:34.538 --> 01:20:39.169
Bite to eat. Bite to eat.
Bite to eat.

01:20:54.308 --> 01:20:57.733
Gupta, you been ever married?

01:20:58.854 --> 01:21:01.949
- What did you say?
- You been ever married?

01:21:02.024 --> 01:21:07.906
I had a wife and two kids in India.
I left them there 23 years ago.

01:21:07.988 --> 01:21:09.706
Why?

01:21:10.491 --> 01:21:14.712
I had a small tobacco
shop in Madras.

01:21:14.787 --> 01:21:17.165
Made just enough money to survive.

01:21:17.247 --> 01:21:22.378
One day this policeman comes in
and tells me I owe him some tax.

01:21:22.461 --> 01:21:26.807
I said okay. This is common.
So I pay him.

01:21:26.882 --> 01:21:31.729
The next day, the same policeman come
and keep coming and keep coming.

01:21:31.804 --> 01:21:35.775
And I am paying, and I'm paying him,
and I'm paying him, and I'm paying him.

01:21:35.849 --> 01:21:41.447
And finally, on the fifth day, I take
a knife and I stab him in his chest.

01:21:42.147 --> 01:21:45.947
- You killed policeman?
- No. I just missed his heart.

01:21:46.985 --> 01:21:49.488
When they tried to arrest me,
I run away.

01:21:50.114 --> 01:21:52.742
So you never go home?

01:21:52.825 --> 01:21:57.456
If I go home, I go in the
jail for seven years.

01:21:59.957 --> 01:22:04.679
What if United States
catch you? They deport you.

01:22:05.838 --> 01:22:10.344
As long as I keep my floor
clean, keep my head down,

01:22:11.051 --> 01:22:13.429
they have no reason to deport me.

01:22:13.512 --> 01:22:16.686
They have no reason to
notice a man like me.

01:22:18.225 --> 01:22:21.479
<i>United Airlines Flight
2703 from Rome, Italy,</i>

01:22:21.562 --> 01:22:24.862
<i>is now arriving at Gate C43.</i>

01:22:32.865 --> 01:22:35.744
- Hey, wait.
- Sorry. I'm sorry.

01:22:40.581 --> 01:22:42.583
No, no, no. It's wet.

01:22:47.713 --> 01:22:50.091
- Hey.
- Watch where you're going.

01:22:50.174 --> 01:22:52.176
Watch out.

01:22:56.054 --> 01:22:57.806
- Amelia.
- Viktor.

01:22:57.890 --> 01:23:00.860
- Hello.
- Sorry. I'm sorry.

01:23:00.934 --> 01:23:02.652
He nearly killed me.

01:23:02.728 --> 01:23:04.730
- You okay?
- I'm fine.

01:23:06.565 --> 01:23:08.943
I love the suit.

01:23:09.026 --> 01:23:10.778
Hugo Boss.

01:23:10.861 --> 01:23:13.330
On sale, $149.99.

01:23:13.864 --> 01:23:16.162
That's a bargain.

01:23:16.241 --> 01:23:18.335
- Napoleon?
- Yes, yes.

01:23:18.410 --> 01:23:20.287
And Josephine.

01:23:20.370 --> 01:23:23.499
Do you know what Napoleon gave
Josephine on their wedding day?

01:23:23.582 --> 01:23:25.380
Amelia?

01:23:25.459 --> 01:23:30.010
Would you like to have eat to bite?

01:23:30.088 --> 01:23:31.840
Food. Tonight?

01:23:31.924 --> 01:23:34.552
- You're asking me out for dinner?
- Yes.

01:23:34.635 --> 01:23:36.478
Yeah. Sure.

01:23:36.553 --> 01:23:39.102
- What time?
- Dinnertime.

01:23:40.015 --> 01:23:43.064
- Where do you want to go?
- I know place.

01:23:53.403 --> 01:23:56.782
- Do you have an appointment?
- Navorski.

01:23:58.450 --> 01:24:00.452
This way, please.

01:24:09.628 --> 01:24:11.630
Thank you.

01:24:13.549 --> 01:24:16.177
I didn't know they
had a patio up here.

01:24:16.969 --> 01:24:18.971
It's very nice.

01:24:38.115 --> 01:24:40.117
Good night.

01:24:44.496 --> 01:24:45.839
Please.

01:24:46.957 --> 01:24:51.383
Sorry. So, tonight we have
cannellonis or chicken.

01:24:51.461 --> 01:24:54.260
- Cannelloni, please.
- Cannelloni.

01:24:54.339 --> 01:24:56.433
- Sorry.
- Thank you.

01:24:56.508 --> 01:24:58.260
For you, sir?

01:24:58.343 --> 01:25:01.563
- Same.
- That's a great, great choice.

01:25:01.638 --> 01:25:03.640
I'll be back.

01:25:17.821 --> 01:25:21.200
Let me see. Enjoy.

01:25:22.784 --> 01:25:25.663
Did you know the croissant
was invented in Romania?

01:25:25.746 --> 01:25:27.840
- Tell me.
- Okay.

01:25:28.665 --> 01:25:32.386
It's 1742, and the Turks
invade Bucharest,

01:25:32.461 --> 01:25:35.590
making a surprise attack
under the cover of night.

01:25:35.672 --> 01:25:37.674
But the town bakers...

01:25:39.968 --> 01:25:41.561
Sorry.

01:25:58.862 --> 01:26:01.160
So, the bakers?

01:26:01.239 --> 01:26:05.836
- No, never mind. It's a dumb story.
- No, please.

01:26:05.911 --> 01:26:07.163
I'm sorry, Viktor.

01:26:07.245 --> 01:26:11.045
Nobody really cares where
the croissant was invented.

01:26:11.124 --> 01:26:14.048
I'll bet the Romanians
themselves don't give a shit.

01:26:14.670 --> 01:26:16.138
I care.

01:26:16.213 --> 01:26:19.183
Is histories. Is truth.

01:26:20.258 --> 01:26:22.761
- I'm 39 years old.
- No.

01:26:23.929 --> 01:26:25.397
- Yeah.
- No.

01:26:25.472 --> 01:26:28.442
- That's the truth.
- You are not.

01:26:28.517 --> 01:26:34.240
I tell everybody I'm 33, and most of the
men I've dated think I'm 27, but no.

01:26:34.314 --> 01:26:36.612
I'm 39.

01:26:36.692 --> 01:26:39.115
So? I was 39 once.

01:26:40.612 --> 01:26:44.037
I was 18 years old when I started
working for the airlines.

01:26:44.116 --> 01:26:46.744
I've been doing this over 20 years.

01:26:46.827 --> 01:26:49.501
And now there's no more pretending.

01:26:49.579 --> 01:26:51.422
This is it.

01:26:51.498 --> 01:26:56.550
It's why my address book is by city,
and my pager goes off during dinner.

01:27:00.132 --> 01:27:03.557
You can switch off pager.

01:27:04.469 --> 01:27:06.142
I wish I could.

01:27:06.221 --> 01:27:09.896
I've been waiting for a
phone call for seven years.

01:27:09.975 --> 01:27:14.276
I know it's coming, Viktor.
That's why I can't break it off.

01:27:15.063 --> 01:27:19.864
That's why I live out of hotels and have
my little suitcase packed, ready to go,

01:27:19.943 --> 01:27:23.493
just in case he wants to
meet me for the weekend.

01:27:23.572 --> 01:27:25.165
Yeah.

01:27:26.032 --> 01:27:28.330
I've been waiting my whole life.

01:27:31.413 --> 01:27:33.836
Just don't know what the hell for.

01:27:37.878 --> 01:27:39.926
I'm so sorry.

01:27:57.773 --> 01:28:00.276
I live here.

01:28:00.358 --> 01:28:02.611
- What?
- I live here, in terminal.

01:28:02.694 --> 01:28:04.696
Gate 67.

01:28:05.405 --> 01:28:08.579
- You live at the airport?
- Yes. Day and night.

01:28:08.658 --> 01:28:12.253
This home, like you.
They tell me to wait.

01:28:12.329 --> 01:28:14.127
So I wait.

01:28:14.206 --> 01:28:17.085
All frequent fliers feel the
same way you do, Viktor.

01:28:17.167 --> 01:28:19.420
Everybody's waiting. Everybody.

01:28:19.503 --> 01:28:23.599
- For a flight, for a meeting...
- I don't wait for flight or meeting.

01:28:24.424 --> 01:28:26.597
Then what are you waiting for?

01:28:29.721 --> 01:28:32.349
Is okay. I understand.

01:28:36.603 --> 01:28:38.401
I have an idea.

01:28:39.397 --> 01:28:41.991
- Come here.
- What you do?

01:28:44.486 --> 01:28:48.366
- You sure?
- More than anything, I'm sure of this.

01:28:48.448 --> 01:28:50.325
Ready?

01:29:05.841 --> 01:29:08.765
So, when do you come back?

01:29:08.844 --> 01:29:12.098
13 days. How about you?

01:29:12.180 --> 01:29:14.933
I will be here.

01:29:15.016 --> 01:29:17.815
But what if your schedule changes?

01:29:17.894 --> 01:29:20.113
Maybe we should
exchange phone numbers.

01:29:20.188 --> 01:29:23.112
No. I will be here.

01:29:23.775 --> 01:29:28.702
You know what Napoleon give to
Josephine when he win Bavaria?

01:29:29.364 --> 01:29:31.366
Tell me.

01:29:32.075 --> 01:29:33.372
Come on. Tell me.

01:29:33.451 --> 01:29:38.082
I will show you. 13 days from now.

01:30:47.108 --> 01:30:48.360
What's he doing?

01:30:48.443 --> 01:30:52.118
I can't ask him. I'm supposed
to tell him what he's doing.

01:30:52.197 --> 01:30:54.165
If I ask him, I look like an idiot.

01:31:11.800 --> 01:31:16.101
I'm sorry. Sorry. You
got to do this for me.

01:31:16.179 --> 01:31:19.479
You'll get really fat with all
the food I'm going to give you.

01:31:19.557 --> 01:31:24.233
But, please, do this for me. It will
be the last thing I ask you to do.

01:31:42.747 --> 01:31:46.752
He waits for you to
answer at Sbarro.

01:31:51.131 --> 01:31:55.762
- I have to work.
- He will wait.

01:33:00.075 --> 01:33:02.294
- How was your flight?
- Good.

01:33:03.495 --> 01:33:05.497
Thanks.

01:33:09.459 --> 01:33:13.180
- Is something wrong?
- You'll have to come with us.

01:33:13.254 --> 01:33:16.599
You're kidding. I come
through here twice a month.

01:33:16.674 --> 01:33:18.597
Please follow me.

01:33:18.676 --> 01:33:21.145
I'm supposed to be
meeting somebody.

01:33:44.369 --> 01:33:47.293
<i>In my line of work, there are
three things that matter.</i>

01:33:47.372 --> 01:33:52.378
The person, the
document and the story.

01:33:54.295 --> 01:33:58.425
Find the truth of one, and you
find the truth of all three.

01:33:58.508 --> 01:34:01.011
I need your help finding the truth.

01:34:02.679 --> 01:34:05.979
Do you know a man named
Viktor Navorski?

01:34:06.057 --> 01:34:07.559
Yes.

01:34:08.268 --> 01:34:11.317
Do you know why he's here
and where he's from?

01:34:11.396 --> 01:34:14.195
No. We're just friends.

01:34:14.274 --> 01:34:16.618
Have you noticed
that he hides a can

01:34:16.693 --> 01:34:20.414
of dry roasted peanuts in his bag?

01:34:20.488 --> 01:34:23.708
- So?
- What do you make of that?

01:34:25.660 --> 01:34:28.004
I'd make peanut butter, I guess.

01:34:30.123 --> 01:34:34.048
We know that he's planning to go
to the Ramada Inn on Lexington.

01:34:34.127 --> 01:34:37.597
- Has he told you why he's in New York?
- No.

01:34:37.672 --> 01:34:41.552
- Has he told you where he lives?
- No. We just met at the airport.

01:34:41.634 --> 01:34:45.514
All I know is that he's a building
contractor, living out of a suitcase.

01:34:45.597 --> 01:34:47.099
That's it.

01:34:47.182 --> 01:34:49.526
- He's a contractor?
- Yeah.

01:34:49.601 --> 01:34:51.603
That's what he said?

01:34:54.606 --> 01:34:58.531
Amelia. I'm just curious.

01:34:58.610 --> 01:35:02.786
You are the kind of woman who
can get any guy she wants.

01:35:05.491 --> 01:35:07.710
Why Viktor Navorski?

01:35:09.704 --> 01:35:14.301
That's something a guy like
you could never understand.

01:35:37.315 --> 01:35:42.287
I guess you missed your flight again.
Or maybe you have a bad travel agent.

01:35:42.362 --> 01:35:44.490
Please. Sit.

01:35:44.572 --> 01:35:47.576
It's okay, Viktor. All men lie.

01:35:47.659 --> 01:35:51.289
- At least you're not very good at it.
- I did not lie.

01:35:51.371 --> 01:35:55.968
You told me you were delayed. You
never said it was for nine months.

01:35:56.042 --> 01:35:59.387
Maybe you see the man the
way you want see the man.

01:35:59.462 --> 01:36:02.591
So, what am I seeing? Who are you?

01:36:04.300 --> 01:36:06.598
- I...
- Unacceptable?

01:36:06.678 --> 01:36:09.056
Yes. Yes.

01:36:09.138 --> 01:36:11.687
You want to hear the funny part?

01:36:11.766 --> 01:36:13.564
I broke up with him.

01:36:13.643 --> 01:36:16.271
I was coming here to tell
you he's out of my life.

01:36:16.354 --> 01:36:20.325
I'm free. I got tired of waiting.

01:36:20.400 --> 01:36:22.402
At least we have that in common.

01:36:26.990 --> 01:36:32.963
Amelia, you know what Napoleon give
to Josephine when he win Bavaria?

01:36:34.706 --> 01:36:36.333
No.

01:36:36.416 --> 01:36:38.510
I show you.

01:36:43.172 --> 01:36:45.140
Please.

01:36:48.886 --> 01:36:50.888
Sit. Please.

01:37:02.358 --> 01:37:06.955
That was gift.
Napoleon to Josephine.

01:37:07.030 --> 01:37:09.909
One thousand fountains.

01:37:11.617 --> 01:37:13.244
You built this for me?

01:37:13.328 --> 01:37:17.174
Please. Sit. Don't get wet.

01:37:27.884 --> 01:37:29.886
Come on.

01:37:30.928 --> 01:37:32.475
Oh...

01:37:33.514 --> 01:37:34.606
it no work.

01:37:34.682 --> 01:37:39.609
It should shoot, big
water up to ceiling.

01:37:41.272 --> 01:37:46.278
Just tell me the truth. Did you
escape from an institution?

01:37:49.906 --> 01:37:51.908
Are you a criminal?

01:37:54.952 --> 01:37:56.829
You're living here, Viktor.

01:37:56.913 --> 01:38:00.087
You're living at Gate 67.
I just want to know why.

01:38:00.166 --> 01:38:02.168
Here. I show you.

01:38:14.514 --> 01:38:16.391
My father.

01:38:16.474 --> 01:38:19.694
Viktor, please tell me your
father isn't in that peanut can.

01:38:26.984 --> 01:38:28.986
This is jazz.

01:38:35.576 --> 01:38:38.455
My father, Dimitar Asenov Navorski,

01:38:38.538 --> 01:38:43.465
see this photograph in
Hungarian newspaper, 1958.

01:38:44.627 --> 01:38:47.426
He say he look at
photograph for seven days.

01:38:47.505 --> 01:38:49.758
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday...

01:38:49.841 --> 01:38:51.889
Who are they?

01:38:51.968 --> 01:38:55.598
Count Basie, Dizzy Gillespie,
Thelonious Monk, Sonny Rollins,

01:38:55.680 --> 01:38:57.682
Art Blakey, Max Kaminsky.

01:38:57.765 --> 01:39:00.359
57 of them all together.

01:39:00.893 --> 01:39:04.864
After looking at photograph for
seven days, my father has idea.

01:39:04.939 --> 01:39:09.991
He begin to write letters to club,
Lickety Split, Snookie's Sugar Bowl.

01:39:10.361 --> 01:39:15.458
He ask the nuns to write
English. Hundreds letters.

01:39:15.533 --> 01:39:17.535
And then he wait.

01:39:18.453 --> 01:39:22.299
He wait month, week, year.

01:39:22.373 --> 01:39:25.422
My father wait 40 year.

01:39:29.881 --> 01:39:32.350
And they all sign names.

01:39:35.261 --> 01:39:37.355
One by one.

01:39:53.029 --> 01:39:57.751
They all write their name
and send it to my father.

01:40:04.248 --> 01:40:06.250
All but not one.

01:40:08.044 --> 01:40:09.671
Benny Golson.

01:40:13.591 --> 01:40:15.593
Saxophone.

01:40:15.676 --> 01:40:20.933
My father die before Benny Golson
write his name and send to my father.

01:40:21.015 --> 01:40:24.895
So I make him promise.
I keep promise.

01:40:28.773 --> 01:40:34.371
I promise I will go New York,
find Benny Golson,

01:40:34.445 --> 01:40:37.289
have him write name to put in can.

01:40:38.199 --> 01:40:41.999
And you've been living here so you
could do this for your father?

01:40:42.745 --> 01:40:44.964
Maybe I think he do it for me.

01:40:50.795 --> 01:40:54.720
You say you are waiting
for something.

01:40:55.967 --> 01:40:59.892
And I say to you,
"Yes, yes. We all wait."

01:41:03.224 --> 01:41:04.646
What are you waiting for?

01:41:07.478 --> 01:41:11.324
You. I wait for you.

01:42:08.789 --> 01:42:10.041
What?

01:42:14.545 --> 01:42:16.798
The war is over.

01:42:16.881 --> 01:42:19.361
<i>The right wing military coup that
ousted President Vagobagin...</i>

01:42:47.078 --> 01:42:50.378
All right, everybody.
Let's raise your glasses.

01:42:50.456 --> 01:42:54.131
Let's have a toast to my
friend, Viktor "The Goat."

01:42:56.587 --> 01:42:59.010
May he never lose
his country again.

01:42:59.090 --> 01:43:00.888
Krakozhia.

01:43:00.966 --> 01:43:04.891
Amelia. You here early.

01:43:04.970 --> 01:43:07.143
Hello. Amelia, look.

01:43:07.223 --> 01:43:09.897
Peace. Peace. The war. The war.
Please come. Come.

01:43:09.975 --> 01:43:12.945
See, the war, the war
Krakozhia is over.

01:43:13.020 --> 01:43:15.773
Peace. The war is over.

01:43:19.610 --> 01:43:22.864
- You know my friend in Washington.
- Yes, yes.

01:43:22.947 --> 01:43:25.746
He has a lot of connections. Here.

01:43:25.825 --> 01:43:27.577
It's a pass, Viktor.

01:43:27.660 --> 01:43:30.539
A one-day travel emergency
visa with your name on it.

01:43:30.621 --> 01:43:32.464
- Wha... Visa?
- Yes.

01:43:32.540 --> 01:43:34.634
- From your friend?
- Yeah.

01:43:34.709 --> 01:43:38.555
Just go to New York, find that
last name and put it in the can.

01:43:39.588 --> 01:43:40.680
- I go New York?
- Yes.

01:43:40.756 --> 01:43:42.224
I go New York!

01:43:50.266 --> 01:43:53.941
Amelia, you come with. You
come with me to New York.

01:43:56.981 --> 01:44:01.703
Your friend do this for me?
Why he do this for me?

01:44:03.738 --> 01:44:05.706
He did it for me.

01:44:07.700 --> 01:44:11.921
I told you to stay away from me,
Viktor. But you didn't understand.

01:44:11.996 --> 01:44:15.796
- I think you were confused.
- No, I confused about everything.

01:44:15.875 --> 01:44:18.628
I not confused...
Not this. Not this.

01:44:20.755 --> 01:44:24.430
I'm sorry. I'm running late.

01:44:24.508 --> 01:44:27.853
Amelia. Why you go? Why you go?

01:44:29.138 --> 01:44:32.688
You know what Napoleon gave
Josephine as a wedding present?

01:44:32.767 --> 01:44:34.769
It was a gold locket.

01:44:34.852 --> 01:44:38.197
And on the inside,
he made an inscription.

01:44:42.985 --> 01:44:44.987
"Destiny."

01:44:47.656 --> 01:44:49.658
Destiny.

01:44:53.078 --> 01:44:54.079
<i>Rejoice in the streets</i>

01:44:54.163 --> 01:44:55.210
<i>as well as in their local taverns.</i>

01:44:55.289 --> 01:45:00.136
<i>The Krakozhian flag waved goodbye from
high atop the parliament buildings.</i>

01:45:00.211 --> 01:45:02.259
<i>It is a clear sign of the power...</i>

01:45:04.173 --> 01:45:06.801
- Hey, baby.
- Hi.

01:45:07.802 --> 01:45:09.304
I missed you.

01:45:12.389 --> 01:45:14.391
Come on.

01:45:26.904 --> 01:45:28.451
Next.

01:45:29.532 --> 01:45:31.330
Viktor.

01:45:33.077 --> 01:45:36.081
Hello, Dolores. How I am today?

01:45:37.748 --> 01:45:39.796
What do you have here?

01:45:44.046 --> 01:45:46.048
What do you have here?

01:45:55.891 --> 01:45:57.939
Oh, no. It's not signed.

01:45:59.562 --> 01:46:01.314
What?

01:46:01.397 --> 01:46:04.196
This is a one-day
emergency travel visa.

01:46:04.275 --> 01:46:08.906
To validate authenticity, it needs to
be signed by the supervising officer.

01:46:09.405 --> 01:46:10.657
Dixon?

01:46:11.740 --> 01:46:12.866
Yes.

01:46:12.950 --> 01:46:14.452
Dixon.

01:46:18.998 --> 01:46:22.969
The war in my country is over.

01:46:24.169 --> 01:46:27.799
Yeah. I know. Congratulations.

01:46:29.174 --> 01:46:31.176
It's strange, isn't it, Viktor?

01:46:32.303 --> 01:46:34.647
When you wait so
long for one thing?

01:46:35.890 --> 01:46:38.109
One tiny moment.

01:46:38.183 --> 01:46:40.902
I had that moment today, too.

01:46:40.978 --> 01:46:43.151
You see this badge?

01:46:43.230 --> 01:46:47.076
This badge means that I was
made CBP Field Commissioner.

01:46:47.151 --> 01:46:52.157
It means that my authority over the
security of this airport is absolute.

01:46:53.574 --> 01:46:55.918
Your ticket and your passport.

01:46:58.704 --> 01:47:01.048
It's time for you to go home.

01:47:05.044 --> 01:47:08.719
Officer Waylin, please show
Mr. Navorski into the terminal

01:47:08.797 --> 01:47:11.721
and make sure he does
not miss his flight.

01:47:11.800 --> 01:47:14.144
Goodbye, Viktor, and good luck.

01:47:24.313 --> 01:47:26.691
I think I want go New York City.

01:47:28.859 --> 01:47:30.953
Don't make this difficult, Viktor.

01:47:31.028 --> 01:47:33.122
I no more "unacceptable."

01:47:34.031 --> 01:47:37.456
- I told you this is over.
- I go New York.

01:47:40.204 --> 01:47:42.627
Are you sure you want to do that?

01:47:43.958 --> 01:47:45.960
I go New York City now.

01:47:50.923 --> 01:47:56.305
Part of my job is to get rid of
undesirables, and there are quite a few.

01:47:57.554 --> 01:48:00.273
Like this guy, Joe Mulroy.
I think you know him.

01:48:00.349 --> 01:48:04.399
He's been here for 20 years, but he's
been running an after-hour poker game.

01:48:04.478 --> 01:48:06.697
Bringing in liquor and marijuana.

01:48:06.772 --> 01:48:10.822
Poor guy's going to lose his pension.
And I think he has kids, too.

01:48:10.901 --> 01:48:11.993
Yep.

01:48:12.069 --> 01:48:16.950
And then there's this guy, Enrique Cruz.
I think you also know Enrique.

01:48:17.032 --> 01:48:22.004
Enrique has been letting people
into the food preparation area.

01:48:22.079 --> 01:48:24.002
That's a major security breach.

01:48:24.081 --> 01:48:26.175
The poor guy,
I think he's a newlywed.

01:48:26.250 --> 01:48:28.344
But I'm going to
have to let him go.

01:48:28.419 --> 01:48:33.141
And then there's Gupta
Rajan. He's a janitor.

01:48:33.215 --> 01:48:37.846
But he's wanted for assaulting a
police officer back in India in 1979.

01:48:39.221 --> 01:48:41.349
I'll have to deport him.

01:48:41.432 --> 01:48:43.434
I will go home.

01:48:44.393 --> 01:48:48.148
- I'm sorry. What did you say?
- I will go home.

01:48:48.230 --> 01:48:50.232
Leave them alone. I will go.

01:48:50.941 --> 01:48:52.534
- Today.
- Yes.

01:48:52.609 --> 01:48:55.863
If you don't get on that
plane, they're all gone.

01:48:55.946 --> 01:48:57.744
- Do you understand?
- Yes.

01:48:57.823 --> 01:48:59.325
Okay. Good.

01:49:13.338 --> 01:49:14.590
I don't believe you.

01:49:14.673 --> 01:49:18.394
- Viktor, you don't have to do this.
- You can fight these guys.

01:49:18.469 --> 01:49:21.313
- We'll help you.
- Viktor, come on. I owe you so much.

01:49:21.388 --> 01:49:24.062
- Please let me help you.
- This is your friend talking.

01:49:24.141 --> 01:49:26.644
We're all your friends.
We're your family now.

01:49:32.149 --> 01:49:33.241
Gupta.

01:49:33.317 --> 01:49:34.739
Goodbye.

01:49:34.818 --> 01:49:36.912
You try to fool us.

01:49:37.946 --> 01:49:42.497
You make us to think you would walk
out, that you will fight with them.

01:49:42.576 --> 01:49:44.328
Why don't you fight?

01:49:44.870 --> 01:49:49.125
- The war is over.
- Then go. Get lost.

01:49:49.208 --> 01:49:53.759
Get lost. Go home and tell
them you never made it.

01:49:54.088 --> 01:49:57.888
You come this close to America,

01:49:57.966 --> 01:50:02.187
but you don't have the courage
to go from here to here.

01:50:03.639 --> 01:50:05.437
You are a coward.

01:50:05.516 --> 01:50:08.360
The plane is on time.

01:50:08.435 --> 01:50:10.688
You are a coward.

01:50:11.396 --> 01:50:13.865
You are a coward!

01:50:13.941 --> 01:50:15.614
You make me sick!

01:50:15.692 --> 01:50:19.117
What's wrong with you,
man? Settle down.

01:50:19.196 --> 01:50:22.700
Got people looking all around,
looking at me like I'm...

01:50:25.369 --> 01:50:26.837
Look at me.

01:50:27.579 --> 01:50:29.547
Come on, look at me.

01:50:34.294 --> 01:50:36.513
There's something you should know.

01:50:41.051 --> 01:50:43.520
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
United Airlines Flight 865</i>

01:50:43.595 --> 01:50:47.225
<i>from Krakozhia has landed and
is now taxiing to the gate.</i>

01:50:47.307 --> 01:50:50.982
<i>For those passengers holding tickets
for Flight 866 to Krakozhia,</i>

01:50:51.061 --> 01:50:53.405
<i>we expect departure
to be on schedule.</i>

01:51:21.175 --> 01:51:22.392
Gupta.

01:51:34.980 --> 01:51:36.527
Gupta.

01:52:08.680 --> 01:52:11.433
I am going home.

01:52:15.229 --> 01:52:17.277
Get lost.

01:52:28.575 --> 01:52:30.293
<i>Your attention, please.</i>

01:52:30.369 --> 01:52:35.466
<i>Flight 866 to Krakozhia will be
delayed until further notice.</i>

01:52:43.840 --> 01:52:46.514
Do you have an appointment?

01:52:48.845 --> 01:52:51.689
Somebody tell me what the
hell is going on down there.

01:52:54.685 --> 01:52:56.687
We're right behind you.

01:53:01.066 --> 01:53:02.363
Viktor's leaving.

01:53:17.374 --> 01:53:21.095
- Monica, Viktor's leaving.
- I know. He's going home.

01:53:21.169 --> 01:53:23.422
He's going for the front
door, out to the city.

01:53:23.505 --> 01:53:25.178
What? Oh, my...

01:53:34.558 --> 01:53:36.560
Viktor. Remember us.

01:53:36.643 --> 01:53:39.362
From the Discovery Store,
I want to give you this.

01:53:39.438 --> 01:53:40.564
It's good luck.

01:53:40.647 --> 01:53:42.615
A digital camera for Cousin Katia.

01:53:42.691 --> 01:53:46.537
I don't know where you're going,
but these will keep your feet warm.

01:53:56.121 --> 01:53:58.249
- Everybody in position?
- We're here.

01:53:58.332 --> 01:53:59.675
Secure the door.

01:54:11.845 --> 01:54:13.847
Sorry, Viktor.

01:54:17.351 --> 01:54:18.443
Take him, Judge.

01:54:19.811 --> 01:54:22.280
Hold it, Viktor. Take it easy.

01:54:24.775 --> 01:54:26.994
You see those doors?

01:54:27.069 --> 01:54:29.618
Those are the entry
doors to New York City.

01:54:29.696 --> 01:54:32.040
To the United States of
America. Turn around.

01:54:42.918 --> 01:54:46.468
It's snowing in the city, and
you're going to need that.

01:54:50.467 --> 01:54:51.468
Good luck.

01:54:52.302 --> 01:54:53.554
Oh, no.

01:54:57.182 --> 01:54:58.559
I'm going to miss you.

01:54:58.642 --> 01:55:00.895
Try not to get stuck
wherever you're going.

01:55:00.977 --> 01:55:03.071
Arrest him! Arrest him!

01:55:03.146 --> 01:55:05.820
God damn it!

01:55:50.694 --> 01:55:52.446
Taxi.

01:56:05.292 --> 01:56:06.464
Thank you.

01:56:46.333 --> 01:56:48.836
Where you go?

01:56:48.919 --> 01:56:53.971
161 Lexington. Please take Van Wyck
Expressway to Queensboro Bridge.

01:56:54.049 --> 01:56:55.676
It's faster than BQE.

01:56:55.759 --> 01:56:59.229
- Where you from?
- Krakozhia. Viktor Navorski.

01:56:59.304 --> 01:57:01.557
I'm Goran. Albania.

01:57:01.640 --> 01:57:05.895
- When do you come to New York?
- Thursday.

01:57:15.070 --> 01:57:19.997
You want us to block the south exit
and have AP sweep every vehicle?

01:57:21.409 --> 01:57:23.002
Sir?

01:57:27.082 --> 01:57:29.676
5:30 from Tokyo just landed.

01:57:29.751 --> 01:57:33.847
Got two planes on the tarmac.
Barcelona on approach.

01:57:33.922 --> 01:57:37.517
The night is young, and 1,500
people are headed our way.

01:57:39.761 --> 01:57:42.890
Everybody inside. Everybody inside.

01:57:42.973 --> 01:57:44.566
- Come on.
- Let's go.

01:57:44.641 --> 01:57:45.984
Let's go.

01:58:15.672 --> 01:58:20.394
- Are you checking in, sir?
- No, no. I don't check in.

01:58:20.468 --> 01:58:22.311
I want to go to this place, please.

01:58:22.387 --> 01:58:24.515
The lobby lounge is
around the corner.

01:58:24.598 --> 01:58:28.523
They have happy hour specials
and live music. Do you like jazz?

01:58:43.867 --> 01:58:47.792
Let's do <i>Killer Joe.</i>
It worked all right last night.

01:58:47.871 --> 01:58:50.795
- Yes?
- You are Benny Golson?

01:58:50.874 --> 01:58:53.172
Yeah. Yes, I am.

01:58:54.544 --> 01:58:58.799
Benny Golson, I am Viktor
Navorski. I am from Krakozhia.

01:58:58.882 --> 01:59:04.514
My father, Dimitar Asenov Navorski,
was great, great fan of your music.

01:59:04.596 --> 01:59:06.473
Oh, a jazz fan. Fantastic.

01:59:08.099 --> 01:59:11.524
Would you sign your name, please?

01:59:11.603 --> 01:59:15.653
Oh. Can I do it a little later?
We have to get started now.

01:59:15.732 --> 01:59:17.154
- Just a minute.
- I will wait.

01:59:17.233 --> 01:59:18.735
Okay.

02:00:24.134 --> 02:00:26.011
Taxi. Taxi.

02:00:47.991 --> 02:00:50.119
Where you want to go?

02:00:53.621 --> 02:00:56.124
I am going home.
