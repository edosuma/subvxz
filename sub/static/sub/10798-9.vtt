You're talking about slavery.

l don't think that's a little harsh,
l think that's the truth.

43:54.423 --> 43:56.299
l have no right to be there.

43:56.508 --> 43:58.509
Because you failed in your task?

43:58.719 --> 44:01.888
No, God, no.
l came that close to winning, Data.

44:02.097 --> 44:03.181
DATA:
Yes, sir.

44:03.390 --> 44:05.516
l almost cost you your life.

44:06.143 --> 44:10.271
ls it not true
that had you refused to prosecute,

44:10.481 --> 44:13.358
Captain Louvois would have ruled
summarily against me?

44:13.901 --> 44:15.151
Yes.

44:15.361 --> 44:17.862
That action injured you

44:18.072 --> 44:20.198
and saved me.

44:20.866 --> 44:22.992
l will not forget it.

44:25.663 --> 44:27.997
You're a wise man, my friend.

44:28.165 --> 44:29.791
Not yet, sir.

44:30.000 --> 44:33.378
But with your help, l am learning.
