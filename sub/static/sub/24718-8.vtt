- <i>Previously on</i> Good Witch...
- Who are you talking to?

00:02.907 --> 00:07.345
Noah. He's visiting his mom
in New York. I missed you.

00:07.386 --> 00:09.353
- I missed you too.
- Noah!

00:09.388 --> 00:11.310
I always hear about places
with small town charm,

00:11.346 --> 00:13.991
but this place actually has it,
and... I've decided

00:14.026 --> 00:15.859
that this would be the perfect place

00:15.895 --> 00:17.861
to put my company's headquarters.

00:17.897 --> 00:19.696
So that means you'd
be living in Middleton?

00:19.732 --> 00:21.899
- Yeah!
- <i>I'm gonna love you</i>

00:21.934 --> 00:24.368
as if each day was the only one
we had. I wrote down

00:24.403 --> 00:26.303
when I wanted our wedding day to be.

00:26.338 --> 00:28.372
That's less than three weeks away.

00:28.407 --> 00:30.307
We better get to work.

00:41.587 --> 00:44.087
- Good morning.
- Hello.

00:44.123 --> 00:46.657
- What's all this?
- Different things Sam and I

00:46.692 --> 00:48.559
need to decide on before the wedding.

00:48.594 --> 00:50.828
Stephanie dropped some cakes
by for us to try,

00:50.863 --> 00:53.063
and I am listening to a band
that Sam wants to hire

00:53.098 --> 00:55.732
- for the reception.
- I can't believe you're putting

00:55.768 --> 00:58.055
together an entire wedding
in less than three weeks.

00:58.090 --> 01:01.405
- Well, when you're ready to get
married, the answer is: why wait?

01:01.440 --> 01:04.074
I suppose you're gonna ask me
to do the flowers?

01:04.108 --> 01:06.543
Actually, we were gonna hire someone else

01:06.579 --> 01:08.412
- and let you have the day off.
- Oh.

01:08.447 --> 01:10.714
Just kidding. Of course
we want you to do them.

01:10.749 --> 01:13.417
Well, because you want people
to be impressed.

01:13.452 --> 01:16.253
- Right?
- Right. Good morning, Phil.

01:16.288 --> 01:18.222
- Morning.
- Hey.

01:18.257 --> 01:20.924
I heard you and Abigail
come in last night.

01:20.960 --> 01:22.893
Well, I told him
he didn't have to walk me

01:22.928 --> 01:25.195
- all the way home, but...
- Well, you were already home.

01:25.231 --> 01:28.465
All I did was walk you to your room, which is right
above mine, so it wasn't that far of a walk.

01:28.501 --> 01:30.434
Well, it's still sweet of you
to make sure she got there.

01:30.469 --> 01:32.903
- Do you want some breakfast?
- Oh, no.

01:32.938 --> 01:34.905
Thank you. I have to get to City Hall.

01:34.940 --> 01:36.697
- Oh.
- He's rezoning the old mill

01:36.732 --> 01:38.829
because he wants to move his
company's headquarters here.

01:38.864 --> 01:40.627
Well, I hope things turn out
the way you want them to.

01:40.662 --> 01:43.039
Thank you. May I drop you
at the shop on my way?

01:43.074 --> 01:44.588
Absolutely.

01:45.818 --> 01:47.918
- Hey, Phil.
- Morning.

01:47.953 --> 01:50.954
Oh, Abigail. I'm glad
I caught you. I was wondering...

01:50.990 --> 01:53.123
Sorry, Sam. That's my ride.

01:58.030 --> 02:00.597
I was hoping to talk with her
about doing the flowers

02:00.633 --> 02:01.632
- for the wedding.
- I already did,

02:01.667 --> 02:03.467
- and she is.
- Hmm.

02:03.502 --> 02:05.569
Great. Oh, how'd you like the band?

02:05.604 --> 02:07.804
Oh, sign them up. And...

02:07.840 --> 02:09.639
Stephanie brought by these cakes.

02:09.675 --> 02:11.475
- This one is my favourite.
- Hmm.

02:11.510 --> 02:13.644
Oh, that is good.

02:15.681 --> 02:18.148
So this wedding is
actually coming together.

02:18.183 --> 02:20.017
Piece of cake.

02:20.017 --> 02:21.983
You know, I think we should
get our invitations out

02:22.019 --> 02:24.586
- before the end of the week.
- Yeah. I will try to finish

02:24.621 --> 02:26.855
- my list of people to invite.
- OK. I'll do mine too.

02:26.890 --> 02:30.708
Then, all I have to do is
find the right dress to wear.

02:30.743 --> 02:32.694
You could wear jeans
and a t-shirt and still be

02:32.729 --> 02:35.617
- the most beautiful bride ever.
- I'm not wearing jeans and a t-shirt.

02:35.652 --> 02:37.232
Can I wear jeans and a t-shirt?

02:37.267 --> 02:38.518
No.

02:38.554 --> 02:41.569
I'm glad I asked you then,
before I showed up on the day.

02:45.776 --> 02:48.410
Fordham University in New York?

02:48.445 --> 02:50.412
Yeah. They're offering me a full ride.

02:50.447 --> 02:52.580
The coach even wants
Noah to start practicing

02:52.616 --> 02:54.215
before he's officially enrolled.

02:54.251 --> 02:57.886
- When are you gonna move there?
- As soon as we graduate.

02:57.921 --> 03:00.288
This is really great, Noah.

03:00.324 --> 03:02.257
Congratulations.

03:02.292 --> 03:04.759
What's great?
And congratulations about what?

03:04.795 --> 03:07.562
Noah got accepted at Fordham,
to play baseball there.

03:07.597 --> 03:09.898
Oh! Well, that is great.

03:09.933 --> 03:11.800
You know, when you're starting

03:11.835 --> 03:14.369
for the White Sox someday,
I'm gonna want tickets

03:14.404 --> 03:17.000
- along the third baseline.
- White Sox?

03:17.036 --> 03:19.874
- No. My son's gonna be a Yankee.
- Well, then...

03:19.910 --> 03:21.976
he's gonna lose to Chicago.

03:22.012 --> 03:23.778
We'll see.

03:23.814 --> 03:26.281
What is your very favourite
thing that I make?

03:26.316 --> 03:28.416
I like the butterscotch milkshake.

03:28.452 --> 03:31.052
Well, then I'll bring one
of those on the house.

03:31.088 --> 03:32.988
Thanks, Stephanie.

03:35.424 --> 03:37.892
Have you told Grace you're gonna
be going to school in New York?

03:37.928 --> 03:39.961
Not yet.

03:39.996 --> 03:42.297
Where are the colleges
she's thinking about?

03:42.332 --> 03:44.232
Nowhere near New York.

03:44.820 --> 03:46.620
When are you gonna tell her the news?

03:47.085 --> 03:49.304
Soon as I figure out what to say.

03:59.072 --> 04:00.415
- Hey, Mom.
- Hi, honey.

04:00.450 --> 04:03.084
Grandpa, what are you doing?

04:03.120 --> 04:05.286
I'm trying to get this drawer open.

04:05.322 --> 04:07.021
It's just stuck.

04:07.564 --> 04:09.157
You should try to open it, Grace.

04:09.192 --> 04:11.326
I've already given it quite a pull.

04:11.361 --> 04:13.461
Well, maybe it needs a special touch.

04:14.279 --> 04:16.531
I can give it a try.

04:19.302 --> 04:21.302
- Oh!
- Oh! Whoa!

04:21.338 --> 04:23.338
I must have loosened it for you.

04:23.373 --> 04:26.274
That's probably it.

04:28.478 --> 04:30.462
There's something inside.

04:33.150 --> 04:34.682
It's an envelope.

04:35.092 --> 04:36.684
How long do you think
it's been back there?

04:36.720 --> 04:38.853
Well, that's hard to tell.
That desk has been here

04:38.889 --> 04:40.855
- since I moved in.
- It might have been there

04:40.891 --> 04:43.225
since Grey House was built.

04:45.395 --> 04:47.862
"My dearest father and mother..."

04:50.367 --> 04:52.333
It's signed "Elizabeth."

04:52.818 --> 04:54.335
Merriwick?

04:54.371 --> 04:56.371
It looks like it.

04:57.030 --> 04:59.974
"By the time you read
this letter, I will have fled

05:00.010 --> 05:03.178
to pursue a lifetime
with my one and only love."

05:03.213 --> 05:05.547
Oh, she must have written that
before she ran off

05:05.582 --> 05:07.816
to marry Andrew Wymark.

05:07.851 --> 05:10.385
Her father didn't approve,
so they had to elope.

05:10.420 --> 05:12.554
It says here that they planned

05:12.589 --> 05:15.044
a wedding at Grey House.

05:15.079 --> 05:18.059
Oh, I didn't know they were
gonna have the ceremony here.

05:18.094 --> 05:21.599
And she already had her dress
made. Look, it describes it right there.

05:21.635 --> 05:22.931
"I mostly regret

05:22.966 --> 05:25.400
"that I shall never wear
the gown that was crafted

05:25.435 --> 05:27.101
"so carefully for me.

05:27.137 --> 05:29.404
"I only hope the Netherton family

05:29.439 --> 05:32.907
"is as joyed to see their daughter Fiona

05:32.943 --> 05:34.742
"walk the aisle as I longed

05:34.778 --> 05:36.711
for you to see me."

05:36.746 --> 05:39.247
So she gave her wedding dress away?

05:39.282 --> 05:42.016
To Fiona Netherton.

05:42.951 --> 05:44.686
What do you think happened to it?

05:45.162 --> 05:48.089
I guess we'll have
to ask Fiona Netherton.

05:48.124 --> 05:50.925
George, that would have been
almost 100 years ago.

05:50.961 --> 05:54.262
But... she had to have done
something with her dress

05:54.297 --> 05:57.220
- after she got married.
- That's true.

05:57.256 --> 05:59.868
I wonder if anyone
ever wore it after that.

06:21.625 --> 06:23.791
<i>What are you hoping to find in here?</i>

06:23.827 --> 06:26.294
I wanna find out
who married Fiona Netherton

06:26.329 --> 06:28.229
so I can track down their descendants.

06:28.265 --> 06:31.266
That information should
be in the census records,

06:31.301 --> 06:33.801
and they're in the last filing
cabinet there, on the right.

06:33.837 --> 06:35.803
- OK.
- But that's if you know the

06:35.839 --> 06:37.939
- year she was married exactly.
- I don't.

06:37.974 --> 06:40.808
Well then, that's gonna
make this a bit of a hunt.

06:43.806 --> 06:45.472
So...

06:46.306 --> 06:48.483
How goes the wedding planning?

06:48.518 --> 06:50.151
Oh, really well so far.

06:50.186 --> 06:52.854
You know, they do say that
the days leading up to a wedding

06:52.889 --> 06:56.231
can be one of the most stressful
times in any relationship.

06:56.266 --> 06:58.493
Well, it hasn't been for me and Sam.

06:58.528 --> 07:01.095
Oh. No conflict at all?

07:01.131 --> 07:03.865
Well, we both seem
to want the same things.

07:04.467 --> 07:07.502
Tom and I could hardly agree
on anything about our wedding,

07:07.537 --> 07:09.504
including who we wanted to be there.

07:09.539 --> 07:11.839
Oh. Well, we haven't decided
on exactly who we want there,

07:11.875 --> 07:14.326
but I'm pretty sure Sam and I
can get on the same page.

07:14.361 --> 07:17.779
- Hmm.
- What is all this stuff?

07:17.814 --> 07:20.448
Oh, in there? That's mostly
newspaper clippings.

07:20.483 --> 07:22.450
Anything pertaining
to population, increases

07:22.485 --> 07:26.020
and adjustments, you know. Birth
announcements, funeral notices.

07:26.056 --> 07:29.247
- And wedding photos.
- But you know, if we don't know

07:29.282 --> 07:31.192
the exact year, then I still
don't know how you're gonna

07:31.227 --> 07:33.194
- find what you're looking for.
- Well, I know

07:33.229 --> 07:36.364
- about when the wedding happened.
- Aboutwhen?

07:36.399 --> 07:38.900
Cassie, that means we could be
searching through who knows

07:38.935 --> 07:41.202
how many clippings before we find...

07:41.237 --> 07:42.571
I found it.

07:43.373 --> 07:46.857
What?! Oh!

07:46.893 --> 07:50.545
- Look at that dress.
- It really is beautiful.

07:50.580 --> 07:53.946
"Fiona Netherton married Jonathan Powell

07:53.981 --> 07:56.851
last week in a ceremony
at the Botanical Gardens."

07:56.886 --> 07:59.114
So Fiona Netherton became Fiona Powell.

07:59.149 --> 08:01.054
Well, that's something to go on at least.

08:01.089 --> 08:03.191
Yeah, it's a start.

08:03.226 --> 08:05.193
You know, that dress
would look gorgeous on you.

08:05.228 --> 08:07.395
It would be perfect, wouldn't it?

08:08.221 --> 08:10.698
If I can only figure out where it is...

08:13.143 --> 08:15.127
- Abigail.
- Hello.

08:15.162 --> 08:17.105
Hi. Where are you heading?

08:17.140 --> 08:18.906
I'm just on my way to Grey House.

08:18.942 --> 08:21.129
Oh, that works out.
I'm going that way too.

08:21.164 --> 08:23.411
How did it go at City Hall?

08:23.446 --> 08:25.713
Oh... not so good.

08:25.749 --> 08:28.082
I filled out form after form.

08:28.118 --> 08:30.218
Then, they told me there's
a backlog, so I won't hear

08:30.253 --> 08:32.886
about my rezoning request until
my application gets to the top

08:32.922 --> 08:35.357
- of some huge pile.
- How long is that gonna take?

08:35.392 --> 08:36.591
They said it could be months!

08:37.207 --> 08:39.499
I was really hoping to get
things moving before then.

08:40.155 --> 08:42.563
You know, sometimes in
Middleton, things move

08:42.599 --> 08:44.932
a lot faster than you'd think.

08:44.968 --> 08:46.934
So I'm just supposed
to wait around for something

08:46.970 --> 08:50.071
- magical to happen?
- That's one way of putting it.

08:51.641 --> 08:53.608
You know, I don't always know
exactly what you're saying,

08:53.643 --> 08:56.110
but I sure love watching you say it.

08:56.146 --> 08:58.780
Well, keep watching just in case things

08:58.815 --> 09:00.732
get even more interesting.

09:04.320 --> 09:07.094
Are you inviting any
of the old gang from New York?

09:07.129 --> 09:09.624
Yeah, I might. It'd be nice
to see Gavin and Pat again.

09:09.659 --> 09:11.626
Do they know that you're
gonna be taking the plunge?

09:11.661 --> 09:13.995
I don't know. I'll send 'em an
invite, see if they can make it.

09:14.030 --> 09:16.675
- Did you guys enjoy lunch?
- I did...

09:16.710 --> 09:19.801
- 'cause he paid.
- Oh. Thanks.

09:19.836 --> 09:21.636
Hey, did you tell Cassie
the news about Noah?

09:21.671 --> 09:23.471
Oh. Noah got accepted into Fordham.

09:23.506 --> 09:25.440
- Oh, that's great!
- Yeah. They want him there

09:25.475 --> 09:27.681
to start practicing as soon
as he can get there.

09:27.716 --> 09:30.445
Which is sooner than you
thought he'd be leaving.

09:30.480 --> 09:31.979
Yeah... I thought I'd have

09:32.015 --> 09:33.648
at least until the end of summer,

09:33.683 --> 09:36.150
but he's going to be moving as
soon as he graduates now.

09:36.186 --> 09:39.654
- And he hasn't told Grace yet.
- How do you know that for sure?

09:39.689 --> 09:41.656
She would have told me right away.

09:41.691 --> 09:43.658
It's gonna be hard on both of them.

09:43.693 --> 09:45.235
Yeah, it is.

09:46.196 --> 09:47.995
Well, I better get back to work.

09:48.031 --> 09:49.797
- OK.
- What's that?

09:49.833 --> 09:52.333
Oh, it's a new piece by James Cavell.

09:52.368 --> 09:55.002
- Oh. I like it.
- Since when are you

09:55.038 --> 09:57.004
- into sculptures?
- Since I saw this

09:57.040 --> 09:59.006
and said I like it.

09:59.042 --> 10:01.342
There's an exhibit going on
at the Daverson Gallery

10:01.377 --> 10:04.859
- at the old train station.
- Maybe I'll check it out.

10:05.562 --> 10:08.783
- Yeah. I gotta go too. Bye.
- OK. Bye.

10:08.818 --> 10:10.685
See you.

10:27.070 --> 10:29.036
Noah! What are you doing here?

10:29.571 --> 10:32.473
There's something we need to talk about.

10:34.242 --> 10:35.869
OK.

10:45.003 --> 10:46.854
- Agnes!
- Cassie, yes.

10:46.890 --> 10:48.856
- Come in.
- Thank you.

10:48.892 --> 10:51.392
Thank you so much
for letting me come over.

10:51.427 --> 10:54.729
Well, I've been in your shop
a few times and you were always

10:54.764 --> 10:56.731
so helpful to me in there.

10:56.766 --> 10:59.367
Walter, this is Cassie Nightingale.

10:59.402 --> 11:01.736
Yes, Agnes told me
you were gonna drop by.

11:01.771 --> 11:04.205
- Yes, thank you.
- You wanted to know something

11:04.240 --> 11:07.708
- about my mother's wedding dress?
- I was wondering if you knew

11:07.744 --> 11:09.744
- what happened to it.
- Well, you can see

11:09.779 --> 11:12.013
- for yourself.
- I can?

11:12.048 --> 11:13.615
Mm-hmm.

11:17.620 --> 11:20.021
That's me, 62 years ago.

11:20.056 --> 11:22.757
Oh, wow. You looked beautiful.

11:22.792 --> 11:25.092
And you can see how happy I was.

11:25.128 --> 11:27.762
Wow, that dress seems so delicate.

11:27.797 --> 11:29.597
Mm-hmm, I thought so too,

11:29.632 --> 11:32.466
but they made things
to last in those days.

11:32.502 --> 11:36.204
I danced up a storm
and didn't break a stitch.

11:36.239 --> 11:38.606
- Oh.
- The initials "E.M."

11:38.641 --> 11:42.434
were sewn into the back of the collar.

11:42.469 --> 11:44.779
My mother told me that was her friend.

11:44.814 --> 11:47.882
Elizabeth Merriwick.
She was a relative of mine.

11:47.917 --> 11:50.918
There's also a pocket inside

11:50.954 --> 11:52.787
where I put the love letter
Walter wrote me

11:52.822 --> 11:54.789
the night before we wed.

11:54.824 --> 11:57.124
We both did that so we could

11:57.160 --> 11:58.793
take them out and read them to each other

11:58.828 --> 12:01.729
- on our first anniversary.
- What a beautiful thing to do.

12:01.764 --> 12:03.798
Do you still have the dress?

12:03.833 --> 12:05.800
No. Our daughter-in-law

12:05.835 --> 12:07.802
bought a dress of her own,

12:07.837 --> 12:09.770
so I passed that on to our granddaughter

12:09.806 --> 12:13.274
when she got married. I figured
something that nice

12:13.309 --> 12:15.810
shouldn't be packed away in a box.

12:15.845 --> 12:17.812
Do you think she still has it?

12:17.847 --> 12:19.513
I don't know.

12:19.549 --> 12:21.482
Well, I would love to get
in touch with her and find out.

12:22.142 --> 12:24.626
I'll write down
exactly where you can find her.

12:24.661 --> 12:26.787
- Thanks.
- Yeah, I remember

12:26.823 --> 12:28.656
on that day thinking...

12:28.691 --> 12:31.922
I could never love that woman
any more than I did right then.

12:32.557 --> 12:33.661
But then the next day,

12:33.696 --> 12:35.796
I loved her even more.

12:35.832 --> 12:37.932
And the next day after that.

12:37.967 --> 12:41.002
62 years' worth of days and...

12:41.037 --> 12:44.639
each one stronger than the day before.

12:49.846 --> 12:51.421
Thanks.

12:57.532 --> 13:00.100
When would you have to leave?

13:00.135 --> 13:02.421
The day after we graduate.

13:02.456 --> 13:06.186
So they must really want you... bad.

13:06.187 --> 13:08.321
They do, yeah.

13:08.356 --> 13:10.323
So you're going.

13:10.358 --> 13:12.400
Yes, but...

13:13.394 --> 13:15.294
you're still gonna be in Middleton.

13:15.330 --> 13:18.364
I haven't decided
where I'm going to be yet

13:18.399 --> 13:19.811
and... they've got

13:19.847 --> 13:21.823
this thing called technology now.

13:21.858 --> 13:25.872
You mean you don't have to be
in the same room as somebody

13:25.907 --> 13:28.374
to have a conversation with them
and see their face?

13:28.409 --> 13:30.376
It's amazing.

13:31.127 --> 13:33.079
We'll make it work.

13:34.636 --> 13:36.549
And I really am happy for you.

13:40.359 --> 13:42.371
Have you seen any of his work?

13:42.407 --> 13:44.828
Uh, I'm not really an art expert.

13:44.863 --> 13:47.143
Ah, well you are gonna love it.

13:47.866 --> 13:50.834
- Stephanie.
- Liam! This is Paul.

13:50.869 --> 13:52.669
- Hi.
- Hi.

13:52.705 --> 13:54.838
I didn't know you were
a James Cavell fan.

13:54.873 --> 13:56.840
Well, I just recently became one,

13:56.875 --> 13:59.843
- but I really like his stuff.
- Ah, I can't wait to see it!

13:59.878 --> 14:01.612
Well, have fun. Nice to meet you.

14:01.647 --> 14:04.615
- Yeah, you too.
- Bye!

14:12.891 --> 14:15.025
- Madam Mayor?
- Oh, Abigail! Come in.

14:15.060 --> 14:17.628
Jared said you were working, but...

14:17.663 --> 14:19.696
Well, you know what? I could use a break.

14:19.732 --> 14:21.932
I've been signing so many
documents, I feel like

14:21.967 --> 14:24.619
my arm is going to fall off.
Everything from zoning permits

14:24.654 --> 14:26.303
to variance requests

14:26.338 --> 14:29.425
to... you know what,
I don't even know what this is.

14:29.460 --> 14:31.708
It looks like it could take
a long time to get through

14:31.744 --> 14:33.710
- every single one of those.
- Well, yes.

14:33.746 --> 14:37.073
The wheels of justice turn
slowly; ditto city government.

14:37.109 --> 14:39.883
- What is it you wanted?
- Oh, it's nothing important.

14:39.918 --> 14:41.885
Have you been stuck in here all day?

14:41.920 --> 14:44.888
Uh-huh, and probably will be
for part of the night as well.

14:44.923 --> 14:46.890
You should open the windows,

14:46.925 --> 14:48.558
let some fresh air in here.

14:48.594 --> 14:51.595
You know, that's a very good idea.

14:51.630 --> 14:53.897
I sometimes forget
that these things actually open

14:53.932 --> 14:55.628
to the outside world.

14:56.494 --> 14:59.963
OH! Oh! Oh, no! Oh! Ah! Oh!

15:02.775 --> 15:05.075
That'll teach me to try to think beyond

15:05.110 --> 15:07.110
the confines of this office.

15:07.640 --> 15:09.346
I can put these in order for you.

15:09.381 --> 15:11.548
I don't even know what order
they were in. You know what?

15:11.583 --> 15:13.917
Whatever. I'll just make a new pile

15:13.952 --> 15:15.919
and work my way down.

15:15.954 --> 15:17.688
Wait a minute.

15:18.484 --> 15:20.691
Who's trying to rezone the old mill?

15:21.738 --> 15:23.927
Well, if somebody wants to do something

15:23.962 --> 15:25.929
with that dilapidated old thing,

15:25.964 --> 15:28.598
the sooner the better.

15:28.634 --> 15:30.400
Do you want me to take that out to Jared

15:30.436 --> 15:32.202
so he can send it on
to the right department?

15:32.237 --> 15:33.937
- Would you?
- Mm-hmm.

15:33.972 --> 15:36.940
Thank you. One less thing
I have to think about.

15:36.975 --> 15:40.444
And things will move
a lot faster that way.

15:46.752 --> 15:48.318
Oh.

15:48.354 --> 15:51.027
Well, the invitations won't
go out for a few days,

15:51.062 --> 15:52.786
but you should still
probably save the date.

15:52.822 --> 15:54.591
If you want me
at your wedding, I'll be there.

15:54.626 --> 15:56.559
And there'll be a lot
of healthy food there, so you

15:56.595 --> 15:58.691
- can eat whatever you want.
- Sounds even better.

15:58.727 --> 16:00.360
Have a good day.

16:02.987 --> 16:04.835
- What?
- Nothing.

16:04.870 --> 16:07.571
No, that's your be-careful-
what-you're-getting-into look.

16:07.606 --> 16:09.406
You're going to be setting a precedent

16:09.441 --> 16:11.174
if you start inviting your patients.

16:11.210 --> 16:13.744
Tim is not just a patient.
He's my accountant.

16:13.779 --> 16:15.846
I'm just saying
if you invite one patient,

16:15.881 --> 16:17.981
people are going to expect you
to invite them all.

16:18.016 --> 16:20.984
I think I can manage to keep
the numbers reasonable.

16:21.019 --> 16:22.310
- Cassie.
- Hi.

16:22.345 --> 16:24.988
We were just talking about the
guest list for your wedding.

16:25.023 --> 16:26.990
- How is yours coming?
- You know, I've added a few

16:27.025 --> 16:29.626
names to the list, and I am getting close

16:29.661 --> 16:31.628
to finding Elizabeth Merriwick's dress.

16:31.663 --> 16:33.764
Ah. Did you talk to that woman
you thought might have it?

16:33.799 --> 16:35.832
I did. She gave it
to her granddaughter who works

16:35.868 --> 16:38.668
at a music store and I'm going
there this afternoon.

16:38.704 --> 16:41.389
- Think you might find it there?
- Well, I'm gonna keep looking

16:41.425 --> 16:43.473
- until I do.
- I didn't know you'd have to go

16:43.509 --> 16:45.709
to so much trouble just to find
the perfect dress.

16:45.744 --> 16:48.199
It's gonna be worth it. You'll see.

16:50.673 --> 16:53.016
It's gonna be weird not having
you around anymore.

16:53.051 --> 16:55.652
Yeah. It seems like just
yesterday I moved to Middleton

16:55.687 --> 16:58.855
- and we didn't get along at all.
- The good old days.

16:58.891 --> 17:00.957
- Yeah.
- Here you are.

17:00.993 --> 17:02.659
- Hi.
- OK.

17:02.694 --> 17:04.661
So, I printed out some dates
over the summer that we

17:04.695 --> 17:06.444
might want to think about
visiting each other.

17:06.480 --> 17:09.031
The blue is you coming here and
the red is me going to New York.

17:09.067 --> 17:11.271
Actually, it's maroon, which is

17:11.307 --> 17:13.201
Fordham's school colour.

17:13.236 --> 17:17.040
This is great. Thanks. Oh, we
have to circle one more weekend.

17:17.075 --> 17:19.041
There's an exhibition game in the spring

17:19.077 --> 17:20.796
and they want me to come down
and play for it.

17:20.830 --> 17:22.936
Oh, then I will be there
to watch. When is it?

17:22.972 --> 17:26.316
- The second Saturday of May.
- The second Saturday...

17:27.886 --> 17:31.551
- Oh.
- Is that not gonna work?

17:31.587 --> 17:34.691
No. No, it's perfect. I'll be there.

17:38.764 --> 17:41.731
I can't believe the paperwork
for the rezoning got signed

17:41.767 --> 17:44.835
so fast. How do you think that happened?

17:44.870 --> 17:47.838
I don't know. Sometimes things
just breeze right through.

17:50.242 --> 17:52.342
Do you think City Council
will approve my bid?

17:52.377 --> 17:55.575
Phil... you're the only person
that wants this place.

17:55.610 --> 17:58.081
They'll rubber stamp it
without even thinking about it.

17:58.728 --> 18:00.617
I hope so...

18:00.652 --> 18:03.086
'cause I could get used
to being here for a long time.

18:18.136 --> 18:22.038
Feeling good for the duet?
I'll see you next week.

18:23.226 --> 18:24.539
Can I help you?

18:25.144 --> 18:27.110
Uh, yes. Are you Rachel Monroe?

18:27.145 --> 18:29.713
- I am.
- I am Cassie Nightingale.

18:29.748 --> 18:31.648
I was at your grandparents'
house yesterday.

18:31.683 --> 18:33.791
Grandma said you might be stopping by.

18:33.827 --> 18:36.319
They showed me a picture
of your grandma in the dress

18:36.355 --> 18:38.188
- she wore at her wedding.
- Oh!

18:38.223 --> 18:40.624
Didn't she look beautiful in
that? I mean, that's the reason

18:40.659 --> 18:42.382
I wanted to wear it when I got married.

18:42.418 --> 18:44.961
Aw. Well, it was made
for a relative of mine,

18:44.997 --> 18:46.963
- Elizabeth Merriwick.
- Her initials

18:46.999 --> 18:49.846
- were sewn into the collar.
- That's right.

18:49.881 --> 18:53.770
And I was wondering...
do you still have it?

18:53.805 --> 18:55.605
I don't.

18:55.641 --> 18:57.641
I got so many compliments about it

18:57.676 --> 19:00.143
on our wedding day,
and my husband's cousin

19:00.178 --> 19:02.679
begged me if she could wear it,
and back then we didn't have

19:02.714 --> 19:04.614
a lot of money, so we decided that dress

19:04.650 --> 19:06.483
would be our gift to her.

19:07.046 --> 19:09.659
- That's very nice.
- You know, if you give me your

19:09.694 --> 19:11.655
info, I can have my husband's
cousin get in touch with you.

19:11.690 --> 19:14.925
- Yeah, that would be great.
- When are you getting married?

19:14.960 --> 19:17.160
In a couple of weeks.

19:17.807 --> 19:19.796
I remember our wedding day.

19:19.831 --> 19:21.498
We filled the church

19:21.533 --> 19:23.667
with everyone who had ever
been important in our lives.

19:23.702 --> 19:26.136
My husband even invited
his first grade teacher.

19:26.171 --> 19:28.838
Mine was Mrs. Clippen.

19:28.874 --> 19:30.840
You never forget.

19:30.876 --> 19:33.209
I will pass this along and tell
her what you're looking for.

19:33.245 --> 19:34.699
Thank you.

19:38.216 --> 19:40.383
You sound very angelic.

19:40.419 --> 19:41.831
Thanks.

19:59.316 --> 20:01.852
- How long will you be gone for?
- Just a few days. The zoning

20:01.877 --> 20:03.777
got approved so quickly, I need
to put a bunch of things

20:03.812 --> 20:06.446
in motion. Get the Portland
offices thinking about the move

20:06.482 --> 20:10.184
- sooner rather than later.
- Well, before you go...

20:11.652 --> 20:13.854
I got something for you.

20:15.515 --> 20:17.858
I was dropping flowers off
at Cassie's shop and I saw that

20:17.893 --> 20:19.318
and it made me think of you.

20:19.991 --> 20:22.890
"Hidden Treasures of the
Pacific Northwest."

20:22.915 --> 20:25.664
It's full of hidden architectural
gems in the area.

20:25.700 --> 20:29.203
Did you know the architect who
designed the Columbia River Bridge

20:29.238 --> 20:31.538
put an outline of a rose
in the concrete moorings?

20:31.574 --> 20:33.207
That was his wife's name.

20:33.242 --> 20:36.210
Artists have different ways
of signing their work.

20:37.094 --> 20:38.245
Thank you.

20:38.280 --> 20:40.347
You're welcome.

20:40.382 --> 20:42.816
I'll be back before you know it.

20:43.309 --> 20:45.018
I'll know it.

20:48.648 --> 20:50.390
Come back soon, OK?

20:51.067 --> 20:52.726
I will.

21:00.769 --> 21:04.238
Oh, I'm so looking forward
to hearing this author talk!

21:04.273 --> 21:05.808
What books of his have you read?

21:05.843 --> 21:08.075
Uh, all of them.

21:08.110 --> 21:10.544
I didn't know he was in town
though until I saw his poster

21:10.579 --> 21:11.738
- in Cassie's shop.
- Hmm.

21:11.773 --> 21:15.249
- Yeah. Liam! Hi.
- Stephanie!

21:15.284 --> 21:16.917
And it's Paul, right?

21:16.952 --> 21:19.219
- Yeah. Yeah, hi.
- Good to see you.

21:19.255 --> 21:21.922
So, which of you is
the Christopher Riley fan?

21:21.957 --> 21:24.204
- That would be her.
- Oh. Yeah.

21:24.239 --> 21:26.404
Ah. Well, I never thought I'd
get so into historical fiction,

21:26.439 --> 21:28.762
but his World War II trilogy
made me a believer.

21:28.797 --> 21:30.464
Well, have you seen him speak before?

21:30.499 --> 21:33.400
- Twice.
- Oh. Well, it's my first time.

21:33.435 --> 21:35.269
Oh, you're gonna love him.

21:35.304 --> 21:38.272
- OK, folks. Come on in!
- Oh. Well, I'll see you inside.

21:38.307 --> 21:40.157
- OK. Yeah.
- Yeah.

21:42.868 --> 21:44.778
How goes the hunt for that dress?

21:44.813 --> 21:46.913
I feel like I'm getting closer.

21:46.949 --> 21:50.651
The music teacher gave me the
name of her husband's cousin,

21:50.686 --> 21:53.253
but I found out that she gave
the dress to a friend.

21:53.289 --> 21:55.455
I didn't realize wedding
dresses got passed around

21:55.491 --> 21:56.907
- so much.
- This one did

21:56.943 --> 21:59.426
because it was special,
and all the women who wore it

21:59.461 --> 22:01.728
- wanted it to be shared.
- Hmm.

22:01.764 --> 22:05.265
- Who was the last one to have it?
- Uh, Karen Zarish was the name

22:05.301 --> 22:08.135
I was given, but her friend
lost track of her

22:08.170 --> 22:10.304
just after she got married,
so I'm gonna go

22:10.339 --> 22:12.773
to the last known address
where she lived tomorrow.

22:12.808 --> 22:14.574
Huh. You know what? I've got a light day.

22:15.025 --> 22:18.145
- Why don't we go together?
- Ooh, it's bad luck

22:18.180 --> 22:20.781
for the groom to see the wedding
dress before the wedding.

22:20.816 --> 22:22.816
I thought that was just
about seeing the bride in it.

22:22.851 --> 22:25.652
- You can never be too careful.
- I'll look the other way.

22:25.688 --> 22:27.406
- OK.
- Plus, it'll give us time

22:27.441 --> 22:30.324
- to go over the guest list.
- Oh, I should warn you,

22:30.359 --> 22:32.326
I've added a few names to mine.

22:32.361 --> 22:34.194
Yeah, mine too. Turns out

22:34.229 --> 22:36.797
people actually like me
and wanna see me pledge my life

22:36.832 --> 22:39.156
- to the woman I love.
- You shouldn't be so nice,

22:39.191 --> 22:40.867
'cause then you wouldn't
have this problem.

22:40.903 --> 22:44.004
Yeah, I should rethink
my whole personality.

22:55.884 --> 22:58.485
- Stephanie?
- Oh! Hi, Grace.

22:58.520 --> 23:00.354
Don't you just love this place?

23:00.389 --> 23:02.289
I was just at a book reading
and thought I'd pop in

23:02.324 --> 23:04.726
to see if they had
anything new on my way home.

23:04.761 --> 23:07.361
You looking for something special?

23:07.396 --> 23:09.730
No. I was just gonna see
if they could sell this dress

23:09.765 --> 23:11.515
that I bought for prom.

23:11.550 --> 23:14.334
- Why are you selling your prom dress?
- Because Noah and I

23:14.370 --> 23:17.371
were supposed to go together,
but he has a game that weekend

23:17.406 --> 23:20.374
in New York and I promised him
that I would go watch him play.

23:20.409 --> 23:22.376
You're already thinking that far ahead?

23:22.411 --> 23:25.245
Yeah. Things are moving
faster than I thought.

23:25.280 --> 23:27.414
- Hi. Can I help you?
- Do you sell

23:27.449 --> 23:29.589
- dresses on consignment?
- We sure do.

23:29.625 --> 23:32.085
OK, then I would like to consign this.

23:32.121 --> 23:34.388
- Is that the right word?
- It is.

23:35.666 --> 23:37.891
Oh, this is gorgeous.

23:37.926 --> 23:40.360
- Thanks.
- I'm sure it'll

23:40.396 --> 23:43.397
- sell in no time.
- It really is beautiful.

23:43.432 --> 23:45.599
I bet it looked good on you.

23:45.634 --> 23:47.934
Yeah. It did.

23:58.943 --> 24:01.415
- Here you go.
- Oh, thank you.

24:01.450 --> 24:04.050
Abigail! I'm glad you're here.

24:04.086 --> 24:05.919
Another bid just came in for the old mill

24:05.954 --> 24:07.921
that your boyfriend is
trying to purchase.

24:07.956 --> 24:10.090
We're already calling Phil
Abigail's boyfriend?

24:10.125 --> 24:13.193
Well, what am I supposed
to call him? Her... man pal?

24:13.228 --> 24:16.062
I didn't know anyone else was
even interested in the mill.

24:16.098 --> 24:18.432
Well, no one was until it got
rezoned so quickly.

24:18.467 --> 24:21.535
And by law, the city is required
to consider all bids.

24:21.570 --> 24:24.137
- Well, who's the other bidder?
- Oh, some out-of-town investors

24:24.173 --> 24:27.240
who want to repurpose it
for mixed use. You know, shops

24:27.276 --> 24:30.110
- and theatres and condominiums.
- But Phil already submitted

24:30.145 --> 24:31.973
a proposal to make it office space!

24:32.008 --> 24:34.448
Well, I don't care what people
do with it as long as the city

24:34.483 --> 24:38.051
gets paid, which is why I intend
to call Phil to see if he wants

24:38.086 --> 24:40.287
to resubmit a higher bid
before the City Council meets

24:40.322 --> 24:42.422
to consider all the offers.

24:43.692 --> 24:45.858
You don't have to call him about that.

24:46.128 --> 24:47.794
Are you sure?

24:47.830 --> 24:49.930
The other bidders seem very determined.

24:49.965 --> 24:52.466
It's just I don't... things
have been going so smoothly,

24:52.501 --> 24:55.135
I wouldn't want Phil to think
there was anything complicated

24:55.170 --> 24:57.237
- about buying the mill.
- Well, I don't know

24:57.272 --> 24:59.573
why anyone would want to buy
a haunted old mill anyway.

24:59.608 --> 25:01.975
Well, that's just some silly story.

25:02.010 --> 25:04.644
Then how do you explain
what happened to me?

25:05.206 --> 25:06.446
What happened?

25:06.482 --> 25:08.615
Well, one night back
in high school, I was there

25:08.650 --> 25:11.184
with some friends and... we saw them.

25:11.220 --> 25:13.587
The tulips growing in a heart shape

25:13.622 --> 25:15.589
just like the legend says.

25:15.624 --> 25:17.909
Tulips growing inside the mill?

25:17.944 --> 25:20.660
In the very spot where that
lady is said to have laid down

25:20.696 --> 25:23.163
every night waiting
for her husband to return.

25:23.198 --> 25:25.499
- Hmm.
- I don't care what anyone does

25:25.534 --> 25:27.834
with that place. I am never
stepping foot in there again.

25:27.870 --> 25:31.338
Fine. Then I guess I'll
just have one less customer.

25:35.010 --> 25:37.544
Your sandwich is up, Noah.

25:37.579 --> 25:40.514
Here you go, with extra avocado

25:40.549 --> 25:42.716
to help power your swing.

25:42.751 --> 25:45.785
- Avocados do that?
- They are full of healthy fats

25:45.821 --> 25:47.521
to bulk you up. Now, I'm gonna get

25:47.556 --> 25:49.556
a little credit
for every home run you hit.

25:49.591 --> 25:52.158
I'll make sure
they mark that in the stats.

25:52.194 --> 25:55.028
We're gonna miss seeing you around here.

25:55.063 --> 25:57.197
Oh, I'm not going anywhere for a while.

25:57.232 --> 25:59.533
I know, but it still seems
a little too soon.

25:59.568 --> 26:01.902
Grace told me about the
exhibition game you're going to.

26:01.937 --> 26:03.904
She told you about that?

26:03.939 --> 26:06.039
Yeah, I ran into her
down at the consignment shop

26:06.074 --> 26:07.841
when she was trying
to sell her prom dress.

26:07.876 --> 26:09.876
Guess the dance is the same night, so...

26:10.386 --> 26:12.212
What? She won't be going?

26:12.247 --> 26:14.548
Well, it seems she'd
rather be with you instead.

26:15.057 --> 26:16.483
You know what?

26:16.518 --> 26:18.552
I am gonna get you some carrot cake too.

26:18.587 --> 26:20.554
It's good for your eyes,
so you don't lose sight

26:20.589 --> 26:22.656
of all those high fly balls
in the lights.

26:22.691 --> 26:24.274
Thanks.

26:30.239 --> 26:31.831
Are you sure this is the right address?

26:31.867 --> 26:33.700
It's the one I was given.

26:33.735 --> 26:35.569
Well, nobody's living here now.

26:35.604 --> 26:37.404
Can I help you find something?

26:37.439 --> 26:40.206
Hi. Yeah, we were looking
for somebody that we thought

26:40.242 --> 26:42.242
- might live here.
- Karen Zarish.

26:42.277 --> 26:45.412
Mrs. Zarish. I remember her.
She and her husband owned

26:45.447 --> 26:48.181
the house that was there
when I was a kid, but they moved

26:48.216 --> 26:50.016
- after the fire.
- Oh, there was a fire?

26:50.052 --> 26:51.885
It was pretty scary. They just barely

26:51.920 --> 26:53.720
made it out but lost everything.

26:53.755 --> 26:55.305
- Oh.
- Everything?

26:56.158 --> 26:58.692
That lot's been vacant ever
since the Zarishes moved away,

26:58.727 --> 27:00.794
until about two months ago.

27:01.145 --> 27:03.059
Do you know where they moved to?

27:03.094 --> 27:05.315
Sorry, we just barely knew them.

27:05.691 --> 27:07.272
- Well, thanks.
- What kind of flowers

27:08.333 --> 27:10.937
- are those?
- Cyclamens.

27:10.973 --> 27:13.273
They're a beautiful colour.

27:16.311 --> 27:18.578
As you can see,
the potential of the space

27:18.614 --> 27:21.481
is virtually unlimited.
Now, it would make

27:21.516 --> 27:24.618
a wonderful destination
for dining and entertainment,

27:24.653 --> 27:26.653
especially for someone
who had the foresight

27:26.688 --> 27:28.622
- to buy a condominium here.
- Do you know

27:28.657 --> 27:32.058
- who the original designer was?
- Actually, I don't,

27:32.094 --> 27:35.228
but there are architectural
surprises around every corner.

27:35.263 --> 27:37.263
Has she told you

27:37.299 --> 27:39.132
about the ghost?

27:39.167 --> 27:41.968
This mill comes with its
very own restless spirit.

27:42.004 --> 27:45.105
Nobody told us that this
structure would be haunted.

27:45.140 --> 27:47.641
Oh, well that's just an old wives' tale.

27:47.676 --> 27:50.477
It's the tale of an angry
and rejected wife.

27:50.512 --> 27:52.646
They say that when
her spirit is strongest,

27:52.681 --> 27:55.315
white tulips grow
in the very spot where she died

27:55.350 --> 27:58.418
as a symbol of her eternal grief.

27:58.952 --> 28:01.488
Well, we don't need to concern ourselves

28:01.523 --> 28:03.323
with myths and legends.

28:03.358 --> 28:06.259
Now, the next thing I want to
show you is a space that could

28:06.294 --> 28:08.662
serve as a courtyard.
And so it's just up here,

28:08.697 --> 28:10.830
if you'll follow me through this room.

28:10.866 --> 28:12.999
As you can see on your left,

28:13.035 --> 28:16.136
they've preserved some
of the original mill machinery

28:16.171 --> 28:18.138
that adds to the rustic feel of the room,

28:18.173 --> 28:20.440
and leads directly to the...

28:20.475 --> 28:22.809
tulips.

28:22.844 --> 28:25.011
Wow. You'd have to check

28:25.047 --> 28:27.013
the story, but I'm pretty sure

28:27.049 --> 28:29.149
that this is the exact spot

28:29.184 --> 28:31.017
where she laid down every night

28:31.053 --> 28:33.278
waiting for her husband to return.

28:33.722 --> 28:36.322
I don't know about you,
but I wouldn't want to live

28:36.358 --> 28:39.325
in a haunted mill.
And I can't imagine anyone

28:39.361 --> 28:41.861
would want to buy a condo here either.

28:54.476 --> 28:56.854
Hey, when you moved here from New York,

28:56.889 --> 28:59.054
weren't you kind of dating a girl?

29:00.683 --> 29:03.016
Janine. Yeah.

29:04.620 --> 29:06.787
Well, whatever happened with you and her?

29:06.822 --> 29:10.591
Well, we... we tried
to keep things going,

29:10.626 --> 29:12.726
but then it just kind of fizzled out.

29:13.944 --> 29:15.395
Why?

29:15.431 --> 29:16.930
It wasn't fair to her.

29:16.966 --> 29:18.732
I was here in this new place,

29:18.767 --> 29:20.601
and I didn't want to stop her

29:20.636 --> 29:22.603
from living her life, so...

29:22.638 --> 29:25.572
we just flipped things back
to us being friends.

29:26.999 --> 29:28.333
Hmm.

29:30.579 --> 29:32.184
I hope you're gonna throw it
harder than that

29:32.219 --> 29:34.548
- when you're at Fordham.
- Of course I will...

29:34.583 --> 29:37.451
because I'll be throwing at
somebody who can actually catch.

29:37.486 --> 29:39.586
Oh, OK. OK.

29:51.481 --> 29:52.766
Are you doing OK?

29:52.801 --> 29:54.635
Yeah, I'll be all right.

29:55.444 --> 29:57.237
I know how much you wanted that dress.

29:57.272 --> 29:59.640
- I'll find something to wear.
- Hmm.

30:00.699 --> 30:03.644
But I did find
some other things that I want.

30:03.679 --> 30:06.813
I loved the colour
of the flowers we saw today

30:06.849 --> 30:08.814
for our wedding, the cyclamens.

30:08.849 --> 30:10.450
Hmm.

30:10.486 --> 30:12.544
And...

30:12.593 --> 30:14.527
I would like a harpist to play.

30:16.759 --> 30:19.126
And I learned about this great
idea where we write each other

30:19.161 --> 30:21.194
letters the night before we get married

30:21.230 --> 30:23.664
and we read them
on our first anniversary.

30:23.699 --> 30:26.633
I love that. All of that.

30:26.669 --> 30:28.835
And it doesn't matter
what I end up wearing,

30:28.871 --> 30:30.671
because everyone's gonna be looking

30:30.706 --> 30:32.673
at the good-looking groom
standing next to me.

30:32.708 --> 30:34.675
Where are you gonna find him?

30:34.710 --> 30:37.010
Oh, wait. That's me.

30:47.389 --> 30:49.222
Here you go.

30:49.258 --> 30:52.025
- Oh, good morning.
- Well, it was

30:52.061 --> 30:54.628
before Martha called.
Those people who wanted to buy

30:54.663 --> 30:56.663
the mill, they changed
their minds when they thought

30:56.699 --> 30:58.665
- it might be haunted.
- Oh, does that mean Phil

30:58.701 --> 31:01.301
- is gonna get it for sure?
- No. They decided they still

31:01.336 --> 31:03.470
wanna buy it, but now they wanna
tear it down and build

31:03.505 --> 31:06.473
luxury townhomes. I thought when
they saw the tulips I planted,

31:06.508 --> 31:09.710
- they'd give up and go running.
- You planted tulips?

31:10.185 --> 31:11.712
Is that what I said?

31:11.747 --> 31:13.847
Uh, yeah. Exactly that.

31:13.882 --> 31:16.383
Well, it was in memory of that poor woman

31:16.418 --> 31:19.753
who haunts the place. Now, no
one's gonna remember her at all.

31:19.788 --> 31:21.722
Doesn't the city council

31:21.757 --> 31:23.724
still have to approve
which bid to accept?

31:23.759 --> 31:25.726
Yes, but the other offer
is higher than Phil's,

31:25.761 --> 31:28.195
and it's too late to submit a new one.

31:28.870 --> 31:30.864
- Good morning.
- Yeah, whatever.

31:34.870 --> 31:37.838
So I woke up this morning and
realized I'm all out of eggs.

31:37.873 --> 31:40.707
- Oh.
- And bread and coffee...

31:40.743 --> 31:43.176
Well, I have all that
around here somewhere.

31:43.212 --> 31:45.345
Good. I did manage to add another page

31:45.380 --> 31:47.611
- to my guest list though.
- Another whole page?

31:47.646 --> 31:50.617
Yeah. That thing's like
the Blob, it just keeps growing.

31:50.652 --> 31:53.754
Yeah, mine's starting
to look kind of Blob-like too.

31:53.789 --> 31:56.757
Is that really how we want
our wedding to be,

31:56.792 --> 31:59.226
with so many people there
that we hardly have time

31:59.261 --> 32:01.751
- to connect with any of them?
- Well, maybe we should start over.

32:01.786 --> 32:03.730
Just write down
the people that we're sure

32:03.766 --> 32:05.632
- we want there.
- Yeah, then we can compare

32:05.667 --> 32:08.347
- our lists when we're done.
- Yeah. Hey, you made waffles!

32:08.382 --> 32:10.495
Good. I'm out of those too.

32:13.368 --> 32:15.635
So, how far is New York from Middleton?

32:15.811 --> 32:19.112
921 miles.

32:19.148 --> 32:21.281
OK, so that's not so far.

32:21.316 --> 32:25.118
I mean, if I had a car
that went 900 miles per hour.

32:29.181 --> 32:31.224
You know, Grace...

32:32.184 --> 32:35.270
you don't have to put your life
on hold for me.

32:36.484 --> 32:38.884
I'm not putting my life on hold.

32:39.858 --> 32:41.977
You already decided
not to go to the prom.

32:43.403 --> 32:44.813
How did you know that?

32:45.530 --> 32:48.016
It's a small town. Everybody talks.

32:48.051 --> 32:50.952
Yeah, I mean, I... I just decided.

32:51.661 --> 32:53.688
I mean, if you're not going to be here,

32:53.724 --> 32:55.657
then who am I gonna go with?

32:55.692 --> 32:58.827
You could go with a group
of friends, or...

32:58.862 --> 33:00.929
I don't know. Somebody.

33:01.505 --> 33:04.666
But I wanted to go with you.

33:04.701 --> 33:06.385
And I want you to go.

33:09.099 --> 33:10.389
Yeah.

33:11.807 --> 33:14.843
I... guess I could do that.

33:16.017 --> 33:17.562
Good.

33:20.851 --> 33:22.817
You know, Grace...

33:23.568 --> 33:25.320
things are gonna change.

33:26.488 --> 33:27.718
Eventually.

33:30.108 --> 33:31.493
I know.

33:33.453 --> 33:36.412
Just not right now. OK?

33:38.640 --> 33:39.868
OK.

33:43.907 --> 33:45.707
Where are you going?

33:45.742 --> 33:47.876
You know, I still haven't
been able to get you

33:47.911 --> 33:50.011
- all the way around.
- That is because that's

33:50.047 --> 33:52.013
- never going to happen.
- And that sounds like

33:52.049 --> 33:54.015
a challenge.

33:57.254 --> 33:59.554
- It's not gonna happen.
- Let me try again.

33:59.590 --> 34:01.556
- No, no, no!
- That was a bad one.

34:01.592 --> 34:03.858
Just give me a push.

34:10.455 --> 34:12.900
<i>Very well, then. The motion passes.</i>

34:12.936 --> 34:15.337
The Middleton seal will
be changed ever so slightly

34:15.371 --> 34:18.406
to more accurately reflect
our history. Let it be so.

34:18.442 --> 34:21.710
Now, onto the next order
of business, voting to decide

34:21.745 --> 34:23.911
which bid to approve for the old mill.

34:23.947 --> 34:26.181
- Madam Mayor.
- Abigail?

34:26.216 --> 34:28.283
This is a closed meeting.

34:28.318 --> 34:30.385
Have you approved the bid
for the mill yet?

34:30.420 --> 34:32.587
- We were just about to.
- Well, I think you're gonna

34:32.623 --> 34:34.922
- wanna hear what I have to say.
- Well, I guess I could go

34:34.958 --> 34:37.926
against protocol since I'm
the one that makes it up.

34:37.960 --> 34:39.928
Come with me. Take five.

34:40.645 --> 34:42.297
Now, what is it that is so urgent

34:42.331 --> 34:44.199
that it just couldn't wait?

34:44.234 --> 34:46.400
Well, I went back to the mill
to dig up the tulips

34:46.436 --> 34:49.204
- that I planted...
- You planted those?!

34:49.239 --> 34:51.473
OK, I might have done
a little bit of gardening.

34:51.507 --> 34:53.275
But that's not the reason that I'm here.

34:53.310 --> 34:55.577
I was in the mill, looking around,

34:55.612 --> 34:57.279
sad that they were tearing it down,

34:57.314 --> 34:59.281
and I saw something
that I hadn't seen before.

34:59.316 --> 35:03.543
- The mill woman's ghost?
- No. Something better.

35:05.155 --> 35:07.722
- A bird carving?
- The same bird carving that

35:07.758 --> 35:10.625
Franklin Potts used to hide in
all the buildings he designed.

35:10.661 --> 35:12.627
I thought Franklin Potts
only designed buildings

35:12.663 --> 35:15.330
on the West Coast, very famous buildings.

35:15.365 --> 35:17.098
I guess he designed one in Middleton too.

35:17.134 --> 35:19.968
Well, if a renowned architect
like Franklin Potts designed

35:20.003 --> 35:23.638
the old mill, then that would
make it an historic landmark.

35:23.674 --> 35:26.174
Which is something you can't tear down...

35:26.209 --> 35:28.643
so I guess the city would
have to accept the only bid

35:28.679 --> 35:30.745
that proposed to leave
the exterior intact.

35:30.781 --> 35:33.615
And that would be Phil Sturgess' plan...

35:33.650 --> 35:35.317
Is it? Hmm.

35:35.352 --> 35:38.153
Well, it looks like
it's a good day for him then.

35:49.644 --> 35:52.011
We have to stop meeting like this.

35:52.047 --> 35:53.646
Yes.

35:53.682 --> 35:56.416
You know, you forget
how small Middleton is

35:56.451 --> 35:58.484
until you go out and see the same people

35:58.520 --> 36:00.486
- over and over again.
- Right.

36:00.522 --> 36:03.456
- Are you here with Paul?
- Oh, no.

36:03.491 --> 36:05.491
We hung out a couple of times,

36:05.527 --> 36:07.293
but we didn't really connect.

36:07.329 --> 36:09.295
He would definitely not be interested

36:09.331 --> 36:11.297
in seeing someone play
the classical guitar.

36:11.333 --> 36:13.666
- Well, then that's his loss.
- Yeah.

36:13.702 --> 36:15.668
Oh, thank you.

36:15.704 --> 36:17.670
So, should I save you a seat?

36:17.706 --> 36:19.939
Oh, uh...

36:19.975 --> 36:22.642
- Are you ready to go inside?
- Just about.

36:22.677 --> 36:24.644
- Stephanie, this is Krista.
- Oh.

36:24.679 --> 36:26.512
- Uh, hello.
- Hi.

36:26.548 --> 36:29.515
- Would you like something to drink?
- No, thanks.

36:29.551 --> 36:32.819
- OK. I'll take one. Thanks.
- Ahem.

36:32.854 --> 36:34.721
- It was nice to meet you.
- You too.

36:34.756 --> 36:36.656
- Enjoy.
- OK.

36:44.699 --> 36:46.688
Phil.

36:47.569 --> 36:50.427
- You're back.
- Yeah.

36:50.463 --> 36:51.838
Um...

36:51.873 --> 36:55.266
I have some big news.

36:55.302 --> 36:57.919
I kind of have some news too.

36:57.955 --> 37:01.381
- You won the bid.
- I what?

37:01.416 --> 37:03.149
For the mill.

37:03.184 --> 37:05.051
You can put your company
headquarters there.

37:05.086 --> 37:07.353
Oh. I wasn't sure that was

37:07.389 --> 37:09.689
- gonna get approved so quickly.
- Well...

37:10.462 --> 37:12.922
things just kind of happen in Middleton.

37:13.361 --> 37:15.561
Yeah, but, um...

37:16.593 --> 37:17.730
I found a place

37:17.766 --> 37:20.400
in, uh... Portland.

37:21.745 --> 37:23.091
A place for what?

37:23.116 --> 37:25.249
For my company's headquarters.

37:26.408 --> 37:28.408
I didn't know you were even looking.

37:28.443 --> 37:31.210
I wasn't... really,
but I found this campus

37:31.246 --> 37:33.379
that's just perfect.
I mean, it's laid out

37:33.415 --> 37:36.582
in exactly the way
I want my company to grow,

37:36.618 --> 37:38.685
and Portland already has
the infrastructure of talent

37:38.720 --> 37:40.742
for me to staff things up.

37:42.327 --> 37:44.577
But you said you really liked Middleton.

37:44.612 --> 37:48.079
I did. I mean, I... I do.

37:48.084 --> 37:51.166
But this is what's best
for my company, so...

37:53.922 --> 37:55.635
So you're gonna be leaving.

37:56.049 --> 37:57.676
Tomorrow morning.

37:58.640 --> 38:00.959
I'm... I'm sorry, Abigail.

38:00.994 --> 38:03.132
I know we kind of had
something started here, but...

38:03.168 --> 38:04.777
I have investors to think about

38:04.813 --> 38:07.613
- and people who work for me.
- Of course.

38:08.520 --> 38:11.658
But I like you... a lot.

38:11.693 --> 38:14.120
But you have to do what's best
for your company.

38:15.276 --> 38:16.778
Right.

38:19.260 --> 38:20.657
OK then.

38:21.783 --> 38:23.429
OK. Um...

38:23.465 --> 38:25.631
Thank you for everything,
and if you're ever in Portland...

38:25.667 --> 38:27.633
I probably won't be.

38:41.282 --> 38:44.392
<i> Do you wanna start?</i>

38:44.428 --> 38:46.179
<i> No. You go.</i>

38:46.214 --> 38:48.572
- OK. I have Nick first.
- And Grace.

38:48.607 --> 38:51.090
And then Liam, Abigail and Stephanie.

38:51.126 --> 38:52.959
Yeah, they were next on my list.

38:52.994 --> 38:55.198
- OK. And Eve, Martha and Tom.
- All right.

38:55.233 --> 38:58.431
- And Brandon, Tara and Laurie.
- Yeah, I have them too.

38:58.466 --> 39:01.200
And then I put down Olympia
and your foster mom.

39:01.236 --> 39:03.336
I have your sister and your parents.

39:03.371 --> 39:06.372
And... we wrote down all the same people.

39:06.408 --> 39:08.841
Oh! Look at that.

39:08.877 --> 39:10.643
So we can send out invitations tomorrow.

39:10.678 --> 39:13.212
We can, now that we're
on exactly the same page.

39:15.216 --> 39:17.683
Grace, hey. Did you and Noah
have a good time

39:17.719 --> 39:19.685
- at the park?
- I guess.

39:20.717 --> 39:22.188
You know, I'm gonna get going.

39:22.223 --> 39:25.462
Just make sure we have all the
contact information we need, OK?

39:25.498 --> 39:27.794
- OK. See you soon.
- Bye.

39:29.397 --> 39:31.798
Well, what's going on?

39:31.833 --> 39:33.699
Nothing.

39:33.735 --> 39:35.701
I mean, Noah and I just started talking

39:35.737 --> 39:37.904
about how things were
gonna be after we graduate.

39:37.939 --> 39:40.072
And how are they gonna be?

39:41.743 --> 39:43.072
I don't know.

39:45.116 --> 39:47.346
Well, you've still got
the rest of your senior year.

39:47.382 --> 39:48.881
Yeah...

39:48.917 --> 39:50.683
and he said that he wants me
to still go to the prom

39:50.718 --> 39:52.718
- with some of my friends.
- Oh, yeah, you should.

39:52.754 --> 39:54.320
- That'll be fun.
- Yeah, if I can

39:54.355 --> 39:56.322
find a dress like the one
I already got rid of.

39:56.357 --> 39:59.225
- What?
- Oh, I took the one

39:59.260 --> 40:01.894
that I had bought to that
new store to have it sold.

40:01.930 --> 40:05.064
Oh. Hmm. Well, we should
go there together

40:05.099 --> 40:06.866
and see if we can find it.

40:06.901 --> 40:09.569
You think it'll still be there?

40:09.604 --> 40:12.104
I think we'll find things we both like.

40:13.056 --> 40:14.173
Yeah.

40:15.090 --> 40:16.843
OK.

40:21.382 --> 40:23.349
Oh, hello. You're back again.

40:23.384 --> 40:26.055
Hi. Yes, I am, and I'm hoping

40:26.091 --> 40:27.753
that you still have
that dress that I brought you.

40:27.789 --> 40:29.522
I'm pretty sure I do,

40:29.557 --> 40:32.558
although I don't remember
exactly where I hung it.

40:32.594 --> 40:34.727
If it is in here, I will find it.

40:34.762 --> 40:36.729
- OK.
- Thank you.

40:36.764 --> 40:38.865
OK. Well, let's look.

40:41.002 --> 40:42.768
Now, why don't you look in here?

40:42.804 --> 40:45.189
- I'll look in the back.
- Mm-hmm. OK.

40:54.315 --> 40:56.282
Oh, yes!

41:07.662 --> 41:09.996
- Mom?
- Mm-hmm?

41:13.329 --> 41:15.668
I think I found something.
