00:00.747 --> 00:02.181
Previously on <i>Royal Pains...</i>

00:02.183 --> 00:03.716
Evan and I have reached an impasse

00:03.718 --> 00:05.718
in our differences over Hankmed.

00:05.720 --> 00:07.486
- Hank quit.
- It's not that simple.

00:07.488 --> 00:09.755
But not to worry, I'm gonna
keep Hankmed running.

00:09.757 --> 00:13.726
Gentlemen, welcome to Hankmed...2.0.

00:13.728 --> 00:16.228
I want us to have a relationship

00:16.230 --> 00:17.797
like we used to.

00:17.799 --> 00:20.066
Your father wouldn't
understand... he'd be furious.

00:20.068 --> 00:21.534
He wouldn't have to know.

00:21.536 --> 00:25.271
I have decided that I am going
to work for both of you.

00:25.273 --> 00:27.440
- That's not a choice!
- That's not a choice!

00:27.442 --> 00:31.010
Sorry to disturb you,
but your sons need you.

00:31.012 --> 00:33.212
We all need you.

00:36.483 --> 00:39.352
Pull! [Gunshot]

00:39.354 --> 00:42.254
You're letting it beat the barrel.

00:42.256 --> 00:45.491
Lead it more, Hank. Pull!

00:45.493 --> 00:47.360
[Gunshot]

00:47.362 --> 00:50.429
- Nice.
- It clears the mind.

00:50.431 --> 00:54.266
You have a lot on your mind?

00:54.268 --> 00:56.469
Marisa insisted we inspect for mold

00:56.471 --> 00:58.204
for Carlos's sake.

00:58.206 --> 01:00.806
Apparently, ventilation work
begins at dawn.

01:00.808 --> 01:02.508
That's a lot of ventilating.

01:02.510 --> 01:05.811
Yeah, a minor project
compared to something called...

01:05.813 --> 01:11.050
<i>Kindersicherung...</i>
Uh, babyproofing... everything.

01:11.052 --> 01:12.685
It's mad.

01:12.687 --> 01:15.354
Where's Costello?

01:15.356 --> 01:17.123
Your sidekick, the funny one.

01:17.125 --> 01:18.691
My invitation was to you both.

01:18.693 --> 01:20.793
Evan's pretty busy these days.

01:20.795 --> 01:22.628
I don't see much of him.

01:22.630 --> 01:25.030
Nothing I need concern
myself with, I trust.

01:25.032 --> 01:27.833
Nope, we're good. Pull!

01:27.835 --> 01:29.368
[Gunshot]
Ah.

01:29.370 --> 01:30.703
That felt better.

01:30.705 --> 01:33.806
As opposed to life itself, Hank,

01:33.808 --> 01:36.942
skeet shooting affords us the opportunity

01:36.944 --> 01:41.247
to anticipate our targets.

01:41.249 --> 01:44.784

It's called <i>Life?</i>

01:57.398 --> 02:03.035
<i>L.I.F.E...</i> Life is for enjoying.

02:03.037 --> 02:04.603
You know, once I came up with the title,

02:04.605 --> 02:06.005
it basically wrote itself.

02:06.007 --> 02:07.106
I didn't know that you were a writer.

02:07.108 --> 02:08.841
Neither did I.

02:08.842 --> 02:11.510
I just started a self-help blog in prison.

02:11.512 --> 02:15.448
Wow, are there a lot
of lost souls in <i>there!</i>

02:15.450 --> 02:18.384
It turns out the my message
has broad appeal.

02:18.386 --> 02:20.252
And, Eddie, I wish you luck with it.

02:20.254 --> 02:22.788
But if we could get back
to the crisis at hand...

02:22.790 --> 02:24.824
No, the book is <i>for</i> the boys.

02:24.826 --> 02:26.258
I realized that all the guidance

02:26.260 --> 02:27.993
I was giving to everybody else

02:27.995 --> 02:31.063
was in preparation
for those I love the most.

02:31.065 --> 02:33.599
Your book is going to resurrect Hankmed?

02:33.601 --> 02:36.035
Hankmed, no Hankmed, it doesn't matter.

02:36.037 --> 02:37.470
I just want the boys to be happy.

02:37.472 --> 02:39.104
I'm really worried that...

02:39.106 --> 02:41.474
Excuse me, you are way more than worried.

02:41.476 --> 02:42.908
You are distraught.

02:42.910 --> 02:45.478
You know that a person
cannot help another person enjoy

02:45.480 --> 02:49.448
unless they are <i>in joy</i> themselves?

02:49.450 --> 02:51.550
It's chapter six.

02:51.552 --> 02:53.752
When was the last time you had a day off?

02:53.754 --> 02:55.955
Oh, I mean, I've been
too scared to leave them alone.

02:55.957 --> 02:59.258
Mm-hmm. All right,
look at me... listen to me.

02:59.260 --> 03:03.562
You take the day off, I will handle this.

03:03.564 --> 03:05.664
- How does that sound?
- Like a godsend.

03:05.666 --> 03:07.366
But I hope that...

03:07.368 --> 03:09.368
Hope? Did I hear the word "hope"?

03:09.370 --> 03:11.237
Already you're better. You see that?

03:11.239 --> 03:14.139
You keep things in a positive perspective,

03:14.141 --> 03:16.275
they just fall right into place.

03:16.277 --> 03:17.576
Always do.

03:17.578 --> 03:21.080
Well, look at that. Right on cue.

03:21.082 --> 03:24.450
See? The boys will love this!

03:28.822 --> 03:30.656
Yeah, yeah, I get that you don't cover

03:30.658 --> 03:32.124
elective procedures,

03:32.126 --> 03:35.361
but my patient didn't <i>elect</i>
to herniate a disc.

03:35.363 --> 03:37.663
But Van Dyke ordered kenalog.
What do you want...

03:37.665 --> 03:40.633
- Oh, hold on one second.
- No...

03:40.635 --> 03:43.802
Yo, Van Dyke. So Jeremiah now says that

03:43.804 --> 03:45.304
indometha-something is better.

03:45.306 --> 03:47.406
No, an MRI is not cosmetic...

03:47.408 --> 03:49.408
he says... he says the patient
has a history of peptic ulcers.

03:49.410 --> 03:51.110
Which, actually, is what I'm gonna have...

03:51.112 --> 03:52.978
- Hi, Evan.
- Hi, Hank.

03:52.980 --> 03:54.680
Both: Let me call you back.

03:54.682 --> 03:58.717
- What?
- Dad. Hey...

03:58.719 --> 04:01.787
Ah, duh, duh, duh, duh, duh. Come here.

04:01.789 --> 04:03.122
- Duh, duh, duh.
- Dad...

04:03.124 --> 04:05.190
Come here. We're huggin'.

04:05.192 --> 04:07.126
- Okay. Dad?
- Yes?

04:07.128 --> 04:08.360
What are you doing here?

04:08.362 --> 04:10.095
Well, I had some business in the city,

04:10.097 --> 04:12.164
and I thought I would
swing by and see my boys.

04:12.166 --> 04:14.767
- Florida agrees with you.
- Yeah. And grandpa...

04:14.769 --> 04:17.269
He never agrees with me,
but that's his way.

04:17.271 --> 04:19.338
[Chuckles]
How about you?

04:19.339 --> 04:21.106
- Anything new?
- Uh...

04:21.108 --> 04:25.611
Well, uh, dad, we need
to catch up on some things.

04:25.613 --> 04:28.514
Right.

04:28.516 --> 04:29.949
You should sit down, dad.

04:34.554 --> 04:35.921
Okay.

04:35.923 --> 04:38.657
Um, first of all, we love you.

04:38.659 --> 04:40.025
And we want you to know that

04:40.027 --> 04:42.328
Evan and I will always be family.

04:42.330 --> 04:44.296
But in our business, there have been

04:44.298 --> 04:46.398
- some ups and downs.
- Hank quit.

04:46.400 --> 04:49.068
We agreed to go our separate ways.

04:49.070 --> 04:53.138
And nobody picked up a phone.

04:53.140 --> 04:56.375
I... guess nobody wanted to disappoint you.

04:56.377 --> 04:58.978
How could I be disappointed
if you're happy?

04:58.980 --> 05:02.181
Are you? Are you happy?

05:02.183 --> 05:04.650
Yeah, I am.

05:04.652 --> 05:05.784
Oh, yeah.

05:05.786 --> 05:07.152
- Oh, that's great.
- That's great.

05:07.154 --> 05:09.254
Because I think we can have a lot of fun.

05:09.256 --> 05:10.623
[Cell phone chimes]
Remember in the old days

05:10.625 --> 05:13.225
when we used to sneak into
those double features,

05:13.227 --> 05:15.761
huh, that mom labeled, what, "too scary"?

05:15.763 --> 05:19.264
I do, but I don't have time
for the movies, dad.

05:19.266 --> 05:20.566
I'll text you about lunch.

05:20.568 --> 05:22.668
All right, I understand. Go save lives.

05:22.670 --> 05:24.770
So how about my little one? Huh?

05:24.772 --> 05:26.872
Icees and popcorn on me.

05:26.874 --> 05:28.273
"Little one," really?

05:28.275 --> 05:29.608
Dad, no, I'm booked. Come on.

05:29.610 --> 05:31.043
Well, play hooky.

05:31.045 --> 05:32.611
You were always good at playing hooky.

05:32.613 --> 05:35.180
- Do I look dressed for hooky?
- No.

05:35.182 --> 05:37.716
Today I sign the Blackstone as a retainer.

05:37.718 --> 05:40.753
- The Blackstone, dad.
- I'm so proud of you.

05:40.755 --> 05:42.421
All right. Have a good time.

05:42.423 --> 05:44.056
All right. I'll call you later.

05:46.660 --> 05:48.527
I don't know what's happening to him.

05:48.529 --> 05:52.097
[Man gasping]
Somebody help. Call 911.

05:52.099 --> 05:55.134
I'm a doctor. Excuse me. What happened?

05:55.136 --> 05:58.203
- Help him.
- Is this blood fake?

05:58.205 --> 06:00.605
Yes, but he's really choking on it.

06:00.630 --> 06:02.930
He can't breathe, give him room, please.

What's this fake blood made of?

06:41.215 --> 06:42.480
He was trying a new recipe...

06:42.482 --> 06:44.115
peanut butter, molasses, food coloring.

06:44.117 --> 06:46.117
I need to create some suction
to get it out of there.

Uh... hey!

Sorry. Thank you.

08:30.490 --> 08:32.157
guess who showed up from Florida.

08:32.159 --> 08:34.926
- No, don't tell me.
- Yep, unannounced.

08:34.928 --> 08:37.261
"Hello, boys." Just showed up.

08:37.264 --> 08:40.198
- Did that bother you?
- No, I'm happy.

08:40.200 --> 08:42.900
It's just he and Hank sometimes treat me

08:42.903 --> 08:44.703
like a lost puppy...

which I'm not... at all.

Oh. Are you sure you don't have time

09:22.042 --> 09:23.608
for a quick double feature?

09:23.610 --> 09:25.310
A double feat... dad,

09:25.312 --> 09:27.145
a double feature's, like,
four hours of movies.

09:27.147 --> 09:30.181
George Romero's classics fly by. Come on.

09:30.183 --> 09:32.050
George Romero... that must be
a tie-in with the race.

09:32.052 --> 09:33.852
You mean the one
with the zombies chasing you?

09:33.854 --> 09:37.122
- I saw that flyer.
- Yeah. Yeah.

09:37.124 --> 09:38.423
We should do it.

09:38.425 --> 09:40.291
- The race?
- Yes.

09:40.293 --> 09:42.260
Oh, you're gonna run a 5K?

No, I'll be a zombie... a slow one.

09:44.197 --> 09:46.598

09:46.600 --> 09:49.200
when we all dressed up
as our favorite monsters?

Oh, yeah, yeah. You were Frankenstein,

- mom was your bride.
- Right.

I was the Wolfman, and Evan was

09:53.240 --> 09:55.440
a ninja pirate zombie robot.

09:55.442 --> 09:57.008
Shouldn't I sign us up?

09:57.010 --> 09:58.877
Uh... no.

- It'll be fun.
- No.

turned some blog into a book?

10:04.084 --> 10:06.451

- Oh.

- I sent you the link.
- Yeah, yeah, right.

10:08.255 --> 10:09.821
- Of course. Okay.
- So that's why I'm here.

- I'm going to meet publishers.
- Great. That's great.

- Thank you.
- Yeah.

I want you boys to read it.

Notice I marked the chapter
all about when you were young.

10:20.033 --> 10:21.266
- Mm-hmm.
- Okay?

10:21.268 --> 10:22.767
So that there are no surprises.

10:22.769 --> 10:25.637
I gave Evan his this morning,
and this one is for you.

10:25.639 --> 10:27.806
Thank you. I will take a look.

No, uh...

12:03.904 --> 12:06.471
No, just a phone. I ran out of gas, so...

12:06.473 --> 12:07.872
Sure you did.

12:07.874 --> 12:12.710
Go on, then, if you don't mind
spooks listening in.

12:12.712 --> 12:16.381
Or I could try neighbors too, you know.

12:16.383 --> 12:18.483
You have any neighbors?

12:18.485 --> 12:21.386
Well, we did, but they're dead.

12:21.388 --> 12:25.189
[Nervous chuckle]
Maybe I should just go.

12:25.191 --> 12:27.525
I... I think I'm gonna go.
I'm just gonna go.

12:27.527 --> 12:28.660
Thanks a lot, though.

- I'm fine, yeah.
- I didn't see you.

I'm fine, grandpa.

- Oh, no.

I can have a doctor out here
to look at that.

I'm worried about my grandpa.

He... doesn't seem like himself to me.

I mean, did he seem a little weird to you?

Definitely not a little weird.

14:34.754 --> 14:35.920
as a person who served their time,

14:35.922 --> 14:37.955
I am a changed person.

I'd like to put our past behind us.

16:22.492 --> 16:25.626
only, he's not working,
which is bad enough.

16:25.628 --> 16:28.329

aren't like him at all.

He's even started venting
about his old job

16:33.670 --> 16:36.871
for the government,
which is kind of a no-no.

16:36.873 --> 16:39.040
Wait, what did he do for the government?

16:39.042 --> 16:41.342
Um, he was kind of famous.

with a blood panel.

17:44.007 --> 17:46.273
I do my own draws.

17:46.275 --> 17:48.075

can you let the doctor take your blood?

the three words from before?

mortal flesh traps to set

our hobbies in this project.

18:31.154 --> 18:34.722
But our real goal is
making a better world and...

18:34.724 --> 18:36.557
being together as much as possible.

18:36.559 --> 18:38.192
We're a team, first and foremost.

18:38.194 --> 18:39.226
What?
[imitates explosion]

18:39.228 --> 18:40.895
Well, it sounds like

18:40.897 --> 18:42.496

18:42.498 --> 18:44.198
And your heart's fine too.

18:44.200 --> 18:45.499
Oh, God, what a relief.

18:45.501 --> 18:48.402
So... what caused the pain?

18:48.404 --> 18:50.004
Well, I'm gonna draw
some blood for further tests,

18:50.006 --> 18:51.806
but let me ask... when you're in character,

18:51.808 --> 18:53.874
are you a stumbler or a runner?

18:53.876 --> 18:56.010
- Ah, you're a fan.
- Yeah.

18:56.012 --> 18:58.379
- I'm a runner.
- Do you eat before you run?

18:58.381 --> 19:00.247
During. And today it was ribs.

19:00.249 --> 19:01.749
Huh. Pegged you for a brain eater.

19:01.751 --> 19:03.717
In any case, pending further tests,

19:03.719 --> 19:05.086
I think you had heartburn.

19:05.088 --> 19:06.887
So I'll prescribe some antacids.

19:06.889 --> 19:08.556
- As for the ribs...
- Oh, they weren't human.

19:08.558 --> 19:09.723
Good to know, but next time,

19:09.725 --> 19:11.492
fully digest them before you run.

19:13.495 --> 19:15.563
- And there's one for you.
- Thank you.

19:17.999 --> 19:20.901
Thank you.

19:20.903 --> 19:22.803
Go on, be adventurous.

19:28.443 --> 19:30.077
So?

19:30.079 --> 19:31.545
Not bad.

19:31.547 --> 19:33.447
[Both laugh]
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

19:33.449 --> 19:35.616
- You think they have any cumin?
- Mom!

19:35.618 --> 19:38.052
[Laughs]

19:38.054 --> 19:40.254
What made you change your mind
about getting together?

19:40.256 --> 19:43.424
I missed you.

19:43.426 --> 19:44.725
I'd hoped seeing you at Harborfest would

19:44.727 --> 19:46.260
soften your father's heart,

19:46.262 --> 19:48.062
but you know how stubborn he can be.

19:48.064 --> 19:50.965
I know how hard it is for you
to do anything behind his back.

19:50.967 --> 19:53.534
But for our sake,

19:53.536 --> 19:57.138
I'm glad you're taking this risk.

19:57.140 --> 19:59.807
Evan swears he's finally home.

19:59.809 --> 20:01.408
He just drove past the guard house.

20:01.410 --> 20:03.410
I'm glad he made it through.

20:03.412 --> 20:07.515
Hey, how's your relationship
with your landlord these days?

20:07.517 --> 20:09.383
- Boris? Why, what happened?
- Nothing.

20:09.385 --> 20:10.851
Nothing. I just want to make sure

20:10.853 --> 20:12.786
that you stay
on his right side, that's all.

20:12.788 --> 20:13.954
Well, the best way to do that

20:13.956 --> 20:16.390
is not to gossip about him.

20:16.392 --> 20:18.425
- Absolutely.
- Good.

20:18.427 --> 20:19.727
What's with all the Chinese?

20:19.729 --> 20:20.928
I thought that Evan was making dinner.

20:20.930 --> 20:22.596
No. Evan doesn't have time to cook.

20:22.598 --> 20:24.131
He's too busy growing his empire..

20:24.133 --> 20:28.068
Oh. What a shame. Evan so enjoys cooking.

20:28.070 --> 20:30.571
And life is for enjoying.

20:30.573 --> 20:32.573
You read it!

20:32.575 --> 20:34.675
Yeah. I only got through
the chapter you marked,

20:34.677 --> 20:36.644
but so far, it's great.

20:36.646 --> 20:38.212
- Yeah? Really? Thank you.
- Yeah.

20:38.214 --> 20:40.948
I... I didn't reveal anything
too personal, did I?

20:40.950 --> 20:42.716
Uh, it didn't seem personal.

20:42.718 --> 20:46.120
In fact, it seemed a little...

20:46.122 --> 20:47.254
fabricated.

20:47.256 --> 20:48.989
In what way?

20:48.991 --> 20:52.059
In the made up way.

20:52.061 --> 20:55.462
Exhibit "A." Here it is.

20:55.464 --> 20:59.166
"My eldest son was a reckless,
impulsive type."

20:59.168 --> 21:00.367
[Scoffs]

21:00.369 --> 21:02.469
"There was no danger he wouldn't ignore,"

21:02.471 --> 21:06.173
"no risky playground stunt
too silly to pull for a laugh."

21:06.175 --> 21:08.375
What? I think you confused me with Evan.

21:08.377 --> 21:09.810
And where do you think he got it from?

21:09.812 --> 21:12.213
He was imitating you,
and then you changed.

21:12.215 --> 21:14.848
And that's what the theme
of this chapter is about...

21:14.850 --> 21:16.116
change.

21:16.118 --> 21:17.851
Well, then, fine, no mad cow.

21:17.853 --> 21:19.954
Just listen to me,
I want Bulczynski's blood

21:19.956 --> 21:22.957
checked for everything humans can get.

21:22.959 --> 21:24.692
Good. Okay, bye.

21:24.694 --> 21:26.393
All right, sorry... sorry I'm late.

21:26.395 --> 21:28.562
Sorry I missed lunch.

21:28.564 --> 21:30.664
Did you just say "Bulczynski"?

21:30.666 --> 21:34.134
- Yes.
- Andreas Bulczynski?

21:34.136 --> 21:37.137
- Yeah.
- Is he a customer?

21:37.139 --> 21:38.973
He's a client. Why, you know him?

21:38.975 --> 21:40.507
[Scoffs] Do I know him?

21:40.509 --> 21:41.709
I mean, he was a whistle-blower

21:41.711 --> 21:43.143
before people knew there were whistles.

21:43.145 --> 21:46.046
He was the one that exposed
the lax security

21:46.048 --> 21:48.682
on Plum Island in the '80s.

21:48.684 --> 21:50.784
Is that the guy who
turned down the Nobel Prize?

21:50.786 --> 21:52.720
Yes. He would have been
bigger than Silkwood

21:52.722 --> 21:54.021
if Meryl Streep had played <i>him.</i>

21:54.023 --> 21:55.589
Wait, so he's still alive?

21:55.591 --> 21:57.191
Thanks to Hankmed, yeah.

21:57.193 --> 21:59.393
Did he have any Montauk monsters?

21:59.395 --> 22:02.463
Ehh, he didn't let us into the lab.

22:02.465 --> 22:04.498
Maybe we could all go out there,

22:04.500 --> 22:06.166
and you could introduce him to Hank.

22:06.168 --> 22:09.970
And I could get a blurb for my dust cover

22:09.972 --> 22:13.073
from a, you know, a former
<i>almost</i> Nobel Prize winner.

22:13.075 --> 22:15.643
Dad, I can't just take you
to Dr. Bulczynski's.

22:15.645 --> 22:17.311
Patient confidentiality... hello?

22:17.313 --> 22:20.014
Uh, you kinda let that cat
out of the bag already there,

22:20.016 --> 22:21.348
Mr. Chatty.

22:21.350 --> 22:24.218
Hey, why don't you tell us
a little bit about

22:24.220 --> 22:25.786
one of your new patients, Henry?

22:25.788 --> 22:27.788
Oh, um, because of a little thing called

22:27.790 --> 22:29.290
professionalism, Evan.

22:29.292 --> 22:32.793
Or because of a little thing
called you don't have any.

22:32.795 --> 22:34.561
Ouch. That almost stings.

22:34.563 --> 22:35.929
Yeah.

22:42.737 --> 22:44.705
What do you think this is called?

22:44.707 --> 22:47.708
Is this a prawn or a shrimp?

22:47.710 --> 22:49.877
Maybe it's a size thing.

22:49.879 --> 22:51.712
I mean, if it was a prawn,
it must be a big shrimp.

22:51.714 --> 22:53.547
And a big shrimp is a jumbo shrimp.

22:53.549 --> 22:56.116
So this is ju...

22:56.118 --> 22:57.584
what about those little guys?

22:57.586 --> 22:59.286
I like those little shrimp
on toast, you know,

22:59.288 --> 23:01.221
with mayonnaise and ketchup.

23:01.223 --> 23:03.157
And I love these in cocktail sauce.

23:03.159 --> 23:04.792
I wish we had cocktail sauce.
That doesn't go...

23:04.794 --> 23:06.894
really go with Chinese, does it?

23:06.896 --> 23:08.862
Anybody home?

23:13.970 --> 23:15.770
Uh-huh. Multitasking?

23:15.772 --> 23:17.272
No, Paige, I'm not.

23:17.274 --> 23:19.507
You have my undivided attention.

23:19.509 --> 23:21.743
Sincerely yours... I mean, sincerely.

23:21.745 --> 23:23.745
I just meant sincerely.
I'll call you when I'm done.

23:23.747 --> 23:27.215
Okay, bye.
[Sighs]

23:27.217 --> 23:28.516
[Thud] 
Damn it!

23:28.518 --> 23:29.718
- Are you okay?
- Oh...

23:29.720 --> 23:31.853
Oh, gosh, are you okay, grandpa?

23:31.855 --> 23:34.322
Here, he's opening the... here you go.

23:34.324 --> 23:37.592
Um, Nell, Dr. Bulczynski, what's going on?

23:37.594 --> 23:39.894
I'm so sorry. He was trying to feed Petri,

23:39.896 --> 23:41.096
and she nipped him.

23:41.098 --> 23:42.664
I called Dr. Sacani,

23:42.666 --> 23:44.933
and he said he would meet us here.

23:44.935 --> 23:48.003
Yeah, okay. Come on in. Come on in.

23:48.005 --> 23:52.240
Where are we?
This isn't a doctor's office!

23:52.242 --> 23:54.042
- Am I being put in a home?
- No, no, no.

23:54.044 --> 23:56.344
Grandpa, no, no.
Of course not, it's not a home.

23:56.346 --> 23:57.612
No, it's not that kind of home.

23:57.614 --> 23:59.447
Look, here's our medical stuff. See?

23:59.449 --> 24:01.216
And over there...
there's some more over there.

24:01.218 --> 24:02.984
I won't stay in a home.

24:02.986 --> 24:04.986
Nell, I thought you were on my side.

24:04.988 --> 24:07.222
I am. You know I am, grandpa.

24:07.224 --> 24:09.524
Uh, hey, is everything okay down here?

24:09.526 --> 24:10.892
Everything's fine. Just a little dog bite,

24:10.894 --> 24:12.627
and a doctor's on the way, so...

24:12.629 --> 24:15.130
Okay, there's also a doctor here, so...

24:15.132 --> 24:17.699
Hi. Dr. Lawson. You mind if I take a look?

24:17.701 --> 24:19.868
[Laughs]
Oh, sorry.

24:19.870 --> 24:24.572
I didn't meant to tickle you. Have a seat.

24:24.574 --> 24:26.608
Hi. Sorry I'm late.

24:26.610 --> 24:28.677
Oh, there's the dog bite, huh?

24:28.679 --> 24:32.213
Uh, yeah. Some bruising,
a couple small punctures.

24:32.215 --> 24:34.749
But it probably doesn't merit two doctors.

24:34.751 --> 24:37.752
Right, so... you can go back to sleep.

24:37.754 --> 24:40.555
- Okay.
- No, no, not you.

24:40.557 --> 24:42.757
Hank. Please.

24:42.759 --> 24:45.393
Uh, yeah, sure.
Looks like you got it covered.

24:45.395 --> 24:47.962
Um... there you go.

24:49.332 --> 24:51.333
You don't have to report this, do you?

24:51.335 --> 24:53.601
Well, are your dog's shots current?

24:53.603 --> 24:57.372
[Laughs]
I don't... I don't study dogs.

24:57.374 --> 25:00.442
Petri's shots are up to date.

25:00.444 --> 25:02.277
Has your dog bitten you before?

25:02.279 --> 25:04.312
That's... that's an old bite.

25:04.314 --> 25:07.382
New Guinea... with the Fore tribe.

25:07.384 --> 25:09.551
A tree kangaroo tangled with me.

25:09.553 --> 25:11.686
Well, I showed her how to dance...

25:11.688 --> 25:13.321
No, no, no, no. Shh.

25:13.323 --> 25:14.622
Ohh...

25:15.958 --> 25:17.058
Why is he like this?

25:17.060 --> 25:19.627
He's usually so quiet and in control.

25:19.629 --> 25:22.230
We can do a head CT.

25:24.200 --> 25:26.101
[Cell phone rings]

25:26.103 --> 25:28.103
[Sighs] Hey.

25:28.105 --> 25:30.338
Hey, have you seen dad?

25:30.340 --> 25:32.207
Ms. Newberg said he was cagey
about where he was headed,

25:32.209 --> 25:34.309
and his phone's been going
to voicemail all morning.

25:34.311 --> 25:37.178
I haven't heard from him,
but there's no signal

25:37.180 --> 25:38.580
out at Dr. Bulczynski's place.

25:38.582 --> 25:40.582
He wouldn't have gone there
to get, like, a blurb

25:40.584 --> 25:41.850
for his thing, would he?

25:41.852 --> 25:43.451
I want to say no, but I can't.

25:43.453 --> 25:46.087
Almost-Nobel-Prize winners
have that effect on dad.

25:46.089 --> 25:47.589
You want I should go check?

25:47.591 --> 25:49.290
Um, I don't know.

25:49.292 --> 25:51.326
Bulczynski's not crazy about intruders,

25:51.328 --> 25:52.794
and they don't really know you, so...

25:52.796 --> 25:57.799
I can handle it, okay? You're busy.

25:57.801 --> 26:01.703
- No, I'll meet you there.
- Fine.

26:05.307 --> 26:06.775
Here you are.

26:06.777 --> 26:08.877
I'm so glad you made it. Mwah.

26:08.879 --> 26:10.378
Your father had some sort of appointment,

26:10.380 --> 26:13.281
so I didn't even have to make an excuse.

26:13.283 --> 26:16.084
It's so great to see you taking a chance

26:16.086 --> 26:17.285
and doing what you want

26:17.287 --> 26:18.820
instead of what is expected of you.

26:18.822 --> 26:20.155
I've been dying to come here,

26:20.157 --> 26:22.290
but your father thought
it looked overpriced.

26:22.292 --> 26:23.558
Does this mean that I'm paying?

26:23.560 --> 26:28.296
To feel young, you must appear young.

26:28.298 --> 26:30.632
My father wasn't gray
until much later in his life...

26:30.634 --> 26:33.034
- No, over here.
- Ah.

26:33.036 --> 26:35.870
Unless he colored his hair too.

26:35.872 --> 26:37.972
Daddy dyes his hair? Did you know?

26:37.974 --> 26:40.241
This is a bad omen.

26:40.243 --> 26:42.777
We should never have done this.

26:42.779 --> 26:45.280
Of course we should have.

26:48.451 --> 26:49.984
Whoa...

26:53.722 --> 26:57.392
[Knocks on door]
Hello?

26:57.394 --> 26:59.394
You were right, this place is weird.

26:59.396 --> 27:01.896
Yeah. No sign of dad's car either.

27:01.898 --> 27:04.032
Well, that's a good thing.

27:04.034 --> 27:05.467
Yeah, unless they already got rid of it.

27:05.469 --> 27:06.734
Really?

27:06.736 --> 27:09.137
Come on, let's try over here.

27:23.652 --> 27:27.121
Shh.

27:35.664 --> 27:39.734
[Chuckles]

27:39.736 --> 27:42.904
Hank, are these human organs?

27:44.006 --> 27:45.340
Looks like heads...

27:45.342 --> 27:47.141
these are shrunken heads? What?

27:47.143 --> 27:50.144
Of cauliflower. You didn't let me finish.

27:50.146 --> 27:52.580
Oh.

27:52.582 --> 27:54.148
I'm gonna say dad's not here.

27:54.150 --> 27:57.151
Yeah. Great.

27:57.153 --> 27:58.786
Wonderful.

27:58.788 --> 28:00.622
I'm sure glad I cancelled
the Blackstone for this.

28:00.624 --> 28:02.123
Don't look at me.
I told you I could handle it.

28:02.125 --> 28:03.858
I wasn't looking at you. I was just...

28:03.860 --> 28:05.159
why is it always about you?

28:05.161 --> 28:07.328
It isn't, except in your head.

28:07.330 --> 28:08.796
How were we in business together?

28:08.798 --> 28:10.632
I mean, we can't even be in the same room.

28:10.634 --> 28:13.701
Good question. [Door rattles]

28:13.703 --> 28:16.337
What?

28:16.339 --> 28:19.707
- It's locked.
- Do not be messing with me.

28:19.709 --> 28:22.243
- I'm not messing with you.
- Get out of the way.

28:33.622 --> 28:37.058
Oh, my God...
it's locked from the outside.

28:37.060 --> 28:39.060
What if Bulczynski locked us in?

28:39.062 --> 28:41.062
Let me try again. Probably just got stuck.

28:41.064 --> 28:44.165
Shoot! There must be
a release here somewhere.

28:44.167 --> 28:45.967
Okay, stop. Stop!

28:45.969 --> 28:47.235
We shouldn't be trying to get out.

28:47.237 --> 28:50.405
We should be hunkering down.

28:50.407 --> 28:52.640
We should barricade the door.

28:54.410 --> 28:56.477
You don't think there were any
mutant viruses in those, do you?

28:56.479 --> 28:59.113
No, I don't. Even, Evan, would you stop?

28:59.115 --> 29:00.615
Stop freaking out!

29:00.617 --> 29:03.918
Listen to me, there is a sick
mad scientist out there

29:03.920 --> 29:06.854
who spent a lifetime creating
Anthrax, weaponizing ticks,

29:06.856 --> 29:08.523
- maddening cows...
- He said that?

29:08.525 --> 29:09.958
Yeah, he admitted he went all of the world

29:09.960 --> 29:11.726
looking for germs. Just imagine what kind

29:11.728 --> 29:13.728
of crazy stuff he found in New Guinea

29:13.730 --> 29:14.996
and wherever the hell else he went.

29:14.998 --> 29:16.431
I'm sorry, he was in Papua, New Guinea?

29:16.433 --> 29:18.466
Did he... did he mention the Fore tribe?

29:18.468 --> 29:20.468
Yes, he did. Why?

29:20.470 --> 29:21.736
- Um...
- Why?

29:21.738 --> 29:23.605
- Ah. Yeah.
- Henry, wha...

29:23.607 --> 29:26.207
God, I hate when you do this. Why?

29:26.209 --> 29:28.276
It would explain his odd laughter.

29:28.278 --> 29:31.846
But the last victim died in, like, 2005.

29:31.848 --> 29:35.550
Last victim? What do you...
victim of what?

29:35.552 --> 29:40.488
Yeah, "kuru can have up to
a 30-year incubation."

29:40.490 --> 29:43.858
"Kuru... otherwise known
as the laughing death"?

29:43.860 --> 29:46.094
Yeah, yeah. The symptoms do line up.

29:46.096 --> 29:48.930
"Loss of coordination,
confusion, mood swings."

29:48.932 --> 29:50.898
Hold on, shut up. This...

29:50.900 --> 29:53.501
it says you get it
from eating human brains.

29:53.503 --> 29:56.104
That's not... that's not real, right?

29:56.106 --> 29:58.406
It's very real, Evan.

29:58.408 --> 30:02.610
He's a real live zombie. I knew it.

30:02.612 --> 30:04.512
Those aren't even cauliflow...
I <i>knew</i> it! I knew...

30:04.514 --> 30:06.347
Calm down, calm down. Listen to me.

30:06.349 --> 30:09.017
It doesn't mean he wants to eat us, right?

30:09.019 --> 30:13.421
I... I mean, just because
he's dabbled in... cannibalism.

30:13.423 --> 30:14.656
Oh, he dabbled in cannibal...

30:14.658 --> 30:16.257
how do you <i>dabble</i> in cannibalism, Henry?

30:16.259 --> 30:17.859
Use a taster spoon?

30:17.861 --> 30:19.093
Come on, Henry.
[Wheezes sharply]

30:19.095 --> 30:21.095
Evan... it's happening to me.

30:21.097 --> 30:22.797
What's hap... hey, don't mess with me now.

30:22.799 --> 30:24.365
- This is not funny.
- I can't...

30:24.367 --> 30:25.867
- You swear?
- I... I swear.

30:25.869 --> 30:28.069
Henry. Oh, my God, Henry.
Tell me what to do.

30:28.071 --> 30:31.472
[Gasping]
I don't... know.

30:31.474 --> 30:37.011
[Hank groaning]
Oh, my God. Okay, um, um...

30:37.013 --> 30:40.281
Kuru... kuru was in the tubes.

30:40.283 --> 30:41.683
[Voice muffled]
Okay, hang in there, Henry.

30:41.685 --> 30:43.017
Just breathe. Or don't breathe.

30:43.019 --> 30:45.853
Whichever's better. Just... okay, uh, uh...

30:45.855 --> 30:49.557
It's the kuru! Ku...
hold on, Henry, just hold on!

30:49.559 --> 30:51.659
[Slapping windows]
Someone help me!

30:51.661 --> 30:53.428
It's my brother! Please help me!

30:53.430 --> 30:55.129
It's the kuru!

30:55.131 --> 30:57.532
- Brains...
- Henry.

30:57.534 --> 30:59.767
- Must have...
- Henry.

30:59.769 --> 31:02.036
- Brains...
- No, it's me, it's Evan!

31:02.038 --> 31:06.107
Henry, no, no, no! I'm your brother!

31:06.109 --> 31:08.276
[Cheerful normal voice]
Oh, my God.

31:08.278 --> 31:09.577
- You're... you're dead.
- Oh, yeah?

31:09.579 --> 31:12.714
- What are you gonna do?
- Henry, that was not funny.

31:12.716 --> 31:14.082
What are you gonna do? Ow!

31:14.084 --> 31:15.450
How could you fall for that?

31:15.452 --> 31:17.351
You almost gave me
a heart attack... come here.

31:17.353 --> 31:19.921
You are so dead.

31:19.923 --> 31:22.757
- Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!
- Take it. Take it!

31:22.759 --> 31:25.293
Who's in there?

31:25.295 --> 31:29.230
Uh, just the dog... and Hankmed...

31:29.232 --> 31:32.266
Ish.

31:32.268 --> 31:33.601
Ish.

31:37.546 --> 31:39.948
We need to get that lock fixed.

31:39.950 --> 31:42.083
- Oh, no, we were fine.
- Yeah.

31:42.085 --> 31:43.918
Didn't have clearance.

31:43.920 --> 31:47.088
Dr. Sacani said that his CT was clear,

31:47.090 --> 31:48.490
but on our walk,

31:48.492 --> 31:50.925
he confused a saprophyte with a parasite.

31:50.927 --> 31:53.995
- I thought maybe some lunch...
- That's a great idea.

31:53.997 --> 31:55.563
Evan, see if Dr. Sacani got back

31:55.565 --> 31:57.699
- any blood results.
- There's no signal out here.

31:57.701 --> 31:59.868
Oh, yeah, you can use
the phone right inside.

31:59.870 --> 32:01.903
Done and done.

32:01.905 --> 32:03.872
Dr. Bulczynski, my brother mentioned

32:03.874 --> 32:06.040
you did some work with the Fore tribe.

32:06.042 --> 32:08.843
Oh, sweet people.
[Laughs]

32:08.845 --> 32:12.080
Uh... who are we talking about?

32:12.082 --> 32:14.716
Do you know today's date?

32:14.718 --> 32:17.285
Hmm.
[Muttering]

32:17.287 --> 32:19.354
Grandpa, can you answer the doctor?

32:19.356 --> 32:20.955
Why did you feed that to the dog?

32:20.957 --> 32:25.226
Petri, the old guy
can swallow better than me.

32:25.228 --> 32:26.761
Is it hard for you to swallow?

32:26.763 --> 32:28.730
Oh, yeah. Ooh...

32:28.732 --> 32:31.199
Do you feed all your meals to Petri?

32:31.201 --> 32:32.734
Only the meat.

32:32.736 --> 32:35.603
Grandpa, why didn't you tell me?

32:35.605 --> 32:38.106
So Dr. Sacani got the test results back.

32:38.108 --> 32:40.441
- He has a diagnosis.
- Let me guess.

32:40.443 --> 32:41.943
Dr. Bulczynski's symptoms are due to

32:41.945 --> 32:43.645
a vitamin B12 deficiency.

32:43.647 --> 32:48.716
No. He said it's
"hypo... ca... cabela... cobela..."

32:48.718 --> 32:51.452
Hypocobalaminemia?

32:51.454 --> 32:54.455
- That's right.
- That's a B12 deficiency.

32:54.457 --> 32:57.392
- He's going to be okay.
- Really?

32:59.128 --> 33:01.796
Thank you so much for helping me

33:01.798 --> 33:03.264
convince him to come in.

33:03.266 --> 33:04.766
Well, until he's stable, it seemed best

33:04.768 --> 33:06.801
to start his B12 injections
here at the hospital.

33:06.803 --> 33:08.770
And an occupational therapist will help

33:08.772 --> 33:10.004
with his trouble swallowing.

33:10.006 --> 33:13.274
Um, what about his mental status?

33:13.276 --> 33:15.510
Oh, he should be
back to normal in no time.

33:15.512 --> 33:18.479
Oh, I'm so relieved.

33:18.481 --> 33:21.416
And he'll be so happy
to resume his research.

33:21.418 --> 33:23.818
Yeah, um, you know,
I didn't catch what, exactly,

33:23.820 --> 33:25.153
you two are researching.

33:25.155 --> 33:27.956
Mm, yeah, well, I'd tell you,

33:27.958 --> 33:29.691
but then I'd have to inoculate you.

33:29.693 --> 33:32.694
[Laughs]
Ah, right. Great.

33:32.696 --> 33:34.028
- Man...
- Hi, grandpa.

33:34.030 --> 33:35.430
What are the odds

33:35.432 --> 33:36.831
he'd have something that simple?

33:36.833 --> 33:38.132
Well, difficulty swallowing
is pretty common

33:38.134 --> 33:42.036
in older patients,
but it can also happen to...

33:42.038 --> 33:43.938
Come on, I need your help.

33:43.940 --> 33:45.506
For what? What are we doing?

33:45.508 --> 33:47.508
We're going to chase a zombie.

33:47.510 --> 33:50.011
Carrie...

33:50.013 --> 33:51.613
Jason's choking may not have been caused

33:51.615 --> 33:53.881
by fake blood, but by
a tightening in the muscle

33:53.883 --> 33:55.850
between his esophagus and stomach.

33:55.852 --> 33:57.619
It's called achalasia,

33:57.621 --> 33:58.853
which also can cause chest pain.

33:58.855 --> 33:59.988
Is it an emergency?

33:59.990 --> 34:01.456
If he's developing a blockage,

34:01.458 --> 34:03.057
he could choke again, yeah.
So can you call him?

34:03.059 --> 34:04.892
No cell phones on the course,

34:04.894 --> 34:06.461
but I should be able
to reach him on his walkie.

34:06.463 --> 34:08.329
Divya.

34:08.331 --> 34:11.132
Hey. I got your message.

34:11.134 --> 34:13.001
Why am I wearing running shoes?

34:13.003 --> 34:14.502
He's not answering.

34:14.504 --> 34:15.670
He could be anywhere out there.

34:15.672 --> 34:17.438
Okay, we need to fan out.

34:17.440 --> 34:19.407
Divya, we're looking for a guy
dressed as a zombie bridegroom.

34:19.409 --> 34:22.043
Come. Come on.

34:22.045 --> 34:24.512
[Zombies groaning, growling]

34:29.851 --> 34:32.253
Excuse me. Excuse me!

34:32.255 --> 34:34.656
I'm looking for a zombie.
He's dressed like a groom.

34:34.658 --> 34:36.891
- You see him?
- Yeah, that way.

34:36.893 --> 34:38.493
Okay. Thank you.

34:46.768 --> 34:47.768
Uh, excuse me.

34:47.771 --> 34:49.937
- Hey...
- Aah!

34:49.938 --> 34:51.938
Kim Kardashian zombie, excuse me.

34:51.940 --> 34:53.775
- No, no, I just want to...
- Get away!

34:53.777 --> 34:55.342
...ask you a question.

34:55.344 --> 34:57.078
Oh, my God. I just want to...

34:57.080 --> 34:59.847
oh, have any of you seen Jason?

34:59.849 --> 35:01.716
He runs the place.

35:01.718 --> 35:03.484
I'm not a contestant.

35:03.486 --> 35:05.053
No, no, I'm not... I'm... I'm just...

35:05.055 --> 35:07.689
I'm not a con... no, no, no...
[Zombie actors crying out]

35:07.691 --> 35:10.992
Okay... oh, my... holy crap!

35:10.994 --> 35:13.561
Okay, never mind, I'm fine.
I'll ask someone else.

35:13.563 --> 35:15.930
Leave me alone. I am not in this!

35:15.932 --> 35:18.900
I'm looking for someone.

35:18.902 --> 35:22.303
Don't you dare touch me!

35:22.305 --> 35:24.706
- Eddie!
- Yes.

35:24.708 --> 35:26.174
What are you doing here?

35:26.176 --> 35:28.710
Well, I'm just indulging
in some nostalgia.

35:28.712 --> 35:32.046
So... are my boys here?

35:32.048 --> 35:33.815
Unless someone's already eaten them.

35:33.817 --> 35:36.951
Well, let's go this way. Come on.

35:36.953 --> 35:40.488
[Tinny voice] Jason, come in.
Jason, answer me, please.

35:40.490 --> 35:44.392
Please, Jason, Jason, come in.
Answer me, please!

35:44.394 --> 35:48.496
- Jason, are you there?
- Uh, come to flag 13.

35:48.498 --> 35:51.065
Hey, Jason, are you okay?
[Wheezing, gasping]

35:51.067 --> 35:52.934
That's not fake blood, is it?

35:52.936 --> 35:54.736
All right, all right, just try to relax.

35:54.738 --> 35:57.004
Come here. I know it's hard to breathe.

35:57.006 --> 35:59.607
You have an obstruction
eroding your esophagus.

35:59.609 --> 36:03.144
- Henry!
- Evan, come here. Hurry up.

36:03.146 --> 36:05.012
All right, hold him.

36:05.014 --> 36:07.248
Hold him just like this
so I can scope his throat.

36:07.250 --> 36:09.617
All right, you're gonna be just fine.

36:09.619 --> 36:12.620
All right, here we go.

36:16.625 --> 36:21.262
Okay. Okay, Jason, I'm trying
to locate the blockage.

36:21.264 --> 36:23.865
Good. Okay, I see it.

36:23.867 --> 36:25.433
Yeah, I think we can get it out.

36:25.435 --> 36:27.101
I'm just gonna take that out.

36:27.103 --> 36:28.836
Okay.

36:28.838 --> 36:30.938
Good. You're good, dude.

36:36.378 --> 36:38.112
- Hold him steady, Ev.
- I got him.

36:38.114 --> 36:40.615
Okay. Yeah, there it is.

36:40.617 --> 36:41.749
[Coughing]

36:41.751 --> 36:43.384
- Okay, we got it.
- Oh, wow!

36:43.386 --> 36:45.553
Hey, there you go.

36:45.555 --> 36:47.822
- Is he okay now?
- Yeah, we got the foreign body,

36:47.824 --> 36:48.956
so he can swallow and breathe,

36:48.958 --> 36:50.525
but, Jason, you're still bleeding.

36:50.527 --> 36:51.793
We need to get you to the hospital

36:51.795 --> 36:53.161
to rule out an esophageal tear.

36:53.163 --> 36:55.129
Jason, oh, my God.

36:55.131 --> 36:57.899
I'm okay.

36:57.901 --> 37:00.468
[Coughing]

37:00.470 --> 37:02.136
The EMTs are on their way.

37:02.138 --> 37:04.472
- Good. Nice work.
- You too.

37:04.474 --> 37:09.210
Well, it looks like Hankmed
is back from the dead.

37:11.380 --> 37:13.915
Okay, let's get him up.

37:13.917 --> 37:18.352
Well, it wasn't exactly like
the old days in Passaic,

37:18.354 --> 37:21.055
but I'm so happy you both came.

37:21.057 --> 37:24.225
Ah, thanks, but I'm on call.

37:24.227 --> 37:26.627
Um, speaking of the old days,

37:26.629 --> 37:28.663
here's to dad's book.

37:28.665 --> 37:31.232
- Yeah.
- That part about me and Hank,

37:31.234 --> 37:32.834
that really brought back some memories.

37:32.836 --> 37:34.068
It did?

37:34.070 --> 37:36.404
You remember me being
all wild and crazy too?

37:36.406 --> 37:38.673
- Hank was crazy?
- Wait, are you kidding?

37:38.675 --> 37:40.441
- You were the craziest.
- What?

37:40.443 --> 37:42.844
You were my wild child.

37:42.846 --> 37:44.512
I didn't know who
you were gonna kill first,

37:44.514 --> 37:46.514
yourself or your brother.

37:46.516 --> 37:48.850
Every time I intervened, it got worse.

37:48.852 --> 37:51.452
Their mom said,
"just give them some space."

37:51.454 --> 37:53.521
"They will probably work it out."

37:53.523 --> 37:54.856
I just don't remember being like that.

37:54.858 --> 37:56.724
Why would I block that out?

37:56.726 --> 38:00.027
Here. If you get a call,

38:00.029 --> 38:01.863
I'll have Jeremiah cover for you.

38:01.865 --> 38:03.464
- Really?
- Yes.

38:03.466 --> 38:05.266
It's one of the benefits
of having a practice

38:05.268 --> 38:08.870
where you're not the only doctor.

38:08.872 --> 38:11.472
Um... are you suggesting...

38:11.474 --> 38:14.609
Are you offering?

38:14.611 --> 38:16.577
Yes, he is, and, yes, you are. Okay.

38:16.579 --> 38:19.113
Let's make this official.

38:19.115 --> 38:20.948
We'll have to figure out the details.

38:20.950 --> 38:23.217
Later.

38:23.219 --> 38:26.320
To the return of the living Hankmed.

38:26.322 --> 38:28.456
[Laughs]

38:31.727 --> 38:33.427
Whoa. [Laughter]

38:51.917 --> 38:53.684
Boys.

39:04.830 --> 39:07.365
I think I realize why I blocked out

39:07.367 --> 39:08.899
my wild-child years.

39:08.901 --> 39:12.937
Yeah, they were the years
before mom got sick.

39:12.939 --> 39:15.840
Before dad left, and...

39:15.842 --> 39:17.675
yeah, before everything changed.

39:17.677 --> 39:19.110
[Chuckles]

39:19.112 --> 39:20.745
I was gonna chime in before, but...

39:20.747 --> 39:23.814
You didn't want to make dad feel bad.

39:23.816 --> 39:25.850
For what it's worth, I'm sure you were

39:25.852 --> 39:28.085
a much better wild child than I was.

39:28.087 --> 39:29.687
I mean, there was nothing you wouldn't try

39:29.689 --> 39:32.523
to get away with.

39:32.525 --> 39:34.992
But that's not who I am now, Henry.

39:34.994 --> 39:37.328
No, it's not.

39:37.330 --> 39:41.966
Ev, you brought us out here.
You envisioned this practice.

39:41.968 --> 39:45.569
Without you, Evan,
I wouldn't have this new life

39:45.571 --> 39:47.738
that I love so much.

39:47.740 --> 39:50.508
And I took way too long
to acknowledge all that.

39:50.510 --> 39:53.210
I'm sorry.

39:53.212 --> 39:54.912
I'm sorry I sold you short.

39:54.914 --> 39:56.714
I'm sorry I quit.

39:56.716 --> 39:58.549
I should have tried harder
to work it out with you,

39:58.551 --> 40:00.151
like we always do.

40:00.153 --> 40:02.753
Like we will do this time too.

40:02.755 --> 40:05.289
Because there is still plenty to work out.

40:05.291 --> 40:08.125
There is still plenty to work out.

40:08.127 --> 40:09.527
Is there an echo in here?

40:09.529 --> 40:11.262
'Cause I thought I just said that.

40:11.264 --> 40:12.530
I don't think you can have an echo

40:12.532 --> 40:14.565
in a big, flat, open space like this.

40:14.567 --> 40:16.267
Oh, now he's an accountant
and a physicist.

40:16.269 --> 40:17.268
Oh ho ho!

40:31.249 --> 40:33.617
Mom!

40:33.619 --> 40:35.286
What are you doing here?

40:35.288 --> 40:39.356
You were right. I had to take a chance.

40:39.358 --> 40:41.459
I've left your father.

40:45.297 --> 40:46.464
Ah...

40:48.633 --> 40:50.267
Oh, my goodness, perfect timing.

40:50.269 --> 40:52.336
The meat is still bloody,
just the way you like 'em.

40:52.338 --> 40:54.505
After today, I think
I'd rather have it medium.

40:54.507 --> 40:55.840
- All right.
- Hey.

40:55.842 --> 40:58.309
Hey.

40:58.311 --> 41:00.511
What's this website with
your picture on it, dad?

41:00.513 --> 41:02.646
That's my blog that you read.

41:02.648 --> 41:04.148
Oh, yeah. Did you...
you change the layout?

41:04.150 --> 41:06.584
- No.
- Look how many people read it.

41:06.586 --> 41:09.086
Whoa! Dad, that's quite a fan base.

41:09.088 --> 41:10.354
And counting.

41:10.356 --> 41:11.822
I told you the message would be embraced.

41:11.824 --> 41:14.191
It is.

People, not generally.

41:21.300 --> 41:23.100
Boris, not sure.

41:23.102 --> 41:26.403
I didn't hear a thing.

41:26.405 --> 41:27.872
It was probably nothing.

41:38.850 --> 41:40.384

41:42.288 --> 41:45.089

41:45.091 --> 41:47.258
An intruder has breached the perimeter.

41:47.260 --> 41:48.826
I'm sorry, but I'm afraid you're too late.

41:48.828 --> 41:50.761
- Let me take a look.
- I said you're too late.

41:50.763 --> 41:53.864
- Yeah, I heard you.
- Hank...

41:53.866 --> 41:55.499
