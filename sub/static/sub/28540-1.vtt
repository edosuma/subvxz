15:12.145 --> 15:14.479
I promise we'll have a proper
catch up later this week.

15:14.514 --> 15:15.947
Okay.
I miss you.

15:15.982 --> 15:18.116
I miss you, too.
Have fun tonight.

15:18.151 --> 15:19.350
Thank you.

15:22.188 --> 15:23.621
Bye.
Bye.

15:25.659 --> 15:26.925
(dog barking in distance)

15:27.027 --> 15:28.359
(doorbell ringing)

15:28.395 --> 15:30.662
Connor, honey?
Can you get that?

15:45.045 --> 15:49.647
You must be Connor.
I'm Jonathan Selby.

15:52.719 --> 15:55.353
My mom will be out in a second.

16:02.262 --> 16:04.162
Wow, it's a nice
place you got here.

16:04.197 --> 16:07.365
Hey, Connor, you into sports,

16:07.400 --> 16:10.635
I got season tickets
to the Falcons, club seats.

16:10.737 --> 16:13.204
I'm not really into sports.

16:13.239 --> 16:17.175
Well, football's certainly
not for everyone, is it?

16:17.210 --> 16:19.243
(footsteps approaching)

16:19.279 --> 16:20.411
(wolf whistling)

16:20.447 --> 16:23.181
Why, thank you.

16:23.216 --> 16:25.450
It's been a while since I've
gotten a wolf whistle.

16:25.552 --> 16:27.685
I find that hard to believe.

16:27.721 --> 16:30.588
Men around here
must have cataracts.

16:32.292 --> 16:35.493
Connor, this is Jonathan,

16:35.595 --> 16:37.161
the man I've been
telling you about.

16:37.263 --> 16:39.664
We met.

16:39.766 --> 16:43.267
Okay, well, we shouldn't
be out too late, sweetie.

16:43.303 --> 16:46.104
Okay.

16:46.139 --> 16:47.472
Everything okay?

16:47.574 --> 16:51.342
Sure.

16:51.444 --> 16:54.078
Jonathan:
Well, I look forward to
seeing you again, Connor.

17:11.031 --> 17:13.765
Who'd have thought all the fancy
places would be booked up?

17:13.867 --> 17:16.234
This is perfect, Jonathan.

17:18.071 --> 17:21.072
I'll let you in on another
little secret of mine.

17:21.107 --> 17:24.976
I'm a burger and fries
kind of gal at heart.

17:25.078 --> 17:28.813
You have no idea how
desirable you are, do you?

17:30.884 --> 17:32.950
I almost forgot.

17:33.053 --> 17:34.886
I have something to commemorate.

17:34.921 --> 17:36.988
To commemorate what?

17:37.090 --> 17:38.656
To commemorate the fact
that as of tonight

17:38.758 --> 17:41.559
we've been keeping
each other company for...

17:41.594 --> 17:44.128
Three hundred thirty six hours,

17:44.230 --> 17:46.564
forty two minutes,
and six seconds.

17:46.599 --> 17:47.632
Impressive.

17:47.734 --> 17:48.966
Was that too precise?

17:49.069 --> 17:51.602
(laughing)

17:57.944 --> 18:00.344
Jonathan...

18:08.755 --> 18:11.856
They're exquisite.

18:11.958 --> 18:15.093
They're hand crafted by
a woman I found at the market.

18:15.128 --> 18:16.994
They're one of a kind.

18:17.097 --> 18:20.064
Just like you.

18:29.609 --> 18:33.010
Since when is "zyquitic" a word?

18:33.113 --> 18:35.947
Are you doubting my veracity?

18:35.982 --> 18:40.084
Okay, professor, use it
in a sentence, I dare you.

18:40.120 --> 18:43.221
When you wear a certain
shade of blue, Nicole,

18:43.323 --> 18:45.089
your eyes are absolutely...

18:45.125 --> 18:49.560
Zyquitic.
Zyquitic.

18:49.662 --> 18:51.596
Hey, hon,
where you off to?

18:51.631 --> 18:53.798
I'm just going over to Matt's
to play some video games.

18:53.833 --> 18:56.100
Hey, Connor, hold up.

18:56.136 --> 18:58.169
Um, you ever hear of
a band called, Crushn'?

18:58.204 --> 18:59.937
Yeah, I have,

18:59.973 --> 19:02.673
and they're probably
my favourite local bands.

19:02.709 --> 19:03.908
And they're playing
at the campus,

19:04.010 --> 19:06.077
but tickets are
impossible to get.

19:06.179 --> 19:08.779
They're hard,
but not impossible.

19:08.815 --> 19:12.183
A student of mine is dating the
manager and she gave me a pair.

19:12.218 --> 19:14.619
I thought you and a
friend might want to go.

19:14.654 --> 19:15.953
Are you kidding?

19:15.989 --> 19:18.256
Wait till Matt hears about this.
He's gonna flip.

19:18.358 --> 19:22.160
Jonathan:
Hey, don't you want the tickets?

19:22.195 --> 19:24.929
Thank you so, so much.

19:38.044 --> 19:42.613
Jonathan:
You sure I can't help you clean?
You cooked.

19:42.715 --> 19:46.184
Have a seat and keep
me company, how's that?

19:46.219 --> 19:48.686
Actually, there is
something you could do.

19:48.721 --> 19:50.021
Name it.

19:50.056 --> 19:51.622
Would you mind taking
the trash out?

19:51.724 --> 19:55.593
Of course.

19:55.695 --> 19:57.728
What time did you say Connor is
gonna be done with his friends?

19:57.764 --> 20:01.232
Hmm. I don't expect him to be
back for a few hours at least.

20:01.267 --> 20:03.968
Oh, I think the trash can wait.

20:06.606 --> 20:20.318
<i> ♪</i>

21:16.843 --> 21:26.317
<i> ♪</i>

21:38.464 --> 21:41.065
I could get used to watching
you both do manual labour,

21:41.167 --> 21:44.068
but I'd worry
about how to repay you.

21:44.170 --> 21:46.771
Well, there is a favour I'd
like to ask of you in return.

21:46.806 --> 21:49.006
Oh yeah? What's that?

21:49.042 --> 21:51.342
Would you mind if I stored a few
boxes here for a couple weeks?

21:51.377 --> 21:53.711
Of course not, but why?

21:53.813 --> 21:56.914
Well, my dishwasher broke down,
flooded the kitchen.

21:57.016 --> 21:58.449
I gotta redo the whole
main floor of my condo.

21:58.484 --> 21:59.717
That sucks.

21:59.819 --> 22:01.285
Oh, yeah. It sucks big time.

22:01.321 --> 22:03.054
Flooded into my basement,

22:03.156 --> 22:04.388
so I just want to get some of
my more valuable belongings

22:04.490 --> 22:06.257
out of there before
they get destroyed.

22:06.359 --> 22:08.259
Absolutely.
But what about you?

22:08.361 --> 22:10.428
I'm worried about mould
and dust from all the work.

22:10.530 --> 22:12.096
Well, I just thought
I'd just check into a hotel

22:12.198 --> 22:13.297
while the work is being done.

22:13.333 --> 22:16.233
How long do they
think it will take?

22:16.336 --> 22:19.103
Uh, a couple weeks.

22:19.205 --> 22:23.741
Maybe a couple months, tops.

22:23.843 --> 22:25.910
Connor, what would you think

22:26.012 --> 22:27.478
if Jonathan moved in
with us for a while?

22:27.513 --> 22:30.781
Temporarily of course.

22:30.883 --> 22:32.883
Connor:
That'd be cool.

22:32.919 --> 22:35.052
Whoa, whoa, whoa. As much
as I appreciate the offer,

22:35.088 --> 22:37.455
I was not fishing
for an invitation.

22:37.557 --> 22:40.524
I know, but it makes sense,
doesn't it?

22:40.560 --> 22:43.127
Well, it'd just be
for a few weeks,

22:43.229 --> 22:44.895
and I insist on paying you.

22:44.931 --> 22:47.431
Even better.

22:47.533 --> 22:51.302
Looks like we have
a new roomie, kiddo.

23:03.383 --> 23:06.484
This is the last one.

23:06.586 --> 23:08.452
Hey, did you ever get a chance
to speak to Tom Braedan

23:08.554 --> 23:09.887
about that piece I wrote?

23:09.922 --> 23:11.756
I left a message for him,

23:11.791 --> 23:13.357
but he's out of the
country right now.

23:13.393 --> 23:15.359
No problem.

23:15.395 --> 23:18.229
What's this?

23:18.264 --> 23:22.233
"For superior knowledge of
American literature."

23:22.268 --> 23:24.001
Impressive.

23:24.103 --> 23:27.405
Yeah. Receiving that
award meant a lot to me.

23:38.251 --> 23:40.217
You at least going to tell
me what I did wrong

23:40.253 --> 23:42.853
or is it going to be
the silent treatment again?

23:42.955 --> 23:44.889
It should be fairly obvious to
an intelligent human being,

23:44.924 --> 23:46.457
but therein lies the problem.

23:46.492 --> 23:49.193
I was so proud of you when
you won your award tonight.

23:49.295 --> 23:51.395
Surprised you even saw me
receive the award, April,

23:51.431 --> 23:54.131
you seemed rather
preoccupied with my colleague.

23:54.167 --> 23:56.100
I didn't do anything wrong!

23:56.135 --> 23:57.601
The whole faculty is
probably wondering

23:57.637 --> 23:59.170
why someone with my credentials

23:59.272 --> 24:00.838
married a
dullard like yourself.

24:00.940 --> 24:02.940
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Great, great.

24:02.975 --> 24:04.275
That oughta calm your nerves.

24:04.310 --> 24:06.277
Drink up, April!

24:06.312 --> 24:10.481
I don't know how anybody would
be able to deal with this!

24:10.516 --> 24:11.982
You don't think
anyone else would love me?

24:12.018 --> 24:14.018
That's not what I'm saying.

24:14.120 --> 24:16.253
You don't think anyone
else could love me?!

24:16.289 --> 24:18.956
(sobbing)

24:28.634 --> 24:31.869
(phone ringing)

24:31.971 --> 24:34.338
(phone ringing)

24:37.009 --> 24:39.410
Speaking.

24:41.147 --> 24:43.447
Oh my God. When did this happen?

24:43.483 --> 24:46.317
Is she okay?

24:46.352 --> 24:49.153
Okay, okay.
I'll be right there. Okay?

24:57.330 --> 25:06.370
<i> ♪</i>

25:09.075 --> 25:11.041
Nicole:
You've got that down to a
science, haven't you?

25:11.077 --> 25:13.010
It takes a month
to make a habit

25:13.045 --> 25:14.211
and only a night to break it.

25:14.247 --> 25:16.013
You don't see
me complaining.

25:16.048 --> 25:17.615
You've got a great body.

25:17.717 --> 25:19.650
Oh, yeah?
You think so?

25:19.685 --> 25:21.151
Stop fishing.

25:21.187 --> 25:22.620
You know very well
you're in terrific shape

25:22.722 --> 25:23.621
for a man your age.

25:23.723 --> 25:26.156
For a man my age?

25:26.192 --> 25:30.694
You know what I mean.
You look great, period.

25:30.730 --> 25:33.364
(sighing)
That's better.

25:33.399 --> 25:36.066
What's that?

25:36.102 --> 25:40.170
Nothing much. Just an invite
to Chef To Table's annual gala.

25:40.206 --> 25:42.973
Gala. Sounds fancy.

25:43.075 --> 25:47.344
It is, which is why I usually
find an excuse not to go.

25:50.249 --> 25:53.183
I don't know, babe.

25:53.219 --> 25:55.386
Don't you think networking
at something like that

25:55.421 --> 25:57.288
would be good for you?

25:57.390 --> 25:59.957
I imagine there'd be some
pretty important people there.

26:00.059 --> 26:01.258
There usually are.

26:01.294 --> 26:04.094
Are you saying you'd
like to be my date?

26:04.130 --> 26:05.996
Could be a fun evening.

26:06.098 --> 26:07.731
Besides, it'd be a
good career move for you.

26:07.767 --> 26:11.001
I don't know about that,
but I'd love to show you off.

26:11.103 --> 26:14.271
I'll RSVP for the two of us.

26:27.420 --> 26:31.655
Connor, did you move the photo
of us that used to be here?

26:31.757 --> 26:34.725
Why would I do that?

26:34.760 --> 26:36.427
Never mind.

26:36.462 --> 26:39.263
Must have moved things around
when I was reorganizing.

26:39.298 --> 26:41.865
Well, memory's the first thing
to go when you get old, Mom.

26:45.137 --> 26:48.272
(phone ringing)

26:48.307 --> 26:49.740
Dad.

26:49.775 --> 26:51.542
Hey, bud. How's it going?

26:51.644 --> 26:52.676
<i> I'm good.</i>

26:52.778 --> 26:54.445
Mom told me about the trip.

26:54.480 --> 26:56.280
<i> Yeah. So, what do you think?</i>

26:56.315 --> 26:59.116
<i> Up for, uh, roughin' it</i>
<i> with your pops? Some fishing,</i>

26:59.151 --> 27:00.684
we'll get in some
white water rafting.

27:00.720 --> 27:02.620
Connor:
White water rafting?
No way!

27:02.655 --> 27:04.321
It's gonna be awesome.

27:04.357 --> 27:07.391
I miss you, buddy.
Listen, I got to head back in,

27:07.493 --> 27:09.360
but we'll talk soon, okay?

27:09.395 --> 27:11.829
Love you.

27:17.570 --> 27:19.803
Sounds like you and your dad

27:19.839 --> 27:22.506
are going to have a
a big ol' adventure.

27:24.510 --> 27:26.076
Betcha that's
a lot more exciting

27:26.178 --> 27:28.445
than the Crushn' concert.

27:28.547 --> 27:30.547
They're both cool.

27:30.583 --> 27:33.484
Yeah.
You'll have fun.

27:33.519 --> 27:36.854
Just like a couple
little Boy Scouts, huh?

27:49.402 --> 27:51.468
So, there I am, my first day
as a tenured professor,

27:51.570 --> 27:54.872
teaching a lecture hall
of 200 students.

27:54.907 --> 27:56.674
After about an hour of talking,

27:56.709 --> 28:00.077
I close the lesson by asking
them if anyone has any questions

28:00.112 --> 28:02.813
about 18th Century
American Literature.

28:02.915 --> 28:04.248
Jim: And did they?

28:04.283 --> 28:05.783
I'll never know.

28:05.885 --> 28:07.851
Apparently,
I was giving a lecture

28:07.887 --> 28:10.754
to 200 Polish
exchange students.

28:10.790 --> 28:13.724
I walked into
the wrong classroom

28:13.759 --> 28:15.626
and no one had
the heart to correct me.

28:15.728 --> 28:17.828
Oh no! Don't tell me they didn't
understand anything you'd said!

28:17.930 --> 28:19.463
Not a word.

28:19.565 --> 28:22.266
They were the most attentive
students I've ever had.

28:22.301 --> 28:25.402
It sounds like you had
a lot of good times back in...

28:25.438 --> 28:27.638
I'm sorry, I can't remember
where you moved from.

28:27.740 --> 28:29.440
Madison.

28:29.475 --> 28:31.341
Carrie:
Right. Sounds
like you really enjoyed

28:31.444 --> 28:33.544
teaching American
literature there.

28:33.579 --> 28:37.181
Jonathan:
I enjoy sharing my love of
literature with young minds.

28:37.283 --> 28:39.650
If I'm not mistaken,

28:39.752 --> 28:43.487
Jonathan here did his doctoral
dissertation on Edgar Allan Poe.

28:43.589 --> 28:45.756
Jonathan:
I've always identified
with Poe when he said,

28:45.791 --> 28:48.292
"Deep into that
darkness peering,

28:48.327 --> 28:52.429
"long I stood there, wondering,
fearing, doubting,

28:52.465 --> 28:56.333
"dreaming dreams that no mortal
ever dared to dream before."

28:56.435 --> 29:00.270
Sounds like he had a pretty
high opinion of himself.

29:00.306 --> 29:02.506
Carrie:
As I said... creepy.

29:02.608 --> 29:04.508
Yeah, maybe he did think
a lot of himself, Nicole,

29:04.610 --> 29:07.411
but that's what allowed him
imagine the stories he did.

29:07.446 --> 29:10.681
Or maybe it was because
he had a real ability

29:10.783 --> 29:12.382
to creep people out
like you, Carrie.

29:12.485 --> 29:13.717
Jim:
Well, that wouldn't be
too difficult.

29:13.819 --> 29:15.519
My wife is a wuss.

29:15.621 --> 29:17.254
Carrie:
I am not!

29:17.289 --> 29:19.757
Jim: You are.

29:35.040 --> 29:36.540
Tonight was nice, wasn't it?

29:36.642 --> 29:37.975
Yeah.
They're good people.

29:38.010 --> 29:41.145
We'll do it again soon.

29:41.180 --> 29:42.713
I was a little surprised

29:42.815 --> 29:45.115
when you mentioned
you were from Madison.

29:45.151 --> 29:48.452
I was under the impression that
you'd moved here from Redan.

29:48.487 --> 29:51.421
I didn't know I was
going to be interrogated.

29:51.524 --> 29:53.423
Of course not, I was just--

29:53.526 --> 29:54.858
Look, I was raised in Redan,

29:54.894 --> 29:58.395
and I moved to
Madison to teach,

29:58.497 --> 30:00.898
so that April could be
closer to her family.

30:01.000 --> 30:03.000
Satisfied?

30:03.035 --> 30:05.936
I was just curious.

30:06.038 --> 30:08.972
Just had a lot of
painful memories.

30:09.008 --> 30:11.942
I'd just rather
not talk about them.

30:12.044 --> 30:14.678
I understand that.

30:16.682 --> 30:19.216
(razor buzzing)

30:22.555 --> 30:24.188
Here, let me help.

30:33.532 --> 30:35.666
Ooh. I love the
little sprinkle of grey.

30:35.701 --> 30:39.670
What grey?

30:39.705 --> 30:41.839
It was a compliment.

30:41.874 --> 30:43.640
It makes you look distinguished.

30:43.742 --> 30:47.845
When I need your commentary,
I'll ask for it.

30:49.615 --> 30:52.082
I'm going to turn in.

30:59.892 --> 31:04.194
Don't other people live here?

31:04.230 --> 31:05.863
Huh?

31:05.898 --> 31:07.931
Maybe the rest of us
would enjoy a glass of juice

31:07.967 --> 31:10.934
every now and then, without your
bacteria floating around in it.

31:10.970 --> 31:13.904
It's a pretty
disgusting habit.

31:16.775 --> 31:18.508
Everything okay in here?

31:18.611 --> 31:20.978
Everything is great.

31:21.080 --> 31:22.813
I'm just giving
some life lessons

31:22.915 --> 31:27.284
that obviously slipped
through the cracks.

31:32.958 --> 31:34.758
About last night...

31:37.096 --> 31:40.163
Your dinner was amazing.
You outdid yourself.

31:40.266 --> 31:43.934
And look at that,
it is late.

31:43.969 --> 31:46.603
I better get a move on.

31:49.975 --> 31:52.042
I'll see you later, babe.

32:04.957 --> 32:07.624
Should I save you the batter?

32:11.196 --> 32:14.798
Mom, why do you let him
talk to you like that?

32:14.833 --> 32:17.601
You know, like you
were some kind of kid.

32:17.636 --> 32:20.971
He doesn't do that.

32:21.006 --> 32:23.640
Dad would never
talk to you like that.

32:23.676 --> 32:25.609
Is this about your dad?

32:25.644 --> 32:28.111
Forget I said anything.

32:28.147 --> 32:30.280
I thought you liked Jonathan.

32:30.316 --> 32:32.983
I do. But...

32:36.989 --> 32:40.657
He blows hot and cold,
you know what I mean?

32:43.662 --> 32:46.029
I know he has his faults,
but he's been through a lot.

32:46.065 --> 32:48.298
He lost his wife last year.

32:49.902 --> 32:51.969
I didn't know that.

32:52.004 --> 32:56.940
Sweetie, your feelings matter
to me more than anything else.

32:57.042 --> 32:59.576
I hope you know that.

32:59.678 --> 33:02.112
Whatever you say.

33:03.849 --> 33:08.618
The other night Jonathan
kind of snapped at me.

33:08.721 --> 33:10.253
Was it bad?

33:10.356 --> 33:12.289
Not terrible, but...

33:12.391 --> 33:14.224
Jim and I usually have
a pretty good blow up

33:14.259 --> 33:15.959
every two months or so.

33:16.061 --> 33:17.361
This was over
something so stupid.

33:17.396 --> 33:19.129
It always is.

33:19.231 --> 33:21.898
The next day, he acted
like it never happened.

33:21.934 --> 33:23.300
That's a shame.

33:23.402 --> 33:25.202
Guys never like to
admit they're wrong.

33:25.237 --> 33:28.171
Did you tell him
how you felt?

33:28.207 --> 33:30.140
He didn't want to
talk about it again.

33:30.242 --> 33:33.710
Hmm. Look, Jonathan's
a good guy, right?

33:33.746 --> 33:35.278
Right.

33:35.381 --> 33:38.615
So, don't let a little
argument spoil things for you.

33:38.717 --> 33:40.784
I'm just worried we
rushed the relationship

33:40.886 --> 33:42.853
with this temporary move in.

33:42.888 --> 33:45.355
You'll work through it.

33:49.395 --> 33:53.330
Not as good as
the first place we went.

33:55.067 --> 33:57.267
Maybe we should get
back on a health kick.

33:57.302 --> 33:59.102
We could use more veggies.

33:59.138 --> 34:01.605
I'm all for healthy eating,
but every now and then,

34:01.640 --> 34:05.142
I get a craving that only
grilled meat will satiate.

34:05.244 --> 34:08.812
Hey.
Uh, Lauren finished her shift,

34:08.914 --> 34:10.680
so I'll be taking over.

34:10.783 --> 34:12.015
Thank you.

34:12.117 --> 34:13.250
How's your meal, Professor?

34:13.285 --> 34:17.954
It's delicious.
Thank you.

34:17.990 --> 34:21.258
Mm. She's one of my students.

34:21.293 --> 34:23.427
Ashley, is it?

34:23.462 --> 34:26.063
No, it's Amber.

34:26.098 --> 34:28.632
Hi, Amber.

34:28.667 --> 34:31.201
Ms. Weston writes
for a gourmet magazine.

34:31.303 --> 34:33.336
That's cool.

34:33.439 --> 34:35.639
She was just saying that burgers

34:35.674 --> 34:37.174
are not a part of
normal diet.

34:37.276 --> 34:39.676
I'm afraid her taste
is a little more refined

34:39.778 --> 34:40.844
than yours and mine.

34:40.946 --> 34:43.747
That's not what I meant. I--

34:43.782 --> 34:45.449
Yeah, well, these burgers
are pretty amazing.

34:45.484 --> 34:47.684
I mean, they're so juicy

34:47.786 --> 34:50.387
and, uh, succulent.

34:53.125 --> 34:57.160
Okay, well, let me know
if you need anything else.

34:59.798 --> 35:02.299
Oh my God.
Does that happen often?

35:02.334 --> 35:04.367
Does what happen often?

35:04.470 --> 35:07.237
Come on, Jonathan. That girl
was totally crushing on you.

35:07.339 --> 35:09.106
Don't tell me you're jealous.

35:09.141 --> 35:12.042
Oh, please. You know, I think
you kind of got off on it.

35:12.144 --> 35:16.279
Oh, can I help it if
I'm irresistible?

35:22.221 --> 35:26.022
(bell ringing)

35:26.058 --> 35:28.058
Miss Gordon,

35:28.160 --> 35:29.826
can I have a word with you?

35:32.331 --> 35:35.899
Was there a problem
with the paper I turned in?

35:36.001 --> 35:38.068
On the contrary.
I've been meaning to tell you

35:38.170 --> 35:39.836
that your handling
of the portrayal

35:39.872 --> 35:41.204
of women in early
American literature

35:41.240 --> 35:42.472
was on the mark.

35:42.508 --> 35:43.874
You liked it?

35:43.909 --> 35:45.709
It's brilliant.

35:45.744 --> 35:48.078
I think you should consider
getting it published somewhere.

35:48.180 --> 35:50.514
Of course, it would
need some editing, though.

35:50.549 --> 35:52.849
Do you think
you could help?

35:52.885 --> 35:54.217
I mean when have the time.

35:54.253 --> 35:58.288
Shoot. I'm...
I'm going to miss my bus.

35:58.390 --> 35:59.322
I gotta go.

35:59.358 --> 36:00.457
Oh.

36:00.559 --> 36:03.193
Well, I'm sorry I delayed you.

36:03.228 --> 36:07.230
Tell you what, I'm-- I'm all
finished here for the day.

36:07.266 --> 36:09.432
The least I could do
is give you a lift home.

36:09.535 --> 36:11.301
Sure.

36:14.039 --> 36:16.540
After you.

36:18.577 --> 36:21.511
So, the points
I've made are minor.

36:21.547 --> 36:25.415
What's-- what's important
is the potential I see in you.

36:25.450 --> 36:27.384
I can't tell you

36:27.419 --> 36:29.319
what an honour that is,

36:29.421 --> 36:33.924
I mean, coming from
someone like you.

36:33.959 --> 36:38.128
I think of you as more
than just a student.

36:38.230 --> 36:41.131
After reading your words,

36:41.233 --> 36:43.433
I think of you as a peer
and as a kindred spirit.

36:53.979 --> 36:55.512
Nicole:
So, what'd you think?

36:55.614 --> 36:57.347
Too much of a chick
flick for you?

36:57.449 --> 36:59.082
Jonathan: It was okay.

36:59.117 --> 37:00.817
I almost didn't recognize
the lead actress, though.

37:00.919 --> 37:02.352
She's gotten so old.

37:02.454 --> 37:04.254
Well, at least she didn't
resort to bad plastic surgery

37:04.289 --> 37:05.822
like some actresses do.

37:05.924 --> 37:07.524
She probably should have.

37:07.626 --> 37:10.126
Seriously?

37:10.162 --> 37:13.463
Don't you think people should
be able to age gracefully?

37:13.498 --> 37:16.366
I think people should look
the very best they can.

37:16.468 --> 37:20.103
If you ask me,
she could use surgery.

37:23.275 --> 37:25.942
I'm going to get old,
too, you know?

37:28.447 --> 37:31.481
But you, my dear,
have that ethereal beauty.

37:31.516 --> 37:34.484
You're never going to
let yourself go.

37:37.522 --> 37:39.222
Popcorn?

37:44.863 --> 37:48.164
(chuckling)

37:48.200 --> 37:50.500
You're still not going to tell
me who Prince Charming is.

37:50.535 --> 37:52.135
Oh...

37:52.170 --> 37:54.838
Um...

37:54.873 --> 37:59.542
Okay, all you need to know
is that he's brilliant,

37:59.645 --> 38:04.447
and kind, and sexy,

38:04.483 --> 38:08.385
very generous.

38:08.487 --> 38:11.855
Oh, I can see that.
Did he give you those?

38:11.890 --> 38:13.990
Uh-huh.
Unique, right?

38:14.026 --> 38:16.359
He got them made
specially made for me

38:16.395 --> 38:18.561
because he says
that I'm unique.

38:18.664 --> 38:20.597
Oh please.

38:41.420 --> 38:44.521
Oh, damn it.
(sighing)

39:03.041 --> 39:04.941
Jonathan:
Do I have time to get
a short run in before dinner?

39:05.043 --> 39:06.476
What?

39:06.578 --> 39:08.311
Do I have time to get

Um, if you have a few minutes,

I was hoping I could speak
with you about your son.

Mrs. Holden:
Did you know him?

Not exactly.

Thank you.

When Carl was a graduate
student at Rossmore College,

43:02.480 --> 43:06.583
did he know a man by
the name of Jonathan Selby?

43:09.821 --> 43:14.824
He and Carl were roommates.
Best friends at one time.

43:14.926 --> 43:18.728
So, you liked him?

43:18.763 --> 43:22.031
At first, I did.

43:22.133 --> 43:23.499
What was not to like?

43:23.602 --> 43:25.268
He was polite, respectful,

43:25.303 --> 43:28.938
and flattered the
hell out of me.

43:28.974 --> 43:32.041
Of course, all that was before
we found out he was a thief.

43:32.143 --> 43:34.811
What do you mean?

43:34.846 --> 43:37.914
He and Carl were
both doctoral candidates.

43:37.949 --> 43:40.016
Selby liked to
call himself "professor"

43:40.118 --> 43:42.752
even before he earned the title.

43:42.787 --> 43:46.623
You said he was a thief.

43:46.658 --> 43:48.157
He hacked into Carl's computer,

43:48.193 --> 43:50.793
stole the essay,

43:50.829 --> 43:53.796
and deleted all the files.

43:56.534 --> 44:01.270
Um... did Carl
print a hard copy?

44:01.306 --> 44:04.107
Oh, he printed a
copy alright.

44:04.142 --> 44:06.943
Asked Selby
to proofread.

44:06.978 --> 44:09.579
Then when Carl
asked for it back,

44:09.681 --> 44:11.948
Selby claimed Carl
never gave it to him,

44:11.983 --> 44:14.651
must have only thought he did.

44:17.155 --> 44:19.555
That bastard stole
my son's paper,

44:19.658 --> 44:23.259
passed the work off
as his own.

44:24.696 --> 44:26.829
Did Carl ever go
to the administration

44:26.865 --> 44:28.998
to explain what happened?

44:29.034 --> 44:32.935
Of course he did,
but he had no proof.

44:33.038 --> 44:34.771
Wouldn't have made
much difference.

44:34.873 --> 44:37.040
Face it. That Jonathan could

44:37.075 --> 44:40.009
lie his way out of anything.

44:40.045 --> 44:44.881
Carl, they made out
to be the liar.

44:44.916 --> 44:49.752
Changed his life forever.

44:49.854 --> 44:53.856
It'll be 15 years in
September that he's gone.

44:55.026 --> 44:58.227
I'm so sorry for your loss.

45:17.782 --> 45:20.850
(phone ringing)

45:22.220 --> 45:23.886
(sighing) Hey, babe.

45:23.922 --> 45:25.188
Hi.

45:25.223 --> 45:27.156
Jonathan:
<i> Where you been?</i>

45:27.258 --> 45:28.758
Just running errands.

45:28.793 --> 45:32.061
Um, I had a bit of
research to do, too.

45:32.097 --> 45:35.998
Well, come home, because I'm
making a romantic dinner for us.

45:36.101 --> 45:37.767
<i> It's, uh, pretty impressive,</i>

45:37.802 --> 45:39.302
<i> don't you think?</i>

45:39.404 --> 45:41.070
Where's Connor?

45:41.106 --> 45:44.240
He's still at school.

him of plagiarism,

that he'd go to the
dean and tell him

50:46.778 --> 50:48.644

the girl discuss

1:13:56.566 --> 1:14:00.668

1:14:00.703 --> 1:14:01.903

1:14:01.938 --> 1:14:04.105
Well, her roommate, Ms. Yamato,

1:14:04.207 --> 1:14:06.574
she said she recently
started dating a new guy,

1:14:06.609 --> 1:14:09.377
and she didn't know who he was.

1:14:09.412 --> 1:14:11.679

heard something in class

1:14:11.714 --> 1:14:14.348
