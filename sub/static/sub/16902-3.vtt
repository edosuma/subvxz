WEBVTT

00:04.537 --> 00:05.697
Miss Lemon.

00:06.840 --> 00:08.637
It's me, Kenneth Parcell, the page.

00:09.709 --> 00:11.678
You probably didn't recognize me
in this new page uniform.

00:11.678 --> 00:12.679
I recognize you, Kenneth.

00:12.679 --> 00:16.282
The old uniforms were timeless, practical, sexy.

00:16.282 --> 00:17.751
But this?

00:17.751 --> 00:19.352
This is an outrage.

00:19.352 --> 00:21.217
You need to make them
go back to the old uniform.

00:21.287 --> 00:22.515
Well, I don't have that kind of authority.

00:22.589 --> 00:23.715
Then what do you do?!

00:26.926 --> 00:27.927
Hey!

00:27.927 --> 00:29.451
I just got a call from security.

00:29.829 --> 00:32.821
That's ridiculous. Why would I
steal a file from personnel?

00:32.999 --> 00:34.401
What?

00:34.401 --> 00:35.959
No, Claire is in the lobby.

00:36.136 --> 00:37.967
Claire Harper? From Chicago?

00:38.071 --> 00:39.902
Yup. Fun, crazy Claire.

00:40.040 --> 00:43.543
Oh, man! Do you remember that night
we all danced in the open fire hydrant?

00:43.543 --> 00:44.644
Yeah! Her roof parties?

00:44.644 --> 00:45.975
Karaoke in Boystown?

00:46.046 --> 00:47.638
The all-night scavenger hunts?

00:47.781 --> 00:49.646
Do you remember when we
crashed that Polish wedding?

00:50.950 --> 00:52.042
Yeah, she's exhausting.

00:52.185 --> 00:54.983
Ugh, I know. She's gonna make us
buy more of her homemade jewelry.

00:55.055 --> 00:56.647
Birds always attack me when I wear it.

00:57.290 --> 00:59.793
I am not letting her drag me
out to some club tonight.

00:59.793 --> 01:01.090
I am too old for that.

01:01.394 --> 01:02.395
Up or down, ladies?

01:02.395 --> 01:04.385
Neither, we're waiting
for our old roommate.

01:04.563 --> 01:05.999
She's like a human "Macarena":

01:05.999 --> 01:08.568
something everyone did at parties in 1996.

01:08.568 --> 01:09.636
Mee-ow.

01:09.636 --> 01:10.703
You're right, that was harsh.

01:10.703 --> 01:11.704
No, "Mi Au."

01:11.704 --> 01:14.307
She owns the largest alternative
energy company in Asia.

01:14.307 --> 01:16.176
So as part of our Green Initiative,

01:16.176 --> 01:18.678
we're doing a reality show
about her quest for a boyfriend.

01:18.678 --> 01:19.702
Wow.

01:20.580 --> 01:22.810
Here comes Claire.
I'm already tired.

01:24.000 --> 01:30.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:31.925 --> 01:32.992
Surprise! I'm designing hats now!

01:32.992 --> 01:33.959
Oh, hats!

01:34.594 --> 01:36.186
Oh, Claire, this is my boss, Jack Donaghy.

01:36.729 --> 01:37.696
Hi, there.

01:37.764 --> 01:39.356
Welcome to New York, let's see...

01:39.432 --> 01:41.167
We're using credit cards in cabs now.

01:41.167 --> 01:43.036
All the galleries have moved to Chelsea.

01:43.036 --> 01:44.697
And we're off cupcakes and back to donuts.

01:44.771 --> 01:46.204
Would you excuse me
for a moment, please?

01:48.041 --> 01:49.770
So girls, what are we doing tonight?

01:49.976 --> 01:52.445
You know, the baggage handler
told me about this storage unit party

01:52.445 --> 01:53.713
that's on the Lower East Side.

01:53.713 --> 01:54.714
Starts about midnight.

01:54.714 --> 01:57.706
It's sponsored by Myirt Vodka
and some drug dealer.

01:58.017 --> 02:00.487
But the only rule is that we all have to DJ!

02:00.487 --> 02:02.546
I mean, it's gonna be so much fun!

02:32.418 --> 02:34.318
What's wrong, Ken?
You've got "wife eyes".

02:34.654 --> 02:35.951
I'm just sad, sir.

02:36.356 --> 02:39.359
I've worn this old jacket
since nineteen --

02:39.359 --> 02:40.827
And now they're just throwing it away.

02:40.827 --> 02:42.556
Is there nothing sacred?

02:42.729 --> 02:44.560
Have we lost our moral center?

02:44.797 --> 02:46.458
It just makes me want to pee on someone.

02:46.599 --> 02:48.567
And I appreciate that, sir.

02:48.701 --> 02:50.669
But rules are rules.
I'm just gonna have to live with it.

02:50.937 --> 02:52.705
I hate to see you like this, Ken Doll.

02:52.705 --> 02:55.435
It's like an owl without a graduation cap.

02:55.508 --> 02:56.566
Heartbreaking!

02:57.210 --> 02:58.611
So what can I buy you to make you happy?

02:58.611 --> 03:01.603
The things I want don't have a price tag, sir.

03:01.814 --> 03:05.545
Money can't buy a sunset.
Or a child's smile.

03:05.618 --> 03:09.956
Or a satisfying finale
to the hit NBC series "Night Court".

03:09.956 --> 03:12.058
Court? At night?

03:12.058 --> 03:14.549
I'm already laughing!
Tell me more.

03:15.028 --> 03:17.931
Well, "Night Court" was supposed
to end with a wedding

03:17.931 --> 03:19.728
between Christine and Harry.

03:19.933 --> 03:21.568
But the show didn't get a 10th season

03:21.568 --> 03:23.866
so that great love story was left untold.

03:24.070 --> 03:26.766
So you never got closure
with those beloved characters?

03:30.977 --> 03:34.276
Did you see our shout-out in Variety?
They called us a comedy show!

03:34.614 --> 03:36.883
Lemon, I ran into your friend
Claire in the elevator.

03:36.883 --> 03:38.976
She is very pretty.

03:39.085 --> 03:41.553
No, no, no. She is nuts
when it comes to guys.

03:41.721 --> 03:43.656
We had a name for her in Chicago...

03:43.656 --> 03:44.657
It's...

03:44.657 --> 03:46.352
too rude to say out loud.

03:50.063 --> 03:51.030
"Crazyputty"?

03:51.497 --> 03:52.464
No.

03:52.832 --> 03:55.301
She's psycho.
She is Fatal Attraction.

03:55.301 --> 03:58.327
She is staunchly in favor of Cocoa Puffs.

03:58.438 --> 03:59.735
Do not sleep with her.

03:59.872 --> 04:01.737
I wish you had told me that an hour ago.

04:01.874 --> 04:02.841
What?

04:03.876 --> 04:05.275
Oh, hey, Liz.

04:05.545 --> 04:06.569
Jack was just...

04:06.846 --> 04:09.406
giving me directions to the F train.

04:10.416 --> 04:12.252
So are we still on for tonight?

04:12.252 --> 04:14.186
Because it is going to be epic.

04:14.554 --> 04:15.714
I can't, I...

04:15.989 --> 04:17.957
volunteer at a thing with...

04:18.190 --> 04:19.624
kids and old people.

04:20.159 --> 04:21.160
Bring 'em!

04:21.160 --> 04:22.559
See ya!

04:24.664 --> 04:28.031
What were you thinking? Some woman you've
known for 10 seconds in the elevator?

04:28.201 --> 04:31.398
I don't see what the problem is.
This is objectively awesome.

04:31.471 --> 04:34.841
You don't understand. For her,
sex isn't something you have to do

04:34.841 --> 04:36.240
after the 1 2th date.

04:36.576 --> 04:39.602
She uses it to suck men in
and bleed them dry.

04:39.712 --> 04:42.943
Back in Chicago, I saw her take
powerful men down.

04:43.182 --> 04:46.719
Didn't matter if it was Scottie Pippen,
or the drummer for the BoDeans

04:46.719 --> 04:50.857
...or someone else's boyfriend who ran
a small but prestigious clowning academy.

04:50.857 --> 04:52.225
Whose boyfriend?

04:52.225 --> 04:55.717
Uh-huh, I get it. The fun, pretty girl
who got the guys, some of them yours.

04:55.862 --> 04:58.831
No, listen to me, she's not "fun."
She's just crazy.

04:58.965 --> 05:01.365
Like, grab a cop's gun crazy.

05:01.434 --> 05:04.737
Lemon, having known Claire for
a very enjoyable 20 minutes,

05:04.737 --> 05:08.195
and you for what feels like infinity,
I'm gonna go with Claire on this one.

05:12.078 --> 05:13.511
Ready for your big surprise?

05:13.746 --> 05:14.947
Yes, sir.

05:14.947 --> 05:16.883
Gosh, the last time I was blindfolded

05:16.883 --> 05:19.852
was when I had to play the piano
at that weird masquerade party.

05:21.287 --> 05:22.254
Ta-da!

05:23.589 --> 05:25.523
Some of the cast of Night Court!

05:25.625 --> 05:28.150
That's right, K.
And they're here for you.

05:28.294 --> 05:30.524
This is the sick kid
you were telling us about?

05:30.663 --> 05:33.393
Oh, bless your heart.
Do you like racecars?

05:33.566 --> 05:34.533
I do!

05:35.968 --> 05:39.734
Thank you, Mr. Jordan!
This is the greatest day of my life!

05:40.173 --> 05:41.941
First I find that quarter this morning --

05:41.941 --> 05:44.774
Uh, I lost a quarter. Earlier.

05:54.020 --> 05:56.284
Everyone-- To Mi Au.

05:56.356 --> 06:00.793
May tonight's fundraiser for your
Fundraising Foundation be as successful

06:00.893 --> 06:04.864
as last week's cocktail reception
for your rehab center.

06:06.399 --> 06:08.201
Jack's just being modest.

06:08.201 --> 06:09.725
He won't tell you...

06:10.636 --> 06:11.603
But I will!

06:12.305 --> 06:16.674
Today is Jack's birthday.

06:17.643 --> 06:18.610
Hit it, boys!

06:20.780 --> 06:23.416
# Happy Birthday...?

06:23.416 --> 06:25.611
# to you...?

06:26.018 --> 06:28.554
# Happy birthday...?

06:28.554 --> 06:30.351
# to you...?

06:31.090 --> 06:33.092
# Happy birth-?

06:33.092 --> 06:34.093
# -day...?

06:34.093 --> 06:35.094
# dear...?

06:35.094 --> 06:37.153
# Jackie Bear...?

06:37.830 --> 06:40.967
# Happy birthday...?

06:40.967 --> 06:44.470
# to him?

06:50.176 --> 06:54.772
Jack, introduce me to this
charming, young woman.

06:54.947 --> 06:57.541
I am his life coach,
Esmeralda Fitzmonster --

06:57.683 --> 06:59.548
Would you excuse us,
just for a moment please?

06:59.952 --> 07:01.120
How did you get in here?

07:01.120 --> 07:03.256
And first of all, it's not my birthday --

07:03.256 --> 07:04.245
I know. Isn't that funny?

07:05.124 --> 07:07.684
What? Oh, come on, are you mad?

07:08.094 --> 07:09.584
I'm just being fun and spontaneous.

07:09.729 --> 07:11.856
This is highly inappropriate.
I'm going to have to ask you to leave.

07:11.964 --> 07:14.524
Hey! If I kill myself it is all your fault!

07:25.545 --> 07:26.705
You were right about Claire.

07:27.447 --> 07:29.282
She crashed Mi Au's party.

07:29.282 --> 07:32.547
Uh-huh. Did she do "Sexy birthday"
or "Mannequin who comes to life"?

07:32.885 --> 07:34.580
"Sexy birthday", thank God!

07:35.121 --> 07:36.645
This is bad.
I need your help.

07:36.989 --> 07:39.025
When we were having sex at the
Palace, she said she loved me.

07:39.025 --> 07:39.992
You did it again?

07:40.059 --> 07:42.027
Well, it was quick and in the meat locker.
That's okay, right?

07:42.128 --> 07:45.928
What is it with you men? You're like junkies.
Why can't you just say no?

07:46.065 --> 07:48.634
Lemon, let me explain something
you could have no way of knowing.

07:48.634 --> 07:51.904
Emotionally unstable women are...

07:51.904 --> 07:55.575
fantastic in the sack.
I mean their self-loathing...

07:55.575 --> 07:57.566
translates into...

07:58.911 --> 08:00.003
Nevermind.

08:00.279 --> 08:03.082
I've got to get out of this.
What do other guys do?

08:03.082 --> 08:04.242
Well, one guy died.

08:04.317 --> 08:06.519
Scottie Pippen requested a trade to Houston.

08:06.519 --> 08:08.510
Houston's too humid.
What about this "died" thing?

08:08.588 --> 08:10.317
Ugh...
Where is she now?

08:10.423 --> 08:12.357
Chained to the radiator in her hotel room.

08:12.959 --> 08:15.223
It was her idea.
She's an amazing woman, Lemon.

08:15.394 --> 08:17.897
OK, I need to keep you two separated.

08:17.897 --> 08:19.232
I can't believe I'm gonna say this:

08:19.232 --> 08:21.723
I will go clubbing with Claire.

08:21.801 --> 08:23.302
I will attempt a hair-do.

08:23.302 --> 08:25.202
I will wear high heels.

08:25.304 --> 08:26.794
Claire's wearing high heels right now.

08:26.973 --> 08:29.408
Go home, junkie.
I'm cutting off your supply.

08:29.408 --> 08:32.535
She leaves Thursday. Do you think
you can make it through one night?

08:32.812 --> 08:35.280
I just gotta hack it...
I just gotta hack it...

08:36.749 --> 08:39.284
My boy Ken has written a masterpiece.

08:39.284 --> 08:41.809
And trust me, I use that word a lot.

08:42.121 --> 08:46.292
I just want to thank y'all
for making this dream come true for me.

08:46.292 --> 08:49.728
Finally giving America what it wants.

08:50.096 --> 08:54.066
A reunion of friends... from "Night Court".

08:54.066 --> 08:56.569
And the wedding of Harry and Christine!

08:56.569 --> 08:58.104
Before we begin...

08:58.104 --> 09:00.766
I would just like to say how special it is

09:00.840 --> 09:04.674
to be with you all again, my very special family.

09:04.844 --> 09:08.245
I just wish the brilliant
John Larroquette could be here as well.

09:08.314 --> 09:11.681
Yeah, he really did want to come,
but he couldn't work the schedule out.

09:12.084 --> 09:13.319
You and John still talk?

09:13.319 --> 09:14.513
We stay in touch, yeah.

09:14.987 --> 09:16.122
Did he mention me?

09:16.122 --> 09:17.557
You came up, Markie.

09:17.557 --> 09:19.191
You always come up, Markie!

09:19.191 --> 09:22.562
Well, of course I come up
at your little boys' club.

09:22.562 --> 09:26.020
You always thought you were better than me
because you got nominated for Emmys.

09:26.299 --> 09:30.258
Well, I would have too, but I was
too hot to be taken seriously!

09:30.403 --> 09:32.894
Well, that wouldn't be a problem now, would it?

09:37.610 --> 09:38.907
Mmm-hmmm.

09:39.545 --> 09:40.978
Court is adjourned.

09:44.750 --> 09:48.208
This is worse than the original finale!
What are we gonna do?

09:48.421 --> 09:50.912
I don't know, Ken.
This is bad.

09:50.990 --> 09:52.825
I wish this were an episode of Night Court

09:52.825 --> 09:55.055
'cause then there'd be
some big joke right now.

10:03.402 --> 10:05.165
Oh, that is so hot!

10:05.504 --> 10:06.766
You just look good in everything.

10:06.973 --> 10:09.208
I want to buy some hats.

10:09.208 --> 10:10.476
Yes!

10:10.476 --> 10:11.978
Hey! You're selling hats in the office!

10:11.978 --> 10:14.412
I am. And I didn't ask
because I knew you'd say yes.

10:15.114 --> 10:16.081
So...

10:16.215 --> 10:18.581
What's the haps?
What are we doing tonight?

10:18.784 --> 10:20.479
Hitting a clizz-ub with Jenna?

10:20.753 --> 10:23.551
You know I'd love to, but
I kinda have tentative plans.

10:23.723 --> 10:26.590
What, with Jack? Come on.
He's like the first guy you met here.

10:26.659 --> 10:30.563
Roll with us tonight and you will
meet someone even hotter.

10:30.563 --> 10:31.564
Really?

10:31.564 --> 10:35.134
Guaranteed. Like I was at this
club last week called...

10:35.134 --> 10:36.135
...Chili's

10:36.135 --> 10:39.400
And I met this smoking guy.

10:40.072 --> 10:41.562
He was just raw.

10:42.575 --> 10:44.543
Tell me everything.

10:44.644 --> 10:47.636
I'm going to.
He was wearing this shirt.

10:47.813 --> 10:49.872
And I could totally see his nips.

10:50.783 --> 10:52.218
And he was very muscular.

10:52.218 --> 10:53.285
Really!

10:53.285 --> 10:54.387
Did you go home with him?

10:54.387 --> 10:56.322
Yes. To his loft.

10:56.322 --> 10:58.415
Where he gave me the business.

10:59.392 --> 11:01.519
So let's go dancing in high heels!

11:01.994 --> 11:04.189
OK, I'm gonna do it.
I'm gonna blow off Jack.

11:04.263 --> 11:05.230
Where should we go?

11:05.998 --> 11:07.400
You guys should go to Aquarium.

11:07.400 --> 11:11.804
It's this new night club, and all the women
are in a glass room on the dance floor

11:11.804 --> 11:14.830
and all the guys just watch and feed them.

11:15.875 --> 11:17.342
That sounds so hot!

11:17.576 --> 11:19.203
Yes, thank you, Cerie.
That's very helpful.

11:19.311 --> 11:20.642
Thank you. So helpful.

11:21.914 --> 11:24.283
You have to go through with this wedding, Harry.

11:24.283 --> 11:25.978
It means the world to my boy Ken.

11:26.118 --> 11:28.254
Hey, I am game.
But it's Markie.

11:28.254 --> 11:29.653
She will not let go of the past.

11:29.922 --> 11:30.889
Okay.

11:31.057 --> 11:34.185
So you and Markeline have bad blood.
But it's bigger than that.

11:34.460 --> 11:37.020
My boy Kenneth is going through
some really tough times.

11:37.363 --> 11:38.898
They're trying to make him wear a coat

11:38.898 --> 11:40.798
that's different than his other coat.

11:45.805 --> 11:48.330
You won't regret this, Harry.
You look great.

11:51.610 --> 11:55.247
Markie, will you do me the honor
of becoming my fake wife

11:55.247 --> 11:57.579
so we can get our money
and get the hell out of here?

11:58.017 --> 12:01.043
I've waited 15 years
to hear you say those words.

12:01.120 --> 12:04.385
It's happening!
Nothing can go wrong now.

12:15.768 --> 12:16.826
There you are.

12:17.069 --> 12:18.204
Why'd you leave?

12:18.204 --> 12:20.604
I think those Persian guys wanted
us to make out together.

12:20.873 --> 12:23.676
I'm waiting for Claire.
She texted me like an hour ago

12:23.676 --> 12:26.008
and said that she was
getting on the F train --

12:27.580 --> 12:28.547
Oh, no.

12:29.582 --> 12:30.549
What? What is it?

12:36.222 --> 12:37.223
Lemon?

12:37.223 --> 12:38.986
Jack! She's in your house.

12:39.091 --> 12:42.128
Don't be ridiculous.

12:42.128 --> 12:43.390
The alarm is--

12:44.730 --> 12:47.722
I made you a white pizza and a pot roast

12:47.933 --> 12:51.027
because I just think you're so amazing...

12:51.804 --> 12:53.205
Look at me, playing house!

12:53.205 --> 12:56.368
My God, you must think
I'm out of my mind!

12:56.609 --> 12:57.610
Do you?

12:57.610 --> 12:59.669
You just looked away when
I said that! I saw you!

12:59.745 --> 13:00.712
No.

13:02.882 --> 13:05.578
Just kiss me. I know
your lips will be honest.

13:09.321 --> 13:10.288
Lemon, I gotta call you back.

13:14.426 --> 13:17.329
Now, when we left off, Christine
was stuck in the elevator,

13:17.329 --> 13:19.465
Mac had two dates on the same night,

13:19.465 --> 13:21.797
and Harry just discovered he was adopted.

13:21.867 --> 13:22.959
So let's turn to page two.

13:23.269 --> 13:26.033
Well, well, well
a Night Court reunion.

13:26.238 --> 13:30.109
Funny how I wasn't invited.
Or had you forgotten my three-episode arc

13:30.109 --> 13:31.736
as Public Defender
Sparky Monroe?

13:31.911 --> 13:35.403
No, we remember, Jenna.
You were the werewolf lawyer.

13:35.848 --> 13:41.684
I can prove my client is innocent.
If only it weren't a full "mooon"!

13:42.221 --> 13:43.789
You made us jump the shark!

13:43.789 --> 13:45.658
You're the reason we didn't have a 10th season.

13:45.658 --> 13:48.752
I had just bought my second home
when they brought that idiot werewolf lawyer in.

13:48.861 --> 13:52.160
Uh, that "idiot werewolf" paid for
my hand reduction surgery, Okay?

13:52.598 --> 13:54.667
Kenneth, I can't believe you're
such a Night Court fan

13:54.667 --> 13:56.328
and didn't know I played the werelawyer.

13:57.136 --> 13:58.103
I knew.

13:58.737 --> 13:59.965
Very well.

14:00.406 --> 14:01.373
I can take a hint.

14:03.309 --> 14:06.142
But you haven't seen the last
of Sparky Monroe!

14:11.884 --> 14:12.851
Liz, help me.

14:13.352 --> 14:14.979
Jack, what happened last night?

14:15.321 --> 14:16.555
Why are you wearing that hat?

14:16.555 --> 14:17.690
I don't know.

14:17.690 --> 14:19.225
You did it again?

14:19.225 --> 14:20.249
I can't help it.

14:20.693 --> 14:22.795
I'm under a lot of pressure,
and Claire is my escape.

14:22.795 --> 14:25.923
I crave her all the time
even though I know she's bad for me.

14:26.565 --> 14:27.998
And my teeth are getting loose!

14:28.400 --> 14:29.668
I don't think I can get out of this.

14:29.668 --> 14:30.657
Maybe Claire's right.

14:31.103 --> 14:32.900
Maybe if we had a baby together
things would calm down.

14:33.005 --> 14:34.370
Jack, this is what she does.

14:34.573 --> 14:37.337
She sucks you into her craziness,
and you have to fight it.

14:37.443 --> 14:39.911
You have to step up and end this.

14:40.012 --> 14:41.172
I'm scared, Lemon.

14:41.947 --> 14:42.971
I'll do whatever you say.

14:43.115 --> 14:44.082
Okay.

14:45.084 --> 14:46.881
Oh, what a surprise.

14:48.053 --> 14:49.350
What are you two chatting about?

14:49.455 --> 14:51.590
Actually, Claire, we were
talking about you.

14:51.590 --> 14:53.319
And Jack has something
he'd like to tell you.

14:54.159 --> 14:55.126
I do.

14:55.961 --> 14:58.088
I'd like to suck that ring
right off your toe.

14:58.364 --> 14:59.331
...just gotta hack it...

14:59.498 --> 15:02.490
Oh please, stop. Don't make that
angry Muppet face at him.

15:03.535 --> 15:06.138
I know what you were trying to do last night.

15:06.138 --> 15:08.240
You were trying to keep me away from Jack.

15:08.240 --> 15:09.675
And you almost fooled me.

15:09.675 --> 15:11.877
But then I remembered something.

15:11.877 --> 15:13.012
You don't like to have fun.

15:13.012 --> 15:14.980
And now your little plan is backfiring.

15:15.147 --> 15:17.138
And Jack is seeing
the manipulative you.

15:17.549 --> 15:19.915
The Single White Female
thing that you have with me.

15:20.019 --> 15:22.817
I don't have a Single White Female
thing with you!

15:23.055 --> 15:26.047
Honey, you moved into my building.

15:26.458 --> 15:28.756
You always wore chokers
because I wore chokers.

15:28.827 --> 15:30.226
- I like a choker...
- Yes...

15:30.462 --> 15:31.827
You dated that clown.

15:31.997 --> 15:32.964
Joel Sucheki.

15:33.165 --> 15:35.200
First! I dated him first, Claire.

15:35.200 --> 15:38.837
And he was not "that clown" he was
"the" head clowning instructor.

15:38.837 --> 15:39.872
Hmm.

15:39.872 --> 15:41.473
I'm not doing this.

15:41.473 --> 15:44.931
I am only here because Jack is my friend,
and he asked me for support.

15:45.110 --> 15:47.101
Yes, right. That's what I'm saying.

15:47.713 --> 15:49.782
We all want what's best for Jack, right?

15:49.782 --> 15:51.750
So why don't we just
get this three-way on?

15:51.917 --> 15:52.884
- No!
- No!...

15:53.585 --> 15:55.143
...right? That's a bad idea, right?

15:55.821 --> 15:58.187
Well, I tried to be the adult.

15:58.357 --> 16:02.225
And if only one of us can
have him, it's gonna be me.

16:02.294 --> 16:04.023
Jack, you wanted out of this.

16:04.196 --> 16:07.359
Break the cycle! You have a choice.
You can choose Claire, or --

16:07.433 --> 16:09.333
Claire, I would like Claire.

16:09.401 --> 16:10.836
Fine, I am done helping you.

16:10.836 --> 16:13.172
And when you hit rock bottom, which you will,

16:13.172 --> 16:14.867
I am not gonna bail you out.

16:15.007 --> 16:16.872
I'm deleting you from my phone!

16:17.543 --> 16:18.874
Password? What?

16:21.680 --> 16:24.049
Hey, Tracy and Kenneth won't
put me in the "Night Court" finale

16:24.049 --> 16:25.317
they're shooting on stage tonight.

16:25.317 --> 16:26.385
What?

16:26.385 --> 16:27.852
I know!
I'm the werelawyer.

16:32.624 --> 16:33.591
Objection!

16:33.892 --> 16:34.859
Here we go again...

16:35.060 --> 16:36.027
Tell me about it.

16:36.628 --> 16:38.797
The last time I saw either of you,

16:38.797 --> 16:41.129
there was a problem with the page uniforms.

16:41.300 --> 16:43.268
A problem that persists, Liz Lemon.

16:43.569 --> 16:44.593
Hey, are you with network?

16:44.670 --> 16:46.572
How about if Heroes had this new character,

16:46.572 --> 16:48.870
and his super power was close-up magic?

16:49.141 --> 16:51.666
What? No. Big fan, by the way.

16:52.311 --> 16:55.838
You are breaking union rules,
our insurance doesn't cover any of this,

16:56.015 --> 16:59.785
and you are potentially infringing on
Warner Brothers' intellectual property.

16:59.785 --> 17:00.911
Shut this down.

17:01.020 --> 17:03.488
I want a different answer.
Where's Jack Donaghy?

17:03.589 --> 17:05.284
No. There's no more Jack.
He's dead to us.

17:05.590 --> 17:06.648
Break this down!

17:06.892 --> 17:08.193
Everybody out!

17:08.193 --> 17:09.194
I'm sorry.

17:09.194 --> 17:10.194
Can I say something?

17:10.194 --> 17:11.230
Absolutely not.

17:11.230 --> 17:15.723
The only crime any of us is guilty of
is caring for one another.

17:16.201 --> 17:18.294
Mr. Jordan, who tried to cheer me up.

17:18.737 --> 17:20.739
These wonderful actors

17:20.739 --> 17:23.263
who tried to make a
young man's dream come true.

17:23.675 --> 17:25.905
If there is a law against friendship,

17:26.310 --> 17:27.800
then lock me up.

17:28.380 --> 17:30.449
But if there isn't,

17:30.449 --> 17:32.785
then the show must go onward!

17:32.785 --> 17:33.819
What?

17:33.819 --> 17:36.788
Ken, you did it!
You changed her mind!

17:37.156 --> 17:39.021
No. No he didn't!

17:40.059 --> 17:42.391
Stop group hugging!
Who does that?

17:46.031 --> 17:46.998
Isn't this great?

17:47.966 --> 17:49.024
We're together.

17:49.668 --> 17:50.999
We're in line to get into a club.

17:51.570 --> 17:52.537
I have my glowstick...

17:53.405 --> 17:55.270
Uh-huh, yeah.

17:55.707 --> 17:58.198
There's no more Liz
trying to keep us apart.

17:58.377 --> 17:59.605
No more drama.

18:00.779 --> 18:02.514
No more sneaking around,

18:02.514 --> 18:05.984
or recording our intimate moments
to leave on Liz's voicemail.

18:05.984 --> 18:07.052
What?

18:07.052 --> 18:09.521
I don't even know what
this is anymore.

18:09.521 --> 18:13.092
Are we boring? Are we some
sexless couple that sits in silence

18:13.092 --> 18:16.528
at a fish place on a
Sunday night at 5:00?

18:16.528 --> 18:17.930
Because if we are,
I will kill myself.

18:17.930 --> 18:20.728
What? No! We're exciting.
We're having fun.

18:20.866 --> 18:21.833
Yeah?

18:22.534 --> 18:23.967
You really want to have fun, Jack?

18:24.036 --> 18:25.437
Yes! Let's do something wild.

18:25.437 --> 18:27.064
You like it when I get naughty, Jack?

18:27.239 --> 18:28.206
Yeah...

18:29.942 --> 18:31.068
Where the hell did you --?

18:34.379 --> 18:35.414
Crazyputty!

18:35.414 --> 18:38.117
Hey! The guy in the
cool, cool hat has a gun!

18:38.117 --> 18:39.243
Drop it! Now!

18:39.318 --> 18:40.285
- He has a gun!
- No, no, no, no!

18:41.386 --> 18:42.353
Run, Jack!

18:42.454 --> 18:43.421
She's crazyputty!

18:43.622 --> 18:44.589
Run, Jack!

18:50.796 --> 18:53.230
Well, it's been quite a night.

18:53.365 --> 18:55.856
And it's been quite a court... ship.

18:57.202 --> 18:59.771
So by the power vested in me
by the State of New York,

18:59.771 --> 19:02.035
I hereby pronounce us

19:02.174 --> 19:05.043
Mr. and Mrs. Judge Harry T. Stone.

19:05.043 --> 19:06.772
And I may now kiss the bride.

19:07.913 --> 19:08.981
Uh-oh...

19:08.981 --> 19:12.610
It's almost a full "mooon"!

19:13.185 --> 19:14.186
Yeah...

19:14.186 --> 19:17.849
And as my first official act
as a newly married judge,

19:17.990 --> 19:22.757
I hereby declare the new
page uniforms at NBC illegal!

19:23.729 --> 19:25.998
I added that.
I went upstairs and told them,

19:25.998 --> 19:28.200
if they didn't go back
to the old uniforms

19:28.200 --> 19:30.169
I refuse to play the role of Mac

19:30.169 --> 19:32.831
in Universal's upcoming
Night Court movie.

19:33.038 --> 19:34.005
What's that now?

19:34.273 --> 19:35.934
Thank you, Mr. Jordan!

19:42.748 --> 19:43.715
Are you okay?

19:45.851 --> 19:46.818
I thank you very much.

19:47.853 --> 19:49.354
Lemon...

19:49.354 --> 19:51.845
Real night court is not like the TV show.

19:51.924 --> 19:53.025
Remember that TV show?

19:53.025 --> 19:53.992
I do.

19:54.059 --> 19:55.460
I mean, the hookers are not funny.

19:55.460 --> 19:58.861
There's a lot more sickly homeless people
and terrified college students...

20:00.799 --> 20:04.997
Thanks for bailing me out. Claire
threw my wallet down a storm drain.

20:05.270 --> 20:06.237
Ah.

20:06.705 --> 20:08.138
Lemon, I'm sorry I...

20:08.473 --> 20:10.498
I'm just glad you're okay.

20:10.609 --> 20:12.167
Well, thank you for answering your phone.

20:12.244 --> 20:13.905
Well, I don't know
how to decline a call.

20:17.216 --> 20:18.774
Claire used to punch me in the face.

20:18.951 --> 20:19.940
Ugh...

20:20.819 --> 20:22.650
No, Lemon, I'm done. I swear.

20:22.788 --> 20:23.755
Hey, try this on.

20:24.556 --> 20:25.682
That's a good look for you.

20:26.458 --> 20:27.891
You like that? It's yours.

20:28.093 --> 20:30.493
Little Lewis Carrol here.
