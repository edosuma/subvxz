00:01.068 --> 00:03.559
Previously on NCIS: Los Angeles:

00:03.771 --> 00:08.868
My boss wants to assign
a liaison officer from L.A.P.D.

00:09.076 --> 00:10.737
- Going undercover tonight.
- How long?

00:10.945 --> 00:12.572
I don't know.
The cover's pretty deep.

00:12.780 --> 00:14.748
This is every foster home
I ever lived in.

00:15.282 --> 00:16.681
They're all handwritten.

00:16.917 --> 00:21.650
Each address was entered
chronologically all by the same person.

00:21.889 --> 00:23.254
It's an ageing hand.

00:23.457 --> 00:24.583
You had a sister.

00:25.926 --> 00:27.154
Her name was Amy.

00:45.479 --> 00:47.208
Hey.

01:16.710 --> 01:19.838
- Unh.
- Hey.

01:51.512 --> 01:52.740
Hey.

02:02.589 --> 02:03.613
Hey.

02:41.595 --> 02:43.586
Did you catch him this time?

02:45.232 --> 02:48.065
You were twitching
like a sleeping dog.

02:49.336 --> 02:51.736
Well, you know what they say
about sleeping dogs.

02:56.744 --> 02:58.041
I didn't catch him.

02:58.245 --> 02:59.769
Lose him on the Metro?

02:59.947 --> 03:03.815
No, I chased him into a building.

03:03.984 --> 03:05.975
Downtown.

03:06.153 --> 03:09.088
And no, I didn't see his face.

03:09.957 --> 03:11.857
I wonder what Nate
would make of that.

03:12.092 --> 03:14.083
Same thing he made of it
last month.

03:14.595 --> 03:16.825
And the month before that.

03:16.997 --> 03:19.557
"Unresolved identity issues."

03:19.767 --> 03:21.826
Yours,
or the man you were chasing?

03:25.105 --> 03:28.768
You need a place to live, Mr. Callen.

03:28.942 --> 03:30.170
I'm staying at Sam's.

03:30.344 --> 03:34.576
Spare rooms and office couches,
flophouse floors

03:34.782 --> 03:37.342
are not conducive to a restful sleep.

03:37.584 --> 03:39.518
And I need you awake.

03:42.356 --> 03:43.687
Someone's gone missing.

03:44.324 --> 03:46.815
- Who?
- Deeks.

04:09.116 --> 04:11.084
- You never asked.
- You've never offered.

04:11.251 --> 04:12.912
- I should offer?
- You never offer.

04:13.120 --> 04:14.382
- Never?
- Ever.

04:14.555 --> 04:16.750
I feel bad. You offered.

04:16.923 --> 04:19.892
- That's why I'm telling you not to offer.
- But I've got a spare room.

04:20.060 --> 04:22.051
Okay, so there's some stuff in it.
A lot of stuff.

04:22.229 --> 04:24.390
But I could clear a space on the floor,
a small space.

04:24.565 --> 04:25.896
Kensi, G does not sleep.

04:26.066 --> 04:28.933
- He catnaps 20 minutes at a time.
- That is not so bad.

04:29.136 --> 04:31.934
Then he gets up, moves around,
makes his tea, pulls the toaster apart,

04:32.139 --> 04:35.165
puts it back together,
practices his Russian.

04:35.342 --> 04:37.003
Okay, that could be irritating.

04:37.177 --> 04:39.941
- He doesn't sleep, so you can't.
- Well, he never looks tired.

04:40.180 --> 04:41.909
- Morning.
- Hey.

04:42.916 --> 04:43.940
You look like crap.

04:44.184 --> 04:45.879
Thank you.

04:46.453 --> 04:48.182
- Hey...
- Do not offer.

04:54.695 --> 04:58.392
Ms. Blye, Mr. Hanna, oversleep again,
did you?

05:00.300 --> 05:04.293
Early this morning,
I got a call from the L.A.P.D.

05:04.471 --> 05:07.065
They've lost contact
with Detective Deeks.

05:07.674 --> 05:12.077
He's been on an extended undercover
assignment since he left us.

05:12.246 --> 05:15.113
- How long has he been out of contact?
- Yesterday afternoon.

05:15.883 --> 05:18.408
It's kind of soon to be hitting
the panic button, isn't it?

05:18.585 --> 05:19.609
Mr. Beale.

05:19.786 --> 05:23.552
Fourteen hours ago, a bomb detonated
in this car in South Central.

05:23.757 --> 05:25.918
Two occupants, both killed.

05:26.159 --> 05:29.617
Emilio Philip Ortega and his bodyguard,
Luis Manuel Fellano.

05:29.796 --> 05:33.129
Both with extensive records,
mostly relating to acts of violence.

05:33.300 --> 05:38.328
And both the target of Detective Deeks'
undercover assignment.

05:38.505 --> 05:42.839
His case officer phoned to see
if he'd been in contact with us.

05:43.010 --> 05:44.637
I offered our assistance.

05:44.811 --> 05:46.836
Is there a military angle to this?

05:47.014 --> 05:51.144
No, but Detective Deeks is still
our liaison officer with the L.A.P.D.

05:51.752 --> 05:56.246
Which makes him
about as close to one of us as it gets.

05:56.456 --> 06:00.290
His case officer, Detective
Jess Traynor, will brief you all.

06:00.494 --> 06:02.689
Deeks should have phoned
in the moment that happened.

06:03.363 --> 06:05.024
Hence the panic button.

06:07.200 --> 06:09.498
The late Emilio Ortega.

06:09.670 --> 06:11.865
Born in San Diego,
mother and father both illegal.

06:12.072 --> 06:15.132
Collected a string of juvenile offences
when he was younger.

06:15.309 --> 06:19.507
Worked with his father as a smuggler
crossing the Mexican border.

06:19.680 --> 06:22.581
After his father was killed,
Emilio drifted up to L.A.

06:22.783 --> 06:26.184
And joined a street gang
that specialized in extortion.

06:26.353 --> 06:28.514
After three years
Emilio was the man.

06:28.689 --> 06:31.180
Figure he'd killed a couple
of his friends on the way up.

06:31.391 --> 06:32.722
Oh, that's surprising.

06:32.893 --> 06:35.361
Six months ago
an informant gave us intel

06:35.529 --> 06:38.498
that suggested that Emilio
was planning a career change.

06:38.699 --> 06:41.725
Someone wanted to buy
his particular skills.

06:41.902 --> 06:43.529
Well, being a good standover guy

06:43.704 --> 06:46.002
isn't an uncommon skill
in an L.A. Street gang.

06:46.206 --> 06:50.108
But knowing how to move freely
across the Mexican-U.S. Border is.

06:50.310 --> 06:52.039
Emilio's father taught him well.

06:52.245 --> 06:54.611
- Drugs for guns?
- Human trafficking.

06:54.848 --> 06:57.214
We think young women and girls
from as far away as Brazil.

06:57.584 --> 06:58.608
Who approached him?

06:58.819 --> 07:00.844
A Serbian by the name of Lazik.

07:01.021 --> 07:02.386
Not a lot is known about him.

07:02.556 --> 07:04.547
No criminal record
because he's never been caught.

07:04.725 --> 07:07.853
Rumored to run a human trafficking
ring in Europe.

07:08.061 --> 07:09.255
Going global.

07:09.429 --> 07:13.365
Lazik put up the money for
Emilio to buy a string of safe houses.

07:13.567 --> 07:16.229
But Emilio needed someone
who understood the real estate world,

07:16.403 --> 07:18.200
- so we gave him one.
- Deeks.

07:18.372 --> 07:20.897
He went in as a lawyer
who'd had his license revoked

07:21.074 --> 07:23.542
because of a couple of shady
land deals.

07:23.710 --> 07:29.046
It was easy for Marty...
Detective Deeks... To spin it.

07:29.216 --> 07:31.081
- You know he was a lawyer?
- Yeah, I know.

07:32.285 --> 07:33.411
So who killed Emilio?

07:33.587 --> 07:35.612
Emilio was pissed
that he'd done all the work

07:35.789 --> 07:37.757
and that Lazik was going
to make all the money.

07:37.924 --> 07:39.619
He told Deeks
he was gonna do something.

07:39.860 --> 07:43.125
- Someone must have tipped Lazik off.
- And now he's reasserting control.

07:43.363 --> 07:44.489
Where does this leave Deeks?

07:45.265 --> 07:46.493
I wish I knew.

07:49.603 --> 07:51.332
- Cell phone?
- Turned off.

07:51.505 --> 07:52.563
GPS tracker?

07:52.739 --> 07:54.366
We only tagged Deeks' car,

07:54.574 --> 07:56.906
and we found it a couple blocks away
from our safe house.

07:57.077 --> 07:58.840
We have protocols
for this kind of situation

07:59.012 --> 08:00.946
and Deeks hasn't responded
to any of them.

08:01.114 --> 08:04.242
- Who spoke to him last?
- I did.

08:06.953 --> 08:07.977
Regular debrief.

08:08.188 --> 08:11.316
Hmm. Shared intel.
Need to know everything.

08:11.525 --> 08:13.288
And you will.

08:14.761 --> 08:15.887
You think he's dead?

08:17.431 --> 08:21.197
Nothing for 16 hours?
What do you think?

08:24.604 --> 08:25.935
She's holding something back.

08:26.707 --> 08:29.505
I think she likes him.
Doesn't want to admit it.

08:29.676 --> 08:32.907
No, it's something else.
It's like she's hiding something.

08:33.714 --> 08:35.477
So let's ask her.

09:04.743 --> 09:05.971
You know what, Callen?

09:06.145 --> 09:08.045
You know,
I don't need to say anything to you.

09:08.247 --> 09:11.546
I don't need to share.
I don't need your advice.

09:11.750 --> 09:13.843
What I do need
is for you to let me do my job.

09:14.052 --> 09:15.349
Your crime scene.

09:15.554 --> 09:17.283
- Who's this guy?
- With me.

09:17.456 --> 09:19.617
- Sam Hanna.
- Frank Scarli.

09:19.791 --> 09:22.089
- How many guys did Traynor brief?
- Three.

09:23.962 --> 09:25.623
I need witness statements
from all of you.

09:25.797 --> 09:27.594
Don't leave anything out.

09:27.799 --> 09:29.096
Sorry for your loss.

09:31.069 --> 09:33.469
- Was she your partner?
- No.

09:34.139 --> 09:36.004
Deeks was her partner.

09:36.241 --> 09:37.936
They'd just started working together.

09:39.378 --> 09:41.403
I didn't envy him either.
She could be difficult.

09:41.613 --> 09:45.140
Four months on this case. Know what
they had at the end of four months?

09:45.384 --> 09:48.251
They had nothing
and nobody could figure out why.

09:48.420 --> 09:51.014
Did she tell you that
when she briefed you?

09:53.025 --> 09:54.322
No, I didn't think so.

09:54.526 --> 09:57.154
This case was stone-cold dead
yesterday morning.

09:58.130 --> 10:00.257
It wasn't going anywhere.

10:00.432 --> 10:01.660
Now I've got a cop dead,

10:01.833 --> 10:03.994
I've got two missing,
and I've got a triple homicide.

10:04.803 --> 10:05.827
Lazik?

10:06.004 --> 10:09.337
Emilio Ortega's got a lot of guys
out there that would love to whack him.

10:09.508 --> 10:11.772
No thought of killing a cop
or two either.

10:11.977 --> 10:14.502
But he's going to learn
something now.

10:15.180 --> 10:17.171
He's going to learn
that you can't do this

10:17.349 --> 10:21.513
and not pay for it here,
because California isn't Mexico.

10:21.687 --> 10:22.949
Not yet, anyway.

10:23.155 --> 10:25.988
What if Deeks is still alive?
What if his cover hasn't been blown?

10:26.725 --> 10:28.955
You take a good look
over there at Traynor.

10:29.161 --> 10:33.655
And then you let me know
if you think that Deeks is still alive.

10:35.234 --> 10:37.896
L.A.P.D. Investigation,
stay out of our way.

10:38.070 --> 10:40.368
He's looking for payback.

10:42.241 --> 10:45.210
I've seen this before,
same kind of blast pattern,

10:45.444 --> 10:46.570
same size detonation.

10:46.812 --> 10:47.972
Where?

10:48.180 --> 10:50.171
Crime scene photos
from Emilio's car this morning.

10:50.382 --> 10:53.977
There wasn't a timer, there's no way
of guaranteeing she'd be in the car.

10:54.152 --> 10:57.246
Yeah, and not enough time to wire it
to the ignition either, which leaves...

10:57.456 --> 10:58.889
Remote.

10:59.091 --> 11:02.060
They were out here, waiting for her.

11:12.004 --> 11:13.596
Nate.

11:15.507 --> 11:16.735
You rang?

11:17.276 --> 11:19.767
I called, I didn't ring, Nate.

11:20.012 --> 11:21.206
I meant, like...

11:21.413 --> 11:22.675
Okay.

11:22.848 --> 11:24.475
Two unrelated questions.

11:24.683 --> 11:27.345
Shoot. I mean, ask away, ask away.

11:29.921 --> 11:31.912
Uh, as I'm sure you're aware,

11:32.090 --> 11:35.924
Mr. Callen is staying over
in Mr. Hanna's spare room.

11:36.094 --> 11:37.118
Yes.

11:37.296 --> 11:41.562
In your professional opinion,
and knowing Mr. Callen as you do,

11:41.733 --> 11:45.294
do you think there's any benefit for him
in this arrangement?

11:45.504 --> 11:48.564
Well, the upside is it puts him
in a home environment

11:48.740 --> 11:50.867
with somebody he knows and trusts.

11:51.410 --> 11:52.468
And the downside?

11:52.644 --> 11:55.943
It puts subtle pressures
and strains on their relationship.

11:56.114 --> 11:57.411
I've noticed.

11:57.616 --> 11:59.641
Mr. Hanna looks like crap.

12:01.086 --> 12:04.078
And in the long term, it does nothing
to help Callen resolve his issues

12:04.256 --> 12:07.384
of abandonment and isolation
he's suffered since he was a child.

12:08.727 --> 12:10.092
He needs his own place, Hetty.

12:10.295 --> 12:12.286
Don't we all?

12:14.433 --> 12:16.128
A second unrelated question.

12:16.335 --> 12:18.633
Do you have plans
for this weekend?

12:18.837 --> 12:20.668
- Plans?
- Plans.

12:25.644 --> 12:26.975
Are you asking me out?

12:29.681 --> 12:32.081
No, that'd be weird. Uh...

12:33.685 --> 12:36.586
No, no plans, no plans.

12:36.788 --> 12:38.119
Good.

12:39.658 --> 12:40.784
Thank you, Nate.

12:41.860 --> 12:43.487
Thank you.

12:47.466 --> 12:49.627
This guy Lazik is one smooth operator.

12:49.801 --> 12:51.359
Links to the Russian mafia,

12:51.603 --> 12:53.764
suspected of laundering money
for the Colombians,

12:53.939 --> 12:57.272
suspected links to the heroin trade
out of Afghanistan.

12:57.476 --> 12:59.467
Suspected of organizing
or being directly involved

12:59.644 --> 13:00.941
in at least five murders.

13:01.113 --> 13:03.445
The most anyone's been able
to catch him for is speeding.

13:03.648 --> 13:07.175
He travels a lot.
In and out of Europe all the time.

13:07.352 --> 13:10.879
Multiple trips to Africa,
the Middle East, South America.

13:11.123 --> 13:15.116
- Always on his own passport.
- He's done nothing wrong.

13:15.293 --> 13:17.318
Why tempt fate
by using a false passport?

13:17.496 --> 13:19.361
Eric?

13:20.232 --> 13:22.860
Find him.
I want to know where he is right now.

13:23.101 --> 13:24.659
I've been working on that.

13:24.836 --> 13:27.634
He's using a smart passport,
electronically tagged.

13:27.839 --> 13:28.863
He's on the move.

13:29.040 --> 13:31.975
Paris, Dubai,
and we've got a final destination,

13:32.144 --> 13:34.374
but you're not gonna like it.

13:36.815 --> 13:39.978
Taken at an immigration gateway
24 hours ago.

13:40.819 --> 13:42.980
- Where?
- Los Angeles.

14:02.374 --> 14:03.841
Whoo.

14:04.843 --> 14:06.071
You shoot with your left hand?

14:08.747 --> 14:10.772
Not often.

14:14.586 --> 14:16.213
Impressive.

14:17.789 --> 14:18.881
First shot missed.

14:19.057 --> 14:22.390
Well, I think you would have gotten
his attention.

14:24.062 --> 14:25.461
So Lazik, the Serbian,

14:26.765 --> 14:28.858
he just landed in Los Angeles
yesterday.

14:29.034 --> 14:32.902
Two hours before
Emilio Ortega was killed.

14:33.071 --> 14:34.436
And?

14:34.606 --> 14:35.937
L.A.P.D. Doesn't want to share.

14:36.174 --> 14:41.771
Well, that's understandable given what
transpired with Detective Traynor.

14:41.947 --> 14:44.472
Yeah, they told us
to stay out of their way.

14:44.683 --> 14:47.117
Then that's what you should do.

14:47.285 --> 14:50.277
Stay out of their way
and find Mr. Deeks.

14:52.057 --> 14:54.582
They're not going to like it
if they catch us.

14:54.759 --> 14:57.057
Then don't get caught.

15:04.803 --> 15:08.261
Lange. Where?

15:09.341 --> 15:11.138
When?

15:11.309 --> 15:12.936
I will.

15:17.082 --> 15:19.642
Find Lazik, Mr. Callen.

15:41.373 --> 15:44.467
We were beginning to think
you were dead.

15:45.377 --> 15:47.038
Not yet.

15:51.516 --> 15:53.381
Maybe tomorrow.

16:06.229 --> 16:07.719
It's a...

16:07.898 --> 16:10.196
It's a Cyrillic alphabet.
Russian, yeah?

16:10.367 --> 16:12.028
You play?

16:12.202 --> 16:14.363
In English. Heh.

16:14.538 --> 16:18.565
And badly in Russian, yeah.

16:18.742 --> 16:20.869
It's giving me a headache
just thinking about it.

16:23.547 --> 16:24.571
What's that word?

16:27.084 --> 16:28.745
It means "danger."

16:29.386 --> 16:32.822
Great, so a Russian Scrabble
Ouija board, then.

16:33.056 --> 16:35.718
You're not too badly hurt.

16:35.892 --> 16:38.383
- I'm stinging all over here.
- Hmm.

16:40.097 --> 16:44.056
I was in Emilio's car and his remote
for his security gate malfunctioned,

16:44.234 --> 16:46.725
so I jumped out to open it and...

16:50.340 --> 16:52.740
You know, a few seconds
either way, of course, and...

16:53.944 --> 16:56.242
So Emilio's bodyguards threw me
in the back of their car

16:56.413 --> 16:58.176
and got me to a doctor.

16:58.348 --> 17:02.079
Which, in retrospect,
I was pretty sure was a vet.

17:03.920 --> 17:07.617
He patched me up and shot me
with a horse tranquillizer

17:07.790 --> 17:08.951
and put me out for 15 hours.

17:09.126 --> 17:11.094
When I came to, I...

17:11.528 --> 17:12.728
I tried to call her but she...

17:12.863 --> 17:14.353
Detective Traynor.

17:17.867 --> 17:19.460
Too late.

17:21.938 --> 17:25.101
So why did you call me
instead of the L.A.P. D?

17:27.544 --> 17:30.536
Because L.A.P.D. Would've just shut
down the operation, pulled me off it.

17:30.781 --> 17:33.045
There is no operation, Mr. Deeks.

17:33.250 --> 17:35.718
The operation died
with Detective Traynor.

17:35.886 --> 17:37.786
Okay, listen.
Lazik's in town, all right?

17:37.954 --> 17:39.114
My friendly vet told me this.

17:39.289 --> 17:41.280
Soon as Emilio's bodyguards
found out, they split.

17:41.458 --> 17:42.982
This is a scary guy, Lazik.

17:43.193 --> 17:45.286
So you think he's responsible?

17:45.495 --> 17:47.019
Are you kidding me? Who doesn't?

17:47.197 --> 17:51.566
Well, L.A.P.D. Seems to think Emilio
had a lot of enemies.

17:51.768 --> 17:53.531
No, no, no.
It's got to be Lazik, all right?

17:53.703 --> 17:55.193
Every time he called
they would argue.

17:55.372 --> 17:58.364
Emilio was setting up a pipeline for
Lazik to smuggle girls out of Mexico.

17:58.542 --> 18:02.205
We're talking about abducted,
underage, and drug...

18:07.150 --> 18:09.516
Drugged girls.

18:09.719 --> 18:11.186
But you have no proof.

18:11.388 --> 18:14.084
Yeah, because the first shipment
would have been the proof.

18:15.025 --> 18:19.155
So, what exactly
do you want from me, Mr. Deeks?

18:19.329 --> 18:21.354
To help me finish what we started.

18:21.898 --> 18:23.365
Lazik put a lot of money into this.

18:23.533 --> 18:26.024
He's not going to want to turn
his back on that.

18:26.803 --> 18:29.738
He's looking for a replacement
for Emilio.

18:30.607 --> 18:32.006
That's all I want.

18:37.681 --> 18:40.206
Safe house.
The address is on the tag.

18:40.383 --> 18:42.442
Get some sleep,
call me in the morning.

18:42.686 --> 18:47.385
I'll see what I can do, but I have no
jurisdiction over the L.A.P.D.

18:47.591 --> 18:49.388
They could simply tell me
to bugger off.

18:52.028 --> 18:53.962
Well, I'd like to see them try.

18:57.400 --> 19:01.268
I think you got a triple word score
there with the...

19:01.438 --> 19:04.373
One with all the squiggly letters.
What's it mean?

19:04.541 --> 19:06.839
"Be careful."

19:07.043 --> 19:11.377
Okay. I'm pretty sure
you just made that up, but I, uh...

19:11.548 --> 19:13.277
But I will.

19:14.217 --> 19:16.651
And, um, thank you.

19:37.140 --> 19:38.164
Mr. Callen.

19:44.581 --> 19:48.483
I don't take kindly to being tailed.

19:48.652 --> 19:50.381
Well, I'm more a wingman
than a tail-man.

19:50.587 --> 19:52.521
How did you know?

19:54.191 --> 19:58.594
Well, before the call,
it was "Find Deeks."

19:58.762 --> 20:01.253
After the call, it was "Find Lazik."

20:01.431 --> 20:03.422
Careless of me.

20:03.600 --> 20:06.194
Well, we need to find Lazik
before he finds Deeks.

20:15.312 --> 20:17.041
Goody.

20:22.485 --> 20:24.043
- Where'd you go?
- Deeks is okay.

20:24.254 --> 20:26.381
- You actually spoke to him?
- No, Hetty did.

20:26.556 --> 20:29.218
He's fine. He's a little shaken
but she put him in our safe house.

20:29.392 --> 20:31.326
- What do you got?
- A chink in Lazik's armor.

20:31.494 --> 20:32.927
He has a serious cocaine addiction.

20:33.096 --> 20:35.360
According to the L.A.P.D. File,
Lazik's been to L.A.

20:35.532 --> 20:37.022
Three times in the last 12 months.

20:37.200 --> 20:39.532
Never stays in the same place twice.
Always moving around.

20:39.703 --> 20:42.729
But he uses the same dealer
every visit, guy called Tommy Bishop.

20:42.973 --> 20:45.066
- How do we find him?
- Bright yellow '87 Camaro.

20:45.242 --> 20:47.073
Up and down Hollywood
Boulevard all day long.

20:47.244 --> 20:48.734
Does his deals on a satellite phone.

20:48.912 --> 20:50.539
- Can we intercept it?
- It's encrypted.

20:50.747 --> 20:52.408
Then we intercept him.

20:52.582 --> 20:55.176
- Got a plan?
- Yeah.

20:55.352 --> 20:56.785
You.

21:04.728 --> 21:06.525
Real deal, this is pure acid, man.

21:06.930 --> 21:09.524
You didn't tell me
Tommy Bishop looks like a pimp.

21:09.733 --> 21:10.893
Kensi, you're on.

21:11.101 --> 21:12.432
You know what I'm saying?

21:12.636 --> 21:14.126
Have I ever done bad by you?

21:16.106 --> 21:18.006
- Oh, man.
- I'm sorry.

21:18.208 --> 21:19.505
Look at my car.

21:19.709 --> 21:20.937
- Look at my car.
- Oh, my God.

21:21.111 --> 21:23.204
Lady, you had the whole street.
Look at this.

21:23.380 --> 21:25.541
I'm so sorry, I was texting.
It's completely my fault.

21:25.715 --> 21:28.149
I looked down for a second,
and then when I looked back up...

21:28.318 --> 21:31.515
- You were texting?
- This is really, really bad.

21:31.721 --> 21:35.384
So maybe we should exchange
insurance information or something?

21:37.160 --> 21:39.025
Just forget it, all right?

21:39.229 --> 21:40.821
- Forget it.
- Come on, it was my fault.

21:41.031 --> 21:44.626
- I should have to pay for it.
- No need, okay? I got it.

21:44.834 --> 21:47.962
Really? Seriously?

21:48.138 --> 21:50.629
- Thank you.
- It's okay.

21:50.840 --> 21:52.808
- It's okay, don't worry about it.
- Thank you.

21:52.976 --> 21:54.773
If you can't bug the phone,
bug the man.

21:54.944 --> 21:56.809
Eric, the bug is planted.

21:57.047 --> 21:59.072
Okay, Sam, activating the bug.

22:03.987 --> 22:05.682
We've got a problem, Eric. Stand by.

22:08.258 --> 22:09.623
Stay put.

22:09.793 --> 22:11.954
What's going on here, man?

22:12.162 --> 22:14.153
I'm telling you,
you've got the wrong dude.

22:14.364 --> 22:16.195
- L.A.P.D., stay right where you are.
- Hey.

22:16.433 --> 22:20.164
- Whoa, whoa, whoa. Detective Scarli.
- I told you to stay out of this, didn't I?

22:20.370 --> 22:22.804
- This guy's ours.
- The hell he is yours.

22:23.006 --> 22:24.769
This is an L.A.P.D. Bust.

22:24.974 --> 22:27.204
I told you people I would settle this.

22:27.377 --> 22:30.312
Every address,
every name in Traynor's file.

22:30.480 --> 22:33.472
That means you need to stay
the hell out of our way.

22:33.650 --> 22:35.948
Do you understand
what I'm saying, Agent Hanna?

22:36.119 --> 22:37.711
Yeah, we got it.

22:37.954 --> 22:39.512
Great.

22:41.591 --> 22:43.388
Oh, man,
why are you messing with me?

22:44.327 --> 22:45.851
There goes our plan.

22:46.796 --> 22:49.492
I guess we'll just have to go
with plan B.

23:05.080 --> 23:06.377
Tommy Bishop's phone.

23:06.582 --> 23:09.244
- Do we know if Lazik called him?
- You're gonna find out, Eric.

23:09.451 --> 23:10.509
Crack the encryption.

23:10.686 --> 23:12.210
See who he's called. Got it.

23:12.387 --> 23:15.185
And have we got something for you.

23:16.592 --> 23:19.220
Emilio Ortega's cell phone log.

23:19.428 --> 23:21.419
Eric ran a check of the numbers
made and received.

23:21.597 --> 23:23.690
Came up with this number.

23:23.865 --> 23:25.765
Twenty-seven calls
in the last six months.

23:25.934 --> 23:26.958
Most of them incoming.

23:27.202 --> 23:29.864
Call durations varied.
Some were a few seconds.

23:30.038 --> 23:31.630
Most five, ten minutes in length.

23:31.873 --> 23:33.966
- Do we have a name?
- It's kind of hard to believe.

23:34.142 --> 23:37.236
- Try us, Nate.
- Detective Jess Traynor.

23:38.480 --> 23:40.812
Like I said, kind of hard to believe.

23:40.983 --> 23:42.883
- That a landline or cell phone?
- Cell phone.

23:43.051 --> 23:44.541
Now, we managed...

23:44.720 --> 23:47.280
Eric managed
to access the voice mail.

23:48.390 --> 23:49.584
Only one message.

23:49.758 --> 23:52.318
Emilio, it's Traynor.

23:52.494 --> 23:55.327
We need to meet.
Two hours' time, same place.

23:55.497 --> 23:56.987
Call me back if you can't make it.

23:57.232 --> 23:58.756
Face time as well as phone time.

23:58.967 --> 24:01.800
More than once.
When was that message left?

24:02.004 --> 24:03.733
One hour before Emilio was killed.

24:03.939 --> 24:06.669
- Did he call her back?
- No.

24:06.875 --> 24:08.137
He was gonna make the meet.

24:08.377 --> 24:11.312
Deeks' L.A.P.D. Handler
is on Emilio's payroll.

24:11.813 --> 24:13.838
Scarli said the operation
was going nowhere.

24:14.016 --> 24:16.644
They had nothing.
Might explain why.

24:16.885 --> 24:19.479
Was Traynor sabotaging
her own operation? I mean...

24:20.322 --> 24:22.586
- Nate?
- It's possible.

24:22.758 --> 24:24.783
She certainly wouldn't be the first.

24:24.960 --> 24:27.087
Motive would probably be money.

24:27.295 --> 24:29.763
Lazik finds out Emilio's
got a cop on the payroll,

24:29.931 --> 24:32.399
doesn't like it, tags both of them.

24:32.601 --> 24:34.000
Where does this leave Deeks?

24:34.169 --> 24:36.262
Next on Lazik's hit list.

24:36.438 --> 24:37.632
If he knew about Traynor,

24:37.806 --> 24:39.637
we've got to believe he knew
about Deeks.

24:39.841 --> 24:41.706
Hey, guys. I'm in.

24:42.344 --> 24:44.335
Bishop encrypted
everyone's name and number

24:44.513 --> 24:46.504
but he should have paid
for the security updates.

24:46.682 --> 24:49.310
His encryption program's
so last week.

24:50.152 --> 24:52.677
Lazik called Bishop 20 minutes
after he landed.

24:52.921 --> 24:54.479
Long flight. Lazik needed to score.

24:54.690 --> 24:56.681
All right, his phone is on
and we are searching.

24:58.794 --> 25:00.785
Got him.
Well, his cell phone, at least.

25:00.962 --> 25:02.930
Let's hope Lazik didn't lend it
to a friend.

25:03.131 --> 25:04.428
Only one way to find out.

25:12.074 --> 25:15.202
Hello? Hello.

25:16.712 --> 25:19.146
Pulling up Lazik's passport photo,

25:19.314 --> 25:22.442
and he did not lend his cell phone
to a friend.

25:22.651 --> 25:24.846
- All right, what now?
- Deeks is a cop.

25:25.053 --> 25:28.887
So technically we should pass the intel
on to Detective Scarli at L.A.P.D.

25:31.326 --> 25:33.191
But Deeks is our cop, so... Ahem.

25:33.395 --> 25:34.589
Address, Eric.

25:36.498 --> 25:38.261
It's an industrial reserve.

25:38.500 --> 25:40.832
Decommissioned power plant.
It's off the 101.

25:41.002 --> 25:42.230
Check for security cameras.

25:42.471 --> 25:43.836
Have I ever let you down?

25:44.039 --> 25:46.371
Don't answer that.

25:46.575 --> 25:48.736
So the plant
is still owned by the state,

25:48.910 --> 25:51.071
even though they hauled away
the generators years ago.

25:51.246 --> 25:55.580
With a little luck they've maintained
the security cameras.

25:55.784 --> 25:58.617
Decommissioned for years but the
old cameras are still standing watch.

26:00.021 --> 26:03.013
Our taxes at work.
Gotta love that bureaucracy.

26:03.225 --> 26:06.251
You mean the bureaucracy
we work for.

26:06.428 --> 26:07.895
Like I said. Love that bureaucracy.

26:24.713 --> 26:26.203
There's only one way in.

26:26.381 --> 26:27.871
There's only one way out.

26:28.083 --> 26:29.880
- They'll see us coming.
- And hear us.

26:32.554 --> 26:33.885
- Yo.
- Any luck?

26:34.055 --> 26:36.717
Two cameras, both exterior.
Three cars in the parking lot.

26:36.892 --> 26:38.655
No sign of anyone
outside the building.

26:38.894 --> 26:41.795
- What do you got on the cars?
- I'm still working on that.

26:42.030 --> 26:43.258
Limited zoom on those cameras,

26:43.431 --> 26:45.956
so I had to do
some serious enhancements.

26:46.168 --> 26:48.568
Two of the cars are rentals.

26:48.737 --> 26:51.570
Both hired
by our elusive Serbian friend, Lazik.

26:51.773 --> 26:54.799
And I am running the registration
on the third car now.

26:54.976 --> 26:58.673
I'm just pulling up
the driver's license.

26:58.847 --> 27:00.439
- Oh, crap.
- Eric?

27:00.649 --> 27:03.083
The car is registered
to Dale John Sully.

27:03.285 --> 27:06.254
Callen, that's Deeks' alias.

27:06.454 --> 27:08.183
Thanks, Eric.

27:10.258 --> 27:11.987
Deeks is in there.

27:13.929 --> 27:16.523
If Lazik knows he's a cop...

27:16.698 --> 27:18.689
- We need a plan.
- Fast.

27:24.206 --> 27:26.197
You got any duct tape?

27:28.710 --> 27:30.610
Don't move.

27:40.922 --> 27:41.980
He's clean.

27:44.626 --> 27:46.150
Sure.

27:46.595 --> 27:47.892
I love you too.

27:48.096 --> 27:49.222
Ciao.

27:54.870 --> 27:56.337
Sorry.

27:56.872 --> 27:58.362
My wife.

28:01.176 --> 28:02.803
What?

28:02.978 --> 28:05.003
You're surprised I have wife?

28:05.180 --> 28:07.011
Everybody's got to have somebody,
right?

28:07.215 --> 28:11.914
Now that I'm cutting my trip short,
she want to meet me in Paris.

28:12.921 --> 28:14.752
I'm good husband.

28:15.891 --> 28:18.621
You are very brave
for coming to see me.

28:18.827 --> 28:20.658
I understand that Emilio
screwed up.

28:20.829 --> 28:23.764
- I didn't have anything to do with that.
- Emilio lied to me.

28:23.999 --> 28:25.023
Okay.

28:25.200 --> 28:29.068
He had contact in L.A.P.D.
But he did not tell me that.

28:30.272 --> 28:32.740
So he have to pay price
for poor judgment.

28:33.275 --> 28:36.676
And now because of that, four months'
work and lots of money wasted.

28:36.845 --> 28:39.712
That's why I'm here.
It's not wasted if you let me take over.

28:41.349 --> 28:42.509
You hear?

28:42.684 --> 28:44.584
Business proposition.

28:44.753 --> 28:47.779
I helped set up the safe houses.
I know the people to pay at the border.

28:48.690 --> 28:50.590
So? Go on.

28:50.792 --> 28:52.419
All I'm asking for here
is one shipment.

28:52.594 --> 28:54.528
All right?
I screw it up, you close it down.

28:54.696 --> 28:56.186
Nothing lost. If I make this happen,

28:56.398 --> 28:59.094
you and I, we're in business.

28:59.301 --> 29:02.759
And all that money is not wasted.

29:05.440 --> 29:07.032
You are very persuasive.

29:07.242 --> 29:08.766
Thank you.

29:08.944 --> 29:12.072
But I am afraid it's not going to work.

29:12.280 --> 29:14.942
It can work.
You've just got to give me a chance.

29:19.754 --> 29:21.483
It's a shame.

29:22.057 --> 29:25.754
Working with you would have been
so much more interesting than Emilio.

29:25.927 --> 29:28.088
Still can be.

29:28.263 --> 29:30.629
No, it cannot be,

29:30.799 --> 29:32.061
Mr. Deeks.

29:35.236 --> 29:37.136
Pardonnez-moi.

29:38.239 --> 29:39.399
Detective Deeks.

29:39.574 --> 29:41.769
L.A.P.D.

29:47.615 --> 29:48.946
It's a shame.

29:49.150 --> 29:51.812
My wife would really like you.

30:14.674 --> 30:16.938
- Kensi, you online?
- Online and in position.

30:17.177 --> 30:19.270
- Sam?
- We're set. You're good to go.

30:37.364 --> 30:39.298
You don't have to go through this.

30:39.466 --> 30:41.696
Okay,
I'm just going to be on my way, then.

30:45.972 --> 30:48.202
You just need to tell me
how far this goes.

30:48.809 --> 30:50.970
Is it Interpol?

30:51.178 --> 30:52.941
Does it reach me in Europe?
Serbia?

30:53.680 --> 30:55.671
It goes all the way to your bedroom,
Popof.

30:59.753 --> 31:01.778
You think I don't know about you?

31:02.622 --> 31:05.056
I find out about you long time ago.

31:05.258 --> 31:07.055
Emilio,

31:07.994 --> 31:09.461
he never told me how he knew.

31:09.629 --> 31:11.620
But I find out he's making payoff
to someone

31:11.798 --> 31:13.925
in your office with my money.

31:14.100 --> 31:15.590
Mine!

31:16.269 --> 31:17.327
That's too bad.

31:25.212 --> 31:27.180
Yeah.

31:27.347 --> 31:29.508
I wanted to see how far this goes.

31:29.716 --> 31:30.842
Yeah.

31:31.017 --> 31:32.143
So I had him followed.

31:37.257 --> 31:38.724
You know her?

31:42.462 --> 31:45.158
- I've never seen her before.
- No?

31:45.332 --> 31:46.458
No.

31:46.633 --> 31:47.998
She's foxy though, right?

31:55.542 --> 31:58.773
Taken outside
Detective Traynor's apartment.

31:59.613 --> 32:01.513
You liked her, no?

32:05.385 --> 32:07.376
You like dirty cop?

32:08.288 --> 32:09.755
She dirty in bed too?

32:13.627 --> 32:16.892
Maybe Emilio didn't have
to pay her much after all.

32:20.667 --> 32:23.158
- You can't come here.
- Relax, pal, all right?

32:23.370 --> 32:25.531
I've got a special delivery
from Tommy Bishop

32:25.705 --> 32:27.832
for his good friend Mr. Lazik.

32:36.716 --> 32:37.808
Let's go.

32:55.368 --> 32:57.836
Who are you? What do you want?

32:58.038 --> 32:59.437
I'm guessing you're Mr. Lazik.

32:59.906 --> 33:00.930
Lazik.

33:01.107 --> 33:03.405
Tommy has a buying opportunity.

33:03.610 --> 33:06.511
Thought you might be interested
in a business proposition.

33:08.548 --> 33:09.572
No.

33:26.399 --> 33:28.765
Federal agents. No one move.
Let's see your hands.

33:38.545 --> 33:39.876
- Deeks?
- I'm good.

34:53.953 --> 34:55.716
Couple more minutes
I could have taken them.

34:55.955 --> 34:58.116
Hey, Deeks. It's good to see you.

34:59.059 --> 35:00.117
Good to see you too, Sam.

35:00.293 --> 35:03.126
- Callen, Sam.
- Clear, Kensi.

35:03.730 --> 35:07.063
- I told you I'd be back.
- Oh, shut up.

35:09.836 --> 35:12.464
Lazik found out that Emilio
was paying off a dirty cop.

35:12.639 --> 35:14.732
Traynor. We know.

35:34.961 --> 35:35.985
Deeks.

35:37.564 --> 35:38.588
Black, two sugars, right?

35:41.735 --> 35:43.999
I'm glad you made it, kid.

35:44.204 --> 35:45.535
Yeah, well, I almost didn't.

35:47.273 --> 35:49.002
So, what do I do?

35:49.175 --> 35:51.109
- About what?
- About Traynor?

35:51.277 --> 35:52.972
What do I tell Internal Affairs?

35:54.047 --> 35:56.538
Truth can't hurt, Deeks.

35:56.716 --> 35:57.740
She's dead.

36:03.022 --> 36:04.046
Right.

36:08.128 --> 36:11.791
- I trusted her.
- We all trusted her.

36:15.702 --> 36:17.795
She told me this story one time.

36:18.004 --> 36:21.599
Showed me this photo, her on the left.
The other girl's her cousin. Christina.

36:22.609 --> 36:24.770
They were walking home one night
and this van pulls up

36:24.944 --> 36:27.742
and these two guys jump out
and they try to abduct them.

36:27.914 --> 36:30.439
Traynor, she gets away.
But her cousin, she's, uh...

36:31.818 --> 36:33.115
Not so lucky.

36:35.288 --> 36:38.223
They find her body down
in Mexico 18 months later.

36:41.060 --> 36:42.584
Human traffickers, right?

36:45.131 --> 36:47.258
So I keep asking myself, you know?

36:47.433 --> 36:50.061
I said, with a history like that,
how she could be in business

36:50.236 --> 36:52.466
with a scumbag like Emilio Ortega?

36:53.239 --> 36:55.639
And that's when I realized...

36:57.143 --> 36:58.940
She wasn't.

37:00.246 --> 37:01.611
Frank.

37:02.415 --> 37:05.475
She was just trying
to figure out who was.

37:06.853 --> 37:08.946
So while I'm busy out there
trying to catch Lazik,

37:09.122 --> 37:10.680
she's trying to win Emilio's trust

37:10.857 --> 37:14.554
so that he's going to tell her
who it is that he was really paying off.

37:18.131 --> 37:19.598
That would be you.

37:23.469 --> 37:26.700
If Lazik hadn't killed them,

37:27.373 --> 37:28.431
I would have.

37:29.509 --> 37:31.636
I'm sorry, Deeks.

37:35.648 --> 37:36.876
No, you're not.

37:37.116 --> 37:38.879
Lower your weapon.

37:47.227 --> 37:49.718
- Did you get all that?
- Every word of it.

37:53.700 --> 37:55.691
So tell me, Deeks.

37:55.902 --> 37:58.336
How was she in bed, huh?

37:59.672 --> 38:01.003
What did you say?

38:02.141 --> 38:03.665
Ask me again.

38:05.311 --> 38:08.144
- Ask me again.
- Deeks.

38:08.314 --> 38:09.474
He's not worth it.

38:10.049 --> 38:11.516
Ask me again.

38:14.621 --> 38:16.179
Ask it again!

38:18.124 --> 38:19.921
Deeks, put it down.

38:20.727 --> 38:21.751
Deeks...

38:44.350 --> 38:45.374
You saw that.

38:46.753 --> 38:48.050
You all saw that.

38:48.254 --> 38:50.688
I didn't see a thing.
You see anything, Sam?

38:50.890 --> 38:52.016
Not a thing.

39:09.275 --> 39:10.572
Nate.

39:13.413 --> 39:16.576
- You called?
- Pack a bag and your passport.

39:17.417 --> 39:18.748
I'm sorry?

39:19.485 --> 39:20.679
You're needed.

39:20.887 --> 39:22.582
Ha, ha. Needed where?

39:22.789 --> 39:24.882
You'll find out when you get there.

39:25.091 --> 39:28.822
There's a C-117 leaving
in 90 minutes.

39:28.995 --> 39:30.758
Transport's outside.

39:31.331 --> 39:34.767
- But I, uh...
- You did say you had no plans.

39:38.838 --> 39:40.328
Go.

39:41.307 --> 39:42.831
Going.

40:07.133 --> 40:08.600
Hey.

40:55.314 --> 40:57.874
Did you catch him this time?

40:59.819 --> 41:02.811
- Maybe I'll never catch him.
- Maybe you don't want to.

41:06.059 --> 41:08.653
- What's this?
- It's a contract.

41:08.828 --> 41:10.090
You're buying a house.

41:10.563 --> 41:14.431
I negotiated a very good price
on your behalf.

41:14.667 --> 41:16.362
No loan required.

41:16.536 --> 41:20.028
You really do live very frugally,
Mr. Callen.

41:20.239 --> 41:24.767
I had a friend look over the contract.
It cost me a bottle of Grange.

41:24.944 --> 41:28.539
Consider it my housewarming gift.

41:28.748 --> 41:30.215
All you have to do is sign it.

41:30.850 --> 41:32.875
- Hetty...
- It's a deceased estate.

41:33.086 --> 41:36.214
Vacant possession.
You can move in tomorrow.

41:36.389 --> 41:37.913
Hetty.

41:38.624 --> 41:39.682
I don't need a house.

41:41.627 --> 41:47.532
I think you'll like the neighborhood,
Mr. Callen.

42:06.752 --> 42:08.481
The realtor has the key.

42:10.857 --> 42:12.415
I've already got one.
