00:00.898 --> 00:03.500
<i>Westport Unified
has its cliques, for sure.</i>

00:03.601 --> 00:04.726
<i>I'm not talking about the kids.</i>

00:04.795 --> 00:06.528
<i>I'm talking about the parents.</i>

00:06.596 --> 00:08.397
<i>These are the sports boosters.</i>

00:08.465 --> 00:11.618
<i>Their main concern is that
our team wins State every year.</i>

00:11.845 --> 00:13.782
<i>What we lack in homegrown athleticism,</i>

00:13.821 --> 00:15.704
<i>we make up for in foreign adoptions.</i>

00:15.773 --> 00:17.406
Good grab, son!

00:17.474 --> 00:19.141
<i>Then you have The Arts parents...</i>

00:19.209 --> 00:21.209
<i>Sad losers living out
their broken dreams</i>

00:21.278 --> 00:23.612
<i>through their children's
cloying performance of "Rent."</i>

00:23.680 --> 00:26.681
<i>The techies want everything at
school to be state-of-the-art...</i>

00:26.750 --> 00:29.017
<i>iPads, smartphones. I think half of them</i>

00:29.086 --> 00:31.060
<i>would upgrade their kids
to robots if they could.</i>

00:31.255 --> 00:32.988
<i>A robot kid wouldn't be so bad.</i>

00:33.056 --> 00:35.357
<i>The Asians are all about academics,</i>

00:35.426 --> 00:37.225
<i>and... well, academics.</i>

00:37.294 --> 00:39.594
<i>Here's Anna-Kat's special needs
teacher, Dr. Ellie,</i>

00:39.663 --> 00:41.430
<i>the only reason
we're at this clique-y school</i>

00:41.498 --> 00:42.998
<i>in this clique-y town to begin with.</i>

00:43.066 --> 00:45.167
Oh, Katie, have you seen the new budget

00:45.235 --> 00:46.468
the PTA just approved?

00:46.537 --> 00:48.804
The PTA involves associating
with parents and teachers,

00:48.872 --> 00:49.938
so no.

00:50.007 --> 00:51.706
They're taking the money
for special needs

00:51.775 --> 00:53.775
and putting it towards
new lights in the parking lot!

00:53.844 --> 00:55.944
What? What are you saying?

00:56.013 --> 00:58.246
I won't be working at Westport
Unified next semester.

00:58.315 --> 01:00.182
But, Dr. Ellie, you are the only reason

01:00.250 --> 01:03.785
we moved to this beautiful idyllic.
picture-perfect hellhole.

01:15.065 --> 01:17.499
Greg, we cannot lose Dr. Ellie!

01:17.568 --> 01:20.135
Look, we can't be the only
parents upset about this.

01:20.204 --> 01:21.467
What about the other families
who see her?

01:21.529 --> 01:23.912
I've already reached out.
Half of them will hire her as a tutor.

01:23.983 --> 01:25.474
The rest will switch to private school.

01:25.542 --> 01:27.309
Why couldn't we have been born rich

01:27.377 --> 01:30.312
or chosen better jobs
or just... worked harder?

01:30.380 --> 01:31.680
Well, there's a PTA meeting tonight.

01:31.748 --> 01:33.982
One of us should go and
convince them to amend the budget

01:34.051 --> 01:35.211
to secure Dr. Ellie's funding.

01:35.252 --> 01:36.560
That sentence alone

01:36.646 --> 01:38.333
is why you are the parent
who should go tonight,

01:38.411 --> 01:39.421
and I should stay home

01:39.490 --> 01:41.370
and send you encouraging texts
from the bathtub.

01:41.425 --> 01:43.158
Well, I certainly know school politics,

01:43.227 --> 01:44.779
but I don't know the personalities.

01:44.842 --> 01:45.827
Well, I can't go.

01:45.896 --> 01:48.163
I hate all those
over-involved idiots on the PTA.

01:48.232 --> 01:49.664
"Our chalkboard is old!"

01:49.733 --> 01:52.067
"Is our mascot racially insensitive?"

01:52.135 --> 01:53.935
Ugh. Enough already.

01:57.107 --> 01:59.841
Mama, I can't stop thinking
about Baby Jessica.

01:59.910 --> 02:00.809
Okay, honey.

02:00.878 --> 02:02.043
Let's calm down.

02:02.112 --> 02:04.546
Say it just like Dr. Ellie taught you.

02:04.615 --> 02:05.647
Okay, I'll try.

02:05.716 --> 02:09.184
I am not a baby.
We do not have a well in our yard.

02:09.252 --> 02:12.521
The fire department will not
have to come and rescue me

02:12.589 --> 02:14.389
and tape my arm to my head.

02:14.458 --> 02:16.758
Oh, God. We need Dr. Ellie.

02:16.827 --> 02:18.960
We're gonna have to become
over-involved idiots.

02:21.164 --> 02:22.731
Okay. Keep the doors locked,

02:22.799 --> 02:24.466
don't use the oven, stove, or microwave,

02:24.535 --> 02:26.334
text me every hour
to say that you're alive,

02:26.403 --> 02:27.836
and stay out of my nightstand.

02:27.905 --> 02:29.504
- You've been warned.
- Don't worry, Mom.

02:29.573 --> 02:30.772
I got this.

02:30.841 --> 02:33.108
I think Taylor's gonna do
a fantastic job.

02:33.176 --> 02:35.377
Your positivity is highly suspect.

02:35.445 --> 02:36.645
Are you okay with this?

02:36.713 --> 02:38.046
As long as they play with me.

02:38.115 --> 02:39.648
- I can't wait.
- Of course we will!

02:39.716 --> 02:42.026
You mess this up, and I'll make
sure to haunt you when I die.

02:42.065 --> 02:43.718
Not just the chains and moaning.

02:43.787 --> 02:45.921
The dark stuff.

02:47.691 --> 02:49.691
- Why are you wearing a sports coat?
- We're going out.

02:49.760 --> 02:52.427
To a PTA meeting... in the cafeteria.

02:52.496 --> 02:54.362
Going out is going out.
I want to look nice.

02:54.431 --> 02:55.630
But you look fine.

02:56.800 --> 02:58.040
Should have said nothing, Greg.

02:59.736 --> 03:02.103
Okay, kids, be good, play together,

03:02.172 --> 03:03.972
and don't be stupid.

03:08.946 --> 03:10.011
Yes!

03:10.080 --> 03:11.976
This is amazing. We're home alone.

03:12.030 --> 03:13.315
You're the only responsible adult,

03:13.383 --> 03:14.849
- and you're ridiculous.
- I know!

03:14.918 --> 03:16.184
I'm not responsible at all!

03:17.154 --> 03:18.453
You know what we should do?

03:18.522 --> 03:19.454
Watch "Death Coat."

03:19.523 --> 03:20.789
What's a Death Coat?

03:20.857 --> 03:22.257
It's a movie about this coat,

03:22.326 --> 03:24.526
and if you put it on,
you become a psychotic killer.

03:24.595 --> 03:25.961
It's so scary

03:26.029 --> 03:27.729
that a girl in Seattle
died while watching it.

03:27.800 --> 03:28.797
It's true.

03:28.865 --> 03:30.632
Yeah, but you believed
"The Hunger Games" was real

03:30.701 --> 03:32.200
and happening in Russia.

03:32.269 --> 03:33.401
You're an unreliable source.

03:33.470 --> 03:35.136
You can't watch a movie tonight.

03:35.205 --> 03:36.705
You promised you would play with me.

03:36.773 --> 03:37.773
We will.

03:37.808 --> 03:39.541
But first, why don't you run upstairs,

03:39.610 --> 03:40.742
get all your toys ready,

03:40.811 --> 03:41.977
make sure it's all clean?

03:42.045 --> 03:44.027
And then double-check
that it's super clean.

03:44.113 --> 03:45.814
- And then...
- You can't trick me.

03:45.882 --> 03:46.915
I'm smarter than you.

03:46.984 --> 03:49.657
Now, upstairs. Ponies.

03:49.750 --> 03:51.289
- How about I take you...
- Ponies.

03:51.375 --> 03:53.722
- But what if I...
- Ponies!

03:53.790 --> 03:55.991
She really is Mom's daughter.
It's unsettling.

03:59.963 --> 04:01.429
Okay, there they are...

04:01.498 --> 04:03.198
The power cartels of the PTA.

04:03.266 --> 04:04.399
They run this school.

04:04.468 --> 04:06.234
We got to go in
first-day-of-prison tough.

04:06.303 --> 04:08.403
Find the biggest one
and punch him in the face.

04:08.472 --> 04:10.372
Easy, now. This is school politics.

04:10.440 --> 04:12.340
There's an art to it.
You can't be so pushy.

04:12.409 --> 04:15.543
Greg, my two defining qualities
are pushy and tired,

04:15.612 --> 04:17.846
and I don't think tired
is gonna get our teacher back.

04:17.914 --> 04:19.047
During new business,

04:19.116 --> 04:20.613
we'll make an impassioned
plea for Dr. Ellie

04:20.676 --> 04:22.751
and how important she is
in shaping our daughter's life.

04:22.819 --> 04:24.543
People take me seriously,
and do you know why?

04:24.645 --> 04:26.888
- Go ahead.
- Because I dressed business casual.

04:26.957 --> 04:29.557
Please, everyone, take a seat.

04:36.333 --> 04:37.933
When do we handle new business?

04:37.968 --> 04:39.734
We have a huge, very important issue.

04:39.803 --> 04:41.269
It's at the end of the meeting.

04:41.338 --> 04:42.338
Why is it at the end?

04:42.406 --> 04:43.705
That is 45 minutes

04:43.774 --> 04:45.021
where I could be watching
"90 Day FiancÃ©."

04:45.084 --> 04:47.075
- I know.
- Settle, everyone.

04:47.144 --> 04:49.077
Before we get going,
I have an announcement.

04:49.146 --> 04:51.446
Phyllis has given up
her seat on the board.

04:51.515 --> 04:54.582
She's going away for a few weeks
to treat her exhaustion.

04:54.651 --> 04:57.152
Exhausted from drinking so much.
Poor thing.

04:57.220 --> 05:02.290
So, for our first matter of business,
I would like to call for nominations

05:02.359 --> 05:03.359
for a new board member.

05:04.561 --> 05:06.428
New plan... power grab.

05:06.496 --> 05:10.532
Remember, you cannot nominate
yourself or your spouse.

05:10.600 --> 05:11.600
Damn it.

05:11.635 --> 05:13.868
Nominate me.

05:13.937 --> 05:16.404
I nominate Greg Otto.

05:16.473 --> 05:17.473
Oh! My.

05:17.507 --> 05:18.740
Well.

05:18.809 --> 05:20.175
I really like his jacket.

05:20.243 --> 05:22.177
Doris, why not me?

05:22.245 --> 05:23.978
You are wildly disliked.

05:24.681 --> 05:26.147
I, um, I nominate...

05:26.216 --> 05:28.104
Sit down, Randy.

05:28.351 --> 05:29.818
- Yep.
- Very good.

05:29.886 --> 05:31.953
All those in favor of
electing Greg Otto,

05:32.022 --> 05:33.455
say "Aye."

05:33.523 --> 05:34.563
"Aye."

05:34.591 --> 05:36.357
All opposed, say "Nay."

05:39.429 --> 05:40.462
The "Ayes" have it.

05:40.530 --> 05:41.796
Congratulations, Mr. Otto.

05:41.865 --> 05:43.298
Welcome to the PTA.

05:46.169 --> 05:47.635
Oh!

05:47.704 --> 05:49.404
We have a seat on the board.

05:49.506 --> 05:51.209
We can work the system from the inside.

05:51.311 --> 05:52.474
You be the face, I'll be the brains,

05:52.542 --> 05:54.676
and together, we'll bring
this school to its knees.

05:54.745 --> 05:56.010
We're just trying to secure funding

05:56.079 --> 05:57.245
for Anna-Kat's special ed teacher.

05:57.314 --> 05:58.713
To its knees.

05:59.416 --> 06:00.416
To its knees.

06:06.397 --> 06:08.198
So, to keep Dr. Ellie at school,

06:08.284 --> 06:10.658
we need three of the five
board members on our side.

06:10.727 --> 06:12.360
With your vote, we just need two.

06:13.630 --> 06:14.829
That's the picture you chose?

06:14.898 --> 06:16.064
What's wrong with it?

06:16.132 --> 06:17.031
- We look great.
- You look great.

06:17.100 --> 06:18.300
I'm in the middle of a sneeze.

06:18.335 --> 06:19.968
Greg, I always look great in pictures.

06:20.036 --> 06:21.869
It's not my fault. Focus up.

06:21.938 --> 06:23.338
Here are the players.

06:23.406 --> 06:26.207
Bruce, Jenn, Kyoko,
and Crossing Guard Sandy.

06:26.276 --> 06:27.475
Mm, Crossing Guard Sandy's

06:27.544 --> 06:29.244
the one who re-appropriated
Dr. Ellie's funding.

06:29.312 --> 06:30.545
- We'll never get her vote.
- Yes.

06:30.614 --> 06:32.981
Plus, we've had our differences.

06:33.049 --> 06:35.750
A complete stop is a complete stop!

06:35.819 --> 06:37.979
I would love for your mouth
to come to a complete stop!

06:38.788 --> 06:40.121
I'll kill you!

06:40.190 --> 06:41.923
Don't touch my sign!

06:41.992 --> 06:45.360
So, at the PTA mixer tonight,

06:45.428 --> 06:48.863
- we need to win these three over.
- Got it.

06:48.932 --> 06:50.312
You bought a new poster board for this?

06:50.384 --> 06:52.567
No! It's was Taylor's vision board.

06:52.636 --> 06:53.701
It was empty.

06:53.770 --> 06:54.770
So...

06:55.839 --> 06:57.238
- Yeah. Sure enough.
- Yeah.

06:57.307 --> 06:58.373
Yeah.

06:58.441 --> 06:59.807
Okay.

06:59.876 --> 07:01.542
We have another school event to go to.

07:01.611 --> 07:02.543
Mom, what's going on?

07:02.612 --> 07:05.113
You hate being involved.
You always say being involved

07:05.181 --> 07:07.315
is for busybodies
and people with dead marriages.

07:07.384 --> 07:08.616
This is for Anna-Kat.

07:08.685 --> 07:09.717
- Oh.
- Oh.

07:11.588 --> 07:12.720
Okay.

07:12.789 --> 07:14.656
Nobody died last night
and nothing burned down.

07:14.724 --> 07:15.990
It's a low bar, but you cleared it.

07:16.059 --> 07:18.187
Do that again.
And don't eat my good almonds.

07:18.228 --> 07:19.827
You've been warned.

07:21.765 --> 07:23.164
You're on the board now,

07:23.233 --> 07:25.961
so you need to work the room and
make friends with the other voters.

07:26.603 --> 07:28.603
There's Bruce. Let's schmooze. Brief me.

07:28.672 --> 07:30.272
He's a hothead who's in anger management

07:30.307 --> 07:31.439
for slashing a ref's tires.

07:31.508 --> 07:32.908
His wife Gina frenched Angela once,

07:32.976 --> 07:34.475
- but that's a secret.
- Bruce.

07:34.544 --> 07:35.743
Greg Otto.

07:35.812 --> 07:37.372
You see that botched call this weekend?

07:37.414 --> 07:38.880
- Terrible!
- Terrible!

07:38.948 --> 07:41.349
And, Gina, that is
a smart, tight haircut.

07:41.374 --> 07:42.940
Did I ever tell you
that I have a vast collection

07:42.965 --> 07:44.005
of oversized belt buckles?

07:44.754 --> 07:46.321
I'll catch you guys later.

07:46.389 --> 07:49.624
Wow! You're amazing at this.

07:49.693 --> 07:51.492
Eh, I'm only as good as my intel.

07:51.561 --> 07:52.994
We're like a power couple.

07:53.063 --> 07:54.099
There's Jenn. Hit me.

07:54.162 --> 07:55.797
She loves attention.
Her nickname's "The Prowler"

07:55.865 --> 07:57.705
because she's always
hitting on dads at school.

07:58.935 --> 07:59.935
Hang back.

08:01.104 --> 08:02.270
Why, hello.

08:02.339 --> 08:03.771
Oh.

08:03.840 --> 08:05.340
I didn't know they let students
into these meetings.

08:05.408 --> 08:06.708
Greg Otto.

08:09.045 --> 08:12.013
<i>Yeah, there you go, Greg.
Shake those hips, get that vote.</i>

08:12.082 --> 08:13.611
Great news.

08:13.681 --> 08:16.084
Kyoko and the Asians are
gonna vote for your budget!

08:16.152 --> 08:17.314
Yes!

08:17.384 --> 08:18.386
What made them support us?

08:18.455 --> 08:21.122
They love how mean you are
to the white women.

08:21.191 --> 08:22.490
Okay.

08:22.559 --> 08:24.525
We just need one more vote.

08:25.895 --> 08:27.862
- Did he just push her?
- Yeah.

08:27.931 --> 08:30.298
His moves haven't really changed
since grade school.

08:32.000 --> 08:38.073

08:39.035 --> 08:43.177
<i>Grandma, it's chilly in here.
Let me grab you a coat.</i>

08:45.982 --> 08:46.982
<i>Hmm.</i>

09:00.096 --> 09:01.429
<i>Grandma!</i>

09:03.199 --> 09:04.199
Five minutes in,

09:04.267 --> 09:06.100
you're already screaming like a girl.

09:06.169 --> 09:07.268
That wasn't me.

09:08.772 --> 09:09.904
What are you doing here?

09:09.973 --> 09:11.272
You're supposed to be in bed!

09:11.341 --> 09:13.341
I'm never putting on a coat again!

09:15.779 --> 09:17.972
Looks like another night
of playing ponies.

09:18.026 --> 09:19.222
I call Buttercup!

09:22.185 --> 09:23.918
Wow. Look at you.

09:23.987 --> 09:26.320
The only woman in this room, probably
in town, with a beer in her hand.

09:26.389 --> 09:28.186
I drink it out of a bottle just to enjoy

09:28.247 --> 09:30.005
- the look of horror on their faces.
- Yeah.

09:30.006 --> 09:31.793
You know Tanya wanted
to make this a wine-only event.

09:31.861 --> 09:32.927
- She's the worst.
- Mm.

09:32.996 --> 09:34.595
Or, wait, you're probably
friends with her.

09:34.664 --> 09:36.063
Are you kidding me?

09:36.132 --> 09:38.599
I once slipped her a peanut
to prove that her "allergy"

09:38.668 --> 09:39.801
was just a ploy to get attention.

09:39.869 --> 09:41.002
Total fake allergy.

09:41.070 --> 09:42.403
- Well...
- Really?

09:42.472 --> 09:43.805
Oh, that is awesome!

09:43.873 --> 09:45.139
Hey, can I talk to you about

09:45.208 --> 09:46.707
our school's special needs teacher?

09:46.776 --> 09:47.776
Uh, sure.

09:47.844 --> 09:49.110
Let's go grab a beer
at The Black Mallard

09:49.179 --> 09:50.278
and catch the second half of the game.

09:50.346 --> 09:51.479
They have free popcorn.

09:51.548 --> 09:52.680
It's gone tons of germs,
but I don't really care.

09:52.749 --> 09:54.348
- Great!
- All right.

09:56.419 --> 09:57.619
Can I borrow him for a minute?

09:57.687 --> 10:00.254
Okay, but you have to give him back.

10:05.762 --> 10:07.295
We got to go grab a drink with Bruce.

10:07.363 --> 10:08.563
I'm pretty sure I can get his vote.

10:08.631 --> 10:10.064
Well, we can't leave now.
I'm talking up Dr. Ellie.

10:10.133 --> 10:11.466
I think I can close the deal with Jenn.

10:11.534 --> 10:13.174
Greg, anyone can close the deal
with Jenn.

10:13.236 --> 10:15.154
How about this?
You get The Prowler's vote.

10:15.179 --> 10:16.114
I'll get Bruce's vote.

10:16.139 --> 10:18.139
Them, plus the Asians, plus you.
That's four votes!

10:18.174 --> 10:21.375
That'll just really stick it
to that Crossing Guard Sandy.

10:21.444 --> 10:23.945
Ugh. Look at her.

10:24.013 --> 10:25.780
It was great to see you.

10:26.683 --> 10:28.282
That woman's the worst.

10:31.287 --> 10:33.087
Dr. Ellie has written articles on OCD

10:33.156 --> 10:34.755
and spoken at several conferences.

10:34.824 --> 10:35.824
And to lose her...

10:35.859 --> 10:36.924
Attaway, boys! Yes!

10:38.294 --> 10:40.027
Wait. UNC just scored?

10:40.096 --> 10:41.963
Oh, yeah. I'm UNC, baby.

10:42.031 --> 10:43.364
All the way. Look at that.

10:43.433 --> 10:44.665
Duke can suck it.

10:46.169 --> 10:48.503
<i>Katie, it's just a college rivalry.</i>

10:48.571 --> 10:51.305
<i>It doesn't matter that you're
a third-generation Duke alumna</i>

10:51.374 --> 10:52.673
<i>or that you met Greg there</i>

10:52.742 --> 10:54.642
<i>or that Oliver's middle name is Duke.</i>

10:54.711 --> 10:56.511
The reason I bring up Dr. Ellie...

10:56.579 --> 10:59.279
I can't believe Duke's actually
still a Division 1 school

10:59.334 --> 11:00.983
and not a junior college.
You know what I mean?

11:01.050 --> 11:02.884
I don't.

11:06.122 --> 11:07.855
You have such a resonant voice.

11:08.992 --> 11:12.026
Oh! You would make an amazing
Jean Valjean.

11:12.095 --> 11:13.494
I've always thought so.

11:13.563 --> 11:16.898
But a string a community theatre
directors have disagreed.

11:16.966 --> 11:19.568
Not to mix business with pleasure,
but I have a PTA issue.

11:19.636 --> 11:21.802
Oh! Me, too!

11:21.871 --> 11:23.704
I'll tell you mine if you tell me yours.

11:25.909 --> 11:26.941
I am hoping to put

11:27.010 --> 11:28.476
healthy vending machines at the school,

11:28.545 --> 11:32.046
and all the money raised
will go to the arts program.

11:32.115 --> 11:33.714
I would love if you would promise

11:33.783 --> 11:34.849
to give me your vote.

11:34.918 --> 11:36.250
I'm happy to pledge my support.

11:36.319 --> 11:37.418
Pledging now. Pledging.

11:37.487 --> 11:38.319
Mm!

11:38.388 --> 11:40.321
And break!

11:40.390 --> 11:41.390
Go team!

11:43.793 --> 11:45.560
Your mascot is literally a devil.

11:45.628 --> 11:48.496
And a Tar Heel is better?
What the hell is a Tar Heel, Bruce?

11:48.565 --> 11:50.531
I Googled it once! No one knows!

11:50.600 --> 11:52.867
it's a heel covered in tar
that goes up Duke's ass!

11:52.936 --> 11:54.468
Oh! Okay.

11:54.537 --> 11:56.671
I'ma flip a table!

11:58.775 --> 12:00.775
Oh. Okay. Real classy.

12:00.843 --> 12:03.444
I'm never voting for
your dumb doctor now!

12:03.513 --> 12:05.446
Guess what? I don't need your vote.

12:05.515 --> 12:07.882
My husband's knuckle-deep
in a vote right now!

12:07.951 --> 12:08.849
Mmm!

12:08.918 --> 12:11.052
Ooh, this merlot is wonderful!

12:11.120 --> 12:12.853
I love how nutty it is.

12:12.922 --> 12:14.021
Just like you.

12:16.292 --> 12:17.892
- You know what else is nutty?
- Hmm.

12:17.961 --> 12:19.527
Crossing Guard Sandy's new budget.

12:19.596 --> 12:22.463
If I put forth a new one
to save Dr. Ellie,

12:22.532 --> 12:24.098
could I count on your support?

12:24.167 --> 12:26.367
Oh. No.

12:26.436 --> 12:29.070
But I agreed to vote
for your vending machines,

12:29.138 --> 12:30.671
and we're getting along.

12:30.740 --> 12:32.780
And you invaded my safe-space
on numerous occasions.

12:32.809 --> 12:34.842
I'm sorry. Crossing Guard Sandy and I

12:34.911 --> 12:36.711
have already agreed to vote
for each other's proposals.

12:36.779 --> 12:38.846
But...

12:38.915 --> 12:42.984
If there is something that
you would like to propose...

12:44.187 --> 12:46.887
- I'd like to propose a toast.
- Oh?

12:46.956 --> 12:48.789
To the security cameras of this bar.

12:48.858 --> 12:51.769
May they show that I did not
initiate this contact.

12:52.399 --> 12:53.432
I love coats!

12:53.457 --> 12:56.558
- Purple coats, blue coats!
- And pink!

12:56.652 --> 12:57.777
Coats are our friends!

12:58.985 --> 13:00.084
- Oh, my...
- Hey, guys.

13:00.153 --> 13:02.186
Why is Anna-Kat still awake?

13:02.255 --> 13:03.354
Mama!

13:03.423 --> 13:05.556
Take off your coat before it kills you!

13:05.625 --> 13:07.191
What is she talking about?

13:07.260 --> 13:09.180
It's unrelated to anything
that happened tonight,

13:09.228 --> 13:11.595
- I can tell you that much.
- I'll take her to bed.

13:11.664 --> 13:14.031
Honey, go upstairs
and do your finger exercises.

13:14.100 --> 13:16.434
Mama will be up in a few minutes
to tuck you in.

13:20.506 --> 13:25.076
So, now she's afraid of coats, wells,
and mannequins with no clothes.

13:25.144 --> 13:27.011
But we'll do fine
without Dr. Ellie next year.

13:28.448 --> 13:29.613
It's Doris. Hey, what's up?

13:31.017 --> 13:32.249
Did you promise Jenn

13:32.318 --> 13:34.351
you'd vote for vending machines
in the school?

13:34.420 --> 13:35.920
- Yeah, healthy vending machines.
- Yeah, he did.

13:35.988 --> 13:37.755
What?

13:37.824 --> 13:39.690
Oh, no. Bye.

13:41.027 --> 13:44.495
Kyoko and the Asians
hate vending machines.

13:44.564 --> 13:46.097
- Why?
- Does it matter?

13:46.165 --> 13:48.655
We lost the Asians!
You just lost us Dr. Ellie!

13:48.748 --> 13:51.068
How could you give Jenn your vote
without getting hers in return?

13:51.137 --> 13:52.169
You're a total pushover!

13:52.238 --> 13:53.904
Yeah, well... You're a bully!

13:53.973 --> 13:56.340
- Oh, really, Greg?
- Yeah, and why is this all on me?

13:56.409 --> 13:59.343
You lost Bruce's vote
because you are a bully.

13:59.412 --> 14:01.345
You couldn't even land The Prowler.

14:01.414 --> 14:02.446
You flipped a table.

14:02.515 --> 14:04.081
I'ma flip a table right now!

14:04.150 --> 14:05.430
It is too late to start a fight.

14:07.153 --> 14:08.819
Yeah, it is.

14:12.058 --> 14:14.425
<i>Anybody whoever said
"Don't go to bed angry"</i>

14:14.494 --> 14:16.157
<i>doesn't have three kids.</i>

14:16.251 --> 14:19.118
<i>When I have a chance to sleep,
I'm gonna sleep.</i>

14:22.401 --> 14:23.667
Shh!

14:30.195 --> 14:32.195
This is the worst.

14:32.264 --> 14:34.331
I'm up to my armpits in school politics,

14:34.400 --> 14:35.866
Greg and I still aren't speaking,

14:35.934 --> 14:37.501
and Anna-Kat is not going to have

14:37.569 --> 14:38.835
a special ed class next year.

14:38.904 --> 14:39.904
That's it.

14:39.972 --> 14:42.305
We're getting table pancakes.

14:42.374 --> 14:43.740
Look, Katie, the vote
hasn't happened yet.

14:43.809 --> 14:45.842
I know Kyoko's upset,
but I think you can win her back.

14:45.911 --> 14:48.627
Mnh-mnh. That's only two votes.
I still need Bruce or Jenn.

14:48.697 --> 14:50.063
Or Crossing Guard Sandy.

14:51.066 --> 14:52.432
I told you not to park in the yellow!

14:52.501 --> 14:54.301
You tell me a lot of
stupid stuff I ignore!

14:55.604 --> 14:57.170
That was my grandmother's!

14:57.239 --> 14:59.372
Wait, your grandmother
was a crossing guard?

14:59.441 --> 15:01.708
You'll see my grandmother in Hell!

15:01.777 --> 15:02.777
Aah!

15:04.346 --> 15:05.879
Not Sandy.

15:05.948 --> 15:07.668
Maybe I can blackmail Bruce
to get his vote.

15:07.716 --> 15:10.036
Angela, do you have any pictures
of you frenching his wife?

15:10.786 --> 15:11.786
Not his wife.

15:11.820 --> 15:13.954
Then I'm out of options.

15:14.022 --> 15:15.522
I'd say I'd home-school Anna-Kat,

15:15.591 --> 15:17.657
but I'm not going to
because who wants to do that?

15:17.726 --> 15:20.454
Look, Katie, you and Greg
are like my breakfast.

15:20.479 --> 15:23.497
Greg is like my eggs...
solid, dependable,

15:23.565 --> 15:25.065
But on their own, no, thank you.

15:25.134 --> 15:26.299
- That's true.
- That's true?

15:26.368 --> 15:28.101
I don't know. I'm supporting her.

15:28.170 --> 15:30.303
And you, Katie, are like hot sauce...

15:30.372 --> 15:32.672
fierce, wild,
and a little goes a long way.

15:32.741 --> 15:34.608
But together...

15:34.676 --> 15:36.775
Mmm! Perfect!

15:38.914 --> 15:40.572
Way too much hot sauce.

15:40.749 --> 15:41.749
It's burning my teeth.

15:42.351 --> 15:44.252
- I don't want to get new teeth again.
- Okay.

15:47.789 --> 15:49.823
- Fight's over.
- What?

15:51.560 --> 15:52.826
Fight's over.

15:52.895 --> 15:54.861
How come you get to decide
when a fight's over?

15:54.930 --> 15:56.530
That's just how it is.
I don't make the rules.

15:56.598 --> 15:58.165
Yes, you do.

15:58.233 --> 16:00.033
Greg, if we are going to
make this happen,

16:00.102 --> 16:01.134
we have to work together.

16:03.539 --> 16:04.838
You're right.

16:04.907 --> 16:06.339
Next meeting,
we'll both get those votes.

16:07.876 --> 16:09.409
Remember how we used to get excited

16:09.478 --> 16:10.593
about much better things?

16:11.480 --> 16:12.512
Kind of.

16:15.450 --> 16:16.450
Okay.

16:16.518 --> 16:17.817
Four PTA members,

16:17.886 --> 16:19.048
and all we need is two of them.

16:19.126 --> 16:20.720
There's Jenn.

16:20.789 --> 16:21.821
Got your back.

16:21.890 --> 16:23.123
Go do your thing.

16:23.192 --> 16:24.324
Excuse me, Jenn.

16:24.393 --> 16:26.667
- A word with you about the...
- Here's the deal.

16:26.762 --> 16:28.659
If you don't vote for Dr. Ellie,

16:28.745 --> 16:31.264
then you can forget our support
for your stupid healthy vending machine.

16:33.035 --> 16:34.567
Greg, you promised.

16:35.771 --> 16:38.138
I put my finger in your mouth.

16:40.542 --> 16:41.542
Uh...

16:41.576 --> 16:43.510
I'm cool.

16:45.013 --> 16:47.547
Vending machines are dead.

16:47.616 --> 16:49.749
- Can we count on your vote?
- Yes.

16:49.818 --> 16:51.184
As long as vending machines

16:51.253 --> 16:53.153
- are never allowed in our school.
- Agreed.

16:53.221 --> 16:55.461
But I can ask what your problem
with vending machines is?

16:55.490 --> 16:57.123
No.

16:59.895 --> 17:00.727
Okay.

17:00.796 --> 17:02.195
We just need one more vote.

17:10.638 --> 17:12.872
- Well, the Bruce bridge is burned.
- Mm.

17:12.941 --> 17:15.008
That means there's only one vote left.

17:20.582 --> 17:22.082
Hey.

17:22.150 --> 17:23.849
Sandy.

17:23.919 --> 17:28.088
I get asking you for help is weird.

17:28.204 --> 17:29.856
We haven't always been BFFs.

17:29.925 --> 17:32.392
You tried to broadside me with your car.

17:32.461 --> 17:35.128
Sandy, if I was trying,
I would have hit you.

17:35.197 --> 17:36.062
You're right, Sandy.

17:36.131 --> 17:37.397
You've done nothing wrong.

17:37.466 --> 17:38.898
Just like Anna-Kat has done
nothing wrong to deserve

17:38.967 --> 17:41.034
losing her highly trained
and wonderful teacher.

17:41.103 --> 17:42.402
You should be on our side.

17:42.471 --> 17:43.503
Growing up,

17:43.572 --> 17:45.004
I'm sure you were in
a special needs class.

17:45.073 --> 17:46.740
No, I wasn't!

17:46.808 --> 17:47.808
Really?

17:47.843 --> 17:49.242
While I appreciate that

17:49.311 --> 17:50.677
new lights in the parking lot
are important,

17:50.746 --> 17:52.545
Dr. Ellie is transforming
our daughter's life.

17:52.614 --> 17:55.415
But Dr. Ellie is only helping
the special needs kids.

17:55.484 --> 17:57.550
My parking lot lights are for everyone.

17:57.619 --> 17:58.782
And I hate your wife.

17:59.314 --> 18:01.287
I mean, I really hate her.

18:01.356 --> 18:02.956
No chance in hell
you're getting my vote.

18:03.992 --> 18:04.858
Ever.

18:08.530 --> 18:10.997
I'm never going to sleep again.

18:11.643 --> 18:12.775
Me, neither.

18:13.048 --> 18:14.768
How could I have let us watch
that movie?

18:14.836 --> 18:17.137
I shouldn't be in charge of minors.

18:17.205 --> 18:19.005
How are we gonna get over this?

18:23.111 --> 18:25.011
Anna-Kat. Anna-Kat.

18:25.080 --> 18:26.880
What?

18:26.948 --> 18:29.282
We need to know how to make
our brains right again.

18:33.155 --> 18:37.123
Next up, the vote
on Greg Otto's amended budget

18:37.192 --> 18:39.259
to reinstate Dr. Ellie.

18:39.327 --> 18:41.127
I vote yes.

18:41.196 --> 18:42.962
Yes.

18:43.031 --> 18:44.664
No.

18:44.733 --> 18:45.899
Not a chance in hell.

18:47.135 --> 18:49.569
And I vote...

18:49.638 --> 18:50.570
Yes.

18:52.407 --> 18:53.807
That's three votes.

18:53.875 --> 18:55.115
Budget passes.

18:55.977 --> 18:57.410
How the hell did you do that?

19:02.684 --> 19:03.783
You better get ready

19:03.852 --> 19:05.952
for a whole lot more Katie Otto to hate.

19:06.021 --> 19:07.921
I am going to be at every PTA meeting,

19:07.989 --> 19:09.055
every mixer,

19:09.124 --> 19:10.957
and every one of your stupid events

19:11.026 --> 19:12.892
fighting for my daughter

19:12.961 --> 19:14.694
to get the care that she needs.

19:14.763 --> 19:16.963
But if you give us your vote,

19:17.032 --> 19:18.398
I will resign,

19:18.467 --> 19:20.366
and you will never see me or my wife

19:20.435 --> 19:22.669
at another PTA meeting again.

19:26.475 --> 19:28.608
- I hate you.
- I'm washing my hand.

19:35.183 --> 19:37.350
Greg and I make a pretty good team.

19:37.419 --> 19:38.785
Attention, all.

19:39.988 --> 19:42.555
I hereby resign from the PTA.

20:06.133 --> 20:07.768
A coat can't kill me.

20:08.011 --> 20:09.267
A coat can't kill me.

20:09.336 --> 20:10.736
Man is inherently good.

20:10.804 --> 20:11.804
Man is inherently good.

20:11.872 --> 20:13.405
Man is inherently good.

20:13.474 --> 20:14.973
Doesn't take you too long to pee.

20:15.042 --> 20:16.908
Doesn't take you too long to pee.

20:16.977 --> 20:19.144
Doesn't take you too long to pee.

20:19.213 --> 20:21.680
These kids have not
ruined your body and life.

20:21.749 --> 20:24.349
These kids have not ruined
your body and life.

20:24.418 --> 20:26.952
These kids have not ruined
your body and life.

20:27.020 --> 20:29.454
These kids have not ruined
your body and life.
