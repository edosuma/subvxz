WEBVTT

00:01.835 --> 00:02.370
Previously on "The Path"...

00:02.403 --> 00:03.637
- I want to apologize.

00:03.671 --> 00:06.640
- I would ask that you stop your
campaign of false propaganda.

00:06.674 --> 00:08.218
The stuff that DeKaan
puts in that water

00:08.242 --> 00:09.818
isn't going to show up
on your average tests.

00:09.843 --> 00:12.213
- Can you find it?
- Yeah, but it's not cheap.

00:12.246 --> 00:13.781
I told the people of Clarksville

00:13.814 --> 00:15.149
that I would test their water,

00:15.183 --> 00:16.817
and now I need the funds
to do it.

00:16.850 --> 00:19.287
- She blackmailed you.
- I can go to jail if I have to.

00:19.320 --> 00:21.422
- I am not letting you
go to jail.

00:21.455 --> 00:23.724
- I had other relationships.
- You're my wife,

00:23.757 --> 00:27.695
and I am with you,
if you're with me... only me.

00:27.728 --> 00:29.063
- The meds are going to help

00:29.097 --> 00:30.831
ease the panic attacks,
dysphoria.

00:30.864 --> 00:33.701
I spoke with a colleague
who gave me information

00:33.734 --> 00:35.236
about a support group.

00:35.269 --> 00:38.172
- My name is Eddie,
and I was in a cult.

00:38.206 --> 00:39.716
- But I owe my life to Steve
and his work,

00:39.740 --> 00:41.309
and I will find who hurt him.

00:41.342 --> 00:44.812
- What if that man was Cal?

00:44.845 --> 00:47.781
- There's someone among us?

00:49.000 --> 00:55.074

01:31.225 --> 01:34.128
I remember... I think
I was eight or nine,

01:34.162 --> 01:39.167
Steve asked me what I thought
The Movement had most to fear.

01:39.200 --> 01:41.435
"Ignorance," I answered.

01:41.469 --> 01:43.437
"No," he replied.

01:43.471 --> 01:45.306
"Complacency."

01:45.339 --> 01:48.209
Our own complacency.

01:48.242 --> 01:51.545
It's so easy to become fixated
on the rungs,

01:51.579 --> 01:54.515
both the one you're on now,
and the one you're ascending to.

01:54.548 --> 01:57.151
Always, always inside
your own head,

01:57.185 --> 01:59.196
where you find you can think
of nothing but ascension.

01:59.220 --> 02:02.490
It's a... it's a kind
of tunnel vision, so...

02:02.523 --> 02:06.227
- Why are they doing this?

02:06.260 --> 02:08.929
- Did you talk to Cal?

02:08.961 --> 02:12.766
- I saw murder in his eyes.

02:12.800 --> 02:16.437
I've seen that look
too many times.

02:16.470 --> 02:21.775
I checked the travel records.
He was here when Steve died.

02:21.809 --> 02:25.379
- So he didn't do it
with his bare hands.

02:25.413 --> 02:27.181
Sarah asked me to come back.

02:27.215 --> 02:30.184
She needed someone here
with Steve's interest at heart.

02:30.218 --> 02:34.288
- Is what she's doing now
with Steve's interest at heart?

02:34.322 --> 02:37.291
- There's always more space
to be filled with...

02:37.325 --> 02:39.860
With all that The Light
has to give us.

02:39.893 --> 02:43.797
And that is why we source.

02:46.700 --> 02:48.636
Have a seat.

02:56.310 --> 02:57.778
How are you today, Oliver?

02:57.811 --> 02:59.680
- Good, sir.

02:59.713 --> 03:01.415
- No need to call me sir.

03:01.449 --> 03:03.651
Nothing to be nervous about,
really.

03:03.684 --> 03:05.219
- Okay.
- Can you go ahead and place

03:05.253 --> 03:06.587
your left hand, palm down,

03:06.620 --> 03:10.324
on the clear page
in front of you?

03:10.358 --> 03:11.625
- Like this?

03:11.659 --> 03:14.762
- That's exactly right.

03:14.795 --> 03:16.897
Do you understand
why you're here?

03:16.930 --> 03:19.733
- I think so.
- Mm-hmm.

03:19.767 --> 03:22.703
- Is it supposed to do this?

03:26.940 --> 03:30.578
- We keep damage stored
inside of us.

03:30.611 --> 03:31.945
It becomes chemicals.

03:31.979 --> 03:33.547
When the right questions
are asked,

03:33.581 --> 03:36.684
the chemicals mix
with our sweat.

03:36.717 --> 03:39.920
The pink tells us
that you're holding back.

03:39.953 --> 03:41.955
You need to uncover more,

03:41.989 --> 03:44.425
so we can help you...

03:44.458 --> 03:47.861
help yourself.

03:56.003 --> 03:59.907
Can you state your name for me?

03:59.940 --> 04:02.310
- My name is Eddie Lane.

04:02.343 --> 04:07.315
Um... it's my second time here.

04:07.348 --> 04:08.982
I've been out of my, uh...

04:09.016 --> 04:13.787
I left my cult, um...

04:13.821 --> 04:15.723
six months ago.

04:15.756 --> 04:19.360
And it's been, uh,
it's been hard.

04:19.392 --> 04:21.695
You know,
I've had panic attacks,

04:21.728 --> 04:23.997
um... paranoia.

04:24.031 --> 04:26.434
- We've all been there.

04:26.467 --> 04:29.637
We call this the Anomie stage.

04:29.670 --> 04:34.041
You're refocusing
from the group mind to the I.

04:34.074 --> 04:37.044
You're asking who am I.

04:37.077 --> 04:41.849
- Yeah, which has been...
- It's been hard.

04:41.882 --> 04:46.354
'Cause I've spent the last,
God, almost 20 years

04:46.387 --> 04:48.456
knowing what this
was all about, you know.

04:48.489 --> 04:52.393
I was going to sleep
for what I was waking up for.

04:52.426 --> 04:55.829
You know, I knew what
was going to happen when...

04:55.863 --> 04:58.065
when I died.

04:58.098 --> 05:01.669
Um, I knew how to raise my kids.

05:04.772 --> 05:09.410
I, uh... I had my kids.

05:09.443 --> 05:12.580
And the thing is,
I really thought

05:12.613 --> 05:16.049
that I was freer
that I had even been.

05:17.885 --> 05:20.754
You know, freer...

05:20.788 --> 05:24.792
I thought I was freer
than the rest of the world.

05:27.795 --> 05:32.666
But, you know,
now I see the truth.

05:36.704 --> 05:39.507
It controlled me.

05:39.540 --> 05:42.910
Are you free?

05:42.943 --> 05:45.879
I don't think so.
Not yet.

05:45.913 --> 05:49.617
Well, what controls you?

05:49.650 --> 05:51.785
Pornography. Yeah, that
would definitely be my thing.

05:51.819 --> 05:54.888
- It's all been like this.
- Run of the mill, sex stuff.

05:54.922 --> 05:57.558
Before I came here,
I was watching it, like,

05:57.591 --> 05:59.560
16 hours a day.

05:59.593 --> 06:01.895
- I told you
there's been nothing.

06:01.929 --> 06:03.564
If the FBI have someone
among us,

06:03.597 --> 06:07.468
I haven't found them yet.

06:10.604 --> 06:14.007
Sarah, um...

06:14.041 --> 06:17.645
Lisa Jackson would have
told you anything

06:17.678 --> 06:19.613
to get her tape back.

06:19.647 --> 06:23.116
- Mm, you weren't there.
- She was telling the truth.

06:23.150 --> 06:26.086
And it could be anyone.

06:27.755 --> 06:31.492
- Guilt can be very powerful.

06:31.525 --> 06:33.461
- Keep looking.

06:39.800 --> 06:42.202
- This is just routine.

06:42.235 --> 06:44.171
You can relax.

06:53.013 --> 06:56.049
Oh, man.

06:56.083 --> 06:59.620
So good we do this.

06:59.653 --> 07:02.690
- I don't smoke anymore.
- I just... just in case.

07:02.723 --> 07:06.694
- It's all good.
- This is why we source.

07:06.727 --> 07:09.863
"To uncover that which
you hide from yourself."

07:09.897 --> 07:12.533
It's beautiful.

07:12.566 --> 07:15.102
Now you decide what to do.

07:15.135 --> 07:18.005
You want to put it back
under the mattress,

07:18.038 --> 07:19.807
or give over.

07:19.840 --> 07:21.709
Completely.

07:21.742 --> 07:23.010
Empty yourself,

07:23.043 --> 07:25.813
so that you can be filled
with The Truth.

07:32.753 --> 07:35.523
Yeah!

07:38.125 --> 07:39.827
All right, girls, who's next?

07:39.860 --> 07:41.729
Do you find
you can trust people?

07:41.762 --> 07:43.797
No.

07:43.831 --> 07:46.233
No?

07:46.266 --> 07:50.270
- I'm ex-military.
- I worked in security for years.

07:50.303 --> 07:54.007
Life experience has beaten
the trust out of me.

07:54.041 --> 07:57.077
- Yeah.

07:57.110 --> 08:02.883
So you, uh,
you know all the tactics then.

08:02.916 --> 08:06.086
To deceive.

08:06.119 --> 08:09.189
- That's my job.

08:09.222 --> 08:13.627
It was my job.

08:13.661 --> 08:16.530
Knowing what deception
looks like.

09:17.725 --> 09:20.227
Decided to buck the
limitations of The Light, huh?

09:20.260 --> 09:23.363
Chose free will.
Leadership over the "word."

09:23.396 --> 09:25.633
- Let's just say
The Light provided.

09:25.666 --> 09:27.300
We received a donation.

09:27.334 --> 09:29.045
- We're very grateful.
- We've been having trouble

09:29.069 --> 09:31.004
finding someone
to take on the testing.

09:31.038 --> 09:35.609
- Well, I told Sarah here
I'd be glad to do it.

09:35.643 --> 09:37.377
I love to stick it to the man
and God,

09:37.410 --> 09:39.246
whoever I can
who thinks he's above me.

09:39.279 --> 09:41.949
- I can offer you 25 grand.

09:41.982 --> 09:44.384
I thought perhaps you'd like
to donate the extra cost

09:44.417 --> 09:45.986
of your services
to the greater good.

09:46.019 --> 09:47.196
- The kind of testing
you're asking for

09:47.220 --> 09:48.956
is time-consuming
and expensive.

09:48.989 --> 09:51.959
- The community's trying
to pull together extra funds.

09:51.992 --> 09:53.102
If I get my friends
and neighbors

09:53.126 --> 09:54.995
to throw in their last dimes,

09:55.028 --> 09:59.867
how can we be sure you're gonna
find what's in the water?

09:59.900 --> 10:02.636
- You believe there's something
in your water, Mr. Small?

10:02.670 --> 10:05.205
- I know there's something
in our water.

10:53.486 --> 10:55.422
What did he do?

10:55.455 --> 10:57.825
- Hey, what's going on?
- I'm his mother.

10:57.858 --> 10:59.426
- We have a warrant
for Hawk Lane.

10:59.459 --> 11:01.094
- What for?
- Breaking and entering,

11:01.128 --> 11:02.462
vandalism.

11:02.495 --> 11:05.799
They'll explain the charges
after booking.

11:05.833 --> 11:07.134
- Mom, is this...

11:07.167 --> 11:09.069
- You need a lawyer
before you say anything.

11:09.102 --> 11:11.304
- Okay, listen, I'm gonna be
right behind you, okay?

11:11.338 --> 11:14.107
- Mom, what's going on?
- It's gonna be okay.

11:23.516 --> 11:27.387
- Everything's ruined.
- The fridge is completely broken.

11:27.420 --> 11:29.456
- Does he know?

11:29.489 --> 11:32.192
Does Cal know the baby
could be his?

11:32.225 --> 11:33.360
- I don't think so.

11:33.393 --> 11:36.129
- I got called in
to source today.

11:36.163 --> 11:37.774
How am I not going
to tell him everything?

11:37.798 --> 11:38.975
- How am I not going to...
- You can't.

11:38.999 --> 11:40.968
You have to keep everything
inside.

11:41.001 --> 11:44.738
- But how?
- And why?

11:44.772 --> 11:47.140
- Because we can use it.

11:47.174 --> 11:50.210
Cal doesn't want anyone to know
something happened between us.

11:50.243 --> 11:53.914
He doesn't want Sarah to know.

11:53.947 --> 11:57.751
I love our life.
I love this house.

11:57.785 --> 12:02.089
We can have more.
Just need to be careful.

12:19.940 --> 12:22.810
- Hey, how's it going,
sweetheart?

12:22.843 --> 12:25.779
- You can take the bottom bunk.

12:31.584 --> 12:34.354
- Hi, I'm Hawk.

12:34.387 --> 12:37.324
- He don't talk to us.
- 'Cause we're white.

12:39.893 --> 12:41.161
- I'm Hawk.
- Nice to meet you.

12:41.194 --> 12:43.831
- Hawk, that's like a bird,
Hawk.

12:43.864 --> 12:45.165
You got a cool name.

12:45.198 --> 12:48.035
You got big hair,
that's cool hair.

12:52.072 --> 12:54.541
- So wh... what'd you do
to get in here?

12:54.574 --> 12:56.844
- I'm just gonna read...

12:56.877 --> 12:59.947
if that's okay.

12:59.980 --> 13:01.281
- When can I see my son?

13:01.314 --> 13:03.250
- As soon as his attorney
comes out.

13:03.283 --> 13:04.885
- Hey, what the hell happened?

13:04.918 --> 13:06.219
- I don't know.
- You don't know?

13:06.253 --> 13:07.955
Our kid's locked up.

13:07.988 --> 13:10.891
No, no, I want a real lawyer,
not your cult lawyer.

13:10.924 --> 13:12.893
- So that's what you think now,
I'm in a cult?

13:12.926 --> 13:15.428
- Sarah, this is bullshit, okay?
- This is our kid.

13:15.462 --> 13:17.330
- Okay, I need you to stay calm.

13:17.364 --> 13:21.268
Let me explain what's going on
because it isn't good.

13:27.474 --> 13:28.876
Are you okay?

13:28.909 --> 13:30.177
- Yeah, I'm okay.

13:30.210 --> 13:31.912
- We're gonna get you
out of here.

13:31.945 --> 13:34.114
- Why would Ms. DeKaan do this?

13:34.147 --> 13:36.416
I apologized, she said she would
drop the charges.

13:36.449 --> 13:38.451
- I brought the water in
to be tested.

13:38.485 --> 13:41.054
- Oh, so you put The Movement
over your family.

13:41.088 --> 13:42.455
- No big surprise.
- Stop it, Dad.

13:42.489 --> 13:44.057
- I thought I did it
under the radar.

13:44.091 --> 13:45.268
I have no idea
how she found out.

13:45.292 --> 13:47.060
- I'm glad you stood up to her.

13:47.094 --> 13:48.471
- No, you don't know
what you're talking about.

13:48.495 --> 13:50.964
Hawk, you don't want to ruin
your life at 16.

13:50.998 --> 13:52.132
- Why is he here?

13:52.165 --> 13:53.600
- Because I am your father

13:53.633 --> 13:55.344
and someone has to look out
for your best interest.

13:55.368 --> 13:57.304
- I can look out
for my own best interest.

13:57.337 --> 13:58.505
- Okay, let's settle down.

13:58.538 --> 14:01.108
This is not a simple situation.

14:01.141 --> 14:02.575
These charges are extreme.

14:02.609 --> 14:05.012
Breaking and entering,
vandalism,

14:05.045 --> 14:07.580
- assault with a deadly weapon.
- What weapon?

14:07.614 --> 14:11.384
- And the worst of it is,
she somehow was able to pressure

14:11.418 --> 14:14.154
the DA into slapping Hawk with
a domestic terrorism charge.

14:14.187 --> 14:15.622
- What?
- It's a federal offense

14:15.655 --> 14:18.225
with huge ramifications.

14:18.258 --> 14:19.659
- What a nightmare.

14:19.692 --> 14:23.230
- Terrorism?
- You have got to be kidding me.

14:23.263 --> 14:25.498
- Falls under Eco-terrorism,
but it's treated the same

14:25.532 --> 14:27.134
as any other kind of terrorism.

14:27.167 --> 14:28.969
The last thing
The Movement needs...

14:29.002 --> 14:30.938
- I don't care how this affects
The Movement.

14:30.971 --> 14:33.040
I care how it affects my son.

14:33.073 --> 14:34.641
- DeKaan has friends
and influence,

14:34.674 --> 14:36.443
but she doesn't have The Light.

14:36.476 --> 14:39.412
Oh, my God.

14:39.446 --> 14:41.348
- I don't want to be
blackmailed.

14:41.381 --> 14:43.616
It's okay.
I can do this.

14:43.650 --> 14:47.154
- No, it is not okay, Hawk.
- So what happens now?

14:47.187 --> 14:49.322
Can he come home
until the trial?

14:49.356 --> 14:51.291
- He's being detained
until they set bail.

14:51.324 --> 14:53.626
- When's that?
- We don't have a date yet.

14:53.660 --> 14:56.496
They have 45 hours.

15:03.336 --> 15:05.638
- I re-listened to our sourcing
session this morning,

15:05.672 --> 15:09.276
and some of your prior
unburdening tapes.

15:14.047 --> 15:15.983
Your baby died.

15:18.218 --> 15:20.954
I'm sorry.

15:20.988 --> 15:25.558
That must be the most brutal
thing in the world.

15:25.592 --> 15:28.528
You have two other
young children.

15:31.264 --> 15:32.966
- Yes.

15:33.000 --> 15:38.505
- What... what if we could reunite
you with your family?

15:43.210 --> 15:46.679
- Yes, yes, I'd...
- I'd like that.

15:46.713 --> 15:48.115
- I think we can do that.

15:48.148 --> 15:50.483
I-I think that
should be your goal,

15:50.517 --> 15:55.588
your family back together,
part of our family.

15:59.159 --> 16:01.394
- I have reason to believe

16:01.428 --> 16:06.699
there may be someone among us
working for the FBI.

16:09.169 --> 16:13.006
- No way.
- Here?

16:13.040 --> 16:15.142
No, I-I don't see that.

16:15.175 --> 16:18.478
- No.

16:18.511 --> 16:22.482
I checked your references
in security, um...

16:24.484 --> 16:26.719
You have a tremendous amount
of experience.

16:26.753 --> 16:30.457
- Yeah.

16:30.490 --> 16:33.793
- I-I'd like you
to help us out, Sam.

16:36.529 --> 16:40.333
- Yes, of course.

16:44.171 --> 16:46.273
- Good.

16:46.306 --> 16:48.608
Good.

16:49.776 --> 16:51.244
- Hi, um, Ms. DeKaan,

16:51.278 --> 16:53.713
it's me, Sarah, calling again,

16:53.746 --> 16:56.816
and, um, I am very, very sorry.

16:56.849 --> 16:58.518
I know you are angry,

16:58.551 --> 17:01.121
but I'm just asking you
to please

17:01.154 --> 17:05.558
call me back.
I'm... I'm begging you, please.

17:05.592 --> 17:07.794
Please just call me.

17:07.827 --> 17:09.628
- I can't believe
she won't talk it out.

17:09.662 --> 17:11.064
We should go to her house.

17:11.098 --> 17:12.799
Russel and I
can drive over there.

17:12.832 --> 17:15.502
- No, no, no, Carla said that'll
just make things worse.

17:15.535 --> 17:17.670
- Hey, you know, kids...
- Guys!

17:17.704 --> 17:19.515
- Kids, please, can you just
go upstairs to play?

17:19.539 --> 17:23.109
- Upstairs, everyone.
- Russel, make them play upstairs.

17:23.143 --> 17:24.676
I'm trying.

17:28.181 --> 17:30.417
You okay, sweetie?

17:30.450 --> 17:34.754
- Hey.
- You all right?

17:34.787 --> 17:39.159
- Is Hawk in trouble because
we've been seeing a Denier?

17:39.192 --> 17:42.129
- What Denier?

17:44.197 --> 17:45.832
- He sees the kids, Mom.

17:45.865 --> 17:47.734
At least he did.

17:47.767 --> 17:52.639
You know, Hawk doesn't see him
anymore, but Summer does.

17:52.672 --> 17:54.607
He's her father, Mom.

17:59.246 --> 18:01.514
- What happened
to your brother...

18:01.548 --> 18:03.483
- Gaby, go gentle.

18:05.918 --> 18:09.322
- It has nothing to do
with you seeing your dad.

18:09.356 --> 18:12.492
This will all be resolved
very soon.

18:12.525 --> 18:14.694
And your big brother will be
back in his room

18:14.727 --> 18:17.530
where he belongs, okay?

18:17.564 --> 18:19.499
Okay?

18:24.871 --> 18:26.806
- Hey, come here.

18:41.354 --> 18:43.790
- I'm sorry, I have to unburden.

18:43.823 --> 18:46.226
Russel never goes against
the word,

18:46.259 --> 18:48.661
follows all the rules, and she's
the Guardian of the Light?

18:48.695 --> 18:51.331
- Have some compassion, sweetie.

18:51.364 --> 18:53.300
- And keep your mouth shut.

18:56.403 --> 19:00.240
- Russel, I want to go home.

19:00.273 --> 19:02.275
Now.

19:04.744 --> 19:08.415
- That was good of you...
- the Summer part.

19:08.448 --> 19:10.817
- Well, you would think
it was good

19:10.850 --> 19:12.952
because you're guilty
of the same thing Sarah is.

19:12.985 --> 19:15.488
- Gaby, you've been accusing me
of that for years.

19:15.522 --> 19:17.724
- It's just not true.
- Just unburden.

19:17.757 --> 19:20.360
- I'm not the one
who needs to unburden.

19:20.393 --> 19:22.495
I know why Kodiak
went to Siberia.

19:22.529 --> 19:26.366
- To escape persecution.
- It had nothing to do with me.

19:26.399 --> 19:27.767
- He wanted to get over you.

19:27.800 --> 19:30.503
- He got caught
dealing marijuana.

19:30.537 --> 19:32.339
I'm not having
this conversation.

19:32.372 --> 19:35.742
- I need to because having him
here is throwing me off.

19:35.775 --> 19:38.445
- I'm with you, Hank.

19:38.478 --> 19:41.481
You...
I always have been.

19:41.514 --> 19:44.917
Don't let your fears
send you down that road again.

19:44.951 --> 19:49.556
- Gab...
- Don't lie. Just don't.

19:49.589 --> 19:53.326
Don't backpedal.

19:53.360 --> 19:55.695
I am with you.

21:09.502 --> 21:11.638
Okay.

21:24.083 --> 21:26.052
- Hey.
- Cal.

21:26.085 --> 21:27.963
- I came as soon as I heard
Hawk was in trouble.

21:27.987 --> 21:30.623
- Why didn't you call me?
- Look, I am so scared.

21:30.657 --> 21:32.725
I've called Libby DeKaan
a thousand times,

21:32.759 --> 21:34.093
and I'm really afraid
I messed up.

21:34.126 --> 21:35.628
- No, no, no, no, you did not.

21:35.662 --> 21:36.996
You had no way of knowing

21:37.029 --> 21:38.565
Ms. DeKaan was this kind
of a monster.

21:38.598 --> 21:40.367
- She's poisoning
an entire community.

21:40.400 --> 21:41.444
Of course I should have known.

21:41.468 --> 21:42.902
- We will deal with this.

21:42.935 --> 21:44.571
Get in the car, Sarah.

21:44.604 --> 21:45.805
We're talking to Libby.

21:45.838 --> 21:47.440
- Look, I've called her,
all right?

21:47.474 --> 21:48.641
She won't pick up.

21:48.675 --> 21:51.010
- Eddie, we will take care
of this.

21:51.043 --> 21:53.680
- This is a family matter, Cal.

21:53.713 --> 21:56.583
Sarah, just get in the car.

21:56.616 --> 21:58.050
We're gonna go help Hawk.

21:58.084 --> 21:59.628
- Tell me what you need
me to do, all right?

21:59.652 --> 22:01.554
I want to help you
take care of this.

22:01.588 --> 22:04.056
- I can have him taken away
from you, Sarah.

22:04.090 --> 22:05.525
Legally.

22:05.558 --> 22:07.494
This happened on your watch.

22:07.527 --> 22:09.962
Any court of law would agree.

22:09.996 --> 22:11.631
- No, he's wrong, Sarah.

22:14.066 --> 22:16.002
- I have to.

22:31.784 --> 22:34.721
Do you know everything
you need to know?

22:38.991 --> 22:42.795
First thing that
pops into your mind.

22:44.631 --> 22:46.733
Even if you don't understand
the question.

22:46.766 --> 22:49.736
- I know more...

22:49.769 --> 22:52.739
than I should know.

22:52.772 --> 22:56.476
- All right, how so?

22:56.509 --> 22:59.446
- I know things I shouldn't.

23:02.181 --> 23:05.485
Like I know that becoming
a father is making me...

23:05.518 --> 23:06.786
feel different.

23:06.819 --> 23:08.755
- Different?

23:08.788 --> 23:10.957
- Well, in "The Ladder"
it says that

23:10.990 --> 23:13.059
family is important,

23:13.092 --> 23:16.796
"if the individual family
in our communities are working,

23:16.829 --> 23:20.767
then our larger family
is working."

23:20.800 --> 23:24.871
- I'm... I'm not sure I'm, uh,
I'm following you.

23:24.904 --> 23:27.106
- Now that I'm becoming
a father,

23:27.139 --> 23:30.477
I have needs
for my individual family.

23:30.510 --> 23:33.980
Things me and Mary
and the baby need.

23:35.748 --> 23:37.116
- Like?

23:39.151 --> 23:42.188
- A new refrigerator
for the guest house.

23:42.221 --> 23:44.156
Ours is broken, and it's small.

23:44.190 --> 23:47.026
We need
a full-sized refrigerator.

23:48.895 --> 23:53.132
- Well, I-I think
that'll do, uh, Sean, yeah.

23:53.165 --> 23:55.134
Thank you for coming in.

24:13.886 --> 24:16.989
We are not free.

24:17.023 --> 24:19.926
Even when they unlock the door
to this prison,

24:19.959 --> 24:23.496
we are still prisoners.

24:23.530 --> 24:26.566
506 deaths in Chicago last year,

24:26.599 --> 24:31.237
96% brown people.

24:31.270 --> 24:34.206
Want to know how many died
on Memorial weekend this year?

24:34.240 --> 24:36.108
63.

24:36.142 --> 24:38.778
63 people on the South Side,
brown people,

24:38.811 --> 24:40.780
youngest was 16.

24:40.813 --> 24:43.850
A young girl sitting in the car
next to her boyfriend.

24:45.885 --> 24:48.755
We have a visitor.

24:48.788 --> 24:50.056
- Is it okay if I listen?

24:50.089 --> 24:53.760
- What's your book say about it?

24:53.793 --> 24:56.028
Your little Ladder book.

24:56.062 --> 24:58.097
Yeah, I did my research.

24:58.130 --> 24:59.566
What's your book got to say

24:59.599 --> 25:02.068
about what's happening
in America?

25:02.101 --> 25:04.671
- It was written
in the '70s, so...

25:04.704 --> 25:08.307
- And you think all this shit
wasn't happening in the '70s?

25:08.340 --> 25:10.777
White man who wrote your book
left it all out, didn't he?

25:12.111 --> 25:14.280
- No.

25:14.313 --> 25:16.949
Doc acknowledged that
we were destroying ourselves

25:16.983 --> 25:19.819
with violence and pollution.

25:19.852 --> 25:21.954
He didn't, but the...
The Light did,

25:21.988 --> 25:25.892
and then The Light gave him the
message, and he wrote it down.

25:25.925 --> 25:27.994
- The Light?

25:34.066 --> 25:37.003
- Everyone is equal
in our Movement.

25:37.036 --> 25:39.806
- Equal in your Movement,

25:39.839 --> 25:43.275
but better than everyone else
in the world?

25:43.309 --> 25:45.845
Did the guy who wrote your book
write it that way

25:45.878 --> 25:50.683
so you had an excuse
to turn a blind eye?

25:50.717 --> 25:53.753
- I'm in here because I stood up
for people

25:53.786 --> 25:55.888
outside of our Movement.

25:55.922 --> 26:00.292
People whose water
was being poisoned.

26:00.326 --> 26:03.963
- And you'll be out of this
prison in two days tops,

26:03.996 --> 26:05.665
and not because
of your book there.

26:05.698 --> 26:09.068
Because that's the way
the system works.

26:09.101 --> 26:11.337
You may think
you're not a cog in it,

26:11.370 --> 26:13.172
but you are.

26:18.344 --> 26:20.179
- Do you have a plan, Eddie?

26:20.212 --> 26:22.114
Or are we just gonna sit here
all day?

26:22.148 --> 26:24.651
- We're gonna sit here until
she comes out of the building.

26:24.684 --> 26:26.619
And then we're gonna
talk to her.

26:26.653 --> 26:28.934
- I don't know what you're gonna
say, she's a tough woman.

26:29.956 --> 26:33.325
- No way, that's not...
- That's her.

26:43.135 --> 26:45.004
- Excuse me, Ms. DeKaan.

26:45.037 --> 26:48.708
Uh, hi, my name is Eddie Lane.
I'm Hawk Lane's father.

26:48.741 --> 26:50.977
- Yes, I was very upfront
with your wife,

26:51.010 --> 26:52.879
and she refused my generosity.

26:52.912 --> 26:56.048
- So now you're gonna throw
our son in jail for terrorism?

26:56.082 --> 26:58.084
What are you?

26:58.117 --> 27:01.020
We will stop everything.
I will withdraw the testing.

27:01.053 --> 27:04.056
I am begging you.
You'll never see us ever again.

27:06.258 --> 27:10.362
- Hey, I know my wife put you
in a complicated position,

27:10.396 --> 27:12.031
but I don't think you want
anything else

27:12.064 --> 27:13.866
on your conscience.

27:13.900 --> 27:18.270
It must be so painful that
your own son won't talk to you.

27:19.839 --> 27:21.841
- Who the fuck do you think
you are?

27:21.874 --> 27:24.276
I will crush you.

27:24.310 --> 27:26.813
- But he wants
to talk to you now.

27:28.447 --> 27:31.951
Hey, Brendon, here she is.

27:35.254 --> 27:38.157
- You called my fucking son?

27:38.190 --> 27:42.161
You're sick.
You're sick.

27:47.199 --> 27:49.702
Brendon?

27:49.736 --> 27:51.738
Hello?

27:51.771 --> 27:54.440
Honey?

27:54.473 --> 27:58.010
How are you?

27:58.044 --> 28:00.179
Of course.

28:04.951 --> 28:06.418
You're sadistic.

28:09.255 --> 28:12.024
- You know, it's already hard
enough to sleep at night.

28:12.058 --> 28:15.461
Locking our kid away
isn't gonna make it easier.

28:36.548 --> 28:40.019
- How did you know...
- about the son?

28:40.052 --> 28:41.754
- Uh, Google.

28:41.788 --> 28:46.325
I just, you know,
did a bunch of research and...

28:46.358 --> 28:49.428
I read that she had a kid.

28:49.461 --> 28:52.799
They got in this
big public disagreement.

28:52.832 --> 28:55.334
Now they don't talk.

28:55.367 --> 28:58.771
You know, I just kept thinking
to myself that...

28:58.805 --> 29:00.339
I would do anything

29:00.372 --> 29:04.176
to get Hawk
to want to talk to me again.

29:05.978 --> 29:08.480
Hopefully Libby feels
the same way about her kid.

29:08.514 --> 29:10.850
- I am so sorry, Eddie.

29:13.385 --> 29:16.856
You know,
if I have done anything...

29:16.889 --> 29:19.458
to sabotage Hawk's future, I...

29:19.491 --> 29:22.061
will never forgive myself.

29:24.330 --> 29:27.166
And Summer...

29:27.199 --> 29:30.169
- now she's so confused.
- How is she confused?

29:30.202 --> 29:31.904
- About... about why
this is happening.

29:31.938 --> 29:33.239
You know, I...

29:35.541 --> 29:38.444
She's confused.
I'm confused.

29:38.477 --> 29:43.916
- Hey, we are not going to let
anything bad happen to Hawk.

29:43.950 --> 29:45.952
- But it's out of our hands.

29:50.456 --> 29:54.193
- All this praying

29:54.226 --> 29:57.897
and looking to The Light,

29:57.930 --> 30:01.567
it's not gonna help us.

30:01.600 --> 30:03.102
- Hey.

30:07.206 --> 30:11.944
You are strong, okay.

30:11.978 --> 30:15.581
And we are going
to get through this.

30:50.082 --> 30:52.018
- Cal.

31:01.327 --> 31:04.630
- I won't be blackmailed.

31:04.663 --> 31:06.598
- Yes, you will.

31:18.477 --> 31:23.082
- Is... is the baby mine?

31:24.984 --> 31:27.253
Or could he be mine?

31:27.286 --> 31:30.089
- Yes.

31:30.122 --> 31:33.359
- What, he's mine,
or he could be mine?

31:33.392 --> 31:36.362
- I don't know.

31:36.395 --> 31:38.330
That's the truth.

31:42.234 --> 31:45.037
But it could be yours.

31:58.684 --> 32:00.152
- Big breath out for me.

32:02.121 --> 32:04.723
- Well, I cannot find
anything wrong.

32:04.756 --> 32:06.392
- Really?

32:06.425 --> 32:08.727
'Cause, you know, my heart
all of a sudden

32:08.760 --> 32:10.662
will just start beating fast.

32:10.696 --> 32:14.566
- Well, you can go into town
for an EKG to be sure.

32:14.600 --> 32:16.002
But you know what I think?

32:16.035 --> 32:17.669
- What's that?

32:17.703 --> 32:20.406
- All that work you're doing
in 1R is bringing stuff up,

32:20.439 --> 32:23.009
and that stuff can hurt.

32:23.042 --> 32:26.678
- Sam, you okay?

32:26.712 --> 32:29.148
- Hey, yeah.
- Seems so.

32:29.181 --> 32:31.217
Well, Shelby couldn't find
anything.

32:31.250 --> 32:32.684
- Oh, whew.
- Yeah.

32:32.718 --> 32:35.487
I just got this little flutter
in my heart.

32:35.521 --> 32:37.456
It's been kind of
freaking me out.

32:39.758 --> 32:43.462
- I think this one
has pink eye again.

32:43.495 --> 32:44.730
Come on back, sweetie.

32:44.763 --> 32:48.067
Let me check.

32:48.100 --> 32:50.502
- Listen, I heard about
your nephew getting locked up

32:50.536 --> 32:52.304
by DeKaan.

32:52.338 --> 32:55.274
- I'm really sorry to hear that.
- It's truly awful.

32:58.110 --> 32:59.645
Okay, what?

32:59.678 --> 33:01.613
- Nothing, it's just...

33:03.149 --> 33:04.283
Between us, of course.

33:04.316 --> 33:06.518
- Of course.

33:06.552 --> 33:09.155
- I just found out that Sarah
lets the kids see their father.

33:09.188 --> 33:11.690
- Oh, Eddie.
- It doesn't take a psychology

33:11.723 --> 33:14.526
degree to know that's why Hawk
acted out in the first place.

33:14.560 --> 33:16.228
- Yeah.
- You can't lead a double life

33:16.262 --> 33:19.565
and think it's not
gonna mess with your kids.

33:19.598 --> 33:22.234
What?
Sam?

33:28.274 --> 33:31.343
I'm sure Layla is fine.
Let me know how she does, okay?

33:31.377 --> 33:33.312
- Okay.

33:43.322 --> 33:45.691
- Find anything?

33:45.724 --> 33:50.362
Beside the usual incongruities
and Transgress.

33:50.396 --> 33:53.599
- Lots of Damage and despair.

33:53.632 --> 33:55.567
There's work to be done.

33:59.371 --> 34:02.508
Luckily we have some time
for you today.

34:05.411 --> 34:09.114
Steve believed the sourcer
should be sourced,

34:09.148 --> 34:12.083
"so clarity is ensured."

34:15.654 --> 34:17.123
- Hmm.
- Mm.

34:38.643 --> 34:40.846
- What are you really
looking for?

34:40.879 --> 34:43.149
- In life?

34:43.181 --> 34:45.117
- By sourcing?

34:49.521 --> 34:52.558
- We're being investigated
by the FBI.

34:52.591 --> 34:55.127
They have someone working
for them among us,

34:55.161 --> 34:58.096
at least that's what
Sarah and I believe.

34:59.531 --> 35:03.802
- Why would the FBI
be investigating us?

35:03.835 --> 35:07.206
- Religious discrimination.

35:07.239 --> 35:09.341
We've done nothing wrong.

35:09.375 --> 35:11.543
- Now that I know
what to listen for,

35:11.577 --> 35:13.279
maybe I can help.

35:13.312 --> 35:15.681
- Mm.
- Thanks, Richard.

35:15.714 --> 35:18.417
Uh, it probably goes
without saying

35:18.450 --> 35:21.220
we should keep this quiet
from the community.

35:21.253 --> 35:22.721
- Of course.

35:26.258 --> 35:28.260
- Well, I-I should, uh...

35:31.297 --> 35:33.632
Yeah.

35:33.665 --> 35:35.901
See you at the next session.

36:13.372 --> 36:15.607
- Oh, wow.

36:15.641 --> 36:18.744
- Yeah.

36:18.777 --> 36:21.813
- Mmm.
- I almost forgot.

36:21.847 --> 36:23.915
- You forgot?

36:23.949 --> 36:28.587
- Well, I guess I just tried
not to remember.

36:30.422 --> 36:34.793
- I've thought about being
back here so many times.

36:34.826 --> 36:36.295
- Yeah.

36:37.829 --> 36:41.633
- Are you seeing that girl
from the hospital?

36:43.435 --> 36:46.305
- Yeah.

36:46.338 --> 36:48.006
Are you and Cal?

36:48.039 --> 36:51.009
- No.

36:51.042 --> 36:54.446
We could never be together
like that.

36:54.480 --> 36:56.315
I promise.

37:00.486 --> 37:02.354
- I'm worried about you.

37:04.022 --> 37:05.891
Hey.

37:05.924 --> 37:08.494
The hospital helped.

37:08.527 --> 37:11.029
- Did they put you
on medication?

37:11.062 --> 37:13.632
- Yeah.

37:13.665 --> 37:16.968
For anger and depression.

37:17.002 --> 37:18.870
I just...

37:18.904 --> 37:22.841
I just started seeing things
that weren't there.

37:24.743 --> 37:28.314
- What kind of things?

37:28.347 --> 37:32.851
Oh, my God.
Hey, what is that?

37:32.884 --> 37:35.053
What?

37:35.086 --> 37:37.923
- I got struck by lightning.

37:37.956 --> 37:40.492
- What?
- Yeah.

37:40.526 --> 37:42.628
- Why didn't you tell me?
- Are you okay?

37:42.661 --> 37:45.497
- Yeah, it's not...
- Come on, it's... it's fine.

37:45.531 --> 37:47.633
It just looks crazy.

37:47.666 --> 37:50.902
The doctors looked at it.
It's okay.

37:50.936 --> 37:52.838
It's fine.
Look, let's just...

37:52.871 --> 37:54.373
Let's just be here.

37:54.406 --> 37:57.008
All right?
I'm fine.

37:57.042 --> 38:00.712
Let's just stay here.

38:16.728 --> 38:18.364
- I just want to feel it.

38:52.931 --> 38:54.966
- So what happened
with the IRS lady?

38:55.000 --> 38:56.835
- We didn't get what we needed.

38:56.868 --> 38:59.004
Extortion, blackmail.

38:59.037 --> 39:02.574
We, uh, I made an error
in judgment,

39:02.608 --> 39:05.143
and I think Lisa tipped off
the Meyerists.

39:05.176 --> 39:07.546
And now they believe that
we have someone on the inside.

39:07.579 --> 39:08.947
- Is that bad for us?

39:08.980 --> 39:11.750
- No, actually, in fact,
it's a good thing.

39:11.783 --> 39:13.885
I've been asked
to help find the mole.

39:13.919 --> 39:16.722
Paranoia makes people
do stupid things.

39:16.755 --> 39:18.724
We also learned...

39:18.757 --> 39:20.502
that the corruption goes
a little bit further

39:20.526 --> 39:23.161
than the leader.
It's the entire organization.

39:23.194 --> 39:25.731
The Co-Guardian of The Light
is the one that coerced Lisa.

39:25.764 --> 39:28.534
- Guardian of The Light?
- Who could believe this shit?

39:28.567 --> 39:31.603
- Well, my wife believes
a son was born to a virgin.

39:31.637 --> 39:34.740
- Yeah, that's 'cause that
actually happened.

39:34.773 --> 39:37.709
- Right.
- How are you holding up?

39:40.679 --> 39:42.180
- Yeah, I'm fine.

39:42.213 --> 39:45.584
- Your family?
- This must be hard on them.

39:45.617 --> 39:48.820
You know, it's, uh,
challenging, but, uh...

39:48.854 --> 39:51.457
you know, we're okay.
Thanks for asking.

39:51.490 --> 39:53.625
- What is it with guys like us?

39:53.659 --> 39:56.928
What makes us so willing
to sacrifice everything?

39:56.962 --> 40:01.467
Home, family.
Are we just so fucking noble?

40:01.500 --> 40:04.202
- I don't think that it has
anything to do with nobility.

40:04.235 --> 40:06.171
- What then?

40:10.642 --> 40:15.180
- I just want to win.

40:15.213 --> 40:18.049
- Me too.

40:18.083 --> 40:21.553
Let's win this thing.

40:21.587 --> 40:23.822
- Let's win this thing.

40:39.971 --> 40:42.541
My intention
is to light a flame.

40:42.574 --> 40:45.877
Because the America I live in
in devastated by poverty,

40:45.911 --> 40:48.179
social neglect,
economic abandonment,

40:48.213 --> 40:51.883
police brutality,
and mass incarceration.

40:51.917 --> 40:53.251
That's why we all in here.

40:53.284 --> 40:56.955
Because the system is designed
to take us down

40:56.988 --> 40:58.724
and to keep us here.

41:07.699 --> 41:10.669
How'd it go yesterday?

41:10.702 --> 41:12.037
- Talked to Ms. DeKaan.

41:12.070 --> 41:14.205
I don't know
if it'll do any good.

41:14.239 --> 41:16.808
I'm out of my mind.

41:16.842 --> 41:19.778
You put Sam Field on ES.
He's in the middle of 1R.

41:19.811 --> 41:21.880
Yeah, he's, uh,
he's ex-military,

41:21.913 --> 41:25.551
worked in security,
his sourcing came out clear.

41:27.619 --> 41:29.655
It seems like, uh, you and Eddie

41:29.688 --> 41:31.623
are quite
the united front again.

41:31.657 --> 41:34.560
- You'd understand
if you had a kid.

41:34.593 --> 41:37.095
- Yeah.

41:37.128 --> 41:39.998
Steve said, uh, having children

41:40.031 --> 41:42.568
compromised one's ability
to lead.

41:42.601 --> 41:45.170
You know, you'd always be
tempted to put the greater good

41:45.203 --> 41:47.639
of an individual
over the good of the whole.

41:47.673 --> 41:49.608
- Steve was right.

41:54.680 --> 41:57.148
- Was it emotional?

41:57.182 --> 41:58.584
To see Eddie?

41:58.617 --> 42:03.288
Uh, did it make you, uh,
feel for him?

42:03.321 --> 42:05.957
- No.
- Not at all.

42:09.661 --> 42:11.038
- All right, guys,
you want to make sure

42:11.062 --> 42:12.931
that you check under everything.

42:12.964 --> 42:15.901
Cabinets, doors,
it's never in the obvious place.

42:26.912 --> 42:28.680
- I got something here.

42:28.714 --> 42:30.649
- What is it?

42:34.686 --> 42:37.623
- That looks like
a burner phone.

42:40.892 --> 42:43.662
Shelby, is this yours?

42:43.695 --> 42:47.132
- No.

42:47.165 --> 42:49.668
- Could you run and get Cal
for me, please?

42:54.973 --> 42:57.943
- I seriously don't know
whose phone that is.

43:01.246 --> 43:04.683
- I've got a burner phone
with federal numbers on it.

43:08.019 --> 43:10.255
- Shelby?

43:10.288 --> 43:13.191
- It's not my phone, really.

43:15.360 --> 43:17.929
- Are you sure?

43:17.963 --> 43:20.131
- It's really not my phone.

43:20.165 --> 43:23.301
I don't even know
what that kind of phone is.

43:53.999 --> 43:57.302
- Hey.

43:57.335 --> 44:00.138
Hey.

44:00.171 --> 44:01.406
Hey, what...
What happened?

44:01.439 --> 44:03.742
- It's nothing.

44:03.775 --> 44:06.712
Where's Mom?

44:06.745 --> 44:08.847
- Look, she, uh,
she had a meeting.

44:10.749 --> 44:13.151
Hawk, listen to me.

44:13.184 --> 44:17.989
I know... I let you down
with me leaving, but...

44:20.025 --> 44:25.030
I want to make things right
with you, okay?

44:25.063 --> 44:26.998
More than anything.

44:30.068 --> 44:32.003
- How'd you guys get me out?

44:36.875 --> 44:39.077
- Your mom and I talked
to Libby, and...

44:39.110 --> 44:41.312
- Mom dropped the water.

44:41.346 --> 44:43.148
- She had to.

44:43.181 --> 44:45.717
- And now nothing will change
for those people.

44:45.751 --> 44:47.118
- It is a losing battle, Hawk.

44:47.152 --> 44:48.887
- What, so don't even fight?

44:48.920 --> 44:52.490
- It is not your cause.
- It is The Movement's, okay?

44:52.523 --> 44:53.925
Not yours.

44:53.959 --> 44:56.027
- What if I wanted it
to be mine?

44:58.196 --> 45:01.132
You should have let me
stay in there.

46:32.023 --> 46:35.360
- Betty's at the end.

46:35.393 --> 46:38.296
It was Marshall's favorite cow.

46:38.329 --> 46:41.266
She couldn't even make it back
to her stall.

46:50.575 --> 46:55.213
Shh.
It's all right.

46:55.246 --> 46:58.149
Steady.
Steady.

46:58.183 --> 47:00.018
That's good.

47:00.051 --> 47:01.519
Steady.

47:04.956 --> 47:07.893
- I'm so sorry, Marshall.

47:12.998 --> 47:15.400
I'm afraid I have bad news.

47:15.433 --> 47:19.070
Libby DeKaan
had my son arrested,

47:19.104 --> 47:22.540
and I have to pull the funding
for the water testing.

47:26.177 --> 47:29.147
I hate it so much, and...

47:33.251 --> 47:35.220
- It's no problem.

47:38.389 --> 47:41.259
I don't need
to have the water tested.

47:41.292 --> 47:43.161
I know what's in
the fucking water.

47:49.634 --> 47:51.036
That's not what
blood looks like.

47:51.069 --> 47:52.537
That's poison.
