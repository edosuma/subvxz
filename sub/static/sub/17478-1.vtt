00:36.200 --> 00:38.440
<i>The dead have highways...</i>

00:38.720 --> 00:41.520
<i> located in the desert</i>
after our lives ...</ i>

00:41.840 --> 00:45.120
<i> pressure populated by an endless</i>
movement of departing souls. </ i>

00:47.240 --> 00:50.640
<i> You can hear them in the</i>
ruined parts of our world. </ i>

00:50.920 --> 00:54.680
<i> through the cracks caused by barbaric acts,</i>
violence and injustice. </ i>

00:58.240 --> 01:02.640
<i> These roads have signs,</i>
intersections and interchanges. </ i>

01:04.800 --> 01:07.880
<i> On the crosses, the deaths together. </ i></i>

01:09.320 --> 01:12.720
<i> And walk sometimes</i>
to our world. </ i>

02:14.080 --> 02:15.680
Hello, sweetheart.

02:19.600 --> 02:21.720
You okay?

02:23.800 --> 02:25.480
My God!

02:58.960 --> 03:01.000
I look at him.

03:06.960 --> 03:09.560
Are you sure you want to do this?

03:13.840 --> 03:16.000
They want you intact.

03:20.680 --> 03:24.040
He leaves.
You still hear me.

03:56.560 --> 03:58.360
Keep the rest but.

04:02.800 --> 04:07.280
I got it.
I know what I do.

04:08.120 --> 04:11.280
How old are you?
- Say I do not.

04:11.520 --> 04:14.160
Then I do not.

04:19.200 --> 04:23.000
Non stop.
I must continue.

04:23.760 --> 04:25.800
Of course.

04:37.560 --> 04:39.480
Sip?

04:40.920 --> 04:43.440
Everything for me.

04:46.200 --> 04:49.400
Where are you going?
- Road.

04:51.600 --> 04:54.320
As far as possible.

04:58.520 --> 05:02.080
I can help you, I think.

05:03.080 --> 05:05.400
I need to sleep.

06:08.840 --> 06:10.760
Comfortable?

06:35.280 --> 06:38.680
Where are we?
- At the end point.

06:40.920 --> 06:43.440
A collector called me.

06:43.600 --> 06:45.840
Probably from a
dusty old room ...

06:46.160 --> 06:48.920
... with all terrible
artifacts around ...

06:49.560 --> 06:53.480
... as strange tongues,
plastic stuff ...

06:53.840 --> 06:57.480
... droppings of old people.

06:58.520 --> 07:01.320
But just like any collector ...

07:01.640 --> 07:04.960
... can not wait for the next.

07:08.440 --> 07:11.120
And guess what that is?

07:13.000 --> 07:16.720
Your skin. Strange huh?

07:17.040 --> 07:22.080
Who am I to judge.
He paid well.

07:22.680 --> 07:26.600
And maybe I get a bonus,
I like everything in a ...

07:28.400 --> 07:30.640
... a whole knows it.

07:33.240 --> 07:35.440
Please.

07:36.160 --> 07:39.320
What will you?
Should I pass the salt?

07:42.880 --> 07:46.880
I am still off ...

07:47.120 --> 07:49.680
... biology students are ...

07:50.040 --> 07:52.640
... what a beauty like you ...

07:55.760 --> 08:00.880
... tied to lie down on a table,
to be filleted.

08:11.640 --> 08:14.000
Jesus Christ.

08:15.560 --> 08:18.520
You are a blood book.

08:21.680 --> 08:23.800
Read out for me.

08:24.680 --> 08:27.080
Why would I do that?

08:29.320 --> 08:31.320
Well ...

08:39.799 --> 08:41.799
Because ...

08:43.440 --> 08:45.960
... I'll do a proposal.

08:46.400 --> 08:51.600
We can do it slowly ...

08:54.000 --> 08:57.200
Or I can do it quickly.

08:57.840 --> 09:00.000
The choice is yours.

09:02.640 --> 09:06.400
Fast.
- It is up to you.

09:12.920 --> 09:16.600
The dead have their roads.

09:16.960 --> 09:20.640
Roads that lead to crossings.

09:21.080 --> 09:24.960
And coming in our world.

09:25.720 --> 09:29.480
And if you find at some crossroads ...

09:29.760 --> 09:32.800
Do you stop and listen.

09:33.040 --> 09:35.840
Because the dead have stories.

09:56.120 --> 10:00.040
Open the door, Janie.

10:06.120 --> 10:09.600
Hold on.
Janie, make the door open.

10:20.360 --> 10:22.400
Open the door!

10:34.680 --> 10:38.320
Let me in!
- Reverse!

10:45.680 --> 10:47.440
Captain!

10:49.080 --> 10:52.240
Drift not spot us.

10:57.720 --> 11:00.120
Paranormal.

11:00.960 --> 11:05.120
According to Webster scientific
inexplicable.

11:06.600 --> 11:10.120
We live around the paranormal.

11:10.800 --> 11:15.080
If we were better looking and listening.

11:16.480 --> 11:18.520
Remember ...

11:18.880 --> 11:23.120
Because there is no evidence does not
say that it is not.

11:23.320 --> 11:25.480
But is a good start.

11:30.200 --> 11:32.520
Go sit somewhere ...

11:34.760 --> 11:37.280
McNeal.
Simon McNeal.

11:37.680 --> 11:40.600
I am placed.

11:40.800 --> 11:44.040
Welcome Simon McNeal.

11:51.520 --> 11:55.280
Sure, Simon McNeal.

12:22.200 --> 12:24.880
Why are these places there
always ...

12:25.080 --> 12:27.040
Ordinary matter?

12:47.520 --> 12:51.480
The owner is hastily departed
after his daughter is murdered.

12:52.080 --> 12:54.960
Since then it has for sale.

12:55.880 --> 12:58.680
It was built beginning in 1900.

12:59.080 --> 13:02.600
After that J.D Tollington
bought ...

13:03.120 --> 13:06.040
... during the depression.

13:06.840 --> 13:09.320
Smart guy.

13:11.360 --> 13:14.680
He said he could talk with the dead.

13:15.040 --> 13:18.240
People even came from Europe
for him to see.

13:18.440 --> 13:21.600
Moreover, he entertained the rich.

13:21.960 --> 13:25.160
What seems scary things happened.

13:25.520 --> 13:28.280
Rumor has it that during a
session was interrupted ...

13:28.520 --> 13:31.320
... by an invisible hand
his mouth was pressed.

13:31.520 --> 13:35.320
That was so cold that a print
on his skin left behind what looked like a mustache.

13:35.560 --> 13:38.000
The proof is in the autopsy report.

13:38.200 --> 13:40.800
Suddenly he was so
thrown hard against the wall ...

13:41.000 --> 13:44.240
That his ribs were broken
lungs punctured.

13:44.520 --> 13:47.200
He choked in his own blood.

13:48.720 --> 13:52.800
Make you think now?
- That it has happened.

14:06.840 --> 14:11.000
The person left a message on the door.

14:11.640 --> 14:13.520
Written in blood.

14:14.800 --> 14:17.080
Drift not spot us.

14:17.760 --> 14:21.080
The same message as
Janie left.

14:22.240 --> 14:24.440
After you

14:35.920 --> 14:38.040
Nothing wrong with that.

14:38.200 --> 14:42.720
According to her parents loved Janie
much concerned with sex and death.

14:43.040 --> 14:46.720
She took her friends to
sÃ©ances to top it.

15:01.280 --> 15:06.040
Voodoo and pipe turns.
That youth of today.

15:57.400 --> 16:00.080
Probably a truck that drove long.

16:08.520 --> 16:10.560
Steven!

16:13.560 --> 16:17.320
Not my son!

16:37.240 --> 16:40.640
How do you know everything
is what you write?

16:40.880 --> 16:43.160
How do you know it really true?

16:43.880 --> 16:47.240
If we would not open up
the possibilities ...

16:47.680 --> 16:50.840
We would never progress.

16:51.240 --> 16:54.760
The truth is relative.
I mean if you can see ...

16:55.080 --> 16:58.920
... and touch you somewhere for sure.

17:00.320 --> 17:02.600
Professor?

17:06.079 --> 17:10.359
So we should just trust?

17:10.880 --> 17:14.839
It begins with this matter.

17:20.599 --> 17:24.640
Are not you curious about
the local cuisine?

17:26.880 --> 17:29.000
Want some?

17:36.480 --> 17:40.760
Against insomnia.
- You get enough sex.

17:41.400 --> 17:43.760
I'm still available.

17:59.760 --> 18:01.480
What do you think?

18:01.760 --> 18:05.120
That house.
Perfect for a book.

18:05.440 --> 18:09.280
Could.
- Not too enthusiastic.

18:10.760 --> 18:14.800
Most of my fans
think it is fiction.

18:15.080 --> 18:17.120
Is that right?

18:32.960 --> 18:37.400
I study the paranormal
almost ten years.

18:38.200 --> 18:43.600
I have nothing against what came to
is verified. What is beyond doubt.

18:44.680 --> 18:48.000
Just speculation
and probabilities.

18:48.280 --> 18:50.640
All scientific breakthroughs
are based on nothing ...

18:50.880 --> 18:53.480
... but on speculation and
likely present.

18:53.720 --> 18:56.880
Just ask Galileo,
Newton and Darwin.

18:58.120 --> 19:00.320
Would not it be nice ...

19:00.640 --> 19:04.960
.. if your advanced equipment
finally found something to explain?

19:06.640 --> 19:10.200
This way I can prove it.

19:10.560 --> 19:13.600
When we are in?

19:43.040 --> 19:46.520
McNeal.
What are you doing outside in this weather?

19:47.400 --> 19:50.920
I go home.
- Get in, then you get a lift.

20:09.880 --> 20:12.040
What is it?

20:12.400 --> 20:15.360
You should not drive tonight.
- What?

20:16.520 --> 20:19.200
Be careful, Professor.

21:18.360 --> 21:21.240
His brother is deceased
during a car accident.

21:21.480 --> 21:24.880
His truck was in a ditch.
With his head through the windscreen.

21:25.720 --> 21:29.480
He broke his neck.
Simon saw it happen.

21:29.720 --> 21:31.520
What do you mean?

21:31.720 --> 21:35.720
He walked at night in the kitchen, and told
his parents that Stevie was dead.

21:36.120 --> 21:40.080
That his car was verongelukt.
A few minutes later called the police ...

21:40.720 --> 21:44.560
When his parents arrived on the scene,
it was exactly like he had described.

21:46.560 --> 21:51.120
There is something wrong with him.
- Yes, he looks good.

21:52.000 --> 21:55.360
He knew I would get a flat tire.

21:55.720 --> 21:59.000
Coincidence is certainly
too much for the hand?

21:59.200 --> 22:02.360
Maybe he can help us
with our research?

22:12.760 --> 22:16.000
McNeal?
Do you mind?

22:20.240 --> 22:22.680
That night it started.

22:25.280 --> 22:27.480
In my mind.

22:29.720 --> 22:33.600
Then there appeared a journalist
who wanted an interview.

22:36.280 --> 22:39.800
Boy has visions
on the death of his brother.

22:42.080 --> 22:44.960
That it attracts attention.

22:45.280 --> 22:48.520
How do you feel then?
- Strange.

22:49.880 --> 22:53.000
The people treated me
as a celebrity.

22:53.200 --> 22:55.320
You did nothing to address?

22:57.080 --> 22:59.000
Think it.

22:59.680 --> 23:04.120
I was still young.
Did all what was going on.

23:04.640 --> 23:07.760
Then people came to the house.

23:08.040 --> 23:12.000
They wanted that I touched them
and tell what I saw.

23:13.920 --> 23:16.080
So I did ...

23:19.280 --> 23:21.760
... and I saw things.

23:22.240 --> 23:25.600
When people said that I ...
- Was clairvoyant.

23:26.920 --> 23:28.960
Are you well?

23:52.080 --> 23:55.720
You love old songs?
- Well this.

24:01.560 --> 24:03.720
Want to dance?

24:05.640 --> 24:07.880
Come on.

24:09.120 --> 24:11.960
Come on, this is my song.

24:31.800 --> 24:34.280
How did it feel like?

24:35.360 --> 24:39.000
What?
- The first time it happened to you?

24:43.000 --> 24:45.320
The first time.

24:45.680 --> 24:49.920
When a girl was
and the fountain spit blood.

24:50.240 --> 24:52.920
And they found that girl.

24:54.480 --> 24:58.080
You felt you particularly, or not?

25:04.600 --> 25:07.880
There is a house in the neighborhood.

25:08.280 --> 25:13.440
That of Tollington. There is
something terrible happened.

25:15.600 --> 25:18.840
There is a girl killed.
- Good.

25:20.120 --> 25:24.960
You are in a book.
- I want you to help me.

25:39.440 --> 25:41.640
I do not know.

25:42.040 --> 25:45.760
Many people say that I die
my brother got exploited.

25:48.920 --> 25:52.000
My parents have even
money earned.

25:52.440 --> 25:55.560
There is something terrible in
this girl happened.

25:56.160 --> 25:59.720
Do not tell her story be?

26:00.960 --> 26:03.520
You have a gift, Simon.

26:04.560 --> 26:07.120
Waste not.

26:07.560 --> 26:11.160
Help me to find out what
happened in that house.

27:42.560 --> 27:45.320
Is it a good idea?

27:45.880 --> 27:47.600
Can not hurt.

27:48.360 --> 27:52.240
You know him.
You do not know what he wants to achieve.

27:53.280 --> 27:55.960
Maybe he just ...

28:00.600 --> 28:04.720
There is nothing said about three steps.

28:07.760 --> 28:11.000
I get the tickle of this place.

28:14.120 --> 28:16.920
There is something on my back.
- Sure.

28:17.720 --> 28:20.040
Let's put everything here,
and then go tackle a beer.

28:20.280 --> 28:23.680
I'm not kidding.
There is something on my back.

28:39.560 --> 28:42.400
He suddenly strange.

28:42.760 --> 28:44.880
He loves you for a ride.

28:49.760 --> 28:53.000
Why did you do that?

28:59.040 --> 29:02.360
I had to deal with you lot.

29:03.360 --> 29:06.640
Fuck.
Funny.

29:58.400 --> 30:00.200
Hi.

30:02.080 --> 30:04.360
And?

30:05.240 --> 30:07.920
Here is where it all happened?

30:09.160 --> 30:15.280
That's right. Saves you here.
Can I help you?

30:15.640 --> 30:20.320
No, I save me.

30:22.560 --> 30:26.080
My room is just below.
If you call I hear you.

30:26.360 --> 30:27.920
Well.

30:29.360 --> 30:31.320
Good night.

30:57.920 --> 31:01.280
I sleep naked.
- Sure.

31:19.400 --> 31:21.200
Listen.

31:24.280 --> 31:27.360
I hear nothing.
- Right.

31:28.600 --> 31:33.320
I did not even fly
spider or ant seen.

31:34.160 --> 31:37.560
Anywhere.
Do you?

31:40.320 --> 31:45.080
Just as if this place is gemijt.

32:54.560 --> 32:57.120
I can not sleep.

33:02.040 --> 33:04.640
I think I have a fever.

33:21.680 --> 33:24.520
When I as a child could not sleep ...

33:24.800 --> 33:27.600
... my mother was warm milk.

33:27.920 --> 33:32.400
And sometimes I was there.
This must surely be.

35:09.680 --> 35:11.640
Professor?

35:19.800 --> 35:21.760
Is it?

35:23.480 --> 35:28.920
You cried.
- It is fine.

35:31.320 --> 35:34.080
I had a dream.

35:37.080 --> 35:40.440
You can close the door.

36:23.000 --> 36:25.240
Come on, Reg.
Just see what he thinks.

36:25.480 --> 36:28.480
You are obviously unprofessional.

36:29.280 --> 36:31.080
What do you mean?

36:31.280 --> 36:35.000
I'm so trained.
You have a degree.

36:35.240 --> 36:37.400
What he added?

36:37.680 --> 36:41.440
Although only a small chance
to us with the house to help ...

36:41.680 --> 36:43.560
... I will encourage that.

36:44.280 --> 36:47.800
But only that he not only
with the house helps.

36:48.440 --> 36:52.600
If you do not like my approach ...

36:53.040 --> 36:56.640
... then I ask someone else.

37:46.400 --> 37:48.000
Mary?

40:05.000 --> 40:06.560
Jesus!

40:07.280 --> 40:09.960
Excuse me,
I heard you called.

40:11.200 --> 40:13.280
Have you heard?
- What?

40:13.520 --> 40:16.720
Voices, whispering.
Footsteps.

40:17.520 --> 40:20.320
Just listen.
I have included.

40:30.240 --> 40:32.680
There is nothing.

40:37.080 --> 40:39.360
What?

40:46.560 --> 40:49.720
Help, I can not!

40:53.440 --> 40:55.520
What is there, Reg?

41:00.600 --> 41:03.440
I get him open.

41:44.800 --> 41:48.320
My God, what happened?
- I do not know.

41:50.080 --> 41:53.680
I do not know what happened.
- Try not to talk.

41:54.400 --> 41:56.440
I do not know what happened.

42:06.360 --> 42:09.040
I'm dead

42:15.000 --> 42:18.560
I am hell, and vice versa should
Hell me

42:22.440 --> 42:24.880
You can better look at.

42:50.200 --> 42:53.280
That is not something you see every day.

42:53.640 --> 42:56.840
How that all happened, Reg?
- I do not know.

42:57.200 --> 43:01.680
But I also know how David Copperfield
let elephants disappear.

43:02.760 --> 43:05.120
You say that just
was a trick.

43:09.480 --> 43:12.520
Was that whispers that you heard
a trick?

43:15.240 --> 43:17.280
Was it?

43:56.400 --> 43:58.760
Ga some rest.

45:11.840 --> 45:13.880
What are you doing?

45:17.920 --> 45:23.000
What this is, it would
be examined.

45:30.240 --> 45:33.360
We want to make sure of that, right?

45:38.640 --> 45:40.600
Where is he?

45:40.920 --> 45:44.800
I do not know.
He was gone before I awoke.

45:54.120 --> 45:57.520
I'm just curious how this stuff
on the walls came, Nigel.

45:58.000 --> 46:00.760
You are the best forensic expert
I know.

46:02.080 --> 46:06.160
You want me cringe. Ga me eat.

46:06.720 --> 46:09.200
Is your wife than cooking?

46:10.360 --> 46:12.000
Right.

46:12.280 --> 46:15.680
I ga here to start.
Then I let you know what I think.

46:55.960 --> 46:59.880
Let's see if Simon
some tricks in the bag is hidden.

47:17.880 --> 47:20.120
Aspirin.

47:48.480 --> 47:51.360
You are disappointed, Reg.

47:52.440 --> 47:55.000
Nothing to hide, right?

47:59.680 --> 48:03.440
Why do we not investigate.
- You make a joke.

48:04.000 --> 48:07.280
Ga je gang. Go ahead.

48:09.360 --> 48:12.120
Totally yours, wiseacre.

49:33.640 --> 49:36.040
What was that?
- I do not know. It was in the bathroom ...

49:36.120 --> 49:39.040
my equipment and went out of his roof.

50:06.000 --> 50:09.600
My equipment is all percussion
Something is making the war.

50:14.120 --> 50:16.360
Wait.

50:18.320 --> 50:20.800
That can not be alone.

50:41.560 --> 50:44.160
Simon, everything is good with you?

50:53.000 --> 50:55.600
Help me to lift him.

50:58.080 --> 51:00.680
Calm down.

51:02.360 --> 51:05.520
You should lie down.

51:05.920 --> 51:07.920
Ga lie here.

51:10.360 --> 51:13.240
It was real.
- It is good.

51:14.800 --> 51:19.000
It was not like before.
They came here.

51:22.520 --> 51:25.320
You are a fucking joke.

51:55.520 --> 51:57.640
Mocked us

52:00.360 --> 52:04.560
I must have first aid box.
- Mary, I think we should go here.

52:04.840 --> 52:08.160
You make a joke.
- We have enough.

52:11.240 --> 52:15.160
We have something never before seen.
- That I mean come on.

52:15.520 --> 52:17.280
This is ...

52:17.680 --> 52:19.760
I do not know what this is.

52:21.480 --> 52:23.960
I think he is.

52:24.480 --> 52:27.680
He let this happen, and he
Our lightning.

52:28.120 --> 52:31.840
Good, but I think that means we must
go before we are electrocuted.

52:35.280 --> 52:37.720
I need a drink.

53:04.360 --> 53:06.560
Mary ...

53:08.520 --> 53:11.040
I must tell you something.

53:13.920 --> 53:17.120
You should rest.
- No.

53:18.240 --> 53:22.440
I must tell you, what
really going on.

53:22.840 --> 53:25.520
It is not what you think.

53:32.080 --> 53:35.880
I understand it, Simon.
Really.

53:36.200 --> 53:40.320
That you do not.
That you can not.

53:44.000 --> 53:46.800
Tonight was different.

53:49.800 --> 53:53.320
What happened here, tonight ...

53:55.480 --> 53:57.840
that was a miracle.

53:59.760 --> 54:02.320
You are the miracle.

54:03.320 --> 54:06.360
You are the one who all
possible.

54:07.160 --> 54:10.040
You're the one I've waited.

54:11.400 --> 54:16.360
I will tell the world,
and everyone will believe it.

58:27.400 --> 58:31.040
I do not understand.
That is not what happened.

58:34.760 --> 58:40.920
There was something. Something held me,
pushed me.

58:45.160 --> 58:47.560
There was something.

59:00.960 --> 59:04.400
What are you looking at?
What is so important?

59:05.560 --> 59:07.680
The fountain.

59:07.920 --> 59:11.160
That reminds you of the time
you have a girl or not?

59:14.640 --> 59:16.960
I was ten.

59:18.880 --> 59:22.560
There was a park across the street
of our house.

59:23.400 --> 59:26.480
And there was a fountain, where
we always played.

59:26.720 --> 59:28.800
But it was old.

59:29.040 --> 59:31.560
The water never worked.

59:32.920 --> 59:37.520
Then one night, I was
wake of a sound.

59:39.400 --> 59:43.400
The spot anywhere.
The air was steeped ...

59:43.680 --> 59:46.240
but not with water.

59:48.000 --> 59:50.120
With blood.

59:50.600 --> 59:55.240
I did not know what happened, but
it happened almost every night.

59:55.720 --> 59:59.440
And you said nothing.
- I was too scared.

01:00:01.760 --> 01:00:06.280
The fountain was the morning always completely
dry, as if nothing had happened.

01:00:09.320 --> 01:00:13.000
I was afraid that everyone
would think I was crazy.

01:00:16.480 --> 01:00:20.440
A few weeks later, came
the municipal workers ...

01:00:20.760 --> 01:00:24.560
and vomiting from the fountain, to make
for a parking garage.

01:00:26.720 --> 01:00:29.840
When they land uitgroeven,
they found ...

01:00:31.400 --> 01:00:35.280
a ten-year girl, who under
was buried.

01:00:38.680 --> 01:00:40.960
It was ...

01:00:42.880 --> 01:00:45.400
tortured.

01:00:49.440 --> 01:00:53.680
Her DNA was consistent with a man
the five lower floors lived.

01:00:55.880 --> 01:01:00.440
By the time they found him, he
same with six other girls.

01:01:05.320 --> 01:01:08.080
If I had said anything ...

01:01:18.840 --> 01:01:21.680
It was not your fault.

01:01:26.520 --> 01:01:29.720
I must away from here, Reg.

01:01:51.640 --> 01:01:54.360
You did not listen

01:03:04.360 --> 01:03:07.680
Simon, what is it?

01:03:10.680 --> 01:03:13.640
It took until I was 13.

01:03:18.440 --> 01:03:21.160
When stopped it.

01:03:23.040 --> 01:03:25.720
When I started to believe them.

01:03:26.560 --> 01:03:29.760
Maybe it never happened.

01:03:30.160 --> 01:03:34.120
Maybe I have this gift
never had.

01:03:38.120 --> 01:03:40.760
But when I found you.

01:03:42.920 --> 01:03:45.640
And it started again.

01:03:47.760 --> 01:03:51.000
And it's more intense than ever.

01:03:53.840 --> 01:03:58.000
And I never want to lose.
I will not.

01:04:08.040 --> 01:04:11.080
And I want you not to lose.

01:04:31.360 --> 01:04:34.040
I think it is terrible to go.

01:04:34.640 --> 01:04:36.760
Believe that you do not?

01:04:39.440 --> 01:04:42.600
Let's go.
- Sorry.

01:04:45.760 --> 01:04:48.480
Are you, Mary Florescu?

01:04:48.920 --> 01:04:52.920
Yes, I am.
- Would you please sign for me?

01:04:54.520 --> 01:04:58.280
The soul of Agnes Wishington.

01:04:59.680 --> 01:05:02.800
This is my second copy of
'Visits in the Paranormal. "

01:05:03.040 --> 01:05:06.960
I have the other so often read,
that the pages fell out.

01:05:09.360 --> 01:05:11.480
"I believe with my whole heart ...

01:05:11.720 --> 01:05:14.800
that a parallel universe
living together with those of us'.

01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:17.360
A landscape of souls,
we can not see ...

01:05:17.600 --> 01:05:20.040
stories scream,
that must be told.

01:05:20.280 --> 01:05:22.680
They never forget to be
otherwise ...

01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:26.200
that horrible death. "
- 'It has no meaning.

01:05:26.560 --> 01:05:29.920
And God is just backwards,
to more suffering. "

01:05:31.480 --> 01:05:36.000
Sorry, this is Simon McNeal, works
me one of my projects.

01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:37.480
I understand.

01:05:37.560 --> 01:05:40.360
Then you must also sign.
- Sure.

01:05:42.880 --> 01:05:47.040
Sorry, excuse me a moment.
- I write it here.

01:05:52.240 --> 01:05:54.840
Sorry, my phone was probably
no range.

01:05:56.280 --> 01:05:57.200
What?

01:05:57.680 --> 01:06:00.520
I have not heard.

01:06:00.880 --> 01:06:03.760
Tell me, Nigel.

01:06:06.640 --> 01:06:08.240
Are you sure?

01:06:11.920 --> 01:06:15.520
I find that too.
- Since you must focus on.

01:06:15.840 --> 01:06:17.800
It was nice to meet you.
- Thank you very much.

01:06:38.680 --> 01:06:41.080
Where the hell are you going out?

01:06:51.440 --> 01:06:55.280
So, now we play some
game?

01:06:55.600 --> 01:06:58.280
Have we already done all the time?

01:07:00.600 --> 01:07:02.840
Potassium nitrate.

01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:06.400
Also known as ...

01:07:08.640 --> 01:07:10.240
gunpowder.

01:07:10.440 --> 01:07:14.400
Perfect for things to write on walls,
and spontaneously fire fly.

01:07:15.680 --> 01:07:21.680
And here we have protein. It is
actually a part of protein.

01:07:21.800 --> 01:07:23.600
Sulfa.

01:07:24.480 --> 01:07:26.600
Handsome boy.

01:07:27.640 --> 01:07:31.960
Sulfa and carbon.
Let's see ...

01:07:33.520 --> 01:07:38.240
Yes, as you get from charcoal.
Charcoal for artists.

01:07:38.880 --> 01:07:41.160
Perfect for writing on walls.

01:07:43.720 --> 01:07:45.520
Okay, so ...

01:07:45.960 --> 01:07:49.440
I have some things distorted.
- The tire on my car?

01:07:51.400 --> 01:07:54.920
And the fountain when I was a girl?

01:07:56.280 --> 01:07:59.560
How did you feel?
- I do my homework.

01:08:01.080 --> 01:08:06.360
I tried to tell you, I
wanted to explain, but you did not listen.

01:08:06.440 --> 01:08:09.240
You better leave.
- Listen.

01:08:13.080 --> 01:08:17.880
There is something wrong in this house. Good?

01:08:18.520 --> 01:08:22.600
The first time the top?
Yes, when I pretended.

01:08:23.200 --> 01:08:25.680
But the second time, that was real.

01:08:25.920 --> 01:08:29.240
That went far beyond the few
pieces of charcoal.

01:08:29.479 --> 01:08:33.720
Much more than a boy in
a laboratory coat you could ever tell.

01:08:34.920 --> 01:08:37.399
I thought you were smarter than this, Simon.

01:08:39.640 --> 01:08:41.800
I thought ...

01:08:44.399 --> 01:08:47.960
briefly, that you really were.

01:09:36.520 --> 01:09:39.000
<i> I would not lose you. </ i></i>

01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:52.479
<i> nothing to hide anyway? </ i></i>

01:09:54.960 --> 01:09:58.280
<i> Well, I have some things distorted. </ i></i>

01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:02.120
<i> But the second time, that was real. </ i></i>

01:10:04.440 --> 01:10:07.160
<i> I tried to tell you. </ i></i>

01:10:08.560 --> 01:10:11.080
<i> I wanted to explain to you, but you</i>
would not listen to me. </ i>

01:10:11.200 --> 01:10:14.160
Hold on please!

01:12:49.080 --> 01:12:52.200
If he gunpowder
here received.

01:12:53.840 --> 01:12:55.960
Come on, there is more.

01:13:01.200 --> 01:13:03.960
Pay attention to him.

01:13:04.640 --> 01:13:08.600
Thoughts transfer directly from Houdini.
- If he does it.

01:13:09.560 --> 01:13:11.920
Watch his hand.

01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:19.160
It took a while for
I doorhad.

01:13:21.480 --> 01:13:26.360
Vibration transmitter.
- I thought it was sewn under his mattress.

01:13:26.880 --> 01:13:29.440
He has my lapping equipment.

01:13:29.760 --> 01:13:32.960
I thought I was him with a
removal of the saw.

01:13:33.440 --> 01:13:36.360
He should have paid him, so that
for him to resign.

01:13:37.840 --> 01:13:41.840
God knows what other tricks
he still has.

01:14:02.200 --> 01:14:06.480
I am sorry, I just wanted to be happy
that it were true.

01:14:06.840 --> 01:14:12.440
Forget it. You were just
not yourself.

01:14:13.400 --> 01:14:15.920
You're right, that I was not.

01:14:16.320 --> 01:14:18.440
I was weak, and he was ...

01:14:19.640 --> 01:14:21.680
Hard.

01:14:22.920 --> 01:14:27.240
Little liar.
Cute little liar.

01:14:28.880 --> 01:14:32.080
I really thought that he was special.

01:14:32.800 --> 01:14:35.760
For what it worth,
I thought so too.

01:14:36.320 --> 01:14:40.040
But briefly.

01:14:42.880 --> 01:14:49.280
Let's go to Elliot.
Pizza dinner, house wine.

01:14:50.040 --> 01:14:52.720
That funny little trickster forgotten.

01:14:53.040 --> 01:14:55.120
I am not an imposter.

01:14:55.480 --> 01:14:56.920
Hell here on Thursday.

01:14:57.280 --> 01:15:01.240
You understand it.

01:15:01.400 --> 01:15:04.120
And you'll never understand.

01:15:08.400 --> 01:15:10.960
I hear here.

01:15:11.920 --> 01:15:14.320
This house, that is me.

01:15:14.880 --> 01:15:17.520
It has chosen me, me!

01:15:17.800 --> 01:15:21.000
It is always about you, or not?
Always about you.

01:15:21.360 --> 01:15:23.560
This is about me.

01:15:26.040 --> 01:15:29.040
I told you that I had a gift,
and which is mine removed.

01:15:29.320 --> 01:15:31.320
But I am now back.

01:15:31.600 --> 01:15:35.400
I got it back, and I do not let it
Show me fall.

01:15:35.920 --> 01:15:41.040
So I'm going to show you. I ga the
once and for all evidence.

01:15:42.080 --> 01:15:44.880
You can stop now, Simon.

01:15:51.520 --> 01:15:53.200
Please.

01:15:53.480 --> 01:15:57.840
If I'm ready, you'll beg
my story or you may have.

01:15:58.200 --> 01:16:01.640
And it will be greater than any other book
you have written. You know why?

01:16:03.600 --> 01:16:04.960
Because all true.

01:16:05.880 --> 01:16:09.680
Well. You write it.

01:16:21.840 --> 01:16:25.080
Well, no truckjes.

01:16:41.400 --> 01:16:44.520
We can not here him
just leave.

01:16:46.120 --> 01:16:50.120
Why we call the police,
and tell them that there is a burglar.

01:17:36.280 --> 01:17:39.040
Little bastard, not again.

01:19:02.800 --> 01:19:04.840
You have to hear.

01:19:12.240 --> 01:19:15.000
We are in the middle of an intersection.

01:19:15.280 --> 01:19:17.000
I understand now.

01:19:18.280 --> 01:19:22.600
That is what this house is.
A crossroads of the deceased.

01:19:26.760 --> 01:19:29.680
The dead have highways.

01:19:29.960 --> 01:19:32.720
Highways leading to crossings.

01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:36.200
Highways in our world flows.

01:20:06.040 --> 01:20:09.160
He has led us to a cross.

01:20:09.480 --> 01:20:11.760
He is not the one who does.

01:20:13.640 --> 01:20:15.640
You're it.

01:20:25.800 --> 01:20:27.760
Stop.

01:22:58.200 --> 01:23:00.800
Tell them that you will listen.

01:23:01.560 --> 01:23:03.680
Where to listen?

01:23:34.880 --> 01:23:37.840
You understand it really, do you?

01:23:46.400 --> 01:23:48.680
They have waited ...

01:23:53.600 --> 01:23:56.160
someone who will listen.

01:24:00.360 --> 01:24:03.480
On someone who will hear their stories.

01:24:20.720 --> 01:24:23.960
I promised that we will listen.

01:24:25.080 --> 01:24:28.520
And I will give you stories
to the world.

01:26:00.640 --> 01:26:03.200
<i> She had made them a promise. </ i></i>

01:26:03.680 --> 01:26:07.440
<i> a promise that I should keep. </ i></i>

01:26:15.960 --> 01:26:20.000
<i> And their stories were coming.</i>
Day after day ...</ i>

01:26:21.200 --> 01:26:23.920
<i> night after night. </ i></i>

01:26:31.080 --> 01:26:35.480
<i> They had me locked up in</i>
that country that they had purchased. </ i>

01:26:36.400 --> 01:26:40.240
<i> With all the money they</i>
of her books earned. </ i>

01:26:42.320 --> 01:26:45.240
My skin <i> reading. </ i></i>

01:27:55.920 --> 01:27:58.480
Let us continue.

01:28:19.960 --> 01:28:23.240
She said that I would be their book.

01:28:24.760 --> 01:28:27.920
And it would be their interpreter.

01:28:29.680 --> 01:28:33.400
Write their stories.

01:28:36.640 --> 01:28:42.760
The stories they wrote on me.

01:28:46.600 --> 01:28:49.480
But I could not anymore.

01:28:51.520 --> 01:28:54.120
So I'm away.

01:28:55.480 --> 01:28:58.680
I ran and I ran ...

01:29:02.320 --> 01:29:05.920
But they were writing.

01:29:11.040 --> 01:29:14.160
And they kept writing.

01:29:16.600 --> 01:29:18.800
You know what?

01:29:20.280 --> 01:29:25.600
You tell a good story, my friend. But I
regret to say that I am not moved.

01:29:26.840 --> 01:29:30.640
I feel nothing.

01:29:36.440 --> 01:29:38.880
Be fast.

01:30:16.840 --> 01:30:19.960
Have you money? Of course.

01:30:20.640 --> 01:30:24.560
Nicely done.
Suitable for Freeman.

01:31:10.320 --> 01:31:12.840
<i> The stories go on. </ i></i>

01:31:17.520 --> 01:31:19.640
Who's there?

01:31:30.600 --> 01:31:32.680
What ...

01:32:07.840 --> 01:32:10.680
Help me.

01:34:49.560 --> 01:34:52.160
The stories go on.

01:34:53.760 --> 01:34:56.680
<i> They bleed and bleed. </ i></i>

01:35:11.000 --> 01:35:14.000
The deceased have <i> highways. </ i></i>

01:35:14.040 --> 01:35:16.560
<i> Only the person who lives lost. </ i></i>

01:35:16.760 --> 01:35:18.920
<i> But there are signs and bridges ...</ i></i>

01:35:19.120 --> 01:35:22.280
<i> where the deceased will stop</i>
for you to tell their stories. </ i>

01:35:22.520 --> 01:35:25.680
<i> Because telling them deliver</i>
of the story. </ i>

01:35:25.920 --> 01:35:29.520
<i> And it is just best to listen. </ i></i>
