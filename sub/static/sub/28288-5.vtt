WEBVTT

00:01.454 --> 00:04.413
You want to use my love
to save your love?!

00:04.457 --> 00:06.590
Very well.
I'll spare his life.

00:06.633 --> 00:07.678
No!

00:07.721 --> 00:09.462
And take
yours instead.

00:09.505 --> 00:10.787
Pascale believes
you killed Queen Joan.

00:12.247 --> 00:13.647
See him to the dungeon.

00:13.684 --> 00:16.425
Tell me Landry's head is
on a pike somewhere.

00:16.469 --> 00:18.645
Landry, go see your daughter
before King Philip

00:18.689 --> 00:20.212
removes the chance
from your hands.

00:20.255 --> 00:22.301
Farewell,
my brothers.

00:22.344 --> 00:23.737
They killed my husband,

00:23.781 --> 00:25.783
they took my baby,
and they slit his throat.

00:25.826 --> 00:27.132
The Templars
will pay for this.

00:27.175 --> 00:28.742
Prince Louis.
You're the one who...

00:28.786 --> 00:29.961
Shh, shh!

00:30.004 --> 00:31.527
What's happened
to you?

00:31.571 --> 00:34.313
I'm no longer burdened
by troubled thoughts.

00:34.356 --> 00:37.055
You once swore loyalty
to the Templars.

00:37.098 --> 00:39.666
How can I trust you'll be loyal
to my father and I?

00:41.000 --> 00:47.074

00:48.980 --> 00:51.722
- What is the meaning of this?
- Landry.

01:03.211 --> 01:05.997
You had Landry
in your grasp,

01:06.040 --> 01:08.086
yet return
with empty hands?

01:08.129 --> 01:09.740
The man's
quite formidable.

01:09.783 --> 01:11.698
How could you let
the man escape?

01:11.742 --> 01:12.960
How could you
let him...

01:13.004 --> 01:15.659
Do not
fucking speak!

01:18.705 --> 01:21.099
You have
unfinished business,

01:21.142 --> 01:23.928
which I would see
completed directly.

01:23.971 --> 01:26.713
Yes, father.

01:29.368 --> 01:31.283
Everyone out.

01:34.460 --> 01:39.726
I provided you with a purpose,
with a life,

01:39.770 --> 01:44.557
yet you repay my generosity
with nothing.

01:44.600 --> 01:47.691
De Nogaret,
alert Sir Gerard

01:47.734 --> 01:49.693
Gawain is no longer Marshal
of my men-at-arms.

01:49.736 --> 01:51.259
My Lord?

01:51.303 --> 01:53.914
You failed me,
and this is the result.

01:53.958 --> 01:55.611
I'll prove
my worth to you.

01:55.655 --> 01:59.267
Get him
out of my sight.

01:59.311 --> 02:02.880
I know my way out!

02:02.923 --> 02:05.491
De Nogaret.

02:05.534 --> 02:06.927
Your Majesty?

02:06.971 --> 02:09.103
Have Sir Gerard
ready my army.

02:09.146 --> 02:11.758
We are to march on the Templars
at Chartres and attack.

02:11.802 --> 02:13.804
With respect,
Your Majesty,

02:13.847 --> 02:16.502
the Pope is still aligned
with the Templars.

02:16.545 --> 02:17.827
As I have warned you,
if you proceed...

02:17.851 --> 02:19.679
I am tired of your warnings,
De Nogaret.

02:19.723 --> 02:22.421
But the case is
nearly ironclad!

02:25.032 --> 02:28.514
You would raise
your voice to me?

02:28.557 --> 02:31.125
You forget your place.

02:31.169 --> 02:33.998
Your Majesty, you employ me
to give you counsel,

02:34.041 --> 02:36.783
and counsel
I shall give.

02:36.827 --> 02:39.830
Now, if you will allow me,
I have but a few items left.

02:39.873 --> 02:41.788
However, should you
attack them prematurely,

02:41.832 --> 02:43.374
you could risk breaking
the laws of the state...

02:43.398 --> 02:47.141
I am the state!

02:47.185 --> 02:48.752
And as God's
holy ruler,

02:48.795 --> 02:53.757
it is time I demonstrated
my power and might.

02:53.800 --> 02:57.630
We attack them presently,
legal case be damned.

03:12.993 --> 03:14.623
I have something
that will help your case.

03:14.647 --> 03:15.929
Oh, have you become
my advocate now?

03:15.953 --> 03:18.303
I'm more
than just a savage.

03:18.346 --> 03:21.697
I'm a former Templar,
the reason you sought me out.

03:21.741 --> 03:23.787
I know
all of their secrets

03:23.830 --> 03:26.615
and where those secrets
are hidden.

03:32.447 --> 03:33.797
Eat.

03:33.840 --> 03:35.450
No.

03:35.494 --> 03:37.757
Eat.

03:37.801 --> 03:40.760
I won't.

03:40.804 --> 03:42.240
Why are you
keeping me here?

03:42.283 --> 03:43.937
Why don't you
just kill me

03:43.981 --> 03:48.115
like you killed
my husband and son?

03:48.159 --> 03:52.206
Why would I kill you?

03:53.773 --> 03:56.950
You haven't
done anything to me.

03:56.994 --> 03:59.387
Please.

03:59.431 --> 04:02.738
Put me
out of my misery.

04:02.782 --> 04:04.392
No.

04:04.436 --> 04:06.612
You serve
a larger purpose.

04:06.655 --> 04:09.833
As what? A prisoner?

04:09.876 --> 04:11.791
Your slave?

04:11.835 --> 04:14.228
You may be in chains,
but you are no slave.

04:14.272 --> 04:17.188
Then what am I?

04:21.757 --> 04:28.757
When you were younger, what did
you think your life would be?

04:28.852 --> 04:33.291
I imagined a life where I'd love
my husband and raise my son.

04:35.771 --> 04:40.298
But you took that
from me.

04:40.341 --> 04:45.956
You won't kill me,
but you've taken my life.

04:45.999 --> 04:49.437
Many things
are taken from us.

04:54.747 --> 04:57.315
I won't be long.

05:01.972 --> 05:04.888
My Lord.

05:04.931 --> 05:06.890
You have news
about the Templars?

05:06.933 --> 05:09.066
I've heard rumor
that Templars are killing

05:09.109 --> 05:11.329
the newly born,
an act I believe

05:11.372 --> 05:13.940
recently occurred
at the Holy Sisters Convent

05:13.984 --> 05:16.377
- outside Chartres.
- Chartres?

05:16.421 --> 05:18.684
I saw a Templar
enter the convent

05:18.727 --> 05:22.340
on more than one occasion,
a convent known

05:22.383 --> 05:25.256
to care
for cast-off infants.

05:25.299 --> 05:27.214
And when
did this happen?

05:27.258 --> 05:31.305
Perhaps a few weeks ago,
maybe a month, my Lord.

05:31.349 --> 05:33.046
Thank you.

05:33.090 --> 05:34.874
Hmm.

05:34.918 --> 05:37.877
This act of savagery
will be dealt with.

05:37.921 --> 05:40.271
My Lord.
Hmm.

05:50.542 --> 05:52.022
There isn't any record

05:52.065 --> 05:54.459
of a child being baptized
from that convent.

05:57.941 --> 05:59.551
Unless...

06:02.554 --> 06:05.383
Prepare the horses.

06:05.426 --> 06:08.690
There is more prey
to be hunted.

06:12.259 --> 06:14.566
She's been here
this whole time?

06:14.609 --> 06:17.830
I left Eve with the only person
I trust to keep her safe.

06:21.877 --> 06:23.618
What if
this is a mistake?

06:23.662 --> 06:25.446
What if I'm not meant
to be a father?

06:25.490 --> 06:27.492
But you are a father.

06:27.535 --> 06:30.799
It's a blessing some of us
will never experience.

07:03.528 --> 07:08.098
We're honored by your presence,
Your Holiness.

07:08.141 --> 07:09.969
I speak for all of us
when I tell you

07:10.013 --> 07:12.450
how delighted we were by your
election as our newest Pontiff.

07:12.493 --> 07:13.973
Thank you,
Grandmaster.

07:14.017 --> 07:15.583
Please.

07:23.113 --> 07:27.030
Jesus' first miracle was turning
water into wine, my son.

07:27.073 --> 07:31.425
Then wine it shall be.

07:31.469 --> 07:34.341
I've ascended
to St. Peter's throne

07:34.385 --> 07:36.822
and would see you Templars
restored to your former glory.

07:36.865 --> 07:37.997
Your Holiness?

07:38.041 --> 07:39.520
You've become
complacent.

07:39.564 --> 07:41.107
You spend your days focused
on bank ledgers

07:41.131 --> 07:43.133
when you should be
wielding steel instead.

07:43.176 --> 07:44.719
In the coming days,
I'm going to issue orders

07:44.743 --> 07:48.138
that you embark on a new crusade
to the Holy Land.

07:48.181 --> 07:50.270
We must push the infidels
out of Jerusalem

07:50.314 --> 07:52.968
and reclaim
what is ours.

07:53.012 --> 07:56.015
Nothing would please me more,
Your Holiness,

07:56.059 --> 07:58.409
but do you really think
that's wise?

07:58.452 --> 08:00.063
Why wouldn't it be?

08:00.106 --> 08:02.761
With the greatest respect,
Your Holiness,

08:02.804 --> 08:04.719
we have a king who has
declared us his enemy,

08:04.763 --> 08:06.330
and rumors abound that
he's responsible

08:06.373 --> 08:08.288
for your
predecessor's death.

08:08.332 --> 08:09.985
To embark
on another...

08:10.029 --> 08:12.814
Push away any concern you have
about King Philip

08:12.858 --> 08:15.687
and turn mind toward
the more important task.

08:15.730 --> 08:18.124
God has ordained
the Knights Templar

08:18.168 --> 08:21.258
as his executioners, and I would
have you act as such.

08:21.301 --> 08:23.738
As God's humble servant,
I would have you spread word

08:23.782 --> 08:25.958
to every Templar temple
of my wishes

08:26.001 --> 08:28.395
to return
to the Holy Land.

08:28.439 --> 08:30.093
And King Philip?

08:30.136 --> 08:31.964
Leave him to me.

08:32.006 --> 08:36.316
Your wisdom both honors us
and guides us, Your Holiness.

08:36.360 --> 08:39.145
It is God's wisdom
that guides me.

08:39.188 --> 08:45.586
As it will continue
to guide us all.

08:45.630 --> 08:47.806
I can do that for you,
my Lady.

08:47.849 --> 08:50.765
I am aware of what you can
and cannot do.

08:50.809 --> 08:52.898
But I know
my husband.

08:52.941 --> 08:55.248
And I know what he likes
and what he needs right now.

08:55.292 --> 08:58.817
I'm capable of doing this
myself, thank you.

08:58.860 --> 09:01.298
But what you can do is tell me
where my husband is.

09:01.341 --> 09:03.387
He's often at the Temple,
my Lady.

09:03.430 --> 09:04.866
Is he?

09:04.910 --> 09:07.217
Would you like me
to call him for you?

09:07.260 --> 09:10.133
No. No.

09:10.176 --> 09:12.352
I'll...

09:12.396 --> 09:14.267
I'll visit him instead.

09:18.489 --> 09:20.795
Ah, there you are!

09:31.937 --> 09:35.288
I never would have guessed
Eve's father was a Templar.

09:40.163 --> 09:42.513
Come, Landry.

09:42.556 --> 09:44.689
Play with
your daughter.

10:02.707 --> 10:05.666
I understand Eve's mother's
no longer with us.

10:08.974 --> 10:10.715
No.

10:10.758 --> 10:13.544
No, she was
a remarkable woman.

10:13.587 --> 10:16.329
And she's missed.

10:16.373 --> 10:18.810
I'm sorry.

10:27.210 --> 10:28.820
Forgive
the intrusion,

10:28.863 --> 10:30.996
but some of your fellow Templars
have arrived.

10:31.039 --> 10:32.737
Would you like me
to welcome them?

10:32.780 --> 10:35.218
Uh, no thank you,
Mother Superior.

10:35.261 --> 10:39.134
We'll, uh... We'll welcome
these brothers ourselves.

11:02.680 --> 11:05.857
Greetings, brothers.

11:11.341 --> 11:13.908
Forgive
our surprise.

11:13.952 --> 11:15.277
We were expecting to see some
of our own Templar brothers.

11:15.301 --> 11:16.607
Of course.

11:16.650 --> 11:18.261
What brings you
so far from...?

11:18.304 --> 11:20.132
- Arville.
- Arville?

11:20.175 --> 11:22.439
That's quite
a distance.

11:22.482 --> 11:26.486
There's been rumor of a Templar
frequenting this convent,

11:26.530 --> 11:31.012
engaging
in unspeakable acts.

11:31.056 --> 11:34.015
What
unspeakable acts?

11:39.412 --> 11:42.589
Identify yourselves.

11:42.633 --> 11:44.306
If neither of you
are the Templar I speak of,

11:44.330 --> 11:46.376
you have nothing
to fear.

11:46.419 --> 11:48.943
My name is
Tancrede de Hautville.

11:48.987 --> 11:51.250
I'm
Landry du Lauzon.

12:00.259 --> 12:03.480
Brother, why would you draw
your sword on a fellow Templar?

12:03.523 --> 12:05.395
Because
I know that horse.

12:05.438 --> 12:08.398
And because Templars
carry swords, not crossbows.

12:08.441 --> 12:11.444
And because you
are not Templars.

12:13.359 --> 12:15.622
Kill them!

12:15.666 --> 12:17.450
Inside!

12:20.801 --> 12:22.499
Get yourselves
to safety.

12:22.542 --> 12:23.650
Tell the rest
of your sisters.

12:23.674 --> 12:26.503
Find a room,
lock the door.

12:26.546 --> 12:28.592
- Let's go.
- I'm not leaving.

12:28.635 --> 12:29.810
There's no time, Anne.

12:29.854 --> 12:31.551
Tancrede,
this is my home.

12:31.595 --> 12:32.833
Dangerous men impersonating
Templars are here.

12:32.857 --> 12:34.467
We have to
leave, Anne.

12:34.511 --> 12:37.340
Anne, please.

12:37.383 --> 12:39.298
Come on.
All right.

12:42.345 --> 12:44.259
Get the horses.
Take the road to Chartres.

12:44.303 --> 12:45.826
We'll be
right behind you.

12:47.480 --> 12:49.134
Go.

13:30.001 --> 13:32.873
I'm gonna kill you,
and then your baby!

13:58.159 --> 14:02.033
Hurry.
Hurry up.

14:02.076 --> 14:04.775
Who are you?
I've done nothing to you!

14:04.818 --> 14:06.777
Oh but you have,
Landry.

14:29.887 --> 14:31.758
Prince Louis!

14:38.591 --> 14:40.680
They're getting away
with the baby!

14:40.724 --> 14:43.074
Give me the horse!
Kill the Templar!

15:27.161 --> 15:28.815
Landry!

15:28.859 --> 15:30.817
We have to go.

15:44.091 --> 15:46.529
Landry, come on.

16:20.171 --> 16:23.522
Anne! Anne!

16:23.566 --> 16:26.133
They must have
come through here somewhere.

16:37.580 --> 16:39.364
I'm finally
reunited with Eve

16:39.407 --> 16:43.629
only to have her ripped
from my grasp.

16:43.673 --> 16:45.544
I knew it was a mistake
coming to see her.

16:45.588 --> 16:49.330
Eve would be dead had we not.
Anne and Grecia, as well.

16:49.374 --> 16:51.942
How in God's name
could that bastard Prince Louis

16:51.985 --> 16:54.771
do such a thing,
hunting an innocent child?

16:54.814 --> 16:57.904
Philip must have found out
that Eve was still alive,

16:57.948 --> 17:00.428
dispatched Louis
to kill her.

17:00.472 --> 17:02.474
We'll make sure
he doesn't.

17:02.517 --> 17:04.781
Come on.

17:13.616 --> 17:15.574
Hup! Hup!

17:15.617 --> 17:19.622
Hyah! Hyah!

17:23.669 --> 17:25.691
This is how you're gonna help me
destroy the Templars?

17:25.714 --> 17:27.934
With elixirs and
scented oils?

17:27.978 --> 17:29.762
What are
we doing here?

17:29.806 --> 17:32.373
The Templars have always been an
order shrouded in mystery.

17:32.417 --> 17:35.681
Then by all means,
enlighten me.

17:35.725 --> 17:37.683
One of the founders
and first Templar Grandmaster

17:37.727 --> 17:41.948
was Hugh de Payens,
the son of Theobald of Blois.

17:41.992 --> 17:45.082
The Knight who conspired
against King Henry I?

17:45.125 --> 17:46.257
One and the same.

17:46.300 --> 17:49.390
And this helps me how?

17:49.434 --> 17:51.523
The Templars are renown
for having great respect

17:51.566 --> 17:54.047
for their
founding members,

17:54.091 --> 17:55.764
and no one's more important
than Hugh de Payens.

17:55.788 --> 17:57.268
Well, how important?

17:57.311 --> 18:00.401
The man's no longer regarded
as just a man.

18:00.445 --> 18:03.317
He's been elevated
to mythical status.

18:03.361 --> 18:07.495
In fact, the Templars
don't just worship God.

18:07.539 --> 18:09.846
They worship him,
as well.

18:09.889 --> 18:11.630
Just as there have
always been rumors

18:11.674 --> 18:14.198
of the Templars
worshipping idols,

18:14.241 --> 18:18.419
I know where to find
those idols.

18:18.463 --> 18:22.075
Is this real, or did you just
make all of this up?

18:22.119 --> 18:25.557
Do you want to destroy
the Templars or not?

18:32.825 --> 18:37.264
Louis? Louis?

19:02.725 --> 19:04.770
Who's there?

19:07.207 --> 19:11.385
Step into the light.

19:11.429 --> 19:15.520
I promise you
no harm will come to you.

19:26.531 --> 19:28.359
Princess Margaret.

19:28.402 --> 19:32.580
What are you doing
in here?

19:32.624 --> 19:34.974
Why are you wearing
one of my gowns?

19:35.018 --> 19:36.715
Your husband
gave it to me.

19:36.759 --> 19:38.804
Why would he do that?

19:38.848 --> 19:42.939
He wants me to feel special
after everything I've endured.

19:42.982 --> 19:46.725
Endured?

19:46.769 --> 19:48.901
Who are you?

19:48.945 --> 19:51.817
Um, my name is Lydia.

19:51.861 --> 19:54.515
Why are you here,
Lydia?

19:54.559 --> 19:59.477
Because I had a husband
and a baby son.

19:59.520 --> 20:04.787
And your husband
took them away from me.

20:04.830 --> 20:06.571
My Lord.

20:11.010 --> 20:13.230
What infernal mischief
is this?

20:13.273 --> 20:15.058
Eudes has developed
this particular weapon

20:15.101 --> 20:17.190
for your Royal Army,
Your Majesty.

20:17.234 --> 20:19.889
Inside the cone is
a powerful, black powder

20:19.932 --> 20:22.369
that combusts
when joined with fire.

20:22.413 --> 20:24.371
- Combusts?
- Yes, Your Majesty.

20:24.415 --> 20:26.417
An explosion so powerful
that even the thick walls

20:26.460 --> 20:28.898
of Chartres Temple
will crumble.

20:28.941 --> 20:30.856
You seem confident.

20:30.900 --> 20:32.858
Very, my Lord.

20:32.902 --> 20:34.947
Please, allow me
to show you its power.

21:02.540 --> 21:04.847
Good God.

21:04.890 --> 21:07.545
Have we
the necessary supply

21:07.588 --> 21:09.460
to bring Chartres Temple
to the ground?

21:09.503 --> 21:11.462
We do, Your Majesty.

21:11.505 --> 21:13.420
Good.

21:22.038 --> 21:25.911
Gerard, my patience
has grown thin.

21:25.955 --> 21:28.218
Alert the army.

21:28.261 --> 21:30.785
We march tonight.

21:30.829 --> 21:32.352
My Lord.

21:54.461 --> 22:01.338
Prince Louis, we have to
take you back to the palace.

22:01.381 --> 22:06.430
I'm not
going anywhere.

22:06.473 --> 22:09.824
My father ordered me
to find Landry and his child

22:09.868 --> 22:12.044
and kill them.

22:12.088 --> 22:15.439
And nothing will prevent me
from completing that task.

23:21.679 --> 23:25.291
Shouldn't we keep moving?
Someone will find us here.

23:25.335 --> 23:28.251
King Philip expelled all
the Jews from France last year.

23:28.294 --> 23:31.210
No one's coming to worship here
anytime soon.

23:31.254 --> 23:32.733
We'll spend
the night here,

23:32.777 --> 23:37.086
and we'll go
to Chartres tomorrow.

23:45.268 --> 23:46.921
Because I had a husband.

23:55.756 --> 23:57.845
And a baby son.

23:57.889 --> 23:59.804
And your husband
took them away from me.

23:59.847 --> 24:02.328
Aaaah!!

26:18.551 --> 26:22.381
If you look close enough...

26:22.425 --> 26:25.384
the truth will
reveal itself to you.

26:40.312 --> 26:42.488
Hyah! Hyah!

26:44.664 --> 26:46.666
Shh. Shh.

26:46.710 --> 26:48.233
I fed her.
She should be asleep.

26:48.277 --> 26:51.889
Hey. Shh.
You should be sleeping.

27:01.899 --> 27:03.466
Quick.

27:19.612 --> 27:24.313
Anne?

27:24.356 --> 27:27.533
Tancrede?

27:27.577 --> 27:29.796
Landry.

27:29.840 --> 27:33.235
Tancrede was right to entrust
you with my daughter.

27:33.278 --> 27:34.410
Both of you,
thank you.

27:34.453 --> 27:36.455
You're welcome.

27:36.499 --> 27:38.588
Would you like
to hold her?

27:48.380 --> 27:51.427
Hello.

27:51.470 --> 27:55.300
Hey.

27:55.344 --> 27:58.260
Hi.
How are you?

27:58.303 --> 28:01.959
Hello.

28:02.002 --> 28:03.221
What do I do now?

28:03.265 --> 28:04.483
Nothing.

28:13.797 --> 28:18.149
You can never go back there.

28:18.192 --> 28:21.457
But that convent was my life.
It was my family.

28:21.500 --> 28:24.590
I'm so sorry.

28:24.634 --> 28:25.983
I brought this
upon you.

28:26.026 --> 28:28.377
Tancrede.

28:28.420 --> 28:35.209
I should never have brought
the child to you.

28:35.253 --> 28:36.907
It's brought you
nothing but pain.

28:36.950 --> 28:39.388
And you.

28:39.431 --> 28:43.435
You back
into my life.

28:43.479 --> 28:45.611
I don't blame you,
Tancrede.

28:45.655 --> 28:48.527
I could
never blame you.

28:48.571 --> 28:50.355
I blame Prince Louis
and King Philip,

28:50.399 --> 28:52.314
for they alone have
taken everything from me.

28:52.357 --> 28:54.141
Everything.

28:58.798 --> 29:00.974
Not everything.

29:03.890 --> 29:06.415
Anne.

29:12.334 --> 29:15.946
You're a Templar.

29:15.989 --> 29:18.514
I'm a nun.

29:44.191 --> 29:46.280
This is the downfall
of the Templars,

29:46.324 --> 29:49.936
a silver,
two-headed skull?

29:49.980 --> 29:53.157
This is more
than just a silver skull.

29:53.200 --> 29:55.768
This is one
of their false idols.

29:55.812 --> 29:59.337
The visage of Hugh de Payens
on one side

29:59.381 --> 30:02.949
and Baphomet, the fallen angel,
on the other.

30:02.993 --> 30:07.389
Together, they represent
Heaven and Hell.

30:07.432 --> 30:12.089
And the only people who would
have this... are heretics.

30:12.132 --> 30:17.529
Yes.

30:17.573 --> 30:20.489
You surprise me,
Gawain.

30:20.532 --> 30:22.012
There really is
more to you

30:22.055 --> 30:25.537
than being a swordsman,
isn't there?

30:25.581 --> 30:28.061
I've always lived
by Sun-Tzu's credo...

30:28.105 --> 30:30.716
"Keep your friends close
and your enemies closer."

30:30.760 --> 30:34.720
But I look at you,
and it makes me wonder...

30:34.764 --> 30:36.461
which one are you?

31:03.662 --> 31:06.491
Have you shared your thoughts
with her?

31:09.538 --> 31:13.585
Not in words.

31:13.629 --> 31:15.892
I'm such a fool.

31:15.935 --> 31:18.285
No.
You're a man.

31:18.329 --> 31:19.741
Rarely do we
time things appropriately

31:19.765 --> 31:22.464
when the heart's
involved.

31:22.507 --> 31:24.466
We're such beasts,
aren't we?

31:24.509 --> 31:29.819
The most wretched.

31:29.862 --> 31:35.259
You regret
seeing your daughter again?

31:35.302 --> 31:37.087
No.

31:37.130 --> 31:41.439
There's nothing I regret
about being her father.

31:44.268 --> 31:49.926
What?

31:49.969 --> 31:52.537
Every time I look at her,
I'm reminded of

31:52.581 --> 31:56.106
what she'll never have...
who she'll never have.

31:56.149 --> 31:59.022
Queen Joan.

31:59.065 --> 32:05.550
Never have her to...
laugh and cry with.

32:05.594 --> 32:08.466
Never see her smile.

32:08.510 --> 32:10.947
And neither
will her eldest son.

32:14.603 --> 32:16.039
Louis.

32:16.082 --> 32:20.609
Prince... Louis.

32:20.652 --> 32:22.828
Give me the child.No.

32:22.872 --> 32:24.569
You know I've been
searching for you

32:24.613 --> 32:26.702
and your bastard
for some time.

32:26.745 --> 32:29.008
Now give me the child.

32:29.052 --> 32:32.185
You'll have to kill me
before I give her up again.

32:32.229 --> 32:34.710
Her?

32:38.017 --> 32:42.195
All this time,
my father thought you had a son.

32:42.239 --> 32:47.592
But just like a Templar,
to sire a bitch instead.

33:13.313 --> 33:15.620
Stay with them!

33:33.899 --> 33:36.685
You surprise me, Landry.

33:36.728 --> 33:41.167
Addressing me
with such familiarity.

33:41.211 --> 33:44.649
Tell me... Is that how you
addressed my mother,

33:44.693 --> 33:47.478
like she were
a common whore?

33:47.521 --> 33:51.264
Oh, I-I longed to meet you
in person.

33:53.484 --> 33:55.573
I even prayed for it.

33:58.184 --> 34:00.622
And here you are.

34:00.665 --> 34:03.755
God has answered
my prayers.

34:03.799 --> 34:05.539
Come out
and face me.

34:12.024 --> 34:17.768
And lay eyes on the man
that defiled my mother?

34:17.813 --> 34:21.120
Drop the sword.

34:21.164 --> 34:25.168
Drop it.

34:25.210 --> 34:29.215
My father spoke to me
about you.

34:29.259 --> 34:32.784
Said he saw glimpses
of me in you.

34:32.828 --> 34:34.960
I'm nothing like you.

34:35.004 --> 34:38.224
Did we both
not love my mother?

34:38.268 --> 34:42.054
Did we both not worship
under her altar?

34:42.098 --> 34:44.882
Yes.

34:44.927 --> 34:46.755
I think you and I could have
been brothers.

34:46.797 --> 34:49.453
I would never have been
kin to you.

34:49.496 --> 34:52.411
Perhaps you're right.

34:52.456 --> 34:55.719
I'm a prince,
and you're nothing more

34:55.764 --> 34:59.637
than a fool who sleeps
with another man's wife.

34:59.681 --> 35:01.726
Another man's mother.

35:01.770 --> 35:03.728
But I have paid
for that mistake.

35:03.772 --> 35:06.209
Have you?

35:06.252 --> 35:08.646
Are you still
not a Templar?

35:08.690 --> 35:10.735
Afforded
such privileges

35:10.779 --> 35:14.478
that come from
the most holy order?

35:14.521 --> 35:17.829
My mother lost her life
because of you,

35:17.873 --> 35:21.790
and yet you still stand here,
still drawing breath,

35:21.833 --> 35:26.185
still shrouded in that cloak
of piety and honor!

35:28.840 --> 35:33.105
And just as the Father
sent His beloved Son

35:33.149 --> 35:37.240
to cast the fallen angels
out of Heaven,

35:37.283 --> 35:39.329
my father
has sent me.

35:39.372 --> 35:43.289
Killing my daughter is not gonna
bring your mother back.

35:43.333 --> 35:47.206
But it will bring you
as much pain and sorrow

35:47.250 --> 35:49.165
as my mother's death
has brought me.

35:49.208 --> 35:54.953
I mourn Joan's death...
every day!

35:54.997 --> 35:57.739
I loved her!
I love her still!

35:57.782 --> 36:00.916
And I would have gladly
given my life instead of hers!

36:00.959 --> 36:03.309
Why would you mourn her
when you're the man

36:03.353 --> 36:07.792
who robbed her
of life?

36:07.836 --> 36:12.841
I didn't kill
your mother.

36:12.884 --> 36:15.757
Your father did.

36:15.800 --> 36:20.109
In front
of his entire army.

36:20.152 --> 36:23.112
No. No. You lie!
You lie!

36:23.155 --> 36:25.723
No.

36:25.767 --> 36:28.421
My father loved her.

36:28.465 --> 36:30.510
He isn't capable of...

36:30.554 --> 36:33.383
of committing such a vile
and disgusting act.

36:33.426 --> 36:35.385
Isn't he?

36:35.428 --> 36:38.257
Look at you.

36:38.301 --> 36:42.435
Your father has sent
his eldest son

36:42.479 --> 36:46.788
and the future King of France
to kill an innocent child.

36:46.831 --> 36:51.357
What kind of a man
willingly sacrifices

36:51.401 --> 36:53.533
his son's soul
by commanding him

36:53.577 --> 36:57.233
to act in such
an unforgivable way?

37:02.151 --> 37:04.544
No. No!

37:04.588 --> 37:07.852
You are responsible
for my mother's death!

37:07.896 --> 37:10.115
And you will pay
for your sins!

37:48.762 --> 37:50.764
Your Majesty.

37:50.808 --> 37:52.941
Raymond.

37:58.903 --> 38:00.925
Raymond, I've just been informed
of something very troubling

38:00.949 --> 38:03.081
concerning
the Knights Templar.

38:03.125 --> 38:04.953
What is it,
Your Majesty?

38:04.996 --> 38:07.651
I think it best
if I show you instead.

38:12.961 --> 38:14.266
We've discovered
something

38:14.310 --> 38:16.399
that proves the Templars
are heretics.

38:16.442 --> 38:18.314
Heretics?

38:18.357 --> 38:20.446
Please.
The Templars are men of God.

38:20.490 --> 38:22.187
Their faith in Him
is incontrovertible.

38:22.231 --> 38:24.276
True, the Templars
do purport themselves to be

38:24.320 --> 38:27.540
men of God...
but that is a lie.

38:27.584 --> 38:30.456
Gawain?

38:30.500 --> 38:33.416
How so, De Nogaret?

38:33.459 --> 38:35.089
We have discovered
the Templars worship something

38:35.113 --> 38:37.376
other than God.

38:45.776 --> 38:48.561
Open it.

38:48.605 --> 38:50.520
What is this?

38:54.393 --> 38:57.353
An idol.

38:57.396 --> 39:03.663
Hugh de Payens,
the first Templar Grandmaster,

39:03.707 --> 39:08.103
and the fallen angel
Baphomet.

39:08.146 --> 39:11.671
Preposterous.

39:11.715 --> 39:13.151
Yet true nonetheless.

39:13.195 --> 39:15.849
Gawain used to be
a Templar brother himself

39:15.893 --> 39:17.590
before he turned away
from the order

39:17.634 --> 39:19.288
due to
their heretical ways.

39:19.331 --> 39:22.769
- Is that true, Gawain?
- It is, Your Holiness.

39:25.859 --> 39:30.777
Apparently, I was blind,
but now I see.

39:30.821 --> 39:33.017
I would have the Templars
explain themselves before God's

39:33.041 --> 39:35.086
most holy representatives
on Earth...

39:35.130 --> 39:38.437
Your Majesty...
and myself.

39:57.108 --> 39:59.110
Open the gate.

39:59.154 --> 40:02.026
Open the fucking gate,
or you'll join the man inside!

40:22.307 --> 40:24.353
Pascale.

40:34.450 --> 40:37.496
You used to serve
in my father's army,

40:37.540 --> 40:39.344
and you saw something
in the forest of Versailles.

40:39.368 --> 40:42.458
What was it?

40:42.501 --> 40:47.637
Tell me what happened
to the queen.

40:47.680 --> 40:51.336
I promise you,
if you tell me the truth,

40:51.380 --> 40:53.556
when I become king,
I will restore your lands

40:53.599 --> 40:56.646
and set you free.

41:01.042 --> 41:05.002
You need something
to write with?

41:39.645 --> 41:46.645
Does the crown represent
the king, my father?

41:47.175 --> 41:52.702
Did my father,
King Philip...

41:55.618 --> 42:01.624
kill... my mother,
Queen Joan?

43:07.733 --> 43:09.213
Women in our Temple?

43:09.257 --> 43:11.302
You've brought women
into our Temple.

43:11.346 --> 43:12.912
Have you lost
your minds?

43:12.956 --> 43:14.716
With respect, Grandmaster,
Sister Anne and Grecia

43:14.740 --> 43:16.612
had nowhere else
to go.

43:16.655 --> 43:18.329
They're innocent, Grandmaster.
They must be protected.

43:18.353 --> 43:19.919
And they will be.

43:19.963 --> 43:22.835
But the question remains...
Why are they here?

43:22.879 --> 43:27.536
King Philip
has sanctioned the...

43:27.579 --> 43:32.062
the killing of babies...
Prince Louis and his guards

43:32.105 --> 43:34.673
dressed as Templars with the
intent of killing my daughter.

43:34.717 --> 43:36.675
Prince Louis?

43:36.719 --> 43:38.436
Yes, after the King's
Men-at-Arms attacked us

43:38.460 --> 43:41.419
at the Church
of St. Lazarus.

43:41.463 --> 43:45.684
Rhone and Vasant say the king
has declared us his enemy.

43:45.728 --> 43:47.904
Yes, Grandmaster.

43:50.515 --> 43:52.256
Rhone?

44:20.284 --> 44:22.895
Prepare for war!
