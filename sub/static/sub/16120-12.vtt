00:00.860 --> 00:03.021
( glass shatters )

00:03.070 --> 00:06.699
Too Sweet:
No!No!No!

00:06.740 --> 00:09.163
Oh, man!

00:09.210 --> 00:11.269
Nova :
Too Sweet!

00:11.310 --> 00:13.130
Too Sweet.

00:13.180 --> 00:16.240
- ( Too Sweet yelping )
- Too Sweet. Too Sweet!

00:16.280 --> 00:19.716
Too Sweet! Too Sweet!
Wake up, baby. It's Nova.

00:19.750 --> 00:21.115
You're dreaming.

00:21.150 --> 00:22.640
It's okay. It's okay.

00:22.690 --> 00:24.419
( shushing )

00:26.420 --> 00:28.718
(Too Sweet sobbing )

00:30.590 --> 00:32.421
They was beating me.

00:35.330 --> 00:37.366
They wouldn't stop.

00:41.300 --> 00:42.562
They wouldn't stop.

00:49.310 --> 00:51.847
You're okay.
You're okay.

00:55.720 --> 00:58.541
( music plays )

00:58.590 --> 01:00.285
* Dreams never die

01:00.320 --> 01:02.288
* Take flight
as the world turns *

01:02.330 --> 01:03.729
* Dreams never die

01:03.760 --> 01:06.422
* Take flight
as the world turns *

01:06.460 --> 01:07.859
* Keep the colors
in the lines *

01:07.900 --> 01:10.323
* Take flight

01:10.370 --> 01:12.338
* Dreams never die

01:17.770 --> 01:21.433
* Keep the colors
in the lines *

01:21.480 --> 01:24.404
* Keep the colors
in the lines, take flight *

01:34.390 --> 01:36.654
Hollywood:
Now, it has been a week.

01:36.690 --> 01:40.524
I paid $139
for expedited services.

01:40.560 --> 01:42.721
Now, where I'm from,
"expedited" means faster

01:42.770 --> 01:44.590
than your normal
slow-ass service.

01:44.630 --> 01:46.393
Yeah.

01:46.440 --> 01:47.862
Yeah, I hear you.

01:47.900 --> 01:49.401
Well, y'all need
to tighten up over there,

01:49.440 --> 01:50.907
is all I'm trying to say.

01:50.940 --> 01:52.373
( phone beeps off)

01:52.410 --> 01:54.628
What's that all about?

01:54.680 --> 01:57.672
Me and Leanne paid for
one of them quickie divorces.

01:57.710 --> 01:59.610
There ain't nothing
quick about it.

01:59.650 --> 02:02.414
And I can't pull up
on your aunt without
some proof.

02:02.450 --> 02:03.849
You ain't never lied.

02:06.190 --> 02:09.421
You know, I never really
even noticed it before.

02:09.460 --> 02:10.927
But you sitting
behind his desk,

02:10.960 --> 02:13.520
you look like your daddy
spit you right out.

02:16.470 --> 02:18.768
Got that same look
on your face and everything.

02:18.800 --> 02:22.668
What look's that?
Worry?

02:24.940 --> 02:26.532
I'll go and handle
this business.

02:26.580 --> 02:28.536
I'm going to holler at you
in a little while.

02:35.550 --> 02:37.313
( cell phone vibrates )

02:41.720 --> 02:43.654
Charley's voice:
Hi, you've reached
Charley Bordelon-West.

02:43.690 --> 02:44.918
I can't come to the phone
right now.

02:44.960 --> 02:46.552
Please leave a message.

02:46.600 --> 02:48.818
We got to figure out
this mill deal.

02:48.860 --> 02:52.535
We don't grind, that's
$1.5 million worth of cane

02:52.570 --> 02:54.731
just being left out to rot.

02:54.770 --> 02:56.635
Call me back, Charley.

02:58.840 --> 03:00.376
( phone beeps off)

03:06.980 --> 03:09.289
- What do you think?
- Too rislq.

03:09.320 --> 03:10.810
Good things
usually are.

03:10.850 --> 03:12.681
The equipment's
not up-to-date.

03:12.720 --> 03:14.312
That's not going
to cut it.

03:14.360 --> 03:15.884
Well, not now,
but I'll buy new equipment.

03:15.920 --> 03:17.751
You know,
I'll clean it up.

03:17.790 --> 03:21.351
Charley, that'll take you
at least six months to set up.

03:21.400 --> 03:23.368
By that time we will have
missed harvest.

03:23.400 --> 03:25.721
Come on, we can do it
in less time than that.

03:27.540 --> 03:28.734
How much is it?

03:30.640 --> 03:32.972
Owner says the Boudreauxs
are offering 8.

03:33.010 --> 03:37.208
But he said if I get
closer to 9, it's mine.

03:38.650 --> 03:40.311
But they want an offer
by the end of next week.

03:40.350 --> 03:41.647
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Wait.

03:42.820 --> 03:45.846
- Nine million dollars?
- Yeah.

03:45.890 --> 03:47.983
Charley, Farm and Loan
wouldn't lend you enough money

03:48.020 --> 03:49.624
to get through harvest.

03:49.660 --> 03:51.457
How are you going to come up
with $9 million in a week?

03:51.490 --> 03:52.798
I have an investor in mind.

03:52.830 --> 03:55.355
Frank Rovner,
the New Orleans Stingers owner.

03:55.400 --> 03:56.799
I'm meeting him
this afternoon.

03:56.830 --> 03:58.866
He'll go in for half.

03:58.900 --> 04:00.663
Hopefully.

04:02.410 --> 04:04.731
Tell me why.

04:04.770 --> 04:07.000
_ _Because this
IS beating the Boudreauxs
at their own game.

04:07.040 --> 04:08.473
They'll never
see this coming.

04:08.510 --> 04:10.341
So this is a revenge purchase?

04:10.380 --> 04:11.870
You said I needed
to go all in.

04:11.910 --> 04:13.912
Yeah, I meant
with the farm.

04:13.950 --> 04:16.510
But you know I'm not
a farmer, Remy.

04:16.550 --> 04:17.949
I'm a businesswoman.

04:17.990 --> 04:19.480
A CEO.

04:19.520 --> 04:22.353
Someone in control
of their own destiny.

04:22.390 --> 04:24.756
And what I plan to do
with this,

04:24.790 --> 04:26.496
is turn it into
my own busmess.

04:26.530 --> 04:27.952
Yeah, I'm sure the Durands

04:28.000 --> 04:31.299
had that the very same
thing in mind.

04:31.330 --> 04:33.935
This parish is littered
with abandoned mills,

04:33.970 --> 04:36.507
and people like you
who took on Goliath
and lost.

04:36.540 --> 04:39.407
No, I've taken on
bigger giants than
the Boudreauxs before.

04:39.440 --> 04:41.670
And won.

04:43.710 --> 04:46.440
And if you help me,

04:46.480 --> 04:49.711
maybe host a potluck
for some of those farmers
that I met before?

04:49.750 --> 04:52.651
Ah, here we go.

04:52.690 --> 04:54.089
- What?
- I'm going to be honest.

04:54.120 --> 04:55.656
Okay.

04:55.690 --> 04:57.988
Feeling a little bit used.

04:59.630 --> 05:00.927
- A little bit.
- ( scoffs )

05:00.960 --> 05:02.962
That's okay.
It's okay.

05:03.000 --> 05:05.560
We could talk about it
tonight over dinner and wine.

05:05.600 --> 05:09.434
- Remy Newell...
-Hm?

05:09.470 --> 05:12.678
Are you asking me out
on a date?

05:12.710 --> 05:14.974
Uh...yeah.

05:15.010 --> 05:16.773
I guess I am.

05:35.060 --> 05:36.721
- ( Keke laughing )
- Micah: Uh, what?

05:36.770 --> 05:38.863
- It's okay.
- You're positive?

05:38.900 --> 05:40.834
Yes.

05:40.870 --> 05:42.906
Also, Boogie wants you
to come to dinner,

05:42.940 --> 05:44.737
now that me and you
are a thing.

05:44.770 --> 05:47.534
So, wait, you and I
are like...?

05:48.910 --> 05:50.605
Aren't we?

05:52.080 --> 05:53.741
You kiss me
all the damn time.

05:53.780 --> 05:55.577
Yeah. Yeah.

05:55.620 --> 05:57.986
Okay.

05:58.020 --> 05:59.578
But, wait,
he's met me before.

05:59.620 --> 06:01.588
Why does he want me
to come over?

06:01.620 --> 06:03.451
Have you dated
a black girl before?

06:03.490 --> 06:05.720
Why are you
asking me this?

06:05.760 --> 06:07.489
- Because...
- Does It matter?

06:07.530 --> 06:09.395
You in the South now.

06:09.430 --> 06:12.797
When you date a black girl,
then you meet her daddy.

06:12.840 --> 06:16.606
He makes sure you got manners,
and put a little fear in you.

06:16.640 --> 06:19.507
Got it.

06:19.540 --> 06:22.907
I meant to ask you,
why do you call your dad
Boogie?

06:24.510 --> 06:26.774
Boogie's my stepdad.

06:26.820 --> 06:28.947
My real dad left me
when I was little.

06:28.980 --> 06:32.711
But Boogie's been way more
of a dad than he ever was.

06:37.830 --> 06:39.821
Have you, um...

06:39.860 --> 06:41.589
talked to your dad?

06:42.970 --> 06:44.119
No.

06:45.970 --> 06:48.894
I mean,
what's the point?

06:48.940 --> 06:50.931
So he can tell me_
that he's sorry agaIn?

06:53.680 --> 06:55.671
So he can tell me
that I don't understand?

06:58.250 --> 07:02.118
I mean, Keke,
he was sleeping with
prostitutes for years,

07:02.150 --> 07:03.811
acting like this
perfect dad.

07:03.850 --> 07:06.717
I don't even know
who he IS anymore.

07:09.220 --> 07:10.824
Micah, your dad loves you.

07:12.260 --> 07:14.820
And that stuff is just
between him and your mom.

07:14.860 --> 07:16.794
Okay, well,
it affected me too,

07:16.830 --> 07:19.025
so why do I have to
talk to him to make
him feel better?

07:20.970 --> 07:23.700
You're right.
You shouldn't.

07:27.640 --> 07:28.902
Come here.

07:30.250 --> 07:32.571
I'm sorry.

07:32.620 --> 07:35.544
I didn't mean to be all...

07:35.580 --> 07:37.582
No.

07:37.620 --> 07:40.987
Don't apologize
for saying what you feel.

07:51.730 --> 07:53.197
( laughs )

07:58.540 --> 08:01.100
You sure you can't
come over after school?

08:01.140 --> 08:04.143
Not if I want
to pass Calculus.

08:04.180 --> 08:06.614
Let me help you study
for Calculus then.

08:06.650 --> 08:08.868
You sure you remember?

08:08.920 --> 08:11.241
You've been out of school
for a while now.

08:11.290 --> 08:13.588
- I'm think it'll all come back.
-(laughs)

08:13.620 --> 08:15.588
You know, once we start
it'll start to--

08:15.620 --> 08:17.281
All right.

08:17.330 --> 08:19.025
( cell phone vibrates )

08:19.060 --> 08:21.290
Hey, Nova. What's up?

08:21.330 --> 08:22.888
Nova over phone:
It's me and Rah.

08:22.930 --> 08:24.659
Hey, where are you guys?

08:24.700 --> 08:26.793
At my place.

08:26.840 --> 08:29.764
He came by to tell me about
this really impressive idea
he has for the harvest,

08:29.810 --> 08:31.801
without a Landry
or Boudreaux in sight.

08:31.840 --> 08:33.000
Hey, Charley.

08:33.040 --> 08:35.201
Can't call me back?

08:35.240 --> 08:37.640
I went out to St._ James.
They real nice.

08:37.680 --> 08:38.772
We could grind with them.

08:38.810 --> 08:40.277
No, St. James is too far.

08:40.320 --> 08:41.878
It is.

08:41.920 --> 08:43.217
But I researched
a truckIng company

08:43.250 --> 08:45.138
that leases out refrigerated
trucks, you know,

08:45.190 --> 08:46.885
for like produce and stuff.

08:46.920 --> 08:49.889
We could haul
our cane In that,

08:49.930 --> 08:51.750
that way the sugar
and the cane don't
crystallize,

08:51.790 --> 08:53.155
and we shouldn't be out
nothing except, what,

08:53.200 --> 08:54.758
the trucks
and the diesel costs,

08:54.800 --> 08:56.097
which ain't cheap,

08:56.130 --> 08:57.563
but what other choice
we got?

08:57.600 --> 08:58.919
I told you I'm handling it,
Ralph Angel.

08:58.970 --> 09:00.892
You didn't sign anything?

09:00.940 --> 09:03.158
No, but I want to.
That's the point.

09:03.210 --> 09:05.098
I told you to wait.

09:05.140 --> 09:06.676
Aren't we partners?

09:06.710 --> 09:08.632
I mean,
maybe if you listen--

09:08.680 --> 09:10.568
I'm working on something.

09:10.610 --> 09:12.669
I told you, I've got it
handled, you guys.

09:12.720 --> 09:14.847
Just let me get things
in order. I've got to go,
okay? Bye-bye.

09:14.880 --> 09:16.108
Hi.

09:16.150 --> 09:17.686
Come on.
( phone signal beeps )

09:17.720 --> 09:19.210
I know she didn't just
hang up.

09:19.250 --> 09:20.854
Yeah, she did.

09:20.890 --> 09:23.256
Ain't nothing new,
though.

09:23.290 --> 09:24.723
If she don't come up
with the idea,

09:24.760 --> 09:26.352
she don't want
to hear about it.

09:26.390 --> 09:28.790
At least she picked up
your phone call.

09:28.830 --> 09:31.594
She sent me straight
to voicemail.

09:31.630 --> 09:32.790
I'll get into it.

09:32.840 --> 09:34.091
Mm-hmm.

09:34.140 --> 09:35.698
That's a pretty damn
goodidea.

09:35.740 --> 09:37.901
Good thinking.

09:39.270 --> 09:41.579
I'm proud of you.

09:43.010 --> 09:44.238
Appreciate that.

09:55.260 --> 09:56.386
Frank:
Charley.

09:56.420 --> 09:57.751
- Frank.
- ( Frank chuckles )

09:57.790 --> 09:59.382
- How are you?
- I'm well.

09:59.430 --> 10:01.227
- How's your son?
- He's doing well.

10:01.260 --> 10:03.399
Good. Uh, please.

10:03.430 --> 10:04.727
Thanks.

10:04.770 --> 10:07.136
You want some water, or--?

10:07.170 --> 10:09.092
I'll have what you're having.
But I'll take it neat.

10:09.140 --> 10:10.835
You're a woman
after my own heart.

10:10.870 --> 10:12.360
( laughs )

10:12.410 --> 10:14.037
So, I think Davis

10:14.080 --> 10:16.844
would consider coming
to play for the Stingers

10:16.880 --> 10:18.006
_ if the offer
IS competitive.

10:18.050 --> 10:21.110
I told you, a marquee
player like Davis

10:21.150 --> 10:24.142
is too rich for my blood.

10:24.190 --> 10:28.012
IfI could arrange
a sit-down with Davis,

10:28.060 --> 10:29.789
would you hear
my proposal?

10:31.790 --> 10:34.156
Tell me this, honestly.

10:34.200 --> 10:37.727
Would Davis West
throw down 25, 30 points
a game

10:37.770 --> 10:40.989
without Felix Evans
feeding him the assists?

10:41.040 --> 10:44.908
Because before Felix
got to the Gladiators,

10:44.940 --> 10:47.431
Davis wasn't putting up
those kind of stats.

10:47.480 --> 10:51.871
So you're saying
you'd like them both?

10:51.910 --> 10:54.447
I'm saying
that's not an option.

10:54.480 --> 10:58.018
Felix and Davis have all but
signed on the dotted line

10:58.050 --> 11:01.053
to play together
in New York.

11:01.090 --> 11:03.820
Well, you can't compete
unless you make an offer.

11:06.490 --> 11:08.299
I'm meeting
with Felix tomorrow,

11:08.330 --> 11:10.890
ifI can get his agent
to quit jerking me around.

11:10.930 --> 11:12.022
( laughs )

11:12.070 --> 11:13.469
And Davis?

11:13.500 --> 11:15.331
( sighs )

11:15.370 --> 11:18.237
Respectfully, Charley,

11:18.270 --> 11:20.807
do you have the access
and the approvals

11:20.840 --> 11:23.308
to even negotiate
on Davis's behalf?

11:23.350 --> 11:25.238
The access?

11:25.280 --> 11:27.817
He's my husband, Frank.

11:27.850 --> 11:30.318
That answer
should be obvious.

11:30.350 --> 11:31.681
And the approvals?

11:33.260 --> 11:36.354
I am the approval.

11:36.390 --> 11:38.051
Always have been.

11:38.090 --> 11:39.955
Nothing's changed
in that department.

11:41.500 --> 11:43.491
Charley, you don't have
to rush out.

11:43.530 --> 11:46.260
No, I see I have something
to prove to you.
But that's okay.

11:46.300 --> 11:49.133
I've been underestimated
before.

11:51.240 --> 11:52.366
Hmm!

11:53.840 --> 11:55.068
It's always a great
vantage point

11:55.110 --> 11:57.476
in negotiations, am I right?

11:57.510 --> 11:58.977
Have a good day, Frank.

12:09.290 --> 12:09.517
( sighs )

12:17.200 --> 12:20.363
Hey, I didn't
hear you come in.

12:20.400 --> 12:22.129
Blue's asleep.

12:25.140 --> 12:26.869
What's wrong?

12:28.280 --> 12:30.840
Just Charley.

12:30.880 --> 12:33.542
Same old, same old.

12:33.580 --> 12:37.289
Won't let me do anything,
say nothing.

12:37.320 --> 12:39.242
It's all her,

12:39.290 --> 12:42.987
all the time.

12:43.030 --> 12:47.126
Can't even do nothing
without her permission.

12:47.160 --> 12:49.822
Like she running
this farm and not me.

12:54.070 --> 12:56.265
You're the one taking care
of this place.

12:56.300 --> 12:57.528
But she don't see that.

12:57.570 --> 13:00.130
It doesn't matter
what she does.

13:00.180 --> 13:02.978
All th is you.

13:04.910 --> 13:08.016
You're the one up at dawn
planting and weeding

13:08.050 --> 13:11.178
and taking care of this place
day after day after day.

13:13.190 --> 13:16.785
You've accomplished so much
around here, Ralph Angel.

13:20.530 --> 13:22.521
Your daddy would be
so proud of you.

13:30.610 --> 13:32.532
I'm proud of you.

13:35.410 --> 13:37.503
You know what you've done,
and that's all that matters.

14:19.650 --> 14:22.187
( phone rings )

14:23.460 --> 14:24.620
Lena over phone:
Hello?

14:24.660 --> 14:26.082
Hi, Lena.

14:26.130 --> 14:27.552
It's Charley.
How are you?

14:27.600 --> 14:30.262
Oh, my God, Charley.
So good to hear your voice.

14:30.300 --> 14:33.360
I heard a little rumor
that you might be in town.

14:33.400 --> 14:35.436
You know I'm living
just outside of New Orleans,
right?

14:35.470 --> 14:37.301
I forgot your family
was living out here.

14:37.340 --> 14:38.659
I got a sister here, too.

14:38.710 --> 14:40.575
I remember.
You staying with her?

14:40.610 --> 14:42.976
No, Felix and I
are staying at The W.

14:43.010 --> 14:44.671
You know how it is
staying with family.

14:44.710 --> 14:46.507
They think you're bougie
because you like espresso

14:46.550 --> 14:48.518
and your own bathroom.

14:48.550 --> 14:49.642
( Lena laughs )

14:49.680 --> 14:51.113
( laughing )

14:51.150 --> 14:52.913
Right, right.

14:52.960 --> 14:54.655
So, while you're in town,
we should get dinner.

14:54.690 --> 14:55.987
You know, catch up.

14:56.020 --> 14:57.658
Oh, Felix and I
are leaving tomorrow.

14:57.690 --> 14:59.999
Oh, perfect.
We can go out tonight.

15:00.030 --> 15:01.258
Just us girls.

15:01.300 --> 15:02.653
Okay.

15:02.700 --> 15:04.395
That-- That would be great,
Charley.

15:04.430 --> 15:07.263
I'll come to you.
Hotel bar, 7-ish?

15:07.300 --> 15:08.494
Can't wait.

15:23.190 --> 15:24.646
( door opens )

15:27.460 --> 15:29.314
- Hey, Aunt Vi,
- Violet: Hey, you.

15:30.590 --> 15:32.421
Smells good.

15:32.460 --> 15:34.496
That for me or Hollywood?

15:34.530 --> 15:36.157
( chuckles )

15:36.200 --> 15:39.419
Well, I admit, I drove by
earlier this morning

15:39.470 --> 15:41.199
and saw his truck.

15:41.240 --> 15:42.434
I didn't think
he was coming back

15:42.470 --> 15:44.734
from the rig
until Saturday.

15:44.770 --> 15:47.568
I thought I'd drop by,
say hello.

15:47.610 --> 15:51.068
Got back a few days ago.

15:51.110 --> 15:52.509
Sorry, he got back when?

15:52.550 --> 15:55.474
A few days ago.
'Wood, you got a visitor.

16:04.230 --> 16:06.084
Hey, Vi.

16:06.130 --> 16:08.690
I thought I smelled
your macaroni and cheese.

16:10.230 --> 16:13.097
Hollywood,

16:13.140 --> 16:15.734
you've been back
almost a week

16:15.770 --> 16:18.603
and you ain't thought
to stop by?

16:18.640 --> 16:21.108
Not to the High Yellow,
or my house?

16:22.240 --> 16:25.209
( no audible dialogue )

16:25.250 --> 16:27.969
- Baby, I can explain.
- Don't bother.

16:29.650 --> 16:31.345
Come on, Aunt Vi.

16:31.390 --> 16:33.085
Aunt Vi.

16:33.120 --> 16:34.485
( door opens )

16:34.520 --> 16:36.317
- My bad, 'Wood--
- ( door closes )

16:39.130 --> 16:40.392
- Vi!
- Don't, Hollywood.

16:40.430 --> 16:42.022
I'm late for work.

16:42.060 --> 16:43.596
Hollywood:
Come on, Vi.

16:45.200 --> 16:47.259
( car starts )

16:47.300 --> 16:51.532
* I need someone's hand *

16:51.570 --> 16:56.234
* To lead me
through the night *

16:56.280 --> 16:58.248
* I need someone's arm... *

16:58.280 --> 17:00.578
Damn.

17:00.620 --> 17:02.576
_ Get those
divorce papers yet?

17:05.290 --> 17:08.418
Maybe you played this
all wrong.

17:08.460 --> 17:11.623
I didn't play it right,
that for damn sure.

17:12.730 --> 17:14.129
Damn it!

17:14.160 --> 17:17.425
* I need your love

17:17.470 --> 17:19.563
* So bad...

17:22.370 --> 17:24.429
I told Felix
I would divorce his ass

17:24.470 --> 17:26.506
if he signed
with Milwaukee.

17:26.540 --> 17:28.371
It's like winter eight months
out of the year.

17:28.410 --> 17:30.071
And if you haven't noticed,

17:30.110 --> 17:31.577
there's not a lot
of black folks living there.

17:31.610 --> 17:33.749
Why don't you
convince Felix
to move here?

17:33.780 --> 17:35.611
He and Davis
can play together.

17:35.650 --> 17:36.810
You know they make
a powerful combo.

17:36.850 --> 17:38.249
Well, yeah--

17:38.290 --> 17:39.587
Or are they already
planning that?

17:39.620 --> 17:42.282
It's too early
to talk about it.

17:42.320 --> 17:45.050
Oh, you should talk to Davis.
I'm sure he'll tell you.

17:46.790 --> 17:48.724
( phone line ringing )

17:54.140 --> 17:56.199
- ( cell phone vibrating )
- Sorry, let me grab this.

18:05.880 --> 18:10.146
Oh, my God,
I am so, so, so sorry.

18:10.190 --> 18:12.317
Remy ( over phone ):
So you did stand me up.

18:12.350 --> 18:13.886
Not really.

18:13.920 --> 18:16.286
Okay, so you're
on your way?

18:16.320 --> 18:17.457
No.

18:17.490 --> 18:19.219
Then you stood me up.

18:19.260 --> 18:22.320
And let me_
tell you something,

18:22.360 --> 18:25.158
I'm looking pretty fine,
if I do say so myself.

18:25.200 --> 18:27.760
I know you are.

18:27.800 --> 18:29.768
( laughter, chatter)

18:29.800 --> 18:32.860
Wait, wait, wait,
are you out on our date
without me?

18:32.910 --> 18:34.537
No, no. I--

18:34.580 --> 18:36.901
I had to meet a friend
who flew into town,

18:36.940 --> 18:39.579
and I spaced...

18:39.610 --> 18:42.443
I will make it up to you,
I promise.

18:43.690 --> 18:44.918
You better.

18:44.950 --> 18:46.611
Okay. I got to go.

18:46.650 --> 18:47.787
I'll call you soon.

18:47.820 --> 18:49.515
Bye.

18:49.560 --> 18:50.720
( phone beeps off)

18:53.500 --> 18:54.819
( sighs )

19:04.470 --> 19:07.177
Sorry. ForgotI had
other plans tonight.

19:07.210 --> 19:08.632
A date?

19:10.550 --> 19:13.713
You and Davis
were the perfect couple.

19:13.750 --> 19:16.344
Honestly,
like a fairy tale.

19:16.380 --> 19:18.314
Isn't there some way
you two can work it out?

19:18.350 --> 19:20.454
I know too much now.

19:20.490 --> 19:22.958
I mean, don't you?

19:22.990 --> 19:24.685
How could you go back
to Felix?

19:24.730 --> 19:28.222
What do you mean?

19:28.260 --> 19:32.367
Wait, didn't Felix
ever tell you what
happened that night?

19:34.470 --> 19:36.665
She was a prostitute
that extorted money from us?

19:36.700 --> 19:39.407
So you never
met with her?

19:40.780 --> 19:42.475
Milena Galoudian?

19:42.510 --> 19:45.399
No, just paid her off
like you.

19:46.780 --> 19:48.338
No.

19:48.380 --> 19:50.541
I met with her.

19:50.590 --> 19:53.718
So, do you know
what happened that night?

19:55.290 --> 19:56.848
Just the truth.

20:03.930 --> 20:05.727
You're going to convince Felix

20:05.770 --> 20:07.397
to withdraw from
the New York deal.

20:07.440 --> 20:09.635
- What?
- I don't want Davis up there.

20:09.670 --> 20:11.399
I want him here,
close to Micah.

20:11.440 --> 20:13.431
You refuse to go to Milwaukee.

20:13.480 --> 20:15.505
You want to be here,
close to family.

20:15.540 --> 20:17.872
Your sister and your friends.

20:17.910 --> 20:19.502
Me.

20:19.550 --> 20:21.916
Felix will do what you want.

20:21.950 --> 20:24.418
And this is what
you want.

20:24.450 --> 20:26.247
Are you threatening me?

20:26.290 --> 20:28.508
It's all about spin.

20:28.560 --> 20:30.425
About reputation.

20:30.460 --> 20:33.429
I am not going
to be blackmailed.

20:33.460 --> 20:35.257
( laughs )

20:36.960 --> 20:39.929
If you don't convince Felix
to play in New Orleans,

20:39.970 --> 20:42.359
a tape of Milena Galoudian

20:42.400 --> 20:44.766
re-telling what your husband
did to her that night

20:44.810 --> 20:46.539
will be on every
gossip site

20:46.570 --> 20:49.277
you've ever heard of
by tomorrow.

20:49.310 --> 20:51.904
I guarantee it'll ruin
the Knicks deal.

20:51.950 --> 20:53.975
It'll ruin Felix's career.

20:55.820 --> 20:58.311
And if you're anything
like me,

20:58.350 --> 21:00.238
it'll _ruin
your fairy tale.

21:09.860 --> 21:12.294
I told his cheap ass
I didn't play Double Dutch

21:12.330 --> 21:13.866
when I was a girl,

21:13.900 --> 21:16.892
and I don't pay "Dutch"
now that I'm a woman.

21:16.940 --> 21:18.567
( both laugh )

21:18.610 --> 21:20.532
You should have seen his face.
He was looking stupid.

21:20.580 --> 21:23.378
"Pay Dutch."

21:23.410 --> 21:25.776
Well, I don't pay
my wait staff

21:25.810 --> 21:28.449
to sit around and talk
while they're on the clock.

21:28.480 --> 21:30.983
So, get up
and get on back to work.

21:31.020 --> 21:33.454
Uh, what work?
Ain't nobody in here.

21:33.490 --> 21:35.549
Well, you better find
some work to do,

21:35.590 --> 21:37.956
because _this_ little
open mic night

21:37.990 --> 21:39.628
comedy session
you got going on?

21:39.660 --> 21:40.991
Closed.

21:44.700 --> 21:46.463
You know you need
to get out, girl.

21:46.500 --> 21:49.936
Get your mind
off Hollywood.

21:49.970 --> 21:52.962
Dance a little bit.
Have some fun.

21:53.010 --> 21:54.534
You'll forget
all about him.

21:55.780 --> 21:57.543
Oh, hey, baby.

21:57.580 --> 21:59.673
P_ut those over
in the corner,
thank you.

21:59.710 --> 22:01.814
Of course, miss.
No problem.

22:01.850 --> 22:04.614
Mm, you should come out
with us to the Juke tonight.

22:04.650 --> 22:06.345
The Juke?

22:06.390 --> 22:08.358
What y'all know about that?

22:08.390 --> 22:09.880
We know enough.

22:09.920 --> 22:12.559
What you got to say about it,
Mr. Delivery Man?

22:12.590 --> 22:14.023
My name's Dayo.

22:14.060 --> 22:15.925
Me and a few of my boys
are going to be there.

22:15.960 --> 22:18.360
We going to be there, too.

22:18.400 --> 22:19.719
What?

22:19.770 --> 22:21.931
Well...

22:21.970 --> 22:25.007
I hope you let me
buy you beautiful ladies
a drink then.

22:27.640 --> 22:29.574
He going to buy us drinks.

22:29.610 --> 22:31.339
( laughs )

22:32.650 --> 22:33.639
Girl, get to work.

22:33.680 --> 22:35.011
( singing )
Gonna go party!

22:35.050 --> 22:36.517
( laughs )

22:39.650 --> 22:41.550
- ( knock at door )
- Come on in.

22:41.590 --> 22:45.879
Sorry. Mr. Des Champs?
Nova Bordelon.

22:45.930 --> 22:47.056
"New Orleans Daily News."

22:47.090 --> 22:49.752
Right. Have a seat.

22:49.800 --> 22:51.995
So, you want to know

22:52.030 --> 22:54.965
about the life
of a public defender?

22:55.000 --> 22:56.558
I'm flattered, but--

22:56.600 --> 22:58.568
Actually, I'm here
about something else.

22:58.610 --> 23:01.704
The interview was just a ruse
to get past the guard dogs.

23:01.740 --> 23:03.640
Oh. You can see
I'm busy, so--

23:03.680 --> 23:05.045
I'll be fast.

23:05.080 --> 23:07.412
I'm here about
one of your cases.

23:07.450 --> 23:09.577
It's a kid by the name
of DeVonte Bonclair.

23:09.620 --> 23:11.042
He goes by "Too Sweet."

23:11.090 --> 23:13.558
I was told you were
his assigned defender.

23:13.590 --> 23:15.888
He's been out on bail for
a couple of months, and he
hasn't heard anything back--

23:15.920 --> 23:18.457
No offense, Miss Bordelon,
but I don't have a clue

23:18.490 --> 23:20.185
who you're talking about,
and I'm not going to know,

23:20.230 --> 23:23.529
not until his folder
works its way up that stack,

23:23.570 --> 23:25.526
and that stack over there.

23:25.570 --> 23:27.936
You say that
like it's okay.

23:27.970 --> 23:29.835
Look, this isn't
some law show

23:29.870 --> 23:32.703
where the good guy
represents the innocent kid

23:32.740 --> 23:34.628
and everyone
goes home happy.

23:34.680 --> 23:37.569
In real life
we're so backed up here,

23:37.610 --> 23:39.202
we can't even
represent folks.

23:39.250 --> 23:41.218
We're turning people away.

23:41.250 --> 23:44.742
The cases we_ do have aren't
gang to trial for years.

23:44.790 --> 23:46.712
So this kid is supposed
to just live in limbo?

23:46.750 --> 23:48.479
Don't know if he can
move on with his life

23:48.520 --> 23:50.784
or if he's going to get
thrown back in jail?

23:52.230 --> 23:54.698
Do you know what that does
to a person?

23:54.730 --> 23:57.699
- It's inhumane.
- Absolutely.

23:57.730 --> 24:00.767
We don't have the money
or the manpower
to move faster.

24:00.800 --> 24:04.031
It's like purgatory.
For all of us.

24:07.040 --> 24:08.473
I'm sorry.

24:08.510 --> 24:10.102
So am I.

24:12.210 --> 24:13.677
Hollywood:
And after all these years,

24:13.720 --> 24:14.971
she don't give me
the time of day?

24:15.020 --> 24:16.248
Like I'm somebody
off the street.

24:16.280 --> 24:18.043
No, no, I deserve
better than that.

24:18.090 --> 24:20.081
- You're right about that.
- And I been good to Vi.

24:20.120 --> 24:22.657
Ain't nobody say you ain't,
except Aunt Vi.

24:22.690 --> 24:25.227
- Ain't that the truth.
- I ain't lying.

24:25.260 --> 24:27.023
Darla:
Blue, we've already
read three books.

24:27.060 --> 24:29.494
Blue:
Please, Mommy,
just one more.

24:29.530 --> 24:30.827
Listen to your mom, Blue.

24:30.870 --> 24:33.065
- Blue: But, Pop...
- Go to bed.

24:35.700 --> 24:39.204
Enough about me.
What's up with Darla?

24:39.240 --> 24:40.639
What,
you talking about us?

24:42.280 --> 24:44.771
Nothing.
You know, just...

24:44.810 --> 24:47.643
Mm-mm. Don't give me
that "nothing," now.

24:47.680 --> 24:50.069
I ain't seen you
grin this hard

24:50.120 --> 24:52.611
since hush was a puppy
and tater was a tot.

24:54.790 --> 24:57.281
Things just good.

24:57.320 --> 24:59.925
That's all.

24:59.960 --> 25:01.951
- ( knock on door)
- Boogie: Hey! Hey, I hear you.

25:02.000 --> 25:03.297
- Who that?
- Hollywood: Boogie!

25:03.330 --> 25:04.922
Boogie, come on
in here, boy!

25:04.970 --> 25:07.791
- What do you say, Boogie?
- Hey, Ralph Angel.

25:07.840 --> 25:09.535
H-town.

25:09.570 --> 25:11.606
Y'all know what
Goddamn day it is?

25:11.640 --> 25:13.733
- Friday.
- All right!
So where the party at?

25:13.780 --> 25:14.929
Mm-mm.

25:14.980 --> 25:16.106
Boogie:
Hey, we got to live.

25:16.140 --> 25:17.277
Especially you.

25:17.310 --> 25:18.675
Walking around
with your head all down,

25:18.710 --> 25:20.200
looking like
your dog died.

25:20.250 --> 25:22.138
Because you sad
about Violet?

25:22.180 --> 25:24.045
Come on, man,
let's hit up a place.

25:24.090 --> 25:28.015
I appreciate it, all right?
But today just ain't the day.

25:28.060 --> 25:29.618
You killing me, 'Wood.

25:29.660 --> 25:31.981
I'm going to go check
on Darla and Blue.

25:32.030 --> 25:33.998
'Wood, we going
to do this.

25:34.030 --> 25:35.588
Hollywood:
Oh, we are, huh?

25:35.630 --> 25:36.995
Ralph Angel:
Get your head in the game.

25:37.030 --> 25:40.591
- Talk to him, Boogie.
- All right, man.

25:40.640 --> 25:42.267
- Get your head in the game.
- Hollywood: Mm-mm.

25:42.300 --> 25:44.063
Now, you heard
what he said, now.

25:44.110 --> 25:46.203
Don't be making us look old
in front of young blood.

25:46.240 --> 25:50.131
Old? That's you over there
with that Halloween
candy cane shirt.

25:50.180 --> 25:51.943
( both laugh )

25:51.980 --> 25:54.210
Okay, all right.
So come on, then.

25:54.250 --> 25:56.241
A little bit of fun
ain't never killed nobody.

25:56.280 --> 25:58.680
Right? Just one night.

26:00.150 --> 26:01.617
One night.

26:01.660 --> 26:04.049
( hip-hop music playing )

26:09.030 --> 26:10.998
( indistinct chatter )

26:30.920 --> 26:32.649
Thank you, baby.

26:32.690 --> 26:34.089
( laughs )

26:35.660 --> 26:37.685
All right. So you can't
just stand here.

26:37.730 --> 26:39.220
- Come on.
- Ah.

26:39.260 --> 26:40.659
( laughs )

26:51.010 --> 26:53.808
( indistinct chatter )

26:53.840 --> 26:55.307
That's what
I'm talking about, man.

26:55.340 --> 26:57.103
Hey, all right, man.
I'll grab us some drinks.

26:57.140 --> 26:58.676
- All right.
- All right? I got you.

26:58.710 --> 27:00.200
You know what I'm drinking
though, huh?

27:00.250 --> 27:01.649
Boogie:
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I got it.

27:01.680 --> 27:03.910
- He's so excited.
- I know.

27:03.950 --> 27:06.214
( both laugh )

27:06.250 --> 27:08.309
Man, I'm glad
you came out, though.

27:08.360 --> 27:10.828
All right.
I'm doing good, okay?

27:10.860 --> 27:12.179
- Ralph: All right.
- Okay.

27:12.230 --> 27:14.152
Let's see what's happening.

27:21.440 --> 27:22.964
( laughing )

27:26.710 --> 27:28.439
All right, hold up.
Hold up.

27:28.480 --> 27:30.630
You don't want
to do that.

27:39.320 --> 27:41.880
Look, I'm out.

27:41.920 --> 27:43.353
Nah, 'Wood...

27:43.390 --> 27:44.948
You tell Boogie
I bounced.

27:44.990 --> 27:47.288
'Wood, hold up.

27:48.860 --> 27:50.088
Hold...

27:56.140 --> 27:58.768
I didn't know you could
move like that.

27:58.810 --> 28:00.266
Well, now you do, Dayo.

28:00.310 --> 28:01.902
( chuckles )

28:06.250 --> 28:08.115
Yeah.

28:08.150 --> 28:09.879
Night.

28:09.920 --> 28:13.139
Wait, now. The night ain't
got to end like this.

28:13.190 --> 28:15.454
Well, me and Roberta, we--

28:15.490 --> 28:17.355
I got my own ride home, Vi.

28:17.390 --> 28:18.721
See there?

28:18.760 --> 28:20.159
I got music
back at my place.

28:20.190 --> 28:21.999
We could pick up right
where we left off.

28:22.030 --> 28:24.123
I had a really nice night.

28:24.170 --> 28:25.922
( clears throat )

28:25.970 --> 28:29.963
But it's late and I'm going
home, get in bed.

28:30.000 --> 28:32.002
By myself.

28:32.040 --> 28:35.407
And I will see you
the next delivery date.

28:40.350 --> 28:43.239
Good afternoon, Xavier,
and welcome

28:43.280 --> 28:46.215
to our conversation series
on soaal justice.

28:46.250 --> 28:49.356
I'm Melissa Harris-Perry
and joining me on stage today

28:49.390 --> 28:51.221
is Nova Bordelon.

28:51.260 --> 28:54.491
She's an award-winning
investigative reporter

28:54.530 --> 28:56.225
with the
"New Orleans Daily News,"

28:56.260 --> 28:58.091
and my soror.

28:58.130 --> 28:59.222
Welcome.

28:59.270 --> 29:00.862
Thanks for having me.

29:02.870 --> 29:05.805
Now, Nova,
our conversation today
is going to focus on

29:05.840 --> 29:08.206
the idea of the journalist
as activist.

29:08.240 --> 29:09.832
And looking at your body
of work,

29:09.880 --> 29:11.472
of which I'm a big fan,

29:11.510 --> 29:14.115
you've covered everything
from police corruption

29:14.150 --> 29:16.243
in low-income communities,

29:16.280 --> 29:20.239
to the problem of the American
migrant workforce.

29:20.290 --> 29:23.851
When you think of your role
as a journalist,

29:23.890 --> 29:25.983
do you feel a sense
of responsibility

29:26.030 --> 29:28.851
to take an advocacy position
in your work?

29:28.900 --> 29:30.299
I absolutely do.

29:30.330 --> 29:31.968
I've worked hard
to get to a place

29:32.000 --> 29:33.968
where I can choose
the stories I want to cover,

29:34.000 --> 29:36.889
and it's important for me
to reflect humanity in my work.

29:36.940 --> 29:38.828
And so there's definitely
an advocacy component

29:38.870 --> 29:40.406
in everything that I write.

29:40.440 --> 29:43.034
I think it's critical
that you use your platform,

29:43.080 --> 29:44.843
whatever that is--

29:44.880 --> 29:47.405
blogs, Twitter,
social media, whatever--

29:47.450 --> 29:48.917
to empower as well as--

29:50.180 --> 29:51.442
As educate.

29:51.490 --> 29:53.412
( applause )

29:58.030 --> 30:00.123
Let's talk about a piece
you wrote earlier this year,

30:00.160 --> 30:05.291
on the for-profit prison complex
and over-policing.

30:05.330 --> 30:07.161
I understand that you
were able to help
the young man

30:07.200 --> 30:10.169
featured in that story.
His name is Too Sweet.

30:10.200 --> 30:12.202
Yes, that's correct.
He's been released on bail,

30:12.240 --> 30:14.071
but we still have
a huge uphill battle

30:14.110 --> 30:15.407
to get his charges dropped.

30:15.440 --> 30:17.305
The Public Defenders' office
in LOUISlana

30:17.340 --> 30:19.046
is woefully underfunded,

30:19.080 --> 30:21.173
yet they are sure happy to keep
the bail money coming in.

30:21.220 --> 30:23.438
It could be years
before Too Sweet gets a trial.

30:23.480 --> 30:26.313
But I just want to reiterate,
his charges are quite serious.

30:26.350 --> 30:30.081
I mean, intent to distribute,
assault on an officer.

30:30.120 --> 30:32.088
So those are-- Those are
pretty serious charges.

30:32.130 --> 30:33.927
Serious charges
if they were true.

30:33.960 --> 30:37.498
Now, regardless,
no minor should _be held
in an adult prison.

30:37.530 --> 30:39.327
They are not equipped
to handle

30:39.370 --> 30:43.466
the emotional and psychological
trauma of prison culture.

30:43.500 --> 30:46.060
It's a good point.
That's a form of PTSD

30:46.110 --> 30:48.931
- that we rarely talk about.
- Yeah.

30:48.980 --> 30:50.902
Now, I know you're not
publicly affiliated

30:50.950 --> 30:53.339
with the Black Lives Matter
network or movement,

30:53.380 --> 30:55.940
but BLM has really
changed the way

30:55.980 --> 30:59.086
that civil rights and social
justice are articulated,

30:59.120 --> 31:02.351
and the way they're executed
in this country.

31:02.390 --> 31:05.086
But now, with one tweet,
you can move the needle.

31:05.130 --> 31:07.655
So as a journalist,
give me your thoughts

31:07.690 --> 31:11.228
on the Black Lives Matter
movement as a whole.

31:11.270 --> 31:13.966
The BLM energy was formally
birthed in response

31:14.000 --> 31:17.265
to the 2012 acquittal
of Trayvon Martin's killer.

31:17.300 --> 31:19.359
And there have been
chapters around the world

31:19.410 --> 31:21.469
that respond to incidents
of anti-blackness

31:21.510 --> 31:24.206
and state-sanctioned violence
against black people.

31:24.250 --> 31:26.206
The movement is for people
who are interested

31:26.250 --> 31:28.115
in the liberation
of black lives.

31:28.150 --> 31:31.381
And yet there's serious
criticism of BLM.

31:31.420 --> 31:33.240
What do you make
of those critiques,

31:33.290 --> 31:36.157
especially of their
relationship with
law enforcement?

31:36.190 --> 31:39.387
Nova:
The one criticism
that frustrates me the most

31:39.430 --> 31:42.991
is this idea that there's
a need for a leader,

31:43.030 --> 31:45.123
which is this
coded language for--

31:45.170 --> 31:48.560
meaning that there's no
straight male leader
at the helm.

31:48.600 --> 31:50.397
But truth is,
civil rights work

31:50.440 --> 31:52.635
has been organized
by communities of women, queer,

31:52.670 --> 31:56.629
and gender-non conforming
people of color.

31:56.680 --> 31:58.409
Secondly, there's this
misconception

31:58.450 --> 32:01.010
that anything pro-black
means anti-white.

32:01.050 --> 32:02.449
It doesn't.

32:02.480 --> 32:04.448
Anybody who wants to fight
for equity and justice

32:04.490 --> 32:06.583
should feel empowered
to do so.

32:06.620 --> 32:08.417
I mean, reality is,
law enforcement in this country

32:08.460 --> 32:11.020
is built on anti-black racism.

32:11.060 --> 32:13.381
As a community,
we need to interrogate

32:13.430 --> 32:15.318
our relationship
with the police.

32:15.360 --> 32:17.055
It's critical
for our survwal.

32:17.100 --> 32:19.068
We deserve to be
served and protected,

32:19.100 --> 32:21.534
and I want to work
hand in hand with
the brave men and women

32:21.570 --> 32:23.492
who agree with that
on the force.

32:25.070 --> 32:27.038
Because they do exist.

32:27.070 --> 32:28.708
I know that for a fact.

32:28.740 --> 32:31.345
Melissa:
I want to_than_k
XaVIer UniverSIty

32:31.380 --> 32:34.474
for sponsoring
and supporting us today,

32:34.520 --> 32:36.579
and also for all the folks
on Twitter here

32:36.620 --> 32:39.214
for being willing to talk
about social justice.

32:39.250 --> 32:41.059
- ( applause )
- Thank you for engaging
with us.

32:41.090 --> 32:42.580
I'm so sick of this.

32:42.620 --> 32:44.326
We got one more.
Let's do the last one.

32:44.360 --> 32:47.056
So slope equals
rise over run.

32:47.090 --> 32:49.593
Slope M is equal to...

32:49.630 --> 32:51.598
- One-half.
- Yes.

32:51.630 --> 32:53.063
What you talking about,
you needing help...

32:53.100 --> 32:54.294
Girl:
Mm-hmm, sure.

32:54.340 --> 32:56.490
( indistinct chatter )

32:56.540 --> 32:58.098
( cell phone chimes )

33:15.260 --> 33:17.581
Mom. Hey.

33:17.620 --> 33:20.384
Hey, sweetie.

33:20.430 --> 33:22.352
So, this is your
study group?

33:22.400 --> 33:24.493
Micah:
Yeah, yeah.
You remember Keke.

33:24.530 --> 33:26.327
Keke, Mom.

33:26.370 --> 33:28.463
And these are her friends
Latisha and Caesar.

33:28.500 --> 33:29.728
Hi, Mrs. West.

33:29.770 --> 33:31.237
Hi, Keke.

33:31.270 --> 33:33.500
And just Charley is okay.

33:33.540 --> 33:36.270
Miss Charley,
I follow you on Twitter,
and I love your style.

33:36.310 --> 33:37.777
It's so good to meet you.

33:37.810 --> 33:40.199
Thank you.

33:40.250 --> 33:42.775
Micah, isn't it getting
a little late?

33:42.820 --> 33:44.788
Well, yeah,
we're just gonna finish up
a couple problems,

33:44.820 --> 33:46.640
and then we'll be done.

33:46.690 --> 33:49.386
Okay.
Well, don't stay up too late.
Good luck on your finals.

33:49.420 --> 33:50.614
- Thank you.
- Thank you. Good night.

33:50.660 --> 33:51.786
Love you.

33:51.830 --> 33:53.127
- Love you?
- ( all laugh )

33:53.160 --> 33:55.151
Oh, my God.

33:55.200 --> 33:57.293
Your mom?
Fabulous.

33:57.330 --> 33:59.218
- Latisha: Fabulous.
- Fabulous.

33:59.270 --> 34:00.623
That's Miss West
for you.

34:00.670 --> 34:02.365
Latisha:
I'm going to be just like her.

34:02.400 --> 34:03.799
Micah:
All right, number five.

34:03.840 --> 34:05.398
- Latisha: All right.
- Keke: Focus.

34:05.440 --> 34:08.034
( indistinct chatter )

34:43.210 --> 34:45.269
Hey, Davis.

34:45.310 --> 34:47.574
It's about Micah.

34:47.610 --> 34:50.340
No, no, no, he's--
He's fine.

34:51.850 --> 34:54.580
But I'm really worried
about him, though.

34:54.620 --> 34:58.420
No, he's-- He's been
acting out.

34:58.460 --> 35:01.122
He's hanging with
the wrong crowd.

35:02.460 --> 35:04.621
No, he won't
listen to me.

35:06.200 --> 35:07.622
He needs you here.

35:11.670 --> 35:13.467
Yes I do.

35:13.510 --> 35:15.637
You should get down here
as soon as you can.

35:18.350 --> 35:19.647
Okay.

35:24.390 --> 35:25.618
( laughter )

35:25.650 --> 35:26.742
Micah:
No, that's a no.

35:26.790 --> 35:28.485
That's a no!

35:28.520 --> 35:30.408
( laughter )

35:32.260 --> 35:35.229
Latisha:
Thank you.

35:35.260 --> 35:36.898
Darla:
That's weird.

35:36.930 --> 35:38.591
Ralph Angel:
She be dealing with
crazy folk.

35:38.630 --> 35:40.621
Darla_:
She's nice.

35:40.670 --> 35:42.797
Ralph Angel:
You still talk to her?
That's crazy.

35:42.840 --> 35:44.364
Darla:
I do...

35:44.410 --> 35:46.298
( talking indistinctly)

35:52.950 --> 35:54.349
Ralph:
Hold up for one second.

35:54.380 --> 35:55.677
I'll be right back.

36:02.560 --> 36:04.152
What you say, 'Wood?

36:05.960 --> 36:07.825
Darla don't drink no more,

36:07.860 --> 36:10.522
and I'm having trouble
finishing this one.

36:10.560 --> 36:11.788
Nah, good ahead.

36:11.830 --> 36:12.922
- Nah, man.
- Come on.

36:12.970 --> 36:14.335
Nah,nah.

36:15.840 --> 36:17.660
You headed back
to the rig already?

36:17.700 --> 36:19.702
Thoughtyoujust
gotdone.

36:19.740 --> 36:21.674
I figure if I leave early
in the morning,

36:21.710 --> 36:23.371
I can pick up a shift.

36:23.410 --> 36:27.449
But I'll just stay down there.
Get me a crib.

36:27.480 --> 36:31.689
No use in rushing back here
If I ain't got nobody.

36:31.720 --> 36:32.880
You hear me?

36:39.590 --> 36:42.457
You know my door's
always open to you.

36:42.500 --> 36:44.422
Ain't no asking needed.

36:44.470 --> 36:45.789
Thank you, man.

36:45.830 --> 36:48.333
But you don't need
no roommate no more.

36:49.740 --> 36:51.332
You got new life.

37:00.750 --> 37:02.479
All right.

37:12.890 --> 37:14.448
Darla:
You okay?

37:14.500 --> 37:16.491
Ralph Angel:
Oh, no, I'm all right.

37:33.850 --> 37:37.741
You sure you got
to do this?

37:37.780 --> 37:39.884
Maybe you should tell Aunt Vi
you're leaving.

37:39.920 --> 37:41.785
Look, if them divorce
papers come,

37:41.820 --> 37:43.412
you just send them
to me, all right?

37:43.460 --> 37:44.779
Not that I even
need them no more.

37:51.400 --> 37:54.892
You know you always
going to be my unc, right?

37:54.940 --> 37:56.567
Me and Blue,
we're going to come visit.

37:56.600 --> 37:57.897
All the time.

37:57.940 --> 37:59.828
Oh, I'd like that.

37:59.870 --> 38:01.735
You take care of yourself,
Ralph Angel.

38:04.410 --> 38:05.547
Love you, 'Wood.

38:05.580 --> 38:07.548
Love you too, partner.

38:15.420 --> 38:17.411
( car engine start)

38:44.850 --> 38:46.488
( Darla sighs )

38:46.520 --> 38:47.942
It took three books,

38:47.990 --> 38:50.413
but Blue is finally asleep.

38:50.460 --> 38:52.121
I promised him we could
make blueberry pancakes

38:52.160 --> 38:54.025
_when I come back
in the morning, so...

38:55.600 --> 38:59.821
What are you doing
picking up my purse?

38:59.870 --> 39:01.963
Maybe you should
stay here for the night,

39:02.000 --> 39:05.367
and I'll go to the store
in the morning.

39:07.870 --> 39:10.338
- Hollywood--?
- Moved out today.

39:12.880 --> 39:15.075
We got the place
to ourselves.

39:30.900 --> 39:33.221
* Hold on tight

39:37.100 --> 39:39.864
* Hold on tight

39:39.910 --> 39:42.936
* Let me take you
far away *

39:42.980 --> 39:45.448
* Hold on tight

39:49.050 --> 39:51.518
* Hold on tight...

39:53.450 --> 39:54.951
Come on.

39:54.990 --> 39:57.652
* Hold on tight

40:08.570 --> 40:10.060
( cell phone rings )

40:16.480 --> 40:17.902
Nova over phone:
Hello?

40:17.940 --> 40:19.908
Hello, beautiful.

40:19.950 --> 40:21.815
Hi, Calvin.

40:25.220 --> 40:27.916
You were dazzling
on that stage.

40:27.950 --> 40:29.986
Thank you.

40:30.020 --> 40:31.920
( sighs )

40:31.960 --> 40:34.053
It meant a lot
to see you there.

40:34.090 --> 40:36.797
It's been too long.

40:36.830 --> 40:38.559
For me, anyway.

40:39.830 --> 40:42.833
Yeah. For me, too.

40:44.870 --> 40:47.805
What you said...

40:47.840 --> 40:49.728
The world needs more people
like you in it.

40:51.850 --> 40:53.977
You believe in T00 Sweet,
so I do, too.

40:54.010 --> 40:56.672
Due to_insufficient
eVIdence,

40:56.720 --> 40:59.644
all charges against Too Sweet
have been dismissed.

41:01.920 --> 41:04.013
He's a free man.

41:04.060 --> 41:07.826
Wh-- What?

41:07.860 --> 41:09.225
How?

41:09.260 --> 41:11.091
I have a contact
at the DA.

41:11.130 --> 41:13.690
I just kind of
called in a favor.

41:13.730 --> 41:15.163
I don't know
if I'll ever be able

41:15.200 --> 41:16.963
to thank you enough
for this.

41:17.000 --> 41:19.468
Don't. You never have to say
thank you to me.

41:20.740 --> 41:22.002
Nova...

41:24.280 --> 41:25.872
I love you.

41:25.910 --> 41:27.673
( sighs )

41:28.820 --> 41:30.549
We can't keep doing this.

41:32.820 --> 41:34.856
Falling back
together again.

41:34.890 --> 41:40.180
I can't handle
being broken again.

41:42.200 --> 41:43.827
I miss you.

41:46.770 --> 41:49.068
But I can't
share you anymore.

41:50.640 --> 41:52.767
I need to move on,
and...

41:55.640 --> 41:57.779
you're not mine to have.

42:00.050 --> 42:02.575
I left my wife, Nova.

42:03.680 --> 42:06.547
* Hoping that things

42:06.590 --> 42:08.683
* Will change

42:12.590 --> 42:17.926
* Hoping to lift away...

42:20.830 --> 42:22.991
( music playing )
