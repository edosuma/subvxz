00:23.210 --> 00:26.400
Do you know when life is the hardest?

00:26.400 --> 00:30.910
When you get betrayed by the one whom you trusted the most,

00:30.910 --> 00:34.090
that moment is the most painful and agonizing.

00:36.980 --> 00:38.790
Pandora's box.

00:38.790 --> 00:42.120
Pandora's box exists even between a married couple.

00:42.120 --> 00:44.120
One that must never be opened.

00:44.120 --> 00:49.000
But when that lid popped off,

00:49.000 --> 00:51.590
terrible hell began.

00:51.590 --> 00:54.770
A beautiful and fancy wedding...

00:54.770 --> 00:58.670
Why do two people in love have a wedding for others to see

00:58.670 --> 01:02.480
when going off together and living well should be enough?

01:02.480 --> 01:06.610
First show to show off to others.

01:06.610 --> 01:10.720
That's the start of show window.

01:11.390 --> 01:13.520
Get ready for CPR.

01:39.570 --> 01:45.580
Show Window: The Queen's House

01:48.220 --> 01:49.990
You're coming home early tonight, right?

01:49.990 --> 01:52.720
The mustard leaf kimchi you like is ripe and tasty now.

01:52.720 --> 01:54.360
I'll be a little late.

01:54.360 --> 01:56.300
A meeting was scheduled all of a sudden.

01:56.300 --> 01:58.330
Really?

01:58.330 --> 02:00.070
Too bad.

02:00.070 --> 02:02.440
Don't work too hard.

02:03.110 --> 02:05.820
Okay, see you at home.

02:45.700 --> 02:49.180
I'll be a little late. A meeting was scheduled all of a sudden.

03:16.680 --> 03:19.440
- Yes?
- Why aren't you here yet?

03:19.440 --> 03:21.490
I'm looking for parking.

03:22.710 --> 03:24.710
Just park it at the shopping complex.

03:24.710 --> 03:26.630
Shopping complex?

03:26.630 --> 03:29.570
Okay. I'll be up soon.

03:29.570 --> 03:30.960
Okay.

05:00.280 --> 05:03.610
Han Seon Joo

05:07.630 --> 05:09.840
Are you home now?

05:12.770 --> 05:14.450
Hello?

05:15.530 --> 05:17.670
Oh...

05:17.670 --> 05:21.340
Yeah, I'm home.

05:22.330 --> 05:24.070
Have you tried the mustard leaf kimchi?

05:24.070 --> 05:27.030
I don't know if it's to your liking.

05:27.030 --> 05:31.400
It's tasty. Make sure you give me the recipe later.

05:31.400 --> 05:37.180
I'm sorry, but if it's not urgent, can I call you back?

05:38.230 --> 05:43.340
By chance... is your boyfriend there with you?

05:44.160 --> 05:45.460
Yes.

05:47.180 --> 05:48.650
Okay.

05:51.390 --> 05:53.190
Then talk to you later.

06:35.260 --> 06:37.190
It's perfect.

06:38.210 --> 06:40.850
Be careful. You'll get it on your shirt.

06:40.850 --> 06:42.850
Where did you get it?

06:45.050 --> 06:48.360
Someone I know gave it to me.

06:48.360 --> 06:51.240
Someone you know? Who?

06:52.510 --> 06:55.790
Why are you getting it all over your face like a child? So messy.

06:55.790 --> 06:57.440
Messy?

06:59.480 --> 07:01.600
What are you doing?

07:01.600 --> 07:03.980
So we can be messy together.

07:03.980 --> 07:05.960
Don't do that!

07:05.960 --> 07:10.100
You're like a kid sometimes!

07:47.690 --> 07:50.290
I love another woman's man.

07:50.290 --> 07:52.610
My boyfriend doesn't really like meat.

07:52.610 --> 07:57.490
He knows how to pick fruits since his parents have an orchard.

10:29.530 --> 10:32.770
My Lovely Son

10:45.240 --> 10:47.190
Mom, where are you?

10:47.190 --> 10:50.560
I miss you, Mom.

11:25.660 --> 11:28.120
The mustard leaf kimchi...

11:29.700 --> 11:31.650
Who gave it to you again?

11:32.650 --> 11:34.240
Why?

11:36.600 --> 11:40.860
You moved in too recently to have met someone already.

11:41.420 --> 11:46.520
Also, you don't usually get close with others.

11:47.240 --> 11:51.900
It turns out this girl I used to work with lives nearby.

11:52.850 --> 11:55.330
I met her by chance.

11:55.330 --> 12:00.440
We were close but lost touch. She gave it to me.

12:02.360 --> 12:04.230
It must have been nice to see her.

12:09.290 --> 12:12.850
Still, don't be too friendly with her.

12:15.670 --> 12:17.490
Okay.

12:24.570 --> 12:26.440
I should go now.

12:26.440 --> 12:28.760
- Already?
- Yeah.

12:28.760 --> 12:33.620
I have some work left to do, so I need to finish it up at home.

12:36.810 --> 12:38.490
Sleep well.

13:48.850 --> 13:50.900
Hi honey, where are you?

13:50.900 --> 13:52.450
Where are you right now?

13:52.450 --> 13:54.750
Home. Why?

13:58.670 --> 14:00.950
You're home?

14:16.060 --> 14:17.590
Mom!

14:20.970 --> 14:24.590
Where have you been? Why didn't you answer our calls?

14:25.220 --> 14:29.550
Where have you been? Is something wrong?

14:30.860 --> 14:32.340
Honey.

14:33.440 --> 14:36.120
It's late. Go to bed now.

14:36.120 --> 14:37.420
Mom...

14:37.420 --> 14:41.480
I'm fine, so don't worry and go to bed.

14:41.480 --> 14:44.480
- Mom, exactly what--
- Didn't you hear? Go to bed!

14:46.870 --> 14:49.240
Yeah, listen to your mom.

14:49.240 --> 14:51.320
Come on, go upstairs.

14:51.320 --> 14:53.930
Go get some sleep.

14:59.810 --> 15:01.320
Honey.

15:41.710 --> 15:45.490
 I bought it at the flea market in front of Hongdae.

15:58.350 --> 16:02.890
I thought something happened. We were all so worried.

16:07.960 --> 16:10.480
Do you know this bracelet?

16:12.750 --> 16:14.460
No.

16:14.460 --> 16:16.920
I don't know it.

16:16.920 --> 16:18.900
You really don't?

16:20.470 --> 16:23.360
What is this bracelet?

16:26.420 --> 16:28.120
Never mind.

16:30.130 --> 16:33.450
Are you sure nothing happened?

16:33.940 --> 16:36.250
Did you eat dinner?

16:36.250 --> 16:38.450
I did. It's late.

16:38.450 --> 16:41.210
Where? Who with?

16:42.430 --> 16:44.590
At the company because of the meeting.

16:44.590 --> 16:46.470
What did you eat?

16:48.040 --> 16:49.680
What is it all of a sudden?

16:49.680 --> 16:53.220
I'm asking what you ate for dinner. Why can't you answer?

17:09.880 --> 17:12.300
- Yes, sir.
- Secretary Kang.

17:12.890 --> 17:16.520
What did we eat for dinner at the strategy meeting?

17:16.520 --> 17:17.880
Pardon?

17:20.010 --> 17:23.369
I had sandwiches and cookies prepared.

17:23.369 --> 17:28.540
Was something wrong with the food?

17:29.530 --> 17:32.650
No. Good night then.

17:39.060 --> 17:41.650
What is it?

17:41.650 --> 17:45.830
Are you sure you're okay?

17:45.830 --> 17:49.830
No. For now...

17:49.830 --> 17:52.000
For now, I'm fine.

17:52.900 --> 17:54.510
But...

17:55.450 --> 17:56.910
I don't have conviction.

17:56.910 --> 17:59.820
What do you mean by that?

18:02.140 --> 18:07.210
I'm feel a little... down today.

18:08.020 --> 18:12.880
I guess my depression is back. You know I get like this once in a while.

18:22.740 --> 18:24.860
If it's too hard,

18:26.660 --> 18:28.790
go see a doctor.

19:39.280 --> 19:40.660
Healing Talk Concert

19:47.760 --> 19:50.020
Hello.

19:51.120 --> 19:53.790
Please write down your concerns anonymously.

19:53.790 --> 19:55.280
Okay.

19:56.390 --> 19:58.820
People who continue to cheat

19:58.820 --> 20:02.620
have an addiction and formed bad habits.

20:03.280 --> 20:07.980
There's a way to stop it at once.

20:10.020 --> 20:12.760
Get a divorce. Cleanly.

20:13.700 --> 20:16.600
But, get a divorce after you are

20:16.600 --> 20:21.870
financially independent.

20:26.820 --> 20:30.840
Then should we listen to some of the concerns of those who came today?

20:38.980 --> 20:43.950
My husband is perfect. A great father and a sweet husband,

20:43.950 --> 20:47.850
and a respectable businessman who's flawless.

20:47.850 --> 20:52.850
But I think he has a woman.

20:52.850 --> 20:57.500
I'm so confused thinking about his other side I've never once considered before.

20:57.500 --> 21:00.610
I feel like the family I've protected with so much effort

21:00.610 --> 21:04.490
is going to crumble overnight.

21:19.710 --> 21:22.480
You have two choices.

21:22.480 --> 21:27.610
Don't try to find out and trust him until the end.

21:27.610 --> 21:33.060
Or look into it and uncover

21:33.060 --> 21:38.720
everything and end it once and for all. It's up to you which decision you make.

21:38.720 --> 21:44.480
Your husband, children? Other people? Don't worry about them what they think.

21:44.480 --> 21:51.280
Living a life where you make yourself happy instead of others

21:51.280 --> 21:55.530
will be a life without regret. Please remember that.

21:57.760 --> 22:00.350
Healing Talk Concert

22:05.680 --> 22:08.610
How did you like the lecture?

22:08.610 --> 22:11.020
I liked it.

22:11.020 --> 22:14.500
Did you like the solution I suggested?

22:16.660 --> 22:18.660
What do you mean?

22:21.130 --> 22:23.540
Why are you so surprised?

22:23.540 --> 22:27.620
The solution I gave to the person whose concern I read out loud. How was it?

22:33.450 --> 22:35.710
Well,

22:35.710 --> 22:39.600
you told them to live a life for themselves,

22:39.600 --> 22:42.710
but who doesn't know that?

22:42.710 --> 22:47.040
Still, no one can live that way.

22:47.040 --> 22:48.440
Why not?

22:49.290 --> 22:51.810
Living for yourself...

22:51.810 --> 22:54.770
It's hard to know what that is exactly.

22:54.770 --> 22:58.610
I can't separate my family from my own life.

22:58.610 --> 23:02.860
That's... probably every married woman's

23:02.860 --> 23:05.810
common thought.

23:05.810 --> 23:07.850
It's a dilemma, too.

23:16.670 --> 23:20.380
Can I ask you something?

23:22.140 --> 23:25.680
- Why wasn't it me?
- What?

23:25.680 --> 23:29.620
As a potential husband, why was I dropped?

23:29.620 --> 23:31.700
Out of the blue?

23:31.700 --> 23:36.420
I mean, I was always curious why I didn't make it.

23:37.310 --> 23:39.450
What was the reason?

23:42.410 --> 23:44.500
You were too...

23:47.630 --> 23:49.840
free.

23:58.900 --> 24:01.460
Executive Director Shin Myeong Seop

24:03.770 --> 24:06.370
Do you know this bracelet?

24:26.410 --> 24:27.420
Hello?

24:27.420 --> 24:30.570
Hi. What are you doing?

24:30.570 --> 24:34.510
- I was on my way to the art academy.
- You're teaching today?

24:34.510 --> 24:39.050
Yeah. Why are you calling at this hour?

24:39.590 --> 24:45.530
Well... the bracelet I gave you as a present...

24:45.530 --> 24:47.600
do you still wear it these days?

24:51.240 --> 24:55.300
Of course. I wear it every day since I love it so much.

24:55.300 --> 24:57.680
I'm wearing it now, too.

24:58.650 --> 25:01.020
You're wearing it now, too?

25:01.020 --> 25:02.770
Yeah.

25:03.390 --> 25:06.740
Why? You want a photo of it?

25:08.750 --> 25:11.520
No. Never mind.

25:11.520 --> 25:14.710
Okay then. Enjoy your teaching.

25:31.550 --> 25:32.970
Yes?

25:35.300 --> 25:37.090
Oh, Jeong Won!

25:37.090 --> 25:38.680
Welcome.

25:40.940 --> 25:44.320
Thanks to you, I came back safely after finishing my studies.

25:44.320 --> 25:45.560
Thank you.

25:45.560 --> 25:48.930
You asked him to return?

25:48.930 --> 25:50.450
Yes.

25:51.930 --> 25:54.560
You must have offered him a position.

25:54.560 --> 25:57.140
Something like Team Leader of the design team?

25:58.400 --> 25:59.830
Yes.

26:01.310 --> 26:05.040
I... know that I'm lacking.

26:05.040 --> 26:08.560
I'll politely decline his offer.

26:08.560 --> 26:10.390
What arrogance!

26:11.520 --> 26:14.870
Do you know how much I spent on you? How dare you freely decline the offer?!

26:14.870 --> 26:21.080
Come and work. All the money that went into you, pay it back by working here.

26:21.770 --> 26:23.480
You can leave now.

26:28.430 --> 26:32.330
Executive Director Shin, you can stay.

26:32.850 --> 26:34.210
Yes.

26:40.830 --> 26:44.120
Is the Shanghai department store issue still not resolved yet?

26:44.120 --> 26:45.970
It should be resolved soon.

26:45.970 --> 26:48.220
Soon, soon, soon!

26:48.220 --> 26:50.070
If you're not confident, quit your job.

26:50.070 --> 26:54.110
I won't go easy on your just because you're my son-in-law. If you can't do your job,

26:54.110 --> 26:55.840
I don't need you.

26:55.840 --> 27:00.580
There are plenty of people who I can replace you with.

27:06.990 --> 27:10.780
I'll get it done within a month.

27:10.780 --> 27:16.570
If I don't, I'll leave willingly.

27:20.410 --> 27:22.970
Just one month.

27:22.970 --> 27:24.430
Yes, ma'am.

27:28.420 --> 27:32.310
If you resolve the issue,

27:34.040 --> 27:37.490
I'll promote you as the group's

27:37.490 --> 27:39.300
general manager.

27:52.700 --> 27:54.130
Yes?

29:02.570 --> 29:06.320
What's gotten into you? You never come out when I ask you to.

29:06.320 --> 29:09.300
Asking for a date first.

29:10.590 --> 29:16.410
I love steak, but I've been eating to suit your taste,

29:16.410 --> 29:20.620
so I forgot that I liked meat.

29:20.620 --> 29:22.310
Really?

29:22.310 --> 29:24.600
I feel so bad.

29:24.600 --> 29:29.910
I'm going to eat what I want

29:29.910 --> 29:31.280
and wear from now on.

29:31.280 --> 29:36.220
Okay. You've been too dedicated to our kids and me.

29:36.220 --> 29:39.260
Do everything you want, too, from now on.

29:39.260 --> 29:40.900
What about you?

29:40.900 --> 29:42.420
Huh?

29:42.420 --> 29:46.370
Are you doing whatever you want with your life?

29:46.370 --> 29:49.480
Well, kind of.

29:55.870 --> 29:57.630
By chance...

30:00.270 --> 30:03.880
is there anything you're keeping from me?

30:03.880 --> 30:05.360
Keeping from you?

30:05.360 --> 30:11.170
I was curious. I feel like I know all there is to know about you,

30:11.170 --> 30:14.550
but sometimes I wonder if I'm being delusional.

30:18.220 --> 30:25.020
Do you... have any secrets

30:25.020 --> 30:26.680
that I don't know about?

30:33.340 --> 30:34.990
I do.

30:36.060 --> 30:40.480
A secret I'm hiding from you.

30:45.070 --> 30:48.650
And what is that?

31:00.720 --> 31:02.270
My heart.

31:03.850 --> 31:06.990
How much I love you.

31:09.560 --> 31:12.200
All these years, what I've shown you

31:12.200 --> 31:16.510
has only been a hundredth

31:16.510 --> 31:20.090
no, a thousandth of how I feel about you.

31:32.370 --> 31:33.960
Hold on a second.

31:37.300 --> 31:39.930
Yes? Did you look into it?

31:41.120 --> 31:44.810
Okay. Set up an emergency meeting.

31:44.810 --> 31:46.190
Okay.

31:48.370 --> 31:52.740
There's something urgent, so I need to go.

31:52.740 --> 31:57.070
I feel bad for ruining our first date in a long time.

31:57.070 --> 32:00.000
It's okay. Go ahead.

32:01.590 --> 32:05.990
Then eat slowly and get home safe.

32:05.990 --> 32:07.570
Sorry.

32:37.270 --> 32:39.740
I have something to ask.

32:39.740 --> 32:44.360
Is anything possible no matter what the condition?

33:31.780 --> 33:35.910
Seon Joo. What brings you by so early?

33:35.910 --> 33:38.270
Let me come in for a second.

34:02.990 --> 34:05.190
Is something wrong?

34:13.949 --> 34:16.130
Seon Joo.

34:16.130 --> 34:18.570
Can you get me some coffee?

34:19.380 --> 34:20.940
Okay.

34:31.780 --> 34:36.520
Can I use your bathroom?

34:36.520 --> 34:38.139
Of course.

34:41.130 --> 34:45.239
I came out in a hurry, so I didn't even put on any makeup.

34:45.239 --> 34:48.750
Of course. Use it freely.

35:59.060 --> 36:01.060
Have you had breakfast?

36:01.060 --> 36:03.680
If you haven't, let's have some brunch together.

36:03.680 --> 36:07.200
The cafe out front has pretty good brunch.

36:21.650 --> 36:24.860
I'll get you more coffee.

37:03.340 --> 37:05.870
What's his name?

37:07.010 --> 37:10.800
What is it?

37:10.800 --> 37:13.040
His name.

37:13.040 --> 37:15.370
Your man.

37:20.830 --> 37:23.380
Joon Ho.

37:23.380 --> 37:26.360
His name is Kim Joon Ho.

37:28.670 --> 37:31.250
But why do you ask?

37:31.250 --> 37:34.300
The man you love is called

37:34.300 --> 37:37.500
Kim Joon Ho?

38:18.220 --> 38:20.150
What are you doing here, Joon Ho?

38:20.150 --> 38:22.570
I left something behind.

38:24.110 --> 38:25.850
I told you before.

38:25.850 --> 38:29.720
She's my friend. This is Kim Joon Ho.

38:33.240 --> 38:35.080
Hello.

38:42.730 --> 38:45.530
I'm sorry for barging in so early in the morning.

38:45.530 --> 38:47.520
I'll get going.

39:06.430 --> 39:08.610
Great job.

39:10.730 --> 39:12.640
Thank you.

39:13.970 --> 39:18.210
When you need me again, just send me a text.

39:35.850 --> 39:37.840
Not yet.

39:37.840 --> 39:39.810
It's not time yet...

39:58.310 --> 40:00.020
Good morning, Seon Joo!

40:00.020 --> 40:01.940
Good morning.

40:04.020 --> 40:05.850
By the way,

40:12.620 --> 40:14.720
last time

40:14.720 --> 40:17.260
why did you ask me what's going on

40:17.260 --> 40:19.780
with my husband?

40:19.780 --> 40:22.010
What?!

40:22.010 --> 40:24.300
I did?

40:25.180 --> 40:28.190
Oh, I guess I was just saying hello.

40:28.190 --> 40:30.370
But why do you ask?

40:30.370 --> 40:32.340
It's nothing.

40:32.340 --> 40:34.420
Go ahead and exercise.

40:35.300 --> 40:37.030
Bye!

40:54.790 --> 40:57.410
Did I light the fuse for no reason?

41:06.800 --> 41:08.880
I don't see Seon Joo.

41:08.880 --> 41:11.910
They were stuck together, but she's alone.

41:11.910 --> 41:13.480
Maybe they had a fight.

41:13.480 --> 41:15.430
I knew it wouldn't last.

41:15.430 --> 41:19.520
How can the queen and a mistress get along?

41:20.520 --> 41:22.960
Let's go use the sauna.

41:35.380 --> 41:39.190
Why would you wear a ring into the sauna?

41:39.190 --> 41:42.180
What is this ring that you're wearing it everyday?!

41:42.180 --> 41:44.270
It's not even that pretty.

41:44.270 --> 41:46.450
It's a Moobulhwae ring.

41:46.450 --> 41:48.960
Moo what?

41:48.960 --> 41:53.630
It's a ring for the private group formed of just the top 1% of my chief prosecutor's training center colleagues.

41:53.630 --> 41:55.720
Moobulhwae.

41:55.720 --> 42:02.150
You could say it's a meeting of the future power that will lead the judicial world of Korea.

42:02.150 --> 42:07.550
What if I get scratched by that ring?

42:07.550 --> 42:09.810
Take it off now!

42:10.920 --> 42:12.980
Fine.

42:21.690 --> 42:25.300
My ring! My ring!

42:26.860 --> 42:28.380
Go!

42:33.670 --> 42:37.080
Han Seon Joo, have you only been shooting all this time?

42:37.080 --> 42:39.830
It's my first time in three years.

42:44.860 --> 42:46.790
How are you this good then?

42:46.790 --> 42:51.100
I don't know. Maybe because I'm in a good mood?

42:51.100 --> 42:52.790
Something good happen?

42:52.790 --> 42:55.080
Well, not something good.

42:55.080 --> 42:59.960
More like something that's been gnawing at me disappeared in one moment.

43:04.160 --> 43:05.880
Go!

43:12.560 --> 43:13.940
Are you crazy?

43:13.940 --> 43:18.310
Why would you go to the sauna wearing that precious ring?!

43:18.310 --> 43:19.910
I- I'm sorry.

43:19.910 --> 43:23.310
Don't you know you need the ring for entrance?

43:23.310 --> 43:26.860
Were you feeling full of yourself wearing something that surpasses your worth?

43:26.860 --> 43:28.690
I'll make sure to get the ring back

43:28.690 --> 43:31.850
Whatever it takes, I'll get it back.

43:33.330 --> 43:37.400
What a ball and chain. Don't follow me.

43:40.180 --> 43:42.170
It's not even a brand name item.

43:42.170 --> 43:46.240
Why is he raising a fuss in the middle of the night?

43:46.240 --> 43:50.670
What do you mean?! You can't buy that ring anywhere!

43:50.670 --> 43:52.970
Let's calm down.

43:52.970 --> 43:56.420
My husband is looking into it right now.

43:57.570 --> 44:00.820
Yes, hello. I'm Lee Joon Sang of JS Jewlry.

44:00.820 --> 44:02.710
I'm sorry to call so late.

44:02.710 --> 44:09.100
Sir, do you know of a ring called Moobulhwae that was made by your company?

44:09.100 --> 44:12.550
Is there anyway to get another one? The owner lost it.

44:12.550 --> 44:15.190
She wants to get a replacement.

44:17.640 --> 44:19.650
You have a sample?

44:19.650 --> 44:22.400
They have it. You're fine now.

44:35.340 --> 44:37.250
Good morning.

44:37.250 --> 44:40.800
The light was on until 1AM this morning. You're already up?

44:40.800 --> 44:43.710
Mom. I want to get the shot for controlling my menstruation cycle.

44:43.710 --> 44:46.000
I told you you can't. No more about that.

44:46.000 --> 44:51.350
If I get bad scores because I feel horrible from PMS, it only hurts me.

44:51.350 --> 44:56.050
I love you, Tae Hee. You're doing well now.

44:56.050 --> 45:01.200
I just want you to live naturally like you have been.

45:01.200 --> 45:03.310
Are you sure you're the mother of a high school senior?

45:03.310 --> 45:07.180
Wash up and come down. You have to eat before you to go school.

45:25.740 --> 45:30.010
My son. Did you sleep well?

45:30.010 --> 45:32.150
Mom.

45:33.480 --> 45:36.330
I love your smell.

45:36.330 --> 45:40.020
You're like a junior high baby.

45:56.550 --> 45:58.910
What brings you here without calling?

45:58.910 --> 46:01.870
To apologize.

46:01.870 --> 46:05.560
I misunderstood you a little.

46:05.560 --> 46:07.950
What do you mean?

46:07.950 --> 46:11.270
Here. It's my apology.

46:14.240 --> 46:16.660
Come in. Let's have some tea.

46:16.660 --> 46:20.410
I have an appointment I need to go to, so let's have coffee next time.

46:20.410 --> 46:23.530
Okay. Thank you for this.

46:23.530 --> 46:25.550
I'll see you.

46:42.410 --> 46:44.910
Han Seon Joo...

46:44.910 --> 46:50.470
it would have been so great if you weren't such a nice person.

47:13.810 --> 47:16.560
Did I eat something wrong?

48:17.420 --> 48:21.250
You don't like getting together for drinks like this. What's going on?

48:21.250 --> 48:22.140
More.

48:22.140 --> 48:24.000
You know that a lot of

48:24.000 --> 48:28.030
Korean brands were rejected from entering the Shanghai department store, right?

48:28.890 --> 48:35.340
Our company got turned down while in the process of entering.

48:37.670 --> 48:41.370
So? What is it that you want?

48:43.390 --> 48:49.020
I wanted to ask you to reconsider letting our brand get into the store.

48:49.020 --> 48:53.020
I came to see you ask for your help, Chairman Oh.

48:53.020 --> 48:54.800
Listen here, Executive Director Shin.

48:54.800 --> 48:57.840
I am a businessman,

48:57.840 --> 49:01.600
and I need to gain something from it.

49:03.060 --> 49:08.920
Right now, there's nothing I can do for you that would be beneficial,

49:08.920 --> 49:13.310
but later, I'll be sure to pay you back.

49:15.180 --> 49:20.240
Suddenly, I don't feel like drinking anymore.

49:41.380 --> 49:43.060
Please...

49:44.100 --> 49:46.560
please help me, sir.

49:54.330 --> 49:56.530
Sorry for coming to see you out of the blue, Chairman Oh.

49:56.530 --> 49:59.560
I'm your father's friend, not chairman.

49:59.560 --> 50:02.330
I'm like your father.

50:04.270 --> 50:08.700
To be honest, I had a favor to ask.

50:08.700 --> 50:13.170
Favor? What is it?

50:19.400 --> 50:23.390
This is why I like you.

50:35.970 --> 50:39.610
Here. Drink up.

50:39.610 --> 50:42.430
It's to celebrate becoming my family.

50:43.630 --> 50:45.340
Yes, sir.

51:25.350 --> 51:26.610
Thank you, Driver Yeon.

51:26.610 --> 51:28.920
Of course. Then rest well.

51:28.920 --> 51:31.800
- Good-bye.
- Good-bye.

51:48.880 --> 51:53.340
Chairman Oh, thank you!

51:54.100 --> 51:58.380
Yes. I'll take good care of him.

51:58.380 --> 52:01.270
Okay. Have a good rest then.

52:22.200 --> 52:24.430
It's popular these days.

52:24.430 --> 52:27.460
A lot of people look for it.

52:27.460 --> 52:29.140
- Can I try some?
- Of course.

52:29.140 --> 52:33.300
It's nice to use it while carrying it around with you.

52:41.920 --> 52:44.020
It's moisturizing.

52:45.380 --> 52:47.090
Please give me these and wrap them up.

52:47.090 --> 52:49.520
Okay.

53:13.010 --> 53:15.140
Pick out something else.

53:25.240 --> 53:27.260
Mi Ra!

53:30.550 --> 53:32.260
Oh, Seon Joo!

53:32.260 --> 53:33.500
Did you come to buy something?

53:33.500 --> 53:36.600
Yes. This and that.

53:37.440 --> 53:39.850
Oh right. Say hello to my kids.

53:39.850 --> 53:42.740
I told you about her. She's a close friend of mine.

53:42.740 --> 53:44.340
Hello.

53:44.340 --> 53:45.620
Hi, nice to meet you.

53:45.620 --> 53:48.030
Oh right, have you had dinner?

53:48.030 --> 53:51.770
Let's eat together after I drop them off at the academy.

53:51.770 --> 53:53.280
Do you want to come over to my house?

53:53.280 --> 53:56.580
Your house?

54:34.710 --> 54:37.210
Those shoes mean a lot to me.

54:43.640 --> 54:48.910
Those, my father made for me,

54:50.050 --> 54:56.060
and these, my husband made them for me as a present when he proposed.

55:24.910 --> 55:27.570
It's really a beautiful home.

55:28.930 --> 55:32.900
Like you, there's a lot of warmth and comfort throughout.

55:37.610 --> 55:43.620
Will I... be able to have a family like you?

55:47.840 --> 55:50.620
Of course.

55:50.620 --> 55:55.310
You can have

55:55.310 --> 55:58.120
a beautiful family of your own, too.

55:59.140 --> 56:01.660
Right?

56:01.660 --> 56:05.650
I, too... will be able to have one, right?

56:05.650 --> 56:07.700
Someday?

56:08.540 --> 56:10.400
Of course.

56:18.850 --> 56:21.570
I don't know if it suits your taste.

56:26.750 --> 56:29.640
How much do you love your husband?

56:29.640 --> 56:31.360
Huh?

56:33.260 --> 56:36.290
Your husband, how much do you love him?

56:36.290 --> 56:41.810
Do you love him passionately that you can't live without him still?

56:43.060 --> 56:44.940
Well...

56:46.410 --> 56:50.360
Then you don't love him anymore?

56:52.800 --> 56:54.770
I do love him.

56:54.770 --> 56:59.340
But, it's a different shade of love, you could say.

56:59.340 --> 57:02.820
I think being a husband and wife surpasses the relationship between a man and a woman.

57:02.820 --> 57:09.000
Surpasses the relationship between a man and a woman?

57:09.000 --> 57:12.270
At first, I married him because I loved him passionately, of course.

57:12.270 --> 57:14.970
With the feeling that I'd die without him.

57:14.970 --> 57:20.720
But after time passes, all that passion does dissipate.

57:20.720 --> 57:25.150
If I loved him passionately to death everyday, it would be too hard to live.

57:29.060 --> 57:31.560
Spending lots of time together

57:31.560 --> 57:36.540
we were able to share happy and difficult memories together.

57:36.540 --> 57:39.960
And while becoming parents to our beautiful children,

57:39.960 --> 57:44.840
I think a husband and wife end up as a unit sharing a common destiny.

57:44.840 --> 57:50.140
We're family. Family that shares a profound relationship.

57:53.580 --> 57:56.070
I'm envious.

57:56.070 --> 57:58.460
I want to end up like you.

57:58.460 --> 58:03.060
Sharing many memories together with the one you love,

58:03.060 --> 58:09.510
and becoming parents to beautiful children as a family-like couple.

58:33.200 --> 58:34.670
Hello?

58:34.670 --> 58:36.720
It's me.

58:38.670 --> 58:40.500
How did you get my number?

58:40.500 --> 58:43.960
Watch how you speak to me!

58:45.790 --> 58:48.490
I have nothing to say to you, so stop calling me.

58:48.490 --> 58:51.890
I heard that Executive Director Shin is being sworn in as the general manager.

58:53.060 --> 58:54.840
So?

58:54.840 --> 59:00.150
Since you won't listen to me, I thought I should go to the celebration.

59:00.150 --> 59:03.800
To congratulate him and ask him for a favor.

59:06.170 --> 59:09.230
You messed up my life plenty already!

59:09.230 --> 59:14.080
So please let me go, Uncle!

59:14.080 --> 59:16.780
I'll see you there.

59:24.850 --> 59:27.850
My Side

59:29.920 --> 59:34.810
The phone is turned off, so you'll be...

59:43.970 --> 59:46.950
Why make such a fuss?

59:46.950 --> 59:49.170
I'm not happy about it.

59:49.170 --> 59:52.910
He's dedicated nearly 20 years to the company.

59:52.910 --> 59:57.810
He has the right to be congratulated this way.

59:57.810 --> 01:00:03.980
I gave him the position, but I don't feel settled.

01:00:03.980 --> 01:00:06.360
He'll do a good job.

01:00:06.360 --> 01:00:09.380
You know that he's more capable than anyone else.

01:00:09.380 --> 01:00:11.740
He's not just an executive director anymore

01:00:11.740 --> 01:00:15.640
but holds on of the top positions at Rahen group now.

01:00:22.480 --> 01:00:26.920
Tae Hee, Tae Yong, do you want to go get some dessert with me?

01:00:26.920 --> 01:00:28.360
Okay, uncle.

01:00:28.360 --> 01:00:30.710
- Let's go.
- Let's.

01:00:43.520 --> 01:00:47.540
Mom, please. Not today, please.

01:00:47.540 --> 01:00:54.010
After whipping him all this time, I tried giving him a carrot, and he took it in an instant.

01:00:54.010 --> 01:00:57.240
I didn't think he would get it resolved so quickly.

01:00:58.130 --> 01:01:01.440
Did you help him again?

01:01:01.440 --> 01:01:02.670
As you've always done?

01:01:02.670 --> 01:01:05.000
I didn't do such a thing.

01:01:15.660 --> 01:01:18.590
Tae Hee's dad is more true to his own desires

01:01:18.590 --> 01:01:22.430
tha

01:03:41.910 --> 01:03:49.010
