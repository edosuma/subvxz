00:03.072 --> 00:03.934
Male announcer:
AS FOR JAY CUTLER'S KNEE,

00:03.969 --> 00:04.970
THE MRI CAME BACK CLEAR.

00:05.005 --> 00:06.420
GOOD NEWS FOR THE BEARS,

00:06.454 --> 00:07.869
AS HE'S EXPECTED
TO PLAY THIS SUNDAY

00:07.904 --> 00:09.906
AGAINST DREW BREES
AND THE RED-HOT SAINTS.

00:09.940 --> 00:11.597
CUTLER SAYS HE FEELS GOOD.

00:11.632 --> 00:12.885
THE KNEE'S NOT GIVING HIM
ANY PROBLEMS...

00:12.909 --> 00:14.566
- ANY WORD ON JAY CUTLER?

00:14.600 --> 00:17.569
- PUMP SAYS HE'S A GO.

00:17.603 --> 00:18.960
- GUESS I SHOULD BE GLAD
THEY DON'T HAVE PORN

00:18.984 --> 00:19.985
ON GAS PUMP TV.

00:20.020 --> 00:21.745
OR WE'D BE HERE ALL AFTERNOON.

00:21.780 --> 00:23.989
- LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING
ABOUT ME, HONEY.

00:24.024 --> 00:24.714
THE DAY THAT WE
AS A CIVILIZATION

00:24.748 --> 00:26.129
GET TO THE POINT

00:26.164 --> 00:27.786
WHERE WE'RE BROADCASTING
PORNOGRAPHY

00:27.820 --> 00:29.305
FROM TELEVISIONS
ATTACHED TO GAS PUMPS

00:29.339 --> 00:31.755
IS THE DAY I START WORKING
AT A GAS STATION.

00:34.103 --> 00:38.141
HOW MUCH PORN
AREYOU WATCHING THESE DAYS?

00:38.176 --> 00:40.005
- YOU MEAN, SINCE WE'VE BEEN
ON BREAK?

00:40.040 --> 00:42.628
- YEAH.
- WHY DO YOU ASK?

00:42.663 --> 00:44.089
- WELL, WHEN MY BROTHER DONAL
AND HIS GIRLFRIEND BROKE UP,

00:44.113 --> 00:45.079
HE WAS WATCHING IT ALL THE TIME.

00:45.114 --> 00:47.012
DID I TELL YOU
THAT I WALKED IN

00:47.047 --> 00:48.093
ON HIM AND HIS LAPTOP
IN MY PARENTS' BATHROOM

00:48.117 --> 00:50.084
LAST CHRISTMAS?

00:50.119 --> 00:51.844
TWICE.

00:51.879 --> 00:52.742
- DONAL'S A MORON.
I'M NOT DONAL.

00:52.776 --> 00:54.088
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?

00:54.123 --> 00:54.951
AND THIS IS THE TRUTH HERE.

00:54.985 --> 00:56.021
- YEAH?

00:56.056 --> 00:57.850
- KINDA STOPPED WATCHING IT.

00:57.885 --> 00:59.507
- NO, YOU DIDN'T.
- YES, I DID.

00:59.542 --> 01:02.855
I LOST ALL INTEREST
IN OTHER GIRLS. COMPLETELY.

01:02.890 --> 01:04.419
AND PORN. FIRST TIME
IT'S EVER HAPPENED TO ME.

01:04.443 --> 01:06.480
- I AM SO FLATTERED.

01:06.514 --> 01:07.791
- BABE, THIS IS HUGE.

01:07.826 --> 01:09.483
MOST GUYS,

01:09.517 --> 01:10.977
THEY GET OUT
OF A LONG-TERM RELATIONSHIP,

01:11.001 --> 01:13.659
THEIR PORN ADDICTION
GOES THROUGH THE ROOF.

01:13.694 --> 01:16.352
ME, I WENT THE OTHER WAY.

01:16.386 --> 01:17.939
- YOU HAD AN ADDICTION?
- WHAT?

01:17.974 --> 01:20.425
- YOU USED THE WORD "ADDICTION."

01:20.459 --> 01:22.806
- YEAH. ABOUT DONAL. NOT ME.

01:22.841 --> 01:24.118
I STOPPED. COLD TURKEY.

01:24.153 --> 01:25.015
UH, THAT DIDN'T COME OUT RIGHT.

01:25.050 --> 01:27.190
- NO, IT DIDN'T.

01:27.225 --> 01:28.950
- WHAT ABOUT YOU, SMARTY PANTS?

01:28.985 --> 01:30.469
- WHAT ABOUT ME?

01:30.504 --> 01:32.437
YOU WATCH ANY PORN?

01:32.471 --> 01:33.679
COME ON.

01:33.714 --> 01:35.129
YOU KNOW WHAT PORN IS TO ME.

01:35.164 --> 01:37.994
IT'S REAL ESTATE,
SHOES, AND GUNS.

01:38.028 --> 01:39.375
IF I COULD FIND A MAGAZINE

01:39.409 --> 01:40.809
WITH GLOSSY PICTURES
OF ALL THREE...

01:42.067 --> 01:43.172
THAT'D REALLY GET ME OFF.

01:43.206 --> 01:44.932

01:44.966 --> 01:47.245

03:16.092 --> 03:17.404

03:19.716 --> 03:21.073

03:21.097 --> 03:22.143
JUST START TAKING TONS

- HE'S CONSCIOUS.
- BLOOD SUGAR'S AT 30.

03:32.453 --> 03:34.628
- GIVE HIM ONE EP OF D-50.
- YOU'RE GONNA BE ALL RIGHT.

03:34.662 --> 03:36.053
- THEY GOT
THE GOOD DOCTORS ON TODAY.

03:36.077 --> 03:37.941
- I-I NEED YOU
TO DO SOMETHING FOR ME.

03:37.976 --> 03:39.776
- SURE, BRO. CALL YOUR WIFE?
- NO, NO, NO, NO.

03:39.805 --> 03:41.266
NO, I NEED YOU TO GO BACK
TO MY APARTMENT,

03:41.290 --> 03:42.739
CLEAR THE HISTORY
ON MY COMPUTER,

03:42.774 --> 03:44.258
AND THEN CALL MY WIFE.

03:44.293 --> 03:45.604
- SERIOUSLY?
- PLEASE! PLEASE!

03:45.639 --> 03:46.709
YEAH, OKAY.

03:46.743 --> 03:50.713
OKAY.

03:52.853 --> 03:54.372
SO WHAT DO YOU GUYS THINK IT IS?

03:54.406 --> 03:56.891
LIKE SOME SURPRISE
BIRTHDAY THING FOR THE WIFE?

03:56.926 --> 03:58.238
OR... OH, MY GOD.

03:58.272 --> 03:59.066
YOU THINK HE'S HAVING AN AFFAIR?

03:59.100 --> 04:00.757
- YEAH, WITH ONLINE PORN.

04:00.792 --> 04:02.380
- REALLY?
- IT'S ALWAYS ABOUT PORN, BRI.

04:02.414 --> 04:04.968
WHY ELSE WOULD A GUY
THAT WAS ON HIS DEATHBED

04:05.003 --> 04:06.901
ASK THREE STRANGERS
TO GO TO HIS HOUSE

04:06.936 --> 04:08.455
AND ERASE HIS COMPUTER HISTORY?

04:08.489 --> 04:10.905
- OR MAYBE HE'S A TERRORIST.
OH, MY GOD!

04:10.940 --> 04:12.435
WHAT IF IT'S SOME KIND
OF TERRORIST PLOT?

04:12.459 --> 04:14.426
MAYBE WE SHOULD CALL THE FBI.
OR THE NSA.

04:14.461 --> 04:15.910
- YOU KNOW WHAT
THE NSA CONSIDERS

04:15.945 --> 04:16.956
THE FIRST SIGNIFICANT SIGN
THAT YOU'RE PART

04:16.980 --> 04:18.741
OF A TERRORIST PLOT?

04:18.775 --> 04:20.467
- IF YOU DON'T HAVE PORN
ON YOUR COMPUTER.

04:20.501 --> 04:23.090
- WELL, THEN THEY'RE COMING
AFTER ME, I GUESS.

04:23.124 --> 04:25.610
- YOU DON'T WATCH IT?

04:25.644 --> 04:27.163
- NOT ANY MORE, NO.
I STOPPED.

04:27.197 --> 04:28.923
I FOUND THAT FREE ONLINE PORN

04:28.958 --> 04:31.478
WAS BECOMING A CANCER
IN THIS COUNTRY.

04:31.512 --> 04:33.997
THE YOUNG MEN IN MY GENERATION,
IN PARTICULAR,

04:34.032 --> 04:36.448
WERE BEGINNING TO GET
UNREALISTIC EXPECTATIONS

04:36.483 --> 04:40.245
ABOUT BOTH WOMEN'S BODIES
AND SEXUAL ACTIVITY.

04:40.280 --> 04:43.283
I THINK IT MAY HAVE SCARRED
AN ENTIRE GENERATION OF MEN.

04:43.317 --> 04:45.975
SO I DECIDED TO STOP.

04:46.009 --> 04:49.668
AND BEGIN THE HEALING PROCESS.

04:49.703 --> 04:51.567
- HOLY SH...

04:51.601 --> 04:53.481
EXACTLY HOW MUCH TIME
DID YOU SPEND BEATING OFF?

04:54.363 --> 04:56.157
- UM...

04:58.056 --> 05:01.162
OH, THERE IT IS.

05:01.197 --> 05:02.681
- LET'S JUST HIT CLEAR HISTORY,

05:02.716 --> 05:04.107
ERASE HIS CRAP,
AND GET THE HELL OUT OF HERE.

05:04.131 --> 05:05.270
- EVEN THOUGH HE'S A PC GUY.

05:05.305 --> 05:07.686
- MY FATHER'S A PC GUY, SO...

05:07.721 --> 05:08.963
I CAN HANDLE THIS.

05:08.998 --> 05:10.931
JUST, UH, TWO CLICKS,

05:10.965 --> 05:13.105
AND EASY PEASY.

05:13.140 --> 05:16.764
HERE WE GO.

05:17.972 --> 05:19.353
- YEAH, SEE? TOLD YOU.

05:19.388 --> 05:21.286
- OKAY, OKAY,
YOU GUYS WERE RIGHT.

05:21.321 --> 05:23.944
I THINK WE ALL KNOW
WHERE THIS IS GOING.

05:23.978 --> 05:26.049
NOW HERE COMES THE...

05:26.084 --> 05:27.706
All: OH!

05:29.329 --> 05:31.676
WHAT IS THAT?

05:35.369 --> 05:37.889
- IT'S LOUD!
- IT'S SO LOUD!

05:37.923 --> 05:40.788
TURN IT OFF!

05:40.823 --> 05:41.823
- END IT!

05:47.726 --> 05:52.075
♪

06:05.054 --> 06:06.642
- I DON'T BLAME YOU.

06:06.676 --> 06:08.713
I BLAME SOCIETY.

06:08.747 --> 06:10.646
AND THAT DAMN INTERNET.

06:10.680 --> 06:12.061
HOLD ON.

06:12.095 --> 06:15.409
I GOT SOMETHIN'
MIGHT HELP YOU OUT.

06:17.273 --> 06:18.688
- YOU THINK HE HAS
A SPECIAL PILL

06:18.723 --> 06:20.794
OR A POTION OR SOMETHING?

06:20.828 --> 06:22.968
- BRIAN, HE'S NOT OZ.
- HE'S VERY WISE.

06:23.003 --> 06:25.454
- I THINK I MAY HAVE
TO GIVE UP PORN.

06:25.488 --> 06:26.983
- NOW, EVERYBODY,
JUST LET'S NOT PANIC, OKAY?

06:27.007 --> 06:28.042
IT WAS A HORSE.

06:28.077 --> 06:29.975
HAVING AN ORGASM.

06:30.010 --> 06:32.012
IT'S NOT THE END OF THE WORLD.

06:32.046 --> 06:33.058
AAH, MAYBE IT IS THE END
OF THE WORLD.

06:33.082 --> 06:34.980
I CAN'T STOP SEEING IT.

06:35.015 --> 06:37.362
- DID ANYONE ELSE NOTICE
HOW BLUE THE HORSE'S EYES WERE?

06:37.397 --> 06:42.022
- WHAT?
- JUST TRYING TO HELP.

06:42.056 --> 06:46.336
- WHENEVER
I FIND MYSELF ENGULFED

06:46.371 --> 06:48.511
IN BOTHERSOME THOUGHTS,

06:48.546 --> 06:52.032
I SIT DOWN AND HAVE ME
SOME PURE HEAVEN ON EARTH.

06:52.066 --> 06:53.343
GO AHEAD, TAKE A BITE.

07:00.523 --> 07:03.906
I SAW A LOT OF BAD SH...
IN VIETNAM.

07:03.940 --> 07:05.217
BUT IT'S WHAT I EXPECTED.

07:05.252 --> 07:08.462
WAR. AND ALL ITS UGLY PARTS.

07:08.497 --> 07:12.017
BUT ONE TIME,
ON THIS JOB...

07:12.052 --> 07:15.089
I DONE WHAT YOU FOOLS DID.

07:15.124 --> 07:18.265
I STUCK MY NOSE IN SOME PLACE
WHERE IT DIDN'T BELONG.

07:18.299 --> 07:21.475
SEE, EVERYBODY'S GOT A SECRET.

07:21.510 --> 07:24.133
SO WHEN YOU GO
IN SOMEONE'S HOME ON A CALL,

07:24.167 --> 07:26.756
YOU WANNA DO
WHAT YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO DO.

07:26.791 --> 07:28.965
SAVE THEIR ASS,
AND GET 'EM IN THE RIG.

07:29.000 --> 07:30.933
HOW'S THE CANDY?

07:30.967 --> 07:33.453
- DELICIOUS.

07:33.487 --> 07:35.938
- ANYWAY, SO ONE TIME
I'M SAVING THIS WOMAN

07:35.972 --> 07:37.871
CALLED IN A HEART ATTACK.

07:37.905 --> 07:40.494
SHE'S LAYING
ON HER APARTMENT FLOOR,

07:40.529 --> 07:42.462
AND ONCE I GET HER
ON THE STRETCHER,

07:42.496 --> 07:46.051
I THOUGHT I HEARD A NOISE
COMING FROM HER CLOSET.

07:46.086 --> 07:48.329
SHE'S LIKE, "NO, IT'S OKAY.

07:48.364 --> 07:51.609
IT'S JUST MY CAT."

07:51.643 --> 07:53.403
BUT IT DIDN'T SOUND
LIKE NO CAT.

07:53.438 --> 07:58.063
IT SOUNDED BIG.

07:58.098 --> 08:00.410
REAL BIG.

08:00.445 --> 08:02.896
MY CURIOSITY GOT THE BEST OF ME.

08:02.930 --> 08:05.312
AND I OPENED UP THAT DOOR.

08:05.346 --> 08:06.934
AND WHAT I SAW

08:06.969 --> 08:09.350
ERASED ALL FOUR
OF THOSE HORRIBLE YEARS

08:09.385 --> 08:11.801
I SERVED IN VIETNAM.

08:11.836 --> 08:17.151
- WAS IT A MOKAVE KING
PUMA CAT?

08:17.186 --> 08:20.258
THEY'RE
THE LARGEST DOMESTIC BREED.

08:20.292 --> 08:22.018
- NO.

08:22.053 --> 08:26.022
- IT WAS A 350-POUND MAN.

08:26.057 --> 08:27.058
NAKED.

08:27.092 --> 08:30.337
IN A DIAPER.

08:30.371 --> 08:33.478
NOT IN A DIAPER 'CAUSE HE HAD
INTESTINAL ISSUES.

08:33.513 --> 08:35.894
IN A DIAPER
BECAUSE HE WANTED TO BE A BABY.

08:35.929 --> 08:37.447
AGAIN!

08:41.486 --> 08:44.316
STILL THINKING ABOUT HORSES?
All: NO.

08:44.351 --> 08:45.915
- I'M THINKING ABOUT
THE WORLD'S LARGEST CASE

08:45.939 --> 08:47.285
OF DIAPER RASH.

08:47.319 --> 08:49.287
- SEE? IT WORKED.

08:49.321 --> 08:51.738
THE KEY TO THIS BUSINESS
IS MINDING YOUR BUSINESS.

08:51.772 --> 08:55.120
AND KEEPING YOUR MINDS
OUT OF THE GUTTER.

08:55.155 --> 08:57.019
'CAUSE WHAT YOU PUT IN YOUR HEAD

08:57.053 --> 08:58.848
WILL STAY IN YOUR HEAD,
MOUSSE.

08:58.883 --> 09:00.436
- WHY ARE YOU BUSTING ON ME?

09:00.470 --> 09:01.817
- HOW MANY TIMES
I CATCH YOU

09:01.851 --> 09:03.922
LOOKING AT THAT FILTH
ON YOUR PHONE, BOY?

09:03.957 --> 09:05.141
- YEAH, MAN, WHAT'S THE POINT?

09:05.165 --> 09:06.649
- IT'S LIKE PORN ON A THIMBLE.

09:06.684 --> 09:07.799
DO YOU EVER CLEAR THE HISTORY
ON THAT THING?

09:07.823 --> 09:09.203
- WHY?

09:09.238 --> 09:10.757
- IN CASE SOMEBODY TAKES
A LOOK AT IT.

09:10.791 --> 09:12.828
- I DON'T WATCH FILTH
ON THAT THING ANYMORE.

09:12.862 --> 09:14.381
I MOSTLY USE MY iPAD.

09:14.415 --> 09:16.797
- WHY WOULD YOU WANT
TO WATCH PORN ON AN iPAD?

09:16.832 --> 09:18.464
- WELL, FIRST OF ALL,
THE RESOLUTION IS AMAZING.

09:18.488 --> 09:21.112
AND SECOND, IT'S BIGGER...
OH, MY GOD!

09:21.146 --> 09:23.055
THERESA HAS MY iPAD!
- SO? SHE KNOWS YOU WATCH PORN.

09:23.079 --> 09:24.391
- I TOLD HER I STOPPED.

09:24.425 --> 09:25.506
- WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT?
THAT'S IDIOTIC.

09:25.530 --> 09:26.980
- HOW LONG HAVE YOU KNOWN ME?

09:27.014 --> 09:28.336
- GOOD POINT. SURPRISED
IT DIDN'T HAPPEN SOONER.

09:28.360 --> 09:30.293
HOW MUCH TIME WE LOOKIN' AT?

09:30.328 --> 09:31.823
- SHE'S HAVING LUNCH
WITH THE GIRLS AND HER SISTER.

09:31.847 --> 09:32.502
SO WE HAVE A BIT OF A WINDOW.
- WHICH SISTER?

09:32.537 --> 09:34.125
- MAEVE.

09:34.159 --> 09:35.412
- OH, THAT'S
A PRETTY BIG WINDOW.

09:35.436 --> 09:37.991
LET'S GO.
- OKAY.

09:38.025 --> 09:42.236
- DID THE GIANT BABY
HAVE A GIANT RATTLE?

09:42.271 --> 09:44.998
- BRIAN!
- LET'S GO!

09:50.900 --> 09:52.246
- I DON'T GET THE WHOLE

09:52.281 --> 09:53.800
MAYONNAISE-ON-FRENCH-FRY
THING.

09:53.834 --> 09:55.146
MM-MM. NO.

09:55.180 --> 09:56.526
- IT'S EUROPEAN.

09:56.561 --> 09:58.356
THEY DO IT ALL OVER EUROPE.

09:58.390 --> 10:00.185
IT DOESN'T MAKE YOU LOOK CLASSY.

10:00.220 --> 10:01.566
IT'S MAYONNAISE.

10:01.601 --> 10:02.612
- IT'S SO CHIC.
- NO, IT'S NOT.

10:02.636 --> 10:05.363
- YES, IT IS.
- NO, IT'S NOT.

10:05.397 --> 10:07.203
- YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE
EUROPEANS DO THAT'S CREEPY?

10:07.227 --> 10:08.538
THEY DRINK SODA WARM.

10:08.573 --> 10:10.092
- I LOVE WARM SODA.
- SINCE WHEN?

10:10.126 --> 10:14.821
SINCE FOREVER.

10:14.855 --> 10:16.443
- ARE YOU OKAY THERE, STATS?

10:16.477 --> 10:18.341
- I CAN'T FIND A BRA
THAT FITS ME RIGHT.

10:18.376 --> 10:20.896
YOU GUYS ARE PRETTY WELL SET UP.
HOW'D YOU DO THAT?

10:20.930 --> 10:23.519
- LIFT YOURSELF UP, AND THEN
PUT YOURSELF IN THE CUP.

10:23.553 --> 10:25.832
SIZE UP, SIZE DOWN,
IT'S NOT THAT DIFFICULT.

10:25.866 --> 10:29.352
NOT SQUASHED. LIFT IT.

10:29.387 --> 10:31.389
- YOU KNOW WHAT?

10:31.423 --> 10:33.056
WE WILL ALL TAKE YOU SHOPPING
AFTER LUNCH.

10:33.080 --> 10:36.049
- THEY LOVE BOOBS IN EUROPE.

10:36.083 --> 10:37.844
- AWESOME.

10:37.878 --> 10:41.330
WHOO-HOO! HUH?

10:46.922 --> 10:48.406
IT'S 12:30.

10:48.440 --> 10:49.269
LET'S GET THE HELL IN THERE,
GET THIS THING,

10:49.303 --> 10:53.204
AND GET OUT.

10:53.238 --> 10:56.517
- I'M JUST SO THANKFUL
FOR CASH TELLING US THAT STORY.

10:56.552 --> 10:58.865
REALLY CLEARED MY HEAD.

10:58.899 --> 11:02.109
HOW BIG DO YOU THINK
THAT DIAPER WAS?

11:02.144 --> 11:04.525
- HEY, YOUR SHOE'S UNTIED.
- WHUP? SHOELACE SITUATION.

11:08.253 --> 11:11.187

11:11.222 --> 11:13.742

11:13.776 --> 11:15.295
- NO, NO, REQUESTED IT,

11:15.329 --> 11:16.537
CHICKS DIG HORSES.

11:16.572 --> 11:18.539
SO I HEAR.

11:18.574 --> 11:20.414
- YOU WOULDN'T BELIEVE THE PUSSY
A HORSE CAN PULL.

11:20.438 --> 11:21.715
- OH, YEAH, I WOULD.

11:21.750 --> 11:23.072
- YOU GOTTA SEE THE COCK
ON THIS THING.

11:23.096 --> 11:24.062
IT'S LIKE
FOUR LOUISVILLE SLUGGERS

11:24.097 --> 11:25.581
ALL DUCT-TAPED TOGETHER.

11:25.615 --> 11:27.238
YOU GUYS GOT A COUPLE MINUTES?

11:27.272 --> 11:29.043
'CAUSE USUALLY IF YOU JUST
STAND STILL LONG ENOUGH,

11:29.067 --> 11:30.586
IT'LL JUST GET A RANDOM HARD ON.

11:30.620 --> 11:32.795
- ACTUALLY, WE'RE
IN A BIT OF A RUSH.

11:32.830 --> 11:34.624
WE ONLY GOT TEN MINUTES
FOR LUNCH.

11:34.659 --> 11:36.292
- MAYBE NEXT TIME.
- OH, YEAH, OKAY, COOL.

11:36.316 --> 11:38.156
REAL COOL, ALL RIGHT,
WELL, GIVE ME A CALL SOMETIME.

11:38.180 --> 11:41.562
WE'LL GO TO THE TRACK AND HANG.

11:41.597 --> 11:43.461
- GREAT.
- TAKE IT EASY, GUYS.

11:43.495 --> 11:45.256
- ALL RIGHTY.

11:45.290 --> 11:46.290
HELLO! WAKE UP!

11:58.925 --> 12:00.305
GO, GO, GO, GO, GO.

12:00.340 --> 12:04.482
GO, GO, GO, GO, GO.

12:04.516 --> 12:06.346
- OKAY, WHERE IS IT?
- SHHH!

12:06.380 --> 12:08.486
- NOBODY'S HOME.
- SHHH!

12:08.520 --> 12:10.315
- SHE HAS A NOSY NEIGHBOR
WHO CALLS THE COPS

12:10.350 --> 12:11.351
AT THE DROP OF A HAT.

12:11.385 --> 12:12.766
- OKAY, OKAY, OKAY.

12:12.801 --> 12:14.192
LOOK, THIS IS HOW
THIS IS GONNA GO DOWN.

12:14.216 --> 12:15.665
BRIAN, YOU TAKE
THE FRONT QUADRANT,

12:15.700 --> 12:17.598
AND JOHNNY, YOU TAKE
THE BACK QUADRANTS.

12:17.633 --> 12:18.530
WHY ARE YOU ASSIGNING QUADRANTS?
IT'S MY GIRLFRIEND'S HOUSE.

12:18.565 --> 12:19.600
- I WAS IN THE MILITARY.

12:19.635 --> 12:20.716
I KNOW HOW TO ASSIGN QUADRANTS

12:20.740 --> 12:21.706
IN A SPY MISSION SITUATION.

12:21.741 --> 12:23.535
NOW, LOOK, BRIAN.

12:23.570 --> 12:25.020
- YOU TAKE THE KITCHEN QUADRANT.

12:25.054 --> 12:26.445
I'M GONNA TAKE
THE BEDROOM QUADRANT.

12:26.469 --> 12:27.515
BRIAN, YOU TAKE
THE LIVING ROOM QUADRANT.

12:27.539 --> 12:29.265
ALL RIGHT?
BREAK.

12:29.300 --> 12:30.656
- THAT'S ONLY THREE QUADRANTS.
- WHAT?

12:30.680 --> 12:31.543
- QUADRANTS MEANS FOUR AREAS.

12:31.578 --> 12:32.648
YOU ONLY ASSIGNED THREE.

12:32.682 --> 12:34.684
THE PREFIX "QUAD" MEANS "FOUR."

12:34.719 --> 12:36.145
- OKAY, FORGET THE QUADRANTS.
- IT HAILS FROM THE LATIN...

12:36.169 --> 12:37.964
FORGET THE QUADRANTS, OKAY?

12:37.998 --> 12:39.689
IT'LL BE JUST AN AREA,
ALL RIGHT?

12:39.724 --> 12:41.115
LET'S GET
THE THREE GODDAMNED AREAS.

12:41.139 --> 12:42.796
- I'VE MADE A DECISION!
- SHHH!

12:42.831 --> 12:44.325
I'M NOT WHISPERING
- KEEP YOUR GODDAMN VOICE DOWN.

12:44.349 --> 12:45.361
- BRIAN, YOU TAKE
THE LIVING ROOM QUADRANT

12:45.385 --> 12:47.214
AND THE KITCHEN QUADRANT.

12:47.249 --> 12:49.389
- THIS WOMAN IS A PSYCHOPATH.

12:53.669 --> 12:55.464
- YOU HAPPY NOW?

12:55.498 --> 12:58.294
- ALL RIGHT.

12:58.329 --> 13:00.641
- OKAY, OKAY.

13:00.676 --> 13:02.333
- OH, MY GOD.

13:02.367 --> 13:04.093
- WHAT?
- THERESA'S COMPUTER.

13:04.128 --> 13:07.787
- OH, DON'T DO IT, JOHN.
- DO YOU THINK IT'S WRONG?

13:07.821 --> 13:11.342
- YES. PLUS, I BELIEVE
THAT IT'S IN MY QUADRANT.

13:11.376 --> 13:12.343
- LOOK, NO GOOD
CAN COME FROM THIS.

13:12.377 --> 13:14.207
- HOW BAD COULD IT BE?

13:14.241 --> 13:15.667
- DIDN'T WE ANSWER THAT QUESTION
EARLIER TODAY?

13:15.691 --> 13:17.313
- LOOK, I KNOW
WHAT THERESA'S INTO.

13:17.348 --> 13:20.040
AND IT'S NOT HORSES
HAVING SEX, OKAY?

13:20.075 --> 13:21.317
IT'S REAL ESTATE AND GUNS.

13:21.352 --> 13:23.181
AND SHOES.

13:23.216 --> 13:28.393
AND I GUARANTEE THAT'S EXACTLY
WHAT WE'RE ABOUT TO SEE.

13:32.225 --> 13:34.399
"THE ROCK"?

13:34.434 --> 13:37.506
THAT MUST BE A GLITCH.

13:37.540 --> 13:39.370
"THE ROCK" AGAIN?

13:39.404 --> 13:41.648
- HIT HISTORY.

13:41.682 --> 13:44.409
"'THE ROCK' ABS.
'THE ROCK' ARMS.

13:44.444 --> 13:46.653
'THE ROCK' ASS"?

13:46.687 --> 13:48.206
"'THE ROCK' EYES?"

13:48.241 --> 13:49.552
- WHO'S DWAYNE JOHNSON?

13:49.587 --> 13:51.727
- ALSO THE ROCK.
HIS GIVEN NAME.

13:51.761 --> 13:54.040
HE DEBUTED AS THE ROCK IN 1996,

13:54.074 --> 13:55.431
WHEN HE BECAME
A PROFESSIONAL WRESTLER.

13:55.455 --> 13:57.491
- OH, MY GOD.
- WOW.

13:57.526 --> 13:59.528
THAT PORN HORSE
AND THE ROCK

13:59.562 --> 14:02.013
HAVE THE SAME EXACT
MUSCULAR DEFINITION.

14:02.048 --> 14:03.601
- LOOK AT THE RIPPLES
ON THAT BACK.

14:03.635 --> 14:05.396
- OKAY, ENOUGH.

14:05.430 --> 14:09.849
THIS IS AN INVASION
OF THERESA'S PRIVACY.

14:09.883 --> 14:12.161
- "PENELOPE CRUZ LIPS,"
"PENELOPE CRUZ EYES."

14:12.196 --> 14:13.714
- OH.
- "PENELOPE CRUZ BIKINI"?

14:13.749 --> 14:16.165
"PREGNANT PENELOPE CRUZ
BIKINI"?

14:16.200 --> 14:18.236
YOU USE
YOUR GIRLFRIEND'S COMPUTER

14:18.271 --> 14:20.342
TO LOOK AT CELEBRITY CHICKS?
- N...

14:20.376 --> 14:22.354
- PREGNANT CELEBRITY CHICKS?
I'M SO DISAPPOINTED IN YOU.

14:22.378 --> 14:24.001
- NOT ME.
IT'S THERESA.

14:24.035 --> 14:25.599
PENELOPE CRUZ IS
HER LESBIAN FREE TICKET.

14:25.623 --> 14:26.589
IT'S THE ONE GIRL
SHE'D EVER HAVE SEX WITH

14:26.624 --> 14:28.453
IF SHE EVER HAD THE CHANCE.

14:28.488 --> 14:31.629
ME, BEING A GRACIOUS BOYFRIEND,
SAID SHE COULD DO IT.

14:31.663 --> 14:33.296
- WHO'S YOUR FREE TICKET?
- JENNIFER ANISTON.

14:33.320 --> 14:36.427
- OH, YOU MORON.
- WHAT? WHY AM I A MORON?

14:36.461 --> 14:39.602
- BECAUSE IF YOU PICK
PENELOPE CRUZ TOO,

14:39.637 --> 14:41.408
AND THE DAY HAPPENS TO COME
WHERE YOU BOTH MEET HER

14:41.432 --> 14:43.641
AND YOU HIT IT OFF,
YOU GET TO HAVE A THREESOME!

14:43.675 --> 14:45.712
- EVEN I KNOW THAT.
- OH, I DIDN'T...

14:45.746 --> 14:47.300
- PUT 'EM UP, MOTHERFU...
- OH!

14:47.334 --> 14:49.474
- HOLY SH..., YOU GUYS!

14:49.509 --> 14:52.650
I ALMOST WASTED Y'ALL!
- JESUS. BILLY!

14:52.684 --> 14:54.410
OH, MY GOD.

14:54.445 --> 14:56.102
WHY... WHY DON'T...

14:56.136 --> 14:58.794
WHY DON'T YOU HAVE
ANY CLOTHES ON?

14:58.828 --> 15:04.213
WHY IS YOUR PENIS SO BIG?

15:04.248 --> 15:05.939
- IT'S NOT THATBIG.

15:05.974 --> 15:08.321
- I SAY THIS AS A BLACK MAN
AND A GAY DUDE,

15:08.355 --> 15:10.116
YOUR COCK IS ENORMOUS.

15:10.150 --> 15:11.427
- REALLY?
THANKS, MAN.

15:11.462 --> 15:12.877
MY BROTHERS ARE BIGGER.

15:12.912 --> 15:14.568
I'M THE SMALLEST ONE
IN MY FAMILY.

15:14.603 --> 15:16.132
- I WOULD LOVE TO VISIT
THEIR HOUSE FOR THANKSGIVING.

15:16.156 --> 15:18.434
- GOD, YOUR BALLS LOOK TINY.

15:18.469 --> 15:21.644
- HOW... HOW DO YOU BUY PANTS?

15:21.679 --> 15:23.612
I DON'T KNOW WHO'S BIGGER,
HIM OR THE PORN HORSE.

15:23.646 --> 15:26.649
- HE IS, BY A NOSE.

15:26.684 --> 15:27.764
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE,
BILLY?

15:27.788 --> 15:30.032
- I WAS SLEEPING UPSTAIRS.
- NAKED?

15:30.067 --> 15:31.285
- YEAH. IT'S HARD FOR ME TO FIND
THE RIGHT SIZE UNDERWEAR.

15:31.309 --> 15:32.724
- MY HOUSE IS CLOSE
TO THE STATION,

15:32.759 --> 15:34.657
NO UNDERWEAR NECESSARY.
- STOP HITTING ON HIM.

15:34.692 --> 15:38.247
- HE'S NOT HITTING ON ME.
- OH, I'M HITTING ON YOU HARD.

15:38.282 --> 15:39.500
- DID YOU SLEEP
WITH MY GIRLFRIEND?

15:39.524 --> 15:42.389
- UM... I DON'T THINK SO.

15:44.840 --> 15:47.118
- HOLY SH...!
- OH, MY GOD.

15:47.153 --> 15:49.396
HE'S COVERING IT UP
AND I CAN STILL SEE IT.

15:49.431 --> 15:51.295
- 99TH PERCENTILE,
THAT'S HOW BIG THAT IS.

15:51.329 --> 15:53.228
99TH PERCENTILE.
- WOW.

15:53.262 --> 15:55.126
- UM, I THINK I'M GONNA
PUT SOME PANTS ON.

15:55.161 --> 15:56.507
- NO!
- NO!

15:56.541 --> 15:58.992
- I THINK THAT'S A GOOD IDEA.
- OKAY.

15:59.027 --> 16:01.443
- WHAT ARE YOU GUYS
DOING HERE?

16:01.477 --> 16:03.307
- WHAT IS HEDOING HERE?

16:03.341 --> 16:04.929
- HIS APARTMENT'S
BEING FUMIGATED,

16:04.964 --> 16:06.793
AND HE'S WORKING NIGHTS
COVERING FOR A GUY,

16:06.827 --> 16:08.874
SO I SAID HE COULD STAY HERE.
WHAT ARE YOUDOING HERE?

16:08.898 --> 16:12.005
- WELL, I JUST
CAME OVER TO...

16:12.040 --> 16:14.870
TO, UH, SHOW THE GUYS
THE NEW COFFEE TABLE.

16:14.904 --> 16:16.423
THERE IT IS, BOYS.
WHAT'D I TELL YOU?

16:16.458 --> 16:17.597
- OH, WOW!
IS THIS OAK?

16:17.631 --> 16:18.805
- DID YOU GET THIS USED?

16:18.839 --> 16:20.151
- YEAH, YEAH.
IT'S NICE.

16:20.186 --> 16:22.326
- WHY IS MY COMPUTER OPEN?

16:22.360 --> 16:26.433
- THE TRUTH IS THAT iPAD...
MY iPAD THAT I LENT YOU...

16:26.468 --> 16:28.332
IT'S, UH...

16:28.366 --> 16:31.438
IT'S GOT PORN ON IT.
- I KNOW.

16:31.473 --> 16:34.131
- YOU LOOKED AT MY iPAD?
- TWO SECONDS AFTER YOU LEFT.

16:34.165 --> 16:35.867
WANTED TO KNOW IF YOU WERE
TELLING THE TRUTH

16:35.891 --> 16:40.206
ABOUT GIVING UP PORN,
WHICH OF COURSE YOU WEREN'T.

16:40.240 --> 16:41.862
YOU LOOKED AT MY COMPUTER?
- YEAH, I DID.

16:41.897 --> 16:43.795
AND I'M SORRY ABOUT THAT.

16:43.830 --> 16:44.841
BUT JUST WHAT THE HELL
IS THE DEAL WITH ALL THE...

16:44.865 --> 16:46.212
- HEY!
- ROCK PICTURES, HUH?

16:46.246 --> 16:47.730
- HEY!
- CAN YOU TELL ME THAT?

16:47.765 --> 16:48.880
- FIRST OF ALL,
IT'S NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS.

16:48.904 --> 16:50.181
SECOND OF ALL...

16:50.216 --> 16:52.839
I LIKE THE ROCK.
HE'S HANDSOME.

16:52.873 --> 16:54.703
HE'S AGILE.

16:54.737 --> 16:56.394
AND HE'S FUNNY.

16:56.429 --> 16:57.682
- AND HE CAN DO THAT THING
WITH HIS EYEBROWS.

16:57.706 --> 16:59.328
- YES, HE CAN.

16:59.363 --> 17:00.916
- I LOVE WHEN HE DOES
THE EYEBROWS.

17:00.950 --> 17:02.687
- THE ROCK IS HUGE IN EUROPE.
THEY LOVE HIM THERE.

17:02.711 --> 17:06.887
WHAT'S WITH PENELOPE CRUZ?

17:06.922 --> 17:09.373
- SHE'S MY LESBIAN
FREE TICKET, OKAY?

17:09.407 --> 17:11.409
- WHO'S HIS FREE TICKET?
- JENNIFER ANISTON. PFFT.

17:11.444 --> 17:12.686
- IDIOT!
