00:59.160 --> 01:01.069
Hey, man. Hey, Cincinnati.

01:01.160 --> 01:02.910
Come on, man. Come on, daddy.

01:03.000 --> 01:05.262
I'm gonna get you one
more time. Come on, man.

01:05.319 --> 01:07.582
Come on. Just one more
time. Come on, man.

01:07.640 --> 01:09.105
Okay.

01:16.480 --> 01:17.991
Let's see you cut that.

01:25.920 --> 01:27.863
You're just not ready for me yet.

03:45.040 --> 03:46.744
Don't you know it.

03:47.160 --> 03:48.705
Just a minute.

03:49.080 --> 03:51.421
- That's right.
- Oh, a three.

03:51.640 --> 03:56.268
Our lucky friend from Baton Rouge gets
a big fat queen with his pair of sixes.

03:56.320 --> 03:59.264
- Little lady make you feel happy, buster?
- Deal yourself, clown.

04:00.800 --> 04:02.345
Dealer's flush.

04:03.320 --> 04:04.910
Well, that broke that up.

04:04.960 --> 04:06.744
Go ahead, bet your sixes, buster.

04:06.800 --> 04:09.267
Told you not to call me that.

04:09.320 --> 04:11.229
One-seventy-five.

04:12.680 --> 04:14.703
Twenty.

04:16.000 --> 04:20.661
And cost you 194 fish.

04:27.280 --> 04:29.621
Hundred-and-ninety-four
fisheroos to you, friend.

04:37.200 --> 04:40.747
You gonna bust everybody, or am I?

04:41.880 --> 04:44.460
- So? What are you gonna do?
- Call.

04:46.800 --> 04:48.140
What do you mean, call?

04:48.200 --> 04:51.270
I think you're trying
to buy it. Eights.

05:06.560 --> 05:08.742
What, are you guys
blind or something?

05:08.800 --> 05:10.629
What do you mean, buster?

05:11.000 --> 05:13.671
I think somebody's been
daubing these cards.

05:15.080 --> 05:17.342
Are you crazy?

05:20.120 --> 05:23.349
He ain't gonna put out 194
bucks on a lousy pair.

05:23.880 --> 05:25.345
You did.

05:28.200 --> 05:31.463
I'm saying you've been
marking these cards.

05:32.080 --> 05:34.831
I don't need marked
cards to beat you, pal.

06:05.800 --> 06:08.710
Stay here. I'll take care of him.

06:21.920 --> 06:24.068
Give me the money.

06:41.480 --> 06:43.070
Drop it.

08:45.040 --> 08:47.620
- What's his name?
- Tricky Bob.

08:47.680 --> 08:49.862
Here you are, Tricky.

08:50.960 --> 08:53.222
Raleigh Hotel, please.

08:53.800 --> 08:55.504
Thank you.

08:56.520 --> 08:59.226
Mr. Howard, sir. Welcome
back to New Orleans.

09:00.560 --> 09:03.391
- Two-twelve for Mr. Howard.
- Yes, sir.

09:03.640 --> 09:05.310
Mr. Howard.

09:10.960 --> 09:12.505
Hey, King Kiddo.

09:12.560 --> 09:14.822
Come on, baby.
I'll spot you three balls.

09:14.880 --> 09:17.460
- Ain't my game, Eddie.
- Hi, Kid.

09:17.600 --> 09:19.907
Come on, Kid. We've been
holding a chair for you.

09:21.640 --> 09:23.265
How they running, Philly?

09:23.320 --> 09:25.582
They've been running right
by me all day, Kid.

09:25.640 --> 09:28.107
- What's the bet?
- You stopped a couple, didn't you?

09:28.160 --> 09:29.910
Seventeen to you, Philly.

09:30.000 --> 09:33.661
Well, I'll give you my definitive answer
to any inquiry along those lines...

09:33.760 --> 09:36.864
as soon as I see
Whitey's hole card.

09:37.400 --> 09:39.104
I call.

09:39.160 --> 09:40.750
Aces up.

09:40.800 --> 09:43.506
I don't believe that beats
three fours, do it?

09:47.880 --> 09:49.391
You wouldn't happen to hold...

09:49.480 --> 09:51.105
- ...any markers, would you?
- Yeah.

09:51.160 --> 09:53.866
The man holds markers on
everybody in this town.

09:53.920 --> 09:57.945
- What you got on me, Kid?
- Got you for 110, a 60 and an 85.

10:00.200 --> 10:02.701
I'll take the 110, the 60.
You take the 85...

10:02.760 --> 10:04.908
and put it back in
your bank. Thanks, Kid.

10:05.000 --> 10:06.909
- Deal the cards.
- Hey, Philly.

10:12.880 --> 10:14.141
Hi, Kid.

10:14.200 --> 10:16.143
- Hi.
- Watch him, Kid. He's a mean one.

10:16.200 --> 10:17.984
You got a new bird, huh? Gaffer?

10:18.040 --> 10:20.984
No, no. He's a roundhead.
Now, don't get him excited.

10:21.040 --> 10:22.426
Hello, Shooter.

10:25.800 --> 10:28.301
- Where you been?
- Across the river.

10:28.440 --> 10:30.304
- Do any good?
- Couple hundred bucks.

10:30.440 --> 10:34.101
Hey, you know there was a guy in the game
that accused me of juicing the deck?

10:34.160 --> 10:35.671
Playing with amateurs, huh?

10:35.880 --> 10:38.506
Haven't I told you you're
gonna get your melon opened?

10:38.560 --> 10:42.301
It was the only game I could find where
I wasn't holding markers on somebody.

10:42.360 --> 10:45.669
- I'm thinking about going to Miami.
- You're gonna go to work in Miami?

10:45.720 --> 10:47.504
Yeah. Yeah.

10:47.560 --> 10:50.504
- You got a better idea?
- I don't know. It may be just a rumor.

10:50.560 --> 10:52.822
You know how these
things get started...

10:52.920 --> 10:55.307
but they say that Lancey
Howard is in town.

10:55.520 --> 10:56.985
They say Lancey Howard?

10:57.040 --> 10:58.471
The man himself.

10:58.520 --> 11:00.349
The Kid will have to play him.

11:00.400 --> 11:01.945
Am I right, Kid?

11:02.000 --> 11:03.340
You gonna play him?

11:04.080 --> 11:05.511
Lancey Howard.

11:05.600 --> 11:08.670
Lancey Howard take the
skin right off the Kid.

11:08.720 --> 11:10.629
I'm giving even money on the Kid.

11:10.680 --> 11:13.306
Fifty cents. Mark it.

11:13.920 --> 11:17.706
Yes, Mr. Slade. Tomorrow's
fine. Couldn't be better.

11:18.720 --> 11:22.711
I understand that stud
poker is your game.

11:23.080 --> 11:25.706
Well, your stakes are
my pleasure, sir.

11:26.520 --> 11:29.021
Well, why don't we make it about...

11:29.680 --> 11:30.827
lunchtime.

11:31.200 --> 11:33.541
That's a fine idea, Mr. Howard.

11:33.600 --> 11:36.385
Around noon, then?
I'm right here in the hotel.

11:36.800 --> 11:38.789
My pleasure, sir.

11:40.960 --> 11:44.064
And do remember me kindly
to your charming wife.

11:44.400 --> 11:46.582
Yes, I'll do that.

11:47.280 --> 11:49.542
Mr. Howard, one thing more.

11:49.640 --> 11:50.901
Say, I...

11:51.000 --> 11:54.070
May I suggest we secure for
ourselves the dealing services...

11:54.120 --> 11:57.542
of the Shooter for this
auspicious occasion?

11:59.800 --> 12:01.061
That's excellent.

12:01.120 --> 12:02.870
Excellent.

12:02.960 --> 12:05.062
All right, then.

12:05.320 --> 12:07.024
Bye-bye.

12:11.560 --> 12:13.583
Don't touch me.

12:21.480 --> 12:24.106
Just a wee bit more Tabasco.

12:31.120 --> 12:34.781
Yeah, this game's been coming
for a long time, hasn't it, Kid?

12:36.320 --> 12:37.785
Too long.

12:37.840 --> 12:39.669
Think so?

12:39.960 --> 12:41.789
I told you what
happened when I played.

12:42.120 --> 12:43.710
Yeah, I know.

12:43.760 --> 12:47.148
He laid me out, strung me up
and then...

12:49.680 --> 12:52.386
Kid, I mean, he gutted me.

12:52.680 --> 12:55.147
Yeah, you told me, Shooter.

12:56.040 --> 12:58.791
Just wait till he's looking
down your throat, that's all.

12:59.960 --> 13:01.630
You don't think I'm ready, do you?

13:02.360 --> 13:05.464
I don't know. You're one of the
greatest stud players I've seen.

13:05.520 --> 13:07.827
But then again, so
was Lancey Howard.

13:08.720 --> 13:11.585
It's not gonna be like sitting
down with me and Doc Sokal.

13:11.680 --> 13:14.670
You see, I've been where I'm going.

13:15.360 --> 13:17.383
The way I play now?

13:17.480 --> 13:19.821
Just percentages. Don't win
much, don't lose much.

13:19.880 --> 13:22.267
You think you were ready
when you sat down with him?

13:22.360 --> 13:25.589
I thought I was the best
stud-poker player in the world.

13:25.640 --> 13:27.822
I'm telling you,
I thought I was the best.

13:27.880 --> 13:30.221
I got something, Shooter.

13:30.400 --> 13:32.901
You know I've got something.

13:38.400 --> 13:41.344
Yeah, you've got something.
I know that, Kid.

13:42.560 --> 13:46.142
But you've got to remember
that he's the man, see?

13:46.200 --> 13:48.985
He's got an awful lot to protect.

13:49.080 --> 13:52.502
He'll use everything in the book and
then some he's made up to kill you.

13:52.600 --> 13:54.190
I don't want any lesson, Shooter.

13:54.240 --> 13:55.910
I want everything he's got.

14:12.560 --> 14:14.867
- Hi.
- Hi.

14:14.920 --> 14:18.069
- You cold?
- No.

14:24.720 --> 14:26.231
What happened to your coat?

14:26.280 --> 14:28.064
I ripped it.

14:28.120 --> 14:29.710
What'd you do today?

14:29.800 --> 14:33.746
Oh, went to the movies.
And it was all in French.

14:33.800 --> 14:35.390
- In French, huh?
- Yeah.

14:35.440 --> 14:37.668
Know what they do?
They sign the words...

14:37.720 --> 14:40.221
in at the bottom of the picture...

14:40.280 --> 14:42.906
- ...in English, so you can understand it.
- Oh, yeah?

14:42.960 --> 14:45.142
- Yeah.
- Oh, it wasn't in French?

14:45.200 --> 14:48.349
- What?
- What was the movie about?

14:48.680 --> 14:52.227
It was about this town in Europe,
and they get this message...

14:52.280 --> 14:54.747
Well, was it in French,
Spanish or English?

14:54.800 --> 14:57.107
- What?
- The message.

14:58.080 --> 15:01.343
- Do you wanna hear this?
- Yeah. Go ahead.

15:01.480 --> 15:05.187
Well, this Spanish general had sent
the message that he's coming...

15:05.240 --> 15:07.104
to spend the night with his army.

15:08.200 --> 15:10.268
Now, the men in the town
are scared silly...

15:10.320 --> 15:13.583
so the wives and the daughters
tell them not to worry...

15:13.720 --> 15:17.711
and go away and hide someplace and
let them bargain with them. You see?

15:17.760 --> 15:19.350
Who?

15:19.840 --> 15:21.908
Well, the ladies...

15:21.960 --> 15:24.586
with the Spanish army.

15:29.120 --> 15:30.551
I won't tell it anymore.

15:30.600 --> 15:32.304
- Go ahead.
- No, I won't tell it. No.

15:32.360 --> 15:35.942
- Well, just tell me what happened.
- No. No.

15:44.280 --> 15:46.621
You won't believe this.

15:46.680 --> 15:51.388
But the women get together
and have this big party...

15:51.440 --> 15:56.467
and they all go to bed
with the Spanish army.

15:56.520 --> 15:58.463
Oh, yeah?

16:02.200 --> 16:04.507
Anyway, come morning...

16:04.560 --> 16:08.221
the soldiers go off,
and everybody's happy.

16:08.320 --> 16:10.582
Yeah, and the husbands are happy.

16:10.680 --> 16:13.863
Yeah, husbands, fathers, everybody.

16:14.040 --> 16:15.949
Seems they...

16:16.040 --> 16:21.306
Seems they cared more about their lives
than they did about their honor.

16:29.560 --> 16:31.662
That seem right to you?

16:31.760 --> 16:33.385
Yeah.

16:33.800 --> 16:35.664
Well, how come?

16:35.760 --> 16:37.624
Well, because that makes sense.

16:37.720 --> 16:39.788
- That's why.
- It doesn't make sense.

16:39.840 --> 16:44.548
The point is that what good
is honor if you're dead?

16:50.560 --> 16:53.948
Hey, what the hell are you going
to Frenchy movies for, anyway?

16:54.440 --> 16:57.225
Shooter's wife wanted to go.

16:58.120 --> 16:59.301
- Melba?
- Melba.

16:59.360 --> 17:03.306
- Since when are you hanging with Melba?
- Since that game in Corpus.

17:03.960 --> 17:05.391
- Melba.
- I know.

17:05.560 --> 17:06.866
Wow.

17:07.400 --> 17:09.548
You don't want me to
go out with Melba?

17:09.599 --> 17:11.031
Hey...

17:11.079 --> 17:13.147
I don't care what you do.

17:14.400 --> 17:17.742
Well, you should.

17:23.119 --> 17:26.064
I happen to like Melba.

17:46.000 --> 17:47.511
Melba...

17:47.720 --> 17:49.424
why do you do that?

17:49.760 --> 17:51.430
So it will fit, stupid.

17:51.560 --> 17:53.344
No, I'm not talking about that.

17:53.400 --> 17:55.423
What I'm asking is...

17:55.880 --> 17:58.460
Do you have to cheat at everything?

18:00.160 --> 18:01.910
At everything?

18:02.480 --> 18:05.265
Yes, at...

18:07.920 --> 18:09.431
solitaire.

18:09.520 --> 18:12.021
I've yet to see you play
solitaire without cheating.

18:12.080 --> 18:14.421
So what?

18:14.840 --> 18:18.547
Look, you're just cheating
yourself. Don't you understand?

18:18.600 --> 18:21.624
You'll be the loser, no
one else but yourself.

18:30.680 --> 18:34.262
You've ruined the puzzle. Now,
that doesn't go in there.

18:34.400 --> 18:36.389
It does now.

19:15.720 --> 19:17.424
Why should I answer?

19:17.480 --> 19:19.981
- Hello.
- You only get steamed if it's for me.

19:20.040 --> 19:21.665
Oh, yes. Lancey.

19:21.760 --> 19:23.350
Yes, I heard you were in town.

19:23.440 --> 19:26.464
Hey, what are you up to?
A little action, maybe?

19:26.960 --> 19:28.346
But I keep forgetting.

19:28.440 --> 19:31.146
You like to steam,
don't you, Shooter?

19:31.440 --> 19:34.271
William Jefferson Slade.

19:34.720 --> 19:36.709
Local celebrity, I understand.

19:37.080 --> 19:39.865
Comes from one of the richest
families in the state.

19:46.440 --> 19:48.224
Yeah, that's right, Lancey.

19:48.600 --> 19:51.385
Seems that your reputation
is one of the few...

19:51.440 --> 19:54.066
stable things in a world
of crumbling values.

19:57.240 --> 19:58.990
I'll be there.

20:23.800 --> 20:26.380
Would you really wear
a thing like that?

20:26.440 --> 20:29.191
Why not? I got nothing to hide.

20:29.240 --> 20:31.547
Hey, I bet you'd look
good in one too.

20:31.600 --> 20:35.261
Oh, no, I couldn't.
I just couldn't wear that.

20:35.320 --> 20:36.865
Come on.

20:36.960 --> 20:38.664
Well, now where are you going?

20:38.720 --> 20:41.744
You ever been to the Turkish bath?

20:41.840 --> 20:45.865
Turkish baths? French movies?
I don't know about you, Melba.

20:45.920 --> 20:47.704
Well, then, come on and find out.

20:47.760 --> 20:51.023
The Turkish bath leaves
nothing to the imagination.

20:51.080 --> 20:54.104
But I wouldn't know what
to do in a Turkish bath.

20:54.160 --> 20:55.785
But that's what's so marvelous.

20:55.840 --> 20:58.341
You don't do anything.
They do it to you.

20:58.440 --> 21:00.781
- Come on.
- They do it to you?

21:00.840 --> 21:04.626
Well, you and the Shooter are
married. Now, that's something.

21:04.840 --> 21:07.102
It's nothing.

21:07.280 --> 21:11.146
Believe you me,
honey, it's nothing.

21:12.200 --> 21:17.386
You know you got somebody that wants
to spend the rest of his life with you too.

21:18.680 --> 21:23.149
How'd you like to spend the
rest of your life with Shooter?

21:33.280 --> 21:36.941
Least you know how much
you mean to somebody.

21:39.280 --> 21:40.825
Last card.

21:40.880 --> 21:42.505
Possible flush.

21:42.560 --> 21:44.105
Pair of eights.

21:44.160 --> 21:47.503
Nothing there. Pair of queens.

21:47.720 --> 21:49.629
Possible flush.

21:49.720 --> 21:52.426
Queens check to the possibles.

21:59.680 --> 22:01.020
Two thousand.

22:01.120 --> 22:02.460
Two and up two.

22:03.000 --> 22:04.670
Fold.

22:04.920 --> 22:06.670
Fold.

22:07.760 --> 22:09.510
I fold.

22:11.400 --> 22:13.867
This Cincinnati Kid,
he wants a game, huh?

22:13.920 --> 22:15.863
- He does.
- Is he any good?

22:15.920 --> 22:17.670
Come on. You know he is.

22:21.240 --> 22:23.707
That's the biggest pot yet.

22:26.560 --> 22:28.389
Call the two thou.

22:29.600 --> 22:30.861
Queen high.

22:33.600 --> 22:37.022
- Jack high. Can you beat that?
- He just did.

22:39.920 --> 22:41.385
Hello. Just a moment.

22:41.440 --> 22:43.861
- Charlie, it's your office.
- Dallas or Tulsa?

22:43.960 --> 22:45.903
Probably both.

22:47.360 --> 22:51.385
How the hell did you know I
didn't have the king or the ace?

22:51.720 --> 22:56.223
I recollect a young man putting the
same question to Eddie the Dude.

22:56.440 --> 23:00.386
"Son," Eddie told him, "all you
paid was the looking price.

23:00.480 --> 23:02.548
Lessons are extra."

23:08.400 --> 23:10.980
- Here, Lancey.
- Thank you.

23:11.320 --> 23:12.421
You gonna play the Kid?

23:12.480 --> 23:14.423
There's always a Kid, isn't there?

23:14.480 --> 23:17.902
Yes, there is. But I think
you'll enjoy his game.

23:18.000 --> 23:19.909
I may admire it...

23:20.480 --> 23:23.106
but if what I heard is true,
I doubt I'll enjoy it.

23:23.160 --> 23:27.106
Come on, the tougher the competition,
the better you used to like it.

23:27.160 --> 23:30.901
Well, what are we waiting for, Shooter?
Come on. Let's go. Deal them up.

23:43.800 --> 23:45.584
Well, I do declare, Christian.

23:45.640 --> 23:48.903
It's that three-river gambling
man, the Cincinnati Kid...

23:48.960 --> 23:51.461
getting himself all shined up.

23:52.200 --> 23:54.462
How they running, Kid?

23:54.520 --> 23:56.941
Fine. How they running for you?

23:57.000 --> 23:59.626
You'll never guess
where we've just been.

23:59.680 --> 24:01.703
Stag movies?

24:02.240 --> 24:07.551
We went to Turkish baths, and
we had rubdowns and everything.

24:07.600 --> 24:10.544
- Yeah. You should have been there.
- Yeah.

24:10.600 --> 24:12.623
Listen, I heard the big news.

24:13.040 --> 24:14.426
Big news?

24:14.480 --> 24:19.222
Yeah. Everybody says the Kid's
gonna sit down with Lancey Howard.

24:19.280 --> 24:22.429
Some say he's gonna be the man.

24:24.400 --> 24:26.901
Or didn't you know, Christian?

24:29.800 --> 24:31.664
See you around.

24:34.240 --> 24:36.820
- Double or nothing.
- Call it.

24:36.880 --> 24:38.789
Heads.

24:39.200 --> 24:41.826
You're just not ready for me yet.

24:42.080 --> 24:44.182
Come on. Let's get
something to eat.

24:53.760 --> 24:56.181
I didn't know you were
thinking about going home.

25:01.600 --> 25:03.384
When are you going?

25:11.840 --> 25:14.864
There's a bus that leaves tonight.

25:17.080 --> 25:19.786
Unless you wanted me to stay.

25:28.960 --> 25:30.710
Until morning, that is.

25:53.120 --> 25:55.222
Well, are you coming back?

25:59.480 --> 26:03.266
Well, you never even asked
me why I was going.

26:06.480 --> 26:08.708
Well, why are you going?

26:09.560 --> 26:11.389
You don't want me...

26:11.440 --> 26:15.101
around your neck. Not now, anyways.

26:17.160 --> 26:19.422
Well, I never said that.

26:32.880 --> 26:35.711
You never said anything.

26:36.960 --> 26:38.789
About us.

26:52.320 --> 26:53.785
Listen, Christian...

26:53.920 --> 26:55.943
after the game...

26:56.000 --> 26:57.989
I'll be the man.

26:59.360 --> 27:01.588
I'll be the best there is.

27:07.680 --> 27:10.590
People will sit down
at the table with you.

27:10.640 --> 27:13.903
Just so they can say they
played with the man.

27:18.240 --> 27:20.786
And that's what I'm
gonna be, Christian.

27:24.800 --> 27:26.664
I know.

27:31.680 --> 27:33.828
What is it? Marriage?

27:46.000 --> 27:48.182
I'm all packed.

28:41.800 --> 28:45.029
Six stacks. Is that right, Shooter?

28:45.560 --> 28:47.344
Six.

28:49.800 --> 28:51.504
Well...

28:51.640 --> 28:54.630
we've been playing 30 hours.

28:54.800 --> 28:58.950
That rate, 6000,
that makes roughly...

28:59.000 --> 29:01.706
two hundred dollars an hour.

29:01.840 --> 29:03.749
Thanks for the
entertainment, gentlemen.

29:03.840 --> 29:05.590
- Thank you.
- Good night.

29:06.840 --> 29:10.387
I'm particularly grateful to
Lancey here. It's been...

29:10.440 --> 29:13.942
a rewarding experience to
watch a great artist at work.

29:14.040 --> 29:15.630
Thank you for the privilege, sir.

29:15.680 --> 29:17.623
Well, you're quite welcome, son.

29:17.680 --> 29:20.943
A pleasure to meet someone who
understands that to the true gambler...

29:21.040 --> 29:27.102
money is never an end in itself but
simply a tool, as language is to thought.

29:27.520 --> 29:29.622
Good evening...

29:30.160 --> 29:32.069
Mr. Slade.

29:33.200 --> 29:35.064
Good evening, Mr. Howard.

29:41.280 --> 29:42.984
Old Shooter.

29:43.520 --> 29:46.305
I wanna see you tonight, my
house. In about 30 minutes.

29:46.840 --> 29:48.146
No, look, Slade...

29:48.200 --> 29:50.462
I can't make it tonight.
I promised my wife...

29:50.600 --> 29:53.101
You can make it, boy.
I'll see you tonight.

29:56.840 --> 29:58.908
Good evening, gentlemen.

30:13.560 --> 30:16.345
Quincy-6859, please.

30:16.400 --> 30:18.787
- Good night, Lancey.
- Night.

30:18.840 --> 30:21.022
- Night, Shooter.
- Hi, Kid. Shooter.

30:21.360 --> 30:25.465
Listen, I told Melba I'd take her
with us to the fights tonight, but...

30:26.600 --> 30:28.782
Well, something's come up.

30:28.920 --> 30:30.988
How about if she'd go
with you and Christian?

30:31.200 --> 30:34.270
Christian isn't here. She's with
her folks for a couple of days.

30:34.320 --> 30:36.468
Did Lancey go for
it as a game setup?

30:38.240 --> 30:40.547
Yeah. Just about.

30:40.680 --> 30:43.181
Is it okay if Melba goes with you?

30:43.560 --> 30:47.346
- Look, Shooter...
- I promised her. You know how it is.

30:49.040 --> 30:51.029
Well, I'd appreciate it.

30:51.520 --> 30:53.031
Thanks, Kid.

30:53.120 --> 30:55.826
I'll meet you at my
place after the fight.

30:59.400 --> 31:01.548
Well, Lancey, are we all
set for Monday night?

31:01.680 --> 31:04.386
- Mm-hmm.
- I can get Lady Fingers to come.

31:04.440 --> 31:06.542
- Lady Fingers?
- Mm-hmm.

31:06.680 --> 31:09.545
I haven't seen that old bitch...

31:09.680 --> 31:12.545
Oh, it must be at least 10 years.

31:12.640 --> 31:15.220
Long enough to think
of her almost fondly.

31:15.280 --> 31:17.462
- How's she doing?
- She's down.

31:17.560 --> 31:19.901
She busted out in a
Vegas faro game.

31:19.960 --> 31:21.744
And...

31:21.800 --> 31:25.143
I'd like to use her as a relief
dealer, if that's okay with you.

31:25.200 --> 31:27.746
- Oh, sure. Sure.
- Well, I guess that's it, then, huh?

31:27.800 --> 31:29.186
Eight o'clock Monday.

31:29.280 --> 31:31.223
Apartment 2A at the old Lafayette.

31:31.320 --> 31:35.186
- Yes.
- And may the best man win.

31:35.240 --> 31:37.820
That's how it usually comes
out in the long run.

31:37.920 --> 31:39.510
Oh, Shooter...

31:39.560 --> 31:41.105
tell me...

31:41.160 --> 31:44.582
is this young man of yours
gonna give me any trouble?

31:46.080 --> 31:48.023
Yeah. He's gonna give you trouble.

31:48.080 --> 31:51.423
Well, I hope it isn't gonna be
one of those marathon games.

31:51.480 --> 31:54.265
- Not anymore.
- Like the session we had in St. Louis?

31:54.320 --> 31:55.910
- Remember?
- Sure, sure.

31:55.960 --> 31:58.381
With those hoods
from South Chicago?

31:58.440 --> 32:02.625
The longest game I ever played was on
the maiden voyage of the Mauretania.

32:02.680 --> 32:04.942
Bishop's Rock to Ambrose
Light without a stop.

32:05.000 --> 32:06.431
Six days.

32:06.480 --> 32:08.105
Lancey...

32:08.640 --> 32:12.301
you have been the
man for a long time.

32:12.760 --> 32:15.943
That is undoubtedly true.

32:16.520 --> 32:18.304
But don't let that fool you.

32:19.840 --> 32:22.784
I'm not ready to retire yet.

32:24.040 --> 32:25.630
Thank you.

32:31.120 --> 32:33.871
- Hello, Kid. How are you?
- Hey, Al.

32:33.920 --> 32:35.749
- How many you want?
- One.

32:35.800 --> 32:38.949
- One.
- Hey, Kid.

32:46.480 --> 32:48.423
Hi. How many rounds?

32:48.480 --> 32:50.582
Hey, kids.

32:53.560 --> 32:54.946
Hey, Kid.

32:55.360 --> 32:57.144
Over here!

32:57.280 --> 32:58.666
I got two seats for you...

32:58.760 --> 33:00.624
Do we have to sit with them?

33:00.680 --> 33:02.669
Sit where you want to.

33:03.200 --> 33:05.826
Come on, Jessie, move over.

33:05.920 --> 33:09.149
Come on there, boy. Hey, hey.

33:09.200 --> 33:11.029
- Hello, Hoban.
- Where's the Shooter?

33:11.080 --> 33:12.944
Working.

33:13.840 --> 33:15.669
Sokal.

33:16.040 --> 33:18.586
- Hello, Jessie.
- Where's Christian, honey?

33:19.000 --> 33:21.023
She went home to mama.

33:21.080 --> 33:23.023
Didn't She, Kid?

33:24.920 --> 33:27.546
Can't live with them and can't
live without them, huh?

33:27.760 --> 33:29.146
Yeah, that's right, Pig.

33:29.360 --> 33:32.543
Don't lose no sweat,
Kid. Mine left me too.

33:33.080 --> 33:34.784
I wonder why.

33:35.920 --> 33:37.988
Who you trying to kid, sister?

33:47.960 --> 33:52.224
Sonnet Gray and Gaffer's Gray!

33:55.280 --> 33:59.544
Sonnet Gray and Gaffer's Gray!

34:03.440 --> 34:07.750
Sonnet Gray and Gaffer's Gray!

34:10.639 --> 34:12.902
- Twenty-five and 20!
- Which one?

34:12.960 --> 34:15.027
- Sonnet Gray.
- All right.

34:37.560 --> 34:40.106
All right. Get them up.

34:41.159 --> 34:43.024
Get ready.

35:15.680 --> 35:17.305
Come on!

35:37.480 --> 35:40.151
Let's go out to the car.

35:40.720 --> 35:42.151
Why don't you relax.

35:43.560 --> 35:45.662
- You say 25 and 20?
- That's right.

35:45.720 --> 35:48.346
- To lose.
- He's got him. He's got him.

35:59.440 --> 36:02.271
Looks like you're gonna owe
us some money, fat boy.

36:02.320 --> 36:04.502
Don't spend it, baby.
Don't spend it!

36:07.080 --> 36:11.344
Alice Lee, honey, would you like to freshen
up Mr. William's drink a little bit?

36:11.480 --> 36:14.948
- A little more bourbon, Mr. William?
- Thank you, Mrs. Slade.

36:16.080 --> 36:18.547
Now, you just say when.

36:18.600 --> 36:22.147
When. That's it. Thank
you kindly, Mrs. Slade.

36:22.240 --> 36:26.026
Honey, why don't you go out to the
kitchen and bring us some of those...

36:26.120 --> 36:28.700
fancy little hors d'oeuvres.

36:28.760 --> 36:31.545
Why, that's exactly what I
was about to do, sugar.

36:31.600 --> 36:36.706
I declare, Billy, sometimes I
think you got psychic powers.

36:39.600 --> 36:42.067
She's a real lady, Mrs. Slade.

36:42.120 --> 36:47.750
That little gal means more to me
than the whole wide world, Shooter.

36:49.280 --> 36:51.906
How's your Melba these days?

36:51.960 --> 36:56.145
Melba? Well, she's fine. Just fine.

36:59.440 --> 37:02.225
Yeah, she's a nice girl, Melba.

37:02.320 --> 37:05.264
Girl of quality and taste.

37:05.320 --> 37:08.071
Expensive tastes, I would imagine.

37:08.160 --> 37:11.901
- Well, I guess you might say that, yes.
- Well, that's as it should be.

37:12.000 --> 37:16.503
That's one of the great
feminine characteristics.

37:16.560 --> 37:18.549
Taste for fine things.

37:18.600 --> 37:21.749
Of course, we can't always
afford to indulge their tastes.

37:21.840 --> 37:24.261
That's the tragedy of it.

37:27.080 --> 37:30.423
That's when they
start to drift away.

37:38.680 --> 37:45.186
You know this game that you're dealing
for Lancey and the Kid, you know?

37:45.280 --> 37:50.420
There's an awful lot of interest
developing in that game.

37:52.360 --> 37:55.191
Betting interest, that is.

37:56.800 --> 37:59.471
What would you figure the
odds to be, Shooter?

37:59.560 --> 38:02.948
Well, I'd say the New York money
will probably lay about...

38:03.000 --> 38:05.831
oh, 8-5 on Lancey.

38:05.880 --> 38:08.460
Personally, I think the
Kid's chances are better.

38:08.520 --> 38:12.102
So do I. So do I. That's why
I'm getting me down a bet.

38:12.160 --> 38:15.264
- Big bet.
- Well, I don't think I'd wanna bet on it.

38:15.320 --> 38:19.664
The Kid could take him, if he's
right, but I'd never bet on it.

38:19.720 --> 38:24.621
Lancey Howard is an old man,
Shooter. He's ready for a fall.

38:24.680 --> 38:28.307
Trouble is that the Kid might
be nervous, big game like this.

38:28.360 --> 38:31.828
He may be off his form.
He may need a little help.

38:31.880 --> 38:33.345
You know?

38:34.840 --> 38:37.420
No, I don't. I don't quite
know what you mean.

38:37.480 --> 38:39.821
- You're dealing the game, aren't you?
- Yes.

38:39.920 --> 38:44.264
As long as I'm going to the trouble
of putting a bet down for myself...

38:44.320 --> 38:50.268
I may as well get one for you too.
Say in the neighborhood of $25,000?

38:51.920 --> 38:54.990
I could never do
anything like that.

38:55.040 --> 38:58.622
Of course you couldn't. That's why they
chose you to give them a fair deal.

38:58.680 --> 39:01.784
It's out of the question,
Mr. Slade. You see...

39:01.840 --> 39:03.704
If I...

39:04.360 --> 39:08.181
- I tell you, it's just out of the question.
- <i>Merci</i>, Emile.

39:08.280 --> 39:11.111
Well, the Kid's not gonna
need much help, Shooter.

39:11.200 --> 39:15.225
Maybe two or three hands
at the right time.

39:16.280 --> 39:20.704
Oh, Melba would be mighty proud of
you if you won yourself $25,000.

39:20.760 --> 39:23.227
No, I'm sorry, Mr. Slade.

39:24.600 --> 39:28.386
Well, I'm sorry too, Shooter, because
you leave me no alternative...

39:28.440 --> 39:33.387
but to remind you of the fact that
I'm carrying these markers on you.

39:33.440 --> 39:37.181
- Twelve thousand dollars, to be exact.
- Those are legitimate markers.

39:37.240 --> 39:40.583
- You gave me two years to pay them.
- Now, wait a minute.

39:40.640 --> 39:44.745
Just because I'm generous or foolish
enough to accept your marker one day...

39:44.800 --> 39:48.063
doesn't mean I'm gonna recognize
it the next. No, sir, no.

39:48.160 --> 39:51.901
That recognition is null and void
if I happen to suddenly realize...

39:51.960 --> 39:55.303
that you are not of sound mind.

39:57.760 --> 40:00.545
You know when I realized that?

40:02.320 --> 40:06.789
When I saw you hesitate about
accepting that $25,000.

40:20.000 --> 40:23.547
That's right, boy.
You just think that over.

40:24.960 --> 40:28.906
Twenty-five thousand,
plus 12,000 here.

40:28.960 --> 40:31.267
- That makes...
- Thirty-seven.

40:31.680 --> 40:35.307
Thirty-seven, if memory serves.

40:39.120 --> 40:41.871
Why are you doing this?
It can't be for money.

40:41.960 --> 40:45.621
It's for my kind of money.
Gut money.

40:46.280 --> 40:50.146
I wanna see that smug
old bastard gutted.

40:50.200 --> 40:51.904
- Gutted.
- Like he gutted you?

40:51.960 --> 40:54.950
- Yes, that's right. That's right. Hold it.
- I'm gonna be...

40:55.000 --> 40:57.990
Lookie here, Cora-Anne
and Billy-Bob...

40:58.040 --> 41:00.461
come to say good night
to their daddy.

41:00.560 --> 41:03.982
Well, now, my cottontail
bunny rabbits. Come here.

41:04.040 --> 41:06.984
- Holler if you need anything, now.
- All right.

41:07.040 --> 41:09.507
Do you wanna hear a
little bedtime story?

41:09.560 --> 41:11.947
About Shooter's wife, Melba?

41:13.400 --> 41:17.949
- All right, now...
- I know all those stories.

41:18.000 --> 41:22.503
Well, are you aware of the circumstances
on which she left Shreveport, Louisiana?

41:22.560 --> 41:24.185
Yes, I'm aware.

41:24.240 --> 41:28.106
Well, some people don't know the story.
I think they'd enjoy hearing it.

41:28.160 --> 41:31.343
It's a story that
deserves to be told.

41:31.400 --> 41:34.185
Now, listen carefully, children.

41:34.280 --> 41:36.860
Once upon a time...

41:36.920 --> 41:40.866
down in Shreveport, Louisiana...

41:40.920 --> 41:44.820
there was this bad little
girl named Melba Nyle.

41:59.440 --> 42:02.020
Relax. Shooter will be along.

42:02.120 --> 42:05.542
Why don't you make us a
drink. You know where it is.

42:16.320 --> 42:22.382
All that dust at the pit. I always feel
so dirty after one of those things.

42:22.440 --> 42:25.464
Brings out the best in you, Melba.

42:26.200 --> 42:30.350
What does that funny little
country gal bring out in you?

43:03.680 --> 43:05.509
See anything you like?

43:05.600 --> 43:07.941
About the dance, I mean.

43:08.000 --> 43:12.105
Now, don't tell me Shooter's
your oldest and best friend.

43:12.160 --> 43:15.264
- That's right.
- He's mine too, honey.

43:15.360 --> 43:19.101
Next you're gonna say
he's like a father to you.

43:19.200 --> 43:21.382
You see what that leaves us.

43:21.440 --> 43:23.463
Yeah.

43:35.200 --> 43:37.951
Yeah? Oh, hi, sugar.

43:39.320 --> 43:42.469
Well, then you won't
be home for a while.

43:42.520 --> 43:43.985
Yeah?

43:44.040 --> 43:46.984
Shooter. Yeah. Ls the game set?

43:47.520 --> 43:50.590
Eight o'clock Monday, apartment
2A at the old Lafayette.

43:51.360 --> 43:52.985
Old Lafayette.

43:53.040 --> 43:56.303
Yeah. Yeah.

43:58.560 --> 44:01.311
Yeah, she seemed to have
a pretty good time.

44:01.880 --> 44:04.460
Yeah, she's a fun girl.

44:06.440 --> 44:08.030
Yeah.

44:36.760 --> 44:38.464
You bastard!

44:41.280 --> 44:43.542
I hope you lose.

44:45.960 --> 44:47.869
Thanks, baby.

44:53.920 --> 44:57.706
Day after tomorrow at the
old Hotel Lafayette, 8:00.

44:57.880 --> 45:01.905
Yeah, you better let him know. They
gonna be full up, from what I hear.

45:01.960 --> 45:05.348
Same to you. You know who that
was, Kid? Jollie from Boston...

45:05.400 --> 45:07.070
- You seen Shooter?
- No, not today.

45:07.120 --> 45:10.986
Called all the way from Boston. And Lady
Fingers. Guess you know she's coming.

45:11.040 --> 45:14.587
And Yeller. There's gonna
be a lot of money in town.

45:14.640 --> 45:17.391
Hey, how's it going?
Hoban tell you about Yeller?

45:17.480 --> 45:19.867
Yeah, I was just telling him.

45:20.640 --> 45:23.061
I'll see you later.

45:23.120 --> 45:24.665
Hey, Kid.

45:25.800 --> 45:27.140
Hey, what's wrong?

45:27.240 --> 45:29.422
Jack Doyle's laying 12-5 on Lancey.

45:29.520 --> 45:31.748
Jack Doyle. Now, listen,
that's old money.

45:31.800 --> 45:34.506
Conservative money.
That's always on the man.

45:34.560 --> 45:37.345
- There's plenty of money on you too.
- It's the waiting.

45:37.400 --> 45:39.264
I'm ready now, and I gotta wait.

45:39.320 --> 45:42.583
Don't let the odds rattle you.
That's the worst that can happen.

45:42.640 --> 45:45.425
- Stay loose. Relax.
- It's not the odds. I told you.

45:45.480 --> 45:47.548
- It's the wait.
- Listen, just relax.

45:47.640 --> 45:49.947
I'll see you later, Shooter.

45:53.080 --> 45:54.784
Hey, Kid!

46:11.680 --> 46:13.430
Hi, honey.

49:09.640 --> 49:12.107
- Hi, Kid.
- Hi.

49:12.360 --> 49:14.827
This is a surprise.

49:14.880 --> 49:16.948
- Did you come on the bus?
- Well, yeah.

49:17.000 --> 49:20.661
I just came by to see
how you were doing.

49:22.880 --> 49:25.221
Mama, this is Eric.

49:25.280 --> 49:27.223
How do you do, Mrs. Rudd?

49:27.280 --> 49:29.144
Howdy.

49:31.280 --> 49:33.986
Why don't you sit down,
and I'll fix you something.

49:34.040 --> 49:36.063
No, I had something to eat in town.

49:36.160 --> 49:38.262
Come on.

49:59.400 --> 50:02.868
There's some hot
biscuits in the warmer.

50:20.120 --> 50:21.870
Come on.

50:51.920 --> 50:55.229
I used to come here and
play when I was little.

50:55.360 --> 50:57.747
I'd dream, mostly.

50:59.080 --> 51:01.865
Yeah? About what?

51:01.920 --> 51:07.550
Oh, just things that
little girls dream about.

51:24.000 --> 51:28.025
There was a story I heard...

51:28.080 --> 51:32.344
about a wishing stone somewhere
on the bank of the Mississippi.

51:33.280 --> 51:38.625
And I used to play like this
creek was the Mississippi...

51:38.680 --> 51:42.466
and that rock over there
was a wishing stone.

51:43.200 --> 51:46.622
And if I kissed it...

51:46.680 --> 51:49.386
and made a wish...

51:49.440 --> 51:51.269
it'd come true.

51:51.320 --> 51:53.866
What was the wish?

51:54.960 --> 51:58.462
Oh, that somebody would come
and take me away from here...

51:58.520 --> 52:03.626
to some big city
like New Orleans...

52:03.720 --> 52:06.391
or Mobile.

52:31.080 --> 52:33.342
Sure was a good dinner, Mrs. Rudd.

52:33.440 --> 52:35.747
Just our usual.

52:36.400 --> 52:39.663
Christian, help your
mother with the dishes.

52:39.760 --> 52:42.511
- Ma, we got any cards?
- Cards?

52:42.560 --> 52:45.345
You know, them playing cards.
We used to have some.

52:45.400 --> 52:47.867
May still be some in
that drawer over there.

52:47.960 --> 52:50.711
I don't know how good they are.

52:55.600 --> 52:58.465
Now you can show Papa
some of them tricks.

52:58.520 --> 52:59.860
- Tricks?
- Yeah.

52:59.920 --> 53:02.626
Like you done with that
little shoeshine boy.

53:03.480 --> 53:09.701
- I best get on with my evening chores.
- Oh, please, Papa. You'll like it.

53:27.520 --> 53:29.987
Pick a card, Mr. Rudd.

53:36.640 --> 53:39.107
Any card you want.

53:43.320 --> 53:45.388
Three of hearts.

53:48.120 --> 53:50.587
Damnedest thing I ever did see.

53:52.120 --> 53:54.905
Hey, you gotta come in and
see this one. Get in here.

53:55.040 --> 53:57.347
- Come on, Mama.
- This is the best yet.

53:57.400 --> 54:00.947
- Come on in here.
- You got any idea what time it is?

54:01.000 --> 54:03.262
Come on. Get over
here, get over here.

54:03.320 --> 54:05.582
Come on, Mama.

54:05.640 --> 54:09.222
Come on. I want you to see this.
Now, you look good.

54:09.280 --> 54:11.587
- Show her, Eric.
- All right, Mrs. Rudd.

54:11.680 --> 54:15.262
Now, just take a card.
Any card at all.

54:18.160 --> 54:20.262
Don't show it to me.

54:21.480 --> 54:23.787
The three of spades.

55:00.560 --> 55:04.267
Are you playing tonight
or just dealing?

55:09.240 --> 55:12.822
- Are you playing tonight?
- Yes, I'm playing tonight. I'm playing.

55:12.880 --> 55:15.506
- How much you gonna win?
- I'll win something.

55:15.560 --> 55:18.186
Don't you worry about it.

55:19.080 --> 55:24.027
Twenty-five years. I've been
building a reputation for 25 years.

55:24.080 --> 55:26.751
- My honesty, integrity...
- Remember what you said...

55:26.840 --> 55:30.023
- ...about cheating yourself?
- What are you talking about?

55:30.080 --> 55:33.309
You know what I'm talking about.

55:36.680 --> 55:39.101
Well, I'll tell you one thing.

55:39.640 --> 55:43.506
I'm not gonna give him any
help unless he needs it.

55:44.080 --> 55:47.024
Good old honest Shooter.

55:47.120 --> 55:51.145
You know, you remind me more
and more of my first husband.

55:51.640 --> 55:55.540
- He was a loser too.
- Well, I'm no loser.

55:55.600 --> 55:59.386
The Kid could break lucky and stay
ahead the whole game, couldn't he?

55:59.440 --> 56:01.702
Well, it could happen, couldn't it?

56:01.760 --> 56:04.067
Sure it could happen.

56:04.640 --> 56:08.790
I mean, be there to
see that it does.

56:08.880 --> 56:11.221
Won't you, Shooter?

58:16.040 --> 58:18.666
<i>Take me around the block
a couple of times.</i>

58:20.080 --> 58:23.468
You did tell the Kid
8:00, didn't you?

58:23.560 --> 58:24.991
Yes, I did.

58:25.040 --> 58:26.346
Well?

58:26.440 --> 58:28.030
Hello, everybody.

58:28.440 --> 58:30.986
- Lady!
- Piggy, Pig, Pig.

58:31.040 --> 58:33.381
Doctor. Oh, how lovely.

58:33.440 --> 58:35.702
- Lady Fingers.
- Yeller! Good to see you.

58:35.760 --> 58:37.021
- Hiya.
- Hi, Ho.

58:37.080 --> 58:39.262
Lady Fingers. You know the missus.

58:39.320 --> 58:42.663
- Hello there.
- Mrs. Hoban. Melba.

58:42.720 --> 58:45.027
- Sorry I'm late, Shooter.
- Lady!

58:45.120 --> 58:47.382
What do you say, sweetheart?

58:48.440 --> 58:52.067
Lancey Howard. The man himself.

58:52.120 --> 58:54.063
My pleasure, Lady Fingers.

58:54.120 --> 58:56.666
You don't get around these
parts much anymore.

58:56.760 --> 59:00.546
That's true. I suppose it's more a
matter of climate than anything else.

59:00.640 --> 59:02.344
No other reason?

59:02.400 --> 59:05.390
- What other reason could there be?
- The Cincinnati Kid.

59:05.600 --> 59:10.069
That's what they're saying, Lancey.
You've been scared of the Kid.

59:10.120 --> 59:11.585
Should I be?

59:11.640 --> 59:14.584
Hey, Kid. He's here.

59:15.080 --> 59:17.069
Damn right.

59:22.200 --> 59:24.507
- Steve.
- Go.

59:24.960 --> 59:26.824
Oh, that sounds wonderful.

59:26.880 --> 59:30.268
Hey, you come up
slashing, you hear?

59:36.080 --> 59:38.228
Hello, Yeller.

59:38.640 --> 59:41.186
Kill that cat, Kid.

59:41.240 --> 59:43.388
Hello, Kid. How are you feeling?

59:43.440 --> 59:44.587
Well, I'm feeling great.

59:44.680 --> 59:48.341
- And it's good to see you again.
- Play him close.

59:55.160 --> 59:57.069
Well...

59:57.520 --> 01:00:00.863
- ...let's get started.
- Yeah. Absolutely.

01:00:00.920 --> 01:00:02.943
Lancey...

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:05.421
this is Eric Stoner,
the Cincinnati Kid.

01:00:05.480 --> 01:00:07.628
Lancey Howard.

01:00:09.040 --> 01:00:11.586
I'm glad to know you, Lancey.

01:00:13.120 --> 01:00:14.631
My pleasure.

01:00:14.680 --> 01:00:16.145
How the town treating you?

01:00:16.360 --> 01:00:18.986
New Orleans always been good to me.

01:00:21.200 --> 01:00:25.828
Well, that's fine. Of course, towns
do change, though, don't they?

01:00:28.560 --> 01:00:32.460
They tell me you're quite
a stud player, young man.

01:00:32.560 --> 01:00:34.981
- Do they?
- That's right.

01:00:35.040 --> 01:00:37.825
New York, Chicago, Miami.

01:00:37.880 --> 01:00:41.826
Oh, I've been hearing about you
for a couple of years now.

01:00:41.920 --> 01:00:46.469
Yeller there tells me how you gutted
him once with a pair of fours.

01:00:46.880 --> 01:00:49.347
That's right. Remember, Kid?

01:00:49.400 --> 01:00:52.185
The night you cut me up
with the two red fours?

01:00:52.240 --> 01:00:55.503
Must have overplayed my hand.

01:00:57.560 --> 01:01:00.869
Well, that's a
dangerous thing to do.

01:01:00.920 --> 01:01:04.183
Well, it depends who you're
sitting with, Lancey.

01:01:08.880 --> 01:01:11.028
- Well, let's play some cards.
- Hoban?

01:01:11.080 --> 01:01:13.467
- Yeah.
- I've already looked around...

01:01:13.560 --> 01:01:17.551
- ...so if you wanna have a look...
- Thanks, Lancey, I think I will.

01:01:45.360 --> 01:01:48.350
They come from the New
Orleans Bridge Club...

01:01:48.400 --> 01:01:50.707
and they've been
bonded by the steward.

01:01:50.760 --> 01:01:53.227
I seen him take them right
out of the safe himself.

01:01:53.280 --> 01:01:59.069
And Shooter, Lady Fingers and me
just carried them right here.

01:02:00.120 --> 01:02:04.066
Hoban's selling them to us at $5
a pack with the usual guarantee.

01:02:04.120 --> 01:02:07.144
If it's proved a deck's been
juiced, he pays off the losers.

01:02:07.240 --> 01:02:09.422
- Who's sitting with us?
- The four of us.

01:02:09.480 --> 01:02:11.184
Me, Pig, Yeller and Doc Sokal.

01:02:11.240 --> 01:02:13.707
- If that's all right with the both of you?
- Fine.

01:02:13.760 --> 01:02:15.510
Sure, sure.

01:02:15.760 --> 01:02:18.261
- Dead.
- Dead.

01:02:25.320 --> 01:02:28.230
Now, Kid, what's your game?

01:02:28.280 --> 01:02:29.870
Stud poker.

01:02:35.800 --> 01:02:37.550
Gentlemen...

01:02:37.600 --> 01:02:40.544
if there are no objections,
I'm the dealer.

01:02:40.600 --> 01:02:41.940
All right.

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:46.788
These rooms have been contracted for,
the ante will be $10 per chair per day.

01:02:50.440 --> 01:02:53.749
During the breaks for me, Lady
Fingers has agreed to deal.

01:02:53.800 --> 01:02:55.743
But she don't care to be a player.

01:02:55.800 --> 01:02:57.948
I'm sorry to hear
that, Lady Fingers.

01:02:58.040 --> 01:03:01.144
You know how much I enjoy
your high style of playing.

01:03:01.200 --> 01:03:04.144
You got a lot of style
yourself, Lancey.

01:03:04.200 --> 01:03:05.665
Thank you.

01:03:06.360 --> 01:03:08.827
Let's hope it holds out.

01:03:12.680 --> 01:03:17.149
Gentlemen, this game is
five-card stud poker.

01:03:18.280 --> 01:03:21.623
There's no limit. No string bets.

01:03:22.040 --> 01:03:24.507
You can check and raise.

01:03:24.600 --> 01:03:30.104
A dead man has one half-hour to raise his
roll outside and get back in the game.

01:04:10.280 --> 01:04:15.864
Ace, seven, nine, nine, trey.

01:04:15.920 --> 01:04:18.830
Dealer guns up a 10. Ace bets.

01:04:19.440 --> 01:04:21.702
- Ten dollars.
- Call the sawbuck.

01:04:21.760 --> 01:04:23.021
- I'll play.
- I'm in.

01:04:23.080 --> 01:04:25.467
- Off and running.
- Dealer folds.

01:04:25.520 --> 01:04:28.146
Eight to the ace.
King to the seven.

01:04:28.200 --> 01:04:30.348
Queen to the nine. Pair of nines.

01:04:30.400 --> 01:04:32.662
Deuce. Pair of nines bets.

01:04:32.760 --> 01:04:35.386
- Double sawbuck.
- I don't chase the nines.

01:04:35.440 --> 01:04:37.542
Hold.

01:04:37.960 --> 01:04:40.062
I fold.

01:04:53.440 --> 01:04:59.070
Queen, four, 10, king, king...

01:04:59.160 --> 01:05:01.262
and an ace to the man.

01:05:01.480 --> 01:05:04.106
Ace bets $25.

01:05:06.480 --> 01:05:08.901
And I can't get started.

01:05:11.080 --> 01:05:13.069
Call.

01:05:13.120 --> 01:05:15.109
Keep dealing.

01:05:15.160 --> 01:05:16.421
King folds.

01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:20.263
Did you see that?
Shooter folded a king.

01:05:20.320 --> 01:05:22.787
Shooter knows what he's doing.

01:05:22.840 --> 01:05:25.944
He's a percentage player.
That right, Melba?

01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:28.262
That's what they say, Mr. Slade.

01:05:28.360 --> 01:05:32.067
Well, he'd better be if he's
gonna remain anything at all.

01:05:32.360 --> 01:05:34.622
- Ten's bet.
- Hundred.

01:05:35.280 --> 01:05:37.109
Came here to play.

01:05:37.200 --> 01:05:39.302
- I'm in.
- Fold.

01:05:40.960 --> 01:05:43.301
Queen to the 10s. Ten.

01:05:43.360 --> 01:05:45.144
- Pair of fives.
- Two and a half.

01:05:45.200 --> 01:05:47.428
- How much?
- Two-fifty.

01:05:49.640 --> 01:05:52.789
Make it 500 and see you both run.

01:05:58.680 --> 01:06:00.305
Your 5...

01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:04.341
- ...and up 2.
- Another 200.

01:06:04.720 --> 01:06:06.822
Thousand.

01:06:07.040 --> 01:06:09.063
Two thou...?

01:06:09.560 --> 01:06:11.662
Hey, Lancey's out
for the quick kill.

01:06:11.720 --> 01:06:14.664
My bet. Your 2000. Three more.

01:06:14.720 --> 01:06:18.461
- I'm 2000 light.
- No, you're not.

01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:35.670
I'll try it.

01:06:35.760 --> 01:06:38.022
Five thousand to you, Pig.

01:06:39.080 --> 01:06:41.342
Well, that's pretty sweet.

01:06:41.400 --> 01:06:43.980
I jack it up and get
whipped on both sides.

01:06:48.320 --> 01:06:49.990
Lancey?

01:06:58.760 --> 01:07:00.669
New deck, please.

01:07:00.720 --> 01:07:02.788
He don't chase the Kid nowhere.

01:07:25.440 --> 01:07:27.065
Read them and weep, boys.

01:07:27.120 --> 01:07:28.585
Aces up.

01:07:28.640 --> 01:07:31.186
Thank you, gentlemen.

01:07:33.400 --> 01:07:36.424
Be funny if the two champs
got cleaned up, huh, Yeller?

01:07:36.480 --> 01:07:39.902
Yeah, man. Absolutely hilarious.

01:07:40.440 --> 01:07:43.749
- What's the action?
- Pig's ahead about a grand...

01:07:43.800 --> 01:07:45.743
the Kid maybe 1200.

01:07:45.800 --> 01:07:47.982
- Yeller's up.
- Lancey?

01:07:48.080 --> 01:07:51.263
Well, the Kid hit him once,
and he ain't come back yet.

01:07:51.360 --> 01:07:53.986
- He'll take out Pig first.
- King bets.

01:07:54.360 --> 01:07:56.940
This king and my natural rhythm...

01:07:57.000 --> 01:07:58.864
says $20.

01:07:58.920 --> 01:08:00.260
Pass.

01:08:00.320 --> 01:08:01.910
- In for 20.
- Fold.

01:08:01.960 --> 01:08:04.267
- I'm in.
- In.

01:08:05.160 --> 01:08:07.024
Pair of jacks.

01:08:07.960 --> 01:08:09.425
Ten.

01:08:10.520 --> 01:08:12.509
Jack to the king.

01:08:12.760 --> 01:08:15.181
Seven to the queen.
Pair of jacks bets.

01:08:20.279 --> 01:08:23.111
Pair of jacks will venture $100.

01:08:27.680 --> 01:08:29.464
Also.

01:08:32.200 --> 01:08:33.790
Man, I'm outside.

01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:42.988
I'll up it 200.

01:08:43.040 --> 01:08:45.301
Lancey could be laying for
him with three jacks.

01:08:45.359 --> 01:08:47.827
- I'll see the 200.
- Pig don't think so.

01:08:48.960 --> 01:08:50.630
I'm sticking.

01:08:52.200 --> 01:08:53.984
Ten to the jacks.

01:08:54.040 --> 01:08:56.029
Possible straight.

01:08:56.399 --> 01:08:58.149
Pair of sevens.

01:08:58.960 --> 01:09:00.505
Check those sevens.

01:09:00.560 --> 01:09:02.149
Likewise.

01:09:04.560 --> 01:09:06.344
I'll...

01:09:06.840 --> 01:09:08.669
bet the size of the pot.

01:09:10.080 --> 01:09:11.988
Nine hundred and...

01:09:12.080 --> 01:09:14.103
Nine hundred and eighty.

01:09:17.840 --> 01:09:20.102
Call the 980.

01:09:20.920 --> 01:09:22.180
Doc...

01:09:26.439 --> 01:09:28.029
I'll play.

01:09:32.240 --> 01:09:34.468
Trey to the jacks.

01:09:35.240 --> 01:09:36.580
Busted.

01:09:36.920 --> 01:09:38.863
No straight, no flush.

01:09:39.600 --> 01:09:41.304
Nine to the sevens.

01:09:41.399 --> 01:09:42.706
Jacks bet.

01:09:42.760 --> 01:09:44.385
Check.

01:09:49.359 --> 01:09:50.871
Pair of sevens says...

01:09:54.480 --> 01:09:57.629
Pair of sevens says 1500 bucks.

01:10:07.960 --> 01:10:11.064
I'll call your 1500
and raise you...

01:10:17.480 --> 01:10:18.991
2500.

01:10:27.400 --> 01:10:29.423
Twenty-five to you, Pig.

01:10:33.480 --> 01:10:35.264
I haven't got it.

01:10:35.480 --> 01:10:37.548
How much have you got?

01:10:44.320 --> 01:10:45.910
Eleven hundred.

01:10:47.160 --> 01:10:50.264
All right. Then we'll make it 1100.

01:10:53.680 --> 01:10:55.270
Five...

01:10:56.120 --> 01:10:59.383
10, 14.

01:11:07.840 --> 01:11:09.624
Eleven hundred to you, Pig.

01:11:16.760 --> 01:11:19.784
No. I won't call.

01:11:24.680 --> 01:11:26.464
Take it easy, Pig.

01:11:28.520 --> 01:11:30.543
Deal me out.

01:11:37.280 --> 01:11:39.667
You let him fake you out.

01:11:44.400 --> 01:11:45.831
Thanks, Lancey.

01:11:47.680 --> 01:11:49.669
Thanks a lot.

01:11:51.640 --> 01:11:54.107
Not very lucky, is he?

01:11:56.360 --> 01:11:58.428
He never has been.

01:12:06.720 --> 01:12:08.185
Look, I...

01:12:08.240 --> 01:12:11.344
know it's a little early. What
do you say we take a break?

01:12:11.400 --> 01:12:13.787
Yeah, let's go a little while.

01:12:15.160 --> 01:12:17.342
Thank you kindly, Melba.

01:12:17.400 --> 01:12:19.025
Thank you, dear.

01:12:20.120 --> 01:12:24.703
You know, Melba, it always distresses
me, a man like Shooter here...

01:12:24.760 --> 01:12:27.943
reaching his middle years and
still having no assurance...

01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:29.625
of next week's income.

01:12:29.680 --> 01:12:33.705
- I know what you mean, Mr. Slade.
- Don't you find that kind of disturbing?

01:12:33.760 --> 01:12:36.545
- Mm-hmm.
- Excuse me.

01:12:36.760 --> 01:12:40.546
- Say, Hoban...
- And Spider Man died kind of slow.

01:12:40.600 --> 01:12:42.862
First they took a kidney,
then a gallbladder...

01:12:42.960 --> 01:12:45.461
and then they took his
whole damn stomach.

01:12:45.520 --> 01:12:47.509
You remember Spider Man, don't you?

01:12:47.560 --> 01:12:49.901
- Who?
- Spider Man. He was about your age.

01:12:49.960 --> 01:12:51.550
- Yes, yes.
- Lady Fingers.

01:12:51.640 --> 01:12:54.630
- Will you please help me with the food?
- He died kind of slow.

01:12:55.200 --> 01:12:58.065
Yeah, man, why don't you
come on up to Memphis.

01:12:58.120 --> 01:13:00.905
- Things are hot up there.
- Wait. I'll go with you.

01:13:00.960 --> 01:13:02.585
Solid.

01:13:14.160 --> 01:13:16.911
- Good crowd.
- Yeah.

01:13:18.800 --> 01:13:20.584
You know, Kid...

01:13:20.640 --> 01:13:25.701
you're the best stud-poker player
I've seen in 35 years of action.

01:13:26.800 --> 01:13:28.823
Thank you, Lancey.

01:13:29.120 --> 01:13:33.509
You know, that was a sweet thing
you did to the Pig with those jacks.

01:13:34.280 --> 01:13:36.030
You saw that coming, did you?

01:13:36.080 --> 01:13:37.864
Yeah, I saw it coming.

01:13:37.920 --> 01:13:39.943
Before I raised?

01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:42.307
I saw it coming, Lancey.

01:13:44.200 --> 01:13:46.951
You ever play down Miami?

01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:48.943
- Not yet.
- Beautiful town.

01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:51.865
Lot of loose money around. You
ought to come down sometime.

01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:54.580
- I might do that.
- Gotta have good nerves, though.

01:13:54.640 --> 01:13:57.949
You lose the feel of the cards
when you have so much action...

01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:02.071
day in and day out. Unless
your nerves can hold.

01:14:02.680 --> 01:14:04.145
How are yours, Kid?

01:14:04.240 --> 01:14:06.308
They've been worse.

01:14:08.360 --> 01:14:12.465
I'm not keeping you
from anyone, am I?

01:14:12.680 --> 01:14:14.066
No.

01:14:14.120 --> 01:14:17.144
- Girl, maybe?
- No. No.

01:14:17.640 --> 01:14:19.310
Well, don't you have a girl?

01:14:21.040 --> 01:14:23.666
Yeah, well, she's out
of town right now.

01:14:25.040 --> 01:14:27.666
No unpleasantness, I hope.

01:14:30.520 --> 01:14:32.304
Well...

01:14:33.400 --> 01:14:36.583
women are a universal
problem in our business.

01:14:36.640 --> 01:14:41.462
Of course, it's purely an
academic question with me now...

01:14:41.520 --> 01:14:45.511
but in looking back, I think it's
best not to look for a fixed thing.

01:14:46.080 --> 01:14:50.310
Just tie into something nice when
you're away from the action...

01:14:50.560 --> 01:14:53.027
and let it wear itself out.

01:14:55.760 --> 01:14:59.660
- Boys? How about some food?
- Right with you, Shooter.

01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:03.422
Well, I'm glad we had
this little chat.

01:15:04.080 --> 01:15:06.706
I know we can be friends.

01:15:07.920 --> 01:15:10.182
Regardless of what happens.

01:15:10.280 --> 01:15:12.542
Yeah, that's right, Lancey.

01:15:12.680 --> 01:15:14.430
Regardless.

01:15:15.600 --> 01:15:17.543
Well, cheers.

01:15:18.760 --> 01:15:23.070
It's a whole new deal. Good hands
all around. Prosperity for everybody.

01:15:37.960 --> 01:15:41.223
You haven't lost your
touch, Lady Fingers.

01:15:42.240 --> 01:15:44.741
You hear Whistlin'
Sam's gone, Lancey?

01:15:44.800 --> 01:15:46.140
No, I haven't heard.

01:15:46.200 --> 01:15:49.383
Yeah. I had to go down to
the morgue to identify him.

01:15:50.200 --> 01:15:53.986
- He's a little younger than you, isn't he?
- Just deal, Lady Fingers.

01:15:54.040 --> 01:15:56.222
A deuce to the man.

01:15:56.640 --> 01:15:58.583
King, jack...

01:16:02.840 --> 01:16:05.068
Trey. Busted.

01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:12.545
Deuce.

01:16:12.600 --> 01:16:15.021
Ace-queen bets...

01:16:15.160 --> 01:16:17.945
What's in the pot? Four-twenty.

01:16:20.800 --> 01:16:22.789
It's yours, Shooter.

01:16:24.920 --> 01:16:26.260
Hoban?

01:16:27.280 --> 01:16:29.621
You mind shutting those drapes?

01:16:32.520 --> 01:16:35.544
Well, that makes me
about even, gentlemen.

01:16:36.160 --> 01:16:40.106
In a game like this, that's
a smart place to quit.

01:16:41.080 --> 01:16:44.548
If it's all right with all of
you, I'll just do the dealing.

01:16:44.600 --> 01:16:46.304
Sure.

01:16:47.520 --> 01:16:49.782
Ace-king bets.

01:16:50.160 --> 01:16:51.546
Doc...

01:16:51.600 --> 01:16:53.782
you're high. Ace-king bets.

01:16:53.840 --> 01:16:56.420
One moment, please.

01:17:11.320 --> 01:17:14.071
Nine hundred and thirty.

01:17:15.720 --> 01:17:18.426
You and that damn book.

01:17:18.520 --> 01:17:21.146
What are you writing
in that book, Sokal?

01:17:23.040 --> 01:17:25.586
Nine-thirty to you, Lancey.

01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:27.670
What have you got?

01:17:27.720 --> 01:17:29.151
It doesn't matter.

01:17:29.200 --> 01:17:31.302
If you can call, you can beat.

01:17:31.360 --> 01:17:33.667
Ace, king, seven.

01:17:33.720 --> 01:17:35.504
Ace, king, 10.

01:17:37.240 --> 01:17:39.308
How about that mess.

01:17:39.360 --> 01:17:42.350
I had them both beat
with a pair of fives.

01:17:42.760 --> 01:17:44.624
What do you keep betting out for?

01:17:44.720 --> 01:17:47.187
The bet was correct.
He should not have called.

01:17:47.240 --> 01:17:49.308
He shouldn't have, eh?

01:17:51.160 --> 01:17:54.104
Better write yourself
a new book, daddy.

01:17:55.480 --> 01:17:56.820
Gentlemen...

01:17:56.880 --> 01:17:58.345
I'm wasted.

01:17:58.440 --> 01:18:01.862
I'll settle for the 1700
that I've already lost.

01:18:01.960 --> 01:18:03.391
Later.

01:18:03.760 --> 01:18:06.545
Gentlemen, I, too, will withdraw.

01:18:13.080 --> 01:18:14.386
Well...

01:18:14.720 --> 01:18:17.107
just the two of us, Kid.

01:18:17.440 --> 01:18:19.383
Deal them up, Shooter.

01:18:25.960 --> 01:18:27.903
Cost you a grand.

01:18:32.040 --> 01:18:33.551
Well...

01:18:35.480 --> 01:18:38.231
Compulsory call, Kid.

01:18:44.800 --> 01:18:46.902
Two pair, jacks up.

01:18:46.960 --> 01:18:48.744
Kings up.

01:18:56.640 --> 01:18:58.424
Last card.

01:18:59.480 --> 01:19:01.662
Nine to the kings.

01:19:02.160 --> 01:19:04.661
Ace. Pair of aces bets.

01:19:04.760 --> 01:19:07.386
Bet the pot, 2700.

01:19:27.640 --> 01:19:30.186
- Two thousand.
- Call.

01:19:30.560 --> 01:19:32.389
Last card.

01:19:32.680 --> 01:19:35.784
Three sevens. Two
pair, 10s and sixes.

01:19:35.840 --> 01:19:38.705
- Three sevens bets.
- Two thousand more.

01:19:40.760 --> 01:19:42.589
Take it, Lancey.

01:19:42.640 --> 01:19:44.390
I can't beat three sevens.

01:19:47.360 --> 01:19:49.303
I'd like to take a
break now and sleep.

01:19:49.360 --> 01:19:52.145
It's not my place, because I'm
winners, but I'm saying it.

01:19:52.200 --> 01:19:55.747
Sure, sure. We'll start
again at 5. All right?

01:19:55.800 --> 01:19:57.311
Right.

01:20:42.160 --> 01:20:44.342
How's it going, Lancey?

01:20:44.640 --> 01:20:48.790
Lady, that young man is a
stud-poker-playing son of a...

01:20:48.840 --> 01:20:50.942
He's getting to you, huh, Lancey?

01:20:54.440 --> 01:20:56.781
No, not yet, he isn't.

01:21:11.200 --> 01:21:14.668
- I folded winners in that last hand.
- That's a hell of a thing to do.

01:21:14.760 --> 01:21:17.545
I got so lucky getting that
fifth card, I got embarrassed.

01:21:17.640 --> 01:21:19.469
You crazy? That's no
way to play poker.

01:21:19.560 --> 01:21:22.345
I thought it was time to ask,
what are you trying to pull?

01:21:22.400 --> 01:21:25.390
- Nothing. What are you talking about?
- You, Shooter, man.

01:21:25.480 --> 01:21:27.901
You been dealing me
cards for an hour.

01:21:27.960 --> 01:21:29.585
Like hell I...!

01:21:30.480 --> 01:21:34.062
No, Kid... No, listen. Listen, Kid.

01:21:34.320 --> 01:21:35.751
Kid.

01:21:35.800 --> 01:21:38.426
Even if I was, nobody could
spot it. You know that.

01:21:38.480 --> 01:21:40.787
I'm too good a mechanic.

01:22:04.840 --> 01:22:06.430
Kid...

01:22:08.200 --> 01:22:10.348
you gotta understand.

01:22:10.520 --> 01:22:12.941
This wasn't my idea.

01:22:15.840 --> 01:22:17.942
Look, Slade's got
the squeeze on me.

01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:20.944
Think I wanna deal phony? Think
it don't mean something to me?

01:22:21.040 --> 01:22:23.142
- With my reputation?
- Get this straight.

01:22:23.200 --> 01:22:25.462
No fix. You deal it
clean, or I'll blow it.

01:22:25.520 --> 01:22:28.464
- But Slade won't buy that.
- Slade ain't gonna know.

01:22:28.520 --> 01:22:31.464
I'm gonna win this game, Shooter.

01:22:34.200 --> 01:22:36.621
And I'm gonna win it my way.

01:22:38.200 --> 01:22:41.110
And you ride along with
it, or you're out.

01:22:43.200 --> 01:22:45.143
You're finished.

01:23:00.320 --> 01:23:01.660
Okay, Kid.

01:23:04.640 --> 01:23:07.823
I wanna leave a call
for 4 p.m. sharp.

01:23:08.320 --> 01:23:09.660
Yeah.

01:23:56.560 --> 01:23:58.389
This is Lancey Howard.

01:23:58.440 --> 01:24:01.225
Could you call me in a
couple of hours, please?

01:24:01.440 --> 01:24:03.190
Thank you.

01:24:06.720 --> 01:24:10.188
No, Lady, he hasn't
gotten through to me yet.

01:24:12.480 --> 01:24:14.901
But he damn well might.

01:25:00.280 --> 01:25:03.782
Good afternoon, sir. It's 4:00.

01:25:10.040 --> 01:25:11.949
It's only 25 to 4.

01:25:12.040 --> 01:25:15.144
You can stay right where you are.

01:25:15.200 --> 01:25:17.029
- Melba...
- Shh.

01:25:17.160 --> 01:25:19.786
I came to wake you up.

01:25:20.520 --> 01:25:23.271
You are awake, aren't you?

01:25:23.680 --> 01:25:25.544
Yeah, I'm awake.

01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:28.545
Well?

01:25:30.960 --> 01:25:32.983
You're quite a girl, Melba.

01:25:33.040 --> 01:25:35.586
Still worried about Shooter?

01:26:09.080 --> 01:26:11.945
You wanna get that, honey?
I ordered some coffee.

01:26:18.160 --> 01:26:19.785
Christian.

01:26:26.720 --> 01:26:29.221
They took a break in the
game to get some sleep...

01:26:29.280 --> 01:26:31.621
and Shooter sent me to wake him up.

01:26:42.680 --> 01:26:45.545
Well, I guess I'd better
get back downstairs.

01:26:46.520 --> 01:26:48.384
See you later.

01:27:03.480 --> 01:27:05.867
You sure got a great sense
of timing, Christian.

01:27:29.240 --> 01:27:33.140
- Anything happen?
- No, Kid paired kings. Won 100.

01:27:35.160 --> 01:27:36.785
Eight.

01:27:37.600 --> 01:27:40.783
Five. Queen bet.

01:27:41.000 --> 01:27:42.864
What have you got?

01:27:42.920 --> 01:27:44.670
Three nines.

01:27:48.600 --> 01:27:50.111
Eight Will bet 200.

01:27:51.480 --> 01:27:53.184
No stay.

01:27:54.160 --> 01:27:56.149
New deck, please.

01:27:58.160 --> 01:27:59.944
Two hundred.

01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:03.785
- And up five.
- Fold.

01:28:04.520 --> 01:28:06.110
Jack.

01:28:09.080 --> 01:28:11.547
Eights bet 2000.

01:28:11.640 --> 01:28:13.151
I'm not that curious.

01:28:13.200 --> 01:28:15.985
- Gents, I'm declaring a break.
- I don't want a break.

01:28:16.040 --> 01:28:18.268
Go on. Deal the cards.

01:28:18.520 --> 01:28:19.985
Same deck is good enough.

01:28:20.040 --> 01:28:21.983
No, I'll take a new deck.

01:28:22.400 --> 01:28:24.980
All right, all right.
Give him a new deck.

01:28:25.040 --> 01:28:26.665
Deal them.

01:28:27.680 --> 01:28:30.511
You wanna deal, deal them
yourselves. I'm going to the john.

01:28:30.560 --> 01:28:32.822
Gotta get something to
eat and take a nap.

01:28:32.880 --> 01:28:34.823
If you don't like it, you
can both go to hell.

01:28:42.240 --> 01:28:43.580
I guess that's it.

01:28:43.640 --> 01:28:45.583
Yeah, it looks that way.

01:28:45.640 --> 01:28:47.663
How long you wanna take?

01:28:47.920 --> 01:28:50.341
Well, let's make it an hour.
Okay with you?

01:28:50.400 --> 01:28:52.582
Sure. Sure.

01:28:55.920 --> 01:28:57.260
You Okay?

01:28:57.320 --> 01:29:00.867
Sure, sure. Just a little
stiff, that's all.

01:29:12.040 --> 01:29:14.381
Slade wants to see you.

01:29:14.600 --> 01:29:16.702
There's nothing to talk about.

01:29:16.760 --> 01:29:19.625
It'd be a big mistake to
think that, Mr. Stoner.

01:29:19.680 --> 01:29:21.305
Believe me.

01:29:36.880 --> 01:29:38.709
How do you like that steak, Kid?

01:29:44.120 --> 01:29:45.551
It's okay.

01:29:47.640 --> 01:29:49.151
It's good.

01:29:53.960 --> 01:29:57.428
I thought we should get together
and see whether we could...

01:29:57.480 --> 01:29:59.901
settle our differences.

01:30:06.640 --> 01:30:09.425
- What I told the Shooter goes.
- You gonna say no...

01:30:09.480 --> 01:30:11.389
before we've even discussed it?

01:30:16.640 --> 01:30:20.586
What am I to think? Are all
my arguments gonna be wasted?

01:30:22.160 --> 01:30:25.628
Why don't you give the Kid
some more salad there, Felix.

01:30:26.720 --> 01:30:28.549
No, thanks.

01:30:31.840 --> 01:30:33.624
Okay.

01:30:33.800 --> 01:30:36.107
We'll skip to the final argument.

01:30:38.480 --> 01:30:41.902
Old Shooter's gonna be dealing
again when the game starts.

01:30:42.040 --> 01:30:45.940
He's gonna give you an
occasional helpful card.

01:30:49.160 --> 01:30:52.150
- You call that an argument?
- No, that's a fact.

01:30:52.200 --> 01:30:55.622
The argument's leaning over
there against the door jamb.

01:31:04.000 --> 01:31:07.070
Now, let me give you a fact.
I'm not gonna let it happen.

01:31:07.120 --> 01:31:09.666
I'm gonna beat Lancey
Howard, Slade.

01:31:11.960 --> 01:31:13.983
But I don't need
your help to do it.

01:31:32.280 --> 01:31:34.621
Let him go, Felix.

01:32:00.920 --> 01:32:02.909
What's the matter
with you, Shooter?

01:32:04.840 --> 01:32:07.466
You don't look too good. Why
don't you lay down for a while?

01:32:07.520 --> 01:32:09.463
- You feeling all right?
- No, I'm okay.

01:32:09.520 --> 01:32:12.226
- What are you talking about?
- You know.

01:32:12.280 --> 01:32:14.860
- He's been sick all night.
- No, I'm all right.

01:32:14.960 --> 01:32:17.222
You should have said
something about it.

01:32:17.280 --> 01:32:20.065
We got Lady Fingers here,
or we can deal ourselves.

01:32:20.120 --> 01:32:22.063
- I'm fine. I tell you...
- Hoban.

01:32:22.120 --> 01:32:24.382
Wake up Lady Fingers.
Ask if she's ready.

01:32:24.440 --> 01:32:27.225
You ready, Lady Fingers?

01:32:34.760 --> 01:32:39.024
As Eddie the Dude said on his deathbed,
"I'm as ready as I'll ever be."

01:33:10.640 --> 01:33:14.222
I can't persuade myself
you have a flush.

01:33:19.480 --> 01:33:22.550
I'm gonna pay the price to
look at that third nine.

01:33:24.520 --> 01:33:27.021
I say the jack isn't there.

01:33:36.960 --> 01:33:39.745
My bet. Up five.

01:33:41.960 --> 01:33:43.550
Fold.

01:33:45.040 --> 01:33:46.630
The Kid's pushing him now.

01:33:47.800 --> 01:33:51.791
Old man's crumbling.
Kid's gonna take him yet.

01:33:55.560 --> 01:33:57.230
Eight.

01:33:58.720 --> 01:34:00.663
Ten. Ten bets.

01:34:00.720 --> 01:34:02.663
Five hundred.

01:34:11.440 --> 01:34:12.780
Deal.

01:34:12.840 --> 01:34:14.510
Pet's right.

01:34:14.560 --> 01:34:16.981
Queen and two diamonds.

01:34:18.520 --> 01:34:21.510
Pair of 10s. Tens bet.

01:34:24.200 --> 01:34:25.347
Thousand dollars.

01:34:31.680 --> 01:34:33.669
- Up 1.
- Seventy-five to 50.

01:34:33.720 --> 01:34:37.063
- He's paired the queens.
- Thousand to you, Kid.

01:34:41.480 --> 01:34:42.866
I'll just Call.

01:34:45.720 --> 01:34:47.663
Three diamonds and a possible.

01:34:48.600 --> 01:34:50.464
An ace to the 10s.

01:34:57.000 --> 01:34:58.545
Three thousand dollars.

01:35:08.720 --> 01:35:10.709
Three thousand to you, Lance.

01:35:23.240 --> 01:35:25.422
I don't think he will fold.

01:35:25.480 --> 01:35:28.060
And I don't think
he's got the queens.

01:35:28.120 --> 01:35:29.745
He's going for the flush.

01:35:33.480 --> 01:35:35.070
Reasonable bet.

01:35:36.800 --> 01:35:38.709
He's going for the flush.

01:35:43.440 --> 01:35:45.941
Kid's got him.
He's going all the way.

01:35:49.000 --> 01:35:50.750
Deal the cards.

01:35:54.160 --> 01:35:55.625
Nine of diamonds...

01:35:55.680 --> 01:35:57.270
and a possible flush.

01:35:57.680 --> 01:36:00.181
Possible straight flush.

01:36:00.280 --> 01:36:03.111
The ace of spades. Two pair.

01:36:04.840 --> 01:36:06.669
Two pair bet.

01:36:21.440 --> 01:36:23.304
Check to the possible.

01:36:28.720 --> 01:36:30.026
One thousand.

01:36:30.080 --> 01:36:31.460
He's got the flush.

01:36:35.360 --> 01:36:37.986
Call your thousand and raise...

01:36:41.840 --> 01:36:43.669
what I've got in front of me.

01:36:50.800 --> 01:36:52.140
Thirty-five hundred.

01:36:54.320 --> 01:36:56.821
That ace must have helped you, Kid.

01:37:14.880 --> 01:37:19.030
Call your 3500, and
I'll raise you...

01:37:21.400 --> 01:37:23.025
5000.

01:37:23.440 --> 01:37:25.861
By God, he's got the jack.

01:37:27.520 --> 01:37:29.782
- Couldn't have the jack.
- He didn't have queens.

01:37:29.840 --> 01:37:31.988
- He's got the jack of diamonds.
- No.

01:37:32.040 --> 01:37:34.620
- He's trying to buy it.
- Lancey's bluffing, ain't he?

01:37:34.680 --> 01:37:37.386
Sure, he is. He hasn't got
the jack. The Kid's got him.

01:37:37.440 --> 01:37:39.383
Yeah.

01:37:47.160 --> 01:37:49.547
<i>- The Kid's got him.
- The Kid's got him.</i>

01:37:49.600 --> 01:37:51.907
<i>You're right. The Kid's got him.</i>

01:37:52.520 --> 01:37:54.349
<i>I got him.</i>

01:37:54.400 --> 01:37:55.740
<i>I got the man.</i>

01:37:55.800 --> 01:37:58.221
Five thousand to you, Kid.

01:38:03.640 --> 01:38:05.549
I'll take your marker, Kid.

01:38:06.800 --> 01:38:08.345
I can get the money.

01:38:08.600 --> 01:38:10.225
I know you can.

01:38:12.120 --> 01:38:13.585
Okay. Let's see it.

01:38:26.800 --> 01:38:29.301
That's 5000 you owe me, Kid.

01:38:42.280 --> 01:38:44.109
You still playing, Kid?

01:38:47.520 --> 01:38:49.190
No.

01:38:49.240 --> 01:38:50.751
I'm through.

01:38:53.520 --> 01:38:56.624
You raised him 10s on
a lousy three flush.

01:38:56.800 --> 01:39:00.063
Gets down to what it's
all about, doesn't it?

01:39:00.840 --> 01:39:03.784
Making the wrong move
at the right time.

01:39:05.520 --> 01:39:07.384
Is that what it's all about?

01:39:12.840 --> 01:39:15.068
Like life, I guess.

01:39:15.640 --> 01:39:17.310
You're good, Kid...

01:39:17.360 --> 01:39:19.781
but as long as I'm around,
you're second best.

01:39:19.840 --> 01:39:21.783
You might as well
learn to live with it.

01:39:27.240 --> 01:39:28.671
What happened, Kid?

01:39:28.840 --> 01:39:31.671
- What's the tab for this whole show?
- Great play.

01:39:35.720 --> 01:39:37.345
You had to do it, didn't you?

01:39:37.400 --> 01:39:39.150
- You had to go your own way.
- Quiet.

01:39:39.240 --> 01:39:40.501
Listen, I'm sorry, Kid.

01:39:40.560 --> 01:39:43.823
I was wrong. I had you
figured for brains.

01:39:44.040 --> 01:39:47.781
You blew it this time, didn't
you, boy? You really blew it.

01:40:13.040 --> 01:40:14.346
Hey, Cincinnati.

01:40:14.440 --> 01:40:17.510
Come on, man. Come on.
I'm gonna get you one more time.

01:40:18.560 --> 01:40:20.981
Come on, Mr. Gambling-Man.

01:40:21.040 --> 01:40:22.551
I can cut you.

01:40:22.840 --> 01:40:24.863
I can do it.

01:40:25.400 --> 01:40:28.424
Stand up. Come on, Cincinnati.
Just one more time.

01:40:32.120 --> 01:40:35.064
Come on, man. What you afraid of?

01:40:37.280 --> 01:40:41.226
Come on. You get up here.
Just one more time.

01:40:41.800 --> 01:40:44.983
Come on, daddy. Let's
see you cut that.

01:40:45.040 --> 01:40:48.462
Come on, Cincinnati. Let's
see you cut it. Come on.

01:40:48.560 --> 01:40:51.391
Come on, Cincinnati.
Let's see you cut that.

01:41:01.120 --> 01:41:04.064
You tried too hard, man.

01:41:05.440 --> 01:41:08.191
You just ain't ready for me yet.

01:41:09.305 --> 01:41:15.317
