00:02.961 --> 00:05.078
I'm sure you're fine,
and I'm overreacting.

00:05.255 --> 00:08.042
And you just can't answer
your phone because...

00:08.217 --> 00:10.925
...for some reason
we'll be laughing about...

00:11.094 --> 00:13.586
...but something is wrong,
and something...

00:13.764 --> 00:15.801
<i>If satisfied with the message...</i>

00:15.974 --> 00:17.431
<i>- ...press one.</i>
- What is it?

00:17.601 --> 00:19.513
<i>- To record another message...</i>
- Tom.

00:19.978 --> 00:21.719
He's missing.

00:41.416 --> 00:42.907
I'm sorry.

00:52.427 --> 00:55.170
She didn't even know anything.
Neither did he.

00:55.347 --> 00:58.385
He had the bones. She was looking
for them. They knew enough.

00:58.559 --> 01:00.266
Question is what you know.

01:00.435 --> 01:03.678
Reddington sent you after the suitcase.
He tell you why?

01:03.855 --> 01:05.471
- He didn't.
- I don't think he did.

01:05.649 --> 01:09.814
Last thing he'd want is for you
to ID these. But you couldn't resist?

01:09.987 --> 01:14.573
So you and your friends ran a DNA search
through CODIS. Thank you, by the way.

01:14.741 --> 01:19.657
Curiosity killed these cats, but for me,
it's a gift that's gonna keep on giving.

01:19.830 --> 01:22.743
Whatever you imagine
the answer might be...

01:23.375 --> 01:25.162
...it's better than that.

01:27.379 --> 01:30.838
Reddington's power is legendary.
With this, I control that power.

01:31.300 --> 01:35.635
You're gonna set up a meeting between
us, so I can tell him the good news.

01:35.846 --> 01:38.259
But in case
you've had a change of heart.

02:11.715 --> 02:13.331
- I have eyes.
- How many?

02:13.508 --> 02:15.090
<i>Five hostiles. Maybe more.</i>

02:15.260 --> 02:16.376
Tom and the others?

02:16.553 --> 02:17.839
Status unknown.

02:18.013 --> 02:19.345
- But...
<i>- But what?</i>

02:19.514 --> 02:21.927
Raymond, it's not good.

02:22.100 --> 02:24.968
We're 20 minutes away.
I want an update in 10.

02:25.145 --> 02:26.511
We should have backup.

02:26.688 --> 02:29.647
Too many people know about
this situation already.

02:29.816 --> 02:32.354
This needs to end now.

02:35.447 --> 02:37.404
- Yes?
- It's me.

02:37.574 --> 02:40.612
I did what you hired me to do.
I got the package.

02:40.952 --> 02:42.159
Any problems?

02:42.663 --> 02:44.825
Nope. Piece of cake.

02:45.290 --> 02:46.371
Where are you now?

02:48.126 --> 02:51.915
A motel in Stone Ridge.
546 Roscoe Lane, Room 16.

02:52.089 --> 02:53.921
I can be there in half an hour.

02:55.842 --> 02:57.925
You three with me. The rest...

02:58.095 --> 02:59.461
- ...deal with him.
- Hey.

02:59.638 --> 03:01.925
- What about this?
- That stays.

03:02.099 --> 03:07.185
- Last thing I want is that near Reddington.
- I did what you asked. Now let me go.

03:11.441 --> 03:12.932
Plastic stays too.

03:13.110 --> 03:16.148
Any trouble, joins his pals.

03:18.740 --> 03:22.484
<i>Hey, it's Tom. Leave a message,
I will call you back.</i>

03:22.661 --> 03:25.324
Me again. And again and again.

03:25.497 --> 03:26.908
<i>This mailbox is full.</i>

03:27.082 --> 03:29.244
<i>It cannot accept messages.</i>

03:29.751 --> 03:32.744
We issued a BOLO.
Sent a message to every office.

03:32.921 --> 03:36.039
Sorry to put you through this.
I'm overreacting.

03:36.550 --> 03:40.794
Don't take this the wrong way. You
sure you know everything Tom is up to?

03:40.971 --> 03:42.712
I thought I did.

03:43.974 --> 03:45.215
I don't know.

03:48.311 --> 03:49.347
Red, anything?

03:49.521 --> 03:52.810
- I just spoke to you 20 minutes ago.
<i>- You had a lead.</i>

03:52.983 --> 03:55.851
- On Nik's death.
- You think the two are related?

03:56.027 --> 03:59.191
I'm doing what I can.
I'm sure Harold is as well.

03:59.364 --> 04:03.324
Trying to convince myself
everything's fine, but I'm doing terrible.

04:03.493 --> 04:07.578
<i>Tom is capable of getting himself
both into and out of trouble.</i>

04:07.748 --> 04:11.037
<i>If he's in harm's way
I'm certain he's put in motion...</i>

04:11.209 --> 04:15.749
...an escape plan about which the people
holding him are completely unaware.

04:15.922 --> 04:17.709
<i>Who would be holding him? Why?</i>

04:17.882 --> 04:20.671
- Did he take a job he didn't tell me about?
<i>- It appears so.</i>

04:20.844 --> 04:24.337
I'm sorry. I know that's not
the answer you wanna hear.

04:24.514 --> 04:27.757
Well, call me if you find anything out.

04:28.727 --> 04:31.515
Got a hit on Tom's car.
Impound lot towed it in last night.

04:31.688 --> 04:33.475
Towed from where?

04:37.611 --> 04:39.318
Agents Ressler and Keen, FBI.

04:39.488 --> 04:43.277
We have reason to believe this man
was here. Have you seen him?

04:44.075 --> 04:47.364
- Can't say.
- His car was impounded outside Room 11.

04:48.455 --> 04:51.823
- Don't know anything about that.
- "Can't say, don't know"?

04:52.000 --> 04:54.242
- I mind my business.
- Can we get the key?

04:54.419 --> 04:56.752
Sure. Soon as you get a warrant.

04:56.922 --> 04:59.130
You know what? Forget the key.

05:15.565 --> 05:18.182
- We don't know he was here.
- His car was parked outside.

05:18.360 --> 05:20.272
- He came.
- In front of this room.

05:20.445 --> 05:22.812
Maybe this was the only space, Liz.

05:26.993 --> 05:31.078
I've called Tom so many times
his mailbox is full. It's pointless.

05:31.248 --> 05:33.831
Hearing his voice
is the only thing that calms me down.

05:34.000 --> 05:36.959
I'm gonna call CSI.
If Tom was here, they'll know.

06:06.533 --> 06:07.899
Hey, you mind if I sit?

06:08.326 --> 06:09.692
Knock yourself out.

06:09.870 --> 06:11.907
Yeah, well, can I get a hand?

06:16.877 --> 06:21.338
- Gosh, anything else I can do for you?
- Yeah, you could give me your gun.

06:21.673 --> 06:24.416
Looks like
we got ourselves a comedian.

06:29.431 --> 06:31.047
Not that funny, is it?

06:46.740 --> 06:48.572
- What?
- He got away.

06:48.950 --> 06:49.940
The suitcase?

06:55.707 --> 06:58.040
- Get it back.
<i>- What about Reddington?</i>

06:58.209 --> 06:59.620
Reddington's not coming.

06:59.794 --> 07:01.786
<i>He was never coming.</i>

07:28.573 --> 07:29.984
Get in.

07:33.328 --> 07:34.318
Tom.

07:35.914 --> 07:36.904
Oh, hell.

07:53.390 --> 07:56.679
I warned you about this damn suitcase.
Now look at you.

08:04.442 --> 08:07.185
They hit the radiator. And the oil pan.

08:07.404 --> 08:10.112
- They'll be here soon.
- Who will? Who are they?

08:10.281 --> 08:14.150
- I was hoping you could tell us.
- Nik had a friend. Took DNA...

08:14.327 --> 08:18.446
...off the bones, ran a match,
got killed for his troubles. So did Nik.

08:18.623 --> 08:20.831
- And Lena?
- How do you know about her?

08:22.127 --> 08:25.120
- We have to move.
- I warned you and your friends.

08:25.296 --> 08:29.882
Friends? The guy who threatened Lena,
told her to stop looking, he worked for you.

08:30.260 --> 08:32.547
You need to keep that compressed.

08:33.847 --> 08:35.383
Which way?

08:38.351 --> 08:40.263
Away from the road.

08:40.437 --> 08:41.722
West.

08:41.895 --> 08:44.604
- Can you walk?
- Guess we'll find out.

08:51.531 --> 08:54.774
According to this manager,
Room 11 was rented to a Steven Smith.

08:54.951 --> 08:57.819
But the license he used was a fake,
he paid cash for the room.

08:57.996 --> 09:01.364
- Any video?
- Manager won't give it without a warrant.

09:01.541 --> 09:04.033
- Work in progress.
- There was a struggle. Anyone hear?

09:04.210 --> 09:06.372
We interviewed guests,
cleaning crew. Nothing.

09:06.546 --> 09:08.663
I don't know where Tom went
after the motel...

09:08.840 --> 09:11.423
...but I do know where he was
before he went there.

09:11.593 --> 09:14.085
A gas station on 211.
East of Warrenton.

09:14.262 --> 09:17.471
- How do you know that?
- I hacked the navigation system on his car.

09:17.640 --> 09:20.804
It may be a coincidence,
but based on the time log...

09:20.977 --> 09:25.472
...it looks as if he was there when
the station was being vandalized.

09:25.648 --> 09:28.482
Ressler, Keen, get to the scene.
Talk to the station owner.

09:29.069 --> 09:33.313
Whatever Tom is doing, I'm sure
he's got a good reason for doing it.

09:41.414 --> 09:43.246
Maybe you were right.

09:43.541 --> 09:45.077
If I'd left well enough alone...

09:45.543 --> 09:49.253
- ...none of this would've happened.
- Spare me your regret.

09:50.340 --> 09:52.332
I only did it...

09:52.509 --> 09:54.250
...because you lied.

09:58.807 --> 10:00.389
We need water.

10:00.558 --> 10:01.924
First aid.

10:02.102 --> 10:03.434
Stay here.

10:03.603 --> 10:05.811
I will see if it's safe.

10:06.898 --> 10:08.230
Come on.

10:21.121 --> 10:24.740
- This is a secret.
- A secret you've been keeping from Liz.

10:25.041 --> 10:26.998
Like you always do.

10:28.211 --> 10:30.703
Like you have from the very beginning.

10:31.381 --> 10:33.498
The assignment's deep cover.

10:33.675 --> 10:35.041
No time line.

10:35.218 --> 10:36.459
No price tag.

10:37.178 --> 10:39.215
This may seem like a cakewalk.

10:39.889 --> 10:43.098
But it's the kind of assignment
that makes me nervous.

10:43.434 --> 10:45.346
Our contractor has deep pockets.

10:45.520 --> 10:46.852
Demands the best...

10:47.063 --> 10:49.680
...insists on anonymity.

10:50.859 --> 10:53.647
- She's cute.
- That's one more thing he insists on.

10:53.820 --> 10:57.985
Your job's to be the friend of a friend.
Get to know this Milhoan.

10:58.408 --> 11:00.400
Not to get involved with her.

11:00.577 --> 11:02.910
Just be a friend of a friend.

11:03.079 --> 11:04.320
You get that?

11:05.373 --> 11:07.581
You couldn't leave well enough alone.

11:07.750 --> 11:08.957
Not then, not now.

11:09.127 --> 11:12.837
- You hired me to spy on Liz.
- I hired you to protect her.

11:13.006 --> 11:14.167
No one is home.

11:15.300 --> 11:18.088
We go in, get fixed up and get out.

11:18.261 --> 11:20.548
They can't be far behind.

11:21.181 --> 11:25.221
They wouldn't backtrack
towards the compound. Too risky.

11:25.685 --> 11:28.177
Notify the others.
They're headed west.

11:28.354 --> 11:31.392
Between 4:30 and 5,
a man and a woman entered the store.

11:31.566 --> 11:34.058
The woman distracted the clerk.
Her accomplice went...

11:34.235 --> 11:36.568
- ...into the back unnoticed.
- You identify them?

11:36.738 --> 11:39.401
Got a shot of the woman,
ID'd as Lena Mercer.

11:39.574 --> 11:41.440
Any address or a place of work?

11:41.618 --> 11:43.860
Both. She moved out.
On leave from her job.

11:44.037 --> 11:45.949
- Her accomplice?
- Caucasian, 30s.

11:46.122 --> 11:48.455
Since nothing was taken,
we're not looking hard.

11:48.625 --> 11:51.868
- Mind telling me why you are?
- He went in the back. Why?

11:52.045 --> 11:55.083
Employee said
he was looking at surveillance tapes.

11:55.298 --> 11:58.917
Police report said Tom pulled
surveillance off two cameras.

11:59.093 --> 12:01.836
Station manager's best guess
is he was looking at this.

12:02.305 --> 12:04.092
Okay. And the other camera?

12:06.309 --> 12:09.347
There. Stop the tape.
Can you zoom in on that car?

12:11.522 --> 12:14.515
- What is that? A hotel key?
- "Red Birch."

12:16.986 --> 12:18.477
That must be Steve Smith.

12:18.655 --> 12:21.568
Tom and Lena,
they came here looking for this guy.

12:21.908 --> 12:24.651
They see the room key,
go to the motel, there's a fight...

12:24.827 --> 12:27.820
...and the three of them are now
in the wind or on the run. Why?

12:27.997 --> 12:30.284
We have her name
and the VIN number on his car...

12:30.458 --> 12:34.577
...so I'll circulate both,
put a BOLO out, and we'll find them.

12:35.380 --> 12:37.918
And when we find them, we find Tom.

13:17.672 --> 13:19.755
Your curiosity is understandable.

13:19.924 --> 13:22.166
A mysterious suitcase...

13:22.343 --> 13:26.007
...bequeathed to you by a dying woman
who insists Elizabeth...

13:26.180 --> 13:28.388
...must be apprised of its contents.

13:30.143 --> 13:34.228
But what if instead of
happiness or closure...

13:34.397 --> 13:37.561
...giving it to her
has the opposite effect?

13:37.734 --> 13:39.020
It won't.

13:39.193 --> 13:40.559
How can you be so sure?

13:40.737 --> 13:43.275
Because you don't want her
to know about it.

13:46.367 --> 13:50.782
You've always seen my relationship
with Elizabeth as a zero-sum game.

13:51.122 --> 13:54.081
You think what's good for me
is bad for her.

13:54.542 --> 13:57.410
And what's good for her is bad for me.

13:57.587 --> 13:59.670
Only when it comes
to things she cares about.

13:59.839 --> 14:01.375
Like you?

14:01.549 --> 14:05.042
You made it clear from the beginning
how you felt about me.

14:05.511 --> 14:09.505
The contractor is livid.
You weren't to get involved with the mark.

14:09.682 --> 14:12.766
- Her name is Elizabeth.
- I don't care if she's Queen Elizabeth...

14:12.935 --> 14:18.647
...and screwing her made you king.
Get out. He will kill you if you don't.

14:18.816 --> 14:20.352
You'll need clothes.

14:21.152 --> 14:23.189
Admit it. You're enjoying this.

14:23.363 --> 14:28.779
It would've been easier if the bullet hit
you just another foot to the northeast.

14:47.887 --> 14:49.674
We stayed too long. Put it back.

14:49.847 --> 14:51.930
- You can trust me.
- No, I can't.

14:52.100 --> 14:55.468
I hired you to do a job. The rules
were explicit, you violated them.

14:55.645 --> 14:56.852
Let it go already.

14:58.689 --> 15:01.397
- You're unreliable.
- Well, I fell in love.

15:01.567 --> 15:02.978
That's no excuse.

15:03.194 --> 15:05.106
I wasn't making one.

15:08.699 --> 15:11.533
If we're not surrounded,
we will be soon.

15:21.254 --> 15:23.837
We got a match
on the VIN number for Mr. Smith's car.

15:24.006 --> 15:27.670
His real name is Peter Alan McGee,
resident of Largo, Maryland.

15:27.844 --> 15:29.676
- His prints were in the system?
- Yes.

15:29.846 --> 15:32.964
Not because of priors, which he has.
He's wanted for questioning...

15:33.141 --> 15:37.101
...in the murder of one Nik Korpal.

15:38.187 --> 15:40.520
- Wanted? Why?
- According to police records...

15:40.690 --> 15:43.854
...McGee received a call
from Nik on the night of his death.

15:44.026 --> 15:45.733
Two hours before his body was found.

15:45.903 --> 15:48.520
- He's been MIA ever since.
- That's what Tom was up to.

15:48.698 --> 15:51.816
- Trying to find out who killed Nik.
- Ressler, reach out to M.P.D.C.

15:51.993 --> 15:54.827
If McGee's a person of interest,
they'll have a file.

15:54.996 --> 15:58.285
Navabi, get in touch
with the D.C. field office. This is a priority.

15:58.458 --> 16:01.041
I want bureau-wide resources
digging into McGee's life.

16:01.210 --> 16:05.124
Financials, cell records. I wanna know
everything there is to know about this kid.

16:12.430 --> 16:14.296
Check the property.

16:15.349 --> 16:16.931
They're here.

19:49.772 --> 19:51.308
Well, that was fun.

19:51.941 --> 19:53.557
Oh, man.

19:53.734 --> 19:55.646
If you don't trust me by now...

19:56.153 --> 20:00.773
...this whole "father-in-law hates
his son-in-law" thing, it's clichÃ©.

20:00.950 --> 20:02.862
Can we just put a stake in it?

20:03.285 --> 20:04.776
You go first.

20:04.954 --> 20:06.911
Who's in the suitcase?

20:11.919 --> 20:15.754
I was in the Andes when
I heard you and Elizabeth were engaged.

20:16.549 --> 20:19.963
Agents in the Colombian government
had solicited my help...

20:20.136 --> 20:24.801
...in negotiating the release of soldiers
being held by FARC rebels.

20:24.974 --> 20:29.093
At the time, I was a rare intermediary,
having brokered...

20:29.270 --> 20:33.310
...sales of arms and equipment to
both sides in the conflict.

20:34.108 --> 20:38.443
I was unable to return
until the day of your wedding.

20:41.699 --> 20:44.191
Seeing her that day...

20:44.368 --> 20:47.327
<i>Wait a minute,
you were at our wedding?</i>

20:47.496 --> 20:49.988
<i>She was incandescent.</i>

20:51.459 --> 20:56.875
I'd come out of the mountains,
blinded by rage, flown 2300 miles...

20:57.047 --> 20:59.755
...absolutely certain that you must die.

20:59.925 --> 21:01.291
And then...

21:02.178 --> 21:04.465
<i>...I saw Elizabeth.</i>

21:05.639 --> 21:10.885
<i>I'm a violent man.
A terrible, powerful, violent man.</i>

21:12.813 --> 21:15.726
But the way she looked at you...

21:15.900 --> 21:17.687
...the way she...

21:19.069 --> 21:20.731
...loves you...

21:23.532 --> 21:25.990
...I'm powerless against that.

21:29.038 --> 21:31.826
Are you not gonna tell me
who's in the suitcase?

21:32.625 --> 21:34.036
Or are you?

21:35.419 --> 21:37.536
I'll say this for you.

21:38.339 --> 21:42.424
You've always believed that
you were acting in her best interest.

21:43.052 --> 21:45.089
Selling me out to Berlin,
faking her death.

21:45.262 --> 21:49.222
You've always thought
you were helping her.

21:51.268 --> 21:53.510
I appreciate you saying that.

21:58.484 --> 22:00.066
You should change.

22:00.569 --> 22:02.561
You make her happy.

22:24.468 --> 22:28.587
What? You're always telling me
to make peace. I made peace.

22:29.515 --> 22:31.632
You're still lying to him...

22:31.809 --> 22:33.801
...and to Elizabeth.

22:33.978 --> 22:37.471
Until you stop lying,
there will be no peace.

23:13.767 --> 23:14.848
Hey, we got a hit.

23:15.019 --> 23:18.558
The detectives investigating McGee
were called to a site with homicides.

23:18.731 --> 23:22.475
Absolutely horrific scene, but they
were able to confirm one of the victims...

23:22.651 --> 23:23.687
...Peter Alan McGee.

23:24.111 --> 23:25.943
- The others?
- They didn't...

23:28.616 --> 23:31.654
Text me when you get an address.
Call me when you know more.

23:31.827 --> 23:33.819
Ressler, let's go.

24:04.151 --> 24:05.983
It's okay, Keen. He's okay.

24:06.153 --> 24:08.019
- Where is he?
- Look, Tom's a big boy.

24:08.197 --> 24:10.985
Whoever he's mixed up with
is capable of this.

24:11.158 --> 24:13.445
- Keen, come here.
- I can't...

24:13.827 --> 24:16.069
- Ressler, I can't...
- It's okay.

24:16.789 --> 24:18.451
It's gonna be okay.

24:24.254 --> 24:25.370
<i>Attention, please.</i>

24:25.547 --> 24:28.585
<i>This is a boarding call
for train MARC 310 to Baltimore...</i>

24:28.759 --> 24:34.471
<i>...with intermediary stops at Seabrook,
Bowie State, Odenton and BWI Airport.</i>

24:34.640 --> 24:37.849
<i>Through passengers,
stay on the train to Baltimore.</i>

24:43.816 --> 24:47.435
<i>Thank you for choosing to ride
the MARC Train.</i>

25:28.861 --> 25:31.023
- Keen.
<i>- Liz.</i>

25:31.780 --> 25:32.896
Oh, my God. Tom.

25:33.073 --> 25:35.736
I've been worried sick about you.

25:35.909 --> 25:37.741
- Tell me you're okay.
- I'm okay.

25:37.911 --> 25:38.901
<i>What's going on?</i>

25:39.079 --> 25:41.366
- Where are you?
- I need to see you now.

25:41.540 --> 25:43.372
<i>- What's wrong?</i>
- Listen to me.

25:43.542 --> 25:47.001
Do what I say. Do not tell anyone
we spoke or that you know I'm okay.

25:47.171 --> 25:50.164
What are you talking about?
I got half the FBI looking for you.

25:50.340 --> 25:53.253
I need to see you alone.
Have Rosa take Agnes.

25:53.427 --> 25:56.340
Go to the house.
Make sure nobody follows you.

25:56.513 --> 25:58.846
Tom, tell me what's going on.

25:59.016 --> 26:02.054
I figured it out, the whole thing.
Why Nik was killed, all of it.

26:02.227 --> 26:05.311
- You're scaring me.
- Go to the house. Meet me there.

26:05.481 --> 26:09.270
And when it's safe, babe,
I'm gonna explain everything.

26:19.787 --> 26:22.495
- Mr. Reddington?
- Have you spoken to Elizabeth?

26:22.664 --> 26:24.075
<i>No. Why?</i>

26:24.249 --> 26:27.458
I believe Tom Keen is entangled
in some nasty business.

26:27.628 --> 26:29.665
He may be involving Elizabeth.

26:29.838 --> 26:32.251
- Might explain why she's missing.
- What do you mean?

26:32.424 --> 26:35.417
<i>She was with Ressler at
a crime scene following up on a lead...</i>

26:35.594 --> 26:38.086
...looking for Tom, when she...

26:38.680 --> 26:40.797
- She vanished.
- Have you tried to reach her?

26:40.974 --> 26:44.092
She's not picking up.
Her cell is going to voicemail.

26:44.269 --> 26:47.478
In fact, she may have shut off
the GPS in her phone...

26:47.648 --> 26:50.311
...because when I tried to track her,
it's gone.

26:50.484 --> 26:53.192
- Any way of contacting her?
<i>- We're looking.</i>

26:53.403 --> 26:55.645
<i>I pulled the call log
from her service provider.</i>

26:55.823 --> 26:57.564
The last call she received...

26:57.741 --> 27:02.156
...was just under 12 minutes ago
from a pay phone at Union Station.

27:02.329 --> 27:03.661
Tom.

27:06.500 --> 27:08.412
He's at Union Station.

28:04.850 --> 28:08.218
<i>Tom Keen,
please pick up a red courtesy.</i>

28:08.395 --> 28:13.186
<i>Mr. Tom Keen,
please pick up a red courtesy phone.</i>

28:16.570 --> 28:18.402
<i>This is a horrible mistake.</i>

28:18.572 --> 28:21.736
Whatever you're doing,
whatever you're going to tell Elizabeth...

28:21.909 --> 28:23.366
...this is a mistake.

28:23.535 --> 28:25.197
Walk away from this, Tom.

28:25.370 --> 28:27.612
- You know I can't do that.
<i>- Why's that?</i>

28:27.789 --> 28:29.325
Because I know the truth.

28:29.917 --> 28:32.000
<i>I know everything.</i>

28:32.169 --> 28:34.411
And now Liz is gonna know too.

28:48.393 --> 28:50.350
Tom. Oh, my God.

28:50.520 --> 28:52.682
I have no idea what's going...

28:58.028 --> 29:01.066
You must be the wife.
What's your name, darling?

29:05.035 --> 29:06.526
Get her in a chair.

29:07.579 --> 29:09.036
No, no.

29:09.206 --> 29:10.287
No.

29:11.500 --> 29:14.413
You sure are a little spitfire, aren't you?

29:14.586 --> 29:17.374
Found it in the kid's room.

29:17.547 --> 29:19.288
It's all here.

29:21.551 --> 29:22.837
No, please.

29:23.011 --> 29:25.424
What do you want? Please.

29:25.597 --> 29:29.216
I'd like to think I'm the kind of man
who would politely ask you to stop this.

29:29.393 --> 29:30.884
To let this end here.

29:31.061 --> 29:35.931
But I can tell you're the kind of guy
who won't get the message and stop.

29:36.108 --> 29:38.942
So we're gonna need
to make sure you stop.

29:39.111 --> 29:40.522
So...

29:41.154 --> 29:42.565
...sorry about this.

29:44.992 --> 29:47.234
No! No!

29:47.869 --> 29:49.701
No!

30:09.224 --> 30:11.261
What makes you think
they're at the house?

30:11.435 --> 30:13.222
He's in trouble. He's desperate.

30:13.812 --> 30:15.929
He won't leave without
Elizabeth and Agnes.

30:16.106 --> 30:18.814
- You haven't asked my opinion.
- No, I haven't.

30:18.984 --> 30:21.442
Why can't you be honest with her?

30:22.279 --> 30:24.066
I don't know.

30:24.990 --> 30:26.481
I don't know.

30:26.658 --> 30:28.445
Even after everything that's happened.

30:28.952 --> 30:32.616
- All that's been lost...
- How far until the damn house?

30:37.294 --> 30:41.709
I'm gonna ask you one more time, Tom.
I need you to call Reddington for me.

30:41.965 --> 30:43.331
Tom.

30:43.842 --> 30:45.424
Can you hear me, Tom?

30:47.220 --> 30:49.303
Tom, I said...

30:49.473 --> 30:52.011
...I need you to call Reddington for me.

30:53.268 --> 30:57.763
- I don't think I'm gonna do that.
- So we'll go at it again with the blade?

30:58.732 --> 31:00.394
Okay.

31:13.455 --> 31:14.866
We got what we came for.

31:15.040 --> 31:16.656
Finish them off.

31:18.043 --> 31:19.875
Clean up the bodies.

31:22.005 --> 31:23.587
Let's have some fun.

34:25.730 --> 34:29.188
- He's lost a lot of blood.
- Call Harold. We're going to the hospital.

34:29.359 --> 34:32.726
- Raymond, they're not going to make it.
- Call them.

35:04.352 --> 35:06.765
S.O.D., this is Agent Navabi.
We have an agent down.

35:06.938 --> 35:10.102
Requesting emergency escort.
Roads blocked from 6th and Florida...

35:10.275 --> 35:13.143
...to D.C. General.
This is a life-and-death situation.

35:25.206 --> 35:26.617
Hey.

35:28.126 --> 35:29.992
You are so...

35:30.587 --> 35:31.998
...beautiful.

35:32.380 --> 35:34.622
You're the most beautiful.

35:35.091 --> 35:36.753
Liz.

35:39.262 --> 35:40.594
My Liz.

35:45.185 --> 35:46.221
Tom.

35:46.394 --> 35:47.430
Liz.

35:48.605 --> 35:50.267
Promise me.

35:51.691 --> 35:53.353
Promise.

35:54.819 --> 35:57.527
Tell Agnes about me.

35:57.739 --> 35:59.696
I won't have to. Look at me.

36:01.618 --> 36:04.406
Stay with me, babe, please.

36:04.621 --> 36:06.078
Please.

36:06.665 --> 36:09.703
- Say it, please.
- Stay with me.

36:10.835 --> 36:12.872
Babe, please.

36:14.089 --> 36:15.330
How long?

36:15.548 --> 36:17.210
Two minutes, maybe less.

36:17.967 --> 36:19.083
You hear that?

36:19.969 --> 36:21.631
We're almost there.

36:21.888 --> 36:24.676
Hey.

36:25.016 --> 36:26.723
You're gonna make it.

36:28.228 --> 36:29.264
Liz.

36:32.857 --> 36:34.519
Liz, you have to make it.

36:40.824 --> 36:43.407
I can't live without you.

36:44.160 --> 36:45.822
Liz?

36:46.079 --> 36:48.287
Liz, you gotta stay.

37:22.115 --> 37:24.823
Laryngoscope. ET tube.

37:25.744 --> 37:29.454
Let's get her to CAT scan, stat.
I wanna rule out subdural.

37:30.415 --> 37:31.951
Stay with me. Can you hear me?

37:32.667 --> 37:35.876
- BP's 60 palp.
- I want to tap his belly, stat.

37:36.045 --> 37:39.038
Where's the neurosurgeon?
We don't open her skull, she dies.

37:39.215 --> 37:41.457
They're pulling him out of the OR.
Four minutes.

37:41.676 --> 37:42.837
He's in v-fib.

37:43.052 --> 37:44.384
Charging.

37:45.263 --> 37:46.299
Clear.

37:49.517 --> 37:51.053
Amp of epi.

39:17.689 --> 39:22.480
<i>I thank whatever gods may be
for my unconquerable soul.</i>

39:22.652 --> 39:25.770
<i>In the fell clutch of circumstance...</i>

39:25.947 --> 39:28.781
<i>...I have not winced nor cried aloud.</i>

39:28.992 --> 39:33.953
<i>Under the bludgeonings of chance,
my head is bloody, but unbowed.</i>

39:34.122 --> 39:37.365
<i>Beyond this place of wrath and tears...</i>

39:37.542 --> 39:40.876
<i>...looms but the horror of the shade.</i>

39:41.045 --> 39:45.790
<i>And yet the menace of the years finds,
and shall find, me unafraid.</i>

39:46.384 --> 39:49.798
<i>It matters not how strait the gate...</i>

39:49.971 --> 39:53.385
<i>...how charged with punishments
the scroll...</i>

39:54.559 --> 39:57.393
<i>...I am the master of my fate.</i>

39:58.646 --> 40:01.354
<i>I am the captain of my soul.</i>

40:16.414 --> 40:18.246
Oh, my God.

40:18.625 --> 40:21.083
Oh, my God, Elizabeth.

40:25.965 --> 40:28.753
Agnes will be so excited.

40:36.809 --> 40:38.175
What?

40:38.353 --> 40:40.561
Oh, yes. Of course.

41:01.084 --> 41:02.120
Elizabeth.

41:07.090 --> 41:09.082
It's been nearly a year.

41:12.345 --> 41:14.211
Ten months.

41:54.762 --> 41:56.594
Tom is dead.
