- I want both, but I want to
start with our own kids first.

- Okay.
I'm sure you know the basics,

that you would be using
an egg donor and a surrogate.

02:55.567 --> 02:57.567

- Half siblings, right?

03:11.300 --> 03:13.433
- No, they'd be twins.
- They are twins?

- If they're--if they're--
if they're delivered

03:14.700 --> 03:16.266

- So you each want to

03:18.000 --> 03:20.433
provide sperm; you each want to
become a biological father.

- Right.
- Okay.

Okay.

03:25.266 --> 03:28.467

03:28.467 --> 03:32.066
Not only do her genetics provide
the genetics of your child,

have a profound impact

03:35.667 --> 03:38.333

and success rates.

03:38.333 --> 03:40.567
- How much does the final kid
cost?

03:40.567 --> 03:44.066
- The entire process, egg donor,
surrogacy, medical costs,

03:44.066 --> 03:48.000
is somewhere between the low end
I'd say about 120,000

03:48.000 --> 03:51.300
