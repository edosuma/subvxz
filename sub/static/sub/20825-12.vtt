WEBVTT

00:06.006 --> 00:08.424
I really wish I could have
changed your mind, Cathy.

00:08.425 --> 00:09.968
- I just...
- Because, you know...

00:09.970 --> 00:12.302
you know, this is just not good for you.

00:12.304 --> 00:15.139
The negotiations with the committee
are just too far down the road.

00:15.140 --> 00:16.850
Well, you agreed to see me
because you're smart.

00:16.851 --> 00:19.060
Because doubt is what
you should be having.

00:19.061 --> 00:20.812
Look, Cathy, I respect you.

00:20.813 --> 00:23.439
We wouldn't have lasted as long together
if I didn't.

00:23.440 --> 00:26.693
- My husband's waiting for me.
- But you're gonna be made to look a fool.

00:26.694 --> 00:28.319
There's no need to insult me, Francis.

00:28.320 --> 00:31.239
Witness after witness is gonna rebut
whatever you have to say.

00:31.240 --> 00:33.157
My testimony is what it is.

00:33.158 --> 00:36.035
It'll all be resolved
in the court of public opinion.

00:36.036 --> 00:38.371
Yes, but who is the public
going to believe?

00:38.372 --> 00:42.125
You or explosive residue
on a terrorist's computer?

00:42.126 --> 00:45.920
Look, Cathy, your testimony's gonna seem
petty and vengeful.

00:45.921 --> 00:48.381
And then where is that gonna leave you?
What prospects?

00:48.382 --> 00:49.549
It's too late.

00:50.300 --> 00:53.136
- You need to take a fall.
- Excuse me?

00:53.137 --> 00:54.929
Look, the committee is just gonna
have to wait.

00:54.930 --> 00:56.973
In two weeks, it's gonna be over anyway,

00:56.974 --> 00:58.975
and you're gonna be
on the wrong side of this thing.

00:58.976 --> 01:01.937
- Well, we'll see.
- Yes, we will.

01:02.520 --> 01:03.856
After you.

01:05.899 --> 01:07.901
But I meant what I said, Cathy.

01:13.406 --> 01:14.742
Cathy?

01:15.784 --> 01:16.785
Cathy?

01:17.452 --> 01:21.164
Help! Help! The secretary has fallen!

03:03.683 --> 03:05.268
You're a lucky bastard.

03:05.269 --> 03:08.521
Oh, not until the end of the night.
Or should I say, the morning.

03:08.522 --> 03:11.107
Catherine Durant fell? How?

03:11.108 --> 03:15.612
- Well, people fall. That's what they do.
- Yes, they fall when they need to.

03:16.989 --> 03:18.949
Your new friend
is still gonna get impeached.

03:19.742 --> 03:21.701
Well, I hope I can still count

03:21.702 --> 03:24.537
on the good senator's support
when the time comes.

03:26.456 --> 03:28.124
You're a good card player, Mark.

03:28.125 --> 03:30.877
You never talk shop at the table.
It's always when you're cashing out.

03:30.878 --> 03:32.545
Well, my mother raised me well.

03:34.089 --> 03:36.759
The numbers are getting harder and harder
for the senator.

03:37.843 --> 03:41.429
- Why is that?
- The money and the calls coming in.

03:41.430 --> 03:43.264
One number goes down,
and the other one goes up.

03:43.265 --> 03:46.017
The senator's feeling the heat,
from where?

03:46.018 --> 03:47.936
Why don't you come in later.
We can talk about it then.

03:47.937 --> 03:49.729
No, no, no. Wait a minute.

03:49.730 --> 03:52.648
Danny... I'm counting on his vote.

03:52.649 --> 03:54.150
- Well, you can count it out.
- No. No...

03:54.151 --> 03:56.319
And half of the Democrats as well.

03:56.320 --> 03:58.321
Forget about censure,
the House hasn't even voted yet

03:58.322 --> 04:00.032
on articles of impeachment.

04:01.241 --> 04:02.826
You're not the only one
working the Senate.

04:03.410 --> 04:06.204
- Someone wants Francis out.
- And I'm asking you who.

04:07.497 --> 04:10.333
You've been around a long time.
Nobody tells you how to vote.

04:10.334 --> 04:12.544
They just tell you what happens
if you don't go their way.

04:14.629 --> 04:16.464
Oil's at $50 a barrel.

04:16.464 --> 04:18.175
Nobody's happy with that.

05:29.830 --> 05:31.622
<i>We were hoping
to bring you live coverage</i>

05:31.623 --> 05:33.416
<i>of the judiciary hearing today.</i>

05:33.417 --> 05:37.128
<i>But given the postponement due to
Secretary Durant's unexpected absence,</i>

05:37.129 --> 05:40.298
<i>we'll be switching to the Armed Services
Committee meeting instead,</i>

05:40.299 --> 05:42.133
<i>- </i> Ma'am?
<i>- Where several military officials...</i>

05:42.134 --> 05:44.177
<i>are citing the increased threat
of ICO...</i>

05:44.178 --> 05:45.553
Today's schedule.

05:46.554 --> 05:49.641
And I thought you might wanna see this.
It's a note from Tom Yates.

05:57.190 --> 06:00.860
Oh, and reminder, we have to get back
to the Soldier Recovery Project.

06:30.015 --> 06:31.599
<i>Peace.</i>

06:31.600 --> 06:33.767
That's our goal.

06:33.768 --> 06:37.146
And through peace,
we must find a different way forward.

06:37.147 --> 06:40.483
Colonel Ismat is the leader
of the Democratic faction,

06:40.484 --> 06:43.486
dedicated to freeing the Syrian people.

06:43.487 --> 06:46.906
And since Secretary Durant
is temporarily sidelined,

06:46.907 --> 06:50.076
I'm stepping in today
because the American government

06:50.077 --> 06:53.704
supports any concrete steps
toward stability.

06:53.705 --> 06:56.957
If it is determined
that chemical or biological weapons

06:56.958 --> 07:01.754
have been used in the Syrian conflict,
then from this moment forward,

07:01.755 --> 07:05.008
the United States will be morally
obligated to intervene.

07:05.592 --> 07:09.887
So, the Syrian president
should consider himself on notice.

07:10.973 --> 07:12.723
Mr. President, given the potential outcome

07:12.724 --> 07:14.892
that the House will affirm
articles of impeachment,

07:14.893 --> 07:17.979
is this the right time to wade
into a Middle Eastern conflict?

07:17.980 --> 07:20.648
Well, the question's off subject,
but I'll answer it.

07:21.942 --> 07:24.277
First of all, the vote is never gonna
get to the Senate.

07:24.278 --> 07:27.613
It's a senseless partisan circus.

07:27.614 --> 07:31.075
My focus is to remain doing my job,

07:31.076 --> 07:34.495
which is to ensure prosperity
for the American people,

07:34.496 --> 07:36.497
and to try to achieve...

07:36.498 --> 07:39.000
I'm sorry, how did you say it again?
Peace?

07:39.001 --> 07:41.335
<i>- Salam.
- Salam...</i>

07:41.336 --> 07:45.006
That's what we're trying to broker here.
<i>Salam.</i>

07:45.007 --> 07:48.801
So let's give the president time
to meet with Colonel Ismat.

07:48.802 --> 07:50.720
I'll take follow-up questions
in the press briefing room.

07:51.304 --> 07:54.807
Maybe I'm being too literal,
but that's the sea at night.

07:57.185 --> 08:00.147
- Do you like it?
- I prefer the reds.

08:01.189 --> 08:04.234
I... I saw a show of his
at the Tate Modern.

08:05.110 --> 08:08.571
I have trouble separating
the man from the art, though.

08:08.572 --> 08:11.699
He was, uh, depressive,
as I'm sure you know.

08:12.534 --> 08:15.828
You can see him fighting his demons.

08:17.955 --> 08:19.790
So Mr. Nasser has arrived?

08:19.791 --> 08:23.169
Uh, here and waiting for my call
at the Four Seasons.

08:23.170 --> 08:25.338
Well, I just...
I don't think it's a good idea

08:25.339 --> 08:30.093
for anyone in our administration
to be meeting with a member of ICO.

08:30.843 --> 08:34.389
- He's not a member.
- He went to school with Yusuf Al Ahmadi.

08:35.057 --> 08:38.101
He's a lawyer.
He represents people, organizations.

08:38.102 --> 08:41.312
- One organization, to be exact.
- And he's meeting with me.

08:41.313 --> 08:43.397
Where is all this hesitation
coming from?

08:43.398 --> 08:47.694
I'm sorry.
I just have a splitting headache.

08:50.947 --> 08:52.365
Gelsemium.

08:54.284 --> 08:57.370
For migraines. I get them all the time.
It comes out of China.

08:58.996 --> 09:00.832
But don't worry, it's herbal.

09:01.541 --> 09:05.711
You have to be careful of the dosing,
though. Just two drops.

09:05.712 --> 09:06.796
Hmm.

09:08.923 --> 09:11.134
You know, it's pure feeling for me.

09:11.926 --> 09:13.595
Light versus dark.

09:14.221 --> 09:16.264
And that line where they meet.

09:19.434 --> 09:21.018
The president had no idea.

09:21.019 --> 09:23.062
You were close to Mr. Macallan?

09:23.063 --> 09:26.065
Yes, but that doesn't mean
that I knew what he was up to.

09:26.066 --> 09:28.818
But then how do you know
the president wasn't involved?

09:29.486 --> 09:32.821
I was the last person to see Aidan.
He confessed to me.

09:32.822 --> 09:36.618
He secretly used the NSA, FISA,
to manipulate the electorate.

09:37.202 --> 09:39.912
We're meeting with counsel
to perfect the rest of the testimony.

09:39.913 --> 09:42.290
As long as no one has anything
that contradicts you.

09:42.874 --> 09:44.083
No one does.

09:44.084 --> 09:47.420
- Does it feel good to be back, LeAnn?
- It does. Thank you.

09:47.421 --> 09:49.963
Well, I know Claire is delighted
to have you back in her office.

09:49.964 --> 09:52.466
Will you let me know as soon
as the vice president's meeting is done?

09:52.467 --> 09:53.760
Yes, sir.

10:00.433 --> 10:03.060
I hate having her back. She's a liar.

10:03.853 --> 10:06.273
You think Macallan gave her something
for insurance?

10:07.064 --> 10:09.525
She won't admit it.
But, yeah, I think he did.

10:09.526 --> 10:11.777
Let's get her in front of that committee
when they're up.

10:11.778 --> 10:13.530
Then she'll have to make a choice.

10:14.531 --> 10:16.408
Green is hesitant to testify.

10:17.159 --> 10:19.785
You know, if I didn't know better,
I'd think he was the leak.

10:19.786 --> 10:22.330
He has far more information
than anyone should be comfortable with.

10:22.331 --> 10:24.791
Also, Senator Richardson
hasn't called me back.

10:26.793 --> 10:28.752
Colonel,
my apologies for the interruption.

10:30.797 --> 10:35.218
And I want to assure you
that your concerns are my concerns.

10:36.470 --> 10:38.221
The Ahmadi brothers...

10:38.222 --> 10:42.725
their idea of radical Islam
is unsustainable.

10:42.726 --> 10:47.188
Nasser represents members of ICO
who are tired of death.

10:47.189 --> 10:51.942
They essentially control numerous
oil fields and several refineries.

10:51.943 --> 10:54.945
Nasser already met
with the president of Syria.

10:54.946 --> 10:59.075
And Petrov's minister of foreign affairs.
He's looking for a deal.

10:59.826 --> 11:03.621
They wanna be a corporation trading
on the Dow before the decade is over.

11:03.622 --> 11:05.582
They wanna be a part of OPEC.

11:06.499 --> 11:10.002
So where does that leave Colonel Ismat
and the Syrian people?

11:10.003 --> 11:12.921
Alive... once we're on the ground.

11:12.922 --> 11:15.883
Yes, but Russia was invited in.
We need cause.

11:15.884 --> 11:21.347
The Syrian president has gassed civilians.
He will again. I can guarantee it.

11:21.348 --> 11:26.060
Colonel Ismat will make sure of it.
He'll instigate an attack from the regime.

11:29.314 --> 11:33.485
We put troops on the ground,
leave ICO resources alone...

11:34.110 --> 11:36.529
and Nasser will make sure they cooperate.

11:39.491 --> 11:40.700
What is it?

11:43.245 --> 11:44.953
Are you afraid he's gonna be impeached?

11:44.954 --> 11:47.874
'Cause there's a good chance
that he will be.

11:48.750 --> 11:53.087
Is that why you wanna wait?
'Cause... I can make it all wait.

11:55.673 --> 11:58.091
<i>Ms. Davis and I had
a very productive talk.</i>

11:58.092 --> 12:03.639
I let her know that our involvement
is contingent on the delivery of Ahmadi.

12:03.640 --> 12:07.560
Yes, but the window is closing for me
to be able to act on this.

12:07.561 --> 12:09.687
Judiciary's not gonna wait.

12:09.688 --> 12:12.731
For this to be effective,
it has to be now or never.

12:12.732 --> 12:15.067
<i>I'll have her reach out to Mr. Nasser.</i>

12:15.068 --> 12:17.986
And, uh, what about the other matter?

12:17.987 --> 12:20.573
<i>- You mean LeAnn?</i>
- Mmm-hmm.

12:20.574 --> 12:23.242
<i>Ms. Davis will speak to her
later this afternoon.</i>

12:25.870 --> 12:27.622
You heard the president.

12:39.050 --> 12:40.968
Uh,
I'm still at the White House.

12:41.719 --> 12:44.096
- Once we get into Syria...
- Sir, my name is Sean Jeffries.

12:44.097 --> 12:45.723
- I work with...
- Yes, I know who you are.

12:45.724 --> 12:46.724
Sean...

12:46.725 --> 12:48.559
I know what Tom Hammerschmidt
is working on.

12:48.560 --> 12:50.978
Mr. Jeffries, if you need an appointment,
I can arrange one...

12:50.979 --> 12:54.231
Sir, if I could.
Just a moment of your time.

12:56.443 --> 12:57.985
It's confidential.

13:07.662 --> 13:10.582
Oh, if you don't mind,
we'd like this room for a moment.

13:17.672 --> 13:20.674
You have 30 seconds.
But before you start,

13:20.675 --> 13:23.427
am I mistaken,
or is Mr. Grayson your superior?

13:23.428 --> 13:25.220
Yes, I'm sorry, but...

13:25.221 --> 13:27.681
Tom thinks Doug Stamper and yourself, sir,

13:27.682 --> 13:30.017
are somehow involved
with the death of Zoe Barnes.

13:30.018 --> 13:32.520
And Mr. Hammerschmidt has a phone
that was given to Ms. Barnes.

13:32.521 --> 13:35.523
It called only one number,
and that number was yours.

13:35.524 --> 13:38.651
Now, it seems that number has shown up
on the phone that she died with.

13:39.444 --> 13:42.112
It was damaged, but there's technology now

13:42.113 --> 13:45.073
that will give them access to the data
leading up to the day of her death.

13:45.074 --> 13:47.910
Its internal memory. Calls, texts.

13:48.786 --> 13:50.329
It's all there.

13:53.082 --> 13:54.917
When did you start with us?

13:55.585 --> 13:56.794
A week ago.

13:58.337 --> 14:00.589
And it was the vice president
who brought you on?

14:00.590 --> 14:01.924
That's correct.

14:03.885 --> 14:05.094
A week...

14:05.928 --> 14:10.767
and you're already having confidential
conversations with the president.

14:12.059 --> 14:13.060
I am.

14:14.937 --> 14:17.815
If you hear anything else,
you come directly to me.

14:19.233 --> 14:20.443
Yes, sir.

14:25.948 --> 14:28.826
Whatever you say it is,
it's perjury.

14:28.827 --> 14:30.412
Oh, perjury, huh?

14:31.162 --> 14:32.580
That's where you draw the line?

14:33.330 --> 14:34.457
I'm done.

14:35.332 --> 14:36.834
The case has already been prepared.

14:36.835 --> 14:40.546
TATP was found
on Muhammed Kalabi's computer.

14:40.547 --> 14:43.382
It doesn't matter what Secretary Durant
believes or not.

14:43.383 --> 14:46.176
One is speculation, and the other is fact.

14:46.177 --> 14:49.472
Fact? Really? Is that what it is?

14:49.473 --> 14:52.224
If it sounds like a fact,
then it is a fact.

14:52.225 --> 14:56.019
Kalabi had explosive residue
on his keyboard.

14:56.020 --> 14:58.856
You know the rest of the bureau is done
with the president.

14:58.857 --> 15:02.317
I'm not talking to them.
I'm talking to you.

15:02.318 --> 15:04.821
They've looked the other way,
but for how much longer?

15:05.405 --> 15:08.074
Doug... he's done.

15:09.534 --> 15:13.162
- Where does that leave me?
- That's what we're discussing right now.

15:14.539 --> 15:16.207
Do you know what the president thinks?

15:16.874 --> 15:18.543
He thinks you're the leak.

15:19.544 --> 15:20.920
I wish.

15:23.840 --> 15:26.383
I'm going to give you a moment
to take that statement back.

15:29.887 --> 15:32.890
I'll do what I have to do. I'll testify.

15:33.390 --> 15:34.976
But the president is done.

15:36.519 --> 15:39.105
He's losing support. You can smell it.

15:40.648 --> 15:42.567
Are you working for anyone else?

15:44.486 --> 15:47.071
- Are you working for anyone else?
- No.

15:48.405 --> 15:50.492
And I don't wanna know anything else.

15:51.283 --> 15:52.910
I'm tired of what I know.

15:57.499 --> 15:59.041
Consider me a proxy.

16:00.417 --> 16:03.378
- What?
- They don't wanna ask, but I will.

16:03.379 --> 16:06.632
You need to be fully committed,
which means being fully transparent,

16:06.633 --> 16:08.760
which means handing over what you have.

16:13.723 --> 16:15.182
Slow down, will you, please?

16:15.183 --> 16:17.226
I'd like to get home, Ms. Davis.

16:18.686 --> 16:21.313
LeAnn? LeAnn?

16:24.150 --> 16:28.530
Some nights, I go to a hotel to sleep,
just to get out of my apartment.

16:29.405 --> 16:32.658
Being a woman in this city,
the vigilance it takes...

16:32.659 --> 16:36.787
You're not allowed to make a mistake...
get distracted.

16:36.788 --> 16:38.872
It's a heavy price.

16:38.873 --> 16:42.292
To be on the edge that way
for years and years...

16:42.293 --> 16:44.587
My testimony won't disappoint.

16:45.254 --> 16:48.173
Well, the president and vice president
are pleased, I assume.

16:48.174 --> 16:52.511
But how long before the media starts
asking questions about Macallan's death,

16:52.512 --> 16:54.346
and how he was killed?

16:56.015 --> 16:57.684
I have your gun, by the way.

17:00.352 --> 17:02.939
- Good night.
- Yes, good night.

17:11.906 --> 17:13.240
Claire?

17:15.577 --> 17:17.829
- Yes?
- Claire?

17:22.040 --> 17:23.250
What's the matter?

17:24.126 --> 17:26.252
Hammerschmidt has a new theory.

17:27.378 --> 17:30.466
He thinks Doug Stamper and I
killed Zoe Barnes.

17:31.217 --> 17:34.470
They may have access to my cell phone,
to my texts.

17:37.223 --> 17:40.058
Someone in this White House is talking
to Hammerschmidt

17:40.059 --> 17:41.435
and now this.

17:45.272 --> 17:47.692
Oh, Doug.

17:51.362 --> 17:52.780
Poor Doug.

17:55.783 --> 17:57.034
Yes.

17:58.953 --> 18:01.080
He's an unlucky person.

18:02.582 --> 18:04.166
Always has been.

18:34.238 --> 18:37.867
- Sir, the senator's support is wavering.
<i>- Doug, it's Claire.</i>

18:39.535 --> 18:40.828
I'm sorry, I...

18:40.829 --> 18:44.832
<i>Francis and I were wondering if you could
come up to the residence tomorrow evening.</i>

18:44.833 --> 18:46.042
<i>For dinner.</i>

18:47.293 --> 18:52.214
<i>It'll give us a chance to take a breath
with all that's been happening.</i>

19:08.648 --> 19:10.023
Hello?

19:10.024 --> 19:11.608
<i>Happy birthday.</i>

19:13.569 --> 19:16.530
- Who is this?
<i>- Come on, you must know by now.</i>

19:17.114 --> 19:19.742
- No, I don't.
<i>- Aidan Macallan.</i>

19:19.743 --> 19:22.704
<i>Look into how he used and abused
the FISA ruling.</i>

19:23.537 --> 19:24.705
How do we know each other?

19:24.706 --> 19:28.041
<i>Now come on. If I told you that,
how can I possibly keep helping you?</i>

19:28.042 --> 19:29.960
<i>And don't you want me to help you?</i>

19:29.961 --> 19:33.546
But where do we meet?
Just give me that.

19:33.547 --> 19:35.340
<i>- In the muck.</i>
- Wait.

19:35.341 --> 19:39.469
<i>Zoe Barnes' death was not an accident.
Doug Stamper killed her.</i>

19:39.470 --> 19:41.013
<i>But you already know that.</i>

19:41.014 --> 19:43.515
No, don't hang up.
Don't hang up.

19:46.811 --> 19:50.689
<i>The Judiciary Committee may be hoping
Secretary Durant recovers.</i>

19:50.690 --> 19:52.941
<i>But the rest of the world is waiting
to see</i>

19:52.942 --> 19:58.405
<i>how the Syrian president responds
to President Underwood's line in the sand.</i>

19:58.406 --> 20:01.366
<i>Moscow, meanwhile,
calls the president's statements,</i>

20:01.367 --> 20:04.871
<i>"The desperate act of a man
on his way out of office."</i>

20:08.457 --> 20:10.793
Are you in contact with your brother?

20:13.212 --> 20:14.462
No.

20:14.463 --> 20:18.550
- Sundays. Occasional birthday.
- Hmm.

20:19.135 --> 20:21.720
I thought you were closer than that.

20:21.721 --> 20:24.681
No. We usually only speak
when one of us is in trouble.

20:26.350 --> 20:27.768
Well, that's why I ask,

20:27.769 --> 20:31.521
'cause in times like these,
we all need support.

20:31.522 --> 20:34.649
- Well, I'll have counsel.
- No, you'll have the best lawyers.

20:34.650 --> 20:36.819
The best of everything. The best.

20:39.781 --> 20:41.448
Would you like some more fish?

20:42.699 --> 20:44.368
No, thank you.

20:45.745 --> 20:48.205
Whatever the <i>Herald</i> has is circumstantial.

20:48.206 --> 20:49.497
Of course.

20:49.498 --> 20:53.294
No one knows what really happened to her,
and no one ever will.

20:55.504 --> 20:57.131
But, look, Doug...

20:57.882 --> 21:00.633
The reason that Claire
and I invited you over tonight

21:00.634 --> 21:04.972
is because we want you to know
how much you mean to us.

21:04.973 --> 21:06.098
To both of us.

21:07.558 --> 21:10.477
- Yes, sir.
- Before we say anything else,

21:10.478 --> 21:13.064
we just wanted to be
absolutely certain that...

21:14.648 --> 21:16.025
you knew that.

21:17.318 --> 21:18.945
Of course.

21:20.737 --> 21:22.906
What we're up against,

21:22.907 --> 21:27.244
what this administration is facing...
Well, what I'm facing...

21:27.245 --> 21:29.079
Even though both of us believe that

21:29.080 --> 21:33.084
there's very little chance
that I could ever be indicted, we still...

21:34.001 --> 21:38.046
have to find a way to remove
this entire issue from the table.

21:38.047 --> 21:41.800
I just can no longer
be associated with this.

21:41.801 --> 21:44.636
I'll resign while I'm dealing with this.

21:48.349 --> 21:51.310
I think this is going to require
more than that.

21:52.019 --> 21:54.855
Well, I'll make a statement...

21:54.856 --> 21:57.399
and blame it on the politics
of personal destruction.

21:57.400 --> 22:01.112
No, Doug, I'm afraid that's just
not going to be enough.

22:02.404 --> 22:06.742
We have to shift... the suspicion.

22:08.785 --> 22:09.995
We need you to...

22:09.996 --> 22:13.790
We need you to implicate yourself
in the death of Zoe Barnes.

22:13.791 --> 22:16.043
Now, before you react, just listen.

22:16.044 --> 22:17.794
You are the most likely candidate
at this point.

22:17.795 --> 22:19.462
You were distraught, you were drinking.

22:19.463 --> 22:20.797
The... I don't know.

22:20.798 --> 22:22.883
We'll make up some story,
and then we'll leak it.

22:22.884 --> 22:24.759
You... you were loyal, you did it for me.

22:24.760 --> 22:27.930
You were too loyal. You went too far.

22:27.931 --> 22:31.099
And... and then, in the end,
there'll be no question...

22:31.100 --> 22:32.851
Can you excuse me?

23:32.494 --> 23:35.788
Well, it's either a crank looking
for a headline,

23:35.789 --> 23:38.083
or someone on the inside
telling the truth.

23:38.084 --> 23:41.128
- What's your sense?
- He knew about the birthday cards.

23:41.129 --> 23:42.463
I don't know.

23:43.172 --> 23:47.050
Maybe the story is the call.
The flash drives. The leaks themselves.

23:47.051 --> 23:49.802
If we call out the leaks,
he may stop contacting me.

23:49.803 --> 23:52.680
And the Macallan business,
is that even a real lead?

23:52.681 --> 23:54.474
None of these sites will admit
to anything.

23:54.475 --> 23:56.226
Because it's an embarrassment.

23:56.227 --> 23:58.561
An overwhelming amount
of Underwood material

23:58.562 --> 24:03.025
was reported by social media users
in counties that he was expected to lose.

24:03.026 --> 24:06.569
But anyone I reach out to
does not wanna be talking about this.

24:06.570 --> 24:09.281
The leak said it was unauthorized
domestic surveillance.

24:09.282 --> 24:12.492
All the administration has to say is
"terror," and they seem justified.

24:12.493 --> 24:15.328
He wasn't rooting out terrorists.

24:15.329 --> 24:16.913
He was trying to win an election.

24:16.914 --> 24:19.749
And very convenient that
the Secretary of State hits her head.

24:19.750 --> 24:23.586
- Now you sound like a conspiracy...
- I'm not a conspiracy theorist.

24:23.587 --> 24:26.214
I try to imagine what it's like
inside his mind,

24:26.215 --> 24:28.216
what I would do if I were him.

24:28.217 --> 24:31.720
And I'm telling you, it is all sorts of...

24:33.722 --> 24:37.934
He has no ideology. No North Star.

24:37.935 --> 24:40.645
Isn't that the scariest thing of all?

24:40.646 --> 24:43.732
Tom, do you think Zoe Barnes was murdered?

24:44.316 --> 24:47.152
How often does a 27-year-old fall
in front of a train?

24:47.153 --> 24:50.572
- All right, then. Let's prove that.
- All right.

24:59.956 --> 25:01.042
What's wrong?

25:01.625 --> 25:04.419
Doug Stamper's office called.
They wanna set up a meeting.

25:04.420 --> 25:05.629
Soon as possible.

25:07.589 --> 25:09.007
This is good.

25:09.883 --> 25:13.886
Whatever your boyfriend read
off your phone this morning

25:13.887 --> 25:15.306
made its way to the right person.

25:16.432 --> 25:18.600
I don't know how much longer
I can do this.

25:20.144 --> 25:23.105
You're lying to a liar.

25:23.689 --> 25:26.274
You can't get anything
off the phone Zoe died with.

25:26.275 --> 25:28.235
They just need to believe we can.

25:29.320 --> 25:30.696
What is this job?

25:34.325 --> 25:35.992
Not what it used to be.

25:43.917 --> 25:45.836
I don't want you to overreact.

25:46.420 --> 25:51.007
But Tom kept writing.
It seems he finally finished his book.

25:52.176 --> 25:53.552
And he alludes to things.

25:54.720 --> 25:56.554
What do you mean "alludes to things"?

25:56.555 --> 25:59.098
I don't know. Lines are blacked out.
It's like it's redacted.

25:59.099 --> 26:01.059
There are paragraphs here and there...

26:01.935 --> 26:03.479
What did you tell him?

26:05.147 --> 26:06.731
What does he know?

26:06.732 --> 26:08.608
Has he shown this to anyone?
Sent it to anyone?

26:08.609 --> 26:10.277
- Publishers, the press?
- I don't know.

26:10.278 --> 26:12.070
Well, what do you know?

26:13.155 --> 26:15.865
I will handle him.
I just wanted you to be aware.

26:15.866 --> 26:18.618
- Son of a bitch.
- I said I'll take care of it.

26:18.619 --> 26:21.872
No, I'll take care of it.
You stay a million miles away from this.

26:30.172 --> 26:32.258
How could you be so stupid...

26:34.718 --> 26:36.387
to fall in love?

26:38.263 --> 26:40.890
<i>This thing isn't on the floor yet,
and we're losing senators.</i>

26:40.891 --> 26:42.643
We're losing some maybe, but...

26:43.602 --> 26:46.062
<i>What I like about the Senate
is what I hate.</i>

26:46.563 --> 26:47.855
It's contagious.

26:47.856 --> 26:51.025
One of 'em gets an idea, and it spreads
through the body like a flu.

26:51.026 --> 26:52.402
<i>I'll look into it.</i>

26:52.403 --> 26:54.655
<i>There's 100 of 'em.
All we need is half.</i>

26:56.823 --> 26:58.825
Can I just lay down?

26:58.826 --> 27:01.119
- I don't think that's a good idea.
- Just for a few minutes.

27:01.120 --> 27:04.665
I'm just so fucking tired,
and I need to think.

27:06.250 --> 27:08.084
Why do you need to think?

27:11.463 --> 27:13.340
The longer you hang on
to whatever he gave you,

27:13.341 --> 27:15.217
the more danger you're in.

27:15.218 --> 27:17.344
You're reading this wrong.

27:17.345 --> 27:20.013
You think it's some kind of insurance,
but it's not.

27:21.723 --> 27:22.765
LeAnn...

27:22.766 --> 27:27.312
Whatever happens to the president,
it's not your fault, or mine.

27:27.313 --> 27:30.357
- You don't think I make a difference?
- I didn't say that.

27:33.569 --> 27:36.446
You... you don't think
that I'm dedicated enough?

27:36.447 --> 27:37.947
Too dedicated.

27:37.948 --> 27:41.075
That can be a problem.
That can make you blind.

27:41.076 --> 27:42.536
You have no idea...

27:49.501 --> 27:52.338
I've done something unforgivable, LeAnn.

27:58.009 --> 27:59.010
What?

28:01.847 --> 28:03.765
I killed Zoe Barnes.

28:04.350 --> 28:06.184
Why would you say that?

28:17.446 --> 28:20.073
All I ever tried to do was keep her safe.

28:21.992 --> 28:24.328
She said she wanted to be invisible.

28:25.704 --> 28:27.706
I knew it wasn't possible.

28:31.377 --> 28:36.298
I knew that she would only ever go away...
if I made sure of it.

28:40.927 --> 28:42.429
I don't believe you.

28:43.096 --> 28:44.306
Yes, you do.

28:47.851 --> 28:51.062
Believe me... I deserve this.

28:51.063 --> 28:54.607
Zoe Barnes fell in front of a train.
It was ruled an accident.

28:54.608 --> 28:57.361
I pushed her off the platform
and I walked away.

29:20.091 --> 29:23.053
I know you reached out to Bridget Cohen.

29:25.180 --> 29:28.391
Telling that committee or her
how I got my liver

29:28.392 --> 29:32.521
is not going to help this administration
or you.

29:33.814 --> 29:36.275
But here is what is going to help.

29:37.318 --> 29:41.947
This is what you're going to tell
that committee about Doug Stamper.

29:44.741 --> 29:46.659
You actually live here?

29:46.660 --> 29:49.830
Well... I'm not here that much.

29:50.497 --> 29:52.207
I let friends use it now and again.

29:53.041 --> 29:55.251
- Thanks for your discretion.
- Of course.

29:55.252 --> 29:56.712
I won't be too long.

29:57.296 --> 30:00.215
Take your time.
If you need anything, I'll be on call.

30:02.092 --> 30:03.552
He's reasonable.

30:04.636 --> 30:06.388
Yeah, he needs to be.

30:06.389 --> 30:08.014
Uh, they didn't look that hard.

30:08.015 --> 30:10.808
The Secret Service knows
I have nothing to hide.

30:10.809 --> 30:12.478
He's downstairs.

30:14.771 --> 30:16.231
Make yourself at home.

30:34.375 --> 30:36.502
I used to love to hide as a kid.

30:37.503 --> 30:39.463
I was really good at it.

30:40.839 --> 30:43.133
I could always choose the best places.

30:44.926 --> 30:46.678
Nobody ever found me.

30:50.098 --> 30:52.684
One time, everybody just gave up.

30:53.852 --> 30:57.356
So I stayed put for, like,
13 hours straight.

31:00.817 --> 31:02.152
What do you want?

31:05.364 --> 31:08.825
He said I wouldn't regret it...
if I said yes.

31:11.161 --> 31:12.245
Francis.

31:12.788 --> 31:16.999
When I agreed to write the book
about his origin story way back when.

31:17.000 --> 31:18.251
Hmm.

31:19.127 --> 31:21.505
Well, he regrets asking you now.

31:22.255 --> 31:24.215
I said yes 'cause
I have always been a sucker

31:24.216 --> 31:27.635
for what people tell themselves
about themselves.

31:27.636 --> 31:29.471
Who has the manuscript?

31:33.016 --> 31:34.184
You do.

31:35.519 --> 31:36.978
And publishers?

31:38.104 --> 31:40.607
Not yet.

31:42.401 --> 31:44.277
So what did you think?

31:46.196 --> 31:48.573
There are huge sections blacked out, Tom.

31:48.574 --> 31:51.410
You portrayed us
like a couple of monsters.

31:52.578 --> 31:55.246
- I never used that word.
- You didn't have to.

32:01.420 --> 32:04.839
On the flight back from Moscow,
not long after we met...

32:06.258 --> 32:08.719
You and Francis had a fight.

32:09.511 --> 32:11.178
A real knock down.

32:11.179 --> 32:14.015
I told Francis I heard the yelling,
but not the words.

32:14.808 --> 32:15.976
But...

32:19.395 --> 32:21.272
you said you were murderers.

32:22.733 --> 32:24.568
He said you were survivors.

32:28.905 --> 32:30.741
I was dreading coming here.

32:31.742 --> 32:34.536
- Why?
- You can't publish it, Tom.

32:36.497 --> 32:38.205
I'd rather not.

32:38.206 --> 32:40.166
So, what? Money?

32:41.710 --> 32:44.838
Yeah... but enough.

32:45.672 --> 32:48.550
Enough so I can really get lost
for a while.

32:48.551 --> 32:51.887
Buy some time till I figure out
what I'm gonna do next.

32:53.680 --> 32:55.766
We can figure something out.

32:57.183 --> 32:58.351
I bet.

33:02.313 --> 33:05.150
You know, those parts
you blacked out, that's...

33:06.276 --> 33:09.571
- I've never told anyone but you.
- I know.

33:11.239 --> 33:12.699
I know everything.

33:14.743 --> 33:16.787
But isn't that what you wanted?

33:21.542 --> 33:23.126
I miss touching you.

33:24.961 --> 33:27.589
I don't know how to not be around you.

33:28.840 --> 33:33.011
I think of you all the time.
It almost makes me hate you for it.

33:46.107 --> 33:48.735
I don't know what to do.

33:53.740 --> 33:56.577
You're so beautiful.

33:57.786 --> 34:00.622
- Keep going.
- Not just beautiful, beautiful.

34:01.206 --> 34:03.041
There's lots of people like that.

34:08.254 --> 34:12.507
You are radiant, Claire.
And good. You are so good.

34:12.509 --> 34:15.303
- I'm not good.
- Yes, you are.

34:21.016 --> 34:23.728
- Why won't you kiss me?
- I wanna look at you.

34:29.775 --> 34:32.527
I really do wanna go to Greenland one day.

34:33.196 --> 34:35.406
- We should go.
- Don't stop.

34:36.617 --> 34:40.829
It's so frozen and remote.

34:43.039 --> 34:44.415
The way the...

34:44.416 --> 34:48.168
The way the...
Smells before it...

34:49.462 --> 34:52.047
The... You know what I mean?

35:00.599 --> 35:02.142
Help. Help.

35:17.866 --> 35:19.117
Tom?

35:47.103 --> 35:49.939
There are close to half a million dead.

35:49.940 --> 35:51.607
Over four million refugees,

35:51.608 --> 35:55.153
women and children who have left
the region and require care.

35:56.112 --> 35:59.323
At least 12 million displaced people.

35:59.324 --> 36:02.827
Homeless wanderers
who no longer belong anywhere.

36:02.828 --> 36:04.787
We are all students of history.

36:04.788 --> 36:08.374
Syria was one of the founding members
of the United Nations, for God's sakes.

36:08.375 --> 36:12.754
How did we get here? We, who sprang from
one of the most ancient civilizations?

36:12.755 --> 36:16.215
At some point, we must accept peace
as the only answer.

36:16.216 --> 36:20.553
All parties must lay down their arms
and begin to talk.

37:27.203 --> 37:28.371
Okay.

37:31.707 --> 37:34.001
You were always good at tracking me down.

37:34.002 --> 37:35.544
It wasn't easy.

37:35.545 --> 37:39.006
Movie theater,
the occasional classified meeting.

37:39.007 --> 37:40.842
I know what you're doing.

37:41.760 --> 37:43.510
Well, that's a bit vague.

37:43.511 --> 37:46.388
You're sabotaging him.
Peeling off senators.

37:46.389 --> 37:48.182
I know it's you.

37:48.183 --> 37:50.309
You were much more interesting
when you smoked.

37:50.310 --> 37:51.769
No, I wasn't.

37:51.770 --> 37:54.981
The money's not with him, Mark.

37:54.982 --> 37:58.401
The... the Koch brother types,
Wall Street, oil and gas...

37:59.152 --> 38:01.028
Even labor's walking out on him.

38:01.029 --> 38:05.241
He's more resourceful than you think.
He's done a lot without money, okay?

38:05.242 --> 38:08.202
I want you to back off,
let me handle these hearings.

38:08.203 --> 38:10.329
I just got to the White House.
I intend to stick around.

38:10.330 --> 38:12.457
I don't want him to be president.

38:18.421 --> 38:20.506
- The country needs a change.
- Okay, so...

38:20.507 --> 38:22.424
And they don't need to look
any further than his wife.

38:22.425 --> 38:26.637
She's tough, smart.
He's smart, too, but he's not reliable.

38:26.638 --> 38:30.391
Her? You can work with her.
I know you see it, too.

38:30.392 --> 38:34.311
I see a partner when it comes to Syria,
or what's left of it.

38:34.312 --> 38:35.521
Let me try one of those.

38:36.564 --> 38:40.442
I mean, far be it from us to tell
an ancient civilization its business...

38:40.443 --> 38:45.781
but Syria is now basically unrivaled
as the most violent place on the planet.

38:45.782 --> 38:47.242
I know, I know.

38:49.160 --> 38:52.872
I'm not saying what to do
with Frank Underwood

38:52.873 --> 38:56.125
is not gonna be a difficult problem.

38:56.126 --> 39:00.588
But... if we don't establish
a presence in the region...

39:02.132 --> 39:03.549
it's gonna be too late.

39:06.887 --> 39:09.222
- I'd rather have a cigarette.
- Spit it out.

39:10.098 --> 39:13.226
Well... let me buy you dinner
or something.

39:14.560 --> 39:17.022
What? What happened? What's the matter?

39:21.109 --> 39:23.862
I had that child in my arms.

39:26.322 --> 39:29.241
I could feel her breath on me,
but I couldn't look down.

39:33.496 --> 39:34.622
Excuse me.

39:36.416 --> 39:37.417
Yeah?

39:38.668 --> 39:40.378
Uh, 20 minutes away.

39:42.047 --> 39:45.175
- Okay. I have to go. I'm sorry.
- Do, please.

39:52.974 --> 39:54.725
I'm tired. I'm going to bed.

40:03.484 --> 40:04.986
I need your services.

40:06.737 --> 40:07.738
Jesus.

40:08.531 --> 40:09.532
No.

40:10.116 --> 40:11.117
Now.

40:13.328 --> 40:16.497
I believe Doug Stamper killed Zoe Barnes.

40:16.498 --> 40:18.415
I believe he was unstable

40:18.416 --> 40:20.376
and killed her
to benefit Francis Underwood.

40:20.377 --> 40:22.586
Stop. Stop it, please?
Uh, off the record.

40:22.587 --> 40:25.298
Can you give us a second?
I'll call you back in.

40:30.595 --> 40:34.181
Seth, this has nothing to do
with pay for play, or Kalabi,

40:34.182 --> 40:36.392
or anything else
the president is accused of.

40:36.977 --> 40:40.563
- Where are you getting this?
- This is what I know about Doug.

40:41.314 --> 40:44.483
The chair will not let you testify
in front of the committee with this.

40:44.484 --> 40:47.819
- This is what I have.
- Can you prove any of it?

40:47.820 --> 40:49.655
He's implied that he did it.

40:49.656 --> 40:53.284
I can speak to his behavior.
Things that he's done.

40:54.785 --> 40:56.704
You need to go to the US attorney.

40:59.540 --> 41:02.961
Seth, if you don't, I will.

41:04.504 --> 41:06.964
"I told the president there were
four men by the same name

41:06.965 --> 41:10.092
the State Department was tracking.
Two in the United States."

41:10.093 --> 41:13.679
So said a senior White House source,
as quoted in the <i>Washington Herald.</i>

41:14.347 --> 41:16.099
Were you aware of this conversation?

41:16.933 --> 41:18.559
No, sir, I was not.

41:19.143 --> 41:22.062
The source went on.
"I believe the president understood

41:22.063 --> 41:26.233
that the Muhammed Kalabi in Tennessee
was not a legitimate threat."

41:26.234 --> 41:28.360
Was this conveyed to you in any way?

41:28.361 --> 41:30.155
Again, no, sir.

41:32.907 --> 41:34.200
Still, the committee's looking forward to

41:34.201 --> 41:36.076
Secretary Durant's testimony
on this matter.

41:36.077 --> 41:39.747
I have no idea what the secretary
will say or not say, but I...

41:39.748 --> 41:42.291
have great respect for her
and wish her a speedy recovery.

41:42.875 --> 41:47.880
We were operating off of facts and reports
coming in at an accelerated rate that day.

41:50.966 --> 41:52.302
I'll try this again.

41:53.469 --> 41:56.388
Did the president indicate to you
at any time

41:56.389 --> 41:58.390
that he knew this was not a threat?

41:58.391 --> 42:02.228
No. And I'd like to point out
that I'm proud to be representing

42:02.229 --> 42:04.313
the men and women of the FBI here today,

42:04.314 --> 42:07.441
who conducted that investigation
as they always do

42:07.442 --> 42:09.985
in a competent, honest,
and independent way,

42:09.986 --> 42:12.238
in the finest tradition of the FBI.

42:12.239 --> 42:14.657
- Did they?
- Our people did their job.

42:15.325 --> 42:20.454
And it's unthinkable to assume the FBI
would involve itself in an election.

42:20.455 --> 42:23.040
Because there may be an innocent man
sitting in a cell as we speak.

42:23.041 --> 42:26.627
I can comment on this
since it was mentioned in the press.

42:26.628 --> 42:31.673
Trace amounts of an explosive material
were found on Mr. Kalabi's computer.

42:33.468 --> 42:35.677
Your assertion is
that the president was unaware

42:35.678 --> 42:37.388
of what was happening
in his own White House?

42:37.972 --> 42:39.931
Aidan Macallan was an NSA employee,

42:39.932 --> 42:43.852
so, no, the president had no idea
what he was up to.

42:43.853 --> 42:46.522
Honestly, he was quite busy campaigning.

42:46.523 --> 42:50.776
But surely he knew the effects
of Mr. Macallan's work? These exploits?

42:50.777 --> 42:52.068
No.

42:52.069 --> 42:54.905
The president and...
I've been with him out on the stump.

42:54.906 --> 42:58.992
He likes to shake hands.
He's not paying attention to social media.

42:58.993 --> 43:01.870
Ms. Harvey,
there was a FISA ruling issued,

43:01.871 --> 43:05.249
which the Underwood administration used
to spy on American citizens

43:05.250 --> 43:06.750
for the sake of swaying an election.

43:06.751 --> 43:10.837
Congressman Romero,
Aidan Macallan was a troubled person.

43:10.838 --> 43:14.675
His mind worked fast,
faster than I think anyone's should.

43:14.676 --> 43:17.136
What he was up to
went to the grave with him.

43:17.137 --> 43:19.180
Ms. Harvey, please,
spare me the semantics...

43:19.181 --> 43:20.347
- Okay, fine.
- I just need you...

43:20.348 --> 43:25.561
Was he collecting data? Yes.
Did he cross a line? Most likely.

43:26.187 --> 43:28.272
I did visit with him,
checking in on his work.

43:28.273 --> 43:31.775
Have you seen a screen of code?
Computer code.

43:31.776 --> 43:33.319
It's indecipherable.

43:35.322 --> 43:37.406
Why did Seth Grayson end up
not testifying?

43:37.407 --> 43:38.490
No comment.

43:38.491 --> 43:41.618
We heard that his testimony had to do
with the president's chief of staff.

43:41.619 --> 43:44.455
Who I would welcome testifying
in front of our committee.

43:44.456 --> 43:47.541
I urge Doug Stamper
and the rest of the administration

43:47.542 --> 43:49.960
to stop hiding behind executive privilege.

43:50.628 --> 43:52.713
<i>All we learned so far
is that the president knew nothing</i>

43:52.714 --> 43:55.258
<i>about anything going on
in his White House.</i>

43:58.178 --> 44:01.222
There were six of them,
and they all took a turn.

44:02.182 --> 44:03.515
Except for Romero.

44:03.516 --> 44:05.226
He only watched.

44:05.227 --> 44:07.812
Or... at least
that's what he told the dean.

44:09.189 --> 44:10.815
But I know the real story.

44:11.441 --> 44:13.568
Her name was, uh, Rochelle.

44:14.194 --> 44:16.903
I thought you had nothing on this guy.
How long have you known this?

44:16.904 --> 44:19.198
I was holding it until...
Or, if we needed it.

44:19.199 --> 44:21.200
No, until you needed it, you mean.

44:21.201 --> 44:23.494
Look, it makes no difference.
I might use it, I might not.

44:23.495 --> 44:24.745
But I still wanna testify.

44:24.746 --> 44:27.539
For you to testify now,
excuse me for saying it, it's crazy.

44:27.540 --> 44:29.208
Do you think it's crazy, Claire?

44:29.209 --> 44:32.378
- I wanna defend myself against this guy.
- We have witnesses.

44:32.379 --> 44:34.630
Our witnesses, surrogates.
Let it come from them.

44:34.631 --> 44:36.089
I think I can win.

44:36.090 --> 44:37.591
Or maybe I should wait
until I lose the Senate...

44:37.592 --> 44:38.717
I just think there are other ways...

44:38.718 --> 44:43.598
If you give up executive privilege,
we lose leverage. We lose it all.

44:45.350 --> 44:47.142
Tell the chair I'm ready to appear.

44:49.687 --> 44:54.149
I mean, the damage your testimony could do
to your wife is not worth the risk.

44:54.150 --> 44:56.736
Oh, its worth is what
we're here to discuss.

44:57.362 --> 45:01.198
I... I don't appreciate being the one
to tell you this, but...

45:01.991 --> 45:05.202
your presidency is beyond repair.

45:07.413 --> 45:09.331
You don't know what I'm going to do next.

45:09.332 --> 45:12.459
Isn't that it?
Isn't that what really bothers you?

45:12.460 --> 45:15.921
Don't think I haven't been watching you
from the moment you stepped on board.

45:16.506 --> 45:19.049
You're full of promises, Ms. Davis.

45:19.050 --> 45:21.302
The information about Macallan
is still out there

45:21.303 --> 45:24.264
and Ahmadi is, oh, so elusive.

45:25.556 --> 45:29.685
You've been sabotaging me from the moment
you stepped into my house.

45:31.604 --> 45:33.856
You don't care for me very much, do you?

45:34.815 --> 45:36.484
No, I don't.

45:37.318 --> 45:39.153
I couldn't care less.

45:40.070 --> 45:42.656
But if you make Claire happy,
that makes me happy.

45:42.657 --> 45:46.577
- If you can help her, good.
- What's it worth to you?

45:48.162 --> 45:49.871
Well, what kind of deal
are we talking about?

45:49.872 --> 45:51.164
For me not to testify.

45:51.165 --> 45:53.166
Well, I have contacts outside the Beltway.

45:53.167 --> 45:55.711
I can set you up in any number
of lucrative positions.

45:55.712 --> 45:58.631
No, that's not good enough.
Anyone could offer me that.

46:00.174 --> 46:01.383
You tell me.

46:01.384 --> 46:03.719
No, no, no.
It's not going to work like that.

46:03.720 --> 46:07.598
- You tell me what you can do for me.
- I've been around your kind.

46:08.223 --> 46:11.727
Not usually at this level.
But you can't help yourself.

46:15.147 --> 46:17.274
Make me an offer, Ms. Davis.

46:19.735 --> 46:22.363
What is she worth to you?

46:24.449 --> 46:25.700
A lot.

46:30.455 --> 46:32.498
So then here's what I'm thinking.

46:34.291 --> 46:35.667
Do you solemnly swear
and affirm

46:35.668 --> 46:37.503
that the testimony you are
about to give is the truth,

46:37.504 --> 46:39.129
the whole truth,
and nothing but the truth?

46:39.130 --> 46:40.589
I do.

46:40.590 --> 46:44.259
Let the record reflect that the witness
has answered in the affirmative.

46:45.720 --> 46:47.722
Mr. President,
I want to thank you for appearing...

46:48.305 --> 46:51.057
and I hope we get to clear some
things up for the American people.

46:51.058 --> 46:52.934
Mr. President, the floor is yours.

46:52.935 --> 46:54.811
You can take as long
or as short as you like.

46:54.812 --> 46:57.063
If you have any written statement,

46:57.064 --> 47:00.025
we will include it after
and it will be part of the record.

47:01.026 --> 47:04.405
- Mr. President, you are recognized.
- Thank you, Mr. Chairman...

47:04.947 --> 47:07.575
and to the other members
of this committee.

47:08.493 --> 47:12.078
I have agreed to appear
before this committee today...

47:12.079 --> 47:13.623
because...

47:14.457 --> 47:15.833
I'm guilty.

47:22.256 --> 47:27.553
Guilty of having spent
the last 30 years of my life here...

47:28.178 --> 47:29.680
in this Congress.

47:30.305 --> 47:32.265
In this House.

47:32.266 --> 47:35.226
Then as vice president
and now as president,

47:35.227 --> 47:37.772
trying to do the people's work.

47:38.481 --> 47:42.317
Now, this committee has accused me
of a great number of things.

47:42.318 --> 47:46.321
You accused me of pay to play.

47:46.322 --> 47:51.117
And so I accuse you of exactly the same.

47:51.118 --> 47:55.456
I also accuse you of playing politics
only when it suits you.

47:57.291 --> 47:59.209
You're all being paid.

47:59.210 --> 48:01.878
You're all serving some master.

48:01.879 --> 48:07.133
Each and every one of you,
and you know I know that for a fact.

48:07.134 --> 48:10.345
You, for example, Congressman Romero...

48:10.971 --> 48:15.392
and your crusade to take me down,
is it for justice?

48:15.393 --> 48:17.352
For the good of the nation?

48:17.353 --> 48:21.398
Is the truth
what you're really after?

48:21.399 --> 48:24.234
Or is it for some personal gain?

48:24.235 --> 48:29.698
Perhaps to try to fill
the small hole in your soul

48:29.699 --> 48:33.327
that you sold off a long time ago?

48:33.911 --> 48:36.329
- Mr. President.
- No, no, no.

48:36.330 --> 48:40.542
This is my opening statement,
and I will give it in full.

48:40.543 --> 48:43.754
I am not done, ladies and gentlemen.

48:45.590 --> 48:48.466
You accuse me of breaking the rules,

48:48.467 --> 48:52.679
and I tell you, I am playing by the rules.

48:52.680 --> 48:57.559
The very rules
that you and I all agreed upon.

48:57.560 --> 49:03.440
The very rules
that you and I all wrote together.

49:04.108 --> 49:07.611
So, yes, I'm guilty as hell,
but then so are all of you.

49:07.612 --> 49:09.696
Yes, the system is corrupt,

49:09.697 --> 49:12.991
but you wanted a guardian
at the gate like me.

49:12.992 --> 49:18.748
And why? Because you know
I will do whatever it takes.

49:19.248 --> 49:22.918
And you have all enjoyed it,

49:22.919 --> 49:26.839
been party to it and benefited by it.

49:27.798 --> 49:30.050
Oh, don't deny it. You've loved it.

49:30.051 --> 49:32.427
You don't actually need me
to stand for anything.

49:32.428 --> 49:34.304
You just need me to stand.

49:34.972 --> 49:38.183
To be the strong man. The man of action.

49:38.809 --> 49:43.104
My God,
you're addicted to action and slogans.

49:43.105 --> 49:46.316
It doesn't matter what I say.
It doesn't matter what I do.

49:46.317 --> 49:51.279
Just as long as I'm doing something,
you're happy to be along for the ride.

49:51.280 --> 49:53.949
And frankly, I don't blame you.

49:53.950 --> 49:58.453
With all the foolishness and indecision
in your lives, why not a man like me?

49:58.954 --> 50:00.497
I don't apologize.

50:01.331 --> 50:04.542
In the end, I don't care
whether you love me or you hate me,

50:04.543 --> 50:06.546
just as long as I win.

50:07.129 --> 50:10.174
The deck is stacked. The rules are rigged.

50:14.469 --> 50:17.848
Welcome to the death of the Age of Reason.

50:19.141 --> 50:23.437
There is no right or wrong. Not anymore.

50:24.229 --> 50:26.273
There's only being in...

50:27.608 --> 50:29.694
and then being out.

50:33.447 --> 50:36.324
So I will not be party to this any longer.

50:36.325 --> 50:40.704
I will not wear the target
for any of you anymore.

50:40.705 --> 50:44.833
You have all used me far long enough.

50:44.834 --> 50:47.669
So, the party's over, the ride's done.

50:47.670 --> 50:51.297
I respect the office too much
to allow this to continue going on.

50:51.298 --> 50:54.676
That's why I am announcing
to this committee and to the nation

50:54.677 --> 50:56.928
that as of 6:00 p.m. tomorrow evening,

50:56.929 --> 51:00.390
I shall resign the office
of President of the United States.

51:00.391 --> 51:03.018
Order!

51:03.894 --> 51:08.148
And I will be happy to take
any questions you may have.

51:08.149 --> 51:11.944
But my gut tells me
that isn't really going to be necessary.
