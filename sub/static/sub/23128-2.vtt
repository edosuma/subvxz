WEBVTT

00:02.100 --> 00:04.467
- Previously on Being Human...

00:04.700 --> 00:07.635
- Now, Josh! It's the only way
to cure both of us!

00:07.670 --> 00:09.502
(All grunting)

00:11.070 --> 00:13.107
What if it didn't cure us?

00:13.140 --> 00:14.574
- Nora?

00:14.610 --> 00:16.146
(Growling)

00:16.180 --> 00:18.046
We're bringing Sally back.
- As what?

00:18.080 --> 00:19.548
- As Sally.

00:19.580 --> 00:21.810
- Blood magic.
For your friend's body.

00:21.850 --> 00:24.842
- You two are going
through that door.

00:27.220 --> 00:28.756
(Wheezing)

00:30.490 --> 00:33.221
- They're all dead.
A human virus.

00:33.260 --> 00:36.969
Any of our brothers who fed
from a tainted human, this...

00:37.000 --> 00:39.264
(Rustling)

00:42.540 --> 00:44.963
- (Josh):
He's dying.

00:47.940 --> 00:49.772
(Bird chirping)

00:59.260 --> 01:00.682
(Screams)

01:00.720 --> 01:02.256
(Hissing)

01:04.790 --> 01:05.552
(Fangs click)

01:05.590 --> 01:07.854
- Tell me where my son is...

01:08.930 --> 01:12.264
and I'll let you rot from
your stinking disease.

01:12.300 --> 01:13.961
(Hissing)

01:14.000 --> 01:17.709
Tell me about my son!

01:23.280 --> 01:25.601
(Gunshot)

01:28.420 --> 01:30.684
(Roaring)

01:58.280 --> 02:01.079
(Roaring)

02:05.220 --> 02:08.610
I'll find who did this to you.

02:14.430 --> 02:18.526
I'll kill his sons
and daughters.

02:19.540 --> 02:21.634
Everyone he loves.

02:21.670 --> 02:24.401
Make them beg me to end them.

02:25.870 --> 02:29.750
And if any harm has come
to your sister,

02:31.850 --> 02:36.811
when I finish,
it will rain blood and ashes.

02:38.620 --> 02:40.657
Then the leeches will know:

02:40.690 --> 02:43.625
see a purebred and run.

02:44.490 --> 02:47.892
(Groaning)

02:59.610 --> 03:01.009
(Wheezing)

03:02.010 --> 03:04.069
(Grunting)

03:36.380 --> 03:38.508
- This is supremely weird.

03:38.550 --> 03:40.473
You were all dead,
like, 10 minutes ago.

03:40.520 --> 03:42.614
- You should get a room,
"cause now you can.

03:42.650 --> 03:44.539
- Sorry, I just
keep thinking

03:44.590 --> 03:46.786
I'm gonna wake up
in an insane asylum.

03:46.820 --> 03:49.790
This isn't possible.
You can't bring back the dead.

03:49.830 --> 03:51.821
- And yet we brought
back three of them,

03:51.860 --> 03:54.500
two of whom are now
wearing my clothes.

03:57.000 --> 04:00.038
- Thank you for
getting my life back.

04:00.070 --> 04:01.629
- Oh!

04:03.010 --> 04:06.105
Now, be good to Zoe
or I'll break your face.

04:06.140 --> 04:08.108
- I will.

04:08.140 --> 04:10.108
Guys?

04:10.150 --> 04:11.242
- (Josh):
Bye, Nick.

04:11.280 --> 04:14.170
- Bye, Zoe.
- Bye, Zoe.

04:14.220 --> 04:15.574
Enjoy!

04:15.620 --> 04:16.882
- I'm gonna hit it too.

04:16.920 --> 04:19.116
- Hit it to where?
You have no place to go.

04:19.149 --> 04:21.709
- You can't see anyone
from when you were alive,

04:21.760 --> 04:22.989
before you were a ghost.

04:23.030 --> 04:25.249
Donna said that
would be a disaster.

04:25.290 --> 04:27.395
- I don't want to see anyone
from my old life.

04:27.430 --> 04:30.866
I'm gonna hitchhike across
the country, lose my virginity.

04:30.900 --> 04:33.164
- Sounds like the
great American novel

04:33.200 --> 04:35.862
or a great way to get
chopped up into little pieces,

04:35.900 --> 04:37.163
but that's just me.

04:37.210 --> 04:39.008
- No, I agree with
him for once.

04:39.040 --> 04:41.737
Stevie, you have no money.
You have no place to stay.

04:41.780 --> 04:43.703
You're gonna end up
giving "tuggers”

04:43.750 --> 04:45.479
under the bridge
for 5 bucks a go.

04:45.510 --> 04:47.672
- Sally, we made it
out of limbo!

04:47.720 --> 04:48.846
We beat death!

04:48.880 --> 04:50.143
I woke up in my coffin

04:50.190 --> 04:52.352
while you guys rubbed
some dude's blood

04:52.390 --> 04:53.880
and other chunky
bits on me.

04:53.920 --> 04:55.615
I think I can handle
Boston Common.

04:55.660 --> 04:57.526
- OK, well, at least
let Josh give you

04:57.560 --> 04:59.028
a couple hundred
bucks to get by.

04:59.060 --> 05:01.995
- Just a couple hundred dollars?
- No big deal.

05:02.030 --> 05:04.192
- So that's the going rate
for getting by?

05:04.230 --> 05:05.766
- Sounds about right.

05:05.800 --> 05:06.961
- Yeah, OK.

05:07.000 --> 05:09.367
That's all I have.
- Thanks, dog!

05:09.410 --> 05:11.333
Didn't mean it
that way, sorry.

05:12.980 --> 05:14.709
- OK.

05:19.180 --> 05:22.150
It's funny. We never got to know
each other before we died.

05:22.180 --> 05:24.239
- Look, you gave me
a 2nd chance.

05:24.290 --> 05:27.180
I promise I won't
kill myself this time.

05:29.430 --> 05:31.057
- Just be happy, OK?

05:31.090 --> 05:32.398
(Cell ringing)

05:32.430 --> 05:34.956
Remember, it's all fixable,
no matter what happens.

05:35.000 --> 05:36.866
- Yeah.

05:38.570 --> 05:41.335
(Ringing continues)

05:42.340 --> 05:43.967
- Hello.

05:47.180 --> 05:48.807
Oh my God.

05:48.840 --> 05:51.070
(Birds chirping)

05:51.110 --> 05:53.317
- He's over there.
I got him! I got him!

05:53.350 --> 05:56.342
Aidan! Oh!

05:57.350 --> 05:58.749
Oh!

05:58.790 --> 06:01.213
(Squealing)

06:03.490 --> 06:05.049
Hi!

06:05.090 --> 06:06.455
(Laughing)

06:06.500 --> 06:08.093
Hi!

06:10.100 --> 06:11.295
(Sighing)

06:13.440 --> 06:15.465
- Whoa! Wait a second.
Hold on, man!

06:15.500 --> 06:17.138
What? I can feel you.

06:17.170 --> 06:20.276
- I got the
body back!

06:21.040 --> 06:24.146
It's a long,
bloody story. Go.

06:25.350 --> 06:26.909
(Sighing)

06:28.220 --> 06:29.688
- Are you OK?

06:29.720 --> 06:32.883
- Clearly not OK. He looks like
a serial killer from the '70s.

06:32.920 --> 06:34.388
- Is she possessing a twin

06:34.420 --> 06:36.184
that we didn't know she had?

06:36.220 --> 06:38.757
Are you?
- No, no. It's 100% me.

06:38.790 --> 06:42.055
Josh saddled up with a witch
and sprung me out of limbo.

06:42.100 --> 06:43.192
- What?

06:43.230 --> 06:45.767
- She never actually called
herself a witch.

06:45.800 --> 06:47.689
- It was gruesome.
They had to slather me

06:47.740 --> 06:50.801
in blood sauce and drape me
like the Bride of Frankenstein.

06:50.840 --> 06:53.002
- Wait! Blood magic?
- I hate that term.

06:53.040 --> 06:54.269
They call surgery blood magic.

06:54.310 --> 06:56.301
- Did you have to take a life?
- No!

06:56.340 --> 06:58.547
- Just killed Ray
and cut out his heart.

06:58.580 --> 07:01.948
- Thank you for announcing that
to the parking lot, the patrons.

07:01.980 --> 07:03.288
Can we freak out
in the car?

07:03.320 --> 07:05.414
- You don't smell
like dog anymore.

07:05.450 --> 07:07.509
- Yeah, that's--
that's another thing.

07:07.560 --> 07:08.880
- What, are you human?

07:08.920 --> 07:12.254
- Yeah. Yeah, totally
broke my brain too.

07:30.450 --> 07:31.542
(Sirens in distance)

07:31.580 --> 07:33.742
Ugh, blood bags.

07:33.780 --> 07:34.975
Of course.

07:35.020 --> 07:37.284
We need some Dom up
in this piece!

07:37.320 --> 07:39.345
- Champagne's
on the list.

07:39.390 --> 07:41.381
The non-Dom kind.

07:41.420 --> 07:44.481
- I have been working on this
reunion menu for months.

07:44.530 --> 07:46.123
(Gasps)

07:46.160 --> 07:49.619
- Oh, I can see your face and
you're no longer terrifying!

07:49.670 --> 07:52.970
- So you didn't like the
Ulysses S. Grant look? My bad.

07:53.000 --> 07:54.468
- No, man. I liked it.

07:54.500 --> 07:57.060
You looked like a young Moses.
It was nice.

07:57.110 --> 07:58.532
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

07:58.570 --> 08:01.972
Sally, as the newest
member of the "hu-mom" race,

08:02.010 --> 08:04.399
I think you
should pick dessert.

08:04.450 --> 08:07.112
- I choose to not
stay in like a corpse,

08:07.150 --> 08:09.016
no offense
to your menu.

08:09.050 --> 08:10.688
Look, you just got
your life back.

08:10.720 --> 08:14.281
I'm alive. Aidan's no
longer sealed in a coffin.

08:14.320 --> 08:16.379
We're gonna tear
it up tonight.

08:16.420 --> 08:19.754
- Well, the only place that
I'm gonna be tearing it up

08:19.800 --> 08:21.154
is my storage unit.

08:21.200 --> 08:22.998
It's a full moon.
Sorry, Sally.

08:23.030 --> 08:24.395
But you guys go.
Have fun.

08:24.430 --> 08:26.194
- We'll talk about that.
But, Sally,

08:26.230 --> 08:29.029
what if you see somebody you
know? Donna said you can't

08:29.070 --> 08:30.731
see anybody
from your past.

08:30.770 --> 08:31.931
- Sorry, who's Donna?

08:31.970 --> 08:33.734
- (Both):
The witch.

08:33.780 --> 08:36.544
- Look, I'm gonna have
to go out eventually, right?

08:36.580 --> 08:38.639
I'll just wear
a burga or something.

08:38.679 --> 08:40.443
- A burqa.

08:40.480 --> 08:43.813
- Speaking of which,
can I borrow another outfit?

08:43.850 --> 08:45.511
Not that you have
burga clothes.

08:45.550 --> 08:46.813
- Yes. Come on.

08:46.860 --> 08:49.010
I'll show you something from
my slutty punk phase.

08:49.060 --> 08:50.585
- That's what
I'm talking about.

08:50.630 --> 08:53.349
- I've never seen anything
from the slutty punk phase.

08:53.400 --> 08:54.959
Good. Glad she's
showing Sally.

08:55.000 --> 08:56.422
(Sighing)

08:56.460 --> 09:00.090
- So, reanimated corpse?
- Mm-hmm.

09:00.140 --> 09:01.539
But let's be honest,

09:01.570 --> 09:04.301
I mean, you are also kind
of a reanimated corpse,

09:04.340 --> 09:06.104
technically
speaking, right?

09:06.140 --> 09:08.529
- Raising the dead.
Uh, you don't mess with that.

09:08.580 --> 09:12.949
- Yeah, believe me, my idea
of date night with Nora

09:12.980 --> 09:15.711
was not digging up
4 corpses, OK?

09:15.750 --> 09:16.945
- Four corpses?

09:16.990 --> 09:19.049
- Four of them.
It's insane. Yeah.

09:19.090 --> 09:21.479
I just wanted to bring
Sally the ghost back, OK?

09:21.520 --> 09:24.524
And somehow I ended up
with the full monty.

09:24.560 --> 09:28.554
To be honest, I am far more
worried about you right now.

09:28.600 --> 09:29.692
- Shhh!

09:29.730 --> 09:31.164
- I tried to find you, man.

09:31.200 --> 09:33.840
I--I tracked down
every vampire I could.

09:33.870 --> 09:35.463
Nobody knew anything.

09:35.500 --> 09:38.629
And then there were less and
less vampires every month. I--

09:40.210 --> 09:43.145
I thought you were dead.

09:43.180 --> 09:45.672
- Well, I was 6 feet under.

09:45.710 --> 09:46.677
(Chuckles)

09:46.720 --> 09:48.370
But that saved me.

09:56.120 --> 09:59.897
- I've been switching out the
blood bags every couple months,

09:59.930 --> 10:01.557
hoping you'd be back,
obviously.

10:01.600 --> 10:04.160
I mean, you can drink from me.
I'm human now.

10:04.200 --> 10:06.396
But I didn't know
if there was, like,

10:06.430 --> 10:08.194
werewolf traces left in me,

10:08.240 --> 10:10.709
so I didn't want to
give you a seizure.

10:10.740 --> 10:14.836
- I can't drink that, because
there's no way of knowing

10:14.880 --> 10:16.803
whether the donor
had the virus.

10:16.850 --> 10:19.911
- The virus? So it is
in the blood supply.

10:19.950 --> 10:23.045
Why are humans not
affected by it?

10:23.090 --> 10:24.546
- There is this flu.

10:24.590 --> 10:27.480
- I had it. It knocked me on
my ass for, like, a week.

10:27.520 --> 10:29.955
- Right. Yeah, it knocks
humans on their ass,

10:29.990 --> 10:31.287
but it wipes
out vampires.

10:31.330 --> 10:33.492
And the way that
you get it is by drinking

10:33.530 --> 10:35.589
the blood of someone
who had the flu.

10:35.630 --> 10:39.089
- So, Sally is rifling through
my closet like a teenager.

10:39.130 --> 10:40.438
- Mm-hmm.

10:40.470 --> 10:42.495
- And I am gonna go
pick up some raw sirloin

10:42.540 --> 10:45.566
and try not to scarf it
all down in the parking lot.

10:45.610 --> 10:47.430
- Good. Really,
treat yourself.

10:47.480 --> 10:48.800
- OK, T'll see
you later.

10:48.840 --> 10:49.807
- All right. Bye.

10:49.850 --> 10:51.079
- Bye. Bye.

10:51.110 --> 10:52.305
- Bye.

10:56.250 --> 10:59.083
How long have you
two been living together?

10:59.120 --> 11:00.952
- Yeah, I guess we
should probably talk

11:00.990 --> 11:02.458
about the roommate
situation, huh?

11:02.490 --> 11:04.185
- That's not
what I mean. I--

11:05.560 --> 11:09.019
It's just good
to see you happy.

11:09.060 --> 11:12.690
- Yeah. It still blows my mind
that Nora doesn't hate me.

11:12.740 --> 11:15.129
(Heart beating and
Josh talking, indistinct)

11:15.170 --> 11:17.229
- I'm-- What were you saying?

11:17.270 --> 11:18.829
- It's obviously
not important, no.

11:18.870 --> 11:21.271
- I just-- T'll catch up
with you guys later.

11:21.310 --> 11:22.505
- Yeah, great.

11:22.540 --> 11:24.008
- I gotta take
care of some stuff.

11:24.050 --> 11:25.245
- I'll just go with you.

11:25.280 --> 11:27.317
No, I can help you
with the stuff.

11:27.350 --> 11:28.840
- No, no, no.
I got it.

11:28.880 --> 11:32.418
- Aidan, I spent the last year
hunting down vampires

11:32.450 --> 11:35.056
and interrogating them
to find you.

11:35.090 --> 11:36.455
(Sighing)

11:36.490 --> 11:38.822
You don't need to protect
me anymore. I'm fine.

11:38.860 --> 11:40.851
- Josh, um...

11:42.060 --> 11:46.395
do you remember when you didn't
want us to see you turn?

11:47.470 --> 11:50.269
Well, uh, there are
still some things

11:50.310 --> 11:52.870
that I don't
want you to see.

11:59.850 --> 12:02.239
(Siren in distance)

12:03.990 --> 12:05.913
- Yeah, Nora's off today.

12:06.720 --> 12:08.711
- Oh. Well, it's
a family emergency.

12:08.760 --> 12:12.424
Do you have an address for her
I might be able to reach her at?

12:12.460 --> 12:14.690
- We can't give out
personal information.

12:14.730 --> 12:17.495
But you can leave
a message on her voicemail.

12:17.530 --> 12:22.434
- No, this, uh, this has
to be handled in person.

12:30.850 --> 12:32.944
- Where are you
taking Sally tonight?

12:32.980 --> 12:34.618
- God! Uh...

12:35.480 --> 12:38.450
I think I read about
this new bar in Copley.

12:38.490 --> 12:39.685
- Well, I want pictures.

12:39.720 --> 12:42.417
- Yeah, I'll text
them to you at mid-turn.

12:43.890 --> 12:44.880
- Josh...

12:46.560 --> 12:48.221
Hey.

12:49.030 --> 12:51.328
I know what you do...

12:52.130 --> 12:54.531
all the full moons.

12:54.570 --> 12:56.868
You drop me off,
make this big show

12:56.910 --> 13:00.801
of all the foreign films
you're gonna catch,

13:01.940 --> 13:04.807
the artisanal ales
you're gonna sample.

13:06.010 --> 13:10.379
And then you sit there
outside the unit all night...

13:11.290 --> 13:13.258
making sure
that I'm OK.

13:16.620 --> 13:20.659
My wolf can hear you
and smell you.

13:22.760 --> 13:24.467
- Why didn't you
say anything?

13:24.500 --> 13:28.767
- Because I knew you felt like
you were protecting me...

13:29.800 --> 13:31.564
watching over me.

13:32.880 --> 13:36.407
And that made you feel less
guilty about being human.

13:38.350 --> 13:40.614
And it did comfort me.

13:40.650 --> 13:43.187
- Good, then I'll be
there every time.

13:43.220 --> 13:44.187
- No.

13:44.220 --> 13:46.086
What we did to Ray,

13:46.120 --> 13:48.589
it was for nothing

13:48.620 --> 13:51.089
if you can't let
yourself be free.

13:52.190 --> 13:55.728
Right now, you're still
living like you're a wolf.

13:55.760 --> 13:58.320
You don't have to
save me anymore,

13:58.370 --> 14:00.464
or Sally or Aidan.

14:01.240 --> 14:03.868
Don't let us
hold you back.

14:03.910 --> 14:07.073
- You don't hold me back.
You make me stronger.

14:07.110 --> 14:08.271
(Chuckles)

14:08.310 --> 14:10.404
- You make me
stronger too.

14:13.280 --> 14:14.873
So go.

14:15.880 --> 14:17.279
Leave me alone.

14:18.350 --> 14:21.149
And for the love of God,
please take Sally shopping.

14:21.190 --> 14:22.157
(Laughing)

14:22.190 --> 14:23.589
Because I'm pretty sure

14:23.630 --> 14:25.724
that she's wearing
my favourite bra right now.

14:25.760 --> 14:27.057
(Knocking)

14:30.700 --> 14:34.739
- Haven't seen one of
you guys in months.

14:34.770 --> 14:38.001
But I got that bug
that went around.

14:38.040 --> 14:39.701
My blood's no good.

14:40.510 --> 14:42.899
- OK. Um...

14:44.650 --> 14:47.540
Can I come in and talk
to you for a minute?

14:47.580 --> 14:50.550
- My blood would kill you.

14:50.590 --> 14:52.080
Got it, hon?

14:57.730 --> 15:00.495
- I've made all
the rounds.

15:02.430 --> 15:03.966
Could you put the word out?

15:04.000 --> 15:06.935
There's gotta be someone
with clean blood.

15:06.970 --> 15:09.530
- I don't know
if he's even real,

15:09.570 --> 15:11.004
but I heard of a guy--

15:11.040 --> 15:13.099
- Who?

15:13.880 --> 15:16.804
Who is he?
What's his name?”?

15:22.950 --> 15:24.020
(Scoffing)

15:24.050 --> 15:25.688
Where do I find him?

15:27.120 --> 15:29.509
- Um, we'll have
the Maine lobster rolls

15:29.560 --> 15:32.257
with truffle fries,
sushi platter,

15:32.290 --> 15:37.023
- and another one of these
insane pomegranate deals for me.

15:37.070 --> 15:38.925
- (Waitress): Great!
- Thank you.

15:38.970 --> 15:39.994
(Sighing)

15:40.040 --> 15:42.361
You look like
you're about to cry.

15:42.400 --> 15:44.869
Is this because
I'm bankrupting you?

15:44.910 --> 15:46.366
- No! No.

15:46.410 --> 15:48.504
A little bit.
- OK.

15:48.540 --> 15:50.645
- But no, no. We're here.
- I know!

15:50.680 --> 15:53.342
- And you're actually
occupying physical space.

15:53.380 --> 15:54.677
- Ah!

15:54.720 --> 15:55.915
- I don't have to be on

15:55.950 --> 15:57.384
a Bluetooth to talk to you.

15:57.420 --> 15:59.741
And this is the
first full moon

15:59.790 --> 16:03.021
that I've spent outside,
out in the world,

16:03.060 --> 16:06.155
since I no longer
howl at it.

16:06.190 --> 16:07.919
- Get out.

16:07.960 --> 16:10.463
- I was always with Nora,
making sure she was safe.

16:10.500 --> 16:12.059
- Josh!
- I know! I know! I know.

16:12.100 --> 16:14.933
- Well, this is our night.
What do you wanna do?

16:15.740 --> 16:17.401
- Aren't we doing it?

16:17.440 --> 16:20.330
- Josh, come on.
Shoot for the moon!

16:20.380 --> 16:24.942
- So, what would I do
if I could do anything?

16:24.980 --> 16:26.050
- Yes.

16:26.080 --> 16:27.377
(Clearing throat)

16:27.420 --> 16:28.740
- I'd...

16:29.550 --> 16:31.985
I would ask Nora
to marry me.

16:33.990 --> 16:35.389
- Wow.

16:35.420 --> 16:38.583
- Yeah. Yeah.

16:38.630 --> 16:41.895
- That's so not where
I was going with this.

16:44.100 --> 16:47.161
- How do I know that
it's, uh, clean?

16:47.200 --> 16:48.929
- You can smell it, bro.

16:48.970 --> 16:51.667
This blood just came
crying into this world.

16:57.710 --> 16:59.576
Gotta keep
you dudes alive

16:59.610 --> 17:01.920
or there's nobody
to sell it to.

17:03.020 --> 17:05.512
- Wait. Ho--ho--hold on
for a second!

17:09.760 --> 17:11.979
- You sick son
of a bitch.

17:12.030 --> 17:15.295
Baby blood? There's a special
place in hell for you.

17:17.069 --> 17:19.721
- Yeah, well, T'll see
you there, wolf.

17:21.300 --> 17:23.268
(Grunting)

17:29.010 --> 17:30.705
(Groaning)

17:38.650 --> 17:41.711
- Now you know
what it feels like.

17:41.760 --> 17:43.728
- This is our time.

17:47.430 --> 17:49.626
(Sniffling and gasping)

17:51.670 --> 17:54.367
- I thought it was
some crazy rumour.

17:54.400 --> 17:57.631
- How did you make it?

17:57.670 --> 17:59.035
Get--get away
from Mother?

17:59.070 --> 18:00.902
- Not the first time
I've had to

18:00.940 --> 18:03.147
give up a little skin
to survive.

18:06.710 --> 18:08.041
Get up.

18:09.280 --> 18:10.679
Get up.

18:10.720 --> 18:12.415
(Groaning)

18:12.450 --> 18:13.656
(Wheezing)

18:14.490 --> 18:16.117
- I'm sorry.

18:16.160 --> 18:18.322
(Whimpering)

18:20.330 --> 18:22.025
I'm so sorry.

18:22.060 --> 18:24.062
I'm sorry.

18:24.100 --> 18:26.819
- Yeah, I mean,
it was--it was this year,

18:26.870 --> 18:29.896
you know,
Nora and I alone.

18:29.940 --> 18:34.377
Uh, even the-- even the
Ray thing, it just--

18:34.410 --> 18:36.378
It--it made us closer.

18:36.410 --> 18:38.276
- Why not just
keep living together?

18:38.310 --> 18:42.247
- Because if I'm really free,
if I'm really human,

18:42.280 --> 18:44.089
then this is
the most human thing

18:44.120 --> 18:45.679
that I could
possibly want.

18:45.720 --> 18:48.519
Honestly, if she
wasn't a wolf,

18:48.560 --> 18:50.358
I would've done
it already.

18:51.360 --> 18:52.122
- OK.

18:52.160 --> 18:53.628
(Cocktail shaker rattling)

18:53.660 --> 18:54.650
I love Nora.

18:54.700 --> 18:56.350
It's not that.

18:56.400 --> 18:57.925
But you just got human

18:57.970 --> 19:00.268
and you haven't
even enjoyed it yet.

19:00.300 --> 19:02.359
Maybe you should
just take a beat...

19:02.400 --> 19:03.504
- Sally?

19:03.540 --> 19:05.406
- Oh God!

19:05.440 --> 19:06.510
Oh God!

19:06.540 --> 19:07.632
- Sally Malik.

19:07.680 --> 19:09.034
- Oh God.

19:09.080 --> 19:11.174
- Uh, I think you--

19:11.210 --> 19:13.747
I think you have
the wrong person.

19:13.780 --> 19:15.646
- It's Trent.
Trent Harris.

19:15.680 --> 19:17.045
- I, uh, I--I--

19:17.080 --> 19:19.549
I really, um...
What's the name again?

19:19.590 --> 19:24.255
- Holy Mother!
Sally, I was at your funeral.

19:26.560 --> 19:27.857
(Groans)

19:27.900 --> 19:29.026
- Oh, wow!

19:29.060 --> 19:30.767
This is your place?

19:30.800 --> 19:32.529
- I have taste.

19:32.570 --> 19:34.197
- You found him.

19:34.240 --> 19:37.301
- Aidan, this is
my girlfriend, Emma.

19:39.370 --> 19:41.509
(Heart beating,
Aidan gasps)

19:42.710 --> 19:44.940
- Hi... miss.

19:44.980 --> 19:47.779
Oh, wow.
I'm sorry about the...

19:47.820 --> 19:49.447
- Being covered in blood?

19:49.480 --> 19:51.881
Friggin' werewolves
are a menace.

19:51.920 --> 19:53.684
- Yeah.

19:53.720 --> 19:56.212
She knows about
werewolves.

19:56.260 --> 19:58.979
- Henry's told me about them.

19:59.030 --> 20:00.828
I can't believe
this is your dad.

20:00.860 --> 20:02.692
- He's got like
200 years on me.

20:02.730 --> 20:04.494
Look closely.
You can see it.

20:04.530 --> 20:06.396
(All chuckling)

20:06.430 --> 20:09.036
Two most important
people in my life.

20:09.070 --> 20:11.732
What a difference
a year makes.

20:11.770 --> 20:13.534
(Sighing)

20:13.580 --> 20:16.106
- Danny was-- He was nuts.

20:16.140 --> 20:20.611
He was possessive
and jealous and violent.

20:20.650 --> 20:21.845
And so...

20:22.920 --> 20:24.240
(Sighing)

20:24.290 --> 20:26.418
What I had to do
was, um...

20:27.560 --> 20:31.224
I had to fake my own death
to get away from him.

20:33.860 --> 20:35.851
- Holy crap.
That's insane.

20:35.900 --> 20:38.062
- Yeah, it's insane.

20:38.100 --> 20:40.159
It's completely
unbelievable.

20:40.200 --> 20:42.168
- Yeah.
- But nobody knew?

20:42.200 --> 20:43.668
I mean, not even your family?

20:43.710 --> 20:45.439
- No. No, no, no.

20:45.470 --> 20:46.699
Couldn't risk it. Yeah.

20:46.740 --> 20:49.732
The whole think was like
a Watergate-level cover up.

20:49.780 --> 20:51.145
- Man.

20:52.050 --> 20:53.643
I was a wreck
at your funeral.

20:53.680 --> 20:55.876
- You were?

20:55.920 --> 20:57.445
(Chuckles)

20:57.490 --> 21:00.460
(Man singing pop rock on
sound system, indistinct)

21:00.490 --> 21:03.152
- OK, um, Trent,

21:03.190 --> 21:05.921
it's been really lovely
watching you guys catch up,

21:05.960 --> 21:07.621
but Sally,
it's--it's--

21:07.660 --> 21:11.062
We gotta get going,
"cause we gotta-- we gotta--

21:11.100 --> 21:13.398
We gotta let the cat in.

21:13.440 --> 21:15.238
She's super sick.

21:15.270 --> 21:17.329
- Wait, you guys--
You live together?

21:17.370 --> 21:19.600
- No, no, no.
We're just roommates.

21:19.640 --> 21:22.109
Um, you know what, though?
Is-- What--

21:22.140 --> 21:24.609
I think--I think
the cat's fine,

21:24.650 --> 21:27.574
now that she's out of
the bag, so to speak.

21:27.620 --> 21:30.442
- The cat's not fine.
The cat's not fine.

21:30.490 --> 21:32.083
We picked up
a street cat.

21:32.120 --> 21:33.588
Um, Ki--Kibby.

21:33.620 --> 21:36.487
And we practically brought
her back from the dead.

21:36.520 --> 21:41.492
And right now, it's probably
running around, reanimated,

21:41.530 --> 21:45.091
with another --
a bunch of other --

21:45.130 --> 21:47.189
uh, cats from
its former life,

21:47.230 --> 21:49.870
which, for a cat...

21:49.900 --> 21:52.039
is the worst
thing she can do.

21:54.340 --> 21:57.878
- So, does Robbie
know that you're alive?

21:57.910 --> 21:59.275
- Robbie?
- Sally's brother.

21:59.310 --> 22:02.143
We know each other
from high school.

22:02.180 --> 22:04.342
- You have a brother?
- Yeah, we don't talk.

22:04.390 --> 22:07.382
Uh, actually,
I don't know where he is.

22:07.420 --> 22:09.559
But hey, I wanna know
more about my funeral.

22:09.590 --> 22:13.151
Like, who gave the best eulogy,
who was dressed like a ho?

22:13.190 --> 22:15.124
Josh, would you
be a total mensch

22:15.160 --> 22:18.721
and get me one of these,
uh, "pomegranini” thingies?

22:18.770 --> 22:20.534
I really like them.

22:25.470 --> 22:27.871
- Boston's crawling
with wolves now.

22:27.910 --> 22:29.400
They go hunting
on the full moon,

22:29.440 --> 22:31.602
trying to pick off
the few of us left.

22:32.650 --> 22:34.869
- How did you find me?

22:34.920 --> 22:38.311
- We're tight now,
the leftovers.

22:38.350 --> 22:40.239
We keep tabs
on each other.

22:40.290 --> 22:43.180
I knew as soon as you started
asking around for blood,

22:43.220 --> 22:44.722
figured you'd go to Tracy.

22:44.760 --> 22:47.058
I got her to tell me
where she sent you.

22:47.090 --> 22:48.421
(Sighing)

22:48.460 --> 22:50.770
- So Tracy is working
for the wolves now.

22:51.830 --> 22:53.298
- Consider yourself lucky.

22:53.330 --> 22:57.039
If you'd actually got blood
off the black market,

22:57.070 --> 22:58.299
you'd be dead.

22:58.340 --> 22:59.739
That whole trade's a scam.

22:59.770 --> 23:01.932
You can't get
guaranteed clean blood.

23:01.980 --> 23:03.209
- So how do
you manage?

23:03.240 --> 23:04.708
- I got lucky.

23:04.750 --> 23:06.377
(Chuckles)

23:06.410 --> 23:09.175
- I never got that flu.

23:09.220 --> 23:10.881
It's good for both
of us this way.

23:10.920 --> 23:14.584
At least I can be sure Henry
isn't snacking on blood whores.

23:14.620 --> 23:17.590
(All laughing)

23:17.630 --> 23:21.555
- Look at us. And you're about
to pass out on the couch here.

23:21.600 --> 23:23.591
(Sighing)

23:33.310 --> 23:35.574
Emma will feed
you tonight.

23:38.150 --> 23:41.176
Just enough to get you
back on your feet.

23:51.160 --> 23:52.753
- Josh, you should--

23:54.600 --> 23:55.954
Who are you?

23:56.000 --> 23:58.367
- I apologize for the intrusion.

23:58.400 --> 24:02.098
I'm Liam McLean,
Connor and Brynn's father.

24:03.910 --> 24:06.060
I came to find her.

24:11.180 --> 24:14.571
- How did you know I was here?
- Brynn's brought your name up.

24:14.620 --> 24:17.419
I thought she was joking
when she said you wolfed in.

24:17.450 --> 24:21.216
This place is
worse than a kennel.

24:21.260 --> 24:23.752
We have a big place
in New Hampshire,

24:23.790 --> 24:26.623
which you'd be more than
welcome to use, if you like.

24:26.660 --> 24:29.493
Didn't Brynn ever mention it?

24:29.530 --> 24:33.296
- Mr. McLean, I'm sorry,
but we can talk tomorrow.

24:34.100 --> 24:35.590
You have
to go now.

24:35.640 --> 24:37.836
We're gonna be
turning soon.

24:39.370 --> 24:41.236
- We still have
some time.

24:41.280 --> 24:43.305
You know, the one thing

24:43.340 --> 24:47.470
my parents and my children
both agreed on is that...

24:47.520 --> 24:49.147
(Sighing)

24:49.180 --> 24:51.615
...I'm too impatient
and, uh...

24:53.760 --> 24:55.182
too direct.

24:59.860 --> 25:01.749
Today, I found my...

25:03.060 --> 25:04.619
dead son...

25:05.670 --> 25:07.798
nailed to
the wall, like...

25:08.970 --> 25:10.734
like a rat.

25:10.770 --> 25:13.330
- I'm so sorry
for your loss.

25:14.710 --> 25:16.872
I didn't know.

25:18.150 --> 25:19.276
(Nora gasps)

25:19.310 --> 25:21.347
- No! Aaah!

25:21.380 --> 25:24.111
- Brynn's been out of
contact for months.

25:24.150 --> 25:27.347
I haven't been
able to reach her.

25:28.690 --> 25:30.852
- I don't know
where she is.

25:32.490 --> 25:35.255
I haven't seen her
in over a year.

25:36.530 --> 25:38.624
- She and I are
very close.

25:39.970 --> 25:41.495
(Exhaling slowly)

25:42.970 --> 25:46.406
And you were the last
person she talked about.

25:47.310 --> 25:49.631
She told me that
you were a sister.

25:49.680 --> 25:52.308
From Brynn, that's
the highest praise.

25:53.110 --> 25:55.340
- I wish I knew more.

25:56.720 --> 26:00.816
We were in New York
for a while, upstate.

26:01.820 --> 26:04.187
I haven't heard
from her since.

26:04.230 --> 26:07.928
- Nora, I can
smell your fear.

26:09.960 --> 26:11.428
- We ran together.

26:11.470 --> 26:14.440
Those were the wildest...

26:15.400 --> 26:18.233
most savage weeks
of my life.

26:19.040 --> 26:22.704
- You think my daughter
is a savage?

26:24.750 --> 26:27.003
- I couldn't
keep up with her.

26:27.050 --> 26:28.142
(Grunts)

26:28.180 --> 26:29.944
So I left.

26:29.980 --> 26:31.584
(Grunts)

26:36.390 --> 26:38.381
- All right.

26:42.960 --> 26:44.189
- What are you doing?

26:44.230 --> 26:46.392
- We change together.
- No.

26:46.430 --> 26:48.797
We'll kill each other!
There's no room!

26:48.840 --> 26:51.502
- My wolf will find out
what kind of wolf you are,

26:51.540 --> 26:54.032
if you can be trusted...

26:55.080 --> 26:56.536
or if you're lying.

26:56.580 --> 27:00.744
I'll know the truth
of your character.

27:07.860 --> 27:10.750
- Someone's getting
laid tonight.

27:12.030 --> 27:13.259
That's one slamming ring.

27:13.290 --> 27:16.055
(Woman on sound system):
* Shake shake shake...

27:16.100 --> 27:17.056
- You think so?

27:17.100 --> 27:18.989
- Can I?

27:19.030 --> 27:20.020
- Sure.

27:21.170 --> 27:23.832
(Screaming)

27:25.840 --> 27:26.830
(Roaring)

27:27.640 --> 27:29.608
- Hey! We're out
of here, chief.

27:29.640 --> 27:33.042
I'm taking Trent back to
the house like a goodie bag.

27:33.080 --> 27:34.912
- Our house?

27:34.950 --> 27:38.011
- Yeah, well, we've already
been making out at the table,

27:38.050 --> 27:39.120
so do you mind if we go?

27:39.150 --> 27:41.118
Just give us
a couple hours' lead time?

27:41.160 --> 27:42.286
One, two, maybe three?

27:42.320 --> 27:43.685
- You can't bone Trent!

27:43.730 --> 27:45.027
You can't--
- Josh!

27:45.060 --> 27:46.050
- Donna said you can't

27:46.090 --> 27:47.489
see anyone from your past.

27:47.530 --> 27:49.396
- That's already
been blown to hell!

27:49.430 --> 27:52.730
- 24 hours ago, you looked
like Norman Bates' mother.

27:52.770 --> 27:56.968
OK? I don't even know if
you can have... relations.

27:57.000 --> 28:00.607
- Are you saying that my insides
are full of dust and cobwebs?

28:00.640 --> 28:03.974
- No. No. I'm just saying I--

28:04.010 --> 28:05.500
I have no clue

28:05.550 --> 28:09.271
how a reanimated
body functions.

28:09.320 --> 28:12.745
- Stop calling me "reanimated".
It makes me sound like a zombie.

28:14.560 --> 28:17.609
Please?

28:17.660 --> 28:19.628
- Right. You're right.
You're right.

28:19.660 --> 28:22.493
All right, you're alive.

28:23.300 --> 28:24.722
And you're lovely.

28:24.770 --> 28:27.831
And you are not wearing that
"fugly" sweater anymore.

28:27.870 --> 28:28.792
- Amen.

28:28.840 --> 28:30.490
- So go. So go bone.
Bone away.

28:30.540 --> 28:31.507
(Laughing)

28:31.540 --> 28:32.507
Yes.

28:32.540 --> 28:33.905
- Thank you! Amazing.

28:33.940 --> 28:35.999
Now, uh, do you have,
like, a stash of condoms?

28:36.040 --> 28:38.372
Because judging by
the tingly feeling I get

28:38.410 --> 28:40.139
every time Trent brushes
up against me,

28:40.180 --> 28:43.480
I'm pretty sure relations
are fully achievable.

28:43.520 --> 28:45.113
You know what I'm saying?

28:52.190 --> 28:53.180
(Grunts)

28:54.730 --> 28:58.166
(Clearing throat, sniffs)

28:59.730 --> 29:01.596
- You OK with this?

29:01.640 --> 29:03.039
- Mm-hmm!

29:03.070 --> 29:04.629
- OK.

29:04.670 --> 29:06.206
(Exhales sharply)

29:06.240 --> 29:08.106
- It's always so
friggin' hot in here.

29:08.140 --> 29:12.077
- OK, well, you know,
I'll open up the window.

29:13.080 --> 29:14.809
(Sighing)

29:21.260 --> 29:25.754
Uh, these don't open.

29:26.830 --> 29:28.889
- I'm usually pretty
chill about it,

29:28.930 --> 29:31.661
but sometimes I get
a little stir-crazy.

29:34.300 --> 29:37.907
- Well, maybe afterward we can
all go for a beer or something.

29:37.940 --> 29:41.831
- I can't. I can catch
something out there.

29:48.780 --> 29:52.944
- When was the last time
that you went out?

29:53.960 --> 29:56.713
- Just hurry up and do it.

29:56.760 --> 29:59.127
- What is that?

29:59.160 --> 30:00.582
What is this?

30:00.630 --> 30:03.258
You tried to
kill yourself?

30:03.300 --> 30:06.122
(Whispering): Henry
never lets you out?

30:09.670 --> 30:12.367
- I'm gonna die
in here, aren't I?

30:12.410 --> 30:14.333
Like a mouse in a cage.

30:18.010 --> 30:19.569
(Banging)

30:19.610 --> 30:21.317
(Screaming)

30:23.680 --> 30:25.546
(Sighing)

30:25.590 --> 30:27.046
I--I--

30:27.090 --> 30:29.752
I can't even remember
what the wind feels like,

30:29.790 --> 30:33.124
what my mom
sounds like and...

30:33.160 --> 30:36.152
My sister! 1 gotta
get out of here!

30:36.200 --> 30:37.622
- Wait. It's OK.

30:37.660 --> 30:38.889
- No! No! No!

30:38.930 --> 30:41.536
- Look at me. Emmal!
Look at me.

30:41.570 --> 30:43.060
(Crying)

30:43.870 --> 30:45.838
You're safe here.

30:45.870 --> 30:48.476
You're calm, content.

30:49.280 --> 30:52.705
Nothing bad happens
to you here.

30:52.750 --> 30:54.718
You wanna be here.

30:54.750 --> 30:56.343
You love me.

30:56.380 --> 30:57.677
(Aidan grunts)

30:57.720 --> 31:00.018
You would do
anything for me...

31:00.820 --> 31:03.016
just as I would
do for you.

31:03.820 --> 31:06.084
Why don't you
have a nap?

31:17.200 --> 31:19.032
- How long have you
kept her compelled?

31:19.070 --> 31:21.300
You can't keep her
prisoner like a milk cow.

31:21.340 --> 31:24.002
- I can't let Emma
go outside and get sick.

31:24.050 --> 31:25.802
Emma wants to
do this for me.

31:25.850 --> 31:28.444
She gets off on it,
just like you and Celine.

31:29.720 --> 31:31.313
- I never told you
about Celine.

31:31.350 --> 31:33.785
- No, everyone else did.
Do you know why?

31:33.820 --> 31:35.914
Because it was
a good idea.

31:35.960 --> 31:37.519
- I never forced Celine.

31:37.560 --> 31:39.619
I never locked
her inside a box!

31:39.660 --> 31:42.220
- This is the
new normal, Aidan.

31:42.260 --> 31:44.524
You eat on the
street, you die.

31:44.570 --> 31:45.867
- OK.

31:45.900 --> 31:46.992
(Stammering, sighing)

31:47.030 --> 31:49.692
There's gotta be
another option.

31:49.740 --> 31:52.061
- You are so out
of touch right now.

31:52.110 --> 31:53.703
I can't even be mad.
- Henry--

31:53.740 --> 31:55.230
- No!

31:55.280 --> 31:58.807
Aidan, we should
be celebrating,

31:58.850 --> 32:00.409
not fighting.

32:00.450 --> 32:03.317
You just got dug up
from a year underground.

32:03.350 --> 32:05.489
You get a little
something to eat,

32:05.520 --> 32:08.581
the whole world's gonna
look a lot brighter.

32:08.620 --> 32:10.281
(Sighing)

32:10.320 --> 32:13.028
- No, I don't--
I don't think that it will.

32:22.270 --> 32:24.967
* Don't be afraid to say
anything baby *

32:25.010 --> 32:29.004
* Don't be afraid
to say anything unwise... *

32:29.040 --> 32:31.270
- Do you wanna come in?

32:31.310 --> 32:35.816
- Um, I think
I should just go.

32:37.520 --> 32:38.885
- Oh.

32:38.920 --> 32:41.617
OK, is it because
I faked my own death?

32:41.660 --> 32:42.980
I'm not crazy,
I swear.

32:43.020 --> 32:45.284
And I'm not damaged,
if that's what you think.

32:45.330 --> 32:47.025
Do you think
I'm damaged?

32:47.060 --> 32:50.189
- No, no. I was actually
thinking it was the gin.

32:50.230 --> 32:51.322
Um...

32:51.370 --> 32:54.590
I, uh, I just feel
weird all of a sudden.

32:54.640 --> 32:56.267
- You want
some water?

32:57.370 --> 32:59.907
- No. Um...

33:02.340 --> 33:05.605
I wanna take
you out tomorrow.

33:05.650 --> 33:06.902
- Ah!

33:06.950 --> 33:08.975
- Have you ever
been climbing?

33:09.020 --> 33:10.943
- Um, like, uh,

33:10.980 --> 33:13.415
like plastic walls
and toeholds?

33:13.450 --> 33:15.487
- Oh no, I'm talking
granite and ropes.

33:15.520 --> 33:17.784
Most fun you've had
tied up, I promise.

33:17.820 --> 33:19.481
(Both chuckling)

33:20.990 --> 33:23.391
- OK. All right.

33:23.430 --> 33:25.592
That sounds
super dangerous.

33:25.630 --> 33:28.634
Be a shame if I fell and
died for real this time.

33:29.970 --> 33:31.961
- I won't let you fall.

33:32.010 --> 33:33.535
(Giggles)

33:33.570 --> 33:37.404
* Don't be afraid
to say anything baby *

33:37.440 --> 33:42.310
* Don't be afraid to say
anything unwise *

33:47.850 --> 33:52.128
* There's nothing I'd rather do
than say maybe *

33:52.160 --> 33:57.394
* Nothing I'd rather be
than be untied *

33:58.470 --> 34:00.268
(Man laughing)

34:02.000 --> 34:04.935
* From nothing to one

34:06.770 --> 34:08.829
* I'm upstairs

34:08.880 --> 34:10.074
(Howling)

34:11.179 --> 34:14.047
* From nothing to one

34:14.080 --> 34:15.514
* I'm here

34:17.920 --> 34:21.014
* From nothing to one

34:21.050 --> 34:23.690
* I'm upstairs

34:23.719 --> 34:25.154
- Thank you.

34:25.190 --> 34:28.228
* From nothing to one

34:28.260 --> 34:30.524
<i>* Tm scared *</i>

34:32.330 --> 34:35.458
- Maybe it's for the best
that Trent almost barfed on me.

34:35.500 --> 34:38.561
Yeah. I was moving
a little fast.

34:41.480 --> 34:42.969
(Chuckles)

34:43.010 --> 34:47.277
I knew there was a chance 1
would run into someone tonight.

34:47.310 --> 34:50.610
- Uh, so you wanted to give
someone that you knew

34:50.650 --> 34:52.687
a heart attack?

34:53.850 --> 34:58.856
- It just felt so good
for someone to see me.

34:58.890 --> 35:00.483
See me, Sally Malik,

35:00.530 --> 35:04.728
not some random meat suit
I happen to be wearing.

35:06.130 --> 35:10.499
And seeing Trent, it just
made it feel more real.

35:12.210 --> 35:17.080
"Cause this doesn't totally
feel real that I'm here.

35:17.110 --> 35:18.202
(Sighing)

35:18.250 --> 35:20.070
- Yeah, I know
what you mean.

35:22.620 --> 35:24.782
- Do you need to eat?
- Hmm? What?

35:24.820 --> 35:28.688
- You've got that, uh, waxy,
heroin-chic look going on.

35:28.720 --> 35:30.051
- Oh! No.

35:30.090 --> 35:31.387
- Do you wanna try me?

35:31.430 --> 35:33.228
Josh isn't the only
martyr around here.

35:33.260 --> 35:34.694
- You know what? No.

35:34.730 --> 35:37.290
That's because you've been
raised from the dead.

35:37.330 --> 35:40.391
As I understand it, it's
like drinking vampire blood,

35:40.430 --> 35:43.491
so I wouldn't get any real
sustenance from you, so...

35:44.540 --> 35:45.905
(Sighing)

35:45.940 --> 35:47.260
- Mm-hmm?

35:47.310 --> 35:49.938
You'd tell us if you were
in trouble, right?

35:49.980 --> 35:51.641
- Oh yeah.

35:51.680 --> 35:53.341
- Liar.

35:53.380 --> 35:56.315
This is what you do. You're all
stoic and withholding,

35:56.350 --> 35:58.489
trying to take care of
everything on your own,

35:58.520 --> 36:00.841
and then you end up
getting buried for a year,

36:00.890 --> 36:02.449
worrying Josh sick.

36:02.490 --> 36:05.152
- Oh, not unlike you taking
matters into your own hands,

36:05.190 --> 36:06.555
committing ghost suicide

36:06.590 --> 36:09.298
and getting stranded
in limbo without a plan

36:09.330 --> 36:11.765
and worrying Josh sick.

36:11.800 --> 36:13.165
- Yeah, just like that.

36:13.200 --> 36:14.736
(Chuckles)

36:14.770 --> 36:18.559
The point is, is that all
the awful, terrible things

36:18.610 --> 36:21.170
you think that
I can't handle,

36:21.210 --> 36:22.530
I've lived them.

36:26.150 --> 36:27.345
(Sighing)

36:28.550 --> 36:29.540
- Oh! Wow!

36:30.480 --> 36:32.744
I just-- I can't get over

36:32.790 --> 36:37.557
the fact that
I can touch you. It's...

36:40.790 --> 36:43.555
- You're less cold than
I thought you'd be.

36:50.000 --> 36:52.230
- OK, that's weird.

36:52.270 --> 36:54.739
No, that's not weird.

36:54.780 --> 36:58.444
Uh, it's just
the fact that you're...

36:58.480 --> 37:00.073
- I'm solid.
- Yes.

37:00.110 --> 37:01.544
- And you're solid.
- Yes.

37:01.580 --> 37:02.741
(Grunts)

37:02.780 --> 37:06.580
- Just, the bottom line
is we're damn lucky.

37:06.620 --> 37:07.610
- Mm-hmm.

37:07.650 --> 37:10.620
- We can do everything
right this time.

37:11.660 --> 37:13.685
- Yeah.

37:17.760 --> 37:19.262
(Birds chirping)

37:19.300 --> 37:21.064
(Footsteps on stairs)

37:21.100 --> 37:22.534
- Hey!

37:22.570 --> 37:23.890
- Hi!

37:23.940 --> 37:26.204
- OK, so one thing I do miss
about being a ghost

37:26.240 --> 37:29.403
is I woke up this morning, tried
to whoosh myself down here,

37:29.440 --> 37:30.703
and fell onto my face.

37:32.450 --> 37:33.645
Did you sleep
down here?

37:33.680 --> 37:35.239
- No, I didn't sleep.
- Huh!

37:35.280 --> 37:38.511
- Uh, walked around
downtown all night

37:38.550 --> 37:40.382
because I... could.
- Hmm!

37:40.420 --> 37:43.287
- Except when it seemed like
I was gonna get mugged

37:43.320 --> 37:44.526
and then I ran home fast.

37:44.560 --> 37:47.052
- Hey, let's go for breakfast.

37:47.090 --> 37:48.728
We've never done that.

37:48.760 --> 37:52.196
Let's just go for a big, fat,
greasy, pork, human breakfast.

37:52.230 --> 37:53.891
- That sounds really good.
- I know.

37:53.930 --> 37:55.739
- I have to go let Nora out.

37:55.770 --> 37:57.636
- Right.

38:00.610 --> 38:03.739
- And ask her to marry me.

38:07.110 --> 38:08.316
- Today?
- Definitely.

38:08.350 --> 38:09.772
- Like right now?

38:09.820 --> 38:12.209
- Yeah, I mean, I don't have
a ring or anything,

38:12.250 --> 38:13.809
but I think, like,

38:13.850 --> 38:16.854
a full-on, down-on-one-knee-
proposal with the velvet box

38:16.890 --> 38:18.824
might freak her out,
because, you know,

38:18.860 --> 38:20.988
we've never actually
talked about it, so...

38:21.030 --> 38:23.624
- Josh, do not propose
to Nora this morning.

38:23.660 --> 38:25.822
She will punch
you in the nuts.

38:25.870 --> 38:27.190
- I know it sounds crazy.

38:27.230 --> 38:28.834
- It is crazy.
- It's symbolic.

38:28.870 --> 38:32.602
It's "I--I love you
for what you are.

38:32.640 --> 38:34.779
<i>"I don't care
about the wolf."</i>

38:34.810 --> 38:37.871
- Josh, no woman
wants to be proposed to

38:37.910 --> 38:40.572
after being
a werewolf all night.

38:40.610 --> 38:41.918
This is gonna
be your story?

38:41.950 --> 38:44.510
This is what she's gonna
tell her grandkids?

38:44.550 --> 38:47.520
"Josh proposed while I was
naked and beat-up looking

38:47.550 --> 38:50.087
"with a little bit of
my feces smeared on me."

38:50.120 --> 38:52.487
- I'll stay flexible.

38:52.530 --> 38:54.658
- Dude, don't.

38:54.700 --> 38:58.568
- I spent all night last night
looking at the full moon,

38:58.600 --> 38:59.920
thinking to myself:

38:59.970 --> 39:03.429
"Oh my God. I'm so lucky
I got my life back."

39:03.470 --> 39:05.939
I have Nora. I don't
mop urine anymore.

39:05.970 --> 39:10.009
There are no guarantees when
you enter into a marriage.

39:10.040 --> 39:11.474
But at a certain point,

39:11.510 --> 39:14.878
you just have to leap
and deal with what comes.

39:14.920 --> 39:17.378
(Siren approaching)

39:24.990 --> 39:26.879
Sally?

39:37.600 --> 39:39.534
- Josh, that's Trent.

39:40.340 --> 39:42.035
- Oh my God!

39:42.080 --> 39:45.050
Is this because you
zombie-screwed him?

39:45.080 --> 39:46.377
- I didn't touch him!

39:46.410 --> 39:48.947
I mean, we--we kissed.

39:48.980 --> 39:51.176
He said he was
feeling sick.

39:51.990 --> 39:54.015
He could've had
a heart attack.

39:54.050 --> 39:55.449
He-- An aneurism.

39:55.490 --> 39:57.857
He could've--
Alcohol poisoning.

39:57.890 --> 40:01.087
- Sally. Sally, this is
what Donna was warning us about.

40:01.130 --> 40:02.620
- No.

40:02.660 --> 40:04.924
- This is why you can't
see anybody from your past.

40:04.970 --> 40:05.960
(Siren)

40:06.970 --> 40:08.699
They die.

40:11.610 --> 40:14.875
- Emma? Emmal!

40:14.910 --> 40:17.470
(Children shouting, dog barking)

40:17.510 --> 40:19.649
- I let her go.
I set her free.

40:19.680 --> 40:21.876
- Tell me where she is!
- It's too late.

40:21.920 --> 40:23.718
Because even
if you found her

40:23.750 --> 40:26.139
how could you know
she wasn't exposed?

40:26.190 --> 40:28.147
- Son of a bitch!
What's wrong with you?

40:28.190 --> 40:31.353
- You can't keep a human being
pent up like some animal,

40:31.390 --> 40:33.154
cut off from
everything she loves,

40:33.190 --> 40:36.091
not allowed to take
a free breath outside.

40:36.130 --> 40:37.291
- Can't?

40:37.330 --> 40:39.059
(Groaning)

40:39.100 --> 40:40.920
I did.

40:40.970 --> 40:42.961
(Exhales sharply)

40:43.000 --> 40:44.866
Do you wanna die?

40:44.910 --> 40:48.107
Is this some kind of death wish
because of how you lost Suren?

40:48.140 --> 40:50.234
(Bird chirping)

40:50.280 --> 40:51.941
(Sighing)

40:52.950 --> 40:54.179
(Scoffs)

40:54.210 --> 40:55.746
- Henry, just wait.

40:55.780 --> 40:58.613
You know, underground,
it was weeks,

40:58.650 --> 41:00.789
I don't know,
maybe months,

41:00.820 --> 41:03.755
all I could think
about was revenge.

41:03.790 --> 41:07.124
Baroque, detailed plans,
great plans,

41:07.160 --> 41:11.666
about how I would torment and
eventually kill Mother.

41:11.700 --> 41:14.192
Sounds wrong? That's how
we were trained.

41:14.230 --> 41:18.531
But all I accomplished was
to make myself more angry,

41:18.570 --> 41:22.734
until I was insane
with rage, quilt,

41:22.780 --> 41:25.977
trying to pull
my own eyes out.

41:26.010 --> 41:28.547
But then I started
to dry up

41:28.580 --> 41:31.470
from that year
of binging on life,

41:31.520 --> 41:33.784
a year of killing.

41:33.820 --> 41:36.357
I started to
hallucinate

41:36.390 --> 41:37.983
about Josh and Sally,

41:38.020 --> 41:40.682
about the life that
I was trying to build

41:40.730 --> 41:42.528
before Mother came back.

41:43.730 --> 41:47.189
Henry, Mother's dead.

41:47.230 --> 41:50.291
So what have I got?

41:55.910 --> 41:59.346
All those people
that we killed,

41:59.380 --> 42:00.870
that we used...

42:01.650 --> 42:03.618
I can't live the
way that I did

42:03.650 --> 42:05.880
for the year before
I went to ground.

42:05.920 --> 42:08.139
- You can't make
that choice for me.

42:08.190 --> 42:09.919
- I know. You're
right, I can't.

42:09.960 --> 42:12.554
But you are better
than that, Henry.

42:12.590 --> 42:13.853
I know you are.

42:13.890 --> 42:15.198
We can make this work,

42:15.230 --> 42:17.494
because you're a
survivor and so am I.

42:17.530 --> 42:19.965
- We're not gonna
survive this.

42:25.570 --> 42:30.804
* I climbed too high

42:32.650 --> 42:34.072
- Nora?

42:34.110 --> 42:36.647
* I thought that
I could find a place *

42:36.680 --> 42:38.887
Oh no. Nora!

42:41.690 --> 42:44.955
* 1 ran too far

42:48.830 --> 42:52.619
* I thought that
I could run away *3*

42:54.700 --> 42:58.807
(Man and woman vocalizing)
