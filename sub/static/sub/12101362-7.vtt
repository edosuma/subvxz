WEBVTT

00:05.048 --> 00:06.745
<i>Previously on</i> Dynasty...

00:06.789 --> 00:08.573
-I respect what you are
doing at Fallon Unlimited,

00:08.617 --> 00:11.315
and I want to stay around
and help you make your company

00:11.359 --> 00:12.664
into something
even greater.

00:12.708 --> 00:14.623
They don't treat me
like a Carrington,

00:14.666 --> 00:15.711
and I deserve

00:15.754 --> 00:17.060
to be acknowledged

00:17.104 --> 00:18.801
<i>as part of the family.</i>

00:18.844 --> 00:21.804
Why is a new multimillionaire
like yourself still in Atlanta?

00:21.847 --> 00:24.894
This whole "being rich" thing
kind of freaks me out.

00:24.937 --> 00:27.810
I'm gonna control that hospital
and everything in it,

00:27.853 --> 00:29.812
which means
that Fallon and Blake,

00:29.855 --> 00:32.858
they won't be the only two in
this family that people respect.

01:04.542 --> 01:07.197
Time to rise and shine,
almost-birthday boy.

01:07.241 --> 01:08.851
I made your favorite breakfast.

01:08.894 --> 01:10.853
Okay, I didn't
personally make it,

01:10.896 --> 01:12.202
but I told the chef what to do.

01:12.246 --> 01:14.161
Come on, wakey-wakey,
we got things to discuss.

01:15.597 --> 01:17.120
-Ugh.
-Fine by me.

01:17.164 --> 01:18.817
You talk, I'll eat.

01:18.861 --> 01:20.602
Kirby, in my son's bed.

01:20.645 --> 01:21.820
What a most
unpleasant surprise.

01:21.864 --> 01:23.126
It's like the time
I found a rat

01:23.170 --> 01:24.954
in the loft, but worse.

01:24.997 --> 01:26.173
Mother?

01:26.216 --> 01:27.609
There you are.
I thought we could discuss

01:27.652 --> 01:29.741
your special day
over Belgian waffles

01:29.785 --> 01:31.221
and Virginia ham.

01:31.265 --> 01:33.745
Sounds great and smells
even better. Thank you.

01:33.789 --> 01:35.007
-You are welcome.
-Ooh.

01:35.051 --> 01:37.140
Now...

01:37.184 --> 01:39.316
what kind of plans
would you like to make

01:39.360 --> 01:40.448
for your birthday?

01:40.491 --> 01:41.492
<i>Un voyage en France?</i>

01:41.536 --> 01:42.667
Just the two of us.

01:42.711 --> 01:44.060
Aw.

01:44.104 --> 01:45.844
That's really sweet
and borderline creepy,

01:45.888 --> 01:48.499
but actually his girlfriend's
planning a little party.

01:48.543 --> 01:49.674
Who is?
She is?

01:49.718 --> 01:51.502
Me, and yeah.

01:51.546 --> 01:53.504
It was supposed
to be a surprise.

01:53.548 --> 01:54.723
Just a little, uh,

01:54.766 --> 01:55.985
<i>soirée</i> at La Mirage

01:56.028 --> 01:57.682
with our closest friends.

01:57.726 --> 01:58.857
No family.

01:58.901 --> 02:01.643
Oh, wow. I had no idea you were

02:01.686 --> 02:03.166
going to
so much trouble.

02:03.210 --> 02:04.863
Sorry, Mother, it looks like
I have plans on my birthday,

02:04.907 --> 02:06.909
but maybe we can
celebrate some other time?

02:07.692 --> 02:10.217
Of course. Ah.

02:11.348 --> 02:13.045
We'll just schedule it later.

02:13.089 --> 02:14.525
Mm-hmm.

02:14.569 --> 02:15.961
But thanks for breakfast.

02:25.014 --> 02:27.103
20 acres
in the Scottish countryside.

02:27.147 --> 02:28.583
It's the perfect
place to build

02:28.626 --> 02:30.237
our European base
of operations.

02:30.280 --> 02:32.543
It's close to London,
so its property value

02:32.587 --> 02:34.023
will only increase.

02:34.066 --> 02:35.894
Plus, I love <i>Wuthering Heights.</i>

02:35.938 --> 02:37.766
When are the bids due?

02:37.809 --> 02:39.855
Uh, end of business,
two days from now.

02:39.898 --> 02:41.944
End of business here
or in the U.K.?There,

02:41.987 --> 02:43.293
which means I'll barely have
any time to review

02:43.337 --> 02:44.947
the deed or the covenants.

02:44.990 --> 02:46.514
Plus, I have to talk
to the U.K. appraiser,

02:46.557 --> 02:49.081
who's gonna use British words
I've never heard before.

02:49.125 --> 02:52.259
And this is only half
of my cost analysis.

02:52.302 --> 02:54.217
There are at least
seven other bidders.

02:54.261 --> 02:56.088
I'll call some people
I know over there about comps

02:56.132 --> 02:58.613
and we can finish
the cost analysis later.

02:59.396 --> 03:01.050
-Morning.

03:01.093 --> 03:03.400
Missed you at breakfast, so
I brought you Mrs. Gunnerson's

03:03.444 --> 03:05.097
famous banana bread.

03:05.141 --> 03:07.752
Oh, God, I miss
-Gunnerson's breakfasts.
Hi.

03:07.796 --> 03:11.147
Oh, you shouldn't have.

03:11.191 --> 03:13.105
But because you did,
you should know that I prefer

03:13.149 --> 03:14.411
her chocolate-chip croissants

03:14.455 --> 03:15.891
with a little dollop
of whipped butter.

03:15.934 --> 03:17.458
You're welcome.

03:17.501 --> 03:20.852
Can I also book you for
an early lunch, just to bounce

03:20.896 --> 03:22.158
some article ideas off you?

03:22.202 --> 03:24.421
Um...

03:24.465 --> 03:26.249
You know, I would love
to hear your ideas,

03:26.293 --> 03:28.295
but we're kind of
working on a deadline,

03:28.338 --> 03:30.122
so maybe you could
phone a friend?

03:30.166 --> 03:32.429
Theo's at a conference,
Nash is on assignment,

03:32.473 --> 03:33.604
Andrew's got a new baby.

03:33.648 --> 03:34.605
But, uh, no worries.

03:34.649 --> 03:35.954
I can see you're busy.

03:35.998 --> 03:37.434
I'll just,
I'll see you tonight. Okay?

03:37.478 --> 03:39.001
Okay.

03:39.828 --> 03:41.264
Blake.
Liam.

03:42.047 --> 03:44.528
-What?
-He brings you breakfast,
he wants to have lunch.

03:44.572 --> 03:47.314
You know, too much togetherness
is not good for a marriage.

03:47.357 --> 03:48.793
Or a business.

03:48.837 --> 03:50.926
Okay, well, we have been
married for two months.

03:50.969 --> 03:52.406
That's why they call it
the honeymoon phase.

03:52.449 --> 03:53.711
We still like each other.

03:53.755 --> 03:55.931
That's great,
I'm just warning you.

03:55.974 --> 03:57.976
The work-life balance
is hard to manage.

03:58.020 --> 04:00.022
You know, usually
one of them suffers.

04:00.065 --> 04:00.936
Or both.

04:00.979 --> 04:03.068
I was Alexis's whole world,

04:03.112 --> 04:04.809
and you saw how well
that worked out.

04:04.853 --> 04:06.855
Please. I'm not you.

04:06.898 --> 04:09.031
And Liam is not Alexis.

04:09.074 --> 04:11.207
He respects boundaries.

04:11.251 --> 04:13.470
Hey, you know what? I'll just
hang out by Martina's desk

04:13.514 --> 04:16.038
until you guys are done.

04:17.344 --> 04:19.215
Take your time.

04:20.782 --> 04:22.914
See how wrong you were?

04:22.958 --> 04:24.916
He said I could take my time.

04:24.960 --> 04:26.657
No, seriously, have a sip,
because I'm curious

04:26.701 --> 04:28.703
if you were trying
to make it taste like sewage.

04:30.270 --> 04:31.749
Hello, Alexis.

04:31.793 --> 04:32.837
You really miss this place,
don't you?

04:32.881 --> 04:34.056
I'm here to see Kirby.

04:34.099 --> 04:35.666
You will find her upstairs,

04:35.710 --> 04:38.147
third door on the right,
under my son.

04:38.190 --> 04:40.845
Or I could come back
at another time.

04:40.889 --> 04:43.108
This is getting
way too serious, Anders.

04:43.152 --> 04:45.459
At first I thought
this was just a fling,

04:45.502 --> 04:47.852
but the fact that they're
still together concerns me.

04:47.896 --> 04:51.465
I promised Kirby that I wouldn't
interfere in her personal life.

04:51.508 --> 04:52.988
I'm not asking you to.

04:53.031 --> 04:55.251
Adam wants to be chief of staff
at the hospital.

04:55.295 --> 04:58.559
He needs to focus on his career
and not your wayward daughter.

04:58.602 --> 05:01.344
I believe Kirby would be
better off apart from your son.

05:01.388 --> 05:04.434
We both know that's not going
to happen without an act of God.

05:04.478 --> 05:08.351
Or an act of Alexis,
which is equally as powerful.

05:08.395 --> 05:09.657
Just don't interfere

05:09.700 --> 05:10.919
with me either,

05:10.962 --> 05:12.486
and we will both get
what we want.

05:14.226 --> 05:15.924
Coffee?

05:18.579 --> 05:20.624
Would you like to start
the evening with craft cocktails

05:20.668 --> 05:22.017
or a selection of fine wines?

05:22.060 --> 05:23.845
She just keeps butting
into our lives.

05:23.888 --> 05:25.237
Once we lock in a party menu,

05:25.281 --> 05:26.978
you can talk about Alexis
all you want.

05:27.022 --> 05:28.806
This is more than
just a birthday party,

05:28.850 --> 05:30.155
this is our coming out
as a couple.

05:30.199 --> 05:31.896
Everything has to go perfectly.

05:31.940 --> 05:33.768
Which is why I think wine
is a better choice.

05:33.811 --> 05:36.248
This is one of the two
most serious relationships
I've ever had.

05:36.292 --> 05:37.859
I can't blow it
with a crappy party.

05:37.902 --> 05:40.296
Then pick out a menu.

05:40.340 --> 05:41.428
Sam Jones?

05:41.471 --> 05:43.125
-Yes.
-Special delivery.

05:43.168 --> 05:45.388
Thank you.
Ooh, fancy.

05:49.044 --> 05:51.089
Wow! These are amazing.

05:51.133 --> 05:52.700
Why didn't you tell me
invites were going out?

05:52.743 --> 05:55.485
'Cause I didn't send that.

05:55.529 --> 05:57.531
"Your presence is requested
at a birthday party

05:57.574 --> 06:00.142
"in honor
of Adam Alexander Carrington.

06:00.185 --> 06:01.970
"Saturday evening,
Carrington Manor.

06:02.013 --> 06:03.754
Given with love by his mother"?

06:03.798 --> 06:06.496
She's planning a party
the same night as my party.

06:06.540 --> 06:07.932
Seems like it.

06:07.976 --> 06:09.847
You know how mothers are
with their son's girlfriend.

06:09.891 --> 06:11.719
And with Alexis,

06:11.762 --> 06:13.329
you can multiply that by ten.

06:14.417 --> 06:15.505
Well, wait...

06:21.946 --> 06:23.078
Honey, I'm home.

06:23.121 --> 06:24.819
Hey. What are you doing here?

06:24.862 --> 06:26.124
Well, I thought

06:26.168 --> 06:27.691
you and I could grab
a quick bite,

06:27.735 --> 06:29.432
and then you could tell me
some of your article ideas.

06:29.476 --> 06:31.521
I wish I could, but I actually
already made plans.

06:31.565 --> 06:34.002
-What? With who?
-With me.

06:34.045 --> 06:35.482
Nash Martinez.

06:36.308 --> 06:38.789
Oh. Hi. Fallon Carrington.

06:38.833 --> 06:40.443
Nash and I were in the same
writing program in college.

06:40.487 --> 06:42.663
He's an award-winning,
globe-trotting journalist.

06:42.706 --> 06:44.969
Who would, frankly, prefer
to take a break from trotting.

06:45.013 --> 06:46.623
Anyway, I'm
doing a piece

06:46.667 --> 06:48.451
that brought me through Atlanta,
so naturally I called Liam.

06:48.495 --> 06:49.887
So we're gonna hang out
for a couple days.

06:49.931 --> 06:51.323
Um, I already
gave him the tour

06:51.367 --> 06:53.456
and told him he could stay here,
if that's okay.

06:53.500 --> 06:54.849
Of course.

06:54.892 --> 06:56.590
That's amazing, because
I'm so sick of hotel living.

06:56.633 --> 06:58.200
W-Well, perfect.

06:58.243 --> 07:00.463
Uh, let me grab you another
drink while you two chat.

07:00.507 --> 07:01.551
South Side?

07:01.595 --> 07:02.639
Sure.
Extra mint?

07:02.683 --> 07:04.336
Yep.

07:06.687 --> 07:08.340
How'd I do?

07:08.384 --> 07:11.518
Perfect. And thank you so much
for coming on such short notice.

07:11.561 --> 07:14.695
No problem, I haven't seen Liam
in a while. I'm glad you called.

07:14.738 --> 07:17.001
Yeah, although, you know,
as far as Liam knows,

07:17.045 --> 07:18.481
I did not call,
there was no call.

07:18.525 --> 07:20.918
Yes, yeah.
Your secret's safe with me.

07:20.962 --> 07:23.181
Good, because if Liam finds out
that I brought you here

07:23.225 --> 07:25.314
just so I can get
a little bit of work done,

07:25.357 --> 07:27.316
he'd probably want
a trial separation.

07:27.359 --> 07:29.536
Or something more permanent.

07:54.865 --> 07:56.388
Thank you for meeting me.

07:56.432 --> 07:57.912
I'm here more out of curiosity

07:57.955 --> 07:59.522
than anything else,
so get to it.

07:59.566 --> 08:03.483
Well, first, again, I am sorry
for the loss of your mother.

08:04.658 --> 08:06.877
While I was at the reception
I overheard you talking about

08:06.921 --> 08:09.532
how you always felt
rejected by the Carringtons.

08:09.576 --> 08:10.664
And this is news to you?

08:10.707 --> 08:11.926
It was the first time
I'd ever heard you

08:11.969 --> 08:13.493
express it
to someone besides me.

08:13.536 --> 08:16.931
And made me realize,
my family has mistreated you.

08:16.974 --> 08:18.628
My father, and, yeah,

08:18.672 --> 08:20.412
to some extent, me.

08:20.456 --> 08:22.110
Don't be so hard on yourself.

08:22.153 --> 08:23.546
Dominique, I'm trying
to make amends here, okay?

08:23.590 --> 08:25.548
And I appreciate it.

08:25.592 --> 08:28.769
I'm just not sure why you had me
come across town to hear it.

08:28.812 --> 08:30.248
Because there's something else.

08:31.206 --> 08:33.077
There aren't any diamonds
on or under

08:33.121 --> 08:34.688
the grounds of Carrington Manor.

08:34.731 --> 08:36.516
Says who?
My father.

08:37.647 --> 08:39.214
He told me a long time ago
that he had had

08:39.257 --> 08:41.216
surveys done because
of all the diamond rumors,

08:41.259 --> 08:43.087
and they didn't
find anything.

08:43.131 --> 08:44.741
I don't know why Thomas
left you the rights,

08:44.785 --> 08:46.047
but they're worthless.

08:46.090 --> 08:50.007
So you call me here
to make amends,

08:50.051 --> 08:53.228
and then you tell me the one
thing I've been counting on

08:53.271 --> 08:55.535
is a complete lie?

08:55.578 --> 08:56.971
And now, after
everything

08:57.014 --> 08:58.581
you've put me through,
I'm supposed to believe you?

08:58.625 --> 09:01.541
I know. And I'm sorry.

09:01.584 --> 09:03.151
But I have an idea
that could help.

09:04.065 --> 09:05.545
If you just hear me out.

09:09.418 --> 09:11.986
Nice try, Alexis.

09:13.204 --> 09:16.730
And consider this my
I won't be there.

09:18.383 --> 09:20.995
That works out well,
considering you weren't invited.

09:21.038 --> 09:24.389
You did all this
just to interfere with my party?

09:24.433 --> 09:25.565
You bitch.

09:25.608 --> 09:27.610
If I am, take a lesson from me.

09:27.654 --> 09:29.090
You might need it in life.

09:29.133 --> 09:30.744
Do you even care about
what Adam wants?

09:30.787 --> 09:32.397
It's all I care about.

09:32.441 --> 09:33.964
It's why I'm doing this.
For him.

09:34.008 --> 09:35.749
What, you think he's gonna
spend the rest of his life

09:35.792 --> 09:37.402
living with his mother?

09:37.446 --> 09:41.015
Adam will come to his senses
once he realizes dating the help

09:41.058 --> 09:42.886
isn't doing him
any favors.

09:42.930 --> 09:44.888
Neither is dating his mother.

09:44.932 --> 09:46.498
You've had it out
for me ever since

09:46.542 --> 09:48.239
I moved in here
when I was 12.

09:48.283 --> 09:51.852
And now you just can't stand
the fact that your son

09:51.895 --> 09:54.028
chose the butler's daughter.

09:55.072 --> 09:56.073
Adam will choose me.

09:56.117 --> 09:57.205
And my party.

09:57.248 --> 09:59.599
He will make the right choice.

09:59.642 --> 10:01.252
I have no doubt.

10:01.296 --> 10:03.211
Mm.

10:03.254 --> 10:04.734
<i>I think you need</i>

10:04.778 --> 10:07.258
to cancel your party.

10:07.302 --> 10:08.782
Hmm.

10:08.825 --> 10:10.697
You don't need to compete
with Kirby for my attention.

10:10.740 --> 10:12.437
Don't insult me.
It's not a competition.

10:12.481 --> 10:13.700
It's my gift to you.

10:13.743 --> 10:15.179
Okay. Sorry.
Maybe I misunderstood,

10:15.223 --> 10:16.441
but Kirby's upset.

10:16.485 --> 10:18.748
I need you to call
off your party.

10:18.792 --> 10:20.358
You-you knew she was
planning something.

10:20.402 --> 10:22.883
Fine. If that's what
you really want, I will call

10:22.926 --> 10:25.537
everyone on the guest list
and tell them it's off.

10:25.581 --> 10:26.669
Thank you, Mother.

10:26.713 --> 10:28.018
Including the hospital board.

10:28.062 --> 10:30.107
I even invited
Mrs. Scarborough.

10:30.151 --> 10:32.806
And she rarely leaves
the house these days.

10:32.849 --> 10:34.764
And she's the board member
with the most influence.

10:34.808 --> 10:36.766
I just thought
it would be nice

10:36.810 --> 10:39.203
for her to hear about your
desire to be chief of staff.

10:39.247 --> 10:41.118
Has she RSVP'd yet?

10:41.162 --> 10:44.165
She's coming. Or she was
until you asked me to cancel.

10:44.208 --> 10:45.862
Let me see if I can find

10:45.906 --> 10:47.777
her number.
Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, don't.

10:47.821 --> 10:49.692
Don't call anyone yet.

10:49.736 --> 10:51.259
I'll talk to Kirby.

10:51.302 --> 10:53.478
And I'll convince her
to come to your party.

10:53.522 --> 10:55.306
Of course.

10:55.350 --> 10:56.917
Kirby is more than welcome.

10:56.960 --> 10:58.222
Though...

10:58.266 --> 11:00.921
if you really want
to restore your reputation

11:00.964 --> 11:03.793
and make a good impression
on the board,

11:03.837 --> 11:05.969
is bringing the girl
that you humped

11:06.013 --> 11:08.537
in the supply closet
the smartest move?

11:13.847 --> 11:15.500
Excuse me, is this

11:15.544 --> 11:18.678
where the cocktail party is
for the charity underwriters?

11:18.721 --> 11:19.983
Yep. Starts in an hour.

11:20.027 --> 11:22.899
Ah, I must have read
the time wrong.

11:22.943 --> 11:25.380
Can you take that chafing dish
over to that table?

11:25.423 --> 11:27.208
Thanks.

11:27.251 --> 11:30.254
Uh... sure...

11:45.748 --> 11:46.836
Remember, no pictures
tonight, guys.

11:46.880 --> 11:48.708
Rich people don't like

11:48.751 --> 11:50.579
their photos splashed online

11:50.622 --> 11:52.146
without approval.

11:52.189 --> 11:54.931
Hey, I was just checking
my email for the party details.

11:54.975 --> 11:57.151
I think I got
the start time mixed up.

11:57.194 --> 12:00.284
I'm, um,...In the right place. I'm Mia.

12:00.328 --> 12:02.896
Representative for
One City One Voice.

12:02.939 --> 12:05.202
I know you're volunteering,
but I like all my volunteers

12:05.246 --> 12:07.248
to treat events
like a paying job.

12:07.291 --> 12:10.207
Even though, to be clear,
you will not be getting paid.

12:10.251 --> 12:12.862
Oh, no, I'm, uh...

12:14.690 --> 12:17.084
...dressed like everyone else.

12:17.127 --> 12:19.564
You can start
by dealing with the ice.

12:19.608 --> 12:21.566
Thanks.

12:21.610 --> 12:22.872
And bend your knees
when you lift.

12:26.136 --> 12:28.660
By the way, what was your name?

12:29.444 --> 12:30.880
Mike.

12:30.924 --> 12:33.404
Good for you
to volunteer at your...

12:33.448 --> 12:34.579
Age?

12:34.623 --> 12:36.233
Ah!

12:36.277 --> 12:39.019
No problem.

12:40.585 --> 12:43.501
Martina?

12:43.545 --> 12:45.634
Where are those comps?
I need them before my call.

12:45.677 --> 12:48.419
I put them at the top
of your inbox 20 minutes ago.

12:48.463 --> 12:50.944
Oh. You did.

12:50.987 --> 12:52.728
I'm sorry.

12:52.772 --> 12:54.382
I'm so used to Allison
messing things up.

12:54.425 --> 12:56.427
Your competence is
really throwing me off.

12:56.471 --> 12:58.038
I apologize.

12:58.081 --> 13:00.083
All the numbers you need
for the appraiser

13:00.127 --> 13:01.389
are right there.

13:01.432 --> 13:02.912
Hey, ladies!

13:02.956 --> 13:04.740
It is karaoke night!

13:04.784 --> 13:07.525
Old college tradition.
Aw!

13:07.569 --> 13:09.919
How cute! You guys have fun.

13:09.963 --> 13:11.442
Sing a Whitney Houston
power ballad for me,

13:11.486 --> 13:13.053
and then tell me all about it
in the morning.

13:13.096 --> 13:15.795
What? No, you're
coming with us.

13:15.838 --> 13:17.361
-We got a private room.
-Liam.

13:17.405 --> 13:19.886
I can't come, okay? I have
a very, very important call

13:19.929 --> 13:22.627
tonight, and, besides, I would
feel like a third wheel.

13:22.671 --> 13:24.804
But it's past quitting time.
You shouldn't be here this late.

13:24.847 --> 13:26.327
Well, I'm-I'm a workaholic,

13:26.370 --> 13:29.504
so I get it.
No, I'm-I'm not
a workaholic, Nash.

13:29.547 --> 13:31.114
I'm a worker, you know?

13:31.158 --> 13:33.421
And I can't run a company
on bankers' hours.

13:33.464 --> 13:34.814
Or writers' hours.

13:34.857 --> 13:36.337
A little break won't hurt,
huh?

13:36.380 --> 13:38.818
Actually I could wait
for the call and postpone it

13:38.861 --> 13:40.167
until you get home.

13:40.210 --> 13:41.777
I'll tell them you had
a last-minute emergency.

13:41.821 --> 13:43.300
There we go, problem solved!
Thank you, Martina.

13:43.344 --> 13:44.867
Come on, okay?

13:44.911 --> 13:46.782
I don't want Nash to think
that my new wife

13:46.826 --> 13:48.262
loves work
more than she loves me.

13:51.482 --> 13:52.875
Okay, yeah.

13:52.919 --> 13:54.355
There we go.

13:54.398 --> 13:56.574
You know, sometimes

13:56.618 --> 13:58.750
being so good at your job

13:58.794 --> 14:00.709
is not the best thing
in the world.

14:07.411 --> 14:09.805
Why am I getting flowers when
it's about to be your birthday?

14:09.849 --> 14:11.720
Because I think
you're wonderful.

14:13.896 --> 14:16.725
And I had a long conversation
with Alexis

14:16.768 --> 14:19.859
about this whole
dueling parties situation.

14:19.902 --> 14:22.862
Right, so the flowers are
a consolation prize,

14:22.905 --> 14:24.211
because clearly
you were too afraid

14:24.254 --> 14:25.603
to tell your mother
to cancel her party.

14:25.647 --> 14:27.910
-No, I told her.
-Mm-hmm.

14:27.954 --> 14:29.477
But then she told me
that she invited

14:29.520 --> 14:31.174
the entire hospital board,

14:31.218 --> 14:33.611
including Mrs. Scarborough,
who you don't know,

14:33.655 --> 14:35.439
but, trust me,
she's really important.

14:35.483 --> 14:37.877
It's all about selling me for
this chief of staff position.

14:37.920 --> 14:39.095
And what about my party?

14:39.139 --> 14:40.357
It's important to me.

14:40.401 --> 14:42.577
It was for us to be seen
as a real couple.

14:42.620 --> 14:44.448
We know we're a real couple.

14:44.492 --> 14:46.494
That's all that matters.

14:47.408 --> 14:48.670
Fine.

14:48.713 --> 14:50.237
I'll cancel my party.

14:52.935 --> 14:55.242
-But you owe me big time.
-Mm-hmm.

14:55.285 --> 14:57.200
And if it really
means that much,

14:57.244 --> 14:58.985
I'll be there
to support you, too.

14:59.028 --> 15:00.943
About that...

15:00.987 --> 15:02.902
Are you kidding?

15:02.945 --> 15:05.034
I'm not invited to
your birthday party?!

15:05.078 --> 15:06.775
Well, it's not
a birthday party.

15:06.818 --> 15:08.429
It's more of a work thing,
but, to be honest,

15:08.472 --> 15:10.213
Alexis is right--
the board doesn't need

15:10.257 --> 15:11.911
to be reminded
about our shenanigans

15:11.954 --> 15:13.260
in the supply closet.

15:13.303 --> 15:15.175
So I have to cancel my party,
and then I can't

15:15.218 --> 15:17.307
come to yours
because you're embarrassed

15:17.351 --> 15:19.048
-of me?
-No, you're putting words
in my mouth now.

15:19.092 --> 15:20.658
Well, your mother's drilling
thoughts into your head.

15:20.702 --> 15:22.312
You and my mother don't
get along, and I don't want

15:22.356 --> 15:24.662
to be spending
the whole night playing referee

15:24.706 --> 15:26.012
between you guys!

15:26.055 --> 15:27.927
Oh, don't worry.
You won't have to.

15:27.970 --> 15:29.580
Here.

15:29.624 --> 15:32.409
Why don't you give these to
the other woman in your life?

15:32.453 --> 15:34.803
Happy birthday, jackass.

15:35.804 --> 15:37.240
<i>Okay,</i>

15:37.284 --> 15:39.503
so find the second-best
sushi chef in Japan

15:39.547 --> 15:42.550
and fly him here.
It's not that hard.

15:42.593 --> 15:43.899
We need to talk.

15:43.943 --> 15:45.031
Seems we always do.

15:45.074 --> 15:46.728
Blake told me

15:46.771 --> 15:48.425
there are
no diamonds underground.

15:48.469 --> 15:50.297
That we're throwing
good money after bad.

15:50.340 --> 15:53.169
And did he offer to buy
the worthless rights from you?

15:53.213 --> 15:55.128
He told me
he'd felt sorry for me

15:55.171 --> 15:56.433
after everything
I'd been through.

15:56.477 --> 15:57.782
Said it was
the least he could do.

15:57.826 --> 16:00.437
Aw, you poor, gullible thing.

16:00.481 --> 16:02.309
I have known Blake
for over 30 years.

16:02.352 --> 16:05.399
The man does not have a
charitable bone in his body.

16:05.442 --> 16:08.968
He is trying to manipulate you
and get you not to trust me.

16:09.011 --> 16:12.406
Please tell me that
you didn't fall for it.

16:12.449 --> 16:14.060
Almost.

16:14.103 --> 16:16.801
I decided to call the
mineralogist to get an update,

16:16.845 --> 16:20.109
and he told me there were no
diamonds here as well, so I had

16:20.153 --> 16:21.981
a background check done.

16:22.024 --> 16:23.983
He used to work
for Carrington Atlantic.

16:24.026 --> 16:25.897
He and Blake go back years.

16:25.941 --> 16:28.422
Hmm, I knew Blake
was playing you.

16:28.465 --> 16:29.901
Playing <i>us.</i>

16:29.945 --> 16:31.773
We need a new mineralogist.

16:31.816 --> 16:33.644
Yes, well, get on that.

16:33.688 --> 16:36.821
And make sure it's someone
who has never worked for Blake.

16:36.865 --> 16:38.214
Can you handle that?

16:38.258 --> 16:40.390
You know what I can't handle?

16:40.434 --> 16:42.305
Your attitude.

16:42.349 --> 16:43.698
Remember...

16:43.741 --> 16:45.482
these rights belong to me.

16:45.526 --> 16:47.919
So you might not want
to bite the hand

16:47.963 --> 16:49.921
that can make you filthy rich.

16:51.097 --> 16:54.143
I bite back.

overrated? ♪

18:37.377 --> 18:41.424

18:41.468 --> 18:45.428

♪ Fall for a shooting star

looking for yourself ♪

19:22.857 --> 19:26.861
♪ Out there.

19:28.863 --> 19:31.953
Okay, I'll do one more.

19:36.697 --> 19:40.135
Mm-hmm, hope you didn't take
any pictures on that thing.

19:40.179 --> 19:42.181
To be fair...

19:42.224 --> 19:43.573
the party is over.

19:43.617 --> 19:45.140
Oh, does that mean
my job is done

19:45.184 --> 19:46.315
when I finish
breaking this bar down?

19:46.359 --> 19:47.577
And we can talk
about something

19:47.621 --> 19:49.188
other than
passed hors d'oeuvres?

19:49.231 --> 19:50.885
We'll see how you are
with cleanup first.

19:50.928 --> 19:52.495
Mm...

19:52.539 --> 19:54.323
I shouldn't have worried
about the photos so much.

19:54.367 --> 19:56.238
They were taking
selfies all night.

19:56.282 --> 19:57.674
Some rich people

19:57.718 --> 19:58.893
only come to these things

19:58.936 --> 20:00.068
just to flex on social media.

20:00.111 --> 20:01.635
Ah...

20:01.678 --> 20:03.376
I'm sure some of them
have good intentions.

20:03.419 --> 20:05.247
Yeah, you're right.

20:05.291 --> 20:07.031
That was unprofessional of me.

20:07.075 --> 20:10.034
Don't get me started or I'll end
up talking your ear off, Mike.

20:10.078 --> 20:12.341
It's okay... I have a spare.

20:12.385 --> 20:15.649
Maybe I'll take
you up on that one day.

20:15.692 --> 20:19.043
But for now I just got to get
home and get these shoes off.

20:19.087 --> 20:21.002
Uh, small perk.

20:21.045 --> 20:22.656
We get to take home

20:22.699 --> 20:24.353
any unopened alcohol.

20:24.397 --> 20:25.963
Think I'll be taking this

20:26.007 --> 20:28.575
as a party favor.

20:30.316 --> 20:33.232
Here you go.

20:35.625 --> 20:38.759
I'm gonna finish
wrapping things up.

20:38.802 --> 20:40.804
Hey, you're...

20:40.848 --> 20:43.198
gonna be at the actual event
next week, right?

20:43.242 --> 20:45.418
Of course.

20:45.461 --> 20:46.767
You know, if you're free,

20:46.810 --> 20:48.812
we could really use
a good bartender.

20:51.424 --> 20:53.077
<i>You were much easier to find</i>

20:53.121 --> 20:54.427
when you lived at the manor.

20:54.470 --> 20:56.167
And you were easier to avoid.

20:56.211 --> 20:57.386
I just thought
you'd like to know

20:57.430 --> 20:58.909
that things are going
as planned.

20:58.953 --> 21:00.955
I thought we agreed
I wasn't getting involved.

21:00.998 --> 21:02.565
You don't have to.

21:02.609 --> 21:05.176
Adam told me that he is not
bringing Kirby to the party now.

21:05.220 --> 21:06.352
My party.

21:06.395 --> 21:07.440
Isn't that wonderful?

21:07.483 --> 21:08.876
It's not the word I would use.

21:08.919 --> 21:10.921
After all, my daughter
does have feelings.

21:10.965 --> 21:13.576
-She'll get over it.
-Well, I suppose if she
got over the last one,

21:13.620 --> 21:15.143
she could get
over Adam.

21:15.186 --> 21:17.363
Oliver made Adam
look like Prince Charming.

21:17.406 --> 21:19.060
I resent that implication.

21:19.103 --> 21:20.409
You should. It wasn't subtle.

21:20.453 --> 21:22.672
Kirby's always had
dreadful taste in men,

21:22.716 --> 21:25.980
a streak she continues
to keep alive.

21:26.023 --> 21:27.242
Now, if you'll excuse me.

21:27.286 --> 21:28.287
There's one more thing.

21:28.330 --> 21:30.463
This is my first
official gala

21:30.506 --> 21:31.768
since I've taken over the manor,

21:31.812 --> 21:33.161
and the who's who
of Atlanta are coming.

21:33.204 --> 21:35.642
I can't risk
anything going wrong.

21:35.685 --> 21:37.296
Which is why I need your help.

21:37.339 --> 21:39.863
I am flattered,
and I don't moonlight.

21:39.907 --> 21:43.824
You owe me for doing your dirty
work and breaking up the kids.

21:44.912 --> 21:46.740
Now it's time for you
to do your part.

21:49.177 --> 21:50.787
<i>I mean, I checked my boot</i>

21:50.831 --> 21:53.007
beforehand, but that scorpion,
it got me right on the heel.

21:53.050 --> 21:54.791
Oh! Ouch.

21:54.835 --> 21:57.272
I spent the entire day
inspecting leaking pipelines

21:57.316 --> 21:59.056
while hopping around
on one foot.

22:00.710 --> 22:03.234
But that article helped the
community see what was going on.

22:03.278 --> 22:04.714
It was pretty impressive.

22:04.758 --> 22:08.109
But living out of a duffel bag
has gotten to be a drag.

22:08.152 --> 22:10.329
Your life looks great to me.

22:11.199 --> 22:13.419
I will cheers to
that, my fr-- ooh.

22:13.462 --> 22:14.985
I'm gonna grab us
another round.

22:15.029 --> 22:17.379
-I'll be back.
-Bye.

22:17.423 --> 22:20.469
So, this has been fun,

22:20.513 --> 22:22.471
but I brought you here
to buy me some time.

22:22.515 --> 22:23.907
I only needed
48 hours.

22:23.951 --> 22:26.170
So now I need you to
occupy Liam alone.

22:26.214 --> 22:27.781
Yeah. I got you, Fallon.

22:27.824 --> 22:28.956
There's just one thing.

22:28.999 --> 22:30.827
What? Whoa.

22:30.871 --> 22:31.872
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

22:33.395 --> 22:34.918
What the hell
do you think you're doing?

22:41.969 --> 22:44.754
Based on the seismic imaging
reports provided to me,

22:44.798 --> 22:46.277
I have serious reservations

22:46.321 --> 22:47.540
about the site of
the current mine.

22:47.583 --> 22:49.411
It seems statistically
significant

22:49.455 --> 22:50.717
to note the lack of...

22:50.760 --> 22:52.675
Could you cut to the chase?

22:52.719 --> 22:54.242
Do we have the stones or not?

22:54.285 --> 22:55.330
There are no diamonds.

22:55.374 --> 22:57.419
What? I know there are diamonds

22:57.463 --> 22:58.420
on this property.

22:58.464 --> 22:59.987
You didn't let me finish.

23:00.030 --> 23:02.642
There are no diamonds where
you're currently digging.

23:02.685 --> 23:06.210
New mines need
to be dug here.

23:06.254 --> 23:07.821
On the other side of the house,

23:07.864 --> 23:10.563
a couple hundred yards away
from the original location.

23:10.606 --> 23:12.260
Thank you
for the dramatic reveal.

23:12.303 --> 23:14.175
Okay. We're done here.

23:14.218 --> 23:15.698
Just tell the crew

23:15.742 --> 23:18.571
to start moving their equipment
where it needs to go.

23:19.441 --> 23:21.312
Too much time and money

23:21.356 --> 23:23.445
have been spent
in this current location.

23:23.489 --> 23:25.404
We could end up
empty-handed

23:25.447 --> 23:26.883
at the new spot as well.

23:26.927 --> 23:29.103
It's too expensive
to keep doing this.

23:29.146 --> 23:30.452
Not if we split the cost.

23:30.496 --> 23:32.628
You can pay for
your half later,

23:32.672 --> 23:34.761
with the money from the sale
of your share of the diamonds.

23:34.804 --> 23:37.154
That's not how this works,
remember?

23:37.198 --> 23:40.244
You finance the dig
and we split the ice.

23:40.288 --> 23:41.463
You can't
renegotiate

23:41.507 --> 23:44.335
the original terms of the deal.

23:44.379 --> 23:45.554
Yes, I can.

23:45.598 --> 23:48.775
Unless you want
Blake to win. Again.

23:51.038 --> 23:54.476
If Alexis thinks I'm trash,
I'll show her trash.

23:54.520 --> 23:56.391
I'm gonna ruin her fancy party.

23:56.435 --> 23:58.872
Yeah, I'm not sure
that's a great idea.

23:58.915 --> 24:01.918
Maybe just watch some <i>Housewives
and eat your feelings?</i>

24:01.962 --> 24:04.094
This isn't for Adam anyway,
it's for her.

24:04.138 --> 24:06.662
She's only using him so
she can weasel her way back in

24:06.706 --> 24:09.056
-with her high society friends.
-All the same,

24:09.099 --> 24:12.015
I'm putting you up in a room and
ordering you some rocky road.

24:12.059 --> 24:13.190
Seems fitting.

24:13.234 --> 24:15.323
I don't want ice cream.

24:15.366 --> 24:17.368
I want respect.

24:17.412 --> 24:18.848
Actually, both would be great.

24:18.892 --> 24:20.371
And you think
this is the way to get it?

24:20.415 --> 24:22.504
Besides,
if you ruin the party,

24:22.548 --> 24:24.506
you will put me
in such an awkward spot.

24:24.550 --> 24:25.986
You're going?

24:26.029 --> 24:27.683
Fallon needs me there
for emotional support.

24:27.727 --> 24:30.077
Apparently Liam's friend
was being creepy last night?

24:30.120 --> 24:31.861
Listen, never mind,

24:31.905 --> 24:34.734
just stay in a suite,
order some room service on me.

24:34.777 --> 24:36.866
And get
some sleep. Okay?

24:36.910 --> 24:40.653
Oh, and, uh,
checkout's at 11:00, FYI.

24:46.441 --> 24:48.312
Everyone ready for the rush?

24:48.356 --> 24:51.838
This crowd is always fashionably
20 minutes late

24:51.881 --> 24:54.057
on the dot. They
arrive en masse.

24:54.101 --> 24:56.886
Now check the salt level
in that ice bath.

24:56.930 --> 25:00.890
Th-The champagne should be
served at exactly 53 degrees.

25:11.074 --> 25:13.424
Attention, everyone.
One final thing.

25:13.468 --> 25:15.470
Everyone be
on high alert

25:15.514 --> 25:17.080
for sabotage by this woman.

25:17.124 --> 25:19.561
Kirby lives upstairs. They
all know what she looks like.

25:19.605 --> 25:21.215
I think you're overreacting.

25:21.258 --> 25:22.825
While she may live here
in the manor,

25:22.869 --> 25:24.697
she is most certainly
not on the guest list.

25:24.740 --> 25:25.915
I want to be alerted

25:25.959 --> 25:28.048
to her presence right away.

25:28.091 --> 25:29.658
Now, back to work.

25:29.702 --> 25:32.748
I don't appreciate you labeling
my daughter as a saboteur.

25:32.792 --> 25:35.229
I can call her worse names
if you would like.

25:35.272 --> 25:36.447
Kirby won't be a problem.

25:36.491 --> 25:37.579
Don't be so sure.

25:37.623 --> 25:38.928
She had her party stolen by me

25:38.972 --> 25:40.930
and was uninvited
to this one by Adam.

25:40.974 --> 25:44.630
If I were her, I would be
hell-bent on making someone pay.

25:49.896 --> 25:52.376
Who are you texting? Everyone
you know is basically here.

25:52.420 --> 25:55.771
I was texting Blake, who is
not here, but I'm done now.

25:55.815 --> 25:57.294
Good, 'cause I got great news.

25:57.338 --> 25:59.427
What, you have a real estate
license in Scotland?

25:59.470 --> 26:02.299
What? No. No, Nash is staying.

26:02.343 --> 26:03.997
He's staying where? Here?

26:04.040 --> 26:06.390
Yeah, in Atlanta. And he wants
to put down some roots

26:06.434 --> 26:07.957
and for the two of us to write
an investigative exposé

26:08.001 --> 26:09.611
about political payoffs
in agribusiness.

26:09.655 --> 26:13.659
Well, I can't wait for you guys
to blow the lid off agriculture.

26:13.702 --> 26:14.964
Well, you can tell him that,
'cause he should,

26:15.008 --> 26:16.618
he should be here any second.

26:16.662 --> 26:19.621
Wait, you invited Nash?
Has he even met Adam?

26:19.665 --> 26:21.667
Well, obviously not,
or he wouldn't have come.

26:22.885 --> 26:25.496
-May I just have a drink, please?
-Sure thing.

26:25.540 --> 26:28.717
Perfect. There he is.

26:31.677 --> 26:35.158
There is no better candidate
for chief of staff than Adam.

26:35.202 --> 26:39.598
He is deeply committed to others
and steadfast in his principles.

26:39.641 --> 26:42.209
And I'm sure she'd be saying
that if she weren't my mother.

26:42.252 --> 26:45.647
Well, I can tell you that
you are on the short list,

26:45.691 --> 26:47.170
Dr. Carrington.

26:47.214 --> 26:49.042
But I can't promise
anything past that.

26:49.085 --> 26:50.913
Oh, sure you can,
Mrs. Scarborough.

26:50.957 --> 26:53.133
It's easy.
Two more glasses of champagne

26:53.176 --> 26:55.875
and you'll be asking him
to take out your gallbladder.

26:57.398 --> 26:59.661
Ah.

26:59.705 --> 27:03.534
Thank you, Mother,
for all of this.

27:03.578 --> 27:05.536
Of course.

27:05.580 --> 27:07.756
What's a mother
for if not to feed

27:07.800 --> 27:10.846
the unchecked ambition
of her children?

27:10.890 --> 27:12.413
Lovely party, Alexis.

27:12.456 --> 27:15.634
Oh, this? It's just a little
something I threw together.

27:20.160 --> 27:23.337
Keep working the room,
-be charming.
-Mm-hmm.

27:23.380 --> 27:25.818
Just remember, none of this
would be happening

27:25.861 --> 27:28.690
if it was Kirby's
sad little party.

27:31.911 --> 27:34.391
Ah. Did Liam tell
you the good news?

27:34.435 --> 27:36.437
No, he told me you were

27:36.480 --> 27:38.091
-moving to Atlanta.
-That's cute.

27:38.134 --> 27:41.224
Liam is very excited
to be working with you.

27:41.268 --> 27:43.705
Which is why I'm willing
to chalk up

27:43.749 --> 27:45.446
what happened at karaoke

27:45.489 --> 27:47.013
as a momentary indiscretion.

27:47.056 --> 27:48.710
You can't blame a guy
for trying.

27:48.754 --> 27:50.538
I'm pretty sure I can, and do.

27:50.581 --> 27:53.584
I understand. You're not ready
to sleep with me yet.

27:53.628 --> 27:55.195
Can you hear yourself talk?

27:55.238 --> 27:57.501
In the meantime,
I'll take a consolation prize.

27:57.545 --> 28:00.156
A series of articles in
your biggest magazine.

28:00.200 --> 28:02.115
A lifestyle series,
something I can write

28:02.158 --> 28:03.856
from the comfort
of my new couch.

28:03.899 --> 28:05.684
And what about the exposé
with Liam?

28:05.727 --> 28:07.598
I'll get to that. One day.

28:07.642 --> 28:09.078
We are done here.

28:09.122 --> 28:10.819
I am not giving you a thing.

28:10.863 --> 28:12.603
You may see yourself out

28:12.647 --> 28:14.127
and be very, very grateful

28:14.170 --> 28:15.911
that I'm not gonna tell
your friend what a jerk you are.

28:15.955 --> 28:18.827
Go ahead. And I'll tell Liam
how you begged me

28:18.871 --> 28:20.611
to come take him off your hands.

28:20.655 --> 28:21.917
Two months married,

28:21.961 --> 28:23.614
and you're already lying
to get rid of him.

28:23.658 --> 28:25.138
I'm sure he'll
love that.

28:25.181 --> 28:27.793
I suppose the honeymoon phase
is over.

28:41.807 --> 28:44.418
Ah. Excuse me just a moment.

28:44.461 --> 28:45.593
Okay.

28:47.203 --> 28:49.379
Can't you see
I'm celebrating my son?

28:49.423 --> 28:51.468
Well, here's something else
for you to celebrate.

28:51.512 --> 28:52.731
What's this?

28:52.774 --> 28:54.558
The discovery
from our new dig.

28:54.602 --> 28:57.823
That's it? You pulled me away
from a society reporter

28:57.866 --> 28:59.172
to drop pebbles in my hand?

28:59.215 --> 29:01.652
They're raw diamonds, you fool.

29:01.696 --> 29:03.132
According to the
mineralogist,

29:03.176 --> 29:06.135
these are just the tip
of the diamond iceberg.

29:06.179 --> 29:09.965
She expects bigger pieces
the deeper we dig.

29:10.009 --> 29:12.141
We've hit the mother lode.

29:15.449 --> 29:16.667
Adam's birthday,

29:16.711 --> 29:17.930
and you didn't invite me?

29:17.973 --> 29:19.453
So very classy of you, Alexis.

29:19.496 --> 29:22.761
Well, you're here now, and
just in time to hear the news.

29:23.936 --> 29:27.156
Diamonds found here on the
grounds at Carrington Manor.

29:27.200 --> 29:29.724
Exactly the opposite
of what you told me.

29:29.768 --> 29:31.944
I don't know what
you're talking about.

29:32.945 --> 29:34.381
I know the two of you
deserve each other.

29:34.424 --> 29:35.730
You used my mother's death

29:35.774 --> 29:37.776
to cheat me out
of my birthright.

29:37.819 --> 29:40.779
-You're shameless.
-You know what, Dominique?

29:40.822 --> 29:43.477
It doesn't matter how much money
you end up with.

29:43.520 --> 29:45.392
You'll never be
a true Carrington.

29:49.048 --> 29:51.398
She's beautiful. She's funny.

29:51.441 --> 29:52.791
She thinks you're a volunteer,

29:52.834 --> 29:54.705
not Atlanta's
most eligible bachelor.

29:54.749 --> 29:58.579
True, but I felt a spark with
her I haven't felt in a while.

29:58.622 --> 30:00.886
So you never actually
attended the party as a donor?

30:00.929 --> 30:02.452
You just worked the whole time?

30:02.496 --> 30:04.150
I stayed behind the scenes.

30:04.193 --> 30:06.761
And I don't fit in with any of
the other underwriters anyway.

30:06.805 --> 30:09.329
And she hates rich people,

30:09.372 --> 30:11.418
so I don't know what to do
about telling her who I am.

30:11.461 --> 30:13.246
What about all the times
you told me

30:13.289 --> 30:15.074
to just tell Ryan the truth?

30:15.117 --> 30:16.989
I mean, you were
like a broken record.

30:17.032 --> 30:19.252
"Honesty, honesty, honesty."

30:19.295 --> 30:20.862
It got really annoying.

30:20.906 --> 30:23.386
But it worked out,
and now he's moved to Atlanta.

30:23.430 --> 30:25.998
-That's different. That was you.
-Mm.

30:26.041 --> 30:27.695
She's gonna find out eventually,

30:27.738 --> 30:30.263
probably at the
actual charity event.

30:30.306 --> 30:32.918
Unless you are planning
on tending bar

30:32.961 --> 30:34.354
every time you see her.

30:36.965 --> 30:38.575
I'm not ready.

30:38.619 --> 30:40.273
What are you talking about?
The bidding's closing soon.

30:40.316 --> 30:44.364
Yeah, I know that, but I didn't
finish the statement of purpose,

30:44.407 --> 30:46.453
and I never talked
to the appraiser

30:46.496 --> 30:48.368
-about the land's worth.
-Well, why not?

30:48.411 --> 30:51.458
Because I've been busy
with Liam and his friend

30:51.501 --> 30:53.199
and I ran
out of time.

30:53.242 --> 30:54.678
So, you're right.

30:54.722 --> 30:56.680
You know, the work-life balance
is impossible.

30:56.724 --> 30:58.595
Or maybe I'm just, I don't know,
I'm terrible at it.

30:58.639 --> 31:00.771
Hey, no one ever said
it was gonna be easy.

31:00.815 --> 31:02.469
It took me a long time
to figure it out.

31:02.512 --> 31:04.123
Your mother might say
I never did.

31:04.166 --> 31:05.646
I did do
something right.

31:05.689 --> 31:07.909
I raised a very smart daughter.

31:07.953 --> 31:09.563
I know
that you will rise

31:09.606 --> 31:11.347
to the challenge
just like I always managed to.

31:11.391 --> 31:13.480
You're right.

31:13.523 --> 31:15.221
I mean, you do
always rise to the challenge.

31:15.264 --> 31:17.745
You've done thousands
of these deals.

31:17.788 --> 31:19.660
I've seen you walk into meetings
completely unprepared,

31:19.703 --> 31:21.140
and nobody can ever
tell the difference.

31:21.183 --> 31:23.011
All right, I...

31:23.055 --> 31:25.796
am forwarding you these reports
right now.

31:25.840 --> 31:27.320
The bid is now
in your court.

31:27.363 --> 31:28.843
I'm on it.

31:28.887 --> 31:30.279
And we will talk about
your motivational speaking

31:30.323 --> 31:31.280
another time.

31:31.324 --> 31:32.891
I look forward to it.

31:32.934 --> 31:35.719
But right now
I have a toast to make.

31:51.648 --> 31:54.173
Kirby, what are
you doing here?

31:54.216 --> 31:57.176
I live here.
And I want to party.

31:57.219 --> 31:59.091
Step away from the sushi.

31:59.134 --> 32:00.701
It's for guests only.

32:00.744 --> 32:02.529
Did you think that I wouldn't
catch you sneaking in?

32:02.572 --> 32:05.227
Please,
ma'am, can I have some more?

32:05.271 --> 32:06.446
Ugh.

32:06.489 --> 32:07.795
You don't think

32:07.838 --> 32:09.623
I'm good enough for your son,
do you?

32:09.666 --> 32:13.322
You just picking up on that?
Take her upstairs, the back way.

32:13.366 --> 32:16.282
Oh, no. I want to go
to the dance floor.

32:16.325 --> 32:17.674
I want to show Adam

32:17.718 --> 32:19.372
and all those fancy
board members

32:19.415 --> 32:21.722
that I'm a...

32:21.765 --> 32:23.593
class act.

32:23.637 --> 32:26.988
You're drunk. You should...

32:27.032 --> 32:30.426
definitely meet the board.

32:31.775 --> 32:32.951
Hmm.

32:40.741 --> 32:43.004
Mm.

32:43.048 --> 32:45.267
Oh, there's my boyfriend.

32:45.311 --> 32:47.574
He looks so cute,

32:47.617 --> 32:50.490
like a skinny penguin.

32:52.100 --> 32:53.058
Kirby.

32:53.101 --> 32:54.885
Hi, sweetheart.

32:54.929 --> 32:56.104
Sorry I'm late.

32:56.148 --> 32:59.194
Dr. Luperta,
I read your latest book.

32:59.238 --> 33:00.674
Quite the page-turner.

33:00.717 --> 33:03.155
And Mrs. Scarborough?
What an honor. And what a dress.

33:03.198 --> 33:06.941
I'm here to answer any questions
you might have about Adam.

33:06.985 --> 33:08.943
Because we all know the best way
to get to know a man

33:08.987 --> 33:10.858
is through his better half.
And, uh, no,

33:10.901 --> 33:12.381
I'm not talking
about his mother.

33:17.212 --> 33:18.431
Hello, all!

33:18.474 --> 33:20.085
It's Fallon.

33:20.128 --> 33:22.652
In honor of my brother Adam's
birthday, I wanted

33:22.696 --> 33:24.045
to give him a little
something special

33:24.089 --> 33:25.351
-to mark the occasion.
-Liam,

33:25.394 --> 33:26.439
can you give me a hand
with something?

33:26.482 --> 33:28.136
As you all know,

33:28.180 --> 33:30.573
Adam is in charge of
our research program

33:30.617 --> 33:31.835
at the hospital.

33:31.879 --> 33:33.663
He also knows how to read.

33:33.707 --> 33:35.665
So I thought to myself,
"Why not

33:35.709 --> 33:38.929
combine these two interests
for the perfect gift?"

33:38.973 --> 33:41.976
I am commissioning a series
of articles

33:42.020 --> 33:45.588
written by esteemed journalist
Nash Martinez.

33:45.632 --> 33:49.027
Come on up here, Nash.
Don't be shy.

33:49.070 --> 33:50.463
There he is.

33:50.506 --> 33:51.812
Hi, Nash.

33:51.855 --> 33:55.076
This series will delve
into medical mysteries

33:55.120 --> 33:56.556
of the world,

33:56.599 --> 33:58.384
and take Nash to some
of the farthest,

33:58.427 --> 34:00.516
most desolate places
on earth.

34:00.560 --> 34:03.128
So, pack your duffel, Nash.

34:03.171 --> 34:04.607
And don't forget
to send a postcard.

34:04.651 --> 34:06.435
Let's hear it for Nash,
everybody.

34:06.479 --> 34:07.697
Whoo!

34:07.741 --> 34:10.744
Oh, oh, oh, and, uh,
happy reading, Adam.

34:13.138 --> 34:15.140
Worst gift ever.

34:18.882 --> 34:20.536
Suddenly sober, I see.

34:20.580 --> 34:23.626
This little dog and pony show
of yours isn't fooling anyone.

34:23.670 --> 34:26.368
Well, it seems to have convinced
the board. And Adam.

34:26.412 --> 34:28.109
Everyone knows what

34:28.153 --> 34:31.286
a low-class freeloader.
Keep away from my son.

34:31.330 --> 34:33.462
I'm the one who's really
looking out for him.

34:33.506 --> 34:35.203
You don't care if he
gets chief of staff.

34:35.247 --> 34:37.118
You're only using him
to climb back on top

34:37.162 --> 34:38.250
of the Atlanta social scene.

34:38.293 --> 34:40.339
And break us up as a bonus.

34:40.382 --> 34:41.905
Is this true, Mother?

34:41.949 --> 34:44.647
What's true is that I didn't

34:44.691 --> 34:46.649
want her ruining your chances
for chief of staff,

34:46.693 --> 34:49.913
but I would never try
and break you up.

34:49.957 --> 34:51.480
This is where

34:51.524 --> 34:53.439
I feel the need to step in
and call you a liar.

34:53.482 --> 34:54.614
'Cause you're lying.

34:54.657 --> 34:56.311
I should have never
trusted you.

34:56.355 --> 34:57.573
Quite right.

34:57.617 --> 34:59.488
After all, Kirby is my daughter.

34:59.532 --> 35:02.448
My loyalties will always lie
with my girl.

35:07.192 --> 35:08.845
I'm not taking
that assignment.

35:08.889 --> 35:11.152
If you don't do
what we talked about,

35:11.196 --> 35:12.501
I'll be spilling
everything to Liam

35:12.545 --> 35:13.937
about you making me come here.

35:13.981 --> 35:15.852
I will not be blackmailed.

35:15.896 --> 35:16.897
Definitely not by you.

35:16.940 --> 35:18.246
Especially since you
tried to kiss me

35:18.290 --> 35:20.248
the minute Liam's back
was turned.

35:20.292 --> 35:22.990
Please. Like he would
ever believe you.

35:23.033 --> 35:25.166
You're not my type.

35:25.210 --> 35:27.603
No, I think I can
believe it, actually.

35:28.430 --> 35:30.040
You can dress up
all you want, Kirby,

35:30.084 --> 35:33.043
but you will never make
a silk purse from a sow's ear.

35:33.087 --> 35:36.177
I'm sure I'd be insulted
if I knew what that meant.

35:36.221 --> 35:37.744
I can't believe you'd do this.

35:38.788 --> 35:43.184
Hey, did you notice that
the sushi's not quite right?

35:43.228 --> 35:45.621
It would be such a shame if
all your mother's fancy friends

35:45.665 --> 35:47.536
suddenly came down
with food poisoning.

35:47.580 --> 35:49.059

wanted to cowrite with you.

I just didn't want you

36:48.249 --> 36:49.772
to feel neglected.

36:49.816 --> 36:51.774
And I don't want us to end up
like Alexis and Blake.

36:51.818 --> 36:54.124
Fallon. We are nothing
like them.

36:54.168 --> 36:55.343
Well, that's what I said,

36:55.387 --> 36:57.171
but, you know,
sometimes I can be

36:57.215 --> 36:58.433
a chip off the ole Blake,

36:58.477 --> 37:00.218
whether I like it or not.

37:00.261 --> 37:02.481
You're you. And I'm me.

37:02.524 --> 37:04.178
And once I get busy
writing again,

37:04.222 --> 37:06.789
it's inevitable we'll be
spending more time apart.

37:06.833 --> 37:08.791
That's why I was trying
to be around so much now.

37:08.835 --> 37:10.619
Well, why didn't
you say so?

37:10.663 --> 37:13.231
I'm sorry,
that's victim-blaming.

37:13.274 --> 37:14.710
And it's not your fault.

37:14.754 --> 37:17.452
Hey, I promise that I will do

37:17.496 --> 37:18.801
a better job
of balancing it all.

37:18.845 --> 37:20.803
Okay? I'll even
turn off my phone.

37:20.847 --> 37:22.718
Right now, I will.

37:22.762 --> 37:24.546
You know, once I make sure
there's nothing important.

37:24.590 --> 37:27.157
Although nothing
is more important than you.

37:28.681 --> 37:32.815
Not even a... a "911"
text from Blake.

37:33.860 --> 37:34.861
Go.

37:36.079 --> 37:37.690
Just come back soon.

37:41.520 --> 37:44.436
I lost sight of what
is most important.

37:45.785 --> 37:46.786
You.

37:47.787 --> 37:50.268
So you don't think
I'm like a pig's purse

37:50.311 --> 37:51.704
or whatever it is
Alexis called me?

37:51.747 --> 37:53.271
Don't listen to Alexis.

37:53.314 --> 37:54.663
But you listened to her

37:54.707 --> 37:56.752
and then you disinvited
me from the party.

37:56.796 --> 37:58.406
And now I'm worried
you're only ever gonna see me

37:58.450 --> 37:59.842
as the daughter of the help.

37:59.886 --> 38:02.410
Because that's who I am
and always will be.

38:02.454 --> 38:04.064
I'm not a Carrington.

38:04.107 --> 38:06.545
Hey, I wasn't a Carrington
until a few years ago.

38:06.588 --> 38:09.852
So I would never judge you
or look down on you,

38:09.896 --> 38:12.899
because I know what it's like
to be judged.

38:14.030 --> 38:17.295
And once I get this chief of
staff position at the hospital,

38:17.338 --> 38:19.906
I want you there
by my side.

38:21.211 --> 38:22.604
Where you belong.

38:24.084 --> 38:25.825
And once my plan
comes to fruition,

38:25.868 --> 38:28.001
it won't matter at all
who your father is.

38:31.091 --> 38:32.484
Right.

38:38.011 --> 38:40.405
You made the right call,
trusting me tonight.

38:40.448 --> 38:41.710
Is that why you
called me over here?

38:41.754 --> 38:43.625
Because I left
a very cute husband.

38:43.669 --> 38:45.061
The bid was accepted.

38:45.105 --> 38:47.063
The cost analysis paid off,
they loved my passion.

38:47.107 --> 38:49.414
The land now belongs
to Fallon Unlimited.

38:49.457 --> 38:51.198
Well, isn't that good news?

38:51.241 --> 38:54.549
Still not sure why this
deserved a 911 text, but...

38:54.593 --> 38:56.725
Well, there was a bit of a snag.
Apparently,

38:56.769 --> 38:58.901
all of our preliminary building
permits have been denied.

38:58.945 --> 39:01.121
We won't be able to break ground
for the foreseeable future.

39:01.164 --> 39:03.471
What? Well, why didn't
we know about this?

39:03.515 --> 39:05.255
It happened
after the deal closed.

39:05.299 --> 39:06.779
Now, we can try to back out...

39:06.822 --> 39:09.434
No, no. I mean,
then we'd be back to square one

39:09.477 --> 39:10.870
with no place to build.

39:10.913 --> 39:13.046
This was too planned out
to be a coincidence.

39:13.089 --> 39:16.615
Clearly, someone is trying
to keep you from expanding.

39:17.790 --> 39:20.793
The question is... who?

39:25.537 --> 39:28.104
Yeah, I think that's fine.
You're all set up.

39:28.148 --> 39:29.410
Uh, hey, Mia.

39:29.454 --> 39:30.542
Can I talk to you
for a second?

39:30.585 --> 39:33.849
How can I help you,
Mr. Culhane?

39:33.893 --> 39:35.851
I wanted to tell you.

39:35.895 --> 39:37.810
Do you know how embarrassed
I was when I found out

39:37.853 --> 39:39.420
you're actually one
of our underwriters

39:39.464 --> 39:41.857
for the event next week?

39:41.901 --> 39:44.556
I was ordering you around,
giving you chores.

39:44.599 --> 39:47.080
I didn't mean to mislead you.

39:47.123 --> 39:48.603
It just sort of happened,

39:48.647 --> 39:49.909
and truthfully

39:49.952 --> 39:51.345
it was kind of nice

39:51.389 --> 39:53.042
being treated like a regular guy
for a change.

39:53.086 --> 39:57.307
Plus... I didn't want to ruin
the thing we had going.

39:57.351 --> 40:00.223
We didn't have a "thing" going.

40:00.267 --> 40:02.051
We were just getting along.

40:02.095 --> 40:04.576
Under false pretenses.

40:04.619 --> 40:08.797
Look, I've had some personal
issues with rich men lately,

40:08.841 --> 40:12.192
so maybe it's best if we
keep it strictly professional

40:12.235 --> 40:14.107
from now on.

40:23.943 --> 40:27.425
Not a true Carrington? Harsh.

40:29.165 --> 40:30.950
Well, I had to sell it.

40:30.993 --> 40:32.168
And she bought it,

40:32.212 --> 40:33.431
hook, line and sinker.

40:33.474 --> 40:34.867
Just like you predicted.

40:34.910 --> 40:36.999
The fake seismic reports

40:37.043 --> 40:39.915
and your raw diamonds
really helped convince her.

40:39.959 --> 40:42.178
Well, I've known Alexis
for over 30 years--

40:42.222 --> 40:45.138
her pride and her greed have
always clouded her judgment.

40:45.181 --> 40:46.356
I'll take those back now.

40:46.400 --> 40:48.010
No, no, no. Not so fast.

40:48.054 --> 40:51.449
I had to give Alexis a few of
these to maintain the ruse.

40:51.492 --> 40:53.233
I think I deserve the rest,

40:53.276 --> 40:55.278
don't you? Consider
it a down payment

40:55.322 --> 40:56.584
for my help.

40:56.628 --> 40:57.890
Without me,

40:57.933 --> 41:00.762
your plan to steal
the manor back won't work.

41:00.806 --> 41:02.721
Hmm. Extortion.

41:02.764 --> 41:04.505
Well, spoken
like a true Carrington.

41:04.549 --> 41:06.725
And a true Deveraux.

41:09.641 --> 41:12.557
Hello, is this Oliver Knoble?

41:12.600 --> 41:16.256
You don't know me, but I'm
a friend of your ex-girlfriend.

41:16.299 --> 41:17.605
Kirby?

41:17.649 --> 41:19.085
Oh, she's fine.

41:19.128 --> 41:21.566
A little lonely but fine.

41:21.609 --> 41:26.092
Tell me, do you have any
interest in visiting Atlanta?

41:27.485 --> 41:29.095
As soon as possible.

41:29.138 --> 41:33.099
And don't worry about the cost.
That won't be a problem.

41:33.142 --> 41:35.971
You being here is
what's important.

41:43.892 --> 41:45.894
