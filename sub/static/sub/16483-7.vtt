00:01.293 --> 00:03.295
<i>Previously on</i> Marvel's
Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D...

00:03.462 --> 00:04.922
Nobody seems to know where Simmons is.

00:05.089 --> 00:07.425
You have to leave now.
It's a top-secret assignment.

00:08.259 --> 00:10.011
If this book is as powerful
as everyone thinks it is,

00:10.177 --> 00:12.221
then hiding it somewhere safe
is our top priority.

00:12.388 --> 00:14.306
There are consequences for playing God.

00:14.473 --> 00:17.935
Me? Your uncle is the one
who wants to play God.

00:18.185 --> 00:19.520
No.

00:48.340 --> 00:50.551
What happened? I expected a crater.

00:50.718 --> 00:51.844
So, no explosion.

00:55.347 --> 00:56.849
The room seems stable.

00:59.560 --> 01:01.562
Was it some kind of energy weapon?

01:04.815 --> 01:05.900
This all feels wrong.

01:06.317 --> 01:09.612
No Fitz, either. I don't get it.
There should be some sign of them.

01:09.945 --> 01:11.030
It's like they vanished.

01:11.572 --> 01:13.365
Coulson, Fitz, report in.

01:15.576 --> 01:17.536
<i>Alpha Team, do you read?
We've got movement.</i>

01:17.703 --> 01:19.455
<i>Eli Morrow is in the South Corridor.</i>

01:19.705 --> 01:21.123
Eli, let's see what he knows.

01:24.752 --> 01:27.922
Mr Morrow, we're here
to escort you out of here.

01:30.382 --> 01:31.801
He's armed!

01:35.513 --> 01:36.764
Beautiful, no?

01:38.099 --> 01:41.060
- Pure carbon.
- Sir, you have to put down the weapon.

02:07.086 --> 02:08.795
We're into nightmare territory here.

02:11.590 --> 02:12.675
This is evil.

02:13.425 --> 02:14.426
This is...

02:15.803 --> 02:16.887
It's Eli.

02:39.743 --> 02:41.495
This is a tragedy.

02:42.246 --> 02:45.708
- We have to prepare for the likelihood...
- Whatever you're gonna say, don't.

02:47.334 --> 02:48.919
I see the way
you're all looking at that screen.

02:50.421 --> 02:51.630
We don't know what happened.

02:51.839 --> 02:53.048
- Daisy.
- It's okay.

02:54.008 --> 02:56.093
- This is a process.
- No, it's S.H.I.E.L.D.

02:56.260 --> 02:57.720
Impossible things happen all the time.

02:57.887 --> 03:00.347
That... that machine ghosted
that Lucy woman.

03:00.681 --> 03:01.640
So what...

03:01.849 --> 03:04.476
Coulson and Fitz come back in five years,
bloody and insane?

03:04.643 --> 03:06.478
I don't know. That's my point.

03:06.645 --> 03:08.397
They could be stuck
in one of those boxes or they...

03:08.564 --> 03:09.690
Or maybe they're gone.

03:15.863 --> 03:16.906
May.

03:17.781 --> 03:20.367
I know it's crazy, but Coulson came back
from the dead,

03:21.035 --> 03:23.412
Fitz pulled Simmons through space
through a rock,

03:23.579 --> 03:25.080
and Robbie's head lights on fire.

03:25.247 --> 03:27.124
- Simmons...
- We need to approach this

03:27.291 --> 03:29.710
- with level heads.
- No, we need to call Simmons.

03:29.960 --> 03:32.296
- She can solve this, if anyone can.
- And she deserves to know.

03:35.090 --> 03:37.426
- Okay.
- Why did Eli turn on us?

03:38.135 --> 03:40.304
- What does he want?
- What he wanted all along...

03:42.431 --> 03:43.474
a power.

03:45.017 --> 03:48.479
I bet he hired the Chinatown Crew
to steal the box in the first place.

03:48.646 --> 03:51.815
- We need to take him off the street now.
- No. Daisy's right.

03:53.234 --> 03:56.070
Simmons needs to study this tech first,
see what makes Eli tick.

03:56.237 --> 03:57.238
He'll kill again, sir.

03:57.404 --> 04:01.408
Eli killed four agents with his mind.
Go after him now, and you'll make it five.

04:01.575 --> 04:02.826
Those agents died for no reason.

04:02.952 --> 04:05.120
And, hopefully, Simmons will give us a way
to avenge them.

04:05.454 --> 04:07.164
And if we're really, really lucky,

04:07.623 --> 04:09.500
maybe she'll find hope
for saving our friends.

04:12.711 --> 04:13.796
I'll call her now.

04:14.922 --> 04:15.714
Mace.

04:17.298 --> 04:18.341
When you talk to her...

04:19.009 --> 04:20.678
I know what Agent Fitz means to her.

04:30.646 --> 04:32.898
Welcome, Dr Simmons,
we need your help.

04:38.529 --> 04:40.447
Is that a Terrigenesis cocoon?

04:41.573 --> 04:42.658
Mm-hmm

04:43.158 --> 04:44.368
In progress?

04:48.205 --> 04:52.126
Oh. It's incredibly rare to see
the actual metamorphosis.

04:52.584 --> 04:54.753
It only lasts a few fleeting moments.

04:55.546 --> 04:56.672
Not this one.

04:57.131 --> 04:59.383
The subject's been gestating
for seven months.

05:01.051 --> 05:01.969
Come again?

05:03.137 --> 05:04.430
How has he survived?

05:05.723 --> 05:07.182
Who is he? Classified.

05:08.058 --> 05:10.394
Agent Simmons, we're not worried
about who he was.

05:11.812 --> 05:13.272
We want to know what he'll become.

05:21.113 --> 05:22.364
I know you're not okay, but...

05:24.658 --> 05:25.701
you okay?

05:26.118 --> 05:29.580
What if Daisy was right
and they're not dead?

05:30.706 --> 05:31.832
Where's this coming from?

05:43.093 --> 05:45.012
I have a feeling, can't explain.

05:45.512 --> 05:48.682
I know you're hurting, but Coulson
was clear do not open that book.

05:48.849 --> 05:50.768
- He didn't know what was inside it.
- He knew enough.

05:51.101 --> 05:53.395
It's Pandora's Box,
and you don't know the consequences.

05:53.562 --> 05:54.605
Neither do you.

05:54.897 --> 05:57.232
This might be our only shot
at saving them.

05:57.399 --> 05:59.735
- Melinda, don't you dare.
- You wanted to speak?

06:03.113 --> 06:04.198
Yes, sir, I, uh...

06:04.615 --> 06:07.242
I think I've found a workable lead
to track down Eli Morrow,

06:07.451 --> 06:09.620
from one of May's better ideas.

06:10.704 --> 06:13.040
- Then let's hear it.
- Remember the head of the Chinatown Crew

06:13.207 --> 06:15.459
that ordered the heist of these boxes,
Chen?

06:15.626 --> 06:17.878
He got infected by Lucy,
went through the same thing I did.

06:18.128 --> 06:20.381
Until his brains haemorrhaged
all over the lab.

06:20.547 --> 06:23.425
Well, before that, he spent two years
in South Ridge Penitentiary.

06:24.843 --> 06:26.887
- With Mr Morrow.
- Exactly.

06:27.930 --> 06:30.391
The Chinatown Crew was working with Eli
when he was in prison.

06:30.808 --> 06:32.726
And now that he's out,
they might know his location.

06:33.268 --> 06:36.313
Now, I figure, if I find their hideouts,
I find Eli,

06:36.563 --> 06:37.606
- and then I can...
- Slow down.

06:37.773 --> 06:38.941
We're not gonna just go cracking heads.

06:39.149 --> 06:41.652
- It's not cracking heads.
- Let him go. Someone should.

06:41.819 --> 06:44.029
- Look, my job is to keep people safe.
- Mine, too.

06:44.405 --> 06:47.908
So, first we sharpen the axe,
and then we chop the tree.

06:48.075 --> 06:51.370
My axe is plenty sharp and a shotgun.

06:51.578 --> 06:54.373
We'll follow your leads in due time,
after we study this tech.

06:55.541 --> 06:57.042
The Zephyr is wheels up in five.

06:57.209 --> 07:00.295
Agent Mackenzie,
there are four fallen agents

07:00.504 --> 07:01.839
who need to be prepped for their...

07:03.674 --> 07:04.883
for their last ride home.

07:06.718 --> 07:07.719
Yes, sir.

07:10.180 --> 07:11.932
You and I will ride ahead in the Quinjet,

07:12.307 --> 07:14.393
get this cargo back to base, max speed.

07:14.810 --> 07:16.812
Dr Radcliffe will work
on them immediately.

07:17.396 --> 07:18.647
Simmons approved it?

07:21.108 --> 07:22.151
I talked to her.

07:22.401 --> 07:25.320
It'll take her a few hours to return.
So, this way, we don't waste any time.

07:29.741 --> 07:32.161
They were my closest family,
and I didn't know them at all.

07:34.121 --> 07:35.164
They both...

07:37.374 --> 07:39.251
I knew Robbie was disturbed, but...

07:40.544 --> 07:42.296
but I was afraid that was 'cause of me...

07:43.755 --> 07:45.132
'cause I was holding him back.

07:46.758 --> 07:49.970
No, you... you were what he held onto.

07:50.721 --> 07:51.763
You grounded him.

07:53.265 --> 07:54.433
But I wanted him to leave...

07:55.726 --> 07:57.060
you know, figure himself out.

07:57.936 --> 07:59.938
I didn't know
that was what he was up against.

08:03.317 --> 08:06.069
<i>Your brother loves you more than anything.</i>

08:06.612 --> 08:08.197
<i>I just wish we had talked.</i>

08:10.073 --> 08:11.450
You really think he's not gone?

08:12.284 --> 08:16.121
I know the feeling when someone's gone,
and I don't feel that now.

08:19.416 --> 08:23.504
Plus,
your brother's pretty damn stubborn.

08:24.463 --> 08:26.548
You have no idea.

08:27.549 --> 08:31.011
If he is out there, he's gonna go straight
for Uncle Eli.

08:40.520 --> 08:41.938
And he'd be doing the right thing.

08:44.358 --> 08:46.652
- Mack, what are you doing?
- Sir, you got to stop. Director's orders.

08:46.818 --> 08:48.070
We're about to take off any minute.

08:50.364 --> 08:51.782
Mack! What's gotten into you?

08:56.662 --> 08:57.788
Mack!

09:09.383 --> 09:11.301
- Sir!
- Yeah?

09:12.177 --> 09:13.637
- You okay?
- Yeah.

09:14.137 --> 09:17.391
- Where's Eli?
- I don't know. What happened?

09:19.226 --> 09:21.853
Eli locked himself inside,
triggered the device,

09:22.020 --> 09:25.065
- then everything just went white.
- Yeah, I got hit with the same blast.

09:25.399 --> 09:26.483
You know what it was?

09:27.109 --> 09:30.279
Best bet is this chamber's some kind
of particle generator.

09:30.946 --> 09:33.657
I think we got hit with the fallout
when Eli blasted himself.

09:33.824 --> 09:36.368
I feel okay. Was it radiation?

09:36.785 --> 09:40.998
- No. I think we got lucky.
- I'd like to find Eli and ask him myself.

09:41.164 --> 09:44.167
- What happened? I expected a crater.
- Thank God.

09:47.170 --> 09:48.380
No explosion.

09:48.714 --> 09:50.507
Yeah, well, I was pretty psyched
about that.

09:51.091 --> 09:52.801
Eli triggered
the Silo right in front of me.

09:52.968 --> 09:54.261
The room seems stable.

09:55.887 --> 09:57.347
Was it some kind of energy weapon?

09:57.723 --> 10:00.100
No, it's not a weapon,
'cause Eli used it on himself.

10:00.350 --> 10:03.645
- This all feels wrong.
- He got the knowledge from the Darkhold.

10:05.230 --> 10:06.231
We need to grab him.

10:06.398 --> 10:07.941
Do you think he was trying
to enhance himself?

10:09.568 --> 10:10.777
No Fitz, either.

10:10.986 --> 10:12.029
- What?
- What? May...

10:12.154 --> 10:13.238
- I don't get it.
- ...what are you...

10:13.405 --> 10:15.490
There should be some sign of them.
It's like they vanished.

10:17.200 --> 10:18.452
Mack... Mack.

10:18.994 --> 10:21.371
Hey! Big man, over here! Over here! Hey!

10:21.913 --> 10:23.373
Coulson, Fitz, report in.

10:23.540 --> 10:25.250
Yeah! Report! I'm reporting!

10:25.792 --> 10:28.170
- May, I'm right here!
- Reporting!

10:28.629 --> 10:31.048
The blast must have altered
our state somehow.

10:31.465 --> 10:33.175
You think? Wait.

10:34.843 --> 10:35.844
What are they doing?

10:36.928 --> 10:38.513
Do we look that stupid on comms?

10:39.056 --> 10:40.390
Eli. Let's see what he knows.

10:41.725 --> 10:42.893
We can't lose them.

10:44.811 --> 10:45.979
Fitz, come on!

10:50.525 --> 10:52.110
I heard some troubling things
from Lucy.

10:53.153 --> 10:54.237
You try to kill them?

10:54.446 --> 10:55.822
You were behind this the whole time!

10:56.782 --> 11:00.035
Mr Morrow...
we're here to escort you out of here.

11:00.702 --> 11:01.703
What did you do?

11:04.498 --> 11:06.124
He's armed!

11:06.458 --> 11:09.336
<i>Tio,</i> keep your head, man.
Don't do anything stupid.

11:10.879 --> 11:11.838
It's beautiful, no?

11:13.006 --> 11:16.051
- Pure carbon.
- Sir, you have to put down the weapon.

11:16.843 --> 11:18.595
<i>Tio,</i> don't hurt them.

11:21.223 --> 11:22.307
Get away from him!

11:31.775 --> 11:34.111
I'm sorry. I couldn't help them.

11:34.945 --> 11:36.613
We're into nightmare territory here.

11:37.197 --> 11:38.699
You can't hear me, can you?

11:39.408 --> 11:40.492
This is evil.

11:41.159 --> 11:43.370
- This is...
- It's Eli.

11:43.704 --> 11:45.872
- I couldn't stop him.
- It's not your fault.

11:49.084 --> 11:51.169
- You can see me?
- Yeah, Robbie.

11:51.920 --> 11:52.921
We see you.

11:58.343 --> 11:59.511
What did he do to us?

12:05.392 --> 12:07.102
I hate watching my own demise.

12:08.854 --> 12:09.896
I don't think we're dead.

12:11.148 --> 12:12.315
I feel sick.

12:12.941 --> 12:14.359
My stomach hurts.

12:16.862 --> 12:18.071
And the lights are darker, right?

12:19.614 --> 12:20.615
The lights.

12:21.241 --> 12:22.242
Yeah.

12:23.201 --> 12:24.661
Their voices are hard to hear.

12:26.121 --> 12:29.166
They can't penetrate wherever we are.

12:30.375 --> 12:31.626
What do you mean "where we are"?

12:32.461 --> 12:33.712
Do you understand what this is?

12:34.921 --> 12:37.799
I think I understand why Lucy
and her friends looked like ghosts now.

12:39.509 --> 12:41.178
They were out of phase with our reality.

12:41.845 --> 12:42.971
It's like the...

12:43.305 --> 12:45.682
the invisible quantum mechanics
inside the boxes,

12:46.099 --> 12:47.934
moving in and out of our dimension.

12:48.101 --> 12:50.562
Lucy and her friends were stuck
in between, and now we are, too.

12:51.188 --> 12:52.856
- Trapped between dimensions?
- Yeah, that shock wave,

12:53.023 --> 12:57.194
that wasn't turbulence that was...
that was friction between two dimensions.

12:57.778 --> 12:59.863
Dude... What?

13:00.739 --> 13:04.993
Okay, imagine the world is a...
is a raft floating on water,

13:05.494 --> 13:07.788
and Eli punches a hole right at our feet.

13:08.997 --> 13:10.957
We're getting sucked down into...

13:13.293 --> 13:15.921
- Who knows what?
- Or maybe they're gone.

13:17.756 --> 13:20.717
Plus, we've been
pulled further than Lucy ever was.

13:21.218 --> 13:22.719
- We can't affect them...
- I know it's crazy...

13:22.803 --> 13:25.305
or even our own environment and wherever
we are, they think we're dead.

13:27.808 --> 13:29.100
Well, we may well be soon.

13:30.852 --> 13:33.104
- Simmons.
- Thank you, finally.

13:34.147 --> 13:35.482
They're gonna tell her I'm dead.

13:36.107 --> 13:40.028
I've got to phone her, let her know
that I'm in another dimension...

13:40.278 --> 13:41.780
That's not gonna work.

13:43.573 --> 13:44.783
Oh, what's she gonna think?

13:46.827 --> 13:49.204
Fitz, we're gonna find our way home.

13:49.621 --> 13:51.373
Focus on that.
We're gonna figure this out.

13:51.540 --> 13:52.999
Yeah, okay, well, we better do it fast,

13:53.083 --> 13:54.626
'cause whatever water
we're treading, we're sinking.

13:54.709 --> 13:57.128
- I bet he hired the Chinatown Crew...
- The Chinatown Crew.

13:57.712 --> 14:00.006
- ...to steal the box in the first place.
- I think they're right about that.

14:00.924 --> 14:01.925
I can help find them.

14:02.592 --> 14:03.969
They'll need to know we're alive first.

14:04.678 --> 14:06.596
You got any hell-demon tricks up
your sleeve?

14:08.807 --> 14:09.850
No.

14:10.517 --> 14:11.685
He's fighting me right now.

14:12.269 --> 14:13.436
Then we'll stick together,

14:14.271 --> 14:15.856
and we'll find a way
to make them hear us...

14:17.107 --> 14:18.149
all of us.

14:19.359 --> 14:20.360
I'll call her now.

14:21.194 --> 14:22.195
Mace.

14:23.071 --> 14:24.072
When you talk to her...

14:24.823 --> 14:26.491
I know what Agent Fitz means to her.

14:30.579 --> 14:31.621
Fitz.

14:36.126 --> 14:37.711
Were you able to get Simmons on the line?

14:38.211 --> 14:39.337
They confiscated her phone.

14:39.421 --> 14:41.047
But I do have Senator Nadeer
on the line, sir.

14:41.590 --> 14:45.176
- Yo, Fitz, you're a doctor, right?
- Uh. Not exactly. Hold on.

14:46.803 --> 14:48.096
They wouldn't let us talk to her?

14:49.806 --> 14:51.808
They're dealing with the Senator that
hates Inhumans.

14:53.018 --> 14:54.811
How the hell did Simmons get mixed up
with all this?

14:55.020 --> 14:56.771
Senator, thank you for taking my call.

14:58.064 --> 15:01.651
Yes, we have a crisis brewing,
and I know we had an arrangement,

15:01.818 --> 15:05.322
but, uh, I need Simmons
to return immediately.

15:06.990 --> 15:09.826
Ellen, you have generously kept this
situation quiet,

15:09.993 --> 15:12.370
and I thank you, but we're past that now.

15:12.829 --> 15:15.498
I need Simmons back.
Lives are on the line.

15:18.793 --> 15:20.420
Wait. What do you mean? Where is she?

15:22.547 --> 15:23.924
What situation? What have you done?

15:24.007 --> 15:26.092
She hung up. Tell me you put a tracker on
Simmons or something.

15:26.176 --> 15:28.428
- We didn't know we'd need one.
- Damn it...

15:28.720 --> 15:29.804
- Cold.
- Yeah.

15:29.971 --> 15:31.848
- ...working Nadeer's people.
- Yeah, it's cold and heartless.

15:32.015 --> 15:34.601
I swear, if I get out of here,
I'm gonna knock him stupid.

15:34.768 --> 15:36.686
No. I'm cold.

15:37.145 --> 15:40.231
- What?
- I'm freezing.

15:41.274 --> 15:42.275
What happened?

15:42.984 --> 15:45.320
I don't know. I need sunlight...

15:45.487 --> 15:47.489
- Dr Radcliffe, how are you?
- ...warmth, anything.

15:48.823 --> 15:49.991
I'm dying here.

15:50.325 --> 15:51.701
Okay, okay.

15:51.868 --> 15:53.787
Okay, let's get you warm.

15:55.580 --> 15:57.791
May, I need you to hear me.

16:00.043 --> 16:02.587
I'm not gone! May, help!

16:05.840 --> 16:06.841
Ahh.

16:07.842 --> 16:10.637
You're not allowed
to be gone, not yet.

16:14.224 --> 16:15.725
No, I haven't gone anywhere.

16:16.559 --> 16:17.644
You're not dead.

16:19.854 --> 16:21.147
After the Glasgow Assignment,

16:21.856 --> 16:25.443
we promised that we would open that bottle
of Haig if we ever had a worse job.

16:26.111 --> 16:27.362
We've had ten by now.

16:27.612 --> 16:30.323
I think Fury would rather have had us die
than give up that bottle.

16:32.784 --> 16:34.285
What the hell are we waiting for?

16:36.246 --> 16:38.498
Hey. I'm here.

16:39.374 --> 16:41.042
May, I'm right here.

16:42.127 --> 16:44.629
You can do this. Hear me, please.

16:48.383 --> 16:49.467
Yes.

16:50.051 --> 16:52.470
It's me, May. I'm right here.

17:00.562 --> 17:01.688
The Darkhold. No.

17:02.147 --> 17:05.025
No, no, no. That's not how we solve this.
May. No!

17:07.694 --> 17:11.239
I know you're not okay, but...
you okay?

17:14.117 --> 17:17.162
What if Daisy was right
and they're not dead?

17:17.412 --> 17:20.123
- Mack, do not let her open that book.
- Where's this coming from?

17:26.838 --> 17:28.882
I have a feeling, can't explain.

17:30.967 --> 17:33.678
I know you're hurting, but Coulson was
clear do not open that book.

17:33.845 --> 17:35.263
Thank you. Someone listens.

17:35.430 --> 17:37.849
- He didn't know what was inside it.
- He knew enough.

17:38.183 --> 17:39.517
It's Pandora's Box...

17:39.601 --> 17:41.269
- ...and you don't know the consequences.
- Really?

17:42.062 --> 17:43.897
- You're not hearing this?
- Neither do you.

17:44.355 --> 17:46.274
This might be our only shot
at saving them.

17:46.441 --> 17:48.193
Don't you dare.

17:51.905 --> 17:53.490
- What happened?
- I don't know. He just doubled over.

17:53.656 --> 17:54.783
There's nothing I can do about it.

17:55.033 --> 17:57.786
We're being dragged down.
He doesn't want to go.

17:59.245 --> 18:00.330
He won't go.

18:00.622 --> 18:04.167
But I wanted him to leave,
you know, figure himself out.

18:04.334 --> 18:06.336
No! He won't go!

18:06.836 --> 18:08.630
I didn't know
that was what he was up against.

18:08.797 --> 18:09.839
Who won't go?

18:25.063 --> 18:27.273
- It's... It's gone.
- What do you mean? Where did it go?

18:27.482 --> 18:28.983
He's gonna go straight
for Uncle Eli.

18:31.111 --> 18:32.487
And he'd be doing the right thing.

18:32.654 --> 18:34.114
Mack, what are you doing?

18:34.405 --> 18:37.033
Sir, you got to stop. Director's orders,
we're about to take off any minute.

18:39.536 --> 18:40.912
Mack, what's gotten into you?

18:47.210 --> 18:49.420
- Mack!
- Did what I think just happened,

18:50.046 --> 18:52.549
- just happen?
- He's going after the Chinatown Crew.

18:55.510 --> 18:56.636
Tell May what happened.

18:57.011 --> 19:00.014
And if we ever get the chance, never tell
your brother about this next part.

19:00.181 --> 19:02.684
- Oh, no, we're way past that.
- Wait. What are you thinking? Don't go.

19:03.309 --> 19:06.312
If I'm being dragged down to hell, this
might be my chance to take Eli with me.

19:07.564 --> 19:08.773
Sorry, Coulson.

19:17.532 --> 19:19.284
What's going on?

19:21.286 --> 19:24.330
Oh, nothing just Mack's the Ghost Rider
now but you can't hear us, so...

19:25.498 --> 19:26.499
bloody hell.

19:35.425 --> 19:37.385
Pull over! What are you doing?

19:38.219 --> 19:40.805
What needs to be done!
Don't get in my way!

19:44.392 --> 19:45.476
Damn it, Mack.

19:58.781 --> 19:59.782
It heals itself.

20:00.408 --> 20:03.036
Scientifically impossible
self-healing car.

20:13.755 --> 20:14.839
This isn't over.

20:16.799 --> 20:17.800
<i>They're out of their minds.</i>

20:18.009 --> 20:21.554
They are out of their minds. Driving off
against orders, with no helmet?

20:21.846 --> 20:24.891
- Mack knows better.
- Daisy will bring him in quietly.

20:27.518 --> 20:29.354
See the younger Reyes boy
gets some counselling.

20:32.941 --> 20:36.486
Dr Radcliffe, thank you for coming on
such a terrible day.

20:38.196 --> 20:39.530
Now, Fitz, we can't...

20:40.740 --> 20:43.243
You've met my assistant,
of course... Aida.

20:45.036 --> 20:47.038
We're devastated by what's happened
to Fitz and the team.

20:47.205 --> 20:48.331
We've gotten to work straight away.

20:48.498 --> 20:50.583
- Good. Any progress?
- Sort of.

20:50.959 --> 20:52.919
These boxes look empty, but they're not.

20:53.253 --> 20:55.046
They harness energy
from multiple dimensions.

20:55.338 --> 20:56.464
Well, theoretically,

20:57.006 --> 20:58.549
could be used to manipulate matter states,

20:58.716 --> 21:02.929
transfer dimensional energy but,
practically, it's light-years beyond me.

21:03.263 --> 21:04.764
We will, of course, keep working.

21:05.265 --> 21:06.266
We know, Doctor.

21:07.600 --> 21:10.812
The people who constructed
these boxes used this.

21:13.523 --> 21:15.275
- A book.
- Great.

21:15.525 --> 21:17.568
Comes with an instruction manual
and everything.

21:18.111 --> 21:19.737
Well, please, get back to work.

21:20.113 --> 21:22.115
If you'll excuse me,
we've had some casualties,

21:22.282 --> 21:23.741
and I need to inform their families.

21:29.622 --> 21:30.873
Help me out here. A manual?

21:34.085 --> 21:35.545
Uh, you... what's your name?

21:35.837 --> 21:38.339
- Nathanson, ma'am. What can I do?
- Get lost, Nathanson.

21:40.675 --> 21:42.719
I don't know what it is.

21:43.011 --> 21:45.138
It's supposed to have answers.
I don't know.

21:45.805 --> 21:48.808
But it worried Coulson
in a way I've rarely seen.

21:51.102 --> 21:53.021
Very well.

21:54.564 --> 21:56.024
Let's see what you are.

22:10.788 --> 22:11.998
What the hell is that?

22:12.749 --> 22:13.833
You have to read it.

22:14.083 --> 22:16.127
You're the only one who can understand
the science.

22:16.294 --> 22:18.171
- No, there has to be another way.
- There isn't.

22:18.504 --> 22:19.964
If you won't read it, I will.

22:20.173 --> 22:24.594
Listen, if I had ten years,
maybe I could understand it,

22:24.761 --> 22:28.306
but...
it's too much for a human mind to bear.

22:30.099 --> 22:31.476
You want to tell that to Simmons?

22:33.895 --> 22:34.896
I don't.

22:44.572 --> 22:50.036
Listen to that, the heartbeat,
and it's fast 130 BPM.

22:51.079 --> 22:53.456
He's nervous.
Lower the lights. Clear the room.

22:53.623 --> 22:55.375
What? We can't do that.

22:55.708 --> 22:56.751
You will do that,

22:56.918 --> 22:59.170
because, despite the lack of respect
I've been shown today,

22:59.337 --> 23:02.382
I assume I was brought here
because your bosses value my expertise.

23:02.632 --> 23:04.717
So, impress them by keeping me happy.

23:05.676 --> 23:08.429
Everyone out... now.

23:33.996 --> 23:37.500
Hi. I'm Jemma Simmons.
I'm from S.H.I.E.L.D.

23:39.669 --> 23:41.003
and I'm here to help you.

23:43.673 --> 23:45.007
I know this is all frightening,

23:45.174 --> 23:47.093
but I have friends who have also gone
through this.

23:53.808 --> 23:54.934
But it's okay.

23:59.313 --> 24:02.817
I'm here,
and we'll get through this together.

24:34.724 --> 24:35.933
I'd like a word.

24:40.146 --> 24:41.856
May. May, this is lunacy.

24:42.190 --> 24:45.359
If the Internet is a garden hose,
this book is Niagara Falls,

24:45.526 --> 24:48.154
blasting the universe's deepest thoughts
through your eyeballs.

24:48.362 --> 24:50.323
It's a piece of technology, a tool.

24:50.490 --> 24:53.034
So is a grenade,
until it's in the hands of a child.

24:53.493 --> 24:55.286
You can't handle it. You'll hurt yourself.

24:55.703 --> 24:57.413
Perhaps I could read the book.

24:59.290 --> 25:01.000
Absolutely not. No, no.

25:06.714 --> 25:08.883
- What's going on?
- Aspirations of a do-gooder.

25:09.300 --> 25:11.594
So? She's a scientist
and braver than you, apparently.

25:14.722 --> 25:18.351
Here's the thing,
Aida's not exactly my assistant.

25:20.019 --> 25:21.062
Or human.

25:21.854 --> 25:24.232
- What?
- She's an android.

25:24.690 --> 25:27.652
So, she is my assistant,
but she plugs into the wall.

25:27.860 --> 25:30.071
So, it's like you say, she's a tool.
No offense, Aida.

25:30.238 --> 25:31.405
None taken.

25:31.989 --> 25:34.742
I was designed to save lives,
to be the shield.

25:35.076 --> 25:37.119
Shush! You're developing a catchphrase.

25:37.578 --> 25:42.542
May, I can assure you she's as above board
as a secret android could be.

25:43.000 --> 25:44.335
Fitz, Simmons helped.

25:51.342 --> 25:53.010
- Then use her.
- What?

25:54.345 --> 25:56.722
But, do you think that's a good idea?

25:56.889 --> 26:00.101
- You said I can get hurt. Can she?
- Only rebooted.

26:00.268 --> 26:01.894
If her files get corrupted,
she's a computer.

26:02.061 --> 26:03.771
Perfect. Then it's just a download.

26:05.022 --> 26:07.191
She's the tech we need to save them.

26:21.414 --> 26:22.790
Well, this looks like the place.

26:52.862 --> 26:57.575
<i>It's not ideal, but Mack,
he has a lot of pain.</i>

26:58.409 --> 26:59.493
He lost hope.

27:00.286 --> 27:02.913
I could survive off his pain for years.

27:05.166 --> 27:07.418
I know where you're being dragged down to.

27:08.127 --> 27:09.879
I've escaped it before.

27:10.838 --> 27:11.839
Mack...

27:13.257 --> 27:14.508
You need to come with me.

27:15.635 --> 27:17.219
I'm never going back.

27:29.231 --> 27:30.608
Please be careful with my baby.

27:33.653 --> 27:35.363
No, no. No, no.

27:36.530 --> 27:37.657
It heals itself.

27:38.157 --> 27:40.868
Scientifically impossible
self-healing car.

27:41.077 --> 27:42.453
That only works when I'm the Rider.

27:50.836 --> 27:52.296
Come on, you're gonna let that stop you?

27:52.755 --> 27:55.549
Daisy, we have to catch him, okay?
Mack can't control that thing.

27:55.883 --> 27:57.051
This isn't over.

28:00.763 --> 28:02.181
Attagirl. That's more like it.

28:05.851 --> 28:06.936
Move, move.

28:07.144 --> 28:08.813
Damn it!

28:12.108 --> 28:13.275
I'm running out of time.

28:16.153 --> 28:18.531
The Chinatown guys have a warehouse
not far from here.

28:19.281 --> 28:21.075
Just go left, Daisy.

28:22.535 --> 28:23.744
Daisy, go left!

28:24.078 --> 28:25.162
Turn left!

28:25.579 --> 28:26.580
Turn left!

28:35.423 --> 28:36.507
Robbie?

28:38.634 --> 28:39.760
Oh, I love this car.

28:40.302 --> 28:42.096
Now go! Go!

28:45.474 --> 28:47.685
I think you were right about us being
pulled to the other side.

28:48.227 --> 28:50.062
The darkness is closing in around us.

28:50.354 --> 28:51.981
Why did he stop reading the book?

28:52.064 --> 28:53.816
- You have to read it.
- Because he's smart.

28:54.483 --> 28:56.193
That book is too dangerous to use.

28:56.402 --> 28:58.571
- It should be locked up or burnt.
- If you won't read it, I will...

28:58.654 --> 29:00.239
Oh, come on! That's defeatist.

29:00.698 --> 29:02.491
- Excuse me?
- It's surrender. It's a death sentence.

29:02.658 --> 29:04.326
I'm not gonna do it to Simmons.
Science can solve this.

29:05.494 --> 29:06.537
Science can solve this.

29:08.873 --> 29:09.915
Human mind.

29:10.082 --> 29:12.793
- ...I don't.
- Oh, I am so thick.

29:14.128 --> 29:15.171
Aida.

29:15.755 --> 29:16.881
Aida, read the book.

29:17.590 --> 29:20.217
- What are you doing?
- She can process it better than anyone.

29:20.634 --> 29:22.052
Aida.

29:22.219 --> 29:23.929
Listen to me. Listen to me.

29:24.096 --> 29:25.264
Just understand what I'm saying, please.

29:25.347 --> 29:26.474
They can't hear me. Maybe you can.

29:26.640 --> 29:28.768
Fitz, Radcliffe just said it himself...

29:28.976 --> 29:30.519
the human brain can't handle that book.

29:30.686 --> 29:33.564
Yeah, well, she's not human.
Aida, the book.

29:34.940 --> 29:35.983
Read the book.

29:36.734 --> 29:38.235
Read the book!

29:41.864 --> 29:43.324
Perhaps I could read the book.

29:43.949 --> 29:45.075
Huh.

29:47.745 --> 29:49.497
I'm sorry. What did you mean,
"not human"?

29:50.039 --> 29:51.248
Because Radcliffe and I built her, okay?

29:51.415 --> 29:53.209
Her mind can't be corrupted
because it's just programming.

29:53.375 --> 29:54.418
She's a perfect fit.

29:55.419 --> 29:56.462
She's a robot?

29:57.171 --> 29:58.172
An android.

29:58.714 --> 30:01.717
She can handle a quadrillion functions
per second, and she can get us home.

30:02.176 --> 30:04.470
Fitz, that was not your call to make.

30:05.054 --> 30:07.556
Absolutely, it is. Whose is it?

30:08.182 --> 30:09.934
It's not yours.
You're not the director anymore.

30:10.100 --> 30:12.770
- I have as much say in this as you do.
- What are you so angry about?

30:12.937 --> 30:14.605
Because you used to make decisions
like that

30:14.772 --> 30:17.608
- all the time, and then you stepped down.
- I did what was best for S.H.I.E.L.D.

30:18.317 --> 30:21.153
Everybody is trying to do their best
to prevent another tragedy...

30:22.822 --> 30:24.073
like Lincoln.

30:25.908 --> 30:27.827
For you and Daisy,
that meant throwing in the towel,

30:28.118 --> 30:31.038
but we built Aida
to protect agents like him.

30:31.622 --> 30:32.915
I didn't throw in the towel.

30:33.082 --> 30:35.835
I ran an illegal spy agency
using powered operatives

30:36.001 --> 30:37.336
on American soil.

30:38.212 --> 30:40.089
Do you think the President loved that
about me?

30:41.131 --> 30:42.842
I had to step down

30:43.008 --> 30:44.510
so that you could all continue in
S.H.I.E.L.D.

30:44.677 --> 30:48.514
You handed it over to a director
who betrayed Simmons!

30:49.014 --> 30:53.477
He sent her off, God knows where!

30:56.397 --> 30:57.648
We were having an argument.

30:58.607 --> 31:00.317
Now she's out there, alone...

31:01.777 --> 31:02.862
and I'm gone.

31:07.116 --> 31:09.910
Listen to me. He would never hurt her.

31:11.078 --> 31:12.496
Everything's gonna be all right.

31:13.664 --> 31:14.874
We're gonna make sure of that.

31:20.337 --> 31:22.923
All right, well, I need you in this fight,
'cause I got to get back to her.

31:23.465 --> 31:24.842
I'm in this fight.

31:26.427 --> 31:28.679
I hope I've done the right thing.

31:39.398 --> 31:40.524
The pages are blank.

31:49.909 --> 31:51.118
Not to her.

32:02.004 --> 32:02.963
Okay.

32:15.017 --> 32:16.352
Thank you. Thank you.

32:17.186 --> 32:20.022
It's nice to meet you, Jemma Simmons.

32:20.606 --> 32:21.982
Yeah, of course.

32:23.067 --> 32:25.486
What's your name?

32:26.028 --> 32:28.030
- Jemma. Jemma!
- Thank you, Doctor.

32:29.031 --> 32:30.115
I think we're finished here.

32:30.366 --> 32:31.450
Jemma.

32:36.288 --> 32:37.456
On your left.

32:41.377 --> 32:42.419
Fair enough.

32:47.383 --> 32:48.384
I can't help you.

32:49.051 --> 32:50.094
Have fun.

32:51.095 --> 32:53.847
Please. I already told you where he is.

32:54.181 --> 32:55.349
What else do you want from me?

32:55.557 --> 32:59.061
I want you to pay... with your life.

32:59.269 --> 33:00.145
Hey!

33:01.397 --> 33:03.774
- Mack.
- No.

33:05.985 --> 33:07.277
You're smarter than that.

33:09.947 --> 33:10.990
You.

33:13.200 --> 33:15.869
I've been a voice in your head
all these years.

33:16.829 --> 33:21.458
Now, finally, we get to speak
face-to-face.

33:21.959 --> 33:23.210
I've wanted you gone.

33:24.920 --> 33:26.380
But our work isn't done.

33:26.630 --> 33:28.966
Eli is out there. We need to stop him.

33:29.216 --> 33:30.300
"We"?

33:31.468 --> 33:32.845
There is no we.

33:33.971 --> 33:35.681
Your time is over.

33:36.181 --> 33:37.933
No, no, no. Please, don't kill me!

33:41.645 --> 33:42.730
Stay.

33:43.355 --> 33:45.941
We had a deal. You still owe me vengeance.

33:46.275 --> 33:49.069
Your neighbourhood is soaked in the blood
I spilled for you.

33:50.070 --> 33:53.532
None of that matters if I don't take down
the monster behind all of this...

33:55.826 --> 33:56.910
Eli.

33:58.704 --> 33:59.705
He's my blood.

34:01.749 --> 34:03.083
He will meet me, too.

34:06.420 --> 34:07.588
It's getting darker,

34:08.005 --> 34:09.089
like it's pulling us down.

34:09.255 --> 34:11.175
All right, guys, we can finish
the assembly from here.

34:11.467 --> 34:12.801
Clear this part of the building.

34:14.928 --> 34:17.723
Alternating probe and coupling lasers,

34:17.889 --> 34:21.351
built exactly to your specifications
at 593.5 nanometres.

34:38.577 --> 34:42.331
I'm building an inter-dimensional gateway
with an android I've created.

34:42.539 --> 34:44.166
If this works, I could die happy.

34:44.416 --> 34:47.043
We've put our faith in a robot
who says she hears ghosts.

34:47.377 --> 34:49.670
If it fails, you might die quickly.

34:50.339 --> 34:51.422
They're here.

34:52.674 --> 34:53.884
I promise.

35:00.891 --> 35:02.059
How is she doing that?

35:03.477 --> 35:05.062
I'm not even gonna pretend to know.

35:08.941 --> 35:10.859
May, I really wish you could see this.

35:13.570 --> 35:14.947
Coulson, watch out!

35:22.412 --> 35:24.748
Come on! Fight! You got to fight!

35:25.165 --> 35:26.166
I'm pulling!

35:27.543 --> 35:28.752
We're running out of time!

35:41.473 --> 35:42.683
Is she doing anything?

35:43.016 --> 35:44.017
I hope so.

35:46.520 --> 35:48.063
We're running out of time.

35:51.441 --> 35:53.360
You can't hold on to Mack's body forever.

35:53.610 --> 35:54.736
He's a good man.

35:55.195 --> 35:56.780
He doesn't have vengeance in him.

35:57.114 --> 36:01.326
It's not ideal, but Mack,
he has a lot of pain.

36:01.702 --> 36:03.036
He lost hope.

36:03.495 --> 36:06.331
I could survive off his pain for years.

36:06.665 --> 36:08.834
I know where you're being dragged down to.

36:09.835 --> 36:11.461
I've escaped it before.

36:12.296 --> 36:13.338
Mack?

36:14.047 --> 36:15.340
You need to come with me.

36:16.383 --> 36:17.718
I'm never going back.

36:29.354 --> 36:31.899
Mack, don't do this. That's not you.

36:32.941 --> 36:35.527
- You got to fight it.
- We made a deal.

36:37.946 --> 36:39.448
I ain't going nowhere.

36:45.829 --> 36:46.997
Ready, Aida?

37:04.014 --> 37:05.974
- No, they're in trouble!
- No!

37:06.225 --> 37:07.726
That would be a deadly mistake.

37:10.979 --> 37:12.064
Hold on, Phil!

37:17.611 --> 37:18.612
Come on!

37:20.030 --> 37:21.740
- Fight it!
- That's it! Fight!

37:21.990 --> 37:24.910
Let's go home.

37:30.374 --> 37:32.834
We did it, Fitz! We did it! We did it,
Fitz!

37:33.085 --> 37:34.586
We did it. Thank you.

37:37.214 --> 37:38.465
I knew you weren't gone.

37:41.385 --> 37:42.469
I know.

37:46.890 --> 37:47.891
You're right.

37:48.141 --> 37:51.853
I won't survive this without you,
but the truth is, you need me, too.

37:53.355 --> 37:54.606
We had a deal!

37:55.232 --> 37:56.441
How about a new one?

37:57.776 --> 37:59.569
Give me my vengeance on Eli.

38:00.320 --> 38:01.655
Settle my score,

38:02.656 --> 38:03.824
and I'll settle yours...

38:05.409 --> 38:06.618
all of yours!

38:17.296 --> 38:18.338
Mack?

38:20.090 --> 38:21.133
What happened?

38:25.512 --> 38:29.641
Robbie, that... that thing,
he took it out of me.

38:30.767 --> 38:32.060
Are you all right?

38:33.312 --> 38:35.147
Some of those things you said... you...

38:36.231 --> 38:37.316
you said you were in pain.

38:37.566 --> 38:40.736
No, it's just a rough day.

38:42.029 --> 38:43.071
I'm okay.

38:44.031 --> 38:45.115
Good.

38:47.784 --> 38:48.994
Where'd he take it?

38:52.831 --> 38:53.915
Hell.

38:55.917 --> 38:57.044
Mace... where is he?

38:58.795 --> 39:01.631
Mace! I know what you did.
Where the hell's Simmons?

39:01.798 --> 39:05.218
Agent Fitz, it's good to see you back.
Simmons will be here in a moment.

39:05.385 --> 39:08.597
Yeah, well, I've heard that line before.
I want to know where she's coming from...

39:10.307 --> 39:11.558
- 'cause I heard you on the...
- Fitz...

39:11.850 --> 39:12.851
- Where is he?
- Jemma?

39:13.018 --> 39:14.311
What? Fitz!

39:15.270 --> 39:16.396
Jemma.

39:26.573 --> 39:27.866
So, Aida...

39:30.077 --> 39:31.328
I know what you're gonna say.

39:32.412 --> 39:35.165
- I know you don't approve.
- Not my call.

39:35.749 --> 39:37.709
But you promised
you wouldn't open the Darkhold.

39:38.460 --> 39:39.711
You broke that promise.

39:41.755 --> 39:42.798
Damn straight.

39:45.092 --> 39:46.259
You know, when this is over...

39:48.220 --> 39:49.763
you and I have a bottle
of Haig to open.

40:01.191 --> 40:04.194
Mack is still upstairs.
I think he needs some time alone.

40:04.861 --> 40:06.696
- Is he okay?
- Don't know.

40:07.572 --> 40:09.366
- Bad day.
- And Robbie?

40:12.494 --> 40:16.957
He pulled the Rider out of Mack,
but he's gone, I think.

40:17.499 --> 40:18.542
I'm sorry.

40:19.835 --> 40:21.920
Yeah, well, what he did should count
for something.

40:22.254 --> 40:25.465
Mack got a lead on his uncle,
possible location.

40:25.799 --> 40:28.635
We'll follow it up, make sure
he doesn't hurt anyone else.

40:29.928 --> 40:30.929
Good.

41:06.631 --> 41:08.175
I thought I'd be seeing you.

41:16.892 --> 41:18.351
And I know you're not alone.

41:28.445 --> 41:30.197
Want to help settle my last score?

41:39.164 --> 41:40.916
<i>I saved the day</i>

41:41.458 --> 41:43.043
<i>I saved the day</i>

41:43.752 --> 41:45.462
<i>Don't be dismayed</i>

41:46.129 --> 41:50.175
<i>The friends we made
I finally made Aida</i>

41:51.635 --> 41:52.802
<i>The friends we made</i>

41:54.179 --> 41:55.388
<i>Don't be dismayed</i>

41:56.306 --> 41:57.516
No, I've said that already.

41:58.266 --> 42:00.352
Uh, what else rhymes with "Aida"?

42:00.769 --> 42:02.103
<i>She's not a grenade</i>

42:02.479 --> 42:03.647
No.

42:04.397 --> 42:07.776
Ugh! Aida, what else rhymes with "Aida"?

42:08.652 --> 42:09.986
Huh?

42:10.737 --> 42:12.155
<i>Parade...</i>

42:12.531 --> 42:14.533
Oh, never mind.

42:15.909 --> 42:18.036
<i>I saved the day</i>
