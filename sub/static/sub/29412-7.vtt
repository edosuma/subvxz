do more than
treat her infection...

with the modified ADA gene.

15:30.530 --> 15:31.831

she's cured.

15:31.864 --> 15:33.500

she dies.

an acute toxic reaction.

my entire software system

I upgraded it.

There.

25:12.478 --> 25:14.080

my appointments.

to a schedule.

prescriptions.

we needed to discuss.

in her purse?

25:30.296 --> 25:32.799
It's a squirrel.
It's a Northern
flying squirrel.

You weren't gonna fix
whatever issues she has

25:34.634 --> 25:35.668
with an extra
five minutes.

25:35.702 --> 25:38.805
It's my clinic, okay?
I decide how it runs!

25:41.874 --> 25:43.142
Okay.

25:44.811 --> 25:47.379
I thought that
you wanted me
to be a part of it.

25:47.413 --> 25:49.682
You know,
to actually help
and to...

25:51.317 --> 25:52.985
Make changes,
have opinions.

25:53.019 --> 25:56.155
But if that's not
what you want,
then I...

25:56.188 --> 25:57.657
I should do
what I promised...

25:59.158 --> 26:00.459
I quit.

26:05.765 --> 26:07.199

I'm sorry.

26:27.386 --> 26:29.856
I... I shouldn't
have said any of that.

26:34.526 --> 26:36.729
I lost somebody recently.

26:40.199 --> 26:42.068
And it hurts.

26:42.101 --> 26:43.602
A lot.

26:44.871 --> 26:48.775
And I took it out on you,
and that is unfair.

26:54.080 --> 26:56.148
But if you don't
have this surgery,

26:57.784 --> 27:02.755
you won't ever drink
another slushy
at a baseball game.

27:02.789 --> 27:06.558
Or feel the wind in your hair
when you speed down the road.

27:06.592 --> 27:07.727
Or...

27:09.395 --> 27:11.030
Or touch a naked woman.

27:11.063 --> 27:13.265

27:16.903 --> 27:17.937
Now, this sucks.

27:17.970 --> 27:19.471
It really, really sucks.

27:20.572 --> 27:23.409
But it will get
less sucky.

27:27.613 --> 27:29.749
And the part
that hurts
so much right now

27:29.782 --> 27:32.618
will start
to hurt less.

27:36.555 --> 27:37.957
And life goes on,

27:37.990 --> 27:39.959
and you will have
wonderful moments,

27:39.992 --> 27:41.828
and you will have
sucky moments.

27:43.162 --> 27:44.764
And it will be
your life.

27:45.832 --> 27:47.934
And it'll be a good life,

even be a great life.

ground me forever

one last day of fun.

to reintroduce the SFADs.
