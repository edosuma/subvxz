WEBVTT

00:07.250 --> 00:09.050
I am actually
kind of into you...

00:09.085 --> 00:11.953
<i>Previously on</i> House of Lies...

00:11.988 --> 00:13.988
So yeah, I would
go out with you.

00:14.024 --> 00:14.989
You can get me a TED Talk?

00:15.025 --> 00:15.990
Yeah, the executive curator,

00:16.026 --> 00:17.225
she's my friend.

00:17.260 --> 00:18.826
Well, they've asked me
to give a TED Talk, so...

00:18.862 --> 00:19.727
Are you giving a TED Talk,

00:19.763 --> 00:21.496
or like a special TED Talk?

00:21.531 --> 00:22.463
Could you imagine

00:22.499 --> 00:24.632
<i>stepping off the hamster wheel?</i>

00:24.668 --> 00:26.634
Are we jumping in?

00:26.670 --> 00:27.902
Getting K and A all sexy
for Skip Galweather

00:27.938 --> 00:30.171
<i>and the Kohl brothers.</i>

00:30.206 --> 00:32.941
From this point on,
it is big game fishing only!

<i>Now, kiddies,</i>

00:38.114 --> 00:40.315
<i>you remember back in the day
you all had a guy in your dorm</i>

00:40.350 --> 00:42.817
who sold you those
sketch dime bags of weed

00:42.852 --> 00:45.086
from his shitty hydroponic
plants he grew in his bathtub?

00:45.121 --> 00:46.287
100%.

00:46.323 --> 00:47.522
His name was Jonah.

00:47.557 --> 00:48.890
I think it may have
been the closest

00:48.925 --> 00:50.124
I've ever been
to blowing a dude.

00:50.160 --> 00:52.961
Mmm, his name was Octavio.

00:52.996 --> 00:55.296
- Octavio.
- I definitely blew him.

00:55.332 --> 00:56.831
Spencer.
And I reported him.

00:56.866 --> 00:58.166
He was a menace.

00:58.201 --> 00:59.701
Well, I want you
to erase all memories

00:59.736 --> 01:04.305
you have of rolling papers and
Pink Floyd posters on the wall,

01:04.340 --> 01:06.641
'cause these Washington
State weed slingers,

01:06.676 --> 01:08.176
they're
like Ganja Walmart.

01:08.211 --> 01:09.811
I got to say, even
Wall Street's taking notice.

01:09.846 --> 01:11.946
Yeah, you're goddamn right,
and they should.

01:11.982 --> 01:13.848
It's one of the fastest growing
industries in the nation.

01:13.883 --> 01:16.517
$3 billion dollars in
revenue alone last year.

01:16.553 --> 01:17.719
And that's a "B," y'all!

01:17.754 --> 01:18.820
Sweet Jesus!

01:18.855 --> 01:21.055
That buys a lot
of Burning Man swag.

01:21.091 --> 01:22.190
Cha-ching!

01:25.328 --> 01:27.295
Whoa. Seriously?

01:29.866 --> 01:31.966
This is a lot less patchouli
and a whole lot

01:32.002 --> 01:33.534
more full automatic weapons
than Jonah carried.

01:36.773 --> 01:38.006
I'll need to see
all your IDs.

01:38.041 --> 01:39.374
- Yes, sir, here we go.
- Okay.

01:40.410 --> 01:41.909
Hi.

01:43.013 --> 01:45.013
There you go.

01:47.817 --> 01:49.684
Pleasant.

01:49.719 --> 01:52.420
Well, I for one will not be
partaking while we're here.

01:54.591 --> 01:56.224
Well, don't you
want to know why?

01:57.627 --> 01:59.227
I'm keeping my temple pristine!

02:00.630 --> 02:02.997
For two days from now!

02:03.033 --> 02:04.932
Come on, the TED Talk!

02:04.968 --> 02:06.267
I marked it in your
calendars weeks ago!

02:06.302 --> 02:07.668
Yeah, that reminds me.

02:07.704 --> 02:08.870
- Uh, Jeannie?
- Hmm?

02:08.905 --> 02:10.338
While we're here,
do your best

02:10.372 --> 02:11.773
to keep your little
temple pristine, okay?

02:11.808 --> 02:13.708
- Yes.
- Not this again.

02:13.743 --> 02:16.177
I am fine high!

02:16.212 --> 02:17.178
You are deeply,
deeply not fine.

02:17.213 --> 02:18.613
You're kidding.

02:18.648 --> 02:20.281
I'd rather get high
with Anne Hathaway.

02:20.316 --> 02:21.482
Very cute.

02:21.518 --> 02:23.851
Everybody gets a little chatty
when they're high!

02:23.887 --> 02:26.187
That's like saying Octomom
got a little pregnant.

02:26.222 --> 02:27.288
Oh...!

02:27.323 --> 02:28.556
- Big Daddy, can I get it?
- Alley-oop!

02:28.591 --> 02:30.491
Jeannie, please,
do other things, okay?

02:30.527 --> 02:32.727
Like drink or mainline heroin.

02:32.762 --> 02:33.795
Literally anything else.

02:33.830 --> 02:36.631
Step out of the car, sir.

02:36.666 --> 02:38.099
Oh, okay.

02:38.134 --> 02:40.468
No way.
I got you, Marty.

02:40.503 --> 02:42.603
I'm gonna get footage in case
he shoots you in the back.

02:42.639 --> 02:44.705
- Put the fucking phone away.
- Uh-uh.

02:44.741 --> 02:45.740
Sign here.

02:45.775 --> 02:47.075
Black lives matter.

02:47.110 --> 02:48.643
Sorry.

02:48.678 --> 02:50.845
Sorry for all
the military tactics.

02:50.880 --> 02:52.747
Come on,
who doesn't love machine guns?

02:52.782 --> 02:54.549
It's just that we handle
everything in cash.

02:54.584 --> 02:56.384
Ooh, not to mention
all of this weed

02:56.419 --> 02:57.885
just innocently sitting here.

02:57.921 --> 03:00.688
These backwards fucking banks
won't take us on as clients,

03:00.723 --> 03:02.790
because according
to federal law,

03:02.826 --> 03:05.793
this whole, beautiful, uh,

03:05.829 --> 03:09.397
spiritual, sensual operation

03:09.432 --> 03:11.399
- is criminal!
- Crazy.

03:11.434 --> 03:12.800
You know, the people,
they want salvation.

03:12.836 --> 03:14.402
It's the law
that can't catch up.

03:14.437 --> 03:15.536
- We can't have checkbooks.
- No.

03:15.572 --> 03:16.671
We can't even
have back accounts.

03:16.706 --> 03:18.773
No, we are the 99%.

03:18.808 --> 03:20.508
We are the checkbook-less.

03:20.543 --> 03:22.810
We are unprotected.

03:22.846 --> 03:24.212
We're naked.

03:24.247 --> 03:25.513
Well, you're wearing
$400 sneakers,

03:25.548 --> 03:26.848
- so you're doing okay.
- Hey, Doug?

03:26.883 --> 03:27.982
Well, l-listen.

03:28.017 --> 03:31.185
The man put
the people down in Ohio.

03:31.221 --> 03:33.621
That's not gonna happen with us,
'cause we got the power

03:33.656 --> 03:36.124
of the plant on our side.

03:36.159 --> 03:37.325
Mm-hmm, yeah.

03:37.360 --> 03:39.327
Last year, we sold our crops
by the ton, literally.

03:39.362 --> 03:40.595
And edibles on top of that.

03:40.630 --> 03:42.163
The world is changing.

03:42.198 --> 03:44.365
Humanity is changing.

03:44.400 --> 03:46.467
And like any people's
revolution, it takes time

03:46.503 --> 03:47.869
to change people's minds.

03:47.904 --> 03:49.470
- Mm-hmm.
- Their hearts.

03:49.506 --> 03:51.339
Their lives.

03:51.374 --> 03:54.008
Their reality.

03:54.043 --> 03:55.243
Come see my babies.
Come here! Come here!

03:55.278 --> 03:57.311
Yeah.

03:57.347 --> 03:59.614
Hello, bags of money.

03:59.649 --> 04:00.781
So you guys will be good
getting all your fees in cash?

04:00.817 --> 04:02.717
"Cash"?

04:02.752 --> 04:04.619
Cha-ching.

04:04.654 --> 04:05.820
Yeah, you smell that?

04:05.855 --> 04:07.989
Yeah, no, excuse me,
I'm not interested.

04:08.024 --> 04:10.158
Yeah, move.

04:10.193 --> 04:11.292
- Oh, it's like heaven.
- Smell?

04:11.327 --> 04:12.627
- No, no.
- You're not to smell.

04:12.662 --> 04:14.695
That, sir, smells
like money, money, money.

04:14.731 --> 04:17.031
Actually, that is
the smell of civil rights.

04:17.065 --> 04:18.466
Of a movement.

04:18.500 --> 04:20.233
Of all the soldiers
who lost their lives

04:20.269 --> 04:21.402
- in the War on Drugs.
- And also

04:21.437 --> 04:23.571
- it has made us millions.
- Right.

04:23.606 --> 04:25.740
In the words of Fidel,
"Capitalism is repugnant."

04:25.775 --> 04:27.074
It causes hypocrisy

04:27.110 --> 04:30.978
and war and...

04:31.014 --> 04:31.979
I'm sorry.

04:32.015 --> 04:33.648
Is he quoting Castro?

04:33.683 --> 04:36.317
Didn't I see, like, a gazillion
American dollars roll by?

04:36.352 --> 04:39.020
You guys have all heard the
term "high as a kite," right?

04:39.055 --> 04:40.121
- I heard that one time.
- Yeah.

04:40.156 --> 04:41.556
- Yeah, yeah.
- What's more beautiful

04:41.591 --> 04:44.058
than a kite

04:44.093 --> 04:45.526
flying in the sky?

04:45.562 --> 04:47.428
- Maybe two kites?
- Jeannie naked?

04:47.463 --> 04:50.331
Different Jeannie.
You don't know her.

04:50.366 --> 04:52.366
Nothing...

04:52.402 --> 04:55.903
nothing is more
fucking beautiful!

04:55.939 --> 04:57.572
Starshine.

04:57.607 --> 04:59.707
Oh, honey.

05:01.311 --> 05:02.610
- I think we should keep moving.
- Okay, yeah.

05:02.645 --> 05:04.245
Come on, we'll show you
how revolution happens.

05:04.280 --> 05:06.280
Starshine.

05:07.584 --> 05:09.550
Here we have a sampling
of all of our products

05:09.586 --> 05:12.019
that we supply
to vendors around the state.

05:12.055 --> 05:13.688
Soon to be around the country

05:13.723 --> 05:15.356
with a little cooperation
from Congress.

05:15.391 --> 05:16.757
- Mm-hmm.
- This is fucking amazing!

05:16.793 --> 05:18.426
I'm glad you can
appreciate it.

05:18.461 --> 05:20.928
We package all our buds
by flavor.

05:20.964 --> 05:22.930
We have White Rhino, Agent
Orange, Island Sweet Skunk.

05:22.966 --> 05:25.566
- There's even a Kosher Kush.
- Mazel!

05:25.602 --> 05:27.702
And our gourmet edibles,
all with a real taste profile.

05:27.737 --> 05:29.136
I oversee the testing

05:29.172 --> 05:30.571
and focus group research
on every one.

05:30.607 --> 05:31.706
- Oh.
- Now, those are

05:31.741 --> 05:32.807
our Mindbomb Truffles.

05:32.842 --> 05:34.308
Our most potent.

05:34.344 --> 05:36.010
Feel like I'm in <i>Charlie
and the Chocolate Factory.</i>

05:36.045 --> 05:37.211
Whoa there,

05:37.247 --> 05:39.247
Veruca Salt,
these are off-limits for you.

05:39.282 --> 05:41.482
Clyde, I'm a big girl.
I can handle it.

05:41.517 --> 05:43.251
Really? How many friends have
you made when you were high?

05:43.286 --> 05:44.452
For the night?

05:44.487 --> 05:46.487
Tons.

05:48.157 --> 05:49.056
Want a little taste?

05:49.092 --> 05:50.124
No, don't...
stop that.

05:50.159 --> 05:51.525
Cut it out.
It's not funny.

05:51.561 --> 05:53.261
All right, I have one
shot with this talk.

05:53.296 --> 05:55.763
If I get it right,
it will be downloaded

05:55.798 --> 05:56.964
and shared on Facebook
ad infinitum.

05:57.000 --> 05:58.432
What is that...
Latin for "throw up"?

05:58.468 --> 05:59.900
I could be legendary...
think about it.

05:59.936 --> 06:01.936
I could be like that data
guy who swallowed a sword

06:01.971 --> 06:04.105
for no reason or the most
popular TED Talk of all...

06:04.140 --> 06:05.840
how orgasms work.

06:05.875 --> 06:07.842
Popular entirely because
it gave a scientific basis

06:07.877 --> 06:09.310
for jerking off.

06:09.345 --> 06:11.112
Yeah, like you needed a reason.

06:11.147 --> 06:12.947
Well, in the beginning, we were
trying to help cancer patients.

06:12.982 --> 06:14.448
We were trying-trying to help

06:14.484 --> 06:16.684
people suffering from epilepsy.

06:16.719 --> 06:18.352
But now we are

06:18.388 --> 06:21.455
changing the fucking world.

06:21.491 --> 06:23.824
No, we are... mavericks.

06:23.860 --> 06:25.159
Yeah.

06:25.194 --> 06:27.962
But these people did not come
here for a history lesson.

06:27.997 --> 06:29.530
Let's talk P&Ls,
shall we?

06:29.565 --> 06:31.766
Cha-ching.

06:31.801 --> 06:33.534
- Well, I feel enlightened already.
- Same.

06:33.569 --> 06:35.036
We're gonna spend
the rest of the day

06:35.071 --> 06:37.471
tightening up the valuations,
the modeling and then

06:37.507 --> 06:40.107
we would love to come
back to you, uh, over dinner

06:40.143 --> 06:42.310
and, uh, let you know
what we've come up with.

06:42.345 --> 06:43.544
Dinner would be nice.

06:43.579 --> 06:45.379
And by "tightening up
valuations,"

06:45.415 --> 06:47.915
you mean we get to try
all the marijuanas, Marty?

06:47.950 --> 06:50.418
Okay, look, I don't
want to be a buzzkill here.

06:50.453 --> 06:51.752
- Too late.
- You already are, Doug.

06:51.788 --> 06:54.488
But here's my concern...
if we partake in these samples,

06:54.524 --> 06:55.890
we could be delayed for days!

06:55.925 --> 06:57.325
And I've got to get back

06:57.360 --> 06:58.426
for, well, you know.

06:58.461 --> 07:00.027
We get it, we get it,
we get it.

07:00.063 --> 07:01.429
But we can't take it
on the plane.

07:01.464 --> 07:02.830
And it'd be wasteful
not to try it,

07:02.865 --> 07:03.831
- or rude really.
- Ah, shit.

07:03.866 --> 07:05.433
Should've called in sick.

07:05.468 --> 07:06.667
Marty, I feel sick.

07:06.703 --> 07:08.636
So, kiddies,
were you picking up

07:08.671 --> 07:10.771
on what Kush Lady
in there was putting down?

07:10.807 --> 07:12.373
Yeah, Kush Lady
wants to get rich.

07:12.408 --> 07:15.476
Correct, and Ron Zobel
has been working himself

07:15.511 --> 07:18.212
to get deep
into the pocket of MRJ.

07:18.247 --> 07:20.748
- MRJ the tobacco giant?
- And lobby.

07:20.783 --> 07:22.216
They've been looking
for a big play from us,

07:22.251 --> 07:23.884
and this could be
the mother lode.

07:23.920 --> 07:25.720
Clyde, call Ron Zobel.

07:25.755 --> 07:27.388
Tell him that we're
gonna land MRJ

07:27.423 --> 07:29.023
at the same time
we're gonna work Kush.

07:29.058 --> 07:30.858
Tell him that we've got the
biggest growers in the business,

07:30.893 --> 07:32.860
and they're ready
to sit down and deal.

07:32.895 --> 07:34.895
Are you fucking nuts?

07:34.931 --> 07:37.798
He asked respectfully.

07:37.834 --> 07:40.234
And he...

07:40.269 --> 07:42.036
picks up his phone.

07:42.071 --> 07:43.404
- Ron Zobel, please.
- You know, Marty,

07:43.439 --> 07:45.272
he's not wrong.
I mean, the clash

07:45.308 --> 07:47.608
between Big Tobacco and weed,
it's pretty insurmountable.

07:47.643 --> 07:49.910
Not to mention, these people
seem very committed

07:49.946 --> 07:52.213
to the movement... I mean,
"Capitalism is repugnant"?

07:52.248 --> 07:54.715
Yeah, I got to say
that one hurt a little.

07:54.751 --> 07:56.550
Kiddies, kiddies, kiddies,
have you not noticed

07:56.586 --> 07:58.185
that in any partnership,
there's always one person

07:58.221 --> 08:01.555
who's more swayed by greed
than the other?

08:01.591 --> 08:04.191
With the right argument,
I believe we can get Joy

08:04.227 --> 08:06.560
to come down off
of her husband's pot altar

08:06.596 --> 08:09.463
and get on board
with the biggest play possible.

08:09.499 --> 08:11.932
And the biggest play possible
is obviously Big Tobacco.

08:11.968 --> 08:14.201
So she's been going along,
but she's itching for more.

08:14.237 --> 08:15.803
Yes!
Clyde?

08:15.838 --> 08:17.638
- Bring it in.
- In two days?

08:17.673 --> 08:21.575
Children, we have been moving
the ball down the field

08:21.611 --> 08:24.912
prepared to settle for a
bullshit VC expansion field goal

08:24.947 --> 08:27.381
when we got Gronk in the corner
on a fade route for six.

08:27.417 --> 08:28.549
What?

08:28.584 --> 08:29.683
It's touchdown time, come on!

08:29.719 --> 08:30.684
- Let's get it!
- Let's get it!

08:30.720 --> 08:31.685
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

08:31.721 --> 08:32.753
- Let's rock it!
- Let's rock it!

08:32.789 --> 08:33.888
- Let's roll!
- Let's roll!

08:33.923 --> 08:34.889
- Let's get it!
- Let's get it!

08:34.924 --> 08:35.890
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

08:35.924 --> 08:37.091
- Let's rock it!
- Let's rock!

08:37.126 --> 08:38.159
- Let's go, put it in!
- Let's roll!

08:38.193 --> 08:39.159
K and A!

08:39.195 --> 08:41.261
And football, right?

08:41.297 --> 08:43.030
Ooh, this looks great.

08:43.065 --> 08:44.063
Word to the wise?

08:44.100 --> 08:45.599
The butter is infused.

08:45.635 --> 08:48.169
Word to the wise.

08:48.204 --> 08:50.070
The butter is delicious.

08:50.106 --> 08:52.373
I typically don't eat dinner,

08:52.408 --> 08:54.175
so nothing personal.

08:54.210 --> 08:56.710
But don't worry, I smoked
plenty of, uh, the pot,

08:56.746 --> 08:58.446
uh, before, so...

08:58.481 --> 09:00.314
Oh, yeah, love me
some of that,

09:00.349 --> 09:03.350
uh, the sweet Mary Jane.

09:03.386 --> 09:04.785
And so I'm very high.
High as a...

09:04.821 --> 09:06.821
- They get it. Hey, Jeannie?
- Hmm?

09:06.856 --> 09:08.289
You do understand
that the edibles

09:08.324 --> 09:10.591
are more potent
than the smoke, correct?

09:10.626 --> 09:12.293
Hmm!

09:12.328 --> 09:13.427
Ugh, it's like
a fucking horror movie.

09:13.463 --> 09:15.930
Food and pot together
in the rabid claws

09:15.965 --> 09:17.164
of Jeannie
van der Hooven.

09:17.200 --> 09:18.466
We've seen every kind

09:18.501 --> 09:20.334
of high there is,
and we embrace it.

09:20.369 --> 09:21.802
It's true.

09:21.838 --> 09:24.572
It is our privilege

09:24.607 --> 09:27.074
and our honor
to experience your bliss.

09:28.077 --> 09:29.677
And she was
inside me

09:29.712 --> 09:30.978
and then she
was inside,

09:31.013 --> 09:33.147
and then she just came out.

09:33.182 --> 09:35.182
You know, we get it,
we get it, we-we do.

09:35.218 --> 09:36.984
Is-is she always... like this?

09:37.019 --> 09:37.985
Oh, this is level one.

09:38.020 --> 09:39.854
- This has just started.
- It gets worse.

09:39.889 --> 09:41.455
This is nice.

09:41.491 --> 09:42.890
Can we just get real for a
second, you know what I mean?

09:42.925 --> 09:44.291
Like, fuck the
"consultantspeak."

09:44.327 --> 09:45.960
- You know?
- We get you, Marty.

09:45.995 --> 09:47.161
We do.

09:47.196 --> 09:49.864
And we get that you get us.

09:51.667 --> 09:53.701
You're a fuckin' maverick.

09:53.736 --> 09:57.037
Well, I do... and I am.

09:57.073 --> 09:58.506
You guys,
you guys!

09:58.541 --> 09:59.907
You guys.

09:59.942 --> 10:02.276
I can feel you
being free

10:02.311 --> 10:03.878
right now.

10:04.914 --> 10:06.380
Wait, wait.

10:06.415 --> 10:08.115
What if everyone in the world

10:08.150 --> 10:09.650
blinked at the exact same time?

10:11.888 --> 10:12.887
Now.

10:13.890 --> 10:14.889
Now.

10:16.225 --> 10:17.157
Now.

10:17.193 --> 10:18.225
You know, it's interesting.

10:18.261 --> 10:20.160
What you do here
actually reminds me

10:20.196 --> 10:22.363
of the third commandment
of TED Talk:

10:22.398 --> 10:24.698
thou shalt reveal thy curiosity
and thy passion.

10:24.734 --> 10:25.733
Mm-hmm.

10:25.768 --> 10:28.068
These are broke.
These are broken.

10:28.104 --> 10:29.103
So I feel you, bro.

10:29.138 --> 10:29.937
Hey, can you get this guy
to shut the fuck up?

10:29.972 --> 10:31.739
Who you talking about?

10:31.774 --> 10:33.774
I don't think so.

10:33.809 --> 10:36.110
Look, here's the thing:

10:36.145 --> 10:38.212
the banks won't touch you.

10:38.247 --> 10:39.280
Who gives a fuck?

10:39.315 --> 10:40.514
Fuck those guys, okay?
I can find you money.

10:40.550 --> 10:41.949
There's a lot of investors

10:41.984 --> 10:44.218
that will back small
businesses like yours.

10:44.253 --> 10:45.352
Sure, your competitors,
they're gonna

10:45.388 --> 10:47.021
probably align themselves
with much bigger,

10:47.056 --> 10:49.623
you know, consortiums,
multinationals,

10:49.659 --> 10:51.225
that-that kind of thing.

10:51.260 --> 10:53.394
And you... God, we hope
you don't get buried,

10:53.429 --> 10:55.262
but the important
thing is

10:55.298 --> 10:56.764
that your integrity

10:56.799 --> 10:58.299
remains, right?

10:58.334 --> 10:59.767
Your-your mission
remains intact.

10:59.802 --> 11:01.802
The mission succeeds,

11:01.837 --> 11:03.137
freedom succeeds.

11:03.172 --> 11:04.405
Goddamn right.

11:05.508 --> 11:06.874
Anyone for coffee?

11:06.909 --> 11:08.475
Yeah.

11:08.511 --> 11:10.511
Uh, I'll... I'll help out.

11:15.952 --> 11:17.952
I could use
some fresh air.

11:19.355 --> 11:21.121
Yeah?
Okay.

11:21.157 --> 11:22.489
- No, no, no, no.
- No.

11:22.525 --> 11:23.490
Don't leave me with her.

11:23.526 --> 11:24.491
Take care of her.

11:24.527 --> 11:25.793
Do you want some coffee?

11:25.828 --> 11:28.095
You know why I'm in here, Joy.

11:28.130 --> 11:29.229
Okay.

11:29.265 --> 11:30.864
What's the better play?

11:33.603 --> 11:34.568
Hey, listen, okay?

11:34.604 --> 11:36.370
Don't fly off the handle.

11:36.405 --> 11:37.738
Big Tobacco.

11:37.773 --> 11:39.139
Tobacco?

11:39.175 --> 11:41.141
I see what you need.

11:41.177 --> 11:42.176
Earplugs?

11:44.547 --> 11:45.980
You and Clyde.

11:46.015 --> 11:47.181
That's the love story.

11:47.216 --> 11:48.916
No, I don't think so.
I see...

11:48.951 --> 11:50.384
inner children.

11:50.419 --> 11:51.819
And they want the same thing.

11:51.854 --> 11:53.621
They both just want to...

11:53.656 --> 11:55.456
fill the holes, you know,
where the love goes.

11:58.694 --> 11:59.994
You could fill
each other's holes.

12:00.029 --> 12:01.629
I mean, I'm not saying

12:01.664 --> 12:04.431
I've never thought
about it, but no.

12:06.969 --> 12:08.502
Does anyone have a guitar?

12:08.537 --> 12:10.037
Big Tobacco is
a fucking monster, okay?

12:10.072 --> 12:11.138
They're the biggest fucking
monster of them all.

12:11.173 --> 12:12.640
- Yeah.
- But they have all the money

12:12.675 --> 12:13.774
that you could ever want,

12:13.809 --> 12:15.075
to do anything
that you want with.

12:15.111 --> 12:17.711
Fuck handing out post-chemo
joints and lollipops;

12:17.747 --> 12:18.879
you guys could
fucking cure cancer.

12:18.914 --> 12:20.547
But we're growing, we're steady.

12:20.583 --> 12:21.715
Oh, my God!

12:21.751 --> 12:23.684
My eyes feel like
I just got them today.

12:23.719 --> 12:24.685
Oh, <i>my</i> God,

12:24.720 --> 12:26.353
could you please...
Doug, grab her.

12:26.389 --> 12:27.354
Oh, Marty, I need a break!

12:27.390 --> 12:28.856
Just grab her.

12:28.891 --> 12:30.724
Listen, I know that
you guys are growing, okay?

12:30.760 --> 12:34.161
But I'm talking about $100
million dollars, minimum, here.

12:34.196 --> 12:35.663
And you can be hands-on
with the expansion

12:35.698 --> 12:37.031
as all the state
and federal bullshit

12:37.066 --> 12:38.298
gets worked out

12:38.334 --> 12:39.800
and you'll have
the biggest voice behind you

12:39.835 --> 12:41.168
to push through Congress, okay?

12:41.203 --> 12:43.137
Big Tobacco has
the infrastructure,

12:43.172 --> 12:45.205
you guys have the street cred

12:45.241 --> 12:47.574
and the culture.

12:47.610 --> 12:48.809
You'd be the
Starbucks of pot.

12:48.844 --> 12:50.077
That's the play, Joy.

12:50.112 --> 12:52.312
And it's the play
that Max should want, too.

12:52.348 --> 12:54.181
They want you to think
it's about the money

12:54.216 --> 12:57.084
and the power and the
suits and the cars...

12:57.119 --> 12:59.019
- Fuck that.
- That's the opiate.

12:59.055 --> 13:01.088
It's like having a Black Card

13:01.123 --> 13:02.756
makes up for
having a black soul.

13:02.792 --> 13:04.224
I have a fucking Black Card

13:04.260 --> 13:06.994
and honestly
I don't think I'm happy.

13:07.029 --> 13:07.995
Happiness...

13:08.030 --> 13:09.830
the path to salvation...

13:09.865 --> 13:13.100
can only come from
Earth feeding you.

13:13.135 --> 13:14.201
Fuck, yes!

13:14.236 --> 13:15.803
Take me through it
from the beginning.

13:15.838 --> 13:18.272
I want to hear the whole fucking
thing... chapter one, go.

13:18.307 --> 13:21.141
God... It just-just
feels like we're giving in

13:21.177 --> 13:22.976
to everything
we've fought against.

13:23.012 --> 13:25.179
I know, but don't
do that, okay?

13:25.214 --> 13:27.414
You're letting your
feelings tell you a story.

13:27.450 --> 13:30.718
You can't let feelings
make business decisions.

13:30.753 --> 13:32.286
Okay? This isn't...

13:32.321 --> 13:33.954
this isn't greed.

13:33.989 --> 13:34.955
It's smart.

13:34.990 --> 13:37.191
Yeah.

13:37.226 --> 13:38.592
History's greatest
thinkers got high.

13:38.627 --> 13:40.060
- Shakespeare...
- What?

13:40.096 --> 13:42.096
Joan of Arc,
George Washington...

13:42.131 --> 13:44.264
<i>and</i> he invented peanut butter.

13:44.300 --> 13:46.066
Wow! Although
I don't think so.

13:46.102 --> 13:47.301
I think that's
George Washington Carver.

13:47.336 --> 13:48.602
Well, he wrote
the Constitution, so...

13:48.637 --> 13:50.504
- Same thing.
- Look, the point is,

13:50.539 --> 13:52.539
all the greatest innovations
come from the plant.

13:52.575 --> 13:54.108
You've got
hemp clothes,

13:54.143 --> 13:55.542
uh, hemp birdseed,

13:55.578 --> 13:56.877
um, Bible pages

13:56.912 --> 13:58.045
that were

13:58.080 --> 13:59.880
written... on...

13:59.915 --> 14:00.981
- Paper. Hemp.
- Hemp probably. Hemp.

14:01.016 --> 14:02.216
You were talking
about hemp, yeah.

14:02.251 --> 14:03.484
- Hemp probably. Yeah.
- Uh, but, you know,

14:03.519 --> 14:06.120
it's a matter of time,
it is, till we got cars,

14:06.155 --> 14:07.755
uh... airplanes...

14:07.790 --> 14:08.756
Hey. Riddle me this.

14:08.791 --> 14:10.758
How does hemp hold up against,

14:10.793 --> 14:12.459
- say, straw?
- What's he doing?

14:12.495 --> 14:13.627
Did Joan of Arc
wear hemp?

14:13.662 --> 14:14.895
Because that would be insane
if it were a helmet.

14:14.930 --> 14:15.963
Oh, I've always
wanted to know that.

14:15.998 --> 14:17.097
No, I get it.

14:17.133 --> 14:18.565
You guys, you bring me out here,

14:18.601 --> 14:21.168
you get me to talk about the
mother plant while this fuck

14:21.203 --> 14:22.469
- works my fucking wife in there?
- Oh, shit.

14:22.505 --> 14:23.637
No, I want to talk about
your conspiracy theories.

14:23.672 --> 14:25.072
Just hang in there.
Set both of your feet.

14:25.107 --> 14:26.373
- All right? You're right.
- Hey.

14:26.408 --> 14:28.242
Hey, he is filling your
head with toxic shit.

14:28.277 --> 14:29.443
Marty, this is...

14:29.478 --> 14:31.044
Sweetie, I know
what you're gonna say,

14:31.080 --> 14:32.746
but tobacco's play
is unavoidable, okay?

14:32.782 --> 14:34.348
No, no, no, no,

14:34.383 --> 14:35.349
no, no, no.

14:35.384 --> 14:36.617
We don't eat dogs.

14:36.652 --> 14:37.951
He asked me to.

14:37.987 --> 14:40.687
You can't just eat
everything that asks you to.

14:40.723 --> 14:42.256
Are you selling us out?

14:42.291 --> 14:43.624
This is our legacy, baby,
this is our fucking life.

14:43.659 --> 14:44.858
Are you prepared
to lose our life?

14:44.894 --> 14:46.827
'Cause that's what's
going to happen.

14:46.862 --> 14:48.095
Look at history.

14:48.130 --> 14:49.129
Anheuser-Busch came in

14:49.165 --> 14:51.165
and made an empire
after Prohibition.

14:51.200 --> 14:53.267
They totally erased the
mom-and-pop businesses like us.

14:53.302 --> 14:54.868
I don't even
recognize you right now.

14:54.904 --> 14:55.869
Where are you?

14:55.905 --> 14:57.704
It's still us, okay?

14:57.740 --> 14:59.206
We're still mavericks.

14:59.241 --> 15:00.774
- Yeah?
- I just think we should

15:00.810 --> 15:02.376
open our minds to it, you know?

15:02.411 --> 15:04.978
We can use the system
to beat the system, okay?

15:05.014 --> 15:06.213
All right, you know what? Fine.

15:06.248 --> 15:07.214
I'll take a meeting.

15:07.249 --> 15:08.982
Doesn't mean I'm saying yes.

15:09.018 --> 15:11.185
And could you please
put my fucking dog down?

15:17.193 --> 15:18.392
Oh, hey, you would know.

15:18.427 --> 15:19.493
Is this
a load-bearing wall, here?

15:19.528 --> 15:21.962
You, uh, picturing
a Marty-less world, Ron?

15:21.997 --> 15:24.832
Imagination is
actualization, Marty.

15:24.867 --> 15:27.167
Yech. Feel like
I'm trapped in a rental car

15:27.203 --> 15:28.569
with Mr. TED Talk

15:28.604 --> 15:30.204
spouting his, uh, you know,
sound bite bullshit.

15:30.239 --> 15:31.672
Don't touch my things.

15:31.707 --> 15:34.208
T-minus two hours
and counting.

15:36.212 --> 15:37.711
I feel okay.

15:37.746 --> 15:39.012
Had a bit too much coffee.

15:39.048 --> 15:40.781
But, uh, so, listen.
Uh, good news.

15:40.816 --> 15:43.417
I've got them to tape off
three seats for you guys,

15:43.452 --> 15:44.985
but they're expecting
an at-capacity crowd,

15:45.020 --> 15:46.186
so I'd get there
at least 30 minutes early.

15:46.222 --> 15:47.387
Which part of this is

15:47.423 --> 15:49.423
- the good news?
- Well, I got to save you...

15:49.458 --> 15:50.691
Oh. Okay.

15:50.726 --> 15:52.292
Well, 20 minutes early,
all right?

15:52.328 --> 15:55.195
But then I can't guarantee
anything after...

15:55.231 --> 15:56.930
On time.

15:56.966 --> 15:58.565
Get there on time, you know
how to manage your schedule.

15:58.601 --> 16:00.167
Wish me luck.

16:02.204 --> 16:03.670
So MRJ is confirmed
for tomorrow morning.

16:03.706 --> 16:05.405
Took some serious
arm-twisting,

16:05.441 --> 16:07.107
since they wanted a few
months to run numbers first.

16:07.142 --> 16:08.442
Well, that's
great, Ron.

16:08.477 --> 16:10.711
Okay? 'Cause this is
all gonna be about timing.

16:10.746 --> 16:13.580
Kush Vistas has too much time
to stroll down memory lane,

16:13.616 --> 16:14.915
- we're gonna miss this window.
- Mmm.

16:14.950 --> 16:17.017
Big Weed makin' a baby
with Big Tabaccy.

16:18.420 --> 16:19.519
How much is Skip Galweather

16:19.555 --> 16:21.054
gonna love this
little cutie pie, eh?

16:21.090 --> 16:23.290
Well, it's gonna be a big,
old, fat baby, isn't it?

16:23.325 --> 16:24.424
Hey, Ron?

16:24.460 --> 16:25.525
Your guys are gonna come

16:25.561 --> 16:26.593
with their checkbooks
open, right?

16:26.629 --> 16:27.661
Don't worry about it. No, no.

16:27.696 --> 16:28.829
These guys are gonna
follow my lead.

16:28.864 --> 16:30.030
See, back in the day,

16:30.065 --> 16:31.999
I saved Syd Black's ass
during the whole

16:32.034 --> 16:34.868
"we believe nicotine
is not addictive" phase.

16:34.904 --> 16:36.970
Ugh, God...
You are a bad man, Ron Zobel.

16:37.006 --> 16:39.439
Well, game recognize game, baby.

16:41.410 --> 16:43.210
Excuse me. Sorry.

16:43.245 --> 16:45.579
Excuse me.
Excuse me.

16:47.049 --> 16:48.482
I feel like I'm
about to watch

16:48.517 --> 16:50.417
a tiny Christian
get eaten by a lion.

16:50.452 --> 16:51.451
Ooh...

16:51.487 --> 16:53.754
I'm feeling funny
in my naughty place.

16:53.789 --> 16:55.155
Hey, guys,
turn your phones off.

16:57.000 --> 17:03.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

17:05.733 --> 17:07.800
This is gonna be
the greatest TED Talk ever.

17:14.542 --> 17:16.910
Big Bird's big beak... ah.

17:18.012 --> 17:19.112
<i>♪ Mi mi mo mo moo ♪</i>

17:19.147 --> 17:20.146
<i>♪ Mi mi mo mo moo... ♪</i>

17:20.182 --> 17:21.315
Tess.

17:21.349 --> 17:22.316
Oh, my God.

17:22.351 --> 17:23.583
- Hey.
- Hey, you okay?

17:23.618 --> 17:25.919
Yeah. Oh, God.
No, I'm...

17:25.954 --> 17:27.287
Because you don't look so great.

17:28.390 --> 17:29.356
You look freaked out.

17:29.391 --> 17:30.691
Come on, no.

17:30.726 --> 17:32.125
And your voice is
really, really high.

17:32.161 --> 17:33.593
Oh, God, maybe I'm
a little freaked out.

17:33.629 --> 17:35.262
- Okay. Okay.
- I don't know.

17:35.297 --> 17:36.897
Who am I kidding?
I'm a lot freaked out.

17:36.932 --> 17:38.131
It's all finally happening.

17:38.167 --> 17:39.366
I can't believe it,
I've been thinking

17:39.401 --> 17:40.534
about this moment
for so long and here it is.

17:40.569 --> 17:41.802
- Doug...
- Hmm?

17:41.837 --> 17:42.803
Deep breath.

17:42.838 --> 17:46.106
You'll be amazing.

17:46.141 --> 17:47.607
You are a dungeon master.

17:47.643 --> 17:48.875
You are a genius.

17:48.911 --> 17:50.410
I know that.

17:50.446 --> 17:52.946
But what if I'm a misunderstood
genius, like Carrot Top?

17:52.982 --> 17:55.615
- You fucking got this.
- Yeah?

17:55.651 --> 17:58.151
And I made a reservation at
Mr. Chow after, to celebrate.

17:58.187 --> 17:59.152
- Okay.
- Excuse me, sir.

17:59.188 --> 18:00.153
- Yeah.
- Okay.

18:00.189 --> 18:01.154
- Ready when you are.
- Right.

18:01.190 --> 18:03.056
Okay.

18:03.092 --> 18:04.558
- Okay, here you go.
- Here I go.

18:06.929 --> 18:08.895
Oh, boy.

18:22.444 --> 18:24.411
Show of hands.

18:24.446 --> 18:26.980
How-how many people
here think about orcs?

18:29.718 --> 18:31.018
Might be having a technical
difficulty with the mic.

18:31.053 --> 18:32.252
Are we on?

18:32.287 --> 18:33.520
How many people here
think about orcs?

18:33.555 --> 18:34.521
"Orcs."

18:34.556 --> 18:35.689
Uh, okay, how about this?

18:35.724 --> 18:36.857
Uh, you're shy,
you're nervous.

18:36.892 --> 18:38.191
Don't be.

18:38.227 --> 18:39.526
I'll cover my eyes.

18:39.561 --> 18:40.861
Now I can't see you.

18:40.896 --> 18:42.529
So you can all do it.

18:42.564 --> 18:44.765
I'm sure most of you have
your hands raised.

18:49.071 --> 18:50.370
So you can drop your h...

18:50.406 --> 18:52.706
Okay, so not that many.

18:52.741 --> 18:54.041
Okay.

18:54.076 --> 18:56.676
Today, I'm going
to share with you

18:56.712 --> 18:58.779
how to embrace
your authentic self

18:58.814 --> 19:01.615
by defeating
the level-nine orc of doubt

19:01.650 --> 19:04.451
that lives inside each
and every one of us.

19:04.486 --> 19:07.454
Correction:
"level-nine orcs."

19:07.489 --> 19:09.389
Orcs...!

19:10.759 --> 19:12.793
Dougy Doug, my man!

19:12.828 --> 19:15.028
Ah.

19:15.064 --> 19:17.597
Are you fucking
kidding me right now?

19:17.633 --> 19:19.733
So let's dig into Doug...

19:23.839 --> 19:26.773
Who here has ever been
defeated by an inner orc?

19:26.809 --> 19:28.108
What's that, destiny?

19:28.143 --> 19:29.910
I'll meet you there.

19:35.651 --> 19:38.118
Aah. Someone...

19:38.153 --> 19:40.287
This is not the floor
we worked on.

19:43.459 --> 19:46.626
The die itself
gives birth to you.

19:46.662 --> 19:48.295
That's what he was
building in the office.

19:48.330 --> 19:50.263
Get out of here.

19:52.301 --> 19:56.069
...how hard
I was trying...

19:56.105 --> 20:00.107
Please, dear God,
lubricate the bear.

20:00.142 --> 20:01.808
Namaste.

20:08.951 --> 20:09.916
Yeah... Fuck!

20:09.952 --> 20:11.084
Oh! Aah!

20:11.120 --> 20:13.687
I'm never gonna be able
to unsee this.

20:13.722 --> 20:15.655
Yeah, do it

20:15.691 --> 20:16.690
to the beat, do it
to the beat, Doug.

20:16.725 --> 20:17.991
That's it!

20:18.026 --> 20:19.593
Shit! That... No!

20:22.998 --> 20:24.664
So, in closing,

20:24.700 --> 20:28.902
if I can leave you
with just one thought,

20:28.937 --> 20:30.270
let it be this.

20:31.473 --> 20:34.441
In the quest to find
your authentic self,

20:34.476 --> 20:37.978
it is better to merge
powers with an orc

20:38.013 --> 20:39.212
than to fight it.

20:49.691 --> 20:51.324
Oh, wasn't that fucking great?

20:51.360 --> 20:54.327
Oh, that connected
with you?

20:57.833 --> 20:59.466
- Hey.
- OMG.

20:59.501 --> 21:00.800
Amazing, right?

21:00.836 --> 21:02.802
I mean, yes, definitely.

21:02.838 --> 21:04.571
- Aah.
- Come here.

21:04.606 --> 21:05.839
God.

21:05.874 --> 21:07.207
Uh, well,
look at this.

21:07.242 --> 21:09.209
Looks like I'm gonna have
to press flesh with the fans.

21:09.244 --> 21:10.710
Okay, um...

21:10.746 --> 21:12.045
but we should get
going, though,

21:12.080 --> 21:13.380
if we want to make our
reservation at Mr. Chow.

21:13.415 --> 21:14.881
Ah, yeah, Mr. Chow.

21:14.917 --> 21:17.250
I just think I need to spend
a little more time here

21:17.286 --> 21:19.553
and, um,
how about this: you go ahead,

21:19.588 --> 21:21.555
hold the table, and I will meet
you as soon as I can break away.

21:21.590 --> 21:22.589
<i>If</i> I can break away.

21:22.624 --> 21:23.590
If?

21:23.625 --> 21:25.091
Oh, that's Lily Wu.

21:25.127 --> 21:26.826
Producer of the talk.
I think she's looking for me.

21:26.862 --> 21:29.329
Lily! Hey, oh, where
are you running to?

21:29.364 --> 21:30.397
Hey, no, come
back here.

21:34.636 --> 21:36.269
Yes, he's right in front of me.
I'm gonna tell him right now.

21:36.305 --> 21:38.271
- Yes, Ron, tonight, yes.
- Wow.

21:38.307 --> 21:39.606
Okay.

21:39.641 --> 21:41.107
Marty, that
was Ron Zobel.

21:41.143 --> 21:42.275
Yeah.

21:42.311 --> 21:43.610
The meeting has
to move up, okay?

21:43.645 --> 21:45.445
The MRJ execs are leaving
on a red-eye tonight

21:45.480 --> 21:47.447
to go to Hong Kong, so if you
want this meeting to happen,

21:47.482 --> 21:49.883
it has to happen now, okay?

21:49.918 --> 21:51.785
Or they have a window
in eight months.

21:51.820 --> 21:54.454
So you get it?
What do you think?

21:54.489 --> 21:57.357
Marty.

21:58.727 --> 22:00.360
Marty?

22:18.313 --> 22:20.046
We're an
American tradition.

22:20.082 --> 22:23.416
Oh, so killing your
customers is traditional.

22:23.452 --> 22:24.751
Un-fucking-believable.

22:24.786 --> 22:25.819
Marty.

22:25.854 --> 22:28.154
Do you have a
thought on this?

22:28.190 --> 22:31.625
Must be nice living in a goddamn
unicorn-and-fairies wet dream.

22:31.660 --> 22:32.659
Oh, my God, this guy.
Is this guy for real?

22:32.694 --> 22:33.660
Yeah, well, at least
we don't sell murder.

22:33.695 --> 22:35.762
I mean, your hair is like silk.

22:35.797 --> 22:36.730
'Cause if we make the product...

22:36.765 --> 22:38.965
- I smoke to get high.
- Marty.

22:39.001 --> 22:39.899
- We're done with this.
- Marty.

22:39.935 --> 22:43.903
We're moving on to a
multibillion-dollar deal

22:43.939 --> 22:47.641
that makes your herbal
tonics look like rat shit.

22:47.676 --> 22:48.642
- Okay.
- Okay, you know what,

22:48.677 --> 22:50.744
fuck these death-squad fascists.

22:50.779 --> 22:51.678
We're out of here,
all right?

22:51.713 --> 22:53.346
Hey, hey, hey.

22:53.382 --> 22:56.916
Hey, hey, hold it, hold up,
wait a minute, wait a minute.

22:56.952 --> 23:00.120
I'm sorry, let me get this
straight, because I don't think

23:00.155 --> 23:03.790
I'm quite believe I'm hearing
what I think it is I'm hearing,

23:03.825 --> 23:07.861
which is that you guys don't
think that you need each other.

23:11.533 --> 23:12.832
That's beautiful.

23:12.868 --> 23:13.867
Blockbuster?

23:13.902 --> 23:16.169
Who knows Blockbuster?

23:16.204 --> 23:17.537
Yeah, I remember it.

23:17.572 --> 23:19.139
Okay, well, you remember
when Blockbuster

23:19.174 --> 23:20.807
was hanging on by a thread?

23:20.842 --> 23:23.009
Because it refused
to adapt to the new reality?

23:23.045 --> 23:27.180
Guys, in every state, state
after state, day after day,

23:27.215 --> 23:28.581
legal weed is spreading
through the states.

23:28.617 --> 23:30.016
Spreading,
spread-spread-spread-spread.

23:30.052 --> 23:32.652
And in those states, even on
the sidewalks in those states,

23:32.688 --> 23:34.020
they are banning cigarettes.

23:34.056 --> 23:37.023
And those... those,
um... those, um...

23:37.059 --> 23:40.427
young cherubic kids that
you guys try and brainwash

23:40.462 --> 23:42.762
with your sexy ads and your
fucking... your health denials,

23:42.798 --> 23:44.864
they are hip to your shit, baby.

23:44.900 --> 23:46.199
Hip to your shit.

23:46.234 --> 23:48.101
That market share is
going bye-bye, okay?

23:48.136 --> 23:49.402
But, no, that's cool.

23:49.438 --> 23:51.538
You just hang in there
with your Blockbuster card

23:51.573 --> 23:53.873
and get in line
and rent your VHS tapes.

23:53.909 --> 23:55.608
"Uh, excuse me,
uh, might you have,

23:55.644 --> 23:59.346
uh, the behind-the-scenes
edition of <i>Blade Runner?"</i>

23:59.381 --> 24:00.914
Fucking idiots.

24:00.949 --> 24:02.582
No, no, no,
you-you...

24:02.617 --> 24:04.084
uh, I meant
you also

24:04.119 --> 24:06.386
are fucking idiots, okay?

24:06.421 --> 24:07.721
With your
psychedelic fantasy.

24:07.756 --> 24:09.389
You think that you can survive
without these guys?

24:09.424 --> 24:14.060
You're back there, holed up
in your maximum security utopia,

24:14.096 --> 24:16.129
huddled behind
your stacks of cash,

24:16.164 --> 24:18.131
'cause you can't open
a fucking bank account?

24:18.166 --> 24:21.267
Motherfucker, my teenager
got a bank account.

24:21.303 --> 24:23.069
Okay.

24:23.105 --> 24:24.738
You need these guys.

24:24.773 --> 24:26.539
They can give you a seat
at the grown-up table.

24:26.575 --> 24:28.541
With the bankers
and the lobbyists.

24:28.577 --> 24:29.743
Do you get it?

24:29.778 --> 24:32.746
Big Tobacco is coming
to the party

24:32.781 --> 24:34.080
with their big dicks out,

24:34.116 --> 24:36.116
and they're gonna fuck
all the hot chicks.

24:36.151 --> 24:38.385
Now, you want
to change the world?

24:38.420 --> 24:39.419
You better play along.

24:39.454 --> 24:40.754
You better try
and change that shit

24:40.789 --> 24:41.988
from the inside out.

24:42.023 --> 24:43.656
Guys, guys, guys, guys,
guys, guys, guys, guys.

24:43.692 --> 24:45.959
It's not about David
versus Goliath.

24:45.994 --> 24:48.261
No, David with Goliath.

24:48.296 --> 24:50.130
David holding hands
with Goliath.

24:50.165 --> 24:52.632
David giving Goliath
a-a reach-around.

24:55.837 --> 24:58.471
Oh, come on, am I spitting
wisdom right now?

24:58.507 --> 25:00.140
Yes.

25:00.175 --> 25:03.476
Do you guys need each
other right now? Yes.

25:03.512 --> 25:05.745
Am I high as fuck right now?

25:05.781 --> 25:07.080
Yes.

25:07.115 --> 25:12.085
But am I making 100% complete
total sense right now?

25:25.467 --> 25:27.767
Yes, yes, yes, I am.

25:27.803 --> 25:32.105
At the end of the day,
let's face it,

25:32.140 --> 25:35.341
it is better to merge
powers with an orc...

25:37.579 --> 25:38.645
...than to fight it.

25:41.149 --> 25:42.615
Ah-boom.

25:42.651 --> 25:43.616
Wait a minute.

25:43.652 --> 25:44.617
Ah-ba-boom.

25:48.857 --> 25:52.225
Okay, let's deal.

25:52.260 --> 25:54.060
You gonna open up your
wallets and make it rain?

25:58.200 --> 25:59.165
Fair enough.

26:00.335 --> 26:01.468
Say word.

26:05.507 --> 26:07.474
Did we really just do that?

26:07.509 --> 26:08.475
Mm-hmm.

26:10.512 --> 26:11.811
Don't get me wrong,
I'm flattered.

26:11.847 --> 26:14.147
I just wish Marty would
have run it by me

26:14.182 --> 26:15.815
before he used
the whole orc thing.

26:15.851 --> 26:18.485
But I get it, he was caught up
in the moment and carried away.

26:18.520 --> 26:20.487
Aw, you realize he was
fucked up out of his mind

26:20.522 --> 26:21.821
when he said it, right?

26:21.857 --> 26:23.823
You'll get it
eventually, Clyde.

26:23.859 --> 26:25.492
Hang in there.

26:26.862 --> 26:28.495
Not bad for someone
who ate enough pot

26:28.530 --> 26:30.163
to tranquilize
an elephant.

26:30.198 --> 26:32.332
What the fuck
just happened?

26:33.435 --> 26:35.635
What the fuck
just happened

26:35.670 --> 26:38.271
is you just scored
a touchdown

26:38.306 --> 26:41.074
with two seconds
left on the clock.

26:41.109 --> 26:42.408
Shit, I did?

26:42.444 --> 26:43.810
Mm-hmm.

26:43.845 --> 26:45.345
Ah.

26:46.982 --> 26:48.381
That's cool.

26:49.818 --> 26:51.384
Oh, Marty.

26:55.757 --> 26:59.025
I ate all the marijuanas.

26:59.060 --> 27:00.927
You sure did.
