-[gasps, pants]

01:10.028 --> 01:14.283
Wake up, wake up!
Don't want to sleep through your big day.

01:14.366 --> 01:16.868
-Big day?
-The big day you start with-- [gasps]

01:16.952 --> 01:18.954
Mom's special birthday pancakes!

01:19.037 --> 01:22.708
[Jim] He looks like he's screaming.
[Barbara] He's excited.

01:22.791 --> 01:24.876
I know, I know.
You always hate your birthday.

01:24.960 --> 01:29.172
But you're 16! This is a big one.
We should do something tonight.

01:29.256 --> 01:30.924
Oh, Mom, you know I don't want to--

01:31.008 --> 01:35.345
This isn't up for discussion.
No one should be alone on their birthday.

01:35.429 --> 01:39.725
When you've had your fill, I have
another surprise for you downstairs.

01:39.808 --> 01:41.601
[sighs]

01:44.354 --> 01:46.440
-[walkie-talkie beeping]
-[Toby] <i>Warhammer to Trollhunter. Copy?</i>

01:46.523 --> 01:49.151
-Copy. What is it, Tobes?
-<i>Look out your window!</i>

01:51.111 --> 01:55.365
I think a bird or something tore away
a piece of your drawing, Tobes.

01:55.449 --> 01:57.909
Ah, that was Aaarrrgghh.
He thought the cake was real.

01:57.993 --> 02:01.079
Or maybe he just likes the taste of paper.
Any word from Claire?

02:01.163 --> 02:03.498
No, she's not returning any of my texts.

02:03.582 --> 02:07.127
It's not like I destroyed her house
or anything. Oh, wait. It is.

02:07.210 --> 02:09.880
Dude, you didn't destroy her house.
Her fake baby brother did.

02:09.963 --> 02:12.132
Yeah, I'll be sure to mention that.

02:12.215 --> 02:14.676
<i>Have you thought about it?</i>
<i>Telling her, I mean?</i>

02:14.760 --> 02:16.595
Telling her her baby brother's
been swapped

02:16.678 --> 02:19.348
for a shape-shifting changeling troll
because of me?

02:19.431 --> 02:22.142
<i>-Is there a Hallmark card for that?</i>
-If there isn't, there should be.

02:22.225 --> 02:23.769
In the meantime, ignorance is bliss,

02:23.852 --> 02:27.147
and I've got a birthday gift for you
that Aaarrrgghh cannot eat.

02:27.230 --> 02:30.442
[Nana]
Toby-Pie! Why is this box empty?

02:30.525 --> 02:34.154
Ugh, Aaarrrgghh ate the kitty litter
again. Gotta go. Warhammer out.

02:34.237 --> 02:35.155
[sighs]

02:38.825 --> 02:39.868
Ew.

02:39.951 --> 02:41.203
[gasps]
Oh! Wait!

02:41.286 --> 02:44.081
Wait right there. Let me get
your present ready in the garage.

02:44.164 --> 02:45.165
The garage?

02:46.583 --> 02:50.253
I know you've wanted this for a while,
and now that you're the big one-six,

02:50.337 --> 02:51.755
-maybe it's time.
-[motor running]

02:51.838 --> 02:53.632
I think you'll get a lot
of mileage out of it.

02:53.715 --> 02:56.676
Did you seriously just get me a--?

02:56.760 --> 02:59.596
The Food Magic 3000!

02:59.679 --> 03:03.266
From those cooking shows you like.
It slices, it dices...

03:03.350 --> 03:05.310
And you hate it.

03:05.394 --> 03:10.857
-No, no, Mom, it's-- it's-- it's great!
-[gasps] Oh, no! You were expecting a...

03:10.941 --> 03:13.610
With the garage and the mileage...

03:13.693 --> 03:18.490
-It's fine. I also wanted one of these.
-We'll get a Vespa someday, Jim.

03:18.573 --> 03:21.535
Just... You know I hate the idea
of you on one of those things.

03:21.618 --> 03:23.745
The Food Magic is perfect, Mom, really.

03:23.829 --> 03:26.790
I can't wait
to cook you something with it.

03:26.873 --> 03:31.002
Jim! You gotta come quick!
There's an emergency in... the place.

03:31.086 --> 03:33.296
With the thing.
Not even an emergency, actually. It's--

03:33.380 --> 03:37.092
-Hey, is that a Food Magic?
-3000. I'll leave you boys to it.

03:37.175 --> 03:39.970
But, Jim, tonight... celebration!

03:42.013 --> 03:44.057
-Looking forward.
-[door closes]

03:44.641 --> 03:47.060
Seriously, we've got a Defcon One
situation in Trollmarket.

03:47.144 --> 03:49.479
-How do you know?
-I just do! Come on!

03:50.772 --> 03:53.316
-[suspenseful music playing]
-[growling]

03:58.238 --> 03:59.698
[troll]
Hurry! Run!

03:59.781 --> 04:02.159
[all yelling]

04:02.242 --> 04:03.785
It's too late, Master Jim.

04:03.869 --> 04:06.329
Aaarrrgghh has lost his mind!
Save yourself!

04:06.413 --> 04:08.290
I thought Aaarrrgghh was at your house!

04:08.373 --> 04:10.375
-[Aaarrrgghh roars]
-[screams]

04:12.669 --> 04:15.672
Oh, my gosh.
Was it the kitty litter? [grunts]

04:16.130 --> 04:17.548
[roars]

04:19.509 --> 04:20.510
What the--?

04:20.594 --> 04:22.929
-[grunting]
-[carnival music playing]

04:24.139 --> 04:27.309
-[party horn blows]
-Surprise!

04:27.392 --> 04:31.188
-Happy birthing day, Master Jim!
-What? [screams]

04:32.189 --> 04:33.398
Good actor.

04:33.482 --> 04:37.277
Tobias informed us
of your human surprise birthday customs.

04:37.360 --> 04:38.445
Are you not surprised?

04:38.528 --> 04:41.156
Uh... [chuckles]
That would be one word for it.

04:41.239 --> 04:46.161
-I was convincing.
-Sixteen years! A propitious milestone.

04:46.244 --> 04:50.540
Sixteen is when young trolls
master command of their bowels.

04:50.624 --> 04:52.292
[Vendel]
The Hero's Forge!

04:52.375 --> 04:58.840
Sacred proving grounds for Trollhunters
past, present, and future,

04:58.924 --> 05:01.927
reduced to mockery.

05:03.053 --> 05:04.721
Balloons.

05:05.514 --> 05:08.600
-Pop.
-You will remove them post-haste.

05:08.683 --> 05:12.604
I don't want anything
to delay the Trollhunter's training.

05:12.687 --> 05:17.609
-He didn't mention Claire's brother.
-In his defense, he's never met Enrique.

05:17.692 --> 05:19.528
I mean, didn't you tell him about Enrique?

05:19.611 --> 05:21.571
Mm, it pops.

05:21.655 --> 05:24.241
Vendel doesn't believe we have
a changeling problem, Master Jim.

05:24.324 --> 05:25.742
He certainly won't simply take my word

05:25.826 --> 05:28.286
that Claire's brother has
been replaced with one.

05:28.370 --> 05:29.704
But he's right about your training,

05:29.788 --> 05:31.623
and what better way
to celebrate your birthing day

05:31.706 --> 05:34.209
than to work on forestalling
your dying day.

05:34.292 --> 05:36.503
-[balloons popping]
-Mm...

05:36.586 --> 05:39.005
You will not always be
the quarry, Master Jim.

05:39.089 --> 05:41.341
The hunted must become the hunter!

05:41.424 --> 05:44.553
Speed and precision
is the goal of this drill, Master Jim.

05:44.636 --> 05:46.972
You must catch Aaarrrgghh
without reliance upon your amulet

05:47.055 --> 05:48.473
or the sword it manifests.

05:48.557 --> 05:52.269
If you are without your weapon,
the environment can be your weapon!

05:52.352 --> 05:54.479
Whoa!
[screams]

05:54.563 --> 05:56.982
A weapon you use, I mean.

06:00.735 --> 06:03.113
Master Jim does not appear to be himself.

06:03.196 --> 06:05.156
I expected the celebration
of his birthing day

06:05.240 --> 06:07.409
to add some spring to his step.

06:07.492 --> 06:09.202
Birthdays really aren't Jim's thing.

06:09.286 --> 06:10.662
[grunts]

06:10.745 --> 06:13.665
For creatures with such a short lifespan,
I would think they would be cherished.

06:13.748 --> 06:17.711
Uh, not for Jim. They always remind him
of the day when his dad disappeared.

06:17.794 --> 06:21.631
Interesting. I did not know
Jim's father was a magician.

06:21.715 --> 06:23.842
Mm, not "magic" disappeared.

06:23.925 --> 06:27.053
More like "walked out
'cause he's a deadbeat" disappeared.

06:27.137 --> 06:29.222
I'd just moved into the house
across the street,

06:29.306 --> 06:33.018
and Jim's dad got him this sweet bike kit
for his fifth birthday.

06:33.101 --> 06:36.688
And then, he just took off. The pieces
laid there in the garage for years.

06:36.771 --> 06:39.441
Last I heard,
the guy ran off with his girlfriend

06:39.524 --> 06:41.568
to be a ski bum in Vermont.

06:41.651 --> 06:45.447
What a horrible tragedy. Made even
more horrible that I had no idea.

06:45.530 --> 06:47.073
[Jim grunting]

06:47.157 --> 06:50.619
There you go, Master Jim!
That's how you...

06:50.702 --> 06:52.537
-[screams]
-[grunts]

06:52.621 --> 06:53.913
Gotcha.

06:55.040 --> 06:55.999
Uh...

06:57.876 --> 06:58.960
Mm.

06:59.669 --> 07:01.212
[birds tweeting]

07:17.520 --> 07:21.483
This is a scale, isn't it?
You've summoned a stalkling.

07:21.566 --> 07:23.652
To do what we should have done long ago.

07:23.735 --> 07:25.654
Stalklings are as dangerous
and unpredictable

07:25.737 --> 07:27.405
as they are uncontrollable.

07:27.489 --> 07:31.159
[loud snarling, wings flapping]

07:35.580 --> 07:36.581
[scoffs]

07:36.665 --> 07:38.959
We agreed that any attempt
on the boy's life

07:39.042 --> 07:40.794
would bring too much scrutiny.

07:40.877 --> 07:43.296
Which is why I summoned the stalkling.

07:43.380 --> 07:45.048
I'm sick of hiding in shadows

07:45.131 --> 07:49.928
while this fleshbag stumbles
closer and closer to my father's bridge.

07:50.011 --> 07:52.180
When she gets her prey alone,

07:52.263 --> 07:56.267
no one will ever see or hear
from the Trollhunter again.

07:56.351 --> 07:59.396
Lest they find his rotting bones.

07:59.479 --> 08:01.815
-[laughs]
-[snarling continues]

08:03.316 --> 08:05.735
[woman]
They open at 11:00! I'll see you inside.

08:05.819 --> 08:07.070
[woman 2]
Okay, cool!

08:07.153 --> 08:09.239
[snarling, wings flapping]

08:09.906 --> 08:11.282
Oh...

08:12.993 --> 08:15.245
All right, chief.
You ready for your birthday gift?

08:15.328 --> 08:17.080
Are we gonna sue someone?

08:17.163 --> 08:19.416
Nah, that's next year's gift.
Hey, give me your wallet.

08:19.499 --> 08:22.460
Maybe you don't know how
this whole gift thing's supposed to work.

08:22.544 --> 08:24.045
I've got it wired. Give me your wallet.

08:29.009 --> 08:31.886
[laughs]

08:34.972 --> 08:37.808
-Cool. We're ready.
-Not this again.

08:38.518 --> 08:39.352
Ha-ha!

08:40.020 --> 08:42.772
[humming]
Hmm.

08:42.856 --> 08:44.357
-Huh.
-Good day to you, sir!

08:44.441 --> 08:46.943
-Lovely weather we're having.
-You again?

08:47.027 --> 08:49.446
I told your friend
he can't do a test drive

08:49.529 --> 08:51.406
unless you have a learner's permit.

08:51.489 --> 08:52.490
Hot off the press.

08:56.036 --> 08:58.163
-Yeah, I also need an insur--
-An insurance card?

08:58.246 --> 09:00.165
Luckily, he's still on his mother's plan.

09:00.248 --> 09:02.500
His Social Security card.
Trust me, he's got good credit.

09:02.584 --> 09:05.003
And just for fun of it,
I also have his library card,

09:05.086 --> 09:08.173
along with signed testimonials
from his teachers and friends.

09:11.968 --> 09:13.094
Happy birthday.

09:13.178 --> 09:14.179
[chuckles]

09:14.763 --> 09:18.516
But he's still only 16.
Needs a signature from a parent.

09:18.600 --> 09:22.479
Would you accept the signature
of Mr. Lincoln and Mr. Washington?

09:23.813 --> 09:26.316
Ten minutes. And it better not
come back with a scratch.

09:28.651 --> 09:31.112
-Enjoy the ride, birthday boy.
-[chuckles]

09:50.924 --> 09:52.926
-[suspenseful music playing]
-[snarling]

09:53.009 --> 09:53.927
What the--?

09:54.010 --> 09:55.804
-[snarling]
-[grunts]

09:56.596 --> 09:58.807
What the heck! What was that?

10:00.892 --> 10:01.768
Steve?

10:05.605 --> 10:10.693
Nice wheels, understudy. I knew
you wanted to be me, but this is pathetic.

10:10.777 --> 10:12.987
This is really not
a good time right now, Steve.

10:13.071 --> 10:15.907
-Time for what?
-Whatever! This, you!

10:15.990 --> 10:19.369
Whoa! You calling me out?
You want to race?

10:19.452 --> 10:22.914
No! What I want
is to have nothing to do with you!

10:25.959 --> 10:27.919
You think you can take me, buttmunch?

10:28.002 --> 10:31.005
-Bring it!
-I don't want to bring anything!

10:32.924 --> 10:35.176
Oh, yeah, I'm totally gonna crush you!

10:39.305 --> 10:40.390
[laughing]

10:40.473 --> 10:41.975
-[car horn honking]
-[man] Hey, look out!

10:42.058 --> 10:43.726
-[screams] My wheels!
-[tires screeching]

10:44.310 --> 10:46.146
[screaming, groans]

10:47.230 --> 10:48.189
Uh...

10:48.273 --> 10:49.816
-[suspenseful music playing]
-[snarling]

10:49.899 --> 10:52.360
-[engine revving]
-[snarling continues]

10:55.488 --> 10:56.364
-[snarling]
-[screams]

11:03.037 --> 11:05.874
For the glory of Merlin,
Daylight is mine to command.

11:15.300 --> 11:17.719
[screeching]

11:19.053 --> 11:23.516
-[panting]
-[engine slowing down]

11:23.600 --> 11:24.517
[engine speeds up]

11:30.356 --> 11:33.276
Ah, Vendel! Just the troll
we've been looking for.

11:33.359 --> 11:35.570
Don't stop looking on my account.

11:35.653 --> 11:39.198
But it is imperative
that you look upon this.

11:40.617 --> 11:42.911
[groans]
Easy on the scruff!

11:43.953 --> 11:48.207
And what are you staring at, grandpa?
Have you never seen a changelin' before?

11:50.001 --> 11:52.837
So, this is Trollmarket.

11:52.921 --> 11:54.339
A changeling?

11:54.422 --> 11:58.009
You called me crazy,
but who's the mad troll now, huh?

11:58.092 --> 12:01.930
-Behold! I have proof!
-Put that thing away!

12:02.013 --> 12:05.183
What are you trying to do?
Incite a panic?

12:05.266 --> 12:08.728
'Ey! I only came here
'cause you promised me socks to eat.

12:08.811 --> 12:11.606
-And you'll get them.
-They better be argyle.

12:13.149 --> 12:15.068
[muffled]
And smelly.

12:15.151 --> 12:20.239
Do you finally believe me?
Changelings, therefore bridge.

12:20.323 --> 12:24.077
Bridge, therefore panic.
Have you heard nothing I've said?

12:24.160 --> 12:25.161
Hole.

12:26.371 --> 12:29.415
For once, you're right.
And the horror of it.

12:29.499 --> 12:32.752
Threat of Gunmar's exile
right over our heads,

12:32.835 --> 12:37.757
and all Trollmarket has to protect it
is your human Trollhunter child.

12:37.840 --> 12:40.093
You can trust the Trollhunter.

12:40.176 --> 12:44.097
In the face of the greatest danger,
he will stand steadfast and gallant.

12:44.180 --> 12:46.849
[screaming]

12:46.933 --> 12:49.394
Blinky! Blinky, you have to save me!

12:49.477 --> 12:53.856
A huge troll bird, like a jetliner
with claws, just tried to kill me!

12:53.940 --> 12:57.694
How could I not be put at ease
by such gallant bravery?

12:57.777 --> 12:59.195
Stalkling.

13:00.279 --> 13:02.615
-Very nasty.
-[blows raspberry]

13:02.699 --> 13:04.409
-Stalkling?
-Stalkling?

13:04.492 --> 13:07.495
It was flying in daylight.
How could it fly in daylight?

13:07.578 --> 13:10.707
Stalklings are one
of the only species of troll

13:10.790 --> 13:13.376
immune to the effects of sunlight.

13:13.459 --> 13:16.713
That looks not nearly as scary
as what attacked me.

13:16.796 --> 13:19.590
That's because those unlucky few
who are caught alone with it

13:19.674 --> 13:22.802
never live long enough to depict it.

13:22.885 --> 13:27.056
I'm curious. How is it
that you're not disemboweled?

13:27.140 --> 13:29.434
I don't know.
I hit him with my sword, I think.

13:29.517 --> 13:31.936
You struck a blow against a stalkling?

13:32.020 --> 13:34.439
-What gallant bravery!
-Well, it was more like luck than--

13:34.522 --> 13:38.860
Incredibly heroic
and brave and Trollhunter-ish.

13:38.943 --> 13:42.822
We shall see.
Once a stalkling marks its target, it...

13:43.990 --> 13:47.618
well, stalks it till death.

13:47.702 --> 13:49.996
-That doesn't sound good.
-Fear not, Master Jim.

13:50.079 --> 13:52.623
As long as you are not alone,
you will remain unharmed.

13:52.707 --> 13:55.710
You mean, I can't be alone
for the rest of my life?

13:55.793 --> 13:58.087
Is that a problem? You seem quite social.

13:58.671 --> 13:59.839
[phone vibrating]

13:59.922 --> 14:02.800
Ugh, this Vespa guy keeps calling
about paying for the damage.

14:02.884 --> 14:05.261
Ugh, the mirror. He noticed?

14:05.344 --> 14:08.389
You know the $328.32 you saved up?

14:08.473 --> 14:10.058
-He wants all of it.
-[sighs]

14:10.141 --> 14:12.518
I told him you became a monk
and renounced all earthly possessions,

14:12.602 --> 14:13.728
but he didn't believe me!

14:13.811 --> 14:16.439
So how you doing
with that whole death-bird thing?

14:16.522 --> 14:18.441
I'll live. I'll just never be alone again.

14:18.524 --> 14:20.651
Claire and plenty of other people
are at rehearsal,

14:20.735 --> 14:22.445
I can call my mom to pick me up after,

14:22.528 --> 14:23.863
and you'll ride with me
to school tomorrow.

14:23.946 --> 14:26.240
Okay, and then what? What happens
if you have to go to the bathroom?

14:26.324 --> 14:28.284
Do you have to take a chaperone?
Not it, by the way.

14:28.368 --> 14:32.288
Eventually, the stalkling has
to lose interest, right?

14:32.372 --> 14:34.415
Hide out amongst people
until the troll bird gets bored.

14:34.499 --> 14:35.958
Heroic plan, Jimbo.

14:36.042 --> 14:37.502
-There you are!
-Claire!

14:37.585 --> 14:41.714
I... I thought you said you weren't
ever gonna speak to me again.

14:41.798 --> 14:44.133
Actually, I said I hoped
I'd never see you again.

14:44.217 --> 14:47.136
Well, looks like you've got
a chaperone. <i>Adios.</i>

14:47.220 --> 14:49.472
I'll let you know
when I gotta go to the bathroom.

14:49.555 --> 14:52.475
I was upset. You and Toby
totally trashed my house.

14:52.558 --> 14:54.811
My parents blamed me
for leaving Enrique with you.

14:54.894 --> 14:57.397
I would've gotten in less trouble
if you'd let him get kidnapped.

14:57.480 --> 15:02.610
Really? I-I mean... No, you're right.
You're right. You're totally right.

15:02.693 --> 15:07.073
Toby and I should never have
used your house for, um... for a rave.

15:07.156 --> 15:11.494
-I'm sorry, again.
-The thing is, I asked around.

15:11.577 --> 15:13.871
I couldn't find a single person
who was there.

15:13.955 --> 15:16.040
Be straight with me.
What really happened?

15:17.291 --> 15:18.209
[door opens]

15:18.292 --> 15:21.087
There you are, Jim! So glad you're here!

15:21.170 --> 15:25.758
I hope the two of you are ready
to recreate the tragedy of true love.

15:25.842 --> 15:28.803
-Places in five!
-What's she talking about?

15:28.886 --> 15:31.389
Steve totaled his Vespa.
He's got a concussion.

15:31.472 --> 15:33.641
And Ms. Janeth says
he can't be Romeo anymore.

15:33.724 --> 15:36.060
We can't do <i>Romeo and Juliet</i>
without a Romeo, Jim.

15:36.144 --> 15:38.729
Uh, okay, but I'm still confused.

15:38.813 --> 15:41.441
You're the understudy
for Romeo, remember?

15:41.524 --> 15:44.110
I need you to come back.
I'm willing to beg.

15:44.193 --> 15:47.238
No, sure. Let me just see
if I can get my mom to pick me up.

15:47.321 --> 15:48.531
[clears throat]

15:49.323 --> 15:50.491
"Forgive me!

15:51.617 --> 15:53.870
Forgive me!"

15:55.288 --> 15:58.249
[clears throat]
"Forgive me, cousin."

15:58.332 --> 16:00.209
Ah, right. Sorry. Got it.

16:00.293 --> 16:02.003
"Forgive me, cousin.

16:02.086 --> 16:06.591
Ah, dear Juliet,
why art thou yet so fair?"

16:07.341 --> 16:08.926
[growling]

16:09.886 --> 16:12.847
[Janeth]
Great rehearsal. Memorize, memorize.

16:12.930 --> 16:15.266
Opening night's
just around the corner, thespians.

16:15.349 --> 16:16.726
-[snarling]
-What was that?

16:16.809 --> 16:19.729
Uh, maybe I can walk you home?

16:19.812 --> 16:22.356
I think my parents would kill you
if they saw you with me.

16:22.440 --> 16:24.192
And anyway, they're picking me up.

16:24.275 --> 16:27.445
Oh, no, no, no.
My mom's picking me up, too. I just...

16:27.528 --> 16:30.364
Maybe we could keep each other company.

16:30.448 --> 16:31.616
Okay.

16:31.699 --> 16:32.617
-[growling]
-[gasps]

16:32.700 --> 16:35.786
-[wind blowing]
-[Claire] Uh...

16:35.870 --> 16:37.955
Are you all right?
[clears throat]

16:38.039 --> 16:42.126
Uh, yeah, just, um...
I'm worried about the weather.

16:42.210 --> 16:43.377
[car horn honking]

16:46.339 --> 16:49.175
Thanks again for stepping up today.
You really saved the play.

16:50.343 --> 16:53.638
-Claire, wait! Uh...
-[ringtone playing]

16:53.721 --> 16:56.641
[Barbara] <i>Hey, it's me. I have</i>
<i>to stay a little late at the clinic.</i>

16:56.724 --> 16:58.267
-What?
-[thunder rumbling]

16:58.351 --> 17:01.562
I know, I know.
We'll still celebrate, I promise.

17:01.646 --> 17:04.523
But some knucklehead crashed his Vespa,
and I have to work up the x-rays.

17:04.607 --> 17:06.608
<i>You have your bike.</i>
<i>Can you find your way home by yourself?</i>

17:08.361 --> 17:09.487
By myself?

17:10.905 --> 17:12.240
Wait, wait!

17:13.950 --> 17:17.662
Hi, Mr. and Mrs. Nuñez!
I was hoping maybe I could catch a ride?

17:17.744 --> 17:19.329
[man on radio]
<i>Power outages could be occurring.</i>

17:19.413 --> 17:22.625
<i>We're also experiencing</i>
<i>flash flood warnings in Arcadia...</i>

17:22.708 --> 17:23.709
Wait, wait, wait!

17:25.962 --> 17:28.381
-But it's my birthday!
-[man on radio] <i>Have a great night!</i>

17:30.883 --> 17:35.721
Come on, Tobes.
Pick up. Please, pick up!

17:35.805 --> 17:38.808
-[grunting]
-Come on, come on, come on! [laughs]

17:38.891 --> 17:41.727
Shrimp roll, here I come!
No, no, no!

17:42.687 --> 17:45.398
<i>You've reached the Toby phone!</i>

17:45.481 --> 17:47.900
Ooh, cream cheese!
Get the Philadelphia roll! Yeah!

17:47.984 --> 17:49.735
-[phone vibrating]
-[Aaarrrgghh] Boom! Double points.

17:49.819 --> 17:51.320

18:16.804 --> 18:18.222
Now what?

18:19.599 --> 18:20.641
Hey, you!

18:21.976 --> 18:24.103
-Spicy tuna! Spicy tuna!
-Aw...

18:24.186 --> 18:27.815
-Oh, man! Stupid storm.
-[phone vibrating]

18:27.898 --> 18:29.567

18:29.650 --> 18:32.320

18:32.403 --> 18:33.654
[gasps]
We gotta go!

18:34.530 --> 18:37.325
[to himself] Sixteenth birthday,
but do I get a Vespa? No.

18:37.408 --> 18:40.244
I get a food processor
and a killer flying troll!

This way!

19:00.306 --> 19:03.059
For the glory of Merlin,
Daylight is mine to command,

19:03.142 --> 19:06.145
because I really, really
don't want to die!

-Yeah, Aaarrrgghh!

20:37.319 --> 20:38.362
[both gasp]

20:43.534 --> 20:46.203
This is why I hate birthdays.

20:47.121 --> 20:48.998
This better not be another surprise

20:49.081 --> 20:51.459
because I really don't think
I can handle any more.

20:51.542 --> 20:53.502
No, no. If my calculations are correct,

20:53.586 --> 20:56.547
there's only a few more minutes left
to your birthing day.

20:56.630 --> 20:58.382
Time for one more present.

20:59.258 --> 21:01.385
I know it doesn't look like much...

21:01.469 --> 21:05.264
Wait. That's a 150 G.S.

21:05.347 --> 21:08.684
Four-speed gear box,
classic long saddle...

21:08.768 --> 21:11.228
original handlebar headlamp unit!

21:11.312 --> 21:14.231
These are the pieces of a 1955 Vespa!

21:14.315 --> 21:15.191
[chuckles]

21:15.274 --> 21:19.403
I thought perhaps one day
we could build it together.

21:19.487 --> 21:21.405
After your training, of course.

21:21.489 --> 21:25.284
Thank you. Thank you!
This is the best gift I've ever gotten!

21:25.367 --> 21:27.411
[chuckles, grunts]

21:27.495 --> 21:30.456
-Oh, well.
-I knew we'd turn it around.

21:30.539 --> 21:32.458
When is your birthing day?

21:32.541 --> 21:35.211
[scoffs]
Like I'd ever tell you, wingman.

-[faint chatter on PA system.
-And welcome to America. Next.

21:45.513 --> 21:49.225
-Business or pleasure?
-Perhaps a bit of both?

Boy. Anything to declare?
