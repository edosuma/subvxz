WEBVTT

00:01.167 --> 00:02.828
Is everything all right?

00:02.902 --> 00:03.698
Yeah.

00:03.770 --> 00:05.499
<i>Previously on "Sports Night"...</i>

00:05.572 --> 00:07.370
No, I meant with you
and Gordon.

00:07.440 --> 00:09.738
You need to let the show go
once in a while.

00:09.809 --> 00:11.004
Yes, I do.

00:11.077 --> 00:12.841
-- What shirt are you missing? Your
favorite. -- My white J. Press.

00:12.912 --> 00:15.438
Maybe it got mixed up
with someone else's laundry.

00:15.515 --> 00:17.449
-- How'd the shirt get left behind?
-- I spilled wine.

00:17.517 --> 00:19.849
-- The 2:00 A.M. is my show.
-- And you do a good job.

00:19.919 --> 00:23.116
Natalie tells me that Rebecca really
liked me and that I should call her.

00:23.189 --> 00:24.520
That's the second time
you called me Danny.

00:24.591 --> 00:26.855
-- Do you like it?
-- Yeah.

00:26.926 --> 00:28.894
<i>Listen,
I better get in action.</i>

00:28.962 --> 00:30.293
Do you think Casey's
been seeing Sally?

00:30.363 --> 00:32.923
-- What's on your mind, Casey? --
You're wearing my shirt, Gordon.

00:37.871 --> 00:39.771
<i>Will: Studio
this is Master Control.</i>

00:39.839 --> 00:42.103
<i>You're up on router 9 tonight.
Have a good show.</i>

00:42.175 --> 00:44.872
<i>Dave: Standby audio,
standby VTR.</i>

00:44.944 --> 00:48.073
-- Kim, I'm still looking for two back
in the teens. -- We're getting there.

00:48.148 --> 00:50.412
<i>Man: Can I hear a roll call
from the field, please?</i>

00:50.483 --> 00:51.882
-- This guy won't die.
-- He won't.

00:51.951 --> 00:53.441
-- He will not die.
-- He just won't.

00:53.520 --> 00:55.352
-- Can you believe this?
-- The man won't die.

00:55.422 --> 00:57.948
<i>Jeremy: Dear Louise, here's
what's going on right now.</i>

00:58.024 --> 01:01.050
<i>CSC is carrying
the Continental Challenge live.</i>

01:01.127 --> 01:02.891
<i>Sampras is playing
a first-round match</i>

01:02.962 --> 01:04.726
<i>against a guy named
Alberto Fedrigotti,</i>

01:04.798 --> 01:07.165
<i>who's ranked 178th
in the world tennis standings</i>

01:07.233 --> 01:09.895
<i>and who Sampras should have
easily finished off by now.</i>

01:09.969 --> 01:11.528
I gotta be perfectly honest
with you,

01:11.604 --> 01:12.730
I've never heard of this guy.

01:12.806 --> 01:14.137
His name's Alberto Fedrigotti.

01:14.207 --> 01:15.538
I've never seen him play.

01:15.608 --> 01:17.633
<i>Sampras won the first two sets
in a walk</i>

01:17.710 --> 01:19.337
<i>and was up 4-love in the third.</i>

01:19.412 --> 01:21.904
<i>The crowd filed out to the
parking lot a half-hour ago.</i>

01:21.981 --> 01:23.380
<i>The match was over.</i>

01:23.450 --> 01:26.283
<i>Except nobody told
Alberto Fedrigotti.</i>

01:26.352 --> 01:27.285
[AH groan]

01:27.353 --> 01:28.514
This guy won't die!

01:28.588 --> 01:29.851
He really won't.

01:29.923 --> 01:31.584
<i>Jeremy: He battled back
and was up a break,</i>

01:31.658 --> 01:34.286
<i>and, to Sampras' astonishment,
was serving for the set.</i>

01:34.360 --> 01:36.522
<i>We were still assuming Sampras
would break his serve</i>

01:36.596 --> 01:38.428
<i>and we'd be able to get
the show underway.</i>

01:38.498 --> 01:41.468
<i>Will: Two minutes to VTR.
Chris: Standby 2, 2A, and 3.</i>

01:41.534 --> 01:43.400
Preview animation.
Standby F/X-3.

01:43.470 --> 01:44.494
Dana, I'm at ready-1.

01:44.571 --> 01:46.539
Hang on. We may have to hold
for a few minutes.

01:46.606 --> 01:49.303
<i>And the thing is, we're supposed
to go on the air at 11:00,</i>

01:49.375 --> 01:51.707
<i>and if Fedrigotti holds his
serve and forces a new set,</i>

01:51.778 --> 01:53.940
<i>that means we've got to hold
for another half-hour</i>

01:54.013 --> 01:55.777
<i>while Sampras
makes this guy say uncle,</i>

01:55.849 --> 01:57.681
<i>and nobody here likes to hold.</i>

01:57.750 --> 02:00.811
<i>In the studio, Dan and Casey
were waiting for the cue</i> --

02:00.887 --> 02:02.651
<i>"60 seconds to VTR."</i>

02:02.722 --> 02:05.589
<i>Dan was doing what he always does
when it's two minutes to air</i> --

02:05.658 --> 02:06.989
<i>he was annoying Casey.</i>

02:07.060 --> 02:09.256
-- I don't think you should be this way.
-- I'm being this way.

02:09.329 --> 02:11.457
-- Yeah, but I don't think you should
be this way. -- I am this way.

02:11.531 --> 02:12.999
-- Seriously, all right?
-- Danny.

02:13.066 --> 02:15.125
-- Seriously. -- No. No seriously.
We're doing the show.

02:15.201 --> 02:17.363
-- This has something to do with
the shirt, doesn't it? -- Danny.

02:17.437 --> 02:19.030
Does it have something to do
with the shirt?

02:19.105 --> 02:20.869
-- You're wired.
-- No, I'm not.

02:20.940 --> 02:22.704
-- You're wired.
-- I'm perfectly calm.

02:22.775 --> 02:25.176
You're wired.
I don't want to talk about it.

02:25.245 --> 02:28.579
<i>In the control room, Dana was resigned
to going up three or four minutes late</i>

02:28.648 --> 02:30.377
<i>to allow Sampras
to close out the match,</i>

02:30.450 --> 02:32.418
<i>but she just wasn't
emotionally prepared</i>

02:32.485 --> 02:34.476
<i>for the thing to get thrown
to a fourth set.</i>

02:34.554 --> 02:36.852
Can you believe this guy is
doing this to me?

02:36.923 --> 02:38.482
I don't think it's personal,
Dana.

02:38.558 --> 02:39.855
Oh, it is personal, Jeremy.

02:39.926 --> 02:41.917
Don't worry. My Pete's
gonna take care of him.

02:41.995 --> 02:43.087
Your Pete?

02:43.163 --> 02:44.528
Pete Sampras
has a little crush on me.

02:44.597 --> 02:46.361
-- Really? In Natalie
world or -- -- Yeah.

02:46.432 --> 02:48.730
-- In Natalie world. He sends
me flowers a lot. -- Ah.

02:48.801 --> 02:50.735
One time he came over
and cooked me dinner.

02:50.803 --> 02:52.999
He was wearing the most
beautiful charcoal gray --

02:53.072 --> 02:54.005
Hang on.

02:54.073 --> 02:56.735
-- <i>[All groan]</i> -- <i>I didn't see
the forehand passing shot</i>

02:56.809 --> 02:59.540
<i>that Fedrigotti made
to force the new set.</i>

02:59.612 --> 03:00.875
<i>Neither did Sampras.</i>

03:00.947 --> 03:02.881
This guy won't die.

03:02.949 --> 03:05.714
Dan: Do you want to talk
about it now?

03:05.785 --> 03:06.877
Casey: No.

03:06.953 --> 03:09.285
I mean,
now that I'm not wired.

03:09.355 --> 03:10.845
-- We gotta hold.
-- No.

03:10.924 --> 03:11.982
-- Yes.
-- Why?

03:12.058 --> 03:13.389
Just to bother you.

03:13.459 --> 03:17.293
-- Why are we holding? -- 'Cause some
guy named Fettucine Alfredo just --

03:17.363 --> 03:18.694
Jeremy, what's his name?

03:18.765 --> 03:20.096
Alberto Fed rigotti.

03:20.166 --> 03:23.136
Alberto Fedrigotti just took
Sampras to a fourth set.

03:23.203 --> 03:24.466
Why would he do this to me?

03:24.537 --> 03:26.631
He's not doing it to you
personally, Casey.

03:26.706 --> 03:28.299
He's doing it to <i>me</i>
personally.

03:28.374 --> 03:31.139
All right, Dave. I guess
take us down from ready-1.

03:31.211 --> 03:33.737
Kim, Elliott, why don't you
talk to the field?

03:33.813 --> 03:35.474
Let's stay on top
of the late scores.

03:35.548 --> 03:38.074
And don't anybody go too far.

03:38.151 --> 03:40.017
Dave, you should take us down
from ready-1.

03:40.086 --> 03:41.850
Kim, Elliott, you should
get on the phone

03:41.921 --> 03:43.355
and call our people
in the field

03:43.423 --> 03:44.948
and back them up
about 45 minutes.

03:45.024 --> 03:47.015
Obviously, we'll keep
updating the late scores.

03:47.093 --> 03:48.720
And please, don't anybody
go too far.

03:48.795 --> 03:50.354
Dana, we just did this.

03:50.430 --> 03:51.591
Ah.

03:56.369 --> 03:57.803
[Sighs]

03:57.870 --> 04:00.134
No, this is good...

04:00.206 --> 04:02.231
'cause now we can talk
about it.

04:07.747 --> 04:09.340
Want to get a doughnut?

04:09.415 --> 04:12.680
-- I was gonna stay and write
a letter to Louise. -- Ah.

04:12.752 --> 04:14.220
Hey, uh, Mildred.
It's Dana.

04:14.287 --> 04:15.277
Is he there?

04:16.623 --> 04:18.819
Do you want to go someplace
and make out?

04:19.959 --> 04:21.017
That sounds good,

04:21.094 --> 04:23.620
but I really want to write
this letter to my sister.

04:23.696 --> 04:25.164
Okay.

04:25.231 --> 04:29.600
It's gonna be 20 minutes --
half-hour tops, I promise.

04:29.669 --> 04:32.934
Come by here at 12:30
and pick me up.

04:33.006 --> 04:36.374
We're gonna have a great time
tonight.

04:36.442 --> 04:38.740
Okay, I'll see you then.

04:42.649 --> 04:43.241
Hi.

04:43.316 --> 04:44.283
Hi.

04:45.518 --> 04:47.646
Are, uh, Kim and Elliott --

04:47.720 --> 04:48.653
Yeah.

04:48.721 --> 04:50.587
Good.

04:50.657 --> 04:52.421
Oh, hey, did someone
tell Isaac --

04:52.492 --> 04:54.426
-- Yeah.
-- Good.

04:54.494 --> 04:55.427
Excellent.

04:55.495 --> 04:56.428
Cool.

04:56.496 --> 04:57.429
Natalie.

04:57.497 --> 04:58.430
Yeah.

04:58.498 --> 05:01.229
I have nothing to do.

05:01.301 --> 05:03.565
-- [ Sighs] -- Do you want to
go with me to get a doughnut?

05:03.636 --> 05:05.695
Mmm, nah.

05:05.772 --> 05:07.365
Do you want to go someplace
and make out?

05:07.440 --> 05:09.306
No.

05:09.375 --> 05:11.366
-- I'm gonna get a doughnut.
-- Okay.

05:14.147 --> 05:15.581
What are you doing?

05:15.648 --> 05:16.911
I'm writing a letter.

05:16.983 --> 05:17.973
<i>To your sister?</i>

05:18.051 --> 05:18.984
To my sister.

05:19.052 --> 05:20.816
That's nice.

05:22.822 --> 05:24.221
Louise is a nice name.

05:24.290 --> 05:26.418
She's named
for our grandmother.

05:26.492 --> 05:27.425
Yeah?

05:27.493 --> 05:28.426
Yep.

05:28.494 --> 05:31.020
My grandmother's name
was Alice...

05:31.097 --> 05:32.531
on my mother's side.

05:32.598 --> 05:36.330
My father's,
it was Penelope...

05:36.402 --> 05:39.133
which is a name
you don't hear much anymore.

05:41.074 --> 05:43.270
-- Penelope was --
-- You know what's hard?

05:43.343 --> 05:44.868
Writing here
and talking there.

05:44.944 --> 05:47.106
I have unscheduled time
on my hands.

05:47.180 --> 05:49.080
And I know how difficult
that must be for you,

05:49.148 --> 05:51.708
but...l want to write
this letter.

05:51.784 --> 05:53.274
Okay.

05:54.487 --> 05:56.353
Want to play
garbage-can basketball?

05:56.422 --> 05:57.912
-- Dana! -- A little
garbage-can basketball?

05:57.990 --> 05:59.515
No.

05:59.592 --> 06:01.287
That's fine.

06:01.361 --> 06:04.262
<i>Jeremy: Anyway, Michael said
when he saw you</i>

06:04.330 --> 06:07.129
<i>you were upset about the divorce
and talking about leaving school.</i>

06:07.200 --> 06:09.134
<i>For the moment,
I'm not going to lecture you.</i>

06:09.202 --> 06:12.365
<i>I know you're concerned about Mom and
Dad, and we're on this hold right now,</i>

06:12.438 --> 06:16.636
<i>so my intention is simply to take your mind
off things with some tales of "Sports Night."</i>

06:16.709 --> 06:19.906
<i>I'm gonna have to get up for a second, though,
'cause I know what's about to come from Dana.</i>

06:19.979 --> 06:21.572
Is it 'cause you're chicken?

06:21.647 --> 06:23.046
<i>Be right back.</i>

06:33.092 --> 06:34.491
<i>Jeremy: I'm back.</i>

06:34.560 --> 06:36.688
<i>I should tell you, in the
interest of full disclosure,</i>

06:36.763 --> 06:39.494
<i>that Dana's a surprisingly good
garbage-can basketball player.</i>

06:39.565 --> 06:43.126
<i>I'm likely to have a random visitor
or two whiie I write this,</i>

06:43.202 --> 06:44.966
<i>but for the most part,
everyone here has gone</i>

06:45.037 --> 06:46.630
<i>to some neutral corner
for a little bit.</i>

06:48.408 --> 06:49.000
<i>Casey...</i>

06:49.075 --> 06:50.565
I'll tell you what
the problem is here.

06:50.643 --> 06:51.940
No provolone cheese?

06:52.011 --> 06:53.240
No provolone.

06:53.312 --> 06:54.973
You're saying you don't
want to talk about it?

06:55.047 --> 06:58.017
I'm saying I'd like just once
for there to be provolone.

06:58.084 --> 06:59.347
Is this one of those times

06:59.419 --> 07:00.215
when you say you don't
want to talk about it

07:00.286 --> 07:01.151
but you really do?

07:01.220 --> 07:02.745
No, but it's shaping up to be

07:02.822 --> 07:04.688
one of those times when I say
I don't want to talk about it

07:04.757 --> 07:06.623
but we end up talking
about it anyway.

07:06.692 --> 07:09.423
<i>You'll be happy to know that Dan
finally got a date with Rebecca.</i>

07:09.495 --> 07:11.190
<i>They've been out to dinner
twice,</i>

07:11.264 --> 07:15.030
<i>but because of a kind of emotionally abusive
marriage that Rebecca just got out of,</i>

07:15.101 --> 07:17.763
<i>she's been very cautious
with Dan.</i>

07:19.739 --> 07:20.797
Hey, Casey.
Hey, Dan.

07:20.873 --> 07:22.466
-- Hey, look at this.
-- Hi.

07:22.542 --> 07:24.169
-- You're here.
-- <i>I know.</i>

07:24.243 --> 07:26.268
We're actually on a hold. The
tennis coverage is running over.

07:26.345 --> 07:27.437
I know.

07:27.513 --> 07:28.776
You look nice.

07:28.848 --> 07:30.145
Thanks.

07:30.216 --> 07:31.342
Am I in trouble?

07:31.417 --> 07:32.543
Yes.

07:32.618 --> 07:35.019
-- I'll leave. -- Casey, do
you remember the reason why

07:35.087 --> 07:37.021
Dan came down to my office
in the first place?

07:37.089 --> 07:39.114
Uh, please, oh, please,
don't drag me into this.

07:39.192 --> 07:41.183
It was to tell me
that he couldn't ask me out

07:41.260 --> 07:44.161
because he'd started seeing a woman
named Elaine. Am I right, Casey?

07:44.230 --> 07:46.164
You see, I'm sitting here
with no provolone.

07:46.232 --> 07:48.894
Then, when he became helplessly in love
with me -- as men are prone to do --

07:48.968 --> 07:51.733
<i>he said he'd tell Elaine that they
couldn't see each other anymore.</i>

07:51.804 --> 07:52.703
-- <i>Rebecca</i> --
-- <i>Oh, by the way,</i>

07:52.772 --> 07:55.002
I took a couple of phone messages
while I was sitting here.

07:55.074 --> 07:56.200
Did my father call,
by any chance?

07:56.275 --> 07:57.401
Elaine called.

07:57.477 --> 07:59.411
Look at this. Hey, Elaine
called for you, Casey.

07:59.479 --> 08:00.708
Mmm.

08:00.780 --> 08:02.179
You're pitiful.

08:02.248 --> 08:04.342
There hasn't been
the kind of time necessary --

08:04.417 --> 08:06.749
You've got a little time on your
hands right now, doesn't he, Casey?

08:06.819 --> 08:08.253
<i>This is big-time television.</i>

08:08.321 --> 08:10.517
The guy puts out Swiss cheese
and nothing else.

08:10.590 --> 08:12.718
Here's the thing.
I would do it right now.

08:12.792 --> 08:14.920
I would do it
right this second.

08:14.994 --> 08:17.224
But I'm in sort of
a preshow mode.

08:17.296 --> 08:20.027
That's a very delicate energy,
and it can't be tampered with.

08:20.099 --> 08:22.431
All anyone here is thinking
about is the broadcast.

08:22.502 --> 08:25.528
-- Guys, a little garbage-can basketball?
-- Dan's in preshow mode.

08:25.605 --> 08:26.663
[Laughs]

08:26.739 --> 08:28.366
That's a good one.

08:28.441 --> 08:30.341
[Sighs]

08:30.409 --> 08:32.070
See, the thing about
the preshow mode is that --

08:32.144 --> 08:33.509
I'll see you
after the show.

08:33.578 --> 08:34.671
You bet.

08:35.780 --> 08:36.679
Kim!

08:36.749 --> 08:39.342
Here's what's interesting
about sports.

08:39.418 --> 08:42.615
<i>None of that would've happened if tennis boy
here had gotten beat when he was supposed to.</i>

08:43.623 --> 08:46.217
-- Yeah? -- Next time I step out of my
office and ask you to catch my phone calls,

08:46.292 --> 08:48.260
can you do me a favor and,
you know, do it?

08:48.327 --> 08:50.352
Still can't get the green light
from Rebecca?

08:50.429 --> 08:51.453
Shut up.

08:54.534 --> 08:55.695
<i>Dave...</i>

08:55.768 --> 08:56.792
You've got

08:56.869 --> 08:58.303
Kim, you've got “H-O.“

08:58.404 --> 09:00.429
Will,
you've got "H-O-R-S,"

09:00.473 --> 09:01.634
which is sad.

09:01.707 --> 09:03.539
I'm winning,
which is inevitable.

09:03.609 --> 09:05.600
Natalie, your shot.

09:05.678 --> 09:08.943
From Elliott's desk, off the conference
room glass, into the garbage can.

09:09.015 --> 09:11.541
<i>Jeremy: Meanwhile,
the Sampras/Fedrtgottt match</i>

09:11.617 --> 09:13.051
<i>is deep in the fourth set.</i>

09:13.119 --> 09:16.054
<i>I'm starting to see signs that
we'll be going on the air soon.</i>

09:16.122 --> 09:19.990
<i>Everyone's assuming that Sampras will
finish off this guy in just a few minutes.</i>

09:20.059 --> 09:21.652
<i>But there's a look
on Sampras' face now</i>

09:21.727 --> 09:24.458
<i>that you have to be around
sports long enough to recognize.</i>

09:24.530 --> 09:26.430
<i>He's the greatest player
in the world,</i>

09:26.499 --> 09:29.833
<i>and he's been on the court
with this guy way too long.</i>

09:29.902 --> 09:32.394
-- <i>What's</i> going <i>on?</i>
-- <i>He just broke his serve.</i>

09:32.471 --> 09:34.337
Ah. It's about time.
I'll go tell everybody.

09:34.407 --> 09:35.169
-- Elliott.
-- Yeah.

09:35.241 --> 09:37.801
Fedrigotti just broke
Sampras' serve.

09:37.877 --> 09:39.868
[Keyboard keys clicking,
telephone ringing]

09:44.984 --> 09:47.851
<i>Dana: AH right, from the plant,
ricochet off Will's head</i> --

09:47.920 --> 09:49.649
Guys, we got a ballgame.

09:49.722 --> 09:50.689
What?

09:50.756 --> 09:54.488
He just broke Sampras' serve.
It's 4-2 in the fourth.

09:56.829 --> 09:59.127
Doesn't this guy understand
that I'm in television?

09:59.198 --> 10:01.929
<i>This match, which was supposed
to be a walk,</i>

10:02.001 --> 10:03.765
<i>was heading
into its fourth hour.</i>

10:03.836 --> 10:05.565
<i>And that was a bad break
for Dana,</i>

10:05.638 --> 10:08.130
<i>'cause tonight's the night that
Dana's meeting Gordon's friends.</i>

10:08.207 --> 10:09.140
He broke serve?

10:09.208 --> 10:10.369
Yeah.

10:14.947 --> 10:17.211
<i>Dana and Gordon have been
on thin ice lately,</i>

10:17.283 --> 10:19.149
<i>due mostly to Gordon's feeling</i>

10:19.218 --> 10:23.314
<i>that Dana's more involved with the show than
with him and that Dana's not making an effort.</i>

10:23.389 --> 10:27.189
<i>She knew that canceling their date
tonight would infuriate Gordon.</i>

10:29.195 --> 10:30.856
<i>She tried catching him
at the office</i>

10:30.930 --> 10:34.628
<i>before he left to come over, but
he'd already left to come over.</i>

10:37.103 --> 10:40.971
Well...we've got ourselves
a ballgame.

10:48.147 --> 10:50.081
I really don't believe it.

10:50.149 --> 10:52.345
He just absolutely
will not die.

10:52.418 --> 10:54.113
Elliott, call the field.

10:54.186 --> 10:56.587
Back them up
another 45 minutes.

10:56.656 --> 10:58.090
This man
is ruining my night.

10:58.157 --> 10:59.249
You're up $50.

10:59.325 --> 11:00.554
I have plans tonight.

11:00.626 --> 11:03.789
I have plans tonight with people
who aren't any of you.

11:03.863 --> 11:04.955
He just won't die.

11:06.332 --> 11:07.390
He'll understand.

11:07.466 --> 11:08.399
No.

11:08.467 --> 11:09.559
He will.

11:09.635 --> 11:11.831
I'm meeting his friends.
They're at the restaurant.

11:11.904 --> 11:13.372
He's coming here
to pick me up.

11:13.439 --> 11:15.430
This is just the kind of thing
that he was --

11:15.508 --> 11:17.033
Hey.

11:17.109 --> 11:18.372
There's another option.

11:18.444 --> 11:19.377
What?

11:19.445 --> 11:20.810
Give the show to Sally.

11:20.880 --> 11:22.507
-- Natalie --
-- It's after midnight.

11:22.581 --> 11:24.447
-- Dana, if you want --
-- No way. No way.

11:24.517 --> 11:26.508
<i>Jeremy: As if things
weren't bad enough,</i>

11:26.585 --> 11:28.383
<i>Dana has the clock
to contend with.</i>

11:28.454 --> 11:30.354
<i>It's after midnight
right now,</i>

11:30.423 --> 11:33.017
<i>and if the fifth set of the
Sampras/Fedrtgottt match goes long,</i>

11:33.092 --> 11:34.992
<i>it will be past 1:00.</i>

11:35.061 --> 11:38.292
<i>At some point, a decision will be made
whether to g0 on with the late broadcast</i>

11:38.364 --> 11:41.629
<i>or to hand off the show and let the 2:00
A.M. pick up the scores and highlights,</i>

11:41.701 --> 11:43.726
<i>and handing off the show
means Sally.</i>

11:43.803 --> 11:44.668
You've done it before.

11:44.737 --> 11:46.831
As a last resort,
as a worst-case scenario.

11:46.906 --> 11:47.998
-- Yes.
-- Mm-hmm.

11:48.074 --> 11:50.475
A scenario that's so bad
there's no other choice.

11:50.543 --> 11:51.772
-- A worst-case scenario.
-- Right.

11:51.844 --> 11:53.812
How bad do you want Gordon
not to break up with you?

11:53.879 --> 11:56.644
I -- I don't -- I don't think
that should enter into it.

11:56.716 --> 11:57.979
You're right.

11:58.050 --> 11:59.950
-- That it shouldn't enter into it?
-- Yes.

12:00.019 --> 12:01.009
-- I am.
-- I know.

12:01.087 --> 12:02.782
Mm-hmm.
I'm confident I'm right.

12:02.855 --> 12:04.846
And you know
what's happening tonight?

12:04.924 --> 12:06.653
The world
in which I'm confident

12:06.726 --> 12:09.423
is running right smack into
the world in which I'm not...

12:09.495 --> 12:10.894
I understand.

12:10.963 --> 12:12.761
...like when your parents
come to school.

12:12.832 --> 12:14.994
-- I'm just wondering -- and
don't get mad -- -- What?

12:15.067 --> 12:17.195
Would you care this much
if Sally wasn't involved?

12:17.269 --> 12:19.601
This isn't about Sally.

12:19.672 --> 12:20.605
Okay.

12:20.673 --> 12:22.698
This isn't about Sally.

12:22.775 --> 12:26.211
<i>Jeremy: Sally Sasser has Dana's
job on the 2:00 A.M. show,</i>

12:26.278 --> 12:27.746
<i>which is called
"West Coast Update."</i>

12:27.813 --> 12:29.440
<i>And while "West Coast Update"</i>

12:29.515 --> 12:32.041
<i>may be considered the ugly
stepsister around here,</i>

12:32.118 --> 12:34.746
<i>Sally Sasser is considered
anything but.</i>

12:34.820 --> 12:36.845
<i>And it hasn't escaped
Dana's notice</i>

12:36.922 --> 12:39.357
<i>that Sally's looks haven't
escaped Casey's.</i>

12:39.425 --> 12:41.189
Everything was fine
until your Pete

12:41.260 --> 12:43.729
started playing like two pounds
of stuffed cabbage.

12:43.796 --> 12:45.059
Do not blame this on Pete.

12:45.131 --> 12:47.031
How has he not put
that guy away yet?

12:47.099 --> 12:49.466
He's lulling him into
a false sense of security.

12:49.535 --> 12:51.264
I'm not handing the show
to Sally

12:51.337 --> 12:52.964
so I can meet
Gordon's friends.

12:53.038 --> 12:54.506
This is where I like to be.

12:54.573 --> 12:56.007
This is what I want to do.

12:56.075 --> 12:57.770
This is what I care about.

12:57.843 --> 12:59.709
This...

12:59.779 --> 13:01.008
and my honeydew.

13:01.046 --> 13:02.741
What's going on?

13:02.815 --> 13:04.715
Fedrigotti won the fourth set.

13:04.784 --> 13:06.809
-- Dana --
-- We're still in a hold.

13:06.886 --> 13:08.149
The show hasn't started yet?

13:08.220 --> 13:10.416
If the show had started, Gordon,
I'd be in the control room.

13:10.489 --> 13:13.550
Dana, they are gonna be
sitting at the restaurant.

13:13.626 --> 13:16.561
Honey, I'm really, really sorry,
but there's nothing I can do.

13:16.629 --> 13:17.858
Natalie can't do the show?

13:17.930 --> 13:19.796
-- I didn't prep it.
-- She didn't prep it.

13:19.865 --> 13:22.960
But, I mean, at this point, isn't it
just calling out numbers from a script?

13:23.035 --> 13:25.766
You produce a lot of live television
at the district attorney's office?

13:25.838 --> 13:28.239
-- Natalie... -- <i>U.S.</i> Attorney's office.
Can't, uh --

13:28.307 --> 13:29.968
Listen, I'm the executive
producer of "Sports Night."

13:30.042 --> 13:32.670
When I say I can't leave,
I can't leave. I'm not lying.

13:32.745 --> 13:34.611
-- I didn't say you were. -- I'll
be done in an hour and a half.

13:34.680 --> 13:36.114
Well, they'll be gone
in an hour and a half.

13:36.182 --> 13:37.980
I'll make it up to them.

13:38.050 --> 13:39.575
These were plans we had, Dana.

13:39.652 --> 13:41.245
News happens, Gordon.
This is news.

13:41.320 --> 13:43.152
This! This is sports.

13:43.222 --> 13:44.155
Yes!

13:44.223 --> 13:47.420
<i>Here are some people who are
staying late after school.</i>

13:47.493 --> 13:48.585
Hey, Sally.

13:48.661 --> 13:50.095
It's starting to get late.

13:50.162 --> 13:52.130
Yeah, I'm not dumping
the show, Sally.

13:52.198 --> 13:53.632
I'm saying they're tied up
in the fifth.

13:53.699 --> 13:54.894
-- I know.
-- It's not Pete's fault.

13:55.000 --> 13:56.661
-- No, Pete looks good.
-- <i>I'll say.</i>

13:56.735 --> 13:58.999
<i>Sally, you've met my boyfriend,
haven't you?</i>

13:59.104 --> 14:00.401
Gordon.

14:01.173 --> 14:04.268
That's funny.
My name's Gordon, too.

14:04.343 --> 14:06.004
Yes, that's hysterical, dear.

14:08.380 --> 14:10.109
Gordon had my shirt.

14:10.182 --> 14:11.172
What?

14:11.250 --> 14:12.513
He was actually wearing it.

14:12.585 --> 14:14.178
What do you mean?

14:14.253 --> 14:15.948
I'm saying he had my shirt.

14:16.021 --> 14:18.217
Whoa, start from the beginning.

14:18.290 --> 14:19.451
-- I'm talking about it.
-- I know.

14:19.525 --> 14:21.425
You asked me to talk about it,
I'm talking about it.

14:21.493 --> 14:23.689
-- Gordon had your shirt?
-- Yes.

14:23.762 --> 14:25.127
The shirt you left at Sally's?

14:25.197 --> 14:27.393
Yes.

14:27.466 --> 14:29.127
Gordon's sleeping with Sally?

14:29.201 --> 14:30.532
Yes.

14:30.603 --> 14:33.004
-- You're sure?
-- <i>Yes.</i>

14:33.072 --> 14:34.540
-- <i>How are you sure?</i>
-- <i>He told me.</i>

14:34.607 --> 14:37.201
-- <i>He told</i> you? -- <i>I'd figured it out.
He had my shirt</i> --

14:37.276 --> 14:38.641
And you've known about this
for how long?

14:38.711 --> 14:40.145
A week.

14:40.212 --> 14:42.010
-- <i>And you're telling me when?</i>
-- <i>I'm telling you now.</i>

14:47.720 --> 14:49.518
Why is Dana still with him?

14:49.588 --> 14:51.249
She doesn't know.

14:51.323 --> 14:53.451
-- <i>She doesn't know?</i>
-- <i>She doesn't know.</i>

14:55.628 --> 14:57.221
Because you haven't told her.

14:57.296 --> 14:58.821
That's right.

14:58.931 --> 15:01.730
Because to tell her
that Gordon slept with Sally...

15:01.767 --> 15:05.670
you'd have to tell her
that you slept with Sally.

15:07.072 --> 15:08.005
Hey.

15:08.073 --> 15:09.006
Hey.

15:09.074 --> 15:10.735
What's going on?

15:10.809 --> 15:12.277
Two games apiece
in the fifth.

15:12.344 --> 15:14.073
Finish the letter?

15:14.146 --> 15:16.274
-- I'm taking a break.
-- What's Dana thinking?

15:16.348 --> 15:19.045
-- About dumping the show?
-- <i>She's</i> not <i>gonna</i> dump it.

15:19.118 --> 15:20.608
Half past 12:00
and Gordon's here.

15:20.686 --> 15:23.246
I've known Dana for 15 years.
She's not dumping the show.

15:24.757 --> 15:26.691
-- You guys need anything?
-- Nah.

15:29.595 --> 15:32.292
She's not dumping the show.

15:32.364 --> 15:35.425
-- <i>Casey...</i> -- <i>I don't want
her to find out, Danny.</i>

15:39.438 --> 15:41.429
Yeah. All right.

15:55.921 --> 15:57.912
Just the market analyst
I'm looking for.

15:57.990 --> 15:59.253
What's going on?

15:59.325 --> 16:02.590
We're waiting for the tennis
match that wouldn't end to end.

16:02.661 --> 16:04.993
-- Listen...
-- Yes.

16:05.064 --> 16:06.054
I've called Elaine.

16:06.131 --> 16:09.362
I've told her that while she seems like a
very nice woman, I've met someone else.

16:09.435 --> 16:10.994
I've met a woman named
Rebecca --

16:11.070 --> 16:13.903
wonderful, sensational --
dare I add sexy -- Rebecca,

16:13.973 --> 16:15.839
and Rebecca is who I'm dating
right now.

16:15.908 --> 16:18.138
-- That is what I have told Elaine.
-- Really?

16:18.210 --> 16:20.076
No, but I left a message
on her machine to call me.

16:20.145 --> 16:21.772
-- Dan, listen to me.
-- Rebecca.

16:21.847 --> 16:23.440
-- Do you like “Beck“? Can
I call you Beck? -- No.

16:23.515 --> 16:26.507
-- Rebecca's fine. -- It's okay if
you want to go out with Elaine.

16:26.585 --> 16:27.711
I don't want to go out
with Elaine.

16:27.786 --> 16:29.083
-- It's okay if you do.
-- I don't.

16:29.154 --> 16:30.087
This isn't school.

16:30.155 --> 16:31.816
-- I know.
-- I'm sorry, Dan --

16:31.890 --> 16:33.085
-- Hey, Jeremy.
-- Hey.

16:33.158 --> 16:33.989
What's up?

16:34.059 --> 16:36.221
<i>There's a sort of impromptu meeting
in the conference room going on.</i>

16:36.295 --> 16:37.820
-- You might want to get in on it.
-- What's going on?

16:37.896 --> 16:39.830
It's quarter to 1:00.

16:39.898 --> 16:41.161
Sally?

16:41.233 --> 16:42.792
Yeah.

16:42.868 --> 16:44.495
<i>L</i> gotta g0-

16:44.570 --> 16:45.867
I want to see a show.

16:45.938 --> 16:48.635
I was told there'd be a live
sports show of some kind.

16:48.707 --> 16:51.108
I hear the anchors are kind of
cute, and I want to see the show.

16:51.176 --> 16:52.337
You and me both.

16:52.411 --> 16:54.004
I'll be down in my office.

16:54.079 --> 16:56.309
Will you give me a call when the
tennis match that wouldn't end ends?

16:56.382 --> 16:58.146
Absolutely.

16:58.250 --> 16:59.376
Rebecca...

16:59.418 --> 17:01.512
Yeah?

17:01.587 --> 17:04.488
I'd never make a fool
out of you.

17:04.556 --> 17:05.853
Okay.

17:05.924 --> 17:07.517
What made you say that?

17:09.328 --> 17:10.887
Nothing.
No reason.

17:10.963 --> 17:13.227
I'll see you in a few minutes.

17:15.701 --> 17:17.066
<i>Dana: Gordon</i> --

17:17.136 --> 17:19.537
-- This is the kind of thing --
-- Please, lower your voice.

17:19.605 --> 17:21.800
[Softly] This is the kind of
thing that I'm talking about.

17:21.874 --> 17:25.708
I'm very sorry that I can't spend
time with your friends tonight.

17:25.778 --> 17:27.837
No, no. You can spend time
with my friends,

17:27.913 --> 17:28.903
and you can spend time
with me.

17:28.981 --> 17:31.848
You just heard Sally tell you
that you can.

17:31.917 --> 17:35.649
Okay, and why don't we just have one of the
guys in your office take over your caseload?

17:35.721 --> 17:37.155
<i>-- He'!-
-- He'!-</i>

17:37.222 --> 17:38.917
Oh.
Late night for you guys.

17:38.991 --> 17:39.981
Hmm?

17:41.093 --> 17:43.494
L-| said late night
for you guys.

17:43.562 --> 17:44.859
Yeah.

17:44.930 --> 17:46.193
Yeah.

17:46.265 --> 17:47.255
Yeah.

17:49.768 --> 17:52.066
[Chuckles]

17:52.137 --> 17:56.506
Hey, Sally, you must have slept with this guy
Fedrigotti. How long you think he can keep at this?

17:56.575 --> 17:58.737
I was just thinking,
"It's been such a long time

17:58.844 --> 18:00.778
“sinoe Dan said something charming
to me,“ and then there it was.

18:00.813 --> 18:02.941
I do what I can.
What's going on?

18:03.015 --> 18:06.007
She just told you she could do
the show at this point.

18:06.085 --> 18:07.075
Let me tell you something.

18:07.152 --> 18:09.746
-- I know she could do the show at
this point. -- So what are you saying?

18:09.822 --> 18:12.416
I'm saying this is my show.
This isn't my hobby.

18:12.491 --> 18:15.085
And I'd appreciate it
if you didn't come in here

18:15.160 --> 18:17.629
and try to broker deals
between Sally and me.

18:17.696 --> 18:20.996
I need to get something
from you, Dana.

18:21.066 --> 18:23.034
I need a sign.

18:23.102 --> 18:25.434
I mean --
I thought you wanted a life.

18:27.673 --> 18:30.870
I need you
to give me something...

18:30.943 --> 18:32.968
OI'...

18:33.979 --> 18:35.640
What? Or what?

18:35.714 --> 18:38.206
[Sighs]

18:47.493 --> 18:50.554
You know what? It's 1:00 A.M.
I'm dumping "Sports Night."

18:50.629 --> 18:53.496
<i>Sally, you'll run the show
with my team in the room</i>

18:53.565 --> 18:55.465
<i>and Dan and Casey
at the desk.</i>

18:55.534 --> 18:56.626
<i>Jeremy: I'll never get it,
Louise.</i>

18:56.702 --> 19:00.104
<i>I understand what makes a woman think
that any man is better than nothing.</i>

19:00.205 --> 19:03.800
<i>I'll just never understand what makes
a woman think she's got nothing.</i>

19:03.842 --> 19:05.276
So there you go.
I'm not kidding.

19:05.344 --> 19:06.778
Let's go.
Let's do our show.

19:06.845 --> 19:08.370
<i>Dana handed off the show
for the night</i>

19:08.447 --> 19:10.848
<i>and went with Gordon
and his friends.</i>

19:10.916 --> 19:12.384
<i>Casey didn't see it coming,</i>

19:12.451 --> 19:14.681
<i>and to see his face
at the moment he found out,</i>

19:14.753 --> 19:17.450
<i>you'd think a string
inside of him broke.</i>

19:17.523 --> 19:19.582
<i>I have a hunch
it's gonna be a while</i>

19:19.658 --> 19:22.355
<i>before Casey and Dana are quite
the same with each other.</i>

19:22.427 --> 19:25.124
<i>Meanwhile, Sally ran the show
without a hitch.</i>

19:25.197 --> 19:26.858
2A and 3.

19:26.932 --> 19:28.161
Standby F/X-3.

19:28.233 --> 19:30.429
Show me Cincinnati and get me
Judy in Oakland.

19:30.502 --> 19:34.029
<i>Jeremy: Rebecca stuck around and
watched the show live from the studio.</i>

19:34.106 --> 19:36.131
<i>My guess is that either
she's never seen</i>

19:36.208 --> 19:39.576
<i>a live television broadcast
or she really likes Dan.</i>

19:39.645 --> 19:41.636
<i>Either way,
she was very excited.</i>

19:41.713 --> 19:44.341
Oh, my God, it's happening.
The show's starting.

19:44.416 --> 19:45.178
Yeah. Yes.

19:45.250 --> 19:47.014
-- <i>You guys are all set.</i>
-- <i>Have</i> a <i>good show.</i>

19:47.085 --> 19:48.951
-- Oh, my God.
-- Thank you, Alyson.

19:49.021 --> 19:50.614
-- You have 30 seconds.
-- Yes.

19:50.689 --> 19:51.815
Aren't you nervous?

19:51.890 --> 19:53.085
-- Rebecca...
-- Yeah?

19:53.158 --> 19:55.183
...remember I was talking to you
about being in show mode?

19:55.260 --> 19:57.126
-- Yeah.
-- Show mode.

19:57.196 --> 19:58.664
-- Show mode.
-- Oh.

19:58.730 --> 20:00.027
I'll, um --
<i>I'll</i> stand over there.

20:00.098 --> 20:01.293
-- Excellent.
-- Okay.

20:06.038 --> 20:08.166
-- Hard not to like her.
-- Tell me about it.

20:08.240 --> 20:12.074
<i>Fedrigotti lost his match, as
the whole world knew he would.</i>

20:12.144 --> 20:14.010
<i>But I wish you could've seen
the look in his eyes</i>

20:14.079 --> 20:16.138
<i>when Sampras hugged him
at the net.</i>

20:16.215 --> 20:17.182
<i>It was a sight to see.</i>

20:17.249 --> 20:18.717
20 seconds live.

20:18.784 --> 20:20.183
Good show, everybody.

20:20.252 --> 20:21.811
<i>All right,
ready for the lecture now?</i>

20:21.887 --> 20:24.447
<i>Under no circumstances
are you to leave school.</i>

20:24.523 --> 20:27.356
<i>End of lecture. There will
be a test on that material.</i>

20:27.426 --> 20:29.758
<i>Look, things are gonna be a
little rough for a little while,</i>

20:29.828 --> 20:32.354
<i>but, Lou, I want you to keep
your head in the game.</i>

20:32.431 --> 20:34.900
<i>We'll come out the other side
of this, no problem.</i>

20:35.000 --> 20:36.729
<i>In the meantime,
stay out of trouble, Louise.</i>

20:36.802 --> 20:37.735
<i>Love, Jeremy.</i>

20:37.803 --> 20:39.498
In 3...2...

20:39.571 --> 20:42.472
Good evening.
From New York City,

20:42.541 --> 20:45.374
I'm Casey McCall
alongside Dan Rydell.
