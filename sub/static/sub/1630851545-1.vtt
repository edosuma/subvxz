[narrator]<i> Alaska.</i>

<i>A vast, remote wilderness

00:49.482 --> 00:51.183
In the vastness of this country,

<i>it's easy
to be swallowed up in it.</i>

00:54.087 --> 00:56.789
[narrator]<i> Witnesses tell us</i>
<i>their shocking stories.</i>

00:56.823 --> 00:58.257
I was horrified.

00:58.291 --> 01:00.959
[narrator]<i> And we've gathered
some of the world's leading experts</i>

01:00.994 --> 01:02.561

01:44.104 --> 01:47.072
<i>that, if true,

01:48.141 --> 01:51.076
It is one of the biggest
unsolved mysteries

of my career.

01:53.113 --> 01:55.114
[narrator]<i> And evidence</i>

Why would they hide this?
Why would they bury this story?

02:04.390 --> 02:06.258
[narrator]<i> It's a mystery</i>
<i>that would spark</i>

02:06.292 --> 02:08.393

[Hugh]<i> Why aren't more people</i>

<i>Of all the extraordinary reports</i>

02:24.677 --> 02:27.746
<i>to have come out of Alaska,
the most bizarre</i>

02:27.780 --> 02:30.149
<i>must be that somewhere
in the wilderness,</i>

02:30.183 --> 02:33.118

02:34.487 --> 02:35.687

<i>Now, for the first time,

02:48.535 --> 02:49.835
<i>As we go in search</i>

02:49.869 --> 02:52.804
<i>of the Dark Pyramid

02:52.839 --> 02:54.873
[Linda]<i> Why haven't we heard</i>
<i>about this before?</i>

02:55.842 --> 02:57.176
This is the real deal.

02:57.210 --> 02:59.144
[narrator]
<i>The evidence they uncover</i>

02:59.179 --> 03:00.879
<i>is truly mind-blowing.</i>

03:06.219 --> 03:09.087
<i>The journey begins
in Dayton, Ohio,</i>

03:09.122 --> 03:11.857
<i>over 2,000 miles from Alaska.</i>

03:11.891 --> 03:15.227
<i>It's a center of the defense
and aeronautical industries.</i>

03:16.930 --> 03:19.865
<i>It's also home to former
Army Chief Warrant Officer,</i>

03:19.933 --> 03:22.067
<i>Doug Mutschler.</i>

03:22.101 --> 03:26.972
<i>For 15 years, Doug worked
in US counterintelligence.</i>

03:27.006 --> 03:30.075
Counterintelligence agent.
Investigated espionage,

03:30.109 --> 03:32.177
terrorism
against the United States.

03:33.846 --> 03:35.147
[narrator]<i> In 1989,</i>

03:35.181 --> 03:37.549
<i>Doug was posted
to Fort Richardson,</i>

03:37.584 --> 03:39.718
<i>on the outskirts
of Anchorage, Alaska.</i>

03:42.589 --> 03:45.524
<i>He had no idea then
of the bizarre journey</i>

03:45.558 --> 03:48.093
<i>he was about to embark upon.</i>

03:48.127 --> 03:51.997
When I arrived in Alaska
in '89, in September,

03:52.031 --> 03:54.132
first thing you do
is orientate yourself

03:54.167 --> 03:57.302
to your AO, area of operations.

03:57.337 --> 03:59.104
<i>So, I went and got some maps.</i>

04:00.607 --> 04:02.407
<i>So, when I was putting
the maps up,</i>

04:02.442 --> 04:04.309
<i>there was this one area.</i>

04:04.344 --> 04:05.978
<i>It was whited out.</i>

04:06.012 --> 04:09.748
<i>"This area
not surveyed to date."</i>

04:09.782 --> 04:12.384
And I'm looking
at the whole of Alaska.

04:12.418 --> 04:15.587
<i>I mean, that's a big place,
and it's all been surveyed,</i>

04:16.155 --> 04:19.124
<i>except this one area.</i>

04:20.293 --> 04:22.661
<i>With my counterintelligence
background, I was like,</i>

04:23.496 --> 04:24.763
<i>"they're hiding something."</i>

04:26.266 --> 04:28.767
<i>It's not my business,
and I let it go.</i>

04:30.336 --> 04:31.937
[narrator]
<i>Doug was used to working</i>

04:31.971 --> 04:33.238
<i>on a need-to-know basis.</i>

04:34.173 --> 04:35.407
<i>But, a few years later,</i>

04:35.441 --> 04:38.910
<i>an extraordinary event
magnified his suspicions.</i>

04:40.947 --> 04:45.050
Move forward to 1992,

04:45.084 --> 04:47.586
<i>I was sitting and watching TV
in the orderly room,</i>

04:47.620 --> 04:49.921
<i>and there's a news program on.</i>

04:49.956 --> 04:52.891
<i>And they're talking
about the detonation</i>

04:52.925 --> 04:54.359
<i>of a nuclear device in China.</i>

04:55.995 --> 04:59.431
<i>Part of the story
was that geologists</i>

04:59.465 --> 05:02.334
used that detonation
to get a better picture

05:02.368 --> 05:03.869
of the crust
and mantle of the Earth.

05:05.138 --> 05:06.672
[narrator]
<i>The news reports stated</i>

05:06.706 --> 05:08.640
<i>that the explosion was so great,</i>

05:08.675 --> 05:10.709
<i>that it sent shockwaves
underground</i>

05:10.743 --> 05:12.311
<i>through the fabric of the Earth.</i>

05:13.413 --> 05:16.548
<i>These shockwaves traveled
over 4,000 miles,</i>

05:16.582 --> 05:18.116
<i>all the way to Alaska,</i>

05:18.151 --> 05:19.384
<i>where they were picked up</i>

05:19.419 --> 05:21.653
<i>by earthquake
monitoring stations.</i>

05:21.688 --> 05:24.856
<i>By analyzing these waves,
scientists could tell</i>

05:24.891 --> 05:27.225
<i>the density of the rock
they passed through,</i>

05:28.695 --> 05:30.362
<i>and they detected
what appeared to be</i>

05:30.396 --> 05:32.664
<i>an enormous
subterranean structure</i>

05:32.699 --> 05:35.033
<i>shaped like a perfect pyramid.</i>

05:37.070 --> 05:40.806
They said, "in Alaska,
a pyramid was found,

05:40.840 --> 05:43.508
larger than the one in Giza."

05:45.244 --> 05:47.045
[narrator]
<i>The Great Pyramid of Giza,</i>

05:47.080 --> 05:50.282
<i>in Egypt, is over 450-feet high.</i>

05:50.316 --> 05:52.718
<i>It's one of the most
awe-inspiring feats</i>

05:52.752 --> 05:54.619
<i>of human engineering.</i>

05:54.654 --> 05:56.321
<i>And here was a news report</i>

05:56.356 --> 05:58.123
<i>stating that there was
a pyramid bigger</i>

05:58.157 --> 06:00.892
<i>than this in Alaska,
underground.</i>

06:02.462 --> 06:05.097
[Doug]<i> We got a pyramid</i>
<i>larger than the one in Giza.</i>

06:06.165 --> 06:07.332
<i>They showed it on the map.</i>

06:08.568 --> 06:12.070
And the whited-out area
I saw earlier, in '89,

06:12.105 --> 06:14.473
they correlated. Same area.

06:15.274 --> 06:17.075
Which I thought was,
"Oh, my God.

06:17.110 --> 06:18.377
That's what they're hiding."

06:20.747 --> 06:23.348
[narrator]<i> Andrew Gough</i>
<i>is a writer and historian</i>

06:23.383 --> 06:25.417
<i>who's been looking
into Doug's claims.</i>

06:25.918 --> 06:27.619
This is interesting.

06:27.653 --> 06:30.222
In May 22nd, 1992,

06:30.256 --> 06:32.791
the Chinese did detonate

06:32.825 --> 06:35.260
a massive underground
nuclear bomb.

06:35.294 --> 06:37.629
It was the largest test
they'd ever done.

06:37.663 --> 06:41.099
<i>About 70 times
bigger than Hiroshima.</i>

06:41.134 --> 06:43.602
<i>The US and the Soviets
had signed a treaty</i>

06:43.636 --> 06:45.404
<i>limiting the size
of these tests.</i>

06:46.439 --> 06:49.007
But the Chinese
weren't part of that deal.

06:49.041 --> 06:51.843
<i>Whether an underground pyramid
was detected</i>

06:51.878 --> 06:53.412
<i>by analyzing seismic waves,</i>

06:53.446 --> 06:55.347
well, there's
no independent proof of that.

06:55.381 --> 06:56.481
There's no record of it.

06:57.550 --> 06:58.617
<i>But Doug Mutschler,</i>

06:58.651 --> 07:01.586
<i>a former
counterintelligence figure,</i>

07:01.621 --> 07:02.854
<i>a well-respected guy,</i>

07:02.889 --> 07:05.190
why would he invent
such a story?

07:07.026 --> 07:08.927
<i>The location is vague,</i>

07:08.961 --> 07:11.496
<i>but it is somewhere out
in the flat plains</i>

07:11.531 --> 07:14.166
<i>behind Mount Denali
in central Alaska.</i>

07:16.202 --> 07:17.636
[narrator]<i> Doug set his VCR</i>

07:17.670 --> 07:19.504
<i>to record
the nightly news report</i>

07:19.539 --> 07:21.473
<i>he expected about the pyramid,</i>

07:21.507 --> 07:24.342
<i>a repeat of what he had seen
on TV earlier.</i>

07:25.378 --> 07:26.545
<i>But there was nothing.</i>

07:27.547 --> 07:29.481
[Doug]<i> Why was it not</i>
<i>on the news?</i>

07:29.515 --> 07:30.749
I called my dad,

07:30.783 --> 07:33.018
who was
a religious news watcher,

07:33.052 --> 07:36.655
in the morning, noon,
evening, late night.

07:36.689 --> 07:38.557
He said he didn't hear anything.

07:40.827 --> 07:43.462
[narrator]<i> Doug knew</i>
<i>he hadn't imagined the story.</i>

07:43.496 --> 07:44.463
<i>So, the next day,</i>

07:44.497 --> 07:46.965
<i>he went to visit
the local TV station</i>

07:46.967 --> 07:48.934
<i>that broadcast the news item</i>

07:48.968 --> 07:50.902
<i>to ask if he could see
a copy of it.</i>

07:50.937 --> 07:52.971
[Doug]<i> He said, "I don't know</i>
<i>what you're talking about.</i>

07:53.005 --> 07:54.439
<i>We have no story like that."</i>

07:54.474 --> 07:56.942
[narrator]<i> The station manager</i>
<i>denied broadcasting</i>

07:56.976 --> 07:58.210
<i>any such story.</i>

07:59.345 --> 08:01.413
[Doug]<i> He didn't know</i>
<i>what I was talking about.</i>

08:01.447 --> 08:02.514
<i>That was it.</i>

08:02.548 --> 08:04.216
That don't make no sense to me.

08:05.418 --> 08:06.852
[narrator]
<i>But, before he left,</i>

08:06.886 --> 08:09.521
<i>Doug was approached
by a more junior employee</i>

08:09.555 --> 08:11.756
<i>who had
some astonishing information</i>

08:11.791 --> 08:12.624
<i>for him.</i>

08:13.893 --> 08:16.795
She said two guys came in
and took the tapes.

08:18.631 --> 08:20.165
<i>I was stumped.</i>

08:21.868 --> 08:23.568
[narrator]<i> Two men</i>
<i>who were unknown</i>

08:23.603 --> 08:26.705
<i>to the employees
had confiscated the tapes.</i>

08:26.739 --> 08:29.441
<i>There was only one conclusion
Doug could draw.</i>

08:30.576 --> 08:33.411
I thought, "Oh, my God.
They are burying it."

08:36.115 --> 08:37.682
[Andrew]
<i>Doug Mutschler's story</i>

08:37.717 --> 08:39.184
<i>is really curious.</i>

08:39.218 --> 08:41.887
<i>There's this blank spot
on the map,</i>

08:41.921 --> 08:45.423
<i>and then he sees
a television news broadcast</i>

08:45.458 --> 08:48.727
<i>that says there's
an underground pyramid</i>

08:48.761 --> 08:50.829
<i>that appears to be
on the exact same spot.</i>

08:50.863 --> 08:53.031
<i>But, before
he can fix the location</i>

08:53.065 --> 08:55.800
by recording the newscast,
it's scrubbed.

08:55.835 --> 08:58.670
It's vanished.
It never shows again.

08:59.672 --> 09:03.275
That is not just weird,
that's really weird.

09:06.579 --> 09:09.481
[narrator]
<i>Jump forward a year. 1993.</i>

09:09.515 --> 09:11.316
<i>Doug's counterintelligence work</i>

09:11.350 --> 09:13.785
<i>took him east,
to Fort Meade, Maryland.</i>

09:15.321 --> 09:18.823
<i>Knowing that it was home
to extensive military records,</i>

09:18.858 --> 09:21.960
<i>he introduced himself
to the archivist.</i>

09:21.994 --> 09:23.962
And I thought,
"Why don't I just ask him

09:23.996 --> 09:25.263
about Alaska,

09:25.298 --> 09:27.399
<i>see if there's any
archaeological stuff there?"</i>

09:27.433 --> 09:30.702
And then he said,
"go down to such number.

09:30.736 --> 09:32.804
<i>It should be in the first
or second drawer."</i>

09:33.940 --> 09:37.208
<i>I went into the second drawer,
saw this Alaska folder,</i>

09:37.243 --> 09:38.343
took it out.

09:38.377 --> 09:40.478
Didn't know what it was,
didn't know what it contained,

09:40.513 --> 09:42.247
but I brought it back
and sat down.

09:45.084 --> 09:47.152
I wasn't sitting there
more than a couple minutes

09:47.186 --> 09:48.553
and these two guys come over.

09:48.588 --> 09:51.089
<i>"You're not authorized
to have that."</i>

09:51.123 --> 09:53.258

09:53.292 --> 09:54.326
<i>"You're not allowed to."</i>

09:58.431 --> 09:59.831
<i>If you don't have

09:59.865 --> 10:01.199
<i>you don't have the need to know.</i>

10:01.233 --> 10:03.802
So, you don't stick your nose
where it don't belong.

10:05.137 --> 10:07.105
[narrator]<i> The big question</i>

10:07.139 --> 10:08.607
<i>why all the secrecy?</i>

<i>He left it,

10:13.846 --> 10:15.246
<i>The years went by.</i>

10:15.281 --> 10:18.984

<i>named Doug Mutschler.</i>

10:42.441 --> 10:44.743
He said, "there is
something underground

10:44.777 --> 10:50.148
in Alaska
that was public in 1992,

10:50.182 --> 10:52.350
and somebody didn't want
the world to know."

10:53.619 --> 10:57.689
He's puzzled and suspicious,
and he did have my attention.

10:59.792 --> 11:02.160
So, I began making phone calls.

11:02.194 --> 11:05.130
<i>I was reaching out,
trying to find anybody</i>

11:05.164 --> 11:08.667
who might have information
about a pyramid

11:08.701 --> 11:09.834
that was discovered

11:09.869 --> 11:12.737
by that nuclear experiment
in '92.

11:14.206 --> 11:16.307
[narrator]<i> It wasn't long</i>
<i>before Linda received</i>

11:16.342 --> 11:18.543
<i>a mysterious
anonymous phone call</i>

11:18.577 --> 11:20.145
<i>in support of Doug's claims.</i>

11:21.681 --> 11:23.314
[Linda]
<i>I get a call from a man</i>

11:23.349 --> 11:26.217
<i>on the East Coast
about how there was</i>

11:26.252 --> 11:30.388
<i>a huge pyramid
underground in Alaska</i>

11:30.423 --> 11:33.358
of such age, no one knows.

11:34.427 --> 11:36.461
[narrator]<i> To this day,</i>
<i>Linda doesn't know</i>

11:36.495 --> 11:38.329
<i>the identity
of the mystery caller,</i>

11:38.364 --> 11:40.832
<i>but he clearly had
inside knowledge.</i>

11:40.866 --> 11:43.168
<i>He even gave the pyramid a name.</i>

11:43.202 --> 11:45.170
<i>The Dark Pyramid.</i>

11:45.204 --> 11:48.173
He said it was a black,
solid black stone.

11:48.207 --> 11:51.376
That's why they called it
the Dark Pyramid.

11:51.410 --> 11:53.778
[Andrew]<i> We don't know</i>
<i>who the caller was,</i>

11:53.813 --> 11:55.880
but he appears to know
what he's talking about.

11:55.915 --> 11:58.817
For a start, he knows
that it was made of stone,

11:58.851 --> 12:03.922
<i>he knows that it was black,
and he knows the exact size.</i>

12:05.991 --> 12:08.860
This big, dark pyramid

12:08.894 --> 12:12.764
is 550 feet
from the base to the top.

12:13.966 --> 12:17.535
[narrator]<i> A 550-foot pyramid</i>
<i>made of dark stone,</i>

12:17.570 --> 12:19.070
<i>buried underground,</i>

12:19.105 --> 12:21.539
<i>which was being
investigated secretly</i>

12:21.574 --> 12:22.807
<i>by the military.</i>

12:24.810 --> 12:28.012
<i>She didn't know it then,
but Linda was about to hear</i>

12:28.047 --> 12:31.416
<i>some extraordinary
first-hand evidence.</i>

12:31.450 --> 12:34.252
<i>It was to become
the most astonishing story</i>

12:34.286 --> 12:35.620
<i>of her career.</i>

12:35.654 --> 12:38.289
In my mind, this is the largest,

12:38.324 --> 12:40.925
biggest archaeological find
in history.

12:40.960 --> 12:42.160
I mean, in all of history.

12:56.742 --> 12:58.143
[narrator]<i> In 2012,</i>

12:58.177 --> 13:00.945
<i>investigative journalist
Linda Moulton Howe</i>

13:01.680 --> 13:03.214
<i>began to receive reports</i>

13:03.249 --> 13:05.583
<i>of a mysterious
underground pyramid</i>

13:05.618 --> 13:08.686
<i>somewhere in the middle
of the Alaska Triangle.</i>

13:09.522 --> 13:11.790
<i>Her curiosity had been triggered</i>

13:11.824 --> 13:13.825
<i>by the evidence
of a former soldier</i>

13:13.859 --> 13:16.861
<i>and counterintelligence
operative, Doug Mutschler.</i>

13:18.931 --> 13:23.101
<i>Then, in 2013, Linda received
an email from this man,</i>

13:23.135 --> 13:25.370
<i>radio host and fellow journalist</i>

13:25.404 --> 13:26.504
<i>Bruce Pearson.</i>

13:27.473 --> 13:30.708
<i>He had an extraordinary story
to tell.</i>

13:30.743 --> 13:32.844
The first I had ever heard
of the Dark Pyramid,

13:33.813 --> 13:35.914
was in 1978.

13:35.948 --> 13:38.316
I was living in New Mexico, I'd
just finished the Bachelor's degree,

13:38.350 --> 13:40.251
<i>and I got a call from my father,</i>

13:40.286 --> 13:42.353
<i>who was teaching
in Northern Alaska.</i>

13:43.455 --> 13:46.090
[narrator]<i> Bruce's father,</i>
<i>a World War II vet,</i>

13:46.125 --> 13:48.693
<i>was working in a school
in a remote location.</i>

13:49.495 --> 13:50.662
<i>And Bruce could tell</i>

13:50.696 --> 13:52.564
<i>by the tone
in his father's voice</i>

13:52.598 --> 13:54.799
<i>that something extraordinary
had happened.</i>

13:56.302 --> 13:57.936
[Bruce]<i> He said,</i>
<i>"hey, I got to tell you</i>

13:57.970 --> 13:59.971
<i>about this experience I had.</i>

14:00.005 --> 14:02.040
<i>Guys came through
on a helicopter</i>

14:02.074 --> 14:04.375
<i>and we got talking,
and it turned out</i>

14:04.410 --> 14:07.979
<i>they were taking
some important pieces</i>

14:08.013 --> 14:12.050
of equipment
out to a secret base

14:12.084 --> 14:13.251
<i>near Mount Denali."</i>

14:14.987 --> 14:16.621
[Andrew]<i> A secret base?</i>

14:16.655 --> 14:19.290
These guys
actually told Lee Pearson

14:19.325 --> 14:21.626
that they were taking him
to a secret base

14:21.660 --> 14:23.061
in the Alaska Triangle.

14:23.095 --> 14:25.830
<i>And what's so compelling
about this story</i>

14:25.898 --> 14:27.866
<i>is that Lee is a teacher</i>

14:27.900 --> 14:30.034
<i>and a military veteran himself,</i>

14:30.036 --> 14:33.004
and he's relaying
the story to his son.

14:33.038 --> 14:35.006
So, why would he make it up?

14:37.009 --> 14:38.810
[narrator]
<i>At over 20,000 feet,</i>

14:38.844 --> 14:41.312
<i>Mount Denali
is the highest mountain</i>

14:41.347 --> 14:42.947
<i>in North America,</i>

14:42.982 --> 14:45.116
<i>and in the middle
of a huge wilderness</i>

14:45.150 --> 14:47.485
<i>of over 6 million acres.</i>

14:47.519 --> 14:50.521
<i>More people live in one block
in New York City</i>

14:50.523 --> 14:53.024
<i>than live on the hundreds
of miles of plains</i>

14:53.058 --> 14:55.159
<i>beyond Mount Denali.</i>

14:55.194 --> 14:57.829
Then, something extraordinary
happened.

14:57.863 --> 15:00.665
Because Bruce's father
is ex-forces,

15:00.733 --> 15:04.669
<i>the team on the chopper
invite him along</i>

15:04.703 --> 15:08.072
on their journey
to the secret base.

15:10.776 --> 15:12.377
[narrator]
<i>After flying to the limit</i>

15:12.411 --> 15:13.778
<i>of the helicopter's range,</i>

15:13.812 --> 15:16.414
<i>they reach
their mysterious destination.</i>

15:17.783 --> 15:21.886
They landed
in a rather barren spot.

15:25.491 --> 15:27.692
<i>Guys with black uniforms
and no insignias on them</i>

15:27.726 --> 15:29.360
took their stuff
off the helicopter.

15:29.395 --> 15:31.296
They didn't even
shut down the turbines.

15:34.066 --> 15:37.368
Black uniforms with no insignia?

15:37.403 --> 15:38.703
That's pretty weird.

15:38.737 --> 15:41.272
It's like something
out of a James Bond film.

15:41.307 --> 15:44.909
Who were these people?
Where were they from?

15:44.944 --> 15:46.511
All we can surmise,

15:46.545 --> 15:50.882
it was something
very covert and very secret.

15:53.452 --> 15:55.386
[narrator]<i> While there,</i>
<i>Doug's father</i>

15:55.421 --> 15:58.022
<i>overheard some talk
between the uniformed men</i>

15:58.057 --> 15:59.123
<i>and the pilot.</i>

15:59.825 --> 16:01.359
They said that there were...

16:01.393 --> 16:03.094
there was
some underground facility

16:03.128 --> 16:05.196
that the military
was trying to investigate.

16:05.230 --> 16:07.432
<i>They didn't know who
had built it or what it was,</i>

16:07.466 --> 16:09.167
<i>but it was
an underground pyramid,</i>

16:09.201 --> 16:11.302
and that
it was pretty hush-hush.

16:11.337 --> 16:13.604
[Andrew]
<i>An underground pyramid!</i>

16:13.639 --> 16:17.108
<i>Just like Doug Mutschler
had seen on the TV news!</i>

16:17.142 --> 16:20.845
Now, that is intriguing,
to say the least.

16:22.815 --> 16:25.616
[narrator]<i> The exact location</i>
<i>was still unknown.</i>

16:26.385 --> 16:28.519
<i>But, now, Linda Moulton Howe</i>

16:28.554 --> 16:32.190
<i>had two named witnesses
to the Dark Pyramid.</i>

16:32.224 --> 16:34.292
<i>But who built it, and what for?</i>

16:35.728 --> 16:37.595
<i>It seemed that even the military</i>

16:37.629 --> 16:39.230
<i>didn't have the answers.</i>

16:40.299 --> 16:42.333
<i>Then, in 2017,</i>

16:42.368 --> 16:44.502
<i>Linda received
an email that contained</i>

16:44.536 --> 16:46.537
<i>some extraordinary revelations.</i>

16:47.439 --> 16:50.108
[Linda]<i> I got an email</i>
<i>from a woman,</i>

16:50.142 --> 16:54.078
<i>who has requested
to remain anonymous,</i>

16:54.113 --> 16:57.382
<i>but she was having
remote viewing experiences.</i>

16:58.317 --> 17:01.853
And she said to me that she felt

17:01.887 --> 17:04.822
she was going
out of body at night

17:04.857 --> 17:07.725
and that she was going
into Alaska,

17:07.760 --> 17:09.761
<i>that she saw structures</i>

17:10.696 --> 17:12.697
that might have something to do

17:12.731 --> 17:15.066
with my Dark Pyramid
investigation.

17:15.100 --> 17:17.535
[narrator]
<i>Exactly what the woman saw</i>

17:17.569 --> 17:19.037
<i>was way beyond</i>

17:19.071 --> 17:21.672
<i>anything Linda
could possibly have imagined.</i>

17:22.674 --> 17:24.876
<i>The story
of the underground pyramid</i>

17:24.910 --> 17:28.413
<i>was about to take
a dark and terrifying turn.</i>

17:41.427 --> 17:43.294
[narrator]<i> Evidence</i>
<i>was already building</i>

17:43.328 --> 17:45.563
<i>for a mysterious
underground pyramid</i>

17:45.597 --> 17:47.031
<i>in the Alaska Triangle,</i>

17:47.066 --> 17:49.967
<i>when investigative reporter
Linda Moulton Howe</i>

17:50.002 --> 17:53.438
<i>received
some extraordinary testimony.</i>

17:53.472 --> 17:56.140
<i>A woman was having
psychic experiences</i>

17:56.175 --> 17:59.677
<i>and had traveled in her mind
to the Dark Pyramid.</i>

17:59.711 --> 18:01.712
[Linda]<i> Human beings</i>

18:01.747 --> 18:04.282
can have something happen
in their life,

18:04.316 --> 18:08.219
in which some part
can go into remote viewing

18:08.253 --> 18:12.090
and what begins
to come out as a picture.

18:12.891 --> 18:14.292
[narrator]
<i>With remote viewing,</i>

18:14.326 --> 18:17.962
<i>the mind travels to a specific
geographic location</i>

18:17.996 --> 18:22.533
<i>and, with intensive focus,
a mental picture is drawn.</i>

18:22.568 --> 18:25.036
<i>It sounds farfetched,
but it's a technique</i>

18:25.070 --> 18:27.371
<i>that has been taken
extremely seriously</i>

18:27.406 --> 18:29.107
<i>at some very high levels.</i>

18:30.375 --> 18:32.376
<i>In fact, in the 1980s,</i>

18:32.411 --> 18:35.046
<i>the CIA employed remote viewers</i>

18:35.114 --> 18:38.049
<i>as psychic spies
to travel in their minds</i>

18:38.083 --> 18:40.051
<i>to set points
in the Soviet Union,</i>

18:40.085 --> 18:41.986
<i>and report back
on what they saw.</i>

18:43.355 --> 18:46.157
<i>This top-secret initiative
even had a name,</i>

18:46.925 --> 18:49.460
<i>Project Stargate.</i>

18:49.495 --> 18:52.797
<i>Hugh Newman is a writer
and researcher from England</i>

18:52.831 --> 18:54.999
<i>who's been looking
into the remote viewing claims</i>

18:55.033 --> 18:56.968
<i>made by Linda's psychic witness.</i>

18:57.903 --> 18:59.737
So, the experience
that this woman had

18:59.771 --> 19:02.006
when she had
an out-of-body experience

19:02.040 --> 19:05.843
and went down into the ground
and witnessed this pyramid,

19:05.878 --> 19:09.514
<i>is something that the CIA
have been using for decades.</i>

19:09.548 --> 19:10.681
And it does work.

19:12.885 --> 19:14.785
[narrator]<i> In fact,</i>
<i>the experience</i>

19:14.820 --> 19:17.255
<i>of Linda's new witness
was so vivid,</i>

19:17.289 --> 19:19.123
<i>that she was able
to draw sketches</i>

19:19.158 --> 19:21.792
<i>and make computer diagrams
of her experience.</i>

19:24.029 --> 19:25.963
So, the first one
is quite interesting.

19:26.732 --> 19:28.766
<i>And it shows a small building,</i>

19:28.800 --> 19:31.335
<i>and then she was led into that.</i>

19:31.370 --> 19:34.105
And, if we look
at the next image,

19:34.139 --> 19:37.508
<i>there was a long staircase
going down, down, down,</i>

19:37.543 --> 19:39.410
<i>with a whole group of people.</i>

19:39.444 --> 19:41.546
<i>Then, she arrived
at an elevator.</i>

19:43.315 --> 19:46.117
<i>And this went down
much further into the ground,</i>

19:46.151 --> 19:48.352
<i>possibly down to 150 feet or so</i>

19:48.387 --> 19:49.554
<i>below the surface.</i>

19:51.456 --> 19:53.591
<i>And, then,
she was led into this room.</i>

19:53.625 --> 19:55.960
<i>It almost looks like
some kind of lab</i>

19:55.994 --> 19:58.429
<i>or military facility.</i>

19:58.463 --> 20:01.666
She kind of zoomed in
to look in through the window,

20:01.700 --> 20:04.302
<i>and you'd see
this black sloping wall,</i>

20:04.336 --> 20:07.371
<i>which is one side
of the pyramid itself.</i>

20:09.007 --> 20:11.809
[Linda]<i> And she knew</i>
<i>it was a pyramid structure.</i>

20:11.843 --> 20:15.012
She knew it was made
out of black stone.

20:16.648 --> 20:19.750
[narrator]<i> An underground</i>
<i>black stone pyramid,</i>

20:19.785 --> 20:22.920
<i>just as Doug Mutschler
and Bruce Pearson had stated,</i>

20:22.955 --> 20:25.289
<i>and just
as had been reported to Linda</i>

20:25.324 --> 20:27.158
<i>by the anonymous caller.</i>

20:28.660 --> 20:30.528
<i>And around the solid pyramid,</i>

20:30.562 --> 20:35.666
<i>a complex network of tunnels
and underground chambers.</i>

20:35.701 --> 20:38.502
<i>But the biggest surprise
was still to come.</i>

20:39.972 --> 20:42.340
Perhaps
the most dramatic testimony

20:42.374 --> 20:45.576
that came out
of her out-of-body experience,

20:45.611 --> 20:47.812
her visit
to the pyramid, psychically,

20:47.846 --> 20:49.747
was the fact that the guide,

20:49.781 --> 20:53.084
<i>the leader who was taking them
down to look at the pyramid,</i>

20:53.118 --> 20:55.453
<i>was not human.</i>

20:55.487 --> 21:01.726
She had a clear understanding
that it wasn't human.

21:02.761 --> 21:05.329
It was a humanoid in charge,

21:05.364 --> 21:07.598
but it was not
homosapiens sapiens.

21:08.667 --> 21:10.468
[narrator]
<i>Now, for the first time,</i>

21:10.502 --> 21:12.903
<i>things begin to fall into place.</i>

21:15.207 --> 21:16.240
<i>The Dark Pyramid</i>

21:16.275 --> 21:18.643
<i>is super-advanced

<i>and they have humans
working on it with them.</i>

21:21.346 --> 21:23.748
[Hugh]<i> The final image</i>
<i>is really interesting,</i>

21:23.782 --> 21:26.550

what looks like energy

21:26.585 --> 21:28.519
<i>coming out from the central area</i>

21:28.553 --> 21:30.254
<i>of the Black Pyramid itself.</i>

21:33.892 --> 21:35.159
[narrator]<i> This gives a clue</i>

21:35.193 --> 21:36.827
<i>as to the purpose
of the pyramid.</i>

21:36.862 --> 21:39.730
<i>The woman said

<i>and for a very specific reason.</i>

21:44.169 --> 21:46.103
[Linda]<i> Why it was here,</i>

21:46.905 --> 21:50.207
<i>was to energize UFO discs</i>

21:50.242 --> 21:52.710
<i>that would fly over the vortex,</i>

21:52.744 --> 21:54.545
<i>and they would get charged.</i>

21:58.250 --> 22:01.552
<i>Its function
has been energy restoring</i>

22:01.586 --> 22:03.254
<i>for UFO craft.</i>

22:04.856 --> 22:05.923
[Hugh]<i> The whole system</i>

22:05.957 --> 22:08.659
<i>is actually an energy generator.</i>

22:08.694 --> 22:10.795
<i>It absorbs energy from the Earth</i>

22:10.829 --> 22:13.164
<i>or from the cosmos,
and recharges it</i>

22:13.198 --> 22:15.900
and pumps it out
to power the crafts

22:15.934 --> 22:17.468
of the otherworldly beings

22:17.502 --> 22:19.337
who are coming in and out
of our atmosphere.

22:22.274 --> 22:23.407
[Andrew]<i> The pyramid</i>

22:23.442 --> 22:27.278
<i>is an underground
alien power generator?</i>

22:28.180 --> 22:29.947
This is simply astonishing.

22:31.083 --> 22:32.216
[narrator]<i> If this spot</i>

22:32.250 --> 22:33.951
<i>in the middle
of the Alaska Triangle</i>

22:33.985 --> 22:36.987
<i>is where alien craft
come to be recharged,</i>

22:37.022 --> 22:38.155
<i>then this could explain</i>

22:38.190 --> 22:41.659
<i>the large number of UFOs
seen in the state.</i>

22:41.693 --> 22:45.196
<i>Over 6,500 sightings
have been reported.</i>

22:46.798 --> 22:48.866
<i>One of the most
famous encounters</i>

22:48.900 --> 22:50.468
<i>was in 1986,</i>

22:50.502 --> 22:52.970
<i>when the crew
of a Japanese airline flight</i>

22:53.004 --> 22:54.205
<i>watched in horror</i>

22:54.239 --> 22:56.574
<i>as two UFOs taunted their plane.</i>

22:58.276 --> 22:59.710
<i>And, in 2003,</i>

22:59.745 --> 23:01.946
<i>in a deserted section
of the triangle,</i>

23:01.980 --> 23:05.182
<i>an entire squadron
of UFOs appeared.</i>

23:05.217 --> 23:07.118
<i>Linda's psychic witness</i>

23:07.152 --> 23:10.221
<i>could have been drawn
to an alien stop-off point,</i>

23:10.255 --> 23:12.656
<i>perhaps the only one on Earth.</i>

23:12.691 --> 23:16.427
<i>Perhaps, even, the only one
in our part of the cosmos.</i>

23:17.262 --> 23:18.396
<i>The psychic traveler</i>

23:18.430 --> 23:20.231
<i>may even have
inadvertently stumbled</i>

23:20.265 --> 23:23.067
<i>across the answer
to an age-old mystery.</i>

23:24.202 --> 23:27.071
<i>What was the purpose
of the ancient pyramids?</i>

23:30.475 --> 23:34.445
[Linda]<i> Even though</i>
<i>nothing about her story</i>

23:34.479 --> 23:36.847
<i>and her dealing
with humanoid ETs</i>

23:36.882 --> 23:38.883
<i>can be proved,
she can't prove it,</i>

23:40.419 --> 23:42.219
I think it is worth considering.

23:48.994 --> 23:50.494
[narrator]
<i>Writer and researcher</i>

23:50.529 --> 23:51.562
<i>Jonny Enoch</i>

23:51.596 --> 23:53.264
<i>heard about
Linda's investigation.</i>

23:54.766 --> 23:57.201
<i>As well as being
a clinical hypnotherapist,</i>

23:57.235 --> 24:00.104
<i>Jonny is an expert
on ancient consciousness</i>

24:00.138 --> 24:01.906
<i>and ancient technologies.</i>

24:01.940 --> 24:04.708
<i>He immediately saw
how the Dark Pyramid</i>

24:04.743 --> 24:07.211
<i>could relate to his research.</i>

24:07.245 --> 24:09.346
When I first learned
about the Dark Pyramid,

24:09.381 --> 24:12.583
I got very excited
because I saw connections

24:12.617 --> 24:14.952
to other sites
I'd been investigating.

24:17.656 --> 24:20.624
<i>I'd been researching
pyramids around the world,</i>

24:20.659 --> 24:24.395
<i>and we find pyramids
on both sides of the Atlantic.</i>

24:24.429 --> 24:27.531
<i>We find them in Egypt,
we find them in China,</i>

24:27.566 --> 24:30.568
we find them in Indonesia.
They're all over the world.

24:32.103 --> 24:33.404
[narrator]<i> It's Jonny's view</i>

24:33.438 --> 24:36.540
<i>that all these pyramids
were built to serve a purpose,</i>

24:36.575 --> 24:39.777
<i>and that is to tap
into the natural energy</i>

24:39.811 --> 24:40.744
<i>of the Earth.</i>

24:42.380 --> 24:44.448
There's an energy grid
on our planet.

24:44.483 --> 24:46.383
<i>Now, these have been
traditionally called</i>

24:46.418 --> 24:48.886
<i>"ley lines." The Earth
is equipped with these.</i>

24:48.920 --> 24:52.022
<i>Naturally, the ancients
knew how to tap into that</i>

24:52.057 --> 24:54.525
<i>using pyramids and obelisks,</i>

24:54.559 --> 24:55.726
<i>which were nothing more</i>

24:55.760 --> 24:57.761
<i>than magnifiers of that energy.</i>

25:00.732 --> 25:02.333
[narrator]
<i>This theory has pyramids</i>

25:02.367 --> 25:03.834
<i>as ancient power stations,</i>

25:05.136 --> 25:08.205
<i>and an underground pyramid
would be no exception.</i>

25:10.275 --> 25:12.076
I believe the Dark Pyramid

25:12.110 --> 25:14.778
is an advanced form
of ancient technology

25:14.813 --> 25:16.981
that was used by a civilization

25:17.015 --> 25:18.516
that was here
a very long time ago.

25:20.051 --> 25:22.019
[narrator]<i> Hugh Newman</i>
<i>agrees that the woman</i>

25:22.053 --> 25:23.854
<i>who had
the out-of-body experience</i>

25:23.889 --> 25:26.724
<i>could've been witnessing
something from another era.</i>

25:27.993 --> 25:29.927
So, these
out-of-body experiences

25:29.961 --> 25:32.997
that people have
can traverse time and space.

25:33.031 --> 25:34.832
So, they could project back
into the past,

25:34.866 --> 25:37.034
<i>the present, or even the future.</i>

25:37.036 --> 25:39.803
<i>So, this pyramid could go back
thousands of years.</i>

25:42.207 --> 25:43.841
What's so mind-blowing

25:43.875 --> 25:46.443
is that this suggests
a connection

25:46.478 --> 25:50.681
<i>between the ancients
and the aliens in Alaska.</i>

25:51.316 --> 25:53.617
Ancient pyramid technology

25:53.652 --> 25:56.086
could've been brought to Alaska

25:56.121 --> 25:58.322
from beings from another world,

25:58.356 --> 26:02.092
from another planet,
and that could explain

26:02.127 --> 26:04.428
<i>what we're seeing
with the Dark Pyramid.</i>

26:06.298 --> 26:08.532
[narrator]
<i>Linda Moulton Howe agrees.</i>

26:08.567 --> 26:11.302
<i>In her view,
the alien presence on Earth</i>

26:11.336 --> 26:14.204
<i>goes back a long way
before mankind's.</i>

26:14.739 --> 26:17.207
Alien intelligences

26:17.242 --> 26:20.411
have been working on our planet

26:20.445 --> 26:23.080
<i>for millions of years,</i>

26:23.114 --> 26:25.316
<i>and here is their power machine</i>

26:25.350 --> 26:26.884
<i>for everything they're doing.</i>

26:26.918 --> 26:28.319
[Hugh]<i> If this is for real,</i>

26:28.353 --> 26:29.920
it could be one
of the biggest stories

26:29.955 --> 26:30.921
that's ever broken.

26:34.626 --> 26:36.594
[narrator]
<i>If the Alaska Triangle's</i>

26:36.628 --> 26:37.661
<i>Dark Pyramid</i>

26:37.696 --> 26:40.898
<i>is some kind of ancient
or alien power station,</i>

26:40.932 --> 26:43.033
<i>it begs many questions.</i>

26:43.068 --> 26:45.836
<i>Who built it?
How did they build it?</i>

26:45.870 --> 26:46.937
<i>How did it work?</i>

26:49.774 --> 26:51.475
<i>Perhaps it was these questions</i>

26:51.509 --> 26:53.177
<i>the military were investigating</i>

26:53.211 --> 26:56.847
<i>when Bruce Pearson's father
made his unexpected visit.</i>

26:58.116 --> 27:01.652
<i>Now, the hunt is on
for the underground pyramid.</i>

27:01.686 --> 27:03.721
<i>Four decades after his father</i>

27:03.755 --> 27:06.624
<i>took that mysterious
helicopter flight,</i>

27:06.658 --> 27:09.360
<i>Bruce Pearson
is going in search.</i>

27:22.040 --> 27:24.074
[narrator]<i> A dark</i>
<i>underground pyramid</i>

27:24.109 --> 27:25.709
<i>of alien origin,</i>

27:25.744 --> 27:29.279
<i>hidden somewhere in the middle
of the Alaskan wilderness.</i>

27:29.314 --> 27:31.281
<i>It's one
of the Alaska Triangle's</i>

27:31.316 --> 27:33.350
<i>most intriguing stories.</i>

27:33.385 --> 27:34.952
I'd say the fact
that we got something

27:34.986 --> 27:38.055
like this potentially buried
under the ground in Alaska

27:38.089 --> 27:40.391
<i>is absolutely astonishing.</i>

27:40.425 --> 27:41.692
<i>It suggests the connection</i>

27:41.726 --> 27:45.796
between us
and these otherworldly beings.

27:47.298 --> 27:49.333
[narrator]<i> Having made</i>
<i>another appeal for help</i>

27:49.367 --> 27:51.602
<i>on her website,
investigative journalist</i>

27:51.636 --> 27:54.838
<i>Linda Moulton Howe
had a breakthrough.</i>

27:54.873 --> 27:57.775
A retired Navy captain
got in touch with me

27:57.809 --> 28:00.778
and sent me maps and photos,
a whole bunch of them.

28:02.113 --> 28:04.348
[narrator]<i> At first,</i>
<i>the reason was unclear,</i>

28:04.382 --> 28:07.217
<i>but one small patch
of ground was highlighted.</i>

28:08.486 --> 28:11.522
[Linda]<i> There is</i>
<i>a rectangular patch.</i>

28:11.556 --> 28:13.524
It's much different
than the surrounding,

28:13.558 --> 28:14.658
and it's geometric.

28:14.693 --> 28:16.160
That's what
I'd been looking for,

28:16.194 --> 28:17.695
anything
that would be geometric,

28:17.729 --> 28:20.364
<i>because nature doesn't work
in 90-degree angles.</i>

28:21.866 --> 28:24.368
[narrator]<i> Could this be</i>
<i>the site of the Dark Pyramid?</i>

28:27.272 --> 28:29.073
<i>Armed with this new information,</i>

28:29.107 --> 28:32.142
<i>Bruce Pearson,
son of a key eyewitness,</i>

28:32.177 --> 28:34.511
<i>is going to try
to find the pyramid.</i>

28:36.014 --> 28:37.481
<i>And he's enlisted the help</i>

28:37.515 --> 28:40.684
<i>of experienced bush pilot
Eric Rovey.</i>

28:40.719 --> 28:42.352
[Eric] So,
the coordinates you gave me

28:42.387 --> 28:43.954
are right out here, okay?

28:43.988 --> 28:45.122
Here we are, in Healy,

28:45.156 --> 28:46.590
a little more
than 100 miles away.

28:46.624 --> 28:47.958
This is Denali National Park.

28:47.992 --> 28:50.294
It's about the same size
as Vermont, New Hampshire.

28:51.996 --> 28:53.897
So, we're going to cut across
the outer range

28:53.932 --> 28:55.466
and, basically,
head straight out,

28:55.500 --> 28:56.834
see what we can find.
Let's do it.

28:58.870 --> 29:00.637
[Bruce]<i> We're going</i>
<i>to rig a plane up</i>

29:00.672 --> 29:03.340
with a number of cameras
so that we can document

29:03.374 --> 29:05.642
<i>anything that we may not see
with our eyes</i>

29:05.677 --> 29:07.644
<i>during the actual event.</i>

29:07.679 --> 29:10.547
<i>I think it's important to note
that, where we're going,</i>

29:10.582 --> 29:13.183
<i>is probably one
of the most remote places</i>

29:13.218 --> 29:14.218
<i>in North America.</i>

29:34.906 --> 29:35.739
[Eric] Oh, yeah.

29:36.674 --> 29:37.508
[Eric] No.

29:43.214 --> 29:44.715
[narrator]
<i>It's a two-hour flight</i>

29:44.749 --> 29:48.051
<i>across this huge wilderness

29:54.359 --> 29:57.427
<i>Any man-made scars
on the land here</i>

29:57.462 --> 30:00.264
<i>could be signs
of the secret military base</i>

30:00.298 --> 30:02.166
<i>that Bruce's father witnessed.</i>

30:07.172 --> 30:08.205
<i>But, out here,</i>

30:08.239 --> 30:11.275
<i>there seems to be
no sign of mankind at all.</i>

30:15.413 --> 30:17.548
<i>Then, Eric spots something.</i>

30:21.219 --> 30:22.219
[Bruce] Yeah, let's...

30:34.365 --> 30:36.333
[Eric] Yeah, it is.
That's pretty interesting.

30:39.037 --> 30:40.037
[Bruce] That is...

30:42.941 --> 30:45.409
[narrator]<i> It looks</i>
<i>like an old man-made clearing.</i>

30:46.678 --> 30:47.978
<i>Could this be evidence</i>

30:48.012 --> 30:50.614
<i>of what was once
secret underground activity?</i>

30:53.585 --> 30:54.585
[Eric] Yeah.

31:02.293 --> 31:04.228
[narrator]<i> And, then,</i>
<i>what looks like</i>

31:04.262 --> 31:05.662
<i>the mark of an old road.</i>

31:11.102 --> 31:13.303
[narrator]<i> There's nothing</i>
<i>on the map in this area,</i>

31:13.305 --> 31:15.272
<i>and there never has been.</i>

31:15.306 --> 31:18.408
<i>The nearest road
is nearly 100 miles away.</i>

31:20.311 --> 31:22.946
<i>But, next, something
even more astonishing.</i>

31:24.849 --> 31:26.750
<i>An overgrown airstrip.</i>

31:28.453 --> 31:31.255
<i>This old airstrip
is unknown even to Eric,</i>

31:31.289 --> 31:33.924
<i>who's been flying
all over the Alaskan bush</i>

<i>for 20 years.</i>

31:48.973 --> 31:50.407
[narrator]
<i>This evidence is new.</i>

31:51.843 --> 31:54.544
<i>It's clear that something,
at some time,</i>

31:54.579 --> 31:55.812
<i>was going on here.</i>

31:58.583 --> 32:01.351
<i>Right in the area given
to Linda Moulton Howe</i>

32:01.386 --> 32:03.520
<i>is the location
of the Dark Pyramid.</i>

32:05.423 --> 32:07.691
I was shocked and pretty psyched

32:07.725 --> 32:10.227
to find these types
of pieces of evidence

32:10.261 --> 32:12.396
<i>that are real evidence.
This is not speculation</i>

32:16.167 --> 32:17.034
[narrator]<i> In fact,</i>

[Bruce]<i> There're some answers</i>

<i>that need to be found

32:25.877 --> 32:27.644

[narrator]<i> The story</i>
<i>of the Dark Pyramid</i>

34:01.406 --> 34:03.940
<i>and there's many, many accounts</i>

34:03.975 --> 34:07.944
<i>of animals just behaving
in the strangest capacity</i>

34:07.979 --> 34:11.281
<i>and without
any logical explanation.</i>

34:11.315 --> 34:13.683
It's truly bizarre.

34:24.429 --> 34:25.929
[narrator]
<i>The wildlife of Alaska</i>

34:25.963 --> 34:27.998
<i>is diverse
and often extraordinary.</i>

34:29.233 --> 34:31.568
<i>Here, the brown bears and moose</i>

34:31.602 --> 34:33.303
<i>are the biggest in the world.</i>

34:33.337 --> 34:35.305
<i>And the behavior
of these animals</i>

34:35.339 --> 34:37.941
<i>is determined
by what's around them.</i>

34:37.975 --> 34:41.878
If there is some kind
of force or energy at work

34:41.913 --> 34:45.148
<i>in this Alaska Triangle,
which it seems there is,</i>

34:45.183 --> 34:47.284
<i>it just makes sense</i>

34:47.318 --> 34:50.353
that this phenomenon
would affect the animals.

34:54.258 --> 34:56.960
[narrator]<i> In June 2015,</i>
<i>in Fairbanks,</i>

34:56.994 --> 34:58.895
<i>right in the middle
of the Triangle,</i>

34:58.930 --> 35:02.999
<i>these strange-looking,
eel-like fish called lampreys</i>

35:03.034 --> 35:04.901
<i>fell on the streets of the city.</i>

35:05.803 --> 35:09.039
These creatures
are vampire fish.

35:09.073 --> 35:12.142
<i>They attach themselves
to the body of other fish</i>

35:12.176 --> 35:14.044
<i>and suck their blood.</i>

35:14.078 --> 35:18.115
Now, they're rarely seen
and hardly ever caught,

35:18.149 --> 35:22.219
and here they are,
falling from the sky.

35:22.253 --> 35:23.453
<i>How can that be?</i>

35:23.488 --> 35:25.722
<i>People must've been
not only mystified,</i>

35:25.756 --> 35:28.024
but terrified.

35:28.059 --> 35:30.460
[narrator]<i> A few months</i>
<i>after this bizarre event,</i>

35:30.495 --> 35:33.563
<i>thousands of dead seabirds
washed up in Whittier,</i>

35:33.598 --> 35:36.266
<i>on Alaska's southern coast.</i>

35:36.300 --> 35:40.337
We started noticing murres,
a seabird, die off.

35:42.807 --> 35:44.174
<i>They did a count out here</i>

35:44.208 --> 35:46.309
and there were at least
hundreds of thousands

35:46.344 --> 35:47.644
dead throughout this area.

35:49.714 --> 35:51.548
They were floating
in the harbor,

35:51.582 --> 35:53.483
they were floating
everywhere here in town.

35:54.852 --> 35:56.353
<i>It was so devastating</i>

35:56.387 --> 35:58.021
<i>because there was
absolutely nothing</i>

35:58.055 --> 35:59.890
you could do to help them.

36:02.393 --> 36:03.894
[narrator]
<i>Around the same time,</i>

36:03.928 --> 36:06.463
<i>there was an even more
mysterious tragedy.</i>

36:07.832 --> 36:10.867
<i>At Afognak,
just above Kodiak Island,</i>

36:10.902 --> 36:14.905
<i>at least ten whales
all died at the same time,</i>

36:14.939 --> 36:17.174
<i>and nobody knows why.</i>

36:17.208 --> 36:20.243
<i>John Moran is
a marine biologist from Juno</i>

36:20.278 --> 36:23.113
<i>who's a specialist
in whale behavior.</i>

36:23.147 --> 36:27.751
We did notice
in the winter of 2014-2015,

36:27.785 --> 36:30.520
<i>herring and krill started
to disappear from our surveys.</i>

36:30.555 --> 36:32.222
<i>We thought
that was a little bit weird,</i>

36:32.256 --> 36:33.623
<i>the whales' behavior was weird.</i>

36:33.658 --> 36:35.959
<i>The spring of 2015,</i>

36:35.993 --> 36:38.028
that's when we started
seeing the dead animals

36:38.062 --> 36:38.929
washing up.

36:38.963 --> 36:40.597
<i>It was...
yeah, kind of a mystery.</i>

36:40.631 --> 36:42.632
We couldn't really figure out
what was going on.

36:44.135 --> 36:46.336
[Chuke]<i> So, there are</i>
<i>these bizarre examples</i>

36:46.370 --> 36:49.739
of animal deaths in Alaska.
I've seen it myself.

36:49.774 --> 36:51.208
We just can't explain it.

36:52.877 --> 36:55.111
<i>It's as if some elemental force</i>

36:55.146 --> 36:56.713
has taken them over.

36:56.747 --> 37:00.784
[narrator]<i> In 2019,</i>
<i>it was the turn of the seals.</i>

37:00.818 --> 37:03.119
<i>Sixty washed up dead.</i>

37:03.154 --> 37:06.790
<i>Bizarrely, some were found
to have lost all their hair.</i>

37:09.160 --> 37:12.095
[Andrew]<i> What's going on?</i>
<i>I mean, it's really weird.</i>

37:12.129 --> 37:14.297
There are
many examples of animals

37:14.332 --> 37:16.733
behaving in strange ways
in Alaska.

37:16.767 --> 37:19.636
<i>I mean, look at this,
this photo I've been sent</i>

37:19.670 --> 37:24.641
<i>of 35,000 walruses gathered
on a beach in western Alaska.</i>

37:24.675 --> 37:28.144
<i>Thirty-five thousand.
That's unheard of!</i>

37:28.179 --> 37:32.182
That's seven times more
than ever been seen before,

37:32.216 --> 37:33.583
all in one place.

37:33.618 --> 37:35.018
I mean, what strange forces

37:35.052 --> 37:36.486
are luring them onto this beach?

37:37.121 --> 37:38.154
We just don't know.

37:39.690 --> 37:42.659
[narrator]<i> For John,</i>
<i>any unusual event in nature</i>

37:42.693 --> 37:44.427
<i>is a sign that something's wrong</i>

37:44.462 --> 37:46.162
<i>and we need to pay attention.</i>

37:46.964 --> 37:48.298
Something happened.

37:48.332 --> 37:50.800
<i>The exact cause, we don't know.</i>

37:50.835 --> 37:52.802
This is a warning
for something coming.

37:55.773 --> 37:58.341
[Andrew]<i> You have to wonder,</i>
<i>what's behind this?</i>

37:58.376 --> 38:00.610
It's totally strange.

38:00.645 --> 38:03.046
<i>Something really odd
is going on here.</i>

38:19.230 --> 38:20.997
[narrator]
<i>The wildlife of Alaska</i>

38:21.032 --> 38:23.500
<i>can be unpredictable
and erratic.</i>

38:23.534 --> 38:27.237
<i>Something out of the ordinary
is affecting animal behavior.</i>

38:29.040 --> 38:30.807
<i>Andrew Gough has a theory</i>

38:30.841 --> 38:32.942
<i>about the unique
Alaska Triangle,</i>

38:32.977 --> 38:35.745
<i>and it's all to do
with electromagnetism.</i>

38:38.015 --> 38:39.783
[Andrew]<i> We know</i>
<i>that there are strange,</i>

38:39.817 --> 38:43.019
unexplained
electromagnetic forces

38:43.054 --> 38:45.522
at play in the Alaska Triangle.

38:45.556 --> 38:48.725
Now, science says
that these forces impact

38:48.759 --> 38:51.161
both human and wildlife.

38:51.195 --> 38:54.230
And, thus, can we conclude,
or at least speculate,

38:54.265 --> 38:57.634
that this truly bizarre
animal behavior

38:57.668 --> 38:59.969
that we're seeing in Alaska
might be due

39:00.004 --> 39:02.305
to these same
electromagnetic forces?

39:05.142 --> 39:06.743
[narrator]
<i>Because of its proximity</i>

39:06.777 --> 39:08.178
<i>to the North Pole,</i>

39:08.212 --> 39:11.815
<i>the electromagnetic field
in Alaska is hugely powerful.</i>

39:13.617 --> 39:16.219
<i>It's the solar wind
coming up against this</i>

39:16.253 --> 39:18.455
<i>that causes the Aurora Borealis.</i>

39:19.557 --> 39:21.524
<i>Could this electromagnetism</i>

39:21.559 --> 39:24.094
<i>be the cause
of strange animal behavior</i>

39:24.128 --> 39:25.462
<i>in the Alaska Triangle?</i>

39:26.731 --> 39:28.698
[Chuke]<i> So, in humans,</i>
<i>we already know</i>

39:28.733 --> 39:30.333
<i>that electromagnetic energy</i>

39:30.368 --> 39:32.602
affects
the central nervous system.

39:32.636 --> 39:33.703
There've been studies

39:33.738 --> 39:35.739
where people have been subjected

39:35.773 --> 39:38.908
to high doses
of electromagnetic radiation

39:38.943 --> 39:40.276
<i>in an MRI,</i>

39:40.310 --> 39:42.746
<i>and it affects them
in a negative way.</i>

39:42.780 --> 39:46.916
<i>It can cause hallucinations,
confusion, anxiety.</i>

39:48.886 --> 39:50.120
[narrator]<i> And, in Alaska,</i>

39:50.154 --> 39:52.722
<i>this electromagnetism
is so strong,</i>

39:52.757 --> 39:54.891
<i>it can have visible effects.</i>

39:55.926 --> 39:58.862
<i>Mike Ricksecker
is a paranormal investigator</i>

39:58.896 --> 40:01.898
<i>who's conducted experiments
using his own body.</i>

40:03.734 --> 40:06.403
Alaska in general
is a very volatile area,

40:06.437 --> 40:09.339
<i>with all the earthquakes,
the volcanos.</i>

40:09.373 --> 40:10.573
<i>You have the proximity</i>

40:10.608 --> 40:13.209
<i>to the North Pole,
magnetic north.</i>

40:13.244 --> 40:14.511
<i>And all this swelling</i>

40:14.545 --> 40:16.880
<i>of the electromagnetic activity,</i>

40:16.914 --> 40:19.349
it is affecting your body.

40:19.383 --> 40:21.151
[narrator]<i> Here,</i>
<i>in the Alaska Triangle,</i>

40:21.218 --> 40:23.553
<i>the strong
electromagnetic forces</i>

40:23.587 --> 40:26.289
<i>flow through Mike's body
to the dowsing rods,</i>

40:26.323 --> 40:29.726
<i>causing them to move
at particular hotspots.</i>

40:29.760 --> 40:32.662
<i>And, if it affects the body,
it affects the mind.</i>

40:34.064 --> 40:35.432
[Mike]<i> That release of energy</i>

40:35.466 --> 40:37.534
can affect people's mood swings,

40:37.601 --> 40:41.404
<i>and could drastically
affect the person.</i>

40:41.439 --> 40:44.407
This location seems
to have a lot of potency.

40:45.609 --> 40:47.277
[narrator]
<i>And, if it affects humans,</i>

40:47.311 --> 40:48.745
<i>why not animals?</i>

40:50.147 --> 40:52.182
It makes sense,
if animals are subjected

40:52.216 --> 40:55.685
to this kind of energy,
that they too could have

40:55.719 --> 40:56.753
some kind of change

40:56.787 --> 40:58.721
in their personality
or behavior.

40:59.623 --> 41:01.191
<i>So, now, the question is,</i>

41:01.225 --> 41:03.526
if there are
these strange forces

41:03.561 --> 41:06.496
affecting animals,
could this, in turn,

41:06.530 --> 41:07.764
be dangerous to humans

41:07.798 --> 41:10.266
when we run into these animals?

41:10.301 --> 41:14.337
[narrator]<i> For Andrew Gough,</i>
<i>the answer is clearly "yes."</i>

41:14.371 --> 41:16.906
[Andrew]
<i>When animals behave weirdly,</i>

41:16.941 --> 41:20.743
<i>it can be a little dangerous
or very dangerous.</i>

41:20.778 --> 41:22.512
And, most certainly,

41:22.546 --> 41:25.248
it's contributing
to the large number

41:25.282 --> 41:28.618
of people who go missing
in the Alaska Triangle.

41:28.652 --> 41:32.355
So, if these forces
are having an impact

41:32.389 --> 41:34.257
on the minds of animals,

41:34.291 --> 41:36.993
then, not only there's
nothing we can do about it,

41:37.027 --> 41:39.462
but just be prepared for it.

41:41.632 --> 41:43.900
[narrator]<i> Whatever</i>
<i>strange forces are at work,</i>

41:43.934 --> 41:46.636
<i>the animals themselves
are bearing the brunt.</i>

41:48.205 --> 41:51.007
<i>It's as if the mysteries
of the Alaska Triangle</i>

41:51.041 --> 41:52.509
<i>go beyond nature.</i>

41:54.812 --> 41:55.812
<i>Perhaps that's why</i>

41:55.846 --> 41:59.282
<i>it's such a special,
if hazardous, place.</i>
