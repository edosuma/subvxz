00:28.896 --> 00:31.432
<i>Laughter is a sin around here.</i>

00:31.532 --> 00:35.003
<i>You know why? Because laughter
can mean happiness</i>

00:35.103 --> 00:37.839
<i>and I want you boys to always know</i>

00:37.939 --> 00:42.968
<i>happiness don't exist for you.</i>

00:44.012 --> 00:47.106
<i>It exists for the privileged,
for the loved.</i>

00:48.417 --> 00:52.479
<i>The world outside don't care about you!</i>

00:53.388 --> 00:55.557
<i>So laughing is just pretending.</i>

00:55.657 --> 00:57.792
<i>And if they make believe over here, uh-uh.</i>

00:57.892 --> 01:02.516
<i>This here is a home for the wayward,
for the orphaned, for the discarded.</i>

01:04.099 --> 01:07.727
<i>I am setting you up to succeed.</i>

01:09.204 --> 01:11.540
<i>Because y'all too stupid
to know the truth.</i>

01:11.640 --> 01:14.843
<i>And you'll thank me for this
when you get old enough, okay?</i>

01:14.943 --> 01:19.314
<i>Believe me, you'll thank me
for telling you the truth.</i>

01:24.653 --> 01:28.959
My hates have a tendency
to move around, you know?

01:29.059 --> 01:33.196
I hate that I'm losing this game of cards.
I hate you asking me questions.

01:33.296 --> 01:35.531
Frank Stone?

01:35.631 --> 01:38.101
I neither hate him nor like him.

01:38.201 --> 01:40.937
I'm a professional headmaster.

01:41.037 --> 01:42.438
I'm objective.

01:42.538 --> 01:45.841
I'm not a homosexual. I'm a pedophile.

01:45.941 --> 01:49.579
It's different, okay?

01:49.679 --> 01:52.306
I teach them boys who they are.

01:52.982 --> 01:55.576
So society wants to kill it.

01:57.287 --> 02:01.524
These boys up here, who do they got?
Ain't nobody, just each other, just boys.

02:01.624 --> 02:05.428
They gotta learn how to love each other.
So I teach 'em how.

02:06.663 --> 02:10.091
I don't mess with old men. I'm married.

02:11.335 --> 02:13.637
It's degenerate.

02:13.737 --> 02:16.161
Outside the bounds.
He's on the other side of the street.

02:16.261 --> 02:20.311
I'm walking down the street, right?
Right street. He's across the street.

02:20.411 --> 02:22.503
Always has been.

02:29.686 --> 02:32.373
Working for the mob.
Who does he think he is, Al Capone?

04:13.393 --> 04:15.820
No, no!

04:17.397 --> 04:19.866
No, no!

04:20.166 --> 04:22.302
Knock it off.

04:22.702 --> 04:25.070
I said knock it off.

04:29.909 --> 04:32.203
I got it open.

04:33.780 --> 04:36.075
Get the merchandise.

04:53.501 --> 04:55.470
Slow down.

04:55.570 --> 04:58.497
You can get the cops on a day off.

05:12.487 --> 05:14.670
Listen to me, you stupid jerk-off.

05:14.770 --> 05:17.876
You're not my boss,
so don't talk to me like that.

05:18.026 --> 05:21.864
If I want to get some action off some
broad, I will, okay? That's my business.

05:21.964 --> 05:26.268
I thought you acted inappropriately.
Were you tryin' to get us popped for rape?

05:26.368 --> 05:29.226
- Next time, I'll just fuckin' kill...
- Whoa!

05:35.260 --> 05:37.529
You should have kept
a better class of friend.

06:20.957 --> 06:22.959
<i>I see the frustration of sin!</i>

06:23.059 --> 06:27.497
<i>I feel the frustration of sin.</i>

06:27.897 --> 06:30.568
<i>Let me tell you,
if you don't already know.</i>

06:30.668 --> 06:33.971
<i>Sin is the apple that's put
in front of the horse.</i>

06:34.071 --> 06:38.241
<i>It was the apple presented to Eve
in the garden of Eden.</i>

06:38.341 --> 06:43.414
<i>And it's the apple of my eye when I see
that nice little rump on all of you.</i>

06:43.514 --> 06:45.949
<i>It's mine to take!</i>

06:46.049 --> 06:50.120
<i>I'm headmaster. That's, like, God.</i>

06:50.220 --> 06:54.158
<i>That's, like, the final say, okay?</i>

06:54.992 --> 06:59.663
<i>I take, I give, my surrender.</i>

06:59.963 --> 07:02.333
<i>But make no mistake!</i>

07:02.633 --> 07:05.803
<i>It's still me and not you.</i>

07:05.903 --> 07:08.840
<i>None of you have a claim or say.</i>

07:08.940 --> 07:11.376
<i>I am the last word.</i>

07:11.476 --> 07:13.369
<i>Okay?</i>

07:48.180 --> 07:50.150
- <i>Hey, Frank?</i>
- Yeah.

07:50.250 --> 07:53.810
<i>The boss wants
to see you tomorrow. Understand?</i>

08:23.049 --> 08:25.551
- Let's not talk about it.
- Hooked on that shit?

08:25.651 --> 08:29.222
- It's in their veins.
- That's like that energy drink, right?

08:29.322 --> 08:31.992
It's their methedrine, their methedrine.

08:32.092 --> 08:35.529
- The first energy drink ever.
- Their first guy's talking shit all the time.

08:35.629 --> 08:38.465
- Hey, bud, are you in?
- Hey, Frank, how're you doing?

08:38.565 --> 08:40.967
Sit down, sit down.

08:41.067 --> 08:43.160
What do you have for me?

08:46.907 --> 08:49.134
A pretty nice haul.

08:49.576 --> 08:51.436
Whoa!

08:58.551 --> 09:00.246
Nice.

09:00.788 --> 09:02.748
Real nice.

09:03.374 --> 09:04.992
Clean job as always?

09:05.092 --> 09:09.063
A couple of bumps on the road,
but I paved them over, as always.

09:09.163 --> 09:13.267
Yeah, I heard. You know, you're one
coldhearted son of a bitch, Frank.

09:13.367 --> 09:15.169
Took out his own guy.

09:15.269 --> 09:18.742
You know, you remind me of this...

09:18.842 --> 09:23.210
this bedtime story that my father,
God bless his soul,

09:23.310 --> 09:24.779
that he used to read to me as a kid.

09:24.879 --> 09:29.083
It was about an evil bastard,
just like Frank. I'm tellin' ya.

09:29.183 --> 09:31.986
Frank, did your father ever used
to read you bedtime stories?

09:35.222 --> 09:37.860
I never knew my ol' man, Tony.

09:37.960 --> 09:41.496
Oh, I'm sorry, Frank, I didn't know.
I didn't know, Frank.

09:41.596 --> 09:43.790
Give him his money.

09:45.367 --> 09:47.427
The money!

09:48.036 --> 09:51.575
Okay, Frank, here's your money.

09:52.908 --> 09:54.376
Thanks, Tony.

09:54.476 --> 09:56.544
Hey, Frank, I got a question for you.

09:56.644 --> 09:59.347
Now that you got all those
fazool's in your pocket,

09:59.447 --> 10:02.750
which one of your broad's
you gonna take out?

10:04.486 --> 10:06.889
Maybe take a shower...

10:07.889 --> 10:10.547
Take her to Paris,
some place more high end, romantic

10:10.647 --> 10:13.354
like Coney Island for a hot date.

10:15.599 --> 10:18.267
Did you need anything else, Tony?

10:18.367 --> 10:21.968
No, that's it. Thanks, Frank.
Good work, good work.

10:24.040 --> 10:28.825
- Have a nice day, fellas.
- Yeah, take it easy, handsome.

10:29.513 --> 10:32.081
What you guys break his balls for?
He's a fern.

10:32.181 --> 10:35.218
Alright, come on, let's play cards.
Come on, come on, come on.

11:27.204 --> 11:29.941
Long, long time ago...

11:30.541 --> 11:32.803
Long time ago!

11:33.912 --> 11:36.848
You know, man figured out...

11:37.348 --> 11:41.519
Animal skin, beneficial to 'em.

11:41.619 --> 11:43.421
Good thing.

11:43.521 --> 11:49.360
Now, like this here,
keep ya warm in the winter.

11:49.460 --> 11:52.230
Dry in the summer. My happy thing.

11:52.330 --> 11:54.424
Animal skin.

11:58.069 --> 12:00.372
Like this belt here, see?

12:00.772 --> 12:02.941
It's leather, animal skin.

12:03.041 --> 12:06.483
But there's many different functions.
There's holding my pants, you know?

12:08.413 --> 12:10.941
Tie a woman down and shoot.

12:11.818 --> 12:15.611
Be a good thing, too, sometimes.
Depends on the girl.

12:15.711 --> 12:18.190
Those women are hard to...

12:18.490 --> 12:22.419
hard to figure them out
sometimes, you know?

12:23.662 --> 12:25.623
It's romantic.

12:27.700 --> 12:30.036
Hit 'em for the punishment and...

12:30.136 --> 12:34.146
You know, wrap it around your hand
like this or on your fist like this.

12:35.174 --> 12:38.778
Bam! No more problem.

12:38.878 --> 12:41.213
That man go down.

12:41.613 --> 12:43.840
It's going down!

12:51.274 --> 12:53.510
Turn around, now.

12:53.610 --> 12:55.670
Turn around!

13:01.618 --> 13:03.878
Grab your ankles.

13:07.457 --> 13:09.693
But you don't listen.

13:09.793 --> 13:13.997
Now I'm gonna fix your radio,
I'll teach ya.

13:14.297 --> 13:17.401
I'm using this belt as... alright?

13:17.701 --> 13:20.429
And this is a romantic use for it.

13:41.826 --> 13:44.432
Some place this was.

13:45.013 --> 13:47.349
It's a good thing they closed it.

13:47.999 --> 13:50.293
It was horribly run.

13:53.137 --> 13:56.975
Those poor boys,
they use them like punching bags.

13:57.075 --> 14:00.135
That's what... that's what I heard.

14:02.648 --> 14:04.750
It's a good thing we didn't go there, huh?

14:40.220 --> 14:44.458
Hey, you better hurry up.
Class starts in a few minutes.

14:45.058 --> 14:46.860
What?

14:47.460 --> 14:51.222
Oh, I thought you were
in my creative writing class.

14:53.116 --> 14:54.810
Sorry.

15:06.596 --> 15:08.181
Dominic was loaded, as usual.

15:08.281 --> 15:11.751
He loved to drink, which was a good thing
because at this point, he had to drink.

15:11.851 --> 15:14.641
If he didn't start his day by rolling out
of bed and crawling to the freezer

15:14.741 --> 15:17.823
for a few shots of vodka, his hands
would shake and he'd start to feel sick.

15:17.923 --> 15:19.761
And he'd become as manic
as a mental patient.

15:19.861 --> 15:22.895
But what are you gonna do?
Everybody's got their cross...

15:29.570 --> 15:32.840
Dominic was a drunk and would always
be a drunk, but he was okay with that.

15:32.940 --> 15:35.577
He was the heartbreakingly tragic figure
he always wanted to be,

15:35.677 --> 15:39.543
but with an abdominal sense of human that
made him borderline heroic in his own mind.

15:39.643 --> 15:43.517
He was destined to crash and burn. But
it was gonna be epic, if not entertaining.

15:43.617 --> 15:45.552
He had already come
close to cashing in once.

15:45.652 --> 15:49.055
Couple of winters back, he was found passed
out in his boxer shorts in the boulevard

15:49.155 --> 15:51.225
during a failed attempt
to get to a liquor store.

15:51.325 --> 15:53.627
He spent the next five weeks
in the hospital.

15:53.727 --> 15:57.465
Initially, the doctors didn't give him much
of a chance. Dominic's liver was shot.

15:57.565 --> 16:00.599
He was completely yellow with jaundice.
His skin was yellow.

16:00.699 --> 16:04.106
The whites of his eyes were yellow, if he
had been wearing a top hat and a monocle,

16:04.206 --> 16:07.009
he could've passed for Mr. Peanut,
but somehow he survived.

16:07.109 --> 16:10.212
Supposedly, the liver is a highly
regenerative organ, or so they told him.

16:10.312 --> 16:13.522
The doctors lectured Dominic about how
he was being given a second chance to live

16:13.622 --> 16:15.433
and how he needed to make
some serious lifestyle changes...

16:15.533 --> 16:18.454
Alright, thank you, thank you, Bradford.

16:19.121 --> 16:23.025
Anybody have any questions
for Bradford, class?

16:23.125 --> 16:27.162
- Yes, Ackley?
- It didn't do anything for me.

16:27.262 --> 16:30.398
- Okay, okay...
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

16:30.498 --> 16:34.403
- If that's what you felt, that's okay.
- Didn't do, yeah, I'm sorry.

16:34.503 --> 16:36.872
- Okay, no, if that's how you felt...
- Just...

16:36.972 --> 16:41.969
Yeah, I just feel like
it just lacked emotion.

16:42.778 --> 16:45.245
- Yes, Jackie?
- I have something, Mr. Benson.

16:45.345 --> 16:48.985
- Okay, Jackie, go ahead.
- Okay.

16:49.785 --> 16:51.679
Alright.

16:53.022 --> 16:58.307
- Alright, Jackie, go ahead.
- Okay, okay. Sorry, okay.

16:59.495 --> 17:03.232
He never stayed long. Never.
He liked Rosemary's company,

17:03.332 --> 17:06.832
but always seemed to be in a hurry,
like if he had a duel life or something.

17:06.932 --> 17:09.637
But Rosemary didn't mind. She was lonely.

17:09.738 --> 17:13.377
And lonely women cry at night.
Rosemary got sick of it.

17:13.477 --> 17:17.247
That's why she wore her fancy bottle
of perfume and best dress.

17:17.347 --> 17:19.949
She wanted him to caress her
like a mink coat.

17:20.049 --> 17:24.387
But it didn't happen this time.
Rosemary wept after he left.

17:24.488 --> 17:28.358
She thought about swallowing that whole
bottle of pills, but decided not to.

17:28.458 --> 17:32.228
She didn't want any man thinking
someone killed themselves for him.

17:32.328 --> 17:35.535
Rosemary, instead, painted
a horizon on a canvas.

17:35.865 --> 17:38.860
It seemed brighter than her future.

17:41.438 --> 17:46.194
- You alright, Jackie?
- Yeah, no, I just get nervous sometimes.

17:46.294 --> 17:48.812
Okay, what do you call this story?

17:48.912 --> 17:53.577
Oh, God. I guess I would call it...

17:54.477 --> 17:57.022
"The girl in apartment 3J".

17:57.122 --> 18:00.983
Alright, does anybody have
any questions for Jackie?

18:02.460 --> 18:05.396
- Yes, Ackley?
- Yes, I was wondering how long

18:05.496 --> 18:08.899
we're gonna have to hear about
these desperate characters of yours.

18:08.999 --> 18:12.570
The same characters from
the last story that you brought in.

18:12.670 --> 18:15.673
I mean, when are we gonna hear
something good for a change, something...

18:15.773 --> 18:18.409
- What?
- ...with more levels.

18:18.509 --> 18:20.979
More... I want more... I want more.

18:21.079 --> 18:23.248
I'm so sorry, Mr. Herman Melville.

18:23.348 --> 18:26.251
I wouldn't be caught dead
reading Melville.

18:26.351 --> 18:29.955
Excuse me, Ackley?
Ackley, we could do without that.

18:30.055 --> 18:33.959
Well, the whole function
of this creative writing class

18:34.059 --> 18:38.597
is to learn and experience and to grow.

18:38.697 --> 18:40.099
I... yeah, I...

18:40.199 --> 18:44.570
We do not need to criticize
to the extent that you take it to.

18:44.670 --> 18:46.901
- Oh...
- Jackie? What do you...

18:47.001 --> 18:51.010
What were you feeling when you wrote
this particular passage to your story?

18:51.110 --> 18:55.547
"The lonely girl in apartment 3F."

18:55.647 --> 19:00.319
No, it was "The girl in apartment 3J".

19:00.819 --> 19:05.058
But I like that.
"The lonely girl in apartment 3F."

19:05.158 --> 19:08.928
But, she's afraid of being an old maid

19:09.028 --> 19:11.231
and all her friends are wondering...

19:11.331 --> 19:13.666
Okay, Jackie, thank you, thank you.

19:13.766 --> 19:17.504
Does anybody else have
anything they'd like to read?

19:17.604 --> 19:19.363
No?

19:19.772 --> 19:21.200
- I would like to read...
- Yes, Ackley?

19:21.300 --> 19:23.710
I would like to read
my piece for the class.

19:23.810 --> 19:26.946
- Can you make it quick?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, sure, sure.

19:27.046 --> 19:31.385
So, this is an ongoing...
this is part of a trilogy.

19:31.485 --> 19:34.387
I'm... you speak of one and...

19:34.687 --> 19:38.032
Okay, alright, class dismissed!

19:55.076 --> 19:57.111
<i>Frank!</i>

19:58.011 --> 20:00.080
<i>Frank!</i>

20:01.394 --> 20:03.851
<i>Frank! You listening to me?</i>

20:03.951 --> 20:06.087
<i>I know you hear me.</i>

20:06.187 --> 20:08.522
<i>I know you hear me.</i>

21:10.420 --> 21:14.290
There are certain things in life.

21:14.890 --> 21:17.760
There are certain things that are
passed down in life, you know?

21:17.860 --> 21:20.387
Like father and son.

21:21.397 --> 21:23.724
In our case...

21:26.869 --> 21:29.196
headmaster to a...

21:34.527 --> 21:36.353
Orphan.

21:38.549 --> 21:40.412
Like...

21:41.446 --> 21:45.622
Like... the love of huntin'.
Yeah, killin'!

21:46.122 --> 21:48.985
That was a good one. That was a good one.

21:50.561 --> 21:54.888
Fishin'? Fishin'? Yeah, fishin' will work.

21:56.233 --> 22:00.704
Yep, today, though,
I'm gonna do some new tradition.

22:00.804 --> 22:05.342
From a long line of traditions
between a headmaster and orphan.

22:05.442 --> 22:08.779
That's called sharing a bottle of bourbon.

22:08.879 --> 22:13.041
It's good. Good for ya.

22:14.017 --> 22:16.020
It's good, you know, I mean...

22:16.120 --> 22:18.923
Take your mind off of things that...

22:19.223 --> 22:23.265
You know, get your mind
off of things that...

22:23.865 --> 22:25.710
bother ya.

22:26.564 --> 22:28.733
About yourself and stuff.

22:28.833 --> 22:31.160
Purify your soul!

22:32.337 --> 22:34.463
Got one.

22:34.806 --> 22:38.819
What do you think them priests be doing
in church with their wine? Drunk.

22:44.782 --> 22:46.851
Want a taste?

22:46.951 --> 22:49.779
Here, here, have a taste.

22:51.456 --> 22:55.419
I said to... to have a taste.

22:56.395 --> 22:58.258
Here...

22:58.358 --> 23:00.203
go on.

23:02.835 --> 23:06.439
There you go. Not too strong, huh?

23:06.539 --> 23:10.643
Too strong?
Whoa, hey, that's enough there.

23:10.743 --> 23:12.945
Come on, give it back.

23:13.045 --> 23:17.500
Give it back, it's mine.
It's mine, give it back!

23:20.686 --> 23:23.021
It's a gift.

23:23.121 --> 23:26.316
It's a gift to you, it's mine.

23:39.022 --> 23:41.458
Take your pants off.

24:04.129 --> 24:06.232
Yes, may I help you?

24:06.332 --> 24:09.514
I would like to take
your creative writing class.

24:10.738 --> 24:12.540
Great.

24:12.640 --> 24:14.699
Have a seat.

24:17.111 --> 24:18.838
Thanks.

24:20.080 --> 24:23.414
Is there any particular reason you'd like
to join my creative writing class?

24:23.514 --> 24:25.052
No.

24:25.152 --> 24:28.289
- Have you ever written anything before?
- No.

24:28.389 --> 24:32.618
Nothing? No poetry or news articles?

24:34.562 --> 24:37.557
Okay, name?

24:40.535 --> 24:42.202
Oscar.

24:42.302 --> 24:44.004
Oscar.

24:44.104 --> 24:46.975
- Kissel.
- Okay.

24:47.075 --> 24:48.902
Oscar.

24:50.579 --> 24:53.429
A lot of people have come
in here like yourself that...

24:53.529 --> 24:56.585
they have a lot to express
and they don't know how.

24:56.685 --> 24:59.522
Creative writing will help you
with all of that.

25:00.522 --> 25:03.460
I'm gonna give you an assignment.
I want you to go home...

25:03.560 --> 25:07.261
and write about something
you know or like,

25:07.361 --> 25:09.819
but make it fictitious.

25:10.698 --> 25:14.936
If you like flying on planes,
write a story about an airline pilot.

25:15.036 --> 25:18.273
Or if you like walking
in the park on Sundays,

25:18.373 --> 25:22.711
write a story about a softball player
that does well in that park on Sundays.

25:22.811 --> 25:27.417
Whatever it is, do it thoroughly.
Get into details.

25:27.517 --> 25:31.521
I want you to make our class believe
in your character, that it's real.

25:31.621 --> 25:35.516
And then we'll feel for them
in their problems, okay?

25:36.859 --> 25:38.361
Softball player?

26:27.244 --> 26:28.980
<i>Goddammit, Frank!</i>

26:29.880 --> 26:32.527
<i>Didn't that sweet ass you got
for a creative writing teacher</i>

26:32.627 --> 26:35.018
<i>tell you to write about stuff you know?</i>

26:35.118 --> 26:40.224
<i>Well, you know about
the darker things in life, don't ya?</i>

26:40.324 --> 26:42.818
<i>So write about that!</i>

26:45.296 --> 26:47.098
<i>Now get back on that typewriter.</i>

26:47.198 --> 26:51.127
<i>And write about that,
you mangy looking bastard.</i>

26:53.272 --> 26:56.608
<i>Come on, I learned you better than that!</i>

26:57.208 --> 26:59.035
<i>Go.</i>

27:42.655 --> 27:46.126
The night never knew
a shade darker than his soul.

27:46.726 --> 27:49.829
That's what everybody used
to say about Frank Stone.

27:49.929 --> 27:53.666
Like a clap of thunder,
he was brought into the world,

27:53.766 --> 27:57.462
and like a flash of lightning, he lived.

27:58.538 --> 28:02.150
And that was pulling off jewelry jobs.

28:03.409 --> 28:07.889
It was his vice.
It gave him comfort, control.

28:09.382 --> 28:12.839
And he would stop at nothing
to get it done.

28:13.386 --> 28:18.301
Nothing. He was as serious
as a heart attack.

28:38.780 --> 28:43.382
But how can one live when laughter
can't sooth their soul?

28:44.251 --> 28:47.980
Frank knew he was dead inside, born dead.

28:50.424 --> 28:52.927
Didn't understand why.

28:53.027 --> 28:55.129
Only certain things made sense to him.

28:55.229 --> 28:57.398
Like being found in a dumpster
on Christmas Eve,

28:57.498 --> 29:00.521
with the umbilical cord
wrapped around his neck.

29:00.935 --> 29:02.761
No.

29:03.570 --> 29:05.598
That can't be good.

29:07.241 --> 29:12.139
That was clear. That's exactly
what the syndicate looks for, too.

29:12.314 --> 29:13.982
Men with rage.

29:14.082 --> 29:17.069
Frank was the most comfortable
in this kind of environment.

29:17.169 --> 29:19.922
So was his boss, Tough Tony Forte.

29:20.022 --> 29:22.758
A local punk gangster with a long arm...

29:22.858 --> 29:27.162
Who always gave Frank work...
whenever the need would arise.

29:27.262 --> 29:31.399
And fortunately for Frank, that need
came about on a regular basis.

29:31.499 --> 29:33.869
He couldn't wait to get that call.

29:33.969 --> 29:37.205
It's the only time
Frank seemed to come alive.

29:37.305 --> 29:42.409
That was just the way things
were in his world. Hard, cold.

29:42.510 --> 29:44.880
That was Frank Stone.

29:44.980 --> 29:47.382
That's all I got so far.

29:47.482 --> 29:50.244
Thank you, Oscar, that was interesting.

29:51.720 --> 29:55.683
Does anybody here
have any questions for Oscar?

29:57.994 --> 29:59.763
Yes, Ackley?

29:59.863 --> 30:02.465
I'm sorry, but that sounded like a...

30:02.565 --> 30:05.702
gangster movie
from the 1940's or something.

30:05.802 --> 30:08.772
You know,
it was like just so totally fake.

30:08.872 --> 30:12.341
And, like, no one in real life
sounds like Frank Stone.

30:12.441 --> 30:15.044
Except, since World War II or something.

30:15.144 --> 30:20.483
Philip... Ackley, once again,
we are not here to judge.

30:20.583 --> 30:23.677
We're here to analyze and interpret.

30:25.688 --> 30:28.726
Does anybody else
have any questions for Oscar?

30:28.826 --> 30:30.985
Yes, Jackie.

30:31.461 --> 30:36.091
Well, I thought it was good.
I really liked it.

30:36.901 --> 30:39.536
It reminded me of one
of those crime novels.

30:39.636 --> 30:42.506
You know what I'm talking about?
Like they sell in the bus depots.

30:42.606 --> 30:46.621
You know, those things that they're
supposed to take your mind off the journey

30:46.721 --> 30:49.613
you're about to go on... you know.

30:49.713 --> 30:54.618
I love those things. I was once on this
bus trip from Virginia to New Mexico...

30:54.718 --> 30:57.888
Yes, yeah, thank you. Thank you, Jackie.

30:57.988 --> 31:00.916
Does anybody else
have any questions for Oscar?

31:02.392 --> 31:05.488
Okay, if... well, class dismissed.

31:22.914 --> 31:24.950
- <i>Hey, Frank?
</i>- Yeah?

31:25.050 --> 31:27.944
<i>You can go ahead with that operation.</i>

31:32.924 --> 31:36.661
The Grobe brothers.
Vic and Ronnie, I presume.

31:36.761 --> 31:39.931
We're here. Start talking.

31:40.031 --> 31:43.727
I like your manners. Sit down.

31:48.540 --> 31:51.678
This job we're gonna pull
is in the diamond district.

31:52.178 --> 31:55.481
This place is an upstairs distribution.

31:55.781 --> 31:58.885
The way it works,
you guys got to "go-between".

31:58.985 --> 32:01.453
He carries the diamonds down
in a little briefcase.

32:01.553 --> 32:04.423
He doesn't take the elevator,
he uses the stairs.

32:04.523 --> 32:08.227
It's Bonafide, I checked it out.
That's what will make it happen.

32:08.627 --> 32:12.629
- How many stones will he be carrying?
- 150K, minimum.

32:13.565 --> 32:18.195
- What's our cut?
- It's a flat rate. Twenty-five grand each.

32:19.505 --> 32:21.741
Twenty-five?

32:21.841 --> 32:24.274
What are you, crazy or something?

32:24.544 --> 32:27.514
We split it three ways
or we ain't interested.

32:27.614 --> 32:29.983
Look, these diamonds, they're rare.

32:30.083 --> 32:32.452
No fence in New York
is gonna deal with them.

32:32.552 --> 32:35.806
All you need to know is
it's gonna take time and money.

32:35.906 --> 32:39.434
And that's the rate, 25k.

32:42.429 --> 32:44.164
Nah.

32:44.264 --> 32:46.233
Split it three ways or nothing.

32:46.333 --> 32:48.602
Nothing it is.

32:49.002 --> 32:51.839
You know, I was told
you guys were professionals.

32:51.939 --> 32:54.532
I guess I was told wrong.

32:57.578 --> 32:59.372
Sit.

33:08.389 --> 33:11.826
- Does that mean you're in?
- Yeah.

33:11.926 --> 33:15.529
- Alright, you got any other questions?
- Yeah, I got one question.

33:15.629 --> 33:18.232
Me and my brother, we heard
a couple of things about you.

33:18.332 --> 33:20.969
We need you to clear it up for us.

33:21.069 --> 33:25.574
- You heard some things like what?
- That whoever works these jobs of yours...

33:26.174 --> 33:28.734
they never get seen again.

33:30.044 --> 33:32.613
Let me tell you something, fellas.

33:32.713 --> 33:37.252
People talk all the time,
they talk for a lot of reasons.

33:37.352 --> 33:40.956
Envy, jealousy, greed.

33:41.056 --> 33:45.761
All you need to know is if you're square
with me, I'll be square with you.

33:46.261 --> 33:48.555
I'll be in touch.

34:05.680 --> 34:08.483
- Hi!
- How you doing?

34:08.583 --> 34:11.821
You're new here. I'm Jackie.

34:12.721 --> 34:15.225
Well, actually,
we met the other day, kind of.

34:15.324 --> 34:17.960
Yeah, what's yours again?

34:18.061 --> 34:21.156
- What?
- Your name, dumb-dumb.

34:22.532 --> 34:25.702
Oscar. Oscar Kissell.

34:26.168 --> 34:30.206
So, like, what are you hoping to be?
A mystery writer or something?

34:30.806 --> 34:32.809
I don't know.

34:32.909 --> 34:35.545
Oh, my God, is that typed?

34:35.645 --> 34:37.380
Do you...

34:37.480 --> 34:41.016
You used the typewriter. I didn't
even know they were around anymore.

34:41.117 --> 34:45.456
- I like typewriters. I mean, I like things...
- Hey, what's that? Oh!

34:47.790 --> 34:49.592
Gotcha.

34:50.092 --> 34:53.764
Okay, class, everybody take their seats.

34:53.864 --> 34:55.956
We're gonna start.

35:00.604 --> 35:03.089
<i>Monday, late afternoon.</i>

35:04.675 --> 35:06.710
<i>Diamond district.</i>

35:06.810 --> 35:10.639
<i>And Frank Stone gets ready.</i>

35:14.818 --> 35:17.479
<i>A large Romanian man...</i>

35:17.579 --> 35:19.810
<i>comes out of an office...</i>

35:20.524 --> 35:25.129
with a briefcase full of bling.

35:25.229 --> 35:28.817
<i>But, today, that large Romanian...</i>

35:28.917 --> 35:32.091
<i>gonna be in for a surprise.</i>

35:40.545 --> 35:42.981
You two midgets think you can rob me?

35:43.081 --> 35:45.208
Try it.

35:57.061 --> 35:59.998
- Jesus Christ, there's a fortune in here!
- Nice!

36:00.098 --> 36:02.792
Grab the bag, let's get out of here.

36:06.438 --> 36:08.674
I think there's only enough
for me and my brother.

36:08.774 --> 36:11.502
- What?
- You heard me, you dirty double...

36:13.779 --> 36:16.549
<i>It's called the double-cross.</i>

36:16.649 --> 36:19.243
<i>Or the dirty double-cross.</i>

36:19.885 --> 36:25.058
Someone turning on you is one of the
unfortunate hazards in this line of work.

36:25.158 --> 36:29.629
Luckily for Frank,
he's always expecting it.

36:30.029 --> 36:32.522
Wow, that's interesting.

36:33.532 --> 36:38.929
It really is getting more and more
cohesive, Oscar. Keep it up.

36:52.118 --> 36:55.747
Hey! Hey, Oscar!

36:56.590 --> 36:58.483
Hey!

37:02.062 --> 37:05.657
Well, I was just wondering
if you wanted to get a coffee?

37:06.500 --> 37:11.630
So, I just wanted to know
what goes on in that head of yours.

37:13.173 --> 37:14.541
What do you mean?

37:14.641 --> 37:19.015
Well, how do you get
your stuff to sound so real?

37:19.115 --> 37:23.050
Like... I don't know, I just...

37:23.150 --> 37:27.147
I feel like I'm in the same world
as your characters.

37:27.247 --> 37:30.225
Like... It's...

37:30.325 --> 37:34.386
I don't know. I just write
whatever comes into my head.

37:36.764 --> 37:41.761
Wow, I mean, Frank Stone is so cold.

37:42.261 --> 37:44.605
Well, I mean...

37:44.705 --> 37:48.000
He has a lot of demons in his past.

37:49.043 --> 37:52.104
They're gonna stay there
until he gets rid of 'em.

37:53.798 --> 37:55.991
He doesn't trust anyone.

37:57.218 --> 37:59.645
That's how he survives.

38:02.324 --> 38:05.779
Have you always had
this kind of imagination?

38:05.879 --> 38:08.964
Did you read those recommended books
the teacher told us about?

38:09.064 --> 38:11.433
I didn't read anything.

38:11.833 --> 38:13.969
You're so serious!

38:14.069 --> 38:18.465
But you're modest, too.
Can you pass me the sugar?

38:21.109 --> 38:22.569
Boo!

38:23.912 --> 38:26.206
Oh, sorry.

38:35.424 --> 38:38.585
Thanks for giving me a ride home, Oscar.

38:39.362 --> 38:41.689
That was nice.

38:43.132 --> 38:44.926
Well...

38:46.102 --> 38:51.598
When did you start dressing
like a little tugboat captain?

38:55.011 --> 38:58.673
You know, do you like the open sea?

39:01.984 --> 39:03.553
Hello?

39:03.653 --> 39:07.289
Yeah, you... you don't give that much.

39:07.389 --> 39:10.017
You really don't talk that much.

39:19.937 --> 39:21.071
Are you hungry?

39:21.171 --> 39:25.125
Why don't you come upstairs and let me
make you a fluffernutter sandwich.

39:25.976 --> 39:27.645
Have you ever had one?

39:27.745 --> 39:32.080
I can tell you haven't had one, cause
your eyes didn't light up when I said it.

39:33.984 --> 39:35.911
You're missing out.

39:39.289 --> 39:41.158
Do you want a beer?

39:41.258 --> 39:44.127
No thanks. I don't drink.

39:44.227 --> 39:46.488
You don't drink?

39:49.032 --> 39:52.803
What are you, a boy scout or something?
How about a glass of milk?

39:52.903 --> 39:55.131
That sounds good.

40:03.214 --> 40:05.271
Here you go.

40:10.054 --> 40:12.524
What's the matter, Oscar?

40:12.924 --> 40:17.061
I don't know.
Something strange just happened.

40:17.161 --> 40:18.964
What?

40:19.464 --> 40:21.600
The horse on the glass here...

40:21.700 --> 40:25.761
reminded me of something that
happened to me when I was a kid.

40:26.971 --> 40:30.242
You know, I was raised in an orphanage.

40:30.842 --> 40:34.447
And one day, me and all the other boys

40:34.547 --> 40:37.450
we were all taken on a field trip.

40:37.650 --> 40:40.375
But when the bus got there...

40:40.475 --> 40:42.988
the first thing that I saw...

40:43.088 --> 40:46.326
was this beautiful gray horse.

40:46.826 --> 40:49.061
So I approached the horse really slowly

40:49.161 --> 40:54.758
and I was talking to him softly,
the way a kid would.

40:55.401 --> 40:58.170
And all of a sudden,
the horse, he went nuts.

40:58.270 --> 41:00.272
I mean, he went totally haywire.

41:00.372 --> 41:03.947
Started jumping up on his hind legs...

41:04.047 --> 41:05.395
kicking.

41:05.495 --> 41:09.921
He broke free from the chain
and he started to scare the other horses.

41:10.021 --> 41:13.954
Well, horses do weird things
like that sometimes.

41:14.254 --> 41:17.658
Yeah, well, the headmaster,
he got so angry...

41:17.758 --> 41:20.761
that he grabbed me
and he started to beat me publicly,

41:20.911 --> 41:23.079
right in front of the other boys.

41:23.179 --> 41:26.082
That headmaster sounds like such a jerk!

41:26.332 --> 41:29.907
And after that, all the kids,
they laughed at me.

41:30.236 --> 41:34.340
They humiliated me, mocked me.

41:34.440 --> 41:36.977
And I'll tell you that headmaster...

41:37.577 --> 41:39.580
after that,
he never missed an opportunity...

41:39.680 --> 41:43.279
Let's change the subject,
talk about something else.

41:57.164 --> 41:59.166
Hey, Oscar?

42:04.105 --> 42:06.474
- Isn't it funny?
- I'm leaving.

42:06.574 --> 42:08.776
Oh, come on. What's the matter with you?

42:08.876 --> 42:14.213
Listen, you may think everything is a joke.
But me, I take everything seriously.

42:14.313 --> 42:18.319
- And I don't appreciate you mocking me.
- I wasn't mocking you.

42:18.419 --> 42:22.148
What's the matter with you? I...

42:31.900 --> 42:35.696
Oh, look who it is!

42:37.405 --> 42:40.242
It's Mr. Personality!

42:40.342 --> 42:43.779
He came here to brighten up
everybody's day, now didn't ya?

42:43.879 --> 42:46.449
I got a question for you, scumbag.

42:46.549 --> 42:51.545
How come you make everybody sick
at the very sight of you?

42:53.989 --> 42:57.259
You got the personality of a cobra
and I've had it up to here with that.

42:57.359 --> 42:59.762
Come on, Vinny, knock it off.

42:59.862 --> 43:01.864
Sit down!

43:01.964 --> 43:04.993
You have to excuse Vinny, Frank.

43:06.102 --> 43:08.938
Anyway, how are you doing today, Frank?

43:09.038 --> 43:12.008
- Doing good, Tony.
- Can I get you anything to eat?

43:12.108 --> 43:14.944
You don't have to be shy, we have
plenty of food. More coming out.

43:15.044 --> 43:16.846
No thanks, I'm not hungry.

43:17.346 --> 43:19.215
No?

43:19.315 --> 43:22.347
Give him his freakin' money,
let him get out of here.

43:29.192 --> 43:32.428
- Thanks.
- Frankie, Frankie.

43:32.528 --> 43:36.900
You know, not for nothing,
but we offer you food all the time.

43:37.000 --> 43:41.271
And never once... once,
do you ever sit down and eat with us.

43:41.371 --> 43:46.335
What's the matter? My gesture of
friendship doesn't agree with you?

43:47.878 --> 43:51.714
Look at me
when I'm talking to you, Frankie.

43:53.150 --> 43:56.487
Now I want to know why you
think you're too good for us.

43:56.587 --> 44:01.859
It's not that, Tony. It's just, you know,
I got some place I got to be in a hurry.

44:01.959 --> 44:05.830
Hurry? Where you got to be, Frankie?

44:05.930 --> 44:08.065
- Somewhere.
- Frank...

44:08.165 --> 44:11.702
the only place you should ever be
in a hurry to get to is home.

44:11.802 --> 44:15.005
Cause home is where the family is.
Here, look, let me show this.

44:15.105 --> 44:17.574
This is my family, alright?

44:17.674 --> 44:21.847
This is my wife, my kids when
they were younger, my grandkids.

44:21.947 --> 44:25.597
And this... this is the most
cherished picture I have of my father,

44:25.697 --> 44:28.025
God rest his soul.

44:29.354 --> 44:33.555
You know, I loved him more
than any son ever loved a father.

44:35.493 --> 44:37.095
What about you, Frankie?

44:37.195 --> 44:41.874
Do you have any pictures
of loved ones you'd like to show us?

44:43.034 --> 44:45.704
No? Why not?

44:45.804 --> 44:50.072
You're always in such a hurry,
I would think that you had hundreds,

44:50.172 --> 44:53.069
hundreds of pictures to show us.

44:56.181 --> 45:00.755
Now the next time that I ask you
to sit down and eat with us...

45:00.855 --> 45:03.028
make sure you have the time.

45:03.128 --> 45:05.858
Alright, now get the hell out of here.

45:05.958 --> 45:08.795
- Thanks, Tony.
- What did you say?

45:08.895 --> 45:11.355
What did you just mumble?

45:11.630 --> 45:14.157
I said thanks, Tony.

45:16.468 --> 45:19.063
So, anyway, about this weekend...

45:36.289 --> 45:39.893
<i>There's nothing more frustrating than
a man who just can't express himself.</i>

45:39.993 --> 45:43.088
You know, tell you how he feels.

45:43.864 --> 45:46.704
That makes him no different than a...

45:47.551 --> 45:51.538
lamp. Or a clay pigeon.

45:51.938 --> 45:55.932
Yeah, clay pigeon,
waiting to get blown up into pieces.

45:57.710 --> 46:02.370
Maybe that's why. Maybe that's
the root behind Frank Stone's...

46:02.470 --> 46:04.380
rage.

46:05.953 --> 46:09.657
<i>He just lives, second to second.</i>

46:10.057 --> 46:13.453
<i>Minute to minute. Murder to murder.</i>

46:15.063 --> 46:17.065
<i>Like an alcoholic.</i>

46:17.365 --> 46:19.926
Just one day at a time.

46:23.337 --> 46:25.564
That's my boy.

46:29.644 --> 46:32.686
<i>Bright eyes and colors</i>

46:32.786 --> 46:36.417
<i>Are blind again</i>

46:36.517 --> 46:40.418
<i>Haven't seen my love in</i>

46:40.518 --> 46:42.980
<i>God knows when</i>

46:43.080 --> 46:45.972
<i>He went away</i>

46:46.072 --> 46:50.197
<i>Now I'm all by myself</i>

46:50.297 --> 46:52.826
<i>All of this heart aching</i>

46:52.926 --> 46:56.509
<i>Is affecting my head</i>

46:56.809 --> 46:59.199
<i>Oh, no</i>

47:03.145 --> 47:06.492
<i>I've been so alone</i>

47:06.592 --> 47:12.142
<i>Waiting for you to get back home</i>

47:17.559 --> 47:20.766
<i>No more good mornings</i>

47:20.866 --> 47:24.500
<i>Or I love you</i>

47:24.600 --> 47:27.636
<i>Never thought my nightmares</i>

47:27.737 --> 47:31.285
<i>Would be so true...</i>

47:32.585 --> 47:37.880
<i>All this seems to fight for me</i>

47:37.980 --> 47:40.800
<i>But all I ever wanted</i>

47:40.900 --> 47:47.481
<i>Was for us to be alone</i>

47:51.027 --> 47:56.399
<i>I've been so alone, yeah, waiting for you</i>

47:56.499 --> 48:00.729
<i>I waited for you to come back home</i>

48:04.507 --> 48:07.985
<i>Yeah, I'm so alone</i>

48:08.085 --> 48:10.641
<i>I waited for you</i>

48:10.741 --> 48:15.311
<i>But now you're gone</i>

48:32.136 --> 48:36.373
Wasn't she great? Chelsea, let's give
it up for Chelsea. Great girl, nice act.

48:36.473 --> 48:41.837
And now, next, he's your favorite
ventriloquist, Mr. John Peasy.

48:43.781 --> 48:46.418
Hey, folks, my name is John Peasy,
this is my friend Smokey.

48:46.518 --> 48:50.222
Holy shit, they're all white! Okay,
we have a great crowd of people here.

48:50.322 --> 48:52.991
Yeah, they look good, this look good,
I like it. Yeah, we got a good crowd.

48:53.091 --> 48:56.528
I'm the only black guy here.
It looks like my trial.

48:56.928 --> 48:59.931
Looking good, looking good, looking good,
looking good! I like this crowd, yeah, yeah.

49:00.031 --> 49:03.335
If you like white people, yeah.
Hate them white men shit.

49:03.435 --> 49:06.738
Oh, yeah, now...
Hold up, where you going, brother?

49:06.838 --> 49:08.790
Sit the hell down,
where the hell you going?

49:08.890 --> 49:11.042
I hate when a white guy gets up
in the middle of a show like that.

49:11.142 --> 49:15.647
Sit the hell down, cracker ass. Sit the hell
down. I'm in the middle of my working here.

49:15.747 --> 49:17.911
Don't sit there and get up in the middle.
I'm working here.

49:18.011 --> 49:19.985
Don't pick on the guy.
He's a mean-looking guy.

49:20.085 --> 49:21.998
- What do you mean?
- He looks like a killer.

49:22.098 --> 49:25.949
Yeah, killer, I'll kick his ass.
Homo, sit the hell down.

49:26.759 --> 49:29.029
- Don't pick on the guy.
- I don't give a shit! I see you staring.

49:29.129 --> 49:31.464
Let's have a staring contest, go.

49:31.564 --> 49:35.334
This is comedy. You don't just get up
and walk out in the middle of a show.

49:35.434 --> 49:36.769
Alright, that's enough, that's enough.

49:36.869 --> 49:38.772
Why don't you say something to the guy
that would make him feel good?

49:38.872 --> 49:42.165
The way he looks,
attention K-Mart shopper.

49:42.475 --> 49:45.845
He's a loser,
I can't stand his white cracker ass.

49:46.445 --> 49:49.415
That's right, folks, you can laugh
all you want. I'll kick his ass right now.

49:49.515 --> 49:51.884
Loser, loser, loser.

49:51.984 --> 49:54.378
And you're white, cracker ass.

50:00.059 --> 50:04.398
Hey! This was just a joke, man,
I was only kiddin' ya!

50:04.498 --> 50:06.291
No, no!

50:14.341 --> 50:17.844
This week, Olivia's mailbox
wasn't empty as usual.

50:17.944 --> 50:20.880
This week, it contained
one of those lovely pink slips

50:20.980 --> 50:24.183
that indicated she had a package
at the front desk.

50:24.283 --> 50:28.455
The clerk was so excited for her.
Olivia, you have mail today!

50:28.555 --> 50:30.978
Politely, she smiled and took the package.

50:31.078 --> 50:33.627
It was a five dollar flat rate box.

50:33.727 --> 50:38.299
Olivia was reminded of how much
her mother loved sending flat rate boxes.

50:38.399 --> 50:41.747
Each week in college, Olivia would receive
one of these packages,

50:41.847 --> 50:45.978
a veritable treavure...
treasure trove of candy, costume,

50:46.078 --> 50:50.511
jewelry, school supplies,
anything a college girl could desire.

50:50.611 --> 50:54.315
The package that she was handed today
was considerately different.

50:54.415 --> 50:57.752
On the outside, it looked like a standard
five dollar flat rate box.

50:57.852 --> 51:00.588
But the contents had a macabre difference.

51:00.688 --> 51:03.950
This package contained her mother's ashes.

51:08.763 --> 51:11.699
You really have tapped
into something very personal.

51:11.799 --> 51:15.437
Now, class, what we can
take from Mario's story

51:15.537 --> 51:17.873
is don't be afraid to be deeply personal.

51:17.973 --> 51:20.934
Oscar, please come on time!

51:24.180 --> 51:26.916
Okay, Jackie, you had something
you wanted to read?

51:27.416 --> 51:29.209
Yeah.

51:33.089 --> 51:34.981
Alright.

51:35.991 --> 51:40.329
Rosemary thought she was different.
She was always told that.

51:40.429 --> 51:45.334
By her father, by her mother,
by her classmates.

51:45.434 --> 51:48.838
She grew up thinking bad about herself.

51:48.938 --> 51:52.675
That's why she tried to slit
her wrists many times.

51:52.775 --> 51:56.079
But she always managed to find
a way to get through it.

51:56.179 --> 51:59.816
She thought she had met someone
who could relate to her.

51:59.916 --> 52:02.152
Another tortured soul.

52:02.252 --> 52:05.122
But this person was more
than a tortured soul.

52:05.222 --> 52:09.159
He also felt the need
to be hateful and cruel.

52:09.259 --> 52:12.929
He didn't want to change himself
or discover who he really was.

52:13.029 --> 52:15.598
He didn't want to move on
from a dark past.

52:15.698 --> 52:20.137
He wanted to relive it every day.
He was pure nasty.

52:20.237 --> 52:23.165
I hate him, I hate him.

52:26.675 --> 52:32.299
I... Jackie, I must say you've really
tapped into something very personal

52:32.399 --> 52:34.810
to get this latest work.

52:37.488 --> 52:39.982
Anybody have any questions?

52:40.791 --> 52:42.626
Ackley?

52:42.726 --> 52:44.929
I have to say, I thought...

52:45.029 --> 52:46.889
Oscar!

52:48.266 --> 52:51.034
Oscar, please wait outside.

52:51.134 --> 52:52.895
Alright.

53:01.145 --> 53:03.038
Okay.

53:05.783 --> 53:07.743
That was weird.

53:09.121 --> 53:12.049
Alright, go to Jimmy's on 10th street.
You know the way.

53:15.894 --> 53:19.970
What the hell is that banana head
doing over there? Pull over, pull over.

53:24.603 --> 53:26.462
Stop.

53:32.344 --> 53:35.672
What the hell is Frank Stone
doing in this neighborhood?

53:47.527 --> 53:50.401
Wait up a second, I want to talk to you.

53:52.998 --> 53:55.735
Look, I'm sorry that I spoke
to you that way.

53:55.835 --> 53:58.838
Alright, I made a mistake.
I thought you were making fun of me.

53:59.238 --> 54:01.766
What do you want, Oscar?

54:02.258 --> 54:04.927
There's something I gotta tell you.

54:05.177 --> 54:07.647
Alright, my name isn't Oscar.

54:07.747 --> 54:10.040
It's Frank Stone.

54:11.183 --> 54:13.453
Your character?

54:13.553 --> 54:16.088
And I work for Anthony Forte.

54:16.188 --> 54:18.157
Tough Tony is real?

54:18.257 --> 54:22.710
It's all for real, alright?
That's what I am, I'm a hood.

54:25.031 --> 54:27.734
- Why are you telling me this?
- I don't know.

54:27.834 --> 54:31.697
I just feel like my head's
gonna explode if I don't tell you.

54:39.446 --> 54:43.184
Just please, just leave me alone.

54:43.284 --> 54:46.712
Please, I'm sorry.

54:47.138 --> 54:50.231
- I'm sorry.
- Please just stay away from me.

55:03.505 --> 55:05.965
What the hell was that all about?

55:07.942 --> 55:10.037
Wait here, I want to go see
what's going on.

55:30.031 --> 55:32.867
Did I almost get a smile out of you?

55:32.967 --> 55:34.827
Almost.

55:38.372 --> 55:41.134
Frank, how come you never smile?

55:44.380 --> 55:48.651
Can I ask you something? You never
once told me anything about yourself.

55:48.751 --> 55:53.203
Well, you know everything about me,
but I don't know anything about you.

55:55.624 --> 55:58.594
I'm just not that open about myself.

55:58.694 --> 56:02.265
- My private self, that is.
- Yeah?

56:02.965 --> 56:05.568
Is that why you joke around so much?

56:05.668 --> 56:08.337
To hide that private self?

56:08.437 --> 56:11.499
No, that's not why.

56:14.577 --> 56:18.359
You know, if you don't want
to talk about it, it's okay.

56:21.785 --> 56:23.475
Well, I...

56:23.575 --> 56:29.509
I married this really rich guy
that I didn't even love.

56:29.859 --> 56:33.888
But I figured I'd have everything.

56:35.732 --> 56:37.502
But...

56:38.384 --> 56:42.359
it wasn't really enough.

56:42.459 --> 56:45.509
But then we had a beautiful daughter.

56:45.609 --> 56:48.445
Beautiful, beautiful daughter.

56:48.545 --> 56:50.374
And...

56:51.420 --> 56:56.088
my husband left me and...

56:58.389 --> 57:01.493
He got full custody of her...

57:01.593 --> 57:04.680
and I can't even visit her.

57:06.564 --> 57:11.336
So you see,
all I want to do is just call her.

57:11.436 --> 57:15.765
Tell her I'm sorry and that I love her.

57:20.144 --> 57:23.888
- But I can't.
- You listen to me.

57:25.015 --> 57:27.552
I got to go right now.

57:27.652 --> 57:31.255
- Where are you going?
- I got to go.

57:31.355 --> 57:33.881
But when I get back...

57:34.281 --> 57:38.449
you and me, I'm gonna take you
to see your daughter.

57:39.598 --> 57:41.700
But she doesn't even know me.

57:41.800 --> 57:45.604
- She doesn't know me at all anymore.
- She knows who you are.

57:45.704 --> 57:50.242
And believe me, there's no time
like the present to get reacquainted.

57:50.342 --> 57:53.311
Everything's gonna be all right, Jackie.

57:53.411 --> 57:57.908
You'll see. I'll be back in a few hours.

58:15.167 --> 58:17.069
Hey, there he is!

58:17.169 --> 58:19.763
- Frankie!
- Frank!

58:20.206 --> 58:22.842
- Hey, Frank, have a seat.
- How you doing, Frank?

58:22.942 --> 58:24.977
How you doing, fellas?

58:25.077 --> 58:27.780
Today is your lucky day, Frank.

58:27.880 --> 58:31.684
We got a call from our boys out in Vegas
and they need someone from back east

58:31.784 --> 58:33.951
to run the security at the casino

58:34.051 --> 58:38.290
and to oversee all the used jewelry
business they got out there.

58:38.390 --> 58:41.494
And I couldn't think
of anybody but you, Frank.

58:41.594 --> 58:44.821
- Me?
- Yeah.

58:45.264 --> 58:48.769
Well, for how long?

58:49.069 --> 58:51.339
How long? For as long as it takes, Frank.

58:51.439 --> 58:55.096
You're gonna be making
a cool 200 grand there.

58:55.543 --> 58:58.771
- 200 thousand dollars?
- Yeah.

59:01.448 --> 59:05.786
- That's a lot of money, Tony.
- Yeah, you go out there, you work hard,

59:05.886 --> 59:08.489
you find one of those
show girls, you know...

59:08.589 --> 59:10.423
settle down with her a little bit

59:10.523 --> 59:13.861
and be happy for once in your life,
you miserable bastard!

59:13.961 --> 59:17.490
You know, I mean 200 grand
make anybody happy, right?

59:21.468 --> 59:23.895
When am I supposed to leave?

59:24.637 --> 59:27.233
First flight tomorrow.

59:31.179 --> 59:34.282
Hey, what's the matter?
You seem disinterested, Frank.

59:34.382 --> 59:36.949
No, that's not it. It's just that...

59:37.049 --> 59:40.955
you know, I got a little something
I gotta take care of with someone.

59:41.055 --> 59:45.247
You know, I'll definitely
make the flight, Tony.

59:46.427 --> 59:49.197
- Okay.
- Is there anything else?

59:49.497 --> 59:52.533
Yeah, just one more little thing.

59:52.633 --> 59:56.173
When you get out there,
I was just wondering...

59:56.273 --> 01:00:00.103
if you're gonna write any more stories
about me and my operation.

01:00:02.811 --> 01:00:05.385
Kill that rat bastard!

01:00:20.162 --> 01:00:23.766
No, no, no, Vinny, wait a minute, wait
a minute. Maybe we shouldn't do it here.

01:00:23.866 --> 01:00:27.847
You know what? Just take him down
to the warehouse and chop him up.

01:00:51.895 --> 01:00:54.422
Come on, let's go chop him up.

01:00:57.934 --> 01:00:59.893
Pop the trunk.

01:00:59.993 --> 01:01:02.695
- Who's this?
- Who's that?

01:01:03.206 --> 01:01:05.032
Hey, fellas.

01:01:05.375 --> 01:01:08.912
Can you tell me how to get
to the 59 street bridge?

01:01:09.012 --> 01:01:12.215
You keep going straight. If you hit
the water, it means you missed the bridge.

01:01:12.315 --> 01:01:14.585
Hey, man, your humor flows like molasses.

01:01:14.685 --> 01:01:17.553
And if you keep going straight
and you hit water,

01:01:17.653 --> 01:01:20.024
it means you missed the bridge.

01:01:20.925 --> 01:01:23.151
Call for backup.

01:01:24.061 --> 01:01:26.154
Tell him in Italian.

01:01:30.768 --> 01:01:33.671
Hey, why don't you keep smoking?
Or burn out.

01:01:33.771 --> 01:01:37.041
Central B5 requesting an additional unit.

01:01:55.927 --> 01:01:59.381
- Alright, call it in.
- 20 boy central, requesting one addition.

01:01:59.481 --> 01:02:01.397
<i>5 boy 4 by on there?</i>

01:02:04.336 --> 01:02:08.632
<i>Paging Dr. Bender.
Paging Dr. Bender, please.</i>

01:02:16.648 --> 01:02:19.877
<i>Dr. Bender to the mental ward, please.</i>

01:02:35.267 --> 01:02:37.704
How you doing, Frank?

01:02:38.104 --> 01:02:40.764
Mind if we talk to you for a minute?

01:02:48.181 --> 01:02:50.416
I don't think he heard us.

01:02:50.516 --> 01:02:53.077
Hey, Frank, can you hear us?

01:02:55.121 --> 01:02:59.417
How you feeling, Frank?
Been in a coma for a few weeks.

01:03:01.660 --> 01:03:04.430
I'm Detective Manteiga,
this Detective Maas.

01:03:04.530 --> 01:03:06.750
We're from the organized crime unit.

01:03:06.850 --> 01:03:09.746
We'd like to ask you
a couple of questions.

01:03:11.170 --> 01:03:14.734
Would you mind explaining to us how you
ended up in the trunk of Vinny Gallino's car?

01:03:16.476 --> 01:03:19.747
Yeah, Vinny Gallino.
He works for Tony Forte.

01:03:19.847 --> 01:03:22.507
Did you owe him and his boss some money?

01:03:25.385 --> 01:03:27.922
Come on, you know who we're talking about.

01:03:28.022 --> 01:03:30.557
Tony Forte, aka "Tough Tony".

01:03:30.657 --> 01:03:33.084
Did you owe them money?

01:03:37.998 --> 01:03:41.902
Come on, Frank.
Don't play dumb shit with us, alright?

01:03:42.302 --> 01:03:44.972
We're not rookies,
we've been around a long time.

01:03:45.072 --> 01:03:48.607
You obviously must have done
something to piss them off.

01:03:50.177 --> 01:03:54.369
What was it? Did you get caught
skimming off the top, or what?

01:04:03.224 --> 01:04:05.785
You mind telling us what's so funny?

01:04:11.666 --> 01:04:13.859
This guy's bananas.

01:04:19.807 --> 01:04:22.243
<i>Paging Dr. Statement,
Dr. Statement please.</i>

01:04:22.343 --> 01:04:24.245
So he's not crazy?

01:04:24.345 --> 01:04:27.849
Well, his head has no structural damage.

01:04:27.949 --> 01:04:32.088
But it's hard to say at this point
without doing any further tests.

01:04:32.188 --> 01:04:35.225
You think maybe you're trying
to put one over on us?

01:04:36.125 --> 01:04:38.528
I don't think so.

01:04:38.828 --> 01:04:41.263
Unbelievable.
The one guy we find and he's nuts.

01:04:41.363 --> 01:04:44.033
Anything he says is not gonna
hold up in court. You know that?

01:04:44.133 --> 01:04:47.536
Yeah. But I'm not buying it.

01:04:47.636 --> 01:04:49.663
Thanks, doc.

01:04:53.242 --> 01:04:57.279
You know, I came into this world
full of piss and vinegar.

01:04:57.379 --> 01:05:00.216
You know, I started making
my bones by running numbers

01:05:00.316 --> 01:05:03.285
for Hunchback Charlie
and the 9th Avenue boys?

01:05:03.385 --> 01:05:06.488
And I was still in junior
high school when I did that.

01:05:06.588 --> 01:05:10.226
I ran porn theater,
strip clubs, I had a stable,

01:05:10.326 --> 01:05:12.796
20 girls working for me.

01:05:12.896 --> 01:05:15.132
I started putting some money
out into the street,

01:05:15.232 --> 01:05:18.293
charging a vague that no one
could compete with.

01:05:20.670 --> 01:05:25.053
I made a lot of money for those fellas.
I made some serious scratch.

01:05:25.153 --> 01:05:27.369
You know, but then...

01:05:28.545 --> 01:05:30.705
The Babania...

01:05:30.805 --> 01:05:33.525
shooting up four times a day.

01:05:33.850 --> 01:05:36.354
Lost everything I had.

01:05:37.254 --> 01:05:41.358
Wound up doing ten years
in jail for armed robbery.

01:05:41.458 --> 01:05:43.527
Ten years.

01:05:43.627 --> 01:05:46.164
You know, when I got out, I was clean.

01:05:46.264 --> 01:05:48.933
And I wanted to get back
into the business, you know?

01:05:49.033 --> 01:05:50.815
So I had a...

01:05:50.915 --> 01:05:54.505
an uncle vouch for me.

01:05:54.605 --> 01:05:57.400
And I went back into action.

01:05:58.209 --> 01:06:01.959
And, now, it's taken me 30 years,

01:06:02.059 --> 01:06:06.450
30 years to get my reputation
back and I'll be damned...

01:06:06.550 --> 01:06:11.389
if I let some muck like
Frank Stone bring me down.

01:06:11.489 --> 01:06:13.891
Now I want that son
of a bitch taken care of.

01:06:13.991 --> 01:06:18.355
I want him put on ice.
And I want that done, now.

01:06:20.564 --> 01:06:24.688
Hate to be the one who told you so,
Tony, but I told you so.

01:06:42.521 --> 01:06:45.257
<i>Dr. Forest, dial 118, please.</i>

01:06:45.357 --> 01:06:49.286
<i>Dr. Forest, please dial 1-1-8.</i>

01:07:14.837 --> 01:07:17.908
<i>No matter where you roam</i>

01:07:27.967 --> 01:07:31.971
<i>They call it the blues</i>

01:07:40.081 --> 01:07:42.749
I have to sit next to you now.

01:07:42.949 --> 01:07:45.352
I gotta sit next to you!

01:07:45.652 --> 01:07:49.523
What's so funny, man?
What's so goddamn funny?

01:07:49.623 --> 01:07:53.352
Come on, white boy,
share with me the joke.

01:07:54.528 --> 01:08:00.467
See, last week this time,
I had a job, I had a car.

01:08:00.567 --> 01:08:02.703
I had a woman.

01:08:02.803 --> 01:08:07.609
A woman! I had a woman, white boy.

01:08:08.209 --> 01:08:11.645
I was making good money, Arizona.

01:08:11.745 --> 01:08:16.651
The place to be to work
for the right to make a living.

01:08:16.951 --> 01:08:20.322
I used to play in the band,
a band like rock 'n' roll.

01:08:20.421 --> 01:08:25.359
Stupid camisoles in the 80's,
that's where I met my girl.

01:08:25.859 --> 01:08:27.921
Well, my ex girl.

01:08:28.895 --> 01:08:31.357
She left me, white boy.

01:08:31.966 --> 01:08:33.868
She left me for...

01:08:33.968 --> 01:08:36.004
You're laughing!

01:08:36.104 --> 01:08:39.791
She left me for a short order cook...

01:08:39.890 --> 01:08:43.274
and goddamn Mexican!

01:08:46.180 --> 01:08:49.309
A goddamn Mexican!

01:08:51.153 --> 01:08:54.756
Dude... dude, that's just wrong, man.

01:08:54.857 --> 01:09:00.095
- My life sucks, white boy.
- What's your name, brother?

01:09:00.595 --> 01:09:02.523
John.

01:09:05.033 --> 01:09:08.871
But you can call me Cricket.
Everybody calls me Cricket.

01:09:08.970 --> 01:09:11.207
Cricket, Cricket, Cricket, like a cricket.

01:09:11.307 --> 01:09:13.109
- Cricket.
- That jumps around.

01:09:13.209 --> 01:09:17.011
- I jump around like a cricket.
- Oh, Cricket, baby.

01:09:17.112 --> 01:09:20.750
I love you, white boy,
you're the best, man.

01:09:21.250 --> 01:09:23.524
- I have a tattoo.
- Yeah?

01:09:23.625 --> 01:09:26.707
Tattoo of a cricket. Look, look, look.

01:09:26.807 --> 01:09:29.749
- Look at that!
- It's a cricket.

01:09:30.024 --> 01:09:32.028
Listen, you know, brother?

01:09:32.127 --> 01:09:35.399
I really appreciate you
opening up to me like this, brother.

01:09:35.499 --> 01:09:37.734
I mean, really, I do, you know?

01:09:37.834 --> 01:09:39.935
- I mean, from the heart.
- The heart?

01:09:40.036 --> 01:09:43.340
You know what I'm saying?
From the heart, brother.

01:09:44.441 --> 01:09:46.768
Holy shit, man!

01:09:47.310 --> 01:09:48.812
Oh, man!

01:09:48.912 --> 01:09:51.848
Dammit! Goddammit!

01:09:56.152 --> 01:09:59.038
Alright, guys,
finish your drink and get out.

01:09:59.138 --> 01:10:00.857
Wait a minute.

01:10:00.957 --> 01:10:03.827
Wait, you throwing me out of here
for laughing? Is that...

01:10:03.927 --> 01:10:06.496
I mean, what is wrong with this place?

01:10:06.596 --> 01:10:09.366
Hey! This place sucks!

01:10:09.466 --> 01:10:13.504
Hit the door, pal.
I want you out of here, now.

01:10:13.604 --> 01:10:17.633
Alright, alright, alright.
Look, no hard feelings.

01:10:19.910 --> 01:10:22.213
Alright, I'm going, okay?

01:10:22.313 --> 01:10:26.216
I'm going. Hey, what's that on your nose?

01:10:29.154 --> 01:10:31.380
Crazy, man!

01:10:31.956 --> 01:10:34.392
- Goddammit!
- Hey, Cricket.

01:10:34.492 --> 01:10:36.819
Goddammit, man!

01:10:39.697 --> 01:10:41.499
Hi.

01:10:42.433 --> 01:10:44.034
Hello?

01:10:44.134 --> 01:10:47.810
Hey, listen, I've had a hell of a day.
I just broke out of a hospital.

01:10:48.907 --> 01:10:51.588
What the hell you laughing at, it's true!

01:10:52.461 --> 01:10:55.597
These fuckin' guys tried to kill me.

01:10:56.047 --> 01:10:58.184
They did! They took guns,
they were shooting at me,

01:10:58.284 --> 01:11:01.812
they shot up the place,
they shot up my pillow.

01:11:03.389 --> 01:11:07.284
Well, I needed something to wear,
so I borrowed these.

01:11:08.494 --> 01:11:12.656
The guy next to me was dying of TB,
I figured he didn't need 'em.

01:11:13.565 --> 01:11:16.134
You're kind of a fun audience.

01:11:16.234 --> 01:11:18.330
You, you, I love you.

01:11:18.430 --> 01:11:20.722
Oh, my God, you!

01:11:26.946 --> 01:11:30.116
I had eight dollars stashed in my socks.

01:11:30.216 --> 01:11:32.852
And I dug it out and stuck it in my pocket

01:11:32.952 --> 01:11:36.656
as I walked up Broadway
towards 137 Street.

01:11:36.756 --> 01:11:40.226
I saw Flockle standing in front
of the subway entrance.

01:11:40.326 --> 01:11:43.188
"What's happening", I said. Not much.

01:12:01.280 --> 01:12:03.542
Yo, what are you doing?

01:12:05.419 --> 01:12:07.312
No!

01:12:07.688 --> 01:12:09.425
No!

01:12:10.223 --> 01:12:12.517
What are you doing?

01:12:33.080 --> 01:12:35.816
<i>Dear Jackie, it's your friend, Frank.</i>

01:12:35.916 --> 01:12:40.579
<i>I've been meaning to call you for some
time now, but thought this note would do.</i>

01:12:43.725 --> 01:12:46.595
<i>Something happened that changed my life.</i>

01:12:46.695 --> 01:12:51.343
<i>I'm still not sure what exactly,
but all I know is that I'm happy.</i>

01:12:51.443 --> 01:12:54.536
<i>Truly happy for the first time.</i>

01:12:54.636 --> 01:12:56.971
<i>And I want you to be happy.</i>

01:12:57.071 --> 01:13:01.090
<i>So I suggest we see your daughter
together as originally planned</i>

01:13:01.190 --> 01:13:03.912
<i>so you can tell her that you love her.</i>

01:13:04.012 --> 01:13:06.715
<i>Meet me at the coffee shop
tomorrow at three o'clock.</i>

01:13:06.815 --> 01:13:08.850
<i>And we'll leave together.</i>

01:13:08.950 --> 01:13:11.820
<i>I can't wait to look
at your inspiring presence</i>

01:13:11.920 --> 01:13:14.689
<i>and your beautiful face once again.</i>

01:13:14.789 --> 01:13:18.995
<i>Thank you very, very much for taking
the time to understand me.</i>

01:13:19.895 --> 01:13:22.990
<i>Your friend, always, Frank.</i>

01:13:30.172 --> 01:13:31.674
Frank?

01:13:31.774 --> 01:13:34.076
How the hell did you get in here?

01:13:34.176 --> 01:13:38.773
That letter you wrote me
was so beautiful, I cried like a baby.

01:13:39.415 --> 01:13:41.942
Like a baby, huh?

01:13:43.118 --> 01:13:45.145
Look at me.

01:13:49.191 --> 01:13:51.494
I want to ask you one question.
One question.

01:13:51.594 --> 01:13:55.756
If I don't like the answer,
we're gonna bash your face in.

01:13:58.502 --> 01:14:02.063
Frank take you to Coney Island, huh?

01:14:03.039 --> 01:14:05.509
Did he do this to you, huh?

01:14:06.009 --> 01:14:08.303
Did he do this to you?

01:14:08.945 --> 01:14:11.582
I'm gonna ask you one question.

01:14:12.182 --> 01:14:14.542
Where is Frank Stone?

01:14:17.554 --> 01:14:20.624
- I swear I don't know.
- Answer him.

01:14:21.024 --> 01:14:23.167
One more time...

01:14:23.267 --> 01:14:25.860
where is Frank Stone?

01:14:27.030 --> 01:14:29.891
I swear I don't know!

01:14:33.870 --> 01:14:36.441
Where is Frank Stone?

01:14:36.541 --> 01:14:38.676
I swear I don't know.

01:14:38.776 --> 01:14:41.804
I'd tell you if I did, I swear,
but I don't know.

01:14:46.584 --> 01:14:48.810
Finish her off.

01:15:16.481 --> 01:15:19.535
Oh, if it isn't Cocky and Snowwinkle?

01:15:19.635 --> 01:15:20.986
What's up, Frank?

01:15:21.086 --> 01:15:24.623
Paper time's over, pajama boy.
Enough of the clown routine.

01:15:25.223 --> 01:15:27.526
Catch any bad guys lately, coppers?

01:15:27.626 --> 01:15:32.198
Cut the bullshit, Frank, alright?
We want you to testify against Tough Tony.

01:15:32.598 --> 01:15:36.267
I don't wanna, you know?
I'm having so much fun,

01:15:36.367 --> 01:15:38.904
just hanging out and being happy.

01:15:39.104 --> 01:15:41.740
Why are you protecting this piece
of garbage? He tried to have you killed.

01:15:41.840 --> 01:15:46.036
So did my mother, but I don't
hold that against her, huh?

01:15:47.880 --> 01:15:50.115
Yeah, well, I can understand
why your mother hated you.

01:15:50.215 --> 01:15:52.822
I know you five seconds
and I can't stand you.

01:15:53.052 --> 01:15:57.557
Detective, you should really try
a more refreshing breath mint.

01:15:59.057 --> 01:16:02.662
You think you're crazy, huh, Frank?
Look at that.

01:16:02.762 --> 01:16:05.231
But I'm the one who's crazy around here.

01:16:05.331 --> 01:16:09.435
I'm from east New York. Brooklyn, kid.
We used to throw people off rooftops.

01:16:09.535 --> 01:16:14.173
Stick up gangsters. Rob drug dealers,
then we'd sell it back to them.

01:16:14.623 --> 01:16:18.086
So don't sit here and think
you're the only one that's crazy.

01:16:19.545 --> 01:16:21.548
Let me tell you something.

01:16:21.648 --> 01:16:25.543
If I didn't have this badge,
I'd forget that I'm a cop.

01:16:28.288 --> 01:16:30.557
I'd really listen to that, Frank.

01:16:30.657 --> 01:16:33.419
What are you gonna do?
You gonna throw me off a rooftop?

01:16:42.570 --> 01:16:44.829
Then keep laughing.

01:16:46.073 --> 01:16:49.101
Aren't you supposed to meet
that girl that you like?

01:16:50.678 --> 01:16:52.771
Jackie, right?

01:16:54.849 --> 01:16:58.410
I got something for you.
You're gonna like this.

01:17:03.357 --> 01:17:05.480
She's waiting for you at this address.

01:17:05.580 --> 01:17:07.921
Now that's funny.

01:17:14.736 --> 01:17:16.463
Is Jackie Mott here?

01:17:23.011 --> 01:17:25.070
Oh, no.

01:18:15.697 --> 01:18:16.966
Where'd you take us?

01:18:17.066 --> 01:18:20.169
I told you, this is the best rub
and tub joint in the city, bar none.

01:18:20.269 --> 01:18:22.371
- See, this is what I'm talking about.
- She's nice.

01:18:22.471 --> 01:18:26.309
- Hello. Follow me, please.
- Sure, anywhere.

01:19:42.687 --> 01:19:45.182
Come on, I want to win tonight.

01:22:04.499 --> 01:22:06.569
Yeah, it's me.

01:22:06.669 --> 01:22:09.672
I have a problem that needs fixing.

01:22:11.174 --> 01:22:14.878
I found this rat in my kitchen

01:22:14.978 --> 01:22:17.831
and it needs to be
exterminated right away.

01:22:20.950 --> 01:22:25.559
I want you to get the best exterminator
that money can buy, that's what I want.

01:22:29.658 --> 01:22:31.681
He's the best?

01:22:33.396 --> 01:22:35.673
Alright, set up a meeting.

01:22:57.154 --> 01:22:59.682
Now I want to hire you...

01:22:59.782 --> 01:23:03.427
'cause word got around to me
that you're the best.

01:23:03.527 --> 01:23:05.529
I know what people call you by reputation.

01:23:05.629 --> 01:23:09.524
What should I call you?
What do you call yourself?

01:23:20.577 --> 01:23:22.071
Lucifer.

01:23:23.380 --> 01:23:25.240
Lucifer.

01:23:26.017 --> 01:23:29.420
I'm gonna give you a chance
to live up to that name.

01:23:29.520 --> 01:23:33.380
Because this isn't business...

01:23:33.480 --> 01:23:36.205
this is personal.

01:23:36.361 --> 01:23:40.684
I want you to cause Frank Stone...

01:23:40.784 --> 01:23:46.437
more pain and suffering
than humanly possible.

01:23:46.537 --> 01:23:48.839
I want you to cause him
more pain and suffering

01:23:48.939 --> 01:23:52.535
than you ever caused anybody, ever.

01:23:55.180 --> 01:23:57.874
Do... do we understand each other?

01:24:20.206 --> 01:24:22.533
Frank, open up.

01:24:24.243 --> 01:24:26.737
We have a search warrant.

01:24:29.381 --> 01:24:31.317
Frank, open up.

01:24:31.417 --> 01:24:33.644
You think he's in there?

01:24:37.223 --> 01:24:40.621
Come on, Frank,
or we're gonna bust down the door.

01:24:42.795 --> 01:24:45.089
Frank, open up.

01:27:12.549 --> 01:27:13.709
Well?

01:27:16.537 --> 01:27:18.730
Did you get him?

01:27:20.557 --> 01:27:23.084
I asked you a question.

01:27:29.049 --> 01:27:33.007
Did you kill him?
Did you kill Frank Stone?

01:27:36.340 --> 01:27:38.267
What's the matter with you?

01:27:53.658 --> 01:27:55.718
Bye, Dad.

01:27:58.730 --> 01:28:01.090
You're Sarah, right?

01:28:01.999 --> 01:28:03.968
My name is Frank.

01:28:04.068 --> 01:28:06.463
I was a friend of your mom's.

01:28:07.405 --> 01:28:10.362
She wanted me to tell you something.

01:28:12.043 --> 01:28:15.347
She wanted me to tell you
that she loved ya.

01:28:15.447 --> 01:28:18.408
That she always loved you.

01:28:58.023 --> 01:29:00.417
How you doin', Tony?

01:29:02.327 --> 01:29:04.154
Alright.

01:29:04.563 --> 01:29:06.833
Alright, Frank.

01:29:06.933 --> 01:29:08.335
You got me.

01:29:08.435 --> 01:29:12.338
So just do what you got to do.
Alright, I just made peace with my maker.

01:29:12.438 --> 01:29:15.074
I don't care about dying.
Go ahead, do what you got to do.

01:29:15.174 --> 01:29:17.903
Do you really think a one minute prayer...

01:29:18.003 --> 01:29:20.914
is going to straighten things out
with the big guy upstairs, Tony?

01:29:21.014 --> 01:29:25.785
Yeah, I do. He knows
what I did was out of necessity.

01:29:25.885 --> 01:29:27.745
Necessity?

01:29:31.891 --> 01:29:33.684
Frank!

01:29:36.630 --> 01:29:38.832
You feel it, Tony?

01:29:38.932 --> 01:29:43.284
That's the feeling of pain and agony
that you cause people out of necessity.

01:29:43.854 --> 01:29:46.106
I'm an avenging angel, Tony.

01:29:46.206 --> 01:29:49.034
This time you hurt the wrong person.

01:30:04.723 --> 01:30:08.666
Yeah, I feel better.
I used to be a bit of a partier.

01:30:08.766 --> 01:30:11.066
I used to drink too much.
A lot of people say to me

01:30:11.166 --> 01:30:14.669
"Art, what's a wild night of drinking to you?
You look like you've had a few." And I have.

01:30:14.769 --> 01:30:18.539
A wild night of drinking to me is when you
drink too much and eventually you pass out.

01:30:18.639 --> 01:30:21.810
And when you wake up, you're naked
in a police car with two cops.

01:30:21.910 --> 01:30:25.005
But the weird part is, you're driving.

01:30:26.147 --> 01:30:27.916
That'll be a wild night of drinking!

01:30:28.016 --> 01:30:30.985
Not for you, man.
That's like a Tuesday night for you.

01:30:32.020 --> 01:30:34.690
I did a lot of drugs, as well.

01:30:34.890 --> 01:30:38.293
The reason I did drugs was, I think, the
anti-drug slogans when I was a kid were bad.

01:30:38.393 --> 01:30:41.930
Like, remember "hugs are better
than drugs". That didn't work for me.

01:30:42.030 --> 01:30:44.265
My mother used to scream
that at me as I left the house.

01:30:44.365 --> 01:30:47.068
"Remember, hugs are better than drugs."
And I believed her.

01:30:47.168 --> 01:30:50.972
I believed everything my mother said
until the first time I got high at a party.

01:30:51.072 --> 01:30:53.074
I leaned back and I was like "wow."

01:30:53.174 --> 01:30:56.412
"This is way better
than when my mother hugs me."

01:30:56.512 --> 01:30:59.049
"What else has she been
lying to me about?"

01:30:59.149 --> 01:31:02.285
Do I not have great bone structure?

01:31:02.885 --> 01:31:06.289
Am I not the best looking boy
in New Jersey?

01:31:06.589 --> 01:31:08.324
Hugs are great, but better than drugs?

01:31:08.424 --> 01:31:11.961
Come on, let's not lie to the kids.
Let me put it to you this way.

01:31:12.061 --> 01:31:15.899
I never drove to Harlem at 4 am
to get somebody to hug me.

01:31:17.099 --> 01:31:20.993
Hey, Carlos, here's 20 bucks,
just put your arms around me.

01:31:22.539 --> 01:31:24.240
I grew up with a domineering mother.

01:31:24.340 --> 01:31:26.876
She would say stuff at the top of her lungs,
screaming at me.

01:31:26.976 --> 01:31:29.846
Some bad, some good, it was confusing.
I didn't know what to do.

01:31:29.946 --> 01:31:33.049
She would say stuff like "I hate you!"
"I never want to see you again."

01:31:33.149 --> 01:31:35.452
"Are you hungry?"

01:31:35.552 --> 01:31:37.621
"Get out of this house
and never come back."

01:31:37.721 --> 01:31:40.858
"There are chicken goblets
in the refrigerator."

01:31:40.958 --> 01:31:44.194
And since then, I gained some weight.
I'm not gonna lie, I've had weight issues.

01:31:44.294 --> 01:31:47.498
I try to lose weight. Someone said "You wanna
lose weight?" "You should go swimming."

01:31:47.598 --> 01:31:49.667
I've never been swimming
before in my life.

01:31:49.767 --> 01:31:53.558
And that's because it has never been more
than a half an hour since I last ate.

01:31:54.004 --> 01:31:56.367
You know what I'm talking about?

01:32:15.994 --> 01:32:17.962
<i>Any questions?</i>

01:32:18.062 --> 01:32:19.855
<i>No?</i>

01:32:19.964 --> 01:32:22.659
<i>Alright then, well, let's move on.</i>

01:32:24.603 --> 01:32:28.740
<i>From nothingness came I,
and it is where I shall go.</i>

01:32:28.840 --> 01:32:32.043
<i>Well, at least that's
what I used to think.</i>

01:32:32.143 --> 01:32:35.016
<i>During those lonely days
and sleepless nights,</i>

01:32:35.116 --> 01:32:38.216
<i>to pacify my soul,
I would say these words.</i>

01:32:38.316 --> 01:32:41.452
<i>They made me, somehow,
understand my existence</i>

01:32:41.552 --> 01:32:44.289
<i>until I had to live
another day of coldness.</i>

01:32:44.989 --> 01:32:47.926
<i>And I lived those days and wept.</i>

01:32:48.026 --> 01:32:51.295
<i>Like all men who contemplate their agony.</i>

01:32:51.395 --> 01:32:54.566
<i>Then, like a ray of sun
peaking through the clouds,</i>

01:32:54.666 --> 01:32:56.946
<i>you came shining on to me.</i>

01:32:57.169 --> 01:33:00.840
<i>With a radiance only the birds
of paradise could understand.</i>

01:33:00.940 --> 01:33:03.475
<i>Bringing forth wisdom and beauty,</i>

01:33:03.575 --> 01:33:06.145
<i>compassion and understanding.</i>

01:33:06.245 --> 01:33:07.352
<i>Mercy.</i>

01:33:09.949 --> 01:33:12.417
<i>Then, without warning,
you left this world.</i>

01:33:12.517 --> 01:33:16.442
<i>But not without teaching me
who I am and what I should be.</i>

01:33:16.542 --> 01:33:18.391
<i>And where I should go.</i>

01:33:18.591 --> 01:33:21.835
<i>And it is that
which I am most grateful for.</i>

01:33:21.935 --> 01:33:25.054
<i>That you taught me to see the light.</i>

01:33:32.038 --> 01:33:35.032
Have a good night, Tony,
I'll see you tomorrow.

01:34:00.734 --> 01:34:02.468
Hey, Tony?

01:34:02.568 --> 01:34:04.830
I changed my mind.

01:34:26.093 --> 01:34:28.963
I'm a person who knew Frank Stone, okay?

01:34:29.063 --> 01:34:31.566
When he was a little, little boy.

01:34:32.166 --> 01:34:35.703
Before he had a chance
to turn his rage on the world.

01:34:36.403 --> 01:34:38.263
Okay?

01:34:40.975 --> 01:34:43.001
Who are you?

01:34:43.444 --> 01:34:46.839
And if you know, you'd be
the first person I ever met that did.

01:34:49.684 --> 01:34:51.544
Okay?

01:34:52.320 --> 01:34:54.815
I got nothing else to say to you.

01:34:56.558 --> 01:35:00.663
Now many men don't mean this
when they say it, but I do.

01:35:00.763 --> 01:35:04.132
If you don't leave here right now,
I'm gonna kill you.

01:35:04.232 --> 01:35:06.178
Okay?

01:35:07.305 --> 01:35:13.507
