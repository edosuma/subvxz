Empty gun shooting blanks.
Yup, that's me.

24:56.960 --> 25:00.009
I just need that back.
And also, if you could

25:00.080 --> 25:04.165
see it in your heart, Mr. Pozinho,
to reimburse us for the pills,

25:04.240 --> 25:07.961

Alison, honey,
I said to wait in the car.

25:39.840 --> 25:42.730
You were taking long time.

25:42.800 --> 25:47.328
I came to check up husband.

25:47.520 --> 25:48.885
What's up with your voice?

25:49.440 --> 25:51.124
(COUGHS) I have a cold.

25:51.200 --> 25:54.044
DONNIE: Yeah, yeah.
It's one of those really bad ones

25:54.120 --> 25:55.963
that messes with your syntax.

25:56.040 --> 25:57.690
You know what? Why don't you
just save your voice, honey,

25:57.760 --> 25:59.967
because Louisa here is
gonna give us the tank back.

26:11.600 --> 26:15.810
Oh! So, Mr. Pozinho,
what about that refund?

26:21.000 --> 26:22.081
<i>Vamos.</i>

26:23.440 --> 26:24.726
You wash my money.

26:24.800 --> 26:26.962
There's no refund, Mr. Hendrix.

26:27.040 --> 26:28.610
You work for my uncle now.

26:32.600 --> 26:34.170

getting back in the business.

26:39.840 --> 26:41.365
We know where you live.

26:42.320 --> 26:44.800
We know where
Oscar and Gemma go to school.

26:51.560 --> 26:53.528
Did you threaten babies?

26:53.600 --> 26:55.409
DONNIE: Alison, honey, let's go.

26:56.320 --> 26:57.287
Let's just get out of here, okay?

27:02.080 --> 27:03.286
Open the door! Stop!

27:03.360 --> 27:05.681
You should not threaten babies.

DONNIE: Helena, don't do this!

27:11.480 --> 27:12.481
What are you doing here?

27:12.960 --> 27:14.689
You expected someone else?

27:14.760 --> 27:16.728
That's cute. Are you alone?

27:16.800 --> 27:18.404
That's none of your business.
And you canâ€™t just...

Cosima's coming back.

What? Why?

27:36.840 --> 27:39.207
Take them off, or they will.

We're gonna have a conversation.

Out with you, come on.

27:55.720 --> 27:57.961
- I said come on, didn't I?
- Hey, hey! God!

Hey! Jesus!

We're gonna have a nice little chat.

SARAH: Hey, that's enough!
You leave him alone.

28:02.280 --> 28:04.567
I'll let him go when you start talking!

28:04.640 --> 28:07.450
And don't even think about
pulling that gun out of your pants.

28:07.520 --> 28:09.921
Or I'll snap this little tosser's neck.

28:10.000 --> 28:11.809
- You're the one that we called, then?
- Yeah.

28:11.880 --> 28:13.530
And you're not
bleeding Siobhan, are you?

28:13.600 --> 28:14.522
So, talk.

28:14.600 --> 28:17.888
I'm Sarah. Right? He is Felix.

Yeah, yeah. You know me?

28:30.880 --> 28:31.802
Yeah.

28:31.880 --> 28:35.851
I had to track you down
20-odd years back or so.

28:35.920 --> 28:38.048
I moved you about from place to place.

28:38.360 --> 28:39.407
You're Kasov.

28:39.920 --> 28:42.241
So, where the bloody hell is your mum?

28:42.320 --> 28:43.401
She...

28:43.480 --> 28:46.165
She wanted Terry to help her
find that prisoner.

28:46.240 --> 28:48.242
- You helped him.
- Yeah. And what of it?

28:48.440 --> 28:50.442
We need to know what you found out.

28:54.600 --> 28:56.967
A friend of mine in the parole service
sent me that.

Will you take us there?

29:10.160 --> 29:11.161
Please.

29:11.520 --> 29:13.409
Yup. It's great, Ali. Yeah.

29:13.480 --> 29:17.246
Uh, Gracie is at the doctor's,
I think, and, um...

Yeah, yeah. I got it...

29:35.080 --> 29:36.445
I got refund.

We should go now.

You know, for someone
of your income,

30:03.480 --> 30:05.448
the lease on this place
is quite expensive.

30:06.320 --> 30:08.766
It's none of your concern
how I pay for things.

30:09.080 --> 30:10.844
If the money comes from CASTOR, it is.

30:11.360 --> 30:13.010

so weird this morning.

we've come into some money.

- Like, a lot of money.

there was a girl I knew very well.

of DNA in this house.

40:25.920 --> 40:27.285
We can't leave a trace of her.

40:27.400 --> 40:30.643
Oh, there she goes,
threatening to burn my house down again.

40:33.520 --> 40:35.045
<i>Not just the house that has to go.</i>

40:35.120 --> 40:36.246
SARAH: Jesus, S.

40:36.320 --> 40:38.687
MRS. S: Said it yourself, Sarah,
CASTOR has to be stopped.

40:38.760 --> 40:39.886
That's your mum.

40:39.960 --> 40:41.689
Is this what it's come to, Siobhan?

40:42.000 --> 40:44.571
CASTOR and LEDA are siblings, S.

40:45.840 --> 40:47.569
- So what?
- So, if your mum has

40:47.640 --> 40:49.688
two cell lines that means
that she's our original too.

40:50.160 --> 40:51.207
We need her.

40:52.400 --> 40:53.481
She's LEDA.

40:59.960 --> 41:01.883
Why didn't you tell me
you were in the military, Shay?

41:02.800 --> 41:03.881
I'm gonna give you one chance at a deal.

41:04.080 --> 41:05.684
That's not how it's going to work.

41:06.440 --> 41:07.407
(GASPS)

41:12.000 --> 41:13.968
- Five minutes max to kiss babies, okay?
- ALISON: Mmm-hmm.

41:14.240 --> 41:15.651
Who is keeping me here?

41:16.920 --> 41:18.843
