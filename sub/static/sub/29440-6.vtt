WEBVTT

00:03.069 --> 00:04.488
You think
we gon' get married

00:04.488 --> 00:07.745
and have kids that turn out
like Darius and Darren?

00:07.745 --> 00:08.998
You don't get it.

00:11.753 --> 00:15.010
I don't know
if I could ever forgive myself

00:15.010 --> 00:16.972
for the‐‐
the pain I caused,

00:16.972 --> 00:18.892
but I want to change.

00:18.892 --> 00:20.688
‐ I'm releasing you on parole.

00:20.688 --> 00:22.984
Eight months
in a rehab facility
of the court's choosing.

00:25.615 --> 00:26.908
Damn, son.
‐ You hear that?

00:26.908 --> 00:28.620
You definitely
found your lane.

00:28.620 --> 00:30.081
That beat is hard.

00:30.081 --> 00:31.500
I heard Divine
getting out today.

00:31.500 --> 00:33.004
‐ Yeah.

00:33.004 --> 00:35.216
‐ Tell your brother
I said, "What's up?"

00:35.216 --> 00:37.471
‐ Linda, where's your sister?
‐ My sister?

00:37.471 --> 00:40.435
‐ I can tell
when I've worn out my welcome.

00:40.435 --> 00:42.982
Your pig sister
cheated on the numbers.

00:42.982 --> 00:44.569
Somebody else
has gotta make it right.

00:44.569 --> 00:46.238
‐ Yo, my moms is in trouble.

00:46.238 --> 00:48.702
‐ I want back in.
‐ You just got out.

00:48.702 --> 00:50.873
Your PO's watching
your every move.

00:50.873 --> 00:52.292
Yo, if you need money‐‐
Nah.

00:52.292 --> 00:53.712
No, no, no, I'm good.

00:53.712 --> 00:55.256
‐ If you wanna go
down that road,

00:55.256 --> 00:57.678
you're gonna have to go alone.

00:57.678 --> 00:59.808
Don't you got a curfew?

01:04.191 --> 01:05.986
‐ Who's Mom
talking to upstairs?

01:05.986 --> 01:08.533
Jerome.
Jerome?

01:08.533 --> 01:10.120
I hear from him.

01:10.120 --> 01:12.249
Any time his black ass
need money.

02:38.797 --> 02:40.593
‐ Jerome?

02:44.057 --> 02:46.646
‐ Hey, beautiful.

03:49.271 --> 03:51.985
Did you play sports
when you were a kid?

03:51.985 --> 03:54.030
Did I play sports?

03:54.030 --> 03:55.993
Well, don't you know, I had
my own uniform and everything.

03:55.993 --> 03:59.249
I was number 40,
after Gale Sayers.

03:59.249 --> 04:01.629
‐ Who's that?

04:01.629 --> 04:04.594
‐ Only the best running back
and my number one hero.

04:04.594 --> 04:07.307
‐ Spider‐Man's my hero.

04:07.307 --> 04:10.354
‐ Sayers was a hero
on and off the field.

04:10.354 --> 04:12.358
Wasn't just the best
running back.

04:12.358 --> 04:14.739
Did a lot of good things
to help people.

04:14.739 --> 04:16.701
‐ I wanna be
a running back too.

04:16.701 --> 04:18.204
‐ My man.

04:18.204 --> 04:20.834
‐ What y'all cutting up about
in there?

04:20.834 --> 04:22.963
I would come home
after practice every day

04:22.963 --> 04:25.719
to a big old house.

04:25.719 --> 04:30.186
Yard full of green grass,
a fence, and everything.

04:30.186 --> 04:32.983
‐ For real?

04:32.983 --> 04:34.904
‐ And there's a house
just like it

04:34.904 --> 04:37.910
waiting for us in Ohio.

04:37.910 --> 04:39.956
‐ Like this?

04:41.458 --> 04:43.880
‐ There ain't hardly no grass
in there.

04:45.508 --> 04:48.807
I'm talking about a yard...

04:48.807 --> 04:50.476
this big.

04:50.476 --> 04:52.898
‐ For real?

04:52.898 --> 04:55.153
‐ As real as I'm sitting here
right now.

04:56.948 --> 04:59.077
The air is even cleaner there.

05:00.538 --> 05:02.542
Take a deep breath in.

05:04.337 --> 05:07.260
‐

05:07.260 --> 05:09.431
‐ See?

05:09.431 --> 05:11.978
In Ohio, ain't no coughing.

05:11.978 --> 05:14.232
It's clean.

05:14.232 --> 05:16.779
Easy living.

05:16.779 --> 05:19.451
They got cows in Ohio?
Yeah.

05:19.451 --> 05:23.209
Cows, goats, horses.

05:23.209 --> 05:25.714
You name it.
I wanna ride a horse.

05:25.714 --> 05:27.593
When we get to Ohio,

05:27.593 --> 05:30.891
I'll take you horseback riding,
for sure.

05:30.891 --> 05:32.185
‐ Randy.

05:34.314 --> 05:36.903
You do know your daddy's
messing with you, right?

05:36.903 --> 05:39.032
I ain't messing around.

05:39.032 --> 05:42.497
There's a tiny little sliver
of land in Ohio

05:42.497 --> 05:45.253
that I've been sitting on
for years now.

05:45.253 --> 05:46.673
The thing is,

05:46.673 --> 05:51.014
this tiny little sliver of land
got minerals in it.

05:51.014 --> 05:52.016
‐ Oh.

05:52.016 --> 05:53.394
‐ And there's a energy company

05:53.394 --> 05:55.607
wants to take it
off my hands bad.

05:55.607 --> 05:57.861
With the clean air,

05:57.861 --> 06:01.953
green grass,
and a real kitchen.

06:01.953 --> 06:04.583
You'd even get your own room.

06:04.583 --> 06:07.380
‐
You gonna throw in

06:07.380 --> 06:10.052
the Verrazzano Bridge,
seal the deal?

06:10.052 --> 06:11.889
‐ You won't be laughing
when I put you

06:11.889 --> 06:13.643
in that dream house
you always wanted.

06:13.643 --> 06:16.273
It ain't gon' be
no rental neither.

06:16.273 --> 06:18.193
‐ All right,
what other fairy tales you got

06:18.193 --> 06:21.199
to tell me about Ohio?

06:25.166 --> 06:27.963
‐ I already got the house
picked out.

06:29.759 --> 06:33.683
Got a job lined up,
pays real good.

06:33.683 --> 06:36.438
Because, you see...

06:36.438 --> 06:39.402
sometimes...

06:39.402 --> 06:41.866
fairy tales do come true, baby.

06:50.257 --> 06:51.677
‐ Okay.

06:51.677 --> 06:54.224
Come on here with me.

06:55.936 --> 06:59.860
You wanna tell me
your little stories, fine.

06:59.860 --> 07:01.823
But leave that boy alone.

07:01.823 --> 07:05.037
He believe anything you say.

07:05.037 --> 07:07.751
‐ Nah, I told you already.

07:07.751 --> 07:10.715
This ain't no story.

07:10.715 --> 07:13.805
But look here...

07:13.805 --> 07:16.101
you wanna hear a story?

07:16.101 --> 07:19.440
I'm happy
to tell you one later.

07:19.440 --> 07:21.779
At bedtime.

07:21.779 --> 07:24.869
‐ Don't even.

07:24.869 --> 07:29.252
I got too much
on my plate right now, Jerome.

07:29.252 --> 07:32.258
But you're welcome
to come visit Randy

07:32.258 --> 07:34.889
anytime you'd like.

07:34.889 --> 07:36.601
‐

08:00.565 --> 08:02.861
‐ Why you slamming the door?

08:02.861 --> 08:05.575
‐ Hey, yo, shut up, son.

08:07.621 --> 08:12.965
‐ The stupid VCR
doesn't work again.

08:29.539 --> 08:31.126
Damn, Shotgun,
you killed this shit.

08:31.126 --> 08:33.212
Bobby came through
on this beat, son.

08:33.212 --> 08:34.465
Word up,
yeah, you know,

08:34.465 --> 08:36.177
Bobby got all the beats.

08:36.177 --> 08:37.764
You gonna call me,
superstar?

08:37.764 --> 08:39.308
Oh, you know I will.

08:39.308 --> 08:41.313
Better be the right number too.

08:41.313 --> 08:43.191
Catch you later.

08:43.191 --> 08:45.070
‐ A'ight, dog.

08:45.070 --> 08:46.281

08:46.281 --> 08:48.493
Love. Word up.
‐ Word.

08:48.493 --> 08:50.122
‐ Damn.

08:50.122 --> 08:52.209
This shit is still
in heavy rotation.

08:52.209 --> 08:53.796
You gonna give LL
a run for his money.

08:53.796 --> 08:55.884
‐ Shit, with the ladies too.

08:55.884 --> 08:57.386
Yo, I'm gonna call you

08:57.386 --> 08:59.642

08:59.642 --> 09:01.561
A'ight!

09:01.561 --> 09:03.023

09:03.023 --> 09:04.777
Yo, I told you
I was gonna be good.

09:04.777 --> 09:06.446
'Bout to get paid
with this rap shit.

09:06.446 --> 09:09.202
‐ Yeah, and when you do,
don't forget about your boy.

09:09.202 --> 09:11.749
You know I can't be doing
what I do forever.

09:11.749 --> 09:14.045
‐ Yo, when I blow up,
I'll take you with me, son.

09:14.045 --> 09:15.965
That's my word.
‐ That's my word.

09:15.965 --> 09:17.468
That's my word.

09:17.468 --> 09:18.930
A'ight, boy.

09:18.930 --> 09:20.850
Yo, yo, you got

09:20.850 --> 09:22.144
Damn.

09:22.144 --> 09:23.438
He got the whole
Killa Hill behind him.

09:23.438 --> 09:25.150
And that's a beautiful thing.

09:25.150 --> 09:26.821
I'ma need a dub of that shit
for the whip.

09:26.821 --> 09:28.658
Know what I'm saying?
‐ Yeah.

09:30.745 --> 09:31.914
‐ Say, let me get
a little crill

09:31.914 --> 09:33.125
and I'll get you back
by Friday, man.

09:33.125 --> 09:34.670
Come on.
Fuck outta here.

09:34.670 --> 09:36.464
You playing with us right now?
You think it's a fucking game?

09:36.464 --> 09:37.926
My son over here
talking to y'all

09:37.926 --> 09:39.638
about fucking layaways
and shit.

09:39.638 --> 09:40.890
What‐‐hold on,
hold on, hold on.

09:40.890 --> 09:43.061
Wait a second.
Take this scully shit, nigga.

09:43.061 --> 09:46.317
Get the fuck outta here, man!
Get the fuck outta here!

09:46.317 --> 09:48.656
What's wrong with these niggas?
‐ Leave that man alone!

09:48.656 --> 09:50.367
You never know
what someone's been through

09:50.367 --> 09:52.204
or where they come from.

09:52.204 --> 09:54.333
How dare y'all treat
another black man that way?

09:54.333 --> 09:55.670
‐ Let's get the fuck out
of here.

09:55.670 --> 09:58.843
You ought
to be ashamed of yourselves.

09:58.843 --> 10:00.805
‐ Afternoon, Ms. Burgess.

10:00.805 --> 10:03.059
You making magic quilts
up there again?

10:03.059 --> 10:05.189
‐ I wish they were magic.

10:05.189 --> 10:08.195
Might make more money
selling them if they had that.

10:08.195 --> 10:10.240
‐ My mother
still uses the quilt

10:10.240 --> 10:12.036
that you made for her
on her birthday

10:12.036 --> 10:13.748
with all the jazz musicians
on it.

10:13.748 --> 10:15.334
She says it keeps her mood up
in winter.

10:15.334 --> 10:16.712
Thank you.
‐ You're welcome.

10:16.712 --> 10:18.215
‐ You know what would
keep my mood up?

10:18.215 --> 10:19.467
‐ What?

10:19.467 --> 10:21.764
‐ If you told these boys
to act right.

10:23.601 --> 10:26.481
‐ Mm.
They listen to you.

10:26.481 --> 10:27.984
‐ Yes, ma'am.

10:27.984 --> 10:31.282
‐ Thank you.
You're welcome.

10:38.840 --> 10:40.092
I'm telling you,

10:40.092 --> 10:44.141
this world needs Nina today
more than ever.

10:44.141 --> 10:47.273
Curtis, remember that time
we saw her together

10:47.273 --> 10:49.570
at Washington Square Park
at the protest?

10:49.570 --> 10:51.030
Hmm.

10:51.030 --> 10:53.911
You whispered, "Don't look now,

10:53.911 --> 10:56.541
but Nina Simone
is right behind you."

10:56.541 --> 10:58.420
I thought you had
lost your mind.

10:58.420 --> 11:00.507
Then she turned around

11:00.507 --> 11:04.223
with that great big smile.

11:30.525 --> 11:31.695
Yo.

11:31.695 --> 11:33.365
‐ Hey, yo, what you doing

11:33.365 --> 11:34.743

11:43.009 --> 11:45.013
Fucking soundtrack to my life.

11:49.105 --> 11:50.900
‐ You good?

11:50.900 --> 11:52.570
‐ Yeah, I'm good, son.

11:52.570 --> 11:53.990
You a'ight?

11:53.990 --> 11:55.409
‐ Yeah, yeah, yeah.

11:55.409 --> 11:58.331
About to, uh, go over here
and handle some BI.

12:00.002 --> 12:02.297
I'ma catch you,

12:09.437 --> 12:11.399
It's fire, Shot.
It's real good.

12:31.982 --> 12:33.443
Yo.

12:41.710 --> 12:44.340
‐ You should
write that shit down.

12:44.340 --> 12:47.179
‐  You should have

12:47.179 --> 12:50.393
I been fucking flowing

12:50.393 --> 12:52.941
I feel like I'm already on

12:52.941 --> 12:54.485
‐ That shit's ill, right?

12:54.485 --> 12:57.199

12:57.199 --> 13:00.038
this parking lot today

Kids on the way to school

13:01.625 --> 13:04.171

they 8:15 bus.

13:04.171 --> 13:06.259
You know the fat little kid

13:07.971 --> 13:09.557
Shorty was bumping

13:09.557 --> 13:11.854
‐ The fuck is your ass

13:11.854 --> 13:15.903
‐ Look, man, they bump

13:22.541 --> 13:24.671
‐ You remind me

from The Pink Panther

13:24.671 --> 13:27.217
with the mustache

13:27.217 --> 13:30.515

This nigga crazy.

13:30.515 --> 13:32.687

You sell that shit?

13:34.273 --> 13:37.112
‐ Listen, man, it's too cold
to be standing outside

13:37.112 --> 13:39.033

13:39.033 --> 13:41.078
‐ Yo, you told me
that you was gon' sell
that shit for me.

13:41.078 --> 13:42.289
No, no, no.

13:42.289 --> 13:45.211
You asked me
if I could sell it for you.

13:45.211 --> 13:48.092
And I will, eventually.

13:50.138 --> 13:51.600
‐ A'ight, man.

13:51.600 --> 13:54.146
Let me see how much you got.

‐ Fuck it.
‐ Yo, what's good?

14:14.813 --> 14:17.568
‐ Fuck it, man.
I gotta bounce, all right?

14:17.568 --> 14:20.783
‐ Yo, Bobby, what's up
with that track, though, man?

14:27.797 --> 14:31.012
Hey, Ma.

14:31.012 --> 14:33.976
Hey, uh, a little short today,

14:33.976 --> 14:35.813
but, uh...

14:40.906 --> 14:43.411
‐ Well, we're good.

14:43.411 --> 14:45.123
Oh, yeah?

14:45.123 --> 14:47.044
How is that?

14:47.044 --> 14:49.256
‐ Well, thank God
I got a lot of good tips.

14:53.222 --> 14:55.351
‐

14:59.944 --> 15:03.493
What is that, a apple?
‐ Nah, I'm using it for Mars.

15:03.493 --> 15:05.581
What's that,
the solar system?

15:05.581 --> 15:09.338
Yeah, it's a project
for science class.

15:09.338 --> 15:11.802
‐ Jerome is out?
‐ Mm‐hmm.

15:11.802 --> 15:13.889
Showed up on my doorstep
like a lost puppy.

15:13.889 --> 15:16.435
But Randy's happy
to see his daddy.

15:16.435 --> 15:18.272
‐ What, is he staying here?

15:18.272 --> 15:19.651
‐ Uh, no.

15:22.239 --> 15:24.493
‐ Bobby!
‐ Yo.

15:24.493 --> 15:27.374
‐ It's been a long time.
‐ Sure has.

15:27.374 --> 15:30.631
Welcome back.
‐ I'm just glad to be home.

15:30.631 --> 15:31.800
‐ I'll bet.

15:31.800 --> 15:32.885
So I guess
with Divine's situation,

15:32.885 --> 15:35.557
you the man
of the house now, huh?

15:35.557 --> 15:36.810
‐ Yeah.

15:36.810 --> 15:38.897
I mean, it's good to have
a extra set of hands

15:38.897 --> 15:41.527
around the house, though,
you know what I'm saying?

15:45.995 --> 15:47.623
‐ Can I please use your phone?

15:47.623 --> 15:49.126
‐ Is it a local call?

15:50.963 --> 15:52.382
‐ C'mon, now, I told you

15:52.382 --> 15:54.637
I'm trying
to get this land deal.

15:56.933 --> 16:00.398
‐ Go on.
All right, all right.

16:04.657 --> 16:07.412
‐ "Land deal"?

16:07.412 --> 16:09.751
‐  You don't
have to worry, Bobby.

16:09.751 --> 16:11.838
We got this week's payment.

16:16.013 --> 16:17.934
‐ All right.

16:17.934 --> 16:20.230
Hey, but, Ma?

16:20.230 --> 16:22.484
We still got the rest, though.

16:51.333 --> 16:53.462
‐ You're short.

16:53.462 --> 16:55.133
‐ It's all there.

16:55.133 --> 16:56.761
‐ You pay late,
you owe a little more.

16:56.761 --> 16:58.389
It's called interest.

16:58.389 --> 17:00.894
And if you don't make it right,
I can't promise you

17:00.894 --> 17:03.441
that Patxi will be
on his best behavior.

17:05.570 --> 17:08.284
‐ Maybe you could talk to him
for me.

17:10.873 --> 17:12.250
Larry.

17:15.758 --> 17:18.387
‐ You should finish...

17:18.387 --> 17:20.433
polishing that silverware.

17:35.463 --> 17:38.302
‐ Better hurry if you want to
get to school on time, Shurrie.

17:38.302 --> 17:40.431
‐ I know.

17:43.020 --> 17:44.649
Like that?
Yeah, good.

17:44.649 --> 17:46.318
That's very good.

17:46.318 --> 17:47.947
Really, Jerome?

17:49.909 --> 17:51.078
Want some
hot chocolate?

17:51.078 --> 17:52.539
I got extra whipped cream.

17:52.539 --> 17:55.002
Randy is supposed
to be in school.

17:55.002 --> 17:57.633
His science project is due.

17:57.633 --> 17:59.177
"Science project"?

17:59.177 --> 18:00.973
Looks more like a fruit salad
to me.

18:00.973 --> 18:03.436
‐

18:03.436 --> 18:06.233
Oh, you ain't changed
a bit, little lady.

18:06.233 --> 18:09.699
Always about them books
and so serious.

18:09.699 --> 18:11.578
You need to enjoy being a kid.

18:11.578 --> 18:13.456
‐ I'm not a kid.

18:13.456 --> 18:16.211
‐ Well, maybe that's
your problem.

18:16.211 --> 18:19.259
Always so busy acting grown
when you ain't.

18:19.259 --> 18:22.098
You gonna look up one day
and be an old lady

18:22.098 --> 18:25.354
sitting in a rocking chair,
petting a cat,

18:25.354 --> 18:26.941
wondering
what the hell happened.

18:26.941 --> 18:30.031
‐ She's allergic
to cats, Daddy.

18:30.031 --> 18:32.661
I'm the one
that makes sure
his homework is done.

18:32.661 --> 18:36.126
I'm the one that gets him
to school on time every day.

18:36.126 --> 18:37.963
Where have you been?

18:37.963 --> 18:40.051
Listen...

18:40.051 --> 18:43.349
I just want to spend some time
with my little boy.

18:43.349 --> 18:44.769
And on the real?

18:44.769 --> 18:47.650
He can learn more
from his father about life

18:47.650 --> 18:49.946
than in some
overcrowded classroom.

18:51.991 --> 18:54.664
‐ Oh, Daddy showed me how
to make a card disappear.

18:54.664 --> 18:57.293
Wanna see?
‐ You gotta watch this.

18:57.293 --> 18:59.715
Go ahead, man, go ahead.

19:04.516 --> 19:07.773
Hey, yo, I'm 'bout
to MacGyver this shit, son!

19:18.920 --> 19:22.260
Man, this shit shouldn't be
this fucking hard, yo.

19:22.260 --> 19:25.391
‐ It's not that hard
for Shurrie.

19:25.391 --> 19:28.773
She fixed it in two minutes.

19:28.773 --> 19:31.236
‐ Hey, yo,
that ain't helpful, D.

19:37.123 --> 19:39.377
You asked me
to hold those tape for you.

19:39.377 --> 19:42.008
I hold them, but not forever.

19:42.008 --> 19:43.845
‐ I understand
what you're saying, I do.

19:43.845 --> 19:45.891
All I'm asking for
is one more week.

19:45.891 --> 19:47.101
Money is tight right now.

19:47.101 --> 19:48.813
Just one more week
and I got you.

19:48.813 --> 19:51.401
‐ Can't make no promises.

20:01.546 --> 20:04.971
‐ Hey, what's up with that?

20:04.971 --> 20:07.893
‐ Them white boys
want ganja bad enough,

20:07.893 --> 20:10.314
they come to this side of town.

20:15.617 --> 20:18.080
‐

20:25.762 --> 20:28.768
‐ Man, why you ignoring
your shit?

20:37.493 --> 20:39.957
‐

20:39.957 --> 20:41.501
Hey, yo, what up?

20:43.338 --> 20:45.677
"Easy money"?

20:45.677 --> 20:49.267
Shit, I'm down for anything
easy right now, nigga.

20:50.937 --> 20:53.233
Hey, yo, I don't know
about this shit, son.

20:53.233 --> 20:55.362
That's like the whitest
fucking burger joint

20:55.362 --> 20:56.616
in the whole borough.

20:56.616 --> 20:58.703
This shit called "White's."

20:58.703 --> 21:01.918
They all probably, like,
cops' kids and shit.

21:01.918 --> 21:03.922
‐ Yeah, exactly.

21:03.922 --> 21:06.844
So the cops won't be
sweating us, nigga.

21:06.844 --> 21:09.140
Yo, this is our only option.

21:09.140 --> 21:11.311
We can sell to them
Wall Street motherfuckers,

21:11.311 --> 21:14.777
or we could sell to these
burger‐eating bums.

21:14.777 --> 21:17.365
‐
‐ A'ight?

21:41.664 --> 21:43.375
‐

21:56.944 --> 21:58.530
Hey, what caused that face?

21:58.530 --> 22:01.453
‐ Shut up.
Why you even here?

22:01.453 --> 22:03.958
‐ Yo, can't a brother visit
his favorite sister?

22:03.958 --> 22:05.879
‐
Whatever.

22:08.635 --> 22:11.599
Nah, for real,
what's wrong with you?

22:11.599 --> 22:14.855
‐
Damn Jerome.

22:14.855 --> 22:18.487
Coming in here like we supposed
to bow down to him and shit.

22:18.487 --> 22:20.532
He made Randy skip school today

22:20.532 --> 22:22.328
and his big science project
was due.

22:24.875 --> 22:27.673
‐ Look, when you get out
of jail,

22:27.673 --> 22:31.722
you feel like the entire world
has moved on without you,

22:31.722 --> 22:35.145
and all you trying to do
is catch up with it.

22:35.145 --> 22:38.360
And I know how Jerome can be,
but honestly, yo,

22:38.360 --> 22:41.533
if I was Randy and I had a day
to hang out with my pops

22:41.533 --> 22:45.082
who I never see
instead of going to school,

22:45.082 --> 22:47.253
I'm gon' take that any day.

22:47.253 --> 22:49.215
Even if pops wasn't a saint.

22:49.215 --> 22:51.303
I mean,
at least Jerome showed up.

22:51.303 --> 22:53.140
More than you can say
for our dad.

22:53.140 --> 22:55.436
‐ Yeah, yeah.

22:58.191 --> 23:01.031
‐ You holding it down,
little mama.

23:07.711 --> 23:08.921
Hello?

23:08.921 --> 23:11.844
What up, Rico?
It's Vine.

23:11.844 --> 23:14.140
Mm‐hmm.
I got that stuff for you.

23:16.227 --> 23:18.023
Yeah, all right.

23:18.023 --> 23:20.319
Yeah, yeah, yeah, uh‐huh.
I got you.

23:20.319 --> 23:22.114
I'll come by tomorrow morning.

23:24.535 --> 23:27.124
‐
Yo, you was right, son.

23:27.124 --> 23:29.880
This shit is easier
than the park.

23:29.880 --> 23:32.426
‐ Hey, you ever
had that before?

23:32.426 --> 23:33.721
‐ Nah, nigga.

23:33.721 --> 23:35.767
This the only cream I like.

23:35.767 --> 23:38.230
‐
Shit.

23:41.779 --> 23:43.950
So, uh...

23:43.950 --> 23:46.204
you like hip‐hop?

23:46.204 --> 23:48.709
‐ Like Beastie Boys and shit?

23:48.709 --> 23:51.339
‐ Yeah, sort of.

23:51.339 --> 23:52.717
Sort of.

23:54.596 --> 23:57.936
Anybody ever tell you
you look like Debbie Harry?

23:57.936 --> 24:00.859
‐ You know Blondie?
Oh, yeah, baby.

24:00.859 --> 24:04.115
Blondie, the Ramones.

24:04.115 --> 24:07.079
Shit, I even be at CBGB's
sometimes, you feel me?

24:07.079 --> 24:09.250
‐ Hey, yo, what the fuck
are y'all talking about?

24:09.250 --> 24:11.839
‐ Hey.
Didn't you see the sign?

24:11.839 --> 24:13.383
It says "White's."

24:13.383 --> 24:15.137
Aren't you a little dark
to be sitting here?

24:15.137 --> 24:16.849
‐ Oh, hell, nah.

24:16.849 --> 24:18.560
You darkies
hard of hearing?

24:18.560 --> 24:20.773
Nah, I heard
what the fuck you said.

24:59.851 --> 25:01.229
Yo!

25:19.850 --> 25:22.563
‐ Looks like you missed one.

25:24.860 --> 25:27.907
You know, they say
spilled salt is bad luck.

25:29.786 --> 25:33.001
Looks like you got
some cleaning up to do.

25:37.551 --> 25:40.600
If I don't have the rest
of my money by tomorrow,

25:40.600 --> 25:43.396
you're gonna have
some very bad luck.

25:43.396 --> 25:45.777
You understand?

26:03.688 --> 26:05.190
‐

26:07.821 --> 26:10.158
Yeah,
I'm kinda dizzy, nigga,

26:10.158 --> 26:12.580
but I don't need
no fucking stitches.

26:12.580 --> 26:14.793
Man, you don't
need no stitches.

26:14.793 --> 26:17.172
You need
a fucking sewing machine

26:17.172 --> 26:18.884
or a zipper
or some shit.

26:20.680 --> 26:22.809
‐ Goddamn, son.

26:22.809 --> 26:24.353
‐ Shit's bad?

26:24.353 --> 26:26.775
‐ Yeah, that shit
don't look good.

26:30.031 --> 26:31.577
Hey, yo, I need you
to take this money

26:31.577 --> 26:33.496
to my moms, all right?

26:37.171 --> 26:39.467
‐ Hey, yo, you gonna be good
in there?

26:39.467 --> 26:41.471
‐ Yeah.

26:41.471 --> 26:43.893
A'ight, later.

26:43.893 --> 26:45.562
‐

26:48.193 --> 26:49.654
Hey, yo.

26:49.654 --> 26:52.869
I loved you
in the Thriller video, though.

26:52.869 --> 26:55.833
‐ Ah, fuck you.

27:05.560 --> 27:08.609
‐ Hey, Miss Diggs.
Hey, Dennis.

27:08.609 --> 27:11.239
Where's Bobby?
I been paging him all night.

27:11.239 --> 27:12.617
He hasn't called me back.

27:12.617 --> 27:15.247
Um, yeah, I was just
with him at the hospital.

27:15.247 --> 27:17.376
He okay.
Nah, he‐‐he good.

27:17.376 --> 27:20.006
He just, um‐‐he just slipped
on some ice.

27:20.006 --> 27:21.467
Yeah, I had to take him
to the ER

27:21.467 --> 27:22.762
and get stitched up.

27:22.762 --> 27:25.016
He wanted me
to give you this, though.

27:30.903 --> 27:32.740
‐ Is this it?

27:32.740 --> 27:35.120
‐ Yeah.

27:35.120 --> 27:37.750
‐ Well, there's, um,
some dinner in the fridge

27:37.750 --> 27:39.378
if you're hungry.

27:39.378 --> 27:42.175
‐ No, I'm okay, thank you.

27:42.175 --> 27:44.430
Hey, you‐‐you good?
Yeah.

27:44.430 --> 27:46.935
Just have to run a errand
real quick.

27:52.154 --> 27:54.618
‐

27:56.245 --> 27:57.832
‐ Hey.

27:57.832 --> 28:01.339
‐ Hey, I was just leaving.

28:01.339 --> 28:03.176
What's up with you?

28:05.013 --> 28:06.600
‐ Nothing.

28:06.600 --> 28:08.311
‐ Where have you been?

28:08.311 --> 28:10.733
You haven't answered
any of my pages.

28:12.737 --> 28:15.743
What did I do?

28:15.743 --> 28:18.582
‐ You don't get it.
Get what?

28:18.582 --> 28:22.047
Is there another girl
or something?

28:25.428 --> 28:27.349
‐

28:27.349 --> 28:31.065
Ain't shit gon' change, Rie.

28:31.065 --> 28:34.656
My brothers
is always gon' be my brothers.

28:34.656 --> 28:36.534
They always gon' be
asking me for shit.

28:36.534 --> 28:38.454
And my moms, she‐‐

28:38.454 --> 28:40.918
she sure as hell
ain't gon' stop drinking,

28:40.918 --> 28:43.131
no matter how bad it gets.

28:43.131 --> 28:46.805
And all that falling on me,
I‐I don't want that for you.

28:46.805 --> 28:49.017
‐ That's not for you to decide.

28:49.017 --> 28:51.732
‐ A'ight, well, what the hell
your family gon' think?

28:51.732 --> 28:54.946
‐ My family?
My brother is friends with you.

28:54.946 --> 28:57.451
My mama always offers
to feed you.

28:57.451 --> 28:59.079
I'm tired of everybody thinking

28:59.079 --> 29:00.708
that they know
what's best for me.

29:00.708 --> 29:02.837
I'm not some little girl.

29:02.837 --> 29:05.801
I'm almost a grown woman,
and I know what I want.

29:19.536 --> 29:21.248
Um...

29:21.248 --> 29:23.294
Why that look?

29:23.294 --> 29:25.925
‐ I forgot
I got my sleep wrap on

29:25.925 --> 29:28.972
and I probably look crazy.

29:28.972 --> 29:30.558
The only thing that's crazy

29:30.558 --> 29:32.688
is how much
I'm feeling you right now.

29:59.909 --> 30:02.915
‐ 2‐1‐0.

30:02.915 --> 30:04.627
Straight.

30:04.627 --> 30:06.255
‐ Here you go.

30:06.255 --> 30:08.259
Winning numbers
announced tomorrow.

30:17.277 --> 30:18.655
‐ Is your mom
still mad at me

30:18.655 --> 30:20.116
for taking you out of school
and all that?

30:20.116 --> 30:21.870
She ain't called me back yet.

30:21.870 --> 30:25.251
‐ I don't know.

30:25.251 --> 30:27.882
‐ Maybe she just got
a boyfriend or something.

30:30.596 --> 30:32.432
Does your mom have a boyfriend?

30:32.432 --> 30:34.394
‐
Ew, no.

30:36.482 --> 30:38.319
‐ Ain't nothing wrong with
being somebody's boyfriend.

30:38.319 --> 30:40.156
You gon' be some girl's
boyfriend someday.

30:40.156 --> 30:42.202
‐ When I'm a running back,
right?

30:42.202 --> 30:44.247
‐
Something like that.

30:45.918 --> 30:48.590
So no dudes
coming by the house?

30:48.590 --> 30:51.470
‐ Larry came by the house once.

30:51.470 --> 30:53.057
‐ Fat Larry?

30:53.057 --> 30:54.811
‐ And his friends.

30:56.522 --> 30:58.860
What do you mean,
"and his friends"?

30:58.860 --> 31:01.281
Like I hang out
with DeShon and Christian.

31:01.281 --> 31:04.580
Fat Larry
has two best friends too.

31:04.580 --> 31:07.712
‐ They talk about anything
I should know about?

31:07.712 --> 31:11.176
‐ I don't know,
Mama sent me to my room.

31:11.176 --> 31:13.598
When Larry left,
she looked sad,

31:13.598 --> 31:17.147
so I don't think her
and Larry are friends anymore.

31:20.361 --> 31:22.742
‐ All right.

31:24.746 --> 31:27.125
‐
Man, hurry up.

31:27.125 --> 31:28.837
Why you trying
to resuscitate this shit

31:28.837 --> 31:30.591
like it's a crash victim
or something?

31:30.591 --> 31:32.469
'Cause your shit's dusty.

31:32.469 --> 31:35.516
This shit would never fly
in the military.

31:35.516 --> 31:38.857
I'd be over in Desert Storm
right now if I could.

31:38.857 --> 31:41.195
‐
Fuck that.

31:41.195 --> 31:43.199
That's what I'm saying.

31:43.199 --> 31:45.203
Why would you go
to a foreign place

31:45.203 --> 31:47.750
just to risk getting shot at
for nothing?

31:47.750 --> 31:49.629
‐ It is for something, fool.

31:49.629 --> 31:51.548
See, when you're a soldier,
you a part of something

31:51.548 --> 31:53.845
bigger than yourself.

31:53.845 --> 31:55.348
You know, when I was stationed
in Germany,

31:55.348 --> 31:58.020
when the wall came down,
all those folks over there‐‐

31:58.020 --> 31:59.523
east side, west side‐‐

31:59.523 --> 32:01.026
they all just wanted
to be together.

32:01.026 --> 32:03.280
They didn't want
that damn wall.

32:03.280 --> 32:05.076
It's always
the motherfuckers in power

32:05.076 --> 32:06.579
that wanna keep shit apart.

32:06.579 --> 32:09.459
That wanna control shit.

32:09.459 --> 32:12.048
‐ But, son, ain't no
black people in Germany.

32:12.048 --> 32:14.637
‐
They love us there.

32:14.637 --> 32:17.058
I'd walk into a pub
and the white folks over there

32:17.058 --> 32:19.062
would buy me
pints of beer and shit.

32:19.062 --> 32:21.609
‐
‐ I'm going back one day.

32:21.609 --> 32:23.445
Shit, maybe I'll stay.

32:23.445 --> 32:26.410
‐ Sound like you had a few
pints to the head already.

32:26.410 --> 32:27.495
Talking about going to live

32:27.495 --> 32:28.957
with these white folks
and shit.

32:28.957 --> 32:31.796
Son, that's like a lion saying
he gon' leave his own land

32:31.796 --> 32:34.176
and putting hisself in a cage
at a zoo.

32:34.176 --> 32:36.138
‐ And I'ma still be king
of the jungle.

32:36.138 --> 32:37.307
‐
Whatever.

32:37.307 --> 32:39.519
‐ Pick up your sticks.
‐

32:39.519 --> 32:41.566
Know you not fucking with me
in this, right?

32:41.566 --> 32:43.068
‐ Yeah, we'll see about that.

32:43.068 --> 32:45.489
Man, y'all niggas
both ain't shit.

32:45.489 --> 32:48.037
Whatever, nigga.

33:04.904 --> 33:06.490
What it is, what it is.

33:06.490 --> 33:09.537
Gentlemen, I'll see you.

33:09.537 --> 33:11.375
Hey, Miss Diggs.

33:11.375 --> 33:13.922
Good to see you, Steven.

33:13.922 --> 33:15.341
How's your mother?

33:15.341 --> 33:16.761
‐ Oh, she's still
got the arthritis,

33:16.761 --> 33:18.807
but she's handling it.

33:21.311 --> 33:24.109
‐ Well, give her my best.

33:24.109 --> 33:26.071
Yes, ma'am.

33:33.127 --> 33:34.546
‐ Afternoon, sweetheart.

33:34.546 --> 33:36.968
Have a fine day.

33:46.111 --> 33:47.280
Takes a lot of money,

33:47.280 --> 33:49.242
so I'm glad
this is all cleared up.

33:49.242 --> 33:51.288
Sure you are.

33:53.167 --> 33:54.795
Jerome?

33:59.262 --> 34:01.016
Did you pay them?

34:01.016 --> 34:03.228
‐ Told you I wasn't
messing around.

34:08.197 --> 34:11.036
Larry, we good?

34:13.666 --> 34:15.460
Thank you, Jerome.

34:15.460 --> 34:19.552
I, uh‐‐I really don't know
what to say.

34:19.552 --> 34:21.681
‐ It ain't about thanking me.

34:23.185 --> 34:25.481
Listen, I know in the past,

34:25.481 --> 34:28.404
I've made promises to you.

34:30.491 --> 34:32.286
But if you can just trust me
one more time,

34:32.286 --> 34:35.877
I promise you, you'll have
everything you ever wanted.

34:35.877 --> 34:38.090
That company called me today.

34:40.637 --> 34:42.514
They gon' buy my land.

34:42.514 --> 34:44.603
‐ Mm.

34:44.603 --> 34:46.565
‐ They really gon' buy it.

34:46.565 --> 34:49.362
‐ Okay.

34:49.362 --> 34:52.118
What are you doing?

34:52.118 --> 34:53.454
‐ I'm not gonna move
another inch

34:53.454 --> 34:55.958
until I hear you say...

34:55.958 --> 34:57.545
you trust me.

34:59.633 --> 35:02.221
‐

35:02.221 --> 35:04.267
Okay, you've been spending
too much time with Randy.

35:04.267 --> 35:05.561
Come on, now.

35:12.492 --> 35:14.120
Okay, okay, I trust you.

35:14.120 --> 35:17.126
‐ That's what I'm saying!
‐

35:21.636 --> 35:23.514
‐ I'll see you later.

35:41.049 --> 35:43.011
‐

35:44.807 --> 35:46.226
Yeah?

35:46.226 --> 35:48.815
‐ Yo, where Rico at?
Who you?

35:48.815 --> 35:51.111
‐ I got something for him.

35:51.111 --> 35:53.156
I talked to him last night.

35:53.156 --> 35:55.369
Yo, he got picked up
by his PO this morning.

35:55.369 --> 35:57.708
You ain't gon' be seeing him
for a hot minute.

36:23.635 --> 36:25.680
They could be
in position to prevent tankers

36:25.680 --> 36:26.933
from hauling Iraqi...

36:30.564 --> 36:31.943
Transported
by pipeline

36:31.943 --> 36:33.821
through Saudi Arabia.

36:33.821 --> 36:35.992
Pentagon sources say
a number of Navy SEALs

36:35.992 --> 36:39.917
and other special operation
forces are already involved.

36:39.917 --> 36:42.546
We do know that there
is considerably increased

36:42.546 --> 36:44.342
air activity in Saudi Arabia.

36:44.342 --> 36:45.845
Pentagon‐‐

36:48.558 --> 36:51.564
‐ Move away from my window
with all this mess!

36:51.564 --> 36:53.778
Don't nobody wanna hear
all that kind of talk.

36:53.778 --> 36:55.114
What?

36:55.114 --> 36:57.201
‐ You ought to be ashamed
of yourselves.

36:57.201 --> 37:00.374
‐ Miss B, mind your business
before you get told some shit.

37:00.374 --> 37:02.044
Some real shit.

37:02.044 --> 37:05.217
"Miss B"
stands for "biatch"!

37:06.887 --> 37:08.473
You need to get down
with this shit

37:08.473 --> 37:09.893
before your old ass
get left behind.

37:11.396 --> 37:14.444
Yo, you need to get
with this rap movement, bitch.

37:14.444 --> 37:17.116
‐ You call this a movement?

37:17.116 --> 37:18.619
Have you ever had to fight

37:18.619 --> 37:21.792
for something bigger
than yourselves?

37:21.792 --> 37:23.253
For your freedom?

37:23.253 --> 37:26.176
For your right to exist?

37:26.176 --> 37:28.639
Y'all out here battling
over who got the block.

37:28.639 --> 37:32.480
The best shoes,
the gold chains.

37:32.480 --> 37:35.319
But the reason you have
the freedom to stand there

37:35.319 --> 37:37.908
and want those things
is because people like me

37:37.908 --> 37:41.081
and my husband stood out
in the cold just like this

37:41.081 --> 37:43.543
so you could have
the equal education.

37:43.543 --> 37:45.422
The equal rights.

37:47.093 --> 37:51.685
The women who led this movement
risked their lives

37:51.685 --> 37:54.065
not so you could
stand next to my window

37:54.065 --> 37:57.029
and call them "bitches"
and "hoes."

37:58.574 --> 38:00.620
A real man?

38:00.620 --> 38:03.835
A man like my husband, Curtis?

38:03.835 --> 38:07.676
He called a woman
who stood by him his queen.

38:07.676 --> 38:09.303
His rock.

38:12.518 --> 38:14.230
‐ Take this rock, bitch!

38:15.692 --> 38:17.069
Oh!

38:17.069 --> 38:18.656
You gon' hit her shit,
my nigga!

38:18.656 --> 38:19.658
Oh!

38:19.658 --> 38:21.996
‐

38:31.682 --> 38:34.688
‐ Yes, I need you
to send the police.

39:04.998 --> 39:06.585
Come on, get in on this, Sha!

39:06.585 --> 39:08.171
‐ Nah, I'm good, son.
‐ Man, leave him be.

39:08.171 --> 39:10.802
He don't rap no more.

39:27.042 --> 39:29.171
Bitch.

40:34.594 --> 40:35.721
‐

40:47.286 --> 40:48.581
‐ Divine.

40:48.581 --> 40:49.958
Hey, I need
to stash some shit, baby‐‐

40:49.958 --> 40:51.587
‐ No, you ain't keeping shit
up in here.

40:51.587 --> 40:53.047
You getting cuffed again,
Divine?

40:53.047 --> 40:54.300
Don't have time to explain‐‐

40:54.300 --> 40:56.512
‐ I don't have time to listen.
‐ Wait, come on.

40:56.512 --> 40:58.642
Shit.

41:11.793 --> 41:13.672
You in a hurry?
No, sir.

41:13.672 --> 41:15.383
Places to go.
Late for work.

41:15.383 --> 41:17.889
Turn around.
Let me check your pockets.

41:23.776 --> 41:25.237
We ain't even
doing nothing but rhyming.

41:25.237 --> 41:26.740
Shit.
‐ We got a noise complaint.

41:26.740 --> 41:28.577
It's just music, man.
Fuck.

41:28.577 --> 41:29.704
Back up
out of the circle

41:29.704 --> 41:31.123
so I can see everyone's hands.

41:31.123 --> 41:33.002
Oh, you scared
about some niggas in a circle?

41:33.002 --> 41:34.213
What you think we doing,
officers?

41:34.213 --> 41:37.010
Step out of the circle, now.

41:41.227 --> 41:42.855
Yo.

41:42.855 --> 41:45.235
Yo, just back up
and do what they say.

41:47.114 --> 41:49.326
‐ It ain't gonna help nothing
if y'all not cooperating.

41:51.247 --> 41:53.209
‐ Come on, just do it.

41:53.209 --> 41:56.257
Y'all gon' make it harder
for everybody else.

41:56.257 --> 41:59.179
Y'all ain't do nothing,
so act like it and save face!

41:59.179 --> 42:00.975
A'ight.
Watch your hands.

42:00.975 --> 42:02.812
Line up, line up.

42:02.812 --> 42:04.816
Turn that shit off.

42:04.816 --> 42:06.945
‐ Hey, my man, I got this.
‐ No, you don't got this.

42:06.945 --> 42:09.826
This is all me.
Line the fuck up!

42:09.826 --> 42:11.120
How many times
we gotta tell you?

42:11.120 --> 42:12.749
Line up.

42:12.749 --> 42:14.836
‐ Who you raising up on, nigga?

42:14.836 --> 42:16.047
‐ Only nigga I see here is you.

42:16.047 --> 42:18.217
You don't run these streets,
you hear me?

42:18.217 --> 42:20.388
Line the fuck up!

42:20.388 --> 42:22.810
‐ What you flexing for, anyway?

42:22.810 --> 42:24.939
These dudes are rapping.

42:24.939 --> 42:26.860
There's no crimes going on,
Officer.

42:26.860 --> 42:29.406
Fuck you,
motherfucker!

42:29.406 --> 42:30.743
Bitch‐ass nigga!

42:32.997 --> 42:34.541
Hey, you.

42:34.541 --> 42:35.711
‐

42:41.765 --> 42:44.436
You ain't shit.
You know that, right?

42:47.442 --> 42:49.113
‐ You arresting me?

42:51.492 --> 42:55.500
Fuck you, you corny‐ass,
wannabe‐bad Uncle Tom.

42:59.383 --> 43:00.803
You hiding in a uniform,

43:00.803 --> 43:02.890
but the only real soldier
standing here is me.

43:02.890 --> 43:03.892
Yeah.

43:05.311 --> 43:07.650
‐ Officer.

43:07.650 --> 43:09.654
Yo, y'all good.

43:11.198 --> 43:12.785
Yo! Yo!

43:12.785 --> 43:14.496
‐ Yo, what the...

43:16.585 --> 43:18.630
Yo, get his bitch ass!

43:18.630 --> 43:20.049
Yeah!

43:34.369 --> 43:35.581
Haze!

43:37.125 --> 43:39.714
‐ Throw his ass
to the ground, Haze!

43:39.714 --> 43:42.302
‐ Let him go, motherfucker!

43:43.847 --> 43:46.393
Yo, yo!
Shit, what the...

43:48.397 --> 43:51.028
What you gotta say now?

43:51.028 --> 43:53.407
‐ Yo, he can't breathe!

43:53.407 --> 43:56.957
‐ What you gotta say now?

43:56.957 --> 43:58.376
‐ Yo, let him out!

43:58.376 --> 43:59.671
Somebody help him!

44:03.094 --> 44:05.223
‐ What you gotta say now?

44:05.223 --> 44:06.852
I run these streets!

44:06.852 --> 44:09.941
Hey, let him go!

44:09.941 --> 44:12.112
What the fuck?

44:16.078 --> 44:18.457
‐ What you gotta say now, huh?

44:22.173 --> 44:24.344
‐ Say something!

44:24.344 --> 44:27.475
‐ He's fucking dead‐‐
‐ He's not‐‐he's not moving!

44:27.475 --> 44:29.856
Hey, get the fuck off him!

44:34.406 --> 44:37.078
Yo, you fucking

44:38.999 --> 44:42.882
Yo, he's not moving!

44:42.882 --> 44:44.426
Come on, get off me!

44:44.426 --> 44:46.472
Get the fuck off me!

45:13.275 --> 45:15.990
Haze!

45:15.990 --> 45:17.868
Wake up, Haze!
No!

45:17.868 --> 45:21.000
What y'all do that for?

45:21.000 --> 45:24.256
