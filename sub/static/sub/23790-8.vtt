-But isn't he supposed to die at the end?

03:08.563 --> 03:10.982

of shape-shifting gas

03:11.065 --> 03:12.692

Bad ass.

15:18.918 --> 15:21.003
Uh, Emaline, I got you a Mountain Dew.

15:21.086 --> 15:22.171
No, thanks.

15:22.254 --> 15:25.257
I was wondering if you wanted
to watch television with me in my room.

15:25.883 --> 15:27.509
Go beat off into a sock.

15:38.270 --> 15:41.023
Dude, I found a game room.
Want to play ping-pong?

15:41.106 --> 15:43.734
-Play with yourself.
-[laughs] Yeah, good one.

15:51.492 --> 15:53.035
I'll play if you want.

15:53.118 --> 15:54.453
Are you any good?

15:54.870 --> 15:56.664
Hmm. Not really.

16:40.708 --> 16:41.875
A pit stop.

16:44.461 --> 16:47.673
I was thinking about what you said
the night we went to see Tori Amos.

16:47.756 --> 16:51.385
Oh, I think we both said
some things I'd rather forget.

16:52.886 --> 16:55.806
I mean, about your dad.

16:56.807 --> 16:58.600
You said you wished you knew him better.

17:01.020 --> 17:04.398

Hey, little man.

19:09.773 --> 19:12.276
You, uh, need some help?

19:15.529 --> 19:19.366

-Drive.

19:46.059 --> 19:47.811
-Are you okay?
-Just drive.

20:44.409 --> 20:47.120
Wait. Luke, you can talk to me, you know.
What happened?

20:47.204 --> 20:49.248
-Nothing happened.
-This is not nothing.

20:49.331 --> 20:54.294
Fine. I was right. My dad's an asshole.
Thank you for the confirmation.

20:54.378 --> 20:56.922
-What did he say?
-I just want to go to bed, Kate.

20:57.005 --> 20:59.633
-Luke, talk to me, please.
-It's kind of amazing.

20:59.716 --> 21:01.426
You're not my girlfriend,

21:01.510 --> 21:03.929
and yet you keep finding new ways
to break my heart.

21:04.513 --> 21:07.224
You wanna help?
You can start by leaving me alone.
