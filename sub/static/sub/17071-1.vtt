We moved to America,
and we made it.

19:33.706 --> 19:35.475
We are
the success story.

19:35.508 --> 19:37.710
I guess we are.

19:37.744 --> 19:39.712
I mean,
we did fly economy plus.

19:39.746 --> 19:42.081
Besides, no one loves America
more than you.

19:42.114 --> 19:43.716
As soon as
we moved back here,

19:43.750 --> 19:45.051
you would miss it
over there.

19:45.084 --> 19:46.686
And as soon
as we go back there,

19:46.719 --> 19:48.187
you know
you're gonna miss it here.

19:48.221 --> 19:50.990
Well, maybe we'll never
feel completely at home

19:51.023 --> 19:52.058
in either place.

19:53.760 --> 19:55.928
Oh, my God.

19:55.962 --> 19:57.597
We are "Ghost."

19:58.865 --> 20:01.200
We are Patrick Swayze
in "Ghost."

20:01.234 --> 20:03.770
Stuck between two worlds,
part of both,

20:03.803 --> 20:05.372
belonging to neither.

20:05.405 --> 20:08.408
Damn it.

20:08.441 --> 20:10.877
It is
the best movie ever.

20:10.910 --> 20:12.412
Mm-hmm.

20:12.445 --> 20:13.246
[ Door buzzer ]
[ Horn honks ]

20:15.315 --> 20:19.719
Hey. I am so sorry
for how I behaved, Gene.

20:19.752 --> 20:21.288
I really am happy
for you,

20:21.321 --> 20:24.791
for the life you've made here
for yourself.

20:27.294 --> 20:32.064
"Wishing you a lifetime
of only...happiness."

20:32.098 --> 20:33.466
[ Chuckles ]
That's what I thought

20:33.500 --> 20:35.468
it was gonna say
the first time.

20:35.502 --> 20:37.370
That's why
I was so shocked.

20:37.404 --> 20:39.472
Well, I'm glad I got to be here
for your special day.

20:39.506 --> 20:41.274
Me, too.
We shouldn't wait
another 10 years

20:41.308 --> 20:42.775
before we see
each other again.

20:42.809 --> 20:44.277
Well, I have a flight
through Orlando next week.

20:44.311 --> 20:45.912
That's a little too soon.

20:45.945 --> 20:47.480
Ready to head
to the airport?

20:47.514 --> 20:49.282
We're not leaving
until tomorrow.

20:49.316 --> 20:50.883
I still think we should
head out now, though.

20:50.917 --> 20:51.984
I thought
you were excited

20:52.018 --> 20:53.453
to spend the day
with Hennessy at school.

20:53.486 --> 20:55.722
I was.

20:55.755 --> 20:57.857
Who can tell me what
the Pythagorean theorem is?

20:59.926 --> 21:01.928
The square of the hypotenuse
is equal

21:01.961 --> 21:04.797
to the sum of the squares
of the other two sides.

21:04.831 --> 21:07.800
[ Smack! ]
[ Gasps ]

21:07.834 --> 21:09.836
But that was
the right answer.

21:09.869 --> 21:12.439
I know, but I didn't
say it loud enough.

21:12.472 --> 21:16.443
I am an American citizen.
Please take me to my embassy.

21:16.476 --> 21:19.278
I'll go get us a cab.

21:25.685 --> 21:27.520
Jessica: Ahh!
Ahh!

21:27.554 --> 21:29.322
It's so nice and cool
in here.

21:29.356 --> 21:31.458
Feels good to be home,
doesn't it?

21:31.491 --> 21:33.860
Wait. Who the hell
left the A.C. on?!

21:35.161 --> 21:37.530
Come back, outer beauty!

21:37.564 --> 21:39.832
Alison: Hey.

21:39.866 --> 21:41.634
Eddie.

21:41.668 --> 21:42.835
It's over.

21:42.869 --> 21:44.270
Alison, I swear.

21:44.303 --> 21:45.972
I tried to fax you
every day,

21:46.005 --> 21:47.940
but I couldn't find
a fax machine and so --

21:47.974 --> 21:49.342
Oh, it's fine.

21:49.376 --> 21:50.710
I figured something
like that happened.

21:50.743 --> 21:51.878
No big deal.

21:51.911 --> 21:53.179
Really?

21:53.212 --> 21:54.681
Then what did you mean
by "It's over"?

21:54.714 --> 21:56.549
