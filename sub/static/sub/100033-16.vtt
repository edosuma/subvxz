00:15.798 --> 00:18.409
- I can't believe
they're still sleeping.

00:19.410 --> 00:21.499
- I know.

00:21.543 --> 00:25.329
I think they actually
sleep better with company.

00:26.504 --> 00:28.463
- Me too.

01:24.127 --> 01:26.477
- Really?

01:28.827 --> 01:30.873

- Oh, you must want

02:06.778 --> 02:09.172
- I knew Castro
was up to something,

02:09.216 --> 02:11.522
but making her patients tumors
look worse

02:11.566 --> 02:13.394
than they actually are
so that when they get better

02:13.437 --> 02:14.917
it makes her trial
look more effective?

02:14.960 --> 02:16.397
- So her trial's a sham.

02:16.440 --> 02:17.615
- I don't know the extent
of it.

02:17.659 --> 02:19.487
I only know that
she's falsifying her data.

02:19.530 --> 02:22.185
- You have to take this to Max.
- I can't.

02:22.229 --> 02:25.710
Max made it policy to go public
with our mistakes.

02:25.754 --> 02:27.321
To own them.

02:27.364 --> 02:30.237
If this gets out, New Amsterdam
will lose our NIH funding,

02:30.280 --> 02:31.455
and that is millions
of dollars.

02:31.499 --> 02:32.848
- What about Brantley?

02:32.891 --> 02:34.284
- She'd just sweep it
under the rug

02:34.328 --> 02:35.372
to avoid a PR nightmare.

02:35.416 --> 02:37.896
- Well, then what are you
gonna do?

02:37.940 --> 02:40.551
- Blow up her trial.

02:41.857 --> 02:43.902
- I'd read about
pituitary veinous sampling.

02:43.946 --> 02:45.687
I've never
actually seen it done.

02:45.730 --> 02:47.645
- Many less experienced
neurologists

02:47.689 --> 02:51.345
fear this procedure because it
requires a precise localization

02:51.388 --> 02:54.522
and sturdy hands,
which in my case is not...

02:57.916 --> 02:59.788
Give me a moment, please.

03:01.703 --> 03:05.576
Ella, I don't think
you should touch that.

03:05.620 --> 03:08.362
- Oh, that is a she,
and her name is Calliope.

03:08.405 --> 03:09.798
We'll call her Callie
for short.

03:09.841 --> 03:11.669
I didn't think I'd ever
be ready for another pet

03:11.713 --> 03:12.844
after Gertie died.

03:12.888 --> 03:13.932
- Pet?

03:13.976 --> 03:16.892
To live with us?
- Yeah.

03:16.935 --> 03:19.199
Well, Dr. Frome thought
it might be a good idea

03:19.242 --> 03:22.289
if I had an emotional support
animal to help manage my OCD.

03:22.332 --> 03:24.334
And she's pretty much
the cutest, isn't she?

03:24.378 --> 03:26.858
- Yes, she's cute.
Very cute.

03:29.383 --> 03:30.558
I should be going.

03:30.601 --> 03:32.473
- Oh, okay.
Well, we'll see you at home.

03:34.431 --> 03:36.259
- Hmm.

03:37.304 --> 03:39.262
Cancel the veinous sampling.
- Wait--what?

03:39.306 --> 03:40.524
- Will you do that, Agnes,
please?

03:40.568 --> 03:41.656
- I can't.

03:41.699 --> 03:43.310
Mr. Bagey's is already
being prepped!

03:48.489 --> 03:50.578
- Okay, you are more
than welcome

03:50.621 --> 03:52.406
to sit down if you want.

03:54.843 --> 03:56.410
Anywhere you like.

04:00.414 --> 04:01.763
So, you are aware

04:01.806 --> 04:04.287
of why your parents sent you
here to see me, right?

04:04.331 --> 04:06.637
Uh, it's for refusing
to go to school.

04:06.681 --> 04:09.727
And, uh, your parents say you
came back about two weeks ago

04:09.771 --> 04:11.338
a different kid.

04:11.381 --> 04:13.731
Won't come out of your room,
easily upset.

04:13.775 --> 04:15.559
- I can't be in my room?

04:15.603 --> 04:18.301
- Well, not if it means
skipping school, no.

04:23.524 --> 04:26.048
Danica, why do you keep looking
at the door?

04:31.445 --> 04:34.361
Do you--do you feel unsafe
right now?

04:36.450 --> 04:39.844
Do you feel that way a lot?

04:39.888 --> 04:41.846
Did something happen at school?

04:46.938 --> 04:49.289
Danica, why are you afraid
to go to school?

04:52.683 --> 04:54.076
- Because I can't stop
seeing Megan

04:54.119 --> 04:56.557
lying on the floor
with a hole in her head.

04:56.600 --> 04:58.950
That's why.

05:02.040 --> 05:04.434
- I think you guys
seriously buried the lede.

05:04.478 --> 05:05.609
How could you not tell me

05:05.653 --> 05:07.045
Danica was in
a school shooting?

05:07.089 --> 05:09.744
- What--what school shooting?
- I think we'd know

05:09.787 --> 05:11.398
if there was a shooting
at our daughter's school.

05:11.441 --> 05:13.095
- There wasn't.

05:19.406 --> 05:23.018
- How was dinner with mom?
- Oh, it was great.

05:23.061 --> 05:24.846
After 20 years,
I finally told her

05:24.889 --> 05:26.021
what a nightmare it was

05:26.064 --> 05:28.458
being raised
by such a raging alcoholic.

05:28.502 --> 05:31.331
But instead of apologizing
and accepting responsibility,

05:31.374 --> 05:33.376
she said she didn't
remember it.

05:33.420 --> 05:35.813
- Wow.
She tried to gaslight you?

05:35.857 --> 05:37.424
That's messed up.

05:37.467 --> 05:40.818
- Guess I'll add that to her
list of irredeemable qualities.

05:40.862 --> 05:42.994
- Dr. Lauren Bloom?
- Yes?

05:43.952 --> 05:46.520
- You've been served.

05:46.563 --> 05:48.826
- Why did you tell your mother
that our wedding

05:48.870 --> 05:50.132
might not be in San Francisco

05:50.175 --> 05:51.873
when you know
it definitely will be?

05:51.916 --> 05:53.744
- It's called
"stepping out the truth."

05:53.788 --> 05:55.877
- Mmm, it's called "lying."
- I just heard.

05:55.920 --> 06:00.011
And my one question is: how big
a going away party do you want?

06:00.055 --> 06:01.622
- Oh, no, no, no, no.

06:01.665 --> 06:03.014
No thank you.

06:03.058 --> 06:04.755
Um, I'm trying to keep this
all low key.

06:04.799 --> 06:06.583
- Not gonna happen.
- Of course.

06:06.627 --> 06:08.150
- You were saying?

06:08.193 --> 06:10.935
- Well, look, my sisters and I
learned early that with Mama,

06:10.979 --> 06:12.807
you gotta roll
the truth out gradually

06:12.850 --> 06:14.939
so she has time to acclimate.
- Mmm.

06:14.983 --> 06:16.071
- Dr. Reynolds?

06:16.114 --> 06:17.942
- Oh, no going away cards,
please.

06:17.986 --> 06:19.509
- You've been served.

06:21.903 --> 06:24.035
- You have an administrative
meeting at 2:00.

06:24.079 --> 06:26.951
- Great.
- And dermatology wants to know

06:26.995 --> 06:29.911
if you could touch base
about new exam lights.

06:29.954 --> 06:32.043
- Sounds like a plan.

06:32.087 --> 06:34.394
- Have you been replaced
by a pod person?

06:34.437 --> 06:35.743
- I don't think so.

06:35.786 --> 06:38.136
- You hate meetings,
and these are the worst.

06:38.180 --> 06:40.182
- Well, I'm just in
a very good mood,

06:40.225 --> 06:43.403
and nothing gonna change that.

06:43.446 --> 06:46.884
- Hospital's being sued.
- Okay, that didn't last long.

06:46.928 --> 06:49.539
- High profile case--we're
talking community backlash,

06:49.583 --> 06:52.063
media circus, and a ridiculous
amount of money on the table.

06:52.107 --> 06:54.414
HCC and the mayor's office
have already called

06:54.457 --> 06:55.676
to make sure
we don't screw it up.

06:55.719 --> 06:57.199
- Who is it?
- George Whitney's family's

06:57.242 --> 07:00.028
accusing us of malpractice
and wrongful death.

07:00.071 --> 07:01.899
Every doctor involved
in his care

07:01.943 --> 07:03.640
is being sued,
including--

07:03.684 --> 07:04.989
- Dr. Max Goodwin?
- Yes?

07:05.033 --> 07:06.469
- You've been served.

07:16.131 --> 07:18.350
Okay, why are you stressed?
You're out of here, aren't you?

07:18.394 --> 07:20.004
- Really?

07:20.048 --> 07:22.354
A patient died,
and we're being blamed for it.

07:22.398 --> 07:24.487
- We didn't do anything wrong.

07:24.531 --> 07:26.228
So all we can do now
is tell the truth,

07:26.271 --> 07:27.359
and we're gonna be fine.

07:27.403 --> 07:29.231
- Deposition prep
isn't about the truth.

07:29.274 --> 07:31.407
It's about finding weak spots
in our stories.

07:31.451 --> 07:32.495
So we see how strong

07:32.539 --> 07:35.019
the opposition's case is
against us.

07:35.063 --> 07:37.935
- Thank you, Dr. Optimism.
- He's right.

07:40.503 --> 07:42.592
Hospitals go down
because of cases like this.

07:47.249 --> 07:49.033
- Lauren?
I'm ready for you.

08:00.131 --> 08:02.046
- To gain access to the tumor,

08:02.090 --> 08:05.876
we first locate
the internal jugular vein.

08:05.920 --> 08:08.444
- BP normative,
respiration spontaneous.

08:10.141 --> 08:12.143
- I'm not getting flash-back.

08:13.231 --> 08:14.537
- Abscess in the airway.

08:14.581 --> 08:17.192
- The needle broke.

08:17.235 --> 08:20.108
- How did it break?
Needles don't just break.

08:20.151 --> 08:21.936
- Well, this one just did.

08:21.979 --> 08:23.503
- There's ectopy
on the monitor.

08:23.546 --> 08:25.505
- The needle may be lodged
in his right ventricle.

08:25.548 --> 08:27.550
If we don't get it out,
he will get a heart attack.

08:27.594 --> 08:29.987
Page cardiothoracic.

08:30.031 --> 08:32.250
You get him to an O.R.
- Where are you going?

08:32.294 --> 08:34.557
Dr. Kapoor, what's happening?

08:34.601 --> 08:36.385
- This is all happening
because of that cat.

08:36.428 --> 08:38.953
- What?

08:39.997 --> 08:41.999
- Nurse supervisor
to main floor.

08:42.043 --> 08:44.915
Nurse supervisor
to main floor.

08:44.959 --> 08:46.308
- B.

08:48.266 --> 08:50.573
Ready to go.

08:50.617 --> 08:52.575
I'll check back
in a couple minutes.

08:57.145 --> 08:59.626
- May.
Morning.

08:59.669 --> 09:01.932
Uh, would you be able to get

09:01.976 --> 09:03.543
a couple of extra blankets for
the chairs in there, please?

09:03.586 --> 09:05.980
It's freezing.
- Sure.

09:06.023 --> 09:08.635
- Thank you.

09:36.750 --> 09:39.535
- Here you go, Dr. Sharpe.
- Thank you so much.

09:39.579 --> 09:41.581
Uh, everyone
will appreciate this.

09:44.192 --> 09:46.629
- We were in Mr. Marks'
history class

09:46.673 --> 09:49.327
when there was this bang.

09:49.371 --> 09:52.635
Mr. Marks started screaming.
Telling us to get down.

09:56.683 --> 09:58.336
I looked out into the hall

09:58.380 --> 10:02.166
and there was this man there
with a gun.

10:03.690 --> 10:06.562
He was shooting into the class
across from us

10:06.606 --> 10:08.738
over and over again.

10:11.567 --> 10:14.222
Then I saw Megan coming back
from the bathroom.

10:15.266 --> 10:18.487
And my brain was like,
"Go help her!"

10:20.141 --> 10:22.056
But I couldn't move.

10:24.580 --> 10:26.582
And then he shot her.

10:29.411 --> 10:31.761
Mr. Marks was shoving a table
against the door.

10:31.805 --> 10:34.416
Everyone was crying.

10:37.158 --> 10:41.075
And I was just standing there,
staring at Megan on the ground.

10:48.778 --> 10:52.086
Then the bell rang,

10:52.129 --> 10:54.828
and the man stopped shooting,

10:54.871 --> 10:56.612
and Megan got up.

10:58.745 --> 11:01.051
And they told us
it was just a drill.

11:01.095 --> 11:03.271
A stupid drill.

11:04.751 --> 11:06.622
- Megan was part of it?

11:08.363 --> 11:11.322
- So was the man firing blanks.

11:11.366 --> 11:14.543
But it all felt real.

11:15.631 --> 11:17.589
- Her school didn't tell us
that there would be

11:17.633 --> 11:20.636
anything like this.

11:22.464 --> 11:25.467
- No one knew.
Not even the teachers.

11:27.208 --> 11:30.602
I know it wasn't real.
I...

11:33.693 --> 11:37.174
But I feel scared all the time.

11:37.218 --> 11:40.177
I can't go back there.

11:47.010 --> 11:48.490
- Four weeks ago, a patient
named George Whitney

11:48.533 --> 11:51.580
entered the ED.
Do you remember this patient?

11:51.623 --> 11:54.104
- Of course I remember him.
He was, uh--

11:54.148 --> 11:56.106
- Lauren, don't give more
information than was asked.

11:56.150 --> 11:57.717
- Right.

11:57.760 --> 11:59.414
Okay.

11:59.457 --> 12:01.329
- Do you remember
George Whitney?

12:01.372 --> 12:02.634
- Yes.

12:02.678 --> 12:04.419
- Can you describe
Mr. Whitney's condition

12:04.462 --> 12:05.463
when he entered your care?

12:07.901 --> 12:10.338
- George Whitney,
30-year-old man,

12:10.381 --> 12:12.035
collapsed at a street fair

12:12.079 --> 12:13.820
with blurred vision, shortness
of breath, and hemiparesis.

12:13.863 --> 12:15.909
Tachy, hypotensive, and
tachypneic in the field.

12:15.952 --> 12:17.693
- Any allergies, Mr. Whitney?

12:17.737 --> 12:19.434
You taking any medications?
- No.

12:19.477 --> 12:20.783
- Okay, let's get him
to trauma one,

12:20.827 --> 12:22.480
and hook him up to a monitor
on O-2.

12:22.524 --> 12:23.743
What do we got here?

12:23.786 --> 12:24.918
- How many patients were
admitted that day

12:24.961 --> 12:26.441
to the best of
your recollection?

12:26.484 --> 12:27.529
- Eight patients,

12:27.572 --> 12:29.313
all presenting
with the same symptoms.

12:29.357 --> 12:31.663
- And what did the police say
happened to these people?

12:31.707 --> 12:32.839
- Some sort of smoke device
went off

12:32.882 --> 12:34.101
at a Middle Eastern
Street Fair.

12:34.144 --> 12:35.755
- They were exposed
to more than just smoke.

12:35.798 --> 12:37.669
- People complain of
a weird smell at the scene.

12:37.713 --> 12:40.542
- Double vision, descending
paralysis, diaphoresis.

12:40.585 --> 12:42.892
Botulism toxin.
- This was a terror attack?

12:42.936 --> 12:44.807
- Casey, dilute one vile
of anti-toxin

12:44.851 --> 12:47.462
in 100 cc's normal saline
and infuse as slow IV drip

12:47.505 --> 12:48.898
with close
hemodynamic monitoring.

12:48.942 --> 12:50.204
- Copy that.

12:50.247 --> 12:52.641
- But that's not what
the patient received.

12:52.684 --> 12:53.903
- Well, that's what I told
Casey to give them.

12:53.947 --> 12:56.340
- Casey wasn't working
that day.

12:56.384 --> 12:57.646
- Of course he was.

12:59.474 --> 13:01.824
- Nurse's schedule.
Casey's not on it.

13:04.218 --> 13:05.567
- But I thought...

13:08.570 --> 13:10.006
I don't...

13:10.050 --> 13:12.966
- Would you care to revise
your statement, Dr. Bloom?

13:16.534 --> 13:18.536
- All right, you're up.

13:18.580 --> 13:20.800
- All right, let's see
what we got.

13:20.843 --> 13:23.367
- Hey, doc.

13:42.778 --> 13:46.608
- Tell me I'm crazy.
Did you sabotage my trial?

13:47.478 --> 13:50.481
- You didn't give me a choice.

13:56.879 --> 13:58.489
- What the hell
were you thinking?

13:58.533 --> 13:59.751
Switching my patient's meds?

13:59.795 --> 14:01.101
- Everyone got their chemo.
Everyone's safe.

14:01.144 --> 14:03.190
That's all that matters.
- Oh, that's all that matters?

14:03.233 --> 14:05.061
There's no control group
anymore.

14:05.105 --> 14:07.194
Everyone's been dosed
with the trial additive.

14:07.237 --> 14:10.284
- I guess you'll just have to
start your trial over again.

14:11.763 --> 14:14.897
Are you really that jealous
that you have to kill it?

14:14.941 --> 14:18.379
- I know what you did
with your patients' baselines.

14:23.340 --> 14:25.473
- I only did that because
the preliminary data

14:25.516 --> 14:28.780
showed the drug was not working
well enough on this protocol.

14:28.824 --> 14:29.999
- Then you report that.

14:30.043 --> 14:31.261
If the drug doesn't work,
it doesn't work.

14:31.305 --> 14:33.394
- It will work,
when I have more time

14:33.437 --> 14:34.743
to get the parameters
of the trial right,

14:34.786 --> 14:36.397
and I will once it gets
to phase three.

14:36.440 --> 14:37.746
- You have to shut
this down now.

14:37.789 --> 14:39.356
The entire trial
has been compromised.

14:39.400 --> 14:41.402
- The trial, yes,
but not the drug.

14:41.445 --> 14:44.100
I am bringing it
to phase three.

14:44.144 --> 14:47.147
- Then I am taking this to Max.

14:50.019 --> 14:51.238
- If you were willing
to do that,

14:51.281 --> 14:52.935
you would have done so already.

14:59.289 --> 15:01.291
That's what I thought.

15:06.601 --> 15:09.909
- These are the best active
shooter drills available.

15:09.952 --> 15:12.085
These drills could save
our students' lives.

15:12.128 --> 15:13.260
- Okay, if I showed you an MRI

15:13.303 --> 15:14.783
from a kid
that was in your drill,

15:14.826 --> 15:16.263
or an MRI from a kid
that was in an actual shooting,

15:16.306 --> 15:17.655
do you know what you'd see?

15:17.699 --> 15:19.962
- They would be similar?
- They would be identical.

15:20.006 --> 15:21.833
Right down to
the long-term problems,

15:21.877 --> 15:24.184
from the fear, the depression,
the anger, the anxiety.

15:24.227 --> 15:26.012
The full PTSD buffet.

15:26.055 --> 15:27.796
Trauma doesn't happen
because you're in danger,

15:27.839 --> 15:30.886
it's because you think you are.
- So what would you have me do?

15:30.930 --> 15:32.975
Pretend school shootings
don't exist?

15:33.019 --> 15:33.976
- No.

15:34.020 --> 15:35.195
- Ignore the law?
- No.

15:35.238 --> 15:36.370
- God forbid a real shooting
happens here.

15:36.413 --> 15:39.242
I'll be damned if my kids
aren't prepared.

15:39.286 --> 15:41.288
- Okay, look,
I recognize that you are in

15:41.331 --> 15:44.465
an impossible situation here,
but there are alternatives.

15:44.508 --> 15:46.075
There are desktop
training programs.

15:46.119 --> 15:48.512
One where the kids don't have
to act out traumatizing events.

15:48.556 --> 15:50.340
Because all that does
is make them believe

15:50.384 --> 15:52.168
that they've already
been through one, like Danica.

15:52.212 --> 15:53.604
- Well, I'm sorry about Danica,

15:53.648 --> 15:56.956
but I haven't heard
any other complaints.

15:56.999 --> 15:58.261
- Well, how many students
have checked in

15:58.305 --> 16:00.133
with the school's counselors?

16:00.176 --> 16:03.005
- With all the budget cuts,
we don't have any.

16:04.528 --> 16:07.009
- Well, you do now.

16:08.271 --> 16:10.317
- I'm not seeing patients
today.

16:10.360 --> 16:12.319
- Um, I just--

16:12.362 --> 16:16.497
okay, how much can substance
abuse affect someone's memory?

16:16.540 --> 16:20.501
- Depends on substance and the
degree to which it was abused.

16:20.544 --> 16:24.896
Genetics can also be a factor.
Why are you asking?

16:25.680 --> 16:30.946
- Um, I abused Adderall
for a while.

16:30.990 --> 16:32.513
Now I'm forgetting things.

16:32.556 --> 16:34.167
- What kind of things?

16:35.168 --> 16:36.473
- Details about a day

16:36.517 --> 16:38.649
that I should've remembered
everything about.

16:38.693 --> 16:40.347
And my alcoholic mother says

16:40.390 --> 16:43.045
she can't remember
the last 15 years, so,

16:43.089 --> 16:45.569
I don't know, given my stellar
gene pool and my own issues,

16:45.613 --> 16:46.744
maybe I'm just--

16:46.788 --> 16:48.529
- Lauren, there's
a significant difference

16:48.572 --> 16:50.226
between the type of memory loss

16:50.270 --> 16:53.186
associated with a lifetime
of substance abuse

16:53.229 --> 16:55.144
and your situation.

16:56.450 --> 16:59.192
- Are you sure?

16:59.235 --> 17:02.630
- I see you every day.
I work with you every day.

17:02.673 --> 17:04.936
There is nothing
that concerns me.

17:06.112 --> 17:08.027
- Okay.

17:08.070 --> 17:10.333
- Your mother's condition,
on the other hand,

17:10.377 --> 17:12.944
is much more serious.

17:14.294 --> 17:17.645
And very real.
She may never remember.

17:23.433 --> 17:26.567
- Dr. Goodwin, isn't it unusual
for you to dedicate

17:26.610 --> 17:29.570
your entire day to the ED
given the scope of your duties?

17:29.613 --> 17:33.139
- Uh, yes, but because this
was such a high profile case,

17:33.182 --> 17:36.446
the mayor asked me to monitor
the victims personally.

17:36.490 --> 17:39.188
- So you were there in your
capacity as medical director?

17:39.232 --> 17:41.147
- That's right.

17:41.190 --> 17:43.279
- Double vision, descending
paralysis, diaphoresis.

17:43.323 --> 17:45.238
Botulism toxin.

17:45.281 --> 17:47.631
- This was a terror attack?
- Brunstetter.

17:47.675 --> 17:51.244
Dilute one vial of anti-toxin
in 100 cc's normal saline

17:51.287 --> 17:52.375
and infuse as a slow IV drip

17:52.419 --> 17:53.420
with close
hemodynamic monitoring.

17:53.463 --> 17:55.117
- Copy that.

17:55.161 --> 17:57.598
- Technician to X-ray one.
Lab technician to X-ray one.

17:57.641 --> 17:59.121
- Forget the dilution.

17:59.165 --> 18:01.036
Push anti-toxin in a
a single IV injection.

18:01.080 --> 18:02.342
- I have to clear that
with Dr. Bloom.

18:02.385 --> 18:04.170
- No, there isn't enough time,
okay?

18:04.213 --> 18:05.736
Patients could die
unless you push the full dose

18:05.780 --> 18:08.348
of anti-toxin now.

18:08.391 --> 18:10.698
- So you countermanded
Dr. Bloom's order?

18:10.741 --> 18:12.656
- Yes.

18:12.700 --> 18:14.397
- Then she wasn't at fault
for giving an order

18:14.441 --> 18:15.877
that was never carried out?

18:15.920 --> 18:17.531
- I don't know if we should be
assigning blame, I think--

18:17.574 --> 18:18.662
- Did all eight patients

18:18.706 --> 18:20.229
respond to your treatment,
Dr. Goodwin?

18:23.319 --> 18:24.581
- All but one.

18:26.322 --> 18:28.455
- Kay, I got it.
It's weak, but it's there.

18:28.498 --> 18:30.283
- What do you got?
- V-fib arrest.

18:30.326 --> 18:31.588
A tachy hypotensive.

18:31.632 --> 18:33.068
We're in the middle of an echo
when he arrested.

18:33.112 --> 18:34.591
- Global left ventricular
hypokinesis.

18:34.635 --> 18:36.419
We gotta to get him
to the O.R. now.

18:36.463 --> 18:37.986
- Would you say the decision

18:38.029 --> 18:39.770
to treat with a full dose of
anti-toxin was made in haste?

18:39.814 --> 18:42.164
- During an emergency,

18:42.208 --> 18:44.993
doctors have to make
a lot of decisions in haste.

18:45.036 --> 18:46.603
- But you weren't there
as a doctor.

18:46.647 --> 18:49.171
To your own admission, you were
there as medical director.

18:49.215 --> 18:51.304
- I have to wear multiple hats
every day.

18:51.347 --> 18:52.522
- Which hat were you wearing

18:52.566 --> 18:54.045
when you countermanded
Dr. Bloom's order

18:54.089 --> 18:55.351
to follow
the dilution protocol?

18:55.395 --> 18:57.092
- My doctor hat.

18:57.136 --> 18:58.485
- But obviously,
Nurse Brunstetter saw you

18:58.528 --> 19:00.661
as the medical director.
- While that may be true,

19:00.704 --> 19:02.271
I don't know what affected
their decision--

19:02.315 --> 19:03.664
- Which may have meant
Nurse Brunstetter

19:03.707 --> 19:05.492
may have felt unable
to contradict your directive--

19:05.535 --> 19:06.797
- I have no idea

19:06.841 --> 19:08.669
what Nurse Brunstetter
may or may not have felt--

19:08.712 --> 19:10.192
- A directive that may have led

19:10.236 --> 19:12.499
to George Whitney's
cardiac arrest.

19:12.542 --> 19:14.196
From where I sit,

19:14.240 --> 19:16.503
because you wear multiple hats,

19:16.546 --> 19:18.331
one of your patients died.

19:24.293 --> 19:26.904
- Okay, um, hi, everybody.
My name is Dr. Iggy Frome.

19:26.948 --> 19:28.297
You can just call me Iggy.

19:28.341 --> 19:30.081
Um, first of all, I'd like
to thank Principal Colvin

19:30.125 --> 19:32.214
for allowing me
to speak to you all today.

19:32.258 --> 19:34.477
Bet you're all pretty pumped
to be missing some class, huh?

19:34.521 --> 19:36.523
Yhoo!

19:36.566 --> 19:38.786
- They're missing gym.

19:38.829 --> 19:41.005
- Yikes.
Uh, okay.

19:41.049 --> 19:45.009
So I promise you that I'm here
for a good reason, guys.

19:45.053 --> 19:47.186
I'm here to talk to you
about the shooting drill

19:47.229 --> 19:48.752
that happened
a couple weeks ago.

19:48.796 --> 19:50.667
I want to talk to you about how
that made you feel.

19:52.974 --> 19:54.671
- Yeah, okay, all right.
Yeah, fair enough.

19:54.715 --> 19:56.195
I hear you loud and clear.

19:56.238 --> 19:58.501
Talking about our feelings
is not your favorite subject.

19:58.545 --> 19:59.807
I don't blame you.

19:59.850 --> 20:01.765
Why don't we try something
a little different.

20:01.809 --> 20:03.767
Try something easier.
You guys like easy?

20:03.811 --> 20:05.682
kids: Yeah.
- Yeah, good, me too.

20:05.726 --> 20:07.293
Um, I'm gonna say something,

20:07.336 --> 20:09.860
and if you agree,
clap your hands twice.

20:09.904 --> 20:11.558
That's it.
Can you handle it?

20:11.601 --> 20:12.950
kids: Yes.
- Of course you can.

20:12.994 --> 20:16.040
All right, this assembly
seems crazy boring.

20:17.564 --> 20:20.567
- Whoa.
Wow, all of you.

20:20.610 --> 20:21.872
Okay, step two.

20:21.916 --> 20:23.874
I'm gonna say something,
and again, if you agree,

20:23.918 --> 20:26.703
uh, this time just come walk
down onto the court with me.

20:26.747 --> 20:27.878
Okay?
Ready?

20:27.922 --> 20:30.229
I sometimes feel scared
about guns.

20:38.715 --> 20:40.891
- I do.
I'm scared about guns.

20:42.850 --> 20:44.721
Really?
I'm the only one?

20:44.765 --> 20:47.115
I find that a little hard
to believe, but okay.

20:47.158 --> 20:48.856
I have had a dream

20:48.899 --> 20:50.945
about the shooting drill
since it happened.

20:52.816 --> 20:54.601
It doesn't need to be
a nightmare necessarily.

20:54.644 --> 20:56.907
Just a dream.
Any kind of dream.

20:58.126 --> 20:59.910
Yeah.

21:01.347 --> 21:02.739
Good, thank you.
Come on down here.

21:02.783 --> 21:04.263
Yeah, come on down.
Take a spot.

21:04.306 --> 21:06.917
Anywhere on the floor with me,
okay, guys?

21:06.961 --> 21:08.049
Thank you.
Okay!

21:08.092 --> 21:09.833
Here's another.

21:09.877 --> 21:11.313
I avoid going to where I was

21:11.357 --> 21:13.054
where the shooting drill
happened.

21:15.317 --> 21:17.276
Yeah, I would too.

21:20.104 --> 21:22.759
I sometimes have a hard time
concentrating in class

21:22.803 --> 21:25.806
because I'm thinking about
someone charging in with a gun.

21:31.115 --> 21:33.988
Yeah, that would make it hard
to concentrate, wouldn't it?

21:34.031 --> 21:35.946
All right, one last one.

21:35.990 --> 21:38.862
When I have felt scared
since the drill,

21:38.906 --> 21:40.864
I thought that
I was the only one.

21:45.826 --> 21:48.307
Find somewhere around me.
Make sure you can all hear me.

21:48.350 --> 21:50.134
Make room for everybody.
Okay.

21:50.178 --> 21:52.963
We're all here.
Take a look around.

21:53.007 --> 21:54.313
Look at your classmates.

21:56.184 --> 21:59.274
Your feelings are not weird
or wrong

21:59.318 --> 22:02.886
because we've all got them.
You've all got them, okay?

22:02.930 --> 22:04.061
But those feelings,
they're not--

22:04.105 --> 22:05.411
they're not gonna
just go away.

22:05.454 --> 22:06.716
They are going to find
somewhere inside of you

22:06.760 --> 22:08.022
and make a home, all right?

22:08.065 --> 22:10.894
The only way to avoid that
is by talking.

22:10.938 --> 22:12.635
We have to talk to each other.

22:12.679 --> 22:14.202
You have to talk
to your parents.

22:14.245 --> 22:17.248
Talk to your counselors.

22:21.818 --> 22:23.864
So let's start talking.

22:29.304 --> 22:33.003
- You look how I feel.

22:33.047 --> 22:35.092
You first.

22:38.226 --> 22:41.664
So, I'm gonna
tell you something,

22:41.708 --> 22:45.973
and I need you to not react
like "Max the Revolutionary."

22:46.016 --> 22:49.846
- Which Max do you need?
- The sane medical director.

22:49.890 --> 22:52.196
- Really want me
to pick a lane today.

22:52.240 --> 22:54.242
- Did something happen
at deposition prep?

22:55.374 --> 22:56.766
- I don't know.
I...

22:58.768 --> 23:02.076
Starting to wonder if maybe
I'm doing this wrong.

23:02.119 --> 23:03.860
- Doing what wrong?

23:07.298 --> 23:12.260
- I wear these scrubs
so I can actually help

23:12.303 --> 23:15.219
people, but what if
I'm not helping?

23:16.830 --> 23:19.049
What if I'm just
making things...

23:20.834 --> 23:22.792
Worse.

23:22.836 --> 23:25.012
I mean, maybe I should
just wear a suit.

23:25.055 --> 23:26.535
You know?

23:26.579 --> 23:30.321
And actually sit at my desk
like a sane medical director.

23:34.021 --> 23:35.283
Maybe it's time

23:35.326 --> 23:37.285
I stopped trying to be
all things to all people.

23:39.461 --> 23:43.465
- The Max who is all things
to all people

23:43.509 --> 23:46.294
is the Max that we all need.

23:48.252 --> 23:49.428
I need.

23:53.475 --> 23:55.216
How can I help?

23:57.958 --> 24:00.264
- Actually,

24:00.308 --> 24:02.963
I don't need you to.

24:03.006 --> 24:05.052
I have to handle this one.

24:07.315 --> 24:09.883
- Dr. Flores was able
to remove the needle

24:09.926 --> 24:11.928
from Mr. Bagey's heart
with no damage.

24:11.972 --> 24:13.887
He should make a full recovery.
- Good.

24:13.930 --> 24:15.889
Then I'm staying right here
for the rest of the day

24:15.932 --> 24:17.934
to avoid doing more harm.

24:17.978 --> 24:20.023
- Is there something going on
with you today?

24:20.067 --> 24:22.896
- There is nothing wrong
with me.

24:22.939 --> 24:24.288
- Good.

24:24.332 --> 24:27.248
- The problem is the cat.

24:27.291 --> 24:29.946
- Why do you keep bringing up
this cat?

24:29.990 --> 24:31.818
- Ella's cat.

24:31.861 --> 24:33.559
The harbinger of bad luck.

24:33.602 --> 24:35.125
From the time it has showed up,

24:35.169 --> 24:37.519
my entire day
has been disastrous.

24:37.563 --> 24:40.087
And now it's going
to live with me

24:40.130 --> 24:44.221
to destroy my life.
No, no, no, no, no.

24:44.265 --> 24:46.310
I have to get rid of this cat.

24:53.361 --> 24:55.058
- Hey, did you reorder
any of those--

24:55.102 --> 24:56.973
- Kapoor says
it's probably true.

24:57.017 --> 24:58.584
- Did I miss part of
this conversation?

24:58.627 --> 25:02.022
- He said those 15 years
are probably gone.

25:03.153 --> 25:05.504
From my mom.

25:05.547 --> 25:07.810
- Completely?
- Could be.

25:09.986 --> 25:11.858
It just pisses me off,
you know?

25:11.901 --> 25:13.207
I mean, if I have to remember

25:13.250 --> 25:15.339
every brutal detail
about my childhood

25:15.383 --> 25:17.559
then she should have to
remember it too.

25:17.603 --> 25:20.519
- Look.

25:20.562 --> 25:22.346
I know you're hurt,

25:22.390 --> 25:24.348
I know you've been carrying
around these feelings

25:24.392 --> 25:25.611
for a lot of years,

25:25.654 --> 25:30.006
but maybe it's time
to stop looking backward.

25:30.050 --> 25:33.532
You know,
start looking forward.

25:48.677 --> 25:51.201
- I don't see Max with you.
- You were right.

25:51.245 --> 25:54.161
I do need Max.
- Hmm.

25:54.204 --> 25:57.425
- This entire hospital
needs Max.

25:57.468 --> 26:01.908
And six months ago he was
dying, and I couldn't save him.

26:03.518 --> 26:04.954
But you did.

26:07.609 --> 26:09.568
You knew precision oncology
was the future

26:09.611 --> 26:12.048
long before anyone else.

26:12.092 --> 26:15.922
But if I could figure out
that you falsified your data,

26:15.965 --> 26:18.577
then NIH will too,
and that kind of scandal--

26:18.620 --> 26:21.405
- You expect me to believe
you're worried about me?

26:21.449 --> 26:23.059
- Not you.

26:23.103 --> 26:25.192
Your work.

26:25.235 --> 26:27.586
It's the only reason
that Max is alive.

26:29.588 --> 26:32.547
- Then, what are you gonna do?

26:37.073 --> 26:39.989
- I'm gonna help you
get away with it.

26:57.703 --> 26:59.661
- Dr. Floyd Reynolds,

26:59.705 --> 27:02.011
can you describe for me
in detail

27:02.055 --> 27:03.404
what happened in your O.R.

27:03.447 --> 27:05.928
during George Whitney's
LVAD operation?

27:21.117 --> 27:23.685
- Bypass is ready when you are.
- Ah, rib spreader.

27:23.729 --> 27:26.427
- Why were you placing the left
ventricular assist device?

27:26.470 --> 27:28.472
- Mr. Whitney suffered
from Acute Coronary Syndrome

27:28.516 --> 27:31.345
from a blockage in his left
main coronary artery.

27:31.388 --> 27:32.738
- Did this have anything to do

27:32.781 --> 27:34.957
with Dr. Goodwin's
administration of anti-toxin?

27:35.001 --> 27:37.438
- No, no.
Max had nothing to do with it.

27:37.481 --> 27:39.005
It was
a pre-existing condition,

27:39.048 --> 27:41.964
most likely exacerbated
by the events of the day.

27:42.008 --> 27:43.966
- Once you decided an LVAD
was necessary,

27:44.010 --> 27:46.665
you made a second choice.

27:46.708 --> 27:49.319
To install it via
a full median sternotomy

27:49.363 --> 27:52.496
rather than the less invasive
catheter introduced LVAD.

27:52.540 --> 27:54.542
Why?

27:54.585 --> 27:56.500
- Well, he was unstable

27:56.544 --> 27:59.025
and needed immediate help
stabilizing his blood pressure.

27:59.068 --> 28:01.636
And a sternotomy
was the fastest way.

28:01.680 --> 28:05.509
- So why weren't you able
to stabilize Mr. Whitney?

28:05.553 --> 28:08.121
- TF on one.
- He's stoking out.

28:08.164 --> 28:10.514
- The embolism in the MCA
is not responding to TPA.

28:10.558 --> 28:12.603
- Then we need to go
with plan B: embolectomy.

28:12.647 --> 28:14.170
We need to go in there
and suck it out.

28:14.214 --> 28:16.216
Advancing through
the internal carotid

28:16.259 --> 28:19.132
and through and into
the middle cerebral artery.

28:19.175 --> 28:20.742
- You're right there.

28:20.786 --> 28:24.093
- Performing embolectomy.

28:24.137 --> 28:27.401
- The brain should be
re-perfusing now.

28:27.444 --> 28:29.664
- D-fib arrest!

28:29.708 --> 28:31.666
- Intrathorvacic paddles.

28:31.710 --> 28:33.363
Clear.

28:33.407 --> 28:36.671
- He died on the table.

28:36.715 --> 28:39.152
- What was the cause of death?

28:39.195 --> 28:41.067
- Embolic stroke.

28:41.110 --> 28:43.286
- And what caused the embolism
to his brain?

28:43.330 --> 28:46.725
- Sometimes they just happen.

28:52.818 --> 28:55.298
- You don't think it was
because you just performed

28:55.342 --> 28:58.258
an incredibly invasive
procedure on Mr. Whitney?

28:58.301 --> 28:59.346
- No.

28:59.389 --> 29:01.565
Uh, sometimes embolisms
just happen.

29:01.609 --> 29:04.655
You know, they're a risk
for any surgery.

29:10.444 --> 29:12.751
- Did you make the decision
to go more invasive,

29:12.794 --> 29:14.578
before or after

29:14.622 --> 29:17.756
you learned George Whitney
was a white nationalist.

29:19.801 --> 29:21.716
- Did you make the decision
to go more invasive

29:21.760 --> 29:24.153
before or after you learned
George Whitney was the one

29:24.197 --> 29:25.589
who released the botulism toxin

29:25.633 --> 29:28.201
at the Middle Eastern
Street Fair?

29:42.693 --> 29:45.261
- Next question.

29:52.878 --> 29:54.967
- Dr. Nottingham,
thanks for coming in.

29:55.010 --> 29:56.838
Please take a seat.

30:03.889 --> 30:06.152
I'm not recording this.

30:06.195 --> 30:07.588
No one's gonna get in trouble,

30:07.631 --> 30:10.069
I just need you to tell me
the truth.

30:10.112 --> 30:11.592
- The truth?

30:11.635 --> 30:14.551
- I need you to tell me exactly
what happened in the O.R.

30:14.595 --> 30:16.423
during George Whitney's
LVAD surgery.

30:22.603 --> 30:23.909
- Chest is open.

30:23.952 --> 30:25.998
- Lab results are back.
- And?

30:26.041 --> 30:28.174
- White count 5.2.
Hematocrit 39.

30:28.217 --> 30:30.829
Botulism anti-toxin
276 micrograms--

30:30.872 --> 30:31.960
- Wait.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

30:32.004 --> 30:33.570
276?
- Correct.

30:33.614 --> 30:34.789
- That's twice
the expected level.

30:34.833 --> 30:36.312
Did he get a double dose?

30:36.356 --> 30:38.445
- Maybe he predosed himself
assuming he'd be exposed.

30:38.488 --> 30:39.707
- Why would he do that?

30:39.750 --> 30:41.883
- Maintain paralysis
through a sternotomy.

30:41.927 --> 30:43.580
- Because he's
a white supremacist.

30:43.624 --> 30:45.408
This racist son of a--

30:45.452 --> 30:46.670
he almost killed seven people

30:46.714 --> 30:48.324
and now we have to
save his life.

30:48.368 --> 30:50.979
- Dr. Nottingham, we do not
judge the people on this table,

30:51.023 --> 30:52.981
we just treat them.

30:53.025 --> 30:54.896
- So you realized
George Whitney

30:54.940 --> 30:56.898
was the perpetrator
after you made the decision

30:56.942 --> 31:00.119
to perform the more invasive
LVAD procedure?

31:00.162 --> 31:01.903
- Yes.

31:01.947 --> 31:03.992
Dr. Reynolds had already
cracked the chest

31:04.036 --> 31:06.647
when I saw the tattoo.

31:08.127 --> 31:09.911
- Thank you, Dr. Nottingham.

31:09.955 --> 31:12.044
Uh, you can go.

31:18.224 --> 31:19.921
- Evie, I'm impressed.

31:19.965 --> 31:22.663
You're even interviewing
the residents.

31:22.706 --> 31:25.666
So, what's
the hospital's liability?

31:26.841 --> 31:29.975
- Dr. Goodwin, Dr. Bloom,
and Dr. Reynolds--

31:30.018 --> 31:31.933
none of them caused
George Whitney's death.

31:31.977 --> 31:34.457
- That's good to hear.

31:34.501 --> 31:36.198
- But if I put any of them
on the stand,

31:36.242 --> 31:38.722
the plaintiff's attorney
will rip them to shreds.

31:38.766 --> 31:40.463
- Why?

31:40.507 --> 31:43.249
- They all made choices that
would appear suspect to a jury.

31:43.292 --> 31:45.947
I know this will be
a big pay out,

31:45.991 --> 31:48.863
but to avoid a bigger one,
we need to settle.

31:57.132 --> 31:59.656
- Oh, he's coming in hot.

31:59.700 --> 32:01.223
- Forgive me, Ella,

32:01.267 --> 32:03.747
but your cat cannot enter
our home.

32:03.791 --> 32:05.880
- Why?
- You know me.

32:05.924 --> 32:07.969
I'm--I'm educated,
and reasonable,

32:08.013 --> 32:09.884
and modern, but to a point.

32:09.928 --> 32:13.844
But black cats--wherever
they go, bad luck follows.

32:13.888 --> 32:15.585
- So you're superstitious.

32:15.629 --> 32:18.501
- Yes, and I'm ashamed
to admit it.

32:18.545 --> 32:20.634
Because for you it may be
a silly superstition,

32:20.677 --> 32:21.983
but for me it's real.

32:22.027 --> 32:24.899
The stress this cat
has caused me is unbearable.

32:24.943 --> 32:27.249
- I understand completely.

32:27.293 --> 32:28.903
- You do?

32:28.947 --> 32:31.688
- Unbearable stress
over irrational fears?

32:31.732 --> 32:34.169
That's pretty much how my OCD
makes me feel every single day.

32:34.213 --> 32:35.866
Like, sometimes I think
I'm losing it,

32:35.910 --> 32:38.521
and I would never want you
to feel that way too.

32:38.565 --> 32:43.135
- Does this cat
really help your OCD?

32:43.178 --> 32:46.877
- Yeah, uh, so, um.

32:46.921 --> 32:48.705
Like, if I'm obsessing
over something,

32:48.749 --> 32:50.098
and I can't stop.

32:50.142 --> 32:52.013
Like my pregnancy or what kind
of mom I'm gonna be.

32:52.057 --> 32:54.581
Callie does this little thing
where she flips belly up

32:54.624 --> 32:56.844
and then she tucks her head
under my hand.

32:56.887 --> 32:59.107
It just gives me something else
to focus on.

32:59.151 --> 33:01.109
It--she brings me back
to Earth.

33:03.155 --> 33:05.026
- Then you must keep this cat.

33:06.941 --> 33:08.247
- Really?
Are you sure?

33:08.290 --> 33:10.249
- Yes.
That's my final decision.

33:10.292 --> 33:12.947
But there's one thing
you must do.

33:12.991 --> 33:14.993
Change its name.

33:15.036 --> 33:16.255
- What's wrong with Callie?

33:16.298 --> 33:18.909
- Kali is a sacred
Hindu goddess.

33:18.953 --> 33:21.782
Often associated with
the bloody death of demons.

33:26.961 --> 33:30.269
- I didn't help Megan.
- I didn't help Megan.

33:30.312 --> 33:35.013
- I was scared like a baby.
- I was scared like a baby.

33:36.971 --> 33:39.669
Got it?
Okay, now you mirror me.

33:40.801 --> 33:42.629
I wanted to run to Megan.

33:42.672 --> 33:44.848
- I wanted to run to Megan.

33:44.892 --> 33:47.764
- But I was doing
what the teacher said.

33:47.808 --> 33:50.245
- But I was doing
what the teacher said.

33:50.289 --> 33:53.031
- I did the best that I could.

33:56.947 --> 33:59.298
It's okay.
You can say it.

33:59.341 --> 34:01.778
I did the best I could.

34:02.997 --> 34:05.260
- Yeah, you did.

34:05.304 --> 34:06.609
You see?

34:06.653 --> 34:08.089
The story itself
is less powerful

34:08.133 --> 34:10.135
than the way we tell it,
isn't it?

34:13.442 --> 34:15.096
I'm just...

34:17.664 --> 34:19.274
I'm really sorry.

34:19.318 --> 34:21.711
- For what?

34:21.755 --> 34:24.888
- For all us adults making you
kids deal with this problem

34:24.932 --> 34:26.847
rather than fixing it
ourselves.

34:26.890 --> 34:28.414
That's not fair.
- Yeah.

34:28.457 --> 34:31.765
We've received your
thoughts and prayers, thanks.

34:32.983 --> 34:35.116
- But you know
what gives me hope?

34:35.160 --> 34:37.162
- What?
- You.

34:37.205 --> 34:39.686
You and your whole generation.
You've blown me away.

34:39.729 --> 34:42.819
You're already taking on the
big issues way better than us.

34:42.863 --> 34:44.691
- No pressure.

34:44.734 --> 34:47.172
Yeah, no pressure.

34:47.215 --> 34:50.305
So for now, your only job
is to do the exercises,

34:50.349 --> 34:54.222
and I promise you,
the fear will subside.

34:54.266 --> 34:56.398
You will feel safe again.

34:56.442 --> 34:58.705
We all will.

35:16.201 --> 35:18.942
- I didn't think
I'd ever hear from you again.

35:20.205 --> 35:23.251
- I didn't think
you would either.

35:23.295 --> 35:25.906
- So why did you wanna
meet here?

35:29.039 --> 35:32.913
- I thought maybe we could try
and make some new memories.

35:46.753 --> 35:49.799
- I'm here to tender
my resignation.

35:51.018 --> 35:53.368
- Why--why would you resign?

35:53.412 --> 35:55.762
- My study's been compromised.

35:55.805 --> 35:57.329
- How?

36:00.375 --> 36:02.812
- It's entirely my fault,

36:02.856 --> 36:05.902
but my duties as chair
compromised my focus.

36:05.946 --> 36:08.818
Things fell through the cracks.

36:08.862 --> 36:10.385
- What?
No.

36:10.429 --> 36:12.387
Listen, we can
work something out, okay?

36:12.431 --> 36:14.737
You can start your trial over.
Here.

36:17.131 --> 36:19.742
- No.
Thank you.

36:19.786 --> 36:21.918
I need to be centered
on my research right now,

36:21.962 --> 36:24.182
and I cannot do that here.

36:24.225 --> 36:25.835
- Castro needs to go somewhere

36:25.879 --> 36:27.968
where she can be more vigilant
about her process.

36:28.011 --> 36:31.232
It's an important trial.
People will be watching.

36:31.276 --> 36:33.930
With more scrutiny than ever.

36:37.151 --> 36:38.326
- She's right.

36:40.415 --> 36:42.765
- Okay.
Then, um,

36:42.809 --> 36:45.855
I guess I accept
your resignation,

36:45.899 --> 36:47.857
effective--
- Immediately.

36:49.598 --> 36:51.818
- I'll help her get her things.

36:55.517 --> 36:58.041
After you.

36:58.085 --> 36:59.434
- Be well, Max.

37:11.446 --> 37:14.275
- Why didn't you just tell me
the truth about George Whitney?

37:19.280 --> 37:20.586
- Well, I thought--

37:20.629 --> 37:24.372
- You thought you could just
step out the truth?

37:24.416 --> 37:28.028
Didn't you?

37:28.071 --> 37:31.814
- Whatever you think you know,
you don't.

37:46.351 --> 37:48.266
- TF on one.

37:48.309 --> 37:50.050
- He's the terrorist?

37:50.093 --> 37:51.486
- You're just now
figuring that out?

37:51.530 --> 37:53.140
Pre-dosed himself
with the anti-toxin,

37:53.183 --> 37:55.316
in the event that
he'd be exposed.

37:55.360 --> 37:56.404
- It doesn't look like
it worked too well.

37:56.448 --> 37:58.493
- Nope.
Racist son of a--

37:59.581 --> 38:02.932
Tried to kill seven people,
now we have to save his life.

38:10.375 --> 38:12.464
Sorry, I--

38:12.507 --> 38:15.162
I don't know why, uh--

38:15.205 --> 38:18.557
Just do what we do,
and do it well.

38:20.559 --> 38:22.256
- Why didn't you
just tell me that?

38:22.300 --> 38:24.389
You didn't do anything wrong.

38:25.259 --> 38:27.305
- But I did.

38:27.348 --> 38:30.960
As a role model,
as a leader,

38:31.004 --> 38:34.660
I never should have said
those words.

38:34.703 --> 38:36.531
Not in my O.R.

38:39.578 --> 38:42.058
You know, I remember
the first time knowing

38:42.102 --> 38:44.060
I wanted to be a doctor.

38:44.104 --> 38:46.367
I was learning
about Bessie Smith.

38:46.411 --> 38:48.456
- Empress of Blues.
- Yep.

38:48.500 --> 38:50.371
Died after
being refused service

38:50.415 --> 38:53.374
in an all-white hospital.

38:53.418 --> 38:56.682
Buried in an unmarked grave.

38:59.249 --> 39:01.600
I knew right then that I wanted
to become a doctor,

39:01.643 --> 39:03.341
without prejudice.

39:04.516 --> 39:09.259
And I hate that you or anyone

39:09.303 --> 39:12.001
had to see that
I couldn't do that.

39:12.045 --> 39:14.395
- But you are that.

39:14.439 --> 39:17.006
You live that every day.

39:17.050 --> 39:19.705
That's one of the many reasons
why I'm marrying you.

39:22.708 --> 39:26.320
But let me tell you one thing,
Dr. Reynolds.

39:29.018 --> 39:33.371
If you ever step out the truth
with me...

39:36.635 --> 39:39.986
I will seriously mess you up.

39:51.737 --> 39:53.739
- Okay, what was that?

39:53.782 --> 39:55.349
- Exactly what you saw.

39:55.393 --> 39:57.960
- What I saw
was pure theatrics.

39:58.004 --> 39:59.658
- Max, I handled the situation.

39:59.701 --> 40:02.965
- I can see that, but what
exactly is the situation?

40:03.009 --> 40:04.663
- Well, let's just say that

40:04.706 --> 40:08.057
Castro hasn't changed since
I fired her the last time.

40:08.101 --> 40:09.711
She is a very talented doctor,

40:09.755 --> 40:12.105
but she's always gonna let
ambition get in her way.

40:12.148 --> 40:14.499
- Then why did you
bring her back?

40:14.542 --> 40:18.764
Why did you give her
half your department?

40:23.682 --> 40:26.336
- You have a good night, Max.

40:26.380 --> 40:29.035
- I wanna know.
- I think you already do.

40:33.387 --> 40:35.171
- Then just tell me.

40:35.215 --> 40:38.218
- For God's sake, Max.
