Haxus! I want whoever's
in this ship found and terminated!

01:09.183 --> 01:10.601
Commander Sendak,

01:10.684 --> 01:14.313
I've received a transmission
generating from somewhere inside.

01:15.272 --> 01:17.900
<i>There's not much time
before they get the ship running again.</i>

01:17.983 --> 01:20.486
<i>You must shut off the particle barrier
so we can get in.</i>

01:20.569 --> 01:22.738
<i>You got it.
Tell me what to do.</i>

01:22.821 --> 01:25.241
<i>The particle barrier generator
is beneath the main hull.</i>

01:25.324 --> 01:28.535
She's telling the intruder
how to take down our defenses.

01:28.619 --> 01:32.331
Yes, but she's also giving away
his location.

01:32.414 --> 01:34.875
Find that room. Kill the paladin.

01:36.543 --> 01:38.128
Repair the engine.

01:38.212 --> 01:41.799
Emperor Zarkon has commanded us
to bring him Voltron.

01:41.882 --> 01:44.885
This ship will rise before day's end.

01:51.934 --> 01:55.312
Okay, don't come any closer!
I don't know how to use this very well.

01:58.148 --> 02:00.192
Wait a minute.
You're not Galra.

02:00.276 --> 02:02.403
Nor are you.

02:03.571 --> 02:05.447
A patrol!

02:05.531 --> 02:08.199
Shay, we must take leave
from these ones, now.

02:08.283 --> 02:10.369
Wait, please! We need your help.

02:10.452 --> 02:13.455
- If the Galra find us, they'll kill us.
- Or torture us.

02:13.539 --> 02:17.167
Or keep us as some sort of creepy pet
to play with how they please.

02:17.251 --> 02:18.711
Not our problem, Hairy Lip.

02:18.794 --> 02:21.880
Galra see us near you
and they kill both you and us.

02:21.964 --> 02:23.048
Shay, exeunt!

02:23.132 --> 02:26.969
No! These many years
only Galra have been seen here.

02:27.052 --> 02:29.805
I will not turn my back on the skylings.

02:31.599 --> 02:32.683
Vex!

02:34.143 --> 02:38.022
Grab a side.
In here. Hurry!

02:47.114 --> 02:49.450
Thanks for saving us. I'm Hunk.

02:49.533 --> 02:54.455
Shay. And this one, my brother Rax.
How did you fall to us?

02:54.538 --> 02:56.623
Well, we came looking for something.

02:56.707 --> 02:59.835
And you guys might be
the right people to help us find it.

03:01.086 --> 03:03.505
<i>Pidge, have you made it
to the generator room?</i>

03:04.548 --> 03:08.886
I'm in. This technology is so advanced,
I don't know if I can figure it out.

03:08.969 --> 03:12.181
<i>Yes, you can. The lives
of your fellow paladins are at stake.</i>

03:12.264 --> 03:14.058
<i>You can't give up.</i>

03:14.433 --> 03:16.352
Hope you enjoy
this home-cooked meal, Matt.

03:16.435 --> 03:18.354
After our launch to Kerberos tomorrow,

03:18.437 --> 03:21.357
we'll be eating freeze-dried peas
for the next two months.

03:21.440 --> 03:23.942
Don't lie.
I know you love those peas, Dad.

03:24.026 --> 03:25.652
It's true.

03:25.736 --> 03:27.321
Those Garrison chefs really know

03:27.404 --> 03:30.324
how to genetically manufacture
a delicious vegetable.

03:30.407 --> 03:33.660
I wish I was
going up with you guys.

03:33.744 --> 03:36.017
Just you wait, kiddo.
Something tells me that

03:36.018 --> 03:38.290
you're going to have
your own crew someday.

03:38.374 --> 03:42.461
You're going to fly with them to worlds
so far away, we can't even imagine.

03:42.544 --> 03:45.506
I bet my bottom dollar
you're going to be part of something

03:45.589 --> 03:49.385
that makes the whole universe
sit up and take notice.

03:49.468 --> 03:52.950
<i>The Galaxy Garrison
mission to the distant moon of</i>

03:52.951 --> 03:56.433
Kerberos is missing, and all crew
members are believed to be dead.

03:56.517 --> 04:00.396
<i>The Galaxy Garrison has said the crash
was presumably caused by pilot error.</i>

04:00.479 --> 04:04.233
<i>It is, indeed,
a sad day for all humanity.</i>

04:14.410 --> 04:18.622
You again? Get off my computer!
How did you get past the guards?

04:18.706 --> 04:21.333
You said the spacecraft went down
due to pilot error.

04:21.416 --> 04:23.335
I saw the video feeds from your probes.

04:23.419 --> 04:26.255
There's no evidence of a crash
anywhere on Kerberos!

04:26.338 --> 04:28.215
Those feeds are classified!

04:28.298 --> 04:30.718
I could charge you with treason
for hacking into them.

04:30.801 --> 04:33.178
Where's my family?

04:33.262 --> 04:37.683
Escort Miss Holt off the premises
and make sure every guard knows

04:37.766 --> 04:42.146
she's never allowed
on Garrison property ever again.

04:42.229 --> 04:46.567
You can't keep me out!
I'll find the truth! I'll never stop!

04:48.652 --> 04:50.863
Okay. Talk me through it, Allura.

04:50.946 --> 04:53.490
<i>Shutting down the barrier
from this room can be dangerous.</i>

04:53.574 --> 04:57.911
<i>Remember, the barrier is also a weapon.
So, stay away from the energy arcs.</i>

04:57.995 --> 05:00.372
Don't touch
the giant lightning bolts. Got it.

05:00.456 --> 05:02.875
<i>Now, what I'm going
to need you to do is...</i>

05:02.958 --> 05:06.295
<i>Pidge! Hello?
Are you there?</i>

05:06.378 --> 05:07.838
Pidge, what's going on?

05:09.047 --> 05:12.760
Wait... the mice. Maybe they can help.

05:14.094 --> 05:16.847
<i>Friends, I need your help.</i>

05:33.322 --> 05:37.534
My only way out is two floors up?
Seriously?

05:37.618 --> 05:39.203
Let's try this.

05:40.871 --> 05:42.539
There!

06:04.895 --> 06:07.189
Whoa! Can't believe that worked!

06:11.235 --> 06:13.612
You stay and guard the generator.

06:28.877 --> 06:31.380
The invisible maze.
Let's see them get through this.

07:21.513 --> 07:24.766
Rover. Nice save, buddy.

07:25.517 --> 07:28.312
Thanks for the delicious soup.
Are these potatoes in here?

07:28.395 --> 07:31.148
Grandma's special dish
for special visitors.

07:31.231 --> 07:34.735
Cave-root for the skin.
Cave bugs for the soul.

07:34.818 --> 07:36.737
Oh!

07:36.820 --> 07:38.614
Thank you for the bugs.

07:39.656 --> 07:43.035
- Okay, I think that's too many.
- So, how many of you are down here?

07:43.118 --> 07:47.915
There are thousands here on Balmera.
We work and live in these mines.

07:47.998 --> 07:50.459
We harvest crystals for Zarkon.

07:50.542 --> 07:52.419
Zarkon.

07:52.502 --> 07:56.298
That's so sad
that he's enslaved an entire planet.

07:56.381 --> 08:02.137
Zarkon may rule, but we still have family.
That's where true happiness comes from.

08:04.181 --> 08:07.851
Galra would tear our family asunder
if they found these ones.

08:07.935 --> 08:11.855
Everyone comes to Balmera and takes,
but gives nothing in return.

08:12.731 --> 08:13.774
In the past,

08:13.857 --> 08:17.152
those who took the Balmera's crystals
would replenish her with energy.

08:17.235 --> 08:19.363
It was an equal exchange.

08:19.446 --> 08:21.907
But the Galra only take.

08:21.990 --> 08:24.993
It is no wonder we can feel her suffering.

08:28.789 --> 08:30.958
I'm sorry that we put everyone
in this situation,

08:31.041 --> 08:33.460
but the faster we get the crystal
and get out,

08:33.543 --> 08:35.294
the faster everyone is out of danger.

08:35.379 --> 08:37.547
We're looking
for a battleship-class crystal.

08:37.631 --> 08:41.259
Battleship-class crystal?
Those are most rare.

08:41.342 --> 08:44.930
Galra soldiers guard them ceaselessly
until their harvest.

08:45.013 --> 08:46.682
Your quest is in vain.

08:46.765 --> 08:50.978
There is one, found only weeks ago.
It is almost excavated.

08:51.061 --> 08:51.979
Quiet!

08:52.062 --> 08:54.564
Even if they could steal
the crystal from the Galra,

08:54.648 --> 08:57.109
battle patrols wait
to take down their ship.

08:57.192 --> 08:59.903
These ones have no chance
of getting out of here alive,

08:59.987 --> 09:02.072
with crystal or without.

09:03.657 --> 09:05.117
Okay, so this crystal we need

09:05.200 --> 09:07.619
is basically the hardest thing
in the universe to get.

09:07.703 --> 09:09.162
I don't know about the hardest.

09:09.246 --> 09:12.582
There is the scaultrite mineral found
only in the stomachs of giant weblums.

09:12.666 --> 09:17.337
Collecting that stuff's no picnic.
But, yes, this seems very difficult.

09:17.421 --> 09:20.132
You may stay here
until Balmera gives another crystal.

09:20.215 --> 09:24.177
- One that is hidden from Galra eyes.
- We don't have that kind of time.

09:24.261 --> 09:27.889
I got an injured friend who needs to get
into a magic healing machine, stat.

09:27.973 --> 09:30.726
Hunk, you fix the pod.
I'm going to do some reconnaissance

09:30.809 --> 09:33.228
and see if I can come up
with another plan.

09:48.535 --> 09:49.953
First day of school.

09:51.288 --> 09:52.873
Time for a haircut.

09:59.087 --> 10:01.048
I made it! I'm a fighter pilot.

10:04.843 --> 10:08.513
<i>Hasta la later, Keith!
And look, you're my engineer.</i>

10:08.597 --> 10:11.975
Cool. Uh, can I do that from the ground?

10:13.310 --> 10:16.396
And our communications officer is...

10:16.480 --> 10:20.609
- Who the heck is Pidge Gunderson?
- Right here.

10:22.611 --> 10:26.448
Welcome to the team, Gunderson.
I'm Lance, your fighter pilot.

10:26.531 --> 10:29.417
- Hey, I'm Hunk.
- We got a lot of great times ahead,

10:29.418 --> 10:31.620
so we should probably start bonding now.

10:31.703 --> 10:34.915
<i>Security for the Galaxy Garrison's
mainframe is our first priority.</i>

10:34.998 --> 10:38.085
<i>It's been breached once.
And by a little girl, no less.</i>

10:38.168 --> 10:40.420
It cannot happen again!

10:42.214 --> 10:43.799
Wrong arm, cadet.

10:46.093 --> 10:50.639
Hello?
Pizza? Girls? Astronauts?

10:50.722 --> 10:54.935
Sorry, I don't have time to mess around
with you guys. See you in the simulator.

10:55.018 --> 10:56.645
What's his problem?

11:06.321 --> 11:09.741
You know, Rover, I haven't always
been there for my team.

11:11.118 --> 11:13.411
But this time I will be.

11:15.247 --> 11:16.540
Come on.

11:40.146 --> 11:42.732
Tell me, what is the sky like?

11:42.816 --> 11:47.362
The sky? You seriously have
never even seen the sky?

11:48.280 --> 11:52.868
No... but, at night,
I sneak up as high as I dare,

11:52.951 --> 11:55.453
trying to imagine what it is like.

11:55.537 --> 12:01.751
Oh, lucky are you to fly in this machine
to worlds far from here.

12:01.835 --> 12:05.505
Well, it doesn't have to be like this.
You can be free, too.

12:05.589 --> 12:07.632
- Free?
- Yeah, free.

12:07.716 --> 12:11.553
It means you can go where you want,
be what you want, do what you want.

12:11.636 --> 12:13.889
No Galra masters to tell you what to do.

12:13.972 --> 12:17.851
It makes no sense.
Zarkon controls everything.

12:17.934 --> 12:21.730
Nope. No, things are changing.
Have you heard of Voltron?

12:22.731 --> 12:24.524
A child's tale.

12:25.442 --> 12:30.655
It's real. I'm one of the paladins,
and Voltron is going to defeat Zarkon.

12:31.489 --> 12:32.616
You are?

12:32.699 --> 12:35.744
Stop filling this one's head
with your shadow show!

12:35.827 --> 12:39.456
The cavern is our home.
This will never change.

12:39.539 --> 12:41.082
Come.

12:51.468 --> 12:53.011
Powering sub panels.

12:53.094 --> 12:56.181
<i>Sub panel
energy transducer is go.</i>

12:56.264 --> 12:59.267
Aye, sir. Opening pathway
to link with bridge.

13:01.603 --> 13:04.022
Initializing main cluster reboot.

13:10.028 --> 13:11.321
Gotcha.

13:14.824 --> 13:18.036
Initializing complete.
I'm set for main power up.

13:18.119 --> 13:21.915
<i>- The bridge is go.
- Powering up.</i>

13:21.998 --> 13:24.084
And up, and up, and up.

13:24.167 --> 13:27.545
I would not want to be touching
a metal surface when this thing overloads.

13:27.629 --> 13:29.798
Sir, something is wrong.

13:45.897 --> 13:49.317
You're the one causing
all this trouble? A child?

13:49.401 --> 13:52.946
I'm not a child.
I'm a Paladin of Voltron.

13:53.029 --> 13:57.283
Let me tell you something, child.

13:57.367 --> 14:02.872
I'm a soldier of the Galra Empire.
Nothing stops me but triumph or death.

14:16.136 --> 14:19.472
Nowhere left to run.
Nowhere left to hide.

14:45.081 --> 14:46.374
No!

14:49.753 --> 14:50.879
No!

14:57.218 --> 14:58.845
<i>Haxus, report in.</i>

14:59.846 --> 15:02.265
Haxus is gone, and you're next!

15:02.349 --> 15:06.227
<i>You've slowed me down,
but this ship is mine!</i>

15:06.311 --> 15:08.897
<i>You will turn yourself
over to me immediately!</i>

15:08.980 --> 15:10.148
Never!

15:10.231 --> 15:13.610
<i>Well, then, maybe your leader
can convince you.</i>

15:14.319 --> 15:16.154
<i>What do you want?</i>

15:16.446 --> 15:18.948
Your friend wanted to hear from you.

15:19.032 --> 15:21.368
<i>- Shiro?
- Pidge? Pidge, don't listen to...</i>

15:24.537 --> 15:25.538
No!

15:27.582 --> 15:30.585
<i>You can make it stop.
Turn yourself in.</i>

15:30.668 --> 15:33.004
<i>His suffering is in your hands.</i>

15:35.507 --> 15:37.926
Is your ship repaired
that you may depart our presence?

15:38.009 --> 15:40.470
Uh, are you saying
that you want us to leave?

15:40.553 --> 15:41.679
Yes.

15:42.764 --> 15:46.101
Well, it's working,
but we can't leave without the crystal.

15:46.184 --> 15:48.603
You come up with any ideas
how to get it?

15:48.686 --> 15:50.438
Actually, yes.

15:55.652 --> 15:57.570
I can't believe
I'm the legs again.

15:57.654 --> 16:01.282
I'm the one who took down the guard.
I should get to be the head.

16:01.366 --> 16:03.034
Shh!
Legs don't talk.

16:06.037 --> 16:09.874
Oh, hello, gentlemen, shift's over.
Boss needs you back at the guard shack.

16:11.584 --> 16:14.754
- Verify identification code.
- Right. I didn't want to have to do this,

16:14.838 --> 16:16.756
but I'm going to have to pull rank.

16:16.840 --> 16:18.967
You guys are in big trouble, right?

16:19.050 --> 16:21.761
So, hand over those blasters
and ID badges.

16:22.595 --> 16:25.765
Verify identification code
or be destroyed.

16:25.849 --> 16:29.269
Okay, okay. I've got it right... here!

16:39.320 --> 16:41.239
What are you doing? We got to hurry!

16:41.322 --> 16:44.701
I'm not just going to pry this out of here
like some Galra monster.

16:44.784 --> 16:48.705
The Balmera is a sacred being.
You have to communicate with it.

16:48.788 --> 16:52.625
Let your life forces connect.
This is the way it was done in our time.

16:52.709 --> 16:54.752
Whoa. You really know your Balmeras.

17:10.768 --> 17:13.396
I think I'm broken.

17:13.480 --> 17:15.272
Huh?

17:18.108 --> 17:21.613
Okay, guys!
All right, I hate to do this.

17:21.695 --> 17:24.240
Blasters and badges.
Come on. Give them up.

17:29.120 --> 17:31.539
I'm impressed
that you managed to escape.

17:31.623 --> 17:34.042
Perhaps it would be worth
the trip to your planet

17:34.125 --> 17:36.794
to see if the rest of your kind
have your spirit.

17:37.295 --> 17:41.883
Of course, they will all end up broken,
just like you.

17:41.966 --> 17:47.931
Now that we have Voltron, every planet,
every race, all share the same fate.

17:49.224 --> 17:52.644
<i>Quiznak! I can't believe
they saw through our disguise.</i>

17:52.727 --> 17:54.562
Someone's coming.

17:56.147 --> 17:57.148
Shay?

18:02.654 --> 18:05.532
Make haste to your pod.
The crystal is prepared for departure.

18:05.615 --> 18:07.450
How did you get the crystal?

18:07.534 --> 18:09.953
I was assigned to take it
to the upper levels,

18:10.036 --> 18:11.538
but instead I took it down.

18:11.621 --> 18:14.499
Soon, they will discover my ruse.
Time is short.

18:15.166 --> 18:17.418
Why are you helping us?
You'll get in trouble.

18:17.502 --> 18:19.879
Because your words touched my heart.

18:19.963 --> 18:25.093
I wish for freedom for all Balmera.
Perhaps your Voltron can make it so.

18:35.645 --> 18:38.481
No. Rax, why?

18:38.565 --> 18:41.234
These two bring only trouble
to our family.

18:41.317 --> 18:43.236
It was the only way to protect you.

18:44.028 --> 18:47.490
No!
The Balmera will save us.

18:49.492 --> 18:51.244
Shay, no!

19:11.848 --> 19:15.977
- Shay!
- Go! Make haste!

19:16.060 --> 19:18.646
- Let her go!
- No, Hunk! We have to go!

19:24.485 --> 19:27.238
I'll come back for you, Shay! I promise!

19:31.367 --> 19:35.204
<i>If we can't shake these patrols,
we might be back here sooner than we want!</i>

20:08.529 --> 20:11.282
- It worked!
- They did it!

20:28.299 --> 20:30.385
Shiro, wake up. It's me, Pidge.

20:32.679 --> 20:36.140
You really thought your little
hologram trick would work with me?

20:42.271 --> 20:43.523
Stand back!

20:57.829 --> 20:58.996
No!

21:10.758 --> 21:11.759
Keith, now!

21:23.563 --> 21:25.565
Lance, are you okay?

21:26.607 --> 21:29.819
We did it. We are a good team.

21:35.742 --> 21:38.327
We can't shake them!
We're not going to make it!

21:42.081 --> 21:47.044
- Uh, it may turn us into a giant fireball.
- Maybe, but it's our only chance.

21:49.213 --> 21:51.007
Fine. Fire in the hole!

22:02.351 --> 22:04.729
<i>We did it!</i>

22:12.904 --> 22:16.407
After a day in here,
he should be fully healed.

22:17.575 --> 22:20.912
Pidge, we can't thank you enough
for all you did.

22:20.995 --> 22:24.832
I can't help but feel that you were
meant to be a part of our team...

22:25.208 --> 22:27.293
but I understand if you want to leave.

22:28.085 --> 22:31.214
Dad used to tell me how close he was
with his crew members.

22:32.381 --> 22:34.258
They were like family.

22:34.342 --> 22:36.677
Now, I understand
what he was talking about.

22:37.887 --> 22:42.433
I'm staying with you guys.
Let's stop Zarkon for all of our families.

22:43.476 --> 22:45.436
Good to have you back on the team.
