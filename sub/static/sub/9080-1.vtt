03:38.151 --> 03:39.812
- Son of a bitch.
- What are you doing?

03:40.019 --> 03:42.419
There's a goddamn raccoon
in the middle of the road.

03:43.056 --> 03:45.149
Jesus.

03:45.358 --> 03:48.919
Well, better to kill us than get
a little roadkill on the car, huh?

03:49.562 --> 03:51.120
Well, we're still alive.

03:51.331 --> 03:54.630
I can tell by the pissy look
that you're giving me.

04:21.293 --> 04:23.387
- This isn't the interstate.
- There was a wreck.

04:23.596 --> 04:26.030
It was all backed up.
I took a shortcut.

04:26.232 --> 04:27.961
To where?

04:29.602 --> 04:32.264
- Can you hear that?
- Hear what?

04:32.472 --> 04:34.906
I think the engine just made a noise.

04:35.108 --> 04:37.303
Well, it's kind of late
for a breakdown.

04:37.510 --> 04:39.774
Should've stopped somewhere
earlier.

04:39.979 --> 04:41.708
I popped some of those trucker pills.

04:41.914 --> 04:44.109
I thought I could make it
the whole way.

04:46.586 --> 04:48.315
Where are we?

04:52.058 --> 04:55.118
You were really dreaming
over there earlier.

04:55.328 --> 04:57.125
You were mumbling
and jerking around.

04:58.064 --> 04:59.861
I dreamt you were trying to kill me.

05:01.467 --> 05:03.435
We were at my parents'
anniversary party...

05:03.636 --> 05:06.002
...and my mother
wouldn't stop talking.

05:06.673 --> 05:10.165
You started screaming you couldn't
take it and then tried to strangle me.

05:11.110 --> 05:13.169
At least you were
dreaming about me, right?

05:13.379 --> 05:15.040
That's kind of an improvement.

05:15.748 --> 05:18.216
- Shit.
- Jesus.

05:19.419 --> 05:20.647
You okay?

05:21.888 --> 05:24.322
I keep telling you
how stupid that is to do that.

05:24.524 --> 05:28.290
You ought to just kind of bite into
the apple like the rest of the world.

05:28.494 --> 05:31.156
- It hurts my teeth.
- As bad as cutting your finger off?

05:31.397 --> 05:33.024
It's not anything.

05:34.167 --> 05:37.796
- You want me to drive for a while?
- No. I don't.

05:38.004 --> 05:40.939
Why don't you just go ahead
and go back to sleep?

06:09.435 --> 06:12.700
Remember how Charlie used to dance
when there was no music playing--?

06:12.905 --> 06:14.930
I'm tired, David.

06:35.995 --> 06:38.520
See, I think that should be us
just about there.

06:40.600 --> 06:42.898
Why didn't you just
stay on the interstate?

06:47.273 --> 06:48.865
I don't know.

06:49.075 --> 06:52.772
Guess I just wanted to make this
as miserable as possible, you know?

06:52.979 --> 06:56.142
See just how big a bitch
you'd be about it.

07:03.389 --> 07:06.222
I just thought it would be faster,
you know?

07:15.134 --> 07:16.658
Shit.

07:19.272 --> 07:20.899
Is that something?

07:39.058 --> 07:41.049
Do you think they're closed?

07:41.260 --> 07:43.160
Since 1957.

07:43.362 --> 07:46.991
That's too bad,
because they got good gas prices.

07:51.604 --> 07:55.802
- Look, if you're too tired, I'll drive.
- I told you, I'm fine.

08:00.179 --> 08:03.808
Okay. See, that town there, Elida.

08:04.016 --> 08:07.679
You were asleep, but we went
through there about three hours ago.

08:07.887 --> 08:10.014
Well, that should put us
down here somewhere.

08:10.223 --> 08:13.784
I mean, that's a town. Downey. I mean,
they would have a real gas station.

08:13.993 --> 08:15.517
If that's really where we are.

08:15.728 --> 08:19.528
I think that we're headed south.
I mean, eventually, we've got to hit a--

08:19.732 --> 08:21.893
- Oh, my God.
- Sorry.

08:22.101 --> 08:23.568
- Oh, my God.
- Sorry.

08:24.170 --> 08:26.968
- It's okay.
- You got to me before I headed out.

08:27.173 --> 08:28.936
- I'm sorry.
- I gotta warn you, though.

08:29.141 --> 08:32.042
The gas price is a little steeper
than the sign says.

08:32.245 --> 08:35.645
Actually, we're just--
We're having some engine problems.

08:35.847 --> 08:38.009
Yeah, he dodged a squirrel
a few miles back.

08:38.217 --> 08:40.378
- It's a raccoon, yeah.
- And we're lost.

08:40.586 --> 08:43.578
Well, she's lost.
I actually know exactly where we are.

08:43.789 --> 08:45.416
We're on our way to Downey.

08:50.696 --> 08:53.460
He's trying to tell you
it's the other way, David.

08:53.666 --> 08:55.930
- Yeah. Sorry, man.
- It's okay.

08:56.135 --> 08:59.400
It's really easy to get turned around
out here without a map.

09:03.075 --> 09:06.841
- Downey's, like, 30 miles back, man.
- Really?

09:07.346 --> 09:09.246
Look, I'll tell you what. Pop the hood.

09:09.448 --> 09:12.144
I'll check the engine
and make sure you can get that far.

09:12.351 --> 09:16.481
- Really? Thanks. Okay, great.
- Great. Thank you so much.

09:21.794 --> 09:26.288
Yeah, I went off the road there
when I missed the raccoon.

09:26.499 --> 09:28.899
I think I hit a low spot.

09:54.627 --> 09:56.857
Yeah. Thanks, man.

10:01.767 --> 10:03.735
Is he gonna fix it?

10:08.841 --> 10:12.743
- What do you think?
- Well, the fan blade's bent.

10:12.945 --> 10:14.572
Rock must have hit it.

10:15.881 --> 10:18.907
Yeah, she'll drive fine, just noisy,
that's all.

10:19.118 --> 10:22.679
You wanna have someone take a look
when you get where you're going.

10:22.888 --> 10:25.448
I'll do that. Thanks.
So now, what do I owe you?

10:25.658 --> 10:28.126
Oh, no, nothing. No, we're good.

10:28.327 --> 10:32.161
Hell, I should pay you
for finally giving me something to do.

10:33.866 --> 10:35.493
Do you need help
getting to Downey?

10:35.701 --> 10:36.998
- Yes.
- Well, actually...

10:37.203 --> 10:40.536
...if you could just point us
towards the interstate, that'd be great.

10:42.375 --> 10:45.401
- Well, you don't want Downey, then.
- Okay.

10:45.611 --> 10:48.739
I'll tell you what you do.
You take this road here, right?

10:48.948 --> 10:52.748
And you follow it down until you hit
a grove of trees on your right.

10:52.952 --> 10:56.080
You take that.
Keep going until you hit Westcliff.

10:56.288 --> 10:58.085
- It'll be a four-lane there.
- Westcliff.

10:58.290 --> 11:01.817
Make a left on that and that'll
take you where you need to be.

11:02.028 --> 11:04.690
- Okay. Thank you.
- Perfect. Thanks a lot.

11:04.897 --> 11:08.492
And you know what? Man, I'd feel
a lot better if you just took this.

11:08.701 --> 11:11.795
Thanks for staying out so late
and helping us.

11:13.572 --> 11:18.202
Well, you just bought yourself
a $20 sparkly, then.

11:18.411 --> 11:20.572
Because every day's
4th of July's at Small's.

11:22.248 --> 11:24.375
Owner makes me say that.

11:25.751 --> 11:28.982
- Here you go.
- Oh, my gosh. Thank you.

11:29.188 --> 11:31.520
- And drive careful.
- Okay, thanks.

11:52.778 --> 11:56.111
Guess I ought to buy you
a box of those sparklers, huh?

12:06.225 --> 12:08.819
So how far did he say
this Westcliff place is?

12:09.028 --> 12:12.225
He didn't. And I can't even find it
on the fucking map.

12:13.165 --> 12:15.133
- David.
- What, did we hit something?

12:15.334 --> 12:18.462
- That's fucking... .
- Yeah, probably another squirrel.

12:19.238 --> 12:22.071
- You know, it was a fucking raccoon.
- Whatever.

12:22.274 --> 12:24.799
I mean, Jesus Christ,
why do you have--

12:25.911 --> 12:28.607
Oh, what the hell?

12:36.989 --> 12:38.547
Son of a bitch.

12:43.262 --> 12:44.422
Son of a bitch.

12:44.630 --> 12:46.928
So much for being able to
drive it the whole way.

12:47.133 --> 12:50.159
God. Perfect. No signal.

12:50.369 --> 12:51.563
Damn it.

12:51.771 --> 12:55.537
- Can't a car run without a fan?
- Evidently not.

13:19.565 --> 13:21.863
Okay, give it a try for me, all right?

13:22.201 --> 13:23.463
It's not gonna work.

13:23.669 --> 13:25.136
Jesus Christ.

13:25.337 --> 13:28.773
Would you just give it a try for me,
please, honey?

13:36.382 --> 13:38.612
Goddamn it.

13:42.855 --> 13:44.982
So how far back was the gas station?

13:45.191 --> 13:47.182
I don't know. About a mile?

13:47.393 --> 13:49.190
A long walk
in the middle of the night.

13:49.395 --> 13:51.363
Yeah. I guess we could
just sit here...

13:51.564 --> 13:55.125
...and hope some idiots like us
come along and give us a hand, huh?

13:55.334 --> 13:56.824
I didn't get us lost.

13:57.036 --> 14:01.996
No. You slept for 300 miles,
thanks to your Zoloft-Prozac cocktail.

14:15.087 --> 14:16.748
Fuck!

14:23.696 --> 14:24.993
Well...

14:26.065 --> 14:28.397
...at least we know there's
someplace back there.

14:28.601 --> 14:30.865
Oh, yeah, the guy that helped us
so much before.

14:31.070 --> 14:34.369
Well, you know,
you could get another sparkler, Amy.

14:34.640 --> 14:37.370
- Asshole.
- Whatever you say.

14:37.576 --> 14:39.407
Grow a penis.

15:10.209 --> 15:14.236
Never see stars anymore.
At least not in L.A.

15:14.446 --> 15:16.914
Kind of nice out here, really.

15:17.116 --> 15:19.414
I bet Charlie would have liked it.

15:19.785 --> 15:22.276
We should've brought him
sometime.

15:22.488 --> 15:25.116
We never went anywhere.
The job was always too important.

15:25.324 --> 15:26.814
- Why do you do that?
- What?

15:27.026 --> 15:29.494
Every time I mention his name,
you take a shot at me.

15:29.695 --> 15:31.822
- Stop mentioning his name.
- I'm not like you.

15:32.031 --> 15:34.591
I'd rather just remember him
and deal with the pain.

15:34.800 --> 15:37.428
Okay, you know what, David?
Do what you want.

15:56.088 --> 15:58.784
He said he was getting ready
to close, remember?

16:00.225 --> 16:01.749
Shit.

16:01.961 --> 16:03.929
Look, let's just go back to the car.

16:04.129 --> 16:07.895
You can sleep on the hood and
stare up at the stars you love so much.

16:08.467 --> 16:11.163
Maybe they'll know
where we can find the guy.

16:12.905 --> 16:14.873
Oh, God.

16:44.236 --> 16:46.204
You've got to be kidding me.

16:51.010 --> 16:52.568
What is that?

16:53.379 --> 16:55.313
- I want to go.
- No.

16:56.682 --> 16:58.206
It's okay.

17:01.420 --> 17:03.217
Let's go to the car.
What are you doing?

17:03.422 --> 17:05.617
Don't ring the bell.

17:16.535 --> 17:18.093
Sorry.

17:19.038 --> 17:20.403
- Hey, folks.
- Hi.

17:20.606 --> 17:22.335
How can I help you?

17:22.540 --> 17:25.009
Everything okay back there?

17:29.748 --> 17:32.273
- Can we just--? Can we just go?
- It's okay.

17:33.485 --> 17:34.918
Sorry.

17:35.287 --> 17:37.755
Things get a little boring
around here late nights.

17:37.956 --> 17:39.389
I believe that.

17:39.591 --> 17:41.923
Say, there's a mechanic
at the garage over there.

17:42.127 --> 17:44.459
He helped us with our car earlier.
You know him?

17:45.464 --> 17:47.455
I think he's gone home for the night.

17:47.666 --> 17:49.600
He'll probably be back
tomorrow morning.

17:49.802 --> 17:52.168
I was wondering
if you could get in touch with him.

17:52.371 --> 17:54.839
The car actually broke down
two miles back there.

17:55.040 --> 17:56.268
We just walked up here.

17:56.475 --> 17:59.638
I sure can't. I sure can't. I'm sorry.

17:59.845 --> 18:02.541
Do you know another garage?

18:04.683 --> 18:08.016
There's Clark's...

18:08.220 --> 18:11.053
...about 20 miles east.
- Okay.

18:11.256 --> 18:13.986
May I borrow your phone?
I'd like to give them a call...

18:14.193 --> 18:16.593
...see if they can maybe
come and give us a hand.

18:16.795 --> 18:18.626
All I got's a pay phone,
right out there.

18:19.998 --> 18:21.465
- That's great.
- Works on dimes...

18:21.667 --> 18:23.828
...if you need them.
- Okay, I do.

18:32.044 --> 18:33.602
It's real.

18:43.122 --> 18:45.920
No, It doesn't have to be
exact change.

19:06.678 --> 19:08.077
Thank you.

19:11.316 --> 19:12.442
Trouble is...

19:13.752 --> 19:16.084
...Clark's won't be open either.

19:16.388 --> 19:17.787
Not this late.

19:17.990 --> 19:19.821
So I guess I don't need these, huh?

19:20.025 --> 19:22.255
Not if you need a garage.

19:22.461 --> 19:24.952
Yeah. We do.

19:25.330 --> 19:28.629
But like I said, guy over there
will be back around 8...

19:28.834 --> 19:30.131
...if you can wait that long.

19:30.335 --> 19:31.996
I'm sure he can get you running.

19:32.204 --> 19:34.638
Meanwhile, I'm wide open here.

19:35.274 --> 19:36.468
Shocking.

19:36.675 --> 19:39.041
Okay. Thanks.

19:41.346 --> 19:43.712
Well, we can either stay here...

19:43.916 --> 19:45.816
...or we walk all the way
back to the car.

19:46.018 --> 19:49.078
David, this is a fucking nightmare.
I don't know.

19:49.288 --> 19:51.688
Yeah, we'll go ahead and stay here.
Thanks.

19:51.890 --> 19:55.382
I'll give you two the honeymoon suite
for $5 extra.

19:55.594 --> 19:57.391
It's got a few perks the others don't.

19:57.596 --> 19:59.393
A regular room will be fine.
Thank you.

19:59.598 --> 20:01.395
I'll give it for the same rate.

20:01.600 --> 20:03.693
Well, whatever works.
Whatever's fastest.

20:05.737 --> 20:07.830
All right, I'll give you my card.

20:08.040 --> 20:10.440
We're not set up for plastic here,
friend. Cash only.

20:10.642 --> 20:14.009
Okay. I got cash.

20:14.213 --> 20:16.807
I guess you don't take dimes,
though, do you?

20:21.320 --> 20:22.787
Just kidding around.

20:23.989 --> 20:26.014
I'm gonna need to see ID
on one of you.

20:26.225 --> 20:28.090
Sort of a deposit
on the room's contents--

20:28.293 --> 20:31.729
Look, sir, we're-- You can trust us.
We're not gonna steal anything.

20:31.930 --> 20:33.864
I'm not lugging
a bunch of dirty towels...

20:34.066 --> 20:35.966
...back to the car
in the morning, so... .

20:36.168 --> 20:40.696
I'm-- I'm-- I'm sure you won't,
but rules are rules.

20:40.906 --> 20:43.306
I don't make them.
I'm just a manager.

20:43.508 --> 20:44.873
Of course. Here you go.

20:49.081 --> 20:50.810
It's right on the corner, Number 4.

20:51.016 --> 20:53.143
Might have to jiggle the handle
to open her.

20:53.352 --> 20:54.944
She's as sticky as an old whore.

20:55.887 --> 20:57.479
- Right.
- Excuse my language, ma'am.

20:57.689 --> 20:59.623
Y'all have a great night.

20:59.825 --> 21:01.918
See you later. Thank you.

21:51.176 --> 21:53.110
Oh, this is great.

22:03.755 --> 22:05.188
Good thing we upgraded.

22:43.495 --> 22:45.360
We've had our tetanus shots, right?

22:45.564 --> 22:47.998
Oh, hey, if you wanna know
what's on March of '97...

22:48.200 --> 22:50.134
...I got the answer.

23:01.546 --> 23:02.911
I'm sleeping in my clothes.

23:04.282 --> 23:05.772
I'm gonna sleep in my shoes.

23:09.688 --> 23:11.849
I guess it could be worse, you know.

23:12.057 --> 23:14.548
We could be in that twin bed
at your folks' house...

23:14.760 --> 23:17.228
...trying to pretend like
we're a happy couple.

23:21.299 --> 23:24.530
God, I should have
told my mom about us.

23:24.736 --> 23:26.727
Why ruin their party, though?

23:26.938 --> 23:32.240
I think the thing to do is just tell them
after we've signed the papers.

23:34.346 --> 23:37.713
It felt really strange
to be at that party.

23:38.383 --> 23:43.411
Watching them all celebrate
being together all those years.

23:46.358 --> 23:47.882
How did it make you feel?

23:50.662 --> 23:51.959
I don't know.

23:53.732 --> 23:55.529
Tired.

24:00.672 --> 24:02.299
Yeah.

24:09.214 --> 24:11.079
I'm sorry.

24:22.060 --> 24:24.324
Never should've gotten off
the interstate, either.

24:26.231 --> 24:30.565
And miss our one last great
adventure together?

24:32.137 --> 24:33.764
Yeah.

24:48.153 --> 24:49.142
David.

24:50.021 --> 24:51.545
Sorry.

24:53.959 --> 24:55.483
Concierge.

24:57.762 --> 24:59.093
Hello?

25:00.532 --> 25:01.521
Hello.

25:03.201 --> 25:05.101
There's no one there.

25:05.737 --> 25:07.068
Jesus Christ.

25:08.907 --> 25:11.137
What the hell is that?

25:26.591 --> 25:28.115
Hello?

25:35.300 --> 25:36.494
You heard that, right?

25:38.803 --> 25:40.532
Don't touch that.

25:45.043 --> 25:46.772
Who is it?

25:50.682 --> 25:52.172
- Stay there.
- David, wait.

25:56.321 --> 25:57.788
Yeah?

26:06.898 --> 26:08.229
David, don't.

26:08.767 --> 26:10.701
It's coming from
the room next door, Amy.

26:10.902 --> 26:12.563
I know. Don't open it.

26:28.620 --> 26:30.781
Yeah, what do you need?

26:35.226 --> 26:36.750
Hello?

26:39.998 --> 26:42.967
When we walked over here,
were there any cars in the parking lot?

26:43.168 --> 26:44.658
Just check.

26:50.442 --> 26:51.773
There's a truck.

26:51.977 --> 26:54.810
It's probably the manager guy's.

27:02.487 --> 27:06.856
I don't know what the deal is,
but it's a little late for this shit, okay?

27:07.058 --> 27:08.184
So--

27:09.961 --> 27:11.826
Close the door, David.

27:16.868 --> 27:18.358
Close the door.

27:19.571 --> 27:22.335
- Damn it. Why mess with them?
- I'm not messing with them.

27:22.540 --> 27:25.270
I'm just trying to figure out
what they're doing.

27:26.678 --> 27:28.168
Just wait there.

27:35.020 --> 27:37.079
Who is it?

27:57.308 --> 28:00.368
I don't know what your problem is,
asshole.

28:01.813 --> 28:05.305
How long can they fucking
go on with this? Goddamn it.

28:07.452 --> 28:08.817
Oh, David, don't.

28:09.020 --> 28:12.217
I'm gonna call the manager
and tell him someone's bothering us.

28:25.637 --> 28:27.434
Why don't you open the door?

28:30.075 --> 28:32.600
Play some games?
I'll play some fucking games with you.

28:38.450 --> 28:40.884
That's real funny, jerk-off.

28:41.920 --> 28:43.649
- Lock the door.
- Where are you going?

28:43.855 --> 28:46.016
I'm gonna go take care of this prick.

29:14.819 --> 29:16.650
Everything all right, Mr. Fox?

29:16.855 --> 29:19.585
No, because the asshole
in the room right beside us...

29:19.791 --> 29:21.986
...keeps banging on the walls
and he won't stop.

29:22.193 --> 29:23.558
You got any ideas?

29:23.762 --> 29:26.754
- The room beside you?
- Yeah, Room 3.

29:26.965 --> 29:29.433
I go over to talk to the guy
to get him to stop...

29:29.634 --> 29:31.261
...but he just keeps doing it.

29:31.469 --> 29:34.905
So I gotta say,
I don't know what his problem is.

29:35.106 --> 29:38.906
Now, that is very strange
seeing as you folks...

29:39.110 --> 29:41.271
...are the only guests
I got in here tonight.

29:41.479 --> 29:45.074
Well, somebody's in there, okay?
And I gotta say, I'm pretty exhausted.

29:45.283 --> 29:47.547
You sure it's Room 3?

29:47.752 --> 29:50.016
Yeah, we're in the corner, right?
Number 4?

29:50.221 --> 29:53.748
Well, it's the room right beside us,
with the big rusty 3 on it, okay?

29:53.958 --> 29:57.052
- So I'm pretty sure.
- Okay, okay.

29:57.962 --> 30:01.420
Every once in a blue moon,
a college kid or drifter...

30:01.633 --> 30:04.534
...will sneak in through the window
for a good night's sleep.

30:04.736 --> 30:08.638
The cleaning lady will find trash
on the floor or shit in the toilet.

30:08.840 --> 30:11.502
Usually they don't cause much
of a disturbance, so... .

30:11.709 --> 30:14.337
- Well, this one is, okay?
- Let me go check it out for you.

30:14.546 --> 30:17.447
And if those work,
I'd think about bringing one.

30:19.150 --> 30:22.517
- I am ass-tired of shooting at crows.
- Give me a hand.

30:42.473 --> 30:44.031
Fuck it.

30:45.276 --> 30:46.106
It's okay.

30:50.949 --> 30:52.746
So, what happened?
What did he say?

30:52.951 --> 30:56.614
He just thinks it's some drunk.
He's gonna take care of it.

30:56.955 --> 30:58.855
- Did you hear anything else?
- No.

30:59.057 --> 31:01.457
I was hoping I would
and I'd know what they were.

31:01.659 --> 31:06.460
I'm sure they just saw me walk
over there and then they took off.

31:06.664 --> 31:11.101
Now we get to enjoy this luxury resort
in peace and quiet.

31:11.302 --> 31:13.202
David, maybe we should just leave.

31:14.672 --> 31:16.333
Just go back to the car.

31:16.541 --> 31:19.601
I'm not gonna walk anymore tonight,
okay?

31:19.811 --> 31:22.041
Let's just gut it out here
for a few hours.

31:22.247 --> 31:25.444
We'll get the car fixed and we can
just get the hell out of here.

31:25.683 --> 31:26.843
- Okay?
- Okay.

31:27.051 --> 31:28.416
Okay.

31:33.491 --> 31:36.085
You're not watching that right now?

31:36.327 --> 31:37.794
Well, why?

31:37.996 --> 31:40.430
Look, I'm just gonna unwind
a little bit.

31:40.632 --> 31:44.466
And make sure the guy
from next door is gone.

31:44.669 --> 31:48.765
You gotta take advantage of the perks.
It's worth the extra 5 bucks.

31:51.442 --> 31:53.137
Or is it?

31:54.245 --> 31:56.076
- God.
- Shit.

31:56.281 --> 31:57.646
What is it?

31:57.849 --> 32:01.478
- This bathroom's disgusting.
- Yeah?

32:01.953 --> 32:03.420
- David?
- Yes?

32:04.289 --> 32:06.621
That manager guy's definitely
gone over there?

32:06.824 --> 32:08.985
Yeah, with a six-shooter.

32:09.193 --> 32:12.253
He's gonna take care of it,
so just relax.

32:12.463 --> 32:15.626
Gotta make sure his only two guests
are happy.

32:17.268 --> 32:19.793
This looks like a real library
of classics.

32:28.346 --> 32:30.746
<i>Come on. One more.</i>

32:30.949 --> 32:32.280
Jesus.

32:32.483 --> 32:35.418
Bet this really gets the
honeymooners in the mood.

32:38.623 --> 32:41.387
Can you turn that off?
It's the last thing I need right now.

32:41.592 --> 32:44.288
Well, the least they could do
is give us a little porn.

32:51.402 --> 32:54.303
Can't you just mute it or something,
so I don't have to hear it?

33:01.679 --> 33:03.374
<i>You get the fuck out of here.</i>

33:11.923 --> 33:14.050
<i>Susan!</i>

33:28.606 --> 33:30.471
What...?

33:37.315 --> 33:39.249
I told you to turn it off.

33:39.450 --> 33:41.782
<i>Just get away from us!</i>

33:47.959 --> 33:49.517
What is it?

33:52.663 --> 33:54.187
David?

33:58.202 --> 34:01.103
Do you see that room?
From the movie?

34:02.306 --> 34:03.500
What about it?

34:17.621 --> 34:21.284
- What movie is that?
- I don't fucking know.

34:41.746 --> 34:43.373
Fuck me.

34:43.581 --> 34:45.674
David, is that this room?

34:47.085 --> 34:49.518
It sure looks like it.

34:51.522 --> 34:54.422
This has to be
some kind of joke, right?

34:58.629 --> 35:00.961
I mean, it can't be real.

35:02.433 --> 35:04.560
That can't be real.

35:10.108 --> 35:11.507
<i>Steven.</i>

35:13.010 --> 35:15.911
<i>No, get back here. Oh, God.</i>

35:22.753 --> 35:24.812
<i>No! No!</i>

35:25.022 --> 35:26.319
Oh, my God.

35:30.128 --> 35:31.561
What happened?

35:34.699 --> 35:36.098
- It's okay.
- Oh, my God.

35:36.300 --> 35:38.291
It's okay.

35:55.820 --> 35:57.481
<i>Help!</i>

36:07.331 --> 36:09.265
I'm calling the police.

36:13.738 --> 36:16.400
- Shit.
- We gotta get out of here, all right?

36:16.607 --> 36:19.576
All right, let's go. Wait, hold on.

36:19.777 --> 36:22.075
Whoever was outside,
they heard the TV, right?

36:22.280 --> 36:23.645
So they know we watched it.

36:23.848 --> 36:25.713
That asshole put us in here
to watch it.

36:25.983 --> 36:28.042
He was never gonna help.
He was part of it.

36:28.252 --> 36:31.847
So they know we fucking watched it.
They know we're gonna try to run.

36:32.056 --> 36:35.048
- Maybe they don't know we caught on.
- No, wait a second.

36:35.259 --> 36:39.821
- He knows, okay? He knows.
- So, what now?

36:43.935 --> 36:45.562
We'll climb out this way. Come on.

36:47.271 --> 36:49.501
It's fucking nailed shut.

36:51.475 --> 36:53.739
They'll hear you.
Let's just sneak out the door.

36:53.945 --> 36:56.971
They're not just gonna let us
stroll out there and call the cops.

36:57.181 --> 36:59.081
They're not gonna let us
sit here, either.

36:59.550 --> 37:01.347
Fuck.

37:06.891 --> 37:08.085
- David.
- What?

37:08.292 --> 37:09.953
Did you bring this?

37:11.596 --> 37:13.188
No.

37:13.431 --> 37:16.127
- I didn't bring it.
- Didn't you bring that from the car?

37:16.334 --> 37:18.802
No, I bled all over it.
I wouldn't have brought it.

37:19.003 --> 37:20.470
I left it in the car.

37:22.940 --> 37:25.568
- What's happening?
- I don't know.

37:43.394 --> 37:45.328
Well, how'd it get in here?

37:45.529 --> 37:47.053
I don't know.

37:47.265 --> 37:48.960
Dim the lights.

37:49.367 --> 37:51.062
What are we doing?

37:51.836 --> 37:53.326
We're leaving.

37:58.142 --> 38:02.238
Okay, when we get outside,
we're gonna go to the trees, okay?

38:02.747 --> 38:04.612
Where they can't see us.

38:06.417 --> 38:09.614
We gotta move fast, Amy. Okay?

38:29.373 --> 38:32.604
Okay. Okay, we're gonna run
right over there, all right?

38:32.810 --> 38:35.005
Just stay with me.

38:47.158 --> 38:48.819
- Oh, my God.
- Come on.

38:53.364 --> 38:54.456
- Fuck.
- Oh, God.

38:59.570 --> 39:01.003
Come on.

39:26.597 --> 39:29.259
- Get the bathroom window open.
- But it's nailed shut.

39:29.467 --> 39:30.593
Just try, okay?

39:31.936 --> 39:32.925
Turn off the light.

39:51.655 --> 39:53.020
David!

39:54.258 --> 39:56.488
They're out there, at the window.

39:56.694 --> 39:57.991
I've got a gun. Get away...

39:58.195 --> 40:01.426
...or I swear to God,
I'm gonna fucking use it.

40:12.276 --> 40:14.767
Oh, God, leave us alone.

40:37.501 --> 40:38.900
I don't see anybody.

40:40.104 --> 40:42.572
- Well, they wouldn't just leave.
- No, they wouldn't.

40:47.645 --> 40:49.237
David, don't. They were in there.

40:54.452 --> 40:57.148
Okay. If they wanna come in here,
they're gonna come in.

40:57.354 --> 41:00.517
It doesn't matter. We gotta find
another way out of here right now.

41:03.794 --> 41:04.988
Fuck.

41:12.136 --> 41:15.071
- I need to get to that phone.
- No, you're not going out there.

41:15.272 --> 41:17.672
Listen, Amy. It's a real phone, okay?
It will help.

41:17.875 --> 41:20.503
They're not gonna let you get to it.
Don't go out there.

41:20.711 --> 41:23.942
Look, look. If we stay here...

41:24.148 --> 41:26.309
...we're gonna wind up
like all of them.

41:28.085 --> 41:29.450
Please.

41:30.654 --> 41:33.851
Now, we know that they were outside,
watching that window.

41:34.058 --> 41:38.154
If we can keep their attention on that,
it'll give me time to get to the phone.

41:38.362 --> 41:40.455
Well, how can we do that?

42:24.475 --> 42:25.772
Fuck.

42:29.947 --> 42:31.574
Please hurry.

42:44.028 --> 42:46.223
Come on, come on.

42:49.600 --> 42:51.227
- <i>911 Emergency.</i>
- Yeah, hello.

42:51.435 --> 42:53.733
We need help.
Some people are trying to kill us.

42:53.938 --> 42:55.303
<i>Where are you located, sir?</i>

42:55.506 --> 42:58.339
Me and my wife are at this motel.
The Pinewood Motel.

42:58.542 --> 43:01.511
It's near the mountains.
They've got us trapped.

43:01.712 --> 43:03.373
<i>Who has you trapped, sir?</i>

43:03.581 --> 43:07.574
I don't know. We just need help.
The Pinewood Motel.

43:07.785 --> 43:10.015
<i>Yes, sir. Do you have an address?</i>

43:10.220 --> 43:13.348
No, I don't. It's near some side road.
Jesus Christ, look it up.

43:13.557 --> 43:15.491
<i>You're going to need to settle down,</i>
<i>sir.</i>

43:15.693 --> 43:18.992
<i>You'll never survive</i>
<i>if you lose control, Mr. Fox.</i>

43:20.931 --> 43:24.059
<i>And you shouldn't be wandering</i>
<i>around in the dark by yourself.</i>

43:50.894 --> 43:53.692
- Did you get anyone on the phone?
- No.

44:00.604 --> 44:03.801
- Why the fuck are they doing this?
- Listen.

44:04.842 --> 44:07.367
It's getting light.
They're gonna want this over soon.

44:07.578 --> 44:10.445
We need something.
What about the knife from your apple?

44:10.648 --> 44:12.047
It's in the car.

44:22.459 --> 44:24.324
Nothing in here.

44:40.177 --> 44:41.576
This will have to do.

44:42.880 --> 44:44.507
You're bleeding.

44:58.595 --> 45:00.586
What do you think they're doing?

45:02.633 --> 45:05.693
I think they're enjoying themselves.

45:54.618 --> 45:55.983
You let me fall asleep.

45:56.420 --> 45:59.753
- It was just because of your pills.
- I have to be awake.

45:59.957 --> 46:02.790
No. Honey, I need you to stay there.

46:03.627 --> 46:06.721
- What?
- They're watching you.

46:06.930 --> 46:08.056
And they're listening.

46:09.032 --> 46:12.729
I didn't want them to watch what I was
doing, but they need to see you.

46:12.936 --> 46:15.837
So they don't think
we're trying to get out.

46:16.039 --> 46:17.301
Okay?

46:19.510 --> 46:22.479
- Wait, what are you doing?
- Going through the tapes.

46:22.679 --> 46:25.978
They have cameras everywhere,
even outside. They edit them together.

46:26.183 --> 46:30.176
Remember the screaming from the TV
the guy was watching in the office?

46:30.387 --> 46:31.854
I'm sure it was one of these.

46:33.290 --> 46:36.748
It's not enough they rob and kill
these people, they wanna watch it too.

46:36.960 --> 46:38.689
Why are you watching them?

46:39.997 --> 46:41.294
I'm looking for mistakes.

46:43.333 --> 46:46.302
These people, they weren't smart.

46:46.937 --> 46:49.872
They thought the room
would protect them and it won't.

46:50.073 --> 46:52.132
They can come in
anytime they want.

46:53.043 --> 46:55.170
They just watch until they get bored.

46:55.813 --> 46:57.542
See? Right there.

46:57.748 --> 46:59.909
It happens
in almost every one of these.

47:01.285 --> 47:02.479
He just shows up.

47:04.154 --> 47:06.952
Well, how'd he get inside?
He wasn't in here before.

47:08.425 --> 47:09.949
He didn't come through the door.

47:10.561 --> 47:14.463
I can't tell from the others,
but with this angle...

47:15.833 --> 47:17.460
...right there.

47:19.002 --> 47:20.299
It's the bathroom.

47:21.605 --> 47:24.733
And that's where your apple
came from.

47:26.710 --> 47:28.405
Just stay here.

49:05.642 --> 49:06.609
David.

49:07.210 --> 49:10.702
I saw lights. Someone's here.

49:18.956 --> 49:20.423
- Come on.
- Wait.

49:20.624 --> 49:22.251
We don't know who he is.

49:22.459 --> 49:24.586
He's a ride out of this place.

49:24.795 --> 49:28.356
Yeah, unless he's one of them.
What the fuck's he doing here so late?

49:31.401 --> 49:35.098
Maybe he's lost. That could happen.

49:35.305 --> 49:38.832
He looks like he's been driving
a long time. He's not one of them.

49:39.910 --> 49:41.605
He could help us. Come on.

49:41.812 --> 49:44.303
Wait. You can't go out there.

49:46.550 --> 49:47.642
Help!

49:49.720 --> 49:52.052
- Over here, sir!
- Help!

49:52.756 --> 49:54.986
Hey, come here!

50:12.776 --> 50:14.573
- He's coming.
- No, they won't let him.

50:14.778 --> 50:18.145
He needs to get in the truck.
The truck. I'm gonna tell him.

50:20.784 --> 50:22.718
- David.
- What?

50:23.253 --> 50:24.845
- Fuck, no.
- No!

50:27.157 --> 50:29.591
Turn around. Turn around!

50:32.029 --> 50:35.396
Turn around. They're behind you!

50:35.899 --> 50:37.867
Turn around!

50:39.002 --> 50:40.128
Hey!

50:42.105 --> 50:44.403
- Wasn't sure you were gonna make it.
- You got them?

50:44.608 --> 50:45.700
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

50:47.244 --> 50:49.178
That's the good stuff.

50:50.213 --> 50:53.842
- Oh, my God.
- Okay, come on. Come on.

50:56.987 --> 50:58.716
- Okay, go.
- What's in there?

50:58.922 --> 51:00.480
Go. Come on.

51:15.605 --> 51:18.665
We can't go in that.
We don't know what's in there.

51:18.875 --> 51:22.402
We don't have any choice.
Amy, we have to do this, okay?

51:22.612 --> 51:24.842
Come on.

51:25.048 --> 51:27.448
Just follow me.
I'll lead us out of here.

51:28.585 --> 51:32.612
It's gonna be okay.
This is gonna lead us out of here.

52:21.004 --> 52:24.997
- I can't. I have to go back.
- We can't, they're gonna be waiting.

52:25.675 --> 52:28.644
- I can't breathe.
- Yes, you can, all right?

52:28.845 --> 52:32.110
Just close your eyes, grab hold
of my leg. I'm gonna lead us.

52:32.315 --> 52:34.010
It's not much further.

52:34.217 --> 52:35.946
Come on.

52:38.488 --> 52:40.149
It's okay.

52:42.559 --> 52:47.428
- David, please. It's gonna fall.
- No, it's not. Come on. Come on.

52:51.168 --> 52:53.864
Shit. Oh, fuck.

52:54.204 --> 52:56.172
What? What's the matter?

52:56.373 --> 52:58.967
- You can't scream, Amy.
- What?

52:59.176 --> 53:00.973
They're gonna hear you
if you scream.

53:01.178 --> 53:03.874
Okay? Just keep moving.
We're almost there.

53:06.016 --> 53:07.347
What's that?

53:07.551 --> 53:08.848
Oh, God.

53:13.823 --> 53:15.723
Oh, God.

53:15.926 --> 53:17.689
Shit.

53:32.509 --> 53:33.874
I see something.

53:34.077 --> 53:36.307
- What is it?
- Door, maybe.

53:48.658 --> 53:50.455
Where are we?

53:56.733 --> 53:58.758
<i>This is what you get.</i>

54:00.003 --> 54:01.300
Where are we?

54:10.947 --> 54:13.677
<i>We haven't done anything to you.</i>

54:14.884 --> 54:18.547
<i>Please, you could be my son.</i>
<i>You could be my son. Please.</i>

54:24.094 --> 54:27.825
<i>Please, please, don't do it.</i>
<i>Please, don't. You can't.</i>

54:29.599 --> 54:31.362
<i>Who are you guys?</i>

54:34.304 --> 54:36.568
<i>You can have anything. Anything.</i>

54:39.109 --> 54:41.771
<i>Please, don't kill me.</i>

54:46.850 --> 54:48.545
Help me.

54:49.686 --> 54:51.347
<i>Please don't. I'm begging you.</i>

54:52.322 --> 54:53.812
<i>You can have money.</i>

54:54.024 --> 54:55.821
Let me get the door.

55:04.000 --> 55:07.561
<i>Please, no. Please!</i>

55:28.491 --> 55:30.391
Oh, God.

55:35.932 --> 55:37.490
We're no better off than we were.

55:37.701 --> 55:39.760
No, look, we're still alive.

55:39.969 --> 55:43.029
Okay, there has to be something
in here we can use.

56:01.391 --> 56:04.053
- <i>911 Emergency.</i>
- Yeah, they're trying to kill us.

56:04.260 --> 56:07.024
<i>I need your name and location.</i>

56:21.077 --> 56:22.567
Okay.

56:24.381 --> 56:27.043
- Well, they're out there somewhere.
- <i>Ma'am?</i>

56:27.250 --> 56:30.549
<i>Hello? I need your name</i>
<i>and location, ma'am.</i>

56:31.020 --> 56:32.487
<i>Ma'am?</i>

56:33.390 --> 56:35.119
- <i>Hello?</i>
- Fuck!

56:35.792 --> 56:37.521
Fuck! Fuck!

56:45.602 --> 56:47.035
Get down there after them.

56:54.711 --> 56:56.406
Bitch!

57:09.459 --> 57:11.450
They're under us!

58:57.200 --> 58:58.758
They'll find us in here.

58:58.968 --> 59:01.436
Well, we can't try to run. Not yet.

59:01.638 --> 59:04.607
We have to let them think
we got away, let them go after us.

59:04.807 --> 59:06.274
Then we can try to run.

59:06.476 --> 59:09.570
- What if they look in here first?
- Jesus, Amy. I don't know.

59:09.779 --> 59:12.612
I'm doing the best I can over here.

59:24.661 --> 59:27.095
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

59:28.531 --> 59:31.557
- No, I'm sorry.
- No, there's nothing to be sorry for.

59:31.768 --> 59:34.794
- I'm the one that got off the interstate.
- No, I... .

59:35.872 --> 59:38.272
I mean for everything else.

59:38.808 --> 59:40.139
I'm sorry about us.

59:41.945 --> 59:43.708
And about Charlie.

59:44.681 --> 59:46.376
I should've made sure
the gate was up.

59:46.583 --> 59:48.483
I shouldn't have let him
near the stairs.

59:48.685 --> 59:51.051
It's not your fault, okay?
None of it was.

59:51.254 --> 59:52.721
It was an accident.

59:54.424 --> 59:59.020
Please. You have to stop
blaming yourself, all right?

59:59.228 --> 01:00:01.059
No one else does.

01:00:01.264 --> 01:00:03.459
It's okay. It's okay.

01:00:10.340 --> 01:00:11.898
Listen.

01:00:12.108 --> 01:00:14.008
We just have to make it out of this.

01:00:15.011 --> 01:00:16.501
All right?

01:00:17.814 --> 01:00:21.079
Everything starts over
once we make it out of this.

01:00:22.285 --> 01:00:23.809
All right?

01:00:24.020 --> 01:00:25.544
Promise.

01:00:38.401 --> 01:00:40.369
- It's the 911.
- Hold on. Hold on.

01:00:40.570 --> 01:00:43.334
It could be one of them,
like the truck driver.

01:00:44.007 --> 01:00:47.443
When you called 911,
you didn't tell them where we were.

01:00:47.644 --> 01:00:49.839
Why would they be here now?

01:00:50.046 --> 01:00:52.207
Well, maybe they traced the call.

01:00:53.916 --> 01:00:57.215
Gosh. You sure it came from here?
It's just me tonight.

01:00:57.420 --> 01:01:00.048
- And you run the place?
- Oh, yeah.

01:01:00.256 --> 01:01:02.986
Then I won't disturb anybody
if I take a look around?

01:01:03.192 --> 01:01:04.659
No.

01:01:05.461 --> 01:01:07.326
No, no.

01:01:07.930 --> 01:01:10.455
Haven't had a guest here
in three nights.

01:01:17.840 --> 01:01:19.000
Slow season, huh?

01:01:19.208 --> 01:01:22.609
Yeah, well, all four of them.

01:01:30.953 --> 01:01:32.580
That happen tonight?

01:01:34.557 --> 01:01:36.616
These goddamn kids.

01:01:36.826 --> 01:01:40.421
Come around and vandalize stuff.

01:01:41.097 --> 01:01:43.531
I just haven't gotten around
to cleaning that up.

01:01:44.167 --> 01:01:47.364
- Been too busy with all the guests.
- That's right.

01:01:50.039 --> 01:01:52.701
I probably should
look in these rooms.

01:02:03.820 --> 01:02:04.980
Wrong keys.

01:02:05.188 --> 01:02:07.816
Let me head back to the office.
I'll be right back.

01:02:22.638 --> 01:02:25.539
- They're looking for us.
- Maybe he's here to help us.

01:02:25.742 --> 01:02:29.109
No. He isn't. He wouldn't just
let him walk around like that.

01:03:07.116 --> 01:03:08.743
Hello?

01:03:30.339 --> 01:03:32.500
When I called 911...

01:03:32.708 --> 01:03:35.575
...it was the guy from the office
that answered the phone.

01:04:32.668 --> 01:04:34.499
He looks scared.

01:04:35.137 --> 01:04:36.832
I think he has one of the tapes.

01:04:40.209 --> 01:04:41.369
He's gonna leave, David.

01:04:45.815 --> 01:04:47.680
He's leaving.

01:04:51.287 --> 01:04:52.515
Help us!

01:04:53.789 --> 01:04:55.086
No, wait, wait, wait.

01:04:57.994 --> 01:04:59.894
Get in the car.

01:05:04.333 --> 01:05:05.595
- Go.
- How many are there?

01:05:05.801 --> 01:05:07.428
Three, I think. Come on, let's go.

01:05:07.637 --> 01:05:09.104
What's the matter?

01:05:10.673 --> 01:05:12.732
They're trying to make sure
we can't leave.

01:05:12.942 --> 01:05:15.934
Well, I'm not gonna give them
a choice. Stay here.

01:05:29.992 --> 01:05:31.220
Shit.

01:05:39.669 --> 01:05:41.432
Get out.

01:05:42.972 --> 01:05:45.736
Had to drag him into this,
didn't you?

01:05:46.375 --> 01:05:49.902
You might as well have stuck
that knife into his back yourself.

01:05:52.748 --> 01:05:55.342
Oh, my God, they killed him.
David, they killed him.

01:06:41.030 --> 01:06:43.123
David, we're not gonna
fit through there.

01:06:52.441 --> 01:06:54.602
Okay, they're going
around the other side.

01:06:54.810 --> 01:06:57.779
If I can get in the office,
they keep some guns there.

01:07:18.801 --> 01:07:20.996
- Okay, this is gonna work.
- What?

01:07:21.203 --> 01:07:24.036
We'll leave them a trail.
Watch out.

01:07:26.409 --> 01:07:27.774
Come on.

01:07:29.712 --> 01:07:32.203
They'll think you made it out.
They won't look up here.

01:07:32.415 --> 01:07:33.939
Come on, get up here.

01:07:35.718 --> 01:07:37.686
Give me your foot.

01:07:37.887 --> 01:07:39.354
Just get up there. You got it?

01:07:40.956 --> 01:07:42.583
Okay. Go right over there.

01:07:42.792 --> 01:07:44.020
Okay. Stay still.

01:07:45.061 --> 01:07:46.221
What about you?

01:07:46.429 --> 01:07:48.397
Go to the office
and get that guy's gun.

01:07:48.597 --> 01:07:50.121
No, don't leave me here. Please.

01:07:50.332 --> 01:07:54.359
I have to. It's only for a second.
All right? I swear to you.

01:07:55.471 --> 01:07:57.029
Please, I don't wanna do this.

01:07:57.239 --> 01:08:00.333
No. We have to.
This is our only shot.

01:08:00.543 --> 01:08:03.774
You just gotta be really quiet.
You don't make a sound.

01:08:03.979 --> 01:08:05.139
Whatever happens...

01:08:06.382 --> 01:08:10.113
...just don't make a sound. All right?

01:08:11.320 --> 01:08:12.810
We're gonna make it out of this.

01:08:13.022 --> 01:08:14.751
Promise?

01:08:15.958 --> 01:08:18.256
I promise. Now shut that.

01:08:26.502 --> 01:08:27.594
Amy...

01:08:30.305 --> 01:08:31.773
...I love you.

01:09:20.589 --> 01:09:22.216
Oh, my God--

01:09:55.824 --> 01:09:58.418
Come on, come on. Come on.

01:10:12.875 --> 01:10:15.343
All right, get her out here.
Let's do this thing.

01:10:40.536 --> 01:10:42.367
Go find her.

01:14:33.368 --> 01:14:35.029
What the fuck?

01:14:39.975 --> 01:14:41.602
God! God!

01:16:18.840 --> 01:16:22.571
God. Fucking-- God. Fucking bitch.

01:16:22.778 --> 01:16:25.008
Fucking, fucking bitch.

01:16:25.213 --> 01:16:26.475
Fuck!

01:16:32.721 --> 01:16:34.086
You fucking--

01:16:34.957 --> 01:16:37.050
Be still now. Be still.

01:16:43.599 --> 01:16:45.499
Bitch.

01:16:46.268 --> 01:16:48.168
Fuck!

01:16:51.974 --> 01:16:53.805
You fucking bitch. Come on.

01:16:56.578 --> 01:16:59.172
Get up there. Get up there, I said.

01:17:00.749 --> 01:17:04.116
Get your head up. Think you
were gonna walk out of here, huh?

01:17:04.319 --> 01:17:06.116
Fucking bitch. Put your head up.

01:17:06.955 --> 01:17:10.516
Look. Should've killed you last night.
That's what I should've done.

01:17:10.726 --> 01:17:13.889
I could've killed you last night.
I should've killed you last night.

01:17:14.096 --> 01:17:16.087
Now shut the fuck up
and get your face up.

01:17:16.298 --> 01:17:19.699
Get your face up. Hey. Hey. Hey.

01:17:20.769 --> 01:17:24.034
You think you can fuck with this?
You think you can fuck with me?

01:17:24.239 --> 01:17:26.503
Hey. Look at me. Look in my eyes.

01:17:26.708 --> 01:17:30.439
Look at me. Look at me.
Look at me. Hey, look at me!

01:17:30.646 --> 01:17:31.943
Fuck you!

01:17:37.886 --> 01:17:39.615
Fucking bitch.

01:18:54.996 --> 01:18:56.395
David.

01:18:57.866 --> 01:18:59.663
Can you hear me?

01:19:02.704 --> 01:19:04.729
I'm gonna get help.

01:19:51.820 --> 01:19:53.082
<i>911 Emergency.</i>

01:19:53.288 --> 01:19:55.848
Please, we need your help.
My husband, he's--

01:19:56.057 --> 01:19:59.117
- <i>What's your name and location?</i>
- Amy Fox, at the Pinewood Motel.

01:19:59.327 --> 01:20:02.125
I don't know the address,
but, please, you have to hurry.

01:20:02.330 --> 01:20:04.457
<i>An officer already responded</i>
<i>to that location.</i>

01:20:04.666 --> 01:20:07.931
And they killed him.
Please, you can't let my husband die.

01:20:08.136 --> 01:20:10.195
<i>Okay, someone's on their way.</i>
