WEBVTT

00:11.236 --> 00:13.403
You got some crazy going on here.

00:13.404 --> 00:16.739
I heard a man say,
I'm going to kill you.

00:16.740 --> 00:18.975
Scared. A lot of fear.

00:18.976 --> 00:20.277
I see a shadow.

00:20.278 --> 00:23.077
I see a man go down the hallway.

00:23.078 --> 00:26.146
Jumping all over the room.

00:26.147 --> 00:28.749
Someone took a hot curling
iron to the back of my neck.

00:28.750 --> 00:30.682
Sounds like you have a serious problem.

00:30.683 --> 00:33.449
I just got grabbed.

00:33.450 --> 00:36.690
Somebody died back here.

00:37.301 --> 00:38.894
It's really bad in here.

00:38.895 --> 00:41.926
My name is Amy Allan.

00:41.927 --> 00:43.673
Something is not right.

00:43.674 --> 00:44.960
I see dead people.

00:44.961 --> 00:47.115
This person might have
been a serial killer.

00:47.116 --> 00:49.149
I speak to dead people.

00:49.150 --> 00:50.683
You get those chills.

00:50.684 --> 00:52.352
And they speak to me.

00:52.353 --> 00:54.620
He is darkness. He is evil.

00:54.621 --> 00:57.622
But there's only one way to
know if my findings are real.

00:57.623 --> 00:59.491
I think she broke her neck.

00:59.492 --> 01:01.046
I rely on my partner.

01:01.047 --> 01:04.794
I'm Steve Di Schiavi. I'm a retired
New York City homicide Detective.

01:04.795 --> 01:06.462
You telling me the truth?

01:06.463 --> 01:09.548
And I know every person,
every house has secrets.

01:09.549 --> 01:11.233
I think the Devil is down here.

01:11.234 --> 01:12.702
It's my job to reveal them.

01:12.703 --> 01:14.330
Who the hell would do this?

01:14.331 --> 01:16.323
But Steve and I never speak...

01:16.324 --> 01:18.476
We never communicate
during an investigation.

01:18.477 --> 01:20.046
Until the very end.

01:20.047 --> 01:21.193
Who's he looking to kill?

01:21.194 --> 01:23.295
We uncover if it's
safe for you to stay...

01:23.296 --> 01:25.373
You need to get out of here right now.

01:25.374 --> 01:26.612
Or time to get out.

01:26.613 --> 01:30.213
It was like endless darkness.

01:32.000 --> 01:38.074

01:47.506 --> 01:50.744
Amy and I look into
each case separately.

01:50.745 --> 01:53.155
I interview living
witnesses and uncover dark

01:53.156 --> 01:56.820
history that's been
buried and forgotten.

01:56.821 --> 02:00.715
While Amy communicates with the dead.

02:00.716 --> 02:02.963
I've just arrived in St.
Clair Shores, Michigan.

02:02.964 --> 02:05.849
It's about a half-hour
outside of Detroit.

02:05.850 --> 02:10.186
I received a call from a mom named Emily,
and she sounded pretty upset on the phone.

02:10.187 --> 02:14.228
Her husband and two sets of twins are
being tormented by paranormal activity.

02:14.229 --> 02:20.129
She says it's ripping the whole
family apart, and we're her last hope.

02:26.389 --> 02:30.231
Before Amy arrives, I do a
complete sweep of the house.

02:30.232 --> 02:33.376
Things that are common in most
homes, like family photographs,

02:33.377 --> 02:36.797
can influence her findings.

02:36.923 --> 02:42.823
So it's important I remove them
all before she begins her walk.

03:01.849 --> 03:04.669
This is not good.

03:05.102 --> 03:07.022
What?

03:07.299 --> 03:10.393
There was, like, a man...

03:10.394 --> 03:13.994
Crawling out from under here.

03:17.874 --> 03:20.424
And he doesn't have any
arms or legs anymore.

03:20.425 --> 03:25.285
So he's, like, a black
slithery, snaky thing.

03:27.002 --> 03:29.559
He makes you feel...

03:29.560 --> 03:31.480
Fear.

03:44.854 --> 03:46.873
So, Emily, when we spoke
on the phone, you sounded

03:46.874 --> 03:49.081
pretty upset about the things
that are happening here.

03:49.082 --> 03:50.738
- Yes.
- Tell me what's going on.

03:50.739 --> 03:53.716
We hear voices, footsteps.

03:53.717 --> 03:57.557
We see shadows move, apparitions.

03:58.490 --> 04:01.154
Okay. How many people
actually live in the house?

04:01.155 --> 04:05.607
My husband, my 12-year-old
twins, my 7-year-old twins.

04:05.608 --> 04:06.993
And we have two dogs.

04:06.994 --> 04:09.079
Okay. How long are you living here?

04:09.080 --> 04:12.177
- Seven and a half years.
- Why did you call us now?

04:12.178 --> 04:14.671
In the last year, it's gotten physical.

04:14.672 --> 04:17.334
- Really?
- Mm hmm. I've been scratched.

04:17.336 --> 04:20.241
I have severe nausea every day.

04:20.242 --> 04:26.142
And my youngest son has also
been showing symptoms of nausea.

04:26.852 --> 04:30.439
Feeling sick to your stomach is
hardly proof of something paranormal.

04:30.440 --> 04:33.536
But it's not my job to speculate
about that side of the case.

04:33.537 --> 04:34.871
I leave that up to Amy.

04:34.872 --> 04:37.040
Have you and him gone to a doctor?

04:37.041 --> 04:41.488
Yes. But no one can
explain why it's happening.

04:41.489 --> 04:44.614
Well, that's got to be tearing you and
your husband apart a little bit, right?

04:44.615 --> 04:47.925
It is. Me and my husband
don't sleep together anymore.

04:47.926 --> 04:49.670
I sleep up here on the couch.

04:49.671 --> 04:51.126
Why?

04:51.127 --> 04:53.621
To stay closer to my children.

04:53.622 --> 04:56.467
I couldn't leave them up
here by themselves anymore.

04:56.468 --> 04:59.947
I'm very worried that
they're going to be hurt.

04:59.948 --> 05:01.868
Okay.

05:08.656 --> 05:12.616
You got some crazy going on here.

05:14.190 --> 05:16.029
And now I feel really sick.

05:16.030 --> 05:18.431
I don't feel good at all.

05:18.432 --> 05:20.088
What's going on?

05:20.089 --> 05:23.209
It's a stomach thing.

05:28.892 --> 05:32.543
[Bleep] I don't feel good in this place.

05:32.544 --> 05:34.644
At all.

05:35.353 --> 05:37.265
Phew.

05:37.266 --> 05:39.941
- Like, mm.
- Just, your stomach in general?

05:39.942 --> 05:42.703
It's like stomach and heart.

05:42.704 --> 05:45.884
Terrible. Terrible pain.

05:46.527 --> 05:48.327
Mm.

05:56.407 --> 05:58.455
Okay, so, what's going on in this room?

05:58.456 --> 06:01.080
I hear voices all night.

06:01.081 --> 06:06.372
One night, I heard a man
say, I'm going to kill you.

06:06.373 --> 06:10.314
- That had to scare the hell out of you.
- Mm hmm.

06:10.315 --> 06:15.672
My daughter Katey came running out
of her room the other day, screaming.

06:15.673 --> 06:17.423
Um, completely naked.

06:17.424 --> 06:20.641
And she said a man whistled and...

06:20.642 --> 06:23.330
Breathed heavy in her ear.

06:23.331 --> 06:26.664
- It was heartbreaking.
- Wow. Anything else?

06:26.665 --> 06:29.734
I see an apparition of an older man.

06:29.735 --> 06:33.142
I would say he's probably in his 70s.

06:33.143 --> 06:35.505
He wears a hat.

06:35.506 --> 06:38.043
- It does have a brim on it.
- Okay.

06:38.044 --> 06:40.576
Now, besides that guy,
have you seen anything else?

06:40.577 --> 06:44.742
The first night that we
moved in, I saw a uh...

06:44.743 --> 06:48.403
Huge, big, cloudy, black mass.

06:48.629 --> 06:50.955
Hanging right over here.

06:50.956 --> 06:52.608
I screamed.

06:52.609 --> 06:55.541
And that's when it went away.

06:55.542 --> 06:57.294
How often have you seen that?

06:57.295 --> 07:02.252
It happened for seven straight
days the first week we moved in.

07:02.253 --> 07:04.173
Okay.

07:07.304 --> 07:11.642
I'm seeing this one guy
from outside under the car.

07:11.643 --> 07:14.343
He's everywhere.

07:17.298 --> 07:20.695
Plus, you've got some
weird [Bleep] on the wall.

07:20.696 --> 07:24.281
- What do you mean?
- It's like, um, lines.

07:24.282 --> 07:27.642
Squiggly lines, like this.

07:29.425 --> 07:32.354
- That's what's on the wall?
- Yeah.

07:32.355 --> 07:38.255
They're, like, more of an emotional
kind of a thing. Like an unsettled...

07:38.598 --> 07:40.698
Feeling.

07:42.709 --> 07:47.168
It might be coming from
someone who is still alive.

07:47.169 --> 07:50.946
Sometimes when the living
experience intense negative emotions,

07:50.947 --> 07:55.864
their energy can manifest things
like these bizarre lines on the walls.

07:55.865 --> 08:00.507
And they have the ability to
affect the living in harmful ways.

08:00.508 --> 08:06.268
It kind of gives me a headache
and makes me feel chaotic.

08:06.372 --> 08:09.972
Whatever it is, is not good.

08:17.826 --> 08:19.757
Okay, so, what's going on down here?

08:19.758 --> 08:23.416
I've had my hair pulled from the back...

08:23.417 --> 08:25.223
Very violently.

08:25.224 --> 08:27.147
And there wasn't the
kids around or anything

08:27.148 --> 08:28.977
like that that could've
possibly done that?

08:28.978 --> 08:32.283
Nobody was down here. I was alone.

08:32.284 --> 08:34.217
It sounds like you have
a serious problem here.

08:34.219 --> 08:36.784
It's actually even worse than that.

08:36.784 --> 08:39.544
I've been burnt.

08:40.149 --> 08:43.895
It was like someone took a hot
curling iron to the back of my neck.

08:43.895 --> 08:45.676
It happened four times.

08:45.677 --> 08:49.697
Every time, I was taking a shower.

08:56.358 --> 08:58.218
Wow.

08:59.030 --> 09:01.544
You sure it wasn't
maybe the heat changing?

09:01.545 --> 09:04.425
Absolutely positive.

09:05.701 --> 09:07.333
Geez.

09:07.334 --> 09:10.552
Now, what if Amy says this is only
going to get worse and you can't fix it?

09:10.553 --> 09:11.533
What would you do?

09:11.534 --> 09:15.217
I'm going to take my kids
and walk out that door.

09:15.218 --> 09:17.138
Okay.

09:20.582 --> 09:23.833
I just felt like
somebody touched my hair.

09:23.834 --> 09:26.517
Like, there has been some
physical [Bleep] here.

09:26.518 --> 09:29.294
Ah. I just got grabbed.

09:29.295 --> 09:32.603
Like, behind my... right here.

09:32.604 --> 09:34.382
Like that.

09:34.383 --> 09:35.799
Okay.

09:35.800 --> 09:40.752
And he said, basically,
get out of here [Bleep]!

09:40.753 --> 09:42.460
Shut up.

09:42.461 --> 09:46.971
And one would think
that it's a dead male.

09:46.972 --> 09:51.892
But it is a fully-formed
uh, PK manifestation.

09:53.064 --> 09:58.190
A PK manifestation usually happens when a
living person's energy creates an entity.

09:58.191 --> 10:04.091
These manifestations are very powerful and
can physically influence their environment.

10:04.814 --> 10:07.801
How advanced would you say it is?

10:07.802 --> 10:13.382
Well, it's definitely capable
of causing physical injury.

10:37.398 --> 10:39.303
Erich, I spoke to Emily.

10:39.304 --> 10:41.905
Um, she told me about all the
stuff that's happening here.

10:41.906 --> 10:43.973
What have you been experiencing?

10:43.974 --> 10:46.786
I came down to take a nap one afternoon.

10:46.787 --> 10:50.443
And I thought it was Katey and Erich
that came down and actually were...

10:50.444 --> 10:53.082
Bouncing on the bed
and talking and whatnot.

10:53.083 --> 10:54.923
- So you were sleeping on the bed.
- Correct.

10:54.924 --> 10:56.733
And what, did you feel
like this, how did it?

10:56.734 --> 10:58.359
Yeah, pretty much.

10:58.360 --> 11:01.524
Kind of felt like two
kids jumping on a bed.

11:01.525 --> 11:02.314
Okay.

11:02.315 --> 11:05.228
But when I went to
look, they weren't there.

11:05.229 --> 11:06.616
Have you seen anything?

11:06.617 --> 11:09.602
Oh, I see apparitions
down here frequently.

11:09.603 --> 11:12.206
- Frequently.
- Describe the apparitions for me.

11:12.207 --> 11:13.707
There's a guy.

11:13.708 --> 11:18.693
And he will walk behind me
and come into this bedroom.

11:18.694 --> 11:21.083
It's pretty unnerving.

11:21.084 --> 11:23.209
It's got to be tough on your family.

11:23.210 --> 11:28.006
Sometimes, you got your kids and
they look at you and they wonder um...

11:28.007 --> 11:29.916
Why did you do this to me?

11:29.917 --> 11:35.817
- Well, that's got to break your heart.
- Oh, it hurts. It hurts.

11:43.852 --> 11:45.802
There's just problems within the family.

11:45.803 --> 11:51.241
And unfortunately, this family has
some emotional instability there.

11:51.242 --> 11:55.802
There's definitely a
poltergeist going on.

11:55.957 --> 11:59.497
Um, there might be a few...

11:59.544 --> 12:01.764
Happening.

12:02.177 --> 12:05.244
Do you know if they're aware
that they're doing this?

12:05.245 --> 12:08.222
No. No, I don't think so.

12:08.223 --> 12:12.981
You also have kids who
are... have abilities.

12:12.982 --> 12:18.211
And they happen to be able
to create PK manifestations.

12:18.212 --> 12:23.852
And there's so much energy,
it literally makes you sick.

12:34.373 --> 12:36.383
So, I was talking to mom.

12:36.384 --> 12:38.050
And your mom said
that you guys have been

12:38.051 --> 12:40.844
having some strange
experiences in the house.

12:40.845 --> 12:42.394
- Is that right?
- Yes.

12:42.395 --> 12:45.986
Okay, so, Erich, why don't you
tell me what you've been seeing?

12:45.987 --> 12:49.774
Sometimes, I see a
shadow in the hallway.

12:49.775 --> 12:51.689
Okay. What kind of shadow
are we talking about?

12:51.690 --> 12:53.165
Like, a man.

12:53.166 --> 12:55.724
Was anybody walking around
that they made that shadow?

12:55.725 --> 12:57.476
Or was it something,
I don't know, where...

12:57.477 --> 12:59.286
- No one was there.
- Nobody was there.

12:59.287 --> 13:01.082
- No.
- Okay. What about you, Sweetie?

13:01.083 --> 13:06.169
When I go to bed, I always
see a man go down the hallway.

13:06.170 --> 13:08.486
Is it the same like he sees it?

13:08.487 --> 13:10.769
Okay. What else have you experienced?

13:10.770 --> 13:14.069
Well, we both seen a girl.

13:14.070 --> 13:16.194
- A little girl?
- Yes.

13:16.195 --> 13:18.786
Okay. Do you know how she's dressed?

13:18.787 --> 13:21.622
Sometimes, she has a big white dress on.

13:21.623 --> 13:24.653
And it sleeps with me sometimes.

13:24.654 --> 13:28.439
She just sleeps at the end of
there, and my head's back there.

13:28.440 --> 13:31.038
- Okay. Does that scare you?
- Mm.

13:31.039 --> 13:33.748
So, you've had a lot of things
happening in your room here.

13:33.749 --> 13:36.419
Do you have trouble going to
bed at night because of that?

13:36.420 --> 13:38.296
- Sometimes.
- Sometimes.

13:38.297 --> 13:40.397
Me too.

13:46.480 --> 13:51.220
There's a lot of
emotional instability here.

13:51.668 --> 13:52.797
And people are...

13:52.798 --> 13:55.558
And people are...

13:57.637 --> 14:00.293
Freaking out and...

14:00.294 --> 14:03.654
Crying and hiding under...

14:03.848 --> 14:06.788
Blankets and sheets.

14:07.114 --> 14:09.639
Like, how many people?
Can you talk about them?

14:09.640 --> 14:14.286
I would say there is four
people who are very freaked out.

14:14.287 --> 14:15.168
Okay.

14:15.169 --> 14:18.847
I'd say at least three of them have...

14:18.848 --> 14:21.044
- Some PK [Bleep] going on.
- Okay.

14:21.045 --> 14:25.965
I think it's really just
mainly a poltergeist.

14:34.349 --> 14:35.808
Chad, I was talking your mom.

14:35.809 --> 14:38.178
And she told me that she's
having trouble sleeping at night.

14:38.179 --> 14:38.998
Mm-hmm.

14:38.999 --> 14:40.900
Are you having any
problems sleeping at night?

14:40.901 --> 14:43.786
Sometimes, when I go to
bed, like, I hear voices.

14:43.787 --> 14:45.500
What kind of voices are you hearing?

14:45.501 --> 14:48.246
Like, "hey". And like coughs.

14:48.247 --> 14:49.262
What else are you seeing?

14:49.263 --> 14:52.723
One time, I came in
from playing basketball.

14:52.724 --> 14:55.250
And I was going to get
some water. I grabbed a cup.

14:55.251 --> 14:58.044
And, like, the faucet
just, like, turned on.

14:58.045 --> 15:01.194
- On its own?
- Mm hmm. Like, full-force on.

15:01.195 --> 15:03.423
So when that happened,
did that scare you at all?

15:03.424 --> 15:04.993
No, not really.

15:04.994 --> 15:08.219
Let me ask you a question. Does
anything in the house scare you?

15:08.220 --> 15:12.152
Um, usually, in the basement,
I see a shadow in my dad's room.

15:12.153 --> 15:14.484
Like, it's a tall man in a hat.

15:14.485 --> 15:15.294
Okay.

15:15.295 --> 15:18.568
And just, like, peeks around
the corner and just goes away.

15:18.569 --> 15:21.147
You act kind of cool about all
the stuff that's happening here.

15:21.148 --> 15:25.642
You don't seem to be, I don't think you're
dealing with it about it the right way.

15:25.643 --> 15:28.960
It's not normal for a 12-year-old not
to be able to go to sleep at night.

15:28.961 --> 15:31.903
It's okay to be afraid.

15:31.904 --> 15:36.155
It's okay to be upset or
scared about something.

15:36.156 --> 15:38.330
You all right?

15:38.331 --> 15:40.251
Okay.

15:46.071 --> 15:47.871
Mm.

15:48.006 --> 15:50.118
A lot of different emotions.

15:50.119 --> 15:54.735
Like, definitely wanting to
cry, though, is the biggest one.

15:54.736 --> 15:56.253
Where are they coming from?

15:56.254 --> 15:59.171
The kid that's in this room.

15:59.172 --> 16:01.975
The person in here hears voices.

16:01.976 --> 16:06.596
People talking in the
room from the walls.

16:10.584 --> 16:13.820
Causes, like, headaches.
It's, like, too much.

16:13.821 --> 16:15.468
What's causing headaches?

16:15.469 --> 16:20.029
The voices and the
noise and the buzzing.

16:22.262 --> 16:26.102
This room is like [Bleep] chaos.

16:39.896 --> 16:43.167
This room is like [Bleep] chaos.

16:43.168 --> 16:48.235
There's, like, nightmares
and screaming and crying.

16:48.236 --> 16:51.922
And then, there's
these, like, light rods.

16:51.923 --> 16:55.763
Like, jumping all over the room.

16:59.716 --> 17:01.959
And it's so much, it hurts. It hurts.

17:01.960 --> 17:06.220
It buzzes in your head. It's buzzing.

17:06.531 --> 17:09.358
The energy in this
room is very unstable.

17:09.358 --> 17:14.135
Whoever lives here has major abilities
but doesn't know how to control them.

17:14.136 --> 17:18.336
Definitely, like, PK energy, for sure.

17:18.976 --> 17:21.556
Just not good.

17:25.037 --> 17:27.182
I usually start my investigation by

17:27.183 --> 17:29.279
reaching out to the
property's former owners.

17:29.280 --> 17:32.113
Most times, it's a dead end.

17:32.114 --> 17:34.344
In this case, I found
a woman named Shannon.

17:34.345 --> 17:38.215
She says she's got some information
that will definitely help my case.

17:38.216 --> 17:44.116
She's agreed to meet me at the
house and tell me what happened.

17:47.794 --> 17:51.121
Shannon, let me ask you a question. When
was the last time you were in this house?

17:51.122 --> 17:53.338
I'm guessing the late '70s.

17:53.339 --> 17:55.712
- Okay. So you grew up here.
- Yes.

17:55.713 --> 18:00.461
During your time here did you ever
experience anything you couldn't explain?

18:00.462 --> 18:02.689
- No. Mm mm.
- Nothing?

18:02.690 --> 18:04.500
Now, you mentioned on
the phone that you had

18:04.501 --> 18:06.395
some information that
could help my case.

18:06.396 --> 18:09.784
Well, my grandfather passed
away here in the house.

18:09.785 --> 18:10.822
Ah, geez.

18:10.823 --> 18:13.119
Just of natural causes.

18:13.120 --> 18:15.996
Did anybody else die in
the house that you know of?

18:15.997 --> 18:21.277
Ah, yes. Actually, my other
grandfather's girlfriend.

18:21.421 --> 18:23.098
What year did this happen?

18:23.099 --> 18:24.939
1978.

18:24.940 --> 18:29.601
In fact, here's the article
out of the local paper.

18:29.602 --> 18:33.990
There was a coat rack next to
the stairway to the basement.

18:33.991 --> 18:35.032
Okay.

18:35.033 --> 18:37.253
And um...

18:38.574 --> 18:42.336
Georgina went towards the coat rack and

18:42.337 --> 18:46.116
probably didn't realize the
stairway was beneath her feet.

18:46.117 --> 18:49.494
- Okay.
- So, she fell down the stairs and...

18:49.495 --> 18:52.795
Um, she tragically, um...

18:52.893 --> 18:55.772
Passed away that day.

18:55.773 --> 18:57.484
How'd your grandfather take that?

18:57.485 --> 19:02.045
It's the first time I ever seen him cry.

19:03.128 --> 19:07.328
I haven't thought about it in years.

19:09.476 --> 19:12.627
Somebody died back here.

19:12.628 --> 19:16.861
- What happened?
- It was just, like...

19:16.862 --> 19:19.682
It was very fast.

19:20.306 --> 19:24.506
Like, everybody involved with it is...

19:24.665 --> 19:27.545
Completely confused.

19:28.247 --> 19:30.167
Um...

19:30.551 --> 19:36.451
Scared. A lot of fear from these
people concerning this person.

19:37.075 --> 19:42.235
And it's, like, a sudden...
man, it's like, bam!

19:43.380 --> 19:45.715
I'm, like, very confused right now.

19:45.716 --> 19:48.296
Like... like...

19:49.157 --> 19:51.570
Here's the pain again. The pain again.

19:51.571 --> 19:54.295
- Like, the grabbing?
- Yes.

19:54.296 --> 19:57.356
Hurts so [Bleep] bad.

19:58.995 --> 20:00.813
I'm at the local library to see what

20:00.814 --> 20:04.688
else I can uncover about
my client's property.

20:04.689 --> 20:06.299
While digging through old deeds,

20:06.300 --> 20:11.120
I discovered that a man named Noah
Furton originally owned the land.

20:11.121 --> 20:17.021
But what catches my attention is a tragedy
involving two of his young children.

20:18.240 --> 20:20.151
So I've reached out to
one of his descendants,

20:20.152 --> 20:24.832
who says there's a
lot more to his story.

20:29.214 --> 20:32.568
So, Bev, it turns out that Noah
Furton actually owned the property that

20:32.569 --> 20:35.632
I'm investigating and lived there.
But you're a descendant of his.

20:35.633 --> 20:38.132
- How are you related?
- He was my great-grandfather.

20:38.133 --> 20:39.626
What can you tell me about him?

20:39.627 --> 20:43.585
Well, he was a sea Captain on
the Great Lakes for 35 years.

20:43.586 --> 20:47.306
I have a picture of his boat.

20:48.539 --> 20:52.780
Now, I saw in the census
that he lost two sons.

20:52.781 --> 20:54.664
Yes. He lost two children.

20:54.665 --> 20:56.813
One was two, and one was two months old.

20:56.814 --> 20:59.587
And they died within a week
of each other of measles.

20:59.588 --> 21:01.622
He also lost his wife.

21:01.623 --> 21:03.791
- What did she die of?
- Tuberculosis.

21:03.792 --> 21:05.835
- She was 49.
- So she was young.

21:05.836 --> 21:06.747
Yes.

21:06.748 --> 21:08.809
So, what ever wound
up happening with him?

21:08.810 --> 21:13.070
Well, when he was 78, he passed away.

21:14.461 --> 21:16.392
It sounds like he had
a pretty tough life.

21:16.393 --> 21:21.410
Yes, he did. But he also had a cousin,
Adolphus, who also lived on the property.

21:21.411 --> 21:23.145
And he had a very tough life.

21:23.146 --> 21:25.601
- You know anything about it?
- No, I don't know much.

21:25.602 --> 21:27.522
Okay.

21:29.357 --> 21:32.837
The men here have problems.

21:33.898 --> 21:35.753
You're talking about the dead?

21:35.754 --> 21:40.150
Yeah. Dead and living men
have problems in this location.

21:40.151 --> 21:44.531
Like, they don't act like their selves.

21:49.376 --> 21:53.166
So a normal guy moves in and then he...

21:53.167 --> 21:57.060
Gets involved with bad [Bleep] or...

21:57.061 --> 21:59.932
Drops dead or goes crazy.

21:59.933 --> 22:03.112
But it doesn't have anything
to do with the PK phenomena.

22:03.113 --> 22:06.305
Is this anything that
might be dangerous?

22:06.306 --> 22:08.226
Yeah.

22:21.903 --> 22:24.084
Bev mentioned that
Noah's cousin had an even

22:24.085 --> 22:26.486
worse time on the
property I'm investigating.

22:26.487 --> 22:28.873
So I'm headed over to
meet with a local archivist

22:28.874 --> 22:34.774
who tells me that the tragedy
this man suffered was unthinkable.

22:39.094 --> 22:42.240
Cindy, you mentioned that this guy,
Adolphus, had a pretty tragic life.

22:42.241 --> 22:45.349
But before we even get into that,
what can you tell me about him?

22:45.350 --> 22:50.160
Adolphus comes from a long line of
French-Canadians who settled in this area.

22:50.161 --> 22:51.402
Okay.

22:51.403 --> 22:56.567
And the Furton family did live on the
property that you are investigating.

22:56.568 --> 22:59.898
Okay. And then they settled
here to do what kind of work?

22:59.899 --> 23:03.353
He started out, as a
young man farming and,

23:03.354 --> 23:07.139
eventually went to the
occupation of sailing.

23:07.140 --> 23:12.412
Either for commercial vessels, small
boats, or the larger company boats.

23:12.413 --> 23:15.071
Okay. So they were considered,
like, merchant seamen at the time.

23:15.072 --> 23:18.956
I know that's dangerous work today.
So how bad was it for them back then?

23:18.957 --> 23:21.829
There were a lot of boiler explosions.

23:21.830 --> 23:26.307
There were a lot of groundings
of ships on the flats.

23:26.308 --> 23:29.428
It was very dangerous.

23:33.564 --> 23:36.444
This black, like...

23:37.234 --> 23:40.294
Slithery, snaky thing.

23:42.507 --> 23:46.606
I'm trying to figure out what
he looked like when he was alive.

23:46.607 --> 23:48.000
He's a big guy.

23:48.001 --> 23:51.259
He's got, like, longer brown hair.

23:51.260 --> 23:56.000
Has an accent and/or
spoke another language.

23:58.857 --> 24:00.759
I think he's scared.

24:00.760 --> 24:06.580
And there's a lot of violence
around him and in his life.

24:06.930 --> 24:08.940
Now, Cindy, was Adolphus married?

24:08.941 --> 24:14.823
Yes, he was. His first wife, Mary, was
married to him the 29th of January of 1886.

24:14.824 --> 24:16.935
And they had seven children together.

24:16.936 --> 24:20.343
Okay. Now you mentioned he had
unthinkable tragedy in his life.

24:20.344 --> 24:21.202
What was it?

24:21.203 --> 24:25.515
All of the children died as infants,
except for his daughter Julia.

24:25.516 --> 24:29.339
She died as a teenager from
consumption at the age of 17.

24:29.340 --> 24:31.223
But all the babies died.

24:31.224 --> 24:34.259
Oh. So, what were the
reasons for their death?

24:34.260 --> 24:37.636
Childhood diseases that we
didn't have any medicines for.

24:37.637 --> 24:40.866
Typhoid, diphtheria, cholera, measles.

24:40.867 --> 24:43.703
Wow. So, he buried all of his kids.

24:43.704 --> 24:46.344
That's correct.

24:50.909 --> 24:55.109
During my opening, I saw a graveyard.

24:57.283 --> 25:01.911
So I go to go in, and I notice that
I have to, like, really crouch down

25:01.912 --> 25:05.301
and walk through the opening
because it was super short.

25:05.302 --> 25:09.117
When I was going through
it, my thought was...

25:09.118 --> 25:11.898
That it was something that
was built for children.

25:11.899 --> 25:17.799
And I hear a voice say, "it was
awful. It took so many of them".

25:19.163 --> 25:23.110
So now, married this woman. Married,
they had seven kids. All seven kids died.

25:23.111 --> 25:26.215
You said it was his first wife,
though. What happened with Mary?

25:26.216 --> 25:29.449
Mary passed away in 1898 of consumption.

25:29.450 --> 25:31.994
And here is her death certificate.

25:31.995 --> 25:33.786
Consumption is Tuberculosis, right?

25:33.787 --> 25:37.147
- That's correct.
- Okay.

25:37.763 --> 25:42.261
In 1901, he remarried a relative
of Mary's named Elizabeth.

25:42.262 --> 25:43.868
Okay. Now, did they have kids together?

25:43.869 --> 25:46.498
No, unfortunately, they
didn't have children together.

25:46.499 --> 25:50.339
She also died shortly thereafter.

25:50.503 --> 25:54.540
Now, with all this tragedy in his life,
what wound up happening with Adolphus?

25:54.541 --> 26:00.361
Adolphus, on November 21st,
1916, drowned in Lake St. Clair.

26:00.381 --> 26:05.785
He was lost on the ice, and his body
was not found until the following spring.

26:05.786 --> 26:08.258
- Okay.
- And they ruled it accidental?

26:08.259 --> 26:09.607
Yes.

26:09.608 --> 26:11.671
And how old was he when he died?

26:11.672 --> 26:13.413
He was 55 years old.

26:13.414 --> 26:17.964
This guy lived a pretty tragic
life for a man only 55 years old.

26:17.965 --> 26:21.145
And a very tragic end.

26:29.575 --> 26:31.963
I'm having a sketch artist
draw the two entities

26:31.964 --> 26:34.683
who stood out the most from my walk.

26:34.684 --> 26:36.949
First, the dark, slithering man.

26:36.950 --> 26:39.430
He doesn't have...

26:39.431 --> 26:41.487
Like, any legs.

26:41.488 --> 26:45.868
He still has, like, his head and torso.

26:46.125 --> 26:50.145
And he's wrapped in a black mist.

26:50.998 --> 26:55.634
Next, I described the bizarre
scene I saw in one of the bedrooms.

26:55.635 --> 26:57.553
There's a child.

26:57.554 --> 27:00.614
Sitting, cross-legged.

27:00.941 --> 27:03.937
So, what he's looking at is...

27:03.938 --> 27:06.473
These rod-shaped...

27:06.474 --> 27:08.934
White lights.

27:08.948 --> 27:12.023
That are moving across his room.

27:12.024 --> 27:13.944
Okay.

27:20.826 --> 27:24.126
Yes. That's what I saw.

27:45.491 --> 27:48.050
Now that Amy and I have
completed our investigations.

27:48.051 --> 27:53.951
We're ready to reveal our findings to each
other and our clients for the first time.

27:55.530 --> 27:56.998
This is Erich and Emily.

27:56.999 --> 28:00.067
They live in this home with
their two sets of twins.

28:00.068 --> 28:04.974
Things have gotten so bad in this house
that it's basically ripping them all apart.

28:04.975 --> 28:07.531
It's at the point where
it got very physical,

28:07.532 --> 28:09.599
and it looks like it's
directed more towards Emily.

28:09.600 --> 28:13.410
But the concern is that it's going
to affect their children soon.

28:13.411 --> 28:16.777
What they want to know is if they can
actually live here in a safe manner.

28:16.778 --> 28:19.225
Now that Amy understands a
little bit about what's going on,

28:19.226 --> 28:23.606
she's going to tell us about her walk.

28:25.476 --> 28:29.768
In my opening, I did see
something that really stood out,

28:29.769 --> 28:32.824
and it was a little disturbing to me.

28:32.825 --> 28:36.161
There was a graveyard that
was built for children.

28:36.162 --> 28:41.611
Then, I heard someone say that
there was a terrible accident.

28:41.612 --> 28:44.020
And that many of them had died.

28:44.021 --> 28:46.908
- So you saw a lot of dead kids?
- Yes.

28:46.909 --> 28:51.575
Well, your house is not that old, but
the property goes back into the 1800s.

28:51.576 --> 28:55.105
And the original owner of your
property was a guy named Noah Furton.

28:55.106 --> 29:01.006
And he had lost, back in 1891,
two sons to measles within a week.

29:02.537 --> 29:05.027
One was two years old.
One was two months old.

29:05.028 --> 29:08.912
What's worse is he had a cousin
named Adolphus that lived with him.

29:08.913 --> 29:11.867
All of Adolphus' seven kids died young.

29:11.868 --> 29:16.872
Six of them died under the age of
one, and one died at the age of 17.

29:16.873 --> 29:18.733
Wow.

29:19.060 --> 29:22.000
It's like a curse.

29:25.177 --> 29:31.077
The next thing that I got was that
this property is not good for men.

29:32.151 --> 29:38.051
Whatever is here on this property,
can cause them to kind of go crazy.

29:38.074 --> 29:41.194
Or even to drop dead.

29:42.528 --> 29:46.421
It absolutely has killed in the past.

29:46.422 --> 29:50.322
And it's, to me, very dangerous.

29:50.851 --> 29:53.567
It's interesting you say that
it's bad for men because...

29:53.568 --> 29:56.435
Well, this guy, Noah, that lost
two his children, right, to measles.

29:56.436 --> 30:00.336
Now, his wife died at 49 of TB.

30:01.012 --> 30:04.224
So he lost two kids and lost his wife.

30:04.225 --> 30:06.223
And next, we talk about Adolphus.

30:06.224 --> 30:10.238
Loses seven kids and then
two wives on top of that.

30:10.239 --> 30:13.827
Lost his first wife
at 29 to Tuberculosis.

30:13.828 --> 30:19.482
Remarries and loses his second wife
within a year or two after he got married.

30:19.483 --> 30:22.838
So he never even had children with her.

30:22.839 --> 30:27.464
Not only that, he wound up dying
under strange circumstances.

30:27.465 --> 30:29.635
Even though Adolphus was
an experienced sailor,

30:29.636 --> 30:33.099
he ends up drowning in Lake St. Clair.

30:33.100 --> 30:35.844
Here's his death certificate.

30:35.845 --> 30:38.022
They ruled it accidental drowning.

30:38.023 --> 30:41.263
But who the hell knows?

30:42.299 --> 30:47.639
The next thing that I
encountered was a dead person.

30:49.075 --> 30:52.194
And I see him come out from...

30:52.195 --> 30:55.075
Underneath the car.

30:55.458 --> 30:57.845
He doesn't have any
arms or legs anymore,

30:57.846 --> 31:02.766
so he's, like, a black,
slithery, snaky thing.

31:03.428 --> 31:06.085
I felt like he lived here before.

31:06.086 --> 31:11.342
The fear that I felt was really
overwhelming and powerful.

31:11.343 --> 31:15.779
You know, when you get that really
tight sensation in your stomach?

31:15.780 --> 31:19.689
And you almost feel like
you're going to pass out?

31:19.690 --> 31:22.640
Yeah, that's kind of how I felt.

31:22.641 --> 31:24.575
Have you seen this person?

31:24.576 --> 31:30.032
I don't know if they're the same
person, but I see a man in a hat.

31:30.033 --> 31:32.204
Is he intimidating to you?

31:32.205 --> 31:34.101
He's scary.

31:34.102 --> 31:37.462
- Okay.
- He just stares.

31:37.989 --> 31:42.223
I did do a sketch of the man that I saw.

31:42.224 --> 31:46.664
The way he moved for me was snake-like.

31:49.678 --> 31:51.598
Whoa.

31:53.963 --> 31:55.763
Mm.

32:06.183 --> 32:09.253
Is there any chance that this guy
here could be one of the Furtons?

32:09.254 --> 32:11.774
Very possible.

32:15.293 --> 32:19.830
So, walking into the
house, it was chaos.

32:19.831 --> 32:24.702
Very, very physically painful,
and it was just overwhelming.

32:24.703 --> 32:28.360
What I finally figured
is that there's three main

32:28.361 --> 32:31.740
experiences that you
guys would encounter.

32:31.741 --> 32:35.701
The first thing is physical abuse.

32:35.803 --> 32:39.668
And this seemed to
be directed towards...

32:39.669 --> 32:41.649
Women.

32:41.835 --> 32:46.737
I got grabbed by the back of my
neck, like, right under the ears.

32:46.738 --> 32:49.596
And I could feel the
whole hand. Male's hand.

32:49.597 --> 32:52.897
Very strong. Grabbing me.

32:53.089 --> 32:56.269
It really hurt. A lot.

32:56.645 --> 33:00.290
Um, I've had my hair pulled.

33:00.291 --> 33:02.691
Three times.

33:03.366 --> 33:06.632
Tell her what happens
when you take a shower.

33:06.633 --> 33:09.128
- It's like a burn.
- Okay.

33:09.129 --> 33:11.626
And it's happened four times.

33:11.627 --> 33:14.314
All four times, I was in the shower.

33:14.315 --> 33:17.615
I actually have a photo.

33:19.935 --> 33:22.635
Whoa! Okay. Wow.

33:24.351 --> 33:30.251
I mean, I'm overwhelmed with all of
the things that are going on here.

33:31.629 --> 33:34.811
So you said people here are being
affected by three different things.

33:34.812 --> 33:35.985
What else?

33:35.986 --> 33:38.869
I pretty much had a constant headache.

33:38.870 --> 33:43.550
Um, and nausea, feeling
sick to my stomach.

33:45.665 --> 33:49.505
I also felt that my heart hurt.

33:51.698 --> 33:54.851
You seem pretty upset
by what she's saying.

33:54.852 --> 33:59.772
I had a heart attack
last year for no reason.

34:03.262 --> 34:06.924
When we spoke, you didn't mention it.
Are you uncomfortable talking about it?

34:06.925 --> 34:08.842
Yeah. It's scary.

34:08.844 --> 34:11.927
I'm 38 years old. It's
not supposed to happen.

34:11.928 --> 34:14.123
- Right.
- What happened?

34:14.125 --> 34:15.766
The doctors can't explain it.

34:15.766 --> 34:19.436
She's been through more tests than
any other person I know in my life.

34:19.437 --> 34:23.679
And every day, I have
horrible, horrible headaches.

34:23.679 --> 34:26.543
- How do you sleep at night?
- I don't sleep much at night.

34:26.545 --> 34:29.213
Tell her where you sleep, so
you can be close to the kids.

34:29.214 --> 34:31.924
- I sleep on the couch.
- Uh huh.

34:31.925 --> 34:35.976
It's difficult, you know. You want
to have your significant other laying

34:35.978 --> 34:40.318
next to you, and not
upstairs, away from you.

34:40.319 --> 34:43.510
So, now you said there's three things
they're dealing with in this house.

34:43.511 --> 34:47.096
Physical abuse. Sickness.
And what was the third thing?

34:47.097 --> 34:50.877
The other thing was the voices.

34:51.742 --> 34:56.428
When I got into the kids' room,
it was crazy out of control.

34:56.429 --> 34:59.931
In that particular room, these
voices were not coming from the dead.

34:59.932 --> 35:03.772
They were coming from the walls.

35:04.886 --> 35:07.268
Yeah. We all hear it every day.

35:07.269 --> 35:09.645
You guys are validated for
what you're going through here.

35:09.646 --> 35:14.626
Definitely. More than I
could have ever thought.

35:20.495 --> 35:24.510
So, there was another sketch that I did.

35:24.511 --> 35:28.500
In the kids' room, where the
voices were coming from the walls...

35:28.501 --> 35:32.821
I saw something else that disturbed me.

35:49.207 --> 35:51.980
Have either one of you ever
seen anything like that?

35:51.981 --> 35:54.801
We both see them.

35:55.233 --> 35:58.816
I call them strings of light.

35:58.817 --> 36:00.498
Where are they coming from?

36:00.499 --> 36:06.399
This is one of the things that
happen in poltergeist hauntings.

36:07.242 --> 36:10.424
And it's been going on for a while.

36:10.425 --> 36:16.185
So it has developed into a
full-blown poltergeist haunting.

36:17.081 --> 36:22.981
So, these strings of light that
we see, that's a poltergeist?

36:44.142 --> 36:49.782
This has developed into a
full-blown poltergeist haunting.

36:51.282 --> 36:57.182
So, these strings of light that
we see, that's a poltergeist?

36:59.210 --> 37:03.350
And it was created by living agents.

37:05.616 --> 37:09.636
I almost feel like it's my fault.

37:12.262 --> 37:16.642
Well, you both seem to have abilities...

37:18.290 --> 37:22.490
That have spontaneously been activated.

37:23.959 --> 37:29.110
You had this heart attack, which basically
was kind of a near-death situation.

37:29.111 --> 37:33.625
Highly stressful, and I
think that completely...

37:33.626 --> 37:38.914
Did away with you being closed
in any way, shape, or form.

37:38.915 --> 37:43.341
And I think that you are
in an active location.

37:43.342 --> 37:48.622
So, inadvertently, were
made to open to some extent.

37:48.939 --> 37:53.970
The other thing is, is that
we can become extremely ill.

37:53.971 --> 37:57.151
Because of the ability.

37:59.308 --> 38:04.828
Every physical medium that
I know has had heart issues.

38:06.221 --> 38:09.615
So, what does the
poltergeist haunting do?

38:09.616 --> 38:11.794
So, like, all of this
energy is out there,

38:11.795 --> 38:14.573
and it's going and it's
going and it builds...

38:14.574 --> 38:17.552
Spontaneously affecting the environment.

38:17.553 --> 38:21.785
Then what can happen is it
can feed off of the dead.

38:21.786 --> 38:25.146
So, with this guy here...

38:26.646 --> 38:30.087
He's being absorbed and then becoming...

38:30.088 --> 38:33.688
Part of this ball of energy.

38:33.869 --> 38:36.634
And what can happen then is
when you're adding your abilities

38:36.635 --> 38:41.256
to that ball of energy, it
can become a PK manifestation.

38:41.257 --> 38:45.146
Which is a very dire circumstance.

38:45.147 --> 38:47.720
Pk, from what I understand,
that can make things move.

38:47.721 --> 38:49.383
- Like, objects move.
- Yes.

38:49.384 --> 38:51.959
You'll have the objects
moving, emotional instability,

38:51.960 --> 38:54.668
and some of the physical phenomena.

38:54.669 --> 38:59.536
That's when you're getting
the deep cuts and...

38:59.537 --> 39:05.338
You know, being thrown across the
room, and, you know, hardcore...

39:05.339 --> 39:07.451
Physical...

39:07.452 --> 39:09.404
Abuse.

39:09.405 --> 39:15.305
I don't think it's gotten to that level
yet, but I think it is headed there.

39:20.709 --> 39:22.629
Phew.

39:27.112 --> 39:30.692
This is a lot of information
to take in one night and...

39:30.693 --> 39:34.005
It probably wasn't the information you
actually thought you were going to hear.

39:34.006 --> 39:36.886
But the main question is
can you live here safely?

39:36.887 --> 39:40.270
Could the kids be safe? And
can you fix what's going on?

39:40.271 --> 39:44.700
Hopefully, Amy may
have an answer for that.

39:44.701 --> 39:47.522
We need to get the
dead out of the house.

39:47.523 --> 39:53.423
So, to start off, you're going to be
doing home cleansings three times a week.

39:53.719 --> 39:55.647
Go ahead and take your Sage.

39:55.648 --> 39:59.643
Go around the house with the
Sage and just let it burn freely.

39:59.644 --> 40:01.744
While you're saying...

40:01.745 --> 40:04.376
"Only love, light, and peace may enter".

40:04.377 --> 40:08.865
And any dead that are in
the home have to leave.

40:08.866 --> 40:10.093
Okay.

40:10.094 --> 40:15.022
Also, to eliminate this
poltergeist and to have everyone,

40:15.023 --> 40:18.589
balanced and centered
with their energy...

40:18.590 --> 40:23.630
I would suggest either
yoga, tai chi, or qigong.

40:24.126 --> 40:28.806
At least once a week
as a family together.

40:29.381 --> 40:31.708
Now, let me ask you a
question a poltergeist sounds

40:31.709 --> 40:34.374
to a layman like me, it sounds
like a scary thing, right?

40:34.375 --> 40:35.353
Oh, yeah.

40:35.354 --> 40:39.042
But you're saying yoga's going
to kind of nip it in the bud?

40:39.043 --> 40:43.020
Yes. It'll dissipate because
you won't be feeding it anymore.

40:43.021 --> 40:46.794
You'll feel much healthier,
you'll feel much more at peace.

40:46.795 --> 40:50.628
Because it will focus on
harnessing and balancing energy.

40:50.629 --> 40:51.893
Okay.

40:51.894 --> 40:53.852
So, what's going to happen to this guy?

40:53.853 --> 40:57.873
Once the poltergeist is dissipating.

40:58.271 --> 41:04.171
It's going to release him, and I think, at
that point, he's going to choose to leave.

41:05.036 --> 41:08.986
And what can they do about
this thing that's bad for men?

41:08.987 --> 41:13.468
There's something that comes
from the Earth here that...

41:13.469 --> 41:17.010
Doesn't particularly care
for men for whatever reason.

41:17.011 --> 41:21.066
So, I would suggest
bringing in a Shaman.

41:21.067 --> 41:25.447
To do a cleansing ceremony on the land.

41:25.897 --> 41:27.817
Okay.

41:28.015 --> 41:31.597
Now, this whole thing of you having
abilities actually, the both of you.

41:31.598 --> 41:34.720
When you woke up this morning this would've
been the last thing you thought of.

41:34.721 --> 41:39.101
The last thing I thought of, absolutely.

41:39.729 --> 41:45.629
So, the big question is, are you
going to listen to our advice?

41:46.350 --> 41:47.752
Absolutely.

41:47.753 --> 41:48.813
Definitely.

41:48.814 --> 41:51.874
- Okay. Good.
- Okay.

41:52.767 --> 41:56.946
I really hope Emily & Erich rid their
home of the poltergeist they've created.

41:56.947 --> 41:59.856
If they do that and learn
to harness their abilities,

41:59.857 --> 42:05.757
there is no reason they shouldn't live
in their home peacefully as a family.
