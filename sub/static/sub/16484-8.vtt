00:00.257 --> 00:03.092
They say that when you stop looking
love finds you.

00:03.117 --> 00:04.937
And what happens if it hasn't found her?

00:04.962 --> 00:07.482
This isn't a peace treaty, it's my
surrender.

00:07.507 --> 00:09.907
I can't be seen to lose my own
divorce, can I?

00:09.932 --> 00:13.452
You've got me through all this.
That's why we need to celebrate.

00:13.506 --> 00:16.344
- Don't!
- - Get a room, you two.

00:16.369 --> 00:19.209
There's a real possibility I'll be
convicted and sent to prison.

00:19.234 --> 00:21.634
I have your confession, from your own lips.

00:22.011 --> 00:23.491
Oh, shit.

00:23.531 --> 00:27.731
If you're shallow enough to be swayed
by cheap flowers then he deserves you.

00:31.523 --> 00:33.762
I've left her.
It's you I wanna be with.

00:41.630 --> 00:45.099
Bloody great birthday, this is, huh?
No-one's free, not even David.

00:45.404 --> 00:48.531
- You should have told more people.
- I didn't want to make a fuss.

00:49.505 --> 00:51.419
Well, I did drop some subtle hints.

00:51.489 --> 00:54.005
- My favourite number is...
- Mine's 18.

00:54.030 --> 00:56.612
That's my birthday.
This month, as it happens.

00:56.637 --> 00:57.891
No big deal.

00:57.931 --> 01:00.090
- What star sign are you?
- Pisces.

01:00.254 --> 01:02.624
I'm Aries.
18th of this month.

01:03.538 --> 01:05.333
A week on Saturday, in fact.

01:05.945 --> 01:07.853
Ten days' time.

01:13.085 --> 01:14.350
Subtle.

01:19.131 --> 01:21.155
Worst birthday ever.

01:21.507 --> 01:23.022
Oh, for God's sake.

01:23.047 --> 01:25.052
Look, I'm not supposed to tell you this.

01:25.077 --> 01:30.517
The reason why no-one's here is
they're helping Tina decorate your apartment.

01:30.542 --> 01:32.422
I'm moving out tomorrow.
Couldn't she wait?

01:32.547 --> 01:34.362
It's a surprise birthday.

01:35.793 --> 01:37.588
- Hiya!
- Hi, Pete.

01:37.707 --> 01:39.721
You know it's Adam's birthday this weekend?

01:39.746 --> 01:41.949
Oh, he's not been on at you as well, has he?

01:41.974 --> 01:45.941
I don't know if you're doing anything for him,
but we could have a party for him here.

01:46.802 --> 01:48.394
She offered.

01:49.187 --> 01:51.227
I may be tempted to read something into that.

01:51.267 --> 01:53.982
You might.
She thought it'd double up as a leaving do.

01:54.007 --> 01:56.319
- I bet Jamie's not wild about it.
- Her married man?

01:56.343 --> 01:59.983
- He's now her live-in lover.
- I don't think he'll mind. He's invited.

02:00.103 --> 02:02.753
Oh.
Bollocks.

02:06.903 --> 02:09.323
Still, a party, though, eh?

02:09.376 --> 02:12.152
I thought I was condemned to a really
boring night in the pub.

02:12.177 --> 02:13.393
Thanks.

02:14.643 --> 02:16.767
Oh, try and look surprised
when you get there.

02:16.792 --> 02:17.992
Yeah.

02:18.226 --> 02:20.586
Surprise!

02:25.977 --> 02:29.217
Oh, naughty, naughty, naughty.

02:35.787 --> 02:37.021
Er...

02:38.887 --> 02:40.146
Oh...

02:41.107 --> 02:42.447
What?

02:44.507 --> 02:45.987
- Hello.
- Hi.

02:46.139 --> 02:48.339
Er, I'm 49.

02:49.253 --> 02:51.893
- I was sure you were 50.
- Why?

02:52.813 --> 02:55.653
You made such a fuss.
I thought it must be a significant number.

02:55.693 --> 03:00.002
49 is. It's the last time I will be
40-something. Nobody wants to be 50.

03:00.676 --> 03:02.636
Well, just look at it as practice.

03:03.387 --> 03:05.705
Besides, none of this lot will notice.

03:06.202 --> 03:09.108
While we're at it, who are they?
I don't know half of them.

03:09.133 --> 03:13.093
I figured you didn't know that many people
so I padded it out with some mates of mine.

03:13.133 --> 03:16.093
Oh. 50 and friendless.
Brilliant.

03:18.013 --> 03:19.273
Thanks.

03:28.774 --> 03:31.126
- Happy 50th.
- I'm not 50.

03:31.151 --> 03:33.540
- How does it feel to be 50, then?
- I've no idea.

03:34.693 --> 03:36.251
I'm not 50.

03:36.820 --> 03:39.653
I didn't think that you and David
were going to make it in time.

03:39.693 --> 03:42.613
- Well, he didn't.
- You were cutting it a bit fine.

03:42.773 --> 03:45.653
I know, I had a meeting.
I was trying to sign a new author.

03:45.693 --> 03:47.096
How did that go?

03:47.853 --> 03:50.013
You must have interest from a lot of
publishers.

03:50.053 --> 03:52.253
A million readers online,
they all come running.

03:53.697 --> 03:57.977
- Well, you're up to 1.2 now.
- Shit.

03:58.517 --> 04:00.773
This is going off.
Very exciting.

04:00.892 --> 04:02.595
And pretty terrifying, I imagine.

04:02.620 --> 04:05.104
They promise me the earth.
Movie deals, endorsements.

04:05.129 --> 04:07.468
You must be wondering
how you choose who to go with.

04:07.493 --> 04:10.053
Yeah. They all just tell me how
brilliant I am.

04:10.093 --> 04:12.873
Friday, your book is going
to be a huge success, regardless.

04:12.898 --> 04:15.475
But I think it can be so much more
than that, I really do.

04:15.500 --> 04:17.959
If we're smart about how we use
social media...

04:17.985 --> 04:21.834
That's my job. And I'm as good
in my field as Karen is in hers.

04:22.311 --> 04:26.674
But, do you know what, if it works, we're
looking at so much more than a bestseller here.

04:27.732 --> 04:30.773
There's a lot to think about,
and it's a really important decision.

04:30.915 --> 04:32.616
I've already decided.

04:34.933 --> 04:36.933
I want to work with you.

04:38.868 --> 04:42.893
- My first author.
- Congratulations. We should celebrate, right?

04:42.933 --> 04:44.212
I already did.

04:49.228 --> 04:52.293
What?
I thought that was meant to be a one-off.

04:52.333 --> 04:55.573
- It was. Won't happen again.
- A two-off?

04:55.613 --> 04:58.027
No, no, it won't happen, seriously,
we both agreed.

04:58.052 --> 04:59.893
Right, yeah.
Like last time.

05:00.034 --> 05:02.573
- Jenny.
- Karen, sorry I'm late.

05:02.613 --> 05:05.932
- Have you been drinking?
- I've had a meeting with my lawyer.

05:06.713 --> 05:09.133
- Cup of tea, Floyd?
- If you're having one.

05:09.752 --> 05:11.517
- I won't, thanks.
- Dad?

05:12.019 --> 05:13.587
I'm in the kitchen, Liv.

05:14.681 --> 05:18.053
Hi. Robin just dropped me off.
She wanted me to give you this.

05:18.595 --> 05:19.970
And guess what?

05:20.097 --> 05:22.759
She's offered to take me on
once I've done a law degree.

05:22.797 --> 05:24.077
Great.

05:28.333 --> 05:29.693
She's rolled over.

05:30.653 --> 05:32.413
She's agreed to a quickie divorce.

05:32.762 --> 05:34.006
David, that's great.

05:34.031 --> 05:36.453
It's due to you
and the talking you gave her.

05:36.493 --> 05:37.895
It was magnificent.

05:37.920 --> 05:40.093
That deserves a drink to celebrate.

05:40.418 --> 05:42.267
- I haven't finished yet.
- Oh.

05:42.486 --> 05:45.150
Why are you here, Floyd?
Come to burst my bubble?

05:45.478 --> 05:48.853
A remarkable thing has happened.
Your firm has changed its story.

05:48.998 --> 05:50.509
- What?
- They've found some emails

05:50.533 --> 05:53.893
that undermine the case against you.
They've handed them to the CPS

05:53.933 --> 05:57.991
who I've just heard have decided
to drop all charges against you.

05:58.186 --> 06:00.013
That's why I've been drinking.

06:00.053 --> 06:03.053
- You're off the hook. Whoa.
- The recording you made.

06:03.093 --> 06:05.053
The boss didn't realise it was useless.

06:05.194 --> 06:07.453
But he filed it, anyway.
Stupid bastard.

06:08.181 --> 06:10.341
I am going to get smashed.

06:12.718 --> 06:13.918
Ooh.

06:18.333 --> 06:20.417
We kissed.
We properly kissed.

06:20.464 --> 06:24.933
Then that dickhead turns up, serenading her.
I mean, who sings to women nowadays?

06:24.973 --> 06:26.751
- You sang to Rachel.
- It was different.

06:26.775 --> 06:28.935
- Why?
- I had a rose up my arse.

06:29.134 --> 06:32.986
I mean, everyone knows that married men who
are having affairs don't leave their wives.

06:33.011 --> 06:34.253
- It's a fact.
- Listen,

06:34.293 --> 06:37.573
- maybe his wife kicked him out.
- Oh, yeah, that could be it.

06:37.613 --> 06:39.417
He's on the street, turns up at Tina's.

06:39.442 --> 06:42.658
It's not the fact that he moved out,
it's the fact that she took him in.

06:42.683 --> 06:44.933
I thought something might happen between us.

06:44.973 --> 06:47.270
Come on. Hang on in there.
You never know.

06:47.295 --> 06:50.773
I mean, listen, it's one thing
having an affair with someone,

06:50.846 --> 06:54.260
quite another having to wash their
grundies of an evening.

06:54.285 --> 06:57.713
That's it. There's nothing kills
romance quite like living together, eh?

06:57.738 --> 07:02.218
I just need to sit back, bide my time,
and wait for the car crash to happen.

07:02.453 --> 07:05.959
- Except, you move out in a few days.
- Oh.

07:06.428 --> 07:09.413
Listen, you need to nudge it along a bit,

07:09.859 --> 07:11.521
because the girl crash.

07:24.013 --> 07:25.933
Hello!

07:25.973 --> 07:28.613
Ohh!
Party, party!

07:29.230 --> 07:30.456
Ramona.

07:32.839 --> 07:35.573
So when Joshie say he coming home,
I think why not I come too?

07:35.776 --> 07:37.925
And then I hear it's your party.

07:38.292 --> 07:39.559
Ooh, you're 50.

07:39.614 --> 07:42.013
- No.
- It's great to see you, Ramona.

07:42.053 --> 07:43.853
And my little boy.

07:46.012 --> 07:50.373
- Who's this, then?
- This? This is Juan, my boyfriend.

07:50.608 --> 07:53.905
- He no speak no English.
- Oh. Hola.

07:54.293 --> 07:56.333
- Respect, Ramona.
- Yeah.

07:56.373 --> 07:58.881
He'll do.
But, Jenny, you look fantastic.

07:58.906 --> 08:01.014
That's what I keep telling Pete.

08:01.193 --> 08:05.155
He look a little bit older
but not so fat, I think.

08:05.238 --> 08:06.838
- Josh!
- Dad.

08:07.020 --> 08:09.777
- How lovely to see... Ramona?
- David.

08:09.963 --> 08:13.089
Joshie, what wonderful timing.
You can join our celebration.

08:13.114 --> 08:15.813
- Yeah, for Adam's 50.
- Jesus.

08:16.004 --> 08:18.293
That as well, but, I mean, me not
facing jail.

08:19.105 --> 08:20.773
- Jail?
- Your mum didn't tell you?

08:20.813 --> 08:23.693
- I didn't think you wanted him to know.
- Too late for that now.

08:47.733 --> 08:48.933
Hello.

08:49.220 --> 08:51.813
I haven't had a chance to catch you
on your own.

08:51.853 --> 08:54.236
- No.
- I don't mean just tonight.

08:54.261 --> 08:55.899
I mean, since...

08:57.256 --> 08:59.001
Since I slapped you.

09:02.493 --> 09:04.893
I'm sorry.
That should never have happened.

09:06.506 --> 09:08.266
Thanks for organising tonight.

09:09.404 --> 09:10.764
You didn't have to.

09:10.789 --> 09:13.309
- That's what Jamie said.
- Oh, yeah, I bet he did.

09:14.773 --> 09:18.853
If I were him, I'd have written my
own song, not nick someone else's.

09:18.893 --> 09:21.133
Yeah, but you're not him, are you?

09:22.360 --> 09:23.640
No.

09:27.308 --> 09:28.988
This is my mate, Deanne.

09:29.333 --> 09:31.933
I thought you two might like to meet
each other.

09:32.909 --> 09:34.909
I'm single too.

09:41.333 --> 09:42.573
Ohh!

09:42.891 --> 09:44.258
I'm empty.

09:45.060 --> 09:46.734
Do you want to fill me up?

09:51.708 --> 09:53.628
You're very forward, aren't you?

09:53.724 --> 09:57.534
- I've only known you five minutes.
- You said you wanted to see the roof terrace.

10:00.360 --> 10:01.640
Are you all right?

10:06.079 --> 10:07.415
I shouldn't really.

10:07.680 --> 10:09.429
I'm anyone's after three.

10:10.024 --> 10:11.946
And this'll be my fifth.

10:13.009 --> 10:16.916
So, Tina tells me your
marriage only lasted six weeks.

10:17.189 --> 10:20.656
Great. Cos that is the one thing that
you really want people to know about you.

10:20.680 --> 10:24.577
I thought, "Steer well clear.
He sounds a disaster."

10:25.244 --> 10:26.618
So, why are you here?

10:27.613 --> 10:29.667
Well, I'm not exactly spoilt for
choice, am I?

10:29.692 --> 10:31.347
Oh, thanks very much.

10:31.544 --> 10:33.886
I'm messing with you.

10:36.149 --> 10:39.358
No. It's cos of what else she said
about you.

10:40.483 --> 10:43.834
- Really?
- Mm.

10:47.749 --> 10:49.069
Tell me more, Deanne.

10:56.888 --> 10:59.060
It's been wonderful being a family again.

10:59.589 --> 11:01.909
It's like the years have just fallen away.

11:03.189 --> 11:05.764
But you're only staying
a short time, I think.

11:05.926 --> 11:08.131
Oh, Karen hasn't said anything, but...

11:11.349 --> 11:13.549
How would you describe me, Ramona?

11:13.876 --> 11:16.430
- I'm sorry?
- You haven't seen me for a while.

11:16.511 --> 11:19.204
I was just wondering
what your perception of me is.

11:20.559 --> 11:21.956
Well, I...

11:23.360 --> 11:25.389
Oh, David, you're a very nice man.

11:25.429 --> 11:27.397
No, no, no, I'm not your employer any more.

11:27.422 --> 11:31.622
If you think I'm in any way
insensitive or aloof or self-absorbed,

11:31.750 --> 11:33.546
you're quite at liberty to say.

11:34.362 --> 11:36.602
Yeah, I think so.

11:37.290 --> 11:39.438
- Which?
- All of them.

11:41.433 --> 11:42.873
I suppose you're right.

11:43.109 --> 11:46.016
Because recently I had a period
of forced self-reflection.

11:46.229 --> 11:50.518
I realised that the reason I'm not happy
is that I don't like the person I've become.

11:51.067 --> 11:54.986
I want to be a better man, Ramona,
the man that Karen once fell in love with.

11:55.229 --> 11:57.549
I want to be worthy of her love again.

11:58.629 --> 12:00.274
I think I can be.

12:00.383 --> 12:02.063
Oh, David.

12:02.274 --> 12:05.164
You know, the fact that you are
saying all of this...

12:05.614 --> 12:09.434
- maybe you're already getting there.
- I hope so, Ramona.

12:10.869 --> 12:12.184
I really do.

12:19.543 --> 12:21.569
Pete looks like he's having a good time.

12:21.679 --> 12:23.728
Yeah, that's cos he's on a cocktail.

12:23.885 --> 12:26.896
- Looks like beer.
- Booze and meds.

12:26.921 --> 12:29.900
He's slowly coming off 'em,
but they're still having an impact.

12:29.925 --> 12:31.525
That's a good thing, isn't it?

12:31.550 --> 12:33.011
He's happier.

12:33.112 --> 12:36.634
Actually, so much so
that we decided to celebrate,

12:36.659 --> 12:39.893
like you did when you landed that author.

12:42.854 --> 12:44.898
We haven't had sex for months.

12:44.946 --> 12:47.066
I should be gagging for it by now.

12:48.019 --> 12:50.359
It's the pills.
It's a known side effect.

12:51.368 --> 12:53.088
I feel dead from the waist down.

12:54.192 --> 12:56.192
You're not dead.

12:56.546 --> 12:58.506
You're just numb.

12:59.516 --> 13:01.464
- Oh, no. No, no, no, no, love.
- No?

13:01.489 --> 13:03.369
No, love, please, don't touch me there.

13:04.484 --> 13:06.641
What if...

13:06.836 --> 13:08.789
- Yeah?
- It's old age?

13:09.709 --> 13:12.792
- What if, when I was depressed...
- Yeah?

13:13.114 --> 13:14.894
My libido's dried up.

13:17.037 --> 13:19.550
I don't think that's what libidos do, love.

13:21.824 --> 13:23.391
Oh, Jen.

13:24.515 --> 13:26.422
I just want us to be how we were.

13:28.065 --> 13:30.725
We will. Don't worry.

13:32.949 --> 13:35.069
It's another month till he's off his meds.

13:35.305 --> 13:38.805
Look, we've waited this long,
we can wait another four weeks.

13:49.562 --> 13:52.257
- Where's your date?
- Passed out, God willing.

13:52.442 --> 13:55.681
- I don't know what Tina was thinking.
- Ask her.

13:56.682 --> 14:00.400
You know, well,
if he ever lets her go, maybe I will.

14:04.545 --> 14:06.081
Woo!

14:11.702 --> 14:13.542
Do you think Ramona knows he's gay?

14:13.800 --> 14:15.837
What makes you think he is?

14:17.053 --> 14:20.062
- Just cos you two can't dance.
- Not like that, we can't.

14:20.564 --> 14:22.462
He's Spanish.
It's in their blood.

14:22.923 --> 14:25.142
- Homosexuality?
- Dance.

14:25.181 --> 14:29.290
I tell you what, if I was Ramona
and I had that writhing all over me...

14:29.477 --> 14:30.891
I wouldn't care if he was gay.

14:31.103 --> 14:33.157
Aye, aye, I think he's looking this way.

14:33.625 --> 14:35.523
- Oh, look.
- Look, look, look, look.

14:35.695 --> 14:39.390
- Yeah, it's you. Go on, fill your boots.
- Go on, have it.

14:39.452 --> 14:40.662
- Really?
- Yeah.

14:42.763 --> 14:45.791
- OK.
- There she goes.

14:48.603 --> 14:52.985
I hear you and Jen tried to get back
to doing what married couples do.

14:53.163 --> 14:55.141
- Arguing?
- I mean sex.

14:55.243 --> 14:57.523
Went off half-cocked, I gather.

14:57.563 --> 15:00.803
- Didn't reach those heights.
- Your doctor can prescribe something.

15:00.843 --> 15:02.394
- No need.
- You're cured?

15:02.420 --> 15:04.761
- I go some from a friend.
- Who?

15:04.821 --> 15:06.319
All right, chaps?

15:06.718 --> 15:08.318
Oh, Jesus.

15:14.230 --> 15:15.446
Are you sure?

15:15.504 --> 15:18.089
I don't need them.
Haven't for a while, to be honest.

15:18.114 --> 15:21.074
- What did you get them for?
- Robin. She insisted.

15:21.235 --> 15:23.314
Time was she had quite an appetite.

15:23.839 --> 15:25.643
Till she went on a starvation diet.

15:25.864 --> 15:27.645
D-D-Don't flash them about.

15:28.434 --> 15:31.899
I'm up for fraud. I don't want supply of a
controlled substance added to my charge sheet.

15:31.923 --> 15:33.715
It'd earn you more respect in prison.

15:33.858 --> 15:35.232
You're very kind.

15:35.803 --> 15:38.442
They're quite old.
They might have lost their potency.

15:38.533 --> 15:40.168
Sounds like me.

15:40.840 --> 15:42.363
Oh, Jen.

15:42.996 --> 15:44.793
I think I've done something silly.

15:46.637 --> 15:48.594
Oh, my God.

15:49.189 --> 15:51.484
- Is that natural?
- I've had help from David.

15:51.603 --> 15:55.203
- I didn't know you found him so attractive.
- I may have overdone the dose.

15:55.406 --> 15:57.610
Ugh!
On top of your anti-depressants.

15:57.643 --> 16:00.163
Honestly.
Listen, I can see that you're up for it.

16:00.203 --> 16:02.443
- You might check with me first.
- Aren't you?

16:02.483 --> 16:05.203
It's not exactly flattering.
That's chemically induced.

16:07.849 --> 16:10.243
And don't prod me with it.

16:14.238 --> 16:15.730
It was most uncomfortable.

16:15.755 --> 16:17.600
I had to sleep on my back.

16:32.133 --> 16:34.445
- Deanne thinks you're ignoring her.
- More avoiding.

16:34.624 --> 16:36.060
She's very attractive.

16:36.163 --> 16:38.609
And desperate.
Those two cancel each other out.

16:40.344 --> 16:42.694
- She told me what you said about me.
- Mm.

16:43.581 --> 16:45.781
She does have a tendency to exaggerate.

16:46.710 --> 16:50.563
Maybe me too.
Trying to persuade her of your virtues.

16:51.046 --> 16:52.616
It's not a very hard sell.

16:53.046 --> 16:55.639
Anything that has a pulse
would do it for Deanne.

16:57.522 --> 16:59.562
Would you like us to be together?

17:02.043 --> 17:03.632
Me and Deanne.

17:04.991 --> 17:07.685
Sweetheart, you mustn't monopolise
the birthday boy.

17:08.501 --> 17:11.580
Of course, it's just as much of a
farewell party, really, isn't it?

17:11.628 --> 17:14.669
Mm-hm.
What football team do you support?

17:14.693 --> 17:15.973
Chelsea.

17:22.874 --> 17:24.993
Oi, oi, oi, where are you sloping off to?

17:25.034 --> 17:27.314
The kids have drunk all the spirits;
the offie.

17:27.354 --> 17:29.354
You shouldn't have to go, it's your party.

17:29.394 --> 17:31.634
Oh, cheers, mate.
I'll come with you.

17:31.674 --> 17:33.014
What?

17:33.354 --> 17:34.959
Are you coming, then?

17:37.729 --> 17:40.038
- Where are Pete and Adam going?
- Eh?

17:40.194 --> 17:43.034
- Dunno. Pub?
- Well, they might have asked me.

17:43.327 --> 17:45.533
Well, maybe they think you've had enough.

17:45.817 --> 17:48.137
I could do with some more, Dutch courage.

17:48.684 --> 17:50.964
I'm going to suggest to Karen that I
don't move out,

17:51.043 --> 17:52.643
that we get back together,

17:52.707 --> 17:54.246
become a family again.

17:57.274 --> 17:59.554
- Karen? You're not leaving any time soon.
- No.

17:59.594 --> 18:02.794
I need to talk to you.
Just going for a drink with the boys.

18:07.074 --> 18:08.976
Ah. Shit.

18:17.607 --> 18:20.141
- Can you see the matches?
- What do you need matches for?

18:20.165 --> 18:23.543
When we go to the supermarket, it's
the one thing I forget to put on my list.

18:23.567 --> 18:25.837
- Drives me mad.
- I'm missing my birthday party.

18:25.862 --> 18:28.574
- Oh, matches. Which ones should it be?
- Oh, for God's sakes.

18:28.598 --> 18:30.973
Take a couple of boxes. Come on.

18:31.701 --> 18:33.455
Open the till!

18:33.776 --> 18:35.036
Open it!

18:41.754 --> 18:43.834
Don't move!

18:45.178 --> 18:46.738
What the fuck!

18:50.861 --> 18:52.102
Shit!

18:54.643 --> 18:55.863
Move!

18:58.514 --> 19:01.554
Holy shit!
That was scary.

19:02.051 --> 19:04.192
Oh, my God.
Whoa!

19:04.699 --> 19:05.996
Open the back.

19:06.394 --> 19:08.474
No.
You two...

19:08.514 --> 19:10.354
on the floor.
Now!

19:10.886 --> 19:12.642
Open the door or I'll shoot 'em.

19:12.667 --> 19:14.596
The police will be here in a minute.

19:15.476 --> 19:17.006
Don't move.

19:20.937 --> 19:24.657
Excuse me for not calling in advance,
but I was hoping to surprise you.

19:24.697 --> 19:28.082
Well, mission accomplished.
Again.

19:28.330 --> 19:29.530
Eddie!

19:30.777 --> 19:33.257
- Would you like something to drink?
- Yes, thank you.

19:33.297 --> 19:36.272
- A glass of red, please.
- Well, it's over by the sink.

19:40.996 --> 19:44.271
- Did you know he was coming?
- No! No idea what he's doing here.

19:46.490 --> 19:51.177
Let's everyone calm down
and we can sort this before the police...

19:51.202 --> 19:52.821
I am calm!

19:53.229 --> 19:54.669
I'm totally calm.

19:56.020 --> 19:57.508
OK.
Here's what we'll do.

19:58.047 --> 20:01.457
You raise the shutter. You...

20:01.747 --> 20:04.552
slip out the back
and we'll pretend this never happened.

20:04.577 --> 20:05.809
He's got my money.

20:06.175 --> 20:07.950
He's also got a gun.

20:08.192 --> 20:10.356
But I follow a faithless religion...

20:10.773 --> 20:13.686
OK, you give him his money back.

20:14.296 --> 20:15.777
He pays for the biscuits as well.

20:15.817 --> 20:18.483
- I'll pay for the biscuits.
- I need this money.

20:18.508 --> 20:21.992
For God's sake, right, you keep the money.

20:22.195 --> 20:24.195
We'll give you what was in the till.

20:24.656 --> 20:26.817
You piss off, end of story.

20:27.625 --> 20:29.945
- And for the biscuits?
- And for the biscuits!

20:30.992 --> 20:32.217
So...

20:32.912 --> 20:34.437
do we have a deal?

20:40.427 --> 20:41.743
Thank you.

20:45.802 --> 20:47.739
No.

20:47.794 --> 20:50.566
- What?
- You can't buy off terrorists.

20:50.591 --> 20:53.121
He'll do it again, some other shopkeeper.

20:53.808 --> 20:56.568
All right.
Here's the boys in blue.

21:06.817 --> 21:08.043
Calm. Calm.

21:11.296 --> 21:12.785
Oh, sorry.

21:14.731 --> 21:17.131
No, no, Jen, don't go in there.
Juan's in there.

21:17.171 --> 21:19.198
Oh, that lock's knackered.

21:19.223 --> 21:21.703
Hey, was he hung like a toreador?

21:21.811 --> 21:24.963
I wouldn't know. He had his body
pressed against Ramona's at the time.

21:24.988 --> 21:27.708
Really?
Oh, lucky old Ramona.

21:27.851 --> 21:29.459
Giving her Juan!

21:29.613 --> 21:31.413
- Eh?
- A hole in Juan!

21:32.046 --> 21:34.022
Guantanamera.

21:34.858 --> 21:36.577
Hey!
Come on!

21:36.646 --> 21:37.862
Let's dance!

22:25.285 --> 22:28.572
I want a plane to fly me to Lloret de Mar.

22:28.709 --> 22:31.338
- We are so dead.
- All right, a train to Brighton then.

22:31.486 --> 22:34.846
But first class, and I'm not to be
charged with nothing.

22:35.011 --> 22:38.771
And if you storm the place, I start
shooting.

22:43.845 --> 22:45.641
Juan seems very nice.

22:47.562 --> 22:49.774
Yeah.
Yeah, I suppose so.

22:56.485 --> 22:58.845
Does Ramona know he's cheating on her?

23:01.722 --> 23:03.178
What makes you think that?

23:04.611 --> 23:06.971
Bathroom door doesn't lock properly, Josh.

23:08.072 --> 23:11.971
Oh, my God.
It's no great surprise, darling.

23:16.197 --> 23:18.571
Well, how long have you known?

23:19.539 --> 23:20.859
Since you were about six.

23:22.411 --> 23:24.011
That's longer than I've known.

23:24.145 --> 23:26.967
Yeah, well, I couldn't be sure, but...

23:28.510 --> 23:31.175
By the time you were a teenager,
I pretty much was.

23:32.150 --> 23:34.876
Your attempt at dating girls
wasn't very convincing, Josh.

23:34.901 --> 23:37.124
- I did try.
- I know you did, darling.

23:38.064 --> 23:41.132
Ellie found a couple of old copies
of Playboy in your room.

23:44.937 --> 23:46.351
Do you mind?

23:47.569 --> 23:49.621
That you never tidied your room?

23:51.251 --> 23:55.051
- I'm just sorry you couldn't tell me, darling.
- I had to admit it to myself first.

23:56.255 --> 23:58.406
Well, you've done that now, haven't you?

24:02.758 --> 24:04.019
I love him, Mum.

24:13.902 --> 24:15.341
Does Dad know?

24:17.709 --> 24:18.909
No.

24:21.933 --> 24:23.571
Could you tell him?

24:24.451 --> 24:25.659
Please.

24:35.703 --> 24:38.811
I bet it's Bob.
He's always in my stuff, the bastard.

24:38.851 --> 24:41.805
He doesn't just nick my bird,
he steals my gear as well.

24:42.321 --> 24:45.117
- I don't want to die.
- We're not going to.

24:45.744 --> 24:47.611
Unless someone does something stupid.

24:47.651 --> 24:49.470
It was only under the mattress.

24:49.823 --> 24:51.823
A couple of weeks ago.

24:52.891 --> 24:54.172
I wanted to...

24:55.771 --> 24:57.069
I thought about it.

25:00.211 --> 25:02.296
I was this close.

25:02.451 --> 25:04.767
That far from the edge.

25:05.891 --> 25:07.524
I nearly jumped, Adam.

25:09.971 --> 25:12.047
Jesus, Pete, why didn't you tell me?

25:12.467 --> 25:15.841
- What would you have done?
- I'd have tried to talk you out of it.

25:16.835 --> 25:19.211
- I suppose that's why I didn't tell you.
- Shut up!

25:19.521 --> 25:20.960
Pete, please.

25:21.420 --> 25:25.092
If you ever think you're going to
feel like that again,

25:25.404 --> 25:29.811
even if I can't help, you owe it to
your family, to me, to at least let me try.

25:30.333 --> 25:32.133
You've got so much to live for.

25:33.170 --> 25:35.073
I know that now.

25:35.423 --> 25:37.912
It's just...
I don't want to die in a mini-mart.

25:37.937 --> 25:39.681
What are you two talking about?

25:44.985 --> 25:47.286
- Where's Adam?
- Oh, I'm not sure.

25:48.317 --> 25:51.918
- Why? Need him for something?
- No. I just haven't seen him for a while.

25:52.054 --> 25:53.809
But you were looking.

25:56.678 --> 25:59.038
You know, he's really fond of you.

25:59.660 --> 26:00.894
I am of him.

26:01.091 --> 26:04.261
No, no, no, I mean he's really fond.

26:04.918 --> 26:07.183
But he can't be relied on, though, can he?

26:07.355 --> 26:09.039
I mean, Angela.

26:09.451 --> 26:12.651
Well, he's quite passionate.
That's true.

26:12.848 --> 26:15.131
But some people would say that was a
good thing.

26:15.887 --> 26:17.087
Hm?

26:19.775 --> 26:23.470
Sean, use the phone,
lad, and keep talking to us.

26:24.452 --> 26:26.212
Shit, get down, get down!

26:29.961 --> 26:31.367
- Give me the phone.
- Piss off!

26:31.392 --> 26:34.398
They are going to kill you.
Now, give me the phone.

26:40.851 --> 26:43.310
Listen... Look...

26:43.903 --> 26:46.615
No. No, no, no.
There's to be no shooting.

26:46.912 --> 26:48.504
- Another one?
- I'm not the gunman.

26:48.529 --> 26:51.489
- No, I'm one of the hostages.
- We thought you were another one.

26:51.514 --> 26:54.834
Is that because of my accent?
God, that's racist.

26:55.051 --> 26:58.418
Listen, we can resolve this peacefully,

26:58.605 --> 27:01.326
as long as everyone calms down.

27:01.512 --> 27:03.122
Just give me a moment.

27:08.804 --> 27:11.611
I have a 15-year-old son waiting for
me.

27:13.351 --> 27:14.954
He's a beautiful boy.

27:15.920 --> 27:17.480
He looks like his mother.

27:18.550 --> 27:20.470
She died when he was a baby.

27:21.971 --> 27:23.343
I'm all he has.

27:24.960 --> 27:26.655
Don't make him an orphan.

27:34.515 --> 27:35.731
Now, give me the gun.

27:35.756 --> 27:37.429
Stand back or I'll shoot!

27:37.481 --> 27:40.681
Give yourself up now,
and we'll put in a good word for you.

27:41.011 --> 27:44.491
We'll say you treated us well, gave us water.
You made us feel comfortable.

27:44.531 --> 27:46.011
I'll shoot you in the leg.

27:46.920 --> 27:49.520
If you hear a shot, take him out.

27:50.467 --> 27:52.397
Now, please,

27:54.048 --> 27:55.808
for my son, Matthew,

27:58.912 --> 28:00.516
give me the gun.

28:04.563 --> 28:05.774
Go on.

28:14.075 --> 28:15.552
I have the gun.

28:19.851 --> 28:21.452
- It's a replica.
- Ugh!

28:22.749 --> 28:24.702
Oh, for fuck's sake.

28:25.913 --> 28:28.083
Armed police!
Get down!

28:28.515 --> 28:29.912
Drop the gun!

28:32.445 --> 28:34.331
- This might be the moment.
- What?

28:34.371 --> 28:38.140
Well, Eddie rang this week, wanting
to know where Mum would be tonight.

28:38.773 --> 28:41.311
- Why?
- I'm sworn to secrecy.

28:42.596 --> 28:45.093
- Well, come on.
- He's going to ask her to marry him.

28:45.118 --> 28:47.318
- What?
- He's got a ring and everything.

28:47.671 --> 28:50.485
- But she ditched him.
- Dumb move, I thought.

28:50.691 --> 28:53.612
You have to hand it to her.
She knows how to play men.

28:54.159 --> 28:56.871
All being well, I'm going to be
stepdaughter to a billionaire.

28:56.895 --> 28:58.306
He's not worth half that.

28:58.573 --> 29:00.302
Besides, she'll say no.

29:00.971 --> 29:03.011
- Won't she?
- I wouldn't.

29:22.449 --> 29:25.186
I'm here at the scene.
The siege appears to be over.

29:25.211 --> 29:27.931
The police are making no comment
at this time.

29:29.279 --> 29:32.079
It's over.
We can go.

29:34.279 --> 29:35.719
I love you, mate.

29:40.851 --> 29:42.234
I love my son.

29:43.211 --> 29:44.531
I love my friends.

29:46.654 --> 29:48.014
And I want Tina.

29:48.594 --> 29:51.309
Well, stop farting about and go and get her.

30:02.987 --> 30:06.147
- Hi.
- Where the hell have you two been?

30:06.858 --> 30:11.100
- You're not going to believe what just happened.
- We've been in a siege. Held up at gunpoint.

30:11.125 --> 30:14.085
Adam talked the gunman round into
giving himself up.

30:16.136 --> 30:17.342
It's true.

30:17.367 --> 30:21.187
So, it's a coincidence it's about 20 past 11,
pub chucking out time?

30:21.707 --> 30:24.824
- Yes!
- Why did you leave the party in the first place?

30:24.849 --> 30:26.489
To buy the booze!

30:28.003 --> 30:30.947
Oh, bollocks.
You'd already paid for it.

30:30.987 --> 30:32.787
- Pathetic.
- What?

30:36.558 --> 30:38.078
Jen, it's true.

30:40.427 --> 30:42.147
Ohh!

30:46.312 --> 30:47.512
Ohh!

30:48.656 --> 30:49.905
High five.

30:53.058 --> 30:56.147
Oi, oi, you, over.
Oi, oi, shove over.

30:56.426 --> 30:58.747
- Two episodes tonight, that's all.
- No!

30:58.787 --> 31:01.667
- You've got school.
- But you'll watch another when I go to bed.

31:01.707 --> 31:04.347
We might have some other things to do
when you go to bed.

31:04.387 --> 31:06.493
Never mention that when I'm around.

31:19.999 --> 31:21.279
Excuse me.

31:22.943 --> 31:25.474
The man has an iron bladder.
I thought he'd never leave us alone.

31:25.498 --> 31:27.749
Got the impression
he felt the same about you.

31:27.774 --> 31:29.122
I've been holding it in.

31:36.309 --> 31:37.668
- Karen...
- David,

31:38.446 --> 31:40.886
what would you think if Josh were gay?

31:42.184 --> 31:44.104
- Why do you ask that?
- Josh is gay.

31:49.100 --> 31:50.440
Is he?

31:51.483 --> 31:53.452
He was worried it might bother you.

31:53.765 --> 31:58.547
Oh, come on, Karen. I went to boarding school.
You know. We all had our moments.

31:58.734 --> 32:00.867
It's a bit more than a moment, David.

32:06.539 --> 32:10.905
Of course, you know, ultimately,
I want him to be happy.

32:11.356 --> 32:12.647
He is happy.

32:16.311 --> 32:19.747
So, you're saying that Ramona is
Juan's beard, is she?

32:20.298 --> 32:21.509
Beard?

32:22.055 --> 32:23.627
It's a word I learnt in prison.

32:23.938 --> 32:25.947
Karen, I want to talk to you
about the future.

32:25.987 --> 32:27.704
Yeah, I was going to say

32:27.729 --> 32:29.996
- if you would like to stay at mine...
- But, Karen.

32:30.020 --> 32:32.354
Until you find something permanent, you can.

32:32.393 --> 32:34.587
- The girls love having you.
- Let's get married!

32:34.627 --> 32:36.387
- What?
- When my divorce is through.

32:36.427 --> 32:38.503
I love you, Karen.
I love us.

32:38.573 --> 32:41.495
We could all live together again.
Like when we were happy.

32:41.534 --> 32:42.787
And...

32:42.827 --> 32:44.464
I really need to pee.

32:46.675 --> 32:48.507
Has David always been so clingy?

32:48.820 --> 32:51.723
Eddie, why are you here?

32:52.827 --> 32:54.627
I've realised I want to be with you.

32:55.567 --> 32:58.646
I'd base myself here,
travel only when business demands,

32:58.671 --> 33:00.351
which wouldn't be often.

33:01.686 --> 33:03.473
You don't believe I'm serious.

33:07.227 --> 33:09.987
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

33:11.529 --> 33:14.558
Oh, my God. That's crazy.
Let me think. Put it away, put it away.

33:16.113 --> 33:19.227
Ah, that's better.
Did I miss anything?

33:27.107 --> 33:28.648
So, what's up with you and Ellie?

33:28.673 --> 33:30.833
Ugh.
She wants to get back together.

33:31.320 --> 33:33.947
Oh.
Does Olivia know?

33:37.187 --> 33:39.305
Oh, I see.

33:39.967 --> 33:41.790
Spoilt for choice, eh?

33:42.731 --> 33:44.651
Well, I'm not going to tell you what to do.

33:44.793 --> 33:47.113
- Oh, I wish you would.
- Yeah?

33:49.261 --> 33:52.429
Don't be swayed by how much they
might seem to want you.

33:52.787 --> 33:55.000
What matters is how much you want them.

33:55.711 --> 33:58.258
- Act on that.
- It's good advice.

34:02.691 --> 34:04.199
You should take it.

34:11.590 --> 34:14.187
Mum!
Have you seen this?

34:14.226 --> 34:15.963
A friend just posted it! It's Dad.

34:15.987 --> 34:17.668
Oh, my God.
See?

34:17.867 --> 34:19.467
I thought you were lying.

34:20.069 --> 34:21.422
You're a hero, Dad.

34:21.447 --> 34:23.562
It was Adam.
All I did was keep out of the way.

34:23.587 --> 34:25.107
- I'm glad you did.
- Ohh!

34:25.147 --> 34:28.587
- I'm gonna show that to Adam.
- Pete, you could have died.

34:29.987 --> 34:32.399
It was the thought of you
that kept me going.

34:33.226 --> 34:34.860
And my son and daughter.

34:36.540 --> 34:38.420
I bloody love you.

34:40.786 --> 34:43.516
I'll tell you one thing about a
near-death experience.

34:43.827 --> 34:45.627
It makes you appreciate life.

34:46.799 --> 34:48.139
No.

34:48.804 --> 34:50.289
It makes you horny.

34:51.797 --> 34:55.277
- Have you been at David's pills, by chance?
- No.

34:55.545 --> 34:58.107
That's all me.
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

35:08.101 --> 35:09.332
Hi, Dad.

35:12.183 --> 35:14.107
Has Mum spoke to you yet?

35:14.334 --> 35:15.837
She has, yes.

35:19.603 --> 35:21.103
- Joshie...
- David.

35:21.923 --> 35:24.500
- Might I have a quick word?
- Eddie.

35:24.993 --> 35:27.258
- Have you met my son, Josh?
- No.

35:27.427 --> 35:28.627
Hi.

35:28.707 --> 35:30.219
And this is his...

35:30.627 --> 35:32.987
Er...
This is Juan.

35:33.337 --> 35:35.637
- His boyfriend.
- Oh.

35:36.802 --> 35:38.028
Hello.

35:39.130 --> 35:40.536
Thank you.

35:45.747 --> 35:49.816
As father of Karen's children,
I suppose you have a right to know.

35:49.907 --> 35:51.558
I've asked her to marry me.

35:51.707 --> 35:53.227
- Really?
- Mm.

35:53.267 --> 35:55.307
And has she accepted your proposal?

35:55.667 --> 35:58.267
She hasn't given me her answer yet, no.

35:58.299 --> 36:02.651
No, well, I expect she'll want to deal with
them in the order in which they were received.

36:07.030 --> 36:08.772
Can I have a word, please?

36:08.987 --> 36:12.707
Oh, hello. I thought you'd gone...
Left your own party.

36:13.147 --> 36:14.987
Yeah, I got held up somewhere.
Um...

36:15.108 --> 36:17.381
I could do with some air.
Do you mind?

36:18.013 --> 36:19.670
Yeah, all right.

36:25.987 --> 36:27.834
Excuse me, boys.
Sorry.

36:28.867 --> 36:32.507
Oh, my God, Ramona.
I've just been proposed to.

36:32.627 --> 36:34.387
- What, by David?
- And Eddie.

36:34.427 --> 36:36.907
- Eddie?
- Yeah, within five minutes of each other.

36:36.947 --> 36:39.307
- Karen, you lied to me.
- What?

36:39.347 --> 36:41.667
Your last email,
you told me your life was boring.

36:41.707 --> 36:44.878
- Well, maybe we should write more often.
- Oh, Karen.

36:45.058 --> 36:48.392
- I was planning on asking her to marry me.
- What's that got to do with it?

36:48.416 --> 36:50.378
You wouldn't have proposed otherwise!

36:51.621 --> 36:53.014
Withdraw your offer.

36:53.260 --> 36:57.115
- What? Why?
- Because it's insincere, David.

36:57.303 --> 37:00.176
It's like when two firms
are discussing a merger

37:00.201 --> 37:03.707
and a third party launches a takeover bid
just to scupper the deal!

37:03.747 --> 37:07.676
- You see everything in terms of business.
- Your proposal was fraudulent!

37:09.308 --> 37:12.082
- You see Karen as an asset.
- You know all about fraud.

37:12.107 --> 37:14.467
Are they wrestling or playing Twister?

37:18.470 --> 37:20.350
David!
Bite him, David!

37:20.707 --> 37:24.107
Bite him!
Bite his balls, come on!

37:24.623 --> 37:25.947
Stop it!

37:29.341 --> 37:31.221
For goodness' sake.

37:32.183 --> 37:35.956
Have either of you stopped for a moment
to consider what I actually want?

37:37.027 --> 37:39.067
I've finally got a life I actually like.

37:39.494 --> 37:41.229
I intend to keep it.

37:42.041 --> 37:44.119
I don't want to marry either of you.

37:50.910 --> 37:53.747
You've turned it on.
No, not me!

37:53.855 --> 37:55.995
- The tap.
- Come on, get up. Higher.

37:56.020 --> 37:57.660
There, that's it.
Ohh.

37:59.867 --> 38:01.931
Erm, I'm the queue.

38:07.187 --> 38:10.903
Er, Matthew and me, we've loved living here.

38:11.051 --> 38:12.947
I've loved having you.

38:12.987 --> 38:16.347
I was thinking...
We don't need to leave.

38:16.558 --> 38:21.358
I could rent out my new house and stay here
and be just across the hall from you.

38:22.907 --> 38:26.787
I mean, I don't know what Jamie would
think about it. How's he settling in?

38:27.370 --> 38:29.107
Yeah, fine.

38:29.303 --> 38:30.583
Mm-hm.

38:31.925 --> 38:35.190
He eats white bread.
He listens to The Archers.

38:35.456 --> 38:38.141
He squeezes the toothpaste out of
the middle of the tube.

38:38.166 --> 38:41.457
- Oh, teething troubles, eh?
- Oh, it's not his fault, Adam.

38:42.267 --> 38:45.688
- I never asked him to move in.
- You haven't asked him to move out.

38:50.257 --> 38:53.966
I'm responsible for the breakdown of his
marriage. I owe it to him to give it a go.

38:53.991 --> 38:58.028
But are you, though, giving it another go?
Or are you just waiting for it to fail?

38:58.053 --> 39:01.227
Because it will. Not because it's him,
although it's reason enough,

39:01.306 --> 39:02.736
but because you

39:02.933 --> 39:06.838
don't want to find anyone
that might compare to Liam.

39:08.940 --> 39:10.780
It's because I know I can't.

39:13.531 --> 39:15.293
Rachel was the love of my life.

39:16.823 --> 39:18.621
Like Liam's yours.

39:20.097 --> 39:22.177
It doesn't mean they have to be the last.

39:26.898 --> 39:28.341
Wait a minute.

39:34.520 --> 39:36.387
- Is that Jamie's?
- Yeah.

39:36.427 --> 39:39.114
He brought it to the party.
What a wanker.

40:32.254 --> 40:33.987
You do know that's your guitar.

40:44.107 --> 40:45.347
Let's go inside.

40:48.218 --> 40:51.152
- Think about what I said.
- I think you've said enough, all right?

40:51.176 --> 40:54.621
Yeah, he's right, Adam.
You've said enough.

41:22.227 --> 41:24.930
It might be better
if I move out of the house.

41:26.227 --> 41:30.265
- Find somewhere of my own.
- You don't have to do that on my account.

41:30.370 --> 41:31.570
No.

41:32.736 --> 41:34.110
But on mine.

42:08.888 --> 42:10.132
Hi, Dad.

42:12.787 --> 42:14.867
- Are you all right?
- No, I'm fine, son.

42:15.547 --> 42:16.795
Hello, Olivia.

42:19.576 --> 42:20.849
Don't mind me.

42:23.021 --> 42:24.267
Adam?

42:24.803 --> 42:26.717
- We're going to shoot off.
- Ah.

42:27.756 --> 42:29.348
Mm!
Did you have a nice time?

42:30.168 --> 42:31.418
Very nice.

42:34.316 --> 42:36.636
Adam, I was wondering...

42:36.933 --> 42:39.580
Might you need a lodger in your new home?

42:41.387 --> 42:44.698
Erm... Well, I thought we might be
staying on here,

42:44.723 --> 42:47.262
but now I'm not sure what we're doing.

42:47.777 --> 42:50.067
Er... Matt, would you be all right
with that?

42:50.121 --> 42:52.098
You know, see how it goes?

42:52.152 --> 42:53.352
Sure.

42:53.427 --> 42:56.890
Excellent. You, me and Matt.
Three amigos.

42:56.981 --> 43:00.223
- Oi.
- Oh, David! I'm so excited.

43:00.310 --> 43:01.911
David, David, David.

43:03.364 --> 43:05.038
Karen, she offered me a job.

43:05.116 --> 43:08.991
- I am going to be her new PA.
- Mm-hm.

43:09.647 --> 43:11.707
Isn't fluent English a prerequisite?

43:11.866 --> 43:14.780
- A pre-what?
- It's on a trial basis.

43:15.170 --> 43:17.506
- Hiya.
- Oh, hello.

43:17.627 --> 43:19.427
The party's breaking up.

43:19.842 --> 43:21.842
Yeah, I should go down. Erm...

43:22.404 --> 43:23.723
Er...

43:25.526 --> 43:27.740
Actually, all my friends are here.

43:29.507 --> 43:31.692
It's all my friends that are leaving.

43:32.872 --> 43:34.161
Jamie, too.

43:39.778 --> 43:41.947
You stay living across the hall, yeah?

43:44.992 --> 43:46.580
And we'll see how it goes.

43:50.364 --> 43:51.830
One day at a time.

44:01.768 --> 44:03.316
Best 50th ever.
