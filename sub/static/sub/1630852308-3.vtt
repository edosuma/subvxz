00:27.190 --> 00:29.170
Hello?

00:29.210 --> 00:31.130
Yes, I'm sorry.

00:33.040 --> 00:36.040
I'm sorry. I'm just around the corner.

00:42.020 --> 00:43.150
Hello?

00:46.050 --> 00:47.180
Look out!

00:52.100 --> 00:54.130
Are you all right?

00:58.050 --> 01:00.010
Are you ok?

01:02.100 --> 01:05.210
-Should I call an ambulance?
-No, it's fine.

01:47.110 --> 01:49.120
Tore Hund.

02:08.220 --> 02:12.120
I really don't understand.
Excuse me.

03:37.070 --> 03:39.000
Go to hell!

03:40.130 --> 03:43.060
Please don't contaminate my lab.

03:43.100 --> 03:47.060
-Sorry. Old habit.
-You found something important?

03:47.100 --> 03:53.130
When you sent me the video of the woman,
I re-examined the autopsy results.

03:53.170 --> 03:58.050
-Ok, and..?
-Our intern made a number of mistakes.

03:58.090 --> 04:02.170
Intern? Why was
an intern handling this case?

04:04.010 --> 04:10.080
We're hardly alone in making unorthodox
priorities due to lack of resources.

04:11.240 --> 04:16.050
Ok. Can you confirm that she arrived
earlier than first presumed?

04:16.090 --> 04:19.220
Yes, and not just that.
I found this inside her.

04:20.010 --> 04:23.040
Our intern thought this was a cyst.

04:28.070 --> 04:34.120
-Maybe she swallowed it in the water?
-This was encapsulated in the tissue.

04:34.160 --> 04:39.010
It's been there for 20 years.
She must have swallowed it as a child.

04:39.050 --> 04:42.050
-So she isn't a Prehistorian?
-No.

04:42.090 --> 04:47.180
Despite her efforts to give a
different impression, she's of our time.

04:49.050 --> 04:53.240
What kind of present day woman
would pose as a Stone Age person?

04:56.200 --> 05:00.130
Ever since I was a boy,
I knew I was different.

05:01.210 --> 05:06.060
While the others were playing
on computers and PlayStation,

05:06.100 --> 05:09.100
I was in the garden, watching birds.

05:09.140 --> 05:15.100
It wasn't until I went to
the Stone Age workshop that it clicked.

05:16.120 --> 05:19.070
You're living a lie, they told me.

05:19.110 --> 05:26.000
You're not Trond the tax auditor.
You are Tuk-Tuk the hunter.

05:26.040 --> 05:29.010
-Welcome to us, Tuk-Tuk.
-Thank you!

05:29.050 --> 05:32.070
BORN IN THE WRONG MILLENNIUM?

05:42.050 --> 05:45.170
Please leave
your phones and computers here.

05:45.210 --> 05:49.150
Many people here
are sensitive to electricity.

05:49.190 --> 05:51.060
Ok...

05:53.200 --> 05:56.000
Good.

05:56.040 --> 06:00.240
Let's see. Right. Please.

06:05.000 --> 06:06.080
Now...

06:07.160 --> 06:09.120
We're investigating a homicide

06:09.160 --> 06:14.150
where we suspect the victim has ties
to the trans-temporal community.

06:14.190 --> 06:18.240
-How horrendous.
-Have you seen this woman before?

06:20.050 --> 06:22.170
I need my glasses.

06:22.210 --> 06:26.210
My eyes are not accustomed
to the color photographs.

06:30.130 --> 06:32.010
No.

06:33.160 --> 06:37.090
I don't recognize her.
Is her trans-temporality confirmed?

06:37.130 --> 06:40.120
We're awaiting results,
but we're quite sure.

06:40.160 --> 06:46.060
In that case she's done a fantastic job
on her transformation.

06:47.210 --> 06:51.110
How many people are
part of the trans-temporal community?

06:51.150 --> 06:53.210
In this center about 250...

07:22.030 --> 07:25.040
Before dealing with the news
from the pathologist,

07:25.080 --> 07:29.210
we have another pressing matter. Jørn,
things are happening at the Mermaid?

07:30.000 --> 07:33.100
Yes, I have been tailing the guy
who runs the club.

07:33.140 --> 07:38.010
I was hoping Holger Caspersen
could lead us to persons of interest.

07:38.050 --> 07:43.230
But I'm concerned about the flight risk.
This footage was captured this morning.

07:44.020 --> 07:47.100
-Is that diving equipment?
-Yes, among other things.

07:47.140 --> 07:49.050
Some of it may be weapons.

07:49.090 --> 07:53.010
Good job, Jørn.
What do you say, Lars?

07:53.050 --> 07:56.150
I agree with Jørn.
We can't wait any longer.

08:03.030 --> 08:07.070
-Is this your first armed assignment?
-My debut, yes.

08:14.050 --> 08:16.230
There's a manual if you need info...

08:17.020 --> 08:20.210
Relax. I've been trained
in weapons handling.

08:21.000 --> 08:24.170
-I know how a revolver works.
-That's a pistol.

08:37.240 --> 08:43.120
Don't take all of it! Do you think
I plan to transcend in a sober state?

08:43.160 --> 08:47.170
Is it madness,
what we're doing here, my friend?

08:52.190 --> 08:56.050
To paraphrase the Roman slave
whose thoughts were free:

08:56.090 --> 09:00.120
There is no genius
without a touch of madness.

09:06.040 --> 09:09.040
Welcome to my "rite de passage".

09:18.140 --> 09:23.020
In a Greek tavern I have recited
iambs and trochees with Lord Byron.

09:23.060 --> 09:25.040
In the strobe lights of The Villa

09:25.080 --> 09:30.050
I have danced the sneakers off
Justin Bieber and his troupe.

09:30.090 --> 09:33.230
I have embraced
both of my time periods with passion.

09:34.020 --> 09:37.150
Alas, this century
did not return my love.

09:37.190 --> 09:42.110
I have thus decided, under
the guidance of Karl Otto Morgenstierne,

09:42.150 --> 09:45.090
to return to my time of origin.

09:45.130 --> 09:49.060
Karl Otto, do we have time
for my chanson d'adieu?

09:49.100 --> 09:55.050
According to my calculations, a flash
will occur at the islet in a moment.

10:07.100 --> 10:09.000
Farewell.

10:29.050 --> 10:31.050
Police! Stay where you are!

10:37.160 --> 10:44.020
You may start by telling us what you
know about the Tjuvholmen murder.

10:44.060 --> 10:48.060
I was meant to be in Christiania
this evening. Not here.

10:48.100 --> 10:51.230
What you planned to do today
is hopeless.

10:52.020 --> 10:57.070
Listen. Everybody knows
it's impossible to go back in time.

10:57.110 --> 10:59.140
Alfhildr...

10:59.180 --> 11:03.170
Listen. This woman was murdered.

11:03.210 --> 11:08.080
We believe someone
in your circle was behind it.

11:08.120 --> 11:11.240
I want you to tell me
everything you know.

11:12.030 --> 11:17.080
Under no circumstances...

11:17.120 --> 11:20.020
...can I give you Navn (Name).

11:20.060 --> 11:23.050
Damn straight you're giving us a name!

11:25.240 --> 11:30.240
-He'll crush me.
-Him? Is Navn a person?

11:35.150 --> 11:39.020
Hello? Is Navn a person?

11:40.130 --> 11:41.220
Hello?

11:53.170 --> 11:58.040
What about the stuff he said about Navn?
Was that just nonsense?

11:58.080 --> 12:00.230
I'll find out.

12:01.020 --> 12:03.020
-Your weapon.
-What?

12:03.060 --> 12:07.080
-Put it back in the cabinet.
-Yeah! Of course!

12:07.120 --> 12:10.120
-I was going to put it back.
-Sure.

12:17.160 --> 12:19.110
-Shit!
-What are you doing?

12:19.150 --> 12:23.080
-Nothing! It just went off!
-Put it down right now!

12:23.120 --> 12:25.070
Is everyone all right?

12:30.120 --> 12:31.200
Oh, no!

12:33.130 --> 12:35.220
It's probably just a small tear.

12:40.220 --> 12:46.230
Wenche, take the weapon and bullet
to technical. We need to report it.

12:47.020 --> 12:51.010
I told you giving the Viking
a license was a bad idea.

13:44.210 --> 13:46.190
That's my workout for the day.

13:54.100 --> 13:58.000
Hey, I'm sort of new at this.

13:59.040 --> 14:01.070
How bad is that chemo stuff?

14:05.030 --> 14:09.130
Look. This was taken
the day before I started treatment.

14:11.100 --> 14:13.240
About five weeks ago.

14:14.030 --> 14:15.150
This is me.

14:25.240 --> 14:28.120
Urd Sighvatsdottir?

14:28.160 --> 14:29.240
Urd?

14:40.130 --> 14:43.140
I'll go straight for the jug today.

15:04.140 --> 15:07.180
Long time, no see.

15:07.220 --> 15:09.170
Who are you again?

15:11.130 --> 15:15.150
Don't be like that.
Was it that bad last time?

15:19.130 --> 15:22.230
Ok, maybe it wasn't my best night.

15:23.020 --> 15:27.060
But trust me, I can do better.

15:27.100 --> 15:31.110
Good to know. For the sake
of the other girls, I mean.

15:33.220 --> 15:35.070
Wait!

15:38.110 --> 15:42.130
You won't believe
who I ran into at the urinal yesterday.

16:02.010 --> 16:07.160
-I thought you said "a few stitches"?
-It got a splint of the shinbone, too.

16:11.070 --> 16:14.060
What kind of cop shoots her colleague?

16:31.080 --> 16:32.160
Shit!

16:35.180 --> 16:39.020
-Whose is it?
-Dad.

16:41.070 --> 16:44.150
Hey, let's bring one
for the next bus party.

16:44.190 --> 16:46.150
Don't be silly.

16:50.180 --> 16:54.070
There. OK. Thank you. It's OK.

16:56.050 --> 16:57.130
Hi.

16:59.020 --> 17:01.210
-Come on in.
-What happened?

17:03.000 --> 17:06.070
-I was shot in the leg.
-Jesus Christ!

17:06.110 --> 17:08.160
-Who shot you?
-It was me.

17:08.200 --> 17:10.060
-Alfhildr.
-Ingrid.

17:10.100 --> 17:13.100
She's my new partner.

17:13.140 --> 17:17.070
It was an accident, but I'm afraid
it's not looking good for dinner.

17:17.110 --> 17:21.070
-I can make dinner.
-No, you've done enough damage.

17:21.110 --> 17:24.110
Don't deny me this.
It's part of my culture.

17:24.150 --> 17:29.020
Norse people always make food
for someone we've just shot.

17:37.170 --> 17:40.040
Lars told me
you're graduating next year.

17:40.080 --> 17:43.130
Yeah, it will be cool.

17:44.160 --> 17:48.070
I'm kind of jealous.
That's the life, isn't it?

17:48.110 --> 17:52.170
Bumming around in a car for months,
just dancing, drinking and shagging.

17:52.210 --> 17:54.200
Hey...

17:54.240 --> 17:59.040
Maybe not exactly
how you should talk to teenage girls?

18:01.080 --> 18:03.060
I can't see any girls here.

18:03.100 --> 18:08.130
All I see is three vigorous women
and a sourpuss with a limp.

18:08.170 --> 18:11.040
-Do you see any girls?
-No.

18:11.080 --> 18:13.180
I don't see any girls at all, Lars.

18:20.020 --> 18:25.020
I asked on some beforeigner forums
if anyone knew a person named Navn.

18:25.060 --> 18:27.090
Did you find anything?

18:27.130 --> 18:30.240
One of them
had been at a reception center

18:31.030 --> 18:34.080
who listed newcomers
as Navn Ukjent (Name Unknown).

18:34.120 --> 18:39.040
Most changed their name later.
But some got used to the name,

18:39.080 --> 18:41.210
and had it approved by the state.

18:42.000 --> 18:46.090
-So they're registered as Navn Ukjent?
-Apparently so.

18:46.130 --> 18:51.090
I asked IT to find everyone
called Navn Ukjent in Oslo.

18:51.130 --> 18:53.090
Good.

18:53.130 --> 18:55.240
Hey, I have a personal question.

18:56.030 --> 18:58.090
Sure, go on.

18:58.130 --> 19:03.120
What is the Service's view
on sexual relations among colleagues?

19:04.230 --> 19:07.080
Where are you going with this?

19:08.200 --> 19:14.160
Relax, Haaland!
I'm not trying to get in your pants.

19:14.200 --> 19:16.070
Oh!

19:18.070 --> 19:22.240
The thing is I've been
messaging with that harbor cop.

19:23.030 --> 19:27.030
-Messaging?
-You know, MS-es.

19:27.070 --> 19:31.090
He sends a photo of his rod,
I answer with a shot of my cooter.

19:33.030 --> 19:35.150
Don't send photos
like that to strangers.

19:35.190 --> 19:41.060
If some morons want to have a good time
with my cooter shots, I don't care.

19:44.140 --> 19:48.110
Well, that's a generous attitude.

19:48.150 --> 19:49.230
What do you think?

19:50.020 --> 19:54.170
Will I get in trouble with the Service
if I take this to the next level?

19:54.210 --> 19:59.000
It wouldn't be considered
a breach of code as such.

20:00.080 --> 20:03.090
But you're skeptical to the idea?

20:05.150 --> 20:08.000
No, why would I be? No...

20:14.100 --> 20:15.220
Hello?

20:21.060 --> 20:23.020
Do you two have a thing?

20:23.060 --> 20:26.010
-No...
-So why are you blushing?

20:27.160 --> 20:31.100
-I have to split.
-Thanks for dinner.

20:31.140 --> 20:33.050
Thank you.

20:35.110 --> 20:37.120
Sorry again for that.

20:38.190 --> 20:41.030
-Bye.
-Bye.

20:47.070 --> 20:50.220
Pretty similar. I'll give you that.

20:51.010 --> 20:53.190
Skjalg was convinced it was him.

20:55.120 --> 20:57.170
If Tore Hund was here,

20:57.210 --> 21:02.200
do you really think he'd be working
as a fucking Foodie delivery guy?

21:02.240 --> 21:08.100
There's only one way to find out.
I guggled his address.

21:08.140 --> 21:11.240
-It's not him, Urd.
-Very well, then.

21:12.030 --> 21:16.180
I'll just go by myself. You can be
the flower girl at our wedding.

21:40.050 --> 21:43.010
Is that supposed to be his girlfriend?

21:44.040 --> 21:47.140
At least we know it's not Tore.

21:47.180 --> 21:51.030
He'd never go for
a droopy butt like that.

21:51.070 --> 21:54.170
Come on. We have to make sure.

21:54.210 --> 21:57.020
Bye, dad!

22:13.080 --> 22:14.160
Hi.

22:16.060 --> 22:18.040
31.90.

22:18.080 --> 22:22.010
I have one of those diaper cards.
This one is free.

22:22.050 --> 22:26.180
We've switched owners,
so that's not valid anymore.

22:26.220 --> 22:30.160
Don't be ridiculous.
I've stamped on it for weeks.

22:32.100 --> 22:35.050
Sorry. Next.

23:22.130 --> 23:23.240
Here you go.

23:27.220 --> 23:29.090
Thank you.

23:30.160 --> 23:31.240
Who are you?

23:36.070 --> 23:39.050
You can't have forgotten us?

23:39.090 --> 23:41.120
Sorry, I don't understand.

23:42.140 --> 23:46.130
I lost my language as well
as my memory when I wandered.

23:46.170 --> 23:50.170
-What do you want?
-We're just two Norse women

23:50.210 --> 23:54.080
who saw an old acquaintance
and wanted to chat.

23:54.120 --> 23:58.050
If you're from that society,
I'm not interested.

23:58.090 --> 24:02.220
We're not from
some fucking Ásatrú society.

24:03.010 --> 24:05.000
We're your shieldmaidens, Tore!

24:06.080 --> 24:10.080
-My name is Tommy.
-No, you're Tore Hund.

24:11.090 --> 24:15.030
Leader of the peasant army,
Destroyer of Olaf the Stout.

24:15.070 --> 24:19.010
-Who are those women?
-Come on, this won't work.

24:19.050 --> 24:21.150
Who are they?
Who are they, Tommy?

24:21.190 --> 24:25.140
-I don't know. It's a misunderstanding.
-No, it's not.

24:25.180 --> 24:27.140
Who are they, Tommy?

24:31.090 --> 24:36.170
-Should I call the police?
-That won't be necessary. We're leaving.

24:51.190 --> 24:55.010
-Calm down!
-This place ruins everything.

24:55.050 --> 25:00.040
-Do you remember how great he once was?
-It was a lot to take in.

25:00.080 --> 25:02.150
We have to give him time.

25:04.240 --> 25:07.040
Yes, if only there was time.

25:11.060 --> 25:13.150
Why are you talking like that?

25:20.140 --> 25:22.040
What the fuck?

25:25.080 --> 25:27.030
You have cancer?

25:27.070 --> 25:30.100
I guess that's what
they call that shit here.

25:40.150 --> 25:44.180
-But you're getting treatment?
-I couldn't deal with it.

25:49.050 --> 25:54.000
You have to treat cancer,
or you'll die.

25:54.040 --> 25:55.240
That might be just as well.

26:08.040 --> 26:09.130
Stop it.

26:11.000 --> 26:12.170
We're shieldmaidens.

26:14.060 --> 26:17.120
We were put on this earth to fight.

26:17.160 --> 26:23.220
It doesn't matter if the battlefield is
a Bjarmaland marsh or a hospital bench.

26:26.230 --> 26:32.070
-We fight until the end.
-I said I can't deal with it.

26:33.170 --> 26:36.120
No one can go to war alone.

26:38.140 --> 26:40.210
Next time I'll come with you.

26:42.110 --> 26:44.190
OK, shieldmaiden?

27:02.100 --> 27:06.060
I can live with you shooting Haaland.
But the coffee maker?

27:06.100 --> 27:10.060
Next time I'll make sure
the whole bullet hits Haaland.

27:10.100 --> 27:15.040
-Why is she here today?
-Tech thinks the gun malfunctioned,

27:15.080 --> 27:17.100
so she's on regular service.

27:17.140 --> 27:22.010
I'm responsible for employee security.
We can't let a clearly incompetent...

27:22.050 --> 27:26.030
-Watch your mouth!
-Or what? You'll shoot me, too?

27:30.160 --> 27:35.240
Seven people in Oslo are registered as
Navn Ukjent. Mostly welfare recipients.

27:36.030 --> 27:39.080
But one of them
is a wealthy Prehistorian.

27:40.150 --> 27:44.190
Apart from a few fines for urinating,
his record is clean.

27:44.230 --> 27:49.050
He lives with his wife
in a huge house in Holmenkollåsen.

27:49.090 --> 27:55.000
His tax returns give few clear answers
to where his money comes from.

27:56.150 --> 27:59.060
-Is that Gedi Suleyman?
-Yes.

27:59.100 --> 28:03.230
CM has done a few private
security jobs for Navn and his wife.

28:07.070 --> 28:10.060
SUCCESSFUL BEFOREIGNERS

28:15.180 --> 28:19.040
HERE LIVES IDA CHARLOTTE J. UNKNOWN
AND NAME UNKNOWN

28:23.010 --> 28:28.120
We're from Oslo police department.
Do you have time for a quick chat?

28:41.190 --> 28:46.110
Right... We can wait if you want to...

28:46.150 --> 28:52.220
I have busy-ness, so if it doesn't
offend miss lady, let's to it-get.

28:53.010 --> 28:55.020
Thanks. That's fine.

28:55.060 --> 28:57.070
What do you will?

28:57.110 --> 29:00.210
We're interested in your connection

29:01.000 --> 29:06.050
to a private security firm
called CM Security.

29:06.090 --> 29:11.100
Then this is short-talk.
I have no annection to that firm.

29:11.140 --> 29:15.130
We found photos on your wife's blog
of an event in this house

29:15.170 --> 29:18.030
where CM handled the security.

29:18.070 --> 29:23.120
Maybe so.
My wife flies with many winds.

29:25.080 --> 29:30.150
Two individuals from CM
were recently arrested

29:30.190 --> 29:34.000
on the charge of kidnapping.

29:34.040 --> 29:37.120
Gedi Suleyman and Vind Bjørnsen.

29:39.100 --> 29:41.240
You deny any connection to them?

29:45.070 --> 29:46.190
Yes.

29:50.100 --> 29:55.230
When you've worked as a cop for a while,
you develop what we call intuition.

29:56.020 --> 30:00.240
I'm sure you're familiar with it,
living in harmony with nature.

30:01.030 --> 30:05.010
Do you know what my intuition
is telling me right now?

30:06.040 --> 30:07.180
That you're lying.

30:07.220 --> 30:12.060
I'll give you one last chance
to state your role in the company.

30:19.050 --> 30:20.230
My answer is solid.

31:18.240 --> 31:20.160
Who are you?

31:20.200 --> 31:23.160
I knew the woman
your people fished out of the sea.

31:23.200 --> 31:28.100
We have a mutual interest
in exchanging information.

31:28.140 --> 31:32.200
-Shy away from my grass, female.
-Listen to me...

31:40.100 --> 31:45.230
Nobody comes to the Navn house
and commands what words his ears hear.

31:51.140 --> 31:54.180
This jungle is not as simple as yours.

31:54.220 --> 31:58.030
-I'm just asking for a conversation.
-Navn?

31:59.080 --> 32:02.050
I'll suggest a safer meeting place.

32:05.000 --> 32:06.100
Navn?

32:07.170 --> 32:10.070
Can you look at some carpet samples?

32:25.160 --> 32:29.010
-I think we'll have to take the tram.
-I can drive.

32:29.050 --> 32:31.030
You?

32:31.070 --> 32:34.080
I've been practizing with Gregers
in the Tesla.

32:34.120 --> 32:36.150
-You have?
-Yeah.

32:41.080 --> 32:44.060
What are you going to say
at the family council?

32:44.100 --> 32:50.000
You realize my entire graduation
goes to shit if you don't back me up?

32:50.040 --> 32:52.070
Let's focus on the driving.

32:53.080 --> 32:57.120
Do you mind going in first?
I have to make a quick phone call.

33:17.170 --> 33:22.010
Hi. Sorry I'm late.
I'm not quite used to this thing yet.

33:22.050 --> 33:23.220
-What happened?
-Dad was shot.

33:24.010 --> 33:25.120
-What?
-Shot?

33:25.160 --> 33:30.090
It was just an accident.
We're not here to talk about me, are we?

33:30.130 --> 33:33.130
Here's a footrest for you.

33:33.170 --> 33:36.110
-Is that alright?
-Yes, thanks. Lovely.

33:36.150 --> 33:40.130
The background for this session

33:40.170 --> 33:45.110
is disagreement about
Ingrid's graduation celebration.

33:45.150 --> 33:51.090
Yes, and the fact that Lars undermined
my parental authority, grossly.

33:51.130 --> 33:58.000
Our experience is that it's useful to
speak to, not about, other participants.

33:59.200 --> 34:02.190
Lars, what do you think
about what Marie just said?

34:02.230 --> 34:08.080
I'm here because I think Ingrid deserves
a normal graduation celebration,

34:08.120 --> 34:11.030
although she might have
an unusual family.

34:11.070 --> 34:13.150
Make him stop
provoking me like that.

34:13.190 --> 34:19.020
Marie? Do you remember miss Hjorth's
tip for how to address each other?

34:20.120 --> 34:23.220
OK, I apologize.

34:24.010 --> 34:27.100
It just feels like Lars
doesn't care at all anymore.

34:27.140 --> 34:31.080
He did come here despite
having just been shot.

34:31.120 --> 34:35.140
Isn't that a pretty clear sign
that he cares?

34:35.180 --> 34:38.000
Sure, or...

34:38.040 --> 34:42.230
I'm just worried
you're about to form a skewed picture.

34:43.020 --> 34:47.150
Thanks for the input, but I trust
my ability to form a judgment.

34:47.190 --> 34:51.130
I want to hear from Lars and Ingrid.

34:51.170 --> 34:55.070
What are your thoughts
on this situation?

34:55.110 --> 34:57.000
Yes, maybe I can...

34:57.040 --> 35:01.040
We think the russ celebration
is a part of the culture.

35:05.040 --> 35:10.210
-This didn't make me feel much wiser.
-I found it surprisingly enlightening.

35:11.000 --> 35:13.100
I actually agree with Lars.

35:14.170 --> 35:17.030
-Really?
-One just has to marvel

35:17.070 --> 35:22.200
at modern therapy's ability to make one
confront one's own archaic opinions.

35:22.240 --> 35:27.070
-Have you changed your mind?
-Ms Hjort made me realize

35:27.110 --> 35:31.210
that I may have been
too paternalistic your rite of passage.

35:32.000 --> 35:37.100
Are we really well served to put so much
emphasis on that woman's opinions?

35:37.140 --> 35:40.010
She's very highly respected
in the field.

35:41.190 --> 35:44.160
I suggest we pop by Grand.

36:02.050 --> 36:03.170
Hi.

36:04.230 --> 36:07.110
Relax. I won't freak out again.

36:07.150 --> 36:11.120
-All I'm asking is to chat, Tore.
-Stop calling me that!

36:11.160 --> 36:13.130
I guggled that guy.

36:13.170 --> 36:18.130
Even if I don't remember,
I know I'm no commander.

36:18.170 --> 36:21.220
Then how did you get
that scar on your back?

36:28.210 --> 36:32.130
-I can't deal with this right now.
-Please try to remember.

36:32.170 --> 36:35.220
There was a world better than this one.

36:36.010 --> 36:39.210
Alright. But that world
does not exist anymore.

36:55.210 --> 36:58.240
You have to come.
Tore is in trouble.

37:00.050 --> 37:02.150
-Foodie, this is Trine.
-Hi...

37:02.190 --> 37:04.230
I'm calling from Oslo police department.

37:05.020 --> 37:07.090
I need information
about one of your employees.

37:07.130 --> 37:10.080
I wasn't the one who led them to him.

37:10.120 --> 37:14.000
Skjalg must have
shot his mouth off again.

37:26.120 --> 37:27.200
Hello?

37:29.150 --> 37:33.040
Hello? Did anyone order pizza?

37:35.120 --> 37:37.040
Down here.

37:52.180 --> 37:54.010
Hello?

37:57.070 --> 37:58.150
Hello?

38:13.000 --> 38:16.190
I don't understand.
Who are you?

38:16.230 --> 38:19.170
Has the man lost his mind?

38:19.210 --> 38:23.170
He's probably just got
some memory problems.

38:23.210 --> 38:26.000
We are Olaf the Stout's men.

38:27.010 --> 38:29.230
Nice to see you again, Tore Hund.

38:31.020 --> 38:33.000
Please...

38:33.040 --> 38:35.240
I'm a family man from Romsås.

38:36.030 --> 38:39.230
-I don't remember that stuff.
-Blood shall be repaid by blood.

38:40.020 --> 38:44.100
It doesn't matter
if the blood remembers or not.

38:44.140 --> 38:46.210
Don't do it!

38:47.000 --> 38:48.170
Don't do it...

38:49.190 --> 38:52.210
I have a sick daughter who needs me.

38:53.000 --> 38:54.100
Don't do it.

38:54.140 --> 38:57.190
I have a sick daughter who needs me.

38:59.230 --> 39:01.070
Don't do it!

39:01.110 --> 39:04.110
He's making me
feel sick with his whining.

39:04.150 --> 39:07.160
Can we finish this
with the car instead?

39:45.000 --> 39:48.090
Death to White Christ!

39:58.130 --> 40:01.030
Are you sure this is the right address?

40:08.010 --> 40:09.090
Hello?

40:13.240 --> 40:17.050
Damn... Do you think they got him?

40:47.000 --> 40:49.120
Tell me more of this Tore Hund.

41:25.100 --> 41:29.100
Every cloud has a silver lining,
isn't that what they say?

41:40.130 --> 41:42.100
Looks like we have visitors.

41:42.140 --> 41:48.090
Dirko's story was so peculiar
that I thought you had to hear it.

41:49.100 --> 41:50.200
It's her.

41:51.230 --> 41:54.140
-Where did you meet the victim?
-At "Le temps perdu".

41:54.180 --> 41:58.150
-What is that?
-My styling studio.

41:58.190 --> 42:01.230
We help transtemps appear
from the time they feel like.

42:02.020 --> 42:05.120
And the woman
was a guest in this studio?

42:05.160 --> 42:10.060
-Yes, a ten of calendar sheets ago.
-Did she give a name?

42:10.100 --> 42:15.020
No, she hardly spoke. She brought a note
explaining what we should do.

42:15.060 --> 42:20.190
-What was that, tattoos and stuff?
-Yes, and the cleansing package.

42:20.230 --> 42:24.040
-Cleansing package?
-We remove everything from the present.

42:24.080 --> 42:27.140
Hair color, tooth fillings.

42:27.180 --> 42:30.110
Are you licensed to do dental work?

42:30.150 --> 42:33.090
Could that be a problem
for Le temps perdu?

42:33.130 --> 42:34.210
No.

42:36.100 --> 42:40.030
Can you think of anything else?
Anything could mean something.

42:40.070 --> 42:45.120
A guy who called and pried
about the lady some days later.

42:45.160 --> 42:49.030
-Oh?
-He asked questions about her.

42:50.160 --> 42:52.150
Did he give a name?

42:52.190 --> 42:55.210
From his accent,
he seemed like a Prehistorian.

42:56.000 --> 42:59.020
He called himself Navn or something.
