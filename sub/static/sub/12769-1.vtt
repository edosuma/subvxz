08:30.250 --> 08:32.709
THE FATHER
LEFT HIM IN THE CAR,

08:32.750 --> 08:34.542

BUT IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS,

08:54.083 --> 08:56.792
WE'D BE HAPPY

08:56.834 --> 08:58.625
WHAT DO THESE TUBES DO?

09:01.166 --> 09:03.333

09:28.083 --> 09:32.041
HEY, HE'S A LITTLE SLOW,
BUT HE'S ALL RIGHT.

09:32.083 --> 09:34.709
HE CAN DRESS HIMSELF.
HE GOES TO THE STORE.

09:34.750 --> 09:36.792
HE HAS FRIENDS.
WHERE DOES HE LIVE?

09:36.834 --> 09:39.000
IN A KIND OF, UH,
GROUP HOME OR SOMETHING.

09:39.041 --> 09:41.375
BUT YOU'RE NOT SURE.
LOOK, I PAY FOR IT.

09:41.417 --> 09:43.041
YOU KNOW, HE'S HAPPY

09:43.083 --> 09:46.041
LIVING WITH OTHER PEOPLE
JUST LIKE HIM, OKAY?

09:46.083 --> 09:48.083
I DON'T SEE HIM THAT OFTEN.
WELL, GIVEN HIS MENTAL STATE,

09:48.125 --> 09:50.041

WHY YOU HAD QUALMS

09:52.542 --> 09:55.458
I HAD QUALMS CALLING HIM
BECAUSE KEVIN IS NEEDY.

09:55.500 --> 09:58.750
YOU HAVE TO EXPLAIN EVERYTHING
A THOUSAND TIMES.

09:58.792 --> 10:00.750
HE GETS SO EMOTIONAL.
IT'S JUST...

10:00.792 --> 10:02.250
IT'S EXHAUSTING.

10:02.291 --> 10:04.417
NOW YOU'LL BE
JUST SWEET ENOUGH

10:04.458 --> 10:07.041
THAT HE'LL AGREE
TO GIVE YOU A KIDNEY.
WELL, THAT'S WHAT YOU
TOLD ME TO DO, DR. KING.

10:07.083 --> 10:10.041
AND THE TRUTH IS,
I WON'T HAVE TO BE THAT SWEET.

10:10.083 --> 10:11.959
KEVIN IDOLIZES ME.

10:12.000 --> 10:14.041
HE'LL DO ANYTHING FOR ME.

10:14.083 --> 10:17.041
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

10:17.083 --> 10:19.041
DR. BENNETT WANTED US TO TALK.

10:19.083 --> 10:21.458
TO MAKE SURE WE'RE READY
TO HAVE ANOTHER BABY.

10:21.500 --> 10:23.041
WE GET IT.

10:23.083 --> 10:25.041
WELL, WE'D ALSO
LIKE TO UNDERSTAND

10:25.083 --> 10:28.041
WHY YOU DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING
ABOUT HOW YOUR SON DIED

10:28.083 --> 10:30.166
WHEN YOU FIRST CAME IN.

10:30.208 --> 10:32.750
PEOPLE LOOK AT YOU DIFFERENT

10:32.792 --> 10:34.792
WHEN THEY KNOW.

10:34.834 --> 10:36.709
THEY JUDGE.

10:36.750 --> 10:39.709
BUT WE'RE GOOD PARENTS,
AND WE'D LIKE TO BE AGAIN.

10:39.750 --> 10:41.709
I HAVE NO DOUBT
YOU COULD BE GOOD PARENTS.

10:41.750 --> 10:44.750
WHAT I'D LIKE TO UNDERSTAND
IS HOW YOU GRIEVED HIS DEATH.

10:44.792 --> 10:47.333
HOW WE...

10:47.375 --> 10:49.625
HOW? UH...

10:51.834 --> 10:54.041
I DON'T KNOW HOW.

10:54.083 --> 10:55.542
THERE IS NO HOW.

10:55.583 --> 10:57.834
LIKE THERE'S A WAY TO GRIEVE.

10:57.875 --> 11:00.208
THERE'S NO WAY. YOU JUST...

11:03.417 --> 11:06.041
KENDRA TOOK MAX TO DAYCARE...

11:06.083 --> 11:08.583
EVERY DAY.

11:08.625 --> 11:11.041
THAT MORNING, SHE WASN'T
FEELING WELL. SHE HAD THE FLU.

11:11.083 --> 11:14.959
SO SHE ASKED... ME
TO TAKE MAX.

11:17.125 --> 11:19.709
WHEN I GET BEHIND THE WHEEL
IN THE MORNING,

11:19.750 --> 11:21.500
I ALWAYS DO THE SAME THING--

11:21.542 --> 11:23.500
BRIEFCASE ON THE SEAT,
COFFEE IN THE CUP HOLDER,

11:23.542 --> 11:25.041
TURN ON PUBLIC RADIO.

11:25.083 --> 11:28.083
LATER, I LEARNED THERE'S
A THING CALLED AUTOPILOT.

11:28.125 --> 11:29.750
(mouths word)

11:29.792 --> 11:31.125
YOU DO SOMETHING ENOUGH,

11:31.166 --> 11:33.125
YOU DON'T EVEN
THINK ABOUT IT ANYMORE.

11:33.166 --> 11:35.166
YOU DON'T EVEN
NOTICE IT ANYMORE.

11:36.917 --> 11:39.750
AND THAT'S WHAT I DID.

11:39.792 --> 11:42.333
I WENT INTO AUTOPILOT.

11:42.375 --> 11:46.959
ONE MINUTE I WAS
TURNING ON PUBLIC RADIO...

11:47.000 --> 11:50.000
AND THE NEXT,
I WAS IN MY OFFICE.

11:54.583 --> 11:57.333
THE CAR SEAT...

11:57.375 --> 12:01.625
THEY MAKE 'EM
SO THEY FACE BACKWARD...

12:01.667 --> 12:04.792
(voice breaking)
AND HE WAS SLEEPING.

12:04.834 --> 12:08.750
I DIDN'T HEAR HIM,
COULDN'T SEE HIM.

12:11.917 --> 12:17.000
I WAS SITTING AT MY COMPUTER,
LATE FOR A STAFF MEETING.

12:17.041 --> 12:19.500
IT WAS LUNCHTIME.

12:21.083 --> 12:23.583
AND THEN MY...

12:23.625 --> 12:26.792
SCREENSAVER POPPED UP.

12:26.834 --> 12:31.208
(voice breaking)
MAX'S FACE IS MY SCREENSAVER.

12:31.250 --> 12:34.041
AND I JUST... RAN.

12:34.083 --> 12:37.291
I RAN TO THE CAR.

12:37.333 --> 12:40.417
BUT... IT WAS SUMMER.

12:40.458 --> 12:43.458
IT WAS HOT, AND...

12:43.500 --> 12:45.041
(cries)

12:45.083 --> 12:47.041
(sobs)

12:49.083 --> 12:52.625
KENDRA, CAN YOU TELL ME
WHAT THIS HAS BEEN LIKE FOR YOU?

12:52.667 --> 12:55.208
YOU'RE ASKING ME
IF I HATE MY HUSBAND?

12:55.250 --> 12:57.625
NO--

12:57.667 --> 12:59.709
I DON'T.

12:59.750 --> 13:01.083
I'M...

13:01.125 --> 13:03.041
NUMB OR SOMETHING.

13:03.083 --> 13:05.041
BUT YOU'VE STAYED
WITH YOUR HUSBAND,

13:05.083 --> 13:07.041
AND YOU WANT TO HAVE
ANOTHER CHILD.

13:07.083 --> 13:09.917
EITHER I TRY
TO START OVER OR...

13:09.959 --> 13:11.917
OR WHAT?

13:13.542 --> 13:16.750
I... DON'T KNOW.

13:21.917 --> 13:24.875
HE HAS NO IDEA WHAT
HIS BROTHER'S ASKING HIM TO DO,

13:24.917 --> 13:26.959
WHAT IT MEANS
TO UNDERGO A SURGERY,

13:27.000 --> 13:29.041
AND THEN THE RISK
OF HAVING ONLY ONE KIDNEY

13:29.083 --> 13:32.041
WITH A FAMILY HISTORY
OF NEPHROTIC DISEASE.
IF KEVIN'S I.Q.
WERE 20 POINTS HIGHER,

13:32.083 --> 13:34.291
WE WOULDN'T EVEN
BE HAVING THIS CONVERSATION.

13:34.333 --> 13:35.917
WE'D BE PRAISING HIM

13:35.959 --> 13:38.917
FOR PUTTING HIS FAMILY FIRST
AND DOING THE RIGHT THING.

13:38.959 --> 13:40.542
LOOK... (sighs)

13:40.583 --> 13:42.583
I'M NOT IN LOVE
WITH THIS IDEA,

13:42.625 --> 13:45.542
BUT INTELLIGENCE
HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH LOVE.

13:45.583 --> 13:48.000
AND I THINK
KEVIN UNDERSTANDS THAT.

13:48.041 --> 13:50.041
I THINK KEVIN LOVES HIS BROTHER
AND FEELS A RESPONSIBILITY

13:50.083 --> 13:51.834
TO HELP HIM.
IS IT LOVE?

13:51.875 --> 13:54.291
OR IS KEVIN JUST SO STARVED
FOR HIS BROTHER'S ATTENTION

13:54.333 --> 13:56.291
AFTER BEING DUMPED
INTO SOME GROUP HOME

13:56.333 --> 13:59.417
THE MINUTE THEIR PARENTS DIED
THAT HE'D DO ANYTHING FOR HIM?

13:59.458 --> 14:01.041
RYAN'S AN ASS, SAM.

14:01.083 --> 14:05.625
MAYBE, BUT DOES THAT MEAN HE
DOESN'T HAVE THE RIGHT TO LIVE?

14:09.083 --> 14:10.417
ADDISON?

14:10.458 --> 14:12.125
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

14:12.166 --> 14:14.709
HEY. YEAH, I'M... FINE.

14:14.750 --> 14:17.542
I DIDN'T KNOW HOW YOU FELT
ABOUT VIOLET AND ME.

14:17.583 --> 14:19.959
YOU LOOKED UPSET,
SO I TH--I THOUGHT--

14:20.000 --> 14:23.041
DEAD BABIES.
THAT'S WHY I LOOK...

14:23.083 --> 14:24.542
UH, CONGRATULATIONS.

14:24.583 --> 14:27.375
LOOK, I KNOW HOW MUCH YOU WANTED
THINGS TO WORK OUT WITH SAM.

14:27.417 --> 14:29.333
AND I WAS HOPING
THEY WOULD, TOO,

14:29.375 --> 14:30.959
ESPECIALLY
GIVEN ME AND VIOLET.

14:31.000 --> 14:32.959
IT WOULD'VE BEEN... NICE.
YEAH.

14:33.000 --> 14:34.458
WOULD'VE BEEN NICE.

14:34.500 --> 14:36.333
IF YOU EVER WANT TO TALK--

14:36.375 --> 14:37.959
TALKING TO YOU

14:38.000 --> 14:39.959
ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED
BETWEEN ME AND SAM?

14:40.000 --> 14:41.959
I'D RATHER
THINK ABOUT DEAD BABIES.

14:42.000 --> 14:43.667
BUT... THANK YOU.

14:43.709 --> 14:45.667
OKAY. I DON'T WANT THIS
TO SOUND PATRONIZING,

14:45.709 --> 14:49.041
BUT YOU ARE GONNA FIND
SOMEONE GREAT.

14:49.083 --> 14:51.083
YOU WILL.

14:59.208 --> 15:03.667
(keyboard keys clicking)

15:03.709 --> 15:06.291
I GOT YOUR MESSAGE,
DR. BENNETT.

15:06.333 --> 15:08.291
YOU SAID
YOU WANTED TO SEE ME.

15:08.333 --> 15:10.500
HAVE A SEAT, DINK.

15:10.542 --> 15:14.875
(clicking continues)

15:14.917 --> 15:17.458
OKAY.

15:17.500 --> 15:19.792
WHAT THE HELL YOU DOING?

15:19.834 --> 15:23.125
UH, I'M NOT SURE
I UNDERSTAND--

15:23.166 --> 15:25.750
YOU HAVE A WIFE AND A CHILD,
AND YOU'RE NEVER AROUND.

15:25.792 --> 15:28.291
NOW I UNDERSTAND
IT CAN BE DIFFICULT

15:28.333 --> 15:30.291
ONCE THE EXCITEMENT
OF THE BIRTH WEARS OFF,

15:30.333 --> 15:33.208
BUT HEY, MAN, THIS IS--THIS IS
WHEN THE REAL WORK STARTS.

15:33.250 --> 15:36.542
I'M NOT AFRAID
OF HARD WORK.
WELL, THEN
WHY AREN'T YOU THERE?

15:36.583 --> 15:39.208
WHENEVER YOU'RE A NO-SHOW
FOR YOUR NEW FAMILY,

15:39.250 --> 15:41.208
NAOMI ENDS UP
CALLING ME FOR HELP,

15:41.250 --> 15:43.041
AND I'M HAPPY TO DO IT,

15:43.083 --> 15:46.417
BUT QUITE FRANKLY, I'M GETTING
TIRED OF COVERING FOR YOU.

15:46.458 --> 15:48.834
YEAH, IT'S JUST...
(sighs)

15:48.875 --> 15:52.291
IT'S JUST WHAT?

15:52.333 --> 15:54.083
I GOTTA GO.

15:56.333 --> 15:59.041
YES, THE FATHER CARRIES AROUND
ALMOST UNBEARABLE GUILT,

15:59.083 --> 16:01.250
AND, YES, THE MOTHER
HAS COMPENSATED

16:01.291 --> 16:04.333
BY ESSENTIALLY
SHUTTING DOWN EMOTIONALLY.
BUT YOU STILL THINK THAT
THEY SHOULD BE PARENTS AGAIN?

16:04.375 --> 16:06.333
WELL, THEY'RE STRUGGLING TO
ACCEPT A MAJOR TRAGEDY,

16:06.375 --> 16:09.333
BUT I-I DON'T THINK THEY'RE
UNREALISTIC ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED.

16:09.375 --> 16:12.041
THEY'VE GRIEVED.
IT'S BEEN TWO YEARS, OKAY?

16:12.083 --> 16:14.667
I'M JUST NOT SURE WHAT
THE MARGINAL BENEFIT WOULD BE

16:14.709 --> 16:17.041
TO MAKING THEM WAIT
TO START THEIR LIVES AGAIN.

16:17.083 --> 16:19.041
STOP TRYING TO JUSTIFY THIS
TO ME, OKAY?

16:19.083 --> 16:22.041
IT'S YOUR PRACTICE,
YOUR PATIENTS.
THEY NEED YOUR HELP, ADDISON.

16:22.083 --> 16:24.583
THE SURROGATE HAS SIGNIFICANT
SCARRING OF HER UTERUS

16:24.625 --> 16:26.750
SECONDARY TO INSTRUMENTATION
AFTER A POSTPARTUM HEMORRHAGE.

16:26.792 --> 16:29.583
NO. I'M NOT GETTING INVOLVED.
YOU'RE THE ONLY DOCTOR

16:29.625 --> 16:31.500
IN THIS HALF OF THE COUNTRY
WHO CAN HELP THEM.

16:31.542 --> 16:33.500
THEY'LL NEVER FIND
ANOTHER SURROGATE.

16:33.542 --> 16:36.291
THEY'LL NEVER BE ALLOWED
TO ADOPT.
HOW MUCH DO THEY NEED
TO SUFFER, ADDISON?

16:36.333 --> 16:38.583
AND I'M NOT BAITING YOU.
I'M REALLY ASKING.

16:38.625 --> 16:41.041
I'M NOT SURE IF THAT HUSBAND
OR THAT WIFE ARE EVER

16:41.083 --> 16:44.041
GONNA BE ABLE TO HEAL COMPLETELY
UNTIL THEY GET ANOTHER CHANCE,

16:44.083 --> 16:46.041
AND EVEN THEN,
THERE ARE NO GUARANTEES.

16:46.083 --> 16:48.583
BUT I THINK THEY DESERVE
A SHOT.

16:48.625 --> 16:52.041
DR. BENNETT SAID THAT MY KIDNEY
IS THE RIGHT ONE FOR RYAN.

16:52.083 --> 16:54.792
HOW GOOD'S THE MATCH?
6 OUT OF 6 ALLELES.

16:54.834 --> 16:56.500
HAVE A SEAT, KEVIN.

16:56.542 --> 16:58.500
I WANT TO HELP RYAN.

16:58.542 --> 17:00.041
IT'S NOT THAT SIMPLE.

17:00.083 --> 17:03.041
IF YOU GET SICK THE SAME WAY
RYAN IS, IT'LL BE A PROBLEM.

17:03.083 --> 17:05.041
THEN RYAN WILL HELP ME.

17:05.083 --> 17:07.041
I MEAN, HE'LL GIVE ME
HIS KIDNEY.

17:07.083 --> 17:09.041
IT DOESN'T WORK LIKE THAT.

17:09.083 --> 17:11.583
RYAN CAN'T GIVE YOU
HIS KIDNEY.
BUT HE WOULD.

17:11.625 --> 17:15.542
I MEAN, HE WOULD DO IT FOR ME
LIKE I WOULD DO IT FOR HIM.

17:15.583 --> 17:17.417
BROTHERS HELP EACH OTHER.

17:17.458 --> 17:19.125
RIGHT, DR. BENNETT?

17:19.166 --> 17:21.041
YEAH.

17:21.083 --> 17:23.041
THEY DO.

17:23.083 --> 17:26.041
I UNDERSTAND HOW MUCH
YOU WANT TO HELP YOUR BROTHER.

17:26.083 --> 17:29.625
BUT WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME
HE DID ANYTHING FOR YOU?

17:29.667 --> 17:31.041
WELL, HE'S REALLY BUSY.

17:31.083 --> 17:33.208
HE'S GOT A JOB,
AND I DON'T.

17:33.250 --> 17:35.375
IT'S OKAY
THAT YOU DON'T HAVE A JOB.

17:38.208 --> 17:42.041
MAYBE MY JOB
IS TO HELP RYAN?

17:46.458 --> 17:48.625
(elevator bell dings)

17:48.667 --> 17:50.625
DOES THE MAID OF HONOR
USUALLY MAKE A TOAST?

17:50.667 --> 17:53.041
USUALLY RIGHT AFTER HE HELPS
BUSTLE THE BRIDE'S DRESS.

17:53.083 --> 17:55.041
HEY, YOU KNOW WHAT?
YOU CAN THINK IT'S LAME,

17:55.083 --> 17:58.834
BUT IT'S A BIG DEAL.
IT'S--IT'S A WEIRD BIG DEAL.

17:58.875 --> 18:00.667
SHE'S TAKING ADVANTAGE
OF YOU.

18:00.709 --> 18:03.583
SHE'S NOT TAKING--WE HAVE
THAT KIND OF RELATIONSHIP.

18:03.625 --> 18:06.000
IT'S... SPECIAL.
(ding)

18:06.041 --> 18:09.041
WHAT'S VIOLET DO FOR YOU?

18:09.083 --> 18:13.458
SHE KNOWS ME
AND WHY I DO WHAT I DO.

18:13.500 --> 18:15.500
I CAN TALK TO VIOLET
ABOUT ANYTHING,

18:15.542 --> 18:18.417
AND AFTER I DO,
I KNOW WE'RE GONNA BE OKAY.
WELL, I'M GLAD TO HEAR
YOU AND VIOLET

18:18.458 --> 18:21.041
HAVE THIS THING TOGETHER
THAT MAKES YOU SO DAMN HAPPY.

18:21.083 --> 18:23.208
CALL ME CRAZY, BUT I FIGURED
YOU JUST DECIDED

18:23.250 --> 18:26.291
YOU WANTED TO MARRY ME
BECAUSE I WAS THAT PERSON.
WE'RE--WE'RE IN THE MIDDLE
OF AN ARGUMENT.

18:26.333 --> 18:29.291
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?
(sighs) I'M GETTING READY
TO HELP YANK THE KIDNEY

18:29.333 --> 18:32.333
OUT OF A MENTALLY RETARDED GUY
WHO DOESN'T KNOW ANY BETTER.

18:32.375 --> 18:35.000
I'M A HUMANITARIAN.
DIDN'T YOU KNOW THAT?

18:39.083 --> 18:41.041
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

18:41.083 --> 18:43.959
I... CAME UP FOR BREAKFAST.

18:44.000 --> 18:45.959
DID IT BELONG
TO SOMEONE ELSE?

18:46.000 --> 18:48.041
BECAUSE YOU LOOK GUILTY.

18:48.083 --> 18:50.750
I'M AVOIDING SOMEONE.
UH, WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

18:50.792 --> 18:52.750
I GOT BORED
HANGING AROUND ADDISON'S.

18:52.792 --> 18:55.125
I WAS KIND OF HOPING A PATIENT
WOULD STROKE OUT

18:55.166 --> 18:57.458
OR BANG THEIR SKULL
AGAINST SOMETHING

18:57.500 --> 19:00.375
SO I'D HAVE A CHANCE
TO CUT OPEN THEIR HEAD.
IF IT WERE ANYONE
BUT YOU SAYING THAT,

19:00.417 --> 19:03.083
I'D BE RECOMMENDING THERAPY.
(laughs)
SO WHO YOU HIDING FROM?

19:03.125 --> 19:05.959
CHARLOTTE.
OH, BECAUSE SHE PICKED COOPER?

19:06.000 --> 19:08.125
I'M MAD, WHICH IS...
COMPLETELY REASONABLE.

19:08.166 --> 19:09.750
DON'T YOU THINK?

19:09.792 --> 19:11.125
YOU'RE THE SHRINK.

19:11.166 --> 19:13.125
WE'RE NOTORIOUSLY BAD
AT SELF-ANALYSIS,

19:13.166 --> 19:16.959
BUT EVERY TIME I SEE CHARLOTTE,
I WANNA... PUNCH A PUPPY.

19:17.000 --> 19:18.583
(elevator bell dings)

19:18.625 --> 19:20.333
SHE SCREWED YOU, SHELDON.

19:20.375 --> 19:24.542
SHE DITCHED YOU FOR ANOTHER MAN.
YOU DON'T HAVE TO LET IT GO.
WELL, I-I JUST--

19:24.583 --> 19:26.333
WHY HIDE YOUR FEELINGS?
YOU WORK HERE.

19:26.375 --> 19:28.166
WALK AROUND
WITH YOUR HEAD HELD HIGH

19:28.208 --> 19:31.875
AND SAY
TO HELL WITH CHARLOTTE KING.
(clicks buttons)

19:34.583 --> 19:37.000
I'M NOT A BAD GUY, DR. KING.

19:37.041 --> 19:38.542
I JUST...

19:38.583 --> 19:40.542
YOU KNOW,
I SPENT MY WHOLE LIFE

19:40.583 --> 19:44.125
WATCHING MY PARENTS
SO FOCUSED ON KEVIN.

19:44.166 --> 19:47.041
IT WAS ALWAYS ABOUT HIM.

19:47.083 --> 19:49.917
I JUST HAD... ME.

19:49.959 --> 19:51.583
I'M SURE
IT MUST HAVE BEEN DIFFICULT.

19:51.625 --> 19:53.041
WHEN THEY DIED,

19:53.083 --> 19:55.166
I WAS IN THE MIDDLE
OF BUILDING A BUSINESS,

19:55.208 --> 19:57.792
OF BUILDING A LIFE
FOR MYSELF.

19:57.834 --> 20:00.792
I COULDN'T TAKE CARE OF HIM
THE WAY HE NEEDS.

20:00.834 --> 20:03.000
WE BOTH WOULD'VE BEEN
WORSE OFF.

20:04.458 --> 20:07.375
AFTER A WHILE,
I HAD MY LIFE,

20:07.417 --> 20:10.208
HE HAD HIS.

20:10.250 --> 20:14.000
THINK ABOUT WHAT HE'S DOING
FOR YOU NOW.

20:14.041 --> 20:17.000
LET'S GET HIM PREPPED.

20:19.250 --> 20:22.041
IS THIS LOW BACK SEXY

20:22.083 --> 20:26.041
OR A LITTLE HOOCHIE?

20:26.083 --> 20:27.792
RIGHT.
IT'S A LITTLE HOOCHIE.

20:27.834 --> 20:30.041
THEN THERE'S THIS ONE,
WHICH IS, UM...

20:30.083 --> 20:31.458
(unzips zipper)

20:31.500 --> 20:33.041
VERY, VERY BEAUTIFUL,

20:33.083 --> 20:35.250
BUT DO YOU THINK
I CAN CARRY OFF

20:35.291 --> 20:37.000
A BOW AT THE BUST?

20:39.250 --> 20:41.417
COOPER?
I CAN'T DO WEDDING STUFF
RIGHT NOW.

20:41.458 --> 20:43.417
OKAY. WELL, I HAVE TO PUT ON

20:43.458 --> 20:46.041
ONE OF THESE DRESSES
IN THE NEXT 24 HOURS,

20:46.083 --> 20:49.041
SO WHEN EXACTLY
DO YOU WANT TO DO IT?
WHY DO I HAVE TO DO IT AT ALL?

20:49.083 --> 20:51.041
WAIT.
AM I--AM I TALKING TO,

20:51.083 --> 20:54.208
UH, OBJECTIVE COOPER
OR FRIEND COOPER RIGHT NOW?
(sighs)

20:54.250 --> 20:57.208
FRIEND COOPER WOULD SAY,
SKIP THE BOW.

20:57.250 --> 20:59.125
OBJECTIVE COOPER WOULD SAY,

20:59.166 --> 21:01.834
SKIP THE WEDDING.
STILL?

21:01.875 --> 21:04.834
WOW. YOU CAN'T GET THESE GUYS
ON THE SAME PAGE, HUH?

21:04.875 --> 21:07.041
I'M WORKING ON IT.

21:07.083 --> 21:10.417
H-HOW WELL DO YOU THINK
YOU KNOW PETE?

21:10.458 --> 21:12.417
UM... WELL, LET'S SEE.

21:12.458 --> 21:14.041
WE, UH...

21:14.083 --> 21:16.041
WE CONCEIVED
A CHILD TOGETHER,

21:16.083 --> 21:19.125
AND THEN WENT THROUGH A--
OKAY. WERE YOU SURPRISED
WHEN HE PROPOSED?

21:19.166 --> 21:21.041
YES.

21:21.083 --> 21:23.250
BUT IT WAS
A GOOD SURPRISE.

21:23.291 --> 21:26.750
THIS TIME.

21:26.792 --> 21:30.125
ARE YOU REALLY
THAT WORRIED ABOUT ME?

21:30.166 --> 21:33.041
AND US.

21:33.083 --> 21:35.041
EVEN AFTER YOU AND PETE
GET MARRIED,

21:35.083 --> 21:38.041
I STILL WANT US TO BE US.

21:38.083 --> 21:39.750
WELL, THAT WILL NEVER CHANGE,

21:39.792 --> 21:42.792
EVER.

21:45.041 --> 21:47.000
HEY, ADDIE.
HAVE YOU GOT A SECOND?

21:47.041 --> 21:49.709
YEAH. WALK WITH ME.
HI, SAM.

21:49.750 --> 21:51.750
HEY, AMELIA.

21:51.792 --> 21:54.083
HELLO, ADDISON.

21:54.125 --> 21:56.500
HELLO.

21:56.542 --> 22:00.375
OKAY, WELL, I GOTTA GET BACK
TO THE HOSPITAL, SO...

22:00.417 --> 22:03.000
WHAT EXACTLY WENT ON
BETWEEN THE TWO OF YOU?

22:03.041 --> 22:05.041
BECAUSE THAT MOJO IS BAD.
(laughs)

22:05.083 --> 22:06.959
YOU WANTED SOMETHING,
AMELIA?

22:07.000 --> 22:08.417
YES. I TRIED CALLING DEREK.

22:08.458 --> 22:10.417
ACTUALLY,
I CALLED AND E-MAILED.

22:10.458 --> 22:12.500
HE'S IGNORING ME,
SO THE ONLY WAY

22:12.542 --> 22:14.542
I CAN FIND OUT HOW HE'S DOING
IS TO CALL MY MOTHER,

22:14.583 --> 22:17.125
WHO LECTURES ME ON HOW
I SHOULD CALL MY BROTHER,

22:17.166 --> 22:19.125
WHICH MEANS
I HAVE TO GET OFF THE PHONE

22:19.166 --> 22:21.542
BEFORE I FIND OUT
HOW HE'S DOING.
HE'S DOING FINE.

22:21.583 --> 22:24.041
WAIT, YOU'VE HEARD
FROM HIM?

22:24.083 --> 22:26.125
YES, AMELIA. I--

22:26.166 --> 22:28.792
WELL, THAT KINDA SAYS IT ALL,
DOESN'T IT?

22:32.667 --> 22:35.417
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

22:35.458 --> 22:37.041
HOW DID IT GO?

22:37.083 --> 22:38.458
SMOOTHLY.

22:38.500 --> 22:40.458
YOUR NEW KIDNEY
STARTED WORKING RIGHT AWAY.

22:40.500 --> 22:42.458
YOU'RE GONNA BE A BIT SORE,

22:42.500 --> 22:45.041
BUT WE'LL HAVE YOU
ON YOUR FEET IN NO TIME.

22:45.083 --> 22:48.041
WH--OH.
WHAT ABOUT KEVIN? IS HE OKAY?

22:48.083 --> 22:50.667
WELL, WHY DON'T YOU
ASK HIM YOURSELF?

22:50.709 --> 22:54.792
(beeping continues)

22:54.834 --> 22:58.458
HEY. DID IT WORK?
DID I HELP?

22:58.500 --> 23:01.041
YEAH. IT WORKED.

23:01.083 --> 23:02.792
YOU SAVED ME, BUDDY.

23:02.834 --> 23:04.166
I'M NEVER GONNA FORGET IT.

23:04.208 --> 23:06.917
I KNEW I COULD, RYAN.

23:06.959 --> 23:08.792
I KNEW IT.

23:08.834 --> 23:11.625
(beeping continues)

23:11.667 --> 23:15.041
IT'S GONNA BE DIFFERENT NOW.
I'M GONNA BE DIFFERENT.

23:15.083 --> 23:17.041
I'M HAPPY TO HEAR IT.

23:17.083 --> 23:19.417
HOW BAD IS THE SCARRING?

23:19.458 --> 23:22.041
(Dave) THERE'S SOMETHING
YOU CAN DO, RIGHT?

23:22.083 --> 23:24.834
SHARON REALLY WANTS
TO BE OUR SURROGATE.
MR. AND MRS. WALKER,

23:24.875 --> 23:27.417
WOULD YOU MIND GIVING ME
A MOMENT ALONE WITH SHARON?

23:33.917 --> 23:36.041
YOU CAN'T FIX ME, CAN YOU?

23:36.083 --> 23:38.667
I'D HAVE TO DO A HYSTEROSCOPY
AND RESECT THE SCAR,

23:38.709 --> 23:40.500
BUT, YES, I CAN.

23:40.542 --> 23:42.041
THAT'S--THAT'S GREAT.

23:42.083 --> 23:45.041
BUT THERE ARE RISKS--BLEEDING,
A PERFORATION, FURTHER INJURY.

23:45.083 --> 23:47.041
AND UNLESS YOU'RE INTENT
ON HAVING ANOTHER CHILD,

23:47.083 --> 23:49.041
THERE'S NO REASON THAT YOU
SHOULD TAKE THOSE RISKS.

23:49.083 --> 23:51.542
I REALLY WANT TO HAVE
A BABY FOR THE WALKERS.

23:51.583 --> 23:54.458
ARE YOU ESPECIALLY CLOSE
TO THEM?

23:54.500 --> 23:56.041
WE JUST MET.

23:56.083 --> 23:58.750
SO ARE YOU DOING IT
FOR THE MONEY?
NO.

23:58.792 --> 24:00.417
THEN MAY I ASK

24:00.458 --> 24:03.041
WHY YOU'RE SO INTERESTED
IN HELPING THEM?

24:03.083 --> 24:08.041
BECAUSE I KNOW
WHAT THEY'RE GOING THROUGH.

24:08.083 --> 24:11.041
I LOST A CHILD, TOO,

24:11.083 --> 24:13.458
THE SAME WAY.

24:17.500 --> 24:19.792
IT'S A HORROR SHOW.

24:19.834 --> 24:22.583
THAT MAYBE WE COULD MAKE
A LITTLE LESS HORRIFIC.

24:22.625 --> 24:26.083
WHY ARE YOU SO INTENT
ON HELPING THESE PEOPLE?
BECAUSE I HAVE TO BELIEVE
IN STARTING OVER.

24:26.125 --> 24:28.041
THERE'S ALWAYS
A POSSIBILITY.

24:28.083 --> 24:30.458
LOOK, ADDISON,
IT IS A CRAPPY WORLD--

24:30.500 --> 24:32.959
AMELIA SAID THAT--
BUT I CAN'T LIVE WITH THAT.

24:33.000 --> 24:37.250
WITH DELL AND--AND MAYA
AND WILLIAM AND DEREK--

24:37.291 --> 24:40.583
THERE HAS TO BE
A FLIP SIDE TO CRAPPY.

24:40.625 --> 24:42.583
WHY WON'T YOU HELP THEM?

24:42.625 --> 24:45.750
NAOMI, COULD WE HAVE
A MINUTE, PLEASE?

24:52.166 --> 24:55.041
I WAS THERE, SHELDON,
THAT DAY IN THE E.R.

24:55.083 --> 24:56.792
IT WAS UNBEARABLE.

24:56.834 --> 24:59.333
THE FATHER WAS DESTROYED,
THE MOTHER LOST EVERYTHING--

24:59.375 --> 25:01.417
HER BABY AND HER FAITH
IN HER HUSBAND.

25:01.458 --> 25:03.709
I MEAN, HOW CAN THEY
POSSIBLY MOVE PAST THAT?

25:03.750 --> 25:05.542
AND THEY'RE BOTH COMING FROM
THESE TERRIBLE PLACES,

25:05.583 --> 25:07.333
MOVING AS FAST AS THEY CAN,

25:07.375 --> 25:09.125
TRYING TO LEAVE
THE PAST BEHIND THEM

25:09.166 --> 25:11.166
BY MAKING THIS HUGE COMMITMENT,
AND--

25:11.208 --> 25:14.792
I WAS WONDERING WHY YOU WERE
SO EMOTIONAL ABOUT THIS.
WELL, I JUST TOLD YOU.

25:14.834 --> 25:17.542
NO, ADDISON, I'VE SPENT ENOUGH
TIME IN THE ELEVATOR WITH YOU

25:17.583 --> 25:20.291
TO KNOW THAT THIS ABOUT MORE
THAN MUST THE WALKERS.
NO, DON'T SHRINK ME, SHELDON.

25:20.333 --> 25:22.291
IT DOESN'T REQUIRE
A LOT OF SHRINKING.

25:22.333 --> 25:25.417
PEOPLE COMING FROM BAD PLACES,
JUMPING INTO SOMETHING FAST.

25:25.458 --> 25:27.041
N-NO, NO.

25:27.083 --> 25:29.583
PETE CHOSE VIOLET,
YOU CHOSE SAM,

25:29.625 --> 25:31.417
WHICH I REALIZE
THAT I ENCOURAGED.

25:31.458 --> 25:33.417
IN ANY EVENT,
PETE AND VIOLET WORKED OUT,

25:33.458 --> 25:35.792
YOU AND SAM DIDN'T.
NOW THEY'RE GETTING MARRIED,

25:35.834 --> 25:39.792
AND... AND YOU'RE THE ONE
THAT'S IN A BAD PLACE.

25:39.834 --> 25:41.375
I'M FINE.

25:41.417 --> 25:44.375
YOU WILL BE. BUT THE WALKERS?
THEY'RE FINE RIGHT NOW.

25:44.417 --> 25:47.000
GIVE THEM A CHANCE, ADDISON.

25:52.083 --> 25:55.166
I'M GOOD AT MY JOB.

25:55.208 --> 25:58.041
WELL, I WAS GONNA ASK
HOW EVERYONE'S FEELING,

25:58.083 --> 26:00.792
BUT I THINK THE BETTER
QUESTION IS, WHO'S WINNING?

26:00.834 --> 26:03.208
WE'RE NOT EXACTLY THERE YET.
RYAN'S TEACHING ME
HOW TO PLAY.

26:03.250 --> 26:05.083
(whispers indistinctly)

26:05.125 --> 26:07.458
YEAH.
LIKE THIS?

26:07.500 --> 26:09.083
MM-HMM.
ANOTHER ONE?

26:09.125 --> 26:11.041
HEY.
KING ME.

26:11.083 --> 26:14.667
YOU HEARD THE MAN.
KING HIM.
ONCE WE GET ALL BETTER,
RYAN AND ME,

26:14.709 --> 26:18.041
WE'RE GONNA PLAY TOGETHER
ALL THE TIME.
YOU TWO ARE GONNA HAVE
A REGULAR CHECKERS DATE?

26:18.083 --> 26:20.709
YEAH, WE'RE GONNA PLAY
ALL THE TIME AT RYAN'S HOUSE.

26:20.750 --> 26:22.250
IT'S REALLY BIG.
MM.

26:22.291 --> 26:25.041
YEAH. THERE'S A POOL.
SOUNDS LIKE HE HAS BIG PLANS

26:25.083 --> 26:28.041
FOR YOUR FUTURE TOGETHER.
HE'S GETTING
A LITTLE AHEAD OF HIMSELF.

26:28.083 --> 26:29.709
YEAH. HE MUST BE CRAZY

26:29.750 --> 26:31.750
TO THINK YOU'D PUT YOURSELF
OUT FOR HIM

26:31.792 --> 26:33.750
AFTER WHAT HE DID FOR YOU.

26:33.792 --> 26:35.458
OH! (chuckles)

26:35.500 --> 26:37.875
DR. KING, RYAN...

26:37.917 --> 26:39.834
SAID THAT I COULD DRIVE
HIS CONVERTIBLE.

26:39.875 --> 26:42.291
HOLD ON. I DIDN'T SAY YOU COULD
DRIVE THE CONVERTIBLE.

26:42.333 --> 26:45.667
NO.
I SAID WE WOULD GO DRIVING
IN THE CONVERTIBLE.

26:45.709 --> 26:48.834
NO. (laughs) YOU--YOU SAID THAT
I COULD DRIVE THE CONVERTIBLE.
AAH! OH!

26:48.875 --> 26:51.125
KEVIN, SIT DOWN.
AH!

26:51.166 --> 26:53.125
SIT DOWN!
AAH! OH!

26:53.166 --> 26:55.458
(Kevin) WHAT DID I DO?
YOU'RE BLEEDING
INTO YOUR ABDOMEN.

26:55.500 --> 26:58.125
I NEED SOME HELP IN HERE!
I'M SORRY. WHAT DID I DO?

26:58.166 --> 27:00.542
GET HIM OUTTA HERE.
WHAT DID I DO?

27:00.583 --> 27:03.041
TAKE HIM BACK TO HIS ROOM. GO.
I'M SORRY. I'M SORRY.
I'M SORRY. WHAT HAPPENED?

27:03.083 --> 27:05.667
WHAT DID I DO?
WHAT DID I DO?
(Ryan groaning)

27:05.709 --> 27:07.625
WHAT DID I DO?!

27:11.959 --> 27:13.917
SO I TALKED
TO THE FLOWER LADY,

27:13.959 --> 27:17.917
AND, UH, I HAVE TO LEAVE
A MESSAGE FOR THE CAKE PEOPLE.
I DID THAT LAST NIGHT.

27:17.959 --> 27:20.917
OH. I'M GONNA HAVE TO GET
A MANI-PEDI LATER.
I'M GONNA HAVE A DRINK
WITH SAM TONIGHT

27:20.959 --> 27:22.291
AND JUST SHOW UP TOMORROW.

27:22.333 --> 27:25.291
I GUESS WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT
WHAT WE'RE DOING WITH LUCAS.

27:25.333 --> 27:27.166
MM-HMM.

27:27.208 --> 27:29.083
(laughs)
DOES IT EVER OCCUR TO YOU

27:29.125 --> 27:30.709
THAT WE'RE
DOING EVERYTHING BACKWARDS?

27:30.750 --> 27:33.041
BABY FIRST, WEDDING SECOND.
YEAH. I MEAN, TECHNICALLY,

27:33.083 --> 27:35.500
I'VE NEVER ACTUALLY BEEN
ON A DATE WITH YOU.
I'LL TAKE YOU ON A DATE

27:35.542 --> 27:38.959
IF I CAN MAKE OUT WITH YOU
IN MY CAR AFTER.
NO, I'M SERIOUS.
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO DATE FIRST,

27:39.000 --> 27:42.041
AND THEN THAT'S HOW
YOU GET TO KNOW SOMEONE.
WE KNOW EACH OTHER.

27:42.083 --> 27:44.959
SO YOU'RE NOT WORRIED ABOUT
SPENDING FOREVER WITH ME?

27:45.000 --> 27:48.125
NOT REALLY.
'CAUSE WE'RE JUST KINDA
JUMPING INTO THIS.

27:48.166 --> 27:51.125
LOOK, YOU CAN NEVER KNOW
EVERYTHING ABOUT SOMEONE,

27:51.166 --> 27:53.041
BUT ABOUT ME?

27:53.083 --> 27:54.792
YOU KNOW ENOUGH.

28:05.417 --> 28:08.333
RELAX.

28:08.375 --> 28:10.041
IT'S GONNA BE GREAT.

28:12.208 --> 28:14.125
(boy) OVER HERE!

28:14.166 --> 28:16.208
(indistinct shouting)

28:16.250 --> 28:18.625
DINK. SCHOOL'S OVER.

28:18.667 --> 28:21.417
HOW COME YOU'RE NOT HOME
WITH MAYA AND OLIVIA?

28:21.458 --> 28:24.583
WE'RE KIND OF IN THE MIDDLE
OF A GAME HERE, BRO.
YOUR GAME'S KINDA OVER, BRO.

28:24.625 --> 28:26.375
DUDE.

28:26.417 --> 28:28.375
GET LOST.

28:28.417 --> 28:31.625
YOU BETTER
GET OUT MY FACE.

28:31.667 --> 28:33.375
(girl) READY. OKAY.

28:33.417 --> 28:36.041
MRS. BENNETT IS DIFFERENT THAN
YOU. SHE DOESN'T WANT ME AROUND.

28:36.083 --> 28:38.375
SO WHAT? WHAT?
YEAH, SO SHE'S ALWAYS
IN MY FACE,

28:38.417 --> 28:41.041
TELLING ME
I'M DOING THINGS WRONG.

28:41.083 --> 28:43.583
THEN SHE JUST TELLS ME
TO GO HOME.

28:43.625 --> 28:45.291
ALL RIGHT. LET'S PLAY.

28:45.333 --> 28:48.208
IT'S NOT THAT I DON'T WANT
TO SEE MAYA AND OLIVIA. I DO.

28:48.250 --> 28:50.208

ALL THE TIME.
