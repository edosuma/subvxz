01:03.267 --> 01:05.434
Do you wanna go fast, Spice?

01:28.016 --> 01:30.474
- Hey!
- Hey, Autumn. How was your ride?

01:30.475 --> 01:33.182
You should've seen Spice
out there this morning.

01:33.183 --> 01:34.556
He was practically flying.

01:34.557 --> 01:36.223
I didn't have a stopwatch on me

01:36.224 --> 01:39.890
but I probably guess
about two-years-ago fast.

01:39.891 --> 01:41.681
Whoa! So, wait.

01:41.682 --> 01:43.972
Does that mean that you're
thinking of training him again?

01:43.973 --> 01:47.515
Oh, no.
Those days are long behind us.

01:47.516 --> 01:49.806
Plus, even if I wanted to,

01:49.807 --> 01:52.181
it's not like I can afford it.

01:52.182 --> 01:54.099
Okay.

01:55.681 --> 01:58.431
- Still, exciting though.
- Yeah.

02:00.890 --> 02:03.806
So, is Coco ready
for her lesson?

02:03.807 --> 02:05.013
All set.

02:05.014 --> 02:06.972
Come on.

02:08.514 --> 02:11.390
Now, shake your head like this.

02:13.389 --> 02:15.263
Good, you're ready to go.

02:15.264 --> 02:16.638
Autumn?

02:16.639 --> 02:19.638
You ready for your first lesson?

02:19.639 --> 02:20.430
Mm-hm.

02:20.430 --> 02:21.388
This is Coco

02:21.389 --> 02:22.596
and she's very sweet

02:22.597 --> 02:25.263
and she is very excited
to meet you.

02:26.555 --> 02:28.554
Go ahead, she won't bite.

02:28.555 --> 02:31.387
Hi, Coco. It's nice to meet you.

02:50.554 --> 02:52.513
- Hey!
- Hey.

02:59.678 --> 03:00.761
Hey, what's wrong?

03:00.762 --> 03:02.886
- Nothing.
- Nothing?

03:02.887 --> 03:04.260
The horses and I can practically

03:04.261 --> 03:06.094
hear your frustration
from the stables.

03:06.095 --> 03:08.885
Well, it's either
I've gotten worse at math

03:08.886 --> 03:12.052
or the ranch is in even
bigger trouble than I thought.

03:12.053 --> 03:13.011
That bad?

03:13.012 --> 03:14.052
Yeah, this place wasn't meant

03:14.053 --> 03:15.427
to be run by one person.

03:15.428 --> 03:16.885
It's too much.

03:16.886 --> 03:18.760
Don't panic.
You'll figure something out.

03:18.761 --> 03:20.135
I'm not panicking.

03:20.136 --> 03:21.301
You are practically

03:21.302 --> 03:22.384
scrubbing a hole
into this counter.

03:22.385 --> 03:24.468
Oh, well, it's filthy.

03:24.469 --> 03:27.010
It's fine. You're panicking.

03:28.344 --> 03:30.051
Maybe I can have a yard sale.

03:30.052 --> 03:32.134
That would totally
bring in extra money.

03:32.135 --> 03:33.510
Get rid of some old junk.

03:33.511 --> 03:36.176
See? Now you're thinking.

03:36.177 --> 03:37.467
It's actually really productive

03:37.468 --> 03:38.550
that you clean
when you're stressed.

03:38.551 --> 03:40.884
I don't clean when I'm...

03:40.885 --> 03:43.801
Whatever. Just help me.

03:58.717 --> 04:01.633
Think I can get three bucks
for this thing?

04:01.634 --> 04:03.591
Oh, no, we, we can't sell that.

04:03.592 --> 04:06.758
Ben got me this
when we first opened the ranch.

04:06.759 --> 04:09.299
- As what, a paperweight?
- As a joke.

04:09.300 --> 04:13.091
- Oh, so it is useless.
- It's sentimental.

04:13.092 --> 04:14.882
If you keep putting stuff
in that pile,

04:14.883 --> 04:16.548
we're gonna have nothing
left to sell, Autumn.

04:16.550 --> 04:20.673
Let's just not
sell Ben's stuff yet, okay?

04:31.882 --> 04:33.381
That's a great lamp.

04:33.382 --> 04:35.673
- Huh?
- The lamp, it's a good one.

04:35.674 --> 04:37.839
Three brightness levels.

04:39.257 --> 04:42.048
I'll give you $8 for it.

04:42.049 --> 04:44.589
It's a really nice lamp.

04:44.590 --> 04:47.172
- How about $15?
- How about $7?

04:47.173 --> 04:50.214
No, you're supposed to go up.
Actually, you know what?

04:50.215 --> 04:52.756
I really like this lamp,
so I'm just gonna take it...

04:52.757 --> 04:55.715
Sir, $7 would be perfect.

04:57.381 --> 05:01.505
Mom, look! A horse!
Can we get it?

05:01.506 --> 05:03.005
I'm sorry, but that horse

05:03.006 --> 05:05.505
is just about the one thing
not for sale.

05:05.506 --> 05:07.047
Why don't you run inside
and find something you can

05:07.048 --> 05:10.006
afford with your allowance, huh?

05:12.130 --> 05:14.046
This is a beautiful property.

05:14.047 --> 05:16.671
Thank you.

05:16.672 --> 05:20.379
Uh... In case you're ever
in the market to sell...

05:20.380 --> 05:21.545
Oh, uh, no...

05:21.546 --> 05:24.629
It's just something
to think about.

05:24.630 --> 05:27.670
This really is a...
It's a gorgeous property.

05:27.671 --> 05:30.962
I can sell it in no time
if you do decide to put it up.

05:30.963 --> 05:34.129
Thanks. Good to know.

05:44.379 --> 05:46.003
I knew you had a big house

05:46.004 --> 05:49.920
but right now,
I think there's an echo.

05:49.921 --> 05:53.836
It looks like when Ben and I
first moved in.

05:53.837 --> 05:56.336
People thought we were crazy
for buying such a big property

05:56.337 --> 05:59.669
to fix ourselves, but there was
something about this place.

05:59.670 --> 06:02.419
You know how you, uh, can't
get a song out of your head?

06:02.420 --> 06:03.585
Yeah, sure.

06:03.586 --> 06:04.877
It's kinda like that
with this place.

06:04.878 --> 06:07.002
I just could not
get it out of my head.

06:07.003 --> 06:09.335
You did an incredible job.

06:09.336 --> 06:13.710
Building a home, welcoming
so many people into it.

06:13.711 --> 06:16.668
For a while, at least.

06:16.669 --> 06:19.585
Chloe, if the yard sale was
to help keep the ranch afloat,

06:19.586 --> 06:21.335
why does it feel
like I'm moving?

06:21.336 --> 06:23.793
Just wait
and see how you did today

06:23.794 --> 06:25.919
before you make any decisions.

06:26.460 --> 06:27.543
Yeah.

06:35.210 --> 06:37.418
Someone tried to buy you today.

06:39.710 --> 06:41.292
Don't worry.

06:41.293 --> 06:44.126
You're in the sentimental pile.

06:47.459 --> 06:50.001
What am I gonna do, Spice?

06:57.918 --> 07:00.416
How's it looking?

07:00.417 --> 07:03.208
Well, we did better
than I thought we would.

07:03.209 --> 07:06.832
Sounds like there's
a, a "but" coming.

07:06.833 --> 07:10.208
Even with the money
we made today

07:10.209 --> 07:11.999
and the extra riding lessons,

07:12.000 --> 07:15.041
I can still barely cover
next month's mortgage.

07:15.042 --> 07:16.499
Oh, Autumn, I'm sorry.

07:16.500 --> 07:19.707
I don't know
how I let it get so bad.

07:19.708 --> 07:22.373
If I have to close the ranch,

07:22.374 --> 07:25.040
I feel like I'd be letting down
Ben's memory.

07:25.041 --> 07:27.457
You listen to me,
Autumn Carlisle.

07:27.458 --> 07:29.831
You and my son took a chance
on this place

07:29.832 --> 07:34.040
when everyone told you
not to take the risk.

07:34.041 --> 07:36.206
You followed your instinct then

07:36.207 --> 07:39.122
and created something
really wonderful.

07:39.123 --> 07:41.581
Follow that instinct again now.

07:41.582 --> 07:45.039
It won't be easy by any stretch
of the imagination

07:45.040 --> 07:47.498
but maybe it's time to move on.

07:47.499 --> 07:49.872
Time to let this place go.

07:49.873 --> 07:53.455
Plus, it's high time
you let me retire.

07:53.456 --> 07:55.330
I've got a life
of my own to live.

07:55.331 --> 07:58.288
I didn't realize
I was keeping you.

08:00.331 --> 08:03.455
Oh, there may be another option?

08:03.456 --> 08:05.954
I will not let you
sell a kidney.

08:05.955 --> 08:08.038
I could start training again.

08:08.039 --> 08:10.537
Training?
Is that something you wanna do?

08:10.538 --> 08:13.871
If it means keeping the ranch.

08:13.872 --> 08:16.038
Maybe if I hadn't taken
a step back from training,

08:16.039 --> 08:17.454
I wouldn't be in this mess.

08:17.455 --> 08:18.705
But I...

08:20.205 --> 08:23.704
With Ben gone, I couldn't.

08:23.705 --> 08:27.371
It's what we did together,
you know?

08:28.371 --> 08:29.413
I know.

08:31.871 --> 08:36.038
Thank you, Howard,
for everything.

08:36.953 --> 08:38.912
We're family, Autumn.

08:38.913 --> 08:40.369
No matter what.

08:40.370 --> 08:42.703
No matter where.

08:42.703 --> 08:44.745
Remember that, okay?

08:44.746 --> 08:45.869
Okay.

09:35.534 --> 09:37.034
What do you say, Spice?

09:37.035 --> 09:39.533
You wanna get back into racing?

09:41.701 --> 09:44.826
Yeah, didn't think so.

09:47.618 --> 09:50.533
- All right, batter's ready.
- Okay. Perfect.

09:50.534 --> 09:52.408
Hon... Well...

09:52.409 --> 09:55.241
Who wants chocolate chip,
and who wants blueberry?

09:55.242 --> 09:56.574
- Can I have both?
- Hmm.

09:56.575 --> 09:58.617
- I don't see why not.
- Okay.

10:00.117 --> 10:02.532
You have to teach me
this perfect pancake recipe.

10:02.533 --> 10:03.658
Happy to.

10:12.075 --> 10:13.948
Sorry. The syrup.

10:13.949 --> 10:15.698
Oh...

10:15.699 --> 10:17.449
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

10:18.699 --> 10:20.032
Okay, gang.

10:20.033 --> 10:21.699
Family meeting.

10:23.282 --> 10:27.324
I've, uh, thought
about this a lot.

10:28.948 --> 10:30.323
And...

10:30.324 --> 10:32.406
And I've decided

10:32.407 --> 10:34.782
that I'm putting the ranch
up for sale.

10:35.948 --> 10:38.031
I want you to know
how thankful I am

10:38.032 --> 10:41.530
for all the years
that we spent here together.

10:41.531 --> 10:43.363
I couldn't have
done it without you.

10:44.823 --> 10:50.405
This... has been
a very hard decision to make

10:50.406 --> 10:53.239
but I think
it's the right decision.

10:55.531 --> 10:57.738
And I hope that you do, too.

11:00.947 --> 11:03.155
We're so proud of you.

11:03.156 --> 11:04.988
We support you
no matter what, Autumn.

11:04.989 --> 11:07.114
Oh, you're the best.

11:10.363 --> 11:14.071
- Well, these posts here.
- Mm-hm.

11:14.072 --> 11:15.362
What if we knocked 'em down?

11:15.363 --> 11:18.530
Don't you think
there'd be more flow?

11:20.529 --> 11:23.488
Well, I believe
that they're load-bearing.

11:24.696 --> 11:26.528
The house itself is okay

11:26.529 --> 11:28.445
but I, I hate the paint color.

11:28.446 --> 11:31.195
Oh, that's easy to change.

11:31.196 --> 11:34.111
Wow!

11:34.112 --> 11:36.612
You know, is there any
stipulation that I can't build

11:36.613 --> 11:39.029
the world's largest hay maze?

11:39.779 --> 11:41.778
Not to my knowledge.

11:41.779 --> 11:44.861
Um, might be a zoning issue.

11:44.862 --> 11:46.527
- That's why I asked you.
- Yeah.

11:46.528 --> 11:49.278
- Yeah, that's a fair question.
- Yeah, you know...

12:08.652 --> 12:11.651
I, uh, didn't realize
anyone else was in here.

12:11.652 --> 12:14.568
Oh, hey, I was, uh...

12:14.569 --> 12:17.026
just having a look around.

12:17.027 --> 12:18.735
Are they, are they yours?

12:18.736 --> 12:19.818
Mm-hmm.

12:21.486 --> 12:23.525
You're good with them.
Do you ride?

12:23.526 --> 12:25.276
No, no.

12:25.277 --> 12:27.358
My, uh...

12:27.359 --> 12:28.609
my mom used to.

12:28.610 --> 12:31.734
She tried to teach me,
but I, uh...

12:31.735 --> 12:34.734
When I was a kid, I was just
terrified of these guys.

12:34.735 --> 12:37.983
So big and ferocious.

12:37.984 --> 12:40.317
They're not so scary.

12:40.318 --> 12:42.775
Guess they're smaller now.

12:45.525 --> 12:46.984
He likes you.

12:48.400 --> 12:49.733
What's his name?

12:49.734 --> 12:51.858
Uh, that one is Coco.

12:51.859 --> 12:53.399
Hmm.

12:53.400 --> 12:55.733
And, uh, your name is...

12:55.734 --> 12:57.858
Oh, I'm Jake Stevens.

12:57.859 --> 12:59.691
Autumn Carlisle.

12:59.692 --> 13:01.399
Of Carlisle Ranches.

13:01.400 --> 13:03.690
The one and only.

13:03.691 --> 13:05.857
So, uh, tell me, Jake Stevens

13:05.858 --> 13:09.024
do you make it a habit wandering
into other people's barns?

13:09.025 --> 13:11.607
No. Yes, actually.

13:11.608 --> 13:13.024
Yeah, I, I do.

13:13.025 --> 13:14.982
I'm in construction, so I wander

13:14.983 --> 13:18.857
into people's houses,
or barns all the time.

13:18.858 --> 13:20.315
Professionally.

13:20.316 --> 13:21.315
Funny.

13:21.316 --> 13:23.315
I thought I knew everyone

13:23.316 --> 13:26.773
within a 20-mile radius
that did construction.

13:26.774 --> 13:29.565
Oh, I'm not from around here.

13:30.940 --> 13:33.272
Where do you live?

13:33.273 --> 13:35.856
Oh, just in and out of hotels.

13:35.857 --> 13:37.856
I kinda go wherever
the job brings me.

13:37.857 --> 13:40.606
So the job took you
to Millbrook?

13:40.607 --> 13:42.647
I was driving by.
I saw the "For sale" sign.

13:42.648 --> 13:45.355
So I thought I'd stop here
and check it out.

13:45.356 --> 13:49.147
This property is...
It's beautiful.

13:49.148 --> 13:51.064
Thank you.

13:51.065 --> 13:54.688
It used to be a lot,
uh... livelier.

13:54.689 --> 13:57.606
Yeah, I've been
wandering around all morning.

13:58.731 --> 14:01.937
I can't seem to get it
out of my head.

14:01.938 --> 14:04.897
It's funny thing, to think
about a property like that.

14:05.855 --> 14:08.812
Uh, that's not weird at all.

14:08.813 --> 14:11.812
This place was pretty worn down
when we bought it

14:11.813 --> 14:14.937
but I had the same feeling.

14:14.938 --> 14:17.353
So, you remodeled this yourself?

14:17.354 --> 14:21.562
It was a labor of love,
to say the least.

14:21.563 --> 14:25.645
But now with everyone
stomping around inside

14:25.646 --> 14:28.811
talking about my terrible taste
in this and that

14:28.812 --> 14:31.853
and brainstorming about which
wall they're gonna tear down

14:31.854 --> 14:34.686
to create the perfect flow...

14:36.188 --> 14:38.686
Maybe it's just a house

14:38.687 --> 14:41.102
but it's not just a house to me.

14:41.103 --> 14:44.687
It's my home.
It's my whole life.

14:45.645 --> 14:48.436
You know, if this was my home

14:48.437 --> 14:50.561
or my life...

14:52.519 --> 14:54.728
I wouldn't change a thing.

14:57.603 --> 14:58.728
Good luck.

15:03.352 --> 15:04.394
Thanks.

15:17.102 --> 15:19.350
We've had a few
very competitive offers

15:19.351 --> 15:20.893
some above asking, even.

15:20.894 --> 15:23.975
I'd be happy to go over them
with you, or...

15:23.976 --> 15:27.018
Did someone named Jake Stevens
make an offer?

15:27.809 --> 15:29.018
Uh...

15:30.518 --> 15:33.476
Why, yes. It looks like he did.

15:33.477 --> 15:36.100
Was it competitive?

15:36.101 --> 15:37.391
It's not the winner of the group

15:37.392 --> 15:40.143
but definitely in the game.

15:41.225 --> 15:43.309
I'll sell it to him.

15:44.851 --> 15:47.767
Don't you wanna take a couple
of days to think about it?

15:47.768 --> 15:49.475
Look over the other offers?

15:49.476 --> 15:51.516
The horses liked him.

15:51.517 --> 15:53.099
I'm sorry, the horses liked him?

15:53.100 --> 15:56.349
They're very
perceptive.

15:56.350 --> 15:58.058
Of course, they are.

15:58.059 --> 16:03.016
Plus, he never used the words
"Feng" or "Shui" once.

16:05.016 --> 16:06.516
Mr. Stevens it is.

16:08.224 --> 16:11.348
Uh, after the deal closes

16:11.349 --> 16:14.349
you'll have 30 days to move out.

16:17.224 --> 16:19.431
Wow.

16:19.432 --> 16:22.016
I can't believe
this is really happening.

16:38.182 --> 16:41.097
So, just... third page.

16:41.098 --> 16:43.014
Right. Great.

16:43.015 --> 16:45.430
Can you start looking
for potential buyers for me?

16:45.431 --> 16:48.138
The remodel won't take very long
and I'd like offers in early.

16:48.139 --> 16:49.971
- Remodel?
- Yeah.

16:49.972 --> 16:51.346
Actually, it's not that
extensive.

16:51.347 --> 16:53.180
We could probably
sell this on the plans.

16:53.181 --> 16:55.346
You're flipping the property?

16:55.347 --> 16:57.055
I'd be crazy not to.

16:57.056 --> 17:00.055
And this property is,
is way too big for one person.

17:00.056 --> 17:04.137
I'm gonna split up the land into
smaller plots and resell it.

17:04.138 --> 17:06.596
I'm gonna get a coffee,
do you want anything?

17:06.597 --> 17:09.763
- Uh, no. I'm good. Thank you.
- Okay.

17:13.929 --> 17:14.970
Oh, hey, sweetie.

17:14.971 --> 17:16.345
- Hi.
- How can I help you?

17:16.346 --> 17:18.553
Could I get a triple macchiato

17:18.554 --> 17:20.678
in a to-go cup, and, uh,

17:20.679 --> 17:22.887
give me one of those
chocolate donuts for here.

17:22.887 --> 17:26.387
Is your donut staying here while
your coffee jets off to Spain?

17:27.512 --> 17:29.012
No.

17:29.013 --> 17:32.344
No, I'm-I'm sitting right there.

17:32.345 --> 17:36.012
Coffee and a chocolate donut
for here. Anything else?

17:37.179 --> 17:39.511
Yeah. I'm, um, sorry, I just...

17:39.512 --> 17:42.344
I really prefer a to-go cup.
I, I see them right there.

17:42.345 --> 17:44.011
I can almost touch them.

17:44.012 --> 17:46.677
The to-go cups are
for to-go-ing customers.

17:46.678 --> 17:48.054
Anything else?

17:49.428 --> 17:51.510
Yeah, do you, uh, you have
any recommendations

17:51.511 --> 17:52.844
for a hotel around here?

17:52.845 --> 17:54.677
Nothing themed, please.

17:54.678 --> 17:57.343
Oh, you're the out-of-towner
who's buying Autumn's place.

17:57.344 --> 17:59.926
Wow,
news travels fast around here.

17:59.927 --> 18:01.843
We're tight knit.

18:01.844 --> 18:03.634
And since Autumn's husband
passed away,

18:03.635 --> 18:05.052
well, everyone's just
a little bit

18:05.053 --> 18:07.136
protective of her is all.

18:08.385 --> 18:10.676
I, I didn't realize.

18:10.677 --> 18:12.551
Black coffee and a donut.

18:12.552 --> 18:15.176
Yeah, there's an inn
over on Grove Street.

18:15.177 --> 18:17.885
- Great.
- But it's usually booked.

18:19.594 --> 18:20.634
Thanks.

18:29.551 --> 18:31.885
Autumn, you can do this.

19:07.549 --> 19:09.674
Maybe I can do this tomorrow.

19:30.007 --> 19:33.715
This would be a whole lot easier
if you were here to help me.

20:36.378 --> 20:38.462
You hungry, Spice?

20:39.462 --> 20:41.086
Just one more minute.

21:02.878 --> 21:05.668
You, uh, don't live here yet,
you know?

21:05.669 --> 21:07.418
Oh. Morning, Autumn.

21:07.419 --> 21:10.418
I hope you don't mind,
I brought my contractor along.

21:10.419 --> 21:11.542
- Contractor?
- Hi.

21:11.543 --> 21:13.293
- I'm Larry. Hi.
- Hey.

21:13.294 --> 21:14.959
So, you're renovating?

21:14.960 --> 21:16.459
Just a bit.

21:16.460 --> 21:18.876
I thought you said
you wouldn't change a thing.

21:18.877 --> 21:21.500
Well, you said this place
needs some livening up.

21:21.501 --> 21:23.459
Mind if we poke around?

21:23.460 --> 21:25.000
Be my guest.

21:25.001 --> 21:26.584
Yeah, you know,
if you were to tear this down

21:26.585 --> 21:27.833
you'd have a beautiful view
from the porch.

21:27.834 --> 21:29.916
No, you can't tear that down.

21:29.917 --> 21:32.708
It's got the best view
of the place.

21:32.709 --> 21:35.958
Well, the porch from the house
has the exact same view.

21:35.959 --> 21:37.958
Yeah, but this is closer.

21:37.959 --> 21:41.042
- To what?
- Nature.

21:41.043 --> 21:43.041
The porch is attached
to the house

21:43.042 --> 21:45.332
but right here

21:45.333 --> 21:48.082
it's just you and the land.

21:48.083 --> 21:50.291
Well, couldn't you just
stand here

21:50.292 --> 21:51.665
if you wanted to be closer?

21:51.666 --> 21:53.832
Because then you'd actually
be on the land

21:53.833 --> 21:56.167
because you'd be standing on it.

21:57.499 --> 21:59.166
Listen, I understand

21:59.167 --> 22:02.123
that you're trying
to get a jump start on things

22:02.124 --> 22:03.415
make it your own.

22:03.416 --> 22:06.582
But while I'm here, let it be.

22:06.583 --> 22:09.165
Unless you want me
to kick you off my property

22:09.166 --> 22:11.081
for the next 29 days

22:11.082 --> 22:13.665
which, legally, I can do.

22:16.166 --> 22:19.622
I think this gazebo looks
pretty good here, actually.

22:19.623 --> 22:21.664
- What do you think, Larry?
- Oh, yeah, it's, uh...

22:21.665 --> 22:25.165
Ahem, it's nice. It's very nice,
it's a very nice gazebo.

22:42.622 --> 22:44.413
That's strange.

22:44.414 --> 22:46.872
I got offers from other ranches.

22:46.873 --> 22:47.996
To buy you out?

22:47.997 --> 22:50.538
No. To hire me as a trainer.

22:50.539 --> 22:52.288
They must've heard
about the sale

22:52.289 --> 22:53.912
and assumed you were available.

22:53.913 --> 22:56.871
Well, I haven't trained
a racehorse in years.

22:56.872 --> 22:58.579
What makes them think
I still can?

22:58.580 --> 23:01.079
That's not something
that just goes away.

23:01.080 --> 23:04.955
But you decided you didn't wanna
get back into training, right?

23:05.830 --> 23:07.328
Right.

23:41.578 --> 23:43.869
I said you were welcome
on my property,

23:43.870 --> 23:46.910
I didn't say you can start
construction on my property.

23:46.911 --> 23:48.326
The guys are just
getting a few measurements.

23:48.327 --> 23:49.702
We're gonna be out of here
in no time.

23:49.703 --> 23:51.535
They're not the ones
I'm concerned about.

23:51.536 --> 23:53.744
You said you weren't gonna
change a thing.

23:53.745 --> 23:55.493
I'm not.

23:55.494 --> 23:59.326
Really, I, I might
put a hot tub in there.

23:59.327 --> 24:01.659
Never mind.
I don't wanna know.

24:01.660 --> 24:04.243
I am going to say goodbye
to this place

24:04.244 --> 24:08.492
and remember it as it is now,
in my memory forever.

24:08.493 --> 24:11.951
You know, places aren't meant
to stay the same forever.

24:14.201 --> 24:16.950
- Says who?
- Says me.

24:16.951 --> 24:18.658
I love showing up to new places

24:18.659 --> 24:20.908
and helping them
reach their full potential.

24:20.909 --> 24:24.159
It's kind of the way that
I leave my mark in this world.

24:24.160 --> 24:25.200
Okay.

24:25.201 --> 24:26.242
Well, you can walk around

24:26.243 --> 24:27.491
leaving your mark on everything

24:27.492 --> 24:29.116
and I'll leave things
as I found them,

24:29.117 --> 24:30.575
as they're meant to be.

24:30.576 --> 24:33.907
So, you never carved your name
on a desk at school?

24:33.908 --> 24:36.033
Everybody did that.

24:36.034 --> 24:38.283
Right, and then the next person
that sat there

24:38.284 --> 24:39.450
saw that it was different.

24:39.451 --> 24:40.367
Barely.

24:40.368 --> 24:41.367
But they looked at that name

24:41.368 --> 24:43.074
and thought, "Who's Autumn?

24:43.075 --> 24:44.366
Wonder what
she doing right now?"

24:44.367 --> 24:46.323
- They did not.
- Sure they did!

24:46.324 --> 24:48.490
You changed their life,
just a little bit

24:48.491 --> 24:49.782
because you left your mark.

24:49.783 --> 24:51.490
What on earth
does this have to do

24:51.491 --> 24:53.157
with you installing a hot tub?

24:53.158 --> 24:56.783
Because everything here
says "Autumn."

24:57.991 --> 24:59.740
But a hot tub...

24:59.741 --> 25:01.115
That says "Jake."

25:02.199 --> 25:04.407
- Hi, Autumn.
- Hey, Larry.

25:04.408 --> 25:06.906
Okay, so, Jake, uh, the guys
basically have everything

25:06.907 --> 25:09.489
they need now, so if you wanna
come over and check it.

25:09.490 --> 25:11.865
Great. See? Out of your hair.

25:16.490 --> 25:18.574
Nice PJs, by the way.

25:35.823 --> 25:38.238
Have you thought
about taking any of the offers?

25:38.239 --> 25:40.364
From the other ranches, I mean.

25:42.239 --> 25:43.531
Autumn?

25:44.864 --> 25:45.947
Autumn?

25:47.572 --> 25:49.487
So, I've been thinking about it

25:49.488 --> 25:52.487
and, uh, I decided last night

25:52.488 --> 25:54.821
I'm gonna marry a toaster.

25:54.822 --> 25:56.071
That's great.

25:57.488 --> 26:00.237
Autumn, are you feeling okay?

26:00.238 --> 26:02.945
I'm sorry.
I didn't sleep well last night.

26:02.946 --> 26:04.611
Jake showed up
with a construction crew

26:04.612 --> 26:06.195
at the crack of dawn.

26:06.196 --> 26:07.820
Ooh.

26:07.821 --> 26:10.486
Do you carve your name
into stuff?

26:10.487 --> 26:12.611
Not regularly.

26:12.612 --> 26:13.820
But when you were a kid.

26:13.821 --> 26:15.903
That's something people do,
right?

26:15.904 --> 26:16.987
Yeah, totally.

26:16.988 --> 26:18.278
Do you think that was your way

26:18.279 --> 26:20.611
of leaving your mark
on the world?

26:20.612 --> 26:24.528
Mm, no, I'm pretty sure I just
liked how my name looked.

26:24.529 --> 26:26.611
See? Normal.

26:32.237 --> 26:33.987
What in the world...

26:37.236 --> 26:38.570
Oh, oh.

26:43.111 --> 26:44.776
Hey!

26:44.777 --> 26:46.861
What are you doing?

26:49.445 --> 26:50.985
Hey!

26:50.986 --> 26:53.194
Hey, what are you doing?

26:54.652 --> 26:57.444
- What?
- Can you turn that thing off?

27:00.861 --> 27:04.735
- I'm sorry, what?
- I said, "What are you doing?"

27:06.193 --> 27:07.817
Well, you've gotta sand first
before you can paint.

27:07.818 --> 27:10.317
I-I know,
but why are you painting?

27:10.318 --> 27:14.151
Well, you made such
a big deal about this gazebo,

27:14.152 --> 27:16.026
thought I'd spruce it up for ya.

27:16.027 --> 27:17.650
You know, you could even
put a bench right there...

27:17.651 --> 27:18.692
I don't want a bench.

27:18.693 --> 27:20.025
I don't want new paint.

27:20.026 --> 27:22.650
There's already
too many changes.

27:22.651 --> 27:24.817
Just leave this one thing alone.

27:25.900 --> 27:26.984
Please?

27:27.817 --> 27:29.692
Okay. Sure.

27:30.859 --> 27:31.984
Thank you.

27:33.026 --> 27:36.441
I have a student coming later.

27:36.442 --> 27:38.692
Stay out of our way.

28:04.482 --> 28:06.314
Hey, remember, Maddie.

28:06.315 --> 28:08.814
Deep breaths, no fidgeting.

28:08.815 --> 28:10.357
I'm not.

28:18.481 --> 28:20.772
So, I've been thinking.

28:20.773 --> 28:23.147
I think you should take
one of my training offers.

28:23.148 --> 28:23.981
What?

28:23.982 --> 28:25.105
Not a bait and switch,

28:25.106 --> 28:25.981
or anything like that

28:25.981 --> 28:26.856
but I would present you

28:26.857 --> 28:28.063
as an alternative.

28:28.064 --> 28:29.813
So, you decided
to turn them down?

28:29.814 --> 28:31.397
Oh, I'm not sure yet.

28:31.398 --> 28:33.938
Did I tell you that I thought
about training again

28:33.939 --> 28:35.479
before I put the house
up for sale?

28:35.480 --> 28:36.855
- No.
- Yeah.

28:36.856 --> 28:38.980
The idea of starting
from the ground up again...

28:38.981 --> 28:40.771
I don't know,
it seemed overwhelming.

28:40.772 --> 28:42.938
And, at one of these ranches,
it would just be a day job

28:42.939 --> 28:44.979
which would be a nice change,
and I could

28:44.980 --> 28:46.479
board the horses for free.

28:46.480 --> 28:49.021
And I don't know a lot of places
I can go and do that.

28:49.022 --> 28:50.563
Yeah, they're not the easiest
house guests.

28:50.564 --> 28:52.688
Definitely not.

28:53.855 --> 28:55.312
All right, wait.

28:55.313 --> 28:57.687
What makes you think
I'd even be a good trainer?

28:57.688 --> 28:59.770
Well, for starters,
you're the reason

28:59.771 --> 29:01.729
I haven't broken down
in the last two years.

29:01.730 --> 29:04.938
So I pretty much think
you can do anything.

29:08.104 --> 29:10.186
So let's go find out.

29:17.271 --> 29:19.186
Whoo! Let's go, Chloe!

29:19.187 --> 29:20.562
- Go, Chloe!
- Yeah!

29:22.062 --> 29:24.811
Oh!

29:24.812 --> 29:27.227
Whoo! Great job!

29:27.228 --> 29:29.436
- Way to go, Chloe.
- Whoo!

29:29.437 --> 29:31.144
That was great.

29:31.145 --> 29:32.852
- How did we do?
- Oh.

29:32.853 --> 29:35.310
You've got this. Yes.

29:35.311 --> 29:36.893
Are we preparing for a race?

29:36.894 --> 29:38.685
Uh, we're thinkin' about it.

29:38.686 --> 29:41.393
Uh, Jake, this is Howard,
Ben's father.

29:41.394 --> 29:43.144
Hi. Jake Stevens.
Nice to meet you.

29:43.145 --> 29:45.102
- Likewise.
- And that is Chloe.

29:45.103 --> 29:47.601
An up-and-coming young trainer.

29:47.602 --> 29:49.768
- Hi.
- Nice to meet ya.

29:49.769 --> 29:51.476
So, what are you doing?

29:51.477 --> 29:53.351
Don't you have
somewhere else to be?

29:53.352 --> 29:55.851
Meh. This is much more fun.

29:55.852 --> 29:59.309
- Go, Chloe.
- Go, Chloe.

29:59.310 --> 30:00.435
All right.

30:10.018 --> 30:12.642
Hey, kiddo.
What can I get for you?

30:12.643 --> 30:14.766
Just a coffee. To go.

30:14.767 --> 30:16.767
Oh, you're not
sitting down today?

30:17.726 --> 30:20.850
No. No, I'm, uh, I'm on the go.

30:20.851 --> 30:24.474
Well... come back real soon.

30:24.475 --> 30:26.350
Great. Thanks.

30:40.933 --> 30:42.142
Changed my mind.

30:45.558 --> 30:48.473
Yes, I think we can
definitely section this off

30:48.474 --> 30:50.807
into its own property.

30:50.808 --> 30:53.181
Unless you think four units
is gonna crowd it?

30:53.182 --> 30:57.683
Mm, not if you renovate
the stable.

30:59.224 --> 31:00.515
- Yeah.
- Right?

31:00.516 --> 31:02.931
Look, Larry,
I think I got myself

31:02.932 --> 31:05.056
into a bit of hot water here.

31:05.057 --> 31:06.973
Whoa, whoa, we can't be
over budget already.

31:06.974 --> 31:08.305
My guys haven't even
started here, Jake.

31:08.306 --> 31:09.848
No, no, not, not with that.

31:09.849 --> 31:11.889
It's with Autumn.

31:11.890 --> 31:14.180
The owner, Autumn Carlisle.

31:14.181 --> 31:16.972
She thinks that I'm
moving into the ranch.

31:16.973 --> 31:18.847
- With her?
- No, no.

31:18.848 --> 31:21.139
No, she thinks I'm moving into
the house after she leaves.

31:21.140 --> 31:22.972
How come she thinks that?

31:22.973 --> 31:24.639
Well, I kinda let her.

31:25.848 --> 31:27.555
I had a chance
to tell her the truth

31:27.556 --> 31:29.346
and I didn't,
because I was afraid

31:29.347 --> 31:31.805
if she found out she was gonna
pull out of the sale.

31:31.806 --> 31:34.555
And we already got
a couple of potential buyers.

31:34.556 --> 31:35.972
So, I...

31:37.930 --> 31:39.430
I just didn't.

31:39.431 --> 31:41.556
It is just business, right?

31:43.139 --> 31:45.721
Yeah. Of course, always.

31:45.722 --> 31:47.804
What's the big deal then?

31:47.805 --> 31:49.721
Let her think
that you're gonna move in.

31:49.722 --> 31:53.762
A month from now...
don't move in.

31:53.763 --> 31:56.178
Jake Stevens!
You're everywhere today.

31:56.179 --> 31:59.137
Howard, hey, how are ya?
Uh, do you know Larry?

31:59.138 --> 32:01.637
- Howard.
- Hi, Larry. Nice meeting you.

32:01.638 --> 32:04.095
- Are you staying in town?
- No, no, I'm, uh...

32:04.096 --> 32:05.886
I'm at a motel off 44.

32:05.887 --> 32:07.345
Oh, that's a shame.

32:07.346 --> 32:09.386
There's a lovely little inn
on Grove.

32:09.387 --> 32:11.970
Yes, I know. Barb told me.

32:11.971 --> 32:14.262
It's only got three rooms.

32:14.971 --> 32:16.136
- Wow.
- Refill?

32:16.137 --> 32:17.803
- Uh, yes. Please, thank you.
- Oh.

32:17.804 --> 32:19.844
Can I have a little bit
more too, please?

32:19.845 --> 32:21.928
I gonna need you
to lift the lid.

32:23.845 --> 32:24.970
Of course.

32:26.137 --> 32:28.385
Thank you, Barb.

32:28.386 --> 32:29.928
- Hey, hon.
- Hey.

32:32.511 --> 32:34.677
This is a cute town, Howard.

32:34.678 --> 32:36.593
Do you guys get much
tourism around here?

32:36.594 --> 32:37.927
Not much.

32:37.928 --> 32:40.468
Maybe they know we have no place
to put 'em.

32:40.469 --> 32:44.593
Shame. It's really something to
look at when the leaves change.

32:44.594 --> 32:46.218
Don't the leaves
change everywhere?

32:46.219 --> 32:47.968
Oh, not like they do here.

32:47.969 --> 32:49.343
If we had the infrastructure,

32:49.344 --> 32:51.260
I bet this town would be
one of those places

32:51.261 --> 32:54.634
that people would come back to
year after year.

32:54.635 --> 32:56.384
As is, if you fall in love
with the place

32:56.385 --> 32:58.801
you're just gonna
have to up and move here.

32:58.802 --> 33:01.426
But you'll know all about that.

33:01.427 --> 33:02.718
Uh, speakin' of...

33:02.719 --> 33:04.800
I'll see you
back at the ranch, I'm sure.

33:04.801 --> 33:07.426
- Nice meeting you, Larry.
- Nice meeting you too, Howard.

33:07.427 --> 33:09.426
- Have a good day.
- See you, Howard.

33:09.427 --> 33:10.800
Well, anyways, if you wanna

33:10.801 --> 33:12.633
put it in four,
I mean, that's fine.

33:12.634 --> 33:14.258
That's, that's, that's doable.

33:14.259 --> 33:15.426
It's a good idea.

33:16.551 --> 33:18.633
Hello, Jake?

33:18.634 --> 33:20.091
What?

33:20.092 --> 33:21.633
You wanted to cordon
this off in four.

33:21.634 --> 33:23.216
- Right.
- That's fine, I, I mean, I...

33:23.217 --> 33:26.299
I don't disagree, I don't know
if I exactly agree.

33:54.174 --> 33:55.799
- Hey.
- Hey.

34:00.465 --> 34:01.631
Mind if I help?

34:01.632 --> 34:03.173
Go ahead.

34:13.422 --> 34:15.090
So, I was wondering...

34:16.505 --> 34:18.463
What would you possibly want

34:18.464 --> 34:21.005
with the ranch if you know
nothing about horses?

34:21.007 --> 34:23.295
I'm not sure what
I'm gonna do with it.

34:23.297 --> 34:25.213
All I know was that when I
came by the open house,

34:25.214 --> 34:27.630
I saw potential.

34:27.630 --> 34:30.880
I thought the same thing when I
first saw this place, too.

34:33.714 --> 34:37.130
I think I'd like to turn
that stable into a wood shop.

34:37.130 --> 34:39.963
Just the way it looks out
over the field there?

34:39.964 --> 34:41.379
That's somethin'.

34:41.380 --> 34:44.295
Working on furniture all day
looking at that.

34:44.295 --> 34:46.672
Good luck gettin'
that wet horse smell out.

34:47.630 --> 34:48.962
- Wet horse smell?
- Yeah.

34:48.963 --> 34:51.170
It's like a wet dog smell
but worse.

34:51.170 --> 34:52.920
Because horses are huge.

34:52.920 --> 34:54.878
Oh, I didn't realize. Thank you.

34:54.879 --> 34:58.461
I'm sorry, for bringing up
your irrational childhood fear.

34:58.462 --> 35:00.628
Oh, you remembered.

35:00.629 --> 35:02.837
I still can't believe
you've never ridden a horse.

35:02.838 --> 35:05.545
Have you seen a horse?
They're terrifying.

35:05.546 --> 35:07.461
I practically learned
how to ride

35:07.462 --> 35:09.712
before I learned how to walk.

35:09.713 --> 35:12.254
Wow, adventurous
since the beginning.

35:13.878 --> 35:15.961
Maybe you could teach me
how to ride sometime.

35:15.962 --> 35:18.627
I don't think I'm
that good of a teacher.

35:18.628 --> 35:20.711
- Oh!
- Hmm.

35:20.712 --> 35:23.168
- Hey, you, you missed a spot.
- What?

35:23.169 --> 35:24.503
Right there.

35:31.628 --> 35:35.293
So the bathroom is just
down the hall to the left.

35:35.294 --> 35:39.626
But you already know that
because this is your house now.

35:39.627 --> 35:41.003
So...

36:04.584 --> 36:07.250
Ha, cleaned yourself up, I see.

36:07.251 --> 36:10.125
I don't have any to-go cups,
unfortunately.

36:10.126 --> 36:11.791
Oh, you know my pal,
Barb.

36:11.792 --> 36:13.291
Everybody knows Barb.

36:13.292 --> 36:15.083
- Are her and Howard a...
- A thing?

36:15.084 --> 36:16.542
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

36:16.543 --> 36:18.791
Ben's mother died
when he was a kid.

36:18.792 --> 36:21.125
Howard and Barb
started seeing each other

36:21.126 --> 36:23.582
about a year ago, maybe.

36:23.583 --> 36:25.042
And Ben?

36:26.333 --> 36:28.291
He passed away two years ago.

36:29.542 --> 36:30.915
I'm sorry.

36:30.916 --> 36:33.124
Thank you.

36:33.125 --> 36:34.291
It's okay.

36:35.458 --> 36:38.374
The hardest part
is just letting go

36:38.375 --> 36:41.999
of the idea of the life
that we were building.

36:42.000 --> 36:45.083
Because it did not go
as planned.

36:46.000 --> 36:48.332
Life never really does, but...

36:49.749 --> 36:51.540
It's just...

36:51.541 --> 36:52.833
Hard.

36:55.040 --> 36:56.207
Yeah.

37:01.291 --> 37:04.123
I've been thinking about
what you were saying

37:04.124 --> 37:06.789
about not intentionally putting
your mark on things.

37:06.790 --> 37:08.164
- You have?
- Uh-huh.

37:09.623 --> 37:14.205
When you got this place,
it wasn't fixed up, right?

37:14.206 --> 37:15.123
Correct.

37:15.124 --> 37:16.746
And you didn't do a thing to it.

37:16.747 --> 37:18.248
Because you saw potential.

37:20.206 --> 37:22.247
When Ben and I
first got married,

37:22.248 --> 37:24.746
I had this crazy idea

37:24.747 --> 37:26.538
of turnin' this place
into a horse ranch,

37:26.539 --> 37:28.746
because that's what I always
wanted to do.

37:28.747 --> 37:30.288
Well, you must've done well.

37:30.289 --> 37:31.955
I've seen the trophies
in the house.

37:31.956 --> 37:33.246
We did.

37:33.247 --> 37:35.579
Spice was well on his way

37:35.580 --> 37:37.038
to becoming one of the greats.

37:38.580 --> 37:41.329
But horses are like mirrors...

37:41.330 --> 37:45.870
that, uh, reflect whatever
you're feeling...

37:45.871 --> 37:47.371
but amplified.

37:48.122 --> 37:51.246
So, when Ben got sick...

37:54.538 --> 37:57.453
You ever think about
getting back into racing?

37:57.454 --> 38:00.703
I feel weird
talking to you about this.

38:00.704 --> 38:03.577
You don't need to know
about me, and the ranch.

38:03.578 --> 38:05.452
I barely know anything about you

38:05.453 --> 38:07.869
other than the fact
that you're in construction.

38:07.870 --> 38:11.661
Well, I do general
carpentry as well.

38:11.662 --> 38:14.285
And I've always really enjoyed
work with my hands

38:14.286 --> 38:16.202
A natural-born rancher.

38:16.203 --> 38:18.119
I think you gotta teach me
how to ride a horse first.

38:18.120 --> 38:20.245
That'll be my parting gift.

38:21.578 --> 38:23.369
Your job must be hard.

38:23.370 --> 38:25.077
You're always in and out
of hotels.

38:25.078 --> 38:26.827
I mean, what do you
get out of it?

38:26.828 --> 38:29.160
Well, I have
a collection of over 2000

38:29.161 --> 38:30.827
miniature hand soaps.

38:30.828 --> 38:33.576
- You're lying.
- No, cross my heart.

38:33.577 --> 38:35.535
Do you even use any of it?

38:35.536 --> 38:36.868
No, no, it's just...

38:36.869 --> 38:38.702
It's a collection.
It's like stamps.

38:38.703 --> 38:40.867
Oh, but they're
lavender-scented.

38:40.868 --> 38:42.826
Exactly, yeah.

38:42.827 --> 38:44.243
I couldn't live like that.

38:44.244 --> 38:46.617
Goodbyes are way too hard.

38:46.618 --> 38:49.201
The last weekend
of sleep-away camp,

38:49.202 --> 38:51.784
I always refused to get
into my parents' car

38:51.785 --> 38:54.409
until every camper had left.

38:54.410 --> 38:57.659
Wait, you just sit there and
watch all your friends leave?

38:57.660 --> 39:00.075
- One by one.
- That sounds awful.

39:00.076 --> 39:01.908
It was.

39:01.909 --> 39:04.951
But, uh, those summers
were my absolute favorite.

39:07.410 --> 39:10.783
I didn't wanna get into
my parents' car because...

39:10.784 --> 39:13.993
I knew that it would mean
that moment was over

39:14.951 --> 39:16.825
and I can never get it back.

39:16.826 --> 39:20.409
But... then you'd never know
what the next moment would be.

39:22.075 --> 39:24.117
I guess I never really
thought of it like that.

39:28.242 --> 39:33.075
The ranch...
that was a great moment.

39:34.783 --> 39:37.198
I just wish
it could've lasted longer.

40:19.614 --> 40:22.238
And just, uh, pet away.

40:26.364 --> 40:29.530
Oh, no. Whoa-whoa.

40:32.364 --> 40:34.862
Oh. Perfect.

40:34.863 --> 40:36.363
I told you she'd be here
any minute.

40:39.279 --> 40:41.237
I am so sorry.

40:41.238 --> 40:43.445
I must have lost track of time,
I never do that.

40:43.446 --> 40:46.446
That's okay. Jake here has been
helping Maddie feed the horses.

40:48.154 --> 40:51.279
This one's Chestnut, right?
She's my favorite.

40:51.280 --> 40:54.070
Well, let's get on
Chestnut then. Thank you.

40:54.071 --> 40:56.653
- Don't worry about it.
- Let's go get your helmet. Hm?

40:56.654 --> 41:00.028
Um, Autumn, can Jake
come riding with us?

41:00.029 --> 41:02.277
- Oh, uh...
- Ah.

41:02.278 --> 41:03.695
Jake doesn't know how.

41:03.696 --> 41:05.611
Wow, she says that like
everyone's born

41:05.612 --> 41:07.570
with some innate ability
or something.

41:08.529 --> 41:11.236
But you're a great teacher.

41:11.237 --> 41:13.152
Maybe you could teach him.

41:14.778 --> 41:17.527
I am a great teacher.

41:17.528 --> 41:19.485
Okay, let's go.

41:19.486 --> 41:20.736
Wait.

41:22.070 --> 41:24.068
How good a teacher are you?

41:24.069 --> 41:27.652
- Okay, one, two, three!
- Two, three!

41:29.027 --> 41:31.068
Okay, hold on tight.

41:31.069 --> 41:32.152
All right!

41:33.027 --> 41:35.068
Whoa, it's really high up here.

41:38.777 --> 41:41.110
- Show off.
- Okay.

41:41.111 --> 41:42.317
Left to go left.

41:42.318 --> 41:43.818
Yeah.

41:43.819 --> 41:45.109
Right to go right.

41:45.110 --> 41:46.943
And then straight back to stop.

41:48.235 --> 41:49.442
Piece of cake.

41:49.443 --> 41:52.817
Maddie, do you wanna show
Jake how we sit?

41:52.818 --> 41:54.775
Uh, back straight.

41:54.776 --> 41:57.110
Knees in. Heels down.

41:58.110 --> 41:59.900
- All right, lead us out.
- Great.

41:59.901 --> 42:01.525
Whoa, whoa, lead us,
lead us out?

42:01.526 --> 42:03.692
That, that's it?
That's the lesson?

42:03.693 --> 42:06.108
Autumn believes in
learning by doing.

42:06.109 --> 42:09.109
Mm-hm.
Follow Maddie, you'll be fine.

42:12.442 --> 42:14.441
Hyah!

42:14.442 --> 42:17.607
Put some pressure. On your legs.
Right to go right.

42:17.608 --> 42:18.983
- Left to go left.
- All right.

42:18.984 --> 42:20.274
Straight back to stop.

42:20.275 --> 42:23.399
Yeah, I got it.

42:30.650 --> 42:32.107
It's all in the hips.

42:32.108 --> 42:33.483
Great.

42:36.774 --> 42:38.190
It's pretty fast.

42:49.565 --> 42:52.898
Oh... Guess my horse
is taking the lead.

42:54.232 --> 42:56.315
Coco knows
where she's going.

42:57.023 --> 42:58.440
But I don't.

43:08.147 --> 43:09.314
Oh, wow.

43:14.814 --> 43:17.188
Pretty great, huh?

43:17.189 --> 43:19.938
But, this is
a secret spot, okay?

43:19.939 --> 43:21.729
So you have to keep it a secret.

43:21.730 --> 43:23.189
Sure.

43:24.231 --> 43:25.938
Actu... Actually, no.

43:25.939 --> 43:29.312
No, you... You guys should
bring people up here.

43:29.313 --> 43:30.813
- What?
- Yeah, well...

43:30.814 --> 43:32.270
Everybody in town
loves the ranch.

43:32.271 --> 43:33.853
Why not invite them up here?

43:33.854 --> 43:36.104
Like, for a party?

43:36.105 --> 43:39.979
I was thinking, like,
a romantic sunset tour ride.

43:39.980 --> 43:44.104
- Ew!
- Or, yeah, sure, a party.

43:44.105 --> 43:45.937
You could rent it out
to weddings, I don't know.

43:45.938 --> 43:47.478
I just, it...

43:47.479 --> 43:49.853
It seems like a shame
to waste this view.

43:49.854 --> 43:52.396
Well, you could do both
or either if you want.

43:53.562 --> 43:54.936
And you're right.

43:54.937 --> 43:57.186
It was a beautiful spot
for a wedding.

44:19.478 --> 44:21.144
Knees in, silly!

44:22.602 --> 44:24.186
They're as far
as they go!

44:25.435 --> 44:27.477
I don't know what it is
about that man.

44:28.811 --> 44:29.936
Yeah.

44:31.061 --> 44:32.768
Is this better?

44:32.769 --> 44:34.601
I guess so.

44:34.602 --> 44:36.602
- All right.
- I like him.

44:38.102 --> 44:40.684
I haven't seen her laugh
like that since...

44:40.685 --> 44:42.227
I was thinking the same thing.

44:43.768 --> 44:45.558
She did great today,
Mrs. Heller.

44:45.559 --> 44:47.433
And again, I am so sorry
for being late.

44:47.434 --> 44:48.767
I, I don't know what happened.

44:48.768 --> 44:50.642
It's okay.
You have a lot on your plate.

44:50.643 --> 44:52.017
Did you you take a look
at the list

44:52.018 --> 44:53.475
of stables that I suggested?

44:53.476 --> 44:55.809
Yes, thank you. She'll start
at Bedford in two weeks.

44:55.810 --> 44:58.183
Oh. I'm happy to hear that.

44:58.184 --> 45:01.308
- I don't want you to leave!
- Oh!

45:01.309 --> 45:03.599
Bedford is a great stable,
Maddie.

45:03.600 --> 45:05.641
You'll see,
you will like the teachers

45:05.642 --> 45:07.100
even more than you like me.

45:07.101 --> 45:10.100
Come on, Maddie.
You'll see Autumn next week.

45:10.101 --> 45:11.558
Bye.

45:17.100 --> 45:20.391
You, uh, really
saved me earlier.

45:20.392 --> 45:22.349
Oh, that, that was nothing.

45:22.350 --> 45:25.265
Well, whatever it was,
thank you.

45:25.266 --> 45:29.723
So, uh, how was your first
riding experience?

45:29.724 --> 45:32.306
It was absolutely terrifying.

45:32.307 --> 45:34.598
But Maddie's right.
You're an excellent teacher.

45:34.599 --> 45:37.181
Well, you're not, uh,
so bad yourself.

45:37.182 --> 45:39.181
Not so bad? I'm amazing!

45:39.182 --> 45:41.847
I got Coco
to walk the entire way.

45:41.848 --> 45:43.598
You-you understand how hard
that was, right?

45:43.599 --> 45:47.056
Oh, yeah, and she only stopped
to graze about, uh, 30 times?

45:47.057 --> 45:48.722
Actually, I would say
it was closer to 40.

45:48.723 --> 45:51.764
So, that's gotta be some kind of
world record right there.

45:51.765 --> 45:53.389
And, you know, if you were 12,

45:53.390 --> 45:55.681
that would've been
an excellent first lesson.

45:55.682 --> 45:58.138
Yeah, my mom is gonna be so
proud of me when I tell her.

45:58.139 --> 45:59.223
Hmm!

46:00.181 --> 46:02.014
You're gonna call her right now?

46:02.973 --> 46:05.638
Yeah. Yeah, I think I am.

46:05.639 --> 46:07.305
- Oh, okay.
- I'm not kidding.

46:07.306 --> 46:10.638
She, she is going to be proud.
You'll see.

46:10.639 --> 46:12.555
Hey, Mom? Hey, it's Jake.

46:15.098 --> 46:16.888
What?

46:16.889 --> 46:19.222
No. Nothing's wrong, Mom.

46:20.138 --> 46:22.639
No, I... I'm at this thing.

46:23.597 --> 46:24.722
Yeah.

46:26.263 --> 46:27.138
Yeah.

46:27.139 --> 46:29.137
I do not like him.

46:29.138 --> 46:30.929
It's not just you,
this whole place

46:30.930 --> 46:34.845
has been a whole lot... smilier
since he showed up.

46:34.846 --> 46:37.262
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

46:37.263 --> 46:39.553
Plus, with the sale
and everything,

46:39.554 --> 46:41.762
it's too complicated.

46:41.763 --> 46:44.178
Even though it has been nice
having someone

46:44.179 --> 46:45.595
to help out again.

46:45.596 --> 46:48.095
Which of course he's doing
because it's his house.

46:48.096 --> 46:50.678
You see? Complicated.

46:50.679 --> 46:52.761
You know, if he's in
the business of fixing stuff,

46:52.762 --> 46:56.136
you might as well get him
to do something about this drip.

46:56.137 --> 46:59.427
I'm not gonna put him
to work on my house.

46:59.428 --> 47:01.761
Ah, I thought it was his house.

47:13.594 --> 47:16.385
So, why did you get into
construction?

47:16.386 --> 47:19.218
My dad was always a tinkerer.

47:19.219 --> 47:21.259
He was always
inventing these weird

47:21.260 --> 47:23.259
and interesting contraptions.

47:23.260 --> 47:25.593
When I was a kid
we moved around a lot.

47:25.594 --> 47:28.759
So, it kinda became a constant

47:28.760 --> 47:31.677
to start working
with him... Wrench.

47:32.802 --> 47:35.094
And then I,
well, I never stopped.

47:36.551 --> 47:38.134
You're pretty handy.

47:38.135 --> 47:39.926
Mm, I like to think so.

47:39.927 --> 47:41.175
How did that happen?

47:41.176 --> 47:43.384
Growing up on a farm,
you kind of

47:43.385 --> 47:45.217
learn out of necessity.

47:45.218 --> 47:47.217
There's always more stuff
that needs fixing

47:47.218 --> 47:49.509
than people or time to fix it.

47:49.510 --> 47:51.925
So I just learned my way
around a toolbox.

47:51.926 --> 47:53.467
You just draw the line
at plumbing, huh?

47:53.468 --> 47:56.217
No, I, I could do that.
I just didn't want to.

47:56.218 --> 47:57.550
Here, let me help you.

48:01.717 --> 48:03.383
Thanks.

48:03.384 --> 48:05.842
Yeah. You're welcome.

48:11.925 --> 48:13.425
- Toolbox.
- Yeah.

49:08.839 --> 49:09.963
I put some
extra chocolate

49:09.964 --> 49:11.129
on the croissants today.

49:11.130 --> 49:13.672
- Oh.
- Surprise.

49:13.673 --> 49:15.921
Howard will love it.

49:15.922 --> 49:17.712
Howard does love his chocolate.

49:17.713 --> 49:20.420
- This looks good.
- They sure do.

49:23.421 --> 49:24.754
Coffee?

49:24.755 --> 49:28.212
Hey, here you go. I need
some extra cheese in mine.

49:28.213 --> 49:30.337
Yeah, I want extra chives.

49:30.338 --> 49:31.671
Oh.

49:31.672 --> 49:33.587
Am I interrupting something?

49:33.588 --> 49:36.379
Not at all. Everyone's welcome.

49:36.380 --> 49:38.753
He is welcome, right?

49:38.754 --> 49:41.380
Yeah, he's welcome.

49:43.004 --> 49:46.252
- What's goin' on?
- Oh, Sunday morning breakfast.

49:46.253 --> 49:49.086
A little tradition
here at the ranch.

49:49.087 --> 49:51.878
- Every Sunday?
- Like clockwork.

49:51.879 --> 49:54.295
Grab some eggs.
Make yourself an omelet.

49:56.253 --> 49:57.295
Sure.

49:59.920 --> 50:01.669
This is nice.

50:01.670 --> 50:02.919
I can't remember the last time

50:02.920 --> 50:04.460
I had a home-cooked meal
like this.

50:04.461 --> 50:05.962
Mm, it was good.

50:08.795 --> 50:11.585
Hey, do you wanna go
for a walk with me?

50:11.586 --> 50:12.961
And the horses?

50:14.086 --> 50:15.586
With me and the horses.

50:16.794 --> 50:18.127
That would be nice.

50:19.835 --> 50:20.961
Great.

50:23.835 --> 50:25.169
Coco.

50:32.710 --> 50:35.709
- Hey, you're doing great.
- Okay.

50:35.710 --> 50:38.542
- Whoa, whoa. What... Back...
- Oh.

50:38.543 --> 50:39.750
That's an interesting move.

50:39.751 --> 50:41.875
No, I just wanted to go
that way.

50:41.876 --> 50:43.293
Whoa, Coco.

50:44.126 --> 50:46.333
Okay. We're back on track.

50:46.334 --> 50:48.542
- You ready?
- Back on track.

50:49.584 --> 50:50.876
This is great.

51:14.249 --> 51:16.582
So, what do you think?

51:16.583 --> 51:18.499
It's beautiful, huh?

51:18.500 --> 51:21.957
I'll, uh, have to show you all
my secret spots before I leave.

51:21.958 --> 51:23.581
You know, I don't think
that I have ever been

51:23.582 --> 51:25.207
in a place long enough to find

51:25.208 --> 51:26.707
all of its best spots.

51:28.374 --> 51:30.082
Why did your family move
so much?

51:30.083 --> 51:34.081
My dad, he was always moving
from one job to another.

51:34.082 --> 51:38.165
Ah, so the apple doesn't fall
far from the tree, does it?

51:39.165 --> 51:41.247
I guess not.

51:41.248 --> 51:44.414
Look, Autumn, I, uh,
I need to tell you something.

51:44.415 --> 51:46.081
I never...

51:46.082 --> 51:47.456
What's up?

51:50.706 --> 51:53.246
When we first met, uh,
it was just

51:53.247 --> 51:56.038
briefly in the stables.

51:56.039 --> 51:58.789
I remember.

51:58.790 --> 52:01.872
I never thought that this place
would be so wonderful.

52:04.789 --> 52:06.789
Or that you would be so...

52:09.206 --> 52:10.997
That you would be so...

52:14.081 --> 52:15.579
I've gotta go.

52:15.580 --> 52:18.746
I remembered I have a riding
lesson this afternoon.

52:18.747 --> 52:20.747
- Wait. What?
- I, I'm sorry.

52:33.205 --> 52:36.161
Hi, Blackwell Stables?

52:36.162 --> 52:40.287
Hi, um, it's Autumn Carlisle
of Carlisle Ranch.

52:41.204 --> 52:43.287
I, I got a letter...

52:44.870 --> 52:46.745
Oh, you sent...

52:47.954 --> 52:49.412
Great.

52:51.912 --> 52:53.662
Wednesday afternoon works.

52:54.745 --> 52:58.912
Okay, I'll see you then.
Thanks, bye.

53:44.701 --> 53:45.825
Autumn...

53:47.951 --> 53:49.824
What's wrong?

53:49.825 --> 53:51.159
Nothing.

54:05.908 --> 54:07.950
How did you...

54:09.866 --> 54:12.907
When Ben's mom passed away,

54:12.908 --> 54:14.450
how did you move on?

54:15.325 --> 54:18.491
I didn't... for a long time.

54:20.449 --> 54:24.907
I was so focused
on making sure Ben was okay,

54:24.908 --> 54:28.406
and then I got used to it
being the two of us.

54:28.407 --> 54:30.573
One day I woke up...

54:30.574 --> 54:32.781
Ben had grown,

54:32.782 --> 54:35.906
and I realized I'd put
my entire life on hold.

54:35.907 --> 54:38.282
But how did you get
from there to here?

54:40.323 --> 54:41.865
Put yourself out there?

54:42.698 --> 54:44.739
Make yourself vulnerable

54:44.740 --> 54:46.572
only to get left again?

54:46.573 --> 54:49.905
Oh, Autumn,
Ben didn't leave you.

54:49.906 --> 54:53.280
I see him every day in the way
that you smile...

54:53.281 --> 54:55.613
in your sense of humor...

54:55.614 --> 54:57.489
and the way you have
with horses.

54:59.073 --> 55:03.738
Ben may not be here anymore,
but he's always with us.

55:03.739 --> 55:06.529
It was when he met you,
that I realized

55:06.530 --> 55:08.529
what I'd been missing.

55:08.530 --> 55:10.655
That I'd been going through
the motions of life

55:10.656 --> 55:13.071
without really living it.

55:13.072 --> 55:14.654
I know what you mean.

55:14.655 --> 55:16.528
Take it from this old fart.

55:16.529 --> 55:18.529
That's not living.

55:19.780 --> 55:23.820
I just... can't imagine
not loving him anymore.

55:23.821 --> 55:25.904
You don't have to.

55:25.905 --> 55:27.946
You, Miss Carlisle,

55:27.947 --> 55:30.278
have a very big heart.

55:30.279 --> 55:32.320
And for the past couple
of years, I've watched you

55:32.321 --> 55:34.903
make those around you
whole again

55:34.904 --> 55:37.987
but you forgot to do
the same thing for yourself.

55:39.363 --> 55:42.361
One day, you'll wake up
and you'll put one foot

55:42.362 --> 55:45.569
in front of the other
just like every other day,

55:45.570 --> 55:48.235
except this time you'll realize

55:48.236 --> 55:52.444
you're ready to let someone
make your heart whole again.

55:52.445 --> 55:55.570
Just don't wait 20 years
like I did.

56:59.233 --> 57:01.732
You sign this and lot one

57:01.733 --> 57:05.024
of the ranch is officially
off your hands.

57:05.025 --> 57:08.315
And already showing
a major profit.

57:08.316 --> 57:11.274
You are quite
the businessman, Mr. Stevens.

57:17.066 --> 57:18.981
What if I wanna change the plan?

57:18.982 --> 57:21.774
You mean, like,
move the hot tub over?

57:22.899 --> 57:25.023
No, not quite.

57:25.024 --> 57:26.522
If I don't sign this,
is it too late

57:26.523 --> 57:28.190
to back out of the sale
with Autumn?

57:28.191 --> 57:30.315
Or, at least, back out halfway?

57:31.899 --> 57:33.607
I don't understand.

57:34.607 --> 57:35.774
Right.

57:38.565 --> 57:40.689
I wanna go into business
with her.

57:43.773 --> 57:45.689
I wanna build
a bed and breakfast.

57:49.439 --> 57:50.730
But you flip houses.

57:50.731 --> 57:52.939
Yeah, well, I don't wanna
flip this one.

57:52.940 --> 57:54.396
Ever since I walked
in this house,

57:54.397 --> 57:57.355
I just... I can't
get it out of my head.

57:57.356 --> 57:59.396
And I've seen the way
Autumn does business.

57:59.397 --> 58:01.188
Yeah, she's struggling
financially,

58:01.189 --> 58:03.521
but she's incredible.

58:03.522 --> 58:07.313
Everyone loves her.
Clients, her employees.

58:07.314 --> 58:09.437
Just her business is too small

58:09.438 --> 58:11.688
for this big piece of land,
but this...

58:13.229 --> 58:16.187
I think this is the business
that can save her.

58:16.188 --> 58:18.771
Have you talked to Autumn
about this?

58:18.772 --> 58:20.395
No. Not yet.

58:20.396 --> 58:23.646
I just, I guess I wanted to see
if it was possible first.

58:27.396 --> 58:29.938
Okay. I can't see why not.

58:31.146 --> 58:32.895
It would be a different
kinda sale.

58:32.896 --> 58:35.395
I could draw up some paperwork.

58:36.437 --> 58:38.728
Talk to Autumn. Let me know.

58:38.729 --> 58:42.312
Well, that's,
that's my next stop.

58:43.145 --> 58:44.312
Thank you.

58:47.770 --> 58:49.811
Hey, Barb,
thanks for the coffee.

59:04.519 --> 59:07.976
Hey, Howard. Is Autumn around?

59:07.977 --> 59:10.726
She's running errands in town.

59:10.727 --> 59:13.226
Is there anything
I can help you with?

59:13.227 --> 59:16.477
Uh, no. Thanks, though.

59:19.393 --> 59:20.310
Come on.

59:36.267 --> 59:38.391
Jake?

59:38.392 --> 59:40.142
- Hey!
- Hey!

59:41.267 --> 59:42.933
Hey, you're buying grass seed.

59:42.934 --> 59:46.099
Yeah, I kinda let the horses
ruin the look.

59:46.100 --> 59:48.266
Don't wanna leave it all
a mess for the next guy.

59:48.267 --> 59:51.016
Well, lucky for you, I hear
the next guy is pretty handy.

59:51.017 --> 59:53.058
Really? And where'd
you hear that?

59:53.059 --> 59:55.683
Well, news travels fast
in a small town.

59:58.975 --> 01:00:01.891
So, are you
getting anything or...

01:00:01.892 --> 01:00:03.475
Yes, yeah!

01:00:04.808 --> 01:00:06.682
Here it is. Yeah.

01:00:06.683 --> 01:00:08.183
Finally.

01:00:09.641 --> 01:00:11.641
Hm. Yeah.

01:00:12.515 --> 01:00:14.514
Hey, um, do you mind putting

01:00:14.515 --> 01:00:16.223
some of these
up with the others?

01:00:16.224 --> 01:00:19.098
- Sure. No problem.
- Thanks.

01:00:19.099 --> 01:00:20.723
Sunset tours?

01:00:20.724 --> 01:00:22.556
That sounds like a good idea.

01:00:22.557 --> 01:00:25.098
Uh, it's, uh, my farewell tour.

01:00:25.807 --> 01:00:27.140
Thank you.

01:00:28.140 --> 01:00:31.222
Hey, wait. Would you, um...

01:00:31.223 --> 01:00:35.806
um... have dinner with me
tonight?

01:00:37.265 --> 01:00:39.639
I've got
another business proposition

01:00:39.640 --> 01:00:41.473
I wanna talk to you about.

01:00:42.848 --> 01:00:44.764
- I'll cook.
- Uh...

01:00:44.765 --> 01:00:48.055
Uh-uh, most of my kitchenware
is already packed.

01:00:48.056 --> 01:00:50.014
So we'll do something simple.

01:00:52.889 --> 01:00:54.388
Okay.

01:00:54.389 --> 01:00:58.181
Actually,
I can't go. I...

01:01:00.513 --> 01:01:02.721
Never mind. Dinner's great.

01:01:02.722 --> 01:01:05.930
All right. Great,
I'll... see you tonight.

01:01:05.931 --> 01:01:07.638
- Okay. See ya.
- Cool.

01:01:09.430 --> 01:01:10.513
Bye.

01:01:21.721 --> 01:01:24.345
Hi, uh, Blackwell Stables?

01:01:24.346 --> 01:01:27.386
Uh, hi, it's Autumn Carlisle.

01:01:27.387 --> 01:01:30.261
Ah, um, I'm afraid
something's come up

01:01:30.262 --> 01:01:32.638
and I'm not gonna be able
to make it today.

01:01:34.429 --> 01:01:37.387
Okay. Thank you.

01:01:57.261 --> 01:01:59.052
Hey. Hey, hey, hey.

01:01:59.053 --> 01:02:01.885
What's goin' on, guys?

01:02:01.886 --> 01:02:04.635
You feel a storm brewin'?

01:02:04.636 --> 01:02:08.427
Oh... Oh, you big babies.

01:02:09.177 --> 01:02:12.343
Don't worry. I promise.

01:02:12.344 --> 01:02:14.594
There isn't even a cloud
in the sky.

01:02:17.218 --> 01:02:19.092
Please be good.

01:02:19.093 --> 01:02:21.842
For once,
I actually got something

01:02:21.843 --> 01:02:23.551
to get ready for tonight.

01:02:34.301 --> 01:02:36.343
Storm?

01:02:38.468 --> 01:02:41.134
What were those horses
talking about?

01:02:43.759 --> 01:02:45.134
Hm.

01:02:55.467 --> 01:02:57.549
Slim pickings.

01:03:04.716 --> 01:03:06.799
It is a business meeting.

01:03:31.256 --> 01:03:34.088
Hello. Hey.

01:03:34.089 --> 01:03:35.464
Hey.

01:03:35.465 --> 01:03:37.380
Hope you don't mind,
the door was unlocked,

01:03:37.381 --> 01:03:38.505
so I just let myself in.

01:03:38.506 --> 01:03:41.173
Oh, no.
I-I knew you were coming.

01:03:42.381 --> 01:03:44.839
Oh, I-I got you these.

01:03:47.380 --> 01:03:49.504
I thought this was
a business meeting.

01:03:49.505 --> 01:03:53.588
Oh, I just, I thought
it'd be nice, so...

01:03:53.589 --> 01:03:56.755
- Thanks.
- Wow, you look...

01:03:56.756 --> 01:03:58.713
- Clean?
- ...beautiful.

01:03:59.713 --> 01:04:01.212
It's amazing what a lack of mud

01:04:01.213 --> 01:04:02.379
will do to a person.

01:04:02.380 --> 01:04:03.630
Hmm.

01:04:05.213 --> 01:04:08.378
Uh, seems like
it's gonna rain out there.

01:04:08.379 --> 01:04:11.879
Funny, the horses said that too.

01:04:11.880 --> 01:04:13.795
Uh, they were nervous

01:04:13.796 --> 01:04:16.295
which usually means
it's gonna rain.

01:04:16.296 --> 01:04:19.253
- Mm-hmm.
- They're very perceptive.

01:04:19.254 --> 01:04:21.338
Right. So I hear.

01:04:22.712 --> 01:04:25.086
So what're you gonna make?

01:04:25.087 --> 01:04:27.753
- Pasta.
- Hmm. Okay.

01:04:27.754 --> 01:04:30.377
That is, if you still have
some pots and pans out.

01:04:30.378 --> 01:04:32.377
Uh, yeah.

01:04:34.795 --> 01:04:36.253
Which one?

01:04:37.128 --> 01:04:39.086
- Both.
- Okay.

01:04:40.462 --> 01:04:44.710
So... tell me about this,
uh, business proposal.

01:04:44.711 --> 01:04:47.960
We'll get to that.
But now, we have to make dinner.

01:04:47.961 --> 01:04:49.835
We?

01:04:49.836 --> 01:04:52.293
You said you were gonna cook.

01:04:52.294 --> 01:04:55.210
Yeah. And I need a sous-chef.

01:04:56.003 --> 01:04:58.377
So, cut these tomatoes.

01:05:01.127 --> 01:05:02.418
Okay.

01:05:06.377 --> 01:05:08.667
I see you didn't get
organic ones.

01:05:08.668 --> 01:05:10.960
Yeah. It's...

01:05:15.085 --> 01:05:16.417
Yeah.

01:05:31.335 --> 01:05:33.626
Hey, what about potato meringue?

01:05:53.208 --> 01:05:55.458
All right, so, just leave that
for ten minutes.

01:06:01.041 --> 01:06:02.956
Wow!

01:06:02.957 --> 01:06:05.749
I guess the horses were right
about the storm.

01:06:17.999 --> 01:06:20.247
So, when you stopped racing,

01:06:20.248 --> 01:06:23.372
did you ever think of doing
something else with the ranch?

01:06:23.373 --> 01:06:27.039
Um, I boarded other horses
for a while,

01:06:27.040 --> 01:06:29.164
and then I started
giving riding lessons

01:06:29.165 --> 01:06:31.497
which I hadn't done before.

01:06:31.498 --> 01:06:36.496
Right. Now, I think I meant
something totally different.

01:06:36.497 --> 01:06:39.872
Like the world's largest
hay maze?

01:06:39.873 --> 01:06:42.873
- What?
- Never mind.

01:06:44.748 --> 01:06:47.954
I guess I was always
kind of horse-minded.

01:06:47.955 --> 01:06:49.246
That was the dream, you know?

01:06:49.247 --> 01:06:50.580
No, I know you always do

01:06:50.581 --> 01:06:53.288
what's best
for the horses but...

01:06:53.289 --> 01:06:55.621
You know,
I've seen you with people,

01:06:55.622 --> 01:06:56.954
and I think there's something

01:06:56.955 --> 01:06:58.996
so much more that you can do
with that here.

01:06:58.997 --> 01:07:00.954
I don't know that there is.

01:07:00.955 --> 01:07:03.954
You know,
when we first built the ranch,

01:07:03.955 --> 01:07:06.413
I felt like I could do anything.

01:07:07.622 --> 01:07:11.203
Then I lost Ben
and possibilities

01:07:11.204 --> 01:07:15.204
kept getting farther
and farther away.

01:07:17.454 --> 01:07:20.579
This place is too big
for one person.

01:07:21.704 --> 01:07:24.245
It's exhausting
trying to keep up.

01:07:25.370 --> 01:07:27.494
Yeah.

01:07:27.495 --> 01:07:28.869
Yeah, I guess
I-I couldn't imagine

01:07:28.870 --> 01:07:31.286
losing somebody like that.

01:07:31.287 --> 01:07:33.203
I couldn't either.

01:07:35.661 --> 01:07:37.619
Do you...

01:07:37.620 --> 01:07:39.912
Do you ever wanna
find love again?

01:07:41.078 --> 01:07:44.327
"Get back on the horse,"
as they say.

01:07:44.328 --> 01:07:46.201
Do you?

01:07:46.202 --> 01:07:49.035
Not necessarily
get back on the horse

01:07:49.036 --> 01:07:52.327
but get on it at all?

01:07:52.328 --> 01:07:54.910
What makes you think
that I've never been on it?

01:07:54.911 --> 01:07:58.868
Hm, sounds like you're never in
a place long enough to do that.

01:07:58.869 --> 01:08:01.284
- I was engaged once.
- Really?

01:08:01.285 --> 01:08:03.326
Yeah, to my college girlfriend.

01:08:03.327 --> 01:08:04.743
Why'd you break up?

01:08:04.744 --> 01:08:07.992
Well, I just, I started
travelling more with work.

01:08:07.993 --> 01:08:09.992
Ah, she wasn't a mini-soap fan.

01:08:09.993 --> 01:08:11.618
Hm, no.

01:08:11.619 --> 01:08:14.326
No, she was a fan
of my roommate.

01:08:14.327 --> 01:08:15.783
She fell in love with him
instead.

01:08:15.784 --> 01:08:17.533
- Seriously?
- Mm-hmm.

01:08:17.533 --> 01:08:19.283
They're married six years now.

01:08:19.285 --> 01:08:21.118
I think they just had
their second baby.

01:08:22.408 --> 01:08:24.366
That sounds awful. I'm sorry.

01:08:24.367 --> 01:08:25.366
No, no. It's...

01:08:25.367 --> 01:08:27.450
That's fine. I wasn't ready.

01:08:27.451 --> 01:08:30.826
And we're actually, we're much
closer now than we were then.

01:08:32.283 --> 01:08:35.366
Do you think you'll ever
get back on the horse?

01:08:35.367 --> 01:08:38.616
Or... do you want to?

01:08:38.617 --> 01:08:40.782
Yeah.

01:08:40.783 --> 01:08:43.033
I'd like to find that true love.

01:08:45.700 --> 01:08:47.491
I think...

01:08:49.700 --> 01:08:53.408
I want... that again, too.

01:09:13.198 --> 01:09:16.031
Okay.

01:09:17.616 --> 01:09:20.072
Right. Now, where were we?

01:09:20.073 --> 01:09:23.156
Uh, true love,

01:09:23.157 --> 01:09:25.488
moving on, staying put.

01:09:25.488 --> 01:09:27.823
Right. All the easy stuff.

01:09:28.698 --> 01:09:30.697
This is easy.

01:09:30.698 --> 01:09:32.779
What's that?

01:09:32.781 --> 01:09:34.488
Talking with you.

01:09:35.698 --> 01:09:37.529
Autumn, I need to
tell you something.

01:09:39.488 --> 01:09:40.946
Uh...

01:09:40.947 --> 01:09:43.156
One second. Sorry.

01:09:46.197 --> 01:09:47.529
Hello.

01:09:47.529 --> 01:09:48.571
Hey, are you all right?

01:09:48.572 --> 01:09:50.029
I tried calling the house.

01:09:50.031 --> 01:09:52.654
- Yeah, the power is out.
- Figures.

01:09:52.654 --> 01:09:55.195
You have a flashlight,
candles, canned goods?

01:09:55.196 --> 01:09:58.862
Yeah, I'm all set.
And Jake's keeping me company.

01:09:58.863 --> 01:10:00.695
Actually, that's why I called.

01:10:00.696 --> 01:10:02.988
Barb has something to tell you.

01:10:05.071 --> 01:10:07.237
Hi, sweetie. It's about Jake.

01:10:07.238 --> 01:10:09.112
He's flipping the ranch.

01:10:09.113 --> 01:10:12.320
He bought the place
to split off into pieces.

01:10:12.321 --> 01:10:14.320
He's not stickin' around,
Autumn.

01:10:14.321 --> 01:10:16.779
He's selling
to the highest bidder.

01:10:17.820 --> 01:10:19.612
Uh, that's not possible.

01:10:19.613 --> 01:10:23.777
I just saw him talking to the
real estate agent this morning.

01:10:23.778 --> 01:10:26.944
I'm sorry, sweetie,
I thought about not telling you,

01:10:26.945 --> 01:10:29.194
leaving it be...

01:10:29.195 --> 01:10:32.486
Um, thank you
for letting me know.

01:10:34.069 --> 01:10:36.527
Stay safe, okay?

01:10:36.528 --> 01:10:40.153
Uh, I-I will.
Thank you. You too.

01:10:47.028 --> 01:10:48.735
Jake...

01:10:48.736 --> 01:10:52.027
why have you been so helpful
lately?

01:10:52.028 --> 01:10:53.484
Fixing this and that,

01:10:53.485 --> 01:10:56.651
offering me business ideas.

01:10:56.652 --> 01:10:59.443
I'm moving out in a week.
It doesn't make sense.

01:10:59.444 --> 01:11:01.026
I'm glad
you brought this up actually

01:11:01.027 --> 01:11:02.568
because this is what
I've been trying to tell you...

01:11:02.569 --> 01:11:05.359
That you're flipping
my property?

01:11:05.360 --> 01:11:06.775
What? No.

01:11:06.776 --> 01:11:08.442
That's what you're doing,
isn't it?

01:11:08.443 --> 01:11:09.692
No, it's-it's not. I swear.

01:11:09.693 --> 01:11:12.192
That's why you bought my ranch?

01:11:12.193 --> 01:11:14.525
To do exactly what you always do

01:11:14.526 --> 01:11:17.150
which is come in, make it better

01:11:17.151 --> 01:11:18.859
and then take off! I...

01:11:18.860 --> 01:11:20.692
It is so obvious now.

01:11:20.693 --> 01:11:22.108
I can't believe I didn't see it.

01:11:22.109 --> 01:11:24.317
Look, it-it was what
I was gonna do at first

01:11:24.318 --> 01:11:26.317
but I-I don't want that anymore.

01:11:26.318 --> 01:11:27.566
I wanna stay here with you.

01:11:27.567 --> 01:11:29.524
You don't know
anything about me!

01:11:29.525 --> 01:11:31.816
Autumn, wait.

01:11:31.817 --> 01:11:34.816
- Where're you going?
- To check on my horses.

01:11:34.817 --> 01:11:37.859
Autumn, wait! Come back.

01:11:43.191 --> 01:11:44.690
Hey! Hey, boy.

01:11:44.691 --> 01:11:47.690
Hey, it's just a little bit
of noise. I know it's loud.

01:11:47.691 --> 01:11:50.441
Hey, can you, uh, get me
a blanket, please?

01:11:52.191 --> 01:11:55.356
- Shh.
- Here. Just be careful, okay?

01:11:55.357 --> 01:11:57.481
I'm just gonna put this on you,
okay, boy?

01:11:57.482 --> 01:11:59.023
Listen, Autumn...

01:11:59.024 --> 01:12:02.064
Look, I'm sorry I didn't tell
you I... I was planning...

01:12:02.065 --> 01:12:05.148
Jake, look, we will be
out of here in less than a week,

01:12:05.149 --> 01:12:08.189
so just leave us alone
till then!

01:12:11.523 --> 01:12:14.065
Shh, shh. It's okay.

01:12:14.815 --> 01:12:17.565
It's okay.

01:12:20.023 --> 01:12:22.231
Shh.

01:12:41.480 --> 01:12:44.188
Hey, guys.

01:12:45.397 --> 01:12:46.479
Good morning.

01:12:56.188 --> 01:12:57.187
Hi.

01:12:57.188 --> 01:12:59.104
Did you sleep here last night?

01:12:59.105 --> 01:13:00.353
Yeah.

01:13:00.354 --> 01:13:03.978
The horses were afraid
of the storm.

01:13:03.979 --> 01:13:06.520
So, where's Jake?

01:13:06.521 --> 01:13:09.145
I don't wanna
talk about that yet.

01:13:09.146 --> 01:13:10.437
Oh, no.

01:13:10.438 --> 01:13:12.478
Guess that means
your date didn't go too well.

01:13:12.479 --> 01:13:15.686
It wasn't a date.

01:13:15.687 --> 01:13:17.352
He's flipping the ranch.

01:13:17.353 --> 01:13:20.562
Gonna turn it into
a bunch of smaller houses.

01:13:21.562 --> 01:13:23.978
What? Why?

01:13:25.687 --> 01:13:28.520
Business. I...

01:13:49.852 --> 01:13:53.060
I wanna get out of here.

01:14:02.351 --> 01:14:03.726
Why would he hang out
here so much

01:14:03.727 --> 01:14:05.475
if he never planned
on sticking around?

01:14:05.476 --> 01:14:09.225
I have no idea. I tried to wrap
my head around it all night.

01:14:09.226 --> 01:14:11.642
- Keep?
- Donate.

01:14:11.643 --> 01:14:14.850
I can't imagine a stranger
living in my house.

01:14:14.851 --> 01:14:16.683
Hmm, that is weird
to think about.

01:14:16.684 --> 01:14:18.309
It won't be recognizable

01:14:18.310 --> 01:14:21.017
when Jake's done with it,
but still...

01:14:21.018 --> 01:14:23.349
When I thought that
he was gonna be living here,

01:14:23.350 --> 01:14:26.516
it felt like I was leaving
the ranch to a friend.

01:14:26.517 --> 01:14:29.266
Someone to take care of it
or something.

01:14:29.267 --> 01:14:32.016
- I know that sounds stupid.
- No, it doesn't.

01:14:32.017 --> 01:14:34.182
It's just four walls
and a plot of land.

01:14:34.183 --> 01:14:36.182
You know
that it's much more than that.

01:14:36.183 --> 01:14:38.391
To us.

01:14:38.392 --> 01:14:41.224
Speaking of, can you take care
of the horses this weekend?

01:14:41.225 --> 01:14:43.390
- Anything you need. Why?
- Uh...

01:14:43.391 --> 01:14:45.307
I'm gonna drive up
to some ranches.

01:14:45.308 --> 01:14:48.515
Check out some stables
and some living quarters.

01:14:48.516 --> 01:14:52.265
Should've done that ages ago
but, for a while there,

01:14:52.266 --> 01:14:56.223
felt like
I wasn't actually gonna leave.

01:14:56.224 --> 01:14:58.514
Yeah, I know what you mean.

01:14:58.515 --> 01:15:00.514
Oh, shoot!

01:15:00.515 --> 01:15:02.806
Maddie has a lesson on Saturday.

01:15:02.807 --> 01:15:04.056
Don't worry about it.

01:15:04.057 --> 01:15:05.598
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

01:15:05.599 --> 01:15:07.806
Now, go and see
what your future has in store.

01:15:07.807 --> 01:15:10.097
- I hear it's big and fancy.
- Hmm.

01:15:10.098 --> 01:15:12.015
State of the art.

01:15:12.890 --> 01:15:13.764
Keep.

01:15:14.473 --> 01:15:15.930
Okay, are you sure

01:15:15.931 --> 01:15:17.347
you're good with me leaving?

01:15:17.348 --> 01:15:20.390
Go on. Have fun. I got this.

01:15:21.181 --> 01:15:22.723
Okay.

01:15:24.306 --> 01:15:26.221
Call me if you need anything.

01:15:26.222 --> 01:15:29.014
We'll be fine.
You trained me well. I promise.

01:15:29.015 --> 01:15:31.513
Okay. Thank you.
I'll see you soon.

01:15:31.514 --> 01:15:33.014
- Bye.
- Bye.

01:15:35.139 --> 01:15:37.847
See ya!

01:16:19.178 --> 01:16:21.595
What're you doing here?

01:16:23.053 --> 01:16:25.011
Where's Autumn?

01:16:25.012 --> 01:16:28.012
I'm not at liberty to say.
Hey!

01:16:28.678 --> 01:16:31.260
Stop helping.

01:16:31.261 --> 01:16:35.051
Put that down
or I will sic this horse on you.

01:16:35.052 --> 01:16:36.720
She's vicious.

01:16:38.719 --> 01:16:40.719
When's Autumn coming back?

01:16:42.927 --> 01:16:44.510
Monday.

01:16:50.719 --> 01:16:52.177
Hi.

01:16:54.343 --> 01:16:55.594
What can I say?

01:16:57.968 --> 01:16:59.718
Horses love me.

01:17:03.010 --> 01:17:04.468
Traitor.

01:17:06.759 --> 01:17:08.176
Come on.

01:17:19.842 --> 01:17:21.925
This is nice.

01:18:22.839 --> 01:18:24.171
What's he doing?

01:18:24.172 --> 01:18:27.629
He is building his way
into Autumn's heart.

01:18:27.630 --> 01:18:29.504
I hate to break it
to you, Chloe,

01:18:29.505 --> 01:18:33.046
but I'm pretty sure
he's already there.

01:18:33.047 --> 01:18:36.254
You know, for a little girl,
you're very perceptive.

01:18:37.881 --> 01:18:40.254
Come on, we've got to shift
the saddle off Chestnut.

01:19:53.210 --> 01:19:56.251
Oh. Oh, all right.

01:19:56.252 --> 01:19:58.126
Here.

01:19:58.127 --> 01:19:59.834
- We don't have any to-go...
- To-go cups.

01:19:59.835 --> 01:20:03.501
Yes. I, uh, I was made aware.

01:20:08.251 --> 01:20:10.293
Why are you doing this?

01:20:12.167 --> 01:20:16.167
Well, because I, uh...

01:20:17.417 --> 01:20:21.166
It's just, I...

01:20:21.166 --> 01:20:24.083
Yeah. I kinda thought you might.

01:20:54.874 --> 01:20:56.998
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:20:56.999 --> 01:20:59.789
Look, I'm sorry,
I know I promised

01:20:59.790 --> 01:21:02.622
not to touch the gazebo, but...

01:21:02.623 --> 01:21:05.039
I also know how much
it means to you.

01:21:05.040 --> 01:21:07.289
I couldn't leave it
the way it was.

01:21:07.290 --> 01:21:08.497
I used the same wood.

01:21:08.498 --> 01:21:09.706
I painted the same color
that it was...

01:21:09.707 --> 01:21:12.664
What is Carlisle
Bed and Breakfast?

01:21:12.665 --> 01:21:15.582
Chloe found your building plans.

01:21:18.164 --> 01:21:20.706
That was
my business proposition.

01:21:22.581 --> 01:21:26.038
Autumn,
you can't close the ranch.

01:21:26.039 --> 01:21:29.455
It makes so many people happy
but especially you.

01:21:30.330 --> 01:21:32.246
And you're right, it-it's,

01:21:32.247 --> 01:21:34.329
it's too big for one person.

01:21:34.330 --> 01:21:36.538
So what? You're just gonna
move yourself in?

01:21:36.539 --> 01:21:38.329
Well, I... I mean

01:21:38.330 --> 01:21:41.163
I was gonna ask first.

01:21:42.496 --> 01:21:46.080
Listen, I can't replace Ben.

01:21:46.830 --> 01:21:48.787
And I'm not asking to.

01:21:48.788 --> 01:21:53.953
But I just see how kind
and generous you are

01:21:53.954 --> 01:21:55.995
with all the people here,
and I got this crazy idea

01:21:55.996 --> 01:21:57.953
that we could open up
a bed and breakfast.

01:21:57.954 --> 01:22:01.161
Because you love hotels so much
you wanna open your own?

01:22:01.162 --> 01:22:03.078
No, because you're kind.

01:22:03.079 --> 01:22:05.703
And you're smart, and because...

01:22:05.704 --> 01:22:08.619
I wanna build something
with you.

01:22:08.620 --> 01:22:12.036
I can't be the reason
why you leave your home.

01:22:13.078 --> 01:22:14.995
But you lied to me.

01:22:16.120 --> 01:22:18.494
I just thought
it was better business.

01:22:18.495 --> 01:22:21.369
So why come clean now?

01:22:21.370 --> 01:22:24.035
Why not just build
your own B and B

01:22:24.036 --> 01:22:25.743
and not split the profit?

01:22:25.744 --> 01:22:28.285
Because...

01:22:28.286 --> 01:22:31.161
it isn't just business
for me anymore.

01:22:34.286 --> 01:22:36.826
If I do this,
and I'm not saying I will,

01:22:36.827 --> 01:22:38.578
but if I do...

01:22:39.827 --> 01:22:42.118
how do I know
that you'll stick around?

01:22:42.119 --> 01:22:44.868
'Cause I see potential.

01:22:44.869 --> 01:22:48.242
And for the first time in my
life, I wanna see this through.

01:22:48.243 --> 01:22:51.993
Whether we're
business partners or...

01:22:51.994 --> 01:22:53.702
friends or...

01:22:55.618 --> 01:22:57.326
whatever else.

01:22:59.909 --> 01:23:02.159
I've got you stuck in my head,
Autumn.

01:23:02.993 --> 01:23:04.491
You're stuck in my head.

01:23:22.242 --> 01:23:26.324
Whoo, baby!
These, uh, look good.

01:23:26.325 --> 01:23:28.574
Oh, wow. Smell that? Oh...

01:23:28.575 --> 01:23:29.949
Smells beautiful.

01:23:29.950 --> 01:23:31.824
That smells fantastic.

01:23:31.825 --> 01:23:34.574
- Oh, I love the...
- Just...

01:23:34.575 --> 01:23:36.740
- Ooh, ooh, ooh, watch out.
- Okay.
