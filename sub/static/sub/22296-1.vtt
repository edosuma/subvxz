Eliza?

00:29.112 --> 00:30.613
[Eliza] I'm thinking
about being vegetarian again.

00:30.697 --> 00:32.156
-Eliza.
-Do you realize eating meat

00:32.240 --> 00:33.742
is worse than driving an SUV
for a year?

00:33.825 --> 00:35.076
-Eliza, am I fitting?
-[horn honks]

00:35.702 --> 00:37.912
-I'm parking, asshole!
-[horn honks]

00:37.996 --> 00:40.206
-I can't believe that's true.
-It's true, Dad.

00:40.290 --> 00:41.458
I'll send you the podcast.

00:41.541 --> 00:43.126
-I don't think I'm fitting.
-I'm telling you,

00:43.209 --> 00:44.836
it's a big thing we can do
for the environment.

00:45.420 --> 00:46.546
Let's look it up.

00:46.629 --> 00:50.216
But not while I'm pulling this maneuver.

00:52.385 --> 00:54.554
-It's too small a space.
-Shit.

00:54.637 --> 00:55.638
[horns honking]

00:55.722 --> 00:56.806
What?

00:57.557 --> 00:59.184
Put the Mets game on.

00:59.267 --> 01:01.394
I splurged and got the satellite.

I put this on a tape for you
when you were, like, 12.

01:20.830 --> 01:21.956
Cool.

01:22.999 --> 01:25.710
Shit! Was that a spot?

01:25.794 --> 01:27.837
-Yeah, he's taking it.
-How did I miss that?

01:27.921 --> 01:29.798
-Fucking shit!
-Just go around.

01:29.881 --> 01:32.258
We've been around.
I'm gonna go further east.

01:32.759 --> 01:34.469
How did I do this wrong?

01:34.552 --> 01:38.515
-It's okay, Dad. We'll just garage it.
-Know how much it is to garage it here?

01:38.598 --> 01:40.683
If we garage it, you can't go to college.

01:40.767 --> 01:43.520
-I'll pay half.
-I'm not taking your money.

01:43.603 --> 01:46.439
What's the matter with me?
I'm usually very good at this.

01:46.523 --> 01:48.775
-It's okay.
-I'm an extremely good parker.

01:48.858 --> 01:50.360
I know.

01:50.443 --> 01:53.196
Now, I'm getting gun-shy.
I'm overthinking it.

01:54.531 --> 01:55.490
-Dad...
-It's hot.

01:55.573 --> 01:58.618
-Wait until we're stopped!
-It's interfering with my mobility.

01:58.701 --> 02:00.662
-Let me help you.
-These the people who were behind us?

02:00.745 --> 02:02.580
-I don't know.
-Keep the jacket right-side up.

02:02.664 --> 02:03.748
My wallet's in there.

02:03.832 --> 02:06.543
-This song is distracting.
-It's too good.

02:07.335 --> 02:08.544
Yeah, it is too good.

02:09.838 --> 02:12.132
There's so much construction
in Manhattan.

02:12.215 --> 02:13.633
They're just endlessly building.

02:14.134 --> 02:17.762
I used to go dancing around here
at Danceteria, me and your Uncle Matthew.

02:17.846 --> 02:19.973
-Now it's all banks.
-You guys went dancing together?

02:20.056 --> 02:22.058
We went together,
we didn't dance together.

02:22.142 --> 02:25.061
For a short time in the '80s,
we hung out.

02:25.145 --> 02:27.147
I had moves, I'm telling you.

02:27.564 --> 02:30.400
Is this a museum now?
Everything's glass.

02:30.483 --> 02:32.694
Do you like the photographer
Cindy Sherman?

02:32.777 --> 02:35.822
Marcus and I went to
the Cindy Sherman show at MoMA last week.

02:35.905 --> 02:37.574
Yes, I like Cindy Sherman.

02:38.283 --> 02:39.159
What?

02:39.242 --> 02:41.202
I told you about Cindy Sherman
two years ago.

02:41.286 --> 02:42.120
I don't remember.

02:42.203 --> 02:44.247
I did, and you had absolutely no interest.

02:44.330 --> 02:45.165
I don't know.

02:45.248 --> 02:47.041
When Marcus tells you,
suddenly you listen?

02:47.500 --> 02:49.586
I'm telling you,
I got good recommendations.

02:49.669 --> 02:52.046
I mean, I have a few years on you.

02:52.130 --> 02:54.507
-Was that a spot? What did the sign say?
-[horn honking]

02:54.591 --> 02:55.675
I'm trying to see.

02:55.758 --> 02:57.594
-Quick, Eliza!
-I find parking signs confusing.

02:57.677 --> 02:59.512
-What's today?
-This asshole's on my tail.

02:59.596 --> 03:01.347
-It was a good space.
-Can I back up?

03:01.431 --> 03:03.933
-I don't think so.
-Shit, he's on my tail.

03:04.976 --> 03:07.770
-I got to go around?
-We should really just garage it.

03:08.271 --> 03:10.440
-Son of a bitch!
-Dad, stop yelling in the car!

03:10.523 --> 03:13.526
He cannot hear you, okay?
Only I can hear you.

03:13.610 --> 03:16.613
Because it's "Nobody can fucking drive
day!" Hey! Shut the fuck up!

03:16.696 --> 03:18.990
Yoo-hoo. Hello!

03:19.073 --> 03:20.241
The outer door was ajar,

03:20.325 --> 03:23.328
and the button on the foyer door
was unlocked and pushed in.

03:23.411 --> 03:24.913
-Something smells weird.
-[dog barks]

03:24.996 --> 03:27.498
-Oh, wow! Hello! Hi!
-Down, Bruno! Bruno, down!

03:27.582 --> 03:28.917
-Whose dog is this?
-Bruno!

03:29.000 --> 03:31.711
Maureen and I bought him
from a very elegant apricot poodle farm

03:31.794 --> 03:32.712
near the country house.

03:32.795 --> 03:34.672
Dad, the outer door was left open,

03:34.756 --> 03:36.966
and someone pressed the button in
on the foyer door.

03:37.050 --> 03:39.219
Maureen is always doing something.
Maureen!

03:39.302 --> 03:41.596
-You got to be more careful.
-Maureen!

03:41.679 --> 03:42.555
Brune! Maureen!

03:42.639 --> 03:46.100
This house isn't very big, but she never
seems to be able to hear me. Maureen!

03:46.184 --> 03:47.477
-This isn't the country.
-What?

03:47.560 --> 03:51.064
-Did you leave the front door open?
-For the Con Ed guy!

03:51.147 --> 03:52.857
-That was three days ago.
-Sorry we're late.

03:52.941 --> 03:54.484
We had to garage the car.

03:54.567 --> 03:56.986
Dad had to sell me into child slavery
to pay for it.

03:57.070 --> 03:59.239
-That's basically right.
-Did you try East?

03:59.322 --> 04:00.406
-Twice.
-We did.

04:00.490 --> 04:02.325
Bruno! He does this elegant pirouette.

04:02.408 --> 04:06.454
Dad... what happened to your face?
Did you get into a fight?

04:06.537 --> 04:07.914
I was walking Bruno in the country

04:07.997 --> 04:11.918
when he lunged for a feral hare
in the brush, and I tumbled forward.

04:12.001 --> 04:14.170
Shit. Did you see a doctor?

04:14.254 --> 04:16.923
I'm fine. My joke is,
"You should see the other dog."

04:17.005 --> 04:18.132
Good one, Grandpa.

04:18.216 --> 04:20.343
Maureen won't even
walk that path anymore.

04:20.426 --> 04:23.429
-She was mauled by a buck.
-A buck in the Berkshires?

04:23.513 --> 04:24.722
A male deer.

04:24.806 --> 04:27.141
-Really?
-Maybe it was a big dog or a small boy.

04:27.225 --> 04:28.851
In her indomitable way,

04:28.935 --> 04:33.398
she survived with just a nasty raspberry
on her knee, but her wallet was gone.

04:34.023 --> 04:36.818
-The Mets have relinquished the lead.
-Shit.

04:36.901 --> 04:39.821
-Your sister's here.
-They were tied when we were in the car.

04:39.904 --> 04:42.490
I could tell Dad wanted to say hi
to you guys by himself.

04:42.573 --> 04:44.701
-When did you get here?
-A couple hours ago.

04:44.784 --> 04:46.536
-Thanks for showing up late.
-Oh, let's...

04:46.619 --> 04:50.248
I made cookies, but I stepped in dog shit.
I like your sweater.

04:50.331 --> 04:52.583
Oh, thanks. I like your pin.

04:52.667 --> 04:55.837
-Are you excited for college tomorrow?
-Yeah, I really can't wait.

04:55.920 --> 04:58.214
Dad keeps saying
he wishes he hadn't retired now

04:58.298 --> 05:00.091
so that you could take his class.

05:00.174 --> 05:02.051
I couldn't make sculptures.
It's too intimidating.

05:02.135 --> 05:04.095
She's very excited,
which I'm trying not to take personally.

05:04.178 --> 05:05.722
I'm bad with transitions.

05:05.805 --> 05:08.474
You don't leave the house.
There are no transitions.

05:09.058 --> 05:10.893
Maureen is plastered.

05:10.977 --> 05:13.271
Maureen, everyone's here! Come down!

05:13.354 --> 05:14.731
Maureen's making shark.

05:15.315 --> 05:17.859
-I don't think I've ever had shark before.
-Maureen's a real gourmand.

05:17.942 --> 05:20.486
-You're in for a treat.
-She's been sober for six weeks.

05:20.570 --> 05:21.487
Oh, okay.

05:21.571 --> 05:23.406
I told her,
"I don't like you when you drink."

05:23.489 --> 05:25.158
She becomes a different person.

05:25.241 --> 05:29.120
I made her a deal. I said,
"If you stop drinking, we'll get a dog."

05:29.203 --> 05:31.122
[tapping]

05:35.501 --> 05:38.004
This is very handsome shellfish, Maureen.

05:38.087 --> 05:41.215
The Dad says
you're gonna study film at college.

05:41.299 --> 05:42.258
Yeah.

05:42.925 --> 05:45.845
Seems to be what everybody's
doing these days.

05:45.928 --> 05:49.766
I think the Dad hoped that you might
follow in his footsteps

05:49.849 --> 05:51.142
and take sculpture.

05:51.225 --> 05:53.853
Well, I think it's good
that she's doing her own thing.

05:53.936 --> 05:57.023
Since Clarence had a stroke and I retired,

05:57.106 --> 06:00.026
the art department at Bard
has really suffered.

06:00.109 --> 06:01.444
She's quite a good editor.

06:02.111 --> 06:05.364
So, now we have a sculptor
and a filmmaker in the family.

06:05.448 --> 06:06.407
And a musician.

06:06.491 --> 06:08.493
And an accountant,
which sounds uninteresting,

06:08.576 --> 06:12.705
but Matthew's the only one in the family
who's figured out how to make money.

06:12.789 --> 06:13.623
Sign of the times.

06:13.706 --> 06:16.125
We're supposed to say
"business manager."

06:16.209 --> 06:18.169
I thought we would've had
more artists in the family.

06:18.753 --> 06:21.089
-What about Dad?
-I'm artistic.

06:21.172 --> 06:23.966
Matthew showed interest in fine art
and Danny had musical talent,

06:24.050 --> 06:27.804
but Matthew was also talented musically
and a wonderful mimic.

06:30.973 --> 06:33.351
Jean, you showed interest in photography.

06:34.977 --> 06:36.187
At Montessori, yeah.

06:36.979 --> 06:41.692
In my office at Xerox,
I'm known as the resident auteur.

06:41.776 --> 06:43.319
I make funny movies.

06:43.903 --> 06:46.614
-For my coworkers' birthdays.
-They're really good.

06:46.697 --> 06:49.408
We have no idea what Jean does at Xerox.

06:49.492 --> 06:53.746
-I'm a facilities manager for special...
-When was the last job you had, Danny?

06:54.413 --> 06:56.833
-Those piano lessons.
-Except for the piano lessons?

06:56.916 --> 06:58.751
And there was that gig
at Beefsteak Charlie's.

06:58.835 --> 07:00.294
I haven't worked in...

07:00.378 --> 07:03.005
-Since Eliza was born.
-Danny was a house husband.

07:03.089 --> 07:05.508
But now with the separation,
he's gonna have to get a job.

07:05.591 --> 07:07.260
You can't take alimony. That's not right.

07:07.343 --> 07:09.178
What will you do for money?

07:09.262 --> 07:12.432
Well, we sold the apartment,
so we'll split that.

07:12.515 --> 07:17.186
And I'll be staying here for a little,
of course, while I figure it out.

07:17.812 --> 07:19.480
-Thank you again.
-While you're staying here,

07:19.564 --> 07:21.566
could you go through
all the boxes upstairs

07:21.649 --> 07:26.779
and take any posters or papers
that you want from your childhood?

07:26.863 --> 07:30.116
Maureen is taking a fancy trip
to Easter Island Monday with a group.

07:30.199 --> 07:32.952
When I come back, we're going to start
throwing things away.

07:33.035 --> 07:35.496
-We lived in Queens with our mom.
-We don't really have anything.

07:35.580 --> 07:37.165
It's mostly Matt's stuff, but okay.

07:37.248 --> 07:39.584
Matthew's coming out from the coast
in a few weeks.

07:39.667 --> 07:42.253
-He corresponded about meeting for lunch.
-Matt is?

07:42.336 --> 07:45.006
He has some wealthy clients
who are coming over Sunday

07:45.089 --> 07:47.300
to look at the Dad's work.

07:47.383 --> 07:50.052
-Matt does?
-Apparently, they're admirers of mine.

07:50.136 --> 07:52.555
We never hear from him,
and then suddenly poof.

07:52.638 --> 07:55.349
That's not true.
Matthew and I correspond quite frequently.

07:55.433 --> 07:56.934
Yeah, he texts with me.

07:57.018 --> 07:58.853
You guys text? About what?

07:58.936 --> 08:01.689
I don't know, things. Life.

08:02.940 --> 08:04.525
Maybe I'll try to see him when he's here.

08:04.609 --> 08:08.070
He's only here for a day to see a client,
he wants to see me during that time.

08:08.154 --> 08:09.530
Eliza, have more shark.

08:09.614 --> 08:11.908
Maureen, give my granddaughter
more shark.

08:11.991 --> 08:12.992
You kids don't eat.

08:13.075 --> 08:15.536
It's amazing how much
Matthew's clients make,

08:15.620 --> 08:19.081
when you think about what a teacher,
or a nurse, or...

08:19.165 --> 08:22.460
I think I would've had greater success
if I had been more fashionable.

08:22.543 --> 08:24.962
Well, you were always out-of-step
with the times.

08:25.046 --> 08:27.840
That's true, I was a vanguard.
L.J. Shapiro said that about me.

08:27.924 --> 08:31.302
You know, L.J.'s having
a retrospective at MoMA.

08:31.385 --> 08:32.511
Is he?

08:32.595 --> 08:34.804
L.J. was always very political.

08:34.889 --> 08:37.558
He's not untalented,
but he's a very skillful operator.

08:37.642 --> 08:38.976
You didn't play the game.

08:39.059 --> 08:41.604
Do you think I should email Matt
about his visit?

08:41.687 --> 08:42.688
Why not?

08:42.772 --> 08:44.190
I don't want to be presumptuous.

08:44.273 --> 08:45.900
He's your brother, Dan.

08:45.983 --> 08:46.859
Half.

08:46.943 --> 08:49.570
Isn't that when the Whitney
bought a piece of yours?

08:49.654 --> 08:51.280
Yes, they were going to buy
more work, too,

08:51.364 --> 08:54.200
but Bernie, my dealer at the time,
didn't like the deal.

08:54.283 --> 08:56.035
I probably shouldn't have listened
to him.

08:56.994 --> 09:00.081
I don't know, he didn't respond
the last time I reached out.

09:00.164 --> 09:03.584
When I called and wrote the Whitney
about it, they couldn't find it.

09:03.668 --> 09:05.378
-It's there.
-They can't find it.

09:05.461 --> 09:08.464
-Jean! Damn it, they have the work!
-Okay.

09:12.552 --> 09:14.011
[whispers] It's lost.

09:14.971 --> 09:16.097
[Eliza's grandfather] Hmm.

09:17.682 --> 09:20.268
The work looks stunning
all together like this.

09:20.351 --> 09:23.896
-Danny, you made this?
-Jean and I did, yes.

09:23.980 --> 09:26.607
Harold Meyerowitz. A Retrospective.

09:26.691 --> 09:30.027
You send in the pictures
and they make it for you.

09:31.112 --> 09:35.575
Oh, Dad, Jean and I spoke to a woman
at the museum at Bard.

09:35.658 --> 09:37.243
-Was that Hilma Federman?
-Hilma, yes.

09:37.326 --> 09:39.704
And there's some interest
in doing a show there.

09:39.787 --> 09:43.666
Oh, that's the least they can do for you,
after all those years you've given them.

09:43.749 --> 09:45.710
I think with Eliza going this fall

09:45.793 --> 09:48.671
and your history as a teacher,
we have a good shot.

09:48.754 --> 09:50.923
Danny, make sure Hilma sees the book.

09:51.591 --> 09:54.093
A retrospective at this point would be
a real feather in my cap,

09:54.176 --> 09:55.886
and I think bring attention
to the new work.

09:56.679 --> 09:59.348
The thing is, Dad,
it would be part of a group show.

09:59.432 --> 10:00.474
Bard faculty.

10:00.558 --> 10:02.435
A group show.
No, that's essentially an insult.

10:02.518 --> 10:05.605
I think Hilma's angry because
I voted against her chairmanship.

10:07.815 --> 10:08.983
Tell Hilma no.

10:09.066 --> 10:12.486
-Well, Hilma hasn't offered it yet.
-When she does, tell her no.

10:14.655 --> 10:16.532
Maureen, where's the gourmet hummus?

10:17.033 --> 10:18.618
It's upstairs, I think.

13:03.866 --> 13:05.117
Or, I imagine you will.

It's okay. She's a good driver.

13:27.139 --> 13:29.558
And I'll be up there
whenever you're ready for me.

13:33.604 --> 13:35.022
Marcus is picking you up.

13:35.648 --> 13:37.942
Does Marcus know to take the tunnel
instead of the bridge?

13:38.025 --> 13:40.152
At this hour,
the bridge is gonna be jammed.

13:40.236 --> 13:41.320
You'll be okay here?

Yeah.

It'll be nice to spend time with Dad

13:46.825 --> 13:49.703
You know, I didn't get
a lot of time with him growing up.

13:49.787 --> 13:52.665
It's an opportunity to get closer now.

13:53.582 --> 13:55.668
It's nice you and Jean
are getting him this show.

13:56.752 --> 13:58.754
I know it's just a college show,

13:58.837 --> 14:01.715
but I think it really could
put him back on the map.

14:01.799 --> 14:04.927
The work is good

You've been a great dad.

14:13.185 --> 14:14.645
I think I still am.

14:39.962 --> 14:40.880
Text when you get...

14:40.963 --> 14:42.298
This one's interesting.

14:42.381 --> 14:44.550
I think it's a masterpiece, Brian.

14:44.633 --> 14:48.137
It's intended as a sort of sequel
to "Gilded Halfwing."

14:48.220 --> 14:50.347
The squiggly one outside Lincoln Center.

14:50.431 --> 14:52.099
Yes, James, "Gilded Halfwing."

14:52.182 --> 14:54.226
It's probably my most well-known work.

14:54.310 --> 14:56.020
It has a young man's energy.

14:56.103 --> 14:59.189
But I like to think
that my later work is richer,

14:59.273 --> 15:00.190
more interesting.

15:00.274 --> 15:01.734
When Matthew told me that was yours,

15:01.817 --> 15:04.111
I was like,
"I walk by there all the time."

15:04.737 --> 15:06.280
We're on Central Park West now,

15:06.363 --> 15:08.824
but have been looking for
the right place downtown.

15:08.908 --> 15:11.535
Show James and Brian
the wood structures.

15:11.619 --> 15:14.246
Yes, I've been working in wood recently.

15:14.330 --> 15:15.748
Danny, give me a hand.

15:15.831 --> 15:18.292
How about this one, with the gold?
Always loved this one.

15:18.375 --> 15:20.628
No, not that one.
It's a minor work of mine.

15:20.711 --> 15:21.837
Over here.

15:22.796 --> 15:24.590
How's the noise in this area?

15:24.673 --> 15:27.259
-It gets very loud, all the tourists.
-Only on weekends.

15:27.343 --> 15:28.802
How long has Matthew been your...

15:28.886 --> 15:30.930
-business manager?
-Hey, Dad, let me help.

15:31.513 --> 15:35.851
[James] He's been doing that for,
I guess it's been close to five years.

15:36.435 --> 15:37.478

15:37.561 --> 15:40.397
We met at a fundraiser for Chuck Schumer.

15:48.572 --> 15:51.283
-Great water pressure.
-The art's over here.

15:51.367 --> 15:52.701
It's largely intuitive, really,

15:52.785 --> 15:55.996
and in its way,
a return to the old masters.

15:57.498 --> 16:00.542
I think I'm doing
the best work of my life right now, but...

16:01.919 --> 16:03.545
that's just one man's opinion.

16:03.629 --> 16:05.798
I found Brian very attractive.

16:05.881 --> 16:10.594
He's baby-faced but sinewy
like an old lover of mine, Willem Dafoe.

16:11.095 --> 16:13.889
And James has very firm hands.

16:13.973 --> 16:15.849
They were very enthusiastic
about the work.

16:15.933 --> 16:17.726
Are they interested in the house
or the art?

16:17.810 --> 16:18.769
-I think the art.
-Both.

16:18.852 --> 16:22.064
What do you mean, "both?" Maureen?
What do you mean "both?"

16:22.147 --> 16:24.817
From Matthew, they're interested
in purchasing all of the work,

16:24.900 --> 16:26.860
some of the furniture,
as well as the house.

16:26.944 --> 16:29.113
The house? What did you tell them?

16:29.196 --> 16:31.573
-We're open to exploring it.
-The Mets are staging a comeback.

16:31.657 --> 16:35.327
-They got first and third with no one out.
-You're thinking about selling, why?

16:35.411 --> 16:37.121
It's very expensive to keep this place up,

16:37.204 --> 16:39.331
and we're spending more time
at the country house now.

16:39.415 --> 16:40.749
But the country's yours.

16:40.833 --> 16:43.961
I had it before we were married,
but it's ours. Everything is ours now.

16:44.044 --> 16:46.422
You're selling all the art, Dad? Why?

16:46.505 --> 16:48.757
-We don't have room for it.
-Do you want to sell?

Oh, come on.
Cabrera just grounded into a double play.

I think it is!

16:55.973 --> 16:57.808
I don't think you should sell,
I'm telling you.

16:57.891 --> 17:01.478
-I didn't expect you to get upset.
-I am! I am upset about it.

17:01.562 --> 17:03.689
-Why do you care?
-I don't know.

17:04.440 --> 17:06.608
-We've lived here for years.
-You haven't.

17:06.692 --> 17:09.278
This is where Matthew grew up.
You lived in Queens with your mother.

17:09.361 --> 17:11.905
I lived here for a year when I was 16.

17:11.989 --> 17:13.615
Your studio's here.

17:14.074 --> 17:15.701
They want all the artwork?

17:15.784 --> 17:19.913
I mean, Dad, with a show here or there,
your work might become valuable.

17:19.997 --> 17:20.914
That is true.

17:21.999 --> 17:23.291
I say no.

17:23.876 --> 17:26.627
Everyone in the family will be consulted
before we sell anything.

17:26.712 --> 17:28.380
Matthew isn't here, you know?

17:28.464 --> 17:31.216
Matthew... isn't in the house now!

17:31.884 --> 17:33.677
It's a Meyerowitz tradition, this house!

17:33.761 --> 17:35.679
Well, I guess I wouldn't know about that.

17:37.389 --> 17:39.224
I didn't mean it like that.

17:39.641 --> 17:42.936
She gets sensitive about these things.
She feels like an outsider.

17:43.020 --> 17:44.563
She doesn't have kids of her own.

17:44.646 --> 17:47.357
I tell her,
"Technically, you're their stepmother."

17:48.192 --> 17:49.818
Take care of the Dad!

17:50.402 --> 17:51.320

What's the news there?

21:18.485 --> 21:20.696
Oh, I didn't know. How are you doing?

21:22.364 --> 21:26.702
Maureen says they're feting you
at MoMA... you and Tim Burton.

21:26.785 --> 21:31.331
Right, Matisse and Picasso, too, sure.
Let's get a lunch one of these days.

21:31.415 --> 21:33.500
Are you still in the West Village?

21:33.583 --> 21:34.710
Brooklyn!

21:35.502 --> 21:36.795
Or to your opening?

21:37.879 --> 21:39.256
I'm coming if you invite me.

21:39.840 --> 21:42.301
Next Friday? Yes, I think I can make it.

21:42.384 --> 21:44.928
Okay, I'll see you then.

21:45.012 --> 21:46.763
That was a strike. Turn it up.

21:46.847 --> 21:47.889
Was that L.J.?

21:48.432 --> 21:49.474
I always liked L.J.

21:49.558 --> 21:52.394
He says he had a prostate surgery
I didn't know about.

21:52.477 --> 21:53.895
And I really like his work.

21:53.979 --> 21:56.023
The early experimental work was terrific.

21:56.106 --> 21:58.859
You know, he and I showed
at Paula Cooper in the late '60s.

21:58.942 --> 22:02.279
Uh-huh.
I love the '80s stuff, those bears.

22:02.362 --> 22:03.822
You like the bears?

22:03.905 --> 22:06.116
Hmm. I guess the bears.

22:06.867 --> 22:08.910
You know back then, I was the headliner.

22:09.995 --> 22:14.041
I'd like to come, if that's all right.
It would be a real treat for me.

22:14.124 --> 22:15.459
I think they're filled up.

22:15.542 --> 22:18.295
-L.J.'s getting me in special.
-Okay.

22:18.378 --> 22:20.922
I could see about getting you a ticket.
You might have to pay.

22:22.883 --> 22:24.343
Okay, whatever.

22:30.932 --> 22:32.517
Oh, God!

22:32.601 --> 22:36.605
Your orange juice is expired,
which I just realized is possible!

22:38.231 --> 22:39.649
Do you have black tie?

22:40.650 --> 22:42.819
I have a herringbone blazer

22:42.903 --> 22:45.781
and slacks with a hummus stain on the fly.

22:45.864 --> 22:50.368
I think we might have an extra,
belonging to Maureen's late ex-husband.

22:54.998 --> 22:56.666
Dad, no one is in tuxes.

22:56.750 --> 22:58.627
I think I see a couple of people.

22:58.710 --> 23:00.212
I don't see anybody.

23:03.215 --> 23:04.800
We're Harold Meyerowitz.

23:05.509 --> 23:06.635
Okay...

23:06.968 --> 23:10.847
You're on the list for the public viewing,
which starts in 45 minutes.

23:10.931 --> 23:13.183
-Right now this is a private viewing.
-Tell her it's a mistake.

23:13.266 --> 23:15.936
-Tell her L.J. put me on the private list.
-Okay.

23:16.019 --> 23:17.479
-Tell her. This is bullshit.
-Dad.

23:18.313 --> 23:21.274
-We're old friends with L.J.
-Sorry, I can't let you in.

23:21.358 --> 23:23.860
-Right now, it's a private event.
-Tell her to tell L.J....

23:23.944 --> 23:25.695
Dad, she hears everything you're saying.

23:26.321 --> 23:28.782
-Let's just wait for 45 minutes.
-I'm gonna go home.

23:28.865 --> 23:30.826
Come on, Dad. Dad.

23:31.993 --> 23:33.954
My father's Harold Meyerowitz.

23:34.037 --> 23:37.332
He was a contemporary of L.J.'s,
also a sculptor.

23:37.415 --> 23:39.584
-Danny!
-L.J.

23:40.168 --> 23:42.754
This guy giving you trouble? Danny!

23:43.463 --> 23:46.383
You were so damn young
the last time I saw you.

23:46.466 --> 23:49.594
The last time I saw you was at those
Chinatown dinners you guys would throw.

23:49.678 --> 23:52.264
Those were great!
I was living with Dad that year.

23:52.347 --> 23:54.599
-You and Matthew, always playing music.
-Yeah.

23:54.683 --> 23:58.103
Your dad was with Julia,
I was with Maya... before the divorces.

23:58.186 --> 24:00.564
Well, before his second divorce.
He'd already divorced my mom.

24:00.647 --> 24:03.859
-But yeah, those were fun dinners.
-Are you going somewhere after this?

24:03.942 --> 24:05.443
Dad said it was black tie.

24:05.527 --> 24:06.862
-Loretta's here.
-She is?

24:06.945 --> 24:08.989
Yeah, she's floating around
this rat-fuck somewhere.

24:09.072 --> 24:10.740
Oh, I'll look for her.

24:10.824 --> 24:11.992
There's the old man!

24:12.868 --> 24:15.704
-One of my favorite artists.
-I see you stopped dyeing your beard.

24:15.787 --> 24:18.165
Yeah. Look at you.

24:18.248 --> 24:19.875
You guys, you're so cute.

24:20.625 --> 24:23.003
Come, have a drink.
We're having Żubrówka.

24:23.587 --> 24:26.464
I just reread  The Razor's Edge.
It's Larry Darrell's drink.

24:26.548 --> 24:29.301
I find Maugham to be skillful
without being an artist,

24:29.384 --> 24:31.011
but I'll sip a red wine, if you have.

24:31.094 --> 24:33.597
It's the Museum of Modern Art, damn it,
they have everything.

24:34.222 --> 24:36.600
Hey, old man, what happened to your face?

24:36.683 --> 24:38.518
Oh, it's nothing. We got a dog.

24:38.602 --> 24:40.562
You got to be careful at our age.

24:43.064 --> 24:44.065
Okay.

25:14.930 --> 25:15.931
Loretta.

25:17.265 --> 25:18.099
Loretta?

25:19.976 --> 25:20.810
Danny?

25:21.645 --> 25:23.772
Holy shit! Stay there, I'll come to you.

25:26.775 --> 25:28.860
-Oh, you got my hair.
-Oh, I did.

25:28.944 --> 25:31.655
-I didn't know you were coming.
-I came with my dad.

25:31.738 --> 25:34.282
-Are you going somewhere after this?
-No. No.

25:34.866 --> 25:36.826
-Why are you so dressed up?
-I don't know.

25:36.910 --> 25:38.286
I don't fucking know.

25:38.370 --> 25:39.746
-I don't know.
-[laughs]

25:39.829 --> 25:43.291
The work looks good. I don't know
that the presentation is helping.

25:43.375 --> 25:45.794
-Been a pleasure. Thank you.
-You think? Yeah, I think...

25:45.877 --> 25:48.296
some of the bears are not well served,
in a sense.

25:48.380 --> 25:51.800
The work is more intimate than the space.
But, hey, you're on a streak.

25:51.883 --> 25:54.302
Oh, no. Don't say that. Streaks end.

25:54.386 --> 25:55.804
-Hello.
-Oh, Sigourney!

25:55.887 --> 25:57.305
-Congratulations.
-Thank you.

25:57.389 --> 25:59.808
-You're not even dead.
-Wait till the end of this.

25:59.891 --> 26:02.352
Sigourney Weaver,
this is Harold Meyerowitz.

26:02.435 --> 26:04.604
-Hi, I'm Sigourney.
-I'm Harold.

26:04.688 --> 26:05.689
Nice to meet you.

26:06.982 --> 26:10.318
So, I mean, just to see everything
in the same room is awesome.

26:10.402 --> 26:11.611
I'm so glad you came.

26:11.695 --> 26:14.572
-Well, we'll go off and see the bears now.
-Treat them well.

26:14.656 --> 26:17.617
Hey, how are you, old man?
How's Maureen?

26:17.701 --> 26:20.996
-Bard has come to me about a show.
-Are you still teaching there?

26:21.079 --> 26:23.999
No, I'm retired, but my granddaughter
just started as a freshman,

26:24.082 --> 26:25.041
she's making movies.

26:25.125 --> 26:26.751
Oh, they're all doing that now.

26:27.252 --> 26:30.839
I say don't teach them what we do,
there's no damn money in that.

26:30.922 --> 26:32.465
Well, you seem to have found a way.

26:32.549 --> 26:34.634
I hope it's okay. I invited Sigourney
to the dinner afterwards.

26:34.718 --> 26:37.429
Yeah, of course. I've known Sigourney
for 20 years. Glenn, you remem--

26:37.512 --> 26:41.683
I hear a rave tomorrow from Michael,
and Twitter is almost entirely glowing.

26:41.766 --> 26:43.143
-Good.
-We're gonna have a good day.

26:43.226 --> 26:45.437
Glenn Twitchell,
this is Harold Meyerowitz.

26:45.520 --> 26:47.355
-Glenn's the curator here now.
-Nice to meet you.

26:47.439 --> 26:50.150
-We've act... Nice to meet you.
-Wait.

26:50.233 --> 26:52.527
Harold Meyerowitz, shit, of course.
We've met.

26:52.610 --> 26:53.987
-In the '70s.
-It's been a long time.

26:54.070 --> 26:56.865
What have you been doing?
Forgive me, I don't know.

26:56.948 --> 27:00.201
-Are you making art? Are you in the city?
-I'm not talking to you.

27:00.285 --> 27:01.453
Would you excuse me?

27:02.620 --> 27:03.496
Come here.

27:06.416 --> 27:08.335
Hold on a second, old man. Go.

27:11.421 --> 27:13.965
-I remember you like that.
-Yeah.

27:14.799 --> 27:17.427
I used to have mixed feelings
about being part of Dad's art,

27:17.510 --> 27:18.845
but now I kind of love it.

27:18.928 --> 27:20.972
You know,
he dedicated the catalog to me?

27:21.056 --> 27:24.267
It's definitely a cool thing.
This whole thing's really cool.

27:24.351 --> 27:26.811
It's special to me,
I don't get out like this generally.

27:26.895 --> 27:28.730
How's the family and everything?

27:28.813 --> 27:32.025
Well, Karen and I are... splitting up...

27:32.108 --> 27:33.068
Split up.

27:33.151 --> 27:36.237
Oh, shit. I'm sorry.
I'm doing the same thing.

27:36.321 --> 27:38.073
-Really?
-Yeah, but it's good.

27:38.156 --> 27:40.617
My girls are handling it so great.

27:40.700 --> 27:41.785
How are you doing?

27:41.868 --> 27:45.538
Oh, fine. Karen and I stayed together
until Eliza went to school,

27:45.622 --> 27:50.752
but also, I just didn't want to do
what my dad did, you know?

27:51.211 --> 27:53.004
Failed marriages and...

27:53.421 --> 27:55.799
Ever worry we're doing
the same thing as them?

27:55.882 --> 27:58.301
-But we're so different, Danny.
-You think so?

27:58.385 --> 28:01.763
So different. We were raised like animals.

28:01.846 --> 28:03.973
My worry is that we're too different.

28:04.057 --> 28:06.351
We're too close to our kids,
don't you think?

28:06.434 --> 28:10.063
Parents shouldn't be best friends
with their kids.

28:10.146 --> 28:12.857
I mean, I don't think my girls
are ever gonna move out.

28:12.941 --> 28:14.943
I secretly hope that with Eliza,

28:15.026 --> 28:17.654
but, unfortunately,
she seems pretty healthy in that area.

28:19.447 --> 28:21.574
Oh, Danny Meyerowitz.

28:22.200 --> 28:23.576
-I want to go.
-Oh, my God.

28:23.660 --> 28:25.787
-Dad.
-Harold? Loretta.

28:25.870 --> 28:28.957
Loretta, I didn't recognize you at first.

28:29.457 --> 28:30.291
I'm going.

28:30.375 --> 28:33.044
There's that little girl I keep seeing
running down Bond Street.

28:33.128 --> 28:36.089
-I want to go.
-Just a few more minutes, roomie?

28:36.172 --> 28:37.340
I'm leaving.

28:38.591 --> 28:41.344
-Was that a great show of your father's?
-It's a great show.

28:42.512 --> 28:44.431
-We just figured it out.
-You figured it out.

28:44.514 --> 28:47.100
-Also, our apartment was on the...
-Loretta.

28:48.768 --> 28:49.978
-I have to go.
-Oh, no.

28:50.061 --> 28:51.521
Are you not staying for the dinner?

28:51.604 --> 28:53.481
-I don't think we were invited.
-Excuse me, please.

28:55.984 --> 28:57.193
I'd better. He's old.

28:57.277 --> 28:58.737
Oh, okay.

28:58.820 --> 29:01.156
-It was great to see you.
-It was so great.

29:03.366 --> 29:04.826
I got your hair again.

29:06.202 --> 29:08.538
Well... bye, Danny.

29:08.621 --> 29:09.581
Bye.

29:28.057 --> 29:29.100
Dad!

29:31.311 --> 29:32.395
Dad!

29:37.859 --> 29:38.943
Dad!

29:41.029 --> 29:42.030
Dad!

29:43.740 --> 29:44.657
Dad!

29:45.575 --> 29:46.618
Dad.

29:47.452 --> 29:48.620
Did you hear me?

29:49.788 --> 29:50.872
Shit.

29:53.333 --> 29:56.586
Ultimately, L.J. is a popular,
but minor, artist.

29:56.669 --> 30:00.799
There's a superficial bravura,
but there's no unconscious, no discovery.

30:01.508 --> 30:05.345
I know you like the bears, but it's
the reshuffling of obnoxious clichés,

30:05.428 --> 30:08.056
like listening to music
played slightly off-key.

30:08.139 --> 30:11.476
-I didn't get to see it.
-And the video work is embarrassing.

30:11.559 --> 30:14.896
I've never forgiven L.J.
for using Loretta in those pieces.

30:14.979 --> 30:16.815
You don't do that to a child.

30:17.398 --> 30:19.859
And it's a disturbing commentary
on the culture

30:19.943 --> 30:23.780
that truly ordinary work,
made mostly by his assistants,

30:23.863 --> 30:27.575
gets reverent reviews from the critics,
who ought to know better.

30:28.493 --> 30:30.662
He's a talented, pretentious enigma.

30:30.745 --> 30:32.330
Let me see if there's a cab.

30:35.333 --> 30:36.751
It's nice to see Loretta.

30:37.669 --> 30:40.421
She was very happy to see me.
She gave me quite a kiss.

30:40.505 --> 30:41.756
I did well.

30:41.840 --> 30:45.093
I was pretty funny, I think.
I didn't get her number or anything.

30:45.176 --> 30:47.846
Maybe you can give me L.J.'s email.

30:48.429 --> 30:51.850
I don't feel comfortable giving it out,
maybe there's a work one.

30:51.933 --> 30:53.184
Okay.

30:53.268 --> 30:55.311
I met Sigourney Weaver...

30:56.062 --> 30:57.605
who was very friendly.

30:58.189 --> 31:00.149
She said, "Hi, I'm Sigourney."

31:00.233 --> 31:01.818
I said, "Hi, I'm Harold."

31:06.197 --> 31:08.116
Have you thought about getting a job?

31:09.033 --> 31:11.369
You've essentially never worked
in your life.

31:13.037 --> 31:14.956
I think you'd feel better about yourself.

31:17.292 --> 31:19.043
Have you thought
about playing music again?

31:23.590 --> 31:25.633
Maureen will be back next Thursday.

31:26.301 --> 31:28.469
You should think
about where you're going to live.

31:30.263 --> 31:32.765
I mean, you could stay with us
for a while but...

32:15.934 --> 32:17.560
Maureen wanted me to remind you

32:17.644 --> 32:19.437
to go through the boxes
and things upstairs,

32:19.520 --> 32:21.481
because we're going to start
throwing things away.

32:22.065 --> 32:23.316
You might want these sunglasses.

32:25.693 --> 32:27.946
-Those are Matthew's.
-I'm letting him know, too.

32:28.947 --> 32:32.492
-[Eliza]  Hello? Sorry, hello?
-Yo, how you doing?

32:32.575 --> 32:34.661
Sorry, Elvis is making me laugh.

32:34.744 --> 32:36.162
Who's Elvis?

32:36.245 --> 32:38.081
What? Sorry, Joaquin's roommate.

32:38.164 --> 32:39.999
Oh, okay. Who's Joaquin?

32:40.083 --> 32:41.793
He's a friend. What's up, Dad?

32:42.293 --> 32:44.045
Well, I'm at Harold's.

32:44.128 --> 32:47.715
We went
to L.J. Shapiro's opening at MoMA.

32:47.799 --> 32:48.925
Was it fun?

32:49.008 --> 32:50.927
Yeah, for a little while.

32:51.010 --> 32:52.387
You having fun with Grandpa?

32:53.179 --> 32:57.183
I might go stay at Jean's in Rochester
for a while.

32:57.266 --> 32:59.268
I'll be closer to you, but don't worry.

32:59.352 --> 33:00.311
Okay.

33:00.395 --> 33:03.398
We're gonna see this band, and then
there's a party. Call you tomorrow?

33:03.982 --> 33:05.984
Yeah, I'll be up early.

33:06.067 --> 33:07.902
-What's wrong?
-Nothing.

33:07.986 --> 33:09.821
-I can hear it in your voice.
-Nothing.

33:09.904 --> 33:11.197
Tell me.

33:11.280 --> 33:13.241
Hold on, I'm gonna step outside
so we can talk.

33:13.324 --> 33:16.077
No. Go to your concert,
I promise I'm fine.

33:16.160 --> 33:17.578
-You promise?
-Yes.

33:18.162 --> 33:21.332
Okay. I'm gonna keep my phone on
in case you want to call, okay?

33:21.416 --> 33:23.126
There's no need, don't worry.

33:23.209 --> 33:25.420
Otherwise, let's talk in the morning?

33:25.503 --> 33:27.588
-Okay, have fun.
-But call if you need to.

33:27.672 --> 33:29.507
-I won't.
-Bye, Dad.

33:30.049 --> 33:31.134
Bye.

34:21.350 --> 34:23.561
-It's okay. Right?
-Is that okay that that just happened?

34:23.643 --> 34:25.188
-I don't know.
-I'm scared, Matt.

34:25.271 --> 34:28.065
-These guys are six months behind.
-That's why I'm here.

34:28.649 --> 34:32.445
I put together a document that anticipates
where you'll be at the end of the year,

34:32.527 --> 34:34.197
vis-à-vis the overages.

34:34.280 --> 34:37.699
Oh, for Christ. Really?
Have we already spent this much?

34:37.784 --> 34:39.077

34:42.080 --> 34:44.206
The change orders are adding up.

34:44.290 --> 34:46.292
We didn't budget for the salt water pool.

34:46.876 --> 34:48.002
How's your kid?

34:48.377 --> 34:49.462
Good!

34:49.545 --> 34:51.589
I'm in a fight with my wife right now.

34:51.672 --> 34:54.342
But, Randy, I don't want
to sound alarmist,

34:54.425 --> 34:56.552
but you're not gonna be able
to sustain your lifestyle

34:56.636 --> 34:57.970
if things continue like this.

34:58.054 --> 35:00.139
And you're not going on tour anytime soon.

35:03.434 --> 35:04.560
-That's nice.
-Right?

35:04.644 --> 35:08.731
It's my own espresso bean. See?
I'm doing everything I can to make a buck.

35:08.815 --> 35:10.733
The coffee will pay for the pool.

35:10.817 --> 35:12.777
That might be too much pressure
to put on coffee.

35:13.361 --> 35:15.071
Here's what we're gonna do,
get you the pool...

35:15.154 --> 35:17.115
-Yes!
-But not this year.

35:17.198 --> 35:19.867
We're gonna rent out the bottom floor,
which is zoned commercial anyway,

35:19.951 --> 35:22.328
-and get a tenant for the second floor.
-But can't I afford...

35:22.411 --> 35:24.622
Income from rentals
will cover property taxes,

35:24.705 --> 35:26.666
you live on the top two floors.

-Everything else you can have.
-[cell phone ringing]

35:28.793 --> 35:29.669
Let me just...

35:29.752 --> 35:31.921
-Hello?
-[Harold]  They won't seat me without you.

35:32.004 --> 35:34.382
-Where are you?
-I'm standing outside the place.

35:34.465 --> 35:37.301
-You're 45 minutes early.
-There are many available tables.

35:37.385 --> 35:39.303
-The guy was a jerk.
-We have a reservation.

35:39.387 --> 35:41.222
-Did you say my name?
-I said my name.

35:41.305 --> 35:44.308
-Let me finish up, we'll figure it out.
-How long are you gonna be?

35:44.392 --> 35:46.018
I'll be there at 1
when we said we'd meet.

35:46.102 --> 35:48.563
Hurry up.
Parking was easier than I anticipated.

35:48.646 --> 35:50.148
Okay, I'll see you soon.

35:51.440 --> 35:52.733
We won't do the pool now.

35:52.817 --> 35:55.111
-I think that's the right decision.
-Everything okay?

35:55.194 --> 35:56.946
Totally. Lunch with my father.

35:57.572 --> 35:58.531
Say no more.

35:58.614 --> 36:00.199
No, now it's easy.

36:00.283 --> 36:03.369
When I was younger,
I was so invested in his grievances,

36:03.452 --> 36:07.165
his anger at the world,
they were mine, too,

36:07.248 --> 36:11.002
but now that I live 3,000 miles away
and have my own kid, a thriving business,

36:11.085 --> 36:12.753
I don't even get angry at him anymore.

36:12.837 --> 36:15.006
It's even just funny, you know...

36:15.089 --> 36:17.884
[coughing]

36:20.386 --> 36:21.721
Sorry, I don't know why I'm suddenly...

36:21.804 --> 36:23.931
I think it's all this plaster dust
and coffee.

36:24.015 --> 36:25.850
-Do you need something?
-Like what?

36:25.933 --> 36:28.895
Let's see. One brings you up
and the other brings you down,

36:28.978 --> 36:30.938
but I'm not totally certain
which is which.

36:31.022 --> 36:32.023
Do you have a guess?

36:32.106 --> 36:34.400
-I haven't worn these pants in a while.
-I don't...

36:34.483 --> 36:35.735
Take both.

36:35.818 --> 36:36.944
Thanks, Matt.

36:38.529 --> 36:40.239
I don't have anyone in my life like you.

36:40.907 --> 36:42.617
-There's my son.
-Hey.

36:44.577 --> 36:46.495
These are yours.
They were in the upstairs room.

36:46.579 --> 36:49.081
Maureen is throwing things out.
I wanted you to have them.

36:49.165 --> 36:50.082
Thanks.

36:51.542 --> 36:54.128
-The Vuarnets are Danny's.
-He said they were yours.

36:54.212 --> 36:56.214
-No, you can throw them out.
-They're quite fancy.

36:56.297 --> 36:57.340
Maybe Maureen will use them.

36:57.423 --> 37:00.009
-What happened to your face?
-We got a dog. Did I tell you?

37:00.092 --> 37:03.095
-Maybe.
-Bruno, my charge, we call him Bruno.

37:03.179 --> 37:06.265
Named for the idiot
in Werner Herzog's  Stroszek.

37:06.349 --> 37:07.975
-Never seen it.
-Really?

37:08.059 --> 37:10.311
I own the cassette at home,
if you want to come over.

37:10.394 --> 37:11.354
So what happened?

37:11.437 --> 37:15.650
Oh, he lunged for a deranged hare,
taking me in the process.

37:15.733 --> 37:17.777
-You should see the other dog.
-You all right?

37:17.860 --> 37:20.363
I'm fine. He didn't mean it.
It wasn't his fault.

37:20.446 --> 37:22.573
-Shall we go in?
-I'm not eating here.

37:23.074 --> 37:26.077
-Because they wouldn't seat you?
-The guy was very obnoxious.

37:26.160 --> 37:29.330
-Let me talk to him.
-No, let's go somewhere else.

37:29.413 --> 37:32.833
-I only have an hour and a half.
-It's my protest, like McEnroe.

37:33.876 --> 37:35.336
Okay, let me think.

37:40.841 --> 37:43.844
Not too far because at 3,
I have to put money in the meter.

37:43.928 --> 37:46.389
-This man is treading right on my heels.
-No, Dad, he's with me.

37:46.472 --> 37:48.724
This is Gabe.
He works at my firm in New York.

37:48.808 --> 37:49.976
Nice to meet you, Mr. Meyerowitz.

37:50.059 --> 37:51.852
I thought Gabe could join us
for part of lunch.

37:51.936 --> 37:54.522
-His specialty is in estate planning.
-I have an accountant.

37:54.605 --> 37:56.107
I had a chance to review
some documents...

37:56.190 --> 37:57.942
Barry Sukenick doesn't work
on this scale, Dad,

37:58.025 --> 38:00.486
and I think, as we move
toward selling the house,

38:00.569 --> 38:02.446
it might be a good time
to get some affairs in order.

38:02.530 --> 38:04.031
If we sell the house,
it will be my decision.

38:04.115 --> 38:05.866
-Pardon me.
-Brian and James, who you've met...

38:05.950 --> 38:09.662
Very charming interracial homosexual
couple, and smart about the work.

38:09.745 --> 38:11.247
They were familiar with "Gilded Halfwing."

38:11.330 --> 38:14.542
Yes, James says they like the work
very much, and they love the house,

38:14.625 --> 38:15.876
and they made us an offer.

38:15.960 --> 38:16.961
For the work, too?

38:17.044 --> 38:19.505
For the work, the house,
some of the furniture.

38:21.757 --> 38:23.551
-Your brother doesn't want to sell.
-Brother?

38:23.634 --> 38:26.429
Half-brother, we have a different mother.
That's a real shame for him, then.

38:26.512 --> 38:29.265
Danny stands the most to benefit.
He doesn't work.

38:29.348 --> 38:32.226
-He and Karen have separated.
-Really?

38:32.310 --> 38:35.062
I took him in,
but now he's with Jean in Rochester.

38:35.146 --> 38:37.356
-Shit.
-Apparently, his mother moved to Florida,

38:37.440 --> 38:38.983
which I didn't know. Did you know that?

38:39.066 --> 38:41.986
-No.
-She's still angry with me, apparently.

38:42.069 --> 38:46.282
You know your brother and sister helped
organize a show for me up at Bard.

38:46.991 --> 38:49.827
-A retrospective?
-A retrospective of the faculty, yes.

38:49.910 --> 38:51.495
Like a... group show.

38:51.579 --> 38:53.873
-I'll just sit here.
-Well, there's other artists, yes,

38:53.956 --> 38:57.752
but... I was promised
a very prominent place in the gallery.

38:58.419 --> 38:59.754
Sounds good, congratulations.

38:59.837 --> 39:03.632
You purchased the property in 1973
for $60,000,

39:03.716 --> 39:05.843
but since you've borrowed
against the house a couple times,

39:05.926 --> 39:07.345
the net proceeds have diminished.

39:07.428 --> 39:08.721
Danny thinks that after the show,

39:08.804 --> 39:11.515
my work could appreciate considerably
in value and that we should wait.

39:11.599 --> 39:13.726
You just told me
Danny doesn't want to sell at all.

39:14.518 --> 39:17.146
Dad, whatever happens at Bard,
you can't afford the real estate taxes.

39:17.229 --> 39:19.982
You're paying two grand a month
in utilities.

39:20.066 --> 39:21.359
Things you wouldn't think: housekeepers...

39:21.442 --> 39:22.985
Mercedes has been with us for years,

39:23.069 --> 39:25.946
and though I deplore her politics,
I'm not letting her go.

39:26.030 --> 39:27.990
-I'm giving examples.
-Am I paying for him?

39:28.074 --> 39:31.619
No, he's doing this as a favor.
Dad, Gabe's specialty is not my specialty.

39:31.702 --> 39:33.704
-I'm in personal wealth.
-Something I wouldn't know about.

39:34.789 --> 39:37.625
-Gabe would only get paid when we sell.
-I'm not giving Gabe anything.

39:37.708 --> 39:40.669
Absolutely not. And I'm not having
this conversation with him.

39:40.753 --> 39:43.130
-This is a private family matter.
-Okay, I understand.

39:43.214 --> 39:45.674
Normally, conspiracy is mounted
by people close to you.

39:45.758 --> 39:47.385
I don't even know this asshole.

39:50.221 --> 39:52.098
-Can we get a check?
-We didn't order anything.

39:52.181 --> 39:54.975
-I wanted to punch Gabe right in the nose.
-The owner is a client.

39:55.059 --> 39:57.353
That's why we could get the table
so last minute.

39:57.937 --> 39:59.772
That's why they gave us this bigger table.

40:00.523 --> 40:02.942
I imagine they'll send
some complementary stuff, too.

40:04.318 --> 40:05.611
Is that baby aspirin?

40:05.694 --> 40:08.197
-Adult aspirin bothers my stomach.
-Are you okay?

40:08.280 --> 40:10.783
-I've had some headaches, it's fine.
-Have you gone to a doctor?

40:10.866 --> 40:11.784
That's not necessary.

40:12.743 --> 40:14.870
You're so important, you need two phones.

40:14.954 --> 40:17.248
So, L.J. has a show at MoMA,
thought I'd check it out.

40:17.331 --> 40:19.583
I was at the opening.
I met Sigourney Weaver.

40:19.667 --> 40:21.127
-How is L.J.?
-We chatted.

40:21.210 --> 40:25.005
She said to me, "My name is Sigourney."
I said, "My name is Harold."

40:25.089 --> 40:26.006
Uh-huh.

40:26.090 --> 40:29.009
L.J. says he's gonna try to come
to the show at Bard.

40:29.093 --> 40:31.429
-That's great.
-I'm sure he'd like to see you there.

40:31.512 --> 40:32.471
Yeah, if I'm in town.

40:32.555 --> 40:34.598
I think I'm gonna show one of the bronzes.

40:34.682 --> 40:38.060
It's an early piece I made when you used
to sit on the floor and watch me work.

40:38.144 --> 40:39.186
You remember that?

40:39.812 --> 40:42.106
You've told me this before,
and I don't remember it.

40:42.189 --> 40:45.484
You would hand me tools and make
suggestions as if you too were the artist.

40:45.568 --> 40:46.861
Well, I wasn't.

40:46.944 --> 40:49.196
It was originally untitled,
but I'm gonna call it "Matthew."

40:50.072 --> 40:51.490
I'd like to see Eliza, too.

40:51.574 --> 40:54.785
She sent me her movie, which I thought
was really good. Did you like it?

40:54.869 --> 40:57.580
At that time, I thought you might be
interested in sculpture,

40:57.663 --> 40:59.457
or maybe an actor or a comic.

40:59.540 --> 41:01.041
You were a very talented mimic.

41:02.710 --> 41:06.630
I do the voices of a lot of my coworkers,
which cracks people up at the firm.

41:07.631 --> 41:09.633
"I'm gonna run downstairs for an e-smoke."

41:12.011 --> 41:14.013
You don't know...
[chuckles]

41:14.972 --> 41:17.057
You don't know Ezra,
but that's a pretty good imitation.

41:17.141 --> 41:19.143
You were also very musical, like Danny.

41:20.227 --> 41:22.396
-But Danny could really play.
-No, that's true.

41:22.480 --> 41:25.649
He was quite gifted.
I don't know why he didn't pursue it.

41:25.733 --> 41:28.986
I know he raised a child, but in this day
and age, it's possible to do both.

41:29.069 --> 41:31.697
There are so many other things
that factor in, don't you think?

41:31.780 --> 41:33.073
I thought you'd do something artistic.

41:34.617 --> 41:37.578
I work with artists.
I understand the temperament.

41:37.661 --> 41:39.914
Maybe Eliza will be my heir
in that department.

41:39.997 --> 41:42.166
Although, she seems
more commercially minded,

41:42.249 --> 41:43.751
and potentially a lesbian.

41:43.834 --> 41:45.377
Really? I didn't get that.

41:45.461 --> 41:48.964
You know, I think I mentioned to you
I left the company I was with.

41:49.048 --> 41:51.884
Me and a couple of other people
started our own firm.

41:51.967 --> 41:55.679
It was scary and a big change, but things
have settled and we're doing really well.

41:55.763 --> 41:58.516
-Maureen is talking to a friend...
-A lot of old clients came with us.

41:58.599 --> 42:00.726
about getting someone to come up
and review the show.

42:00.809 --> 42:03.521
-I think we're....
-I've been ignored by the  Times.

42:03.604 --> 42:05.397
We're a great alternative
to some of the bigger firms.

42:05.481 --> 42:08.192
-...this might put me back on the map.
-This is our logo.

42:09.485 --> 42:11.278
Fifty-five dollars for a steak.

42:11.862 --> 42:14.532
-They're known for their meat here.
-And $35 for a salmon?

42:15.491 --> 42:18.202
Do you get the salmon to blow you
for that price?

42:18.285 --> 42:21.330
-Do you want to split a salmon?
-I'm gonna get my own steak.

42:21.413 --> 42:24.083
-A whole portion is too much for me.
-Eat what you can.

42:24.166 --> 42:25.376
-I'll have a starter.
-I'm paying.

42:25.459 --> 42:27.962
Have you dined with us before?
Do you have any questions?

42:28.045 --> 42:30.506
We have answers. I'll have a salad.

42:30.589 --> 42:33.092
-The Little Gem, okay.
-...to start, and then I'll have a steak.

42:33.175 --> 42:36.262
-The six ounce or the twelve?
-Twelve and maybe a spinach for the table.

42:36.345 --> 42:38.347
-The potatoes sound good.
-Sure.

42:38.430 --> 42:40.683
And... shall we get a wine?

42:40.766 --> 42:41.725
Live it up.

42:41.809 --> 42:43.811
And maybe... this Brunello.

42:43.894 --> 42:45.312
That's one of my favorites.

42:45.896 --> 42:48.023
I'll have the steak and the market salad.

42:48.107 --> 42:50.317
We don't have a ton of time,
bring everything at once?

42:50.401 --> 42:51.318
Of course.

42:52.319 --> 42:54.572
How's my grandson who I never get to see?

42:57.324 --> 42:58.242
Here.

42:59.118 --> 43:01.328
He's quite handsome. His hair's so blonde.

43:01.412 --> 43:03.455
No, that's his friend Sebastian.

43:03.539 --> 43:05.416
He's the one with his hand
in his trousers.

43:05.499 --> 43:06.750
He's tucking in his shirt.

43:06.834 --> 43:08.877
He looks like the child
in Kubrick's  The Shining.

43:08.961 --> 43:10.004
It's the sweater, I think.

43:10.087 --> 43:13.090
Handsome boy, has the Meyerowitz eyes.
Does he like the Knicks?

43:13.173 --> 43:14.466
I suppose he'll be a Lakers fan

43:14.550 --> 43:16.844
since you're essentially an Angeleno
at this point.

43:16.927 --> 43:18.971
It's hard to have a relationship
and a child.

43:19.722 --> 43:21.348
-I imagine you felt that, too.
-No.

43:21.432 --> 43:23.434
Not really. I didn't find that difficult.

43:24.727 --> 43:27.813
-Dad, you've been married four times.
-Three, the first one was annulled.

43:27.896 --> 43:31.150
I married her because of Tony, but I think
about what it would mean to leave,

43:31.233 --> 43:33.402
but even contemplating it
makes me feel guilty.

43:33.485 --> 43:36.363
I haven't met his mother,
so I can't advise you in that department.

43:36.447 --> 43:38.198
You could've if you'd come to our wedding.

43:38.282 --> 43:39.658
You did it in L.A.

43:39.742 --> 43:42.119
Well, anyway, I didn't invite
a lot of people, but everyone I invited,

43:42.202 --> 43:44.204
including Mom, came except for you.

43:44.288 --> 43:46.248
-It's so brazen.
-What?

43:46.332 --> 43:48.334
This jerk just put his glasses
on our table.

43:49.585 --> 43:52.171
-I don't think he realizes...
-Oh, no. He knows exactly what he's doing.

43:52.254 --> 43:53.964
Dad, in terms of your estate,

43:54.048 --> 43:55.966
I don't want you making mistakes
that could be avoided.

43:56.050 --> 43:57.635
Then they will be my mistakes.

43:58.510 --> 43:59.803
We'll have this decanted.

43:59.887 --> 44:03.057
Very nice. Before she dried out,
Maureen drank half my wine cellar,

44:03.140 --> 44:05.309
so I haven't had any good wine in a while.

44:05.392 --> 44:07.186
But she's been sober for six weeks.

44:07.269 --> 44:09.855
-Is she still going to A.A.?
-She's doing it her own way.

44:09.938 --> 44:12.274
Maureen is made uncomfortable
by A.A., which I can understand.

44:12.358 --> 44:15.444
It's quite infantilizing,
giving away your control like that.

44:15.527 --> 44:16.695
I think that's the idea.

44:16.779 --> 44:20.240
I tell Maureen, "I don't like you when
you drink. You become a different person."

44:21.450 --> 44:23.827
-Does it look like we need two ketchups?
-What are you talking about?

44:23.911 --> 44:26.080
The son-of-a-bitch just put his ketchup
on our table, too.

44:26.664 --> 44:28.540
Before you know it,
he'll be sitting in my lap.

44:29.458 --> 44:32.795
-I'm gonna punch this guy in the nose.
-It's fine. We have the bigger table.

44:35.798 --> 44:37.675
Dad, what the fuck?

44:39.635 --> 44:41.804
-Please don't do that again.
-It's my protest.

44:41.887 --> 44:44.056
You better hope he doesn't have a cold.

44:45.766 --> 44:48.602
They're leaving. Can you relax now?
I'd like to relax now.

44:49.144 --> 44:50.229
So brazen.

44:50.312 --> 44:52.189
I think the Knicks
might be interesting this year.

44:52.272 --> 44:53.190
Wait a minute.

44:55.609 --> 44:57.277
Wait a minute, where's my jacket?

44:57.361 --> 44:58.737
-Next to you.
-This isn't my jacket.

44:58.821 --> 45:00.906
-That son of a bitch took my jacket.
-What do you mean?

45:00.989 --> 45:03.784
-He has my jacket, Matthew.
-He's still outside. I'll get it back.

45:03.867 --> 45:06.078
Shit! It's three o'clock.
I have to put money in the meter.

45:06.161 --> 45:08.455
-Forget it.
-I'm not getting a ticket, Matthew.

45:08.539 --> 45:10.874
Fuck it. I'm gonna grab the guy,
you get the check.

45:10.958 --> 45:13.168
I thought you were paying.
I wouldn't have ordered wine.

45:13.252 --> 45:17.339
-Well, what do you want me to do?
-Where's our waiter? Excuse me!

45:44.658 --> 45:45.659
Dad!

45:48.662 --> 45:49.746
Sir!

46:01.175 --> 46:04.761
Excuse me!

46:05.262 --> 46:07.097
-What?
-Sorry, I think there was a mix-up.

46:07.181 --> 46:09.725
-You seem to have taken my dad's jacket.
-What?

46:09.808 --> 46:11.727
You have his jacket. We have yours.

46:11.810 --> 46:13.729
-It's on its way.
-This is my jacket, man.

46:13.812 --> 46:15.898
I think it isn't.
Just wait till he gets here.

46:15.981 --> 46:19.610
-I know what jacket I took.
-I understand, but you took the wrong one.

46:20.110 --> 46:23.197
-You crazy, man.
-Listen, just wait a second, okay?

46:23.280 --> 46:26.116
Jesus, what does it cost you?
Where you got to be?

46:26.200 --> 46:28.660
-Where's he going?
-Just hang on. Hey, turn around.

46:28.744 --> 46:31.038
-You want to get hit, man?
-What is your problem?

46:31.121 --> 46:32.039
[speaking French]

46:32.122 --> 46:35.042
Can't you see?
You have my father's jacket, he has yours.

46:35.125 --> 46:38.212
What's the fucking problem?
Dad, give him his jacket.

46:38.921 --> 46:40.297
-What is that?
-It's a ticket stub

46:40.380 --> 46:42.466
for something called  Fault in Our Stars.

46:42.549 --> 46:43.967
-I don't know that.
-Of course you do.

46:44.051 --> 46:46.345
It has the kids dying of cancer.
It was a big hit.

46:46.428 --> 46:47.554
I've seen it.

46:48.263 --> 46:51.391
-When did you see  Fault in Our Stars?
-  In the country at the triplex.

46:51.475 --> 46:52.851
It was quite affecting, actually.

46:52.935 --> 46:54.603
Those kids were tremendously winning.

46:54.686 --> 46:58.815
Dad, how would he have your ticket stub
to  Fault in Our Stars  in his jacket?

46:59.525 --> 47:02.486
-No ticket, stroke of luck.
-That guy was a real asshole.

47:02.569 --> 47:05.447
-He was. We never really had our lunch.
-Fucking tourist.

47:05.948 --> 47:09.159
I should've said something more cutting.
I let him get away with being a prick.

47:09.243 --> 47:11.954
-It's gonna eat at me.
-Sure you don't wanna come to the house?

47:12.037 --> 47:14.081
-Maureen was gonna make pigeon.
-No, I have to go, Dad.

47:14.164 --> 47:15.374
Where are you going?

47:15.457 --> 47:16.833
I'm going over to Mom's, actually.

47:16.917 --> 47:19.002
-Maybe I'll go with you.
-I don't know if that's...

47:19.086 --> 47:21.296
That was the summer on Martha's Vineyard

47:21.380 --> 47:24.424
-with L.J., Maya, Paul, and Lori.
-We were staying at the Knapp house,

47:24.508 --> 47:26.969
-the one with that peculiar blind dog.
-Yeah.

47:27.052 --> 47:30.514
And Matthew, you were making up
all of these card games, you remember?

47:30.597 --> 47:34.768
And there was one in particular
where I asked if it was based on luck,

47:34.851 --> 47:36.853
and you said it was based on "hope."

47:36.937 --> 47:38.522
You "hoped" you got a good card.

47:38.605 --> 47:41.400
And that's what we said all summer,
remember? "It's based on hope."

47:41.483 --> 47:43.944
I was commissioned to make
"Gilded Halfwing" that summer.

47:44.027 --> 47:47.364
L.J. was very jealous.
I had already sold a piece to the Whitney.

47:47.447 --> 47:50.742
-Where do they keep that piece?
-It's not lost. They catalog these things.

47:50.826 --> 47:53.370
-I didn't say it was.
-Harold, did you see?

47:53.954 --> 47:55.372
Oh.

47:55.455 --> 47:58.375
You still have one of the sketches
of "Gilded Halfwing."

47:58.458 --> 48:00.919
-It looks good here.
-Yeah, Cody really admires it.

48:01.003 --> 48:03.922
-He says it gives him ideas.
-I thought Cody was a gym teacher.

48:04.006 --> 48:07.843
No, he taught Spanish at P.S. 182
and coached the soccer team.

48:07.926 --> 48:11.138
Matthew, Cody's sons are coming
for dinner. I'm making a meatloaf.

48:11.221 --> 48:12.389
Okay, good, I'm starving.

48:12.472 --> 48:14.975
I told Matthew this seems
like an elaborate ruse

48:15.058 --> 48:16.935
just to get his parents back together.

48:17.019 --> 48:18.478
-You didn't tell me that.
-[cell phone ringing]

48:18.562 --> 48:20.981
Oh, this is Tony on FaceTime.
You mind if I...

48:21.064 --> 48:22.983
Harold, do you want coffee
or a tea or anything?

48:23.066 --> 48:24.359
-[Matthew] He has to go!
-Tea would be nice.

48:24.443 --> 48:25.861
I can't have coffee after four.

48:25.944 --> 48:26.820
[Matthew] Hi, sweetheart!

48:26.903 --> 48:28.989
And if you have a Triscuit or something,
I'm also starving.

48:29.072 --> 48:30.699
[Tony]  Hi, I'm playing
a game for a minute.

48:30.782 --> 48:34.328
It's called All the Animals Are Dead.
Do you want to see it?

48:35.037 --> 48:38.498
Dad, would you rather have
a beard made of paper

48:38.582 --> 48:40.000
or a beard made from a tree?

48:40.083 --> 48:41.793
What's a beard made from a tree?

48:41.877 --> 48:45.213
A beard made from a tree
is a beard which is like a tree.

48:45.881 --> 48:48.842
-Like... leaves on a tree?
-Yeah, but like a beard.

48:48.925 --> 48:51.178
-I'm in the middle of cooking.
-I guess a beard made from a tree?

48:51.261 --> 48:53.305
-Me, too.
-Is this my  Buddenbrooks ?

48:53.388 --> 48:56.016
-I think this is my copy of  Buddenbrooks .
-I don't know.

48:56.099 --> 48:58.852
Would you rather die from old age
or kill yourself?

49:01.980 --> 49:03.899
-Old age, I guess.
-Me, too.

49:04.399 --> 49:06.193
[woman]  Did you give him regular milk?

49:06.943 --> 49:08.862
-Victoria, I didn't know you were there.
-Of course I'm here.

49:08.945 --> 49:10.864
He doesn't know
how to use the phone by himself.

49:10.947 --> 49:12.199
[Tony]  Yes, I do.

49:12.282 --> 49:14.993
-[Victoria]  He can't have dairy.
-We don't know that for a fact.

49:15.077 --> 49:16.745
-Yes, we do.
-[Tony]  I'm gonna press the button now.

49:16.828 --> 49:19.081
-Wait. I love you. Baby?
-I'm pressing the...

49:19.164 --> 49:20.999
Tell him Grandma says hi.

49:21.083 --> 49:22.209
[Harold] Me, too.

49:23.919 --> 49:28.298
We were very thorough when we divided
the books, that I remember.

49:28.382 --> 49:30.467
Me, too. Put it back, Dad.

49:30.550 --> 49:32.010
I've been looking for this edition.

49:32.094 --> 49:35.305
You've lived without it now for 30 years.
I think you can manage.

49:35.389 --> 49:39.226
You can take it, Harold, if you want.
I've mostly stopped reading fiction.

49:39.309 --> 49:41.645
-I'll walk you to the car?
-I can stay a bit longer.

49:41.728 --> 49:44.523
It's so nice to see you again, Harold.

49:44.606 --> 49:47.109
I think the last time
was Matt's graduation.

49:49.194 --> 49:50.195
You know...

49:50.904 --> 49:53.699
there's something
that I wanted to say and...

49:56.118 --> 49:58.537
I thought of calling or writing,
but I never did.

49:59.121 --> 50:02.999
I have huge regrets
about how I was with Danny and Jean.

50:03.834 --> 50:06.670
I was a kid myself in many ways and...

50:07.421 --> 50:12.050
you were so angry with me,
I took your lead, frankly,

50:12.134 --> 50:14.761
and we were starting over, we had Matt.

50:15.554 --> 50:19.099
We didn't want to look back,
and that was understandable, but...

50:21.017 --> 50:23.687
I wish I'd been more nurturing of them.

50:24.896 --> 50:26.189
More generous.

50:27.607 --> 50:29.776
More mothering, really.

50:31.278 --> 50:35.866
I think they suffered in part
because of that and... I feel terrible.

50:37.784 --> 50:39.619
Anyway, that's what I wanted to say.

50:44.124 --> 50:45.292
Nice to see you.

50:45.917 --> 50:47.544
It's called flirting when you're young.

50:47.627 --> 50:49.546
I'm not sure what it's called
when you're over 70.

50:49.629 --> 50:50.547
You're just up here.

50:50.630 --> 50:54.009
She still has my drawing on her wall
next to the gym teacher's doodle.

50:54.092 --> 50:55.093
Cody's a good guy.

50:55.177 --> 50:58.764
Your mother is more comfortable ultimately
being with men who are half-smart.

50:58.847 --> 51:01.475
Then she can dominate.
I was much too formidable.

51:02.058 --> 51:06.271
After our separation and before Cody,
she was with a homosexual,

51:06.354 --> 51:09.065
and before that, a man who had no foot.

51:09.149 --> 51:13.528
Her fraudulent claims about
not reading fiction I find offensive.

51:13.612 --> 51:18.325
She's masquerading as a populist
so as to not threaten Cody.

51:18.408 --> 51:21.077
But it's a clever, yet bogus, subterfuge.

51:21.745 --> 51:24.206
It's a shame your mother,
who knows better,

51:24.289 --> 51:27.459
has succumbed
to this fashionable anti-art movement.

51:27.542 --> 51:29.628
This is why we have
a Republican Congress.

51:29.711 --> 51:30.921
I can't believe you took the book.

51:31.004 --> 51:32.756
She said I could have it.
It was mine originally.

51:32.839 --> 51:33.840
You have your keys?

51:34.633 --> 51:36.760
She was clearly very happy to see me.

51:37.302 --> 51:39.930
When it ended,
we weren't on speaking terms,

51:40.013 --> 51:42.599
but now you see that big hug
she insisted on giving me?

51:42.682 --> 51:45.560
You know, Maureen always said
that your mother was the love of my life.

51:45.644 --> 51:48.188
-You gonna take the bridge or the tunnel?
-I thought you were leaving tomorrow.

51:48.271 --> 51:49.898
That's why I drove
all the way into Brooklyn.

51:49.981 --> 51:51.149
I'm staying a few days.

51:51.233 --> 51:53.235
[coughing]

51:54.194 --> 51:56.029
I was around
all this plaster dust earlier.

51:56.112 --> 51:58.990
We have lots of room.
Maureen is keen on seeing you as well.

51:59.074 --> 52:02.118
You know, she's your stepmother
as much as Cody is your stepfather.

52:02.202 --> 52:03.745
I told Mom I'd stay here.

52:03.829 --> 52:06.122
Maybe split half the time there
and half with us?

52:06.206 --> 52:08.375
I'm not splitting the time
like I did at 15.

52:08.458 --> 52:10.544
It was very important to me
after our separation

52:10.627 --> 52:12.045
that I see you half the time.

52:12.128 --> 52:14.422
I wanted to make it up
after Danny and Jean.

52:14.506 --> 52:16.883
-Then make it up to them.
-I made a real effort with you.

52:16.967 --> 52:18.552
Danny and Jean, I could've done better,

52:18.635 --> 52:21.513
but I don't see anything significant
I could've done better with you.

52:21.596 --> 52:23.807
-Really? Nothing?
-Oh, come on, Matthew.

52:23.890 --> 52:25.350
You feel like that all was great?

52:25.433 --> 52:28.603
Danny definitely got shit,
and Jean didn't even get shit.

52:28.687 --> 52:32.148
But I got your focus, and that
fucked me up in a whole other way.

52:32.232 --> 52:34.109
Matthew, we never see each other.
Let's not fight.

52:34.192 --> 52:35.902
I keep thinking I know
how to handle you now,

52:35.986 --> 52:39.072
but then I see you and I get suckered
into your shit all over again:

52:39.155 --> 52:40.699
your career, your jacket.

52:40.782 --> 52:43.577
And then, when I try to actually help,
like today, you won't listen!

52:43.660 --> 52:45.662
I don't see how I could be
such a bad father.

52:45.745 --> 52:47.914
-Look how successful you are.
-Right.

52:47.998 --> 52:50.125
-I could never be the businessman you are.
-Okay.

52:50.208 --> 52:52.502
I've said to Maureen,
"I don't know who Matthew takes after.

52:52.586 --> 52:54.170
I certainly didn't know
how to make money."

52:54.254 --> 52:56.381
That's right, I don't take after you!
None of us do!

52:56.464 --> 52:58.550
You had to be
the only artist in the family!

52:58.633 --> 53:01.553
It doesn't matter that I make money,
because you don't respect what I do!

53:01.636 --> 53:02.929
What do you need my respect for?

53:03.013 --> 53:04.806
The world respects you
because you make money.

53:04.890 --> 53:07.017
[grunts] I want to punch you in the nose!

53:07.100 --> 53:09.853
I know you think you can treat me this way
because of your money.

53:09.936 --> 53:12.188
It doesn't matter how much money I make!

53:12.272 --> 53:16.693
You make me feel like a big piece of shit
because you don't care about it!

53:16.776 --> 53:18.653
But you also actually do!

53:18.737 --> 53:20.447
You're privately obsessed with it!

53:21.114 --> 53:22.616
You know that I beat you!

53:23.408 --> 53:24.826
I beat you!

53:24.910 --> 53:26.161
I beat...

53:33.668 --> 53:35.128
[Dr. Soni] It's quite startling.

53:35.211 --> 53:37.672
A collection of fluids
on the left side of his head

53:37.756 --> 53:40.050
was shoving the brain clear to the right.

53:40.133 --> 53:42.510
His brain experienced
so much pressure and irritation

53:42.594 --> 53:45.639
that he was in an almost comatose state
before we operated.

53:45.722 --> 53:49.809
There was still some bleeding in the left
frontal lobe, but no tissue was lost.

53:49.893 --> 53:53.146
The head trauma clogged up
the spinal fluid absorption pathways,

53:53.229 --> 53:57.275
which slows speech, causes lethargy,
headaches.

53:57.359 --> 53:59.861
This should have been taken care of
immediately after the trauma.

53:59.945 --> 54:02.656
Did you notice his wife
was heavily perfumed?

54:02.739 --> 54:06.076
-I think I smelled alcohol on her breath.
-Yes, I'm worried about her as well.

54:06.159 --> 54:08.411
I didn't realize anyone was here.
How's he doing?

54:08.495 --> 54:10.830
-He's sleeping.
-Not too much, sleeping. Shit! Sorry.

54:10.914 --> 54:13.416
-Good. You're family?
-Yes.

54:13.500 --> 54:16.795
-Maureen only told us this morning.
-Right when we heard. Via text.

54:16.878 --> 54:19.923
-They were in Maureen's country house?
-We drove from Rochester to Pittsfield.

54:20.006 --> 54:22.509
-We wanted to talk to a doctor.
-We haven't been able to get information.

54:22.592 --> 54:24.219
I'm Pam. This is Dr. Soni.

54:24.803 --> 54:26.262
-Hi, nice to meet you.
-Jean.

54:26.346 --> 54:27.514
-Hi, nice to meet you.
-Danny.

54:27.597 --> 54:29.849
[Jean] Dr. Soni, can you tell us
what's going on with our dad?

54:29.933 --> 54:31.518
When your mother's here,
we can go over it.

54:31.601 --> 54:32.435
She's our stepmother.

54:32.519 --> 54:33.937
She would've been seven
when she had me.

54:34.020 --> 54:35.730
Well, when your stepmother comes back.

54:35.814 --> 54:37.857
We can't find her.
She's not at the country house.

54:37.941 --> 54:40.235
-Her voicemail's full.
-Why can't you tell us right now?

54:41.611 --> 54:42.487
This is awkward.

54:42.570 --> 54:43.697
-What's awkward?
-What?

54:44.280 --> 54:46.741
I don't want to get involved
in family dynamics,

54:46.825 --> 54:48.827
but she told me not to talk
to anyone else.

54:48.910 --> 54:50.954
Well, that's not right, obviously.
We're his kids.

54:51.037 --> 54:53.581
-You can talk to us.
-No, that's what I'm saying.

54:53.665 --> 54:58.044
Since she's the next of kin, I legally
cannot talk to you. I'm very sorry.

54:58.628 --> 55:00.797
He has an opening on Monday.

55:01.464 --> 55:03.466
This is our first real hospital...

55:04.718 --> 55:06.052
[Dr. Soni] Talk to your stepmother.

55:09.222 --> 55:11.141
Why'd you tell the doctor
not to talk to us?

55:11.224 --> 55:12.809
Maureen, where have you been?

55:12.892 --> 55:14.561
Are you moving that way on purpose?

55:14.644 --> 55:17.647
What? No, it's always worse
after I've been sitting.

55:17.731 --> 55:20.191
-I thought you were mocking me.
-You don't walk that way.

55:20.275 --> 55:24.529
-I thought it was a bad imitation.
-We need to be able to talk to Dr. Soni.

55:24.612 --> 55:27.574
Dr. Soni looks very much
like a chum of mine at university

55:27.657 --> 55:30.910
who became an art looter,
but that's of no use to you.

55:30.994 --> 55:32.454
-No.
-Absolutely none.

55:32.537 --> 55:35.040
I'll get the information,
and you can ask me.

55:35.123 --> 55:38.084
Email might be best
if we're gonna be in Rochester.

55:38.168 --> 55:39.544
-I'm here, Danny's here.
-I'm here.

55:39.627 --> 55:42.672
You need to tell her it's okay
to speak to me or Danny or Matt,

55:42.756 --> 55:43.923
who's on his way.

55:44.007 --> 55:46.134
-Matt's coming?
-He texted me, I texted him.

55:46.217 --> 55:47.594
He texted you, you texted him.

55:47.677 --> 55:49.679
Do you think I'm not
gonna tell you the truth?

55:49.763 --> 55:51.014
-I can drive, Maureen.
-Jean...

55:51.931 --> 55:55.810
you were wearing that same sweater
that last time I saw you.

55:56.352 --> 55:57.228
Was I?

55:57.312 --> 56:00.023
Maureen, we've been sitting
in that room with him,

56:00.106 --> 56:03.943
and he's attached to those machines,
and there's a drain in his head,

56:04.027 --> 56:05.278
and he's unconscious,

56:05.862 --> 56:08.740
and we don't know where you are
or what's going on.

56:08.823 --> 56:10.366
Talk to the doc--

56:14.662 --> 56:15.997
[car door closes]

56:17.999 --> 56:19.292
[car beeps]

56:24.547 --> 56:26.382
Oh, hi. Still sleeping?

56:26.883 --> 56:28.218
I'm Pam, the nurse.

56:28.301 --> 56:30.220
Hey, I'm Matt, the son.

56:30.303 --> 56:32.097
Oh, I met your brother and sister.

56:32.180 --> 56:35.683
Half-brother and sister, yeah. Is he okay?

56:35.767 --> 56:39.896
Dr. Soni spoke with your stepmother,
and then your siblings... half-siblings,

56:39.979 --> 56:43.149
and it's all been cleared up,
and she can talk to you freely now.

56:43.233 --> 56:45.610
Oh, okay. How's he doing?

56:45.693 --> 56:48.154
Your father was brought to us
the night before last,

56:48.238 --> 56:51.157
but because he was taking baby aspirin,

56:51.241 --> 56:54.327
which thins the blood, Dr. Soni had
to wait until the morning to operate.

56:54.410 --> 56:55.537
What happened?

56:55.620 --> 56:58.039
He had a chronic subdural hematoma,

56:58.123 --> 57:02.335
which meant in his case there had been
steady bleeding in his head for some time.

57:02.418 --> 57:03.503
How did he get this?

57:03.586 --> 57:07.882
Something like this generally can happen
from a fall, or if he hit his head.

57:07.966 --> 57:12.262
He fell about four months ago.
Bruno pulled him onto a path.

57:12.637 --> 57:15.098
Honestly, I'm surprised
he had such a delayed response.

57:15.181 --> 57:17.725
He must have a real tolerance
for discomfort.

57:19.310 --> 57:20.478
Will he be okay?

57:20.562 --> 57:21.938
Well, because he waited so long,

57:22.021 --> 57:24.816
there was quite a bit of irritation
in the frontal lobe,

57:24.899 --> 57:27.944
and now that the pressure's
off the brain, it causes severe agitation.

57:28.027 --> 57:29.487
The frontal lobe has language,

57:29.571 --> 57:32.198
but it's potentially
a hundred percent recoverable.

57:32.907 --> 57:34.868
He was very responsive this morning.

57:34.951 --> 57:38.580
He was identifying objects. I showed him
a flashlight, he said, "Flashlight."

57:39.247 --> 57:40.206
Oh, I'll leave you guys.

57:41.666 --> 57:43.168
Oh. Thanks, Pam.

57:45.295 --> 57:46.212
Hey.

57:48.381 --> 57:49.549
Do you know my name?

57:50.508 --> 57:52.677
Of course, it's Matthew.

57:54.137 --> 57:55.388
Um...

57:57.182 --> 57:58.308
What is this?

57:59.934 --> 58:01.102
Blackberry.

58:02.395 --> 58:03.480
Yes.

58:06.191 --> 58:07.233
This is...

58:12.405 --> 58:13.323
What, Dad?

58:17.327 --> 58:18.328
This...

58:20.538 --> 58:21.623
You...

58:23.333 --> 58:25.084
It's okay, we don't have to talk.

58:27.045 --> 58:28.254
I can say it.

58:31.257 --> 58:32.967
You're here...

58:35.887 --> 58:37.430
is what I wanted.

58:41.434 --> 58:43.937
How... are you feeling?

58:45.188 --> 58:46.523
I'm happy...

58:48.900 --> 58:50.777
I'm happy you're here.

58:54.697 --> 58:57.158
Yeah, I took a red-eye when I heard.

58:59.786 --> 59:01.621
I'm sorry we...

59:08.044 --> 59:09.546
I'm sorry this happened.

59:13.841 --> 59:15.969
When is my...

59:18.721 --> 59:19.806
Your opening?

59:22.767 --> 59:23.977
It's on Monday.

59:26.312 --> 59:28.106
Is that today?

59:28.189 --> 59:29.983
No, today is Wednesday.

59:35.905 --> 59:37.574
Will it happen?

59:38.992 --> 59:40.785
It will happen, Dad.

59:42.745 --> 59:44.581
I don't know if you'll be able go.

59:48.084 --> 59:49.168
Will you?

59:51.546 --> 59:52.839
Sure, I'll go.

59:57.051 --> 59:59.262
You speak for me.

01:00:00.763 --> 01:00:02.515
Yeah, I can say something, yes.

01:00:06.603 --> 01:00:07.854
It's yours.

01:00:12.650 --> 01:00:14.277
We made it together.

01:00:19.407 --> 01:00:21.743
I have a meeting in the city
which I really need to get to.

01:00:21.826 --> 01:00:22.785
-Okay.
-That's okay, right?

01:00:22.869 --> 01:00:25.872
-Sure.
-He's okay, right? I'm not abandoning him?

01:00:25.955 --> 01:00:28.875
-I can't really answer that.
-I just have this client meeting.

01:00:28.958 --> 01:00:30.877
-I understand.
-He's okay, right?

01:00:31.461 --> 01:00:32.712
I think so, yeah.

01:00:32.795 --> 01:00:35.548
I left my number in the room.
Call me if anything changes.

01:00:37.342 --> 01:00:38.426
[Tony]  Where you are?

01:00:38.509 --> 01:00:41.304
[Matthew]
I'm in Pittsfield. It's in Massachusetts.

01:00:41.387 --> 01:00:42.930
Is that like New York?

01:00:43.014 --> 01:00:44.724
Well, it's a different state.

01:00:44.807 --> 01:00:46.643
It's sunny here. What is it there?

01:00:46.726 --> 01:00:47.644
Rainy.

01:00:47.727 --> 01:00:50.772
You can't fight the weather.
You can fight knights.

01:00:50.855 --> 01:00:52.940
-Yeah.
-And ninjas.

01:00:53.024 --> 01:00:55.485
Do you know who's good
at playing ninjas? Jim.

01:00:55.568 --> 01:00:58.154
-Who's Jim?
-He's the handyman.

01:00:58.237 --> 01:00:59.238
I've never heard of Jim.

01:00:59.322 --> 01:01:01.783
You used to live here,
but you don't anymore.

01:01:01.866 --> 01:01:03.660
If you did, you would know Jim.

01:01:03.743 --> 01:01:05.411
Do you see a lot of Jim?

01:01:05.495 --> 01:01:08.039
He comes on weekends.
Is this a weekend?

01:01:08.122 --> 01:01:09.582
In three days it's a weekend.

01:01:09.666 --> 01:01:11.334
Three days, that's three weeks.

01:01:11.417 --> 01:01:14.462
No, sweetheart, it's three days.
Does Jim stay over?

01:01:14.545 --> 01:01:16.339
No, Jim doesn't sleep.

01:01:16.422 --> 01:01:20.760
He stays up all night with Mommy
eating dinner and leaves in the morning.

01:01:20.843 --> 01:01:22.345
Hold on, I'm getting another call.

01:01:22.428 --> 01:01:25.348
Raise your hand
if ninjas are your favorite thing.

01:01:25.431 --> 01:01:27.350
-Okay, just wait a second, sweetheart.
-Okay, bye now.

01:01:28.851 --> 01:01:29.769
Hello?

01:01:33.898 --> 01:01:35.358
Maybe if he hears it?

01:01:35.441 --> 01:01:38.403
Danny, stop. It doesn't help.
Do you know who this is?

01:01:38.486 --> 01:01:39.654
It's all right.

01:01:39.737 --> 01:01:42.115
Do you remember when you said, "Danny?"

01:01:42.198 --> 01:01:45.284
-You have to stop giving him the answers.
-It's all right.

01:01:45.368 --> 01:01:46.536
Who's this?

01:01:46.619 --> 01:01:48.079
It's all right.

01:01:48.162 --> 01:01:51.082
-Oh, no.
-It's Matt. He just got here.

01:01:51.165 --> 01:01:54.293
-Stop giving him the answers.
-So, how are we doing?

01:01:54.377 --> 01:01:56.838
-[Harold] It's all right.
-Where's Pam?

01:01:56.921 --> 01:01:58.464
-Pam Engels or Pam Chin?
-I don't know.

01:01:58.548 --> 01:02:00.258
I was just here. He knew
what a Blackberry was

01:02:00.341 --> 01:02:02.009
and could say my name and everything.

01:02:02.093 --> 01:02:03.553
We talked about his show.

01:02:03.636 --> 01:02:05.221
You were here? Where were you?

01:02:05.304 --> 01:02:08.850
Sometimes they can take a little while
to come back from these surgeries.

01:02:08.933 --> 01:02:10.143
No, he was already back.

01:02:10.226 --> 01:02:13.187
I'm sorry, who are you?
Who is everybody? I just got here.

01:02:13.271 --> 01:02:14.856
-We're his kids.
-Where's Pam?

01:02:14.939 --> 01:02:18.151
-I wasn't here so I don't know.
-I was, that's what I'm telling you.

01:02:18.234 --> 01:02:20.486
Why didn't you call us? Where'd you go?

01:02:20.570 --> 01:02:23.656
Heading back to the city for a meeting,
and I turned around when Pam called.

01:02:23.740 --> 01:02:25.783
Tiredness can cause this,
and his blood pressure is high.

01:02:25.867 --> 01:02:29.370
This isn't tiredness. Something's wrong.
Where's... Can't we find Pam?

01:02:29.454 --> 01:02:30.955
No, I'm the charge nurse.

01:02:31.038 --> 01:02:33.958
-You were here. Why didn't you call us?
-Because it never occurred to me.

01:02:34.041 --> 01:02:35.960
-Where's Dr. Soni?
-She's on her rounds.

01:02:36.043 --> 01:02:38.004
Something is happening to my father.

01:02:38.921 --> 01:02:41.591
-I want Pam!
-Okay, you're gonna have to stop shouting.

01:02:41.674 --> 01:02:43.593
-We're sorry, he's just emotional.
-It's our dad.

01:02:43.676 --> 01:02:45.720
I'm not emotional, Danny! I want Pam!

01:02:45.803 --> 01:02:48.806
Right now we're waiting for a neurologist
to read his EEG for brainwave activity.

01:02:48.890 --> 01:02:50.975
-When will that happen?
-I don't know. It's being read in India.

01:02:51.642 --> 01:02:53.102
Because of... Why?

01:02:53.186 --> 01:02:55.646
In the meantime, I'm gonna give him
Lotensin for his high blood pressure.

01:02:55.730 --> 01:02:56.939
I'll be right back.

01:02:57.023 --> 01:02:58.024
Okay.

01:02:58.107 --> 01:03:00.526
He's giving him Lotensin. What did he get
for his blood pressure before?

01:03:02.236 --> 01:03:04.405
The other nurse came by.
She did something.

01:03:04.489 --> 01:03:06.949
-Yeah, she seemed to know.
-Did you write it down?

01:03:08.117 --> 01:03:09.952
-I can't remember.
-Me neither.

01:03:10.036 --> 01:03:12.538
From now on, everything gets written down.
Do you understand?

01:03:12.622 --> 01:03:16.626
It's one thing!
You can read what the number is now.

01:03:16.709 --> 01:03:17.960
He's alive!

01:03:18.044 --> 01:03:20.213
Jesus, these people do this for a living.

01:03:20.296 --> 01:03:22.215
These people change every five minutes.

01:03:22.298 --> 01:03:24.759
If we're not paying attention,
he might die.

01:03:24.842 --> 01:03:27.053
-Do you understand that?
-I do.

01:03:27.136 --> 01:03:29.013
-Jesus.
-I'll write everything down.

01:03:29.096 --> 01:03:30.598
-Everything.
-Yeah.

01:03:30.681 --> 01:03:32.391
-I got it!
-I'm sorry!

01:03:32.475 --> 01:03:33.601
It's okay!

01:03:36.145 --> 01:03:37.647
It's nice to see you, Matt.

01:03:41.901 --> 01:03:45.738
The lost speech could be
because of frequent or partial seizures.

01:03:46.113 --> 01:03:50.743
An up and down is common,
but this is more of a down than expected.

01:03:50.827 --> 01:03:52.870
If it was his heart,
we'd shock him out of it,

01:03:52.954 --> 01:03:54.705
but you can't shock the brain
in these cases,

01:03:54.789 --> 01:03:56.916
so we need to quiet the brain.

01:03:58.793 --> 01:04:01.504
We're putting him in a barbiturate coma,

01:04:01.587 --> 01:04:05.591
with a combination of propofol
and pentobarbital or phenobarbital.

01:04:05.675 --> 01:04:08.010
Probably pento. I want to be aggressive.

01:04:08.094 --> 01:04:09.595
Will he be okay?

01:04:09.679 --> 01:04:13.641
Think of it like shutting down a computer
and then restarting.

01:04:13.724 --> 01:04:17.395
Or, if you're a Luddite like me,
like a grain of sand becoming a pearl.

01:04:17.478 --> 01:04:18.604
[Jean chuckles]

01:04:19.730 --> 01:04:20.940
Will he be okay?

01:04:21.440 --> 01:04:23.776
Well, it's not what we'd hope
at this stage.

01:04:24.402 --> 01:04:27.113
Because he'll be completely sedated,
we'll need to intubate.

01:04:28.281 --> 01:04:30.700
I want you to know
we're doing our very best.

01:04:30.783 --> 01:04:33.327
We want to see your father
walking out of here soon.

01:04:33.411 --> 01:04:35.413
Thank you, Dr. Soni.

01:04:35.496 --> 01:04:38.165
Now, I'm going to be on vacation
for three weeks starting tomorrow.

01:04:38.249 --> 01:04:39.166
-What?!
-Really?

01:04:39.250 --> 01:04:40.293
Are you serious?

01:04:40.376 --> 01:04:42.753
He'll be in very good care.
Dr. Brotman will be taking over.

01:04:42.837 --> 01:04:44.547
-"Dr. Brotman."
-Do you have to go?

01:04:44.630 --> 01:04:46.465
-Can't you just push it?
-We need you here!

01:04:46.549 --> 01:04:49.218
God, no. My husband would divorce me.
We're going to China.

01:04:49.302 --> 01:04:52.513
You're putting our dad in a coma
and then leaving us?

01:04:52.597 --> 01:04:56.475
It's not like that, Matt. It's not.
Right, Dr. Soni? It's not like that?

01:04:56.559 --> 01:04:59.228
Well, technically, yes. It's that.

01:04:59.312 --> 01:05:01.230
-You can't do that to us!
-First Pam, now you?

01:05:01.314 --> 01:05:04.025
-Can we get Pam back at least?
-I'm not in charge of nurse assignments.

01:05:04.108 --> 01:05:05.443
-Hi, Dr. Soni.
-Hi, Dr. Liu.

01:05:05.526 --> 01:05:09.363
-Shouldn't you be packing for China?
-It doesn't feel fair, Dr. Soni,

01:05:09.447 --> 01:05:13.659
that you can just live your life normally
while our dad is lying here.

01:05:14.869 --> 01:05:16.162
Maybe it isn't.

01:05:16.245 --> 01:05:18.915
I'm gonna stay a few days
until Dad's opening at Bard.

01:05:18.998 --> 01:05:20.666
Stay with us at Maureen's house.

01:05:21.751 --> 01:05:22.877
Okay.

01:05:22.960 --> 01:05:24.879
Dad says you started your own company.

01:05:24.962 --> 01:05:27.173
-Yeah, a couple of other guys and me...
-How does that work?

01:05:27.256 --> 01:05:29.342
Did you just tell your boss,
"I'm gonna start my own..."

01:05:29.425 --> 01:05:32.345
I was one of the partners,
so I didn't technically have a boss.

01:05:32.428 --> 01:05:34.972
No, I understand.
So, you got a better offer?

01:05:35.056 --> 01:05:37.266
No, there were no offers.
That's what was so scary.

01:05:37.350 --> 01:05:38.935
We were creating our own opportunity.

01:05:39.018 --> 01:05:42.188
-Because you wanted something smaller.
-Bigger.

01:05:42.271 --> 01:05:45.232
-Many of the firm's clients came with us.
-Which was surprising.

01:05:45.316 --> 01:05:47.985
No, we expected it. We can't legally
ask clients to come with us...

01:05:48.069 --> 01:05:49.528
But they don't have much choice.

01:05:50.279 --> 01:05:51.697
It's totally their choice.

01:05:51.781 --> 01:05:53.658
No, I know. Because you have their money.

01:05:53.741 --> 01:05:55.034
Well, their money's with the firm,

01:05:55.117 --> 01:05:57.036
but their money is in investments
or a bank.

01:05:57.119 --> 01:06:00.831
I understand. My buddy Ptolemy,
who lives across the street, or lived...

01:06:00.915 --> 01:06:02.375
Dad told me about your...

01:06:02.458 --> 01:06:06.462
-Karen? I'm sorry. I've also...
-Ptolemy's like you, works in arbitrage.

01:06:07.296 --> 01:06:09.382
Yeah, that's not what I do.

01:06:09.465 --> 01:06:10.508
No, I wasn't saying...

01:06:10.591 --> 01:06:14.637
But Ptolemy said
that the system is rigged from the inside.

01:06:15.096 --> 01:06:17.098
-That's not entirely true.
-But mostly?

01:06:17.181 --> 01:06:20.059
-So, this is an exciting time for me.
-How's your boy?

01:06:21.060 --> 01:06:22.311
Good.

01:06:22.395 --> 01:06:24.021
Victoria and I are having some problems.

01:06:24.105 --> 01:06:26.899
I never met her. Karen and I separated.

01:06:27.233 --> 01:06:29.735
-I know. I just said I was sorry.
-Did you?

01:06:29.819 --> 01:06:30.945
I'm sorry, too.

01:06:31.445 --> 01:06:34.240
-I liked Eliza's movie.
-She sent it to you?

01:06:34.323 --> 01:06:35.616
-Are you limping?
-Yes!

01:06:35.700 --> 01:06:37.410
It's always stiff after I've been sitting.

01:06:37.994 --> 01:06:39.912
-You should see the other dog.
-What?

01:06:41.247 --> 01:06:42.081
[Matthew] Nothing.

01:06:42.164 --> 01:06:44.500
[Danny] I borrowed an old cane
from Maureen's dead ex-husband,

01:06:44.583 --> 01:06:45.918
but it's really not necessary.

01:06:46.002 --> 01:06:48.587
I keep it in the car. I'm telling you.

01:06:53.092 --> 01:06:54.677
-It's tax season.
-Yeah.

01:06:55.344 --> 01:06:56.846
-Okay.
-There's a step!

01:06:56.929 --> 01:06:58.973
-Thank you.
-Jean, there's a step.

01:06:59.056 --> 01:07:04.145
I left the necks on for those of you
who are feeling... adventurous.

01:07:04.228 --> 01:07:06.647
Evidently, they net them.

01:07:06.731 --> 01:07:10.526
They net whole trees, and they just
take off with the little birds,

01:07:10.609 --> 01:07:13.237
and just deep fry them, and just...
[makes explosion sound]

01:07:13.320 --> 01:07:15.114
It's very sad.

01:07:15.197 --> 01:07:18.784
I've never known little birds
that didn't mind leaving the home.

01:07:21.454 --> 01:07:24.582
The Knicks totally started, but then got
to the point with one player away.

01:07:24.665 --> 01:07:26.459
-Yeah.
-The Knicks need a point guard.

01:07:26.542 --> 01:07:27.543
I'll take two.

01:07:29.628 --> 01:07:30.796
Would you fuck Pam?

01:07:32.006 --> 01:07:32.965
I would.

01:07:34.800 --> 01:07:35.885

a photo of me as a child.

He's okay. He doesn't know anything.

01:08:21.138 --> 01:08:23.099
Dad's blood pressure is 178...

01:08:26.185 --> 01:08:29.395
His blood pressure dropped,
so they put him on a Levophed drip,

01:08:29.479 --> 01:08:31.314
but that's hard on his kidneys so...

01:08:31.398 --> 01:08:35.653

It was a little gooey.

sepsis, which is a full-body inflammation.

Unfortunately, the longer he's here,
the more susceptible he is to infection.

Do we have an EEG?

01:08:54.380 --> 01:08:56.631
This is a different unit.
We're in the ICU.

01:08:56.715 --> 01:08:58.300
I don't have those answers as of yet.

01:08:58.384 --> 01:09:00.886
So now we're in the right unit
to treat his sepsis,

01:09:00.970 --> 01:09:02.680
but the wrong unit to treat his head?

01:09:02.763 --> 01:09:06.433
They have a call in to a neurologist.
People rarely come in on the weekends.

-Hi, Tony, remember me?

01:10:13.417 --> 01:10:16.212
-We've never actually met.
-This is Eliza, your cousin.

-Wait.

Oh, shit!

I'm oddly growing fond of this cafeteria,

-Call him back.
-I don't want to. It makes me feel bad.

01:10:32.311 --> 01:10:34.188
He's five years old, they hate phones.

01:10:34.271 --> 01:10:37.191
Eliza, when you were that age,
you'd never talk on the phone.

01:10:37.274 --> 01:10:38.692
She makes it too difficult.

01:10:38.776 --> 01:10:41.570
I don't know, sometimes I think
maybe I sit this kid out,

01:10:41.654 --> 01:10:45.324
start another family,
and then he finds me at 21.

01:10:45.407 --> 01:10:46.659
Let him come to me.

into dating you.

01:11:01.298 --> 01:11:03.634
-Where'd you get manicotti?
-We're already at a doctor.

01:11:03.717 --> 01:11:04.843
You really should, Dan.

01:11:04.927 --> 01:11:06.971
-I know what it is, okay?
-What is it?

01:11:07.054 --> 01:11:09.974
It's... I mean, I basically know.

01:11:10.057 --> 01:11:13.185
-Dad, you gotta deal with it.
-I know. I've been telling him that.

01:11:13.269 --> 01:11:14.603
-Yeah, look at Dad.
-Right?

01:11:14.687 --> 01:11:18.107
-He ignored his thing.
-Just let me eat my fucking banana. Okay?

01:11:18.190 --> 01:11:19.400
You should call your son.

01:11:25.948 --> 01:11:27.449
-Hi, Matt!
-Hi, Maureen.

01:11:34.540 --> 01:11:36.542
[car thuds, beeps]

01:11:37.334 --> 01:11:38.377
Maureen!

01:11:40.671 --> 01:11:43.924
[Maureen] It's a shame the Dad
is gonna miss the opening tomorrow.

01:11:44.008 --> 01:11:47.720
-He was really looking forward to it.
-Dad asked me to say something.

01:11:47.803 --> 01:11:49.763
I was gonna ask Danny and Jean, too.

01:11:49.847 --> 01:11:52.891
He would never have expected you
to have shown up.

01:11:52.975 --> 01:11:56.603
We were trying to figure it out. Have you
ever even been to this house before?

01:11:57.146 --> 01:11:58.147
No.

01:11:59.982 --> 01:12:01.650
The Dad always hoped for a visit,

01:12:01.734 --> 01:12:05.612
but I guess you always had a lot to do
in the city when you came to town,

01:12:05.696 --> 01:12:08.407
and us, not being
the A-list parents and all.

01:12:08.490 --> 01:12:11.118
Danny and Jean, of course,
are here all the time,

01:12:11.201 --> 01:12:13.787
but that's less exciting for the Dad.

01:12:13.871 --> 01:12:16.832
I reached out to some of his old friends,
who are going to come visit.

01:12:16.915 --> 01:12:20.127
Well, I hope they understand
they'll be looking at a sleeping man.

01:12:20.210 --> 01:12:21.545
Hello, Andy Warhol.

01:12:21.628 --> 01:12:24.006
I explained that in so many words.

01:12:24.089 --> 01:12:26.550
I spoke to Dr. Diebert, the neurologist,

01:12:26.633 --> 01:12:29.636
who seems very knowledgeable
but has no upper lip to speak of,

01:12:29.720 --> 01:12:32.181
and if Harold survives the infection,

01:12:32.264 --> 01:12:34.975
they have no idea what person
will be in there when he wakes up.

01:12:35.059 --> 01:12:37.227
Maybe he'll be Brad Pitt...

01:12:37.811 --> 01:12:39.813
or Neruda

01:12:39.897 --> 01:12:42.149
or Joe the Plumber, I...

01:12:44.401 --> 01:12:46.403
I just want him to be Harold.

01:12:47.279 --> 01:12:49.615
Have you looked over
the documents I sent you?

01:12:49.698 --> 01:12:50.783
Yes.

01:12:51.700 --> 01:12:55.954
And... given where we are with the Dad,

01:12:56.038 --> 01:12:59.333
and the Manhattan house
is more than we need right now,

01:13:00.125 --> 01:13:03.504
I've taken your counsel, and I think
selling the house and the art

01:13:03.587 --> 01:13:06.131
to James and Brian
is the right thing to do.

01:13:06.215 --> 01:13:11.553
So, I signed the places
that you marked for me.

01:13:12.221 --> 01:13:13.389
[Matthew] Great, then it's done.

01:13:13.972 --> 01:13:17.684
[Maureen] Some pieces are quite large.
How will they be displayed?

01:13:20.145 --> 01:13:23.816
James' family owns a series of retirement
communities around the country,

01:13:23.899 --> 01:13:27.736
and they're going to donate the art
to these facilities as a write-off.

01:13:27.820 --> 01:13:29.113
[Maureen] Oh.

01:13:29.780 --> 01:13:30.781
Okay.

01:13:31.657 --> 01:13:34.493
I can't believe Danny is happy about that.

01:13:35.369 --> 01:13:36.412
And Jean...

01:13:38.038 --> 01:13:40.666
Who knows what Jean feels
about anything.

01:13:41.625 --> 01:13:42.960
Well, with Dad's illness,

01:13:43.043 --> 01:13:47.089
I thought I'd wait till after the show
to tell them anything, just...

01:13:47.172 --> 01:13:49.341
I don't know,
there's just been so much going on.

01:13:49.425 --> 01:13:51.552
Really, they have no power anyway.

01:13:51.635 --> 01:13:54.012
I don't know what happened to them
as children.

01:13:54.096 --> 01:13:57.599
Harold says he tried his best,
but they're really such disappointments.

01:13:58.350 --> 01:14:00.102
Nobody took care of them.

01:14:00.185 --> 01:14:03.230
I say that as a disappointment, myself.

01:14:03.313 --> 01:14:05.607
I was neglected too during my childhood.

01:14:07.067 --> 01:14:08.402
It's funny,

01:14:08.485 --> 01:14:10.696
I was never interested in having kids.

01:14:11.321 --> 01:14:12.239
Maybe once...

01:14:13.782 --> 01:14:14.950
No, not even once.

01:14:15.033 --> 01:14:17.327
Eliza texted she came early
to be with Dad.

01:14:17.411 --> 01:14:18.370
She texted you?

01:14:18.454 --> 01:14:20.372
The curator is meeting us at Bard at 1,

01:14:20.456 --> 01:14:24.376
so let's get Eliza, say our goodbyes
to Dad, and get on the road.

01:14:24.793 --> 01:14:27.421
Oh, good, Paul came.

01:14:28.505 --> 01:14:29.965
Paul Epstein.

01:14:30.591 --> 01:14:31.842
I always liked Paul.

01:14:33.218 --> 01:14:35.387
Man, he's gotten... older.

01:14:35.971 --> 01:14:38.098
I'm glad Dad still has friends.

01:14:38.182 --> 01:14:39.766
I'm gonna go say hi.

01:14:39.850 --> 01:14:42.394
Jean, remember Paul and Laurie?

01:14:43.103 --> 01:14:44.563
Jean?

01:14:46.732 --> 01:14:48.567
I don't think I've ever seen Jean run.

01:14:49.151 --> 01:14:50.944
Yeah, that's how she runs.

01:14:55.991 --> 01:14:59.536
You remember that summer I visited Dad
on Martha's Vineyard?

01:14:59.620 --> 01:15:02.456
Dad never invited me or Danny
to the summer places.

01:15:02.539 --> 01:15:04.625
-Never.
-But that summer I was a camp counselor

01:15:04.708 --> 01:15:07.002
-at French Woods in Vermont.
-[Danny] The one with Alisa Lirtzman?

01:15:07.085 --> 01:15:10.255
No, that was Thoreau.
I was only at this one for one summer.

01:15:10.339 --> 01:15:15.636
And I had two days off and I called him,
and he couldn't say no.

01:15:15.719 --> 01:15:17.763
He must have gotten permission
from your mother.

01:15:18.764 --> 01:15:21.350
It wasn't as convenient as I had thought.

01:15:21.433 --> 01:15:24.186
I had to take two buses and a ferry.

01:15:24.686 --> 01:15:26.188
When I arrived, nobody met me.

01:15:26.271 --> 01:15:28.565
I hitchhiked to the other side
of the island.

01:15:29.858 --> 01:15:33.111
When I got to the house,
it was already night.

01:15:33.195 --> 01:15:35.697
The adults were all going out for dinner:

01:15:35.781 --> 01:15:41.453
Dad and your mom, and L.J. and Maya,
and Paul and Laurie.

01:15:42.204 --> 01:15:45.374
Julia said something about me
having my bags in the way.

01:15:46.375 --> 01:15:50.212
They were happy to have a babysitter,
so they left me with the kids.

01:15:50.796 --> 01:15:55.968
You were there, Matthew, and Loretta
and some other kids I didn't know.

01:15:56.760 --> 01:15:58.971
We watched  Three's Company  on TV.

01:16:00.347 --> 01:16:04.184
The next day, Dad played tennis
and worked in his studio.

01:16:04.977 --> 01:16:06.770
I went down to the beach with the kids.

01:16:06.853 --> 01:16:11.900
I got to swim in the ocean,
which was really special for me.

01:16:11.984 --> 01:16:13.318
I loved that.

01:16:14.319 --> 01:16:18.156
Later, I showered in the outdoor shower
with my suit on,

01:16:18.240 --> 01:16:21.076
and I realized someone was watching me.

01:16:21.535 --> 01:16:22.995
It was Paul.

01:16:23.829 --> 01:16:26.248
He smiled at me, almost politely,

01:16:26.331 --> 01:16:29.501
and then he lowered
his tight bathing suit,

01:16:29.585 --> 01:16:32.838
took out his penis,
and started stroking it.

01:16:32.921 --> 01:16:34.256
-Paul did?!
-Oh, God.

01:16:34.339 --> 01:16:37.926
I watched him until he finished,
and then he walked away.

01:16:38.010 --> 01:16:39.428
Did you tell anyone?

01:16:39.511 --> 01:16:40.762
I told Dad that night.

01:16:41.430 --> 01:16:44.433
He asked if Paul had touched me,
and I said no.

01:16:44.516 --> 01:16:46.393
He thought we should probably
just leave it then.

01:16:46.476 --> 01:16:49.271
They were going back to the city
soon anyway,

01:16:49.354 --> 01:16:52.524
but that if Paul did it again,
he'd punch him in the nose.

01:16:53.525 --> 01:16:57.362
The next day when I was leaving,
I looked around for Dad to say goodbye,

01:16:57.446 --> 01:16:59.615
but he was playing tennis.

01:17:00.198 --> 01:17:03.076
I thought about telling your mom, Matthew,

01:17:03.160 --> 01:17:06.204
but I was afraid she'd get angry at me.

01:17:07.247 --> 01:17:10.709
I remember crying on my way to the ferry.

01:17:11.960 --> 01:17:13.587
Jean, can I ask you a question?

01:17:14.421 --> 01:17:16.465
Why do you always show up for Dad?

01:17:16.965 --> 01:17:18.133
Why are you always here?

01:17:20.927 --> 01:17:22.846
Because I'm a decent person.

01:17:23.639 --> 01:17:27.893
Even though he never took care of us,
it's what you do.

01:17:30.228 --> 01:17:33.649
Besides, I like hanging out with you guys.

01:17:38.695 --> 01:17:39.696
Come here.

01:17:39.780 --> 01:17:41.907
I'm going for a smoke.

01:17:46.453 --> 01:17:49.498
-Do we kick the shit out of him?
-He's 80, we'd kill him.

01:17:49.581 --> 01:17:51.625
That's true, or hurt him very badly.

01:17:51.708 --> 01:17:54.252
-And neither of us could take that nurse.
-That's for sure.

01:17:55.003 --> 01:17:56.630
I'm gonna... spit on him.

01:17:56.713 --> 01:17:58.423
No, I know what to do.

01:18:07.766 --> 01:18:08.767
Ow!

01:18:08.850 --> 01:18:11.436
But good, too. You got to try this.

01:18:13.855 --> 01:18:17.526
Shit, this is Maureen's
dead ex-husband's cane.

01:18:28.453 --> 01:18:29.371
Ah!

01:18:29.454 --> 01:18:30.664
[grunts]

01:18:46.388 --> 01:18:48.724
I've never done anything like this.

01:18:48.807 --> 01:18:50.183
Ha ha!

01:18:50.267 --> 01:18:51.351
Me neither.

01:18:52.394 --> 01:18:53.603
-Yeah, man!
-I'm with you!

01:18:53.687 --> 01:18:55.856
-Fucking yeah, right?
-I'm telling you.

01:18:56.440 --> 01:18:57.983
What's that, blood? Who's bleeding?

01:18:58.066 --> 01:18:59.735
-I don't see it.
-Your hand.

01:18:59.818 --> 01:19:00.694
Oh, yeah!

01:19:00.777 --> 01:19:01.820
-Your face!
-Yeah?

01:19:01.903 --> 01:19:02.738
Yeah!

01:19:02.821 --> 01:19:05.031
-That felt great.
-I don't know why we don't do that more.

01:19:05.115 --> 01:19:06.867
-Probably in the...
-Pam!

01:19:07.743 --> 01:19:10.704
-It's her!
-Oh, Pam!

01:19:12.622 --> 01:19:16.376
So last night his blood pressure was 173,
but they gave him hydralazine.

01:19:16.460 --> 01:19:19.212
-And an extra dose of Lopressor.
-We got it down to 155.

01:19:19.296 --> 01:19:21.173
-Oh, good.
-Oh, that sounds okay?

01:19:21.256 --> 01:19:24.217
-Yeah, he's also on Keppra and morphine.
-It's in our notes.

01:19:24.801 --> 01:19:26.511
-He has sepsis, Pam.
-Oh, no.

01:19:26.595 --> 01:19:28.638
-Yeah. That was after the coma.
-Oh, I'm sorry.

01:19:28.722 --> 01:19:30.724
Drug induced, phenobarbital.

01:19:30.807 --> 01:19:33.351
-Pento, actually.
-I thought it was phenobarbital.

01:19:33.435 --> 01:19:35.812
What does it matter? We don't know
what either of them are anyway.

01:19:35.896 --> 01:19:37.981
Okay. Well, I'll make sure
to look in on him.

01:19:38.064 --> 01:19:41.526
It's so good to see you.
Please, come back to our unit.

01:19:41.610 --> 01:19:43.653
-Are you bleeding?
-Yes.

01:19:44.237 --> 01:19:45.781
Yeah. Hey.

01:19:47.741 --> 01:19:48.909
I am too, Pam.

01:19:50.702 --> 01:19:52.996
How's Dr. Soni? Still on vacation?

01:19:53.079 --> 01:19:55.916
-Oh, I don't know.
-Oh, okay.

01:19:55.999 --> 01:19:58.835
-Say hi. That was nice.
-She's awesome.

01:20:00.545 --> 01:20:03.715
I'll be back in two weekends, okay?
I love you.

01:20:03.799 --> 01:20:05.050
[sobbing]

01:20:05.133 --> 01:20:06.510
I forgive you.

01:20:07.344 --> 01:20:08.637
-Forgive me.
-Come on!

01:20:09.763 --> 01:20:11.431
-We should be getting on, too.
-No!

01:20:11.515 --> 01:20:14.601
Could you stay at least ten
or fifteen minutes more, you think?

01:20:14.684 --> 01:20:17.979
-Is that Harold's brothers?
-His sons, Danny and Matthew.

01:20:18.063 --> 01:20:19.397
You look just like him.

01:20:20.607 --> 01:20:21.942
-Are you bleeding?
-Come on.

01:20:22.025 --> 01:20:23.527
-What's going on?
-Let's go tell Jean.

01:20:23.610 --> 01:20:25.487
-Just run! Run!
-Why are we running?

01:20:27.322 --> 01:20:28.448
Smashed it.

01:20:28.532 --> 01:20:29.449
-What?
-Look!

01:20:29.533 --> 01:20:31.618
-He has dementia.
-We thought you'd be happy!

01:20:31.701 --> 01:20:35.664
Why would I be happy about this?
You smashed a sick old man's car.

01:20:35.747 --> 01:20:36.832
-He has dementia?
-Yeah.

01:20:36.915 --> 01:20:39.167
-Let's get you a bandage.
-I don't want a bandage.

01:20:39.251 --> 01:20:42.420
-I want to let it bleed. Let's go to Bard!
-He has dementia.

01:20:42.504 --> 01:20:44.631
Well, he didn't have dementia
when he molested Jean.

01:20:44.714 --> 01:20:48.718
-He didn't molest me.
-But let's not minimize it, Jean.

01:20:48.802 --> 01:20:51.888
What he did was shitty and damaging,
and, I don't know,

01:20:51.972 --> 01:20:55.684
the same asshole's in there somewhere,
right? Beneath the dementia.

01:20:55.767 --> 01:20:59.604
I'm glad you guys feel better.
Unfortunately, I'm still fucked up.

01:20:59.688 --> 01:21:00.939
You want to take a swing?

01:21:01.022 --> 01:21:02.941
I could smash every car
in this parking lot

01:21:03.024 --> 01:21:06.361
and burn the hospital down
and it wouldn't un-fuck me up.

01:21:07.195 --> 01:21:11.449
You guys will never understand
what it's like to be me in this family.

01:21:13.451 --> 01:21:14.703
Let's go to Bard.

01:21:24.629 --> 01:21:26.965
This toast is really stressing me out.

01:21:27.757 --> 01:21:29.885
Jean, you sure
you don't want to say anything?

01:21:29.968 --> 01:21:31.428
-Fuck no.
-Okay.

01:21:33.013 --> 01:21:35.307
I've had these for a while,
but I think they're still good. Want one?

01:21:35.390 --> 01:21:37.976
-What'll they do to me?
-Either bring you up or down.

01:21:38.059 --> 01:21:39.394
Hopefully down, I guess.

01:21:39.477 --> 01:21:40.937
Someone took a bite already.

01:21:41.021 --> 01:21:43.273
That was me.
I had a crumb when I last saw Dad.

01:21:43.356 --> 01:21:45.775
Okay. What did it do to you then?

01:21:46.651 --> 01:21:49.070
Just made me annoyed at Dad.
I don't know.

01:21:58.788 --> 01:22:00.123
[Danny] What about Marcus?

01:22:00.206 --> 01:22:01.249
They broke up.

01:22:01.791 --> 01:22:03.084
How do you know that?

01:22:03.668 --> 01:22:05.754
This woman keeps smiling at me.

01:22:05.837 --> 01:22:07.672
I'm getting a real energy from her.

01:22:09.507 --> 01:22:12.218
-She's walking over here.
-I look okay?

01:22:12.302 --> 01:22:13.428
Yeah, you look handsome.

01:22:15.388 --> 01:22:17.641
Are you Harold Meyerowitz's son Matthew?

01:22:17.724 --> 01:22:21.811
Yes, and this is Danny,
also Harold Meyerowitz's son.

01:22:21.895 --> 01:22:26.441
I just wanted to say
your father was a huge influence on me.

01:22:26.524 --> 01:22:30.153
He was a great teacher. He found a way
to make everything sound interesting.

01:22:30.236 --> 01:22:31.196
Oh.

01:22:31.279 --> 01:22:35.200
I met my husband, Gary, in his class.

01:22:35.283 --> 01:22:38.244
It was important for us to be here
when we heard he was sick.

01:22:38.328 --> 01:22:41.748
He spoke about you a lot.
He was very proud of you.

01:22:41.831 --> 01:22:44.876
-I didn't realize he had two sons.
-And a daughter.

01:22:44.960 --> 01:22:47.837
-Is that Matt and Danny?
-L.J.!

01:22:47.921 --> 01:22:49.172
Hey.

01:22:49.255 --> 01:22:51.383
I was in Madrid when I heard.

01:22:51.967 --> 01:22:54.886
I am so damn heartbroken
to hear about the old man.

01:22:54.970 --> 01:22:55.971
-Thanks, L.J.
-Yeah.

01:22:56.054 --> 01:22:58.640
How's he doing? Where is he?
I'm coming to visit.

01:22:58.723 --> 01:23:01.101
He's kind of in a coma right now
in Pittsfield.

01:23:01.184 --> 01:23:03.019
I don't give a shit. Let's go tonight.

01:23:03.103 --> 01:23:04.521
And he has sepsis.

01:23:04.604 --> 01:23:06.690
The fucking hospital, it'll kill you.
We got to get him out.

01:23:06.773 --> 01:23:09.526
He'd love if you came,
even if he'll have no idea.

01:23:09.609 --> 01:23:11.695
-We'll take pictures.
-We'll take pictures!

01:23:12.278 --> 01:23:13.530
Where's Loretta?

01:23:13.613 --> 01:23:16.825
Her daughter got chicken pox,
she had to stay in town.

01:23:16.908 --> 01:23:17.909
She was very disappointed.

01:23:17.993 --> 01:23:19.953
-That's too bad.
-I never got chicken pox.

01:23:20.036 --> 01:23:23.123
You should call her, Dan.
I know she'd like to see you.

01:23:23.206 --> 01:23:25.542
-I'm going to.
-And you'd like her boyfriend, too.

01:23:26.292 --> 01:23:28.086
He's a good man, a screenwriter.

01:23:28.169 --> 01:23:30.380
-Congratulations on the show.
-You saw it?

01:23:30.463 --> 01:23:32.924
I should've never left
that opening at MoMA.

01:23:33.008 --> 01:23:35.677
It was just Dad... I felt obligated.

01:23:35.760 --> 01:23:37.178
[Matthew] You thought
you were doing right.

01:23:37.262 --> 01:23:38.471
You would've stayed.

01:23:38.555 --> 01:23:41.099
I probably would've, yeah,
but I would've felt bad about it.

01:23:41.182 --> 01:23:43.560
But it's a good lesson.
Dad can take care of himself.

01:23:43.643 --> 01:23:45.103
You have to take care of yourself.

01:23:45.186 --> 01:23:47.856
No, he can't, Matt.
That's why he's where he is now.

01:23:48.606 --> 01:23:50.608
I should've been able to tell
something was wrong.

01:23:50.692 --> 01:23:52.569
I just thought he was getting old.

01:23:52.652 --> 01:23:54.195
Shit, I yelled at him.

01:23:54.279 --> 01:23:56.990
The guy was suffering
and I screamed at him on the street.

01:23:57.449 --> 01:24:00.952
There's no catharsis in shouting
at an old person who's dying.

01:24:02.579 --> 01:24:05.040
-Do you think he's going to die?
-[Eliza] Hey, Dad!

01:24:05.498 --> 01:24:06.875
I want you to meet someone.

01:24:07.542 --> 01:24:09.461
-This is Robin.
-Nice to meet you.

01:24:09.544 --> 01:24:10.587
-You, too.
-Hey, I'm Matt.

01:24:10.670 --> 01:24:14.299
-Hi. Eliza speaks very highly of you.
-Oh, okay.

01:24:14.382 --> 01:24:16.468
-You speak highly of me?
-You know what he means.

01:24:16.551 --> 01:24:18.136
Eliza, you've had two wines already.

01:24:18.219 --> 01:24:20.221
-Don't have a beer, too.
-I can handle it.

01:24:20.305 --> 01:24:22.766
Eliza, it's not good to mix wine and beer.

01:24:22.849 --> 01:24:24.309
You'll feel cruddy tomorrow,
I'm telling you.

01:24:24.392 --> 01:24:26.061
-I've done it before, Dad.
-Maybe she's right.

01:24:26.144 --> 01:24:29.064
Maybe she has a constitution
that can handle the grape and the grain.

01:24:29.147 --> 01:24:30.648
[Danny] Please, just stay out of it.

01:24:30.732 --> 01:24:32.776
Matt's right. I have the fortitude for it.

01:24:32.859 --> 01:24:35.070
I'm telling you, you'll feel like crap.

01:24:38.573 --> 01:24:40.200
What the fuck, man!

01:24:42.118 --> 01:24:43.870
What does it matter
if she drinks wine and beer?

01:24:43.953 --> 01:24:46.706
Stop interfering with my parenting, Matt!

01:24:46.790 --> 01:24:50.835
She's 18! What parenting do you need
to do here? She's just a person now.

01:24:50.919 --> 01:24:53.838
This is something I do,
and I'm quite good at it, okay?

01:24:54.422 --> 01:24:56.800
She and I have a very good relationship
when you're not around,

01:24:56.883 --> 01:24:59.260
so stop ganging up on me!

01:24:59.928 --> 01:25:00.804
Sorry.

01:25:02.472 --> 01:25:05.892
You know, I've enjoyed
hanging out recently.

01:25:05.975 --> 01:25:07.185
Yeah, me, too.

01:25:08.645 --> 01:25:11.189
You know, I wanted to apologize
for a long time.

01:25:11.272 --> 01:25:12.107
For what?

01:25:12.190 --> 01:25:15.193
I'm pissed at myself because
when Dad kicked me out of the house

01:25:15.276 --> 01:25:17.195
and I moved back in with my mom,

01:25:17.278 --> 01:25:19.989
you really made an effort to hang out,
and I kind of blew you off.

01:25:20.073 --> 01:25:21.658
I feel like I fucked that up.

01:25:22.158 --> 01:25:24.661
I think it's really my fault
we're not close.

01:25:25.078 --> 01:25:26.996
It's hard to be around Dad.

01:25:27.080 --> 01:25:31.376
And your mom at that time, they were both
so critical, and I was just failing.

01:25:31.793 --> 01:25:34.671
-We should go in for our toasts.
-Are you disappointed in me?

01:25:34.754 --> 01:25:36.840
What? No!

01:25:36.923 --> 01:25:40.844
I know Dad is, but I thought maybe
also you were critical of me

01:25:40.927 --> 01:25:43.721
-for quitting piano and...
-No.

01:25:43.805 --> 01:25:45.723
You were my big brother.
I looked up to you.

01:25:45.807 --> 01:25:49.102
-I quit because it was my protest, okay?
-Okay, like McEnroe.

01:25:49.686 --> 01:25:50.937
Also because...

01:25:51.354 --> 01:25:54.899
it was like walking barefoot
through broken glass to get a milkshake.

01:25:56.151 --> 01:25:58.987
I love the milkshake,
but, you know, my feet were bleeding.

01:25:59.070 --> 01:26:01.114
-I can understand that.
-Can you?

01:26:01.781 --> 01:26:04.492
Because my feeling about you is you can't.

01:26:05.118 --> 01:26:06.286
It's not your fault.

01:26:06.953 --> 01:26:11.291
But, like Dad, you make me feel
really bad about myself.

01:26:12.375 --> 01:26:13.376
I'm sorry.

01:26:13.459 --> 01:26:15.295
-I said it's not your fault.
-Let's go.

01:26:17.088 --> 01:26:18.590
-Can I ask you something?
-What?

01:26:19.257 --> 01:26:22.677
A few years ago when Karen and I
had you over to our house

01:26:22.760 --> 01:26:23.845
when you were in town,

01:26:23.928 --> 01:26:25.638
I didn't hear from you afterwards.

01:26:25.722 --> 01:26:28.683
Maybe it was because
Karen and I insulted you in some way

01:26:28.766 --> 01:26:30.852
or Karen maybe had too much grappa?

01:26:30.935 --> 01:26:33.646
No, it was nice.
I went back to L.A. I don't know.

01:26:34.355 --> 01:26:36.941
Were you bored?
Most people find us interesting enough.

01:26:37.025 --> 01:26:39.903
-We've had no complaints.
-It's nothing like that. It's just life.

01:26:39.986 --> 01:26:41.196
It's not more than that.

01:26:41.279 --> 01:26:43.865
Well, even in life,
you can make an effort.

01:26:45.033 --> 01:26:47.368
Write an email on one of your phones.

01:26:47.452 --> 01:26:49.787
-You say you feel guilt but...
-I'm here now!

01:26:49.871 --> 01:26:53.416
I'm in fucking Rhinebeck.
I was just in Pittsfield.

01:26:53.499 --> 01:26:55.210
-I've been here.
-It shouldn't have come to that!

01:26:55.293 --> 01:26:57.462
If Dad survives, you'll go back to L.A.

01:26:57.545 --> 01:27:00.215
and I'll be taking care of him
for a very long time!

01:27:00.298 --> 01:27:02.383
-We'll all help out.
-No, we won't all.

01:27:02.467 --> 01:27:04.844
It'll be me and Jean.

01:27:04.928 --> 01:27:05.887
And mainly me.

01:27:05.970 --> 01:27:09.057
-I'll come more often.
-You made your priorities clear.

01:27:09.140 --> 01:27:12.101
I'm tired of apologizing for doing well!

01:27:12.185 --> 01:27:15.230
Ptolemy always asked me
why you never talked Dad's work up

01:27:15.313 --> 01:27:16.689
to your wealthy clients.

01:27:16.773 --> 01:27:19.108
He says you could be really helpful.

01:27:19.192 --> 01:27:21.277
It's all about perception.

01:27:21.361 --> 01:27:23.154
Now, Dad's a good artist, you know.

01:27:23.821 --> 01:27:26.449
There's no reason
he's not as well-known as L.J.

01:27:26.532 --> 01:27:29.118
Maybe it's not my responsibility
to help Dad, maybe that.

01:27:29.202 --> 01:27:32.497
-No, it's what you do.
-Hey, and also, maybe he's not so great.

01:27:32.580 --> 01:27:35.500
Maybe he's undiscovered for a reason,
maybe that.

01:27:35.583 --> 01:27:38.795
Truth is, we don't know, Danny,
because we were brainwashed.

01:27:38.878 --> 01:27:42.465
Why are you so angry at him anyways?
He loves everything you do.

01:27:42.548 --> 01:27:44.425
Oh, does he? He doesn't tell me that.

01:27:44.509 --> 01:27:45.802
He tells me!

01:27:46.761 --> 01:27:48.596
I should be the one who's angry at him!

01:27:48.680 --> 01:27:53.309
I should hate him... for treating me
and Jean like second-class citizens!

01:27:53.393 --> 01:27:55.895
Then why don't you? You should.

01:27:58.064 --> 01:28:01.025
Listen, you and Jean
are gonna get some money.

01:28:01.609 --> 01:28:03.945
We got a great deal on the house
and all the art,

01:28:04.028 --> 01:28:05.363
and I'm gonna give you both my share.

01:28:05.446 --> 01:28:08.533
It doesn't make up for everything,
but you guys really deserve this.

01:28:08.616 --> 01:28:10.702
Dad said this was a family discussion.

01:28:11.577 --> 01:28:13.955
Wait, did this happen already?

01:28:14.998 --> 01:28:16.082
Yes, it's done.

01:28:16.165 --> 01:28:19.877
No, he told me we'd decide together!

01:28:20.586 --> 01:28:23.256
And you do this
when he can't say anything?

01:28:23.339 --> 01:28:25.800
He told me, Matt! You weren't there!

01:28:25.883 --> 01:28:28.177
If we didn't do something,
we'd be spending the next few years

01:28:28.261 --> 01:28:30.138
throwing his work into dumpsters.

01:28:30.221 --> 01:28:32.056
This way we get something for it.

01:28:32.140 --> 01:28:35.685
I don't care about the money. That house,
that work means something to me!

01:28:35.768 --> 01:28:39.147
You should embrace this.
I should be the one who cares.

01:28:39.230 --> 01:28:41.649
I grew up there, it's my house.
I should care.

01:28:41.733 --> 01:28:43.901
-Then why don't you?
-Because I don't know.

01:28:45.361 --> 01:28:47.655
You're probably right, I should care,
but this makes sense.

01:28:47.739 --> 01:28:49.324
How could you do this to him?

01:28:50.241 --> 01:28:52.368
Who could even dream up such a plan?

01:28:52.452 --> 01:28:54.412
Me! It's what I do for a living.

01:29:00.084 --> 01:29:02.545
Ptolemy says you guys
make yourself indispensable

01:29:02.628 --> 01:29:05.131
-to vulnerable rich people.
-Tell me more about my business.

01:29:05.214 --> 01:29:08.134
I really want to know what you,
or Dad, or fucking Ptolemy thinks

01:29:08.217 --> 01:29:11.095
about what I do every day for a living.

01:29:13.973 --> 01:29:15.641
You kicked me in the shin!

01:29:15.725 --> 01:29:18.394
I was disappointed in you
for quitting piano.

01:29:20.855 --> 01:29:22.690
What the fuck is wrong with you?

01:29:22.774 --> 01:29:25.610
I know it's hard! It's hard for all of us!
Get it together!

01:29:25.693 --> 01:29:28.946
You are doing with Tony
just what Dad did with me and Jean!

01:29:40.416 --> 01:29:42.543
We want to thank Bard for making
this show happen

01:29:42.627 --> 01:29:45.004
and thank many of you for making the trip.

01:29:45.588 --> 01:29:49.592
My dad, and I'm sure every artist involved
in this show, would be really pleased.

01:29:53.554 --> 01:29:58.726
My father was a teacher here for 33 years,
so this is particularly special for him.

01:29:58.810 --> 01:30:04.232
And... this piece is special for me
as it's called "Matthew."

01:30:04.816 --> 01:30:07.527
My father tells a story
of how this piece came to be.

01:30:07.610 --> 01:30:10.154
How I would sit
on the hardwood floor of his studio,

01:30:10.238 --> 01:30:12.240
getting nails in my ass and...

01:30:12.323 --> 01:30:15.159
hand him tools and make suggestions.

01:30:15.243 --> 01:30:18.579
And he would let me help,
or let me think I was helping.

01:30:18.663 --> 01:30:22.416
And when it was done,
he'd said we'd made it together...

01:30:24.252 --> 01:30:26.170
even though I don't remember it.

01:30:26.963 --> 01:30:27.922
But, uh...

01:30:29.382 --> 01:30:30.424
I remember...

01:30:32.677 --> 01:30:36.180
that feeling of being very proud.

01:30:38.224 --> 01:30:39.767
You know, of wanting to...

01:30:43.229 --> 01:30:45.106
be an artist like my dad.

01:30:47.024 --> 01:30:48.693
And that was a good way to feel.

01:30:55.366 --> 01:30:57.285
I'm sorry. I don't know why I'm, uh...

01:31:01.956 --> 01:31:05.293
I've just been angry at him
for so much of my adult life.

01:31:08.713 --> 01:31:10.715
[crying]
I guess I was trying to outrun him...

01:31:13.176 --> 01:31:14.635
but I didn't.

01:31:15.887 --> 01:31:17.889
I'm still his son.

01:31:20.892 --> 01:31:21.893
And...

01:31:23.978 --> 01:31:26.397
I've given away his life's work.

01:31:27.315 --> 01:31:28.441
I'm sorry.

01:31:31.485 --> 01:31:32.486
And if...

01:31:33.905 --> 01:31:37.116
If Dad doesn't make it,
he and I aren't okay.

01:31:37.909 --> 01:31:39.827
We never got to be okay.

01:31:40.912 --> 01:31:44.290
-Danny, do you want to say a few words?
-Yes. Thank you, Matthew.

01:31:46.000 --> 01:31:48.085
No, I was giving it to you.

01:31:49.712 --> 01:31:50.713
Okay.

01:31:53.716 --> 01:31:55.635
[humming]

01:31:55.718 --> 01:31:57.053
[Jean] Why don't you sit here?

01:31:57.136 --> 01:31:58.638
You'll have to bear with me.

01:31:59.180 --> 01:32:03.017
I'm not a good speaker,
and also, I've never done it.

01:32:03.935 --> 01:32:06.938
It's something I've gone
through great pains to avoid.

01:32:07.939 --> 01:32:13.027
When I used to perform music
in front of an audience,

01:32:13.903 --> 01:32:15.363
it was too excruciating.

01:32:15.821 --> 01:32:18.741
The... reward wasn't...

01:32:19.784 --> 01:32:22.119
It just wasn't worth the self-hatred.

01:32:24.288 --> 01:32:28.042
Not to mention,
unlike my brother Matthew...

01:32:29.752 --> 01:32:34.340
I find this particular piece
to be painful,

01:32:34.423 --> 01:32:39.929
because it was during a time
I wasn't really speaking with my dad.

01:32:40.513 --> 01:32:44.558
He had just left my mom, and Jean, and me

01:32:44.642 --> 01:32:46.727
and remarried Matthew's mother,

01:32:47.228 --> 01:32:50.147
whom we really did not like.

01:32:50.690 --> 01:32:52.650
Again, unlike Matt,

01:32:52.733 --> 01:32:58.364
I was not included
in the art-making process.

01:32:58.447 --> 01:33:00.908
It was not mine, too.

01:33:01.742 --> 01:33:05.371
This piece isn't called "Danny."
In fact, there are no Dannys.

01:33:05.454 --> 01:33:06.831
[Jean] Or Jeans.

01:33:06.914 --> 01:33:09.083
[Danny chuckles] Uh...

01:33:10.835 --> 01:33:12.503
Um...

01:33:12.586 --> 01:33:13.421
Yeah.

01:33:13.504 --> 01:33:20.052
Hey, some of you know my father
is in a hospital in Pittsfield right now.

01:33:20.136 --> 01:33:23.848
And we don't know how that's going to go.

01:33:24.682 --> 01:33:27.935
Our doctor's in China,

01:33:28.019 --> 01:33:31.314
-and the only really good nurse we had...
-Excuse me.

01:33:31.939 --> 01:33:33.774
just got reassigned
to a different floor.

01:33:34.859 --> 01:33:35.818
Maybe...

01:33:37.320 --> 01:33:42.366
Maybe I need to believe
my dad was a genius

01:33:42.450 --> 01:33:45.077
because I don't want his life
to be worthless.

01:33:45.161 --> 01:33:50.666
And... if he isn't a great artist,
that means he was just a prick.

01:33:53.127 --> 01:33:55.254
But I think the work's good.

01:33:55.338 --> 01:33:59.925
I think it deserved
more attention than it got.

01:34:00.009 --> 01:34:01.927
I think that's true. Matt?

01:34:04.513 --> 01:34:06.891
I wish he had more success,

01:34:06.974 --> 01:34:09.185
because that would've made
his life easier,

01:34:09.268 --> 01:34:13.022
even if that kind of thing doesn't
ultimately mean much.

01:34:13.105 --> 01:34:14.523
I don't know. L.J.?

01:34:14.607 --> 01:34:16.317
I don't know either.

01:34:17.026 --> 01:34:18.444
If I did, I'd tell you.

01:34:19.820 --> 01:34:24.533
Also, I'm really proud of my daughter,
Eliza, who's a freshman here.

01:34:24.617 --> 01:34:27.828
And really, a talented filmmaker.

01:34:27.912 --> 01:34:28.913
Whoo!

01:34:33.042 --> 01:34:33.876
Thank you...

01:34:54.313 --> 01:34:55.856
How are you feeling?

01:34:55.940 --> 01:34:58.359
Wow, look at this.

01:35:00.653 --> 01:35:03.155
-I love your hair.
-Thanks. Robin cut it.

01:35:03.239 --> 01:35:05.658
-I wish I had the guts to do it.
-Oh, hey, Robin.

01:35:05.741 --> 01:35:08.577
-Do it! Robin will do it right now!
-I've got scissors in my bag.

01:35:09.578 --> 01:35:10.663
Okay.

01:35:11.455 --> 01:35:12.873
How's the hip?

01:35:13.249 --> 01:35:14.917
I'm bionic now.

01:35:15.000 --> 01:35:16.669
That's a reference for Jean only.

01:35:16.752 --> 01:35:18.045
I know what bionic is.

01:35:18.129 --> 01:35:19.463
-I don't.
-It's a show.

01:35:20.172 --> 01:35:21.215
You taught me well.

01:35:22.091 --> 01:35:25.636
[Eliza]  With a head full of dreams
and a backpack filled with candy,

01:35:25.719 --> 01:35:27.721
I set out on my journey.

01:35:28.305 --> 01:35:30.558
Sometimes when you least expect it...

01:35:30.641 --> 01:35:31.809
Are you going my way?

01:35:31.892 --> 01:35:34.478
...you may meet a new friend. Slap!

01:35:35.896 --> 01:35:37.773
Slap! Slap!

01:35:37.857 --> 01:35:39.984
[growls]

01:35:40.067 --> 01:35:41.402
Boing.

01:35:41.485 --> 01:35:44.196
-Jean, that's you with the rabbit.
-You're gonna miss it.

01:35:44.280 --> 01:35:45.531
Kiss. Slap.

01:35:46.073 --> 01:35:49.618
Something changed inside me that day.

01:35:51.036 --> 01:35:52.037
The end?

01:35:52.872 --> 01:35:54.415
Jean, you were so good.

01:35:54.498 --> 01:35:56.959
-She's got real chops.
-I was well-edited.

01:35:57.042 --> 01:35:58.377
That's wonderful, honey.

01:35:58.461 --> 01:36:03.048
I don't know that I've seen
a sex scene shot quite like that before.

01:36:03.132 --> 01:36:05.759
I used deliberately
very harsh, direct light.

01:36:05.843 --> 01:36:07.595
I wanted to appear very unattractive.

01:36:07.678 --> 01:36:09.430
Wonderful mise-en-scène.

01:36:09.513 --> 01:36:12.475
For my  Jeopardy!  parody
I did at my office,

01:36:12.558 --> 01:36:14.768
we just had to use
the overhead fluorescents.

01:36:14.852 --> 01:36:17.438
Yours had wonderful mise-en-scène
as well, Jean.

01:36:17.521 --> 01:36:18.397
Thanks.

01:36:18.481 --> 01:36:20.608
And this is your best yet, Eliza.

01:36:20.691 --> 01:36:23.152
Thanks, Dad.
I've made eight more since then.

01:36:23.235 --> 01:36:24.737
I'm in five of them.

01:36:28.282 --> 01:36:30.117
-[growls]
-[car beeps]

01:36:30.201 --> 01:36:33.120
-[barking]
-Bruno! Bruno! Did you hit traffic?

01:36:33.204 --> 01:36:35.998
-We were expecting you earlier.
-I brought lunch.

01:36:36.081 --> 01:36:38.125
The Dad is being very stubborn.

01:36:38.209 --> 01:36:40.836
I can't get him to do
any of his exercises.

01:36:40.920 --> 01:36:41.754
How's he doing?

01:36:41.837 --> 01:36:45.341
Well, the earliest appointment we can get
with the neurologist is next month.

01:36:45.424 --> 01:36:48.511
It's a lot for me to do by myself here.

01:36:48.594 --> 01:36:51.472
Oh, fortunately, we got
a little more money from the sale.

01:36:51.972 --> 01:36:56.602
James sent photos of one of the sculptures
in the retirement home in Arizona.

01:36:56.685 --> 01:36:58.938
They look quite stunning.

01:36:59.021 --> 01:37:03.734
I have to say, I was very surprised
that you tried to stop the deal

01:37:03.817 --> 01:37:06.403
after all the trouble you went through
setting it up.

01:37:06.487 --> 01:37:07.321
Well...

01:37:07.905 --> 01:37:10.950
I just thought... I changed my mind.

01:37:11.033 --> 01:37:13.577
Well, it was my decision,
as I'm next of kin.

01:37:13.661 --> 01:37:14.912
It's too late now.

01:37:15.412 --> 01:37:18.374
I found these in the Dad's things.
I think they're yours.

01:37:18.457 --> 01:37:19.333
They're Danny's.

01:37:19.416 --> 01:37:22.044
We just have to finish
filling out these insurance forms,

01:37:22.127 --> 01:37:24.588
which seem to be written
in a foreign language.

01:37:25.047 --> 01:37:27.800
Maureen, why don't you ask me?
Somebody in my company will do that.

01:37:27.883 --> 01:37:29.510
Well, I don't like to ask for...

01:37:29.593 --> 01:37:30.844
[whimpers]

01:37:30.928 --> 01:37:31.929
...help.

01:37:34.682 --> 01:37:36.767
-Let me do it, okay?
-But it's a big day.

01:37:36.850 --> 01:37:39.770
It's the Dad's first meal
off of the feeding tube.

01:37:40.145 --> 01:37:43.023
He's very excited that you brought lunch.

01:37:43.107 --> 01:37:44.692
He's watching TCM.

01:37:45.276 --> 01:37:46.193
Hey, Dad.

01:37:48.153 --> 01:37:49.154
Hi.

01:37:49.572 --> 01:37:50.614
What are you watching?

01:37:51.824 --> 01:37:52.825
I don't know.

01:37:55.619 --> 01:37:59.873
In these '30s movies,
the men wore tuxedos all the time.

01:38:01.125 --> 01:38:03.127
Things have gotten much more casual.

01:38:03.794 --> 01:38:07.214
[Matthew] Maybe they dressed up because
they lived shorter lives back then,

01:38:07.298 --> 01:38:08.799
wanted to celebrate life.

01:38:11.844 --> 01:38:14.555
We spent three hours today at Goodwill.

01:38:15.347 --> 01:38:17.391
The Dad had a funny joke.

01:38:17.474 --> 01:38:18.559
What was that?

01:38:19.727 --> 01:38:21.020
Oh.

01:38:21.312 --> 01:38:23.188
I'll set you up again.

01:38:23.272 --> 01:38:26.734
We spent three hours today at Goodwill.

01:38:27.651 --> 01:38:30.029
Which pretty much destroyed mine.

01:38:30.112 --> 01:38:32.406
-Ah. That's good, Dad.
-Thank you.

01:38:33.907 --> 01:38:35.576
You should see the other dog.

01:38:36.118 --> 01:38:38.996
That's true, the Dad got very impatient.

01:38:39.079 --> 01:38:40.956
As we were handing over the boxes,

01:38:41.040 --> 01:38:45.169
I saw that I had accidentally
included my good wok,

01:38:45.252 --> 01:38:47.630
and I hesitated.

01:38:48.589 --> 01:38:49.673
Then I thought,

01:38:50.215 --> 01:38:55.220
"I haven't made Chinese food in ten years.
I'm not gonna make Chinese food again."

01:38:55.304 --> 01:38:58.557
But you have your idea of yourself,

01:38:58.641 --> 01:39:00.434
and you want to hold onto that.

01:39:00.517 --> 01:39:02.603
[coughing]

01:39:02.686 --> 01:39:04.855
-You okay?
-[coughs] Yes.

01:39:04.938 --> 01:39:05.814
Dad, take it easy.

01:39:05.898 --> 01:39:09.193
We just got you out of the hospital,
we don't want you to go back!

01:39:09.276 --> 01:39:10.903
It was very unpleasant in the hospital.

01:39:10.986 --> 01:39:12.112
Mm-hmm.

01:39:12.196 --> 01:39:14.239
You know, I was there
for a couple of months.

01:39:14.323 --> 01:39:16.241
-I know.
-Maureen has been my savior.

01:39:16.325 --> 01:39:18.619
Harold, you're getting brown sauce
all over the sheets.

01:39:18.702 --> 01:39:20.537
No, now you're just rubbing it in.

01:39:20.621 --> 01:39:23.832
Matt, could you help the Dad
get ready for his nap?

01:39:23.916 --> 01:39:24.750
Sure.

01:39:26.210 --> 01:39:27.586
I'm gonna try to visit more.

01:39:28.003 --> 01:39:29.963
It's hard because Tony
starts kindergarten this year,

01:39:30.047 --> 01:39:31.632
and I want to be there for that.

01:39:31.715 --> 01:39:33.884
But I want to be here more.

01:39:33.967 --> 01:39:36.095
L.J.'s coming for lunch
in a couple of weeks.

01:39:36.178 --> 01:39:37.346
You should come for that.

01:39:38.180 --> 01:39:41.392
He left me a very effusive message
about my show,

01:39:41.475 --> 01:39:43.644
and someone wrote a rave on my Google.

01:39:43.727 --> 01:39:46.021
It was very inspired of you
to set that up.

01:39:46.647 --> 01:39:49.608
-Jean and Danny organized it, Dad.
-Is that right?

01:39:49.692 --> 01:39:51.860
-But you made the sale.
-Yeah, that was me.

01:39:51.944 --> 01:39:54.113
I bought a piece back
from Brian and James.

01:39:54.196 --> 01:39:57.074
It's the piece from the show, "Matthew".

01:39:57.825 --> 01:39:59.076
Because "Matthew" and...

01:40:00.619 --> 01:40:01.829
we did it together.

01:40:05.040 --> 01:40:06.500
Thank you for...

01:40:07.710 --> 01:40:09.378
letting me be a part of your process.

01:40:10.754 --> 01:40:12.548
It had a big effect on me, Dad.

01:40:12.631 --> 01:40:14.842
Your confidence was contagious.

01:40:15.551 --> 01:40:18.512
And I think that's why
I'm able to do what I do now.

01:40:20.472 --> 01:40:25.436
I remember I made "Matthew" in 1966,
the year the Whitney bought my piece.

01:40:25.519 --> 01:40:26.895
It couldn't have been 1966.

01:40:26.979 --> 01:40:29.648
It was.
I didn't work in bronze after that.

01:40:29.732 --> 01:40:30.733
I wasn't born yet.

01:40:31.358 --> 01:40:32.443
Well...

01:40:32.985 --> 01:40:34.361
Oh, that's right, isn't it?

01:40:34.945 --> 01:40:36.989
Then it couldn't have been you
watching me, could it?

01:40:37.573 --> 01:40:38.866
Maybe it was your brother.

01:40:41.285 --> 01:40:42.619
You should've called it "Danny."

01:40:43.370 --> 01:40:45.372
You're right, I should have.

01:40:46.540 --> 01:40:48.125
I'm going to go to sleep now.

01:40:53.505 --> 01:40:56.967
It's okay if you want to sit here longer
while I fall asleep.

01:40:57.426 --> 01:40:58.469
Sure.

01:41:13.192 --> 01:41:14.318
I love you, Dad.

01:41:15.569 --> 01:41:16.570
Love you.

01:41:22.576 --> 01:41:23.827
[Danny] Hey, my brother.

01:41:24.828 --> 01:41:27.581
-My brother.
-Thanks for paying for this.

01:41:27.664 --> 01:41:31.126
The private room is... It's not necessary.

01:41:31.210 --> 01:41:32.753
I can get work done this way.

01:41:34.213 --> 01:41:36.590
-How was Dad?
-Oh, I don't know.

01:41:37.716 --> 01:41:38.967
He's still Dad.

01:41:39.051 --> 01:41:41.929
You know, I said goodbye to him
so many times in my head

01:41:42.012 --> 01:41:45.933
that it's strange, in a way,
I wasn't prepared for him to survive.

01:41:46.016 --> 01:41:47.935
Well, now we'll know
what to do the next time.

01:41:48.018 --> 01:41:50.354
The three of us had a real rhythm going.

01:41:50.437 --> 01:41:53.023
I just don't want
to have to speak publicly again.

01:41:55.442 --> 01:41:57.653
You know, sometimes I wish

01:41:57.736 --> 01:42:01.990
Dad had done
one horrible, unforgivable thing,

01:42:02.074 --> 01:42:04.743
something specific
I could be angry about...

01:42:05.661 --> 01:42:07.704
but it isn't one thing,

01:42:07.788 --> 01:42:11.041
it's tiny things every day.

01:42:11.124 --> 01:42:12.835
It's drip, drip, drip.

01:42:12.918 --> 01:42:16.380
I'm sorry I couldn't stop the house
and the art from being sold.

01:42:18.090 --> 01:42:20.467
In the end, Maureen was determined.

01:42:20.551 --> 01:42:21.552
I'm over it.

01:42:21.635 --> 01:42:22.553
I'm not.

01:42:27.057 --> 01:42:28.559
I think these are your Vuarnets.

01:42:28.642 --> 01:42:29.893
I thought those were yours.

01:42:29.977 --> 01:42:31.812
-Maybe they were mine.
-No, I think you're right.

01:42:31.895 --> 01:42:33.230
-They're mine.
-I'm remembering now owning them.

01:42:33.313 --> 01:42:36.108
-No, they look like a pair I had.
-No, you're right.

01:42:36.191 --> 01:42:37.776
-They were mine.
-Give me them.

01:42:38.610 --> 01:42:40.529
Well, you can have them anyway.

01:42:40.612 --> 01:42:41.780
Can you help me walk?

01:42:41.864 --> 01:42:44.950
The nurse is supposed to be here to do it,
but I get antsy.

01:42:45.033 --> 01:42:46.577
Hey, I loved Eliza's new movie.

01:42:46.660 --> 01:42:48.328
It's good, right?

01:42:48.412 --> 01:42:50.998
-You've done a great job with her.
-Thanks.

01:42:51.874 --> 01:42:54.418
You know, I'm glad she likes you so much.

01:42:55.085 --> 01:42:57.963
Hey, when you get out of here,
you want to come to L.A.?

01:42:59.548 --> 01:43:02.801
I love Los Angeles.
I haven't been there, but I love it.

01:43:02.885 --> 01:43:05.012
You could stay with me,
see what you think.

01:43:05.095 --> 01:43:07.014
I don't know. The weather's nice.

01:43:07.556 --> 01:43:09.808
I could get you a ticket
in a couple of weeks.

01:43:09.892 --> 01:43:12.978
I don't know. I think I should stay
and help Maureen with Dad.

01:43:13.061 --> 01:43:15.772
I have sympathy for her,
but I don't trust her.

01:43:15.856 --> 01:43:17.858
Well, if you change your mind...

01:43:19.526 --> 01:43:22.946
I was going to stay here longer,
but I think I should leave tonight

01:43:23.030 --> 01:43:24.239
and get back to Tony.

01:43:24.323 --> 01:43:26.533
Oh, yeah. Go be with your boy.

01:43:28.035 --> 01:43:29.786
Thanks for, you know...

01:43:31.705 --> 01:43:33.165
taking care of me.

01:43:38.879 --> 01:43:42.049
Maureen went into town for groceries
a few hours ago.

01:43:42.132 --> 01:43:44.217
The famous blueberry pancakes.

01:43:45.177 --> 01:43:47.095
I don't know what she could be doing.

01:43:47.179 --> 01:43:48.347
How's her drinking?

01:43:48.430 --> 01:43:49.806
I made her a deal.

01:43:50.599 --> 01:43:53.560
I said we'd put in a pool
if she stopped drinking.

01:43:55.187 --> 01:43:57.981
You know, since the Bard show,

01:43:58.065 --> 01:44:00.484
Matthew has personally invested
in a piece of mine.

01:44:01.109 --> 01:44:02.402
You should have seen Matt, Dad.

01:44:02.486 --> 01:44:05.113
When you were sick,
he was there the whole time.

01:44:05.197 --> 01:44:06.698
He really whipped us into shape.

01:44:06.782 --> 01:44:09.618
I think you and Jean should look
into getting me a solo show.

01:44:09.701 --> 01:44:11.244
That would put me back on the map.

01:44:11.328 --> 01:44:13.163
You know, we were all there
the whole time.

01:44:13.246 --> 01:44:16.750
Every time I turn on TCM,
it's  Meet Me in St. Louis.

01:44:16.833 --> 01:44:18.043
What's on the premium channels?

01:44:18.126 --> 01:44:20.921
It was rough there for a minute.
We thought we might lose you.

01:44:22.255 --> 01:44:26.468
There's something called  Sex Tape
on Starz. You know anything about that?

01:44:26.551 --> 01:44:27.511
Not really.

01:44:28.553 --> 01:44:29.680
Should we try it?

01:44:32.182 --> 01:44:33.934
-[woman]  Hello?
-[girl]  Hi, Mom!

01:44:34.017 --> 01:44:36.144
-Hi, honey.
-Maureen is leaving for Cuba on Monday.

01:44:36.228 --> 01:44:38.480
I thought you could stay with me
while she's away.

01:44:38.563 --> 01:44:41.650
You know, Matt invited me to L.A.

01:44:41.733 --> 01:44:43.777
I'm still recovering.
I could really use the help.

01:44:44.194 --> 01:44:46.947
-Have you ever been to L.A.?
-You're still recovering, too.

01:44:47.030 --> 01:44:50.200
And you know, we've got the premium
channels now. We get the Knicks.

01:44:50.283 --> 01:44:52.869
I know. I lived here
when you were in the hospital.

01:44:53.370 --> 01:44:54.705
You'll have a nurse with you.

01:44:54.788 --> 01:44:58.291
I really need you to stay with me.
I'm asking you to do this, please.

01:44:58.375 --> 01:45:01.128
You know I don't like asking for things.
I need you, Danny.

01:45:03.505 --> 01:45:04.589
Okay.

01:45:05.632 --> 01:45:09.219
I think there's still some of Jean's
cookies in the dining room, take a look.

01:45:15.434 --> 01:45:18.770
I'll take you to lunch next week
at Baba Louie's,

01:45:18.854 --> 01:45:22.441
which is the best pizza in the Berkshires,
maybe the best pizza period.

01:45:22.524 --> 01:45:24.151
Okay, thanks!

01:45:24.234 --> 01:45:25.152
Pick a day.

01:45:25.736 --> 01:45:28.572
Except Saturday,
L.J.'s coming up for lunch,

01:45:28.655 --> 01:45:30.699
so you'll need to find
something else to do,

01:45:30.782 --> 01:45:33.660
but you could go to a movie,
or I think there's bowling.

01:45:35.704 --> 01:45:37.247
-Sorry.
-Danny, what are you doing?

01:45:37.330 --> 01:45:39.374
Sorry, Dad, I didn't think
that would be so loud.

01:45:39.458 --> 01:45:41.918
See if you can rescue some of the cookies
from the porcelain.

01:45:42.502 --> 01:45:45.088
I'm leaving now, Dad.
I'm gonna drive back to the city.

01:45:45.839 --> 01:45:47.174
-You'll be here, right?
-Yeah.

01:45:48.175 --> 01:45:49.760
I'll clean this up, don't worry.

01:45:51.011 --> 01:45:53.055
And then I'm going to L.A. to see Matthew.

01:45:53.805 --> 01:45:54.931
I love you.

01:45:56.016 --> 01:45:57.184
[whispering] I forgive you.

01:45:57.934 --> 01:45:58.852
Forgive me.

01:45:59.394 --> 01:46:02.022
Thank you. Goodbye.

01:46:05.150 --> 01:46:07.819
Flight leaves at 4:30.
You think we'll be okay?

01:46:07.903 --> 01:46:10.447
Yeah, traffic is fine,
and you're flying business class,

01:46:10.530 --> 01:46:12.115
so the check in should be quicker.

01:46:12.574 --> 01:46:14.534
I've never flown business class.

01:46:15.285 --> 01:46:17.079
I've never done business.

01:46:17.162 --> 01:46:18.789
My brother had miles.

01:46:18.872 --> 01:46:20.999
Well, this is a good time
to go to the airport.

01:46:21.083 --> 01:46:22.709
It's coming back that's the problem.

01:46:23.835 --> 01:46:26.379
I'll probably get stuck in that traffic
on the way back.

01:46:27.297 --> 01:46:29.591
-Can you wait for one second?
-Yeah.

01:46:33.220 --> 01:46:34.221
Loretta!

01:46:35.597 --> 01:46:36.723
Loretta!

01:46:37.390 --> 01:46:38.433
Danny!

01:46:38.517 --> 01:46:41.061
Oh, my God, I was just consulting
for someone around the corner

01:46:41.144 --> 01:46:42.145
and went to get a tea.

01:46:42.229 --> 01:46:45.732
-What are you doing in Stuy Town?
-I was going for a ride with my chauffeur.

01:46:45.816 --> 01:46:48.527
No, I'm kidding.
I'm on my way out to the coast.

01:46:48.610 --> 01:46:50.237
-Coast?
-Los Angeles.

01:46:50.320 --> 01:46:51.863
Los Angeles, really?

01:46:51.947 --> 01:46:54.116
Yeah, that's the town car.
Matt got it for me.

01:46:54.199 --> 01:46:55.826
I usually take the A train.

01:46:55.909 --> 01:46:59.663
No, this is not representative
of where I am in my life.

01:47:00.413 --> 01:47:02.707
Yeah, I'm going to stay with him
for a while.

01:47:02.791 --> 01:47:04.709
Oh, that's nice. What's this cane?

01:47:04.793 --> 01:47:07.337
Oh, this is an affectation I'm trying.

01:47:07.420 --> 01:47:09.047
No, new hip.

01:47:09.548 --> 01:47:11.508
Oh, wow! Dan, are you okay?

01:47:11.591 --> 01:47:13.009
Yeah, better.

01:47:13.093 --> 01:47:16.388
I tried my best to ignore it,
but the hip won out.

01:47:16.471 --> 01:47:17.514
Well...

01:47:17.597 --> 01:47:19.015
Oh, my God! How's your dad?

01:47:19.850 --> 01:47:22.310
He's okay. He's out of the hospital.

01:47:22.394 --> 01:47:24.271
Oh, that's great. My dad was worried.

01:47:24.354 --> 01:47:27.315
Yeah, he's better health-wise.
Otherwise, he's the same.

01:47:27.399 --> 01:47:29.317
Sometimes they're just the same,
aren't they?

01:47:29.401 --> 01:47:31.736
Yeah, he's still waiting
for his life to begin.

01:47:31.820 --> 01:47:34.281
Oh, no, but he's done so well,
don't you think?

01:47:34.364 --> 01:47:36.324
-I don't know, has he?
-He has.

01:47:36.408 --> 01:47:40.370
He taught all those years at Bard.
I used to love to hear him talk about art.

01:47:40.453 --> 01:47:44.583
He did good work. His kids are great.
It's a shame he can't feel that way.

01:47:45.750 --> 01:47:48.879
L.J. mentioned you were seeing
a screenwriter?

01:47:48.962 --> 01:47:50.547
Oh, yeah, that didn't take.

01:47:50.630 --> 01:47:53.675
You know, after my divorce,
I don't know what I'm doing.

01:47:53.758 --> 01:47:56.928
I won't be leaving New York for good.
I'll be back.

01:47:57.012 --> 01:47:59.723
That's what everyone says who goes
to L.A., then it's 20 years later.

01:47:59.806 --> 01:48:01.975
-I'll see you in 20 years.
-Okay, bye.

01:48:02.058 --> 01:48:03.685
No, I have to come back

01:48:03.768 --> 01:48:06.730
for Eliza's Freshmen Film Festival
anyways in a month.

01:48:06.813 --> 01:48:08.815
-Can I come?
-Yeah.

01:48:09.983 --> 01:48:11.026
It's at Bard.

01:48:11.109 --> 01:48:12.235
I'd love to come.

01:48:12.903 --> 01:48:15.780
It's not un-pornographic, I'm warning you.

01:48:15.864 --> 01:48:19.576
-I'm in the art world, I've seen it all.
-She's really talented, I think.

01:48:19.659 --> 01:48:21.828
You know, I think she's got something.

01:48:21.912 --> 01:48:24.289
I'm sure she does. It's a talented family.

01:48:24.372 --> 01:48:26.541
-I'm telling you.
-[chuckles]

01:48:26.791 --> 01:48:29.377
Well, something to look forward to,
isn't it?

01:49:04.037 --> 01:49:05.038
Here it is.

01:49:17.801 --> 01:49:18.760
This is him.

01:49:21.304 --> 01:49:22.389
[Robin] That's so cool.
