WEBVTT

00:02.170 --> 00:04.638
ANNOUNCER:
An FX original series.

00:04.672 --> 00:06.174
Mr. InBetween.

00:07.275 --> 00:10.744
All new,
Thursdays at 10:00 on FX.

00:12.012 --> 00:13.147
(motors revving)

00:13.181 --> 00:16.784
ANNOUNCER: FX presents Mayans.

00:19.120 --> 00:20.054
- Previously
on "Mayans M.C."...

00:20.088 --> 00:21.389
- There's a reason

00:21.422 --> 00:23.424
your life is on the other side
of the fence.

00:23.457 --> 00:26.060
Every time
you cross that border,

00:26.094 --> 00:29.097
your wife loses
a little piece of you.

00:29.130 --> 00:33.067
- I never did a paternity
or DNA test on Miguel.

00:33.101 --> 00:35.069
I knew he was your son.

00:35.103 --> 00:36.370
- Does anyone else know?

00:36.404 --> 00:38.406
- No, of course not,

00:38.439 --> 00:40.374
and no one ever will.

00:40.408 --> 00:42.610
- I don't get it.
What the fuck's this mean?

00:42.643 --> 00:45.913
- Isabel Varela,
Ignacio Cortina--

00:45.946 --> 00:47.348
those are their real names.

00:47.381 --> 00:50.918
I saw pictures of Pop
with Jose Galindo.

00:50.951 --> 00:52.353
- SeÃ±orita Palomo could create

00:52.386 --> 00:55.022
a most unsettling wave
of democracy.

00:55.055 --> 00:58.192
- We think Adelita might have
used her prenatal downtime

00:58.226 --> 01:00.394
to create new relationships.

01:00.428 --> 01:01.462
- I know you have your reasons

01:01.495 --> 01:03.030
for keeping things
on the down-low,

01:03.063 --> 01:05.933
but I'd at least like to tell
my family I'm having a kid.

01:05.966 --> 01:09.803
- Let's wait until she's born
and we're all safe.

01:12.773 --> 01:14.608
- No, Adelita!

01:19.247 --> 01:21.115
- Queen bee's inside,
gentlemen.

01:25.085 --> 01:27.321
- Come on.

02:19.707 --> 02:21.809
- This is what we have.
Looks good.

02:21.842 --> 02:22.943
- Okay.

02:22.976 --> 02:24.645
- Yeah.

02:30.818 --> 02:32.220
- Major.

02:33.487 --> 02:36.156
- Mr. Potter, Agent Linares.

02:37.525 --> 02:38.859
Sitrep.

02:38.892 --> 02:40.394
Oh, yesterday's roundup.

02:47.668 --> 02:51.739
- You put her
in a fucking dog cage?

02:51.772 --> 02:53.407
- We didn't have a cell.

02:53.441 --> 02:55.543
- Jesus Christ.

02:56.544 --> 02:59.146
- She's pregnant, troglodyte.

03:12.360 --> 03:14.762
- Agent Collins,
get her vitals.

03:14.795 --> 03:16.830
Make sure the baby's okay.
- Yeah.

03:16.864 --> 03:18.566
- I'm fine.

03:18.599 --> 03:19.700
So is she.

03:38.886 --> 03:40.288
Bathroom.

03:56.570 --> 03:58.306
- Don't you find it odd

03:58.339 --> 04:01.241
that our Ivy League prince
took it upon himself

04:01.275 --> 04:05.012
to track and snare
the deadly rebel queen?

04:05.913 --> 04:09.049
- A little out of character,
I guess, but we got her.

04:09.082 --> 04:10.918
Cleared the board.

04:10.951 --> 04:12.986
- Yes.

04:13.020 --> 04:16.990
We declawed the rebels, and,
uh, handed Galindo the reins

04:17.024 --> 04:20.227
to Sonora and eastern Baja.

04:20.260 --> 04:21.495
- And we control those reins.

04:21.529 --> 04:25.966
- Yet with all that control...

04:25.999 --> 04:28.402
the rabble still rises.

04:28.436 --> 04:31.472
Strikes, riots,
civil empowerment.

04:33.173 --> 04:35.175
And with
the inevitable tariffs,

04:35.208 --> 04:38.746
I fear the left
will use the chaos

04:38.779 --> 04:42.950
as a fast lane
to el Palacio Nacional.

04:43.651 --> 04:45.586
- Mr. Potter,
we found a clearing

04:45.619 --> 04:46.820
less than a klick away.

04:46.854 --> 04:48.789
We can easily land
a bird there.

04:48.822 --> 04:51.459
- Flying a Black Hawk
in the middle of a goat village

04:51.492 --> 04:53.961
might undermine our need
for diplomatic discretion.

04:56.129 --> 04:59.299
- We will transport our asset
tomorrow morning.

05:00.701 --> 05:03.571
We'll need a few
strategic scenarios.

05:04.805 --> 05:06.206
- "A few"?

05:06.239 --> 05:08.842
- I want options, Major.

05:08.876 --> 05:11.278
We must assume
behind every local face

05:11.311 --> 05:13.781
hides a potential spy.

05:13.814 --> 05:17.351
And if we're being watched
or deceived...

05:17.385 --> 05:18.786
we'll have to decide

05:18.819 --> 05:22.322
which shell
to put the pea under.

05:24.658 --> 05:28.829
- Well, I have six men here,
another four on the way.

05:28.862 --> 05:30.664
Is that enough
for your shell game?

05:31.599 --> 05:34.368
- We'll make sure
you have enough.

05:34.402 --> 05:36.504
Excuse us.

05:37.838 --> 05:40.240
I'll need you
to reach out to Galindo.

05:40.273 --> 05:42.810
I might need his help.

06:02.796 --> 06:05.899
- You don't care about me
or my child.

06:05.933 --> 06:07.868
Answer the question.

06:13.474 --> 06:16.844
- We're taking you
to a federal holding facility.

06:16.877 --> 06:18.512
We'll keep you healthy
and comfortable

06:18.546 --> 06:19.847
until the birth.

06:19.880 --> 06:22.683
Then...

06:22.716 --> 06:25.052
we'll want to know
all the things you know.

06:27.087 --> 06:29.523
We'll torture you.

06:29.557 --> 06:31.759
But that probably won't work,

06:31.792 --> 06:35.062
so we'll use your child
as leverage.

06:38.632 --> 06:41.234
I, uh, have a theory--

06:41.268 --> 06:43.771
a blasphemous one.

06:43.804 --> 06:47.207
I don't believe King Solomon
was a wise man at all.

06:47.240 --> 06:49.109
I think he was
a malevolent sadist

06:49.142 --> 06:51.111
who just got lucky.

06:54.314 --> 06:57.585
A mother's love
knows no boundaries...

07:02.923 --> 07:06.960
Nor can it hide
the truth that holds it.

07:45.465 --> 07:47.000
- When did you get back?

07:49.703 --> 07:52.840
- Just now.

07:58.579 --> 07:59.980
- Miguel.

08:02.482 --> 08:04.552
Miguel, what happened?

08:11.424 --> 08:13.694
We were, um...

08:13.727 --> 08:17.531
taking Adelita
to meet one of her benefactors.

08:18.732 --> 08:22.469
Potter's mercs tracked us.

08:22.502 --> 08:25.305
We were trapped,
a village outside of Tecate.

08:25.338 --> 08:27.808
- Jesus.

08:27.841 --> 08:29.409
- When we realized
they were there,

08:29.442 --> 08:32.479
Adelita grabbed a gun
and ran from us.

08:32.512 --> 08:34.582
Made it look like
Alvarez and I were there

08:34.615 --> 08:37.818
to hunt her down.

08:37.851 --> 08:41.188
We told the mercs we got a tip
from the locals.

08:47.595 --> 08:50.731
She sacrificed herself,

08:50.764 --> 08:52.700
and I just let her do it.

08:54.702 --> 08:58.338
- She did it
to protect everything, baby.

08:58.371 --> 09:00.608
It was her choice.
- I know.

09:00.641 --> 09:03.510
I just feel so fucking...

09:03.543 --> 09:05.545
powerless and...

09:07.247 --> 09:10.083
We've seen what Potter can do.

09:10.117 --> 09:13.721
His head games and...

09:13.754 --> 09:15.923
emotional torture.

09:15.956 --> 09:17.891
He--he's gonna fuck her up.

09:20.493 --> 09:21.929
The baby...

09:26.634 --> 09:28.802
I should have helped her.

09:28.836 --> 09:31.772
How did I let this happen?

09:43.684 --> 09:46.820
The way you talk about her...

09:49.623 --> 09:52.325
It's obvious
there's a connection.

09:53.827 --> 09:55.763
Is it more than that?

09:58.031 --> 09:59.299
Do you love her?

09:59.332 --> 10:01.134
- Wait, what?

10:01.168 --> 10:04.104
No, no, no.

10:04.137 --> 10:05.338
God, no.

10:05.372 --> 10:07.507
Em, no, it--it's nothing
like that, all right?

10:07.540 --> 10:09.109
There--there is no...

10:12.545 --> 10:16.984
Look, I went
from hating Adelita...

10:17.017 --> 10:18.952
to...

10:18.986 --> 10:23.123
understanding her and, um...

10:23.156 --> 10:26.193
eventually...

10:26.226 --> 10:27.961
respecting her,

10:27.995 --> 10:30.363
I mean, the things she did.

10:31.799 --> 10:34.501
And for these past
few months, uh...

10:34.534 --> 10:37.671
watching her
singular devotion--

10:37.705 --> 10:42.009
I mean, this selfless need
to help her people--

10:42.042 --> 10:45.012
I mean, it's potent and...

10:46.880 --> 10:48.816
It's beautiful.

10:51.852 --> 10:53.653
I grew envious.

10:56.256 --> 10:58.658
I wanted some of that.

10:59.359 --> 11:00.861
- Mm-hmm.

11:05.365 --> 11:08.168
- You're right.

11:08.201 --> 11:10.237
Hmm.

11:10.270 --> 11:12.505
I've gone out of my way
to be around Adelita,

11:12.539 --> 11:15.408
but it wasn't about her.

11:15.442 --> 11:17.410
It was about me.

11:19.012 --> 11:22.716
- You know, the things you did
in the other world...

11:25.719 --> 11:29.656
The conflict
that spun inside of you...

11:29.689 --> 11:33.393
I was always
your touchstone, Miguel.

11:34.194 --> 11:37.765
You know, our family,
our lives, your business--

11:37.798 --> 11:38.932
everything on this side
of the border

11:38.966 --> 11:41.068
was honest and real.

11:45.072 --> 11:47.808
That's the thing
you wanted to be around.

11:50.310 --> 11:52.145
That's what you thought
was beautiful.

11:52.980 --> 11:55.415
- Oh, I still do, mi amor.

11:57.284 --> 12:00.788
Look, I know
I've been distracted.

12:00.821 --> 12:03.423
It's all...

12:03.456 --> 12:05.692
Look, everything's
changed, all right?

12:05.725 --> 12:08.361
This play with Potter, it--

12:08.395 --> 12:10.864
it has so many moving pieces.

12:10.898 --> 12:13.233
I can barely know what--
- You know what?

12:13.266 --> 12:16.904
You can lie to me, Miguel,
but don't lie to yourself.

12:16.937 --> 12:20.640
Look, up till now, the DOJ con
has been nothing but a win.

12:20.673 --> 12:22.709
Your drug trade
has nearly doubled.

12:22.742 --> 12:24.311
More power, more territories.

12:24.344 --> 12:28.748
I have watched you
ride that success.

12:28.782 --> 12:31.819
You haven't struggled
with it, baby.

12:31.852 --> 12:33.821
You've embraced it.

12:51.138 --> 12:52.339
- I'm sorry.

12:54.942 --> 12:56.409
I guess I just didn't see it.

12:56.443 --> 12:58.611
I...

12:58.645 --> 13:01.581
didn't realize
I was that far away.

13:01.614 --> 13:03.283
- I know.

13:04.351 --> 13:06.786
- I'm sorry to interrupt, but--
- Hey.

13:06.820 --> 13:09.756
Please, Marcus, not right now.

13:09.789 --> 13:12.225
- It's Potter.

13:14.627 --> 13:16.830
- Take it.

13:16.864 --> 13:18.966
Let me know
if you need anything.

13:20.834 --> 13:22.469
- Em...

13:32.212 --> 13:34.781
Yeah.

13:58.405 --> 13:59.907
- Jefe.

14:03.510 --> 14:05.145
What's up?

14:05.178 --> 14:08.148
- Swole Boys.
- Yeah, uh--

14:08.181 --> 14:09.917
- We ran into them
on the way up to Stockton.

14:09.950 --> 14:12.052
- So did we...on the way back.

14:12.085 --> 14:14.754
- A fist-fuck of a snafu.

14:14.787 --> 14:16.056
Riz went down.

14:17.190 --> 14:18.258
- Sorry, I never thought
they would be--

14:18.291 --> 14:21.028
- That's always
my worry, Angel.

14:21.061 --> 14:23.696
You never think
beyond the action.

14:23.730 --> 14:25.665
- The shit with Medina
kind of pulled focus, man.

14:25.698 --> 14:26.766
It ain't his fault.

14:26.799 --> 14:29.169
- Hey, shut the fuck up,
prospect.

14:29.202 --> 14:30.837
You're right, Prez.

14:30.870 --> 14:33.206
I fucked up, man.

14:33.240 --> 14:36.276
You know, he ain't know
any better, but I did.

14:36.309 --> 14:38.845
Let the table decide.
I'll take the hit.

14:38.878 --> 14:40.780
Stand down till then.

14:42.315 --> 14:45.285
- Bishop!
Alvarez on the burner.

14:50.223 --> 14:51.858
- What the fuck
are you doing?

14:51.891 --> 14:53.793
You want your jaw
cracked again?

14:53.826 --> 14:55.262
- Sorry, I just...

14:57.897 --> 15:00.067
- Prez hit you up?
- Yeah.

15:00.100 --> 15:01.701
Who knew the Swole Boys
would be stupid enough

15:01.734 --> 15:03.236
to go after the fucking M.C.?

15:03.270 --> 15:04.271
- We did.

15:06.073 --> 15:08.608
- Fuck, mercs got Adelita.

15:08.641 --> 15:11.211
Gotta meet Alvarez and Galindo
at the warehouse.

15:25.292 --> 15:27.894
- Angel.
Hey, talk to me.

15:27.927 --> 15:29.963
What are you doing?

15:29.997 --> 15:31.631
You can't do that here.

15:54.121 --> 15:56.089
- Come on, Chucky.

16:07.334 --> 16:10.270
- * Mother of exiles

16:10.303 --> 16:12.439
* The torch of hope

16:12.472 --> 16:15.208
* In the toss of the tempest

16:15.242 --> 16:18.111
* Threw us Madison's rope

16:18.145 --> 16:20.380
* But the brazen giant

16:20.413 --> 16:23.283
* With limbs astride

16:23.316 --> 16:26.353
* Blocks the golden door

16:26.386 --> 16:30.123
* To the U.S. of Lies

16:30.157 --> 16:34.294
* Damn your huddled masses

16:34.327 --> 16:37.164
* Scrub our floors

16:37.197 --> 16:39.632
* Cut our grasses

16:39.666 --> 16:42.635
* I am a wolf

16:42.669 --> 16:45.172
* A wild cur

16:45.205 --> 16:48.741
* Cut from the pack

16:48.775 --> 16:51.211
* With blood on my fur

16:51.244 --> 16:54.147
* Every howl

16:54.181 --> 16:56.816
* Marks the debt

16:56.849 --> 17:01.754
* 'Cause a beaten dog

17:01.788 --> 17:05.158
* Never forgets

17:05.192 --> 17:07.827
* Every howl

17:07.860 --> 17:10.763
* Marks the debt

17:10.797 --> 17:15.435
* 'Cause a beaten dog

17:15.468 --> 17:18.205
* Never forgets

17:21.074 --> 17:24.611
* Never forgets

17:42.329 --> 17:44.764
- I'm glad you're here, primo.

17:44.797 --> 17:46.599
Taza.

17:50.137 --> 17:52.639
- Thank you for coming.
- Of course.

17:56.276 --> 17:58.378
- They're up to speed.

17:58.411 --> 18:01.080
- Good, we should go.
Can talk on the way.

18:16.263 --> 18:18.998
- Why would Potter ask you
to help transport Adelita?

18:19.031 --> 18:21.134
Hobart's got an army.

18:21.168 --> 18:22.902
- I don't think
he wants my help.

18:22.935 --> 18:24.504
I think it's a test.

18:24.537 --> 18:27.073
- See if we can be trusted.

18:27.106 --> 18:28.741
- He's setting you up?

18:28.775 --> 18:30.777
- Look, if I'm Potter,

18:30.810 --> 18:32.979
I'm starting to see
too many anomalies.

18:33.012 --> 18:34.447
All the damage he's done
to the L.O.,

18:34.481 --> 18:36.949
and yet rebellion
is on the rise.

18:36.983 --> 18:38.418
Right, strikes, protests--

18:38.451 --> 18:40.353
- Killing the mercs
to save Mini...

18:40.387 --> 18:42.088
he read that as a rebel reboot.

18:42.121 --> 18:43.823
- And yesterday's close call.

18:43.856 --> 18:46.193
Maybe you being there
was a little convenient.

18:46.226 --> 18:47.760
- Yes.

18:47.794 --> 18:51.431
Look, we've played this smart
right under Potter's nose,

18:51.464 --> 18:54.701
but now
he's not quite sure what.

18:54.734 --> 18:57.737
He just knows there's
something he doesn't know.

19:02.642 --> 19:05.812
- Friends in high places.

19:05.845 --> 19:07.380
- SeÃ±orita Palomo.

19:27.500 --> 19:30.002
- You know Mr. Alvarez.
- Yeah.

19:30.036 --> 19:32.405
And our associates
from Santo Padre.

19:32.439 --> 19:36.476
- I'm Bishop.
This is Taza, Hank.

19:36.509 --> 19:38.711
- Bishop.
- Pleasure.

19:38.745 --> 19:40.247
- Taza.

19:40.280 --> 19:41.814
Navajo?

19:41.848 --> 19:45.084
- Mostly Apache, Comanche,
little Sephardic Jew.

19:46.353 --> 19:47.754
That's a long lineage
of holocausts.

19:47.787 --> 19:49.356
- Amen, sister.

19:50.690 --> 19:53.025
- At our table,
we call you the saint.

19:53.059 --> 19:54.994
- I'm not the saint,
gentlemen.

19:55.027 --> 19:56.663
Adelita is.

19:56.696 --> 19:58.565
Let's find a way
to bring her home.

20:12.545 --> 20:14.381
- Sorry for losing my shit.

20:16.983 --> 20:18.551
- Is it Adelita?

20:20.987 --> 20:23.456
I know you had a thing for her,

20:23.490 --> 20:24.591
but you really haven't
said much about it

20:24.624 --> 20:26.759
since she locked down Galindo.

20:26.793 --> 20:28.395
- I haven't said much
of anything to you

20:28.428 --> 20:29.962
since we locked down Galindo.

20:31.664 --> 20:32.732
Good point.

20:38.605 --> 20:39.772
You can now.

20:41.341 --> 20:43.242
Say shit.

20:43.276 --> 20:44.911
I'm here.

20:47.246 --> 20:48.881
- The man I thought
was Felipe Reyes

20:48.915 --> 20:50.617
is waiting for a beer.

20:51.651 --> 20:54.454
What should we say to him?

21:00.259 --> 21:02.595
- Nothing yet.

21:02.629 --> 21:05.832
We need to get all the intel
from Happy.

21:05.865 --> 21:07.334
Then we'll figure it out.

21:09.035 --> 21:10.437
- Yeah.

21:13.105 --> 21:14.674
Can't wait.

21:31.290 --> 21:33.159
- Thank you.

21:53.012 --> 21:54.414
You all right, mi'jo?

21:57.049 --> 21:58.918
- I'm okay, Pop.

22:07.193 --> 22:10.296
- I'm sorry...

22:10.329 --> 22:11.898
for shutting you out.

22:16.403 --> 22:19.672
I'm the one who's sorry, son.

22:21.007 --> 22:24.010
I should have
done more for you.

22:24.043 --> 22:25.745
Paid attention.

22:31.618 --> 22:33.185
- I was so pissed off, Pop,

22:33.219 --> 22:35.422
it wouldn't have mattered.

22:35.455 --> 22:38.525
Everything you and Mom
tried to do...

22:38.558 --> 22:40.593
it was just something
for me to hate.

22:45.097 --> 22:47.033
- Well...

22:47.066 --> 22:50.069
I guess we're all
a little fucked up.

22:58.310 --> 22:59.879
- Sorry to bother you.

22:59.912 --> 23:01.080
Taza called.

23:01.113 --> 23:02.114
Bishops wants everyone

23:02.148 --> 23:04.684
at the dress warehouse ASAP.

23:04.717 --> 23:06.118
- He say why?

23:06.152 --> 23:08.721
- I'm very rarely privy
to the "why."

23:08.755 --> 23:11.190
I'm quite content
to be part of the "what."

23:11.223 --> 23:13.059
- Thanks, Chucky.

23:16.228 --> 23:19.866
- I'm very relieved
to see your familial ties

23:19.899 --> 23:22.902
are once again tightly bound.

23:24.403 --> 23:27.273
I hope to know that someday.

23:35.782 --> 23:37.884
- He's an odd little guy.

24:00.540 --> 24:02.408
- Ring the buzzer
when you're finished.

24:02.441 --> 24:03.976
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

24:29.335 --> 24:31.938
- Right here.

24:44.016 --> 24:45.685
- It's confirmed.

24:45.718 --> 24:48.220
Our Mexicali contact
in the PolicÃ­a Estatal,

24:48.254 --> 24:51.023
his whole unit's been put
on standby--48 hours.

24:51.057 --> 24:53.192
That only happens
for natural disasters

24:53.225 --> 24:56.028
or diplomatic security.

24:56.062 --> 24:57.463
- And our girl
at the U.S. border

24:57.496 --> 24:58.965
confirms the U.S. side.

24:58.998 --> 25:01.968
Her unit's been pulled
off patrol units for two days.

25:02.001 --> 25:04.336
Some shit about
"assessing border integrity."

25:04.370 --> 25:05.638
- Potter cleared
both sides of the wall

25:05.672 --> 25:07.540
to open up a fucking hole.

25:07.574 --> 25:09.709
- No camera, guards,
or records.

25:11.210 --> 25:13.145
- Her unit covers
the Alamo River

25:13.179 --> 25:14.513
from the Verde Drain,

25:14.547 --> 25:17.550
which means the feds
should cut a hole somewhere...

25:17.584 --> 25:20.052
in here.

25:20.086 --> 25:21.821
- If Alvarez meets
the bullshit transport

25:21.854 --> 25:24.256
at this exit...
heading west,

25:24.290 --> 25:26.893
safe house gotta be somewhere
between TJ highway

25:26.926 --> 25:28.661
and the hole in the wall.

25:28.695 --> 25:31.664
- It's mostly desert,
barren land.

25:31.698 --> 25:33.733
Only a few small towns.

25:34.734 --> 25:37.269
- Palomo came through.

25:37.303 --> 25:39.606
- We had her use some sway
to check local records,

25:39.639 --> 25:42.842
realty databases, see if any
outside parties recently bought

25:42.875 --> 25:45.211
or rented with cash,
paid in advance.

25:45.244 --> 25:47.246
- The last month,
there was three cash buys

25:47.279 --> 25:49.248
from outside the state.

25:49.281 --> 25:52.184
30 acres of farmland
along this canal right here,

25:52.218 --> 25:55.254
a warehouse near the quarry
right here,

25:55.287 --> 25:58.257
and a two-story unit
in the hillside village.

25:58.290 --> 25:59.692
- It's not the farmland.

25:59.726 --> 26:01.928
- I can have my people there
in less than an hour.

26:01.961 --> 26:04.697
Check the quarry, the village,
find out where they have her.

26:04.731 --> 26:06.699
- We need to move
while it's still dark.

26:06.733 --> 26:08.400
- We'll put our piece together
and head out.

26:08.434 --> 26:10.136
We'll coordinate
once we're in place.

26:10.169 --> 26:11.804
- I'll do whatever I can
on this side.

26:11.838 --> 26:15.241
- When this goes down,
you need to be seen in town.

26:15.274 --> 26:17.209
Just another day.

26:17.243 --> 26:18.745
- I know.

26:18.778 --> 26:20.379
There are cars waiting
outside the tunnel--

26:20.412 --> 26:21.981
clean, with plates.

26:22.014 --> 26:23.716
Everything else you need
should be here.

26:23.750 --> 26:25.652
If it's not, I'll get it.

27:12.699 --> 27:14.600
- When we get the intel
from Pablo,

27:14.633 --> 27:16.535
we'll set up
observation points.

27:16.568 --> 27:19.105
Can't miss anything,
coming or going.

27:19.138 --> 27:21.307
- We'll put the prospect
on one of those.

27:21.340 --> 27:22.709
- Whatever you need.

27:26.746 --> 27:28.347
- How's the leg?

27:28.380 --> 27:30.717
- You know, sore.

27:30.750 --> 27:33.552
In a good way.
- All right, you're in.

27:33.585 --> 27:36.555
Angel, you set up
in the Ariza tunnel.

27:36.588 --> 27:39.025
We need someone on comms.
- What?

27:39.058 --> 27:40.793
No, fuck that.
I gotta be on this.

27:40.827 --> 27:42.729
- You know how this works.

27:42.762 --> 27:44.363
Until we table
what happened in Berdoo,

27:44.396 --> 27:45.631
you take a step back.

27:45.664 --> 27:47.633
- No, man, that can't happen.

27:47.666 --> 27:48.835
Not now.

27:48.868 --> 27:52.371
- Yeah, it can,
and it just fucking did.

27:58.845 --> 27:59.979
- Man, fuck you.

28:00.012 --> 28:01.647
You can't stop me
from doing this.

28:01.680 --> 28:03.149
I'm going to Mexico
to find her.

28:03.182 --> 28:06.152
If you wanna fucking stop me,
rey de los mayas,

28:06.185 --> 28:08.287
you're gonna have to fucking
put a bullet in my back.

28:16.295 --> 28:20.833
- Whatever problem you have
with me, we settle it now,

28:20.867 --> 28:22.769
'cause if you ever
call me out again,

28:22.802 --> 28:24.103
shit on the respect
I've earned,

28:24.136 --> 28:26.005
I'm gonna cut you into pieces,

28:26.038 --> 28:28.674
bury you in a fucking hole,
and piss in it.

28:41.553 --> 28:43.455
- Fuck you.

28:43.489 --> 28:45.391
It's my kid!

28:45.424 --> 28:49.228
Adelita--it's my fucking kid!

28:49.261 --> 28:50.763
It's my kid.

28:51.998 --> 28:54.767
- Jesus Christ.

29:07.780 --> 29:09.816
I'm sorry.

29:09.849 --> 29:11.550
We connected that day
at casino.

29:11.583 --> 29:13.652
I started doing
the relief runs with her.

29:13.685 --> 29:16.655
It just happened, man.

29:16.688 --> 29:17.890
We didn't want
to step on business,

29:17.924 --> 29:19.959
so we kept it quiet.

29:19.992 --> 29:21.961
- Anyone else know
it's your kid?

29:21.994 --> 29:25.898
- No, no, she wouldn't
let me tell anyone.

29:25.932 --> 29:27.399
You don't want
to argue with her.

29:27.433 --> 29:28.500
- Hmm.

29:31.770 --> 29:33.572
Shithead.

29:37.176 --> 29:38.277
Come here.

29:41.814 --> 29:43.782
All right.

29:43.816 --> 29:46.218
We stay in touch
on the sat phones.

29:48.220 --> 29:49.155
Let's move.

30:12.744 --> 30:14.613
- Any other vehicles
coming or going?

30:14.646 --> 30:16.448
- No, just those three.

30:16.482 --> 30:17.449
- You get a head count?

30:17.483 --> 30:19.151
- So far, we've seen
three teams

30:19.185 --> 30:20.719
bringing in supplies.

30:20.752 --> 30:22.121
Definitely mercs.

30:22.154 --> 30:25.391
Probably got a full unit
protecting her.

30:25.424 --> 30:26.525
- Good work, brother.

30:26.558 --> 30:28.627
Collect your people.
Stay out of sight.

30:28.660 --> 30:31.497
And the homeowner,
pay him off.

30:34.400 --> 30:35.902
- Gracias.
- De nada.

30:41.273 --> 30:43.809
- Yeah?

30:43.842 --> 30:45.878
Taza.

30:50.516 --> 30:51.850
- You set?

30:53.252 --> 30:56.355
- Yeah, there's only one way
up to the garage--

30:56.388 --> 30:57.924
side stairwell.

30:57.957 --> 30:59.525
Got a clear sight line.
- Good.

31:02.094 --> 31:04.230
- Alvarez know?
- Yeah.

31:04.263 --> 31:05.764
He's keeping Galindo
in the loop.

31:12.905 --> 31:14.206
- I'm here.

31:17.876 --> 31:19.745
- We confirmed the safe house.

31:19.778 --> 31:22.614
That's good news.

31:22.648 --> 31:24.416
- Do your thing today.

31:24.450 --> 31:26.685
I'll hit you up
when I know more.

31:26.718 --> 31:28.220
- Thank you.

31:29.888 --> 31:31.357
- We're clear
on our side, yeah.

31:31.390 --> 31:32.959
Cartel confirm?
- Confirmed.

31:32.992 --> 31:34.293
Okay, hold on.

31:34.326 --> 31:36.295
Hobart's ready.
Alvarez is in place.

31:38.297 --> 31:41.300
- As Sandburg says,
"Give it birth."

31:44.803 --> 31:47.139
Yes, go.
- Green light.

31:47.173 --> 31:48.907
- You got it.
- Got it.

31:50.009 --> 31:51.877
- Track down SeÃ±or Galindo.

31:51.910 --> 31:54.913
I think we should have
some face time today.

31:54.947 --> 31:56.949
I am, uh...

31:56.983 --> 31:59.285
I'm curious to see
if he'll blink.

32:01.020 --> 32:02.955
- Okay, let's go.

32:02.989 --> 32:04.991
- Yes, ma'am.

32:07.759 --> 32:09.661
- Hmm.

32:09.695 --> 32:11.563
Adelita.

32:11.597 --> 32:13.932
- All right,
we have been activated.

32:13.966 --> 32:16.902
You all know your assignments.
Gear up.

32:26.878 --> 32:28.314
These are our locals.

32:28.347 --> 32:30.416
Make sure they get
their next payment.

32:30.449 --> 32:31.683
- You got it.

32:48.300 --> 32:51.170
That bastard
in your belly...

32:51.203 --> 32:53.639
it's the only reason
I haven't slit your throat.

32:56.508 --> 32:58.344
- And maybe someday,

32:58.377 --> 33:01.613
that bastard will slit yours.

33:25.771 --> 33:27.673
- Got movement.

33:28.840 --> 33:31.310
- We got six mercs...

33:31.343 --> 33:34.446
and looks like
a pregnant woman.

33:36.048 --> 33:38.517
- That's Hobart with her.
- Is it Adelita?

33:38.550 --> 33:40.186
- Here they come.

33:47.893 --> 33:50.862
- Fuck, got her hooded.

34:00.972 --> 34:03.575
- Heading west.

34:03.609 --> 34:05.511
- Call it in.
Let everyone know.

34:05.544 --> 34:06.912
They're headed
toward Alvarez.

34:06.945 --> 34:08.547
This has gotta be the decoy.

34:09.948 --> 34:11.717
- We'll call Alvarez.

34:14.920 --> 34:18.790
- Why put Hobart
on a bullshit run?

34:18.824 --> 34:20.859
He's their shot caller.

34:20.892 --> 34:23.295
What if Galindo was wrong...

34:23.329 --> 34:25.531
and that was Adelita
in the first one?

34:25.564 --> 34:27.133
- If the second one
never leaves,

34:27.166 --> 34:28.600
then we make that decision.

34:28.634 --> 34:30.702
- What decision?

34:30.736 --> 34:33.872
Alvarez takes down
the fucking transport.

34:56.495 --> 34:59.198
- Trinkets for your darling?

35:00.132 --> 35:01.767
- Something like that.

35:03.369 --> 35:05.237
I didn't expect
to see you today,

35:05.271 --> 35:06.772
everything that's going on.

35:06.805 --> 35:08.807
- Sometimes things
run more smoothly

35:08.840 --> 35:10.742
when I'm not around.

35:10.776 --> 35:14.946
And besides, with your men
helping us now...

35:14.980 --> 35:16.815
my mind's at ease.

35:18.617 --> 35:22.288
Thought I might do
a little shopping myself.

35:25.056 --> 35:27.426
- Good for you.
Enjoy.

35:27.459 --> 35:29.528
- Maybe you can help me.

35:35.834 --> 35:38.304
New girlfriend.

35:38.337 --> 35:40.172
I-I want to get her
something special,

35:40.206 --> 35:43.942
something that says,
"I really want this to work,"

35:43.975 --> 35:46.144
a, uh...

35:46.178 --> 35:49.114
A thoughtful token
that establishes trust

35:49.147 --> 35:51.950
and--and...

35:51.983 --> 35:54.886
dare I say, commitment.

35:54.920 --> 35:56.255
- Mm.

35:59.425 --> 36:01.727
Maybe buy her flowers,

36:01.760 --> 36:06.298
take her to dinner,
or, you know...

36:06.332 --> 36:09.835
just tell her how you feel.

36:11.670 --> 36:14.806
The gifts, promises,
hyperbolic flattery--

36:14.840 --> 36:18.644
at the end of the day,
they're meaningless...

36:18.677 --> 36:20.979
hollow.

36:21.012 --> 36:22.814
- Hmm.

36:22.848 --> 36:27.185
- A woman worthy of your
affection would know that.

36:28.687 --> 36:29.921
- Hmm.

36:31.857 --> 36:34.460
You are very wise, seÃ±or.

36:36.462 --> 36:39.164
I know we got off
to a rocky start,

36:39.197 --> 36:43.269
but our arrangement...

36:44.803 --> 36:47.773
I really feel
like we're in sync now.

36:50.242 --> 36:51.877
Would you agree?

36:54.380 --> 36:56.315
- I hope that's true.

36:58.550 --> 37:00.185
You set the pace, Mr. Potter.

37:00.218 --> 37:01.953
I'm just following your lead.

37:03.555 --> 37:07.559
Trying not to make the same
mistakes my father made.

37:13.098 --> 37:15.200
Good luck with the girl.

37:15.233 --> 37:16.835
- Thank you.

37:32.318 --> 37:33.719
Hmm.

37:46.765 --> 37:49.801
I, uh--I think
we need to change our plan.

37:49.835 --> 37:52.070
- Why?

37:52.103 --> 37:53.405
Did Galindo blink?

37:53.439 --> 37:56.241
- No, but, uh,

37:56.274 --> 37:58.444
I'm afraid I may have.

37:59.277 --> 38:00.512
I can't read him.

38:00.546 --> 38:02.581
I don't like that.

38:02.614 --> 38:04.983
Let's, uh--let's play it safe.

38:05.016 --> 38:09.355
Call Hobart's men.
We'll go to scenario three.

38:09.388 --> 38:12.123
Okay?
- Yeah.

38:37.649 --> 38:40.786
- Must have been rough
doing eight years...

38:40.819 --> 38:41.987
looking at 20.

38:43.655 --> 38:45.891
Shit, 18 months in Chino

38:45.924 --> 38:47.993
almost killed me.

38:49.327 --> 38:51.363
- You figure it out.

38:53.832 --> 38:55.667
After a while...

38:59.538 --> 39:00.739
It's all you know.

39:05.677 --> 39:07.379
- You mad I didn't
come up that much?

39:11.683 --> 39:12.951
- No.

39:14.085 --> 39:17.556
- I was a shitty brother.
- Not anymore.

39:26.565 --> 39:28.867
You're gonna be
a good father, Angel.

39:38.376 --> 39:40.378
- What happens here, bro?

39:42.414 --> 39:44.249
You know, with her...

39:44.282 --> 39:47.052
a baby?

39:49.254 --> 39:51.089
You know I'ma
fuck it all up.

40:00.566 --> 40:03.935
- Your promise to Adelita...

40:03.969 --> 40:06.071
carrying the weight
of that secret...

40:08.607 --> 40:11.242
The shit that went down

40:11.276 --> 40:12.978
with you and Bishop
last night...

40:15.313 --> 40:17.916
Clearly, you put
your family first.

40:20.418 --> 40:23.388
Look at us.

40:23.421 --> 40:25.657
Fucking cholo brigade.

40:34.032 --> 40:37.836
Everyone talks about love
and family...

40:38.604 --> 40:41.907
But people don't do
what you're doing, Angel.

40:41.940 --> 40:43.408
In any world.

40:48.179 --> 40:50.015
And if you ever forget that

40:50.048 --> 40:53.251
or have any doubt
about how good you are,

40:53.284 --> 40:55.687
I'll be there...

40:55.721 --> 40:57.255
to slap you
in back of the head.

41:00.325 --> 41:02.027
- Gentle reminder.

41:06.164 --> 41:07.699
- Got something.

41:07.733 --> 41:11.336
- It's dÃ©jÃ  fucking vu.

41:13.505 --> 41:15.507
- This has gotta be them.

41:23.649 --> 41:25.216
- That's it.

41:32.658 --> 41:34.526
This is it.
Gear up.

41:39.364 --> 41:41.166
- Get your gear, boy scout.

41:55.547 --> 41:58.183
- What the fuck?

41:58.216 --> 41:59.417
- Coming.

42:38.990 --> 42:40.926
- He's staying on course,
due east.

42:46.231 --> 42:49.134
- We gotta do this
before he hits the desert.

42:49.167 --> 42:50.769
If Potter has
state police on call,

42:50.802 --> 42:52.437
that backup will be too close.

42:52.470 --> 42:55.807
- Gives us about 20, 25 miles,

42:55.841 --> 42:56.942
but the towns get
more populated

42:56.975 --> 42:58.309
before we hit the sand.

42:58.343 --> 43:00.278
- Yeah, we should do it soon.

43:00.311 --> 43:02.547
This is about as remote
as we're gonna get.

43:02.580 --> 43:05.116
- Copy that. Eyes are open.

43:23.468 --> 43:25.136
- Hi, Felipe.

43:30.441 --> 43:32.277
How are you?
Ooh.

43:32.310 --> 43:33.845
- I'm good.

43:33.879 --> 43:35.146
- Okay, what do you need?

43:35.180 --> 43:36.414
I have more stuff
inside the box, of course.

43:36.447 --> 43:37.849
- No, I'm good, thank you.

43:37.883 --> 43:39.951
I just wanted to, uh,

43:39.985 --> 43:42.688
talk to you for a little.

43:45.156 --> 43:46.758
- Okay.

43:46.792 --> 43:49.127
Wait a minute.

43:56.401 --> 43:58.269
Here, sit down.

43:58.303 --> 43:59.504
- Oh.

44:03.842 --> 44:06.144
- What's on your mind?

44:11.149 --> 44:15.286
- You know what's going on
with Miguel's mother.

44:18.323 --> 44:23.461
Her mood, her behavior,
it's just taking a toll...

44:23.494 --> 44:26.164
on Miguel, me, the family.

44:28.099 --> 44:32.670
We're just trying to figure out
the right thing to do.

44:32.704 --> 44:36.074
- If this is about me
driving...

44:36.107 --> 44:40.178
Dita back home,
Alvarez already put me on, uh--

44:40.211 --> 44:43.314
- No, it is about...

44:43.348 --> 44:44.916
you and Dita,

44:44.950 --> 44:47.285
but I am not trying
to push you away, Felipe.

44:49.020 --> 44:51.022
The other day,
I saw your truck parked

44:51.056 --> 44:54.092
near the medical building

44:54.125 --> 44:56.161
where Dita had her appointment.

45:00.598 --> 45:02.000
I'm guessing
she spent more time

45:02.033 --> 45:03.769
talking to you than her shrink.

45:04.803 --> 45:06.271
- Well, you're gonna have
to ask her that.

45:06.304 --> 45:08.406
- That is the problem:

45:08.439 --> 45:10.776
she won't tell us anything.

45:15.213 --> 45:18.750
Do you know what happened
that night?

45:18.784 --> 45:21.352
The fire?

45:21.386 --> 45:23.789
- Yes.

45:23.822 --> 45:27.092
- Then you understand
why we're worried.

45:28.794 --> 45:31.897
- I don't know
anything more than you do.

45:56.587 --> 45:59.157
That's you...

45:59.190 --> 46:00.892
with Dita.

46:07.765 --> 46:10.301
Ignacio Cortina.

46:10.335 --> 46:14.005
Federal police
out of Sonora.

46:14.039 --> 46:16.942
Were you working
for Miguel's father?

46:16.975 --> 46:19.010
Protection?

46:20.445 --> 46:22.580
- Where'd you get this?

46:22.613 --> 46:26.484
- I found a similar photo
in Dita's room.

46:26.517 --> 46:29.921
I knew it was you.

46:29.955 --> 46:31.990
It just didn't make any sense,

46:32.023 --> 46:35.293
so I went to storage,
looked through family records,

46:35.326 --> 46:37.195
found these...

46:43.301 --> 46:46.371
All with Dita's personal stuff.

46:46.404 --> 46:47.873
Travel itineraries.

46:47.906 --> 46:49.875
Like, that's Venezuela.

46:49.908 --> 46:53.111
There's New York,
San Francisco, Venice.

46:53.144 --> 46:54.679
There was more in the box.

46:54.712 --> 46:59.317
You were with Dita
every time she left Sonora.

47:02.520 --> 47:05.223
Her...

47:05.256 --> 47:06.892
protector?

47:09.027 --> 47:10.996
- These things...

47:14.599 --> 47:17.168
They were buried in a box.

47:23.008 --> 47:25.076
They were there for a reason.

47:25.110 --> 47:27.078
They should have been burned.

47:28.279 --> 47:31.582
None of this can help you
or Dita.

47:31.616 --> 47:34.352
You have to trust me, Emily.

47:36.354 --> 47:38.089
This history...

47:41.026 --> 47:44.329
All it will do
is hurt the ones you love.

48:07.218 --> 48:10.055
I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

48:12.057 --> 48:15.626
Does he know...
about the photos?

48:16.962 --> 48:19.630
All the stuff you found?

48:19.664 --> 48:21.967
- EZ?
- No.

48:22.000 --> 48:24.702
Miguel, your husband.

48:24.735 --> 48:27.105
Has he seen it?

48:28.573 --> 48:31.276
- No.

48:31.309 --> 48:33.544
No one has.

48:51.129 --> 48:52.463
- Keep her quiet.

49:03.008 --> 49:04.775
- Gotta do it now.

49:04.809 --> 49:06.511
- We're moving in.

49:09.280 --> 49:10.481
- Right behind you.

49:22.460 --> 49:25.163
- Hey, we got a tail.
You clocking this?

49:30.168 --> 49:32.170
- What is going on?

49:32.203 --> 49:34.705
- Dude, her water just broke!

49:34.739 --> 49:36.774
- Motherfucker!

49:43.714 --> 49:46.617
- What the hell is this?

49:46.651 --> 49:47.952
- No idea.

49:58.729 --> 50:00.298
- You okay?

50:00.331 --> 50:02.900
- It's not her.
- What's the plan?

50:02.933 --> 50:05.070
- Just drive.

50:22.053 --> 50:24.822
- Fuck!

50:24.855 --> 50:25.990
She's gotta be
in the first car.

50:26.023 --> 50:27.692
Wasn't a decoy.

50:27.725 --> 50:29.594
Alvarez will have
to take the car down.

50:29.627 --> 50:33.498
- Yeah, I got Alvarez's
sat phone lighting up.

50:33.531 --> 50:36.434
He's got about a half an hour
before he hits TJ.

50:36.467 --> 50:39.670
This time of day,
it'll be jammed.

50:39.704 --> 50:41.706
Stop-and-go traffic.

50:41.739 --> 50:43.841
- Fuck.

50:54.552 --> 50:56.287
- It wasn't stopping
for the kids.

50:57.922 --> 50:59.857
- What are you talking about?

50:59.890 --> 51:02.093
- There was a third car,
a blue station wagon.

51:02.127 --> 51:04.195
I saw it
when I went back for the gear.

51:04.229 --> 51:05.363
It pulled in front
of the carport.

51:05.396 --> 51:07.365
I-I thought it stopped
for the kids.

51:07.398 --> 51:09.567
- Shit, it was waiting
for other passengers.

51:09.600 --> 51:12.237
- Prospect, who was in the car?

51:12.270 --> 51:13.471
- Too far for details,

51:13.504 --> 51:15.106
but it looked like a man
and woman.

51:15.140 --> 51:16.974
- Woman could be
one of Potter's.

51:17.007 --> 51:19.144
- The station wagon's
heading to Mexicali.

51:19.177 --> 51:21.379
Had to stay south to avoid us.

51:21.412 --> 51:24.449
- Yeah, but once you clear
these two towns,

51:24.482 --> 51:27.152
everything leads to Route 2.

51:27.185 --> 51:29.754
It's the only way
to the hole in the wall.

51:30.455 --> 51:32.657
- If Alvarez has to take down
that transport,

51:32.690 --> 51:34.892
who knows what the fuck
Potter will do?

51:34.925 --> 51:36.661
Everything blows up.

51:38.929 --> 51:41.566
- If she's in that third car,

51:41.599 --> 51:44.302
we can catch it
before Alvarez crosses.

51:47.172 --> 51:48.739
- You won't have
to make that call.

51:53.444 --> 51:56.147
- We can buy a ride
to the tunnel.

51:58.149 --> 51:59.650
- Then pick your crew.

51:59.684 --> 52:01.552
Go get Adelita.

52:03.288 --> 52:06.123
- Creep, you with us.
- All right.

52:06.157 --> 52:07.525
- Let's move.
- Let's ride.

52:25.676 --> 52:26.644
- Yeah.

52:33.150 --> 52:34.285
What's your ETA?

52:34.319 --> 52:36.821
- We just crossed marker 234.

52:36.854 --> 52:40.191
- Everything good
with our asset?

52:40.225 --> 52:42.193
- Yeah.

52:42.227 --> 52:43.328
- Okay, good.

52:49.534 --> 52:51.001
- That was Agent Collins.

52:51.035 --> 52:52.470
Scenario three's
going smoothly,

52:52.503 --> 52:55.506
so Adelita should be here
just about sunset.

52:55.540 --> 52:56.874
- Lovely.

52:56.907 --> 53:00.311
And our army limousine?
- On schedule.

53:00.345 --> 53:01.879
I didn't think you'd want
two tactical Humvees

53:01.912 --> 53:04.148
sitting by a hole in the wall
until it was dark.

53:04.181 --> 53:05.683
- Hmm.

53:12.890 --> 53:14.692
Hmm.

53:24.569 --> 53:26.337
- Yeah.

53:26.371 --> 53:27.938
Okay, primo, let us know.

53:32.543 --> 53:34.245
Adelita wasn't in
the other car.

53:37.982 --> 53:39.350
- What do we do?

53:42.387 --> 53:44.021
- Load everything we got.

53:44.054 --> 53:47.792
- * But you ain't
just exactly sure what's hip *

53:49.894 --> 53:51.596
* Starting to let
your hair grow *

53:51.629 --> 53:54.299
* Spend big bucks
to top your wardrobe *

53:54.332 --> 53:55.433
* But somehow you know

53:55.466 --> 53:58.369
- This might be it.

53:58.403 --> 53:59.804
- * What is hip?

53:59.837 --> 54:03.073
- * Tell me, tell me
if you think you know *

54:03.107 --> 54:04.241
- * What is hip?

54:04.275 --> 54:05.876
- * If you're really hip

54:05.910 --> 54:08.613
* The passing years
will show *

54:08.646 --> 54:10.381
- That's it.

54:10.415 --> 54:12.283
- * Maybe hipper than hip

54:12.317 --> 54:13.284
* What is hip?

54:15.620 --> 54:16.887
- Someone's coming up
pretty hot.

54:16.921 --> 54:18.323
- Should I call it in?

54:18.356 --> 54:19.757
- Hold on.

54:29.266 --> 54:31.769
Shit.

54:31.802 --> 54:33.170
Yeah, call him.

54:44.349 --> 54:46.250
- Yeah.

54:46.283 --> 54:48.919
Shit.

54:48.953 --> 54:50.688
- Give it to me.

54:50.721 --> 54:52.089
Hello?
What's happening?

54:54.459 --> 54:55.760
- They're definitely not
friendlies.

54:55.793 --> 54:57.628
We're trying to outrun them.

54:57.662 --> 55:00.097
- * What is hip?

55:00.130 --> 55:01.832
- Hello?

55:01.866 --> 55:03.368
Agent?

55:03.401 --> 55:06.671
Linares, call our friends
at PolicÃ­a Estata now.

55:06.704 --> 55:08.172
- * The passing years
will show *

55:08.205 --> 55:09.340
- Agent Collins!

55:12.343 --> 55:13.711
- * What is hip?

55:13.744 --> 55:15.780
- * I, I'd like to know

55:15.813 --> 55:16.814
- Shit!

55:16.847 --> 55:18.816
- Get ready!

55:18.849 --> 55:21.218
- * Is it in the style
of your hair? *

55:23.153 --> 55:24.489
- It's the fucking M.C.

55:24.522 --> 55:25.690
- * The clothes
that you wear? *

55:26.724 --> 55:28.626
- Collins!

55:28.659 --> 55:30.861
- * What is hip, y'all?

55:30.895 --> 55:33.464
- That's her!
She's in the back!

55:33.498 --> 55:35.700
You gotta slow down!
- Hold on!

55:35.733 --> 55:38.302
- Hey, Coco,
ready, ready, ready?

55:38.335 --> 55:40.938
- Easy!
Careful!

55:41.506 --> 55:42.640
- Yeah, go, go, go, go.

55:42.673 --> 55:45.042
- * I wanna know what hip is

55:48.713 --> 55:51.849
- It's not slowing down!
- What are you doing?

56:01.526 --> 56:03.994
- Fuck, y'all.

56:15.973 --> 56:17.908
- Oh, Jesus, thank God.
- Angel?

56:17.942 --> 56:20.377
- Come here, come here,
come here, come here.

56:22.647 --> 56:25.082
What are you doing here?

56:25.115 --> 56:26.517
- What do you mean?

56:27.918 --> 56:30.054
- You have to go,
all of you.

56:30.087 --> 56:31.589
- What are you talking about?
We came for you!

56:31.622 --> 56:34.191
- No, I can't go.

56:35.826 --> 56:37.528
This is what needs to happen.

56:37.562 --> 56:39.597
Potter thinks I'm the threat.

56:39.630 --> 56:41.632
If he has me, he'll stop
chasing everything else:

56:41.666 --> 56:43.634
Montserrat, Galindo.

56:43.668 --> 56:46.203
It all keeps going,
everything we planned.

56:46.236 --> 56:48.539
- No, that--come on, please.
Come on, come on, come on!

56:48.573 --> 56:51.375
- Angel, I need you
to keep it going, please.

56:53.143 --> 56:54.378
Promise me.

56:56.413 --> 56:58.649
- Come on, Angel, we gotta go!

57:00.417 --> 57:02.620
- We'll be fine.

57:03.854 --> 57:06.557
- Please don't.
- You have to let me go.

57:06.591 --> 57:07.825
- Please don't.

57:07.858 --> 57:10.928
- Angel, come on, dog!
Come on!

57:13.130 --> 57:15.232
- Okay, Angel, we gotta go.

57:15.265 --> 57:16.567
Come on.
Come with me.

57:16.601 --> 57:17.702
- Come on, hermano!

57:18.603 --> 57:22.406
- Angel, we gotta go!
Now, go!

57:22.439 --> 57:25.776
- Go!
- Come on!

57:25.810 --> 57:28.412
- Let's go! Let's go!
- Go, go, go, go, go!

58:39.383 --> 58:43.120
(hard rock music plays)

58:45.122 --> 58:47.692
Esta es mi familia.

58:51.562 --> 58:54.498
This... is my family.

58:54.531 --> 58:56.867
(laughing)

58:57.602 --> 58:59.837
You either get in line...

58:59.870 --> 59:01.872
Or you get run out.

59:01.906 --> 59:04.241
ALL: Divided, we fall.
United, we roll.

59:05.810 --> 59:09.213
ANNOUNCER: Mayans.
All new Tuesdays at 10:00 on FX.

59:11.548 --> 59:14.184
-I'm cold.
-It's not cold. Just come to me.

59:14.218 --> 59:16.687
-I'll keep you warm, I promise.
-Fine.

59:16.721 --> 59:18.255
(woman giggling)

59:19.389 --> 59:20.424
(woman screams)

59:20.457 --> 59:22.459
ANNOUNCER: AHS 1984.

59:22.492 --> 59:24.929
All new,
Wednesdays at 10:00 on FX.

59:26.496 --> 59:28.032
-ALL: Three!
-I sharpen my teeth.

59:28.065 --> 59:29.466
-ALL: Two!
-Too hard, too fast.

59:29.499 --> 59:31.035
-ALL: One!
-Look what I just found.

59:31.068 --> 59:33.403
"Week long rental.
Bed to be shared with owners."

59:33.437 --> 59:35.105
What kind of people do you think
you're gonna attract?

59:35.139 --> 59:37.207
Bohemians
with no sexual boundaries.

59:37.241 --> 59:39.576
-(grunts)
-(snoring)

59:39.610 --> 59:41.545
-You guys know
what this means, right?
-No.

59:41.578 --> 59:42.980
ANNOUNCER: Sunny is back.

59:43.013 --> 59:45.950
All new,
Wednesdays at 10:00 on FXX.

59:47.517 --> 59:50.988
(deep voices chanting)
I... know... more.

59:51.021 --> 59:53.791
I think I'd make
a great drag queen.
Like, for real.

59:53.824 --> 59:57.494
But the one time I tried it,
I looked so much like my mom,
it scared me.

59:57.527 --> 59:59.163
And I was sexy as hell.

59:59.196 --> 1:00:01.832
(deep voices chanting)

1:00:03.433 --> 1:00:05.636
You can't make people
like you,

1:00:05.670 --> 1:00:08.072
but if people
don't respect you,

1:00:08.105 --> 1:00:09.539
you can make 'em fear you.
