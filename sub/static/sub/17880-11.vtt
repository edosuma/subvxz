00:03.898 --> 00:05.839
Veronica! A quick question.

00:05.874 --> 00:08.449
What is it with everyone and their questions this morning?

00:08.505 --> 00:10.396
"Where did you learn to drive?", "will you marry me?",

00:10.431 --> 00:12.598
"why would you say that to my baby?"

00:12.633 --> 00:16.038
Rose is running for 3rd grade class president.
And some of the guys from the print shop

00:16.116 --> 00:18.645
whipped out these campaign posters.

00:18.680 --> 00:21.091
What do you think? Too much? Not enough?

00:21.669 --> 00:24.044
Ted, you don't have to go through all this.

00:24.079 --> 00:26.180
Just say the word and the election's hers.

00:26.215 --> 00:29.384
We did for Iceland, and we can do it for your kid.

00:31.829 --> 00:33.443
Oh! Flowers!

00:33.478 --> 00:35.606
Look at you. Having a girly moment.

00:35.695 --> 00:38.189
Crap on a cracker.
And she's back.

00:38.224 --> 00:39.934
From my stinking father.

00:40.008 --> 00:43.537
I need status report on every
product we have in the pipeline.

00:43.572 --> 00:44.709
I should explain.

00:44.744 --> 00:48.715
Veronica and her dad don't have what you
call a traditional father-daughter relationship.

00:49.448 --> 00:53.479
Veronica's father is Elijah Palmer,
CEO of Digivation industries.

00:53.514 --> 00:54.936
One of our company main rivals.

00:54.971 --> 00:57.089
Digivation Industries has long been working

00:57.124 --> 00:59.617
to develop a new more powerful battery.

00:59.652 --> 01:02.118
One that could last up to seven years.

01:02.153 --> 01:05.089
Veronica and her dad are both extremely competitive.

01:05.123 --> 01:08.151
And have an history of stealing prodycts from each others companies.

01:08.221 --> 01:09.310
So ...

01:09.488 --> 01:12.948
I am proud to stand here today to present to you...

01:20.500 --> 01:22.596
Absolutely nothing. Thank you all for coming.

01:22.631 --> 01:24.529
It's a little cat and mouse game they play,

01:24.564 --> 01:27.337
instead of having a normal healthy relationship.

01:27.602 --> 01:29.952
Hover shoes. Brilliant.

01:30.833 --> 01:33.117
You better take a look at this.

01:50.143 --> 01:52.823
And every time one of them steals an idea from the other,

01:52.858 --> 01:55.518
the winner sends the loser a thankyou present.

01:55.596 --> 01:59.800
Hey, did you guys hear? Digivation is coming
up with a new weight-loss toothpaste.

01:59.862 --> 02:00.872
Damn it!

02:00.907 --> 02:02.759
Aren't we developing something like that?

02:02.794 --> 02:03.850
Oh! Flowers!

02:04.549 --> 02:07.099
They really steal product ideas from each other?

02:07.134 --> 02:09.925
That's a whole new kind of crazy.
Well, it's a little strange...

02:09.960 --> 02:13.340
But I am the last one to judge.
My father and I hardly speak.

02:13.375 --> 02:16.773
We're like Oil and... what's that thing that's always disappointing Oil?

02:16.808 --> 02:18.158
Oh, yeah . It's me.

02:18.207 --> 02:20.569
My dad and I totally love each other.

02:20.604 --> 02:23.978
Oh, I'm sorry. Does your obvious pain
make that an insensitive thing to say?

02:24.013 --> 02:27.324
No. No, I am totally fine with the fact that nothing I have ever done

02:27.359 --> 02:30.567
or will do, could ever please my father. Or make up for the fact

02:30.577 --> 02:33.763
that I did not become the plumber,
he so desperately wanted me to be.

02:33.798 --> 02:35.871
I talk to my dad every week.
Oh.

02:35.906 --> 02:39.892
Well, usually, my mom takes the phone,
but that's ok, 'cause I totally love her too.

02:39.927 --> 02:42.397
And sometimes grandma picks up the phone...
Oh, that's fantastic,

02:42.432 --> 02:45.582
there's a whole lot of love in your family and not in mine.

02:45.874 --> 02:48.293
You should get the "Family of the Year" award.
Do they have one of those?

02:48.303 --> 02:50.400
Because we would totally kick ass.

02:54.766 --> 02:57.186
I just talked to Linda about her father... man...

02:57.221 --> 02:58.734
I'm never gonna do that again!

02:58.769 --> 03:00.380
I have the best ad.

03:00.443 --> 03:03.775
All he ever want was for me to have a better life than him.

03:04.178 --> 03:05.319
So what's your deal?

03:05.354 --> 03:07.200
Oh, my dad died when I was three.

03:07.235 --> 03:10.323
Oh ... so, he may have been a horrible man.

03:10.487 --> 03:13.647
A horrible man who died saving
30 people from a burning bus.

03:13.682 --> 03:15.366
The newspapers said his last words were

03:15.401 --> 03:17.723
he loved me more than all the stars in the universe.

03:17.758 --> 03:20.519
Now that I'm a scientist I know that meant his love was infinite

03:20.554 --> 03:22.127
and ever expanding.

03:22.162 --> 03:25.601
My father once got kicked out of a
zoo for giving a monkey a cigarette.

03:25.799 --> 03:28.299
So, what's the result on the wrinkle cream?

03:28.695 --> 03:30.254
It's a disaster.
A debacle.

03:30.289 --> 03:31.330
A disastercle.

03:31.365 --> 03:33.434
The synthetic skin graf show no increase

03:33.469 --> 03:35.387
in suppleness or elasticity.

03:35.422 --> 03:38.105
All that's happening is they're growing thick strands of hair.

03:38.140 --> 03:40.440
It's like my aunt's chin before she plucks it for church.

03:40.475 --> 03:43.755
This happens every time?
Yes , we failed. You stop screaming at us.

03:43.790 --> 03:46.429
Guys, you didn't fail! You're growing hair!

03:46.464 --> 03:49.417
This is the Holy Grail of Reasearch and Development.

03:49.452 --> 03:52.178
Every R&D department in the country is looking for this.

03:52.213 --> 03:54.436
This discovery could make us legends.

03:54.471 --> 03:56.453
I love when Ted's happy.
Me too.

03:56.488 --> 03:58.500
I know just the song we should sing when he leaves.

03:58.535 --> 04:01.659
We're making Ted happy and we're going to go down in history.

04:01.694 --> 04:04.218
God, my dad is gonna be so proud.

04:04.491 --> 04:06.973
I'll drop the proposal and get the paperwork at it.

04:07.008 --> 04:09.397
If all goes well, we could start work on this by next fall.

04:09.432 --> 04:13.087
Next fall? No, we can't wait that long. We gotta keep moving.

04:13.178 --> 04:15.545
But... what about protocol?
Forget protocol!

04:15.580 --> 04:18.986
Did Einstein stop to fill out paperwork
before discovering his theory of relativity?

04:19.021 --> 04:22.394
Actually, he was a patent clerk, so all he did was filling out paperwork.

04:22.429 --> 04:23.971
Guys, keep going.

04:24.118 --> 04:27.787
If this is successful, we could do to the comb over
what Einstein did to...

04:28.004 --> 04:29.518
Newtonian physics.

04:31.410 --> 04:33.481
See? I know things about stuff.

04:36.629 --> 04:39.546
Ok, honey. So, you just introduce you, you walk in front of the class.

04:39.581 --> 04:42.854
You're projecting this strength and
leadership of a future class president.

04:42.889 --> 04:44.928
You have smartly peed before hand, so you're not all squirmy

04:44.963 --> 04:47.766
Dad, can I say my speech while I'm still on third grade?

04:47.801 --> 04:49.550
Yes, sorry... go ahead.

04:50.295 --> 04:51.610
Hi, I'm Rose.

04:51.905 --> 04:53.139
Vote for me.

04:53.300 --> 04:54.514
Please.

04:54.549 --> 04:55.816
Thank you.

04:55.851 --> 04:57.123
You're welcome.

04:59.476 --> 05:01.381
And the crowd goes wild.

05:02.233 --> 05:05.131
That was great.
You know, the only thing that class president does

05:05.166 --> 05:08.049
is go to student councils meetings, and feed the gerbils.

05:08.084 --> 05:10.027
I don't even know if I want to win.

05:10.062 --> 05:11.651
The gerbils kind of a junk.

05:11.686 --> 05:14.214
Of course you want to win,
honey, you're just nervous.

05:14.249 --> 05:15.992
But you are gonna be great.

05:16.027 --> 05:19.057
I'm gonna go take a bath, maybe color a little.

05:19.244 --> 05:20.552
You know, unwind.

05:22.863 --> 05:25.183
I always encourage Rose to dream big,

05:25.218 --> 05:28.572
because the only thing my father have encouraged
me to do is be a plumber, like him.

05:29.109 --> 05:32.859
You biked all the way down here to tell me you wanna go to spacecamp?

05:32.894 --> 05:36.336
Come on, try to live here on Earth with the rest of us, Teddy.

05:36.737 --> 05:38.909
While I was trying to be a good dad,

05:38.944 --> 05:41.222
Veronica's dad had gotten under her skin.

05:41.337 --> 05:45.297
So she called the guys from corporate intelligence
to help her get some daughterly payback.

05:45.332 --> 05:48.068
Nobody steals my weight-loss toothpaste and gets away with it.

05:48.103 --> 05:50.125
I want to bring him to his knees.

05:50.160 --> 05:52.907
No, I will steal his kneeds, can we do that?

05:52.942 --> 05:56.019
Well, joints stealing technology is still years away but...

05:56.054 --> 05:59.380
our inside at Digivation did gave us a lead on one of the hotter projects.

05:59.526 --> 06:01.593
Marine mammal communication.

06:01.895 --> 06:03.829
That you talk to whales. The device...

06:03.839 --> 06:05.460
That doesn't work.
Dad!

06:05.528 --> 06:07.463
Or rather, it does work, but it's useless.

06:07.498 --> 06:10.549
The whales are shallowed tweets. All
they do is gossip and spread rumors.

06:10.584 --> 06:12.215
It's like talking to teenage girls.

06:12.250 --> 06:14.194
Well, you'd know all about that.

06:14.229 --> 06:17.004
Gentlemen, please excuse us.
Yes , off you go fellas.

06:17.039 --> 06:20.601
There's a large woman on the fourth floor with of
our listening device embedded in her derriere.

06:20.636 --> 06:22.251
See if you can sniff it out.

06:22.965 --> 06:23.965
So...

06:24.147 --> 06:27.298
Obviously, that whale thing is a winner
or you wouldn't be telling me it's a loser.

06:27.333 --> 06:30.602
Unless it's really a loser and I'm pretending
it's a loser, to make you think it's a winner.

06:30.637 --> 06:33.676
Or am I pretending to think it's a winner, when I actually know that's a loser

06:33.711 --> 06:36.046
because you said it was loser to make me think it's a winner.

06:36.056 --> 06:38.439
So... the student become the master.

06:38.474 --> 06:40.546
Or the student has always been the master,

06:40.581 --> 06:44.796
but wanted the master to think the master was
the master, when he was actually just a student.

06:45.108 --> 06:47.426
This conversation is why your mother left us.

06:47.461 --> 06:50.100
That and the fact that you poured your way through my sorory.

06:52.129 --> 06:53.238
Look, Ted.

06:53.273 --> 06:57.543
We were able to successfully grow hair on a
living organism which previously had no hair.

06:57.596 --> 07:00.992
Here! Three, no longer bald, potatoes.

07:02.417 --> 07:06.428
We isolated the follicle generating coumpoud and atomized it into...

07:06.463 --> 07:08.422
an aerosol.
This is incredible.

07:08.457 --> 07:10.933
I want to start testing.
But we are testing.

07:10.968 --> 07:12.441
See, testers...

07:12.476 --> 07:13.876
testies, testing.

07:13.945 --> 07:15.373
You said testies?

07:15.863 --> 07:18.102
Oh my God, that's hilarious.
Guys.

07:18.137 --> 07:20.415
Focus. I mean human testing.

07:20.597 --> 07:22.748
Ted, we can't test it on humans,

07:22.783 --> 07:24.717
there's a whole protocol we have to follow.

07:24.752 --> 07:28.279
But first we have to test it on a rat,
then a bat, then for some reason a hat,

07:28.337 --> 07:30.182
I think that started as a typo.
Then a cat...

07:30.217 --> 07:33.407
Forget about it guys, I'm telling you, I want you to speed this along.

07:34.394 --> 07:35.394
No.

07:36.139 --> 07:37.139
What?

07:37.410 --> 07:38.931
He said no.

07:39.884 --> 07:42.332
At least, I think that's what he said. There's...

07:42.367 --> 07:44.696
a lot of blood rushing through my ears right now.

07:44.731 --> 07:48.743
We are not mad scientists, Ted, regardless
of what our bowling shirts might say.

07:48.778 --> 07:52.282
Guys, when I ask you to do
something, I expect you to do it.

07:54.469 --> 07:55.652
Apparently

07:56.303 --> 07:57.929
we're standing our ground.

07:57.964 --> 07:58.964
Fine.

07:59.055 --> 08:02.284
Then I'm gonna get you bowling shirts that say "boss-disappointing, protocol-loving

08:02.345 --> 08:04.278
unlegendary scientists "

08:18.076 --> 08:21.626
<i>We are working hard to make your life better.</i>

08:21.908 --> 08:25.688
<i> But our competitor, Digivation, wants to ruin your life.</i>

08:25.723 --> 08:30.299
<i> Since Digivation was founded 50
years ago, millions have died.</i>

08:30.387 --> 08:33.239
<i>Millions more have become sad.</i>

08:33.609 --> 08:35.921
<i> What's your problem, Digivation?</i>

08:42.426 --> 08:44.345
You came here to call a truce?

08:44.418 --> 08:47.346
'Cause I want things to be different between us now.

08:47.381 --> 08:49.444
You must be sitting on something huge,

08:49.479 --> 08:53.429
something so big you can't stand the thought of me stealing it.

08:53.464 --> 08:55.128
There's something I need to tell you.

09:01.753 --> 09:02.753
Ted.

09:03.268 --> 09:04.566
Mr. Palmer.

09:05.875 --> 09:07.281
Is that your dad?

09:07.463 --> 09:09.051
Why are you throwing him out of the building?

09:09.086 --> 09:11.079
He says he is dying.

09:17.743 --> 09:22.016
I know it's not my place to say anything,
but... my God, what is wrong with you?

09:22.454 --> 09:25.606
You mean, why do let employees to talk to me that way?

09:25.662 --> 09:28.953
Your father is dying, and you throw him out of the building?

09:29.085 --> 09:31.185
Oh, please, he's not dying.

09:31.604 --> 09:34.407
What is this? Dutch blend? I hate Dutch blend.

09:34.456 --> 09:37.031
And the Dutch too. Those people are lunatics,

09:37.186 --> 09:39.828
with their wooden shoes and their fatty sausages.

09:39.863 --> 09:41.663
What about your father?

09:41.940 --> 09:45.203
I don't know how he feels about the
Dutch, Linda. You'll have to ask him.

09:45.238 --> 09:47.474
I mean, how do you know he's not dying?

09:47.509 --> 09:51.909
Because I know how the man works. He's after something,
I just don't know what it is yet.

09:52.248 --> 09:55.948
Do you know the Dutch celebrate Christmas by throwing fruit at each other?

09:56.261 --> 09:57.811
I read that once.

09:58.183 --> 10:00.283
But what if he really is dying.

10:00.374 --> 10:04.562
What if it's not a lie, like all that stuff you just said about the Dutch?

10:06.398 --> 10:08.774
It can't be true. People don't just...

10:09.011 --> 10:11.661
Well, people do, but not my father.

10:12.011 --> 10:14.800
I mean, really, it's not in his nature to die.

10:16.523 --> 10:18.288
I have to check something.

10:21.878 --> 10:23.790
Veronica. What are you doing here?

10:23.881 --> 10:26.671
And who is this man?
This is my physician?

10:26.706 --> 10:29.058
Dr.... something-berg.
Rosenbaum.

10:29.093 --> 10:30.593
Rosenberg.
Rosenbaum.

10:30.628 --> 10:33.528
Stop arguing with me. That's not why we're here.

10:34.202 --> 10:37.502
I need to confirm that you're full of crap, not tumors.

10:38.399 --> 10:39.436
Well?

10:39.514 --> 10:42.483
He is telling the truth. That says he's gonna about a year left.

10:42.518 --> 10:44.620
What? That's impossible.

10:46.111 --> 10:48.559
Oh, my God. My dad is dying.

10:48.594 --> 10:50.621
There, there.

10:51.897 --> 10:54.380
At least now you'll have something to talk to your sister about

10:54.415 --> 10:56.465
besides all her stupid babies.

10:59.556 --> 11:01.145
Phil and Lem have refused to move forward

11:01.180 --> 11:02.756
on the hair growth formula.

11:02.791 --> 11:06.364
So I stole a sample and when they run downstairs to the ice cream truck.

11:06.399 --> 11:08.399
I'm gonna test it on myself.

11:08.982 --> 11:11.418
I know I'm being a little impatient, but...

11:11.453 --> 11:13.257
this project hits very close to home.

11:13.292 --> 11:15.623
So you made the chess team. One step closer

11:15.658 --> 11:17.789
to your life dream of being a giant nerd.

11:17.824 --> 11:20.721
Oh! Look at me. I'm valedictorian.

11:20.756 --> 11:22.503
whoopty-damn-doo

11:22.538 --> 11:24.793
Business school? The only business I care about

11:24.828 --> 11:27.533
is the one people do in their toilets.

11:27.568 --> 11:32.408
Tell me something, Teddy, when are you gonna get your
head out of your butt and do something useful,

11:32.510 --> 11:36.501
like figure out how to make that toupet that doesn't awol

11:36.536 --> 11:39.573
every time I crowl under a damn a sink?

11:40.429 --> 11:42.688
All my life I tried to make my dad happy,

11:42.723 --> 11:44.773
and I've never been able to.

11:45.177 --> 11:46.297
Until now,

11:46.632 --> 11:50.517
because now, I'm gonna give him something
ten times better than a toupet.

11:52.229 --> 11:54.479
And no, I don't mean ten toupets.

11:59.254 --> 12:01.203
My dad's sixtieth birthday is coming up.

12:01.238 --> 12:03.361
I was going to give him this.

12:04.439 --> 12:05.544
But now...

12:06.111 --> 12:07.695
I'm gonna give him this.

12:08.576 --> 12:09.678
Hair.

12:10.158 --> 12:11.682
It worked.

12:12.105 --> 12:13.957
We're almost out of orange juice

12:13.992 --> 12:16.742
and I don't want to be class president.
What?

12:16.995 --> 12:18.764
What's going on?
Well,

12:19.203 --> 12:21.357
I opened the refrigerator...
Rose.

12:21.392 --> 12:24.424
I just don't want to spend all my recesses in meetings.

12:24.459 --> 12:27.408
I'd rather play in the sandbox and make mud pies.

12:27.443 --> 12:29.193
Honey, you're just nervous.

12:29.736 --> 12:32.960
Look, I know it's not easy, but I
really think you should stick with it.

12:32.995 --> 12:35.463
You're gonna be the best class president ever.

12:36.095 --> 12:38.032
Allright.
Allright?

12:38.305 --> 12:39.378
Good.

12:39.763 --> 12:42.138
Being better than the last won't be hard.

12:42.173 --> 12:45.260
He ate pencils and kept calling our teacher "mommy."

12:47.559 --> 12:50.177
You were right. My father really is dying.

12:50.212 --> 12:52.641
Congratulations, cancer whisperer. You win.

12:52.651 --> 12:56.318
Oh, Veronica. I'm so sorry.

12:57.715 --> 12:59.338
It's okay, Linda.

12:59.421 --> 13:01.141
You'll get through this.

13:01.176 --> 13:05.067
I know I will. I'm trying to support you.

13:05.285 --> 13:07.411
So, how are you feeling?

13:07.598 --> 13:10.489
Oh. We're gonna talk about feelings now. Ok ...

13:10.929 --> 13:11.948
Sad.

13:13.737 --> 13:15.379
Yeah. It had to be felt.

13:15.414 --> 13:18.762
Veronica, you need to spend time with him,
do father-daughter things

13:18.772 --> 13:21.320
that don't invole stealing secrets.

13:21.355 --> 13:24.968
Indeed, steals his heart, fill it with love and then give it back.

13:25.515 --> 13:27.957
But not literally. That would be murder.

13:27.992 --> 13:29.507
Maybe you're right.

13:29.960 --> 13:32.787
I should connect with him before it's too late.

13:33.407 --> 13:37.098
Luckily I always done my best work under deadlines.

13:39.361 --> 13:43.419
And so, Veronica set up to start the
relationship with her father she never had.

14:01.634 --> 14:04.056
At first, it was a little confusing.

14:05.259 --> 14:07.846
So, they decided to do activities together.

14:26.928 --> 14:30.119
I made a list of the advantages and
disadvantages of standing up to Ted

14:30.154 --> 14:32.996
because I stood up to Ted and wanted
to know if there were any advantages.

14:33.163 --> 14:35.668
There are none.
That's why I tried to stop you.

14:35.703 --> 14:38.684
Ted is like the angle opposite the hypotenuse. He is always right.

14:38.746 --> 14:40.111
You did not try to stop me.

14:40.146 --> 14:42.146
I tried to try, but nothing came out.

14:42.181 --> 14:44.755
My head was screaming "No!", but my mouth was chewing gum.

14:47.443 --> 14:49.193
Hope he's not mad at us.

14:49.228 --> 14:50.756
We never stood up to Ted before.

14:50.791 --> 14:52.662
Technically, I still haven't.

14:53.564 --> 14:54.564
Guys.

14:54.845 --> 14:56.353
I need to see you in my office.

14:56.388 --> 14:58.633
It's about the hair growth formula.

14:59.861 --> 15:02.914
Is it terrified in here, or is it just me?

15:03.893 --> 15:06.082
So I snugged some of the spray in my office,

15:06.150 --> 15:07.874
and tried it on my arm,

15:07.909 --> 15:09.093
and it worked.

15:09.128 --> 15:13.143
Of course it did, because we said it wasn't
ready for human testing and you said it was.

15:13.178 --> 15:15.497
"We", There's a lot of "we" talk happening here

15:15.532 --> 15:17.458
and I don't think Ted cares for it.

15:22.197 --> 15:24.749
My desk is having a bad hair day.

15:26.259 --> 15:27.841
That's a little weird, huh?

15:33.347 --> 15:34.878
Incredible.

15:35.519 --> 15:39.201
The papilla are planting themselves on anything porous.

15:39.612 --> 15:44.068
When you used the aerosol, the overspray
must have hit these exposed surfaces.

15:44.103 --> 15:46.111
You know what that means?
Yes.

15:47.148 --> 15:49.382
The mutant follicles have turned parasitic,

15:49.417 --> 15:51.648
and are generating at an astronomical rate.

15:51.683 --> 15:54.286
And... I was right to question Ted.

15:54.321 --> 15:55.903
Yes, we were.

15:56.741 --> 15:59.799
Just let me handle this.
Yes, you were rigth to question.

15:59.975 --> 16:03.420
I was trying so hard to impress my dad, I lost sight of

16:03.549 --> 16:06.459
well, all the smooth surfaces of my desk.

16:07.024 --> 16:08.176
Anyway ...

16:08.291 --> 16:09.478
I'm sorry.

16:11.102 --> 16:12.324
We're cool.

16:14.163 --> 16:16.361
What's that growing out of your cuff?

16:18.360 --> 16:20.455
That would be my new shoulder hair.

16:24.375 --> 16:26.172
I had moral superiority

16:26.207 --> 16:30.085
Phil and Lem went to work trying to
find a solution to the hair in my office.

16:40.055 --> 16:43.020
While Lem and Phil are working for a more permanent solution

16:43.055 --> 16:46.283
I'm just trying to keep my office from
looking like this girl I used to date.

16:46.920 --> 16:49.951
It a long story, but yes, she looked like a desk with hair.

16:52.225 --> 16:53.611
What is going on in here?

16:54.965 --> 16:57.266
Are you shaving your office furniture?

16:58.015 --> 17:00.036
Well, it's not gonna shave itself.

17:00.435 --> 17:02.844
Ok, here's the deal. There was this experiment...

17:02.912 --> 17:05.210
Enough said. I know how those go.

17:05.244 --> 17:09.189
Last week I had that genetically altered koala flying around my office.

17:10.925 --> 17:12.425
While you're here...

17:15.105 --> 17:16.108
So...

17:16.125 --> 17:18.310
Thank you. How are things with your father?

17:18.345 --> 17:22.704
Well, we spent all yesterday together but it never felt right.

17:23.395 --> 17:26.960
Am I a horrible person?
Well, I don't know anything about fathers either.

17:26.994 --> 17:31.130
Chasing a relationship with mine could
turn the whole world into a giant fur ball.

17:31.165 --> 17:33.315
What my father and I had worked for us.

17:33.325 --> 17:35.495
Why am I trying to change it?

17:38.215 --> 17:39.223
Oh, and Ted ...

17:39.235 --> 17:40.640
stop torturing your desk.

17:40.675 --> 17:43.812
I got a Russian girl who can get that thing bikini ready in 20 minutes.

17:47.085 --> 17:51.381
A few days later, Phil and Lem figured
out a solution to the hair problem.

17:54.585 --> 17:58.292
Mr. Palmer had also been thinking about
his new relationship with Veronica.

17:58.505 --> 17:59.690
Huh, Mr. Palmer?

17:59.725 --> 18:02.175
I'm Linda, I'm a friend of your...

18:02.345 --> 18:05.153
well, not really a friend of your daughter.
More of a colleague. No...

18:05.245 --> 18:08.580
I'm definitely not a colleague.
We are not equals in any way.

18:08.615 --> 18:11.030
I guess if you force me to define the relationship...

18:11.065 --> 18:12.130
Young lady...

18:12.165 --> 18:14.890
are you awara that I have only one year to live?

18:14.925 --> 18:15.932
I'm sorry.

18:15.975 --> 18:19.740
I just wanted to say how great I think it is
that you and Veronica are finally connecting

18:19.775 --> 18:23.825
after all these years.
Thank you very much, that's very sweet.

18:24.595 --> 18:26.087
What are you doing for lunch?

18:26.805 --> 18:30.224
I... I thought that you and Veronica were going out.

18:30.575 --> 18:33.225
Oh, yeah, that's right. Of course. We are going out.

18:33.505 --> 18:34.906
That'll be fun.

18:35.195 --> 18:37.573
We've been having so much... fun.

18:37.975 --> 18:42.240
You know, every year my parents and I
rent a RV and go across the country.

18:42.275 --> 18:44.670
You should try it with Veronica sometime.

18:44.705 --> 18:49.355
Last year we saw the world's biggest
thermometer. It did not dispappoint.

18:49.735 --> 18:52.394
And we visited a town that has a dog for a mayor.

18:52.429 --> 18:54.811
He's the only mayor in Illinois that when you scratch its stomach

18:54.846 --> 18:57.122
he looks like he's trying to start a motorcycle.

18:57.525 --> 19:00.043
That's on the brochure. I think I have it here somewhere.

19:00.101 --> 19:03.260
Wow, such a lot going on in this country.

19:03.295 --> 19:06.204
No wonder America is trying to eat itself to death.

19:08.775 --> 19:09.825
Hey, dad.

19:09.975 --> 19:11.510
Are you ready to go to lunch?

19:11.545 --> 19:12.640
Yes, I thouht we could go...

19:12.675 --> 19:16.947
Veronica realised what kind of relationship
she wanted with her father.

19:17.205 --> 19:19.731
I just need to go down the hall a minute. I'll be right back.

19:19.807 --> 19:20.886
Ok.

19:36.635 --> 19:40.085
But left it up to him to decide what kind he wanted with her.

19:47.655 --> 19:52.065
And so they agreed to spend the remaining time together doing what they enjoyed most.

19:53.165 --> 19:56.400
Send them back, with a dozen smiley face cookies.

19:56.435 --> 19:59.420
He just ruined millions of dollars developing a hair product

19:59.455 --> 20:01.605
that's technically a parasite.

20:02.905 --> 20:06.680
And I realized that, rather than trying to change
something about my father that I couldn't

20:06.715 --> 20:10.270
I'd better to focus on being a better dad than my old man,

20:10.305 --> 20:13.255
and accept my kid for who she is and what she wants.

20:14.625 --> 20:15.625
Honey.

20:15.715 --> 20:18.588
You don't have to run for class president if you don't want to.

20:19.165 --> 20:20.165
Really?

20:20.385 --> 20:21.685
I can quit?

20:21.785 --> 20:23.385
To play in the mud?

20:24.025 --> 20:26.582
You are the best dad ever.

20:28.515 --> 20:31.310
Sure, I wanted Rose to become class president.

20:31.345 --> 20:33.700
But it's not something she wanted for herself.

20:33.735 --> 20:36.660
And come on! We all heard her campaign speech.

20:36.695 --> 20:39.635
And to whether my dad likes my gift or not...

20:45.015 --> 20:47.134
I'm really not gonna worry about it.

20:47.135 --> 20:50.135
