01:34.986 --> 01:37.158
<i>And then the hero, Wylie Burp,</i>

01:37.225 --> 01:39.876
<i>squinted across
the dusty street.</i>

01:39.946 --> 01:44.135
<i>Hopelessly surrounded by the Cactus Cat
gang, he stood his ground,</i>

01:44.200 --> 01:46.503
<i>refusing to back down.</i>

02:01.096 --> 02:04.445
Have no fear,
Billy the Kid is here.

02:04.521 --> 02:07.486
It's too tough, kid.
Get out while you can.

02:07.561 --> 02:11.073
If you're biting the dust,
I'm going down with ya.

02:30.374 --> 02:34.021
<i>You saved my life.
I'll never forget this, kid.</i>

02:34.088 --> 02:37.153
Here, son, I want you
to have one of these.

02:39.400 --> 02:41.471
Look out behind you.

02:41.543 --> 02:45.853
<i>Fievel, your supper's ready.</i>

02:45.928 --> 02:48.480
<i>Ready, ready, ready.</i>

02:51.398 --> 02:54.780
<i>Ouch!
Fievel!</i>

02:55.911 --> 02:58.976
<i>Fievel!</i>

02:59.046 --> 03:05.343
<i>#Somewhere out there #</i>

03:05.415 --> 03:10.019
# Beneath the
pale moonlight #

03:11.396 --> 03:16.668
# Someone's
thinking of me #

03:16.743 --> 03:20.387
#And loving me... #

03:20.455 --> 03:23.716
#And loving me... #

03:23.783 --> 03:27.643
<i>#And loving me... #
Shut up!</i>

03:27.718 --> 03:32.538
Papa, they're throwing fruit
and vegetables at me again.

03:32.613 --> 03:37.249
Keep singing. Maybe they will
throw some fruit for dessert.

03:39.397 --> 03:42.081
Another night
without cheese.

03:43.428 --> 03:45.915
Yee-haa!

03:45.988 --> 03:48.029
Howdy, Mama.

03:48.101 --> 03:50.588
I come to rustle
me up some grub.

03:50.659 --> 03:53.507
Where have you been,
Fievel? You're late.

03:53.573 --> 03:55.613
I had to rescue
Sheriff Wylie Burp.

03:55.686 --> 03:58.237
He was surrounded
by the Cactus Cat gang.

03:58.309 --> 04:01.092
Oh, such a
tall tale, Fievel.

04:01.157 --> 04:05.084
And dirty hands too?
Go. Wash.

04:05.155 --> 04:10.207
Oh, Mama, I just washed...
yesterday.

04:10.276 --> 04:14.071
I thought things would be
better in America.

04:14.146 --> 04:18.369
In Russia, my violins were
famous. We never went hungry.

04:18.435 --> 04:23.007
Maybe Tanya should sing again.
Very funny.

04:23.075 --> 04:27.582
You'll see.
Someday I'll be a big star.

04:27.651 --> 04:30.499
People will come
from miles around.

04:30.565 --> 04:33.411
Yeah, to eat.
Mama!

04:33.475 --> 04:35.330
Fievel...

04:47.778 --> 04:51.969
<i>They call America
the land of opportunity.</i>

04:52.035 --> 04:53.923
Opportunity
for what?

04:53.987 --> 04:58.109
For children to play in the filthy streets?
To never see the sunshine?

04:58.176 --> 05:02.301
Fievel's birthday
is coming...

05:02.370 --> 05:04.824
and we don't have
enough money for presents.

05:04.897 --> 05:07.069
Oh, Papa,
I don't care.

05:07.137 --> 05:10.400
I could sing in front
of the gift shop.

05:10.468 --> 05:14.776
Maybe they'll throw presents.

05:14.850 --> 05:18.624
How blessed I am to have
such fine children.

05:18.689 --> 05:22.714
<i>Maybe things will get better.</i>

05:22.785 --> 05:24.858
Tiger?
Tiger!

05:24.930 --> 05:28.093
Can we have an espresso
and talk this over?

05:28.161 --> 05:31.456
Listen, Tiger. You're an alley cat.
Pretty please.

05:31.520 --> 05:33.887
Born and bred.
How true.

05:33.953 --> 05:36.734
I got a ticket to sunshine
and I'm going west.

05:36.801 --> 05:40.062
There's a town that
promises a new frontier...

05:40.129 --> 05:42.135
and a brand-new
breed of cat.

05:42.208 --> 05:44.477
Is there anything
wrong with my breed?

05:44.544 --> 05:47.804
City cats got too much
purr in their fur.

05:47.872 --> 05:50.207
Not enough growl
in their howl.

05:50.273 --> 05:55.007
Look at you.
You catnap, cat around.

05:55.073 --> 05:57.788
Heck, I don't mean
to be mean,

05:57.857 --> 06:01.947
but you're even
a bit of a fraidy cat.

06:02.016 --> 06:04.087
Who told
you that?

06:04.158 --> 06:07.093
I'm no fraidy cat.
I'll show you.

06:07.167 --> 06:10.102
<i>I'll show them. I'm no fraidy cat.
Tiger.</i>

06:10.175 --> 06:12.990
I don't want a tomcat,
top cat or a tough tabby.

06:13.054 --> 06:16.951
I just want...
How do I say this?

06:17.023 --> 06:20.153
I just want a cat
who's more like a dog.

06:21.373 --> 06:25.171
<i>That's my ride out West.</i>

06:25.246 --> 06:29.370
Show me you're tough.
Don't make a fuss, okay?

06:31.839 --> 06:35.287
You don't mean...
this is good-bye?

06:35.360 --> 06:39.450
There are no good-byes
between you and me.

06:39.517 --> 06:42.517
After all, we'll always
have the Bronx.

06:42.589 --> 06:46.583
Here's looking
at you, kid.

06:49.085 --> 06:50.907
The Bronx,
that's right.

06:50.973 --> 06:53.428
The Bronx, right.
I won't make a fuss.

06:53.501 --> 06:57.331
I can handle it.
I can...

06:57.404 --> 07:00.698
I can, uh... I can, uh...

07:08.382 --> 07:14.585
Cat attack!

07:21.436 --> 07:24.633
Pay attention.
Keep it clean and tidy;

07:24.701 --> 07:27.221
plenty of violence,
but no eating.

07:27.293 --> 07:29.332
Right.
Carry on, chaps.

07:34.587 --> 07:37.238
<i>Fievel! Fievel!</i>

07:37.307 --> 07:40.211
Get in here
with the family!

07:47.005 --> 07:50.135
Oh, no! The mice!
Aw, gee!

07:52.218 --> 07:55.601
Peekaboo.

07:58.779 --> 08:02.522
Oh, I got...
I gotta do something.

08:02.588 --> 08:04.953
I will be tough.
I will be brave.

08:05.019 --> 08:09.622
<i>It's a spy... a spee... a spide... de...</i>

08:09.689 --> 08:12.985
de... de...
an arachnid!

08:13.051 --> 08:16.182
Aaah!

08:16.252 --> 08:20.180
Why, those no-good ornery varmints.
Fievel, my son.

08:20.250 --> 08:23.097
Come back!

08:23.162 --> 08:26.261
Oh!

08:26.329 --> 08:30.258
- Oh, thank heavens.
- I forgot my hat.

08:30.329 --> 08:34.607
<i>Fievel, come back.</i>

08:34.683 --> 08:36.688
<i>Hee-ya.
Fievel!</i>

08:36.763 --> 08:38.933
Fievel, my son,
come back!

08:47.577 --> 08:49.878
Da...
Da-da!

08:51.161 --> 08:53.334
Huh?

08:53.402 --> 08:56.402
<i>Heh-heh-heh!</i>

08:59.319 --> 09:02.453
<i>Hee-heh-heh!
I see you're missing an eye.</i>

09:02.521 --> 09:07.408
- This makes it a fair fight.
- Yeah?

09:07.480 --> 09:10.829
That's right.
I'm talking to you, fur head.

09:10.905 --> 09:13.075
Fur head?

09:13.144 --> 09:16.144
<i>I don't care what the boss says.</i>

09:16.216 --> 09:19.990
This mouse is lunch.
Heh-heh-heh- heh!

09:21.560 --> 09:23.665
Run! Run, Fievel!

09:24.695 --> 09:26.932
Oh, no.

09:34.903 --> 09:36.790
For your life, Fievel,
run!

09:49.143 --> 09:51.029
Mama, Tanya,
get in!

09:51.093 --> 09:52.981
Fievel!

09:57.846 --> 10:01.622
Papa,
get in!

10:10.292 --> 10:12.976
Everybody, together,
run!

10:13.781 --> 10:15.854
Run!

10:23.351 --> 10:26.646
<i>Jolly, jolly good.</i>

10:26.710 --> 10:28.849
Now for my part.

10:40.660 --> 10:43.081
Look!

11:15.218 --> 11:18.252
Aaah!

11:27.476 --> 11:31.949
- Let's go on that ride again.
- Where did I get such a son?

11:32.532 --> 11:35.628
<i>Why, howdy, fine mice.</i>

11:35.697 --> 11:39.693
<i>I'm in
desperate need ofhelp.</i>

11:39.763 --> 11:43.276
<i>I've come into possession
of railway tickets to the West.</i>

11:43.347 --> 11:46.958
<i>Tickets to sunshine
that I will be unable to use.</i>

11:47.027 --> 11:49.896
<i>Surely there are
some of y'all...</i>

11:49.971 --> 11:53.615
<i>looking for a little
elbow room, y'all.</i>

11:54.770 --> 11:59.406
Now, I ain't gonna lie.
There are problems out West.

11:59.472 --> 12:03.151
There's a lot of bright sunshine
and fresh air.

12:03.216 --> 12:07.789
<i>But after these opulent,
aromatic sewers, that might be...</i>

12:07.859 --> 12:11.436
upsetting for you all,

12:11.505 --> 12:13.740
you all, y'all,
sorry.

12:13.809 --> 12:17.290
I'll take one.
I'll take 15.

12:17.360 --> 12:21.584
Hold your horses
one minute, y'all.

12:21.649 --> 12:25.740
There's plenty for
everyone, yes, sirree.

12:25.808 --> 12:28.296
Are there
any cats out West?

12:28.369 --> 12:31.239
There certainly are.
If you have prejudices...

12:31.313 --> 12:34.445
against cats
you better stay put.

12:34.512 --> 12:38.189
On the frontier
cats and mice help each other.

12:38.256 --> 12:42.793
The anointed leader of cats,
Mr. Cat R. Waul,

12:42.862 --> 12:47.240
is the most enlightened,
intelligent, sophisticated,

12:47.312 --> 12:51.786
charming, non-narcissistic,
debonair, suave,

12:51.856 --> 12:54.671
dashing, renaissance cats
you could...

12:54.737 --> 12:58.151
<i>ever wish to meet.</i>

12:58.224 --> 13:00.363
Uh, ah, the fact is,

13:00.431 --> 13:03.846
cats even get along
with the dogs out there.

13:03.919 --> 13:06.820
<i>Sheriff Wylie Burp
is probably the finest...</i>

13:06.896 --> 13:09.710
<i>law-dog in the West,
actually, y'all.</i>

13:09.775 --> 13:13.158
Wylie Burp, wow!

13:13.231 --> 13:17.160
Too bad there aren't any desperadoes
left to round up. Hee- hee- hee!

13:17.232 --> 13:20.078
<i>- I'll take a ticket.
- Three tickets, please.</i>

13:20.141 --> 13:22.115
Don't push, please.
Plenty for all.

13:22.189 --> 13:25.256
<i>- Three tickets.
- Three for you, jolly good.</i>

13:25.327 --> 13:28.194
Come on, Papa.
Let's go.

13:28.271 --> 13:31.337
There is opportunity
out West.

13:31.407 --> 13:35.562
Maybe they have a better
appreciation of singers.

13:35.630 --> 13:38.281
So what are we fiddling
around here for?

13:39.055 --> 13:41.705
Let's go west!

13:41.774 --> 13:45.035
Jolly, jolly good.

13:45.102 --> 13:48.812
Anybody still like
some tickets, y'all?

14:03.405 --> 14:07.016
Oh, those nine lives
come in handy. Fiev.

14:07.085 --> 14:09.355
<i>Fievel.</i>

14:09.422 --> 14:13.250
Hello.
Wow, it's empty.

14:13.323 --> 14:16.195
Oh, no.
What's this?

14:17.550 --> 14:20.267
Oh, no!

14:22.156 --> 14:24.295
"Dear Tiger,
We left New York.

14:24.365 --> 14:27.679
<i>"We're taking the train to a town
out West called Green River.</i>

14:27.756 --> 14:31.782
"I tried to find you to tell you, but I
guess you were somewhere with Miss Kitty.

14:31.852 --> 14:34.667
"I miss you and I hope
I see you again sometime.

14:34.732 --> 14:36.968
Your best friend,
Fievel. "

14:39.852 --> 14:42.721
Train, the train!
They're taking the train.

14:52.557 --> 14:54.499
<i>Hurry, Mama.</i>

14:54.572 --> 14:57.158
The train won't wait.
I'm sure we forgot something.

14:57.227 --> 14:59.910
Let us see.
We have your violin tools,

14:59.981 --> 15:02.913
pots and pans,
your pipe,

15:02.985 --> 15:05.221
the tail curler,
whisker comb...

15:05.290 --> 15:07.812
and grandpa's
cheese knife.

15:07.881 --> 15:10.337
I hope we have everything.
Don't worry.

15:10.410 --> 15:13.126
<i>It will be wonderful.</i>

15:13.192 --> 15:16.260
<i>Alas, poor Yorick. I knew him well.</i>

15:16.330 --> 15:19.494
<i>Look, Mama,</i>

15:19.561 --> 15:21.700
an actor and a singer.

15:21.770 --> 15:25.731
Tanya, stop that. You shouldn't
stare at the less fortunate.

15:28.681 --> 15:32.513
Last call, all passengers
bound for Altuna,

15:32.586 --> 15:37.091
Akron, Elkhart,
Oskaloosa and Green River.

15:37.161 --> 15:40.227
Fievel,
what is wrong with you?

15:40.298 --> 15:42.817
You should be happy.
We are going west.

15:42.890 --> 15:46.435
I was hoping Tiger
would come say good- bye.

15:46.506 --> 15:50.759
Will I ever see him again, Papa?
Who am I to know?

15:50.825 --> 15:55.559
Tiger was a wonderful cat,
but he was still a cat.

15:55.623 --> 15:58.309
Someday you will understand.
When, Papa?

15:58.376 --> 16:00.833
When will I
understand?

16:00.906 --> 16:04.418
If growing up were easy,
would it take so long?

16:04.489 --> 16:07.236
Bye, Tiger,
wherever you are.

16:07.303 --> 16:11.582
You're the best cat
I ever met.

16:16.489 --> 16:18.877
<i>I gotta catch up with that train.</i>

16:18.953 --> 16:23.143
Fievel, wait for me.
Wait for me, please.

16:23.209 --> 16:27.169
Oh, dogs, I hate those guys.

16:46.119 --> 16:49.413
Oh, good.

16:49.479 --> 16:52.293
<i>Fievel's train hasn't left yet.</i>

16:52.360 --> 16:57.060
I want my mommy.

16:58.310 --> 17:01.627
Uh-oh.

17:03.526 --> 17:06.722
Grr!

17:14.885 --> 17:18.564
<i>Listen, you guys, be nice.</i>

17:21.732 --> 17:24.733
Oh!

17:25.829 --> 17:27.933
Ah-ha-ha!

17:28.006 --> 17:30.559
Oops!

17:31.877 --> 17:35.041
Cat got your tongue?

17:35.108 --> 17:36.962
Wait!
That's definitely...

17:37.028 --> 17:39.483
That's my train!
I want it.

17:42.149 --> 17:44.931
Ah-ha-ha!
Please, I'll be good.

17:44.996 --> 17:47.331
I'll always lick.
I'll always cover my...

17:53.956 --> 17:57.120
I made it.
What a stupid dog.

17:57.187 --> 18:00.449
Na-na-na-na-na-na. Your
mother was never housebroken.

18:00.516 --> 18:03.166
Ha-ha-ha-ha!
Toodle- oo!

18:05.474 --> 18:08.575
Hello.

18:18.274 --> 18:20.925
<i>Oh, no, not again.</i>

18:28.514 --> 18:32.476
Dogfish.

18:38.274 --> 18:41.373
Way out West, way out West,
way out West, way out West.

18:41.443 --> 18:43.865
Way out West, way out West.

18:43.938 --> 18:45.849
<i>Are we out West yet?</i>

18:45.924 --> 18:48.475
WestJersey,
maybe.

18:48.546 --> 18:51.067
# Life in New York City
it's full of dread and fuss #

18:51.138 --> 18:53.920
# Our dreams are waiting west
there's room for all of us #

18:53.986 --> 18:57.400
#The streets are paved nuggets
all of purest gold #

18:57.473 --> 19:01.052
# Soon we'll be millionaires... #
# Boy, have I been told #

19:02.498 --> 19:05.345
# No garbage and no landlord
foulin' up the air #

19:05.409 --> 19:08.671
# No crooks or politicians

19:08.736 --> 19:11.322
<i># We'll ride roaring rivers
Turn wilderness to towns #</i>

19:11.392 --> 19:14.525

19:17.697 --> 19:20.795
<i># There's wide open spaces

19:20.865 --> 19:23.613

19:23.681 --> 19:28.055
<i># We'll be everything

19:28.130 --> 19:31.327
#The nights are filled with

19:31.393 --> 19:33.946
# Days are filled with singing
Work is just like play #

19:34.016 --> 19:37.149
#We'll banjo, fiddle
We'll guitar, spoon #

19:37.217 --> 19:39.867
# Everywhere we go out there
we'll play this rousing tune #

19:39.936 --> 19:43.447

20:02.719 --> 20:06.429
#We'll do

20:06.496 --> 20:10.172
Way out West, way out West,
way out West, way out West.

20:25.884 --> 20:30.556
Ahh, shut up.

20:30.625 --> 20:32.990
Mother always wanted me
to be on the stage.

20:33.054 --> 20:35.836
Excuse me, sir.
Mr. Cowboy.

20:35.902 --> 20:38.837
You wouldn't be going
to Green River, would you?

21:29.084 --> 21:32.085
I know you.
You sold us the tickets.

21:32.156 --> 21:36.181
Hi, my name is Fievel Mousekewitz.

21:37.244 --> 21:39.383
<i>Heh-heh-heh-heh!</i>

21:39.452 --> 21:42.866
I win again, fathead.

21:42.938 --> 21:46.833
<i>I say you cheatin'.
You plays your last hand, Chula.</i>

21:46.907 --> 21:52.026
I don't think so.
I got seven more, dog chow.

21:52.091 --> 21:54.808
Why, you dirty, rotten,
low-down, double dealing...

21:54.875 --> 21:58.900
I don't get it, boss. How come
we're not munching those mice?

21:58.969 --> 22:04.056
<i>Oui. "Zees" fraternity "wiz" mice
does run counter to nature.</i>

22:04.122 --> 22:08.759
Which would you rather have,
the crouton or the salad?

22:08.827 --> 22:11.609
Of course
we will eat the mice,

22:11.675 --> 22:15.766
<i>but only after we have
exploited their labors.</i>

22:15.833 --> 22:18.386
<i>We are nice to the mice...</i>

22:18.458 --> 22:21.206
<i>because it is intelligent
to be so.</i>

22:21.274 --> 22:23.794
<i>If we talk sweetly,
they will come in droves.</i>

22:23.864 --> 22:28.372
If we hiss, they will run
and we will have to chase them,

22:28.442 --> 22:31.443
an unnecessary expenditure
of calories.

22:31.514 --> 22:34.993
So when do we take
the big bite, boss?

22:35.065 --> 22:37.139
When do we get to eat them?
When, when, when?

22:37.208 --> 22:40.079
When my empire at Green River
is complete...

22:40.155 --> 22:44.180
and when we have
a better mousetrap.

22:44.251 --> 22:46.038
Mouseburgers!
Mouseburgers!

22:46.106 --> 22:50.577
Yes, mouseburgers indeed.

22:50.647 --> 22:53.463
Music... to aid the digestion.
Help!

23:02.584 --> 23:05.431
Next stop: mouth,
throat, stomach,

23:05.495 --> 23:09.391
<i>intestine and, you guessed it,
Green River.</i>

23:11.319 --> 23:13.620
Whoa, oh!
Whoa, whoa, oh!

23:20.951 --> 23:23.157
Uh-oh.

23:25.240 --> 23:27.922
What do we
have here?

23:27.991 --> 23:31.220
It appears to be
a young pioneer.

23:31.287 --> 23:36.022
The feline in me would like
to devour this tender morsel,

23:36.087 --> 23:40.788
but the businessman
in me knows if I do,

23:40.854 --> 23:45.231
the other mice will miss
him and come looking.

23:45.303 --> 23:49.262
But the gourmet in me
quivers at the thought...

23:49.335 --> 23:53.939
of mouse tartar.

23:54.006 --> 23:58.741
But the entrepreneur prefers
not to be inundated...

23:58.807 --> 24:02.864
by suspicious mice that
could jeopardize my plan.

24:02.935 --> 24:05.104
So I must exercise...

24:05.175 --> 24:08.686
both willpower
and finesse.

24:08.757 --> 24:12.140
Scamper back to your
parents, little mouse.

24:12.214 --> 24:15.476
Do be careful.
It's hazardous out there.

24:15.542 --> 24:20.275
- Bye.
- Give him the flying "ahh. "

24:20.341 --> 24:25.043
- Make it good.
- I love the flying "ahh"!

24:36.020 --> 24:39.404
Mouse overboard!

24:39.477 --> 24:42.379
Where?
What?

24:42.453 --> 24:44.974
I just love
the flying "ahh. "

24:45.045 --> 24:48.045
- Ahh!
- Fievel!

24:50.644 --> 24:53.490
Fievel, my son.

24:53.556 --> 24:55.498
Don't be a fool,
Mousekewitz!

25:13.266 --> 25:16.464
<i>Excuse me. You got a minute?</i>

25:16.531 --> 25:19.281
Are there any
rest stops on this trip?

25:21.651 --> 25:26.157
Hey, wait for me.
You can't leave me here.

25:26.226 --> 25:29.359
I burn easily.
I'm...

25:29.427 --> 25:34.161
lost, all alone in
a million-acre cat box.

25:34.226 --> 25:36.265
Phoo!

25:54.514 --> 25:58.573
<i>My son, Fievel.</i>

26:03.505 --> 26:08.491
You know something?
I think we got snookered.

26:15.345 --> 26:20.527
No, Mama, this is what the land
of opportunity looks like... I think.

26:20.592 --> 26:23.114
It feels empty and lonely.

26:23.185 --> 26:26.959
Over here,
over here.

26:29.297 --> 26:31.883
Hey, you,
this is my place.

26:31.952 --> 26:34.670
This is my place.
Wanna buy it?

26:46.224 --> 26:50.763
<i>Papa, quick.
All right, we may be slower,</i>

26:50.830 --> 26:53.165
<i>but we are smarter.</i>

26:53.232 --> 26:56.874
<i>All these speedy mices
are fighting over the land.</i>

26:56.942 --> 27:00.969
In this dusty country you
want to be near the water.

27:09.264 --> 27:12.132
So this is what we
left New York for.

27:12.207 --> 27:16.397
This is what we
lost Fievel for.

27:19.823 --> 27:23.652
Chula, do this.
Chula, do that.

27:23.727 --> 27:26.955
I'm a good-looking
spider, no?

27:27.021 --> 27:31.365
There's lots of women
like to marry me.

27:31.438 --> 27:35.267
Mama, Fievel will come.
He's a Mousekewitz.

27:35.340 --> 27:39.497
If we work hard, Green River
will be everything we dreamed.

27:39.566 --> 27:41.671
<i>The water, for instance.</i>

27:41.742 --> 27:45.386
<i>In days it will be
a beautiful waterfall.</i>

27:45.452 --> 27:50.058
<i>That patch of mud will be
a rich field covered with grain.</i>

27:50.125 --> 27:54.697
<i>Prairie dogs will graze on that land,
and the city will prosper.</i>

28:00.269 --> 28:04.163
The water.
Without water...

28:04.237 --> 28:08.361
<i>how can we survive?</i>

28:10.219 --> 28:14.923
<i>Please, there's no need for such a
bleak assessment of your situation.</i>

28:14.989 --> 28:17.837
<i>After all,
what are neighbors for?</i>

28:17.900 --> 28:21.379
A cup of sugar,
a saucer of cream.

28:21.452 --> 28:23.940
A pail of water,
perhaps.

28:24.011 --> 28:26.728
Water? I'll give 'em water.

28:29.741 --> 28:31.650
I'd like to share
a vision.

28:31.724 --> 28:34.375
<i>A vision of a better world.
My eyes!</i>

28:34.445 --> 28:39.200
A world where cats and mice
live and work side by side.

28:39.276 --> 28:43.529
A world where mothers raise
their mouselings without fear.

28:43.595 --> 28:46.246
<i>Where musicians receive
their proper due.</i>

28:46.282 --> 28:49.578
<i>Where young mousettes
fulfill their every, dream.</i>

28:49.642 --> 28:54.377
Will you help me build this world?

28:56.202 --> 29:01.059
Water,
I need water.

29:01.130 --> 29:05.056
<i>Fievel.
I'm right here.</i>

29:05.130 --> 29:08.448
<i>Mama, I'm coming.</i>

29:08.522 --> 29:11.109
<i>Mama, I'm right here.
Fievel.</i>

29:11.179 --> 29:15.751
Mama, I'm coming.
Mama.

29:15.818 --> 29:18.884
<i>Fievel.</i>

29:20.809 --> 29:25.087
Fievel.

29:25.161 --> 29:28.357
Mama! Papa!
Mama.

29:30.280 --> 29:34.174
Yeo-o-o-o-ow!

29:36.490 --> 29:39.207
This is the worst
moment of my life.

29:39.274 --> 29:41.413
I wouldn't wish
this on a dog.

29:41.482 --> 29:43.937
Maybe a dog.

29:44.010 --> 29:47.304
# Oh, my darling
Oh, my darling #

29:47.369 --> 29:49.539
<i>Who?
# Oh, my darling... #</i>

29:49.608 --> 29:51.202
<i># Oh, my darling #
Who?</i>

29:51.273 --> 29:54.023
It's Tiger, your darling.
Don't you recognize me?

29:54.089 --> 29:57.089
- Who?
- It's me, Tiger.

29:57.160 --> 29:59.495
Your darling baby
buppie-bunga-boo.

30:04.295 --> 30:08.452
Hey, you're not
my darling.

30:08.519 --> 30:11.072
I just kissed
an owl.

30:11.143 --> 30:13.184
<i>Tiger!</i>

30:13.254 --> 30:16.736
- Fievel?
- Tiger!

30:16.809 --> 30:19.743
Fievel, I've been
searching all over for you.

30:19.816 --> 30:24.158
<i>Tiger, is that you?
Fievel.</i>

30:24.232 --> 30:27.427
Nope, bet it's
another mirage.

30:27.494 --> 30:30.179
Fievel, I can't
tell you how much...

30:30.249 --> 30:33.760
I wish you weren't
a mirage.

30:33.833 --> 30:37.955
Hi, mirage of Tiger.
Hi, mirage of Fievel.

30:48.805 --> 30:52.155
Don't they ever
dust this place?

30:52.230 --> 30:55.492
A guy could make
a fortune selling...

30:55.558 --> 30:58.111
vacuum cleaners.

31:11.015 --> 31:14.626
Dancing buffalo bones.
Naw.

31:27.781 --> 31:30.943
Come on, fellows.
I'm a mangy, old cat.

31:31.011 --> 31:33.947
I don't taste good
without ketchup.

31:34.019 --> 31:38.756
Ummm. No. No, ma'am.
I'm not your color.

31:38.820 --> 31:41.689
Could we have an espresso
and talk this over, please?

31:51.427 --> 31:54.623
How...
do you do?

32:00.932 --> 32:02.787
Huh?

32:11.682 --> 32:13.691
Ah.

32:20.195 --> 32:22.083
Hee-hee-hee.

33:37.087 --> 33:40.701
Mama!

33:40.768 --> 33:43.223
Papa!

33:55.903 --> 33:59.448
They think I'm their Tiger god.

33:59.518 --> 34:03.708
How lucky
can you get?

34:03.775 --> 34:07.550
I mean, how did they
know I was a vegetarian?

34:07.614 --> 34:11.094
Mm-mm-mm.

34:11.167 --> 34:13.556
It's funny how your appetite
perks up when you find out...

34:13.630 --> 34:17.273
that you're gonna eat dinner
instead of be dinner.

34:17.341 --> 34:20.659
Innkeeper,
more wine.

34:36.030 --> 34:37.371
Shhh!

34:37.406 --> 34:39.739
<i>I said put me down,
you ugly furball.</i>

34:39.804 --> 34:42.170
I won't stand for this.
Put me down.

35:04.251 --> 35:06.424
Uh-oh.

35:06.493 --> 35:09.176
Help!

35:12.796 --> 35:15.098
Water!

35:24.475 --> 35:27.542
Oh, no, I'm in a mouth.

35:30.684 --> 35:34.293
A little endive
went down the wrong tube.

35:34.362 --> 35:36.752
I hope he doesn't
throw up.

35:38.748 --> 35:41.464
- Get me out of here!
- Who said that?

35:41.532 --> 35:43.571
<i>Me.
Me, he says.</i>

35:43.644 --> 35:46.774
- Say "ah. "
- Ah.

35:46.843 --> 35:48.468
- Tiger!
- Fievel!

35:48.540 --> 35:52.564
I thought I'd never see you.
We waited for you at the station.

35:52.635 --> 35:55.634
Believe me,
I tried to get there,

35:55.706 --> 35:58.521
but I was dogged
every step of the way.

35:58.587 --> 36:01.750
Oh, Tiger,
you're my best friend.

36:01.819 --> 36:04.153
C'mon on, let's go
to Green River.

36:06.780 --> 36:10.258
There's something
I forgot to mention.

36:10.330 --> 36:12.849
The only reason I'm not
a moccasin right now...

36:12.922 --> 36:15.377
is because they think
I'm a god.

36:15.449 --> 36:19.444
This conversation is making
me look very ungodlike.

36:19.513 --> 36:22.865
Tiger, listen.
I have to warn my family.

36:22.938 --> 36:25.041
The cats are gonna turn
them into mouse... shh!

36:25.113 --> 36:29.750
These folks get offended
if you eat and run.

36:29.817 --> 36:32.403
I'll join you as soon as I can.
You promise?

36:32.472 --> 36:36.183
I promise.
Cross my heart and hope to cry.

36:36.250 --> 36:38.551
Oh, Tiger.
I almost forgot.

36:38.617 --> 36:42.578
How do you get to Green River?
Grab a passing sagecoach.

36:42.648 --> 36:45.464
See you later.
Adios.

36:45.528 --> 36:50.067
Sagecoach, get it?
Sage.

36:50.135 --> 36:52.025
Oh, never mind.

36:52.472 --> 37:00.949
<i>#Rollin', rollin'

Excuse me,
Mr. Dog.

37:28.056 --> 37:30.389
I was wondering if you
could give me some help.

37:34.007 --> 37:37.389
Oh, another tumbleweed
asking me for help.

37:37.463 --> 37:41.172
Oh, no, not again.

37:41.239 --> 37:44.436
Not again.

38:43.987 --> 38:45.896
Mama! Papa! Tanya!

38:45.973 --> 38:49.518
Our Fievel,
he's alive.

38:49.587 --> 38:54.225
Fievel, my baby.
He's come back to us.

38:54.292 --> 38:57.488
<i>Mousekewitz, don't let go!
Oh, Fievel.</i>

38:57.556 --> 39:01.297
What happened to you?
I got lost in this desert.

39:01.364 --> 39:05.105
This giant hawk picked me up
and dropped me...

39:05.258 --> 39:09.566
right on the Mousehican village
where Tiger is a god.

39:09.640 --> 39:12.771
Papa,
I have to warn you.

39:12.842 --> 39:16.385
The cats, they're gonna
build this giant mousetrap.

39:16.455 --> 39:19.074
They're gonna turn us
into mouseburgers!

39:19.143 --> 39:22.208
A giant mousetrap
and Tiger is a god?

39:22.279 --> 39:26.502
<i>Fievel's been out in the sun too long.
Mousekewitz!</i>

39:26.567 --> 39:30.790
But Tiger is a god and they
are building a giant mousetrap.

39:30.855 --> 39:34.912
Fievel, the only thing
that has grown...

39:34.981 --> 39:37.371
faster than you
are your tall tales.

39:37.445 --> 39:41.601
You will see that out West
cats are good.

39:57.026 --> 39:59.677
Huh?

40:11.009 --> 40:13.692
So, what's
your problem?

40:13.760 --> 40:17.591
Being nice to these mice.
It's driving me nuts!

40:17.664 --> 40:21.525
Get on with it,
you morons!

40:21.599 --> 40:24.151
After the saloon
is finished tomorrow,

40:24.223 --> 40:28.890
<i>we announce that we are going
to have a special ceremony.</i>

40:28.957 --> 40:32.372
We invite all
of the mice...

40:32.445 --> 40:35.893
"und" seat them
in the stands.

40:35.965 --> 40:40.602
<i>"Und" when the sun goes down...
Snappo!</i>

40:40.668 --> 40:43.386
<i>- Mouseburgers.
- Mouseburgers!</i>

40:43.451 --> 40:45.623
Let me hear that again.
Mouseburgers!

40:45.692 --> 40:48.374
Let the saliva flow!

40:48.443 --> 40:51.093
Mouseburgers!

40:51.164 --> 40:53.715
<i>#La la-la- la-la #</i>

40:53.786 --> 40:55.892
# La la-la-la-la #

40:55.962 --> 40:59.889
# La, la, la, la #
Next.

41:02.681 --> 41:07.414
Terrible, terrible.
Truly, utterly appalling.

41:07.480 --> 41:11.571
<i>I must have a voice to match
the opulence of this saloon.</i>

41:11.639 --> 41:13.875
Ooh!

41:16.055 --> 41:18.737
Pussy, pussy,
pussy, pussy.

41:18.805 --> 41:21.455
Pussy, pussy,
oh, pussy.

41:23.704 --> 41:28.437
Humans, yech!
So shiny and bleah!

41:28.502 --> 41:30.924
Right, I want
the subversive...

41:30.997 --> 41:33.898
who attempted to
assassinate me found.

41:33.972 --> 41:38.248
I love finding subversives.

41:38.324 --> 41:42.763
What's a subversive?
Someone who doesn't have long to live.

41:46.289 --> 41:50.218
If it isn't my friend
from the train.

41:50.289 --> 41:55.374
I heard what you said about mouseburgers.
I'm gonna tell everyone.

41:55.441 --> 41:59.498
I'm gonna get Wylie Burp
'cause he's the law. Wylie Burp?

42:01.489 --> 42:03.855
That quaint
historical figure.

42:03.919 --> 42:07.717
Put simply,
I am the law here.

42:07.792 --> 42:10.889
You're a mere
hors d'oeuvre.

42:11.758 --> 42:15.239
<i>#Dreams to dream #</i>

42:15.311 --> 42:19.467
<i>#In the dark of the night #
It's dinnertime.</i>

42:19.533 --> 42:22.053
<i># When the world goes wrong #</i>

42:22.126 --> 42:27.111
<i>What's wrong with the boss?
#I can still make it right #</i>

42:27.181 --> 42:31.435
<i>#I can see so far #</i>

42:31.501 --> 42:34.118
<i>#In my dreams #</i>

42:34.187 --> 42:38.692
<i>#I'll follow my dreams #</i>

42:38.763 --> 42:43.464
<i># Until they come true #</i>

42:45.353 --> 42:48.967
# Come with me #

42:49.035 --> 42:53.703
#You will see
what I mean #

42:53.770 --> 42:57.510
#There's a world inside #

42:57.577 --> 43:01.187
# No one else ever sees #

43:01.256 --> 43:04.102
#You will go #

43:04.166 --> 43:07.363
# So far in my dreams #

43:07.431 --> 43:12.251
# Somewhere in my dreams #

43:12.326 --> 43:16.798
#Your dreams
will come true #

43:19.430 --> 43:22.975
#There is a star #

43:23.044 --> 43:27.551
#Waiting to guide us #

43:27.621 --> 43:31.679
# Shining inside us #

43:31.749 --> 43:37.048
#When we close our eyes #

43:37.123 --> 43:40.384
# Don't let go #

43:40.451 --> 43:43.864
# If you stay close
to me #

43:43.937 --> 43:48.508
# In my dreams tonight #

43:48.576 --> 43:52.089
#You will see
what I see #

43:52.160 --> 43:55.543
# Dreams to dream #

43:55.615 --> 43:59.358
#As near as can be #

43:59.425 --> 44:01.756
# Inside you #

44:01.950 --> 44:03.806
#And me #
Well, well, well.

44:03.872 --> 44:06.293
#They always #
Look what the cat dragged in.

44:06.368 --> 44:09.212
# Come true #
A mouse, that's a first.

44:09.277 --> 44:12.572
Not just any mouse.
This is a diva.

44:12.638 --> 44:15.932
Diva, schmever.
Put a mouse on the stage...

44:15.996 --> 44:18.867
and your saloon's gonna be
as empty as Death Valley...

44:18.940 --> 44:21.939
<i>on a cold day in June
when the snow don't fall.</i>

44:22.011 --> 44:25.460
What?
They'll love her, adore her.

44:25.531 --> 44:27.439
Those who don't
will answer to me.

44:27.515 --> 44:30.580
Anything you say,
pussypoos.

44:30.652 --> 44:35.320
I have mentioned I dislike being
referred to as pussypoos.

44:35.386 --> 44:38.867
Yeah? I'm not so happy
about being dumped...

44:38.939 --> 44:43.128
in nature's ashtray 500 miles
from a pastrami sandwich.

44:43.194 --> 44:47.447
Pussypoos.
I just mentioned, didn't I,

44:47.511 --> 44:49.847
that I dislike being
referred to as pussypoos.

44:49.914 --> 44:53.043
As for the mousette, I'll
get her on the stage for ya.

44:53.112 --> 44:57.005
See that you do.
Farewell, my diva.

44:58.326 --> 45:02.288
Now then...

45:02.359 --> 45:05.587
<i>Don't worry, mousey.
You're safe now.</i>

45:05.653 --> 45:09.909
So you're really not tough
and mean like you were acting?

45:09.973 --> 45:12.624
Who, me?
Naw.

45:12.692 --> 45:16.075
I'm soft as this powder puff
and twice as gentle.

45:16.149 --> 45:20.753
But living out here around
characters like that...

45:20.821 --> 45:23.340
What's your name,
honey?

45:23.413 --> 45:26.160
Tanya.
Tanya Mousekewitz.

45:26.227 --> 45:28.464
And you want to be
a great singer.

45:28.530 --> 45:32.720
Oh, yes, yes,
yes, yes, yes.

45:34.322 --> 45:38.663
<i>What's the matter?
You're shaking like a rattlesnake tail.</i>

45:38.736 --> 45:43.275
I'm scared. I've never sang
in front of a real audience.

45:46.192 --> 45:48.745
<i>Sweetie, you wouldn't
be an artiste...</i>

45:48.817 --> 45:51.661
if you weren't
nervous.

45:51.726 --> 45:54.542
I'm not pretty.
Says who?

45:54.606 --> 45:58.468
You can be whatever you want
if you believe in yourself.

45:58.542 --> 46:01.576
<i>Show me some grit and guts.
Come on, honey.</i>

46:01.647 --> 46:06.315
<i>Give me a smile.
Oh, no, no.</i>

46:06.381 --> 46:09.250
Sweetheart, you can
do better than that.

46:09.327 --> 46:13.864
Think of something
real nice.

46:17.676 --> 46:20.042
I want you to reach
deep down...

46:20.107 --> 46:24.329
and find the most beautiful
thought that's in your heart.

46:28.714 --> 46:32.510
<i>Oh, beautiful.
Um.</i>

46:32.585 --> 46:34.374
<i>Tonight, Tanya,</i>

46:34.442 --> 46:39.014
forget you're in this cowpie
hole-of- an-olive-pit town.

46:39.082 --> 46:42.726
You're with your fella
at the El Purrocco club.

46:42.792 --> 46:45.987
<i>You're on that stage,
and he has a front row seat.</i>

46:46.056 --> 46:48.839
<i>You're singing your heart out
just for him.</i>

46:51.142 --> 46:54.972
There are things there
I miss so much.

46:55.046 --> 46:58.559
I've forgotten why I left.

46:58.629 --> 47:01.247
So much for regrets.

47:01.318 --> 47:05.724
- So, do you like yourself?
- I look like a real lady.

47:05.798 --> 47:10.051
Remember, the real lady
is what's under the mask.

47:10.115 --> 47:12.668
Now go
knock 'em dead.

47:17.795 --> 47:21.624
<i>Oh, dear, oh, dear.
He's not cookin'evenly.</i>

47:24.898 --> 47:26.143
Yeow!

47:26.179 --> 47:28.566
<i>Gentle creatures, I have arranged...</i>

47:28.608 --> 47:34.304
for a special preview
of the artistic virtuosity...

47:34.369 --> 47:38.263
that will become of
commonplace on this stage.

47:38.337 --> 47:42.164
Allow me to present
the divine diva,

47:42.240 --> 47:44.607
Miss Tanya!

47:51.615 --> 47:56.348
- I can't do this.
- Sure you can.

47:56.414 --> 47:58.585
If anyone throws so much
as a radish at you,

47:58.654 --> 48:01.109
<i>I'll slap 'em so hard
their meow'll fall off.</i>

48:04.252 --> 48:06.904
Huh?
Oh.

48:09.564 --> 48:13.524
A mouse!
Throw the mouse out of the house!

48:13.595 --> 48:16.344
<i># Do you ever miss... #</i>

48:16.378 --> 48:20.950
<i>The boss has hit the catnip again.
What's wrong with the boss?</i>

48:21.016 --> 48:24.629
# Do you ever
miss the girl #

48:24.697 --> 48:31.767
<i># You left behind #</i>

48:35.065 --> 48:37.879
Gosh!
Gosh!

48:37.944 --> 48:39.602
Gosh!

48:39.671 --> 48:42.573
# Is the girl you left behind
out there tonight romancin' #

48:42.646 --> 48:45.963
# Makin' eyes at someone else and singin'
Is she dancin' #

48:46.040 --> 48:49.071
<i>Come back mouse!
You wouldn't want me to miss dinner!</i>

48:49.141 --> 48:52.127
# Puts teardrops in your eyes
from secrets she is keepin' #

48:52.128 --> 48:52.849
I'm blind!

48:52.917 --> 48:53.629
Help, Tanya!

48:53.630 --> 48:57.008
# Have the fiddlers play a
tune and dance the night away #

48:57.076 --> 48:59.410
I'm not here,
you pointed head.

48:59.477 --> 49:01.898
<i># You know you'll always
miss her #</i>

49:01.972 --> 49:06.281
<i># Lonely is the lover's heart if only you
could kiss her kiss her, kiss her #</i>

49:09.236 --> 49:12.333
Come here!
Come here! Aah!

49:12.402 --> 49:14.607
<i>Durn mouse!</i>

49:14.674 --> 49:16.814
Bugger face!

49:16.883 --> 49:20.459
#Just don't leave 'em too darn long,
I think I oughta warn ya #

49:20.529 --> 49:23.628
#Absence makes the heart grow cold
and makes a heart to wander #

49:23.697 --> 49:26.991
# If you stay by their side
you'll feel their hearts grow fonder #

49:27.057 --> 49:30.187
# Hope you see her someday
Hope I find my way #

49:30.255 --> 49:33.353
# Back to the girl
I left behind #

49:33.424 --> 49:36.739
#Tell me you will never roam #
#We swear we won't go roamin' #

49:36.815 --> 49:39.881
#You'll be by your fireside #
#We'll all be home sweet homin' #

49:39.952 --> 49:41.894
# Kiss her
miss her, kiss her #

49:41.967 --> 49:46.373
# Inky-dinky spider
caught a mouse in his web #

49:46.445 --> 49:50.918
#The inky-dinky spider
bit off the mouse's head #

49:50.989 --> 49:54.818
Hee-hee-hee!
Ow! I'm in pain!

49:54.893 --> 49:58.339
#Where's the girl you left behind #
# She's waitin' for her sister #

49:58.412 --> 50:01.281
#We won't stop until we're home
We'll hug and kiss her #

50:01.356 --> 50:06.089
# I'll find the girl
I'll find the girl #

50:06.156 --> 50:09.057
# I'll find the girl
I'll find the girl I left behind #

50:09.130 --> 50:12.675
#Tonight, tonight, tonight
That's right, all right #

50:15.529 --> 50:19.107
<i>Encore, encore!</i>

50:26.761 --> 50:29.313
Tanya, let's
get out of here.

50:29.383 --> 50:32.482
I must stay.
My public needs me.

50:32.552 --> 50:35.333
I can't leave you.
It's dangerous.

50:35.399 --> 50:38.747
"Thank you for your...

50:38.821 --> 50:42.302
a- du-lation. "

50:42.375 --> 50:44.228
Tanya.

50:54.532 --> 50:58.590
<i>What's the matter, son?</i>

50:58.659 --> 51:03.230
Did you ever know something
important but nobody will believe ya?

51:03.299 --> 51:05.884
Boy, I wish
Wylie Burp was here.

51:05.955 --> 51:07.841
You do?

51:18.720 --> 51:21.980
Well, then,
he... he... he's right here.

51:22.049 --> 51:25.048
<i>Where?
The old dog's right under your whiskers.</i>

51:35.069 --> 51:37.753
<i>Read the badge, son.</i>

51:43.100 --> 51:47.475
"Wylie Burp, Sheriff. "
Wow!

51:49.917 --> 51:51.826
We need you, Sheriff Burp.

51:51.900 --> 51:56.950
The cats are gonna turn us into
mouseburgers. You gotta help us now!

51:57.018 --> 52:00.215
Let this
sleepin' dog lie, son.

52:00.283 --> 52:04.723
Doggone it, I'm dog tired. I'm
tired of leadin' a dog's life...

52:04.793 --> 52:08.141
and fighting like cats and dogs
against cats and dogs,

52:08.217 --> 52:12.626
and young pups doggin'
my trail trying to become top dog.

52:12.696 --> 52:17.551
I'm goin' to the dogs
in a dog-eat-dog world, son.

52:17.624 --> 52:20.820
I'm so far over the hill,

52:20.887 --> 52:24.782
I'm on the bottom
of the other side.

52:39.126 --> 52:40.718
<i>But you know,</i>

52:40.757 --> 52:43.603
I think I might
be able to help ya.

52:43.669 --> 52:47.528
How? We've only got
'til sundown tomorrow.

52:47.602 --> 52:52.272
Gotta find me a dog.
I'll teach him the stuff.

52:52.338 --> 52:55.567
I'll make a hero
out of him.

52:58.547 --> 53:01.130
I don't know
any dogs...

53:01.202 --> 53:03.340
but I do know
a god!

53:03.410 --> 53:06.724
Oh, no, I can't.
You got the wrong cat.

53:06.800 --> 53:11.208
I am a god of eternal peace
and cosmic love, my friend.

53:11.281 --> 53:12.970
But why argue?
I'm here, you're here.

53:13.008 --> 53:16.107
<i>We're all here.
But we're going to Green River.</i>

53:16.176 --> 53:18.958
You're going to Green River.
I'm gonna stay right here.

53:18.990 --> 53:23.334
So, you know, give my
regards to everybody.

53:26.830 --> 53:28.935
Too bad...

53:29.007 --> 53:33.795
because there's a very, very
pretty cat there you might remember.

53:33.869 --> 53:37.283
My darling baby
bubby-bunka- boo.

53:38.029 --> 53:42.086
Oh.

53:42.156 --> 53:45.187
You convinced me!
What do I gotta do?

53:45.259 --> 53:49.056
Ah, it ain't nothin' much.
You just gotta pretend to be a dog!

53:49.131 --> 53:51.584
A dog!
You got it.

53:51.658 --> 53:54.145
A dog!
Tiger...

53:54.217 --> 53:58.951
anyone can be a god, but...
it takes grit to be a dog!

54:01.250 --> 54:04.566
So you're the frivolous feline
I've got to whip into shape?

54:04.642 --> 54:07.132
I've got my work
cut out for me.

54:07.204 --> 54:11.548
I don't have to listen to this.
I... am a god!

54:11.622 --> 54:13.531
Yeah?
Yeah!

54:13.606 --> 54:16.924
- Yeah? Yeah?
- Yeah! Yeah!

54:16.999 --> 54:20.099
I don't have to listen
to this. I'm a god!

54:21.226 --> 54:23.136
Fetch, dog.

54:25.451 --> 54:27.491
Moi?

54:27.564 --> 54:29.158
Aah!

54:36.591 --> 54:38.314
Hmm.

54:39.664 --> 54:41.574
No, no.
All wrong.

54:41.648 --> 54:45.030
What did I do wrong?
You want me to dribble all over it?

54:46.417 --> 54:49.287
You wanna act like a dog,
you gotta think like a dog...

54:49.361 --> 54:51.272
'til you smell
like a dog.

54:51.348 --> 54:54.066
No self-respecting dog
fetches anything,

54:54.134 --> 54:55.921
unless he's good
and feels like it.

54:55.988 --> 55:00.214
You wanna intimidate someone,
give 'em the la-a-zy eye.

55:00.279 --> 55:05.266
Gee, I'm afraid to ask.
Okay, what's the la- a-zy eye?

55:05.336 --> 55:08.916
The la-a-zy eye!
Wah!

55:08.984 --> 55:10.295
Woof.

55:10.362 --> 55:13.233
Now you do it.

55:21.534 --> 55:23.443
Hopeless.

55:29.153 --> 55:32.896
Now, lemme
see you walk.

55:34.658 --> 55:37.562
You're wiggling
like a French poodle.

55:37.635 --> 55:41.827
Get down on all fours and get
a snoot full of mother earth.

55:41.893 --> 55:45.311
Yuck! That goes
against my grain.

55:45.384 --> 55:48.099
Yech!
Roll, you varmint. Roll.

55:48.167 --> 55:51.202
Give yourself
a dirt bath.

55:51.273 --> 55:54.502
Now you're gettin' it.
C'mon. We're rootin' for ya.

55:54.570 --> 55:58.661
Get up. Suck in
your paunch, boy.

56:00.299 --> 56:04.043
Saunter on out there,
one leg in front of the other,

56:04.109 --> 56:06.379
slow and easy.

56:08.014 --> 56:11.910
Woosh!

56:13.424 --> 56:15.430
I hurt myself.

56:15.505 --> 56:19.435
If you're gonna act like a dog,
you gotta sound like a dog.

56:19.508 --> 56:21.394
Let's hear you bark.

56:24.181 --> 56:25.708
Well, go ahead.

56:25.781 --> 56:28.302
Bow-wow.

56:28.374 --> 56:31.636
Bow-wow?
It's more like... bark!

56:31.703 --> 56:33.131
Bark.

56:33.207 --> 56:34.702
<i>No, again.</i>

56:34.776 --> 56:36.270
<i>Woof.
Again.</i>

56:36.346 --> 56:40.753
Woof! Rawf!
Raft! Racket!

56:40.825 --> 56:43.215
Rap! Rapscallion!
Rumpelstiltskin!

56:43.290 --> 56:47.186
<i>Redincta gracio, amore!</i>

56:47.260 --> 56:49.879
Oh, this is
embarrassing.

56:49.949 --> 56:51.838
Try growling.

56:51.903 --> 56:55.383
Grr!
Grr-rrr.

57:06.434 --> 57:10.331
<i>C'mon, Tiger.
We're running out of time.</i>

57:11.749 --> 57:14.652
Now...

57:14.727 --> 57:16.897
<i>Bark!</i>

57:18.791 --> 57:21.923
Woof, woof!

57:21.992 --> 57:24.414
<i>Woof, woof!</i>

57:24.489 --> 57:28.321
Bow-wow-wow-wow-wow.
Ha-ha-ha- ha.

57:28.394 --> 57:30.251
Woof-woof-woof!
Grr!

57:30.316 --> 57:33.065
<i>Grr! Bark, bark!
Bow-wow!</i>

57:33.130 --> 57:34.989
<i>Bark-bark,
bark-bark-bark.</i>

57:35.053 --> 57:38.828
Woof-woof-woof.
Bark-bark-bark.

57:38.894 --> 57:44.111
Bark-bark-bark.
Woof-woof-woof.

58:35.170 --> 58:37.026
Woof!

58:44.035 --> 58:45.980
Ten-hut!

59:09.998 --> 59:11.909
Grr.

59:25.363 --> 59:29.140
Who?

59:38.168 --> 59:41.943
<i>Jolly good. Now pay attention.</i>

59:42.008 --> 59:44.017
Cats and gentle mice,

59:44.058 --> 59:47.540
lend me your ears.

59:47.579 --> 59:51.923
<i>It is my distinguished pleasure
to invite all of you...</i>

59:51.965 --> 59:55.347
to share our
dinner... triumph!

59:55.421 --> 59:58.423
To share our triumph!

59:58.494 --> 01:00:02.271
Today we herald in
a momentous...

01:00:02.336 --> 01:00:04.989
new feast... ival.

01:00:05.057 --> 01:00:07.426
"Feastival... " festival.

01:00:07.490 --> 01:00:12.227
To mark this brilliant and
illustrious snack occasion,

01:00:12.293 --> 01:00:15.676
I will, with these
golden scissors,

01:00:15.751 --> 01:00:20.192
hereby cut the
red... ribbon.

01:00:23.591 --> 01:00:25.480
Bravo!

01:00:36.267 --> 01:00:39.914
Cat R. Waul, we've come
to close you down.

01:00:39.980 --> 01:00:42.951
Okay, chaps, it's become
necessary to put these dogs...

01:00:43.023 --> 01:00:44.878
through obedience school.

01:00:44.943 --> 01:00:46.634
Kill.

01:00:49.103 --> 01:00:51.757
Oh, look out
behind you, kid.

01:00:51.827 --> 01:00:54.674
Aaah!

01:01:07.862 --> 01:01:12.337
Oh, who's that dog down there with Wylie?
He's got some stuff!

01:01:19.739 --> 01:01:21.530
Hee-hee-hee-hee!

01:01:36.160 --> 01:01:37.985
Ha-ha.

01:01:41.282 --> 01:01:43.105
That's Fievel?

01:01:47.685 --> 01:01:50.915
It's too tough, kid.
Get out while you still can.

01:01:50.981 --> 01:01:53.402
Okay. Toodle-oo.
Hey, Tiger.

01:01:53.478 --> 01:01:57.376
Give 'em
the la- a-zy eye!

01:02:02.794 --> 01:02:04.934
Run for your lives!

01:02:07.532 --> 01:02:09.867
Morons.
Trigger the mousetrap!

01:02:09.934 --> 01:02:13.895
It's a giant mousetrap!

01:02:13.967 --> 01:02:17.829
It's a giant mousetrap!
They're gonna squash the mice!

01:02:17.903 --> 01:02:21.103
<i>Now!
# Oh, say, can you see #</i>

01:02:21.171 --> 01:02:24.105
<i>- # You're on a mousetrap #
- Stop!</i>

01:02:24.146 --> 01:02:27.112
<i>You'll crush the diva!
Flee! Run, run.</i>

01:02:27.187 --> 01:02:29.906
<i>Run, every, body.
Run for your lives!</i>

01:02:29.972 --> 01:02:33.835
Freeze,
you miserable vermin!

01:02:37.238 --> 01:02:38.963
Run for your lives!

01:02:47.835 --> 01:02:50.170
- Yee-haw!
- Aah! Aah!

01:02:50.234 --> 01:02:52.472
Now you freeze,
cat R. Waul.

01:02:52.508 --> 01:02:55.858
<i>Don't pull it, kid, or you've
seen the last of Miss Kitty.</i>

01:02:55.933 --> 01:02:57.722
Get your
hands off me!

01:02:57.790 --> 01:03:00.858
<i>Grr... owl!
Help! Help!</i>

01:03:13.891 --> 01:03:17.055
- Take that!
- Oh, ho-ho-ho!

01:03:17.124 --> 01:03:19.198
I never taught him
that one.

01:03:31.690 --> 01:03:34.539
You harm one patch of fur
on her and I'll tear you apart,

01:03:35.499 --> 01:03:37.834
one leg at a time.

01:03:41.165 --> 01:03:42.376
Aaah!

01:03:42.445 --> 01:03:44.748
Ooo.
Okay, Wylie.

01:03:44.813 --> 01:03:47.946
- Let 'em rip, kid.
- Yes, sir, Mr. Burp, sir.

01:04:03.316 --> 01:04:05.228
And now...

01:04:08.695 --> 01:04:12.755
revenge!

01:04:12.825 --> 01:04:16.021
<i>Oh, pussypoos! Oh, no!</i>

01:04:16.089 --> 01:04:19.189
Come to Mommy,
darling.

01:04:19.259 --> 01:04:23.961
Mommy's going to take care
of you for ever and ever... and ever!

01:04:42.562 --> 01:04:46.208
Papa, Mama!
Fievel, my baby!

01:04:46.275 --> 01:04:50.171
Ha-ha! Our Fievel
is not so little anymore.

01:04:50.245 --> 01:04:53.115
And a regular
Western hero.

01:05:04.139 --> 01:05:07.849
Now it's time for music.
Let's celebrate!

01:05:21.393 --> 01:05:24.011
Tiger!

01:05:24.080 --> 01:05:29.299
<i>Oh, Tiger.
I never taught him that one.</i>

01:05:32.852 --> 01:05:35.375
Wylie.

01:05:49.561 --> 01:05:51.951
Here, son.
I want you to have one of these.

01:05:52.027 --> 01:05:56.152
I can't. I'm not
a hero like you...

01:05:56.221 --> 01:06:00.281
well, not really.
Well, maybe not.

01:06:00.350 --> 01:06:04.094
Maybe a real hero's the
last one to hear about it.

01:06:04.159 --> 01:06:06.364
But you pulled me out
of a gutter...

01:06:06.431 --> 01:06:08.800
and for that
I owe you some thanks.

01:06:08.864 --> 01:06:11.452
Just remember, Fievel,

01:06:11.521 --> 01:06:14.785
one man's sunset is
another man's dawn.

01:06:14.852 --> 01:06:18.235
<i>I don't know
what's out there...</i>

01:06:18.308 --> 01:06:20.927
<i>beyond those hills,</i>

01:06:20.996 --> 01:06:23.268
but if you ride yonder,

01:06:23.302 --> 01:06:26.782
head up, eyes steady,
heart open,

01:06:26.855 --> 01:06:28.480
I think one day
you'll find...

01:06:28.520 --> 01:06:33.157
<i>that you're the hero
you've been lookin'for.</i>

01:07:53.221 --> 01:07:56.092
<i>#I lose my way #</i>

01:07:56.166 --> 01:07:58.653
<i>#No one cares #</i>

01:07:58.728 --> 01:08:01.597
<i># The words I say #</i>

01:08:01.671 --> 01:08:04.062
<i>#No one hears #</i>

01:08:04.138 --> 01:08:07.238
<i>#My life it seems #</i>

01:08:07.307 --> 01:08:12.164
<i>#Is a world of dreams #</i>

01:08:14.796 --> 01:08:17.481
<i>#Deep in the night #</i>

01:08:17.549 --> 01:08:20.135
<i># You'll find me #</i>

01:08:20.206 --> 01:08:23.055
<i>#Dream, and you're right #</i>

01:08:23.120 --> 01:08:25.904
<i>#Behind me #</i>

01:08:25.968 --> 01:08:28.751
<i>#Stay #</i>

01:08:28.817 --> 01:08:33.291
<i>#If you will stay #</i>

01:08:36.435 --> 01:08:45.965
<i># We'll dream
the night away #</i>

01:08:46.040 --> 01:08:49.652
<i>#Dreams to dream #</i>

01:08:49.720 --> 01:08:54.612
<i>#In the dark of the night #</i>

01:08:54.683 --> 01:08:58.908
<i># When the world
goes wrong #</i>

01:08:58.973 --> 01:09:03.251
<i>#I can still
make it right #</i>

01:09:03.327 --> 01:09:10.683
<i>#I can see so far
in my dreams #</i>

01:09:10.752 --> 01:09:15.390
<i>#I'll follow my dreams #</i>

01:09:15.457 --> 01:09:23.197
<i># Until they come true #</i>

01:09:25.287 --> 01:09:29.795
<i># There is a star #</i>

01:09:29.863 --> 01:09:34.720
<i># Waiting to guide us #</i>

01:09:34.792 --> 01:09:38.984
<i>#Shining inside us #</i>

01:09:39.050 --> 01:09:45.993
<i># When we close our eyes #</i>

01:09:46.060 --> 01:09:48.549
<i># Come with me #</i>

01:09:48.621 --> 01:09:53.260
<i># You will see
what I mean #</i>

01:09:53.326 --> 01:09:57.737
<i># There's a world inside #</i>

01:09:57.810 --> 01:10:02.285
<i>#No one else ever sees #</i>

01:10:02.355 --> 01:10:07.178
<i># You will go so far #</i>

01:10:07.251 --> 01:10:09.491
<i>#In my dreams #</i>

01:10:09.557 --> 01:10:14.195
<i>#Somewhere in my dreams #</i>

01:10:14.261 --> 01:10:21.815
<i># Your dreams will come true #</i>

01:10:41.344 --> 01:10:45.120
<i>#Don't let go #</i>

01:10:45.185 --> 01:10:49.792
<i>#If you stay close to me #</i>

01:10:49.860 --> 01:10:54.465
<i>#In my dreams tonight #</i>

01:10:54.531 --> 01:10:58.624
<i># You will see
what I see #</i>

01:10:58.693 --> 01:11:01.543
<i>#Dreams to dream #</i>

01:11:01.608 --> 01:11:06.180
<i>#As near as can be #</i>

01:11:06.249 --> 01:11:10.723
<i>#Inside you and me #</i>

01:11:10.794 --> 01:11:18.282
<i># They always come #</i>

01:11:18.349 --> 01:11:20.073
<i># True #</i>

01:11:20.143 --> 01:11:24.649
<i>#Inside you and me #</i>

01:11:24.718 --> 01:11:32.175
<i># They always come #</i>

01:11:32.242 --> 01:11:41.739
<i># True #</i>
