WEBVTT

00:47.520 --> 00:49.499
(Birdsong)

00:50.720 --> 00:52.699
(Church bell rings)

01:03.040 --> 01:05.907
To bury her in a pauper's grave
with no headstone!

01:06.080 --> 01:08.059
She will have a headstone.

01:09.320 --> 01:11.823
She was the last of the Trenwith Poldarks...

01:14.920 --> 01:16.865
...barring Geoffrey Charles.

01:23.400 --> 01:25.379
(Bells jingling)

01:32.360 --> 01:33.827
What is my of fence, George?

01:34.000 --> 01:37.777
Since Aunt Agatha's death,
there's scarce been two words between us.

01:37.960 --> 01:41.544
Of course I was unhappy that she was buried
in haste without due ceremony.

01:41.720 --> 01:45.349
We do not know what she died _of. _
My concern was solely about possrble Infection.

01:45.520 --> 01:48.705
And perhaps I was wrong
in challenging you so vigorously.

01:48.880 --> 01:51.860
But why should your displeasure
extend to Valentine?

01:52.040 --> 01:54.179
You've barely looked at him for weeks.

01:55.720 --> 02:00.942
I've been occupied with other matters
and expect it to be so till after the election.

02:01.720 --> 02:03.039
And then?

02:04.440 --> 02:06.419
I will go to London.

02:32.480 --> 02:34.857
Will you take tea?

02:35.040 --> 02:39.579
I thank you, ma'am. This is not a...social call.

02:41.280 --> 02:42.383
Ah.

02:53.520 --> 02:55.545
(George clears throat)

02:57.080 --> 03:01.949
I have...called on a personal matter.

03:02.800 --> 03:06.224
Therefore what I have to say
must be utterly confidential.

03:06.400 --> 03:08.584
Everything between doctor
and patient is confidential.

03:08.760 --> 03:12.218
Yes. But this pertains not to me, but to my son.

03:12.400 --> 03:15.107
- Valentine.
- Yes?

03:18.320 --> 03:22.507
He was...an eight-month child, correct?

03:22.680 --> 03:24.307
Born premature because of my wife's fall.

03:24.480 --> 03:28.382
And from what I could tell, suffered no ill effects
for coming a month early.

03:30.000 --> 03:31.467
I believe...

03:35.120 --> 03:37.145
lam told...

03:37.960 --> 03:41.509
that an eight-month child has no nails.

03:41.680 --> 03:43.500
Not necessarily the case.

03:43.680 --> 03:45.500
- Or hair.
- It's usually sparse.

03:45.680 --> 03:49.104
- And that the skin is wrinkled.
- So is that of many at full term.

03:49.280 --> 03:53.228
My son, if you recollect, had nails,
smooth skin, and a goodly head of hair.

03:59.320 --> 04:02.904
I observed nothing at the time of his birth

04:03.080 --> 04:07.505
which might lead me to speculate that
anything...was not as it should be.

04:07.680 --> 04:09.898
- In other words, you will not tell me.
- In other words,

04:10.080 --> 04:13.902
I cannot categorically say one way or another.
Were I able, I would do so.

04:18.480 --> 04:21.381
I would remind you, you are pledged to secrecy.

04:22.440 --> 04:24.749
And I would remind you
that I am a gentleman, sir,

04:24.920 --> 04:27.229
as well as a doctor.

04:36.880 --> 04:38.905
(Coughing)

04:50.880 --> 04:54.259
- Warleggan's cut wages at three of their mines.
- Again?

04:54.440 --> 04:58.661
Twelve mile these have walked
on the off-chance of work.

04:59.800 --> 05:02.018
Shall I send them away?

05:04.360 --> 05:07.739
OSSIE:
The spirit is willing but the flesh is weak.

05:07.920 --> 05:12.300
Watch and pray that ye enter not
into temptation.

05:12.480 --> 05:14.380
Put on the armour of God,

05:14.560 --> 05:17.540
that ye may be able to withstand
the wiles of the devil.

05:22.480 --> 05:25.779
Strait is the gate and narrow is the way

05:25.960 --> 05:28.986
which leads to virtue and purity...

05:49.040 --> 05:51.417
My clear, what an age it's been.

05:51.600 --> 05:53.465
You and George must dine with us.

05:53.640 --> 05:56.507
I would have asked him today
but he left in such haste.

05:56.680 --> 05:58.386
George has been to visit?

05:58.560 --> 06:00.983
Oh, not me. My husband.

06:01.160 --> 06:02.821
A social call?

06:03.000 --> 06:06.060
- A private matter.
- Concerning?

06:06.240 --> 06:08.800
You know Dwight. Never discusses his patients.

07:04.840 --> 07:05.909
(Knocking)

07:06.080 --> 07:07.945
(Door opens)

07:10.960 --> 07:14.657
I've examined your wife, sir.

07:15.720 --> 07:17.506
She is within a month of her time.

07:17.680 --> 07:19.181
And I have some concern.

07:19.360 --> 07:21.703
What does she complain of now?

07:21.880 --> 07:23.142
Of nothing, sir.

07:23.320 --> 07:27.825
She merely answered my question
about the nature of your marital relations.

07:28.880 --> 07:31.223
She had no right to discuss
such matters with you!

07:31.400 --> 07:34.619
She has every right, as do I, to ensure
the safety of your unborn child.

07:37.040 --> 07:39.622
You have, if I may say so,
a substantial physique.

07:39.800 --> 07:42.507
Unless you wish to risk crushing the child...

07:42.680 --> 07:44.545
You're suggesting I forego my...

07:44.720 --> 07:46.426
mY conjugal rights?

07:47.360 --> 07:51.706
To a man of God, abstinence
can surely be no hardship.

07:56.120 --> 07:58.224
Not in the least, sir.

08:11.760 --> 08:16.663
Those men we took on when George
shut Leisure, they're at 40 level.

08:16.840 --> 08:19.217
Could we make use of the new arrivals there?

08:20.240 --> 08:23.869
- 'Tis not down to you to feed half the county.
- True.

08:24.040 --> 08:26.622
But the tiresome creatures sicken and starve.

08:27.400 --> 08:30.745
And it's damned expensive,
mopping up corpses, digging new graves.

08:31.800 --> 08:33.222
Cheaper to find them a pitch.

08:33.400 --> 08:36.039
For my own convenience, I see no other way.

08:40.160 --> 08:45.666
Ah, Zacky, will you tell my patients
I'll be with them directly? Thank you.

08:45.840 --> 08:48.820
Forgive me, I was disagreeably detained.

08:49.000 --> 08:52.982
- By whom?
- George Warleggan and Reverend Whitworth.

08:53.160 --> 08:55.720
I can't decide which encounter
was the more unpleasant.

08:55.880 --> 08:57.097
In what regard?

08:57.960 --> 09:01.066
Hmm... Nothing I'm at liberty to disclose...

09:02.200 --> 09:03.986
...regrettably.

09:33.840 --> 09:37.344
A rare bloom...for one still rarer.

09:39.840 --> 09:41.421
(She exhales)

09:48.280 --> 09:50.942
OSSIE: The Reverend Philip Webb
is lately deceased.

09:51.120 --> 09:54.180
And the parish at St Sawle is worth 200 a year.

09:54.360 --> 09:58.262
I feel it an excellent opportunity
to add to my portfolio.

09:58.440 --> 10:00.749
- You live in Truro.
- Reverend Webb lived in London.

10:00.920 --> 10:04.697
God rest his soul. And paid Odgers
40 a year to manage the parish.

10:04.880 --> 10:07.257
I would do the same.

10:07.440 --> 10:09.817
I might even preach there.

10:10.000 --> 10:11.627
Occasionally.

10:11.800 --> 10:14.826
I've applied to the Dean of Exeter,
in whose gift the living lies,

10:15.000 --> 10:19.505
emphasising my Godolphin credentials
and connection to Lord Falmouth.

10:19.680 --> 10:23.662
Forget Falmouth. Since I intend to vanquish
his nominee on election day,

10:23.840 --> 10:26.343
you'd do better to apply to Sir Francis and I.

10:27.560 --> 10:29.585
Oh, well, in that case...

10:30.600 --> 10:35.947
...I feel sure your support would sway
the decision in my favour, hm?

10:38.960 --> 10:40.939
(Chickens cluck)

10:43.680 --> 10:45.341
(Horse neighs)

10:50.200 --> 10:52.179
(Laughter)

10:55.480 --> 11:01.225
Oh, um...Lieutenant Armitage brought me
a plant from his uncle's garden.

11:01.400 --> 11:03.186
It seems we share a love of flora.

11:03.360 --> 11:05.100
And fauna? (Whistles)

11:05.280 --> 11:07.339
- (Barking)
- The mangy, flea-ridden variety?

11:07.520 --> 11:11.149
Ohh! Down! Down! Out!

11:11.320 --> 11:12.503
Out!

11:13.360 --> 11:15.703
- He's charming.
- Like his mistress.

11:15.880 --> 11:18.940
- When he first came, he was wholly uncouth.
- Like his mistress?

11:19.120 --> 11:22.897
- Will you stay to dinner?
- I'm expected at the Teagues.

11:23.600 --> 11:26.239
Mrs Teague has four unmarried daughters.

11:27.640 --> 11:30.541
Having escaped one prison,
I am in no haste to enter another.

11:31.440 --> 11:33.419
You take a very sour view of marriage.

11:33.600 --> 11:37.627
But not of love. For in love,
we keep company with the gods.

11:38.560 --> 11:41.381
I don't think Mrs Teague
will be thinking along those lines.

11:41.560 --> 11:43.539
(Both laugh)

11:54.080 --> 11:55.786
(Door opens)

11:56.600 --> 11:58.579
(Footsteps)

12:17.000 --> 12:18.820
(Gasps softly)

12:25.120 --> 12:28.066
He lives in a dream, Armitage.

12:28.240 --> 12:31.220
You know his sight is failing?

12:32.280 --> 12:34.305
Pity. He's an able navigator.

12:38.840 --> 12:40.660
Yet he isn't a dream.

12:41.520 --> 12:43.067
He's very real.

12:47.520 --> 12:51.149
And I rely on your wonderful common sense
to remember that.

12:54.120 --> 12:55.701
I'll take him to bed.

13:04.160 --> 13:07.379
I have wonderful common sense?
Mind I don't box your ears with it.

13:07.560 --> 13:11.303
If 'ee had any sense, maid, ee'd be tumbling
about the meadow with that pretty boy.

13:11.480 --> 13:13.061
- Oh, Prudie!
- Well.

13:13.240 --> 13:18.382
Makes the blood boil to hear Mr Ross
talking like there's none to compare with he.

13:19.320 --> 13:20.981
Perhaps there ain't.

13:22.040 --> 13:24.907
Never know till you try!
(Chuckles)

13:50.920 --> 13:52.660
(Waves crashing)

14:25.160 --> 14:28.744
Fire and iron, fire and brimstone.
Both possessed.

14:28.920 --> 14:33.027
- 'Tis a good a way as any to drive off heartache.
- A well chosen wife would do the same.

14:34.240 --> 14:36.105
For thee also, brother?

14:37.920 --> 14:39.785
EMMA: Good day, all.

14:39.960 --> 14:42.622
My brothers sing in praise of wedded bliss.

14:42.800 --> 14:45.587
- You think I'm right?
- Do I look the marrying kind?

14:45.760 --> 14:50.902
As I see it, a girl's only power be
when she have men dangling on a string.

14:51.080 --> 14:53.742
Once they get her, the string's round her neck.

14:54.520 --> 14:56.943
Choose wisely and it needn't be.

14:58.880 --> 15:00.859
Can 'ee fettle this? I'll return tomorrow.

15:16.560 --> 15:18.425
Valentine, my sweet.

15:18.600 --> 15:21.899
Shall we ask Papa if he'd like
us to accompany him to Truro?

15:22.080 --> 15:24.059
Imagine him as a Member of Parliament!

15:24.240 --> 15:28.461
Papa...is going to Tregothnan.

15:29.120 --> 15:30.587
To see Lord Falmouth?

15:31.320 --> 15:34.824
To inform him of the burgesses' decision.
And thence to Truro.

15:35.000 --> 15:37.264
And an election is no place for children.

15:38.320 --> 15:40.185
May we wish you luck?

15:40.360 --> 15:42.339
Unnecessary.

15:48.360 --> 15:51.659
Ah, gentlemen! Apologies.
I had business with my steward.

15:53.240 --> 15:56.346
Now, you'll be wishing to know
the name of your new member.

15:56.520 --> 15:59.865
It is Mr Jeremy Salter of Exeter,
a distant cousin of mine.

16:00.040 --> 16:02.600
Here are his credentials.
He is the man to vote for.

16:02.760 --> 16:05.900
You'll wish to circulate them
in time for the voting this afternoon.

16:06.080 --> 16:10.141
Your Lordship, the burgesses met last night.

16:11.280 --> 16:13.225
Oh, good. Good.

16:13.400 --> 16:16.858
And, as Your Lordship knows,
have always voted as you directed.

16:17.040 --> 16:18.905
Naturally.

16:19.080 --> 16:22.459
And if they ever felt bereft of choice,
the promise of favours,

16:22.640 --> 16:27.225
or the threat of their withdrawal, has made them
sensible of the need for compliance.

16:27.400 --> 16:28.822
So the issue is...?

16:30.680 --> 16:35.424
They now wish to vote
according to their own inclination.

16:37.800 --> 16:40.439
Do they presume to suggest
some candidate of their own?

16:43.480 --> 16:45.937
I myself have been asked to stand.

16:46.880 --> 16:49.019
An entirely disinterested party.

16:50.640 --> 16:53.746
And from trade, like your sponsor Basset.

16:53.920 --> 16:55.785
We are not in France, sir.

16:55.960 --> 16:58.940
Your pitiful attempt at a revolution
is doomed to fail.

16:59.120 --> 17:01.338
So commend me to your friends, gentlemen.

17:02.320 --> 17:04.185
All have received favours from me,

17:04.360 --> 17:07.181
as I'll remind them
when I see them this afternoon.

17:08.480 --> 17:09.617
Good day.

17:25.680 --> 17:26.999
PRUDIE: Garrick, get down!

17:27.160 --> 17:28.184
(Barking)

17:28.360 --> 17:31.102
Garrick, get down! Jeremy,
why do you have to do that?

17:31.280 --> 17:33.987
Is this what Caroline and I
have to look forward to?

17:34.160 --> 17:35.866
I somehow doubt it.

17:36.040 --> 17:38.099
Truro will be worse. It's election day.

17:38.280 --> 17:41.226
And the voting begins at two.
Shall we go together?

17:41.400 --> 17:44.142
My husband wants me to join him
at the Red Lion for the results.

17:44.320 --> 17:47.141
I believe he dislikes me entertaining
while he's away.

17:47.320 --> 17:49.823
No guest would give me a moment's disquiet.

17:51.000 --> 17:52.627
Except perhaps Hugh.

17:55.320 --> 17:57.299
Bodrugan.

17:58.400 --> 18:00.186
I'll get my hat.

18:00.360 --> 18:02.544
ANNOUNCER: Gentlemen, voting to elect

18:02.720 --> 18:05.507
TrurO's n_ext Member of Parliament
wrll now commence.

18:13.520 --> 18:18.025
Oh, Mr Buscombe, that contract
I obtained for you last month.

18:18.200 --> 18:19.861
It may have to be cancelled.

18:23.760 --> 18:28.299
Mr Noye, your purchase of land at St Clement,
it may now not go through.

18:29.920 --> 18:31.626
Disgraceful.

18:31.800 --> 18:33.506
Quite so.

18:33.680 --> 18:35.386
Yet the alternative...

18:40.000 --> 18:42.707
I sympathise. Your dilemma is acute.

18:42.880 --> 18:44.859
(Signs)

18:47.120 --> 18:48.940
Gentlemen.

18:51.160 --> 18:52.502
Sister?

18:52.680 --> 18:54.705
- (Exhales heavily)
- What is it?

18:55.920 --> 18:57.387
(Panﬁng)

18:58.360 --> 19:01.944
(Morwenna moans in pain)

19:08.320 --> 19:10.185
Mrs Whitworth?

19:10.360 --> 19:12.225
Tell her I'll come at once.

19:13.160 --> 19:16.823
If we run into George,
don't tease him on his defeat.

19:17.000 --> 19:18.979
I may not be able to resist.

19:20.880 --> 19:23.542
(Morwenna cries out)

19:24.360 --> 19:26.999
Mrs Whitworth's labours
have taken a dangerous turn.

19:27.160 --> 19:29.742
- She's fallen into convulsions.
- The child will live?

19:29.920 --> 19:33.185
At present, I'm concerned
for the safety of mother and child.

19:33.360 --> 19:35.339
(Wailing)

19:38.600 --> 19:42.548
Dear Lord, I begin to comprehend your purpose.

19:42.720 --> 19:45.985
You see now that my present wife
is unsuited to this life.

19:47.560 --> 19:50.267
And if you ordain
that I should be widowed again...

19:50.440 --> 19:54.740
- (Morvvenna screaming)
- Guide thou my footsteps toward...

19:54.920 --> 19:56.979
a suitable replacement.

20:01.240 --> 20:03.026
- Mr Fawcett!
- Yes, Lord Falmouth?

20:03.200 --> 20:05.839
The loan of 35 I made to you.

20:06.000 --> 20:07.900
It may have to be repaid.

20:08.080 --> 20:10.025
(Morwenna screams)

20:12.760 --> 20:14.261
Vicar?

20:15.120 --> 20:18.419
Forgive me. Dr Enys thought you should know.

20:20.320 --> 20:22.185
You have a son.

20:27.560 --> 20:30.461
Travesty! Unbelievable!

20:31.520 --> 20:35.104
You will shortly see a different result
affecting your finances and trade...

20:35.280 --> 20:37.419
Let us leave this despot to his rantings.

20:37.600 --> 20:40.023
...where your contracts are cancelled.

20:40.200 --> 20:42.259
And your loans revoked!

20:47.520 --> 20:49.226
Six-and-a-half pounds!

20:49.400 --> 20:51.106
My mother will be delighted.

20:51.280 --> 20:55.740
I've already chosen a name:
John Conan Godolphin Osborne,

20:55.920 --> 20:57.785
as a nod to the family connection.

20:57.960 --> 21:00.702
- Mrs Whitworth is sleeping.
- She survived?

21:01.520 --> 21:04.387
- Your prayers have been answered.
- Oh, indeed. Yes.

21:04.560 --> 21:06.425
God be praised.

21:06.600 --> 21:08.579
When can I see my son?

21:13.440 --> 21:16.147
- He won?
-Judas!

21:16.320 --> 21:17.389
Ifslunacy!

21:17.560 --> 21:19.778
HARRIS: You placed me
in a deuced awkward position.

21:19.960 --> 21:23.782
I enjoyed cordial relations with Basset
despite our banking rivalry.

21:23.960 --> 21:26.827
And I fully support his wish for reform.

21:27.000 --> 21:28.706
Yet I voted against him.

21:28.880 --> 21:31.906
- The devil you did.
- I need hardly add,

21:32.080 --> 21:35.629
- had you accepted the nomination...
- I would not have been suitable.

21:35.800 --> 21:38.257
Basset's second choice is far less so.

21:38.440 --> 21:41.944
Sir Francis seems a decent man at heart.

21:42.120 --> 21:43.621
(Door opens)

21:43.800 --> 21:45.119
(George chuckles)

21:47.080 --> 21:51.062
Ross, this is well met.
Are you here to congratulate me?

21:51.240 --> 21:53.105
I came to town with no other purpose.

21:53.280 --> 21:55.544
- Hm.
- When do you take your seat?

21:56.600 --> 21:58.977
Next week. I shall take a house in London.

21:59.160 --> 22:00.707
Then we'll no longer be neighbours.

22:00.880 --> 22:04.577
Oh, during summer recess...if I cannot avoid it.

22:06.840 --> 22:10.617
But if Trenwith becomes surplus to
requirements, I may think of selling.

22:10.800 --> 22:13.257
- You should make him an offer.
GEORGE: Don't waste your time.

22:13.440 --> 22:16.420
- It will never become available to you.
SIR FRANCIS: Now, now, sir.

22:16.600 --> 22:18.625
How does Geoffrey Charles at his new school?

22:18.800 --> 22:22.577
I fear he's inherited his father's idle habits.

22:22.760 --> 22:26.662
At school, as you recall,
his father was cleverer than either of us.

22:26.840 --> 22:31.061
A promise he did not fulfil. I, of course,
pay the whole cost of the boy's schooling,

22:31.240 --> 22:33.947
when he should, by rights,
have sufficient income of his own.

22:34.120 --> 22:35.860
_ - From_ what? _
- HIS shares In your mIne.

22:36.040 --> 22:38.679
- Elizabeth sold his shares.
- Under pressure, to you.

22:38.840 --> 22:41.183
At a fraction of their worth.

22:42.240 --> 22:44.504
And what news of Aunt Agatha's headstone?

22:44.680 --> 22:49.026
- Could I possibly care less?
- I'll call and discuss it with Elizabeth.

22:50.440 --> 22:54.183
- You will do no such thing.
- Since it's a Poldark family matter...

22:54.360 --> 22:56.305
- Elizabeth is not a Poldark.
- She was.

22:59.000 --> 23:00.467
And so is her son.

23:02.400 --> 23:04.220
Damn you, Ross. Damn your blood!

23:05.920 --> 23:07.467
This is not seemly.

23:07.640 --> 23:11.940
It does not become a gentleman
nor a Member of Parliament.

23:19.720 --> 23:21.585
My apologies, sir.

23:33.000 --> 23:34.820
My regards to Westminster.

23:47.280 --> 23:49.987
- (Laughs)
- To Mr Warleggan!

23:50.160 --> 23:52.139
Our new Member of Parliament.

23:52.320 --> 23:54.697
But, then, what do that make thee?

23:54.880 --> 23:56.666
Not to be crossed.

23:58.480 --> 24:03.543
And useful to know. Think on that, maid.

24:03.720 --> 24:05.699
(Laughs)

24:13.840 --> 24:16.217
Parson Came!

24:16.400 --> 24:19.107
Have you been here all this time?

24:19.280 --> 24:21.589
Why would 'ee not come
and have a drink with us?

24:22.680 --> 24:24.261
The Lord hath forbid it.

24:25.120 --> 24:27.179
What do 'ee hope to gain from stalking me?

24:29.080 --> 24:32.425
- A soul for God.
- And naught for thyself?

24:36.120 --> 24:37.781
Walk me home.

24:37.960 --> 24:40.520
And mind 'ee don't lay your hands on me
behind a hedge.

24:42.680 --> 24:46.559
- I never would.
- Oh! For the Lord forbid it.

24:48.400 --> 24:50.664
What a killjoy 'ee be.

24:50.840 --> 24:52.819
Come on, Bufflehead.

25:10.560 --> 25:12.539
(Baby grizzles)

25:15.920 --> 25:18.138
(Low conversation)

25:18.320 --> 25:20.185
And you are?

25:20.360 --> 25:22.225
Begging your pardon, Vicar.

25:22.400 --> 25:24.265
Arthur Solway from the library.

25:24.440 --> 25:26.658
I brought these books for Miss Rowella.

25:26.840 --> 25:28.705
I disapprove of libraries.

25:28.880 --> 25:33.385
The danger of exposing uninstructed minds
to ideas beyond their scope.

25:34.480 --> 25:36.744
These are histories, sir. Of France and...

25:36.920 --> 25:38.706
Be off with you!

25:55.800 --> 25:58.177
So, my dear, you are to go to Westminster.

25:58.360 --> 26:01.944
Where shall we take a house?
Caroline speaks highly of Hatton Garden.

26:02.120 --> 26:05.385
- But Lady Whitworth favours Fitzroy Square.
- I shall be going alone.

26:11.680 --> 26:13.705
Why did you go to speak to Dwight?

26:18.320 --> 26:19.947
What a peculiar question.

26:20.960 --> 26:22.348
Is it?

26:25.560 --> 26:28.506
Every husband needs time away
from his wife and children.

26:28.680 --> 26:31.057
It makes them more appreciative
when he returns.

26:31.720 --> 26:34.700
And I shall have much to do
in my first weeks in London.

26:35.520 --> 26:39.900
Forging connections with those that matter
must come before family distractions.

26:40.080 --> 26:42.184
So I'm to remain here?

26:43.320 --> 26:45.299
For both our sakes.

26:48.960 --> 26:51.144
(Door slams, baby grizzles)

27:26.520 --> 27:28.829
GEORGE: You have my list of instructions?

27:29.720 --> 27:34.862
Yes, sir. Only regarding Mrs Warleggan...

27:35.880 --> 27:38.098
Yes? What part of my orders is unclear?

27:38.280 --> 27:41.864
You will watch her-
where she goes, who she meets.

27:46.960 --> 27:48.939
(Thunder rumbles)

28:28.640 --> 28:30.824
This just come from Tregoth... What's it?

28:31.000 --> 28:32.706
Tregothnan?

28:32.880 --> 28:34.859
I wondered how long it would take.

28:38.280 --> 28:42.057
Lord Falmouth invites us to visit
before his nephew returns to sea.

28:43.000 --> 28:44.865
Of course, that's merely the pretext.

28:45.040 --> 28:47.224
- His real motive...
- Is what?

28:47.400 --> 28:49.379
We'll soon see.

28:51.480 --> 28:53.584
And Lieutenant Armitage?

28:53.760 --> 28:55.705
- Do he have another motive?
- Oh, shush!

28:55.880 --> 28:57.745
(Laughs)

29:08.320 --> 29:11.460
There he goes. Cornwall's hope for democracy.

29:11.640 --> 29:16.179
Are you content? He speaks for Cornwall
while you stay home and plough your fields?

29:16.360 --> 29:18.225
Entirely content.

29:18.400 --> 29:20.265
I like to be out of doors.

29:20.440 --> 29:23.739
The climate of Westminster
would not agree With me.

29:41.800 --> 29:43.859
What do 'ee want, Sam?

29:44.040 --> 29:45.746
To bring 'ee to God.

29:45.920 --> 29:47.899
I don't believe 'ee.

29:48.920 --> 29:53.698
I suspicion what 'ee wants...is me.

29:56.440 --> 29:59.864
IfI want 'ee, Emma, 'tis in purity of heart

30:00.040 --> 30:02.941
in the belief that your soul could turn to Christ.

30:08.160 --> 30:09.741
And if I want 'ee in another way,

30:09.920 --> 30:11.899
'tis not from carnal lust.

30:15.280 --> 30:18.067
But from a wish to sanctify our union.

30:19.120 --> 30:22.578
You're asking I to wed 'ee?

30:24.640 --> 30:26.267
Iam.

30:27.960 --> 30:30.383
I've rolled in the hayfields with many a man.

30:30.560 --> 30:34.826
I've drunk and cavorted and cussed.

30:35.000 --> 30:37.742
- And I've prayed for 'ee.
- 'Tis a waste of breath, Sam.

30:39.080 --> 30:40.547
For I'm happy in my sin.

30:40.720 --> 30:44.304
As you're happy in your goodness.

30:48.440 --> 30:50.021
Right.

30:52.960 --> 30:57.340
You're a rare good man, Sam.
But not for the likes of me.

31:18.720 --> 31:20.699
How do you do, ma'am?

31:21.920 --> 31:23.501
You're quite the young gentleman.

31:23.680 --> 31:25.545
- Is Uncle George here?
- In London.

31:25.720 --> 31:27.699
So it's just we two?

31:28.760 --> 31:30.148
And Valentine.

31:30.320 --> 31:32.299
Well, in that case...

31:34.120 --> 31:35.701
Can we have cakes by the fire?

31:38.520 --> 31:40.499
And jellies and cream!

31:47.560 --> 31:49.539
ROWELLA: Do you not love him?

31:50.920 --> 31:52.899
I must find a way.

31:54.960 --> 31:56.939
It's no fault of his that I struggle.

32:01.920 --> 32:03.501
What is it?

32:04.320 --> 32:05.821
This morning...

32:07.120 --> 32:08.860
...Osborne came to me...

32:10.920 --> 32:13.480
...demanding that I...

32:15.400 --> 32:16.469
...that he...

32:16.640 --> 32:20.588
Did not Dr Enys advise at least
six weeks of abstinence?

32:20.760 --> 32:22.625
He did.

32:22.800 --> 32:25.746
I wish he had advised six centuries.

32:32.080 --> 32:33.866
Try to rest, sister.

32:40.080 --> 32:42.139
I'll return when I've taken a bath.

32:45.040 --> 32:47.019
(Door closes, footsteps)

32:48.160 --> 32:50.139
(Grunts softly)

33:07.200 --> 33:08.701
(Ossie exhales)

33:12.160 --> 33:14.299
(He whimpers softly)

33:29.880 --> 33:31.347
We will say a prayer.

33:31.520 --> 33:33.306
No! Ossie, please! I cannot!

33:33.480 --> 33:36.460
It'll soon be over. _
Just close your eyes and submit.

33:36.640 --> 33:38.505
No, please!

33:38.680 --> 33:40.659
(Waves crashing)

34:06.600 --> 34:09.239
I confess, cousin, I'd hoped to see you stronger.

34:11.400 --> 34:12.719
I will be soon.

34:15.800 --> 34:18.109
It grieves me that I cannot nurse my baby.

34:19.040 --> 34:21.907
I wanted to,
but Osborne insisted on a wet nurse.

34:24.400 --> 34:26.743
Rowella, can you take me to visit the child?

34:26.920 --> 34:28.899
Of course.

34:35.720 --> 34:38.541
- I've missed you, Wenna.
- And I you.

34:38.720 --> 34:42.907
School is very diverting, but it doesn't
compare to the beach at Hendrawna

34:43.080 --> 34:45.059
and our days there together.

34:45.920 --> 34:47.501
Yes.

34:48.040 --> 34:49.667
Do you still think of him?

34:52.440 --> 34:54.067
You mustn't ask me that.

34:55.000 --> 34:56.581
I shall visit him soon.

34:57.600 --> 34:59.500
May I tell him that I've seen you?

34:59.680 --> 35:01.500
No.

35:02.840 --> 35:04.182
Yes.

35:04.880 --> 35:06.859
Tell him...

35:08.800 --> 35:10.779
Tell him I do not forget him.

35:11.840 --> 35:13.501
And never will.

35:16.320 --> 35:18.185
If anything, she grows worse.

35:18.360 --> 35:20.225
What treatment has she had?

35:20.400 --> 35:22.265
Since the birth, none at all.

35:22.440 --> 35:27.059
The Vicar believes it's a nervous complaint,
which must be ignored.

35:28.160 --> 35:30.902
Ah, cousin Elizabeth!

35:31.080 --> 35:33.787
You find us in excellent health?

35:33.960 --> 35:36.144
On the contrary. I find Morwenna failing.

35:36.320 --> 35:38.584
Why has Dr Enys not been sent for?

35:38.760 --> 35:40.625
The expense, for one thing.

35:40.800 --> 35:44.145
For another, I wonder if it's wise
to pander to hysterics.

35:45.240 --> 35:48.869
Osborne, if you do not send for Dr Enys, I will.

35:52.360 --> 35:55.545
I must again ask you a delicate question,
Mrs Whitworth.

36:00.720 --> 36:04.224
Good God, sir, the impertinence!
Of course I resumed marital relations.

36:04.400 --> 36:07.346
- You must cease forthwith.
- How dare you!

36:07.520 --> 36:10.182
I insist. Her body has not healed.
Nor her nerves.

36:10.360 --> 36:12.863
If, after a month, my treatment
has brought no improvement,

36:13.040 --> 36:15.019
you may dispense with my services.

36:16.320 --> 36:19.062
I beg your pardon, Vicar.

36:21.880 --> 36:24.940
A month, then. For my wife's sake.

36:34.440 --> 36:36.305
Prudie!

36:36.480 --> 36:39.062
What do we think for Tregothnan,
the scarlet or the green?

36:39.240 --> 36:42.539
It's only a small gathering.
No need to get fligged up.

36:43.280 --> 36:45.066
I have some business to attend to.

36:46.920 --> 36:50.469
Might as well wear sackcloth.
It will have the same effect on some folk.

36:53.480 --> 36:55.459
(Wind howling)

37:15.160 --> 37:16.627
Elizabeth.

37:17.600 --> 37:20.182
I came to see Agatha's grave.

37:21.520 --> 37:23.499
I too.

37:29.760 --> 37:32.399
I gather from George
there's to be no headstone.

37:32.560 --> 37:34.744
- When did you speak to George?
- On election day.

37:34.920 --> 37:36.547
We met at the Red Lion.

37:39.880 --> 37:41.745
Is something amiss?

37:41.920 --> 37:44.104
Newly amiss, you mean?

37:44.960 --> 37:47.463
You know it vexes him every time he sees you.

37:48.760 --> 37:51.706
He cannot still be jealous
of our former attachment?

37:53.600 --> 37:55.784
Whatever was between us is long past.

37:58.320 --> 38:00.959
Its consequences may not be.

38:03.400 --> 38:04.867
What does he imagine?

38:05.040 --> 38:07.019
Ross, what do you think he imagines?

38:08.160 --> 38:10.344
That Valentine is not his child.

38:13.200 --> 38:14.337
And is he?

38:17.240 --> 38:20.266
- I cannot say.
- You will not say.

38:21.880 --> 38:23.905
I will not say.

38:25.760 --> 38:29.264
What does George suspect?

38:29.440 --> 38:31.180
Have you never hinted?

38:32.200 --> 38:33.827
Do you think me a monster?

38:34.000 --> 38:36.264
To injure the woman I once loved?

38:36.440 --> 38:39.079
- Demelza, then.
- It would destroy her to speak of it.

38:39.240 --> 38:40.377
Then who?

38:46.880 --> 38:48.859
Who else was in the house that night?

38:51.520 --> 38:52.737
Agatha.

38:56.760 --> 38:58.625
Dear God.

38:58.800 --> 39:02.065
Since the day of her death,
he's been icy towards me.

39:03.080 --> 39:06.982
She must have told her suspicions,
for she could not know for sure.

39:12.400 --> 39:15.506
Precisely what does George suspect?

39:16.480 --> 39:18.266
He will not say.

39:19.000 --> 39:20.467
Make him say.

39:22.400 --> 39:27.667
Then deny it. Lie, if necessary.
He has no proof that Valentine is mine.

39:27.840 --> 39:30.024
There is no proof.

39:32.840 --> 39:36.219
You're the one person who can do this,
Elizabeth.

39:38.600 --> 39:41.706
I know George.
He would do anything to keep you.

39:43.000 --> 39:44.945
He's wanted you from the moment he met you.

39:45.120 --> 39:47.304
I saw how he looked at you then.

39:47.480 --> 39:50.142
I never dreamed he stood a chance.

39:51.800 --> 39:53.745
Nor did he.

39:56.280 --> 39:57.417
Nor did I.

39:59.640 --> 40:02.347
Can you imagine how I felt
when I learned he was to have you?

40:02.520 --> 40:04.499
You left me in no doubt that night.

40:08.200 --> 40:09.462
Forgive me.

40:10.440 --> 40:12.385
And thereafter?

40:12.560 --> 40:14.425
Leaving me with no word.

40:14.600 --> 40:17.546
- Making no attempt to see me.
- How could I?

40:17.720 --> 40:21.497
To break up your life afresh...my life.

40:21.680 --> 40:23.227
Our families.

40:25.840 --> 40:27.705
And now, is it not perverse

40:27.880 --> 40:30.826
to try and save a marriage
you did your best to prevent?

40:31.000 --> 40:33.503
For the sake of your son...

40:34.560 --> 40:36.425
...do you not wish to save it?

40:41.880 --> 40:43.745
(Signs)

40:43.920 --> 40:45.899
I wish to save it.

40:48.280 --> 40:50.259
Then there's one thing you can do,

40:51.080 --> 40:54.664
which would put a seal on George's trust
which no one could ever dispute.

40:56.400 --> 40:58.140
Give him another child.

40:58.320 --> 41:01.539
- That cannot alter what's gone before.
- It could.

41:02.320 --> 41:05.187
If there was some...confusion over the dates.

41:05.360 --> 41:08.944
If it could seem to him
like another eight-month child.

41:15.120 --> 41:16.337
I must go.

41:18.840 --> 41:20.467
Yes.

41:50.080 --> 41:52.139
Goodbye, Ross.

42:03.720 --> 42:07.065
I'd sooner_ make a wheel _
than learn stupid Latin declen5ions.

42:07.240 --> 42:09.105
T'ain't only Latin, though.

42:09.280 --> 42:11.145
You're learning how to be a gentleman.

42:11.320 --> 42:14.460
When I inherit Trenwith,
you'll come and live there as my steward.

42:14.640 --> 42:16.619
And we'll make wheels together.

42:21.360 --> 42:23.225
I saw her today.

42:23.400 --> 42:26.221
She's had her child.

42:30.640 --> 42:32.426
She asked me to give you a message.

42:53.400 --> 42:55.539
DEMELZA:
You went to visit Aunt Agatha's grave?

42:55.720 --> 42:57.699
What did you find there?

43:00.800 --> 43:02.779
Things I needed to attend to.

43:05.320 --> 43:06.901
(Exhales)

43:11.560 --> 43:13.539
I met Elizabeth.

43:16.280 --> 43:19.340
For the first time in years, we talked.

43:21.240 --> 43:24.346
At first, she was hostile. But then she softened.

43:30.280 --> 43:32.259
I kissed her.

43:34.080 --> 43:36.219
I love her, Demelza.

43:37.440 --> 43:39.305
Not as I did.

43:39.480 --> 43:41.459
But with fondness.

43:43.680 --> 43:45.659
The ghost of a love.

43:49.240 --> 43:51.902
I pity her. I want to help her.

43:53.080 --> 43:57.062
My conscience is sore for I treated her ill.

44:01.000 --> 44:04.106
Fifteen years ago,
I would have given the earth for her.

44:06.320 --> 44:08.299
And she hasn't changed.

44:09.720 --> 44:11.699
She's no less lovely.

44:14.160 --> 44:16.139
But I have.

44:17.400 --> 44:19.027
I have changed.

44:20.440 --> 44:22.419
Because of you.

44:26.440 --> 44:29.944
Ross, what things needed attending to?

44:34.920 --> 44:37.184
I thought granite for the headstone.

44:37.360 --> 44:39.499
Nothing else will survive the elements.

44:39.680 --> 44:43.343
Now if you've finished asking questions,
may I dress for dinner?

44:55.560 --> 44:57.539
My dear friends.

44:59.840 --> 45:01.705
Welcome.

45:01.880 --> 45:05.987
Ross, my uncle would esteem it
a favour if you'd join him in his study.

45:06.160 --> 45:08.060
You may trust your wife to my care.

45:11.720 --> 45:13.039
I would hope so.

45:16.640 --> 45:19.017
I assume Falmouth has some proposal for Ross.

45:19.200 --> 45:21.907
To put a sack over the head
of his beautiful wife?

45:23.080 --> 45:26.026
So his nephew doesn't make
a complete fool of himself.

45:30.040 --> 45:33.464
Tell me, Poldark, what are your ambitions?

45:35.560 --> 45:37.539
To live as I want.

45:38.600 --> 45:40.500
To raise a family...

45:40.680 --> 45:42.819
care for the people around me.

45:43.000 --> 45:44.661
To be unencumbered of debt.

45:44.840 --> 45:46.660
I think you underestimate your talents.

45:46.840 --> 45:49.502
I am wholly aware of my capabilities.

45:51.160 --> 45:53.299
I am also aware they are not for sale.

45:57.080 --> 45:59.059
You and I have something in common.

46:00.800 --> 46:03.177
We dislike George Warleggan.

46:05.120 --> 46:07.987
- And?
- His friend, Sir Francis Basset.

46:08.840 --> 46:11.183
George and Sir Francis are not that alike.

46:11.360 --> 46:13.703
Despite current appearances.

46:13.880 --> 46:15.268
True, they're both wealthy.

46:15.440 --> 46:18.546
And their power has been generated
through the labour of others.

46:18.720 --> 46:23.623
But whilst Sir Francis values his menials,
George despises them.

46:26.880 --> 46:29.519
As do many who enjoy inherited powers.

46:35.280 --> 46:37.145
Basset is the new order. I am the old.

46:37.320 --> 46:39.185
He seeks to overthrow me.

46:39.360 --> 46:42.340
I would like you to help me prevent him.

46:43.120 --> 46:45.304
And how would I do that?

46:56.000 --> 46:57.581
I'm the unhappiest of men.

46:59.120 --> 47:03.147
The woman I love more than life is married
to the man to whom I owe my life.

47:05.800 --> 47:08.701
And now I am going away,
I can't bear the thought of losing her.

47:09.880 --> 47:11.859
How can you lose what you've never had?

47:12.040 --> 47:15.669
I've had her company, her conversation.

47:17.680 --> 47:19.625
The sound of her voice, the touch of her hand.

47:21.800 --> 47:24.826
I suspect what you think you've had,

47:25.000 --> 47:27.560
the woman you think you see...

47:29.120 --> 47:30.781
...is not really there at all.

47:30.960 --> 47:33.178
And you think I idolise her?

47:35.040 --> 47:37.065
It is not perfection that I seek.

47:41.560 --> 47:44.939
'Tis flesh and blood.

47:51.720 --> 47:53.620
I think I should like some more port.

48:08.320 --> 48:11.346
When George's course is set,
it's hard to unseat him.

48:11.520 --> 48:13.624
Nonetheless, I invite you to try.

48:15.760 --> 48:18.422
There's one possible way to obstruct
his parliamentary progress.

48:18.600 --> 48:22.479
- Which is?
- Reconcile your aims with those of Sir Francis.

48:22.640 --> 48:25.382
- Our views are totally opposed.
- I see that.

48:25.560 --> 48:28.506
You're a hereditary peer
who exists to command.

48:28.680 --> 48:31.137
You take governance as your right.

48:32.240 --> 48:34.424
For you, the common man has no rights.

48:34.600 --> 48:38.024
And never will.
He would not know what to do with them.

48:38.200 --> 48:40.418
No, it is for we, the aristocracy, to govern.

48:40.600 --> 48:43.865
Who better to uphold the traditions
that made our country great?

48:44.040 --> 48:47.737
The tradition of governing through promised
favours and purchased influence?

48:51.040 --> 48:54.020
Your exploits in France impressed me.

48:55.080 --> 48:59.585
I assumed you'd gone there
to strike a blow against revolution.

49:00.640 --> 49:03.666
I now find you are one of its advocates.

49:04.880 --> 49:08.759
You are mistaken, my Lord. I do not
endorse bloodshed and lawlessness.

49:08.920 --> 49:12.344
But liberty, equality, fraternity?

49:13.360 --> 49:15.225
These I can put my name to.

49:15.400 --> 49:19.587
I have no intention of so doing.
No, power must exist.

49:19.760 --> 49:21.625
Someone must possess it.

49:21.800 --> 49:25.497
And since man is not perfect,
sometimes it is misused.

49:25.680 --> 49:27.545
But who is more likely to misuse it?

49:27.720 --> 49:32.384
The man who newly finds it in his grasp,
like one who has never before tasted liquor?

49:33.120 --> 49:36.704
Or the man who by heredity, like you and I,

49:36.880 --> 49:38.745
has learned to take it in his stride?

49:38.920 --> 49:44.040
Who may taste the heady brew
without becoming drunk on it.

49:50.240 --> 49:52.105
I think I must rejoin my wife.

49:52.280 --> 49:54.259
She will think I've abandoned her.

50:05.040 --> 50:09.386
Do not ask me for a smile

50:09.560 --> 50:14.577
Life is short but love is long

50:14.760 --> 50:19.663
Let me not your heart beguile

50:19.840 --> 50:24.539
Pray content you with a song

50:24.720 --> 50:29.100
Do not ask me for a kiss

50:29.280 --> 50:34.422
Life is short but love is long

50:34.600 --> 50:39.185
You may never know that bliss

50:39.360 --> 50:44.582
So I offer you this song

50:44.760 --> 50:48.742
Do not ask me for my heart

50:48.920 --> 50:54.267
Life is short but love is long

50:54.440 --> 50:59.639
Knowing we are soon to part

50:59.800 --> 51:05.340
Consolation be my song

51:27.080 --> 51:30.743
- I must go up and rest.
- Before you do, sister, this came for you.

51:33.280 --> 51:34.861
(Door opens)

51:35.040 --> 51:37.349
Going to bed, my dear?

51:39.240 --> 51:42.619
Take all the time you need.
Nothing matters more than your wellbeing.

51:42.800 --> 51:44.620
Thank you, Osborne.

52:01.000 --> 52:04.584
Excuse me, Vicar. I'm going to my room.

52:25.520 --> 52:27.181
My love.

52:32.560 --> 52:34.539
(SObs)

52:46.800 --> 52:49.360
- Did you want me, Vicar?
- Ah, yes.

52:49.520 --> 52:52.819
I want to speak with you about...

52:54.520 --> 52:56.784
- ...your reading.
- The Iliad?

52:57.640 --> 52:59.665
At which part are you now?

52:59.840 --> 53:02.183
Patroclus has just been slain by Hector.

53:02.360 --> 53:05.545
Now there is a terrible fight about his body.

53:09.800 --> 53:13.679
For as you know, Vicar,
it is of great importance to the Greeks

53:13.840 --> 53:17.469
that the funeral rites be performed
in full upon the body.

53:17.640 --> 53:19.858
Body. Yes.

53:20.920 --> 53:24.185
Why do I not think you're very interested
in this story, Vicar?

53:24.360 --> 53:26.464
Call me Osborne, would you?

53:26.640 --> 53:28.505
Should you like to sit down, Vicar?

53:28.680 --> 53:30.545
Oh, er...

53:30.720 --> 53:33.280
I think you would.

53:35.000 --> 53:36.547
Should you like me to sit on your lap?

53:36.720 --> 53:38.585
I'm not sure I...

53:38.760 --> 53:40.978
But of course you would.

53:44.640 --> 53:46.141
(Groans)

53:49.480 --> 53:51.027
(Baby grizzles)

54:09.040 --> 54:11.019
(Flames crackle)

54:24.640 --> 54:27.063
You seem...far away.

54:31.280 --> 54:34.545
No more than you when you returned
from Sawle churchyard.

54:36.080 --> 54:38.981
We swore we'd keep no more secrets
from each other, Ross.

54:39.160 --> 54:42.459
I have nothing to tell. Do you?

54:45.800 --> 54:47.188
Yes.

54:47.880 --> 54:49.859
Though I think you will find it hard to hear.

54:50.040 --> 54:51.667
Try me.

54:55.480 --> 54:57.459
I want to tell you that...

54:59.240 --> 55:01.105
...I wish I could be two people.

55:01.280 --> 55:04.579
One, your loving wife,
the mother of your children,

55:04.760 --> 55:08.059
content in our life,
as I am and as I ever wish to be.

55:08.240 --> 55:10.617
And the other?

55:12.920 --> 55:14.785
Someone else.

55:14.960 --> 55:16.939
Someone new...

55:18.480 --> 55:20.300
...who could love another just for a day.

55:20.480 --> 55:22.425
- Another?
- Laugh with him, kiss him.

55:22.600 --> 55:26.661
Love him. Just for a day without feeling
disloyal to the man I truly love.

55:37.080 --> 55:42.017
And do you think...
another would be content with that?

55:45.200 --> 55:47.657
I don't know.

55:49.040 --> 55:50.507
Would you?

55:51.680 --> 55:53.261
I think so.

55:54.160 --> 55:56.720
For I know who it is who truly owns my heart.

55:58.680 --> 56:00.580
Do you doubt it?

56:08.160 --> 56:10.025
Not till tonight.

56:12.120 --> 56:14.543
Till I saw you look at him...

56:16.520 --> 56:18.340
...the way you once looked at me.

56:22.960 --> 56:25.064
I will look at you that way again, Ross.

56:26.920 --> 56:28.899
Just be patient with me.

56:29.800 --> 56:31.779
As I have been patient with you.

56:45.080 --> 56:47.059
(Waves crashing)
