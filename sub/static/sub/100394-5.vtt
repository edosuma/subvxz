WEBVTT

00:07.094 --> 00:08.095
- Previously
on "Project Blue Book"...

00:08.225 --> 00:09.139
- No more secrets.

00:09.270 --> 00:11.185
- From now on,
you and I,

00:11.315 --> 00:12.969
we are going to work as a team.

00:13.100 --> 00:15.189
- The CIA has acquired
intelligence detailing

00:15.319 --> 00:16.538
an imminent threat.

00:16.668 --> 00:18.235
- Where exactly
is this intel coming from?

00:18.366 --> 00:19.541
- Her name is Rebecca.

00:19.671 --> 00:21.804
- Psychics as a national
defense strategy.

00:21.934 --> 00:23.066
- Where do you find
these people?

00:23.197 --> 00:25.590
- That's something
I can't share.

00:25.721 --> 00:27.375
- What you need to know
about me is,

00:27.505 --> 00:29.203
we want the same thing,

00:29.333 --> 00:32.075
but even when the truth
flies right over your head,

00:32.206 --> 00:34.034
it's still
impossible to believe.

00:34.164 --> 00:35.122
- But why do you need me?

00:35.252 --> 00:37.298
- It's simple.
I don't exist.

00:39.300 --> 00:42.172
- Mimi?
- She's not here.

00:42.303 --> 00:44.131
Or Joel.

00:44.261 --> 00:46.046
- What is this?

00:46.176 --> 00:47.699
What do you want?

01:36.922 --> 01:38.359
There's some aspirin over there

01:38.489 --> 01:41.318
if you need some.

01:41.449 --> 01:43.364
You and I can have
a little talk.

01:50.110 --> 01:51.372
Where am I?

01:51.502 --> 01:53.722
- Let me get you
a glass of water.

01:57.073 --> 01:58.335
- My family.

01:58.466 --> 01:59.902
- Safe and sound at home.

02:00.032 --> 02:01.164
Don't worry.
It's not about them.

02:01.295 --> 02:02.861
How much longer?
- Less than ten.

02:05.255 --> 02:06.865
- When we were last in touch,

02:06.996 --> 02:09.738
I told you to stay
out of the way.

02:09.868 --> 02:13.133
Remember?
Go back to your old life.

02:13.263 --> 02:15.700
You didn't listen.

02:15.831 --> 02:17.441
- What exactly is it
that you want from me?

02:17.572 --> 02:21.402
- Take these.
You'll feel much better.

02:21.532 --> 02:23.969
They're just aspirin.
I promise.

02:27.059 --> 02:28.235
If you want answers
to your questions,

02:28.365 --> 02:30.715
you're gonna need
to prove to me

02:30.846 --> 02:34.502
that you can take
my instructions seriously.

02:34.632 --> 02:37.069
It's gonna be very important
over the next 48 hours.

02:44.555 --> 02:45.426
- Hello?

02:45.556 --> 02:47.079
- Mimi, it's me.

02:47.210 --> 02:49.343
- Allen, thank God.
Where are you?

02:49.473 --> 02:52.172
I came home and you were gone,
and Joel was waiting outside.

02:52.302 --> 02:53.869
He didn't have a key.
Is everything okay--

02:53.999 --> 02:55.827
- No, it's fine.
I'm fine.

02:55.958 --> 02:57.525
Just...

02:57.655 --> 02:59.875
tell Joel--tell him I'm sorry.

03:00.005 --> 03:02.486
I had to go out of town.
I'm at the airport now.

03:02.617 --> 03:04.314
- Where is it this time?

03:04.445 --> 03:05.750
- Mimi, you know
I can't tell you everything.

03:05.881 --> 03:08.449
We've talked about this,
remember?

03:08.579 --> 03:10.494
- Is the captain with you?

03:10.625 --> 03:15.412
- No, I'm just out here chasing
one of my crazy theories again.

03:15.543 --> 03:18.328
I won't be gone long, though,
so I'll check in again soon.

03:21.070 --> 03:22.506
Um...

03:22.637 --> 03:24.160
kiss Joel goodnight for me.

03:24.291 --> 03:26.858
Okay?

03:26.989 --> 03:28.817
Can you do that?

03:30.427 --> 03:31.950
- Of course.

03:32.081 --> 03:35.215
- I love you.

03:35.345 --> 03:36.999
- I love you, too.

03:43.179 --> 03:44.659
- Mom?

03:46.574 --> 03:49.141
Is everything okay?

03:55.235 --> 03:58.673
- Now...

03:58.803 --> 04:01.241
what do you know
about Maury Island?

04:01.371 --> 04:02.981
- Maury Island?

04:03.112 --> 04:04.983
What's that got to do
with why I'm here?

04:05.114 --> 04:10.075
- It's the most important UFO
encounter in American history.

04:10.206 --> 04:13.078
Follow instructions, professor.
Remember?

04:15.646 --> 04:17.387
- Uh...

04:17.518 --> 04:19.737
21st of June, 1947,

04:19.868 --> 04:23.350
just two weeks
before the events in Roswell,

04:23.480 --> 04:27.223
a fisherman
by the name of Ernest Reed

04:27.354 --> 04:31.227
was out in Puget Sound,
checking his traps.

04:31.358 --> 04:34.578
After he's out there
about an hour,

04:34.709 --> 04:37.146
something appeared overhead.

04:41.585 --> 04:43.500
He described them as...

04:43.631 --> 04:46.677
round, silver craft

04:46.808 --> 04:48.853
with holes in the middle,

04:48.984 --> 04:50.594
far bigger than the size
of his boat.

04:50.725 --> 04:53.380
And despite
being able to hover

04:53.510 --> 04:55.643
less than a hundred feet
over his head...

04:55.773 --> 04:57.645
- What in the name of God?

04:57.775 --> 05:00.648
- It didn't make a sound.

05:00.778 --> 05:04.434
That is, not until one of them
appeared to be in distress.

05:06.567 --> 05:07.611
He said he wasn't sure

05:07.742 --> 05:10.397
if the craft
was falling apart,

05:10.527 --> 05:15.619
or whether it was bombing him
with these metal fragments.

05:15.750 --> 05:17.752
And that is when
all hell broke loose.

05:37.119 --> 05:38.381
Mayday! Mayday!

05:38.512 --> 05:41.210
This is the Sophie Rose 0426.

05:41.341 --> 05:45.301
I am under attack from...

05:45.432 --> 05:46.998
alien ships.

05:47.129 --> 05:49.914
Repeat. Mayday!
Mayday!

05:52.613 --> 05:54.310
- Professor does do
his homework.

05:54.441 --> 05:56.660
- Yeah, enough to know
that Reed recanted his story

05:56.791 --> 05:58.009
shortly after the incident.

05:58.140 --> 06:01.622
- Oh, and that's never
happened before, has it?

06:01.752 --> 06:04.233
After government
inspectors show up?

06:06.975 --> 06:09.499
- You were there?
- In the shadows, yeah.

06:09.630 --> 06:12.415
And I can assure you that Reed
was telling the truth.

06:12.546 --> 06:14.591
There's plenty of physical
evidence to back it up.

06:14.722 --> 06:16.245
You even had some
in your hands.

06:16.376 --> 06:18.900
- I have?

06:22.556 --> 06:25.733
That object you had me steal
from White Forest.

06:25.863 --> 06:28.126
That was from Maury Island?

06:28.257 --> 06:33.784
- It will be our key
to first contact.

06:33.915 --> 06:37.266
But only if we can find
more of it.

06:40.269 --> 06:42.140
- Say that again.
You have a code?

06:42.271 --> 06:43.490
- I'm telling you,
it's not official.

06:43.620 --> 06:45.405
It's what he said
on the phone.

06:45.535 --> 06:47.624
How he said it.

06:47.755 --> 06:50.105
- "Kiss Joel goodnight for me."

06:56.154 --> 06:57.808
- Joel's going through
this phase where he hates that.

06:57.939 --> 06:59.375
So for Allen to say it,

06:59.506 --> 07:01.377
you have to trust me,
something is wrong.

07:01.508 --> 07:05.729
- Mimi. I trust you.
Let's just back things up.

07:07.731 --> 07:08.558
What else did he say?

07:08.689 --> 07:11.082
- Something about...

07:11.213 --> 07:13.868
chasing down one
of his crazy theories again.

07:13.998 --> 07:15.217
Do you know
what that could mean?

07:15.347 --> 07:16.566
- Doc's crazy theories.

07:16.697 --> 07:18.525
- I'm telling you,
he wouldn't disappear

07:18.655 --> 07:20.440
without telling me where,
especially after last year

07:20.570 --> 07:23.094
with all the crazy secrets
you two were keeping.

07:25.401 --> 07:26.315
Captain?

07:29.144 --> 07:31.538
- I'm gonna need you
to stay here for a bit.

07:31.668 --> 07:33.670
Base is the safest place
for you and Joel.

07:33.801 --> 07:36.847
Faye!
- We shouldn't go home now?

07:36.978 --> 07:38.458
- Not until I figure this out.

07:41.112 --> 07:42.026
- Do you know
what's happening?

07:42.157 --> 07:43.201
- I may know someone
who can help.

07:43.332 --> 07:44.333
- Well,
then I'm coming with you.

07:44.464 --> 07:45.508
- No, you are staying here.
Faye!

07:45.639 --> 07:46.814
- If Allen's in trouble, then--

07:46.944 --> 07:48.468
- If Doc's in trouble,
the last thing he'd want

07:48.598 --> 07:49.773
is for you to put yourself
at the same risk.

07:49.904 --> 07:52.210
- But he knows
I can take care of myself.

07:52.341 --> 07:53.473
I came to you for help,
Captain,

07:53.603 --> 07:56.519
and you are not gonna start
by lying to me.

07:56.650 --> 08:01.524
I want to know what the hell
you think is going on.

08:01.655 --> 08:03.178
- Faye, I'm gonna need
you to make some space

08:03.308 --> 08:06.268
for Mimi and Joel for a bit,
maybe even the night.

08:08.705 --> 08:09.619
She's not allowed
off this base.

08:09.750 --> 08:10.968
- Okay.

08:13.841 --> 08:16.452
- Why me, and why now?

08:16.583 --> 08:18.933
- Because it took six years

08:19.063 --> 08:21.457
to understand
what the metal is for.

08:21.588 --> 08:23.372
As far as you're concerned,

08:23.503 --> 08:25.417
when the esteemed
Professor Hynek,

08:25.548 --> 08:27.463
one of the most well respected
men in his field,

08:27.594 --> 08:31.467
says that he has met visitors
from another world,

08:31.598 --> 08:34.252
well, who's gonna doubt him?

08:34.383 --> 08:36.603
- You really believe
that's gonna work?

08:39.083 --> 08:41.477
- It's why I've been grooming
you this whole time, Professor.

08:45.699 --> 08:47.439
Forgot something.

08:55.143 --> 08:58.450
Now that you're gonna
play the part...

08:58.581 --> 09:01.105
you're gonna have to dress
like it, too.

09:06.894 --> 09:09.113
So you don't stand out.

09:09.244 --> 09:13.988
One of our strengths
is anonymity.

09:14.118 --> 09:16.425
- Who exactly are you people?

09:31.962 --> 09:34.486
- I think that color
suits you quite well.

09:34.617 --> 09:35.836
Who knows?

09:35.966 --> 09:37.359
Maybe when this
is all over with,

09:37.489 --> 09:39.579
you might even decide
to stay with us.

09:42.669 --> 09:44.453
Dr. Hynek.

10:11.523 --> 10:13.482
- You're being awfully quiet.

10:13.613 --> 10:15.658
- Something
you'd like me to say?

10:15.789 --> 10:19.662
- Well, at some point,
I will expect a thank you.

10:19.793 --> 10:23.623
I am giving you the opportunity
of a lifetime, Professor.

10:23.753 --> 10:26.147
Was I wrong about D.C.?

10:29.498 --> 10:31.674
- How did you know?

10:31.805 --> 10:33.937
That date, the time...

10:34.068 --> 10:36.374
where the UFOs would be.

10:36.505 --> 10:39.464
- I think you already know
the answer to that question.

10:39.595 --> 10:41.945
He told you who I am.

11:04.751 --> 11:06.535
- Captain.
- Morning.

11:09.059 --> 11:11.061
- Please, come in.

11:15.849 --> 11:18.112
Uh, can I help you
with something?

11:18.242 --> 11:22.377
I just have a plane to catch.

11:22.507 --> 11:24.640
- Doc told me he spoke
with you about someone

11:24.771 --> 11:27.687
at that lab of yours
the other day...

11:27.817 --> 11:29.558
who could see the future,
like what's her name?

11:29.689 --> 11:32.082
- Rebecca.
- Rebecca.  Yes.

11:32.213 --> 11:34.258
Remember that?
- I do.

11:34.389 --> 11:36.260
- I think
he may have kidnapped him.

11:36.391 --> 11:38.741
Details are
a little fuzzy right now,

11:38.872 --> 11:41.439
but the doc is missing,
and I think that this guy

11:41.570 --> 11:44.399
may have something
to do with it.

11:44.529 --> 11:46.314
Hoping you can help.

11:49.709 --> 11:51.362
You know
who I'm talking about.

11:51.493 --> 11:54.670
- If we're talking about
the same guy, yes, I do.

11:54.801 --> 11:57.629
- Then why do you
look more worried than I do?

12:02.025 --> 12:03.679
Yeah, all right.

12:07.074 --> 12:08.858
- His name is William.

12:08.989 --> 12:10.947
He was a member
of our program years back.

12:11.078 --> 12:13.036
Before I was there.

12:13.167 --> 12:15.038
He was very gifted.

12:15.169 --> 12:17.127
But also very dangerous.

12:17.258 --> 12:19.695
- They thought I was dangerous.

12:19.826 --> 12:22.393
- What, because you could
see the future?

12:22.524 --> 12:24.961
- Because I could see
the potential.

12:25.092 --> 12:27.137
Beyond intelligence.

12:27.268 --> 12:29.270
- So you left the program?

12:29.400 --> 12:32.708
- No one ever leaves
the program.

12:32.839 --> 12:34.928
I escaped.

12:35.058 --> 12:38.105
Along with some others
who believed as I did.

12:38.235 --> 12:40.716
- Believed what?

12:40.847 --> 12:45.242
- He had a theory
about UFOs and contact

12:45.373 --> 12:49.681
that he and other members
of the program were conduits,

12:49.812 --> 12:52.423
antennas,
as he liked to call them,

12:52.554 --> 12:56.340
that were meant
to communicate with, uh...

12:56.471 --> 12:58.168
- Little green men.
- Mm-hmm.

12:58.299 --> 13:00.257
There was no
reasoning with him.

13:00.388 --> 13:03.173
- The CIA only
wanted to cover up the truth.

13:03.304 --> 13:06.655
The truth I suspect
you already know.

13:06.786 --> 13:07.830
- This is madness.

13:07.961 --> 13:09.745
- You never thought the same?

13:09.876 --> 13:12.226
You see why I chose you?

13:12.356 --> 13:16.143
Because you and I,
we're a lot alike.

13:16.273 --> 13:18.754
- So how do we find him?

13:18.885 --> 13:19.929
- The agency
has been looking for years.

13:20.060 --> 13:21.235
I wish I knew.

13:21.365 --> 13:23.498
- What about Rebecca?
Huh?

13:23.628 --> 13:24.934
Isn't that her specialty?

13:25.065 --> 13:27.589
- We tried.

13:27.719 --> 13:29.417
She can't see him.

13:34.901 --> 13:37.425
- She never tried
to find Hynek, though.

13:43.300 --> 13:44.693
- I'm still working
on getting you and Joel

13:44.824 --> 13:46.651
a spot in the barracks,

13:46.782 --> 13:47.087
but it shouldn't take
much longer.

13:47.217 --> 13:49.785
- Thank you.

13:49.916 --> 13:52.005
Faye,
my husband's still out there,

13:52.135 --> 13:53.354
and he needs my help.

13:53.484 --> 13:55.617
I can't just, you know,
sit here right now.

13:55.747 --> 13:56.966
- I'm so sorry.

13:57.097 --> 13:59.316
I can't imagine
what you're going through.

14:03.277 --> 14:05.975
- If I could just look
at the Blue Book reports,

14:06.106 --> 14:08.064
the classified ones,

14:08.195 --> 14:10.327
maybe I could
try and help find him.

14:10.458 --> 14:13.287
- I wish I could
help you with that,

14:13.417 --> 14:17.247
but, um, if I grant you access
to those documents--

14:17.378 --> 14:20.555
- That would put you at risk.
Of course.

14:26.126 --> 14:28.780
- Why don't I take Joel
on a tour of the base?

14:28.911 --> 14:32.262
That way,
you can stay by the phone

14:32.393 --> 14:34.264
in case the captain calls.

14:36.876 --> 14:38.181
- I'd appreciate that.

14:43.230 --> 14:45.841
- I imagine we'd probably
be gone at least an hour.

14:47.974 --> 14:49.627
- Thank you.

14:49.758 --> 14:50.802
- For what?

14:53.240 --> 14:54.806
- Van Dyke delivers.

14:54.937 --> 14:55.895
It's a groundball
back to the pitcher.

14:56.025 --> 14:56.896
He knocked it down.
- Come on, boys.

14:57.026 --> 14:58.549
You got this.
Come on.

15:00.769 --> 15:02.597
What?

15:04.120 --> 15:05.600
- Hello, Ernest.

15:08.037 --> 15:11.040
Relax.
This won't take long.

15:15.479 --> 15:19.440
- Mr. Reed, would you like
to have a seat, please?

15:19.570 --> 15:20.920
- We're not here to hurt you.

15:22.922 --> 15:24.532
- I never said
anything to anybody.

15:24.662 --> 15:25.794
All these years,
just like you said.

15:25.925 --> 15:26.926
I swear.

15:27.056 --> 15:29.667
- Professor.

15:29.798 --> 15:31.974
- Mr. Reed, this is gonna be
very easy, okay?

15:32.105 --> 15:35.108
We just--all we need
from you is for you to give us

15:35.238 --> 15:36.805
the location of where
the initial incident occurred.

15:36.936 --> 15:39.242
Can you do that?
Just...

15:39.373 --> 15:41.897
circle the spot where you saw
the ships that afternoon

15:42.028 --> 15:43.899
and where the metal fell
and we'll be on our way.

15:44.030 --> 15:45.857
That's it.

15:48.034 --> 15:49.818
- Is this a joke?

15:49.949 --> 15:51.385
Look, there were no ships.
No metal.

15:51.515 --> 15:53.169
It never happened--
- We're not the Air Force.

15:53.300 --> 15:55.041
This is not a test.
Just tell us the truth.

15:55.171 --> 15:58.218
- I am.

15:58.348 --> 16:01.134
- What, are you saying you
were making the whole thing up?

16:01.264 --> 16:04.093
- Look, I was trying
to collect on some insurance.

16:04.224 --> 16:07.967
Some fire damage on my boat.
Now, you know that.

16:08.097 --> 16:11.057
- No, that was a story
you told the investigators

16:11.187 --> 16:14.974
to keep them from bothering you
after we showed up.

16:15.104 --> 16:16.497
- But it's the truth.

16:22.068 --> 16:23.591
- No, what are you doing?
What are you doing?

16:23.721 --> 16:26.202
- The Air Force
told you to lie.

16:26.333 --> 16:29.075
We came to you for the truth.

16:29.205 --> 16:31.512
Now if they're still
paying you to keep lying--

16:31.642 --> 16:33.514
- Nobody's paying me anything.

16:33.644 --> 16:36.212
- No, put that gun away.
Put it away.

16:36.343 --> 16:38.998
- There were never any ships.

16:39.128 --> 16:41.652
- Then I guess
we are wasting our time.

16:49.443 --> 16:50.879
- Please, you don't...

16:51.010 --> 16:52.228
you don't have to do this.
Please.

16:52.359 --> 16:53.882
- If you shoot this man,

16:54.013 --> 16:57.016
you are never
going to get what you want.

16:57.146 --> 16:58.539
Not unless
you understand the process

16:58.669 --> 17:02.456
of thermohaline circulation
and how to account for it.

17:02.586 --> 17:03.631
- Unless I what?

17:03.761 --> 17:06.068
- Look,
it's really not my area,

17:06.199 --> 17:07.417
but you understand
what I'm talking about, yes?

17:07.548 --> 17:08.897
- Yes.
- Oceanic upwelling?

17:09.028 --> 17:10.594
- Mm-hmm.

17:10.725 --> 17:13.641
- Ocean currents are driven
by global density gradients

17:13.771 --> 17:17.471
created by surface heat
and freshwater fluxes,

17:17.601 --> 17:20.604
so anything, anything landing
on the seafloor that long ago,

17:20.735 --> 17:23.085
almost certainly
will have moved.

17:23.216 --> 17:25.957
So even if Mr. Reed
can pinpoint the location

17:26.088 --> 17:28.482
of that metal six years ago,

17:28.612 --> 17:30.919
he can't guarantee anything
is gonna still be there, right?

17:31.050 --> 17:32.703
- That's right.
- But as someone

17:32.834 --> 17:34.662
who sailed
this water for years,

17:34.792 --> 17:36.011
you're gonna have
a better understanding

17:36.142 --> 17:39.014
of where it
may have drifted to, yes?

17:39.145 --> 17:40.885
- Yes, sir.

17:41.016 --> 17:44.106
- So...not unless
you want to go out there

17:44.237 --> 17:46.108
running around in circles,
looking for something

17:46.239 --> 17:49.807
that no one can help you find
but Mr. Reed here,

17:49.938 --> 17:52.810
you need to keep him alive.

17:52.941 --> 17:55.117
And you need
to take him with us.

18:06.128 --> 18:07.912
- You remember Captain Quinn.

18:10.524 --> 18:12.352
- Nice to see you again.

18:12.482 --> 18:15.224
- Something's wrong.

18:15.355 --> 18:17.139
From the look on your face.

18:17.270 --> 18:19.098
I'm not picking up anything,
if that's what you're thinking.

18:22.362 --> 18:24.755
- We need your help.

18:24.886 --> 18:26.801
Captain Quinn's
colleague is missing.

18:26.931 --> 18:29.064
- Dr. Hynek.
You remember him?

18:29.195 --> 18:31.066
- What happened?
- Let's...

18:31.197 --> 18:32.459
try to give a clean
assessment first

18:32.589 --> 18:34.678
before we give any details.

19:14.892 --> 19:17.373
Well...

19:17.504 --> 19:21.160
it's all so very hazy.

19:21.290 --> 19:23.814
Um...

19:23.945 --> 19:28.515
but I know that this,
this part is important.

19:28.645 --> 19:33.084
I'm just not sure why.

19:33.215 --> 19:35.913
I'm sorry.
I wish I could tell you more.

19:36.044 --> 19:38.742
- Well, none of it
looks familiar to you?

19:41.397 --> 19:44.966
- I need Hynek right now
to help me find Hynek.

19:46.359 --> 19:47.795
What a colossal waste of time.

19:47.925 --> 19:49.188
- Yeah, let's forget about
the pictures for a second.

19:49.318 --> 19:51.538
Now, what would William
need with him?

19:51.668 --> 19:54.367
His access, his expertise,
his what?

19:54.497 --> 19:56.151
- Well, he did have Doc steal
something for him once.

19:56.282 --> 19:57.196
- Steal what?

19:57.326 --> 19:59.894
- It was a...

20:01.548 --> 20:03.027
It's not important.

20:03.158 --> 20:04.464
- Then why'd you bring it up?

20:04.594 --> 20:07.902
Look,
don't play games with me here.

20:08.032 --> 20:11.079
- Hang on.
Hold this up.

20:18.304 --> 20:19.696
Son of a bitch.

20:19.827 --> 20:22.046
- What? What is it?
- I gotta make a phone call.

20:25.049 --> 20:27.182
- Which boat is yours?

20:27.313 --> 20:30.403
- The Sophie Rose
there on the end of the dock.

20:34.189 --> 20:36.235
- Are we gonna find anything
when we get out there?

20:36.365 --> 20:37.801
- I don't know.

20:37.932 --> 20:40.413
Maybe he knows
something I don't.

20:40.543 --> 20:41.544
He's got me so confused,

20:41.675 --> 20:43.111
I don't know
what I believe anymore.

20:43.242 --> 20:46.027
I don't know what's real.

20:46.157 --> 20:47.594
- Run for help.

20:47.724 --> 20:50.379
- What?
- I'll take care of him.

20:50.510 --> 20:51.380
Do it,
or we could both get killed.

20:51.511 --> 20:53.687
You understand?
Go.

20:58.082 --> 20:59.910
- Get the professor!

21:11.139 --> 21:12.662
You know what you just did?

21:12.793 --> 21:14.882
- You never had any intention
of bringing him back alive

21:15.012 --> 21:17.798
after he showed us
where to go.

21:17.928 --> 21:20.148
- Get him on the boat.
We gotta get out of here.

21:20.279 --> 21:23.456
- But what am I
looking at here?

21:23.586 --> 21:27.764
Okay. Is this the object
the professor had to steal?

21:30.506 --> 21:32.856
Is it classified?

21:36.817 --> 21:39.167
You come to me,
ask for help.

21:39.298 --> 21:40.603
I not only give it to you,

21:40.734 --> 21:42.649
I bring you
into a classified program

21:42.779 --> 21:44.346
that puts me at risk again.

21:44.477 --> 21:47.349
So either you start
being honest with me,

21:47.480 --> 21:49.438
or you can get
the fuck out of my lab.

21:51.875 --> 21:53.703
- Yes,
it looks like what Hynek stole.

21:53.834 --> 21:55.531
And yes, it was classified.

21:55.662 --> 21:57.054
The only other thing
you need to know

21:57.185 --> 21:59.709
is that it could lead us
back to Hynek.

22:02.495 --> 22:05.236
Who I'm pretty sure
is in real trouble right now.

22:05.367 --> 22:07.935
From someone
who used to work here.

22:11.155 --> 22:13.419
How do you get a goddamn
dial tone on this thing?

22:22.253 --> 22:24.038
- Project Blue Book.

22:24.168 --> 22:25.561
- Mimi.

22:25.692 --> 22:27.084
It's Captain Quinn.

22:27.215 --> 22:30.131
- Perfect.
I think I found something.

22:30.261 --> 22:31.698
- Can you put Faye, please?
It's urgent.

22:31.828 --> 22:33.613
- The man in the black hat,
the one who told Allen

22:33.743 --> 22:36.529
about the events in D.C.,
I think he may be involved.

22:36.659 --> 22:39.314
Allen told me he's someone
to be concerned with,

22:39.445 --> 22:42.709
and there's this photo
here from 1947.

22:42.839 --> 22:44.101
- I'm not sure yet,

22:44.232 --> 22:46.103
but you might be
onto something.

22:46.234 --> 22:49.846
There's this other piece,
also this...

22:49.977 --> 22:52.371
something Doc stole
from a base in New Mexico.

22:52.501 --> 22:55.330
- Was it that piece of metal?
- You know about that.

22:55.461 --> 22:58.507
- It may be part
of a UFO invasion from 1947.

22:58.638 --> 23:00.727
Washington State.

23:00.857 --> 23:04.600
One where metal debris
rained down from the sky.

23:04.731 --> 23:07.734
And it also happened to be...

23:07.864 --> 23:12.695
the first reported sighting
of men in black hats...

23:12.826 --> 23:14.567
who came to silence a town.

23:14.697 --> 23:16.351
- You sure about this?

23:16.482 --> 23:19.528
- I'm looking
at the photo right now.

23:19.659 --> 23:20.486
- Where in Washington?

23:22.662 --> 23:24.446
- Funny, isn't it?

23:24.577 --> 23:27.449
For centuries, man used
the stars as his only map.

23:27.580 --> 23:29.233
Now, look.
You and I are using

23:29.364 --> 23:31.192
maps to chase the stars.

23:31.322 --> 23:33.455
- We're almost there.

23:35.370 --> 23:37.416
Port side, 20 degrees.

23:37.546 --> 23:39.635
Slow ahead.
200 yards.

23:39.766 --> 23:43.596
- Port side, 20 degrees.
Slow ahead, 200 yards.

23:43.726 --> 23:45.380
- That was admirable what you
did back there, by the way.

23:45.511 --> 23:46.642
Helping Reed.

23:46.773 --> 23:48.383
Though he didn't
really deserve it.

23:48.514 --> 23:51.386
- And I do?

23:51.517 --> 23:52.996
- After everything
I've shown you,

23:53.127 --> 23:55.999
you still just
can't trust me, can you?

23:58.437 --> 24:00.569
Remote Viewing.

24:00.700 --> 24:02.832
That's what
they called the program.

24:02.963 --> 24:05.400
Although it was really
just another way of waging war.

24:05.531 --> 24:07.358
Make it feel safe.

24:07.489 --> 24:10.492
Calling targets
from that white room.

24:10.623 --> 24:14.714
They asked me to look
at a target run one time.

24:14.844 --> 24:17.456
I told them, "Don't engage.

24:17.586 --> 24:21.329
There's civilians,
parents, children inside."

24:25.507 --> 24:27.857
I remember
I saw this little girl.

24:27.988 --> 24:29.206
She had a little hair brush.

24:29.337 --> 24:31.078
She's brushing
her mother's hair.

24:32.471 --> 24:34.908
Boom!

24:35.038 --> 24:36.997
That's when they detonated
the bomb.

24:37.127 --> 24:39.913
I wasn't really there,
of course.

24:40.043 --> 24:41.697
But I could hear their screams.

24:41.828 --> 24:44.395
I could feel that heat.

24:47.703 --> 24:50.445
I still do.

24:50.576 --> 24:53.883
- I'm sorry.

24:54.014 --> 24:55.842
- They didn't believe me then.

24:55.972 --> 24:58.366
But they'll believe you.

24:58.497 --> 25:00.107
You'll make them believe.

25:02.979 --> 25:05.286
- We're here.

25:05.416 --> 25:06.809
You sure
we're in the right spot?

25:06.940 --> 25:07.897
- Yeah.

25:08.028 --> 25:10.378
See for yourself.

25:10.509 --> 25:12.685
And look, because of you,

25:12.815 --> 25:14.730
we'll soon
be making first contact.

25:30.354 --> 25:31.312
- When you get to the bottom,

25:31.442 --> 25:32.748
grab whatever debris
you can find.

25:32.879 --> 25:34.445
Give two tugs on the rope,
we'll pull you back up.

25:34.576 --> 25:36.535
All right?

25:47.937 --> 25:50.331
- You know, there's no way
to know for sure

25:50.461 --> 25:54.596
if we're even
in the exact spot.

25:54.727 --> 25:56.380
It could all just be

25:56.511 --> 25:59.427
subsurface
bioluminescent algae,

25:59.558 --> 26:01.168
or something like that.

26:04.127 --> 26:06.477
- ♪ Under this shining light

26:06.608 --> 26:08.610
- Go shut that off.
It's distracting.

26:17.924 --> 26:20.579
♪ I am so in love

26:24.365 --> 26:25.584
- Marine radios
don't play music.

26:25.714 --> 26:26.715
- Turn it off!

26:26.846 --> 26:28.325
- I'm trying.

26:49.608 --> 26:51.435
- There, there.
That's the signal.

26:51.566 --> 26:53.568
Pull him up.
Hit the switch.

26:56.310 --> 26:57.790
- Brace yourself!

26:57.920 --> 27:01.532
- Whoa!

27:01.663 --> 27:04.405
- Cut the rope!
Cut the rope!

27:30.953 --> 27:33.173
- What happened?
Did you cut it?

27:33.303 --> 27:35.654
- It just snapped free
on its own.

27:35.784 --> 27:37.481
- Watch, watch, watch, watch!

27:39.701 --> 27:42.661
There. Something's coming up.
What is that?

27:42.791 --> 27:44.663
- I'm not sure.

27:48.492 --> 27:49.493
- There.

27:53.367 --> 27:55.848
- Come on.

27:55.978 --> 27:58.546
- Come on there.

27:58.677 --> 28:00.330
We got you.

28:00.461 --> 28:02.681
-  Yeah.

28:02.811 --> 28:05.335
- I got something.
I got some of the metal.

28:05.466 --> 28:07.337
- Get up.

28:09.035 --> 28:10.210
- Where's Charles?

28:10.340 --> 28:11.733
- He's gone.
- What?

28:11.864 --> 28:13.561
- It's all gone.
We have to go now.

28:13.692 --> 28:14.518
- No, no, no.
We can't just leave him there--

28:14.649 --> 28:17.521
- He's gone!

28:17.652 --> 28:18.566
We have to go now,
or we're gonna die.

28:40.719 --> 28:43.199
- I know what it feels like
to lose a partner.

28:43.330 --> 28:45.549
- My cousin flew
with the Red Tails,

28:45.680 --> 28:48.988
and we were like brothers.

28:49.118 --> 28:50.946
Got shot down over Sicily.

28:51.077 --> 28:52.948
- I'm sorry to hear that.

28:53.079 --> 28:56.560
- Yeah, but I'm sure you got
plenty of those same stories.

28:56.691 --> 28:58.824
See, but I didn't fight
in the war.

28:58.954 --> 29:00.956
- I know.

29:01.087 --> 29:03.350
- How do you know that?

29:03.480 --> 29:06.440
- I just know.

29:06.570 --> 29:08.921
- I did train to be a Marine.

29:09.051 --> 29:10.879
Montford Point, Jacksonville.

29:11.010 --> 29:11.662
- Oh, yeah?
Montford?

29:11.793 --> 29:13.012
- Mm-hmm.

29:13.142 --> 29:14.665
- How'd you
get into Intelligence?

29:14.796 --> 29:16.580
- Well,
my former CO loved to gamble.

29:16.711 --> 29:18.887
Baseball.

29:19.018 --> 29:20.454
Now, I didn't give a shit
about sports,

29:20.584 --> 29:22.543
but I had a knack for research.

29:22.673 --> 29:24.110
Stats, that sort of thing.

29:24.240 --> 29:27.722
I would listen to his picks,
give him my assessment.

29:27.853 --> 29:29.724
He started winning.

29:29.855 --> 29:32.640
Next thing I know,
keeps me from shipping out.

29:32.771 --> 29:34.468
Puts me on the payroll
at the CIG.

29:34.598 --> 29:35.948
- CIG?

29:36.078 --> 29:37.776
- Yeah, CIG was the predecessor
to the CIA.

29:37.906 --> 29:40.082
- Roger that.

29:42.041 --> 29:44.347
- So, uh,

29:44.478 --> 29:47.829
you happy where you are?
Project Blue Book?

29:47.960 --> 29:51.964
- The work I do is vital
to the survival of our country.

29:52.094 --> 29:55.228
Russians want us to panic,
we help keep America calm.

29:55.358 --> 29:59.101
- UFOs,
people from other planets.

29:59.232 --> 30:02.931
You're saying
that we shouldn't panic?

30:03.062 --> 30:04.193
- I think
there's no reason to fear

30:04.324 --> 30:06.630
what we still don't understand.

30:11.548 --> 30:13.289
- How could you that?

30:13.420 --> 30:15.770
Leave your man back there
in the water like that?

30:15.901 --> 30:17.598
- He knew the risks.
- But what if he's still alive?

30:17.728 --> 30:19.034
- Have you forgotten
what's going on here?

30:19.165 --> 30:20.383
What we found down there?

30:20.514 --> 30:23.386
- What, pitchstone?
Volcanic glass?

30:23.517 --> 30:25.171
You find that everywhere
in this region.

30:25.301 --> 30:27.869
- You think it was pitchstone
at the bottom of Puget Sound

30:28.000 --> 30:29.653
that nearly capsized our boat?

30:29.784 --> 30:31.917
- If your anchor
snagged in a log down there,

30:32.047 --> 30:33.135
it gets pulled
into an underwater current

30:33.266 --> 30:34.528
or a whirlpool.

30:34.658 --> 30:35.921
- It wasn't a whirlpool.

30:36.051 --> 30:37.487
- That shot you back
to the surface like that,

30:37.618 --> 30:39.011
dragged off your mask?

30:39.141 --> 30:40.882
- You weren't down there.
You didn't feel what I felt.

30:41.013 --> 30:43.015
- That deep,
lack of oxygen to your brain

30:43.145 --> 30:44.538
will play all kinds
of tricks on your senses.

30:44.668 --> 30:46.975
There is a completely rational
explanation for all of this.

30:47.106 --> 30:49.717
- Tricks? Tricks?

30:51.632 --> 30:54.026
- That kind of skepticism
may be appreciated

30:54.156 --> 30:55.984
by the Air Force, but out here,
it can get you killed.

30:56.115 --> 30:57.029
- Well, maybe you
shouldn't have brought

30:57.159 --> 30:58.944
a scientist with you.

30:59.074 --> 31:01.294
- What kind of a scientist
doesn't want to be responsible

31:01.424 --> 31:05.994
for making the biggest
discovery in all of mankind?

31:06.125 --> 31:08.301
Let's get a move on.
We don't have a lot of time.

31:32.325 --> 31:33.717
- Excuse me.
Sheriff?

31:33.848 --> 31:35.589
- Be with you in a minute.

31:40.681 --> 31:42.117
- Sheriff.

31:42.248 --> 31:44.337
Captain Michael Quinn.
U.S. Air Force.

31:44.467 --> 31:47.906
This is agent Daniel Banks,
CIA.

31:53.346 --> 31:55.130
What can I do for you?

31:55.261 --> 31:56.827
- We're looking
for a missing person

31:56.958 --> 31:58.742
we believe may be
on Maury Island.

31:58.873 --> 32:00.831
- Name's Dr. Allen Hynek.

32:02.311 --> 32:04.139
- Say he's a doctor?

32:06.968 --> 32:09.188
Hey, Reed.

32:09.318 --> 32:11.146
Come over
and take a look at this.

32:13.496 --> 32:15.542
This look like one
of those men to you?

32:15.672 --> 32:17.109
- Oh, my God.
Yeah, that's him.

32:17.239 --> 32:19.676
That's the one.
- You've seen this man here?

32:19.807 --> 32:21.200
- This guy,
along with a couple others,

32:21.330 --> 32:23.985
broke into my house
and kidnapped me.

32:24.116 --> 32:25.639
- Yeah,
I think you got the wrong guy.

32:25.769 --> 32:27.249
- No, I don't.
That's him.

32:27.380 --> 32:29.164
- Wait, wait, wait.
Just hold on a second.

32:29.295 --> 32:30.861
All right, first of all,
what's your name?

32:30.992 --> 32:32.428
- Ernest Reed.
- Mr. Reed,

32:32.559 --> 32:34.953
you're saying that
this man kidnapped you?

32:35.083 --> 32:37.216
- They had guns.

32:37.346 --> 32:39.696
And they forced me
to take them to my boat,

32:39.827 --> 32:41.916
but this guy?

32:42.047 --> 32:43.700
He helped me escape.

32:43.831 --> 32:46.007
- Amy,
show them what you've drawn up.

32:48.444 --> 32:50.794
- He's confident this the man
you're looking for.

32:53.536 --> 32:56.104
- Sheriff, couple of fishermen
just spotted the men in black

32:56.235 --> 32:58.367
on shore about a mile
off the coast of Gig Harbor.

32:58.498 --> 33:00.630
They're headed into the woods.

33:00.761 --> 33:01.805
- Let's go.

33:05.287 --> 33:08.508
- Now we know
how they got ashore.

33:08.638 --> 33:11.728
- Well, we don't know for sure
this came from Reed's boat.

33:11.859 --> 33:14.340
- No telling
where they went from here.

33:14.470 --> 33:16.995
Let's fan out, see what else
we can find, fellas.

33:17.125 --> 33:18.605
- Yes, sir.
- You got it.

33:22.391 --> 33:26.308
- Now, Reed told the sheriff
that Hynek was helping William.

33:26.439 --> 33:27.918
They're on the same team.

33:28.049 --> 33:30.138
- Reed also said
Hynek helped him escape.

33:30.269 --> 33:32.271
- Then why didn't Hynek
escape with him?

33:32.401 --> 33:35.578
- I don't know.

33:35.709 --> 33:37.450
- You know,
when William left the agency,

33:37.580 --> 33:39.800
he took a lot
of people with him.

33:39.930 --> 33:41.671
People who we screened.

33:41.802 --> 33:42.977
Who you never think
crossed the line like that.

33:43.108 --> 33:43.804
- No, that's not Doc.

33:43.934 --> 33:45.893
- No?

33:46.024 --> 33:47.634
Didn't he already
steal classified material?

33:47.764 --> 33:50.419
Is that not like him, either?

33:50.550 --> 33:52.334
Look, I know you want
to believe in your friend here,

33:52.465 --> 33:54.858
but we gotta start
confronting the facts.

34:01.039 --> 34:04.390
What the hell are those?
Coordinates?

34:04.520 --> 34:06.870
- Headed to airstrip, Captain.

34:09.221 --> 34:10.961
Hynek's not with William.

34:11.092 --> 34:13.921
He's trying to help
lead us to him.

34:21.798 --> 34:23.104
- You gonna tell me
where we're going?

34:23.235 --> 34:25.454
- You already know
where we're going.

34:25.585 --> 34:28.283
You had it
figured out all along.

34:28.414 --> 34:30.894
Saw the research
in your office.

34:33.245 --> 34:34.942
- Antarctica?
- Yep.

34:37.510 --> 34:39.947
- Are you sure that's safe?

34:40.078 --> 34:41.731
You know,
there was one other detail

34:41.862 --> 34:44.734
about the Maury Island case
that I didn't tell you.

34:44.865 --> 34:47.215
- Oh, yeah?
What's that?

34:47.346 --> 34:49.478
- After the Army retrieved
the metal that Reed

34:49.609 --> 34:53.395
salvaged from his encounter,
they loaded it onto a plane

34:53.526 --> 34:55.745
a lot bigger than that one.

34:58.400 --> 34:59.967
That plane crashed,

35:00.098 --> 35:01.882
killing the two officers
on board.

35:02.012 --> 35:03.013
- Almost done.
Two minutes.

35:03.144 --> 35:05.712
- Thank you.

35:05.842 --> 35:08.454
What makes you think
I don't know about that?

35:08.584 --> 35:10.934
- Look, if that metal
has such powerful properties,

35:11.065 --> 35:12.110
why fly with it
if you know it brought down

35:12.240 --> 35:13.459
another plane already?

35:13.589 --> 35:15.374
- Oh, so you do think
that it was the metal

35:15.504 --> 35:17.027
that brought the plane down?

35:17.158 --> 35:18.551
I thought you said
it was volcanic glass.

35:18.681 --> 35:20.857
- No, no, no,
the object that I stole

35:20.988 --> 35:23.164
at White Forest was not.
That...

35:23.295 --> 35:24.992
that had properties
and a composition

35:25.123 --> 35:26.167
that I can't explain.

35:26.298 --> 35:28.648
- Because it's not found
on this Earth.

35:31.303 --> 35:34.741
It wasn't the metal
that caused the plane to crash.

35:38.266 --> 35:39.659
- We should've maybe
used the backup.

35:39.789 --> 35:42.140
- No cops.
Way too many questions.

35:42.270 --> 35:44.620
- Well, I still have questions
of my own.

35:44.751 --> 35:46.883
Are you sure
there's an airstrip out here?

35:47.014 --> 35:48.146
- Well, through here
is the only flat patch

35:48.276 --> 35:50.757
of land for miles.

35:50.887 --> 35:52.628
And there it is.

35:57.416 --> 35:59.244
- You sabotaged that plane?
Innocent people died.

35:59.374 --> 36:01.420
- I had to secure
and protect the evidence.

36:01.550 --> 36:03.552
- Air Force officers--
- The same officers

36:03.683 --> 36:05.989
who were sworn
to cover up the truth.

36:06.120 --> 36:08.427
- You don't think
he'd turn now, do you?

36:08.557 --> 36:11.038
- I'll ask him
once we get him out of there.

36:11.169 --> 36:12.431
- All right,
so what's our move?

36:12.561 --> 36:14.781
- All right, Reed said
these guys were armed.

36:14.911 --> 36:15.651
You brought your gun?

36:15.782 --> 36:17.436
- No.

36:17.566 --> 36:19.351
I'm not a cowboy.
I don't carry it everywhere.

36:19.481 --> 36:20.961
- Ready when you are.

36:23.964 --> 36:26.923
- You don't need me anymore.
Let me go.

36:27.054 --> 36:29.535
- If I do,
you'll never forgive yourself.

36:36.237 --> 36:38.021
Get on the plane.

36:45.290 --> 36:47.770
- Whatever we're gonna do,
we need to do it now.

36:47.901 --> 36:50.512
- Okay.
You win.

36:50.643 --> 36:52.210
Let me examine
the metal before we go.

36:52.340 --> 36:53.341
I could run some--

36:53.472 --> 36:55.125
- You're stalling.
You're stalling.

36:55.256 --> 36:56.997
- If it turns out
to be extraterrestrial,

36:57.127 --> 36:58.520
I will get on this plane.

36:58.651 --> 37:00.174
- Wait, where are you going?

37:00.305 --> 37:01.828
- They know you.

37:01.958 --> 37:03.133
They see you coming,
they shoot.

37:03.264 --> 37:05.092
I got this one.
- What you gonna do?

37:05.223 --> 37:07.225
- Just make sure
you got my back.

37:07.355 --> 37:09.009
You'll know when.

37:09.139 --> 37:12.186
- I gave you UFOs over D.C.
What did you do?

37:12.317 --> 37:14.144
You blame it
on temperature inversion.

37:14.275 --> 37:15.624
- I had to.

37:15.755 --> 37:17.539
- I risked my life
to show you that.

37:17.670 --> 37:20.499
- I listened to you.
I followed your breadcrumbs.

37:20.629 --> 37:22.370
I stole for you.

37:22.501 --> 37:23.589
I mean,
what else do you want from me?

37:23.719 --> 37:25.634
- I want you to believe.

37:25.765 --> 37:27.984
- It's not about
what I believe.

37:28.115 --> 37:30.596
It's about what I can prove.

37:30.726 --> 37:33.338
- Professor, I thought
we were kindred spirits.

37:33.468 --> 37:37.255
And now I see how wrong I was.
You're nothing but a coward.

37:37.385 --> 37:39.300
You're afraid of the truth.
- Can you help me out?

37:39.431 --> 37:41.084
- You want the truth?
- My car.

37:43.609 --> 37:44.871
- What are you doing?

37:45.001 --> 37:46.438
- Whoa.
- Don't take another step.

37:46.568 --> 37:47.439
- I just need some help.
My car broke down--

37:47.569 --> 37:48.570
- Hands to your side.

37:48.701 --> 37:49.658
- I don't want any trouble.

37:49.789 --> 37:51.181
I just need some help.
I don't--

37:59.581 --> 38:01.453
- Stop right there, Captain.
Drop it.

38:01.583 --> 38:03.019
- It's all right, Doc.
I got this.

38:03.150 --> 38:05.500
- Daniel.
- Yeah, you must be William.

38:05.631 --> 38:07.589
- You want to tell
this Air Force lackey here

38:07.720 --> 38:09.287
that I'm more important
to the government alive

38:09.417 --> 38:11.114
than I am dead?

38:11.245 --> 38:13.508
- Let's everyone try to relax.

38:13.639 --> 38:14.509
- I'm gonna count to three.

38:14.640 --> 38:16.294
- No, no.
- One.

38:16.424 --> 38:17.295
- Bad idea.
- Two.

38:17.425 --> 38:19.079
- Captain.
- Three.

38:45.453 --> 38:46.585
- Yeah, you take direction
very well.

38:46.715 --> 38:48.369
Thank you.

38:51.720 --> 38:53.766
- He won't be getting far.

38:53.896 --> 38:57.552
- Then what the hell
do you call that?

38:57.683 --> 39:00.250
- Plane's leaking fuel.

39:00.381 --> 39:01.513
He'll be down soon enough.

39:01.643 --> 39:04.124
- Yeah.
But where?

39:13.046 --> 39:14.308
- No, no, it wasn't so much

39:14.439 --> 39:15.527
the rosary beads.
It was the gnomes.

39:18.312 --> 39:22.229
So, uh, seriously...

39:22.360 --> 39:24.710
what do we tell the generals
when we get back?

39:24.840 --> 39:28.148
- I think this one we keep
strictly to ourselves.

39:28.278 --> 39:29.758
Three of us.

39:29.889 --> 39:31.934
- I already got
my people on it.

39:32.065 --> 39:34.763
CIA will make it
like it never happened.

39:34.894 --> 39:39.420
But we'll also do whatever
we can to hunt William down.

39:39.551 --> 39:41.683
Promise.
- Thank you, Daniel.

39:41.814 --> 39:43.381
- Hey, throw me
on that party list, too.

39:43.511 --> 39:46.035
When the time comes.

39:46.166 --> 39:47.297
- You know, um,

39:47.428 --> 39:49.735
you two,
you do make a pretty good team.

39:49.865 --> 39:51.432
- Yeah, he's not bad.

39:51.563 --> 39:53.565
For Central Intelligence.

39:53.695 --> 39:54.957
Let's not make a habit of it,
though.

39:57.133 --> 39:59.919
All right.
You fellas excuse me.

40:00.049 --> 40:03.444
I want to see
if I can get some more ice.

40:05.359 --> 40:08.188
- You had me worried there
for a second, Doc.

40:08.318 --> 40:10.190
Cops thought
you were one of them.

40:10.320 --> 40:14.020
- Yeah,
imagine even you had doubts.

40:14.150 --> 40:16.414
- Well, I thought...

40:16.544 --> 40:19.155
"No way he's wearing that coat
for the rest of his life."

40:21.810 --> 40:25.640
- Yeah, well,
it was all my fault, you know?

40:25.771 --> 40:28.251
I mean, if I hadn't allowed
myself to get taken in by him--

40:28.382 --> 40:30.340
- No, look.

40:30.471 --> 40:34.388
The symbol, the metal, UFOs.

40:34.519 --> 40:36.390
He did show you things, Doc.

40:36.521 --> 40:38.000
There still are
unanswered questions.

40:38.131 --> 40:40.176
- Yeah, but I was ready to take
us to Antarctica, Captain.

40:40.307 --> 40:43.615
Based on what?
Certainly not science.

40:43.745 --> 40:46.400
That could've been me.

40:46.531 --> 40:48.794
- But it's not.

40:48.924 --> 40:53.146
That's why you're here,
and he's out there.

40:59.979 --> 41:02.503
- So how exactly
did you find me?

41:21.304 --> 41:23.045
- Allen?

41:23.176 --> 41:25.265
Allen?

41:25.395 --> 41:26.527
- Mimi.

41:26.658 --> 41:28.486
- You're okay.
- Yes, I am.

41:28.616 --> 41:30.183
Thanks to you.

41:30.313 --> 41:32.141
Quinn told me what you did.

41:32.272 --> 41:33.665
I'm just so sorry, Mimi.

41:33.795 --> 41:35.318
- No, it's okay.

41:35.449 --> 41:36.624
You're home.

41:36.755 --> 41:38.757
You're home.

41:38.887 --> 41:41.455
- Mrs. Hynek, couldn't have
done it without you.

41:41.586 --> 41:43.196
- I know.

41:47.635 --> 41:49.985
- What did you tell Joel?
- Project Blue Book.

41:50.116 --> 41:52.510
- I told him that his dad
was busy working,

41:52.640 --> 41:54.294
and he'd be home soon.

41:54.424 --> 41:56.992
Just don't try
to kiss him goodnight, okay?

41:57.123 --> 41:58.646
- It's amazing that you picked
up on that enough to know.

41:58.777 --> 42:00.996
- Thank you.

42:01.127 --> 42:03.564
May I steal him for a moment,
Mrs. Hynek?

42:03.695 --> 42:05.566
- No, you cannot.

42:05.697 --> 42:07.394
If you have something to say,
you say it to both of us.

42:10.615 --> 42:12.573
- That was my contact
at the National Guard.

42:12.704 --> 42:14.401
They found William's plane.

42:14.532 --> 42:18.144
Crashed in Mount Hood National
Forest outside of Portland.

42:18.274 --> 42:20.363
- Is William alive?

42:20.494 --> 42:22.714
- There's no sign of him.

42:22.844 --> 42:25.281
No sign of any cargo, either.

42:26.935 --> 42:29.068
Look,
I'm gonna make some calls.

42:29.198 --> 42:30.330
I'll have a private
security detail

42:30.460 --> 42:31.461
for your family
within the hour--

42:31.592 --> 42:33.333
- No.
I need to take my family home.

42:33.463 --> 42:34.987
- Doc.
- Please, trust me.

42:35.117 --> 42:36.684
William has what he wants.
He's not coming back for me.

42:36.815 --> 42:38.338
He's got his own path now.

42:39.861 --> 42:41.689
- The hell?

42:41.820 --> 42:43.909
What is all this?

42:44.039 --> 42:46.520
- Your homework, Captain.
- Right, sir, anything else?

42:46.651 --> 42:49.436
- At ease.
- That's it.

42:49.567 --> 42:51.743
- Excuse me.
- I'm sorry.

42:51.873 --> 42:53.353
I'll be after you.
- It's okay.

42:55.050 --> 42:57.662
- What's the Robertson Panel?

42:57.792 --> 42:59.838
- Seems Central
Intelligence will put

42:59.968 --> 43:02.580
the U.S. Air Force on trial.

43:02.710 --> 43:04.451
- With a full investigation
into Project Blue Book.

43:04.582 --> 43:06.496
- CIA?
They can do that?

43:06.627 --> 43:08.411
- This is a matter
of national security.

43:08.542 --> 43:09.848
They can do whatever
the hell they want.

43:09.978 --> 43:10.849
- But what's the purpose?

43:10.979 --> 43:13.591
- We're not clear on that.

43:13.721 --> 43:16.419
We brought all the files
from Project Sign and Grudge

43:16.550 --> 43:17.812
so as to be thorough.

43:17.943 --> 43:19.684
Is that understood?

43:19.814 --> 43:21.120
- Read everything you can,
fellas.

43:21.250 --> 43:22.991
We've got targets
on our backs now,

43:23.122 --> 43:24.166
so make yourselves bulletproof.

43:24.297 --> 43:26.908
Otherwise,
Blue Book is finished.
