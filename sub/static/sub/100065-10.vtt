I agree.Absolutely ridiculous.

00:14.710 --> 00:16.016
So what are we gonna do
about it?

00:16.059 --> 00:18.192
Absolutely nothing.And why is that?

00:18.235 --> 00:20.498
You know why, Anthony.
This is the new law.

00:20.542 --> 00:22.370
No bail for designated crimes.

00:22.413 --> 00:24.154
He's a burglar.
He busted right through

00:24.198 --> 00:25.329
their window.

00:25.373 --> 00:27.244
Good to see you too, Slim.Burglary

00:27.288 --> 00:28.985
being a designated crime.

00:29.029 --> 00:30.465
Cutting a lowlife
like that?

00:30.508 --> 00:31.988
That's the real crime.

00:32.032 --> 00:34.034
Yeah, maybe next time,
I hit your mama's house, Slim.

00:34.077 --> 00:35.513
Come on, come on, come on,
come on. He's just trying

00:35.557 --> 00:37.515
to bait you. Take a breath.Come on. 20 bucks

00:37.559 --> 00:39.300

to come over here

00:39.343 --> 00:41.084
and say it. Come here!Anthony!

00:41.128 --> 00:42.520
Take a breath. Will you get him

00:42.564 --> 00:44.000
out of here?Hey, you see

00:44.044 --> 00:45.219
what I'm talking about?

00:45.262 --> 00:47.264
I mean, a mope like that
belongs behind bars.

00:47.308 --> 00:50.050
State legislature says no bail,
plain and simple.

00:50.093 --> 00:51.616
We have no choice
but to abide.

00:51.660 --> 00:53.009
Yeah, well,
I'm having a real hard time

00:53.053 --> 00:54.489

00:54.532 --> 00:56.012
But you said it yourself.
He's a lowlife.

00:56.056 --> 00:58.188
He's gonna do something else,
and we'll get him on that.

00:58.232 --> 01:00.234
A-And the next time
he climbs in through some window

01:00.277 --> 01:02.279
to take the place
and there's an old lady there

01:02.323 --> 01:04.107
and he hurts her, then
what's gonna happen?

01:04.151 --> 01:07.241
The law is the law,
even if it sucks.

01:15.205 --> 01:17.468

with what you were thinking.

No better?

01:19.992 --> 01:21.559
Any worse?

01:21.603 --> 01:24.040
Well, we don't have all the
pieces yet, so no way to tell.

conduct unbecoming.

Can you tell us the nature
of this unbecoming conduct?

02:10.260 --> 02:13.611
An extramarital affair
while on duty.

a department vehicle.

02:26.233 --> 02:27.886
Isn't this Internal Affairs'
bailiwick?

02:27.930 --> 02:32.282
Internal Affairs will not be
handling this investigation.

02:32.326 --> 02:34.154
They're not?

02:34.197 --> 02:36.895
Why not? This is precisely
their purview.

02:36.939 --> 02:39.550
I know that.

04:47.722 --> 04:49.289
She stumbled in?

04:49.332 --> 04:50.812
Says she was
three sheets.

Three sheets, huh?
All right. Thanks.

No, we're members

No.

That would be
impossible.

05:23.061 --> 05:24.715
Impossible, why?

05:24.759 --> 05:27.283
Because she's a woman.

you'll offer her
membership?

Thought so.You told the officer

06:29.563 --> 06:32.217
that you witnessed
the deceased stumbling?

Uh, she appeared

that the deceased was a guest

06:55.502 --> 06:57.155

No.

07:11.039 --> 07:12.475

08:08.270 --> 08:09.706
that they're his

10:28.889 --> 10:31.718
by the blunt force trauma,
not the object that caused it.

10:31.761 --> 10:35.722
So someone could have
delivered that blow to her head?

10:35.765 --> 10:37.419
It's possible.

10:37.462 --> 10:39.421
But not likely.

10:39.464 --> 10:41.641
What is going on with you two?

10:41.684 --> 10:44.078
[sighs] My partner
is getting soft in his old age.

10:44.121 --> 10:45.732
[chuckles]: No, my
partner is letting

10:45.775 --> 10:47.298
her personal
political leanings

10:47.342 --> 10:49.561
get in the way of
her proper judgment.

10:49.605 --> 10:51.781
Come on, Danny. You know
something doesn't smell right.

10:51.825 --> 10:54.131
No, what I know is the same
thing you always tell me:

10:54.175 --> 10:56.481
a jury doesn't care about
my personal gut instinct--

10:56.525 --> 10:58.179
they care about the facts.

10:58.222 --> 10:59.310
What do you think?

10:59.354 --> 11:01.182
Did she slip, fall
and hit her head?

11:01.225 --> 11:02.705
Or did someone kill her?

11:02.749 --> 11:04.228
That is the best part
about my job--

11:04.272 --> 11:07.188
I don't think.
I just present my findings.

11:07.231 --> 11:09.190
And your findings are?

11:09.233 --> 11:12.019
Cause Undetermined
Pending Police Investigation.

11:12.062 --> 11:13.324
A CUPPI.

11:13.368 --> 11:14.717
A CUPPI.You do realize

11:14.761 --> 11:17.154
that helps us, like, zero?

11:17.198 --> 11:18.590
I do.

11:18.634 --> 11:20.636
It's a CUPPI.

11:21.637 --> 11:23.595
[sighs]

11:26.947 --> 11:28.949
It's a real honor,
you know that?

11:29.950 --> 11:31.473
What, sharing my Pringles?

11:31.516 --> 11:34.432
No, being handpicked by the
boss for this assignment.

11:34.476 --> 11:36.434
Yeah, it is.
You know
how many other cops

11:36.478 --> 11:38.436
he could've called
on for this?

11:38.480 --> 11:40.047
40,000?

11:40.090 --> 11:41.526
Yeah. Exactly.

11:41.570 --> 11:42.832
But he didn't.

11:42.876 --> 11:44.268
He picked me.

11:44.312 --> 11:45.269
Us.

11:45.313 --> 11:46.531
Right.

11:46.575 --> 11:48.533
Us.

11:49.578 --> 11:51.754
You ever step out on Sheila?

11:51.798 --> 11:53.408
You kidding?

11:53.451 --> 11:55.758
The woman's patron saint
is Lorena Bobbitt.

11:55.802 --> 11:57.238
You're a knucklehead,
you know that?

11:57.281 --> 11:59.893
Better a knucklehead
than a cliché.

11:59.936 --> 12:01.242
What's that supposed to mean?

12:01.285 --> 12:02.634
My first week on the job,

12:02.678 --> 12:04.898
I was riding
with this old hairbag,

12:04.941 --> 12:07.770
and he says to me,
"There's two things you can do

12:07.814 --> 12:09.119
"to take the edge off.

12:09.163 --> 12:11.774
"The first is to drink.

12:11.818 --> 12:14.951
The second is to get
a girl on the side."

12:14.995 --> 12:17.127
Then he turns to me, looks
me in the eye and he goes,

12:17.171 --> 12:18.346
"The smart ones

12:18.389 --> 12:20.391
end up in AA."

12:20.435 --> 12:22.306
That's super depressing.

12:22.350 --> 12:24.352
What about you
and Brian, huh?

12:24.395 --> 12:26.441
Still living
in paradise?

12:26.484 --> 12:27.790
I think so.

12:27.834 --> 12:29.400
You think so?

12:29.444 --> 12:33.317
Best part of being a cop is
almost nothing gets past you.

12:33.361 --> 12:35.842
Worst part is
your guard is always up.

12:35.885 --> 12:38.192
Your guard is up
in regard with him?

12:38.235 --> 12:39.976
It's gonna be
after working this.

12:42.022 --> 12:44.894
I get it. It's hard
not take it home.

12:46.330 --> 12:49.681
Another reason to choose to
drink instead of the goomah.

12:49.725 --> 12:51.858
Okay. Here they come.

12:53.424 --> 12:55.165
GORMLEY:
There he is.

12:55.209 --> 12:57.777
Spotless Holmes,
as promised.

12:57.820 --> 12:58.865
[shutter clicks]

12:58.908 --> 13:00.823
And...

13:00.867 --> 13:03.217
the otherwoman.[shutter clicks]

13:03.260 --> 13:06.698
[shutter clicking]

13:13.531 --> 13:16.186
Yeah. Of course I did.

13:16.230 --> 13:17.579
Do I really look like someone

13:17.622 --> 13:20.625
who-who would forget
to eat dinner?

13:20.669 --> 13:23.411
Spaghetti and white clam sauce.

13:23.454 --> 13:26.327
No, Ma, of course
it wasn't as good as yours.

13:26.370 --> 13:27.894
I'm always careful.

13:27.937 --> 13:29.243
Come on, stop.

13:29.286 --> 13:32.028
I swear on Pop, may
he rest in peace,

13:32.072 --> 13:34.335
that I will be careful.

13:34.378 --> 13:37.164
All right, you happy now?

13:37.207 --> 13:40.036
Yeah, look, Ma, I-I
got to, I got to run.

13:40.080 --> 13:42.604
No, it's nothing.
Nothing's happening.

13:43.213 --> 13:45.128
[grunts]I promise,

13:45.172 --> 13:47.174
I'm not doing
anything dangerous.

13:52.135 --> 13:54.921
Now what was that you
said about my mother?

13:57.532 --> 13:59.273
Aw, come on, Slim.

13:59.316 --> 14:00.796
What, you're not
happy to see me?

14:02.798 --> 14:04.974
[grunting]

14:05.018 --> 14:07.063
Turn around,
you piece of garbage.

14:07.107 --> 14:08.630
You got the right
to remain silent.

14:08.673 --> 14:11.415
Anything you say may be used
against you in a court of law.

14:11.459 --> 14:13.722
Come on. Come
on, Thurgood.

14:17.987 --> 14:20.250
Here you go.Thanks.

14:20.294 --> 14:22.557
Ta-da.What isthis?

14:22.600 --> 14:25.603
Well, the guys made a Castle
run, so I got you some.

14:25.647 --> 14:26.996
You did?
Yep.

14:27.040 --> 14:28.432
I love White Castle.

14:28.476 --> 14:30.565
I know you do.

14:30.608 --> 14:33.655
By the way, something big
just happened to come up.

14:33.698 --> 14:34.917
Triple homicide uptown.

14:34.961 --> 14:36.397
We're still
working thiscase.

14:36.440 --> 14:38.921
Well, I mean, we're
crossing T's and dotting I's

14:38.965 --> 14:42.446
on this case. But they could
really use our help uptown.

14:42.490 --> 14:44.361
You game?

14:44.405 --> 14:46.407
This cheeseburger's
a bribe, isn't it?

14:46.450 --> 14:48.278
Absolutely not.

14:48.322 --> 14:51.064
Wow. Did your voice
just go high on that?

14:51.107 --> 14:54.502
Come on, Baez.
You heard the M.E.

14:54.545 --> 14:56.591
The-the, the case
is a CUPPI.

14:56.634 --> 14:58.114
Which means
we have no reason to believe

14:58.158 --> 15:01.074
it's anything other than
what the eyewitness says it is.

15:01.117 --> 15:02.423
An unfortunate accident.

15:02.466 --> 15:04.120
[clears throat]

15:04.164 --> 15:06.296
How many times do
we follow your gut?

15:06.340 --> 15:08.472
[sighs]

15:08.516 --> 15:10.561
Okay, fine.
I'll work with you on this.

15:10.605 --> 15:12.650
But you got to give me
something more than the fact

15:12.694 --> 15:14.304
that you don't like these people

15:14.348 --> 15:16.393
because they don't allow women
into the club.

15:16.437 --> 15:17.699
Okay.

15:17.742 --> 15:20.441
How many people do you
know in this day and age

15:20.484 --> 15:22.399
that leave their house
without a cell phone?

15:22.443 --> 15:24.401
You heard
Frick and Frack.

15:24.445 --> 15:25.925
They didn't bring
their cell phones

15:25.968 --> 15:27.622
because they're not allowed
in the club.

15:27.665 --> 15:29.232
I'm talking about
the deceased.

15:29.276 --> 15:31.887
She didn't have
a cell phone on her, either?

15:31.931 --> 15:34.107
She didn't just stumble
in off the street.

15:34.150 --> 15:36.718
She knew exactly
where she was going,

15:36.761 --> 15:40.374
and that she couldn't bring
her cell phone with her.

15:42.071 --> 15:43.072
Oh.

15:44.726 --> 15:46.380
[slurping]

15:52.255 --> 15:53.822
GORMLEY:
TARU's got a discreet
way to run her mug

15:53.865 --> 15:55.084
through the facial
recognition software.

15:55.128 --> 15:57.652
For?

15:59.393 --> 16:01.090
Well, her identity. We
should know who she is.

16:01.134 --> 16:05.486
Sid's right. We should
be able to verify her identity.

16:07.618 --> 16:11.579
But Abigail,
you already know who she is.

16:12.623 --> 16:14.669
What's going on?

16:14.712 --> 16:17.280
Ay... how long we been?

16:19.065 --> 16:21.415
You know her?

16:21.458 --> 16:23.765
Lorraine Burch.

16:23.808 --> 16:26.072
We used to work together
in the 2-2.

16:28.074 --> 16:30.946
GORMLEY:
She's on the job?

16:30.990 --> 16:33.688
Was.
Retired to the private sector.

16:33.731 --> 16:35.081
Now she works for a law firm.

16:35.124 --> 16:36.517
Why didn't you tell
me on the day?

16:36.560 --> 16:37.953
Not my place.

16:37.997 --> 16:39.041
So she's not a cop anymore.

16:39.085 --> 16:40.260
Makes things simpler.

16:40.303 --> 16:41.522
Actually, no.

16:41.565 --> 16:42.827
Why "no"?

16:42.871 --> 16:44.612
Only oneof ours
is involved, not two.

16:44.655 --> 16:49.486
Lorraine has been married to
Inspector Jack Burch. For years.

16:51.271 --> 16:54.274
Okay.Of all our chiefs,

16:54.317 --> 16:56.102
Burch of
Counterterrorism

16:56.145 --> 16:59.061
is the one who's...Is utterly indispensable.

16:59.105 --> 17:01.107
This entire city
needs him on his game

17:01.150 --> 17:03.457
every hour that God sends.

17:03.500 --> 17:05.937
Okay, this is enough
of a pickle without...Okay.

17:05.981 --> 17:08.723
You're right. There are people
who could replace him.

17:08.766 --> 17:10.290
There are alwayspeople...Only they work

17:10.333 --> 17:13.293
for Mossad or MI-5 and have
never set foot in this building.

17:13.336 --> 17:14.903
What if
they're separated?

17:14.946 --> 17:16.165
Getting divorced?

17:16.209 --> 17:18.124
For all we know,
Burch has a girl of his own.

17:18.167 --> 17:19.908
For all we know,
a job that stressful,

17:19.951 --> 17:23.303
he may tether his sanity
to a happy home life.

17:23.346 --> 17:25.696
I'll just shut up
from here on in.

17:25.740 --> 17:27.481
No, you got a point.

17:27.524 --> 17:29.744
We need more information.

17:33.530 --> 17:37.230
We need all the information
we can get.

17:50.243 --> 17:52.071
[doorbell rings]

17:55.726 --> 17:58.642
Detective Reagan.
My partner, Detective Baez.

17:58.686 --> 18:00.688
We need to speak
with Albert Becker.

18:00.731 --> 18:03.169
My husband?Right here, Colleen
I got it.

18:03.212 --> 18:04.735
Albert?
Is everything okay?

18:04.779 --> 18:07.042
Just fine.
Nothing to worry about.

18:08.609 --> 18:10.437
What are you doing here?

18:10.480 --> 18:11.829
You're not gonna
invite us in?

18:11.873 --> 18:13.962
It's not that.
My wife is the nervous type.

18:14.005 --> 18:15.703
Police show up unannounced,
she starts to worry.

18:15.746 --> 18:17.139
Your wife has nothing
to worry about.

18:17.183 --> 18:18.706
We just wanted to ask you
a few questions

18:18.749 --> 18:20.490
about the testimony
you gave to us yesterday.

18:20.534 --> 18:23.102
Testimony?Mm-hm.
The statement you made?

18:23.145 --> 18:25.365
You know, the woman
stumbled into the club,

18:25.408 --> 18:26.670
lost her footing,

18:26.714 --> 18:28.498
and cracked open her head
on the marble.

18:28.542 --> 18:30.065
Yes, what about it?

18:30.109 --> 18:32.154
Well, we're wondering if there's
anything you wanted to add,

18:32.198 --> 18:34.765
or anything you might've
forgotten about what happened.

18:34.809 --> 18:36.463
No. I don't think so.

18:36.506 --> 18:38.029
Or subtract anything?

18:38.073 --> 18:39.248
Subtract?

18:39.292 --> 18:40.771
It's just that it's
really important

18:40.815 --> 18:43.557
that we get clarity because
whatever we put down today

18:43.600 --> 18:46.429
will serve as the permanent
record. You understand?

18:46.473 --> 18:48.910
Any adjustments you make
moving forward

18:48.953 --> 18:51.042
will be viewed
as contradictory statements.DANNY: Mm-hmm.

18:51.086 --> 18:52.740
[exhales]

18:52.783 --> 18:55.960
Albert?
Is everything okay?

18:56.004 --> 18:57.614
Everything's fine, Colleen.
I'll be right in.

18:57.658 --> 19:00.574
You do understand
the consequences for lying

19:00.617 --> 19:02.184
to police officers,
don't you, Albert?

19:02.228 --> 19:03.620
BAEZ: Hindering
prosecution?

19:03.664 --> 19:05.492
Tampering with evidence?

19:05.535 --> 19:08.277
Albert! What in the world
have you gotten into?

19:08.321 --> 19:10.105
Colleen, please.

19:10.149 --> 19:11.715
BAEZ:
Mr. Becker,

19:11.759 --> 19:13.282
perhaps you should retain
a lawyer.

19:13.326 --> 19:14.588
A lawyer?

19:14.631 --> 19:16.938
Albert, what is going on here?Colleen,

19:16.981 --> 19:18.548
go inside.

19:24.293 --> 19:26.208
I have to go. May I go?

19:26.252 --> 19:29.168
Yes, Albert.
Go inside.

19:32.997 --> 19:35.391
Think we got him
on the ropes.

19:35.435 --> 19:37.219
Yeah. And now
we're gonna

19:37.263 --> 19:40.048
let the wife deliver
the knockout punch for us.

19:40.091 --> 19:41.223
Can't wait.

19:43.094 --> 19:45.314
[elevator bell dings]

19:51.973 --> 19:54.889
Top of the
morning to you!Mary and Joseph,

19:54.932 --> 19:56.586
you want to give me a coronary?

19:56.630 --> 19:57.805
I'm sorry, did
I surprise you?

19:57.848 --> 19:59.937
Yeah, you did.
Lurking behind the cabinet

19:59.981 --> 20:01.200
like some kind of lurker.

20:01.243 --> 20:02.679
You mean stalking.
I think that's the word

20:02.723 --> 20:03.898
you're looking for.

20:03.941 --> 20:06.640
Yeah. Exactly.
Like some kind of stalker.

20:06.683 --> 20:08.685
Like what you did to
Thurgood last night.

20:08.729 --> 20:10.426
Did you think you
were really gonna go

20:10.470 --> 20:13.473
Charles Bronson on me, and I
wouldn't find out about it?

20:13.516 --> 20:15.257
I did not go Charles Bronson.

20:15.301 --> 20:17.651
You camped out in his
neighborhood, staked him out,

20:17.694 --> 20:20.175
and then pounced on him the
second he tried to do something.

20:20.219 --> 20:22.003
Yeah, which took him
all of 20 minutes.

20:22.046 --> 20:24.310
Proof positive
he's the animal I said he was.

20:24.353 --> 20:25.702
And for all
that trouble,

20:25.746 --> 20:27.791
you arrested him on
attempted grand larceny?

20:27.835 --> 20:29.097
A misdemeanor?

20:29.140 --> 20:31.839
So, he's gonna be cut
loose this afternoon,

20:31.882 --> 20:33.319
just like he was
the other day.

20:33.362 --> 20:34.320
That's not the point.

20:34.363 --> 20:35.451
No, it's not.

20:35.495 --> 20:37.845
The point is, what you did

20:37.888 --> 20:40.369
was waste this
department's resources.

20:40.413 --> 20:42.153
You do it again,

20:42.197 --> 20:44.243
and I won't sign off
on your overtime.

20:44.286 --> 20:47.507
You think I care about overtime?

20:47.550 --> 20:50.292
No, I don't. I know
what you care about, Anthony.

20:50.336 --> 20:52.338
And I'm with you.
But you have to understand

20:52.381 --> 20:54.470
you work for this office,
and when you work,

20:54.514 --> 20:56.385
it has to be in line
with its principles.

20:56.429 --> 20:58.344
What the hell is that
supposed to mean?

20:58.387 --> 21:02.043
It means what you did was not
in the spirit of the law.

21:02.086 --> 21:04.350
Even if
you despise the law,

21:04.393 --> 21:05.916
you still need to respect it.

21:05.960 --> 21:07.309
Yeah, well, the way I see it,

21:07.353 --> 21:10.181
my job is to protect
the people of this city.

21:10.225 --> 21:12.836
Not again. Promise.

21:14.664 --> 21:17.014
I swear on Pop's grave,
may he rest in peace.

21:19.365 --> 21:20.801
Anthony.Kidding.

21:20.844 --> 21:22.498
I'm kidding, I'm joking.

21:32.073 --> 21:33.466
Dry cleaning.

21:33.509 --> 21:36.469
The, uh, framed pictures
from the art store.

21:36.512 --> 21:38.993
Spare keys you were
asking about.

21:39.036 --> 21:40.386
And I talked
to the super about

21:40.429 --> 21:41.561
that back burner
that's been out.

21:41.604 --> 21:42.736
He's gonna fix it
this weekend.

21:42.779 --> 21:44.694
So...

21:44.738 --> 21:45.869
Wow.

21:45.913 --> 21:48.176
Someone's been busy.

21:48.219 --> 21:49.743
Tell Freud he can go
tell it on the mountain.

21:49.786 --> 21:52.398
Except for you did
just prove his point.

21:52.441 --> 21:54.313
All right, here we go.
[chuckles]

21:54.356 --> 21:56.010
You know what,
don't worry about it.

21:56.053 --> 21:58.186
Thank you very much,
I really appreciate all this.Oh, no, no.

21:58.229 --> 21:59.622
I want to-- I want to hear

21:59.666 --> 22:01.842
how I proved his point.Well, you know what,

22:01.885 --> 22:03.365
I'm late for roll call, so...No.

22:03.409 --> 22:04.410
Over my dead body.
Come on.

22:04.453 --> 22:05.759
You know-- Okay, fine.

22:05.802 --> 22:07.500
Someone might look
at all this

22:07.543 --> 22:09.110
and say that you're
overcompensating.

22:09.153 --> 22:10.590
Overcompensating?

22:10.633 --> 22:12.331
Th-This is great.

22:12.374 --> 22:14.289
So if I don't do the list,
I'm a misogynist,

22:14.333 --> 22:15.769
but when I do do the list,

22:15.812 --> 22:17.423
then I'm overcompensating?

22:17.466 --> 22:19.512
Which one is it?Both.

22:19.555 --> 22:20.513
It can't be both.

22:20.556 --> 22:22.689
Sure it can,
because it's both.

22:22.732 --> 22:25.256
How?
How?

22:25.300 --> 22:27.433
Because you went so far
out of your way

22:27.476 --> 22:30.131
to do all this stuff,
to prove that I was wrong

22:30.174 --> 22:33.439
that you were uncomfortable
taking direction from a woman,

22:33.482 --> 22:36.442
you just proved I was right.

22:36.485 --> 22:37.704
You're officially insane.

22:37.747 --> 22:39.923
I'm insane?
Why don't you think about it?

22:39.967 --> 22:42.099
A part of you
must have thought

22:42.143 --> 22:43.623
that I was right
in the first place,

22:43.666 --> 22:45.407
or you wouldn't have worked
so hard to do all this stuff

22:45.451 --> 22:47.322
to prove I was wrong.I, honestly,

22:47.366 --> 22:49.063
I can't even think
straight anymore. I'm...

22:49.106 --> 22:50.151
Oh, okay, well, good--
The good news--

22:50.194 --> 22:51.152
The good news is that

22:51.195 --> 22:53.981
none of this is your fault.

22:54.024 --> 22:56.940
So you get to go home,
get some rest.

22:56.984 --> 22:57.941
I'm gonna go to work.

22:57.985 --> 22:59.421
Wait, whose fault is it?

22:59.465 --> 23:02.859
Your father, your grandfather,
and a little bit Danny.

23:09.910 --> 23:10.867
[school bell ringing]Okay.

23:10.911 --> 23:12.260
Daddy!

23:12.303 --> 23:14.828
Hey, buddy, how you doing?

23:14.871 --> 23:16.482
DANNY: Frick Abbot!How was school?

23:16.525 --> 23:18.353
Hey, remember us?

23:18.397 --> 23:20.094
Detectives, can I help you?

23:20.137 --> 23:23.184
Actually, you can.
Thank you for offering.

23:23.227 --> 23:25.665
Right. Sure.

23:25.708 --> 23:28.102
Wesley, go hang out
with Gregory, okay?

23:28.145 --> 23:29.538
Okay.I'll be right there.

23:30.887 --> 23:32.062
This will just
take a second.

23:32.106 --> 23:34.021
You know, actually,
this is my kid's school.

23:34.064 --> 23:36.023
Can we-- Can we do this
another time?

23:36.066 --> 23:37.067
BAEZ:
It sure is.

23:37.111 --> 23:38.286
All-boys school?

23:38.329 --> 23:41.245
Look, I'm with my son.
Can we meet later?

23:41.289 --> 23:43.770
Like my partner said,
it'll just take a few minutes.

23:43.813 --> 23:46.903
Okay. Uh,
but if you can, be quick.

23:46.947 --> 23:50.516
Okay. We were wondering why
Albert Becker called you

23:50.559 --> 23:51.865
this morning right after
we spoke to him.

23:51.908 --> 23:54.171
What?
Yeah.

23:54.215 --> 23:55.564
I-I don't know.

23:55.608 --> 23:57.392
You were on the phone
with him for five minutes.

23:57.436 --> 23:59.960
Uh...It must have been
pretty urgent.

24:00.003 --> 24:03.050
I mean, he literally
wasted no time in calling you.

24:03.093 --> 24:05.487
Something tells me you two don't
shoot the breeze very often.

24:05.531 --> 24:07.010
What'd you two talk about?

24:07.054 --> 24:09.926
Dad?I-I'll be right there.

24:09.970 --> 24:11.624
Can we please
do this another time?

24:11.667 --> 24:12.668
It's a simple question.

24:12.712 --> 24:14.844
You answer it,
we'll be on our way.

24:14.888 --> 24:17.630
Okay, I don't like
the way this is going.

24:17.673 --> 24:19.022
I don't like the way this feels.

24:19.066 --> 24:20.763
How's it feel, Frick?

24:20.807 --> 24:22.809
You know what?

24:22.852 --> 24:24.593
I would like to speak
to my attorney.

24:24.637 --> 24:25.942
That's your prerogative.

24:25.986 --> 24:29.380
Wesley, let's go.

24:36.953 --> 24:38.955
You gonna dig that out
of the garbage, or am I?

24:40.348 --> 24:42.437
I'll do it.

24:52.665 --> 24:54.493
Good morning, Colleen.

24:54.536 --> 24:56.930
I can't talk to you.

24:56.973 --> 24:58.235
Is that what
your husband said?

24:58.279 --> 24:59.541
He didn't have to.

24:59.585 --> 25:00.977
I'm smart enough
to figure that out on my own.

25:01.021 --> 25:03.414
Smart enough to make him
call Frick Abbott

25:03.458 --> 25:05.939
to get out of this mess, too.

25:05.982 --> 25:07.941
I don't know what
you're talking about.

25:07.984 --> 25:09.116
Sure you do.

25:09.159 --> 25:11.118
Just like you know
everything that goes on

25:11.161 --> 25:12.772
at that Bones Club,
but without your husband

25:12.815 --> 25:14.469
ever having to say a word.

25:14.513 --> 25:16.166
I think I left the oven on.

25:16.210 --> 25:17.646
Have a nice day.

25:19.474 --> 25:21.041
This is Frick Abbott's
coffee cup

25:21.084 --> 25:22.651
with his fingerprints
all over it.

25:22.695 --> 25:26.307
Same fingerprints that were
found on the deceased's ankles.

25:26.350 --> 25:28.091
I don't know what that means.

25:28.135 --> 25:30.354
It means your husband
just bought himself

25:30.398 --> 25:33.140
a one-way ticket
to the grand jury.

25:36.012 --> 25:38.493
She said everything was
great with her marriage.

25:38.537 --> 25:39.668
And you bought it?

25:41.670 --> 25:43.454
She actually said that?

25:43.498 --> 25:45.500
Well, not in so many words,
but she spoke about the future

25:45.544 --> 25:47.502
the way you do when
you're happily married.

25:47.546 --> 25:49.330
And how's that?

25:49.373 --> 25:51.419
I'm curious what
that sounds like.

25:51.462 --> 25:54.161
She got him a new set
of golf clubs for Christmas.

25:54.204 --> 25:57.338
They found a house at
Point Lookout for a steal,

25:57.381 --> 25:58.687
his blood pressure's
under control.

25:58.731 --> 26:02.517
Wow. Don't you think
it would be useful

26:02.561 --> 26:04.519
for me to talk to Lorraine?

26:04.563 --> 26:05.868
As what?

26:05.912 --> 26:07.827
As a rightly concerned
third party

26:07.870 --> 26:09.742
with a big stake in the outcome.

26:09.785 --> 26:12.048
No.I asked her.

26:12.092 --> 26:13.702
And I'm telling you that could
blow up in your face.

26:13.746 --> 26:15.008
I can't answer that.

26:15.051 --> 26:17.227
As a police matter.It's not gonna play

26:17.271 --> 26:18.533
as a police matter to her,

26:18.577 --> 26:19.882
except maybe as intimidation,

26:19.926 --> 26:21.623
and we're not that kind
of police.

26:21.667 --> 26:23.799
I'm not interested
in persuading her

26:23.843 --> 26:25.366
one way or the other.

26:25.409 --> 26:27.673
I simply want
to give her the opportunity

26:27.716 --> 26:30.719
to soft-land this situation
with her husband,

26:30.763 --> 26:32.721
who just happens to be

26:32.765 --> 26:35.594
one of this city's
most valuable assets.

26:35.637 --> 26:38.597
Boss, maybe it's best you
just deal with Chief Holmes.

26:38.640 --> 26:40.207
Show him the pics,
pull his stars,

26:40.250 --> 26:42.644
and let the chips fall
where they may.

26:42.688 --> 26:44.646
And open another can of worms.You don't know that.

26:44.690 --> 26:45.952
Rumors fly through
this department

26:45.995 --> 26:47.693
faster than
a high school cafeteria.

26:47.736 --> 26:49.651
The question of the day
is gonna be,

26:49.695 --> 26:52.045
"What did Holmes do
to lose his stars?"

26:52.088 --> 26:54.264
You can't just let
the chief of IAB

26:54.308 --> 26:55.657
get away with
something like that.

26:55.701 --> 26:57.180
What message does that send?

26:57.224 --> 26:58.486
Sid's right.

26:58.529 --> 27:00.401
Plus, whoever tipped this thing

27:00.444 --> 27:03.970
in the first place is watching.

27:04.013 --> 27:06.537
Which brings us back
to Lorraine Burch.

27:06.581 --> 27:10.672
I can say she has nothing
but respect for this department.

27:10.716 --> 27:12.369
And shows it door-to-door.

27:12.413 --> 27:14.807
And that she'd want
to protect this department.

27:14.850 --> 27:16.330
Here's the thing.

27:16.373 --> 27:18.898
She hasn't committed a crime.

27:18.941 --> 27:21.770
Her private life is not
your police business.

27:21.814 --> 27:24.643
You saying it is
won't make it so.

27:26.775 --> 27:28.995
I disagree.

27:39.483 --> 27:42.138
Three against one.

27:44.358 --> 27:46.273
So be it.

27:50.451 --> 27:53.236
Colleen, you home?

27:53.280 --> 27:54.847
In here, Albert.

27:59.242 --> 28:00.548
Colleen, what are you doing?

28:00.591 --> 28:02.942
Don't worry,
she didn't say a word.

28:02.985 --> 28:04.857
Albert, you need
to talk to them.

28:04.900 --> 28:06.728
I've already said enough.

28:06.772 --> 28:08.469
Please, leave my home.

28:08.512 --> 28:10.645
We'll leave.
And you're coming with us.

28:10.689 --> 28:12.168
To the grand jury.

28:12.212 --> 28:14.388
We found Frick Abbott's
fingerprints on the deceased.

28:14.431 --> 28:16.477
You told us
nobody touched her.

28:16.520 --> 28:18.653
You said she fell and
hit her head. Remember?

28:18.697 --> 28:20.220
BAEZ: We subpoenaed
your phone records

28:20.263 --> 28:22.483
after we left here
the other day.

28:22.526 --> 28:24.311
He was your first phone call.

28:24.354 --> 28:25.791
Talking to Frick to get
your stories straight?

28:25.834 --> 28:27.662
Is that the plan, Albert?

28:27.706 --> 28:30.056
Albert, I know you.
You're a good man.

28:30.099 --> 28:32.798
I know you would
never harm anyone.

28:32.841 --> 28:36.845
Whatever happened,
it's time to tell the police.

28:36.889 --> 28:39.761
BAEZ:
We already have you
for perjury, Albert.

28:39.805 --> 28:42.329
It's starting to look like
tampering with evidence

28:42.372 --> 28:44.157
and accessory to murder.

28:44.200 --> 28:46.550
Oh, my God.

28:46.594 --> 28:48.074
Be the first one to talk to us.

28:48.117 --> 28:49.989
I guarantee you
one of them will.

28:50.032 --> 28:52.208
DANNY: Come on, we're trying
to help you out here, Albert.

28:52.252 --> 28:54.776
You really think those rich guys
are gonna have your back?

28:54.820 --> 28:58.954
Albert, please,
tell them what happened.

29:03.263 --> 29:05.874
[takes deep breath]

29:05.918 --> 29:10.531
Well, that was a very
merry Christmas party.

29:10.574 --> 29:13.360
Very merry.

29:13.403 --> 29:16.406
You okay?
You're not saying much.

29:16.450 --> 29:20.236
My father, my grandfather,
and a little bit Danny.

29:20.280 --> 29:21.585
What is that, a riddle?

29:21.629 --> 29:24.371
What, like, they all walk
into a bar or something?

29:24.414 --> 29:26.939
That's what you said to me.
Or did you forget?

29:26.982 --> 29:28.810
Oh, that.

29:28.854 --> 29:30.899
Yeah, that.

29:30.943 --> 29:33.032
Well, I shouldn't
have said that.

29:33.075 --> 29:35.730
I'm-- I didn't mean it,

29:35.774 --> 29:38.124
and I'm-- It wasn't nice.

29:38.167 --> 29:40.126
Not nice?

29:40.169 --> 29:42.519
I don't even know
what it means.

29:42.563 --> 29:44.347
I don't know what a lot
of the stuff you say

29:44.391 --> 29:45.435
these days means.

29:45.479 --> 29:47.263
It's just I don't like
that we are just

29:47.307 --> 29:49.918
two ships passing
in the night every night.

29:51.485 --> 29:53.443
So this is you
picking a fight?

29:53.487 --> 29:56.403
No, this is me getting worried.About what?

29:56.446 --> 29:58.622
Do you realize that
we are the only couple

29:58.666 --> 30:00.363
in your entire family?

30:00.407 --> 30:01.756
That's not true.

30:01.800 --> 30:03.323
Yes. Your dad, your grandpa,

30:03.366 --> 30:04.541
your brother,
they're all widowers.

30:04.585 --> 30:08.067
And your sister is divorced.

30:08.110 --> 30:09.895
Okay, but they all
weremarried.

30:09.938 --> 30:11.592
Like a hundred years ago.

30:11.635 --> 30:12.680
Eddie, what's your point?

30:12.723 --> 30:14.203
It's just I don't--

30:14.247 --> 30:17.598
Everybody in your family
is good on their own.

30:17.641 --> 30:20.079
And they're all really good
at being alone.

30:20.122 --> 30:21.732
And I worry.

30:21.776 --> 30:23.909
I don't want that.

30:23.952 --> 30:26.041
I want to be your teammate.

30:26.085 --> 30:29.653
This is all because I called it
a "honey do" list, isn't it?

30:29.697 --> 30:31.394
Yep.

30:31.438 --> 30:33.483
And I'm the crazy one?

30:33.527 --> 30:37.183
I know. I'm sorry.

30:37.226 --> 30:38.488
I'm sorry.

30:38.532 --> 30:40.882
No. I am.

30:40.926 --> 30:43.624
And I know just how
to make it up to you.

30:43.667 --> 30:45.844
How?

30:47.193 --> 30:48.977
By giving you this.

30:50.544 --> 30:54.417
A honey do list? Ooh...

30:56.028 --> 30:58.900
You realize number three
is illegal in some states?

30:58.944 --> 31:00.902
Not in New York City.

31:00.946 --> 31:03.862
[laughing]:
Oh, my God.

31:05.515 --> 31:06.908
[beeps]

31:06.952 --> 31:09.693
When the members wish to
partake in mixed company,

31:09.737 --> 31:13.001
they send me on an errand
to the pantry or the stock room.

31:13.045 --> 31:15.177
You mean when they want to bring
girls into the club.

31:15.221 --> 31:17.397
DANNY: They pull
you off the desk

31:17.440 --> 31:19.616
so you can look
the other way?

31:19.660 --> 31:21.183
Precisely.

31:21.227 --> 31:22.924
Did you see the deceased
enter the club?

31:24.360 --> 31:26.362
[sighs]

31:26.406 --> 31:28.147
I did not.

31:28.190 --> 31:30.192
And you didn't observe her
slip and fall?

31:30.236 --> 31:32.673
No.

31:32.716 --> 31:34.631
When did you first see her?

31:34.675 --> 31:38.331
After Frick and Brooks
carried her down the stairs

31:38.374 --> 31:42.161
and placed her on the marble
floor of the foyer.

31:42.204 --> 31:45.991
And was she still alive then?

31:46.034 --> 31:47.993
ALBERT:
No.

31:48.036 --> 31:50.691
[sniffles]

31:50.734 --> 31:53.389
She was dead.

31:55.348 --> 31:57.698
Got any rules against
moving dead bodies around

31:57.741 --> 31:59.047
in your fancy
Bones Club?

31:59.091 --> 32:00.309
Or how about a rule against

32:00.353 --> 32:02.355
tampering with
physical evidence, hmm?

32:04.400 --> 32:05.836
Hindering
prosecution?

32:07.708 --> 32:09.144
Murder?

32:13.105 --> 32:15.542
It wasn't me.

32:15.585 --> 32:16.543
It was Frick.

32:16.586 --> 32:19.024
Hmm. Okay, Frack.

32:19.067 --> 32:20.982
[notepad hits desk]You're gonna write that down,

32:21.026 --> 32:22.592
every single word of that.

32:22.636 --> 32:25.334
[pen clicks]Have a seat.

32:38.521 --> 32:40.262
ABETEMARCO:
Ah, let me guess,

32:40.306 --> 32:41.742
you're moonlighting
as Santa Claus?

32:41.785 --> 32:44.353
Come on, Slim, why the hell
you always sweating me?

32:44.397 --> 32:45.572
You know, I'm not sure.

32:45.615 --> 32:47.226
Maybe because your material
is so stale.

32:47.269 --> 32:48.749
You know, I'm "Slim"

32:48.792 --> 32:51.230
because I ain't slim.
I mean, seriously?

32:51.273 --> 32:53.406
This is entrapment, bro.
You can't keep doing this.

32:53.449 --> 32:55.930
But then maybe again
it's because you're a lowlife

32:55.974 --> 32:57.366
that belongs
behind bars,

32:57.410 --> 33:00.326
and not only can I do it,
I'm gonna keep on doing it.

33:01.457 --> 33:03.198
You scumbag.

33:22.739 --> 33:24.959
[screams, grunts]

33:27.309 --> 33:29.703
Any more smart
remarks, Thurgood?

33:33.707 --> 33:35.013
[grunts]

33:35.578 --> 33:37.537
[groans]

33:46.546 --> 33:47.982
[elevator bell dings]

33:48.026 --> 33:49.157
Detective...

33:49.201 --> 33:51.203
Detective Abetemarco?

33:56.034 --> 33:57.644
Anthony?

33:57.687 --> 34:00.038
What are you doing here?What do you mean,
what am I doing here?

34:00.081 --> 34:01.648
I got a call that you were shot.

34:01.691 --> 34:02.997
Oh, yeah, that.

34:03.041 --> 34:04.477
"Oh, yeah, that?"

34:04.520 --> 34:06.044
No biggie.
Everything's fine.

34:06.087 --> 34:08.959
What do you, what do you mean
everything's fine?

34:09.003 --> 34:11.962
Come on, you really think, uh,
I'd let a couple of bullets

34:12.006 --> 34:13.312
get to me?

34:13.355 --> 34:15.531
They bounce right off me.
I'm a superhero.

34:15.575 --> 34:18.273
What the hell
are you talking about?

34:18.317 --> 34:22.147
I'm kidding. It was my vest.
It saved my life.

34:22.190 --> 34:25.019
[sighs]Yeah, one just missed my heart.

34:25.063 --> 34:26.542
There but for the grace of God.

34:26.586 --> 34:29.067
So you're okay?

34:29.110 --> 34:32.113
Except for a couple of black and
blues that'll blow your mind.

34:32.157 --> 34:33.941
Are they bigger than this one?

34:33.984 --> 34:35.290
Ow!
Or this one?

34:35.334 --> 34:37.379
What's that?What the hell is wrong with you?

34:37.423 --> 34:38.467
What the hell were you doing?Why are you doing...

34:38.511 --> 34:40.295
I told you to stay away
from there.

34:40.339 --> 34:42.123
I told you to stand down.I'm sorry.

34:42.167 --> 34:44.299
You're sorry.
Am I crazy?

34:44.343 --> 34:45.866
Giving me a heart attack.I'm sorry.

34:45.909 --> 34:47.650
Sorry.

34:47.694 --> 34:48.999
I'm sorry.

34:49.043 --> 34:51.176
Geez.

34:55.441 --> 34:56.703
Chief Holmes.

34:56.746 --> 34:59.053
Got a second?
For?

34:59.097 --> 35:01.751
P.C. wants to chat.

35:16.114 --> 35:18.855
The affair ends now.

35:18.899 --> 35:22.555
If there are loose ends, use
all your skills to tie them up,

35:22.598 --> 35:24.818
like it never happened.

35:26.341 --> 35:28.038
Um, then what?

35:28.082 --> 35:30.911
Neither did this conversation.

35:47.101 --> 35:49.147
Thanks.

35:49.190 --> 35:52.889
Where you going,
Brooks?

35:52.933 --> 35:54.369
Detective.

35:54.413 --> 35:56.937
You, get your ass
in the car and stay there.

35:56.980 --> 35:59.200
What's wrong, Brooks?
You look surprised to see me.

35:59.244 --> 36:00.375
Hi, Brooks.

36:00.419 --> 36:02.247
Oh, no.

36:02.290 --> 36:03.900
Did I mess up?

36:03.944 --> 36:05.554
Are girls not allowed
on the plane?

36:05.598 --> 36:08.557
Look, I was just heading out of
town on a quick business trip.

36:08.601 --> 36:10.603
Says here you're off
to the Maldives.

36:10.646 --> 36:12.039
Yeah, one of the few countries

36:12.082 --> 36:14.868
without an extradition treaty
with the U.S.

36:14.911 --> 36:17.349
What a coincidence.And there's no return date.

36:17.392 --> 36:19.829
Look, I can explain.You know, if I
didn't know better,

36:19.873 --> 36:23.093
Brooks, I'd swear you were
trying to skip town.

36:23.137 --> 36:26.488
Which doesn't really make sense
since you're hardly in trouble.

36:26.532 --> 36:28.751
It was Frick that killed
that poor girl by accident,

36:28.795 --> 36:30.013
that's what you told us, right?

36:30.057 --> 36:31.319
Yes, and it's true.

36:31.363 --> 36:33.060
And we believed you.

36:33.103 --> 36:35.367
That is, until we went
to pick up Frick and, well,

36:35.410 --> 36:37.847
he shared a little
surprise with us.

36:37.891 --> 36:40.981
See, Frick was a bad boy,
he snuck his cell phone

36:41.024 --> 36:42.852
into the club the night
you killed your date.

36:42.896 --> 36:44.898
Wait a second.And it's a good thing he did

36:44.941 --> 36:47.596
'cause he played a little
recording of you telling him

36:47.640 --> 36:49.250
how you accidentally
killed that girl

36:49.294 --> 36:52.906
and that you needed his help to
bring her dead body downstairs.

36:52.949 --> 36:55.256
BAEZ: We played it for
the district attorney's office

36:55.300 --> 36:56.562
this morning.

36:56.605 --> 36:57.954
They'd like a word with you.

36:57.998 --> 36:59.956
That's another way of saying
you're under arrest.

37:00.000 --> 37:01.393
BAEZ: Don't worry,
there won't be

37:01.436 --> 37:03.786
any girls in your cell,
only men,

37:03.830 --> 37:05.179
just the way you like it.

37:06.572 --> 37:08.574
Yup.

37:17.844 --> 37:19.585
Yes, Baker?

37:19.628 --> 37:21.282
Unless there's anything
you need,

37:21.326 --> 37:22.805
we're taking off
for the weekend.

37:22.849 --> 37:25.243
Okay.

37:37.994 --> 37:39.953
Have a good one.
See you on Monday.

37:39.996 --> 37:41.607
A good weekend
in the dark?

37:41.650 --> 37:44.000
I think I have
a right to know.I'm good.

37:44.044 --> 37:45.698
Sid.GARRETT: Hold on.

37:53.183 --> 37:55.969
A want is not a right.

37:56.012 --> 37:57.666
Okay, I want to know,

37:57.710 --> 38:00.321
in case she reaches out,
off all the sudden shuffling.

38:00.365 --> 38:02.192
What sudden shuffling?

38:02.236 --> 38:04.499
Well, Chief Holmes
losing his stars?

38:04.543 --> 38:06.675
Not on my watch.

38:06.719 --> 38:08.286
Wait, he isn't?

38:08.329 --> 38:11.158
Well, see, the IAB Chief and I

38:11.201 --> 38:14.161
had a brief discussion,

38:14.204 --> 38:17.947
and he is losing her number,
and that is all,

38:17.991 --> 38:20.950
and everybody is agreeing that
none of this ever happened.

38:20.994 --> 38:22.256
So a cover-up?

38:22.300 --> 38:26.042
I prefer to think of it
as reverse engineering.

38:26.086 --> 38:28.784
What about the cop who blew the
whistle? Is he in on it, too?

38:28.828 --> 38:32.353
I don't think so.

38:32.397 --> 38:34.790
And his initial complaint
didn't bear fruit,

38:34.834 --> 38:36.531
so, hopefully,

38:36.575 --> 38:40.361
if he doubles back,
he doesn't find anything.

38:40.405 --> 38:42.494
Hopefully.

38:42.537 --> 38:46.628
I took your advice,
I did not talk to Lorraine.

38:46.672 --> 38:48.413
Oh.

38:48.456 --> 38:52.765
See, it appeared to me
the only thing to do was,

38:52.808 --> 38:56.377
essentially, to do nothing,

38:56.421 --> 38:59.075
and hope nobody was the wiser.

39:01.774 --> 39:05.343
I can't pretend we have
an equal say in here.

39:05.386 --> 39:09.259
I do have the last word.

39:09.303 --> 39:11.784
I sometimes question
your advice,

39:11.827 --> 39:15.396
but I never dismiss it.

39:15.440 --> 39:17.833
Please try and remember that.

39:17.877 --> 39:19.966
Will do.
Yes, sir.

39:20.009 --> 39:21.402
Copy that.

39:21.446 --> 39:25.885
And three against one
is never fair.

39:25.928 --> 39:27.756
So from now on,

39:27.800 --> 39:32.195
one of you suck it up
and side with me.

Hold on, hold on. Hold on.[everyone quiets]

we try that again?

What do you think, Pop?

40:04.750 --> 40:06.752
Absolutely.

40:06.795 --> 40:08.797
Did I mess up?
Did I forget something?

40:08.841 --> 40:09.885
No.

No, nobody messed up,

40:11.365 --> 40:12.453
nobody forgot anything.

What's going on?

40:13.889 --> 40:15.413
It was rushed.

40:15.456 --> 40:17.110
Isn't it always?

40:17.153 --> 40:21.723
Well, yeah, see,
today is different.

40:24.813 --> 40:26.728
Oh, I get it.

40:26.772 --> 40:27.729
Get what?

40:27.773 --> 40:30.863
Uh, I get it, too.
You get it?

40:30.906 --> 40:33.343
It's that time,
isn't it?

40:34.344 --> 40:36.085
What time?
I don't get it.

40:36.129 --> 40:39.480
16 years at this table
and you still don't get it?

40:41.090 --> 40:43.832
[gasps] Oh! I got it.

40:43.876 --> 40:45.355
I got it.Thank you, numbnuts.

40:45.399 --> 40:47.488
I still don't got it.
