00:01.355 --> 00:03.516
<i>So Dennis hasn't
even seen the apartment yet?</i>

00:03.548 --> 00:06.955
<i>No. No. Yeah, Dennis lost a bet,
and I got to redesign</i>

00:06.988 --> 00:09.227
our old apartment. He is gonna flip!

00:09.258 --> 00:10.685
- Ooh. Nice. - Ah.
- That's great. I'm just

00:10.718 --> 00:12.276
excited to have my old
place back to myself.

00:12.307 --> 00:14.092
And guys, after the grand opening,

00:14.124 --> 00:16.329
we finally get a chance to fire...

00:17.152 --> 00:18.601
...the rocket launcher.

00:18.633 --> 00:20.450
- Ooh. - Yes!
- Nice, dude! You got a rocket!

00:20.482 --> 00:21.910
It finally came in the mail,
and now we have

00:21.942 --> 00:23.912
- the perfect opportunity to celebrate with it.
- Oh.

00:23.947 --> 00:25.169
- Yeah, that will be good.
- Fire in the hole.

00:25.204 --> 00:27.035
Guys, guys, guys, listen, listen.
There's a girl.

00:27.068 --> 00:28.982
She's coming, okay?
There's a girl... Mandy.

00:29.014 --> 00:30.960
Okay, she's here to stay, all right?

00:30.992 --> 00:33.069
And-and-and you guys have
to take my lead because

00:33.100 --> 00:34.528
I'm-I'm another guy, so don't address me

00:34.561 --> 00:36.767
- as me because I'm somebody else.
- Are we us?

00:36.799 --> 00:38.062
Well, yeah, of course you are.

00:38.063 --> 00:40.271
I don't want to be me.
Can I be someone else?

00:40.271 --> 00:42.352
No. You have to be you, okay?
All of you are yourselves,

00:42.352 --> 00:44.552
- except for Dee.
- Okay, wait, wait, wait, wait.

00:44.585 --> 00:46.986
- Are you right-handed, or left-handed?
- That won't come up.

00:47.018 --> 00:48.426
- Well, it could come up.
- It won't!

00:48.426 --> 00:49.627
Okay. I'm gonna go with left then.

00:49.628 --> 00:50.528
- I'll go with left.
- Cool. Left.

00:50.586 --> 00:51.980
Let's go with the hand that I am,
for Christ's sakes.

00:51.980 --> 00:54.609
Hey! Mandy. Hi.

00:54.642 --> 00:56.425
Hey. Ooh.

00:56.457 --> 00:58.566
Why'd you run up
ahead of me there, Brian?

00:58.599 --> 01:00.286
Oh, I had to use the bathroom super bad.

01:00.318 --> 01:01.746
Oh.

01:01.778 --> 01:03.692
So, this is the hangout spot then, huh?

01:03.724 --> 01:05.703
Yeah, yeah, yeah, these are my friends.

01:05.735 --> 01:06.839
Oh, so that

01:06.870 --> 01:08.557
- must make you Prudence then.
- Yes.

01:08.589 --> 01:11.218
- Uh-huh. Yes, it does.
- Yeah.

01:11.251 --> 01:12.272
- Oh.
- He is Prudence,

01:12.273 --> 01:13.473
- and I'm Griffin.
- No, he's Mac!

01:13.520 --> 01:16.181
He's just Mac, so don't... Yeah.

01:16.213 --> 01:17.478
And that's Charlie, and that's Frank.

01:17.510 --> 01:18.938
And he's left-handed.

01:18.970 --> 01:20.625
- Yeah.
- Oh.

01:20.657 --> 01:22.965
I suppose I didn't know that about you.

01:23.000 --> 01:24.162
Yeah. No, well, there was

01:24.163 --> 01:25.563
- really no reason for it to come up.
- Mama.

01:25.652 --> 01:27.243
Uh, guys, this is, uh,

01:27.275 --> 01:28.634
- Mandy.
- Hi.

01:28.634 --> 01:30.455
And this is, uh...
this is little Brian Junior.

01:30.486 --> 01:31.784
Oh.

01:31.817 --> 01:33.674
Yeah. He's my son.

01:57.802 --> 01:59.266
Well, I'm gonna go with left-handed.

01:59.266 --> 02:01.970
- Left-handed or right-handed, man?
- What's going on here, dude?

02:01.970 --> 02:04.141
All right, look, you guys remember
when we did that Boggs thing.

02:04.141 --> 02:05.924
We flew out to California?
Well, if you recall,

02:05.924 --> 02:07.983
I actually got off in North Dakota.

02:08.015 --> 02:09.806
Right? Being out of town,
I thought, naturally,

02:09.839 --> 02:11.563
I'm gonna have a little bit of fun,
you know, so,

02:11.595 --> 02:13.514
I picked up Mandy
there at an Applebee's.

02:13.546 --> 02:15.303
- Oh.
- I was pretending to be

02:15.335 --> 02:17.742
an airline pilot who flies out
of Philly named Brian LeFevre.

02:17.776 --> 02:19.044
I went to an old character.

02:19.077 --> 02:20.834
I needed a complete back
story for the manipulation.

02:20.865 --> 02:23.761
- Of course, of course.
- Yeah, but wasn't Prudence Brian's wife?

02:23.794 --> 02:25.616
Yes, but in this scenario,
she's my sister.

02:25.647 --> 02:27.794
See, I'm always tweaking
things based on the situation.

02:27.829 --> 02:29.616
And needless to say,
it worked like a charm.

02:29.649 --> 02:31.405
But, uh, five months later,

02:31.437 --> 02:33.520
she calls me up,
tells me she's pregnant.

02:33.552 --> 02:34.539
- Oh!
- Mm.

02:34.540 --> 02:36.773
Christ, what am I gonna do here?
And need I remind you,

02:36.805 --> 02:38.888
once she finds out that
I'm not who I said I was,

02:38.920 --> 02:40.196
and that I don't have any money,

02:40.196 --> 02:41.979
- she could come after the bar.
- Ah.

02:42.012 --> 02:43.443
- She could be entitled to that?
- Ah... shit. - All right, guys,

02:43.474 --> 02:45.068
guys, everybody
just calm down, all right?

02:45.100 --> 02:47.508
Maybe it's not about money for her.
Look, as we all know,

02:47.541 --> 02:49.479
everything is about emotion with women.

02:49.514 --> 02:50.468
- Right, Dee?
- What?!

02:50.501 --> 02:52.255
- Whoa. - Whoa.
- Oh, my God. Whoa!

02:52.290 --> 02:53.364
- All right, Dee, relax.
- Oh, whoa.

02:53.397 --> 02:54.342
- Rrr.
- We're trying to have

02:54.342 --> 02:55.807
a rational conversation, okay?

02:55.807 --> 02:57.755
- Yeah, we're trying to help our friend here.
- Look, I think the point is,

02:57.788 --> 02:59.545
maybe we got to close the emotion door

02:59.578 --> 03:02.311
for Mandy by telling
her that you're gay.

03:02.342 --> 03:04.295
Yeah, right,
but I already had sex with her.

03:04.326 --> 03:05.628
How am I gonna convince her I'm gay?

03:05.660 --> 03:06.503
Just go with me here.

03:06.503 --> 03:09.304
Brian's not above having a
one-night stand with a woman,

03:09.337 --> 03:11.289
but he's got no room for her emotionally

03:11.321 --> 03:14.185
- because he's in love with me.
- With you?

03:14.217 --> 03:16.526
- Well, yes, the lover is me, of course.
- Mm.

03:16.558 --> 03:17.599
- Next plan.
- That plan

03:17.631 --> 03:20.800
stinks, because it's always
about money with women.

03:20.835 --> 03:21.731
That's all there is to it.

03:22.041 --> 03:23.358
So I think the best thing to do is

03:23.389 --> 03:25.243
to find a guy who's got
more money than you,

03:25.275 --> 03:27.586
like in that movie,
uh, <i>Indecent Proposal.</i>

03:27.618 --> 03:30.318
You get a millionaire to
bang her for a million bucks.

03:30.813 --> 03:32.303
She takes the money and runs.

03:32.336 --> 03:34.515
Would you sleep with her
for a million dollars?

03:35.236 --> 03:36.583
No way. It's too much money.

03:36.618 --> 03:37.767
All right, next plan. Dee.

03:37.800 --> 03:38.946
Yeah, no, I've got a great plan,

03:38.946 --> 03:41.737
but, uh, I'm thinking that this
isn't my problem, and, also,

03:41.769 --> 03:43.298
you guys wouldn't listen to
me no matter what I said.

03:43.330 --> 03:44.307
Good point. Charlie, plan.

03:44.338 --> 03:45.589
I got it. If I just get

03:45.589 --> 03:47.756
the waitress pregnant,
she's gonna be tied to me for life,

03:47.787 --> 03:49.154
so, I got to do that.

03:49.187 --> 03:50.030
He's already on to another thing.

03:50.030 --> 03:51.760
All right, Christ, uh,
I got to do something here.

03:51.760 --> 03:54.489
- Fine. Mac, we'll go with your plan.
- Yeah!

03:54.489 --> 03:55.474
- Yes! Yes.
- Mm.

03:55.474 --> 03:57.861
- Is the apartment ready?
- Yes. You are not

03:57.861 --> 03:59.663
gonna believe what I did to it.

04:02.249 --> 04:03.825
Surprise!

04:05.368 --> 04:06.909
Huh. It looks, uh...

04:06.910 --> 04:07.947
Exactly the same.

04:07.947 --> 04:10.949
I was able to track down
versions of our old furniture,

04:10.982 --> 04:12.282
and even found replicas

04:12.315 --> 04:14.040
of all the knickknacks
that burned in the fire.

04:14.071 --> 04:16.642
- It's bizarre.
- Bizarre in a good way.

04:16.673 --> 04:18.952
- No.
- You don't like it?

04:18.985 --> 04:20.579
No.

04:20.611 --> 04:23.018
Hey, so, I don't mean
to interrupt here, fellas,

04:23.049 --> 04:24.482
but I'm a little bit confused.

04:24.514 --> 04:26.433
You never told me you had a roommate.

04:26.937 --> 04:27.866
It's time, Brian.

04:27.898 --> 04:29.720
Here's where things get
a little bit tricky.

04:29.752 --> 04:32.744
Um... there's really
no easy way to say this,

04:32.777 --> 04:35.673
but, um, Mac and I aren't just friends.

04:35.704 --> 04:37.298
- He's actually my, uh...
- Lover.

04:37.331 --> 04:39.089
- Partner.
- Yes, well, we do make love.

04:39.121 --> 04:41.366
- We don't actually make love...
- He's the power bottom.

04:41.397 --> 04:43.642
- Now he generates a tremendous amount of power...
- Yeah. No, I...

04:43.675 --> 04:45.627
- ...from the bottom.
- I don't. I don't, actually.

04:45.658 --> 04:46.875
- Don't sell yourself short. He does.
- No, no. It's not that I...

04:46.875 --> 04:48.645
It's just that we don't have sex.

04:48.645 --> 04:50.832
Yeah, I, uh... I sleep with women,

04:50.863 --> 04:53.401
but I'm emotionally involved with Mac,

04:53.434 --> 04:54.866
which is why...

04:54.897 --> 04:56.687
and this is the hard part... I...

04:56.720 --> 04:59.258
I don't really...
I don't have room emotionally

04:59.289 --> 05:01.371
in my life for you.

05:02.164 --> 05:05.276
Okay. Uh... Wow.

05:05.307 --> 05:06.933
Well, I'm a little bit shocked here.

05:06.965 --> 05:07.749
Sure.

05:07.750 --> 05:10.057
- Mm.
- But I guess the most important thing is

05:10.090 --> 05:12.790
for Brian, Jr. to have
a relationship with his father.

05:12.822 --> 05:16.011
And you know, Mac,
you seem like a real stand-up fella,

05:16.042 --> 05:18.449
so, if you boys are open to it,

05:18.482 --> 05:20.077
the only thing I can think of better

05:20.109 --> 05:23.524
than Junior having one dad is,
well, him having two.

05:23.556 --> 05:25.281
Ee.

05:25.314 --> 05:26.746
- Yeah. No.
- Wow. I wasn't expecting that.

05:26.778 --> 05:28.861
We're the type of guys that, um...

05:28.893 --> 05:31.332
Who would love this.

05:31.363 --> 05:32.306
Oh!

05:37.719 --> 05:38.929
Yeah. Coming.

05:40.341 --> 05:41.548
Hey, come on in.

05:41.579 --> 05:43.085
All right, Charlie, you got 15 minutes,

05:43.085 --> 05:46.134
and it's a dollar a minute
starting... now.

05:46.165 --> 05:47.890
Oh, no.

05:47.923 --> 05:50.168
No, no, no, no.
No, we're not doing this. Uh-uh.

05:50.200 --> 05:52.152
Uh, now hear me out. It's not about sex.

05:52.183 --> 05:54.916
- Okay, good.
- It's about having a baby.

05:54.949 --> 05:57.007
- And I'm gone.
- Uh, no, no, no, hang on.

05:57.007 --> 05:58.505
Hang on, one...
Just one second. Come on.

05:58.505 --> 06:00.786
Look, I know you've always
wanted a baby, right?

06:00.786 --> 06:02.691
I see you.
You poke around the preschools

06:02.724 --> 06:05.522
and the playgrounds, and you got
that longing look in your eye.

06:05.553 --> 06:06.443
Oh, God, that's so creepy.

06:06.443 --> 06:07.986
Well, look, I can tell you this.

06:07.986 --> 06:10.173
It...

06:10.206 --> 06:11.963
It's not gonna happen for you.

06:11.994 --> 06:13.058
Excuse me?

06:13.059 --> 06:15.059
Yeah, you ain't gonna have
a baby. Check this out.

06:15.151 --> 06:18.209
Your life has been on a slow,
but steady decline for years.

06:18.241 --> 06:19.889
You were a coffee shop waitress, right?

06:19.889 --> 06:21.884
On-again, off-again
troubles with alcohol.

06:21.917 --> 06:23.707
Living in a women's shelter.

06:23.738 --> 06:27.643
And finally,
all women's Achilles' heel... time.

06:29.400 --> 06:30.700
Okay. Are you done?

06:30.733 --> 06:32.945
- Because I feel like there's more.
- No.

06:32.977 --> 06:34.548
- I'm seeing, like, a whole...
- Yeah, this is... I'm getting to the good part.

06:34.548 --> 06:36.620
Look. Frank will provide for us.

06:36.620 --> 06:38.020
- Right? He's got tons of money.
- Mm-hmm.

06:38.052 --> 06:41.728
You're never gonna have to work
another day in your life. See? Zzz.

06:41.760 --> 06:43.713
All the way to sitting on
the beach in Rio de Janeiro.

06:43.745 --> 06:45.144
Driving the lane to fame.

06:45.175 --> 06:47.095
Okay, so...

06:47.127 --> 06:51.357
the point is this,
life with Charlie and a baby...

06:52.332 --> 06:54.055
...looking pretty good.

06:54.891 --> 06:56.530
Did you really think
that this was gonna work?

06:56.562 --> 06:57.589
- Did you really think that...
- Well...

06:57.589 --> 06:59.620
...you would just have me in
here and you could just...

06:59.653 --> 07:01.115
hurl insults at me.

07:01.148 --> 07:03.035
- Huh?
- I've tried everything for years with you.

07:03.068 --> 07:04.337
And I just... at this point,

07:04.369 --> 07:05.345
I just don't know what else to say.

07:05.377 --> 07:06.948
Oh, my God!
Stop saying things to me.

07:06.948 --> 07:07.932
Don't you understand that

07:07.932 --> 07:09.573
this is never gonna happen,
so let it go.

07:09.573 --> 07:12.192
Look, w-why? You won't ever tell me why.

07:12.192 --> 07:13.713
You just say no,
and you won't give me a shot.

07:13.713 --> 07:15.500
I don't understand what's
so terrible about me.

07:15.500 --> 07:16.998
What's so great about me, Charlie?

07:16.998 --> 07:17.912
What's wrong with you?

07:17.912 --> 07:19.305
Why are you so obsessed with me?

07:19.305 --> 07:21.043
I mean, you said it yourself,
I'm a mess.

07:21.184 --> 07:24.179
So, why don't you just
go find somebody better?

07:24.212 --> 07:25.214
Well...

07:25.641 --> 07:27.196
'cause there is no one better.

07:28.432 --> 07:30.036
And...

07:30.068 --> 07:31.238
I love you.

07:38.113 --> 07:38.928
Yes.

07:38.961 --> 07:40.719
Those jerks are finally gone.

07:40.751 --> 07:41.857
Time to stretch out around here.

07:42.672 --> 07:43.316
Heyo.

07:44.360 --> 07:45.438
What's the haps, Dee?

07:45.470 --> 07:46.577
What are you doing, Frank?

07:46.608 --> 07:48.530
Oh, Charlie's doing a thing
at the apartment tonight,

07:48.561 --> 07:49.668
so I'm gonna crash here.

07:49.701 --> 07:50.711
- Okay?
- No, get a hotel.

07:50.742 --> 07:52.435
You know what,
do you mind if I take the bed?

07:52.468 --> 07:54.551
Because I got a little
pinched nerve in my neck.

07:54.586 --> 07:56.323
- It's driving me crazy.
- Wh... yeah, I mind.

07:56.358 --> 07:57.420
I'm gonna go take a steam bath,

07:57.455 --> 07:59.499
so why don't you whip me
up a bowl of that popcorn.

07:59.534 --> 08:00.576
That smells so good.

08:00.611 --> 08:01.767
- No. I'm not gonna do that.
- Thanks.

08:01.802 --> 08:03.343
No, no, no, no, no, no. Frank! Stop!

08:03.378 --> 08:05.545
Don't get all emotional, just do it.

08:05.580 --> 08:07.146
I don't want this.

08:12.389 --> 08:13.332
Okay.

08:13.364 --> 08:14.454
They're asleep.

08:14.454 --> 08:17.888
Dude, why did you say you
wanted to raise the kid?

08:17.922 --> 08:19.192
I just got caught up in the moment,
you know?

08:19.223 --> 08:20.330
It was so exciting.

08:20.362 --> 08:21.469
Maybe we should do it.

08:21.501 --> 08:23.748
W-we? We are not a couple, Mac.

08:23.780 --> 08:25.244
Well, no, we would just keep pretending.

08:25.276 --> 08:27.198
I am not gonna pretend
to be in a relationship

08:27.230 --> 08:28.956
with you for the entirety
of my child's life.

08:28.987 --> 08:30.647
Are you insane?

08:30.679 --> 08:32.437
Lo... okay, you know what?
I can't handle this right now.

08:32.470 --> 08:33.576
I'm gonna go sleep in your room.

08:33.610 --> 08:34.717
You can sleep on the couch.

08:34.749 --> 08:36.019
Oh, no... w-w-wait, Dennis.

08:36.051 --> 08:37.255
Dennis, Dennis, Dennis.

08:37.285 --> 08:39.078
Uh, hold on one second... I-I...

08:43.633 --> 08:44.577
What is this?

08:45.056 --> 08:46.694
This is the gym.

08:46.726 --> 08:47.777
Uh-huh.

08:48.813 --> 08:50.631
And where were you going to sleep?

08:50.664 --> 08:54.571
Well, I figured since we got so used
to sleeping in the same bed at Dee's,

08:54.602 --> 08:55.708
that we could just sort of

08:55.740 --> 08:57.662
- continue that here.
- Mm-hmm.

08:57.694 --> 08:58.801
You want to sleep on the couch...

08:58.833 --> 08:59.908
...together.

09:01.394 --> 09:03.943
I'm gonna sleep next to the dildo bike.

09:03.975 --> 09:07.263
The Ass-pounder, uh, 4000,
is an exercise... bike.

09:12.112 --> 09:14.748
That was, um...

09:14.781 --> 09:17.678
That was not as bad as I expected.

09:17.711 --> 09:18.752
It was amazing.

09:18.785 --> 09:19.891
It kind of was.

09:19.924 --> 09:21.030
It kind of was amazing.

09:21.063 --> 09:22.072
- Oh, yeah.
- Yeah.

09:22.104 --> 09:24.480
Oh. Hmm.

09:24.512 --> 09:26.302
What is this? What are you doing there?

09:26.335 --> 09:27.442
- This? Oh, this just
- Yeah.

09:27.474 --> 09:29.524
improves the chances of conception.

09:29.557 --> 09:31.934
Of what?

09:31.966 --> 09:33.236
Of getting pregnant.

09:33.267 --> 09:34.701
Oh. Right.

09:34.733 --> 09:35.839
Uh, the baby.

09:35.871 --> 09:38.118
Right.

09:38.149 --> 09:40.720
Hey, you know, speaking of which, um,

09:40.754 --> 09:44.171
I think we're gonna need
to make some changes around here.

09:44.203 --> 09:45.868
Oh. Like what?

09:46.633 --> 09:51.169
Um, well, I think you need to repaint,
for starters.

09:51.861 --> 09:53.284
Wh-why would I do that?

09:53.317 --> 09:56.343
Charlie, this...
this paint could be full of lead.

09:57.243 --> 09:58.297
Are you serious?

09:58.328 --> 10:00.087
I can't carry a baby around lead paint.

10:00.119 --> 10:01.877
Or... or, oh, I'm sorry.

10:01.910 --> 10:03.592
Did you expect me to live
in the women's shelter

10:03.592 --> 10:04.986
while I'm carrying your child?

10:04.986 --> 10:06.922
Oh, no, um...

10:06.955 --> 10:08.224
I hadn't thought about it,
but you can stay here.

10:08.255 --> 10:09.362
- I mean, that's fine.
- Okay.

10:09.394 --> 10:10.516
Oh, wow. Oh, thank you so much.

10:10.516 --> 10:12.128
When this baby comes out, though,

10:12.162 --> 10:13.822
Frank's gonna need to find
us a nicer place to live.

10:14.170 --> 10:15.472
Oh, but I love this place.

10:15.504 --> 10:16.740
Okay, well, I don't, and it's no place

10:16.774 --> 10:18.044
to raise a child,
so end of conversation.

10:18.076 --> 10:19.019
Whoa.

10:19.052 --> 10:20.322
Hey. Hang on.

10:20.354 --> 10:21.786
You're kind of coming
on strong right now.

10:21.819 --> 10:23.089
- Are you serious right now?
- Well, look...

10:23.120 --> 10:24.715
I'm carrying your child.

10:24.747 --> 10:25.854
- N-n-n-n-n-n-no.
- Carrying my...

10:25.886 --> 10:27.481
I am not finished talking.

10:27.513 --> 10:28.947
Who's idea was this in the first place?

10:28.979 --> 10:30.737
Look, I'm just saying
if you want to be a mom,

10:30.768 --> 10:32.200
you're gonna have to learn
how to control your emotions.

10:32.233 --> 10:34.512
I need to control my emotions?

10:34.543 --> 10:36.432
Or I'm not gonna be a good mother?

10:36.465 --> 10:38.418
Oh, my God!

10:50.019 --> 10:50.753
Dee!

10:50.785 --> 10:53.045
- I'm in trouble here.
- What? What are you doing here?

10:53.045 --> 10:55.147
The waitress is totally, like,
moving into my apartment.

10:55.179 --> 10:56.360
I-I-I can't take it.

10:56.360 --> 10:57.913
I'm gonna need to hide
out here for a few days.

10:57.945 --> 10:59.410
No. No. Hard no. Get out.

10:59.443 --> 11:00.517
It's like, I didn't think
about the whole, like,

11:00.549 --> 11:01.851
having a baby thing, you know?

11:01.883 --> 11:03.284
It's like one thing to
trap a person with a baby,

11:03.316 --> 11:04.260
but then when you actually have a baby,

11:04.293 --> 11:05.399
then you become trapped.

11:05.431 --> 11:06.733
What baby thing?
What are you talking about?

11:06.765 --> 11:08.719
And plus, it's totally turning her
into, like, a different person.

11:08.752 --> 11:10.281
She's, like,
acting like a real bitch now.

11:10.313 --> 11:11.649
- She's always been a bitch.
- Now who's being a bitch, Dee?

11:11.680 --> 11:12.884
Come on, I need help here, all right?

11:12.917 --> 11:14.024
Look, I-I got to sleep, okay?

11:14.057 --> 11:15.228
I can't think straight.

11:15.261 --> 11:17.442
- I... ah, Christ... is he snoring?
- Yeah.

11:17.474 --> 11:19.395
Snoring's the worst.
I'm gonna need to crash

11:19.426 --> 11:21.347
- next to you, all right? You know what?
- What?

11:21.379 --> 11:24.276
Don't be a whore tonight, Dee,
and try and bang me again, okay?

11:24.308 --> 11:26.132
Because I got nothing left.

11:26.164 --> 11:27.924
I'm spent; I'm really exhausted.

11:28.336 --> 11:30.461
Too much sex and too much... stuff.

11:30.493 --> 11:32.032
Just don't be a whore, okay?

11:38.506 --> 11:39.652
- Dee! Egg!
- Where is it?

11:39.653 --> 11:40.953
Where is it? There's no eggs here.

11:41.040 --> 11:42.962
- Where are your eggs?
- Dee, where are your eggs?

11:42.997 --> 11:43.716
Dee, eggs!

11:43.716 --> 11:44.798
- Dee, we're looking for your eggs.
- Where are your eggs?

11:44.799 --> 11:46.489
- We can't find them!
- Come on, leave me alone.

11:46.493 --> 11:48.391
Just let me sleep;
I barely slept last night.

11:48.466 --> 11:49.571
Dee. Deandra.

11:49.603 --> 11:50.643
Look, don't be so emotional.

11:50.675 --> 11:51.618
You're being very emotional.

11:51.650 --> 11:52.918
Get up and get us an egg.

11:52.951 --> 11:54.250
I'm getting like calls up
the wazoo from the waitress.

11:54.250 --> 11:55.796
She's asking for, like,
groceries and shit.

11:55.796 --> 11:57.484
- I mean, who does that?
- No.

11:57.484 --> 11:58.767
Who-who just barges
into someone's apartment

11:58.799 --> 11:59.807
- and takes over?
- Nobody.

11:59.840 --> 12:00.787
Oh, my God, are you serious?

12:00.787 --> 12:02.505
That's exactly what you guys are doing!

12:02.536 --> 12:04.486
Uh, Dee, eggs, okay? I'm freaking out.

12:04.519 --> 12:05.755
What is happening here?

12:05.786 --> 12:07.119
I just got rid of two
annoying roommates.

12:07.151 --> 12:08.517
This is not supposed to be happening.

12:08.548 --> 12:09.978
God! She's calling me again!

12:10.011 --> 12:11.279
It's like she's totally stalking me.

12:11.310 --> 12:12.370
Dee, what do I do here?

12:12.805 --> 12:14.560
You have been stalking
that woman for 15 years.

12:14.592 --> 12:15.861
Now she's finally showing
you some attention,

12:15.893 --> 12:16.965
and you don't like it?

12:16.997 --> 12:18.265
Oh, Dee, you know what? Eggs.

12:18.297 --> 12:19.271
I didn't ask for your opinion.

12:19.303 --> 12:20.214
Yes, you did!

12:20.247 --> 12:22.002
Hey, oh, good, Dee.

12:22.034 --> 12:23.821
I need you to watch Brian Jr.
for a few hours.

12:23.852 --> 12:25.446
- N-n-n-n-n-no.
- Y-y-y-y-yeah.

12:25.478 --> 12:26.583
Frank, what the hell
are you doing here, man?

12:26.615 --> 12:27.688
You're supposed to be
finding my millionaire.

12:27.720 --> 12:30.158
I'm on it. I'm here trying
to get her to make us breakfast.

12:30.191 --> 12:31.620
- Yeah, we haven't got any eggs.
- I need an egg.

12:31.652 --> 12:34.058
Dee, why have you not
made this man his egg?

12:34.089 --> 12:35.194
Do you want to take care
of this child for the rest

12:35.226 --> 12:36.624
of your life, is that what you want?

12:36.657 --> 12:37.762
Or do you want me to get out
of this situation that I'm in?

12:37.795 --> 12:39.127
I'm gonna smash it!

12:39.159 --> 12:40.874
Oh, Dee, don't get emotional.

12:40.909 --> 12:43.286
Christ, if you're upset,
smash an egg into a pan for Frank.

12:43.317 --> 12:45.106
Solve problems, don't cause them.

12:50.305 --> 12:53.846
Oh, gee whiz,
look how fancy this place is.

12:53.879 --> 12:56.285
We don't have anything like
this back in North Dakota.

12:56.317 --> 12:57.584
Oh, yeah? Fascinating.

12:57.616 --> 13:00.670
Um, so, Mandy, um,
we have brought you here,

13:00.702 --> 13:02.165
uh, to meet a gentleman.

13:02.198 --> 13:03.790
- Um, I just feel really
- Oh.

13:03.823 --> 13:06.196
badly now being able to
provide emotionally for you,

13:06.227 --> 13:07.851
so I thought we could
set you up with somebody

13:07.884 --> 13:09.315
who can provide for you both emotionally

13:09.347 --> 13:10.744
and financially.

13:10.777 --> 13:13.539
Um, so we are here
to meet a millionaire.

13:13.571 --> 13:15.457
Oh, geez.

13:15.488 --> 13:16.658
I don't know.

13:16.690 --> 13:17.894
Yeah. No, I know.

13:17.926 --> 13:19.193
It's, a, it's a little str... Oh, oh...

13:19.224 --> 13:20.656
- Hey.
- Let's do this.

13:20.688 --> 13:21.477
Oh.

13:21.520 --> 13:24.393
Uh, Frank, where's the, uh, millionaire?

13:24.425 --> 13:26.343
I am the millionaire, I'm the guy.

13:26.374 --> 13:27.642
- What?
- Mandy,

13:27.675 --> 13:29.267
here's what we're gonna do.

13:29.299 --> 13:30.892
I'm gonna make you a decent proposal.

13:30.924 --> 13:33.167
Not an indecent proposal
like in the movie...

13:33.199 --> 13:35.928
because I think to pay a
million bucks to get laid...

13:35.961 --> 13:37.553
that's out of the question.

13:37.585 --> 13:40.185
I'm gonna offer you $5,000.

13:40.217 --> 13:41.452
- What are you doing, Frank?
- Look,

13:41.484 --> 13:43.402
I'm gonna give you $5,000, we bang,

13:43.434 --> 13:45.872
you take the money, you go up,
you get on a plane,

13:45.903 --> 13:48.276
you fly to wherever the
hell it is in the sticks,

13:48.308 --> 13:51.201
and, uh, you know,
$5,000 goes a long way up there.

13:51.232 --> 13:53.312
If you need more money, call me up,

13:53.345 --> 13:55.003
come back, we bang again.

13:55.034 --> 13:56.790
Price goes down
'cause I already had you.

13:56.822 --> 13:58.414
But if you want to bring a girlfriend...

13:59.246 --> 14:00.559
price goes back up.

14:02.997 --> 14:06.019
- Well, I don't know what to say here.
- I do.

14:06.051 --> 14:08.747
Five grand is a lot of money...
is that offer just out on the table?

14:08.779 --> 14:11.022
- I'm not gonna bang you.
- I don't want to bang you, either, Frank,

14:11.054 --> 14:13.167
- but I'll power through for five grand.
- Well, no, you wouldn't want to,

14:13.199 --> 14:14.596
because you're emotionally
involved with me.

14:14.629 --> 14:16.417
Aw. Shit. Sorry, Dennis.

14:16.449 --> 14:17.359
- Hey. Dennis?
- Brian,

14:17.392 --> 14:18.562
I meant. I'm sorry.

14:18.593 --> 14:19.796
- Yeah, sometimes...
- Brian is his name.

14:19.829 --> 14:21.649
Dennis is his sex slave name.

14:21.681 --> 14:23.274
- He's my gimp.
- What? No. I...

14:23.305 --> 14:24.345
- I don't have a sex slave name.
- Wait.

14:24.378 --> 14:25.386
- I'm not...
- Wait, hold on,

14:25.418 --> 14:27.173
what's going on here, Brian?

14:27.204 --> 14:28.472
Look,

14:28.504 --> 14:30.358
I'm gonna go to the can
and make my morning move.

14:30.389 --> 14:32.794
You want the cash, you come on in,
earn it the hard way.

14:32.827 --> 14:34.582
Okay? If the broad comes,

14:34.615 --> 14:37.377
order me an egg.

14:40.300 --> 14:42.706
Well, that was a disaster.
Frank almost ruined everything.

14:42.739 --> 14:44.883
Okay, do you want me to go down
to the car and talk to her?

14:44.915 --> 14:47.905
And spin more perverted tales about me?
Why am I a gimp?

14:47.936 --> 14:49.839
Oh, God, just get your kid
and get out of here, Dennis.

14:49.840 --> 14:50.640
Yeah, I'll get the kid,

14:50.698 --> 14:52.476
but I got to come back because
I need to crash here tonight.

14:52.476 --> 14:54.401
I'm not sleeping next
to Mac's dildo bike again.

14:54.402 --> 14:55.132
What?

14:55.132 --> 14:58.335
No, me too. Your bed is working
wonders for my pinched nerve.

14:58.368 --> 15:00.254
Yeah, you know what? I'm gonna
crash here for a little bit too.

15:00.286 --> 15:02.143
I feel like I got to ghost the
waitress for a while on this.

15:02.143 --> 15:04.478
I'm gonna stay as well because
I need to sleep next to Dennis.

15:04.510 --> 15:05.810
All right, then
we're gonna need a lot of eggs.

15:05.841 --> 15:07.889
- Dee, how about a carton of eggs?
- Ooh!

15:11.042 --> 15:13.414
No, goddamnit, I didn't want
to be wrapped up in this!

15:13.445 --> 15:14.908
I didn't want to be wrapped
up in the kid thing,

15:14.941 --> 15:16.176
that's your mistake.

15:16.207 --> 15:17.508
Listen to me,

15:17.540 --> 15:19.133
I can figure this out,
I've got a new plan

15:19.166 --> 15:20.815
and you're all gonna
goddamn listen up, okay?

15:22.109 --> 15:25.437
It's time for Brian LeFevre to die.

15:25.469 --> 15:28.068
- Over here. Over here.
- Hmm?

15:28.100 --> 15:30.148
- Go, go, go, go, go, go.
- What... where... what is-what is going on here?

15:30.181 --> 15:31.774
I thought-I thought we were
gonna go see the Liberty Bell.

15:31.806 --> 15:33.074
There's no time for that,
there's no time.

15:33.105 --> 15:35.428
What... what is going on here, Brian?

15:35.463 --> 15:37.797
All right, listen to me,
because we only have a few minutes

15:37.797 --> 15:40.000
before they realize
they can't hear or see us back here.

15:40.001 --> 15:41.301
What? Who?

15:41.716 --> 15:44.036
My name... my name isn't Brian LeFevre.

15:44.576 --> 15:46.017
My real name...

15:46.017 --> 15:48.183
is Dane Brass.

15:48.215 --> 15:50.458
And I hold top secret
government information.

15:50.490 --> 15:52.602
Okay? They're after me, that's-that's
why everything's been so weird.

15:52.634 --> 15:54.357
That's why I haven't been
able to speak openly with you.

15:54.389 --> 15:56.086
And you and Brian Jr.,
you'll have to get away from me

15:56.086 --> 15:57.357
because it's-it's not safe.

15:57.466 --> 16:00.196
What do you mean it's not safe?
I don't... Oh, my God.

16:00.228 --> 16:02.017
- You're bleeding!
- Oh...

16:02.049 --> 16:04.128
Oh, oh. I've been shot.

16:04.590 --> 16:05.558
Well, I didn't hear any gun...

16:05.881 --> 16:07.182
Oh, well...

16:07.214 --> 16:09.124
yeah, not there it is there.
That was the sound of it.

16:09.159 --> 16:11.430
Normally you'd... you'd hear it
before you see the blood,

16:11.465 --> 16:13.104
but, uh, not in this case.

16:13.408 --> 16:14.218
Run!

16:14.253 --> 16:16.909
Oh, it's killing me. Run, Mandy, no.

16:16.944 --> 16:19.428
You... you have to run
and not ever look back.

16:19.463 --> 16:20.921
Or contact me ever again.

16:20.956 --> 16:23.241
And you'll never get any
money or assets from me

16:23.276 --> 16:24.742
because if you do,
it'll be unsafe for you.

16:24.857 --> 16:25.603
Run!

16:28.431 --> 16:29.505
Oh, my God!

16:29.537 --> 16:30.674
- They got Dennis.
- Dane.

16:30.706 --> 16:32.333
- Uh, Dane, of course, Dane.
- Dane.

16:32.364 --> 16:33.870
Yeah, he had so many identities,
it's hard to remember...

16:33.870 --> 16:35.239
We got to get him to a hospital!

16:35.239 --> 16:37.079
Not a regular hospital,
though, 'cause technically,

16:37.079 --> 16:38.494
- he's not supposed to exist.
- A bad guy one.

16:38.494 --> 16:39.968
Oh, no, I've lost my lover.

16:40.001 --> 16:41.204
I'll need a new gimp!

16:41.235 --> 16:42.189
I'm not his lover.

16:42.189 --> 16:44.452
Never had sex. Not a gimp.

16:44.485 --> 16:46.015
Oh, run, Mandy. Oh.

16:46.015 --> 16:49.880
Good-bye.
Uh... good-bye, Mandy, good-bye.

16:49.912 --> 16:54.105
Brian Jr.

16:54.136 --> 16:55.338
Aw.

16:55.371 --> 16:56.867
Well, there it is.

16:58.686 --> 17:00.929
Well...

17:00.961 --> 17:02.488
okay.

17:02.519 --> 17:04.436
Are you all finished?

17:05.240 --> 17:06.061
Come on.

17:06.093 --> 17:08.401
You can open your eyes now,
I know you're not dead.

17:08.434 --> 17:09.708
Ah, geez.

17:09.708 --> 17:13.406
You big city folks sure like
to complicate things, don't ya?

17:13.436 --> 17:16.785
Look, all I wanted was for Brian Jr.
to have a father,

17:16.817 --> 17:19.742
but we don't want to be with a man
who doesn't want to be with us.

17:19.773 --> 17:21.984
So, I guess we'll just...

17:22.016 --> 17:23.999
be getting back to North Dakota now.

17:24.031 --> 17:25.721
Okay, now,

17:25.752 --> 17:28.385
you want to come on up here
and say good-bye to Brian Jr.?

17:28.416 --> 17:30.628
Oh.

17:30.661 --> 17:31.799
Yeah.

17:31.830 --> 17:33.195
Okay.

17:33.228 --> 17:35.990
- Hey.
- Yeah.

17:36.021 --> 17:37.614
Hey, buddy.

17:37.647 --> 17:40.020
Um...

17:40.051 --> 17:41.969
good-bye and, um...

17:42.002 --> 17:43.139
you know, you be...

17:43.172 --> 17:44.732
you be good to your mom and, uh...

17:49.312 --> 17:52.237
- Okay, you all done?
- Yeah.

17:52.269 --> 17:54.026
All right.

17:57.274 --> 17:59.355
- Okay.
- Okay.

17:59.386 --> 18:01.308
Here we go.

18:03.211 --> 18:05.560
Bye, Dada.

18:08.160 --> 18:09.590
Bye.

18:10.105 --> 18:12.710
Well, all right.

18:12.741 --> 18:15.277
It was sure nice
getting to know you all.

18:15.664 --> 18:17.096
Whoever the heck you are.

18:33.257 --> 18:35.498
♪ What you gonna do when
you get out of jail? ♪

18:35.531 --> 18:37.806
♪ I'm gonna have some fun ♪

18:37.838 --> 18:40.048
♪ What do you consider fun? ♪

18:40.080 --> 18:43.005
♪ Fun, natural fun. ♪

18:45.583 --> 18:47.360
I can't do this.

18:47.391 --> 18:49.224
What are you talking about, bud?
The plan worked.

18:49.621 --> 18:51.584
No, this... no, this-this is crazy.

18:51.615 --> 18:53.370
What are we doing?
I can't... I-I can't...

18:53.402 --> 18:55.157
- I can't do any of this shit anymore.
- What?

18:55.841 --> 18:57.270
What's going on?

18:57.303 --> 18:58.895
Okay, I'm... I'm leaving.

18:58.926 --> 19:00.055
I'm gonna go be a dad.

19:00.055 --> 19:03.444
Well, hold on a-hold on a second,
you can't just leave.

19:03.477 --> 19:06.043
Yeah, you can't just go
become a dad, Dennis.

19:06.077 --> 19:07.702
That's not the way it works.

19:07.734 --> 19:09.457
You don't know the first thing about it.

19:09.489 --> 19:11.894
Well, you know what, Frank,
I'll figure it out, okay?

19:11.925 --> 19:14.720
Because I don't want my
kid to grow up like I did.

19:14.752 --> 19:17.093
With some asshole dad who
was never even around.

19:17.124 --> 19:18.879
You talking about me or Bruce?

19:18.911 --> 19:20.569
You!

19:20.602 --> 19:22.325
Okay, you know what? I... this is nuts.

19:22.356 --> 19:23.592
I got to... I just got to go.

19:23.623 --> 19:25.086
It's done. It's done, guys.

19:25.118 --> 19:26.255
Good-bye, Paddy's Pub.

19:27.447 --> 19:28.173
Good-bye, Philadelphia.

19:28.206 --> 19:30.091
Good-bye, Charlie.

19:30.122 --> 19:32.284
Mac, Dee, Frank.

19:34.510 --> 19:35.681
The bar's done.

19:38.149 --> 19:40.230
- Well, hang on a second.
- Actually,

19:40.261 --> 19:41.391
- it's not done.
- It's not done, no.

19:41.392 --> 19:42.392
We're still in here.

19:42.471 --> 19:44.219
Shh, just let me...

19:54.107 --> 19:56.412
Don't start talking, I can tell...

19:56.443 --> 19:58.200
- We weren't gonna say anything.
- The pause is too big.

19:58.231 --> 19:59.661
Well, this is, again,
this is why I'm leaving.

20:00.993 --> 20:02.294
Oh, good-bye.

20:02.325 --> 20:04.048
- Good-bye.
- Good-bye.

20:04.081 --> 20:05.884
- Hmm.
- Bye.

20:05.885 --> 20:06.885
Hmm.

20:07.038 --> 20:09.410
I can't believe he's actually gone.

20:09.441 --> 20:11.847
- Yeah.
- That's crazy.

20:11.880 --> 20:15.487
Well, now what?

20:22.440 --> 20:23.220
What a shot, man!

20:23.252 --> 20:24.682
Oh, my God!

20:24.714 --> 20:25.902
Whoa!
