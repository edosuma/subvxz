Come on, Hez! Spit it out, man!

00:32.366 --> 00:34.160
Don't rush him.

00:34.201 --> 00:35.536
He's an artist.

00:35.578 --> 00:37.288
HESBY:
Yeah, I am.

00:37.329 --> 00:39.498
Okay. Uh...

00:41.375 --> 00:46.172
When Gloria commissioned me,
we started an artistic journey

00:46.213 --> 00:48.799
and journeys
need to be respected.

00:48.841 --> 00:51.886
All right, now, before you
make the biggest mistake

00:51.927 --> 00:54.305
of your life,
just check out this video.

00:54.346 --> 00:57.391
This is Cynthia playing
Beethoven on a motorcycle.

00:57.433 --> 00:59.185
Check that.

01:01.061 --> 01:03.314
Hesby is not impressed
by your scooter gimmicks.

01:03.355 --> 01:04.857
300,000 hits.

01:04.899 --> 01:08.444
And you notice,
the ceiling was still intact.

01:08.486 --> 01:10.946
Well, I thought the collapse
was beautiful.

01:10.988 --> 01:13.616
I mean, the chaos and the Pope.

01:15.075 --> 01:17.328
Yeah, I couldn't agree
with you more.

01:17.369 --> 01:19.121
THOMAS: L-Listen, what
we're doing here-- Hesby!

01:19.163 --> 01:20.664
Hmm?

01:20.706 --> 01:23.334
We are reimagining
what an orchestra is.

01:23.375 --> 01:24.502
I mean, what music is.

01:24.543 --> 01:26.670
-Oh.

01:26.712 --> 01:30.132
-Nothing.
-This is the résistance.

01:30.174 --> 01:32.384
GLORIA: Uh, what are you
resisting exactly?

01:32.426 --> 01:34.136
-THOMAS: Oh, hilarious.

01:34.178 --> 01:37.890
Wouldn't you want 1,200 people
to hear it, not 20?

01:37.932 --> 01:40.476
1,200 blue-rinse old biddies.

01:40.518 --> 01:41.769
-I'm speaking -GLORIA: What are
you talking about?

01:41.811 --> 01:43.312
to the next generation.

01:43.354 --> 01:45.481
Both of you are making
perfect sense to me.

01:45.523 --> 01:49.109
-Yeah, ah.

01:49.151 --> 01:50.569
-No walks.
-Yeah, yeah.

01:50.611 --> 01:53.072
-No, I'm not walking!
-GLORIA: Follow me.

01:53.113 --> 01:55.491
-HESBY: I love walks.

02:04.208 --> 02:06.502
-It sounds...
-Wonderful.

02:06.544 --> 02:09.547
...like a dystopian nightmare.

02:13.133 --> 02:15.845
It's exactly the feeling
I want to convey.

02:15.886 --> 02:18.722
It's-it's-it's terrifying.

02:18.764 --> 02:20.140
Really?

02:20.182 --> 02:21.892
I'm not scared.

02:33.153 --> 02:37.408
Why-why-why is it that you
cannot play with the blood

02:38.909 --> 02:40.119
Why?

02:40.160 --> 02:43.414
I'm not sure what
you want me to do, Maestro.

02:43.455 --> 02:45.457
I don't know. I-I don't know.

02:45.499 --> 02:46.834
I don't know what to do
and that's the problem.

02:46.876 --> 02:48.502
Maes-Maestro, please.

02:48.544 --> 02:50.004
Cálmete.

02:50.045 --> 02:51.463
Yeah, I'm-I'm fine.

02:51.505 --> 02:53.132
I'm-I'm trying... come.

02:53.173 --> 02:55.968
Could I borrow your oboe
for a second?

02:56.010 --> 02:57.052
Please.

02:57.094 --> 03:00.347
This is his process.

03:00.389 --> 03:03.309
He's an artist.

03:03.350 --> 03:06.854
I think I-I learned
how to play this

03:06.896 --> 03:10.649
through osmosis with Hai Lai.

03:30.544 --> 03:33.464
Uh, Maestro,

03:33.505 --> 03:35.674
perhaps it's time for a break.

03:35.716 --> 03:37.301
Right, Bob?

03:37.343 --> 03:40.638
Uh, it's not actually,
but, uh, let's take one.

03:40.679 --> 03:42.014
-Ten.

03:42.056 --> 03:43.557
Give Arlen back his oboe.

03:43.599 --> 03:45.017
No, no, no. No, Gloria, no. No.

03:45.059 --> 03:46.769
All right. All right,
all right, Maestro.

03:46.810 --> 03:48.270
Okay, we'll-we'll get it,
we'll get it back to you.

03:49.897 --> 03:52.733
There's a little business matter
I just need you to pinpoint.

03:52.775 --> 03:56.695
Well, I think your piece
is in really good hands.

03:58.697 --> 04:00.532
What's wrong?

04:00.574 --> 04:03.202
I need your phone
'cause I have to call Hai Lai.

04:03.243 --> 04:04.620
I called her
from Dee Dee's phone.

04:04.662 --> 04:06.038
I called her
from Warren Boyd's phone.

04:06.080 --> 04:07.289
I called her from a taxi phone.

04:07.331 --> 04:09.041
I called her
from-from her phone.

04:09.083 --> 04:10.209
I-I cannot find her.

04:10.250 --> 04:13.128
Well, is she all right?

04:16.882 --> 04:19.885
She doesn't want to be
my girlfriend anymore.

04:22.680 --> 04:27.226
I... I-I'm so sorry.

04:27.267 --> 04:29.770
But...

04:29.812 --> 04:33.065
I need you to tell Hesby
that you're the person

04:33.107 --> 04:36.276
to conduct his piece
and if you do,

04:36.318 --> 04:38.195
I'll forgive you for Japan.

04:40.906 --> 04:42.574
Can I have some maté?

04:44.034 --> 04:45.786
Sharon, could you?

04:45.828 --> 04:47.538
Of course.

04:47.579 --> 04:49.289
And if you need anything,

04:49.331 --> 04:51.500
-anything at all, I'm available.
-Sharon.

04:51.542 --> 04:52.876
-Yes.
-Make the maté.

04:52.918 --> 04:54.545
-Now... Oh, Hesby.

04:54.586 --> 04:58.257
Hesby, Rodrigo was
just saying how emotional

04:58.298 --> 05:00.134
this piece has made him.

05:00.175 --> 05:03.178
Oh, thank you,
thank you so much.

05:03.220 --> 05:04.680
I... you know, I cried

05:04.722 --> 05:06.807
for 39 hours straight
while I wrote it.

05:06.849 --> 05:11.145
Well, Hesby Enis,
I think there is no question.

05:11.186 --> 05:13.022
You should give this piece
to Thomas

05:13.063 --> 05:15.607
because he plays with the blood.
Yeah.

05:15.649 --> 05:17.109
I am just a substance,

05:17.151 --> 05:18.861
a substance that
cannot be defined.

05:18.902 --> 05:20.362
Thomas, he-he plays
with the blood.

05:20.404 --> 05:21.822
GLORIA:
Rodrigo, come back!

05:21.864 --> 05:23.657
He's just joking.

05:23.699 --> 05:25.617
He's just... he's so funny.

05:27.077 --> 05:29.371
I don't like giving
people bad news,

05:29.413 --> 05:32.332
-so I'm just gonna go
for a walk. -Oh.

05:36.336 --> 05:37.588
I'm done.

05:37.629 --> 05:39.715
What do you mean, you're done?

05:39.757 --> 05:44.136
Don't come home tonight.

05:44.178 --> 05:45.763
-Wha...
-Don't.

05:48.015 --> 05:52.144
Getting notes of cardboard
and plastic.

05:52.186 --> 05:56.815
Well, 2015 was a good year.

05:56.857 --> 05:59.777
Don't go back to the Ferndale.
Live upstairs.

05:59.818 --> 06:03.238
You can conduct downstairs and
drink on this glorious beach.

06:03.280 --> 06:04.490
You never have to leave.

06:04.531 --> 06:05.991
We can just grow
old together, Hail.

06:06.033 --> 06:08.786
I really have to get back
to normal life.

06:08.827 --> 06:11.080
I also really have
to talk to Rodrigo.

06:11.121 --> 06:12.831
You still haven't talked to him?

06:12.873 --> 06:14.416
You guys just, like,
broke up at the tea ceremony

06:14.458 --> 06:15.626
-Yeah.

06:15.667 --> 06:18.420
No Mr. Boyfriend,
no cohabitation,

06:18.462 --> 06:20.923
things are just gonna be normal.

06:20.964 --> 06:22.466
Which is not normal, Hail.

06:22.508 --> 06:24.468
Shut up.

06:24.510 --> 06:28.347
Oh, motorcycle guy and Arlen.

06:28.388 --> 06:29.723
-Danny.
-Hey. -Hey.

06:29.765 --> 06:31.600
You guys know each other?

06:31.642 --> 06:34.103
Uh, no, we just arrived
at the same time.

06:34.144 --> 06:35.479
-DANNY: Hello.
-LIZZIE: Hi.

06:35.521 --> 06:38.524
Hey.

06:38.565 --> 06:40.359
Oh, yeah, this is happening,
by the way.

06:40.400 --> 06:41.693
Okay.

06:41.735 --> 06:43.654
Do you guys want some
boxed Pinot?

06:43.695 --> 06:45.572
-Yeah, please.
-Uh, uh, no thanks.

06:45.614 --> 06:46.990
I'm-I'm good.

06:47.032 --> 06:48.492
Hey, sorry to crash your
sidewalk party, but, uh,

06:48.534 --> 06:50.494
I just wanted to tell you
in person

06:50.536 --> 06:51.954
that I quit the orchestra.

06:51.995 --> 06:53.247
Wait, you quit?

06:53.288 --> 06:54.706
Well, I want to quit,

06:54.748 --> 06:56.375
but they'll only let me
out of my contract

06:56.416 --> 06:58.001
if I find a sub
that Rodrigo approves

06:58.043 --> 06:59.294
and you're the only sub
he'll approve.

06:59.336 --> 07:00.796
Wait, why do you want to quit?

07:00.838 --> 07:03.340
I keep having these nightmares
where Rodrigo

07:03.382 --> 07:04.800
is trying to stab me
with an oboe,

07:04.842 --> 07:06.593
so I'm just gonna
go back to Chicago

07:06.635 --> 07:08.428
and I-I-I am gonna have one
of those wines, if that's okay.

07:08.470 --> 07:10.389
Sure, but, dude,
she's not gonna sub for you.

07:10.430 --> 07:12.182
She's got this whole thing
about orbits.

07:12.224 --> 07:13.642
No, I'll do it.

07:13.684 --> 07:14.810
Oh, God, thank you.

07:14.852 --> 07:16.186
LIZZIE:
Really?

07:16.228 --> 07:18.021
There are no orbits anymore.

07:18.063 --> 07:19.731
You sure about this?

07:19.773 --> 07:21.400
Yeah. I want things
to be normal.

07:21.441 --> 07:23.569
Me subbing is normal.

07:27.447 --> 07:29.533
Okay. Um...

07:29.575 --> 07:31.785
Let's connect
to our breath, okay?

07:31.827 --> 07:33.829
So, in...  ...and out.

07:33.871 --> 07:35.706
Down bow, up...

07:35.747 --> 07:37.916
Hey, hey, flutes.
Cut it out.

07:37.958 --> 07:40.669
-They're out of control, Cyn.
-RICKY: Stop.

07:40.711 --> 07:42.546
Those are very expensive
instruments.

07:42.588 --> 07:44.506
This is a very important man
and he's here to help.

07:44.548 --> 07:46.008
Thank you, Ricky.

07:46.049 --> 07:49.469
You have got to learn
how to take criticism.

07:49.511 --> 07:52.431
Literally, that's how
your entire career will be.

07:52.472 --> 07:54.933
Violinists don't cry.

07:54.975 --> 07:56.894
Violists cry.

07:56.935 --> 07:58.228
You want to be a violist?

07:58.270 --> 07:59.354
No.

07:59.396 --> 08:00.731
You're very talented.

08:00.772 --> 08:02.649
That's why I'm being tough
with you.

08:02.691 --> 08:05.611
When I'm nice to you then
you'll know you have a problem.

08:05.652 --> 08:08.363
Okay, let's go.

08:08.405 --> 08:10.032
Hello, hello, hello.

08:10.073 --> 08:13.035
-Maestro.
-Ah, the boss.

08:13.076 --> 08:14.828
Yes. How's the wrist?

08:14.870 --> 08:17.497
-I'm gonna have to learn
to bow lefty. -Ah, cool.

08:17.539 --> 08:19.249
Like Jimi Hendrix.
That's-that's okay.

08:19.291 --> 08:21.001
Well, kind of joking.

08:21.043 --> 08:23.212
I-I'm in rehab and
it's not gonna recover fully,

08:23.253 --> 08:24.796
maybe, fully.

08:24.838 --> 08:26.340
Oh, shit.

08:26.381 --> 08:27.507
I'm sorry.

08:27.549 --> 08:28.717
I'm sorry, wrist.

08:28.759 --> 08:30.177
Did I do this to you?

08:30.219 --> 08:32.346
Don't answer, don't answer,
don't answer.

08:32.386 --> 08:33.679
CYNTHIA:
Uh, you're here to teach?

08:33.722 --> 08:35.057
Yes, I'm here to teach

08:35.097 --> 08:37.558
and to learn and to teach
about the blood

08:37.601 --> 08:39.561
with this wonderful, wonderful,
wonderful kids.

08:39.602 --> 08:42.147
Look at you, you so lovely.

08:42.188 --> 08:44.524
Even though I don't know you,
I love you so much.

08:44.566 --> 08:46.318
So much!

08:46.360 --> 08:47.945
So, um, it is, uh...

08:50.530 --> 08:52.491
Okay, but let's, um,
let's do it, okay?

08:52.532 --> 08:53.742
Oh.

08:53.784 --> 08:55.410
My hands are made of
banana pudding.

08:55.452 --> 08:57.537
It's like...
Okay.

08:57.579 --> 09:00.540
Where have you been? You haven't
been here for, like, a month.

09:00.582 --> 09:02.209
Ricky, I've been working. Okay?

09:02.251 --> 09:04.878
I've been in Japan,
I went to the moon,

09:04.920 --> 09:06.713
I went down
to the bottom of the ocean,

09:06.755 --> 09:08.548
and I killed a robot
with my hands.

09:08.590 --> 09:10.634
Okay?

09:14.680 --> 09:17.224
D-Don't look at me like that.

09:17.266 --> 09:19.851
Maestro, what if we play
the start of the Fifth for you?

09:19.893 --> 09:21.353
No, no, no. They have
to listen to the story.

09:21.395 --> 09:23.814
They have to.

09:23.855 --> 09:25.232
When I was a young boy,

09:25.274 --> 09:27.442
Maestro Rivera came to me
and said,

09:27.484 --> 09:31.738
"Play every single instrument
except the violin."

09:31.780 --> 09:33.532
And so, I tried
to prove him wrong.

09:33.573 --> 09:36.535
And I grabbed the violin,
and I practiced day and night.

09:36.576 --> 09:39.037
Day and night, till blood
was coming out from this finger,

09:39.079 --> 09:41.248
from this finger,
from this finger, this finger.

09:41.290 --> 09:42.958
All the time,
blood was just coming out,

09:43.000 --> 09:44.251
it was just starting to flow.

09:44.293 --> 09:45.877
-GIRL: Ew!

09:45.919 --> 09:47.462
RODRIGO:
Ew? Well, yeah, ew!

09:47.504 --> 09:49.673
Yes, of course, yes.
But that is the blood

09:49.715 --> 09:51.425
of the sublimity of the hand!

09:51.466 --> 09:52.634
-Maestro. -Okay, come on.
-You know, it is something

09:52.676 --> 09:54.261
that needs to happen
in everything.

09:54.303 --> 09:56.763
-I want to see-- next time,
I want to see blood... -Maestro.

09:56.805 --> 09:58.056
-Maestro, why don't...
-Let's-let's, uh,

09:58.098 --> 10:00.058
Why don't you tell us
about the blood outside?

10:00.100 --> 10:01.935
Okay.

10:04.187 --> 10:08.150
And this is where the tour ends.

10:08.191 --> 10:10.944
The Kandinsky gallery.

10:10.986 --> 10:13.155
Possibly,
Solomon R. Guggenheim's

10:13.196 --> 10:14.489
favorite abstract painter.

10:14.531 --> 10:16.700
Ah. And mine.

10:16.742 --> 10:19.202
Then you can't say no,
then, can you?

10:19.244 --> 10:21.413
I'm not.

10:21.455 --> 10:23.790
When do we celebrate?

10:23.832 --> 10:26.251
-Wonderful.
I'll grab some paperwork

10:26.293 --> 10:27.836
and some very
expensive champagne.

10:27.878 --> 10:29.254
-Fabulous.
-I'll be right back.

10:43.727 --> 10:46.313
THOMAS:
Gloria.

10:46.355 --> 10:48.065
What the hell are you doing?

10:48.106 --> 10:49.775
How did you find me?

10:49.816 --> 10:51.401
We share a calendar together.

10:51.443 --> 10:52.611
Remember?

10:52.652 --> 10:54.237
I'll have Sharon correct that.

10:54.279 --> 10:55.697
Congratulations!

10:55.739 --> 10:57.532
You've won. I'm taking the job.

10:57.574 --> 10:59.493
You don't even like modern art!

10:59.534 --> 11:00.702
I like it fine.

11:00.744 --> 11:03.080
Hesby gave you the piece.

11:03.121 --> 11:06.083
I have nothing, except
a conductor who's falling apart,

11:06.124 --> 11:09.252
and a corporate sponsor
who's furious at me

11:09.294 --> 11:10.504
because of said conductor.

11:10.545 --> 11:13.048
So, you were right
about Rodrigo.

11:13.090 --> 11:14.549
You were right about everything.

11:14.591 --> 11:15.759
You win.

11:15.801 --> 11:17.260
Please, don't give up.

11:18.595 --> 11:20.764
This is the way it works.
I come at you,

11:20.806 --> 11:23.058
you come back at me, goddamnit!

11:23.100 --> 11:25.602
-I'm too tired.
-All right.

11:25.644 --> 11:28.647
You're right. Yeah.
You should quit.

11:28.688 --> 11:30.774
You've turned the symphony
into a mausoleum anyway.

11:30.816 --> 11:34.361
Oh, don't you try
to reverse psychology me.

11:34.403 --> 11:37.030
You are a musical genius.

11:37.072 --> 11:38.198
-Oh, please. Ugh.
-I mean it.

11:38.240 --> 11:39.491
Every young conductor

11:39.533 --> 11:41.701
and instrumentalist
in the country

11:41.743 --> 11:43.662
vies for your approval.

11:43.703 --> 11:46.665
Why do you think I'm getting
such great reviews?

11:46.706 --> 11:48.834
It's because of your disdain.

11:48.875 --> 11:53.797
Well, lucky you, because there's
no limit to my disdain!

11:53.839 --> 11:55.674
-You think you're innovating
music

11:55.715 --> 11:59.219
There's a reason you got your
instruments from a dumpster.

11:59.261 --> 12:01.972
You're such an uptown snob.

12:02.013 --> 12:04.224
Well, fuck you.

12:04.266 --> 12:06.226
This war is good for both of us.

12:06.268 --> 12:08.812
This war is good for music.

12:08.854 --> 12:11.022
I need you to fight.

12:20.073 --> 12:23.702
Mm...

12:23.743 --> 12:25.328
-Oh!

12:25.370 --> 12:28.331
So, can I come home now?

12:28.373 --> 12:29.875
No. Mm...

12:29.916 --> 12:31.042
I think so.

12:31.084 --> 12:32.461
Mm, no.

12:32.502 --> 12:34.045
-Mm-mm.

12:35.630 --> 12:37.007
GLORIA:
Oh.

12:37.048 --> 12:38.800
Shall I bring another glass?

12:38.842 --> 12:40.010
THOMAS:
Mm...

12:40.051 --> 12:43.555
We need to talk.

12:44.764 --> 12:45.807
Sebastian.

12:45.849 --> 12:48.268
SEBASTIAN:
Hmm?

12:48.310 --> 12:50.896
Now, do you remember I told you
you could borrow this mug

12:50.937 --> 12:52.105
whenever you wanted to?

12:52.147 --> 12:54.274
Um...

12:54.316 --> 12:56.610
You can have it.

12:56.651 --> 12:58.111
And Shawn.

12:58.153 --> 13:02.532
This walnut was given to me
by Seiji Ozawa.

13:02.574 --> 13:05.577
Do not eat it. Do not open it.

13:05.619 --> 13:08.205
-I never will. -Listen, mate,
we don't need any more rent.

13:08.246 --> 13:09.831
No, no, but this
is not the rent.

13:09.873 --> 13:12.125
This is just gifts
from me to you. That's it.

13:12.167 --> 13:13.877
I don't want anything
in the world anymore, you know?

13:13.919 --> 13:15.504
You know? I don't want to have
any possession,

13:15.545 --> 13:17.756
any things, anymore.
I just want to be...

13:17.797 --> 13:20.509
I just want to be a shadow
in front of the orchestra.

13:20.550 --> 13:21.927
That's all I want.

13:37.901 --> 13:39.277
How do you like
this violin sound?

13:39.319 --> 13:40.820
Uh, it sounds fantastic.

13:40.862 --> 13:42.656
I actually thought
we were listening to your album.

13:42.697 --> 13:44.658
This is an amazing instrument.

13:44.699 --> 13:46.076
You sure you want to give it up?

13:46.117 --> 13:47.953
Of course. Absolutely.
To you

13:47.994 --> 13:49.913
-Thank you.
-Please.

13:49.955 --> 13:51.081
-Of course.

13:51.122 --> 13:52.499
-All right. Yes.
-We have to.

13:52.541 --> 13:54.376
Drinks and all the...
rest of the things.

13:54.417 --> 13:55.585
Yeah, everything, yes.

13:55.627 --> 13:56.711
Yes. We do everything.

13:56.753 --> 13:58.088
Next time.

13:58.129 --> 14:00.090
-Ah, yes.

14:00.131 --> 14:02.968
-SEBASTIAN: We have guests,

14:03.009 --> 14:06.263
or I'm tripping my balls off.

14:06.304 --> 14:08.515
Maestro, you called?

14:08.557 --> 14:11.560
Ah! Norton Morton, Norton, yes.

14:11.601 --> 14:13.103
Look what I have for you.

14:13.144 --> 14:15.230
For example,

14:15.272 --> 14:18.525
this is my football
that I slept with

14:18.567 --> 14:20.819
from the ages
of ten to 13 and a half.

14:20.860 --> 14:23.154
-You can have that.
-And why are you distributing

14:23.196 --> 14:24.489
your worldly possessions?

14:24.531 --> 14:26.241
He just broke up
with his girlfriend.

14:26.283 --> 14:28.034
Oh. The foul-mouthed oboist.

14:28.076 --> 14:29.369
This requires absinthe.

14:29.411 --> 14:31.162
-Yes.

14:31.204 --> 14:32.706
:
Thank you.

14:32.747 --> 14:35.875
Wormwood, wormwood.

14:37.085 --> 14:38.420
Can I have some?

14:38.461 --> 14:39.963
To heartbreak,

14:40.005 --> 14:42.299
that most exquisite pain.

14:42.340 --> 14:44.259
To perplexity.

14:44.301 --> 14:47.095
To longing.

14:47.137 --> 14:50.974
To having a family.

14:51.016 --> 14:53.018
I don't want to do
this cheers anymore.

14:53.059 --> 14:56.855
Maestro, this is beneath you.

14:56.896 --> 14:59.899
You are the only living
conductor in my collection.

14:59.941 --> 15:02.944
What is one oboist
to the millions who adore you?

15:02.986 --> 15:06.364
-Uh...
-To Rodrigo De-fucking-Sousa.

15:08.408 --> 15:10.076
Norton, thank you.

15:10.118 --> 15:12.454
Sebastian. Page.

15:12.495 --> 15:14.497
So, are we having a party?

15:14.539 --> 15:16.041
Can I invite people?

15:16.082 --> 15:17.459
Call the choir.

15:17.500 --> 15:19.377
-WOMAN: Mm-hmm.
-Keep your hat on.

15:19.419 --> 15:21.796
I've got big plans today.

15:21.838 --> 15:24.215
Everybody's gonna be working
very late, though.

15:24.257 --> 15:25.759
That's the only thing.

15:25.800 --> 15:28.094
But... Huh, I wonder
what's going on.

15:28.136 --> 15:31.264
Is this the fantastic orchestra
you've been telling me about?

15:31.306 --> 15:32.807
Where is everyone?

15:32.849 --> 15:35.435
ALAN: The union received
an anonymous tip

15:35.477 --> 15:37.228
that we're a non-union orchestra

15:37.270 --> 15:39.939
-with union players.

15:39.981 --> 15:42.400
And now, they're threatening
to blacklist all our players

15:42.442 --> 15:45.320
unless we become a union shop.

15:45.362 --> 15:48.156
Wow, Hesby Ennis.

15:48.198 --> 15:50.742
-Ha. -I grew up listening
to your Polaria Symphony.

15:50.784 --> 15:52.786
Well, I'm so sorry.

15:52.827 --> 15:54.829
I hope there wasn't any
permanent damage done to you.

15:57.874 --> 15:59.042
Are you kidding me?

15:59.084 --> 16:00.919
I'm scabbing?

16:00.960 --> 16:02.087
ALAN:
Why are you smiling?

16:02.128 --> 16:04.422
Why is he smiling?

16:04.464 --> 16:07.592
Oh, bloody fantastic.

16:07.634 --> 16:09.010
-Now you're laughing.

16:09.052 --> 16:10.970
-Now he's laughing.
-You're laughing.

16:11.012 --> 16:12.639
You're not upset?

16:12.681 --> 16:14.766
Of course I'm upset,
I'm furious.

16:14.808 --> 16:17.185
My God, Gloria.

16:17.227 --> 16:19.145
Wait, your girlfriend
reported us?

16:19.187 --> 16:21.272
Of course she did.

16:21.314 --> 16:23.733
She may not be my girlfriend
for much longer.

16:23.775 --> 16:26.111
Well, monogamy
is unnatural anyway.

16:26.152 --> 16:28.113
We all betray each other
in the end.

16:29.364 --> 16:33.076
Where's Hesby going?

16:33.118 --> 16:37.038
He's gonna give his piece
to Gloria, of course.

16:38.748 --> 16:40.041
SEBASTIAN:
Five, six, seven...

16:40.083 --> 16:41.334
RODRIGO:
Oh, no, no, don't go higher.

16:49.968 --> 16:52.262
You're killing the sound.

16:52.303 --> 16:55.682
I am Rodrigo...

16:55.724 --> 16:58.435
De-fucking-Sousa.

17:05.400 --> 17:06.776
Wow.

17:06.818 --> 17:08.611
So beautiful.

17:08.653 --> 17:11.906
So beautiful.
Thank you, thank...

17:13.116 --> 17:14.659
All right.

17:14.701 --> 17:16.786
WOMAN:
Wow.

17:16.828 --> 17:18.204
You're very beautiful.

17:18.246 --> 17:19.497
Thank you, Maestro.

17:19.539 --> 17:20.582
Why didn't they invite you
last time?

17:20.623 --> 17:21.665
Why

17:21.708 --> 17:23.001
-I don't know.
-Oh.

17:25.753 --> 17:29.257
We have to, um,
to exchange names.

17:29.299 --> 17:30.467
Yes.

17:38.141 --> 17:40.018
Shawn, help me with the box,
please.

17:40.059 --> 17:41.186
Let's start giving stuff.

17:54.949 --> 17:56.993
Ah, Joan Jett.
Come, come, Shawn.

17:57.035 --> 17:59.078
Shawn. Come, Shawn.

17:59.120 --> 18:01.039
-Joan Jett. Hey.
-Hi.

18:01.080 --> 18:02.165
-Rodrigo.

18:02.207 --> 18:03.291
I wanted to give you this.

18:03.333 --> 18:04.834
This is my first mixtape.

18:04.876 --> 18:06.586
I designed the cover myself.

18:06.628 --> 18:10.548
-You know, your Shostakovich
with the Berlin Phil... -Mm.

18:10.590 --> 18:13.009
...knocked the shit out of me.

18:13.051 --> 18:14.636
Ah, and you knock
the shit out of me

18:14.677 --> 18:17.013
with the terrible beauty
of your voice.

18:24.229 --> 18:25.647
Oh, my God, Nadia Sirota.

18:25.688 --> 18:27.065
I love you.

18:27.106 --> 18:28.900
Are you friends with Sebastian?

18:28.942 --> 18:32.403
Uh, no, Rodrigo asked me here
to give me a tuning fork

18:32.445 --> 18:34.531
that Kathleen Battle
threw at him.

18:34.572 --> 18:35.782
I don't know why.

18:35.824 --> 18:37.450
Rodrigo's here?

18:37.492 --> 18:39.118
-Hi.
-Hi.

18:39.160 --> 18:42.455
Oh.... oh, you, no, wait,
I forgot. I hate you.

18:42.497 --> 18:44.707
Please don't. I'm really sorry
about everything.

18:44.749 --> 18:46.334
Oh, yeah, well, you should be,

18:46.376 --> 18:48.586
but I'm over it.

18:48.628 --> 18:50.171
So, do you still live here?

18:50.213 --> 18:52.173
Uh, does Rodrigo?

18:52.215 --> 18:53.383
Hey, Jeff Zeigler.

18:53.424 --> 18:55.093
-Maestro, Maestro.
-Hey.

18:55.134 --> 18:56.886
It's so good to see you.
I want to give you something

18:56.928 --> 19:00.306
that I think you should have
ever since I met you.

19:00.348 --> 19:01.766
This pencil.

19:01.808 --> 19:04.018
I will also give you
this teacup.

19:04.060 --> 19:05.520
This is my grandmother's teacup.

19:05.562 --> 19:07.272
She used to read the future
in this.

19:07.313 --> 19:09.190
But it really doesn't work
because it has to be more like,

19:09.232 --> 19:12.068
uh, you know,
it'd old anyways, so...

19:12.110 --> 19:13.611
-JEFF: Whoa.

19:13.653 --> 19:14.988
What's wrong with him?

19:15.029 --> 19:17.031
I think it's you.

19:18.992 --> 19:21.035
:
Okay.

19:29.919 --> 19:31.379
Ray Chen?

19:31.421 --> 19:32.589
Yeah, yeah.

19:32.630 --> 19:33.923
HAILEY: Okay,
could you please leave?

19:33.965 --> 19:35.466
-This is my room.
-RAY: Oh. Oh, yeah. Of course.

19:35.508 --> 19:38.136
-Of course.
-Thanks.

19:50.189 --> 19:52.150
RODRIGO:
...told you I stole a dime?

19:52.191 --> 19:53.902
No, I didn't tell you that?

19:53.943 --> 19:56.404
-No. -Ah, come on.
I told you when-when...

19:56.446 --> 19:58.281
Don't mind me. I'm just leaving.

19:58.323 --> 20:02.660
I... Hai Lai, I want to present
you to-to, uh, Esmerelda.

20:02.702 --> 20:04.162
-She's a singer.
-Hi.

20:04.203 --> 20:07.790
-Really good.
-Nice to meet you.

20:07.832 --> 20:10.501
Do you mind taking a seat,
Esmerelda, here, okay?

20:10.543 --> 20:11.586
Don't leave, please.

20:11.628 --> 20:13.713
I'll be back in a minute, okay?

20:13.755 --> 20:16.925
Hai Lai, Hai Lai, wait, wait.

20:16.966 --> 20:19.135
I'm giving my stuff away
and I wanted to see

20:19.177 --> 20:21.179
if you wanted this because this
is my grandmother's.

20:21.220 --> 20:23.932
-I don't want it.
-'Cause I want you to...

20:23.973 --> 20:26.517
Are-are you sad, are you mad
about the

20:26.559 --> 20:29.479
No, you can do whatever,
whoever you want.

20:29.520 --> 20:31.189
I don't care.

20:31.230 --> 20:33.358
Hai Lai, come on, if you're
not gonna talk to me,

20:33.399 --> 20:34.567
at least let me give you this

20:34.609 --> 20:35.944
because I want you
to think of me.

20:35.985 --> 20:37.695
I want you to think of me.

20:37.737 --> 20:39.280
Okay, and I just want to know

20:39.322 --> 20:41.366
if you're cool with me
subbing in tomorrow.

20:41.407 --> 20:42.867
Of course, Hai Lai.

20:42.909 --> 20:44.953
Abso... I'm completely fine
with that, yeah.

20:44.994 --> 20:48.122
You can sub anytime. I'm always
looking for you, Hai Lai.

20:48.164 --> 20:49.707
Whenever somebody else is
playing, I'm always like,

20:49.749 --> 20:50.917
"Where's Hai Lai?
Where-where's...

20:50.959 --> 20:52.710
where is she, where is she?"

20:52.752 --> 20:55.004
Because I only, you know,
I-I don't like how people sound.

20:55.046 --> 20:57.632
I like how you sound.
I like the sound of that...

20:57.674 --> 21:00.218
that-that you make that is like
a-a mother bird, you know,

21:00.259 --> 21:02.220
-regurgitating into the
little baby. -Oh, my God.

21:02.261 --> 21:03.388
Would you please
stop saying things

21:03.429 --> 21:05.682
that make no fucking sense?!

21:05.723 --> 21:07.642
Like, "Play with the blood,
play with the blood."

21:07.684 --> 21:10.853
Or, "You're gonna win. You're
a great conductor, Hai Lai."

21:10.895 --> 21:12.563
Well, you want to hear something
that makes sense?!

21:12.605 --> 21:14.482
You're never gonna be
a great conductor, Hai Lai!

21:14.524 --> 21:16.025
Never! Nunca. Jamais.

21:16.067 --> 21:17.652
And you know why?

21:17.694 --> 21:19.320
Because you're listening
to me all the time,

21:19.362 --> 21:20.697
and you're listening to Thomas,

21:20.738 --> 21:22.240
and you're listening
to your father

21:22.281 --> 21:24.492
and you have to stop that.
Listen to the music!

21:24.534 --> 21:26.119
Just play with the music!

21:26.160 --> 21:27.954
Okay? Just fucking play
with the blood, Hai Lai!

21:27.996 --> 21:29.247
Fuck you!

21:29.288 --> 21:31.165
I do play with the blood!

21:37.296 --> 21:40.299
:
Chingada madre.

21:46.472 --> 21:47.974
How was rehearsal?

21:48.016 --> 21:50.143
Oh, I think you know.

21:52.478 --> 21:54.230
I can't do this anymore.

21:54.272 --> 21:56.107
What are you saying?

21:56.149 --> 21:59.277
Maybe what we have,
it's just not working.

21:59.318 --> 22:01.779
Ah, come on.

22:01.821 --> 22:03.489
I am fighting.

22:03.531 --> 22:07.785
I thought this is what
you wanted, you crazy person.

22:11.748 --> 22:14.917
Oh, no, really?

22:16.252 --> 22:18.296
Will you be my wife?

22:18.337 --> 22:22.592
This is a ploy to get
the piece back, isn't it?

22:22.633 --> 22:26.095
No. It's a ploy...

22:26.137 --> 22:29.932
to get to sleep with you again

22:29.974 --> 22:31.726
and again and again.

22:31.768 --> 22:35.313
I told you I'm glad
we aren't married.

22:38.107 --> 22:42.653
Well, I always love
to disappoint you.

22:42.695 --> 22:44.530
Come on, luv.

22:46.783 --> 22:49.535
Mm, no.

22:49.577 --> 22:52.955
So you throw away a perfectly
wonderful relationship

22:52.997 --> 22:56.042
just because I've been
an asshole?

22:56.084 --> 22:57.919
I'm not breaking up with you,

22:57.960 --> 23:01.547
but I'm not giving you
an insurance policy.

23:01.589 --> 23:04.759
You're going to have to stop
being an asshole, Thomas.

23:04.801 --> 23:08.304
I'm not sure I can.

23:08.346 --> 23:12.391
Look, I crashed and burned
with four husbands, so...

23:12.433 --> 23:15.353
you're not the only one who
needs to turn over a new leaf.

23:15.394 --> 23:17.730
Well, let me be
Thomas the Fifth.

23:17.772 --> 23:19.649
Sounds so regal.

23:19.690 --> 23:21.651
You can...

23:21.692 --> 23:24.570
sleep at my place tonight.

23:24.612 --> 23:25.905
Mm.

23:25.947 --> 23:29.909
But no to the other thing.

23:29.951 --> 23:33.496
EGON:
Five, six, seven, eight.

23:33.538 --> 23:35.957
(upbeat classical-pop
music playing)

23:54.976 --> 23:56.602
Hey, but no. Hey, no, no, no.

23:56.644 --> 23:57.687
No, no, no. That's enough.

23:57.728 --> 23:59.230
Hey, stop. No.

23:59.272 --> 24:00.857
Oh, look who's back.

24:00.898 --> 24:02.817
Mischa, you owe me 20 bucks.

24:02.859 --> 24:04.110
What's happening here?

24:04.152 --> 24:06.320
Pablo? Pablo Heres-Casado.

24:06.362 --> 24:09.490
Sí, soy yo.
Rodrigo DeSousa.

24:09.532 --> 24:11.200
-Sí.
-Welcome.

24:11.242 --> 24:13.077
Yeah.

24:13.119 --> 24:14.328
I-I like your work a lot.

24:14.370 --> 24:16.038
I like it. It's really...

24:16.080 --> 24:18.374
uh, so, you know,
sometimes it's kind of...

24:18.416 --> 24:20.209
but would you, would you mind
just leaving right now

24:20.251 --> 24:21.460
because this is my dance.

24:21.502 --> 24:23.588
Yeah, thank you.
Pablo, please stay.

24:23.629 --> 24:25.715
-Yes, you know what, you quit.
!

24:25.756 --> 24:29.802
And I found a newer, hotter,
more-dedicated you.

24:29.844 --> 24:32.763
So just walk away.
Let's go back to one.

24:32.805 --> 24:34.682
RODRIGO: Hey, Egon, no, come on.
Egon, please.

24:34.724 --> 24:35.975
Please. You were right.

24:36.017 --> 24:37.435
You were right about everything,

24:37.476 --> 24:40.229
about-about the whole orchestra
thing, about me,

24:40.271 --> 24:42.356
about the drowning.
I'm drowning.

24:42.398 --> 24:43.900
Why are you drowning

24:43.941 --> 24:46.360
I don't know!
Egon, I don't know.

24:46.402 --> 24:48.613
If you don't know why,
I have no time for you.

24:48.654 --> 24:50.031
RODRIGO:
No, come on, please.

24:50.072 --> 24:52.408
I-I am the Faust.
I am, I am Faust.

24:52.450 --> 24:55.453
I am the character!
He's not Faust. I'm Faust!

24:55.494 --> 24:57.580
Oh, yeah, you're Faust.
You're just not my Faust.

24:57.622 --> 24:58.998
So, please leave.
We're rehearsing.

24:59.040 --> 25:00.166
I'm staying here!

25:00.208 --> 25:03.252
Fine. Guys, Pablo,
please, let's go.

25:03.294 --> 25:04.545
I'm so sorry.

25:11.552 --> 25:14.472
EGON:
I'm terribly sorry.

25:14.513 --> 25:16.974
("Piano Concerto No. 18 in
B

25:23.731 --> 25:25.566
Wolfgang!

25:25.608 --> 25:27.693
Piece of scheisse!
