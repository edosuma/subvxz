01:23.941 --> 01:25.985
there's a difference between
bands and "girl bands"? No way.

01:43.795 --> 01:45.713
Well, it's at a place called The Trap Door,

01:45.797 --> 01:47.131
and I guess you could come

01:47.214 --> 01:49.133
if you give me an advance on
my allowance for a new outfit.

01:49.216 --> 01:51.218

- I mean, it could be a hang-out.
- As if. You guys always flirt.

04:44.851 --> 04:46.310
Tiny flirts with everyone.

04:46.393 --> 04:47.895
She's right.

online. Give me your phone.

04:50.481 --> 04:51.733
Okay.

04:53.943 --> 04:55.152

"Did you know there's a species of
jellyfish that can live forever?"

04:59.115 --> 05:01.450

- Is that code for something?

Tiny's a catch. Why
aren't you more excited?

Okay, here's the slogan.

10:59.266 --> 11:01.143

11:01.227 --> 11:02.979

11:07.191 --> 11:09.235
Maya, what're you doing?

11:10.569 --> 11:13.572
Would you mind going to the back
so everyone else can hear the music?

11:13.655 --> 11:15.324
I can stand where I want.

11:16.242 --> 11:19.578
Some girl's on her period. [laughs]

11:19.661 --> 11:22.414
[scoffs] Hi. Could he call you later?

11:22.498 --> 11:23.874
Thanks.

11:23.957 --> 11:25.917
You can't stop me from
talking on my phone, bitch.

11:26.002 --> 11:28.129
[scoffs] Think again.

11:28.212 --> 11:29.838
- [man 2] Ooh!
- [woman] Thank God!

11:32.841 --> 11:33.842
[sighs]

11:33.925 --> 11:35.136
[woman cheers]

11:39.306 --> 11:41.183
Guess we'll never play that club again.

11:41.267 --> 11:44.270
Couldn't Maya contain her crazy
till after the first chorus?

11:47.731 --> 11:49.316
I need girl talk. Now.

11:49.400 --> 11:50.901
I'm kinda in the middle of something.

11:50.984 --> 11:52.861
You can eat Grace's muffin later.

11:54.363 --> 11:56.448
Did you... break a nail? [chuckles]

11:56.532 --> 11:58.742
- No, there's a new man in my life.
- Goodnight kiss?

11:58.825 --> 12:01.328
Goodnight make-out. And then some.

12:01.412 --> 12:03.997
- He reminds me of myself.
- That's called narcissism.

12:04.081 --> 12:07.251
No, not like that. He's
like... me before all the crap.

12:07.334 --> 12:08.460
Before Miles.

12:08.544 --> 12:10.671
But he hasn't messaged me yet.

12:10.754 --> 12:13.590
No "Mr. President, I wanna be your vice."

12:13.674 --> 12:16.885
The X-rating is my cue to exit.

12:17.928 --> 12:19.930
- Did you check Hastygram DMs?
- Of course.

12:20.013 --> 12:21.223
- FaceRange?
- First place I looked.

12:21.307 --> 12:22.558
- E-mail?
- Is that a joke?

12:23.392 --> 12:25.894
Wait... isn't he in grade ten?

12:27.104 --> 12:28.397
[chuckles] OomfChat.

12:28.480 --> 12:29.565
[chuckles]

12:32.568 --> 12:33.944
[gasps] Here's one from Vijay.

12:34.027 --> 12:37.614
<i>Hi, Tris. Last night was F-U-N.</i>

12:37.698 --> 12:39.950
<i>Let's do it again sometime, 'kay?</i>

12:41.160 --> 12:42.161
What should I say back?

12:42.244 --> 12:44.037
Ask him if he's heard of texting?

12:44.121 --> 12:45.122
[chuckles]

12:49.793 --> 12:52.546
[speaking Mandarin]

12:54.173 --> 12:58.510
- I can't introduce Tiny to my parents.
- Because he's a drug dealer?

12:58.594 --> 13:00.011
Ex-drug dealer.

13:00.096 --> 13:01.930
- He got out of that gang.
- He's also been stabbed.

13:02.013 --> 13:04.225
- That was one time.
- That we know of.

13:04.308 --> 13:06.810
What if something happens
when we're on our date?

13:06.893 --> 13:08.687
That's all in the past.

13:08.770 --> 13:10.647
Any girl would die to hook up with Tiny.

13:10.731 --> 13:12.191
And he chose you.

13:13.400 --> 13:15.527
Define "hook up."

13:15.611 --> 13:18.739
Is something you will never
be asked in this class.

13:18.822 --> 13:21.200
- Sorry, Mrs. Lin.
- [Mrs. Lin] Don't be sorry.

13:21.283 --> 13:22.951
- Especially not in English.
- [students giggle]

13:24.661 --> 13:26.205
[whispers] Oh, my God.

13:26.288 --> 13:27.956
[sighs] Maybe if I
replace that guy's phone,

13:28.039 --> 13:29.750
Keith'll let us play again.

13:29.833 --> 13:31.793
If you apologize for defending yourself,

13:31.877 --> 13:33.587
you give guys permission
to treat you like crap.

13:33.670 --> 13:36.673
Except no one told you to
murder a paying customer's phone.

13:36.757 --> 13:40.093
Maya gets called a capital B,
and everyone's okay with this?

13:40.177 --> 13:42.138
[scoffs] Score one for
institutionalized misogyny.

13:42.221 --> 13:43.555
Ugh! I just wanna play music.

13:43.639 --> 13:45.557
To play music, you need to play nice,

13:45.641 --> 13:47.726
especially with the men
that control the industry.

13:47.809 --> 13:49.603
You know why there are so few girl bands?

13:49.686 --> 13:51.355
Because no one gives them the chance?

13:51.438 --> 13:53.232
Because it's harder for them.

13:54.150 --> 13:55.942
On that stage, you need thick skin.

13:56.026 --> 13:57.194
Maya can handle it.

13:57.278 --> 13:59.029
[scoffs] She broke pretty easy last night.

13:59.112 --> 14:01.072
- That jerk deserved it.
- Okay, that may be true,

14:01.157 --> 14:02.949
but you're the one who
jeopardized your gig.

14:03.033 --> 14:05.702
You're just a little girl who
can't keep her temper in check.

14:05.786 --> 14:07.120
"Just a girl."

14:07.204 --> 14:09.790
That attitude right there,
that's why you can't apologize.

14:09.873 --> 14:12.042
Yeah, but what about our big break?

14:12.125 --> 14:15.129
What's more important?
Your dreams or your pride?

14:15.212 --> 14:16.713
You only get one.

14:24.596 --> 14:26.640
I once had a student who failed this unit.

14:26.723 --> 14:29.893
She just couldn't cut it. [chuckles]

14:32.479 --> 14:33.939
You got this.

14:38.194 --> 14:39.236
[Shay sighs]

14:41.029 --> 14:42.072
[inhales]

14:42.156 --> 14:44.074
I can't go to the movie with you.

14:44.783 --> 14:45.784
Maybe another time?

14:46.452 --> 14:51.039
I have important goals...
and I can't have distractions.

14:51.122 --> 14:53.083
So I'm a distraction?

14:53.478 --> 14:55.688
I just need to keep looking forward.

14:56.587 --> 14:58.339
Apparently, so do I.

14:59.381 --> 15:02.008
Oh, look, you stabbed him in the heart.

15:07.598 --> 15:09.725
May I have it? Please?
It's really important.

15:09.808 --> 15:13.895
[sighs] Fine, but my tip better be huge.

15:17.399 --> 15:19.452
[Miles] Aw, is that for me?

15:20.151 --> 15:21.152
What are you doing here?

15:21.237 --> 15:22.696
Grabbing a bite. <i>Et toi?</i>

15:23.614 --> 15:26.450
Well, it's only right
that I be honest with you.

15:26.533 --> 15:28.619
I'm... dating someone new.

15:29.661 --> 15:32.831
- Golly gee, you're goin' steady, huh?
- Is he your soulmate?

15:32.914 --> 15:34.625
His name is Vijay.

15:34.708 --> 15:36.877
[chuckles] My brother's friend?

15:36.960 --> 15:39.796
- Robbing the cradle, huh, Tris?
- So you're allowed to date, but I'm not?

15:39.880 --> 15:41.507
Who's dating?

15:41.590 --> 15:44.092
- We have more of a sibling relationship.
- Mmm.

15:44.175 --> 15:46.052
- Right, bro?
- Sure thing, sis.

15:46.136 --> 15:48.179
- [giggles]
- [kissing loudly]

15:50.015 --> 15:52.434
Vomit. And really creepy.

15:52.518 --> 15:54.270
Well, I have a thing for weirdos.

15:55.604 --> 15:56.605
Oh!

15:57.523 --> 15:58.899
Hey, Miles.

15:58.982 --> 16:00.484
- Are you joining us?
- Yes, please.

16:00.567 --> 16:02.110
Absolutely not.

16:03.320 --> 16:04.738
Have fun on your date.

16:09.993 --> 16:11.370
Thank you.

16:13.038 --> 16:14.790
[sad pop song playing]

16:15.749 --> 16:17.293

16:35.769 --> 16:36.853
Whoa!

16:36.937 --> 16:38.814
What the heck is going on in here?

16:38.897 --> 16:41.775
[panting] I'm just doing
a little decluttering.

16:41.858 --> 16:44.445
Great idea, 'cause you're gonna
be spending a lot of time in here.

16:44.528 --> 16:45.862
If you don't wanna get caught sneaking out,

16:45.946 --> 16:47.656
don't get tagged in photos.

16:47.739 --> 16:50.367
No going out, no Zig, no band practice.

16:50.451 --> 16:52.744
Fine, because I'm not
doing music anymore anyways!

16:53.620 --> 16:54.955
[sighs]

16:55.038 --> 16:57.666
- What happened?
- [Maya sobbing]

16:59.876 --> 17:01.962
- I'm not talking about it.
- Maya...

17:02.963 --> 17:04.798
[sniffles] You know what,
Mom? You were right, okay?

17:04.881 --> 17:07.509
I'm just some stupid little
girl who can't handle anything!

17:07.593 --> 17:09.886
I never said that.

17:09.970 --> 17:14.098
Even that guy thought so at the
club after, like, eight seconds.

17:14.182 --> 17:16.310
- What guy?
- [sniffling]

17:16.393 --> 17:19.688
He said I wasn't good enough,
and maybe he's right. [sighs]

17:19.771 --> 17:22.608
Who said that? Did somebody hurt you?

17:22.691 --> 17:24.943
No, not physically, but...

17:27.445 --> 17:29.239
Okay, okay.

17:29.323 --> 17:31.367
[Maya sniffles and sighs]

17:31.450 --> 17:33.869
Okay, first, you just
breathe. Just breathe.

17:36.497 --> 17:41.460
Look, if music is your
dream... I'll support you.

17:41.543 --> 17:42.878
Yesterday you said...

17:42.961 --> 17:47.298
I know what I said, and
you're still very grounded,

17:47.383 --> 17:50.552
but hell if I'm gonna let
people tear you down like that.

17:54.014 --> 17:57.518
[sniffles] So what do
I do? What would you do?

17:59.060 --> 18:02.731
Show them how they
treated you was not okay.

18:06.067 --> 18:07.653
[sniffles]

18:10.906 --> 18:12.491
I'll help you fix this.

18:13.617 --> 18:15.661
We are going so hardcore.

18:15.744 --> 18:18.038
Hunter has us practicing
four nights a week.

18:18.121 --> 18:20.707
My fingers are so sore,
but I honestly think

18:20.791 --> 18:23.502
we have a really good chance
of getting to nationals.

18:23.585 --> 18:25.170
We had our open gaming competition

18:25.253 --> 18:28.006
and Gamer Club's public
exhibition is next week.

18:28.089 --> 18:30.926
- That's nice.
- Think you'll make an appearance?

18:33.344 --> 18:34.471
[sighs]

18:35.806 --> 18:36.848
[softly] Oh, no.

18:36.932 --> 18:38.349
Is everything okay?

18:39.768 --> 18:43.855
Vijay... you're really great, but, um...

18:43.939 --> 18:45.857
I don't think this is gonna work out.

18:47.067 --> 18:48.652
You're breaking up with me?

18:49.695 --> 18:51.697
[stammers] Is there someone else?

18:51.780 --> 18:54.783
No, no, of course not.

18:54.866 --> 18:56.326
I mean...

18:57.411 --> 19:00.163
Well... maybe.

19:02.791 --> 19:05.669
- Oh, God, oh, God, oh, God.
- Look, Vijay, don't cry.

19:05.752 --> 19:07.838
It's... it's not you, it's me.

19:08.422 --> 19:10.381
- You're damn right it's you.
- What?

19:10.466 --> 19:11.717
We are so cute together.

19:11.800 --> 19:14.010
Correction, "were" so cute together, okay?

19:14.094 --> 19:16.763
We could've been Degrassi's
number one power couple,

19:16.847 --> 19:19.558
but instead you're too busy
thinking with your ding-dong!

19:19.641 --> 19:22.519
- Okay, don't yell.
- You don't get to tell me what to do.

19:22.603 --> 19:24.605
You're not breaking up with me!

19:24.688 --> 19:26.106
I'm breaking up with you!

19:26.189 --> 19:28.149
- Vijay, I'm honestly really sorry...
- Too late.

19:28.233 --> 19:30.652
I've already changed
our relationship status.

19:38.284 --> 19:39.703
[indistinct chatter]

19:41.079 --> 19:42.623
Miles is just messing with you.

19:42.706 --> 19:44.708
[Tristan] Yeah, but I'm still not over him.

19:44.791 --> 19:48.294
And I can't lead Vijay on because
I know how much that sucks.

19:48.378 --> 19:50.130
Why does this always happen to me?

19:50.213 --> 19:52.633
Pity party for one, your table's now ready.

19:52.716 --> 19:57.387
[laughs] If Vijay wasn't enough
to get rid of your Miles habit,

19:57.471 --> 19:59.222
one of these boys will.

19:59.305 --> 20:00.306
Yowza.

20:00.390 --> 20:02.768
That guy deserves an ab-salute.

20:02.851 --> 20:03.894
[laughs]

20:03.977 --> 20:05.604
And if that doesn't work?

20:05.687 --> 20:08.524
Nothing wrong with having a
little fun in the meantime.

20:10.316 --> 20:12.318
Shh! They're coming on. [chuckles]

20:12.402 --> 20:14.613
[sniffles and clears throat] Hi, everyone.

20:14.696 --> 20:17.741
I'm Maya Matlin. That's
Grace, and that's Jonah.

20:17.824 --> 20:19.242
Yeah, Grace!

20:19.325 --> 20:21.662
Not everyone gets a second
chance at this place,

20:21.745 --> 20:22.788
so we're lucky that way.

20:22.871 --> 20:25.248
I'll take a second
chance on you, sweetheart.

20:25.331 --> 20:28.585
Did I forget to mention that my
mom's sitting right over there?

20:28.669 --> 20:30.504
Yeah, I'm sure you didn't
mean any harm, but...

20:30.587 --> 20:32.463
catcalls like that are not okay.

20:32.548 --> 20:35.466
Coincidentally, that's
the name of our new song.

What would we even talk about?

21:40.281 --> 21:42.868
I mean, sure, there's the science.

21:42.951 --> 21:45.829
- But you can't date science.
- [Shay] <i>Exactly.</i>

21:47.789 --> 21:50.083
So you're totally over
him? There are zero feels?

21:50.917 --> 21:52.878
[sighs] Well, we're not well-suited.

21:52.961 --> 21:56.297
So you wouldn't be mad if he dated
another girl, like, right away?

21:57.591 --> 22:00.093
- I guess not. <i>
- I'm so glad you feel that way,</i>

22:00.176 --> 22:02.387
'cause... [sighs]

22:04.640 --> 22:06.349
I've been in love with Tiny forever.

22:08.559 --> 22:09.686
You never said anything.

22:09.770 --> 22:11.062
Because you liked him.

22:11.146 --> 22:14.149
<i>- But now that you don't like him...</i>
- You wanna go for him.

22:15.191 --> 22:17.360
He asked me to a movie.

22:17.443 --> 22:19.612
I wanna say yes.

22:20.414 --> 22:21.499
Is that okay?

22:22.532 --> 22:23.909
<i>You can't imagine how hard it is</i>

22:23.992 --> 22:26.703
to see the guy you're
into, into someone else.

22:27.912 --> 22:29.246
Oh, I've got a pretty good idea.

22:29.994 --> 22:31.370
So do I have your blessing?

22:33.960 --> 22:35.378
- [tearfully] Go ahead. <i>
- Thanks, Shay.</i>

22:35.461 --> 22:36.546
You're the best.

22:43.970 --> 22:45.513
That's me...

22:47.598 --> 22:48.809
the best.
