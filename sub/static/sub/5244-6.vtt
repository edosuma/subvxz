"It Comes Back to Haunt Us"
playing

00:05.797 --> 00:09.756
J‘ Each time J‘

00:09.927 --> 00:13.044
J‘ That we J‘

00:16.642 --> 00:21.352
J‘ Give a little bit J‘

00:21.522 --> 00:25.185
J‘ It comes back J‘

00:25.359 --> 00:29.193
J‘ To haunt us... J‘

00:30.280 --> 00:33.989
(vocalizing )

00:55.556 --> 00:58.263
(thudding)

01:14.241 --> 01:19.907
(theme music playing )

01:39.808 --> 01:41.594
-Mom?
- Madison: Go get your stuff.

01:41.768 --> 01:43.474
- What happened?
- We've got to go.

01:43.645 --> 01:45.260
- But... what happened?
- Now, Chris.

01:45.439 --> 01:47.680
- The Guard is pulling out.
- Yeah, we saw them on the street.

01:47.858 --> 01:49.519
- They were looting.
- They're leaving, we're leaving.

01:49.693 --> 01:52.025
I thought this was getting better.
I thought we were winning.

01:52.195 --> 01:54.060
They're retreating.

01:54.239 --> 01:56.571
It's not safe for us to stay.
Each for our own now.

01:56.742 --> 01:58.607
Going back to our original plan.
We're driving east.

01:58.785 --> 01:59.991
Come on.

02:00.162 --> 02:02.073
We've got enough food
and water to last us.

02:02.247 --> 02:04.112
What about Mom?

02:04.291 --> 02:05.906
We're gonna get her and Nick.

02:06.084 --> 02:07.620
Let's go.

02:08.920 --> 02:10.785
- How, Dad?
- What?

02:10.964 --> 02:13.000
How do we get them?

02:16.136 --> 02:19.299
( radio chatter)

02:20.849 --> 02:24.262
I found the place he spoke of
with the dead inside.

02:24.436 --> 02:26.973
It's close to their base.
We can use it.

02:30.525 --> 02:32.231
lthink he has
given us all he can.

02:32.402 --> 02:34.518
- No, we still need him.
- He can escape.

02:34.696 --> 02:36.482
- He can warn the others.
- The soldiers are leaving.

02:36.657 --> 02:38.739
The soldiers are still there.

02:38.909 --> 02:40.991
- They have guards.
- Hey, I said no.

02:41.161 --> 02:42.742
( muffled )
The compound.

02:42.913 --> 02:44.449
You know where
the compound--

02:45.999 --> 02:48.456
You don't know-- you know
where the compound is,

02:48.627 --> 02:50.788
but you don't know where to go
once you're there.

02:50.962 --> 02:53.214
Which building,
what floor, what hall.

02:53.382 --> 02:57.045
You don't know
where your family is inside.

02:57.219 --> 02:59.676
Okay? The place,
it's like a goddamn maze

02:59.846 --> 03:03.213
and I can draw you
a map, all right?

03:03.392 --> 03:05.007
You won't get in without me.

03:05.185 --> 03:07.642
We're bringing him.

03:14.861 --> 03:17.022
He can ride in the truck
with you.

03:17.197 --> 03:18.357
Why?

03:20.909 --> 03:22.365
Ashamed of something?

03:22.536 --> 03:24.197
You afraid the kids will see?

03:24.371 --> 03:25.406
If Chris was in danger,

03:25.580 --> 03:27.787
you'd do anything you could
to protect him,

03:27.958 --> 03:29.494
wouldn't you?

03:42.389 --> 03:44.004
Daniel:
Ofelia.

03:46.893 --> 03:49.179
We're going to go
find your mother,

03:49.354 --> 03:51.891
take her with us.

03:52.065 --> 03:53.396
- I need your help.
- ( zips bag )

03:55.736 --> 03:57.727
What about Andy?

04:00.699 --> 04:02.564
We'll bring him.

04:04.995 --> 04:06.906
You lied to me

04:07.080 --> 04:08.866
my whole life.

04:09.916 --> 04:12.908
l protected you
your whole life.

04:13.086 --> 04:14.951
( zips bag )

04:16.590 --> 04:18.546
Does Mama know?

04:29.269 --> 04:31.760
I thought you were the victim.

04:33.982 --> 04:36.314
Would you rather that be true?

04:38.862 --> 04:40.944
Ofelia.

05:12.562 --> 05:14.268
Alicia, get in the car.

05:23.198 --> 05:25.564
( dog barks )

05:27.994 --> 05:30.485
( dog barks )

05:33.834 --> 05:35.825
Whoa, whoa.

05:36.002 --> 05:38.835
- What?
- My neighbors don't know.

05:39.005 --> 05:40.916
( scoffs )

05:41.091 --> 05:43.377
They did nothing
when they came for us.

05:47.430 --> 05:49.421
Exnen
20 patients left-- 12 critical,

05:49.599 --> 05:51.590
the rest stable,
all infection-free.

05:51.768 --> 05:54.054
One Chinook could lift
the entire ward and personnel

05:54.229 --> 05:55.719
plus two dozen
more soldiers, over.

05:55.897 --> 05:57.888
( static crackling )

05:59.568 --> 06:02.059
Man on radio:
Transport inbound, over.

06:03.405 --> 06:05.862
What's the ETA, over?

06:06.032 --> 06:08.284
Man on radio:
0215,oven

06:09.494 --> 06:11.701
Copy that.
Over and out.

06:11.872 --> 06:14.784
Everybody, Edwards
Air Force Base has room.

06:14.958 --> 06:16.914
Let's lock it down.
Crit cases are gonna be flying.

06:17.085 --> 06:18.586
We're going mobile.

06:18.753 --> 06:21.210
- ( chattering )
- ( woman coughing)

06:23.174 --> 06:24.380
What about my son?

06:24.551 --> 06:26.041
I submitted the request.

06:26.219 --> 06:27.755
I'll follow up.

06:27.929 --> 06:29.214
And the rest of my family?

06:29.389 --> 06:31.095
Who are we counting as family?

06:31.266 --> 06:33.052
We talking blood or bond?

06:34.978 --> 06:36.388
A son needs his father.

06:36.563 --> 06:39.054
True, but the father
will want his girlfriend.

06:39.232 --> 06:41.063
The girlfriend will want
her children.

06:41.234 --> 06:43.350
What is family now?

06:43.528 --> 06:44.859
Be brutal.

06:45.030 --> 06:46.861
l was brutal

06:47.032 --> 06:48.693
and you promised me
Christopher.

06:48.867 --> 06:50.232
Yes.

06:50.410 --> 06:51.775
Just him?

06:54.247 --> 06:56.238
And his father Travis.

07:02.881 --> 07:03.996
You might as well kill me now.

07:04.174 --> 07:05.459
The old man
is gonna do it later.

07:05.634 --> 07:07.295
No, he won't.

07:09.054 --> 07:11.090
You think that's what he did
in El Salvador?

07:11.264 --> 07:12.800
Torture and release?

07:12.974 --> 07:14.589
Get in the truck.

07:14.768 --> 07:16.724
You can't stop him.
Your own wife let him do it.

07:16.895 --> 07:18.260
- She let it happen.
- You took her son.

07:18.438 --> 07:20.269
No, I didn't.
I didn't do shit.

07:20.440 --> 07:22.431
l was kind.
I was kind to his daughter.

07:22.609 --> 07:25.521
He cuts me.
He mutilates me.

07:26.988 --> 07:28.649
Just get us
where we need to go.

07:30.283 --> 07:32.820
I'll tell you
where you need to go.

07:36.706 --> 07:38.321
- I can't do that. Just get in--
- Why? Why?

07:38.500 --> 07:40.365
- Get in the goddamn truck.
- You're not like them.

07:40.543 --> 07:41.623
I can see that
you're not like them.

07:41.795 --> 07:43.035
Get in the truck or I'm gonna
put you in the truck.

07:43.213 --> 07:46.501
The only reason to keep me now
is to kill me and you know it.

07:47.968 --> 07:50.459
Please...

07:50.637 --> 07:52.548
there's no story here
that doesn't end with me dead.

08:53.950 --> 08:55.531
Jesus, they just left.

08:55.702 --> 08:57.283
They abandoned us.

09:06.046 --> 09:08.128
( buzzer blares )

09:44.584 --> 09:46.415
Soldier:
So they're saying Edwards.

09:46.586 --> 09:48.793
- Who's saying Edwards?
- Superiors.

09:50.090 --> 09:51.580
There's no superiors left, man.

09:51.758 --> 09:52.838
There's no one.

09:53.009 --> 09:54.510
( radio chatter)

09:54.677 --> 09:56.838
The hell is this?

09:59.265 --> 10:00.926
Is he turned?

10:01.101 --> 10:02.932
Soldier:
The dead don't use tools, man.

10:03.103 --> 10:04.718
Soldier #2:
Could be infected.

10:04.896 --> 10:06.227
Nice night.

10:06.397 --> 10:08.683
Sir, you're entering
a restricted area.

10:08.858 --> 10:10.598
Stay where you are.

10:10.777 --> 10:12.483
I don't want to have
to shoot you, old man.

10:12.654 --> 10:14.485
You should save
your ammunition.

10:17.659 --> 10:19.775
(snarling )

10:21.955 --> 10:24.446
Soldier:
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

10:25.708 --> 10:28.290
Holy shit!
Multiple infected northwest corner.

10:28.461 --> 10:30.543
(soldiers shouting )

10:36.261 --> 10:38.001
Soldier #2:
Come on.

11:02.370 --> 11:05.658
(alarm blaring )

11:05.832 --> 11:08.164
I led them to the north gate,

11:08.334 --> 11:10.711
so all the soldiers
are distracted.

11:10.879 --> 11:12.915
We can go now.
We should move.

11:13.089 --> 11:15.546
- ( car door closes )
- ( distant shouting, gunfire)

11:20.722 --> 11:22.178
What did you do?

11:22.348 --> 11:25.556
He told me where to find them.

11:25.727 --> 11:28.594
- He told you?
- Yeah. I believed him, okay?

11:28.771 --> 11:30.762
- Like you believed him.
- It was the right thing to do.

11:30.940 --> 11:32.601
You'll see what doing
the right thing gets you.

11:32.775 --> 11:33.855
Chris.

11:34.027 --> 11:38.020
If things go sideways,
if you see anything, you drive.

11:38.198 --> 11:40.905
Take the SUV and you drive
to the campground.

11:41.075 --> 11:42.736
If we're more
than 30 minutes, drive.

11:42.911 --> 11:45.277
Dad, don't leave me here.
I can help.

11:45.455 --> 11:48.322
- I want to. Let me.
- We'll find you, I promise.

11:48.499 --> 11:51.036
I don't drive yet.

11:51.211 --> 11:53.918
Alicia can drive
if it comes to that.

11:54.088 --> 11:56.170
Chris, you're gonna be okay.

11:57.926 --> 11:59.962
Take care of her, okay?

12:00.136 --> 12:01.922
- ( trunk slams)
- Ofelia: Let's go.

12:02.096 --> 12:04.348
( softly )
You take care of him.

12:18.238 --> 12:20.854
-( people chatting )
- ( woman crying)

12:38.758 --> 12:40.498
Don't draw
unnecessary attention.

12:42.720 --> 12:45.427
lam losing my mind.

12:47.558 --> 12:49.970
I thought the house was bad.

12:51.604 --> 12:55.813
Picture you're somewhere else
with a needle in your arm.

13:03.157 --> 13:05.534
Where's your house?

13:05.702 --> 13:08.535
Close.
El Sereno.

13:08.705 --> 13:10.536
Oldest community
in Los Angeles.

13:10.707 --> 13:11.787
Predates the city.

13:11.958 --> 13:15.200
Vibrant, blue-collar, diverse.

13:18.298 --> 13:21.415
l'd gentrify the shit
out of El Sereno.

13:25.138 --> 13:28.630
Another time, another world.

13:28.808 --> 13:31.174
(distant shouting, gunfire)

13:31.352 --> 13:33.764
-( people shouting )
- Nick: What's that?

13:35.315 --> 13:37.180
What's going on?

13:37.358 --> 13:39.770
Full auto, close.

13:39.944 --> 13:43.186
(alarm blaring )

13:43.364 --> 13:46.197
- It's time to go.
- So where are we going?

13:47.535 --> 13:49.366
What's wrong?

14:02.925 --> 14:06.338
-( helicopter blades whirring )
- ( gunfire continues)

14:18.775 --> 14:22.017
- ( distant shouting )
-( infected snarling )

14:23.154 --> 14:24.985
Son of a bitch.

14:25.156 --> 14:26.987
What?

14:28.201 --> 14:31.159
The compound's compromised,
and now evac knows it.

14:37.377 --> 14:39.208
Over here!

14:39.379 --> 14:41.540
Call backup!
Hurry up!

14:41.714 --> 14:44.330
(alarm, shouting continue)

14:48.930 --> 14:50.716
Oh, my God.

14:50.890 --> 14:53.131
Soldier:
Hold the perimeter!

14:53.309 --> 14:54.765
Soldier #2:
We need more men!

14:54.936 --> 14:56.892
Daniel:
The hard part is done.

14:58.231 --> 15:01.018
If the infected get in,
how do we get out?

15:01.192 --> 15:02.978
Daniel:
That would be the harder part.

15:10.743 --> 15:13.405
What is the delay, over?

15:13.579 --> 15:16.571
Man on radio:
Stand by, Doctor. Stand by, over.

15:16.749 --> 15:18.705
The compound is secure.
We're ready to go.

15:18.876 --> 15:21.834
Doctor, we have reports of infected
around your perimeter, over.

15:22.004 --> 15:24.256
They're outside.
The compound is secure.

15:24.424 --> 15:28.087
If you come now,
there's time to extract us, over.

15:28.261 --> 15:30.593
We are assessing, over.

15:30.763 --> 15:32.219
Dr. Exner.

15:37.145 --> 15:38.681
Go.

15:39.939 --> 15:42.021
Everyone go.
The transports are downstairs.

15:42.191 --> 15:44.147
- Aren't they coming?
- No.

15:44.318 --> 15:46.400
Nurse:
What about our patients?

15:46.571 --> 15:49.358
I'll take care of them.
Just go.

15:50.491 --> 15:52.231
What about Chris?

15:52.410 --> 15:55.618
If they haven't gone for him
by now, they never will.

15:55.788 --> 15:57.198
I'm sorry.

16:10.720 --> 16:12.551
Go, Liza.
Run.

16:20.646 --> 16:22.807
Man on radio:
Stand by, Doctor, over.

16:42.627 --> 16:44.458
Chﬁs:
This is crazy.

16:49.967 --> 16:51.252
They'll come back.

16:58.893 --> 17:01.930
If they can't get in,
they'll come back.

17:05.608 --> 17:07.314
And leave the others?

17:08.694 --> 17:09.945
Would you rather they all died?

17:10.112 --> 17:12.103
I don't want anyone to die.

17:12.281 --> 17:14.488
I don't want that.

17:14.659 --> 17:15.865
You sound like your dad.

17:16.035 --> 17:18.572
Yeah, well, he tries.

17:18.746 --> 17:22.204
-( loud thumping)
- ( snarling)

17:30.424 --> 17:33.291
You can't save everyone.

17:33.469 --> 17:35.881
- Why the hell would you say that?
- Because you can't.

17:37.515 --> 17:39.176
Sorry, it's just-- it's the truth.

17:39.350 --> 17:41.215
- Shut up.
- What?

17:43.312 --> 17:44.768
Get in the car.
Get in the car.

17:51.862 --> 17:53.477
( people shouting )

17:53.656 --> 17:55.146
Come along.
Come along.

17:56.826 --> 17:58.111
Woman:
Let us out of here!

17:58.286 --> 17:59.696
The key is not one size fits all.

17:59.870 --> 18:01.201
We'll die in here!

18:01.372 --> 18:02.987
My friend, you're more
likely to die out there.

18:03.165 --> 18:04.291
Hey, you're not gonna help them?

18:04.458 --> 18:05.743
- We're not gonna help them.
- Why?

18:05.918 --> 18:08.580
Because helping them
could hurt us.

18:10.506 --> 18:13.748
- Don't leave us here.
- Strand: There's no value add.

18:13.926 --> 18:15.382
Seriously?

18:15.553 --> 18:18.340
Save yourself, Nick.
Let others drop behind.

18:18.514 --> 18:20.220
Seriously.

18:20.391 --> 18:22.347
- So where are we going?
- We need a ride.

18:22.518 --> 18:24.383
- And then?
- Abigail.

18:24.562 --> 18:25.893
Who the hell's Abigail?

18:26.063 --> 18:27.519
( people shouting )

18:29.609 --> 18:32.021
If they're dead,
they'll just keep walking, right?

18:32.194 --> 18:34.571
- They'll walk away?
- I don't know.

18:49.211 --> 18:52.624
- ( door handles click)
-(gaspS)

18:54.550 --> 18:56.006
(Alicia shrieks )

18:56.177 --> 18:57.462
- Chris: Hey!
- Come on.

18:57.637 --> 19:00.595
- Shut your-- come on.
- Hey!

19:00.765 --> 19:04.383
- Get off me!
- Get out. Come on.

19:04.560 --> 19:06.016
Alicia:
Get off me.

19:12.068 --> 19:14.275
Why didn't you guys just open
the damn door, huh?

19:14.445 --> 19:15.855
What do you guys want?

19:16.030 --> 19:19.318
Transport.
Son, just give us the keys.

19:19.492 --> 19:21.357
- No.
- ( soldier chuckles)

19:21.535 --> 19:24.151
Come on, man,
we'll take you with us.

19:24.330 --> 19:26.036
We're not going anywhere.

19:26.207 --> 19:28.038
Suit yourself.

19:28.209 --> 19:30.825
- What about you, girl?
- Hey, you leave her alone. Leave her--

19:32.797 --> 19:35.254
Stop it! Stop it!
l have the keys.

19:43.015 --> 19:45.677
- You sure you don't want to come--
- Hey, don't touch her, man!

19:45.851 --> 19:47.842
Get off me!

20:00.741 --> 20:03.733
- ( radio chatter)
- ( alarm blaring )

20:05.329 --> 20:07.615
( distant gunfire )

20:11.127 --> 20:13.413
This must be the checkpoint.

20:13.587 --> 20:16.420
Adams said there'd be a sign
marked administration.

20:16.590 --> 20:18.330
It's here.

20:24.056 --> 20:26.047
- ( shouting )
-( infected snarling )

20:33.482 --> 20:34.983

20:40.906 --> 20:43.898
- ( soldiers shouting )

20:45.786 --> 20:47.242

(shouting continues)

20:50.207 --> 20:52.539
( infected snarling )

20:54.837 --> 20:56.998
(snarling )

20:57.173 --> 20:59.129
Soldier:
We can't hold 'em!

21:01.010 --> 21:02.591
The gate isn't gonna hold!

21:02.762 --> 21:04.798
There's too many of them.
I'm out of here.

21:04.972 --> 21:06.553
They're breaking through.

21:08.559 --> 21:10.971
Let's go.
I got you.

21:11.145 --> 21:13.352
Give me your hand, ma'am.

21:14.940 --> 21:17.272
- Come on, it's now or never.
- No.

21:22.573 --> 21:24.484
(soldier screaming )

21:35.336 --> 21:36.997
Pilot:
Come on, we're going!

21:39.215 --> 21:41.376
- Oh, God.
- Nah, he's infected.

21:41.550 --> 21:43.711
Just leave him.
Let's go, let's go!

21:47.556 --> 21:48.636
Ah!

21:48.808 --> 21:52.426

Colonel!

22:03.906 --> 22:05.817
Ah, no!

22:07.159 --> 22:08.820
(soldiers shouting )

22:08.994 --> 22:11.986
- Run!
- Soldier: No, no!

22:12.164 --> 22:14.621
No!
(screaming )

22:17.211 --> 22:20.829

22:30.808 --> 22:32.423

Which way?

22:54.039 --> 22:55.245
( beeps, locks )

23:06.802 --> 23:09.509
-( infected snarling )
- ( soldier grunting )

23:09.680 --> 23:11.466
Shit.

23:11.640 --> 23:13.426
Shh.

23:18.564 --> 23:19.895
Wait here.

23:20.065 --> 23:22.147
Are you crazy, man?
What are you doing?

23:22.318 --> 23:24.400
It's all right.
They're slow.

23:28.032 --> 23:29.772
(soldier groans)

23:29.950 --> 23:31.861
All right, Melvin.

23:36.540 --> 23:38.952
(snarling )

23:39.126 --> 23:42.414
(soldier groaning )

23:45.341 --> 23:48.048
Soldier:
Help me.

23:48.218 --> 23:50.083

Strand.
Stran--

23:55.768 --> 23:58.350
Strand.
Str--

24:05.611 --> 24:06.646
Keep the watch.

24:06.820 --> 24:10.779
Please, kill me.

24:12.576 --> 24:13.861
You're well on your way.

24:14.036 --> 24:16.402
- Nick: Strand.
-( infected growling )

24:20.459 --> 24:21.744
Nick:
How do we get out of here now?

24:21.919 --> 24:25.082
Fantastic question.
Melvin was my ride.

24:28.008 --> 24:30.249
( people shouting )

24:32.137 --> 24:34.048
Jesus.

24:39.144 --> 24:41.476
Nick.

24:41.647 --> 24:42.932
- Nick!
- Daniel: Griselda!

24:43.107 --> 24:44.938
- Mama!
- Man: Help us!

24:45.109 --> 24:46.349

24:46.527 --> 24:47.516

- Nick!

24:47.695 --> 24:48.775
- Help us, please.

24:48.946 --> 24:51.107
- Mama!
- Who are you looking for?

24:51.281 --> 24:52.942
I'm looking for my son.
He's 19.

24:53.117 --> 24:54.482
- There was a boy with the suit.
- Who?

24:54.660 --> 24:56.025
Rich guy stuck
in here with us.

24:56.203 --> 24:58.159
- Where'd they go?
- We'll tell you. Let us out.

24:58.330 --> 24:59.490
Yeah.

25:02.251 --> 25:03.741
Travis.

25:09.341 --> 25:10.330
Whoa, whoa, wait.
Where, where?

25:10.509 --> 25:12.340
- Strand took him out the back.
- Keep moving!

25:12.511 --> 25:14.342

Go, go.

( panting )

25:29.820 --> 25:32.937
(grunting)

25:36.076 --> 25:37.737
That's unfortunate.

25:46.045 --> 25:48.036
Let's get out of here!

25:48.213 --> 25:50.169
Oh, go, go, go!

25:50.340 --> 25:52.376
- ( woman screaming )

25:52.551 --> 25:54.382
Woman #2:

- Mom!

26:18.077 --> 26:19.408
- Open it, Travis.
- I'm trying.

26:19.578 --> 26:22.991
We'll get you out.
Nick, no.

26:24.625 --> 26:27.116
Look out, they're coming.
No!

26:27.294 --> 26:30.286
- No! No!
- Mom.

26:30.464 --> 26:31.670
Go.

-( lock beeps )
- Hurry!

26:38.597 --> 26:40.133

- Save us!

26:40.307 --> 26:42.298
- Madison: Hurry, they're coming!
- Liza: It's not working!

26:42.476 --> 26:44.182
- Madison: Come on!
- Come on, please.

26:44.353 --> 26:46.389
Come on!
Move!

26:46.563 --> 26:48.554
- Madison: Hurry!
- Now, open it!

26:48.732 --> 26:49.812
Go!

26:49.983 --> 26:52.144

26:57.741 --> 26:59.572
Look out.

27:00.953 --> 27:02.944
Hush up.

27:09.753 --> 27:11.618
(grill hissing)

27:23.517 --> 27:26.054
- ( growling)
- ( shouting)

27:27.980 --> 27:29.345
Papa?

27:29.523 --> 27:30.763
( gunshots)

27:34.153 --> 27:35.609
(shouting )

27:36.697 --> 27:37.686
Hey!

27:52.754 --> 27:54.836
( screams )

27:58.051 --> 27:59.382
No!

27:59.553 --> 28:02.215
No. Help!

28:04.850 --> 28:06.056
Oh, my God.

28:07.394 --> 28:09.476
Come on, you guys.
Let's go. Run.

28:12.733 --> 28:14.314
- Liza: Where's Chris?
- Travis: He's safe.

28:14.484 --> 28:16.395
- Where?
- Outside the compound with Alicia.

28:16.570 --> 28:17.935
We got to find
another way out of here now.

28:18.113 --> 28:19.193
Get back
to the medical ward.

28:19.364 --> 28:21.195
We get back there,
Exner will know.

28:25.621 --> 28:27.953
- Who the hell are you?
- This is Strand.

28:28.123 --> 28:29.533
He saved my life.

28:41.511 --> 28:45.003
Liza, where is my wife?

28:52.064 --> 28:53.679
I'm sorry, Daniel.

28:58.195 --> 28:59.935
Where is she?

29:01.740 --> 29:03.355
Tell me.

29:03.533 --> 29:05.660
The infection took her.

29:05.827 --> 29:08.785
Everything that could be done was.
It was just too late.

29:08.956 --> 29:10.537
Where?
I want to see her.

29:10.707 --> 29:13.995
- Ofelia.
- No, Papa, no. Papa, no, no--

29:14.169 --> 29:15.830
- We must go.
- I want to see my mother.

29:18.215 --> 29:19.955
There's nothing left to see.

29:20.133 --> 29:22.340
I'm sorry.

30:04.303 --> 30:07.045
(gun hissing)

30:14.980 --> 30:16.470
(pills rattling)

30:19.693 --> 30:20.682
Oh.

30:20.861 --> 30:22.601
Doctor...

30:25.407 --> 30:27.443
we need a way out.

30:28.702 --> 30:30.658
You should have gone
when I said.

30:30.829 --> 30:32.820
Travis:
Help us.

30:32.998 --> 30:35.489
I'll take you with my family,
but we need your help.

30:37.210 --> 30:39.166
Where do you think
your family's gonna go?

30:39.338 --> 30:41.249
There has to be somewhere.

30:44.343 --> 30:46.459
There is a way out.

30:46.636 --> 30:49.218
Past the ICU,
the set of stairs down.

30:49.389 --> 30:51.505
Takes you through the sublevel.

30:51.683 --> 30:53.799
You can get out.

30:53.977 --> 30:56.218
But there's nowhere to go.

30:58.065 --> 30:59.680
I'm sorry.

31:00.776 --> 31:01.982
Okay.

31:03.278 --> 31:04.484
Come with us.

31:07.824 --> 31:09.906
There are people
you can still help.

31:10.077 --> 31:11.942
Liza.

31:12.120 --> 31:13.826
We have to go.

31:17.459 --> 31:19.450
She's lost.
Come on.

31:37.896 --> 31:38.931
Strand:
So, what's the master plan?

31:39.106 --> 31:40.266
- I assume one exists?
- What do you mean?

31:40.440 --> 31:42.101
Have you settled on a destination,
an end point?

31:42.275 --> 31:44.527
We're heading east.
The desert.

31:44.694 --> 31:47.231
- Should be safe there.
- It's not.

31:47.406 --> 31:50.148
Then what do you suggest,
Mr. Strand?

31:50.325 --> 31:51.735
Go west.

31:51.910 --> 31:53.366
What's west?

31:53.537 --> 31:55.573
l have a home on the water.

31:55.747 --> 31:57.612
l have supplies.
I'm prepared.

32:02.796 --> 32:05.208
( embers crackling )

32:58.143 --> 33:00.134
(crying)

33:20.207 --> 33:21.822
Travis:
Chris?

33:22.000 --> 33:24.036
Alicia?

33:27.547 --> 33:29.879
- Where's the car?
- Ofelia: Did they leave?

33:30.050 --> 33:31.665
- Travis: Oh, no. Chris!
- Alicia!

33:31.843 --> 33:33.674
- Shh, lower your voice.
- We got to find them.

33:33.845 --> 33:36.678
The dead will hear you
and they will come.

33:36.848 --> 33:37.928
Liza:
Chris!

33:38.099 --> 33:40.260
- Alicia: We're here. Mom!
- Chris: Dad. Dad.

33:40.435 --> 33:42.676
- Are you okay?
- What happened?

33:42.854 --> 33:44.230
The soldiers,
they took the SUV.

33:44.397 --> 33:47.059
- I'm sorry.
- Christopher. Oh, my God.

33:47.234 --> 33:48.565
- Chris: I tried, Dad.
- Liza: What happened to you?

33:48.735 --> 33:50.191
- Oh, my God.
- I'm fine.

33:50.362 --> 33:53.479
- Madison: ...A|icia.
- I'm okay. Mom, Mom, I'm fine.

33:55.283 --> 33:56.534
We must go now.

34:00.664 --> 34:03.201
- Salazar.
- ( gun cocks )

34:11.049 --> 34:12.664
Ofelia:
Andy?

34:14.261 --> 34:16.047
Andy?

34:17.347 --> 34:18.712
- Hey.
- Daniel: Ofelia.

34:18.890 --> 34:20.346
Andrew.

34:20.517 --> 34:22.007
Put the gun down.

34:22.185 --> 34:24.096
You don't have
to do this, okay?

34:24.271 --> 34:26.353
What are you doing?
Just put the gun down.

34:28.275 --> 34:30.140
Andrew, don't do this.

34:30.318 --> 34:31.774
Please, please, please.

34:33.572 --> 34:35.528
- Andy.
- No!

34:35.699 --> 34:37.485
- ( gunshot)
- ( grunts)

34:39.077 --> 34:40.283
Dad!

34:42.205 --> 34:44.196
You're okay.
It's okay. Let me see.

34:44.374 --> 34:46.740
(grunting)

34:55.510 --> 34:57.250
( Travis shouts )

34:57.429 --> 35:00.842
Trav. Leave him, Trav.
Leave him.

35:01.016 --> 35:02.756
(coughing)

35:02.934 --> 35:04.674
Leave him.

35:14.863 --> 35:17.195
- ( panting )
- It's okay.

35:42.641 --> 35:46.179
"World Undone" playing

35:46.353 --> 35:49.015
J‘ Friend, things end J‘

35:52.150 --> 35:54.983
J‘ Waiting for the tears
to come... J‘

35:56.905 --> 35:59.738
( infected growling )

35:59.908 --> 36:02.695
We can't travel through downtown.
There'll be too many.

36:02.869 --> 36:04.370
The 110?

36:04.537 --> 36:06.789
Nah, the freeway's a crapshoot
on the best of days.

36:06.956 --> 36:08.662
I wouldn't risk it.

36:09.834 --> 36:11.620
Do you want to go back?

36:12.837 --> 36:15.544
(chuckles)
You're funny.

36:15.715 --> 36:18.752
We're gonna get along fine,
Nick's mom.

36:23.765 --> 36:26.177
Take a left here.
We can follow the river down to the sea.

36:27.727 --> 36:30.514
J‘ Can't trust in this anymore J‘

36:30.689 --> 36:33.180
J‘ Still waiting on the fence J‘

36:33.358 --> 36:36.020
J‘ So many times before J‘

36:36.194 --> 36:38.936
J‘ What keeps you here
anymore? J‘

36:39.114 --> 36:42.447
( vocalizes )

36:47.580 --> 36:50.708
J‘ Now your world's
coming undone J‘

36:50.875 --> 36:53.537
J‘ World's coming undone... J‘

37:18.319 --> 37:20.025
(snarling )

37:53.813 --> 37:55.314
Come.

37:58.860 --> 38:00.396
( beeps )

38:00.570 --> 38:01.650
Grid's dead.

38:01.821 --> 38:04.563
Generators kick on
when the power dies.

38:35.688 --> 38:37.189
Anyone hungry?

38:37.357 --> 38:39.188
Help yourself.

39:22.277 --> 39:24.188
I'm sorry.

39:26.030 --> 39:27.645
For what?

39:29.367 --> 39:31.358
I let them take you.

39:32.912 --> 39:34.197
(sighs)

39:34.372 --> 39:36.408
Mom.

39:40.712 --> 39:42.794
What?

39:42.964 --> 39:46.001
I don't know.
I don't know.

39:46.175 --> 39:48.006
| feel strange.

39:50.054 --> 39:52.261
Yeah, we're spinning
off the planet.

39:53.641 --> 39:56.053
We don't know
where we're going.

39:56.227 --> 39:57.763
That's the thing.

39:59.981 --> 40:01.937
I never knew
where l was going.

40:05.194 --> 40:09.528
It's like I've been living this
for a long time.

40:12.452 --> 40:17.446
And now everyone
is catching up with me.

40:23.588 --> 40:25.203
Strange.

40:39.312 --> 40:42.179
lt's through and through, Daniel.
It's clotting.

40:45.026 --> 40:47.108
Change the dressing,
keep it clean.

40:47.278 --> 40:49.485
- Mm-hmm.
- She can survive this.

40:50.615 --> 40:53.106
- Gracias.
- Claro.

41:06.631 --> 41:08.997
Hey.
How is she?

41:09.175 --> 41:11.757
She's gonna be okay.

41:11.928 --> 41:13.213
We made it.

41:23.815 --> 41:25.931
I love you, Christopher.

41:41.457 --> 41:43.618
( door opens)

41:43.793 --> 41:46.535
(seagulls screeching )

42:02.020 --> 42:03.806
Where are you going?

42:04.981 --> 42:07.142
I must stay
in constant motion.

42:08.693 --> 42:10.684
What do we do?
Can we stay here?

42:15.199 --> 42:16.735
No.

42:18.619 --> 42:20.234
No, you cannot.

42:21.706 --> 42:23.537
No one stays.

42:39.474 --> 42:41.931
( bag zips )

42:43.102 --> 42:44.558
Where's Abigail?

42:46.522 --> 42:48.228
Not here.

42:48.399 --> 42:50.560
So why are we here?

42:52.653 --> 42:54.644
Why'd we come here
if we're not staying?

42:54.822 --> 42:57.404
(door slides open )

42:57.575 --> 43:00.112
Are you insane?

43:00.286 --> 43:01.787
Strand.

43:02.914 --> 43:05.405
The only way
to survive a mad world

43:05.583 --> 43:07.539
is to embrace the madness.

43:12.590 --> 43:14.296
Is that a yes?

43:36.614 --> 43:38.354
Strand:
Abigail.

43:54.757 --> 43:55.792
Liza.

43:58.594 --> 44:00.585
Liza.
What's wrong?

44:16.404 --> 44:18.440
Oh, God.

44:21.909 --> 44:23.524
Yeah.

44:23.703 --> 44:25.489
Didn't notice till we were clear.

44:26.873 --> 44:29.615
What do we-- what do we do?

44:31.210 --> 44:32.450
There's nothing.

44:38.801 --> 44:40.962
No. No.

44:41.137 --> 44:42.593
No.

44:44.765 --> 44:46.926
I don't think I can do it.

44:47.101 --> 44:50.309
l have to,
but I don't think I can.

44:54.609 --> 44:56.395
No, don't ask me, Liza.
You can't.

44:56.569 --> 44:58.434
You asked me.

44:58.613 --> 44:59.819
Come on.

44:59.989 --> 45:01.854
You never liked me that much.

45:03.868 --> 45:06.075
Don't make Travis do it.

45:06.245 --> 45:07.781
lt'll break him.

45:10.833 --> 45:13.210
- We don't know--
- I know.

45:31.729 --> 45:34.345
What's going on?
Maddy.

45:39.612 --> 45:41.523
Maddy?

45:42.740 --> 45:44.276
She was bitten.

45:45.326 --> 45:46.406
What?

45:46.577 --> 45:48.113
She's infected.

45:52.458 --> 45:55.120
That's-- that's okay.

45:55.294 --> 45:57.410
- That's okay. We have meds now.
- No.

45:57.588 --> 45:59.203
Yeah, you got the antibiotics
from the base, right?

45:59.382 --> 46:01.122
- They don't work.
- We can treat you.

46:01.300 --> 46:03.086
- We could treat it.
- You can't.

46:04.345 --> 46:06.176
Please, Travis.

46:08.641 --> 46:10.597
- Tell Chris I did it.
- No, God damn it.

46:10.768 --> 46:12.804
I'm not gonna-- you're not doing it.
You're not doing anything.

46:12.979 --> 46:15.095
I'm not gonna let you do it, Liza.
Listen.

46:15.273 --> 46:17.138
I've seen it.

46:17.316 --> 46:19.728
I've seen what it does.

46:19.902 --> 46:23.690
The bites don't turn you,
but the infection's not treatable.

46:25.658 --> 46:29.116
The infection kills you
like anything else.

46:29.287 --> 46:31.073
Then it happens.

46:32.665 --> 46:34.747
It doesn't matter how you die,

46:34.917 --> 46:36.999
you come back.

46:37.169 --> 46:39.455
We all come back.

46:41.048 --> 46:43.039
Don't let that happen to me.

46:44.802 --> 46:47.259
Don't let our son see that, okay?

46:49.390 --> 46:51.255
You've got to protect him
from this.

46:51.434 --> 46:53.720
Okay?
Promise me.

46:55.104 --> 46:56.844
Promise.

47:02.695 --> 47:04.151
Okay?

47:05.156 --> 47:08.614
l'll protect him.
I'll protect him.

47:28.346 --> 47:30.428
( Liza crying )

47:46.322 --> 47:48.938
( gunshot echoes)

47:54.288 --> 47:56.529
"Kettering" playing

48:03.756 --> 48:06.372
J‘ | wish that I had known J‘

48:06.550 --> 48:10.134
J‘ In that first minute we met J‘

48:10.304 --> 48:13.296
J‘ The unpayable debt J‘

48:13.474 --> 48:16.716
J‘ That I owed you J‘

48:16.894 --> 48:20.478
J‘ You said you hated my tone J‘

48:20.648 --> 48:23.811
J‘ It made you feel so alone J‘

48:23.984 --> 48:29.854
J‘ And so you told me
I ought to be leaving J‘

48:31.450 --> 48:34.283
J‘ But something
kept me standing J‘

48:34.453 --> 48:37.411
J‘ By that hospital bed J‘

48:37.581 --> 48:40.539
J‘ I should have quit,
but instead J‘

48:40.709 --> 48:44.042
J‘ I took care of you J‘

48:44.213 --> 48:48.001
J‘ You made me sleep
and uneven J‘

48:48.175 --> 48:51.463
J‘ And I didn't believe them J‘

48:51.637 --> 48:57.177
J‘ When they told me
that there was no saving you. J‘

49:33.387 --> 49:36.550
(vocalizing )

50:20.100 --> 50:23.263
(seagulls screeching )

50:37.868 --> 50:40.450
(music playing )

50:46.669 --> 50:50.082
(seagulls screeching )
