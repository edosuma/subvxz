00:45.560 --> 00:46.400
Samuel.

00:48.080 --> 00:49.880
I have to ask you some questions.

00:51.640 --> 00:54.080
<i>You haven't been</i>
<i>at this school for long, right?</i>

00:54.160 --> 00:56.600
RECONSTRUCTION OF:
SAN ESTEBAN HIGH SCHOOL

00:56.680 --> 01:00.800
<i>No, almost four months.</i>
<i>I used to attend San Esteban.</i>

01:01.400 --> 01:02.240
SWINDLERS

01:02.640 --> 01:05.120
<i>San Esteban, the school that collapsed?</i>

01:12.840 --> 01:13.680
Calm down.

01:15.120 --> 01:16.400
It's going to be all right.

02:39.800 --> 02:41.840
Another woman's after your husband.

02:41.920 --> 02:43.960
Have you noticed anything off lately?

02:44.640 --> 02:45.640
What are you doing?

02:45.720 --> 02:47.720
It's hers. I was just holding it for her.

02:47.800 --> 02:49.120
This kid, I'm telling you.

02:56.640 --> 02:57.760
<i>To win over the locals,</i>

02:57.840 --> 03:00.320
<i>the construction company</i>
<i>funded three scholarships...</i>

03:01.760 --> 03:03.560
<i>to study here at Las Encinas.</i>

03:06.480 --> 03:08.160
I was one of the lucky ones.

03:24.320 --> 03:25.280
Samu!

03:26.120 --> 03:27.960
-What's up, man?
-How are you?

03:29.760 --> 03:30.600
Hello, beautiful.

03:30.680 --> 03:33.840
Shit, sorry. You won't blow yourself up
because I said that, right?

03:37.440 --> 03:38.680
Do you know each other?

03:38.760 --> 03:40.240
He's a buddy of my brother's.

03:40.320 --> 03:42.400
This is fucking paradise, man.

03:43.400 --> 03:44.400
Can't you smell it?

03:44.920 --> 03:47.240
Those chicks pee cologne, dude.
I'm telling you.

03:48.840 --> 03:50.440
Let's take a walk around, OK?

03:58.800 --> 04:01.480
Shit.
They're looking at us like we're Martians.

04:01.920 --> 04:03.160
You get used to it.

04:04.040 --> 04:07.120
Come on, how about a photo?
A selfie or something.

04:09.320 --> 04:10.640
Let's take a look around.

04:12.080 --> 04:13.720
You know you can't use your phone?

04:13.800 --> 04:16.440
If they catch you,
they'll confiscate it for a week.

04:16.520 --> 04:18.400
That's against the Constitution.

04:18.480 --> 04:22.480
-You've read the Constitution?
-No. I'm waiting for the movie.

04:23.000 --> 04:25.760
-It's in the handbook.
-You've read the handbook?

04:29.480 --> 04:31.120
When your name is Nadia Shanaa,

04:31.200 --> 04:33.680
you'd better know
what can get you expelled.

04:34.080 --> 04:35.040
Just in case.

04:41.120 --> 04:43.640
The swimming pool
is bigger than the school!

04:44.120 --> 04:45.760
You like to swim, right?

05:18.840 --> 05:20.280
<i>You were in the same class.</i>

05:24.000 --> 05:24.840
Samuel.

05:25.520 --> 05:30.240
You'd be saving us a lot of time and work
if you answered a simple question.

05:32.040 --> 05:33.720
Why did you have blood on you?

05:42.480 --> 05:44.800
I've done nothing.
I want a lawyer, please.

05:46.920 --> 05:48.520
What else isn't allowed?

05:48.600 --> 05:51.640
Drinking, smoking on the grounds,
doing drugs.

05:51.760 --> 05:53.440
So, they don't allow anything cool.

05:53.520 --> 05:55.680
-Depends on what you think is cool.
-Olé!

05:55.760 --> 05:58.240
Hey!

05:59.160 --> 06:00.720
What the fuck, man?

06:01.080 --> 06:01.920
Sorry!

06:04.640 --> 06:05.600
Don't cry!

06:05.680 --> 06:06.840
This is your classroom.

06:06.920 --> 06:10.440
Wait for your teacher,
and after class, I'll assign you lockers.

06:10.560 --> 06:11.760
-Welcome!
-Cool.

06:12.280 --> 06:14.120
-Are you the new kids?
-Yes.

06:14.600 --> 06:16.920
Good luck, then. You're gonna need it.

06:20.760 --> 06:23.160
What's up, guys? I'm Christian.

06:23.240 --> 06:24.240
Look at this guy.

06:24.320 --> 06:25.320
Hi there.

06:25.400 --> 06:26.400
Hello.

06:27.200 --> 06:28.920
-Not there!
-Is it taken?

06:29.360 --> 06:32.640
-By my invisible friend.
-Oh. Enjoy his company.

06:33.520 --> 06:37.520
Good morning, class. How is everybody
doing today? Please sit down.

06:39.400 --> 06:44.680
Okay. So, as we all know, we have
three new students with us today.

06:44.760 --> 06:46.000
Let's meet them.

06:46.560 --> 06:48.240
Damn. Wasn't this a tutorial class?

06:48.320 --> 06:51.320
In English. It's a bilingual school.
You knew that, right?

06:52.120 --> 06:53.080
Christian Varela.

06:53.720 --> 06:54.560
Yes?

06:55.840 --> 06:58.040
Do you want to introduce yourself
to the class?

06:59.400 --> 07:00.600
What's he saying?

07:00.680 --> 07:01.600
Introduce yourself.

07:02.040 --> 07:04.520
Yes. Hello.

07:07.640 --> 07:08.480
Goodbye?

07:12.600 --> 07:13.560
Okay...

07:14.320 --> 07:15.160
Great.

07:16.160 --> 07:17.480
Thank you, Mr. Teacher.

07:18.160 --> 07:19.240
"Mr. Teacher."

07:19.560 --> 07:20.520
Nadia Shanaa.

07:23.040 --> 07:25.320
Hello. I'm Nadia. I'm 16.

07:25.840 --> 07:27.440
My family is from Palestine,

07:27.960 --> 07:29.480
but I was born here in Spain.

07:30.080 --> 07:32.080
And when I finish my studies,

07:32.160 --> 07:35.400
I'd like to be professional diplomat
in the United Nations.

07:35.920 --> 07:37.880
Wow. Impressive.

07:39.320 --> 07:42.160
You know, every year we choose
our best student, and...

07:42.560 --> 07:44.360
the trophy is rather ugly,

07:44.720 --> 07:46.880
but it allows you
to study the next year at...

07:46.960 --> 07:48.240
Who can tell me where?

07:49.320 --> 07:50.160
Carla.

07:51.280 --> 07:52.760
At a school in Florida.

07:52.960 --> 07:55.320
Which gives you access
to an Ivy League university.

07:55.960 --> 07:56.920
How can you win?

07:57.000 --> 08:00.080
Excelling in all activities,
both curricular and extracurricular.

08:00.160 --> 08:03.360
The more extracurriculars, the better.
Photography, chess, Chinese...

08:03.760 --> 08:04.960
Check out the list.

08:05.120 --> 08:07.040
If I were you, I'd watch out for her.

08:07.240 --> 08:08.640
She'll take no prisoners.

08:10.000 --> 08:10.920
Ridiculous.

08:11.240 --> 08:12.880
Wasn't this a secular school?

08:13.200 --> 08:14.800
Samuel García.

08:18.560 --> 08:20.000
Hi. My name is Samuel.

08:20.720 --> 08:23.520
I've got the feeling anything I say
will be used against me,

08:23.600 --> 08:26.320
-so I'll remain silent.
-How darling!

08:26.400 --> 08:29.640
Don't be afraid.
At this school, we teach values.

08:30.160 --> 08:32.280
Manners and respect are paramount.

08:32.640 --> 08:34.640
The leaders of tomorrow are
at this school.

08:35.000 --> 08:37.920
-I know. That's what I'm afraid of.
-What did the waiter say?

08:38.880 --> 08:40.000
He's talking to us.

08:41.160 --> 08:43.120
-Guys.
-Sorry.

08:43.760 --> 08:47.520
All right. My name's Samuel, and I am,
as your classmate said, a waiter.

08:47.640 --> 08:51.120
Strange as it may seem to you,
sometimes waiters get a seat at the table.

08:51.640 --> 08:54.680
But you don't need to worry.
I'm not here to take anybody's place.

08:55.400 --> 08:57.440
You are still the leaders of tomorrow.

08:57.920 --> 08:59.720
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

08:59.800 --> 09:03.120
So, let me continue
with where we left yesterday...

09:21.120 --> 09:24.080
Of all the people there,
you had to mess with my brother.

09:25.000 --> 09:26.360
That was your brother?

09:26.840 --> 09:29.320
And they say the rich don't suffer.

09:29.440 --> 09:30.280
I see.

09:30.960 --> 09:32.760
-My condolences.
-Thank you.

09:33.280 --> 09:34.120
Shall we?

09:35.440 --> 09:39.400
Hey... in case nobody's told you,
it's cool having you in class.

09:40.400 --> 09:41.240
Thanks.

09:43.160 --> 09:44.000
Hello.

09:45.240 --> 09:47.080
Where to? We'll go with you.

09:47.160 --> 09:49.000
-Stop being a dick.
-Watch that mouth.

09:49.080 --> 09:52.440
We're only trying to be friendly.
What's the matter, waiter?

09:52.560 --> 09:53.880
Do you like my sister?

09:53.960 --> 09:57.120
-She's a fan of lost causes...
-Guzmán, go to hell.

09:57.520 --> 09:59.040
Seriously, leave him alone.

09:59.160 --> 10:01.560
Let us have him for a bit.
We want to get to know him.

10:02.120 --> 10:03.480
Or are you afraid of us?

10:03.800 --> 10:05.800
-He is afraid of us!
-He is, yeah.

10:08.240 --> 10:10.920
Waiter... hands off my sister.

10:11.480 --> 10:13.560
Pretend you have a restraining order.

10:13.920 --> 10:16.280
Guzmán... take this.

10:33.920 --> 10:34.760
Nadia.

10:35.240 --> 10:38.080
Can you come with me for a moment?
The principal wants a word.

10:51.440 --> 10:53.960
No one had mentioned the scarf.

10:54.800 --> 10:55.680
Why now?

10:56.440 --> 10:59.400
Per our rules, no accessories are allowed.

11:00.000 --> 11:01.720
My hijab is no accessory.

11:02.360 --> 11:04.560
Besides, everybody has things around here.

11:04.640 --> 11:06.640
Expensive bags, gold watches.

11:06.720 --> 11:09.360
Those are ornamental.
They don't mean anything.

11:09.440 --> 11:11.440
They do. They mean many things.

11:11.800 --> 11:15.880
They mean "I have more money,
more style. I'm better than you."

11:15.960 --> 11:17.960
Nadia, we understand, but--

11:18.040 --> 11:19.840
Look, if you understood...

11:21.280 --> 11:23.680
you wouldn't ask me to give up
my culture or religion.

11:23.760 --> 11:25.760
Nadia, think about it.

11:26.960 --> 11:28.080
It's up to you.

11:28.600 --> 11:30.200
But if you wear it tomorrow...

11:30.800 --> 11:32.960
we'll have no choice but to expel you.

11:40.120 --> 11:42.240
Who do you think calls the shots here?

11:50.320 --> 11:52.640
Don't you have other things
to worry about?

11:53.360 --> 11:55.520
Like the fact that you speak no English.

11:55.760 --> 11:58.800
Come on, it's not nothing,
it's "a little butt."

11:58.880 --> 12:00.200
I got it all under control.

12:00.280 --> 12:02.000
Lend me your notes in English,

12:02.080 --> 12:04.520
and I'll translate them online
to understand.

12:04.600 --> 12:08.520
I'm not giving you my notes.
And you shouldn't be here.

12:08.600 --> 12:11.080
You're taking a spot
somebody else actually needs.

12:11.480 --> 12:14.240
Wait, do you think I am here to study? No.

12:14.480 --> 12:17.320
I'm here to meet the people
who rule the roost.

12:17.400 --> 12:21.560
They're not the ones with the best grades,
but the ones in with the right crowd.

12:22.160 --> 12:23.000
Watch.

12:24.160 --> 12:25.640
-What time's the party?
-Party?

12:25.720 --> 12:27.520
Somebody say party? Hi, I'm Christian.

12:28.880 --> 12:30.800
Hello, do you speak Spanish?

12:32.600 --> 12:34.160
I was talking to my friends.

12:34.240 --> 12:37.240
Oh, sorry.
By the way, are you on Instagram?

12:37.320 --> 12:38.960
I can give you mine if you want.

12:39.720 --> 12:41.200
Yes, please!

12:41.680 --> 12:44.480
It's pekechristian007.
The first one is a <i>k.</i>

12:44.600 --> 12:45.640
Pekechristian.

12:45.720 --> 12:48.560
Pekechristian. Oh, no!

12:48.640 --> 12:51.120
I've fucking had it with these people.

12:51.200 --> 12:54.000
I don't understand
how they got into this school.

12:54.520 --> 12:57.160
Wow, this video! Look at this.

12:58.640 --> 12:59.920
Do not touch me!

13:00.240 --> 13:01.320
Lu, don't be mean.

13:02.440 --> 13:03.800
Pay no attention to my friend.

13:03.880 --> 13:05.680
So, what about this party?

13:06.360 --> 13:09.640
My sister's coming-out party is private,
like our conversation.

13:12.880 --> 13:15.840
Who do I need to talk to
about getting an invite?

13:16.520 --> 13:18.400
You've never partied with me.

13:18.760 --> 13:20.560
You had a roof collapse on you, right?

13:21.160 --> 13:23.320
Maybe that impaired your ability
to take a hint.

13:23.400 --> 13:25.480
Shall I say it in English so you get it?

13:26.040 --> 13:26.880
Goodbye.

13:28.320 --> 13:30.760
-And if I don't feel like it?
-Look...

13:31.040 --> 13:33.520
You're slow,
so you don't get how things work here.

13:33.600 --> 13:36.000
But your friend there
is starting to get it.

13:36.080 --> 13:37.720
Come on, let's go, Guzmán.

13:40.800 --> 13:42.040
Cool video.

13:45.920 --> 13:48.560
<i>Christian, it can happen to anyone,</i>
<i>going too far.</i>

13:48.640 --> 13:50.920
It's the party
for the end of the school year...

13:51.280 --> 13:52.200
There's alcohol.

13:52.280 --> 13:54.480
I don't know,
maybe a fight gets out of control.

13:54.560 --> 13:58.640
What's that got to do with me?
I'm not like that.

14:03.320 --> 14:05.480
Can you interrogate me
without my parents here?

14:05.800 --> 14:07.280
These are just questions.

14:07.920 --> 14:11.200
But if you don't want to cooperate,
we can take you to the station.

14:11.280 --> 14:13.280
With your parents and a lawyer.

14:17.200 --> 14:18.840
How did you get that injury?

14:21.720 --> 14:23.000
Hit myself on a door.

14:28.280 --> 14:30.360
Why do I get the feeling you're lying?

14:35.280 --> 14:37.280
The change may end up
not being all that bad.

14:37.680 --> 14:39.640
How is your new school?

14:40.760 --> 14:42.600
I'm a Muslim, I don't play soccer,

14:42.680 --> 14:46.520
and I was caught reading in the hallway.
I'll be on wanted signs tomorrow.

14:46.600 --> 14:50.080
-The reward will be a reggaeton concert.
-I'm a dead man, then.

14:51.480 --> 14:55.160
Shit, man, I wish some rubble had fallen
on me when the school collapsed.

14:55.240 --> 14:57.120
Christian got 14 stitches.

14:57.240 --> 14:59.160
And a scholarship to Las Encinas,
dickhead.

14:59.240 --> 15:01.440
With any luck, the same will happen
at your new school.

15:01.520 --> 15:04.240
-No such luck, I'm afraid.
-Roofs do collapse.

15:04.720 --> 15:05.880
You're the worst!

15:07.480 --> 15:08.320
Hi.

15:14.640 --> 15:15.720
Look at him.

15:16.280 --> 15:18.120
He looks like a minister.

15:18.400 --> 15:19.600
Little brother!

15:20.120 --> 15:21.440
Little brother!

15:26.640 --> 15:27.920
Wow!

15:28.000 --> 15:30.200
-Doing well in fancyland, huh?
-Yes.

15:30.280 --> 15:32.920
-I'll fight anyone who bothers you.
-Why are you here?

15:33.000 --> 15:35.560
-Aren't you happy to see me?
-Yes! But they let you out?

15:35.640 --> 15:38.280
No, I'm still there. What do you think?
Let's have a beer.

15:38.720 --> 15:39.600
Here you go.

15:40.640 --> 15:41.560
Wow!

15:41.880 --> 15:43.240
This is nice, right?

15:43.800 --> 15:45.760
The three of us together again.

15:46.880 --> 15:48.760
-Let's go out tonight.
-I can't.

15:48.840 --> 15:50.520
-You can.
-I work tonight, Nano.

15:50.600 --> 15:52.080
Just call in sick.

15:52.160 --> 15:55.200
What if I get caught? It's the only job
we've had since you left.

15:56.800 --> 15:57.840
Is this how it's gonna be?

16:00.280 --> 16:03.080
Samu, I didn't leave. They made me leave.

16:06.280 --> 16:07.560
How was your first day?

16:08.040 --> 16:08.880
Very good.

16:23.000 --> 16:24.200
OPEN

16:24.840 --> 16:25.720
CLOSED

16:41.680 --> 16:43.040
How about this one?

16:44.320 --> 16:45.960
-Do you like it?
-Mom...

16:46.440 --> 16:49.000
You showed me yesterday.
The answer remains the same.

16:49.960 --> 16:51.640
You don't like anything, Marina.

16:52.200 --> 16:54.760
Is it that hard
to be a bit more enthusiastic?

16:55.880 --> 16:57.720
Mom and Dad are doing this for you.

16:58.680 --> 16:59.520
For me?

17:01.000 --> 17:02.400
Nobody asked them to.

17:02.520 --> 17:03.360
Sweetheart...

17:03.520 --> 17:07.560
We want to celebrate your coming of age
and to introduce you into society.

17:08.880 --> 17:11.560
As a virginal young lady
looking for a boyfriend.

17:12.000 --> 17:13.200
Marina, please.

17:14.120 --> 17:17.360
What? Are we never going to talk about it?

17:18.880 --> 17:20.760
What are the new students like?

17:23.360 --> 17:26.640
A moron, a fundamentalist,
and one with a raised fist.

17:27.560 --> 17:29.520
-As a joke, they'd be priceless.
-Hey...

17:30.560 --> 17:32.880
Why don't you invite one to the party?

17:34.680 --> 17:35.680
Are you serious?

17:37.120 --> 17:38.160
Why not?

17:40.120 --> 17:41.400
Have you lost your mind?

17:42.800 --> 17:45.560
Hello. No, I told you not to worry.

17:46.120 --> 17:48.200
-OK?
-I think it's a great idea.

17:50.080 --> 17:51.520
Besides, it's my party, right?

18:21.080 --> 18:22.440
Sons of bitches!

18:25.120 --> 18:26.000
Cool.

18:30.800 --> 18:32.720
Hey! Have you seen my uniform?

18:33.240 --> 18:34.600
No? Nothing?

18:35.240 --> 18:36.840
You haven't seen my clothes?

18:37.360 --> 18:38.640
What's up, handsome?

18:39.840 --> 18:41.960
Hello, beautiful.
You haven't seen my clothes?

18:43.320 --> 18:45.600
No? Come on! There we are!

18:47.560 --> 18:49.560
All right, then. Fuck you all.

18:49.760 --> 18:53.080
Enjoy the view! This one too, come on.

18:53.200 --> 18:55.240
You wish you had this ass!

18:59.360 --> 19:03.200
Hey, would you like to come to a party
at my place tomorrow evening?

19:03.840 --> 19:05.640
Why would you invite me to a party?

19:06.440 --> 19:09.360
Because I need somebody else
to enjoy it as little as I will.

19:10.480 --> 19:14.000
Besides, wouldn't you like
to see the look on my brother's face?

19:16.240 --> 19:17.360
OK.

19:26.000 --> 19:27.800
Your hair looks nice today.

19:30.520 --> 19:33.760
<i>Did you have any problems</i>
<i>with the other students?</i>

19:36.480 --> 19:37.960
No. Not with anybody.

19:39.840 --> 19:42.160
How was your relationship
with the other students?

19:44.000 --> 19:46.000
Did you get along? Were you friends?

19:49.560 --> 19:50.840
You're Ander, right?

19:52.480 --> 19:55.160
I've seen all your trophies, man.
I'm crazy about tennis.

19:58.080 --> 19:59.360
Come on, guys!

19:59.720 --> 20:01.000
To your next class!

20:01.080 --> 20:02.720
Anybody left in the locker room?

20:05.440 --> 20:06.480
What are you doing?

20:09.600 --> 20:11.600
-Anything wrong?
-No, why?

20:12.280 --> 20:13.840
OK, then. Off to class.

20:16.000 --> 20:17.360
Thanks a lot.

20:18.560 --> 20:22.440
-You're all right, bro.
-I'm not your bro. I just saved your ass.

20:23.400 --> 20:25.080
You could pay me back.

20:55.520 --> 20:56.880
Guzmán!

20:57.080 --> 20:58.360
-What?
-We've been seen!

20:58.440 --> 20:59.680
-What is it?
-Shit!

21:00.840 --> 21:02.400
-We were seen?
-Shit!

21:04.840 --> 21:08.560
Don't worry, he'll be here soon.
I talked to him ten minutes ago.

21:09.320 --> 21:12.040
Besides, nobody will see you here, man.
Don't worry.

21:12.320 --> 21:14.920
-But can he be trusted?
-Of course!

21:15.200 --> 21:18.760
What's he gonna do? Go on TV
to say a rich boy is buying joints?

21:18.840 --> 21:20.840
Come on! That wouldn't be news.

21:21.200 --> 21:23.040
I don't want them to know at school.

21:23.120 --> 21:25.640
Who's going to find out?
I won't tell. Don't worry.

21:25.720 --> 21:27.960
Besides, I don't have any friends there.
Or do I?

21:28.680 --> 21:30.520
Yeah! Good man!

21:31.640 --> 21:33.720
By the way,
I wanted to ask you something.

21:33.800 --> 21:36.680
-Shoot.
-Why do you all mess with us?

21:39.160 --> 21:41.280
Something happened
with a scholarship student.

21:41.400 --> 21:42.960
The son of one of the cooks.

21:43.040 --> 21:45.440
They didn't offer scholarships
for a full year.

21:45.680 --> 21:47.080
It was a huge mess.

21:47.720 --> 21:48.880
Until you arrived.

21:51.320 --> 21:52.160
Hey!

21:52.680 --> 21:54.040
What's up, man?

21:55.760 --> 21:57.160
-How are you?
-Hi.

21:57.800 --> 22:01.720
I'll introduce you. Mr. X, Mr. Dealer.
Sorry, no real names.

22:23.200 --> 22:24.280
Thanks, much obliged.

22:27.800 --> 22:30.160
You see how polite he is?
You can't complain,

22:30.240 --> 22:32.000
I bring you quality clients.

22:32.280 --> 22:33.440
Don't you forget.

22:34.120 --> 22:37.400
By the way, we'll talk soon.
You owe me one!

22:43.600 --> 22:47.000
Here we go, now we're all set!

22:47.400 --> 22:51.680
-Hey, my man!
-So good to see you!

22:52.840 --> 22:55.040
Twelve, thirteen, fourteen...

22:55.120 --> 22:57.960
Hang in there!
Fifteen, sixteen, that's it!

23:01.640 --> 23:04.840
So, they make a school collapse,
and get away with it.

23:04.920 --> 23:06.840
Can't wrap my fucking head around that!

23:08.120 --> 23:11.040
-When will the others be released?
-What do I know, man?

23:11.360 --> 23:12.800
That's how the world works.

23:12.880 --> 23:16.320
Some of us in jail for small shit,
and the real crooks out on the street.

23:16.400 --> 23:17.520
It figures.

23:17.720 --> 23:20.680
I almost didn't live to tell it.
I got a huge cut in my head.

23:20.760 --> 23:23.480
But, that got me a ticket to fancyland.

23:24.360 --> 23:27.760
It's no joke, Christian.
What if there had been casualties?

23:27.960 --> 23:31.000
This is not OK.
This country is a fucking joke.

23:31.840 --> 23:33.680
Get him a drink. We're losing him!

23:34.400 --> 23:35.920
-There are none left.
-None?

23:36.720 --> 23:38.960
I'll take care of it. I'll be right back.

23:43.400 --> 23:45.640
Man, save and you can buy it.

23:47.400 --> 23:49.800
A little stuck on that topic, isn't he?

23:50.720 --> 23:53.880
I mean, I don't know,
Nano is like a brother to me, you know.

23:54.280 --> 23:57.840
And... my brother's brother
is also my brother, right?

23:58.120 --> 23:59.280
You want my notes, right?

24:04.520 --> 24:06.520
Shit, man. That's fucking gross.

24:32.120 --> 24:34.120
WELCOME.
SHALL WE CREATE YOUR PROFILE?

24:34.200 --> 24:35.360
A GUY

24:56.320 --> 24:58.560
Look at him! Sleeping like a baby.

24:58.680 --> 24:59.520
Catch!

25:00.440 --> 25:02.320
I have an epic idea to end the night.

25:02.760 --> 25:04.280
Jaime, I'm taking it.

25:09.560 --> 25:11.160
Nano, tell me where we're going.

25:11.240 --> 25:14.040
To visit our friend
the owner of the construction company

25:14.120 --> 25:16.000
to give him something to remember us by.

25:18.560 --> 25:19.400
-Get off.
-What?

25:19.480 --> 25:20.320
Get off!

25:21.600 --> 25:22.440
Keep watch.

25:25.520 --> 25:28.160
No! What are you doing?
Don't even think about it!

25:28.240 --> 25:29.440
Let's live a little, Samu!

25:39.240 --> 25:40.080
Nano!

25:40.400 --> 25:43.440
You just got out of jail,
and this is the dumbest shit you could do!

25:47.360 --> 25:49.440
Nano, someone's coming! Nano!

25:49.520 --> 25:50.840
-Huh?
-Someone's coming. Let's go!

25:50.920 --> 25:51.840
Motherfucker...

25:51.920 --> 25:52.760
THI

25:52.840 --> 25:53.720
Come on!

26:01.440 --> 26:05.160
<i>Just one more thing, Nadia.</i>
<i>Help us, and then you can go.</i>

26:06.400 --> 26:09.200
What can you tell me about this trophy?

26:11.960 --> 26:12.800
Why?

26:17.080 --> 26:19.080
We think it's the murder weapon.

26:20.360 --> 26:21.200
What?

26:22.080 --> 26:24.920
We've been told
you wanted to win it more than anything.

26:28.720 --> 26:29.560
Just me?

26:30.480 --> 26:32.240
It's her word against ours.

26:32.800 --> 26:34.880
You want to risk them believing her?

26:37.280 --> 26:39.280
-This is all your fault.
-Mine?

26:39.360 --> 26:42.760
Yes, you and your silly obsession
with doing it in public places.

26:43.520 --> 26:44.360
Sure.

26:45.440 --> 26:46.840
As if you didn't like it.

26:57.720 --> 26:58.640
Hello.

27:01.440 --> 27:04.640
Sorry about yesterday.
We thought we were alone.

27:05.080 --> 27:05.920
If only.

27:10.040 --> 27:13.000
I know we started off
on the wrong foot. I'd like to fix that.

27:14.080 --> 27:17.120
Why don't you come
to my sister's party tonight?

27:19.240 --> 27:20.680
We can get to know each other.

27:25.200 --> 27:26.360
Thanks, but no.

27:29.880 --> 27:31.040
Have a nice day.

27:35.960 --> 27:36.920
Boo!

27:40.920 --> 27:41.760
I love her!

27:42.840 --> 27:43.920
Who? Carla?

27:45.320 --> 27:46.920
Her mother is a Spanish grandee.

27:47.600 --> 27:49.840
Do you know
Marquesado de Caleruega wines?

27:50.360 --> 27:52.680
-No.
-That's her mommy, the marchioness.

27:53.800 --> 27:57.080
That guy, Polo,
has been her boyfriend since they were 12.

27:57.160 --> 27:58.680
That guy? For real?

27:58.960 --> 28:02.000
No, come on, she deserves much better.
You're fucking kidding me!

28:02.840 --> 28:04.840
I'd watch out for the girls here.

28:04.960 --> 28:07.000
Yeah. I'll be watching this one.

28:15.120 --> 28:15.960
Nadia.

28:16.520 --> 28:17.360
How are you?

28:18.680 --> 28:21.280
Listen, I'd like you to come to my party.

28:22.040 --> 28:24.640
Thank you, but it isn't my scene.

28:25.400 --> 28:29.480
You can come in your scarf, or without it.
Come as you want, OK?

28:30.960 --> 28:31.920
It's called a hijab.

28:33.080 --> 28:34.120
Not a scarf.

28:34.400 --> 28:35.240
Hijab.

28:37.600 --> 28:40.280
-And nobody forces me to wear it.
-Lucky you!

28:41.240 --> 28:44.160
I do feel like I'm being forced
to have this ridiculous party.

28:46.920 --> 28:50.600
I don't know. Give us a chance.
We're not all like my brother.

28:53.080 --> 28:54.400
It starts at 8:00.

28:55.880 --> 28:57.320
Samuel has the address.

29:07.720 --> 29:11.360
-Fuck, man, this doesn't draw well.
-Don't make fun of the newbie, OK?

29:11.440 --> 29:12.440
I'm not making fun.

29:12.520 --> 29:15.800
For a first joint,
made with a tutorial, it's not bad.

29:21.600 --> 29:23.640
Why the fuck don't you wanna go
to the party?

29:25.920 --> 29:27.640
Stop obsessing about the party.

29:27.720 --> 29:29.600
I'm not obsessing.

29:29.680 --> 29:32.480
You may be used to all this luxury
and stuff, but I'm not.

29:32.560 --> 29:34.680
This is new to me. I'm excited about it.

29:34.760 --> 29:35.760
What do you think?

29:35.840 --> 29:38.080
-That I live like the rest of them?
-You don't?

29:38.760 --> 29:42.080
-Not even close.
-Then what are you doing at that school?

29:43.520 --> 29:45.760
Kid, I'm the principal's son.

29:46.640 --> 29:49.600
Son of a bitch! You've got connections!

29:51.400 --> 29:52.240
Anyway...

29:52.600 --> 29:54.600
-You want to go, right?
-Of course.

29:55.160 --> 29:57.440
-Are you positive?
-Completely, yes.

29:58.600 --> 30:02.000
-Do you have anything decent to wear?
-Of course I do, man!

30:06.040 --> 30:07.200
What are you doing here?

30:09.080 --> 30:11.080
Nadia wants to go to the party.

30:12.040 --> 30:14.200
My dad wants to be sure
there won't be alcohol

30:14.280 --> 30:18.040
and that parents will be there.
Just say yes. I want to go home.

30:18.120 --> 30:19.480
Yeah, man, don't worry.

30:23.560 --> 30:24.400
Damn!

30:25.040 --> 30:27.320
This is a serious party.

30:38.640 --> 30:39.480
THI

30:42.480 --> 30:44.080
What's up, Samu?

30:44.160 --> 30:46.480
-Hi.
-You didn't expect to see me here, huh?

30:47.480 --> 30:48.600
Let's go in!

31:12.880 --> 31:16.880
Here you have it, a coming-out party
in all its ridiculousness!

31:17.360 --> 31:18.320
What is it for?

31:19.480 --> 31:21.960
In other times, to find a husband quickly.

31:22.040 --> 31:24.200
Nowadays, it's more about networking.

31:24.280 --> 31:26.600
Although the husband thing
is not ruled out.

31:26.760 --> 31:28.480
You're so much fun when you drink.

31:28.560 --> 31:31.640
Wow, you rich people know
how to throw a party!

31:32.680 --> 31:33.640
Are you color-blind?

31:33.720 --> 31:36.520
Or did you not turn on the light
when you got dressed?

31:36.600 --> 31:37.520
Lu, don't be mean.

31:37.600 --> 31:39.360
Handsome guys look good
in anything.

31:40.760 --> 31:42.800
We've already said hi. Are you staying?

31:42.880 --> 31:45.600
I don't know.<i></i>Do you want me to stay?

31:46.960 --> 31:50.600
-If you say yes, I'll stay forever.
<i>-</i>Well, well, let's start with a drink.

31:50.680 --> 31:51.920
Please.

31:53.200 --> 31:54.080
Ah, move aside.

32:09.080 --> 32:11.520
Can you explain
why you brought the influencer?

32:11.600 --> 32:14.400
-You brought the girl, right?
-It's my home, Ander.

32:15.600 --> 32:18.560
I don't know, he wanted to come.
Nothing's going to happen.

32:18.800 --> 32:21.600
This whole crusade of yours
against them is ridiculous.

32:21.680 --> 32:22.560
Look...

32:22.800 --> 32:25.680
I forgive you,
because you're really drunk.

32:26.040 --> 32:27.920
But I'd never betray you like this!

32:30.320 --> 32:31.840
What betrayal, Guzmán?

32:32.520 --> 32:33.360
What betrayal?

32:37.360 --> 32:39.480
Fucking champagne! Where's the beer?

32:49.520 --> 32:50.360
You've come.

32:52.640 --> 32:53.480
Dad.

32:57.680 --> 32:58.920
Pleased to meet you.

33:00.040 --> 33:04.560
The balls on you, kid, showing up here!
Don't you know we have security cameras?

33:07.400 --> 33:08.720
Shall we talk later?

33:13.320 --> 33:15.680
Only alcohol can make this tolerable.
Here.

33:16.320 --> 33:18.120
Thanks. I don't drink.

33:19.040 --> 33:21.160
It's going to be a hard night, then.

33:22.040 --> 33:23.920
-I'm leaving soon.
-Of course.

33:24.200 --> 33:28.000
Why give us a chance if you've already
passed judgment on us all, right?

33:28.600 --> 33:31.200
Here's everything you hate about the West.

33:31.280 --> 33:33.040
All the sinful decadence.

33:33.800 --> 33:35.800
I thought I was the one judging.

33:36.680 --> 33:39.440
But I can see you've decided
what I think and what I don't.

33:39.520 --> 33:43.120
With a scarf on your head,
you can't possibly think much, dear.

33:44.480 --> 33:46.680
Is this about me
not accepting the champagne,

33:46.760 --> 33:48.280
or are you a born racist?

33:48.840 --> 33:50.800
Forgive me. Oh, no, forgive me.

33:50.880 --> 33:52.720
Sorry, I came here in peace, I swear.

33:52.800 --> 33:55.640
I'm sure you and I
have something in common.

33:58.800 --> 34:01.560
Don't worry.
I've come to Las Encinas to study.

34:01.840 --> 34:04.200
I'm not interested in anything
beyond that.

34:04.480 --> 34:06.920
Let me give you some advice, dear.

34:07.480 --> 34:08.600
You can do it all.

34:09.560 --> 34:10.640
Look at me.

34:10.720 --> 34:13.440
I date. I have fun, a lot.

34:14.120 --> 34:15.680
And I'm at the top of the class.

34:16.800 --> 34:17.640
Or you were.

34:17.720 --> 34:18.560
Right?

34:20.640 --> 34:21.480
So?

34:21.560 --> 34:23.000
What do you think of my party?

34:23.080 --> 34:25.240
Wouldn't you love to set us all on fire?

34:25.320 --> 34:27.560
OK. I'll order a glass of water,
just in case.

34:33.200 --> 34:34.360
Samuel...

34:34.600 --> 34:36.920
Sorry I didn't tell you
my dad's company...

34:37.240 --> 34:38.800
-was the one from your school.
-Right.

34:38.880 --> 34:41.920
-It would have been good to know.
-I'm not like him.

34:42.600 --> 34:44.880
And to be honest,
I think I don't even like him.

34:45.160 --> 34:46.640
But he's done this for you.

34:47.320 --> 34:51.200
Yeah, he's very good at solving problems
by throwing money at them.

34:57.000 --> 34:58.000
Wanna dance?

36:36.480 --> 36:37.960
-What?
-What's wrong?

36:38.080 --> 36:39.160
Don't you see?

36:40.280 --> 36:43.880
It's not about the skirt. I don't care.
It's that Taliban girl.

36:44.200 --> 36:45.720
That little hypocrite.

36:45.960 --> 36:48.880
Wearing a scarf on your head
makes you superior to us?

36:49.120 --> 36:50.240
Please, how ridiculous!

36:50.640 --> 36:53.400
I don't want her here,
but we have to keep her from telling.

36:53.720 --> 36:54.840
I have an idea.

36:55.960 --> 36:56.800
Let's hear it.

36:57.120 --> 36:58.160
I propose a game.

36:59.000 --> 37:00.480
Why don't you seduce her?

37:02.720 --> 37:05.760
Then everybody finds out...
and that's that.

37:06.560 --> 37:08.480
You want me to hook up
with the Palestinian

37:08.560 --> 37:10.040
who walks around in a turban?

37:10.120 --> 37:11.200
Oh, sweetie...

37:11.360 --> 37:15.920
the idea of making a virginal Muslim girl
fall for you doesn't turn you on?

37:16.680 --> 37:19.720
Come on, you woo her, she falls for you,
everybody finds out...

37:19.840 --> 37:23.120
That's it! We cut her down to size,
and she can't act all superior.

37:25.160 --> 37:26.680
Not even if I ask you?

37:27.400 --> 37:29.760
Then I'll let you do
whatever you want with me.

37:31.640 --> 37:33.400
I already do whatever I want with you.

37:34.600 --> 37:35.960
Not even half of it.

37:42.760 --> 37:45.560
I'm thinking today
would be a good day to do it. Right?

37:45.640 --> 37:48.800
I call the tow truck,
and they don't come for me.

37:51.800 --> 37:52.960
Well, I don't know.

37:54.480 --> 37:55.680
Here? Right now?

37:57.200 --> 37:58.200
And why not?

37:59.520 --> 38:01.840
But if you're not sure,
let's forget about it.

38:18.160 --> 38:19.160
Hey.

38:20.240 --> 38:21.520
-Samuel, right?
-Yes.

38:22.480 --> 38:25.880
What exactly did you mean to write here,
on my front wall?

38:26.120 --> 38:28.320
T-H-I...

38:28.600 --> 38:29.440
S.

38:29.680 --> 38:31.520
"This above all:
to thine own self be true."

38:31.800 --> 38:33.400
-Ah.
-It's a quote from <i>Hamlet.</i>

38:33.480 --> 38:36.600
Yes, of course, a quote from <i>Hamlet.</i>
Ingenious.

38:36.840 --> 38:37.680
But...

38:38.800 --> 38:40.760
I think you wanted to write...

38:41.040 --> 38:42.520
thief, son of a bitch,

38:42.600 --> 38:45.080
or one of those names
the press is calling me lately.

38:45.160 --> 38:48.880
Bring the other scholarship kids,
and we'll take a photo of the four of us.

38:48.960 --> 38:50.840
Shaking hands and smiling.

38:52.360 --> 38:53.200
I don't know.

38:53.720 --> 38:54.640
Come on, man.

38:54.720 --> 38:57.800
What's wrong with taking a photo?
It could be good for everybody.

38:57.880 --> 39:00.680
For the town, for the school,
even for you.

39:01.040 --> 39:03.040
I wouldn't feel comfortable doing it.

39:04.440 --> 39:05.320
It's OK, kid.

39:05.400 --> 39:09.280
I'll report your brother tomorrow.
Let's see what happens to his parole.

39:11.320 --> 39:12.440
Think about it.

39:23.640 --> 39:24.480
What did he say?

39:25.600 --> 39:27.360
He wants a photo
with the scholarship students.

39:27.440 --> 39:28.840
-Really?
-Yes.

39:29.440 --> 39:32.600
That's why he wanted me to invite you.
His image makeover bullshit.

39:34.200 --> 39:36.200
He doesn't waste an opportunity.

39:37.640 --> 39:39.760
Samuel, don't play along.
You don't have to.

39:40.040 --> 39:41.400
I don't mind doing it.

39:46.560 --> 39:47.400
What's wrong?

39:48.520 --> 39:52.880
Nothing.<i></i>I don't know.
I thought you were different.

40:03.920 --> 40:04.760
Hello.

40:48.720 --> 40:50.520
COME GET ME?

40:54.440 --> 40:56.560
Come on, we have things to do.

41:06.520 --> 41:08.000
What is this?

41:10.040 --> 41:10.880
Olé.

41:12.120 --> 41:15.080
We have 15 minutes
before they realize I'm not there.

41:18.160 --> 41:19.800
Are you taking your clothes off?

41:31.560 --> 41:34.600
That comes off, too.
But slowly, so I can see you.

41:36.760 --> 41:38.560
OK. And you too.

41:39.280 --> 41:40.760
Let's do it at the same time.

42:28.880 --> 42:29.800
Like this?

42:30.840 --> 42:32.080
Am I doing it right?

42:32.200 --> 42:33.760
Yes, you're doing fucking great.

42:41.040 --> 42:43.080
HEY, COOL PROFILE

42:45.920 --> 42:47.920
YOURS TOO. WHAT'S UP?

42:48.800 --> 42:50.800
BORED. WANT TO MEET?

42:52.040 --> 42:53.920
DO YOU HAVE ANOTHER PHOTO?

43:02.040 --> 43:04.240
I can't believe it.
Explain it to me, please.

43:05.000 --> 43:07.920
You knew it was him who ruined our wall,

43:08.160 --> 43:09.960
and you let him in our home?

43:10.200 --> 43:11.040
Who?

43:11.120 --> 43:13.160
The skinny kid.

43:13.280 --> 43:16.120
Because he had ulterior motives.
He wanted a picture with him.

43:17.680 --> 43:18.520
What?

43:19.520 --> 43:21.920
Mom, I don't know why you are surprised.

43:22.240 --> 43:25.200
You are the only one
Dad still manages to disappoint.

43:27.560 --> 43:29.360
Those people are poison.
You know it.

43:29.440 --> 43:32.520
Why are you with them every time
I turn around, Marina? Why?

43:32.600 --> 43:33.800
Why don't you leave them alone?

43:33.880 --> 43:36.240
Because I refuse
to let you get hurt again, Marina!

43:36.320 --> 43:38.640
-Pablo did not mean to hurt me!
-Marina!

43:39.440 --> 43:41.280
Now is not the time. Please.

43:42.920 --> 43:46.480
Then when?
Tell me, when is the right time?

43:47.600 --> 43:49.280
Why can't we talk about it?

43:50.520 --> 43:54.320
You've spent a fortune on psychologists
to convince me nothing happened.

43:54.840 --> 43:57.200
That life goes on.
That everything would be fine.

43:57.760 --> 43:58.600
And you know what?

44:00.880 --> 44:04.200
Every time you avoid the subject,
I feel like a piece of shit.

44:05.920 --> 44:08.600
I fell in love with a boy. He infected me.

44:10.000 --> 44:11.440
I need you to say it!

44:12.360 --> 44:13.600
Say it! Say it, Mom!

44:15.520 --> 44:18.080
"My 16-year-old daughter is HIV-positive."

44:40.000 --> 44:41.440
Do you regret tonight?

44:42.240 --> 44:44.800
It was... intense.

44:45.240 --> 44:46.240
But it was good.

44:47.040 --> 44:47.880
You're sure?

44:48.920 --> 44:49.840
Good night.

44:59.600 --> 45:02.240
GOOD NIGHT, GORGEOUS

45:06.560 --> 45:09.040
I love you. I love you more than ever.

45:25.240 --> 45:28.640
You!<i></i>This is how you thank us
for your scholarship?

45:28.720 --> 45:31.120
-Guzmán!
-By vandalizing other people's property?

45:31.440 --> 45:33.400
-You disgust me!
-What's going on here?

45:34.080 --> 45:34.920
And who are you?

45:35.000 --> 45:37.680
Unbelievable,
the riffraff we have here tonight!

45:37.760 --> 45:39.680
Should I take that as a compliment
or punch you?

45:39.760 --> 45:41.040
Take it as you will.

45:41.120 --> 45:43.360
-Let's go.
-I won't let this prep boy insult us.

45:43.440 --> 45:45.600
I'm not insulting you,
just stating the facts.

45:45.720 --> 45:46.560
One question.

45:46.640 --> 45:49.880
What do you call people who keep millions
that don't belong to them

45:49.960 --> 45:51.880
so they can live the way you do?

45:52.240 --> 45:54.400
Thieves or simply bastards?

45:55.840 --> 45:58.360
How dare you come to this house

45:58.800 --> 46:00.520
to insult me and my family?

46:00.600 --> 46:02.880
Who do you think you are, fucking clown?

46:03.720 --> 46:05.200
-What are you doing?
-OK.

46:05.280 --> 46:06.680
You don't deserve my brother!

46:06.760 --> 46:07.920
Get off me!

46:08.720 --> 46:11.440
Shove your money up your asses!

46:12.960 --> 46:14.400
You! Hey!

46:14.480 --> 46:15.400
You are finished!

46:15.960 --> 46:19.080
Tomorrow, everybody at school
will know you are a fucking criminal!

46:19.560 --> 46:20.840
Forget about your scholarship!

46:20.920 --> 46:22.920
Guzmán. Are you OK?
Did they hurt you?

46:32.800 --> 46:33.880
Does it hurt a lot?

46:35.480 --> 46:36.320
Polo...

46:36.880 --> 46:39.680
Why don't you get lost
and stop making a fool of yourself?

46:40.120 --> 46:40.960
Go!

46:44.600 --> 46:45.440
Guzmán,

46:46.200 --> 46:48.360
don't take it out on Samuel.
He's a good person.

46:48.960 --> 46:51.080
Let's see
what the principal says tomorrow.

46:51.520 --> 46:54.120
Your sister is right.
Samuel is a good person.

46:54.600 --> 46:55.520
Me, not so much.

46:56.480 --> 46:59.960
If you say anything at school,
I'll share what I saw in the shower.

47:02.320 --> 47:03.440
Thanks for inviting me.

47:07.680 --> 47:08.520
Nadia.

47:08.800 --> 47:10.160
Nadia, you win.

47:11.480 --> 47:14.480
I lost my temper.
I won't tell on your friend.

47:17.000 --> 47:21.560
Stay a little longer.
Let me show you we are worth the trouble.

47:24.760 --> 47:26.840
You all are too good
at looking down on people.

47:27.680 --> 47:29.040
Teach me how to look at you.

47:30.480 --> 47:32.000
I promise I'll be a fast learner.

47:40.200 --> 47:41.600
What's going on, honey?

47:44.840 --> 47:47.080
This one needs to be taken down
a peg or two.

48:08.880 --> 48:09.720
Hey.

48:28.200 --> 48:31.440
Are you gonna say nothing all night?
After I stood up for you?

48:31.520 --> 48:34.120
You are clueless.
Do you know what I've done for you?

48:34.200 --> 48:36.600
I had it under control,
and you had to make a mess.

48:36.680 --> 48:38.080
Now I have to clean it up.

48:38.160 --> 48:41.480
I was protecting you, asshole!
Like I have my entire fucking life.

48:41.560 --> 48:42.640
I never asked you to!

48:42.720 --> 48:46.920
Come on, Samu! I won't let those people,
who are a real cancer, laugh at you!

48:47.040 --> 48:50.400
You've been blaming them your whole life.
Maybe you're the cancer.

49:34.240 --> 49:35.560
Is Samuel home?

49:48.400 --> 49:49.360
Is Samuel here?

49:49.440 --> 49:50.440
He's sleeping.

49:52.520 --> 49:54.720
He was up all night hugging the toilet.

49:55.360 --> 49:56.520
He says it's a hangover,

49:56.600 --> 49:59.120
but it's the fear of having to go back
to that school.

50:01.600 --> 50:03.240
He can come back, no problem.

50:03.320 --> 50:05.640
I came to tell him
my brother won't say anything.

50:06.240 --> 50:07.120
Very well.

50:08.000 --> 50:09.360
Anything else?

50:09.840 --> 50:11.920
Coffee, water, beer?

50:12.320 --> 50:13.800
Sit down if you want.

50:20.080 --> 50:21.560
Did you tag my wall?

50:26.920 --> 50:28.280
My letter of introduction.

50:31.040 --> 50:32.560
Next time, finish it.

50:35.680 --> 50:37.480
I liked what you said at the party.

50:38.000 --> 50:41.080
You dared to shout what a lot of us think.
Or at least I do.

50:41.760 --> 50:43.400
Somebody had to say it.

51:02.800 --> 51:04.960
And... is it true you've been to jail?

51:06.080 --> 51:07.880
You love to ask questions, huh?

51:09.640 --> 51:11.160
Yes, but only for a short while.

51:11.240 --> 51:12.960
Sleeping badly, eating worse.

51:13.040 --> 51:16.120
No women,
unless you count my mother, my lawyer,

51:16.200 --> 51:19.080
and my second aunt from Murcia.
I'm not sure why she came.

51:20.280 --> 51:22.200
None like you, I can tell you that.

51:26.560 --> 51:28.360
Stay any longer,
and I'll make you iron.

51:29.840 --> 51:30.680
I'll go.

51:30.760 --> 51:31.600
You'd better.

51:36.680 --> 51:38.640
-Bye.
-Bye.

52:01.320 --> 52:04.440
Here you go. Washed and pressed.
By the way...

52:04.520 --> 52:07.360
fancy girl was here.
She wants you to go back to school.

55:27.640 --> 55:30.400
