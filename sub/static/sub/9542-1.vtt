00:45.602 --> 00:46.972
The stove.

00:47.007 --> 00:48.821
Over here.
It's in the kitchen.

00:48.856 --> 00:51.783
No, I mean my stove.
I think I left it on.

00:51.818 --> 00:53.850
It's okay.

00:54.171 --> 00:56.861
I, uh, checked it
as we were leaving.

00:56.896 --> 00:58.493
Are you sure?
Did you turn the knob?

00:58.528 --> 00:59.914
Yeah.

00:59.949 --> 01:02.840
- The little knob, though?
- I turned all the knobs.

01:02.875 --> 01:04.171
The stove is off, Adrian.

01:04.206 --> 01:07.413
Excuse me, sir, we believe
it was a burglary gone sour.

01:07.448 --> 01:10.010
She walked in, she surprised him,
he panicked,

01:10.045 --> 01:11.190
- No. No.
- He left there from the kitchen.

01:11.225 --> 01:12.875
No, no.

01:12.910 --> 01:15.426
No. No. This...

01:15.461 --> 01:17.486
- This was no burglary.
- It wasn't?

01:17.521 --> 01:21.904
He tried to make it look like one,
but this guy was cold as ice.

01:23.642 --> 01:27.146
He wore her slippers to
avoid leaving shoe prints...

01:27.181 --> 01:31.421
not something your neighborhood
crackhead is prone to do.

01:31.456 --> 01:34.445
Adrian. Adrian

01:42.806 --> 01:44.726
He was in here.
He was waiting.

01:44.761 --> 01:46.677
Waiting for what?

01:47.174 --> 01:48.628
You know, for her.

01:48.663 --> 01:51.748
He was here at least an hour.

01:51.783 --> 01:55.309
He was smoking.
You can still smell it on the curtains.

01:56.741 --> 01:59.400
Menthols. Salems.

02:00.323 --> 02:02.875
- Possibly Newports.
- Maybe she was the smoker.

02:02.910 --> 02:05.705
No. No, she was a Dutch Calvinist.
They don't smoke.

02:05.740 --> 02:09.340
They consider their
bodies to be a holy...

02:09.375 --> 02:11.261
a holy chalice of...

02:11.296 --> 02:14.765
Sorry, I'm having trouble concentrating,
because I think I smell gas.

02:14.800 --> 02:15.818
Did you hear the click?

02:15.853 --> 02:19.870
You gotta hear the click,
not just feel the click. Hear it.

02:23.763 --> 02:25.649
Anyway, uh,

02:25.684 --> 02:29.358
- after he killed Miss, uh...
- Nicole Vasques, 25.

02:29.393 --> 02:32.515
Yeah, Miss Vasques,
hehe hung around.

02:32.550 --> 02:34.639
He was, uh,
looking for something.

02:34.674 --> 02:36.431
He was looking for what?

02:37.162 --> 02:39.187
I don't know.

02:39.488 --> 02:42.338
He checked something
on her computer.

02:42.465 --> 02:44.015
He could have erased a file.

02:44.050 --> 02:46.067
- Anything else?
- Yes, he's tall.

02:46.102 --> 02:49.207
He's 6'3", maybe 6'4".

02:49.242 --> 02:50.882
What about the pilot light?

02:50.917 --> 02:53.141
- Because sometimes it goes out.
- The pilot light is fine.

02:53.176 --> 02:55.253
Do you remember the
last time it almost went out?

02:55.288 --> 02:58.029
Do you want me to drive back to
the city and check the stove?

02:58.064 --> 02:59.575
- No.
- Is that what you're telling me to do?

02:59.610 --> 03:00.899
No, no, no.

03:00.934 --> 03:04.405
Would you? Could you?

03:04.440 --> 03:05.775
That would be great.

03:05.810 --> 03:08.981
Oh, excuse me, gentlemen.
Just one second, okay? Just...

03:10.156 --> 03:12.490
- Who is she?
- Just his nurse.

03:12.525 --> 03:16.212
Forget about the damn stove, okay?
You are on a job here.

03:16.247 --> 03:19.107
- You're a private consultant.
- I know, but I smelled it and I think...

03:19.142 --> 03:21.828
You gotta shut up.
The department thinks you're nuts.

03:21.863 --> 03:25.066
You're never gonna get reinstated,
you're never gonna get hired again,

03:25.101 --> 03:27.703
and we are both
gonna be unemployed.

03:27.738 --> 03:31.484
Do you understand the
importance of what I am saying?

03:33.465 --> 03:37.289
Now, pull your
twisted self together,

03:37.324 --> 03:40.282
concentrate and be brilliant.

03:42.347 --> 03:44.236
You're brilliant.

03:44.556 --> 03:47.098
Excuse me, sir,
I'm sure that you're right,

03:47.133 --> 03:48.995
but how do you know all of that?

03:49.030 --> 03:51.244
- I mean, about the computer...
- It's patently obvious, isn't it?

03:51.279 --> 03:53.568
There are no prints on
the keyboard, not even hers.

03:53.603 --> 03:56.849
Why? He used it.
He wiped them clean.

03:56.884 --> 03:59.529
Right. And you
said that he was tall.

03:59.564 --> 04:03.482
The victim's short, maybe 5'4".

04:03.517 --> 04:06.512
Look at the chair.
It's lowered almost all the way.

04:07.531 --> 04:09.694
We've been here all morning,
and nobody even noticed that.

04:09.729 --> 04:13.269
Sir, if you can stick around for a bit,
the coroner's on his way.

04:13.510 --> 04:14.848
No, I'm sorry. I gotta go.

04:14.883 --> 04:16.315
I'm pretty sure I smell gas.

04:16.350 --> 04:20.003
Gentlemen, you know
where to find us. Just call.

04:22.686 --> 04:26.751
- So that's the famous Adrian Monk?
- Yeah, the living legend.

04:27.533 --> 04:29.511
If you call that living.

04:30.870 --> 04:34.799
MONK Season 1 Epi. 01,02
Mr. Monk and the Candidate

04:48.811 --> 04:52.367
31, 32, 33, 34, 35,
36, 37, 38, 39, 40.

04:52.402 --> 04:54.876
Doc, I'm feeling great.

04:54.911 --> 04:58.814
Dr. Kroger...
I'm doing great, Dr. Kroger.

04:59.765 --> 05:02.216
You can't...
You can't sweat the small stuff.

05:02.251 --> 05:05.347
Just keep going with the flow.

05:08.087 --> 05:10.922
It's a new me.
It's a whole new me.

05:10.957 --> 05:14.073
And thanks to you...
I owe it all to you.

05:14.338 --> 05:17.569
I feel like I'm back in the saddle.

05:19.668 --> 05:22.202
I owe it all to you, Doc.

05:24.183 --> 05:26.645
Took your advice, Doc.

05:27.884 --> 05:30.108
I'm going with the flow.

05:40.449 --> 05:42.618
So...

05:42.692 --> 05:45.170
going with the flow?

05:46.784 --> 05:49.789
Good. Good for you.

05:49.824 --> 05:52.887
You've been, what,
doing some consulting?

05:52.922 --> 05:54.839
Yeah, in Santa Clara.

05:54.874 --> 05:59.482
I have an old friend there
who's a second lieutenant and...

05:59.517 --> 06:01.575
called me in.

06:02.982 --> 06:04.973
Well, how'd that make you feel?

06:05.008 --> 06:08.036
I mean, you know,
being called in?

06:08.071 --> 06:09.935
It feels great.

06:09.970 --> 06:12.539
It feels like old times.

06:16.509 --> 06:18.779
Back in the saddle.

06:20.395 --> 06:23.682
Well, do you think you're
ready to go back full time?

06:23.717 --> 06:28.008
No, I don't mean consulting.
You know I mean back on the force.

06:28.043 --> 06:31.533
Definitely. Absolutely.

06:31.568 --> 06:34.375
Do you think I'm ready?
That's...

06:34.410 --> 06:36.480
That's the question.

06:36.877 --> 06:38.726
Are you okay?

06:38.761 --> 06:40.557
Yeah, I'm fine.

06:40.592 --> 06:45.210
You keep looking at that pillow.
If you want to fix the pillow, it's okay.

06:45.245 --> 06:48.244
No, no, no, I was
just thinking about...

06:48.279 --> 06:49.841
No, I'm... I'm fine.

06:49.876 --> 06:53.872
How are you sleeping?
Are you still having those dreams?

06:53.907 --> 06:57.738
Well, Trudy and I were
married for seven years.

06:58.351 --> 07:01.343
It would be weird if I...

07:01.378 --> 07:04.597
if I never dreamt about her, right?
You're testing me, aren't you?

07:04.632 --> 07:07.122
You... You left it like
that on purpose.

07:07.157 --> 07:08.523
Did I?

07:11.239 --> 07:14.490
Okay. Okay.

07:14.916 --> 07:18.018
Yeah, so, anyway, um,

07:18.544 --> 07:21.977
I've... I've been feeling...

07:22.012 --> 07:23.554
Excuse me.

07:27.610 --> 07:28.987
Hold it. That...

07:29.022 --> 07:30.954
That one's just...

07:31.709 --> 07:33.936
There. Then, uh...

07:34.242 --> 07:38.047
Okay. No big deal.

07:43.374 --> 07:45.100
Where were we?

08:38.129 --> 08:41.039
You people sound like
you're ready for a change.

08:41.706 --> 08:43.736
Am I right, or am I right?

08:44.621 --> 08:47.168
The band doesn't start playing
until the balloons go, okay, right?

08:47.203 --> 08:49.833
San Francisco has
a simple decision to make.

08:49.868 --> 08:51.111
Wait for my cue.

08:51.146 --> 08:54.332
Do we tread water,
or do we move ahead?

08:55.369 --> 08:57.100
But, hell, that's all right.

08:57.135 --> 08:59.291
Hey, how we doing?

08:59.326 --> 09:02.708
I'm getting lockjaw, Gavin.
When can I stop smiling?

09:02.743 --> 09:05.215
I'm afraid you're gonna
have to get used to it, Miranda.

09:05.250 --> 09:09.924
I told you when I signed on,
city hall is just the beginning.

09:09.959 --> 09:14.860
I am your Moses, and I am gonna take
you and your husband to the promised land.

09:14.895 --> 09:18.596
- As my old man used to say...
- I've seen Sacramento, Gavin.

09:18.631 --> 09:20.183
It's hardly the promised land.

09:20.218 --> 09:22.713
Forget Sacramento.
I'm talking about the White House.

09:22.748 --> 09:25.505
And don't forget,
when you elect me,

09:25.540 --> 09:28.620
you're getting two mayors
for the price of one.

09:28.655 --> 09:30.649
My wife, Miranda.

09:35.142 --> 09:37.189
I'm not just talking the talk.

09:37.224 --> 09:40.805
I'm ready to walk the walk.
Are you ready to walk with me?

09:40.840 --> 09:42.101
Yeah!

09:55.856 --> 09:57.442
He's up there!

09:58.533 --> 10:00.671
Up there!

10:05.849 --> 10:07.822
Okay, I'll call you back.
I'll call you back.

10:08.697 --> 10:10.791
St. Claire just issued
another statement.

10:10.826 --> 10:13.636
- Is he blaming us?
- Not yet. Just rahrah stuff.

10:13.671 --> 10:15.683
He will not be silenced.
He will not be intimidated.

10:15.718 --> 10:19.319
He will be blaming us soon enough.
Everybody does sooner or later.

10:19.354 --> 10:21.277
We gotta make a statement too.

10:21.312 --> 10:24.092
- Is the press here? Who's here?
- The girl from channel 3.

10:24.127 --> 10:26.589
- The pretty one?
- No, the other one.

10:27.178 --> 10:29.625
It's okay. - Good.
Who do you want on camera?

10:29.660 --> 10:31.866
Me. I'll do it.

10:32.361 --> 10:35.361
I think it'll reassure people
to see me taking point.

10:35.396 --> 10:37.574
Yes, sir. - Anything
on the shooter? Say yes.

10:37.609 --> 10:41.092
The forensic boys are still on site,
but nothing so far.

10:41.127 --> 10:43.020
Incoming: Deputy mayor.

10:43.197 --> 10:45.423
Oh, Sheldon Burger,
who let you off your leash?

10:45.458 --> 10:49.215
I just came from the hospital.
Bodyguard didn't make it.

10:49.611 --> 10:52.068
Mayor's on his way
back from Sacramento.

10:52.103 --> 10:54.986
Look, I don't have to tell you, Captain.
We're on a bus to hell.

10:55.021 --> 10:56.837
- I understand.
- If we don't slamdunk this,

10:56.872 --> 10:59.653
- It's gonna look like we're not trying.
- I'm not an idiot, Sheldon.

10:59.688 --> 11:01.797
I've got every
available man on the case.

11:01.832 --> 11:06.268
No, you don't. Mayor wants
you to bring in your old friend.

11:07.782 --> 11:09.378
Monk?

11:10.830 --> 11:12.530
- Bus! Bus! Bus!
- I still can't believe this.

11:12.565 --> 11:14.564
The mayor asked
for you personally.

11:14.599 --> 11:16.470
There's a bus on the right.

11:16.505 --> 11:19.998
Oh, this is great. This is gonna get
you back on the force. I'm telling you.

11:20.438 --> 11:22.701
I already have a job, remember?

11:22.736 --> 11:25.680
The girl in Santa Clara?
Merging! Merging! Everybody's mer...

11:25.715 --> 11:27.534
- You want to drive?
- What lane are you in?

11:27.569 --> 11:29.065
You want to drive?

11:29.100 --> 11:31.413
I'll sit there and yell and
point and drive you nuts,

11:31.448 --> 11:33.541
'cause you're
driving me nuts, Adrian.

11:33.731 --> 11:35.350
Sorry.

11:38.334 --> 11:41.648
It's red! It's red!
Come on, it's red!

11:43.486 --> 11:46.079
Be cool. No, not today.
You can't today.

11:46.114 --> 11:49.160
Look who's here...
the defective detective.

11:50.905 --> 11:53.075
- Hello, Monk.
- Captain.

11:54.788 --> 11:56.978
- Sharona.
- Hi.

12:00.156 --> 12:02.337
You look good.

12:02.468 --> 12:04.484
Dr. Kroger says you've
been getting out some.

12:04.519 --> 12:07.017
Oh, he is really doing great.

12:07.052 --> 12:08.667
I can't even keep up
with him. Thanks.

12:08.702 --> 12:12.283
Excellent. The candidate is
waiting for us upstairs.

12:12.318 --> 12:14.054
I wanted to make this crystalclear.

12:14.089 --> 12:16.484
You're here because the mayor
thinks you can walk on water,

12:16.519 --> 12:18.086
but you're a civilian now, Monk.

12:18.121 --> 12:20.881
You have observer
status only, okay?

12:20.916 --> 12:24.922
When I'm in there, I talk.
You say nothing, understand?

12:25.687 --> 12:28.478
Look, Monk, when I took
your badge three years ago,

12:28.513 --> 12:30.631
I told you nothing would
give me more pleasure

12:30.632 --> 12:32.703
than to see you reinstated,
and I meant that.

12:33.502 --> 12:35.723
But you're obviously not ready.

12:35.758 --> 12:37.586
Is that you talking
or the uniform?

12:37.621 --> 12:39.250
I am the uniform, Monk.

12:39.285 --> 12:42.276
You didn't understand that back
when I was your watch commander.

12:42.704 --> 12:45.548
You stay out of my way,
and we'll be fine. - Yes, sir.

12:46.173 --> 12:50.055
And I'm sure you and
Karen will work things out.

12:51.823 --> 12:53.736
What did you say?

12:53.885 --> 12:57.184
You and your wife...
you're having some problems.

12:57.910 --> 13:00.560
What are you talking about?
Karen and I are fine.

13:00.595 --> 13:02.730
- We're 100%.
- Yes, sir.

13:02.765 --> 13:04.369
My mistake.

13:04.404 --> 13:06.285
Um, never been
happier to be wrong.

13:08.881 --> 13:11.192
Hey, Monk, come here.

13:14.512 --> 13:16.381
How did you know that?

13:16.728 --> 13:19.289
You missed a spot shaving.
Karen would have caught that.

13:19.324 --> 13:21.277
And your necktie...
she always ties it for you.

13:21.312 --> 13:22.871
She used that double slipknot.

13:22.906 --> 13:24.817
Conclusion...
you dressed yourself.

13:24.852 --> 13:28.604
And, uh, the Ramada Inn cup.

13:30.270 --> 13:33.550
Send her some...
roses maybe.

13:36.172 --> 13:38.816
When we get in there,
you don't say anything.

13:38.851 --> 13:40.478
No, no, no. Forget it.

13:40.513 --> 13:42.528
We're four points
behind with ten days to go.

13:42.563 --> 13:44.373
I am not putting
my man in a box.

13:44.408 --> 13:47.163
Nobody wants to put
anybody in a box, Mr. Lloyd.

13:47.198 --> 13:49.938
All we want to do is
limit your public appearances...

13:49.973 --> 13:51.931
and not announce
your schedule in advance.

13:51.966 --> 13:53.105
The mayor would love that.

13:53.140 --> 13:55.198
Maybe we should move the whole
campaign and run it from the basement.

13:55.233 --> 13:56.114
How about that?

13:56.149 --> 13:59.426
Gavin, that's not fair.
The captain's just doing his job.

13:59.461 --> 14:02.341
Mr. St. Claire, can you think of
anybody who might wish you harm?

14:02.376 --> 14:05.734
- A disgruntled employee?
- Or an exwife.

14:05.769 --> 14:10.925
Or a union official. I know a couple
of exbusiness partners...

14:10.960 --> 14:14.436
who no longer send
us Christmas cards.

14:14.681 --> 14:16.870
You boys have your
work cut out for you.

14:16.905 --> 14:20.327
A man who hasn't made any
enemies hasn't done squat.

14:20.362 --> 14:22.310
Warren, you're sure you
want to go through with this?

14:22.345 --> 14:24.556
After yesterday, no one
would blame you if you quit.

14:24.591 --> 14:27.531
Jesse, you used to say
"quit"was a fourletter word.

14:27.566 --> 14:29.507
Excuse me.
We haven't been introduced.

14:29.542 --> 14:30.522
I'm sorry. Who are you?

14:30.557 --> 14:32.749
Uh, Jesse Goodman.
I work upstairs.

14:32.784 --> 14:36.699
Senior vice president
? concerned friend.

14:36.845 --> 14:41.698
I couldn't make this run if Jesse
wasn't upstairs minding the store.

14:42.565 --> 14:43.785
Baby.

14:45.449 --> 14:49.281
- Do you need that?
- Yes, I do.

14:49.316 --> 14:53.591
Somebody tried to kill my husband
yesterday right in front of me.

14:53.626 --> 14:57.016
- Monk.
- Excuse me!

14:57.051 --> 14:59.796
What... What are you doing?

15:00.187 --> 15:01.712
I was just straightening up.

15:01.747 --> 15:04.883
Oh, my God. Excuse me!
That's color coded by voting precinct.

15:04.918 --> 15:07.570
It took me three weeks
to set this up.

15:07.605 --> 15:09.159
- Sorry.
- Monk!

15:09.194 --> 15:11.041
What department are you with?

15:11.076 --> 15:13.719
Ma'am, this is Adrian Monk.
He's no longer with our department.

15:13.754 --> 15:15.568
He's here as
a private consultant.

15:15.603 --> 15:17.382
I'll put them all back
the way they were.

15:17.417 --> 15:20.165
No, stop. You can't possibly
remember how everything was.

15:20.200 --> 15:21.944
Yes, he can.
Yes, he can.

15:21.979 --> 15:23.862
- It won't take too long.
- No.

15:23.897 --> 15:25.959
It'd take one second.

15:25.994 --> 15:28.129
Adrian, let go of the board!

15:33.236 --> 15:35.873
Captain, you said he's
no longer with the department?

15:35.908 --> 15:39.098
- He was given a 315.
- Psychological discharge.

15:39.133 --> 15:41.101
- It's a temporary suspension.
- Psychological discharge.

15:41.136 --> 15:43.193
It's a temporary suspension.

15:43.228 --> 15:46.928
- He's up for a review next week.
- Is this a joke?

15:46.963 --> 15:50.695
Someone tries to kill my husband,
and you send in Rain Man?

15:50.730 --> 15:54.034
Mrs. St. Claire, I can assure you,
Mr. Monk's involvement...

15:54.069 --> 15:56.988
is an indication ofjust how seriously
we are taking this case.

15:57.023 --> 15:58.464
Is he, uh...

15:58.630 --> 16:02.295
No, no. Um, it's
a form of anxiety disorder.

16:02.330 --> 16:06.494
A severe case like this is usually
triggered by a single traumatic incident.

16:06.529 --> 16:08.381
Someone hit him with a shovel?

16:08.416 --> 16:12.788
His wife was murdered
four years ago... a car bomb.

16:14.687 --> 16:16.390
There!

16:17.716 --> 16:19.363
Unbelievable.

16:19.398 --> 16:20.897
Wait.

16:24.366 --> 16:26.123
There.

16:28.290 --> 16:30.367
Now I'd like to see...

16:30.402 --> 16:33.139
where the shots were fired from.

16:45.000 --> 16:46.861
What's he doing?

16:46.896 --> 16:49.139
I love this part.

16:49.174 --> 16:52.914
He does this Zen,
Sherlock Holmes thing.

17:15.098 --> 17:16.863
What?

17:18.007 --> 17:21.097
He used a drawstring
to steady his shot.

17:21.132 --> 17:26.530
I've seen it before in the field manual
for the Green Berets, Special Forces.

17:26.565 --> 17:29.967
It's possible. - Captain, could you
grab this? It'll just take a minute.

17:30.002 --> 17:33.186
- Hold this up like a rifle.
- Right.

17:35.669 --> 17:37.120
- How tall are you?
- Six foot.

17:37.155 --> 17:39.243
- No, really.
- 5'11';

17:39.486 --> 17:44.065
Our guy was taller... 6'3",
maybe 6'4", just like Santa Clara.

17:44.123 --> 17:45.518
Just like what?

17:45.553 --> 17:48.668
The homicide in Santa Clara.
We've been consulting on it.

17:48.703 --> 17:51.529
I read about that.
It's a completely different M. O.

17:51.564 --> 17:55.219
You think there's a connection
because this guy might be tall?

17:55.576 --> 17:57.341
Lieutenant,
get the Warriors on the line.

17:57.376 --> 18:01.497
I want to talk to Antawn Jamison, see if
he's got an alibi for Thursday morning.

18:01.532 --> 18:04.364
Captain, do you know
the percentage of men over 6'3"?

18:04.399 --> 18:07.300
- No. Do you?
- Maybe 0.5.

18:07.335 --> 18:10.135
The odds of two men
in this city in that category,

18:10.170 --> 18:15.043
committing premeditated murder within
two days of each other are astronomical.

18:15.078 --> 18:17.493
All because of
a twisted venetianblind cord.

18:17.528 --> 18:19.529
Monk, that's a stretch, even for you.

18:19.564 --> 18:21.690
That and he wore slippers.

18:23.614 --> 18:25.767
And he smokes Newports.

18:27.386 --> 18:30.122
This isn't police work.
This... This is vaudeville.

18:30.350 --> 18:32.433
He's already killed two...

18:33.938 --> 18:35.346
Two.

18:39.822 --> 18:42.933
Oh, it's nothing. He just has
a little problem with heights.

18:45.572 --> 18:49.786
Okay, we just gotta find an open computer,
and then I can check up the name.

18:49.912 --> 18:51.578
Oh, right here. Yes.

18:55.856 --> 18:58.495
- VAS...
- QUES...

18:58.530 --> 18:59.718
Nicole Vasques.

18:59.753 --> 19:01.211
I don't know her,
but that doesn't mean anything.

19:01.246 --> 19:03.429
I've only been here a couple days.

19:03.464 --> 19:04.908
But let's see.

19:06.078 --> 19:08.295
Well, she's not a volunteer.

19:08.391 --> 19:11.237
And she's not on staff. Sorry.

19:11.352 --> 19:12.865
- What's your name?
- Jake.

19:12.900 --> 19:16.542
Jake, my name's Adrian Monk.
Here's my card.

19:16.577 --> 19:18.529
If you think of anything,
you give me a call.

19:18.564 --> 19:20.585
Okay, sure. Well...

19:26.725 --> 19:32.206
What does a man say about a friend
who took a bullet that was meant for him?

19:32.664 --> 19:38.363
Mere words like
"thank you" seem so hollow.

19:38.945 --> 19:42.459
When I heard
Jason had passed...

19:42.494 --> 19:45.633
This guy is too
good to be true.

19:45.668 --> 19:48.785
Maybe he's a decent man.
Isn't that possible?

19:48.837 --> 19:52.816
And then, I talked to Risa,
Jason's mother,

19:52.851 --> 19:56.669
and she reminded
me her son was no quitter.

19:56.704 --> 19:58.541
You know what I think?

19:58.576 --> 20:01.289
- I think he did it.
- Who?

20:01.324 --> 20:02.706
St. Claire.

20:03.208 --> 20:05.850
- You can't buy this kind of publicity.
- Right. Right.

20:05.885 --> 20:09.130
See it through,
or why begin at all.

20:09.165 --> 20:10.819
Well, what do you think?

20:11.172 --> 20:15.364
I think this case and
the girl in Santa Clara...

20:15.482 --> 20:17.898
are connected somehow.

20:18.884 --> 20:20.958
So who?

20:21.969 --> 20:25.189
Someone who knew them both.

20:25.947 --> 20:28.430
Someone, uh...

20:28.618 --> 20:29.840
What are you doing?

20:29.875 --> 20:32.375
Do you have my keys?
I can't find my keys.

20:32.614 --> 20:33.890
- I don't have your keys.
- Why?

20:33.925 --> 20:36.170
- Adrian, calm down.
- Did you put them in your bag?

20:36.205 --> 20:38.759
No, I don't touch your keys, 'cause
if I touch your keys, you'd freak out.

20:38.794 --> 20:40.279
Calm down!

20:40.314 --> 20:43.580
John Donne said,
"The democracy of death..."

20:43.615 --> 20:46.044
Adrian, just stop it.
Just a second.

20:46.515 --> 20:49.705
Everyone who knew Jason
remembers him and loves him.

20:49.740 --> 20:52.765
Let's remember Jason as he was.

20:53.765 --> 20:55.129
I got them.

20:55.164 --> 20:58.539
Okay. I got them right here.

20:58.785 --> 21:02.053
Okay. Such a relief, you know?

21:13.571 --> 21:17.185
In a few seconds,
we will be closing the casket...

21:17.220 --> 21:20.595
and saying goodbye
to Jason forever.

21:20.630 --> 21:22.397
Adrian, it's okay.
We'll make new ones.

21:22.432 --> 21:23.608
Just... It's okay.

21:23.643 --> 21:25.697
It's the key chain.

21:25.732 --> 21:27.279
The key chain...
it was Trudy's.

21:27.314 --> 21:29.754
I gotta... I gotta...

21:29.789 --> 21:33.163
I gotta have those keys.
That packet right there...

21:33.198 --> 21:34.900
- Just give it to me.
- No.

21:38.995 --> 21:42.337
- You are going straight to hell.
- I am in hell.

21:42.509 --> 21:45.774
May his loving spirit live forever...

21:45.809 --> 21:48.380
in our hearts and in our prayers.

22:01.437 --> 22:07.543
Why don't we take a moment
and meditate silently?

22:22.205 --> 22:26.567
Now... old friend...

22:26.719 --> 22:31.346
we turn and salute
you one last time.

22:41.890 --> 22:43.989
We gotta pull the car around.
He's ready to go.

22:44.990 --> 22:47.616
You should be
ashamed of yourself!

22:47.926 --> 22:51.868
Do you lie awake at night thinking of ways
to disrupt my husband's campaign?

22:51.903 --> 22:53.060
Now, Miranda...

22:53.095 --> 22:55.736
No, ma'am,
I try not to think at all.

22:55.771 --> 22:57.025
These things happen.

22:57.060 --> 23:00.058
Hell, for a minute, I thought
I had a new campaign slogan:

23:00.093 --> 23:02.766
"Vote for St. Claire.
He can raise the dead."

23:03.497 --> 23:05.188
- Where's my boy?
- Here, sir.

23:05.223 --> 23:07.896
- Make sure Miranda gets home.
- Of course.

23:08.611 --> 23:10.664
Mrs. St. Claire,
a couple of questions.

23:10.699 --> 23:12.802
Let me ask you a question.

23:12.837 --> 23:16.088
How can you investigate anything?

23:16.123 --> 23:18.878
I'm told you're "germophobic,"
afraid of the dark,

23:18.913 --> 23:21.983
heights, crowds... and milk.

23:22.018 --> 23:25.523
We're working on the milk.
He's making good progress on milk.

23:27.409 --> 23:30.781
Mrs. St. Claire, ll sense
that you're a little upset,

23:30.816 --> 23:33.240
but I can tell you
why I dropped my keys.

23:33.275 --> 23:35.852
I've been a bit preoccupied
with another case.

23:35.887 --> 23:38.239
A girl was murdered in Santa Clara.

23:38.274 --> 23:41.453
A Nicole Vasques.
Did you know her?

23:41.488 --> 23:42.528
No.

23:42.563 --> 23:43.405
No? - No.

23:43.440 --> 23:47.662
Sir, did you know her...
uh, Nicole Vasques?

23:47.697 --> 23:48.972
Uh, no.

23:49.007 --> 23:50.173
Should I?

23:50.208 --> 23:53.456
- No. No reason you should.
- Excuse me. Jesse.

23:53.491 --> 23:57.041
Ma'am, if you could take
another look. Nicole Vasques.

23:57.076 --> 24:00.277
I don't know anyone
by that name.

24:00.457 --> 24:05.954
What I do know is
if my husband is elected mayor,

24:05.989 --> 24:08.550
you will never work
in this town again.

24:08.828 --> 24:10.369
Let's go.

24:15.742 --> 24:17.135
Are you registered to vote?

24:17.170 --> 24:20.509
I never vote.
It only encourages them.

24:21.041 --> 24:23.617
Let's get out of here.
She makes me sick.

24:23.652 --> 24:25.291
Do you know how much
her husband's worth?

24:25.326 --> 24:27.998
- No.
- $150 million.

24:28.033 --> 24:29.899
Here. - They were talking
about it on the radio.

24:29.934 --> 24:32.472
- That's a lot of motive.
- Yes, it is.

24:50.280 --> 24:53.233
Miranda St. Claire called
the mayor personally.

24:53.268 --> 24:54.944
You couldn't just
buy another key chain?

24:54.979 --> 24:57.864
Trudy gave it to him.
It's irreplaceable.

24:57.899 --> 25:01.091
Captain, wejust got
the forensic report back.

25:01.126 --> 25:04.228
The bullets were hollow point,
designed to deform on impact.

25:04.263 --> 25:05.610
Those can't be traced.

25:05.645 --> 25:08.558
Yeah, but we caught a lucky break.
One was still intact.

25:08.593 --> 25:10.895
They I. D.'d the weapon.
It's a Weatherby Fibermark rifle,

25:10.930 --> 25:13.832
- which is British...
- It's British.

25:13.867 --> 25:17.201
Longrange, preferred by
mercenaries and paramilitary groups.

25:17.236 --> 25:18.862
That's right. He's right.

25:18.897 --> 25:22.025
Well, start a list of weapons
and/or ammunitions sales.

25:22.060 --> 25:23.023
Yes, sir.

25:23.058 --> 25:25.930
Could you crosscheck
that against Nicole Vasques?

25:25.965 --> 25:28.330
- Who?
- The homicide in Santa Clara.

25:28.365 --> 25:31.926
- Sir, your 10:00?
- The cases don't overlap, Monk.

25:31.961 --> 25:34.637
She worked for the DMV.
He was a candidate for mayor.

25:34.672 --> 25:38.078
She was behind on her rent,
he has houses all over the world.

25:38.113 --> 25:40.582
She was stabbed.
He was shot.

25:40.617 --> 25:42.240
Let it go.

25:42.742 --> 25:45.008
- Are we gonna let it go?
- Hell, no.

25:45.043 --> 25:47.637
- What are we gonna do now?
- We're gonna follow the money.

25:48.846 --> 25:51.124
I've always wanted to say that.

25:52.612 --> 25:55.461
"The queen said to the royal doctor,"

25:55.496 --> 25:58.304
"'I'm so worried about the princess."

25:58.339 --> 26:02.806
"'She has all the emeralds and
rubies and riches in the kingdom"

26:02.841 --> 26:04.915
"but she never laughs."

26:04.950 --> 26:09.543
"Who can make the princess laugh?"
"So they called the courtjester."

26:09.578 --> 26:12.552
"The court jester,
as everyone knew,"

26:12.587 --> 26:17.472
"was the silliest and funniest
courtjester that ever there was."

26:17.507 --> 26:21.453
"With a jingle and a jangle,
he rolled into the court."

26:21.488 --> 26:26.118
"'My queen calls,
he sang out as he bowed."

26:26.153 --> 26:30.429
"Jester, 'said the queen,
'the princess has forgotten how to laugh,"

26:30.464 --> 26:35.253
"'and I am giving you thejob of
bringing back her smiles to this court."

26:35.288 --> 26:38.217
"'When shall I start?' He asked.

26:38.708 --> 26:43.243
'Just then, the princess entered
the court, and everyone fell silent.

26:43.278 --> 26:46.861
"'Now is as good
a time as any, 'she said."

26:48.237 --> 26:53.583
"The jester turned and greeted the princess,
and he bowed, he rolled end over end,"

26:53.618 --> 26:57.326
"and when he stopped,
flowers appeared in his..."

27:00.016 --> 27:02.946
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm better.

27:04.358 --> 27:05.972
- Where is she?
- I don't know.

27:06.007 --> 27:08.359
Just give me a moment, please.

27:08.394 --> 27:09.860
There she is.

27:11.867 --> 27:13.915
Hey, you're great with the kids.

27:13.950 --> 27:17.492
Yeah, well, it's easy when
you don't have any of your own.

27:17.944 --> 27:21.516
Let's get this over with.
I have a fundraiser in Denver tonight.

27:21.551 --> 27:26.204
Sure. Sure. I, uh, only have...
a couple of questions, Mrs. St. Claire.

27:26.239 --> 27:30.385
Just basic...
background stuff...

27:32.293 --> 27:33.853
really.

27:34.982 --> 27:38.287
Uh, do you have any bank
accounts in your own name?

27:38.322 --> 27:39.754
No.

27:39.789 --> 27:42.002
Do you wanna maybe
take some notes here?

27:42.037 --> 27:43.282
No, I'll remember it.

27:43.317 --> 27:45.159
Yeah, it's probably
better to write it down.

27:45.194 --> 27:46.587
You don't think
I can remember?

27:46.622 --> 27:50.519
How long have you, uh,
and Warren been married?

27:50.554 --> 27:52.624
- Five years.
- Must be tough.

27:52.659 --> 27:56.430
He's so busy, and now
he's running for mayor.

27:56.465 --> 27:59.731
I would think that would
be kind of... kind of stressful.

28:00.836 --> 28:03.017
You've been married, right?

28:03.377 --> 28:05.781
Yes, uh, I have.

28:05.816 --> 28:10.476
Then I don't have to tell
you every marriage is stressful.

28:10.511 --> 28:12.169
That's why they call it "marriage."

28:12.204 --> 28:14.076
Is there anything else?

28:14.148 --> 28:16.570
Yeah. Are you, uh,

28:16.605 --> 28:19.151
are you going to be
seeing Mr. Goodman later?

28:19.186 --> 28:21.674
- Jesse?
- Jesse.

28:21.997 --> 28:24.376
Why do you ask?

28:24.978 --> 28:29.048
Well, if you see him, you know, uh,

28:29.083 --> 28:33.438
just... would you tell him to call me?
Because I just... I'd love to talk to him.

28:33.473 --> 28:37.224
And, you know, if you see him.

28:37.259 --> 28:40.652
Are you accusing me
of something, Mr. Monk?

28:41.286 --> 28:45.072
I don't know.
Are you guilty of something?

28:49.215 --> 28:50.709
Mr. Monk.

28:50.744 --> 28:54.128
You seem like
an intelligent person.

28:55.185 --> 28:57.211
On occasion.

28:58.040 --> 29:02.616
Warren is the first man in
my life that never gave up on me.

29:02.651 --> 29:07.006
Last week, if I could have,
I would have taken that bullet myself.

29:08.798 --> 29:10.456
You have to believe me.

29:10.491 --> 29:12.764
Mrs. St. Claire,

29:12.799 --> 29:16.183
I have to listen to you.
I don't have to believe you.

29:16.218 --> 29:18.443
I'm leaving now.

29:21.528 --> 29:24.141
There's no doubt in
my mind that witch did it.

29:24.176 --> 29:26.267
Hello?

29:26.392 --> 29:28.429
Adrian, it's for you. Okay?

29:28.464 --> 29:29.629
Yeah, this is Monk.

29:29.664 --> 29:32.007
Mr. Monk, it's Jake
from the St. Claire campaign.

29:32.042 --> 29:33.358
I think I found something.

29:33.393 --> 29:35.943
- I'll be right there.
- Actually, I was about to leave.

29:35.978 --> 29:38.292
I can drop it off.
I'll be there in a halfhour.

29:38.327 --> 29:41.852
- Good. I'll meet you there.
- That a personal call?

29:41.936 --> 29:44.723
- I may be a little late.
- All right, my beautiful people,

29:44.758 --> 29:46.735
I love every one of you, but these

29:46.736 --> 29:49.468
envelopes will not get
stuffed by themselves.

29:59.907 --> 30:02.079
No, no, no, no.
No, no, no, no!

30:02.114 --> 30:03.025
No, thanks.
No, not today!

30:03.060 --> 30:05.074
Come on, I just cleaned it!
Come on!

30:06.044 --> 30:07.964
All right. Fine, fine.

30:10.545 --> 30:12.307
That's fine.

30:28.166 --> 30:29.547
Hey, Captain.

30:30.896 --> 30:34.214
Captain. Captain,

30:34.249 --> 30:36.126
we got the preliminary.

30:36.161 --> 30:39.451
Probable accident...
severe blunt trauma to the head.

30:40.491 --> 30:42.629
- Okay.
- Captain?

30:42.750 --> 30:44.368
Captain?

30:44.403 --> 30:48.436
Are there any documents
in the car, like a notebook?

30:49.332 --> 30:51.221
No.

30:55.154 --> 30:57.015
- Captain?
- What?

30:57.050 --> 30:59.294
- Check his hat.
- What?

30:59.329 --> 31:01.921
He used to carry things in his hat.

31:01.956 --> 31:04.226
Was there a hat?
They didn't pull anything.

31:04.261 --> 31:06.609
He wasn't wearing a hat!

31:07.674 --> 31:08.672
What are you doing?

31:08.707 --> 31:11.757
Come on down.
The accident scene's down here.

31:16.670 --> 31:20.387
He's not wearing
the right shoes today.

31:22.657 --> 31:25.085
Not wearing the right shoes today.

31:25.154 --> 31:27.622
Look, there's nothing to do here.

31:28.128 --> 31:31.240
The port authority's calling it.
It's a singlecar accident.

31:31.275 --> 31:33.866
No, no. No, this was no accident.

31:33.901 --> 31:35.797
There's no skid marks on the road.

31:35.832 --> 31:37.710
It's wet!

31:38.413 --> 31:42.198
You're not the only detective here, Monk.
I checked for skid marks.

31:42.233 --> 31:44.331
It happens all the time on this hill.

31:44.366 --> 31:46.870
You hit this curve at 85, 90 miles an hour.

31:46.905 --> 31:48.217
Ftt! Boom!

31:48.252 --> 31:52.012
No. No, this was staged.
He was killed somewhere else.

31:52.047 --> 31:54.064
Maybe you could tell me
where this murder took place.

31:54.099 --> 31:55.543
That would be very helpful.

31:55.578 --> 31:58.233
Cole Avenue and 17 th Street.

32:02.150 --> 32:05.162
How could you possibly know that?
We were meeting at my house.

32:05.197 --> 32:07.010
He probably took Cole.

32:07.045 --> 32:09.892
I'm thinking he was killed
at that stop sign on 17 th Street.

32:09.927 --> 32:11.259
Why 17th?

32:11.294 --> 32:15.326
There's a homeless shelter there.
They wash windshields for spare change.

32:15.361 --> 32:17.822
I'm thinking somebody
approached the car,

32:17.857 --> 32:21.520
started washing the window
and then attacked him.

32:21.660 --> 32:23.956
You can see the windshield
even better from here.

32:23.991 --> 32:27.630
The driver's side's clean.
The passenger side's filthy.

32:29.507 --> 32:31.470
Go check the windshield.

32:35.672 --> 32:37.552
Go, Adrian.

32:37.930 --> 32:39.924
Excuse me, Officer.

32:40.678 --> 32:42.464
Son of a bitch.

32:42.741 --> 32:46.401
Adrian, this officer is
gonna drive you home, okay?

32:46.523 --> 32:48.155
Thank you.

32:48.190 --> 32:50.027
Behave yourself!
He's armed.

32:50.062 --> 32:51.566
Why? Where you going?

32:51.601 --> 32:53.416
I have a date.
I told you about it.

32:53.451 --> 32:55.779
Oh, I thought you were joking.

32:56.834 --> 32:59.070
You thought I was joking?

32:59.105 --> 33:01.161
Why? You don't think
I could possibly have a date?

33:01.196 --> 33:04.238
- No, I didn't mean that.
- What is so funny about me dating, Adrian?

33:04.273 --> 33:06.465
Nothing. Sorry.

33:06.500 --> 33:09.051
It's just... It's Tuesday.

33:13.226 --> 33:15.521
It's chicken potpie night.

33:15.840 --> 33:17.001
Don't be such a baby.

33:17.036 --> 33:19.297
My 11 yearold kid can
bake a chicken potpie.

33:19.332 --> 33:20.969
I'll see you later, okay?

33:21.931 --> 33:23.742
Okay. Okay. Slow down.

33:23.777 --> 33:25.699
Slow down one second.

33:25.734 --> 33:29.836
All right, then you said
2/3 of a cup... 2/3...

33:29.871 --> 33:31.373
Who are you on the phone with?

33:31.408 --> 33:33.433
- No one.
- Give me the phone.

33:33.877 --> 33:35.904
Monk, is that you?

33:35.939 --> 33:37.557
Okay, I'm hanging up now.
And don't call back.

33:37.592 --> 33:39.086
Benjy's got homework. Lots of it.

33:39.121 --> 33:41.894
Don't hang up. No!
Benjy, call me back!

33:42.266 --> 33:44.156
He sounds certifiable.

33:44.191 --> 33:47.771
- It's the worst job I ever had.
- Yeah? So why don't you quit?

33:47.806 --> 33:51.732
Well, because it's also
the best job I ever had.

33:51.767 --> 33:53.435
I'm having adventures.

33:53.470 --> 33:56.152
I can't believe it. I'm putting
bad guys behind bars.

33:56.187 --> 33:59.020
I feel like, um...
What is her name?

33:59.055 --> 34:00.972
Superman's girlfriend.

34:01.007 --> 34:02.250
Oh, Lois Lane.

34:02.285 --> 34:03.895
- I'm Lois Lane.
- Yeah.

34:03.930 --> 34:07.374
I mean, how many practical
nurses can say that? Not many.

34:10.342 --> 34:12.580
You see, that looks so fine on you.

34:12.614 --> 34:14.264
What, the dress?

34:14.299 --> 34:16.234
The smile.

34:19.176 --> 34:21.393
Thank you.

34:22.512 --> 34:25.661
Five... six...

34:26.572 --> 34:29.646
Seven... eight...

34:30.489 --> 34:33.873
nine... ten.

34:33.908 --> 34:36.804
We have some new footage of
the event that was taken by a tourist.

34:36.840 --> 34:40.637
I should warn you,
some of this is very graphic.

34:40.672 --> 34:42.984
Make way for the mayor!

34:47.556 --> 34:51.505
To moderation in all things, hmm?

34:51.614 --> 34:53.275
Except love.

34:55.967 --> 34:57.146
Hey.

34:59.448 --> 35:01.493
Monk, what are
you doing here?

35:01.528 --> 35:03.307
I was watching the news.

35:03.342 --> 35:05.556
There was a videotape
of the St. Claire thing.

35:05.591 --> 35:08.823
Something about it
just does not add up.

35:09.700 --> 35:11.844
Mr. Monk, I presume?

35:11.879 --> 35:14.275
You must be Carl
from the health club.

35:18.539 --> 35:21.717
Well, uh, why don't
you join us?

35:21.752 --> 35:24.906
No, he shouldn't. You know,
two's company, three's a crowd,

35:24.941 --> 35:29.111
and Monk hates crowds, don't you?

35:29.225 --> 35:31.682
I feel okay when you're around.

35:40.023 --> 35:43.723
Boy, this is nice, isn't it?

35:45.530 --> 35:48.471
I forgot. What were
we talking about?

35:48.506 --> 35:50.490
- England.
- Oh, my God, that's right.

35:50.525 --> 35:55.310
Um, Carl said that, uh,
he was talking about living in England.

35:55.345 --> 35:58.387
- He was a Rhodes Scholar.
- No kidding!

35:58.422 --> 36:01.641
Yeah. He graduated
magna cum laude.

36:01.676 --> 36:05.452
- Cum laud.
- Right. I know.

36:05.487 --> 36:09.154
And now he has a private practice.
He's an entertainment lawyer.

36:09.189 --> 36:11.527
Guess who he represents.
Can I tell him?

36:11.562 --> 36:13.236
Yeah, sure.

36:13.271 --> 36:16.400
Francis Ford Coppola.

36:16.514 --> 36:18.461
Yeah, but it's no big deal.

36:18.496 --> 36:22.832
A tabloid wrote something about him...
that, you know, he was drunk at the Oscars,

36:22.867 --> 36:25.135
so now we're suing them for slander.

36:29.048 --> 36:32.570
I don't know what to do here.

36:33.653 --> 36:35.541
I'm no good at this.

36:35.856 --> 36:39.273
Okay. This man is lying to you.

36:39.348 --> 36:41.098
He's not a lawyer.

36:41.133 --> 36:42.538
What?

36:42.573 --> 36:44.499
Oxford doesn't have
a magna cum laud,

36:44.534 --> 36:48.497
and you sue a newspaper
for libel, not slander.

36:52.800 --> 36:54.570
I'll just shut up.

36:54.605 --> 36:57.684
Forget I said anything.
It's no big deal, Carl.

36:59.694 --> 37:03.393
Well, that looks...

37:03.522 --> 37:05.496
What the hell is that?

37:05.647 --> 37:08.641
What should I have done?
Just let him lie to you?

37:08.676 --> 37:12.352
Yes. Yes. It was a first date. Taxi!

37:12.992 --> 37:14.975
Everybody embellishes their resume.

37:15.010 --> 37:18.148
It's called "human nature."
Do you think I told him about Benjy?

37:18.183 --> 37:21.625
About that summer I spent
dancing in Atlantic City? No.

37:21.660 --> 37:23.877
What kind of dancing?

37:25.300 --> 37:27.356
I can't do this anymore.

37:27.391 --> 37:28.577
- I quit.
- Not again.

37:28.612 --> 37:31.143
No. No.
I mean it this time.

37:31.178 --> 37:35.200
- I'm sending my sister over for my stuff.
- You know you're just gonna come back.

37:35.235 --> 37:37.871
Don't tell me what I'm gonna do.

37:37.906 --> 37:39.209
You think you know everything?

37:39.244 --> 37:41.235
Believe it or not,
you don't know me that well.

37:41.270 --> 37:42.772
All right.
Let's just go back inside.

37:42.807 --> 37:47.470
No. No. It's too late.

37:52.210 --> 37:53.898
Look...

37:53.933 --> 37:56.424
I have responsibilities now.

37:56.459 --> 37:58.847
I got a kid.

37:59.262 --> 38:04.411
And I think I have to find a normal job...
before I go completely crazy.

38:04.673 --> 38:06.617
Like me.

38:08.499 --> 38:10.509
Like me?

38:14.452 --> 38:16.505
Well,

38:17.525 --> 38:20.416
I'll never forget you.

38:21.120 --> 38:23.601
You never forget anything.

38:23.837 --> 38:25.726
Valencia and 28th.

40:07.280 --> 40:10.082
Okay, make me happy.

40:10.224 --> 40:14.800
We found it wedged under
the passenger seat, uh, in his hat.

40:19.812 --> 40:21.972
- Third name from...
- I see it, I see it.

40:22.007 --> 40:23.649
She was a parttime volunteer.

40:23.684 --> 40:26.164
She quit two months ago.
That's why her name didn't come up.

40:31.506 --> 40:33.575
So Monk was right.

40:33.610 --> 40:35.604
There is a connection.

40:35.639 --> 40:37.165
How does he do it?

40:37.200 --> 40:41.581
I mean, I have two eyes.
I see everything that he sees, but I...

40:41.834 --> 40:44.429
I don't see what he sees.

40:44.921 --> 40:47.274
Sir, if I may,

40:47.309 --> 40:50.718
what Monk does,
it's a parlor trick.

40:50.753 --> 40:52.912
I mean, can he do all this?

40:52.947 --> 40:56.703
Can he organize a citywide
investigation, inspire the troops,

40:56.738 --> 40:58.790
motivate people?

40:58.825 --> 41:01.620
Adrian Monk isn't half the cop...

41:01.655 --> 41:04.538
or a third of the man that you are, sir.

41:04.573 --> 41:08.488
Thank you, Lieutenant.
Nonetheless...

41:08.686 --> 41:10.422
we need him now.

41:10.457 --> 41:11.913
Go get him.

41:13.232 --> 41:15.030
He's not home.

41:17.234 --> 41:19.371
Well, then he's at Sharona's.
Call Sharona.

41:19.406 --> 41:21.773
I tried her.
She said she quit.

41:21.808 --> 41:23.859
Sharona quit?

41:23.894 --> 41:26.050
You mean Monk's alone?

41:26.765 --> 41:28.715
Out there in public?

41:33.013 --> 41:35.103
Hello? Are you Benjy?

41:35.138 --> 41:38.731
- Yeah. Who are you?
- I'm Sheldon Burger, Deputy Mayor.

41:38.766 --> 41:40.829
Hey, you like skateboarding?

41:40.864 --> 41:44.544
Mom, something
happened to Monk!

41:45.226 --> 41:46.314
Forget it.

41:46.349 --> 41:48.133
Monk's been one step
ahead of us all the way,

41:48.168 --> 41:49.940
but the man can't
function without you.

41:50.628 --> 41:53.821
The city of San Francisco
would be eternally grateful.

41:56.085 --> 41:58.173
These are really good.
Did you make these?

41:58.208 --> 42:00.143
They're Oreos, Sheldon.

42:00.178 --> 42:03.807
- They are?
- They say "Oreos"on them.

42:04.578 --> 42:05.735
Oh, yeah.

42:05.770 --> 42:08.199
Exactly how eternally
grateful would the city be?

42:08.234 --> 42:09.968
You tell us, Sharona.

42:10.003 --> 42:12.647
- Whatever you want.
- A skateboard track.

42:12.682 --> 42:16.773
Mom, make them build
a skateboard track in the park.

42:17.000 --> 42:18.681
Okay.

42:18.716 --> 42:20.714
Here's the deal.

42:21.872 --> 42:26.025
I'll find Monk and bring him back,
and you'll owe me one.

42:26.060 --> 42:28.035
- One what?
- Someday...

42:28.070 --> 42:29.752
there'll be a knock on your door.

42:29.787 --> 42:34.458
Whatever I say, whatever I want,
you'll have to say yes.

42:34.493 --> 42:36.453
Within reason.

42:36.488 --> 42:40.209
- Then forget it.
- Okay, okay, okay, not within reason.

43:20.610 --> 43:22.794
That was our song.

43:22.829 --> 43:25.340
I'm sure she heard you.

43:25.975 --> 43:29.579
I don't see how.
She's been dead for four years.

43:30.944 --> 43:33.089
Welcome back.

43:34.250 --> 43:37.033
Well, don't pretend
you're surprised.

43:38.752 --> 43:42.422
You know, you were right
about the cases being connected.

43:43.116 --> 43:48.072
Nicole Vasques did volunteer work
for the St. Claire campaign.

43:48.229 --> 43:51.015
How does it feel,
always being right?

43:51.050 --> 43:52.851
Terrible.

43:52.886 --> 43:54.768
Come on. Let's go.

43:57.707 --> 44:00.560
I don't know if I'm gonna
be able to pull this off.

44:00.595 --> 44:03.028
Adrian, you're gonna be fine.

44:05.136 --> 44:09.331
So, are you ever gonna tell me what
kind of dancing you did in Atlantic City?

44:09.853 --> 44:12.000
Ballroom.

44:12.035 --> 44:13.811
Really?

44:14.995 --> 44:17.506
Campaign volunteer.

44:17.541 --> 44:20.219
Campaign volunteer.
What did she do there?

44:20.254 --> 44:22.813
Oh, this and that.
Mostly helping the bookkeeper.

44:22.848 --> 44:26.831
She quit after seven weeks,
which, I'm told, is not unusual.

44:28.116 --> 44:29.802
Pretty small crowd.

44:29.837 --> 44:32.666
How many times you
need to watch that, Adrian?

44:32.831 --> 44:35.004
We're missing
The Price Is Right.

44:35.039 --> 44:36.357
The rally.

44:36.392 --> 44:39.349
I mean, why would
Gavin Lloyd set it there?

44:39.384 --> 44:42.229
A weekday in the middle
of the financial district.

44:42.264 --> 44:44.671
They were just talking
about Gavin Lloyd on the radio.

44:44.706 --> 44:48.982
Apparently, he was this
hotshot political genius,

44:49.017 --> 44:51.458
and now the national parties
won't even touch him.

44:51.493 --> 44:52.388
Why not?

44:52.423 --> 44:54.757
Well, he was never
officially charged,

44:54.792 --> 44:59.216
but the word is some campaign
contributions Gavin collected...

44:59.251 --> 45:01.253
were there one minute
and gone the next.

45:01.288 --> 45:06.160
Oh, right. That was a senate race,
right, in North Carolina?

45:07.194 --> 45:09.581
Adrian, what are you doing?

45:10.333 --> 45:11.858
It was dented.

45:15.904 --> 45:18.332
Where? You can't even see it.

45:18.367 --> 45:20.856
I am what I am.
Do you want it?

45:20.891 --> 45:24.038
Of course I want it.
I'm not the mental case.

45:31.706 --> 45:33.373
Oh, look...
this one's dented, too.

45:33.408 --> 45:35.152
- That's funny.
- I know.

45:35.187 --> 45:37.492
I don't know why you
shop at that place, Adrian.

45:45.607 --> 45:47.236
105.

45:48.888 --> 45:51.275
106.

45:51.511 --> 45:53.633
107, 108.

45:53.905 --> 45:55.410
109.

45:59.916 --> 46:01.652
110.

46:15.180 --> 46:18.022
132, 133, 134.

46:53.000 --> 46:55.288
You should've seen me.
I had the moves.

46:55.323 --> 46:57.930
I was diving,
I was running out of the way.

46:57.965 --> 46:59.041
That's great, Adrian.

46:59.076 --> 47:01.083
Don't you get it?
It means we're getting close.

47:01.118 --> 47:03.500
- We're making somebody nervous.
- I just can't picture outrunning a car.

47:03.535 --> 47:05.249
I wasn't even
running my fastest.

47:05.284 --> 47:07.419
- Why not?
- You know.

47:07.454 --> 47:08.846
Were you touching
all the poles again?

47:08.881 --> 47:10.431
I always touch the poles.

47:10.466 --> 47:11.897
Adrian Monk for Gavin Lloyd.

47:11.932 --> 47:14.203
- How old was she?
- 25.

47:14.238 --> 47:15.969
It's heartbreaking.

47:16.098 --> 47:18.053
She worked for Flo,
your bookkeeper.

47:18.088 --> 47:20.890
She was here last summer
for about seven weeks.

47:20.925 --> 47:23.731
We get kids like this all the time.
Every campaign does.

47:23.766 --> 47:24.827
We call them floaters.

47:24.862 --> 47:27.088
Their boyfriend comes back,
they get a new job...

47:27.123 --> 47:28.096
fft!... they're gone.

47:28.131 --> 47:31.666
So, Flo said that you
took Nicole aside one day.

47:31.701 --> 47:35.268
I did? - Yes, this would've
been lastJuly sometime.

47:35.303 --> 47:39.374
And you talked to her for a while,
and then she never came back to work.

47:39.409 --> 47:42.433
I talk to 100 kids every day,
you know, more.

47:42.468 --> 47:46.086
We, uh, actually, as a matter of fact,
we lost another one last week...

47:46.121 --> 47:47.884
car crash in Sausalito.

47:48.515 --> 47:51.310
Yeah.
We heard about that.

47:52.220 --> 47:53.834
See, I'm sorry.

47:53.869 --> 47:57.932
LI don't pretend to know
much about politics.

47:57.967 --> 48:01.657
Vote for, uh, Warren St. Claire.
That's all you need to know.

48:02.654 --> 48:07.353
But what was the reason
you held the rally at that plaza?

48:07.388 --> 48:10.452
Heart of the financial district. We wanted
to assure the business community...

48:10.487 --> 48:14.422
that Warren St. Claire is on
their side, and it's working.

48:14.457 --> 48:16.429
Have you seen
the latest poll numbers?

48:16.464 --> 48:19.204
Yes. Congratulations.

48:19.239 --> 48:20.718
Thank you.

48:21.530 --> 48:23.940
Chicago.

48:27.438 --> 48:30.342
That's a confidential
document. - Sorry.

48:30.377 --> 48:35.424
- That's why we shredded it.
- Sorry. - That's okay.

48:37.301 --> 48:39.370
I have a suggestion, Mr. Monk.

48:39.405 --> 48:41.127
I'm gonna do my job,

48:41.162 --> 48:43.637
she'll do her job,
he'll do his job,

48:43.672 --> 48:47.623
and you, sir, you and Miss...

48:48.114 --> 48:53.140
Fleming. - Fleming,
go out and do your job.

48:53.305 --> 48:56.332
Thanks. Good luck.
Okay. Thank you.

48:58.730 --> 49:00.571
Mr. Monk, sorry
to keep you waiting.

49:00.606 --> 49:01.789
That's okay.

49:03.040 --> 49:06.810
You know, Mr. Goodman,
your painting is very, um...

49:07.142 --> 49:08.633
I can't think of the word. It's...

49:08.668 --> 49:09.812
Scary?

49:09.847 --> 49:13.055
I just got that piece.
Something about it, I just had to have it.

49:13.090 --> 49:15.965
Yeah. - You can tell a lot about
a person from his taste in art.

49:16.000 --> 49:17.130
He did it.

49:17.165 --> 49:19.406
Just a couple of questions, sir.

49:19.523 --> 49:22.187
How long have you
worked for Mr. St. Claire?

49:22.222 --> 49:24.352
Nine years.
I was the first person he hired.

49:24.387 --> 49:26.645
But he never made you partner.

49:27.193 --> 49:30.435
You don't see me complaining.
I'm a lucky man.

49:30.470 --> 49:32.384
I see you've been out of town.

49:32.419 --> 49:35.022
Upstate. My family has
a cabin on Rockaway Lake.

49:35.057 --> 49:36.767
I needed some time
to clear my thoughts.

49:36.802 --> 49:37.997
It's been a hell of a week.

49:38.032 --> 49:41.023
Mr. Goodman,
I'm sure of two things.

49:41.058 --> 49:43.036
One:

49:43.246 --> 49:44.278
Adrian.

49:44.313 --> 49:46.735
One, your cabin is quite lovely.

49:46.770 --> 49:49.391
And, two, you were
nowhere near it.

49:49.426 --> 49:51.262
- What?
- Your wristwatch.

49:51.297 --> 49:54.069
It's set two hours
ahead to central time.

49:54.104 --> 49:57.058
You haven't been north,
you've been east.

49:57.093 --> 50:01.091
Unless I'm wrong,
which, you know, I'm not,

50:01.126 --> 50:02.101
you were in Chicago.

50:02.136 --> 50:03.920
That's crazy.
I don't know anyone in Chicago.

50:03.955 --> 50:05.642
You know Miranda St. Claire.

50:05.677 --> 50:10.321
She told us she was going to Denver,
but her travel itinerary said Chicago.

50:10.356 --> 50:13.818
So what we have here, sir,
are two consenting adults,

50:13.853 --> 50:17.479
both lying about
where they spent last night.

50:19.008 --> 50:22.305
What I'm about to say
can't leave this room.

50:26.109 --> 50:28.448
Miranda and I have, uh,

50:28.483 --> 50:30.890
been together twice.

50:30.925 --> 50:32.933
So last night makes three?

50:32.968 --> 50:36.726
No, last night it ended.

50:37.314 --> 50:40.063
I swear I didn't want her.

50:40.253 --> 50:45.197
I wanted to hurt Warren...
the legendary Warren St. Claire.

50:45.232 --> 50:49.289
- I was sick of being his key chain.
- You wanted to hurt him?

50:49.324 --> 50:52.802
No, no, no, I didn't mean...
I wouldn't really hurt him.

50:52.837 --> 50:56.062
Oh, of course not.
You just wanted to hump his wife.

50:56.097 --> 50:58.883
You want to charge me with
something, you call my lawyer.

50:58.918 --> 51:00.821
What is this?

51:01.224 --> 51:02.960
What?

51:04.176 --> 51:05.745
It's me, isn't it?

51:05.780 --> 51:08.835
Look, I don't have time
for this, all right?

51:08.870 --> 51:11.214
This meeting is over.

51:16.459 --> 51:17.715
He's gone.

51:18.021 --> 51:19.223
It's me, isn't it?

51:19.258 --> 51:21.385
- Hello?
- Is'nt it?

51:21.420 --> 51:22.763
Okay.

51:22.798 --> 51:23.960
It's me.

51:23.995 --> 51:26.419
Hey, they got him.
We got to go. They got him.

51:27.090 --> 51:29.071
Come on.

51:30.812 --> 51:33.718
The F. B. I. Coughed up
a major file on this guy Ian Sykes.

51:33.753 --> 51:36.016
ExSpecial Forces. Last April,

51:36.051 --> 51:39.219
he purchased a scope for
a Weatherby Fibermark rifle.

51:39.254 --> 51:42.371
You guys stay here
until we're inside, all right?

51:42.406 --> 51:44.499
Did he mention how tall he was?

51:45.643 --> 51:48.319
Yes. He's 6'5" tall.

51:48.688 --> 51:50.089
I got lucky.

52:08.190 --> 52:10.090
- Police! Police!
- Go! Go!

52:10.125 --> 52:11.726
Clear!

52:13.547 --> 52:15.505
Police! Come out!

52:15.540 --> 52:19.179
Slow! Easy!

52:22.059 --> 52:23.979
You alone?

52:25.257 --> 52:28.259
You don't have to
keep apologizing, sir.

52:28.294 --> 52:30.961
Everybody makes mistakes.

52:31.385 --> 52:35.286
The fact is, I was 6'5"...

52:35.786 --> 52:37.352
Once.

52:37.387 --> 52:41.317
You did buy a scope for
a Weatherby Fibermark rifle.

52:41.542 --> 52:44.850
Yes, sir, for my father.

52:45.061 --> 52:47.388
Uh, he hunts alone now.

52:47.423 --> 52:51.270
The Rocky Mountains aren't
exactly handicap accessible.

52:58.159 --> 52:59.825
Sorry.

53:08.430 --> 53:11.720
Okay, boys and girls,
the beat goes on.

53:11.755 --> 53:14.101
We gotta talk to that profiler again.

53:15.125 --> 53:18.838
Call the mayor.
Tell him we're back at square one.

53:21.103 --> 53:22.759
What?

53:24.175 --> 53:26.305
Your shoes.

53:26.483 --> 53:27.538
Yes?

53:27.573 --> 53:31.498
They're all scuffed up, and
they've got little creases in them.

53:31.533 --> 53:33.317
Yeah, my shoes are
scuffed up, Monk.

53:33.352 --> 53:36.757
They're not spotless like yours
because I actually use them.

53:36.847 --> 53:39.512
His were all scuffed up, too.

53:45.691 --> 53:47.804
Call up SWAT.

53:47.839 --> 53:50.847
You go get in your car.
Go. Go, go, go, go, go.

53:50.882 --> 53:52.618
Get him out of here.

53:52.653 --> 53:54.274
Go!

54:04.437 --> 54:06.396
Stottlemeyer said
we'd be safer over here.

54:06.431 --> 54:10.314
That's a crock. He put us in the cheap
seats so he could take all the credit.

54:10.349 --> 54:12.785
Oh, great!
The battery's dead.

54:12.820 --> 54:14.553
Look, I got to check on Benjy.

54:14.588 --> 54:16.161
Stay here and don't move.

54:16.196 --> 54:17.900
I'm gonna find a phone.

54:17.935 --> 54:20.388
- Well, hurry.
- I will. I promise.

54:25.729 --> 54:27.320
Hey!

54:33.238 --> 54:36.040
Hey. Hey!

54:36.075 --> 54:37.571
He's...

54:37.817 --> 54:40.415
Over... Over here!

54:45.769 --> 54:47.386
Hey!

54:48.310 --> 54:51.031
He's here! Hey!
What are you...

55:01.992 --> 55:04.383
Call the... Get...

55:06.687 --> 55:08.335
Come on!

55:23.570 --> 55:25.606
Don't look up.
Don't look down.

55:25.641 --> 55:28.798
Don't look up.
Don't look down.

55:43.115 --> 55:46.700
Don't look up. Don't
look down. Don't look...

55:47.798 --> 55:49.319
Excuse me.

55:51.084 --> 55:52.803
You... You...

55:52.838 --> 55:56.692
You have the...
right to... remain silent.

56:04.000 --> 56:06.309
He actually said, "Excuse me,"
and then he crawled over you?

56:06.344 --> 56:09.157
Well, it was more like
he crawled around me.

56:09.192 --> 56:12.546
- Good work, Detective.
- I don't think he recognized me,

56:12.581 --> 56:16.162
before up in his room
or just now on the fire escape.

56:16.197 --> 56:18.583
- Which means what?
- Which means...

56:18.618 --> 56:22.190
he's not the guy who
tried to run me down.

56:22.225 --> 56:24.133
I think we're looking
for two different guys.

56:24.168 --> 56:26.507
Well, if only we had him in custody,
we could've questioned him.

56:26.542 --> 56:28.717
Let me get this straight.

56:28.752 --> 56:29.853
I'm confused, Monk.

56:29.888 --> 56:32.130
You say you want your
badge back, is that right?

56:32.165 --> 56:36.010
You want your badge back so you can protect
this city from rapists and murderers,

56:36.045 --> 56:39.916
as long as they don't climb any ladders
or run across any big, bad, scary bridges.

56:39.951 --> 56:41.597
- Is that right?
- Give him a break, Captain.

56:41.632 --> 56:43.696
No, you give me a break.

56:43.731 --> 56:45.351
Look, you want to carry a gun?

56:45.386 --> 56:49.213
You're gonna carry a loaded gun
and have other cops depend on you?

56:49.481 --> 56:52.868
No, I don't think so.
You're off the case.

56:53.920 --> 56:55.597
Oh, bite me.

56:55.632 --> 56:57.399
I'm sorry.
What did you say?

56:58.624 --> 56:59.833
What did you say?

56:59.868 --> 57:03.644
This isn't about what
happened today, is it?

57:03.862 --> 57:06.461
This is about you and me.

57:06.496 --> 57:09.909
- This is about you and me.
- No, Monk, this isn't personal.

57:09.944 --> 57:12.596
The fact of the matter is
the mostwanted man in the city...

57:12.631 --> 57:14.648
got away because you got dizzy!

57:15.611 --> 57:17.160
Am I right?

57:18.016 --> 57:21.549
Don't expect the mayor to help you either,
because after this, you're a leper.

57:24.041 --> 57:26.334
What is that, your tough look?

57:36.806 --> 57:39.566
Hey, Mom, what's he doing?

57:39.651 --> 57:42.531
This is where his wife was...

57:42.929 --> 57:46.282
This is where
Mrs. Monk passed away.

57:56.190 --> 57:58.257
- Hey, Monk.
- Hey, Monk.

58:02.758 --> 58:04.837
Benjy, be careful.

58:08.525 --> 58:14.598
She... She must've been
meeting somebody, but who?

58:14.633 --> 58:18.710
Was it a story
she was working on?

58:18.840 --> 58:24.761
I don't know. And I can't see it,
and why can't I see it?

58:28.145 --> 58:30.907
I think you're too close to it, Monk.

58:33.129 --> 58:34.933
Benjy!

58:35.396 --> 58:36.788
Is he okay?

58:36.823 --> 58:39.084
- He's okay.
- Yeah, I'm okay.

58:40.311 --> 58:42.561
How many times have
I told you to be careful?

58:42.596 --> 58:44.279
- How many?
- Don't worry, I'm okay.

58:44.314 --> 58:47.145
You could've killed yourself.
I'll take it away if you don't watch it.

58:47.180 --> 58:48.570
- I'm fine.
- Are you okay?

58:48.605 --> 58:50.723
I'm okay.

58:50.758 --> 58:53.657
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm okay.

58:54.075 --> 58:56.650
- Are you okay?
- I'm okay!

58:57.468 --> 59:00.364
- Did you hear that?
- Yeah, it's an echo.

59:00.399 --> 59:04.301
- You have to get out more.
- Benjy, be careful. - Okay.

59:04.763 --> 59:06.832
What?

59:06.867 --> 59:08.613
What?

59:10.298 --> 59:12.163
I've got it.

59:14.036 --> 59:16.034
You got what?

59:17.613 --> 59:19.450
You know who did it?

59:24.028 --> 59:26.584
You know who tried
to kill St. Claire?

59:26.980 --> 59:29.316
Monk, who did it?

59:29.351 --> 59:31.247
You're not gonna
tell me who did it?

59:31.282 --> 59:33.172
It doesn't matter.

59:33.207 --> 59:36.692
They're not gonna listen to me.
You heard the captain.

59:37.136 --> 59:38.910
I'm a leper.

01:00:01.485 --> 01:00:04.606
- Hi, Sharona.
- Hey, Sheldon.

01:00:05.109 --> 01:00:07.782
- Can I come in?
- Yeah.

01:00:17.599 --> 01:00:19.993
Okay...

01:00:20.028 --> 01:00:23.255
I need everybody to stand
exactly where they were...

01:00:23.290 --> 01:00:25.839
after the shots were fired.

01:00:25.874 --> 01:00:30.842
Mrs. St. Claire,
you were standing right here.

01:00:31.181 --> 01:00:32.384
What is the point?

01:00:32.419 --> 01:00:34.440
We know who tried
to kill my husband.

01:00:34.475 --> 01:00:36.214
It was that lunatic,
what's his name?

01:00:36.249 --> 01:00:39.024
Lan Sykes. - He's probably
halfway to Mexico by now.

01:00:39.059 --> 01:00:41.045
That's true.
Mr. Goodman, if you would.

01:00:41.080 --> 01:00:42.650
That's true,
Ian Sykes got away.

01:00:42.685 --> 01:00:46.433
- Yes, he did.
- And I feel terrible about that,

01:00:46.468 --> 01:00:48.496
but today we're looking
for his accomplice,

01:00:48.531 --> 01:00:51.756
- the person who hired Ian Sykes.
- Are you a poker player, Mr. Monk?

01:00:51.791 --> 01:00:53.571
Because you're either
bluffing your ass off,

01:00:53.606 --> 01:00:55.545
or sitting on a very sweet hand.

01:00:55.580 --> 01:00:58.719
Well, let's find out. Sir, all week long,
I have been racking my brain:

01:00:58.754 --> 01:01:00.413
Who would want to
take a shot at you?

01:01:00.448 --> 01:01:02.291
Then last night,
it occurred to me:

01:01:02.326 --> 01:01:04.580
Maybe we've all been
asking the wrong question.

01:01:04.615 --> 01:01:09.058
Maybe the shooter hit exactly what
he was aiming at, your bodyguard.

01:01:09.093 --> 01:01:12.295
- That's insane.
- Who'd want to hurt Jason Rondstadt?

01:01:12.330 --> 01:01:16.541
- That's not exactly showing initiative.
- Right, but what if...

01:01:17.325 --> 01:01:20.689
what if Jason Rondstadt...

01:01:21.425 --> 01:01:25.642
was the bodyguard
who knew too much?

01:01:29.705 --> 01:01:33.498
You were dipping into
the war chest again.

01:01:36.228 --> 01:01:38.060
You got to be kidding.

01:01:38.095 --> 01:01:40.118
That's old news, Monk.

01:01:40.153 --> 01:01:43.977
Mr. St. Claire, bear with me,
please, sir. On your mark.

01:01:44.820 --> 01:01:47.338
Here's what I think happened.

01:01:47.932 --> 01:01:51.108
Nicole Vasques was
going over the books,

01:01:51.143 --> 01:01:53.085
and some numbers
didn't add up.

01:01:53.120 --> 01:01:54.221
Excuse me, sir.

01:01:54.256 --> 01:01:56.302
I was wondering if I could
talk to you for a sec.

01:01:56.337 --> 01:01:59.675
It seems that a large sum of money
is going into a different account.

01:01:59.710 --> 01:02:02.667
She asked you about it,
and you brushed her off.

01:02:02.702 --> 01:02:04.505
Thanks for catching that, honey.
That's what I pay you for.

01:02:04.540 --> 01:02:06.599
I'll look into it, all right?
Nice job.

01:02:07.168 --> 01:02:10.745
Maybe you even accused
her of stealing the money.

01:02:13.373 --> 01:02:14.755
Can you believe this guy?

01:02:14.790 --> 01:02:17.970
You are out of your mind,
out of your mind.

01:02:18.005 --> 01:02:20.816
You started to worry
the girl might talk.

01:02:20.851 --> 01:02:24.853
You couldn't buy her off. She had
a little something we call integrity.

01:02:24.888 --> 01:02:28.283
So you decided it was time
to hire somebody to kill her,

01:02:28.318 --> 01:02:30.204
but who?

01:02:30.847 --> 01:02:33.490
You asked Jason Rondstadt,

01:02:34.871 --> 01:02:37.119
but he turned you down.

01:02:39.014 --> 01:02:42.727
You were in hell,
surrounded by honest people.

01:02:43.230 --> 01:02:45.425
I don't have to stand here
and listen to this.

01:02:45.460 --> 01:02:46.725
Yes, you do.

01:02:46.760 --> 01:02:48.450
- Yes, you do.
- Okay.

01:02:48.485 --> 01:02:50.012
Thanks, Captain.

01:02:50.047 --> 01:02:52.364
You kept shopping around.

01:02:52.399 --> 01:02:55.517
You found a professional, Ian Sykes.

01:02:56.776 --> 01:02:59.387
Sykes killed the girl...

01:02:59.422 --> 01:03:02.575
but you still had
one loose end left...

01:03:02.610 --> 01:03:06.126
Jason Rondstadt,
the first guy you asked.

01:03:06.560 --> 01:03:08.201
But, hell, that's all right.

01:03:08.236 --> 01:03:11.731
Flying 17 combat
missions in the Gulf...

01:03:17.390 --> 01:03:20.608
Killing Jason Rondstadt
in public was brilliant...

01:03:20.643 --> 01:03:23.526
'cause everyone assumed it
was an assassination attempt,

01:03:23.561 --> 01:03:25.553
and you got a two for.

01:03:25.588 --> 01:03:28.898
Your problem was eliminated,
and your candidate gets to look heroic.

01:03:28.933 --> 01:03:31.198
I don't suppose you're gonna
be able to prove any of this.

01:03:31.233 --> 01:03:34.490
Well, here was your mistake.

01:03:34.525 --> 01:03:36.281
My mistake?

01:03:37.420 --> 01:03:39.155
Hey.

01:03:42.141 --> 01:03:45.429
This photograph was taken
seconds after the shooting.

01:03:45.464 --> 01:03:47.795
That's you, isn't it, pointing up
at the sniper? - Yeah. So what?

01:03:47.830 --> 01:03:49.465
He's up there!

01:03:50.684 --> 01:03:52.243
Up there!

01:03:53.936 --> 01:03:56.207
You're the only one pointing.

01:03:57.014 --> 01:03:59.404
How did you know where he was?

01:04:02.434 --> 01:04:05.235
Because I saw him.
He was right up there.

01:04:05.270 --> 01:04:07.285
Look.

01:04:07.461 --> 01:04:09.376
Oh, yeah, I almost forgot.

01:04:10.741 --> 01:04:13.669
Gentlemen, gentlemen, if you please.

01:04:14.524 --> 01:04:23.304
Last Thursday, there were
approximately 400 balloons right here.

01:04:23.630 --> 01:04:27.118
There's only one way you could've
known where Ian Sykes was.

01:04:27.153 --> 01:04:30.265
- You hired the man.
- This is totally ridiculous.

01:04:30.300 --> 01:04:34.450
It all happened so fast.
It was chaotic. It was chaos.

01:04:34.485 --> 01:04:38.386
Maybe I, uh, maybe I didn't see him.
Maybe I heard the shots.

01:04:41.049 --> 01:04:43.240
- You heard them?
- Yes, I definitely heard them.

01:04:43.275 --> 01:04:44.999
I definitely heard them.
We all heard them.

01:04:45.034 --> 01:04:47.473
They were coming from up there.

01:04:48.280 --> 01:04:51.813
Well, if that's true, then you won't
have any trouble finding Sharona.

01:04:51.848 --> 01:04:53.828
What?

01:04:53.863 --> 01:04:57.133
She is up there in
one of these buildings...

01:04:57.168 --> 01:04:59.373
with a starter's pistol.

01:04:59.582 --> 01:05:01.015
Heckle, this is Jeckle.

01:05:01.050 --> 01:05:01.902
Are you all set?

01:05:01.937 --> 01:05:04.091
Anytime, Jeckle.

01:05:04.126 --> 01:05:05.352
Let's do it.

01:05:16.956 --> 01:05:20.289
It's kind oflike
an echo chamber, isn't it?

01:05:22.403 --> 01:05:24.143
You want to take
another chance?

01:05:24.178 --> 01:05:26.265
Heckle, we're going
for best out of three.

01:05:38.923 --> 01:05:41.152
- There.
- There?

01:05:42.963 --> 01:05:44.668
No, uh,

01:05:44.703 --> 01:05:47.232
- over there.
- Are you sure?

01:05:47.402 --> 01:05:49.106
Oh, my God.

01:05:49.141 --> 01:05:51.453
No, wait, wait, wait.

01:05:52.894 --> 01:05:55.928
Do it again. Do it again!

01:05:56.190 --> 01:05:59.334
And you called yourself my Moses.

01:05:59.460 --> 01:06:03.280
Like the real Moses, he won't
bejoining you in the promised land.

01:06:05.526 --> 01:06:07.764
Warren, I didn't have any choice!

01:06:07.799 --> 01:06:10.154
That girl, Nicole,
she would have buried me!

01:06:10.189 --> 01:06:12.330
She would have buried both of us!

01:06:13.841 --> 01:06:15.775
Warren!

01:06:17.423 --> 01:06:19.653
Okay, Sharona, cut it out.
That's enough.

01:06:19.688 --> 01:06:21.916
We got him. It's all over.

01:06:26.804 --> 01:06:29.155
Sharona?

01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:32.265
- Let's go!
- Everybody out of here!

01:06:32.763 --> 01:06:34.372
Go! Go! Go! Go!

01:06:46.974 --> 01:06:49.519
Oh, my God, it's Sykes.
He's here.

01:06:49.554 --> 01:06:50.884
Sykes? What's he doing here?

01:06:50.919 --> 01:06:53.947
I think he and Gavin are having
some kind of contract dispute.

01:06:59.332 --> 01:07:01.510
He's leaving.
I'm gonna follow him.

01:07:01.681 --> 01:07:04.117
Where are you going, Sharona?
Just stay put.

01:07:13.045 --> 01:07:16.237
He's stashing his gun.

01:07:17.121 --> 01:07:19.409
He's going downstairs.

01:07:19.745 --> 01:07:22.345
All right, just stay put.
Stay right where you are.

01:07:22.490 --> 01:07:25.009
- Who does she think she is?
- I don't know. Lois Lane.

01:07:37.202 --> 01:07:39.321
He's in the boiler room.

01:07:39.356 --> 01:07:43.229
Sharona! I can't hear you.
I've lost you. Come back.

01:07:43.264 --> 01:07:47.031
Okay. We got him. Block it up.
Cover every door, every window.

01:07:53.769 --> 01:07:55.793
- He's not coming out.
- What?

01:07:55.828 --> 01:07:58.559
No. He'd expect you
to cover the street.

01:07:58.594 --> 01:07:59.464
He's got some other way.

01:07:59.499 --> 01:08:01.421
- He has a plan.
- How do you know that?

01:08:01.456 --> 01:08:03.332
'Cause he's smart.

01:08:03.367 --> 01:08:06.249
- Sharona, come back.
- Keep an eye on him.

01:08:06.284 --> 01:08:08.538
How many guys
you got in the back?

01:08:10.446 --> 01:08:12.622
Monk, he's going through a door.

01:08:12.657 --> 01:08:15.122
I think it's a tunnel.
I'm gonna follow him.

01:08:15.333 --> 01:08:18.095
Let's go! Let's go!
Everybody out!

01:08:18.218 --> 01:08:20.081
- What about the basement?
- By the book, Monk.

01:08:20.116 --> 01:08:22.859
We secure the exits, then
we work top to bottom. Give me that.

01:08:22.894 --> 01:08:24.703
What about Sharona?
He might have Sharona.

01:08:24.738 --> 01:08:26.594
We'll take care of Sharona.
Just stay here.

01:09:04.252 --> 01:09:06.027
Monk, can you hear me?

01:09:11.033 --> 01:09:13.014
Oh, no.

01:09:22.430 --> 01:09:24.116
Monk.

01:09:31.761 --> 01:09:35.676
Adrian, can you hear me?
I can't hear you.

01:09:53.444 --> 01:09:55.171
Monk, where are you?

01:09:55.854 --> 01:09:58.936
Oh, great, a hostage.

01:09:58.981 --> 01:10:00.302
Help!

01:10:21.247 --> 01:10:22.721
We got upstairs secured.

01:10:22.756 --> 01:10:25.329
Good. Now do the basement,
and watch your back.

01:10:25.364 --> 01:10:27.085
Captain, have you seen Monk?

01:10:27.120 --> 01:10:28.582
No. Why?

01:10:28.617 --> 01:10:30.609
He's, uh, got my gun.

01:11:19.732 --> 01:11:22.417
Monk! Monk, help!

01:11:36.422 --> 01:11:38.805
Hold it! I have a gun.!

01:11:39.073 --> 01:11:41.187
Sykes, hold it!

01:11:41.900 --> 01:11:43.547
Shoot him!

01:11:50.501 --> 01:11:52.657
Shoot him!

01:11:52.765 --> 01:11:56.776
I'm not bluffing!
I have a gun.

01:11:58.960 --> 01:12:00.553
Shoot him!

01:12:14.166 --> 01:12:16.285
Will you shoot him!

01:12:22.817 --> 01:12:24.952
Let her go, Sykes!

01:12:25.098 --> 01:12:27.370
Let... Let her go!

01:12:49.578 --> 01:12:50.902
What the hell were you thinking?

01:12:50.937 --> 01:12:52.678
You kept saying,
"Shoot him.! Shoot him!"

01:12:52.713 --> 01:12:55.272
Adrian, I could've been killed!

01:12:55.307 --> 01:12:56.758
I knew what I was doing.

01:12:56.793 --> 01:12:58.321
I was aiming high.

01:12:58.356 --> 01:13:00.111
He's like 20 feet tall!

01:13:00.146 --> 01:13:01.827
What if you missed?
You could've missed!

01:13:01.862 --> 01:13:05.794
Oh, right! How could I have missed?
The guy's King Kong.

01:13:06.649 --> 01:13:09.007
What if it ricocheted?

01:13:09.597 --> 01:13:12.153
Well, that... that's true.
I didn't think of that.

01:13:15.788 --> 01:13:18.065
Hello?

01:13:21.404 --> 01:13:23.535
Snowmen.

01:13:26.220 --> 01:13:28.137
Give me the gun.
Give me the gun.

01:13:31.573 --> 01:13:34.979
Here he is. Come and
meet a genuine hero.

01:13:35.014 --> 01:13:35.730
Congratulations, Mr. Monk.

01:13:35.765 --> 01:13:37.686
Mr. Monk,

01:13:37.721 --> 01:13:41.267
on behalf of myself, Miranda,

01:13:41.302 --> 01:13:46.539
and the city of San Francisco,
I want to thank you.

01:13:48.226 --> 01:13:50.511
Well done.

01:13:52.051 --> 01:13:54.273
Well done.

01:13:56.665 --> 01:13:58.640
Mr. Monk, what next?

01:13:58.675 --> 01:14:02.657
- Mr. Monk, an I get a picture, please?
- Mr. Monk, over here, please. Mr. Monk.

01:14:06.668 --> 01:14:09.718
My son wants your autograph.

01:14:09.753 --> 01:14:12.490
Really. No, you're his hero.

01:14:12.525 --> 01:14:14.682
He put your picture up on the wall.

01:14:14.717 --> 01:14:17.580
Well, I would be
happy to meet the boy,

01:14:17.615 --> 01:14:19.951
but anybody would've
done the same thing.

01:14:19.986 --> 01:14:21.694
I don't know about that, Adrian.

01:14:21.729 --> 01:14:24.255
I mean, there were
20 cops at that scene.

01:14:24.290 --> 01:14:26.201
Nobody did what you did.

01:14:26.236 --> 01:14:29.632
Well... Well.

01:14:29.709 --> 01:14:33.909
You know, I think we're making
some real progress here, and I think...

01:14:33.944 --> 01:14:40.190
I think it might be time that I talked to
the department about reinstatement.

01:14:44.543 --> 01:14:46.842
Would you like that?

01:14:50.547 --> 01:14:52.358
- I can't promise anything.
- Oh, I understand.

01:14:52.393 --> 01:14:54.770
I can only make
a recommendation, okay?

01:14:54.805 --> 01:14:56.210
- I understand.
- All right.

01:14:56.245 --> 01:14:59.009
They might want you to meet
with some other doctors.

01:14:59.044 --> 01:15:00.156
No problem.

01:15:00.191 --> 01:15:03.152
It's not gonna be that easy, Adrian.
There's gonna be more testing.

01:15:03.187 --> 01:15:05.382
Let's do it.
I want to take them right now.

01:15:05.417 --> 01:15:07.630
- I want to take them right now.
- Alright, alright.

01:15:13.267 --> 01:15:14.758
Going down?

01:15:19.180 --> 01:15:21.573
- See you next week.
- Okay.

01:15:37.501 --> 01:15:39.294
How'd it go?

01:15:39.952 --> 01:15:41.413
You know.

01:15:41.448 --> 01:15:44.111
Aw, don't worry,
we'll get them next time.

01:15:44.146 --> 01:15:46.776
Come on, I'll make
you some dinner.

01:15:48.355 --> 01:15:50.027
Oh, yeah, it's Tuesday.

01:15:50.062 --> 01:15:52.209
Tuesday night's chicken potpie.

01:15:52.244 --> 01:15:55.860
You know, actually, I thought we'd
try something a little different this week.

01:15:55.895 --> 01:15:58.695
I'm kidding. I'm kidding.

01:15:58.730 --> 01:16:00.218
Just kidding.

01:16:01.455 --> 01:16:03.345
Adrian, you missed one.

01:16:06.804 --> 01:16:08.943
Five.

01:16:09.708 --> 01:16:11.405
Six.
