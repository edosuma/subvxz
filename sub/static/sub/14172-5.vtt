00:00.952 --> 00:02.471
Previously on <i> Tyrant...</i>

00:02.656 --> 00:07.188
This act will be remembered
as the first great act of defiance.

00:08.328 --> 00:10.982
Ihab Rashid is behind all this.

00:11.032 --> 00:12.699
I'm done wishing for change.

00:12.749 --> 00:13.856
I am making it happen.

00:13.906 --> 00:15.708
The wedding night is very special.

00:15.758 --> 00:17.287
It's important to be pure.

00:17.337 --> 00:18.623
It's not safe for you to be there.

00:18.673 --> 00:21.542
It's not safe for anyone there.

00:21.676 --> 00:23.614
- Run them down!
- Go!

00:23.664 --> 00:26.472
Tomorrow, there will be
only pigeons in the square.

00:26.522 --> 00:27.713
What is it you want me to do?

00:27.849 --> 00:30.584
I want you to get your hands dirty,
to go against your family.

00:30.718 --> 00:33.520
I asked Fauzi Nidal to set up
a meeting with Ihab Rashid.

00:33.655 --> 00:35.569
The man who would have
all our heads?

00:35.620 --> 00:38.437
You can go down in history
as one more brutal dictator,

00:38.865 --> 00:40.659
or you can be remembered as the leader

00:40.918 --> 00:43.619
who had the courage
to listen to his people.

00:43.696 --> 00:45.247
Who do you want to be?

00:51.353 --> 00:53.648
Jamal has asked me to gather you,

00:53.738 --> 00:56.593
the leaders of the various factions
who fill the Plaza,

00:56.711 --> 00:58.684
to meet with his American brother.

00:58.773 --> 01:02.673
This is the second time
the Palace has come to me.

01:04.262 --> 01:06.030
The agitation in the Plaza,

01:06.158 --> 01:10.397
the galvanizing of the people,
ooh, has them running scared.

01:10.738 --> 01:11.999
It's poker.

01:12.197 --> 01:14.484
Right now we have the winning hand.

01:14.534 --> 01:16.224
Why negotiate? Hmm?

01:16.274 --> 01:18.406
Nobody negotiated with Mubarak.

01:18.783 --> 01:19.995
No, no, no, no, no, no.

01:20.049 --> 01:23.211
When this Amriki walks in,

01:23.528 --> 01:24.965
I'm going to tell him exactly

01:25.015 --> 01:30.331
what it will take for us to clear the Plaza:
his brother's resignation.

01:31.542 --> 01:33.899
Jamal Al Fayeed... he can, uh,

01:34.202 --> 01:37.303
take his blood money,
go to... go to Paris.

01:37.353 --> 01:38.780
Or go to London.

01:38.873 --> 01:41.623
Spend the rest of his days
writing his memoirs.

01:41.754 --> 01:46.137
But what if he's actually
willing to offer us something?

01:46.703 --> 01:47.863
No.

01:48.694 --> 01:51.287
His father betrayed my father.

01:52.323 --> 01:54.858
I'm not about to let him do
the same thing to me.

01:55.228 --> 02:00.603
The only offer we will take is
for Jamal Al Fayeed to leave Abbudin.

02:09.765 --> 02:11.134
You sure about this?

02:11.949 --> 02:13.231
I'm sure of one thing.

02:13.318 --> 02:17.509
A narcissist with a messiah complex
is not about to negotiate with me.

02:17.931 --> 02:21.129
Look, I'm betting
Ihab told everyone in earshot

02:21.179 --> 02:23.460
that an Al Fayeed
asked to sit down with him.

02:23.654 --> 02:24.944
He said yes so quickly,

02:24.994 --> 02:27.125
'cause he wants to tell me
where to go in front of an audience,

02:27.193 --> 02:30.844
but now he's gonna have to explain
why he's sitting at the table alone.

02:32.583 --> 02:35.968
For my plan to work,
I have to take him down a notch.

02:37.385 --> 02:38.852
Make the call.

02:43.887 --> 02:46.453
Father, where are you?
Everyone's here, and they're...

02:47.171 --> 02:48.334
Okay.

02:48.523 --> 02:49.939
Okay.

02:50.892 --> 02:52.276
It's my father.

03:00.935 --> 03:02.736
You are late.

03:12.922 --> 03:15.202
What do you mean you are not coming?!

03:16.797 --> 03:18.396
That is bullshit!

03:50.411 --> 03:52.556
Thank you, my friend.

03:53.412 --> 03:55.820
You know, I'm worried for you, Bassam.

03:55.948 --> 03:59.173
Been a while since anyone called me that.

03:59.906 --> 04:03.333
You know this game you're playing,
it's a dangerous game.

04:04.912 --> 04:06.697
I don't see another option.

04:06.834 --> 04:09.703
I have to clear the Plaza before Tariq does.

04:18.934 --> 04:20.051
The garage meet.

04:21.278 --> 04:22.297
Classic.

04:24.024 --> 04:25.320
This is insane.

04:25.370 --> 04:28.180
Why set a meet with Ihab

04:28.570 --> 04:30.488
so you can stand him up?

04:30.712 --> 04:33.493
Ihab's having his moment.
He was never gonna bargain.

04:33.634 --> 04:36.374
So I had to take the wind out of his sails.

04:36.898 --> 04:38.025
Ihab's a boy.

04:38.075 --> 04:39.817
I want to see his father,

04:40.028 --> 04:43.305
the man who almost
made peace with my father.

04:43.730 --> 04:45.955
I was here, Tucker, okay?
I saw it.

04:46.022 --> 04:48.193
The people adored him.

04:49.513 --> 04:52.164
I need an hour with Sheik Rashid.

04:53.347 --> 04:58.670
So, you want to use Sheik Rashid
to do an end run around Ihab?

04:58.906 --> 05:03.078
I mean, what... what happened
to the nice family doctor from Pasadena?

05:03.161 --> 05:04.389
Don't screw me around, John.

05:04.439 --> 05:07.071
The U.S. brokered
Sheik Rashid's asylum 20 years ago.

05:07.135 --> 05:10.422
I need to talk to him,
and you know where he is.

05:11.170 --> 05:13.144
Does your brother
even know you're here?

05:14.348 --> 05:17.161
I didn't say anything,
because he'd never give me this much rope.

05:17.272 --> 05:19.850
Well, if you want to hang yourself
with it, be my guest.

05:19.936 --> 05:22.343
Don't expect me to build the gallows.

05:22.615 --> 05:25.055
Tucker, I'm just trying
to keep America's ass

05:25.106 --> 05:27.932
from landing on the wrong side of history.

05:28.661 --> 05:30.640
Uh-huh.

05:31.548 --> 05:35.048
Which doesn't involve turning you
into another Daniel Pearl.

05:35.170 --> 05:38.664
My job is to protect
American citizens, not serve them up.

05:38.818 --> 05:43.093
You end up dead in the desert in a trail

05:43.143 --> 05:46.330
- that leads back to the U.S. Embassy...
- What do you want?

05:46.650 --> 05:49.227
In return, what do you want?

05:50.087 --> 05:51.973
An inside seat?

05:52.322 --> 05:56.011
A heads up on what's happening
as it happens?

05:57.763 --> 06:00.743
Are you offering
to spy on your brother?

06:03.117 --> 06:04.870
I have 24 hours.

06:05.612 --> 06:06.935
You have less.

06:18.464 --> 06:20.436
I need to speak to the president.

06:20.567 --> 06:21.673
Uh...

06:23.246 --> 06:24.973
But he-he isn't...

06:25.308 --> 06:26.677
Shall I leave him a,

06:26.782 --> 06:29.008
um, message?

06:33.784 --> 06:35.638
Who drowned your puppy?

06:36.488 --> 06:38.202
Have you seen your husband?

06:39.177 --> 06:40.891
I'm not his keeper.

06:41.396 --> 06:44.263
At least tell me why
he ordered me to stand down.

06:44.506 --> 06:46.556
I was about to send
two brigades to the Plaza,

06:46.626 --> 06:50.210
and all of a sudden,
he changes his mind with no explanation.

06:50.459 --> 06:52.080
He won't take my calls.

06:52.416 --> 06:53.912
He's cancelled his meetings for the day.

06:53.976 --> 06:56.195
The president isn't required
to consult with his wife

06:56.245 --> 06:58.014
on every decision he makes.

06:58.474 --> 07:00.680
But as his wife, you should know.

07:00.840 --> 07:03.049
If Jamal isn't prepared
to defend the regime,

07:03.138 --> 07:05.012
there are others who will.

07:07.716 --> 07:11.947
I hope, for your sake,
you're not threatening my husband.

07:11.997 --> 07:15.316
On the contrary,
I'm trying to protect him.

09:06.704 --> 09:10.474
Now these Al Fayeeds,

09:11.058 --> 09:12.928
they want to give us platitudes.

09:13.014 --> 09:14.044
He's a parrot.

09:14.523 --> 09:17.938
His mouth moves,
but other people's words come out.

09:18.244 --> 09:21.881
La BoÃ©tie, Guevara and his father, the Sheik.

09:21.931 --> 09:24.159
As men and women of...

09:24.209 --> 09:29.448
But you, you are in the position to
make your own history.

09:29.498 --> 09:33.354
Start with a compliment, end with an ask.

09:33.404 --> 09:34.762
What do you want?

09:35.828 --> 09:38.358
Yesterday in the Plaza,
they nearly killed you.

09:38.948 --> 09:39.956
You exaggerate.

09:40.006 --> 09:41.737
No, I was there, Jamal.

09:42.219 --> 09:43.514
Three weeks,

09:43.657 --> 09:47.343
and the people are already
questioning your leadership.

09:47.682 --> 09:49.629
Now is the time to be firm,

09:49.713 --> 09:52.836
to show them that you are in control.

09:56.541 --> 09:59.590
Why are you holding back Tariq?

09:59.953 --> 10:00.992
Why?

10:01.334 --> 10:02.376
For you.

10:02.625 --> 10:05.202
- For me?
- If I move against the Plaza,

10:05.276 --> 10:07.772
ten times as many will rise up against me,

10:07.859 --> 10:09.198
against my family.

10:09.902 --> 10:11.768
This is certain, Leila.

10:13.214 --> 10:15.065
So what do I do?

10:15.928 --> 10:18.134
I wait until tomorrow.

10:20.653 --> 10:23.815
Maybe these clouds will bring a storm.

10:27.159 --> 10:30.698
Or maybe something
will happen to clear them.

10:33.925 --> 10:37.394
Is this you talking?
Or is it Bassam?

10:40.788 --> 10:44.401
Maybe Ihab is not
the only parrot in this country.

10:47.150 --> 10:52.075
Don't make the mistake of getting
between me and my brother.

11:02.268 --> 11:04.107
Reema, what are you doing?

11:04.199 --> 11:06.418
I was just straightening up.

11:06.891 --> 11:08.739
Hold on.

11:10.255 --> 11:12.629
Let me see what's in your pocket.

11:18.896 --> 11:20.837
I'll be in the servants' quarters
until the police arrive.

11:20.972 --> 11:23.640
Just wait.

11:24.449 --> 11:26.126
First tell me why you need Vicodin.

11:26.176 --> 11:27.778
Not me.

11:28.247 --> 11:29.713
My brother Salam.

11:29.763 --> 11:31.687
What's wrong with him?

11:32.417 --> 11:33.617
Reema...

11:34.203 --> 11:35.519
He broke his arm.

11:36.860 --> 11:38.520
He was fixing the roof and he fell.

11:38.570 --> 11:40.774
Well, if his arm is broken,
he needs a doctor to set it.

11:40.824 --> 11:43.139
- You have to take him to the hospital.
- No hospital.

11:43.222 --> 11:45.460
- Why not?
- Please, ma'am.

11:48.034 --> 11:49.472
Okay, tell you what...

11:50.268 --> 11:51.686
You take me to see your brother,

11:51.736 --> 11:53.804
and this stays between us.

11:54.616 --> 11:56.758
You will tell no one?

11:57.292 --> 11:58.308
No.

12:10.930 --> 12:12.647
Where's the fire?

12:26.797 --> 12:28.739
You smell like tequila.

12:30.020 --> 12:32.740
I have to help your grandma
with seating arrangements, okay?

12:33.166 --> 12:36.426
Baby, it's been a month
and we still haven't...

12:37.210 --> 12:39.403
I didn't get married
to take care of my own needs!

12:48.399 --> 12:52.063
Mother, this is really beautiful.

12:52.191 --> 12:53.879
Not nearly

12:53.962 --> 12:56.893
- as beautiful as your daughter-in-law.
- Yes,

12:56.943 --> 12:59.058
Ahmed is a lucky man.

13:03.607 --> 13:06.517
Is this my grandson I feel in there?

13:10.059 --> 13:11.811
Bassam is waiting for me.

13:12.860 --> 13:15.193
Your father would be so happy

13:15.264 --> 13:18.080
to see his two sons working together like this.

13:18.221 --> 13:19.784
He would have been.

13:22.815 --> 13:24.861
Are you all right, Nusrat?

13:28.151 --> 13:33.451
The ambassador is deaf in his left ear,
so I'm going to put you on his right side.

13:36.498 --> 13:38.045
So...

13:39.430 --> 13:42.617
when am I sitting down with this asshole?

13:42.889 --> 13:44.501
I'm still working out the details.

13:44.551 --> 13:45.980
What details?

13:46.390 --> 13:49.939
He shows up when and where we say!

13:49.989 --> 13:52.068
Yeah, it's not...
it's not quite as simple as that.

13:52.118 --> 13:52.896
It is simple.

13:52.946 --> 13:55.511
Who's the president, me or him?

13:58.778 --> 14:00.400
What aren't you telling me?

14:00.450 --> 14:01.906
Nothing. He's just, uh...

14:01.956 --> 14:03.509
the guy's playing hard to get.

14:03.559 --> 14:04.524
Hard to get?

14:04.574 --> 14:08.500
Maybe he will play nicer
with electrodes on his balls.

14:10.377 --> 14:13.583
Can you please just give
me a little more time?

14:13.689 --> 14:15.952
How much time do you think I have?

14:16.688 --> 14:19.387
I've already got Leila crawling up my ass.

14:19.437 --> 14:22.404
While you are out
buying flowers for this shitball,

14:22.794 --> 14:26.272
I'm starting to look like some pussy
who can't pull the trigger.

14:26.322 --> 14:27.861
Jamal, I'm working on it.

14:27.911 --> 14:29.153
Working on it?

14:29.345 --> 14:32.557
Well, stop working on it and get it done.

14:42.240 --> 14:45.410
- Abbudin!
- Abbudin!

14:46.350 --> 14:48.082
- He humiliated me.
- Relax, relax.

14:48.132 --> 14:50.490
No, no, no, no, no!
I'm not going to relax.

14:50.579 --> 14:51.637
He can't do this.

14:51.701 --> 14:53.457
It makes me look like a fool.

14:53.540 --> 14:55.477
That was the point, wasn't it?

14:56.091 --> 14:58.607
Take the mic,
paint him as the liar he is!

14:58.657 --> 15:01.484
Oh, and look like a child
who dropped his ice cream, huh?

15:01.534 --> 15:02.945
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

15:03.012 --> 15:04.659
What is the game he's playing?

15:04.732 --> 15:06.152
Same game as you are.

15:06.225 --> 15:08.815
You were only there to tell him off to his face.

15:09.256 --> 15:10.401
You...

15:10.554 --> 15:11.778
you knew all along

15:11.828 --> 15:14.058
- Bassam was going to blow me off.
- What?!

15:14.128 --> 15:15.238
No! No!

15:15.288 --> 15:17.380
You set the location, set the time.

15:17.430 --> 15:18.334
Ihab, stop!

15:18.384 --> 15:20.740
You're letting your anger
get the best of you

15:20.842 --> 15:23.342
at a time when the people
need your leadership.

15:23.630 --> 15:26.203
People are trusting you with their lives.

15:27.249 --> 15:28.537
People I know!

15:28.614 --> 15:29.493
My friends!

15:29.599 --> 15:31.590
You don't think
I know that, little girl?

15:31.640 --> 15:32.879
Hmm?

15:33.876 --> 15:35.897
I am not here by accident.

15:37.260 --> 15:40.529
Free Abbudin!
Free Abbudin!

15:40.664 --> 15:42.508
Free Abbudin!
Free Abbudin!

15:42.559 --> 15:44.311
Abbudin!

15:48.499 --> 15:49.976
Jamal's given me 24 hours

15:50.069 --> 15:52.439
to see if I can clear the Plaza peacefully.

15:54.174 --> 15:55.281
What are you gonna do?

15:55.331 --> 15:58.631
Tucker is reaching out
to Ihab's father, the Sheik,

15:58.789 --> 16:00.847
to try and arrange a meeting.

16:00.954 --> 16:03.413
Before my father
launched the attack on Ma'an,

16:03.463 --> 16:05.107
he and the Sheik
sat down for peace talks.

16:05.389 --> 16:07.859
Rashid was prepared
to negotiate a peaceful solution.

16:07.920 --> 16:10.250
Yeah, and then he bombed the Palace.

16:10.325 --> 16:13.106
An army barracks.
And it was his followers, not him.

16:13.393 --> 16:17.935
Look, 20 years ago, Rashid was prepared
to negotiate with my father.

16:18.003 --> 16:18.908
Despite what happened,

16:18.980 --> 16:20.165
me sitting down with him now

16:20.243 --> 16:24.064
is the only hope we have to stop
this blowing up in our faces.

16:24.775 --> 16:26.426
Who's going with you?

16:28.247 --> 16:30.577
I don't know
all the details yet, okay?

16:30.627 --> 16:32.095
Tucker's gonna call me back.

16:32.198 --> 16:34.758
Until then,
I'm going to go for a run, okay?

16:34.808 --> 16:36.483
So it's a suicide mission.

16:36.594 --> 16:38.316
That's blowing it out of proportion.

16:38.366 --> 16:40.739
And Molly, really,
I don't have another choice here.

16:40.789 --> 16:42.621
Of course you have another choice.

16:42.772 --> 16:45.224
You also have two kids and a wife.

16:45.406 --> 16:46.398
I mean...

16:46.752 --> 16:48.573
you're gonna get yourself killed, Barry.

16:48.774 --> 16:51.330
Honey, we're not at home
listening to this on NPR,

16:51.380 --> 16:52.547
we're in it.

16:52.676 --> 16:54.408
And I can do something my father couldn't...

16:54.458 --> 16:55.378
I can end this peacefully.

16:55.428 --> 16:58.038
That's Jamal's job, not yours.

16:58.460 --> 17:00.193
Why are you putting
your life on this line for this?

17:00.243 --> 17:03.654
'Cause my name's not
Smith or Jones!

17:04.800 --> 17:05.931
If I didn't know you better,

17:06.027 --> 17:09.064
I'd say you were starting
to get off on this.

17:18.009 --> 17:20.935
Hakim, I know Nusrat is here.

17:21.300 --> 17:23.637
Now is not a good time.
She's upset.

17:23.893 --> 17:25.683
Which is why
she should be with her husband

17:25.765 --> 17:28.961
and not run to her parents like a child!

17:31.410 --> 17:33.331
We had a thing this morning,

17:33.527 --> 17:36.139
now she's not returning my calls.

17:36.834 --> 17:39.546
I swear I'll talk sense into her.

17:40.302 --> 17:42.405
You have my word.

17:48.788 --> 17:52.533
Do have any idea what position
you are putting our family in?

17:52.626 --> 17:56.076
Everything we have,
it's all from Al Fayeeds!

17:56.721 --> 17:57.861
I want a divorce.

17:57.961 --> 17:59.383
Don't be stupid.

18:00.645 --> 18:03.977
Why did you agree to marry Ahmed
if you don't love him?

18:07.848 --> 18:09.344
Tell him.

18:09.808 --> 18:11.846
Tell me what?

18:15.813 --> 18:17.859
Tell me what?

18:20.703 --> 18:22.520
It's not Ahmed.

18:25.004 --> 18:26.740
It's Jamal.

18:33.925 --> 18:34.681
Yeah.

18:34.912 --> 18:35.970
Barry, it's Tucker.

18:36.020 --> 18:39.075
The person you wanted me
to reach out to agreed to meet.

18:39.360 --> 18:40.243
Okay.

18:40.293 --> 18:42.824
- I'll go back and tell Molly...
- You can call Molly from the road.

18:42.874 --> 18:44.235
I'm about to jump in the car.

18:44.285 --> 18:45.882
Meet me outside the gate.

18:47.133 --> 18:49.090
I'm on my way.

18:50.038 --> 18:51.691
All right, guys, that's it for the day.

19:18.182 --> 19:20.616
Thank you for arranging
this meeting with your father.

19:20.666 --> 19:21.992
Namir Rashid...

19:22.598 --> 19:24.194
Bassam Al Fayeed.

19:24.366 --> 19:26.686
Okay, come with me.

19:28.332 --> 19:29.751
Oh, no, no... you stay here.

19:29.818 --> 19:32.566
No, no, no, no,
that wasn't the arrangement.

19:32.965 --> 19:34.779
I told my father
we should kill him right here,

19:34.829 --> 19:36.323
but this is his wish.

19:37.720 --> 19:40.254
Turn around, Al Fayeed.

19:44.135 --> 19:46.116
- It's okay.
- Do it.

19:51.628 --> 19:54.302
When this, uh,
Amriki walks in here,

19:54.352 --> 19:55.488
I'm going to tell him exactly

19:55.538 --> 20:00.635
what it will take for us to clear
his brother's resignation.

20:00.877 --> 20:04.936
Our security forces
track Ihab Rashid's movements.

20:04.986 --> 20:07.666
Imagine their surprise and my embarrassment

20:07.716 --> 20:10.675
upon learning
he was meeting with your brother.

20:11.558 --> 20:14.313
Bassam is working for me.

20:14.637 --> 20:17.933
He is meeting Ihab Rashid on my orders.

20:19.923 --> 20:24.424
Bassam's been nowhere
near Ihab in the last 24 hours.

20:25.297 --> 20:27.218
That is wrong.

20:27.785 --> 20:30.016
That is wrong!

20:30.144 --> 20:34.029
I spoke to Bassam
right after their meeting.

20:34.207 --> 20:35.953
He looked me in the eyes

20:36.092 --> 20:39.018
and told me they are ironing out details.

20:39.068 --> 20:41.053
Then he lied to you!

20:43.121 --> 20:44.985
He's had no contact with Ihab.

20:45.035 --> 20:48.071
As a matter of fact, Bassam ditched his security.

20:48.121 --> 20:49.464
He is nowhere to be found.

20:49.543 --> 20:52.819
This is why you refuse to clear the Plaza?

20:56.432 --> 20:57.669
Bassam...

20:57.968 --> 21:00.010
doesn't keep his promises.

21:00.316 --> 21:02.120
How the hell would you know?

21:03.774 --> 21:05.506
Hi, you've reached Barry Al Fayeed.

21:05.566 --> 21:07.272
Please leave your name and...

21:08.863 --> 21:11.729
Sir, at least allow me
to move my forces into position.

21:12.955 --> 21:13.926
Fine.

21:15.004 --> 21:18.436
But they stand down until I give the order.

21:35.166 --> 21:36.693
My lungs...

21:39.149 --> 21:43.386
A souvenir of the day
your father gassed Ma'an.

21:44.294 --> 21:47.508
You met my son, Namir.

21:48.937 --> 21:49.742
Yeah, he, uh...

21:49.792 --> 21:51.501
he drove me from the border.

21:52.273 --> 21:55.139
The hood kind of limited the conversation.

21:55.566 --> 21:58.561
Sheik Rashid:
You understand our precautions.

21:59.259 --> 22:00.348
Yes.

22:00.419 --> 22:05.247
I have always been curious
about Khaled's American son.

22:08.654 --> 22:09.696
death to the Al Fayeed!

22:10.922 --> 22:13.507
Death to the Al Fayeed!

22:18.791 --> 22:21.235
Death to the Al Fayeeds!

22:21.717 --> 22:24.338
I apologize for his actions,

22:24.890 --> 22:27.350
but his anger is understandable.

22:27.443 --> 22:30.743
His family was wiped out by yours.

22:32.260 --> 22:37.027
Bassam Al Fayeed,
yesterday you were my enemy,

22:37.508 --> 22:43.005
but today you are my guest.

22:44.660 --> 22:46.455
Sheik Rashid,
I need to talk to you about...

22:46.505 --> 22:48.029
That's not the way it's done.

22:48.125 --> 22:50.997
First, we eat.

22:58.927 --> 23:01.319
Mr. President, you are too kind,

23:01.857 --> 23:05.464
taking time away
from important issues of state

23:05.571 --> 23:07.974
to deal with a personal matter.

23:08.586 --> 23:10.616
To what do we owe this pleasure?

23:10.958 --> 23:12.606
Marriage...

23:12.983 --> 23:16.191
it's a complicated proposition,

23:16.334 --> 23:19.093
and Nusrat has always been...

23:19.502 --> 23:20.806
fragile.

23:21.489 --> 23:23.269
Overly emotional.

23:24.366 --> 23:26.712
My wife and I are to blame.

23:26.762 --> 23:27.948
We coddled her.

23:28.154 --> 23:29.788
Cut to the chase.

23:29.924 --> 23:31.091
We ask for nothing,

23:31.141 --> 23:35.186
just a quick and quiet
dissolution of the marriage.

23:35.236 --> 23:36.268
Divorce?

23:36.318 --> 23:38.287
On what grounds?

23:43.175 --> 23:44.959
Tell me, Hakim.

23:48.309 --> 23:50.168
We have welcomed your daughter

23:50.218 --> 23:53.198
to this family as one of our own.

23:55.245 --> 23:57.289
Ahmed is my son.

23:58.043 --> 24:00.002
I demand to know what this is about.

24:00.052 --> 24:01.295
Please, ma'am,

24:02.287 --> 24:04.320
are the details really important?

24:06.008 --> 24:08.675
Will you wait for me outside?

24:08.739 --> 24:09.903
Sure.

24:15.657 --> 24:16.461
I will fix this.

24:16.511 --> 24:17.907
You'd better.

24:18.028 --> 24:21.378
We can't afford another humiliation.

24:21.428 --> 24:23.801
I said I will fix this.

24:28.481 --> 24:29.880
Your turn.

24:31.472 --> 24:32.618
I'm no match for you.

24:32.668 --> 24:33.619
Yeah.

24:33.914 --> 24:35.018
That's true.

24:35.086 --> 24:35.643
So,

24:36.645 --> 24:38.294
tell me, Hakim,

24:39.112 --> 24:42.285
what is this nonsense about a divorce?

24:43.364 --> 24:46.967
Your daughter has everything
a woman could want.

24:50.150 --> 24:52.845
Why you don't talk sense to her?

24:53.041 --> 24:55.964
Believe me,
Mr. President, I have tried.

24:56.131 --> 24:57.445
"Tried."

24:57.755 --> 24:59.669
Well, not hard enough.

25:04.801 --> 25:08.937
My father gave you
the telecommunication franchise

25:08.987 --> 25:10.223
in this country.

25:10.337 --> 25:13.502
Now, your family has everything it has

25:13.552 --> 25:15.823
because my family gave it to you.

25:15.873 --> 25:17.796
And I'm forever in your debt.

25:21.399 --> 25:22.991
Then act like it.

25:23.813 --> 25:24.938
Please,

25:25.059 --> 25:26.658
I beg you.

25:27.651 --> 25:30.068
There is no talking
sense with a sleepwalker.

25:30.118 --> 25:31.777
She's in a doctor's care.

25:31.827 --> 25:34.366
He prescribes therapy, medication.

25:34.928 --> 25:36.922
My daughter is weak,

25:36.972 --> 25:38.759
and your son did his best.

25:38.809 --> 25:40.030
"Did his best"?

25:40.468 --> 25:42.654
Are you saying this is Ahmed's fault?

25:42.704 --> 25:43.733
No, of course not.

25:43.783 --> 25:45.638
Then what are you saying?

25:47.781 --> 25:50.256
What reason did she give?

25:56.373 --> 26:00.406
I swear, she will go
to the grave with her secret.

26:00.478 --> 26:02.155
Tell me what she told you.

26:02.205 --> 26:04.640
Uh, it doesn't matter.

26:05.302 --> 26:07.506
You know what, you are right.

26:07.695 --> 26:09.336
It doesn't matter.

26:13.861 --> 26:17.400
There will be no divorce, Hakim.

26:21.630 --> 26:23.239
Your whore of a daughter

26:23.289 --> 26:27.868
is going to crawl back into my son's bed!

26:29.050 --> 26:31.820
She will bear him children.

26:32.197 --> 26:34.593
As many as he wants.

26:34.718 --> 26:36.306
Mr. President, please!

26:36.615 --> 26:37.602
Please, sir!

26:48.250 --> 26:49.770
It's not just his arm.

26:49.820 --> 26:51.926
He fractured multiple ribs when he fell.

26:52.062 --> 26:54.696
His pulse is racing and weak.
He's anxious.

26:55.167 --> 26:58.211
Reema, with this kind of injury,

26:58.261 --> 27:00.380
he could be bleeding on the inside.

27:00.939 --> 27:01.896
It's okay, it's okay.

27:01.968 --> 27:04.873
- We're gonna get you to a hospital.
- I said no hospital.

27:07.695 --> 27:10.217
He wasn't fixing a roof, was he?

27:12.652 --> 27:14.767
He was in the Plaza.

27:15.223 --> 27:17.544
When the president's motorcade came,

27:17.637 --> 27:19.713
people, they start pushing.

27:19.894 --> 27:23.775
He is innocent, but the camera,
they saw him.

27:24.056 --> 27:26.175
If he seeks help now, they'll arrest him.

27:26.225 --> 27:27.303
He'll die if he doesn't.

27:27.353 --> 27:28.393
Better to die here

27:28.443 --> 27:30.369
than live through what they will do to him.

27:30.504 --> 27:31.672
His friends in the Plaza,

27:31.743 --> 27:35.695
they tagged a street sign
with "free Abbudin" and were arrested.

27:35.834 --> 27:39.736
When their father went to the police,
begged for his children,

27:40.074 --> 27:41.908
he was told to make new ones.

27:45.839 --> 27:47.804
Salam is my only family.

27:51.922 --> 27:54.723
Please, help us.

27:57.470 --> 27:59.047
What's his name?

28:01.463 --> 28:02.430
Salam.

28:02.815 --> 28:04.267
Salam Halabi.

28:04.712 --> 28:07.005
Radial fracture,
multiple broken ribs,

28:07.108 --> 28:08.792
suspected hemothorax
from intercostal hemorrhaging.

28:08.842 --> 28:10.398
We need to throw in a chest tube.

28:10.480 --> 28:12.413
I'm sorry, but you can't take this man.

28:12.631 --> 28:13.930
He is wanted by the authorities.

28:13.980 --> 28:14.924
We have to alert the police...

28:14.974 --> 28:16.611
- He'll die if you wait.
- Before we admit him to the hospital.

28:16.661 --> 28:17.209
Then he'll die.

28:17.263 --> 28:19.036
No, he won't. I won't let him.

28:19.086 --> 28:20.389
And who are you?

28:22.119 --> 28:24.286
Dr. Molly Al Fayeed.

28:28.360 --> 28:29.920
We were just following the law.

28:29.973 --> 28:31.144
A thousand pardons.

28:33.270 --> 28:35.125
You don't...
you don't need to apologize to me.

28:35.175 --> 28:36.528
Just get him to the hospital.

28:36.602 --> 28:37.585
You know what,
why don't I come with you

28:37.649 --> 28:40.458
and make sure
no one else makes the same mistake.

28:48.836 --> 28:53.082
Bless Allah for protecting us
and for all that we have.

28:53.216 --> 28:56.252
-<i> Alhamdulillah.</i>
-<i> Alhamdulillah.</i>

29:00.827 --> 29:03.469
I see you are anxious to talk.

29:03.925 --> 29:05.099
Yes.

29:06.492 --> 29:08.023
Walk with me.

29:11.491 --> 29:14.481
You made a long trip to avoid

29:14.627 --> 29:16.714
the more obvious choice.

29:16.856 --> 29:18.077
Ihab doesn't want to talk.

29:18.213 --> 29:19.412
He wants his turn,

29:19.591 --> 29:21.638
and that's not going to happen.

29:23.443 --> 29:25.469
You must be worried.

29:25.839 --> 29:27.865
Otherwise, you are not here.

29:28.278 --> 29:32.614
I'm worried about the price
we'll have to pay for either side to win.

29:32.728 --> 29:36.670
There's a book I-I read
about apartheid in South Africa.

29:36.791 --> 29:38.963
A white man says about the blacks,

29:39.105 --> 29:40.725
"my greatest fear"

29:40.828 --> 29:43.808
"is that by the time we have come to love,"

29:43.858 --> 29:45.929
"they will have come to hate."

29:46.400 --> 29:49.003
Have you come to love?

29:49.491 --> 29:51.400
I've come to talk.

29:52.221 --> 29:55.657
You and I have more in common
than anyone else in this.

29:55.767 --> 29:57.768
We're both exiled...

29:58.737 --> 30:01.845
for different reasons...
by force or by choice.

30:02.133 --> 30:06.139
But we both have the advantage
of an outsider's perspective.

30:07.235 --> 30:08.980
You came back.

30:09.589 --> 30:10.920
Why?

30:13.142 --> 30:17.101
To try and keep my brother
from making my father's mistakes.

30:17.917 --> 30:19.778
Finish with my brother

30:19.828 --> 30:22.111
what you started with my father.

30:22.253 --> 30:25.205
Negotiate a political solution.

30:28.146 --> 30:33.482
This is a young
man's fight.
And I need an old man

30:33.617 --> 30:36.919
to be my partner.
Someone who wants nothing for
himself.

30:37.053 --> 30:38.962
You think that's me?

30:39.019 --> 30:42.775
Well, I think we both have
a second chance here to make this right.

30:42.964 --> 30:45.207
You and I both know history.

30:45.353 --> 30:48.871
If we don't try, then your son or my brother

30:48.956 --> 30:50.430
and so many people along with them

30:50.480 --> 30:53.029
will be consumed by this.

30:53.876 --> 30:55.315
Imprisoned,

30:55.671 --> 30:57.483
exiled...

30:58.263 --> 31:01.342
or dead within a year.

31:02.856 --> 31:04.024
Death

31:04.963 --> 31:07.132
doesn't scare me...

31:08.343 --> 31:10.761
Bassam Al Fayeed.

31:11.288 --> 31:14.657
I've seen too much of it.

31:19.931 --> 31:21.516
I don't believe you.

31:22.253 --> 31:25.158
After 20 years, you're still alive.

31:26.954 --> 31:28.251
I'm a doctor.

31:28.301 --> 31:31.903
I believe that life itself is hope.

31:34.878 --> 31:37.179
And I think that you do, too.

32:12.732 --> 32:14.690
You didn't close the deal.

32:16.296 --> 32:18.695
Thought it was going
in the right direction.

32:19.023 --> 32:21.465
He... just said he needed to sleep on it.

32:21.992 --> 32:23.719
But when he woke up...

32:25.827 --> 32:30.548
Well, you may have failed,
but, uh, the reach...

32:31.701 --> 32:33.204
It was impressive.

32:34.478 --> 32:37.177
Get in. I'll take you back to the Palace.

33:28.490 --> 33:30.680
General...

33:32.051 --> 33:34.015
Clear the Plaza.

33:50.939 --> 33:53.035
They're moving into the Plaza.

33:53.420 --> 33:55.065
After your speech,

33:55.161 --> 33:57.443
there's a van waiting for you.

33:59.881 --> 34:01.211
Ihab.

34:01.890 --> 34:04.234
So, when they start shooting,

34:04.432 --> 34:08.219
you won't be standing with the people?

34:10.491 --> 34:14.594
Free Abbudin!

34:14.728 --> 34:19.433
Free Abbudin!

34:19.659 --> 34:20.481
Samira.

34:21.091 --> 34:23.438
- Let's go before it's too late.
- I'm not leaving.

34:23.562 --> 34:24.690
You would die for him?

34:24.757 --> 34:27.678
Ihab may be trying
to replace one tyranny with another.

34:27.940 --> 34:29.408
But the people...

34:29.846 --> 34:31.351
they won't let him.

34:31.646 --> 34:34.081
And I'm standing here with them.

34:37.085 --> 34:39.286
I'll stand with you.

34:48.329 --> 34:50.230
Thank you for coming.

34:52.800 --> 34:54.284
How can you do this?

34:54.598 --> 34:56.400
You're feeding her to the wolves.

34:56.467 --> 34:58.304
It's not like we have a choice.

34:58.397 --> 35:00.536
She's our daughter.

35:01.530 --> 35:04.018
Hakim. What happened to you?

35:04.068 --> 35:05.037
It's nothing.

35:05.126 --> 35:06.931
A hunting accident.

35:07.177 --> 35:08.765
And yet you're here.

35:08.971 --> 35:11.471
What one does for family.

35:11.953 --> 35:14.087
Nusrat.

35:20.414 --> 35:22.768
Beautiful as ever.

35:23.537 --> 35:24.952
It's all for you.

35:25.221 --> 35:26.666
Everything here...

35:26.841 --> 35:29.141
- Is all for you.
- Nusrat.

35:36.582 --> 35:39.167
Everything's going to be okay.

35:42.798 --> 35:44.618
Come. Let's greet everyone.

35:44.668 --> 35:45.661
Okay.

35:47.989 --> 35:49.827
Enjoy the party.

35:50.158 --> 35:52.485
Look at the newlyweds.

35:54.405 --> 35:56.863
What a persuasive man.

36:10.715 --> 36:13.079
You were right.

36:18.619 --> 36:23.023
Why did I think I could come here
and do something my father couldn't?

36:30.265 --> 36:35.435
Thank you... for putting your
life on hold for me.

36:38.272 --> 36:40.373
Being here with me.

36:46.184 --> 36:49.498
I think
I really needed to hear that.

37:02.930 --> 37:05.410
Free Abbudin!
Free Abbudin!

37:05.460 --> 37:07.909
Raise your phones!

37:08.440 --> 37:11.761
Record this moment in history!

37:13.606 --> 37:16.144
As long as we have a camera,

37:16.194 --> 37:20.075
the revolution continues!

37:20.303 --> 37:25.953
And if... if we are
the first martyrs to liberate Abbudin,

37:26.046 --> 37:28.955
then so be it!

37:33.832 --> 37:39.066
- I stand with you, my brothers and sisters.
- Free Abbudin!

37:39.116 --> 37:40.789
I stand with you,

37:40.864 --> 37:44.436
united... united... unite...

38:43.377 --> 38:45.293
Brothers...

38:45.731 --> 38:47.539
and sisters.

38:48.031 --> 38:50.740
20 years in exile,

38:51.605 --> 38:56.076
but I have come home.

39:06.120 --> 39:08.254
Your brother is back.

39:13.235 --> 39:15.261
Excuse me.

39:27.875 --> 39:28.729
Liar.

39:30.467 --> 39:36.530
You told me you were going
to meet Ihab Rashid.

39:37.370 --> 39:39.048
I trusted you.

39:39.959 --> 39:44.289
You are my blood, and you betrayed me.

39:44.584 --> 39:46.692
- Jamal.
- No, Molly.

39:46.742 --> 39:48.861
If your husband is a traitor,

39:48.996 --> 39:51.039
- I need to know.
- He's not a traitor.

39:51.089 --> 39:52.851
He deceived the president.

39:52.947 --> 39:54.542
Threatened our national security.

39:54.620 --> 39:56.468
Mr. President.

39:57.590 --> 40:02.019
General. Uh, you need to see something.

40:12.629 --> 40:14.266
Willing to put aside

40:14.341 --> 40:19.486
the atrocities of the past,
to join our cause.

40:19.682 --> 40:21.437
I demand

40:21.725 --> 40:26.965
to sit down with president
Jamal Al Fayeed.

40:27.020 --> 40:29.173
He demands?

40:29.715 --> 40:32.221
Free Abbudin!

40:32.368 --> 40:34.673
Free Abbudin!

40:34.809 --> 40:41.214
Free Abbudin! Free Abbudin!

40:42.087 --> 40:43.564
This is it.

40:45.092 --> 40:47.345
You can finish something our father couldn't.

40:47.424 --> 40:49.457
Pardon the Sheik and sit down with him.

40:49.546 --> 40:51.657
This is insane.

40:51.792 --> 40:53.630
Our soldiers are in place,

40:53.680 --> 40:56.261
- awaiting your order.
- Then stand them down.

40:56.656 --> 41:01.217
Jamal, you can end this without firing a shot.

41:03.174 --> 41:05.166
This is what you wanted.

41:06.807 --> 41:07.811
Is it?

41:19.482 --> 41:21.675
General, tell your men to stand down.

41:22.005 --> 41:23.871
But, Mr. President...

41:25.004 --> 41:28.034
