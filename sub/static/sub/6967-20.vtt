WEBVTT

00:05.805 --> 00:07.534
You're supposed to be in charge, Perkins.

00:07.607 --> 00:09.734
- I am in charge.
- These men want answers.

00:09.843 --> 00:12.937
What's your plan?
This thing could kill us all.

00:13.046 --> 00:16.504
We should've been gone two days ago.
No one would listen to me.

00:16.616 --> 00:19.676
Nobody knew what it was then.
Nobody knows now.

00:19.753 --> 00:23.814
- Somebody has to go for help.
- What about the rest of us? What do we do?

00:23.890 --> 00:27.826
- Just wait here till help arrives?
- One of us has to hike out!

00:27.894 --> 00:32.092
That person might not make it
down to the road before nightfall!

00:32.165 --> 00:34.827
Then what? I say we make a run for it.

00:34.901 --> 00:38.962
- Split up. Take our chances.
- It's suicide, Dyer.

00:39.072 --> 00:40.403
Fine.

00:40.473 --> 00:43.237
You stay here, tell us how it turns out.

00:45.000 --> 00:51.074
Advertise your product or brand here

01:14.774 --> 01:16.969
You're going the wrong way!

01:38.298 --> 01:41.529
- I think it's broken.
- Come on, you gotta get up!

01:41.601 --> 01:44.126
I don't think I can make it.

01:48.541 --> 01:50.600
We gotta keep moving!

01:52.112 --> 01:54.171
We're not gonna make it!

02:58.211 --> 03:01.476
- Take a good look, Scully.
- What am I looking at?

03:01.581 --> 03:05.984
30 loggers working a clear-cutting
contract in Washington State.

03:06.052 --> 03:09.044
Rugged, manly men
in the full bloom of manhood.

03:09.122 --> 03:11.113
But what am I looking for?

03:11.257 --> 03:15.057
Anything strange, unexplainable,
unlikely... boyfriend?

03:15.128 --> 03:17.926
I don't know. I give up, Mulder.

03:18.031 --> 03:22.127
You give up? That's what
the Federal Forest Service has done.

03:22.268 --> 03:25.237
- What happened to them?
- They vanished.

03:25.305 --> 03:27.398
Or so it would appear.

03:28.908 --> 03:31.502
This is Doug Spinney and Steven Teague.

03:31.611 --> 03:35.741
They're monkey-wrenchers, the guys
who sabotage logging equipment

03:35.848 --> 03:38.749
and make life miserable for lumberjacks.

03:38.851 --> 03:43.288
Eco-terrorists
or militant environmentalists.

03:43.356 --> 03:46.484
Two weeks ago,
the loggers radioed a message

03:46.559 --> 03:49.460
that Spinney and Teague
had gone on a spree...

03:49.529 --> 03:52.828
...sabotaging equipment,
causing general mischief.

03:52.899 --> 03:56.096
One week later,
radio communication was cut off.

03:56.169 --> 03:58.467
- Do they know why?
- No.

03:58.538 --> 04:02.770
The lumber company asked
the Federal Forest Service to look into it.

04:02.875 --> 04:06.242
Two officials were sent in.
No one's heard from them.

04:06.346 --> 04:09.941
The monkey-wrenchers are doing
more than mischief-making.

04:10.049 --> 04:13.041
That's what the Federal Forest Service think.

04:13.119 --> 04:17.954
They've asked the FBI to investigate.
I had to pull strings to get the case.

04:18.057 --> 04:21.151
For an eco-terrorism case?
Do I dare ask why?

04:21.261 --> 04:23.786
In 1934, long before anyone knew

04:23.896 --> 04:26.763
what an eco-terrorist was, a WPA crew

04:26.866 --> 04:29.892
working that area vanished without a trace.

04:29.969 --> 04:33.336
Not one of those men was ever found
or heard from again.

04:33.406 --> 04:35.806
And you suspect - what? - Bigfoot?

04:35.908 --> 04:40.208
Not likely. That's a lot of flannel
to choke down even for Bigfoot!

04:41.981 --> 04:46.281
Come on, Scully,
it'll be a nice trip to the forest.

05:12.412 --> 05:14.209
Hi.

05:14.314 --> 05:16.976
Fox Mulder and Dana Scully.
We're with the FBI.

05:17.517 --> 05:22.147
Larry Moore, Federal Forest Service.
You can put your gear in the back.

05:23.423 --> 05:24.913
Must be pretty rugged where we're going.

05:24.991 --> 05:26.458
Yeah.

05:27.293 --> 05:28.920
Is that a bullet hole in your windshield?

05:28.995 --> 05:32.123
- .22 calibre.
- Somebody take a shot at you?

05:32.198 --> 05:34.758
That's what it would appear.

05:34.834 --> 05:37.667
- Not much to hunt here, except Freddies.
- Freddies?

05:37.770 --> 05:41.763
The Federal Forest Service.
It's what eco-terrorists call us.

05:41.841 --> 05:44.366
Is that who you think took a shot at you?

05:44.477 --> 05:46.536
Let me get this outta the way.

05:46.612 --> 05:49.979
I have no quarrel with eco-terrorists
in principle.

05:50.049 --> 05:54.281
I'm as concerned for this forest
and the environment as anybody.

05:54.387 --> 05:56.617
It's their methods I can't condone.

05:56.689 --> 05:59.157
Would they go so far as to kill a man?

05:59.225 --> 06:03.992
There's 30 men up there unaccounted for,
each with survival experience.

06:04.063 --> 06:06.156
Something happened to 'em.

06:08.267 --> 06:11.600
Sorry I'm late.
I was talking to Bob Perkins' wife.

06:12.772 --> 06:15.536
He's one of our missing loggers.
Hello, Larry.

06:15.608 --> 06:17.838
Steve Humphreys, head of security
for Schiff-lmmergut Lumber.

06:17.910 --> 06:20.071
Mulder, Scully.

06:20.179 --> 06:24.513
We've got a four-hour drive.
Plenty of time to get to know each other.

06:25.852 --> 06:30.050
Get the impression we've walked into
the middle of a war that's already started?

06:40.032 --> 06:42.865
Why do these men work
so far up in the wilderness?

06:42.935 --> 06:45.631
- That's where the trees are.
- You're kidding, right?

06:45.705 --> 06:49.869
No, environmentalists have made sure
the land is untouchable.

06:49.942 --> 06:52.274
Force us to take timber where we can.

06:52.345 --> 06:55.041
We plant saplings for every tree we take.

06:55.114 --> 06:57.548
So why do the eco-terrorists target you?

06:57.650 --> 07:00.710
These tree-huggers are the same kinda boys

07:00.820 --> 07:05.280
who went up to Canada during
the Vietnam war. They're cowardly.

07:06.659 --> 07:07.751
Dammit!

07:09.128 --> 07:13.258
Homemade tire spike -
clear through the sidewall. It's unfixable.

07:13.332 --> 07:15.823
- You got a spare, don't you?
- Right tire's history, too.

07:17.036 --> 07:19.027
The monkey-wrenchers call it a caltrop.

07:19.105 --> 07:21.369
The roads are littered with them.

07:21.474 --> 07:25.843
Indiscriminate. Imagine somebody
spiking Washington DC's roads.

07:25.912 --> 07:28.881
Like to see how much sympathy
they'd get then!

07:28.948 --> 07:31.280
So how are we gonna get up to the camp?

07:31.350 --> 07:33.443
We're gonna have to hike.

08:29.976 --> 08:32.034
Anybody here?

08:38.017 --> 08:39.541
Someone forgot to clean their plate.

08:40.019 --> 08:42.817
It looks like they left in a hurry, too.

08:51.330 --> 08:53.389
They forgot to pack.

09:00.106 --> 09:02.131
- Find anything?
- Party favors.

09:02.208 --> 09:05.268
Vehicles have been monkey-wrenched.
Generator's busted.

09:05.378 --> 09:07.778
Somebody turned this place upside down.

09:07.847 --> 09:10.577
And they didn't want the fact broadcast.

09:21.093 --> 09:23.357
The radiators are all full of rice.

09:23.429 --> 09:27.456
Sugar or sand in all the crankcases.
They really did a number here.

09:27.567 --> 09:30.229
The sun's going down in an hour and a half.

09:30.303 --> 09:32.396
Better look around before dark.

09:32.471 --> 09:35.406
I'll see if I can get that generator working.

09:35.474 --> 09:38.409
- You were right about one thing.
- What's that?

09:38.477 --> 09:40.570
It definitely wasn't Bigfoot.

10:01.233 --> 10:02.666
Look at that!

10:03.703 --> 10:05.830
What is it?

10:07.807 --> 10:09.741
It looks like a hive.

10:09.809 --> 10:13.301
- Maybe a cocoon of some kind.
- Made by what?

10:13.412 --> 10:15.642
I don't know. I've never seen anything like it.

10:25.057 --> 10:27.082
Got it.

10:27.159 --> 10:31.118
- Can you cut it down?
- Yeah, I think so.

10:42.041 --> 10:44.475
You all right, Scully?

11:10.503 --> 11:11.527
Oh, God!

11:20.379 --> 11:24.076
It feels... it feels desiccated, hard and dry,

11:24.150 --> 11:26.118
almost preserved.

11:26.185 --> 11:28.517
Like it's been embalmed.

11:28.587 --> 11:32.887
No, more like all the fluids
have been bled from its body.

11:32.992 --> 11:35.290
Almost like it's been cured.

11:35.361 --> 11:37.192
I think...

11:37.296 --> 11:39.287
it's a male.

11:39.365 --> 11:40.832
Barely.

11:40.966 --> 11:44.163
I'd say it's some kind of spider's nest

11:44.236 --> 11:46.431
or insect cocoon.

11:46.539 --> 11:51.374
What kind of insect could have gotten
a man all the way up into that tree?

11:51.444 --> 11:53.935
Ltsy-bitsy spider.

12:53.906 --> 12:55.464
Don't move!

12:56.375 --> 12:57.433
Who are you?

13:01.814 --> 13:04.442
Doug Spinney.
I ought to shoot you where you stand.

13:04.517 --> 13:06.417
Might as well shoot yourself.

13:06.485 --> 13:08.476
You're in a helluva spot to test me.

13:08.587 --> 13:11.385
- What happened to my men?
- What men?

13:11.457 --> 13:13.789
The men who were working this camp.

13:15.728 --> 13:19.494
I don't know. The same thing that'll
happen to us when the sun goes down.

13:19.598 --> 13:22.863
- What are you doing?
- This animal's Doug Spinney.

13:22.935 --> 13:25.665
He's responsible for the monkey-wrenching.

13:25.738 --> 13:28.229
- Probably a murderer.
- I'm no murderer.

13:28.307 --> 13:30.901
- Liar!
- Let's hear what he has to say.

13:31.010 --> 13:34.707
If we stand around here talking,
there'll be nothing left to say.

13:34.814 --> 13:37.009
I'd get that generator started.

13:37.082 --> 13:38.913
Darkness is our enemy.

13:39.018 --> 13:41.043
What's he talking about?

13:41.153 --> 13:43.451
Someone wanna give me a hand?

13:43.522 --> 13:45.888
He's giving orders? I fixed the damn thing!

13:45.958 --> 13:48.051
Hey, it's all right.

13:56.869 --> 13:59.667
Why did you say
the darkness was our enemy?

14:00.840 --> 14:02.865
That's when they come.

14:02.942 --> 14:07.072
- When who comes?
- I don't know what it is.

14:07.179 --> 14:09.238
They come from the sky.

14:09.315 --> 14:12.375
They take a man off his feet
and devour him alive.

14:12.484 --> 14:15.476
- I saw it happen.
- Happen to who?

14:19.291 --> 14:22.385
I need to eat. I haven't eaten in three days.

14:26.265 --> 14:29.757
What kinda BS story is that, huh?
You believe that?

14:31.003 --> 14:33.904
- We found something in the forest.
- What?

14:34.874 --> 14:37.240
A man caught in some kind of insect cocoon.

14:42.081 --> 14:46.313
- What happened here?
- We're camped two valleys over.

14:46.385 --> 14:50.082
- Four of us, three now.
- More rats in the woodpile.

14:52.925 --> 14:54.256
Our truck has a dead battery,

14:54.326 --> 14:57.591
so we drew straws to see who'd hike here
to steal one from the loggers.

14:57.696 --> 15:01.097
- Why notjust hike out?
- It's more than a day's hike.

15:01.166 --> 15:03.760
No way we'd want to be caught out after dark.

15:03.836 --> 15:06.100
Not after what happened to Teague.

15:06.171 --> 15:08.537
The man you said was devoured alive?

15:08.607 --> 15:10.006
Yeah.

15:10.109 --> 15:13.806
- What are you guys doing out here?
- Camping.

15:13.913 --> 15:16.746
The kind of camping you do
is a federal offense.

15:16.815 --> 15:19.010
- Hold off a second.
- He's right.

15:20.419 --> 15:23.786
This man's a felon.
He could be placed under arrest.

15:23.856 --> 15:26.950
What about your offense, my friend?

15:27.026 --> 15:29.051
The offense against nature!

15:29.161 --> 15:33.621
We operate within the law.
We pay for the right to take those trees.

15:33.732 --> 15:38.829
Oh, yeah? Your logging crew is taking trees
that nobody has a right to.

15:38.938 --> 15:43.534
Trees that are marked! So don't talk
to me about breaking the law, sir!

15:43.609 --> 15:46.840
- They've been taking marked trees?
- Yes, sir. Marked in orange.

15:46.946 --> 15:50.438
Old-growth trees?
Know anything about that, Steve?

15:51.684 --> 15:53.584
No.

15:56.055 --> 15:58.546
Gonna take this man's word over mine?

16:01.961 --> 16:06.398
You don't wanna go out in the night.
Take my word on that.

16:07.399 --> 16:09.424
It's out there.

16:09.501 --> 16:14.700
If I go out, somebody will attack me,
eat me alive and spin me in its web?

16:14.807 --> 16:16.775
Yes.

16:16.842 --> 16:20.300
It's too polite to come in here and get me?

16:20.446 --> 16:23.279
For some reason, it's afraid of the light.

16:23.415 --> 16:27.977
- It's afraid of the light!
- There may be something to it.

16:28.053 --> 16:31.819
He's a murderer and just clever enough
to make up that story.

16:31.890 --> 16:34.882
Even to whip up that cocoon
to save a few trees.

16:34.994 --> 16:37.519
And I'm gonna prove I'm right.

16:40.065 --> 16:42.124
This is ridiculous!

16:49.308 --> 16:51.333
Where is it, Spinney?

16:51.477 --> 16:54.469
I thought it was gonna come

16:54.546 --> 16:57.037
and devour me!

16:58.017 --> 16:59.348
Hey, here I am!

17:02.488 --> 17:04.854
Come out, come out, wherever you are!

17:07.226 --> 17:09.251
Don't be shy.

17:09.328 --> 17:11.421
Come on!

17:13.766 --> 17:18.362
It's just like I told you.
There's nothing out here but a bunch of trees.

17:18.503 --> 17:21.301
Trees this man values more than human life.

17:21.373 --> 17:24.171
I'm gonna see him tried on murder charges.

17:27.913 --> 17:29.938
What do you think?

17:30.049 --> 17:33.883
I think I'm gonna suggest
that we sleep with the lights on.

17:58.210 --> 18:00.075
See this Douglas fir?

18:00.145 --> 18:03.740
It's been here since before time
and your men cut it down.

18:03.816 --> 18:06.580
- Who marks these trees?
- Federal Forest Service.

18:06.685 --> 18:10.121
You're only supposed to cut trees
marked with a blue X.

18:10.189 --> 18:12.680
This tree must be hundreds of years old.

18:12.758 --> 18:15.386
You must get a lot of lumber from a big tree.

18:15.494 --> 18:19.988
Thousands of board feet.
Helluva lot easier than taking smaller trees.

18:20.099 --> 18:24.035
Monkey-wrenchers like Spinney
are not above marking trees.

18:24.136 --> 18:26.900
This tree's 500 years old if it's a day, Steve.

18:26.972 --> 18:28.837
Look at this.

18:30.042 --> 18:32.135
What would this represent?

18:34.813 --> 18:38.374
I don't know.
I've never seen a ring like that before.

18:38.450 --> 18:40.975
Those center rings are the older rings?

18:41.053 --> 18:43.817
Every ring represents a season of growth.

18:43.922 --> 18:47.551
You see these? These are 500, 600 years old.

18:47.659 --> 18:51.117
They're a recorded history
of rainfall and climate.

18:51.196 --> 18:55.155
But this one I don't know.
I should take a core sample.

18:55.234 --> 18:59.534
We finished this nature walk?
I wanna know what happened to the loggers.

18:59.638 --> 19:03.335
- We're determining that, sir.
- Looking at a tree stump?

19:03.408 --> 19:06.536
- Interrogate this man.
- I don't think he did it.

19:06.645 --> 19:09.375
- I want him arrested.
- He's not going anywhere.

19:09.448 --> 19:13.680
Not with a gun on him.
What happens if his three buddies show up

19:13.785 --> 19:15.810
and do to you what they did

19:15.888 --> 19:18.379
to those Federal Forest officials?

19:18.457 --> 19:20.789
I just wanna take a core sample.

19:20.859 --> 19:24.488
I got families who want answers
about loved ones and so do you!

19:24.596 --> 19:26.962
Answers that won't be found in that tree!

19:27.032 --> 19:29.694
The only crime is the death of that tree.

19:29.801 --> 19:31.996
We'll see about that.

19:35.574 --> 19:38.304
- Where are you going?
- Down to your truck.

19:38.410 --> 19:42.312
I'll get on the horn and get people
up here who'll take some action.

19:42.414 --> 19:44.439
- Steve!
- Let him go.

19:44.516 --> 19:46.814
Let him find out for himself.

19:52.257 --> 19:54.248
This is odd.

19:54.760 --> 19:58.890
This yellow ring's got something living in it.
Some kind of...

19:59.064 --> 20:00.793
tiny bug.

20:00.866 --> 20:02.857
It doesn't make sense.

20:02.935 --> 20:04.425
Why not?

20:04.503 --> 20:07.939
Well, parasites attack a tree
in a variety of ways,

20:08.040 --> 20:10.873
but they always attack the living parts.

20:10.943 --> 20:13.878
The leaves, the roots, the new growth rings.

20:15.347 --> 20:17.474
Even if they're borers of some kind,

20:17.549 --> 20:19.141
they wouldn't work so deep.

20:19.251 --> 20:21.617
They seem to be feeding on this ring's wood.

20:21.687 --> 20:23.678
Can you identify them?

20:23.822 --> 20:27.053
It's a wood mite of some kind.
Nothing I've ever seen.

20:27.125 --> 20:29.252
Can they have been there centuries?

20:29.328 --> 20:33.560
I don't see how.
These inner rings are essentially dead wood.

20:33.665 --> 20:37.897
The tree's vascular system
is limited to the outer few rings.

20:37.970 --> 20:40.029
They need water to survive.

20:40.105 --> 20:42.938
They appear to be hatching
out of the porous wood.

20:44.443 --> 20:48.436
Maybe when you drilled this core,
you tapped into a larger nest.

20:48.513 --> 20:50.174
Can they build a cocoon?

20:51.683 --> 20:55.050
Right after that tree was cut down
was when Teague died.

20:55.120 --> 20:58.715
It's about the same time
when the loggers disappeared.

20:58.857 --> 21:00.722
You think these mites killed them?

21:00.859 --> 21:05.319
Maybe they were dormant for hundreds
of years. Maybe they woke up hungry.

21:32.924 --> 21:34.755
Dammit!

22:22.240 --> 22:24.936
All right, you monkey-wrenchers,
come on out!

22:29.781 --> 22:32.181
I know what you're up to!

24:15.720 --> 24:18.382
Humphreys should've been back by now.

24:18.490 --> 24:20.720
These bugs aren't moving any more.

24:20.792 --> 24:23.488
They're either dead or they're asleep.

24:23.562 --> 24:25.689
They don't like the light.

24:25.764 --> 24:29.791
That's weird.
Usually bugs are attracted to light.

24:29.901 --> 24:33.359
These obviously are not your ordinary bugs.

24:33.472 --> 24:35.565
To say the least.

24:35.674 --> 24:41.306
- What do you know about insects?
- Just what I learned in biology courses.

24:41.379 --> 24:44.473
That they're the foundation
of our ecosystem,

24:44.549 --> 24:46.574
that there are lots of them:

24:46.685 --> 24:48.744
200 million per person on Earth.

24:48.820 --> 24:52.950
- And they've been around a long time, right?
- About 600 million years.

24:53.024 --> 24:55.151
Even before the dinosaurs. Why?

24:55.227 --> 24:58.094
And this tree is what? 5, 6, 700 years old?

24:58.196 --> 24:59.527
Yeah.

24:59.598 --> 25:02.328
And these rings represent climatic changes.

25:02.400 --> 25:06.097
So in this year or season
in the life of the tree,

25:06.204 --> 25:09.196
a strange event produced an abnormal ring.

25:09.307 --> 25:12.174
- Like what, exactly?
- A volcanic eruption.

25:12.244 --> 25:17.181
This chain of mountains running from
Washington to Oregon is still active.

25:17.249 --> 25:21.379
- Remember Mount St Helens?
- How does that explain the bugs?

25:21.453 --> 25:25.048
After Mount St Helens erupted,
radiation was unleashed

25:25.156 --> 25:27.147
from inside the Earth.

25:27.259 --> 25:29.523
Strange things started to grow.

25:29.594 --> 25:33.052
They discovered an ameba
that can suck a man's brains out.

25:33.164 --> 25:35.223
A brain-sucking ameba!

25:35.333 --> 25:39.963
It's true. In Spirit Lake,
there's cases of swimmers being infected.

25:40.038 --> 25:42.233
A single-celled ameba can be mutated.

25:42.340 --> 25:48.074
But an insect is complex. A mutation
would take years and years to evolve.

25:48.179 --> 25:51.740
Maybe what we're dealing with
isn't a mutation at all.

25:51.816 --> 25:56.344
What if it's some kind of
extinct insect larvae in that ring,

25:56.421 --> 26:00.983
deposited during volcanic activity,
brought up through the root system?

26:01.059 --> 26:03.084
Ancient insect eggs,

26:03.194 --> 26:07.460
thousands, maybe millions of years old,
lying dormant until...

26:07.566 --> 26:10.467
Until those loggers cut down that tree.

26:10.569 --> 26:13.629
That would be poetic justice, don't you think?

26:13.705 --> 26:16.833
Unleashing the thing
that would end up killing them.

26:16.908 --> 26:19.001
And your friend Humphreys.

26:20.378 --> 26:23.211
And, who knows... maybe us.

26:25.083 --> 26:26.983
Sweet dreams.

26:31.022 --> 26:35.118
Humphreys might've just hiked outta here.
We don't know he didn't.

26:35.226 --> 26:39.788
Maybe we're letting ourselves get
carried away with this bug story.

26:39.864 --> 26:41.923
Yeah, maybe.

27:33.785 --> 27:35.844
Going somewhere?

27:35.920 --> 27:38.184
- No, I was...
- Doing an auto repair.

27:38.289 --> 27:41.122
Looks like you're planning on cutting out.

27:41.192 --> 27:46.186
I got to save my friends. They could only
keep their generator going 15, 20 hours max.

27:46.297 --> 27:49.323
- They're gonna die.
- So why are you sneaking around?

27:49.467 --> 27:53.528
The Forest Service guy wouldn't go for it.
He'd never trust me.

27:53.605 --> 27:56.096
He's got no reason to. Neither do I.

27:56.174 --> 27:59.905
I can save us all, man.
We've got ajeep just two valleys over.

27:59.978 --> 28:03.436
All it needs is a battery.
I could be back in the morning.

28:03.548 --> 28:05.607
We can all drive out tomorrow.

28:08.887 --> 28:10.912
You gotta trust me, man.

28:20.765 --> 28:22.824
Radio's back up.

28:27.038 --> 28:28.938
It's working?

28:29.007 --> 28:32.135
I'm not getting any reception,
so the receiver could be trashed.

28:32.210 --> 28:34.804
And transmissions?
Can you send a message?

28:34.913 --> 28:36.938
We could try.

28:37.015 --> 28:40.974
This is a call for help.
Is there anyone at this frequency?

28:46.725 --> 28:48.955
This is Special Agent Mulder, FBI.

28:49.027 --> 28:54.829
We have an emergency and a possible
quarantine situation. Our position is...

29:03.241 --> 29:05.402
- What happened to the generator?
- I turned it off.

29:05.477 --> 29:08.105
Turn it back on. I got the radio working.

29:08.179 --> 29:11.410
- What happened to the gas can?
- Spinney took it.

29:12.250 --> 29:15.151
He took it? You mean he's gone?

29:15.220 --> 29:19.088
He took a battery and some gas.
He'll come back in the morning.

29:19.190 --> 29:21.488
He gave you his personal guarantee?

29:21.626 --> 29:23.821
He gave me his word, yeah.

29:23.895 --> 29:26.159
The man who gave you his word

29:26.231 --> 29:29.667
has made an art out of sabotage
and defying authority.

29:29.768 --> 29:33.636
He's probably the same man
who put a bullet through my windshield.

29:33.705 --> 29:36.902
At least now we've got one chance
of getting out alive.

29:37.008 --> 29:39.238
One more chance than we had before.

29:39.310 --> 29:41.505
- Or one less.
- What do you mean?

29:41.646 --> 29:44.513
Mulder let him leave with the last of the gas.

29:44.649 --> 29:47.709
This generator's got a quarter tank left.

29:47.819 --> 29:49.719
What about the trucks?

29:49.821 --> 29:52.813
Their tanks were ruptured or filled with sugar.

29:52.891 --> 29:56.258
By the same man we are now trusting
to keep his word.

29:56.327 --> 29:59.626
Then we gotta get back on the radio,
send out a Mayday.

29:59.697 --> 30:03.656
Every drop of fuel we waste is fuel
that'll keep this genny powered tonight.

30:03.735 --> 30:07.796
I don't wanna be waiting around,
hoping somebody heard that transmission

30:07.872 --> 30:11.330
when this thing quits running
about two in the morning.

30:11.442 --> 30:13.501
Do you?

30:39.871 --> 30:41.896
- Mulder...
- Look, it's done.

30:41.973 --> 30:45.636
I shouldn't have let him go.
Let's just move past it, OK?

30:46.477 --> 30:47.910
Fine.

30:47.979 --> 30:50.072
What do you suggest?

30:51.082 --> 30:53.949
I don't know. We'll think of something.

30:55.587 --> 30:59.353
I think we have a pretty good idea
what happened to those loggers

30:59.424 --> 31:01.392
and what happened to the group in 1934.

31:01.492 --> 31:04.859
- They only found one cocoon.
- It's a very big forest.

31:04.929 --> 31:06.760
What would you have done?

31:06.865 --> 31:10.460
Would I have made a decision alone
that affected the group?

31:10.535 --> 31:12.469
Cut the sanctimonious crap!

31:12.537 --> 31:16.496
What do you want me to say?
Let's face it, we might die up here.

31:16.574 --> 31:19.407
They may find our bodies spun up in a tree,

31:19.510 --> 31:21.569
or they may not find us at all!

31:22.747 --> 31:26.683
You're right.
And we're wasting time arguing about it.

31:42.834 --> 31:46.099
- What are you gonna do?
- Button this place up.

31:46.170 --> 31:47.501
If we gotta spend the night in here,

31:47.572 --> 31:51.599
we gotta do everything we can
to make sure the bugs stay out there.

32:05.456 --> 32:09.017
Be careful with that.
It's the only bulb that works.

32:55.306 --> 32:57.035
I can see them.

33:00.311 --> 33:02.404
You guys, look at this.

33:07.819 --> 33:10.185
They're coming through the wall,

33:10.254 --> 33:12.722
down where it's dark, you see them?

33:19.597 --> 33:22.259
- They're on me!
- It's all right, Scully.

33:22.333 --> 33:24.733
- Scully, Scully...
- Get them off me!

33:24.836 --> 33:27.100
- Get them off me!
- Stand still!

33:27.205 --> 33:29.867
- Stop it, stop it!
- Can you see them?

33:30.008 --> 33:32.875
- Get them off me!
- They're notjust on you.

33:33.011 --> 33:35.445
That's what that greasy residue is.

33:35.513 --> 33:38.107
We were supposed to be safe in the light!

33:38.216 --> 33:41.481
We are! I think the light
keeps them from swarming.

33:41.552 --> 33:44.419
We'll be safe as long as we stay in the light.

34:13.117 --> 34:15.244
How are you feeling?

34:16.320 --> 34:18.185
I'm OK.

34:24.695 --> 34:26.719
They're oxidizing enzymes.

34:26.797 --> 34:28.891
Just like fireflies.

34:31.402 --> 34:34.268
Maybe that's why they cocoon their prey.

34:34.338 --> 34:38.900
So they can oxidize the proteins
taken from the fluids in the body.

34:45.183 --> 34:47.208
What if the generator goes?

34:47.318 --> 34:50.583
Are they gonna swarm in
and drain the life out of us?

34:50.688 --> 34:52.882
We got an hour and a half till sunrise.

34:52.956 --> 34:55.619
Then what? It's over a day's hike out of here.

34:55.726 --> 34:57.990
We won't make it on foot by nightfall.

34:58.129 --> 35:02.156
Maybe somebody heard our transmission.
Help could be on the way.

35:02.233 --> 35:07.500
You sent that call hours ago.
I mean, help would've been here by now.

35:09.107 --> 35:11.598
Well, I'm not gonna give up on Spinney.

35:12.443 --> 35:15.207
He gave me his word
he'd come back to get us.

35:15.313 --> 35:17.338
And if he doesn't?

35:18.382 --> 35:20.441
We'll think of something.

36:12.803 --> 36:14.771
You got a patch kit
or an extra tube in your truck?

36:14.839 --> 36:16.101
Yeah.

36:16.240 --> 36:19.869
Maybe we can patch this.
And with the spare in your truck,

36:19.977 --> 36:22.502
maybe we can limp down the mountain.

36:24.649 --> 36:28.676
If not, we can get on the radio
and warn them what's out there.

37:03.721 --> 37:05.814
- You see it?
- Yeah.

37:21.472 --> 37:23.064
Listen.

37:23.140 --> 37:25.165
You hear that?

37:25.309 --> 37:27.368
It's a car.

37:31.983 --> 37:34.076
No, it's ajeep!

37:37.788 --> 37:40.689
- We gotta move! Let's go, let's go!
- Wait!

37:40.758 --> 37:42.919
What about Humphreys' body?

37:43.794 --> 37:45.853
Leave it. I've radioed for help.

37:45.930 --> 37:49.593
- What happened to your friends?
- They didn't make it.

37:49.700 --> 37:54.660
We're not gonna make it either
unless we haul ass! Let's go!

38:34.412 --> 38:35.242
Dammit!

38:44.889 --> 38:46.550
I don't believe it!

38:46.624 --> 38:50.219
And you talk about
shooting yourself in the foot!

38:57.034 --> 38:59.502
Get outta there!
Get back in the car!

40:26.557 --> 40:28.718
Emergency evacuation situation.

40:28.826 --> 40:31.226
Requesting quarantine facility

40:31.295 --> 40:36.164
for two, possibly three victims
with undiagnosed infection

40:36.267 --> 40:39.327
or exposure to unknown biological vectors.

40:39.437 --> 40:43.635
Repeat, emergency evacuation situation:
Two, possibly...

40:48.479 --> 40:50.344
Attention all personnel.

40:50.448 --> 40:54.384
High-level bio-clearance
required on third floor.

41:33.958 --> 41:37.018
- How are you feeling?
- Better.

41:37.127 --> 41:39.152
How did the tests come back?

41:39.230 --> 41:41.528
Your respiratory charts were good.

41:41.599 --> 41:45.592
We were concerned about
the extent of damage through inhalation.

41:45.736 --> 41:49.331
There were large concentrations
of the chemical luciferin.

41:49.406 --> 41:50.839
Which is?

41:50.941 --> 41:54.900
The enzyme found in fireflies
and bioluminescent insects.

41:54.979 --> 41:58.847
Our entomologists
are trying to determine the specific epithet

41:58.949 --> 42:01.850
of the insects you encountered.

42:05.022 --> 42:05.920
Scully?

42:11.161 --> 42:12.423
How's she doing?

42:12.530 --> 42:16.591
She's still not out of the woods, so to speak.
She lost a lot of fluids.

42:16.734 --> 42:21.034
Two or three more hours of exposure,
she might not have made it.

42:21.138 --> 42:24.301
I told her it was gonna be
a nice trip to the forest.

42:29.446 --> 42:31.209
How are you gonna contain it to the forest?

42:32.883 --> 42:34.646
What if the swarm migrates?

42:34.785 --> 42:38.380
The government has initiated
eradication procedures.

42:38.455 --> 42:42.585
By using a combination of
controlled burns and pesticides,

42:42.660 --> 42:44.890
they will be successful.

42:44.995 --> 42:47.293
And if they're not?

42:50.100 --> 42:52.534
That is not an option, Mr Mulder.
