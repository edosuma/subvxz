WOMAN:
<i>The year is 2048.</i>

00:02.814 --> 00:06.688
<i>Evolving technologies</i>
<i>can no longer be regulated.</i>

00:06.721 --> 00:11.194
<i>Dangerous advancements forever</i>
<i>alter the criminal landscape.</i>

00:11.227 --> 00:13.732
<i>Police are not prepared.</i>

00:14.469 --> 00:17.006
<i>Law enforcement combats</i>
<i>this corruption</i>

00:17.039 --> 00:19.008
<i>with a new line of defense.</i>

00:20.651 --> 00:23.218
<i>But not all are created equal.</i>

00:25.253 --> 00:28.158
RUDY: <i>The idea behind the DRNs</i>
<i>was to be as human as possible.</i>

00:28.191 --> 00:31.695
<i>They were based on a program</i>
<i>called Synthetic Soul.</i>

00:31.728 --> 00:33.095
JOHN:
<i>That's one of the crazy ones.</i>

00:33.136 --> 00:34.769
- I'll lead you in?
- Let's go.

00:34.802 --> 00:38.344
WOMAN: <i>Now all cops...</i>
<i>human and manmade together...</i>

00:38.377 --> 00:41.681
<i>take on the battle</i>
<i>to watch over us all.</i>

00:49.367 --> 00:51.465
(alarm beeping)

00:55.053 --> 00:57.155
(sighs)

00:58.661 --> 01:01.669
? Wake up

01:01.702 --> 01:03.903
? It's the morning...

01:05.275 --> 01:07.448
FEMALE ELECTRONIC VOICE:
Charge at capacity.

01:07.481 --> 01:11.062
? Monday morning's coming on

01:14.869 --> 01:17.439
? The sun is shining down...

01:17.472 --> 01:20.379
(grinding, squeaking)

01:21.884 --> 01:27.098
? The sun is shining down

01:27.996 --> 01:29.968
? Sunlight

01:30.001 --> 01:34.451
? See the daybreak

01:36.193 --> 01:40.766
? Shake your bones,
lift your head ?

01:42.943 --> 01:44.976
? Look up

01:45.009 --> 01:49.523
? The sun is shining down...

01:49.556 --> 01:50.862
(squeaks)

01:50.895 --> 01:52.136
(stops squeaking)

01:52.169 --> 01:53.264
Hmm!

01:53.305 --> 01:57.412
? The sun is shining

01:57.445 --> 01:58.908
? Down.

02:02.647 --> 02:05.519
Hey.

02:05.552 --> 02:06.487
Hey, James.

02:06.520 --> 02:08.624
Morning, Mr. Navarro.
How you doing?

02:11.868 --> 02:12.797
Miss Miller.

02:12.838 --> 02:15.040
Oh. James.

02:15.073 --> 02:16.539
Left your key in
the lock again.

02:16.580 --> 02:18.515
Thank you.

02:18.548 --> 02:20.516
I swear my memory gets
worse every day.

02:20.549 --> 02:21.949
I told you, I can have
maintenance come in

02:21.982 --> 02:23.686
and switch those out for
bio locks if you'd like.

02:23.719 --> 02:26.890
That's all right, I prefer
the old-fashioned way.

02:26.930 --> 02:28.164
I'm funny, I guess.

02:28.197 --> 02:30.869
No, no, no, I like that.

02:32.366 --> 02:35.407
Uh, this came to the
security desk for you.

02:35.440 --> 02:36.471
Oh, thank you.

02:36.512 --> 02:38.409
I got to get back to the desk.

02:39.547 --> 02:40.986
See you.

02:42.000 --> 02:48.074
Advertise your product or brand here

02:50.100 --> 02:52.439
Hi, can I help you?

02:56.008 --> 02:57.311
What's your name?

02:57.344 --> 02:59.112
James.

03:02.154 --> 03:04.289
Let's go.

03:10.628 --> 03:12.731
(grunts)

03:36.470 --> 03:39.607
(beeping rapidly)

03:45.808 --> 03:47.586
DORIAN: <i>You know what I
love best about you?</i>

03:47.619 --> 03:48.747
<i>Your punctuality.</i>

03:48.788 --> 03:50.527
JOHN:
<i>What's that supposed to mean?</i>

03:50.560 --> 03:53.359
You're late and the car
smells like olive oil.

03:53.392 --> 03:57.095
Hold this... and this.

03:58.537 --> 04:00.399
What am I doing here?

04:00.432 --> 04:02.199
You're heating my coffee.

04:04.608 --> 04:06.704
Hey!

04:06.745 --> 04:07.745
I like it hot.

04:07.778 --> 04:11.420
It's best between 155
and 175 degrees.

04:11.453 --> 04:13.484
Most people prefer it at 175.

04:13.517 --> 04:17.791
You like it at 165,
and that's what it is.

04:17.825 --> 04:19.096
You know how I like my coffee?

04:19.129 --> 04:21.498
Yes, I, unlike you,
pay attention to details,

04:21.531 --> 04:23.138
like what time it is
and what time

04:23.171 --> 04:25.205
you're supposed to pick up
your partner for shift.

04:25.238 --> 04:26.573
Oh, I pay attention to details,

04:26.606 --> 04:29.110
like you just put your
finger in my coffee.

04:29.143 --> 04:30.678
If you'd like, I could
put it somewhere else.

04:30.711 --> 04:31.846
Wa-Wa-Wait, go back.

04:31.879 --> 04:33.680
- To where?
- To when I didn't have a partner

04:33.719 --> 04:35.383
and I could drive
to work in peace.

04:35.416 --> 04:37.951
I know you took my advice

04:37.991 --> 04:39.887
and used olive oil
on your leg, John,

04:39.920 --> 04:41.327
and it works.

04:41.360 --> 04:42.327
You're just too stubborn

04:42.360 --> 04:43.496
to say thank you,
but you're welcome.

04:43.529 --> 04:45.899
I ate a salad...
a Greek salad.

04:45.932 --> 04:47.036
At 10:00 a.m.?

04:47.069 --> 04:49.208
Boy, you're some detective.

04:49.241 --> 04:50.343
Finally.
Now you're talking.

04:50.376 --> 04:52.078
DISPATCHER:
13 RAY. Possible 31.

04:52.111 --> 04:53.078
Homicide.

04:53.111 --> 04:56.246
Body discovered
at 4500 Crescent Av.

04:56.279 --> 04:57.384
That's three blocks away.

04:57.417 --> 04:59.615
All right, let's go to work.

05:11.893 --> 05:14.332
How long you been here?

05:14.365 --> 05:16.131
We just got here.

05:16.164 --> 05:17.930
There were no witnesses
to the shooting.

05:17.963 --> 05:20.570
The incident happened
within the last 20 minutes.

05:20.604 --> 05:21.938
JOHN:
Who found him?

05:21.971 --> 05:24.074
These two, and we've
cordoned off the area.

05:25.107 --> 05:26.504
DORIAN:
They killed the cameras.

05:27.840 --> 05:30.203
I think I can still access
the archived footage.

05:35.671 --> 05:38.438
John...

05:49.609 --> 05:52.079
DORIAN:
They went up to the 25th floor.

05:55.488 --> 05:57.416
They shut down the elevator.

05:57.457 --> 05:59.627
Transmit that security
footage to Maldonado,

05:59.660 --> 06:02.659
so we can try and
I.D. these guys.

06:05.068 --> 06:07.603
Officer Harrison,
call for backup

06:07.636 --> 06:09.370
and begin evacuation protocols.

06:09.403 --> 06:10.666
- Yes, sir.
- And be careful.

06:10.699 --> 06:12.603
Perps are still
in the building.

06:12.636 --> 06:14.170
You got it.

06:21.813 --> 06:23.885
What's the plan?

06:23.918 --> 06:27.586
I got no idea...

06:27.619 --> 06:31.189
but we got 25 floors
to figure it out.

06:33.095 --> 06:34.968
(woman sobbing)

06:35.001 --> 06:37.473
MAN:
Hand over the phone.

06:37.506 --> 06:39.041
MAN 2:
Shut your mouth.

06:39.074 --> 06:40.337
MAN 1:
Hand it over.

06:40.370 --> 06:42.106
Stop talking.

06:42.139 --> 06:44.778
WOMAN:
Please don't hurt me.

06:44.811 --> 06:47.082
MAN 1: Let me see
it... hey, hey.

06:47.115 --> 06:48.049
I told you,

06:48.082 --> 06:49.182
you sit down.

06:49.215 --> 06:51.310
(clattering)

06:56.557 --> 06:59.660
(panting quietly)

07:12.451 --> 07:13.682
Hello.

07:15.114 --> 07:17.319
What's your name?

07:21.456 --> 07:25.158
Oh, you, you don't know
how to answer that, do you?

07:27.991 --> 07:31.570
You're afraid if you answer,
you'll get hurt, huh?

07:34.338 --> 07:38.408
Well... the only way
around that is...

07:38.441 --> 07:40.706
that you answer honestly.

07:42.843 --> 07:46.776
It's always the best policy.

07:48.711 --> 07:50.815
Jenna.

07:57.959 --> 08:00.624
Why don't you come
and join me, Jenna?

08:01.531 --> 08:03.637
(gasps)

08:06.342 --> 08:08.307
Yo.

08:08.340 --> 08:09.805
We can start now.

08:09.846 --> 08:11.511
Cops are still in the lobby.

08:11.544 --> 08:12.944
Well, that's their fault.

08:12.984 --> 08:15.248
It's time to get
their attention.

08:18.886 --> 08:20.391
(beeping rapidly)

08:24.990 --> 08:27.524
(screaming)

08:27.557 --> 08:29.260
Out of the way, out of the way.

08:29.293 --> 08:31.995
Stay down.

08:47.070 --> 08:48.878
(crewmen shouting)

08:50.513 --> 08:52.449
Police.
Keep moving.

08:52.482 --> 08:53.881
FEMALE VOICE:
This is not a drill.

08:53.914 --> 08:55.649
- What's going on? - Sir, we
need you to keep moving,

08:55.690 --> 08:57.983
continuing out of the building.

08:58.024 --> 08:59.622
- Go down the stairwell.
- What's going on out there?

08:59.655 --> 09:01.483
- Out of the building, please.
- Take the rest of the day off.

09:01.516 --> 09:04.187
Move to the stairs,
exit the back of the building.

09:05.092 --> 09:07.460
What's the update, Stahl?

09:07.493 --> 09:08.965
It's the Sanderson building
downtown.

09:08.998 --> 09:11.396
John's on the second floor
ascending.

09:11.429 --> 09:12.763
Ascending?

09:12.796 --> 09:13.764
John!

09:13.797 --> 09:14.964
What's your status?

09:14.997 --> 09:17.571
Dorian says the building
is still structurally sound.

09:17.604 --> 09:18.571
There's damage to the

09:18.604 --> 09:20.402
third and fourth
emergency exits.

09:20.435 --> 09:23.072
The southeast stairwell
is also blocked.

09:23.105 --> 09:24.745
Emergency personnel
are getting people out

09:24.777 --> 09:26.409
by the second story.

09:26.442 --> 09:27.977
John, do not ascend.

09:28.010 --> 09:29.177
Negative.

09:29.210 --> 09:30.815
Continue to direct the employees
to the second floor

09:30.848 --> 09:32.478
and go there yourself

09:32.511 --> 09:33.979
until we know
what we're dealing with here.

09:34.012 --> 09:35.252
I know what we're dealing with.

09:35.274 --> 09:36.344
The assailants
are still in the building.

09:36.377 --> 09:37.312
We're going after them.

09:37.345 --> 09:40.184
Buy me some time.

09:40.217 --> 09:41.680
You should initiate
the protocol.

09:41.713 --> 09:44.448
Jam all comm signals coming
in and out of the building,

09:44.488 --> 09:46.016
cut their communication,

09:46.057 --> 09:47.457
and get me some backup.

09:47.490 --> 09:48.723
John, if we jam

09:48.756 --> 09:50.858
the signal, comms won't
make it out of the building.

09:50.891 --> 09:53.760
We won't be able to communicate.

09:53.793 --> 09:56.097
Leave the building now.

09:56.130 --> 09:57.402
There's... I can't...

09:57.435 --> 09:58.571
What... do...

09:58.604 --> 10:00.140
Do you... (gibberish)

10:00.173 --> 10:02.476
Christmas.

10:02.509 --> 10:04.508
Did you just hang up
on Captain Maldonado?

10:04.541 --> 10:06.245
Yeah, boring
conversation anyway.

10:06.278 --> 10:08.751
I just love that you wear
your insubordination

10:08.784 --> 10:10.782
like it's a virtue.

10:10.815 --> 10:12.453
Did we evacuate the perimeter?

10:12.486 --> 10:14.957
Per protocol,
three-block radius.

10:17.590 --> 10:19.526
Yeah, this is Paul.

10:19.559 --> 10:21.599
Lock down communications.

10:23.169 --> 10:24.498
Initiate the jam.

10:24.539 --> 10:26.475
Sequence initiated.

10:26.509 --> 10:29.971
(rumbling, blipping,
electronic whirring)

10:32.978 --> 10:34.344
PAUL:
Okay, signal active.

10:34.377 --> 10:35.807
Switching to internal comms.

10:35.848 --> 10:38.344
They jammed us.

10:38.385 --> 10:41.119
All external communications
are blocked.

10:41.152 --> 10:44.821
Law enforcement is nothing
if not predictable.

10:44.854 --> 10:46.854
Alpha team, take the north side.

10:46.887 --> 10:48.727
Bravo team, take the rooftop.

10:48.760 --> 10:51.462
Hold your fire until instructed.

10:53.527 --> 10:55.629
Clear.

11:05.240 --> 11:07.312
Any more thoughts on that plan?

11:07.345 --> 11:09.145
We're running out
of floors, John.

11:09.178 --> 11:11.479
Well, I thought backup
would be here by now.

11:11.512 --> 11:13.845
Guess we just keep moving up.

11:13.878 --> 11:15.317
Maybe there's another option.

11:15.350 --> 11:16.485
The entire air system

11:16.518 --> 11:18.149
is interconnected.

11:18.182 --> 11:20.422
We just have to make it
to the 23rd floor.

11:20.455 --> 11:22.851
There's an access door
to the air system there that'll

11:22.892 --> 11:25.259
take us up to where these guys are.
See?

11:25.292 --> 11:28.228
Told you we'd
come up with a plan.

11:30.295 --> 11:32.166
Hey.

11:32.199 --> 11:33.566
What's with the disco face?

11:33.599 --> 11:35.366
Got something to tell me?

11:35.407 --> 11:37.303
Since the signals
are now being jammed,

11:37.344 --> 11:39.911
every emergency call
being placed in this building

11:39.944 --> 11:42.573
is bouncing back to me
because they can't get out.

11:42.614 --> 11:46.210
Answer the calls.
We might get some information.

11:46.243 --> 11:47.610
Hello?

11:47.643 --> 11:52.619
(woman speaking
foreign language)

11:52.652 --> 11:55.451
(speaking with woman's voice)

12:00.401 --> 12:02.338
What are you doing?

12:02.371 --> 12:04.138
In the Portuguese culture,
it is proven

12:04.171 --> 12:06.442
that people find
a woman's voice more soothing

12:06.475 --> 12:08.212
in moments of crisis.

12:08.245 --> 12:09.412
WOMAN:
Hello?

12:09.445 --> 12:10.748
(John's voice):
Hello.

12:10.782 --> 12:12.716
I'm Detective John Kennex.

12:12.748 --> 12:15.714
I'm an automated police officer
with a very difficult personality.

12:15.747 --> 12:17.282
WOMAN (crying):
911?

12:17.315 --> 12:18.755
Please remain calm.

12:18.788 --> 12:20.387
I'm-I'm trapped with a gunman.

12:20.420 --> 12:22.018
Please help.

12:22.059 --> 12:24.257
Everything's all right.
Just take a breath.

12:24.290 --> 12:25.489
What is your name?

12:25.522 --> 12:27.558
(quietly):
It's Paige.

12:27.591 --> 12:29.055
Hi, Paige.

12:30.161 --> 12:31.728
What can you tell me
about the gunmen?

12:31.762 --> 12:33.161
I don't know.

12:33.202 --> 12:36.830
They have my sister...

12:36.863 --> 12:38.269
(crying):
and others.

12:38.302 --> 12:39.501
Listen, Paige,

12:39.534 --> 12:40.702
I'm in the building.

12:40.735 --> 12:42.735
I need to ask you
a few questions,

12:42.776 --> 12:45.144
but first I need to know...
are you safe?

12:45.177 --> 12:47.745
Are you out of harm's way?

12:47.777 --> 12:49.080
I think so.

12:49.113 --> 12:51.312
- For now.
- Okay, listen to me.

12:51.352 --> 12:53.487
Where are you?
What floor are you on?

12:53.520 --> 12:55.414
I'm on the 25th floor.

12:55.455 --> 12:58.622
I'm in the utility closet.

12:58.655 --> 13:00.622
(door slams)

13:00.655 --> 13:02.823
MAN:
Next face.

13:02.864 --> 13:05.294
You, on your knees.

13:05.327 --> 13:06.764
On your knees!

13:06.797 --> 13:08.131
WOMAN:
Oh, no, no!

13:08.164 --> 13:09.594
Oh, God.

13:09.627 --> 13:10.993
(gunshot) (others screaming)

13:11.026 --> 13:12.962
(screaming, crying over comm)

13:12.995 --> 13:14.834
JOHN:
Paige?

13:14.867 --> 13:17.002
Paige, what's happening?

13:17.035 --> 13:18.938
They've shot him.

13:18.971 --> 13:21.673
Lou is dead.

13:21.706 --> 13:24.177
(people crying)

13:30.252 --> 13:32.683
Hey, dogface. Water.

13:32.716 --> 13:34.187
(indistinct radio communication)

13:34.220 --> 13:36.459
(glass shatters in distance)

13:38.693 --> 13:40.523
MAN:
We got a body!

13:40.564 --> 13:42.993
(officers shouting)

13:51.906 --> 13:53.737
MAN:
Keep those people back!

13:53.771 --> 13:57.175
MALDONADO: Those bastards.
What do they want?

13:59.071 --> 14:01.815
Detective Paul,
initiate hostage protocol.

14:01.848 --> 14:05.280
Send them the comm.
Send them the comm!

14:11.995 --> 14:14.276
Get that drone in the air.
We've got to start negotiating.

14:24.379 --> 14:26.577
BOONE:
Comm's here.

14:38.292 --> 14:39.762
What's your name?

14:39.795 --> 14:41.129
Captain Maldonado.

14:41.162 --> 14:42.791
And you are?

14:42.824 --> 14:44.693
Well, I'd tell you,
but I don't want

14:44.726 --> 14:46.195
to nullify your efforts.

14:46.228 --> 14:48.760
Now that we have
your attention...

14:48.793 --> 14:51.725
we have some demands.

14:52.988 --> 14:54.721
Paige, can you
hold the phone up

14:54.753 --> 14:56.759
so I can hear what's going on?

14:56.792 --> 15:00.190
I really hate to throw
out any more hostages.

15:00.231 --> 15:02.093
Let's get down
to brass tacks, huh?

15:02.126 --> 15:03.433
What do you want?

15:03.461 --> 15:04.628
First,

15:04.661 --> 15:07.500
get your snipers off the roof,
and tell those men

15:07.533 --> 15:09.701
you have assembled out front
to stand down,

15:09.734 --> 15:11.838
and keep them away
from the building,

15:11.871 --> 15:15.574
or hostages will continue
to fall from the sky.

15:19.679 --> 15:23.089
Tell Detective Paul
to have his men stand down.

15:24.019 --> 15:26.120
Bravo team, stand down.

15:29.762 --> 15:32.067
All clear.

15:32.100 --> 15:33.932
Done.

15:33.965 --> 15:35.101
What else?

15:35.134 --> 15:37.099
We'd like three v-tols
on the roof

15:37.140 --> 15:39.737
standing by, clear airspace
from here to the border,

15:39.770 --> 15:41.272
and finally, I'd like

15:41.305 --> 15:44.504
one fission igniter
delivered to me, please.

15:44.537 --> 15:47.410
That's military-grade
technology.

15:47.443 --> 15:49.114
I don't have that authority.

15:49.147 --> 15:51.712
Well, then I suggest
you contact someone who does.

15:55.081 --> 15:58.554
FEMALE COMPUTER VOICE:
Facial recognition identified.

16:06.105 --> 16:08.168
Now, you listen to me, Lucas,

16:08.209 --> 16:10.504
if you want me
to cooperate with you,

16:10.545 --> 16:12.608
I need you to cooperate with me.

16:12.641 --> 16:15.177
How many hostages do you have?

16:15.218 --> 16:19.053
More than enough
to end your career

16:19.086 --> 16:20.788
if they die.

16:20.821 --> 16:22.956
You have 43 minutes.

16:24.327 --> 16:27.431
Set the timer for 43 minutes,
and get me Rudy Lom.

16:29.999 --> 16:31.238
(pants)

16:31.271 --> 16:33.102
Hello?

16:33.135 --> 16:34.535
Are you there?

16:34.575 --> 16:36.071
Right here, Paige.

16:36.104 --> 16:37.912
Is anyone coming?

16:37.945 --> 16:38.976
You just hang tight.

16:39.009 --> 16:40.913
We're gonna be with
you real soon.

16:40.946 --> 16:42.788
Did you hear the phone call?

16:42.821 --> 16:44.621
Yeah, I did. Thank you.

16:44.654 --> 16:46.793
Just hold on a second.
I'll be right back.

16:46.826 --> 16:47.961
(beep)

16:47.994 --> 16:51.433
Is a fission igniter
as bad as I think it is?

16:51.466 --> 16:54.170
It's a trigger mechanism
for a large explosive device.

16:54.203 --> 16:55.770
Megaton level.

16:55.803 --> 16:57.937
Megaton.

16:58.977 --> 17:00.774
(comm beeps) Paige, you there?

17:00.807 --> 17:04.771
Can you tell me how many
hostages they've got up there?

17:04.804 --> 17:06.844
PAIGE (crying):
25 or so.

17:06.877 --> 17:08.813
At least in this room.

17:08.846 --> 17:10.814
It's hard for me to see.

17:10.847 --> 17:12.414
You're doing great, Paige.

17:12.454 --> 17:13.886
How's your sister?

17:13.919 --> 17:15.955
This is all my fault.

17:15.989 --> 17:19.018
She wouldn't be here
if it wasn't for me.

17:19.050 --> 17:21.256
She's visiting from out of town.

17:21.289 --> 17:22.790
She just stopped by

17:22.824 --> 17:24.920
to have lunch...

17:24.961 --> 17:27.458
and now she's all alone.

17:27.499 --> 17:30.299
Paige, can you tell me
how many gunmen there are?

17:30.332 --> 17:34.233
People keep coming and going;
I don't know.

17:34.266 --> 17:37.401
Five... six, at least.

17:37.441 --> 17:39.903
But there were more.

17:41.177 --> 17:43.642
I'm sorry, I can't do this.

17:43.683 --> 17:46.483
I'm so scared.

17:48.284 --> 17:50.389
Paige, you ever
been ice fishing?

17:50.422 --> 17:52.391
(Paige sighs)

17:52.424 --> 17:53.496
No.

17:53.529 --> 17:55.264
When I was 11 years old,

17:55.297 --> 17:59.064
my dad took me ice fishing
to Lake McFarland.

17:59.097 --> 18:02.272
We were coming back,
and all of a sudden

18:02.305 --> 18:06.108
the ice cracked,
and I went right under.

18:06.149 --> 18:08.847
I couldn't see,
I couldn't breathe.

18:08.888 --> 18:11.981
I thought I was gonna die.

18:12.022 --> 18:15.389
The water was so cold, it was
like thousands of needles

18:15.422 --> 18:17.894
stinging every part of my body.

18:17.927 --> 18:20.494
And then my dad jumped in,

18:20.527 --> 18:23.996
and he grabbed me and started
dragging me back to shore.

18:24.029 --> 18:26.996
Are you trying to
put her to sleep?

18:27.037 --> 18:30.099
And even though we were
still in a lot of danger,

18:30.132 --> 18:31.740
I felt safe.

18:31.773 --> 18:33.174
I felt like...

18:33.207 --> 18:35.542
everything was gonna be okay,

18:35.575 --> 18:37.677
because I wasn't alone.

18:37.710 --> 18:39.947
Paige...

18:39.980 --> 18:42.178
you're not alone.

18:42.211 --> 18:43.946
I'm with you.

18:43.979 --> 18:47.113
Everything is gonna be okay.

18:48.450 --> 18:51.186
Do you believe me?

18:52.092 --> 18:54.357
(softly):
Yeah, I do.

18:54.398 --> 18:56.430
All right, good girl.

18:56.463 --> 18:58.565
You just hang in there.

19:03.744 --> 19:05.111
(beeping)

19:05.144 --> 19:06.279
Yeah. Paul.

19:06.312 --> 19:08.309
MALDONADO:
Any sign of Kennex and Dorian?

19:08.342 --> 19:09.508
Uh, nothing so far.

19:09.541 --> 19:11.506
Keep your men back,
but I want drones

19:11.547 --> 19:13.347
and spotters
on every window and exit.

19:13.380 --> 19:15.245
I want to know
what's happening with my men.

19:15.286 --> 19:16.582
Yeah, you got it, Captain.

19:18.790 --> 19:21.420
There's no way
I can get a fission igniter.

19:25.096 --> 19:28.097
What if there was a way
to give them what they wanted

19:28.130 --> 19:30.337
and stall them at the same time?

19:30.370 --> 19:31.601
What have you got?

19:31.634 --> 19:33.272
I could build a replica.

19:33.305 --> 19:35.408
What if they can spot a fake?

19:35.441 --> 19:38.277
I can make one
that will pass a scan.

19:38.318 --> 19:41.013
If they test it out
or try and use it immediately,

19:41.054 --> 19:42.549
then we're out of luck.

19:42.582 --> 19:44.349
That's risk we'll have to take.

19:44.390 --> 19:45.485
Let's get started.

19:46.989 --> 19:48.356
- Captain?
- Yep?

19:48.389 --> 19:51.028
Lucas Vincent... he's
a high-level operative

19:51.061 --> 19:53.124
in the Holy Reclamation Army,

19:53.165 --> 19:54.805
a decentralized network
of terrorist cells

19:54.831 --> 19:57.735
with anti-Western bias
and a history of hostage taking,

19:57.768 --> 19:59.638
none of them ending well.

19:59.671 --> 20:01.972
Last August they took over
an embassy near Tokyo.

20:02.005 --> 20:04.435
Same MO...
they enter with force,

20:04.476 --> 20:06.603
drew the attention of the media
and law enforcement

20:06.644 --> 20:08.979
using human hostages as
collateral for their demands.

20:09.012 --> 20:10.843
- What happened?
- They facilitated

20:10.876 --> 20:12.810
the release of several
of their comrades.

20:12.843 --> 20:15.941
Once they got what they wanted,
they released the hostages.

20:15.974 --> 20:18.348
But they're not afraid
to take lives...

20:18.381 --> 20:19.845
including their own.

20:25.557 --> 20:27.237
DORIAN: You know, everyone
trips on stairs,

20:27.254 --> 20:31.464
and it's calculated to occur
in one in every 2,222 occasions.

20:31.497 --> 20:33.234
That's very interesting.

20:33.267 --> 20:35.536
- You know what would be interesting, John?
- What?

20:35.569 --> 20:37.934
If you told me that
ice fishing story again.

20:52.372 --> 20:55.908
If you want to get in shape, we can
run the O-course every weekend.

20:55.941 --> 20:57.645
O-can we?

21:07.361 --> 21:09.625
Let's split up.

21:28.680 --> 21:31.245
?

22:07.160 --> 22:09.062
(ringing)

22:31.642 --> 22:34.408
Dorian, you okay?

22:34.441 --> 22:36.840
DORIAN (over comm):
John, get over here.

22:49.322 --> 22:51.757
Floor's clear.

22:51.790 --> 22:53.986
You okay?

22:54.019 --> 22:55.986
You took one to the head.

22:56.019 --> 22:59.123
Yeah, ricochet.

22:59.164 --> 23:01.489
Whatcha got?

23:01.530 --> 23:02.657
I'm not sure.

23:02.697 --> 23:04.095
But there's writing on it.

23:04.128 --> 23:05.064
"Start."

23:05.097 --> 23:07.768
- Start?
- Start.

23:09.168 --> 23:11.101
You I.D.'d him?

23:15.270 --> 23:17.637
His name is Michael Demerais.

23:17.670 --> 23:19.803
He's a member of
the Holy Reclamation Army.

23:19.836 --> 23:21.674
So they're behind this.

23:23.809 --> 23:26.072
Maybe not.

23:32.483 --> 23:35.152
It's a facemaker.

23:40.522 --> 23:41.891
So who's this guy?

23:43.163 --> 23:45.098
His name is Gregor Stone.

23:45.131 --> 23:46.933
He has a few priors
for armed robbery.

23:46.966 --> 23:48.302
Why would they
impersonate members

23:48.335 --> 23:50.378
of a radical organization?

23:50.411 --> 23:53.312
(electrical crackling)
What's wrong?

23:53.345 --> 23:56.878
My dynamic voltage scaling
has been damaged by the bullet.

23:56.911 --> 23:59.413
You want to say that
a little less complicated?

23:59.447 --> 24:02.252
I won't be able to walk
in five minutes.

24:10.918 --> 24:12.315
Where are our v-tols?

24:12.348 --> 24:13.819
I'm working on it.

24:19.721 --> 24:22.054
Based on the frequency
at which these transmit...

24:22.087 --> 24:24.826
I detect seven facemakers
in the building.

24:24.859 --> 24:27.257
If they hide their identities,

24:27.298 --> 24:29.128
why not just wear a mask?

24:29.161 --> 24:31.431
Why pretend to be
something else?

24:31.464 --> 24:33.865
That's a good question.

24:41.873 --> 24:43.944
All right. (Sighs)

24:43.977 --> 24:45.807
Let's try and fix you.

24:49.350 --> 24:51.244
How does it look?

24:51.277 --> 24:53.683
Yeah, it's, uh, totally fine.

24:53.716 --> 24:55.179
You can hardly see it.

24:55.220 --> 24:56.554
Okay.

24:56.587 --> 24:58.554
So, what do I do?

24:58.588 --> 25:00.386
All right, there's a
magenta colored tendon.

25:00.419 --> 25:02.091
I need you to cut it.

25:03.755 --> 25:05.654
All right, is...
is that thing clean?

25:05.688 --> 25:07.158
Of course it is.

25:07.191 --> 25:08.958
Are you sure?

25:08.991 --> 25:10.496
Positive.

25:11.530 --> 25:13.699
(crackling) (groans) Damn it.

25:13.740 --> 25:16.235
- I said magenta.
- It was magenta.

25:16.276 --> 25:17.770
- I said magenta. That was lavender.
- The hell's magenta?

25:17.803 --> 25:19.738
There's 50 shades
of purple in there.

25:19.771 --> 25:21.378
I'm telling you,
that was the lavender one.

25:21.411 --> 25:23.378
- No, no. Okay, wait a minute.
- What?

25:23.411 --> 25:24.642
- What are you doing with that?
- Gotta cut the wire.

25:24.683 --> 25:26.515
That's not going
inside of my head.

25:26.548 --> 25:28.020
- I'm your partner, trust me.
- If Rudy were here,

25:28.053 --> 25:30.592
he'd have a really big issue
with you right now.

25:30.625 --> 25:31.889
- John...
- Look, it could always be worse.

25:31.930 --> 25:33.822
John, the statistics...
You're going to be fine.

25:33.863 --> 25:36.929
(whirring, powering down)

25:36.962 --> 25:38.940
Dorian?

25:51.721 --> 25:55.192
Please stop looking at me
like that.

25:55.225 --> 25:56.793
You have five minutes to deliver

25:56.826 --> 25:58.596
the decoy fission device.

25:58.629 --> 26:01.934
I'm working as fast as I can.

26:03.174 --> 26:05.310
Four minutes, 45 seconds.

26:05.343 --> 26:09.049
You can't put a clock
on perfection.

26:09.082 --> 26:10.745
Clearly someone was rushing

26:10.786 --> 26:13.280
when they designed
your manners chip.

26:15.587 --> 26:17.725
(breathing anxiously)

26:20.598 --> 26:21.861
PAIGE (over comm):
John, are you there?

26:21.894 --> 26:24.367
I can hear you, Paige.

26:24.400 --> 26:25.936
They've moved.

26:25.969 --> 26:28.072
They keep going
to a corner window...

26:28.105 --> 26:29.912
doing something.

26:29.945 --> 26:31.376
What are they doing?

26:31.409 --> 26:33.911
PAIGE:
I don't know.

26:33.944 --> 26:35.782
(woman crying)

26:35.815 --> 26:39.521
My sister... she's crying.

26:39.554 --> 26:42.188
And one of the guards,
he keeps looking at her.

26:42.229 --> 26:46.398
Look, I promise I'll get
to you soon, Paige.

26:46.431 --> 26:48.630
What's your sister's name?

26:48.671 --> 26:50.103
Jenna.

26:50.136 --> 26:51.440
Jenna?

26:51.473 --> 26:53.409
Her middle name's Gertrude.

26:53.443 --> 26:55.274
Ooh, that's rough.

26:55.315 --> 26:57.313
What's yours?

26:57.346 --> 27:00.080
Oh, no. No, no,
we're not doing that.

27:00.113 --> 27:02.680
Come on, tell me.

27:06.019 --> 27:09.765
All right, but you better not
tell anyone, okay?

27:09.798 --> 27:11.892
Police orders.

27:13.301 --> 27:15.132
It's Reginald.

27:15.165 --> 27:17.573
My dad was a big Elton John fan.

27:17.606 --> 27:19.174
Who?

27:19.207 --> 27:20.439
Elton John.

27:20.472 --> 27:21.839
He's an old-time singer.

27:21.880 --> 27:24.176
Apparently, his real name
was Reginald.

27:24.217 --> 27:26.753
(gasps)

27:26.786 --> 27:27.882
You okay?

27:27.923 --> 27:30.921
PAIGE:
Huh?

27:30.954 --> 27:32.088
Gross.

27:32.121 --> 27:33.424
But good.

27:33.457 --> 27:35.794
Something's happening.

27:36.395 --> 27:37.459
LUCAS:
Get over here and help.

27:37.500 --> 27:40.099
(groans) One of the gunmen,

27:40.132 --> 27:42.036
he's hurt.

27:42.069 --> 27:43.469
Who shot you?

27:43.502 --> 27:44.976
There are two men
in the building.

27:45.009 --> 27:46.514
Cops?

27:46.548 --> 27:47.885
I don't know.

27:47.918 --> 27:50.023
Where's Gregor?

27:50.056 --> 27:51.559
We got separated.

27:51.592 --> 27:52.928
BOONE:
Do you want us to look for him?

27:52.961 --> 27:54.562
No.

27:54.595 --> 27:56.027
Put more men on the stairwell.

27:56.068 --> 27:57.637
No one gets up on this floor.

27:57.670 --> 28:00.238
Go. You, go.

28:00.271 --> 28:02.912
John, they know
you're in the building.

28:02.945 --> 28:06.775
They sent a couple guys with
giant guns to guard the stairs.

28:08.646 --> 28:10.148
Even if you do get up here,

28:10.181 --> 28:11.644
how are you gonna get in?

28:11.685 --> 28:13.381
Trust me, Paige.

28:13.414 --> 28:15.285
We'll find a way to get to you.

28:19.562 --> 28:21.522
LUCAS: I'm disappointed in
you, Captain Maldonado.

28:21.530 --> 28:23.526
I thought we were getting along
so well.

28:23.560 --> 28:25.696
I don't know what
you're talking about.

28:25.737 --> 28:27.634
I said no cops.

28:28.907 --> 28:31.075
I pulled my men back.

28:31.108 --> 28:32.839
The only people I have there
are conducting the evacuation,

28:32.872 --> 28:35.110
outside the building.

28:35.143 --> 28:37.910
Then how do you explain
the two cops

28:37.943 --> 28:40.144
my men just killed downstairs?

28:41.346 --> 28:43.957
(quietly):
He's bluffing.

28:45.055 --> 28:47.063
I don't know what men
you killed,

28:47.096 --> 28:49.063
but they weren't mine.

28:49.096 --> 28:51.598
We made a deal.

28:51.631 --> 28:53.967
I get you what you want,
no one else dies.

28:59.975 --> 29:03.973
When do I get
my fission ignitor?

29:06.249 --> 29:08.250
It's on its way,
ten minutes or less.

29:08.283 --> 29:10.552
Great. Every minute longer

29:10.585 --> 29:13.221
is another body you'll be
scraping off the pavement.

29:19.588 --> 29:21.793
(murmuring, crying)

29:22.794 --> 29:25.192
(crying)

29:27.097 --> 29:29.200
Keep your mouth shut.

29:34.200 --> 29:35.838
PAIGE:
John?

29:36.733 --> 29:38.530
I'm going out there.

29:38.569 --> 29:40.430
I can't leave Jenna alone.

29:42.164 --> 29:43.866
Paige, that's a bad idea.

29:43.899 --> 29:45.801
I have to. I have to.

29:45.834 --> 29:47.168
We're a few floors away.

29:47.201 --> 29:48.632
She needs me.

29:48.665 --> 29:51.272
I need her.

29:51.305 --> 29:53.135
If we're gonna die...

29:53.168 --> 29:55.271
(cries)

29:55.304 --> 29:58.110
...I want to be with her.

29:58.143 --> 30:02.280
She's my sister.

30:03.386 --> 30:05.718
Now is my only chance
to blend in

30:05.751 --> 30:07.149
without anyone seeing me.

30:07.183 --> 30:08.950
Paige, just stay where you are.

30:08.983 --> 30:10.254
I'll leave my phone open.

30:10.287 --> 30:11.958
You'll be able to hear
what's going on.

30:11.991 --> 30:13.125
Paige, it's too risky.

30:13.158 --> 30:14.924
Listen to me, just stay put.

30:14.957 --> 30:16.322
I have to.

30:16.355 --> 30:18.121
Paige, please,

30:18.154 --> 30:20.059
just listen to me. Paige.

30:20.092 --> 30:23.101
Paige, are you there? Paige?

30:33.845 --> 30:35.539
(speaking indistinctly)

30:42.712 --> 30:44.447
I think I can do that.

30:45.680 --> 30:48.350
I'm here.

30:48.383 --> 30:50.884
It'll be okay.

30:55.973 --> 30:57.236
MALDONADO (over comm):
Detective Paul?

30:57.269 --> 30:59.136
Copy. The ignitor
is ready for delivery.

30:59.169 --> 31:00.368
Come on.

31:00.408 --> 31:02.440
Come on, come on, speed it up.

31:02.473 --> 31:04.311
(coupling clicks, hisses)

31:04.326 --> 31:05.693
It's good to go, sir.

31:05.734 --> 31:07.534
Okay, waiting on your order.

31:08.439 --> 31:10.335
Send it.

31:10.368 --> 31:12.206
Let's get her up.

31:37.457 --> 31:40.194
Excuse me.

31:40.227 --> 31:42.067
I have to go to the bathroom.

31:45.835 --> 31:48.904
You're not going to make me
pee on the floor, are you?

31:49.840 --> 31:51.904
You've got 30 seconds.

31:51.937 --> 31:54.874
MAN:
Hey, boss...

31:54.915 --> 31:56.747
we're getting another delivery.

32:09.764 --> 32:11.829
The drone's coming.

32:13.831 --> 32:15.806
(lock whirs, clicks)

32:15.839 --> 32:17.302
(shuddering exhale)

32:31.981 --> 32:33.621
MALDONADO:
We had an agreement, Lucas.

32:33.654 --> 32:35.590
We've operated
in good faith here.

32:35.623 --> 32:37.662
LUCAS:
I believe in honoring a deal.

32:37.695 --> 32:39.830
Stand by.

32:39.863 --> 32:43.462
I'll let you know how we're
gonna release the hostages.

32:46.368 --> 32:48.070
Let's hope they buy it.

32:48.103 --> 32:50.573
Send the message
to the other crew now.

32:51.638 --> 32:53.173
They should be ready.

32:53.206 --> 32:54.972
It's time to wind this up.

32:55.805 --> 32:57.540
What other crew?

32:57.580 --> 32:59.443
Maybe there are more of them
in the building.

32:59.477 --> 33:01.779
- Maybe they're outside the building.
- But the jammer's

33:01.812 --> 33:03.211
still on.
If they have people outside,

33:03.252 --> 33:05.051
they wouldn't be able
to talk to each other.

33:05.084 --> 33:08.451
Unless they were talking
some other way.

33:16.829 --> 33:18.961
"Start."

33:23.466 --> 33:25.707
(whirring)

33:28.815 --> 33:30.110
They must be using it

33:30.143 --> 33:31.877
as some sort
of point-to-point communication

33:31.910 --> 33:33.044
with someone in proximity

33:33.077 --> 33:35.884
- of the building.
- Paige said the man in charge...

33:35.917 --> 33:37.716
kept going to the window.

33:49.429 --> 33:50.901
I didn't think
they'd come through.

33:50.934 --> 33:53.769
What if there's
a tracking device?

33:53.810 --> 33:55.505
We're not taking it anyway.

33:55.538 --> 33:58.144
It doesn't matter.

33:58.177 --> 34:01.407
(panting)

34:01.448 --> 34:04.145
He doesn't want the tech.
That doesn't make sense.

34:05.653 --> 34:08.157
Why take hostages and negotiate
for tech you don't want?

34:08.190 --> 34:09.893
Maybe it's a diversion.

34:09.927 --> 34:12.766
Yeah, but for what?

34:14.664 --> 34:16.505
Are there any targets

34:16.538 --> 34:18.603
of value
in the adjacent buildings?

34:22.510 --> 34:23.949
The only target of any value is

34:23.982 --> 34:27.119
a precious metal weigh station
specializing in palladium.

34:28.889 --> 34:30.159
It's a heist.

34:30.192 --> 34:33.127
Palladium. That would make
all this worthwhile.

34:33.159 --> 34:35.358
(quiet clicking)

34:51.480 --> 34:52.614
Wrap it up.

34:52.648 --> 34:54.112
We're out of here in ten.

35:01.294 --> 35:03.262
(woman crying in distance)

35:03.295 --> 35:05.431
(clank, click)

35:07.968 --> 35:10.504
Hang in there, Daniel.

35:10.537 --> 35:11.976
When this is over,

35:12.009 --> 35:14.008
we'll all be on
a beach somewhere,

35:14.041 --> 35:15.746
you'll be as good as new.

35:15.779 --> 35:18.281
I need a doctor.

35:18.314 --> 35:20.449
Soon.

35:26.125 --> 35:28.263
(beeping, whirring)

35:31.672 --> 35:33.167
JOHN:
What's that beeping?

35:34.303 --> 35:36.899
You and the guys pick
three hostages.

35:36.939 --> 35:38.665
Why?

35:38.706 --> 35:41.371
We may need insurance.

35:41.412 --> 35:42.780
Let's pack it up.

35:42.813 --> 35:45.447
John, they've activated
a light bomb.

35:45.480 --> 35:48.013
They're gonna kill
the hostages.

35:52.617 --> 35:53.686
What are you doing?

35:53.704 --> 35:55.279
Sticking to the plan.
We're going up.

35:55.320 --> 35:56.401
John, they know we're here.

35:56.416 --> 35:57.919
They're expecting us
to come up the stairs.

35:57.952 --> 35:59.456
We won't make it
to the 25th floor alive.

35:59.489 --> 36:01.024
You heard him.

36:01.057 --> 36:02.561
We have no choice.

36:02.594 --> 36:04.762
I don't have a choice.

36:06.163 --> 36:08.063
People's lives are in jeopardy.

36:08.096 --> 36:10.368
You've been shot.
Your head's

36:10.401 --> 36:13.073
full of bubble gum.
You can't do this alone.

36:13.106 --> 36:14.272
I have to.

36:14.305 --> 36:16.072
Then I'm coming with you.

36:16.105 --> 36:17.274
You can't.

36:18.347 --> 36:21.315
I'm designed to do this, John.

36:23.213 --> 36:25.347
(cables rattling)

36:54.750 --> 36:56.423
LUCAS:
It's time.

36:56.456 --> 36:59.087
Jenna...

36:59.120 --> 37:00.759
why don't you come with me.

37:00.792 --> 37:02.928
No, no, no.
Don't you touch her.

37:02.961 --> 37:04.466
Don't you touch her. Take me!

37:04.499 --> 37:06.235
Let her go! I will shoot you!

37:06.268 --> 37:08.172
I will shoot you! PAIGE: No, no!
Take me! No, leave her!

37:08.205 --> 37:10.269
Take me! Please! Me!

37:10.310 --> 37:11.677
(hostages screaming)

37:15.549 --> 37:16.812
Police! Get down!

37:21.750 --> 37:22.949
(grunts)

37:25.190 --> 37:26.893
(yelling)

37:29.693 --> 37:32.859
(electrical crackling)

37:37.498 --> 37:38.897
(whirring)

37:38.929 --> 37:40.369
What's your name?

37:41.866 --> 37:45.444
I've never killed a man
I didn't know.

37:46.679 --> 37:48.645
But then again...

37:48.678 --> 37:50.809
you're not a man.

37:50.842 --> 37:53.310
Are you?

37:55.111 --> 37:57.680
Nice of you to show up, Gregor.

37:57.721 --> 37:59.088
Where the hell have you been?

37:59.121 --> 38:02.087
We thought you were dead.

38:02.919 --> 38:04.719
(grunting)

38:05.960 --> 38:07.391
(grunts)

38:12.263 --> 38:14.230
(beeps) Maldonado?

38:14.263 --> 38:15.366
John?

38:15.399 --> 38:16.502
The hostages are secure.

38:16.535 --> 38:18.101
The whole thing
is a palladium heist.

38:18.134 --> 38:19.205
Shut it off... now!

38:19.238 --> 38:21.269
They got us to block
the alarm system.

38:21.302 --> 38:23.437
Turn the jammer off!

38:24.606 --> 38:26.109
Detective Paul,
turn off the jammer now!

38:26.142 --> 38:27.910
Shut it off.

38:27.943 --> 38:30.381
(whooshing, powering down)

38:30.414 --> 38:32.845
(computer trilling, whooshing)

38:32.885 --> 38:34.821
(phones ringing)

38:36.086 --> 38:39.055
(alarm blaring)

38:39.088 --> 38:40.023
Let's go.

38:40.056 --> 38:42.190
(door whooshes shut)

38:47.661 --> 38:49.331
(indistinct shouting)

38:50.868 --> 38:52.363
(sighs)

38:52.404 --> 38:55.137
(panting)

38:55.170 --> 38:58.441
(garbled radio transmission,
indistinct shouting)

38:58.474 --> 39:00.777
Thank you.

39:07.947 --> 39:09.987
PAIGE:
John?

39:10.020 --> 39:11.724
You must be Paige.

39:11.757 --> 39:13.222
(Paige laughs quietly)

39:19.732 --> 39:21.226
Thank you.

39:21.259 --> 39:22.899
No. Thank you.

39:22.932 --> 39:24.438
You were very brave.

39:24.471 --> 39:26.639
You helped save a
lot of lives today.

39:27.504 --> 39:29.679
Where's your partner?

39:29.712 --> 39:32.344
Oh, he's, uh...

39:32.378 --> 39:36.084
he's getting patched up.

39:37.527 --> 39:39.494
John, this is my sister.

39:39.527 --> 39:41.262
This is Jenna.

39:41.295 --> 39:43.366
Jenna, it's a
pleasure to meet you.

39:43.399 --> 39:44.966
I've heard a lot about you.

39:59.390 --> 40:01.789
(applause)

40:06.194 --> 40:08.962
(applause fades)

40:11.261 --> 40:13.332
I'm glad you're okay.

40:13.365 --> 40:15.132
Thanks.

40:15.166 --> 40:17.740
I've got some
intel on the perps.

40:17.774 --> 40:20.140
Guy behind it all
was Gerald Leighton.

40:20.174 --> 40:21.706
We linked him and his men

40:21.739 --> 40:24.272
to four high-value robberies
in the last two years.

40:24.305 --> 40:27.145
JOHN: Using police jamming protocol
to initiate a palladium heist.

40:27.178 --> 40:28.650
Pretty elaborate
for a bunch of thieves.

40:28.683 --> 40:30.850
It's going
to be a paperwork nightmare.

40:30.883 --> 40:32.851
And I thought you had come
down here to thank me.

40:32.884 --> 40:34.587
For what? Doing your job?

40:34.621 --> 40:36.524
Just for the record,

40:36.557 --> 40:39.029
I did tell you to get out
of the building, right?

40:39.062 --> 40:42.929
I swear, all I heard was static.

40:42.962 --> 40:46.700
Oi! I've got a bone to pick
with you, Detective.

40:46.733 --> 40:48.172
Chewing gum? Really?

40:48.205 --> 40:50.172
Would you fix a race car
with chewing gum?

40:50.205 --> 40:52.738
Uh, yeah, if it was busted,
and I need to win a race.

40:52.771 --> 40:55.072
He'll need extensive
diagnostics.

40:55.105 --> 40:57.308
Ah, that can wait.

40:57.349 --> 41:00.548
Come on, let's go
get some noodles.

41:01.981 --> 41:03.316
You are aware that I don't eat.

41:03.349 --> 41:05.587
Perfect. I'm buying. Let's roll.

41:11.227 --> 41:14.126
Well, I'll just wait here,
shall I?

41:14.167 --> 41:17.002
(engine revving)

41:20.210 --> 41:24.414
Thank you for what
you did back there.

41:26.049 --> 41:28.153
Don't mention it.

41:28.186 --> 41:33.761
Besides, no one messes
with my coffee warmer.

41:38.869 --> 41:41.542
Hey, John, you know
that story you told Paige,

41:41.575 --> 41:44.139
when you fell through the ice
as a kid?

41:46.474 --> 41:48.674
When that gun
was pointed at my head,

41:48.715 --> 41:50.811
I felt something similar.

41:53.948 --> 41:56.389
I-I didn't want to die.

41:58.793 --> 42:01.764
I know it's not the same
with me, but...

42:01.805 --> 42:03.932
Hey, dead is dead.

42:07.238 --> 42:09.208
Yeah.

42:09.249 --> 42:11.913
I suppose so.

42:16.325 --> 42:19.663
Why don't you chuck
some music on?

42:22.336 --> 42:25.672
? She's got electric boots,
a mohair suit ?

42:25.705 --> 42:27.809
? You know I read it
in a magazine... ?

42:27.842 --> 42:31.145
Elton John, huh?
You heard me, didn't you?

42:32.547 --> 42:35.482
(sings along): ? Buh-buh-buh
Bennie and the Jets ?

42:37.788 --> 42:39.789
ELTON JOHN:
? Bennie... ?

42:39.822 --> 42:42.430
(joining in):
? Bennie and the Jets ?

42:42.463 --> 42:44.398
Don't. Don't.
Please, don't do that.

42:44.431 --> 42:46.535
Whatever you say, Reginald.

42:48.771 --> 42:51.005
ELTON JOHN:
? Bennie ?

42:51.046 --> 42:52.776
(singing along):
? Bennie ?

42:52.817 --> 42:57.647
? Bennie,
Bennie and the Jets... ?
