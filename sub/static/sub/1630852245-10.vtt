12:21.250 --> 12:23.625
[Nowhere King] She's… She's here.

-I'll die if we go now. [yelps]
-We'll die if we stay!

13:08.208 --> 13:10.750
[Nowhere King] You made me what I am.

13:10.833 --> 13:12.750

I'm gonna do the thing!

15:12.000 --> 15:17.458
Okay, so just take a few deep breaths
before you get up. It's… It's weird here.

15:18.875 --> 15:21.958
But, uh, welcome to Centaurworld.

Hello! Oh!

15:46.458 --> 15:48.958
Mmm! Mmm! Mmm!

15:49.041 --> 15:52.541
What about all the extra lumbar support
from the Grasstaurs?

15:52.625 --> 15:54.791
Shiatsu or Swedish?

15:54.875 --> 15:56.875
I'll take a combination.

-[Glendale] Huh?

16:40.875 --> 16:43.291
You know what? It's cool. He can keep it.

16:43.375 --> 16:45.041
I think I need to sit down.

-Ooh, okay.

16:51.250 --> 16:52.458
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

16:52.541 --> 16:56.833
It's all right. I… I know that
Centaurworld is a lot, but you're okay.

16:59.416 --> 17:01.916
[sighs] You're right. We're okay.

17:02.000 --> 17:03.375
And now we can go back.

17:03.458 --> 17:04.375
But first…

17:05.083 --> 17:06.791
-Party time!
-[dance music playing]

17:06.875 --> 17:09.541
-All right!
-Who wants punch? I still got punch.

17:09.625 --> 17:13.208
Freezing toilet raisin punch!
It's delicious. Mmm!

17:13.291 --> 17:17.791
-Okay, so, what does all this mean?
-Both of the worlds are connected again.

17:17.875 --> 17:20.833
This is how it always was
and how it's meant to be.

17:20.916 --> 17:23.333
[woman] None of you should be celebrating.

17:25.791 --> 17:27.041
Oh yeah. You.

17:28.708 --> 17:31.041
You did not kill the Nowhere King.

17:31.125 --> 17:34.500
Wha-- He 'sploded. Boom!

17:34.583 --> 17:37.250
You don't understand the magic he wields.

17:39.416 --> 17:41.416
[rocks rumbling]

17:43.291 --> 17:47.291
He's going to come back stronger,
with even more hatred in his heart.

17:48.583 --> 17:50.833
[thunder crashing]

17:51.958 --> 17:56.250
Now that the Rift is permanently opened
and the key is gone…

17:57.250 --> 17:58.708
[ominous music playing]

18:01.083 --> 18:04.500
…he won't stop
until he's destroyed both worlds.

18:05.333 --> 18:06.416
Uh, wha-- [scoffs]

18:06.500 --> 18:10.041
Why do you always have to say the thing
that makes everything bad?

18:10.125 --> 18:13.041
Say your goodbyes. It won't be long now.

18:16.083 --> 18:17.583
Ugh! I hate her.

18:18.333 --> 18:21.500
But again, that exit-- Nope, nope, nope.
There she is.

18:22.333 --> 18:24.166
She doesn't get that far, does she?

18:24.250 --> 18:26.833
We were barely holding our own
in one world.

18:26.916 --> 18:28.875
How can we fight a war in two?

18:28.958 --> 18:32.333
Let's… Let's go to the General.
He'll know how to proceed.

18:34.083 --> 18:37.000
I guess this is goodbye.

18:40.208 --> 18:41.208

18:42.083 --> 18:44.166
-[Centaurs] Goodbye!
-We'll see ya.

18:45.833 --> 18:50.083
No matter where you are,
you will always be a part of our herd.

18:52.000 --> 18:53.000
I know.

18:56.666 --> 18:58.791
Now what are we gonna do, Wammawink?

18:58.875 --> 19:00.333
Oh, don't worry.

19:00.416 --> 19:03.958
We'll go back
and I'll make a new dome to protect us.

19:04.041 --> 19:06.666
[Durpleton] Can it hold
all the new friends we made?

19:07.375 --> 19:10.166
Uh… Well, uh… [clears throat]

19:10.666 --> 19:14.375
-Horse?
-[snorts] We need two armies.

19:15.625 --> 19:16.458
The flock?

19:16.541 --> 19:21.291
There aren't enough humans to fight.
Centaurworld needs an army of its own.

19:22.500 --> 19:23.958
I have to stay here.

19:24.041 --> 19:26.833
I can't even.

19:27.875 --> 19:29.666
What? Why?

19:29.750 --> 19:32.833
They don't know anything about war,
but I do.

19:32.916 --> 19:35.750
-I have to train the Centaurs to fight.
-But--

19:35.833 --> 19:39.958
All this time, I've been so scared
I wouldn't recognize myself anymore.

19:40.041 --> 19:43.125
That you wouldn't recognize me.
But I know who I am.

19:43.625 --> 19:46.875
I'm the horse who is going
to build an army of Centaurs,

19:46.958 --> 19:49.875
so we can fight the Nowhere King
from both sides.

19:49.958 --> 19:52.875
You need to ask the General
to bring his forces here.

19:52.958 --> 19:55.875
With both the armies,
we can finally end this war.
