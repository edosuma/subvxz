00:03.740 --> 00:06.420
<i>Previously on Stargate Atlantis...</i>

00:07.780 --> 00:11.220
Dr. Weir, we're ready to go.
We'll meet you at the rendezvous site.

00:12.940 --> 00:17.220
Your identification code was used
to access this city's operating system.

00:17.260 --> 00:19.820
You think that I'm working for the trust?

00:21.220 --> 00:22.500
Oh, my God.

00:24.000 --> 00:30.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:37.100 --> 00:39.860
And people just sit and watch
this box for hours at a time?

00:39.900 --> 00:42.540
- Yeah, people do.
- Is it that engaging?

00:42.580 --> 00:43.740
It depends what's on it.

00:43.780 --> 00:47.540
There are lots
of programs on dozens of channels every day, all day.

00:47.580 --> 00:52.780
Most of which are fictional representations
of ridiculously attractive people in absurd situations.

00:52.820 --> 00:56.260
<i>There are educational programs,
all sorts of documentaries...</i>

00:56.300 --> 00:59.140
not many people watch 'em, but, well, they're on.

00:59.180 --> 01:02.380
And that's what everybody
on your planet does for entertainment.

01:02.460 --> 01:04.099
Watch a box.

01:04.500 --> 01:08.660
Not everyone, although I will confess
to the occasional half-hour of Jeopardy.

01:08.700 --> 01:11.500
- Jeopardy?
- It's the name of the show. Jeopardy.

01:11.540 --> 01:13.140
Sounds dangerous.

01:13.180 --> 01:16.100
Double Jeopardy... that's twice as dangerous.

01:18.740 --> 01:20.340
It's a proximity alarm.

01:20.380 --> 01:21.780
Something's out there.

01:21.820 --> 01:22.860
A ship?

01:23.100 --> 01:24.300
<i>No...</i>

01:24.700 --> 01:26.860
there's two of 'em.
There's another one in a lower orbit.

01:26.900 --> 01:29.780
- Another what?
- I don't know, but...

01:30.220 --> 01:32.260
it's big enough to hold a person.

01:32.300 --> 01:34.060
Maybe it's a coffin.

01:34.580 --> 01:37.100
Perhaps jettisoned from a ship?

01:37.580 --> 01:38.980
Space burial?

01:39.100 --> 01:40.220
<i>No.</i>

01:41.380 --> 01:42.860
It's definitely not a coffin.

01:42.900 --> 01:45.780
<i>I'm reading life
signs coming from inside of both of them.</i>

01:46.340 --> 01:47.500
<i>Whoever's in there...</i>

01:47.980 --> 01:49.500
they're still alive.

02:03.820 --> 02:05.980
<i>Dr. Weir, the first pod is ready.</i>

02:06.020 --> 02:07.860
I'm on my way down.

02:10.100 --> 02:11.580
Colonel Caldwell.

02:12.060 --> 02:13.820
I see you have arrived without your ship.

02:13.900 --> 02:18.540
Yes, well, Hermiod's doing some repairs
to the hyperdrive that requires traveling
in a wide orbit around the solar system,

02:18.580 --> 02:20.260
so while my ship flies in circles,

02:20.300 --> 02:23.700
I thought I'd beam down early and
see if I could do a little repair work of my own.

02:23.740 --> 02:26.380
- That's not necessary.
- I think it is.

02:26.780 --> 02:31.900
The host to a Goa'uld parasite is aware
of what's happening to them.
I won't soon forget what I was forced to do.

02:31.940 --> 02:35.340
Still, you can't be held responsible for your actions...

02:35.820 --> 02:37.620
- whereas I can.
- No.

02:37.660 --> 02:40.140
<i>You did what you had to do.
Lives were at stake.</i>

02:40.300 --> 02:43.260
I would have done the same thing
had the situation been reversed.

02:45.780 --> 02:49.220
Colonel Sheppard's team just discovered
something very interesting in the Kohal system.

02:49.420 --> 02:52.020
I was on my way down to see.
Do you care to join us?

02:52.060 --> 02:54.460
I would love to. Thank you.

03:04.180 --> 03:05.060
Dr. Weir.

03:05.100 --> 03:08.300
- Oh, Colonel Caldwell. Welcome back.
- Thank you, Doctor.

03:08.460 --> 03:10.740
- Colonel, what do we got?
- We think it's

03:10.780 --> 03:12.660
a life pod of some kind.

03:12.700 --> 03:17.100
It appears to be designed solely for the purposes
of maintaining a single human life in stasis.

03:17.500 --> 03:18.900
<i>This one's a female.</i>

03:19.580 --> 03:23.740
There was another one in a decaying orbit, but
we could only fit one inside the Jumper.

03:23.780 --> 03:26.500
<i>I've already sent Lorne in Jumper 6
to recover the second pod.</i>

03:26.540 --> 03:28.940
Ronon and Teyla went along
to help him locate it.

03:28.980 --> 03:31.780
Okay, I'm ready to crack her open.

03:32.620 --> 03:33.860
Hey.

03:34.340 --> 03:35.860
Hello, Doctor.

03:50.220 --> 03:51.500
She's alive.

03:51.540 --> 03:52.500
Barely.

03:53.860 --> 03:56.300
<i>It appears we found her very near the end.</i>

03:56.380 --> 03:58.900
<i>All the major organs are shutting down.</i>

04:00.100 --> 04:01.700
How long was she out there?

04:01.740 --> 04:03.300
There's no way to tell for certain.

04:04.740 --> 04:08.700
- So she could be an Ancient.
- The pod design makes me doubt that.

04:09.420 --> 04:11.900
It's a shame she can't speak with us.

04:12.220 --> 04:15.100
Just imagine what she could tell us about her people

04:15.140 --> 04:17.300
and about what happened to her.

04:19.180 --> 04:20.300
<i>Elizabeth!</i>

04:20.339 --> 04:22.300
Medical team to lab three, stat!

05:29.900 --> 05:33.580
- This is not my fault.
- We were all there. Relax.

05:34.220 --> 05:35.740
She's coming around.

05:48.860 --> 05:50.100
You okay?

05:51.020 --> 05:52.620
Dr. Weir is fine.

05:53.340 --> 05:56.860
Dr. Weir doesn't talk about
herself in the third person.

05:58.220 --> 06:01.500
She was simply overcome by
the effects of the imprinting.

06:01.540 --> 06:03.220
Security team to the infirmary.

06:03.260 --> 06:05.100
<i>That's not necessary, Colonel...</i>

06:05.220 --> 06:06.460
Caldwell.

06:08.140 --> 06:11.300
She is merely harboring my consciousness.

06:11.340 --> 06:13.860
- Here we go again.
- And you are?

06:13.940 --> 06:15.420
I am Phoebus.

06:15.460 --> 06:17.660
We are a race of explorers.

06:17.660 --> 06:19.860
On our journey home, our vessel was attacked.

06:19.900 --> 06:21.060
By the Wraith?

06:21.100 --> 06:22.260
Yes.

06:22.700 --> 06:26.420
<i>We were forced to abandon ship
and launch our life pods.</i>

06:26.700 --> 06:28.900
<i>If this has happened to me...</i>

06:28.940 --> 06:34.100
then I have been adrift for some time and the pod
has determined my body is beyond resuscitation.

06:34.620 --> 06:36.180
You're quite correct.

06:36.220 --> 06:39.140
Then for all intents and purposes,
I am already dead.

06:39.780 --> 06:41.140
I'm sorry.

06:42.620 --> 06:43.740
So am I.

06:43.780 --> 06:46.740
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
We're all very sorry. Where's Elizabeth?

06:46.780 --> 06:48.060
She is here also.

06:48.100 --> 06:50.860
And I suppose you'd like us
to take your word for that?

06:50.900 --> 06:52.660
Would you like to speak with her?

06:52.700 --> 06:54.580
Yes, we would.

06:59.540 --> 07:00.740
Dr Weir?

07:01.540 --> 07:03.460
It's okay, Carson. I'm...

07:04.100 --> 07:05.780
I'm fine.

07:06.660 --> 07:08.180
Elizabeth...

07:08.860 --> 07:10.940
I'm not sure if you're aware of this,
but there's another...

07:10.980 --> 07:13.180
I know. Her name is Phoebus.

07:13.220 --> 07:15.660
You seem remarkably sanguine about all this.

07:15.700 --> 07:19.580
Well, the imprinting will only last a matter of hours.

07:19.620 --> 07:20.940
<i>The other pod...</i>

07:21.020 --> 07:24.620
Phoebus urgently desires to be here
when we bring the other pod back to Atlantis.

07:24.660 --> 07:25.980
Why?

07:26.700 --> 07:29.020
- She believes it's her husband.
- Husband?

07:29.220 --> 07:32.100
<i>He escaped the ship, she's certain of it, and...</i>

07:33.060 --> 07:35.060
The rush of emotion is...

07:35.660 --> 07:37.380
it's overwhelming.

07:37.420 --> 07:40.540
- I can imagine.
- No, no, you can't.

07:40.740 --> 07:41.740
No.

07:42.580 --> 07:43.460
I can't.

07:43.820 --> 07:45.780
John, I'd like you to try.

07:46.380 --> 07:49.740
Phoebus has a favor she'd like to ask of you.

08:00.980 --> 08:06.260
As I understand it,
the beam that hit Elizabeth was part of
a failsafe feature built into the pod's system.

08:06.300 --> 08:09.100
As cellular failure progressed, the pod...

08:09.140 --> 08:12.540
stored her consciousness in a sort of flash memory.

08:12.580 --> 08:16.820
But why? What good is the technology
if the effects are temporary?

08:17.300 --> 08:18.700
It's a black box.

08:19.060 --> 08:20.340
That makes sense.

08:20.460 --> 08:25.020
Even if the body is incapable of being revived,
the survivor can still report what happened to their ship.

08:25.060 --> 08:27.940
<i>A rescue team could interrogate them even if
they were incapable of regaining consciousness.</i>

08:27.980 --> 08:31.100
You're talking about a human flight recorder.
That's pretty dark.

08:31.300 --> 08:33.179
Pretty useful thing in times of war.

08:33.220 --> 08:37.780
It could also be the means for
two survivors to say one last goodbye.

08:40.780 --> 08:42.780
Are you sure she's up for this?

08:43.780 --> 08:46.380
Physically, she's perfectly fine.

08:46.780 --> 08:47.820
Besides...

08:47.860 --> 08:51.860
- Elizabeth wouldn't take no for an answer.
- Love is a powerful thing, Carson.

08:52.060 --> 08:55.820
- You're a hopeless romantic, you know that?
- Well, you're just as hopeless.

08:55.860 --> 08:58.020
Otherwise, you wouldn't have agreed.

08:58.060 --> 09:03.260
I've gone over their respective E.E.G. patterns,
and I can say with some degree of confidence that this...

09:03.300 --> 09:05.580
"imprinting," that Dr. Weir's...

09:05.740 --> 09:08.060
temporary occupant calls it...

09:08.100 --> 09:10.900
- won't last more than a few hours.
- You can guarantee that?

09:10.940 --> 09:12.300
<i>A day at most.</i>

09:12.340 --> 09:13.980
Well, I'm sold.

09:14.100 --> 09:15.500
Shall we?

09:15.580 --> 09:16.860
And...

09:24.820 --> 09:26.620
<i>He's still alive.</i>

09:28.500 --> 09:30.100
<i>Same as before.</i>

09:30.500 --> 09:33.100
Life signs even fainter than the first one.

09:33.140 --> 09:35.260
<i>If we're going to do this, we should do it now.</i>

09:35.300 --> 09:38.740
I'd prefer if this alien consciousness weren't armed.

09:38.900 --> 09:40.180
Right.

09:45.460 --> 09:47.020
<i>Colonel Sheppard...</i>

09:47.340 --> 09:50.140
you'll have to be in close proximity
to the pod for the transfer to happen.

09:50.180 --> 09:51.820
Yeah. Yeah, I know.

09:52.460 --> 09:53.980
But you're not moving.

09:54.020 --> 09:58.060
You know they were husband and wife.
Anything could happen.

10:00.380 --> 10:03.100
I promise to be discreet,
Colonel.

10:03.940 --> 10:05.100
Well...

10:05.140 --> 10:06.660
I guess...

10:06.900 --> 10:09.300
I'll see you guys later.

10:09.340 --> 10:10.820
Have fun.

10:22.580 --> 10:24.540
Give him a moment.

10:30.340 --> 10:31.580
Thalan...

10:32.340 --> 10:33.420
it's me.

10:35.060 --> 10:36.580
Phoebus?

10:36.780 --> 10:40.100
It's alright. These people recovered our pods.

10:44.260 --> 10:47.980
We may well be the very last of our kind.

10:48.340 --> 10:52.420
These generous people have allowed us
to be together one last time.

10:55.780 --> 10:57.500
You consented to this?

10:57.540 --> 10:59.500
One last chance...

10:59.900 --> 11:02.660
to say goodbye to my husband.

11:18.420 --> 11:20.980
That's not what I expected.

11:21.620 --> 11:25.660
I know this body is different,
but I assure you, Thalan, it's me.

11:26.820 --> 11:28.780
Is it possible for us to be alone,

11:28.820 --> 11:31.540
- just for a few minutes?
- No, absolutely not.

11:31.580 --> 11:35.780
- Oh, don't be so heartless.
- Look, they are two consenting adults...
- That's not what I'm concerned about, Doctor.

11:36.220 --> 11:39.820
- The colonel is right.
- Dr. Weir is in charge of this facility.

11:39.860 --> 11:42.700
I'm just saying there should be
an armed guard just outside the door.

11:42.780 --> 11:43.900
Two guards.

11:44.500 --> 11:45.300
One at each door.

11:45.340 --> 11:48.020
I've already taken that precaution.
They're right outside.

11:48.100 --> 11:49.780
Of course they are.

12:00.060 --> 12:01.660
Security to lab three!

12:04.020 --> 12:06.420
Rodney, don't shoot! That's colonel Sheppard!

12:06.460 --> 12:08.020
I'm sorry! I...

12:09.220 --> 12:12.100
You two need some very
serious marriage counseling.

12:12.140 --> 12:15.940
He's not my husband, he's the enemy.
Drop your weapon.

12:18.220 --> 12:21.340
Now radio security and tell them everything is fine.

12:21.380 --> 12:23.580
Everything's not fine.

12:26.060 --> 12:27.340
Rodney?

12:27.380 --> 12:29.180
Security, this is Dr. Rodney McKay.

12:29.220 --> 12:31.100
Everything is fine. Never been better.

12:31.140 --> 12:34.540
- Colonel Caldwell was kidding when
he said what he said...
- Oh, forget it.

12:38.100 --> 12:39.140
This is Dr. Weir.

12:39.180 --> 12:40.580
Attention, all personnel.

12:40.580 --> 12:46.700
Colonel Sheppard is not,
I repeat, not who he pretends to be. If you find him,
secure the area and contact me immediately.

12:46.740 --> 12:48.900
I'll deal with him myself.

12:58.020 --> 13:01.540
- Heard there was trouble.
- Yes, major. It's colonel Sheppard. He's not himself.

13:01.580 --> 13:05.740
- What exactly does that mean?
- It means he's a threat to the city.
We have to find him. Your team's with me.

13:05.780 --> 13:07.220
Yes, ma'am.

13:14.940 --> 13:16.620
We have a medical emergency in lab three.

13:16.660 --> 13:17.420
You alright?

13:17.460 --> 13:18.660
Stunner blast. I'm fine.

13:18.700 --> 13:19.460
What happened?

13:19.500 --> 13:20.940
She was playing us from the beginning.

13:20.980 --> 13:23.100
- Weir?
- Sheppard too. It's both of 'em now.

13:23.500 --> 13:26.580
Control room, patch my radio
through to security teams only.

13:26.900 --> 13:27.980
This is Caldwell.

13:28.620 --> 13:33.100
Both Dr. Weir and colonel Sheppard are under
the influence of alien entities. If at all possible...

13:33.140 --> 13:35.980
subdue and contain them with non-lethal force.

13:36.020 --> 13:37.540
We can track them down faster.

13:37.580 --> 13:39.140
There's a medical team on its way.

13:39.180 --> 13:39.980
Go.

13:46.060 --> 13:47.060
You know,

13:47.100 --> 13:50.340
it would help a lot if
we knew more about what was going on.

13:53.620 --> 13:54.700
Ma'am...

13:58.700 --> 14:00.940
I'm gonna need you to hand over that weapon.

14:01.660 --> 14:06.180
Did it occur to you that colonel Caldwell might
be under the same influence as colonel Sheppard?

14:06.220 --> 14:07.420
You weren't there.

14:08.540 --> 14:09.940
Hand over the weapon.

14:10.460 --> 14:11.660
Now.

14:13.100 --> 14:14.780
I guess you leave me no choice.

14:42.780 --> 14:43.460
Report.

14:43.660 --> 14:45.300
We just lost contact with major Lorne.

14:45.340 --> 14:49.340
Alright, I want all non-essential
personnel to return directly to their
quarters and remain there until notified.

14:49.380 --> 14:51.500
The only people I want moving through
the city are my security teams.

14:51.540 --> 14:52.020
Yes, sir.

14:52.060 --> 14:54.420
We may be able to track their progress
using the life signs detectors.

14:54.460 --> 14:56.860
How? They'll read as human. You
won't be able to differentiate...

14:56.900 --> 14:58.460
security teams travel in groups of two or more.

14:58.500 --> 15:01.380
They'll be the only individual
signals traveling through the city.

15:02.060 --> 15:02.900
<i>Let's go.</i>

15:04.420 --> 15:05.180
What are you waiting for?

15:05.220 --> 15:08.260
Look, I don't want to get all
"chain of command" on you here, but

15:08.300 --> 15:10.020
I am a senior member of this expedition,

15:10.060 --> 15:12.020
so with Elizabeth and colonel Sheppard
out of the equation, then...

15:12.060 --> 15:13.220
- I'm in charge.
- No, no, no, no.

15:13.260 --> 15:16.180
See, I don't think that's technically true, because
you're here for, what, like, one week out of six?

15:16.220 --> 15:19.660
Is it possible that because I was host
to a Goa'uld, you don't trust me, Doctor?

15:19.700 --> 15:20.500
I didn't say that.

15:20.540 --> 15:24.460
I'm the highest-ranking military officer here,
and this is clearly a military situation.

15:24.500 --> 15:26.220
Does that clear things up for you?

15:29.820 --> 15:30.740
Fine.

15:32.820 --> 15:34.420
Weir to Sheppard.

15:35.380 --> 15:37.180
I'm assuming you can hear me.

15:37.460 --> 15:41.260
Yeah, I can hear you, but if we keep using
these radios, it'll only help them find us.

15:41.980 --> 15:43.380
<i>We don't have much time, Thalan.</i>

15:43.420 --> 15:45.900
The imprinting is temporary,

15:46.100 --> 15:48.460
and these people are gonna try to stop us.

15:48.900 --> 15:51.580
We've got all the time in the world, and
there's only one of them I'm worried about.

15:51.620 --> 15:53.940
<i>We both want a shot at the same thing.</i>

15:54.140 --> 15:55.660
You mean each other.

15:56.180 --> 15:59.780
And neither one of us will get
that chance if you keep running.

16:00.740 --> 16:03.780
Sir, I'm picking up some chatter
I think you'll want to hear.

16:03.820 --> 16:05.180
Put it on speaker.

16:06.020 --> 16:07.380
<i>You're the one who likes to run.</i>

16:07.420 --> 16:09.820
<i>My ship ran out of fuel before
I could even get a clean shot.</i>

16:10.700 --> 16:11.660
That was my plan.

16:11.700 --> 16:13.020
<i>You didn't have a plan.</i>

16:13.060 --> 16:14.140
You just wanted me dead.

16:14.340 --> 16:15.140
<i>Still do.</i>

16:15.580 --> 16:20.820
As a matter of fact,
I can't wait to see that look of defeat on your face

16:20.940 --> 16:22.260
just one last time.

16:22.700 --> 16:26.940
You mean the look on my face when you rammed my
fighter, making sure neither one of us would win?

16:26.980 --> 16:29.020
That was hatred, not defeat, Phoebus.

16:29.060 --> 16:31.380
Is that any way to talk to your wife?

16:31.940 --> 16:33.020
Thalan?

16:35.500 --> 16:36.780
Run all you like,

16:37.500 --> 16:39.020
<i>but the moment I find you...</i>

16:39.220 --> 16:40.620
<i>you die.</i>

16:41.020 --> 16:43.340
Well, they're headed straight for divorce.

16:43.380 --> 16:44.700
That whole thing was a ruse.

16:44.740 --> 16:47.460
In fact, I doubt very much if we
were ever speaking with Dr. Weir.

16:47.500 --> 16:49.380
It was a remarkable impression, I'll give you that.

16:49.420 --> 16:52.340
From the sound of it, we have two fighter
pilots who don't know that their war's over.

16:52.380 --> 16:54.100
<i>It is much worse than that.</i>

16:54.140 --> 16:55.980
They know everything about this city...

16:56.020 --> 16:58.300
I mean, the layout, defensive systems,
how to access weapons...

16:58.340 --> 17:01.220
we just need to find a way to stop
them without unduly harming the hosts.

17:01.260 --> 17:02.780
"Unduly"?
What does that mean?

17:02.820 --> 17:05.260
Well, obviously, some force may be necessary.

17:49.620 --> 17:51.180
Contact any teams that may be offworld.

17:51.220 --> 17:53.820
Let them know that we're suspending
all gate activity until further notice.

17:53.860 --> 17:55.380
We're going to full alert status.

17:55.900 --> 17:58.140
I think I just located one
of them near the power room.

18:02.220 --> 18:03.380
Are you kidding?

18:16.220 --> 18:17.100
How'd she know?

18:17.140 --> 18:18.380
Intuition.

18:18.860 --> 18:20.860
Alright, we need to split up. I'll
take Sheppard. You go after Weir.

18:20.900 --> 18:21.580
Why?

18:21.620 --> 18:24.460
Because I know how he thinks. I don't
have the slightest clue how she thinks.

18:24.780 --> 18:25.780
Very well.

18:29.140 --> 18:29.860
What happened?

18:29.900 --> 18:33.500
The whole city just went dark.
Tell me you had someone guarding the power room.

18:33.540 --> 18:34.860
Two marines from Daedalus.

18:34.900 --> 18:36.860
Hutchinson, this is Caldwell. Report.

18:46.260 --> 18:47.180
Where's auxiliary power?

18:47.220 --> 18:48.780
Naquadah generators aren't kicking in.

18:48.820 --> 18:50.460
He or she must've damaged the backups.

18:50.500 --> 18:51.380
We've lost everything?

18:51.420 --> 18:54.220
Shields, communications,
long range and biometric sensors...

18:54.260 --> 18:56.420
The sensors from the Daedalus.
If we can contact them...

18:56.460 --> 18:58.580
Subspace communications are also down.

18:58.620 --> 19:01.580
I need you for you to get down to the power
room, Doctor. Restore primary systems.

19:01.620 --> 19:03.180
I should go along, too.
Marines could be hurt.

19:03.220 --> 19:05.740
Exactly. Marines may have been injured.
We can't go down there.

19:05.780 --> 19:08.380
I will send two of my people
along with you, just in case.

19:08.420 --> 19:10.620
How do we know that Sheppard isn't
down there waiting in ambush?

19:10.660 --> 19:12.740
Because he's not trying to kill us.
He's trying to kill Dr. Weir.

19:12.780 --> 19:16.540
- Oh, that is so much more comforting.
- This is not a request, Dr. McKay!

19:18.220 --> 19:20.500
Let me know the moment
you have a damage assessment.

19:21.780 --> 19:22.700
Well, go!

19:31.060 --> 19:31.860
Ronon?

19:33.980 --> 19:34.980
You in there?

19:36.740 --> 19:37.700
Ronon?

19:38.780 --> 19:39.660
You there?

19:44.060 --> 19:46.660
<i>Look, I came here looking for you, buddy, so...</i>

19:46.900 --> 19:49.580
<i>don't shoot or you'll ruin my entire plan.</i>

19:52.020 --> 19:53.620
What did Caldwell tell you?

19:55.580 --> 19:57.620
<i>That you're not who you say you are.</i>

19:57.660 --> 19:59.380
Yeah, well, consider the source.

19:59.460 --> 20:02.380
<i>If there are two alien entities
running around, it's him and Weir.</i>

20:02.420 --> 20:03.700
<i>I'm the good guy here.</i>

20:03.980 --> 20:05.780
So who cut the power?

20:08.100 --> 20:09.660
Okay, I admit, that was me.

20:09.700 --> 20:10.700
<i>Why?</i>

20:10.740 --> 20:12.340
I'm just trying to stay alive here.

20:13.260 --> 20:17.300
<i>Caldwell is giving the orders, and you're the
only one I can trust not to shoot me on sight.</i>

20:18.100 --> 20:19.300
What about Weir?

20:19.500 --> 20:20.900
<i>Her you can shoot.</i>

20:21.180 --> 20:25.500
And by shoot, I mean stun, and
only because she's not herself.

20:27.540 --> 20:28.980
Can you prove you're you?

20:29.540 --> 20:30.660
No, I can't.

20:36.140 --> 20:39.060
- What would Sheppard watch on TV?
<i>- No, that won't work.</i>

20:39.100 --> 20:39.980
<i>Why not?</i>

20:40.020 --> 20:43.820
Because if there was an alien consciousness
in my head, he'd know the answer was football.

20:45.100 --> 20:47.860
- But only Sheppard would admit that, so...
<i>- Right.</i>

20:50.980 --> 20:51.980
Look,

20:52.020 --> 20:53.020
just help me

20:53.060 --> 20:55.740
find her before they do.
That's all I'm asking.

20:57.500 --> 20:58.780
Give me the gun.

21:00.700 --> 21:01.900
Can I keep my stunner?

21:02.780 --> 21:03.780
<i>Yeah.</i>

21:45.780 --> 21:48.740
Well, the good news is the ZedPM is still intact.

21:48.780 --> 21:49.780
And the bad?

21:49.980 --> 21:54.540
Well, the control systems have been
damaged by some well-placed weapons fire.

21:54.580 --> 21:56.140
How soon till it's operational again?

21:56.180 --> 21:58.140
I just got here. I have no idea.

21:58.180 --> 21:59.380
<i>Report when you can.</i>

22:02.540 --> 22:03.980
Alright...

22:09.220 --> 22:10.220
She's not here.

22:10.260 --> 22:11.140
Keep moving.

22:31.980 --> 22:34.060
Sorry, buddy, plan didn't work.

22:34.180 --> 22:37.540
She got away because all I had
was this stupid little thing.

22:42.100 --> 22:43.500
At least you're out of the way.

22:44.300 --> 22:44.860
You're not...

22:45.420 --> 22:47.100
<i>Not Sheppard, no...</i>

22:47.500 --> 22:51.900
but I tell you what, he is screaming
in my head right now like you wouldn't believe.

22:53.660 --> 22:55.820
Medical team to the south port cargo hold.

22:55.860 --> 22:57.500
You have a man down.

23:11.580 --> 23:13.140
Who called in the man down?

23:13.140 --> 23:15.660
I don't know, sir, but it
sounded like colonel Sheppard.

23:15.980 --> 23:19.580
Alright, send in a medical team, but tell
them to be careful not to walk into an ambush.

23:19.700 --> 23:20.820
McKay, report, please.

23:21.820 --> 23:22.780
Still working.

23:22.820 --> 23:26.860
It doesn't have to be pretty, Doctor.
Just get the primary systems up and running again.

23:26.900 --> 23:28.900
Yeah, that is what I'm doing.

23:29.140 --> 23:32.660
Instead of running after them with bloody
guns, why don't you try talking to them?

23:32.700 --> 23:33.820
<i>And say what?</i>

23:33.860 --> 23:35.460
I don't know. Just stall them.

23:35.500 --> 23:39.220
We know it's only a matter of time before
Dr. Weir and colonel Sheppard are themselves again.

23:39.260 --> 23:41.020
Yeah, I'll take that under advisement, Doctor.

23:41.060 --> 23:43.260
In the meantime, I think you
should return to the infirmary.

23:43.300 --> 23:44.660
I'm sending you a patient.

23:44.700 --> 23:45.780
On my way.

23:45.820 --> 23:48.100
Rodney, I could use some light down there as well.

23:48.140 --> 23:49.780
Yes. Working.

24:20.620 --> 24:22.580
He was unconscious when we found him.

24:22.620 --> 24:23.900
He's been shot.

24:23.980 --> 24:26.940
I can see that, son.
Now go drum us up a few more torches.

24:27.100 --> 24:28.780
Flashlights. Off you go.

24:29.260 --> 24:31.100
Bloody dark ages.

24:31.340 --> 24:32.340
Gloves.

24:37.820 --> 24:39.700
Colonel Caldwell, this is Teyla.

24:39.740 --> 24:42.460
I'm at the base of the central
tower, tracking Dr. Weir.

24:42.500 --> 24:44.180
Understood. I'll send reinforcements.

24:44.220 --> 24:45.900
I can handle Dr. Weir...

24:46.900 --> 24:48.300
but if she is here...

24:49.900 --> 24:52.020
Colonel Sheppard is also close by.

24:57.260 --> 24:59.580
Just a little more light over the wound.

25:00.020 --> 25:01.780
Thank you, dear.

25:02.500 --> 25:03.700
Come on.

25:04.380 --> 25:06.500
There it is. You little bugger.

25:08.540 --> 25:09.860
One bullet.

25:14.540 --> 25:16.180
Now to stop the bleeding.

25:53.620 --> 25:56.380
Will you people stop getting in the way?

26:03.540 --> 26:06.980
Go ahead and expend all your ammunition,
just like you did last time!

26:07.380 --> 26:09.420
<i>Your people don't know how to fight, Phoebus.</i>

26:09.740 --> 26:11.940
That's why we're going to win the war!

26:13.740 --> 26:15.540
This war is not over yet!

26:24.980 --> 26:28.580
Colonel Caldwell, I'm ready
to attempt a partial power-up.

26:28.620 --> 26:29.900
Give me everything you've got, Doctor.

26:29.940 --> 26:32.780
I have report of automatic weapons fire
and Teyla's not answering her radio.

26:32.820 --> 26:33.820
Here we go.

26:44.100 --> 26:46.100
Of course now they come on.

26:46.220 --> 26:50.580
Right, let's get him under a scanner.
I want to make sure I didn't miss any tissue damage.

26:51.300 --> 26:52.620
<i>Lovely work, everyone.</i>

27:03.900 --> 27:05.980
There's more than one way in, Phoebus.

27:27.740 --> 27:29.500
- Now what the hell is going on?
- I don't know.

27:29.540 --> 27:32.060
Sections of the city have begun
automatically sealing themselves off.

27:32.100 --> 27:32.900
Move.

27:48.900 --> 27:49.900
It's not letting me override.

27:49.940 --> 27:54.660
Because the moment the power came back up, she used
a remote computer terminal to take control of the city.

27:57.380 --> 27:59.820
She's put us into a total
lockdown under her command code.

27:59.860 --> 28:00.860
Can you invalidate her code?

28:00.900 --> 28:03.740
Maybe I could have before the lockdown,
but the command's already been given.

28:03.780 --> 28:05.940
Look, somebody should have thought of that?

28:05.980 --> 28:07.860
You mean I should have thought of that?

28:07.900 --> 28:10.060
Can you hack it somehow override her code?

28:10.260 --> 28:11.820
You do know who you're talking to?

28:11.900 --> 28:12.900
So that's a yes?

28:12.940 --> 28:15.300
I'm just saying if anyone can, I can.

28:15.340 --> 28:16.140
I helped design the system.

28:16.180 --> 28:17.420
Then do it, please.

28:17.460 --> 28:18.900
Alright, but I'm using my command code.

28:18.940 --> 28:20.540
Why, because you still don't trust me?

28:20.580 --> 28:24.300
No, because it is a 16-digit
alphanumeric code that I will have to enter

28:24.340 --> 28:27.220
God knows how many times and
I haven't got around to memorizing yours yet.

28:27.260 --> 28:30.860
Just get me control of the city back.

28:31.220 --> 28:32.540
Fine.

28:35.500 --> 28:37.420
Caldwell, can you hear me?

28:37.660 --> 28:38.620
Go ahead.

28:38.660 --> 28:41.660
<i>By now you're aware the city
is entirely under my control,</i>

28:41.700 --> 28:45.820
and there are several bulkhead doors
between me and your nearest search team.

28:45.860 --> 28:47.820
<i>You can't possibly get to me.</i>

28:48.260 --> 28:49.940
Yes, we're well aware.

28:49.980 --> 28:54.140
<i>I'm sure Dr. McKay believes he can override
my command code, and it's possible.</i>

28:54.620 --> 28:58.420
In a matter of several hours, he could,
but I don't have that kind of time.

28:59.100 --> 29:00.900
We'd be more than happy to wait this out.

29:01.340 --> 29:07.020
Who knows what kind of trouble I could
cause with life support while I wait.

29:07.060 --> 29:09.740
Or maybe I'll just send
a signal to the Wraith

29:09.780 --> 29:10.860
like you did.

29:12.540 --> 29:13.900
What do you want?

29:15.100 --> 29:16.860
I want Sheppard.

29:17.620 --> 29:20.020
Well, I'm sorry I can't help you with that,
Is there something else I can do for you?

29:20.060 --> 29:23.020
Don't screw with me, Caldwell,
at the very least, I can kill Weir.

29:26.300 --> 29:28.180
When you get him, contact me.

29:28.820 --> 29:30.500
<i>Colonel Caldwell.</i>

29:31.740 --> 29:35.860
We have three signals on two separate
floors at the base of the tower.

29:36.020 --> 29:39.460
Weir has to be the one in the science lab,
which leaves these other two over here.

29:39.660 --> 29:40.780
The other one is Teyla.

29:41.220 --> 29:42.980
And the other one has to be Sheppard.

29:43.020 --> 29:44.860
<i>Teyla, this is Caldwell.</i>

29:46.700 --> 29:48.900
I was unable to capture Dr. Weir.

29:48.940 --> 29:49.860
<i>So were a lot of people.</i>

29:49.900 --> 29:52.140
<i>Weir's put the city under a lockdown.
I want you to go after Sheppard.</i>

29:52.180 --> 29:55.180
<i>You and he have been locked into
the same section. He's one floor up.</i>

29:56.700 --> 29:59.780
I will contact you as soon as I have him.
Teyla out.

30:04.060 --> 30:06.140
Is this what you wanted, Phoebus?

30:06.180 --> 30:08.220
Another stalemate?

30:08.340 --> 30:10.620
I thought you wanted to finish this.

30:10.820 --> 30:12.580
<i>What's wrong, Thalan?</i>

30:12.620 --> 30:14.220
<i>You can't get out?</i>

30:31.100 --> 30:32.060
This is Teyla.

30:32.100 --> 30:33.580
I have colonel Sheppard.

30:33.620 --> 30:36.260
Good work, Secure him and
stand by for further instructions.

30:36.700 --> 30:38.460
The next move is hers.

30:47.700 --> 30:49.940
Caldwell, do you have him or not?

30:49.980 --> 30:51.940
<i>I'm losing patience.</i>

30:52.060 --> 30:53.180
I'm working.

30:53.420 --> 30:54.260
We're working on it.

30:54.300 --> 30:55.740
<i>I don't buy it, Colonel.</i>

30:55.780 --> 30:57.180
Well, I'm telling the truth.

30:57.220 --> 30:58.620
Oh, please.

30:58.660 --> 31:00.980
Even Weir thinks you're hopeless.

31:01.060 --> 31:02.580
She can't hide it.

31:03.540 --> 31:04.740
We're close.

31:05.140 --> 31:06.740
We're not close.

31:07.180 --> 31:15.940
I have found an interesting way of rerouting your
new halon fire suppression system all the way
from hazmat storage to personnel quarters.

31:17.260 --> 31:21.900
<i>Now, that's where the majority of
your city's population is holed up, isn't it?</i>

31:22.620 --> 31:23.660
You know it is.

31:24.940 --> 31:29.460
Ironically, Dr. Weir was concerned when
the system was installed that halon gas

31:29.500 --> 31:33.140
extinguishes people as well as fires.

31:33.580 --> 31:34.380
<i>So...</i>

31:34.420 --> 31:38.300
<i>shall we take it to the point that I start
counting down from an arbitrary number?</i>

31:42.180 --> 31:44.340
We have him.

31:44.540 --> 31:47.100
I thought you might.

31:48.620 --> 31:53.620
There's a new security camera in the
northern most stairwell of that part of the tower.
I want him taken there so that I can see him.

31:53.660 --> 31:55.540
Kicking and screaming, if possible.

31:57.020 --> 32:00.140
Teyla, we've been requested to put the
colonel in front of the nearest security camera.

32:00.580 --> 32:02.580
I'm doing that right now, Colonel.

32:05.500 --> 32:09.860
I'm not surprised that you're the
only one that managed to get to him.

32:14.100 --> 32:14.900
What do you want?

32:14.940 --> 32:17.580
We're just going to wait
until he regains consciousness.

32:20.940 --> 32:22.220
Are you making any progress?

32:22.260 --> 32:23.340
Yes.

32:23.660 --> 32:24.860
Really?

32:25.380 --> 32:27.060
I would just like to state for the record

32:27.100 --> 32:30.020
that it is astounding to me that once
again I find myself in the position

32:30.060 --> 32:32.180
of having to save this city when you and your

32:32.220 --> 32:34.740
space marines can't figure
out how to track down two people.

32:34.780 --> 32:39.740
They're two people with the skills and resources of
Dr. Weir and colonel Sheppard, who probably
know this city better than anyone else,

32:39.780 --> 32:42.660
and also for the record, I was
against this from the very beginning.

32:42.700 --> 32:43.780
Yes...

32:44.820 --> 32:45.740
yes, you were.

32:45.780 --> 32:48.580
Thank you. Please, continue.

32:53.540 --> 32:55.420
He is regaining consciousness.

32:59.700 --> 33:02.260
Teyla, it's me.

33:05.300 --> 33:08.900
Do not waste your breath trying
to convince me you are John Sheppard.

33:08.940 --> 33:10.300
I do not believe you.

33:10.340 --> 33:11.540
Don't you see what they're doing?

33:11.580 --> 33:13.980
They're pitting us against each other.
You know me.

33:14.020 --> 33:15.180
<i>Oh, please.</i>

33:15.220 --> 33:17.140
<i>You call that acting?</i>

33:18.780 --> 33:19.740
Phoebus.

33:21.900 --> 33:24.900
There's that look of defeat I love.

33:24.940 --> 33:27.660
Sir, I have colonel Sheppard on my screen.

33:27.820 --> 33:29.260
<i>Wrong again.</i>

33:29.300 --> 33:30.580
Still hatred.

33:30.620 --> 33:32.620
I guess I'm satisfied with this.

33:32.980 --> 33:34.500
Teyla?

33:37.180 --> 33:37.980
Yes?

33:38.500 --> 33:39.580
Kill him.

33:45.980 --> 33:47.340
Don't listen to her.

33:47.380 --> 33:52.540
Kill him now, or I vent halon fire suppressant
into all the living spaces in Atlantis.

33:52.740 --> 33:55.060
- McKay?
- I know, I know. I'm almost done here.

33:55.500 --> 33:57.420
<i>Colonel, can she do this?</i>

33:57.460 --> 33:57.940
Yes.

33:58.020 --> 34:01.700
She's created a shunt between the fire
suppressant system and life support.

34:02.700 --> 34:04.020
<i>I believe so.</i>

34:04.140 --> 34:05.940
How many people are at risk?

34:06.300 --> 34:08.500
<i>Three-quarters of the expedition.</i>

34:12.500 --> 34:14.179
Why are you doing this?

34:14.780 --> 34:19.219
I have spent my entire life
at war with his world.

34:20.139 --> 34:23.219
Thousands have died with no hope for victory,

34:23.260 --> 34:27.020
both sides reduced to a mere handful of fighters.

34:27.860 --> 34:30.380
If he really is the last...

34:31.659 --> 34:34.460
then in the end, my people will have won.

34:36.420 --> 34:37.620
Don't believe her.

34:37.659 --> 34:41.580
Believe me when I say I have
absolutely nothing to lose.

34:41.620 --> 34:46.100
In a very short time, I will feel
excruciating pain, this body will convulse,

34:46.139 --> 34:49.020
and I will cease to exist.

34:50.500 --> 34:52.900
That's what is ahead for me.

34:53.219 --> 34:57.780
All I can hope for now is
to achieve victory for my people.

34:58.500 --> 35:01.860
Phoebus, your people are long dead.

35:01.900 --> 35:05.500
Who lost or won a war so many
years ago it does not matter.

35:06.260 --> 35:08.900
It matters to me.

35:12.740 --> 35:14.620
If you kill me...

35:15.100 --> 35:16.900
you kill him.

35:20.220 --> 35:22.300
He cares for you more than you know.

35:26.740 --> 35:29.660
- Please do not make me do this.
- You don't have to.

35:29.700 --> 35:34.740
Shoot him, or I release the gas and
just hope it reaches the both of you.

35:36.300 --> 35:38.820
<i>She has the capability
of doing what she claims.</i>

35:39.180 --> 35:39.980
Teyla...

35:43.900 --> 35:45.620
I'm not going to tell you what to do.

35:45.900 --> 35:47.220
<i>I am.</i>

35:47.780 --> 35:49.220
Kill him.

36:15.140 --> 36:17.420
Sheppard doesn't believe you'll do it.

36:24.380 --> 36:25.780
Forgive me, John.

36:28.340 --> 36:29.100
I've got it!

36:29.140 --> 36:30.340
I'm overriding her code now.

36:30.380 --> 36:31.020
Are you sure?

36:31.060 --> 36:31.980
It's done! Go!

36:32.020 --> 36:35.540
Teyla, this is Caldwell. Do not fire.
I repeat, do not fire.

36:47.020 --> 36:49.420
Can you maintain the lockdown in
the science lab, keep Weir where she is?

36:49.460 --> 36:51.340
Nope. The only way to do it was to override everything.

36:51.380 --> 36:53.460
Nobody's in control now.
She is long gone.

36:53.500 --> 36:55.500
All security teams, this is Caldwell.

36:55.540 --> 36:57.740
<i>Resume your search for Dr. Weir.</i>

36:58.500 --> 36:59.580
Teyla!

36:59.860 --> 37:01.060
Come on.

37:02.580 --> 37:04.340
You can't leave me like this.

37:06.060 --> 37:07.860
I will not let her harm you.

37:08.900 --> 37:11.540
You don't know how determined she is.

37:15.340 --> 37:17.380
You can't let her win.

37:20.540 --> 37:22.020
He is going into convulsions.

37:22.060 --> 37:23.860
Do not release him,
no matter what happens.

37:44.060 --> 37:45.260
Teyla?

37:46.260 --> 37:47.780
Is that really you?

37:48.780 --> 37:50.700
You're never going to believe me, so...

37:50.740 --> 37:53.380
I'm not even gonna try.

37:55.100 --> 37:57.700
Stand away from him
and up against the wall.

37:58.740 --> 38:00.260
He is unconscious.

38:01.260 --> 38:05.380
I don't know how many bullets I have left
in this thing, or I would have already shot you.

38:05.420 --> 38:07.700
I said back off!

38:18.500 --> 38:21.100
Unconscious or not...

38:22.460 --> 38:24.100
I want to see his face.

38:38.420 --> 38:39.420
You alright?

38:39.460 --> 38:40.500
Yes.

38:40.700 --> 38:41.420
It is over.

38:41.460 --> 38:44.620
Sorry we took so long. We got
stuck in that damn corridor for two hours.

38:44.660 --> 38:47.220
Call a medical team and have
them both taken to the infirmary.

38:47.260 --> 38:47.980
You got it.

38:48.020 --> 38:50.340
This is Lorne.
I need a medical team to my location, now...

38:50.380 --> 38:53.580
- How'd you know it was me?
- I still do not.

38:53.620 --> 38:57.380
Keep his hands bound until
Dr. Beckett tells you otherwise.

38:58.620 --> 39:01.340
If you didn't know,
why'd you give me the stunner?

39:01.780 --> 39:05.540
Because you would have shot her either way.

39:17.460 --> 39:18.860
Good morning.

39:23.740 --> 39:25.140
Good morning.

39:26.340 --> 39:29.460
What's-her-name
sure hung in there for a while.

39:29.580 --> 39:30.540
When did she...

39:30.580 --> 39:32.420
Sometime in the middle of the night,

39:32.460 --> 39:34.380
kicking and screaming.

39:37.900 --> 39:39.420
That... that was...

39:39.900 --> 39:43.180
the strangest feeling, no?

39:44.420 --> 39:48.900
The entire time, I was shouting to everyone, but
nothing I wanted to would come out of my mouth.

39:48.940 --> 39:50.020
I know.

39:50.220 --> 39:51.660
It was a real nightmare.

39:52.140 --> 39:53.620
Especially when you shot Ronon.

39:54.420 --> 39:56.660
- Oh, God, but I wasn't...
- I know. I know.

39:57.020 --> 39:58.260
It was her.

39:58.500 --> 39:59.860
How is he?

39:59.900 --> 40:01.300
He's fine.

40:01.340 --> 40:04.100
Teyla and Rodney just went
to see him in post-op.

40:05.900 --> 40:07.740
Did they believe you were...

40:08.020 --> 40:08.980
you?

40:09.700 --> 40:10.900
To be honest,

40:10.940 --> 40:13.780
I think the only people
who believe 100% are Beckett...

40:14.860 --> 40:16.060
you...

40:17.500 --> 40:18.740
<i>And me.</i>

40:19.780 --> 40:22.700
In fact, I can safely say that I know how you feel.

40:23.220 --> 40:24.780
Yes, sir.

40:25.300 --> 40:26.780
Thank you, Colonel,

40:26.820 --> 40:29.860
for keeping a potentially explosive
situation under control.

40:29.900 --> 40:32.980
Yeah, well, it was a lot closer
than I would like to admit.

40:33.020 --> 40:35.100
For what it's worth...

40:35.460 --> 40:38.780
- McKay says you did a good job.
- Did he?

40:39.020 --> 40:40.060
Well...

40:40.300 --> 40:42.660
maybe there's still hope for me yet.

40:43.180 --> 40:44.100
Oh, God, no.

40:44.140 --> 40:46.660
- Don't believe anything she might have said...
- I'm kidding.

40:47.100 --> 40:48.420
Don't give it another thought.

40:48.460 --> 40:53.420
Well, if you'll excuse me, I'm sure you'll
both agree that the paperwork on
this is going to be a nightmare.

40:53.460 --> 40:56.380
Especially that kiss.

40:58.140 --> 40:59.500
Yes, sir.

40:59.740 --> 41:03.100
Well, try not to kill each other while I'm gone.
