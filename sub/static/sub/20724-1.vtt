01:13.580 --> 01:14.741
What does this say?

01:14.940 --> 01:16.783
Does it say, "I grabbed it
outta my suitcase

01:16.860 --> 01:18.100
"and went to the beach"

01:18.260 --> 01:20.422
or "Girl who overplans
for vacation outfits"?

01:20.580 --> 01:21.876
There's just a picture
of a bird on it.

01:21.900 --> 01:22.901
It doesn't say anything.

01:23.940 --> 01:26.102
No, I mean, like,
its vibe, you know?

01:26.220 --> 01:28.029
Like, what's its vibe?
Oh.

01:28.100 --> 01:29.750
It's perfect for Ecuador.

01:29.900 --> 01:32.062
Yeah. And, like,
why Ecuador?

01:32.220 --> 01:34.871
Because we didn't want to
go somewhere touristy.

01:35.020 --> 01:37.546
We're not just, like,
a couple of white assholes.

01:37.700 --> 01:38.940
No offense.

01:39.100 --> 01:40.261
I really need it.

01:40.420 --> 01:43.071
I just want to, like,
sip a Mai Tai

01:43.260 --> 01:46.469
and smoke a J, and
then just kinda, like

01:46.620 --> 01:48.463
start having red wine at night.

01:48.620 --> 01:49.860
And then Scotch.

01:50.060 --> 01:51.300
And if somebody's like,

01:51.420 --> 01:52.626
"Have you ever done
ayahuasca?"

01:52.780 --> 01:55.624
I'll be like,
"No, is it safe?"

01:55.780 --> 01:57.589
And then I'll try it.
I don't care.

01:57.740 --> 02:00.220
And are things ideal,
financially, right now?

02:00.380 --> 02:02.747
No. The answer is no.

02:02.900 --> 02:04.948
But will things pick up?

02:05.100 --> 02:06.784
One thousand percent.

02:06.940 --> 02:09.227
Did I tell you Michael's band
is blowing up right now?

02:09.380 --> 02:10.426
Yeah.

02:10.580 --> 02:11.661
So, yeah, basically

02:11.820 --> 02:14.426
you know, money won't be
an "ish" much longer.

02:14.580 --> 02:16.150
This is a good color
for me, right?

02:16.340 --> 02:18.229
So, did you guys have this
in my size?

02:19.140 --> 02:21.268
Yeah, no.

02:21.660 --> 02:22.661
Sorry.

02:22.820 --> 02:23.981
Okay.
Thanks, anyway.

02:24.180 --> 02:25.261
Have fun on your trip.

02:25.420 --> 02:26.467
Nice meeting you.

02:26.620 --> 02:27.826
I hope you find your keys.

02:27.940 --> 02:29.180
Oh, my keys. Fuck!

02:29.620 --> 02:31.349
This would be cute on me if...

02:34.820 --> 02:35.981
Are you serious?

02:36.140 --> 02:37.141
What's up?

02:37.300 --> 02:39.476
You are supposed to be selling
clothes to the customers.

02:39.500 --> 02:40.501
Not to yourself.

02:40.660 --> 02:42.503
And what are you even doing
on the floor?

02:42.660 --> 02:44.788
I'm re-racking
clothes

02:45.340 --> 02:46.785
You know what? You're fired!
What?

02:46.940 --> 02:48.101
I'm done.
No, no, no.

02:48.260 --> 02:50.706
I need this job. Can
you just think about this?

02:50.860 --> 02:51.980
Look at the other employees.

02:52.100 --> 02:55.070
Like, what about this bitch?
I've never seen her do shit.

02:55.220 --> 02:56.267
You don't do shit here!

02:56.460 --> 02:57.507
She doesn't work here.

02:57.620 --> 02:58.621
Oh, okay.

02:58.780 --> 03:00.908
Hi. Thank you so much
for coming in.

03:01.060 --> 03:02.346
Look, can we just
talk about this

03:02.420 --> 03:04.140
when I get back from
my vacation to Ecuador?

03:04.260 --> 03:05.386
Vacation?

03:05.540 --> 03:07.781
You never even asked
for time off.

03:08.420 --> 03:10.343
And I'm realizing that
right now, okay?

03:10.420 --> 03:11.751
And it's because I forgot.

03:11.900 --> 03:12.981
Get out!

03:13.140 --> 03:15.268
God! You know what?
I don't need this job.

03:15.420 --> 03:17.627
I'm gonna go have
a sick time in Ecuador.

03:17.780 --> 03:18.781
You have fun here,

03:18.900 --> 03:22.188
with all your shirts
and your hours.

03:22.340 --> 03:23.421
Because I don't need it.

03:23.580 --> 03:24.911
I'm about to kick your ass.

03:25.060 --> 03:26.141
Takin' this.

03:26.300 --> 03:27.790
Put the damn hat down!

03:28.100 --> 03:29.876
I looked her right
in the eye, and I went

03:29.900 --> 03:32.665
"I wouldn't work here
if you paid me."

03:32.820 --> 03:34.902
And I just stormed out.
Just like, for real.

03:35.100 --> 03:36.989
Like, "Bye."
Another one will come.

03:37.140 --> 03:38.187
Right?
Yeah.

03:38.380 --> 03:40.076
You know what? I'm not gonna
talk about that anymore.

03:40.100 --> 03:41.386
I wanna focus on you and me

03:41.540 --> 03:44.020
on the beach.
Are you with me?

03:44.180 --> 03:46.342
I can't go to South America.

03:46.820 --> 03:48.700
What are you talking about?

03:48.780 --> 03:50.464
I can't go to Ecuador.

03:50.620 --> 03:52.668
You know it's a
non-refundable trip, right?

03:52.820 --> 03:54.345
I don't want to make it
about money

03:54.500 --> 03:55.706
because money comes and goes,

03:55.780 --> 03:58.147
but I don't have any more
coming right now, so

03:58.300 --> 04:00.029
I'm breaking up with you.

04:02.620 --> 04:03.621
<i>When'?</i>

04:04.660 --> 04:08.665
Like, right now. This is it.
You're in the middle of it.

04:09.260 --> 04:10.785
Is it because you're afraid

04:10.860 --> 04:12.596
because things are going
so great between us?

04:12.620 --> 04:14.304
That's what this is!
No.

04:14.420 --> 04:15.956
You're terrified, because
you've never felt this way

04:15.980 --> 04:16.981
about somebody before.

04:17.100 --> 04:18.101
I know what's happening.

04:18.260 --> 04:19.671
I'll tell you what it is.
Okay.

04:19.820 --> 04:22.471
The band is really blowing
up right now, you know?

04:22.540 --> 04:23.541
I know.

04:23.660 --> 04:26.470
And I'm going like this.
I'm taking off, all right?

04:26.620 --> 04:27.951
Okay.
And this is you.

04:29.300 --> 04:30.631
Just on the ground.

04:31.180 --> 04:32.909
I'm up here, too.
No, you're not up there.

04:33.100 --> 04:34.625
Why can't I go up there?
No, stop.

04:35.820 --> 04:37.470
I'm going this way.
I'm with you.

04:37.620 --> 04:39.031
Well, I'm going that way now.

04:39.180 --> 04:40.306
Now, I'm over there.

04:40.460 --> 04:41.905
I'm going.
You can't reach.

04:41.980 --> 04:43.141
My hand's over there.

04:43.300 --> 04:44.461
Look.
This is the thing.

04:44.660 --> 04:47.869
Where I'm going, there's
gonna be a ton of...

04:48.020 --> 04:49.590
Inspiration.
Pussy.

04:50.300 --> 04:51.631
Inspiration?
No, pussy.

04:51.780 --> 04:52.827
I keep talking over you,

04:52.940 --> 04:54.436
but it's sounding like
you're saying...

04:54.460 --> 04:55.460
Pussy.

04:55.580 --> 04:56.580
I heard it that time.

04:56.620 --> 04:57.621
You heard it?

04:57.780 --> 05:00.147
You always say
music inspires you.

05:00.300 --> 05:01.506
Pussy inspires me.

05:01.660 --> 05:02.786
I have a pussy.

05:02.860 --> 05:04.146
You have one pussy.

05:04.340 --> 05:07.310
But there's gonna be, like,
hundreds of other pussies.

05:07.460 --> 05:10.111
What about just my pussy,
hundreds of times?

05:10.940 --> 05:12.510
That's not as inspiring.

05:12.660 --> 05:14.636
You don't want to lose us.
You don't want to lose this.

05:14.660 --> 05:15.786
No. Just no.

05:17.700 --> 05:19.065
All right, this is the thing.

05:19.180 --> 05:20.830
You don't have
any direction in life.

05:21.460 --> 05:22.666
What does that mean?

05:22.820 --> 05:24.504
It means you're not
going anywhere.

05:24.620 --> 05:25.985
You're not doing anything.

05:26.140 --> 05:29.030
You know what? I am
so sorry, honestly

05:30.380 --> 05:33.304
I'm sorry, but I want
to see other people.

05:33.460 --> 05:34.700
Excuse me?

05:34.860 --> 05:36.385
You're great

05:36.660 --> 05:38.549
but I have a lot
going on right now.

05:38.700 --> 05:40.509
Yeah, I'm heartbroken.

05:40.700 --> 05:42.589
You're gonna meet
someone so special.

05:42.740 --> 05:44.151
Okay, I'm gonna go.
Bye.

05:44.500 --> 05:46.025
I want you to leave!

05:47.020 --> 05:48.704
You get out of here.

05:54.540 --> 05:57.350
Okay, one more for you.

05:58.540 --> 06:01.271
Yeah, not for you, Andrew.
You blew it.

06:01.420 --> 06:03.388
<i>Hey, it's Emily.
Leave</i> a <i>message.</i>

06:03.580 --> 06:05.025
Ah, Em! Listen, honey,

06:05.100 --> 06:06.545
I want you to be really careful

06:06.660 --> 06:08.947
because there was some kind
of heist in Delaware.

06:09.100 --> 06:11.706
Yeah, and I know you're in
New York and everything

06:11.860 --> 06:13.862
but you can never be
too safe, honey.

06:52.940 --> 06:54.305
Okay. All right.

06:56.460 --> 06:58.383
Okay, guys.

06:58.580 --> 07:00.309
Let's go to bed.

07:41.980 --> 07:42.981
What?

07:44.700 --> 07:46.031
What? No!

08:26.100 --> 08:27.704
Thank you. There you go.

08:39.380 --> 08:40.745
Oh!

08:42.020 --> 08:44.227
Poor thing!
You look awful.

08:44.860 --> 08:45.861
Thank you.

08:46.060 --> 08:47.903
Who the hell
does he think he is?

08:48.100 --> 08:49.780
How do you know I didn't
break up with him?

08:49.860 --> 08:50.986
Did you?

08:51.060 --> 08:52.061
No.

08:52.220 --> 08:53.220
Of course not.

08:53.260 --> 08:54.705
All right, this is a long hug.

08:54.900 --> 08:56.345
I know.
One more minute.

08:56.500 --> 08:57.716
I haven't seen you in,
like, forever.

08:57.740 --> 08:59.822
Can we just move this hug along?

09:01.860 --> 09:02.986
Hello, Philip.

09:04.220 --> 09:05.710
Okay, honey.

09:05.860 --> 09:08.147
So you can stay here
for as long as you want.

09:08.220 --> 09:09.301
Carte blanche, okay?

09:09.380 --> 09:11.826
I definitely have
to go back tonight.

09:11.900 --> 09:13.061
Oh, tonight, right?

09:13.220 --> 09:14.426
Tonight, I'm going back.

09:14.540 --> 09:16.383
All right.
Well, do what you want.

09:16.540 --> 09:18.065
Thank you.
We're in the kitchen.

09:18.420 --> 09:20.866
Oh, Jeffrey's home?
What a shock.

09:21.020 --> 09:22.020
Okay, don't start!

09:22.060 --> 09:23.141
What?

09:23.260 --> 09:25.422
Agoraphobia is not a joke.

09:25.580 --> 09:27.821
Mama, Mama, Mama... Oh.

09:27.900 --> 09:29.106
Hey, Em.

09:29.260 --> 09:30.261
I thought you were Mom,

09:30.340 --> 09:32.036
'cause you guys have, like,
the exact same voice.

09:32.060 --> 09:33.425
Okay.
No, we don't.

09:33.580 --> 09:35.020
You have the exact same
haircut, too.

09:35.060 --> 09:36.500
You know who you have
the haircut of?

09:36.540 --> 09:38.065
Who's that?
Harry Potter.

09:38.180 --> 09:41.024
Harry Potter is the greatest
of all the wizards.

09:41.180 --> 09:42.784
He's a hero
and a great role model.

09:42.860 --> 09:44.430
So, I'll take it
as a compliment.

09:45.420 --> 09:47.024
Mom, can I have
a chocolate milk?

09:48.780 --> 09:50.942
Oh, God, Mama! Mama!

09:51.100 --> 09:52.943
Yeah?
Very cold!

09:53.100 --> 09:54.261
I didn't heat it up.

09:54.460 --> 09:55.586
It's bread temperature.

09:55.740 --> 09:57.716
Maybe three to four minutes
and get it nice and toasty?

09:57.740 --> 09:59.310
We could toasty-toasty!

09:59.460 --> 10:01.622
Don't ask Mom to toast
your bread for you!

10:01.780 --> 10:03.589
What? ls something wrong
with your legs?

10:03.740 --> 10:05.556
They're in a seated position.
She's already up.

10:05.580 --> 10:07.469
I'll put the butter on myself.
Thank you, Mama.

10:07.580 --> 10:09.230
Wow, you're gonna
butter it yourself?

10:09.300 --> 10:10.436
Yeah, I'm gonna
butter it myself.

10:10.460 --> 10:12.781
Does Mom feed you like a
baby bird when I'm not here?

10:12.980 --> 10:15.142
I eat plenty. Don't worry
about my diet. Don't!

10:15.260 --> 10:17.020
Mama! She's showing me
her food in her mouth.

10:17.140 --> 10:19.791
No, I'm not, Mom. I'm
chewing like a person.

10:19.940 --> 10:21.076
Then she opened her mouth
and showed it to me.

10:21.100 --> 10:22.261
He's lying again.

10:22.380 --> 10:23.541
Hey, guys!

10:23.740 --> 10:25.265
This is supposed to be fun.

10:25.420 --> 10:27.229
I know what's going on
with you, man.

10:27.300 --> 10:28.381
Ah, please.

10:28.460 --> 10:30.276
You got shot through the heart.
Okay, Michael's gone.

10:30.300 --> 10:31.301
Ew.
And it sucks.

10:31.500 --> 10:33.620
Because you know what? He was
the best you'll ever do.

10:33.740 --> 10:35.504
Mom, can I eat upstairs?
No!

10:35.660 --> 10:37.660
I would like to eat right
here with you, Mom. Mama.

10:37.780 --> 10:38.827
You're so gay for Mom.

10:38.980 --> 10:39.981
I'm not gay for Mom.

10:40.100 --> 10:41.100
You're gay for Mom!

10:41.140 --> 10:42.790
She's a woman.
She has a vagina.

10:42.940 --> 10:44.180
You suck Mom's dick.

10:45.660 --> 10:48.311
Guys! Cool it!

10:48.460 --> 10:50.189
If you keep this up,
I'm not cooking anymore

10:50.340 --> 10:51.910
and I'm not feeding you.

10:52.100 --> 10:53.181
Stop it.

10:53.820 --> 10:55.822
Truce.
Truce.

10:56.020 --> 10:57.431
Arthur!
Here, kitty, kitty.

10:58.460 --> 11:01.191
Honey, have you seen Arthur?
Did he get out?

11:01.340 --> 11:02.865
He's right there.

11:03.380 --> 11:04.905
Oh, good.
Hi, okay.

11:05.300 --> 11:06.347
Does he ever move?

11:06.500 --> 11:07.911
Sweetie, want to watch a movie?

11:08.060 --> 11:09.585
I don't care, Mom.

11:09.740 --> 11:11.071
Oh, honey,
I know you feel so sad.

11:11.580 --> 11:14.550
But everything is going
to get better, honey.

11:15.180 --> 11:17.182
I'll tell you, when Dad left

11:17.700 --> 11:20.226
I thought I would
never have sex again.

11:21.060 --> 11:22.346
And I was right.

11:22.980 --> 11:23.981
What?

11:24.140 --> 11:26.871
But I tell you,
I am really, really relieved

11:26.980 --> 11:28.823
that you are not going
on that trip.

11:29.580 --> 11:31.105
Who said I'm not going
on that trip?

11:31.220 --> 11:32.665
I'm definitely going
on that trip.

11:32.900 --> 11:34.036
I'm just trying to pick
which friend

11:34.060 --> 11:35.141
to bring with me right now

11:35.220 --> 11:36.949
because, like,
everybody wants to go.

11:37.060 --> 11:38.060
Okay.

11:38.100 --> 11:39.716
I can't deal with you
evaluating my life right now.

11:39.740 --> 11:40.980
Can we just take the night off?

11:41.020 --> 11:42.067
I'm not in a place.

11:42.220 --> 11:43.221
I get it.

11:44.540 --> 11:46.508
Enough.
Don't do that.

11:50.060 --> 11:52.904
Okay, Shadee, how about
instead of rent this month,

11:53.020 --> 11:54.101
hear me out

11:54.260 --> 11:58.549
you cash in on a free trip
to Ecuador?

12:00.620 --> 12:02.031
Come on!

12:02.180 --> 12:04.103
Aren't you, like, from there?

12:06.020 --> 12:09.024
Uh, no, you're the one
who sounds racist, actually.

12:09.740 --> 12:12.471
Wow, you jumped to the
C-word pretty fast!

12:13.380 --> 12:14.791
How rude is that?
Oh, shit.

12:14.940 --> 12:16.305
Mom!

12:16.700 --> 12:18.225
Can I borrow a shirt?

12:18.380 --> 12:21.270
Sure, honey.
Go into the hall closet.

12:42.940 --> 12:45.625
<i>♪ Down on Cyprus Avenue</i>

12:47.900 --> 12:51.905
<i>♪ With a childlike vision
Leaping into view</i>

12:55.580 --> 12:59.266
<i>♪ Clicking, clacking

13:02.420 --> 13:06.186
<i>♪ Ford & Fitzroy,

13:07.660 --> 13:09.708
<i>Pack your bags.</i>

13:10.100 --> 13:11.989
You're going with me to Ecuador.

13:12.140 --> 13:14.461
Absolutely not. Not with my knees.
Not going.

13:14.660 --> 13:15.821
Yes, you are.
No!

13:15.980 --> 13:17.869
Mom! Look what
I just found.

13:18.420 --> 13:21.151
Look at how fun you were.

13:21.700 --> 13:24.465
Look at that! I can't
even believe that's you.

13:24.540 --> 13:26.110
Mmm-hmm.

13:26.180 --> 13:27.181
Look at this.

13:27.340 --> 13:28.341
Oh!

13:28.820 --> 13:31.187
That was a long time ago, honey.

13:31.700 --> 13:32.781
Ma

13:32.980 --> 13:34.982
This would be so great for you.

13:35.180 --> 13:38.389
Oh, everybody knows you need
two years to plan a vacation.

13:38.540 --> 13:40.190
No! What are you talking about?

13:40.340 --> 13:42.149
You don't do
anything fun anymore.

13:42.300 --> 13:43.381
Idol

13:43.500 --> 13:46.549
I go to the Y twice a week,
and I take sculpting class.

13:46.700 --> 13:48.350
I mean, look! Voila!

13:48.500 --> 13:50.821
Mom! I told you I would
not acknowledge that.

13:51.140 --> 13:53.347
That is not right. Okay?

13:53.460 --> 13:55.224
It's your home. You put
it where you want it,

13:55.340 --> 13:57.069
but it's an upsetting image.
Okay.

13:57.180 --> 13:59.342
Mom, look, I didn't
want to do this

13:59.900 --> 14:01.584
but here it goes.

14:03.140 --> 14:04.380
What?

14:04.500 --> 14:05.501
My trip...

14:05.580 --> 14:06.581
Yeah?

14:07.420 --> 14:10.390
Is non-refundable.

14:10.580 --> 14:12.025
Oh, my God!

14:12.180 --> 14:13.180
Yeah.

14:13.220 --> 14:15.905
You always book refundable,
Emily! Everybody knows that!

14:16.100 --> 14:17.306
I know, but...

14:17.380 --> 14:18.825
Look, it's done,

14:18.900 --> 14:20.823
and no one else will go with me.

14:20.900 --> 14:21.901
No one.

14:22.060 --> 14:24.711
But I booked a journey.

14:25.180 --> 14:26.944
And I refuse

14:27.060 --> 14:29.825
I refuse to let
Michael's decision

14:30.020 --> 14:32.387
dictate whether or not I,
as a woman

14:32.540 --> 14:33.746
go on this trip.

14:33.980 --> 14:36.028
I will embrace this challenge

14:36.180 --> 14:38.660
in the intrepid spirit

14:38.820 --> 14:41.300
of all the independent women

14:41.500 --> 14:42.581
who have come before me.

14:42.740 --> 14:43.901
All the single ladies!

14:44.060 --> 14:46.825
'Cause it's upon their
shoulders that I'm standing.

14:47.020 --> 14:49.626
No, I won't back down!

14:51.260 --> 14:52.591
No!

14:52.740 --> 14:55.061
So I stand before you
right now, Linda

14:55.260 --> 14:56.864
and I ask you

14:57.020 --> 14:58.226
will you

14:58.940 --> 15:01.546
Linda, my mother, Middleton

15:01.700 --> 15:02.861
join me

15:04.580 --> 15:06.230
on this pilgrimage?

15:12.380 --> 15:13.381
No.

15:14.420 --> 15:15.990
Non-refundable!

15:16.380 --> 15:17.984
Mom!
I can't.

15:18.420 --> 15:20.627
Help me put the "fun"

15:21.380 --> 15:23.951
in non-refundable.

15:44.820 --> 15:46.436
I actually kinda caught
a piece of you, Mom.

15:46.460 --> 15:48.462
Could you lean out a little bit?

15:49.980 --> 15:51.470
That's cute.

15:52.660 --> 15:53.661
Here, put this on.

15:53.820 --> 15:55.151
What is this? What?

15:55.260 --> 15:58.707
That is a rape whistle.

15:58.860 --> 16:00.191
That's a rape whistle.

16:00.380 --> 16:01.711
What?

16:01.820 --> 16:03.982
This is a dog whistle, Mom.

16:04.500 --> 16:05.500
Oh, well...

16:05.540 --> 16:06.956
Are you afraid these dogs
are gonna rape me?

16:06.980 --> 16:07.981
Is that the main concern?

16:08.140 --> 16:09.141
Can I just see that?

16:09.300 --> 16:10.904
I didn't look at the dogs.

16:10.980 --> 16:12.311
Do they look like
rapists to you?

16:12.380 --> 16:13.381
Whatever!

16:13.500 --> 16:15.502
Why don't you just
say, "Thank you, Mom"?

16:15.620 --> 16:16.667
Thank you.

16:16.820 --> 16:18.584
"I'm being raped by a dog."

16:20.700 --> 16:22.509
Oh, my God!

16:25.060 --> 16:26.221
It works.

16:27.660 --> 16:29.469
Wow! Mmm-hmm.
Huh?

16:33.660 --> 16:34.821
Welcome.

16:34.940 --> 16:36.021
Oh, thank you. Um

16:36.220 --> 16:38.188
That's check-in, right?
Welcome.

16:39.540 --> 16:42.862
No, no! Thank you so much.
No. Thank you.

16:45.340 --> 16:47.229
This is me.
Thank you.

16:49.700 --> 16:51.304
Oh, thank you very much.

16:52.220 --> 16:53.904
What's this?
Welcome!

16:56.180 --> 16:57.670
Ma'am!

16:57.820 --> 16:59.265
"Whale" what?

16:59.860 --> 17:01.430
"Welcome."
Oh!

17:01.580 --> 17:03.344
"Welcome."
I'm sorry. Honey!

17:03.420 --> 17:04.556
They're not serving up
whale semen.

17:04.579 --> 17:06.423
I'm so sorry.
I've got it, thank you.

17:06.540 --> 17:07.871
I know, but that was not good.

17:08.060 --> 17:09.868
Okay. And I have you
down for a king.

17:10.060 --> 17:11.903
Oh. Nope,
that's not right.

17:12.020 --> 17:13.545
I was supposed to be a king

17:13.700 --> 17:16.544
but one thing led to
another, and I changed it.

17:16.700 --> 17:18.190
So, it's two queens now.

17:18.339 --> 17:19.579
Are you sure you changed it?

17:19.780 --> 17:20.906
Yeah, I called ahead.

17:21.060 --> 17:22.903
I do see that note here.

17:23.060 --> 17:25.744
Okay, well, can you look
at that note

17:25.900 --> 17:28.186
and make that note happen?

17:28.339 --> 17:29.865
I'm sorry, I cannot.

17:30.020 --> 17:31.988
So I'm just gonna share

17:32.060 --> 17:34.028
a king-size bed
in a romantic locale

17:34.180 --> 17:35.545
with my mother?

17:35.700 --> 17:37.702
You can sleep
head-to-toe.

17:38.780 --> 17:40.748
Like we're 69-ing.

17:41.060 --> 17:42.585
Great.

17:43.260 --> 17:45.308
I know what that means,
you know. "69-ing."

17:45.460 --> 17:46.746
Really, Mom?
What does it mean?

17:46.900 --> 17:48.106
Don't test me.

17:58.620 --> 17:59.781
Hey.
Hi.

17:59.940 --> 18:01.271
You ate lunch without me.

18:01.420 --> 18:03.991
Oh, yeah. Sorry.

18:04.140 --> 18:05.301
And you got a drink.

18:05.460 --> 18:06.905
At 2:00 p.m.

18:07.100 --> 18:09.421
Mmm-hmm. Sure do.

18:09.660 --> 18:12.027
Hey, honey, you're gonna
break your toes in these.

18:12.100 --> 18:13.147
No, I'm not.

18:13.260 --> 18:14.756
These flip-flops are bad
for your feet.

18:14.780 --> 18:15.861
Okay, all right.
I know.

18:15.940 --> 18:17.749
I'm a grown woman, so I'm fine.

18:17.900 --> 18:19.061
But thank you.

18:19.260 --> 18:20.625
Why are you dressed like Powder?

18:21.300 --> 18:22.586
You look like a beekeeper.

18:22.740 --> 18:24.344
Just get some sun,
is what I'm saying.

18:24.500 --> 18:26.787
The sun is very dangerous.

18:31.780 --> 18:32.781
Mom!

18:32.940 --> 18:34.276
Okay, please.
I just want to fix this.

18:34.300 --> 18:35.381
You put so much on.

18:35.460 --> 18:37.540
I don't want you to get
melanoma in front of my eyes.

18:37.940 --> 18:39.624
Please.
Here. Here.

18:40.820 --> 18:42.822
Mom!

18:49.260 --> 18:50.989
So

18:51.140 --> 18:53.108
I'm just gonna read my magazine.

18:59.780 --> 19:01.020
Oh, that's nice.

19:02.540 --> 19:05.384
I didn't know they had a day
care program at the hotel.

19:07.140 --> 19:08.221
So, I don't get it.

19:08.380 --> 19:10.303
It's gross.
It is gross.

19:12.380 --> 19:13.791
Oh, God!

19:14.820 --> 19:16.902
Have you talked
to your dad lately?

19:17.020 --> 19:19.466
Mmm-mmm. I think he's still
in Florida with Susan.

19:25.020 --> 19:26.351
Let's go out tonight.

19:26.500 --> 19:27.831
What? No, I can't.

19:27.980 --> 19:30.187
Yeah, you and me.
We're going out.

19:30.340 --> 19:32.149
No, no, no.
Why?

19:32.300 --> 19:34.587
Hair, make-up, boobs.
We're going out.

19:34.740 --> 19:36.344
Come on.
Don't do this.

19:36.540 --> 19:40.340
Emily, I am not going strolling
in Ecuador at night.

19:40.540 --> 19:41.701
You're such
a scaredy-cat.

19:41.820 --> 19:43.185
This is what I'm talking about.

19:43.340 --> 19:44.516
You're gonna miss
this whole trip.

19:44.540 --> 19:46.224
Everything shouldn't be
so scary.

19:46.380 --> 19:48.303
Oh, it damn well should.

19:49.020 --> 19:50.624
Okay, thank you.

19:50.740 --> 19:53.266
Name's Ruth. Traveling with
my best friend, Barb.

19:53.420 --> 19:56.424
We usually go to the Arizona
Gem Show every year.

19:56.580 --> 19:59.390
But this year, Barb got
a deal on this resort.

19:59.540 --> 20:00.905
Well, enjoy it.

20:01.060 --> 20:02.266
Ecuador's a pretty place.

20:02.900 --> 20:04.390
No arguing that.

20:04.540 --> 20:06.030
But you can't
let your guard down.

20:06.180 --> 20:08.228
That is right.
That is exactly right.

20:08.380 --> 20:09.666
A lot of terrible things

20:09.740 --> 20:11.265
happen outside
these little gates.

20:11.420 --> 20:13.741
Exactly. See?
The world's a scary place.

20:13.900 --> 20:17.222
One in four tourists in
South America are kidnapped.

20:17.420 --> 20:18.581
What? Incredible!

20:18.700 --> 20:19.861
Not true.

20:20.020 --> 20:21.226
Totally true.

20:21.420 --> 20:24.310
One, two, three,
somebody's missing.

20:24.460 --> 20:25.460
It's false.

20:25.580 --> 20:26.581
Oh, my God.

20:26.740 --> 20:29.425
Anyway, Barb retired
last year. Oh, look!

20:29.580 --> 20:32.106
That's her over there.
Finally getting some peace.

20:32.260 --> 20:33.750
You know,
she was in special ops.

20:33.900 --> 20:35.550
And she's seen some shit.

20:35.700 --> 20:36.747
Hi, Barb!

20:37.420 --> 20:40.230
Special ops! Wow, that's
very interesting.

20:42.580 --> 20:44.867
Oh, don't bother
waiting for a response.

20:45.020 --> 20:48.103
Barb cut her own tongue out
when she left the service.

20:48.260 --> 20:49.341
Precautionary measures

20:49.420 --> 20:51.343
to prevent from
being interrogated

20:51.500 --> 20:53.423
for top secret information.

20:53.620 --> 20:55.031
Couldn't they just torture her

20:55.100 --> 20:57.467
into writing down
the information?

21:02.020 --> 21:04.022
Well, anyway, I best get going.

21:05.020 --> 21:07.910
Here's my number, in case you
guys want to grab dinner

21:08.060 --> 21:09.710
or lunch, or breakfast,
or a snack.

21:09.780 --> 21:11.020
Okay.

21:11.220 --> 21:13.302
Or just kinda sit, you know?

21:13.460 --> 21:14.541
Just sittin'.

21:14.700 --> 21:16.702
Thank you, Ruth.
Thank you so much.

21:16.860 --> 21:18.703
See you at dinner.

21:20.940 --> 21:22.226
- WOW.
- Well

21:22.780 --> 21:26.262
I'm going to be having a
lovely evening here tonight

21:26.420 --> 21:28.104
reading my novellas.

21:28.300 --> 21:30.621
Well, I'm going to get ready
and have a drink.

21:30.820 --> 21:32.390
What a shock.

21:56.180 --> 21:58.182
Hey, do you mind if I join you?

21:59.460 --> 22:00.950
Hey, that dude...

22:01.100 --> 22:02.670
Oh, no. Uh, sorry.

22:02.780 --> 22:03.781
You.

22:04.860 --> 22:06.510
Mind if I join you?

22:06.660 --> 22:09.345
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, come over.

22:09.500 --> 22:10.865
Please.

22:11.020 --> 22:13.022
Uh, not you. It was me.
Excuse me?

22:13.180 --> 22:15.626
Could you kind of beat it?
'Cause you're a distraction.

22:15.780 --> 22:17.669
Hey, how are you?
I'm James.

22:17.820 --> 22:18.981
Emily.
Hi, Emily.

22:19.140 --> 22:20.630
Nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you.

22:20.700 --> 22:22.031
What happened to your arm?

22:22.180 --> 22:24.180
Did you try to kill yourself
'cause you're so ugly?

22:25.620 --> 22:27.190
No, I, um

22:27.380 --> 22:29.382
I've just spent the past
few weeks in Koh Phangan.

22:29.460 --> 22:30.461
Mmm.

22:30.540 --> 22:32.827
And my last day there I kept
thinking about that quote

22:32.980 --> 22:34.664
"Man cannot discover new oceans

22:34.820 --> 22:38.063
"unless he has the courage
to lose sight of the shore."

22:38.780 --> 22:41.386
Wow, I love that you don't

22:41.460 --> 22:42.985
care about sounding
like a weirdo.

22:43.060 --> 22:45.062
Well, you know,

22:45.180 --> 22:47.069
I wanted a tattoo
to symbolize that

22:47.220 --> 22:50.303
but I'm pretty sure
I must have been wasted

22:50.380 --> 22:52.064
because I don't know
what Borat has to do

22:52.180 --> 22:53.181
with any of that.

22:53.340 --> 22:54.501
That is brutal.

22:54.660 --> 22:55.821
Yeah, it is.

22:55.980 --> 22:57.391
But, actually, I can beat that.

22:57.580 --> 22:58.741
Look at this.
Okay.

22:58.900 --> 23:01.062
I got this.
I was 18, okay?

23:01.220 --> 23:02.745
Look at that.
It's raised.

23:02.900 --> 23:04.584
Touch it, it's raised.
That is horrible.

23:04.740 --> 23:06.310
I got it at the worst place.

23:06.500 --> 23:07.620
And my skirt's over my head.

23:07.740 --> 23:08.741
Is that finished?

23:08.900 --> 23:11.904
I mean, people have
certainly finished on it.

23:12.060 --> 23:13.903
I'm sorry.

23:14.060 --> 23:15.156
I don't know
why I just said that.

23:15.180 --> 23:16.476
I'm trying to, like,
be funny for you.

23:16.500 --> 23:18.582
So, here you are.
How come you're here?

23:18.740 --> 23:20.344
I'm a model.
I'm here, modeling.

23:20.500 --> 23:22.867
So you're not here
with your boyfriend?

23:23.060 --> 23:24.107
Is he a model, too?

23:24.260 --> 23:26.103
Uh, no, I'm just here with, um

23:27.340 --> 23:28.341
my

23:29.940 --> 23:31.590
My mom.

23:31.900 --> 23:33.476
Hey, that's so crazy
you're here with your mom

23:33.500 --> 23:34.706
because I'm here with my mom.

23:35.340 --> 23:36.341
Really?

23:36.860 --> 23:38.066
No, absolutely not.

23:38.220 --> 23:40.951
That would be so sad,
because I'm an adult.

23:41.100 --> 23:42.750
It's pronounced "adult."

23:44.220 --> 23:46.222
You've been to Egypt?
What were you saying?

23:46.420 --> 23:47.706
No, yeah, I went to Egypt.

23:47.860 --> 23:49.624
I know it's kind of
dangerous right now.

23:49.780 --> 23:52.021
But, I've hiked up
mountains in Iran.

23:52.100 --> 23:54.307
I've run with the bulls
in Spain.

23:54.460 --> 23:57.031
I've eaten poisonous
blowfish in Japan.

23:57.220 --> 23:59.461
To me, those are the moments
that make life worth living.

23:59.900 --> 24:01.789
I love everything you're saying.

24:03.100 --> 24:04.989
Your Instagram must be insane.

24:05.140 --> 24:08.110
Oh, well, no. I'm not really
on any of those things.

24:08.260 --> 24:09.750
How can anybody see what you do?

24:10.260 --> 24:12.308
Well, they don't.
But I get to live it.

24:15.780 --> 24:18.226
Do you wanna do
something tonight?

24:19.100 --> 24:20.147
Like, something crazy,

24:20.260 --> 24:21.989
or can we do something amazing?

24:22.060 --> 24:23.061
Yeah!

24:23.220 --> 24:27.623
I'm sure we can rustle up
some adventure tonight.

24:27.820 --> 24:29.504
Yes!
Yeah.

24:31.140 --> 24:33.222
Everything okay
over here, Emily?

24:33.740 --> 24:35.469
I met them at the pool.
Oh, you guys.

24:35.620 --> 24:37.987
Remember, never have more
drinks than you have tits.

24:38.180 --> 24:39.341
Two tits, two drinks.

24:39.500 --> 24:40.786
I know how many tits I have.

24:40.940 --> 24:41.987
Please, go away.

24:42.180 --> 24:43.670
Did you just give me
danger eyes?

24:43.980 --> 24:45.540
I don't even know what
"danger eyes" is.

24:45.660 --> 24:48.027
I gave you get-the-fuck-outta
here eyes. Go away.

24:48.180 --> 24:49.511
It was like this.

24:49.660 --> 24:51.156
That's kind of a thing.
I didn't make that face.

24:51.180 --> 24:52.181
I think you...

24:52.340 --> 24:53.341
That's danger eyes.

24:53.460 --> 24:54.460
Go.

24:54.500 --> 24:56.025
Go away.

25:00.700 --> 25:01.861
Ride or die.

25:04.980 --> 25:06.869
Barb, you're wilin' out
right now.

25:07.300 --> 25:09.189
Thank you, Barb. Okay.

25:59.620 --> 26:00.781
<i>HEY-</i>

26:01.100 --> 26:02.306
<i>HEY-</i>

26:02.740 --> 26:04.504
That was not
what it looked like.

26:04.660 --> 26:08.187
I was just washing my vagina
in case we hooked up.

26:08.340 --> 26:09.830
That is what it looked like.

26:10.020 --> 26:11.306
Oh, okay.
Yeah.

26:11.460 --> 26:14.031
'Cause when I drink sometimes
it smells like soup.

26:14.180 --> 26:16.069
Hey, do you know what?
Shall we?

26:16.140 --> 26:17.426
Yeah?

26:18.100 --> 26:20.068
Hey, what kind of soup?

26:20.140 --> 26:22.347
Um, that is none
of your business.

26:22.420 --> 26:27.267
<i>♪ Let it all go
Come on, man, I already know</i>

26:27.620 --> 26:33.309
<i>♪ We gotta go fig up a riot
If we wanna fly free</i>

26:34.780 --> 26:39.388
<i>♪ Doggies and dolls

26:40.860 --> 26:45.309
<i>♪ Light up my fire

26:46.140 --> 26:48.620
<i>♪ Take me to the party ♪</i>

26:48.740 --> 26:49.866
Really? What? What?

26:51.340 --> 26:52.990
Slow down. You're like...

26:53.820 --> 26:55.026
Here we go.

26:55.300 --> 26:56.301
What is this?

26:56.460 --> 26:57.825
Check it out.

26:58.860 --> 27:00.783
No.

27:00.940 --> 27:02.908
On, my God!

27:02.980 --> 27:04.141
What do you think?

27:04.820 --> 27:06.151
I can't believe this.

27:06.260 --> 27:07.796
I know.
They just sort of pop up.

27:07.820 --> 27:09.424
Is this like a tree
or something?

27:09.540 --> 27:10.701
It is a tree.

27:10.980 --> 27:12.676
You're gonna know all these
people by the end of it.

27:12.700 --> 27:13.701
Yes.

27:13.820 --> 27:14.981
Hola!
Just two of those.

27:22.820 --> 27:24.060
That's capoeira.

27:50.500 --> 27:52.548
Oh, shit!

27:52.700 --> 27:54.700
Uh, I'm really sorry.
She's never done that before.

27:54.740 --> 27:55.741
Oh, my God.
Are you okay?

27:55.860 --> 27:57.340
I think you might have
killed the guy.

27:57.820 --> 27:59.151
Holy shit.
I'm sorry.

28:04.180 --> 28:05.909
Oh, this is nice.
Right?

28:06.060 --> 28:07.300
That's made of glass.

28:07.420 --> 28:08.581
Yeah, it is.

28:08.740 --> 28:10.708
And the elevator there
is made of steel.

28:10.820 --> 28:12.584
And you are okay
finding your room?

28:13.420 --> 28:14.831
Oh. Yeah.

28:15.020 --> 28:17.182
No, I had a buzz earlier.

28:17.340 --> 28:19.946
But it's gone now.

28:20.060 --> 28:21.869
Uh...

28:22.540 --> 28:24.383
Your tit's out.

28:25.900 --> 28:27.743
Your tit's out, too.

28:28.700 --> 28:30.748
No, your tit is actually

28:30.900 --> 28:31.947
emerged.

28:37.380 --> 28:39.064
I thought I felt a breeze.

28:40.420 --> 28:41.865
Will you excuse me?

28:42.020 --> 28:43.431
Oh, no.
Yeah, absolutely.

28:47.580 --> 28:50.629
God, I wish
I could invite you up.

28:50.780 --> 28:52.430
But I can't.

28:52.580 --> 28:54.423
I have to 69 my mom.

28:54.580 --> 28:56.423
Well, how about, then

28:56.580 --> 28:59.424
you set your alarm
for 9:00 a.m

28:59.580 --> 29:02.424
and we will go
on another adventure?

29:02.580 --> 29:05.424
Yeah! I would love it.

29:06.260 --> 29:08.228
Oh, shit.

29:08.380 --> 29:09.711
I got my mom.

29:09.860 --> 29:11.100
No, bring her.

29:11.260 --> 29:12.705
It'll be fun.

29:12.860 --> 29:15.067
Oh, my God! James!

29:15.180 --> 29:16.261
Thank you.

29:16.420 --> 29:18.196
That's all right. The
pleasure's gonna be mine.

29:18.220 --> 29:19.585
So, you get off to bed

29:19.660 --> 29:21.230
and I will see you tomorrow.

29:22.540 --> 29:24.702
I'll see you tomorrow, too.

29:42.140 --> 29:43.710
On!

29:55.740 --> 29:56.741
Sorry.

29:58.300 --> 30:01.304
Mom, I had the best night.

30:01.980 --> 30:04.062
I learned the capoa.

30:04.740 --> 30:07.823
You do that.
And I danced with a lady.

30:08.980 --> 30:09.981
I'm okay.

30:10.740 --> 30:12.822
And we twerked.

30:12.980 --> 30:14.266
Did you ever twerk, Ma?

30:14.420 --> 30:15.660
No.
It's easy.

30:15.820 --> 30:17.265
You just loosen your lower back,

30:17.340 --> 30:18.671
and you kind of jump.

30:18.820 --> 30:20.345
Are you getting it?
Yeah.

30:20.580 --> 30:22.469
I was doing it better before.

30:23.020 --> 30:26.183
What is this haunted swan
doing here?

30:26.340 --> 30:28.104
Scram, swan!

30:29.500 --> 30:30.865
Mom

30:31.700 --> 30:33.031
I met a man.

30:33.140 --> 30:34.471
Yeah?

30:34.660 --> 30:37.140
I met a real man.

30:38.180 --> 30:40.706
Well, drinking with a man
in a foreign country...

30:40.860 --> 30:44.546
You know? It's a smart,
responsible thing to do.

30:45.020 --> 30:46.181
Thank you.

30:46.380 --> 30:50.305
I know that that is
sincere, and I thank you.

30:50.860 --> 30:53.181
You missed a maleficent night.

30:53.340 --> 30:55.342
Well, I'm sorry.
Go to sleep.

30:55.500 --> 30:57.821
I can't get in.
It's too tight, Mom.

30:57.940 --> 30:58.941
Just, here...

30:59.060 --> 31:00.300
Just put your feet under there.

31:00.380 --> 31:01.461
It's so tight.

31:01.620 --> 31:02.756
It's tight,
but it will untighten.

31:02.780 --> 31:04.066
What are they trying to prove?

31:04.220 --> 31:05.267
Just go to sleep, honey.

31:05.380 --> 31:06.461
He's my soul mate.

31:06.620 --> 31:08.861
I know, I'm sure. Yeah, whatever.
Wait till tomorrow.

31:09.020 --> 31:12.024
He's gonna take us
on a day trip.

31:12.100 --> 31:13.545
Mmm-hmm.
And you're going.

31:13.740 --> 31:16.021
No, I'm not. I'm gonna read my
book, is what I'm gonna do.

31:16.100 --> 31:17.226
I've got ten pages left.

31:17.380 --> 31:18.950
Now that I'm awake.

31:19.700 --> 31:22.180
And hopefully you won't start
drunk-snoring till I'm done.

31:22.340 --> 31:23.990
Do you wanna know
how this book ends?

31:24.140 --> 31:25.585
I do. Absolutely.

31:25.660 --> 31:26.836
Then the only way
you're gonna find out

31:26.860 --> 31:27.907
is if you come tomorrow.

31:27.980 --> 31:29.789
This is my book now.
This is not your book.

31:29.860 --> 31:31.100
Yes, it is.
This is my book.

31:31.180 --> 31:32.716
You are too young
to be acting like this.

31:32.740 --> 31:35.505
Oh, really? Well, you're too
old to be acting like this.

31:35.580 --> 31:36.581
Now, give me my book!

31:36.700 --> 31:37.701
No!

31:37.780 --> 31:39.464
You're coming!

31:39.620 --> 31:41.304
You wanna know
how this ends, Linda?

31:41.380 --> 31:42.381
Yeah, I do.

31:42.460 --> 31:44.303
You will come tomorrow.

31:44.460 --> 31:45.825
What did you do?

31:46.020 --> 31:48.751
I've got 'em right here
in my chi-chas.

31:49.460 --> 31:50.461
Chi-cha?

31:50.620 --> 31:53.464
I'll see you and James tomorrow.

31:53.620 --> 31:54.860
God, Emily, this isn't fun.

31:54.980 --> 31:56.141
Good night.

31:59.460 --> 32:00.746
Oh!

32:00.820 --> 32:02.345
Emily, please.

32:02.540 --> 32:04.747
It was the swan.

32:16.660 --> 32:18.822
Ah!

32:31.580 --> 32:32.581
Ma!

32:32.740 --> 32:34.071
Is he looking at me?

32:34.740 --> 32:36.071
Is James looking?

32:36.180 --> 32:37.511
No, he's not.

32:37.700 --> 32:38.940
Here he comes.

32:40.220 --> 32:41.506
Here we go.

32:41.700 --> 32:43.145
Yes!
Here you go.

32:43.300 --> 32:44.870
Thank you!
Thanks.

32:45.620 --> 32:47.463
Hey, cheers!

32:47.620 --> 32:49.190
Ooh, cheers!
Cheers.

32:49.340 --> 32:50.387
What's in it?

32:50.540 --> 32:51.701
I wish I could tell you.

32:51.860 --> 32:53.476
He said it was a secret
family recipe or something.

32:53.500 --> 32:55.070
Oh, really?

32:55.300 --> 32:56.300
It's good.

32:56.420 --> 32:57.831
Do you guys mind
how we get back?

32:57.980 --> 32:59.876
'Cause I was thinking maybe we
could take the scenic route.

32:59.900 --> 33:01.311
We're gonna go past waterfalls.

33:01.380 --> 33:02.745
I always see about 12 rainbows.

33:02.900 --> 33:04.743
It's insane.
Or, if you want

33:04.900 --> 33:07.506
we could just take the old,
boring, dusty highway.

33:07.660 --> 33:09.549
I'll take the old,
dusty highway.

33:09.700 --> 33:11.111
What? Do you
hear yourself?

33:11.260 --> 33:12.864
Why are you
a life-ruiner?

33:13.020 --> 33:14.226
Do you know what?

33:14.380 --> 33:15.756
She is kind of right
'cause I think we'd save

33:15.780 --> 33:17.191
probably a whole

33:17.340 --> 33:18.751
five minutes.

33:19.060 --> 33:20.471
So...
Okay.

33:20.900 --> 33:22.265
Waterfalls and rainbows.

33:42.540 --> 33:44.144
Where the hell are we?

33:44.500 --> 33:47.106
Oh, we're just coming up
on a really beautiful view.

33:47.260 --> 33:50.150
Do you guys have any service?
I have, like, no bars.

33:50.300 --> 33:51.665
It's not letting me
post anything.

34:04.900 --> 34:06.584
All right. That's it.

34:06.740 --> 34:07.821
No more scenic route.

34:07.900 --> 34:09.356
Let's just get us
on the main road, please.

34:09.380 --> 34:10.666
Are you sure?

34:10.820 --> 34:12.310
I mean, this really is the way

34:12.420 --> 34:13.909
to experience the culture,
you know.

34:14.060 --> 34:15.061
No, thank you.

34:15.179 --> 34:16.181
Mom, it's fine.
I'm sure.

34:16.380 --> 34:17.905
No, it's absolutely not!

34:18.060 --> 34:20.904
Just get us out, you know,
back, okay? And now!

34:20.980 --> 34:22.036
I want you to do it right now.

34:22.060 --> 34:23.061
I'm so sorry.

34:23.260 --> 34:24.989
That's okay. Listen,
I'm really sorry, guys.

34:25.179 --> 34:26.396
I didn't mean to freak you out.

34:26.420 --> 34:28.502
Listen, I'm just gonna have
to turn around up here

34:28.659 --> 34:30.036
and then we'll get back
to the road.

34:30.060 --> 34:31.315
What was the name of that dance

34:31.340 --> 34:32.676
that we were doing
the other night?

34:32.699 --> 34:34.300
Mom, you should have seen it.
Oh, my God!

34:34.420 --> 34:35.751
Capoeira!
Capoeira!

34:59.380 --> 35:00.620
Oh, my God!

35:01.380 --> 35:02.586
Are you okay?

35:02.780 --> 35:03.781
Oh, my God!

35:04.420 --> 35:05.467
Where are we?

35:09.380 --> 35:11.382
Why would they take us?
Oh, my God!

35:12.140 --> 35:14.268
Oh, fuck! Ew. Ew.

35:14.420 --> 35:16.149
Mom, why aren't you talking?

35:16.300 --> 35:18.382
Because I'm trying
to remain calm.

35:20.220 --> 35:21.631
And when I think about
where we are

35:21.780 --> 35:23.236
and what's happening,
I start to panic.

35:23.260 --> 35:24.830
And I don't want to panic.

35:24.980 --> 35:27.904
So I have chosen to believe

35:27.980 --> 35:29.982
that I am reading
a very compelling article

35:30.140 --> 35:32.825
on local farming practices.

35:32.980 --> 35:34.664
What the fuck is that?
Is that porn?

35:34.820 --> 35:35.981
Because

35:36.140 --> 35:38.063
when I think about all this...

35:38.740 --> 35:39.901
I get upset!

35:39.980 --> 35:40.981
Oh, my God.

35:41.100 --> 35:44.502
So I'm moving on
to another article

35:44.660 --> 35:46.310
about this woman's asshole.

35:46.460 --> 35:47.507
Her asshole?

35:47.660 --> 35:49.424
Because I just don't know
what else to do.

35:49.500 --> 35:50.501
On, my God!

35:50.620 --> 35:51.636
Do you think James is okay?

35:51.660 --> 35:53.140
Do you think they're
holding him here?

35:53.620 --> 35:55.031
Oh, Emily, don't you know

35:55.140 --> 35:57.347
that James is part
of all this, honey?

35:57.500 --> 35:59.264
How can my daughter
be so foolish?

35:59.420 --> 36:01.661
How could she
just not know this?

36:01.860 --> 36:04.466
I am sorry that this happened.

36:05.020 --> 36:07.671
But I will get us
out of here, okay?

36:07.820 --> 36:09.265
I'm gonna call...

36:10.860 --> 36:12.862
Oh, my God.
They took my phone.

36:13.620 --> 36:16.021
Oh, my God, they took my phone!

36:16.340 --> 36:19.150
It's fine.
That's fine.

36:19.300 --> 36:20.870
We just gather raw materials.

36:21.020 --> 36:22.181
Okay, we...

36:22.380 --> 36:24.348
And we make a shiv.
I saw this.

36:24.820 --> 36:26.026
No.
I saw it. Yes!

36:26.220 --> 36:28.188
No. We fight, we lose.

36:28.340 --> 36:29.705
Holy shit!

36:30.340 --> 36:31.990
What are you
holy-shitting about?

36:33.700 --> 36:37.227
Oh, the blood on the wall?
Oh, well, that's there.

36:37.380 --> 36:40.031
Hey, how about the scorpion,
over there in the corner?

36:40.180 --> 36:43.070
What? Oh, my God!
It's a fucking scorpion!

36:43.220 --> 36:44.381
Mom, you have to kill it.

36:44.540 --> 36:46.190
I'm not gonna kill it.
Kill it!

36:46.340 --> 36:47.705
I can't kill it.

36:49.820 --> 36:51.743
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

36:51.860 --> 36:52.876
Where have you taken us?

36:52.900 --> 36:54.036
I have a few questions.

36:54.060 --> 36:55.824
We have a very
high-up family,

36:55.900 --> 36:57.186
and you're in a lot of trouble.

36:57.340 --> 36:59.183
What the fuck is this?

36:59.340 --> 37:01.308
That is heat-activated
birth control, sir,

37:01.420 --> 37:02.700
so please
keep that refrigerated.

37:03.060 --> 37:05.267
This was a day.
This was a day trip.

37:05.420 --> 37:07.582
I know, but I like to be
prepared. It's important.

37:07.740 --> 37:09.583
What's your PIN number?

37:10.060 --> 37:11.710
One

37:11.860 --> 37:12.861
two

37:14.260 --> 37:15.421
three

37:17.340 --> 37:18.341
four.

37:18.420 --> 37:19.421
Oh, God.

37:19.500 --> 37:20.911
I was gonna change it.

37:21.060 --> 37:22.744
Do you have husband?

37:22.940 --> 37:24.749
I am divorced.

37:24.940 --> 37:26.863
I also don't have a husband yet.

37:27.340 --> 37:29.911
What about Jeffrey?
My son, Jeffrey.

37:30.060 --> 37:34.429
Oh, my God. Our lives
depend on Jeffrey.

37:36.620 --> 37:38.463
Shit.
What you're doing is shit.

37:38.540 --> 37:40.224
It sucks.

37:40.580 --> 37:44.027
Okay, just think
about how to be better.

37:48.060 --> 37:49.221
You got Jeffrey.

37:49.420 --> 37:50.910
<i>Hello, Jeffrey.</i>

37:51.060 --> 37:53.791
We have your mother
and your sister.

37:53.940 --> 37:55.465
And you will now pay ransom.

37:55.620 --> 37:56.667
Pardon?

37:56.780 --> 37:57.861
<i>$100,000.</i>

37:58.060 --> 37:59.266
Wired by noon tomorrow.

37:59.420 --> 38:01.388
<i>Okay, I don't know who this is,</i>

38:01.540 --> 38:02.596
but if you keep pranking me,

38:02.620 --> 38:03.756
I will report it to the police.

38:03.780 --> 38:05.145
It will become a police matter,

38:05.220 --> 38:06.824
and you will go to jail.
Okay?

38:06.980 --> 38:09.221
I'm with Jacob right now.
It's his piano lesson.

38:09.300 --> 38:10.301
So fuck off.

38:10.420 --> 38:12.070
Unfortunately,

38:12.740 --> 38:13.821
for Linda and Emily

38:13.980 --> 38:15.141
<i>it is very real.</i>

38:15.300 --> 38:16.984
Await further instructions.

38:17.820 --> 38:20.585
Mama? Hello! Hello!

38:32.620 --> 38:33.826
On, my God.

38:43.820 --> 38:45.231
Not too bad.

38:45.860 --> 38:48.670
However, I have to move you,
and that is annoying to me.

38:48.860 --> 38:51.306
Fortunately, you have
not made me angry.

38:51.460 --> 38:54.350
Should you ever make me angry

38:55.380 --> 38:58.702
I will skin you alive
while your mother watches.

39:01.300 --> 39:02.904
What does that mean?
Oh, God.

39:03.060 --> 39:04.903
Oh, my God. No! No!

39:05.300 --> 39:06.540
Fight, Mom. Fight!

39:06.700 --> 39:07.701
Fight, Mom!

39:07.860 --> 39:10.022
Go limp. Go limp!

39:10.180 --> 39:11.750
No!
Go limp.

39:16.780 --> 39:18.305
I have a real phobia about this.

39:18.380 --> 39:19.950
Of what? Being locked
in a car trunk?

39:20.140 --> 39:22.427
Yeah, I think everybody's
got that one, Mom.

39:25.300 --> 39:27.100
Oh, my God!
I feel like I can get this.

39:27.220 --> 39:28.301
It's loosening.

39:29.020 --> 39:30.943
Hold on.
Wait, I think I got it.

39:31.100 --> 39:33.102
Oh! Okay.
Do me! Do me!

39:36.580 --> 39:38.025
No. I don't care.
Okay.

39:38.900 --> 39:40.106
Okay. It's off.

39:40.220 --> 39:41.460
Oh, my God.

39:46.900 --> 39:48.036
Oh, my God.
We're stopped.

39:48.060 --> 39:49.789
Okay, he's out.
What do we do?

39:49.860 --> 39:50.916
I saw this on Dateline once.

39:50.940 --> 39:51.996
These people were trapped
in a trunk,

39:52.020 --> 39:53.116
and they found these wires...

39:53.140 --> 39:54.316
Wait, wires?
I feel some wires.

39:54.340 --> 39:55.421
Just grab it?
Yeah.

39:55.500 --> 39:56.740
Should I pull it?
Yes.

39:57.060 --> 39:58.903
Oh!
Oh, we're out! Okay.

40:03.860 --> 40:04.907
Okay.

40:06.260 --> 40:08.786
Okay, this way, come on.

40:08.980 --> 40:10.664
Mom, what are you doing?
My knees.

40:10.740 --> 40:11.741
Keep UP!

40:11.860 --> 40:13.385
On, shit!

40:13.580 --> 40:15.548
I told you not to wear
your flip-flops!

40:15.740 --> 40:17.947
It wasn't
flip-flop related, Mother.

40:19.420 --> 40:20.706
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

40:26.660 --> 40:27.991
Oh, shit!
Go, Mom!

40:28.140 --> 40:29.221
Go!
Ola!

40:29.820 --> 40:30.821
On, my God!

40:31.340 --> 40:32.546
Mom! Come on!

40:32.700 --> 40:34.270
I'm trying!

40:36.900 --> 40:38.390
Come on!
I'm coming.

40:38.540 --> 40:39.916
Watch out, Mom!
He's right behind you!

40:39.940 --> 40:41.624
Emily!
Come on!

40:42.180 --> 40:43.306
Oh, my God.

40:44.060 --> 40:45.141
Come on!

40:48.820 --> 40:49.821
He's got my leg!

41:16.940 --> 41:17.941
We're stopped.

41:18.020 --> 41:19.916
This is the end of the line,
whatever that means.

41:19.940 --> 41:21.544
Come on, honey.

41:22.020 --> 41:24.068
Ma, do you think there's
any way that, like,

41:24.140 --> 41:25.665
maybe that guy's okay?

41:26.540 --> 41:28.349
I saw his brains.

41:28.500 --> 41:30.309
Why can't you just
make me feel better?

41:31.300 --> 41:33.541
Oh, my God.
Thank you so much.

41:33.700 --> 41:35.225
You are such a sweetie.

41:41.540 --> 41:43.304
What? Hector Morgado?

41:46.940 --> 41:48.101
This is...

41:48.260 --> 41:49.625
Honey, he's nervous.

41:51.980 --> 41:53.266
Wait, where are you going?

41:53.460 --> 41:54.586
Where are you going?

41:54.660 --> 41:56.071
Should we get back in here?

41:56.220 --> 41:57.631
What are we supposed to do?

41:58.980 --> 42:01.062
Okay, we gotta get
out of here. Let's go.

42:01.460 --> 42:03.940
What we need to focus
on is that we got out.

42:04.140 --> 42:05.636
I don't know
why I let you talk me

42:05.660 --> 42:06.900
into this in the first place.

42:07.100 --> 42:08.420
I should have stayed
at the hotel.

42:08.540 --> 42:10.827
I can't fight with you
right now. I'm starving.

42:11.020 --> 42:12.101
Do you hear my stomach?

42:12.180 --> 42:14.023
It's, like, crazy.
I'm so hungry.

42:15.420 --> 42:17.024
- Oh, my God.
- A phone!

42:17.180 --> 42:18.625
A turkey leg!

42:19.620 --> 42:21.065
Mmm-hmm,
hold on one second.

42:21.220 --> 42:23.188
State Department,
this is Morgan.

42:23.340 --> 42:25.196
Please listen
very carefully to me, sir.

42:25.220 --> 42:26.620
My mother and I
have been kidnapped.

42:26.940 --> 42:28.305
Mmm, okay,
where are you guys now?

42:28.460 --> 42:31.669
Puerto Matias.

42:31.740 --> 42:32.956
That's in southern Colombia.
Let me pull that up.

42:32.980 --> 42:34.505
Will you hold on for one second?

42:34.660 --> 42:36.500
They took us to Colombia.
It's fine, it's fine.

42:36.540 --> 42:38.349
It's just a different...

42:38.660 --> 42:39.866
ZIP code.
It's so far.

42:39.940 --> 42:40.941
Okay.

42:41.100 --> 42:42.676
Okay, go ahead and get out
a pencil and paper for me.

42:42.700 --> 42:44.828
And write down "Calle..."

42:44.980 --> 42:45.981
"Cali" What?

42:46.100 --> 42:48.751
Is this a tall building
that we need to get to

42:48.900 --> 42:50.470
so you can pick us up
on the top of it?

42:50.540 --> 42:51.716
That's the address
of the nearest

42:51.740 --> 42:53.026
US consulate in Bogota.

42:53.180 --> 42:56.389
Okay, but you have
to actually come get us

42:56.540 --> 43:00.101
because we are Americans
in peril. So...

43:00.180 --> 43:01.261
<i>I'm sorry to tell you,</i>

43:01.340 --> 43:02.516
<i>but any time you
travel internationally,</i>

43:02.540 --> 43:03.541
you take a risk.

43:03.620 --> 43:06.351
Most of Colombia is beautiful
and very safe now.

43:06.500 --> 43:07.990
<i>With the exception
of Puerto Matias,</i>

43:08.060 --> 43:09.630
<i>which is very much not.</i>

43:09.780 --> 43:11.066
<i>So trust no one.</i>

43:11.220 --> 43:12.221
Good luck.

43:12.300 --> 43:14.507
And thanks for calling
the US State Department.

43:19.460 --> 43:21.588
You talked to him.
What'd he say?

43:23.100 --> 43:25.467
I think we're gonna need
to make another phone call.

43:25.620 --> 43:27.145
We're gonna get you out of this.

43:27.260 --> 43:29.547
I don't know if you remember
me telling you this

43:29.700 --> 43:31.623
but Barb was in the special ops.

43:31.780 --> 43:34.101
So she's highly trained
for this type of situation.

43:34.260 --> 43:35.785
Let me tell you a story
about Barb.

43:35.980 --> 43:38.062
We're on a limited time card.
We really need...

43:38.220 --> 43:39.904
1991, Kuwait.

43:40.060 --> 43:41.266
Hot as fuck...

43:41.420 --> 43:43.582
Hello?

43:45.580 --> 43:47.548
On, my God.

43:47.740 --> 43:49.265
This place seems okay.

43:52.660 --> 43:53.661
Hi.

43:53.780 --> 43:56.590
Hi. When does
the next bus leave?

43:58.500 --> 44:00.741
Bus doesn't leave
for about 36 hours.

44:00.900 --> 44:01.981
Oh, my God.

44:02.140 --> 44:04.507
But I know a man
who can take care of you.

44:04.660 --> 44:07.061
Oh, yeah, I'm sure he could.
Mmm-hmm.

44:07.180 --> 44:09.182
This is how sex slavery
starts, honey.

44:09.340 --> 44:10.580
I'm so sorry.

44:10.740 --> 44:12.580
Listen, no. You don't
have to worry about that.

44:12.660 --> 44:14.700
Those kinds of people want
young, beautiful females.

44:14.780 --> 44:15.827
You're safe.

44:16.740 --> 44:18.868
Oh, well, yeah.
That's good.

44:19.020 --> 44:20.181
Okay, how dare you!

44:20.340 --> 44:22.263
Like, that is so rude.

44:22.420 --> 44:23.546
That's crazy.
Well, honey.

44:23.700 --> 44:25.300
No. Like, how dare you.
That's my mother.

44:25.420 --> 44:26.421
Honey, have a peanut.

44:26.500 --> 44:27.836
Okay, fine. But if you
think it would be safer

44:27.860 --> 44:29.271
for me to kind of, like

44:29.340 --> 44:30.865
go hide and then
she meets your friend

44:30.940 --> 44:32.116
who knows
how to get us to the...

44:32.140 --> 44:33.420
No, I don't want you to do that.

44:33.580 --> 44:35.230
No, you're both safe.

44:36.100 --> 44:37.181
How do you mean?

44:37.340 --> 44:39.024
Your poofy face
will protect you.

44:40.180 --> 44:42.501
But, over there,
that man is who I mean.

44:46.220 --> 44:47.381
Can I help you, ma'ams?

44:47.780 --> 44:49.225
He's American.
America!

44:50.540 --> 44:52.463
Oh, my God.
We're Americans. Hi.

44:52.620 --> 44:54.384
I'm Emily and this is Linda.
Hi, I'm Linda.

44:54.540 --> 44:56.144
You don't even understand
the ordeal

44:56.220 --> 44:57.460
that we have just been through.

44:57.500 --> 44:58.796
Yeah, I mean, we were kidnapped.

44:58.820 --> 45:00.276
We really need to
get to the US consulate in

45:00.300 --> 45:01.665
Bogota?
Right.

45:01.860 --> 45:02.956
As soon as possible, kind of.

45:02.980 --> 45:04.709
So, if you know the easiest way.

45:04.900 --> 45:05.981
The easy way?

45:12.020 --> 45:13.460
They were laughing
at something else.

45:14.220 --> 45:16.063
You're not going to find
that in Colombia.

45:18.220 --> 45:20.348
Ah, you've got mountain
ranges to the north.

45:20.540 --> 45:21.587
Mom, come on.

45:21.700 --> 45:23.862
Jungles to the east and west.

45:24.020 --> 45:27.422
And, well, the mighty one, the
river, she's to the south.

45:28.500 --> 45:30.025
There is no easy trek.

45:30.420 --> 45:31.990
There's a reason
they call Colombia

45:32.060 --> 45:33.710
"The sack of the jaguar."

45:33.860 --> 45:35.780
I never heard of that before.
I'll tell you what.

45:35.900 --> 45:37.460
I've got a slow boat,
headed down river.

45:38.060 --> 45:40.028
I can take you east
along the Amazon

45:40.100 --> 45:41.147
and stretch it up north.

45:41.300 --> 45:42.996
We should be able to
drop you off close enough

45:43.020 --> 45:45.220
that you can make it to Bogota
without too much trouble.

45:45.300 --> 45:46.301
Name's Roger Simmons.

45:46.380 --> 45:47.660
The boat's docked just out back.

45:47.740 --> 45:49.822
Crew's getting her seaworthy
as we speak. So...

45:49.980 --> 45:51.869
I'll check in with them
then come back for you.

45:52.020 --> 45:53.021
Thank you.

45:53.100 --> 45:54.101
<i>Señor!</i>

45:55.220 --> 45:57.302
Chicken wings for the ladies.

45:59.500 --> 46:00.911
You're safe with me.

46:01.660 --> 46:02.661
Thank you.

46:04.100 --> 46:05.465
Yeah!

46:05.620 --> 46:06.826
Slow boat!

46:06.980 --> 46:08.061
Slow boat.

46:08.140 --> 46:09.505
You wanna get the chicken wings?

46:09.660 --> 46:10.866
That'd be great.

46:21.220 --> 46:23.188
Ma, stop.
Don't, like, caress me.

46:23.340 --> 46:24.421
Oh, sweetie.

46:24.580 --> 46:26.708
You look just like you did
when you were three.

46:26.900 --> 46:28.868
Okay. You need to start
dating again.

46:28.940 --> 46:30.271
What?
Yeah, you do.

46:30.420 --> 46:32.866
Oh, please. Don't start
with this again.

46:33.020 --> 46:34.988
Why? I've been there, done that

46:35.140 --> 46:36.665
All right, I'm gonna pee.

46:36.820 --> 46:38.076
Don't let them
take the wings away.

46:38.100 --> 46:39.147
Okay, honey.

46:44.900 --> 46:46.106
Oh, my God. Help!

46:46.260 --> 46:48.103
Mom! Oh, my God! Ow!

46:51.740 --> 46:52.946
On, my God.

46:55.540 --> 46:56.541
That's him.

46:56.620 --> 46:57.826
That's the guy.
Oh, God.

46:58.420 --> 46:59.501
Hi, sir.

47:00.020 --> 47:01.021
Remember us?

47:01.140 --> 47:02.187
Shut the fuck up.

47:03.460 --> 47:06.066
Why did you come
to South America?

47:06.220 --> 47:07.516
I didn't want to come.
I never wanted to come.

47:07.540 --> 47:09.304
For the cultural experience

47:09.460 --> 47:11.144
and the Red Cross.

47:11.540 --> 47:12.701
You come down here

47:12.860 --> 47:14.350
you stay at your fancy resort

47:14.500 --> 47:16.662
clutching your pearls.

47:16.740 --> 47:18.116
Look at my people
like you are at the zoo.

47:18.140 --> 47:19.141
What the fuck?

47:19.540 --> 47:21.269
You offer nothing here to them.

47:21.420 --> 47:22.990
And you take everything.

47:23.860 --> 47:25.066
And then

47:26.860 --> 47:28.669
you kill my only nephew.

47:28.740 --> 47:29.821
Oh!

47:29.900 --> 47:31.550
Oh, my God.
Oh, no. No.

47:31.700 --> 47:33.276
- We had no idea.
- We didn't know.

47:33.300 --> 47:34.950
- We're new in town.
- We're very new.

47:35.020 --> 47:36.260
He was cute.

47:36.420 --> 47:37.581
He was fast.

47:37.660 --> 47:39.583
You should have seen him
in those last moments.

47:39.740 --> 47:41.788
I'm sorry. But listen,
you kidnapped us.

47:41.940 --> 47:44.227
And that's what motivated that.
So, like

47:44.380 --> 47:45.381
that is on you.

47:45.460 --> 47:46.791
Okay. What?
Wait a minute.

47:46.900 --> 47:48.550
She's really such a good kid.

47:48.620 --> 47:50.190
She is garbage.

47:50.340 --> 47:51.501
No.

47:51.660 --> 47:53.150
Yeah. Yes.

47:53.300 --> 47:54.904
Yes, I am.
Yes, you are.

47:55.060 --> 47:57.711
I am garbage.
I have never voted.

47:57.860 --> 48:00.306
I don't know any Spanish.
I only know one word.

48:00.460 --> 48:02.622
What they called me at my job
at the restaurant. Puta!

48:02.780 --> 48:03.996
Which I don't know
what it means.

48:04.020 --> 48:05.351
"Princess" or "pretty" or...

48:05.540 --> 48:07.030
It means "whore."

48:07.580 --> 48:08.786
That checks out.

48:08.940 --> 48:11.102
You took someone from my family.

48:12.700 --> 48:14.464
I must take someone from yours.

48:15.660 --> 48:18.982
That is the way it is.
I didn't make the rules.

48:19.180 --> 48:20.420
Not this one.

48:21.940 --> 48:22.941
Mom.

48:23.140 --> 48:24.824
Okay. Okay.

48:25.020 --> 48:26.863
Hold on. Look!

48:27.060 --> 48:28.300
<i>A spear gun.</i>

48:28.820 --> 48:29.901
I want you to take that,

48:29.980 --> 48:31.476
and I want you
to threaten him with it.

48:31.500 --> 48:32.596
Okay, I'm gonna distract them.

48:32.620 --> 48:33.621
Where are you going?

48:33.700 --> 48:34.861
I'm gonna distract them!

48:35.020 --> 48:36.146
You're distracting them?

48:45.780 --> 48:46.781
My son!

48:47.300 --> 48:49.667
MY son! My only son!

48:50.900 --> 48:51.901
What?

48:51.980 --> 48:53.505
Kill them!

48:54.060 --> 48:55.903
I told you to threaten him.

48:56.060 --> 48:57.141
That's his son?

48:57.260 --> 48:59.149
Someone order a boat
with a side of adventure?

48:59.220 --> 49:00.710
Shut the fuck up, Roger!

49:01.340 --> 49:04.583
MY son! My only son!

49:04.740 --> 49:06.026
- Go!
- Let's go!

49:06.180 --> 49:07.261
Manuel! Quickly, the boat!

49:07.420 --> 49:08.581
Come on, Mom!

49:14.460 --> 49:15.461
This is Morgan Russell.

49:15.740 --> 49:17.230
Yes! Morgan Russell!

49:17.380 --> 49:18.516
I'm the one that's been calling

49:18.540 --> 49:19.580
about the Middleton ladies

49:19.660 --> 49:21.469
and their situation
down in South America.

49:21.660 --> 49:22.956
Let's go get 'em.
What's the plan?

49:22.980 --> 49:25.301
Right, so, I told her
to contact me

49:25.380 --> 49:26.825
once she gets to Bogota.
Mmm-hmm.

49:26.900 --> 49:28.982
There's not much more I can
do, unfortunately, sir.

49:29.140 --> 49:33.350
Okay, I imagine that
you have some kind of

49:34.060 --> 49:35.186
commando squad.

49:35.380 --> 49:37.303
<i>Maybe, like, four
underground criminals</i>

49:37.460 --> 49:39.827
who were tried for a crime
they didn't commit.

49:39.980 --> 49:41.630
<i>And they've been living
in the underground</i>

49:41.780 --> 49:43.396
kinda helping people
along the way, almost

49:43.420 --> 49:44.660
Sir, were you born in the '70s?

49:44.740 --> 49:45.901
<i>Yeah.
Mmm.</i>

49:46.020 --> 49:47.636
That sounds like The A-Team.
It is The A-Team.

49:47.660 --> 49:49.264
Do you have an A-Team?

49:49.420 --> 49:52.026
We actually disbanded that
program in 1994, sir.

49:52.180 --> 49:53.261
Fuck! Shit!

49:53.340 --> 49:54.540
Okay, here's how you can help.

49:54.580 --> 49:55.956
<i>Pull out a pen
and a piece of paper.</i>

49:55.980 --> 49:56.981
Okay.

49:57.060 --> 49:59.188
<i>And write down, "If you feel
the urge to call again</i>

49:59.340 --> 50:00.751
"resist it."

50:00.900 --> 50:02.186
Wait. That's the advice?

50:02.260 --> 50:03.466
That's what you're giving me?

50:03.540 --> 50:04.587
Yep-

50:42.900 --> 50:45.107
I don't remember the
last time I had a drink.

50:47.020 --> 50:49.227
Mom, you need to relax.
All right?

50:49.380 --> 50:50.506
You're stressing me out.

50:50.580 --> 50:51.741
I can't relax.

50:51.900 --> 50:54.710
The most terrifying man
lever saw in my life

50:54.860 --> 50:55.861
was going to cut us up

50:55.940 --> 50:57.544
in little pieces
with his machete.

50:57.940 --> 51:01.262
And that was before
you murdered his son.

51:01.420 --> 51:03.229
Accidentally murdered.

51:03.380 --> 51:04.905
But, Mom.
What?

51:05.060 --> 51:07.427
Can we focus on the positive?
Because we are safe now.

51:07.580 --> 51:08.741
We're safe?

51:09.740 --> 51:11.549
You think we're safe?

51:11.700 --> 51:13.145
Yeah, we're safe.
We're on a boat.

51:13.300 --> 51:15.268
Look how fast they found us!

51:15.420 --> 51:17.309
I mean, I'm going to be
looking over my shoulder

51:17.420 --> 51:18.945
for the rest of my life.

51:19.100 --> 51:20.540
And then when I go
to sleep at night,

51:20.580 --> 51:21.786
I'm going to have an image

51:21.900 --> 51:25.700
of that spear going into
that man's throat. Ugh!

51:25.780 --> 51:27.430
Why would you
bring that up, Mom?

51:27.620 --> 51:28.701
Can't you just comfort me?

51:28.780 --> 51:30.589
Can you just please be my parent

51:30.660 --> 51:31.866
and make me feel better?

51:31.940 --> 51:33.076
Do you want me
to make you feel better?

51:33.100 --> 51:34.101
Yes.

51:34.220 --> 51:37.303
You are a very gifted murderer.

51:38.620 --> 51:39.621
Okay.

51:39.780 --> 51:40.941
You know, Mom,

51:41.060 --> 51:43.108
just because you can't
control this exact situation

51:43.260 --> 51:45.308
does not mean you have
to lash out at me.

51:45.460 --> 51:47.588
I can't stop my hands
from shaking, honey.

51:47.740 --> 51:49.396
Maybe you need to chill out
with the drinking,

51:49.420 --> 51:50.581
just a little bit, Mom.

51:51.140 --> 51:53.620
Look, Roger is gonna
get us home.

51:53.780 --> 51:55.020
Let's focus on that.

51:55.180 --> 51:56.784
Roger's going to get us home

51:56.980 --> 51:59.631
just like James was
taking you out on a date.

51:59.820 --> 52:00.821
Get it?

52:00.980 --> 52:02.027
Judgment.

52:02.460 --> 52:03.985
Linda, Emily.

52:04.460 --> 52:05.905
Luis, here, just got word

52:05.980 --> 52:07.550
that there's a boat
50 klicks back

52:07.660 --> 52:09.469
looking for two American women.

52:09.660 --> 52:11.071
Oh, God.
Oh, my God.

52:11.220 --> 52:13.063
Now, see? What'd I tell you?
Okay, okay.

52:13.140 --> 52:16.144
We have no choice but
to slip off now onto a canoe.

52:17.100 --> 52:19.580
I'll guide you through
the sack of the jaguar.

52:19.660 --> 52:21.230
Oh uh...

52:21.340 --> 52:22.501
You know, it's funny.

52:23.420 --> 52:24.660
I've been looking for adventure

52:24.740 --> 52:26.981
ever since I got to this
godforsaken land.

52:27.180 --> 52:29.501
And now, well, now

52:30.500 --> 52:33.026
it looks like
adventure's found me.

52:33.900 --> 52:35.629
Yeah.
Yeah, it has.

52:51.140 --> 52:52.869
Oh, I'm weak, honey.

52:53.700 --> 52:54.781
You should eat something.

52:54.860 --> 52:57.864
Hey, Roger.
Is this fruit okay?

52:58.980 --> 53:00.186
Sure.

53:00.380 --> 53:01.870
Okay.

53:01.980 --> 53:03.356
Oh, wait, do you mean, like,
is it poisonous?

53:03.380 --> 53:05.030
I don't know. Probably.

53:05.180 --> 53:06.625
Oh, my God!

53:06.780 --> 53:07.861
Ladies, listen to me.

53:07.980 --> 53:10.347
There's always a risk if you
want to feast on the sack.

53:10.500 --> 53:13.151
At some point, you're gonna
have to pick your poison.

53:13.300 --> 53:14.665
Starvation

53:14.820 --> 53:16.060
or poison.

53:16.140 --> 53:17.301
Mmm.

53:17.700 --> 53:19.350
Vatmonos.

53:21.860 --> 53:23.191
Oh!

53:25.140 --> 53:26.141
Ow!

53:28.220 --> 53:29.381
And, gosh, wasn't it weird

53:29.460 --> 53:31.340
how soggy the wood was
when I tried to light it?

53:31.380 --> 53:32.381
So weird.

53:32.460 --> 53:33.985
Linda, thanks for stepping up.

53:34.060 --> 53:35.141
You really did a great job.

53:35.220 --> 53:36.381
Yeah. It's awesome, Mom.

53:36.580 --> 53:37.741
Thanks, honey.

53:38.300 --> 53:40.428
Roger, why don't you
tell us a story?

53:40.580 --> 53:42.821
You've been an expedition
guide for forever, right?

53:43.220 --> 53:45.507
Expedition guide?
Oh, that's flattering.

53:45.580 --> 53:46.836
I haven't heard that one before.

53:46.860 --> 53:48.271
Yeah, my story.

53:49.260 --> 53:50.591
Uh, I've been here

53:51.540 --> 53:53.269
three long weeks now.

53:53.420 --> 53:55.104
First time on a plane.

53:55.580 --> 53:57.423
'Til recently, I was a GM
at a Trader Joe's

53:57.500 --> 53:58.740
up in Rochester.

53:58.820 --> 54:00.663
Although, one could say that

54:00.820 --> 54:02.185
the way that store was managed,

54:02.260 --> 54:03.341
that was the real jungle.

54:04.860 --> 54:07.101
And then, well,
my doctor said I was sick.

54:07.260 --> 54:09.581
So, I said to myself,
"Roger! What the heck?"

54:09.780 --> 54:11.066
"Go on down
to South America."

54:11.220 --> 54:12.585
Oh, God. Are you ill?

54:12.780 --> 54:15.067
Hmm? Yes, ma'am.
Caught the travel bug.

54:15.220 --> 54:16.551
Oh, the travel bug.

54:16.660 --> 54:17.946
I thought he was saying...

54:18.020 --> 54:19.021
And cancer.

54:19.620 --> 54:22.021
Doc gave me, oh,
a month to live,

54:22.100 --> 54:23.716
which gives me about
a week now, so, yeah.

54:23.740 --> 54:25.156
I mean, because you're
not just gonna

54:25.180 --> 54:27.023
walk on in to the Amazon

54:27.740 --> 54:29.947
if you're expecting
to walk on out.

54:30.100 --> 54:31.465
And so, yeah.

54:33.700 --> 54:35.384
No.
Sure.

54:35.540 --> 54:36.780
We got a big day tomorrow, huh?

54:36.860 --> 54:38.942
So I think we need to catch
a little shut-eye.

54:39.140 --> 54:40.744
Someone needs to stand watch.

54:40.900 --> 54:42.076
Why don't you guys
take the first shift?

54:42.100 --> 54:43.306
Wake me up in ten hours.

54:43.460 --> 54:45.064
Oh, boy!

54:45.220 --> 54:48.144
I don't know if I'll ever
even be able to get to sleep.

54:57.300 --> 54:58.984
God. Ugh!

54:59.100 --> 55:00.829
Why are we still following him?

55:00.940 --> 55:02.146
He's a cashier.

55:02.300 --> 55:03.904
He's a manager, Mom.

55:03.980 --> 55:05.220
Just stay positive.

55:05.300 --> 55:07.348
Feel free to drink
from any puddle you see.

55:07.500 --> 55:09.104
All water in the jungle is safe.

55:09.300 --> 55:11.826
You have no information.

55:16.260 --> 55:17.785
Wait.

55:22.740 --> 55:24.504
And just over this ridge

55:25.100 --> 55:26.784
that's the quickest way
to Bogota.

55:31.860 --> 55:34.261
We're going to swing over
to the other side.

55:36.300 --> 55:37.711
One at a time.

55:37.860 --> 55:39.021
<i>I'll go first</i>

55:39.180 --> 55:40.341
'cause I'm the man.

55:42.700 --> 55:44.031
Ha-ha!

55:54.500 --> 55:55.626
Oh!

55:58.020 --> 55:59.101
Fuck! Shit!

55:59.220 --> 56:00.301
Okay, Okay-

56:00.380 --> 56:02.303
Oh, my God!
This is bullshit!

56:02.380 --> 56:03.381
Okay.

56:03.500 --> 56:05.070
On, my God!

56:05.220 --> 56:06.381
Maybe he's okay.

56:06.500 --> 56:07.626
Okay, okay, okay-

56:07.700 --> 56:08.781
Okay.
Okay.

56:08.900 --> 56:10.140
O kay? O kay?
Okay. Okay.

56:10.220 --> 56:11.460
Okay.
Okay.

56:15.060 --> 56:16.061
Russell.

56:16.820 --> 56:18.151
Hello, Morgan.

56:19.580 --> 56:22.231
Sir, you've called
12 times today.

56:22.380 --> 56:23.506
<i>I've already told you.</i>

56:23.580 --> 56:25.662
<i>I've been in touch with
the US consulate in Bogota.</i>

56:25.740 --> 56:26.821
<i>They put out an alert</i>

56:26.900 --> 56:28.584
with the Colombian military
and police.

56:28.740 --> 56:30.540
All we can do is wait
until we hear from them.

56:30.980 --> 56:32.061
And I wonder what

56:33.260 --> 56:34.910
Joanne would think about this.

56:36.900 --> 56:38.584
Wait, did you say "Joanne"

56:38.740 --> 56:40.708
like, my wife, Joanne?

56:41.420 --> 56:42.751
Is this some kind of a threat?

56:42.820 --> 56:44.822
No, I didn't say Joanne.

56:44.900 --> 56:45.901
You said "Joanne."

56:46.020 --> 56:48.102
I said "Yo, Anne."
No, you <i>said</i> "Joanne"

56:48.180 --> 56:49.916
like you've been on my
Facebook page or something.

56:49.940 --> 56:50.980
<i>Let me tell you something.</i>

56:51.020 --> 56:52.863
<i>You called an officer
of the US government</i>

56:52.940 --> 56:54.510
and threatened his wife
over the phone.

56:54.580 --> 56:55.916
<i>I'm gonna tell you what's
gonna happen right now</i>

56:55.940 --> 56:57.942
<i>so I want you to get
real quiet, okay?</i>

56:58.060 --> 57:01.621
If you call this number one
more motherfucking time

57:01.780 --> 57:03.384
<i>I'm gonna show up at your house,</i>

57:03.580 --> 57:05.787
handcuff you
to the bumper of your car

57:05.940 --> 57:07.385
<i>and drag you to federal prison,</i>

57:07.500 --> 57:09.104
where you will be skull raped

57:09.180 --> 57:10.944
<i>to within an inch of your life,</i>

57:11.020 --> 57:12.749
<i>every single fucking night!</i>

57:12.820 --> 57:14.345
I don't think
you're gonna enjoy that.

57:14.420 --> 57:16.343
Oh, yeah?
I'll come to your house,

57:16.420 --> 57:17.910
and I'll fuck your dick.

57:21.500 --> 57:22.786
You know what? Hold up.

57:28.060 --> 57:29.949
Yo, yo, yo!

57:30.100 --> 57:32.196
"Yo, yo, yo"? That's racist, Jeffrey.
That's fucked up.

57:32.220 --> 57:33.221
"Yo, yo, yo"?

57:33.380 --> 57:35.826
Yo, this is This is Derrick.

57:35.980 --> 57:37.220
What's your last name, Derrick?

57:37.300 --> 57:38.301
Black.

57:39.340 --> 57:40.540
<i>Now let me tell you something.</i>

57:40.580 --> 57:42.423
That threat you made
is all fucked up.

57:42.500 --> 57:45.071

I got your address right here.

Roger said
it's just across the ridge.

58:30.620 --> 58:32.543
Roger is dead.

58:32.700 --> 58:33.781
I realize that.

58:33.860 --> 58:35.749
Yeah, and he didn't know
anything.

58:35.900 --> 58:37.425
Just use the map, Mom.

58:39.100 --> 58:40.147
On, my God.

58:40.340 --> 58:42.308
This is a placemat
from a restaurant.

58:42.460 --> 58:43.746
Everything will be fine.

58:43.900 --> 58:45.982
Everything is not fine,
Emily Louise.

58:46.180 --> 58:48.148
Look where we are.
Look where we are.

58:48.300 --> 58:50.587
In the middle of the Amazon!

58:51.820 --> 58:52.867
Oh, my God!

58:53.540 --> 58:55.747
That's how desperate I am
to spend time with you.

58:55.940 --> 58:57.351
I see you all the time.

58:58.420 --> 59:01.185
You see me when you
need something.

59:01.300 --> 59:02.347
That's not true.

59:02.420 --> 59:03.501
Yeah, and you know what?

59:03.580 --> 59:05.981
When I just say anything
just remotely critical...

59:06.060 --> 59:07.903
Wait!
"Remotely critical"?

59:08.700 --> 59:12.068
Mom, you flat-out insult me.
All the time.

59:12.140 --> 59:13.141
What?

59:13.220 --> 59:14.540
It's not a good way
to raise kids.

59:16.100 --> 59:18.307
What do you know
about raising kids?

59:18.460 --> 59:20.428
What do you know about anything?

59:20.580 --> 59:22.423
Except posting
pictures of yourself?

59:22.580 --> 59:25.311
Okay, well, I only post
so many pictures of myself

59:25.380 --> 59:27.860
because I want
people to witness me

59:27.940 --> 59:30.386
having an interesting, full life

59:30.540 --> 59:32.622
and give me compliments
in the comments.

59:32.780 --> 59:35.670
You can do that without
posting pictures. I do.

59:35.820 --> 59:37.584
You have a full,
interesting life?

59:37.740 --> 59:39.629
You just check the locks
all day.

59:39.820 --> 59:41.982
And change the kitty litter.

59:42.060 --> 59:44.825
You hide in your home
with your adult son.

59:46.180 --> 59:48.103
Are you saying that
I've wasted my life?

59:49.460 --> 59:50.461
I didn't say that.

59:50.580 --> 59:52.105
You know what?
You're wrong!

59:52.180 --> 59:56.105
Because I had you.
And I had your brother.

59:56.300 --> 59:58.587
So don't you dare say
I wasted my life.

59:58.660 --> 01:00:00.389
I gave you everything I had.

01:00:00.460 --> 01:00:01.746
Everything!

01:00:01.900 --> 01:00:03.823
And I did it alone!

01:00:05.700 --> 01:00:08.624
What the hell have you
ever done for anybody?

01:00:08.780 --> 01:00:10.589
For 18 years

01:00:10.740 --> 01:00:12.469
your mother is the most
important person

01:00:12.540 --> 01:00:13.871
to you in your entire life.

01:00:13.980 --> 01:00:15.584
And then...
And then...

01:00:15.740 --> 01:00:17.424
One day, poof!
You're gone.

01:00:17.580 --> 01:00:18.916
And then what are you
supposed to do?

01:00:18.940 --> 01:00:20.351
Like, just adjust?
Just like that?

01:00:21.220 --> 01:00:22.665
It's not possible, Emily.

01:00:23.540 --> 01:00:25.269
You were mine.

01:00:25.420 --> 01:00:27.149
And now, you're not.

01:00:28.260 --> 01:00:29.466
And I...

01:00:30.700 --> 01:00:31.826
I miss you.

01:00:31.980 --> 01:00:33.550
Mom, I'm right here.

01:00:34.700 --> 01:00:36.509
I'm the one who
invited you on this trip.

01:00:36.660 --> 01:00:38.310
I'm on this trip, Emily,

01:00:38.420 --> 01:00:41.390
because you didn't want
to drink Mai Tais alone.

01:00:41.540 --> 01:00:44.510
No! You are
the mergle fur!

01:00:44.660 --> 01:00:47.345
What the hell is mergle fur?

01:00:47.980 --> 01:00:48.981
Oh, Emily!

01:01:00.380 --> 01:01:02.348
On!

01:01:02.420 --> 01:01:03.706
Thank God!

01:01:03.900 --> 01:01:05.026
What's going on?

01:01:05.180 --> 01:01:07.945
Honey, we're so lucky
because I had to drag you

01:01:08.020 --> 01:01:10.182
all the way through
the jungle, looking for help.

01:01:10.340 --> 01:01:12.263
And I ran into Dr. Armando
and his friend.

01:01:12.420 --> 01:01:13.421
Now, this is Maco,

01:01:13.540 --> 01:01:14.676
who I've been teaching
a little English.

01:01:14.700 --> 01:01:15.940
No big deal.
Go ahead.

01:01:16.100 --> 01:01:17.511
Hello.
Ah!

01:01:17.580 --> 01:01:19.184
Good.
That's great.

01:01:19.340 --> 01:01:20.751
He's been assisting me

01:01:20.860 --> 01:01:22.749
as I search local plants
for a compound

01:01:22.900 --> 01:01:24.550
that could potentially...
Are you ready?

01:01:24.700 --> 01:01:25.701
Cure cancer.

01:01:25.860 --> 01:01:27.385
That is amazing!

01:01:27.540 --> 01:01:29.065
I think so.
Yes, thank you.

01:01:29.220 --> 01:01:30.500
All right.
Well, thank you, guys.

01:01:30.540 --> 01:01:31.716
- Thanks, Macho.
- You ready?

01:01:31.740 --> 01:01:33.310
Yeah, we're gonna
head out of here.

01:01:33.460 --> 01:01:34.905
Oh, you can't go just yet.

01:01:35.620 --> 01:01:37.384
Um, you have a parasite in you.

01:01:37.540 --> 01:01:39.224
What?
What's that?

01:01:39.380 --> 01:01:40.716
Here's the thing.
Your mother told us

01:01:40.740 --> 01:01:42.620
that you've been, like,
extremely hungry lately.

01:01:42.940 --> 01:01:44.590
And thankfully,
when you passed out

01:01:44.740 --> 01:01:46.230
you shat yourself.

01:01:46.380 --> 01:01:47.381
Thank God.

01:01:47.540 --> 01:01:48.780
Never seen so much shit.

01:01:51.060 --> 01:01:52.824
Like a human, almost.
Yeah.

01:01:52.980 --> 01:01:54.744
Okay, we understand.
It was a lot of shit.

01:01:54.900 --> 01:01:55.900
Lots of shit. Yes.

01:01:55.980 --> 01:01:56.981
I'm sorry.

01:01:57.140 --> 01:01:58.596
But through that, we could
take a stool sample

01:01:58.620 --> 01:01:59.621
and test it

01:01:59.740 --> 01:02:01.424
and determine that
you have a tapeworm.

01:02:01.580 --> 01:02:02.706
A tapeworm?

01:02:04.100 --> 01:02:05.226
Tapeworm.

01:02:05.420 --> 01:02:06.831
What?
Can I look at that?

01:02:06.980 --> 01:02:08.903
Yes, please. A second opinion is...
Yes.

01:02:09.060 --> 01:02:10.236
Please, please, please.
Go ahead.

01:02:10.260 --> 01:02:12.911
So what's the treatment?
Like a Z-pack?

01:02:13.420 --> 01:02:14.956
If it's already affecting
your appetite,

01:02:14.980 --> 01:02:16.584
I think it's probably...

01:02:17.860 --> 01:02:19.036
It's pretty significant.

01:02:19.060 --> 01:02:20.060
Oh!

01:02:20.100 --> 01:02:21.465
Listen.
We're out of praziquantel

01:02:21.580 --> 01:02:22.580
so we're going to have

01:02:22.620 --> 01:02:23.716
to substract it
from you manually.

01:02:23.740 --> 01:02:25.265
What? Manually? What?

01:02:25.420 --> 01:02:26.421
With my manuals.

01:02:26.580 --> 01:02:27.581
That's fuckin' gross.

01:02:27.780 --> 01:02:28.781
Good news! Right now,

01:02:28.900 --> 01:02:30.340
the tapeworm
is really hungry, right?

01:02:30.380 --> 01:02:31.586
So what we're gonna do

01:02:31.740 --> 01:02:33.742
is we're gonna lodge open
your throat

01:02:33.900 --> 01:02:36.267
and dangle a piece of meat
in front of your throat.

01:02:36.420 --> 01:02:37.626
Try to coax it out.

01:02:37.780 --> 01:02:38.916
It'll feel safe,
but it's not safe

01:02:38.940 --> 01:02:39.980
because I'm gonna pull it.

01:02:40.100 --> 01:02:41.147
No!
Slowly!

01:02:41.260 --> 01:02:43.103
Slowly! Slowly!
Then, slap it down.

01:02:43.260 --> 01:02:44.500
Slap it down. Kill it.

01:02:44.660 --> 01:02:45.991
You both have to pull it out?

01:02:46.140 --> 01:02:48.380
It's a two-man job, ma'am.
It's a two-man job, I'm sorry.

01:02:48.420 --> 01:02:50.468
I've got a worm, Mom.
I know.

01:02:50.620 --> 01:02:51.826
Mom!
I'm here.

01:02:51.980 --> 01:02:53.948
Get the worm out, Mom.
I'm your pillar.

01:02:54.140 --> 01:02:55.141
Hello.

01:03:03.540 --> 01:03:04.701
Oh, hello.

01:03:07.220 --> 01:03:09.905
When will we know
when it's working?

01:03:10.500 --> 01:03:12.548
When we look into
the worm's eyes, Linda.

01:03:13.420 --> 01:03:15.343
Come outside and face me.

01:03:15.500 --> 01:03:17.468
Yes. Show me your face.

01:03:18.740 --> 01:03:20.902
Oh, here it comes. Okay.

01:03:21.060 --> 01:03:22.061
Okay.

01:03:25.820 --> 01:03:26.820
Oh. What?

01:03:26.940 --> 01:03:28.380
Oh, it's coming.
It's making its way.

01:03:28.500 --> 01:03:29.700
Okay, relax, I got this. Move.

01:03:32.140 --> 01:03:34.461
Knock me out!
Knock me out!

01:03:42.660 --> 01:03:44.264
What are you doing?

01:03:44.420 --> 01:03:45.626
Okay! Okay!

01:03:51.140 --> 01:03:52.380
Help me. Help me!

01:04:02.860 --> 01:04:04.862
It's not like at home.

01:04:05.060 --> 01:04:07.461
I bet.
Oh, there she comes.

01:04:07.940 --> 01:04:08.941
Oh, look!

01:04:09.620 --> 01:04:10.985
Hi.
Hi.

01:04:12.180 --> 01:04:13.750
Baby.
Hi.

01:04:13.900 --> 01:04:15.220
Do you feel better?

01:04:15.660 --> 01:04:17.150
I feel great.

01:04:17.220 --> 01:04:18.551
- Oh, good.
- Yeah.

01:04:18.700 --> 01:04:19.701
You did good.

01:04:20.460 --> 01:04:22.428
Hi, Maco. Thank you.

01:04:23.700 --> 01:04:25.350
Emily, this is
a traditional gift

01:04:25.420 --> 01:04:26.556
that the village made for you.

01:04:26.580 --> 01:04:28.070
It's for protection
while you're here.

01:04:28.220 --> 01:04:29.710
For me?
Yes, for you.

01:04:29.900 --> 01:04:31.231
Oh, my God.

01:04:31.380 --> 01:04:33.382
That's so nice.

01:04:33.540 --> 01:04:35.065
It's heavy. It's thick.

01:04:35.220 --> 01:04:37.268
It's, like, hurting.
Thank you.

01:04:37.420 --> 01:04:38.421
It's tight.

01:04:40.380 --> 01:04:41.745
Something Kanye would design.

01:04:42.420 --> 01:04:43.660
That's great.

01:04:46.740 --> 01:04:49.471
Do they just kind of
do that all day?

01:04:49.620 --> 01:04:50.667
Oh, yes.

01:04:50.820 --> 01:04:52.743
When we got here,
we provided a lift.

01:04:52.900 --> 01:04:54.629
They used to have to walk
miles up the hill.

01:04:54.780 --> 01:04:55.906
But, much easier now.

01:04:56.060 --> 01:04:57.471
That's very thoughtful of you.

01:04:57.900 --> 01:04:59.186
And what do the men do?

01:04:59.260 --> 01:05:01.262
They just kind of straight
chill, or...

01:05:01.420 --> 01:05:03.787
Culturally,
the women do the work

01:05:03.940 --> 01:05:05.940
and the men, they provide
the protection, you know?

01:05:06.420 --> 01:05:07.751
Yeah.

01:05:08.460 --> 01:05:10.189
That's fucked up.

01:05:11.660 --> 01:05:13.788
Not for the men. Yeah.

01:05:17.780 --> 01:05:19.862
That's so cool. This is
what you guys are up to.

01:05:21.620 --> 01:05:23.702
Oh, I'm like in this now.
Okay.

01:05:25.420 --> 01:05:26.626
Ooh!

01:05:29.460 --> 01:05:32.509
Emily! The doctor said
he could get us to Bogota.

01:05:32.860 --> 01:05:34.191
That is amazing.

01:05:34.380 --> 01:05:35.461
Oh, my God!

01:05:35.620 --> 01:05:36.836
Okay. Do I have
a couple minutes?

01:05:36.860 --> 01:05:38.066
'Cause I'm kinda helping...

01:05:38.140 --> 01:05:39.869
Helping out the ladies.

01:05:44.620 --> 01:05:46.031
Thank you.

01:05:46.140 --> 01:05:48.142
Come here, you know
I got you, girl

01:05:50.380 --> 01:05:51.461
Look at you helping.

01:05:54.180 --> 01:05:56.581
Yeah, I am helpful.

01:05:56.660 --> 01:05:58.660
Honey, you know, when
I said that, I didn't mean...

01:05:58.700 --> 01:05:59.701
What?

01:05:59.820 --> 01:06:01.868
That I'm selfish
or that I'm worthless?

01:06:02.020 --> 01:06:03.146
Which part of our fight?

01:06:03.260 --> 01:06:04.989
Emily, come on.
I didn't mean that.

01:06:05.140 --> 01:06:07.541
It's fine.
I know how you see me.

01:06:11.300 --> 01:06:12.825
Yeah? Okay.

01:06:14.660 --> 01:06:15.661
Oh, God.

01:06:15.820 --> 01:06:17.300
Shit, shit, shit, shit.

01:06:18.820 --> 01:06:20.470
Shit, shit, shit!

01:06:21.380 --> 01:06:22.796
There's some very bad men
looking for you.

01:06:22.820 --> 01:06:23.820
They have guns.

01:06:23.860 --> 01:06:25.756
They've blocked the main
entrance. It's really bad.

01:06:25.780 --> 01:06:26.781
We're fucked!

01:06:26.860 --> 01:06:29.181
No, nobody's being fucked,
okay? I got an idea.

01:06:29.300 --> 01:06:30.825
I got an idea.
Go, I'll stall them.

01:06:31.020 --> 01:06:32.181
Go, go, go.
Yeah?

01:06:45.820 --> 01:06:47.310
Honey, get in here!

01:06:47.380 --> 01:06:49.189
This won't hold both of us.
I'm too heavy.

01:06:49.300 --> 01:06:51.701
No, you're perfect.

01:06:51.860 --> 01:06:53.271
You're just perfect.

01:06:53.620 --> 01:06:55.031
Okay, hold on tight.

01:06:55.180 --> 01:06:56.700
And, remember,
when you get down there,

01:06:56.740 --> 01:06:57.741
get to the embassy.

01:06:57.860 --> 01:06:59.749
No, Mom!
I want to stay with you!

01:06:59.860 --> 01:07:00.861
Mom!

01:07:01.020 --> 01:07:02.306
Mom!

01:07:02.420 --> 01:07:03.660
Everything's gonna be okay.

01:07:05.540 --> 01:07:07.065
I love you!

01:07:22.620 --> 01:07:23.746
Oh.

01:07:56.860 --> 01:07:58.385
Hello.

01:07:58.540 --> 01:07:59.871
Emily.

01:08:00.340 --> 01:08:01.705
Hi.
Hi.

01:08:02.100 --> 01:08:05.183
We were able to get your items
sent over from the hotel.

01:08:05.260 --> 01:08:06.421
Any updates on my mom?

01:08:06.580 --> 01:08:08.184
Oh, I'm sorry.
There's nothing yet.

01:08:08.340 --> 01:08:10.547
But we are gonna get you

01:08:10.620 --> 01:08:12.031
an escort
to the airfield base...

01:08:12.180 --> 01:08:14.023
And then someone will
get you home from there.

01:08:14.460 --> 01:08:15.791
I'm not doing that.

01:08:16.420 --> 01:08:18.946
I'm not going anywhere
without my mother.

01:08:19.100 --> 01:08:20.430
Can I be candid with you?

01:08:20.580 --> 01:08:21.627
Yeah. What?

01:08:21.779 --> 01:08:23.430
It's my third day.

01:08:23.580 --> 01:08:26.106
And I guess everybody
takes off on Fridays,

01:08:26.260 --> 01:08:27.261
but they didn't tell me

01:08:27.420 --> 01:08:29.149
because it's my third day.

01:08:30.140 --> 01:08:32.950
So if you could just
take your box and go.

01:08:33.140 --> 01:08:34.435
I don't know
what you're talking about.

01:08:34.460 --> 01:08:35.660
I just need to find my mother.

01:08:35.779 --> 01:08:37.225
That's why I'm here.

01:08:37.380 --> 01:08:39.462
The only reason my mother
even came on this trip

01:08:39.620 --> 01:08:42.145
is because I made her.
Because I am selfish.

01:08:42.300 --> 01:08:44.381
And I need help
finding her right now,

01:08:44.460 --> 01:08:46.383
and I need you to be the guy
that helps me.

01:08:46.819 --> 01:08:49.140
Come on, man.
Be that guy.

01:08:49.300 --> 01:08:50.381
Who's the guy?

01:08:50.580 --> 01:08:51.661
Not me!

01:08:51.819 --> 01:08:53.310
It isn't.
It's never been.

01:08:53.460 --> 01:08:55.827
I'd love to be the guy who
sweeps you off your feet

01:08:55.939 --> 01:08:57.828
and is your hero
and can save your mother

01:08:57.939 --> 01:08:59.580
and take care of you
and maybe we hook up.

01:08:59.620 --> 01:09:01.109
I don't know.
Wait, what?

01:09:01.260 --> 01:09:04.264
But I'm just saying
that I am not that dude.

01:09:04.420 --> 01:09:06.991
So I need you to be that girl

01:09:07.180 --> 01:09:10.184
who just takes your box
and walks outta this office

01:09:10.340 --> 01:09:12.104
before you draw
any more attention

01:09:12.180 --> 01:09:13.916
to the fact that I don't
know what I'm doing.

01:09:13.939 --> 01:09:15.510
Can I just use your phone?

01:09:15.660 --> 01:09:18.027
Can you be the guy
that lets me use his phone?

01:09:18.180 --> 01:09:20.865
Yes. See? That I can do.

01:09:21.020 --> 01:09:22.020
Come on.

01:09:29.020 --> 01:09:30.276
I haven't been trained
on the phone system.

01:09:30.300 --> 01:09:31.631
Oh, my God!

01:09:39.340 --> 01:09:40.386
Hello, Morgan.

01:09:40.779 --> 01:09:41.781
Hell, no.

01:09:41.939 --> 01:09:43.544
Choose your next move
carefully, brother.

01:09:45.540 --> 01:09:46.951
Wait! No, no, no!

01:09:47.100 --> 01:09:48.305
Don't touch me.
Security!

01:09:48.380 --> 01:09:49.541
Purell! Put on Purell!

01:09:49.660 --> 01:09:50.786
I fucking hate germs.

01:09:50.859 --> 01:09:54.069
Fucking shit! Let me
have my day in court.

01:09:54.220 --> 01:09:56.302
All right, wait, wait, wait!

01:09:56.460 --> 01:10:00.146
Morgan, I'm a middle-aged man
who never leaves the house.

01:10:00.300 --> 01:10:03.224
All I have in this world
is my mama and my sister.

01:10:03.380 --> 01:10:05.144
And if something happens to them

01:10:05.300 --> 01:10:06.904
then all I'll have is you.

01:10:07.660 --> 01:10:09.071
And I'm telling you right now

01:10:10.060 --> 01:10:11.505
I'm fucking annoying.

01:10:12.060 --> 01:10:14.347
I've read all
the Game of Thrones books.

01:10:14.500 --> 01:10:15.740
I'll text you spoilers.

01:10:15.900 --> 01:10:16.981
Please.

01:10:17.140 --> 01:10:18.876
I don't
want to go to an orphanage.

01:10:18.900 --> 01:10:20.061
I can't be an orphan.

01:10:20.620 --> 01:10:22.224
I need my mama!

01:10:22.420 --> 01:10:24.661
Help me find my mama!

01:10:24.740 --> 01:10:25.876
Thank you so much for answering.

01:10:25.900 --> 01:10:26.996
I didn't know who else to call.

01:10:27.020 --> 01:10:28.020
<i>I'm all alone.</i>

01:10:28.060 --> 01:10:29.716
The guy I dealt with
at the embassy was insane.

01:10:29.740 --> 01:10:31.947
Emily, we're gonna
get you through this.

01:10:32.140 --> 01:10:34.461
<i>But Barb wants me
to let you know one thing.</i>

01:10:34.620 --> 01:10:37.464
She refuses to use
sexual humiliation

01:10:37.580 --> 01:10:39.309
as an interrogation technique.

01:10:39.460 --> 01:10:40.586
What are you talking about?

01:10:40.740 --> 01:10:41.821
Fine! She'll use it.

01:10:41.940 --> 01:10:44.261
I don't care what she does.
Just can you help me?

01:10:44.420 --> 01:10:45.990
<i>Meet us at
the Presidente Apartments</i>

01:10:46.100 --> 01:10:47.101
at 19 hours.

01:10:47.260 --> 01:10:48.436
We're trying to use
her cell signal

01:10:48.460 --> 01:10:49.746
to narrow down their location.

01:10:49.900 --> 01:10:51.756
Colombian military is setting
up a couple stingrays

01:10:51.780 --> 01:10:52.781
in the region now.

01:10:52.900 --> 01:10:54.396
We can have a unit ready
to go in by tomorrow.

01:10:54.420 --> 01:10:55.785
Well, we got a big problem

01:10:55.940 --> 01:10:57.596
'cause that unit needed
to be there yesterday.

01:10:57.620 --> 01:11:00.271
I told you to shut the fuck up!

01:11:00.460 --> 01:11:01.461
Okay.

01:11:02.260 --> 01:11:03.261
Go ahead, solider.

01:11:03.420 --> 01:11:05.076
We've got reports
coming in that puts them

01:11:05.100 --> 01:11:06.465
about 50 miles
outside of Bogota.

01:11:06.620 --> 01:11:08.588
Yeah, that's
Morgado territory all right.

01:11:08.660 --> 01:11:10.901
Who's Morgado?

01:11:10.980 --> 01:11:12.636
Let's just say he's none
of your goddamn business.

01:11:12.660 --> 01:11:13.940
- Let me come with you.
- No!

01:11:13.980 --> 01:11:15.470
Please!
Absolutely not!

01:11:15.620 --> 01:11:17.304
I'll translate.
You speak Spanish?

01:11:17.460 --> 01:11:18.541
I speak Dothraki.

01:11:18.620 --> 01:11:19.667
I speak Klingon.

01:11:19.820 --> 01:11:20.821
You speak Klingon?

01:11:23.500 --> 01:11:24.501
Nope.

01:11:24.620 --> 01:11:25.956
Know what that means?
It doesn't mean anything.

01:11:25.980 --> 01:11:27.636
I'm coming with.
You're not going anywhere.

01:11:27.660 --> 01:11:29.628
I think I see them right there.
Is that them?

01:11:29.780 --> 01:11:30.827
Little specks there?

01:11:30.940 --> 01:11:31.987
Zoom in. Enhance.

01:11:32.100 --> 01:11:33.116
You know, why don't
you wait outside.

01:11:33.140 --> 01:11:34.141
Go, go in the hallway.

01:11:34.300 --> 01:11:35.301
Fuck!

01:11:35.460 --> 01:11:36.791
Nerd. He's a nerd.

01:11:37.700 --> 01:11:38.826
So what's the plan?

01:11:38.980 --> 01:11:42.507
We have someone here I think
you're gonna want to see.

01:11:44.780 --> 01:11:45.781
James?

01:11:46.300 --> 01:11:47.476
- Oh, my God.
- What's going on?

01:11:47.500 --> 01:11:49.596
Thank fuck. Emily. Listen,
you've gotta help me, please.

01:11:49.620 --> 01:11:51.145
We found him sitting at the bar,

01:11:51.300 --> 01:11:53.348
chatting up another
pretty young girl.

01:11:53.500 --> 01:11:54.786
It's a scam, Emily.

01:11:54.940 --> 01:11:57.511
Yeah, so Barb waited
for him outside

01:11:57.660 --> 01:12:00.266
smacked him in the back of the
head, threw him in the car

01:12:00.340 --> 01:12:01.705
and here we are.

01:12:01.860 --> 01:12:03.430
It's not a scam.
These women are crazy.

01:12:03.500 --> 01:12:05.150
This whole fucking thing
is insane.

01:12:05.340 --> 01:12:06.341
Crazy?

01:12:06.460 --> 01:12:08.303
Oh, you wanna know crazy?

01:12:08.380 --> 01:12:11.065
You remember
my platonic friend, Barb?

01:12:11.220 --> 01:12:12.870
Oh, Barb!

01:12:15.660 --> 01:12:18.345
We were supposed to go
to the Arizona Gem Show

01:12:18.500 --> 01:12:21.344
but instead, I'm here,
fucking with you.

01:12:23.180 --> 01:12:28.391
You should know that Barb
spent her life in special ops.

01:12:28.540 --> 01:12:30.383
Not that bullshit regular ops.

01:12:30.540 --> 01:12:31.871
She's retired now

01:12:32.020 --> 01:12:33.863
so she doesn't have her toolkit.

01:12:34.020 --> 01:12:36.227
But she was able to
improvise a few things.

01:12:36.380 --> 01:12:38.189
Which, I'm pretty sure,

01:12:38.260 --> 01:12:40.740
will all be applied
to your dick hole area.

01:12:42.700 --> 01:12:44.225
Esmeraldas!
She's in Esmeraldas.

01:12:45.340 --> 01:12:46.820
It's, like,
an hour's drive from here.

01:12:46.940 --> 01:12:48.271
We got a real Chatty Cathy here.

01:12:48.420 --> 01:12:50.116
Give me a map. I can mark it
on the map for you.

01:12:50.140 --> 01:12:51.221
Write it down.

01:12:51.300 --> 01:12:52.301
You want to start here...

01:12:53.420 --> 01:12:55.388
Barb is really upset
about this. She had plans.

01:12:56.820 --> 01:12:58.470
Now this doesn't always
show up on Waze

01:12:59.660 --> 01:13:01.105
but you be sure to take that one

01:13:01.220 --> 01:13:02.585
because it's the quickest route

01:13:02.660 --> 01:13:03.796
if you want to avoid traffic.

01:13:03.820 --> 01:13:04.901
Okay.

01:13:05.420 --> 01:13:07.229
Okay, let's go.
Listen, Emily.

01:13:07.420 --> 01:13:08.945
Be sure you check all the rooms.

01:13:09.060 --> 01:13:10.716
She'll probably be held
on the third floor.

01:13:10.740 --> 01:13:11.946
One of the rooms in the back.

01:13:12.100 --> 01:13:15.104
Do you have any loyalty
to the people who hired you?

01:13:15.780 --> 01:13:17.748
Hey, Emily, can I just
say, <i>as</i> well, you...

01:13:18.420 --> 01:13:19.785
Fuck, you look great.

01:13:20.620 --> 01:13:22.190
Thank you.
I got a tapeworm.

01:13:22.340 --> 01:13:23.626
Well, it's working for you.

01:13:23.780 --> 01:13:25.111
Hey, listen!
Are we, uh...

01:13:25.580 --> 01:13:27.264
Am I ever going to
see you again?

01:13:27.420 --> 01:13:28.467
Well, I don't know.

01:13:28.580 --> 01:13:30.020
I guess if you're, like,
in New York,

01:13:30.100 --> 01:13:31.101
we could get a drink.

01:13:33.100 --> 01:13:35.421
In your wet dreams,
motherfucker.

01:13:44.260 --> 01:13:46.308
<i>♪ I had this bad bitch Uptown,
she was whoa!</i>

01:13:46.420 --> 01:13:49.026
<i>♪ Had me fucked up in the head
I mean, whoa!</i>

01:13:49.100 --> 01:13:51.180
<i>♪ Bought the bitch diamonds
And pearls, I mean, whoa!</i>

01:13:51.660 --> 01:13:54.709
<i>♪ Shoulda seen them shits
shinnin' on her wrist, whoa ♪</i>

01:13:55.020 --> 01:13:56.510
Be super quiet.

01:13:57.100 --> 01:13:59.036
<i>You have
arrived at your destination.</i>

01:13:59.060 --> 01:14:00.186
Fix it!

01:14:03.620 --> 01:14:04.701
Let's go get your mom.

01:14:37.460 --> 01:14:38.871
Just walk.
Huh?

01:14:45.820 --> 01:14:47.629
OW!

01:14:56.620 --> 01:14:57.621
Shh! Okay.

01:14:57.700 --> 01:14:59.036
We're all gonna jump down there,

01:14:59.060 --> 01:15:00.061
sneak past those guys

01:15:00.140 --> 01:15:01.141
and get your mom.

01:15:01.220 --> 01:15:02.221
Okay.

01:15:59.500 --> 01:16:00.501
Fuck, fuck, fuck

01:16:30.660 --> 01:16:31.741
Oh, honey!

01:16:31.900 --> 01:16:33.425
I made a shiv.

01:16:34.700 --> 01:16:36.111
You're alive.

01:16:36.260 --> 01:16:37.546
Oh, my God, Mom.

01:16:37.620 --> 01:16:39.180
I'm so sorry
I got you into all of this.

01:16:40.860 --> 01:16:41.916
I should have just
listened to you.

01:16:41.940 --> 01:16:42.996
I should have listened to you.

01:16:43.020 --> 01:16:44.021
That's okay.

01:16:44.100 --> 01:16:47.786
You're always there.
If I'm sad or lonely.

01:16:47.940 --> 01:16:50.386
And it's 3:00 in the
morning, I call

01:16:50.540 --> 01:16:52.463
and you answer.

01:16:52.620 --> 01:16:54.110
You always answer.

01:16:54.260 --> 01:16:55.785
I know, I know.

01:16:55.980 --> 01:16:57.550
You're that person for me, Mom.

01:16:57.700 --> 01:16:59.350
Okay, honey.

01:16:59.460 --> 01:17:00.905
I'm so sorry.

01:17:01.660 --> 01:17:04.391
I love you.

01:17:04.460 --> 01:17:07.350
Honey, this is
a really long hug.

01:17:07.500 --> 01:17:09.468
Can we have just
one more second?

01:17:09.540 --> 01:17:11.030
I really thought you were dead.

01:17:11.140 --> 01:17:12.062
This is great,

01:17:12.140 --> 01:17:13.676
but we really got to get
the fuck out of here.

01:17:13.700 --> 01:17:14.701
Okay, Okay-

01:17:24.900 --> 01:17:26.265
Okay, okay.

01:17:39.660 --> 01:17:40.661
Okay.

01:17:42.860 --> 01:17:43.941
The car's over here.

01:17:44.700 --> 01:17:46.220
- Oh, my God.
- Are you okay?

01:17:46.540 --> 01:17:47.541
No.

01:17:51.500 --> 01:17:52.626
Oh, my God!

01:17:53.180 --> 01:17:54.180
Put up the window.

01:17:54.220 --> 01:17:56.382
Do you have some cyanide
we could take, or something?

01:17:56.540 --> 01:17:57.951
Oh, my God!
Hurry up! Hurry up!

01:17:58.700 --> 01:18:00.190
Oh, my God!

01:18:00.740 --> 01:18:01.901
Oh, my God.

01:18:03.380 --> 01:18:05.701
It doesn't hurt too much,
but roll it down.

01:18:05.860 --> 01:18:06.860
No.

01:18:06.900 --> 01:18:08.390
Roll it down, pendeja.
No!

01:18:08.460 --> 01:18:09.507
Push the fucking button.

01:18:09.580 --> 01:18:11.389
I can't, pendeja.
It's broken.

01:18:11.460 --> 01:18:12.507
It's broken?

01:18:12.620 --> 01:18:13.621
Yeah, sorry. Goodbye.

01:18:18.580 --> 01:18:19.661
Hi!

01:18:19.740 --> 01:18:20.787
No! No! No!

01:18:20.940 --> 01:18:22.590
No! No!

01:18:22.700 --> 01:18:23.701
No!

01:18:28.620 --> 01:18:29.620
No!

01:18:29.780 --> 01:18:31.748
Now, I'm gonna kill you.

01:18:31.900 --> 01:18:33.629
Don't touch my daughter!

01:18:41.300 --> 01:18:42.301
Don't move!

01:18:45.980 --> 01:18:46.980
Now what?

01:18:47.060 --> 01:18:48.630
Do you wanna dance?

01:18:53.580 --> 01:18:54.581
Yes!

01:18:54.740 --> 01:18:56.424
Nice kick, malparida.

01:18:56.580 --> 01:18:57.911
Nice kick.

01:18:58.100 --> 01:18:59.101
Now

01:18:59.900 --> 01:19:02.790
let me show you my dance.

01:19:03.140 --> 01:19:04.141
Oh, my God.

01:19:19.180 --> 01:19:20.784
Ugh! Okay.

01:19:20.940 --> 01:19:23.102
I beg you.
Don't shoot me.

01:19:23.260 --> 01:19:25.183
You fucked with
the wrong bitches.

01:19:25.380 --> 01:19:26.461
Yeah, you did.

01:19:27.540 --> 01:19:29.349
Kill him, Mom.
No. I can't.

01:19:29.500 --> 01:19:30.626
This is a mom thing.

01:19:30.780 --> 01:19:32.276
No, this isn't a mom thing.
You got this.

01:19:32.300 --> 01:19:33.996
- It's not what I do well.
- I don't do it well.

01:19:34.020 --> 01:19:35.306
You did it before.

01:19:35.420 --> 01:19:36.626
Those were accidental.

01:19:36.780 --> 01:19:38.270
I can't hold it anymore.

01:19:38.340 --> 01:19:39.944
Okay, here I go.
Go!

01:19:40.140 --> 01:19:41.436
I'm gonna count down,
I'm gonna do it.

01:19:41.460 --> 01:19:42.460
Please. Please.

01:19:42.500 --> 01:19:43.547
100...

01:19:44.380 --> 01:19:45.745
99...

01:19:53.140 --> 01:19:54.141
Oh, fuck!

01:19:54.700 --> 01:19:55.701
Oh, thank God!

01:19:55.820 --> 01:19:56.821
Come on. Kill me.

01:19:56.940 --> 01:19:58.076
Now I'm getting the confidence.

01:19:58.100 --> 01:19:59.306
Give me that thing.
Oh, okay.

01:19:59.420 --> 01:20:01.229
No, I can't do that.
I just got excited.

01:20:01.300 --> 01:20:02.506
Don't move!

01:20:09.980 --> 01:20:11.345
I will kill you.

01:20:12.140 --> 01:20:14.666
Very rude!
Very rude!

01:20:21.180 --> 01:20:23.865
Here we go.
Moving in hot.

01:20:24.060 --> 01:20:25.983
This is what we trained for.
You, on the roof.

01:20:26.140 --> 01:20:27.141
You, on the roof.

01:20:27.660 --> 01:20:29.662
You, also on the roof.
Everyone on the roof.

01:20:30.620 --> 01:20:31.621
I know you're scared...

01:20:31.820 --> 01:20:34.551
Again, shut the fuck up, man!

01:20:34.740 --> 01:20:36.344
Okay?
Okay,

01:20:36.500 --> 01:20:37.865
Jeffrey.
What?

01:20:38.020 --> 01:20:39.067
Jeffrey!

01:20:39.860 --> 01:20:40.861
Mama...

01:20:41.860 --> 01:20:43.862
Mama! Mama!

01:20:44.860 --> 01:20:46.066
Mama!

01:20:46.180 --> 01:20:47.705
Mama!

01:20:59.060 --> 01:21:00.391
I missed you.

01:21:00.540 --> 01:21:03.544
Oh, my God!
I'm so happy to see you.

01:21:03.700 --> 01:21:04.861
I left the house.

01:21:05.020 --> 01:21:06.146
You left the house.

01:21:06.220 --> 01:21:07.665
I made all these men come...

01:21:07.820 --> 01:21:08.981
What?
Oh!

01:21:09.060 --> 01:21:11.267
Here! I made them come here
to get you.

01:21:12.580 --> 01:21:14.230
I missed you!
I missed you, too!

01:21:14.380 --> 01:21:16.508
Hey. Agent Russell.

01:21:16.700 --> 01:21:17.986
Let me take that from you.

01:21:18.060 --> 01:21:19.346
Good job with Morgado.

01:21:19.500 --> 01:21:21.020
We've been looking for him
for a while.

01:21:21.060 --> 01:21:22.869
Oh, my God.
He's so mean.

01:21:23.020 --> 01:21:25.022
Anyway, your brother
really cares about you.

01:21:25.540 --> 01:21:26.905
Mama!

01:21:27.260 --> 01:21:28.591
He's a real bummer.

01:21:28.740 --> 01:21:30.185
Oh, yeah. The worst.

01:21:30.260 --> 01:21:32.069
Yep. Awful.
Full agreement.

01:21:32.220 --> 01:21:34.063
Morgan. Morgan!

01:21:34.220 --> 01:21:35.301
What?

01:21:37.300 --> 01:21:38.301
Thank you.

01:21:43.940 --> 01:21:45.101
You're the best!

01:21:45.260 --> 01:21:47.581
You're the best!
Thank you for your help.

01:21:50.420 --> 01:21:52.263
I wanna go home so fucking bad.

01:21:52.380 --> 01:21:53.745
I'm so hungry.
I'm so hungry.

01:22:13.900 --> 01:22:15.743
Let's get the fuck out of here!

01:22:38.780 --> 01:22:40.987
Can I have just whatever
everyone is drinking?

01:22:41.140 --> 01:22:42.316
Just, like,
your signature thing.

01:22:42.340 --> 01:22:43.341
Yeah.

01:22:47.660 --> 01:22:48.821
Hi.

01:22:49.540 --> 01:22:50.871
<i>HEY-</i>

01:22:51.020 --> 01:22:52.670
What brings you down here?

01:22:53.180 --> 01:22:54.261
Oh, uh...

01:22:54.380 --> 01:22:55.791
I'm actually volunteering.

01:22:55.940 --> 01:22:56.987
That's awesome.

01:22:57.140 --> 01:22:58.710
Yeah, it's really fun.

01:22:58.860 --> 01:23:00.021
Can I get you a drink?

01:23:00.700 --> 01:23:02.111
Uh...

01:23:02.660 --> 01:23:04.230
I'm kind of here with somebody.

01:23:04.340 --> 01:23:05.387
Oh.

01:23:05.500 --> 01:23:06.661
Honey!
Hi, Mom!

01:23:06.820 --> 01:23:08.151
Oh, God, this is so fun!

01:23:08.300 --> 01:23:09.381
Isn't it?
I know.

01:23:09.540 --> 01:23:12.191
Okay, so anyway, I met this
fascinating woman over there.

01:23:12.340 --> 01:23:13.830
And she's gonna take us
to her home

01:23:14.020 --> 01:23:15.820
and she's gonna teach us
how to make murtabak.

01:23:15.900 --> 01:23:17.709
What is that?
It's a stuffed pancake.

01:23:17.900 --> 01:23:18.901
Awesome!

01:23:19.060 --> 01:23:21.100
I'm gonna go make a request
because I want to dance.

01:23:21.140 --> 01:23:22.187
Oh, I love you.

01:23:22.300 --> 01:23:23.347
I love you.

01:23:26.060 --> 01:23:27.471
You're here with your mother.

01:23:27.660 --> 01:23:29.230
Yeah.

01:23:29.980 --> 01:23:31.186
Why?

01:23:31.980 --> 01:23:33.141
Um...

01:23:40.900 --> 01:23:42.902
She's fucking awesome.

01:23:44.340 --> 01:23:45.671
That's really sweet.

01:23:47.020 --> 01:23:48.226
Her tit is out.

01:23:48.380 --> 01:23:49.381
Wait, what?

01:23:49.540 --> 01:23:51.065
