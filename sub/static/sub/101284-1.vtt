02:43.496 --> 02:45.915
Hey, Theo. It's so dark in here.

02:48.918 --> 02:51.338
- You doin' some magic?
- No.

02:51.421 --> 02:53.673
Yeah, I haven't seen you
do any tricks in a while.

02:54.299 --> 02:56.926
Well, guess I'll forget about
what came in the mail for you.

02:57.010 --> 02:58.595
What came in the mail for me?

02:58.678 --> 03:02.390
You've been invited to attend this place...
The Institute of Magic.

03:02.849 --> 03:05.894
It's up in the mountains.
It's a five-week intensive study where...

03:05.977 --> 03:08.355
I know what the Institute of Magic is.

03:08.438 --> 03:10.857
Dad and I used to talk about it
all the time.

03:20.700 --> 03:23.870
There's a voice inside of you,
and it's the voice that says,

03:23.953 --> 03:26.790
"I want to be a magician."

03:27.374 --> 03:28.375
Hello, Theo.

03:28.458 --> 03:29.876
How did he know my name?

03:29.959 --> 03:33.004
How did I know your name?
It was on your application.

03:33.088 --> 03:38.510
Theo, I'm national treasure Roy Preston,
and I hear voices too.

03:38.593 --> 03:42.722
Shribbity-three-ish years ago,
I founded the Institute of Magic,

03:42.806 --> 03:45.642
a conservatory
for promising young magicians.

03:45.725 --> 03:50.313
Here, world-famous magicians
will teach you the seven types of magic.

03:50.730 --> 03:51.940
Sleight of hand.

03:55.360 --> 03:56.361
Prediction.

04:00.031 --> 04:01.032
Restoration.

04:01.116 --> 04:04.994
Vanish... and appearance.

04:05.078 --> 04:07.497
Solid... through solid.

04:09.708 --> 04:10.709
Escape.

04:12.252 --> 04:13.545
Levitation.

04:13.628 --> 04:15.588
And you will get to perform

04:15.672 --> 04:19.259
in the world-famous
Roy Preston Prememorial Theater.

04:19.341 --> 04:23.221
And you'll build lasting relationships
with other young magicians.

04:23.304 --> 04:27.267
Even the weird ones.
Because here, we're all the weird ones.

04:29.102 --> 04:31.521
Wow. Cool bird, Randall.

04:31.604 --> 04:34.858
But don't take my word for it.
Come see for yourself this summer.

04:39.487 --> 04:41.364
Magic camp sounds pretty cool?

04:41.448 --> 04:44.492
It's not "magic camp."
It's the Institute of Magic.

04:44.576 --> 04:46.286
It's totally famous.

04:46.369 --> 04:48.621
But I don't know.

04:50.206 --> 04:51.875
I should stay home this summer.

04:52.959 --> 04:57.297
You need me to mow the lawn
and to entertain Cameron.

04:57.380 --> 05:00.008
I'm fine.
And you're not that entertaining.

05:01.051 --> 05:05.388
I thought you might be interested in this,
but if you're not, that's okay.

05:06.181 --> 05:07.599
Wait.

05:08.975 --> 05:11.144
Dad always said he wanted me to go there.

05:11.853 --> 05:15.732
He must have applied for me
before... you know.

05:16.900 --> 05:20.612
If Dad took the time to apply for me,
I should probably...

05:20.695 --> 05:23.114
You could spend the summer
mowing the lawn,

05:23.907 --> 05:27.327
or you can study magic
with the world's greatest magicians.

05:33.958 --> 05:36.378
- Do you have the tickets?
- Honey.

05:36.461 --> 05:38.713
- No, I don't have the tickets.
- You have the tickets!

05:40.382 --> 05:43.885
"This generation's greatest magician."
Yeah, right.

05:43.968 --> 05:45.929
We're seeing Penn and Teller at the Rio.

05:46.012 --> 05:47.097
Great.

05:47.180 --> 05:51.393
- Last night we saw Kris Darkwood.
- Minds blown.

05:51.476 --> 05:54.521
And then Darkwood made the David statue
at Caesars totally disappear.

05:54.604 --> 05:55.980
My head is still exploding.

05:56.690 --> 06:01.027
Kristina Darkwood
has the most mind-blowing show in Vegas.

06:01.111 --> 06:03.822
It's not mind-blowing.
Your head will not explode, I promise you.

06:07.617 --> 06:10.745
Geez. What do you got in this thing?

06:11.413 --> 06:12.872
Soup!

06:12.956 --> 06:16.960
I'm so sorry.
I swear I had a 20-dollar bill in here.

06:17.919 --> 06:22.382
Where did it go? Maybe it's in here.
I'll look for it.

06:22.465 --> 06:25.010
My. No, it's not here.

06:25.093 --> 06:27.721
Here it is.

06:27.804 --> 06:30.807
- Found it.
! Thank heavens.

06:31.850 --> 06:34.269
Can I have $12 back?

06:39.357 --> 06:41.276
Last time I try to be a nice guy.

06:41.359 --> 06:43.319
"Nice" may be an overstatement.

06:44.904 --> 06:48.199
Roy. Hey. What are you doing here?

06:48.908 --> 06:49.909
Vegas, baby.

06:50.410 --> 06:53.872
Also, can you take me
to 123 Hope Street, please?

06:56.875 --> 06:58.084
So, Andy, how's business?

06:58.168 --> 07:00.337
Living the dream.

07:00.420 --> 07:03.631
I just learned this awesome new trick
called "Uber cuts my paychecks in half."

07:04.799 --> 07:09.095
Well, you are in luck because I have
a counselor opening this summer.

07:09.179 --> 07:12.265
David Blaine dropped out,
and you were the first name I thought of.

07:12.349 --> 07:13.350
- Really?
- Yeah.

07:13.433 --> 07:16.353
David Blaine drops out,
and I'm the second name on the list.

07:16.436 --> 07:18.646
I never said you were
the second name on the list.

07:18.730 --> 07:20.857
I said you were the first person
I thought of.

07:20.940 --> 07:22.525
You were...

07:22.609 --> 07:24.694
You were
pretty far down there on the list.

07:24.778 --> 07:28.365
Well, I appreciate your blunt honesty,
but I don't do magic anymore.

07:28.448 --> 07:30.784
I haven't for a long time.
Ever since Darkwood...

07:30.867 --> 07:34.496
Yes.
I'm so sorry and I-I don't blame you.

07:35.330 --> 07:36.664
- Really?
- No.

07:36.748 --> 07:39.876
You cannot love magic
with your whole heart

07:39.959 --> 07:41.961
until your heart is whole again.

07:42.045 --> 07:45.924
And there it is... the magic-related
clichÃ©s which sound profound

07:46.007 --> 07:47.425
but are actually meaningless.

07:47.509 --> 07:50.512
You know, I'm gonna miss those,
but I'm still not coming back.

07:51.971 --> 07:54.224
Kris is coming back this summer.

07:54.849 --> 07:56.768
- Darkwood?
- Kris Darkwood, yeah.

07:57.435 --> 08:00.730
So she would have her own cabin
and I would have my own cabin?

08:00.814 --> 08:04.776
Both of you will be working very closely
with the, young magicians.

08:04.859 --> 08:08.822
And the Top Hat? You still do that, right?
It's cabin versus cabin, winner takes all?

08:08.905 --> 08:11.866
Yes, I mean, you know
how the Top Hat competition works.

08:15.453 --> 08:19.833
Ooh, World Of Weiners. Nice.
Hope you got a reservation.

08:21.001 --> 08:23.128
Anyway, think about it.

08:23.211 --> 08:25.922
Because I know
you can still make 'em go...

08:30.635 --> 08:31.845
"Wow."

08:36.683 --> 08:38.643
That guy is good.

08:38.727 --> 08:40.729
Forgot my phone. Can you hand me my phone?

08:40.812 --> 08:43.273
Ooh. That would have been
a really cool exit.

08:43.356 --> 08:47.485
You know how many hot dogs I had to buy
so they would let me do that to the sign?

08:47.569 --> 08:51.990
A hundred. And I'm not proud to say
I ate 14 of them.

09:00.832 --> 09:03.001
- Here it is.
- Have fun, Paul.

09:05.545 --> 09:08.006
- Have fun.
- Bye-bye girls. Bye!

09:08.089 --> 09:09.090
Bye!

09:10.383 --> 09:12.719
These are all world-famous magicians?

09:13.887 --> 09:16.723
- They look like a bunch of ner...
- New friends to make.

09:16.806 --> 09:18.266
Tell me one more time.

09:18.350 --> 09:21.519
Poison ivy has three almond-shaped
leaflets, light green to red in color,

09:21.603 --> 09:23.104
often found near a water source.

09:23.188 --> 09:26.316
Often but not always, Nathan.
Come on, get your head in the game!

09:26.399 --> 09:29.110
Mother, Father,
I've got my EpiPen, my Phenergan,

09:29.194 --> 09:31.780
my bracelet that says "peanut allergy"
in ten languages.

09:31.863 --> 09:34.699
Plus I have my uropathy filter
in case I get stranded somewhere

09:34.783 --> 09:36.493
and have to drink my own pee.

09:36.576 --> 09:37.952
We've done all we can.

09:38.036 --> 09:40.455
Remember, don't be afraid of anything.

09:40.538 --> 09:42.874
Be afraid of everything.

09:44.042 --> 09:47.128
Where are the bunnies?
And what time is the first cuddle?

09:48.171 --> 09:50.173
I love bunnies too.

09:50.256 --> 09:51.466
They're delicious.

09:53.009 --> 09:55.261
Come on, son.

09:57.222 --> 09:59.808
Dad, do I really
have to wear this bow tie?

09:59.891 --> 10:02.018
It's like wearing a "kick me" sign
on my neck.

10:02.102 --> 10:05.271
Without that bow tie,
you are just another magician.

10:05.355 --> 10:09.484
But you're Kornelius Kessler's son...
Magic royalty.

10:09.567 --> 10:11.695
Now remember,
nothing but the Golden Wand will do.

10:12.612 --> 10:14.372
If you need me,
I'll be in Branson, Missouri.

10:15.156 --> 10:18.243
Your father instructed me
to tell you to have a good time.

10:18.326 --> 10:19.994
He also asked that I give you this.

10:22.247 --> 10:24.290
And your mother asked
that I give you this.

10:24.874 --> 10:25.875
One, two.

10:27.085 --> 10:28.795
And, Janelle, as always, I must request,

10:28.878 --> 10:31.023
since I would be the one
who would have to come find you,

10:31.047 --> 10:34.300
please don't run away
like you have at so many other camps.

10:34.384 --> 10:36.011
Maybe you could even try to participate.

10:36.553 --> 10:38.096
I make no promises, Hamilton.

10:38.930 --> 10:41.266
Maybe we can try
and make that attitude disappear.

10:47.355 --> 10:50.817
Andy Duckerman is back, baby!

10:56.990 --> 10:59.051
- Hey, where you going? I'm right here.
- It's Darkwood!

10:59.075 --> 11:01.619
Hi! How are you? Hi. Thank you.

11:01.703 --> 11:05.206
Hi. Hi. Do you guys like magic?

11:05.290 --> 11:06.833
Yeah!

11:20.472 --> 11:21.848
I still have to sign in.

11:21.931 --> 11:25.602
I don't know if I belong here.
I just play with cards in my room.

11:25.685 --> 11:27.937
I know you're scared,

11:28.021 --> 11:29.898
but remember why you came
in the first place.

11:31.608 --> 11:33.651
Honey, I miss him too.

11:34.527 --> 11:36.321
But let me ask you one thing.

11:37.405 --> 11:39.032
Do you love magic?

11:43.161 --> 11:45.372
Can we get outta here
before I get any geek on me?

11:46.373 --> 11:47.874
Don't worry about your room.

11:47.957 --> 11:50.293
I'll never have more than ten friends
in there at one time.

11:50.377 --> 11:52.879
Legend holds that many years ago,

11:52.962 --> 11:56.383
Roy Preston, the world's foremost...
No, check that, five-most

11:56.466 --> 11:59.761
tap dancing magician disappeared
in this very building

11:59.844 --> 12:04.808
and that if you scream very loud,
he might reappear.

12:12.190 --> 12:15.235
Welcome to Roy Preston's
Prememorial Theater.

12:18.113 --> 12:19.989
Can you clap twice for me?

12:20.907 --> 12:22.909
Can you stomp your feet?

12:22.992 --> 12:26.329
Now break it down. Yeah.

12:26.413 --> 12:28.581
How does everyone else know this?

12:28.665 --> 12:32.210
Bravo. Bravo. Very good.

12:32.293 --> 12:35.213
Welcome to the last summer session
of the institute.

12:35.296 --> 12:37.340
This summer you're gonna do your best,

12:37.424 --> 12:40.135
then you're gonna do better
than your best.

12:40.218 --> 12:44.514
And the cabin that does better
than the best of the best of the best

12:44.597 --> 12:46.307
at our final performance

12:46.391 --> 12:50.395
will win the coveted Top Hat award.

12:55.942 --> 12:59.946
And for the young magician who is deemed
to be the most exceptional...

13:01.573 --> 13:04.284
Whoa.

13:04.367 --> 13:05.577
The Golden Wand.

13:06.244 --> 13:07.829
- Whoa.
- Whoo.

13:08.496 --> 13:09.539
I've won three.

13:09.622 --> 13:14.044
Now guiding you on this journey
of self-discovery and magical mastery

13:14.127 --> 13:17.630
are some of the finest magicians
working today.

13:17.714 --> 13:20.925
Leading the Spades cabin, Xerxes!

13:24.679 --> 13:27.766
Welcome to a summer of snow.

13:33.313 --> 13:34.397
Whoa.

13:36.941 --> 13:41.237
And now, leader of the Clubs,
Lena Lambert!

13:44.115 --> 13:48.536
Who dares drink from the goblet of magic?

13:48.620 --> 13:50.622
Spooky.

13:57.045 --> 13:59.422
Whoa.

14:03.176 --> 14:05.178
Whoa!

14:14.145 --> 14:15.689
Whoa.

14:16.189 --> 14:19.192
Our next magician needs no introduction

14:19.275 --> 14:23.863
except she's the leader of the Diamonds,
Kristina Darkwood!

14:24.948 --> 14:27.617
Abracadabra, tiny humans.

14:27.701 --> 14:29.327
Whoa.

14:31.121 --> 14:33.498
It's wires, obviously. Please.

14:34.916 --> 14:37.794
I see you. I know your hopes.

14:37.877 --> 14:40.839
Who do you dream of being?
Tell your neighbor.

14:41.923 --> 14:44.259
Whisper it in his ear.

14:44.342 --> 14:46.344
Was it...

14:47.721 --> 14:48.722
Nick Jonas?

14:50.807 --> 14:52.642
Um, that's wrong.

14:52.726 --> 14:56.021
I dreamed of being Jonas Salk,
not a Jonas brother.

14:56.104 --> 14:57.480
- Who?
- Are you sure?

14:57.564 --> 15:01.401
Nick Jonas is super cute.
You could get lost in those eyes.

15:02.485 --> 15:07.323
Um, yes, he is very handsome.
But I'm sorry, I said Jonas Salk.

15:08.491 --> 15:10.577
Inventor of the polio vaccine.

15:11.745 --> 15:14.164
Godfather of antibiotics.

15:14.247 --> 15:15.874
My Jedi Master.

15:15.957 --> 15:18.960
I'm sorry. This is awkward.

15:19.044 --> 15:21.629
Maybe someone else took your dream.

15:21.713 --> 15:25.175
You! Sir, excuse me!

15:25.258 --> 15:29.262
I think you may have accidentally
taken this young boy's dream.

15:29.346 --> 15:32.432
No. I didn't take a child's dream.

15:32.515 --> 15:35.018
Think we all know there's only
one dream stealer in this room.

15:35.101 --> 15:37.520
Check your pocket.

15:45.445 --> 15:46.529
No way.

15:46.613 --> 15:47.655
Jonas Salk.

15:50.658 --> 15:52.369
Jonas Salk.

15:54.287 --> 15:55.288
Magic.

15:55.372 --> 15:59.000
No, it's not magic.
It's just statistics. Really.

15:59.084 --> 16:01.086
Eighty-two percent of people
say "Jonas Salk."

16:01.169 --> 16:03.254
It's so cool she's a counselor here.

16:03.338 --> 16:06.633
For our last counselor,
leader of the Hearts...

16:06.716 --> 16:08.176
David Blaine?

16:08.259 --> 16:11.137
- David Blaine? No way, really?
- Hey, hey.

16:13.390 --> 16:16.309
- It's, not David Blaine.
- Aw.

16:16.393 --> 16:21.189
But in his place
is one of the great institute legends,

16:21.272 --> 16:24.984
an incredible talent
whose work can be found

16:25.068 --> 16:29.781
all over the Vegas Strip and
the convention center and local airports,

16:29.864 --> 16:33.034
Mr. Andy Duckerman.

16:34.828 --> 16:38.540
Hey. What's up? I'm Andy.

16:38.623 --> 16:41.793
Would you like to come up on the stage?
Would you like to do some tricks?

16:41.876 --> 16:46.089
I didn't even bring any tricks... to do.

16:46.631 --> 16:47.841
You know what?

16:47.924 --> 16:51.970
I'm not gonna do a trick,
because it's your stage, guys.

16:52.053 --> 16:54.055
It's not mine.

16:54.139 --> 16:58.601
And I don't steal children's dreams,
'cause I don't have to.

16:58.685 --> 17:04.691
I've won the Golden Wand three times.
Boom!

17:11.906 --> 17:13.746
You know what?
I'm gonna grab these real quick.

17:13.825 --> 17:15.285
Carry on. Great stuff.

17:15.367 --> 17:17.328
- Thank you, Andy.
- Three times!

17:17.412 --> 17:19.622
Okay, so it's time for you
to find your way

17:19.705 --> 17:22.751
out back to your designated cabins.

17:22.834 --> 17:24.961
Um, how do we know where to go?

17:25.462 --> 17:28.381
Ruth, only you hold that answer.

17:29.549 --> 17:32.594
Yes! Diamonds are the best!

17:39.726 --> 17:43.229
Good news. We're in the same bunk.
Wanna share my humidifier?

17:44.481 --> 17:47.108
It was either this
or basketball camp with Steph Curry,

17:47.192 --> 17:50.445
but Mother said I had to have fun
this summer, so of course I chose this.

17:50.528 --> 17:53.239
- Hey, noobs.
- "Noobs"?

17:53.323 --> 17:58.244
Yeah, like "newbie." Like "new to camp,"
like "doesn't know the ropes."

17:58.912 --> 18:00.914
Doesn't have the "moves."

18:04.209 --> 18:06.628
The name's Vic. As in "victory."

18:06.711 --> 18:08.213
Last year's Golden Wand winner.

18:08.880 --> 18:11.007
Hey. Theo.

18:11.091 --> 18:14.177
Let me see you do a trick.
Time to trick the Vic.

18:14.260 --> 18:16.638
Um, okay. Sure.

18:16.721 --> 18:18.098
Um...

18:18.181 --> 18:21.059
- Pick a card. Any card.
- Think I've seen this one before.

18:21.142 --> 18:22.268
I haven't even started.

18:22.811 --> 18:25.522
I'm just messing with ya.

18:26.606 --> 18:27.899
Keep going, you're doing great.

18:28.525 --> 18:30.527
I just... Um...

18:37.867 --> 18:41.287
Okay, I'm gonna take
your queen of spades and...

18:45.000 --> 18:48.378
Don't worry. Just noob nerves.
Let me show you how it's done.

18:49.170 --> 18:52.424
So I have an empty cup
and a bottle of water.

18:52.507 --> 18:55.468
I'm gonna pour it in here
just so you see everything's legit.

18:56.511 --> 18:57.554
Ooh.

19:00.598 --> 19:02.100
Check this out.

19:05.311 --> 19:07.772
Empty. Ta-da!

19:08.356 --> 19:09.566
That was cool, Vic.

19:09.649 --> 19:12.193
Wait, but there's one more part
to this trick.

19:16.031 --> 19:17.741
That was uncalled for.

19:17.824 --> 19:21.286
Go run away with Jonas Salk.

19:21.369 --> 19:23.830
Good luck creating a dweeb vaccine!

19:23.913 --> 19:26.916
Magic camp. Even the bullies are nerds.

19:27.000 --> 19:29.461
It's good to be the king.

19:31.880 --> 19:34.507
- You're the best ever!
- Thank you so much.

19:36.259 --> 19:37.552
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

19:37.635 --> 19:40.263
I know you see me. I'm right here.

19:41.681 --> 19:44.351
Kristina. I didn't see you there.

19:44.434 --> 19:47.145
- Hi, Andy. It's been too long.
- I love you, Kristina!

19:47.228 --> 19:49.731
I was actually gonna say
it hasn't been long enough.

19:49.814 --> 19:51.608
- Thank you!
- . Well...

19:51.691 --> 19:54.694
I was actually surprised to see you here.
I thought you'd given up magic.

19:54.778 --> 19:56.154
I love you.

19:56.237 --> 19:59.199
Honestly I'm just doing Preston a favor.
Filling in for David Blaine.

19:59.282 --> 20:00.492
Kristina, you're the greatest.

20:00.575 --> 20:03.912
That's funny, 'cause Preston asked me
to step in for David this summer.

20:03.995 --> 20:06.748
Do you think maybe
he's just stroking your ego a little bit?

20:07.332 --> 20:09.092
I'm glad you're here.
It's good to give back.

20:09.167 --> 20:11.169
Mentor kids, train the next generation...

20:11.252 --> 20:13.797
To stab you in the back
when you least expect it.

20:13.880 --> 20:17.050
I really hoped that we were,
you know, past all this.

20:17.133 --> 20:21.346
I am. I'm cool.
I'm doing... I'm doing great, honestly.

20:21.429 --> 20:24.140
Doing private shows around the world
for super-important people.

20:24.224 --> 20:27.024
It's why you haven't seen me around,
why you haven't heard of my shows.

20:27.102 --> 20:30.105
But I assure you, it pays quite well.

20:30.188 --> 20:34.275
And that's why you're using
garbage bags as luggage.

20:34.859 --> 20:36.779
- It's a eco-friendly thing.
- It's actually not.

20:36.861 --> 20:40.031
Whatever. All I know is
that my bunk is gonna beat you

20:40.115 --> 20:42.325
just like I did every summer
when we were kids.

20:42.409 --> 20:44.744
- Fine. You're on.
- Fine. You're on.

20:44.828 --> 20:47.205
No, you're... What am I doing?

20:47.288 --> 20:50.000
We're here for the kids.
This is ridiculous.

20:50.083 --> 20:53.753
You know what's ridiculous?
How bad you're gonna lose.

21:00.593 --> 21:02.012
Nice.

21:02.804 --> 21:04.180
- Yes.
- Hi, guys!

21:04.889 --> 21:07.183
Welcome, Diamonds! Come on in.

21:07.267 --> 21:09.978
I'm the Vic,
last year's Golden Wand winner.

21:13.565 --> 21:14.607
Nice.

21:14.691 --> 21:17.610
It's like a cabin
from a horror movie.

21:17.694 --> 21:19.904
- Ew. Gross.
- It's like one giant splinter.

21:19.988 --> 21:22.157
Aw, man. I forgot my tetanus booster.

21:22.240 --> 21:24.659
Hey, where's the kid that got all wet?

21:27.287 --> 21:30.457
It's okay, Theo. Here's a dry shirt.

21:30.957 --> 21:32.667
Thanks.

21:32.751 --> 21:35.754
I can't believe Kristina Darkwood
is a counselor this summer.

21:35.837 --> 21:38.173
I heard when she was our age
she was a total dork,

21:38.256 --> 21:40.842
but then she got really good at magic
and became super famous.

21:40.925 --> 21:43.553
Yeah, I think we're all crossing
our fingers for that narrative.

21:43.636 --> 21:45.221
You guys talking about Dorkwood?

21:45.805 --> 21:49.017
Yeah, that's what we used to call her
when she was a camper here.

21:49.100 --> 21:50.935
Kristina Dorkwood.

21:51.019 --> 21:53.899
She never won the Golden Wand three years
in a row, but you know who did?

21:53.938 --> 21:55.690
- David Blaine?
- No.

21:55.774 --> 21:58.651
Actually, yes, he did. But so did I.

21:58.735 --> 22:02.113
I won, and Kristina lost every time to me.

22:02.197 --> 22:06.034
So, you should consider yourselves lucky
that you ended up with me and not her.

22:06.117 --> 22:07.452
Do you still perform?

22:07.535 --> 22:09.788
Yep. In private shows all over the world.

22:09.871 --> 22:11.748
I've never heard of your solo career,

22:11.831 --> 22:15.168
and I have an encyclopedic knowledge
of magicians both past and present.

22:15.251 --> 22:18.230
And I googled you. Your name only
comes up connected to Kristina Darkwood...

22:18.254 --> 22:19.756
Really? Let me see that.

22:21.383 --> 22:23.176
Whoa.

22:23.259 --> 22:25.512
Cool. How does it reappear?

22:25.595 --> 22:28.223
It doesn't.
Not until the last day of summer.

22:28.306 --> 22:31.226
- Camp rules.
- "No phones."

22:31.768 --> 22:35.855
And we're not here to talk about
my amazing and super-secret career.

22:35.939 --> 22:39.859
We're here to win the Top Hat
and the Golden Wand.

22:39.943 --> 22:43.405
So let me meet the young talent
Preston has gifted me with.

22:44.614 --> 22:47.450
You. What is your name?
What is your specialty?

22:47.534 --> 22:50.495
My name is Ruth Brusselbach,
and my specialty is bunnies.

22:51.788 --> 22:53.248
I don't know what that means.

22:53.331 --> 22:54.958
Technically, I've never worked with one,

22:55.041 --> 22:58.044
but ever since I saw a magician
pull a rabbit out of a hat,

22:58.128 --> 23:00.171
I knew it was my destiny.

23:00.255 --> 23:02.424
- So when does that happen?
- First thing tomorrow.

23:02.507 --> 23:04.676
- Yes.
- What about you? What's your deal?

23:04.759 --> 23:06.302
I'm Judd Kessler.

23:07.303 --> 23:09.305
Any relation to Kornelius Kessler?

23:09.723 --> 23:10.724
My dad.

23:11.099 --> 23:13.852
That's why you're wearing the bow tie!
It's just like your dad's.

23:13.935 --> 23:15.979
Yeah,
it's not my first choice of accessory.

23:16.062 --> 23:19.024
This guy's dad? Living legend.

23:19.107 --> 23:20.984
That must make you a magic thoroughbred.

23:21.067 --> 23:23.236
I'm not sure that's how magic works.

23:23.319 --> 23:25.780
It's more of a recessive gene
like eye color or blood type.

23:25.864 --> 23:27.049
Don't be shy. Show me somethin'.

23:27.073 --> 23:30.118
Look, I'm just trying to tell you
that I don't know how to do mag...

23:30.201 --> 23:32.388
I don't have to worry about you.
You can show me in the morning.

23:32.412 --> 23:33.413
'Kay.

23:35.081 --> 23:37.792
Zyrtec, you got a trick you wanna show me?

23:39.044 --> 23:41.713
That's actually my Zyrtec shirt. Big fan.

23:42.505 --> 23:45.216
Um, I'm Theo.

23:45.300 --> 23:47.385
And, um, not really.

23:47.469 --> 23:50.349
It doesn't need to be a new trick.
Just anything you learned last summer.

23:50.388 --> 23:53.266
This is actually my first year here.

23:53.350 --> 23:54.809
- Yep. Me too.
- Me too.

23:55.185 --> 23:56.811
You're all newbies?

23:56.895 --> 23:58.188
Yeah.

23:59.564 --> 24:03.276
Preston.

24:07.197 --> 24:10.533
Tina, Zozo, Alex.

24:10.617 --> 24:13.328
Wow. Really committed to this bunny thing.

24:14.120 --> 24:17.248
Bunny love is not a "thing."
It's a way of life.

24:17.332 --> 24:22.253
Like being a samurai...
only with more bunnies.

24:22.671 --> 24:24.339
Okay.

24:28.885 --> 24:31.680
Hey, I forgot to ask.
What's your specialty?

24:31.763 --> 24:33.306
I'm not sure. Cards, I guess.

24:33.390 --> 24:35.392
What did you put on your application?

24:35.767 --> 24:38.353
I don't know. My dad filled it out.

24:38.436 --> 24:41.523
Gotcha. And thanks again
for letting me take the bottom bunk.

24:41.940 --> 24:46.277
As I mentioned before, I'm a bit
of a night pee-er. And sleepwalker.

24:47.070 --> 24:49.155
Unfortunately, not always in that order.

24:49.614 --> 24:53.368
And sometimes, for no reason, I wake up
in the middle of the night screaming.

24:53.702 --> 24:55.286
Welp, see you at 4:00 a.m.

24:55.662 --> 24:58.915
Okay, guys. Lights out. Big day tomorrow.

24:58.998 --> 25:01.501
You get to prove to me
that I'm not wasting my time here.

25:01.584 --> 25:03.211
Alaka-zip-it.

25:03.294 --> 25:05.380
Cool!

25:07.507 --> 25:09.134
I don't think he likes us very much.

25:09.217 --> 25:13.138
He uses trash bags as luggage.
He clearly doesn't even like himself.

25:13.221 --> 25:16.641
Guys? I can hear you. I'm right here.

25:22.230 --> 25:24.733
Pick a card. Memorize it.

25:25.275 --> 25:26.401
Put it back.

25:28.361 --> 25:33.033
Okay. Now, you put your card
in the middle, right?

25:33.116 --> 25:34.117
Yeah.

25:34.784 --> 25:38.204
Then how come it reappeared at the top?

25:38.288 --> 25:40.415
Whoa. How did you do that?

25:40.498 --> 25:42.959
A magician never reveals his secrets.

25:43.043 --> 25:46.546
But if I give these cards to you,
then I can teach you.

25:50.133 --> 25:52.552
Good morning, campers.

25:52.635 --> 25:55.055
Thirty-four days
until the Top Hat competition.

25:55.138 --> 25:57.557
Time to focus on some hocus-pocus.

25:57.640 --> 26:00.143
Lunch will be spaghetti in red sauce.

26:00.226 --> 26:04.898
Escape is a fundamental element
in every true magician's arsenal.

26:04.981 --> 26:09.319
So we're gonna be doing
the most basic of escapes.

26:09.402 --> 26:12.030
Hands tied in front. Very easy.

26:12.113 --> 26:15.325
Look, I just did it. Okay, let's try it.

26:15.658 --> 26:18.203
Okay, rub your hands
on the back of the knot. On the back.

26:18.286 --> 26:21.164
Do not bite it. Do not bite it.

26:21.247 --> 26:23.458
That is not the back.
That is not right at all.

26:24.125 --> 26:26.461
- Back of the ha...
- Somebody help me!

26:26.544 --> 26:28.963
What? Wow, how did you do...

26:29.047 --> 26:30.847
That is very wrong,
but I'm impressed by that.

26:30.924 --> 26:32.425
Can't feel my thigh.

26:32.759 --> 26:35.512
Okay, let's try something simpler.

26:35.595 --> 26:36.721
Close-up magic.

26:36.805 --> 26:39.474
This is called a false transfer.

26:39.891 --> 26:42.060
You think I put it in my left hand.

26:42.143 --> 26:44.104
It's in my right.

26:44.187 --> 26:45.814
Okay? Let's try it.

26:46.940 --> 26:48.483
Bad. Very bad.

26:48.566 --> 26:49.567
Bad.

26:49.651 --> 26:52.362
Nate, that's pretty good.

26:52.445 --> 26:54.197
It's stuck in my throat.

26:55.949 --> 26:58.451
Wait, are you serious?
Does anyone know the Heimlich?

26:58.535 --> 27:00.203
No? Nurse!

27:02.205 --> 27:07.794
Okay, welcome to manipulation manor.

27:08.294 --> 27:11.381
Obviously, fluffy red balls
are too complicated,

27:11.464 --> 27:14.217
so let's work on
some basic animal handling.

27:14.634 --> 27:18.263
Not even magic-related, just simple
petting-zoo-level interactions.

27:18.972 --> 27:21.933
Ha! That skunk's name is Fred.

27:22.017 --> 27:23.226
That's crazy funny.

27:23.309 --> 27:27.105
Does one person
care for all 56 animals here?

27:27.188 --> 27:29.149
- Is that how many animals there are?
- Yeah.

27:29.232 --> 27:31.109
- Yes.
- How'd you know that?

27:31.192 --> 27:32.569
- It's obvious.
- Guys!

27:32.652 --> 27:34.279
Who cares how many animals there are?

27:34.362 --> 27:40.285
Why are these adorable bunnies next
to those horrifying birds and snakes?

27:40.368 --> 27:42.037
And more importantly,

27:42.120 --> 27:44.456
why aren't the bunnies
in my hands right now?

27:44.539 --> 27:46.750
Yes, Ruth. All right.

27:46.833 --> 27:48.936
All you've talked about
since you got here are bunnies,

27:48.960 --> 27:52.172
so for your first
impossible-to-mess-up exercise,

27:52.255 --> 27:56.760
I want you to simply...
hold the bunny.

28:09.647 --> 28:10.940
Why are you crying?

28:11.024 --> 28:14.944
It's just so... cute.

28:15.028 --> 28:16.321
It actually hurts.

28:16.404 --> 28:19.407
I can't stand it. The cuteness hurts.

28:19.491 --> 28:23.119
Put it back. Put it back!
Don't you dare put it back.

28:24.245 --> 28:25.622
Good morning, campers.

28:25.705 --> 28:28.249
Twenty-eight days
until the Top Hat competition.

28:28.333 --> 28:29.417
Keep at your training.

28:29.501 --> 28:31.461
And today's lunch is a special treat...

28:31.544 --> 28:35.382
Leftover hot dogs,
courtesy of World Of Weiners, Las Vegas.

28:36.091 --> 28:37.842
Great job, guys. Amazing.

28:38.760 --> 28:40.470
Why doesn't Andy teach us like that?

28:40.553 --> 28:42.753
And why does everyone else
get their own cabin T-shirts?

28:42.806 --> 28:45.058
Man, we were this close
to having David Blaine.

28:45.141 --> 28:47.102
Guys, again, right here.

28:47.185 --> 28:50.146
Great.
Your first magic trick of the whole camp.

28:50.230 --> 28:52.440
Right?

28:52.524 --> 28:54.442
You wanna snap it.

28:54.526 --> 28:56.194
All right, I wanna see you guys.

28:57.320 --> 29:00.490
Make sure you have follow-through
with your wrist. Okay, that's better.

29:02.242 --> 29:03.618
Preston, can...

29:06.871 --> 29:08.873
Can we not do this right now?

29:08.957 --> 29:10.917
I know you're in here, Preston.

29:11.001 --> 29:14.129
Hiding in some trapdoor or hidden corner,

29:14.212 --> 29:17.507
waiting for me to turn around
so you can magically appear and say,

29:17.590 --> 29:19.910
- "I've been right here the whole time."
- the whole time.

29:19.968 --> 29:22.012
Exactly. You're so predictable.

29:22.095 --> 29:25.223
- What's the problem?
- The bunk that you gave me is the problem.

29:25.306 --> 29:28.560
These kids, Preston, they're all newbies.
They have zero skills.

29:28.643 --> 29:32.355
Now, you understand that this is a camp
for children who wanna learn magic,

29:32.439 --> 29:33.648
and you're here to teach them.

29:33.732 --> 29:35.692
Preston, these kids, they're hopeless.

29:35.775 --> 29:37.736
Nathan choked on a sponge ball.

29:37.819 --> 29:41.197
Ruth can't even touch a bunny.
And she loves bunnies.

29:41.281 --> 29:43.366
They can't even pull off
the most basic card trick.

29:43.450 --> 29:46.286
But you see,
a trick that you don't believe is a trick,

29:46.369 --> 29:47.579
that's the best trick of all.

29:47.662 --> 29:49.222
That's the advice you're gonna give me?

29:49.247 --> 29:51.082
Just more generic magical proverbs

29:51.166 --> 29:54.294
that sound meaningful
but are total nonsense?

29:54.377 --> 29:57.672
Andy, the only way
to create more magic in the world

29:57.756 --> 30:00.091
is not by creating more magic.

30:00.175 --> 30:02.594
- Yep. Just like that.
- Andy, let me finish.

30:02.677 --> 30:03.845
- No, I'm done.
- It's...

30:03.928 --> 30:07.474
I'm sorry, Preston, but I'm done.
I'm outta here. Okay?

30:10.435 --> 30:11.436
Stupid.

30:12.395 --> 30:14.314
I was doing perfectly fine.

30:14.689 --> 30:19.069
Well, not great. I was doing good.
Was doing good-ish. Sort of.

30:33.500 --> 30:35.126
I could be mistaken,

30:35.919 --> 30:40.340
but I think I saw a 12-year-old execute
a perfect faro shuffle with one hand.

30:40.423 --> 30:41.591
I was just fooling around.

30:41.675 --> 30:45.804
A faro shuffle is one of the single
most difficult card skills with two hands,

30:45.887 --> 30:47.972
and you just did it with one, I think.

30:48.431 --> 30:50.517
- Do it again.
- I don't want to.

30:50.600 --> 30:53.311
- Why not? You just did it.
- I get scared.

30:55.480 --> 30:58.358
- Scared of what?
- I don't know. People looking at me.

30:59.401 --> 31:01.820
Anyway, it's stupid. Just...

31:01.903 --> 31:03.613
You know what that is?

31:03.697 --> 31:05.323
That is stage fright.

31:05.657 --> 31:08.785
Gets in your head. And that is
a freaky place for a magician to be.

31:09.244 --> 31:12.747
- It's happened to you before?
- No. Don't be ridiculous.

31:12.831 --> 31:15.250
Although, I am an acclaimed professional.

31:15.333 --> 31:19.796
You, on the other hand, are a rank amateur
who can somehow do a perfect faro shuffle.

31:19.879 --> 31:21.464
So let me see it.

31:22.298 --> 31:24.443
- Like I said...
- Pretend I'm not here. Don't look at me.

31:24.467 --> 31:26.761
Keep shuffling.
Keep the cards moving. Okay?

31:27.929 --> 31:29.681
So where you from?

31:30.765 --> 31:32.517
Lancaster, California.

31:32.600 --> 31:33.810
That sounds...

31:34.978 --> 31:37.564
That sounds boring, actually.
I'm not gonna lie to you.

31:37.647 --> 31:39.983
It's okay. Maybe a little boring.

31:40.775 --> 31:43.903
We live near Edwards Air Force Base.
Lot of military families.

31:44.320 --> 31:45.905
Is your dad in the service?

31:45.989 --> 31:47.365
He was.

31:48.074 --> 31:50.952
Um, these were his cards.

31:52.454 --> 31:55.957
Hey! Do you have any brothers or sisters?

31:56.332 --> 31:59.669
I have a little brother named Cameron.
He's the worst.

31:59.753 --> 32:02.130
- Super annoying?
- Yeah, totally.

32:02.547 --> 32:05.842
Dude, you're great. Show me your routine.

32:06.593 --> 32:09.387
Okay. Um, just take a card.

32:10.055 --> 32:12.724
All right.

32:12.807 --> 32:14.309
Now put it on top for me.

32:15.143 --> 32:16.144
Okay.

32:17.020 --> 32:18.021
And, um...

32:21.941 --> 32:23.943
Hey, relax.

32:24.027 --> 32:26.112
It's just you and me.

32:26.196 --> 32:27.822
Okay, try again.

32:30.617 --> 32:31.951
Relax.

32:32.452 --> 32:34.162
It's just you and me.

32:39.417 --> 32:41.920
Okay, three of diamonds.

32:43.004 --> 32:45.799
'Kay? Just gonna put that in there.

32:45.882 --> 32:48.426
- Now can you just tuck it in for me?
- Sure.

32:51.888 --> 32:53.056
Is this your card?

32:53.139 --> 32:55.934
My God, Theo!

32:56.017 --> 32:57.644
You are amazing.

32:58.269 --> 33:00.021
Nah, I just know some tricks.

33:00.105 --> 33:02.065
No, you are a magician.

33:02.899 --> 33:05.402
- Thanks.
- I can work with this.

33:05.485 --> 33:07.529
Too bad your bunkmates are so useless.

33:07.612 --> 33:11.991
Nathan is a genius with numbers,
and Judd knows a lot about...

33:12.075 --> 33:15.203
We need to have a little talk with
your bunk right now. Let's go. Come on.

33:15.620 --> 33:16.788
Guys, hey.

33:16.871 --> 33:20.166
What if I told you we have
at least some semblance of a shot

33:20.250 --> 33:21.668
to win the Top Hat competition?

33:21.751 --> 33:24.045
I'd say my blood sugar is really low.

33:24.129 --> 33:28.091
No, I'm serious.
Theo is apparently a secret Cardini,

33:28.174 --> 33:31.803
and he tells me that you guys
don't suck half as bad as I thought.

33:32.345 --> 33:35.598
Which I find hard to believe,
but let's not make a liar out of him.

33:35.682 --> 33:38.518
Are you messing with us
as a punishment for being awful at magic?

33:38.601 --> 33:41.771
I'm serious.
As a three-time Golden Wand winner and...

33:41.855 --> 33:44.065
Wait. You won the Golden Wand?

33:44.149 --> 33:45.817
We've heard. Now can we eat?

33:45.900 --> 33:49.029
- In a second. I'm addressing you.
- Can you address us while we eat?

33:49.112 --> 33:52.991
No, no. I had envisioned
this whole rousing speech thing first.

33:53.074 --> 33:56.703
You don't get to do the whole rousing
speech thing until you teach us stuff.

33:56.786 --> 33:58.705
Okay, fair point. But hear me out.

33:58.788 --> 34:01.875
If we can find the areas
where you don't totally stink,

34:01.958 --> 34:05.086
I can train you
to be sort of decent magicians.

34:05.170 --> 34:09.841
And with Theo's skills, we might
actually be able to beat Darkwood.

34:10.592 --> 34:13.719
I mean, win the Top Hat competition!

34:13.803 --> 34:15.096
Who's with me?

34:15.179 --> 34:18.891
Okay, this is where you guys start going,
"Andy! Andy!"

34:18.975 --> 34:20.518
If we say yes, can we eat?

34:21.895 --> 34:22.896
- Yes!
- Okay.

34:22.978 --> 34:26.608
- Finally.
- Let's fuel up. We got work to do.

34:26.690 --> 34:28.109
Walk towards me.

34:28.777 --> 34:31.487
Not so stiff, okay? Walk naturally.

34:31.571 --> 34:33.782
Hold your hands
as if they're actually empty.

34:35.992 --> 34:39.579
Now they are actually empty.
Come on, guys. This is Palming 101.

34:40.746 --> 34:42.998
Nathan, don't tell me you're allergic
to Tsum Tsums.

34:43.083 --> 34:45.126
No. But I'm allergic to dirt.

34:45.210 --> 34:49.630
Okay, guys, we are taking it
to the next level with straitjackets.

34:49.714 --> 34:52.342
You know, this is nice, actually.
It's kind of like a hug.

34:52.884 --> 34:55.344
- It is, isn't it?
- Hey, Andy, could you reapply for me?

34:55.428 --> 34:57.472
Yeah. Yeah, I got you, bud.

34:58.181 --> 34:59.241
- Thank you.
- Tell me when.

34:59.265 --> 35:00.266
That's good.

35:00.350 --> 35:01.351
- You good?
- Yes.

35:01.434 --> 35:03.436
- This is impossible.
- No, it isn't.

35:03.520 --> 35:08.358
Houdini once said,
"My brain is the key that sets me free."

35:08.441 --> 35:09.693
Was Houdini Irish?

35:09.776 --> 35:11.629
No, he was Hungarian.
That was a bad impression.

35:11.653 --> 35:16.658
Okay, exhale fully, then use that slack
to reach your arm all the way back.

35:17.325 --> 35:19.119
Whoo.

35:19.202 --> 35:21.454
All right! Now you're getting it.
High five.

35:22.205 --> 35:23.415
Of course.

35:23.498 --> 35:25.667
- Ooh.
- That is my bad.

35:26.209 --> 35:27.585
Yes!

35:27.669 --> 35:29.629
Now do I get to work with the bunnies?

35:29.713 --> 35:32.507
Ruth,
you are nowhere near bunny-ready.

35:32.590 --> 35:34.884
Why are you messing
with my emotions like this?

35:35.552 --> 35:38.430
Well, before you run,
you gotta learn how to crawl.

35:38.513 --> 35:42.100
Which leads me to... the turtles.

35:42.183 --> 35:45.395
Tiny and slow, just like you guys.
Go ahead, grab one.

35:45.478 --> 35:48.481
Bunny pile! I'm ready for my cuddles!

35:48.565 --> 35:50.316
Come to me, my friends!

35:50.400 --> 35:51.526
Get 'em! Quickly!

35:51.609 --> 35:53.111
Ruth! No!

35:53.194 --> 35:54.529
- Drop the turtles.
- Come back!

35:54.612 --> 35:57.032
- No! They're getting out!
- Where are you going?

35:57.115 --> 35:59.868
In the box. Grab a bunny!
Everybody, everybody, just get 'em.

35:59.951 --> 36:01.661
- Where are you going?
- Get the bunnies!

36:01.745 --> 36:05.540
Exhale to create some slack.
Get your arm up over your shoulder.

36:05.623 --> 36:06.958
Keep 'em away from the water!

36:07.042 --> 36:10.003
Over there!

36:10.086 --> 36:11.087
Man down!

36:11.796 --> 36:14.674
Well, that's one cabin we don't have
to worry about for Top Hat.

36:15.842 --> 36:18.011
Vic, what did I tell you?
Be nice.

36:19.971 --> 36:21.222
Stop those bunnies!

36:21.306 --> 36:23.641
- Ew. Gross.
- Get 'em!

36:23.725 --> 36:25.602
- Over there!
- Yeah, I just screamed that.

36:26.186 --> 36:28.688
- Concentrate on your straitjackets.
- They're getting away!

36:28.772 --> 36:31.066
- Where's Janelle?
- Pathetic. Grab the bunny.

36:31.149 --> 36:33.610
Why are you running from me?

36:34.027 --> 36:35.111
I got one!

36:35.612 --> 36:37.614
- Wait. No, I didn't...
- Under the bush!

36:38.698 --> 36:39.866
Gotcha!

36:40.450 --> 36:41.868
No, don't go!

36:41.951 --> 36:44.371
I'm just looking for the bunnies
that got away.

36:44.829 --> 36:47.207
- Do I look like a bunny?
- What? No.

36:47.749 --> 36:51.419
Well, maybe a little.
I mean, like, cute like a bunny.

36:51.503 --> 36:54.839
Well, not cute-cute.
Not that you're not cute.

36:54.923 --> 36:58.927
He wouldn't trick the Vic,
so I palmed his phone into a Big Gulp.

36:59.010 --> 37:02.889
How'd you get with the Diamonds anyway?
You seem nice.

37:02.972 --> 37:05.767
My parents probably paid extra
for me to be with Darkwood.

37:05.850 --> 37:07.227
That's pretty cool of them.

37:07.310 --> 37:09.187
They're not trying to be cool.

37:09.270 --> 37:12.524
They just don't want me getting in the way
of their busy work schedule.

37:14.484 --> 37:16.194
- Hey, is that Janelle?
- Yeah.

37:16.277 --> 37:19.280
- She's so weird.
- Um, I gotta bounce.

37:19.364 --> 37:22.742
I saw you get out of that straitjacket.
How did you do that?

37:22.826 --> 37:25.328
I don't know. It's just fun.

37:25.412 --> 37:27.831
Like a puzzle you do with your body,
I guess.

37:29.332 --> 37:31.751
Okay, now I really gotta go.

37:31.835 --> 37:33.878
I'm Janelle, by the way.

37:34.713 --> 37:35.714
Theo.

37:39.300 --> 37:41.302
Seventeen days until Top Hat.

37:41.386 --> 37:43.013
Lunch will be casserole.

37:43.096 --> 37:44.806
It is unclear what kind.

37:44.889 --> 37:48.560
This is what we call the French drop.
You see?

37:48.643 --> 37:51.563
You got to protect the angle
from the audience.

37:51.646 --> 37:53.126
- Ooh, ooh.
- All right, you guys try.

37:55.859 --> 37:58.153
That was surprisingly not terrible, Ruth.

37:58.236 --> 37:59.446
Thanks, Andy.

38:05.577 --> 38:06.870
Attaboy, Andy.

38:06.953 --> 38:11.082
Seems like you guys have been listening
to my amazing teaching after all.

38:11.166 --> 38:13.710
Magic isn't exactly a cardio workout.

38:13.793 --> 38:17.714
Your parents are insisting we try to get
you some physical activity this summer,

38:17.797 --> 38:18.965
so... look alive.

38:24.012 --> 38:26.514
Okay, workout over! Back to magic!

38:26.598 --> 38:30.810
Vanish... and appearance!

38:31.811 --> 38:33.730
Wow. Good job.

38:34.814 --> 38:38.526
Okay, I think it's time
we take things to the next level.

38:38.610 --> 38:39.652
Whoa!

38:39.736 --> 38:42.989
What?
I said I wanted to work with bunnies,

38:43.073 --> 38:45.992
not those terrifying,
flying poop-machines.

38:46.076 --> 38:48.536
Well, Ruth,
you liberated all of the bunnies,

38:48.620 --> 38:51.373
so this is what we have to work with.

38:51.456 --> 38:52.874
Raise out your finger.

38:54.125 --> 38:56.461
Doves are like flying bunnies.

38:56.544 --> 38:59.172
They're an extension
of a magician's emotions.

38:59.255 --> 39:02.050
If you're confident, it's confident.
If you're nervous...

39:02.133 --> 39:03.593
Whoa!

39:05.136 --> 39:06.596
Then that happens.

39:11.476 --> 39:13.019
And apparently so does that.

39:13.103 --> 39:14.270
Okay, Hearts.

39:14.354 --> 39:20.151
I think you're ready to hear one
of the biggest secrets in all of magic.

39:20.235 --> 39:23.655
Behind every great magician, there is...

39:23.738 --> 39:25.907
An even better tailor.

39:27.492 --> 39:30.412
- Nice.
- That sports coat is amazing.

39:30.870 --> 39:35.000
Judd, am I sensing
an enthusiasm for costumes?

39:38.128 --> 39:42.716
Welcome to the fabulous world
of costume design.

39:45.010 --> 39:48.304
Think I'm gonna spend the rest
of the day here, if that's cool with you.

39:48.805 --> 39:50.974
Ruth, maybe you just need
something bigger.

39:53.518 --> 39:55.395
Now, Ethan, she's not food, okay?

40:04.320 --> 40:05.447
Whoa.

40:06.239 --> 40:08.700
Hawks are my thing now.

40:08.783 --> 40:12.078
Birds love the color green.
It's like... It's like you're a tree.

40:16.750 --> 40:18.418
All right, come with me.

40:21.755 --> 40:23.715
Hey, Dad. I got a new trick.

40:23.798 --> 40:26.176
I-I can't right now, Theo.
I'm late for my flight.

40:26.259 --> 40:29.512
- Do it for your mom.
- Mom's not into magic. Please?

40:30.263 --> 40:32.974
- Yeah. Okay. Okay.
- All right.

40:33.058 --> 40:34.476
Pick a card.

40:34.934 --> 40:35.935
There we go.

40:36.019 --> 40:38.730
All right. Now don't let me see
it's the jack of hearts.

40:40.440 --> 40:42.067
Okay.

40:42.150 --> 40:43.777
That's pretty good. How'd you know?

40:43.860 --> 40:45.862
'Cause that's me. I'm the jack of hearts.

40:45.945 --> 40:49.407
And... that's you.

40:50.575 --> 40:53.161
- You're the king of hearts.
- How did you do...

40:53.244 --> 40:55.163
That's incredible.
You're incredible, Theo.

40:55.246 --> 40:57.499
Theo. Theo.

40:57.582 --> 41:01.169
Look, everyone's acts are shaping up,
but neither of us have one yet.

41:01.628 --> 41:04.839
So I was thinking we could form
a magical comedy duo

41:04.923 --> 41:09.135
with me doing plucky banter while you
wow everyone with your card magic.

41:09.219 --> 41:12.472
I've read that fart sounds
are quite the crowd-pleaser.

41:12.555 --> 41:16.643
You sneak me even a bit of cheese,
and I will blow the roof off this place.

41:16.726 --> 41:19.562
- Nate, definitely don't fart on the crowd.
- Okay.

41:19.646 --> 41:22.023
Why aren't you guys working?
The show's next week.

41:22.107 --> 41:24.109
I'm still trying to figure out
my specialty.

41:24.192 --> 41:26.736
Yeah, that is a tricky one.

41:26.820 --> 41:29.322
Hey, Nate,
how many seats are in this theater?

41:30.365 --> 41:31.991
273. Why?

41:32.075 --> 41:34.869
Why? Because it's freakish
how quickly you could do that.

41:34.953 --> 41:37.038
You've got something special
that no one else has.

41:37.622 --> 41:41.543
A protruding tailbone is actually
more common than you'd expect.

41:41.626 --> 41:43.688
He's talking about the way
you do your counting stuff.

41:43.712 --> 41:48.133
Yeah, I just count.
I count and group and multiply and...

41:48.216 --> 41:49.718
That's magic.

41:49.801 --> 41:53.722
Your brain is like a big,
weird magic calculator.

41:53.805 --> 41:56.057
You could be a mentalist.

41:56.141 --> 41:57.392
Like Kris Darkwood?

41:57.475 --> 41:59.644
Better than Kris Dorkwood.

42:00.145 --> 42:02.355
- I need to sit down.
- You are.

42:13.324 --> 42:14.659
Very nice.

42:15.910 --> 42:17.871
Looking good, guys. Whoo!

42:17.954 --> 42:19.956
- Andy, come here.
- Okay.

42:21.875 --> 42:22.959
Whoa.

42:24.294 --> 42:25.295
Yep.

42:26.379 --> 42:28.673
- Good. Yes!
- That looked so good.

42:29.591 --> 42:31.676
Okay, Theo, show us what you got.

42:38.308 --> 42:41.644
- Unbelievable.
- Okay, let's take ten.

42:42.520 --> 42:44.481
You guys,
keep working on your pinky break.

42:44.564 --> 42:46.358
Nathan, give your pinky a break.

42:46.983 --> 42:50.320
- It was an itch, not a pick. I swear.
- Okay, yeah, cool, all right.

42:50.403 --> 42:52.739
Dude, what's going on?
You're still in your head.

42:53.198 --> 42:55.468
You know what? Follow me.
There's something you need to see.

42:55.492 --> 42:56.743
Come on.

43:01.873 --> 43:03.667
Preston's secret library.

43:04.501 --> 43:06.628
He took me here when I was about your age.

43:06.711 --> 43:09.964
He said it was for
only truly exceptional magicians.

43:10.799 --> 43:12.425
Go ahead, check it out.

43:28.024 --> 43:29.526
It's an owl.

43:33.905 --> 43:35.448
Is that you and Darkwood?

43:36.199 --> 43:38.201
Wow.

43:38.827 --> 43:39.828
Yep.

43:40.662 --> 43:43.623
- Yeah, that's us.
- The "Abraca-Duo"?

43:43.707 --> 43:47.210
Hey, don't judge.
It was a very catchy name at the time.

43:48.086 --> 43:50.088
So, why do you hate each other now?

43:52.966 --> 43:54.217
Wow. Um...

43:55.093 --> 43:57.053
When we were campers, we were close.

43:57.137 --> 43:58.763
âª I put a spell on you âª

43:58.847 --> 44:00.098
I was like the cool...

44:00.181 --> 44:01.683
older superstar of the camp

44:01.766 --> 44:04.060
and she was kinda my protÃ©gÃ©e.

44:05.061 --> 44:07.480
âª Because you're mine âª

44:09.607 --> 44:11.526
After school, we became partners.

44:11.609 --> 44:13.737
At first,
we just did a lot of street magic.

44:13.820 --> 44:15.321
âª Stop the things you do âª

44:15.405 --> 44:18.950
But word got around and pretty soon
we were booking real gigs.

44:19.951 --> 44:22.871
Not to brag,
but we were pretty amazing together.

44:26.041 --> 44:29.586
I know it's kinda hard to believe,
but we actually used to be a couple.

44:29.669 --> 44:31.713
It's obvious.

44:33.423 --> 44:36.926
I mean, you can tell
she still has feelings for you.

44:37.010 --> 44:38.470
- I know, right?
- Yeah.

44:38.553 --> 44:40.680
It's like, get over it, you know?

44:42.140 --> 44:46.061
Anyway, we started doing
bigger and bigger theaters,

44:46.144 --> 44:47.937
trying to get our own show in Vegas.

44:48.813 --> 44:52.275
Then she went behind my back.

44:52.359 --> 44:54.736
Took a meeting with a big TV booker
without me.

44:55.320 --> 44:59.282
When I found out,
we got in this huge fight and we broke up.

44:59.657 --> 45:03.370
She did the solo TV gig
and skyrocketed to fame.

45:04.287 --> 45:07.374
I also started to perform solo, but...

45:10.251 --> 45:13.755
It was rough.

45:14.756 --> 45:18.051
One night I did a show
for just one person... Tony.

45:18.677 --> 45:20.261
He worked on my car earlier that day.

45:20.345 --> 45:22.889
Can you imagine just doing magic
for one person?

45:22.972 --> 45:27.185
I can. That's why I did magic.
For my dad.

45:29.521 --> 45:31.189
I'd only perform for him.

45:31.940 --> 45:34.025
But now, he's, um...

45:36.986 --> 45:38.697
- He...
- Hey, it's okay.

45:40.281 --> 45:42.200
We don't have to talk about that now.

45:42.659 --> 45:44.494
Come on, let's get out of here.

45:54.963 --> 45:56.881
- Going somewhere?
- Let me out.

45:57.382 --> 46:01.261
You've been pulling this all summer,
sneaking away before practice.

46:01.344 --> 46:03.471
You know you chose to come here?

46:03.555 --> 46:05.974
Not really.
I've never even done magic before.

46:06.057 --> 46:08.727
- My parents just sent me away.
- I'm sorry.

46:08.810 --> 46:10.270
That's really not fair.

46:10.353 --> 46:12.230
Okay, you get it. So let me out.

46:12.313 --> 46:13.732
Could do that.

46:13.815 --> 46:17.152
But what if you chose to look at
this whole summer as a kind of challenge?

46:17.235 --> 46:19.738
Like that constrictor knot
holding this net.

46:19.821 --> 46:20.822
What do you mean?

46:20.905 --> 46:24.159
Well, you're stuck here at camp,
just like you're stuck in this net.

46:24.242 --> 46:27.120
You didn't choose either situation,
but they happened.

46:27.579 --> 46:28.788
So, you have two options.

46:28.872 --> 46:33.543
You can continue being unhappy and stuck,
or you can do something about it.

46:34.044 --> 46:35.462
Change your situation.

46:35.545 --> 46:38.089
I've seen what you can do
with that straitjacket.

46:48.183 --> 46:50.060
- Whoa!
- Whoa!

46:52.270 --> 46:53.646
Ha!

46:53.730 --> 46:55.315
Good day, campers.

46:55.398 --> 46:58.443
Just five days
until the Top Hat competition.

46:58.526 --> 47:01.613
But remember, you are not competing
with each other, but yourselves.

47:01.696 --> 47:02.906
And also each other.

47:02.989 --> 47:06.409
Please report any loose bunny sightings
to the maintenance staff.

47:07.077 --> 47:08.370
Lunch will be rabbit.

47:09.204 --> 47:11.206
Kidding. Ham salad.

47:13.875 --> 47:16.670
- Um, what are you guys doing?
- We're waiting here for you.

47:16.753 --> 47:21.174
I've got some great news
and some less-than-great news.

47:21.257 --> 47:23.259
I think I know
how to cure your stage fright.

47:23.343 --> 47:26.054
That's amazing.
What's the less-great news?

47:26.137 --> 47:28.682
It's called the gauntlet.
And it may get messy.

47:29.140 --> 47:30.684
Just show us some cardistry.

47:30.934 --> 47:33.103
You did it for me before.
You can do it again.

47:33.186 --> 47:34.437
I don't think I can.

47:34.521 --> 47:36.523
Don't think, just do it.

47:36.606 --> 47:38.191
And be prepared for anything.

47:38.566 --> 47:39.693
Let's go. Show us.

47:39.776 --> 47:42.445
That's it. Yeah, good job, Theo.

47:42.529 --> 47:44.239
Ruth, Nathan, now.

47:45.365 --> 47:46.991
The distance between two points...

47:47.075 --> 47:49.244
is the square root of X of 200.

47:49.327 --> 47:51.413
Hey, focus up, okay?

47:51.496 --> 47:53.415
Block everything else out.
It's just you and me.

47:57.544 --> 48:01.297
Yes, great job. Now, friffle into cascade.
Right into it.

48:02.382 --> 48:04.009
Judd, Vera, now!

48:07.053 --> 48:09.264
Okay, now charlier into L cuts.

48:14.853 --> 48:16.104
Yes!

48:16.187 --> 48:18.064
I knew you could do it.

48:21.234 --> 48:22.235
Seriously?

48:23.737 --> 48:26.489
It's on.

48:26.573 --> 48:28.700
Magic fight!

48:37.208 --> 48:38.585
We got him!

48:42.881 --> 48:44.758
- My...
- Wait, where'd he go?

48:44.841 --> 48:46.801
He's like a magic ninja.

48:46.885 --> 48:48.511
Ha ha!

49:00.398 --> 49:02.359
You think you got me
where you want me.

49:02.442 --> 49:05.737
But maybe I got you
right where I want you.

49:06.446 --> 49:07.697
Alaka-zip-it.

49:15.330 --> 49:16.456
Lucky Charms?

49:16.831 --> 49:19.250
"They're magically delicious." Get it?

49:19.334 --> 49:20.335
We get it.

49:20.418 --> 49:22.003
How'd you even know?

49:22.087 --> 49:23.672
Because I am a magic ninja.

49:23.755 --> 49:24.923
Our clothes are ruined.

49:26.091 --> 49:27.717
I think I got us covered.

50:00.583 --> 50:04.671
Yeah, but at least think about it.

50:05.422 --> 50:08.883
It's only a short flight away, right?
Okay, bye.

50:10.301 --> 50:13.972
Hey, they finally added
a nondairy option to the ice cream bar.

50:14.055 --> 50:17.308
Look, it's one of the broken Hearts.

50:17.392 --> 50:18.727
Where do you think you're going?

50:18.810 --> 50:21.438
I was just gonna get
some No Cream Ice Dream.

50:21.521 --> 50:23.148
You really can't taste the difference.

50:23.690 --> 50:26.401
I don't know. It looks like
you're trying to trick the Vic.

50:26.484 --> 50:29.320
- Trick the Vic. Trick the Vic.
- No, I'm not.

50:29.404 --> 50:33.241
And it's a bit awkward
that you refer to yourself as "the Vic."

50:33.908 --> 50:35.118
Pick a card.

50:35.702 --> 50:37.120
Um, I'd rather not.

50:37.203 --> 50:39.873
Pick... a... card.

50:40.248 --> 50:41.249
'Kay.

50:42.334 --> 50:43.501
Okay, memorize it.

50:45.545 --> 50:50.008
Now, I'm going to deal out the four aces
in order from best to worst.

50:50.759 --> 50:54.054
Diamonds, spades, clubs,

50:54.137 --> 50:58.308
and, last but also least, hearts.

50:59.517 --> 51:00.977
Don't forget your card, okay?

51:01.061 --> 51:04.272
I'll do this slow 'cause I know
you Hearts are, a bit slow.

51:08.860 --> 51:11.321
And... boom!

51:11.404 --> 51:15.116
Your card is gone.
But, wait, where'd it go?

51:15.200 --> 51:17.911
Is that a rhetorical question,
or am I supposed to answer it?

51:17.994 --> 51:19.913
Check the box, dummy.

51:23.667 --> 51:26.044
Whoa!

51:26.795 --> 51:28.588
So, how'd I do it?

51:29.297 --> 51:31.591
I don't know. I-I got nothing.

51:31.675 --> 51:33.551
Nothing.

51:33.635 --> 51:36.554
That's all you and the rest
of the Hearts are... nothing.

51:37.180 --> 51:39.766
Trick the Vic. Trick the Vic.

51:39.849 --> 51:42.102
- Trick the Vic. Trick the Vic.
- Hey, Vic.

51:42.185 --> 51:43.436
I know how you do it.

51:44.646 --> 51:46.356
- I got you, buddy.
- Okay.

51:46.439 --> 51:49.651
If you know how I do it, then you do it.

51:49.734 --> 51:52.862
First off, nice card force
to your duplicate.

51:52.946 --> 51:56.032
But I can't do the trick
exactly how you did it

51:56.116 --> 52:00.203
'cause... I don't have double-stick tape.

52:00.286 --> 52:02.539
Nice.

52:02.622 --> 52:04.040
Spoiler alert!

52:06.209 --> 52:07.627
Carry on.

52:07.711 --> 52:09.087
Now, if I was gonna do it,

52:09.170 --> 52:13.008
I would've taken one of the aces,
the ace of hearts,

52:13.091 --> 52:16.094
and I would've turned it into your card.

52:18.430 --> 52:21.224
Or I would've done a visual vanish.

52:21.975 --> 52:23.351
Something like this.

52:27.856 --> 52:30.176
- You teach him that?
- I may have helped out a little bit.

52:30.233 --> 52:31.234
Nice, Theo.

52:31.317 --> 52:33.570
And if I was gonna use a duplicate,

52:33.653 --> 52:37.490
I wouldn't make it appear
somewhere obvious like a card box.

52:37.574 --> 52:40.201
I would make it appear
somewhere really impossible

52:40.285 --> 52:41.828
like your left pants pocket.

52:42.370 --> 52:44.122
What? No way.

52:45.915 --> 52:48.501
Whoa!

52:48.585 --> 52:51.463
But that would've required
something you don't have...

52:52.172 --> 52:53.173
A friend.

52:53.256 --> 52:55.300
Sick burn.

52:55.383 --> 52:58.887
Theo! Theo! Theo!

53:00.722 --> 53:02.557
Hey, what are you doing? Give those back.

53:02.640 --> 53:04.434
Chill out, bud.

53:04.517 --> 53:05.894
That was impressive.

53:05.977 --> 53:08.104
So, let me show you one more trick.

53:09.147 --> 53:12.150
Maybe you can tell me how I do this one.

53:15.904 --> 53:17.572
Whoa!

53:21.034 --> 53:23.244
- Aw.
- No.

53:23.328 --> 53:26.247
No, my cards!
How could you do this to my cards!

53:26.331 --> 53:28.208
- Come on!
- Why would you do that?

53:28.291 --> 53:30.460
- Bring 'em back! No! No!
- Not cool, Vic.

53:30.919 --> 53:33.713
You're all in trouble.
Everybody, back to the bunk.

53:46.768 --> 53:49.854
I've got an extra deck of cards
in the bunk.

53:50.480 --> 53:53.149
You know, they have photos
of my Minecraft avatars on them,

53:53.233 --> 53:56.361
but they're yours if you want 'em.

53:57.487 --> 53:59.614
Thanks, but...

54:01.241 --> 54:02.784
those cards were special.

54:03.326 --> 54:04.828
Why?

54:05.412 --> 54:07.247
My dad gave 'em to me.

54:14.129 --> 54:17.048
He was the first person
to ever show me magic.

54:18.717 --> 54:21.886
My dad, he... He was...

54:24.431 --> 54:28.059
He... He was... He was great.

54:30.228 --> 54:32.939
He... He died.

54:33.023 --> 54:35.900
And I-I-I just...

54:35.984 --> 54:38.278
I really, really miss him.

54:44.451 --> 54:48.621
You know, everyone expects me
to be this great magician.

54:49.581 --> 54:51.416
But I'm not.

54:51.958 --> 54:53.793
And I don't think I really wanna be.

54:55.545 --> 54:57.297
But I'm afraid to tell my dad that.

54:59.007 --> 55:01.760
I say I have 109 known allergies,

55:01.843 --> 55:06.264
but... it's really only 108.

55:06.765 --> 55:09.100
I'm not actually allergic to gluten.

55:09.809 --> 55:13.188
I just can't stand
my mom's beef stroganoff.

55:17.359 --> 55:19.152
Ruth, is there anything you wanna share?

55:21.321 --> 55:24.449
I used to think I was adorable,
like a bunny.

55:25.450 --> 55:28.870
But now I have this thirst for blood,
like a hawk.

55:30.121 --> 55:32.624
You're making your way up the food chain.

55:32.707 --> 55:33.708
Proud of you.

55:33.792 --> 55:37.504
Whoa.
Vera, was that a compliment I just heard?

55:38.838 --> 55:43.009
What I meant was,
every day, I dislike you a little less.

55:45.762 --> 55:48.932
I don't perform private shows
all over the world.

55:49.683 --> 55:51.976
Or anywhere, actually.

55:52.060 --> 55:53.978
Yeah, we kinda figured that.

55:55.480 --> 56:00.694
When I was your age, I performed
because it was the most fun in the world.

56:01.194 --> 56:05.824
I mean, that's all I wanted,
to have my own show and be the guy.

56:07.575 --> 56:10.453
And then something happened...

56:10.537 --> 56:12.080
Darkwood ended your partnership.

56:12.163 --> 56:14.374
- Broke your heart.
- Made you lose your mojo.

56:14.833 --> 56:18.169
What? No. I wouldn't... I wouldn't... Um...

56:18.253 --> 56:20.046
No. That's not...

56:20.130 --> 56:22.340
Well, the point is, guys,
is that after that,

56:22.424 --> 56:25.260
I stopped having fun on stage.

56:26.428 --> 56:29.097
And the audience
stopped having fun watching me.

56:29.681 --> 56:31.433
And now I drive a taxi.

56:31.516 --> 56:33.518
Man. Not even an Uber?

56:33.601 --> 56:35.895
My car's not nice enough.
It didn't qualify.

56:35.979 --> 56:39.232
What about that sweet Challenger
you came in?

56:39.315 --> 56:41.317
That is a rental.

56:41.401 --> 56:42.652
Okay.

56:42.736 --> 56:43.737
- Yeah.
- Okay.

56:43.820 --> 56:46.823
I had to borrow money from my dad
in order to rent it. Yeah.

56:47.699 --> 56:48.700
Um...

56:49.743 --> 56:54.247
It's not a Golden Wand, but it's a start.

56:55.040 --> 56:56.041
Thanks, Theo.

56:57.250 --> 56:59.919
And for my next trick,

57:00.003 --> 57:03.798
I put a spell on all of us
to quit being sad

57:03.882 --> 57:06.593
and have the best night ever.

57:09.054 --> 57:11.890
- Thank you, thank you.
- Hey, Theo, Janelle's looking at you.

57:11.973 --> 57:12.974
Really?

57:13.058 --> 57:16.019
What do you think it's about?
You think she ran out of marshmallows?

57:16.102 --> 57:19.939
She probably ran out of marshmallows.
Hey, Janelle, we have marshmallows!

57:20.023 --> 57:21.358
- Chill out, chill out!
- Why?

57:21.441 --> 57:24.611
Ooh, lady's gonna like you.

57:24.694 --> 57:27.447
- K-I-S-S-I-N-G.
- Theo!

57:27.530 --> 57:31.659
Theo likes Janelle. Theo likes Janelle.

57:40.585 --> 57:43.814
When were you gonna come clean about the
fact that you're a professional magician?

57:43.838 --> 57:44.839
I'm not.

57:45.757 --> 57:48.927
- I saw you with Vic. That was crazy.
- Thanks.

57:49.010 --> 57:51.680
Yeah, you might be onto something
with this whole magic thing.

57:51.763 --> 57:53.181
It's fun, right?

57:54.849 --> 57:56.267
This is fun.

58:03.149 --> 58:04.401
Everyone freeze.

58:07.862 --> 58:09.739
Ruth, what are you doing?

58:09.823 --> 58:10.990
Stay back.

58:11.074 --> 58:13.326
I've been training for this moment
all summer.

58:14.786 --> 58:17.997
Guys, I think that's Fred.
He must've gotten out of his cage.

58:18.081 --> 58:21.167
Thank God.
Fred had his stink glands removed.

58:21.584 --> 58:23.461
But we still need to guide him back.

58:24.629 --> 58:26.506
Don't listen to them.

58:26.589 --> 58:27.966
Don't look at them.

58:28.925 --> 58:31.928
It's just you and me.

58:36.266 --> 58:38.143
Those don't look like Fred's stripes.

58:38.226 --> 58:40.228
No. My mustelid allergy.

58:40.311 --> 58:42.731
Nathan, hold it.
It's not Fred. It's not Fred!

58:56.828 --> 58:59.706
I'm doing this out of love.

59:03.877 --> 59:07.088
Don't worry. I got one for you!

59:08.923 --> 59:10.300
Sker-ploosh!

59:28.234 --> 59:29.361
No! Don't touch me.

59:39.746 --> 59:40.747
Clear.

59:43.958 --> 59:44.958
Shh.

59:50.173 --> 59:52.050
Good morning, campers.

59:52.133 --> 59:53.885
Two days until Top Hat,

59:53.968 --> 59:56.971
and I am so excited
I may actually eat our lunch today,

59:57.055 --> 59:59.224
which will be meat loaf,
as will be dinner.

59:59.307 --> 01:00:02.268
In fact, we're just gonna roll
with meat loaf for the rest of the summer.

01:00:05.188 --> 01:00:07.190
Andy, help!

01:00:08.983 --> 01:00:10.568
They got me too.

01:00:13.071 --> 01:00:15.073
Help!

01:00:17.492 --> 01:00:20.620
Hey, what's going on? Bring those back.

01:00:20.704 --> 01:00:21.705
Coming through.

01:00:21.788 --> 01:00:24.028
They've checked everything out
for the final performance.

01:00:24.416 --> 01:00:28.169
What are you doing with Ethan the hawk?
Ethan Hawk is my whole act.

01:00:28.962 --> 01:00:30.880
You snooze, you lose, little one.

01:00:32.132 --> 01:00:34.718
Where's everything?
They're messing with my things.

01:00:35.802 --> 01:00:37.262
So, what is... My table.

01:00:37.345 --> 01:00:39.639
There's nothing.
There's no balls, no cards.

01:00:40.724 --> 01:00:43.309
- The Diamonds checked out all the props.
- What?

01:00:44.269 --> 01:00:45.645
- I don't believe this.
- What?

01:00:47.647 --> 01:00:50.442
- They shrunk our hearts.
- How'd that happen?

01:00:50.525 --> 01:00:52.861
They switched the dryer setting
to "heavy duty."

01:00:52.944 --> 01:00:54.904
Polyblend athletic wear
is not "heavy duty."

01:00:54.988 --> 01:00:57.049
Do you think maybe
you just put it on the wrong setting?

01:00:57.073 --> 01:00:59.176
Are you... Are you accusing me
of making a laundry mistake?

01:00:59.200 --> 01:01:03.455
I do not make laundry mistakes, sir.
I make laundry miracles.

01:01:03.538 --> 01:01:05.081
The Diamonds have ruined our act.

01:01:05.165 --> 01:01:06.875
We still have the counting wheel.

01:01:09.794 --> 01:01:11.129
They ruined everything!

01:01:11.212 --> 01:01:14.174
You were right about Darkwood.
She is cold-blooded.

01:01:14.257 --> 01:01:17.052
We'll never get new stuff together
in time for the final performance.

01:01:17.135 --> 01:01:20.555
Face it, guys, it's over. They beat us.

01:01:20.638 --> 01:01:22.533
It's not like
we ever really had a chance anyway.

01:01:22.557 --> 01:01:26.728
That's not true. Remember how horrible
you guys were when you first got here?

01:01:26.811 --> 01:01:28.688
You guys suck way less now.

01:01:28.772 --> 01:01:31.399
- Thanks a lot.
- Was that supposed to be a compliment?

01:01:31.483 --> 01:01:33.151
Seriously, we can't quit.

01:01:33.234 --> 01:01:36.112
'Cause when the going gets hard,
the Hearts get going.

01:01:36.196 --> 01:01:38.365
That was pretty good.
You just came up with that?

01:01:38.448 --> 01:01:40.950
- That was good, wasn't it?
- Yeah. That was awesome.

01:01:41.034 --> 01:01:44.204
You know what?
I think I know what we need.

01:01:44.287 --> 01:01:45.705
Follow me.

01:01:53.129 --> 01:01:54.839
Okay, gang.

01:01:54.923 --> 01:01:58.426
And here we are.

01:01:59.135 --> 01:02:00.428
Okay.

01:02:05.600 --> 01:02:07.018
Whoa!

01:02:07.102 --> 01:02:09.437
How'd you do that? Magnets or wires?

01:02:09.521 --> 01:02:11.981
Neither. Just modern technology.

01:02:12.065 --> 01:02:13.692
So, what are we doing here?

01:02:13.775 --> 01:02:15.902
One night,
I was playing a show in Kansas City,

01:02:15.985 --> 01:02:18.154
and the airline put my prop case
on the wrong plane.

01:02:18.238 --> 01:02:19.364
Ooh, not good.

01:02:19.447 --> 01:02:23.702
I had to improvise with whatever I could
find at the airport convenience store.

01:02:23.785 --> 01:02:26.538
And that is exactly what I'm challenging
you guys to do right now.

01:02:26.621 --> 01:02:28.248
Who says we need props?

01:02:28.331 --> 01:02:30.750
Magicians create the trick,
not the other way around.

01:02:30.834 --> 01:02:33.294
Think of it as like
a magical treasure hunt.

01:02:33.378 --> 01:02:35.922
Um, typically in a treasure hunt,
the participants are provided

01:02:36.006 --> 01:02:37.424
with clues, a map, or a legend...

01:02:37.507 --> 01:02:39.944
- Let's go. See you in 30 minutes.
- Are we gonna get clues or a map?

01:02:39.968 --> 01:02:43.054
Have fun. Figure it out, all right?
Improvise.

01:03:01.114 --> 01:03:02.615
Maybe this one.

01:03:04.325 --> 01:03:06.661
This is garbage.
This is just not the shape.

01:03:07.996 --> 01:03:09.998
That.

01:03:17.839 --> 01:03:19.174
Nathan, Nathan.

01:03:21.926 --> 01:03:24.596
Excuse me, everybody.
Can I get your attention?

01:03:24.679 --> 01:03:26.890
Today, we're gonna show you some magic.

01:03:27.474 --> 01:03:29.017
Take it away, Vera.

01:03:36.483 --> 01:03:37.484
So cool.

01:03:42.530 --> 01:03:43.531
- Got it?
- Yeah.

01:03:43.615 --> 01:03:44.616
Cool.

01:03:46.826 --> 01:03:48.995
Excuse me, how accurate is that scale?

01:03:49.079 --> 01:03:51.790
Measures weight
down to a thousandth of a pound.

01:03:52.165 --> 01:03:55.418
If he can guess the exact weight,
can we have this candy for free?

01:03:55.794 --> 01:03:57.796
Sure. That's impossible.

01:03:57.879 --> 01:04:02.092
Is it impossible, or is it 2.173 pounds?

01:04:03.134 --> 01:04:05.720
2.173 pounds.

01:04:05.804 --> 01:04:07.555
- Yeah!
- That's incredible.

01:04:07.639 --> 01:04:12.185
Cool, dude.
We just saved $11.54, tax included.

01:04:12.268 --> 01:04:13.645
Whoo!

01:04:13.728 --> 01:04:15.480
I'm trying to learn
to hold the ball right.

01:04:15.563 --> 01:04:17.774
What's up with
all these weird magic kids?

01:04:17.857 --> 01:04:19.526
Bunch of lame-os.

01:04:19.609 --> 01:04:23.113
Hey! Those are my friends
you're talking about.

01:04:23.196 --> 01:04:26.032
And weird is what makes us awesome.

01:04:26.116 --> 01:04:28.743
Attack! Go for their eyes.

01:04:28.827 --> 01:04:31.621
Go, go!

01:04:35.667 --> 01:04:37.335
Am I ever going to touch a bunny?

01:04:37.419 --> 01:04:39.879
One day, I promise you will.

01:04:40.380 --> 01:04:43.758
Didn't only a dozen escape?
Now they're everywhere.

01:04:43.842 --> 01:04:45.552
How are they multiplying?

01:04:47.262 --> 01:04:50.098
You know, I'm gonna let your parents
explain that one.

01:04:52.892 --> 01:04:57.022
Okay, way past your curfew.
Get in there and get to bed.

01:04:57.105 --> 01:04:59.232
Where are you going?

01:04:59.315 --> 01:05:01.252
- I've got a score to settle.
- I promise you he'll show.

01:05:01.276 --> 01:05:03.069
Hey, Darkwood!

01:05:03.153 --> 01:05:05.131
There he is right now.
All right. I'll talk to you later.

01:05:05.155 --> 01:05:06.823
Get off the phone, you monster.

01:05:07.699 --> 01:05:09.701
Did you just call me a monster?

01:05:09.784 --> 01:05:13.455
It's one thing to sabotage me
and my career, but children?

01:05:13.538 --> 01:05:15.790
Were you really cool
with this whole sign-out thing?

01:05:15.874 --> 01:05:20.337
Seriously? I already punished my bunk
and made them return all the props.

01:05:20.420 --> 01:05:21.504
But what's up with you?

01:05:21.588 --> 01:05:24.382
You know, when I first heard
you were coming this summer,

01:05:24.466 --> 01:05:26.176
I was excited to see you.

01:05:26.259 --> 01:05:28.511
I thought we'd be past
whatever beef we had

01:05:28.595 --> 01:05:32.223
and we could just be... friends again.

01:05:32.307 --> 01:05:35.226
That is so easy for you to say.

01:05:35.310 --> 01:05:38.813
I got nothing and you got everything
when you dropped me.

01:05:38.897 --> 01:05:39.939
I dropped you?

01:05:40.023 --> 01:05:42.817
- You cheated on me.
- I never cheated on you.

01:05:42.901 --> 01:05:44.444
You cheated on our act.

01:05:45.153 --> 01:05:49.949
'Kay. Yes, fine, I'll admit it.
I took that TV meeting behind your back.

01:05:50.033 --> 01:05:52.744
You were always calling me your protÃ©gÃ©e.

01:05:52.827 --> 01:05:54.621
I wanted to see
if I could do it on my own.

01:05:54.704 --> 01:05:57.540
Your treachery is finally revealed.

01:05:57.624 --> 01:06:01.169
Yes. They thought I would be
a better solo act on TV.

01:06:01.252 --> 01:06:03.296
And they hated the name Abraca-Duo.

01:06:03.380 --> 01:06:04.547
It was catchy at the time!

01:06:04.631 --> 01:06:06.341
- But I told them no.
- Exactly!

01:06:06.424 --> 01:06:07.842
What?

01:06:08.426 --> 01:06:10.970
I told them I wasn't a solo act.

01:06:11.054 --> 01:06:13.431
I was trying to negotiate a deal
for the both of us,

01:06:13.515 --> 01:06:15.767
but you quit before I could explain.

01:06:18.186 --> 01:06:20.814
- Why... Why didn't you stop me?
- 'Cause you were flipping out.

01:06:20.897 --> 01:06:23.066
You wouldn't return
any of my phone calls or texts.

01:06:23.149 --> 01:06:26.027
You were too busy bad-mouthing me
to any magician that would listen.

01:06:26.111 --> 01:06:27.904
So I did the act alone.

01:06:27.987 --> 01:06:30.740
I was terrified to do it without you.

01:06:32.117 --> 01:06:34.202
- That is crazy.
- Why?

01:06:34.911 --> 01:06:37.205
You know why that TV booker
picked you in the first place?

01:06:37.288 --> 01:06:39.374
Because, I mean, look at you.

01:06:39.833 --> 01:06:42.043
You were destined to be a star.

01:06:42.127 --> 01:06:45.130
I knew it, he knew it, everyone knew it.

01:06:45.213 --> 01:06:49.884
And... evidently
I was destined to drive a cab.

01:06:50.510 --> 01:06:52.012
Man. Not even an Uber?

01:06:52.095 --> 01:06:54.180
I am pouring my heart out here.

01:06:54.264 --> 01:06:55.807
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

01:06:55.890 --> 01:06:59.769
Andy, you are one of the best magicians
I have ever seen.

01:06:59.853 --> 01:07:01.021
Yes, that is true.

01:07:01.104 --> 01:07:04.107
I learned almost everything I know
from you and Preston.

01:07:05.191 --> 01:07:07.318
And watching you work
with your bunk this summer

01:07:07.402 --> 01:07:09.446
reminded me how awesome you are.

01:07:09.821 --> 01:07:10.905
You're welcome.

01:07:10.989 --> 01:07:14.242
Stop being a jerk, or I am not going
to tell you who I was on the phone with.

01:07:14.325 --> 01:07:15.765
Why? Who were you on the phone with?

01:07:15.827 --> 01:07:18.788
Well, my friend runs Treasure Island,

01:07:18.872 --> 01:07:22.500
and he just had a last-minute cancellation
for a matinee performance tomorrow

01:07:22.584 --> 01:07:25.587
and asked me if I knew anybody
who was ready to work that stage.

01:07:25.670 --> 01:07:27.964
And I recommended you.

01:07:30.342 --> 01:07:34.054
I don't know what to... A matinee?
Really? Not even an evening show?

01:07:34.137 --> 01:07:36.264
Seriously? Do you want the gig or not?

01:07:37.349 --> 01:07:38.600
- Hey.
- Don't speak.

01:07:39.684 --> 01:07:41.186
Don't say a word.

01:07:41.770 --> 01:07:42.896
Hold on.

01:07:42.979 --> 01:07:45.607
They've offered you a show
at Treasure Island.

01:07:45.690 --> 01:07:48.193
- Darkwood texted you already?
- About an hour ago.

01:07:48.276 --> 01:07:52.155
Congratulations. That is... It's huge.

01:07:52.739 --> 01:07:53.948
I know, right?

01:07:55.200 --> 01:07:57.035
You don't seem very happy.

01:07:57.535 --> 01:08:01.081
Well, if I take the gig,
I'll be back in time for the show,

01:08:01.164 --> 01:08:04.959
but I won't be here tomorrow
to help the bunk put their acts together,

01:08:05.043 --> 01:08:07.921
and... I mean, trust me,
those screw-ups, they need me.

01:08:08.004 --> 01:08:09.089
What do you need?

01:08:09.172 --> 01:08:12.509
You've been dreaming about this moment
your whole life, haven't you?

01:08:14.552 --> 01:08:15.553
I think so.

01:08:15.637 --> 01:08:18.932
I can't tell you what to do,
but I know that deep down,

01:08:19.683 --> 01:08:21.184
you already have the answer.

01:08:21.267 --> 01:08:23.412
What about the bunk?
I can't leave without saying goodbye.

01:08:23.435 --> 01:08:27.232
Let 'em sleep, all right? Go.
I'll explain to them in the morning.

01:08:27.314 --> 01:08:29.149
- Go.
- Okay.

01:08:49.462 --> 01:08:51.089
Good morning, campers.

01:08:51.171 --> 01:08:53.508
Today is the day
we've all been waiting for.

01:08:53.591 --> 01:08:56.344
Today your parents will see
all that you've worked on this summer.

01:08:56.428 --> 01:09:00.598
Lunch will be lobster thermidor
with a porcini and crÃ¨me fraÃ®che risotto.

01:09:01.099 --> 01:09:03.852
Feel free to mention today's meal
to your parents.

01:09:04.894 --> 01:09:07.354
It doesn't look like
he even slept here last night.

01:09:07.439 --> 01:09:10.649
- Yeah, and his trash bags are gone.
- It's like he vanished.

01:09:10.734 --> 01:09:12.234
And I have appeared.

01:09:12.318 --> 01:09:14.988
All right, bunk meeting, five minutes.
Come on.

01:09:16.031 --> 01:09:17.365
Get dressed. Let's go.

01:09:17.448 --> 01:09:19.158
- What? Seriously?
- Excuse me?

01:09:19.242 --> 01:09:21.745
- He went to Vegas?
- Yes, he went to Vegas.

01:09:21.828 --> 01:09:25.665
He's been given the chance to perform.
That's what magicians do.

01:09:25.749 --> 01:09:28.042
That's what you're gonna be doing tonight.

01:09:28.126 --> 01:09:31.254
And he will be back in time
to watch you compete.

01:09:31.337 --> 01:09:34.381
How are we supposed to compete?
I mean, we can't do it without him.

01:09:34.466 --> 01:09:36.343
He was gonna help us
put our acts together.

01:09:36.426 --> 01:09:38.345
- Right.
- But now I'm here.

01:09:38.428 --> 01:09:41.096
And I will help you put your act together.
All right?

01:09:41.180 --> 01:09:43.350
So, let's just roll up our sleeves

01:09:43.433 --> 01:09:45.100
and get to work.

01:09:45.185 --> 01:09:47.979
Don't touch Sammy.
He was a little bitey this morning.

01:09:49.229 --> 01:09:52.567
Here we go.
This is the card that she will choose.

01:09:52.649 --> 01:09:55.070
She's gonna pick this card.
It's a guarantee.

01:09:55.153 --> 01:09:57.447
You see that? 'Kay.

01:09:57.530 --> 01:10:00.658
Now, I'm gonna tuck it away
for safekeeping.

01:10:00.742 --> 01:10:01.993
Put it right there.

01:10:02.077 --> 01:10:08.249
Now I'm gonna take a completely
different deck of cards, right here.

01:10:08.333 --> 01:10:10.877
And she can choose any one of these cards.

01:10:10.960 --> 01:10:11.961
Absolutely.

01:10:12.045 --> 01:10:15.465
Go ahead and just touch
the back of one, okay?

01:10:15.548 --> 01:10:17.634
Are we laughing
because she has so many choices?

01:10:17.717 --> 01:10:19.761
Is that what we're laughing about?

01:10:19.844 --> 01:10:22.555
- This one.
- That card. Are you sure?

01:10:22.639 --> 01:10:24.766
So, this is the card. 'Kay?

01:10:24.849 --> 01:10:28.103
And I have a sneaking suspicion
we're not gonna forget this one, okay?

01:10:28.186 --> 01:10:31.314
Here's your card. Now, go ahead
and place it towards your chest.

01:10:31.398 --> 01:10:33.692
Right there, right on your heart.
Don't look.

01:10:33.900 --> 01:10:36.236
All right, now take a little peeksy.

01:10:36.945 --> 01:10:39.906
Tell the audience,
is it a red card or a black card?

01:10:39.989 --> 01:10:41.282
It's red.

01:10:42.325 --> 01:10:45.078
Yeah, not the back of the card.

01:10:45.161 --> 01:10:48.581
We're talking about the face of the card.
The actual card.

01:10:48.665 --> 01:10:51.251
What color's that?

01:10:51.334 --> 01:10:53.670
It's red.

01:10:53.753 --> 01:10:55.213
Can I see that?

01:10:58.049 --> 01:10:59.551
Ooh!

01:10:59.634 --> 01:11:02.637
Yes, that is a red five of diamonds.

01:11:02.721 --> 01:11:05.557
And... this is really awkward

01:11:05.640 --> 01:11:08.810
for anyone in here
who thought I messed up.

01:11:15.025 --> 01:11:18.028
Give it up for Haley, everybody. Haley!

01:11:18.945 --> 01:11:20.363
Thank you.

01:11:25.702 --> 01:11:29.080
Darkwood was right about you.
She said you'd be a good matinee magician.

01:11:29.748 --> 01:11:32.208
She said that?
That is actually a little insulting.

01:11:32.292 --> 01:11:34.169
But that you'd be even better
in prime time.

01:11:34.252 --> 01:11:36.254
How'd you like a showcase tonight?

01:11:37.922 --> 01:11:39.758
Tonight? Tonight-tonight?

01:11:40.717 --> 01:11:44.387
Actually,
tonight is a little complicated.

01:11:44.471 --> 01:11:46.348
Let me make this simple for you.

01:11:46.431 --> 01:11:49.809
There's a million magicians who would kill
for an eight o'clock show on the strip,

01:11:49.893 --> 01:11:51.186
and I'm offering you one.

01:11:51.269 --> 01:11:55.398
You do well tonight, this theater
could be your home for a very long time.

01:11:55.482 --> 01:11:56.816
What do you say?

01:11:58.610 --> 01:11:59.611
Let's do it. Yes.

01:11:59.694 --> 01:12:02.238
Excellent. Unpack your things,
make yourself at home.

01:12:02.322 --> 01:12:03.323
Great.

01:12:28.390 --> 01:12:32.227
I have a silkworm that not only
makes silk, she also makes wood!

01:12:32.310 --> 01:12:33.895
Whoa!

01:12:33.978 --> 01:12:36.439
The name is Kornelius Kessler.
Here's my card.

01:12:36.523 --> 01:12:38.858
If you liked what you saw,
review me on Yelp.

01:12:38.942 --> 01:12:40.318
My son is performing today.

01:12:40.402 --> 01:12:43.405
When you see the velvet bow tie,
you know you're getting a quality act.

01:12:44.906 --> 01:12:47.367
- What about the bow tie?
- I've got it right here.

01:12:50.954 --> 01:12:52.372
It's so nice to meet you.

01:12:57.293 --> 01:13:00.463
Excuse me. Hi. Is this one taken? Thanks.

01:13:00.547 --> 01:13:03.216
Okay, Hearts, gather up.
Hey, guys, come here.

01:13:03.299 --> 01:13:07.095
All right, um, we have to have
a little heart-to-Hearts.

01:13:07.178 --> 01:13:09.264
- What's going on?
- Well, Andy called

01:13:09.347 --> 01:13:10.724
and, unfortunately,

01:13:10.807 --> 01:13:15.562
he is not going to be able to make it back
in time for the Top Hat after all.

01:13:15.645 --> 01:13:18.023
But he wanted me to tell you
how very, very proud he is

01:13:18.106 --> 01:13:19.983
of each and every one of you.

01:13:20.066 --> 01:13:22.110
And, of course, so am I.

01:13:22.193 --> 01:13:23.653
What are we supposed to do?

01:13:27.157 --> 01:13:30.410
When the going gets hard,
the Hearts get going.

01:13:30.493 --> 01:13:31.911
Let's do this thing.

01:13:31.995 --> 01:13:34.748
Let's do this thing. That's the spirit.

01:13:34.831 --> 01:13:37.292
Theo, Andy specifically...

01:13:38.293 --> 01:13:40.628
Well, where'd... he go?

01:13:40.712 --> 01:13:42.881
Preston, you're on.

01:13:42.964 --> 01:13:45.175
Okay. Places, all right? Good luck.

01:13:45.508 --> 01:13:48.511
Since the dawn of time,
we have marveled at the feats

01:13:48.595 --> 01:13:51.890
performed by the select few
who dare peer into the beyond.

01:13:52.974 --> 01:13:53.975
Magicians.

01:13:57.604 --> 01:13:59.356
Welcome, welcome.

01:13:59.439 --> 01:14:01.608
Now, this summer,
every single one of your children

01:14:01.691 --> 01:14:04.361
have earned their place
in this mystical order.

01:14:04.444 --> 01:14:06.279
But who among them has learned the most?

01:14:06.363 --> 01:14:12.202
And which ones are destined
to hold the Top Hat and the Golden Wand?

01:14:13.912 --> 01:14:17.916
All right.
Be prepared to be shocked and astounded,

01:14:17.999 --> 01:14:21.378
because this year's competition
begins now.

01:14:21.461 --> 01:14:26.383
First up, representing
the Hearts cabin, Ruth Brusselbach.

01:15:08.174 --> 01:15:09.968
- Touch the bunny!
- You can do it, Ruth!

01:15:10.051 --> 01:15:13.805
You can do it. Come on.
Bunny love is real! You're a samurai.

01:15:23.982 --> 01:15:29.112
Next up, representing
the Diamond cabin, Vic d'Antonio.

01:15:35.785 --> 01:15:39.873
Hey, I'm the Vic, and I apologize
to all you parents in advance

01:15:39.956 --> 01:15:42.959
'cause I'm about to win
the Golden Wand, again.

01:15:43.918 --> 01:15:47.672
Now pick a card, any card. Just touch it.

01:15:48.131 --> 01:15:49.132
Okay.

01:15:50.467 --> 01:15:52.635
Memorize it. Don't forget it.

01:15:54.095 --> 01:15:56.097
I'll hand the deck to my assistant.

01:15:59.642 --> 01:16:05.732
Her job's easy. Now watch this.

01:16:14.324 --> 01:16:15.700
Was this your card?

01:16:26.336 --> 01:16:27.879
How'd you know I was in here?

01:16:28.380 --> 01:16:30.382
You know there's a magic show
going on right now?

01:16:30.465 --> 01:16:32.592
I'm not performing if Andy's not here.

01:16:32.676 --> 01:16:35.053
Your family's out there. And your mom.

01:16:35.136 --> 01:16:38.306
Don't you want your mom to see
all the magic you've learned this summer?

01:16:38.390 --> 01:16:42.060
She doesn't care about magic.
She didn't even know about this place.

01:16:42.143 --> 01:16:45.105
She thought it was called Magic Camp.
Can you believe that?

01:16:45.188 --> 01:16:46.188
Um, sort of.

01:16:46.231 --> 01:16:48.817
Magic was my thing with my dad.

01:16:48.900 --> 01:16:51.111
I'm here because he applied for me.

01:16:51.778 --> 01:16:56.116
And... now he's gone.
So, what's the point?

01:16:56.199 --> 01:16:57.826
Interesting you should say that.

01:16:57.909 --> 01:17:00.662
Next up from the Hearts, Vera Costa.

01:17:29.482 --> 01:17:32.027
I keep all my applications on file.

01:17:32.110 --> 01:17:35.030
And... I remember yours, of course.

01:17:40.368 --> 01:17:41.369
Hold on.

01:17:41.953 --> 01:17:44.664
'Cause that's me. I'm the jack of hearts.

01:17:44.748 --> 01:17:48.960
And that's you. You're the king of hearts.

01:17:49.044 --> 01:17:50.128
Wait, who shot this?

01:17:50.211 --> 01:17:52.047
That's incredible.
You're incredible, Theo.

01:17:53.798 --> 01:17:56.301
Wow. Did you just see that trick?

01:17:56.384 --> 01:17:59.095
My son is an amazing magician.

01:17:59.179 --> 01:18:00.805
I don't know how he does any of it.

01:18:01.890 --> 01:18:05.727
But what you might not see
is how much he has overcome.

01:18:06.686 --> 01:18:07.687
How much...

01:18:10.982 --> 01:18:13.610
I wish Theo could see everything
that I see in him.

01:18:14.694 --> 01:18:16.529
But he keeps it all locked inside,

01:18:16.613 --> 01:18:19.991
and magic is the first thing
that's unlocked him.

01:18:20.408 --> 01:18:22.118
I guess that's sort of a trick, right?

01:18:22.619 --> 01:18:26.498
That's why you'd be crazy
not to take him for your magic camp,

01:18:26.581 --> 01:18:29.000
or institute, or whatever.

01:18:32.837 --> 01:18:35.882
Well, I may be eccentric,

01:18:35.965 --> 01:18:41.179
but, I don't think I've ever been
more persuaded by an application.

01:18:42.681 --> 01:18:46.518
Theo, I cannot tell you what to do,

01:18:46.601 --> 01:18:50.397
but I know deep down
you already have the answer.

01:18:51.648 --> 01:18:53.692
But I can't go up there alone.

01:18:53.775 --> 01:18:55.568
Andy said you would say that.

01:18:55.652 --> 01:19:00.448
But he told me to tell you
that if you lose your way on stage,

01:19:00.532 --> 01:19:02.492
just look to the wings

01:19:02.575 --> 01:19:06.079
and you'll find a true magician
to help you.

01:19:06.162 --> 01:19:07.664
What does that mean?

01:19:08.164 --> 01:19:09.457
Only one way to find out.

01:19:11.459 --> 01:19:13.378
Okay, I'll need a little help here.

01:19:13.878 --> 01:19:16.506
Young gent,
what is your locker combination at school?

01:19:17.424 --> 01:19:20.468
Don't worry, I'm not gonna
steal your homework, or do it for you.

01:19:20.552 --> 01:19:23.805
Sixteen, 98, 17.

01:19:23.888 --> 01:19:25.140
Great, okay.

01:19:25.223 --> 01:19:28.309
Ma'am, type in 1-6-9-8-1-7.

01:19:28.393 --> 01:19:30.061
And then hit times.

01:19:30.145 --> 01:19:33.273
Okay, um, you, sir, what is your birthday?
You.

01:19:33.815 --> 01:19:34.816
October 9.

01:19:34.899 --> 01:19:36.693
October 9? 10-9, great.

01:19:36.776 --> 01:19:40.071
Ma'am, type in 1-0-9. Then hit times.

01:19:40.155 --> 01:19:44.367
Don't say this out loud, but type in the
age you were when you had your first kiss.

01:19:47.912 --> 01:19:51.958
Now, hit equals and read the number
aloud to me one digit at a time.

01:19:52.417 --> 01:19:54.044
- Seven.
- Seven.

01:19:54.127 --> 01:19:55.670
- Four.
- Four.

01:19:55.754 --> 01:19:57.589
- Zero.
- Zero.

01:19:57.672 --> 01:19:59.341
- Four.
- Four.

01:19:59.424 --> 01:20:02.010
- Zero, two.
- Two.

01:20:02.469 --> 01:20:03.553
One, two.

01:20:03.636 --> 01:20:04.804
One, two.

01:20:04.888 --> 01:20:06.681
Sorry for my messy handwriting.

01:20:06.765 --> 01:20:09.851
So, 74,040,212.

01:20:09.934 --> 01:20:13.938
Okay, so there's no possible way
I could've known any of the information

01:20:14.022 --> 01:20:15.462
that you were gonna give me tonight.

01:20:15.523 --> 01:20:18.735
Yet, we used your numbers
to create this huge number.

01:20:18.818 --> 01:20:23.490
Now, I would like to call your attention
to this envelope of mystery.

01:20:23.573 --> 01:20:26.534
Earlier today,
I put my prediction inside this envelope.

01:20:26.618 --> 01:20:29.537
And now I am going to reveal it to you.

01:20:32.582 --> 01:20:35.418
Elephant. Amazing, right?

01:20:38.505 --> 01:20:40.965
I see you're confused. It's upside down.

01:20:42.634 --> 01:20:45.220
- Ho!
- "Elephant."

01:20:46.137 --> 01:20:47.138
My...

01:20:51.351 --> 01:20:53.103
I'm a mathemagician.

01:20:54.104 --> 01:20:58.858
And finally, performing for the Diamonds,
Janelle Santos.

01:21:13.331 --> 01:21:14.332
Janelle.

01:21:47.032 --> 01:21:48.033
Ready?

01:21:48.783 --> 01:21:50.827
One, two...

01:21:50.910 --> 01:21:52.078
Three.

01:22:04.424 --> 01:22:06.551
- My... Wow.
- Whoo!

01:22:16.728 --> 01:22:18.480
This is the best year yet.

01:22:21.066 --> 01:22:24.611
All right, while the judges
are tabulating the results,

01:22:24.694 --> 01:22:27.864
I would like to say thank you
by singing a song.

01:22:29.074 --> 01:22:30.575
Um...

01:22:30.658 --> 01:22:31.659
Excuse me.

01:22:34.704 --> 01:22:41.169
Okay. For our final, final performance,
may I present Theo Moses.

01:22:44.339 --> 01:22:45.590
- Whoo!
- Whoo!

01:22:51.638 --> 01:22:54.265
There are a lot more of you
than I expected.

01:23:16.788 --> 01:23:19.582
You know what? Let me just...

01:23:23.503 --> 01:23:25.505
Magic is all about perception...

01:23:26.297 --> 01:23:29.634
What you're seeing
versus what's really happening.

01:23:30.135 --> 01:23:31.469
Like right now.

01:23:31.553 --> 01:23:33.680
You don't see a deck of cards in my hands,

01:23:33.763 --> 01:23:37.475
but... now you do.

01:23:39.394 --> 01:23:41.688
I'm going to need an assistant
for this trick.

01:23:42.272 --> 01:23:44.983
Mom, can you please come up here
and help me out?

01:23:47.318 --> 01:23:49.654
Wow. He's really owning it out there.

01:23:50.655 --> 01:23:51.740
As you knew he would.

01:23:51.823 --> 01:23:54.510
Can you just look through these
just to make sure they're all different?

01:23:54.534 --> 01:23:55.994
Have the others seen me?

01:23:56.077 --> 01:23:58.788
- Looks good to me.
- No, no, they have no idea you're here.

01:23:58.872 --> 01:24:01.166
Fifty-two cards in the deck,

01:24:01.249 --> 01:24:03.668
but each one
has a different story to tell.

01:24:04.544 --> 01:24:07.672
I knew they could do it on their own.
Now they know it too.

01:24:07.756 --> 01:24:09.341
You planned everything perfectly.

01:24:09.758 --> 01:24:11.801
No, I think you did.

01:24:13.219 --> 01:24:15.305
Me?

01:24:15.388 --> 01:24:20.101
The joker is a bit of a wild card,
just like my little brother, Cameron.

01:24:20.810 --> 01:24:23.855
He annoys me sometimes,
but I'd be lost without him.

01:24:24.522 --> 01:24:26.362
In fact, Cameron,
why don't you come over here.

01:24:26.399 --> 01:24:28.568
On the drive back from Vegas,
I put it together.

01:24:28.651 --> 01:24:32.280
This whole summer,
the newbie bunk, Darkwood, Theo.

01:24:32.364 --> 01:24:34.991
Feel free to come closer
if you want a better look.

01:24:35.658 --> 01:24:38.286
It's one long trick
to help me get my life together.

01:24:38.370 --> 01:24:40.163
Well, you know what they say.

01:24:40.246 --> 01:24:42.957
The trick you don't believe is a trick
is the best trick of all.

01:24:43.416 --> 01:24:46.461
The way to create more magic in the world

01:24:46.544 --> 01:24:48.797
is not by creating more magic.

01:24:48.880 --> 01:24:50.650
- Exactly.
- Yeah, I still don't get that one.

01:24:50.674 --> 01:24:52.133
You didn't let me finish.

01:24:52.217 --> 01:24:55.095
It's by creating magicians.

01:24:55.762 --> 01:25:00.141
This card is me, the jack of hearts.

01:25:01.476 --> 01:25:03.687
You are good, old man.

01:25:03.770 --> 01:25:06.147
And this card is my dad...

01:25:08.066 --> 01:25:09.067
the king of hearts.

01:25:10.026 --> 01:25:12.821
I think about this card every day.

01:25:14.906 --> 01:25:17.909
Now, my mom's card is the queen of hearts.

01:25:18.493 --> 01:25:20.954
But where is she?

01:25:21.746 --> 01:25:23.581
I'll tell you a secret.

01:25:23.665 --> 01:25:26.793
Sometimes I forgot
that this card believed in me.

01:25:27.627 --> 01:25:30.839
But even when I didn't realize it,

01:25:30.922 --> 01:25:33.299
the queen of hearts
was always there for me.

01:25:37.804 --> 01:25:40.598
The queen of hearts. So happy I found it.

01:25:42.434 --> 01:25:46.938
Out of all the cards in the deck,
these four are closest to my heart.

01:25:47.439 --> 01:25:50.525
But there's something extra special
about my mom.

01:25:51.067 --> 01:25:53.528
She changes everything she touches.

01:25:54.529 --> 01:25:58.199
Mom, can you just touch a card for me?

01:26:03.329 --> 01:26:05.040
What?

01:26:05.123 --> 01:26:08.418
That's weird.
Um, Mom, can you just touch another?

01:26:14.507 --> 01:26:15.633
This is strange.

01:26:15.717 --> 01:26:18.678
There's only supposed to be
one queen of hearts in the deck.

01:26:19.095 --> 01:26:21.473
Okay, Mom, just hold your hand out for me.

01:26:35.779 --> 01:26:40.325
I don't know how she does it,
or why it took me this long to realize it,

01:26:40.408 --> 01:26:46.039
but... my mother is magic.

01:26:46.122 --> 01:26:49.918
Aw.

01:27:03.682 --> 01:27:06.518
Yes, yes! What a competition.

01:27:06.601 --> 01:27:08.687
Beautiful. All right.

01:27:08.770 --> 01:27:15.402
And now, the winner of this year's
Top Hat competition is...

01:27:17.654 --> 01:27:19.072
Thank you so much for coming.

01:27:19.155 --> 01:27:21.825
Come on, get a sense of humor.
Here we go.

01:27:21.908 --> 01:27:24.369
All right.

01:27:24.452 --> 01:27:29.082
And the winner
for the Top Hat this year...

01:27:30.083 --> 01:27:32.794
the Hearts.

01:27:32.877 --> 01:27:34.796
We won! We won!

01:27:35.839 --> 01:27:37.340
- Andy?
- It's Andy.

01:27:38.091 --> 01:27:41.469
I'm so proud of you guys.
I saw the whole thing, buddy.

01:27:41.553 --> 01:27:43.054
- Yes!
- Okay. Very good.

01:27:43.847 --> 01:27:45.348
And now for the...

01:27:46.182 --> 01:27:47.976
Now for the...

01:27:48.518 --> 01:27:51.187
The winner of the Golden Wand,

01:27:51.271 --> 01:27:54.190
from the Diamonds, Janelle Santos.

01:27:54.774 --> 01:27:56.192
Get up here.

01:27:57.402 --> 01:27:59.654
Go. Take a bow.

01:28:06.953 --> 01:28:09.372
- What?
- Kristina, I did it! I did it!

01:28:10.081 --> 01:28:11.624
I am so proud of you.

01:28:11.708 --> 01:28:14.544
What are you doing here?
What happened to your big show?

01:28:14.627 --> 01:28:15.837
I skipped it.

01:28:15.920 --> 01:28:18.256
And, dude, I saw your whole set.

01:28:19.466 --> 01:28:23.178
What? I hate to say this phrase
because I hate this phrase,

01:28:23.261 --> 01:28:25.847
but my mind was literally blown.

01:28:25.930 --> 01:28:28.099
Wait. You put that mirror there.

01:28:28.183 --> 01:28:31.227
You know, sometimes it takes somebody else
to help you see yourself.

01:28:31.978 --> 01:28:35.732
Wow.
You just sounded exactly like Preston.

01:28:36.399 --> 01:28:37.650
- I did, didn't I?
- Yeah.

01:28:37.734 --> 01:28:38.735
Okay, we'll work on that.

01:28:38.818 --> 01:28:40.153
Can you clap twice for me?

01:28:41.363 --> 01:28:43.198
Can you stomp your feet?

01:28:43.281 --> 01:28:44.657
Break it down.

01:28:49.204 --> 01:28:50.705
Whoo!

01:28:57.796 --> 01:28:59.631
Thank you. Your bunk killed it.

01:28:59.714 --> 01:29:01.234
- Thanks so much for everything.
- Bye.

01:29:01.299 --> 01:29:05.929
Hey. I am so sorry about ditching
the Treasure Island show.

01:29:06.721 --> 01:29:08.282
I didn't get you in too much trouble,
did I?

01:29:08.306 --> 01:29:09.766
No, it's fine.

01:29:09.849 --> 01:29:11.726
They actually invited you back
next weekend.

01:29:12.352 --> 01:29:13.853
- Really?
- No.

01:29:13.937 --> 01:29:15.689
They banned you for life.

01:29:15.772 --> 01:29:18.566
Andy, that was a really big gig.

01:29:18.650 --> 01:29:21.861
Well, luckily,
I landed an even bigger one.

01:29:22.404 --> 01:29:24.447
- You did? Where?
- Right here.

01:29:25.073 --> 01:29:28.702
You are looking at the new director
of youth talent development.

01:29:29.828 --> 01:29:32.163
Preston offered me a year-round gig
scouting for kids.

01:29:32.664 --> 01:29:34.666
- That's great.
- This is where I wanna be.

01:29:34.749 --> 01:29:40.505
And the craziest part is, is I realized
that when I was on stage in Vegas.

01:29:40.588 --> 01:29:43.258
But my friend said that you did great.
The audience loved you.

01:29:43.341 --> 01:29:45.343
Yeah. I killed.

01:29:45.427 --> 01:29:47.721
I got to live the dream.

01:29:47.804 --> 01:29:49.389
It was amazing.

01:29:49.472 --> 01:29:53.018
But weird part is,
is it didn't feel as amazing

01:29:53.101 --> 01:29:55.437
as helping the kids this summer.

01:29:56.438 --> 01:29:57.439
Andy.

01:29:57.897 --> 01:30:01.484
You know, you could stick around
and work here with me.

01:30:03.111 --> 01:30:05.572
You do know I headline at Caesars, right?

01:30:06.239 --> 01:30:08.867
Yeah. I think I heard about that.
That's cool. That's cool.

01:30:08.950 --> 01:30:10.952
But you could come feature
for me sometime.

01:30:11.036 --> 01:30:13.705
The world could use a little Abraca-Duo.

01:30:14.456 --> 01:30:15.457
Deal.

01:30:15.540 --> 01:30:18.126
- And, wow, that is a really terrible name.
- Yeah.

01:30:21.046 --> 01:30:22.047
Hey, Dad.

01:30:22.130 --> 01:30:23.131
Judd.

01:30:24.424 --> 01:30:26.968
I don't understand.
Why didn't you perform?

01:30:27.052 --> 01:30:28.720
No, I did perform.

01:30:28.803 --> 01:30:31.848
All the Hearts' costumes, those are me.

01:30:33.016 --> 01:30:36.186
You designed those costumes?
Even the quick-change routine?

01:30:36.603 --> 01:30:38.146
All of them.

01:30:38.229 --> 01:30:40.440
Look, I know you want me to be a magician,

01:30:40.523 --> 01:30:43.693
but... this summer I realized I'm not one.

01:30:43.777 --> 01:30:45.653
I just love designing costumes.

01:30:45.737 --> 01:30:49.616
I love using fashion
to bring my friends' magic to life.

01:30:50.992 --> 01:30:52.410
Then you're mistaken...

01:30:55.038 --> 01:30:57.374
because that, son, is magic.

01:30:59.084 --> 01:31:01.795
I think I got fur in my nose.
I'm gonna go irrigate.

01:31:10.136 --> 01:31:12.764
- Hey! My gosh. Wow.
- Xerxes, hey! I'm gonna miss you.

01:31:13.473 --> 01:31:14.474
Look out!

01:31:16.267 --> 01:31:18.829
- How'd you do that? You have to tell me.
- You really wanna know?

01:31:18.853 --> 01:31:20.814
- Yeah.
- Come to camp with me next year.

01:31:20.897 --> 01:31:22.315
- Can I, Mom?
- Nope.

01:31:22.399 --> 01:31:25.485
'Cause next summer you're going
to camp with me. Yoga camp.

01:31:25.568 --> 01:31:26.569
Say what?

01:31:27.487 --> 01:31:30.699
All right, I'll think about it.

01:31:31.700 --> 01:31:33.326
- Can you believe it?
- I know.

01:31:35.203 --> 01:31:36.746
- Hey.
- Let's go get a snack.

01:31:36.830 --> 01:31:37.831
Okay.

01:31:38.707 --> 01:31:42.794
You were, pretty okay out there.

01:31:42.877 --> 01:31:44.337
Thanks, Vic.

01:31:46.673 --> 01:31:48.550
You should have these back.

01:31:49.718 --> 01:31:53.054
I didn't burn them. I just pocketed them.

01:31:53.722 --> 01:31:55.306
I know, not cool.

01:31:55.765 --> 01:31:57.600
I won't be such a jerk next year,
all right?

01:31:57.684 --> 01:32:03.732
But I will battle you for the Golden Wand
and regain my magic camp supremacy.

01:32:05.025 --> 01:32:06.192
Till next summer then.

01:32:14.993 --> 01:32:16.161
Theo.

01:32:17.120 --> 01:32:18.413
Hey.

01:32:18.496 --> 01:32:19.497
Hey.

01:32:20.540 --> 01:32:22.375
I have to go now.

01:32:25.628 --> 01:32:26.921
That's too bad.

01:32:27.464 --> 01:32:30.133
- You gonna call me?
- The second I get home.

01:32:30.216 --> 01:32:31.843
Just so you don't forget.

01:32:34.346 --> 01:32:35.930
Whoa!

01:32:36.014 --> 01:32:39.267
She went for it, just... Too aggressive.

01:32:44.689 --> 01:32:47.525
You did encourage me
to encourage her to participate...

01:32:48.735 --> 01:32:50.320
so this is you guys.

01:32:55.533 --> 01:32:57.160
There's a voice in your head.

01:32:57.243 --> 01:33:00.955
And that voice is crying out,
"Clean up your room!"

01:33:02.082 --> 01:33:06.044
Nope, sorry.
That was the voice of your dad.

01:33:06.127 --> 01:33:10.674
The voice in your head is saying,
"I want to be a magician."

01:33:10.757 --> 01:33:14.260
Scribbity-four-ish years ago
this guy, Roy Preston,

01:33:14.344 --> 01:33:20.308
founded the institute and the world-famous
Roy Preston Prememorial Theater.

01:33:20.767 --> 01:33:24.437
Which is sadly now
the Roy Preston Memorial Theater.

01:33:24.521 --> 01:33:26.481
Kidding. I'm still here.

01:33:27.023 --> 01:33:29.025
I brought in Andy to help me out.

01:33:29.109 --> 01:33:32.070
You'll build lasting relationships
with other young magicians.

01:33:32.153 --> 01:33:34.280
Even the weird ones.

01:33:34.364 --> 01:33:37.075
'Cause here, we're all the weird ones.

01:33:37.158 --> 01:33:39.160
- Cool bird, Ruth.
- Thanks, Andy.

01:33:39.244 --> 01:33:41.663
And the lunch service
has nondairy options.

01:33:41.746 --> 01:33:43.498
But don't take my word for it.

01:33:43.915 --> 01:33:45.750
Just ask any of our former campers,

01:33:45.834 --> 01:33:50.171
many of whom are now some of the most
successful magicians working today.

01:33:50.255 --> 01:33:52.424
Like me, Kristina Darkwood.

01:33:52.882 --> 01:33:55.510
Or better yet, come see for yourself at...

01:33:55.593 --> 01:33:58.096
Magic camp!

01:33:58.805 --> 01:34:00.515
It's the Institute of Magic.

01:34:01.349 --> 01:34:03.977
The Institute of Magic!
