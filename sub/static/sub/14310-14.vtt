00:01.159 --> 00:03.169
[instrumental music]

00:05.120 --> 00:08.150
(male narrator)
Long, long ago,
deep in the forest

00:08.169 --> 00:12.119
there was a hidden village
where tiny creatures lived.

00:12.140 --> 00:15.039
They called themselves Smurfs.

00:15.060 --> 00:17.019
They were good.

00:17.039 --> 00:20.039
[theme music]

00:22.190 --> 00:24.199
Then there was Gargamel.

00:24.219 --> 00:28.019
The evil wizard.
He was bad.

00:28.039 --> 00:30.079
Oh, I hate Smurfs.

00:31.170 --> 00:34.060
I'll get you,
I'll get all of you

00:34.079 --> 00:36.170
if it's the last thing
I ever do.

00:36.189 --> 00:38.000
[evil laughter]

00:38.189 --> 00:39.179
Unh!

00:39.200 --> 00:41.119
Ohhh, I'll get you!

00:41.140 --> 00:44.189
I'll find your village some day.
You'll be sorry..

00:44.210 --> 00:47.060
(male narrator)
Well, the forest is still there

00:47.079 --> 00:51.090
and if you listen,
you may hear Gargamel's rage.

00:51.109 --> 00:55.159
And if you were good,
you may just catch a glimpse

00:55.179 --> 00:57.070
of the Smurfs.

01:00.009 --> 01:02.020
[theme music]

01:09.150 --> 01:12.219
Papa Smurf, what are we going
to smurf for Smurfday tomorrow?

01:13.000 --> 01:15.129
Well, since it's the smurfiest
day of the year

01:15.150 --> 01:17.189
it must be something smurfy.

01:17.210 --> 01:19.219
I think we should have a parade.

01:20.000 --> 01:21.150
I hate parades.

01:21.170 --> 01:23.189
Ooh, let's smurf some fireworks.

01:23.210 --> 01:25.069
I hate fireworks.

01:25.090 --> 01:28.150
Or maybe a dance
with an orchestra and things.

01:28.170 --> 01:30.010
I hate things.

01:30.030 --> 01:32.140
No fireworks, no parade,
no dance.

01:32.159 --> 01:34.170
What do you want
for Smurfday, then?

01:34.189 --> 01:37.000
I hate Smurfday.

01:37.020 --> 01:40.079
One thing about Grouchy,
he may be crabby sometimes

01:40.099 --> 01:43.200
but he really
has a heart of stone.

01:43.219 --> 01:46.159
I know, we'll smurf
a great big cake.

01:46.180 --> 01:50.000
Now, why didn't I think of that?

01:50.020 --> 01:52.120
- Here's some flour.
- I've got the milk.

01:52.140 --> 01:54.099
Watch out, here comes the honey.

01:54.120 --> 01:56.030
[buzzing]

01:56.049 --> 01:58.049
- Let's see, flour..
- Milk.

01:58.069 --> 02:00.079
- Clumsy's getting honey.
- Uh-oh.

02:00.099 --> 02:02.030
We're fresh out of eggs.

02:03.060 --> 02:05.019
(Gargamel)
'Behold, Azrael'

02:05.040 --> 02:07.200
'my latest stroke of genius.'

02:07.219 --> 02:09.008
A magic egg.

02:09.030 --> 02:10.150
I'll put it here to cool

02:10.169 --> 02:13.110
and then when I tap
my magic egg once'

02:13.129 --> 02:17.170
'anything I say or anything
I want will come true.'

02:17.189 --> 02:19.039
[Gargamel cackles]

02:19.060 --> 02:20.210
Imagine what I can do

02:20.229 --> 02:23.099
to those
simpering Smurfs, Azrael.

02:23.120 --> 02:25.030
[Gargamel cackles]

02:25.050 --> 02:26.219
[mews]

02:29.189 --> 02:31.170
Gargamel!

02:31.189 --> 02:34.090
Big Mouth hungry.

02:34.110 --> 02:36.039
Oh, badness gracious!

02:36.060 --> 02:37.170
[Azrael mews]

02:37.189 --> 02:40.129
Quick, Azrael, the closet.

02:40.150 --> 02:43.219
Big Mouth want food.

02:44.000 --> 02:46.000
[dishes clatter]

02:46.020 --> 02:47.229
'Big Mouth love goodies.'

02:48.180 --> 02:50.110
[slurps]

02:52.129 --> 02:53.150
Mmm.

02:53.170 --> 02:56.000
Big Mouth love eggs.

03:00.159 --> 03:02.060
[sizzling]

03:04.219 --> 03:07.099
[yells]

03:08.199 --> 03:11.050
Too hot. Eat later.

03:15.219 --> 03:17.060
Oh, no.

03:17.079 --> 03:19.060
He's taken my magic egg.

03:19.079 --> 03:21.110
Azrael, we must get it back.

03:24.139 --> 03:26.219
[yawning]

03:27.000 --> 03:30.180
Big Mouth take nap,
then eat egg.

03:31.120 --> 03:34.050
[snoring]

03:40.110 --> 03:43.060
I hear him, Azrael.
Quickly, now.

03:44.069 --> 03:47.030
[Big Mouth stammering]

03:47.050 --> 03:50.189
The big oaf
is too stupid to.. Hey!

03:50.210 --> 03:52.229
[yowls]

03:53.009 --> 03:56.150
Why you take my egg?

03:56.170 --> 03:58.020
[Gargamel stammering]

03:58.039 --> 03:59.129
Help!

03:59.150 --> 04:02.039
[gagging]
Azrael, stop him!

04:02.060 --> 04:04.159
Reow. Uh-uh.

04:06.150 --> 04:07.229
(Gargamel)
The egg!

04:08.009 --> 04:10.050
Egg getting away.

04:14.000 --> 04:15.129
Oh, my, oh, my.

04:15.150 --> 04:18.009
I don't smurf eggs anywhere.

04:18.029 --> 04:19.209
But Papa Smurf says
we can't bake

04:19.230 --> 04:21.220
a Smurfday cake without eggs.

04:22.000 --> 04:25.199
There must be one somewhere
around. Papa Smurf says..

04:25.220 --> 04:26.199
[rumbling]

04:26.220 --> 04:28.009
What's that?

04:28.029 --> 04:30.180
Oh, it's probably just an..

04:30.199 --> 04:31.209
...egg!

04:34.149 --> 04:36.199
Boy, that's some egg.

04:36.220 --> 04:39.060
(Hefty)
'We can make the smurfiest
Smurfday cake ever'

04:39.079 --> 04:40.069
'with this egg.'

04:40.090 --> 04:41.220
I hate eggs.

04:46.209 --> 04:48.199
(Big Mouth)
'Where my egg?'

04:48.220 --> 04:51.000
'Big Mouth want egg.'

04:51.019 --> 04:53.170
[Brainy gulps]
It's Big Mouth.

04:53.189 --> 04:57.100
Oh, he's so big and scary.

04:57.120 --> 04:59.029
(Hefty)
Come on, this way.

05:00.209 --> 05:03.069
(Big Mouth)
'Big Mouth want egg.'

05:05.069 --> 05:07.180
(Smurfette)
Oh, smurf is me.

05:07.199 --> 05:09.100
Big Mouth is coming.

05:09.120 --> 05:13.060
Big Mouth hungry. Want egg.

05:14.000 --> 05:15.079
He's gone. Let's..

05:15.100 --> 05:16.180
(Gargamel)
'Azrael!'

05:17.209 --> 05:20.050
- Gargamel.
- Gargamel?

05:21.160 --> 05:24.230
That egg must be around here
somewhere, Azrael.

05:25.009 --> 05:27.019
Reow. Reow.

05:27.040 --> 05:29.089
[sniffs, then growls]

05:29.110 --> 05:31.129
(Big Mouth)
'Where Big Mouth's egg?'

05:31.149 --> 05:32.139
[yowling]

05:32.159 --> 05:34.230
I want my egg!

05:35.009 --> 05:37.129
Let's get out of here, Azrael.

05:37.149 --> 05:39.029
(Brainy)
'Are they g-gone?'

05:39.050 --> 05:42.029
Yeah. Let's smurf this egg
back to the village.

05:44.050 --> 05:47.069
(Smurfette)
Oh, I'm afraid
that nasty Gargamel

05:47.090 --> 05:49.060
and Big Mouth will come back.

05:49.079 --> 05:52.209
Oh, knock on smurf. I wish
we were back in the village.

05:56.069 --> 05:57.199
Unh! Huh?

05:59.139 --> 06:03.029
- Hey, where'd you come from?
- How'd you get here?

06:03.050 --> 06:04.019
[all murmuring]

06:04.040 --> 06:05.189
Yeah, how did we get here?

06:05.209 --> 06:09.220
Back already? Smurf is me.
Where did you find that egg?

06:10.000 --> 06:12.110
I don't know. It came
rolling down a hill, and..

06:12.129 --> 06:14.079
[all chattering]

06:14.100 --> 06:18.040
Quiet! We have a cake to bake.
Smurf me a spoon.

06:18.060 --> 06:19.139
Here, Papa Smurf.

06:24.060 --> 06:26.120
Hmm. That's a hard egg.

06:27.170 --> 06:29.040
What kind of egg is this?

06:29.060 --> 06:32.090
Let me break it, Papa Smurf.

06:32.110 --> 06:36.019
I'll break that egg,
or I'm a smurfish sausage.

06:38.060 --> 06:41.100
Help! I'm a sausage!
I'm a sausage!

06:41.120 --> 06:44.029
[all murmuring]

06:44.050 --> 06:48.100
Hmm. He said something,
then hit the egg, and then..

06:48.120 --> 06:52.009
That's it!
This egg is a magic egg.

06:52.029 --> 06:54.029
(Vanity)
It's a magic egg.

06:54.050 --> 06:56.040
- I wanna try.
- Me first.

06:56.060 --> 06:57.189
I hate magic eggs.

06:57.209 --> 07:00.180
- Me, me, me, let me.
- Come on.

07:00.199 --> 07:02.139
I wanna be rich.

07:05.209 --> 07:08.170
I wanna be pink
with blue flowers.

07:11.160 --> 07:14.170
I want a great big barrel
of sarsaparilla.

07:17.120 --> 07:20.170
Make me the best horn player
in the whole world.

07:21.220 --> 07:23.060
[horn music]

07:25.139 --> 07:27.139
Make me just like Papa Smurf.

07:29.079 --> 07:32.029
I wanna be Papa Smurf too.

07:32.050 --> 07:35.079
No, make me Papa Smurf.
I'm smurfier.

07:37.180 --> 07:41.000
Great smurf. I have to put
a stop to this nonsense.

07:41.019 --> 07:44.120
(Brainy)
No fair. I was Papa Smurf
before you were.

07:44.139 --> 07:45.209
(Handy)
No, I am.

07:45.230 --> 07:48.170
(Poet)
I'm the smurfiest.
I should be Papa Smurf.

07:48.189 --> 07:52.199
What's this? If you're me,
then I'm a monkey's uncle.

07:53.120 --> 07:56.009
[jabbering]

07:56.029 --> 07:57.220
It's my turn, Lazy.

07:58.000 --> 08:01.189
No, it's not. You're a smurf
with a face like a troll.

08:03.069 --> 08:06.199
Oh, no. My beautiful face
is ruined.

08:06.220 --> 08:08.230
You're a smurf with big ears

08:09.009 --> 08:12.029
and a long tail
and hair all over.

08:14.230 --> 08:17.129
[jabbering]

08:17.149 --> 08:19.139
This is a fine kettle
of smurf.

08:19.160 --> 08:22.129
That magic egg is turning my
little Smurfs into monsters

08:22.149 --> 08:25.189
and nobody will listen to me.
I've got to get rid of it

08:25.209 --> 08:27.139
before it makes monkeys
of us all.

08:27.160 --> 08:30.009
(Brainy)
Let's hide the egg

08:30.029 --> 08:32.159
and take turns
smurfing our own wishes.

08:32.179 --> 08:35.070
(Poet)
Yeah, we'll keep it just for us.

08:40.039 --> 08:43.049
It's gone. Well, there's
another way to handle this.

08:43.070 --> 08:46.149
Uh, hi, Papa Smurf,
and, Papa Smurf..

08:46.169 --> 08:49.059
...and, uh, you too,
Papa Smurf. Heh.

08:49.080 --> 08:51.220
(Brainy)
What are you doing
in there, Clumsy?

08:52.000 --> 08:56.029
You're the biggest smurfiest oaf
in the whole world.

08:58.159 --> 09:00.210
[in deep voice]
Uh, what happened to me?

09:00.230 --> 09:02.029
[Brainy yells]
Yeow!

09:02.049 --> 09:04.009
(Brainy)
Run for your smurf.

09:05.009 --> 09:06.070
[Smurfette yells]

09:06.090 --> 09:09.070
Uh, what's going on,
Smurfette? Huh?

09:09.090 --> 09:12.000
Huh? How'd you get so small?

09:12.019 --> 09:14.139
Papa Smurf, Papa Smurf!

09:14.159 --> 09:17.090
Antidote, antidote.
It must be here somewhere.

09:17.110 --> 09:19.029
Papa Smurf.

09:19.049 --> 09:24.029
Oh, my. You're not Papa Smurf.
What are you doing in here?

09:24.049 --> 09:25.129
[jabbers]

09:25.149 --> 09:28.179
Papa Smurf wouldn't
like you being in here.

09:28.200 --> 09:30.200
Go on, now. Shoo. Out, out, out.

09:30.220 --> 09:32.129
[Papa jabbering]

09:39.049 --> 09:41.149
- Big Mouth's egg.
- Big Mouth!

09:41.169 --> 09:45.100
Mmm. Big Mouth happy now.

09:45.120 --> 09:48.009
Smurfs bring back egg.

09:49.070 --> 09:51.220
Get down from there,
you silly monkey.

09:52.000 --> 09:54.149
Papa Smurf will be back
any minute now.

09:54.169 --> 09:56.210
And now some essence
of smurfroot.

09:56.230 --> 10:00.039
(Smurfette)
'Just wait till
Papa Smurf finds out.'

10:03.019 --> 10:07.019
Oh, Papa Smurf. Papa Smurf,
I thought..

10:09.059 --> 10:12.029
Quickly, Smurfette.
We must find that magic egg

10:12.049 --> 10:14.080
before it smurfs
any more damage.

10:16.120 --> 10:17.200
[crunch]
Ah, ooh!

10:19.200 --> 10:21.200
[crunch]
Ah, ooh!

10:27.009 --> 10:30.139
[yells]

10:30.159 --> 10:33.210
That egg must be around here
someplace, Azrael.

10:33.230 --> 10:36.169
Never mind, Azrael. I found it.

10:39.059 --> 10:41.049
(Poet)
Oh, hi, Papa Smurf.

10:41.070 --> 10:44.059
[Brainy gulps]
Um, hi, Papa Smurf.

10:44.080 --> 10:47.000
(Handy)
Smurfy day today,
right, Papa Smurf?

10:49.110 --> 10:51.220
Now, where is the magic egg?

10:52.000 --> 10:53.159
- We'll show you.
- It's there, Papa Smurf.

10:53.179 --> 10:55.090
Come on.
We'll show you where it is.

10:55.110 --> 10:57.049
(Brainy)
Come on, hurry up, let's go.

10:59.000 --> 11:01.019
Azrael, my magic egg.

11:01.039 --> 11:04.059
At last! Now I can polish off

11:04.080 --> 11:06.090
those revolting little smurfs

11:06.110 --> 11:08.029
once and for all.

11:08.049 --> 11:09.210
[cackles]

11:09.230 --> 11:12.059
What shall we have first,
Azrael?

11:12.080 --> 11:14.179
How about Smurfs on a platter?

11:14.200 --> 11:16.070
[cackles]

11:16.090 --> 11:18.210
Bring us two smurfs
on a platter.

11:20.120 --> 11:22.230
What's this?
I ordered smurfs.

11:23.009 --> 11:25.110
Not these scrawny yucks!

11:25.129 --> 11:29.090
- Who's a scrawny?
- Who's a yuck?

11:29.110 --> 11:32.169
Magic egg, fetch me
a nice, plump..

11:32.190 --> 11:38.090
No, no, no, make it the biggest,
plumpest smurf of them all.

11:38.110 --> 11:39.220
[cackles]

11:40.000 --> 11:43.159
Uh, would some Smurf tell me
what's going on?

11:43.179 --> 11:45.029
[Gargamel yells]

11:45.049 --> 11:47.049
Run for your life!

11:47.070 --> 11:50.059
Gee, hi, Papa Smurf.
I sure wish--

11:50.080 --> 11:52.230
Don't smurf a word, Clumsy.

11:53.009 --> 11:56.149
Magic egg, I want everything
to be like it was before.

11:59.070 --> 12:01.110
Now, after all
I've seen today

12:01.129 --> 12:03.190
there's just
one more magic wish to make.

12:03.210 --> 12:07.039
Oh, boy. Another magic wish.

12:07.059 --> 12:09.129
Because you've all been
so selfish and silly

12:09.149 --> 12:11.200
and un-Smurf-like
with your wishes

12:11.220 --> 12:14.129
I want this magic egg
to disappear

12:14.149 --> 12:17.009
never to be smurfed again.

12:19.029 --> 12:20.149
[Smurfs groan]

12:23.200 --> 12:26.080
Well, I'm glad that's over with.

12:26.100 --> 12:29.230
Cake or no cake, this has been
a Smurfday to remember.

12:30.009 --> 12:33.110
Look what I found.
Pretty smurfy, huh?

12:33.129 --> 12:34.149
[laughs]

12:34.169 --> 12:36.000
Oh, no!

12:36.019 --> 12:38.190
(Greedy)
Yippee! Now we can make
more wishes.

12:38.210 --> 12:40.019
Another magic egg.

12:40.039 --> 12:42.149
[all clamoring]

12:42.169 --> 12:43.230
[laughing]

12:45.019 --> 12:46.200
(Greedy)
I'm first, and I want..

12:47.179 --> 12:49.009
[boom]

12:50.230 --> 12:53.120
[laughs]

12:53.139 --> 12:55.139
Got you, didn't I?

12:55.159 --> 12:57.100
[Jokey laughs]

12:59.159 --> 13:01.210
[theme music]
