WEBVTT

00:07.500 --> 00:09.800
So, care to
explain yourself?

00:12.833 --> 00:14.900
I...I...

00:15.000 --> 00:16.267
- Would you turn
that thing off.

00:16.367 --> 00:17.833
Why don't you leave
Frankie alone?

00:17.933 --> 00:19.200
She never did
anything to you.

00:19.300 --> 00:20.767
- She threatened
my math supremacy.

00:20.867 --> 00:22.633
What's the world
gonna think?

00:22.733 --> 00:23.900
The world?

00:24.000 --> 00:25.800
Try Mr. Manhart
and the nine kids in AP math.

00:25.900 --> 00:27.267
- The only way
she could have beaten me

00:27.367 --> 00:29.900
is by cheating with
a hidden radio transmitter.

00:30.000 --> 00:31.800
Give it up, cheater.
Where is it?

00:31.900 --> 00:33.767
- Is that true?
Did you cheat?

00:33.867 --> 00:36.900
Do you have some
kind of transmitter?

00:39.100 --> 00:40.800
Yes.

00:40.900 --> 00:42.067
Ohhhh...

00:42.167 --> 00:43.667
- Of course, it's true.
- Oooh...

00:43.767 --> 00:47.033
- Not about cheating--about
having a radio transmitter.

00:47.133 --> 00:49.867
I have one, too.
We all do.

00:49.967 --> 00:51.767
Look!

00:51.867 --> 00:52.900
Ohhhh...

00:53.000 --> 00:54.133
- Wait, why is
it doing that?

00:54.233 --> 00:56.433
- Cell phones give off
radio frequency...

00:56.533 --> 00:57.867
- ...frequency
radiation.

00:57.967 --> 00:59.367
I forgot about that one.

00:59.467 --> 01:02.333
But that doesn't change
the fact that she's a cheater.

01:02.433 --> 01:05.433
I know she is.
Nobody's that good.

01:09.567 --> 01:11.200
In Gdansk, Poland today,

01:11.300 --> 01:13.800
a shipyard reported major
damage when a teenaged girl

01:13.900 --> 01:15.600
commandeered
a construction crane

01:15.700 --> 01:17.767
into several buildings and--

01:17.867 --> 01:18.933
- Do you think
this involves us?

01:19.067 --> 01:20.067
- It fits their pattern.

01:20.133 --> 01:21.633
I'm late!

01:23.233 --> 01:25.900
- Well, have a great day.

01:26.067 --> 01:27.567
I love you!

01:28.500 --> 01:30.600
I will
have a great day, too.

01:30.700 --> 01:32.967
Thanks!

01:33.067 --> 01:34.500
- Good morning, parents.
- Good morning, Frankie.

01:34.600 --> 01:36.767
At least one of our
kids acts like a human.

01:36.867 --> 01:38.333
- Frankie,
I'm worried about--

01:38.433 --> 01:40.567
- Worrying causes wrinkles
on humans' foreheads.

01:40.667 --> 01:43.100
There are currently 747,000
anti-wrinkle creams

01:43.200 --> 01:44.600
being sold on-line.

01:44.700 --> 01:47.767
Some ancient Chinese cultures
believe this helps.

01:47.867 --> 01:49.067
- Oh...

01:49.133 --> 01:51.133
No, I'm worried about
this Tammy girl

01:51.233 --> 01:52.700
you told me about
last night.

01:52.800 --> 01:53.933
- Why?

01:54.067 --> 01:55.167
- Going around school
with an RF scanner?

01:55.267 --> 01:56.767
- Is that not a normal
human action?

01:56.867 --> 01:58.433
- No, which is why
I need you to be extra--

01:58.533 --> 02:00.533
Who could that be?

02:00.633 --> 02:01.767
- It is Dayton Reyes.

02:01.867 --> 02:04.067
We arranged to meet
and walk to school together.

02:06.100 --> 02:08.300
- Oh, come on in.
- Hey, Frankie.

02:08.400 --> 02:10.400
Hi, uh,
Mr. and Mrs. Gaines.

02:10.500 --> 02:13.600
I mean, Doctor.
Do you go by "Doctor"?

02:13.700 --> 02:17.500
or PhD? BSEE? MSEE? PhDE?

02:17.600 --> 02:19.633
Doctor is fine.

02:19.733 --> 02:20.867
- Dayton Reyes
is my BFF.

02:20.967 --> 02:22.800
That is an acronym
for Best Friend Forever.

02:22.900 --> 02:25.200
My BFF and I are going
to school now.

02:25.300 --> 02:26.733
- Oh.

02:28.633 --> 02:29.633
- Have good day, Frankie.

02:29.733 --> 02:31.867
- Thanks. You, too.

02:31.967 --> 02:34.167
- Bye. Nice to meet you.

02:39.733 --> 02:41.200
- Uh-oh, what's wrong?

02:41.300 --> 02:43.267
- I don't know if I've thought
this whole school thing through.

02:43.367 --> 02:45.567
I didn't think about Frankie
having a best friend.

02:45.667 --> 02:47.833
- I think it's great.
What could be wrong with that?

02:47.933 --> 02:49.567
- How is she going
to keep her secret?

02:49.667 --> 02:52.267
My best friend in high school
knew everything about me.

02:52.367 --> 02:54.067
Why do you walk so fast?

02:54.100 --> 02:55.533
The bell for first
period won't ring

02:55.633 --> 02:57.667
for another nine minutes
and 34 seconds.

02:57.767 --> 02:59.133
- I wanna be early.

02:59.233 --> 03:01.400
I'm hoping to bump into
Byron before class,

03:01.500 --> 03:04.067
you know, casually,
but on purpose.

03:04.167 --> 03:06.133
- No, I'm not familiar
with this action.

03:06.233 --> 03:08.533
I will have to observe it
and save it to my hard drive.

03:08.633 --> 03:10.467
- Good morning, ladies.
What's new?

03:10.567 --> 03:12.167
- Stock prices fell
in early morning trading

03:12.267 --> 03:14.067
due to weakness
in global demand.

03:14.100 --> 03:15.867
- Oh, yeah.

03:17.567 --> 03:19.467
I'm so sorry!

03:19.567 --> 03:22.267
Hey, you, Hawk!
Get her for me!

03:24.067 --> 03:26.367
I can't believe this.

03:26.467 --> 03:28.600
I'm gonna go try
to wash this out.

03:28.700 --> 03:30.400
I'll talk to you later.

03:30.500 --> 03:33.300
- It's already
got 500 likes,

03:33.400 --> 03:37.767
and there are only
350 students at this school.

03:37.867 --> 03:39.700
It could go viral.

03:39.800 --> 03:40.933
- What could go viral?

03:41.067 --> 03:42.100
- This GIF of you--

03:42.200 --> 03:43.500
- It's kittens
surfing on a shark.

03:44.600 --> 03:46.833
- I love kitten GIFs.
Can I see?

03:46.933 --> 03:50.733
- Uh, sure.
Oh...no.

03:50.833 --> 03:52.600
Battery died. Sorry.

03:52.700 --> 03:54.767
- Too bad. I thought
it might take my mind

03:54.867 --> 03:56.433
off the nightmare
at The Garage.

03:56.533 --> 03:58.333
I've got to make
things right.

03:58.433 --> 04:00.533
- You're gonna
apologize to Frankie.

04:00.633 --> 04:02.133
- What? No way.

04:02.233 --> 04:04.300
- Your obsession with
her is becoming unhealthy.

04:04.400 --> 04:06.800
- What? Who says?
- Lucia.

04:08.200 --> 04:09.667
She's crazy.

04:09.767 --> 04:11.467
- Something's not right
about that Frankie,

04:11.567 --> 04:13.600
and I'm gonna get
to the bottom of it.

04:16.567 --> 04:19.333
- ♪ Feels like things
are getting real, real ♪

04:19.433 --> 04:23.167
♪ Never felt so alive,

04:23.267 --> 04:26.600

04:26.700 --> 04:29.300
♪ Feels like things

04:33.633 --> 04:35.133
- Hi, Cole. Having
a tutoring session

04:35.233 --> 04:36.667
after fifth period?
- Nope.

04:36.767 --> 04:39.100
- What? Why are you
acting this way?

04:39.200 --> 04:40.667
- I should ask you
the same thing.

04:40.767 --> 04:43.633
- What am I doing?
- To me, nothing.

04:43.733 --> 04:45.167
But what about
to Frankie?

04:45.267 --> 04:47.567
She never did anything to you
except win a stupid math bee.

04:47.667 --> 04:51.067
- Well, it's not
my fault. It's...

04:51.100 --> 04:53.067
- ketosis.
- Ke-whatsis?

04:53.133 --> 04:54.733
- Ketosis--
it's what happens

04:54.833 --> 04:56.667
when you don't eat
carbohydrates.

04:56.767 --> 04:58.900
It can make you
temporarily insane.

04:59.067 --> 05:00.300
- You're making
that up.

05:00.400 --> 05:01.633
- No, it's totally real.

05:01.733 --> 05:03.333
I can send you
the literature.

05:03.433 --> 05:05.667
- You don't have
to convince me.

05:05.767 --> 05:07.133
But you ought to
at least apologize.

05:07.233 --> 05:08.433
I'm sorry.

05:08.533 --> 05:11.400
- Not to me.
To Frankie.

05:11.500 --> 05:15.733
- I'm so about to
do that right now.

05:15.833 --> 05:18.233
- Okay. Good.

05:18.333 --> 05:20.467
You know, you two
have a lot in common.

05:20.567 --> 05:22.400
You're both super-smart.

05:22.500 --> 05:24.200
Why don't you try
being friends with her?

05:25.833 --> 05:27.367
Awesome idea.

05:27.467 --> 05:29.500
You know, we just got
off on the wrong foot.

05:29.600 --> 05:31.233
We need to make
a fresh start.

05:31.333 --> 05:32.933
- Well, I'm glad
to hear it.

05:33.067 --> 05:34.933
Gotta go to class.

05:36.833 --> 05:39.233
- Now you're going to
make friends with her?

05:39.333 --> 05:41.400
- Try to keep up, Makayla.

05:41.500 --> 05:42.767
It's like they say,

05:42.867 --> 05:45.133
keep your friends close
and your enemies closer.

05:45.233 --> 05:47.167
This will solve everything.

05:47.267 --> 05:49.067
I'm so glad
I thought of it.

05:49.100 --> 05:50.400
- You didn't. Cole did.

05:50.500 --> 05:52.733
She's crazy.

05:52.833 --> 06:04.200
- ♪

06:04.300 --> 06:05.300
- Hi, Dayton Reyes.

06:05.400 --> 06:06.867
You are wearing
a raincoat,

06:06.967 --> 06:08.867
but the weather forecast called
for continued clear skies.

06:08.967 --> 06:11.100
- I borrowed it
from the Lost & Found.

06:11.200 --> 06:12.300
It's all I could find.

06:12.400 --> 06:14.767
It belonged to a football
player, or something.

06:14.867 --> 06:17.067
- Please turn to Chapter 6
in your textbooks.

06:22.600 --> 06:24.067
- It's ruined.

06:24.100 --> 06:26.200
- It needs to be treated
with perchloroethylene,

06:26.300 --> 06:27.600
also known as
dry cleaning fluid.

06:27.700 --> 06:29.600
It's an effective
stain remover--

06:29.700 --> 06:30.867
although highly toxic.

06:30.967 --> 06:32.767
It has to be handled
with extreme care.

06:32.867 --> 06:34.800
- Great. But I don't think
we're gonna find any

06:34.900 --> 06:37.467
pethorlac...whatever,
in school.

06:40.333 --> 06:42.867
- It's doubtful, but it wouldn't
be difficult to catalyze.

06:42.967 --> 06:45.700
- Really? You know
how to do that?

06:45.800 --> 06:48.433
You're the best,
Frankie Gaines.

06:48.533 --> 06:49.700
- You're the best,
Dayton Reyes.

06:49.800 --> 06:52.233
- I have fifth period free.
- So do I.

06:52.333 --> 06:54.633
- I have fifth
period free, too.

06:54.733 --> 06:58.767
But this period
we all have class.

07:05.900 --> 07:09.400
- Uh-oh, Tammy's only happy
when she's doing something mean.

07:09.500 --> 07:11.067
Be careful around her.

07:11.100 --> 07:13.167
Definitely keep her
at arm's length.

07:13.267 --> 07:14.333
- Noted.

07:14.433 --> 07:15.767
I have to go to Latin.

07:15.867 --> 07:17.700
I'll meet you in the chem
lab, fifth period.

07:17.800 --> 07:20.600
- I sent a reminder to my
precision time protocol adapter.

07:20.700 --> 07:23.133
Did you?
- I'll probably just remember.

07:25.100 --> 07:26.567
- Oh, Cole,
may I have a moment?

07:26.667 --> 07:27.800
- Hi, Ms. Hough.

07:27.900 --> 07:29.633
I know you're probably
mad about my math grade.

07:29.733 --> 07:31.567
- Oh, I'm not mad,
but I am concerned.

07:31.667 --> 07:33.633
There just doesn't seem
to be much improvement.

07:33.733 --> 07:35.600
Have you been having
your tutoring sessions?

07:35.700 --> 07:37.667
- They're not really helping.
Oh, but I'll keep trying.

07:37.767 --> 07:40.633
- You know, sometimes students
and tutors just don't click.

07:40.733 --> 07:41.900
It's like two
of my cats--

07:42.067 --> 07:44.733
Hairball Potter
and Permoine Granger.

07:44.833 --> 07:46.833
They should be
best friends,

07:46.933 --> 07:50.167
but they just
don't get along.

07:50.267 --> 07:51.400
Wait, what was my point?

07:51.500 --> 07:54.267
Oh, right, maybe
we should try someone else.

07:54.367 --> 07:55.467
Mr. Manhart tells me

07:55.567 --> 07:57.300
that Frankie Gaines
is strong in math.

07:57.400 --> 07:59.600
Do you know her?
- We've met.

07:59.700 --> 08:00.967
- Let me talk to her,

08:01.067 --> 08:02.733
see if she'd
be willing to tutor you.

08:02.833 --> 08:06.100
Hopefully, you'll get along
like my twin Abyssinians.

08:06.200 --> 08:09.167
- How many cats do
you have, Ms. Hough?

08:10.600 --> 08:12.400
Ms. Hough, are you okay?

08:12.500 --> 08:15.133
- Hang on.
I'm just counting.

08:20.533 --> 08:22.200
- Can I talk to
you in private?

08:22.300 --> 08:24.300
Ohhhh...

08:24.400 --> 08:26.367
- Just a quick chat.

08:31.367 --> 08:32.433
What are you doing?

08:32.533 --> 08:34.067
- Keeping you
at arm's length.

08:34.133 --> 08:37.832
- Oh...look, I'm really
sorry about yesterday.

08:37.933 --> 08:39.799
I was totally out of line.

08:39.900 --> 08:42.633
Your math skills
are so amazing.

08:42.732 --> 08:44.600
You know, we're like
the school's math masters--

08:44.700 --> 08:45.967
number one, number two.

08:46.067 --> 08:48.067
- Since I defeated
you in the math bee,

08:48.167 --> 08:50.133
it would be number one
and number two.

08:50.233 --> 08:51.433
- Right.

08:51.533 --> 08:54.533
Like I said,
you're so amazing at math.

08:54.633 --> 08:56.467
I hope we can just
put this behind us

08:56.567 --> 08:58.100
and be friends.

09:00.133 --> 09:01.167
- I'm confused,
Tammy Gilroy.

09:01.267 --> 09:02.967
Your friendship
proposal contradicts

09:03.067 --> 09:05.367
over 70 negative mentions of me
in your super-secret eDiary.

09:05.467 --> 09:07.733
- Yeah, you know, we just
got off on the wrong foot.

09:07.833 --> 09:09.267
When you make a first--

09:09.367 --> 09:10.933
you read my diary?!

09:11.067 --> 09:13.833
- Yes. Not all of it. Only
the sections that mention me.

09:13.933 --> 09:18.333
However, there are very few
sections that didn't.

09:24.600 --> 09:26.367
- Your forehead
is all wrinkled.

09:26.467 --> 09:28.667
You should maybe get
an anti-wrinkle cream for that.

09:28.767 --> 09:31.367
- How did she read
my super-secret eDiary?

09:31.467 --> 09:33.267
- I didn't know you had
a super-secret eDiary.

09:33.367 --> 09:35.867
- 'Cause I was super-good
at keeping it super-secret.

09:35.967 --> 09:37.733
Now Frankie knows
everything.

09:37.833 --> 09:40.800
If she blabs,
my life is over.

09:40.900 --> 09:42.833
- I think you may be
overreacting a tad--

09:42.933 --> 09:44.233
which can be dangerous.

09:44.333 --> 09:46.533
The 30 Years' War was started
by an overreaction.

09:46.633 --> 09:49.833
- The 30 Years' War is a game
of checkers compared to this.

09:49.933 --> 09:52.900
I wrote terrible things
about everyone in school.

09:54.167 --> 09:56.100
- So, um, what did
you write about us?

09:57.200 --> 09:58.233
- Nothing.

09:58.333 --> 10:01.167
Just that you're smart
and nice and pretty.

10:01.267 --> 10:02.767
- But you just said--

10:02.867 --> 10:05.333
- Oh, look at
that evil smile.

10:05.433 --> 10:07.933
I don't even wanna think about
what she's planning for me.

10:08.033 --> 10:09.900
I've got to get
on her good side.

10:10.000 --> 10:11.767
- There are those
wrinkles again.

10:11.867 --> 10:14.167
- Don't interrupt
her scheming.

10:14.267 --> 10:15.900
Scheme away.

10:17.700 --> 10:19.000
- I kept approximately
80 centimeters

10:19.100 --> 10:21.400
away from Tammy
when she apologized.

10:21.500 --> 10:23.933
- Really?
She apologized?

10:24.033 --> 10:25.133
- She also
contradicted her diary

10:25.233 --> 10:27.500
by saying she wants
to be my friend.

10:27.600 --> 10:29.200
- Don't trust her.

10:31.433 --> 10:32.500
Now what?

10:32.600 --> 10:34.300
- Heat garment
for two minutes.

10:42.833 --> 10:45.400
- Frankie,
now I feel worse.

10:45.500 --> 10:46.567
- Did your skin
come into contact

10:46.667 --> 10:47.833
with the perchloroethylene?

10:47.933 --> 10:50.167
I must get you under
the emergency 100 gallon shower.

10:50.267 --> 10:53.133
- No, I mean about Tammy.

10:53.233 --> 10:57.000
Ever since we read her diary,
something's been eating at me.

10:57.100 --> 11:00.233
I tried to put it
out of my mind, but I can't.

11:00.333 --> 11:01.933
What we did was wrong.

11:02.067 --> 11:03.200
- Wrong in what way?

11:03.300 --> 11:05.933
- A person puts their
most private thoughts

11:06.067 --> 11:09.833
and feelings in a diary,
just for them to see.

11:09.933 --> 11:12.733
Even if Tammy
is a mean jerk,

11:12.833 --> 11:14.900
what we did was just
as mean and jerky,

11:15.067 --> 11:17.233
and I feel terrible
about it.

11:22.800 --> 11:24.367
- Frankie?

11:24.467 --> 11:27.333
Frankie, are you okay?

11:31.100 --> 11:32.667
- Frankie? Frankie?

11:32.767 --> 11:35.067
Come on, Frankie.
Snap out of it.

11:35.133 --> 11:37.333
Is there some kind
of reboot sequence?

11:37.433 --> 11:39.433
Oh, control-alt-delete.

11:39.533 --> 11:40.967
Come on.

11:41.067 --> 11:42.400
Oh!

11:44.267 --> 11:46.600
- What are you doing,
Dayton Reyes?

11:46.700 --> 11:48.100
- Are you okay?

11:48.200 --> 11:49.933
You kind of glitched
out there for a minute.

11:50.067 --> 11:51.633
- Yes, I suffered
a hardware anomaly.

11:51.733 --> 11:52.733
- You sure did.

11:52.833 --> 11:54.333
- I'm not programmed
for emotions.

11:54.433 --> 11:55.667
But evidence suggests

11:55.767 --> 11:58.333
I may have experienced
feelings of guilt.

11:58.433 --> 11:59.500
What should we do?

11:59.600 --> 12:01.200
- Well, I think
we should delete

12:01.300 --> 12:03.100
Tammy's diary
from my phone.

12:03.200 --> 12:06.067
Deleted.

12:06.167 --> 12:09.733
- And we should do
something nice for Tammy.

12:11.100 --> 12:13.533
Do you smell smoke?

12:13.633 --> 12:15.267
Did some of your
wires get fried?

12:15.367 --> 12:19.167
- No. I identify
as oxidizing fabrics.

12:23.900 --> 12:26.400
- I'm sorry, Dayton Reyes.

12:26.500 --> 12:29.067
My precision time protocol
adaptor must have reset.

12:29.100 --> 12:30.433
- It was my fault.

12:30.533 --> 12:31.900
I wasn't paying attention.

12:32.067 --> 12:35.067
My dad gave me this
shirt for my birthday.

12:35.167 --> 12:43.800
- ♪

12:43.900 --> 12:46.067
- Frankie. Just the person
I was looking for.

12:46.167 --> 12:47.667
- You are just the person

12:47.767 --> 12:49.633
I was looking for,
too, Tammy Gilroy.

12:49.733 --> 12:51.067
- Step into my office.

12:51.167 --> 12:53.133
- The lavatory--also known
as the restroom, water closet,

12:53.233 --> 12:56.067
latrine, commode, outhouse,
john, facilities--

12:56.133 --> 12:57.767
and Tammy's office.

12:57.867 --> 12:59.433
- Uh, yeah.

13:06.833 --> 13:08.067
What do you want?

13:08.167 --> 13:09.933
- What do you want,
Tammy Gilroy?

13:10.067 --> 13:12.167
- I guess you're not gonna
make this easy on me.

13:12.267 --> 13:13.667
How about this?

13:13.767 --> 13:15.100
Do you know what
the Brain Squad is?

13:15.200 --> 13:16.900
- My hypothesis is...

13:17.067 --> 13:19.333
an elite team
of neurosurgeons?

13:19.433 --> 13:22.400
- No, it's Sepulveda High's
competitive academic team.

13:22.500 --> 13:24.400
- Ah, "brain" as
in definition 2.3--

13:24.500 --> 13:26.100
an exceptionally
intelligent person.

13:26.200 --> 13:28.300
- Exactly.
Like you, Frankie.

13:29.500 --> 13:30.800
Out!

13:30.900 --> 13:32.733
As captain, I can put
you on the team.

13:32.833 --> 13:33.900
It's super prestigious,

13:34.067 --> 13:36.800
and you bring eternal
glory to our school.

13:36.900 --> 13:38.467
What do you say?
Would you like that?

13:38.567 --> 13:40.800
- Do you want me to bring
eternal glory to our school?

13:40.900 --> 13:42.167
- Huh?

13:42.267 --> 13:44.067
- I want to do
something nice for you.

13:44.100 --> 13:45.967
- Um...okay.

13:46.067 --> 13:48.867
Yes, I want you to bring
eternal glory to our school,

13:48.967 --> 13:50.433
and just so we're clear,

13:50.533 --> 13:52.467
if we do this,
you won't tell anyone

13:52.567 --> 13:54.733
about what you read
in my diary, right?

13:54.833 --> 13:55.933
- Absolutely not.

13:56.067 --> 13:58.100
I would never do that,
because it is wrong.

13:58.200 --> 14:00.167
- Okay.
We have a deal.

14:08.200 --> 14:09.933
- So?
- I put her on the Brain Squad,

14:10.067 --> 14:11.467
and she agreed to
keep her mouth shut.

14:11.567 --> 14:13.967
- The squad's full.
Did someone leave?

14:14.067 --> 14:15.867
- No. Why?
- According to the rules

14:15.967 --> 14:17.500
of the National Brain
Squad Association,

14:17.600 --> 14:19.467
teams comprise of
five squad members.

14:19.567 --> 14:22.933
Sepulveda's is us, plus Byron
and John. That's five.

14:23.067 --> 14:24.333
Oh, right.

14:24.433 --> 14:26.200
- So, I guess you
need a new plan now.

14:26.300 --> 14:28.067
- One of you's gonna
have to leave the team.

14:28.100 --> 14:29.400
- What?
- Why us?

14:29.500 --> 14:31.533
- Well, I can't ask John
or Byron to leave.

14:31.633 --> 14:33.100
They'll wanna know why.

14:33.200 --> 14:34.933
Don't look at me
like that.

14:35.067 --> 14:36.133
It's only temporary.

14:36.233 --> 14:37.667
So, who's it gonna be?

14:37.767 --> 14:38.700
Not me!

14:38.800 --> 14:40.067
- Well, don't ask
me to choose.

14:40.167 --> 14:41.267
You're my best friends.

14:41.367 --> 14:43.700
- Okay, then I'll
choose for you,

14:43.800 --> 14:46.133
and I choose Makayla.
- Hey!

14:46.233 --> 14:48.100
- I've got it.
We'll have a competition.

14:48.200 --> 14:50.900
Loser gets cut.
Fair and square.

14:55.233 --> 14:57.500
- Um, what's going on?

14:59.067 --> 15:01.467
- Stand up straight, please,
Dayton Reyes.

15:03.700 --> 15:05.667
Turn around, please.

15:06.933 --> 15:08.233
- What are you doing?

15:08.333 --> 15:10.200
- Measuring you in order
to make a new shirt

15:10.300 --> 15:12.067
to replace the one
that was ruined.

15:12.133 --> 15:13.100
- Really?

15:13.200 --> 15:14.367
You can make clothes?

15:14.467 --> 15:16.067
Of course, you can.

15:16.167 --> 15:17.533
You can do anything.

15:17.633 --> 15:33.600
- ♪

15:34.600 --> 15:44.600
♪

15:49.067 --> 15:51.267
Frankie, you're the best!

15:53.533 --> 15:55.667
But you're crushing
my spine!

15:56.667 --> 15:57.867
- Apologies.

15:57.967 --> 16:00.100
I'm still learning the
appropriate force for hugging.

16:00.200 --> 16:01.533
Three hundred pounds
per square inch--

16:01.633 --> 16:03.333
too much for hugs.

16:05.567 --> 16:07.300
You have 45 minutes.

16:07.400 --> 16:09.433
Whoever gets the higher
score stays on the team.

16:09.533 --> 16:10.800
Good luck.

16:10.900 --> 16:13.467
But not too much luck,
'cause if one of you bombs,

16:13.567 --> 16:16.467
it'll make this a lot easier.

16:17.367 --> 16:18.933
- Where are you going?

16:19.067 --> 16:20.400
- To find Frankie.

16:20.500 --> 16:22.800
I have the dragon at bay
and now I have to slay it.

16:22.900 --> 16:25.267
- Have you been watching
"Thrones of Destiny" again?

16:25.367 --> 16:28.233
- I mean, I deleted my diary
so no one else can access it.

16:28.333 --> 16:30.267
But Frankie still
has a copy.

16:30.367 --> 16:32.333
I have to find it
and destroy it.

16:32.433 --> 16:34.367
- How do you plan
to accomplish that?

16:34.467 --> 16:37.567
- By infiltrating
the dragon's lair.

16:39.933 --> 16:41.667
Thank you so much
for tutoring me, Frankie.

16:41.767 --> 16:44.067
I was so stoked when Ms. Hough
told me you'd do it.

16:44.167 --> 16:45.933
- I'm happy to
help you, Cole Reyes.

16:46.067 --> 16:47.667
- I hope you don't
think I'm...stupid?

16:47.767 --> 16:49.633
I think I math blockage
in my brain.

16:49.733 --> 16:50.900
- Math blockage?

16:51.067 --> 16:52.500
I'm not familiar with
that neurological condition.

16:52.600 --> 16:55.633
- It's very rare.
I'm the only known case.

16:55.733 --> 16:57.567
But I can be cured through
some good tutoring.

16:57.667 --> 16:59.633
- Then I'll start with
a simple percentage problem.

16:59.733 --> 17:02.167
If you had a pizza
with 12 slices,

17:02.267 --> 17:03.967
and someone took
75 percent of the pizza,

17:04.067 --> 17:05.833
how many slices
do you have left?

17:05.933 --> 17:07.567
- Twelve slices.
- Incorrect.

17:07.666 --> 17:09.532
How about this?
What does the other person have?

17:09.633 --> 17:11.800
- A broken arm.
Nobody takes my pizza.

17:13.900 --> 17:15.867
- This is impossible.

17:15.967 --> 17:17.067
If you can pass this test,

17:17.166 --> 17:19.067
you deserve to be
on the Brain Squad.

17:19.133 --> 17:22.067
- No, this test
is ridiculous.

17:22.099 --> 17:23.333
I know advanced math,
quantum physics,

17:23.433 --> 17:26.300
ancient history,
and six languages.

17:26.400 --> 17:31.433
But I don't know anything
about Danish tax law?

17:31.533 --> 17:33.167
Why should
something so random

17:33.267 --> 17:36.300
determine which one of us
has to leave the team?

17:37.500 --> 17:38.767
Where are you going?

17:38.867 --> 17:40.933
- To tell Tammy she can...

17:41.067 --> 17:42.567
- "Eat your sweatpants,"
in Danish?

17:42.667 --> 17:43.667
- Ja!

17:43.767 --> 17:47.967
- ♪

17:48.067 --> 17:50.300
- "X" equals 64?
- Sorry, Cole.

17:50.400 --> 17:52.633
That is incorrect.
- I can't do this.

17:54.333 --> 17:55.633
- Simplify the fractions

17:55.733 --> 17:57.800
before you do anything
else to the equation.

17:57.900 --> 17:59.567
- Okay.

18:01.233 --> 18:03.133
"X" equals 4?
- Correct.

18:03.233 --> 18:05.700
- I did it!
You're a miracle worker!

18:05.800 --> 18:07.767
- You solved
the problem, Cole.

18:07.867 --> 18:09.200
I just gave you a tip.

18:09.300 --> 18:11.133
Now try to solve
problem six.

18:11.233 --> 18:12.967
- I was thinking maybe
we could be done.

18:13.067 --> 18:15.133
You know,
go out on a high note.

18:15.233 --> 18:17.233
We should celebrate.

18:17.333 --> 18:19.067
- I think you need
more practice.

18:19.133 --> 18:20.967
- Yeah, you're right.

18:21.067 --> 18:22.400
I'm thirsty.

18:22.500 --> 18:24.367
Solving that last one
really took it out of me.

18:24.467 --> 18:26.633
- Is dehydration a symptom
of math blockage?

18:26.733 --> 18:28.133
- Yeah, it is.

18:28.233 --> 18:30.467
But nothing a little
juice can't fix.

18:32.833 --> 18:35.433
- There you are.
- Hello, Tammy Gilroy.

18:36.967 --> 18:38.533
- This is for you--

18:38.633 --> 18:41.133
your official
Brain Squad uniform.

18:41.233 --> 18:42.600
- Thank you, Tammy.

18:42.700 --> 18:45.433
- We have so much to go over
to get you up to speed.

18:45.533 --> 18:47.333
Let's get to it.

18:47.433 --> 18:49.733
- Oh, shoot.
Schedule alert.

18:49.833 --> 18:51.833
I have a really important
meeting right now.

18:51.933 --> 18:56.100
Oh, I know, why don't
we go over it at your house?

18:56.200 --> 18:57.333
You know, Friday,
after school?

18:57.433 --> 19:00.067
We could have a sleepover.

19:00.133 --> 19:01.600
- It'll be so fun.

19:01.700 --> 19:03.833
You know, watching movies,
eating snacks...

19:03.933 --> 19:05.433
sharing secrets.

19:05.533 --> 19:07.133
You know, et cetera,
et cetera.

19:07.233 --> 19:08.633
So, what do you say?

19:12.567 --> 19:13.933
- A sleepover
would be enjoyable.

19:18.833 --> 19:20.967
- Will we strike each
other with pillows?

19:21.067 --> 19:23.100
- Why not?
So, we're on?

19:23.200 --> 19:24.367
- I have to ask
mom and dad,

19:24.467 --> 19:25.767
but they seem to
enjoy visitors.

19:25.867 --> 19:27.267
- What are you guys
talking about?

19:27.367 --> 19:28.567
- We're planning
a sleepover at my house

19:28.667 --> 19:29.700
with pillow striking.

19:29.800 --> 19:32.467
- Oh, I love sleepovers!
Can I come?

19:32.567 --> 19:33.467
- Yes.
- No!

19:33.567 --> 19:35.167
- I'll take that as a yes.

19:35.267 --> 19:37.067
- Oh. Hi, Tammy.

19:37.100 --> 19:38.600
Back to work, Frankie?

19:38.700 --> 19:40.133
- Wait.
What's going on?

19:40.233 --> 19:41.333
Back to what work?

19:41.433 --> 19:42.767
- Frankie is tutoring me.

19:42.867 --> 19:45.567
Didn't Ms. Hough
talk to you?

19:45.667 --> 19:47.167
You're off the hook.

19:47.267 --> 19:49.800
- You're not gonna
get away--

19:49.900 --> 19:54.533
I mean, you're not
gonna get a...a way...

19:54.633 --> 19:57.367
to raise Cole's math grade
without his old tests,

19:57.467 --> 20:00.467
you know, so you know
his weaknesses.

20:00.567 --> 20:03.133
I'll get them for you.

20:07.867 --> 20:10.467
Hey! We need to
talk to you about this test.

20:10.567 --> 20:11.533
- What's wrong?

20:11.633 --> 20:13.600
- Cole and Frankie
is what's wrong.

20:13.700 --> 20:15.467
It's fine. I'm fine.

20:15.567 --> 20:17.333
So, finished with
the test?

20:17.433 --> 20:18.967
Who lost?

20:21.033 --> 20:22.267
I did.

20:27.767 --> 20:30.733
- Oh, come on.
- Just deal me a red seven.

20:30.833 --> 20:32.533
- Got it!
- A red seven? Where?

20:32.633 --> 20:34.700
- No. The location.

20:34.800 --> 20:36.833
Are you sure
it's not a volcano?

20:36.933 --> 20:37.833
- Positive.

20:37.933 --> 20:39.900
Mr. Kingston! Mr. Kingston!

20:50.000 --> 20:52.167
Dispatch the extraction
team, immediately.

20:53.200 --> 20:54.567
- What good
is having a robot,

20:54.667 --> 20:56.667
if she's not gonna do all
the annoying work for us?

20:56.767 --> 20:58.267
- Don't think of
Frankie as a robot.

20:58.367 --> 21:00.467
She's your sister.
It's exciting, right?

21:00.567 --> 21:04.633
- Yeah. More chores,
less attention. Yay!

21:04.733 --> 21:06.067
Now that Tammy
and I are friends,

21:06.167 --> 21:08.533
can I have a sleepover with
her and Dayton on Friday night?

21:08.633 --> 21:10.600
- Yes! A high school
sleepover?

21:10.700 --> 21:12.333
Maybe having a sister
is exciting.

21:12.433 --> 21:13.467
I'm in.

21:13.567 --> 21:15.233
- Uh, Frankie, no.
- Aww...

21:15.333 --> 21:16.533
- It's not okay.

21:16.633 --> 21:18.400
Jenny, Frankie sleeps
in a charging pod,

21:18.500 --> 21:20.967
and if this girl, Tammy,
is already suspicious,

21:21.067 --> 21:23.400
we can't run the risk of
her finding out the truth.

21:23.500 --> 21:25.300
- Hmmm...
- What?

21:25.400 --> 21:26.767
I know that look.

21:26.867 --> 21:29.367
- A sleepover is a pretty
normal teenage thing, Sig.

21:29.467 --> 21:31.500
If this girl, Tammy,
is suspicious,

21:31.600 --> 21:34.267
wouldn't cancelling make
her even more suspicious?

21:34.367 --> 21:35.800
- Dad's logic is sound.

21:35.900 --> 21:37.100
Plus...

21:37.200 --> 21:39.267
I have been practicing
my pillow striking technique.

21:40.900 --> 21:43.133
- Too much force?
- Maybe just a little.

21:43.233 --> 21:44.300
- It'll be okay, Mom.

21:44.400 --> 21:45.567
Everyone can sleep
in the living room,

21:45.667 --> 21:47.867
and I'll be there to make
sure everything is okay.

21:47.967 --> 21:50.833
No one's gonna
find out anything.

21:50.933 --> 21:53.200
- Well...

21:54.733 --> 21:57.600
- All right.
- Yay!
