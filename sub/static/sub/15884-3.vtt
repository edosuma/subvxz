00:11.648 --> 00:12.847
- Hey, buddy.
- Hey, my dude.

00:12.881 --> 00:13.980
- What's going on, man?
- Okay, we got the--

00:14.015 --> 00:15.049
It's good to see--
I'm sorry,

00:15.083 --> 00:16.318
I'm talking
at the same time as you.

00:16.353 --> 00:18.191
- Okay, go ahead.
- You go ahead and talk.

00:18.225 --> 00:20.132
- I'm sorry, go ahead.
- No, it's all right, I--

00:20.166 --> 00:22.337
(stammers)

00:22.346 --> 00:23.480
- Go--
- Are you talking right now?

00:23.514 --> 00:26.816
Yeah, I'm trying to--

00:26.850 --> 00:29.253
- Go ahead.
- All right, this is--

00:30.215 --> 00:32.216
- Go ahead.
- Okay, go ahead.

00:33.454 --> 00:35.165
- Try to not--um--
- I'm just--I'm gonna talk

00:35.269 --> 00:36.503
- And you just keep--okay.
- No, it's you.

00:36.537 --> 00:38.104
- I'm sorry.
- No.

00:38.104 --> 00:39.604
- All right, I'll go...
- It's just that my internet

00:39.674 --> 00:41.474
- connection's a little weak--ugh.
- And then you just--gosh.

00:41.543 --> 00:42.843
- Are you talking right now?
- I'm--no.

00:42.878 --> 00:44.212
- Are you talking right now?
- I think--I can't tell

00:44.281 --> 00:45.248
- If it's a delay--
- God damn it.

00:45.317 --> 00:47.987
- [bleep].
- Okay.

00:48.271 --> 00:49.671
- You go first, and speak...
- I'll talk, and then

00:49.706 --> 00:52.308
- You start--no.
- And then--no.

00:53.775 --> 00:55.308
- W-what's that?
- What?

00:55.308 --> 00:57.743
Wait. What?

00:57.812 --> 00:58.948
- [bleep]!
- God damn it!

00:59.017 --> 01:00.252
- I can't [bleep] believe this.
- Not today!

01:00.321 --> 01:02.490
- You got to be kidding me!
- Not [bleep] today!

01:02.525 --> 01:03.524
Ridiculous!

01:03.559 --> 01:05.525
Gotta have
this conversation!

01:05.560 --> 01:07.795
- [bleep]! [bleep]!
- Okay, okay.

01:07.829 --> 01:10.264
Okay, did the delay come back,
Or are you--did you catch up?

01:10.298 --> 01:11.666
You know what?
Let's just lay back, just calm.

01:11.700 --> 01:13.569
You haven't [bleep] caught up,
or we wouldn't be

01:13.603 --> 01:15.170
- talking at the same time.
- Wow.

01:15.205 --> 01:16.872
- God damn it!
- No.

01:16.941 --> 01:18.709
- Okay, listen--okay, listen...
- Okay, here's the thing--

01:18.743 --> 01:20.477
We gotta stop trying
to talk at the same time...

01:20.511 --> 01:21.578
- Let me just get--
- and try to make--

01:21.612 --> 01:23.814
- Okay.
- or this conversation...

01:23.849 --> 01:27.121
- Okay--are--all right, fine.
- It's gonna just go on...

01:27.155 --> 01:28.690
- forever.
- if--I can't get out of it.

01:28.724 --> 01:30.425
- Okay, I can't--listen--
- then that's ridiculous, I'm--

01:30.460 --> 01:33.195
I'm--that--no.

01:33.230 --> 01:35.164
- What a bunch of--
- God, help me, please!

01:35.197 --> 01:36.365
There's only one thing
We can do, okay?

01:36.365 --> 01:37.365
- I can't!
- There's only one thing

01:37.400 --> 01:38.967
- we can do.
- No, listen to me!

01:39.002 --> 01:40.603
- Yeah, we--we got--
- I don't know how to get

01:40.637 --> 01:42.371
- out of this!
- Well, then we got to end it.

01:42.405 --> 01:43.739
- We--I got to end it.
- I got to end this!

01:43.773 --> 01:45.141
- I can't--
- I got to end this!

01:45.174 --> 01:46.575
- I can't do it anymore!
- I can't do it anymore.

01:46.575 --> 01:48.209
- Okay, fine!
- I can't do it anymore!

01:48.244 --> 01:49.944
Then we're gonna end it.

01:49.979 --> 01:51.713
- Okay, we're gonna to end--
- I got to--

01:51.748 --> 01:55.420
K--Keegan?

01:55.454 --> 01:58.223
Keegan, I'm gonna end it.
You're frozen, I can't tell--

01:58.292 --> 02:00.460
We're gonna end it,
Okay?

02:00.495 --> 02:03.263
I just don't want you
to be offended.

02:03.298 --> 02:06.534
Ending it, and--oh!

02:06.568 --> 02:08.269
Oh, he really meant
"end it."

Whoo!

02:33.827 --> 02:37.596
Hello! Mwah!

02:37.631 --> 02:38.731
(audience hooting)

02:38.765 --> 02:42.135
Hello. Hello.

02:42.169 --> 02:45.239
- Thank you.
- Man, thank you.

02:45.273 --> 02:47.308
- Okay, okay.
- Thank you so much.

02:47.342 --> 02:48.443
Thank you so much.

02:48.477 --> 02:50.311
- I am Keegan-Michael Key.
- I am Jordan Peele.

02:50.346 --> 02:51.713
- And we are Key and Peele.
- we are Key and Peele.

02:51.747 --> 02:52.714
Thank you.

02:52.748 --> 02:53.982
(cheers and applause)

02:54.016 --> 02:56.318
You guys see that movie
<i>Django Unchained</i> ?

02:56.352 --> 02:57.419
- Did you see that movie?
- (all) Yeah!

02:57.453 --> 02:58.654
Did you see it?
Okay, mm-hmm.

02:58.688 --> 02:59.888
That movie--
I didn't want to like that,

02:59.923 --> 03:01.623
but that was good, though.
That was good.

03:01.658 --> 03:03.125
(laughs)
'cause I appreciate

03:03.159 --> 03:07.463
some historical, you know,
relevance, and some accuracy,

03:07.497 --> 03:08.731
and when he shot
that bitch and she flew

03:08.765 --> 03:11.100
- across the room--
- And she flew off the thing--

03:11.134 --> 03:13.036
- That's me. That's--that's--
- That was worth $12

03:13.070 --> 03:14.371
Right there,
that one moment.

03:14.405 --> 03:16.206
- But Spike Lee had a problem.
- Yes, he did.

03:16.241 --> 03:18.042
- Before the movie came out--
- Before the movie came out,

03:18.076 --> 03:19.243
before he had seen it,
he was like--

03:19.277 --> 03:22.146
He was like,
"Yo, this is...absolutely"--

03:22.180 --> 03:24.348
I'm like, "Get some coffee
in your system, Spike,

03:24.383 --> 03:26.451
"'cause you've already
lost my attention."

03:26.485 --> 03:27.719
(laughs)

03:27.753 --> 03:29.521
- He didn't like the N-word.
- He didn't like

03:29.555 --> 03:31.490
- the prolific use of the N-word.
- Yeah.

03:31.524 --> 03:34.426
- Which I--I'm trying to think,
How do I describe it?

03:34.460 --> 03:36.795
The N-word--
The use of the N-word in a movie

03:36.829 --> 03:40.366
that's set in slave times,
in the South, in the 1850s.

03:40.400 --> 03:43.303
- "Accurate," is how I would--
- Accurate.

03:46.074 --> 03:48.676
Well,
all right, friends.

03:48.710 --> 03:51.246
The first fight of the evening
will feature

03:51.280 --> 03:54.316
one of my slaves
versus one of the slaves

03:54.350 --> 03:57.486
of my distinguished guest,
Mr. Jacob Dixon.

03:57.520 --> 03:59.154
(chuckles)
You know, Robert,

03:59.188 --> 04:02.891
I hope you're as gracious
a loser as you are a host.

04:02.926 --> 04:04.793
(laughter)

04:04.828 --> 04:08.063
All right, enough talk.
(snaps fingers)

04:10.500 --> 04:14.104
(sighs)
Now...

04:14.138 --> 04:16.439
Fight, you devils!
Fight to the death!

04:16.474 --> 04:18.474
(chuckles)

04:25.282 --> 04:26.849
- Hey.
- Hey.

04:26.883 --> 04:28.851
- Um, question.
- Mm-hmm?

04:28.885 --> 04:29.885
(chuckles)

04:29.920 --> 04:32.922
How do we get
out of this thing alive?

04:32.957 --> 04:35.258
It's really simple.
Just let me pretend to kill you.

04:35.292 --> 04:36.660
Hmm.

04:36.694 --> 04:38.929
Maybe it just makes more sense
if I pretend to kill you.

04:38.963 --> 04:41.832
- Yeah.
- Yeah, I just--

04:41.866 --> 04:44.368
I want to make it
believable, so...

04:44.402 --> 04:46.637
Well, that's what I was--
That's what I was going for too.

04:46.672 --> 04:48.039
- Really?
- What the blazes

04:48.073 --> 04:50.341
is going on over there
in that endless clinch?

04:50.376 --> 04:53.011
Tear him apart!

04:53.045 --> 04:55.614
- Okay, let's--
- Oh! you get--mm!

04:55.648 --> 04:59.017
(both grunting dramatically)

04:59.051 --> 05:00.852
So just--
just die from this.

05:00.886 --> 05:02.987
- From this? Um, just--
- (grunts)

05:03.022 --> 05:05.590
You know what? Just--
Something doesn't feel right,

05:05.624 --> 05:06.991
So if I could just--
If I just--

05:07.026 --> 05:08.460
- Let me--Go with me here.
- Okay. Oh.

05:08.494 --> 05:11.296
Oh.
(both growling)

05:11.330 --> 05:14.165
Yup, that was it, that was it.
This feels much more real.

05:14.200 --> 05:15.967
- So--
- Really? What? Why?

05:16.001 --> 05:17.636
Um, sorry,
What do you mean "Why?"

05:17.670 --> 05:20.005
Fight! My God!

05:21.641 --> 05:22.607
Oh.

05:22.642 --> 05:24.576
I-I'm getting
frustrated now.

05:24.610 --> 05:26.844
Damn it, kill!

05:26.879 --> 05:30.147
(both grunting)

05:30.182 --> 05:31.749
Nope, not a thing.
Not a thing.

05:31.783 --> 05:32.950
Not a thing?
Okay, let me just get--

05:32.985 --> 05:34.352
Mm, I'm gonna get him.
I got him.

05:34.387 --> 05:35.920
- Let me get you, though.
- Just let me get you, though.

05:35.955 --> 05:37.222
- No, let me get you.
- No, let me get you.

05:37.256 --> 05:38.556
It was my idea,
so can I do it first?

05:38.591 --> 05:39.824
- Let me get you.
- Let me get you, though.

05:39.859 --> 05:41.126
- Let me get you.
- Just for, like, a second.

05:41.160 --> 05:42.527
Will you just let me get you
for a second, please?

05:42.562 --> 05:43.795
Let me get you.
Let me get you!

05:43.829 --> 05:47.499
Stop fighting like sissies
and kill each other!

05:47.533 --> 05:48.533
- Okay.
- All right.

05:48.567 --> 05:49.534
(both grunting)

05:49.568 --> 05:50.702
- Okay, check this out.
- Yeah, mm-hmm.

05:50.736 --> 05:51.836
All right,
we'll back up,

05:51.870 --> 05:54.404
- Mm-hmm.
- and you run at me real fast,

05:54.439 --> 05:56.440
just do a bunch of spins,
and kicks, and flourishes,

05:56.474 --> 05:58.508
and I'll just knock you out,
one punch, and then you're dead.

05:58.543 --> 06:00.043
Great, okay--
No, wait, wait, what?

06:00.078 --> 06:02.179
I'm sorry, so you can look cool?
No, thank you.

06:02.213 --> 06:05.182
If someone doesn't die soon,
I will kill you both.

06:05.216 --> 06:06.183
Thank you.

06:06.217 --> 06:08.818
- (grunting) Ah!
- Ohh!

06:08.853 --> 06:10.387
Ah, that's my boy!

06:10.421 --> 06:13.523
- (grunts)
- Ohh!

06:13.558 --> 06:14.558
(grunts)
Ah!

06:14.592 --> 06:16.460
Oh--ahh!

06:16.494 --> 06:18.195
You are not getting stronger
from my punches.

06:18.229 --> 06:20.664
- Yes, I am, though!
- Listen, come here.

06:20.698 --> 06:22.933
You've got to--
No, listen, listen.

06:22.967 --> 06:24.401
Let's be fair, okay?

06:24.435 --> 06:27.070
We both slam into each other,
and we both die.

06:27.105 --> 06:28.672
Fair?

06:28.706 --> 06:29.840
- That's fair.
- All right.

06:29.874 --> 06:31.675
(both grunting)
One!

06:31.709 --> 06:34.044
- This will be good.
- Two!

06:34.078 --> 06:35.946
(both) Three!

06:35.980 --> 06:38.381
(grunting dramatically)

06:38.416 --> 06:40.784
- What?
- Oh, you son of a bitch!

06:40.818 --> 06:42.052
You were never
gonna fall.

06:42.086 --> 06:43.520
You didn't even try
to fall down.

06:43.554 --> 06:45.054
- You were never--
- It's, like, the fakest thing--

06:45.089 --> 06:46.155
The thing is, you're--

06:46.190 --> 06:47.223
- How 'bout that?
- Don't--no.

06:47.257 --> 06:48.424
Don't hit me.
Oh, what's that?

06:48.459 --> 06:50.026
- Ow.
- What are you doing?

06:50.060 --> 06:51.194
- Cut the--
- Come on.

06:51.228 --> 06:52.429
Oh, you hit my balls.

06:52.463 --> 06:53.797
Hey, everybody!

06:53.831 --> 06:57.267
War's over!

06:57.301 --> 07:00.437
Slavery is abolished.

07:00.471 --> 07:01.605
Sorry.

07:01.639 --> 07:03.807
(scoffs)

07:03.842 --> 07:06.510
- We'll call it a draw.
- Done.

07:06.545 --> 07:09.414
Good for you, though, huh?

07:09.448 --> 07:11.616
- Thank you?
- Let's go.

07:11.650 --> 07:14.184
- Well, wait, before you--
- No, no, no, no, no, hold up.

07:14.219 --> 07:16.520
Just--just--if--just if I may,
Who do you think

07:16.554 --> 07:18.656
- would have won the fight?
- Yeah, between the two of us?

07:19.211 --> 07:20.512
(soul music)

07:21.621 --> 07:22.988
We've had,
on a couple of occasions,

07:23.047 --> 07:25.782
like, I mean,
real super-tough,

07:25.817 --> 07:29.919
like, tatted-up Mexican dudes
Walk up to us and go,

07:29.954 --> 07:33.255
"Hey, <i>homes</i>.

07:33.289 --> 07:36.392
"Like, you guys
Should make fun of us."

07:36.426 --> 07:39.495
(laughter and applause)

07:39.530 --> 07:41.163
You know, the guy's, like--
Blink, he's got

07:41.197 --> 07:44.867
a "K" and a "P"
Tattooed here.

07:44.901 --> 07:46.468
- We're like, "No, it's okay."
- "It's all right."

07:46.502 --> 07:47.870
"It's all right."
"No, you should do it.

07:47.904 --> 07:50.505
- "Like, make fun of us more."
- "Nah."

07:50.540 --> 07:52.107
"Because you guys--you guys
are leaving us out."

07:52.141 --> 07:54.610
- You can't--
- "Like, don't leave us out.

07:54.644 --> 07:56.145
"We're trying to have fun too,
okay?"

07:56.179 --> 07:57.279
Yeah.

07:57.314 --> 07:59.982
"We're trying
To have fun, <i>ese</i>."

08:00.017 --> 08:01.985
That's some scary [bleep],
when their eyes get big.

08:02.019 --> 08:03.119
- That's some scary [bleep].
- "Hey."

08:03.154 --> 08:04.821
No.

08:04.855 --> 08:06.556
I don't want none of that.

08:06.590 --> 08:09.959
It's like, if you have
human sacrifice in your DNA,

08:09.994 --> 08:12.895
- I'm not gonna make fun of you.
- (laughs)

08:15.765 --> 08:17.633
Okay,
let's get this thing going.

08:17.667 --> 08:20.736
Everybody take a seat.

08:20.771 --> 08:23.807
We got to have
More meetings, <i>homes</i>,

08:23.841 --> 08:26.576
'cause I'm telling you, man,
we got to get organized.

08:26.610 --> 08:28.244
(sighs)

08:28.279 --> 08:32.616
(police sirens in the distance)

08:38.889 --> 08:41.657
Carlito ain't got a seat, man.
Someone get him a chair.

08:41.692 --> 08:43.092
No, I'm cool.

08:43.126 --> 08:45.795
No, dude, get him a chair,
h <i>omes</i>.

08:48.867 --> 08:50.668
I'm gonna sit gangster.

08:50.702 --> 08:53.404
But, Carlito, it doesn't look
Like it's comfortable, man.

08:53.438 --> 08:56.006
Why don't you
Just sit in the chair?

08:56.041 --> 08:58.242
I never sit
in no chair, <i>ese</i>.

08:58.276 --> 09:00.110
Mm-mmm.

09:00.145 --> 09:03.880
You never, ever gon' catch me
sitting in no chairs.

09:03.914 --> 09:05.781
Hey, <i>ese</i>, you know that
That's <i>loco</i>, right?

09:05.816 --> 09:07.383
No, man.
(scoffs)

09:07.417 --> 09:08.618
It's cool, Carlito.

09:08.652 --> 09:10.319
No one's gonna think
you're soft

09:10.354 --> 09:11.954
- if you sit in a chair, <i>homes</i>.
- Yeah, yeah.

09:11.989 --> 09:13.490
- We're all sitting in chairs.
- Right.

09:13.524 --> 09:15.759
- Bunch of bitch-ass <i>culeros</i>.

09:15.794 --> 09:17.427
- <i>Ã¿Que?</i>
- I don't have no time

09:17.462 --> 09:19.963
to sit in no [bleep] chair.

09:22.133 --> 09:24.301
Okay.

09:24.335 --> 09:26.937
Now that we're all here--

09:26.971 --> 09:28.472
You know what?
But why, though?

09:28.506 --> 09:31.375
Like, it don't make no sense
for you to set yourself up

09:31.409 --> 09:32.943
with a rule like that.

09:32.977 --> 09:35.812
- No, it's, like, limiting.
- Yeah, limiting.

09:35.847 --> 09:37.214
- Limiting.
- I mean, sometimes,

09:37.248 --> 09:38.649
People sit in chairs.

09:38.683 --> 09:41.518
Man, [bleep] all of you guys
with your bitch-ass chairs.

09:41.552 --> 09:43.320
(wood cracks)

09:43.354 --> 09:46.923
- There.
- (scoffs)

09:46.958 --> 09:50.628
Okay, Carlito, quit playing
and sit in the chair, <i>pendejo</i>.

09:50.662 --> 09:52.196
- No.
- Carlito,

09:52.230 --> 09:55.299
we have to have this meeting
now, <i>ese</i>. Get up!

09:55.334 --> 09:56.901
I'm good right here, man.

09:56.935 --> 09:58.635
- You know--
- I'm chilling.

09:58.670 --> 10:00.904
Go ahead with your meeting.

10:00.938 --> 10:03.907
Okay, but you know
It's going to be weird.

10:03.942 --> 10:05.275
You don't care
that it's going to be weird?

10:05.310 --> 10:06.410
Weird for you, maybe.

10:06.444 --> 10:08.779
He doesn't care.
Okay.

10:08.814 --> 10:12.016
Okay, homies,
so this is what we have to do,

10:12.051 --> 10:13.684
like, we got to sell
more drugs...

10:13.719 --> 10:15.052
- (groaning)
- and we got to make

10:15.086 --> 10:16.420
more crimes happen.

10:16.454 --> 10:19.323
- Roberto, where are we--
- (groaning)

10:19.357 --> 10:21.559
Carlito,
You're bleeding, ese!

10:21.593 --> 10:24.227
(grunts)
Who cares, man?

10:24.262 --> 10:27.864
(winces)

10:27.899 --> 10:29.700
Yo, whoa!
You just got shanked, man!

10:29.734 --> 10:32.002
- We got to pull that out!
- Leave it!

10:32.036 --> 10:34.471
I'm chilling, homes.

10:34.506 --> 10:37.875
I don't care
about that stupid shank.

10:37.910 --> 10:40.244
(groaning)

10:40.279 --> 10:41.446
(exhales)

10:41.480 --> 10:43.248
Carlito.

10:43.282 --> 10:45.784
Carlito, wake up, man!

10:45.818 --> 10:49.154
(radio chatter)

10:49.188 --> 10:50.588
Hey,
don't even bother, <i>ese</i>.

10:50.623 --> 10:52.023
What?
(screams)

10:52.057 --> 10:53.591
<i>Ã‚Â¡Oh, dios mio!</i>

10:53.626 --> 10:56.461
I don't need
those defibrillators.

10:56.495 --> 10:58.663
I don't even want to come back
to life, homes.

10:58.697 --> 11:02.166
Carlito,
Go back into your body.

11:02.200 --> 11:05.069
- My body's stupid, <i>homes</i>.
- What?

11:05.103 --> 11:07.571
I'm fine right here
on the spirit plane.

11:07.606 --> 11:09.974
Life is for pussies.

11:10.008 --> 11:14.078
(heavenly singing)

11:14.113 --> 11:18.149
Carlito.
Carlito, go to the light.

11:18.184 --> 11:19.818
Nah, I'm good, man.

11:19.852 --> 11:21.486
Carlito,
that's Heaven, man.

11:21.520 --> 11:23.188
I don't need to go
to Heaven, <i>homes</i>.

11:23.222 --> 11:25.791
- Heaven is for pussies.
- Oh, boy.

11:27.694 --> 11:31.129
Hello, and welcome
To the fifth annual meeting

11:31.164 --> 11:33.098
of the Tallahassee
Black Republicans.

11:33.133 --> 11:35.167
- Now, I'm pissed!
- (All) Mm-hmm.

11:35.201 --> 11:37.169
- Royally pissed!
- (all) Mm-hmm.

11:37.204 --> 11:42.175
Last november, Barack Obama
was re-elected President,

11:42.209 --> 11:45.345
and the black vote
went almost entirely to him!

11:45.379 --> 11:46.679
(crowd murmuring)
Dagnabbit.

11:46.714 --> 11:50.550
We're not getting
our message out, obviously.

11:50.585 --> 11:53.953
The Republican Party
is and should be

11:53.987 --> 11:56.555
- the only home for black votes.
- Yes, sir.

11:56.590 --> 12:00.559
Now, people think that
black voters are a monolith.

12:00.594 --> 12:02.194
(scoffs)
We're not a monolith.

12:02.228 --> 12:03.829
- What? What?
- No, we're not.

12:03.863 --> 12:05.697
- In fact,
Black Republicans alone

12:05.731 --> 12:07.565
are an extremely diverse
group of people.

12:07.600 --> 12:09.334
(crowd murmuring agreement)

12:09.368 --> 12:11.035
Now, to speak more
on diversity,

12:11.070 --> 12:15.640
I present tonight's speaker,

12:15.674 --> 12:16.708
Mr. Douglas Jackson.

12:16.742 --> 12:22.747
(applause)

12:27.787 --> 12:29.621
(applause ends abruptly)

12:31.124 --> 12:32.624
Now, I'm not gonna
sugarcoat it, I'm pissed!

12:32.659 --> 12:33.625
(crowd murmuring agreement)

12:33.660 --> 12:35.927
I'm royally pissed.

12:35.962 --> 12:39.063
The liberal media
thinks that Republicanism

12:39.098 --> 12:40.865
- is not for black people.
- (all) Mm.

12:40.899 --> 12:44.135
- Now, you tell me, what
about fiscal responsibility,

12:44.169 --> 12:46.970
a strong national defense,
and a limited government

12:47.005 --> 12:49.539
is unappealing
to black people?

12:49.574 --> 12:51.875
- We're not a monolith!
- (all) Mm-mmm.

12:51.910 --> 12:54.311
We come in all different
shapes and sizes.

12:54.346 --> 12:55.913
- We do.
- (all) Mm-hmm.

12:55.947 --> 12:57.915
Now, who here would like
to come up to this podium

12:57.950 --> 13:00.618
and speak about the diversity
amongst Black Republicans?

13:00.652 --> 13:02.386
(clears throat)

13:02.421 --> 13:04.155
Oh.
(chuckles)

13:04.190 --> 13:05.590
Gentlemen,
we have a real treat today,

13:05.624 --> 13:08.393
a gentleman
who is a little bit eccentric,

13:08.427 --> 13:12.196
a little bit outside of the box,
if you will,

13:12.230 --> 13:14.664
but I can't think
of a better person to speak

13:14.698 --> 13:17.167
on diversity
amongst Black Republicans

13:17.201 --> 13:18.268
than this gentleman
right here.

13:18.302 --> 13:19.970
All the way from Orlando,
my good friend,

13:20.004 --> 13:21.404
Arthur Washington!

13:21.439 --> 13:25.909
(applause)

13:25.944 --> 13:27.278
It's good to see you.
It's good to see you.

13:27.312 --> 13:29.413
Good to see you, man.

13:29.448 --> 13:32.082
(applause)

13:32.117 --> 13:33.150
(applause ends abruptly)

13:33.184 --> 13:34.285
Thank you
for the introduction,

13:34.319 --> 13:35.452
Brother Douglas.

13:35.487 --> 13:36.987
Thank you for being here,
Brother Arthur.

13:37.021 --> 13:38.321
Mm-hmm.

13:38.356 --> 13:41.124
However, I am...
pissed.

13:41.158 --> 13:42.158
(crowd murmuring agreement)

13:42.192 --> 13:43.860
Royally pissed.

13:43.894 --> 13:45.128
- Indeed, indeed!
- All right.

13:45.162 --> 13:46.429
- Democrats think
they have the right

13:46.463 --> 13:48.230
to all the black people.

13:48.265 --> 13:49.599
But that is not the case.

13:49.633 --> 13:51.968
We are not a monolith.
(crowd murmuring agreement)

13:52.003 --> 13:56.140
Democrats may be cool,
but they ain't practical.

13:56.174 --> 13:57.307
There you go.
(crowd murmuring agreement)

13:57.342 --> 13:59.276
Republicans
are practical.

13:59.310 --> 14:02.145
Black people
are practical!

14:02.179 --> 14:04.847
- Come to think of it...
- Get those pants.

14:04.882 --> 14:07.316
I think Black Republicans
are pretty cool.

14:07.351 --> 14:08.551
(crowd murmuring agreement)
Hear, hear, hear, hear.

14:08.585 --> 14:10.220
Not to mention
very diverse.

14:10.254 --> 14:11.555
There we go. Mm-hmm.
(door opens)

14:11.589 --> 14:14.124
Excuse me, gentlemen.
Sorry to interrupt.

14:14.159 --> 14:16.927
Someone's white wife
is here to pick them up.

14:16.962 --> 14:20.030
(all murmuring)

14:20.064 --> 14:21.765
Was her name Emily?

14:21.799 --> 14:23.734
- Uh, she was white.
- Oh, great, that's--

14:25.286 --> 14:26.719
(soul music)

14:26.854 --> 14:28.821
Anybody here enjoy
athletics and sports?

14:28.856 --> 14:29.989
(cheers and applause)

14:30.024 --> 14:32.526
Something that
we find very interesting

14:32.560 --> 14:33.961
is that sometimes,
the celebrations

14:33.995 --> 14:35.596
after somebody
has done something positive

14:35.630 --> 14:37.031
in a sporting event
are more violent

14:37.065 --> 14:38.232
- than the sport itself.
- They're just--

14:38.267 --> 14:39.967
- They're so jacked up.
- Why is that?

14:40.002 --> 14:41.703
Yeah!
They're so amped up!

14:41.737 --> 14:43.171
They're crazy.
They're just--

14:43.205 --> 14:44.405
- Dudes get amped up!
- We did that, man.

14:44.440 --> 14:45.706
- We won that!
- We done--yeah.

14:45.741 --> 14:46.974
- We won that!
- Yeah, we did.

14:47.009 --> 14:48.375
- We won that, son!
- You did that stuff, boy.

14:48.410 --> 14:49.376
- What? What?
- You did it, son.

14:49.411 --> 14:50.811
- We won that, son!
- We won that!

14:50.845 --> 14:52.346
They thought we couldn't do it,
but we could do it!

14:52.380 --> 14:54.148
(both yelling unintelligibly)

14:54.182 --> 14:55.849
- We did it, son!
- We did it--yeah!

14:55.884 --> 14:56.850
We did it, man!

14:56.884 --> 14:59.653
(unintelligible yelling)

14:59.687 --> 15:01.521
Come on, man!
We did it!

15:01.556 --> 15:03.423
- We did it!
- We did it.

15:03.458 --> 15:06.627
Silence it.
We did it.

15:06.661 --> 15:08.929
We did it.

15:08.963 --> 15:11.165
We did it--oh.

15:11.199 --> 15:12.766
We did it.

15:13.902 --> 15:17.338
(cheering and mixed chatter)

15:17.372 --> 15:19.873
(laughs)
Oh, yeah!

15:19.908 --> 15:22.175
Good victory, guys!
Good victory!

15:22.210 --> 15:24.445
Hey, hey, come on, good game!
Slap-ass, man!

15:24.479 --> 15:25.446
Hey, good game!

15:25.480 --> 15:27.848
Get some slap-ass!
(laughs)

15:27.883 --> 15:30.084
Yeah, dog!
Yes, man!

15:30.119 --> 15:32.520
Good game!
Slap-ass!

15:32.554 --> 15:34.321
(laughs)

15:34.356 --> 15:36.223
Hey, who's next? Who--

15:36.257 --> 15:39.125
Hey, Garcia!
Come on, man, get you some.

15:39.160 --> 15:40.860
Come on, let's get
some slap-ass over here.

15:40.894 --> 15:42.995
No!

15:43.029 --> 15:45.297
What? Why--why not?

15:45.332 --> 15:48.134
I said no, Rafi.

15:48.168 --> 15:50.669
He's had enough, Rafi.

15:50.704 --> 15:53.072
We've all had enough.

15:53.106 --> 15:54.607
Enough of what?

15:54.641 --> 15:57.009
Enough of the damn
ass-slapping, Rafi.

15:57.044 --> 16:00.113
<i>Gracias.</i>

16:00.147 --> 16:01.581
The [bleep] slap-ass?

16:01.615 --> 16:03.316
- Si, yes. si.
- Mm-hmm.

16:03.350 --> 16:04.450
(laughs)

16:04.484 --> 16:07.853
Guys, who [bleep] cares
how much I slap ass?

16:07.887 --> 16:09.554
So what?
I slap ass!

16:09.589 --> 16:13.158
No big deal, man.
I'm a [bleep] baseball player.

16:13.193 --> 16:15.761
That's what we do.
We [bleep] hit home runs,

16:15.795 --> 16:18.664
and [bleep] slap ass.
Come on, huh?

16:18.698 --> 16:21.500
Rafi, that's not
how we all see baseball.

16:21.534 --> 16:25.071
Everybody does it.
All the teams slap ass, man.

16:25.105 --> 16:27.506
You--
You slap ass, Garcia!

16:27.541 --> 16:29.274
Like, a couple of times
a game.

16:29.309 --> 16:31.176
(laugh sheepishly)

16:31.210 --> 16:32.644
What?
So what, man?

16:32.678 --> 16:34.312
Why the [bleep]
you counting, man?

16:34.346 --> 16:36.481
Who knows how many times
I slap ass, or how many--

16:36.515 --> 16:39.518
427 times.

16:42.455 --> 16:44.756
Okay, time flies when
you're having fun, man. What--

16:44.790 --> 16:48.027
My families come
to these games, Rafi.

16:48.061 --> 16:49.896
My son is always asking me

16:49.930 --> 16:52.398
why I'm letting this man
touch my butt so many times.

16:52.433 --> 16:55.234
And you say "slap-ass"
every time.

16:55.268 --> 16:56.735
Every time!

16:56.770 --> 17:01.106
Okay, hold on one second.
Let's go to the time-out.

17:01.141 --> 17:04.676
I'm from
the Dominican Republic, okay?

17:04.711 --> 17:08.881
All I know,
since I was a little kid,

17:08.915 --> 17:11.684
is to catch fly balls
and to say "Slap-ass"

17:11.718 --> 17:14.686
every single time
I [bleep] slap ass!

17:14.721 --> 17:16.222
This is the Major Leagues,
Rafi.

17:16.256 --> 17:18.457
We are all from
the Dominican Republic.

17:18.492 --> 17:23.662
Nobody here has ever heard
anyone say "Slap-ass"

17:23.696 --> 17:26.031
before you.

17:26.066 --> 17:27.766
Quit playing, man.
Come on, get your slap-ass.

17:27.800 --> 17:31.738
- (all) Rafi!
- Rafi, enough! Okay?

17:35.943 --> 17:39.545
I'm...
(sighs)

17:39.580 --> 17:45.051
Okay.
You're right.

17:45.085 --> 17:49.889
I know you're right about it.

17:49.923 --> 17:52.825
I have a problem, okay?

17:52.860 --> 17:56.362
I know that.

17:56.397 --> 17:58.598
And I decide to stop
right now.

17:58.632 --> 18:00.300
Bueno.

18:00.334 --> 18:02.535
(sighs)

18:02.570 --> 18:04.271
Right after I get
that Garcia slap-ass.

18:04.305 --> 18:05.872
- Come on.
- (all) Hey, hey, hey!

18:05.907 --> 18:07.207
- What?
- No, Rafi!

18:07.241 --> 18:09.009
Hey, come on, eh?

18:09.043 --> 18:11.344
I'm fine, all right?
Fine, I get it!

18:11.379 --> 18:13.380
(sighs)

18:14.815 --> 18:16.416
(all struggling)
Get up out of here!

18:16.450 --> 18:18.018
- Come on!
- Get out of the locker room!

18:18.052 --> 18:19.353
You get out
of the locker room!

18:19.387 --> 18:21.855
You're the only slap-ass
that matters, Garcia!

18:21.890 --> 18:24.892
You are not
getting a slap-ass!

18:26.595 --> 18:29.263
Hey, Garcia, man,
can I talk to you for a second?

18:29.297 --> 18:30.964
- Oh.
- Hold up.

18:30.998 --> 18:32.965
Hey, Rafi, what's up?

18:33.000 --> 18:37.070
Oh, man, I just talked
To the manager, man.

18:37.104 --> 18:38.871
He says he's going
to trade me, man.

18:38.906 --> 18:42.642
I mean, what the hell, you know?
I got kids, too, right?

18:42.676 --> 18:44.477
Yeah, well, we all told you
what was going to happen

18:44.511 --> 18:46.980
- If you--
- Hey...

18:47.014 --> 18:48.815
(heavy breathing)

18:48.849 --> 18:51.185
I really could use
that one slap-ass, man.

18:51.219 --> 18:53.620
- Rafi.
- Come on, man.

18:53.654 --> 18:57.223
Just one slap-ass, you know?
Just one--

18:57.258 --> 19:00.727
Just for old times' sake,
you know?

19:00.761 --> 19:03.296
Get me back on my feet.
I really--

19:03.330 --> 19:07.301
Just one for the road, man.
I could really use it.

19:07.335 --> 19:12.139
(heavy breathing)

19:13.742 --> 19:16.744
Okay, okay.

19:18.546 --> 19:21.715
Good game! Slap-ass!
(loud smack)

19:21.749 --> 19:23.617
(relieved sigh)

19:23.651 --> 19:25.085
I got to get home
to my kids.

19:25.119 --> 19:26.786
Okay.

19:26.821 --> 19:31.024
Oh.
Garcia, man.

19:31.058 --> 19:33.460
I'll suck your [bleep] if you
let me slap your ass again.

19:33.494 --> 19:36.763
No!
(groans)

19:36.797 --> 19:39.299
Garcia,
I'll suck your [bleep].

19:39.333 --> 19:42.869
(groaning)

19:42.903 --> 19:45.772
Ohh, slap-ass, slap-ass,
slap-ass, slap-ass, slap-ass,

19:45.807 --> 19:48.575
slap-ass, slap-ass.

19:49.469 --> 19:50.836
(soul music)

19:55.907 --> 19:57.808
Welcome
to Metta World News.

19:57.842 --> 19:59.909
In fashion,
if you woke up, and there

19:59.944 --> 20:02.612
was a 4-inch miniature human
standing on your chest,

20:02.646 --> 20:04.047
would you swat them off?

20:04.081 --> 20:06.248
I was really challenged
by this question.

20:06.283 --> 20:08.984
I would hope that I would
engage them in conversation.

20:09.019 --> 20:12.722
But in reality,
I think I'd be scared of them

20:12.756 --> 20:15.791
and swat them away,
which would probably kill them.

20:15.826 --> 20:17.860
Well, that wraps up
Metta World News

20:17.894 --> 20:21.297
for this Wednesday, October
Noise-canceling Octagon Tire.

20:21.331 --> 20:24.334
I'm Metta World Peace.
Good night.

20:25.503 --> 20:28.271
Did I fulfill my contract,
Satan?

20:28.306 --> 20:29.773
(cheers and applause)

20:29.807 --> 20:33.243
We love you.
Thank you.

20:33.277 --> 20:34.811
- Hey, it was a good show, man.
- It was a good show!

20:34.845 --> 20:36.312
- We won that show, dog!
- Yeah, we did!

20:36.347 --> 20:37.447
- We won that show, baby!
- Yeah, we did!

20:37.481 --> 20:38.447
- We won that show!
- What?

20:38.482 --> 20:39.814
- We won that show!
- We did!

20:39.986 --> 20:41.986
- We won that show.
- Come on-- (unintelligible)

20:43.681 --> 20:45.681
(cheers and applause)
