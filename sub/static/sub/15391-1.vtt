07:51.346 --> 07:55.942
In the last century, before the birth
of the new faith called Christianity,

07:56.016 --> 07:59.043
which was destined to overthrow
the pagan tyranny of Rome

07:59.119 --> 08:01.417
and bring about a new society,

08:01.487 --> 08:05.617
the Roman Republic stood at the
very center of the civilized world.

08:06.425 --> 08:09.190
"Of all things fairest,"
sang the poet,

08:09.261 --> 08:13.720
"first among cities and home
of the gods is golden Rome. "

08:13.798 --> 08:16.493
Yet, even at the zenith
of her pride and power

08:16.566 --> 08:19.627
the Republic lay fatally
stricken with a disease

08:19.703 --> 08:21.671
called human slavery.

08:22.271 --> 08:24.831
The age of the dictator
was at hand

08:24.907 --> 08:28.365
waiting in the shadows for
the event to bring it forth.

08:29.210 --> 08:31.144
In that same century,

08:31.212 --> 08:33.942
in the conquered
Greek province of Thrace,

08:34.014 --> 08:37.416
an illiterate slave woman
added to her master's wealth

08:37.484 --> 08:41.784
by giving birth to a son
whom she named Spartacus.

08:41.854 --> 08:44.254
A proud, rebellious son

08:44.322 --> 08:47.485
who was sold to living death
in the mines of Libya

08:47.559 --> 08:49.890
before
his thirteenth birthday.

08:50.561 --> 08:54.122
There, under whip
and chain and sun,

08:54.198 --> 08:57.189
he lived out his youth
and his young manhood,

08:57.267 --> 08:59.497
dreaming the death of slavery

08:59.569 --> 09:02.936
2,иии years before
it finally would die.

09:45.806 --> 09:47.297
Back to work!

09:48.208 --> 09:49.699
Back to work!

09:55.315 --> 09:58.078
Get up, Spartacus,
you Thracian dog!

09:58.150 --> 10:00.983
Come on, get up!
Get up! Get...

10:01.720 --> 10:04.211
Oh, my ankle!
My ankle!

10:05.690 --> 10:07.385
My ankle!

10:10.760 --> 10:12.626
Guard! Guard!

10:16.332 --> 10:19.459
Spartacus again, huh?
Well, this time he dies.

10:20.168 --> 10:22.694
Move along!
Back to work, all of you!

10:42.386 --> 10:43.945
Welcome,
Lentulus Batiatus.

10:44.021 --> 10:45.853
Welcome, indeed,
my dear Captain.

10:50.727 --> 10:54.560
Oh, 11 miles through
this disastrous heat

10:54.629 --> 10:57.497
and the cost of hiring
an escort, ruinous.

10:58.733 --> 11:01.395
Even so, I warrant you have
nothing fit to sell me,

11:01.469 --> 11:02.800
have you, Captain?

11:02.870 --> 11:05.304
I've wasted both
my time and my money.

11:05.372 --> 11:06.566
Tell me the truth.

11:06.639 --> 11:09.107
We have a few
you might be interested in.

11:09.174 --> 11:11.837
These? Carrion.

11:11.910 --> 11:13.902
The buzzards are late.

11:13.979 --> 11:16.504
This one's not bad.
He's a Gaul.

11:16.581 --> 11:19.107
I don't like Gauls.
Hairy.

11:21.351 --> 11:23.012
Can he come down
unassisted?

11:23.086 --> 11:24.554
Come down,
you.

11:25.488 --> 11:26.853
Come down!

11:31.626 --> 11:34.152
Be good enough
to show me the teeth.

11:34.229 --> 11:35.628
Open your mouth.

11:35.697 --> 11:37.061
Thank you.

11:39.199 --> 11:42.464
Yes, as the teeth go,
so go the bones.

11:42.535 --> 11:46.529
This mouth
is really impermissible.

11:46.606 --> 11:47.970
The fellow's
made of chalk.

11:48.040 --> 11:50.167
We have
many others.

11:55.679 --> 11:59.308
The sun's over there.
I have to pay these people.

12:01.384 --> 12:02.613
Who's that?

12:02.685 --> 12:04.482
This one's a
Thracian.

12:04.553 --> 12:05.952
I'm making an example
of him.

12:06.021 --> 12:07.113
How?

12:07.189 --> 12:08.554
Starve him to death.

12:08.624 --> 12:11.490
It's the only thing
that impresses slaves.

12:11.559 --> 12:13.186
What a pity.

12:16.329 --> 12:18.594
He reacts.
Good muscle tone.

12:19.666 --> 12:21.929
Can I see
his teeth?

12:22.001 --> 12:24.128
Open your mouth,
Spartacus.

12:24.970 --> 12:27.802
You smell
like a rhinoceros.

12:30.241 --> 12:32.641
Captain, the teeth. You
asked him to open his mouth.

12:32.709 --> 12:34.268
He doesn't
obey you?

12:34.344 --> 12:36.313
His teeth are
the best thing about him.

12:36.380 --> 12:38.780
He hamstrung a guard with them
not more than an hour ago.

12:38.848 --> 12:42.751
Marvelous. I wish I'd
been here. I'll take him.

12:42.819 --> 12:44.786
Let's look
at some of the others.

12:51.759 --> 12:53.158
Come along.

13:55.777 --> 13:57.040
In spite of
sickness and death,

13:57.112 --> 13:59.240
we will profit
11,000 sesterces.

13:59.915 --> 14:02.246
Including your commission,
of course.

14:02.316 --> 14:05.343
Oh, no, sir.
Without my commission.

14:08.722 --> 14:10.588
Marcellus,
there they are.

14:10.657 --> 14:13.125
They're a dirty-looking lot,
but it's the best I could find.

14:13.192 --> 14:16.127
No one else could have made
so fine a choice.

14:21.199 --> 14:22.792
Slaves,

14:22.867 --> 14:26.996
you have arrived at the gladiatorial
school of Lentulus Batiatus.

14:27.070 --> 14:29.061
You'll be trained
by experts

14:29.138 --> 14:30.936
to fight in pairs
to the death.

14:31.007 --> 14:34.204
You won't fight
to the death here.

14:34.277 --> 14:36.244
That will be
after you've been sold

14:36.311 --> 14:38.279
and then for ladies
and gentlemen of quality,

14:38.346 --> 14:40.974
for those who appreciate
a fine kill.

14:42.349 --> 14:45.615
A gladiator's like a stallion,
he must be pampered.

14:45.852 --> 14:47.979
You'll be oiled, bathed,

14:48.054 --> 14:52.183
shaved, massaged,
taught to use your heads.

14:53.592 --> 14:57.289
A good body with a dull brain
is as cheap as life itself.

14:57.361 --> 14:59.455
You'll be given
your ceremonial caudas.

14:59.530 --> 15:01.624
Marcellus, please.
There.

15:02.866 --> 15:04.561
Be proud of them.

15:04.634 --> 15:08.593
On special occasions,
those who please me

15:08.671 --> 15:12.198
will even be given the
companionship of a young lady.

15:13.641 --> 15:16.076
Approximately
half our graduates

15:16.144 --> 15:19.579
live for five, 10,
10 years.

15:19.980 --> 15:24.042
Some even attain freedom and
become trainers themselves.

15:24.117 --> 15:25.675
Marcellus.

15:26.519 --> 15:27.952
I congratulate you.

15:28.020 --> 15:30.989
And may fortune smile
on most of you.

15:36.260 --> 15:39.127
Marcellus, watch the second
from the right.

15:39.196 --> 15:42.290
He's a Thracian. They were going to
kill him for hamstringing a guard.

15:42.365 --> 15:43.423
We'll break him of that.

15:43.499 --> 15:45.968
Don't overdo it.
He has quality.

15:52.740 --> 15:53.866
Next.

16:00.947 --> 16:02.039
Next.

16:09.721 --> 16:11.086
I like you.

16:12.724 --> 16:14.816
I want you
to be my friend.

16:16.260 --> 16:18.251
I want to be
your friend.

16:19.062 --> 16:22.088
All I ask is that
you get along with me.

16:24.667 --> 16:26.634
What's your name,
slave?

16:27.636 --> 16:28.967
Spartacus.

16:30.839 --> 16:32.829
I feel
you don't like me.

16:39.278 --> 16:41.042
Give him your sword.

16:44.650 --> 16:45.878
Take it!

16:53.457 --> 16:56.050
I have a feeling
you want to kill me.

16:57.694 --> 17:00.389
This is the only chance
you'll ever get.

17:00.829 --> 17:02.058
Kill me.

17:03.532 --> 17:05.431
Don't be afraid,
slave.

17:06.134 --> 17:07.931
You have
that sword.

17:08.469 --> 17:10.767
I only have
this piece of wood.

17:13.674 --> 17:15.800
Are you
going to disobey me?

17:20.546 --> 17:22.069
Take his sword.

17:24.115 --> 17:26.209
You're not as stupid
as I thought.

17:26.284 --> 17:28.512
You might even
be intelligent.

17:28.686 --> 17:30.813
That's dangerous for slaves.

17:31.922 --> 17:33.389
You just remember,

17:33.823 --> 17:36.656
from now on everything
you do I'll be watching.

18:08.618 --> 18:10.587
You did
the right thing.

18:11.188 --> 18:15.249
Every once in a while Marcellus
likes to kill a man as an example.

18:15.624 --> 18:19.185
I think he's picked you.
Better watch him.

18:22.730 --> 18:24.630
How long
have you been here?

18:24.698 --> 18:25.995
Six months.

18:26.066 --> 18:27.898
I wish
he'd pick me.

18:27.968 --> 18:31.267
I want one chance at that
pig before they carry me out!

18:31.337 --> 18:33.533
Quiet!
No talking down there.

18:35.140 --> 18:38.838
Dionysius, you'll get us in
trouble just like in the mines.

18:44.582 --> 18:46.208
What's your name?

18:47.250 --> 18:49.548
You don't want to know
my name.

18:49.786 --> 18:52.083
I don't want to know
your name.

18:53.088 --> 18:55.079
Just
a friendly question.

18:55.224 --> 18:57.453
Gladiators
don't make friends.

18:57.658 --> 19:00.560
If we're ever matched
in the arena together,

19:00.628 --> 19:02.493
I'll have to
kill you.

19:31.286 --> 19:32.447
Helena

19:34.689 --> 19:36.088
with Galino.

19:40.593 --> 19:41.856
Patricia,

19:44.130 --> 19:45.325
Crixus.

19:48.300 --> 19:49.631
Priscilla,

19:52.403 --> 19:53.564
David.

19:58.141 --> 19:59.370
Claudia,

20:00.744 --> 20:01.938
Pharox.

20:07.016 --> 20:08.278
Varinia,

20:09.517 --> 20:10.814
Dionysius.

20:10.885 --> 20:12.478
No, no.
Spartacus.

20:15.656 --> 20:16.987
Spartacus.

20:21.093 --> 20:22.322
Felicia...

21:32.151 --> 21:34.052
I've never
had a woman.

21:59.841 --> 22:02.810
You have one now, Spartacus.
You must take her.

22:02.877 --> 22:05.106
Go away.
What will she think of you?

22:05.178 --> 22:06.771
Indeed,
what will I think of you?

22:06.847 --> 22:08.371
Go away.

22:09.182 --> 22:11.207
Come, come.
Be generous.

22:11.284 --> 22:13.013
We must learn
to share our pleasures.

22:15.554 --> 22:17.920
I'm not an animal!

22:17.989 --> 22:21.289
You're not trying to escape,
by any chance?

22:21.359 --> 22:24.260
Direct your courage
to the girl, Spartacus.

22:26.964 --> 22:28.761
I'm not an animal!

22:34.403 --> 22:36.599
I'm not an animal.

22:36.672 --> 22:38.162
Neither am I.

23:15.236 --> 23:16.898
What's your name?

23:19.573 --> 23:20.802
Varinia.

23:23.676 --> 23:25.975
You'll have to take her
out of here, Marcellus.

23:26.045 --> 23:27.672
You may not be an animal,
Spartacus,

23:27.747 --> 23:32.081
but this sorry show gives me little
hope that you'll ever be a man.

25:18.337 --> 25:22.364
First rule, you get
an instant kill on the red.

25:22.708 --> 25:25.074
Here, here.

25:26.644 --> 25:28.976
Always remember,
go for the red first.

25:29.046 --> 25:30.673
If you don't,
your opponent will.

25:31.781 --> 25:34.114
In the blue,
you get a cripple.

25:34.184 --> 25:37.641
Here, here,

25:37.719 --> 25:39.654
here and here.

25:40.422 --> 25:41.822
Second rule,

25:42.056 --> 25:44.821
go for the cripple
before the slow kill.

25:45.326 --> 25:47.726
Here's a slow kill
on the yellow.

25:48.095 --> 25:51.895
Here, here
and here.

25:52.732 --> 25:54.097
Remember,

25:54.533 --> 25:56.399
a slow kill may have
enough left in him

25:56.469 --> 25:58.164
to kill you
before he dies.

25:58.803 --> 26:00.237
With a cripple,
you know you've got him

26:00.305 --> 26:02.296
if you keep your distance
and wear him down.

26:02.373 --> 26:05.274
The rest is all right for
a public spectacle in Rome,

26:05.342 --> 26:06.537
but here at Capua

26:06.610 --> 26:08.476
we expect more
than simple butchery

26:08.545 --> 26:10.035
and we get it.

26:12.048 --> 26:15.449
Spartacus, why are you
looking at that girl?

26:16.852 --> 26:19.844
Varinia! Stand still.

26:25.092 --> 26:27.492
Since all you can do
is look at girls,

26:28.128 --> 26:31.495
all right, slave,
go ahead and look.

26:33.065 --> 26:34.658
I said, look.

27:16.334 --> 27:19.667
No. No, this one goes
to the Spaniard.

27:26.943 --> 27:29.468
Have a good night's rest,
Spartacus.

27:36.117 --> 27:37.380
In there.

28:21.888 --> 28:23.014
Woman!

28:24.323 --> 28:27.122
I've warned you
about this kind of thing.

28:31.529 --> 28:33.520
All right,
bring them in.

28:53.447 --> 28:56.314
No talking!
Move along.

30:00.268 --> 30:01.929
Did they hurt you?

30:07.808 --> 30:08.832
No.

30:52.745 --> 30:53.939
That's a kill.

30:54.012 --> 30:56.276
One, two,

30:56.348 --> 30:59.748
three, four, five.

30:59.817 --> 31:02.047
One, two,

31:02.119 --> 31:04.110
three, four...

31:59.867 --> 32:02.392
We have visitors,
tremendous visitors.

32:02.468 --> 32:05.597
Two simply enormous
Roman lords on the hill.

32:05.670 --> 32:07.639
How easily impressed
you are, Ramon.

32:07.706 --> 32:09.936
Just 'cause they're Romans,
I suppose they're enormous.

32:10.008 --> 32:11.998
Tell them to wait
for me when they arrive.

32:12.076 --> 32:13.441
Master,
you don't understand...

32:13.511 --> 32:15.877
How enormous
do these Roman lords get?

32:15.946 --> 32:18.813
One of them
is Marcus Licinius Crassus.

32:18.882 --> 32:20.543
What?
Wait a minute.

32:20.617 --> 32:24.143
Crassus here? My red
toga with the acorns.

32:24.219 --> 32:26.654
Chairs in the atrium.
Second-best wine.

32:26.722 --> 32:30.020
No, the best,
but small goblets.

32:30.091 --> 32:32.958
Gracchus. You know
how Crassus loathes him.

32:33.827 --> 32:35.386
Take him away.

32:35.462 --> 32:37.089
I can't lift it.

32:37.164 --> 32:39.723
Use your imagination.
Cover him.

32:39.799 --> 32:42.324
Tell Marcellus
to get the men ready.

32:42.401 --> 32:44.869
Crassus has expensive taste.
He'll want a show.

32:44.936 --> 32:46.461
Forgive me, Gracchus.

33:11.692 --> 33:14.217
Marcus
Licinius Crassus.

33:14.294 --> 33:16.057
Most noble
radiance,

33:16.129 --> 33:18.620
first general
of the Republic,

33:18.697 --> 33:22.531
father and defender
of Rome, honor my house.

33:22.601 --> 33:24.625
Bless it
with your presence.

33:33.410 --> 33:35.104
Wine, sweetmeats!

33:35.177 --> 33:38.374
Can't you see that
Their Honors are exhausted?

33:41.850 --> 33:43.841
Have the goodness
to sit.

33:49.223 --> 33:51.622
Is anything wrong,
Your Nobility?

33:52.492 --> 33:53.516
No.

33:54.827 --> 33:58.126
Welcome to the
Lady Claudia Maria,

33:58.196 --> 34:01.496
former wife of
Lucius Caius Marius

34:01.566 --> 34:05.024
whose recent execution
touched us all deeply.

34:05.870 --> 34:07.201
Honor
to the Lady Helena,

34:07.271 --> 34:10.501
daughter of the late
Septimus Optimus Glabrus,

34:10.572 --> 34:14.065
whose fame shall live on
forever in the person of his son,

34:14.141 --> 34:15.667
your brother,

34:15.744 --> 34:19.010
Marcus
Publius Glabrus,

34:19.413 --> 34:21.473
hero
of the Eastern War.

34:21.549 --> 34:23.277
How very much
he knows.

34:23.985 --> 34:26.714
Allow me to bring
you up-to-date.

34:26.786 --> 34:30.223
We're here to celebrate the marriage
of my brother to the Lady Claudia.

34:30.289 --> 34:33.054
A mating of eagles,
Your Sanctity.

34:33.125 --> 34:34.786
Fan His Magnitude.
He sweats.

34:34.860 --> 34:36.088
No, no.
No, no.

34:36.161 --> 34:38.822
My young friends desire a
private showing of two pairs.

34:38.897 --> 34:40.626
Two pairs?

34:40.697 --> 34:44.190
Oh, yes. I have something
that would please them.

34:44.268 --> 34:45.929
Two pairs
to the death.

34:46.003 --> 34:48.527
To the death,
Your Ladyship?

34:48.603 --> 34:51.096
Surely you don't think
we came all the way to Capua

34:51.174 --> 34:54.040
for gymnastics?

34:54.109 --> 34:56.235
But I beg,
Your Honors,

34:56.311 --> 34:59.974
we train the finest
gladiators in all Italy.

35:00.047 --> 35:01.913
We can give you
a display of swordsmanship

35:01.982 --> 35:04.814
which is better than
you can see in Rome.

35:04.884 --> 35:06.614
When they're sold,
their new masters

35:06.686 --> 35:08.051
may do with them
as they wish.

35:08.121 --> 35:11.988
But here, no, we never
fight them to the death.

35:12.057 --> 35:13.525
Crassus.

35:13.592 --> 35:16.356
Today is
an exception.

35:16.427 --> 35:18.020
But the ill feeling,

35:18.095 --> 35:20.291
it would spread
through the whole school.

35:20.363 --> 35:23.560
Then the cost.
Oh, the cost.

35:23.633 --> 35:25.260
Name your price.

35:27.336 --> 35:30.101
25,000 sesterces.

35:31.073 --> 35:32.437
Arrange it.

35:33.808 --> 35:35.606
Are you serious,
sir?

35:37.778 --> 35:39.678
Arrange it
immediately.

35:40.414 --> 35:43.143
Of course, we shall want
to choose them ourselves.

35:43.215 --> 35:46.583
You do have
a certain variety?

35:46.652 --> 35:47.949
Inexhaustible.

35:55.793 --> 35:59.092
Spartacus, there's going to be
a fight to the death.

35:59.429 --> 36:01.022
To the death?
How do you know?

36:01.097 --> 36:03.464
I heard Marcellus
tell one of his guards.

36:03.533 --> 36:05.557
Who fights?
I don't know.

36:08.537 --> 36:10.005
To the death.

36:13.207 --> 36:15.540
What if they matched
you and me?

36:16.943 --> 36:18.604
They won't.

36:18.678 --> 36:20.305
What if they did?

36:21.047 --> 36:22.639
Would you fight?

36:25.217 --> 36:27.276
I'd have to.
So would you.

36:28.353 --> 36:30.344
Would you try
to kill me?

36:32.256 --> 36:33.746
Yes, I'd kill.

36:34.658 --> 36:36.558
I'd try to stay...

36:36.627 --> 36:39.618
I'd try to stay alive,
and so would you.

36:39.695 --> 36:42.756
All gladiators
up to the training area.

36:42.832 --> 36:45.231
Some visitors
want to admire you.

36:49.703 --> 36:52.172
Form a line in front of me.

36:52.239 --> 36:53.900
Would Your Excellencies

36:53.974 --> 36:56.237
care to make
your selection now?

36:58.244 --> 36:59.473
Claudia.

37:09.120 --> 37:11.179
Oh, they're
magnificent.

37:11.255 --> 37:13.518
For you,
Lady Helena,

37:13.590 --> 37:16.116
may I suggest
Praxus?

37:18.127 --> 37:19.788
A veritable tiger.

37:20.863 --> 37:22.524
I don't like him.

37:28.969 --> 37:30.402
I prefer that one.

37:30.470 --> 37:32.370
Which one?
No, no.

37:32.439 --> 37:34.566
David?

37:34.640 --> 37:37.132
Oh, Crixus, yes.

37:37.743 --> 37:40.575
Ah, Marcellus,
Crixus for the short sword.

37:45.182 --> 37:48.641
Have you ever seen such a
pair of shoulders? Dionysius.

37:49.486 --> 37:50.953
I admit he's small,

37:51.020 --> 37:53.182
but he's very compact
and extremely strong.

37:53.256 --> 37:55.122
In fact, he looks...

37:55.191 --> 37:58.888
He looks smaller here
than he does in the arena.

38:00.962 --> 38:02.190
Optical.

38:03.831 --> 38:05.458
Give me that one.

38:06.100 --> 38:09.330
Oh, Galino.
Yes, yes. Galino.

38:09.402 --> 38:11.268
You have a shrewd eye,
Your Pulchritude,

38:11.337 --> 38:13.464
if I may permit
myself the...

38:13.539 --> 38:15.063
Galino.

38:15.140 --> 38:17.404
Practically every man
in this school

38:17.476 --> 38:19.000
is an expert
with a Thracian sword

38:19.077 --> 38:23.070
but the trident is something
very rare these days.

38:23.147 --> 38:27.276
May I suggest
the Ethiopian?

38:29.819 --> 38:32.788
There are very few
Ethiopians in the country.

38:33.155 --> 38:36.886
Ethiopians are recognized
as masters of the trident.

38:43.630 --> 38:45.121
I'll take him.

38:46.265 --> 38:49.064
Draba? Oh, no.
For you I want the best.

38:49.135 --> 38:52.126
I do think the Ethiopian...
I want the most beautiful.

38:52.204 --> 38:54.365
I'll take
the big black one.

38:56.408 --> 38:57.567
Draba.

38:59.009 --> 39:02.446
Only one man in the entire
school stands a chance

39:02.513 --> 39:06.005
with the Thracian knife
against the trident.

39:06.082 --> 39:07.607
There.

39:08.717 --> 39:09.980
Over there,
Lady Helena.

39:10.052 --> 39:11.611
He's impertinent.

39:12.788 --> 39:14.016
I'll take him.

39:14.088 --> 39:18.218
And he's a coward to boot.
Have him flogged.

39:19.327 --> 39:22.295
Over there, Lady Helena.
The beast of Libya.

39:23.530 --> 39:25.293
I prefer
the coward.

39:28.834 --> 39:30.393
Spartacus.

39:30.469 --> 39:34.496
If both men are down and refuse to fight
your trainer will slit their throats.

39:34.572 --> 39:35.972
We want no tricks.

39:36.040 --> 39:38.372
Tricks, madam?
At the school of Batiatus?

39:38.442 --> 39:41.900
You heard the instruction,
Marcellus? Remember it.

39:42.745 --> 39:45.772
I feel sorry for the
poor things in this heat.

39:45.848 --> 39:48.407
Don't put them in those
suffocating tunics.

39:48.483 --> 39:51.111
Let them wear just
enough for modesty.

39:51.186 --> 39:54.382
Whatever they wear, Lady,
they'll bless your name.

39:55.623 --> 39:57.489
Back, the rest of you.

39:58.025 --> 39:59.685
Our choosing
has bored you?

39:59.759 --> 40:03.161
No, most exciting.
I tingle.

40:03.596 --> 40:05.256
Do let's get out
of the sun.

40:05.330 --> 40:09.028
May I conduct Your
Magnificences to the gallery?

40:21.143 --> 40:23.669
An eavesdropper.
Oh, the gods.

40:25.581 --> 40:28.811
How far from Rome must I go
to avoid that cunning face?

40:28.883 --> 40:32.478
Don't talk about
Gracchus. He's so hateful.

40:32.553 --> 40:35.317
For Gracchus, hatred of the
patrician class is a profession

40:35.389 --> 40:37.118
and not such
a bad one, either.

40:37.191 --> 40:38.680
How else
can one become

40:38.758 --> 40:41.853
master of the mob
and first senator of Rome?

40:41.928 --> 40:44.225
Crassus,
it's so boring.

40:49.700 --> 40:51.964
I believe that girl
smells of perfume.

40:52.036 --> 40:55.937
Whatever it is,
she smells most delectable.

40:56.005 --> 40:59.441
You can't keep slaves from
stealing unless you chain them.

40:59.509 --> 41:02.603
When a slave's as pretty as she
is, she doesn't have to steal.

41:02.678 --> 41:05.476
An arrangement is made.

41:05.546 --> 41:07.947
If her ankles
are good,

41:08.015 --> 41:10.882
you can be sure
an arrangement was made.

41:12.986 --> 41:14.647
Oh, master!

41:14.721 --> 41:16.189
A catastrophe.

41:16.255 --> 41:17.916
I've been anointed.

41:17.990 --> 41:20.425
Why, you trollop!
You did that on purpose.

41:20.493 --> 41:22.687
It was an accident.
Come here, girl.

41:27.831 --> 41:29.595
Don't be frightened.

41:30.334 --> 41:32.063
What country
are you from?

41:32.135 --> 41:33.363
Britannia.

41:34.871 --> 41:37.169
How long
have you been a slave?

41:39.407 --> 41:40.932
Since I was 13.

41:42.878 --> 41:45.243
You have
a certain education.

41:45.312 --> 41:48.407
My first master had me
tutored for his children.

41:54.621 --> 41:57.350
I like her.
She has spirit.

41:58.557 --> 41:59.888
I'll buy her.

41:59.958 --> 42:01.448
Buy her,
Your Magnificence?

42:01.526 --> 42:03.926
I have spent quite
a lot of money on her.

42:03.995 --> 42:06.259
I've no doubt of it.
2,000 sesterces.

42:06.329 --> 42:08.764
She'll be waiting
at your litter.

42:08.832 --> 42:11.824
No, I don't want her
feet spoiled by walking.

42:12.534 --> 42:15.868
Send her to Rome with your steward
the next time he has to go there.

42:15.938 --> 42:18.531
He leaves tomorrow,
and the girl with him.

42:18.606 --> 42:21.132
More wine,
and thank your gods.

42:22.377 --> 42:25.140
You provoke me, Crassus. I
shan't be nice to you anymore.

42:25.212 --> 42:26.736
Why distress me
so much?

42:26.813 --> 42:30.180
You're horribly rich, yet you're
the only one of my brother's friends

42:30.249 --> 42:32.980
who hasn't given him
a wedding present.

42:37.289 --> 42:40.189
I was saving it
for a more suitable moment.

42:40.991 --> 42:43.551
Here.
Give it to him, child.

42:44.495 --> 42:45.586
What is it?

42:45.662 --> 42:49.997
As from this moment, your husband
is commander of the garrison of Rome.

42:50.832 --> 42:52.164
Wonderful.

42:55.237 --> 42:58.865
I don't know how I shall
ever be able to repay you.

42:58.940 --> 43:01.135
Time will solve
that mystery.

43:02.943 --> 43:04.740
The garrison of Rome.

43:04.811 --> 43:06.006
Yes.

43:06.079 --> 43:09.742
The only power in Rome strong enough
to checkmate Gracchus and his Senate.

43:09.815 --> 43:11.374
You are clever.

43:23.493 --> 43:24.789
Open up.

43:46.411 --> 43:48.072
Through that door.

44:03.026 --> 44:05.016
You will have to
watch him, Claudia.

44:05.094 --> 44:08.029
Father almost disinherited him
because of slave girls.

44:08.097 --> 44:11.759
The marriage contract
absolutely forbids a harem.

44:11.833 --> 44:14.426
What about
your litter bearers?

44:14.501 --> 44:19.132
Every one of them is under 20
and taller than they should be.

44:19.206 --> 44:22.334
She sets rather
a high standard for you.

44:22.408 --> 44:24.900
Your pleasure, Your Highness.

44:25.211 --> 44:26.734
To you, my dear,

44:26.811 --> 44:30.247
shall go the honor of
starting this poetic drama.

44:33.951 --> 44:35.145
Open up.

44:41.691 --> 44:44.250
First pair!
Crixus and Galino!

45:02.374 --> 45:05.468
Those who are about
to die salute you.

46:43.491 --> 46:44.787
Crixus.

46:55.067 --> 46:56.363
Next pair!

47:18.919 --> 47:21.547
Those who are about
to die salute you.

48:16.333 --> 48:18.301
Your Thracian's
doing well.

48:18.368 --> 48:21.860
How were you able to get my
appointment without Gracchus knowing?

48:21.938 --> 48:23.804
I fought fire
with oil.

48:23.873 --> 48:25.772
I purchased the Senate
behind his back.

48:25.841 --> 48:28.309
I still think the
trident's going to win.

49:55.648 --> 49:57.013
Why doesn't he kill him?

49:57.082 --> 49:58.414
Kill him.

49:59.917 --> 50:01.783
What's the matter now?

50:02.887 --> 50:04.150
Kill him!
Kill him!

50:04.222 --> 50:05.586
Kill him,
you imbecile!

50:05.656 --> 50:07.146
Kill him!
Kill him!

51:54.979 --> 51:57.208
He'll hang there
till he rots.

53:31.558 --> 53:33.685
Take a last look,
Spartacus.

53:33.993 --> 53:36.587
She's going to Rome.
She's been sold.

53:39.298 --> 53:40.891
She's been sold?

53:43.568 --> 53:45.968
No talking
in the kitchen, slave.

54:39.847 --> 54:41.076
There's trouble
in the mess hall.

54:41.149 --> 54:43.480
They killed Marcellus
and maybe the other two.

54:43.550 --> 54:44.608
Call out the guard.

54:45.952 --> 54:46.976
Move, move.

54:49.255 --> 54:52.657
On second thoughts, I'll
deliver the girl personally.

54:52.825 --> 54:55.987
Ride to Capua. Call out the
garrison. I don't trust this lot.

54:56.060 --> 54:57.357
I hold you
responsible.

54:57.428 --> 54:58.487
Yes, sir.

57:53.739 --> 57:57.039
Around Capua,
they ravaged the countryside,

57:57.109 --> 57:59.543
forcing other slaves
to join them.

57:59.611 --> 58:03.308
Looting, robbing,
burning everything,

58:03.380 --> 58:05.178
while they make
their camp

58:05.249 --> 58:08.048
in the escarpments
of Vesuvius.

58:09.018 --> 58:11.612
Each day
swells their numbers.

58:12.555 --> 58:15.888
The situation lies
in the hands

58:15.957 --> 58:17.789
of this august body.

58:20.928 --> 58:23.295
Where's
the mighty Crassus?

58:24.331 --> 58:26.322
Out of the city.
At least, you're here.

58:26.399 --> 58:29.631
No need to fear for Rome
as long as Glabrus is with us.

58:29.703 --> 58:34.503
Let me add, over 100
estates have been burned.

58:35.107 --> 58:37.370
Among them,
gentlemen, my own.

58:37.842 --> 58:42.278
Burned to the ground
and 3 million sesterces lost.

58:42.946 --> 58:46.780
I propose the immediate recall of
Pompey and his legions from Spain.

58:46.850 --> 58:49.147
I could raise 500 men
and bring the lot of them in.

58:49.218 --> 58:51.152
Don't make a fool
of yourself.

58:51.220 --> 58:55.178
Why call back the legions

58:55.256 --> 58:57.919
when the garrison of Rome
has nothing to do

58:57.992 --> 59:00.517
but to defend us
from sausage makers?

59:02.363 --> 59:04.626
Let's send Glabrus
against these scoundrels.

59:04.697 --> 59:07.030
Give them a taste
of Roman steel.

59:09.835 --> 59:13.237
I protest.
I most strongly protest.

59:13.305 --> 59:15.636
There are more slaves
in Rome than Romans.

59:15.706 --> 59:17.072
With the garrison absent,

59:17.141 --> 59:19.803
what's to prevent them
from rising, too?

59:19.977 --> 59:23.242
I did not say
the whole garrison.

59:23.313 --> 59:25.941
Six cohorts
will more than do the job.

59:26.082 --> 59:27.447
The rest can stay in Rome

59:27.516 --> 59:29.780
to save you
from your housemaids.

59:31.919 --> 59:34.616
Will you accept
such a charge, Glabrus?

59:39.626 --> 59:44.324
I accept the charge of the Senate,
if the Senate truly charges me.

59:45.498 --> 59:49.092
The garrison of Rome
stands ready.

59:53.471 --> 59:56.303
Slave hunting's
a dirty business.

59:56.373 --> 59:58.398
It takes a brave commander
to consent to it.

59:58.475 --> 01:00:00.841
I propose we turn
the city out tomorrow

01:00:00.910 --> 01:00:03.208
in tribute to Glabrus
as he marches through.

01:00:06.481 --> 01:00:11.577
And for temporary command of
the garrison during his absence,

01:00:11.652 --> 01:00:15.020
I propose
Caius Julius Caesar.

01:00:30.568 --> 01:00:34.868
You don't look very happy
over the new job.

01:00:35.438 --> 01:00:37.907
It's not a serious disturbance.
Glabrus will be back.

01:00:37.974 --> 01:00:39.168
Maybe.

01:00:39.942 --> 01:00:41.307
At least
it gives me a chance

01:00:41.377 --> 01:00:44.675
to separate Glabrus
from Crassus for a while.

01:00:44.779 --> 01:00:46.474
You know,

01:00:46.548 --> 01:00:49.744
this Republic of ours is
something like a rich widow.

01:00:49.817 --> 01:00:52.047
Most Romans
love her as their mother.

01:00:52.119 --> 01:00:56.419
But Crassus dreams of marrying
the old girl, to put it politely.

01:00:56.656 --> 01:00:59.284
Hail Glabrus.
Hail Glabrus.

01:00:59.358 --> 01:01:00.984
Hail Glabrus!

01:01:05.430 --> 01:01:07.397
God be with you,
Glabrus.

01:01:07.464 --> 01:01:09.023
And with you,
too.

01:01:14.737 --> 01:01:17.763
I hope he returns
to such applause.

01:01:18.640 --> 01:01:20.768
Oh, one fat one,
Fimbria.

01:01:26.747 --> 01:01:29.443
Keep the change.
Give it to your wife.

01:01:29.516 --> 01:01:30.915
May the gods
adore you.

01:01:30.984 --> 01:01:33.453
Only through
your prayers.

01:01:33.520 --> 01:01:37.888
Let's make an old-fashioned
sacrifice for Glabrus' success, hmm?

01:01:37.957 --> 01:01:40.220
I thought you had reservations
about the gods.

01:01:40.291 --> 01:01:42.692
Privately, I believe
in none. Neither do you.

01:01:42.760 --> 01:01:44.422
Publicly,
I believe in them all.

01:01:44.496 --> 01:01:46.986
Greetings,
Marcus Clodius Flavius!

01:02:16.588 --> 01:02:18.318
Is Marcus Glabrus
in attendance?

01:02:18.390 --> 01:02:19.550
He awaits you
in the atrium, sir.

01:02:19.624 --> 01:02:21.387
Excellent.

01:02:23.794 --> 01:02:24.783
What have we here?

01:02:24.861 --> 01:02:27.023
A gift from
the Governor of Sicily.

01:02:42.509 --> 01:02:46.275
"Antoninus.
Sicilian, age 26,

01:02:47.580 --> 01:02:49.173
"singer of songs. "

01:02:50.016 --> 01:02:53.075
For whom did you practice
this wondrous talent?

01:02:53.385 --> 01:02:57.616
For the children of my master
whom I also taught the classics.

01:02:57.688 --> 01:02:59.656
Classics, indeed.

01:02:59.723 --> 01:03:03.682
What position have we, I wonder,
for a boy of such varied gifts?

01:03:06.229 --> 01:03:08.493
You shall be my body servant.
Instruct him.

01:03:08.565 --> 01:03:10.555
All of you,
come with me.

01:03:25.378 --> 01:03:27.243
Are you on guard duty?

01:03:30.316 --> 01:03:33.045
My dear Crassus,
congratulate me.

01:03:33.117 --> 01:03:36.212
Or better still, let us
congratulate each other.

01:03:37.354 --> 01:03:39.015
I congratulate us.

01:03:39.222 --> 01:03:43.750
Tomorrow I lead six cohorts of the
garrison against the slaves on Vesuvius.

01:03:43.826 --> 01:03:46.318
The whole city is
turning out to see us off.

01:03:46.395 --> 01:03:48.693
Great merciful
bloodstained gods!

01:03:50.065 --> 01:03:51.464
Your pardon.

01:03:51.666 --> 01:03:54.658
I always address heaven
in moments of triumph.

01:03:55.869 --> 01:03:58.634
Did Gracchus have something to
do with this brilliant affair?

01:03:58.706 --> 01:04:02.072
Yes, he proposed it.
Rather decently, too.

01:04:02.141 --> 01:04:03.370
And you?

01:04:03.443 --> 01:04:08.141
Do you think I made you commander to
control some rock patch on Vesuvius?

01:04:08.814 --> 01:04:10.838
It was to control
the streets of Rome!

01:04:10.915 --> 01:04:14.749
I only take six cohorts. The
rest of the garrison remain.

01:04:14.819 --> 01:04:15.876
Under whose command?

01:04:15.952 --> 01:04:17.215
Under Caesar's.

01:04:17.287 --> 01:04:19.949
Oh, excellent,
excellent.

01:04:20.023 --> 01:04:22.753
Finding Gracchus in control
of the mob and the Senate,

01:04:22.825 --> 01:04:26.386
you felt impelled to hand over
the garrison to him also.

01:04:27.795 --> 01:04:29.161
I see.

01:04:29.697 --> 01:04:33.223
I'll refuse, withdraw
from the expedition.

01:04:33.300 --> 01:04:35.268
One of the disadvantages
of being a patrician

01:04:35.335 --> 01:04:38.236
is that occasionally you're
obliged to act like one.

01:04:38.304 --> 01:04:40.500
You've pledged to go,
and go you must.

01:04:40.573 --> 01:04:42.700
If Gracchus should decide
to move against you...

01:04:42.775 --> 01:04:45.004
He won't!
Has no need to.

01:04:45.076 --> 01:04:48.603
He has, with your assistance,
immobilized me altogether.

01:04:50.080 --> 01:04:53.175
Your legions are in camp
outside the city walls?

01:04:54.051 --> 01:04:55.415
My legions?

01:04:56.085 --> 01:04:58.816
Do you truly believe I'd
order my legions to enter Rome?

01:04:58.888 --> 01:05:01.584
You can, if you have to.

01:05:01.657 --> 01:05:03.955
Are you not aware
of Rome's most ancient law,

01:05:04.026 --> 01:05:07.392
that no general may enter the city
at the head of his armed legions?

01:05:07.461 --> 01:05:09.259
Sulla did.
Sulla?

01:05:09.397 --> 01:05:11.193
To the infamy
of his name!

01:05:11.264 --> 01:05:13.790
To the utter damnation
of his line!

01:05:15.602 --> 01:05:17.364
No, my young friend.

01:05:18.170 --> 01:05:22.164
One day I shall cleanse this Rome
which my fathers bequeathed me.

01:05:22.340 --> 01:05:25.799
I shall restore all the
traditions that made her great.

01:05:27.111 --> 01:05:29.909
It follows that I cannot
come to power or defend myself

01:05:29.980 --> 01:05:33.540
by an act which betrays the
most sacred tradition of all.

01:05:34.050 --> 01:05:37.543
I shall not bring my legions
within these walls.

01:05:38.554 --> 01:05:41.079
I shall not violate Rome

01:05:41.723 --> 01:05:44.055
at the moment
of possessing her.

01:05:48.128 --> 01:05:49.152
Go.

01:05:50.296 --> 01:05:52.094
Prepare your troops
at once.

01:05:52.165 --> 01:05:55.964
March out of Rome tonight,
but the tribute is impossible.

01:05:56.635 --> 01:06:00.697
We've already been made to look a fool.
Let's not add the trappings of a clown.

01:06:00.772 --> 01:06:04.901
Leave by unfrequented streets
without fanfare, without even a drum.

01:06:06.343 --> 01:06:07.674
Sneak out.

01:06:09.813 --> 01:06:11.212
As you wish.

01:06:12.048 --> 01:06:14.380
And for heaven's sake,
my young friend,

01:06:14.450 --> 01:06:17.647
see to it that you don't
have to sneak back again.

01:06:18.786 --> 01:06:20.049
Farewell.

01:08:45.407 --> 01:08:47.398
Come on,
fat boy!

01:09:29.943 --> 01:09:30.933
Spartacus, come on!

01:09:31.011 --> 01:09:32.171
Come on!

01:09:32.246 --> 01:09:33.734
Noble Romans.

01:09:34.247 --> 01:09:36.305
Fighting each other
like animals.

01:09:37.582 --> 01:09:40.779
Your new masters, betting
to see who'll die first.

01:09:43.488 --> 01:09:45.113
Drop your swords.

01:09:45.421 --> 01:09:48.255
No! No!
No! No!

01:09:52.395 --> 01:09:56.160
I want to see their blood
here where Draba died!

01:09:58.066 --> 01:10:01.365
When I fight matched pairs,
they fight to the death.

01:10:02.770 --> 01:10:05.102
I made myself a promise,
Crixus.

01:10:05.339 --> 01:10:07.500
I swore that if I ever
got out of this place,

01:10:07.574 --> 01:10:10.805
I'd die before I'd watch two
men fight to the death again.

01:10:14.580 --> 01:10:16.776
Draba made that promise,
too.

01:10:18.249 --> 01:10:19.615
He kept it.

01:10:21.319 --> 01:10:22.649
So will I.

01:10:26.023 --> 01:10:28.115
Go on. Get out!

01:10:31.794 --> 01:10:33.727
What are we,
Crixus?

01:10:33.795 --> 01:10:36.389
What are we becoming?
Romans?

01:10:36.464 --> 01:10:39.456
Have we learned nothing?
What's happening to us?

01:10:39.533 --> 01:10:41.968
We look for wine when
we should be hunting bread.

01:10:42.036 --> 01:10:44.799
When you've got wine,
you don't need bread!

01:10:46.306 --> 01:10:49.366
We can't just be a gang
of drunken raiders.

01:10:49.442 --> 01:10:50.772
What else
can we be?

01:10:50.842 --> 01:10:51.866
Gladiators.

01:10:53.045 --> 01:10:54.911
An army of gladiators.

01:10:55.580 --> 01:10:57.741
There's never been
an army like that.

01:10:57.815 --> 01:11:00.648
One gladiator's worth
any two Roman soldiers.

01:11:00.718 --> 01:11:03.550
We beat the Roman guards here,
but a Roman army's different.

01:11:03.620 --> 01:11:05.782
They fight different.

01:11:05.855 --> 01:11:08.881
We can beat anything they
send against us if we want to.

01:11:08.958 --> 01:11:10.892
It takes a big army.

01:11:10.960 --> 01:11:12.427
We'll have
a big army.

01:11:12.494 --> 01:11:16.589
Once we're on the march, we'll free
every slave in every town and village.

01:11:16.664 --> 01:11:18.632
Can anybody
get a bigger army?

01:11:18.699 --> 01:11:20.929
Once we cross the Alps,
we're safe.

01:11:21.001 --> 01:11:24.231
Nobody can cross the Alps. Every
pass is defended by its own legion.

01:11:24.303 --> 01:11:27.432
There's only one way
to get out of this country.

01:11:28.240 --> 01:11:29.537
The sea.

01:11:29.607 --> 01:11:32.338
What good is the sea
if you have no ships?

01:11:32.410 --> 01:11:34.743
The Cilician pirates
have ships.

01:11:34.978 --> 01:11:36.970
They're at war
with Rome.

01:11:37.481 --> 01:11:40.939
Every Roman galley that sails
out of Brundusium pays tribute.

01:11:41.017 --> 01:11:44.248
They've got the biggest fleet in the
world. I was a galley slave with them.

01:11:44.320 --> 01:11:46.185
Give them enough gold,
they'll take you anywhere.

01:11:46.254 --> 01:11:47.483
We haven't got
enough gold.

01:11:47.556 --> 01:11:50.252
Take every Roman we capture
and warm his back a little.

01:11:50.325 --> 01:11:51.951
We'll have gold all right.

01:11:53.227 --> 01:11:54.991
Spartacus is right!

01:11:55.363 --> 01:11:58.388
Let's hire these pirates and
march straight to Brundusium!

01:12:45.237 --> 01:12:48.296
Come join us.
All of you, come join us.

01:13:06.220 --> 01:13:07.813
Come on
and join us!

01:13:21.266 --> 01:13:22.460
Come on!

01:13:22.534 --> 01:13:23.728
Hey!

01:13:33.176 --> 01:13:35.201
Back to Vesuvius!

01:13:56.795 --> 01:13:58.058
Varinia.

01:14:03.367 --> 01:14:05.926
I thought
I'd never see you again.

01:14:20.315 --> 01:14:22.339
Everything's so different.

01:14:28.588 --> 01:14:30.886
The last time I saw you,
you...

01:14:31.924 --> 01:14:35.792
You were waiting
in the arena to...

01:14:41.966 --> 01:14:45.332
I... I thought
you were in Rome.

01:14:50.539 --> 01:14:52.166
How'd you escape?

01:14:52.741 --> 01:14:53.799
I...

01:14:54.743 --> 01:14:58.838
I jumped out of the cart
and Batiatus was so fat...

01:15:09.855 --> 01:15:12.255
I flew out of the cart

01:15:13.825 --> 01:15:16.191
and Batiatus
was so fat

01:15:16.794 --> 01:15:19.353
that he couldn't
catch me.

01:15:19.429 --> 01:15:21.625
He couldn't
catch up with me.

01:15:22.366 --> 01:15:24.333
Do you realize

01:15:24.400 --> 01:15:27.665
nobody can ever
sell you again?

01:15:27.737 --> 01:15:29.636
Nobody can sell you.

01:15:29.704 --> 01:15:32.272
Or give you away.

01:15:32.340 --> 01:15:34.604
Nobody can ever
make you stay with anyone.

01:15:34.675 --> 01:15:37.167
Nobody can make you
stay with anybody.

01:15:39.413 --> 01:15:42.143
Oh, I love you,
Spartacus.

01:15:46.118 --> 01:15:49.554
I love you.
I love you. I love you.

01:15:51.989 --> 01:15:53.980
I still can't believe it.

01:15:56.760 --> 01:16:00.662
Forbid me
ever to leave you.

01:16:06.702 --> 01:16:08.294
I do forbid you.

01:16:10.805 --> 01:16:12.273
I forbid you.

01:16:14.107 --> 01:16:15.575
I forbid you.

01:16:16.643 --> 01:16:18.633
I forbid you.

01:16:42.664 --> 01:16:45.258
It was funny
at the time.

01:16:45.801 --> 01:16:48.326
How good you are to me,
if I may say so.

01:16:48.402 --> 01:16:50.166
You may.
Thank you.

01:16:50.972 --> 01:16:52.905
Don't just eye those birds. Eat them.

01:16:52.973 --> 01:16:55.737
There's no need to be on
your best behavior here.

01:16:55.809 --> 01:17:00.803
May I remind you you've
been good to me in the past.

01:17:00.879 --> 01:17:02.347
I've been good to you?
Oh, ho, ho.

01:17:02.414 --> 01:17:03.574
Oh, yes.

01:17:03.648 --> 01:17:08.108
You've sold me slaves at an
extremely reasonable price.

01:17:09.052 --> 01:17:12.955
And you arranged gladiatorial
jousts at cost, practically.

01:17:13.390 --> 01:17:16.120
You are both
ethical in business

01:17:16.192 --> 01:17:19.389
and certainly
farsighted socially.

01:17:19.595 --> 01:17:21.995
Zenobia's put on weight
since I last saw her.

01:17:22.063 --> 01:17:23.326
Hasn't she?
I like it.

01:17:23.398 --> 01:17:24.524
So do I.

01:17:26.267 --> 01:17:28.792
You and I have a tendency
towards corpulence.

01:17:28.869 --> 01:17:32.498
Corpulence makes a man reasonable,
pleasant and phlegmatic.

01:17:32.572 --> 01:17:36.473
Have you noticed the nastiest
of tyrants are invariably thin?

01:17:38.710 --> 01:17:42.942
In spite of your vices, you are
the most generous Roman of our time.

01:17:43.014 --> 01:17:44.311
Vices?

01:17:46.784 --> 01:17:47.978
Ladies.

01:17:51.154 --> 01:17:53.747
Ladies?
Since when are they a vice?

01:17:54.256 --> 01:17:57.783
Perhaps I used the wrong word.
An eccentricity, a foible.

01:17:57.860 --> 01:18:00.259
I hope I pronounced
that word...

01:18:00.328 --> 01:18:03.161
It's well-known that even your
groom and butler are women.

01:18:03.231 --> 01:18:05.665
I'm the most virtuous man
in Rome.

01:18:05.966 --> 01:18:09.493
I keep these women out of my
respect for Roman morality.

01:18:09.669 --> 01:18:11.967
That morality which
has made Rome strong enough

01:18:12.038 --> 01:18:14.768
to steal two-thirds of the
world from its rightful owners,

01:18:14.840 --> 01:18:18.435
founded on the sanctity
of Roman marriage and family.

01:18:18.510 --> 01:18:21.911
I happen to like women.
I have a promiscuous nature

01:18:21.979 --> 01:18:25.039
and unlike these aristocrats,
I will not take a marriage vow

01:18:25.115 --> 01:18:27.708
which my nature
will prevent me from keeping.

01:18:27.784 --> 01:18:31.049
You have too great a respect
for the purity of womankind.

01:18:31.120 --> 01:18:32.348
Exactly.

01:18:33.522 --> 01:18:37.151
It must be tantalizing to be
surrounded by so much purity.

01:18:41.195 --> 01:18:42.458
It is.

01:18:42.997 --> 01:18:46.523
Let's mix business with
pleasure. How may I help you?

01:18:49.068 --> 01:18:52.526
Great Gracchus,
I find it difficult to hate,

01:18:52.604 --> 01:18:54.936
but there's one man I can't
think of without fuming.

01:18:55.006 --> 01:18:56.474
Who's that?
Crassus.

01:18:56.541 --> 01:18:59.271
You've grown
very ambitious in your hatred.

01:18:59.344 --> 01:19:02.779
Do you blame me? There I was, better
than a millionaire in the morning

01:19:02.846 --> 01:19:07.214
and a penniless refugee by nightfall
with nothing but rags and my flesh.

01:19:07.283 --> 01:19:10.616
All because Crassus decides
to break his journey at Capua

01:19:10.686 --> 01:19:13.848
with a couple of capricious,
over-painted nymphs.

01:19:14.355 --> 01:19:16.880
These two daughters of Venus

01:19:16.957 --> 01:19:19.688
had to taunt the gladiators,
force them to fight to the death,

01:19:19.760 --> 01:19:22.785
and before I knew what had
happened, revolution on my hands.

01:19:22.862 --> 01:19:26.696
What revenge have you in mind?

01:19:28.500 --> 01:19:30.798
I sold Crassus
this woman Varinia.

01:19:30.869 --> 01:19:31.961
Whom?

01:19:32.404 --> 01:19:35.099
Varinia. May the gods
give her wings.

01:19:35.172 --> 01:19:36.572
There was no contract,

01:19:36.640 --> 01:19:40.098
but she was clearly his slave
as soon as the deal was made.

01:19:40.176 --> 01:19:42.736
Now she's off with Spartacus
killing people in their beds.

01:19:42.812 --> 01:19:45.974
And Crassus,
no mention of money.

01:19:47.049 --> 01:19:49.847
You never offered me
this woman. Why not?

01:19:50.518 --> 01:19:53.146
Well, she's not
remotely your type, Gracchus.

01:19:53.221 --> 01:19:54.779
She is very thin and...

01:19:54.856 --> 01:19:56.152
Look around you.

01:19:56.623 --> 01:19:59.456
You'll see women
of all sizes.

01:19:59.526 --> 01:20:01.015
Well, yes.

01:20:01.093 --> 01:20:03.960
500 sesterces deposit
on Varinia.

01:20:04.029 --> 01:20:08.227
Since he hasn't paid, this gives me
first call over Crassus when she's caught.

01:20:08.800 --> 01:20:10.700
May the gods adore you.

01:20:11.636 --> 01:20:13.865
Why do you buy a woman
you've never seen?

01:20:13.937 --> 01:20:16.770
To annoy Crassus, of course,
and help you.

01:20:23.812 --> 01:20:25.837
Fetch a stool,
Antoninus.

01:20:32.186 --> 01:20:33.779
In here with it.

01:20:40.592 --> 01:20:42.060
That will do.

01:20:49.267 --> 01:20:51.234
Do you steal,
Antoninus?

01:20:51.501 --> 01:20:52.867
No, master.

01:20:53.870 --> 01:20:55.236
Do you lie?

01:20:56.373 --> 01:20:58.238
Not if
I can avoid it.

01:20:59.775 --> 01:21:03.142
Have you ever
dishonored the gods?

01:21:03.244 --> 01:21:04.610
No, master.

01:21:05.947 --> 01:21:10.179
Do you refrain from these vices out
of respect for the moral virtues?

01:21:10.851 --> 01:21:12.250
Yes, master.

01:21:16.389 --> 01:21:18.118
Do you eat
oysters?

01:21:18.990 --> 01:21:20.981
When I have them,
master.

01:21:21.793 --> 01:21:23.454
Do you eat
snails?

01:21:24.495 --> 01:21:25.860
No, master.

01:21:27.865 --> 01:21:30.265
Do you consider the eating
of oysters to be moral

01:21:30.333 --> 01:21:33.030
and the eating of snails
to be immoral?

01:21:34.737 --> 01:21:36.102
No, master.

01:21:37.005 --> 01:21:38.496
Of course not.

01:21:41.742 --> 01:21:44.371
It is all a matter
of taste, isn't it?

01:21:44.846 --> 01:21:46.245
Yes, master.

01:21:47.547 --> 01:21:50.141
And taste is not
the same as appetite

01:21:50.750 --> 01:21:53.742
and therefore not a
question of morals, is it?

01:21:56.088 --> 01:21:57.146
Hmm?

01:21:59.724 --> 01:22:01.954
It could be
argued so, master.

01:22:05.362 --> 01:22:08.127
That will do.
My robe, Antoninus.

01:22:24.778 --> 01:22:26.678
My taste
includes

01:22:27.881 --> 01:22:30.350
both snails
and oysters.

01:22:39.657 --> 01:22:41.250
Antoninus, look.

01:22:42.626 --> 01:22:44.253
Across the river.

01:22:45.595 --> 01:22:47.927
There is something
you must see.

01:22:52.268 --> 01:22:55.031
There, boy,
is Rome.

01:22:56.437 --> 01:22:58.599
The might,
the majesty,

01:23:00.007 --> 01:23:01.736
the terror of Rome.

01:23:04.378 --> 01:23:08.211
There is the power that bestrides
the known world like a colossus.

01:23:09.949 --> 01:23:11.973
No man
can withstand Rome.

01:23:13.218 --> 01:23:15.345
No nation
can withstand her.

01:23:17.121 --> 01:23:18.588
How much less

01:23:20.024 --> 01:23:21.183
a boy?

01:23:23.626 --> 01:23:24.684
Hmm?

01:23:28.397 --> 01:23:31.594
There's only one way
to deal with Rome, Antoninus.

01:23:32.333 --> 01:23:34.062
You must serve her.

01:23:35.803 --> 01:23:38.294
You must abase yourself
before her.

01:23:40.707 --> 01:23:42.835
You must grovel at her feet.

01:23:45.244 --> 01:23:48.646
You must love her.

01:23:53.518 --> 01:23:55.508
Isn't that so, Antoninus?

01:23:59.389 --> 01:24:00.720
Antoninus!

01:24:03.993 --> 01:24:05.324
Antoninus?

01:25:38.470 --> 01:25:40.165
Take your time!

01:25:40.238 --> 01:25:41.671
How are they coming?
Good.

01:25:41.739 --> 01:25:44.641
Give me another thousand like
them and we can march on Rome.

01:25:44.742 --> 01:25:46.505
Come on,
once again.

01:26:02.723 --> 01:26:07.160
Here, on Vesuvius, we're safe from attack
while we organize ourselves into an army.

01:26:07.227 --> 01:26:09.559
It may take six months,
a year.

01:26:10.096 --> 01:26:13.361
Once we're strong, we're gonna
fight our way south to the sea.

01:26:13.433 --> 01:26:16.595
We're going to arrange for
ships with the Cilician pirates.

01:26:16.668 --> 01:26:18.898
The sea will be
our road home.

01:26:19.837 --> 01:26:22.067
If you agree,
you may join us.

01:26:22.239 --> 01:26:26.039
If you don't agree, go back
before your escape is discovered.

01:26:27.577 --> 01:26:29.102
Too many women.

01:26:29.679 --> 01:26:31.646
What's wrong
with women?

01:26:31.747 --> 01:26:34.011
Where would you be now,
you lout,

01:26:34.083 --> 01:26:36.551
if some woman hadn't fought
all the pains of hell

01:26:36.617 --> 01:26:38.609
to get you into
this accursed world?

01:26:38.686 --> 01:26:41.712
I can handle a knife in
the dark as well as anyone.

01:26:41.788 --> 01:26:43.984
I can cast spells
and brew poisons.

01:26:44.057 --> 01:26:47.151
I have made the death shrouds
for seven Roman masters.

01:26:49.395 --> 01:26:50.885
I want to see
Spartacus.

01:26:50.963 --> 01:26:53.192
All right, grandmother.
I'm Spartacus.

01:26:53.264 --> 01:26:54.630
Stay with us.

01:26:54.699 --> 01:26:58.225
We'll need a million Roman
shrouds before we're through.

01:27:01.438 --> 01:27:02.701
Where do you
come from?

01:27:02.773 --> 01:27:05.503
Most of us come
from the estate of Lillius.

01:27:05.575 --> 01:27:06.803
What kind of work
did you do there?

01:27:06.876 --> 01:27:09.105
Sixteen years a carpenter,
a mason.

01:27:09.177 --> 01:27:11.441
Good.
We can use carpenters.

01:27:13.682 --> 01:27:14.739
What kind of work
did you do?

01:27:14.815 --> 01:27:16.146
Chief steward.

01:27:16.217 --> 01:27:19.584
You'll help with the food
supplies. Report to Patullus.

01:27:20.620 --> 01:27:22.816
What kind of work
did you do?

01:27:23.857 --> 01:27:25.449
Singer of songs.

01:27:26.158 --> 01:27:27.751
Singer of songs?

01:27:27.960 --> 01:27:29.951
But what work
did you do?

01:27:30.295 --> 01:27:32.524
That's my work.
I also juggle.

01:27:33.297 --> 01:27:35.425
Juggle.
What else do you do?

01:27:35.967 --> 01:27:37.934
I can do
feats of magic.

01:27:38.368 --> 01:27:39.529
Magic?

01:27:40.771 --> 01:27:43.466
Maybe he can make
the Romans disappear.

01:29:10.878 --> 01:29:13.039
I'll need one volunteer,
man or woman.

01:29:13.112 --> 01:29:15.342
How about you?
You, sir?

01:29:16.349 --> 01:29:18.316
Here we have
a likely subject.

01:29:19.852 --> 01:29:22.945
You'll notice there is nothing
in my hand, true?

01:29:23.554 --> 01:29:25.420
How many fingers do you see?
Three.

01:29:25.489 --> 01:29:26.616
How many fingers
do you see?

01:29:26.691 --> 01:29:27.715
Three.

01:29:27.792 --> 01:29:31.853
I make a bowl. My hand is upside
down and I ask you to blow at it.

01:29:32.529 --> 01:29:34.326
Not hard enough.
Hard!

01:29:35.998 --> 01:29:37.227
Thank you.

01:29:44.838 --> 01:29:46.704
Would you like to try?

01:29:50.443 --> 01:29:52.775
Hit it against the rock,
gently.

01:30:00.819 --> 01:30:03.310
Poet, I haven't had
an egg in days.

01:30:04.688 --> 01:30:06.088
You haven't?

01:30:09.559 --> 01:30:11.186
Here.
Thank you.

01:30:11.961 --> 01:30:14.452
I'm not going to
let mine get away.

01:30:34.246 --> 01:30:35.713
Sing us a song.

01:30:35.780 --> 01:30:37.874
Sing us a song,
Antoninus.

01:30:38.283 --> 01:30:39.875
Sing, Antoninus.

01:30:43.153 --> 01:30:46.588
When the blazing sun hangs low
in the western sky,

01:30:48.557 --> 01:30:51.186
when the wind dies away
on the mountain,

01:30:53.895 --> 01:30:57.125
when the song
of the meadowlark turns still,

01:30:59.500 --> 01:31:02.696
when the field locust clicks
no more in the field,

01:31:04.837 --> 01:31:07.830
and the sea foam
sleeps like a maiden at rest,

01:31:08.640 --> 01:31:12.076
and twilight touches the shape
of the wondering earth,

01:31:12.544 --> 01:31:13.943
I turn home.

01:31:15.212 --> 01:31:17.807
Through blue shadows
and purple woods,

01:31:19.016 --> 01:31:20.415
I turn home.

01:31:21.918 --> 01:31:24.444
I turn to the place
that I was born,

01:31:24.721 --> 01:31:28.156
to the mother who bore me
and the father who taught me,

01:31:28.590 --> 01:31:32.321
long ago, long ago, long ago.

01:31:34.529 --> 01:31:38.829
Alone am I now, lost and alone
in a far, wide, wondering world.

01:31:40.667 --> 01:31:44.125
Yet still when the blazing sun
hangs low,

01:31:46.072 --> 01:31:49.165
when the wind dies away
and the sea foam sleeps,

01:31:50.775 --> 01:31:53.573
and twilight touches
the wondering earth,

01:31:55.446 --> 01:31:56.845
I turn home.

01:32:03.019 --> 01:32:05.146
Where'd you
learn that song?

01:32:05.921 --> 01:32:07.946
My father
taught it to me.

01:32:09.024 --> 01:32:11.151
I was wrong
about you, poet.

01:32:11.492 --> 01:32:13.859
You won't learn to kill.
You'll teach us songs.

01:32:13.928 --> 01:32:15.724
I came here to fight.

01:32:17.764 --> 01:32:19.789
Anyone
can learn to fight.

01:32:20.599 --> 01:32:22.260
I joined to fight.

01:32:26.204 --> 01:32:27.762
What's your name?

01:32:27.839 --> 01:32:29.306
Antoninus.

01:32:31.376 --> 01:32:32.706
Antoninus.

01:32:33.877 --> 01:32:37.142
There's a time for fighting
and a time for singing.

01:32:37.613 --> 01:32:39.604
Now you
teach us to sing.

01:32:40.182 --> 01:32:41.775
Sing, Antoninus.

01:32:48.722 --> 01:32:51.749
When the blazing sun hangs low
in the western sky...

01:32:53.727 --> 01:32:55.695
You like him,
don't you?

01:33:00.165 --> 01:33:01.894
Who wants to fight?

01:33:04.936 --> 01:33:07.131
An animal
can learn to fight.

01:33:10.673 --> 01:33:12.801
But to sing
beautiful things

01:33:14.444 --> 01:33:16.741
and make people
believe them...

01:33:19.081 --> 01:33:20.480
Hmm.

01:33:26.754 --> 01:33:28.881
What are you
thinking about?

01:33:36.462 --> 01:33:37.725
I'm free.

01:33:39.964 --> 01:33:41.694
And what do I know?

01:33:43.168 --> 01:33:45.397
I don't even know
how to read.

01:33:47.538 --> 01:33:50.131
You know things
that can't be taught.

01:33:52.542 --> 01:33:54.066
I know nothing.

01:33:54.977 --> 01:33:56.239
Nothing.

01:33:59.381 --> 01:34:02.782
And I want to know.
I want to...

01:34:06.553 --> 01:34:08.077
I want to know.

01:34:09.622 --> 01:34:10.954
Know what?

01:34:15.694 --> 01:34:17.059
Everything.

01:34:19.530 --> 01:34:22.227
Why a star falls
and a bird doesn't.

01:34:23.200 --> 01:34:25.327
Where the sun
goes at night.

01:34:26.036 --> 01:34:28.129
Why the moon
changes shape.

01:34:32.908 --> 01:34:35.706
I want to know
where the wind comes from.

01:34:42.816 --> 01:34:44.841
The wind
begins in a cave.

01:34:46.419 --> 01:34:49.980
Far to the north, a young
god sleeps in that cave.

01:34:51.456 --> 01:34:54.892
He dreams of a girl
and he sighs,

01:34:56.161 --> 01:34:59.357
and the night wind
stirs with his breath.

01:35:08.871 --> 01:35:11.066
I want to know
all about you.

01:35:14.509 --> 01:35:18.706
Every line,
every curve.

01:35:22.749 --> 01:35:25.149
I want to know
every part of you.

01:35:28.087 --> 01:35:30.077
Every beat
of your heart.

01:35:55.943 --> 01:35:58.434
Go on about
the city of Metapontum.

01:35:58.645 --> 01:36:01.079
What garrisons
will we find there?

01:36:02.682 --> 01:36:06.242
There are two legions in the
garrison. Some have been sent south...

01:36:06.318 --> 01:36:08.343
Set the litter down there.

01:36:24.300 --> 01:36:27.564
Well, where is this
slave general?

01:36:31.605 --> 01:36:33.698
Dionysius, get the litter
bearers out of the rain.

01:36:33.774 --> 01:36:36.503
Give them food,
a bed and their freedom.

01:36:38.411 --> 01:36:39.639
All right, follow me.

01:36:39.712 --> 01:36:41.476
We'll pay you
for them.

01:36:41.614 --> 01:36:43.945
We have no slaves
in this camp.

01:36:49.587 --> 01:36:52.021
Tigranes Levantus
at your service.

01:36:52.690 --> 01:36:54.247
My credentials.

01:36:59.127 --> 01:37:00.390
Come in.

01:37:03.899 --> 01:37:06.560
"To the General of the
Italian slaves called Spartacus

01:37:06.634 --> 01:37:09.660
"from Ibar M'hali,
Cilician Governor of Delos. "

01:37:09.736 --> 01:37:11.704
Sit down.
"Greetings.

01:37:11.771 --> 01:37:16.435
"Word has been received that you wish to
embark your armies on the Cilician ships

01:37:16.508 --> 01:37:18.670
"from the Italian port
of Brundusium.

01:37:18.744 --> 01:37:20.712
"Receive my agent,
Tigranes... "

01:37:20.779 --> 01:37:21.768
Levantus.

01:37:22.280 --> 01:37:23.713
"... who bargains
in my name.

01:37:23.781 --> 01:37:26.716
"May Isis and Serapis
bring victory to your cause.

01:37:26.783 --> 01:37:28.115
"The Governor of Delos. "

01:37:28.185 --> 01:37:30.119
Who are
Isis and Serapis?

01:37:30.187 --> 01:37:31.484
Gods of the East.

01:37:31.788 --> 01:37:34.086
Why should they
want us to win?

01:37:34.290 --> 01:37:37.953
Because
they favor Cilicia,

01:37:38.026 --> 01:37:41.189
and Cilicia, like you,
fights against the Romans.

01:37:45.499 --> 01:37:47.490
Would you like
some wine?

01:37:48.035 --> 01:37:51.937
I drink only after the bargain
has been concluded, never before.

01:38:00.578 --> 01:38:03.274
How many ships
do these Cilicians have?

01:38:03.347 --> 01:38:04.838
Five hundred, at least.

01:38:05.548 --> 01:38:07.676
But no deal is too small,
I assure you.

01:38:07.751 --> 01:38:09.514
We'll need them all.

01:38:10.086 --> 01:38:11.178
All?

01:38:11.253 --> 01:38:12.721
What is the price?

01:38:14.056 --> 01:38:18.287
Price is
100,000 sesterces per ship.

01:38:19.661 --> 01:38:22.561
For 500 ships,
that would be

01:38:23.597 --> 01:38:25.895
50 million sesterces.

01:38:27.401 --> 01:38:29.994
You have such a sum?

01:38:30.069 --> 01:38:31.161
We will have.

01:38:35.307 --> 01:38:36.934
See for yourself.

01:38:40.544 --> 01:38:41.909
Beautiful.

01:38:41.979 --> 01:38:43.276
When will the ships
be ready?

01:38:43.347 --> 01:38:44.745
Beautiful.

01:38:45.181 --> 01:38:47.411
I love to see
such beauty.

01:38:47.483 --> 01:38:49.679
When will the ships
be ready?

01:38:50.419 --> 01:38:53.684
Ah, my friend,
when will you be ready?

01:38:55.390 --> 01:38:57.358
How long
will it take you

01:38:59.193 --> 01:39:03.925
to cross one-third the length of Italy
fighting a major battle in every town?

01:39:03.997 --> 01:39:05.760
One year?
Two years?

01:39:06.665 --> 01:39:11.000
If we're not in Brundusium seven
months from now, we'll never be there.

01:39:13.271 --> 01:39:15.501
What if we
assemble the ships,

01:39:16.941 --> 01:39:20.137
and there is no longer
a slave army to board them?

01:39:21.211 --> 01:39:25.272
We'll give you a chest of treasure
now, the rest when we get to Brundusium.

01:39:25.348 --> 01:39:27.077
This one?
Yes.

01:39:28.983 --> 01:39:30.076
Done!

01:39:30.452 --> 01:39:33.649
Seven months from now
the ships will be assembled.

01:39:34.688 --> 01:39:37.089
Arrange to have
the chest loaded.

01:39:37.658 --> 01:39:39.023
And now,
with your permission,

01:39:39.093 --> 01:39:41.561
I should like to have
the wine you offered me.

01:39:41.627 --> 01:39:42.686
Will you join me?

01:39:42.762 --> 01:39:43.922
I will.

01:39:44.230 --> 01:39:45.856
Excellent workmanship.

01:39:45.931 --> 01:39:48.161
It came from the estate
of a wealthy nobleman.

01:39:48.233 --> 01:39:51.327
I've heard that you are
of noble birth yourself.

01:39:51.635 --> 01:39:53.604
I'm the son
and grandson of slaves.

01:39:53.704 --> 01:39:56.537
I knew that,
when I saw you couldn't read.

01:39:57.707 --> 01:40:01.439
Of course, it pleases Roman
vanity to think that you are noble.

01:40:01.511 --> 01:40:04.241
They shrink from the idea
of fighting mere slaves,

01:40:04.313 --> 01:40:06.543
especially a man
like Crassus.

01:40:08.516 --> 01:40:10.780
You know him?

01:40:10.852 --> 01:40:12.911
I entertained him
one afternoon.

01:40:13.353 --> 01:40:14.377
You?

01:40:14.454 --> 01:40:15.615
In the arena.

01:40:18.191 --> 01:40:19.715
Excellent wine.

01:40:21.660 --> 01:40:23.026
May I...

01:40:23.529 --> 01:40:25.360
May I ask you something?

01:40:25.430 --> 01:40:26.920
You can ask.

01:40:26.998 --> 01:40:30.092
Surely you know you're
going to lose, don't you?

01:40:32.035 --> 01:40:33.367
You have no chance.

01:40:33.437 --> 01:40:36.496
At this very moment, six
cohorts of the garrison of Rome

01:40:36.572 --> 01:40:38.802
are approaching
this position.

01:40:41.309 --> 01:40:43.301
What are you going to do?

01:40:48.382 --> 01:40:50.976
We'll decide that
when they get here.

01:40:55.288 --> 01:40:57.313
Let me put it differently.

01:40:57.490 --> 01:41:00.220
If you looked into
a magic crystal

01:41:01.059 --> 01:41:04.551
and you saw your army
destroyed and yourself dead,

01:41:05.296 --> 01:41:10.096
if you saw that in the future,
as I'm sure you're seeing it now,

01:41:10.534 --> 01:41:12.661
would you continue to fight?

01:41:13.503 --> 01:41:14.526
Yes.

01:41:14.603 --> 01:41:16.697
Knowing that you must lose?

01:41:17.907 --> 01:41:19.534
Knowing we can't.

01:41:21.075 --> 01:41:23.374
All men lose
when they die.

01:41:23.444 --> 01:41:27.471
And all men die, but a slave and
a free man lose different things.

01:41:27.548 --> 01:41:29.345
They both lose life.

01:41:29.416 --> 01:41:32.715
When a free man dies,
he loses the pleasure of life.

01:41:33.753 --> 01:41:35.653
A slave loses his pain.

01:41:37.689 --> 01:41:40.420
Death is the only freedom
a slave knows.

01:41:40.692 --> 01:41:43.092
That's why
he's not afraid of it.

01:41:45.095 --> 01:41:46.893
That's why we'll win.

01:42:15.521 --> 01:42:17.921
Spartacus,
that pirate was right.

01:42:20.191 --> 01:42:23.183
The garrison of Rome,
they're setting up camp.

01:42:24.261 --> 01:42:26.956
How many are there?
About six cohorts.

01:42:27.230 --> 01:42:28.356
Where?

01:42:28.431 --> 01:42:31.127
At the mouth of the valley,
against the cliffs.

01:42:34.002 --> 01:42:35.094
Strong camp?

01:42:35.170 --> 01:42:37.070
They've built
no stockade.

01:42:39.240 --> 01:42:40.673
No stockade?

01:42:41.108 --> 01:42:42.098
Are you sure?

01:42:42.176 --> 01:42:43.734
I'm very sure.

01:42:44.077 --> 01:42:46.739
This campaign
is great sport for them.

01:42:46.813 --> 01:42:49.076
The Romans
are having a picnic.

01:42:49.147 --> 01:42:50.206
Did they see you?

01:42:50.282 --> 01:42:51.772
No. We were hidden.

01:42:55.253 --> 01:42:57.983
Maybe we ought to join
this Roman picnic.

01:42:58.055 --> 01:42:59.546
Form your men.

01:43:05.495 --> 01:43:06.894
Six cohorts.

01:43:08.163 --> 01:43:12.691
A lot of arms and weapons
to build our army with.

01:43:40.623 --> 01:43:43.251
Crixus always wanted
to march on Rome.

01:43:44.294 --> 01:43:46.193
Now he doesn't have to.

01:43:46.962 --> 01:43:48.623
Rome's come to us.

01:44:54.818 --> 01:44:57.308
Half this way!
The rest over there.

01:45:18.504 --> 01:45:21.871
Stand up, the way
a noble Roman should!

01:45:22.207 --> 01:45:24.300
That's Roman pride
for you!

01:45:30.713 --> 01:45:32.204
That's better.

01:45:34.117 --> 01:45:35.744
What's your name?

01:45:36.518 --> 01:45:38.509
Marcus Glabrus.

01:45:39.054 --> 01:45:40.283
Glabrus.

01:45:41.156 --> 01:45:43.453
Commander
of the garrison of Rome.

01:45:44.191 --> 01:45:45.284
Commander?

01:45:45.359 --> 01:45:48.885
He was commanding it on his belly
when we found him, playing dead!

01:45:52.698 --> 01:45:55.133
You disappoint me,
Marcus Glabrus.

01:45:56.135 --> 01:45:57.602
Playing dead.

01:45:59.437 --> 01:46:01.098
You afraid to die?

01:46:03.007 --> 01:46:04.633
It's easy to die.

01:46:05.442 --> 01:46:07.137
Haven't you seen enough
gladiators in the arena

01:46:07.210 --> 01:46:09.405
to see
how easy it is to die?

01:46:09.979 --> 01:46:11.708
Of course you have.

01:46:12.348 --> 01:46:13.747
What are you...

01:46:14.749 --> 01:46:17.048
What are you
going to do to me?

01:46:17.118 --> 01:46:18.586
I don't know.

01:46:20.255 --> 01:46:21.653
What should we
do with him?

01:46:21.722 --> 01:46:24.418
Let's have a matched pair,
him and me.

01:46:26.325 --> 01:46:28.692
I'll not fight
like a gladiator!

01:46:34.066 --> 01:46:36.057
You keep staring at this.

01:46:36.802 --> 01:46:38.928
Do you recognize
this baton?

01:46:40.071 --> 01:46:41.698
Yes!
You should!

01:46:42.306 --> 01:46:44.069
It was in your tent.

01:46:46.209 --> 01:46:48.176
The symbol
of the Senate.

01:46:48.277 --> 01:46:50.177
All the power
of Rome!

01:46:53.248 --> 01:46:55.238
That's the power
of Rome!

01:46:58.119 --> 01:47:00.348
Take that back
to your Senate.

01:47:00.620 --> 01:47:04.716
Tell them you and that broken stick is
all that's left of the garrison of Rome!

01:47:04.791 --> 01:47:07.521
Tell them we want
nothing from Rome.

01:47:07.593 --> 01:47:10.221
Nothing,
except our freedom!

01:47:10.296 --> 01:47:13.162
All we want is to get out
of this damn country!

01:47:13.231 --> 01:47:15.529
We're marching south
to the sea.

01:47:15.600 --> 01:47:18.193
And we'll smash every army
they send against us.

01:47:18.268 --> 01:47:19.736
Put him on a horse!

01:50:19.750 --> 01:50:23.653
Their leader said their
hatred of Rome was such

01:50:23.721 --> 01:50:26.655
that all they wished was
to escape from her rule.

01:50:26.723 --> 01:50:30.715
If unopposed, he promised
a peaceful march to the sea.

01:50:30.792 --> 01:50:34.251
If opposed, he threatens
to ravage the countryside

01:50:34.329 --> 01:50:36.729
and destroy every legion
sent against him.

01:50:36.797 --> 01:50:38.732
And once they
get to the sea?

01:50:38.799 --> 01:50:43.327
They plan to take ship with Cilician
pirates and return to their homes.

01:50:43.403 --> 01:50:45.929
From which port
do they propose to embark?

01:50:46.006 --> 01:50:47.472
I don't know.

01:50:47.907 --> 01:50:50.432
But city garrisons
can't stand up to them.

01:50:50.509 --> 01:50:53.500
If they are to be intercepted,
it's work for the legions!

01:50:53.578 --> 01:50:56.673
What sort of a man is
this leader of the slaves?

01:50:57.248 --> 01:50:58.942
I don't know.

01:50:59.383 --> 01:51:01.817
I think
they called him Spartacus.

01:51:03.053 --> 01:51:04.383
Spartacus.

01:51:05.955 --> 01:51:07.821
Is that name
familiar to you?

01:51:09.524 --> 01:51:11.492
Yes, it does
seem to be.

01:51:12.527 --> 01:51:14.154
I can't place it.

01:51:14.930 --> 01:51:17.557
After he talked to you,
what happened?

01:51:18.098 --> 01:51:21.033
I was tied to a horse
and lashed out of camp.

01:51:23.169 --> 01:51:25.570
How many of your company
escaped?

01:51:26.505 --> 01:51:28.803
Fourteen
have reported thus far.

01:51:28.874 --> 01:51:32.036
I, myself, was taken prisoner
in my own command tent.

01:51:32.109 --> 01:51:36.342
The camp was thoroughly infiltrated
before an alarm could be sounded.

01:51:37.314 --> 01:51:41.011
Did you surround your camp
with moat and stockade?

01:51:49.624 --> 01:51:50.648
No.

01:51:52.226 --> 01:51:56.287
We arrived after sunset. Sentries
were posted every 10 paces.

01:51:56.363 --> 01:51:59.526
There was no reason
to expect an attack by night.

01:52:00.032 --> 01:52:02.968
Then again,
well, they...

01:52:06.171 --> 01:52:07.434
Continue.

01:52:10.075 --> 01:52:11.940
They were only slaves.

01:52:15.312 --> 01:52:16.472
I see.

01:52:19.315 --> 01:52:23.478
I submit that Publius Marcus Glabrus
has disgraced the arms of Rome.

01:52:24.720 --> 01:52:27.779
Let the punishment of
the Senate be pronounced.

01:52:32.793 --> 01:52:35.887
If we punished every commander
who made a fool of himself,

01:52:35.962 --> 01:52:39.397
we wouldn't have anyone left
above the rank of centurion.

01:52:40.666 --> 01:52:43.601
But this is a case
of criminal carelessness!

01:52:44.068 --> 01:52:46.503
Six cohorts
have been slaughtered.

01:52:46.971 --> 01:52:51.601
Crassus sponsored this young
man. Let him pronounce sentence.

01:52:55.544 --> 01:52:57.740
The punishment
is well-known!

01:53:00.016 --> 01:53:04.384
Let Publius Marcus Glabrus be
denied fire, water, food and shelter

01:53:04.452 --> 01:53:07.785
for a distance of 400 miles in all
directions from the city of Rome.

01:53:12.725 --> 01:53:14.250
One thing more.

01:53:14.927 --> 01:53:19.364
Glabrus is my friend and I will not
dissociate myself from his disgrace.

01:53:19.498 --> 01:53:24.230
I now lay down the command of my
legions and retire to private life.

01:53:36.879 --> 01:53:38.506
Goodbye, Crassus.

01:53:40.715 --> 01:53:44.913
This is no time for a man of honor
to withdraw from public affairs!

01:53:44.986 --> 01:53:46.418
All: Shame, shame!

01:53:46.486 --> 01:53:47.954
Sit down.

01:53:48.255 --> 01:53:51.747
This sort of heroic public
behavior is nothing new.

01:53:51.824 --> 01:53:54.657
I've seen it before,
and I know the meaning of it.

01:53:54.727 --> 01:53:56.421
Crassus acted
on a point of honor!

01:53:56.494 --> 01:53:58.019
Patrician honor!

01:53:58.863 --> 01:54:01.298
No matter how noble
this looks from the outside,

01:54:01.366 --> 01:54:03.390
I don't like
the color of it.

01:54:03.467 --> 01:54:05.435
Crassus is
the only man in Rome

01:54:05.502 --> 01:54:09.461
who hasn't yielded to republican
corruption and never will!

01:54:09.539 --> 01:54:13.736
I'll take a little republican corruption
along with a little republican freedom

01:54:13.809 --> 01:54:17.768
but I won't take
the dictatorship of Crassus

01:54:17.846 --> 01:54:20.177
and no freedom at all!

01:54:22.249 --> 01:54:26.515
That's what he's out for
and that's why he'll be back.

01:58:17.942 --> 01:58:20.934
To the mother
that bore me,

01:58:22.446 --> 01:58:25.074
to the father
that taught me,

01:58:26.883 --> 01:58:28.374
to the god...

01:58:31.654 --> 01:58:35.089
To the blue woods and
the purple shadows, I...

01:58:35.156 --> 01:58:37.682
To blue shadows
and purple woods.

01:58:38.459 --> 01:58:40.358
Spartacus,
you frightened me!

01:58:40.427 --> 01:58:41.792
I'm sorry.

01:58:44.564 --> 01:58:45.997
How long
have you been there?

01:58:46.065 --> 01:58:47.624
A little while.

01:58:48.934 --> 01:58:50.766
Why didn't you
say something?

01:58:50.836 --> 01:58:52.804
You seemed so happy.
I didn't want to bother you.

01:58:52.871 --> 01:58:54.270
I am happy.

01:58:55.507 --> 01:58:59.169
Spartacus, I've been trying to
remember the song that Antoninus sang.

01:58:59.243 --> 01:59:04.237
Is it blue shadows and purple woods,
or is it purple woods and blue shadows?

01:59:04.647 --> 01:59:06.741
I want to make love
to my wife!

01:59:09.618 --> 01:59:11.086
Spartacus, put me down.
I'm dripping!

01:59:11.153 --> 01:59:12.416
I don't care.

01:59:13.654 --> 01:59:14.951
You've got, you've...

01:59:15.022 --> 01:59:16.012
Yes?

01:59:16.524 --> 01:59:18.617
You have to be gentle
with me.

01:59:18.893 --> 01:59:20.985
Why?
Why, darling?

01:59:22.228 --> 01:59:25.095
I'm going to have a baby.
Now put me down.

01:59:28.000 --> 01:59:29.092
What?

01:59:31.602 --> 01:59:32.797
A baby.

01:59:37.741 --> 01:59:39.209
A baby? When?

01:59:42.445 --> 01:59:43.935
In the spring.

01:59:46.482 --> 01:59:49.507
Well, how? I mean,
how do you know?

01:59:50.085 --> 01:59:51.450
I know.

01:59:52.486 --> 01:59:54.284
A baby in the spring.

01:59:56.490 --> 01:59:57.888
I'm gonna have a son.

01:59:57.957 --> 01:59:59.322
It might be a daughter.

01:59:59.392 --> 02:00:01.383
Why didn't you tell me?
I just did.

02:00:01.461 --> 02:00:04.054
You're cold.
Here, get underneath this.

02:00:05.297 --> 02:00:06.890
Did I hurt you?
No, you didn't.

02:00:06.965 --> 02:00:08.592
I didn't mean
to be so rough.

02:00:08.667 --> 02:00:10.225
Why don't you kiss me?

02:00:10.301 --> 02:00:13.430
This is the first time I was
ever going to have a baby.

02:00:13.504 --> 02:00:14.834
Varinia.

02:00:18.775 --> 02:00:19.970
A baby.

02:00:20.976 --> 02:00:23.877
I'm just the same
as I ever was, Spartacus.

02:00:34.254 --> 02:00:35.745
I won't break.

02:01:05.446 --> 02:01:10.042
These slaves have already cost
us a thousand million sesterces.

02:01:10.117 --> 02:01:14.212
If now they want to relieve us
of their unwelcome presence,

02:01:14.287 --> 02:01:16.380
let them go!
Lmpossible.

02:01:16.455 --> 02:01:18.821
They've infected half of
Italy with this uprising.

02:01:18.891 --> 02:01:20.882
If we permit them
to escape,

02:01:20.959 --> 02:01:23.951
this will spread
throughout the entire empire.

02:01:29.699 --> 02:01:32.168
The Republic

02:01:33.335 --> 02:01:36.396
is still weak
from 20 years of civil strife.

02:01:36.472 --> 02:01:38.963
We're engaged
in two wars,

02:01:39.507 --> 02:01:42.101
one in Spain
and the other in Asia.

02:01:42.944 --> 02:01:46.777
Pirates have cut off
our Egyptian grain supply,

02:01:47.080 --> 02:01:50.948
and Spartacus raids the
commerce of all south Italy.

02:01:51.851 --> 02:01:56.219
Half the precincts of Rome
are without bread!

02:01:57.222 --> 02:01:59.315
The city is
close to panic.

02:02:01.192 --> 02:02:03.888
There are two things
we must do immediately!

02:02:03.961 --> 02:02:07.760
Confirm Caesar as permanent
commander of the garrison

02:02:09.465 --> 02:02:11.058
And...

02:02:11.567 --> 02:02:14.058
And assign two legions

02:02:14.136 --> 02:02:19.039
to intercept and destroy Spartacus
at the city of Metapontum!

02:03:25.394 --> 02:03:28.227
If we could only have had
Batiatus in the other pot!

02:03:28.297 --> 02:03:30.992
Now you're talking!
Varinia, wonderful meal.

02:03:31.799 --> 02:03:32.789
Varinia.

02:03:32.867 --> 02:03:35.927
A small piece of land
with a few goats on it.

02:03:36.003 --> 02:03:37.061
Oh, no, no.

02:03:37.137 --> 02:03:38.229
I don't care.

02:03:38.305 --> 02:03:39.795
The best wine
in the world.

02:03:39.873 --> 02:03:42.102
For wine,
you've got to go to Aquitania.

02:03:45.378 --> 02:03:47.846
Come to Lidya for wine.
That's the best.

02:03:47.913 --> 02:03:49.744
The best wine
comes from Greece.

02:03:49.814 --> 02:03:52.009
Everybody knows that,
even the Romans!

02:03:52.082 --> 02:03:53.744
No, Lidya!

02:03:57.287 --> 02:03:58.345
You're all wrong!

02:03:58.421 --> 02:04:00.651
The best wine comes from home,
wherever it is.

02:04:00.723 --> 02:04:02.020
I agree with you.

02:04:24.310 --> 02:04:25.640
Gentlemen.

02:04:26.711 --> 02:04:28.475
Any reports
on Metapontum?

02:04:28.546 --> 02:04:30.343
Heralds are crying
the news now.

02:04:30.414 --> 02:04:33.440
We lost 10,000 men, including
Commodius and his officers.

02:04:33.517 --> 02:04:35.178
Nineteen thousand?

02:04:37.820 --> 02:04:39.515
Have you estates
in Metapontum?

02:04:39.855 --> 02:04:40.879
No.

02:04:41.057 --> 02:04:42.853
A son with Commodius.

02:04:44.225 --> 02:04:46.524
With your permission,
good day.

02:04:48.996 --> 02:04:52.455
We take five years
to train a legion.

02:04:52.533 --> 02:04:56.764
How can this Spartacus train
an army in seven months?

02:04:56.836 --> 02:04:59.634
There's something wrong,
something very wrong.

02:05:00.238 --> 02:05:01.797
We should have
an investigation.

02:05:01.873 --> 02:05:03.364
By all means,
an investigation.

02:05:03.442 --> 02:05:04.772
Where is
Spartacus now?

02:05:04.842 --> 02:05:07.607
He's nearing the seaport of Brundusium.

02:05:07.678 --> 02:05:10.442
I need a few moments
of the Commander's time.

02:05:10.513 --> 02:05:12.243
Will you excuse us?

02:05:17.586 --> 02:05:21.988
I hear you've taken a house
in the fourth ward.

02:05:22.690 --> 02:05:24.715
Not a very
splendid house.

02:05:25.259 --> 02:05:28.023
And you feasted 11,000
plebeians in the Field of Mars.

02:05:28.095 --> 02:05:30.621
It scarcely could've been
called a feast.

02:05:31.365 --> 02:05:33.594
For 200 years, your family
and mine have been members

02:05:33.666 --> 02:05:36.829
of the Equestrian Order
and the Patrician Party,

02:05:36.902 --> 02:05:38.836
servants and rulers
of Rome.

02:05:39.971 --> 02:05:42.497
Why have you left us
for Gracchus and the mob?

02:05:42.574 --> 02:05:45.099
I've left no one,
least of all Rome.

02:05:45.676 --> 02:05:49.737
But this much I've learned
from Gracchus, Rome is the mob.

02:05:49.812 --> 02:05:50.836
No!

02:05:51.714 --> 02:05:54.706
Rome is an eternal thought
in the mind of God.

02:05:55.450 --> 02:05:57.976
I had no idea
you'd grown religious.

02:05:58.420 --> 02:06:00.114
That doesn't matter.

02:06:00.187 --> 02:06:02.850
If there were no gods at all,
I'd revere them.

02:06:02.923 --> 02:06:06.359
If there were no Rome,
I'd dream of her

02:06:06.426 --> 02:06:08.189
as I want you
to do.

02:06:09.696 --> 02:06:12.494
I want you to come back
to your own kind.

02:06:12.798 --> 02:06:14.266
I beg you to.

02:06:15.401 --> 02:06:18.199
Is it me you want,
or is it the garrison?

02:06:19.103 --> 02:06:20.196
Both.

02:06:20.638 --> 02:06:22.230
Tell me frankly.

02:06:22.305 --> 02:06:25.366
If you were I, would you take
the field against Spartacus?

02:06:25.442 --> 02:06:27.035
Of course.
Why?

02:06:27.309 --> 02:06:29.642
We have no other choice
if we're to save Rome.

02:06:29.712 --> 02:06:31.441
Ah, Caesar!

02:06:31.947 --> 02:06:33.312
Which Rome?

02:06:33.681 --> 02:06:34.876
Theirs

02:06:35.650 --> 02:06:36.913
or ours?

02:06:40.688 --> 02:06:42.986
You know Gracchus
is my friend.

02:06:44.957 --> 02:06:46.687
I won't betray him.

02:06:48.628 --> 02:06:49.821
Caesar?

02:06:53.965 --> 02:06:56.695
Which is worse? To betray a
friend or betray Rome herself?

02:06:56.767 --> 02:06:58.997
My dear Crassus,
I face no such choice.

02:06:59.070 --> 02:07:01.594
You will,
sooner than you think.

02:07:03.506 --> 02:07:06.771
Good afternoon, Crassus.
I've been looking for you.

02:07:07.009 --> 02:07:08.602
Your new master.

02:07:11.480 --> 02:07:14.574
The Senate's been in session all day
over this business with Spartacus.

02:07:14.649 --> 02:07:17.777
We've got eight legions
and no one to lead them.

02:07:18.418 --> 02:07:20.182
The minute you offer
the general's command,

02:07:20.253 --> 02:07:22.847
they start wheezing
like winded mules.

02:07:22.922 --> 02:07:25.288
I've seen such epidemics
before, haven't you?

02:07:25.357 --> 02:07:26.347
How's your health?

02:07:26.425 --> 02:07:27.449
Excellent, as you
very well know.

02:07:27.526 --> 02:07:30.154
I take it the Senate's now
offering the command to me.

02:07:30.228 --> 02:07:31.491
You've been
expecting it.

02:07:31.563 --> 02:07:32.791
I have.

02:07:32.864 --> 02:07:35.559
Have you thought how costly
my services might be?

02:07:35.632 --> 02:07:37.066
We buy everything else
these days.

02:07:37.134 --> 02:07:39.227
No reason why we shouldn't
be charged for patriotism.

02:07:39.303 --> 02:07:40.895
What's your fee?

02:07:43.339 --> 02:07:47.605
My election as First Consul,
command of all the legions of Italy,

02:07:48.210 --> 02:07:51.838
and the abolition of senatorial
authority over the courts.

02:07:52.113 --> 02:07:53.580
Dictatorship.

02:07:54.682 --> 02:07:55.842
Order.

02:07:57.984 --> 02:07:59.577
Let me know if my terms
are acceptable.

02:07:59.652 --> 02:08:02.143
I can tell you now.
They're unacceptable.

02:08:02.888 --> 02:08:06.324
For the present, perhaps, but
times change and so does the Senate.

02:08:06.391 --> 02:08:08.222
When that day comes,
I shall be ready.

02:08:08.292 --> 02:08:09.589
Convey my respects
to your wife.

02:08:09.660 --> 02:08:11.458
With pleasure.

02:08:13.997 --> 02:08:15.761
He's right,
you know.

02:08:15.832 --> 02:08:18.528
If something isn't done about
Spartacus, the Senate will change.

02:08:18.601 --> 02:08:23.504
And Crassus will save Rome from the
slave army by assuming dictatorship.

02:08:26.207 --> 02:08:29.302
But that depends on which way
Spartacus jumps.

02:08:29.377 --> 02:08:31.174
Just now he's trying
to get out of Italy.

02:08:31.245 --> 02:08:34.044
If he succeeds,
the crisis is over

02:08:34.114 --> 02:08:37.208
and Crassus may stay
in retirement indefinitely.

02:08:37.683 --> 02:08:40.811
I've arranged for Spartacus
to escape from Italy.

02:08:40.886 --> 02:08:42.114
What?

02:08:42.487 --> 02:08:45.354
I've made a little deal
with the Cilician pirates.

02:08:45.423 --> 02:08:47.448
I've assured them
that we won't interfere

02:08:47.525 --> 02:08:51.052
if they transport Spartacus
and his slaves out of Italy.

02:08:52.862 --> 02:08:55.161
So now we
deal with pirates.

02:08:55.799 --> 02:08:57.561
We bargain with criminals.

02:08:57.633 --> 02:09:01.831
Don't be so stiff-necked.
Politics is a practical profession.

02:09:01.904 --> 02:09:05.532
If a criminal has what you
want, you do business with him.

02:09:42.403 --> 02:09:44.701
How far are we
from Brundusium?

02:09:45.272 --> 02:09:46.797
About
20 miles.

02:09:48.007 --> 02:09:51.739
Our army will camp here tonight.
They're six hours behind us.

02:09:51.811 --> 02:09:56.009
Patullus, ride ahead to
Brundusium. Bring Tigranes here.

02:09:56.081 --> 02:09:59.016
Marco, report back
to Spartacus.

02:09:59.083 --> 02:10:01.609
Tell him we camp tonight
by the sea!

02:10:43.419 --> 02:10:45.410
If all goes well,

02:10:45.488 --> 02:10:47.650
we can load
150 ships a day.

02:10:47.724 --> 02:10:50.590
That's your job, Dionysius.
Work with the Cilician pirates.

02:10:50.659 --> 02:10:52.320
That ought to
keep him busy.

02:10:52.394 --> 02:10:54.589
Saves me finding
someplace to sleep.

02:10:54.662 --> 02:10:57.131
Crixus, keep giving me
reports on Pompey.

02:10:57.198 --> 02:10:58.666
There won't be
any surprises.

02:10:58.733 --> 02:11:02.395
I still want patrols up to the
time we call them to board ship.

02:11:02.469 --> 02:11:04.403
I'll get them together.
Spartacus,

02:11:04.471 --> 02:11:07.405
the harbor district in
Brundusium has food warehouses,

02:11:07.473 --> 02:11:10.033
but not enough to provide
for the whole fleet.

02:11:10.109 --> 02:11:11.905
The countryside's
filled with cattle.

02:11:11.976 --> 02:11:13.876
We've salt
to preserve them.

02:11:13.945 --> 02:11:15.310
I'll handle it.

02:11:15.980 --> 02:11:19.814
Find out how many men we have in camp
who were galley slaves or sailors.

02:11:19.883 --> 02:11:21.749
Tigranes Levantus.

02:11:21.852 --> 02:11:23.250
Ah!

02:11:24.453 --> 02:11:25.546
My dear General.

02:11:25.621 --> 02:11:26.850
Welcome, Tigranes.

02:11:27.390 --> 02:11:31.416
No, no. You needn't look for litter
bearers to emancipate. I rode a horse.

02:11:31.493 --> 02:11:34.586
Your gods, Isis and Serapis
must've been good to us.

02:11:35.829 --> 02:11:39.128
The balance of the 50 million
sesterces we owe you.

02:11:40.833 --> 02:11:42.324
General, I...

02:11:43.036 --> 02:11:46.095
I bear a heavy burden
of evil tidings.

02:11:49.274 --> 02:11:50.638
What is it?

02:11:52.510 --> 02:11:55.535
Pompey and his army
has landed in Italy.

02:11:55.979 --> 02:11:58.675
At the port of Rhegium
three days ago.

02:11:58.748 --> 02:12:01.011
We get complete reports
on their movements.

02:12:01.083 --> 02:12:02.915
But do you also know

02:12:02.985 --> 02:12:05.920
that a Roman fleet
carrying Lucullus and his army

02:12:05.988 --> 02:12:08.319
arrives tomorrow
at Brundusium?

02:12:10.758 --> 02:12:11.952
Lucullus, here?

02:12:12.025 --> 02:12:13.721
You have no ships.

02:12:17.630 --> 02:12:19.655
I saw them in the harbor.

02:12:21.267 --> 02:12:25.066
The Cilician fleet,
out of strategic necessity,

02:12:25.136 --> 02:12:27.833
has been obliged
to withdraw.

02:12:29.073 --> 02:12:30.563
Withdraw?

02:12:30.808 --> 02:12:32.708
There are
no ships at all?

02:12:40.749 --> 02:12:44.583
Cilician pirates can destroy
any Roman fleet that ever sailed.

02:12:45.353 --> 02:12:47.913
If they run away now, it's
not because they're afraid!

02:12:47.989 --> 02:12:49.320
You better give me
a better reason.

02:12:49.390 --> 02:12:51.482
I'm as desolated
as you are, General.

02:12:51.558 --> 02:12:53.185
Stand up. Up!

02:12:54.894 --> 02:12:56.385
On your toes.

02:13:00.366 --> 02:13:01.833
You'll cut the skin.

02:13:01.900 --> 02:13:04.198
Why did the Cilicians
run away?

02:13:04.502 --> 02:13:06.027
They were paid.

02:13:06.938 --> 02:13:09.838
And who paid them?
Who?

02:13:10.941 --> 02:13:12.170
Crassus.

02:13:15.911 --> 02:13:17.140
Crassus.

02:13:18.381 --> 02:13:20.678
Crassus won't
fight us himself.

02:13:20.982 --> 02:13:23.952
The reports say he won't take
the command of an army.

02:13:24.318 --> 02:13:27.481
Why would he bribe your pirates
to keep us from escaping?

02:13:27.554 --> 02:13:28.749
I don't know.

02:13:28.822 --> 02:13:32.986
How can I answer, when there is no answer?
I've been betrayed just as you have.

02:13:33.059 --> 02:13:34.788
There is an answer.

02:13:36.027 --> 02:13:38.656
There must be an answer
to everything.

02:13:39.998 --> 02:13:42.091
Five miles
from Brundusium.

02:13:44.268 --> 02:13:45.793
Here's Rhegium.

02:13:47.003 --> 02:13:50.166
Pompey's march must've
brought him to about here.

02:13:50.273 --> 02:13:52.866
He's four days away,
maybe more.

02:13:54.576 --> 02:13:57.239
Lucullus lands
at Brundusium tomorrow.

02:13:57.812 --> 02:13:59.940
If we engage Lucullus,

02:14:00.014 --> 02:14:03.109
Pompey will have time
to march against our rear.

02:14:04.584 --> 02:14:06.917
If we turn west
to meet Pompey,

02:14:08.754 --> 02:14:11.348
Lucullus will march
against our rear.

02:14:12.691 --> 02:14:17.025
The only other army
in all of Italy is here.

02:14:17.395 --> 02:14:18.487
Rome.

02:14:19.664 --> 02:14:21.324
Yes, of course!

02:14:21.832 --> 02:14:24.699
Crassus is inviting us
to march on Rome,

02:14:24.768 --> 02:14:27.066
so he can take the field
against us.

02:14:27.570 --> 02:14:29.334
Crassus wants us
to march on Rome?

02:14:29.405 --> 02:14:30.429
He's forcing us to.

02:14:30.506 --> 02:14:35.204
He knows I won't let myself be trapped
between two armies with my back to the sea.

02:14:35.277 --> 02:14:37.904
He knows my only
other choice is Rome.

02:14:39.447 --> 02:14:41.677
Somewhere on the way,
we meet.

02:14:42.348 --> 02:14:45.341
If he beats us,
he becomes the savior of Rome,

02:14:45.418 --> 02:14:47.647
and there's his final victory
over the Senate.

02:14:47.719 --> 02:14:52.316
General, allow me to
redeem myself in your eyes.

02:14:53.058 --> 02:14:54.320
For a small commission,

02:14:54.392 --> 02:14:59.352
I can arrange for you, your
family and your leaders, of course,

02:14:59.429 --> 02:15:02.660
to be smuggled out of Italy and
transported to one of the eastern countries

02:15:02.732 --> 02:15:05.530
where men like you are welcome
and appreciated.

02:15:05.601 --> 02:15:08.502
You can live like kings
for the rest of your lives.

02:15:08.571 --> 02:15:10.663
What do you think,
General?

02:15:11.005 --> 02:15:12.234
Go away.

02:15:14.042 --> 02:15:15.271
Go away?

02:15:18.879 --> 02:15:20.108
Go away.

02:15:29.187 --> 02:15:31.713
Tell the trumpeters
to sound assembly.

02:15:39.662 --> 02:15:43.655
Tonight, a Roman army lands
in the harbor of Brundusium.

02:15:44.933 --> 02:15:47.869
Another army is approaching us
from the west.

02:15:48.103 --> 02:15:52.335
Between them, they hope to
trap us here, against the sea.

02:15:52.807 --> 02:15:56.504
The Cilician pirates have
betrayed us. We have no ships.

02:15:56.643 --> 02:15:59.135
"By order of the Senate

02:15:59.880 --> 02:16:03.508
"be it known that we
have this day elected

02:16:03.582 --> 02:16:06.380
"Marcus Licinius Crassus

02:16:06.951 --> 02:16:09.318
"First Consul of the Republic

02:16:09.387 --> 02:16:13.584
"and Commander-in-Chief
of the armies of Rome. "

02:16:13.991 --> 02:16:16.426
Hail Crassus!

02:16:17.093 --> 02:16:20.825
Rome will not allow us
to escape from Italy.

02:16:22.464 --> 02:16:25.729
We have no choice but to
march against Rome herself

02:16:26.501 --> 02:16:29.697
and end this war the only way
it could have ended.

02:16:30.371 --> 02:16:33.965
By freeing every slave
in Italy.

02:16:34.340 --> 02:16:37.969
I promise you a new Rome,

02:16:39.011 --> 02:16:41.480
a new Italy and a new empire.

02:16:42.147 --> 02:16:45.638
I promise the destruction
of the slave army

02:16:45.716 --> 02:16:50.675
and the restoration of order
throughout all our territories.

02:16:51.254 --> 02:16:54.815
I'd rather be here,
a free man among brothers,

02:16:55.392 --> 02:16:58.360
facing a long march
and a hard fight,

02:16:58.459 --> 02:17:01.691
than to be the richest
citizen of Rome,

02:17:02.129 --> 02:17:04.724
fat with food
he didn't work for,

02:17:05.333 --> 02:17:07.266
and surrounded by slaves.

02:17:07.601 --> 02:17:10.228
I promise the living body
of Spartacus

02:17:10.938 --> 02:17:13.735
for whatever punishment
you may deem fit.

02:17:14.440 --> 02:17:16.932
That, or his head.

02:17:18.709 --> 02:17:22.077
This I vow by the spirits
of all my forefathers.

02:17:23.315 --> 02:17:25.111
This I have sworn

02:17:26.116 --> 02:17:28.779
in the temple that guards
their bones.

02:17:30.386 --> 02:17:32.651
Hail Crassus!

02:17:33.056 --> 02:17:35.352
We've traveled
a long ways together.

02:17:36.124 --> 02:17:40.254
We've fought many battles
and won great victories.

02:17:41.028 --> 02:17:44.931
Now instead of taking ship
for our homes across the sea,

02:17:45.832 --> 02:17:47.925
we must fight again.

02:17:49.068 --> 02:17:53.664
Maybe there's no peace in this
world, for us or for anyone else.

02:17:53.739 --> 02:17:55.138
I don't know.

02:17:56.174 --> 02:18:00.110
But I do know
that as long as we live,

02:18:00.844 --> 02:18:03.279
we must stay true
to ourselves.

02:18:05.415 --> 02:18:07.645
I do know that we're brothers.

02:18:08.517 --> 02:18:10.611
And I know that we're free.

02:18:17.859 --> 02:18:19.155
We march tonight!

02:19:53.171 --> 02:19:55.036
Hail Crassus!
Hail Crassus!

02:19:56.039 --> 02:19:57.939
Greetings to you,
Crassus.

02:19:58.008 --> 02:20:00.533
Caius. Gentlemen.

02:20:01.944 --> 02:20:03.708
Have your dispositions
been made?

02:20:03.779 --> 02:20:07.943
Each maniple knows its position,
sir, and exactly what's expected.

02:20:08.383 --> 02:20:11.909
Every legion commander has
been given his battle orders.

02:20:12.352 --> 02:20:15.083
Excellent. All positions
will now be changed.

02:20:15.155 --> 02:20:16.383
Changed?

02:20:17.223 --> 02:20:20.853
Spartacus takes too keen an
interest in our plans, I fear.

02:20:21.693 --> 02:20:24.890
New battle orders will be
issued in a short while.

02:20:27.732 --> 02:20:31.691
Spartacus has every reason to
believe that he has outdistanced

02:20:31.769 --> 02:20:34.601
the pursuing armies
of Pompey and Lucullus.

02:20:35.372 --> 02:20:40.308
However, there are passes through the
Apennine Mountains unknown to any map.

02:20:42.411 --> 02:20:46.142
It may fortify your courage
to know

02:20:46.814 --> 02:20:50.443
that Pompey is encamped
some 20 miles to the west

02:20:51.118 --> 02:20:54.053
and that the army of Lucullus
approaches from the south

02:20:54.121 --> 02:20:56.088
by forced night march.

02:20:56.155 --> 02:21:00.352
Sir, allow us to pledge you the
most glorious victory of your career.

02:21:00.425 --> 02:21:01.483
Aye!

02:21:02.360 --> 02:21:04.158
I'm not after glory!

02:21:05.363 --> 02:21:07.126
I'm after Spartacus.

02:21:08.465 --> 02:21:10.957
And, gentlemen,
I mean to have him.

02:21:12.435 --> 02:21:15.871
However, this campaign is
not alone to kill Spartacus.

02:21:16.906 --> 02:21:19.533
It is to kill
the legend of Spartacus.

02:21:21.977 --> 02:21:23.739
You may go, gentlemen.

02:21:23.811 --> 02:21:25.939
Hail Crassus.
Hail Crassus.

02:21:28.581 --> 02:21:30.777
Lentulus Batiatus
awaits Your Excellency.

02:21:30.850 --> 02:21:32.841
Who?
The lanista, sir.

02:21:33.520 --> 02:21:35.578
Ah! Admit him.

02:21:38.924 --> 02:21:40.186
Most Blessed Highness,

02:21:40.258 --> 02:21:43.694
as soon as I received your message I
hurried into your distinguished presence.

02:21:43.761 --> 02:21:46.821
I'm glad you were able
to spare the time. Sit down.

02:21:46.897 --> 02:21:48.922
Oh, how gracious.

02:21:50.432 --> 02:21:52.799
I understand...
I'm informed

02:21:53.602 --> 02:21:55.968
that Spartacus once trained
under your auspices.

02:21:56.037 --> 02:21:57.095
Yes!

02:21:57.172 --> 02:22:01.074
In fact, if it isn't too
subversive to say so,

02:22:01.142 --> 02:22:03.610
I made him
what he is today.

02:22:04.244 --> 02:22:06.338
You're to be
congratulated.

02:22:06.747 --> 02:22:10.011
You're so
admirably qualified

02:22:10.550 --> 02:22:13.450
to give me what up to now
I've not been able to obtain,

02:22:13.518 --> 02:22:15.452
a physical description
of Spartacus.

02:22:15.520 --> 02:22:16.749
Oh, yes.

02:22:18.622 --> 02:22:20.215
But you saw him.

02:22:21.292 --> 02:22:23.021
What?
In the ring.

02:22:24.828 --> 02:22:25.920
When?

02:22:26.663 --> 02:22:30.291
When you visited my school
with those two charming ladies.

02:22:32.234 --> 02:22:33.326
What!

02:22:34.336 --> 02:22:36.633
I trust they're both
in good health.

02:22:36.704 --> 02:22:39.799
They selected him to fight
against Draba, the negro.

02:22:39.874 --> 02:22:41.306
I remember the negro.

02:22:41.374 --> 02:22:44.970
You had good cause to.
If I... If I may say so,

02:22:45.512 --> 02:22:48.139
a brilliant dagger thrust,
difficult angle.

02:22:48.214 --> 02:22:49.340
Spartacus
was the opponent?

02:22:49.415 --> 02:22:50.405
Yes.

02:22:52.851 --> 02:22:54.716
What did he
look like?

02:22:55.520 --> 02:22:58.079
That's a matter of some
importance to Your Highness?

02:22:58.155 --> 02:23:01.989
Yes, to every man who loves Rome
and wishes to see her strong.

02:23:03.259 --> 02:23:07.025
We're both Roman patriots. You're
a great one. I, of course, smaller.

02:23:07.096 --> 02:23:09.655
We both believe
in Roman fair play.

02:23:10.465 --> 02:23:11.728
You want
something from me.

02:23:11.800 --> 02:23:15.326
I would be lacking
in respect for my conscience,

02:23:15.402 --> 02:23:17.632
if I did not say that I
wish something from you.

02:23:17.705 --> 02:23:19.070
Name your price.

02:23:20.006 --> 02:23:21.838
If... Uh, no.

02:23:22.275 --> 02:23:24.902
When you win
your victory tomorrow,

02:23:25.344 --> 02:23:27.813
presumably the survivors
will be auctioned off

02:23:27.880 --> 02:23:31.576
in order to pay for the expenses
of this heroic expedition.

02:23:32.483 --> 02:23:34.884
Could not the agent
for that sale

02:23:34.952 --> 02:23:39.184
be he who shares this tiny
moment of history with Your Honor?

02:23:41.424 --> 02:23:45.258
I authorize you to be the agent
for the sale of all survivors.

02:23:45.961 --> 02:23:48.657
In return,
you will remain here

02:23:48.730 --> 02:23:51.392
until after the battle and aid
me in identifying Spartacus.

02:23:51.466 --> 02:23:52.989
After the battle?
Mm-hmm.

02:23:53.066 --> 02:23:55.660
You misunderstand me.
I'm a civilian.

02:23:55.969 --> 02:23:59.404
I'm even more of a civilian
than most civilians.

02:24:00.172 --> 02:24:01.970
If you wish to remain so,

02:24:02.041 --> 02:24:06.568
I strongly advise you to stay
here and be our guest. Guard!

02:24:09.647 --> 02:24:10.910
Hmm?

02:24:12.550 --> 02:24:17.179
My dear, all-conquering
Marcus Licinius Crassus,

02:24:18.321 --> 02:24:22.552
what if it is Spartacus who crosses
the battlefield looking for you?

02:24:24.893 --> 02:24:29.261
In such circumstances, I have
no doubt you will be helping him.

02:24:30.564 --> 02:24:33.533
This fellow remains with us
until after the battle.

02:24:33.600 --> 02:24:36.899
Make him comfortable.
Don't let him feel lonely.

02:26:10.246 --> 02:26:12.942
Mommy? Mommy?

02:26:15.617 --> 02:26:17.641
When do we go home?

02:26:22.556 --> 02:26:24.251
Go to sleep, dear.

02:26:58.052 --> 02:26:59.519
No pains yet?

02:27:00.354 --> 02:27:03.049
He's a bad child.
He hits me with his fists.

02:27:03.122 --> 02:27:06.115
He wants to see his mother.
Can you blame him?

02:27:06.459 --> 02:27:08.051
Can you feel it?

02:27:09.828 --> 02:27:11.227
No, I don't.

02:27:11.763 --> 02:27:14.288
I hope he waits
till we get to Rome.

02:27:18.169 --> 02:27:19.260
Rome.

02:27:21.404 --> 02:27:23.532
They've never
beaten us yet.

02:27:26.108 --> 02:27:27.132
No.

02:27:30.044 --> 02:27:31.671
But no matter how many times
we beat them,

02:27:31.746 --> 02:27:35.875
they still seem to have
another army to send against us.

02:27:36.950 --> 02:27:38.350
And another.

02:27:41.487 --> 02:27:44.752
Varinia, it just seems like
we've started something

02:27:46.524 --> 02:27:48.288
that has no ending.

02:27:48.359 --> 02:27:51.454
If it ended tomorrow,
it would be worth it.

02:27:57.201 --> 02:27:58.599
Oh, Varinia,

02:28:01.037 --> 02:28:02.766
don't make me weak.

02:28:03.738 --> 02:28:06.071
You're strong enough
to be weak.

02:28:06.942 --> 02:28:08.341
Oh, Varinia.

02:28:09.643 --> 02:28:11.043
Oh, Varinia,

02:28:11.579 --> 02:28:13.775
I love you
more than my life.

02:28:16.049 --> 02:28:19.576
Yet, sometimes, even with
you sleeping beside me

02:28:21.920 --> 02:28:23.513
I feel so alone.

02:28:25.656 --> 02:28:30.025
I imagine a god
for slaves and I pray.

02:28:31.828 --> 02:28:33.626
What do you
pray for?

02:28:35.699 --> 02:28:38.292
I pray for a son
who'll be born free.

02:28:40.202 --> 02:28:42.227
I pray for
the same thing.

02:28:47.508 --> 02:28:49.703
Take care of my son,
Varinia.

02:28:51.178 --> 02:28:53.111
And if he never knows me,

02:28:53.179 --> 02:28:56.478
tell him who I was
and what we dreamed of.

02:28:57.550 --> 02:29:00.416
Tell him the truth. There will
be others to tell him lies.

02:29:00.485 --> 02:29:02.647
I can't live without you,
Spartacus.

02:29:02.721 --> 02:29:05.519
Varinia,
Varinia.

02:29:07.158 --> 02:29:08.420
Varinia.

02:29:13.563 --> 02:29:18.090
Varinia, for you and me
there can be no farewells.

02:29:23.404 --> 02:29:27.203
As long as one of us lives,
we all live.

02:29:29.142 --> 02:29:31.475
I felt it.
Did you feel it?

02:29:31.845 --> 02:29:33.107
Yes, I did.

02:29:33.179 --> 02:29:35.147
That was so strong.
Does it hurt you?

02:29:35.214 --> 02:29:36.238
No.

02:29:36.315 --> 02:29:38.043
That was so strong.

02:29:40.218 --> 02:29:43.050
Oh, Varinia,
Varinia, Varinia.

02:36:00.497 --> 02:36:02.726
Lucullus and Pompey.

02:39:41.644 --> 02:39:43.668
Have we
a count of prisoners?

02:39:43.745 --> 02:39:46.339
We haven't made
the final count, sir.

02:39:46.415 --> 02:39:49.781
I bring a message
from your master,

02:39:49.850 --> 02:39:53.252
Marcus Licinius Crassus,

02:39:53.321 --> 02:39:55.151
Commander of Italy.

02:39:55.655 --> 02:39:59.524
By command of His
Most Merciful Excellency,

02:39:59.592 --> 02:40:02.151
your lives are to be spared.

02:40:05.431 --> 02:40:09.423
Slaves you were
and slaves you remain.

02:40:09.934 --> 02:40:14.803
But the terrible penalty of
crucifixion has been set aside

02:40:15.238 --> 02:40:19.641
on the single condition
that you identify the body

02:40:19.709 --> 02:40:24.168
or the living person
of the slave called Spartacus.

02:40:36.889 --> 02:40:39.551
I'm Spartacus!

02:40:41.293 --> 02:40:42.920
I'm Spartacus.

02:40:43.128 --> 02:40:45.995
I'm Spartacus!

02:40:46.063 --> 02:40:47.531
I'm Spartacus!
I'm Spartacus!

02:40:47.598 --> 02:40:52.162
I'm Spartacus!

02:40:58.507 --> 02:41:00.600
I'm Spartacus.

02:41:02.376 --> 02:41:03.935
I'm Spartacus.

02:41:24.461 --> 02:41:27.954
Forgive me for being one of
the last to congratulate you.

02:41:28.031 --> 02:41:30.522
There's an ugly rumor
going round the camp

02:41:30.600 --> 02:41:33.535
that the prisoners
are to be crucified.

02:41:34.936 --> 02:41:36.404
That is true.

02:41:37.239 --> 02:41:39.639
Perhaps this is the moment
to remind Your Highness

02:41:39.708 --> 02:41:43.166
that you promised me I could be
the agent in their auctioning.

02:41:43.244 --> 02:41:46.679
You promised Spartacus to me!
Where is he?

02:41:47.180 --> 02:41:50.844
In return, I promised you the sale of
the survivors and there will be none!

02:42:15.703 --> 02:42:17.330
But
it's Varinia.

02:42:17.405 --> 02:42:20.465
Yes, I remember.
You're the woman of Spartacus?

02:42:21.275 --> 02:42:22.742
I'm his wife.

02:42:23.644 --> 02:42:25.509
And this is
his child?

02:42:27.413 --> 02:42:28.471
Yes.

02:42:29.582 --> 02:42:31.310
Where is Spartacus?

02:42:35.587 --> 02:42:36.678
Dead.

02:42:38.122 --> 02:42:40.056
Did you
see him killed?

02:42:44.160 --> 02:42:45.389
Yes.

02:42:47.196 --> 02:42:48.663
You're lying.

02:42:49.865 --> 02:42:51.298
Where is he?

02:42:55.770 --> 02:42:58.205
At least here is someone
worth selling, Your Enormity.

02:42:58.272 --> 02:43:01.104
I'll even take the child
as an investment.

02:43:02.242 --> 02:43:03.471
How many women
have been taken?

02:43:03.577 --> 02:43:04.770
Under 40, sir.

02:43:04.844 --> 02:43:07.938
Those who weren't killed have run
off to the hills with their children.

02:43:08.013 --> 02:43:10.208
You may sell all the others
but not this woman.

02:43:10.281 --> 02:43:13.979
You haven't seen the others.
They're of surpassing ugliness!

02:43:14.052 --> 02:43:15.575
A genius wouldn't be able
to sell them.

02:43:15.652 --> 02:43:17.985
Flog that scoundrel
out of camp.

02:43:18.589 --> 02:43:22.183
This woman and her child are to
be conveyed to my house in Rome.

02:43:36.103 --> 02:43:38.002
Halt them!
Halt!

02:43:43.075 --> 02:43:44.668
Antoninus?

02:44:02.625 --> 02:44:03.853
Tribune!

02:44:09.597 --> 02:44:12.896
Slaves are to be crucified
along the roadside

02:44:13.033 --> 02:44:16.798
the full distance between
here and the gates of Rome.

02:44:21.173 --> 02:44:23.266
Hold this man
till the end.

02:44:26.745 --> 02:44:28.405
And that man, too.

02:44:35.184 --> 02:44:37.050
March on.
March on!

02:45:31.130 --> 02:45:33.793
I've more stripes
than a zebra.

02:45:34.032 --> 02:45:39.130
Every time I touch my wounds,
they sing like larks.

02:45:40.538 --> 02:45:44.770
But in spite of that, I found something
I never had before, with all my wealth.

02:45:44.842 --> 02:45:46.104
What is that?

02:45:46.876 --> 02:45:50.074
Don't laugh at me, but I
believe it to be dignity.

02:45:50.347 --> 02:45:54.578
In Rome, dignity shortens life
even more surely than disease.

02:45:54.917 --> 02:45:58.147
The gods must be saving you
for some great enterprise.

02:45:58.219 --> 02:45:59.687
You think so?

02:46:00.121 --> 02:46:03.920
Anyone who believes I'll turn
informer for nothing is a fool.

02:46:04.658 --> 02:46:07.218
I bore the whip
without complaint.

02:46:07.294 --> 02:46:10.820
Indeed, that sounds like
a bad attack of dignity.

02:46:11.297 --> 02:46:13.856
I hope this
will not deflect you

02:46:13.932 --> 02:46:16.162
from the revenge you were
going to take on Crassus.

02:46:16.234 --> 02:46:18.793
On the contrary, it only
strengthens my resolve.

02:46:18.869 --> 02:46:21.566
That's enough.
I'm glad to learn that.

02:46:23.807 --> 02:46:27.607
This woman, Varinia, is in his
house. All Rome knows about it.

02:46:27.677 --> 02:46:32.307
Malicious tongues even say that
he's in love for the first time.

02:46:33.115 --> 02:46:35.083
Yes! Oh.

02:46:36.350 --> 02:46:40.014
I noticed a strange look in
his eye when he first saw her.

02:46:40.221 --> 02:46:45.124
It would take a great woman to make
Crassus fall out of love with himself.

02:46:45.725 --> 02:46:47.283
I'll be honest with you.

02:46:47.359 --> 02:46:50.818
She's not as unattractive
as I told you she was.

02:46:50.896 --> 02:46:54.263
Dignity and honesty in one
afternoon. I hardly recognize you.

02:46:55.433 --> 02:46:57.128
But she is
an impossible woman.

02:46:57.201 --> 02:46:58.224
Beautiful?

02:46:58.301 --> 02:47:00.395
Beautiful?
Well, beautiful.

02:47:00.704 --> 02:47:03.502
The more chains you put on her,
the less like a slave she looks.

02:47:03.572 --> 02:47:05.598
Proud?
Proud, proud.

02:47:05.674 --> 02:47:10.577
You feel that she would surrender
to the right man which is irritating.

02:47:11.579 --> 02:47:13.809
I like Crassus.

02:47:13.882 --> 02:47:17.874
Let's save him from his agony.
Let's steal this woman.

02:47:18.986 --> 02:47:21.386
Steal the woman? Why?

02:47:21.454 --> 02:47:23.855
I can no longer hurt Crassus
in the Senate

02:47:23.923 --> 02:47:27.654
but I can hurt him where he'll
feel it most, in his pride.

02:47:27.726 --> 02:47:29.888
Attack our enemy
from within.

02:47:29.961 --> 02:47:32.691
The scheme is excellent, but
I hope you're not suggesting

02:47:32.763 --> 02:47:34.925
that I steal the woman.

02:47:34.999 --> 02:47:36.591
Yes!

02:47:37.367 --> 02:47:40.530
Buy some horses
and a cart with a canopy.

02:47:40.603 --> 02:47:42.730
Bring her here by nightfall.

02:47:42.971 --> 02:47:44.268
Oh, no.

02:47:44.540 --> 02:47:48.168
Add courage
to your newfound virtues.

02:47:50.378 --> 02:47:54.143
Would half a million sesterces
make you brave?

02:47:56.450 --> 02:47:57.974
Half a million?

02:48:01.320 --> 02:48:03.755
Well, Crassus

02:48:03.823 --> 02:48:07.349
does seem to dwindle
in the mind, but...

02:48:07.659 --> 02:48:10.957
Let's reduce him further.
A round million!

02:48:11.662 --> 02:48:12.993
A million.

02:48:13.864 --> 02:48:16.855
For such a sum,
I could bribe Jupiter himself!

02:48:17.300 --> 02:48:19.462
With a lesser sum,
I have.

02:48:26.074 --> 02:48:30.340
Forgive the intrusion. I'm not
in the habit of coming uninvited.

02:48:30.411 --> 02:48:32.378
You've always been
welcome here.

02:48:32.445 --> 02:48:33.435
As a pupil.

02:48:38.650 --> 02:48:40.050
You're not alone.

02:48:40.619 --> 02:48:42.053
No.

02:48:43.055 --> 02:48:45.352
This time
you've come to teach.

02:48:47.692 --> 02:48:49.557
You've joined Crassus?

02:48:50.694 --> 02:48:52.685
Am I arrested?
No.

02:48:53.063 --> 02:48:56.862
But I must ask you to come with
me to the Senate immediately.

02:48:58.100 --> 02:49:02.502
What I do, I do not
for myself but for Rome.

02:49:02.570 --> 02:49:05.835
Rome? Poor,
helpless Rome.

02:49:06.740 --> 02:49:10.734
Let's go and hear more
about Rome from Crassus.

02:49:15.982 --> 02:49:18.416
Did you truly believe
500 years of Rome

02:49:18.483 --> 02:49:22.010
could so easily be delivered
into the clutches of a mob?

02:49:25.589 --> 02:49:29.650
Already the bodies of 6,000
crucified slaves

02:49:29.726 --> 02:49:31.489
line the Appian Way.

02:49:32.128 --> 02:49:35.097
Tomorrow the last of their
companions will fight to the death

02:49:35.164 --> 02:49:38.657
in the temple of my fathers,
as a sacrifice to them.

02:49:39.200 --> 02:49:42.932
As those slaves have died,
so will your rabble

02:49:43.004 --> 02:49:47.907
if they falter one instant
in loyalty to the new order.

02:49:48.675 --> 02:49:50.938
The enemies of the state
are known.

02:49:51.377 --> 02:49:55.143
Arrests are in progress.
The prisons begin to fill.

02:49:55.580 --> 02:49:59.346
In every city and province, lists
of the disloyal have been compiled.

02:50:00.151 --> 02:50:04.713
Tomorrow they will learn the
cost of their terrible folly,

02:50:06.390 --> 02:50:07.879
their treason.

02:50:08.891 --> 02:50:13.293
Where does my name appear on the
list of disloyal enemies of the state?

02:50:14.429 --> 02:50:15.590
First.

02:50:17.965 --> 02:50:21.367
Yet, upon you I have
no desire for vengeance.

02:50:22.436 --> 02:50:24.927
Your property
shall not be touched.

02:50:25.071 --> 02:50:28.371
You will retain the rank
and title of Roman senator.

02:50:28.708 --> 02:50:29.902
A house...

02:50:30.876 --> 02:50:34.402
A farmhouse in Picenum has
been provided for your exile.

02:50:35.146 --> 02:50:37.547
You may take your women
with you.

02:50:38.916 --> 02:50:43.114
Why am I to be left
so conspicuously alive?

02:50:43.887 --> 02:50:46.946
Your followers are deluded
enough to trust you.

02:50:47.022 --> 02:50:50.788
I intend that you shall speak to them
tomorrow for the sake of their own good,

02:50:50.860 --> 02:50:53.851
their peaceful
and profitable future.

02:50:54.429 --> 02:50:57.955
From time to time thereafter, I may
find it useful to bring you back to Rome

02:50:58.031 --> 02:51:00.091
to continue your duty to her,

02:51:00.167 --> 02:51:04.535
to calm the envious spirit
and the troubled mind.

02:51:05.204 --> 02:51:10.141
You will persuade them
to accept destiny and order,

02:51:10.542 --> 02:51:12.806
and trust the gods!

02:51:16.914 --> 02:51:18.279
You may go.

02:51:29.758 --> 02:51:31.191
Halt!

02:52:17.497 --> 02:52:19.829
Why hide behind
that stola, hmm?

02:52:25.670 --> 02:52:27.160
That's better.

02:52:27.738 --> 02:52:30.674
That dress took some weeks
of a woman's life.

02:52:31.274 --> 02:52:35.734
You, above all people, should respect
the work of slaves and wear it proudly.

02:52:35.812 --> 02:52:37.142
Come here.

02:52:52.092 --> 02:52:56.528
This belonged to a queen,
the Queen of Persia.

02:52:58.197 --> 02:52:59.561
It's heavy.

02:53:01.866 --> 02:53:04.596
In time you will
wear it lightly enough.

02:53:17.713 --> 02:53:18.975
Sit down.

02:53:22.616 --> 02:53:25.779
Will you have
some squab and honey?

02:53:27.287 --> 02:53:28.447
No.

02:53:29.055 --> 02:53:30.421
You'll enjoy it.

02:53:32.192 --> 02:53:33.988
And a piece
of melon?

02:53:38.629 --> 02:53:40.621
And some wine,
of course.

02:53:42.600 --> 02:53:43.691
Eat.

02:53:49.772 --> 02:53:53.367
I did not command you
to eat, I invited you.

02:53:55.577 --> 02:53:59.980
You find the richness of your
surroundings makes conversation difficult?

02:54:02.916 --> 02:54:04.407
Why am I
here?

02:54:08.354 --> 02:54:09.845
Good question.

02:54:10.857 --> 02:54:12.585
A woman's question.

02:54:13.792 --> 02:54:17.250
I wish the answer could be
as good and straightforward.

02:54:20.164 --> 02:54:22.962
The infant,
it thrives?

02:54:24.134 --> 02:54:25.260
He thrives.

02:54:25.335 --> 02:54:29.930
I purchased a wet nurse for him,
yesterday. I hope the milk agrees with him.

02:54:32.608 --> 02:54:34.200
I sent her away.

02:54:35.042 --> 02:54:37.534
I prefer to nurse
the child myself.

02:54:38.613 --> 02:54:40.512
I'm not sure
I approve.

02:54:42.182 --> 02:54:44.310
It ties you
to the old life.

02:54:45.351 --> 02:54:48.411
I want you to begin to
look forward to the new.

02:54:51.189 --> 02:54:53.715
I don't care
about my new life here.

02:54:54.559 --> 02:54:57.721
You care about the life
of your child, don't you?

02:54:58.729 --> 02:55:01.255
Why do you threaten me
with my baby?

02:55:01.864 --> 02:55:04.834
I belong to you. You can
take me anytime you wish.

02:55:04.901 --> 02:55:07.562
But I don't want
to take you.

02:55:08.804 --> 02:55:10.533
I want you to give.

02:55:13.407 --> 02:55:15.432
I want your love,
Varinia.

02:55:19.012 --> 02:55:23.108
You think by threatening to kill
my child you'll make me love you?

02:55:23.416 --> 02:55:26.476
I did not threaten
to kill your child.

02:55:33.724 --> 02:55:36.693
I'm sorry, Varinia.

02:55:43.299 --> 02:55:45.495
One shouldn't grieve
forever.

02:55:46.701 --> 02:55:49.728
I'm not grieving,
I'm remembering.

02:55:50.738 --> 02:55:53.172
Do I interfere
with your memories?

02:55:54.541 --> 02:55:55.736
Oh, no.

02:55:58.644 --> 02:56:03.411
You tread the ridge between truth and
insult with the skill of a mountain goat.

02:56:03.815 --> 02:56:04.907
Well.

02:56:07.285 --> 02:56:10.652
What do you remember, when
you think about Spartacus?

02:56:13.123 --> 02:56:15.148
It doesn't distress you
to talk about him?

02:56:15.658 --> 02:56:16.682
No.

02:56:18.461 --> 02:56:19.826
Well, then,

02:56:21.964 --> 02:56:26.263
what sort of a man
was he, really?

02:56:31.471 --> 02:56:35.635
He was a man who began
all alone, like an animal.

02:56:37.109 --> 02:56:38.600
Yet on the day he died,

02:56:38.677 --> 02:56:42.408
thousands and thousands would
gladly have died in his place.

02:56:44.215 --> 02:56:46.878
What was he?
Was he a god?

02:56:48.418 --> 02:56:50.011
He wasn't a god.

02:56:51.221 --> 02:56:54.781
He was a simple man.
A slave.

02:56:58.894 --> 02:57:00.293
I loved him.

02:57:00.996 --> 02:57:03.465
He was an outlaw!
A murderer!

02:57:03.532 --> 02:57:07.262
An enemy to everything fine
and decent that Rome ever built!

02:57:08.202 --> 02:57:10.067
Damn you!
You tell me.

02:57:10.970 --> 02:57:12.199
Why did you love him?

02:57:12.805 --> 02:57:14.239
I can't tell you.

02:57:14.374 --> 02:57:17.536
I can't tell you things
you can never understand.

02:57:18.911 --> 02:57:21.470
But I want to understand.

02:57:22.413 --> 02:57:26.212
Don't you see?
I must understand.

02:57:35.057 --> 02:57:37.457
You're afraid of him,
aren't you?

02:57:41.829 --> 02:57:43.956
That's why
you want his wife,

02:57:44.631 --> 02:57:47.658
to soothe your fear
by having something he had.

02:57:50.002 --> 02:57:53.632
When you're so afraid,
nothing can help.

02:57:54.472 --> 02:57:55.701
Nothing.

02:58:04.515 --> 02:58:05.982
We shall see.

02:58:30.736 --> 02:58:32.931
Could we have won,
Spartacus?

02:58:35.240 --> 02:58:37.140
Could we ever
have won?

02:58:41.778 --> 02:58:44.508
Just by fighting them,
we won something.

02:58:47.984 --> 02:58:50.611
When just one man says
"No, I won't,"

02:58:51.353 --> 02:58:53.116
Rome begins to fear.

02:58:58.559 --> 02:59:01.186
We were tens of thousands
who said no.

02:59:02.295 --> 02:59:04.320
That was
the wonder of it.

02:59:05.164 --> 02:59:08.429
To have seen slaves lift
their heads from the dust,

02:59:11.136 --> 02:59:15.800
to see them rise from
their knees, stand tall

02:59:18.608 --> 02:59:20.599
with a song on their lips,

02:59:22.445 --> 02:59:23.844
to hear them

02:59:25.414 --> 02:59:28.781
storm through
the mountains shouting,

02:59:31.419 --> 02:59:33.910
to hear them sing
along the plains.

02:59:37.658 --> 02:59:39.454
And now they're dead.

02:59:42.428 --> 02:59:43.520
Dead.

02:59:50.468 --> 02:59:51.662
Varinia

02:59:55.539 --> 02:59:56.630
dead.

03:00:00.977 --> 03:00:02.444
And the baby.

03:00:16.056 --> 03:00:17.455
All of them.

03:00:28.666 --> 03:00:30.793
Are you afraid to die,
Spartacus?

03:00:31.735 --> 03:00:33.032
Hmm.

03:00:34.237 --> 03:00:36.535
No more than
I was to be born.

03:00:47.848 --> 03:00:49.373
Are you afraid?

03:00:52.985 --> 03:00:54.044
Yes.

03:01:07.231 --> 03:01:08.630
Hail Consul!

03:01:09.332 --> 03:01:10.925
Guard, fall in.

03:01:12.001 --> 03:01:13.264
Where are
the gladiators?

03:01:13.336 --> 03:01:14.894
Over there,
sir.

03:01:39.324 --> 03:01:43.089
Antoninus, the night passes
slowly, doesn't it?

03:01:54.703 --> 03:01:56.034
Spartacus.

03:02:01.909 --> 03:02:06.038
You are he,
aren't you?

03:02:09.515 --> 03:02:13.281
Gladiator,
I'm Marcus Licinius Crassus.

03:02:16.888 --> 03:02:21.051
You must answer
when I speak to you.

03:02:44.610 --> 03:02:45.942
Centurion!

03:02:49.014 --> 03:02:52.712
Let them fight now.
Unchain them.

03:02:52.918 --> 03:02:57.217
The entire city's been told they'll fight
tomorrow in the temple of your ancestors.

03:02:57.288 --> 03:03:00.279
They will fight now
for me. Here!

03:03:00.824 --> 03:03:04.225
And to the death. And the
victor shall be crucified.

03:03:05.194 --> 03:03:08.129
We will test this myth
of slave brotherhood.

03:03:08.630 --> 03:03:10.098
Unchain them!

03:03:18.071 --> 03:03:19.562
Form a circle.

03:03:36.453 --> 03:03:38.580
Don't give them the
pleasure of a contest.

03:03:38.654 --> 03:03:40.452
I'll kill you
on the first rush.

03:03:40.523 --> 03:03:41.513
I won't let them
crucify you.

03:03:41.624 --> 03:03:43.922
It's my last order.
Obey it.

03:03:43.993 --> 03:03:45.517
Let them begin.

03:04:22.358 --> 03:04:24.553
I won't let them
crucify you.

03:04:35.468 --> 03:04:38.130
Do you realize how long
it takes to die on a cross?

03:04:38.204 --> 03:04:39.501
I don't care!

03:04:56.652 --> 03:04:58.518
Forgive me,
Antoninus.

03:05:08.995 --> 03:05:13.261
I love you, Spartacus,
as I loved my own father.

03:05:13.933 --> 03:05:18.302
I love you like my son
that I'll never see.

03:05:22.974 --> 03:05:24.372
Go to sleep.

03:05:59.070 --> 03:06:00.833
Here's your victory.

03:06:03.173 --> 03:06:04.766
He'll come back.

03:06:05.408 --> 03:06:08.105
He'll come back
and he'll be millions!

03:06:12.715 --> 03:06:15.148
I wonder what
Spartacus would say

03:06:16.050 --> 03:06:19.452
if he knew that the woman,
Varinia, and her child

03:06:20.387 --> 03:06:22.685
are slaves
in my household?

03:06:35.800 --> 03:06:36.857
Yes.

03:06:40.137 --> 03:06:41.468
Spartacus.

03:06:46.175 --> 03:06:47.575
Crucify him!

03:07:06.325 --> 03:07:08.817
I want no grave for him.
No marker.

03:07:09.028 --> 03:07:12.656
His body's to be burned and
his ashes scattered in secret.

03:07:22.204 --> 03:07:24.230
Did you fear him,
Crassus?

03:07:24.774 --> 03:07:28.004
Not when I fought him.
I knew he could be beaten.

03:07:29.110 --> 03:07:32.841
But now I fear him,
even more than I fear you.

03:07:32.913 --> 03:07:33.937
Me?

03:07:34.014 --> 03:07:36.608
Yes, my dear Caesar.
You!

03:07:38.851 --> 03:07:42.378
I don't see the letter here
to the leader of the Senate.

03:07:42.689 --> 03:07:46.146
Oh, yes. Julia, I don't like
the sound of weeping.

03:07:46.224 --> 03:07:48.716
This is a happy house.
Please stop.

03:07:50.227 --> 03:07:53.356
Oh, there you are. Go away,
Julia! Where have you been?

03:07:53.431 --> 03:07:55.899
The city is full of Crassus'
legions. We've been hiding.

03:07:55.965 --> 03:07:58.457
I don't know Rome
as well as I know Capua.

03:07:58.535 --> 03:08:00.627
They're arresting
everyone.

03:08:10.445 --> 03:08:14.642
So this is the woman it took Crassus
eight Roman legions to conquer.

03:08:14.714 --> 03:08:18.013
I wish I had time to make
your acquaintance, my dear.

03:08:18.084 --> 03:08:23.020
Unfortunately, we all have to make
journeys to different destinations.

03:08:23.488 --> 03:08:25.251
Where are we going?

03:08:26.057 --> 03:08:29.049
You're going to Aquitania. The
governor's one of my innumerable cousins.

03:08:29.126 --> 03:08:32.528
Here's a senatorial pass. It's
valid in all the known world.

03:08:32.596 --> 03:08:34.563
Why do I have
to go to Aquitania?

03:08:34.630 --> 03:08:35.620
'Cause I asked you to.

03:08:36.833 --> 03:08:39.323
It's very good of you,
Gracchus, but I...

03:08:39.401 --> 03:08:43.269
Double the money I promised you.
Here's two million sesterces.

03:08:43.338 --> 03:08:44.771
Two million?

03:08:45.673 --> 03:08:49.336
Here. Articles of freedom
for the woman.

03:08:49.677 --> 03:08:53.942
And here's a smaller document
that I've prepared for the child,

03:08:54.013 --> 03:08:55.742
befitting its size.

03:09:01.986 --> 03:09:03.351
Where are you going?

03:09:03.421 --> 03:09:04.479
Hmm?

03:09:05.690 --> 03:09:07.452
Oh, to Picenum.

03:09:07.791 --> 03:09:10.260
Picenum? That's the
dreariest town in Italy.

03:09:10.327 --> 03:09:12.317
Will you please leave me?

03:09:14.230 --> 03:09:18.325
Come with us. See to it that
I don't misuse the money.

03:09:18.433 --> 03:09:20.765
Don't be ridiculous.
I'm a senator.

03:09:20.835 --> 03:09:23.997
Will you please go
before the soldiers come here?

03:09:29.375 --> 03:09:30.570
Oh!

03:09:31.377 --> 03:09:34.437
This would really
make Crassus jealous.

03:09:36.481 --> 03:09:38.472
Go and make my joy
complete.

03:09:38.550 --> 03:09:41.610
Save your tears now.
Save them for the journey.

03:09:50.493 --> 03:09:53.155
Well. Prettier.

03:10:13.078 --> 03:10:14.204
Halt!

03:10:19.750 --> 03:10:21.775
Identify yourselves,
please.

03:10:21.852 --> 03:10:24.218
Lentulus Batiatus.

03:10:24.288 --> 03:10:26.687
Climb down, please,
and identify yourselves.

03:10:26.756 --> 03:10:28.451
I object
to that tone.

03:10:28.524 --> 03:10:29.787
I've got
my orders.

03:10:29.859 --> 03:10:32.691
Come down and
identify yourselves, please.

03:10:40.201 --> 03:10:43.863
As I told you, I'm Lentulus
Batiatus, the lanista from Capua.

03:10:43.937 --> 03:10:47.338
This...
My sister-in-law.

03:10:51.009 --> 03:10:52.840
Lady, please.

03:10:53.945 --> 03:10:58.404
She's traveling with
her child to Aquitania

03:10:58.481 --> 03:11:00.814
on a senatorial pass.

03:11:00.884 --> 03:11:02.408
Take a look through his baggage.

03:11:02.485 --> 03:11:04.180
Not a word,
please.

03:11:10.925 --> 03:11:12.552
What did you say?

03:11:22.868 --> 03:11:24.734
Oh, Spartacus.

03:11:55.228 --> 03:11:57.197
Tell the lady
no loitering's allowed.

03:11:57.264 --> 03:11:58.253
Instantly.

03:11:58.365 --> 03:11:59.854
Move on.
Yes.

03:12:04.370 --> 03:12:05.996
This is your son.

03:12:08.406 --> 03:12:11.773
He's free, Spartacus!
Free!

03:12:15.078 --> 03:12:16.443
He's free.

03:12:18.114 --> 03:12:19.843
He's free.

03:12:22.717 --> 03:12:26.813
He'll remember you, Spartacus,
because I'll tell him.

03:12:28.622 --> 03:12:32.149
I'll tell him who his father
was and what he dreamed of.

03:12:35.295 --> 03:12:38.593
Varinia, have mercy on us.
Get in the wagon.

03:12:40.032 --> 03:12:41.829
Oh, my love,
my life.

03:12:44.669 --> 03:12:46.864
Please die, die.

03:12:47.471 --> 03:12:50.099
Please, please die,
my love.

03:12:50.874 --> 03:12:52.933
Oh, God,
why can't you die!

03:12:53.009 --> 03:12:54.999
Come on. Come on.

03:13:11.091 --> 03:13:13.582
Goodbye, my love,
my life.

03:13:14.093 --> 03:13:15.925
Goodbye, goodbye.
