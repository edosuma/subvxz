00:02.420 --> 00:03.420
Previously on "How to Get Away
with Murder"...

00:03.420 --> 00:04.500
Sam Keating
went missing that night.

00:04.500 --> 00:05.580
His remains were found
a few weeks later.

00:05.580 --> 00:06.920
Did you all do that?

00:06.920 --> 00:08.120
Do you really
want to know?

00:08.120 --> 00:10.000
I'm denying Ms. Keating's
request for bail

00:10.000 --> 00:11.920
and ordering
that she be remanded

00:11.920 --> 00:13.420
to Philadelphia County Prison.

00:13.420 --> 00:15.000
Dr. Bradfield

00:15.000 --> 00:17.040
of the Philadelphia
Medical Examiner's Office

00:17.040 --> 00:20.330
has confirmed
that Mr. Gibbins' cause of death

00:20.330 --> 00:23.330
is asphyxiation
due to smoke inhalation.

00:23.330 --> 00:24.880
You said he died
before the fire.

00:24.880 --> 00:27.460
Before I did
the official autopsy.

00:27.460 --> 00:29.580
Our initial theories change
all the time.

00:29.580 --> 00:32.500
I saw someone there.
Was it you?

00:32.500 --> 00:33.710
No.

00:33.710 --> 00:35.290
It should have been you.

00:35.290 --> 00:37.080
We were told you wanted
to make a statement?

00:37.080 --> 00:38.500
About the murder
of Wes Gibbins.

00:38.500 --> 00:39.460
What about it?

00:40.460 --> 00:41.620
I did it.

01:01.580 --> 01:04.500
How'd you know
where to find me?

01:04.500 --> 01:06.420
I've got contacts
at the station.

01:06.420 --> 01:07.620
You know that.

01:09.960 --> 01:11.290
What'd they want?

01:13.040 --> 01:14.830
They're investigating
Annalise.

01:16.750 --> 01:19.210
You tell them anything?

01:19.210 --> 01:20.210
No.

01:21.830 --> 01:25.120
But I might.

01:25.120 --> 01:27.380
About...?

01:27.380 --> 01:29.420
That you killed
my father.

01:32.040 --> 01:34.170
You think
Laurel would approve?

01:34.170 --> 01:35.830
Why wouldn't she?

01:35.830 --> 01:37.290
You'd be hurting me.

01:39.380 --> 01:41.790
Maybe
that's what she wants.

01:41.790 --> 01:44.670
You don't know her.

01:44.670 --> 01:46.210
Not like me.

01:46.210 --> 01:47.920
I know that she deserves
better than you.

01:47.920 --> 01:50.420
And you think that's you?

01:50.420 --> 01:53.250
I'd never hurt her
the way you have.

01:53.250 --> 01:54.880
Or Annalise.

01:57.120 --> 01:58.460
You don't know Annalise.

01:58.460 --> 02:00.420
You killed her son.

02:02.380 --> 02:04.290
She told me.

02:05.790 --> 02:07.790
And now
you're dead to her.

02:09.880 --> 02:12.040
You know that. Otherwise,
you'd have hurt me by now.

02:12.040 --> 02:13.710
But you're not gonna.

02:13.710 --> 02:18.750
Because you know she would
never forgive you for it.

02:20.080 --> 02:23.000
That's how much more
I mean to her than you.

02:23.000 --> 02:26.000
I picked him up in my car,

02:26.000 --> 02:28.830
told him
Annalise wanted to see him.

02:28.830 --> 02:29.960
He was nervous --
I could tell.

02:29.960 --> 02:33.080
But then he got in.

02:33.080 --> 02:35.670
I took him to the house.

02:35.670 --> 02:38.080
When he saw she wasn't there,
he got scared, tried to leave,

02:38.080 --> 02:39.330
so I knocked him out.

02:41.540 --> 02:42.710
Chloroform.

02:44.210 --> 02:46.500
Keating. On your feet.

02:46.500 --> 02:47.790
I said, "On your feet"!

02:49.580 --> 02:51.380
Where are you taking her?

02:51.380 --> 02:52.710
Turn around.

02:55.330 --> 02:56.960
Where you taking
Fresh Fish?

02:56.960 --> 02:59.120
I ain't even
got a taste yet.

02:59.120 --> 03:01.540
Dang, mama,
I was gonna make you my boo.

03:01.540 --> 03:04.830
Cut the gas line and left
the burner going on the stove.

03:04.830 --> 03:07.920
Gave me time to get out
before it all went up.

03:11.170 --> 03:12.670
Watch your head.

03:18.120 --> 03:19.790
Where are we going?

03:20.960 --> 03:22.250
Why?

03:23.960 --> 03:25.210
What?

03:25.210 --> 03:26.880
Let's say
we do believe you.

03:26.880 --> 03:28.250
Why kill him?

03:32.670 --> 03:33.880
Laurel.

03:46.380 --> 03:49.250
She left me for him.

03:49.250 --> 03:52.040
I tried to be okay
with it, but...

03:52.040 --> 03:54.580
I lost it when I found out
she was pregnant.

03:57.750 --> 03:58.790
On the gate!

04:01.790 --> 04:03.170
Where's my lawyer?

04:03.170 --> 04:04.620
Quiet.

04:04.620 --> 04:06.670
You're violating my Sixth
Amendment right to counsel.

04:06.670 --> 04:07.710
She's all yours.

04:10.080 --> 04:11.710
I demand to see my lawyer.

04:11.710 --> 04:12.620
You wanted Laurel dead, too?

04:12.620 --> 04:14.040
No.

04:14.040 --> 04:15.210
She was in the house
when it exploded --

04:15.210 --> 04:16.790
She wasn't supposed to be.

04:19.040 --> 04:22.040
That's why I'm here.

04:22.040 --> 04:23.380
I can't take
that I hurt her.

04:35.670 --> 04:38.040
I don't talk
till I see Bonnie.

04:38.040 --> 04:39.540
She didn't
answer her phone.
It's the middle
of the night.

04:39.540 --> 04:40.920
And this is urgent.

04:42.880 --> 04:44.790
Let's talk
about Frank Delfino.

04:57.120 --> 04:58.880
You were Delfino's lawyer,
right?

04:58.880 --> 05:00.170
When he was charged
with attempting

05:00.170 --> 05:03.080
to murder his father --
got him out on parole.

05:03.080 --> 05:08.290
After that, you gave him a job,
brought him into your home.

05:08.290 --> 05:10.540
A little unorthodox.

05:10.540 --> 05:13.040
Was he working
as an investigator for you?

05:15.120 --> 05:16.750
I killed him.

05:19.540 --> 05:21.500
Frank...

05:21.500 --> 05:23.380
JFK...

05:23.380 --> 05:24.670
and Elvis.

05:26.670 --> 05:28.960
What else
do you want to know?

05:28.960 --> 05:32.380
All of it is inadmissible
until you get me my lawyer.

05:51.250 --> 05:52.750
Ms. Winterbottom,

05:52.750 --> 05:55.790
this is Officer Taylor
from the Philadelphia PD.

05:59.250 --> 06:01.460
Get up.
You're free to go.

06:01.460 --> 06:02.960
No.

06:02.960 --> 06:04.620
Your confession
can't be corroborated.

06:04.620 --> 06:06.250
So either we arrest you

06:06.250 --> 06:08.330
for obstruction of justice
and perjury

06:08.330 --> 06:10.460
or you get to go home --
we forget this ever happened.

06:12.250 --> 06:14.710
You got street cameras
outside the station, right?

06:39.210 --> 06:40.830
Ma'am, you can't
just walk back there!

06:40.830 --> 06:42.170
I'm Ms. Keating's lawyer.

06:42.170 --> 06:43.580
Ma'am!

06:43.580 --> 06:45.290
You're gonna arrest me
but not charge me?

06:45.290 --> 06:46.670
We can question you
for 48 hours

06:46.670 --> 06:47.830
before we have to
charge you.

06:47.830 --> 06:49.290
You got a lawyer
you want us to call?

06:49.290 --> 06:51.330
Nah. I'm done hiding.

06:51.330 --> 06:52.460
Frank!

06:57.420 --> 06:58.880
No.
Get him out of here.

06:58.880 --> 07:00.210
I killed Wes.

07:00.210 --> 07:01.710
Tell Annalise I'm sorry!

07:01.710 --> 07:03.540
Please!
Tell her I'm sorry!

07:07.620 --> 07:09.040
Obviously,
this is a difficult time.

07:09.040 --> 07:11.540
I urge you to use the resources
we have available --

07:11.540 --> 07:13.710
talking to counselors,
taking time off,

07:13.710 --> 07:15.250
whatever you need.

07:15.250 --> 07:17.960
The Office of the President
will support you.

07:17.960 --> 07:20.880
Thanks.
That means a lot.

07:20.880 --> 07:24.460
Obviously, we have
some outside attention

07:24.460 --> 07:27.250
because of
Professor Keating's arrest --

07:27.250 --> 07:28.500
police, journalists.

07:28.500 --> 07:30.500
So please know
we are a resource

07:30.500 --> 07:31.880
if you need
any guidance.

07:31.880 --> 07:35.170
He's a lawyer, right?

07:35.170 --> 07:38.960
Um, Mike Richardson,
a trustee for the university.

07:38.960 --> 07:42.120
With all due respect, the whole
"We're here for you" spiel

07:42.120 --> 07:43.750
loses its intended effect

07:43.750 --> 07:45.460
when you have legal counsel
taking notes.

07:45.460 --> 07:48.250
It's university policy
to have adequate record

07:48.250 --> 07:49.920
in situations
like these.

07:49.920 --> 07:51.880
You mean situations where you
need to protect the endowment.

07:51.880 --> 07:53.620
I can assure you

07:53.620 --> 07:55.620
my presence is simply about
safeguarding your welfare.

07:55.620 --> 07:57.710
No, you're afraid
we're going to sue --

07:57.710 --> 07:59.460
you know, for negligence
and punitive damages

07:59.460 --> 08:01.830
for not providing adequate
security to your students.

08:01.830 --> 08:04.580
We simply wanted to check
how you're doing.

08:04.580 --> 08:06.420
Wes was
a close friend of yours.

08:06.420 --> 08:08.000
Not that close, really.

08:09.460 --> 08:11.710
Regardless,
we've all lost

08:11.710 --> 08:13.620
a member
of this campus's family.

08:13.620 --> 08:16.880
Did you ever even meet Wes?

08:16.880 --> 08:18.960
No, but --

08:18.960 --> 08:21.420
Have you scheduled a memorial
for him yet?

08:23.000 --> 08:24.580
Of course not.

08:24.580 --> 08:26.040
Because your immediate goal

08:26.040 --> 08:28.120
is to distance this university
from Professor Keating.

08:28.120 --> 08:29.420
Michaela,
we should just --

08:29.420 --> 08:31.830
Let me remind you
that the most basic legal tenet

08:31.830 --> 08:34.620
is innocence
until proven guilty.

08:34.620 --> 08:35.710
That applies
to Professor Keating,

08:35.710 --> 08:37.290
who -- let's be clear --
is being framed

08:37.290 --> 08:38.670
for a crime
she didn't commit.

08:38.670 --> 08:40.420
Yet this office still
hasn't released a statement

08:40.420 --> 08:42.000
of support for her,
which I understand

08:42.000 --> 08:44.080
from a covering-your-ass
point of view,

08:44.080 --> 08:46.250
but not from
a looking-to-the-future one.

08:46.250 --> 08:49.000
Professor Keating
is Middleton Law.

08:49.000 --> 08:50.670
She is a brilliant, empowering
force of legal nature,

08:50.670 --> 08:52.080
and you should think
long and hard

08:52.080 --> 08:54.000
before you hang her out
to dry.

09:04.080 --> 09:06.750
They're talking to Atwood.

09:06.750 --> 09:09.460
She'll have to drop the charges
now that Frank's been arrested.

09:09.460 --> 09:10.920
I've scheduled a call
with Judge Malik

09:10.920 --> 09:13.250
to get
the paperwork moving.

09:13.250 --> 09:16.500
I'm getting you out of here,
Annalise, by the end of the day.

09:16.500 --> 09:17.830
Tomorrow at the latest.

09:17.830 --> 09:19.000
Trust me.

09:19.000 --> 09:20.920
I trusted you
to get me out on bail.

09:20.920 --> 09:22.920
Look how that went.

09:33.580 --> 09:35.120
Where did the car go after?

09:35.120 --> 09:37.580
Not sure, but we're checking
all the security cameras.

09:37.580 --> 09:39.040
And you still haven't found
Wes Gibbins' phone?

09:39.040 --> 09:41.710
No, so we're screwed.

09:41.710 --> 09:43.620
We're on record
that Keating acted alone.

09:43.620 --> 09:45.670
I know, but that doesn't prove
Delfino was involved.

09:45.670 --> 09:48.250
He's the last person
to see our victim alive.

09:48.250 --> 09:51.080
You think any jury's gonna
believe he didn't kill him?

09:52.580 --> 09:53.620
Come in.

09:55.500 --> 09:56.710
You wanted to see me?

09:56.710 --> 09:57.750
Close the door.

09:59.670 --> 10:00.960
What's this?

10:05.330 --> 10:07.170
We need you back
on the Keating case.

10:07.170 --> 10:08.960
What changed?

10:08.960 --> 10:11.620
Frank Delfino confessed to
killing Wes Gibbins last night.

10:11.620 --> 10:13.040
Doing it for Annalise.

10:13.040 --> 10:14.380
Of course.

10:16.920 --> 10:18.330
What do you need?

10:18.330 --> 10:20.920
To make sure
his story checks out.

10:20.920 --> 10:22.210
You know Laurel Castillo,
right?

10:26.380 --> 10:28.080
I haven't been back
in a hospital

10:28.080 --> 10:30.000
since my wife was sick.

10:30.000 --> 10:32.620
Ovarian cancer.

10:32.620 --> 10:36.830
The hardest thing --

10:36.830 --> 10:38.830
losing someone too soon.

10:42.040 --> 10:44.670
You still work
for the D.A.?

10:44.670 --> 10:46.750
Who do you think sent me?

10:50.710 --> 10:53.330
When did you know
you were pregnant?

11:01.750 --> 11:04.210
Frank turned himself in
last night.

11:06.500 --> 11:08.580
He says he killed Wes

11:08.580 --> 11:10.830
because he found out
about the baby.

11:10.830 --> 11:14.620
So...you tell Frank
you were pregnant?

11:24.000 --> 11:25.330
I don't feel well.

11:28.000 --> 11:29.330
So you didn't tell him.

11:29.330 --> 11:30.920
I want you to leave.

11:37.040 --> 11:39.670
I know what it's like to be
scared of Annalise, believe me.

11:39.670 --> 11:41.540
Call me
when you want to talk.

12:00.170 --> 12:01.500
Hi.

12:01.500 --> 12:03.000
Did Frank confess?

12:03.000 --> 12:04.750
Who told you that?

12:04.750 --> 12:06.790
Just tell me.

12:06.790 --> 12:07.960
Yes.

12:07.960 --> 12:09.120
Who told you?

12:10.960 --> 12:12.830
Ohh.

12:12.830 --> 12:15.880
Nate. He just wants to know
if Frank knew I was pregnant.

12:15.880 --> 12:16.750
Did he?

12:16.750 --> 12:18.330
No.

12:18.330 --> 12:19.920
I didn't even know.

12:19.920 --> 12:21.330
Which means he's lying.

12:21.330 --> 12:23.670
He's just trying
to save Annalise, right?

12:23.670 --> 12:25.580
I don't know.

12:28.380 --> 12:30.830
I'll call you back.

12:30.830 --> 12:32.290
Wait.

12:35.080 --> 12:37.120
You have another suspect
who has confessed.

12:37.120 --> 12:39.040
A suspect who has
every reason to do this

12:39.040 --> 12:40.500
at your client's bidding.

12:40.500 --> 12:42.080
If you don't believe him,
why hold him?

12:42.080 --> 12:43.920
That's the detectives' call.

12:43.920 --> 12:47.120
This office hasn't even decided
if we even want to charge him.

12:47.120 --> 12:49.250
Because you know you have
to release my client
the minute you do.

12:49.250 --> 12:51.420
We need more than
this very convenient confession

12:51.420 --> 12:52.960
to believe
a career criminal.

12:52.960 --> 12:54.880
So you're saying you have
no other evidence yet?

12:54.880 --> 12:56.920
Oh, we have evidence --
a mountain of it --

12:56.920 --> 12:59.500
and it all points
to Annalise Keating.

13:02.080 --> 13:04.920
Atwood's lying.

13:04.920 --> 13:06.790
They have evidence
against Frank,

13:06.790 --> 13:10.250
and if I can find it,
I can get Annalise released.

13:12.750 --> 13:14.120
You're tired.
So am I.

13:14.120 --> 13:16.000
But this helps us all.

13:17.960 --> 13:19.120
What do you need?

13:19.120 --> 13:21.000
Call Oliver.
Have him hack the D.A.

13:21.000 --> 13:22.250
No.

13:23.710 --> 13:25.460
He did it for Annalise
once already.

13:25.460 --> 13:27.210
That was before.

13:27.210 --> 13:28.790
Before what?

13:31.540 --> 13:33.420
He knows about Sam.

13:33.420 --> 13:35.210
How?

13:35.210 --> 13:36.580
I told him.

13:36.580 --> 13:37.880
You what?!
Why would you do that?

13:37.880 --> 13:39.580
'Cause I'm an ass.

13:39.580 --> 13:41.330
Look, he already promised
he wouldn't go to the police.

13:41.330 --> 13:42.580
You believe that?

13:42.580 --> 13:45.580
Well, we haven't been
arrested yet, have we?

13:45.580 --> 13:47.080
You thought things couldn't
get any worse, right?

13:47.080 --> 13:48.960
I'm gonna go talk to him.
No.

13:48.960 --> 13:50.920
You messed up.
Now it's my job to fix it.

13:50.920 --> 13:52.330
How is that your job?

13:52.330 --> 13:53.830
Who else is gonna be
the grown-up around here?

13:53.830 --> 13:55.210
Hey, BonBon's here.

13:55.210 --> 13:56.080
Oh, is that
what you were doing

13:56.080 --> 13:57.790
with the president
this morning?

13:57.790 --> 14:00.790
Because all I saw was
an entitled crazy person.

14:00.790 --> 14:02.670
I was saving our asses.

14:02.670 --> 14:05.500
You were defending Annalise
like she deserves it.

14:05.500 --> 14:07.250
If they sell her out,
which you know they want to do,

14:07.250 --> 14:09.120
then we all go down.

14:09.120 --> 14:10.750
Maybe we should.
No!

14:10.750 --> 14:12.170
When are we gonna stop
helping Annalise,

14:12.170 --> 14:13.420
when it only
makes things worse?

14:13.420 --> 14:15.580
You are the only one
getting us in trouble right now.

14:15.580 --> 14:17.040
Wes is dead.

14:17.040 --> 14:18.830
Annalise probably
killed him.

14:18.830 --> 14:19.830
She didn't.

14:19.830 --> 14:21.620
Oh, sorry.
Frank did.

14:21.620 --> 14:22.960
He's just
taking the fall.

14:22.960 --> 14:24.580
You would believe that.
Listen!

14:27.290 --> 14:30.500
Annalise is a mess.

14:30.500 --> 14:34.210
She is losing it in there,
and...

14:34.210 --> 14:37.380
I'm scared...

14:37.380 --> 14:39.170
more than
I should admit to you.

14:39.170 --> 14:42.250
So I need your help,
and so does she,

14:42.250 --> 14:46.670
and maybe you hate that --
and her.

14:46.670 --> 14:50.790
But it is your lives
on the line here, too.

14:50.790 --> 14:52.170
It's as simple as that.

14:59.000 --> 15:01.000
Well, looky who's back --
the boy-killer.

15:03.170 --> 15:05.500
What, you didn't think
I knew how to read?

15:05.500 --> 15:06.670
What was it?

15:06.670 --> 15:09.210
One of them
Mrs. Robinson type of things?

15:09.210 --> 15:11.710
Your boy toy got tired
of your sad old ta-tas,

15:11.710 --> 15:13.250
so you torched his ass?

15:13.250 --> 15:15.620
Leave it alone, girl.

15:15.620 --> 15:16.790
Well, ain't it
bad enough

15:16.790 --> 15:18.420
our men getting shot up
by the police.

15:18.420 --> 15:20.290
Now they got to worry
about us killing them, too?

15:20.290 --> 15:22.960
Like police don't frame
innocent people?

15:22.960 --> 15:24.460
She ain't innocent!

15:24.460 --> 15:26.500
Says right there
she offed her husband, too!

15:26.500 --> 15:27.710
Shoot, I'm scared, to be honest,

15:27.710 --> 15:29.380
like maybe
you're one of them black widows

15:29.380 --> 15:31.380
and you're gonna
come at me and Jas next.

15:31.380 --> 15:32.830
Hey!

15:46.170 --> 15:47.120
You asleep?

15:50.460 --> 15:52.170
I have 10 minutes
before my rounds,

15:52.170 --> 15:55.080
so I thought
I would sneak you a-these.

15:57.580 --> 15:59.040
Thanks.

16:04.620 --> 16:07.250
So, I heard you could
get discharged soon.

16:07.250 --> 16:08.500
Yeah.

16:08.500 --> 16:10.080
Any news from the police?

16:11.420 --> 16:12.670
Nope.

16:12.670 --> 16:14.330
Oh.

16:15.880 --> 16:17.920
Didn't I see that detective
in here this morning?

16:20.880 --> 16:23.750
Uh, I thought
you were on an O.B. rotation.

16:23.750 --> 16:25.580
I am.

16:25.580 --> 16:27.790
So how come
you were here this morning?

16:28.790 --> 16:29.960
I came to visit you.

16:31.750 --> 16:33.120
You never stopped by.

16:33.120 --> 16:35.040
Well, that's because
that guy was in here.

16:39.960 --> 16:41.000
Laurel?

16:43.420 --> 16:44.830
What's going on?

16:47.710 --> 16:49.920
We're not friends, Meggy.

16:51.250 --> 16:52.380
Maybe we could have been

16:52.380 --> 16:54.170
when Wes was still here,
but he's dead.

16:54.170 --> 16:57.750
And it's illegal for you to know
details about my medical care

16:57.750 --> 17:00.170
when you're not
actually my doctor, so...

17:04.580 --> 17:06.830
...I really need to sleep.

17:16.380 --> 17:18.460
Sit down.

17:18.460 --> 17:19.880
Why?

17:19.880 --> 17:21.250
Just sit.
Then we'll explain.

17:21.250 --> 17:23.080
My God. You're making this worse
than it has to be.

17:23.080 --> 17:24.330
You've said enough
on this topic,

17:24.330 --> 17:25.960
so you can
shut your mouth.

17:42.880 --> 17:45.500
We know you know,
Oliver.

17:45.500 --> 17:46.790
You told them.

17:46.790 --> 17:48.080
Don't look at him.
Right here.

17:49.500 --> 17:51.380
This is clearly
a stressful time for you,

17:51.380 --> 17:53.830
as it is for all of us,
and I'm sorry about that.

17:55.170 --> 17:56.750
Thanks.

17:56.750 --> 17:58.750
We understand that you don't
know any of the details.

17:58.750 --> 18:00.460
Yeah,
and I don't want to.

18:00.460 --> 18:01.960
I think that's smart,

18:01.960 --> 18:03.120
because all
you really need to know --

18:03.120 --> 18:04.670
He just said
that he doesn't want to know.

18:04.670 --> 18:07.250
Sam deserved it.

18:07.250 --> 18:09.580
Even Annalise would
tell you that if she could.

18:10.790 --> 18:11.920
Back here.

18:14.540 --> 18:17.750
Every action you take right now
has consequences for us.

18:17.750 --> 18:19.710
Michaela.
This is my life
on the line,

18:19.710 --> 18:21.250
and I've worked too hard
to have it ruined

18:21.250 --> 18:22.750
because someone
opened their fat mouth!

18:29.290 --> 18:32.380
You understand...right?

18:34.920 --> 18:37.040
I do.

18:37.040 --> 18:38.620
Great.

18:38.620 --> 18:41.000
Now you need
to hack the D.A.

18:45.960 --> 18:48.080
We checked every street cam
in a 10-mile radius.

18:48.080 --> 18:49.880
We can't locate Delfino's car
in any of them.

18:49.880 --> 18:52.540
So it's possible they separated
before Wes died.

18:52.540 --> 18:54.380
Delfino says he drove Wes
straight to Keating's house.

18:54.380 --> 18:55.830
I don't believe that.

18:55.830 --> 18:56.960
We have enough
to charge him.

18:56.960 --> 18:58.040
Give me more time.

18:58.040 --> 18:59.250
Why?

18:59.250 --> 19:00.830
I just need to think.
Please.

19:02.120 --> 19:03.170
Come in.

19:06.460 --> 19:07.500
Should I come back?

19:07.500 --> 19:08.750
No, we're done.

19:13.500 --> 19:14.880
Oh, keep it open.

19:16.290 --> 19:18.670
You're the one
who cried sexual harassment.

19:20.920 --> 19:23.580
Tell me you got something
out of the girl.

19:25.420 --> 19:26.790
She won't talk to me.

19:30.580 --> 19:32.080
Can I do anything else?

19:32.080 --> 19:34.620
Help me get a new job
after I get fired.

19:34.620 --> 19:36.210
Stop.
The second the press hears

19:36.210 --> 19:38.750
we wrongfully indicted
Annalise Keating, I'm done.

19:38.750 --> 19:40.830
Ship me back to Tulsa.

19:42.460 --> 19:44.330
Let me talk to Frank.

19:47.170 --> 19:48.960
No.

19:48.960 --> 19:50.120
I know the guy.

19:50.120 --> 19:52.120
And I'm damn good
at my job.

19:53.750 --> 19:55.620
You're sure
you don't want a lawyer?

19:55.620 --> 19:57.250
I waive my rights.

19:57.250 --> 19:59.290
Let's just get this over with
so you can charge me.

19:59.290 --> 20:02.790
See, I'm not sure
that's gonna happen.

20:04.210 --> 20:06.210
I confessed.

20:06.210 --> 20:07.880
You got me
on candid camera.

20:07.880 --> 20:09.210
What's so hard?

20:09.210 --> 20:11.120
You're lying
for Annalise.

20:11.120 --> 20:13.210
And I understand why.

20:13.210 --> 20:15.210
She's controlled you
for quite a long time.

20:15.210 --> 20:17.250
Y'all have got 15 minutes!

20:17.250 --> 20:19.710
Yeah, yeah.
I heard you. Shoot.

20:19.710 --> 20:21.290
Come on. Over here.

20:21.290 --> 20:23.420
Put your stuff there.

20:23.420 --> 20:26.420
Push to the front,
get in, get out.

20:28.420 --> 20:31.040
You were
just a sad, angry criminal.

20:31.040 --> 20:32.790
And Annalise showed up,
worked her magic,

20:32.790 --> 20:34.580
and got you 10 years free.

20:34.580 --> 20:38.580
And now you're sitting here,
paying her what she's owed.

20:40.120 --> 20:42.210
She don't look
as good as she did in the paper.

20:43.790 --> 20:45.750
She's still trying to keep
that weave tight, though.

20:47.880 --> 20:49.540
Why she ain't
turning around?

20:49.540 --> 20:51.120
'Cause she rude.

20:51.120 --> 20:52.330
Hey, yo!

20:52.330 --> 20:54.080
Why you kill that boy?

20:54.080 --> 20:55.620
Hey, I'm talking to you!

20:55.620 --> 20:57.170
Annalise had
nothing to do with this.

20:57.170 --> 20:58.580
Of course she did.

20:58.580 --> 21:00.120
She loved that kid.

21:00.120 --> 21:02.120
No, she told you
to be a good little soldier

21:02.120 --> 21:03.540
and take the fall for her.

21:03.540 --> 21:04.540
You deaf, bitch?

21:04.540 --> 21:07.000
I asked you a question.

21:07.000 --> 21:09.120
Why'd you kill that boy?

21:09.120 --> 21:10.710
I didn't.

21:10.710 --> 21:12.170
Oh!

21:12.170 --> 21:13.420
Like hell you didn't.

21:13.420 --> 21:16.500
Dumbass burnt down
her own big-ass crib, too.

21:16.500 --> 21:18.790
Guess lawyers ain't as smart
as we thought.

21:20.000 --> 21:21.380
Look at her running scared.

21:22.880 --> 21:25.000
You're lying for her.

21:25.000 --> 21:28.880
That camera shows Wes
got in your car at 4:24 p.m.,

21:28.880 --> 21:30.750
but the house didn't explode
until a few hours later.

21:30.750 --> 21:32.420
What happened in between?

21:34.790 --> 21:36.420
I'm done.

21:36.420 --> 21:38.080
Seriously.

21:38.080 --> 21:40.620
Release me, call a public
defender to get you off my back,

21:40.620 --> 21:41.790
but I'm done
being interrogated.

21:41.790 --> 21:44.000
You hear me? Done.

21:45.540 --> 21:47.540
Yo,
what this weave set you back?

21:47.540 --> 21:49.460
Got to be
at least half a G or so.

21:49.460 --> 21:51.120
Enough to keep me in smokes
till my trial.

21:51.120 --> 21:53.170
Get the hell away from me
before I beat your face!

21:53.170 --> 21:55.040
Oh. Huh.

21:55.040 --> 21:56.420
You gonna beat my ass?

21:56.420 --> 21:57.380
Let's see.

21:57.380 --> 21:59.880
Hey! Hey!

21:59.880 --> 22:02.210
You want to roll up on somebody,
let's do it.

22:02.210 --> 22:05.250
Or you just want to talk?

22:05.250 --> 22:07.080
That's right!
You better run!

22:07.080 --> 22:08.210
Better sleep
with one eye open, too.

22:12.210 --> 22:13.750
You trying to get killed?

22:20.670 --> 22:22.330
Here.

22:22.330 --> 22:24.210
The only thing
they like smelling more

22:24.210 --> 22:25.670
than a man in here
is fear.

22:25.670 --> 22:26.790
Take it!

22:26.790 --> 22:28.210
Keating!

22:32.080 --> 22:33.290
Visitor.

22:57.790 --> 22:59.040
I'm not
who you were expecting.

22:59.040 --> 23:00.120
No.

23:04.210 --> 23:07.040
I'm sorry
if this is a shock.

23:07.040 --> 23:11.040
It's just -- I had a meeting
with your students this morning.

23:11.040 --> 23:12.750
What?

23:12.750 --> 23:15.250
It's just protocol.
Honestly.

23:16.960 --> 23:20.000
Still,
talking with them,

23:20.000 --> 23:22.420
hearing how important
you are to them --

23:22.420 --> 23:24.540
What is this?

23:24.540 --> 23:26.920
'Cause if you're here
to fire me, I got that part.

23:26.920 --> 23:28.210
No.

23:28.210 --> 23:29.920
Then why are you here?

23:29.920 --> 23:31.040
As my A.A. friend?

23:32.210 --> 23:33.790
'Cause let me be clear --

23:33.790 --> 23:35.880
if anyone offers me any liquor
in here, I'm drinking it.

23:39.460 --> 23:42.000
Go.
Say what you came to say.

23:43.040 --> 23:44.500
Say it!

23:46.750 --> 23:48.920
I just came
to make sure you were okay.

23:48.920 --> 23:51.000
That's all.

23:52.500 --> 23:55.500
I'm sorry, Annalise.

24:04.790 --> 24:06.420
I'm fine.

24:06.420 --> 24:07.670
I know.

24:10.420 --> 24:12.000
Still, I'm sorry.

24:16.880 --> 24:18.170
You threatened him.

24:18.170 --> 24:19.750
Oh, please!
That was a gentle nudge.

24:19.750 --> 24:20.960
You want to see a threat?
Try me.

24:20.960 --> 24:22.540
Oh, my God,
you've lost it.

24:22.540 --> 24:24.210
I am the only one
holding us together right now.

24:24.210 --> 24:25.540
Because you're acting
like Mussolini right now.

24:25.540 --> 24:27.500
Mussolini got things done,
didn't he?

24:27.500 --> 24:29.170
It may come
as a surprise to you,

24:29.170 --> 24:32.290
but I was not always the glue
that held this group together.

24:33.710 --> 24:36.420
Yeah. I was
late to the party, too.

24:36.420 --> 24:38.620
Not...that it's a party.

24:38.620 --> 24:41.080
It's a...murder.

24:41.080 --> 24:42.380
That's bad, but...

24:43.790 --> 24:45.420
I just -- I get
how scary this can be,

24:45.420 --> 24:48.750
finding out about
all the...awfulness.

24:48.750 --> 24:53.420
So...I'm here
if you ever need to...talk

24:53.420 --> 24:56.080
or...you just...
want a hug.

24:56.080 --> 24:57.380
Michaela! Connor!

24:58.790 --> 25:00.290
What's wrong?

25:00.290 --> 25:02.460
Uh, I got into
Atwood's server

25:02.460 --> 25:03.960
looking for stuff
that they had on Frank,

25:03.960 --> 25:05.920
but it's mostly stuff
they had on Annalise.

25:05.920 --> 25:07.000
Oliver.

25:07.000 --> 25:08.620
They found a Jane Doe
in the woods,

25:08.620 --> 25:11.290
and the lab ran a bunch of DNA
tests to try to identify her.

25:11.290 --> 25:12.420
Who is it?

25:14.170 --> 25:15.620
Rebecca.

25:20.920 --> 25:22.330
It's the po-po.

25:22.330 --> 25:23.880
We must have triggered an alarm.
They knew we were hacking --

25:23.880 --> 25:25.380
No. No, no, no. I put up
a bunch of firewalls.

25:25.380 --> 25:26.750
Shut up and act normal.

25:33.290 --> 25:34.880
Did you find anything yet?

25:39.000 --> 25:40.080
Look at that.

25:41.670 --> 25:44.750
Either the D.A.'s office
is out of options

25:44.750 --> 25:47.250
or they decided
to send in the big guns.

25:47.250 --> 25:48.790
Nice to see you, too.

25:48.790 --> 25:50.670
New gig going well?

25:50.670 --> 25:53.710
It'd be a whole lot better
if you told me the truth.

25:53.710 --> 25:56.170
That's all I've done.

25:56.170 --> 25:57.290
Yet here I sit.

25:59.170 --> 26:01.460
No charge in sight.

26:07.670 --> 26:09.460
Wes didn't die
in the fire, man.

26:12.120 --> 26:14.540
The M.E. report
says he did.

26:14.540 --> 26:16.790
So did you,
in your...confession.

26:19.580 --> 26:22.580
You screwed up
with Annalise.

26:22.580 --> 26:24.620
She told me that
while you were away.

26:24.620 --> 26:27.120
So this is your way
of fixing things.

26:31.330 --> 26:33.460
Not everything's
about Annalise.

26:35.330 --> 26:36.580
Did Frank kill Rebecca?

26:36.580 --> 26:37.500
No.

26:37.500 --> 26:39.620
BonBon,
please don't lie to us.

26:39.620 --> 26:40.880
Why would I lie to you
right now?

26:40.880 --> 26:42.170
Are you being serious?

26:42.170 --> 26:43.670
I don't know anything
that you don't know.

26:43.670 --> 26:45.830
Please, just...
everyone breathe.

26:45.830 --> 26:46.960
Bonnie.

26:46.960 --> 26:48.580
Oh, God. What now?

26:48.580 --> 26:52.000
They have a lot more on Annalise
than just Rebecca --

26:52.000 --> 26:53.420
like, tons.

26:53.420 --> 26:57.540
They're investigating her
for Sam, the Hapstalls,

26:57.540 --> 26:59.670
Emily Sinclair,
Lila Stangard.

26:59.670 --> 27:01.080
I can't do this anymore.

27:01.080 --> 27:02.790
That's what
I've been trying to say.

27:02.790 --> 27:03.880
BonBon?

27:06.380 --> 27:08.500
You were right.

27:08.500 --> 27:10.330
They're not
going to stop.

27:10.330 --> 27:12.460
Even if they charge Frank
for Wes,

27:12.460 --> 27:14.420
they're just going to
keep coming at you.

27:14.420 --> 27:17.000
For Sam..

27:17.000 --> 27:18.500
Rebecca...

27:18.500 --> 27:19.790
everything.

27:26.380 --> 27:28.790
You need
to put it all on Frank.

27:31.040 --> 27:32.920
We'll go to Atwood,
ask for a deal,

27:32.920 --> 27:34.710
say you'll talk.

27:34.710 --> 27:37.040
Frank's a sociopath,
you were scared for your life,

27:37.040 --> 27:38.420
so you didn't
say anything,

27:38.420 --> 27:41.120
but that's the reason
he left town,

27:41.120 --> 27:43.330
so you only knew
for a few months.

27:43.330 --> 27:45.920
He owes you this.
He knows that.

27:45.920 --> 27:48.420
You act like
you're bringing me a solution.

27:48.420 --> 27:49.170
It is.

27:49.170 --> 27:51.250
It's a lie.

27:51.250 --> 27:54.250
It's the only shot
you have right now.

27:57.670 --> 27:59.670
Please.

28:09.880 --> 28:11.250
Is Annalise gonna do it?

28:11.250 --> 28:13.250
They're meeting with Atwood
right now.

28:15.170 --> 28:16.920
Russia.

28:16.920 --> 28:18.960
They don't extradite
to the U.S.

28:18.960 --> 28:21.170
They don't like gay people
there.

28:21.170 --> 28:22.880
Or black people.

28:22.880 --> 28:25.000
I'm assuming.

28:25.000 --> 28:27.710
Well, there have to be
other countries that --

28:27.710 --> 28:30.080
Don't Google countries
where we can seek asylum.

28:30.080 --> 28:31.500
The police might be
tracking our phones.

28:31.500 --> 28:33.170
All the more reason
for us to do something.

28:33.170 --> 28:34.830
I'm serious.

28:34.830 --> 28:36.880
We can -- We can break Laurel
out of here, pick up Oli,

28:36.880 --> 28:38.750
and Uber
straight to the airport.

28:38.750 --> 28:40.710
My passport's expired.

28:40.710 --> 28:42.250
It's $100 to renew.

28:42.250 --> 28:44.580
I didn't think I'd be able
to travel anywhere for a while.

28:44.580 --> 28:47.540
Well,
there goes that plan.

28:54.000 --> 28:56.580
Meggy's acting sketchy.

28:56.580 --> 29:00.290
She keeps visiting me.
She brought me jello.

29:00.290 --> 29:02.670
Isn't that just nice?

29:02.670 --> 29:06.000
Nice...or sketchy.

29:08.670 --> 29:10.420
Oh, God.

29:13.210 --> 29:15.620
How could we all
be so stupid?

29:17.460 --> 29:20.540
We have information relating
to various investigations.

29:20.540 --> 29:22.620
In exchange,
we'd like an immunity deal

29:22.620 --> 29:24.170
for all charges
against Ms. Keating.

29:24.170 --> 29:25.620
You mean
a "Get out of jail free" card

29:25.620 --> 29:27.420
for crimes orchestrated
by your client.

29:27.420 --> 29:29.460
Ms. Keating played no part
in these crimes.

29:29.460 --> 29:31.170
Therefore, there will be
no admission of guilt.

29:31.170 --> 29:32.670
Of course not.

29:32.670 --> 29:34.420
We came here
to negotiate in good faith.

29:34.420 --> 29:37.210
You mean to leverage bodies
for leniency.

29:37.210 --> 29:39.790
I'm sure the state is
as interested as we are

29:39.790 --> 29:41.540
in bringing closure
to the families

29:41.540 --> 29:42.830
of these unsolved cases.

29:42.830 --> 29:45.120
To be clear, these are
unsolved murder cases.

29:45.120 --> 29:46.750
We've told you everything
we're willing to tell you

29:46.750 --> 29:47.540
without a deal.

29:51.830 --> 29:53.920
One of your own students.

29:53.920 --> 29:55.750
An orphan
who fought his way through

29:55.750 --> 29:58.330
a difficult foster-care system
to become something.

29:58.330 --> 30:00.500
Ms. Keating
is clearly devastated

30:00.500 --> 30:02.210
by the loss
of her student.

30:02.210 --> 30:05.000
You were his professor,
and he trusted you.
It is in your interest

30:05.000 --> 30:06.500
to negotiate with us.
He didn't have
a mother figure,

30:06.500 --> 30:09.080
so you just stepped right in
and took advantage of that.

30:09.080 --> 30:10.710
Speaking to my client
in this way

30:10.710 --> 30:11.960
is an abuse of power.
But that's what you do.

30:13.380 --> 30:15.960
You get vulnerable, broken
people into your clutches,

30:15.960 --> 30:17.960
and you devour them.
That's enough.

30:17.960 --> 30:20.540
You insinuated yourself
into this boy's life.

30:20.540 --> 30:21.670
This meeting is over.

30:21.670 --> 30:23.420
You abused your power
as his teacher.

30:23.420 --> 30:24.750
You ruined his life.

30:24.750 --> 30:25.960
You did this.

30:25.960 --> 30:27.960
Burned this poor boy alive.

30:27.960 --> 30:30.960
Just think about the pain
that he felt as he died.

30:30.960 --> 30:32.460
The agony --

30:32.460 --> 30:34.380
You want to know pain?!
I'll show you pain!

30:34.380 --> 30:35.670
Uncuff me!

30:35.670 --> 30:37.540
Look at my pain!

30:37.540 --> 30:39.120
Uncuff me,
I'll show you pain!

30:39.120 --> 30:40.420
I'll show you pain.

30:40.420 --> 30:42.420
Uncuff me. Uncuff me!

30:42.420 --> 30:43.750
Look at my pain!

30:44.960 --> 30:46.040
No deal.

31:03.670 --> 31:05.250
Why is that funny?

31:05.250 --> 31:06.540
No offense, Dorothy,

31:06.540 --> 31:09.120
but your cupcakes
are dry and tasteless.

31:12.500 --> 31:14.830
Nobody ever likes
your cupcakes.

31:14.830 --> 31:18.830
My cupcakes are moist
and delicious.

31:20.170 --> 31:22.580
Men love my cupcakes.
Hey.

31:25.750 --> 31:26.790
How'd it go?

31:26.790 --> 31:28.120
She get the deal?

31:31.000 --> 31:33.540
I need to talk to Laurel
alone.

31:33.540 --> 31:35.210
Why?

31:35.210 --> 31:37.000
Just let me
talk to her.

31:40.290 --> 31:42.000
I'll be fine.

31:55.710 --> 31:56.960
What is it?

31:58.380 --> 32:00.040
You can fix this.

32:03.170 --> 32:05.920
Give me all your 9s.

32:05.920 --> 32:07.880
Go fish.

32:12.210 --> 32:14.580
What the hell
happened to you?

32:15.830 --> 32:17.790
Give me the blade.

32:17.790 --> 32:19.330
You're not gonna
kill yourself, are you?
Just give it to me!

32:34.170 --> 32:36.710
♪ Until we go down ♪

32:42.080 --> 32:44.620
♪ Until we go down ♪

32:49.960 --> 32:52.880
♪ Until we go down ♪

32:58.000 --> 33:00.670
♪ Until we go down ♪

33:22.790 --> 33:24.290
Hello.

33:24.290 --> 33:26.750
Would the lady like
to take off her clothes?

33:30.040 --> 33:32.120
I am Gustav, and I heard

33:32.120 --> 33:34.830
that the queen bee
is in need of a rubdown.

33:34.830 --> 33:36.500
Funny.

33:36.500 --> 33:40.040
I'm under explicit instructions
to make sure you feel...

33:40.040 --> 33:41.790
so very good.

33:41.790 --> 33:43.500
Asher, stop.

33:51.460 --> 33:53.120
Sorry.

33:53.120 --> 33:55.290
Just...
you were a boss today,

33:55.290 --> 33:59.920
and, yeah, it's hot,
but also it was nice, too.

33:59.920 --> 34:01.330
You know, feeling like
someone's in charge,

34:01.330 --> 34:04.960
especially...right now.

34:04.960 --> 34:07.960
So "Thank you"
is all that I w--

34:07.960 --> 34:11.170
Gustav was trying to say.

34:14.580 --> 34:16.620
Focus on
my shoulder blades.

34:16.620 --> 34:19.040
That's where
I carry all my stress.

34:19.040 --> 34:21.830
As my lady commands.

34:30.210 --> 34:31.620
Hey.

34:31.620 --> 34:33.210
Hey.

34:33.210 --> 34:34.880
Is Michaela behind you
to threaten me again?

34:43.330 --> 34:46.830
Can I say anything,
do anything?

34:48.420 --> 34:51.670
Yeah, you can tell me this is
all just a terrible joke.

34:51.670 --> 34:54.330
Like the time my brother told me
Mr. Giggles got hit by a car,

34:54.330 --> 34:55.710
and I cried for hours,

34:55.710 --> 34:58.330
until he brought the cat
into my bedroom

34:58.330 --> 35:00.880
and I learned
all about April Fools' Day.

35:10.620 --> 35:12.580
How have
you been doing this?

35:14.460 --> 35:18.540
Get up in the morning
and go to class,

35:18.540 --> 35:20.620
listen to me complain
about my role.

35:20.620 --> 35:22.540
You don't have a role.

35:22.540 --> 35:23.880
See?

35:23.880 --> 35:27.120
Even that -- pretending like
things can be normal again.

35:30.210 --> 35:32.920
I don't know how you've been
doing this by yourself

35:32.920 --> 35:34.000
this whole time.

35:37.960 --> 35:39.790
Now do you know why I wanted you
to go to the police?

35:45.960 --> 35:47.500
You were right
to break up with me.

35:47.500 --> 35:48.580
Stop.

35:48.580 --> 35:49.960
You wouldn't be
in this mess

35:49.960 --> 35:51.750
if it weren't
for my big mouth.

35:52.960 --> 35:55.080
I made you tell me.

35:55.080 --> 35:58.040
I should have
broken up with you, Oli.

35:58.040 --> 36:00.210
A long time ago.

36:01.960 --> 36:04.830
I should have rejected you
or made you hate me,

36:04.830 --> 36:08.460
but instead,
I...just needed you.

36:09.710 --> 36:12.540
I need you, too.

36:15.580 --> 36:16.830
Will you spoon me?

36:36.420 --> 36:38.080
Don't let go.

36:41.040 --> 36:42.750
I won't.

36:42.750 --> 36:46.170
We dated off and on
since first year.

36:46.170 --> 36:48.040
When you say
"off and on"...

36:48.040 --> 36:51.420
It wasn't
the most stable relationship.

36:51.420 --> 36:54.790
So you broke up last spring,
and then you started dating Wes.

36:54.790 --> 36:56.500
Then Frank killed him

36:56.500 --> 36:59.830
because of
your little love triangle?

36:59.830 --> 37:02.670
It's more complicated
than that.

37:05.920 --> 37:08.420
I saw Frank last week.

37:11.460 --> 37:14.210
I told him I was pregnant.

37:16.080 --> 37:17.750
And that it was Wes'.

37:17.750 --> 37:19.920
I would have
never told him

37:19.920 --> 37:21.920
if I ever thought
he would hurt Wes.

37:21.920 --> 37:24.040
Did Annalise
put you up to this?

37:24.040 --> 37:27.000
I haven't talked to Annalise
since the fire.

37:27.000 --> 37:29.620
And Bonnie -- she never
visited you in the hospital?

37:29.620 --> 37:31.710
The visitors records
will verify that.

37:35.460 --> 37:37.920
I remember something else
from that night.

37:39.920 --> 37:41.420
The doctors said
that it would happen,

37:41.420 --> 37:45.080
that the drugs would...
wear off

37:45.080 --> 37:47.290
and that I would
remember things.

37:53.750 --> 37:57.880
I, uh, saw Frank...

37:57.880 --> 38:00.000
before the explosion.

38:00.000 --> 38:01.750
Where?

38:01.750 --> 38:03.750
In the basement.

38:05.380 --> 38:07.460
He ran out
of the storm door.

38:13.170 --> 38:14.500
He did this.

38:23.540 --> 38:25.540
Annalise uses you.

38:25.540 --> 38:27.000
You do whatever she wants

38:27.000 --> 38:30.460
because you know
she'll get rid of you otherwise.

38:30.460 --> 38:32.710
What else
have you done for her?

38:34.500 --> 38:36.210
Killed people?

38:37.750 --> 38:39.620
Rebecca?

38:40.920 --> 38:43.500
Rebecca ran away.

38:43.500 --> 38:45.580
I know she was murdered.

38:48.170 --> 38:50.420
Congratulations.
You're finally getting charged.

38:50.420 --> 38:52.290
Frank Delfino,
you are being charged

38:52.290 --> 38:54.080
with the first-degree murder
of Wesley Gibbins.

38:54.080 --> 38:55.540
Your bail hearing
will be set

38:55.540 --> 38:57.460
under the rules
of criminal procedure.

38:57.460 --> 39:00.120
Until then, you will be residing
in the county prison.

39:00.120 --> 39:02.210
Clearly, you're still
hung up on this girl,

39:02.210 --> 39:05.080
so...why don't we find her?

39:05.080 --> 39:07.460
Can't be too hard to locate
a white girl with cornrows.

39:07.460 --> 39:08.460
You killed her.

39:08.460 --> 39:09.670
Stop.
Admit it.

39:09.670 --> 39:12.540
I killed your dad.

39:12.540 --> 39:14.710
Not Rebecca.

39:24.080 --> 39:26.210
You know
Frank didn't do this.

39:26.210 --> 39:27.750
An eyewitness placed him
at the scene.

39:27.750 --> 39:28.960
We had no choice
but to charge him.

39:28.960 --> 39:30.170
Frank said
he killed Wes in the fire,

39:30.170 --> 39:32.120
but he died before that,
according to the M.E.

39:32.120 --> 39:33.460
That was
her initial report.

39:33.460 --> 39:34.460
Then run a second autopsy!

39:34.460 --> 39:35.580
That's not necessary.

39:35.580 --> 39:37.210
Because it's a cover-up?

39:38.330 --> 39:39.920
From where I stand,

39:39.920 --> 39:42.620
the suspicious person
in all of this is you.

39:42.620 --> 39:44.380
Is that it?

39:44.380 --> 39:46.420
You're actually the one
covering up for Annalise?

39:46.420 --> 39:48.420
My job here
is to ask questions.

39:48.420 --> 39:50.670
You're asking
the wrong ones.

39:53.880 --> 39:55.250
Am I?

39:55.250 --> 39:59.040
Go home and get some sleep.
Clearly, you need it.

39:59.040 --> 40:00.790
Take me back
to the police station.

40:00.790 --> 40:02.580
Why?

40:02.580 --> 40:04.120
You gonna tattle on us?

40:04.120 --> 40:05.080
Maybe.

40:10.500 --> 40:11.960
Fine.

40:14.620 --> 40:16.290
I'll walk.

40:39.330 --> 40:41.290
They charged Frank.

40:41.290 --> 40:43.250
And?

40:45.830 --> 40:49.710
They charged him
as your co-conspirator.

40:57.580 --> 41:00.080
I thought that
I could do this, Annalise.

41:02.000 --> 41:03.210
I really did.

41:03.210 --> 41:06.500
I thought...
that this would get you out.

41:06.500 --> 41:07.500
It's okay.

41:07.500 --> 41:09.210
It's not.

41:09.210 --> 41:10.790
Bonnie.

41:17.000 --> 41:19.040
I deserve this.

41:32.620 --> 41:34.330
We got a puppy problem.

41:34.330 --> 41:35.620
What?

41:35.620 --> 41:37.830
He knows Rebecca's dead.

41:37.830 --> 41:39.250
How?

41:39.250 --> 41:40.420
Cops, I guess.

41:40.420 --> 41:41.830
Are you still following him?

41:41.830 --> 41:43.000
Yeah.

41:45.170 --> 41:46.790
You want me to do
anything else?

41:46.790 --> 41:48.580
Just don't lose him.

41:48.580 --> 41:50.540
I'll call you soon.
