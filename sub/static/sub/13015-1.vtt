01:24.371 --> 01:27.787
<i>Ray, where are you going?</i>

01:27.875 --> 01:29.951
<i>Come back to bed.</i>

03:57.349 --> 04:00.932
Watch it, you miserable little...

04:29.881 --> 04:34.127
Queenie!

04:34.218 --> 04:39.460
'Morning, Walter!

04:39.556 --> 04:44.764
Good girl. Their lawn
needed fertilizing anyway.

05:26.935 --> 05:30.848
<i>I am your war machine</i>

05:30.938 --> 05:35.185
<i>Yes, I am your ghetto scene</i>

05:35.276 --> 05:39.736
<i>Well, I am your love of money</i>

05:39.822 --> 05:43.522
<i>'Cause I found me a little honey</i>

05:43.617 --> 05:45.858
<i>- I'm working for the machine
- Good morning, Lieutenant.</i>

05:45.911 --> 05:47.156
Mrs Rumsfield.

05:47.246 --> 05:49.737
<i>Hi, Ricky.</i>

05:53.084 --> 05:56.334
<i>I'm working for the machine, baby</i>

05:58.214 --> 05:59.775
Oh, Mr Rumsfield, be careful.
Queenie...

06:01.467 --> 06:04.718
- Goddam it.
- Uh-oh.

06:04.804 --> 06:07.841
Walter. Walter!

06:08.808 --> 06:11.559
<i>- Walter!
- I love that dude.</i>

06:11.643 --> 06:14.051
- Walter! Walter!
- Mark!

06:16.648 --> 06:18.641
What are you doing up?

06:18.734 --> 06:23.396
Walter's dog just took a dump
on Rumsfield's lawn again.

06:23.489 --> 06:25.896
Good, honey.

06:25.991 --> 06:27.900
I know you're in there, old man!

06:27.993 --> 06:31.242
- Honey, honey, the neighbours.
- Listen up, mister.

06:31.329 --> 06:33.405
That piece of scum,
barking rat of yours...

06:33.498 --> 06:36.071
has just taken his
last dump on my lawn!

06:36.167 --> 06:41.410
I find one more... just one... I'm gonna
catch him and staple his ass shut!

06:43.591 --> 06:45.916
- I'm gonna do it right now.
- No, no, no! Honey, don't.

06:46.010 --> 06:48.501
<i>Come on. Let's go home.</i>

06:51.014 --> 06:54.928
<i>Hey, honey, I think we should move.</i>

06:58.188 --> 07:01.604
We got an arms dealer across the
street and a crazy person down it.

07:01.691 --> 07:03.601
All they do is fight.

07:03.693 --> 07:05.935
Is this sweet enough?

07:06.029 --> 07:08.437
Now these new next-door
neighbours... What is their name?

07:08.532 --> 07:10.607
- The Klopeks?
- Mm-hmm.

07:10.699 --> 07:14.282
- Is that a Slavic name?
- I don't know.

07:14.370 --> 07:19.115
They've been here a month. Think they're
gonna do something about their yard?

07:22.044 --> 07:24.962
Are you gonna eat any of this?

07:25.047 --> 07:29.958
Oh, no. I got that thing
with my stomach again.

07:30.051 --> 07:32.838
I wonder what was going
on over there last night.

07:32.929 --> 07:36.298
- I knew this was gonna happen.
- What?

07:36.391 --> 07:39.890
- Nothing.
- What did you know was going to happen?

07:39.978 --> 07:41.887
It's started already. Look at you.

07:41.980 --> 07:43.972
You're gonna sit around
all week doing nothing...

07:44.065 --> 07:48.644
get bored out of your mind and go
back to work worse than you are now.

07:48.736 --> 07:50.645
No, I'm not.

07:50.737 --> 07:54.901
Please, let's pack up the car and go
to the lake. Just get away and rest.

07:54.992 --> 07:58.824
You should see yourself. You were
up at dawn watching a dog poop.

07:58.912 --> 08:01.154
You call going up to
the lake resting?

08:01.248 --> 08:04.332
It is four hours of driving on the
tollway in holiday traffic...

08:04.418 --> 08:06.624
to sit in some dank, wet cabin...

08:06.712 --> 08:08.621
and wait for that neighbour
with the enormous head...

08:08.714 --> 08:10.124
to get drunk and fall down.

08:10.214 --> 08:13.334
He's a hydrocephalic. I don't think
that you should make fun of him.

08:13.426 --> 08:15.833
Honey, that's not
my idea of restful.

08:15.928 --> 08:19.178
This is restful: Hanging around
the house, just being lazy.

08:19.265 --> 08:22.515
That's what I want to do.
I just wanna... hang around.

08:22.602 --> 08:24.511
Be lazy, listen to the ball game...

08:24.604 --> 08:27.474
and drink a couple hundred beers.

08:27.565 --> 08:30.020
<i>Smoke an occasional
cigar... outside.</i>

08:30.108 --> 08:33.192
I'll fix the barbecue in
the backyard. I'll do that.

08:33.278 --> 08:37.027
This is what I need, Carol.
I need... this.

08:37.115 --> 08:41.113
And at the end of the week,
I'll be a brand new human being.

08:41.203 --> 08:43.443
It's your vacation.

09:07.978 --> 09:12.935
Shh! Quiet.

09:21.491 --> 09:27.078
<i>Art's got a gun.</i>

09:29.499 --> 09:31.656
Art!

09:31.750 --> 09:35.451
<i>Hey, hi, Ray.
Are you guys eatin' in there?</i>

09:35.546 --> 09:38.500
You know how Suzette is
about her bird feeder.

09:38.590 --> 09:40.666
These crows start showing
up out of nowhere.

09:40.759 --> 09:42.668
She's all over my back
to get rid of 'em.

09:42.761 --> 09:45.003
"The crows are too big for
the bird feeder," she says.

09:45.097 --> 09:47.670
- I don't remember seeing crows around before.
- Oh, big bastards too.

09:47.766 --> 09:50.173
That's why I got the gun.
I'm gonna pop a few.

09:50.268 --> 09:53.185
Why didn't you go with
Suzette to her mother's?

09:53.271 --> 09:57.518
Hey, I'm eating here. Can you imagine me
and the two of them alone for a week?

09:57.608 --> 09:59.684
I'd rather chew broken glass.

09:59.777 --> 10:04.190
Uh-uh, this is gonna be a big
week for the bachelor kid.

10:04.282 --> 10:06.274
<i>Vince.</i>

10:06.367 --> 10:08.858
<i>Vince.</i>

10:08.953 --> 10:10.909
How come you're not at work, Ray?

10:10.996 --> 10:14.281
- I took the week off.
- A week off?

10:14.374 --> 10:16.865
That's great. Are you guys going
to the lake or something?

10:16.960 --> 10:19.202
- No, the backyard.
- Backyard?

10:19.296 --> 10:21.703
I just want to hang around
the house and relax.

10:21.798 --> 10:25.713
Relax? Good luck with those
maniacs you got living next door.

10:25.802 --> 10:28.376
- Have you met the Klopeks yet?
- No.

10:28.472 --> 10:31.222
No, I haven't. Nobody
on the block has.

10:31.307 --> 10:35.719
But I did talk to the real estate
broad that sold them the place.

10:35.811 --> 10:39.643
Apparently, their last house
only burnt to the ground.

10:39.732 --> 10:42.223
- Really?
- Yep.

10:42.318 --> 10:46.861
A hideous, raging inferno.

10:48.115 --> 10:50.071
Neighbours from hell.

10:52.327 --> 10:54.236
Maybe.

10:54.329 --> 10:58.077
Whatever it is, I'm glad I'm not
the one who lives right next door.

10:58.166 --> 11:02.911
Come on, let's face it.
These Klopeks are strange.

11:03.004 --> 11:05.165
I've been watching that house
ever since they moved in.

11:05.173 --> 11:07.925
No one goes in. No one comes out.

11:08.009 --> 11:10.416
No visitors. No deliveries.

11:10.511 --> 11:12.468
What do you think
they're eatin', Ray?

11:14.431 --> 11:17.432
Well, maybe these people just
want to keep to themselves, Art.

11:17.518 --> 11:19.594
Remember when the
Knapps lived next door?

11:19.686 --> 11:21.928
How many conversations did you
have with the Knapps? I had two.

11:22.022 --> 11:24.098
- Oh, come on. - They didn't even
say goodbye when they moved.

11:24.191 --> 11:26.764
Oh, please. Don't
even compare the two.

11:26.860 --> 11:29.232
At least, if they weren't
conversational...

11:29.321 --> 11:30.945
the Knapps were semi-normal.

11:31.030 --> 11:33.910
They worked in their yard. They mowed
their lawn. They had a lawn to mow.

11:33.950 --> 11:38.777
These Klopeks... We don't even
know how many of them there are.

11:38.871 --> 11:40.947
<i>There are three of them.</i>

11:41.040 --> 11:43.875
They only come out at night.

11:43.960 --> 11:46.451
Ricky Butler says they're
nocturnal feeders.

11:46.546 --> 11:48.040
Oh, Ricky Butler says.

11:48.131 --> 11:51.545
Last week when I was up on the
roof with my telescope...

11:51.633 --> 11:53.875
I saw them in their backyard.

11:53.969 --> 11:57.753
- What were they doing, honey?
- Digging.

11:59.141 --> 12:03.185
- Kind of like grave diggers?
- Maybe.

12:03.270 --> 12:05.891
All right, that's enough
of this conversation.

12:05.981 --> 12:09.895
I want you to stop spying on
the Klopeks with Ricky Butler.

12:09.984 --> 12:14.064
And I'd like you to stop filling his
head with such half-cocked theories.

12:14.155 --> 12:18.235
- Where you goin'?
- I'm gonna change into my vacation togs.

12:18.325 --> 12:20.401
Are you done with your eggs?

12:23.247 --> 12:26.912
I'm gonna mix the zinnias in
with the rest of the flowers.

12:27.001 --> 12:28.910
The man at the nursery said...

12:29.003 --> 12:33.213
- Boy, that really burns my ass.
- What?

12:33.298 --> 12:38.540
<i>That old fart. He's got the
best lawn on the block.</i>

12:40.180 --> 12:43.595
And you know why?

12:43.683 --> 12:48.926
Because he trains his
dog to crap in my yard.

12:49.022 --> 12:54.644
<i>Hey, Mrs Rumsfield.</i>

12:54.735 --> 12:57.308
No tan lines this morning.

12:57.404 --> 13:01.272
<i>Looks nice.</i>

13:01.366 --> 13:04.700
<i>That kid next door is a meatball.</i>

13:08.707 --> 13:12.040
<i>Peterson.</i>

13:12.126 --> 13:16.290
He came out in his robe last night when
the foreigners were making that racket.

13:16.380 --> 13:18.420
He didn't do one thing.

13:18.508 --> 13:23.134
<i>So, what are you gonna do first?</i>

13:23.221 --> 13:25.130
I don't know.

13:25.223 --> 13:27.796
- Hey, did I show you my new tools?
- No.

13:27.892 --> 13:30.299
These are great.

13:30.393 --> 13:33.478
Carol's father gave them
to me for Christmas.

13:33.563 --> 13:36.137
Huh?

13:36.233 --> 13:39.815
- Look.
- Oh, those are beauties.

13:39.903 --> 13:42.690
- You gonna build something with those?
- I think so.

13:42.781 --> 13:45.698
<i>Probably.</i>

13:46.118 --> 13:48.822
Hey, what time does
the ball game go on?

13:48.912 --> 13:51.069
I think it's at about 1:00.

13:51.163 --> 13:53.452
<i>You want to go down to the deli and
get one of those beef sandwiches?</i>

13:53.541 --> 13:57.490
<i>No. I'm thinking of getting one of
those electric garage door openers...</i>

13:57.586 --> 14:00.504
<i>And installing it.</i>

14:07.680 --> 14:10.086
Ray. Ray!

14:10.181 --> 14:12.174
<i>Ray, come here.</i>

14:17.939 --> 14:19.896
What is it?

14:22.735 --> 14:25.191
It's my neighbour.

14:26.406 --> 14:31.826
Hey, one of the Huns
came out of the cave.

15:05.943 --> 15:08.730
Why don't you go say hi?

15:10.155 --> 15:12.397
Well, yeah, I guess I could.

15:12.491 --> 15:15.408
This would be the perfect time.

15:15.494 --> 15:18.827
If you go talk to him, we
could see what he's like. Go.

15:18.914 --> 15:21.239
You could say hi to him too.

15:21.333 --> 15:23.733
- But he's your neighbour.
- No, he's your neighbour as well.

15:23.794 --> 15:26.082
But you share a
property line with him.

15:26.171 --> 15:28.744
We're all on the same
block, so you could go too.

15:28.840 --> 15:31.924
We're all in the same town,
but you're next to him.

15:32.009 --> 15:34.251
<i>If he was gonna borrow anything,
he'd come over to your place.</i>

15:34.345 --> 15:36.966
<i>Well, he's busy now.</i>

15:37.056 --> 15:39.547
He's not busy. Now he's goin' in.
Go now because if...

15:39.642 --> 15:44.304
<i>He's going back in. If you were gonna
say hi, you should probably...</i>

15:44.396 --> 15:46.852
He's going into the house.
You're gonna lose him.

15:46.941 --> 15:49.266
<i>He's gonna go in...</i>

15:49.360 --> 15:51.679
- Now you've blown it, haven't you?
- No, I didn't blow it.

15:51.694 --> 15:53.770
- Chicken. Chicken.
- He went into his house.

15:53.863 --> 15:56.105
I'm not chicken because
he went into his house.

15:56.199 --> 15:59.698
You look like a chicken in front of
your son and everything. Your son.

15:59.786 --> 16:01.695
<i>Come on.</i>

16:01.788 --> 16:05.323
- If it's suddenly a big deal, let's just
go say hello. - Hey, hey, it's a joke!

16:05.416 --> 16:07.326
- Let's say hello.
- Why so edgy?

16:07.418 --> 16:09.328
- Come on, come on.
- Try decaf.

16:09.420 --> 16:12.290
They're daring each other
to ring the doorbell.

16:12.381 --> 16:15.584
We shouldn't stare like this.

16:15.676 --> 16:18.297
Why don't we both go say
hello, or are you chicken?

16:18.387 --> 16:20.426
Go for it, Mr Peterson! Yes!

16:20.514 --> 16:24.642
<i>- Whoo!
- Now everybody's watching us.</i>

16:24.726 --> 16:26.636
<i>- Good going, man!
- Yeah, okay, yeah.</i>

16:26.728 --> 16:29.813
I'll go in with you.
Sure. No problem.

16:29.898 --> 16:32.305
Let's go.

17:05.640 --> 17:09.852
<i>There's bars on the
basement windows.</i>

17:11.979 --> 17:14.378
<i>- They got holes in their porch too.
- That was a booby trap.</i>

17:14.440 --> 17:16.348
- You okay?
- Yeah.

17:16.442 --> 17:19.015
- I'm not gonna pay for that.
- We shouldn't pay for that. We should sue them.

17:19.111 --> 17:24.354
Well, um, let's... Let's say hello.

17:42.175 --> 17:44.381
Hey.

17:48.598 --> 17:51.514
Get the hose. Hang on, men!

17:55.896 --> 17:59.182
<i>Run to me! Run to water!</i>

18:02.986 --> 18:05.656
Ray, over here! Run to water!

18:05.739 --> 18:08.776
<i>Run to me! Come on!</i>

18:29.554 --> 18:32.589
<i>I think they're gone, Mark.
I think they're gone!</i>

18:32.681 --> 18:35.432
- You men hit?
- I cannot believe you did that.

18:35.517 --> 18:37.678
- Neither can I.
- I cannot believe it! That was great.

18:37.686 --> 18:40.437
The same thing happened to me
last week. I was over there.

18:40.522 --> 18:43.772
It wasn't bees though.
It was a foaming squirrel.

18:45.360 --> 18:51.232
In Southeast Asia, we'd call
this type of thing "bad karma."

19:15.096 --> 19:18.465
<i>Honey, bee stings don't heal
if you keep playing with them.</i>

19:18.558 --> 19:21.808
<i>If we had gone to the lake, I'd
have twice as many of these.</i>

19:21.895 --> 19:26.307
<i>- It isn't like anything you said
is coming true. - Where are you going?</i>

19:26.399 --> 19:28.641
<i>I can't walk away without
you asking where I'm going?</i>

19:28.735 --> 19:32.317
<i>I'm going to Paris, France. I'm
going to Banff, Canada, all right?</i>

19:32.404 --> 19:34.480
<i>- That's where I'm going.
- Are you taking the dog?</i>

19:34.573 --> 19:37.146
Yeah, yeah. I'm taking
the dog for a walk.

19:46.919 --> 19:48.828
No, wait, wait, wait.

19:48.921 --> 19:51.671
Hey, Vince, let's
go over here, huh?

19:51.756 --> 19:53.832
Let's not go that way tonight.

19:55.092 --> 19:58.010
Here's a nice yard.
It's a good yard.

19:58.095 --> 20:00.135
Hey, you with the dog!

20:02.100 --> 20:04.507
<i>Hey, keep that mutt
off my lawn, will ya?</i>

20:04.602 --> 20:06.511
All right. Have a field day.

20:09.065 --> 20:12.344
He comes here to smoke cigars. His wife
won't let him. He doesn't know I know that.

20:12.400 --> 20:14.808
Hi, Ray. How ya doin', bud?

20:14.903 --> 20:17.655
- Hey, there, Mr Peterson.
- Good to see you.

20:17.739 --> 20:20.657
- Wouldn't need a lighter, would you?
- Thanks.

20:20.742 --> 20:24.822
- It is a lovely night, isn't it?
- Yeah, green sky tonight.

20:26.748 --> 20:31.493
Green sky at morning:
Neighbour take warning.

20:34.755 --> 20:37.329
Green sky at night?

20:37.424 --> 20:40.591
Neighbour take flight.

20:42.263 --> 20:47.174
<i>Did you ever see the movie
The Sentinel, Mr Peterson?</i>

20:47.268 --> 20:49.188
It's about the old guy who
owned the apartment...

20:49.270 --> 20:52.388
which is kind of like
the gateway to hell.

20:53.773 --> 20:55.682
No, I didn't see that.

20:55.775 --> 21:01.066
Oh, well, I was doing
some thinking.

21:01.156 --> 21:05.533
And, you know, being that their
last house burned down and all...

21:05.618 --> 21:09.533
it's like, maybe, somebody
left the gate open.

21:12.332 --> 21:17.208
It's them. They're
movin' around again.

21:17.296 --> 21:21.708
It was a night just like
this that it happened.

21:21.800 --> 21:23.709
What happened, Mr Weingartner?

21:23.802 --> 21:27.218
It was a long time ago.
Hinkley Hills was a lot smaller then.

21:27.306 --> 21:32.547
Safer too. You never had to lock your
doors. Everybody knew everybody.

21:32.643 --> 21:36.059
I must have been maybe
nine, ten years old.

21:36.147 --> 21:39.064
- You know where the big mall is?
- Yeah.

21:39.150 --> 21:41.230
There used to be a big
drugstore on the corner there.

21:41.319 --> 21:44.403
- It had a big soda fountain. Remember?
- Yeah.

21:44.489 --> 21:47.573
The guy who ran it was a
rotund guy, had glasses.

21:47.658 --> 21:50.231
His name was Skip.
Lived over on Elm.

21:50.327 --> 21:53.577
Had a wife, a couple kids.
Not too sharp.

21:53.663 --> 21:57.246
The guy's 40 years old, he's wearing
a paper hat and making cherry Cokes.

21:57.334 --> 21:59.907
It's a cinch he's not running
for governor, right?

22:00.003 --> 22:02.411
Anyway, it got hot that summer.

22:02.506 --> 22:04.582
It got real hot. It was sweltering.

22:04.674 --> 22:07.248
<i>That heat where your underwear
sweats and it crawls up the...</i>

22:07.344 --> 22:09.253
Anyway, it's hot, okay?

22:09.346 --> 22:13.923
And they start smelling this
really vile stench over on Elm...

22:14.016 --> 22:16.768
and they figure it's
comin' from Skip's place.

22:16.852 --> 22:18.761
No one wants to say anything.

22:18.854 --> 22:21.096
Do you knock on the guy's door,
"Hi, your house stinks"?

22:21.190 --> 22:23.763
So people are trying
to ignore it, right?

22:23.859 --> 22:27.442
They're trying to pretend it isn't
happening. You know those pine things?

22:27.530 --> 22:29.606
They're trying to cover up with those
pine things that you can put in cars.

22:29.698 --> 22:32.782
People are hanging those
on their porches.

22:34.869 --> 22:38.285
- Oh, you think that's funny, Ricky?
- Well, yeah.

22:38.373 --> 22:40.615
Let me tell you what happened next.

22:40.708 --> 22:44.124
The state health inspector
shows up. They talk to Skip.

22:44.212 --> 22:46.288
He says he's got a sump
pump problem. They leave.

22:46.381 --> 22:48.587
The guy's got a sewer problem.
He says he'll look after it.

22:48.675 --> 22:50.465
Everything's okay, right?

22:50.551 --> 22:52.460
Wrong. A couple hours later...

22:52.553 --> 22:54.841
there's smoke pouring out of
the windows of Skip's house.

22:54.930 --> 22:56.970
- The firemen go in. Know what they find?
- What?

22:57.057 --> 22:59.631
Skip's family, dead. Murdered...

22:59.726 --> 23:03.345
by Skip... weeks earlier...
with an ice pick.

23:03.439 --> 23:06.523
<i>Yeah, the guy killed
his whole family...</i>

23:06.608 --> 23:10.142
With an ice pick.

23:11.571 --> 23:14.488
Yeah. Yeah, just put 'em
in the cool basement...

23:14.574 --> 23:19.152
covered 'em up with a sheet and went
back to makin' treats for the townsfolk.

23:19.245 --> 23:23.824
Only Skip didn't count on there
being a big heat wave that summer.

23:23.916 --> 23:27.665
You know what all those people
were smelling on Elm, Ricky?

23:27.753 --> 23:29.830
What?

23:29.922 --> 23:32.163
Skip's family's bodies...

23:32.257 --> 23:35.840
decomposing in the summer heat.

23:35.927 --> 23:39.012
Apparently, one day Skip made just
one-too-many lemon phosphates.

23:39.097 --> 23:42.264
El snappo.

23:42.350 --> 23:48.223
I remember that. I remember hearing
about that when I was a kid.

23:48.315 --> 23:53.272
They-They tore down the
soda fountain that fall.

23:53.360 --> 23:56.860
These towns are full of those stories.
They're happening right under your nose.

23:56.947 --> 23:58.940
You know, speaking of noses...

23:59.033 --> 24:01.702
ever since this family has
moved to this block...

24:01.786 --> 24:05.368
I've been noticing a
weird kind of odour.

24:05.456 --> 24:07.698
Kind of like death.

24:12.504 --> 24:15.920
Jump a little higher, Spud Webb.

24:16.007 --> 24:18.379
- Oh, slam dunk!
- Sorry, Mr Peterson. It was a mistake.

24:18.468 --> 24:20.377
- Well, it wasn't a mistake.
- Don't apologize.

24:20.470 --> 24:22.795
- I'm goin' home.
- Oh, come on.

24:22.889 --> 24:26.472
- Don't be a weenie. It was a joke!
- I'm sorry, Mr Peterson.

24:26.559 --> 24:30.936
I'm gonna go do something productive.
I'm gonna go watch television.

24:31.230 --> 24:34.231
<i>The answer is:</i>

24:34.316 --> 24:36.225
<i>- What is Lincoln's birthday.
- Addley?</i>

24:36.318 --> 24:38.227
<i>- What is Memorial Day?
- Memorial Day is it. Select.</i>

24:38.320 --> 24:40.229
They combined Lincoln's birthday with
Washington's. It's one weekend now.

24:40.322 --> 24:42.231
- It's always flip-flopping.
- It's one weekend now.

24:42.324 --> 24:44.732
<i>"Remain calm, float with arms stretched
out at right angles to the body..."</i>

24:44.827 --> 24:47.662
That's what you used to say
to me in college, right?

24:47.746 --> 24:52.407
- What about your parents?
- They're not home 'til Thursday.

24:56.003 --> 24:59.419
Gail, I swear to God, this is
better than anything on television.

24:59.507 --> 25:02.424
- Why can't we go to a movie?
- "A movie"?

25:02.510 --> 25:05.083
That's not real.
It's the same as television.

25:05.179 --> 25:07.753
Trust me. This is real.

25:07.849 --> 25:10.220
This is my neighbourhood.

25:12.185 --> 25:15.103
<i>Here he comes, right on schedule.</i>

25:17.107 --> 25:20.891
God, I love this street.

25:31.537 --> 25:33.494
Ray.

25:33.581 --> 25:35.490
- What?
- Who was Mussolini?

25:35.583 --> 25:37.492
"How sweet it is" was, uh...

25:37.585 --> 25:39.624
<i>- Right again.
- Business and Industry for 200.</i>

25:39.712 --> 25:42.119
<i>In the McDonald's corporate
think tank, executives...</i>

25:42.214 --> 25:44.788
- Art, we're watching the show.
- What does he want?

25:44.884 --> 25:48.964
I don't know. But I'll be back
in time for Final Jeopardy.

25:49.054 --> 25:51.212
<i>Nebraskans for 1,000, please.</i>

25:51.306 --> 25:55.932
<i>Okay, the show's started.
Check it out.</i>

25:56.019 --> 25:59.554
You see the guy with the curly hair?
That's Mr Peterson.

25:59.647 --> 26:03.016
<i>He's this sceptic. He's basically
grounded in reality...</i>

26:03.109 --> 26:05.861
<i>and he doesn't want to believe his
neighbours are up to something strange.</i>

26:05.945 --> 26:09.030
<i>'Cause if they were, he'd
have to deal with it.</i>

26:09.115 --> 26:12.732
Okay, now see the fat guy?
That's Mr Weingartner.

26:12.826 --> 26:14.866
<i>He thinks the Klopeks
are really evil...</i>

26:14.953 --> 26:17.527
<i>and that they're building a
dungeon in their basement.</i>

26:17.623 --> 26:21.703
<i>He and Mr Rumsfield decided to
do a little snooping tonight.</i>

26:21.794 --> 26:23.786
<i>This should be good.</i>

26:25.631 --> 26:27.540
Shh, shh, shh.

26:33.137 --> 26:36.222
- What is this?
- It's an infrared scope.

26:36.307 --> 26:38.976
<i>Snipers use it for night vision.</i>

26:39.060 --> 26:40.720
What are we gonna do with it?

26:40.812 --> 26:42.721
Get a look in those barred-
up basement windows.

26:42.814 --> 26:44.890
Come here.

26:47.652 --> 26:50.735
I've been thinking about it. I don't
think we should go through with this.

26:50.821 --> 26:52.231
Are you a 'fraidy cat?

26:52.322 --> 26:55.240
No, I just think things
have gone off the deep end.

26:55.325 --> 26:59.572
Infrared night vision scopes? What are
we gonna do next, tap their phone?

26:59.663 --> 27:01.572
That can be arranged.

27:01.665 --> 27:04.416
Then all we have to do is burn
a cross on their front lawn.

27:04.501 --> 27:05.912
Shh.

27:06.002 --> 27:08.920
- Quiet.
- You hear that?

27:09.005 --> 27:10.914
<i>I thought that was just me.</i>

27:11.006 --> 27:13.758
- It's a low-frequency hum or something.
- It's getting louder.

27:13.843 --> 27:16.416
Listen.

27:16.512 --> 27:19.264
Is that a transformer or something?

27:19.348 --> 27:21.257
The goddam power company.

27:21.350 --> 27:25.099
But I can't... Where
is it coming from?

27:25.187 --> 27:28.687
<i>I know where it's coming from.</i>

28:00.053 --> 28:02.130
Wow.

28:02.222 --> 28:04.464
<i>What the hell was that?</i>

28:04.558 --> 28:05.969
Brownout.

28:06.059 --> 28:08.977
Smells like they're cooking
a goddam cat over there.

28:09.062 --> 28:13.106
- I'm gonna go find out what exactly...
- Get down, get down!

28:34.753 --> 28:37.670
No headlights.

30:12.796 --> 30:15.321
I can see the news report now:

30:15.515 --> 30:19.098
"They were a quiet family.
Kept pretty much to themselves.

30:19.186 --> 30:23.764
No one would have ever
suspected them of foul play."

30:26.860 --> 30:31.770
I've never seen anybody drive
their garbage to the street...

30:31.864 --> 30:33.773
and then bang the hell
out of it with a stick.

30:33.866 --> 30:36.701
I've never seen that.

30:43.375 --> 30:45.949
I say we get a look in
those garbage cans.

30:46.045 --> 30:49.958
Call me overly cautious, but don't
you think that's a bit suspicious?

30:50.048 --> 30:53.464
The three of us going through their garbage at
11:00 at night in the middle of a rainstorm?

30:53.551 --> 30:56.801
Affirmative. That garbage
is going nowhere.

30:56.888 --> 30:59.805
I say we wait 'til first light.
Scope me.

30:59.891 --> 31:02.643
<i>I'm outta here.</i>

31:05.313 --> 31:07.471
Rain delay.

31:07.565 --> 31:10.601
Bummer.

31:19.910 --> 31:25.664
Ray, what was that you were saying the
other day about half-cocked theories?

31:25.749 --> 31:28.667
Ray... sleep tight.

32:36.149 --> 32:38.225
No way Wednesday night.
I'm in a league.

32:38.318 --> 32:42.398
This seminar could change your life,
Vic. The man is a great healer.

32:42.489 --> 32:45.573
And I'm a great bowler. Wednesday night
we're taking on Roselli Plumbing.

32:45.658 --> 32:48.066
You should expose yourself
to this guy, Vic.

32:48.161 --> 32:50.912
He understands
paraphysical forces...

32:50.996 --> 32:55.243
the healing capabilities of crystals
and the laying on of hands.

32:55.334 --> 32:58.288
You wanna try laying on some hands?

32:58.378 --> 33:01.249
Wait! Hold it, garbies! Garbies!

33:01.340 --> 33:04.590
Garbagemen! Hold on a minute!
Wait a sec!

33:04.676 --> 33:08.425
<i>Wait! Wait! Wait!
Hold it! What are you doin'?</i>

33:08.514 --> 33:10.754
- I'm emptying garbage.
- Are you outta your mind?

33:10.848 --> 33:13.304
Give me that!

33:13.393 --> 33:16.844
- Hey, cut that out!
- There's nothing here.

33:16.938 --> 33:19.607
Not a finger, not a nose, nothing!

33:19.690 --> 33:21.932
- Give me that.
- Here you go.

33:22.026 --> 33:25.110
- What are you doin'?
- You asked me to help.

33:25.196 --> 33:27.105
Who you calling?

33:27.198 --> 33:29.518
I'm calling the Delvaneys and
having them open the cottage.

33:29.534 --> 33:32.106
No, Carol. I don't want
to go to the cottage.

33:32.202 --> 33:34.954
Fine. Then Dave and I will go
and you can stay here and spy.

33:35.038 --> 33:36.947
Oh, all right. Okay.

33:37.040 --> 33:40.290
- What? What? Are you sulking now?
- No, go up to the cottage!

33:40.377 --> 33:42.784
Take Dave and go to the cottage.
Leave me to pad around the house.

33:42.879 --> 33:44.955
"Pad around the house"? All you do
is pal around the neighbourhood...

33:45.048 --> 33:47.290
- That's my vacation.
- With those two chuckleheads.

33:47.384 --> 33:49.626
<i>- I am very, very worried about you.
- Why?</i>

33:49.719 --> 33:52.470
<i>- You're acting like...
- What am I acting like, Carol?</i>

33:52.555 --> 33:54.464
- Like a guy who's on vacation!
- Like this!

33:54.557 --> 33:56.466
- This is not someone on vacation!
- See? I sleep late!

33:56.559 --> 33:58.468
- Get a tan then!
- In my pyjamas?

33:58.561 --> 34:00.802
- Fix the barbecue! I don't know!
- Look, look!

34:00.896 --> 34:03.138
You go to the cottage and get a tan!
Take David with you!

34:03.232 --> 34:06.150
I don't care! I'll eat takeout!
I'll do the laundry myself!

34:06.235 --> 34:08.393
I'll vacuum the house!
It'll be spotless!

34:08.487 --> 34:10.478
Art's throwing garbage
all over the street.

34:10.572 --> 34:13.905
Your mom and I are having
a conversation! If you... What?

34:13.992 --> 34:17.989
<i>Get out of the truck! Are you nuts?</i>

34:18.079 --> 34:20.155
Hey, it's gotta be
in here somewhere.

34:20.248 --> 34:22.489
The Supreme Court ruled
that a person's garbage...

34:22.583 --> 34:24.864
- is public domain the minute it hits the kerb.
- Shut up.

34:24.918 --> 34:26.829
Did you guys pick up a Hefty
bag out of that yard...

34:26.920 --> 34:29.377
that was bulky and
probably a little moist?

34:29.466 --> 34:32.668
- What is wrong with these people?
- He has a right to know, Vic.

34:32.760 --> 34:36.342
Don't start up with me. Hey, could you
help me get this guy out of here?

34:36.429 --> 34:38.339
Hey, Art. What's happening?

34:41.351 --> 34:44.851
No! Ray! Ray, come back here!

34:44.938 --> 34:47.061
Just one... I'll be... Yeah.

34:47.149 --> 34:49.355
My taxes pay your salary!

34:49.443 --> 34:51.684
I don't want to hear any
of your bullshit either!

34:51.777 --> 34:53.853
The question here is garbage
and who picks up this mess.

34:53.946 --> 34:56.353
<i>"Who picks up this mess"?</i>

34:56.449 --> 35:00.529
You're gonna pick up the mess
because you are a garbageman.

35:00.620 --> 35:03.027
I pick up garbage in cans,
not from the street!

35:03.122 --> 35:05.198
Ray, there's nothing in here.

35:05.291 --> 35:08.209
<i>We practically checked this whole
truck. They must have switched on us.</i>

35:08.628 --> 35:10.287
<i>- The F.B.I.?
- No, the Klopeks.</i>

35:10.378 --> 35:15.171
Oh, no. Naughty little puppy.

35:17.094 --> 35:21.554
Uncle Markie gets very upset
when you're on his lawn.

35:21.640 --> 35:26.218
Wait a minute. You're all
dirty, and you're shaking.

35:26.311 --> 35:29.727
I wonder if Walter
knows you're outside.

35:29.815 --> 35:31.890
- In the rain?
- Yeah, it was raining.

35:31.982 --> 35:34.390
- There were how many of them?
- Well, uh, three.

35:34.485 --> 35:36.893
And what were they doing?

35:36.987 --> 35:39.063
- They were diggin'.
- Digging! Like grave diggers!

35:39.156 --> 35:41.065
- I told you! They're ghouls!
- No, I didn't say that.

35:41.158 --> 35:42.569
They could have been
digging for anything.

35:42.660 --> 35:44.902
They could have been digging
for night crawlers.

35:44.995 --> 35:48.246
- Night crawlers?
- They're fishermen. They need bait.

35:48.332 --> 35:50.240
- Wake up and smell the coffee!
- Shh.

35:50.333 --> 35:53.916
The kid spotted us last night.
When we were sleeping, he got up.

35:54.003 --> 35:56.921
He went to the garbage can, he
took the body and then he...

35:57.006 --> 36:00.755
He buried him in the backyard.

36:00.844 --> 36:03.798
- Let's get outta here.
- I like this.

36:03.888 --> 36:06.426
I hate cul-de-sacs. There's only one
way out, and the people are weird.

36:06.516 --> 36:09.683
Naked ladies.

36:11.520 --> 36:15.103
Does anyone know if Walter left
a spare key around anywhere?

36:15.190 --> 36:19.899
He must have gone away and
forgot to feed Queenie.

36:21.697 --> 36:25.113
- Walter!
- I hope nothing happened to him.

36:25.200 --> 36:28.450
- I think we should call the police.
- Oh, good plan, Ray.

36:28.537 --> 36:31.453
I think I see something
moving in there.

36:35.543 --> 36:38.295
How did you get in there?

36:38.379 --> 36:43.456
<i>A soldier's way saves
the day. Entrez.</i>

36:43.551 --> 36:46.967
<i>- Good, honey.
- Beautiful.</i>

36:47.055 --> 36:49.462
<i>- Walter?
- What's been going on here?</i>

36:49.557 --> 36:51.798
<i>- This doesn't look good.
- Murder, my friend.</i>

36:51.892 --> 36:54.299
- Murder?
- There are signs of a struggle here.

36:54.394 --> 36:56.802
The TV's still on.
Chairs turned over.

36:56.897 --> 36:59.470
I wouldn't say that's
a sign of a struggle.

36:59.566 --> 37:02.318
I think I should go upstairs
and check this out.

37:02.402 --> 37:04.976
Maybe the guy's upstairs in
a bathtub or something...

37:05.072 --> 37:08.322
cracked his head open,
there's blood everywhere...

37:08.408 --> 37:10.649
Just don't touch anything
up there, all right?

37:10.743 --> 37:13.495
Yes, sir, Mr Peterson.

37:13.579 --> 37:16.497
Let's see if we can
find some dog food.

37:16.582 --> 37:20.331
I don't like this. I don't like
snooping around a neighbour's house.

37:20.419 --> 37:23.337
You mean a dead guy's house?

37:23.422 --> 37:25.830
You wanna take that
out of your pocket?

37:25.925 --> 37:28.676
- You wanna not steal that from Walter's house?
- Hey, what's the difference?

37:28.761 --> 37:31.595
All this junk is gonna end up in
a flea market sooner or later.

37:31.679 --> 37:35.013
<i>He might have left in a hurry
and forgot about the dog.</i>

37:35.100 --> 37:37.507
Okay, stay right here, and
we'll find your dish.

37:37.602 --> 37:40.058
<i>Old people space out sometimes.</i>

37:40.146 --> 37:42.388
Bull's-eye!

37:42.482 --> 37:44.391
What, what, what?

37:44.484 --> 37:46.441
A dead rat! There!

37:46.528 --> 37:49.363
Honey, that's not a rat.

37:49.447 --> 37:51.355
That's Walter's toupee.

37:51.448 --> 37:54.200
Beautiful place to keep a toupee:
On the stove.

37:54.284 --> 37:56.194
I'm starving.

37:56.286 --> 37:59.204
One thing about these old guys:

37:59.289 --> 38:02.374
They don't ever leave the
house without their hair.

38:02.459 --> 38:05.033
No, sir.

38:06.797 --> 38:11.541
Walter left this house
in a big hurry.

38:11.634 --> 38:14.884
<i>Hey, you guys, look!
These cookies are...</i>

38:14.971 --> 38:17.378
<i>- That's great! Everybody out!
- Great, Ricky.</i>

38:17.473 --> 38:19.881
I think we've broken
enough laws for one day.

38:19.976 --> 38:22.052
- Hey, sorry, but we have not looked...
- Let's just get outta here.

38:22.145 --> 38:24.054
It's not against the
law to break cookies.

38:24.147 --> 38:26.056
I can't believe you people
talked me into this.

38:26.149 --> 38:28.936
Why don't we just get out
of our neighbour's house?

38:29.026 --> 38:31.563
"Walter, your dog is at my house.

38:31.653 --> 38:35.236
Your window is broken because
we all thought that..."

38:39.661 --> 38:45.082
"Walter... I have your dog.

38:46.334 --> 38:48.244
Ray."

39:03.976 --> 39:06.099
<i>Mr Klopek!</i>

39:06.187 --> 39:08.096
Mr Klopek, hi. Ray Peterson.

39:08.189 --> 39:10.097
<i>Listen, I was w...</i>

39:19.532 --> 39:23.115
What is this doggy-gram? This just
came for you. It might be important.

39:23.203 --> 39:26.619
Come here. Save some for your
friend. Right there. Go on.

39:26.706 --> 39:29.955
- Honey, have you seen your father?
- I think he's in the basement with Art.

39:30.042 --> 39:32.118
He's playing canasta or something.

39:35.547 --> 39:38.465
Honey?

39:38.550 --> 39:41.124
Ray!

39:41.220 --> 39:45.134
Art, you had a dream you were gonna win
the lottery. You blew $500 on tickets.

39:45.224 --> 39:47.133
<i>I can't believe you're
still bringing that up.</i>

39:47.226 --> 39:49.976
You had a dream a plane was gonna crash,
so you took the bus to Las Vegas.

39:50.061 --> 39:52.137
If I had been on the plane,
it would have crashed.

39:52.230 --> 39:54.803
This wasn't a dream.
This was a vision.

39:54.899 --> 39:56.808
These people are Satanists.
They are Satanists.

39:56.901 --> 39:58.312
This is all gibberish.

39:58.403 --> 40:00.976
Look, the world is full of these
kind of things. Look at this.

40:01.072 --> 40:04.275
Black masses, mutilations.
Mutilations!

40:04.367 --> 40:09.278
The incubus, the succubus. I'm telling
you, Walter was a human sacrifice.

40:09.372 --> 40:11.992
I should have gone to the lake.

40:12.082 --> 40:14.158
I should have listened to Carol.

40:14.251 --> 40:17.999
Listen to your wife? Who listens to
their wife? You gotta listen to me.

40:18.088 --> 40:21.504
We gotta go down to the
religious supply store.

40:21.591 --> 40:23.667
We gotta get ourselves a couple
of gallons of holy water.

40:23.760 --> 40:26.002
My cousin is a priest.
He can get us a deal.

40:26.096 --> 40:28.338
- Then we gotta go to the market.
- I don't want to hear this.

40:28.432 --> 40:32.511
- We gotta get big strings of garlic.
- I'm not gonna listen.

40:32.601 --> 40:36.101
- We gotta get some fresh lamb's blood.
- I'm not going to hear this.

40:36.188 --> 40:38.181
Ray, do you want 'em to take
your family, kidnap 'em...

40:38.274 --> 40:40.847
tear their livers out and
make some satanic pate?

40:40.943 --> 40:43.516
I'm not going to hear this.
I'm not going to listen.

40:43.612 --> 40:46.863
Ray, you're chanting. Ray.

40:46.949 --> 40:51.112
Ray, look. Ray. Unconscious
chanting. You're chanting.

40:51.202 --> 40:53.693
I want to kill everyone.

40:53.788 --> 40:56.623
Satan is good. Satan is our pal.

40:56.708 --> 41:01.037
Ray, Ray, you're chanting. Hey.

41:01.129 --> 41:06.372
Once they get in here,
it's over, pal.

41:08.595 --> 41:11.049
Satanists, huh?

41:11.138 --> 41:13.973
Ritual killers?

41:14.058 --> 41:17.723
Nice. Very, very nice.

41:17.811 --> 41:19.887
So let me get this straight.

41:19.980 --> 41:25.769
The Klopeks are offering up Walter
as a human sacrifice to Beelzebub?

41:25.861 --> 41:28.067
That's one of the theories. Yeah.

41:28.155 --> 41:32.234
Mm-hmm. Great, great.

41:32.325 --> 41:36.073
So this is your relaxing
week at home, huh?

41:36.162 --> 41:38.570
I wouldn't have missed
this for the world.

41:38.664 --> 41:41.535
- A week in Jonestown.
- Where are you going?

41:41.626 --> 41:43.535
To the bathroom.

41:43.628 --> 41:45.953
Relax.

42:11.320 --> 42:14.606
What is it?

42:29.879 --> 42:34.422
<i>Shut it off! No!</i>

43:04.747 --> 43:06.656
Carol?

43:17.258 --> 43:19.334
Carol?

43:24.265 --> 43:26.174
Carol?

43:49.456 --> 43:51.364
<i>Ray.</i>

43:51.457 --> 43:54.707
Ray.

43:54.794 --> 44:00.380
It was so nice of you to invite the
new neighbours over for a barbecue.

44:08.641 --> 44:10.882
Ow.

44:13.812 --> 44:16.053
<i>Satan is good. Satan is our pal.</i>

44:16.147 --> 44:18.555
<i>I want to kill everyone.</i>

44:18.650 --> 44:21.022
<i>Satan is good.
Satan is our pal.</i>

44:31.453 --> 44:34.371
<i>Oh, Ray Peterson...</i>

44:34.456 --> 44:36.365
<i>whatever you do...</i>

44:36.458 --> 44:39.329
don't let them do to you...

44:39.420 --> 44:42.255
what they did to me.

44:42.339 --> 44:44.498
Ooh, I bet that hurts, huh?

44:53.850 --> 44:55.759
Hey, hey, hey!

44:55.852 --> 44:59.102
Who the heck ordered
the blood shake?

44:59.188 --> 45:03.435
Hey, Ray. It's not Skip. It's me, Art.
I'm just pretending to be Skip.

45:03.526 --> 45:05.934
You didn't happen to see an ice
pick around here, did you?

45:08.156 --> 45:11.606
<i>Mind your own business.</i>

45:11.700 --> 45:15.780
Mind your own business!

45:15.871 --> 45:18.948
Okay!

45:21.209 --> 45:23.783
It's a beautiful day
in this neighbourhood

45:23.879 --> 45:26.286
It's a beautiful day
for a neighbour

45:26.381 --> 45:30.129
Would you be mine
Could you be mine

45:30.217 --> 45:32.625
<i>It's a neighbourly day
in this beauty wood</i>

45:32.720 --> 45:34.962
<i>A neighbourly day for a beauty</i>

45:35.056 --> 45:39.136
<i>Would you be mine
Could you be mine</i>

45:39.226 --> 45:42.311
<i>I have always wanted
to have a neighbour</i>

45:42.396 --> 45:44.305
<i>Just like you</i>

45:44.398 --> 45:46.307
<i>I've always wanted to live</i>

45:46.400 --> 45:49.650
<i>In the neighbourhood with you</i>

45:49.737 --> 45:55.323
<i>So let's make the most
of this beautiful day</i>

45:55.408 --> 45:58.991
<i>Since we're together
I might as well say</i>

45:59.079 --> 46:01.652
<i>Would you be mine
Could you be mine</i>

46:01.748 --> 46:04.998
<i>Won't you be my neighbour</i>

46:05.085 --> 46:09.663
<i>Won't you please
Won't you please</i>

46:09.756 --> 46:13.669
<i>Please, won't you be my neighbour</i>

46:13.759 --> 46:17.970
Hey, Ray!
Ray, we got a plan! Come on.

46:18.055 --> 46:22.266
We got a plan. Come on. We got...

46:22.351 --> 46:25.601
Sorry, boys. My husband's not feeling
well. He has to stay in his room.

46:25.688 --> 46:28.013
- Ooh, he was bad.
- Come on.

46:28.107 --> 46:30.063
Please, Carol, let him come out.

46:30.149 --> 46:32.687
<i>Come on.</i>

46:32.777 --> 46:36.027
He can't come out until he
resembles the man that I married.

46:36.114 --> 46:39.732
- We don't have that kind of time.
- Please let him come out.

46:39.826 --> 46:43.076
I think that I have
given you my answer.

47:06.143 --> 47:11.219
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
The bees came from there.

47:11.313 --> 47:14.896
- Watch this hole.
- Okay, let's try the side door.

47:29.331 --> 47:31.407
Okay, do it.

47:31.499 --> 47:36.078
Do what? We agreed
to do it together.

48:08.035 --> 48:10.110
Ray. Ray.

48:10.203 --> 48:12.112
I'm only trying to take a nap.

48:12.205 --> 48:14.114
I'm only laying here
with my eyes closed...

48:14.207 --> 48:16.116
trying to get some goddam sleep.

48:16.209 --> 48:18.451
Quiet, quiet, quiet. I wouldn't
wake you if it wasn't important.

48:18.544 --> 48:20.454
- I think we flushed 'em out.
- Okay.

48:20.546 --> 48:21.957
The Klopeks.

48:22.048 --> 48:24.455
- Rumsfield and I, we flushed 'em out.
- How?

48:24.550 --> 48:26.626
We wrote a note. We slipped
it under their door.

48:26.719 --> 48:28.795
- We rang the bell, and then we ran.
- You did that?

48:28.888 --> 48:32.303
- Yeah.
- Oh, geez! Stupid idi...

48:32.391 --> 48:34.300
I can't believe you...

48:37.396 --> 48:40.313
All I did was write,
"I know what you've done."

48:40.399 --> 48:43.649
- I didn't sign it or anything.
- Oh, I can't... You stupid...

48:43.735 --> 48:47.151
- Why didn't you... God!
- You gotta goose these people.

48:47.239 --> 48:50.820
You gotta give them a little shot,
let 'em know that you're there.

48:50.908 --> 48:53.150
Good dog, Vince. Go get it.

48:53.244 --> 48:56.161
Here's the thing, Art.
They're gonna think I did it.

48:56.247 --> 48:58.654
- Why?
- The old guy saw me write a note...

48:58.749 --> 49:00.658
and put it under Walter's door.

49:00.751 --> 49:03.325
So they're gonna
think that I did it!

49:03.421 --> 49:06.920
You wrote a note and put it
under the... I didn't know that.

49:07.007 --> 49:09.712
<i>It doesn't matter 'cause
we got 'em on the run now.</i>

49:09.802 --> 49:11.710
Now they know that we know
that they know that we know!

49:11.803 --> 49:15.587
Yes, it does matter! You did it,
but they're gonna suspect me!

49:15.682 --> 49:18.007
They're not gonna
suspect anybody. They're...

49:27.277 --> 49:30.692
- Do you know what this is?
- It's a bone.

49:30.779 --> 49:35.026
- It's a femur.
- It's a femur bone.

49:36.618 --> 49:42.039
A femur just happens to be
a human thigh bone, Ray.

49:42.124 --> 49:45.707
- Wait, how do you know that?
- Biology 101.

49:45.794 --> 49:49.044
Look at the size of this thing.

49:49.131 --> 49:51.538
Think this came off a
chicken or something?

49:51.632 --> 49:54.040
Where the hell did Vince get this?

50:00.141 --> 50:03.095
<i>He dug it up from
underneath the fence.</i>

50:06.939 --> 50:11.850
Ray. Ray, there's
no doubt any more.

50:11.943 --> 50:15.727
This is real. Your neighbours
are murdering people.

50:15.822 --> 50:20.568
They're chopping 'em up.
They're burying 'em in their backyard.

50:22.579 --> 50:25.248
Ray, this is Walter.

50:25.332 --> 50:29.085
No!

50:44.809 --> 50:47.478
There's just got to be some
other explanation for this.

50:51.606 --> 50:54.940
It's just some litter.
The guy's a litterbug.

50:56.778 --> 51:01.606
<i>It could be a candy bar wrapper.
It could be a napkin.</i>

51:01.700 --> 51:03.609
It could be a crumpled
up credit card receipt.

51:03.702 --> 51:06.157
Those things blow
around all the time.

51:06.246 --> 51:08.653
It, uh... No, it's my note.

51:12.042 --> 51:14.996
- Oh! Oh, I'm sorry.
- Ouch!

51:15.087 --> 51:18.372
I didn't see you. I didn't see you.

51:20.050 --> 51:23.799
Great. Crush a beer can.
You feel better now?

51:24.304 --> 51:26.795
<i>Well...</i>

51:26.890 --> 51:30.472
I think it's time we all stopped
acting like kindergartners.

51:30.560 --> 51:34.807
- Don't you, Ray?
- Yes, Carol.

51:34.897 --> 51:39.109
Now, before somebody falls off a
roof or sets themselves on fire...

51:39.193 --> 51:41.103
I think we should go over
there, knock on their door...

51:41.195 --> 51:43.153
and invite ourselves in for
a nice, neighbourly chat.

51:43.239 --> 51:47.486
<i>Get to know these people like we
should have done a month ago.</i>

51:47.577 --> 51:50.696
That's a good idea.
I'll make brownies.

51:50.787 --> 51:55.366
- Great. While you keep 'em busy, I...
- You're not invited.

52:16.645 --> 52:19.183
- Can't we do this tomorrow, Carol?
- Would you relax?

52:19.273 --> 52:22.191
We'll probably find out more in
five minutes of friendly chat...

52:22.276 --> 52:25.977
than you guys can in a
month of snooping around.

52:31.785 --> 52:36.032
Okay, now, everybody
just act normal.

52:42.796 --> 52:45.037
- Who is it?
- Yoo-hoo!

52:45.131 --> 52:48.085
It's Carol Peterson from next door.

52:49.469 --> 52:52.041
Oh!

52:52.137 --> 52:55.091
There go the goddam brownies.

52:58.143 --> 53:03.054
Hi. Welcome to Mayfield Place.
We're your neighbours.

53:03.148 --> 53:05.224
We brought dessert...

53:07.653 --> 53:10.569
Uh, is your mother home?

53:10.655 --> 53:15.068
Here you go, sonny. A little
something for the sweet tooth.

53:29.173 --> 53:31.545
I can't believe you've lived
here a whole month...

53:31.633 --> 53:34.338
and we haven't come
by to say hello.

53:35.971 --> 53:39.719
I'm your neighbour, Ray Peterson.
That's my wife, Carol.

53:39.808 --> 53:42.216
That's Bonnie, and this is, uh...

53:42.310 --> 53:44.718
Rumsfield's the name.

53:44.813 --> 53:47.386
Don't think I caught yours, sonny.

53:47.482 --> 53:49.558
- Hans.
- Hans.

53:49.651 --> 53:54.063
A fine, Christian name.
Hans Christian Andersen.

53:54.155 --> 53:56.112
What, are you Catholic?

53:56.198 --> 53:58.238
I don't know.

54:00.828 --> 54:04.411
Oh. Pretty girl.

54:04.498 --> 54:08.247
- Friend of yours?
- No, it came with the frame.

54:08.336 --> 54:10.707
- "It came with the frame"?
- Yes.

54:10.795 --> 54:15.753
Oh, is this the dining room?
Oh! You startled me.

54:15.842 --> 54:19.591
- My Uncle Reuben.
- How do you do?

54:23.516 --> 54:28.095
You are the one who
lives next door.

54:28.188 --> 54:32.765
<i>- Um... why don't we get some coffee?
- I'll do it.</i>

54:32.858 --> 54:37.354
What do you say we all sit down for
a little face-to-face, eh, Reub?

54:37.446 --> 54:41.111
They're in there, all right.
They're just standing around.

54:41.200 --> 54:45.778
Oh, great. Don't worry,
you guys. I can get this.

54:45.871 --> 54:49.454
- I really appreciate your help. Really.
- No problem. Just be careful.

54:49.541 --> 54:51.948
It's pretty dangerous
with the trip wire.

54:52.043 --> 54:53.952
Thanks for your advice.

54:54.045 --> 54:55.954
<i>- W-Watch!
- Be careful!</i>

54:56.047 --> 54:59.747
<i>- I'm watchin'.
- Did you make it?</i>

55:03.388 --> 55:06.472
I'm all right. I'm okay, I'm okay.

55:06.557 --> 55:11.135
Just throw me the tools.

55:11.228 --> 55:14.264
<i>Ow!</i>

55:55.687 --> 55:58.723
Sure was damp today.

55:58.815 --> 56:02.729
<i>Yes, I just can't seem to
do anything with my hair.</i>

56:23.130 --> 56:25.123
A sardine?

56:27.634 --> 56:30.469
I'm trying to cut back.

56:30.553 --> 56:33.044
<i>Sardine?</i>

57:25.898 --> 57:28.982
Um...

57:29.068 --> 57:31.819
So, how are you
enjoying Hinkley Hills?

57:31.903 --> 57:34.476
We just love it.

57:34.572 --> 57:37.408
- Don't we?
- Yes.

57:37.492 --> 57:40.742
Klopek. What is that, Slavic?

57:43.081 --> 57:46.165
No!

57:46.251 --> 57:50.330
About a nine on the
tension scale, Reub.

57:50.421 --> 57:52.828
How do you like living here so far?

57:52.923 --> 57:55.331
Pretty comfortable house, ain't it?

57:55.426 --> 57:58.510
Good, solid walls.

57:58.595 --> 58:02.178
Good, solid floors.

58:10.732 --> 58:13.353
Got somebody tied up in the
old cellar, have you, Reub?

58:34.129 --> 58:36.798
It's packing dust. I'm sorry.

58:36.882 --> 58:39.289
<i>So...</i>

58:39.384 --> 58:42.718
Just you and Unc living here in
the house, is that it, sonny?

58:42.804 --> 58:46.553
- No...
- Please, this is a small family:

58:46.641 --> 58:50.056
Me, the young boy...

58:50.144 --> 58:54.723
and my brother... the doctor.

58:54.815 --> 58:58.564
<i>Won't it be nice to have a
doctor in the neighbourhood?</i>

59:01.989 --> 59:07.410
You know, I think it's great you've been
able to stay with all the original wood.

59:07.495 --> 59:10.245
I was never over here when
the Knapps lived here.

59:10.330 --> 59:14.244
How unfortunate for the Knapps.

59:14.334 --> 59:20.088
You know, it's funny, but I don't
remember seeing a moving van out front.

59:20.173 --> 59:25.049
<i>I don't understand that.
It was parked outside all day!</i>

59:25.387 --> 59:29.254
<i>- Really?
- S-Say, how is, uh...</i>

59:29.349 --> 59:33.761
the... drainage on
your property here?

59:33.852 --> 59:36.094
I know when it rains
at our house...

59:36.188 --> 59:40.435
boy, the basement
just floods right over.

59:40.526 --> 59:44.773
Basement? Ray comes up
with a winning idea.

59:44.863 --> 59:47.022
Maybe we should go take
a look in the basement.

59:47.116 --> 59:49.025
<i>Maybe that was brother
down there...</i>

59:49.118 --> 59:51.109
tapping on the ceiling
a couple minutes ago.

59:51.202 --> 59:53.111
Who knows?

59:56.541 --> 59:59.458
Just what kind of doctor
is this brother of yours?

01:00:00.044 --> 01:00:03.260
Why don't you ask him yourself?

01:00:38.080 --> 01:00:41.330
Ah, we have guests.

01:00:41.417 --> 01:00:43.659
Sort of.

01:00:43.753 --> 01:00:47.003
My brother, the doctor.

01:00:49.091 --> 01:00:50.999
Werner Klopek.

01:00:51.092 --> 01:00:53.334
How nice to meet you.

01:00:53.428 --> 01:00:55.337
Ray Peterson.

01:00:55.430 --> 01:00:59.013
Oh, pardon my glove.

01:01:47.480 --> 01:01:51.559
I thought the candles would
be romantic... for the ladies.

01:01:51.650 --> 01:01:53.892
- Oh.
- They're lovely.

01:01:53.986 --> 01:01:56.737
I really must apologize
for the paint.

01:01:56.822 --> 01:02:00.072
I was just touching up
one of my pictures.

01:02:00.158 --> 01:02:04.405
<i>I find painting relaxes me.</i>

01:02:13.838 --> 01:02:17.420
- Sugar substitute?
- No, thank you.

01:02:17.508 --> 01:02:23.095
<i>It was impolite of us not to have
introduced ourselves sooner.</i>

01:02:23.180 --> 01:02:26.845
<i>I find my work is rather solitary.</i>

01:02:26.934 --> 01:02:30.931
It always keeps us on the move.

01:02:31.021 --> 01:02:35.433
Did you know we've had to move
four times in as many years?

01:02:35.525 --> 01:02:41.112
<i>Oh, all that moving must
be very hard on you, Hans.</i>

01:02:41.197 --> 01:02:44.613
Indeed. And tomorrow...

01:02:44.701 --> 01:02:47.618
Tomorrow we must all go
to the university...

01:02:47.704 --> 01:02:50.953
to discuss yet another transfer.

01:02:51.040 --> 01:02:53.531
No. And we're just
getting to know you.

01:02:53.625 --> 01:02:56.295
That's a shame.
Isn't that a shame, honey?

01:02:56.378 --> 01:02:57.837
That's a shame.

01:02:57.921 --> 01:03:00.128
Says who?

01:03:02.217 --> 01:03:04.625
And I was just remarking...

01:03:04.720 --> 01:03:08.303
to Hans... today...

01:03:08.390 --> 01:03:11.639
how nice it would be...

01:03:11.726 --> 01:03:14.134
to meet all of our
new neighbours...

01:03:14.228 --> 01:03:17.479
<i>and here you are.</i>

01:03:17.565 --> 01:03:20.899
<i>- Actually, we're not all here.
- Oh?</i>

01:03:20.985 --> 01:03:26.276
Walter, the old man next door.
We don't know where the hell he is.

01:03:26.366 --> 01:03:28.275
Oh, God! Jesus Christ!

01:03:28.368 --> 01:03:32.234
Sorry! Sorry! Ow!

01:03:32.329 --> 01:03:35.496
Terrible thing, the
plight of the elderly.

01:03:35.582 --> 01:03:37.491
We were just remarking
the other day...

01:03:37.584 --> 01:03:39.493
about how an old guy like that...

01:03:39.586 --> 01:03:41.994
could just drop off the face
of the Earth without a sign.

01:03:42.089 --> 01:03:45.339
Vanish. No one ever see him
again. No trace. Nothing.

01:03:45.425 --> 01:03:48.296
Right, Ray? Yesterday, wasn't it?

01:03:48.387 --> 01:03:50.295
<i>We were just talking
about it yesterday.</i>

01:03:50.388 --> 01:03:54.255
I bet you were.

01:03:54.350 --> 01:03:58.846
<i>Why don't we just cut all
this polite crap, all right?</i>

01:03:58.938 --> 01:04:02.022
What's the weird goddam noise you
got comin' outta here all the time?

01:04:02.108 --> 01:04:03.602
Uh, I think we should go...

01:04:03.693 --> 01:04:05.851
What have you got in the
cellar, Herr Klopek?

01:04:05.945 --> 01:04:09.361
<i>- Mark!
- Ray.</i>

01:04:09.448 --> 01:04:12.697
<i>Come on. Tell him
what you saw. Tell him.</i>

01:04:12.784 --> 01:04:14.693
I have to use your bathroom.

01:04:14.786 --> 01:04:17.194
Ray, remember night before last?

01:04:17.288 --> 01:04:19.365
- You said they were digging.
- Don't open that!

01:04:19.457 --> 01:04:21.616
<i>Ray!</i>

01:04:21.710 --> 01:04:23.418
Oh! Oh!

01:04:27.298 --> 01:04:29.457
You keep a horse in the basement?

01:04:47.609 --> 01:04:51.558
- Is it a burglar?
- No, it's Art.

01:04:51.654 --> 01:04:55.237
<i>Another neighbour?</i>

01:04:55.325 --> 01:04:57.401
A fat one.

01:04:58.995 --> 01:05:01.320
Go on, you mangy mutt!

01:05:02.915 --> 01:05:07.743
<i>I'm sorry if Landru frightened you.</i>

01:05:07.837 --> 01:05:11.585
<i>- His size tends to overwhelm people.
- Oh, no, no.</i>

01:05:11.673 --> 01:05:15.089
We've imposed on you enough for one
evening. It's been lovely meeting you.

01:05:15.177 --> 01:05:17.419
<i>- See you, Doc. Later, Reub.
- Bye, Hans.</i>

01:05:17.512 --> 01:05:21.261
Yes, Doctor. It's been real.

01:05:21.350 --> 01:05:23.591
- Are you all right?
- Yes, I'm fine.

01:05:23.685 --> 01:05:26.888
Let's do this again
sometime... real soon.

01:05:26.980 --> 01:05:30.929
<i>- We'll see ourselves to the door. Honey?
- Goodnight.</i>

01:05:36.030 --> 01:05:38.438
<i>Okay, I admit it.
They're slightly eccentric.</i>

01:05:38.532 --> 01:05:40.442
<i>"Slightly eccentric"? Carol...</i>

01:05:40.534 --> 01:05:42.610
<i>- But that doesn't mean...
- Come on!</i>

01:05:42.703 --> 01:05:45.870
<i>- They chopped Walter into little pieces!
- These people are clearly psychos!</i>

01:05:47.375 --> 01:05:50.291
Ray, what do you think?

01:05:50.377 --> 01:05:55.288
Yeah, what do you think?

01:05:55.382 --> 01:05:59.130
Right. Been awfully quiet, Ray.

01:05:59.219 --> 01:06:02.967
Maybe we could have a
little participation here.

01:06:03.056 --> 01:06:07.469
I think they're clean. I think
Bonnie and Carol are right.

01:06:07.560 --> 01:06:09.802
<i>- See?
- That's great, Ray.</i>

01:06:09.895 --> 01:06:12.469
Just pull open the door, pull the
rip cord and bail out on us.

01:06:12.564 --> 01:06:15.316
That's rich, considering you're the
one who started this whole thing.

01:06:15.401 --> 01:06:17.477
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Who started it, tuna neck?

01:06:17.569 --> 01:06:19.479
- "Tuna neck"?
- You instigated this whole damn thing!

01:06:19.571 --> 01:06:21.481
You know who instigated this? Your boy
watching people dig in the backyard!

01:06:21.573 --> 01:06:24.989
- You leave my...
- Honey, would you and Bonnie excuse us?

01:06:25.077 --> 01:06:29.490
I think I should have a talk with the
boys in the den for a few minutes.

01:06:29.581 --> 01:06:32.154
- Okay.
- Oh.

01:06:32.250 --> 01:06:35.002
It's good to see you've come
to your senses, sweetie.

01:06:36.421 --> 01:06:38.828
Just a minute or two.

01:06:52.769 --> 01:06:54.845
So, what's the deal, Ray?

01:06:54.938 --> 01:06:58.806
Are you siding with the chicks
against us? Is that it?

01:06:58.900 --> 01:07:02.352
Yeah, are you totally
pussy-whipped or what?

01:07:02.446 --> 01:07:04.687
Just take your balls out
of your wife's purse.

01:07:04.781 --> 01:07:07.023
Make a stand for one
time in your life.

01:07:07.117 --> 01:07:10.033
Hey, Ray, come on.

01:07:10.119 --> 01:07:12.871
- It's just a figure of speech.
- It's a joke. He's kiddin' around.

01:07:12.955 --> 01:07:15.197
<i>Oh, it's Walter's rug.</i>

01:07:15.291 --> 01:07:18.161
<i>You got an old guy's wig.
Big deal.</i>

01:07:18.252 --> 01:07:21.206
You've had that in
your trousers all day?

01:07:21.297 --> 01:07:26.540
After you found this in
Walter's house yesterday...

01:07:26.636 --> 01:07:31.047
I slipped it back in
through the mail slot.

01:07:31.139 --> 01:07:34.888
- Yeah?
- Where did you get it this time?

01:07:37.812 --> 01:07:39.888
Klopeks? Wow.

01:07:39.981 --> 01:07:42.733
After the dog came up
out of the basement.

01:07:42.817 --> 01:07:44.893
I found it wedged between
a bunch of magazines...

01:07:44.986 --> 01:07:48.236
all of which were
addressed to Walter.

01:07:48.323 --> 01:07:51.905
Then that means that...

01:07:51.992 --> 01:07:56.903
Klopeks went back inside
Walter's house...

01:07:56.997 --> 01:07:59.405
and got the hair.

01:08:04.171 --> 01:08:07.089
What do we do now, soldier?

01:08:07.174 --> 01:08:10.589
You heard them say they
were going away tomorrow.

01:08:10.677 --> 01:08:12.005
Yeah.

01:08:12.095 --> 01:08:14.420
As soon as that car
leaves in the morning...

01:08:14.514 --> 01:08:19.508
I'm going over the fence and I'm not
comin' back 'til I find a dead body.

01:08:21.187 --> 01:08:25.600
Nobody knocks off an old man in my
neighbourhood and gets away with it.

01:09:21.411 --> 01:09:26.488
Gentlemen, we are on alert.

01:09:26.582 --> 01:09:28.492
Honey, you know what you could do?

01:09:28.585 --> 01:09:32.202
Go get those flag stones at the garden
centre and put them along the walk.

01:09:32.296 --> 01:09:34.170
Yeah, that'd be a nice project.

01:09:34.256 --> 01:09:37.839
I've got a foursome lined up with Art
today in an hour and a half though.

01:09:37.926 --> 01:09:40.678
I didn't mean right now.
You hate golf.

01:09:40.763 --> 01:09:43.846
Well, it's my vacation. I just
wanted to get out of the house.

01:09:43.932 --> 01:09:46.009
I would think, after the week I put
you through, you'd want to too.

01:09:46.100 --> 01:09:49.849
Why do I get the impression
you're trying to get rid of me?

01:09:49.937 --> 01:09:53.270
I'm gonna be gone all day. It'd be a
good time for you to go see Evelyn.

01:09:53.358 --> 01:09:55.516
And you have a good
time with the cousins.

01:09:55.610 --> 01:09:59.275
I hate them, Dad. Rudy is a
moron, and Diane smells.

01:09:59.364 --> 01:10:01.855
Have a nice weekend.

01:10:03.284 --> 01:10:06.036
I'll see you later.

01:10:09.457 --> 01:10:11.864
<i>Hey, Carol, see my new golf glove?</i>

01:10:11.959 --> 01:10:14.035
I got it so I don't get
blisters playing golf.

01:10:14.127 --> 01:10:16.369
We're gonna be playing
that much golf. Really.

01:10:17.631 --> 01:10:19.873
Fore!

01:10:19.967 --> 01:10:22.043
Think she bought it?

01:10:32.770 --> 01:10:36.637
Yo, Steve-man.
What's the haps, dude?

01:10:36.732 --> 01:10:39.899
You gotta come down here today.
It's gonna be live.

01:10:39.986 --> 01:10:42.062
No, you've got to.

01:10:42.154 --> 01:10:45.404
Something's about to
happen. I can't tell you.

01:10:51.830 --> 01:10:53.739
Are you sure you know
what you're doing, Art?

01:10:53.832 --> 01:10:55.908
There's a lot of juice
going through those wires.

01:10:56.001 --> 01:10:58.077
You hit the wrong one,
you're a Post Toastie.

01:10:58.169 --> 01:11:00.328
Electricity is our friend.

01:11:00.422 --> 01:11:02.382
Besides, we wanna take out
their alarms, don't we?

01:11:02.424 --> 01:11:06.421
I was thinking we could bypass the fence
altogether and find another way in.

01:11:06.511 --> 01:11:08.919
No one knows how many trip
alarms they have in there.

01:11:09.014 --> 01:11:12.595
No, I can take out everything they've
got with one clip of the snips.

01:11:12.683 --> 01:11:14.759
- Right, Captain?
- Affirmative.

01:11:17.521 --> 01:11:19.597
Siren mode.

01:11:19.690 --> 01:11:22.607
Pretty neat, eh?

01:11:22.693 --> 01:11:25.101
I can raise all the
police channels...

01:11:25.195 --> 01:11:28.362
and the power company
channels on this baby.

01:11:28.449 --> 01:11:30.606
<i>- Be careful up there, Art.
- It's okay, Ray.</i>

01:11:30.700 --> 01:11:33.784
We gotta get going though.
We're burning daylight here.

01:11:36.873 --> 01:11:40.787
Hey, where should we start
diggin' once we get over there?

01:11:40.877 --> 01:11:44.791
We start in the backyard,
then check the basement.

01:11:44.881 --> 01:11:47.004
Be careful up there. Go slow, huh?

01:11:47.091 --> 01:11:50.340
Hey, safety is my middle name.

01:11:51.386 --> 01:11:54.304
I thought his middle
name was Louis.

01:11:55.891 --> 01:11:58.464
<i>Are you sure you're
all right up there?</i>

01:11:58.560 --> 01:12:00.517
I don't know that he
knows what he's doing.

01:12:00.604 --> 01:12:04.981
- Well, why didn't you go up there?
- It's very high.

01:12:13.824 --> 01:12:17.407
Oh, Jesus!

01:12:19.413 --> 01:12:22.782
Jesus Christ! Get an
ambulance on that thing!

01:12:25.711 --> 01:12:28.629
I'm okay. I'm all right.

01:12:28.714 --> 01:12:32.758
Ow! God!

01:12:32.842 --> 01:12:34.752
I took a jolt, but I'm okay.

01:12:34.844 --> 01:12:36.754
- Can you stand up?
- Oh, yeah.

01:12:36.846 --> 01:12:40.262
- Try one of these.
- Oh, yeah, that's better.

01:12:40.350 --> 01:12:42.758
- Whoa, whoa.
- No, no, no. Jesus.

01:12:42.852 --> 01:12:46.518
Look at my fingers.

01:12:46.606 --> 01:12:50.603
My fingernails are black.

01:12:50.693 --> 01:12:53.362
- My fillings are hot.
- Hey, look at this.

01:12:53.445 --> 01:12:57.194
The man actually hit the
right wire. There's no alarm.

01:12:57.283 --> 01:13:00.865
- Hey, good work.
- Congratulations. Now give me five.

01:13:00.953 --> 01:13:04.536
- I'm gonna set up a communications base.
- You got it.

01:13:04.623 --> 01:13:08.288
- Here, you're gonna need this.
- Here.

01:13:32.899 --> 01:13:35.355
Hey, hey, hey, Rumsfield! Dude!

01:13:35.444 --> 01:13:37.483
What are you doing with the gun?

01:13:37.571 --> 01:13:40.406
Just shut up and paint
your goddam house!

01:13:40.490 --> 01:13:44.322
Whoa! Fine.

01:13:49.708 --> 01:13:53.076
Task Force One, this is Eagle Eye.

01:13:53.169 --> 01:13:56.538
You are all clear.

01:13:58.049 --> 01:14:00.337
Roger, Eagle Eye. We're going over.

01:14:00.426 --> 01:14:05.800
Roger. Red rover, red
rover, let Ray go over.

01:14:08.017 --> 01:14:12.345
Good. Now, red rover, red
rover, let Art go on over.

01:14:16.733 --> 01:14:19.141
That's great. Over.

01:14:25.367 --> 01:14:28.237
It's really getting hot out here.

01:14:28.328 --> 01:14:31.244
Yeah. Yeah, it is getting hot, Art.

01:14:31.330 --> 01:14:35.624
Why don't you dig one
of your own holes, huh?

01:14:35.709 --> 01:14:39.458
I was just checking this one. Besides,
the radio... I was monitoring...

01:14:39.546 --> 01:14:43.758
This is turning out to be a lot more
work than we thought it was gonna be.

01:14:43.842 --> 01:14:47.710
Why don't we check the house?
It's probably a lot cooler in there.

01:14:47.805 --> 01:14:50.425
That's a good idea.
Let's try the house.

01:14:50.515 --> 01:14:53.184
We'll start in the basement.

01:14:53.268 --> 01:14:57.597
We'll start in the basement
and just work our way up.

01:14:57.689 --> 01:15:00.808
<i>Ray, I'm thinking the reason we didn't
find anything in the backyard...</i>

01:15:00.900 --> 01:15:03.460
<i>is because they probably weren't
burying anybody in the backyard.</i>

01:15:03.528 --> 01:15:07.228
<i>They were digging bodies up and they
probably buried them in the basement.</i>

01:15:07.323 --> 01:15:09.565
<i>That's a possibility, Art.</i>

01:15:09.659 --> 01:15:13.406
<i>I say we start in the kitchen. They
probably got some cold beer in there.</i>

01:15:13.495 --> 01:15:17.078
<i>Or some knockwurst or
something. I'm starving.</i>

01:15:17.165 --> 01:15:20.083
It's locked.

01:15:20.168 --> 01:15:22.375
- Hey, give me a credit card.
- Yeah.

01:15:40.146 --> 01:15:44.938
- Where did you learn how to do that?
- I don't know how to do this.

01:15:48.279 --> 01:15:50.899
Ah, it's a shit store anyway.

01:15:55.952 --> 01:16:00.116
Ray, do the words "breaking and
entering" mean anything to you?

01:16:01.374 --> 01:16:07.247
<i>Hey, Mr Rumsfield!
Hey, yo, man!</i>

01:16:07.339 --> 01:16:09.248
I wanted to introduce
you to my friend.

01:16:09.341 --> 01:16:12.590
- This is Steve Kuntz.
- Hey, dude.

01:16:12.676 --> 01:16:14.799
He's here to watch the
show this afternoon.

01:16:14.887 --> 01:16:16.796
Great.

01:16:57.844 --> 01:17:00.217
<i>It's about time, you guys.</i>

01:17:00.305 --> 01:17:03.555
Hey, man, when's the
big unveiling, huh?

01:17:03.642 --> 01:17:09.348
- I gotta go to work in a couple hours.
- Hey, man, piss off!

01:17:09.439 --> 01:17:12.854
<i>- Get this lame-o out of your yard!
- Yo!</i>

01:17:12.942 --> 01:17:15.943
- Get out of my yard, lame-o! Hey!
- What's his problem?

01:17:16.028 --> 01:17:18.187
<i>Get out of my yard!</i>

01:17:25.746 --> 01:17:28.368
<i>Ray, look at the size
of this furnace.</i>

01:17:28.457 --> 01:17:30.947
This thing's got to
be 80 years old.

01:17:31.042 --> 01:17:33.616
These old places have
got to be hell to heat.

01:17:33.712 --> 01:17:35.455
<i>This house isn't that big.</i>

01:17:35.547 --> 01:17:39.710
What the hell does he need
a furnace like this for?

01:17:41.678 --> 01:17:45.177
I think there's been some modifications
on this 'cause this conduit's brand new.

01:17:45.265 --> 01:17:47.886
It runs all the way back over there
and up through a hole in the ceiling.

01:17:47.976 --> 01:17:50.466
I saw some of that in
their living room.

01:17:50.561 --> 01:17:53.230
And a thermostat on
a home furnace...

01:17:53.314 --> 01:17:56.018
Is that supposed to go to
5,000 degrees, do you think?

01:17:56.108 --> 01:17:57.982
It must be what all the noise was.

01:17:58.068 --> 01:18:00.028
Look at all the stuff they
put together down here.

01:18:00.070 --> 01:18:03.155
- They got this place wired with batteries.
- There's got to be 40 of them.

01:18:03.240 --> 01:18:06.027
Look, we got power here.

01:18:23.343 --> 01:18:26.593
This is no ordinary furnace.

01:18:33.268 --> 01:18:37.895
<i>What's that?</i>

01:18:44.488 --> 01:18:46.943
<i>Yo, Rumsfield!</i>

01:18:52.662 --> 01:18:55.947
<i>Awesome!</i>

01:18:56.040 --> 01:18:58.531
<i>Mr Rumsfield, are you okay?</i>

01:18:58.626 --> 01:19:01.295
- Yes, yes, I'm all right.
- That was very cool, man.

01:19:02.588 --> 01:19:05.210
Art. Art, look.

01:19:05.299 --> 01:19:07.707
- Look! I found it!
- That's loose dirt.

01:19:07.802 --> 01:19:11.845
They must have burned his
body up in the furnace...

01:19:11.930 --> 01:19:13.887
and then buried his
bones right here.

01:19:13.974 --> 01:19:16.761
What do we do now?

01:19:19.646 --> 01:19:21.555
I'll tell him that they built
a crematorium down here.

01:19:21.648 --> 01:19:25.693
Don't tell him that. He'll just want to
come down. Wait 'til we find something.

01:19:25.777 --> 01:19:28.398
Ray, that could take all night.

01:19:33.951 --> 01:19:38.577
Mr Rumsfield, you guys managed to knock
out the power in the entire block.

01:19:38.664 --> 01:19:40.989
<i>Probably the whole
south end of town.</i>

01:19:41.083 --> 01:19:43.040
Ricky, shut up!

01:19:43.585 --> 01:19:46.586
- Shh.
- We're gonna make a run to McD's.

01:19:46.672 --> 01:19:49.459
- You want a Quarterpounder or something?
- Oh, no way!

01:19:49.550 --> 01:19:52.254
Hey, you guys can't go now.
It's the best part.

01:19:52.343 --> 01:19:55.843
- I called the pizza dude.
- All right!

01:20:25.751 --> 01:20:28.621
<i>Ray, I think we can give up.
They'd never bury him this deep.</i>

01:20:28.712 --> 01:20:34.334
<i>Who, besides us, would dig this
deep into this kind of sludge?</i>

01:20:34.425 --> 01:20:36.963
<i>That was metal!</i>

01:20:37.053 --> 01:20:39.508
- Hey!
- That was metal! You hit a crypt!

01:20:39.597 --> 01:20:45.137
They buried him in a crypt!
I'll get my blowtorch! I'll call it in!

01:20:45.227 --> 01:20:49.853
Hello! Hey, uh... Eagle Eye,
this is Ground Force One.

01:20:49.940 --> 01:20:53.273
We have found Walter! We found
Walter! I'll be out in a minute!

01:20:53.360 --> 01:20:57.227
Dig there! Dig there!
Oh, yes! We found him!

01:20:59.574 --> 01:21:01.816
We caught you, Reub.

01:21:01.910 --> 01:21:05.326
You've been playing us for
saps, but you were wrong.

01:21:48.454 --> 01:21:50.660
<i>Mr Weingartner! Art!</i>

01:21:50.747 --> 01:21:53.784
Look! Look over there!
Look! Right now!

01:22:01.049 --> 01:22:02.923
Go on. Go on. I'll...

01:22:04.636 --> 01:22:06.545
<i>Walter!</i>

01:22:09.474 --> 01:22:12.427
<i>Let me go. I'm all right.</i>

01:22:12.518 --> 01:22:15.852
Ray! Raymond!

01:22:16.814 --> 01:22:19.270
<i>Listen up real carefully, mister.</i>

01:22:19.358 --> 01:22:21.647
We got a real problem.

01:22:21.736 --> 01:22:25.270
Hey, Ray, guess who's not
in the basement? Walter!

01:22:25.364 --> 01:22:27.902
He's back! He's back!

01:22:35.206 --> 01:22:38.907
<i>Klopeks! With coppers!</i>

01:22:41.129 --> 01:22:43.038
Keep 'em busy. Keep 'em busy.
I'll get Ray.

01:22:43.131 --> 01:22:46.049
<i>- Keep them busy!
- All right, okay, all right!</i>

01:22:46.134 --> 01:22:50.380
Stop! Stop right there!
Don't go any further!

01:22:50.471 --> 01:22:54.053
You're going! Stop!

01:22:54.141 --> 01:22:57.759
Hey, Mr Officer, wait.

01:22:57.853 --> 01:22:59.762
There are these people
in my parents' house...

01:22:59.855 --> 01:23:01.812
and they're eating all their food!

01:23:08.489 --> 01:23:10.397
<i>Ray, Walter showed up!</i>

01:23:10.490 --> 01:23:14.618
- The Klopeks! I got Ricky down there...
- I hit the gas line! Run!

01:23:14.702 --> 01:23:17.110
- Gas!
- Run!

01:23:17.205 --> 01:23:19.245
<i>- What is the problem here?
- Thank God you're here.</i>

01:23:19.332 --> 01:23:22.203
- No problem, sir.
- This is not a police matter.

01:23:22.293 --> 01:23:24.618
<i>We hit a pipe!
There's all kinds of gas!</i>

01:23:24.712 --> 01:23:27.797
It's gonna blow!

01:23:30.717 --> 01:23:34.501
- All right!
- Ricky sure knows how to throw a party.

01:24:05.001 --> 01:24:07.705
Was that your house?

01:24:15.635 --> 01:24:17.592
Ray.

01:24:23.226 --> 01:24:25.682
Something is moving in there.

01:25:01.679 --> 01:25:04.965
Ray... Ray, you found it, right?

01:25:05.058 --> 01:25:07.264
Before it blew,
you found it, right?

01:25:07.352 --> 01:25:10.435
Hey, tell me you found it.
You found it, right?

01:25:10.520 --> 01:25:14.186
Before everything went off,
you had to have found it.

01:25:15.776 --> 01:25:18.314
You got a lawsuit on
your hands, mister.

01:25:20.864 --> 01:25:24.565
Oh, God, what's this?

01:25:44.345 --> 01:25:47.678
<i>Your attention, please.</i>

01:25:47.765 --> 01:25:50.172
<i>Please stay behind the barricade.</i>

01:25:56.982 --> 01:26:00.232
You want to step back, please?

01:26:00.318 --> 01:26:03.439
- That's my house. - Sorry. I've got to
get the all clear from the gas company.

01:26:03.530 --> 01:26:06.614
- I can clear this. She lives here.
- Did I ask you?

01:26:06.700 --> 01:26:09.273
Miss, you wanna come
back here, please?

01:26:09.369 --> 01:26:11.569
Excuse me, pal. Maybe I didn't
make myself clear enough.

01:26:12.830 --> 01:26:14.869
<i>Hey!</i>

01:26:24.216 --> 01:26:29.555
- Oh, honey, what have they done to you?
- You cut your hair.

01:26:31.681 --> 01:26:33.590
I like it.

01:26:33.683 --> 01:26:36.518
<i>I'm telling you, Officer, there's
a body buried in that house.</i>

01:26:36.603 --> 01:26:39.438
- Mr Seznick, right?
- Yeah, the old guy who's sitting here...

01:26:39.522 --> 01:26:42.013
- is buried in that house, Sherlock.
- Watch it.

01:26:42.108 --> 01:26:44.017
Where was he anyway?

01:26:44.110 --> 01:26:47.064
Mr Seznick was at the hospital
'til 8:00 this evening.

01:26:47.155 --> 01:26:49.823
Monday night he had some
heart palpitations.

01:26:49.907 --> 01:26:54.403
He called his daughter and son-in-law,
and they took him to the hospital.

01:26:54.494 --> 01:26:57.994
What about the wig?
They found a wig in this house.

01:26:58.081 --> 01:27:00.288
- His wig.
- The Klopeks were picking up his mail.

01:27:00.375 --> 01:27:04.836
The doctor somehow got that wig mixed
up with the newspapers and letters.

01:27:04.922 --> 01:27:08.172
"Doctor"? You don't believe that
this guy's a real doctor, do you?

01:27:08.258 --> 01:27:10.582
Yes, I do believe he's a doctor.

01:27:10.676 --> 01:27:14.010
In fact, he's a very well-respected
pathologist, my friend.

01:27:14.096 --> 01:27:18.094
I'd say that you are damn lucky you
didn't kill him in that blast.

01:27:18.184 --> 01:27:22.051
Oh, yeah, I thank my lucky stars.

01:27:22.146 --> 01:27:26.938
- Take care of this nitwit.
- Sorry about your car, man.

01:27:27.026 --> 01:27:31.189
<i>Destruction of private property.
Destruction of public property.</i>

01:27:31.279 --> 01:27:34.364
Three counts of
criminal trespassing.

01:27:34.449 --> 01:27:39.194
Harassment, assault, vandalism.

01:27:39.287 --> 01:27:41.695
And that poor old man claims
he's got a ransom note...

01:27:41.790 --> 01:27:44.245
that says you kidnapped his dog!

01:27:46.628 --> 01:27:49.083
Do you hear me okay, Mr Peterson?

01:27:51.715 --> 01:27:55.843
I really do like your hair, honey.

01:27:55.928 --> 01:27:57.967
<i>You know, this doesn't
change a thing.</i>

01:27:58.055 --> 01:28:00.890
They may think it does. They may think
they're off the hook, but they're not.

01:28:00.975 --> 01:28:03.596
No, they're not. Are they, Ray?
Go ahead, tell 'em.

01:28:03.686 --> 01:28:05.974
We got the goods on 'em, don't we?

01:28:06.063 --> 01:28:08.221
Someday they're gonna dig
up the back of that yard...

01:28:08.315 --> 01:28:10.770
and they're gonna find the rest of
that skeleton to go with that femur.

01:28:10.858 --> 01:28:15.070
- It might not be Walter, but...
- Shut up, Art! Shut up!

01:28:15.154 --> 01:28:18.654
God, you don't know
when to quit, do you?

01:28:18.741 --> 01:28:21.612
Look at me!

01:28:21.703 --> 01:28:24.372
I'm a shell of a man
because of you, Art.

01:28:24.455 --> 01:28:27.706
- Now, now...
- Soldiers!

01:28:27.792 --> 01:28:30.709
You leave 'em alone!
Get off their case already!

01:28:30.794 --> 01:28:35.207
They didn't do anything to us.
They didn't do anything to us!

01:28:35.299 --> 01:28:38.465
All right, so they're different!
So they keep to themselves!

01:28:38.552 --> 01:28:42.087
Can you blame them? They live next door
to people who break into their house...

01:28:42.180 --> 01:28:44.850
and burn it down while
they're gone for the day.

01:28:46.268 --> 01:28:49.850
Remember what you were saying
about people in the 'burbs?

01:28:49.937 --> 01:28:51.846
People like Skip?

01:28:51.939 --> 01:28:57.645
People who mow their lawn for
the 800th time and then snap?

01:28:57.737 --> 01:29:00.903
Well, that's us!
It's not them! That's us!

01:29:00.990 --> 01:29:05.735
We're the ones vaulting over fences and
peeking in through people's windows!

01:29:05.828 --> 01:29:10.288
We're the ones throwing garbage
in the street and lighting fires!

01:29:10.373 --> 01:29:13.160
We're the ones who are acting
suspicious and paranoid, Art!

01:29:13.251 --> 01:29:17.628
We're the lunatics! Us!
It's not them!

01:29:19.215 --> 01:29:21.504
It's us.

01:29:24.179 --> 01:29:28.093
I don't know what to say.

01:29:28.183 --> 01:29:30.091
What, do you want me to move?

01:29:33.938 --> 01:29:36.808
- I'm gonna kill him!
- You're crazy!

01:29:38.901 --> 01:29:41.143
- Back off!
- Stop it! Stop it!

01:29:41.237 --> 01:29:44.652
<i>- Ow! Ow! Ow!
- Break it up!</i>

01:29:44.740 --> 01:29:47.776
- Stop it! Stop it!
- I don't care! I've been blown up!

01:29:47.868 --> 01:29:50.026
Take me to the hospital!

01:29:50.119 --> 01:29:52.610
Take me to a hospital. I'm sick.

01:29:52.705 --> 01:29:58.376
My eye hurts.

01:30:06.719 --> 01:30:09.257
Honey? I'll just...

01:30:09.347 --> 01:30:11.635
find out what hospital
they're taking you to...

01:30:11.723 --> 01:30:15.507
and then I'll...
follow right along.

01:30:15.602 --> 01:30:17.595
<i>- Okay?
- Okay, honey.</i>

01:30:18.897 --> 01:30:21.435
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine, Carol.

01:30:31.075 --> 01:30:34.776
Okay, hepcats, get off my car!

01:30:34.870 --> 01:30:37.540
- Get off my car!
- Dude, you should hang out a little bit.

01:30:37.623 --> 01:30:40.624
- This goes for you!
- We've got the pizza dude coming.

01:30:40.710 --> 01:30:43.414
You imbecile! You sub-moron, you!

01:30:44.005 --> 01:30:48.216
<i>Who's that?</i>

01:30:49.677 --> 01:30:54.919
Oh, Dr Klopek, I'm so sorry.

01:30:55.015 --> 01:30:57.553
You know, Dr Klopek, when
I get out of prison...

01:30:57.642 --> 01:31:00.727
I'm gonna help you
rebuild your house.

01:31:00.812 --> 01:31:04.311
I'll even do some of the
work myself. I have the tools.

01:31:04.399 --> 01:31:07.733
Carol's father just gave me
a brand new set of tools.

01:31:07.819 --> 01:31:12.195
Do I look like an
idiot, Mr Peterson?

01:31:12.281 --> 01:31:14.190
No.

01:31:14.283 --> 01:31:18.328
Do you take me for an imbecile?

01:31:18.412 --> 01:31:20.321
No.

01:31:20.414 --> 01:31:24.957
You may have fooled the
others, Mr Peterson...

01:31:25.044 --> 01:31:27.036
but you don't fool me.

01:31:28.464 --> 01:31:30.621
Uh, I fooled the others?

01:31:30.715 --> 01:31:33.965
<i>- But you don't fool me.
- I don't?</i>

01:31:34.052 --> 01:31:37.006
No, you don't.

01:31:37.096 --> 01:31:39.469
Am I missing something, Doctor?

01:31:39.557 --> 01:31:44.682
Come now, Mr Peterson.
You were in my basement.

01:31:44.771 --> 01:31:49.646
Surely, you looked in the furnace.

01:31:49.733 --> 01:31:54.027
I saw your furnace, Doctor...

01:31:54.112 --> 01:31:58.774
but I figured a man's furnace
is his own business.

01:31:59.868 --> 01:32:03.700
You saw one of my
skulls, didn't you?

01:32:03.789 --> 01:32:06.873
Oh, yes. I know you did.

01:32:07.876 --> 01:32:11.493
It belonged to a
neighbour of yours.

01:32:11.587 --> 01:32:15.799
The name was Knapp.

01:32:15.883 --> 01:32:19.086
We took the house from them.

01:32:19.178 --> 01:32:23.887
I offered to buy it, but you
know how old people are.

01:32:23.975 --> 01:32:27.972
They grow so attached to things.

01:32:28.062 --> 01:32:30.469
Uh, you know, Dr Klopek,
I think I forgot my wallet.

01:32:30.564 --> 01:32:35.309
I let you keep the femur.

01:32:35.402 --> 01:32:39.898
Now, now, I want my skull.

01:32:39.990 --> 01:32:43.822
Or, perhaps, I might
just take yours.

01:32:43.910 --> 01:32:45.654
Hans.

01:32:45.745 --> 01:32:48.746
<i>Uh, hey!</i>

01:33:16.816 --> 01:33:18.939
<i>Hey, the pizza dude!</i>

01:33:25.617 --> 01:33:27.526
Yeah! Way to go!

01:33:37.920 --> 01:33:41.502
Far out.

01:33:46.929 --> 01:33:50.593
Citizen's arrest! Citizen's arrest!

01:33:52.099 --> 01:33:56.311
I, Ray Peterson, am placing
you under citizen's arrest...

01:33:56.395 --> 01:33:58.471
for my attempted murder!

01:33:58.564 --> 01:34:00.473
The man doesn't know
what he's talking about.

01:34:00.566 --> 01:34:03.022
- Citizen's arrest. Citizen's arrest.
- Oh, Ray.

01:34:03.110 --> 01:34:05.981
Don't start with me, Carol. The man
confessed. They murdered the Knapps.

01:34:06.072 --> 01:34:08.064
<i>- He's demented.
- Hey, Sherlock.</i>

01:34:08.157 --> 01:34:10.730
<i>Get the Klopeks to tell you
where they buried the stiffs.</i>

01:34:10.825 --> 01:34:13.862
<i>You don't have a stiff.
You don't have any evidence.</i>

01:34:13.954 --> 01:34:15.863
You do now.

01:34:27.008 --> 01:34:28.965
This your vehicle, Dr Klopek?

01:34:33.013 --> 01:34:35.587
<i>Let's go, Doc.</i>

01:34:35.683 --> 01:34:40.309
Hey! Pinocchio!

01:34:40.396 --> 01:34:42.353
Where are you going?

01:34:46.986 --> 01:34:49.109
Gotcha!

01:34:53.825 --> 01:34:56.660
Don't you make a move, sonny.

01:34:56.744 --> 01:35:01.702
I was 18 months in the bush, and I
can snap your neck in a heartbeat.

01:35:01.791 --> 01:35:04.958
I think the message to psychos,
fanatics, murderers...

01:35:05.044 --> 01:35:06.954
nutcases all over
the world is, uh...

01:35:07.046 --> 01:35:11.458
do not mess with suburbanites because,
uh, we're not gonna take it any more.

01:35:11.550 --> 01:35:13.424
We're not gonna be content
to look after our lawns...

01:35:13.510 --> 01:35:15.337
and wax our cars, paint our houses.

01:35:15.429 --> 01:35:18.549
We're out to get 'em, Don.
We are out to get them.

01:35:22.728 --> 01:35:24.767
- Hello.
- Hi.

01:35:26.648 --> 01:35:30.645
So, what are you gonna do now?

01:35:30.735 --> 01:35:34.898
I'm gonna pack a bag
and go up to the lake.

01:35:34.989 --> 01:35:36.898
We got 'em, neighbour.

01:35:38.117 --> 01:35:41.652
- Get away from him.
- Hey, you guys.

01:35:41.746 --> 01:35:44.581
You wanna go down to Bowl-O-Rama
for a beer or something?

01:35:44.665 --> 01:35:48.366
Man, that was an incredible choke hold
you put on me, pal. The guy's a brute.

01:35:48.461 --> 01:35:50.369
How's that finger? Is it okay?

01:35:50.462 --> 01:35:52.538
Where are you guys going?
Where you going?

01:35:52.631 --> 01:35:55.252
I'm going on vacation.

01:35:55.342 --> 01:35:57.667
"Vacation"? What, are you crazy?

01:35:57.761 --> 01:35:59.800
This is a major media event here.

01:35:59.888 --> 01:36:03.838
Geraldo Rivera's coming, and he's gonna
excavate the basement of the Klopeks!

01:36:03.934 --> 01:36:08.097
It's gonna be broadcast on satellite
all over the world, live!

01:36:08.188 --> 01:36:10.096
Art!

01:36:10.189 --> 01:36:13.059
Your wife's home.

01:36:13.150 --> 01:36:16.815
- And your house is on fire!
- Art, where are you?

01:36:17.947 --> 01:36:19.524
My wife is home!

01:36:19.615 --> 01:36:22.818
Mr Peterson, where you going?

01:36:22.910 --> 01:36:25.864
It's just starting to get good.

01:36:25.955 --> 01:36:28.790
I'm going away for a while, Ricky.

01:36:31.960 --> 01:36:35.792
I want you to keep an eye on
the neighbourhood for me.

01:36:35.880 --> 01:36:38.585
You betcha, Mr Peterson.

01:36:38.675 --> 01:36:41.592
<i>No problem.</i>

01:36:57.317 --> 01:36:59.274
God, I love this street.
