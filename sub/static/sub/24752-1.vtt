WEBVTT

01:40.400 --> 01:41.675
Huh?

01:41.840 --> 01:42.910
Whoa!

01:52.560 --> 01:55.029
Yes, keep going!

01:55.520 --> 01:59.673
- Woohoo!
- Maya! But I wanna get off!

01:59.880 --> 02:02.600
Oh, can't we just...

02:02.760 --> 02:05.958
Willi! Close your mouth!
You're slowing us down!

02:07.640 --> 02:08.789
Woohoo!

02:15.360 --> 02:16.271
Hey!

02:19.240 --> 02:20.959
They're getting away!

02:21.240 --> 02:22.754
Whoa, whoa!

02:24.240 --> 02:26.994
Whoa!

02:27.160 --> 02:29.470
Hey, ease up on the feelers!

02:29.640 --> 02:30.517
Sorry!

02:31.240 --> 02:32.720
Go, Drago, faster!

02:32.920 --> 02:36.357
You wanna go faster, huh?
I'll show you faster!

02:41.160 --> 02:42.480
Maya, stop!

02:46.080 --> 02:49.551
- Huh?
- Faster, Drago, faster!

02:52.520 --> 02:54.796
Oh no!

02:55.560 --> 02:57.517
- What are you doing!?
- We can make it!

02:57.680 --> 02:59.353
- No, Maya don't even...
- Now, Drago!

02:59.520 --> 03:01.079
Maya!

03:08.040 --> 03:08.996
Huh?

03:10.480 --> 03:11.596
Whoa!

03:23.160 --> 03:24.799
That was so fun, did you see?

03:24.960 --> 03:28.351
We were flying upside down,
and were like...

03:28.560 --> 03:31.792
You guys were awesome!
Now who wants to race again?

03:31.960 --> 03:33.474
Um, uh...

03:33.640 --> 03:35.393
We've gotta go clean our leaf.

03:35.560 --> 03:38.075
We've gotta go clean our leaf.
Bye Maya!

03:39.160 --> 03:41.391
Wow, Maya, that was amazing!

03:41.560 --> 03:43.756
You're so fast, you should
totally be in the Honey Games!

03:43.920 --> 03:49.234
Thanks, Ronnie, I'd love to,
but our hive never gets invited.

03:49.440 --> 03:51.477
Yep, and I think
that's a good thing.

03:51.720 --> 03:52.949
I've had it with racing.

03:53.200 --> 03:55.032
Aw Willi,
we were just having fun!

03:55.200 --> 03:57.999
You were having fun, Maya.
I was having...

03:58.160 --> 04:00.755
What's the opposite of fun?

04:00.920 --> 04:03.310
- Not-fun?
- Not-fun. Thanks, Ronnie.

04:03.480 --> 04:04.391
You're welcome.

04:04.560 --> 04:05.676
- Willi!
- What?

04:05.840 --> 04:07.160
Tag!

04:07.320 --> 04:08.720
Oh, Maya.

04:09.560 --> 04:10.880
Why don't you ever listen?

04:12.160 --> 04:14.117
- Tag, you're in.
- In what?

04:14.280 --> 04:16.511
- It doesn't matter.
- Bye, Willi!

04:16.680 --> 04:19.353
Bye, Ronnie! Hey, wait for me!

04:37.320 --> 04:39.835
Gather round children,
come and get your honey cakes.

04:40.880 --> 04:42.678
One for you.

04:42.920 --> 04:43.990
Here's yours.

04:44.840 --> 04:46.035
Hey wait for me!

04:46.200 --> 04:49.034
And for you... Oh! No.

04:49.200 --> 04:51.351
Oh, happy Harvest, Your Majesty!

04:51.360 --> 04:54.398
Oh!
And happy Harvest to you.

04:54.600 --> 04:55.920
Is everything in order, Crawley?

04:56.120 --> 04:58.112
Certainly, ma'am. The honey
barrels are being stacked

04:58.280 --> 05:00.158
in the Great Hall as we speak.

05:31.760 --> 05:34.116
Is... is that all of it,
Crawley?

05:34.280 --> 05:37.352
Uh, it...
It was a short summer, ma'am.

05:37.560 --> 05:38.550
Oh.

05:38.800 --> 05:41.599
Don't worry,
everything will be just fine.

05:46.360 --> 05:47.430
Come on, Willi, we're late.

05:47.600 --> 05:49.239
Coming!

05:50.120 --> 05:51.952
I told you we're going
the wrong way.

05:52.160 --> 05:53.674
No we're not! This is the way.

05:53.840 --> 05:54.830
Huh?

05:59.520 --> 06:00.636
Ow!

06:01.120 --> 06:02.190
Whoa.

06:02.360 --> 06:04.158
Grr!

06:05.400 --> 06:07.631
Hello, Mr. Important
Looking Big Bee, Sir.

06:07.840 --> 06:10.400
Sorry we bumped into you.
I'm Maya and this is Willi.

06:11.080 --> 06:12.355
Hmm, indeed.

06:12.520 --> 06:14.352
- I am looking for Poppy Meadow.
- Hmm. Huh?

06:14.600 --> 06:18.071
I have a very important message
to deliver to the Queen.

06:18.240 --> 06:21.119
You're from Buzztropolis!

06:21.520 --> 06:22.874
Very observant.

06:23.080 --> 06:24.639
An important message?

06:25.000 --> 06:28.198
That could only mean one thing.
Did you hear that, Willi?

06:28.400 --> 06:29.390
- Did you hear it?
- Ahh...

06:29.560 --> 06:32.678
- We're going to the Honey Games!
- We are?

06:33.440 --> 06:36.035
This is really happening!

06:37.120 --> 06:38.156
Yes!

06:38.840 --> 06:42.914
Follow me, Mr. What'sa-Face.
I'll take you to the Queen!

06:43.760 --> 06:44.557
Ahh...

06:44.720 --> 06:46.632
Oh, Maya.

06:48.640 --> 06:49.790
Hmm.

06:54.760 --> 06:57.116
Hurray for Poppy Meadow.

06:57.320 --> 07:00.631
I know it has been a long
and difficult harvest

07:00.800 --> 07:01.597
for everyone.

07:02.200 --> 07:05.113
You have toiled tirelessly
<i>to collect the pollen...</i>

07:05.360 --> 07:06.589
Happy Harvest, Maya!

07:07.000 --> 07:08.400
Happy Harvest!

07:08.960 --> 07:10.314
Come on, this way.

07:10.520 --> 07:13.399
...<i>teamwork,
collaboration and community</i>

07:13.600 --> 07:15.637
is at the heart of the harvest.

07:18.160 --> 07:22.393
By working together, we will
all see it through another year.

07:26.600 --> 07:29.559
Well done, Poppy Meadow.

07:29.760 --> 07:32.878
I am Sir Beegood the third.

07:33.080 --> 07:35.834
I come from Buzztropolis
with good news,

07:36.080 --> 07:38.197
direct from the Empress herself.

07:38.400 --> 07:40.392
As you know,

07:40.600 --> 07:43.434
the glorious Honey Games
are about to commence,

07:43.640 --> 07:48.032
and your hive has been selected
for a great, great honor...

07:48.480 --> 07:49.709
Told you, Willi!

07:49.880 --> 07:52.236
They're inviting us
to the Honey Games!

07:52.400 --> 07:54.596
...to generously contribute

07:54.920 --> 07:58.357
half your honey harvest
to the Honey Games!

07:58.640 --> 07:59.994
Oh no!

08:00.160 --> 08:03.232
Yay!

08:03.920 --> 08:05.400
Wait. What?

08:05.560 --> 08:09.315
What? Half our honey?
That's nearly 50 percent!

08:09.480 --> 08:11.870
You can't do that!
It's not fair!

08:12.040 --> 08:13.474
Maya, no.

08:15.280 --> 08:17.476
It is an honor indeed,
Sir Beegood,

08:17.760 --> 08:20.320
however, your request
is unreasonable.

08:20.680 --> 08:24.356
We can certainly contribute
a little honey, but half?

08:24.800 --> 08:26.632
Our hive won't make it
through the winter.

08:26.920 --> 08:31.153
You dare refuse
the Empress' order?

08:35.679 --> 08:37.318
Hmm.

08:40.559 --> 08:42.357
As the Empress wishes.

08:44.720 --> 08:46.598
Quite right.

08:49.400 --> 08:51.198
No, wait, Mr. Bigbuzz!

08:51.360 --> 08:54.159
I mean, Sir Bees...
Whatever your name is!

08:54.440 --> 08:57.035
You've made a big mistake!

08:57.840 --> 09:00.833
Oh, Willi,
we have to do something.

09:01.000 --> 09:03.640
Well, yeah,
someone needs to do something.

09:03.800 --> 09:06.998
Aw, it's gonna
be a long, hungry winter.

09:11.880 --> 09:13.280
Your Majesty?

09:14.000 --> 09:15.832
We can't let the Empress
take our honey!

09:16.040 --> 09:19.590
The Empress will do
whatever she wants.

09:19.760 --> 09:21.160
It's not fair!

09:21.320 --> 09:25.360
My big sister doesn't play fair,
she never has.

09:25.520 --> 09:27.910
She's your sister?

09:28.640 --> 09:29.630
Oh! Well, then it's easy.

09:30.160 --> 09:32.356
If she's your sister, then you
can just go talk to her.

09:32.520 --> 09:34.273
She won't listen to me.

09:34.880 --> 09:36.030
Maybe I can help.

09:36.200 --> 09:37.520
No, Maya.

09:37.840 --> 09:40.958
There are some things
you can't fix on your own.

09:41.120 --> 09:43.954
Excuse me, ma'am.
You're needed in the Great Hall.

09:44.960 --> 09:47.634
Mm. It's not your concern, Maya.

09:48.840 --> 09:49.830
I can help.

09:53.680 --> 09:55.751
I can't believe
she's the Queen's Sister.

09:55.920 --> 09:57.957
Yeah, and she's a real
meanie bug!

09:58.120 --> 10:00.919
- We have to help the Queen!
- Mm-hm, yep.

10:01.960 --> 10:05.237
Willi, what are you doing?
This is an emergency!

10:05.400 --> 10:07.790
Yeah, and this
is my emergency pollen!

10:08.240 --> 10:11.711
Anyway, how can we help?
We're just two little bees.

10:12.000 --> 10:14.640
Hmm...
We go to Buzztropolis!

10:14.840 --> 10:17.275
Oh, sure,
we'll just hitch a ride

10:17.480 --> 10:18.277
somewhere we've never been

10:18.760 --> 10:20.717
and tell a scary Empress
we don't even know,

10:20.880 --> 10:22.633
"Sorry, but you can't
take our honey."

10:22.800 --> 10:25.269
Yeah! That's a great plan,
Willi! Come on!

10:25.440 --> 10:27.318
What? Plan? What plan?

10:27.640 --> 10:30.997
- Oh, I've got a plan.
- Come on, Willi!

10:31.160 --> 10:32.480
Oh, Maya!

10:37.600 --> 10:40.274
Drago? Hello!

10:40.840 --> 10:43.799
No more racing today.

10:43.960 --> 10:46.600
We don't wanna race,
we need a ride to Buzztropolis!

10:46.760 --> 10:49.673
Huh? That's a long way.
I don't want to go there.

10:49.840 --> 10:52.116
- Come on, Drago. Just this once.
- No, no, no.

10:52.280 --> 10:55.159
- Please? Come on Drago.
- Stop it.

10:55.320 --> 10:58.472
Come on. Come on!

10:58.640 --> 11:00.950
Okay! Okay!
I'll do it, I'll do it.

11:03.400 --> 11:04.311
Ready, Willi?

11:04.480 --> 11:07.120
Uh-uh, not this little bee, no...

11:07.280 --> 11:08.794
Maya!

11:08.960 --> 11:10.997
Buzztropolis here we come!

11:13.720 --> 11:15.598
Right, we must prepare.

11:15.760 --> 11:18.070
Bronson, count up all the honey
barrels in the Great Hall.

11:18.800 --> 11:20.473
Rupert go and tally
the reserves.

11:20.640 --> 11:21.596
Yes, ma'am!

11:21.760 --> 11:25.071
Crawley, you...
Crawley? Crawley!

11:26.760 --> 11:30.117
Your Majesty! Maya and Willi
were seen leaving the meadow!

11:30.280 --> 11:31.953
It looked like
they were heading for...

11:32.120 --> 11:33.474
Buzztropolis.

11:39.200 --> 11:42.352
Woohoo!

11:42.760 --> 11:44.479
Whoa! Whoa!

11:44.680 --> 11:46.876
Whoa, Willi,
look at all those insects.

11:49.920 --> 11:51.240
They're going
to the Honey Games.

11:51.400 --> 11:53.676
Yeah, but they are invited.

11:54.040 --> 11:56.191
Whoa, what is that?

11:56.400 --> 11:59.677
That is Buzztropolis.

12:03.640 --> 12:05.950
It's beautiful.

12:15.080 --> 12:17.879
- Good luck, kids.
- Thanks, Drago.

12:18.040 --> 12:20.396
Come on, Willi.
Let's find the Empress!

12:20.560 --> 12:22.472
Uh, no, I'll just wait here
with Drago.

12:22.640 --> 12:25.553
Whoa!
On second thoughts, coming!

12:34.920 --> 12:36.240
- Whoa.
- Wow.

12:37.920 --> 12:39.513
Maya...

12:42.480 --> 12:44.995
- Hello.
- Hello!

12:46.960 --> 12:48.280
Whoa! Whoa!

12:49.480 --> 12:52.393
- Maya, wait!
- Well, hurry up, Willi!

12:53.120 --> 12:55.680
Whoa!

12:56.360 --> 12:57.760
So pretty!

13:02.800 --> 13:05.190
This was a mistake.

13:05.360 --> 13:07.920
I know what I'm doing, Willi.
Trust me.

13:08.200 --> 13:10.431
Bee best friends forever?

13:10.680 --> 13:12.239
Buzz buzz buzz!

13:12.600 --> 13:14.637
Willi, look!

13:15.080 --> 13:16.036
Maya!

13:16.360 --> 13:18.829
- Get your honey treats here!
- Honey treats?

13:19.080 --> 13:21.311
Must... have... honey treats.

13:22.360 --> 13:23.111
Willi?

13:23.960 --> 13:24.757
Willi?

13:26.520 --> 13:27.636
Willi!

13:28.160 --> 13:30.277
Willi? Willi!

13:31.280 --> 13:32.714
Where are you, Willi?

13:32.880 --> 13:33.677
- Hey!
- Whoops.

13:34.320 --> 13:37.597
Whoops yourself! Step away
from the hair, meadow bug.

13:38.360 --> 13:42.240
Sorry, I'm looking for my friend
Willi, have you seen him?

13:42.400 --> 13:44.551
Uh... no.

13:44.760 --> 13:48.197
Ah. But we have urgent business
with the Empress.

13:49.440 --> 13:52.274
You? With the Empress?

13:52.440 --> 13:55.751
Oh, sure you do,
and my uncle's a dung beetle!

13:55.920 --> 13:59.038
Really?
You don't smell like dung.

14:00.360 --> 14:01.874
What? Ugh!

14:02.040 --> 14:03.440
Stop sniffing me!

14:05.040 --> 14:07.635
Hmm.
Want to see the Empress, huh?

14:08.120 --> 14:10.271
Her throne's right around there.

14:10.440 --> 14:12.796
Why don't you just buzz over
and talk to her?

14:12.960 --> 14:15.429
Oh! I will. Thanks.

14:17.480 --> 14:20.632
I almost feel sorry for her.
Almost.

14:26.440 --> 14:28.796
Wow.

14:29.560 --> 14:31.040
<i>All hive representatives</i>

14:31.200 --> 14:35.319
with donations to the Empress,
<i>please assemble in the arena.</i>

14:36.840 --> 14:40.436
Willi! I was so worried
about you.

14:40.600 --> 14:42.034
I was worried about me too.

14:42.800 --> 14:44.917
Now I'm worried I can't breathe.

14:45.200 --> 14:47.351
How did you end up in the queue
to meet the Empress?

14:47.520 --> 14:49.557
Empress? I thought this
was the line for lunch.

15:05.280 --> 15:07.749
Bring forth my gifts.

15:14.040 --> 15:16.350
Please accept
our Honey Games offering

15:16.560 --> 15:19.200
of fine moth silk,
noble Empress.

15:21.320 --> 15:23.118
- Here!
- And here!

15:25.880 --> 15:27.758
Whoa!

15:27.920 --> 15:28.751
Next.

15:28.920 --> 15:30.593
Maya, what do we do?

15:30.760 --> 15:32.513
I've never met
an Empress before.

15:32.800 --> 15:35.110
Follow me
and put on a brave face.

15:35.360 --> 15:36.953
This is my brave face.

15:38.080 --> 15:39.514
She's actually doing it.

15:39.800 --> 15:42.360
Seriously, I mean like, wow.

15:42.760 --> 15:44.035
- You've gotta be brave...
- Hmph!

15:44.200 --> 15:46.396
...to front up to...
the Empress.

15:46.760 --> 15:48.240
Or a real Fuzzbrain.

15:51.440 --> 15:53.955
May I present Hive Ambassador,

15:54.120 --> 15:56.191
<i>♪ Maya the bee ♪</i>

15:56.360 --> 15:57.271
That's me!

15:57.800 --> 16:01.476
Representing the Queen
of Poppy Meadow, your sister.

16:01.640 --> 16:03.597
Poppy Meadow, mm?

16:03.840 --> 16:06.719
Come to donate
your finest summer Honey?

16:07.160 --> 16:10.437
Uh, that's what I wanted
to talk to you about.

16:10.720 --> 16:13.030
We don't have it.

16:13.240 --> 16:16.119
What? Is this some kind
of a prank?

16:16.320 --> 16:17.117
Guards!

16:17.480 --> 16:19.915
Eject these meadow grubs.

16:20.120 --> 16:22.032
Wait! It's not fair,
Miss Empressy!

16:22.360 --> 16:24.192
Why should we give you
our honey,

16:24.360 --> 16:27.080
when you won't even let us
compete in the Games?

16:30.280 --> 16:31.509
Why?

16:31.920 --> 16:34.799
The child wants to know why.

16:35.040 --> 16:38.033
Because I am the Empress!

16:38.200 --> 16:39.998
That's why!

16:40.560 --> 16:43.678
How dare my sister
send you here empty-handed?

16:44.800 --> 16:48.476
- No, no, no. She didn't.
- Uh... um...

16:48.640 --> 16:51.997
Sir Willington, may I please
have the Queen's royal gift

16:52.160 --> 16:54.550
- to the Empress?
- Huh? The what?

16:54.720 --> 16:55.949
Give me the honey treat.

16:56.520 --> 16:57.636
Nuh-uh.

16:57.800 --> 16:59.314
One moment, Miss Empressy.

16:59.480 --> 17:01.437
Willi, give it to me now!

17:10.640 --> 17:13.030
- Let me help you.
- No! Stay away!

17:15.000 --> 17:16.194
Willi, help!

17:29.040 --> 17:31.839
Ha! Typical meadow bug.

17:33.640 --> 17:34.994
- Maya?
- Oh.

17:38.840 --> 17:42.595
I've never been so humiliated
in my life, Beatrice!

17:43.240 --> 17:44.594
She must be punished!

17:44.760 --> 17:47.116
I will talk to her, Catherine.

17:47.360 --> 17:51.320
She assaults the Empress
and you'll talk to her?

17:51.480 --> 17:53.995
This is why your hive
is a laughing stock.

17:54.160 --> 17:56.550
- We are not!
- Really?

17:56.760 --> 17:59.229
No order. No rules.

17:59.400 --> 18:04.031
Little bees who talk
out of turn. Grr!

18:04.600 --> 18:08.196
And you wonder why I don't
invite you to the Honey Games.

18:08.360 --> 18:10.238
Maybe you're scared we'll win.

18:10.480 --> 18:12.392
Oh, please.

18:12.560 --> 18:15.359
The Honey Games
are for elite bugs.

18:15.520 --> 18:17.955
You never had what it takes,
and by the looks

18:18.120 --> 18:20.430
of this bumble bug,
neither does she.

18:20.600 --> 18:23.354
Maya is one of my best bees.

18:23.840 --> 18:27.595
Ha! She's no match
for the best of Buzztropolis.

18:27.760 --> 18:30.559
- I am too! And so is Willi!
- Maya!

18:30.720 --> 18:32.040
It's true.

18:32.200 --> 18:34.590
Poppy Meadow bees
are braver and faster and nicer

18:34.800 --> 18:36.678
than any of you city bees!

18:36.880 --> 18:38.633
- Maya, hush.
- No, no, no.

18:38.840 --> 18:41.719
If your little bee
is so confident,

18:42.200 --> 18:46.433
I invite her and her friend
to compete in the Games.

18:51.800 --> 18:54.554
If they win, all is forgiven.

18:55.040 --> 18:56.360
But if they lose,

18:56.960 --> 18:58.872
I'll make an example
of this pair

18:59.040 --> 19:01.760
and take all your summer honey.

19:02.360 --> 19:04.591
Every last drop.

19:05.440 --> 19:07.272
But our hive
won't last the winter!

19:08.960 --> 19:12.192
Poppy Meadow doesn't even
have a team! We're not prepared.

19:13.240 --> 19:16.312
Beegood, assemble a squad

19:16.480 --> 19:20.156
of Poppy Meadow's
most gifted bugs immediately.

19:20.520 --> 19:24.355
Yes, your regal-ness.
Of course.

19:25.120 --> 19:28.033
Let the games begin.

19:36.080 --> 19:38.515
I am very disappointed
in you, Maya.

19:38.840 --> 19:42.151
I specifically asked you
not to get involved.

19:42.320 --> 19:44.835
I know. I just wanted to help.

19:45.680 --> 19:47.558
But I didn't, did I?

19:48.480 --> 19:51.996
You have to stop buzzing in,
thinking you know what's best.

19:52.440 --> 19:54.318
I'm so sorry, Miss Queen.

19:56.560 --> 19:58.472
Well, we're here now.

19:59.280 --> 20:01.272
And you can't win these Games
on your own.

20:01.640 --> 20:03.950
You must listen to your team.

20:04.520 --> 20:06.716
I will. I promise.

20:09.960 --> 20:11.155
Time to go, ma'am.

20:12.520 --> 20:14.398
I believe in you, Maya.

20:15.080 --> 20:17.515
I know you can
make Poppy Meadow proud.

20:18.040 --> 20:19.269
Mm-hm.

20:21.240 --> 20:22.720
- Willi?
- Huh?

20:22.920 --> 20:25.355
Maya, make sure
you stick together.

20:26.280 --> 20:28.158
And good luck.

20:32.760 --> 20:37.312
Willi, the whole hive
is depending on us.

20:38.000 --> 20:39.639
Hmm, yeah.

20:40.680 --> 20:43.240
But hey, this won't be so hard.

20:43.720 --> 20:46.440
I mean, you are the fastest
racer in Poppy Meadow.

20:46.760 --> 20:51.152
Whoa.
The Honey Games Village.

20:54.240 --> 20:57.358
All bugs report
to the gathering place.

20:57.520 --> 21:01.036
Orientation will commence
in five minutes.

21:01.200 --> 21:02.998
- Come on!
- Oh, hey, wait for me.

21:05.880 --> 21:08.236
You're right Willi,
we can do this.

21:08.400 --> 21:10.517
We just need
to put our best foot forward.

21:10.680 --> 21:13.195
Uh, but which one
is my best foot?

21:20.680 --> 21:22.478
Hey, wait for me! Whoa!

21:22.640 --> 21:24.836
Willi, look at all
the different bugs!

21:26.600 --> 21:29.354
Look! Willi?

21:36.760 --> 21:37.989
Can I help you?

21:41.120 --> 21:44.591
Hello? Do you speak, goggle-bug?

21:45.440 --> 21:47.397
Ahh. Hi.

21:47.560 --> 21:50.155
I'm Willi,
and this is my best foot.

21:51.120 --> 21:53.476
Or is it this one?

21:55.480 --> 21:57.233
Ugh! Let's buzz.

21:58.720 --> 22:01.918
- Mm.
- Willi! There you are!

22:02.920 --> 22:03.831
Willi?

22:05.200 --> 22:06.600
That looks like our flag!

22:08.600 --> 22:10.717
Um, where's our team?

22:10.920 --> 22:13.799
The weird new bugs?

22:14.000 --> 22:15.878
They're hiding
down at Skeeter Swamp.

22:16.080 --> 22:17.639
Good luck with that bunch.

22:22.400 --> 22:23.880
Good evening, bugs.

22:24.040 --> 22:26.635
Welcome
to the Honey Games Village.

22:26.800 --> 22:30.510
I am Games Master Beegood.

22:33.520 --> 22:35.159
Flip!

22:35.320 --> 22:37.391
Hey Flip, over here!

22:39.960 --> 22:42.873
Maya! Fancy seein' you
'ere little buzzer!

22:46.200 --> 22:47.520
Thank you.

22:47.840 --> 22:49.832
Over the next three days,

22:50.000 --> 22:52.595
teams representing
the five meadows

22:52.760 --> 22:55.229
will compete against each other.

22:55.560 --> 23:00.271
At the end of each day,
one team will be eliminated.

23:00.520 --> 23:03.080
This year's teams are...

23:03.880 --> 23:06.759
Team Buggy Hollow!

23:06.920 --> 23:09.515
Team Burly Bluff!

23:09.720 --> 23:12.155
Team Aphid Gorge!

23:13.400 --> 23:14.754
Team Tropolis!

23:17.160 --> 23:19.720
And finally,
the surprising addition

23:19.880 --> 23:23.476
to this year's lineup,
Team Poppy Meadow.

23:23.640 --> 23:25.552
That's us Willi!

23:26.000 --> 23:29.710
On the final day,
the two remaining teams

23:29.880 --> 23:32.395
will compete
in front of the Empress...

23:33.520 --> 23:35.876
...for The Honey Cup!

23:40.000 --> 23:43.198
Willi, we're gonna win that cup.

23:46.480 --> 23:48.392
We're gonna win that cup.

23:49.240 --> 23:50.469
Bye Willi.

23:53.280 --> 23:54.600
Bye.

23:57.240 --> 23:59.755
So, where's our cabin?

24:04.360 --> 24:05.840
Over here.

24:11.600 --> 24:13.319
Uh, I don't know.

24:13.480 --> 24:15.631
- It doesn't look very safe.
- Hello little ones.

24:15.800 --> 24:16.916
Flip!

24:17.800 --> 24:18.950
Are you lost?

24:19.120 --> 24:20.713
We're looking
for Team Poppy's cabin.

24:20.920 --> 24:25.437
Oh, you won't find it up there.
That's Slug Hill, a nasty place.

24:25.680 --> 24:28.673
It's out of bounds.
Your cabin's just over there.

24:29.680 --> 24:31.000
Who's on our team, Flip?

24:31.160 --> 24:33.720
They said it would be
the finest bugs in Poppy Meadow.

24:34.080 --> 24:36.436
Well, I hope
we know some of them.

24:36.640 --> 24:38.199
There's only one way
to find out.

24:38.480 --> 24:40.676
Thanks, Flip! Come on Willi!

24:40.840 --> 24:42.513
Good luck you two!

24:42.680 --> 24:45.275
Poppy Meadow
believes in you, kiddo!

24:50.440 --> 24:53.717
Hello, anybody there?

24:54.240 --> 24:55.913
Hello?

25:02.240 --> 25:04.630
Uh, guys. You can come out.

25:04.840 --> 25:07.435
It's, like, not Violet.

25:07.840 --> 25:09.559
Maya, quick, hide!

25:09.720 --> 25:11.791
Uh, maybe I'm in
the wrong place.

25:11.960 --> 25:13.633
I bet it's one of her friends.

25:13.880 --> 25:16.759
Beat it, city bee! This cave's
for Poppy Meadow bugs only!

25:17.040 --> 25:18.918
I am a Poppy Meadow bug!

25:21.560 --> 25:23.517
She doesn't smell
like one of Violet's friends.

25:23.760 --> 25:26.275
- Violet's not my friend.
- Lucky you.

25:26.440 --> 25:27.920
That girl's meaner
than a scorpion

25:28.120 --> 25:29.395
that stung its own backside.

25:29.560 --> 25:31.040
And she's mean too.

25:31.200 --> 25:35.797
And she thinks she's, like,
so funny, but she's so not.

25:36.120 --> 25:38.999
She won't be laughing
when we win that golden cup.

25:39.760 --> 25:42.514
Guys wait, she's serious.

25:43.880 --> 25:45.951
No one thinks we can win.

25:46.640 --> 25:49.712
But aren't you the finest bugs
in Poppy Meadow?

25:52.560 --> 25:53.835
That's so funny.

25:54.120 --> 25:56.396
We're only here
because Beegood said

25:56.600 --> 25:58.512
we'd won a trip
to the Honey Games.

25:59.000 --> 26:00.912
He never told us
we had to compete.

26:02.320 --> 26:06.200
Don't stress, the sooner we lose
the sooner we can go home.

26:06.440 --> 26:08.909
What? No! I have to win.

26:09.320 --> 26:11.073
We have to win!

26:13.440 --> 26:15.477
Anyway,
what's your name little bee?

26:16.200 --> 26:18.715
I'm Maya,
and that's my friend Willi.

26:18.960 --> 26:21.600
- Hi. Maya, run now!
- What's your name?

26:21.760 --> 26:23.991
I'm Craig,
pleased to meet...

26:24.840 --> 26:28.038
Don't worry about Craig,
he hates germs.

26:28.920 --> 26:31.116
I'm sorry little bee,
I just don't shake hands,

26:31.280 --> 26:32.600
unless they're mine.

26:33.120 --> 26:35.954
The spider up there is Spinder.
She's a vegetarian.

26:36.120 --> 26:39.192
If it's got a face,
I don't eat it.

26:43.920 --> 26:47.038
And the angry little bedbug
over there is Bedford.

26:49.200 --> 26:51.669
Just one thing with him,
sometimes he bites.

26:53.680 --> 26:55.831
Strangers!
Save yourselves.

26:56.840 --> 26:59.594
Hut hut hut hut hut hut hut!

27:00.080 --> 27:02.834
Privates Arnie and Barney
reporting for Games duty, sir!

27:03.000 --> 27:04.798
What're you two doing here?

27:04.960 --> 27:07.873
Well, Maya, a little bird told
us you might need some help.

27:08.040 --> 27:09.713
And then it tried to eat us.

27:09.880 --> 27:11.712
It was actually
quite a big bird.

27:11.880 --> 27:14.190
So, here we are,
peak physical specimens.

27:14.400 --> 27:15.197
- Higher!
- Faster.

27:15.440 --> 27:16.191
- Stronger!
- Weaker.

27:16.480 --> 27:17.470
Beatle, sunshine, raindrop.

27:17.800 --> 27:19.234
Now you're just
listing words, Arnie,

27:19.400 --> 27:21.198
- but who needs words?
- Not me, Barney.

27:21.440 --> 27:22.954
Actions speak louder than words.

27:23.160 --> 27:25.629
Burpees!

27:25.800 --> 27:26.711
Chin ups!

27:26.880 --> 27:28.678
Feel the burn. Feel the burn!

27:28.840 --> 27:29.876
It's burning.

27:30.080 --> 27:31.434
And shake it off.

27:32.320 --> 27:33.993
These guys are strange.

27:34.160 --> 27:36.516
Don't worry,
they'll grow on you.

27:36.720 --> 27:38.154
- Huh?
- Grow on us?

27:38.320 --> 27:40.391
Like fungus?

27:40.840 --> 27:42.354
You can sleep over there.

27:44.520 --> 27:47.399
Good night!
Hut hut hut hut hut hut!

27:49.560 --> 27:51.597
We can't win with these bugs.

27:52.080 --> 27:55.232
We can do this.
Every bug has a talent.

28:06.720 --> 28:09.235
I've got my eyes on you,
both of them.

28:24.440 --> 28:26.193
Good morning bugs!

28:26.360 --> 28:31.071
And welcome to day one
of competition!

28:31.280 --> 28:34.751
Today's event is Dodge Ball!

28:35.000 --> 28:40.917
The team with the fewest points
at day's end will be eliminated.

28:41.120 --> 28:42.270
First round,

28:42.440 --> 28:47.117
team Burly Bluff
versus team Poppy Meadow.

28:47.560 --> 28:49.074
Teams into position.

28:49.480 --> 28:52.712
Seriously?
Even their muscles have muscles.

28:54.440 --> 28:55.999
This should be good.

29:01.320 --> 29:04.358
We'll be great, just follow
my lead. Everyone ready?

29:06.840 --> 29:08.194
Play ball!

29:10.120 --> 29:11.190
Whoa!

29:11.840 --> 29:12.956
Whoa!

29:13.320 --> 29:14.310
Okay time out, time out!

29:14.520 --> 29:16.557
- Huh?
- What did he...? What?

29:16.720 --> 29:18.757
Arnie how did you do that?

29:18.920 --> 29:20.195
As long as you make a capital T,

29:20.400 --> 29:23.518
you put this hand on top
of this hand, the game stops.

29:23.680 --> 29:24.636
Show me again!

29:24.800 --> 29:26.075
Oh sure,
you take this hand and...

29:27.480 --> 29:28.800
Extra time...

29:34.680 --> 29:37.400
Team Burly Bluff win!

29:37.560 --> 29:41.076
Boom, show me the love.

29:41.240 --> 29:45.280
Team Burly Bluff
versus Team Tropolis!

29:50.600 --> 29:54.230
Well, well, more little bugs.

29:54.800 --> 29:57.474
Oh, poor Violet, I can't watch.

30:07.240 --> 30:08.560
Oh, no!

30:11.240 --> 30:12.435
Oh no.

30:19.560 --> 30:22.155
Team Tropolis wins!

30:23.920 --> 30:24.910
Next.

30:25.640 --> 30:28.109
Oh, she's really good.

30:28.280 --> 30:30.237
She sure is.

30:30.880 --> 30:32.155
We're good too!

30:32.320 --> 30:34.835
If we work together,
we can achieve anything.

30:35.560 --> 30:40.840
I think motivational
speaking is, like, her thing.

30:41.720 --> 30:46.158
Team Buggy Hollow
versus Team Aphid Gorge!

30:48.200 --> 30:49.953
Aww, how cute.

30:50.160 --> 30:53.756
Don't worry, little baby bugs.
We'll go easy on you.

30:57.640 --> 30:58.960
Let's get 'em all!

31:08.600 --> 31:12.992
Team Tropolis
versus Team Poppy Meadow!

31:15.080 --> 31:18.756
Looking a bit
off-color, Team Poppy.

31:22.080 --> 31:23.594
Team Tropolis attack!

31:23.760 --> 31:25.319
Let's go, Team Poppy!

31:37.600 --> 31:38.431
Willi!

31:38.640 --> 31:39.869
Pollen.

31:45.520 --> 31:47.910
Craig, throw the pollen!

31:50.800 --> 31:53.952
- I'm so out of here.
- Spinder!

31:54.120 --> 31:56.680
Bedford, you have to move.

31:57.920 --> 32:00.913
Ha! Great team you got there,
Maya!

32:09.600 --> 32:10.636
You saved me.

32:11.160 --> 32:12.799
You're my special friend now.

32:13.520 --> 32:15.910
Arnie! Barney! Help Spinder!

32:16.120 --> 32:17.190
Aye, aye, Captain.

32:21.360 --> 32:23.670
- What did she say?
- She said, "Help spin her."

32:23.840 --> 32:25.354
Ten-four, bug daddy! Spin her!

32:25.520 --> 32:26.670
Spin her, now!

32:31.440 --> 32:33.796
- Incoming!
- Outgoing!

32:42.280 --> 32:45.193
Victory to Team Tropolis!

32:45.400 --> 32:46.914
Ha!

32:47.080 --> 32:49.470
Oh, we lost again.

32:49.640 --> 32:51.791
But look, we got some points.

32:52.720 --> 32:53.597
Huh?

32:54.360 --> 32:55.271
We got points!

32:55.440 --> 32:56.760
We've got points!

32:58.160 --> 33:01.312
We got points!
Uh, not that I care.

33:05.280 --> 33:06.873
But, is it enough?

33:12.000 --> 33:16.438
And so ends day one
of competition.

33:16.760 --> 33:19.355
You should all be very proud.

33:19.920 --> 33:24.312
Unfortunately, one team
had to finish last

33:24.880 --> 33:27.634
and today, that team is...

33:29.960 --> 33:31.952
- Buggy Hollow...
- Oh, what?

33:32.120 --> 33:35.716
...who finished just one point
below Team Poppy.

33:36.680 --> 33:37.875
We made it through?

33:39.000 --> 33:41.674
- We made it through! Ha, yes!
- Yeah! Woohoo!

33:44.320 --> 33:45.515
Yes!

33:45.800 --> 33:49.032
Go team! Let's get some food
and celebrate!

33:49.200 --> 33:51.590
I'm gonna go lie down.

33:51.960 --> 33:53.440
Yep. Nighty-night.

33:53.600 --> 33:56.115
See you back at camp, Maya.

33:56.360 --> 33:57.840
I gotta sleep.

33:58.000 --> 33:59.434
Huh. Hmm.

34:01.680 --> 34:02.716
Should we be worried?

34:03.120 --> 34:04.270
About her?

34:04.560 --> 34:06.313
Hardly.

34:09.760 --> 34:12.070
Every bug has a weakness.

34:17.400 --> 34:18.719
Your Empressness,

34:18.880 --> 34:22.190
I have the team scores
after Day One.

34:23.400 --> 34:25.471
Excellent. We're first.

34:29.040 --> 34:31.157
The team scores, Your Majesty.

34:31.400 --> 34:33.915
Excellent! We're not last.

34:51.920 --> 34:54.389
Ew!

34:55.159 --> 34:56.116
Yuck.

34:56.520 --> 34:59.274
Taste it, Willi.
Trying new things is good.

34:59.440 --> 35:02.558
But I don't like new things.
I like pollen.

35:04.560 --> 35:05.960
I have pollen, Willi.

35:07.160 --> 35:09.197
Oh... okay.

35:09.360 --> 35:12.956
Team Tropolis' food
is flown in specially for us.

35:13.240 --> 35:14.515
Wanna join me?

35:14.920 --> 35:18.231
Ah! Violet, thank you!

35:18.440 --> 35:19.715
Hey, come on, Maya!

35:20.280 --> 35:23.318
Yes, Maya. Please, take a seat.

35:23.720 --> 35:26.952
Hmm. Okay, thanks, Violet.

35:29.120 --> 35:31.589
- Sorry, that's Chelsea's spot.
- Huh?

35:33.360 --> 35:35.397
Oh, sorry.

35:35.960 --> 35:38.316
Oops. That's Sandra's.

35:38.520 --> 35:39.874
Hmm?

35:41.680 --> 35:44.593
Spotty, Dotty
and Lotty are there.

35:44.760 --> 35:46.114
Hmm.

35:49.200 --> 35:51.669
That's reserved for Brian.

35:52.480 --> 35:56.633
Hey!
Come back here dinner! Hey!

35:56.840 --> 35:58.433
Oh gee,

35:58.640 --> 36:00.950
looks like there's no room
for you.

36:01.120 --> 36:02.554
Why are you being mean?

36:02.840 --> 36:05.116
Oh, I'm sorry how rude.

36:05.520 --> 36:09.355
Here, have some delicious,
golden pollen.

36:11.800 --> 36:14.998
Oh, dear.
I must have eaten it all.

36:18.360 --> 36:21.273
- Ow! My hand!
- What?

36:21.440 --> 36:23.318
Maya, what did you do?

36:23.480 --> 36:26.120
Nothing.

36:26.280 --> 36:29.239
It hurts! It hurts!

36:29.560 --> 36:31.711
What's wrong,
my little honey-puff?

36:32.120 --> 36:34.077
She smashed my hand!

36:34.240 --> 36:35.390
That's not true!

36:37.360 --> 36:40.831
Are you accusing my daughter
of lying, meadow bug?

36:41.000 --> 36:42.593
- "Daughter"?
- "Daughter"?

36:44.080 --> 36:48.711
Maybe if she
said sorry, I could forgive her.

36:49.040 --> 36:51.760
Very well. Apologize, Maya.

36:51.920 --> 36:53.274
But I...

36:53.480 --> 36:55.437
Maya, just say sorry.

37:00.880 --> 37:04.476
Violet, I'm sorry.

37:04.960 --> 37:07.316
But I didn't do anything!

37:08.480 --> 37:13.316
She's mean, Daddy!

37:13.720 --> 37:15.074
I knew you were a bother

37:15.240 --> 37:17.800
the moment I laid eyes on you,
little bee.

37:18.040 --> 37:19.520
What? No, I just...

37:19.720 --> 37:22.758
Silence! This is your first
and last warning!

37:22.920 --> 37:26.311
Any more trouble from you
and you're out of the Games.

37:26.520 --> 37:27.431
But I...

37:28.080 --> 37:31.073
Uh, what she's trying to say
is she's really sorry.

37:31.440 --> 37:32.920
Aren't you, Maya?

37:33.080 --> 37:34.753
No I'm not!

37:34.920 --> 37:36.149
Thanks, Willi.

37:36.520 --> 37:37.795
You're a pal.

37:41.320 --> 37:42.549
But... Oh, Maya.

37:46.080 --> 37:48.595
You mixed-up weirdos
got lucky today,

37:48.800 --> 37:50.632
but tomorrow, you're...

37:51.480 --> 37:54.871
ow, ow, ow... out of here.

38:00.720 --> 38:04.350
"My name's Violet
and I think I'm so super cool,

38:04.520 --> 38:07.319
with my purple hair
and my fancy pollen."

38:07.480 --> 38:08.391
Ugh!

38:24.600 --> 38:25.477
Maya?

38:25.680 --> 38:28.912
Come back, please?

38:30.840 --> 38:31.830
Hmm.

38:34.160 --> 38:36.675
I don't think your new pal
likes me.

38:36.840 --> 38:38.957
Violet's nice.
Give her a chance.

38:39.120 --> 38:43.637
Nice? She called Team Poppy
a mixed up bunch of weirdos.

38:44.160 --> 38:46.880
I'm sure that was a...
compliment.

38:49.800 --> 38:53.589
Hey, didn't you say
that every bug has a talent?

38:53.920 --> 38:57.470
Well maybe our talent
is being...

38:58.080 --> 38:59.560
different.

39:08.120 --> 39:10.157
Hey, Bee friends forever?

39:18.200 --> 39:20.078
I'm glad you're here with me,
Willi.

39:20.440 --> 39:21.556
Me too, Maya.

39:22.720 --> 39:23.995
Me too.

39:39.920 --> 39:41.718
Sir, yes, sir!

39:44.240 --> 39:46.152
Wakey-wakey, Team Poppy.

39:46.400 --> 39:48.995
Your training session
starts now!

39:49.160 --> 39:50.992
Huh? What are you talking about?

39:51.200 --> 39:52.839
Yesterday was just a fluke,
Maya!

39:53.000 --> 39:54.719
I'm outta here. Excuse me.

39:54.880 --> 39:56.633
- Wait, you can't just give up.
- Pardon me.

39:56.800 --> 39:59.395
What's the point of even trying?

39:59.680 --> 40:01.353
Don't you get it, Maya?

40:01.600 --> 40:05.355
Beegood only picked us because
we're hopeless at everything.

40:05.520 --> 40:06.636
That's not true.

40:07.000 --> 40:09.799
Spinder, I want you to catch
this pebble with your web.

40:09.960 --> 40:13.112
Really? Sounds kinda stupid.

40:13.280 --> 40:14.873
But okay.

40:15.040 --> 40:16.793
I know you can do it. Ready?

40:17.360 --> 40:18.157
No.

40:30.080 --> 40:33.471
It's raining in my soul
right now.

40:34.400 --> 40:36.676
You just need a little
more practice, that's all.

40:36.840 --> 40:37.796
What about you, Craig?

40:38.000 --> 40:40.515
Show us what great scuttlers
roaches are.

40:41.040 --> 40:42.554
Yahoo!

40:44.200 --> 40:47.113
That was great! You didn't
even notice the roof was dirty.

40:49.680 --> 40:52.400
Your turn, Bedford.
What's your special skill?

40:52.600 --> 40:53.875
I like to dance.

40:54.040 --> 40:56.271
Ooh, and singing.
I like singing best.

40:56.440 --> 40:59.956
Maya, it's no use,
we're just not good enough.

41:00.280 --> 41:01.919
Come on, sleepy bugs!

41:02.080 --> 41:04.311
We've got two hours
until the Games start.

41:04.520 --> 41:06.955
If we wanna win it,
we gotta be ready!

41:07.160 --> 41:09.880
Oh no, she's doing it again.

42:39.200 --> 42:42.557
Welcome to Willow Tree Washout!

42:42.880 --> 42:45.759
Teams will race to the top
of the tree,

42:46.080 --> 42:48.834
avoiding the falling dew drops.

42:49.040 --> 42:54.274
Only one member from each team
needs to cross the finish line.

42:54.640 --> 42:56.393
Uh... it's too high.

42:56.560 --> 42:59.359
Don't be afraid, Bedford,
I'll be right here with you.

42:59.560 --> 43:01.199
And remember
your training, guys.

43:01.480 --> 43:02.436
What training?

43:02.640 --> 43:04.438
- You remember any training?
- Nope.

43:04.640 --> 43:06.313
Ready, set...

43:08.760 --> 43:10.240
Go.

43:10.480 --> 43:12.790
- Go! Go! Go!
- Let's go!

43:27.280 --> 43:30.273
And Team Tropolis
taking the early lead.

43:31.280 --> 43:32.919
Hmm?

43:36.280 --> 43:38.192
There goes part of their team.

43:39.720 --> 43:42.519
Oh, the Aphids have
three members left.

43:42.760 --> 43:43.796
Faster, guys!

43:45.720 --> 43:48.633
We're not gonna make it!
I gotta get going.

43:48.840 --> 43:50.832
What? You can't leave us.

43:51.880 --> 43:53.473
I have to.

43:54.240 --> 43:55.390
Maya, wait!

43:55.560 --> 43:57.313
Maya, what are you doing?

43:59.880 --> 44:02.714
Looks like Maya
has cut her team loose.

44:03.040 --> 44:04.190
To victory!

44:07.320 --> 44:09.039
This is fun. Hey, how you doing?

44:09.840 --> 44:11.069
Woohoo!

44:18.600 --> 44:19.590
No!

44:20.960 --> 44:24.112
Team Poppy
continue to struggle.

44:24.320 --> 44:26.835
Thanks for your help, Maya.

44:30.840 --> 44:33.309
Team Tropolis
down to their captain.

44:46.960 --> 44:49.031
Too slow, meadow bug!

44:54.680 --> 44:56.160
Yay!

44:56.400 --> 44:58.073
Violet, shake your stinger!

45:09.040 --> 45:11.236
First place, Aphid Gorge.

45:14.800 --> 45:17.918
Second, my snail-footed
daughter Violet

45:18.080 --> 45:19.833
and her Team Tropolis.

45:20.720 --> 45:22.120
And third...

45:22.720 --> 45:25.440
Ugh! Team Poppy Meadow.

45:26.040 --> 45:28.874
Woohoo! Yes!

45:29.080 --> 45:30.480
Sorry, Daddy.

45:30.800 --> 45:33.474
Mm. I should hope so.

45:38.400 --> 45:40.995
We did it! We did it!
We made it through!

45:41.160 --> 45:43.277
You made it through.

45:43.440 --> 45:45.238
What? What do you mean?

45:45.920 --> 45:47.115
Where are you going?

45:48.160 --> 45:51.471
You left us behind.
So much for teamwork.

45:53.720 --> 45:56.110
But... but I had to.

46:04.280 --> 46:07.000
Sweet honey cakes!
We're in the last three.

46:07.200 --> 46:10.432
Sweet honey cakes!
They're in the last three?

46:11.400 --> 46:13.357
Your daughter
better not fail me, Beegood.

46:14.880 --> 46:17.315
The pride of Buzztropolis
is at stake.

46:19.000 --> 46:21.913
Yes, Your Majesty,
of course, of course.

46:31.840 --> 46:33.832
Hello? Everyone?

46:34.320 --> 46:36.073
- I'm sorry that I left...
- Maya?

46:36.800 --> 46:37.950
It's okay.

46:38.960 --> 46:40.474
It's not okay.

46:40.760 --> 46:42.956
I shouldn't have buzzed off
on everyone.

46:43.840 --> 46:46.400
It's just if I don't win
the Games...

46:46.560 --> 46:49.359
The Empress will take
your honey, Willi told us.

46:49.640 --> 46:50.676
- Yep.
- Mm-hm.

46:50.840 --> 46:53.196
Hmm.

46:53.840 --> 46:56.674
Maya, why didn't you
say something?

46:57.640 --> 46:59.233
I don't know.

47:00.920 --> 47:01.671
I...

47:03.000 --> 47:04.480
I didn't want to worry you.

47:05.440 --> 47:06.760
But we're here for you, Maya.

47:06.920 --> 47:07.797
- I'm here.
- I'm here.

47:08.000 --> 47:08.956
- You're here.
- They're here.

47:09.120 --> 47:10.349
- He's here.
- He's here too.

47:10.560 --> 47:12.233
We're here for you.

47:14.080 --> 47:16.436
Yeah, that's what teams are for.

47:18.720 --> 47:19.676
You're right.

47:21.000 --> 47:21.911
Team?

47:30.880 --> 47:33.156
Go Team Poppy!

47:45.080 --> 47:50.030
Welcome to the Maze
of the Megabeast!

47:51.120 --> 47:53.396
Teams will have to navigate
their way

47:53.560 --> 47:55.711
through the many paths
of the maze

47:55.880 --> 47:59.078
to the exit at the north end.

47:59.800 --> 48:02.872
Flying is not permitted
in this event.

48:03.040 --> 48:04.520
And beware.

48:05.200 --> 48:09.240
Somewhere within
lurks the mysterious...

48:10.080 --> 48:11.833
Megabeast.

48:12.000 --> 48:15.391
Wake the beast at your peril.

48:15.720 --> 48:18.713
Racers, take your marks.

48:19.480 --> 48:20.391
Go!

48:23.680 --> 48:25.000
- Eat...
- Our...

48:25.160 --> 48:26.230
Dust!

48:27.520 --> 48:28.590
Willi, wait!

48:29.200 --> 48:30.919
Spinder, spin me some web.

48:31.080 --> 48:33.549
- We need to stay together.
- Huh?

48:35.680 --> 48:36.796
This way, team.

48:47.920 --> 48:49.195
Oh no!

48:49.840 --> 48:52.480
Where are they?
Maya?

48:52.920 --> 48:54.479
Maya?

48:57.680 --> 48:58.796
This way!

48:59.120 --> 49:02.477
Um, Violet, I think the exit's
at the north end.

49:02.640 --> 49:04.154
So, since the sun's...

49:04.360 --> 49:06.431
Just let me do the thinking,
okay?

49:16.240 --> 49:17.469
Where's Willi?

49:17.720 --> 49:19.951
Hmm? Hang on a minute.

49:22.600 --> 49:23.636
Maya?

49:25.040 --> 49:26.315
Maya, are you there?

49:30.960 --> 49:33.714
Maya?

49:34.560 --> 49:36.870
Maya?

49:37.040 --> 49:40.238
Willi? Willi! Willi!

49:46.720 --> 49:48.473
Willi! Over here!

49:49.320 --> 49:52.154
I think we found the Megabeast.

49:52.600 --> 49:55.434
Careful, Willi, don't wake it.

49:55.920 --> 49:56.717
What?

49:59.200 --> 50:02.238
Whoa!

50:07.240 --> 50:09.835
It's not as scary as it looks.

50:13.560 --> 50:16.712
It sounds like someone's
found the Megabeast.

50:27.760 --> 50:29.672
Follow that Megabeast!

50:32.400 --> 50:35.120
I don't understand.
We should be there now.

50:35.280 --> 50:37.749
Um, Violet, that's what I was
trying to tell you.

50:37.920 --> 50:39.434
If we just go north then...

50:39.680 --> 50:43.230
I have had it with this team!
All you do is slow me down!

50:43.400 --> 50:45.119
Uh, can you guys hear that?

50:45.280 --> 50:48.000
The only thing you should
listen to is the sound of my...

50:59.720 --> 51:00.551
Jump, Willi!

51:02.040 --> 51:03.599
Willi!

51:04.640 --> 51:07.109
Team Poppy
are first to cross the line.

51:07.280 --> 51:10.000
We made it!

51:10.800 --> 51:11.870
Yeah!

51:12.600 --> 51:15.160
Not... so... fast!

51:16.960 --> 51:21.432
I think you'll find I beat them.

51:21.640 --> 51:24.678
Actually, it was first team
over the line.

51:25.920 --> 51:28.640
And it's Team Tropolis
in second place.

51:28.840 --> 51:32.390
No! I am Team Tropolis!

51:32.600 --> 51:36.116
Those slug bugs
are nothing without me!

51:36.320 --> 51:37.754
- Huh?
- Excuse me?

51:38.080 --> 51:40.720
- Hmph!
- Chelsea, Sandra?

51:40.960 --> 51:42.553
I'm your captain!

51:43.600 --> 51:45.876
Daddy, wait. I... I can explain!

51:46.280 --> 51:48.715
Save it! Excuses are for losers!

51:48.920 --> 51:50.912
I thought my daughter
was a winner!

51:51.640 --> 51:52.676
But I am!

51:53.440 --> 51:54.430
I am a winner.

51:54.640 --> 51:57.280
Team Poppy
and Team Tropolis

51:57.440 --> 52:01.275
are our grand finalists.

52:01.440 --> 52:04.194
This calls for a celebration!

52:08.320 --> 52:10.471
Team Poppy?

52:10.800 --> 52:13.793
How could you let this happen,
Beegood?

52:14.040 --> 52:15.713
This is absolutely...

52:15.880 --> 52:17.473
...wonderful news!

52:18.360 --> 52:19.396
Uh...

52:20.000 --> 52:23.038
Pack your pollen, Crawley!
We're off to the Honey Games!

52:23.240 --> 52:25.038
Hurray!

52:30.120 --> 52:31.440
Nice spread!

52:35.400 --> 52:38.199
♪ Dance, dance, dance, dance ♪

52:38.440 --> 52:40.318
Maya, don't let her get to you.

52:40.760 --> 52:42.956
Yeah, she'll just get you
in trouble.

52:43.320 --> 52:46.677
Come on, let's enjoy the party.

52:46.840 --> 52:48.638
- Oh yeah.
- Hey, Flip!

52:49.200 --> 52:50.429
Hi, Maya!

52:52.280 --> 52:54.431
Yeah.

52:54.600 --> 52:55.954
Mind if I cut in?

52:56.120 --> 52:58.351
Yes.

52:59.040 --> 53:00.315
Come on, Willi.

53:01.920 --> 53:04.230
Hey!

53:06.160 --> 53:08.629
We're friends, right, Willi?

53:08.800 --> 53:12.999
- We're friends?
- Of course we're friends, silly!

53:15.960 --> 53:17.997
And friends help
each other, yeah?

53:19.960 --> 53:21.440
And I gave you
all that pollen...

53:21.600 --> 53:22.590
...remember?

53:23.760 --> 53:26.070
Hi, Willi. He's dancing with me.

53:26.240 --> 53:29.631
Uh-uh. He's dancing with me.

53:29.840 --> 53:31.797
No, he's dancing with us!

53:32.080 --> 53:33.150
What?

53:34.600 --> 53:36.637
Why don't you leave us alone?

53:36.840 --> 53:38.513
Because you don't belong here.

53:38.720 --> 53:40.916
The Honey Games
are for the best of the best.

53:41.080 --> 53:43.549
And you loser bugs are a joke.

53:43.760 --> 53:46.832
We'll see who's laughing
after the grand final tomorrow.

53:47.040 --> 53:49.430
Puh-lease.

53:49.600 --> 53:52.638
You mixed up meadow bugs
don't stand a chance.

53:52.800 --> 53:55.998
Why can't you just play fair
and leave Team Poppy alone?

53:57.920 --> 53:59.354
Tell you what.

53:59.360 --> 54:02.432
I'll leave your precious
Team Poppy alone,

54:02.680 --> 54:07.277
if you can beat me in a race
down Slug Hill, right now.

54:07.880 --> 54:10.076
No. It's out of bounds.

54:10.280 --> 54:14.194
I'm really going to enjoy
eating all your summer honey.

54:15.520 --> 54:19.230
Okay. I'll do it.

54:23.280 --> 54:24.919
Let's make it interesting.

54:25.360 --> 54:27.875
- Or are you a scaredy-bug?
- Hmph!

54:35.560 --> 54:38.439
Sandra will call out
when we pass the finish line.

54:43.920 --> 54:46.037
Ready, set, go!

54:59.600 --> 55:01.637
Maya and Violet
are racing down Slug Hill!

55:03.120 --> 55:04.395
Oh no.

55:08.000 --> 55:10.560
See you at the finish line,
loser bug!

55:10.720 --> 55:12.359
Not if I see you first!

55:19.640 --> 55:21.518
Am I at the finish line yet?

55:23.880 --> 55:25.633
Oh, dear!

55:25.840 --> 55:26.910
Oh, Maya!

55:31.800 --> 55:36.511
Who... is... responsible...
for this?

55:43.640 --> 55:44.869
You!

55:45.040 --> 55:48.112
But I wasn't! I mean... I'm...
I didn't!

55:50.040 --> 55:52.600
Violet tricked me, again!

55:53.360 --> 55:56.273
Silence!
You broke the Honey Cup!

55:56.640 --> 55:58.996
I warned you, little bee.

55:59.240 --> 56:03.393
You are hereby expelled
from the Honey Games!

56:03.560 --> 56:05.438
No, please.

56:05.600 --> 56:06.670
Out!

56:09.560 --> 56:10.789
Oh no.

56:19.600 --> 56:20.351
Maya?

56:23.280 --> 56:24.191
What happened?

56:25.120 --> 56:26.839
Violet happened!

56:27.200 --> 56:29.078
She got me kicked out
of the Games.

56:29.280 --> 56:30.714
What? She wouldn't.

56:31.080 --> 56:34.152
Can't you see
what she's doing?

56:35.120 --> 56:37.715
I'm sure it's just
a misunderstanding.

56:37.880 --> 56:38.950
No, Willi.

56:39.920 --> 56:41.240
It's up to you now.

56:41.600 --> 56:45.560
You have to stay here
and save our honey.

56:47.120 --> 56:48.474
Maya, wait!

57:05.520 --> 57:06.476
Ugh.

57:28.200 --> 57:28.997
Flip.

57:29.960 --> 57:31.076
Hello there, little miss.

57:31.400 --> 57:34.472
I thought I'd find you out here,
gazing at the stars.

57:35.480 --> 57:36.834
They...

57:37.640 --> 57:40.917
- kicked me out.
- Mm, so I heard.

57:41.280 --> 57:43.590
Come on, sit down,
tell old Flip about it.

57:47.400 --> 57:50.234
Flip, I broke the Honey Cup.

57:50.520 --> 57:52.512
But... but the race
down Slug Hill

57:52.680 --> 57:54.080
wasn't even my idea.

57:54.840 --> 57:59.835
You went out of bounds.
That's against the rules, Maya.

58:00.280 --> 58:03.432
Violet breaks the rules
all the time.

58:03.800 --> 58:06.269
Yes, but you're not Violet.

58:07.200 --> 58:11.080
I just wanted to make
things right.

58:12.160 --> 58:15.631
I know, you wanna fix
all the problems in the meadow.

58:15.920 --> 58:18.355
But you can't do it
all on your own, little buzzer.

58:18.760 --> 58:22.037
You need to slow down
and listen to other bugs.

58:24.960 --> 58:27.839
Okay.
I'm listening, Flip.

58:28.320 --> 58:30.516
Maya, you gotta remember.

58:31.040 --> 58:33.999
Good little bees don't blame
others for their mistakes.

58:34.360 --> 58:35.760
So, let's think back.

58:36.080 --> 58:37.639
Where did all
your troubles begin?

58:38.800 --> 58:41.793
I didn't listen to the Queen...

58:42.560 --> 58:45.394
and I messed everything up
when I went to see the Empress.

58:45.760 --> 58:48.559
Well, a bug that wants
to make things right

58:48.840 --> 58:51.719
would take responsibility
for the part they've played.

58:52.480 --> 58:53.391
Don't you think?

58:54.120 --> 58:57.909
Hmm. They would.
Thanks, Flip.

58:58.760 --> 58:59.989
Good luck, Maya.

59:17.440 --> 59:21.229
Ladybugs and gentlebees!

59:21.520 --> 59:27.152
Welcome
to the Honey Games Grand Final!

59:30.400 --> 59:35.555
May I proudly present
Her Majesty,

59:35.880 --> 59:40.238
the Empress of Buzztropolis!

59:42.240 --> 59:45.631
In our final event,
the remaining two teams

59:45.800 --> 59:48.395
must navigate
the Dragonfly Rush,

59:48.600 --> 59:50.114
and the Mudsucker Muddle

59:50.320 --> 59:54.553
and then climb the summit
of Mount Stumpy!

59:56.840 --> 01:00:00.311
The competitors must then
<i>retrieve the ruby pollen</i>

01:00:00.480 --> 01:00:03.120
from the Nani Nani Orchid!

01:00:03.440 --> 01:00:07.400
The first team to cross the line
with the ruby pollen,

01:00:08.560 --> 01:00:10.791
will win the Honey Cup!

01:00:13.920 --> 01:00:19.791
The losing team will receive
these novelty mugs!

01:00:21.720 --> 01:00:26.237
And now, introducing
our first grand finalists...

01:00:26.880 --> 01:00:28.917
- the favorites...
- Mm-hm.

01:00:29.080 --> 01:00:32.312
...Team Tropolis!

01:00:36.720 --> 01:00:39.918
Team Poppy are gonna wish
they stayed in their swamp.

01:00:40.080 --> 01:00:44.757
And this year's
surprising wild card...

01:00:45.440 --> 01:00:48.717
Team Poppy!

01:00:52.520 --> 01:00:54.398
Go, Poppy Meadow!

01:00:55.960 --> 01:00:59.158
- Oh, great! No one turned up.
- Oh, Arnie?

01:00:59.400 --> 01:01:01.596
Yes, sir?

01:01:01.800 --> 01:01:05.430
Oh, they turned up.
Everybody's here.

01:01:06.720 --> 01:01:08.040
Where's Maya?

01:01:11.520 --> 01:01:12.999
She's been disqualified.

01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:16.391
Disqualified?
On what grounds?

01:01:16.720 --> 01:01:18.837
Oh, Beatrice, once again,

01:01:19.160 --> 01:01:22.915
you and your hive
have proven to be a disgrace.

01:01:23.280 --> 01:01:25.192
- But...
- Miss Empress?

01:01:26.760 --> 01:01:29.480
Oh.
Little meadow bug.

01:01:30.200 --> 01:01:31.793
You just don't give up, do you?

01:01:32.120 --> 01:01:34.157
Please, hear me out.

01:01:34.440 --> 01:01:36.193
It's not the Queen's fault.

01:01:36.360 --> 01:01:39.319
Oh.
Really?

01:01:39.920 --> 01:01:41.752
Then who's fault is it?

01:01:43.040 --> 01:01:44.156
Mine.

01:01:44.440 --> 01:01:46.113
I'm the one
who came to Buzztropolis

01:01:46.280 --> 01:01:47.953
and made a mess of everything.

01:01:48.440 --> 01:01:50.397
I didn't listen to you,
Your Majesty.

01:01:51.600 --> 01:01:52.829
And in the Games...

01:01:53.720 --> 01:01:57.111
I didn't listen to my team.
They trusted me and...

01:01:58.120 --> 01:01:59.759
and I let them down.

01:02:01.080 --> 01:02:02.355
I'm so sorry.

01:02:04.560 --> 01:02:07.200
And I'm so sorry to you,
Miss Empress,

01:02:07.600 --> 01:02:09.557
for not showing you respect.

01:02:10.880 --> 01:02:13.714
Please don't punish our hive
because of me.

01:02:15.640 --> 01:02:16.551
Give her a chance!

01:02:29.320 --> 01:02:31.039
How touching.

01:02:31.360 --> 01:02:33.920
Such honesty should be rewarded.

01:02:34.640 --> 01:02:37.997
Little bee, I'm going to give
you a second chance

01:02:38.160 --> 01:02:39.753
to compete in the final.

01:02:44.320 --> 01:02:45.720
But if you lose,

01:02:46.040 --> 01:02:48.999
we will still take
all your summer honey.

01:02:50.920 --> 01:02:53.230
This summer, next summer,

01:02:53.400 --> 01:02:55.517
and every summer after that.

01:02:55.880 --> 01:02:56.996
Never!

01:02:57.160 --> 01:02:59.595
I should've stood up to you
a long time ago.

01:03:01.960 --> 01:03:05.476
We accept your challenge.
And we will win!

01:03:06.960 --> 01:03:08.440
You can do it, Maya.

01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:10.320
No.

01:03:11.120 --> 01:03:12.190
We can do it.

01:03:13.200 --> 01:03:14.554
That's what friends do, right?

01:03:15.320 --> 01:03:16.356
Maya?

01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:19.640
You're the first bug
that's ever believed in us.

01:03:23.160 --> 01:03:24.310
Oh, group hug!

01:03:29.480 --> 01:03:31.676
Right, group hug!

01:03:33.440 --> 01:03:34.635
Is she serious?

01:03:35.760 --> 01:03:38.514
Competitors,
to the starting line.

01:03:40.160 --> 01:03:42.914
- What are you, petal?
- I'm a winner, Daddy.

01:03:43.080 --> 01:03:45.037
Right. And what do winners do?

01:03:45.200 --> 01:03:47.590
They win, whatever it takes.

01:03:47.800 --> 01:03:51.032
Exactly.
When you get to Mount Stumpy,

01:03:51.200 --> 01:03:53.237
take the secret tunnel
on the right.

01:03:53.520 --> 01:03:55.432
What? What if we get caught?

01:03:55.640 --> 01:03:57.279
I'm the Games Master,
sweet leaf,

01:03:57.440 --> 01:03:58.715
you won't get caught.

01:04:01.080 --> 01:04:03.151
Racers, take your marks!

01:04:11.360 --> 01:04:12.350
Get set!

01:04:23.560 --> 01:04:25.552
- Let's buzz these bugs!
- Ow!

01:04:28.080 --> 01:04:31.710
Don't grab their feelers.
Steer by leaning your body.

01:04:31.920 --> 01:04:32.751
Come on!

01:04:38.520 --> 01:04:39.670
Let's go!

01:04:40.680 --> 01:04:42.717
I'm flying!

01:04:43.480 --> 01:04:46.154
Hey, kid, let go!

01:04:49.520 --> 01:04:51.512
Let go of their feelers!

01:04:51.680 --> 01:04:53.273
Go! Move move move!

01:04:57.800 --> 01:04:58.950
Let's go!

01:04:59.160 --> 01:05:01.959
Team Poppy
are taking an early lead!

01:05:02.120 --> 01:05:03.236
Yes!

01:05:03.680 --> 01:05:07.276
But Team Tropolis are
not giving up without a fight.

01:05:16.160 --> 01:05:17.276
Whoa!

01:05:19.480 --> 01:05:22.154
Too slow!

01:05:24.080 --> 01:05:26.720
Should've stayed in bed, bugs!

01:05:31.400 --> 01:05:32.436
Spinder, save him!

01:05:33.600 --> 01:05:34.511
You can do it!

01:05:45.280 --> 01:05:47.192
Spinder, you saved me.

01:05:47.400 --> 01:05:48.880
I did it. I did it!

01:05:49.040 --> 01:05:51.396
Go, Spinder!

01:05:52.600 --> 01:05:53.511
Thank you, Spinder.

01:06:04.840 --> 01:06:07.514
And as they come up
to the Mudsucker Muddle,

01:06:07.720 --> 01:06:10.952
it's Team Tropolis,
a bee's knee in front.

01:06:20.160 --> 01:06:24.200
Ugh! So dirty.
I can't, Maya. I can't.

01:06:24.440 --> 01:06:25.476
Let's help him.

01:06:26.760 --> 01:06:28.240
Come on, buddy.

01:06:28.880 --> 01:06:29.791
That's it!

01:06:35.320 --> 01:06:37.437
- Craig!
- That's not good.

01:06:42.160 --> 01:06:44.720
I'm dirty and muddy and...

01:06:45.240 --> 01:06:47.516
I love it!

01:06:49.680 --> 01:06:52.434
I love it!

01:06:53.800 --> 01:06:55.951
I am in control.

01:06:57.680 --> 01:06:59.080
I'm in control!

01:06:59.680 --> 01:07:01.433
I'm in control!

01:07:01.720 --> 01:07:03.234
I'm not in control!

01:07:03.400 --> 01:07:07.440
Frozen aphid pops!
It's raining sky ice!

01:07:11.480 --> 01:07:13.392
Everyone, under there!

01:07:17.360 --> 01:07:18.476
Maya?

01:07:20.080 --> 01:07:21.753
Maya!

01:07:23.960 --> 01:07:25.030
Where's Willi?

01:07:29.040 --> 01:07:29.871
Wait!

01:07:44.400 --> 01:07:45.231
This way.

01:07:45.400 --> 01:07:47.471
It's a bit dark.

01:07:47.680 --> 01:07:49.034
Get in there, wobble grubs!

01:07:54.280 --> 01:07:55.077
Huh?

01:07:56.680 --> 01:07:57.750
Violet!

01:07:58.840 --> 01:07:59.910
What are you doing?

01:08:00.440 --> 01:08:01.999
We're winning, Willi.

01:08:02.240 --> 01:08:04.630
- And you're gonna help us.
- Huh?

01:08:04.840 --> 01:08:07.150
Tell Maya
you've got a sore wing.

01:08:07.520 --> 01:08:09.113
That'll slow her down.

01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:10.831
What?

01:08:11.440 --> 01:08:13.636
You'd do it for me,
wouldn't you?

01:08:15.720 --> 01:08:17.712
Thought so.

01:08:24.920 --> 01:08:25.910
Willi!

01:08:27.319 --> 01:08:28.276
What's wrong?

01:08:29.200 --> 01:08:30.189
I'm hurt.

01:08:31.319 --> 01:08:35.029
I'm hurt that Violet wanted me
to lie to my best friend.

01:08:35.680 --> 01:08:37.113
They've taken a short cut!

01:08:37.279 --> 01:08:39.840
Oh, the cheeky cheaters.

01:08:40.520 --> 01:08:43.433
We don't have a chance!
We don't have a chance!

01:08:43.640 --> 01:08:47.600
We don't need a chance.
We've got each other.

01:08:47.760 --> 01:08:49.956
Let's win this, fair and square.

01:08:50.120 --> 01:08:51.634
Oh, yeah.

01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:54.117
- Come on.
- Everybody, follow her!

01:08:54.279 --> 01:08:55.430
Let's go, guys.

01:08:58.359 --> 01:09:00.875
Violet do we have
to go this way?

01:09:01.240 --> 01:09:05.234
- It's so creepy!
- Just be quiet and follow me!

01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:26.310
Spread out,
the orchid's up here somewhere!

01:09:27.160 --> 01:09:29.470
- let's go.
- We've got no chance!

01:09:32.200 --> 01:09:33.270
We're never gonna find it.

01:09:33.560 --> 01:09:35.438
- You're so negative.
- Arnie! We found it!

01:09:35.680 --> 01:09:37.558
- Wow!
- Are you looking at this?

01:09:37.800 --> 01:09:39.951
Yeah, and it's beautiful.

01:09:42.520 --> 01:09:44.671
Barney, we found it!
I'll get Maya.

01:09:44.840 --> 01:09:46.513
You wait here,
and don't touch anything!

01:09:48.240 --> 01:09:51.471
Maya! Up here! We found the...!

01:09:55.320 --> 01:09:58.074
What's he saying?
I can't hear him.

01:10:01.600 --> 01:10:04.718
I speak sign language.
He says he's found the flower.

01:10:05.760 --> 01:10:08.355
This way, everybody,
single file, or no file at all.

01:10:08.520 --> 01:10:10.239
This way to see the flower.

01:10:10.440 --> 01:10:12.079
Whoa!

01:10:12.280 --> 01:10:14.590
I thought there'd be,
like, more.

01:10:18.600 --> 01:10:20.637
- What?
- Oh Barney, you didn't!

01:10:25.320 --> 01:10:26.595
We did it!

01:10:26.800 --> 01:10:28.154
Whoa!

01:10:28.320 --> 01:10:30.471
Uh, we should get going!

01:10:30.640 --> 01:10:31.676
Help!

01:10:32.360 --> 01:10:33.237
Huh?

01:10:33.920 --> 01:10:35.957
Hey, hey, that's Violet.
It sounds like she's in trouble!

01:10:36.120 --> 01:10:37.600
Help!

01:10:38.800 --> 01:10:42.510
- But we're so close to winning!
- And what if she's tricking us?

01:10:43.360 --> 01:10:44.555
What if she's not?

01:10:46.520 --> 01:10:48.193
Help!

01:10:50.760 --> 01:10:54.549
Got ourselves
in a sticky situation, have we?

01:10:54.760 --> 01:10:56.911
Someone do something!

01:10:59.600 --> 01:11:01.796
Hey! Let them go!

01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:05.755
Be gone, raggedy bugs.

01:11:05.920 --> 01:11:08.754
My dinner's getting cold.

01:11:08.960 --> 01:11:10.679
We have to do something!

01:11:16.120 --> 01:11:18.635
Oh, you naughty bugs!

01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:21.310
Arnie, Barney,
create a diversion!

01:11:21.480 --> 01:11:22.755
Ten-four, Sergeant.
I mean nurse!

01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:24.150
I mean coach! 10-4, coach!

01:11:24.440 --> 01:11:26.397
Diverting a creation now!

01:11:26.840 --> 01:11:28.911
- Hut! Hut!
- Spinder, sling that web!

01:11:36.160 --> 01:11:38.595
Craig, Bedford,
scuttle and chomp!

01:11:38.600 --> 01:11:40.751
Scuttle and chomp!

01:11:46.760 --> 01:11:47.989
Help them out!

01:11:52.680 --> 01:11:56.230
Nowhere to run now!

01:11:56.400 --> 01:11:59.393

01:11:59.680 --> 01:12:02.639

Oh, so lovely.

01:12:37.840 --> 01:12:40.560
Wow! You're amazing, Bedford!

01:12:42.040 --> 01:12:43.269
Yes, I know.

01:12:46.760 --> 01:12:48.240
Why did you save me?

01:12:49.080 --> 01:12:50.150
You were winning.

01:12:50.320 --> 01:12:52.232
Because you needed our help.

01:12:52.560 --> 01:12:55.871
And that's what real friends do,
they help each other.

01:12:56.080 --> 01:12:57.992
They pick you up
when you're down.

01:12:59.240 --> 01:13:01.675
- Put me down! Stop!
- Okay. Whoa!

01:13:08.200 --> 01:13:09.839
I'm sorry I was mean to you.

01:13:11.160 --> 01:13:13.391
- It's okay.
- No, it's not.

01:13:14.480 --> 01:13:15.914
I'm really sorry.

01:13:16.400 --> 01:13:18.960
Thanks, Violet.

01:13:19.160 --> 01:13:21.720
Come on,
we've got a race to finish!

01:13:22.680 --> 01:13:23.796
You're on.

01:13:25.280 --> 01:13:26.999
Oh, the thunder's passed,

01:13:27.160 --> 01:13:30.676
but these two teams
are still storming on!

01:13:31.640 --> 01:13:35.429
And who will be the first
back into the arena?

01:13:36.680 --> 01:13:38.319
Oh, here they come now!

01:13:38.480 --> 01:13:41.393
And it's both teams
neck and neck.

01:13:41.600 --> 01:13:44.115
How exciting!

01:13:48.960 --> 01:13:55.878
Woohoo! Team Poppy have won it,
for the first time ever!

01:13:56.360 --> 01:13:57.919
Team Poppy?

01:13:58.120 --> 01:14:00.237
Violet, what have you done!?

01:14:00.440 --> 01:14:03.160
- Go, Poppy!
- Go Team Poppy!

01:14:06.680 --> 01:14:10.799
A-ha! They do not have
the ruby pollen!

01:14:10.960 --> 01:14:13.236
No pollen, no victory!

01:14:13.400 --> 01:14:15.551
- Daddy, enough.
- What?

01:14:16.160 --> 01:14:17.560
We cheated.

01:14:18.040 --> 01:14:19.474
I cheated.

01:14:21.120 --> 01:14:23.840
- Boo!
- They cheated?

01:14:27.680 --> 01:14:29.512
Team Poppy saved us!

01:14:30.440 --> 01:14:32.079
They deserve to win.

01:14:32.560 --> 01:14:34.677
No they do not.

01:14:34.880 --> 01:14:38.476
Hey, Beegood! I've got one thing
to say to you...

01:14:38.640 --> 01:14:40.996
Use your words, Barney.
Use your words.

01:14:41.560 --> 01:14:42.596
Ugh!

01:14:43.320 --> 01:14:47.917
Oh! The Nani Nani pollen!
They have done it!

01:14:50.400 --> 01:14:53.040
They won! They won!

01:14:53.200 --> 01:14:54.156
Quiet.

01:14:55.280 --> 01:14:56.111
Quiet!

01:14:57.080 --> 01:14:58.355
Silence!

01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:00.229
Please.

01:15:00.720 --> 01:15:03.315
Shh.

01:15:03.480 --> 01:15:04.391
Quiet.

01:15:05.200 --> 01:15:09.558
Catherine, Team Poppy have won,
fair and square.

01:15:09.720 --> 01:15:14.192
I say who wins.
I am the Empress and I...

01:15:14.400 --> 01:15:18.713
Yes, you are the Empress.
And I am your sister.

01:15:21.200 --> 01:15:22.793
When is enough, enough?

01:15:24.880 --> 01:15:29.079
You don't want our honey.
You have everything you need.

01:15:30.720 --> 01:15:32.040
Look around.

01:15:33.520 --> 01:15:35.239
Do what you know is right.

01:15:44.200 --> 01:15:46.351
I can't believe
I'm saying this...

01:15:47.600 --> 01:15:49.353
Team Poppy wins.

01:15:49.600 --> 01:15:51.876
Yes! Woohoo!

01:15:53.480 --> 01:15:54.709
We won!

01:15:55.560 --> 01:15:57.279
No! Your Majesty!

01:15:57.440 --> 01:15:59.193
