Nice to meet you.

01:03:23.300 --> 01:03:26.303
So exactly how long has it been
since you last saw your son?

01:03:26.428 --> 01:03:30.098
Seven days. I went to the cabin
and there was no phone, wallet or keys,

01:03:30.224 --> 01:03:31.767
but everything else was there.

01:03:31.892 --> 01:03:35.395
And when you last heard from him,
you're sure he was here?

01:03:35.521 --> 01:03:38.524
Oh, yes, he left me a message.
I just... I didn't hear my phone.

01:03:38.649 --> 01:03:40.943
Okay, the first thing we do in this situation

01:03:41.068 --> 01:03:43.654
is file a missing-persons report
with the sheriff's office.

01:03:43.779 --> 01:03:46.698
If they don't have any leads,
I'll call Search and Rescue.

01:03:46.824 --> 01:03:48.909
The process will probably take a day or two.

01:03:49.034 --> 01:03:51.995
A...? No, no, Sarah, you don't understand.

01:03:52.120 --> 01:03:55.499
My son had a court date yesterday
that he missed. Okay?

01:03:55.624 --> 01:03:58.418
And that message he left me,
that was not normal,

01:03:58.544 --> 01:04:01.922
him telling me where he was
and what he was doing.

01:04:02.047 --> 01:04:05.133
He never does that, never.
You wanna know why he did it?

01:04:05.259 --> 01:04:08.720
Because he was letting me know
he was gonna make it to the court date,

01:04:08.846 --> 01:04:10.556
he was getting it together.

01:04:10.681 --> 01:04:14.226
So when I walk into that courtroom
and he is not there,

01:04:14.351 --> 01:04:19.356
and then I walk into that cabin
and see his clothes and old congealed food

01:04:19.481 --> 01:04:21.775
sitting there and no him?

01:04:21.900 --> 01:04:26.113

and if he is out there in that snow,

01:04:26.238 --> 01:04:28.156

01:25:09.772 --> 01:25:11.273
It's me.

01:25:14.401 --> 01:25:17.738
I don't really know what it is I wanna say.

01:25:21.408 --> 01:25:24.745
But I don't think I have too much time, so...

01:25:33.420 --> 01:25:37.133
I just want you to know
that I'm Okay with how this ends.

01:25:48.769 --> 01:25:51.564
And that I'm... I'm sorry.

01:25:56.735 --> 01:25:59.029
I'm sorry for everything.

01:26:07.371 --> 01:26:10.791
Turns out I'm a bit of a coward myself.

01:26:35.816 --> 01:26:37.443
It's funny.

01:26:41.113 --> 01:26:44.158
We only get to live life forward.

01:26:46.952 --> 01:26:50.623
But it never makes any sense
until we're looking back.

01:27:05.638 --> 01:27:08.891
I need you to know that...
we've cancelled the search and rescue.

01:27:09.016 --> 01:27:10.643
Why?

01:27:11.227 --> 01:27:14.063
We've now ruled this a body recovery.

01:27:21.654 --> 01:27:23.447
I love you, Mom.

01:28:54.371 --> 01:28:57.166
COREY:
Hey, uh, Sarah, we just had a signal pop up.

01:28:57.291 --> 01:29:00.044
- (MONITOR BEEPING)
- Wait, wait, hold on, hold on...

01:29:00.169 --> 01:29:02.671
A signal popped up and then it disappeared.

01:29:02.796 --> 01:29:05.632
- Where?
- Mount Widow's Peak. But it wasn't one of ours.

01:29:05.758 --> 01:29:07.468
- You sure?
- Yeah, positive.

01:29:07.593 --> 01:29:11.430
This is RM. We just picked up a signal
on Mount Widow's Peak.

01:29:25.110 --> 01:29:31.200
PILOT: <i>Coordinates are north 4-0-3-2-3-0.60,</i>

01:29:31.325 --> 01:29:37.081
<i>west 111-4-1-3.07.</i>

01:29:47.132 --> 01:29:48.884
Hold on, Eric.

01:30:09.113 --> 01:30:10.989
<i>Hey, got him!</i>

01:30:11.115 --> 01:30:13.075
Up on that ridge, two o'clock.

01:30:57.119 --> 01:30:59.288
(SOFTLY) Please, let him be alive.

01:30:59.413 --> 01:31:02.499
Please, let him be alive.
Please, let him be alive.

01:31:31.111 --> 01:31:33.155
PILOT: <i>Search and Rescue to base.</i>

01:31:33.280 --> 01:31:35.240
Two minutes out before landing.

01:31:48.337 --> 01:31:50.255
(HAUNTING MUSIC)

01:31:56.929 --> 01:31:59.848
You're gonna be okay, Eric.
You're gonna be okay.

01:32:33.090 --> 01:32:34.925
Eric.

01:32:39.012 --> 01:32:40.847
You're alive!

01:32:44.142 --> 01:32:46.436
I love you, sweetheart.

01:32:48.188 --> 01:32:51.441
ERIC: <i>Sometimes you get hit. You fall.</i>

01:32:51.567 --> 01:32:53.986
<i>You can't get back up.</i>

01:32:54.611 --> 01:32:56.572
<i>And you fall further.</i>

01:32:58.824 --> 01:33:02.202
<i>Before the mountain,
I couldn't see how far I'd fallen.</i>

01:33:03.412 --> 01:33:07.416
<i>Maybe that's what I had to go through
to finally live.</i>

01:33:10.210 --> 01:33:12.879
<i>Sometimes a part of yourself has to die,</i>

01:33:13.005 --> 01:33:17.718
maybe even the part you love most, before
you can realize what makes you whole,

01:33:17.843 --> 01:33:21.471
and clearly see that it's larger than us.

01:33:22.305 --> 01:33:23.473
If you're in the dark,

01:33:23.599 --> 01:33:28.228
get through it by seeing the invisible
so that you can do the impossible.

01:33:28.353 --> 01:33:31.565
Be responsible and accountable for yourself.

01:33:31.690 --> 01:33:33.358
Just fail forward.

01:33:33.483 --> 01:33:36.987
It'll all make sense when you see the light
at the break of dawn.

01:33:37.821 --> 01:33:42.492
I thank my mother for being there for me,
I thank my wife for loving me,

01:33:42.618 --> 01:33:45.162
I thank my kids for inspiring me.

01:33:45.287 --> 01:33:47.497
And now, by the grace of God,

01:33:47.623 --> 01:33:50.334
I can thank you, hockey, and the mountain,

01:33:50.459 --> 01:33:52.628
for giving me my hope.
