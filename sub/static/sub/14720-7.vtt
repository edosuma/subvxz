That's it.

Watch your back.

02:10.480 --> 02:11.360
Watch your back.

02:11.480 --> 02:14.320
When you're out on the streets.

I made it clear

I was the one to call you.

then you never called.

My luck has been bad eversince I teamed up with you,

- OK, OK.

02:49.120 --> 02:51.120
Well, maybe that's
about to change.

I'm pretty sure they're

Meeting the money?

I can think for--

03:01.600 --> 03:03.000
For what?

Why they're skipping thenext game and going bush.

That guy from Palmy

He said the same
thing about you.

Sod off, Rod.

What about her am I missing?

I'll come back in a while.

A whole month oftrying, and still no baby.

03:33.800 --> 03:36.440

it's not happening.

03:39.880 --> 03:40.640
I'm so sorry, love.

03:43.400 --> 03:45.040
So I said I
should check my lady

03:45.160 --> 03:48.320
bits at the doctor's and see ifeverything's doing its thing.

03:48.440 --> 03:51.720
But Phineas said it's upto God and not some doctor,

03:51.840 --> 03:53.760
and he doesn't likeother people playing God,

03:53.880 --> 03:56.200
especially if they'realso playing with my bits.

03:56.320 --> 03:58.720
And then he got old Phineas
and went into the shit

03:58.840 --> 04:00.360
and smashed the wall.

04:00.480 --> 04:03.400
And I know he's got a lot onhis mind with this baby thing,

04:03.520 --> 04:05.280
and also, he's got no money.

04:05.400 --> 04:08.280
The South African job'son hold and he's on edge.

04:08.400 --> 04:10.720
I get all that.

04:10.840 --> 04:13.440
But maybe I'm a terriblewife because I'm working all

04:13.560 --> 04:15.800
the time, and maybe
what God is really

04:15.920 --> 04:19.040
saying is that my job
and all the hours flying

04:19.160 --> 04:21.320
is what's stopping
us having the baby.

04:21.440 --> 04:23.040
But if I stop
working, we haven't

04:23.160 --> 04:24.320
got any money coming in.

04:24.440 --> 04:26.640
So maybe what God
is really saying

04:26.760 --> 04:29.400
is that I can't have
a baby because I

04:29.520 --> 04:31.360
have to keep paying the bills.

04:31.480 --> 04:33.400
So maybe I should just
forget about the--

04:38.160 --> 04:39.680
Just shush.

04:39.800 --> 04:41.560
It's got to be my fault.

04:41.680 --> 04:42.720
Why?

04:42.840 --> 04:44.440
Why can't it be his fault?

04:44.560 --> 04:45.800
It can't be Phineas.

04:45.920 --> 04:47.040
He has so much sperm.

04:47.160 --> 04:48.160
It must be me.

04:48.280 --> 04:49.840
TED WEST: It doesn't
matter how much

04:49.960 --> 04:51.760
there is if his swimmers aren'tmaking it to the finish line.

Mandela said?

OK, because it's
a pretty good one.

informed on him.

I mean, it was a
fairly obvious target.

05:48.240 --> 05:50.320

there's undercover cops

in the organization.

05:54.000 --> 05:56.400
Yeah, well, don't look at me.

05:56.520 --> 05:58.480

06:01.800 --> 06:03.000
No one.

were looking at me.

Don't worry about him.

06:27.280 --> 06:29.040
He's on a lot of
pain medication.

06:32.840 --> 06:34.760
I will tell you when
you tell me who this is.

And I'll tell you who this iswhen you tell me who this is.

06:38.120 --> 06:39.640
Who who is?

06:39.760 --> 06:41.600

about undercover cops.

So I'm going to
have to lay low.

07:35.440 --> 07:36.320
Why?

07:36.440 --> 07:37.400
Well, in case they find out.

07:37.520 --> 07:38.960
So what if they do?

07:39.080 --> 07:40.600
Are you scared they're goingto tie you up in macrame,

dealt with them.

Sure did.

are meeting the money.

A Rangipo lodge.

09:36.520 --> 09:38.160
Rangipo.

09:38.280 --> 09:39.640
Right.

09:39.760 --> 09:41.200
The point is this is thefirst time they've deviated

09:41.320 --> 09:43.320
from the tour schedule,
so maybe this is where

09:43.440 --> 09:44.360
they're picking up the money.

09:44.480 --> 09:45.800
In Turangi?

09:45.920 --> 09:46.840
Yeah, I know.

09:46.960 --> 09:48.400
It's a hunting lodge.

09:48.520 --> 09:50.120
I've been there hunting.

09:50.240 --> 09:51.480
Flash airs.

09:51.600 --> 09:52.920
The weather was shit, so
the only thing I bagged

09:53.040 --> 09:54.160
was a receptionist.

09:54.280 --> 09:58.080
What goes around
comes around, eh?

09:58.200 --> 10:01.960
But as a secluded placeto meet the money people,

10:02.080 --> 10:03.200
it works.

10:03.320 --> 10:04.840
Well, maybe they
want to get hunting.

10:04.960 --> 10:06.360
And miss the Mary's game?

10:06.480 --> 10:09.000
Maybe they're
just being racist.

saying, the yarpies

10:10.640 --> 10:11.880

maybe with all their cash.

10:14.320 --> 10:17.320

10:21.880 --> 10:23.440
grab the money while
they're out hunting.

10:23.560 --> 10:24.640
In and out job.

10:24.760 --> 10:26.400
This place is
bloody expensive, Ted.

10:26.520 --> 10:27.760
Five-star.

10:27.880 --> 10:29.880
And our finances are not
five-star at the moment.

10:30.000 --> 10:32.720
Well, maybe some of usbook in, do the business.

10:32.840 --> 10:36.440
The others wait nearby asbackup, which means you're out.

10:36.560 --> 10:38.040
Eh?

10:38.160 --> 10:39.200
TED WEST: Well, if it cutsup rough with these bastards,

10:39.320 --> 10:40.120
you're useless.

10:40.240 --> 10:41.000
Don't worry.

10:41.120 --> 10:42.560
You still get your cut.

10:42.680 --> 10:44.640
So I guess Ted and Iwill check into the lodge.

10:44.760 --> 10:48.200
We should just be able to
cover that for a night.

10:48.320 --> 10:49.360
Why you two?

10:49.480 --> 10:50.240
Gee, Burt.

10:50.360 --> 10:51.600
Why do you think?

10:51.720 --> 10:53.240
TED WEST: I think what
Lefty's trying to say,

10:53.360 --> 10:57.560
Burt, is that our faces areless likely to arouse suspicion

10:57.680 --> 11:00.000
with our Springbok friends.

11:00.120 --> 11:02.080
Is this racism?

11:02.200 --> 11:06.040
Yes, but in a good
way for all of us.

11:06.160 --> 11:07.560
And maybe thatreceptionist is still there.

11:07.680 --> 11:08.480
Even better.

11:12.280 --> 11:14.000
MIKE MCCARTHY: But how do Iknow I'm not being diddled?

11:14.120 --> 11:15.240
RITA WEST: You
offload your stuff

11:15.360 --> 11:17.000
to Eric, who drives
it down the line,

11:17.120 --> 11:19.760
where it gets sold in Palmyor New Plymouth or wherever

11:19.880 --> 11:21.520
for the agreed price.

11:21.640 --> 11:24.800
Then you take their goods,which Eric brings you,

11:24.920 --> 11:27.320
and you sell them
for the price agreed.

11:27.440 --> 11:28.760
ROD: Well, when you
put it like that, Rita,

11:28.880 --> 11:31.320
I can see about 100
ways I'll be diddled.

11:31.440 --> 11:34.360
Well, I guess that'swhere honesty comes in, Rod.

11:34.480 --> 11:36.760
What's to stop someone sayingthey haven't sold a piece when

11:36.880 --> 11:38.400
they have and keep the money?

11:38.520 --> 11:39.640
Honesty, Rod.

11:39.760 --> 11:41.120
ROD: And if someone
says they've sold

11:41.240 --> 11:43.280
something for less when
they haven't and they

11:43.400 --> 11:44.600
pocketed the difference?

11:44.720 --> 11:46.240
It's this fucking thing
called honesty, Rod?

11:46.360 --> 11:48.120
ROD: What's to stop
him keeping the stuff

11:48.240 --> 11:50.960
we give him to transport,and he unloads it himself?

11:51.080 --> 11:52.520
Because if he
did, I'd kill him.

11:52.640 --> 11:54.200
Yeah.

11:54.320 --> 11:56.880
This network is a great ideathat lessens all of our risk.

11:57.000 --> 11:58.720
By trusting our
stuff to this loser.

11:58.840 --> 12:00.440
ERIC: Well, he's taking
the most risk driving

12:00.560 --> 12:02.320
around with stolen goods.

12:02.440 --> 12:04.200
That's why I think that
my cut should be more.

12:04.320 --> 12:05.640
Not going to happen, Eric.

12:05.760 --> 12:06.920
ROD: OK, OK.

12:07.040 --> 12:08.120
So then we get the
system up and running.

12:08.240 --> 12:09.600
Who's keeping
track of the money?

12:09.720 --> 12:11.080
I am.

12:11.200 --> 12:13.560
So things are gettingsold left, right, and center

12:13.680 --> 12:15.560
all over the show,
and you're keeping

12:15.680 --> 12:17.320
track on who owes who what.

12:17.440 --> 12:19.000
Yep.

12:19.120 --> 12:21.800
And you can do
that, can you, Rita?

12:21.920 --> 12:22.840
Absolutely.

12:37.440 --> 12:39.560
So, what did you do on
this job of yours today?

12:43.680 --> 12:44.440
Just business.

12:44.560 --> 12:46.400
[thumping sounds]

12:56.400 --> 12:57.960
What about your business?

12:58.080 --> 12:58.920
How's that going?

12:59.040 --> 13:00.440
Do you really want to know?

13:00.560 --> 13:02.120
Sure.

13:02.240 --> 13:04.000
It was like herding cats.

13:04.120 --> 13:05.000
That's how it was today.

13:05.120 --> 13:05.880
TED WEST: Yeah?

13:06.000 --> 13:08.400
How so?

13:08.520 --> 13:12.040
Do you actually want to know?

13:12.160 --> 13:13.840
OK.

13:13.960 --> 13:15.760
I'm trying to set up
a network of shops

13:15.880 --> 13:17.080
around the North Island.

13:17.200 --> 13:20.320
Here, T Route, Clive,
Palmy, and New Plymouth.

13:20.440 --> 13:24.320
And any goods that arequestionable in one region

13:24.440 --> 13:26.840
get shifted to anotherregion to be sold on behalf.

13:26.960 --> 13:28.320
TED WEST: Away from prying eyes.

13:28.440 --> 13:29.600
It's a good idea.

13:29.720 --> 13:32.040
Thank you.

13:32.160 --> 13:34.240
But it's not totally
straightforward.

13:34.360 --> 13:35.920
What do you mean?

13:36.040 --> 13:37.920
RITA WEST: Keeping track of themoney and who owes what to who.

13:38.040 --> 13:39.000
TED WEST: Especially
when they're

13:39.120 --> 13:40.200
dodgy bastards like Rod Nugent.

13:40.320 --> 13:41.680
Exactly.

13:41.800 --> 13:43.960
TED WEST: Plus maths hasnever been your strong suit.

13:44.080 --> 13:45.040
I'm OK with maths.

13:45.160 --> 13:46.720
You failed school C maths.

13:46.840 --> 13:48.320
Yeah.

13:48.440 --> 13:50.640
But that's only because I waggedmost of my classes to play

13:50.760 --> 13:53.920
hide the sausage with you.

13:54.040 --> 13:55.480
Still have that uniform?

13:55.600 --> 13:56.880
Oh, for God's sake.

13:57.000 --> 13:58.840
[laughter]

13:59.920 --> 14:01.160
I'll have a look.

14:01.280 --> 14:02.560
If you want to be jugglingall those numbers,

14:02.680 --> 14:03.440
then that's fine.

14:06.240 --> 14:07.240
How's business with you, Ted?

14:07.360 --> 14:08.360
Do you actually have some?

14:11.000 --> 14:12.560
Yes, as a matter of fact.

14:25.280 --> 14:26.120
[clicking]

14:26.240 --> 14:27.680
Jesus!

14:27.800 --> 14:31.040
Don't move a muscle.

14:31.160 --> 14:32.760
Now you know how it feels.

14:32.880 --> 14:34.400
How what feels?

14:34.520 --> 14:37.280
To be that trophy
stag I will bring down.

14:37.400 --> 14:39.280
[laughter]

14:40.400 --> 14:43.200
Relax, it's not loaded.

14:43.320 --> 14:44.480
Or is it?

14:44.600 --> 14:45.960
NGAIRE MUNROE: Don't
be an asshole, Lefty!

14:46.080 --> 14:49.160
LEFTY MUNROE: But babe, I'mthe asshole you married.

14:49.280 --> 14:50.320
And guess what?

14:50.440 --> 14:52.960
I always will be.

14:53.080 --> 14:54.440
Now put some clothes.

14:54.560 --> 14:56.960
A [inaudible] would be good.

14:57.080 --> 14:58.440
TED WEST: Falani come through?BERT: Yeah.

14:58.560 --> 14:59.880
He scored some flash
wheels for the guys

15:00.000 --> 15:01.360
who get to stay in
the hotel and put them

15:01.480 --> 15:02.680
up in Mana Ru on the way out.

15:02.800 --> 15:03.560
Good work.

15:10.880 --> 15:12.320
You can take that
look off your face.

15:12.440 --> 15:13.280
It's a hunting lodge.

15:13.400 --> 15:14.160
We're hunters.

15:14.280 --> 15:15.760
I need to look the part.

15:15.880 --> 15:18.360
Just need to go for a slashbefore we hit the road, eh?

15:18.480 --> 15:19.720
TED WEST: Well,
make it snappy, OK?

15:22.600 --> 15:23.560
Hey, Carol.

15:23.680 --> 15:24.560
- Hey, Bert.
- Where's Rita?

15:24.680 --> 15:25.480
Bathroom.

15:29.080 --> 15:30.280
The fuck, Bert?

15:30.400 --> 15:31.880
We haven't got
long, and you need

15:32.000 --> 15:33.520
to listen to me like you'venever listened to me before.

15:33.640 --> 15:34.640
Why the hell
would I ever listen

15:34.760 --> 15:36.320
to you in the first place?

15:36.440 --> 15:38.680
Don't ask me how I know, butNgaire's rooting Mike McCarthy.

15:38.800 --> 15:39.600
What?

15:42.360 --> 15:43.400
How the fuck do you know that?

15:43.520 --> 15:44.520
I asked you not
to ask me that.

15:44.640 --> 15:45.640
Tough titty.

15:45.760 --> 15:47.000
You don't just get
to barge in here

15:47.120 --> 15:48.200
and blurt out something
like that without proof.

15:48.320 --> 15:49.240
BERT: Well, I saw them.

15:49.360 --> 15:50.520
Is that proof enough?

15:50.640 --> 15:51.720
You saw them rooting.

15:51.840 --> 15:53.880
BERT: I saw them
dancing in the undies.

15:54.000 --> 15:56.040
It was kind of worse.

15:56.160 --> 15:57.160
Where the hell
did you see that?

15:57.280 --> 15:59.080
In a fucking dream?

15:59.200 --> 16:00.480
McCarthy's place.

16:00.600 --> 16:04.040
Kunekune Ave.

16:04.160 --> 16:05.560
Why were you at
McCarthy's place?

16:05.680 --> 16:07.360
Isn't the question,what was she doing there--

16:07.480 --> 16:08.840
Are you his fucking
rat again, Bert?

16:08.960 --> 16:09.960
No.

16:10.080 --> 16:11.520
Yes.

16:11.640 --> 16:12.720
Well, sort of, and that's awhole other bit of my life

16:12.840 --> 16:14.360
I'm not proud of.

16:14.480 --> 16:16.840
I'm infiltrating theanti-tour movement for him--

16:16.960 --> 16:18.120
or I was.

16:18.240 --> 16:19.480
The reason I was
at his place was

16:19.600 --> 16:20.760
I went 'round there to
tell him where to stick

16:20.880 --> 16:22.560
it, which is when I saw them.

16:22.680 --> 16:23.720
I swear, Rita.

16:23.840 --> 16:24.840
I swear I'm telling
you the truth.

16:24.960 --> 16:26.440
She had on this
flash nighty thing

16:26.560 --> 16:27.920
and he was in this
orange robe, and they

16:28.040 --> 16:31.880
was laughing and dancingand having a right old time.

16:32.000 --> 16:32.800
I know.

16:32.920 --> 16:34.080
I did my hidden, too.

16:37.680 --> 16:38.880
Why are you telling me this?

16:39.000 --> 16:39.920
Because I don't know
what to do about it.

16:40.040 --> 16:41.240
- Well tell Lefty.
- Why?

16:41.360 --> 16:42.640
So he can kill her?

16:42.760 --> 16:44.760
Or me, if he doesn'tbelieve me-- if he thinks

16:44.880 --> 16:48.760
I'm lying because I'm the onesnitching to McCarthy, not her.

16:48.880 --> 16:50.320
I'm telling the truth, Rita.

16:50.440 --> 16:52.040
If you don't believe
me, bake me some

16:52.160 --> 16:53.720
of your special lemon tins.

16:53.840 --> 16:54.800
I'll eat the whole damned plate.

17:04.240 --> 17:05.120
Happy hunting.

17:05.240 --> 17:06.000
Oh, it will be.

17:15.840 --> 17:17.200
See you later.

17:17.320 --> 17:18.400
Oh, I might be a bit late.

17:25.200 --> 17:28.040
I've made a decision.

17:28.160 --> 17:29.320
Rita?

17:29.440 --> 17:30.240
What?

17:30.360 --> 17:31.720
I've made a decision.

17:31.840 --> 17:32.600
About what?

17:32.720 --> 17:34.640
About what you said.

17:34.760 --> 17:36.240
When?

17:36.360 --> 17:39.080
About how it might not bemy fault I can't get pregnant.

17:39.200 --> 17:40.600
Rita?
- Yeah, got it.

17:40.720 --> 17:41.600
With you.

17:41.720 --> 17:43.760
So I'm finding out.

17:43.880 --> 17:45.960
I've made an appointmentat family planning to get

17:46.080 --> 17:47.920
tested while Phineas is away.

17:48.040 --> 17:49.720
I feel like I'm cheating on him.

17:49.840 --> 17:52.920
Also, like I'm cheating
on God, sort of.

17:53.040 --> 17:54.920
Although God probably
already knows that.

18:00.600 --> 18:02.120
Just take the
bloody test, Carol.

18:02.240 --> 18:03.920
You're not cheating on anyone.

18:04.040 --> 18:04.840
Yeah.

18:08.680 --> 18:26.320
[inaudible speech on radio]

18:26.440 --> 18:28.840
LEFTY MUNROE: The lodge isabout a mile up the road.

18:28.960 --> 18:30.560
BERT: The lodge where
it's warm and dry?

18:30.680 --> 18:31.920
LEFTY MUNROE: Yes, that one.

18:32.040 --> 18:33.200
Everything turns
septic, one of us

18:33.320 --> 18:34.480
will come back and get you.

18:34.600 --> 18:35.720
OK.

18:35.840 --> 18:37.080
Until then, cuddle
up and keep warm.

18:37.200 --> 18:38.720
It's one night, guys.

18:38.840 --> 18:40.040
We'll hit them and be gone.

18:44.560 --> 18:45.600
Bloomin' typical.

18:45.720 --> 18:47.280
The whites have the
guns and get all

18:47.400 --> 18:49.200
the privileges while us brownfolk are left out in the cold.

18:52.000 --> 18:53.480
Did you bring any food?

18:53.600 --> 18:56.360
No, did you?

18:56.480 --> 18:57.320
Oh man.

19:24.680 --> 19:28.040
Mate, you need
to look the part.

19:35.120 --> 19:37.720
- Oh, Mr. McQueen, welcome back.- Hello, Sally.

19:37.840 --> 19:39.000
I love to see you again.

19:39.120 --> 19:40.560
Now we have the room booked.One night.

19:40.680 --> 19:42.320
Maybe two.
Queens.

19:42.440 --> 19:43.600
Yes.

19:43.720 --> 19:46.280
Just the one room?

19:46.400 --> 19:47.560
Yes.

19:47.680 --> 19:49.560
We don't plan on doing
a lot of sleeping.

19:49.680 --> 19:50.680
Oh, right.

19:50.800 --> 19:52.040
A lot like your
last visit, then?

19:52.160 --> 19:55.120
With a little luck.

19:55.240 --> 19:56.280
Can we just get
our key, please?

19:56.400 --> 19:57.160
Oh, yes.

19:57.280 --> 19:58.560
Certainly, Mr. Newman.

19:58.680 --> 20:00.560
There you go.

20:00.680 --> 20:03.600
And we were expecting
a message from a friend.

20:03.720 --> 20:04.840
Has it arrived?

20:04.960 --> 20:06.360
Oh, well, look.

20:06.480 --> 20:08.000
It's not here, but I'lljust check in the office.

20:08.120 --> 20:08.920
Thank you.

20:20.800 --> 20:22.160
No [inaudible] I'm afraid.

20:22.280 --> 20:23.360
Ah, that's all right.

20:23.480 --> 20:24.600
Not important.

20:24.720 --> 20:25.480
Thanks.

20:31.680 --> 20:33.640
Steve McQueen and Paul Newman.

20:33.760 --> 20:35.400
You could have attractedmore attention if you tried.

20:35.520 --> 20:37.880
No, I'm Paul McQueen
and you're Steve Newman.

20:38.000 --> 20:39.680
Oh, that's much better.

20:39.800 --> 20:51.800
[inaudible] We can sort thesleeping arrangements later.

21:01.160 --> 21:03.280
Your kids are
at school, right?

21:03.400 --> 21:04.680
Yes, why?

21:04.800 --> 21:06.080
So they won't see me do this.

21:06.200 --> 21:07.080
[slapping and grunting sounds]

21:07.200 --> 21:08.400
What the fuck was that for?

21:08.520 --> 21:09.640
RITA WEST: Guess.

21:09.760 --> 21:10.960
How long has it been
going on, Ngaire?

21:11.080 --> 21:12.360
How long has
what been going on?

21:12.480 --> 21:13.240
[slapping sound]

21:13.360 --> 21:15.040
Jesus!

21:15.160 --> 21:16.480
RITA WEST: I saw you.

21:16.600 --> 21:19.200
I saw you in that pigger'shouse, so cut this shit!

21:22.880 --> 21:23.680
Not long.

21:32.800 --> 21:34.200
- Who started it?
- Does it matter?

21:34.320 --> 21:35.280
RITA WEST: Yep.

21:35.400 --> 21:37.040
Did he come on to you?

21:37.160 --> 21:39.760
No, it was very much my idea.

21:39.880 --> 21:43.240
RITA WEST: Are you
sure about that?

21:43.360 --> 21:46.880
He didn't lure me into itand I'm not his informant.

21:47.000 --> 21:47.760
Not yet.

21:47.880 --> 21:49.640
NGAIRE MUNROE: Not ever.

21:49.760 --> 21:53.240
I've made it clear that ifhe tries, then it is over.

21:53.360 --> 21:54.840
You tell me about this--

21:54.960 --> 21:55.760
it, Ngaire.

21:55.880 --> 21:56.960
How the fuck did it start?

22:01.840 --> 22:03.440
Kindness.

22:03.560 --> 22:05.720
He showed me kindness.

22:05.840 --> 22:07.320
So that's all it takes, is it?

22:07.440 --> 22:08.920
Like you're a stray
fucking kitten!

22:09.040 --> 22:10.600
NGAIRE MUNROE: Yeah, wellafter a life with Lefty,

22:10.720 --> 22:12.440
it was a great fucking start.

22:26.360 --> 22:27.440
I don't really care
what you think,

22:27.560 --> 22:30.720
but Mike is a wonderful man.

22:30.840 --> 22:36.040
Kind and gentle,
and he respects me.

22:36.160 --> 22:37.680
He makes me feel like a--

22:37.800 --> 22:41.040
like a woman.

22:41.160 --> 22:42.400
He makes me laugh.

22:46.840 --> 22:48.080
Do you know what
it's like living

22:48.200 --> 22:51.680
with a cheating rat who
treats you like shit

22:51.800 --> 22:54.720
and takes you for granted?

22:54.840 --> 22:59.920
Comes home all hours,smelling like his latest slut.

23:00.040 --> 23:03.040
Do you know how
that makes you feel?

23:03.160 --> 23:05.560
Do you know what Mike
asked me the other day?

23:05.680 --> 23:06.520
I shudder to think.

23:09.160 --> 23:13.600
He asked me if I was
for or against the tour.

23:13.720 --> 23:15.440
Very romantic.

23:15.560 --> 23:17.200
NGAIRE MUNROE: He asked
me a question, Rita.

23:17.320 --> 23:20.280
One that wasn't,
what's for dinner?

23:23.520 --> 23:24.760
Mike wanted to know my thoughts.

23:27.720 --> 23:30.160
He wanted my opinion.

23:30.280 --> 23:32.120
And?

23:32.240 --> 23:34.720
NGAIRE MUNROE: And
I burst into tears.

23:37.840 --> 23:40.000
Yeah.

23:40.120 --> 23:42.000
How fucking sad is that?

23:45.720 --> 23:49.240
I don't know it had
to be Mike, but it is.

23:53.960 --> 23:55.960
Lefty's a prick.

23:56.080 --> 23:58.360
We all know he's a prick.

23:58.480 --> 24:00.680
But come on.

24:00.800 --> 24:02.160
Fucking McCarthy?

24:02.280 --> 24:05.120
You think I haven't thoughtthat hundreds of times?

24:05.240 --> 24:06.880
Every time I think aboutgoing back to his place--

24:07.000 --> 24:12.800
every time I'm walking
to his door, and then

24:12.920 --> 24:16.040
when I see how he looks at me--

24:16.160 --> 24:19.560
he adores me.

24:19.680 --> 24:21.040
When a man looks
at you like that,

24:21.160 --> 24:24.880
how can you not
feel 10 feet tall?

24:25.000 --> 24:27.640
It's the way I've seen countlesstimes the way Ted looks at you.

24:31.520 --> 24:32.800
And you really
think that McCarthy's

24:32.920 --> 24:35.200
going to make you happy?

24:35.320 --> 24:36.200
He already does.

24:40.160 --> 24:41.440
His name's Mike.

24:45.760 --> 24:48.080
I don't know how shefound out, but she knows.

24:48.200 --> 24:48.960
MIKE MCCARTHY: Calm down.

24:49.080 --> 24:50.080
There's a solution here.

24:50.200 --> 24:51.200
Calm down?

24:51.320 --> 24:52.560
This is Rita we're
talking about.

24:52.680 --> 24:54.800
She will not fuck around
with this information.

24:54.920 --> 24:56.480
Jesus.

24:56.600 --> 24:58.480
If the boys weren't out of town,then Lefty would know already.

24:58.600 --> 25:00.240
And don't ask me where,
because I don't--

25:00.360 --> 25:01.040
No, no, no.
I would never.

25:01.160 --> 25:01.920
We agreed.

25:02.040 --> 25:03.200
Yes, we did.

25:03.320 --> 25:05.760
It's just that when
you said, the boys, I

25:05.880 --> 25:09.040
think I know how she found out.

25:09.160 --> 25:10.240
Bert Thompson.

25:10.360 --> 25:11.960
Bert?

25:12.080 --> 25:13.840
How the fuck does
Bert know about us.

25:13.960 --> 25:15.040
Turned up here the other day.

25:15.160 --> 25:17.000
You were in the
bathroom or something.

25:17.120 --> 25:18.360
I told him to bugger off.

25:18.480 --> 25:19.760
The little prick must
have sneaked a peek.

25:19.880 --> 25:20.640
Christ.

25:24.360 --> 25:25.400
Why was Bert here?

25:25.520 --> 25:27.520
No, he's not
narcing on the gang.

25:27.640 --> 25:28.920
It's something else.

25:29.040 --> 25:29.840
Don't worry about Bert.

25:29.960 --> 25:31.080
I can deal with him.

25:31.200 --> 25:32.840
Before or after
he tells Lefty.

25:32.960 --> 25:34.520
Bert won't tell.

25:34.640 --> 25:37.400
He's a lot of things, is Bert--a much compromised individual.

25:37.520 --> 25:39.440
But he's not going to goand bleat to Ted or Lefty

25:39.560 --> 25:41.640
because he knows that shitwill rebound all over him.

25:41.760 --> 25:43.560
He told Rita.
MIKE MCCARTHY: Exactly.

25:43.680 --> 25:45.080
He told her because he
probably thinks she's

25:45.200 --> 25:46.240
the best one to deal with it.

25:55.720 --> 25:57.400
Leave him.

25:57.520 --> 25:59.360
What?

25:59.480 --> 26:01.280
Leave Lefty.

26:01.400 --> 26:02.800
You and the girls come
and live here with me.

26:02.920 --> 26:04.360
Problem solved.

26:04.480 --> 26:06.200
And when Lefty comes afteryou, I'll be there in spades

26:06.320 --> 26:07.880
to defend you.

26:08.000 --> 26:10.840
And I will destroy Lefty, and Iwill have so much fun doing it.

26:10.960 --> 26:12.320
I care for you, Ngaire.

26:12.440 --> 26:13.720
It'll be a new beginning
for both of us.

26:13.840 --> 26:15.240
No.
No.

26:15.360 --> 26:16.920
We don't have to stay here.We can move.

26:17.040 --> 26:18.280
I can't do this now.
MIKE MCCARTHY: Stay.

26:18.400 --> 26:19.160
Let's talk about it.

26:19.280 --> 26:22.120
I can't be here.

26:22.240 --> 26:24.040
[rain falling]

26:31.840 --> 26:33.200
South African bastards.

26:33.320 --> 26:37.600
They should be inNapier, not here in hell.

26:37.720 --> 26:38.840
Hell is hot.

26:38.960 --> 26:40.200
I should be in
Napier while they

26:40.320 --> 26:42.400
get their asses
kicked by the Marys,

26:42.520 --> 26:45.520
not freezing my gonads off here.

26:45.640 --> 26:47.000
South African bastards.

26:47.120 --> 26:48.720
Did you have
tickets to the game?

26:48.840 --> 26:49.880
Eh?

26:50.000 --> 26:51.720
You said you
should be in Napier.

26:51.840 --> 26:55.160
Yeah, something like that.

26:55.280 --> 26:56.760
Is that because you're a Mary?

26:56.880 --> 26:58.240
What?

26:58.360 --> 27:00.840
Did you get offered ticketsbecause you're a Mary?

27:00.960 --> 27:02.320
Something like that.

27:02.440 --> 27:03.960
How come I didn't
get offered tickets?

27:04.080 --> 27:06.240
I guess you don't
know the right Marys.

27:11.360 --> 27:12.840
Is there any more food?

27:12.960 --> 27:13.760
No.

27:17.360 --> 27:19.240
Oh, here we go.

27:19.360 --> 27:21.440
TED WEST: They're meant to beout in the bush bloody shooting

27:21.560 --> 27:22.720
things.

27:22.840 --> 27:24.160
LEFTY MUNROE: Yeah,
I'm thinking hunting

27:24.280 --> 27:26.440
of the four legged varietyis off the menu today.

27:26.560 --> 27:28.240
Can't blame them, really.

27:28.360 --> 27:29.840
Weather's shit.

27:29.960 --> 27:31.000
Maybe tomorrow.

27:31.120 --> 27:32.200
TED WEST: Well,
they leave tomorrow.

27:32.320 --> 27:33.120
How do you know?

27:33.240 --> 27:35.400
The book at the front desk.

27:35.520 --> 27:39.080
If the money's
here, it's here now.

27:39.200 --> 27:40.760
Too often with the
pain in his neck.

27:40.880 --> 27:46.360
[laughter]

27:46.480 --> 27:47.280
Come on.

27:47.400 --> 27:48.360
Where?

27:48.480 --> 27:50.160
- We'll do it now.
- Eh?

27:50.280 --> 27:51.600
Well, they're just in
the bloody corridor.

27:51.720 --> 27:53.520
In about 20 minutes,those rooms are going to be

27:53.640 --> 27:55.560
full of rotting boars, OK?

27:55.680 --> 27:56.520
It's now or never.

28:12.520 --> 28:14.040
LEFTY MUNROE: What
are we looking for?

28:14.160 --> 28:16.120
Bag big enough to hold a lotof cash would seem logical.

28:21.240 --> 28:22.760
LEFTY MUNROE: Have
you noticed what

28:22.880 --> 28:26.040
all these rooms have in common,apart from the complete lack

28:26.160 --> 28:26.960
of money?

28:27.080 --> 28:28.000
They all smell the same.

28:28.120 --> 28:28.880
[sniffing]

28:29.000 --> 28:30.960
Kind of gamy.

28:31.080 --> 28:33.000
Do you think all SouthAfricans smell like that, Ted?

28:33.120 --> 28:34.480
Lefty.

28:34.600 --> 28:37.480
Well, that's a lot smallerthan a big bag of money.

28:37.600 --> 28:38.400
Wow.

28:38.520 --> 28:44.640
Result. It's not here, Ted.

28:44.760 --> 28:46.360
Fucking look, it might be.

28:46.480 --> 28:47.960
Does it even exist, Ted?

28:48.080 --> 28:49.840
This mythical money.

28:49.960 --> 28:51.680
Me-- I don't think
it does exist.

28:51.800 --> 28:53.200
Never has.

28:53.320 --> 28:55.320
I think we've been chasingour tails this whole time

28:55.440 --> 28:58.240
because Des McEwen loves
a joke and he hates you,

28:58.360 --> 29:01.680
and we are that joke and heis laughing his socks off.

29:01.800 --> 29:03.400
Oh my God.

29:03.520 --> 29:04.800
What?

29:04.920 --> 29:06.520
What's this
stuff called again?

29:06.640 --> 29:08.040
Biltong.

29:08.160 --> 29:10.000
Well, that explains the smell.TED WEST: Yeah, OK.

29:10.120 --> 29:11.600
All right.
You've made your point.

29:11.720 --> 29:13.400
LEFTY MUNROE: The one timewhen everybody [inaudible] is

29:13.520 --> 29:15.080
looking the other
way, when we could

29:15.200 --> 29:18.920
be doing any bloody job we wantand making a fucking fortune--

29:19.040 --> 29:20.560
instead, what have we
got to show for it?

29:20.680 --> 29:22.040
Biltong.
- Hey.

29:22.160 --> 29:23.240
You fucking agreed, all right?

29:23.360 --> 29:24.520
And we all signed off on this.- Yeah.

29:24.640 --> 29:26.080
Yeah, we did, didn't we?

29:26.200 --> 29:27.720
We all followed you on thiswild fucking goose chase.

29:27.840 --> 29:29.240
The money is not here, Ted.

29:29.360 --> 29:30.520
There is no fucking money!

29:30.640 --> 29:32.480
[doorknob rattling]

29:38.040 --> 29:40.400
Yeah.

29:40.520 --> 29:44.360
[inaudible]

29:44.480 --> 29:45.840
[groaning]

29:48.560 --> 29:50.360
Eventually, he's
going to want to piss.

29:50.480 --> 29:53.760
He walks in, bam to the
head, then we leg it.

29:53.880 --> 29:54.880
That's your best idea?

29:55.000 --> 29:56.360
Well, have you
got a better one?

29:56.480 --> 29:58.320
[groaning]

29:59.880 --> 30:00.920
[thump]

30:01.040 --> 30:02.200
What was that?

30:02.320 --> 30:04.640
I don't know.

30:04.760 --> 30:06.600
[indistinct whispering]

30:13.840 --> 30:15.680
[groaning]

30:20.640 --> 30:21.920
Shit.

30:22.040 --> 30:23.200
Are you all right there, mate?Hey.

30:23.320 --> 30:24.200
What the fuck are you doing?

30:24.320 --> 30:25.160
Let's go, let's go.

30:25.280 --> 30:26.120
TED WEST: Can't leave him!

30:26.240 --> 30:27.080
Hey!

30:27.200 --> 30:28.480
What are you doing?

30:28.600 --> 30:29.720
This isn't your room!

30:29.840 --> 30:30.600
Is this your mate?

30:30.720 --> 30:32.160
We were just walking past.

30:32.280 --> 30:34.120
The door was open, and thisguy's lying on the floor.

30:34.240 --> 30:37.640
[inaudible] He forgets
to carry his pills.

30:37.760 --> 30:38.520
There you go.

30:38.640 --> 30:39.480
There you go.

30:44.440 --> 30:45.600
[non-english speech]

30:46.640 --> 30:48.360
You're a stupid bastard.

30:48.480 --> 30:51.120
Carry these on you all the time.

30:51.240 --> 30:52.000
Yeah, yeah.

30:55.080 --> 30:56.240
Thanks for your help, man.

30:56.360 --> 30:57.360
Yeah, yeah, no worries.

30:57.480 --> 30:58.640
I'm Yanni.

30:58.760 --> 30:59.520
I'm Steve.

30:59.640 --> 31:00.600
This is--

31:00.720 --> 31:01.520
Paul.

31:01.640 --> 31:02.760
Paul.

31:02.880 --> 31:04.960
Reckon you saved his life.

31:05.080 --> 31:06.800
Oh.

31:06.920 --> 31:09.080
So are you here
to threaten me?

31:09.200 --> 31:10.000
MIKE MCCARTHY: You?

31:10.120 --> 31:10.960
Jesus, Rita.

31:11.080 --> 31:12.840
Give me some credit.

31:12.960 --> 31:15.200
I do know there are some peoplewhere threats just won't work.

31:15.320 --> 31:16.800
RITA WEST: So why
are you here, then?

31:16.920 --> 31:21.680
Are you looking for a specialgift for a special someone?

31:21.800 --> 31:24.560
In a manner of speaking.

31:24.680 --> 31:26.040
I'm after your mercy.

31:26.160 --> 31:27.400
Right.

31:27.520 --> 31:29.960
Well, that's not aquality I'm legendary for.

31:30.080 --> 31:31.720
Yet I'm sure you're
still capable of it.

31:37.000 --> 31:39.480
Rita, you hold
all the aces here.

31:39.600 --> 31:42.280
What happens next
is all down to you.

31:42.400 --> 31:44.680
And I am fucking
thrilled about that.

31:44.800 --> 31:45.600
I bet you are.

31:49.640 --> 31:50.440
What about Bert?

31:50.560 --> 31:51.800
What if he blabs?

31:51.920 --> 31:53.760
Bert is a coward who
told you so it wouldn't

31:53.880 --> 31:56.680
be his problem anymore.

31:56.800 --> 31:59.160
Look, I know the
boys are out of town,

31:59.280 --> 32:01.160
and for once, I don't givea shit what they're up to.

32:01.280 --> 32:02.920
All I care about is that
we have a window here

32:03.040 --> 32:04.280
to do the right thing.

32:04.400 --> 32:05.600
RITA WEST: What the fuck
is right about shagging

32:05.720 --> 32:06.920
someone's wife?

32:07.040 --> 32:08.280
MIKE MCCARTHY: I'm a
better man than he is.

32:08.400 --> 32:11.280
Surely even you can see that.

32:11.400 --> 32:13.040
All right.

32:13.160 --> 32:15.600
So I'm just meant to turna blind eye so Ngaire

32:15.720 --> 32:17.640
can trade up to a fucking cop.

32:17.760 --> 32:21.520
MIKE MCCARTHY: So Ngaire and Ican see where this thing goes.

32:21.640 --> 32:23.800
I don't see it
going anywhere good.

32:23.920 --> 32:25.240
Maybe.

32:25.360 --> 32:27.120
But I think we deserve
the right to find out.

32:27.240 --> 32:29.120
We?
You and Ngaire?

32:29.240 --> 32:30.040
Yeah.

32:30.160 --> 32:31.720
Me and Ngaire.

32:31.840 --> 32:33.480
I want to make her happy.

32:33.600 --> 32:35.520
I want to look after her.

32:35.640 --> 32:38.120
I just want her.

32:38.240 --> 32:40.440
Jesus Christ.

32:40.560 --> 32:45.160
Aren't you two a bit old forthis Romeo and Juliet bullshit?

32:45.280 --> 32:48.520
You're never too
old for love, Rita.

32:48.640 --> 32:51.080
Or mercy.

32:51.200 --> 32:52.960
I'll leave it with you.

32:53.080 --> 32:55.120
RITA WEST: Yeah, why not?

32:55.240 --> 32:58.560
Every other fucker has.

32:58.680 --> 33:01.520
No disrespect, Steve,
but do you know what I

33:01.640 --> 33:03.920
really hate about your country?

33:04.040 --> 33:06.240
The fact that
everyone hates you?

33:06.360 --> 33:07.800
No, no, no.

33:07.920 --> 33:10.360
It's just a few subversivesstirring up trouble.

33:10.480 --> 33:12.800
We've met many good peoplehere in New Zealand.

33:12.920 --> 33:15.880
People like yourself whobelieve sport is sport and rugby

33:16.000 --> 33:16.800
is rugby!

33:16.920 --> 33:18.640
Rugby!

33:18.760 --> 33:20.280
Rugby!

33:20.400 --> 33:23.320
Now, do you know what I
hate about your country?

33:23.440 --> 33:24.480
The fact that
everyone can vote,

33:24.600 --> 33:25.360
no matter what their color?

33:28.440 --> 33:30.320
[laughter]

33:32.480 --> 33:34.120
Man, you're a funny fucker!

33:34.240 --> 33:35.640
[laughter]

33:37.320 --> 33:39.240
Hey, if you want to let yourkaffirs vote, that's fine.

33:39.360 --> 33:40.720
That's your business.

33:40.840 --> 33:43.360
MAN 2: You're not bloodysurrounded by the bastards.

33:43.480 --> 33:45.440
It was a draw, 12-all.

33:45.560 --> 33:47.280
Dodgy last minute
drongo, apparently.

33:47.400 --> 33:49.760
Who gives a shit?

33:49.880 --> 33:51.640
How come you guys
skipped this game.

33:51.760 --> 33:52.920
You've been to all the others.

33:53.040 --> 33:54.160
Have we, Steve?

33:54.280 --> 33:55.840
Well, I don't know.

33:55.960 --> 33:57.040
Somebody said something.

33:57.160 --> 33:58.280
MAN 2: It was bad
enough that we had

33:58.400 --> 33:59.680
to play against the
kaffirs, but to be

33:59.800 --> 34:01.440
in a stadium full ofwhites cheering on a bunch

34:01.560 --> 34:02.840
of coloreds-- fuck that.

34:02.960 --> 34:04.800
First, you play
against kaffirs.

34:04.920 --> 34:07.520
The next thing, you have
kaffirs in your team

34:07.640 --> 34:09.120
wearing the Springbok jersey.

34:09.240 --> 34:11.040
MAN 2: So we decide
to go hunting instead.

34:11.160 --> 34:13.200
And that's what I
hate about your country.

34:13.320 --> 34:14.520
The fucking weather.

34:14.640 --> 34:15.400
[laughter]

34:15.520 --> 34:16.800
MAN 2: Yeah.

34:16.920 --> 34:19.400
I want to shoot something,not hunt beaver.

34:19.520 --> 34:21.320
[laughter]

34:27.800 --> 34:29.640
[knocking]

34:32.560 --> 34:33.320
Carol.

34:33.440 --> 34:34.520
Rita.

34:34.640 --> 34:35.720
Is Ngaire here?

34:35.840 --> 34:38.080
She's getting changed.

34:38.200 --> 34:39.640
Into what?

34:39.760 --> 34:42.720
This hostess I know fromPan-Am swears by jazzercise,

34:42.840 --> 34:44.720
so I gave it a try and loved it.

34:44.840 --> 34:46.280
Ngaire!

34:46.400 --> 34:47.960
I think it might
help me get pregnant.

34:48.080 --> 34:50.240
You think everythingmight help you get pregnant.

34:50.360 --> 34:51.360
Well, yeah.

34:51.480 --> 34:52.840
Also, it's fun.

34:52.960 --> 34:54.720
But it is more fun withothers, and then Ngaire said

34:54.840 --> 34:56.000
she'd like to give it a try.

34:56.120 --> 34:57.880
You know, burn a few calories.

34:58.000 --> 34:59.360
Yeah, it's always
important to look

34:59.480 --> 35:02.320
your best for your husband.

35:02.440 --> 35:03.680
CAROL: We would have
asked you to join,

35:03.800 --> 35:06.640
but you know, we didn't
think it was your thing.

35:06.760 --> 35:08.320
RITA WEST: Don't
let me stop you.

35:08.440 --> 35:10.240
CAROL: OK.

35:10.360 --> 35:13.200
WOMAN ON TV: Coming down,growing taller with the head,

35:13.320 --> 35:17.560
feeling long and lean
and ready to jazzercise.

35:17.680 --> 35:19.240
And here we go.

35:19.360 --> 35:22.920
And 1, and 2, 3, and 4.

35:23.040 --> 35:26.400
And switch it, 6, you're
doing really great.

35:26.520 --> 35:29.400
And pretty soon, my
jazzercisers are going

35:29.520 --> 35:33.400
to join us to help me help you.

35:33.520 --> 35:34.680
PHINEAS: You know what this is?

35:34.800 --> 35:36.400
Freezing.

35:36.520 --> 35:38.560
This is racism.

35:38.680 --> 35:41.280
This is just how the blacksare treated in South Africa--

35:41.400 --> 35:43.360
forced to suffer while thewhite men live in luxury.

35:46.040 --> 35:49.600
I would kill for a pint.

35:49.720 --> 35:51.040
Well, bugger this.

35:55.000 --> 35:55.800
PHINEAS: Where to?

35:55.920 --> 35:56.680
We're going hunting.

35:59.800 --> 36:01.560
Oh, actually, mate, I
might call it a night.

36:01.680 --> 36:03.400
No, no, no, no, no.

36:03.520 --> 36:08.760
Hey, you want to know a secret?

36:08.880 --> 36:11.760
Sure, why not?

36:11.880 --> 36:15.720
The whole place is fucked.

36:15.840 --> 36:19.480
Anyone with any
brains is leaving.

36:19.600 --> 36:21.000
Leaving where?

36:21.120 --> 36:22.360
South Africa.

36:22.480 --> 36:23.240
The republic.

36:23.360 --> 36:24.160
Oh, yeah.

36:24.280 --> 36:25.640
Right.

36:25.760 --> 36:30.120
Yeah, it's a numbers game,and they outnumbered us.

36:30.240 --> 36:31.320
They?

36:31.440 --> 36:33.280
The blacks.

36:33.400 --> 36:35.040
There are millions of them.

36:35.160 --> 36:38.520
Like millions and millions,and they breed fast, too.

36:38.640 --> 36:39.920
And they're going to
take over, are they?

36:40.040 --> 36:42.520
No doubt there, my friend.

36:42.640 --> 36:46.440
It's just a matter of when.

36:46.560 --> 36:49.000
My friends and me-- we
look into the future

36:49.120 --> 36:52.040
and we see terrorists
like Mandela

36:52.160 --> 36:53.600
sweeping in and taking control.

36:53.720 --> 36:56.600
It will be a bloodbath.

36:56.720 --> 36:59.680
And do you know why?

36:59.800 --> 37:02.960
Because we treat the
blacks like shit, Steve.

37:03.080 --> 37:05.680
We're truly awful
to them and they're

37:05.800 --> 37:09.520
really pissed off about it.

37:09.640 --> 37:12.000
Do you know what we're
going to do about it?

37:12.120 --> 37:13.920
Make more laws
to oppress them?

37:14.040 --> 37:15.280
[laughter]

37:15.400 --> 37:18.200
No, not the government.

37:18.320 --> 37:20.960
Us.

37:21.080 --> 37:27.360
We're buying land
here in New Zealand.

37:27.480 --> 37:30.280
Browns Bay.

37:30.400 --> 37:32.680
Have you heard of it?

37:32.800 --> 37:33.600
Yeah, Auckland.

37:33.720 --> 37:35.520
The north shore.

37:35.640 --> 37:36.520
Yeah, yeah.

37:36.640 --> 37:38.480
Browns Bay!

37:38.600 --> 37:40.440
[laughter]

37:42.040 --> 37:44.200
White people living
in Browns Bay!

37:44.320 --> 37:45.200
[laughter]

37:45.320 --> 37:46.200
Too funny!

37:46.320 --> 37:48.200
[laughter]

37:50.320 --> 37:52.840
Is that legal?
Buying land here?

37:52.960 --> 37:55.400
I thought you had to jumpthrough all sorts of hoops.

37:55.520 --> 37:58.520
My friend, when you
have cold, hard cash,

37:58.640 --> 38:01.320
many things can be boughtand many doors opened.

38:01.440 --> 38:04.080
Didn't think you could takemoney out of South Africa.

38:04.200 --> 38:09.880
You can't unless you
have a very big yacht.

38:10.000 --> 38:14.400
Then you can sell your moneyanywhere in the world you want.

38:14.520 --> 38:15.440
You have a yacht?

38:15.560 --> 38:16.840
I have a very big yacht.

38:16.960 --> 38:20.560
It's my pride and joy.

38:20.680 --> 38:23.000
I would love to
see this yacht.

38:23.120 --> 38:25.440
Is it in New Zealand?

38:25.560 --> 38:26.840
Soon, soon.

38:26.960 --> 38:27.720
Soon.

38:30.760 --> 38:35.800
Maybe you can visit me inmy house in Browns Bay,

38:35.920 --> 38:38.080
and I will take you on my yacht.

38:38.200 --> 38:39.920
I would like that very much.

38:40.040 --> 38:40.880
[glasses clinking]

38:41.000 --> 38:42.240
[laughter]

38:42.360 --> 38:44.720
LEFTY MUNROE: OK, let's
fucking shoot something!

38:44.840 --> 38:46.640
[cheering]

38:48.680 --> 38:51.880
Are you sure this is the way?

38:52.000 --> 38:54.680
I see lights.

38:54.800 --> 38:57.000
I swear if a wild pig
comes around the corner,

38:57.120 --> 38:58.080
I'm going to eat it raw.

38:58.200 --> 39:00.320
The light has food.

39:00.440 --> 39:05.600
We break in, find some food,and then finding Ted and Lefty

39:05.720 --> 39:07.760
and crash in their room.

39:07.880 --> 39:10.480
MAN 2: Here, have a go.

39:10.600 --> 39:11.360
Very light.

39:11.480 --> 39:13.120
A Remington 700.

39:13.240 --> 39:14.960
You can shoot anything with it.

39:15.080 --> 39:16.880
Leopard, giraffe, baboon.

39:23.760 --> 39:26.080
Colored bastards come to stealour money-- take our women.

39:26.200 --> 39:26.960
[gunshot]

39:27.080 --> 39:28.200
Fuck!

39:28.320 --> 39:29.680
LEFTY MUNROE: Mate,
this is New Zealand!

39:29.800 --> 39:31.160
You can't just go
around shooting people

39:31.280 --> 39:32.120
just because they're colored!

39:32.240 --> 39:33.000
Why not?

39:33.120 --> 39:34.480
You just can't!

39:34.600 --> 39:36.600
But you can scare the livingdaylights out of them.

39:36.720 --> 39:38.600
[gunshots and laughter]

39:46.160 --> 39:50.000
CAROL: I find out tomorrowif I can, you know--

39:50.120 --> 39:51.800
Come and see me
as soon as you know.

39:51.920 --> 39:52.680
I will.

40:01.120 --> 40:02.760
See you, then.

40:02.880 --> 40:03.720
Bye, Ngaire.

40:10.680 --> 40:13.000
Well?

40:13.120 --> 40:16.680
Someone very wise oncesaid something about keeping

40:16.800 --> 40:20.080
your enemies close.

40:20.200 --> 40:23.320
Do you know the saying
I'm talking about?

40:23.440 --> 40:24.480
Is that what I am?

40:24.600 --> 40:25.400
Your enemy?

40:28.040 --> 40:32.080
You're an enemy to the
way I want things to be.

40:32.200 --> 40:34.600
So yeah.

40:34.720 --> 40:36.200
Are you going to tell Lefty?

40:42.960 --> 40:45.880
Here's what's going to happen.

40:46.000 --> 40:48.080
You are going to
come and work for me

40:48.200 --> 40:50.560
for actual pay at the Galleria.

40:50.680 --> 40:53.360
You won all the prizes atschool for bookkeeping, right?

40:53.480 --> 40:54.360
A long time ago.

40:54.480 --> 40:55.640
What's this got to do--

40:55.760 --> 40:56.720
RITA WEST: At the
Galleria, you are going

40:56.840 --> 40:59.240
to help me move money around--

40:59.360 --> 41:01.040
money earned from stolen goods.

41:01.160 --> 41:05.520
So every time you do this,you'll be committing a crime.

41:05.640 --> 41:09.240
This is so when your tacky,bloody affair becomes

41:09.360 --> 41:15.040
public knowledge, whichit will, that if McCarthy

41:15.160 --> 41:17.840
decides to take
it out on me, then

41:17.960 --> 41:21.240
I will take you down with me.

41:21.360 --> 41:22.560
OK?

41:22.680 --> 41:26.160
So you're not
going to tell Lefty?

41:26.280 --> 41:30.720
And you're not going totell McCarthy about our deal.

41:30.840 --> 41:32.160
What shall I tell him?

41:32.280 --> 41:34.400
That I'm biting my lipwhen I should be shouting

41:34.520 --> 41:35.400
it from the bloody rooftops.

41:35.520 --> 41:36.320
Hm.

41:40.040 --> 41:41.440
Tell him he's
lucky that Lefty's

41:41.560 --> 41:42.520
a bigger prick than he is.

41:46.440 --> 41:48.960
And if you want to
go and do that now,

41:49.080 --> 41:50.520
I'll babysit your kids.

42:00.920 --> 42:01.720
Thank you.

42:04.760 --> 42:05.520
You're fuckin' welcome.

42:17.600 --> 42:19.480

42:35.520 --> 42:37.400
[cars running]

42:40.000 --> 42:41.400
[crying]

42:41.520 --> 42:44.360
CAROL: All my bits andpieces are fully operational.

42:44.480 --> 42:45.760
That's what they said.

42:45.880 --> 42:48.520
So there's no reason why
I can't get pregnant.

42:48.640 --> 42:49.960
There is one.

42:50.080 --> 42:51.560
He's shooting blanks.

42:51.680 --> 42:53.680
CAROL: When Phineascomes, it's like someone's

42:53.800 --> 42:55.040
turned a sperm hose on.

42:55.160 --> 42:57.400
They can't all be
blanks, can they?

42:57.520 --> 42:59.320
[honking]

43:02.800 --> 43:04.040
Ladies, ladies!

43:04.160 --> 43:06.960
The mighty white
hunters have returned!

43:07.080 --> 43:09.680
We almost bagged us some[inaudible] but they got away.

43:09.800 --> 43:10.880
You're not funny, Lefty.

43:11.000 --> 43:11.880
LEFTY MUNROE: Hey,
I saved your life.

43:12.000 --> 43:13.720
Where's the gratitude?

43:21.560 --> 43:23.160
Hey, what's wrong?

43:23.280 --> 43:24.080
Nothing.

43:24.200 --> 43:27.080
I just missed you so much.

43:27.200 --> 43:28.520
PHINEAS: Hot bath and bed?

43:28.640 --> 43:29.960
CAROL: What a lovely idea.

43:34.920 --> 43:36.760
Productive trip?

43:36.880 --> 43:39.160
No.

43:39.280 --> 43:41.120
But most definitely yes.

43:41.240 --> 43:43.560
