Surprise!

02:39.409 --> 02:43.073
You foolishly doubted my powers.

02:43.789 --> 02:45.405
It looks like evil won!

02:45.707 --> 02:48.244
And who, who, who is evil?

02:48.418 --> 02:51.627
I am! I am! I am!

02:52.297 --> 02:55.790
In one brief moment,
the power of your love

turn you into?

03:17.155 --> 03:19.817
A rabbit? A grasshopper?

03:20.367 --> 03:23.075
Oh! Into a flower!

03:27.124 --> 03:29.240
<i>I... won't... leave...</i>

03:29.710 --> 03:31.041
it like that.

03:31.503 --> 03:35.337
I'll find a way.
I will put it right.

03:35.924 --> 03:39.508
I will put it right!
You must be defeated

CROWD GASPS

Oh! A teleportation potion!

03:46.977 --> 03:48.593
Are you trying to escape?

03:49.062 --> 03:51.394
Well, run then, you coward!

03:51.648 --> 03:54.310
And I will make sure that you...

03:54.443 --> 03:56.684
MAN: Hey, Lord! More bachelors
are coming to propose.

03:56.820 --> 03:59.482
...until the end
of your pathetic life!

Dashing!

04:14.755 --> 04:16.462
"I will never forgive you!"

04:16.548 --> 04:18.789
HE SIGHS
- Chernomor! Ruslan! Huh?

04:18.884 --> 04:21.250
"I will never forgive..."
Ruslan, hey!

04:21.803 --> 04:23.669
Ruslan!
- Oh, uh...

04:23.930 --> 04:26.217
Where art thou, my Juliet?

04:26.558 --> 04:29.391
Do come,
come out onto the balcony.

04:29.603 --> 04:31.844
I want to look into
thine eyes...

04:32.105 --> 04:34.517
A-whaaa? What Juliet?
What balcony?

04:34.566 --> 04:36.148
Argh... Are you nuts?

04:36.276 --> 04:37.858
Oh! I mean, uh...

04:37.903 --> 04:38.768
Chernomor!

04:39.029 --> 04:40.645
I will never forgive you!

04:40.822 --> 04:42.654
I will find a Way!

04:43.408 --> 04:44.273
<i>Ugh...</i>

04:44.701 --> 04:46.317
Oh well, what's the point?

04:46.703 --> 04:48.364
Everyone has left anyway.

04:48.538 --> 04:49.573
Oh, no, no, no!

04:49.790 --> 04:52.532
We perform until the last viewer
is gone.

04:52.834 --> 04:53.699
What?

04:54.377 --> 04:55.993
Or the last listener.

04:56.254 --> 04:58.791
Heh? Who said that?

04:59.090 --> 05:00.797
I can't hear you, either!

05:01.176 --> 05:04.544
But then again,
maybe that's a good thing...

05:04.846 --> 05:05.711
Ugh.

05:06.056 --> 05:10.050
Lestor, everyone is sick of
your fairy tales of sorcerers.

05:11.561 --> 05:13.268
Can't you write something
modern?

05:13.396 --> 05:14.978
Something about knights?

05:15.232 --> 05:18.099
What you have to do
is learn your lines!

05:18.318 --> 05:20.480
Those knights
are all you can think of!

05:20.946 --> 05:23.028
But how cool is that!

05:23.281 --> 05:26.069
You're dressed in armour,
your sword in your hand

05:26.326 --> 05:28.988
and over there in the distance
you can see...

05:29.037 --> 05:31.244
Yourself cleaning the stage.

05:31.331 --> 05:34.665
...a beautiful princess
who needs to be rescued.

05:34.709 --> 05:37.201
Not "yourself cleaning
the stage"!

05:37.754 --> 05:40.496
How I want to call it quits
and become a knight!

05:41.091 --> 05:43.002
Children of knights
become knights

05:43.176 --> 05:46.214
but you're the son of an actor,
so it's not your choice.

05:46.304 --> 05:48.045
It's just the way it is.

05:48.640 --> 05:50.096
Thank you for the reminder!

05:50.433 --> 05:53.642
CLATTERING
Woah, they went a mile a minute.

05:54.479 --> 05:57.016
Huh, argh...
- Ugh...

05:58.358 --> 06:01.316
It looks like the marriage
proposals did not go very well.

06:01.361 --> 06:02.396
KNIGHT:
Whoaaaa!

06:02.445 --> 06:03.856
CLATTERING
Ugh...

06:04.656 --> 06:07.739
Yeah, and it pulled
our entire audience away.

06:07.826 --> 06:10.614
Well, let's try to find
something for dinner.

06:10.912 --> 06:14.871
Yes, yes! And in the meantime,
I shall write another chapter

06:14.916 --> 06:17.624
of my ultimate genius play!

06:19.045 --> 06:19.910
<i>Mm...</i>

06:29.556 --> 06:31.092
BIRDS TWEET

06:32.434 --> 06:33.720
KNOCK ON DOOR
- KING: Mila!

06:33.768 --> 06:35.725
Such behaviour
is not acceptable!

06:36.104 --> 06:37.970
But I don't want to get married!

06:38.440 --> 06:41.523
Stop this at once! Open the door
right now!

06:41.902 --> 06:43.017
SHE GASPS

06:44.654 --> 06:46.440
There! Problem solved.

06:47.616 --> 06:49.402
No one will ever--
- Mila!

06:49.451 --> 06:50.532
...enter?

06:50.619 --> 06:53.327
Oh, but how did you... I mean,
you were just over there!

06:53.455 --> 06:55.321
A-ha! A secret passage!

06:55.373 --> 06:56.408
I knew it.

06:57.125 --> 07:00.584
Mila, marriage is not something
you should be afraid of.

07:00.629 --> 07:04.122
I will make sure your husband
will protect you the way I do.

07:04.549 --> 07:06.005
My point exactly!

07:06.217 --> 07:08.003
This is what your protection
is like...

07:08.345 --> 07:10.211
IN DEEP VOICE:
"Don't go here, it's dangerous!

07:10.639 --> 07:12.846
Don't go there, it's dangerous!"

07:12.891 --> 07:14.302
IN NORMAL VOICE:
"Don't go anywhere because

07:14.351 --> 07:15.682
everywhere is dangerous!

07:15.769 --> 07:18.727
Stay at home, Mila,
all your life!"

07:18.772 --> 07:21.480
While someone else
sails the seven seas

07:21.775 --> 07:24.358
climbs mountaintops
and tames dragons.

07:24.653 --> 07:27.020
See her? That will be me soon.

07:27.072 --> 07:28.358
Oh!
- I will not permit you

07:28.406 --> 07:29.396
to look like this.

07:29.783 --> 07:32.241
Plus she's wearing too much
lipstick and mascara!

07:33.078 --> 07:34.534
Oh! Argh!

07:35.163 --> 07:36.278
Sorry! Ha-ha...

07:36.748 --> 07:38.364
But it's not about make-up

07:38.625 --> 07:41.538
and what made rne think
you would ever understand?

07:41.753 --> 07:43.539
You are a princess, Mila!

07:43.797 --> 07:45.629
It is finally time
you acted like one.

07:46.132 --> 07:47.463
I know what that means.

07:47.717 --> 07:50.004
That means that a princess
should be boring

07:50.136 --> 07:52.548
predictable, and well-behaved.

07:52.597 --> 07:55.009
And above all, depressed!

07:55.225 --> 07:57.637
<i>D... d... d... what'.!</i>

07:57.811 --> 08:00.394
You drive me crazy
with these big words!

08:01.022 --> 08:03.434
Oh, how you're just like
your mother.

08:03.900 --> 08:05.231
Oh, Mother...

08:05.944 --> 08:07.400
Mother would understand me.

08:09.614 --> 08:12.447
Mila, I won't be here forever.

08:13.702 --> 08:16.990
And if I go as unexpectedly
as your mother did

08:17.747 --> 08:20.739
I want to make sure that someone
will look after you.

08:22.752 --> 08:25.494
But I don't want anyone
to look after me.

08:25.755 --> 08:27.917
I can do that just fine.

08:27.966 --> 08:30.879
I dream of big things
happening for me.

08:31.261 --> 08:34.504
Even if it's a small adventure
it will be better than this.

08:34.847 --> 08:36.839
I want to feel alive
in the world

08:36.890 --> 08:39.178
and not trapped
in this stupid castle!

08:39.227 --> 08:41.183
Mila, you're unbearable.

08:41.895 --> 08:43.636
This is not your choice.

08:44.274 --> 08:46.106
You will get married anyway

08:46.359 --> 08:48.691
and if you don't choose a groom
by tomorrow

08:48.737 --> 08:50.648
I will choose one for you.

08:50.905 --> 08:54.148
This is the King's word,
and it is final.

08:54.576 --> 08:56.533
She wants adventures! Ha!

08:56.578 --> 08:58.319
Imagine!
- Not my choice?

08:58.663 --> 08:59.528
Really?

09:09.841 --> 09:11.002
Ta! Ha!

09:11.384 --> 09:12.590
Here you go.
- Wow! Haha!

09:16.556 --> 09:18.888
Oh, thank you, thank you.
You shouldn't have.

09:18.975 --> 09:20.056
Same time tomorrow?
- Bye!

09:20.101 --> 09:20.966
Bye!

09:21.728 --> 09:22.718
Nice haul, eh?

09:22.771 --> 09:24.432
HORSE NEIGHS
- on!

09:26.274 --> 09:27.435
HE GRUNTS

09:28.193 --> 09:29.058
Wait!

09:29.235 --> 09:30.817
HOOVES SCREECH

09:31.988 --> 09:33.023
What's happened?

09:33.448 --> 09:34.609
I'm sick!

09:35.325 --> 09:36.190
Again?

09:36.493 --> 09:38.279
I'm sorry, br...
- RATMIR LAUGHS

09:38.453 --> 09:41.366
Ratmir, do not laugh
at your brother!

09:41.831 --> 09:44.493
And stop picking your nose!

09:44.876 --> 09:46.662
<i>Gyeurgh, mon Dieu!</i>

09:46.878 --> 09:50.337
Why am I the only one
in our family with brains?

09:50.715 --> 09:51.876
Hey, you, sir!

09:52.300 --> 09:54.416
It would be nice
of you to apologise.

09:54.719 --> 09:57.757
Did someone just say something?

09:58.056 --> 10:00.639
Ratmir, did you hear
someone speaking?

10:00.683 --> 10:03.391
Uh... Yeah, yeah, Farlaf,
that guy right here!

10:04.104 --> 10:05.390
Oh!
- You fool!

10:05.438 --> 10:08.146
Don't you know
when to play along? Hm?

10:08.233 --> 10:10.270
Let's see what we have here.
- But I thought...

10:10.735 --> 10:13.193
FARLAF:
What a buffoon we have found!

10:13.655 --> 10:18.024
How dare you to state claims
to me, His Highness

10:18.326 --> 10:21.694
Knight Farlaf
and your future king?

10:21.996 --> 10:23.703
I am not a buffoon.

10:24.165 --> 10:26.702
His Highness, Knight Falafel.

10:27.460 --> 10:29.872
<i>Faflaf'. Je suis Farlaf!</i>

10:30.213 --> 10:31.499
Rogday, Ratmir!

10:32.090 --> 10:36.084
You will know the true power
of the noble--

10:36.136 --> 10:38.002
Now, now...
- ROGDAY RETCHES

10:38.263 --> 10:39.378
As I was saying...

10:40.014 --> 10:43.132
Now, you will know the...

10:43.643 --> 10:45.384
Rogday!
- Give me a second.

10:47.897 --> 10:50.810
Now, you will know the power

10:50.859 --> 10:53.601
of noble Sir Farlaf!

10:53.653 --> 10:55.439
ROGDAY VOMITS

10:55.905 --> 10:57.987
THEY LAUGH

10:58.116 --> 10:58.981
<i>Wh...!</i>

10:59.117 --> 11:01.108
I am still a knight!

11:01.411 --> 11:05.700
And now I am destined for feats,
castles and princesses.

11:05.832 --> 11:09.325
And you are destined
for holey pockets

11:09.377 --> 11:10.867
rags for clothes

11:10.962 --> 11:14.045
and the company
of this flying eyesore.

11:14.424 --> 11:17.712
Nothing in this world
can change it.

11:17.802 --> 11:19.133
ROGDAY:
Farlaf! Wait!

11:19.179 --> 11:20.169
FARLAF LAUGHS

11:20.221 --> 11:22.212
Una is a titmouse!

11:22.599 --> 11:23.634
<i>And I...</i>

11:25.810 --> 11:27.050
I am not a buffoon.

11:38.031 --> 11:39.066
Hmm...

11:41.618 --> 11:44.280
Well, this place doesn't look
very dangerous.

11:44.329 --> 11:45.410
Hehehe!
- Oh!

11:45.455 --> 11:48.743
Hey, beauty,
I can see you need help.

11:50.001 --> 11:52.038
<i>Uh... no, thank you.</i>

11:52.086 --> 11:54.123
I am totally fine. Haha!

11:54.464 --> 11:56.956
Oh!
- Hey there, girly.

11:57.508 --> 12:00.296
What brings such a beauty
to our hood?

12:00.678 --> 12:04.046
Didn't Mommy and Daddy
ever tell you these parts

12:04.098 --> 12:07.307
are filled with... gangsters?

12:07.435 --> 12:11.144
Right. Those are terrible
people, you know!

12:11.522 --> 12:13.308
But tonight's your lucky night.

12:13.399 --> 12:16.437
We can protect you
for a minimal fee

12:16.611 --> 12:20.980
say, for that price of that
fine necklace you're wearing.

12:22.283 --> 12:23.148
No way!

12:23.910 --> 12:24.775
Aargh!

12:25.245 --> 12:26.280
My face!

12:26.454 --> 12:28.786
Ouch... why are you just
standing there?

12:28.831 --> 12:29.787
Go get her!

12:37.799 --> 12:38.834
MILA:
Whoa!

12:41.636 --> 12:42.501
Huh?

12:45.014 --> 12:45.879
<i>Miss...</i>

12:46.975 --> 12:48.261
Uh, Miss.

12:48.476 --> 12:49.386
Are you alright?

12:50.311 --> 12:51.176
<i>Uh...</i>

12:52.855 --> 12:53.845
Really?

12:55.858 --> 12:56.893
MILA:
Oh!

12:58.069 --> 12:58.934
Ahhh!

12:59.654 --> 13:00.644
HE CACKLES

13:01.030 --> 13:02.191
Not again.

13:03.574 --> 13:06.316
Oh...? Sorry, do you need help?

13:06.619 --> 13:08.030
Ha!
- Ho-ho, whoa!

13:08.121 --> 13:10.453
Easy! I was just trying to help.

13:10.540 --> 13:13.658
If you still want to help,
please, call the guards

13:13.751 --> 13:14.991
or a knight perhaps.

13:15.378 --> 13:16.243
A knight...

13:17.338 --> 13:18.920
Uh, I am a knight!

13:18.965 --> 13:20.501
Uh... are you sure?

13:20.675 --> 13:23.542
Yeah! Sir Ruslan,
at your service.

13:23.928 --> 13:25.965
What has happened to you,
my lady?

13:26.014 --> 13:26.879
Them!

13:27.265 --> 13:28.221
Gotcha!

13:28.349 --> 13:30.181
GANGSTERS LAUGH

13:30.226 --> 13:31.182
RUSLAN:
Uh...

13:31.728 --> 13:33.310
Get lost, wuss!

13:33.438 --> 13:34.803
This is our booty.

13:35.231 --> 13:38.223
Give me the necklace,
or you will regret it!

13:38.609 --> 13:40.850
SHE GASPS
It's my mum's pendant.

13:41.112 --> 13:42.648
I will never take it off.

13:43.364 --> 13:44.854
Huh? Hehehe!

13:44.907 --> 13:47.695
No. After all, I am a knight.

13:48.119 --> 13:50.451
And I will not let you
take advantage of the lady.

13:52.040 --> 13:54.031
Well, Well. And...?

13:54.292 --> 13:55.999
You probably tried to skimp

13:56.044 --> 13:58.331
and bought this toothpick
on sale!

13:58.504 --> 14:00.586
RUSLAN: Come on...
- I, on the other hand

14:00.631 --> 14:03.965
am no cheapskate
when it comes to weapons.

14:04.177 --> 14:06.965
OK. Plan B, then...

14:07.305 --> 14:08.716
Look! There! Guards!

14:08.806 --> 14:09.796
Huh? Guards?

14:16.481 --> 14:18.222
Finally! Ha-ha!

14:23.446 --> 14:26.404
Are you kidding? That sword
wouldn't scare a chicken!

14:26.491 --> 14:28.778
Ha!
This is just the newest version.

14:30.036 --> 14:30.901
OQh!

14:31.329 --> 14:32.194

But haven't we won?

15:46.279 --> 15:47.986
Grrr!
- Argh! Hey!

15:48.406 --> 15:49.396
We've gotta run!

15:49.824 --> 15:50.689
Follow me.

15:53.369 --> 15:55.030
GANGSTERS: This way!
- Let's get 'em!

15:56.205 --> 15:57.070
Here!

16:01.335 --> 16:03.497
Shh.
- They was just right here!

16:03.588 --> 16:04.828
Then they disappeared...

16:07.008 --> 16:07.873
Urgh!

16:08.801 --> 16:10.383
UNA TWEETS

16:11.345 --> 16:12.210

- Uh... oh.

16:14.974 --> 16:15.839
Sorry.

16:16.184 --> 16:17.766
That's fine.
HE CHUCKLES

16:18.186 --> 16:19.051
Let's go.

16:21.606 --> 16:22.562
We're safe now.

16:25.026 --> 16:26.608
Thank you for rescuing me.

16:26.652 --> 16:28.188
Aw, it was nothing.

16:28.321 --> 16:30.483
For a skilled knight like myself

16:30.615 --> 16:32.231
that was child's play.

16:32.325 --> 16:34.407
We are trained for precisely...

16:34.452 --> 16:35.533
UNA TWEETS
- on!

16:38.748 --> 16:41.831
Eh... so, you're not
from around here?

16:42.001 --> 16:43.412
And what makes you think that?

16:43.461 --> 16:46.499
All locals know that these parts
are full of, uh...

16:46.547 --> 16:47.537
HE LAUGHS NERVOUSLY

16:47.590 --> 16:50.298
Gangsters? Now I know that, too.

16:50.885 --> 16:53.172
So, where are you from?

16:53.221 --> 16:55.383
It doesn't matter.
I left that place

16:55.431 --> 16:58.264
and I don't want to go back.
- Uh-huh, uh...

16:58.351 --> 17:01.059
Am I to assume
it was a terrible place?

17:01.687 --> 17:05.976
No, it wasn't terrible.
Just... boring.

17:06.358 --> 17:09.192
It's probably hard for you
to imagine how it feels

17:09.237 --> 17:12.069
to have your destiny
be predetermined at birth.

17:12.448 --> 17:15.781
When nothing exciting
ever happens to you.

17:16.117 --> 17:17.825
When all you can be
is the person

17:17.869 --> 17:20.953
other people think you are,
and everything in your life...

17:21.040 --> 17:22.326
ls not your choice?

17:22.833 --> 17:25.871
Exactly! ls not your choice.

17:26.462 --> 17:28.373
This is why
you decided to run away?

17:28.923 --> 17:29.788
<i>Ugh...</i>

17:30.424 --> 17:33.166
I just want to experience
real life.

17:33.844 --> 17:35.460
Real adventure...

17:35.555 --> 17:36.636
real freedom.

17:36.931 --> 17:39.172
Now I understand
how silly it is.

17:39.600 --> 17:43.889
Even here, that weird little man
on the wall is laughing at me.

17:44.647 --> 17:45.512
Huh!

17:47.441 --> 17:48.306
Hm.

17:49.569 --> 17:51.230
It's not that silly after all.

17:51.862 --> 17:54.479
If you want adventure,
then adventure it is.

17:56.701 --> 17:58.487
Hey! Where are you going?

17:58.786 --> 17:59.776
I have an idea.

18:00.121 --> 18:02.613
That is, if you're not afraid
to trust a stranger.

18:06.836 --> 18:07.701
Whoa!

RUSLAN:
It's always chilly at sunrise.

21:05.639 --> 21:08.006
Ruslan, this sunrise...

21:08.601 --> 21:10.308
Look how beautiful.

21:11.687 --> 21:12.518
<i>Oh...</i>

21:14.356 --> 21:17.644
I've never felt so alive

to accompany you.

CHERNOMOR CACKLES

22:41.652 --> 22:44.110
You pathetic fool!

A mortal can never resist the
sorcery of the great Chernomor!

22:50.536 --> 22:51.571
Chernomor?

22:52.121 --> 22:55.113
I will take what I want anyway.

22:55.583 --> 22:57.244
Ruslan! Hold on!

22:59.169 --> 23:01.160
Mila, whatever happens

23:01.255 --> 23:03.792

do you hear me?

23:04.174 --> 23:06.381
I will find you!
Wherever you are.

23:06.677 --> 23:07.758

23:20.649 --> 23:23.607
What did you do to my daughter?

23:23.944 --> 23:25.275
To your daughter?

23:25.696 --> 23:27.937
Mila! What did you do to her?

23:28.198 --> 23:29.984
She is a princess?

23:30.159 --> 23:31.991
I... I didn't do anything.

23:32.369 --> 23:34.201
She was kidnapped
by Chernomor.

23:34.371 --> 23:36.362
Chernomor? Who is he?

23:36.498 --> 23:40.537
Where can I find him?
- Uh, I don't know for sure.

23:40.586 --> 23:43.044
Answer me! Answer immediately!

23:43.380 --> 23:44.791
In the magic land!

23:45.007 --> 23:46.247
CROWD MUTTERS:
Magic land...?

23:46.300 --> 23:47.711
This guy's gone insane!

23:48.218 --> 23:49.834
He's lost his mind.

23:49.887 --> 23:51.093
Did he hit his head?
- Yeah!

23:51.138 --> 23:52.674
That head thing sounds right.

23:52.890 --> 23:54.346
He is lying!

23:54.683 --> 23:56.265
I told you!
- Yeah, he's lying!

23:56.352 --> 23:58.764
Yeah, that's probably it.
- He probably hit his head...

23:58.812 --> 24:02.146
I know it sounds insane,
but in the fairy tale...

24:02.191 --> 24:03.932
Shut up! That's enough!

24:04.068 --> 24:07.857
I will show you what happens
when people lie to the King.

24:08.238 --> 24:10.570
Guards!
Throw him in the dungeon.

24:10.783 --> 24:14.492
You don't understand,
we need to hurry.

24:14.703 --> 24:16.410
Mila is in danger.

24:16.872 --> 24:19.409
Shut up, you filthy peasant.

24:19.500 --> 24:21.992
RUSLAN: No! Please,
I'm telling the truth!

24:22.294 --> 24:23.204
<i>Let me gm!</i>

24:24.129 --> 24:25.665
Listen to me, I'm not crazy...

24:26.590 --> 24:29.207
My lord, so what do we do?

24:32.012 --> 24:35.175
Good people,
listen to the King's decree.

24:35.474 --> 24:38.466
The one who brings the princess
home safe and sound

24:38.727 --> 24:40.559
will become her husband!

24:52.074 --> 24:55.032
You are obviously not right
in the head, tramp

24:55.119 --> 24:58.908
to try and put one over on
the King in front of everybody.

24:59.123 --> 25:01.990
But I did not lie!
You have to believe me!

25:02.167 --> 25:04.033
Oh, no, from now on

25:04.086 --> 25:06.373
it's prison rats
who will believe you.

25:06.547 --> 25:10.085
Yeah, they're very, very
trustful!

25:10.217 --> 25:11.503
THEY LAUGH

25:12.594 --> 25:13.755
Huh?

25:16.432 --> 25:17.888
THEY COUGH

25:19.268 --> 25:20.133
Oh!

25:20.269 --> 25:21.134
<i>HEY -</i>

25:23.480 --> 25:24.720
Oooh!
- Ahhh!

25:28.986 --> 25:31.227
You... What do you think
you're doing?

25:31.363 --> 25:32.853
Oh, pardon me!

25:32.906 --> 25:35.443
But I shall have to cancel
my tour with the rats

25:35.492 --> 25:36.482
of your prison!

25:36.869 --> 25:37.734
HE LAUGHS

25:40.456 --> 25:41.491
Is this all you've--

25:41.540 --> 25:42.405
Bleurgh!

25:43.876 --> 25:45.162
Let's go and see Lestor!

25:45.627 --> 25:47.209
Yaargh! Oh...

25:50.382 --> 25:51.713
HORSE NEIGHS

26:02.436 --> 26:03.722
Euurgh! Oh!

26:03.812 --> 26:04.802
How dare you!

26:10.611 --> 26:12.898
MAN: So... which way
should we go from here?

26:12.946 --> 26:14.311
MAN 2:
Not sure which way...

26:14.531 --> 26:17.819
Who knows where to find
the princess, hm?

26:20.913 --> 26:21.869
Oh, Ruslan!

26:22.456 --> 26:24.914
<i>Where have you been'?
- Lester, â€œstem to me'.!</i>

26:24.958 --> 26:27.416
Where did you learn
the fairy tale about Chernomor?

26:27.503 --> 26:29.085
What do you mean "where?"

26:29.254 --> 26:30.289
Right here.

26:30.380 --> 26:32.917
It was generated
by my rich imagination.

26:33.050 --> 26:34.131
Tell me the truth!

26:34.760 --> 26:37.343
What's your problem anyway?
I am telling you.

26:37.387 --> 26:38.627
I made it all up.

26:38.722 --> 26:41.339
The problem is that Chernomor
really does exist

26:41.433 --> 26:43.800
and today,
he kidnapped the princess.

26:43.894 --> 26:45.760
What? You gotta be kidding.

26:47.898 --> 26:49.388
Looks like you're not kidding.

26:49.733 --> 26:50.643
Alright then.

26:50.901 --> 26:53.393
But you have to promise
that you won't tell anyone.

26:53.445 --> 26:54.355
<i>Lester'.!</i>

26:55.322 --> 26:58.485
Alright! I had a bad case
of writer's block once.

26:59.284 --> 27:02.652
Well, I just couldn't come up
with anything, you know?

27:02.913 --> 27:03.994
It was real torture.

27:04.456 --> 27:05.366
<i>Lester'.!</i>

27:05.582 --> 27:08.199
Basically, there was this book
that I...

27:09.044 --> 27:10.205
borrowed...

27:10.838 --> 27:12.328
and in the book, I read...

27:12.589 --> 27:15.251
Did this book say anything
about where to find him

27:15.300 --> 27:17.211
or maybe how to defeat him?

27:17.511 --> 27:18.876
No, nothing like that.

27:19.346 --> 27:21.883
But there was this
hilarious story

27:21.932 --> 27:25.175
about a huge toad who,
when kissed, turns you into-â€”

27:25.310 --> 27:26.926
Who did you steal the book from?

27:27.146 --> 27:28.181
Borrowed.

27:28.438 --> 27:31.851
Oh, I get it.
Don't even think about it!

27:32.151 --> 27:35.109
The owner of the book is a scary
and dangerous person

27:35.154 --> 27:36.770
so you better stay away
from him.

27:37.072 --> 27:39.564
I am still trying to forget
the way to his house.

27:39.741 --> 27:41.857
So you haven't forgotten
where he is?

27:42.035 --> 27:44.652
No, I remember completely,
like it was yesterday...

27:44.705 --> 27:45.570
Ah!

27:46.165 --> 27:47.030
Argh!

27:47.082 --> 27:48.914
My tongue is my own worst enemy.

27:49.293 --> 27:51.830
Why do you even care
about this princess anyway?

27:52.045 --> 27:54.537
I'll tell you on the way.
Are you with me?

27:55.257 --> 27:56.793
Do I even have a choice?

27:57.259 --> 27:59.296
Hee-yah!
- HORSE NEIGHS

28:01.221 --> 28:03.838
THEY BICKER

28:04.099 --> 28:05.806
FARLAF:
I have been right all along!

28:06.476 --> 28:09.184
Oh, this is just impossible.

28:09.271 --> 28:10.682
What is impossible?

28:10.731 --> 28:13.393
These morons have no idea
which way to go.

28:13.942 --> 28:16.024
Then why do we need
them anyway, huh?

28:16.069 --> 28:18.026
Let's go on our own.
- Idiot!

28:18.113 --> 28:20.320
We don't know which way
to go either.

28:20.616 --> 28:22.983
Oh. OK, so, who knows then?

28:23.243 --> 28:24.199
<i>Uh...</i>

28:25.871 --> 28:27.032
Ho-ho-ho!

28:27.080 --> 28:29.947
Maybe our little buffoon
friend does!

28:30.542 --> 28:31.407
Follow me!

28:33.212 --> 28:36.079
THEY BICKER

28:36.840 --> 28:38.001
Where are they going?

28:38.383 --> 28:39.248
Shut up!

28:39.551 --> 28:41.383
They... they know something!

28:41.637 --> 28:42.718
Let's follow them.

28:43.222 --> 28:45.429
Hee-yah! After them!
- That is what I said.

28:45.557 --> 28:46.422
L-lee-yah!

28:51.897 --> 28:52.762
L-lee-yah!

28:53.899 --> 28:55.139
Whoaaa!

29:01.698 --> 29:02.563
Waargh g

29:03.075 --> 29:03.940

29:35.816 --> 29:36.681
Giddy up!

29:37.401 --> 29:38.311
Whoaaa!

29:48.870 --> 29:49.735
Hello?

29:50.455 --> 29:51.320
Hello!

29:51.581 --> 29:53.117
Huh?
- Is anybody home?

29:54.167 --> 29:55.032
<i>Wow...</i>

30:01.633 --> 30:03.874
Oh, well.
Looks like nobody's home.

30:04.469 --> 30:06.801
So we gave it a try,
it didn't work

30:07.055 --> 30:09.092
so we might as well, uh,
get outta here.

30:10.142 --> 30:13.225
BOOMING VOICE: The mousetrap
just snapped shut.

30:13.687 --> 30:16.850
I remember you, you weevil.

30:18.650 --> 30:21.813
Looks like payday
has finally arrived, hm?

30:22.070 --> 30:24.528
We are done for!

30:28.243 --> 30:29.859
Aaah... ah!

30:31.496 --> 30:33.908
FOOTSTEPS APPROACH

30:41.715 --> 30:43.922
Huh! So this is it?

30:44.259 --> 30:45.499
This is your monster?

30:46.678 --> 30:47.543
<i>Oh...</i>

30:48.138 --> 30:50.630
Not frightening enough for you?

30:50.849 --> 30:52.715
Please forgive me, my dear,
uh...

30:52.893 --> 30:53.758
Mr Cat.

30:53.810 --> 30:54.675

Is that better?

31:04.571 --> 31:05.436
<i>Uh...</i>

31:05.739 --> 31:07.104
Yeah, that'll do it.

31:14.247 --> 31:15.954
CAT ROARS

We need to calm him down

31:54.162 --> 31:56.073
<i>Uh... sour cream, catnip...</i>

31:56.248 --> 31:57.113
birds?

31:57.874 --> 31:59.956
Clearly you're not an option.
Uh...

32:00.085 --> 32:01.041
bring me that map!

32:04.464 --> 32:06.330
Ah! Ahhh!

Ruslan, do something!

32:10.762 --> 32:11.627
Please!

32:12.347 --> 32:15.089
Yeah, hang on a minute!
- I don't have a minute!

Shoo, shoo, now! Please!

32:39.166 --> 32:40.782
Enough already! No more!

32:41.209 --> 32:43.621
Mr Cat,
can you please hear us out?

32:43.712 --> 32:46.170
Alright, I'll hear you out.

32:46.214 --> 32:48.581
Just get that thing
out of my face!

32:48.717 --> 32:51.129
I can't take it anymore!

32:53.263 --> 32:55.049
You have one minute.

32:55.390 --> 32:57.552
We wanted to return your book.

32:58.185 --> 32:59.050
Aaaah!

32:59.811 --> 33:00.676
<i>Ah...</i>

33:01.480 --> 33:02.936
And to apologise.

33:03.273 --> 33:04.934
Anything else?

33:05.150 --> 33:07.391
No. Well, you see, Chernomor...

33:07.444 --> 33:08.400
Chernomor?

33:08.945 --> 33:11.778
Oh, dear,
did he kidnap a girl again?

33:11.990 --> 33:13.606
Well... yes.

33:13.658 --> 33:15.695
And you want to rescue her?

33:15.911 --> 33:16.821
Exactly!

33:16.912 --> 33:19.529
Ah!
- You've got to be kidding me!

33:20.123 --> 33:23.457
Chernomor
has destroyed entire armies

33:23.502 --> 33:25.334
and decapitated giants.

33:25.378 --> 33:26.584
And now you...

33:26.963 --> 33:27.953
HE SNIFFS

33:28.006 --> 33:31.419
An actor and a troubadour...
HE CHUCKLES

33:31.635 --> 33:33.421
suddenly decide...

33:33.929 --> 33:35.511
So you don't know
how to defeat him?

33:35.722 --> 33:37.304
I didn't say that.

33:37.516 --> 33:38.927
Then you do know?

33:38.975 --> 33:40.386
I didn't say that, either.

33:41.811 --> 33:42.767
Follow me.

33:48.276 --> 33:49.516
BELL RINGS

33:54.074 --> 33:55.109
Clean up.

34:02.541 --> 34:06.626
Once every hundred years,
during the Crimson Sunset

34:06.878 --> 34:10.542
Chernomor kidnaps a princess
who has fallen in love

34:10.966 --> 34:15.551
to replenish his magical powers
with the power of her love.

34:16.012 --> 34:18.174
So is Mila in love, too?

34:18.598 --> 34:20.635
All lovers are blind.

34:21.184 --> 34:25.643
But to answer your question,
all signs point to you

34:25.688 --> 34:27.600
being the object of her love.

34:28.108 --> 34:29.563
Oh, are you sure?

34:30.110 --> 34:33.273
That's something
you'd have to ask her yourself.

34:33.362 --> 34:35.900
"All lovers are blind"...

34:36.199 --> 34:38.690
Oh, do I have to put an
exclamation point after that?

34:38.909 --> 34:42.277
Anyway, Romeo...
You only have two days

34:42.330 --> 34:43.741
to rescue your beloved.

34:43.790 --> 34:45.246
Only two days?

34:45.917 --> 34:49.159
But where can I find her
and how do I stop Chernomor?

34:49.295 --> 34:51.879
Easy, troubadour. I don't know.

34:52.215 --> 34:53.876
But I thought you did!

34:54.134 --> 34:54.998
Nope.

34:55.594 --> 34:57.631
But I know someone who does.

34:58.221 --> 34:59.632
Are you following?

35:00.307 --> 35:01.297
Fin!

35:01.391 --> 35:03.132
But if you want to find him

35:04.519 --> 35:07.432
you will have to travel
to a strange land.

35:07.522 --> 35:09.138
A strange land?

35:09.274 --> 35:12.392
Oh, my goodness, a strange land?
Not again!

35:12.611 --> 35:17.105
Not just some strange land,
but a very magical one.

35:17.616 --> 35:20.199
I would journey to the end
of the Earth for Mila.

35:20.452 --> 35:21.567
Brave lad.

35:22.329 --> 35:24.411
But look, I've seen many
brave men

35:24.456 --> 35:26.288
venture to Chernomor's land

35:26.374 --> 35:29.207
but not a single one returned.

35:29.753 --> 35:32.620
Still, if you've already
made up your mind

35:32.881 --> 35:33.996
here you go...

35:34.299 --> 35:35.881
GONG RINGS

35:36.676 --> 35:38.917
Let's work, lazy bones.

35:39.179 --> 35:41.045
Here's another brave fool

35:41.139 --> 35:43.597
who doesn't know
when to call it quits!

35:44.017 --> 35:45.303
What are you looking at?

35:45.894 --> 35:47.760
Here are your new clients.

35:48.355 --> 35:49.971
Ah, I almost forgot.

35:50.607 --> 35:54.396
When you get to the other side,
it will be quite simple.

35:54.569 --> 35:56.276
Just go straight ahead

35:56.363 --> 35:58.354
and when you can't go
any further

35:58.865 --> 35:59.821
use this.

35:59.991 --> 36:02.403
Thank you. I wish I could
repay you somehow.

36:02.535 --> 36:03.946
Do not mention it.

36:04.537 --> 36:07.495
I, for one, think that this
is a suicide mission

36:08.083 --> 36:10.916
and also, about this...

36:12.045 --> 36:14.662
don't ever tell anyone about it.

36:15.590 --> 36:17.501
I will be as silent
as the grave.

36:17.592 --> 36:18.582
THE CAT CHUCKLES

36:18.802 --> 36:22.340
Oh, boy, I'm afraid that soon
you will literally be as silent

36:22.389 --> 36:23.595
as the grave.

36:24.474 --> 36:25.509
WHOOSHING

36:25.600 --> 36:29.343
Now, do you need
a special invitation?

36:29.771 --> 36:31.307
No-no-no, I'm coming.

36:32.065 --> 36:33.647
Magic butt kick!

36:33.817 --> 36:34.727
Aaaah!

36:46.454 --> 36:48.070
Doesn't look too difficult.

36:48.707 --> 36:53.201
Well, I don't know,
all I feel is danger.

36:53.920 --> 36:56.252
Have you noticed
how dangerous they are?

36:56.840 --> 36:59.207
What a predatory grin!

37:00.885 --> 37:02.171
Huh?
- Let's go.

37:02.804 --> 37:04.886
I'm sure that everything
will turn out fine.

37:05.348 --> 37:07.760
Perhaps you'll be able
to base your brilliant play

37:07.809 --> 37:08.799
on our adventures.

37:09.686 --> 37:11.677
With no fear or remorse

37:11.813 --> 37:14.646
they navigated
right into the jaws of death!

37:15.942 --> 37:18.400
RUSLAN: Well, so much
for a romantic comedy.

37:24.492 --> 37:25.527
MALE VOICE:
Heh...

37:26.494 --> 37:28.326
MILA:
Ruslan? Is that you?

37:28.538 --> 37:29.653
CHERNOMOR SNIGGERS

37:30.039 --> 37:30.904
Aaah!

37:31.624 --> 37:32.864
Hush, hush!

37:33.126 --> 37:34.867
So it's you who kidnapped me?

37:34.919 --> 37:37.126
Oh, why use such
coarse language?

37:37.172 --> 37:40.255
The term "relocated"
is much better.

37:40.800 --> 37:42.632
And now you want to marry me?

37:43.052 --> 37:44.588
What? Marry you?

37:44.637 --> 37:45.968
UQh!No!

37:46.347 --> 37:49.305
I despise such outdated cliches!

37:49.476 --> 37:52.184
Can a woman only be kidnapped
for the purpose

37:52.228 --> 37:53.468
of marrying her?

37:53.730 --> 37:55.016
Hahaha!
- Ha-ha...

37:55.064 --> 37:56.600
Well, yeah, ha-ha...

37:56.733 --> 37:58.519
Marriage? No way!

37:58.651 --> 38:01.985
Hahaha!
- Ha! Oh! Thank goodness then!

38:02.572 --> 38:05.735
This will be kinda
like a marriage, only better

38:05.867 --> 38:07.232
for me! Haha!

38:07.410 --> 38:10.277
I will simply remove
the power of your love

38:10.330 --> 38:12.867
and then turn you
into a stone statue.

38:13.082 --> 38:14.743
It will look something
like that.

38:14.876 --> 38:15.741
Or like that!

38:15.877 --> 38:17.459
Oh, or maybe that one!
- What?

38:17.796 --> 38:20.003
Did you say
turn me into a stone statue?

38:20.590 --> 38:23.423
Oh... did I say that out loud?

38:23.676 --> 38:25.963
Don't be nervous. It won't hurt.

38:26.471 --> 38:27.961
Here, have a cookie.

38:28.056 --> 38:30.423
Here, let me show what I'll do
with your cookie!

38:32.310 --> 38:33.175
Hey!

38:33.269 --> 38:35.101
You missed,
you hysterical woman!

38:35.855 --> 38:37.061
Ow! Oh!

38:37.482 --> 38:38.938
Hahaha!

38:38.983 --> 38:41.065
Oh!
- Hahaha!

38:41.903 --> 38:43.109
This is war!

38:47.033 --> 38:48.194
Ah! Ow!

38:51.204 --> 38:52.194
Huh?

38:54.916 --> 38:56.998
Is this the Cap of Invisibility?

38:58.378 --> 39:00.494
CHERNOMOR:
Now, this is not funny anymore.

39:02.257 --> 39:04.419
Give me back the cap!
Do you hear me?

39:04.592 --> 39:05.798
Where are you?

39:10.431 --> 39:11.296
0w!

39:14.978 --> 39:16.139
Where are you going?

39:16.396 --> 39:18.137
You're foolish
if you think you can escape

39:18.189 --> 39:19.350
from my castle!

39:20.066 --> 39:22.808
MILA: Then I will hide until
Ruslan comes to rescue rne!

39:23.570 --> 39:27.313
Ha! Mortals have never been able
to find my castle!

39:27.532 --> 39:29.364
Remember this! Never!

39:30.243 --> 39:32.826
Oh, such uncouth behaviour.

39:33.538 --> 39:37.327
Well, I'll make sure
that you don't get bored.

39:39.878 --> 39:42.336
<i>Caramelus pastila...</i>

39:42.547 --> 39:46.006
Monster cand/s, tru-la-Ia!

39:47.760 --> 39:50.422
Oh, you, my sweet minion

39:50.680 --> 39:52.466
go find this brat.

39:53.016 --> 39:56.179
"Until Ruslan comes
to rescue me."

39:56.519 --> 39:57.884
Bring her to me at once!

39:58.313 --> 39:59.599
And you, my dear...

40:00.315 --> 40:01.476
Be cruel!

40:01.566 --> 40:02.476
GURGLING

40:07.488 --> 40:10.731
Let's take a look
where our guest has gone.

40:13.286 --> 40:14.151
Ah!

40:14.412 --> 40:15.698
There you are.

40:15.747 --> 40:18.455
<i>AUTOMATED VOICE:
Intruders! Intruders!</i>

40:18.499 --> 40:19.739
What is going on?

40:19.792 --> 40:21.829
<i>Humans arrived
through the portal.</i>

40:22.170 --> 40:24.127
You never know
who that might be.

40:24.505 --> 40:26.712
<i>Hus/an. Les tor.</i>

40:27.091 --> 40:29.708
<i>One brave, one scared.</i>

40:30.345 --> 40:31.210
<i>Oh...</i>

40:31.304 --> 40:33.796
Ruslan sounds familiar.

40:33.932 --> 40:35.969
I think I've heard that name...

40:36.059 --> 40:37.766
HE GASPS
Oh, no!

40:38.019 --> 40:41.478
Ruslan! So he did come
to rescue her.

40:42.357 --> 40:47.523
Oh well, then I must buy flowers
for your funeral, Ruslan.

40:47.737 --> 40:49.728
Muahahaha!

40:49.822 --> 40:52.439
Haha...
HE COUGHS

40:57.080 --> 40:58.912
BANGING

41:01.584 --> 41:03.450
That's some doghouse right here.

41:03.753 --> 41:05.084
MAN 2:
Smells like cat...

41:05.505 --> 41:08.623
MAN:
Oh, What is that? A kitty?

41:08.925 --> 41:10.290
I am a cat!

41:10.385 --> 41:12.171
A talking kitty to boot!

41:12.512 --> 41:14.503
What are you meowing about,
fleabag?

41:14.555 --> 41:18.514
We didn't see the buffoon leave
this place, so...

41:18.768 --> 41:22.511
there must be a secret
passageway somewhere.

41:22.939 --> 41:25.772
Alright, furball,
we know a certain troubadour

41:25.817 --> 41:27.808
paid you a visit earlier today.

41:27.944 --> 41:31.187
Where is he? Where did he go?
- CAT SIGHS

41:31.280 --> 41:33.817
And I've only just finished
cleaning up.

41:34.075 --> 41:35.565
Just a second.

41:41.874 --> 41:44.536
OK. Let's roll.

41:45.253 --> 41:48.496
MUSIC: "The Blue Danube Waltz"
by Johann Strauss II

42:23.499 --> 42:28.869
Ahh... and now some down time.

42:37.513 --> 42:38.844
So, here we are.

42:39.015 --> 42:41.222
It looks like there's nowhere
to go, right?

42:41.726 --> 42:45.014
It looks like we should have
at least picked up some berries.

42:45.063 --> 42:46.178
I'm starving.

42:46.272 --> 42:49.435
Lestor, how can you be thinking
about food

42:49.484 --> 42:50.565
at a time like this?

42:50.651 --> 42:52.141
Oh, that is it!

42:52.612 --> 42:54.398
I'm going to go find
something to eat

42:54.447 --> 42:56.358
and you can stay here
and figure out

42:56.407 --> 42:59.775
whether there's nowhere to go
or somewhere to go.

43:00.036 --> 43:03.279
Man, oh, man! What have we
gotten ourselves into?

43:16.094 --> 43:17.676
FARLAF:
Very strange.

43:26.187 --> 43:27.268
Achoo!

43:27.522 --> 43:28.387
Whoa!

43:28.856 --> 43:30.187
We are under attack!

43:33.903 --> 43:34.984
On, I'm flying!

43:37.573 --> 43:39.189
Oops. Sorry.

43:42.954 --> 43:44.865
We have to follow the clown!

43:47.208 --> 43:49.074
FARLAF CHUCKLES

44:10.106 --> 44:12.473
So... there's no way
to the other side?

44:12.608 --> 44:13.723
SHE CHIRPS

44:13.776 --> 44:15.938
Then we'll have to use the gift
that the cat gave us.

44:17.738 --> 44:19.979
But how to use it?
Maybe we just...

44:23.411 --> 44:24.697
Oh. No.

44:26.330 --> 44:28.697
Maybe it's also magical,
and we have to ask it?

44:28.791 --> 44:29.997
You know, very politely.

44:30.251 --> 44:31.616
SHE CHIRPS

44:32.461 --> 44:33.326
Ahem.

44:33.921 --> 44:35.286
Oh, the greatest...

44:35.631 --> 44:36.996
and greenest...

44:37.258 --> 44:38.373
bean pOd!

44:39.093 --> 44:40.834
Please, be so merciful

44:41.262 --> 44:44.550
and show us, the lost travellers

44:44.932 --> 44:47.173
the way to the wise wizard!

44:48.436 --> 44:51.224
Oh, the greatest... bean pod!

44:51.689 --> 44:52.895
SHE CHIRPS
- HE SIGHS

44:52.940 --> 44:54.522
Yeah, you're right,
it's idiotic.

44:54.567 --> 44:56.149
We gotta think
of something better.

44:57.486 --> 44:58.442
Hmm...

44:58.696 --> 44:59.561
<i>Uh...</i>

45:02.909 --> 45:05.571
SHE CHIRPS

45:10.458 --> 45:11.493
Yes, sure!

45:11.709 --> 45:14.076
As in that fairy tale
about the bean pod!

45:14.170 --> 45:15.035
<i>And now...</i>

45:16.964 --> 45:19.251
Well, one, two...

45:20.468 --> 45:21.424
We need water.

45:23.679 --> 45:24.544
Yeah!

45:24.639 --> 45:25.629
Oh!

45:26.349 --> 45:27.214
Where?

45:27.391 --> 45:28.256
Where'd it go?

45:28.768 --> 45:30.805
You little, dirty, woollen thief!

45:39.695 --> 45:41.026
Grab that hamster!

45:45.660 --> 45:46.866
Alright...

45:47.662 --> 45:48.527
Huh?

46:16.357 --> 46:17.347
Hehe! Nyah!

46:43.426 --> 46:44.507
Now you'll get it!

46:59.900 --> 47:01.265
Ah! Oh, really?

47:01.319 --> 47:02.684
So you know how to fly?

47:02.820 --> 47:03.685
Ah!

47:05.781 --> 47:06.646
Huh?

47:10.911 --> 47:11.821
And this one!

47:11.912 --> 47:13.368
HEDGEHOG:
Aaaaah!

47:14.040 --> 47:15.826
HAMSTER, MUFFLED:
Hehehe!

47:23.466 --> 47:25.127
Aaaaaah <i>...</i>

47:25.259 --> 47:28.092
aaaaaaah!

47:28.512 --> 47:29.377
Eh?

47:32.933 --> 47:35.265
SHE CHIRPS
- OK, calm down.

47:35.311 --> 47:36.176
Enough!

47:36.687 --> 47:37.802
Now, that was too rough!

47:38.356 --> 47:39.437
Maybe he's just hungry?

47:39.982 --> 47:42.770
We're not greedy, but we need
this pod - not for food.

47:43.194 --> 47:45.686
Somehow, it should show us
the way to wizard Fin.

47:46.072 --> 47:46.937
But how?

47:47.907 --> 47:49.318
That one, we don't know yet.

47:49.867 --> 47:51.699
What? You know it?

47:59.335 --> 48:00.450
Won't you run away?

48:01.629 --> 48:02.915
SHE CHIRPS

48:02.963 --> 48:05.204
What if we're supposed
to give it to the hamster?

48:05.716 --> 48:06.581
Here.

48:10.721 --> 48:11.586
<i>Oh...</i>

48:12.098 --> 48:12.963
Huh?

48:25.611 --> 48:27.397
That is unbelievable!

48:42.711 --> 48:44.827
Hey, do you think
we're supposed to eat these?

48:45.673 --> 48:46.583
Waaah!

48:47.174 --> 48:48.835
Huh?
So you're just gonna...

48:49.468 --> 48:51.129
walk right in there?
- Come on!

48:51.220 --> 48:53.052
Kind of like a blind
trust thing, huh?

48:53.722 --> 48:55.383
I'm coming! I'm coming!

49:00.729 --> 49:01.594
0w!

49:04.108 --> 49:04.973
<i>Whoa...</i>

49:07.695 --> 49:09.402
Where did all that come from?

49:11.949 --> 49:14.031
Ah, who cares? I'm so hungry!

49:15.202 --> 49:16.613
<i>~</i> Oh!

49:16.745 --> 49:18.156

49:22.126 --> 49:23.082
Stop!

49:24.420 --> 49:25.285
No!

49:26.005 --> 49:26.870
Aaah!

49:38.684 --> 49:40.140
Killer candy!

49:40.186 --> 49:41.597
Aaaah!

49:47.860 --> 49:48.770
Get off!

49:54.533 --> 49:55.568
Get off!

49:56.243 --> 49:57.153
Back off!

49:59.330 --> 50:00.240
Give it to me!

50:00.873 --> 50:02.079
No!

50:03.709 --> 50:04.574
Hehehe...

50:06.337 --> 50:07.793
That's it!

50:11.342 --> 50:12.878
Now I'm really mad!

50:15.763 --> 50:16.844
Aargh!

50:23.938 --> 50:25.520
CUPCAKES:
Ohhh! Yay!

50:29.068 --> 50:30.524
Is that all you can do?

50:39.370 --> 50:40.235
Oops.

50:49.672 --> 50:50.662
Heh-heh-heh!

50:50.881 --> 50:53.543
Wow, I knew sweets were bad
for your health

50:53.592 --> 50:55.299
but this is ridiculous.

50:57.763 --> 50:58.628
Hm!

50:59.265 --> 51:00.175
Rrrrr...

51:01.308 --> 51:03.094
Hm!
- Mmmm.

51:07.565 --> 51:08.851
SLICING NOISES

51:09.692 --> 51:10.648
Ugh!

51:13.529 --> 51:14.394
Ha.

51:15.197 --> 51:19.407
Haha! And that's how princesses
deal with extra calories.

51:19.827 --> 51:20.692
Huh?

51:21.620 --> 51:23.782
Here you are,
my sweet little brat!

51:27.751 --> 51:28.616
Heheu.

51:31.130 --> 51:32.040
Mmm.

51:38.220 --> 51:40.177
LESTOR:
Wait! Stop!

51:40.514 --> 51:42.551
I do not trust this hamster.

51:42.683 --> 51:43.969
Why?
- Why!

51:44.226 --> 51:45.512
Did you see that bridge?

51:45.603 --> 51:48.140
What if its hungry relatives
are hiding in this cave?

51:48.439 --> 51:51.272
If you're so afraid...
stay here.

51:52.109 --> 51:52.974
<i>Uh...</i>

CREATURE HOWLS

51:55.904 --> 51:56.860
<i>Uh...</i>

51:56.905 --> 51:59.818
On the other hand,
this hamster looks very sincere.

52:00.618 --> 52:02.154
Wait for me!

52:03.245 --> 52:05.111
CHERNOMOR GRUNTS

52:10.419 --> 52:11.875
This is too little.

52:12.129 --> 52:14.962
However, it will be sufficient
to destroy

52:15.049 --> 52:18.587
a couple of measly human souls.

52:27.478 --> 52:31.392
<i>Pustus, moccus, coolibokus.</i>

No! No, wait!

53:11.647 --> 53:12.637
What's wrong with him?

53:13.023 --> 53:13.888
Coo-coo!

53:14.441 --> 53:16.808
Fin! We come in peace!

53:17.236 --> 53:18.897
FIN:
Away! Go away!

53:18.946 --> 53:21.108
I am a mighty sorcerer!

53:21.365 --> 53:23.572
I will bewitch you! Death!

53:23.659 --> 53:24.899
Death to all of you!

53:25.035 --> 53:27.777
Aren't you Fin,
the great wizard?

53:27.955 --> 53:31.243
I've come to--
- Ah, you want to bewitch me!

53:31.291 --> 53:33.828
But I won't listen to you.

53:33.919 --> 53:36.126
Blah-blah-blah!

53:36.672 --> 53:38.663
Blah-blah-blah!
- So what should we do with him?

53:38.966 --> 53:40.798
Can we take him out
with a stone?

53:41.385 --> 53:43.342
SHE CHIRPS
- What?

53:43.554 --> 53:45.170
I'm good at throwing stones.

53:45.264 --> 53:46.925
Raaaaa-ha-ha!

53:46.974 --> 53:48.556
I will bewitch you!

53:48.934 --> 53:51.175
Get lost!

53:51.353 --> 53:52.514
I need to think.

53:53.355 --> 53:54.265
Hmm...

53:54.314 --> 53:55.930
Ah! I have an idea.

54:00.320 --> 54:02.482
We will start
casting spells now!

54:02.906 --> 54:05.068
And if you don't manage
to do it first

54:05.242 --> 54:07.074
we will bewitch you!

54:07.161 --> 54:09.402
I will bewitch you right now!

54:09.538 --> 54:10.824
Death to all of you!

54:11.248 --> 54:14.115
OK. We're starting the spell
now!

54:14.501 --> 54:17.368
Abracadabra!

54:17.546 --> 54:19.253
I will bring death upon you!

54:19.339 --> 54:20.829
Then you'd best do it faster

54:20.883 --> 54:23.716
because we have started
casting our spell!

54:23.844 --> 54:24.800
How does it go?

54:25.804 --> 54:30.014
<i>Er... Kekhus, Nekus, Poritekus!</i>

54:30.434 --> 54:33.768
<i>Kekhus, Reakus, Deathtekus!</i>

54:33.812 --> 54:34.973
<i>Ah'. Ooh...</i>

54:35.063 --> 54:35.928
the gods!

54:36.398 --> 54:39.982
He has cast
a deadly spell on me!

54:40.235 --> 54:42.272
I... My strength...

54:42.696 --> 54:43.811
is leaving me.

54:44.615 --> 54:45.480
Aaah...

54:45.866 --> 54:48.574
Me? My spell?

54:49.369 --> 54:50.655
Oh! Ooooh...

54:50.704 --> 54:52.160
HE COUGHS

54:52.206 --> 54:53.696
Oh, heavens!

54:53.999 --> 54:56.331
The hour of my death
has come!

54:56.794 --> 55:00.788
LESTOR: Oh, stars, I'm looking
at you for the last time...

55:01.131 --> 55:05.375
Oh, wind, you'll never
brush against my skin again.

55:05.844 --> 55:10.839
Oh, mountains...
Lovely, brilliant mountains...

55:11.475 --> 55:13.591
creeks... and streams...

55:13.894 --> 55:15.510
andâ€œ.andâ€œ.

55:15.562 --> 55:18.270
Oh, daffodils!
Fragrant and bright.

55:18.524 --> 55:19.514
<i>And. ..
- Lester'.!</i>

55:20.484 --> 55:21.349
Bleurgh!

55:23.403 --> 55:27.192
Has my power been restored?

55:27.407 --> 55:30.945
Aaaah!
I killed those poor people...

55:31.620 --> 55:33.327
Bleh... pfft!

55:37.584 --> 55:39.291
FIN GRUNTS

55:39.962 --> 55:40.827
<i>FIN:
Hey...</i>

55:41.713 --> 55:42.578
Hey!

55:43.423 --> 55:46.165
Are you completely dead?

55:47.886 --> 55:49.001
<i>Oh...</i>

55:49.638 --> 55:52.881
Forgive me, stranger.

55:53.183 --> 55:55.174
RUSLAN:
A-ha! No need to apologise.

55:55.227 --> 55:56.934
Aaaaaaah!
- Ha-ha!

55:57.688 --> 56:00.350
Calm down!
We won't hurt you, Fin.

56:00.649 --> 56:02.265
The great wizard!

56:02.484 --> 56:03.519
Aaaaaaah!

56:04.194 --> 56:07.312
Dear Fin, we will leave you
alone very soon.

56:07.531 --> 56:08.441
Aaaaaah!

56:08.532 --> 56:10.398
But the thing is, Chernomor--

56:10.450 --> 56:11.406
Aaaaah!

56:11.451 --> 56:12.532
Blah-blah!

56:12.578 --> 56:14.615
Chernomor kidnapped the princess

56:14.746 --> 56:16.783
and I need to find out
where he took her.

56:16.957 --> 56:18.038
Do you understand?

56:20.419 --> 56:21.409
An actor!

56:21.795 --> 56:25.208
Moreover, a second
or third-rate actor!

56:25.465 --> 56:27.547
A courageous one, however.

56:27.801 --> 56:30.543
I was courageous too,
much more than you.

56:30.888 --> 56:31.923
But Chernomor!

56:32.306 --> 56:35.014
Chernomor took it all
away from me.

56:35.559 --> 56:37.891
HE SOBS

56:38.437 --> 56:41.304
Chernomor's power
is in his beard

56:41.815 --> 56:43.431
so if you cut it off...

56:44.026 --> 56:46.108
All his sorcery will disappear?

56:46.361 --> 56:48.477
Possibly. Very likely.

56:48.822 --> 56:51.530
But nobody has ever managed
to do that.

56:51.950 --> 56:53.486
So where can I find Chernomor?

56:53.535 --> 56:56.323
His castle stands
among the spiky rocks.

56:56.371 --> 56:59.409
You will not overcome
Chernomor with a regular sword.

56:59.458 --> 57:03.543
To do that, you will need
a special, magic sword.

57:03.629 --> 57:05.996
And I was hoping
this would be an easy deal.

57:06.548 --> 57:09.711
But the sword is protected
by a mighty hero.

57:09.968 --> 57:12.300
If I only had my courage again.

57:12.346 --> 57:13.677
Tell us how to find this sword.

57:15.349 --> 57:18.808
Walk 300 steps east
from the entrance of my cave.

57:18.852 --> 57:20.934
You'll see a shaggy stone,
then turn right

57:20.979 --> 57:22.640
and walk 100 steps straight,
then turn left

57:22.689 --> 57:24.726
walk 200 elbows straight...
- LESTOR: Whoa, slow down!

57:24.816 --> 57:26.978
I'm trying to draw a map.
- 500 squirrel tails

57:27.027 --> 57:29.064
to the five dozen moose steps
till you reach...

57:29.696 --> 57:31.653
a shaggy stone.

57:31.698 --> 57:32.608
HE SNIFFS
Huh?

57:32.658 --> 57:34.740
Wait! The shaggy stone again?

57:34.826 --> 57:36.487
Six hundred steps
with a lynx trot

57:36.578 --> 57:37.659
till you reach a dusk tree

57:37.704 --> 57:39.570
then to the right and straight,
straight and to the right again

57:39.623 --> 57:40.863
towards the hill
on the edge of the steep

57:40.916 --> 57:42.998
and then you'll see
gloomy fields

57:43.043 --> 57:44.454
covered with thick fog.

57:44.628 --> 57:46.915
That is where the sword
is hidden.

57:47.047 --> 57:51.507
And hurry up,
the Crimson Sunset is coming.

57:52.302 --> 57:54.760
So...
Lestor, did you draw a nice map?

57:55.514 --> 57:58.381
Uh... depends on
what you call "nice".

57:59.518 --> 58:02.180
Uh, this is more modern art
than a map.

58:02.479 --> 58:03.719
I can't understand a thing.

58:04.022 --> 58:05.683
Do you understand
how to get there?

58:07.901 --> 58:10.017
Well, you are simply
irreplaceable.

58:10.487 --> 58:11.977
So, what are we waiting for?

58:12.572 --> 58:13.437
Hamster!

58:15.200 --> 58:16.065
Ruslan!

58:17.160 --> 58:18.025
Hey!

58:18.537 --> 58:19.402
Hey, you!

58:20.372 --> 58:21.737
People!

58:23.041 --> 58:23.951
Guys?

58:26.420 --> 58:28.206
Hamster! What's happen... oh!

58:28.630 --> 58:31.793
Why are you all running so fast?
Especially on an empty stomach!

58:31.925 --> 58:33.086
Holy cannoli!

58:34.344 --> 58:36.210
Uh... do you guys think
that's a friendly

58:36.263 --> 58:37.503
"nice to meet you" smile

58:37.556 --> 58:39.593
or an "I'm going to eat you"
smile?

58:41.560 --> 58:43.346
Roooaaafl
- Aaaaah!

58:43.812 --> 58:45.268
Aaaah!

58:48.400 --> 58:49.982
LESTOR: Definitely number two!

58:50.235 --> 58:51.646
Aaaah!

58:51.778 --> 58:53.109
RUSLAN: Run!

58:57.868 --> 58:59.108
THEY GRUMBLE

59:02.247 --> 59:04.284
It looks like we've lost them.

59:04.583 --> 59:06.995
Aaaaaah!

59:07.753 --> 59:09.369
Huh?
_ Run!

59:09.588 --> 59:12.000
Looks like we just found them.

59:12.215 --> 59:13.580
And what was he screaming?

59:14.468 --> 59:15.629
MONSTER HISSES

59:15.677 --> 59:17.463
Oh! Aaaah!

59:36.573 --> 59:38.189
Oh! Ohhhh!

59:39.743 --> 59:40.608
Hello!

59:43.789 --> 59:45.996
<i>FOOTSTEPS RUMBLE</i>

59:55.759 --> 59:56.669
Oh!

59:56.968 --> 59:58.049
<i>Uh...</i>

01:00:02.474 --> 01:00:03.714
Ugh... eurghhhh!

01:00:14.152 --> 01:00:17.144
Oh, you useless heap of stones!

01:00:17.322 --> 01:00:18.232
Aaaah!

01:00:24.162 --> 01:00:27.450
She almost looks... alive.

01:00:29.167 --> 01:00:30.032
<i>Oh...</i>

01:00:40.512 --> 01:00:42.219
LIGHT TWINKLING SOUND

01:00:44.558 --> 01:00:46.799
LESTOR:
Whoa. What happened here?

01:00:47.561 --> 01:00:48.551
A battle.

01:00:49.563 --> 01:00:52.601
Well, obviously
this is no dance party.

01:00:55.402 --> 01:00:57.518
What's over there?
What do you see?

01:00:57.571 --> 01:00:58.436
Shh!

01:00:58.572 --> 01:01:01.360
DISTANT RUMBLE

01:01:03.118 --> 01:01:07.112
SNORE RUMBLES

01:01:08.582 --> 01:01:10.493
Is this your legendary hero?

01:01:11.209 --> 01:01:13.325
Hello! Mr Hero, sir?

01:01:13.837 --> 01:01:15.168
We really need your help!

01:01:16.798 --> 01:01:18.914
Hey, there! Mr Hero?

01:01:22.345 --> 01:01:24.427
Do you have any idea
how to wake him up?

01:01:25.223 --> 01:01:26.884
Let's light up his beard!

01:01:27.475 --> 01:01:29.057
That's not such a good idea.

01:01:29.477 --> 01:01:31.343
LESTOR:
Everybody's a critic! Alright.

01:01:31.396 --> 01:01:33.137
You come up
with something better, then.

01:01:36.401 --> 01:01:38.438
Mm... hrr!
- What's the matter with him?

01:01:38.695 --> 01:01:41.027
Hhh... hrrr!
- Uh...

01:01:41.364 --> 01:01:42.695
Achoo!

01:01:45.702 --> 01:01:46.783
A rat?

01:01:47.662 --> 01:01:49.528
O, the great hero!

01:01:49.789 --> 01:01:51.905
Smells like a rat.

01:01:52.209 --> 01:01:54.496
No, no, no, my name is Ruslan

01:01:55.003 --> 01:01:57.495
and I am an actor--
- Aaaargh!

01:01:57.547 --> 01:01:59.629
There's a rat right there!

01:02:01.343 --> 01:02:05.587
Tell me quickly why you're here,
but first take your rat away.

01:02:05.847 --> 01:02:08.305
Can't you see that I'm allergic?

01:02:09.142 --> 01:02:12.476
I was told that you are
the keeper of a magic sword.

01:02:12.562 --> 01:02:13.848
<i>Eh... eh.</i>

01:02:13.897 --> 01:02:14.978
Alright)'-

01:02:19.653 --> 01:02:21.940
Oh, wow! That was simple.

01:02:23.448 --> 01:02:26.611
"It'll be yours if you're able
to carry it away."

01:02:26.785 --> 01:02:30.278
What is that supposed to mean?
- Here, ask them!

01:02:31.498 --> 01:02:33.990
ZOMBIES GROWL

01:02:34.668 --> 01:02:36.284
But they're dead, aren't they?

01:02:36.461 --> 01:02:37.326
No!

01:02:44.010 --> 01:02:46.172
Let the show begin!

01:02:46.513 --> 01:02:48.254

You know, it really wasn't
that hard after all.

01:03:29.889 --> 01:03:32.972
Oh, how many times

01:03:40.150 --> 01:03:42.812
This I've heard many times, too.

01:03:43.903 --> 01:03:44.768
That's right!

01:03:45.155 --> 01:03:46.862
I know what to do!
- Hmm.

01:03:46.906 --> 01:03:50.069
"I know that to do."
That's new.

01:03:50.118 --> 01:03:51.449
You're my super weapon.

01:03:51.536 --> 01:03:53.868
Hey! What are you up to?

01:03:54.247 --> 01:03:57.490
You, don't you come any closer!

01:03:57.876 --> 01:03:58.832
Take cover!

01:04:21.983 --> 01:04:22.848
Yes!

01:04:23.068 --> 01:04:24.479
We owned them, alright!

01:04:25.945 --> 01:04:28.186
Next stop, Chernomor's castle.

Heh-heh-heh!

01:04:49.052 --> 01:04:49.917
Huh?

01:04:50.678 --> 01:04:53.511
So, you did make it here!

01:04:53.765 --> 01:04:56.507
Moreover, you have the sword!

01:04:57.143 --> 01:05:01.603
My, that's some longing
for this hysterical woman.

01:05:04.192 --> 01:05:05.603
The sun is about to set.

01:05:06.111 --> 01:05:08.478
We have to make it through
these spikes somehow.

01:05:08.780 --> 01:05:11.488
Lestor, you and Hamster
will go to the right

01:05:11.574 --> 01:05:12.905
and I will go to the left

01:05:12.992 --> 01:05:15.609
and whoever finds a passage
first should whistle.

01:05:15.912 --> 01:05:17.073
OK! I'm going.

01:05:17.747 --> 01:05:19.988
Uh, but... I don't know how
to whistle.

01:05:20.250 --> 01:05:21.991
HAMSTER WHISTLES
- Huh!

01:05:22.043 --> 01:05:24.000
Looks like Hamster knows
how to whistle.

01:05:24.045 --> 01:05:25.627
You'd better hope
he can't write plays.

01:05:25.672 --> 01:05:27.254
Very funny!

01:05:27.674 --> 01:05:29.665
Please tell me
you can't write plays.

01:05:29.884 --> 01:05:31.795
Una, go and find Mila.

01:05:31.970 --> 01:05:34.257
Let her know that I am coming
to rescue her.

01:05:34.389 --> 01:05:35.595
SHE CHIRPS

01:05:41.187 --> 01:05:42.018
Oh!

01:05:44.399 --> 01:05:45.309
Mila!

01:05:45.650 --> 01:05:47.015
Did you manage to escape?

01:05:47.485 --> 01:05:50.022
I came to your rescue,
just as I promised.

01:05:50.071 --> 01:05:52.028
You've come? Why?

01:05:52.532 --> 01:05:53.772
What do you mean, why?

01:05:54.159 --> 01:05:56.742
To rescue you!
This is me, Ruslan.

01:05:57.370 --> 01:06:01.830
Ruslan, the poor clown

01:06:01.875 --> 01:06:03.286
about being a great knight

01:06:03.460 --> 01:06:06.327
all to seduce me
and sweep rne off my feet.

01:06:06.796 --> 01:06:08.412
There's no mystery here.

01:06:08.673 --> 01:06:12.462
If you married the princess,
you would become the king.

01:06:12.552 --> 01:06:14.964
Why would any buffoon
pass that up?

01:06:15.138 --> 01:06:17.880
Mila, what are you saying?
I don't recognise you!

01:06:18.516 --> 01:06:20.723
What made you think
you know me at all?

01:06:20.768 --> 01:06:22.224
But it seemed to me that...

01:06:22.353 --> 01:06:25.436
Well, you are right.
It "seemed" to you.

01:06:25.690 --> 01:06:29.604
How could you think that I,
the daughter of the great King

01:06:29.736 --> 01:06:33.274
was really interested
in a poor actor like you?

01:06:33.406 --> 01:06:36.364
And now you've shown up here
to do what?

01:06:36.618 --> 01:06:39.451
To rescue you...
- Ha! Rescue me?

01:06:39.621 --> 01:06:42.454
Ha! But do I want to be rescued?

01:06:42.957 --> 01:06:45.073
- Here, I have everything

01:06:45.126 --> 01:06:46.161
that I need.

01:06:46.252 --> 01:06:49.665
Everything that you would
have never been able to give rne.

01:06:50.006 --> 01:06:54.500
A magnificent castle,
riches, power

01:06:54.844 --> 01:06:56.710
and even love!

01:06:57.180 --> 01:07:00.047
Love?
- Yes, love.

01:07:00.517 --> 01:07:04.385
Chernomor loves me,
and we will get married today!

01:07:04.687 --> 01:07:07.349
And tomorrow,
we will go on a honeymoon trip

01:07:07.398 --> 01:07:08.604
around the world!

01:07:08.942 --> 01:07:11.525
This is what I've dreamed of
my entire life!

01:07:11.736 --> 01:07:13.318
But the blood-coloured sunset--

01:07:13.363 --> 01:07:16.071
Oh, please!
It is just a fairy tale.

01:07:17.075 --> 01:07:19.032
Ruslan, please understand.

01:07:19.452 --> 01:07:23.912
I don't need you.
I love Chernomor!

01:07:24.332 --> 01:07:26.744
And if you have at least
a little bit of honour

01:07:26.793 --> 01:07:27.908
left in you

01:07:28.002 --> 01:07:31.040
you won't stand in the way
of my happiness.

01:07:31.589 --> 01:07:32.954
No, I won't.

01:07:33.299 --> 01:07:34.460
Good boy.

01:07:43.601 --> 01:07:46.138
<i>CHERNOMOR,</i> AS <i>MILA (VO): <i>
The poor clown and buffoon</i></i>

01:07:46.896 --> 01:07:49.388
<i>who lied to me
about being a great knight.</i>

01:07:51.067 --> 01:07:53.104
<i>I love Chernomor!</i>

01:07:56.239 --> 01:07:57.650
Uh, there's nothing here.

01:07:57.865 --> 01:07:59.697
Maybe on your side
there's a way.

01:08:00.451 --> 01:08:01.316
Huh?

01:08:02.787 --> 01:08:03.822
What's wrong with him?

01:08:04.664 --> 01:08:06.371
Ruslan, did you find a passage?

01:08:08.084 --> 01:08:08.949
Ruslan!

01:08:10.712 --> 01:08:11.747
You were right.

01:08:12.755 --> 01:08:15.042
Ha! Holy cannoli, I knew it!

01:08:15.758 --> 01:08:16.792
What am I right about?

01:08:19.136 --> 01:08:20.673
SHE CHIRPS

01:08:23.640 --> 01:08:25.598
Hey, are you here?

01:08:26.060 --> 01:08:27.892
I know that you're here.

01:08:28.104 --> 01:08:30.970
Do you know,
I just met your groom!

01:08:31.232 --> 01:08:34.725
Ruslan, is it? Such a cutie!

01:08:35.153 --> 01:08:39.067
I felt so sorry for him
when he found out that Mila...

01:08:39.866 --> 01:08:42.323
is not interested in him at all.

01:08:42.660 --> 01:08:44.776
Oh, how upset he was!

01:08:44.996 --> 01:08:48.910
My, oh, my, I don't even know
if he will ever recover

01:08:48.957 --> 01:08:50.665
from the heartbreak.

01:08:51.252 --> 01:08:52.242
MILA:
You're lying!

01:08:53.171 --> 01:08:55.287
That's an insult, beauty.

01:08:55.340 --> 01:08:57.671
Look out the window
and see for yourself.

01:08:57.800 --> 01:09:01.794
There is your hero,
waddling home in disgrace.

01:09:02.055 --> 01:09:02.965
MILA:
No!

01:09:03.765 --> 01:09:05.756
Gotcha! Heh-heh-heh!

01:09:08.478 --> 01:09:09.718
Aaaah!
- It's too late

01:09:09.770 --> 01:09:11.136
for flailing about!

01:09:17.362 --> 01:09:20.774
Now, let's go, come with me.

01:09:20.907 --> 01:09:23.113
Let's enjoy the sunset.

01:09:23.158 --> 01:09:25.149
Heh-heh-heh!

01:09:27.913 --> 01:09:31.497
What an idiot I am,
fancying myself worthy.

01:09:31.667 --> 01:09:33.328
SHE CHIRPS

01:09:33.461 --> 01:09:35.292
I've seen it all
with my own eyes.

01:09:36.005 --> 01:09:36.961
Leave me alone!

01:09:37.465 --> 01:09:40.173
Ruslan!
It's not the end of the world.

01:09:40.218 --> 01:09:42.801
MONSTER GROWLS

01:09:43.095 --> 01:09:46.009
Whoa-ho! But that, in fact,
appears to be the case!

01:09:46.224 --> 01:09:47.089
Well...

01:09:47.183 --> 01:09:50.846
this ending totally makes sense
for my stereotypical play.

01:09:51.312 --> 01:09:52.393
I'm ready for it.

01:09:52.647 --> 01:09:53.511
Bring it on!

01:09:53.981 --> 01:09:54.846
No!

01:09:55.650 --> 01:09:56.515
Aargh...

01:09:58.027 --> 01:09:59.062
Hey! Hey!

01:09:59.278 --> 01:10:01.440
I'm here,
you ugly bunch of rocks!

01:10:01.739 --> 01:10:02.695
Uh... here, boy!

01:10:02.990 --> 01:10:04.196
Come get your stone pie!

01:10:04.826 --> 01:10:06.988
Ha, that's a nice joke,
I should write that down...

01:10:07.370 --> 01:10:08.860
Roooaaaaafl

01:10:09.080 --> 01:10:09.945
Oh!

01:10:10.415 --> 01:10:11.280
Aaaaah!

01:10:24.929 --> 01:10:28.593
Get your act together,
this is not the best time to...

01:10:28.641 --> 01:10:29.972
chicken out!

01:10:31.185 --> 01:10:33.347
Look,
you will find someone else!

01:10:34.147 --> 01:10:36.684
Someone in your league,
of your status!

01:10:37.150 --> 01:10:40.017
Whatever happened is no reason
to get so upset!

01:10:40.445 --> 01:10:42.652
But I am upset.

01:10:42.864 --> 01:10:44.901
And this too shall pass!

01:10:45.158 --> 01:10:47.775
Now, go chop that cobble-stone
into pieces!

01:10:47.952 --> 01:10:50.910
But how could she be so cruel
and so cold?

01:10:51.080 --> 01:10:54.869
If you do nothing, the monster
is the one who will be cruel.

01:10:54.917 --> 01:10:58.126
And us? Why, we'll be very cold!

01:10:59.464 --> 01:11:00.374
GLASS SMASHES

01:11:03.176 --> 01:11:05.634
<i>Oh... I... cannot...</i>

01:11:05.970 --> 01:11:07.677
FUD. <i>. .</i> anymore.

01:11:07.889 --> 01:11:09.971
I cannot live without her.

01:11:10.308 --> 01:11:12.219
UNA CHIRPS

01:11:12.268 --> 01:11:13.224
The pendant!

01:11:13.811 --> 01:11:15.017
Where did you get it?

01:11:15.229 --> 01:11:17.095
SHE CHIRPS

01:11:18.065 --> 01:11:20.682
No, she wasn't wearing it...

01:11:21.110 --> 01:11:21.975
Oh!

01:11:23.112 --> 01:11:27.822
Well, deceitful Chernomor,
this will be your last act.

01:11:28.409 --> 01:11:29.365
This is it...

01:11:29.577 --> 01:11:30.942
I just can't... go on.

01:11:34.457 --> 01:11:35.538
Rooooaaafl

01:11:36.626 --> 01:11:38.082
RUSLAN:
Hands off my friends!

01:11:49.639 --> 01:11:52.381
Ha! I think I know how
to get to the castle.

01:11:55.561 --> 01:11:57.598
Lestor, it was a lie.

01:11:57.855 --> 01:12:00.096
The Mila that I saw
was not real.

01:12:00.358 --> 01:12:01.814
She was not wearing this.

01:12:01.984 --> 01:12:03.975
She said she would never
take it off

01:12:04.237 --> 01:12:06.774
so it couldn't have been her
who drove me away!

01:12:07.031 --> 01:12:09.819
And perhaps she is still
waiting for me

01:12:10.076 --> 01:12:12.192
or perhaps even loves me.

01:12:12.537 --> 01:12:13.652
Aren't you glad?

01:12:13.871 --> 01:12:16.203
Oh... I am glad.

01:12:16.624 --> 01:12:17.955
I am very glad.

01:12:18.167 --> 01:12:19.874
Can't you see me clapping?

01:12:20.711 --> 01:12:22.668
There's no time
to be laying around.

01:12:22.839 --> 01:12:25.080
Let's go,
we need to rescue Mila.

01:12:25.299 --> 01:12:26.789
The sun is about to set.

01:12:27.176 --> 01:12:28.541
What did the cat say?

01:12:28.719 --> 01:12:30.551
"All lovers are blind."

01:12:33.182 --> 01:12:35.344
Enough! I've had enough!

01:12:35.810 --> 01:12:38.518
Let it all fall away!
I don't care!

01:12:38.813 --> 01:12:42.602
All these monsters, frogs
and stinking swamp.

01:12:42.650 --> 01:12:43.606
Buffoon!

01:12:43.651 --> 01:12:46.313
Buffoons, princesses and...
buffoon?

01:12:46.863 --> 01:12:48.274
HE GASPS

01:12:48.656 --> 01:12:49.521
Ah!

01:12:49.907 --> 01:12:52.444
Buffoon, oh, there you are!

01:12:53.661 --> 01:12:55.368
How I've missed you.

01:12:57.790 --> 01:13:00.157
You old, ugly, vile--

01:13:00.209 --> 01:13:01.119
Shut up!

01:13:02.128 --> 01:13:03.084
That's it.

01:13:03.504 --> 01:13:06.622
Soon you will become
quiet and obedient.

01:13:06.841 --> 01:13:07.831
Like a pebble!

01:13:08.509 --> 01:13:11.968
There, there...
I will take good care of you.

01:13:12.263 --> 01:13:15.506
Like, blow dust off of you
every once in a while!

01:13:15.766 --> 01:13:17.507
Eh-heh-heh-heh!

01:13:18.853 --> 01:13:19.718
What?

01:13:19.979 --> 01:13:21.720
But... you left!

01:13:21.898 --> 01:13:23.935
Ha! I'm not that dumb.

01:13:24.025 --> 01:13:25.641
HE SCOFFS
Of course you aren't!

01:13:26.319 --> 01:13:28.060
MILA YELLS

01:13:28.112 --> 01:13:29.193
Calm down!

01:13:30.406 --> 01:13:31.271
Mila!

01:13:36.704 --> 01:13:38.365
Whoaaaaa!

01:13:40.583 --> 01:13:41.573
A-ha!

01:13:41.876 --> 01:13:43.583
The magic armour!

01:13:43.794 --> 01:13:46.661
Your sorcery does not affect me.
Give up now!

01:13:46.881 --> 01:13:50.340
You are right.
It doesn't affect you.

01:13:50.718 --> 01:13:52.550
But what about me?

01:13:52.803 --> 01:13:59.470
<i>Akonus, agonus, hugus dragonus!</i>

01:14:04.106 --> 01:14:07.690
So, who is supposed
to give up now?

01:14:30.007 --> 01:14:31.918
You wanna go for a ride?

01:14:32.218 --> 01:14:33.549
Not a problem!

01:14:56.450 --> 01:14:57.485
Whoa!

01:15:01.622 --> 01:15:02.532
Whoaaaa!

01:15:08.004 --> 01:15:09.460
Muahahaha!

01:15:23.728 --> 01:15:24.593
Aaargh!

01:15:35.322 --> 01:15:36.733
Did you lose this?

01:15:38.659 --> 01:15:39.945
No!

01:15:56.052 --> 01:15:57.258
He did it.

01:15:59.972 --> 01:16:00.837
Oh!

01:16:01.557 --> 01:16:02.422
Aaah...

01:16:13.444 --> 01:16:14.525
Huh? No!

01:16:14.862 --> 01:16:15.727
That's it.

01:16:16.238 --> 01:16:18.479
Yeah, you did it! You won!

01:16:18.866 --> 01:16:23.030
Oh, I will dedicate the greatest
poem in human history to you!

01:16:23.204 --> 01:16:26.913
Or a play, or even better,
an ode!

01:16:27.166 --> 01:16:29.032
And I will start writing it
right now!

01:16:29.085 --> 01:16:32.419
There's no time for odes yet.
Mila is still in danger.

01:16:32.588 --> 01:16:34.875
Remove the magic shield!
- Me?

01:16:35.132 --> 01:16:36.543
Hahahaha!

01:16:36.592 --> 01:16:39.050
The process
has been set in motion

01:16:39.095 --> 01:16:41.757
and there is no force
in the whole world

01:16:41.847 --> 01:16:43.258
capable of stopping it.

01:16:43.682 --> 01:16:44.968
Ow! Ouch!

01:16:45.142 --> 01:16:46.428
I will save her.

01:16:46.519 --> 01:16:48.009
Ruslan, you're gonna die!

01:16:48.354 --> 01:16:50.345
A life without Mila
is worse than death.

01:16:56.862 --> 01:16:59.524
This can't be real,
this is my only fear.

01:17:05.287 --> 01:17:06.527
What a great act!

01:17:06.831 --> 01:17:10.119
It's a shame that the actor
won't be able to come out

01:17:10.167 --> 01:17:11.703
for an encore.

01:17:12.461 --> 01:17:13.667
Hahaha--

01:17:20.344 --> 01:17:22.836
GHOSTS MOAN

01:17:24.765 --> 01:17:25.630
Ugh!

01:17:31.856 --> 01:17:33.062
<i>Lester, catch'.!</i>

01:17:40.114 --> 01:17:41.070
Ruslan!

01:17:41.323 --> 01:17:42.313
Mila!

01:17:43.450 --> 01:17:44.940
I...
- Ruslan!

01:17:45.119 --> 01:17:46.951
One more step, I beg you!

01:17:47.705 --> 01:17:49.241
I will rescue you!

01:17:51.208 --> 01:17:53.870
Nobody rescues anyone anymore!

01:17:57.798 --> 01:17:59.414
Aaaaagh!

01:18:00.134 --> 01:18:01.044
Ruslan!

01:18:03.762 --> 01:18:05.378
<i>Finita Ia commedia</i>

01:18:05.931 --> 01:18:07.513
as they say en France.

01:18:07.892 --> 01:18:09.678
There, there, my dear.

01:18:09.977 --> 01:18:12.639
You don't need to mourn
this pathetic clown.

01:18:13.063 --> 01:18:15.430
He is beneath you, unlike me!

01:18:15.816 --> 01:18:19.059
I am a real knight,
with a family tree

01:18:19.111 --> 01:18:20.351
and proper manners

01:18:20.613 --> 01:18:24.481
so you will be very happy
when we get married.

01:18:26.285 --> 01:18:27.696
When we get married?

01:18:27.912 --> 01:18:29.073
SHE WHISPERS:
Plan B!

01:18:29.663 --> 01:18:31.654
Oh, here comes my father!

01:18:32.291 --> 01:18:33.577
Vladimir? Where?

01:18:33.626 --> 01:18:34.616
Here!
- Ow!

01:18:37.880 --> 01:18:39.416
Oh! Aurghm
_

01:19:09.536 --> 01:19:10.947
Huh,huh,huh,aaaah!

01:19:15.626 --> 01:19:16.661
Aaah!

01:19:27.263 --> 01:19:29.129
MILA:
No more Miss Nice Princess!

01:19:48.200 --> 01:19:49.361
Whoaaaa!

01:19:49.660 --> 01:19:51.321
Aaaaaah!
- Eurgh!

01:20:03.090 --> 01:20:04.922
That is so gross!

01:20:06.218 --> 01:20:07.879
What do you think you're...

01:20:11.515 --> 01:20:12.380
Ribbit!

01:20:14.268 --> 01:20:15.133
Ribbit!

01:20:25.070 --> 01:20:26.310
Urgh... eugh...

01:20:30.826 --> 01:20:34.694
Help!

01:20:38.417 --> 01:20:40.579
MILA SOBS

01:20:43.672 --> 01:20:44.662
Ruslan...

01:20:45.215 --> 01:20:46.125
My knight.

01:20:47.468 --> 01:20:49.209
You are the best man on Earth.

01:20:52.639 --> 01:20:53.720
Here I am!

01:20:53.807 --> 01:20:55.889
My power came back to me.

01:20:56.101 --> 01:20:58.183
Hey there,
champions and winners!

01:20:58.354 --> 01:21:00.516
Laurel wreaths for everyone!

01:21:01.231 --> 01:21:04.144
Why's everyone so sour?
We won, didn't we?

01:21:04.485 --> 01:21:05.350
<i>Uh...</i>

01:21:09.573 --> 01:21:10.438
<i>Oh...</i>

01:21:11.075 --> 01:21:12.190
That's not a problem.

01:21:12.242 --> 01:21:13.732
By the way, my name is Fin.

01:21:13.786 --> 01:21:15.902
After all, we've never been
officially introduced.

01:21:15.954 --> 01:21:17.490
Ruslan is dead

01:21:17.748 --> 01:21:19.330
and you don't think
it's a problem?

01:21:19.583 --> 01:21:22.666
Whoa-whoa-whoa!
Calm down, young lady.

01:21:22.711 --> 01:21:24.622
I only meant
that I could fix it all.

01:21:25.005 --> 01:21:25.961
Fix it all?

01:21:26.507 --> 01:21:27.588
Well, yeah.

01:21:27.633 --> 01:21:29.965
By the way,
it should be mentioned that I...

01:21:30.511 --> 01:21:32.093
am a wizard!

01:21:32.262 --> 01:21:35.050
And you...
you can resurrect Ruslan?

01:21:35.391 --> 01:21:38.099
No, I cannot resurrect him

01:21:38.185 --> 01:21:40.722
but I can return
what was stolen from him.

01:21:40.729 --> 01:21:43.141
That's not a problem at all.
Step back...

01:21:43.315 --> 01:21:48.355
In a moment you will witness
real fairy-tale-grade magic.

01:21:48.862 --> 01:21:49.727
<i>Uh...</i>

01:21:50.155 --> 01:21:52.817
<i>Kaladounen, nadalounen</i>

01:21:53.367 --> 01:21:55.779
give him back
what you have stolen.

01:21:56.245 --> 01:21:58.486
No more loss, no more wrack

01:21:58.622 --> 01:22:02.536
his light of life
he should get back!

01:22:08.507 --> 01:22:09.372
<i>Wham'?</i>

01:22:09.842 --> 01:22:10.923
He's breathing!

01:22:11.718 --> 01:22:13.675
Ruslan! You're alive!

01:22:13.846 --> 01:22:17.384
Oh, I am so glad
that you're alive!

01:22:17.433 --> 01:22:18.423
Don't squeeze me.

01:22:19.059 --> 01:22:19.969
Ooh... heh-heh!

01:22:20.477 --> 01:22:22.388
Fin! My love!

01:22:22.729 --> 01:22:23.594
Nina!

01:22:24.106 --> 01:22:25.767
My shining star!

01:22:30.696 --> 01:22:32.186
Mila...
- Yes?

01:22:33.407 --> 01:22:34.568
I need to confess...

01:22:35.075 --> 01:22:37.533
I am not quite a real knight.

01:22:38.662 --> 01:22:39.948
One could even say...

01:22:40.998 --> 01:22:42.363
I am not a knight at all.

01:22:42.958 --> 01:22:45.325
But I really like you,
and I would like...

01:22:45.586 --> 01:22:48.203
if you'd let me,
then I would...

01:22:48.380 --> 01:22:49.495
if you don't mind...

01:22:49.840 --> 01:22:51.296
I don't care who you were.

01:22:51.633 --> 01:22:53.419
I know who you are now.

01:22:53.802 --> 01:22:55.509
You're the one I love!

01:22:56.013 --> 01:22:59.597
And if I asked you to marry me?
What would you say?

01:23:00.350 --> 01:23:01.215
Yes.

01:23:01.685 --> 01:23:03.141
I will say yes!

01:23:05.731 --> 01:23:06.721
I love you.

01:23:10.611 --> 01:23:11.692
Awww!

01:23:14.448 --> 01:23:18.908
It's so beautiful
that I need to write it down!
