Govern.

woods

07:06.452 --> 07:07.987
over by Highway 77.

07:09.920 --> 07:12.854
And so all these women were
found with this marigold crown,

07:12.920 --> 07:14.456

07:14.520 --> 07:15.653

she came over here to...

10:15.925 --> 10:17.493
Could it be retrograde amnesia?

him?

No. No missing persons reports.

10:37.082 --> 10:38.494
for now, I'll just keep him
talking

- and hopefully...
- Uh, Diana,

10:41.794 --> 10:43.860

10:43.926 --> 10:46.527
When was the last time
you had some decent sleep?

Go home, try it.

Doctor's orders.

10:51.025 --> 10:53.727
[Diana] Doctor Herman, have you
ever had a patient like him before?

10:53.794 --> 10:55.460
Personally, no.

10:55.527 --> 10:57.728
But if it really is retrograde
amnesia,

10:58.527 --> 11:01.861
well, the odds of him recovering
his memories are very slim.

Here.

[Diana] It's quite something.

12:12.597 --> 12:14.330
It's gotta be a clue, right?

29:29.764 --> 29:32.331
White male, about 5'9",

29:32.965 --> 29:35.699
slight build, about 37 years
old.

29:36.498 --> 29:37.633
Any defining features?

29:37.699 --> 29:40.398
He's wearing a long sleeved
white shirt,

29:40.466 --> 29:42.132
blue, uh, pajama pants,

29:42.199 --> 29:43.331
brown suede slippers.

29:43.399 --> 29:46.299
[Frank] His face is covered in
bandages.

29:46.499 --> 29:48.399
He also has very deep, blue
eyes.

29:48.599 --> 29:49.432
[officers chuckling]

29:49.504 --> 29:51.566
It might be your type,
but that's not my type.

29:51.647 --> 29:53.332
All I wanna do is hunt this guy
down.

29:53.847 --> 29:54.865
Appreciate your help.

29:54.932 --> 29:56.157
Are you out of your mind?

29:56.251 --> 29:57.499
They printed your name and
everything.

29:57.582 --> 29:59.699
You're either a kidnap victim
or an accessory to murder.

30:04.499 --> 30:05.566
That's so stupid.

30:06.740 --> 30:08.041
You never just show up here,

30:08.650 --> 30:11.433
and with some old friend,
you say, needs time to heal.

30:11.500 --> 30:12.400
I'm sorry.

30:12.442 --> 30:14.400
I'm the only friend you've
ever had and kept, Diana.

30:15.049 --> 30:16.534
[Diana] I'm sorry I lied to you.

30:16.833 --> 30:18.534
I didn't want to get you
involved.

30:18.600 --> 30:19.500
Well...

30:19.699 --> 30:20.733
that didn't work!

30:20.800 --> 30:21.699
I'm very much involved!

30:21.783 --> 30:23.500
There's a serial killer
sleeping in my bed!

30:23.559 --> 30:24.500
He didn't do it.

30:24.551 --> 30:25.536
How do you know that?

30:32.833 --> 30:34.867
You know, you look an awful lot
like his other victims.

30:36.001 --> 30:37.700
Yeah, well,
he had the opportunity to kill me.

30:37.767 --> 30:40.635
We were in the woods alone,
and he had a gun, and he didn't do it.

30:40.700 --> 30:41.700
[sighs]

30:43.201 --> 30:44.301
Diana.

30:46.501 --> 30:47.601
Is this about your dad?

30:47.667 --> 30:49.434
Oh, Jesus Christ, don't worry.

30:49.834 --> 30:52.635
Listen, Diana, I know that it
hurts.

30:53.568 --> 30:54.935
[Thomas] You have to forgive
yourself.

30:55.002 --> 30:56.334
You have to hand him into the
police.

30:56.401 --> 30:58.700
[Diana] No. I have to make sure
it doesn't happen again.

30:59.701 --> 31:00.635
Diana.

31:03.002 --> 31:06.635
I love you. I'll do whatever I need
to do to help you get through this.

31:06.701 --> 31:08.602
You can stay here as long as
you need.

31:09.202 --> 31:10.369
Okay? Just...

31:10.768 --> 31:12.302
without him.

31:15.435 --> 31:16.369
He didn't do it.

31:17.203 --> 31:18.236
- How do you know that?
- This is a mistake.

31:18.302 --> 31:19.635
[Thomas] Hey, hey.

31:19.701 --> 31:20.635
Diana.

31:20.701 --> 31:21.701
- Di...
- [door creaks, opens]

31:26.536 --> 31:27.435
[sighs deeply]

31:28.502 --> 31:30.335
[Diana] Hey, where are you
going?

31:31.969 --> 31:33.302
Go back to your friend.

31:34.435 --> 31:35.669
No. I wanna help you.

31:36.537 --> 31:37.570
What do you suggest?

31:38.702 --> 31:39.702
I go to the police,

31:40.570 --> 31:41.602
or they'll help me...

31:42.055 --> 31:43.537
all the way to a lethal
injection?

31:45.503 --> 31:46.769
We need to gather evidence

31:46.836 --> 31:48.336
to prove your own case.

31:48.411 --> 31:50.470
If you're innocent,
you'll be able to prove it.

31:51.503 --> 31:52.503
And what if I'm not?

31:53.436 --> 31:54.370
Hm?

31:56.602 --> 31:58.637
Well, if you're not,
then lethal injection ain't enough.

31:58.970 --> 31:59.737
[John] Right.

32:01.603 --> 32:02.637
[Diana] Hey, I'm going with you!

32:02.703 --> 32:03.504
[John] No!

32:04.837 --> 32:07.471
So far, you've been a hostage.

32:07.970 --> 32:10.603
You take one more step,
you're an accomplice.

32:11.504 --> 32:12.437
Life without parole.

32:13.670 --> 32:15.437
Well, let's just hope I'm right
about you.

32:20.971 --> 32:23.404
[clanking]

32:25.504 --> 32:27.504
[ominous music]

32:33.571 --> 32:34.704
You know how to drive a truck?

32:34.771 --> 32:35.738
It can't be too hard.

32:38.571 --> 32:39.738
I think Diana should drive.

32:41.472 --> 32:42.405
All right.

32:43.438 --> 32:44.438
[keys jangling]

32:44.505 --> 32:45.405
[Diana] Thank you...

32:46.206 --> 32:47.438
for this and everything.

32:48.704 --> 32:49.738
Diana.

32:49.805 --> 32:51.438
You always said I should move
on.

32:51.972 --> 32:53.338
Let me.

32:57.438 --> 32:58.438
[sighs]

33:06.739 --> 33:07.672
[John] Hey.

33:08.705 --> 33:09.639
Thank you.

33:18.772 --> 33:20.439
She's too good for this.

33:20.705 --> 33:21.605
I know.

33:23.605 --> 33:24.539
I know.

33:29.706 --> 33:30.606
[groans]

33:31.207 --> 33:32.306
[sighs]

33:33.606 --> 33:35.407
All right, let's go.

33:36.673 --> 33:38.474

[car revs]

33:53.707 --> 33:56.507
[ominous music]

34:15.706 --> 34:17.408
So, where to first?

34:18.009 --> 34:19.375
Last crime scene.

34:19.429 --> 34:20.842
If I see it, it might trigger
something.

34:21.775 --> 34:22.708
Where is it?

34:23.507 --> 34:24.474
I don't remember.

34:25.708 --> 34:26.608
Right.

34:27.574 --> 34:28.475
Nice try.

34:30.507 --> 34:31.708
I don't know why I did that.

34:35.009 --> 34:36.608
Whoa. What do you need?

34:36.675 --> 34:38.675
Um, there should be a map in
there.

34:39.708 --> 34:40.608
Map?

34:44.507 --> 34:45.675
[John] Did I wake up in the
past?

34:47.675 --> 34:49.440
[Diana] Well, I'm sure
I can't use my phone.

34:49.507 --> 34:50.708
They're probably tracking it.

34:50.775 --> 34:51.676
[John] All right.

34:55.609 --> 34:56.509
Oh, god.

34:56.842 --> 34:57.709
What?

34:58.257 --> 34:59.543
Oh, my god. There's...

35:00.743 --> 35:04.543
[woman speaking indistinctly
over radio]

35:04.743 --> 35:05.576
What do we do?

35:05.643 --> 35:07.343
Well, we can't turn back now.

35:07.643 --> 35:08.676
[John] Just stay calm.

35:13.676 --> 35:14.709
[gun clicks]

35:34.011 --> 35:35.710
I don't think I breathed at all.

35:36.977 --> 35:38.544
[Diana] Thank god we took the
truck.

35:38.610 --> 35:40.311
They must be searching for my
car.

36:05.444 --> 36:06.411

36:07.745 --> 36:09.578
All right.
It should be around here somewhere.

36:10.745 --> 36:11.711
[John] Hey.

36:12.645 --> 36:13.645
Let me go alone.

36:14.511 --> 36:15.712

39:07.584 --> 39:08.484
[John] I knew her.

39:58.959 --> 40:00.586
Julia Govern lived in McNabb.

40:01.719 --> 40:02.653
[John] So?

40:02.842 --> 40:04.452
So it might be more useful
going there

40:04.530 --> 40:06.087
than just driving up
the next patch of trees.

40:06.153 --> 40:06.787
Right.

there.

41:27.622 --> 41:29.389
What if her mother recognizes
me?

41:30.690 --> 41:32.556
All right. Well, I'll just go
in.

41:32.757 --> 41:34.455

42:40.525 --> 42:41.458
in my stomach.

42:41.792 --> 42:42.525
I just...

42:43.490 --> 42:44.659
I think I need to lie down.

42:46.259 --> 42:48.792
- All right. Let's get you to a motel.

Oh, it's a nice place.
Not what I expected.

43:10.760 --> 43:12.326
It's right up the alley.

43:13.026 --> 43:14.526
Yeah, maybe she'll, uh,

43:14.726 --> 43:16.326
she'll sell it to you...

43:16.793 --> 43:18.393
to make her bail money.

43:19.993 --> 43:21.693
Pretty bad taste, though, buddy.

43:22.626 --> 43:23.861
[Roger] I mean, for all we know,

43:23.927 --> 43:26.426
this girl is lying in a field
somewhere, dead.

43:28.727 --> 43:30.426
I don't know. I'm just...

43:31.527 --> 43:32.960
[Frank] Of course, she's dead,
you know.

43:33.027 --> 43:34.727
Well, maybe she's in cahoots
with this guy.

43:35.627 --> 43:36.794
[Roger] That doesn't sound
right.

43:41.527 --> 43:42.561
Wait a minute.

43:43.627 --> 43:45.460
I think we might have something.

43:53.460 --> 43:54.360
Hmm.

Let's get an ID on this guy.

44:31.529 --> 44:32.596
[John] Okay.

44:34.062 --> 44:36.729
[Diana] I'll be right back.
Right after I check out Julia's.

okay?

48:13.037 --> 48:13.837
<i>Hello?</i>

48:16.703 --> 48:17.803
<i>What is your emergency?</i>

48:23.837 --> 48:25.404
[dog barking]

48:38.470 --> 48:39.504
[knocks on door]

48:46.637 --> 48:47.671
[Diana] Is your mother home?

48:47.737 --> 48:48.637
[Mia] Why?

48:49.074 --> 48:50.604
I was just hoping
I can get a word with her.

48:50.671 --> 48:51.804
You gonna ask about Julia?

48:52.637 --> 48:53.538
[Elizabeth] Mia!

48:53.919 --> 48:56.637
What have I told you about
opening the door for strangers?

48:57.471 --> 48:58.471
Mia, go to your room.

48:59.671 --> 49:01.604
[Diana] I'm sorry
to intrude like this. I...

49:01.872 --> 49:03.604
Who are you? What do you want?

49:03.671 --> 49:04.671
I'm a journalist.

49:05.327 --> 49:07.438
I don't talk to journalists
anymore.

49:07.620 --> 49:09.538
[Diana] Well, it's about
another young woman.

49:09.605 --> 49:10.572
- [Elizabeth] No.
- She's missing,

49:10.638 --> 49:12.471
and it's just like your
daughter.

49:16.738 --> 49:19.538
Any information you have
could save a life.

49:19.805 --> 49:22.738
I know that this is probably
really hard for you to talk about.

49:23.268 --> 49:24.235
[Elizabeth] You don't know.

49:25.440 --> 49:27.638
There's just heartbreak, and
hurt, and...

49:28.240 --> 49:29.705
and unanswered questions.

49:30.605 --> 49:31.973
There must be something that...

49:32.040 --> 49:33.372
[Elizabeth] No.

49:34.873 --> 49:35.739
I'd...

49:36.271 --> 49:37.806
I'd hoped that it would be
solved.

49:39.006 --> 49:42.639
But the world played another
cruel joke.

49:43.606 --> 49:44.806
What do you mean "cruel joke"?

49:46.806 --> 49:49.507
Everything you need to know
is in the cemetery.

49:50.606 --> 49:52.440
And all the good ones are there.

49:52.806 --> 49:55.739
If you're good, just stop
looking.

49:56.739 --> 50:00.506
You know, stop digging your own grave
or you'll all end up out there, too.

50:03.606 --> 50:04.707
[door creaks, slams]

50:21.640 --> 50:23.640

- [murmuring]

50:43.608 --> 50:45.541
[panting]

50:47.243 --> 50:48.474
[Roger] Criminal clear?

50:48.541 --> 50:49.442
Yes, sir.

50:56.708 --> 50:58.176
What happened here? Are you all
right?

50:58.243 --> 50:59.342
I'm fine.

50:59.541 --> 51:00.809
[pants]

51:02.243 --> 51:04.441
Can I get a minute alone with
my dad?

51:10.243 --> 51:11.343
What happened?

51:14.742 --> 51:15.742
He was here.

51:16.542 --> 51:17.442
[Roger] Who was here?

51:18.442 --> 51:19.642
<i>He</i> was here.

51:21.010 --> 51:21.776
The killer.

51:23.809 --> 51:24.742
What?

51:26.044 --> 51:27.376
Are you sure?

51:28.509 --> 51:29.542
[man speaking indistinctly on
radio]

51:31.044 --> 51:32.409
[sighs]

51:36.044 --> 51:37.543
[brakes squeaking]

51:39.743 --> 51:40.743

[locks clanking]

51:54.811 --> 51:55.743
[door opens]

51:57.510 --> 51:58.443
[John] Anything?

51:59.245 --> 51:59.878
No.

52:00.233 --> 52:01.476
- [John sighs]
- I don't know.

52:01.553 --> 52:04.544
[Diana] She said that I could find
all the answers in the cemetery.

52:05.511 --> 52:06.477
What does that mean?

52:07.578 --> 52:08.644
I wish I could tell you.

52:09.711 --> 52:10.644
[sighs]

52:11.011 --> 52:12.544
She's in distress, Diana.

52:12.778 --> 52:14.644
It's okay.
[sucks teeth]

52:16.246 --> 52:17.345
[John] It's okay.

52:18.778 --> 52:21.444
You're still in recovery.
You should really be in bed.

52:21.511 --> 52:22.611
I already got a nap.

52:23.611 --> 52:24.511
Go ahead.

52:25.578 --> 52:26.477
[Diana] All right.

52:27.544 --> 52:28.477
Thank you.

52:38.012 --> 52:39.378
Good night, Diana.

52:40.579 --> 52:41.612
Good night, John.

52:43.512 --> 52:44.545
[sighs]

52:55.645 --> 52:57.713
[brakes squeaking]

53:02.746 --> 53:04.746
[slow music playing on radio]

53:12.646 --> 53:13.646
Shot of beer.

[bottle clinks]

53:16.646 --> 53:18.413
[bottle pops]

53:20.048 --> 53:21.346
What's your name?

53:21.814 --> 53:23.379
[Audrey] Audrey.

53:25.248 --> 53:26.346
Audrey.

53:26.400 --> 53:28.861
I bet you could tell me how to
get to Ridgewood Brook Lane?

53:29.479 --> 53:31.447
Well, maybe.

53:34.248 --> 53:35.581
Just go out to the road.

53:35.848 --> 53:38.514
Take a left, then make a right.

53:38.714 --> 53:40.681
And at the stop sign, you'll
get to Brook.

53:41.048 --> 53:42.414
What time you'd get off?

53:43.014 --> 53:44.028
[Audrey] Two-thirty.

53:47.747 --> 53:48.747
I'll check back around.

54:01.615 --> 54:02.815
[dog barking]

54:05.849 --> 54:07.615
[engine rumbling in distance]

54:15.782 --> 54:17.615
[sighs]
Couldn't sleep?

54:22.548 --> 54:23.481
You?

54:23.683 --> 54:24.583
[John] A little.

54:30.749 --> 54:33.349
Look, I'm no nurse,
but I don't think those are good for you.

54:34.516 --> 54:36.482
Just bummed it off
over a friendly drunk girl.

54:36.549 --> 54:37.516
[both chuckle]

54:38.565 --> 54:40.683
[Diana] Guess I needed something
to take the edge off.

54:41.318 --> 54:43.252
I really wish we found
something today.

54:44.549 --> 54:45.549
Yeah.

54:48.516 --> 54:50.549
Diana, I want you to do
something for me.

54:52.482 --> 54:53.650
I want you to go home.

54:54.550 --> 54:56.617
To your job, your life.

54:57.617 --> 54:59.349
- I can't.
- [John] Why?

54:59.650 --> 55:01.350
It's gotta be better than this
shithole.

55:05.517 --> 55:08.650
When I was 15 years old, we found
out my daddy was having an affair.

55:09.750 --> 55:12.750
We had no idea until his mistress
turned up dead in her apartment.

55:13.717 --> 55:14.952
He was sentenced to life in
prison,

55:15.018 --> 55:17.417
and I swore to god
I'd never talk to him again.

55:18.751 --> 55:20.618
[Diana] Four years after that,
he hung himself.

55:22.651 --> 55:23.651
Two years later,

55:24.012 --> 55:26.685
new evidence emerged and they
caught the guy who actually did it.

55:26.770 --> 55:30.451
So he died thinking I wanted him
dead, and that's probably why.

55:32.018 --> 55:33.551
[John] What else could you have
done?

55:34.751 --> 55:36.418
I could have believed him.

55:38.296 --> 55:39.941
He said the same thing you did.

55:41.418 --> 55:42.618
"I didn't do it 'cause I
couldn't."

55:43.618 --> 55:44.942
That was his only defense.

55:47.551 --> 55:49.351
I won't let that happen to you.

55:55.053 --> 55:58.352
[clanking]

56:00.752 --> 56:01.686
[switch clicks]

[whirring]

56:13.485 --> 56:15.619
[foreboding music]

56:30.054 --> 56:31.653
You should go and let him know
we're here.

56:32.020 --> 56:33.553
I'll put this in the garage for
him.

56:33.854 --> 56:35.453
Don't touch anything.

56:35.653 --> 56:37.486
Tom's very particular about his
stuff.

56:37.753 --> 56:38.653
I noticed.

56:42.653 --> 56:44.520
[engine revs]

57:49.656 --> 57:50.590
Thomas?

57:51.723 --> 57:53.556
- [switch clicks]
- I'm sorry, Thomas.

57:56.257 --> 57:57.356
Thomas?

57:59.756 --> 58:00.723
Thomas?

58:01.023 --> 58:02.389
[John] Oh, shit!

58:08.690 --> 58:09.656
Fuck!

58:16.057 --> 58:17.423
[Diana] What did you do?

58:17.490 --> 58:18.389
Jesus!

58:19.757 --> 58:20.691
Diana, I didn't do this.

58:20.757 --> 58:21.757
You killed Tom?

58:21.958 --> 58:23.457
I couldn't kill Tom!

58:23.657 --> 58:24.691
[Diana] Don't say that to me.

58:24.757 --> 58:26.357
[John] Diana, listen to me.

58:26.436 --> 58:28.291
You knew what my dad said
and you used it against me.

58:28.357 --> 58:29.557
[John] No.

58:30.258 --> 58:31.457
No, Diana...

58:31.757 --> 58:32.757
Diana!

58:34.490 --> 58:35.457
[grunts]

58:37.024 --> 58:38.758

58:55.525 --> 58:56.692
Who are you?

59:46.497 --> 59:47.464
[Frank] Look what I found.

59:51.594 --> 59:52.493
[Roger] Shit.

59:52.562 --> 59:53.694
So you think that sweet, little
nurse...

59:54.285 --> 59:55.660
killed both her best friend

59:56.219 --> 59:57.286
and our John Doe?

59:57.740 --> 01:00:00.493
I tell you right now,
that son of a bitch is not our John Doe.

01:00:00.633 --> 01:00:02.096
[Frank] How could you be so
sure?

01:00:02.166 --> 01:00:03.836
[Roger] I got a good look at
his face.

01:00:04.047 --> 01:00:04.795
I know him.

01:00:05.627 --> 01:00:07.595
His name is Mark Rosovski.

01:00:09.628 --> 01:00:11.761
He was doing time over in
Yankton.

01:00:12.695 --> 01:00:14.628
He got parole about a month ago.

01:00:15.561 --> 01:00:16.695
What was he in for?

01:00:16.761 --> 01:00:18.461
Attempted murder for hire.

01:00:18.658 --> 01:00:22.561
Looks to me like we're not the
only ones trying to find this guy.

01:00:23.561 --> 01:00:26.494
This whole damn thing, it's starting
to spiral out of control, Frank.

01:00:26.828 --> 01:00:29.628
God only knows what we're
gonna end up with this.

01:00:31.628 --> 01:00:33.461
- [indistinct radio chatter]
- Fuckin' mess.

01:00:33.863 --> 01:00:35.729
[John] Fuck. Fuck.

local authorities immediately.</i>

- [Roger] <i>The assailant is supposed</i>

01:02:54.666 --> 01:02:55.466
<i>to be armed and dangerous.</i>

<i>Now, I'm asking you to please..</i>

01:02:57.208 --> 01:02:59.766
<i>Help us find this killer
before he claims another victim</i>

What's your emergency?

01:03:15.766 --> 01:03:18.467
I'd like to speak to Sheriff
Roger Bower.

01:03:19.700 --> 01:03:21.634
Uh, one moment, please.

01:03:21.834 --> 01:03:22.667
Who is it?

01:03:22.868 --> 01:03:23.734
Hello?

01:03:23.992 --> 01:03:26.834
I have information on the serial
killer y'all are looking for.

01:03:27.792 --> 01:03:28.759
Diana, is this you?

01:03:29.330 --> 01:03:30.501
[Frank] <i>Stay where you are.</i>

01:05:24.505 --> 01:05:25.472
[Diana] Hi.

01:05:25.905 --> 01:05:26.805
Hi.

01:05:28.272 --> 01:05:29.638
[Diana] Is Roger Bower home?

01:05:30.771 --> 01:05:32.405
Uh, no. You can find him at the
station.

01:05:32.472 --> 01:05:35.671
I was just hoping I could catch him
alone, away from all that.

01:05:37.301 --> 01:05:38.871
Well, do you wanna wait for him?

01:05:39.571 --> 01:05:40.638
Sure.

01:05:40.905 --> 01:05:42.472
I'd love to. Thank you.

01:05:42.671 --> 01:05:43.605
[Diana] I'm Diana.

01:05:44.273 --> 01:05:46.638
I'm Oliver. Roger's son.

01:05:47.671 --> 01:05:48.672
[Diana] Thanks.

[door closes]

01:05:51.845 --> 01:05:53.706
Oh, I'm sorry about the mess.
We're...

01:05:55.039 --> 01:05:56.206
We're redoing a lot.

01:05:56.273 --> 01:05:57.506
Oh, it's fine.

01:06:01.739 --> 01:06:02.506
Here.

01:06:02.572 --> 01:06:03.839
- Thank you.
- Sure.

01:07:24.709 --> 01:07:25.876
I hope I'm not intruding.

01:07:25.942 --> 01:07:27.675
[Oliver] Nah. It's nice to have
a visitor.

01:07:27.742 --> 01:07:29.575
I'm supposed to lay low anyway.

01:07:29.947 --> 01:07:30.680
Doctor's orders.

01:07:31.376 --> 01:07:32.742
I'd have to agree with him.

01:07:33.277 --> 01:07:34.675
But anyway, I'm a nurse.

01:07:35.575 --> 01:07:36.642
[stammering]
What happened?

01:07:37.077 --> 01:07:38.475
If I may ask.

01:07:39.609 --> 01:07:40.508
Home intruder.

01:07:41.077 --> 01:07:42.475
If you can believe it.

01:07:43.419 --> 01:07:45.643
Same guy who's on the run
for murdering all those women.

01:07:49.776 --> 01:07:51.776
Did you hear about it on the
news, or...

01:07:52.743 --> 01:07:53.676
[Diana] Yeah, I did.

01:07:54.290 --> 01:07:55.257
I know him, actually.

01:07:56.710 --> 01:07:59.576
I actually believed he was
innocent, so...

01:08:01.776 --> 01:08:02.743
Can I get you a drink?

01:08:02.979 --> 01:08:05.610
My dad makes this lemonade,
it's famous in McNabb.

01:08:05.676 --> 01:08:06.576
Sure.

Diana.

01:09:03.612 --> 01:09:04.511
It's me.

01:09:07.080 --> 01:09:08.511
Well, I'll be damned.

01:09:08.837 --> 01:09:10.779
[Michael] <i>My name is
Detective Michael Winslow.</i>

01:09:12.779 --> 01:09:14.411
If you need any more
information,

01:09:14.779 --> 01:09:15.813
ask Roger Bower.

[dial tone]

01:09:17.813 --> 01:09:19.446
You got a location on that call?

He used a burner phone, sir.

[cell phone clanks]

01:09:33.272 --> 01:09:34.138
Thank you.

That is nice.

01:09:40.479 --> 01:09:41.779
[Oliver] Secret family recipe.

01:09:44.714 --> 01:09:46.814
I have to say, you look a lot
like my mother.

01:09:47.580 --> 01:09:48.513
Really?

01:09:48.747 --> 01:09:49.747
Let me show you.

01:09:59.915 --> 01:10:01.580
Oh, she is beautiful.

01:10:02.344 --> 01:10:03.277
She, uh...

01:10:03.941 --> 01:10:06.480
<i>was</i> very beautiful.

01:10:07.781 --> 01:10:09.480
When she was alive.

01:10:09.681 --> 01:10:10.848
I'm sorry to hear that.

01:10:17.648 --> 01:10:18.581
[Frank] Roger.

01:10:20.581 --> 01:10:21.514
Roger!

01:10:23.915 --> 01:10:26.016
- Ro... Have you seen Sheriff?
- No, sir.

01:10:30.282 --> 01:10:32.548
- [Frank] Have you seen the sheriff?
- No.

01:10:40.816 --> 01:10:42.582
[cell phone ringing]

01:10:43.916 --> 01:10:45.216
Sheriff Bower here.

01:10:45.283 --> 01:10:46.382
Roger.

01:10:47.616 --> 01:10:49.816
I just got a really fucked up
phone call.

01:10:51.283 --> 01:10:52.382
What is it?

01:10:53.849 --> 01:10:55.582
Do you know a guy named Michael
Winslow?

01:10:57.649 --> 01:10:58.582

Get out of here. Leave me alone!

01:11:17.884 --> 01:11:19.516
I'm Michael Winslow, right?

01:11:19.854 --> 01:11:21.251
- [Oliver] What do you want from me?
- Right?

01:11:22.341 --> 01:11:23.450
Tell me!

01:11:23.516 --> 01:11:24.717

01:11:28.583 --> 01:11:29.450
Tell me.

01:11:30.051 --> 01:11:31.516
I'm trying to remember.

01:11:32.684 --> 01:11:33.784
What else do you remember?

01:11:34.142 --> 01:11:35.751
The hell you put me and my
father through?

01:11:37.918 --> 01:11:39.784
- What did I do?
- [Oliver] You were crazy.

01:11:40.284 --> 01:11:41.818
Saying and doing things you
didn't mean.

01:11:42.918 --> 01:11:44.751
You were like a brother to me,
and then...

01:11:45.684 --> 01:11:46.584
[Mike] And then what?

01:11:47.479 --> 01:11:49.423
You're obsessed with those
girls.

01:11:49.509 --> 01:11:51.384
[Oliver] 'Cause you couldn't let it
go, could you?

01:11:51.677 --> 01:11:53.390
No matter how many times we
told you to.

01:11:54.818 --> 01:11:56.819

01:12:16.518 --> 01:12:17.452
Oliver.

01:12:17.919 --> 01:12:19.652
So now you remember.

01:12:20.310 --> 01:12:20.909
[thwacks]

01:12:22.652 --> 01:12:23.752
[Oliver] Oh, Mikey.

01:12:24.345 --> 01:12:25.552
Mikey.

01:12:25.752 --> 01:12:27.418
[Michael retches]

01:12:28.385 --> 01:12:29.319
[Oliver] Mikey.

01:12:38.573 --> 01:12:40.475
- There he is.
- [Michael panting]

01:12:40.553 --> 01:12:41.786
[Oliver] Thought you'd never
wake up.

01:12:44.786 --> 01:12:45.753
[knife clinks]

01:12:46.786 --> 01:12:48.786
[exhales]
What did you do to her?

01:12:50.519 --> 01:12:52.486
She just passed out. Don't
worry.

01:12:53.287 --> 01:12:55.386
I saved the good stuff for you
to watch.

01:12:56.787 --> 01:12:58.787
You really like this one, huh?

01:12:58.854 --> 01:12:59.787
[Oliver] Me, too.

01:13:00.472 --> 01:13:02.520
I generally prefer blondes,
but...

01:13:02.921 --> 01:13:04.386
That's just my type.

01:13:06.287 --> 01:13:07.654
Does she look like your mama?

01:13:09.587 --> 01:13:10.821
[Mike] Like all your other
victims?

01:13:14.587 --> 01:13:16.487
You don't remember
what my mother looks like.

01:13:17.654 --> 01:13:18.554
[chuckles]

01:13:19.687 --> 01:13:20.687
My own best friend.

01:13:20.754 --> 01:13:22.454
I was never your friend.

01:13:22.520 --> 01:13:23.554
Wow!

01:13:24.855 --> 01:13:26.855
And I thought you were lying
about the amnesia.

01:13:28.788 --> 01:13:30.622
[Oliver] I guess the upside
to my mother being dead

01:13:30.688 --> 01:13:33.387
is that she'll always be young
and beautiful to me.

01:13:34.088 --> 01:13:35.788
Why do you feel the need
to kill young women?

01:13:37.255 --> 01:13:40.488
I felt awful when I hit
Linda Goreki with my car.

01:13:41.788 --> 01:13:43.455
But the funny thing is...

01:13:44.603 --> 01:13:47.688
all I could think about was what a
mother would say when she found out.

01:13:50.078 --> 01:13:50.978
So I called her,

01:13:51.991 --> 01:13:53.100
from Linda's phone.

01:13:53.956 --> 01:13:56.723
I was too scared to say
anything, so I...

01:13:56.789 --> 01:13:59.421
[inhales deeply]
...I just listened.

01:14:01.589 --> 01:14:03.522
It was nice to hear
a mother's voice again.

01:14:03.856 --> 01:14:05.489
You're sick, Oliver.

01:14:06.923 --> 01:14:08.656
You killed five young women.

01:14:14.589 --> 01:14:15.656
Right, well...

01:14:16.181 --> 01:14:16.980
almost six.

01:14:17.723 --> 01:14:19.623
See, I know I'm sick, John.

01:14:20.056 --> 01:14:21.623
That's just who I am now.

01:14:22.790 --> 01:14:23.857
I can't change it.

01:14:24.690 --> 01:14:25.757
I've tried to.

01:14:26.090 --> 01:14:27.690
And I can't, so...

01:14:30.149 --> 01:14:31.149
[Michael] Diana.

01:14:31.590 --> 01:14:32.523
It's okay.

01:14:33.790 --> 01:14:34.790
Shh.

01:14:36.007 --> 01:14:37.724
- Don't lie to her before she dies.
- [Diana groans]

[Diana whimpering]

01:15:15.893 --> 01:15:17.491
[gasps]
Stay back.

01:15:19.524 --> 01:15:20.458
Okay.

01:15:25.626 --> 01:15:27.592
- [Mike] I need you to dial 911.
- All right.

01:15:28.659 --> 01:15:29.826
- Dial.
- I got it.

01:15:30.339 --> 01:15:31.433
Then leave the house.

01:15:31.496 --> 01:15:33.182
Don't come back no matter what
you hear.

01:15:33.366 --> 01:15:34.665
Go.

01:15:35.066 --> 01:15:36.392

[somber music]

01:16:48.629 --> 01:16:49.795
You're a good detective.

01:16:51.895 --> 01:16:53.528
Damn good one.

01:16:54.795 --> 01:16:55.862
He was sick...

01:16:58.595 --> 01:17:00.428
after his mama died.

01:17:00.629 --> 01:17:01.795
Five girls, Roger.

01:17:04.928 --> 01:17:06.428
[Michael] Five.

01:17:08.296 --> 01:17:09.695

01:17:41.297 --> 01:17:42.663
I swear to god, Roger.

01:17:43.797 --> 01:17:45.496
I'm gonna find this bastard.

01:17:48.063 --> 01:17:49.731
[Roger] <i>You gotta know, it
killed me.</i>

01:17:50.631 --> 01:17:51.797
<i>When he was doing it.</i>

01:17:52.830 --> 01:17:54.697
<i>It tore me up inside.</i>

01:17:59.530 --> 01:18:02.731
I vowed that I would protect
that boy no matter what.

01:18:05.697 --> 01:18:08.798
I just had no idea how far
I would have to take it.

01:18:15.298 --> 01:18:16.798
[Roger] <i>I knew you were gonna
find him.</i>

01:18:17.765 --> 01:18:18.864
<i>My son.</i>

01:18:19.874 --> 01:18:23.187
<i>The only family I have left
was gonna be taken away from me</i>

01:18:24.064 --> 01:18:25.665
<i>It was either you or him.</i>

01:19:44.635 --> 01:19:45.568
Roger.

01:19:46.800 --> 01:19:48.601
I've located Annabelle Fargo.

01:19:48.668 --> 01:19:49.800
[Michael] In a trunk of a car.

01:19:50.282 --> 01:19:52.401
I'm calling you first
'cause you're my friend.

01:19:52.461 --> 01:19:53.767
But I've got to call it in.

01:19:53.834 --> 01:19:55.834
Look, Mike. No, please.

01:19:56.700 --> 01:19:57.800
Not yet.

01:19:58.270 --> 01:20:00.202
Look, I just got a call with
Oliver.

01:20:00.269 --> 01:20:02.668
He's gonna meet me over
at Lou's Ranch at the warehouse.

01:20:02.935 --> 01:20:04.835
I wanna be there when he's
arrested.

01:20:05.701 --> 01:20:09.534
Please, we'll take him in together.
I promise, please.

01:20:10.801 --> 01:20:11.768

01:20:21.102 --> 01:20:22.801
And I was a good dad.

01:20:26.701 --> 01:20:28.535
I tried to take care of it.

01:20:31.602 --> 01:20:35.236

What the fuck is wrong with you?

01:21:01.570 --> 01:21:02.603
Dad, please.

01:21:02.803 --> 01:21:03.803
I blacked out.

01:21:04.568 --> 01:21:07.403
I couldn't help myself.
I don't know what's wrong with me.

01:21:08.837 --> 01:21:09.870
[sighs]

Mikey saw me.

[Roger] <i>I felt like I
didn't have a choice.</i>

01:21:34.305 --> 01:21:36.871
<i>It was so damn hard for me,
Michael.</i>

01:21:38.838 --> 01:21:40.671
You were like a son to me.

01:21:42.071 --> 01:21:43.505
[sighs]

01:21:45.071 --> 01:21:46.604
But Oliver...

01:21:49.538 --> 01:21:50.771
he was my son.

01:21:52.671 --> 01:21:53.838
[Roger] <i>When you called me,</i>

01:21:54.604 --> 01:21:56.604
<i>I sent Rosovski instead.</i>

01:21:57.538 --> 01:21:58.839
<i>I told him where you were going</i>

01:21:59.627 --> 01:22:01.839
<i>And hired him to handle the
situation.</i>

01:22:03.672 --> 01:22:05.672

[Roger] <i>The son of a bitch
were sure that you were dead.</i>

01:22:24.838 --> 01:22:27.672
<i>He took your badge and ID
like I told him to.</i>

01:22:27.873 --> 01:22:28.873
<i>And that was that.</i>

01:22:29.817 --> 01:22:32.040
<i>But you must have some kind
of guardian angel</i>

01:22:32.107 --> 01:22:33.573

well...</i>

01:22:33.774 --> 01:22:35.041

01:22:35.119 --> 01:22:37.740
<i>When I heard that you were stil
out there, still kicking,</i>

01:22:38.277 --> 01:22:40.195
<i>I sent him to finish the job.</i>

01:22:40.438 --> 01:22:42.271
<i>I knew that if you were alive,</i>

01:22:42.584 --> 01:22:45.507
it was just a matter of time
before you caught him again.

01:22:48.706 --> 01:22:50.407
Who died in my house?

01:22:51.874 --> 01:22:53.539
How'd you fake my death?

01:22:54.874 --> 01:22:57.539
[sighs deeply]

01:22:57.606 --> 01:23:02.407
I took the body of some sorry
John Doe from the morgue.

01:23:03.574 --> 01:23:05.641
And then I planned the gas
explosion.

01:23:05.707 --> 01:23:06.674
[scoffs]

01:23:07.124 --> 01:23:09.707
Then I swapped his fingerprints
for yours.

01:23:10.707 --> 01:23:13.807
He became Michael Winslow, and
you...

01:23:19.540 --> 01:23:20.807
I thought it was a good thing.

01:23:23.775 --> 01:23:27.441
Maybe this whole thing could
finally end for my family.

01:23:28.574 --> 01:23:29.608
Making you...

01:23:30.309 --> 01:23:31.742
seem like a killer.

01:23:32.808 --> 01:23:35.377
And it wasn't a bad idea
somehow.

01:23:39.310 --> 01:23:41.442
And now my boy is dead.

01:23:44.708 --> 01:23:47.409
Oh, god, help me. I killed my
boy.

01:23:49.775 --> 01:23:51.541
And all I can think about...

01:23:52.809 --> 01:23:54.876
is that I should've done it a
lot sooner.

01:23:57.576 --> 01:23:58.609
[sniffles]

01:24:01.643 --> 01:24:03.410
You remember...
[sniffles]

01:24:03.676 --> 01:24:05.509
I taught you how to make this.

01:24:15.311 --> 01:24:16.809
Right before you tried to kill
me.

01:24:17.809 --> 01:24:19.609
It killed me, too, Mike.

01:24:20.542 --> 01:24:22.542
I want you to say my name,
Roger.

01:24:23.677 --> 01:24:24.710
The whole thing.

01:24:26.111 --> 01:24:27.577
So I can be sure.

01:24:28.677 --> 01:24:30.777
[Roger] Detective Michael
Winslow.

01:24:33.311 --> 01:24:34.411

soon.

01:24:39.610 --> 01:24:40.543
Yeah.

01:24:40.823 --> 01:24:42.744
You go on. You tell them
everything.

[police siren blaring]

01:24:45.610 --> 01:24:47.577
Don't worry, I'm not gonna go
anywhere.

01:24:50.610 --> 01:24:52.711
I got nowhere left to run to.

Get him up. Get him up. Get him
up!

- [handcuffs clicking]
- [Frank] I talked to Diana.

01:25:44.284 --> 01:25:45.217
Where's the body?

01:25:45.947 --> 01:25:46.847
In the basement.
