38:07.352 --> 38:10.520
Let's prepare
to greet our new friends.

38:10.522 --> 38:12.054
XO has the lead.

38:12.889 --> 38:14.790
Ow.

38:14.792 --> 38:16.224
Oh, that stings.

38:16.226 --> 38:18.694
Rachel: It's supposed to sting.
I'm cleaning it.

38:18.696 --> 38:19.762
I don't need it cleaned.

38:19.764 --> 38:20.996
Yes, you do.

38:20.998 --> 38:23.498
This is gonna sting a little.

38:23.500 --> 38:25.968
Ow.

38:25.970 --> 38:27.269
Chandler:
How you doing, Eng?

38:27.271 --> 38:28.570
All right, sir.

38:28.572 --> 38:30.104
Doc says I'll be on my feet
soon enough.

38:30.106 --> 38:34.176
No rush.
We got it all under control.

38:38.314 --> 38:39.614
She saved him.

38:43.719 --> 38:45.319
She's gonna save us all.

38:45.321 --> 38:46.754
Right,
Dr. Scott?

38:46.756 --> 38:50.124
Well, hopefully,
we'll save each other.

38:50.126 --> 38:52.259
Real soulful, this one.

38:52.261 --> 38:55.362
You never mind them good looks,
that brassy exterior.

38:55.364 --> 38:57.264
Word?

39:04.506 --> 39:07.408
I know--
Don't do it again.

39:07.410 --> 39:10.043
You don't have anything
to prove...

39:11.413 --> 39:14.582
if that's what it was about.

39:16.074 --> 39:18.488
And don't do it again.

39:22.623 --> 39:24.858
Tex:
Hey! Nursey!

39:24.860 --> 39:28.328
I need a cold compress here.

39:43.844 --> 39:46.512
Spoils of war.

40:17.943 --> 40:24.115
You know, I should be getting
this stuff ready for his family.

40:24.117 --> 40:28.253
But, uh...

40:31.089 --> 40:33.657
there's nobody even
to give it to.

40:36.761 --> 40:40.230
[ Crying ]

40:42.767 --> 40:45.702
Man:
Captain's on the bridge.

40:45.704 --> 40:47.536
They in sight?

40:47.538 --> 40:48.838
Yeah.

40:48.840 --> 40:52.574
I hear they serve Guinness
on board.

40:52.576 --> 40:57.046
Sir, E-Dub can't confirm
the signature on that vessel,

40:57.048 --> 41:00.049
but they don't think
it's British.

41:02.585 --> 41:04.687
Chandler:
It's the Russians.

41:04.689 --> 41:06.355
Set general quarters now!

41:06.357 --> 41:08.023
General quarters!
General quarters!

41:08.025 --> 41:09.891
<i>All hands,</i>
<i>man your battle stations!</i>

41:09.893 --> 41:12.828
[ Klaxon blaring ]
<i>Bridge, TAO--</i>

41:12.830 --> 41:15.631
<i>SCUNK Alpha just energized</i>
<i>fire control radar.</i>

41:15.633 --> 41:17.098
We're in their cross hairs.

41:17.100 --> 41:19.601
Man: [ Russian accent ]
Captain Tom Chandler?

41:19.603 --> 41:21.436
This is Commander Chandler.

41:21.438 --> 41:23.338
Identify yourself immediately.

41:23.340 --> 41:27.175
I am sorry to have made
such a rude introduction,

41:27.177 --> 41:31.980
but I believe you have something
that I want.
