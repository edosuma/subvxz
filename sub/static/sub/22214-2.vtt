15:40.857 --> 15:43.110
for murdering his wife,
Sharon Knowles.

15:43.317 --> 15:47.242
Initially, your husband, Tyrell
VVellick, was accused of the murder,

15:47.321 --> 15:48.618
until you claimed
Scott Knowles

15:48.698 --> 15:51.872
confessed to killing
his wife while beating you.

15:52.201 --> 15:54.454

from the night of the party

corroborate your story.

16:03.838 --> 16:05.966
My lawyers have advised
me not to speak to that.

16:06.549 --> 16:09.177
But what I can say,
Frank, is that

16:10.511 --> 16:13.355

to be arrested to know

16:13.890 --> 16:15.392
that my husband
isinnocent

Mr. Knowles is...

16:18.478 --> 16:19.980

16:31.073 --> 16:33.792
Some even went so far as to
claim you filed for divorce.

16:34.160 --> 16:37.084
I did file for divorce...
a few months ago.

16:37.830 --> 16:39.753
It was a moment
of weakness.

16:40.750 --> 16:43.094

that was the right thing to do.

26:23.332 --> 26:26.006

me to go fuck myself.

remembering everything so well?

26:36.345 --> 26:39.349

26:53.195 --> 26:55.698

Why not?

want to know that.

28:04.266 --> 28:06.769

to call what we did.

28:08.687 --> 28:10.405

I did all of this

was so that we
could be close again.

of rapid global inflation,

29:21.510 --> 29:25.356
19 of the 20 members
of this international forum

29:25.430 --> 29:28.934
have signed
the Five/Nine Economic Accord,

29:29.017 --> 29:31.440
making Ecoin the currency

29:31.520 --> 29:33.522
by which all others
will be measured.

29:34.189 --> 29:35.611
The only obstacle

29:35.691 --> 29:38.695
is the illegitimate
monetary imposter

29:38.777 --> 29:42.031
that China has
unofficially adopted...

29:44.157 --> 29:45.374
Bitcoin.

29:47.119 --> 29:50.293
China is weakening
our economic state

29:50.372 --> 29:51.874
by not signing this accord,

29:51.957 --> 29:55.006
and the fact that they
have embraced Bitcoin,

29:56.044 --> 29:59.298
shows their resistance
and emphatic rejection

29:59.589 --> 30:04.140
of our collective attempt
to rescue the global economy.

30:05.095 --> 30:07.644

30:26.283 --> 30:28.786
Truthfully, the only reason
I even agreed to meet

30:29.077 --> 30:30.750
was that this room happens
to be on my way out...

30:30.829 --> 30:34.049

sign the goddamn accord!

it's as good as yours,

30:42.591 --> 30:45.310
but this currency
war must end.

30:49.222 --> 30:53.523
The rest of the world needs
China to embrace Ecoin now.

30:54.311 --> 30:57.941
We're at risk of other
countries pulling out.

31:02.027 --> 31:04.121
Let me put this
as simply as I can,

31:05.197 --> 31:08.451
so that we never have to
belabor this point again.

31:08.533 --> 31:13.289
Your success will
always follow mine.

31:15.957 --> 31:17.959
I don't give a fuck
about your accord.

31:19.002 --> 31:22.632
Until I get my U.N. vote,
don't waste my time.

31:23.590 --> 31:25.137
Or maybe in 11 days,

31:25.217 --> 31:30.565

mind about your precious U.N. vote

a chance to talk to her,

why you like her.

32:10.220 --> 32:13.394

good companion.

32:13.890 --> 32:15.267

bullet into each of them,

if Price doesn't
come through.

43:55.800 --> 43:59.475
If the U.N. approves
ourannexafion of the Congo,

43:59.971 --> 44:02.144
we can finally
move our operation

44:02.223 --> 44:04.100
to the country's
Luwow mine.

44:04.183 --> 44:08.233
Why would you still
want to carry this out,

44:08.896 --> 44:11.820
given the
serious implications?

44:15.486 --> 44:20.083
It's time Phillip Price's
hand got slapped.

44:49.937 --> 44:51.564
(DOOR SHUTS)

45:00.156 --> 45:03.035
DiPIERRO: Last time I buy
from that coffee shop.

45:03.367 --> 45:04.994
They only take Ecoin.

45:05.077 --> 45:06.294
NORM: Gotta use Ecoin.

45:06.370 --> 45:08.464
With the exchange rate,
dollar's worth shit now.

45:14.045 --> 45:15.592
DiPIERRO: You get anything
from Elliot's computer?

45:15.755 --> 45:17.473
NORM: He hasn't
logged in all day.

45:17.590 --> 45:19.968
Last night he sent an
encrypted email with a link.

45:23.346 --> 45:26.190
Could be lucky, could be
sending it to Tyrell, right?

45:26.265 --> 45:27.983
Is this from
last night?

45:29.977 --> 45:31.320
Oh, also
I was able to get

45:31.395 --> 45:33.693
a clean audio recording
of his place.

45:33.773 --> 45:35.150
Seriously?
NORM: Yeah.

45:35.233 --> 45:38.203
He dropped some good intel.
Here, let me play it for you.

45:39.487 --> 45:41.285
(SONG PLAYING)
(LAUGHING)

45:43.658 --> 45:46.036
That'll be stuck in
my head all day now.

45:49.747 --> 45:50.999
(THUDDING)

45:51.165 --> 45:52.337
DiPIERROI Turn it Off.

45:52.500 --> 45:54.298
Is that coming
from downstairs?

45:55.836 --> 45:57.713
NORM: Yeah, that's
Darlene's apartment, but...

45:57.797 --> 45:59.140
who the fuck is that?

45:59.257 --> 46:01.680
Is Darlene home?
NORM: No, she's out.

46:02.510 --> 46:04.638
NORM: You think she told
someone about the safe house?

46:08.432 --> 46:11.026
DiPIERRO: This email he sent
from his computer,

46:11.102 --> 46:12.649
did you go to this link?

46:12.895 --> 46:15.193
NORM: Yeah, downloaded
the file, opened it,

46:15.273 --> 46:17.025
but didn't find anything.

46:18.859 --> 46:20.861
This email
isn't for Tyrell.

46:26.575 --> 46:27.952
It's for us.
