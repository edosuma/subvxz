00:08.520 --> 00:10.840
Frater J.P.? Got a special
delivery here from a M. Therion.

00:13.360 --> 00:16.030
<i>But can you imagine an army</i>

00:16.120 --> 00:19.120
<i>of true believers
hanging on your every word?</i>

00:19.200 --> 00:21.620
- I can.
- <i>This work was intended</i>

00:21.700 --> 00:24.670
for the one true
Magus of this lodge.

00:24.750 --> 00:27.420
Will that man
kindly step forward

00:27.500 --> 00:28.750
and claim his mantle?

00:28.840 --> 00:31.380
<i>You and Alfred's workings</i>

00:31.460 --> 00:33.470
- are the least of my problems.
- They weren't

00:33.550 --> 00:35.010
just workings, Jack.

00:36.890 --> 00:39.390
- Where's Susan?
- She went to go see Alfred.

00:39.470 --> 00:42.310
He turned himself in
so the others could go free.

00:42.390 --> 00:45.940
I accept full responsibility
as Magus.

00:46.020 --> 00:47.650
But you have another
responsibility now.

00:49.360 --> 00:50.480
<i>Are you...</i>

00:50.570 --> 00:51.980
- Aleister Crowley?
- Yes.

00:52.070 --> 00:53.820
How can I help you?

00:53.900 --> 00:54.990
He's in London.

00:55.070 --> 00:55.990
<i>There's no way you could have</i>

00:56.070 --> 00:57.160
<i>been meeting with him.</i>

00:57.240 --> 00:59.330
<i>He's been here the entire war.</i>

00:59.410 --> 01:01.040
This house, your company,

01:01.120 --> 01:02.500
all came into existence

01:02.580 --> 01:04.016
because you saw
what others couldn't.

01:04.040 --> 01:06.580
<i>Tell me what you want.</i>

01:08.250 --> 01:10.040
<i>I want it all.</i>

01:22.890 --> 01:25.230
<i>JPL site to
be spread over 20 acres</i>

01:25.310 --> 01:27.350
with four different
research sections...

01:29.400 --> 01:31.570
eight testing pits,

01:31.650 --> 01:32.690
a wind tunnel,

01:32.780 --> 01:33.980
<i>a supersonic lab,</i>

01:34.070 --> 01:35.610
<i>thermojet lab,</i>

01:35.690 --> 01:37.700
two hydraulic presses
and everything else

01:37.780 --> 01:39.700
we need to make us
completely self-sufficient.

01:39.780 --> 01:40.620
<i>It will be the most advanced</i>

01:40.700 --> 01:43.870
rocketry facility
the world has ever known.

01:43.950 --> 01:47.080
Filled with the world's
top minds.

01:51.420 --> 01:53.210
<i>I assume all these candidates</i>

01:53.300 --> 01:54.510
have the proper clearance.

01:54.590 --> 01:56.170
Uh-huh.

01:57.550 --> 01:59.390
<i>Well, I've seen enough.</i>

01:59.470 --> 02:01.890
I just hope the facility
lives up to its promise.

02:01.970 --> 02:04.010
How soon can you
start construction?

02:04.100 --> 02:05.560
Very soon.

02:05.640 --> 02:07.180
Sir, very soon.

02:08.440 --> 02:10.100
Is this a fucking joke?

02:10.190 --> 02:11.400
There wouldn't even be

02:11.480 --> 02:13.070
a JPL if it wasn't for him.

02:13.150 --> 02:15.070
We owe him a chance
to get better.

02:33.380 --> 02:35.130
You are a beast,

02:35.210 --> 02:38.420
and a beast knows no bounds.

02:49.140 --> 02:52.150
I'm yours.

03:01.450 --> 03:03.280
Guess this is it.

03:03.370 --> 03:05.490
- Yeah.
- I cannot believe you're leaving.

03:07.580 --> 03:09.290
The Magus has always
been my guiding light,

03:09.370 --> 03:11.120
so why would I stay?

03:11.210 --> 03:13.290
The faith goes beyond him.

03:13.380 --> 03:16.800
We have to reflect and rebuild.

03:16.880 --> 03:18.510
Don't mind her.

03:23.220 --> 03:26.640
Were up to me,
we'd be going, too.

03:28.680 --> 03:30.270
Love is the law.

03:30.350 --> 03:32.350
Love under will.

03:41.110 --> 03:43.110
Don't answer that.

03:43.200 --> 03:44.820
It's probably another reporter.

03:44.910 --> 03:46.950
Or Mildred calling to harass us.

03:47.030 --> 03:49.120
Sticks and stones, Mrs. Parsons.

03:49.200 --> 03:50.830
Well, that's easy
for you to say.

03:50.910 --> 03:53.120
You haven't been forced
from your home.

03:53.210 --> 03:55.000
Do you know what
my landlord called me?

03:55.080 --> 03:58.300
"A divorcée
of questionable morals."

03:58.380 --> 03:59.550
Can you believe it?

03:59.630 --> 04:02.340
We're surrounded by philistines.

04:02.420 --> 04:05.720
Yes. Precisely.

04:09.100 --> 04:11.180
You've reached
the fiery lake of sulfur.

04:11.270 --> 04:12.520
How may I direct your call?

04:12.600 --> 04:13.600
Patty?

04:13.640 --> 04:15.810
Please don't hang up.

04:15.900 --> 04:18.190
It's no one.
I'll handle it.

04:18.269 --> 04:20.779
What do you want, Daddy?

04:28.780 --> 04:32.870
Hasn't Alfred's appeal
already been submitted?

04:32.960 --> 04:36.540
I want... I want to make sure
we've done everything we can.

04:38.420 --> 04:40.420
Virgil called.

04:41.460 --> 04:42.880
Did you talk to him?

04:42.970 --> 04:44.880
He's worried for me.

04:44.970 --> 04:47.340
He thinks you and Jack are
going to lose the house.

04:47.430 --> 04:48.720
Why would he think that?

04:48.800 --> 04:50.390
Are you?

04:51.470 --> 04:53.890
Jack's had some trouble at work.

04:53.980 --> 04:56.060
He won't tell me about it.

04:57.100 --> 04:59.190
If we had to move,
where would we go?

04:59.270 --> 05:01.610
I don't know.

05:01.690 --> 05:03.900
Would you take me with you?

05:07.360 --> 05:10.080
Maybe I'll ask Jack
when I see him.

05:21.090 --> 05:22.760
Leave...

05:22.840 --> 05:24.210
me...

05:24.300 --> 05:25.470
alone!

05:25.550 --> 05:28.180
You're not fucking real!

05:30.850 --> 05:33.220
How do you know? Hmm?

05:35.230 --> 05:39.060
Just because I'm
not here in body

05:39.150 --> 05:42.110
doesn't mean I can't
be here in spirit.

05:42.190 --> 05:45.070
There are two explanations.

05:45.150 --> 05:47.910
Either you really are crazy,

05:47.990 --> 05:49.700
or...

05:50.700 --> 05:52.080
Or?

05:52.160 --> 05:55.410
You ever heard
of astral travel? Hmm?

05:55.500 --> 05:57.920
Yes, I know.
Sounds like hogwash,

05:58.000 --> 06:01.210
being in two places at one time.

06:01.290 --> 06:05.300
But I am the greatest magician
of the last 300 years.

06:05.380 --> 06:08.010
If anybody could do it...
Yeah? Hmm?

06:08.090 --> 06:09.760
You don't even look like this.

06:09.840 --> 06:11.970
- Richard said you...
- Richard.

06:12.050 --> 06:13.470
Your good friend Richard.

06:13.560 --> 06:15.390
Always seems to have your back

06:15.470 --> 06:18.190
except when he's sticking
a knife into it.

06:18.270 --> 06:20.600
You're about to lose everything,

06:20.690 --> 06:24.730
and right now
I may be the only ally you have.

07:35.100 --> 07:36.406
Of course
they fucking approved it.

07:36.430 --> 07:37.560
You're a salesman, Rich.

07:37.640 --> 07:39.350
You learned from the best.

07:39.430 --> 07:42.270
When did they say the first
round of funding comes in?

07:45.310 --> 07:47.360
Look, I know they're not
my biggest fans right now,

07:47.440 --> 07:49.860
but they'll come around.

07:49.940 --> 07:52.860
Did you talk to Braxton
and Wallace?

07:52.950 --> 07:54.030
Topic was broached.

07:54.110 --> 07:56.070
What you're cooking
smells divine.

07:56.160 --> 07:57.580
What's it called again?

07:57.660 --> 07:58.910
- Enchiladas.
- Enchiladas.

07:58.990 --> 08:01.870
Rich, what did they say?

08:07.340 --> 08:09.250
I got them to agree

08:09.340 --> 08:12.380
to consider letting you remain
a part of JPL.

08:14.470 --> 08:17.640
But there are conditions.

08:17.720 --> 08:20.770
You need to get
a psychiatric evaluation.

08:25.350 --> 08:27.770
<i>I told you so.</i>

08:27.860 --> 08:30.280
There isn't a choice.

08:30.360 --> 08:32.110
You need to regain
peoples' trust.

08:32.190 --> 08:34.320
- Including yours?
- I'm your friend.

08:34.400 --> 08:36.635
- I'm worried for you.
- You're the reason this happened.

08:36.659 --> 08:37.409
That's not fair. The truth

08:37.490 --> 08:38.676
would've come to light
eventually.

08:38.700 --> 08:39.909
It was a misunderstanding.

08:39.990 --> 08:41.080
It was a delusion.

08:45.080 --> 08:47.670
People need to know
that it was a momentary lapse

08:47.750 --> 08:50.420
and not something
that points to a deeper problem.

08:50.500 --> 08:51.500
It's the best I can do.

08:51.550 --> 08:54.300
Either you take the
evaluation or...

08:54.380 --> 08:56.260
Or what?

08:56.340 --> 08:59.510
You get cut out of the project
for good.

09:03.520 --> 09:04.850
Good evening.

09:04.940 --> 09:06.850
What's so fucking good about it?

09:06.940 --> 09:08.980
Jack!

09:10.230 --> 09:12.150
Can I help you?

09:12.230 --> 09:14.240
I have a telegram from
the United States Army.

09:36.550 --> 09:39.340
I'm afraid your request for
an appeal has been denied

09:39.430 --> 09:40.800
given your signed confession.

09:40.890 --> 09:42.850
It was made under duress.

09:42.930 --> 09:44.140
It doesn't matter.

09:44.220 --> 09:45.480
Now that you've pled guilty,

09:45.560 --> 09:47.230
you have to prove
your innocence.

09:47.310 --> 09:49.190
So, where does that leave us?

09:49.270 --> 09:51.690
Best we could hope for is
parole for good behavior.

09:51.770 --> 09:53.070
How long until that?

09:53.150 --> 09:54.910
Well, less than five years.
Ten, more likely,

09:54.940 --> 09:55.740
given the nature of your crimes.

09:55.820 --> 09:57.086
They'll want to make
an example out of you.

09:57.110 --> 09:59.700
This is a witch hunt.

09:59.780 --> 10:01.990
We should file another request.

10:02.080 --> 10:04.620
To the Supreme Court,
if need be.

10:06.460 --> 10:08.330
I'll give you two a moment

10:08.420 --> 10:10.330
to discuss how
you'd like to proceed.

10:18.130 --> 10:19.590
You're very quiet.

10:20.590 --> 10:23.350
Feels like you're giving up.

10:23.430 --> 10:25.970
I'm not.

10:26.060 --> 10:29.060
But we're running out
of resources.

10:31.310 --> 10:33.320
I love you.

10:36.320 --> 10:37.400
I love you, too.

10:37.490 --> 10:40.030
I don't know when I'll get
another chance to tell you.

10:40.110 --> 10:44.240
Five to ten years
is a long time.

10:44.330 --> 10:46.330
Lot can change.

10:47.620 --> 10:50.250
You'll still have a home
when you get out.

10:51.210 --> 10:53.040
And is that all I'll have?

11:02.510 --> 11:04.760
Guard.

11:04.850 --> 11:07.890
Mrs. Parsons and I...

11:09.310 --> 11:11.270
are done.

11:33.130 --> 11:35.090
How was Richard's?

11:37.250 --> 11:40.170
The military's given JPL
final approval.

11:40.260 --> 11:42.180
There's just one last hurdle.

11:42.260 --> 11:44.510
That's great.

11:44.590 --> 11:46.510
Sick again?

11:46.600 --> 11:48.640
Doesn't stop.

11:54.900 --> 11:57.230
Is there anything I can get you?

11:57.320 --> 11:58.900
Mm.

12:00.320 --> 12:01.990
Maybe some tea?

12:02.070 --> 12:03.490
Okay.

12:03.570 --> 12:05.120
Jack?

12:09.240 --> 12:11.160
I've been thinking.

12:11.250 --> 12:14.710
This baby...

12:14.790 --> 12:18.380
feels like a sign.

12:18.460 --> 12:20.840
Start of a new chapter.

12:20.920 --> 12:22.720
For us, I mean.

12:24.720 --> 12:27.800
Is this how you'd feel,
even if he wasn't in prison?

12:32.270 --> 12:34.640
You're my husband.

12:34.730 --> 12:36.940
I want us to be a family.

12:39.070 --> 12:40.730
Do you think we can do that?

12:47.070 --> 12:49.280
I think we can try.

13:00.340 --> 13:03.050
We're here today to evaluate

13:03.130 --> 13:05.010
the current state of
your mental condition.

13:05.090 --> 13:06.380
To start, I'm going to

13:06.470 --> 13:08.430
ask you a series of
true or false questions.

13:12.020 --> 13:16.230
I wish I could be as happy
as others seem to be.

13:16.310 --> 13:17.440
True.

13:17.520 --> 13:20.020
I have periods of restlessness

13:20.110 --> 13:22.860
when I cannot sit
long in a chair.

13:22.940 --> 13:25.360
False.

13:25.450 --> 13:28.200
I would describe
my childhood as happy.

13:29.780 --> 13:31.280
True.

13:31.370 --> 13:34.450
I have a good relationship
with my mother.

13:34.540 --> 13:35.580
True.

13:35.660 --> 13:40.210
I've never done anything
dangerous for the thrill of it.

13:43.170 --> 13:44.420
True.

13:47.300 --> 13:48.940
I would describe my marriage
as a success.

13:52.350 --> 13:53.770
True.

13:53.850 --> 13:56.850
Hmm. I would describe myself
as faithful

13:56.940 --> 13:58.400
to my spouse.

13:58.480 --> 13:59.650
True.

13:59.730 --> 14:02.650
I have trouble keeping secrets
from my spouse.

14:02.730 --> 14:04.280
I believe in you.

14:04.360 --> 14:06.860
True.

14:10.700 --> 14:13.450
Now, in court filings,

14:13.540 --> 14:16.450
your mother listed adultery
and mental instability

14:16.540 --> 14:19.580
as grounds for
divorcing your father.

14:19.670 --> 14:21.500
Where did you get
that information?

14:21.590 --> 14:23.630
Oh, these are public
records, Mr. Parsons.

14:23.710 --> 14:26.920
Family history is a part
of a thorough evaluation.

14:27.010 --> 14:31.640
Can you believe
this mollycot cunt?

14:33.390 --> 14:35.430
Something the matter?

14:36.680 --> 14:38.390
You betray me for these people,

14:38.480 --> 14:40.770
and now they question
your sanity.

14:40.850 --> 14:43.480
Did your father have trouble
separating fantasy

14:43.570 --> 14:44.860
from reality?

14:44.940 --> 14:46.820
I don't even know
why I'm still here,

14:46.900 --> 14:48.570
you gutless pile of shit.

14:48.650 --> 14:49.990
Leave me alone.

14:50.070 --> 14:51.320
Excuse me?

14:51.410 --> 14:53.660
Ooh, you've done it now.

14:53.740 --> 14:56.790
I just don't like
talking about my father.

14:56.870 --> 15:00.170
The only question you
really need to answer is

15:00.250 --> 15:04.790
do you wish to be
a madman or a Magus?

15:04.880 --> 15:06.590
Look,

15:06.670 --> 15:09.550
I know the difference
between what's real

15:09.630 --> 15:12.090
and what isn't.

15:20.940 --> 15:22.850
How'd it go?

15:22.940 --> 15:24.810
Um, it was fine.

15:24.900 --> 15:27.360
I answered all their questions
exactly as they wanted.

15:27.440 --> 15:28.780
I had an idea.

15:32.360 --> 15:34.870
What if we started renting out
rooms at the Parsonage?

15:34.950 --> 15:38.200
Sam and Angela are gone.
So is Joan.

15:38.290 --> 15:40.370
Instead of just giving away
their rooms again,

15:40.460 --> 15:42.830
we should make people pay for
the privilege of living there.

15:42.920 --> 15:45.710
That way, no matter
what happens here,

15:45.790 --> 15:48.050
we'll have a place to live.

15:48.130 --> 15:50.260
With plenty of room
for all of us.

15:53.340 --> 15:55.260
Patty, I'm gonna be a father.

15:55.350 --> 15:56.720
So what?

15:56.810 --> 15:58.680
So,

15:58.770 --> 16:01.230
what happened
between us can't happen again.

16:01.310 --> 16:04.400
I need to start
acting more responsibly.

16:09.440 --> 16:12.490
Nothing you have came
because you acted responsibly.

16:13.660 --> 16:15.740
Why start now?

16:22.330 --> 16:24.540
<i>Venga a nosotros Tu reino.</i>

16:24.620 --> 16:29.590
<i>Hágase Tu voluntad
en la tierra Como en El cielo.</i>

16:29.670 --> 16:31.760
<i>Danos hoy nuestro
pan de cada día.</i>

16:31.840 --> 16:34.430
<i>Perdona nuestras ofensas,</i>

16:34.510 --> 16:36.430
<i>Como también nosotros perdonamos</i>

16:36.510 --> 16:38.760
<i>a los Que nos ofenden.</i>

16:38.850 --> 16:44.890
<i>No nos dejes caer en tentación
y líbranos Del mal. Amén.</i>

16:44.980 --> 16:46.980
Amen.

16:50.690 --> 16:52.740
Wish Matias could see us
together.

16:53.860 --> 16:56.280
That's all he wanted.

17:08.170 --> 17:10.170
I'm so sorry for your loss.

17:12.710 --> 17:15.300
You can have it if you want it.

17:15.380 --> 17:16.839
Sir?

17:17.890 --> 17:20.140
My blessing.

17:20.220 --> 17:22.810
I don't need it anymore.

17:25.440 --> 17:27.349
It's not that I
don't appreciate it.

17:27.440 --> 17:30.150
It's just that Marisol
and I have decided

17:30.230 --> 17:32.280
we don't need to get married.

17:33.230 --> 17:35.280
Is that right?

17:37.570 --> 17:39.700
Well...

17:39.780 --> 17:42.660
I just hope you can
hold onto her.

17:42.740 --> 17:44.500
Lord knows, we couldn't.

17:44.580 --> 17:46.620
<i>Papá...</i>

17:54.800 --> 17:57.510
Do what thou wilt
shall be the whole of the law.

17:57.590 --> 17:59.300
What is thy will?

17:59.390 --> 18:01.550
It is my will
to eat and to drink.

18:01.640 --> 18:03.180
To what end?

18:03.260 --> 18:05.810
That I may fortify my body
and serve the Great Work.

18:05.890 --> 18:07.350
Love is the law.

18:07.440 --> 18:09.520
Love under will.

18:09.600 --> 18:11.360
Love under will.

18:11.440 --> 18:12.900
When in Rome...

18:14.940 --> 18:16.950
Sorry I'm late.

18:17.950 --> 18:19.860
What are you wearing?

18:19.950 --> 18:21.700
With the baby coming,

18:21.780 --> 18:24.080
I figured you wouldn't fit
in it much longer.

18:25.120 --> 18:26.580
Why didn't you just ask?

18:26.660 --> 18:29.170
I didn't realize I
needed your permission.

18:29.250 --> 18:32.380
I thought we shared
everything in this house.

18:40.300 --> 18:42.550
I'm sorry. I'm not feeling well.

18:59.150 --> 19:01.320
Did something happen
between the two of you?

19:05.160 --> 19:07.290
Oh, my God.

19:09.500 --> 19:11.170
Susan...

19:11.250 --> 19:12.880
Oh, get away from me.

19:17.510 --> 19:19.550
How could you?

19:22.140 --> 19:24.140
This is what we signed up for.

19:26.350 --> 19:29.100
Love is the law.
Do what we will.

19:30.850 --> 19:33.150
But not with her.

19:34.690 --> 19:36.730
Anyone else but her.

19:39.690 --> 19:42.070
<i>You should ask yourself,</i>

19:42.160 --> 19:44.950
<i>who do you truly serve?</i>

19:45.030 --> 19:47.830
I am unique and a conqueror.

19:47.910 --> 19:51.120
I am not
of the slaves that perish.

19:51.210 --> 19:54.710
I am unique and a conqueror.

19:54.790 --> 19:56.750
I am not of the slaves...

19:57.880 --> 19:59.630
You need to leave.

19:59.710 --> 20:01.760
I was just pursuing my will.

20:01.840 --> 20:03.720
Your will?

20:03.800 --> 20:05.640
To sleep with my husband?

20:05.720 --> 20:08.100
Doesn't Crowley encourage us
to live without labels?

20:08.180 --> 20:09.640
They're not just labels.

20:09.720 --> 20:12.310
We're family. We share
the same blood.

20:12.390 --> 20:14.400
Now we share
something else, too.

20:16.400 --> 20:18.320
God, what did he do to you?

20:18.400 --> 20:20.150
Virgil broke you,

20:20.230 --> 20:21.990
and now you've broken us.

20:22.070 --> 20:23.660
You're with another man's child.

20:23.740 --> 20:25.950
There wasn't much left to break.

20:33.290 --> 20:35.500
The man you really love
is in prison.

20:37.380 --> 20:40.460
And I have an idea
for how we can get him out.

20:42.630 --> 20:45.840
Maybe it's time
to reconcile with Daddy.

20:56.980 --> 20:59.150
They are
fighting to regain lost ground,

20:59.230 --> 21:01.030
while the Germans fend them off,

21:01.110 --> 21:03.490
trying to repair
their damaged borders...

21:03.570 --> 21:05.200
I want to be listening

21:05.280 --> 21:07.370
the moment those bastards
are defeated.

21:13.080 --> 21:15.580
If it's bothering you,
I can listen upstairs.

21:15.670 --> 21:19.250
No. No. I'm sorry.

21:19.340 --> 21:22.630
I was thinking about Jack.

21:22.710 --> 21:26.260
He hears the results of
his evaluation tomorrow.

21:28.180 --> 21:31.100
I have no idea how
he's gonna react.

21:31.180 --> 21:35.640
Feels like everything is on
such shaky ground these days.

21:36.940 --> 21:39.360
It's the war.

21:39.440 --> 21:41.520
The whole world has gone crazy.

21:45.190 --> 21:47.410
Can I ask you something?

21:47.490 --> 21:49.410
Mm-hmm.

21:49.490 --> 21:51.740
When we were with your father,

21:51.830 --> 21:54.750
and he gave me his blessing...

21:54.830 --> 21:57.290
maybe it was just
my imagination,

21:57.370 --> 22:01.210
and I-I don't mean
to beat a dead horse...

22:01.290 --> 22:04.090
It wasn't just your imagination.

22:06.840 --> 22:09.760
I guess I never
understood before,

22:09.840 --> 22:13.060
but I'm starting to get it.

22:14.060 --> 22:15.890
Get what?

22:15.980 --> 22:18.060
Just be nice to know

22:18.140 --> 22:21.360
that someone's gonna be there
for you, no matter what.

22:29.240 --> 22:30.910
Come in.

22:36.040 --> 22:38.920
I can't tell you how
good it is to see you.

22:40.880 --> 22:42.420
You can thank Patty for that.

22:42.500 --> 22:43.800
She insisted on it.

22:43.880 --> 22:46.590
She's in the library.

22:46.670 --> 22:48.800
But she wanted to talk
to Virgil alone.

22:50.180 --> 22:52.180
It's okay, Mabel.

22:53.720 --> 22:56.100
Here, let me show you
the garden.

23:00.060 --> 23:02.060
Patty?

23:05.900 --> 23:07.280
You look well.

23:07.360 --> 23:09.110
You don't.

23:09.200 --> 23:11.320
Well, it's been
a hard few years.

23:11.410 --> 23:12.490
Why?

23:12.570 --> 23:14.280
You won.

23:14.370 --> 23:16.580
These are overrun
with horn worms.

23:16.660 --> 23:18.370
If someone doesn't deal
with them,

23:18.450 --> 23:20.460
they'll kill the whole plant.

23:24.920 --> 23:26.840
How do you do it?

23:26.920 --> 23:29.090
Go on pretending.

23:31.130 --> 23:33.550
You couldn't
possibly understand.

23:37.600 --> 23:39.680
I've lost both my children.

23:41.390 --> 23:44.480
Maybe someday you'll know
what it is to be a mother.

23:44.560 --> 23:46.520
<i>The Magus is in prison.</i>

23:46.610 --> 23:48.400
Jack's career hangs
in the balance.

23:48.480 --> 23:50.570
There must be
some satisfaction in that.

23:50.650 --> 23:53.320
Uh, everything I have
done was to save you.

23:53.410 --> 23:54.990
From what?

23:55.070 --> 23:57.030
- These heathens?
- No.

23:57.120 --> 23:58.540
From yourself.

23:58.620 --> 24:00.660
I didn't need to be saved,
Daddy.

24:03.120 --> 24:04.880
Susan said on the phone

24:04.960 --> 24:07.040
that you were considering
coming home.

24:07.130 --> 24:09.880
Truth is, it stopped being fun
around here.

24:09.960 --> 24:12.880
Maybe there <i>is</i> such a thing
as too much freedom.

24:14.800 --> 24:16.550
But there's something
you'll need to do

24:16.640 --> 24:20.060
before I'll ever
step foot in that house.

24:20.140 --> 24:23.440
Swear you'll never
touch me again.

25:04.810 --> 25:06.560
It might bring you
some relief to know

25:06.650 --> 25:10.110
that Dr. Grisby found you
of fundamentally sound mind.

25:10.190 --> 25:11.900
He believes

25:11.980 --> 25:15.280
that the delusion you suffered
was a result of...

25:15.360 --> 25:18.910
Exhaustion psychosis.

25:18.990 --> 25:20.280
You've been working too hard.

25:20.370 --> 25:22.450
Exacerbated

25:22.540 --> 25:25.670
by excessive narcotic
and alcohol consumption.

25:25.750 --> 25:27.710
Which comes as no surprise
to all of us here.

25:27.790 --> 25:29.750
The general

25:29.840 --> 25:32.300
and I appreciate
all you've done,

25:32.380 --> 25:36.130
and recognize that the next
phase in the rocketry program

25:36.220 --> 25:39.510
was due in large part
to your efforts.

25:39.600 --> 25:41.310
For that reason,

25:41.390 --> 25:43.310
they have insisted that you
be offered some sort

25:43.390 --> 25:46.640
of ongoing role,
against my recommendation...

25:46.730 --> 25:49.520
Well, why didn't
you just say so?

25:49.610 --> 25:51.190
As a fuel technician.

25:54.110 --> 25:55.360
We could not

25:55.440 --> 25:56.650
in good conscience

25:56.740 --> 25:59.700
put you in any position
of authority.

26:00.910 --> 26:03.700
Then who's gonna run JPL?

26:03.790 --> 26:05.330
Mr. Onsted.

26:05.410 --> 26:07.580
Who else?

26:11.460 --> 26:13.380
You'd still be
inside the operation.

26:13.460 --> 26:15.050
Of course you'd be happy.

26:15.130 --> 26:16.896
- They crowned you king.
- You can't seriously expect

26:16.920 --> 26:18.906
to be put into a position
where you could jeopardize

26:18.930 --> 26:20.550
- the project again.
- Where's Patty?

26:20.640 --> 26:23.350
- She went home, Mr. Parsons.
- What does she have to do with this?

26:23.430 --> 26:25.850
- I need someone who's on my side.
- I'm on your side.

26:25.930 --> 26:27.156
He's been trying to push you out

26:27.180 --> 26:28.390
from the start.

26:28.480 --> 26:29.650
I told you,

26:29.730 --> 26:30.860
this was a mistake.

26:30.940 --> 26:32.060
You're damn right.

26:32.150 --> 26:34.190
I built this
entire scientific field.

26:34.280 --> 26:37.190
- Mr. Parsons, please.
- I don't need to be part of JPL.

26:37.280 --> 26:38.570
Last I checked,

26:38.650 --> 26:39.966
I'm still president
of this company,

26:39.990 --> 26:41.490
and we don't need them.

26:41.570 --> 26:43.990
This was a devil's bargain.

26:44.080 --> 26:46.040
We need to turn our focus
back to the stars

26:46.120 --> 26:48.040
instead of building
their weapons of war.

26:48.120 --> 26:50.080
You were a goddamn janitor
when we met.

26:50.170 --> 26:52.380
You're gonna spit in my eye
and expect me not to blink?

26:52.460 --> 26:53.920
I'm not gonna be lectured to
by a man

26:54.000 --> 26:56.050
who molested by mother
at a fucking dinner party.

26:56.130 --> 26:57.720
Jack.

26:57.800 --> 26:59.510
Believe me, Richard,

26:59.590 --> 27:01.156
it's only a matter of time
until these hypocrites

27:01.180 --> 27:03.390
do the exact same thing to you.

27:09.100 --> 27:11.850
How much, Jack?

27:13.310 --> 27:15.360
How much do you want
for your share of the company?

27:15.440 --> 27:18.400
I have done all I can to protect
you for as long as I can,

27:18.490 --> 27:20.320
but you just don't know
how to quit.

27:20.400 --> 27:21.910
Listen to your friend.

27:21.990 --> 27:24.910
Because we won't do business
with you at the helm.

27:24.990 --> 27:26.410
We'll pull all the orders.

27:26.490 --> 27:28.090
And you'll be left
in charge of a company

27:28.160 --> 27:30.290
with no future and no value.

27:37.170 --> 27:38.920
Ladies and gentlemen,

27:39.010 --> 27:41.090
the new aeon is upon us.

27:41.180 --> 27:44.300
And it is necessary
that we defend freedom,

27:44.390 --> 27:47.010
unless we all wish to be slaves.

27:57.360 --> 27:59.610
Thank you.

27:59.690 --> 28:02.570
Uh, I appreciate
the diligence, Detective,

28:02.660 --> 28:04.280
but the situation's
been resolved.

28:04.370 --> 28:05.846
My daughter and I
have begun to make amends.

28:05.870 --> 28:08.080
Well, that's exactly why
I wanted to call you in.

28:08.160 --> 28:10.410
Is something the matter?
Did something happen to her?

28:10.500 --> 28:12.750
Well, we received
an anonymous package.

28:12.830 --> 28:15.670
Weren't quite sure what
to make of it, but, um...

28:15.750 --> 28:18.590
some new evidence
has come to light.

28:18.670 --> 28:20.510
Well, did you finally get
something on Parsons?

28:23.050 --> 28:25.590
But there's
something you'll need to do

28:25.680 --> 28:29.350
before I'll ever step foot
in that house.

28:29.430 --> 28:30.536
Swear you'll
never touch me again.

28:30.560 --> 28:32.480
I've spent countless nights,

28:32.560 --> 28:34.940
uh, begging
the Lord's forgiveness.

28:35.020 --> 28:36.480
If you want me
to come back home,

28:36.560 --> 28:38.860
you'll have to beg
for my forgiveness.

28:38.940 --> 28:40.440
I'm sorry.

28:40.530 --> 28:41.530
That's not good enough.

28:41.610 --> 28:42.820
Get on your hands and knees.

28:42.900 --> 28:44.360
- What is this?
- Do it,

28:44.450 --> 28:47.160
or I'll never see or talk
to you again, so help me God.

28:47.240 --> 28:48.620
I am sorry.

28:48.700 --> 28:50.450
For all my trespasses.

28:50.540 --> 28:53.040
I want you
to name them and repent.

28:53.120 --> 28:55.210
I confess to having

28:55.290 --> 28:57.670
- lustful thoughts.
- About?

28:57.750 --> 28:59.500
Why are you making me do this?

28:59.590 --> 29:01.880
- I need to hear you say it.
- Just stop it. That's...

29:01.960 --> 29:03.170
Not just yet.

29:03.260 --> 29:04.630
- About you.
- Uh...

29:04.720 --> 29:06.510
I confess to touching you

29:06.590 --> 29:09.140
inappropriately
in a moment of weakness.

29:09.220 --> 29:12.020
It was more than once.

29:12.100 --> 29:13.536
Well, I've seen
the error of my ways.

29:13.560 --> 29:15.480
I swear, Patty. Come home.

29:15.560 --> 29:17.650
It won't ever happen again.

29:21.070 --> 29:24.450
What, you think this is
some kind of proof against me?

29:25.950 --> 29:29.030
Well... she-she
tricked me into saying it.

29:29.120 --> 29:30.870
It was a trap.

29:30.950 --> 29:33.000
They're all delusional.

29:33.080 --> 29:35.790
Uh, uh, Mabel,
just tell him it's all lies.

29:37.040 --> 29:40.460
It was happening
under your own roof.

29:40.540 --> 29:42.250
Surely, you must have known.

29:42.340 --> 29:44.760
She didn't, because
it didn't happen.

29:44.840 --> 29:48.510
All this time, you've been
crusading against these people.

29:51.470 --> 29:52.770
D.A. Yates

29:52.850 --> 29:54.560
is gonna hear
about this harassment.

29:54.640 --> 29:55.640
Let's go, Mabel.

29:55.730 --> 29:58.350
Come on, dear. Come on.

30:07.280 --> 30:09.280
No.

30:13.330 --> 30:15.620
I knew, but...

30:15.700 --> 30:18.540
I didn't want to believe it.

30:19.710 --> 30:23.250
Mrs. Byrne, I'm gonna need
a sworn statement.

30:29.340 --> 30:31.390
Mrs. Byrne, please come with me.

30:33.810 --> 30:37.730
Mr. Byrne, you're under arrest
for the rape of your daughter.

30:39.400 --> 30:42.150
Thank you all for being
a part of JPL's first test launch.

30:42.230 --> 30:43.770
Initiating countdown.

30:43.860 --> 30:45.150
Ad astra...

30:45.230 --> 30:46.610
Per aspera.

30:46.690 --> 30:48.320
Pump is engaged, Dr. Onsted.

30:48.400 --> 30:49.990
Seconds away. Over.

30:50.070 --> 30:52.950
And five, four,

30:53.030 --> 30:56.580
three, two, one.

30:56.660 --> 30:58.620
Liftoff!

30:58.710 --> 31:00.870
We're tracking now.

31:07.800 --> 31:09.800
Ha-ha! It left the atmosphere!

31:29.820 --> 31:31.740
D.A. Yates.

31:31.820 --> 31:33.370
Sorry, I don't have
time for this.

31:33.450 --> 31:34.830
I suggest you make it.

31:34.910 --> 31:36.830
It's about my stepfather,
Virgil Byrne.

31:36.910 --> 31:39.290
Have you seen
this morning's paper?

31:40.580 --> 31:42.830
I filed those
charges personally.

31:42.920 --> 31:44.670
They did leave
a key detail out...

31:44.750 --> 31:46.050
that Virgil Byrne was one

31:46.130 --> 31:48.130
of your biggest
campaign contributors.

31:48.210 --> 31:50.736
And, in exchange, you used the power
of your office to do his bidding.

31:50.760 --> 31:52.340
You have no proof of that.

31:52.430 --> 31:54.680
This isn't a court of law.
This is the press.

31:54.760 --> 31:57.180
I-I would think
even the merest suggestion

31:57.260 --> 32:00.060
of a link between you
and a child rapist would sink

32:00.140 --> 32:02.520
any ambitions you had
for higher office.

32:02.600 --> 32:03.850
Are you threatening me?

32:03.940 --> 32:05.860
Think of it as quid pro quo.

32:05.940 --> 32:07.190
You have something I want.

32:07.270 --> 32:10.190
Give it to me,
and the story ends here.

32:23.920 --> 32:27.840
"Rooms for rent at 1003
Orange Grove Avenue.

32:27.920 --> 32:31.170
"Only bohemians,
artists, musicians...

32:31.260 --> 32:33.380
"and anarchists need apply.

32:33.470 --> 32:35.640
"Freethinking and
the ability to pay rent

32:35.720 --> 32:36.890
"are the only requirements.

32:36.970 --> 32:39.600
Otherwise, do
what thou wilt."

32:39.680 --> 32:40.850
What do you think?

32:40.930 --> 32:42.560
Mother.

32:42.640 --> 32:43.850
Please.

32:43.940 --> 32:44.770
Come on.

32:44.850 --> 32:47.060
Ruth was helping me
proofread a classified.

32:47.150 --> 32:48.570
With everything that's happened,

32:48.650 --> 32:49.876
it's time to get rid
of the freeloaders.

32:49.900 --> 32:52.400
I hope that doesn't include me.

32:52.490 --> 32:53.796
Once the carriage house
is rebuilt,

32:53.820 --> 32:55.570
I'm sure you can move in there.

32:55.660 --> 32:57.740
My sister is going
to need a lot of help

32:57.830 --> 33:00.490
when your grandchild arrives.

33:00.580 --> 33:03.250
She's a clever girl, this one.

33:03.330 --> 33:05.580
Yes, she is.

33:05.670 --> 33:08.040
Is anybody here?

33:10.000 --> 33:12.340
Magus.

33:13.510 --> 33:16.220
What the fuck is he doing here?

33:19.890 --> 33:23.930
After a long time
in the wilderness,

33:24.020 --> 33:26.270
I have returned.

33:26.350 --> 33:27.350
To continue

33:27.440 --> 33:29.940
the Great Work.

33:30.020 --> 33:32.070
I know

33:32.150 --> 33:35.610
I must regain everyone's trust.

33:35.700 --> 33:38.410
How the hell'd you get out?

33:38.490 --> 33:41.580
She is a miracle worker.

33:41.660 --> 33:43.620
Wasn't just me.

33:43.700 --> 33:45.080
Patty helped.

33:45.160 --> 33:48.630
We need to celebrate

33:48.710 --> 33:52.250
the Agape once again rising
from the ashes.

33:54.720 --> 33:57.470
And celebrate

33:57.550 --> 33:59.430
the new life

33:59.510 --> 34:02.220
soon to be among us.

34:04.560 --> 34:06.810
Love is the law.

34:06.890 --> 34:08.940
Love under will.

34:10.230 --> 34:12.070
<i>I was willing to forget.</i>

34:13.730 --> 34:15.940
To be its father.

34:18.070 --> 34:19.989
It can still have
your last name.

34:20.070 --> 34:21.780
But that's all it'll have.

34:24.120 --> 34:26.409
I'm freeing you
of your obligation.

35:39.650 --> 35:41.660
This is your house.

35:42.990 --> 35:44.910
I know.

35:44.990 --> 35:47.080
Then maybe it's time.

35:47.160 --> 35:50.040
To take what's yours.

36:09.140 --> 36:12.600
I... have been waiting
for your call.

36:12.690 --> 36:15.770
I have received your offering.

36:15.860 --> 36:18.110
It required a sacrifice.

36:18.190 --> 36:20.440
A rather large one.

36:20.530 --> 36:22.320
It always does.

36:22.400 --> 36:24.360
But now you are free

36:24.450 --> 36:27.330
to pursue your own true path.

36:28.370 --> 36:31.620
Just answer one question.

36:31.710 --> 36:34.080
Is it really you
that I've been seeing?

36:35.670 --> 36:37.960
Science would say
it is impossible.

36:38.050 --> 36:39.630
What do you say?

36:39.710 --> 36:43.180
I say you
must only ask yourself,

36:43.260 --> 36:46.760
do you wish to be
a madman or a Magus?

38:30.490 --> 38:32.280
<i>Lee sobre esto aquí!</i>

38:32.370 --> 38:35.370
<i>Los Nazis Se rinden
a las fuerzas aliadas!</i>

38:35.450 --> 38:37.370
<i>Lee sobre esto aquí!</i>

38:57.850 --> 39:00.730
She's going to be here, right?

39:00.810 --> 39:02.940
She's always been like the wind:

39:03.020 --> 39:05.150
goes one way, then the other.

39:06.400 --> 39:08.950
But don't lose faith.

39:12.820 --> 39:14.620
Thought your family
wasn't coming.

39:14.700 --> 39:16.910
I did, too.

39:18.830 --> 39:20.960
You look nice.

39:21.040 --> 39:23.340
- A bit overdressed.
- What are you doing here?

39:23.420 --> 39:26.300
- You said...
- "Over my dead body." I know.

39:26.380 --> 39:28.736
- I couldn't let you go through with this...
- You're gonna try and stop me?

39:28.760 --> 39:30.090
Let me finish.

39:30.180 --> 39:31.970
I couldn't let you
go through with this

39:32.050 --> 39:33.760
and not be here to see it.

39:34.760 --> 39:36.390
What about Dad?

39:38.680 --> 39:40.600
Yeah, it's just as well.

39:40.690 --> 39:42.536
These people have been
kind enough to accept me.

39:42.560 --> 39:44.400
It's more than I can say
for the two of you.

39:45.650 --> 39:48.320
I'm here, aren't I?

39:48.400 --> 39:50.450
That's not all.

39:51.450 --> 39:52.990
I brought...

39:53.070 --> 39:55.740
your grandmother's ring.

39:56.990 --> 39:58.580
Figured you might
as well have it,

39:58.660 --> 40:01.210
since you seem intent on
going through with this.

40:04.130 --> 40:05.420
Assuming she shows up.

40:05.500 --> 40:06.880
I hear these people
are unreliable.

40:06.960 --> 40:09.300
Okay, you are something else.
Please just sit down.

40:28.610 --> 40:30.860
<i>Then the priest replied</i>

40:30.940 --> 40:34.200
and said
unto the Queen of Space,

40:34.280 --> 40:37.080
<i>kissing her lovely brows,
and the dew</i>

40:37.160 --> 40:41.500
of her light
bathing his whole body

40:41.580 --> 40:44.420
<i>in a sweet-smelling</i>

40:44.500 --> 40:46.380
perfume of sweat,

40:46.460 --> 40:48.380
"O...

40:48.460 --> 40:50.050
"Nuit,

40:50.130 --> 40:51.380
"continuous one

40:51.460 --> 40:53.470
<i>"of the heavens,</i>

40:53.550 --> 40:55.390
<i>"let it be</i>

40:55.470 --> 40:57.510
ever thus."

40:57.600 --> 41:00.180
I am the flame that burns

41:00.270 --> 41:01.850
in every heart of man,

41:01.930 --> 41:03.730
and the core of every star.

41:03.810 --> 41:05.730
I am Life,

41:05.810 --> 41:07.560
and the giver of Life,

41:07.650 --> 41:09.570
therefore knowledge of me

41:09.650 --> 41:11.230
is the knowledge of death.

41:11.320 --> 41:14.530
<i>Esta unión es la más seria,</i>

41:14.610 --> 41:16.030
<i>porque Les unirá...</i>

41:16.110 --> 41:18.950
<i>I will lift her</i>

41:19.030 --> 41:21.750
<i>to the pinnacles of power.</i>

41:21.830 --> 41:24.080
<i>I will breed from her</i>

41:24.160 --> 41:25.870
a child greater

41:25.960 --> 41:29.130
than all the kings of the earth.

41:30.170 --> 41:31.300
A new...

41:31.380 --> 41:33.380
<i>high priestess,</i>

41:33.470 --> 41:36.640
<i>a new moon, and a new child.</i>

41:38.180 --> 41:40.260
<i>All auspicious signs</i>

41:40.350 --> 41:43.640
<i>for the coming age of Horus.</i>

41:43.730 --> 41:45.270
Tonight...

41:45.350 --> 41:47.850
we recommit ourselves

41:47.940 --> 41:49.940
to the faith...

41:50.020 --> 41:53.530
in front of all those gathered.

42:02.330 --> 42:04.080
What is this?

42:04.160 --> 42:07.750
You are no longer our Magus.

42:08.750 --> 42:10.500
Jack, what are you doing?

42:10.590 --> 42:12.170
I'm claiming my mantle,

42:12.250 --> 42:14.460
as Frater E.D. intended.

42:14.550 --> 42:16.930
You fool. You fraud.

42:17.010 --> 42:19.140
Crowley himself wills it,

42:19.220 --> 42:20.760
as do the truly ascended

42:20.850 --> 42:22.390
among us.
They know that

42:22.470 --> 42:24.640
I will be a Magus for all,

42:24.720 --> 42:27.140
- not just for one.
- Don't do this.

42:27.230 --> 42:29.190
It's already done.

42:29.270 --> 42:31.150
As my first official act,

42:31.230 --> 42:34.110
we will proceed
directly to the workings.

42:34.190 --> 42:36.490
But please don't forget
your cakes of light.

42:36.570 --> 42:39.990
They have a new,
special ingredient.

42:40.070 --> 42:43.370
I wanted to ensure
that tonight's mass

42:43.450 --> 42:45.910
is one for the ages.

42:55.960 --> 42:57.670
<i>El cuerpo de Cristo.</i>

42:59.970 --> 43:01.300
<i>El cuerpo de Cristo.</i>

43:29.960 --> 43:33.170
There's always Mexico.

43:33.250 --> 43:35.340
We could start afresh.

43:38.920 --> 43:40.970
If we leave, then he wins.

46:29.180 --> 46:30.550
Good morning.

46:30.640 --> 46:33.140
I'm here about the
ad for tenants.

46:41.610 --> 46:43.570
I've heard a lot of things

46:43.650 --> 46:46.030
about you, Mr.
Parsons. All bad.

46:46.110 --> 46:48.110
Very bad.

46:48.200 --> 46:50.370
Just my kind of thing.

46:52.120 --> 46:53.410
Mm-hmm.

46:53.490 --> 46:55.200
And you are?

46:55.290 --> 46:57.290
Lafayette Ronald Hubbard.

46:57.370 --> 46:58.920
But my friends call me Ron.
