WEBVTT

00:02.600 --> 00:03.828
<i>My name is Barry Allen,</i>

00:03.920 --> 00:05.434
<i>and I am
the fastest man alive.</i>

00:05.520 --> 00:07.193
<i>To the outside world,</i>

00:07.280 --> 00:09.192
<i>I'm an ordinary
forensic scientist.</i>

00:09.320 --> 00:10.595
<i>But secretly, with the help</i>

00:10.680 --> 00:12.319
<i>of my friends
at S.T.A.R. Labs,</i>

00:12.400 --> 00:13.856
<i>I fight crime
and find other meta-humans</i>

00:13.880 --> 00:15.200
<i>like me.</i>

00:15.280 --> 00:17.556
<i>But when my daughter came back
from the future to help,</i>

00:17.640 --> 00:19.359
<i>she changed the present</i>

00:19.960 --> 00:22.475
<i>and now our world is
more dangerous than ever</i>

00:22.560 --> 00:24.870
<i>and I'm the only one
fast enough to save it.</i>

00:25.000 --> 00:27.435
<i>I am the Flash.</i>

00:28.360 --> 00:29.874
<i>Previously on</i> The Flash...

00:29.960 --> 00:30.960
Save her.

00:31.000 --> 00:33.310
<i>My life is a million times
better than what it was.</i>

00:33.400 --> 00:35.153
<i>and it's all because
of you, Gracie.</i>

00:35.240 --> 00:36.276
Got you some groceries

00:36.360 --> 00:37.656
and some meloxicam
for your injuries.

00:37.680 --> 00:39.114
We call it the cure.

00:39.200 --> 00:42.079
It's a serum that suppresses
dark matter in meta-humans.

00:42.160 --> 00:43.992
You're the first person
to take it.

00:44.080 --> 00:46.640
I think we should offer
the cure to Cicada.

00:46.720 --> 00:49.189
<i>From the journal
of Nora West-Allen:</i>

00:49.280 --> 00:51.511
<i>"The timeline is malleable."</i>

00:51.600 --> 00:53.398
<i>Why is she hiding
this interest?</i>

00:53.480 --> 00:54.994
Tell me you know
what you're doing.

00:55.080 --> 00:57.356
I am the only speedster
who knows what he's doing!

00:57.440 --> 00:59.272
Stick with the plan.

01:09.600 --> 01:12.593
The cure is finished,
and it works.

01:12.680 --> 01:13.875
Now we can use it on Dwyer,

01:13.960 --> 01:17.032
and then his connection
to the dagger will be broken.

01:20.840 --> 01:21.840
What's wrong?

01:21.920 --> 01:24.992
The timeline.

01:25.080 --> 01:27.959
I've charted this timeline
from Anthro the First Boy

01:28.040 --> 01:29.315
to Kamandi the Last.

01:29.440 --> 01:30.840
I know all of it.

01:30.920 --> 01:32.434
I know its crests,
I know its valleys,

01:32.520 --> 01:35.080
I know what we must do
to defeat Cicada.

01:35.160 --> 01:38.358
Or rather, I knew.

01:39.640 --> 01:41.916
This is a photo of the last
public sighting

01:42.000 --> 01:43.150
of the Flash and Cicada.

01:43.240 --> 01:44.560
Their final confrontation.

01:44.640 --> 01:47.280
Dad's last chance to use
the cure on Cicada.

01:47.360 --> 01:49.200
I've been trying to engineer
a moment like this

01:49.240 --> 01:50.376
the whole time I've been there.

01:50.400 --> 01:53.120
Now, watch.

01:54.160 --> 01:55.230
See this?

01:56.480 --> 02:00.474
That is a new timeline
struggling to break through,

02:00.560 --> 02:04.076
manifesting itself
right before our eyes.

02:04.160 --> 02:06.880
Is it a good timeline,
or is it a bad timeline?

02:06.960 --> 02:08.110
That doesn't matter.

02:08.199 --> 02:10.999
What matters is it's new
and, as such, unpredictable,

02:11.080 --> 02:14.073
and we may lose
our window of opportunity.

02:14.160 --> 02:17.278
So we need to find Cicada
before the timeline changes.

02:18.760 --> 02:20.638
Why did it change?

02:20.720 --> 02:22.393
Did I screw something up?

02:22.480 --> 02:24.312
No.

02:26.280 --> 02:28.192
No.

02:28.280 --> 02:30.351
You've done very well,
little runner.

02:30.440 --> 02:34.719
But a new variable is coming,
something big is coming.

02:37.440 --> 02:39.716
Or someone.

02:43.240 --> 02:44.776
<i>Well, it's interesting
that you say that, sir,</i>

02:44.800 --> 02:46.712
since it's your company
that's denying

02:46.800 --> 02:48.837
the Robertson's family's claim.

02:48.920 --> 02:52.470
Yes, of course, I have the
contract right in front of me.

02:54.080 --> 02:56.515
And it says that animal attacks

02:56.600 --> 02:58.398
do not fall under
Acts of God,

02:58.480 --> 03:00.915
and that includes gorillas.

03:01.000 --> 03:03.196
The Citizen looks forward
to your statement.

03:04.520 --> 03:05.954
- Thanks, babe.
- Mm-hmm.

03:06.080 --> 03:07.594
Are you ready
to do this thing now?

03:07.680 --> 03:09.273
Hell yeah,
we just got to find Nora.

03:09.360 --> 03:10.510
It's her big day after all.

03:10.600 --> 03:12.096
You don't think she's too busy,
do you?

03:12.120 --> 03:13.793
Okay, people, think!

03:13.920 --> 03:15.760
We haven't seen Cicada
since the rooftop fight,

03:15.880 --> 03:17.896
which means the only way to
track him down is to figure out

03:17.920 --> 03:19.593
who his next meta-human
target's gonna be.

03:19.680 --> 03:21.911
Have we double checked
every bank robbery,

03:22.000 --> 03:23.514
every lab break-in?

03:23.640 --> 03:25.496
Yes, yes! We have looked
at all of that, all right?

03:25.520 --> 03:27.557
And all the criminals
that are in custody

03:27.640 --> 03:29.279
are simply mere mortals.

03:29.360 --> 03:30.680
What about the ones
on the street?

03:30.760 --> 03:32.216
Frost says that no new metas
have shown up

03:32.240 --> 03:33.640
since Norvock went into witsec.

03:33.720 --> 03:35.791
Are the satellites tracking
for dark matter

03:35.880 --> 03:37.519
or meta-gene bursts
or Element X?

03:37.600 --> 03:39.353
Yes, yes, and yes.

03:39.440 --> 03:41.113
They're scanning
for everything.

03:41.240 --> 03:43.277
Congratulations,
you raised a menace.

03:43.360 --> 03:45.716
Your daughter, so energetic.

03:45.800 --> 03:49.032
This is pretty impressive.

03:50.760 --> 03:52.956
Um, and I... and I know
with the cure working,

03:53.040 --> 03:54.633
we're all ready
to put Cicada to rest,

03:54.720 --> 03:56.473
but I'm sure
he'll resurface soon.

03:56.560 --> 03:57.736
And then you're going
to give him the chance

03:57.760 --> 03:59.080
to take the meta-human cure?

03:59.160 --> 04:00.310
Yes, exactly.

04:00.400 --> 04:02.631
Even Dwyer deserves a choice.

04:02.760 --> 04:04.536
We just got to convince him
to do the right thing.

04:04.560 --> 04:05.835
Are you ready?

04:05.920 --> 04:07.752
This is gonna be one
of the biggest challenges

04:07.800 --> 04:09.120
of your career as a hero.

04:09.200 --> 04:10.416
Do you know what
you're going to say?

04:14.800 --> 04:16.791
Oh, yeah... you know, yeah.

04:16.880 --> 04:20.396
I've... I've got
some loose thoughts.

04:20.480 --> 04:21.480
Oh, great.

04:21.560 --> 04:23.456
Well, that instills all of us
with confidence, right?

04:23.480 --> 04:25.358
Loose thoughts?
What are you going to say?

04:25.440 --> 04:27.352
"Hey, most bloodthirsty enemy!
Stop."

04:28.520 --> 04:30.910
Guys, it worked for Marlize.

04:31.040 --> 04:33.157
Maybe not so much
for Savitar, but...

04:33.240 --> 04:35.391
I will figure out what to say
to him, all right?

04:35.480 --> 04:36.516
I got this.

04:36.600 --> 04:37.875
I know you do, Dad.

04:37.960 --> 04:40.998
Which is why we need to try
everything to try and find him.

04:41.080 --> 04:42.080
Okay?

04:42.120 --> 04:43.440
Maybe we should go on patrol?

04:43.520 --> 04:45.398
Patrol, you say?
What this is, World War Il?

04:45.480 --> 04:48.359
Oh, wow.
Wow, this is crazy.

04:48.440 --> 04:51.080
There is something nuts
going on at Jitters.

04:51.160 --> 04:52.496
- Do you think it's a meta-human?
- Probably.

04:52.520 --> 04:53.954
It might be.

04:54.040 --> 04:56.111
- We should check it out.
- Yeah.

04:56.200 --> 04:57.429
- For sure.
- Yeah.

04:57.520 --> 04:58.670
Yeah. Go.

05:01.320 --> 05:02.959
- You two did this.
- You made her.

05:03.040 --> 05:04.040
You are responsible.

05:15.480 --> 05:16.800
Well, well, well.

05:16.880 --> 05:19.873
It is nice to see someone
back at his desk

05:19.960 --> 05:21.599
Oh, hey, Foxy.

05:21.680 --> 05:22.680
It's good to be back.

05:22.800 --> 05:25.998
After three months of sipping
Wally's Tibetan butter tea,

05:26.080 --> 05:28.879
I actually kind of missed
this break room coffee.

05:28.960 --> 05:31.077
Ugh. Uh-uh.

05:31.160 --> 05:32.936
Hey, you got any idea
where I can get my hands

05:32.960 --> 05:34.440
on the Cicada task force file?

05:34.560 --> 05:36.199
Babe, you're standing in it.

05:36.280 --> 05:37.873
What?

05:37.960 --> 05:40.270
I've been trying to catch up
on what I've been missing.

05:40.400 --> 05:41.400
Oh.

05:41.480 --> 05:43.631
Uh, speaking of which...

05:43.720 --> 05:45.200
you ever seen this woman?

05:45.320 --> 05:48.119
Uh, Dr. Vanessa Ambres.

05:48.240 --> 05:49.720
Born and raised
in Central City,

05:49.800 --> 05:51.951
got her MD from McNider U.

05:52.080 --> 05:53.719
Oh, that's interesting.

05:53.800 --> 05:56.076
This says she treated
Orlin Dwyer and Grace Gibbons

05:56.160 --> 05:57.296
on the night
of the Enlightenment.

05:57.320 --> 06:00.358
Yes, and she has been
treating Grace ever since,

06:00.440 --> 06:02.238
even though
she's an ER doctor,

06:02.320 --> 06:04.471
and the nurses report
a whole slew of drugs

06:04.560 --> 06:05.755
missing from the coma ward.

06:05.840 --> 06:08.150
You think
she's working with Dwyer?

06:08.240 --> 06:10.118
The guy got stabbed,
struck by lightning.

06:10.200 --> 06:11.839
He's got a hole in his chest.

06:11.920 --> 06:13.296
Somebody has got
to be patching him up, right?

06:13.320 --> 06:15.710
I think we should be asking
the doctor a few questions.

06:15.800 --> 06:17.792
All right, let's do it.

06:19.080 --> 06:20.673
Oh, you want to come with?

06:20.760 --> 06:22.433
Yeah, I want to come with.
What?

06:22.520 --> 06:24.000
Uh, yeah, yeah.

06:24.080 --> 06:25.958
- Yeah!
- All right, partner.

06:26.040 --> 06:28.077
- Partner. I like that.
- Yeah.

06:30.120 --> 06:31.395
Okay, I thought something big

06:31.480 --> 06:32.616
was supposed to be
going on down here.

06:32.640 --> 06:34.677
Oh, I don't know.
It's pretty big.

06:34.760 --> 06:40.677
Feast your eyes on the newest
addition to the Jitters menu.

06:42.560 --> 06:44.870
The XS-presso.

06:44.960 --> 06:46.096
I got my own drink!

06:46.120 --> 06:48.191
It's pretty schway, right?

06:48.280 --> 06:49.873
Think of what could be next.

06:49.960 --> 06:52.077
An XS action figure?
XS Day?

06:52.160 --> 06:53.992
Guys,
you are embarrassing me.

06:54.080 --> 06:55.120
We're just really excited.

06:55.200 --> 06:57.396
I mean, we still haven't
even gone on a trip together

06:57.520 --> 07:00.240
or made Grandma Esther's famous
sweet potato pie recipe.

07:00.320 --> 07:02.080
Did you put karaoke
on the list like I asked?

07:02.160 --> 07:03.160
I think so, actually.

07:03.240 --> 07:04.799
Just a sec...
let me see this.

07:06.960 --> 07:09.429
Okay, there are so many things
on this list.

07:09.520 --> 07:10.856
- Mm-hmm.
- Well, I mean, we've got time.

07:12.480 --> 07:14.176
Okay, is that a real alert
or another fake one?

07:14.200 --> 07:15.200
No, this one's real.

07:15.280 --> 07:17.158
M20 at CCU Chemistry Department.

07:17.240 --> 07:19.197
- A meta attack.
- Yeah, let's go. Come on.

07:25.080 --> 07:26.480
Been a while
since high school chem,

07:26.560 --> 07:29.200
but that does not look like
proper lab safety.

07:29.280 --> 07:32.956
I need this!
Leave me alone!

07:40.080 --> 07:42.879
Sodium bicarbonate
neutralizes any acid.

07:42.960 --> 07:44.758
You have the cuffs?

07:53.520 --> 07:54.874
Let's go get him.

07:54.960 --> 07:56.713
- We don't need to.
- What?

07:56.800 --> 07:58.393
Look at this burn mark.

08:00.760 --> 08:03.195
That acid guy, he...
he must've been there

08:03.280 --> 08:04.280
when the photo was taken.

08:04.360 --> 08:06.158
What are you talking about?

08:06.240 --> 08:09.995
Dad, today's the day
you stop Cicada.

08:15.480 --> 08:17.576
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Slow down. Say that again?

08:17.600 --> 08:19.796
There's a photo,
it's in The Flash museum,

08:19.880 --> 08:22.111
of Flash and Cicada the last time
they were ever seen

08:22.200 --> 08:23.480
confronting each other
in public,

08:23.520 --> 08:25.079
and in the photo,
by Flash's feet,

08:25.160 --> 08:28.073
the exact same burn mark
left by the meta

08:28.160 --> 08:29.389
that we just fought.

08:29.480 --> 08:31.676
This acid meta
was at their final confrontation?

08:31.760 --> 08:33.751
He must be Cicada's
final target.

08:33.840 --> 08:35.592
His final target
before I vanish

08:35.679 --> 08:36.736
and he starts killing again.

08:36.760 --> 08:40.436
Why you are just telling us
about this crucial meta now?

08:40.520 --> 08:43.797
Because a lot of the stuff
from my timeline

08:43.880 --> 08:44.880
is unreliable.

08:45.000 --> 08:46.536
You know, different metas,
different victims,

08:46.560 --> 08:48.040
different circumstances.

08:48.120 --> 08:50.157
But this time,
everything's exactly the same.

08:50.240 --> 08:51.560
So far.

08:51.640 --> 08:53.632
If Cicada goes
after this acid meta,

08:53.760 --> 08:55.717
that means that today's
the last day

08:55.800 --> 08:57.154
we're going to confront him.

08:57.240 --> 08:59.516
And our last chance
to stop him.

08:59.640 --> 09:02.280
Yeah, all right, well, then,
I gotta figure out exactly

09:02.360 --> 09:03.874
what I'm gonna say to him.

09:03.960 --> 09:05.758
You'll find the words, Dad.
I'll help you.

09:05.840 --> 09:08.196
And I am going to start
working on facial rec

09:08.280 --> 09:09.396
for this Acid Master.

09:09.480 --> 09:10.800
Yup, that's what
I'm going with.

09:10.880 --> 09:12.394
Always trust your gut, kids.

09:12.480 --> 09:14.016
And we'll figure out a way
for you to talk to Cicada

09:14.040 --> 09:16.032
without him killing you.

09:19.840 --> 09:21.752
Well...

09:21.840 --> 09:24.674
if it all works out, then...

09:24.760 --> 09:28.470
looks like today could be
the end of our journey.

09:28.560 --> 09:30.597
Yeah.

09:30.680 --> 09:32.797
And I guess
everyone starts moving on.

09:36.840 --> 09:38.877
- Nora.
- Oh, hey, Mom.

09:38.960 --> 09:41.156
Um, look, I've really gotta
hurry and go help Dad.

09:41.240 --> 09:43.038
Yeah, I know, it's just...

09:43.120 --> 09:45.396
I guess you might be
going home tomorrow.

09:45.520 --> 09:47.318
Yeah, I guess so.
Um, mission accomplished.

09:47.440 --> 09:50.000
Well, if you two need
a break after a while,

09:50.080 --> 09:52.800
Papa Joe taught me the famous
West family right hook.

09:52.880 --> 09:54.519
I-I would love to teach you.

09:56.160 --> 09:57.992
- Nora?
- Sorry, uh, sorry, Mom.

09:58.080 --> 10:00.390
I just, uh,
thought of something

10:00.480 --> 10:02.597
that's going to help Dad...
I-I got to go.

10:07.120 --> 10:09.077
Babe, this is a first!

10:09.160 --> 10:10.799
We've worked together before.

10:10.920 --> 10:12.274
We have, Detective,

10:12.360 --> 10:14.556
but anytime we did anything
even close to this,

10:14.640 --> 10:16.791
I didn't have my abilities.

10:18.760 --> 10:20.911
Okay, here we go.

10:21.000 --> 10:24.755
Uh, if I fiddle with my ring,
you know,

10:24.840 --> 10:26.354
assume that means she's lying

10:26.440 --> 10:28.477
and then you just get in there
and, mm, mm,

10:28.560 --> 10:29.960
do your thing.
You cop it up.

10:33.040 --> 10:35.714
Prednisone, sirolimus,
abatacept.

10:35.800 --> 10:37.996
All drugs classified
as immunosuppressants.

10:38.080 --> 10:40.754
They also happen to have
all been reported stolen

10:40.840 --> 10:41.840
from this facility.

10:41.920 --> 10:43.115
I'm aware of the report.

10:43.200 --> 10:44.200
What I'm wondering

10:44.280 --> 10:45.576
is why it warrants the interest
of the DA?

10:45.600 --> 10:47.592
We believe
that the missing medications

10:47.680 --> 10:49.990
are connected
to a much higher profile case.

10:50.080 --> 10:51.753
Orlin Dwyer.

10:51.840 --> 10:53.911
Grace Gibbons' uncle.

10:54.000 --> 10:56.799
Is he still at large?
I don't really watch the news.

10:58.040 --> 11:00.794
Yes, he's very much at large.

11:00.880 --> 11:03.918
And we have reason to believe
that those exact medications

11:04.000 --> 11:06.216
are the ones that Dwyer would
need to treat his injuries.

11:06.240 --> 11:07.515
What are you saying exactly?

11:07.600 --> 11:10.035
Your records
of the stolen meds

11:10.120 --> 11:12.954
continued after Dwyer stopped
visiting the hospital.

11:13.040 --> 11:14.872
Which means that someone here

11:14.960 --> 11:16.713
may be still supplying them
to him.

11:16.800 --> 11:18.598
Sounds like a good theory,

11:18.680 --> 11:20.080
but I don't know
who that could be.

11:20.160 --> 11:22.311
Everything I know
is in those reports.

11:24.040 --> 11:27.272
Okay, okay.

11:27.360 --> 11:28.635
That's enough for now.

11:28.720 --> 11:30.473
Thank you very much
for your time.

11:30.560 --> 11:32.711
Of course.

11:32.800 --> 11:34.314
What are you doing?

11:34.400 --> 11:36.096
You're just gonna let her
walk away like that?

11:36.120 --> 11:37.952
I-I didn't want to scare her.

11:38.040 --> 11:40.396
We don't have enough evidence.
We don't even have a motive.

11:40.480 --> 11:43.473
So, then, let me
keep doing my thing!

11:43.560 --> 11:45.358
I'm not used to going
into an interview

11:45.440 --> 11:47.397
factoring in
your meta-abilities.

11:47.480 --> 11:49.199
I-I'm used to going in
using my gut.

11:49.280 --> 11:51.078
What about my gut?

11:51.160 --> 11:54.312
All due respect,
this isn't about your gut.

11:54.440 --> 11:55.840
Huh.

11:55.920 --> 11:57.559
Look, Cecile,
what I meant to say was...

11:57.640 --> 11:58.994
No, no, no, no, no, no, Joe.

11:59.080 --> 12:00.878
You said exactly
what you meant,

12:00.960 --> 12:02.679
and you know what? Right now,

12:02.760 --> 12:05.195
I'm about to say
something that I mean.

12:05.280 --> 12:07.636
Maybe we shouldn't be working
on this together after all.

12:10.120 --> 12:11.395
Oh, man.

12:11.480 --> 12:12.994
<i>Okay, the clock's ticking,</i>

12:13.080 --> 12:14.958
and we have no clue
how to convince Cicada

12:15.040 --> 12:16.190
to take the cure,

12:16.280 --> 12:18.476
but we still have
our best weapon.

12:18.560 --> 12:20.870
Your journal.
Your legacy.

12:20.960 --> 12:22.640
One of the biggest things
history remembers

12:22.760 --> 12:24.274
about The Flash is your ability

12:24.360 --> 12:26.352
to change people's
hearts and minds,

12:26.440 --> 12:27.635
especially your enemies',

12:27.720 --> 12:30.360
and I have dozens of entries
about those times.

12:30.440 --> 12:32.193
Any chance you've got
the future words

12:32.280 --> 12:33.760
I say to Cicada in there?

12:33.840 --> 12:36.036
Nope,
but I have your past words.

12:36.120 --> 12:39.477
Magenta, she wanted to drop
an oil tanker on a hospital,

12:39.560 --> 12:41.597
but you convinced her
she was a good person.

12:41.680 --> 12:44.673
You said, "Use that good
to beat the bad."

12:44.760 --> 12:47.400
Magenta had
split personalities.

12:47.480 --> 12:49.517
She literally had a good side
and a bad side.

12:49.600 --> 12:51.353
That's not gonna work
with Cicada.

12:51.440 --> 12:52.794
Leonard Snart,

12:52.880 --> 12:54.200
he said he didn't want
to be saved

12:54.240 --> 12:57.597
and you still found a way to
convince him to save himself.

12:57.680 --> 12:59.194
"There's a part of you
that knows

12:59.280 --> 13:01.000
you don't have to let
your past define you."

13:01.040 --> 13:05.159
Except Snart had already
worked with us at that point.

13:05.240 --> 13:08.870
Killer Frost,
you dared her to kill you.

13:08.960 --> 13:10.917
"Come on, live up to your name,
Killer Frost!"

13:11.000 --> 13:12.354
- And what did she do?
- Nora.

13:12.440 --> 13:14.272
Amunet, Plastique,
the list goes on and on.

13:14.360 --> 13:18.320
Nora, all... all of these times
are... are different.

13:18.440 --> 13:21.512
Cicada doesn't even care
if he lives when this is over.

13:21.600 --> 13:24.798
What am I supposed to say
that he'll care about?

13:24.880 --> 13:28.191
You'll know.
The Flash always knows.

13:34.720 --> 13:37.633
So, when you think about it,
an anti-dampening array

13:37.720 --> 13:39.313
is the way to stop him
in his tracks.

13:39.400 --> 13:41.536
Sherloque, are you happy
to be going home soon?

13:41.560 --> 13:42.960
Of course
I'm happy to go back.

13:43.040 --> 13:45.157
I just feel that...

13:45.240 --> 13:47.277
somehow there's more work
to be done here.

13:47.360 --> 13:50.432
I think he's, uh,
talking about his lady friend.

13:50.520 --> 13:53.592
You know, I have a bit
of experience with these, uh,

13:53.680 --> 13:55.353
long-distance relationships.

13:55.440 --> 13:57.875
I got one word for you:
holo-cube.

13:57.960 --> 13:59.679
These things work wonders.

13:59.760 --> 14:02.000
Could I request that you stop
speaking, possibly forever?

14:02.080 --> 14:04.311
I can deduce from your
conversation when you came in

14:04.400 --> 14:06.995
that you have indeed tracked
down Cicada's next target

14:07.080 --> 14:09.117
but do need help
facilitating the conversation

14:09.240 --> 14:10.400
between Cicada and The Flash.

14:10.480 --> 14:11.834
Correct? Yes?
Oh, good.

14:11.920 --> 14:13.720
Come with me and I will
give you the solution.

14:13.760 --> 14:15.479
When did you figure it out?

14:19.760 --> 14:22.036
I will miss you both
very much.

14:24.000 --> 14:25.992
But you will miss me more!
<i>Allez!</i>

14:29.320 --> 14:31.152
Philip Master!

14:52.320 --> 14:53.754
We good?

14:53.840 --> 14:56.753
Yes, Philip Master is secure
in the pipeline.

14:56.840 --> 15:00.197
Wait, Acid Master's real name
is Philip Master?

15:00.280 --> 15:03.432
This is it.
Just like in the photo.

15:03.520 --> 15:06.592
The last confrontation
between Flash and Cicada.

15:11.920 --> 15:13.115
Oh, what's the matter?

15:13.200 --> 15:15.032
You don't have one of these?

15:16.440 --> 15:17.760
Bye-bye.

15:20.480 --> 15:22.039
Cicada!

15:27.800 --> 15:29.200
How long does he have?

15:29.320 --> 15:32.119
He has to hold that dagger
for 60 seconds, maybe less.

15:32.240 --> 15:34.391
Flash better figure out
what he's going to say fast.

15:34.480 --> 15:36.472
He will. I know he will.

15:36.560 --> 15:38.199
I don't want to fight.

15:40.320 --> 15:42.198
We have a cure.

15:42.280 --> 15:44.670
What are you talking about?

15:44.760 --> 15:48.037
We have a way
to cure meta-humans.

15:48.120 --> 15:50.874
We have a way to take
their powers away.

15:52.720 --> 15:54.234
We want you to take it.

15:54.320 --> 15:58.280
And why would I agree
to do that?

16:05.520 --> 16:06.840
Your legacy.

16:08.520 --> 16:10.796
<i>I know how this ends.</i>

16:10.880 --> 16:13.111
You keep killing,

16:13.240 --> 16:16.358
and you're remembered
as a monster, not a hero.

16:16.440 --> 16:18.193
But we can change that
together,

16:18.280 --> 16:20.397
you can have
a different legacy.

16:20.480 --> 16:22.119
You just have to choose it.

16:37.520 --> 16:41.958
I don't give a damn
about my legacy.

17:01.440 --> 17:04.637
That was it.
That was our last chance.

17:15.920 --> 17:18.878
We ran citywide
facial recognition scans

17:18.960 --> 17:20.473
and scanned
for dark matter signals

17:20.599 --> 17:21.636
from Cicada's dagger.

17:21.720 --> 17:23.712
That was our last shot
at confronting Cicada.

17:23.800 --> 17:25.154
We don't know that.

17:25.240 --> 17:26.296
We're changing the timeline.

17:26.319 --> 17:28.436
That photo that Nora saw
at the Flash museum,

17:28.520 --> 17:29.636
it could be different now.

17:29.720 --> 17:30.840
Maybe it doesn't even exist.

17:30.920 --> 17:32.195
After all...

17:33.200 --> 17:35.317
the timeline is malleable.

17:37.040 --> 17:39.271
I just don't understand
why our plan didn't work.

17:39.360 --> 17:41.556
Yeah, you guys
did everything right.

17:41.640 --> 17:42.736
The only reason it didn't work

17:42.760 --> 17:44.160
is because
I couldn't convince him.

17:44.240 --> 17:46.072
Dad, you're the Flash.

17:46.160 --> 17:49.790
When the Flash speaks honestly
from his heart, people listen.

17:49.920 --> 17:52.480
Not all people.

17:52.560 --> 17:53.789
Let's keep searching.

17:53.880 --> 17:56.236
I'm gonna check
the Cicada files at CCPD.

17:56.320 --> 17:57.959
See if I missed anything.

18:01.040 --> 18:03.635
Nora.

18:03.720 --> 18:05.712
We just... we just
need to create

18:05.800 --> 18:07.757
another window
of opportunity, okay?

18:07.840 --> 18:09.718
Dad can convince Cicada
to take the cure.

18:09.800 --> 18:13.476
He just... he just needs
to find the right words.

18:20.240 --> 18:21.640
Barr.

18:21.720 --> 18:23.074
What are you doing here
so late?

18:23.160 --> 18:25.880
We hit a wall at S.T.A.R. Labs
tracking Cicada.

18:25.960 --> 18:28.953
Thought a change of scenery
would help, but...

18:29.040 --> 18:31.714
Keep your head up, man.

18:31.800 --> 18:34.634
We'll find him.
We always do.

18:34.720 --> 18:38.873
Honestly, I'm more worried
about what happens when we do.

18:38.960 --> 18:43.113
Our whole plan depends on me
being able to convince Dwyer

18:43.200 --> 18:45.760
to just take the cure.

18:45.840 --> 18:47.320
The last time I tried...

18:48.800 --> 18:51.076
I don't think I've ever struck out
so hard.

18:51.160 --> 18:52.640
Wow, that's saying a lot

18:52.720 --> 18:54.552
considering your track record
at the plate.

18:54.640 --> 18:57.838
Wait, what exactly
did you say to him?

18:59.840 --> 19:02.639
That he was creating
a legacy of fear,

19:02.720 --> 19:05.519
one that would go down
in history,

19:05.600 --> 19:10.197
but that we could work together
to change that.

19:10.280 --> 19:13.956
That sounds like
something the Flash would say.

19:14.040 --> 19:15.315
Well, I am the Flash.

19:15.400 --> 19:16.880
Look, that man's a zealot.

19:16.960 --> 19:18.360
He sees you in that suit

19:18.440 --> 19:19.896
and all he sees
is the thing he hates.

19:19.920 --> 19:21.240
Meta-human, superpowers,

19:21.320 --> 19:22.936
the thing that took his niece
away from him.

19:22.960 --> 19:24.917
He can't see past the Flash,

19:25.000 --> 19:26.080
but what he doesn't know...

19:26.160 --> 19:28.516
there's a whole lot
more to you than that.

19:30.120 --> 19:32.999
Be more Barry Allen.
Human.

19:34.880 --> 19:35.996
Yeah, you're right.

19:36.080 --> 19:37.958
Thanks. I'm gonna dive back in.

19:38.040 --> 19:39.800
I'll let you get back
to running down Ambres.

19:39.880 --> 19:41.758
Actually...

19:41.840 --> 19:44.833
me and Cecile ran
into a wall ourselves.

19:44.920 --> 19:48.596
We are... uh, she... like,
working together.

19:48.680 --> 19:52.196
I mean, ever since
she got her powers,

19:52.280 --> 19:56.115
it's like she's
a human lie detector.

19:56.200 --> 19:57.350
How is that a bad thing?

19:57.440 --> 19:59.238
You know I've always
prided myself

19:59.320 --> 20:01.960
on being able to read people,
right?

20:02.040 --> 20:07.035
But Cecile and these powers,
I mean, she puts me to shame.

20:07.120 --> 20:08.395
Well, you just
got to remember

20:08.480 --> 20:09.800
that you guys are a team.

20:09.880 --> 20:11.599
That makes her strengths
your strengths

20:11.680 --> 20:13.956
and yours hers.

20:14.040 --> 20:15.536
So if you let her
do what she's great at,

20:15.560 --> 20:17.233
it's only going to
create more room

20:17.360 --> 20:19.136
for you to do more of what
you're great at too, right?

20:21.320 --> 20:24.313
Well, damn.

20:24.400 --> 20:27.313
You're getting real good
at these pep talks, Barr.

20:27.400 --> 20:29.710
Well, I had
a pretty good teacher.

20:37.480 --> 20:39.039
Hey, Nora.

20:39.120 --> 20:40.120
Hi, Nora.

20:40.200 --> 20:41.270
Yeah.

20:41.360 --> 20:43.272
Do you want to turn
that down a little bit?

20:43.360 --> 20:45.352
Hmm? Oh, sorry.

20:46.560 --> 20:48.119
What are you listening to?

20:48.200 --> 20:50.192
Sped-up archives
of the Flash's comm recordings.

20:50.280 --> 20:53.034
I thought that if I listen
to his best appeals,

20:53.120 --> 20:55.351
I could figure out
what exactly worked so well.

20:55.480 --> 20:57.073
And did you?

20:57.160 --> 20:58.514
No, not yet.

20:58.600 --> 21:00.592
But if I run the transcripts
through the computer,

21:00.680 --> 21:02.797
I can extrapolate
recurring key words

21:02.880 --> 21:04.473
from his most successful
appeals

21:04.560 --> 21:07.553
and create a sort of
"best of speeches" speech.

21:07.640 --> 21:09.791
Well, um,

21:09.880 --> 21:11.872
why don't you let your dad
think about it

21:11.960 --> 21:14.475
and we could go
to the rooftop of Jitters.

21:14.560 --> 21:16.631
It's a great place
to clear your mind,

21:16.720 --> 21:18.256
plus it's got the best views
in the city.

21:18.280 --> 21:21.079
You want to go sightseeing?
Right now?

21:21.160 --> 21:23.038
What... is this from
that list of yours?

21:23.120 --> 21:25.191
Well, yeah, but...

21:25.280 --> 21:26.896
All day I've been trying
to figure out a way

21:26.920 --> 21:28.479
to stop Cicada

21:28.560 --> 21:31.120
and all day you've been
trying to pull me away.

21:31.200 --> 21:32.793
Why are you pushing this list?

21:32.880 --> 21:34.234
I mean,
it's just the last time

21:34.320 --> 21:36.880
that we may get
to spend together.

21:36.960 --> 21:38.997
Nora, I mean,
once we stop Cicada,

21:39.080 --> 21:41.640
you'll go back to your time
and...

21:44.160 --> 21:48.598
us like this together will end.

21:48.680 --> 21:50.034
Mom, it doesn't end.

21:50.160 --> 21:51.753
We have our whole future
together.

21:51.840 --> 21:53.696
Yeah, for you it'll feel
like no time has passed

21:53.720 --> 21:58.237
but for me,
it'll be decades before I...

21:58.320 --> 22:00.357
see you like this again.

22:03.440 --> 22:05.477
Uh, no, it's okay.

22:05.560 --> 22:10.874
Um, I will catch up
with you later.

22:18.360 --> 22:19.555
Joe.

22:19.640 --> 22:20.640
What's going on?

22:20.720 --> 22:22.080
Why'd you want me
to meet you here?

22:22.120 --> 22:25.352
Look, I know the last time
we tried to work together

22:25.440 --> 22:26.715
went a bit south.

22:26.800 --> 22:28.200
Oh, a bit?

22:28.280 --> 22:30.636
You're right.
I'm sorry, Cecile.

22:30.720 --> 22:33.679
I let my pride get in the way,

22:33.760 --> 22:36.150
and I didn't lean
on your strengths

22:36.240 --> 22:38.072
when I should have.

22:38.160 --> 22:40.038
But you know me,

22:40.120 --> 22:42.555
I'm not a man who makes
the same mistake twice.

22:42.640 --> 22:44.711
So...

22:49.200 --> 22:50.600
Would you do me the honor

22:50.720 --> 22:53.474
of joining me
in this interrogation?

22:53.600 --> 22:57.355
You do what you do best,
I'll take care of the rest.

23:06.520 --> 23:08.716
Get 'em, girl.

23:09.520 --> 23:10.840
Detective. DA.

23:10.920 --> 23:12.673
This is starting to border
on harassment.

23:12.760 --> 23:14.513
I have told you
everything I know.

23:14.600 --> 23:15.670
That's not true.

23:15.760 --> 23:18.673
We know that you've been
funneling meds to Orlin Dwyer.

23:18.760 --> 23:19.760
Well, if you knew that,

23:19.840 --> 23:22.071
then I'd be arrested
and not sitting here.

23:24.400 --> 23:26.039
Let me correct myself.

23:26.120 --> 23:29.113
We have a strong hunch,

23:29.200 --> 23:30.759
but I bet if we were
to go through

23:30.840 --> 23:33.036
the video camera footage
from the hospital,

23:33.120 --> 23:36.158
we'll find proof
that you were assisting Dwyer.

23:36.240 --> 23:37.276
I'm a doctor.

23:37.360 --> 23:39.829
I mean, why would I condone
a vigilante murderer?

23:39.920 --> 23:42.116
Because of what happened
to Darius.

23:44.640 --> 23:45.676
Darius.

23:48.880 --> 23:51.236
It hurts you
to even think about him.

23:51.320 --> 23:53.471
My fiancé was killed
by meta-humans

23:53.560 --> 23:54.560
during Zoom's rampage.

23:54.640 --> 23:56.233
So, yes, it hurts
to think about him.

23:56.320 --> 24:00.439
Hurt enough for you to help
Dwyer kill other meta-humans?

24:00.520 --> 24:01.670
Correct me if I'm wrong,

24:01.760 --> 24:03.831
you took an oath to do no harm,
right?

24:03.960 --> 24:06.839
Can you truthfully say
you upheld that oath?

24:10.280 --> 24:13.193
That guilt that you feel
right now?

24:13.280 --> 24:15.158
There's a way
to make up for it.

24:15.240 --> 24:17.960
All you have to do
is help us find Orlin.

24:18.040 --> 24:19.997
What, so... so you can put him
in jail? Kill him?

24:20.080 --> 24:22.231
No, so we can cure him.

24:22.320 --> 24:23.470
It's not possible.

24:23.560 --> 24:25.836
Maybe not with the medicine
you've been giving him,

24:25.920 --> 24:28.116
but S.T.A.R. Labs
has created a treatment

24:28.200 --> 24:32.513
that turns metas back
into normal human beings.

24:35.280 --> 24:36.919
I can't take you to him.

24:37.000 --> 24:39.560
Okay, okay,
then help us set up a meet.

24:39.640 --> 24:41.711
Look, Dr. Ambres, it's clear.

24:41.800 --> 24:44.315
You've come to truly care
for Dwyer.

24:44.400 --> 24:47.598
So we're asking you now...

24:47.680 --> 24:49.751
help us save his life.

24:56.000 --> 24:59.437
I can make contact,
and I can share the location.

25:02.040 --> 25:03.554
I have rounds in an hour

25:03.640 --> 25:05.359
and patients
that I can save tonight.

25:05.480 --> 25:07.119
So am I free to go, please?

25:16.120 --> 25:17.793
I love my job.

25:17.880 --> 25:20.349
I can stay here all night.

25:20.440 --> 25:24.070
And we will, unless you tell us
what you're keeping hidden

25:24.160 --> 25:25.594
right now.

25:30.320 --> 25:32.596
Yo, yo. I got your text.
You talked to Ambres?

25:32.680 --> 25:35.718
Cecile and I together
got through to her.

25:35.800 --> 25:38.315
She's going to show us
where to find Dwyer.

25:38.400 --> 25:39.470
Joe, that's amazing.

25:39.560 --> 25:41.791
Yeah, Ambres told us
something else.

25:41.880 --> 25:45.510
Dwyer's niece, Grace?
She's a meta.

25:52.320 --> 25:54.915
So <i>le petit</i> Dwyer is a meta.

25:55.000 --> 25:57.720
Wait, I thought we scanned Grace
for meta powers

25:57.800 --> 25:59.439
when Nora entered her brain.

25:59.520 --> 26:02.080
We did, but that was back
when her DNA was 100 percent human.

26:02.160 --> 26:03.560
Her powers must have
activated

26:03.640 --> 26:05.154
in just the last few weeks,
right?

26:05.240 --> 26:08.677
Yeah, Ambres told Joe
that the wound in Grace's head

26:08.760 --> 26:10.672
recently started glowing
and mutating.

26:10.760 --> 26:15.437
Now all we need to do is get
Dwyer to listen to you, again.

26:15.520 --> 26:18.080
Killer Frost can put him
on ice from the neck down.

26:18.160 --> 26:20.675
Better yet, I can re-sequence
the Speed Force Bazooka

26:20.760 --> 26:22.638
to overload him
with negative tachyons

26:22.720 --> 26:24.176
so that he's just stuck there,
listening to him.

26:24.200 --> 26:26.096
Tachyon, shmack-yon.
No, no. <i>La Machine à Mémoire!</i>

26:26.120 --> 26:27.360
We could go inside
Dwyer's mind.

26:29.840 --> 26:32.196
- Guys...
- No, <i>La Machine à Mémoire!</i>

26:32.280 --> 26:34.715
Guys, hey!

26:34.800 --> 26:37.110
I appreciate the enthusiasm,

26:37.240 --> 26:40.438
but I think we need to take
a different approach.

26:40.520 --> 26:44.833
No powers, no crazy plans.

26:44.920 --> 26:47.071
The Flash can't convince
Cicada to stop this,

26:47.160 --> 26:50.551
but... maybe...

26:50.640 --> 26:52.597
I can.

26:56.200 --> 26:58.032
- Hey.
- Hey.

26:58.120 --> 26:59.120
Dad's back.

26:59.200 --> 27:01.954
He says Papa Joe's
got news about Dwyer.

27:02.040 --> 27:04.953
Okay, good. I guess we should
get over to the Cortex.

27:06.400 --> 27:07.914
You know, I had a list too.

27:09.920 --> 27:13.470
Your wedding,
Auntie Jenna's baby shower,

27:13.560 --> 27:16.598
Jitters, The Enlightenment.

27:20.520 --> 27:22.671
Those were all
the moments in time

27:22.760 --> 27:24.353
you wanted to go back
and see us?

27:24.440 --> 27:27.194
Yeah, so I could have
memories and experiences

27:27.280 --> 27:29.272
with all of you.

27:29.360 --> 27:30.794
I get it.

27:30.880 --> 27:34.669
I should've been sensitive
and I-I'm so sorry.

27:34.760 --> 27:37.639
- It's okay.
- No, it's not.

27:37.720 --> 27:40.952
I was so focused on making sure
Flash beat Cicada,

27:41.040 --> 27:45.956
I forgot what I was supposed
to really be focused on.

27:46.040 --> 27:48.760
You and Dad.

27:48.840 --> 27:51.719
You're the reason
I came back to this time,

27:51.800 --> 27:56.477
not fighting big bads
or getting my own XS-presso.

27:56.560 --> 27:59.917
It was so that I could spend time
with my parents.

28:00.000 --> 28:02.560
My family.

28:02.640 --> 28:04.996
I don't know how much time
we have left together

28:05.120 --> 28:08.238
or how much of your list
we're going to get done,

28:08.320 --> 28:12.394
but from now on,
every moment we have left,

28:12.480 --> 28:14.199
we're going to make it
a memorable one.

28:14.280 --> 28:15.555
I promise.

28:22.080 --> 28:25.278
Well, I guess we can cross off
"hugging while drinking tea"

28:25.360 --> 28:27.079
- off our list.
- Yeah.

28:27.160 --> 28:29.959
Hey, guys,
sorry to interrupt.

28:30.040 --> 28:32.191
No, it's fine.
We were just...

28:32.280 --> 28:34.511
We were just talking
about Mom's list.

28:36.440 --> 28:39.000
Um, so I heard Dad
has a lead on Dwyer?

28:39.080 --> 28:40.799
We have a location.

28:40.880 --> 28:42.360
I'm going to head there
any minute.

28:42.440 --> 28:45.239
Does Flash know what
he's going to say this time?

28:47.200 --> 28:51.035
Actually, I think
I'm just gonna talk to him,

28:51.120 --> 28:53.237
father to father.

28:53.320 --> 28:55.198
That's a really good idea,
Dad.

29:09.160 --> 29:10.879
Hey, Doc.

29:13.200 --> 29:16.477
Dr. Ambres told us
where to find you.

29:17.640 --> 29:18.869
I just want to talk.

29:18.960 --> 29:23.273
There's no more talking.

29:23.360 --> 29:28.480
Every time one of you metas
comes near the rest of us,

29:28.560 --> 29:31.234
good people get hurt.

29:31.320 --> 29:34.358
This is what you all deserve.

29:34.440 --> 29:36.352
Does that include Grace?

29:38.680 --> 29:41.798
Ambres hasn't told you.

29:41.880 --> 29:45.351
Grace. She's a meta.

29:45.440 --> 29:47.716
The night
the satellite crashed,

29:47.800 --> 29:49.678
she was hit
with a piece of shrapnel

29:49.760 --> 29:50.955
infected with dark matter.

29:51.040 --> 29:53.396
That's... that's why
she's in a coma,

29:53.520 --> 29:55.716
and now it's changing her.

29:55.800 --> 29:57.951
That's a lie.

29:58.040 --> 30:00.430
And that's why Ambres
told us where to find you.

30:00.520 --> 30:01.874
She's afraid.

30:01.960 --> 30:03.536
She's afraid you're going
to do the one thing

30:03.560 --> 30:04.880
you can't come back from.

30:09.760 --> 30:14.312
I know how much you care
about Grace.

30:14.400 --> 30:17.074
You're trying to make the world
a better place for her.

30:17.160 --> 30:20.039
She didn't choose to be a meta,

30:20.120 --> 30:21.873
but she is.

30:21.960 --> 30:24.236
Does that mean
she deserves to die?

30:24.320 --> 30:26.551
No.

30:26.640 --> 30:29.997
I would never hurt Grace.

30:30.080 --> 30:32.675
Then you'd let her grow up
in a world of fear.

30:32.760 --> 30:35.958
Where there's someone out there
hurting people like her.

30:38.080 --> 30:42.871
The cure,
it will heal Grace and you.

30:52.800 --> 30:56.714
And why should
I believe you, Flash?

31:06.280 --> 31:08.875
Because I'm a father too.

31:08.960 --> 31:11.031
My daughter,

31:11.120 --> 31:15.831
I love her more than
I ever thought possible.

31:15.920 --> 31:17.832
I would do anything
to make the world

31:17.920 --> 31:19.400
a better place for her.

31:22.720 --> 31:24.473
And I think you would too.

31:28.200 --> 31:29.634
So do it.

31:44.760 --> 31:45.876
We made an arrangement.

31:45.960 --> 31:48.873
We cure him and then Grace.

31:48.960 --> 31:50.280
Okay.

31:50.360 --> 31:54.479
Why are we here
and not at a hospital?

31:54.560 --> 31:58.270
We have to be sure
that the cure is successful.

31:58.360 --> 31:59.840
We created it.

31:59.920 --> 32:01.593
We're the ones who know
how it works.

32:01.680 --> 32:04.718
Once administered,
the cure will take 60 seconds

32:04.800 --> 32:07.599
to eliminate the meta-human
powers in your system.

32:07.680 --> 32:10.798
That means the wound
in your chest will then open.

32:10.880 --> 32:12.280
You'll need me
to suture it shut

32:12.360 --> 32:13.794
so you don't bleed out.

32:13.880 --> 32:15.439
Why not Doc Ambres?

32:15.520 --> 32:17.000
She's being held
for questioning.

32:17.120 --> 32:21.797
No, it's Ambres,
or we're done.

32:26.200 --> 32:27.759
All right, we'll get her.

32:27.880 --> 32:30.395
If anything goes wrong,

32:30.480 --> 32:32.790
or if you're lying to me,

32:32.880 --> 32:37.591
I'll kill every... last...

32:37.680 --> 32:38.955
one of you.

32:44.000 --> 32:46.515
And we're certain everything
in this room is sterile?

32:46.600 --> 32:48.876
Of course.

32:48.960 --> 32:50.713
Everything except that.

32:53.040 --> 32:55.794
That thing's not negotiable.

33:00.520 --> 33:02.751
That rage of his, it's...

33:04.640 --> 33:05.915
Joe, I can't.

33:06.000 --> 33:07.000
Are you going to stay?

33:07.080 --> 33:09.311
Uh, yeah, just in case.

33:09.400 --> 33:12.359
- Okay.
- All right, babe.

33:12.440 --> 33:13.715
Good job today.

33:13.800 --> 33:15.917
You too. Partner.

33:21.760 --> 33:24.514
We never could have done this
without you guys.

33:24.600 --> 33:26.159
Well, I'm glad
it worked out,

33:26.240 --> 33:29.358
but when this is over,
he's going to jail,

33:29.440 --> 33:31.671
for a long time.

33:33.200 --> 33:37.956
Okay, one fresh serving
of piping hot meta-human cure.

33:38.040 --> 33:39.936
I'm just supposed to trust
that that thing works?

33:39.960 --> 33:42.191
Has it gone through
any human testing?

33:42.280 --> 33:44.192
It's gone through
giant shark testing.

33:46.200 --> 33:47.554
It's a long story.

33:49.680 --> 33:51.990
It's okay, Doc.

33:52.080 --> 33:54.436
I wanted to tell you
the truth about Grace.

33:54.520 --> 33:57.274
I just couldn't find the words.

33:57.360 --> 34:00.671
You were just trying
to keep her safe.

34:00.760 --> 34:03.070
I'll always be thankful
for that.

34:07.360 --> 34:09.591
See you on the other side.

34:22.000 --> 34:23.514
Here we go.

34:28.480 --> 34:30.597
Injecting the cure.

34:52.800 --> 34:53.916
His vitals are spiking.

34:54.000 --> 34:55.696
How can we tell
if the cure is even working?

34:55.719 --> 34:57.757
Oh, it's working.

35:08.840 --> 35:10.593
My powers are back.

35:10.680 --> 35:12.717
Which means Dwyer's powers
must be gone.

35:17.040 --> 35:19.794
Well...

35:19.880 --> 35:22.520
It appears your sojourn
into the past was a success.

35:22.640 --> 35:24.040
Congratulations.

35:24.120 --> 35:25.679
Thank you.

35:25.760 --> 35:28.639
You as well.
It's your, uh, 38th Cicada?

35:28.720 --> 35:30.074
That's right, yes.

35:30.160 --> 35:31.753
38th Cicada.
<i>Trente-huit</i> Cicada.

35:31.840 --> 35:32.956
<i>Allez-hop!</i>

35:33.040 --> 35:34.997
But, of course,
there's some business here

35:35.080 --> 35:36.912
that remains unfinished.

35:37.000 --> 35:39.469
For instance, how did you know
before you saw the burn marks

35:39.560 --> 35:42.029
in the photograph
that it was a meta-human

35:42.160 --> 35:44.356
that would lead us to Cicada?

35:44.440 --> 35:46.750
Uh, I...

35:46.840 --> 35:48.320
You know, I just had
this feeling

35:48.400 --> 35:50.551
that something big was coming.

35:52.120 --> 35:54.191
They're working on him now.

35:54.280 --> 35:57.273
I will be so happy
when this is all over with.

36:12.280 --> 36:14.078
What's going on?

36:14.160 --> 36:15.799
What happened to the power?

36:15.880 --> 36:18.395
I have no idea.

36:18.480 --> 36:19.630
I should check the Med Lab.

36:20.960 --> 36:22.952
- Someone's coming.
- Who?

36:36.680 --> 36:38.319
Cicada?

37:04.240 --> 37:06.357
Where's that coming from?

37:06.440 --> 37:07.440
Cisco!

37:07.520 --> 37:09.193
- Hold on!
- Iris.

37:09.280 --> 37:11.397
- Careful.
- I can't see anything.

37:11.480 --> 37:12.880
Here.

37:13.000 --> 37:14.514
Cisco, we need power.

37:14.600 --> 37:16.159
We got a much bigger problem.

37:17.480 --> 37:18.709
Cicada?

37:18.800 --> 37:19.960
How the hell did that happen?

37:20.000 --> 37:21.296
I don't know,
but he's coming here

37:21.320 --> 37:22.320
and he looks pissed.

37:22.400 --> 37:23.834
We have to move now.

37:23.920 --> 37:25.016
I've got to keep
patching him up.

37:25.040 --> 37:26.759
Stand back.

37:35.800 --> 37:37.951
There.

37:38.040 --> 37:41.477
- He's in the hallway.
- Get the hell out of here.

38:45.440 --> 38:46.954
Iris! Get down!

39:22.280 --> 39:23.919
Come on!

39:31.480 --> 39:33.153
Who are you?

39:36.880 --> 39:40.794
Please, whoever you are.

39:40.880 --> 39:43.236
I only came here
to make him human again!

39:43.320 --> 39:45.391
I helped him!

40:05.040 --> 40:07.635
Please!

40:07.720 --> 40:09.757
Please don't do this!

40:26.760 --> 40:29.832
Nope. They're all toast.

40:29.920 --> 40:31.479
Well, better the computers
than us.

40:31.560 --> 40:33.517
Joe.

40:33.600 --> 40:34.670
Are you okay?

40:34.760 --> 40:37.480
I'm okay, I'm okay.
I'm a little bruised, but...

40:37.560 --> 40:38.994
Everybody else?

40:39.120 --> 40:40.270
Yeah, we're okay.

40:40.360 --> 40:41.794
Guys...

40:42.720 --> 40:44.359
Dr. Ambres didn't make it.

40:49.040 --> 40:51.271
There's no sign of them
anywhere.

40:51.360 --> 40:53.192
I don't understand
what happened.

40:53.280 --> 40:55.749
I mean, we got Dwyer,
we gave him the cure.

40:55.840 --> 40:58.753
If... if Cicada doesn't exist
anymore, who was that?

41:00.000 --> 41:01.912
Someone worse.

41:34.760 --> 41:37.070
I've missed you...

41:44.000 --> 41:45.912
Uncle Orlin.

42:12.520 --> 42:13.954
<i>Greg, move your head.</i>
