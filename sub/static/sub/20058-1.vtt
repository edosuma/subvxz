00:18.375 --> 00:22.208
Hello, I'm that narrator
you hear in every movie,

00:22.292 --> 00:26.417
TV show, commercial,
and mobile phone traffic app.

00:26.500 --> 00:30.333
Today, I want to welcome you
to a special place.

00:30.417 --> 00:32.958
A place called...

00:33.042 --> 00:35.167
Skylands.

00:53.500 --> 00:57.292
Aw, an itsy-bitsy baby dragon.

00:57.375 --> 00:59.083
I love baby dragons.

00:59.167 --> 01:02.458
Especially medium-rare ones.

01:02.542 --> 01:03.833
Get him, boys!

01:06.917 --> 01:09.833
Ooh, I like my dragon meat smoky.

01:11.208 --> 01:15.000
Come on, little fella, do it again.

01:19.583 --> 01:22.083
My face!
My ugly face!

01:30.833 --> 01:31.958
You win.

01:32.042 --> 01:34.208
Oh, yeah! Spyro wins!

01:34.292 --> 01:36.333
Hello, little one.

01:37.375 --> 01:38.667
I mean you no harm.

01:38.750 --> 01:40.417
You must be hungry.

01:41.417 --> 01:42.750
Barely-touched corn dog?

01:54.542 --> 01:57.167
You are special, little dragon.

01:58.583 --> 02:01.458
Very special indeed.

02:35.417 --> 02:38.875
Our story begins
here at Skylander Academy,

02:38.958 --> 02:42.042
the training grounds
where cadets learn

02:42.125 --> 02:46.083
how to defend the Skylands
against all evil.

02:48.167 --> 02:49.292
Pardon me, coming through!

02:49.375 --> 02:52.667
A very important assistant
with a very important pack-- Ow!

02:54.583 --> 02:55.583
What in the...

02:56.875 --> 03:01.292
Sheep!
Everyone, cower for your lives!

03:01.375 --> 03:03.292
Hugo, chill.
They're harmless.

03:03.375 --> 03:04.500
They are not harmless.

03:04.583 --> 03:08.542
They are harmful.
They are literally full of harm!

03:09.875 --> 03:12.750
Did you see that?
Oh, tell me you all saw that!

03:12.833 --> 03:14.167
Dude, seek help.

03:15.333 --> 03:18.292
I don't mean one therapist.
You need a team.

03:18.375 --> 03:19.667
Yo, what's happening, cadets?

03:19.750 --> 03:21.333
First-years, right?

03:21.417 --> 03:23.667
Yeah, yep, yep, yep,
just like me four years ago.

03:23.750 --> 03:25.667
Well, not exactly like me.

03:25.750 --> 03:27.208
There's only one Spyro.

03:27.292 --> 03:30.292
-Oh! Can I get a selfie with you?
-Totally.

03:35.083 --> 03:37.125
-I'm not even in it.
-You're welcome.

03:37.208 --> 03:39.167
If you're all done
with the Spyro Show,

03:39.250 --> 03:41.167
can we get back
to our game of sheep ball?

03:41.250 --> 03:42.625
Relax, Eruptor.

03:42.708 --> 03:45.083
I'm just giving these cadets
a little memento.

03:45.167 --> 03:46.833
Nobody wants a shot of your butt.

03:46.917 --> 03:48.583
Oh, thank you, thank you,
thank you, thank you!

03:48.667 --> 03:51.000
I think you may owe my butt an apology.

03:51.083 --> 03:53.000
I got this.

03:53.083 --> 03:54.458
Hey!

03:54.542 --> 03:56.500
-What're you doing, Stealth Elf?
-I'm doing this.

03:56.583 --> 03:58.625
- And then some of this.
- Those... things...

03:58.708 --> 04:00.750
are... all... very similar!

04:02.583 --> 04:06.500
Can we please get back to the game now,
oh, Spyro the Great?

04:07.500 --> 04:08.958
Somebody sure is grumpy.

04:09.042 --> 04:11.833
Did you wake up on the wrong side
of the volcano this morning, big guy?

04:11.917 --> 04:14.625
I am not grumpy!

04:19.166 --> 04:21.000
That's grumpy.

04:21.083 --> 04:24.167
Guys, guys, knock it off.
We're on the same team, remember?

04:24.250 --> 04:26.583
Now, grow up and let's get back
to throwing sheep at each other.

04:30.458 --> 04:32.917
Looks like you two
just got saved by the class bell.

04:33.000 --> 04:34.250
So you're forfeiting.

04:34.333 --> 04:37.417
-No way!
-We're just saying you're making us late!

04:37.500 --> 04:38.625
Us?

04:39.542 --> 04:41.250
Aw, magma!

04:42.083 --> 04:43.458
Whoo! Wow!

04:43.958 --> 04:45.958
Spyro wins again!

04:54.500 --> 04:55.500
Mmm.

04:56.667 --> 04:58.417
I saw that!

04:58.500 --> 05:00.667
Cutting it pretty close
for your final class, Miss Elf.

05:10.083 --> 05:12.333
You think anyone noticed me?

05:14.875 --> 05:17.250
I guess your friend Spyro
had better things to--

05:17.333 --> 05:18.917
And I'm here.

05:19.000 --> 05:20.875
Let's do this, JV.

05:20.958 --> 05:24.083
That's Professor Jet-Vac!
And you're late. Again!

05:24.167 --> 05:27.042
You do realize that
once you become a Skylander,

05:27.125 --> 05:29.458
you can't just get by on raw talent!

05:29.542 --> 05:33.375
You have to work hard
and be an equal part of your team!

05:33.458 --> 05:36.208
I'm getting my own team?
I'll call it Team Spyro.

05:36.292 --> 05:38.750
Or just, you know what?
Just Spyro, for brevity.

05:38.833 --> 05:43.208
Class, Spyro here thinks
his actions don't affect others.

05:43.292 --> 05:45.833
But to show him how truly wrong he is...

05:45.917 --> 05:47.875
Pop quiz!

05:50.417 --> 05:53.083
This is all your fault, Spyro!

05:53.167 --> 05:55.042
Hey, hey, it's not always about me.

05:57.708 --> 06:01.125
All right, so one last pop quiz.
Big whoop.

06:01.208 --> 06:03.000
I got this!

06:07.417 --> 06:09.667
Enter.

06:09.750 --> 06:11.375
Sir, I have your package.

06:11.458 --> 06:16.667
And His Awesomeness Spyro
is also waiting outside as you requested.

06:16.750 --> 06:18.750
Go easy on the lad, Hugo.

06:18.833 --> 06:20.917
It's not easy growing up an orphan.

06:21.000 --> 06:23.750
We are the closest thing
he has to family, you know.

06:31.167 --> 06:33.125
Ah, my main man!

06:33.208 --> 06:35.667
-Master Eon!
-Have a seat.

06:35.750 --> 06:39.875
Can you explain your performance
on this air studies quiz, Spyro?

06:39.958 --> 06:42.375
I can, but it won't be
a good explanation.

06:42.458 --> 06:43.625
What?

06:43.708 --> 06:44.708
I passed?

06:44.792 --> 06:46.667
You passed... barely.

06:46.750 --> 06:48.417
Yeah, but I passed.

06:48.500 --> 06:50.500
You didn't need that other word,
because I passed.

06:50.583 --> 06:52.708
"Barely" is a little judgmental.

06:52.792 --> 06:56.375
Spyro, you're on the verge
of becoming a Skylander.

06:56.458 --> 06:57.792
Do you know what that means?

06:57.875 --> 06:59.875
I should start my own fan club?

06:59.958 --> 07:01.708
You're missing the point.

07:01.792 --> 07:05.333
You'll soon be part of something
much bigger than just yourself.

07:05.417 --> 07:07.958
Right, Master, of course.

07:08.042 --> 07:10.708
So you mean I should get someone
to run my fan club for me.

07:10.792 --> 07:12.375
So I'm gonna need headshots, right?

07:12.458 --> 07:15.167
And... Ooh!
I should start practicing my autograph.

07:15.250 --> 07:18.708
Come, let me show you something.

07:25.333 --> 07:27.000
So, it's a bookshelf.

07:27.083 --> 07:29.208
That's not what I want to show you.

07:32.875 --> 07:34.833
Facial hair identified.

07:34.917 --> 07:37.167
Welcome, Master Eon.

07:37.250 --> 07:42.917
Behold, the most precious relics
of all the Skylands.

07:43.000 --> 07:46.583
Whoa. Whoa!
The Giants! SWAP Force!

07:46.667 --> 07:48.458
The Imaginators!

07:48.542 --> 07:50.667
A random candy cane!

07:50.750 --> 07:52.250
Oh, there it is.

07:54.458 --> 07:57.125
And The Book of Skylanders!

07:58.417 --> 08:00.208
Can I touch it?

08:05.917 --> 08:08.208
A simple "no" would have sufficed!

08:08.292 --> 08:11.000
Never gets old.

08:12.667 --> 08:15.667
Upon graduation,
every Skylander is expertly drawn

08:15.750 --> 08:17.708
in this book by yours truly.

08:17.792 --> 08:20.292
I've been looking forward
to inscribing you

08:20.375 --> 08:22.708
since I found you as a hatchling.

08:22.792 --> 08:25.250
You came into the world
fending for yourself,

08:25.333 --> 08:26.750
a born fighter.

08:28.167 --> 08:33.000
I had a feeling deep in my beard
that you were destined for greatness.

08:33.082 --> 08:35.500
But then, after you took
the academy admission test

08:35.582 --> 08:38.000
and received the highest score ever...

08:38.082 --> 08:41.332
Anyway, I've been telling you
since you were born how gifted you are,

08:41.417 --> 08:43.000
for better or worse it seems,

08:43.082 --> 08:47.583
and despite your cockiness, immaturity,
and brazen disregard for fire safety--

08:47.667 --> 08:49.292
Oh, and other kinds of safety.

08:49.375 --> 08:52.708
You see,
this is what I'm talking about!

08:52.792 --> 08:55.792
Ah, I can't help but blame myself
for over-indulging you

08:55.875 --> 08:58.542
and filling your head
with grandiose notions, Spyro.

08:58.625 --> 09:00.208
I can't help
but blame you either,

09:00.292 --> 09:01.917
but I'm totally willing
to forgive you for it...

09:02.000 --> 09:03.417
this time.

09:03.500 --> 09:05.708
I feel perhaps I created a monster

09:05.792 --> 09:08.750
by nurturing your confidence
and talents all these years.

09:09.583 --> 09:12.000
Well, I am a dragon, so...

09:12.083 --> 09:14.917
I'm talking about your unbridled ego!

09:15.917 --> 09:18.042
Now you must stop putting yourself first.

09:18.125 --> 09:21.917
Put your ego aside
and start applying yourself fully.

09:22.625 --> 09:24.250
Can you do this, Spyro?

09:24.333 --> 09:27.042
Of course, I can!
I'm the greatest!

09:27.125 --> 09:29.000
Hey, your words, not mine.

09:29.083 --> 09:32.708
Now, I suggest you go home and rest up
for the Skylander Games tomorrow.

09:32.792 --> 09:34.458
It is your final test, Spyro.

09:34.542 --> 09:38.208
And this time,
barely passing will not be good enough.

09:38.292 --> 09:42.417
And I suggest you get ready
to draw my handsome mug in that book.

09:42.500 --> 09:46.625
This isn't just about flattering portraits
drawn by my skilled hand, Spyro.

09:46.708 --> 09:49.083
It's about keeping
the balance in Skylands.

09:49.167 --> 09:51.417
Your role as a member
of the Skylanders

09:51.500 --> 09:54.375
is to be an agent of peace
and harmony in our world

09:54.458 --> 09:57.625
by defending it against foes
that hunger for anarchy...

09:57.708 --> 09:59.708
...loss, and eternal darkness.

09:59.792 --> 10:05.000
Threats that seem to be growing in number
and power with each passing day, I fear.

10:05.083 --> 10:08.875
And of all the villains we face,
none is more committed to the cause

10:08.958 --> 10:11.208
of destroying
our peaceful way of life than...

10:11.292 --> 10:13.208
Kaos!

10:13.292 --> 10:15.583
I'm down here, Glumshanks,
in the plotting chamber.

10:15.667 --> 10:18.292
I brought your scalding hot beverage,
as requested.

10:19.000 --> 10:20.875
Excellent!

10:22.500 --> 10:24.458
Well tossed, sir.

10:24.542 --> 10:26.625
Well, you seem to be
in a particularly evil mood today.

10:26.708 --> 10:28.667
Ooh, thank you for noticing!

10:28.750 --> 10:31.000
Yes, it's been a productive day so far.

10:31.083 --> 10:34.792
For instance, I just finished burying
a prisoner alive to get him to talk.

10:34.875 --> 10:36.958
How will you know
when he's ready to talk?

10:37.042 --> 10:38.375
Eh?

10:38.458 --> 10:41.167
Guess what else I did, Glumshanks?

10:41.250 --> 10:43.375
You formulated a plot
to finally defeat the Skylanders.

10:43.458 --> 10:44.708
How did you know?

10:47.333 --> 10:48.542
Shot in the dark.

10:48.625 --> 10:51.667
Well, my latest scheme
is so stupendously evil

10:51.750 --> 10:57.375
that it will be the end of every Skyloser,
past, present and future!

10:57.458 --> 10:59.083
Behold!

11:00.375 --> 11:02.250
Are you beholding?

11:02.333 --> 11:03.458
Oh, yes.

11:03.542 --> 11:07.042
-Do you know what this is?
-I don't know, The Book of Skylanders?

11:07.125 --> 11:08.875
You are crushing the guess work today.

11:08.958 --> 11:11.958
Every Skylander ever
is inscribed in the book,

11:12.042 --> 11:14.542
which binds their powers to it
for all eternity.

11:14.625 --> 11:18.250
So whoever controls the book
controls the Skylanders!

11:18.333 --> 11:19.375
See where I'm going with this?

11:19.458 --> 11:21.625
You intend to control the book.

11:21.708 --> 11:24.125
Wow, you are on fire today.
Or at least, you will be soon.

11:25.375 --> 11:28.958
Yes, I might have failed 314 times
to defeat those fools,

11:29.042 --> 11:32.667
but if I control that book,
I shall finally prevail.

11:32.750 --> 11:36.250
Right. Isn't the book hidden deep
in the bowels of the academy?

11:36.333 --> 11:39.042
Yes, except for one day a year...

11:39.125 --> 11:42.167
Skylander graduation day.

11:42.250 --> 11:45.833
Eon will have the book at the ceremony
to sketch the new Skylanders,

11:45.917 --> 11:47.625
and that's when I'll strike!

11:47.708 --> 11:50.083
Very good, sir.
Well plotted, sir.

11:50.167 --> 11:53.000
You know it, baby.
This calls for a celebration.

11:53.083 --> 11:55.417
I'm thinking something involving fire.

11:57.750 --> 11:59.792
Can't we just have cake?

12:01.625 --> 12:04.708
Uh... I'm ready to talk now.

12:04.792 --> 12:06.292
Mr. Kaos?

12:06.375 --> 12:08.292
Oh, hello?

12:11.875 --> 12:13.750
Yah!

12:18.875 --> 12:19.875
Ready, Elf?

12:27.167 --> 12:28.583
Go!

12:43.333 --> 12:45.250
Ooh!

12:45.333 --> 12:47.500
Yes! A new personal record.

12:47.583 --> 12:49.375
You know, Eruptor,

12:49.458 --> 12:52.583
it's been a lot of hard work getting here,
but I finally feel ready for the games.

12:52.667 --> 12:54.208
I'm just spit-balling here, Elfy,

12:54.292 --> 12:56.792
but why didn't you zip through the course
with your lightning speed

12:56.875 --> 12:59.542
to avoid these blade-y, kill-y things?

12:59.625 --> 13:01.250
Or not.

13:01.333 --> 13:04.625
I thought Spyro would be here
for a final practice. Where is he?

13:04.708 --> 13:05.750
I don't know.

13:05.833 --> 13:07.792
He said he had something
more important to do.

13:13.042 --> 13:15.750
Why are all these people
here at our house?

13:15.833 --> 13:18.375
Elf, are we being robbed...

13:18.458 --> 13:20.625
in a very festive manner?

13:20.708 --> 13:22.375
Food Fight!

13:22.458 --> 13:23.583
What is all this?

13:23.667 --> 13:26.750
Ha-ha. Duh!
Your graduation party.

13:26.833 --> 13:27.875
Um...

13:34.042 --> 13:36.417
No one gets in unless they're on the list.

13:36.500 --> 13:39.417
-Names?
-Names? You know us.

13:39.500 --> 13:41.917
We live here with Spyro.

13:42.000 --> 13:45.708
I don't make the rules,
I just enforce 'em, Eruptor.

13:45.792 --> 13:47.542
- Names?
- Eruptor! Elf!

13:47.625 --> 13:49.042
Welcome to the party.

13:49.125 --> 13:50.833
Party? What party?

13:50.917 --> 13:52.042
What, you didn't see the e-vite?

13:52.125 --> 13:55.417
-You gotta check your spam filter, bro.
-"Bro"?

13:55.500 --> 13:58.292
Cool, it's cool.
These two are with me.

13:58.375 --> 13:59.875
They're VIPs.

14:05.042 --> 14:08.042
You blew off our last practice
to throw a party?

14:09.375 --> 14:12.125
We need to be rested and ready
for the Skylander Games.

14:12.208 --> 14:14.083
You know, our final exam?

14:14.167 --> 14:15.375
Food fight!

14:18.375 --> 14:19.875
Bleh!

14:19.958 --> 14:22.333
See? There you go.
Now you're having fun.

14:22.417 --> 14:24.375
Just be ready for tomorrow.

14:24.458 --> 14:26.000
I was born ready.

14:26.083 --> 14:28.417
Now relax, guys,
and let's have some fun.

14:46.208 --> 14:48.250
Huh, Spyro's not out here either.

14:48.333 --> 14:50.208
-You checked his bedroom?
-Mmm-hmm.

14:50.292 --> 14:51.750
-The kitchen?
-Mmm-hmm.

14:51.833 --> 14:54.500
-Bathroom?
-We have a bathroom?

14:54.583 --> 14:56.292
Huh.

14:56.375 --> 14:57.708
Well, he must've gone to the games
ahead of us.

14:57.792 --> 15:01.667
There is no way
he'd miss the biggest day of his life.

15:26.750 --> 15:29.500
Welcome to your final test,

15:29.583 --> 15:33.792
your opportunity to prove you are worthy
of joining the protectors of our universe.

15:34.625 --> 15:38.917
By making it here, you have displayed
great dedication to the Skylands,

15:39.000 --> 15:40.542
and to each other.

15:42.833 --> 15:45.875
A dedication, clearly,
not everyone is capable of.

15:45.958 --> 15:47.250
Those of you who pass

15:47.333 --> 15:51.000
will join one of our teams of Skylanders
based at the academy,

15:51.083 --> 15:52.375
and with your colleagues,

15:52.458 --> 15:55.000
you will maintain the balance
and harmony of our world,

15:55.083 --> 15:58.583
fighting against the threat
of darkness and disorder.

15:58.667 --> 16:01.667
Without further ado,
let the games begin.

16:01.750 --> 16:04.458
First up... Eruptor.

16:20.417 --> 16:23.458
Sir, if you hate the Skylanders so much,
why are we here?

16:23.542 --> 16:26.042
I'm getting a lay of the land
for my attack.

16:26.125 --> 16:28.417
Plus, I need to know who to draft
for my Skylander fantasy league.

16:28.500 --> 16:31.750
I guess every supervillain
needs a pointless hobby.

16:31.833 --> 16:32.875
Ah!

16:32.958 --> 16:34.667
Don't judge me, Glumshanks.

16:34.750 --> 16:36.750
I don't mock
those little candies you collect.

16:36.833 --> 16:40.083
That's my anxiety medication, sir.

16:48.333 --> 16:51.292
It's spew-tiful!

16:51.375 --> 16:53.042
Eruptor, you're on fire!

16:53.125 --> 16:54.875
I know, right?

16:54.958 --> 16:57.750
No, I mean you are literally on fire!

16:57.833 --> 16:59.167
Oh! Oh, right.

16:59.250 --> 17:02.083
That happens sometimes.
No biggie.

17:02.167 --> 17:03.708
Well done, Eruptor.

17:03.792 --> 17:05.750
-On to stage two.
-Stage two?

17:05.833 --> 17:08.041
Choose a SuperCharger

17:08.125 --> 17:11.083
to navigate through
an obstacle course of threats.

17:11.166 --> 17:13.416
This ain't gonna end well.

17:14.375 --> 17:16.750
Vehicular assault was my worst class.

17:19.083 --> 17:20.708
Is this the seat belt button?

17:21.833 --> 17:22.916
Whoa!

17:25.250 --> 17:27.041
Concentrate on the threats!

17:27.125 --> 17:29.417
My ride is a threat. Oh!

17:32.417 --> 17:35.500
That does not look like me.
I am much taller!

17:50.042 --> 17:52.458
Oh, man.

17:52.542 --> 17:57.750
Nothing like a good night's sleep,
followed by a brisk horizontal shower.

18:00.542 --> 18:03.167
And now,
candidate four...

18:03.250 --> 18:05.875
-Hex!
-The Skylander Games!

18:10.083 --> 18:13.125
Well, that sucked.

18:13.208 --> 18:15.625
And finally, candidate five...

18:17.833 --> 18:19.125
absent.

18:20.250 --> 18:22.375
This concludes your final test,

18:22.458 --> 18:28.042
so I hereby declare these games
officially, 100% irrevocably--

18:28.125 --> 18:30.292
Hero incoming, hot and fast!

18:31.208 --> 18:33.667
Oh.
Hey, what's up, everybody?

18:33.750 --> 18:35.958
Looks like I made it
almost practically on time.

18:37.375 --> 18:38.500
Very well.

18:38.583 --> 18:42.000
Great, now let me just
stretch the ol' wings and then we can--

18:42.083 --> 18:43.542
Begin now!

19:22.167 --> 19:25.042
Yeah! That's what I'm talking about.

19:26.042 --> 19:29.625
Candidates, I will now call out
all of the names of those who have passed

19:29.708 --> 19:34.167
and will join me tomorrow
as the newest members of the Skylanders.

19:34.250 --> 19:35.292
Eruptor...

19:35.375 --> 19:37.125
-Pass.
-Yes!

19:37.208 --> 19:39.333
See you tomorrow at graduation.

19:39.417 --> 19:40.458
Bad Breath...

19:41.208 --> 19:43.375
-Pass.
-Oh, wow!

19:43.458 --> 19:45.583
I'm so happy...

19:51.167 --> 19:54.083
Sorry, feelings make me gassy.

19:54.167 --> 19:55.208
Hex...

19:55.292 --> 19:57.083
Fail.

19:57.167 --> 20:00.833
We lost out to a guy
whose superpower is burping.

20:00.917 --> 20:01.958
Burping!

20:02.042 --> 20:03.208
Stealth Elf...

20:03.833 --> 20:05.917
-Pass.
-Yes!

20:06.000 --> 20:07.125
And Spyro...

20:11.708 --> 20:12.750
Fail.

20:12.833 --> 20:13.917
Eon says what now?

20:14.000 --> 20:17.500
I warned you that your barely passing
would not be good enough

20:17.583 --> 20:19.292
to become a Skylander.

20:19.375 --> 20:20.667
And it isn't.

20:20.750 --> 20:22.833
So... you fail.

20:25.500 --> 20:26.917
I am sorry, Spyro,

20:27.000 --> 20:31.125
but you will not enter
The Book of Skylanders this year.

20:31.208 --> 20:36.167
I truly hope one day
you will earn your place among us.

20:56.917 --> 20:59.875
Okay, universe, I get the point!

21:09.958 --> 21:11.917
Oh! Ooh...

21:28.417 --> 21:31.000
Elf, are you trying to end me?

21:32.042 --> 21:33.750
Spyro's still in his room?

21:33.833 --> 21:36.250
I know he feels bad,
but he can't stay up there forever.

21:36.333 --> 21:39.000
Well, a couple of months
might do some good.

21:39.083 --> 21:40.667
I'm just saying,

21:40.750 --> 21:43.542
maybe this is what it takes for him
to finally learn his lesson.

21:43.625 --> 21:46.667
A never-ending pity party
isn't going to help.

21:46.750 --> 21:49.208
I'm gonna go check in
to see if he's doing okay.

21:50.292 --> 21:51.792
Roadie pancake!

21:54.833 --> 21:57.792
This is why
we cannot have nice things!

21:58.958 --> 22:02.292
- Spyro?
- Up high.

22:02.375 --> 22:04.000
What are you doing?

22:04.083 --> 22:07.125
- Oh, you know...
- wallowing.

22:07.208 --> 22:10.333
Well, can you wallow your way down here
to talk to me for a minute?

22:10.417 --> 22:12.125
Then you can go back
to feeling sorry for yourself.

22:14.500 --> 22:17.208
Look, just because
you're not becoming a Skylander today,

22:17.292 --> 22:19.333
doesn't mean it won't ever happen.

22:19.417 --> 22:22.292
You are still the guy with the highest
admission scores ever, you know.

22:23.125 --> 22:25.333
I know, I know, it's just...

22:25.417 --> 22:27.917
I guess I thought that everything would
always come easy to me.

22:28.000 --> 22:30.875
I let everybody down and it stinks.

22:30.958 --> 22:34.583
Well, no time like the present
to start making up for your mistakes.

22:34.667 --> 22:36.875
But the first thing you've got to do
is to get out of this room.

22:36.958 --> 22:39.000
You'll never be the hero
we all know you can be

22:39.083 --> 22:40.458
by staring at the floor all day.

22:40.542 --> 22:43.500
You, um... really think I'm a hero?

22:44.833 --> 22:47.250
Want to know what I really think?

22:56.292 --> 22:57.958
We did it, Elfy.

22:58.042 --> 23:01.000
We really made it.

23:03.208 --> 23:06.042
Sorry, nervousness makes me gassy.

23:06.125 --> 23:08.375
Everything makes you gassy.

23:08.458 --> 23:10.917
Citizens of Skylands,

23:11.000 --> 23:14.375
- it is my distinct pleasure...
- and contractual obligation...

23:14.458 --> 23:15.958
to welcome you!

23:20.750 --> 23:24.167
These costumes were a great idea,
hmm, Glumshanks?

23:24.250 --> 23:27.458
I'm surprisingly comfortable in mine, sir.

23:27.542 --> 23:29.458
Good.

23:29.542 --> 23:33.125
Now let's make our way
inconspicuously towards the stage.

23:33.208 --> 23:36.667
Oh, just move! Out of my way!

23:40.125 --> 23:41.708
Stupid pancakes.

23:49.667 --> 23:51.000
What a jerk I've been.

23:51.083 --> 23:55.208
What a stupid, handsome jerk.

23:55.292 --> 23:57.875
You know what?
Elf... Elf's right.

23:57.958 --> 24:00.708
It's time to stop
feeling sorry for myself.

24:00.792 --> 24:04.375
I'm gonna go to that graduation,
and I'm gonna support my friends.

24:07.125 --> 24:10.375
And now I shall begin expertly sketching

24:10.458 --> 24:13.708
our newest members
into The Book of Skylanders.

24:14.833 --> 24:16.375
-Eruptor, look!
-Oh?

24:24.458 --> 24:26.792
Hey, look!
Huh, what do you think?

24:27.792 --> 24:30.625
Hugo, the book, please.

24:41.167 --> 24:43.708
Is it time to steal the book, sir?

24:43.792 --> 24:46.000
Don't get your bonnet in a twist,
Glumshanks!

24:46.083 --> 24:48.542
We have to wait
until all of the Skylanders are drawn

24:48.625 --> 24:50.958
so I can destroy every one of them.

24:51.042 --> 24:53.375
With that final stroke,

24:53.458 --> 24:56.417
the Skylanders team
welcomes our newest members...

24:56.500 --> 24:57.708
Eruptor...

24:58.208 --> 24:59.792
Stealth Elf...

24:59.875 --> 25:02.083
and... Bad Breath.

25:03.292 --> 25:06.042
Whoo-hoo! Eruptor! Elf! Yeah!

25:07.250 --> 25:09.625
Hugo, return this to the vault.

25:09.708 --> 25:12.083
Yes, sir!
Nothing in the Skylands

25:12.167 --> 25:15.833
could prevent me from completing
a mission of such utmost importance--

25:17.708 --> 25:21.875
Glumshanks, it is time! Reveal me!

25:30.625 --> 25:33.625
-Kaos?
-You bet your sweet beard!

25:33.708 --> 25:37.917
And now, the all-powerful
Book of Skylanders is mine! Mine.

25:38.000 --> 25:42.042
I've been dreaming of this moment
all my week!

25:50.833 --> 25:53.125
Now that I have your precious book,

25:53.208 --> 25:59.417
I finally have the ultimate control I need
to end every one of you Skyjerks!

25:59.500 --> 26:04.292
Skylanders, we must get the book back!
Our very lives depend on it!

26:04.375 --> 26:06.417
-Attack!
-Ah!

26:06.500 --> 26:08.833
Well, well,
if it isn't the original angry bird.

26:08.917 --> 26:10.833
-Ah!
-Oh!

26:10.917 --> 26:13.042
Good grief, for the love of...

26:17.208 --> 26:19.708
Two parts this one,
one part that one.

26:20.458 --> 26:21.625
A-ha, there you are!

26:23.250 --> 26:25.833
He's scrunching me!

26:26.833 --> 26:29.625
One of the new Skyjerks, eh?

26:29.708 --> 26:31.833
-Get a load of this!
-Uh...

26:31.917 --> 26:35.500
You're going to attack me
with outdated office supplies?

26:36.292 --> 26:39.083
Ow, ow, ow.

26:39.167 --> 26:41.208
Oh! Oh! Ow!

26:41.292 --> 26:43.417
Ow, ow, ow! What the...

26:47.250 --> 26:48.833
No!

26:53.917 --> 26:57.292
Glummy, you took a belch for me?

26:58.625 --> 27:01.208
Oh, great,
now that smell is in your costume.

27:01.292 --> 27:03.208
I'll never get my deposit back.

27:03.292 --> 27:06.375
Kaos can't defend
against all of us at once, Skylanders!

27:06.458 --> 27:07.500
Oh, really?

27:08.083 --> 27:11.625
Stay back or I'll burn the book,
and all of you with it.

27:11.708 --> 27:12.750
You dolt.

27:12.833 --> 27:15.500
The book is too mighty
to succumb to fire.

27:15.583 --> 27:18.583
It is a powerful relic
that can never be burned!

27:18.667 --> 27:20.708
Huh. Can it be frozen?

27:20.792 --> 27:22.833
Uh... no comment?

27:38.458 --> 27:40.625
I'm a good friend.
A real good friend.

27:40.708 --> 27:43.208
Being supportive.
Sacrificing my time.

27:43.292 --> 27:46.208
Eating this churro
in a very supportive way.

27:46.292 --> 27:47.958
Huh?

27:51.875 --> 27:53.375
Hey! What's happening?

27:53.458 --> 27:55.708
Kaos is attacking the Skylanders!

27:55.792 --> 27:59.083
What? Hold on,
what I meant was...

27:59.167 --> 28:00.167
What?

28:00.250 --> 28:03.000
Oh, that's much better.
That really conveys the urgency.

28:04.625 --> 28:07.667
Well, this has been way too much fun.

28:07.750 --> 28:11.458
Look at all these frozen,
defenseless losers.

28:11.542 --> 28:14.333
You know, it's really nice
to be the one with all the power

28:14.417 --> 28:16.625
and wield it dangerously for once.

28:16.708 --> 28:19.500
This has been
some first class wielding, sir.

28:19.583 --> 28:22.958
You could write a how-to manual
on the subject of... of wielding.

28:23.042 --> 28:24.542
I already have!

28:25.750 --> 28:29.708
Before you start marking the calendar
for your inevitable book tour, sir...

28:29.792 --> 28:32.333
shouldn't you get back to destroying
The Book of Skylanders

28:32.417 --> 28:33.750
and all of them with it?

28:33.833 --> 28:35.750
Glumshanks, don't rush me!

28:35.833 --> 28:37.917
It's been a long time
since I've had a good gloat.

28:38.000 --> 28:39.750
Gloat with me, Glumshanks.

28:39.833 --> 28:41.708
-Ah...
-Gloat harder!

29:05.667 --> 29:09.042
Eruptor, can't you spew lava
to free yourself?

29:09.125 --> 29:12.333
I'm trying!

29:17.958 --> 29:21.250
Hey, guys, guys, guys.
I can't see. Is it working?

29:21.333 --> 29:23.792
Hey, guys.
Guys, it's me!

29:23.875 --> 29:25.958
- Spyro.
- Yeah, we know who you are.

29:26.042 --> 29:28.333
Kaos put some sort of
freeze spell on us.

29:28.417 --> 29:29.875
Aren't you feeling it, too?

29:29.958 --> 29:31.958
Nope, I'm balmy.
It's balmy.

29:32.042 --> 29:34.333
It's kind of balmy.
It's a little too hot.

29:34.417 --> 29:36.125
It's actually quite a nice day
for a graduation.

29:36.208 --> 29:38.917
Uh, pollen count's a little high, but...
Wait a second!

29:39.000 --> 29:41.917
Kaos put a spell on the book
and I'm not in it!

29:42.000 --> 29:43.500
He has no power over me.

29:43.583 --> 29:44.875
Then go.
Save yourself.

29:44.958 --> 29:46.500
No, no way.

29:46.583 --> 29:48.625
If there's one thing I've learned
the past couple days,

29:49.333 --> 29:51.917
it's that heroes
can't just think of themselves.

29:52.000 --> 29:54.000
They have to sacrifice
to be part of a team.

29:56.208 --> 29:58.250
Huh?

29:58.750 --> 30:01.000
- Yo! Pumpkin Head!
- Pumpkin Head?

30:01.083 --> 30:02.375
No one calls me that!

30:02.458 --> 30:04.417
What?
Everybody calls you that!

30:04.500 --> 30:08.000
Also Cantaloupe Kid, Melon Skull,
Steve, Señor Cabeza Grande--

30:08.083 --> 30:09.625
Steve? What does that even mean?

30:09.708 --> 30:11.958
I have no idea.
I assumed it was short for Steven.

30:12.042 --> 30:14.417
But what I do know is
you won't get away with this.

30:14.500 --> 30:17.208
Sure I will.
I'm, like, 98% done already.

30:17.292 --> 30:20.708
Actually, I was just about to head out.
Come, Glumshanks!

30:20.792 --> 30:24.125
So the waiter says, "Sure I can open it,
but there's a corkage fee."

30:24.208 --> 30:26.125
And I'm all like, "Corkage fee?

30:26.208 --> 30:28.542
Ha! I'll show you
what to do with your corkage fee."

30:28.625 --> 30:29.875
-Glumshanks!
-Ah!

30:29.958 --> 30:32.083
Ugh, again with the corkage fee?

30:34.750 --> 30:36.625
You're not going anywhere, Steve!

30:36.708 --> 30:38.750
Who's going to stop me? You?

30:38.833 --> 30:41.208
You're not frozen,
which means you're not in this book.

30:41.292 --> 30:45.750
No book means no Skylander,
which means you're nobody.

30:45.833 --> 30:47.500
You're right, I'm not a Skylander.

30:47.583 --> 30:49.458
But I can still stop you.

31:40.000 --> 31:42.583
Now who's the Steve? Huh?

31:51.958 --> 31:53.708
Come, Glumshanks.

31:53.792 --> 31:56.292
As long as I continue
to cast my freezing spell

31:56.375 --> 32:00.292
over their all-powerful book,
the Skydorks will remain stuck here.

32:00.375 --> 32:03.167
Let's go toilet paper their library,
then destroy the world.

32:03.750 --> 32:04.750
Oops!

32:06.042 --> 32:07.292
One last thing.

32:09.417 --> 32:12.708
Not my beard!

32:16.208 --> 32:18.958
Here, I got you a beardsicle.

32:19.042 --> 32:21.167
Uh, good one, sir.

32:21.250 --> 32:22.500
Seriously! Take it!

32:41.042 --> 32:42.708
Spyro!

32:42.792 --> 32:46.625
You must wake up.
The fate of the Skylands depends on it!

32:46.708 --> 32:47.875
Wake up.

32:48.708 --> 32:49.833
Wake up!

32:50.833 --> 32:52.417
Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up.

32:53.500 --> 32:55.833
Hurry, Skylander!

33:00.042 --> 33:04.458
Petty vandalism is chicken soup
for the evil soul.

33:04.542 --> 33:06.292
Now what was I going to do next?

33:06.375 --> 33:09.583
Right, destroy the world.
Starting with this book.

33:22.833 --> 33:25.375
Hand me that bust of Eon, Glummy.

33:27.000 --> 33:28.167
Whoa!

33:28.250 --> 33:30.250
Some sort of single bookcase vault.

33:32.333 --> 33:34.208
Ooh, a double bookcase vault!

33:38.375 --> 33:39.583
Ah!

33:41.167 --> 33:43.750
Facial hair not recognized.

33:43.833 --> 33:44.833
Huh?

33:46.083 --> 33:49.042
Glumshanks, stop gobbling that beard
and fork it over!

33:53.083 --> 33:56.375
Disgustingly moist facial hair identified.

33:56.458 --> 33:59.000
Welcome, Master Eon.

34:07.000 --> 34:08.792
I was kinda hoping for another bookcase.

34:29.542 --> 34:32.500
Ha! How's that for fire safety?

34:37.708 --> 34:40.917
Glum-dog,
how much bling is too much bling?

34:41.000 --> 34:43.292
One can never have too much bling, sir.

34:44.333 --> 34:46.500
Hmm, bling indeed...

34:46.583 --> 34:47.625
Oh...

34:47.708 --> 34:50.625
My, what have we here?

34:52.042 --> 34:53.042
Whoa!

34:53.125 --> 34:54.292
Ha!

34:59.250 --> 35:03.167
-Who's there?
-It's me... Nobody.

35:03.250 --> 35:05.458
But you can call me Spyro.

35:05.542 --> 35:06.792
You again?

35:25.708 --> 35:27.875
And now to destroy the book.

35:42.583 --> 35:45.417
Eon was right.
Never gets old.

35:45.500 --> 35:46.500
Ha!

35:47.250 --> 35:49.250
No one electrocutes Kaos, boy!

35:52.792 --> 35:56.875
About to be eliminated
by the very book you're trying to save.

35:56.958 --> 35:58.708
Ironic, hmm?

35:59.458 --> 36:00.625
Glumshanks, is that irony?

36:00.708 --> 36:03.667
I try to avoid the word irony, sir,

36:03.750 --> 36:05.708
on account of
nobody knows what it means.

36:06.542 --> 36:07.542
But it's close enough.

36:07.625 --> 36:09.125
Excellent!

36:09.208 --> 36:12.292
At least you learned one lesson
before your end.

36:12.375 --> 36:15.875
You're not strong enough
to beat me on your own.

36:15.958 --> 36:18.333
You're right. I'm not.

36:24.167 --> 36:27.167
Hot, hot, hot book!
Hot book! Hoo-yah!

36:39.083 --> 36:40.250
Oh...

36:40.333 --> 36:42.500
All right, Plan B, Glummy.

36:42.583 --> 36:46.208
Let's bury him alive until he talks.

36:54.708 --> 36:55.542
Eh?

36:57.583 --> 36:59.583
Now that you've seen the library,

36:59.667 --> 37:02.708
how about an aerial tour
of the rest of the academy?

37:02.792 --> 37:07.375
In hindsight, maybe you should've
re-frozen that book, sir.

37:20.458 --> 37:23.250
We're alive, Glumshanks! Alive!

37:28.792 --> 37:30.417
Not good.

37:33.333 --> 37:35.875
Spyro... are you all right?

37:35.958 --> 37:39.083
Uh, no, can't say that I am.

37:39.167 --> 37:42.292
I'm actually in
a staggering amount of pain.

37:42.375 --> 37:47.417
Yes... we've all suffered
terrible losses today.

37:47.500 --> 37:48.750
You know, Master Eon,

37:48.833 --> 37:51.375
this entire experience
has taught me so much.

37:51.458 --> 37:55.250
And I want you to know
that I'll be ready to go next year.

37:56.042 --> 37:59.750
I think you're ready now, Spyro.

38:01.042 --> 38:05.000
When you were in the bubble
and I called you Skylander, I meant it.

38:05.083 --> 38:09.458
I knew you could rise to the occasion
and prove yourself worthy.

38:09.542 --> 38:12.875
You have honored us all
by finding your balance

38:12.958 --> 38:16.125
in the form of
selfless heroism and sacrifice.

38:17.250 --> 38:18.917
Thank you, Eon.

38:19.000 --> 38:21.333
Now, are you getting my good side?

38:21.417 --> 38:24.250
You're right, who am I kidding?
They're both my good side.

38:24.333 --> 38:25.625
Really, dude? Really?

38:25.708 --> 38:29.167
You're totally right.
It doesn't matter what I look like.

38:29.250 --> 38:32.542
-Character growth, huh?
-Skylanders...

38:33.125 --> 38:35.458
meet your newest teammate.

38:40.167 --> 38:43.125
Uh... hmm.

38:43.208 --> 38:45.875
Don't worry, I always fix them.
Just humor him.

38:49.333 --> 38:51.792
Thanks, guys.
I owe you big time.

38:51.875 --> 38:54.125
- Oh, yeah, you do.
- What he said.

38:54.208 --> 38:55.583
Now don't screw this up!

38:55.667 --> 38:57.167
Hey, what about Bad Breath?

38:57.250 --> 39:00.500
He got so scared when Kaos attacked
that he couldn't stop burping.

39:00.583 --> 39:03.125
Then he felt bad about that
and he started crying.

39:03.208 --> 39:05.542
Burping, crying,
crying, crying, burping.

39:05.625 --> 39:07.958
That kid is an emotional wafer cookie.

39:08.042 --> 39:10.583
Yes, uh... Bad Breath will be
spending some time

39:10.667 --> 39:13.792
working on his...
gastrointestinal stability

39:13.875 --> 39:16.250
before he re-joins the team.

39:16.333 --> 39:20.042
Now then,
you are all full-fledged Skylanders

39:20.125 --> 39:23.917
and will soon share grand adventures
on important missions

39:24.000 --> 39:25.833
in service of the academy.

39:25.917 --> 39:28.958
But for now,
enjoy your accomplishments.

39:29.042 --> 39:30.750
And please...

39:30.833 --> 39:32.750
no parties.

39:32.833 --> 39:33.833
Copy that.

39:34.875 --> 39:36.625
Fewer parties.

39:39.167 --> 39:41.250
Whoo!

39:42.000 --> 39:43.917
Yes!

39:44.000 --> 39:45.917
Whoo-hoo! Whoo! Whoo!

39:46.750 --> 39:48.250
Ha-ha!

39:51.125 --> 39:53.083
Perhaps it's not my place
to point it out, sir,

39:53.167 --> 39:55.708
but you have a rather disturbing...

39:55.792 --> 39:58.000
rash going on here in the back.

39:58.083 --> 39:59.750
I might have some ointment.

40:00.750 --> 40:02.542
Some salve, perhaps.

40:04.250 --> 40:08.583
I could, uh, put you in touch with a...
uh... very good dermatologist.

40:08.667 --> 40:10.583
-Fellow by the name of--
-Glumshanks!

40:10.667 --> 40:13.833
Well, sir, I guess
it just wasn't meant to be this time.

40:13.917 --> 40:17.958
Only because something greater
is meant to be, Glumshanks.

40:18.042 --> 40:21.167
A discovery which will
not only end the Skylosers,

40:21.250 --> 40:23.500
but all of the Skylands!

40:23.583 --> 40:25.250
Behold!

40:26.500 --> 40:28.875
- Are you--
- I'm beholding.

40:28.958 --> 40:32.917
Inside the vault, I found the location of
the most important place in the Skylands,

40:33.000 --> 40:35.833
where light and dark meet
in perfect harmony!

40:35.917 --> 40:37.917
A black and white cookie
from Lou's Deli?

40:38.000 --> 40:39.583
No, dummy, the Core of Light!

40:39.667 --> 40:43.083
The hub of all balance and peace
in this cursed universe!

40:43.167 --> 40:45.333
And now that I know where it is,
I will destroy it

40:45.417 --> 40:48.042
and unleash darkness
on the Skylands forever.

40:48.125 --> 40:50.250
Oh, I didn't need to see that.

40:50.333 --> 40:52.250
End of times.
Reign of darkness.

40:52.333 --> 40:55.542
Very good, Steve.
Uh, I mean... uh, I mean, sir.
