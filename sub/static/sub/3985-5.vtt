WEBVTT

00:08.475 --> 00:10.466
See, to cap a motherfucker,

00:10.510 --> 00:12.501
you put a pistol to his head,
say, "pow," and he tagged.

00:12.545 --> 00:15.070
- But when Chris and them do it...
- Yo, it ain't working, Na'.

00:15.115 --> 00:18.812
- I know you making this up.
- Word to my mother, yo. Lex ain't dead.

00:18.852 --> 00:21.685
I seen him creeping in an alley
last night near the playground.

00:21.721 --> 00:23.348
Everybody know Lex is dead.

00:23.390 --> 00:25.950
Nah, there's dead,
and there's special dead.

00:25.992 --> 00:28.256
Yeah, Chris working
that juju shit.

00:28.294 --> 00:30.660
Nah, man, what I'm saying
is they zombies.

00:30.697 --> 00:34.258
Why you think he take them into vacants?
He need time to change them.

00:34.300 --> 00:36.825
You don't believe me,
yo, it's on you.

00:36.870 --> 00:38.428
Yo, they funnin',
ain't they, Michael?

00:38.471 --> 00:40.598
I don't know about
that voodoo shit, man, but Chris

00:40.640 --> 00:44.098
is definitely doing something...
get a nigger to walk up in there

00:44.144 --> 00:45.907
knowing he about
to get capped, man.

00:45.945 --> 00:48.743
Chris, he different. You can tell
by them coon-ass country clothes

00:48.782 --> 00:50.977
that nigger be wearing.

00:51.017 --> 00:53.383
Nine?

00:53.420 --> 00:55.786
Nah, too much bark.

00:55.822 --> 00:57.084
Probably a.40-cal.

00:58.825 --> 01:00.725
Yeah, man,
this is serious business.

01:00.760 --> 01:02.523
So you saying
Lex is a zombie?

01:02.562 --> 01:04.962
Pookie, Byron,
all them niggers.

01:04.998 --> 01:07.831
- And Chris?
- Yeah, Chris... Zombie Master.

01:09.269 --> 01:11.134
I knew this
wasn't going away.

01:11.171 --> 01:14.197
That's what we've been trying
to tell you, yo. Chris got the power.

01:14.240 --> 01:16.003
He tell them to come,
and they gotta come...

01:16.042 --> 01:18.442
like the devil do
with the damned.

01:18.478 --> 01:19.945
What you think
Chris got them doing?

01:20.980 --> 01:23.244
They're probably
spies, man.

01:23.283 --> 01:25.808
Can't figure any other way
Marlo knows so much.

01:25.852 --> 01:29.185
Yeah, that's what it is. Like in this
movie, "Zombie Killer" or something.

01:29.222 --> 01:31.122
They came out at night, hunting.

01:31.157 --> 01:33.057
- Hunting?
- Yeah, man. They...

01:37.797 --> 01:40.357
Yeah, and in that movie they was
snatching people up,

01:40.400 --> 01:42.425
stealing their warmth.

01:44.000 --> 01:50.074

St. Jude, patron

03:54.367 --> 03:56.665
Tell me you ain't
been on bended knee

03:56.703 --> 03:59.365
whispering in his saintly ear
each and every night

03:59.405 --> 04:00.997
before you close
those peepers.

04:01.040 --> 04:04.009
I know you have, Tommy,
catch a break like this.

04:05.044 --> 04:06.136
Stan, you're sure
about this?

04:06.179 --> 04:07.771
On my mother's soul.
It's a lock.

04:07.814 --> 04:09.873
Assigned a rookie...
a broad, no less...

04:09.916 --> 04:11.850
as lead detective.

04:11.884 --> 04:13.476
Pulled a good man off,
too, I heard.

04:13.519 --> 04:16.113
Hmm. Tom.

04:16.154 --> 04:18.851
Tommy, remember...

04:18.891 --> 04:21.291
anything you need.

04:25.732 --> 04:27.597
He's a piece of work.

04:27.634 --> 04:29.966
Valchek?
Comes with the territory.

04:30.003 --> 04:31.766
You want the First District
council seat,

04:31.804 --> 04:33.863
you make nice with whatever Polish
or Greek commander

04:33.906 --> 04:36.670
- they dump in the southeast.
- Not Italian.

04:36.709 --> 04:38.176
No, there ain't enough of us left
down there.

04:38.211 --> 04:40.805
- You think he has this right?
- That Royce tampered with the case?

04:40.847 --> 04:43.213
No way the mayor knows.

04:43.249 --> 04:45.683
You're right. This one has Ervin Burrell
written all over it.

04:45.718 --> 04:47.686
Fuck if the mayor knows or not.
If it's true,

04:47.720 --> 04:49.347
we get it out there quick
and bang him hard.

04:49.389 --> 04:51.414
- I go public?
- They can't spin this.

04:51.457 --> 04:53.516
They sabotaged
a criminal case.

04:53.559 --> 04:57.120
No spin on a knuckleball, you still
can't tell how it's gonna break.

05:03.536 --> 05:07.472
We feed it to Tony Gray. We keep
ourselves out of the line of fire,

05:07.507 --> 05:09.941
sting Royce,
and as an added bonus,

05:09.976 --> 05:11.603
give Gray's campaign
a boost

05:11.644 --> 05:14.374
which comes at the expense
of the mayor's base.

05:17.750 --> 05:21.413
I'm a devious motherfucker
once I get going.

05:21.454 --> 05:23.081
So all told,

05:23.122 --> 05:25.989
we're looking at 13 warrants
and six locations.

05:26.025 --> 05:28.550
And given my staffing
situation...

05:28.594 --> 05:30.459
Not a problem.

05:30.496 --> 05:33.397
I can give you my D.E.U.,
Flex, and Ops squads.

05:33.433 --> 05:35.799
- A sector of uniforms if you need it.
- Great.

05:35.835 --> 05:39.430
The problem is, you're wasting a wiretap
on street-level arrests.

05:39.472 --> 05:41.497
We do these raids right,
we might catch Marlo

05:41.541 --> 05:43.907
or one of his lieutenants
at one of these locations,

05:43.943 --> 05:46.241
- get them with dope on the table.
- Marlo Stanfield...

05:46.279 --> 05:48.770
in a room,
with dope on the table?

05:48.815 --> 05:52.307
I've kicked down doors
and surprised bigger players than him.

05:52.352 --> 05:54.047
Well, let me warn you,
Lieutenant...

05:54.087 --> 05:56.487
I am not about
to litigate a wiretap

05:56.522 --> 05:58.149
for a handful
of street rips.

05:58.191 --> 06:01.285
Well... that's on you,
Counselor.

06:01.327 --> 06:03.318
No, it's not.

06:03.363 --> 06:05.923
Major, see you tomorrow.

06:13.639 --> 06:16.802
Floaters...
you had any more?

06:16.843 --> 06:19.505
- No more than usual for the season.
- What about decomps?

06:19.545 --> 06:21.206
What do you got
in the decomp room?

06:21.247 --> 06:23.442
- Two or three unidentifieds.
- Found in Baltimore?

06:23.483 --> 06:25.144
No. Actually,
two from Prince George's,

06:25.184 --> 06:27.209
- one from Dorchester.
- Nah, he wouldn't drive that far.

06:27.253 --> 06:28.777
Let me get
this straight:

06:28.821 --> 06:31.119
You're looking for extra bodies,
no one in particular,

06:31.157 --> 06:33.785
other than this one kid you already
put out on the teletype.

06:33.826 --> 06:35.623
Yeah. You on it.

06:35.661 --> 06:37.754
You fellas
don't have enough work?

06:40.166 --> 06:42.566
If you do your classwork,
homework,

06:42.602 --> 06:44.229
you earn stickers.

06:44.270 --> 06:47.000
Dag, yo, every day
you be changing it up.

06:47.039 --> 06:49.769
You got us confused, Mr. P.

06:49.809 --> 06:52.835
Behave in class,
that's another sticker.

06:52.879 --> 06:57.339
At the end of the week, the four
with the most stickers get a prize

06:57.383 --> 07:00.750
and are eligible for a grand drawing
at the end of the month.

07:00.787 --> 07:03.551
Don't do your work,

07:03.589 --> 07:05.523
misbehave in class...

07:07.693 --> 07:10.161
...your name goes here.

07:10.196 --> 07:14.030
Detention... a full hour after school,
no exceptions.

07:14.066 --> 07:17.001
So it's up to you...
stickers for prizes

07:17.036 --> 07:19.698
or stay with me
after school.

07:19.739 --> 07:22.003
Yo, Mr. P., why you do me
detention, huh?

07:22.041 --> 07:23.736
You interrupted
the class, Namond.

07:23.776 --> 07:26.768
Yo, when you first came in here,
you was all treating us straight up,

07:26.813 --> 07:29.145
and now you just dog me
before I even know the rules.

07:29.182 --> 07:31.173
That ain't right, man.

07:36.422 --> 07:39.755
When you're right, Namond,
you're right.

07:39.792 --> 07:42.124
Hey, Mr. P., I want me
some of them stickers.

07:42.161 --> 07:44.288
Zenobia,
you have to do your work.

07:44.330 --> 07:47.595
I want to,
but I ain't got no pencils.

07:53.940 --> 07:57.137
I don't want
no damn welfare pencil!

08:10.756 --> 08:12.917
It seems to me

08:12.959 --> 08:15.655
there are two kinds of kids
walking in this building...

08:15.695 --> 08:18.425
stoop kids
and corner kids.

08:18.464 --> 08:20.398
- Excuse me?
- You know, stoop kids

08:20.433 --> 08:23.027
stay on their front steps
when their parents tell them.

08:23.069 --> 08:24.764
The others go down
to the corners.

08:24.804 --> 08:27.898
They can't sit still in the class.
The others can and do.

08:27.940 --> 08:30.932
- So separate the two.
- That's tracking.

08:30.977 --> 08:33.376
- Excuse me?
- Tracking students.

08:33.412 --> 08:35.607
It's a nasty phrase
in educational circles.

08:35.648 --> 08:38.674
It refers to the grouping of children
based on expected performance.

08:38.717 --> 08:41.744
- What's wrong with it?
- It says you have reduced expectations

08:41.787 --> 08:45.314
for certain students, that you expect
less from them academically.

08:46.626 --> 08:48.423
So you pretend
to teach all these kids,

08:48.461 --> 08:50.452
and the truth is,
you ain't teaching any of them.

08:50.496 --> 08:52.293
But what if
the stoop kids

08:52.331 --> 08:54.595
could be in classrooms
where there was no disruptions?

08:54.634 --> 08:56.727
- And the corner kids?
- They're the ones you're after, right?

08:56.769 --> 08:58.498
That's why you got
the grant money.

08:58.538 --> 09:01.132
As long as this doesn't involve
warehousing children,

09:01.173 --> 09:03.437
I'm for anything that
allows me to do my job.

09:03.476 --> 09:05.535
Every teacher here
will tell you the same.

09:05.578 --> 09:08.046
The trick for you is
to come up with a program

09:08.080 --> 09:10.344
that actually addresses itself
to the corner kids.

09:10.383 --> 09:13.716
We start pulling kids out of regular
classes... won't they be stigmatized?

09:13.753 --> 09:16.449
There's not a stigma in being
booted out of class every other day?

09:16.489 --> 09:18.252
Question is,

09:18.291 --> 09:20.088
how do we identify
the corner kids?

09:20.126 --> 09:21.593
That won't be a problem.

09:23.162 --> 09:26.131
Okay. Okay.

09:34.740 --> 09:36.605
You understand the work?

09:39.812 --> 09:42.713
Come on, this is easy.
I know you can do it.

09:47.420 --> 09:50.514
You're not giving me a choice.
You have detention.

09:50.556 --> 09:52.820
Yo, Na', Mrs. D.
Shaking bushes.

09:53.926 --> 09:56.224
Back to your seats.

09:57.697 --> 09:59.631
What the fuck?
She got my blade, yo.

09:59.665 --> 10:01.690
I said,
"Back to your seats."

10:08.574 --> 10:10.667
Yo, Mrs. D. Be stealing shit.

10:10.710 --> 10:12.940
I ain't never gonna
get my blade back.

10:15.481 --> 10:18.211
Yo, what are you all up on me for?
I do my work.

10:18.250 --> 10:21.151
I'm not your yo.
Show me your work.

10:26.225 --> 10:28.955
Yeah, I see.

10:28.995 --> 10:31.327
Yo, my hand hurting from all this
learning. You got some Tylenol?

10:33.165 --> 10:35.065
What I got for you
is detention.

10:35.101 --> 10:36.830
Oh-hh!

10:36.869 --> 10:39.667
- You know what? Fuck you, Prezbo.
- Oh-hh!

10:39.705 --> 10:41.900
Fucking gimpy-assed,
big-grill motherfucker.

10:41.941 --> 10:43.772
That's it.
You're out of here!

10:46.712 --> 10:48.373
Go!

10:56.288 --> 10:58.882
Get your police stick
out your desk and beat me.

10:58.924 --> 11:03.793
- You know you fucking want to.
- Oh-hh.

11:05.264 --> 11:07.061
Everyone, back in your seat.

11:07.099 --> 11:09.090
The fuck you
looking at, bitch?

11:10.269 --> 11:12.237
Oh-hh, Ms. Sampson, l...

11:12.271 --> 11:15.138
Namond Brice, if you weren't headed
to the main office,

11:15.174 --> 11:17.904
- you are now.
- Yeah, I was just...

11:21.147 --> 11:24.116
One of the corner
kids, huh?

11:24.150 --> 11:26.744
Yeah, they do step up
when you need them, don't they?

11:26.786 --> 11:30.688
Look, what? You want me to say
you right? You right.

11:30.723 --> 11:33.089
I should have had protection
at the card game.

11:33.125 --> 11:34.683
Done is done.

11:34.727 --> 11:36.695
Now we need to decide what we're
gonna do about Omar.

11:36.729 --> 11:38.219
You make the price right,

11:38.264 --> 11:41.631
somebody gonna get a whiff of that
bushwhacker's ass.

11:41.667 --> 11:43.931
Now you take it
from there.

11:43.969 --> 11:45.698
You think so?

11:45.738 --> 11:49.265
I ain't saying Omar can't be got.
Any nigger can be got.

11:49.308 --> 11:50.935
But once we put
word to ear

11:50.976 --> 11:52.739
and he learn that
we pricing out his head,

11:52.778 --> 11:54.803
he's gonna be trying us
like we're trying him.

11:56.248 --> 11:58.910
- You saying I should let it slide?
- Nah.

11:58.951 --> 12:01.977
Nah, we get at him
another way,

12:02.021 --> 12:04.683
get at him without no bounties,
no bullshit like that.

12:04.724 --> 12:07.249
Barksdale turned this town upside down
hunting him,

12:07.293 --> 12:09.261
and all he ended up looking
was weak.

12:09.295 --> 12:10.455
I ain't no Barksdale.

12:10.496 --> 12:12.987
I'm just saying
talk is cheap.

12:13.032 --> 12:15.830
We sit on it, we gonna figure out a way
to get that faggot.

12:15.868 --> 12:19.804
But till then we don't
say a mumbling word.

12:25.544 --> 12:29.207
I got me six now, and I'll give you
the four later, all right? Come on!

12:29.248 --> 12:31.808
- Nah. I'm gonna need the whole 10 now.
- Sherrod!

12:33.719 --> 12:36.620
- You ain't in school?
- I'm half a day... teachers' meeting.

12:36.655 --> 12:39.089
Come on, I told you about
those lame excuses, man.

12:39.125 --> 12:42.117
- I was talking to him first.
- Ain't no need for physical contact...

12:42.161 --> 12:43.753
You got $4 for me?
I'm short $4.

12:43.796 --> 12:46.424
What the fuck
are you talking...

12:46.465 --> 12:49.025
Got a cart full of shit, nigger.
What you got for me?

12:49.068 --> 12:51.002
I know you holding.

12:51.036 --> 12:52.936
Where's it at?
You ain't hear?

12:52.972 --> 12:54.303
Okay.

12:54.340 --> 12:57.002
It's in my shoe...
my shoe.

13:03.182 --> 13:05.446
Don't need
the four now, son.

13:18.297 --> 13:21.323
Damn, yo, where the shovel at?
Bury that nigger, man.

13:43.956 --> 13:45.821
Here you go, sir,
thank you.

13:45.858 --> 13:47.883
- Tommy Carcetti, running for mayor.
- Good luck, Tommy.

13:47.927 --> 13:49.554
- Hey, Mr. Carcetti, you got my vote.
- Thanks.

13:49.595 --> 13:51.153
- Tom Carcetti.
- Hey, thank you very much.

13:51.197 --> 13:52.562
- Here you go.
- Good luck, Councilman.

13:52.598 --> 13:54.429
How you doing?
Tommy Carcetti, running for mayor.

13:54.466 --> 13:57.435
Okay, Councilman,
time to hit the West Side.

14:09.648 --> 14:11.775
Pretty motherfucker...

14:11.817 --> 14:14.513
he's gonna make me go
to my game face.

14:16.822 --> 14:19.916
Okay, I'll take 25 of the honeysuckle
incense cones...

14:19.959 --> 14:21.893
they'll keep me
healthy for next week.

14:21.927 --> 14:25.488
- Tommy!
- Excuse me.

14:26.999 --> 14:31.299
Tony Gray's people say
20 minutes at their place.

14:32.872 --> 14:35.636
Shit, Clarence.
Look like you did in '98

14:35.674 --> 14:37.904
when you surprised
the hell out of everyone.

14:37.943 --> 14:39.570
Just bring 'em on.

14:43.082 --> 14:45.380
Why give it to us? Why don't you
stick it to Royce yourself?

14:45.417 --> 14:47.442
Because after what Tommy did
at the debate,

14:47.486 --> 14:50.546
it'll seem like more of the same
if it comes from him.

14:50.589 --> 14:54.923
And if we use it to take four
or five points out of Royce's base,

14:54.960 --> 14:56.791
it helps him as much as us.

14:56.829 --> 14:58.990
Once bitten, twice shy.

14:59.031 --> 15:01.761
With Tommy Carcetti,
I got to always think a step ahead.

15:01.800 --> 15:05.634
Look, Tony, you ain't gonna win.
So the only question is

15:05.671 --> 15:08.265
whether you wanna lose
with 24% of the vote

15:08.307 --> 15:10.207
or 28%.

15:10.242 --> 15:12.142
You bring the numbers up,

15:12.177 --> 15:14.338
you look good
for the legislature...

15:14.380 --> 15:17.577
maybe a congressional run.

15:17.616 --> 15:19.311
- Albert Stokes.
- Here.

15:19.351 --> 15:22.946
Mr. P., can I go? My moms told me to go
straight home after school.

15:22.988 --> 15:25.047
Mine too.

15:25.090 --> 15:27.615
You should have thought of that
before you smeared ink

15:27.660 --> 15:29.287
all over my desk.

15:29.328 --> 15:30.852
Weren't my fault.
My pen exploded.

15:32.665 --> 15:34.428
Michael.

15:34.466 --> 15:36.161
Michael Lee?

15:36.201 --> 15:38.431
Mr. P., please,
can I go?

15:38.470 --> 15:41.462
I ain't eat no lunch, and my stomach
making all these noises.

15:41.507 --> 15:46.001
Look, I won't ever disrespect
your pencil again, I promise.

15:46.045 --> 15:48.013
Zenobia, it wasn't
about the pencil.

15:48.047 --> 15:51.039
Please, Mr. P.

16:00.392 --> 16:04.260
- Okay okay, all right.
- All right.

16:04.296 --> 16:06.491
Just this one time,
I'll make an exception.

16:08.834 --> 16:11.667
But next time, expect
to stay the full hour.

16:24.583 --> 16:26.915
- Why are you here?
- Came to say sorry.

16:26.952 --> 16:29.546
I didn't mean to get
all up in your face like that.

16:30.889 --> 16:32.516
I appreciate that, Namond.

16:32.558 --> 16:35.152
It takes courage
to admit when you're wrong.

16:35.194 --> 16:38.357
What I can't understand... I've seen you
in Ms. Sampson's class doing your work.

16:38.397 --> 16:41.560
- Why can't you do the same in here?
- I mean to, I do.

16:41.600 --> 16:45.127
It's just the evil get in me and before
I know it, I go off.

16:47.072 --> 16:49.097
Well...

16:49.141 --> 16:51.075
tomorrow we'll see
if we can do better.

16:51.110 --> 16:53.772
Can't tomorrow.
Mrs. D. Put me out.

16:53.812 --> 16:57.145
I gotta bump.
Later, Mr. P.

17:00.152 --> 17:02.586
If you can wait
outside...

17:02.621 --> 17:04.612
It's okay.
He can stay.

17:08.627 --> 17:09.616
Thank you.

17:11.096 --> 17:14.623
Mr. P., you know
Michael can't make it to detention.

17:14.665 --> 17:16.691
I know he didn't.
Now it's doubled.

17:16.734 --> 17:19.568
- He's got two days to serve.
- Nah, I mean, he can't.

17:19.605 --> 17:21.936
He got to go pick up
his little brother from school.

17:21.973 --> 17:24.169
Well, he'll just have to
find somebody else to do that.

17:25.544 --> 17:28.205
It... it ain't like that.

17:28.247 --> 17:29.874
I mean, Michael would come
if he could,

17:29.915 --> 17:32.850
but wouldn't have nobody else
to pick up his little brother Bug.

17:32.885 --> 17:35.115
You know, his mother,
she on that stuff.

17:41.827 --> 17:43.761
We walking home.
You coming?

17:43.796 --> 17:47.357
Oh, no, I'm waiting on Alpo.
Ms. Sampson got him doing detention.

17:47.399 --> 17:49.697
- You gonna be here till, like, 5:00.
- Yeah, she a hard lady.

17:49.735 --> 17:51.600
She don't ever give
a brother no play.

17:51.637 --> 17:55.505
- All right. I'll holla at you later.
- All right, yo.

17:57.609 --> 18:00.237
So you're not gonna be
in the NBA?

18:00.279 --> 18:03.180
Then it must be the NFL?

18:03.215 --> 18:05.843
I thought all the boys in class
were gonna join the pros.

18:05.884 --> 18:07.442
Nah, that's just
something we say.

18:08.454 --> 18:10.718
So what about you?

18:10.756 --> 18:12.986
What do you wanna be
when you grow up?

18:13.025 --> 18:15.425
I'm gonna own
my own store.

18:15.461 --> 18:18.555
That's smart. You're gonna need
to know a lot of math.

18:22.167 --> 18:24.499
You left them in there.

18:25.871 --> 18:28.135
- Oh-hh.
- Hey, don't worry, Mr. P.

18:28.173 --> 18:31.165
We got you.
Hey, Donut!

18:31.210 --> 18:33.838
- Yo, yeah.
- Donut's crazy with cars.

18:33.879 --> 18:35.346
He can open anything.

18:35.380 --> 18:36.711
- Hey. What up, man?
- Hey.

18:36.748 --> 18:39.876
Yo, he locked
his keys in there.

18:43.589 --> 18:45.853
It's okay,
I can call AAA.

18:45.891 --> 18:47.518
Oh, no problem, chief.

19:29.334 --> 19:31.666
Feel the need
to work them corners, huh?

19:33.739 --> 19:36.469
I'm just asking 'cause you don't need
to be doing what you're doing.

19:36.508 --> 19:38.442
I need to learn some shit
on my own.

19:38.477 --> 19:41.310
I'm trying
to help you, Sherrod,

19:41.346 --> 19:43.439
but you making it
so I can't.

19:43.482 --> 19:45.416
I didn't even know
the man who beat on you, Bubs.

19:45.450 --> 19:47.077
He was short money
on the corner.

19:47.119 --> 19:49.053
I swear he wasn't
nothing to me.

19:49.087 --> 19:52.318
Yeah, but when the shit start,
there's nothing to be done, right?

19:52.357 --> 19:55.292
What would I have done
if he started whaling on you?

19:55.327 --> 19:59.320
Same kind of nothing, see?
That's how the corners be.

20:00.799 --> 20:03.097
They going to use you up,
Sherrod.

20:08.340 --> 20:12.572
You welcome to stay tonight, but you
ain't in school tomorrow morning,

20:12.611 --> 20:14.670
this partnership need
to be done.

20:43.709 --> 20:46.269
These two precincts
are the bellwether for the Fifth.

20:46.311 --> 20:49.747
If you can take even 18%
out of Carcetti in these,

20:49.781 --> 20:52.249
it's a good guess he won't
have the numbers citywide.

20:52.284 --> 20:54.377
And who are we ticketed
with over here?

20:54.419 --> 20:57.479
The N.D.O.,
I hope, because...

20:59.224 --> 21:02.716
...this amid allegations that
high-ranking police officials intervened

21:02.761 --> 21:06.754
to have a veteran police detective
removed from the controversial case.

21:06.798 --> 21:10.029
The Braddock murder became
a focal point in the mayoral campaign

21:10.068 --> 21:12.400
when Councilman
Thomas Carcetti alleged

21:12.437 --> 21:14.428
the West Baltimore man
was killed

21:14.473 --> 21:16.703
because he was
a witness in the case.

21:16.742 --> 21:18.642
...Because they were afraid
the police would prove

21:18.677 --> 21:20.770
what they most fear, that
Fredro Braddock was murdered

21:20.812 --> 21:24.077
because he was a witness,
and the city failed to protect him.

21:25.917 --> 21:27.782
It's on all three channels.

21:27.819 --> 21:30.515
And "The Sun" and "The Post"
are both calling for comment.

21:34.826 --> 21:37.454
And my sources within the department say
the rank-and-file officers

21:37.496 --> 21:39.896
are simply appalled by this blatant
political manipulation.

21:39.931 --> 21:41.558
Damn, turn it up.

21:41.600 --> 21:44.296
Hey, Greggs, you're famous.

21:44.336 --> 21:46.600
...is to remove
a highly-decorated veteran

21:46.638 --> 21:49.698
with 15 years' experience as a murder
investigator without reason...

21:49.741 --> 21:51.538
- That'd be me.
- Then replaced with a rookie

21:51.576 --> 21:53.510
who has yet to handle a single
homicide investigation...

21:53.545 --> 21:55.911
- That'd be you.
...then we need to rethink...

21:55.947 --> 21:57.244
- The fuck I ever do to him?

22:01.753 --> 22:03.345
You gonna make it
too heavy, yo.

22:03.388 --> 22:05.219
It might work
if we make it bigger.

22:05.257 --> 22:07.282
It would work if we
had balsa wood, you know?

22:07.326 --> 22:10.090
- It's really light and strong.
- Man, you so full of...

22:10.128 --> 22:12.562
oh, shit.

22:17.836 --> 22:19.428
Zombie Master.

22:25.444 --> 22:27.435
Need to take us
a little walk.

22:28.680 --> 22:30.614
Nah, I'm good here.

22:30.649 --> 22:33.243
Yo. Young'uns need
to move along.

22:34.953 --> 22:37.217
Sure, Chris, we'll bump.

22:42.794 --> 22:44.921
- Yo, Snoop, your sister in my class.
- What the fuck?

22:44.963 --> 22:46.555
You high
or something, nigger?

22:48.533 --> 22:50.967
You boys be
smoking that shit?

22:54.406 --> 22:56.636
Hearing good things
about you.

22:56.675 --> 22:58.836
Say you straight up,
take care of your people,

22:58.877 --> 23:01.402
not begging no handouts.

23:01.446 --> 23:03.710
Motherfucker, you hear the nigger
talking to you,

23:03.749 --> 23:07.310
giving you praises and shit. You
standing here looking fucking stupid.

23:07.352 --> 23:09.650
Yo, chill.

23:09.688 --> 23:11.417
Sometimes
she get a little hot.

23:11.456 --> 23:14.482
I'm just saying
the boy ain't right!

23:14.526 --> 23:17.461
Yo, we always in the market
for a good soldier.

23:17.496 --> 23:20.897
When we see one we like,
we take care of the situation...

23:20.932 --> 23:24.129
take him in, school him,
make him family.

23:24.169 --> 23:25.932
And if you're with us,
you're with us,

23:25.971 --> 23:28.667
just like we'd be
with you all the way.

23:28.707 --> 23:30.299
You have a mind,
you're in.

23:31.343 --> 23:33.971
Look, man.
I already got a family...

23:34.012 --> 23:36.640
my moms
and my little brother.

23:36.681 --> 23:39.582
Yeah, heard that.

23:39.618 --> 23:41.609
But think on it.

23:44.823 --> 23:47.121
We'll be around
if you need something.

24:01.239 --> 24:03.207
He saw me, yo. I knew it.

24:03.241 --> 24:05.141
I knew Chris was asking Michael
about me.

24:05.177 --> 24:06.804
I knew it, man.
I'm dead.

24:09.748 --> 24:11.181
- Yo, man, good looking out.
- Yeah.

24:11.216 --> 24:13.184
- I thought they was gonna...
- Yeah, I know, I know.

24:13.218 --> 24:15.550
What-what he ask about me?
I know he asked about me.

24:15.587 --> 24:17.487
- What'd you say? What'd you tell him?
- Calm down,

24:17.522 --> 24:19.114
- it weren't even about you.
- Yo, for real,

24:19.157 --> 24:21.751
you need to tell me.
What did he ask you?

24:23.161 --> 24:26.653
Yo, you right, man.
Chris was all up in your business.

24:26.698 --> 24:28.962
He down on you
for some deep shit, man.

24:29.000 --> 24:31.696
I don't even know what.

24:33.271 --> 24:35.466
Nah, I'm just fucking
with you, man.

24:35.507 --> 24:38.203
He didn't even
speak your name.

24:44.883 --> 24:46.874
Oh, man.

24:49.788 --> 24:53.724
So, Erv, what's next? Your officers
gonna shoot a couple of tourists?

24:53.758 --> 24:56.659
Maybe fly a helicopter
into Harbor Place?

24:56.695 --> 25:00.563
What can we expect the last week
of my re-election campaign?

25:00.599 --> 25:02.464
Sir, I did what you asked...
no more, no less.

25:02.501 --> 25:04.696
Hamsterdam...
legalized drug zone?

25:04.736 --> 25:06.499
Oh, he takes responsibility
for that.

25:06.538 --> 25:08.836
- The subpoenas all over town.
- That, too.

25:08.874 --> 25:12.002
Well, then the leak about the witness
murder. That was his shop too, right?

25:12.043 --> 25:14.568
- Hell, yeah.
- And now this last thing,

25:14.613 --> 25:19.380
transferring detectives off the case...
what is that? What is that?

25:19.417 --> 25:21.885
- Scuttling the investigation.
- Yeah, right.

25:21.920 --> 25:24.684
- Yeah, that's awful... Jesus!
- Mr. Mayor, you asked me

25:24.723 --> 25:27.521
- to slow that investigation down.
- Mm-mmm, mm-mmm.

25:27.559 --> 25:29.823
Subtle, Ervin. Hmm?

25:29.861 --> 25:32.159
You hold a few facts
for a few weeks.

25:32.197 --> 25:35.166
You put a report or two
in a desk drawer.

25:35.200 --> 25:37.532
But the transferring
of people off a case?!

25:37.569 --> 25:40.436
Look, you told me...

25:40.472 --> 25:42.303
you specifically
wanted me to not...

25:42.340 --> 25:44.433
Ervin, you may leave.

25:44.476 --> 25:49.175
- Mr. Mayor...
- That will be all, Commissioner.

25:59.324 --> 26:01.588
Nuh-uh.

26:01.626 --> 26:05.426
No, I need a word or two
with your deputy, Ervin.

26:17.776 --> 26:19.437
Have a seat.

26:27.218 --> 26:29.186
I tried to warn him.

26:29.220 --> 26:31.688
I mean, if it leaked out of Homicide
about the dead witness,

26:31.723 --> 26:33.748
why wouldn't it leak that we
bumped a detective?

26:33.792 --> 26:35.350
Why didn't you come to us
beforehand?

26:37.128 --> 26:40.359
I'm a loyal subordinate,
Mr. Mayor,

26:40.398 --> 26:43.265
and Ervin is a good man working
under considerable pressure.

26:43.301 --> 26:44.700
He's a hack.

26:44.736 --> 26:47.170
You're not bothered
by the pressure, Deputy?

26:47.205 --> 26:49.196
Not in the least.

26:54.579 --> 26:56.877
I need you to make this
go away, Bill.

26:56.915 --> 26:59.679
I won't forget,
believe me.

27:11.496 --> 27:14.431
Another thing... Slim Charles
got up with me.

27:14.466 --> 27:16.297
Said the fat man
want a sitdown.

27:16.334 --> 27:18.359
Nah. I did that already.

27:18.403 --> 27:22.271
Well, Slim say the fat man knew
the card game was gonna get took.

27:22.307 --> 27:25.242
He did, did he?
Set it up.

27:25.276 --> 27:27.767
Why you always
be back here?

27:27.812 --> 27:30.042
Quiet. And I can see
what comes.

27:30.081 --> 27:32.413
But you out in the weather
and shit.

27:32.450 --> 27:35.010
- I don't like to speak in no rooms.
- Yeah.

27:35.053 --> 27:36.953
Yo, oh-oh,
you ain't staying long.

27:40.125 --> 27:42.889
So you know,
I almost got that for you.

27:42.927 --> 27:44.519
I just need
a couple of days more.

27:44.562 --> 27:46.496
You can keep my money
for now.

27:46.531 --> 27:49.762
- I got something that needs doing.
- Anything, Marlo... your call.

27:49.801 --> 27:53.498
Omar gonna come in your store,
stick it up, rob you.

27:53.538 --> 27:57.907
You gonna call the police,
make a report. You feel me?

27:57.942 --> 28:00.706
Yeah, that'll work, but, uh,
you know when he get out,

28:00.745 --> 28:03.179
he's coming right at me,
I ain't scared or nothing.

28:03.214 --> 28:05.375
- I'm just saying, you know?
- He ain't gonna get out.

28:13.291 --> 28:15.418
A man make bail on robbery.

28:15.460 --> 28:17.985
Make it no bail.

28:20.999 --> 28:23.399
If you have a problem,

28:23.435 --> 28:25.335
like you can't make it
to detention,

28:25.370 --> 28:27.361
you need to tell me.

28:27.405 --> 28:29.032
That's your responsibility.

28:29.074 --> 28:31.872
People will be more than willing
to help you out,

28:31.910 --> 28:33.901
but it's up to you to ask.

28:35.313 --> 28:37.304
You can go back
to the cafeteria...

28:38.483 --> 28:40.144
or hang up here.

28:50.528 --> 28:53.497
Duquan,
could you come here?

29:04.576 --> 29:08.376
I thought maybe you could help me out...
I packed too much.

29:28.700 --> 29:30.327
Take this down
to the cafeteria

29:30.368 --> 29:32.427
and get yourself something to drink
from the machine.

29:32.470 --> 29:34.665
Thank you.

29:43.748 --> 29:46.717
Crystal,
you got a second?

29:48.486 --> 29:50.852
What's up with Duquan?

29:50.889 --> 29:53.323
I gave him some new clothes.
I was expecting...

29:53.358 --> 29:55.451
He might have lost them.

29:55.493 --> 29:57.484
That fast?

29:58.496 --> 30:00.259
It weren't that.

30:00.298 --> 30:03.495
His people take his clothes,
sell it on the corners.

30:03.535 --> 30:05.469
- You're kidding.
- No, sir.

30:05.503 --> 30:07.494
Everybody knows.

30:11.242 --> 30:13.039
Which brings me to
what we're proposing...

30:13.077 --> 30:14.840
different kids,
different approaches.

30:14.879 --> 30:17.473
You tell us who we need to touch
at North Avenue to get the go-ahead.

30:17.515 --> 30:19.244
The "Puzzle Palace"?

30:19.284 --> 30:22.913
Look, if y'all still wanna jump in
and help, I'm fine with it.

30:22.954 --> 30:24.979
That's about all the okay
you need in my house.

30:26.891 --> 30:30.292
The Stricker Street situation is
waiting in the office.

30:32.230 --> 30:35.393
Neighborhood squabbles,
and my babies bring it in here.

30:35.433 --> 30:39.028
Two fights yesterday... all because
the mothers can't get along.

30:39.070 --> 30:40.833
I gotta go.

30:40.872 --> 30:43.534
Mrs. Donnelly will work out
the nuts and bolts.

30:45.009 --> 30:47.910
But just so you hear it,
thank you.

30:47.946 --> 30:51.609
It'll be the only time anyone
in this system will think to say it.

30:55.086 --> 30:57.077
He's a good man.
You need to protect him.

30:57.121 --> 30:59.214
- Protect him?
- Principal Withers

30:59.257 --> 31:00.884
just went out on a limb for you,

31:00.925 --> 31:04.053
and in this system they know
how to handle a chainsaw.

31:04.095 --> 31:05.824
Excuse me?

31:05.864 --> 31:07.889
Anyone has a problem
with what we're doing,

31:07.932 --> 31:09.900
it's on him.

31:09.934 --> 31:12.903
So you specified
eighth-graders?

31:12.937 --> 31:17.169
We have 256 on roll.

31:17.208 --> 31:19.403
241 attend
on a regular basis.

31:19.444 --> 31:22.709
Of those, 40 or so would fit your bill
of corner kids.

31:22.747 --> 31:24.647
40?

31:26.317 --> 31:28.478
Pretty workable.

31:28.519 --> 31:30.714
Ahem.

31:30.755 --> 31:33.485
- What would you suggest?
- Start with 10 or so.

31:33.524 --> 31:35.151
Ms. Sampson has enough
to get you going.

31:35.193 --> 31:37.957
- One of them named Namond Brice?
- Pick of the litter.

31:37.996 --> 31:40.396
But you'll have to wait.
He's on a three-day suspension.

31:40.431 --> 31:43.025
Tilghman Middle School.
Can I help you?

31:50.975 --> 31:54.570
Remember when I was a cadet,
I was up here on a cadaver search.

31:54.612 --> 31:56.375
Instructor gets
on the radio to say,

31:56.414 --> 31:58.848
"We're looking for
one body in particular.

31:58.883 --> 32:02.250
If you go grabbing
everyone you see,

32:02.287 --> 32:04.482
we'll be here all day," he says.

32:04.522 --> 32:06.820
Leakin Park...

32:06.858 --> 32:09.292
where West Baltimore
brings out its dead.

32:09.327 --> 32:12.125
Not anymore,
from the look of things.

32:12.163 --> 32:14.324
Not by the roadside,
anyway.

32:16.567 --> 32:18.398
If he's dumping them here,

32:18.436 --> 32:20.301
he's dumping them
deep in the woods.

32:23.041 --> 32:24.838
Come on.

32:24.876 --> 32:28.710
At each raid site,
we're anticipating dope

32:28.746 --> 32:31.044
or cash or guns.

32:31.082 --> 32:33.448
All warrants are
for prime locations

32:33.484 --> 32:35.975
linked to high-level
violators.

32:36.020 --> 32:39.046
Weeks-old addresses linked
to low-level corner boys.

32:39.090 --> 32:41.456
We'll also be sweeping drug corners
at these locations.

32:41.492 --> 32:44.188
Wagons will hold
in this location here.

32:44.228 --> 32:46.822
Jump-off time...
1500 hours.

32:46.864 --> 32:50.197
We take our position
10 minutes before the assault here.

32:50.234 --> 32:52.202
The go is on my say-so.

32:54.072 --> 32:56.131
Questions? Excellent.

32:56.174 --> 32:58.938
We'll hold in the rec room
till it's time to stage.

33:05.350 --> 33:07.181
Warrants are one thing,

33:07.218 --> 33:09.948
but street sweeps on Marlo Stanfield's
crews? Are you guys serious?

33:09.988 --> 33:11.956
Carv, you give these hoodleheads
too much credit.

33:11.990 --> 33:13.651
Trust me on this, Boy Wonder.

33:13.691 --> 33:16.854
Never mind this horseshit.

33:16.894 --> 33:18.828
So what've they got you
doing for your man?

33:18.863 --> 33:20.990
Who, the lieutenant?

33:21.032 --> 33:24.195
No, Royce. Herc, the mayor's
your meal ticket.

33:24.235 --> 33:26.829
He gets another four years,
you're liable to wear the gold braid.

33:26.871 --> 33:29.431
Shouldn't you be out
waving a campaign sign or some shit?

33:34.712 --> 33:38.273
And so ends the last crusade
of the Major Crimes Unit...

33:38.316 --> 33:40.250
with a whimper.

33:40.284 --> 33:44.721
Lester would cry to see his wiretap
cannibalized for that crap.

33:44.756 --> 33:47.919
Street sweeps
on Marlo Stanfield?

33:51.329 --> 33:53.627
- So what else you got cooking?
- Narcotics cases?

33:53.664 --> 33:57.862
C.I.D. Has the Burman indictment
coming in. Nothing past that.

33:57.902 --> 34:01.463
As wars go, this drug thing
seems to rate less and less.

34:02.940 --> 34:06.034
If Demper wins and manages
to forgive my trespasses,

34:06.077 --> 34:08.101
maybe I'll go in and beg
for something new.

34:08.146 --> 34:12.411
I don't know. Just feels like
enough's enough.

34:14.185 --> 34:16.652
Crutchfield, line two, Intake.

34:20.324 --> 34:23.225
- Sergeant, you were looking for me?
- I was, yeah.

34:23.261 --> 34:27.197
Curly fry?
Chicken doohickey?

34:27.231 --> 34:29.665
Sit down.

34:34.304 --> 34:36.864
Norris is back
on the Braddock case.

34:37.975 --> 34:39.875
It's by order
of the deputy ops.

34:39.911 --> 34:41.969
In fact, we're gonna go
with a story that says

34:42.013 --> 34:45.072
he was never off the case,
that you and he are partnered,

34:45.116 --> 34:47.812
a task force of two,
working it together.

34:49.219 --> 34:52.188
Fuck you, fat man.

34:52.223 --> 34:56.091
Not original, but succinct.
I like your approach.

34:56.127 --> 34:58.789
Y'all humiliate me once
by dropping me into this thing,

34:58.830 --> 35:01.890
and now you're gonna shame me again
by bringing Norris back.

35:16.481 --> 35:17.971
This is Homicide, Detective.

35:18.015 --> 35:20.813
This is not some boiler room unit
where no one pays attention

35:20.852 --> 35:22.843
to whatever the fuck it is
you call police work.

35:22.887 --> 35:25.685
The bosses?
They know our names up here.

35:25.723 --> 35:29.318
Now I didn't like it
when they came to me

35:29.360 --> 35:32.295
and told me to dump Norris,
but dump him I did.

35:32.330 --> 35:34.298
And it's not like I wanna
carry water for them

35:34.332 --> 35:36.892
now that they're pretending
they never told me to do any such thing,

35:36.934 --> 35:39.368
but carry the water I will.
And in the end,

35:39.403 --> 35:42.600
when everyone else in this unit
is buried and beshitted,

35:42.640 --> 35:46.132
this detective sergeant
will still be standing.

35:48.112 --> 35:51.138
So get the story straight:

35:51.182 --> 35:52.877
Norris was always
the primary,

35:52.917 --> 35:54.976
and you are now assisting
on an investigation

35:55.019 --> 35:57.817
which is progressing
even as we speak.

35:57.855 --> 35:59.686
Does the colonel
know about this?

36:01.492 --> 36:03.619
He's in the hospital...

36:03.661 --> 36:05.652
chemo didn't work.

36:09.300 --> 36:11.894
Press conference is upstairs
in half an hour.

36:11.936 --> 36:14.063
- So don't be late.
- Press conference?

36:14.105 --> 36:16.266
Mm-hmm.

36:22.046 --> 36:24.776
I ain't mean
to laugh at you none.

36:24.815 --> 36:27.909
I know it sound crazy,
but I ain't joking.

36:27.952 --> 36:29.852
For real, Lex a zombie.

36:29.887 --> 36:31.787
I knew it way before
what Na' and them was saying.

36:31.822 --> 36:34.416
Listen,

36:34.458 --> 36:37.120
they had me tell Lex to go up
to the playground.

36:37.161 --> 36:39.061
I told him to go up there
and see some girl.

36:39.096 --> 36:42.259
He ain't never come
back down.

36:42.300 --> 36:45.167
So what they gonna do to me
when they get mad at me?

36:45.203 --> 36:47.694
It makes sense Chris taking them
into the vacants...

36:47.738 --> 36:49.968
to change them.
And you know what else?

36:50.007 --> 36:51.634
That ain't
what he doing...

36:51.676 --> 36:54.736
Chris in the vacants.

36:54.779 --> 36:56.542
Changing them?

36:56.581 --> 36:58.310
He ain't changing them,
he killing them.

36:58.349 --> 37:00.510
That's all.
They're getting killed.

37:00.551 --> 37:02.542
How you know?

37:04.789 --> 37:07.189
Can't tell nobody.

37:08.526 --> 37:11.256
I seen it.

37:11.295 --> 37:13.855
I seen them walk
a boy up into one house

37:13.898 --> 37:15.525
over there on Calhoun.

37:15.566 --> 37:17.557
You seen that?

37:18.569 --> 37:20.901
Yeah.

37:20.938 --> 37:22.462
That's just false.

37:22.506 --> 37:24.667
Detective Norris has been
working in this case nonstop.

37:24.709 --> 37:26.836
And given her narcotics
expertise,

37:26.877 --> 37:29.402
Detective Greggs
was assigned to augment

37:29.447 --> 37:31.142
rather than to replace him.

37:31.182 --> 37:33.946
But for two days sources
inside the department were saying...

37:33.985 --> 37:36.647
I'm inside the department,
and I'm telling you that's not true.

37:36.687 --> 37:39.747
We do not play politics
with a criminal investigation.

37:39.790 --> 37:42.418
And how do you explain
Councilman Gray's allegations?

37:42.460 --> 37:45.156
I think you should ask
Councilman Gray that question.

37:51.636 --> 37:55.436
- Police! Search warrant!
- Take the back.

37:55.473 --> 37:58.203
- On the ground, now!
- Police! Search warrant!

37:58.242 --> 37:59.937
Two upstairs.

38:02.813 --> 38:04.542
- Don't move!
- Check that backroom.

38:04.582 --> 38:05.810
I said, get your ass
on the ground.

38:05.850 --> 38:06.874
- Get down!
- Get down!

38:17.161 --> 38:21.120
- This is the 1300 block, right?
- No, this is the 12.

38:21.165 --> 38:22.894
Are we on the right corner?

38:24.568 --> 38:26.900
- We had this as a stash house?
- According to the wiretap.

38:26.937 --> 38:28.905
How long ago?
They move them around, you know.

38:36.580 --> 38:38.741
- Zeroes on the warrants.
- Minor arrests

38:38.783 --> 38:41.445
- on the designated corners, sir.
- They were tipped!

38:41.485 --> 38:43.510
- You think?
- For us to come up this empty

38:43.554 --> 38:45.044
at all these locations,
it has to be.

38:45.089 --> 38:47.353
This cocksucker Marlo thinks
he's smarter than us?

38:47.391 --> 38:50.189
He is not. Sergeant, I want
to know where he hangs.

38:50.227 --> 38:52.320
You mean like him personally?

38:52.363 --> 38:54.388
He moves around,
Lieutenant. He floats.

38:54.432 --> 38:56.662
But I have seen him
in the concrete park behind Fulton.

38:56.701 --> 38:58.362
- In a park?
- If the weather's right, he sits

38:58.402 --> 38:59.733
out there in some lawn chairs,
holds court.

38:59.770 --> 39:01.601
He's got people covering
every approach

39:01.639 --> 39:04.472
so there's no creeping up on him. My
guess is that he likes to talk outdoors

39:04.508 --> 39:06.237
so no one can drop
a microphone on him.

39:06.277 --> 39:09.974
Sergeant, what can
we do with that?

39:17.121 --> 39:19.749
I admit I've made
some mistakes,

39:19.790 --> 39:21.621
Burrell being
one of the biggest.

39:21.659 --> 39:24.719
But he's got a job
for about 10 more days.

39:24.762 --> 39:28.596
After the primary,
he's gone, believe me.

39:28.632 --> 39:31.726
And that last stunt...
pulling a detective.

39:31.769 --> 39:34.670
- What'd you expect?
- Not that... huh-uh.

39:36.040 --> 39:39.567
Hey, I had nothing to do
with that nonsense.

39:39.610 --> 39:42.636
Now, that's a straight-up lie. I was
at that damn meeting when you told him,

39:42.680 --> 39:45.308
- "Slow the case down."
- I didn't mean...

39:45.349 --> 39:48.375
Who the hell knows
what you mean anymore, Clarence?

39:48.419 --> 39:50.410
Look at this.

39:51.455 --> 39:53.719
Look at it!

39:53.758 --> 39:56.522
You gave me
your word on this...

39:56.560 --> 39:58.619
your word, Clarence.

39:58.662 --> 40:01.927
But here you are ticketed up
with Eunetta in her best precincts

40:01.966 --> 40:04.434
and then ticketed up
with my girl Daniels

40:04.468 --> 40:06.095
where she's
running strong.

40:06.137 --> 40:08.401
Odell, this is the first
I've seen this.

40:08.439 --> 40:12.136
Come on, now! This is probably
Eunetta's people pulling this shit.

40:12.176 --> 40:14.576
With a "Citizens for Royce"
authority line?

40:14.612 --> 40:18.309
Eh, look at you, Clarence.
Just look at you.

40:18.349 --> 40:22.080
You've forgotten your agenda.
You've forgotten your base.

40:22.119 --> 40:24.087
You think a shave

40:24.121 --> 40:26.351
and some Marcus Garvey posters
are gonna get you over?

40:26.390 --> 40:28.449
Do you think that's gonna
make up for jumping in bed

40:28.492 --> 40:30.153
with every damn
developer?

40:30.194 --> 40:34.324
Shit. You're even
on Clay Davis's tit.

40:34.365 --> 40:37.357
Now don't you go getting
all self-righteous with me, Odell.

40:37.401 --> 40:39.835
Campaign runs on dollars...
you know it.

40:39.870 --> 40:43.135
Whose dollars?! Those sons of bitches
you got around your card table

40:43.174 --> 40:46.302
every month feeding your kitty?
Oh, yeah,

40:46.343 --> 40:50.439
I know about that too.
You... trouble with you...

40:50.481 --> 40:54.975
fuck you, Clarence. I'm gonna
sit what's left of this one out.

40:55.019 --> 40:57.544
- I'm gonna sit it out.
- Sit it out.

40:57.588 --> 41:00.557
- The primary?
- Sit it out!

41:00.591 --> 41:03.458
Odell!
Odell!

41:03.494 --> 41:05.689
Who the hell do you
think you are, huh?

41:05.729 --> 41:08.163
Come November, I'm still gonna be
the only game in town!

41:08.199 --> 41:10.793
Odell, turn your back on me now,
I won't forget!

41:10.835 --> 41:13.998
We can't afford this.
We need his organization on Tuesday.

41:14.038 --> 41:16.006
- Go after him!
- Fuck that

41:16.040 --> 41:18.838
holier-than-thou
motherfucker!

41:20.211 --> 41:24.409
Delegate Watkins.
Delegate Watkins!

41:24.448 --> 41:26.177
Wait, sir.

41:26.217 --> 41:29.277
I-I'm sure we can
work this out.

41:29.320 --> 41:31.083
You and the mayor
can talk this through.

41:41.832 --> 41:43.823
Deputy Rawls, please.

41:44.902 --> 41:47.496
It's Lieutenant Hoskins
at the Hall.

42:08.826 --> 42:10.885
You're gonna use the hole
in the wall, right?

42:10.928 --> 42:13.795
Yeah, I'm gonna rub some dogshit
on the front of this thing.

42:13.831 --> 42:15.822
I don't want nobody
touching it.

42:18.836 --> 42:21.464
Got it?

42:29.246 --> 42:31.077
You need
to raise it a bit.

42:40.090 --> 42:41.785
Yeah, that's good.
Right there, that works.

42:46.597 --> 42:49.464
- Thought I heard something.
- Rats.

42:49.500 --> 42:51.195
- How we doing?
- We need to go.

43:32.409 --> 43:34.969
He ain't nothing
but a skanky-ass bitch to begin with.

43:35.012 --> 43:36.639
And besides,
he ex-police.

43:36.680 --> 43:39.410
So you know what that like.

43:39.450 --> 43:41.315
I'm going to the ladies' room.

43:41.352 --> 43:43.786
Bey, you need to talk to him.

43:44.822 --> 43:47.450
Visiting hours
end in 30 minutes.

43:47.491 --> 43:49.618
- Visiting hours...
- Yo, Daddy, don't even go there,

43:49.660 --> 43:52.686
with you all the time telling me
how you dropped out in the sixth grade,

43:52.730 --> 43:54.561
went up on the corner
with Avon and Stringer,

43:54.598 --> 43:56.930
earned cheese for the family, saying
how it made you a man...

43:56.967 --> 43:58.901
All right, all right.
You right.

43:58.936 --> 44:01.302
Can't throw rocks.
But I'm just saying,

44:01.338 --> 44:03.806
you know how your mother be,
with all the fussing.

44:03.841 --> 44:07.743
Maybe you just need to slow it up.
You know what I'm saying?

44:07.778 --> 44:09.973
Yo, you heard
how Marlo punked Bodie?

44:10.014 --> 44:12.414
Said he either got to work for him
or give up his corner.

44:12.449 --> 44:14.917
Don't you know?
His sorry ass buckled.

44:14.952 --> 44:17.011
Oh-hh, you'd have gone
about it different?

44:17.054 --> 44:19.682
Yeah, I'd have
stood tall, like you.

44:19.723 --> 44:21.520
Got my nine...
fuck Chris and them.

44:21.558 --> 44:24.391
Listen to you,
all spit and fire.

44:24.428 --> 44:26.328
You'd have gone to the mattress
all by your lonesome

44:26.363 --> 44:28.888
and went up against
half of the West side.

44:28.932 --> 44:32.424
You got it where it counts,
and I respect that more than anything.

44:32.469 --> 44:35.996
But shit out there now ain't like
it was when we was coming up.

44:36.040 --> 44:39.601
Back in the day, a punk nigger
like Marlo steps out,

44:39.643 --> 44:43.010
breaking the rules and shit, he find
himself in the back of a car trunk

44:43.047 --> 44:45.311
on the way to Leakin Park.
No doubt.

44:45.349 --> 44:48.182
We did that shit right.
Word was your bond.

44:48.218 --> 44:51.346
Man looked out for his own,
knowing he in a family.

44:51.388 --> 44:53.083
Dig where
I'm coming from?

44:53.123 --> 44:56.286
But today
it's all fucked up.

45:12.743 --> 45:15.075
These steps.

45:15.112 --> 45:17.410
- Thank you, baby.
- You're good to go.

45:42.139 --> 45:45.131
Say "Omar."

45:45.175 --> 45:46.699
Omar.

45:59.022 --> 46:01.582
Nothing?

46:01.625 --> 46:03.593
We checked both sides
of the street

46:03.627 --> 46:05.686
- from here up to Monroe.
- Nothing?

46:05.729 --> 46:07.663
Nothing that don't
belong in no sewer.

46:07.698 --> 46:09.290
Thanks.

46:16.006 --> 46:18.099
Other ideas?

46:18.142 --> 46:19.803
Whoo!

46:23.514 --> 46:27.109
Blood, bump me off that nigger
up the "skreet."

46:27.151 --> 46:29.119
Motherfucker
in the "Bruick"?

46:29.153 --> 46:31.018
That be him.
I be saying,

46:31.054 --> 46:33.818
no motherfucker gonna
run off with my "hairon."

46:33.857 --> 46:35.722
Oh, this is
fucking great.

46:35.759 --> 46:39.456
Get somebody who reads lips,
this motherfucker's history.

46:39.496 --> 46:42.192
Is this legal... I mean,
intercepting what they're saying?

46:42.232 --> 46:44.826
Don't go Freamon on me.

46:46.503 --> 46:49.404
Shit. I got to run.

46:49.439 --> 46:52.169
Hey, man, what about some
fucking relief? I been here all morning!

47:13.964 --> 47:17.991
You heard?
They making movies.

47:18.035 --> 47:20.833
Yeah. How you
wanna play it?

47:20.871 --> 47:24.238
I ain't sure.
Let's see the fat man.

47:25.509 --> 47:27.670
How'd the other thing
turn out?

47:27.711 --> 47:29.702
All good.

47:33.884 --> 47:35.852
- Yo.
- What up, boy?

47:35.886 --> 47:37.979
- If you want some, I got Reeses.
- Nah, man.

47:38.021 --> 47:40.717
You trying to make
some real cheese? $5?

47:40.757 --> 47:45.023
- What you need?
- Me and Paul gonna get it on with Tiff.

47:45.062 --> 47:47.394
Keep an eye out. I don't want Mrs. D
creeping up. Feel me?

47:47.431 --> 47:50.332
I feel you, but I got some sixth-graders
waiting on a special order.

47:50.367 --> 47:53.962
Let them wait, man.
It ain't like we gonna be all day.

47:57.975 --> 47:59.966
All right.

48:01.945 --> 48:04.846
No, ma'am, it says right here...
His Honor had the Bureau of Solid Waste

48:04.882 --> 48:06.543
conduct a clean sweep
along Tivoly.

48:06.583 --> 48:08.778
But it took six months
before they showed up.

48:08.819 --> 48:10.810
Well yeah, okay,
but nobody's perfect.

48:10.854 --> 48:13.414
But hey, listen. I wouldn't be
sitting here if I didn't believe

48:13.457 --> 48:16.255
Clarence Royce wasn't truly committed
to this city and its people.

48:16.293 --> 48:18.056
What about the crime
in our neighborhood?

48:18.095 --> 48:19.722
I admit that's another
good point.

48:19.763 --> 48:23.358
But, lady,
between you and me, I can tell

48:23.400 --> 48:26.267
from your voice you're black and
you can tell from my voice I'm white.

48:26.303 --> 48:28.271
So I gotta ask you,

48:28.305 --> 48:31.001
when do you think the last time
a white man voted for a black man

48:31.041 --> 48:33.032
when there was another
white man in the race?

48:33.076 --> 48:34.976
I don't know, but you must
really believe in him.

48:35.012 --> 48:38.448
Well, ain't that what I been saying?
He's just the best candidate.

48:38.482 --> 48:41.110
- So you'll go with my man?
- I'll think about it.

48:41.151 --> 48:43.085
All right, that's great.
Thank you for your time.

48:43.120 --> 48:45.350
- Goodbye.
- All right.

48:55.165 --> 48:58.032
- I have a hall pass.
- Yeah, good for you.

49:41.111 --> 49:44.239
- Mine's down.
- Attaboy.

49:46.083 --> 49:50.076
You need bodies, Lester?
Here you go.

49:52.289 --> 49:56.692
We got a warrant and a teletype
for my boy Lex.

49:56.727 --> 50:00.060
So dead or alive, he's on file.

50:00.097 --> 50:02.156
And beyond that,
it's time for you to shine

50:02.199 --> 50:04.429
that mighty intellect of yours

50:04.468 --> 50:05.992
on some real murders, hmm?

50:06.036 --> 50:08.937
Give up the hypotheticals
and shit.

50:08.972 --> 50:11.372
Yeah, I suppose.

50:13.310 --> 50:15.540
This is my issue... crime,

50:15.579 --> 50:17.672
and I understand completely
what you're saying.

50:17.714 --> 50:20.581
And if you give me the opportunity,
I will be able to do something to...

50:20.617 --> 50:23.381
to help you out and, you know,
other people in this neighborhood.

50:26.957 --> 50:30.051
Mr. Ricks,
thank you for your time

50:30.093 --> 50:31.685
- and for your attention.
- No problem.

50:31.728 --> 50:34.196
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

50:34.231 --> 50:37.325
Pretty brazen, shaking hands
with the enemy in broad daylight.

50:37.367 --> 50:41.394
- Werner's Deli this isn't.
- Definitely not.

50:41.438 --> 50:43.963
Though here you are, Councilman,
leaving no door unopened.

50:44.007 --> 50:45.838
Shoe leather...
our secret weapon.

50:45.876 --> 50:48.242
You surprised me.
You've made this a horse race.

50:48.278 --> 50:51.839
So uh, what makes me think you didn't
just happen by and find us here?

50:54.751 --> 50:56.946
Watkins is breaking
with the mayor.

50:56.987 --> 50:59.285
How do you know?

50:59.322 --> 51:03.258
I know. I've carried the mayor's water
because I had to, Councilman.

51:03.293 --> 51:05.761
I'd love to see some new blood
in this city.

51:05.796 --> 51:08.196
And I'd love the chance
to do the right thing

51:08.231 --> 51:10.563
for this police department
for a change.

51:29.686 --> 51:31.677
Wait until he turns
the corner.

51:34.758 --> 51:37.192
District office for Watkins...

51:37.227 --> 51:38.854
Gilmore Street.

51:38.895 --> 51:40.863
And fuck
them red lights, man.

51:47.170 --> 51:51.334
Not a place you expect
to find any gangsters...

51:51.374 --> 51:54.673
police, for that matter.

51:54.711 --> 51:58.613
- Heard you knew something I didn't.
- Told you before...

51:58.648 --> 52:01.412
I make it my business
to keep an ear to the ground.

52:01.451 --> 52:03.612
I make it my business
to do business.

52:03.653 --> 52:05.985
We doing business,
or are we just talking?

52:06.022 --> 52:07.683
And if it's talk,
I'ma walk.

52:07.724 --> 52:10.124
I heard the people pulling
security at the card game

52:10.160 --> 52:12.651
weren't too keen
on their wages.

52:12.696 --> 52:14.664
I figured it was
only a matter of time

52:14.698 --> 52:17.565
before they found a way
to get their due compensation.

52:17.601 --> 52:19.501
And you didn't think
to tell me?

52:19.536 --> 52:22.334
A man learns best
when he get burned.

52:22.372 --> 52:25.535
How do I know you ain't
making this shit up?

52:25.575 --> 52:28.635
You don't.
Things happen on the street.

52:28.678 --> 52:31.545
Proof is hard to come by.

52:34.918 --> 52:37.682
Go ahead, open it.

52:42.292 --> 52:43.691
Off the street,

52:43.727 --> 52:45.456
there's all kind of proof.

52:45.495 --> 52:48.521
They planning on executing
those Friday...

52:48.565 --> 52:50.533
time it with the election,
I guess,

52:50.567 --> 52:53.434
show they doing their job,
cleaning up the city,

52:53.470 --> 52:55.631
taking down a kingpin.

52:55.672 --> 52:58.106
- How did you come by this?
- Told you before...

52:58.141 --> 53:00.439
I keep my ear
to the ground.

53:00.477 --> 53:02.945
- What are you gonna do with it?
- Maybe nothing.

53:02.979 --> 53:05.777
Charlie's not part
of the co-op.

53:07.450 --> 53:09.384
Or maybe
I tip him for a fee.

53:09.419 --> 53:13.321
What do you think a man
with a whole lot of money

53:13.356 --> 53:16.655
would pay
for his freedom?

53:17.727 --> 53:20.787
You know, lately

53:20.830 --> 53:23.526
I come to find out someone trying
to take pictures of me.

53:23.567 --> 53:25.398
Pictures?

53:25.435 --> 53:27.198
Video.

53:27.237 --> 53:30.866
You heard anything about me
through your travels?

53:30.907 --> 53:33.034
Had no incentive to listen.

53:36.112 --> 53:37.977
You do now.

53:53.096 --> 53:54.961
It's one thing
to sit out the primary.

53:54.998 --> 53:56.727
It's another

53:56.766 --> 53:58.996
for me to turn
on Clarence Royce.

53:59.035 --> 54:01.629
- Granted.
- And if I did jump,

54:01.671 --> 54:04.435
why not land
behind Tony Gray?

54:04.474 --> 54:06.738
At least he's from
my side of the tracks.

54:06.776 --> 54:09.939
Tony can't win. I can.

54:11.581 --> 54:13.208
Look, the truth is,

54:13.250 --> 54:16.310
whatever I can do for you,
the mayor can match or double.

54:16.353 --> 54:18.583
I have a pretty good
grass-roots organization,

54:18.622 --> 54:20.613
but nothing even close
to his kind of money.

54:20.657 --> 54:23.217
Now, I'll ticket up
with anyone you want me to.

54:23.260 --> 54:26.525
I know you want Daniels in the 11th
and Stokes in the 10th.

54:26.563 --> 54:29.259
I'll keep away from any tickets
you think I might harm.

54:29.299 --> 54:32.462
I know I'm not everyone's idea
of a bargain on your side of town.

54:32.502 --> 54:34.800
- Hmm.
- But right now,

54:34.838 --> 54:36.829
a week from the primary,

54:36.873 --> 54:40.468
the fact is,
Royce and I both need you.

54:40.510 --> 54:44.810
After the election, the equation changes
for him but not for me.

54:44.848 --> 54:47.874
I'm a white mayor
in a majority-black city,

54:47.917 --> 54:49.885
and if I'm gonna
do anything...

54:49.919 --> 54:52.444
and, Delegate, I am so serious
about fixing this city...

54:52.489 --> 54:54.480
I'm gonna have to govern
by consensus.

54:54.524 --> 54:57.322
And if you support me, you will have
a voice within my administration

54:57.360 --> 54:59.920
simply because
I'm gonna need it.

55:02.465 --> 55:05.434
Last poll that
Clarence showed me,

55:05.468 --> 55:07.129
he was up
by seven points.

55:08.438 --> 55:11.601
Bullshit.
I'm within four.

55:16.813 --> 55:20.214
- You won't be needing that.
- I know.

55:22.218 --> 55:24.948
- Here?
- Yeah, here.

56:02.058 --> 56:04.390
Dag.

56:04.427 --> 56:06.395
Yo, turn it off... the bulb
might have got too hot.
