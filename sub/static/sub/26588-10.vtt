Dre: Some days it's
like you can guess

00:31.500 --> 00:33.250
exactly where you're going...

00:33.250 --> 00:35.960
Coffee,
my half-Nubian queen?

00:35.960 --> 00:41.670
Oh, well, thank you so much,
my hobo-bearded king.

00:41.670 --> 00:42.830
Jack: Mo-ooom! Da-aaad!

00:42.830 --> 00:44.380
Ah, here we go.

00:44.380 --> 00:45.710
What do you think
he forgot this time?

00:45.710 --> 00:47.670
Field trip.

00:47.670 --> 00:50.420
And I bet you
the rest of this creamer

00:50.420 --> 00:52.420
that he wants
one of us to chaperone.

00:53.790 --> 00:55.540
I'll take that action.
Bet.

00:55.540 --> 00:56.620
Okay,
so I need one of you guys

00:56.620 --> 00:57.920
to pay for my class picture,
okay?

00:57.920 --> 00:59.710
You can do
cash, credit, Venmo...
Damn it.

00:59.710 --> 01:01.540
And, Mom,
you can write a check.

01:01.540 --> 01:02.460
Dad, you cannot.

01:02.460 --> 01:03.750
Ha!

01:03.750 --> 01:04.880
Thank you.

01:04.880 --> 01:06.460
And also,
we only have 42 minutes

01:06.460 --> 01:08.380
to get to school
on time, so...

01:08.380 --> 01:09.330
You do realize
once you get there,

01:09.330 --> 01:11.000
you still
will be at school.
Dre.

01:11.000 --> 01:12.540
I understand,

01:12.540 --> 01:14.500
but I've had perfect attendance
all semester,

01:14.500 --> 01:16.170
and if I get on time today,

01:16.170 --> 01:17.960
I'll get
my first certificate.

01:17.960 --> 01:19.380
'Cause I need
something positive

01:19.380 --> 01:21.040
for them
to put in the yearbook.

01:21.040 --> 01:24.420
All they have right now is --
Jack Johnson, tries.

01:24.420 --> 01:25.830
Aw. Well, that's nice.
Okay, buddy.

01:25.830 --> 01:27.580
All right, all right,
I will get you to school.

01:27.580 --> 01:29.920
Aw, look how
cute you are.

01:29.920 --> 01:31.830
Thank you so much
for not holding

01:31.830 --> 01:33.460
the invisible guns
this year.

01:33.460 --> 01:34.880
I forgot.

01:34.880 --> 01:37.080
Where's Diane?

01:37.080 --> 01:38.620
What?
Right there.

01:40.330 --> 01:42.830
Oh, my God.

01:42.830 --> 01:45.670
What's wrong, babe?

01:45.670 --> 01:47.620
Yeah, that's Diane.

01:47.620 --> 01:49.380
Oh, my God!

01:49.380 --> 01:51.170
And other days,

01:51.170 --> 01:53.750
you never could've guessed
where you'd end up.

01:53.750 --> 01:55.750
They O.J.'d my baby!

02:00.290 --> 02:01.580
Principal Biggs?

02:01.580 --> 02:03.580
Uh, y-yes...

02:03.580 --> 02:06.210
Yes, I am calling
from a landline

02:06.210 --> 02:08.210
because this is
very serious.

02:08.210 --> 02:12.420
My daughter was not lit properly
in the class photo.

02:12.420 --> 02:13.880
And someone decided
to print it anyway.

02:13.880 --> 02:15.460
Yeah,
it's gonna be a fight!

02:15.460 --> 02:18.080
All right, let me give
you a little context.

02:18.080 --> 02:20.290
Black people come
in many shades,

02:20.290 --> 02:23.580
from Mariah Carey
to Wesley Snipes.

02:23.580 --> 02:25.540
Because we look different,

02:25.540 --> 02:27.790
we get discriminated
against differently.

02:27.790 --> 02:29.380
Like in the case of O.J.

02:29.380 --> 02:32.120
A magazine made his skin
look darker

02:32.120 --> 02:34.620
to make him seem
more villainous.

02:34.620 --> 02:36.250
And sadly, it's not
just done to us.

02:36.250 --> 02:37.580
Like with the

02:37.580 --> 02:40.500
"Are You Darker Than
a Brown Paper Bag Test."

02:40.500 --> 02:43.540
Sometimes we even discriminate
against each other.

02:43.540 --> 02:45.710
It's called "colorism" --

02:45.710 --> 02:48.710
the racist belief that
lightskin is good

02:48.710 --> 02:50.540
and darkskin is bad.

02:50.540 --> 02:52.420
But it's not just us.

02:52.420 --> 02:56.040
People are color-struck
all around the world...

02:56.040 --> 02:57.830
In Asian communities,

02:57.830 --> 03:02.250
some people use umbrellas
and visors to avoid the sun.

03:02.250 --> 03:05.210
In Indian communities,
some dark-skinned actors

03:05.210 --> 03:08.830
say they have trouble starring
even in Bollywood movies.

03:08.830 --> 03:10.750
And in the Latin community,

03:10.750 --> 03:13.120
products that bleach your skin

03:13.120 --> 03:15.460
are becoming increasingly
popular.

03:15.460 --> 03:17.460
But with Black Americans,

03:17.460 --> 03:20.170
people believe colorism
was the brainchild

03:20.170 --> 03:22.080
of a slave owner
named Willie Lynch

03:22.080 --> 03:24.210
who taught other slave owners

03:24.210 --> 03:27.750
how to control us
by dividing us by color.

03:27.750 --> 03:31.620
Turns out, the story of
Willie Lynch is a hoax.

03:31.620 --> 03:34.830
But it felt real because of
the fact that slave owners

03:34.830 --> 03:36.790
did divide us by color,

03:36.790 --> 03:38.960
putting dark slaves
in the field

03:38.960 --> 03:41.620
and light slaves in the house.

03:41.620 --> 03:44.920
This separation caused
deep-seated tension

03:44.920 --> 03:47.960
and resentment that continues
to this day.

03:47.960 --> 03:49.500
The resentment is so great

03:49.500 --> 03:51.080
that it makes us
hyper-sensitive

03:51.080 --> 03:52.500
to issues of complexion.

03:52.500 --> 03:54.500
Which brings us back to this...

03:54.500 --> 03:55.920
It's gonna be a fight!

03:55.920 --> 03:57.620
Yeah, we are coming in there
to see you this morning.

03:57.620 --> 03:59.830
Mm-hmm, a real cat fight!

03:59.830 --> 04:01.210
Yeah, uh-huh...

04:01.210 --> 04:04.170
Like, immediately
after drop-off,

04:04.170 --> 04:05.580
we are coming
to your office.

04:05.580 --> 04:07.500
Mm-hmm, I'm talking about
hair wrapped, earrings out,

04:07.500 --> 04:09.330
Vaseline
on your face fight!
Okay. Okay.

04:09.330 --> 04:11.080
Uh-huh.
We will see you then.

04:11.080 --> 04:12.670
Thank you.
Mm-hmm.

04:12.670 --> 04:13.960
Unbelievable.

04:13.960 --> 04:15.920
You got this, Bow.
You got this.

04:15.920 --> 04:17.170
You can get her.

04:17.170 --> 04:18.580
You can take her.

04:18.580 --> 04:20.540
I'm not fighting
the principal, Dre.
Why not?

04:20.540 --> 04:22.250
-What?
-Hey, what's going on here?

04:22.250 --> 04:24.420
D-- I...
This.

04:24.420 --> 04:26.380
So when is Rainbow gonna
fight the principal?

04:26.380 --> 04:27.580
That's what I'm talking about!
What is wrong with --

04:27.580 --> 04:30.500
Whup my ass!
What is wrong with you guys?

04:30.500 --> 04:31.620
Diane!

04:32.830 --> 04:34.250
Honestly, Mama...

04:36.710 --> 04:38.170
How are you doing?

04:38.170 --> 04:40.670
Mother,
why are you touching me?

04:43.170 --> 04:45.000
We saw your class photo.

04:45.000 --> 04:46.620
Oh, that?
Yeah.

04:46.620 --> 04:47.920
Eh, it's no big deal.

04:47.920 --> 04:48.790
Yes, it is.
Dre: Yeah.

04:48.790 --> 04:50.040
Yes, it is.

04:50.040 --> 04:51.880
Sweetheart, it is not okay

04:51.880 --> 04:54.040
for them to light you
like this.

04:54.040 --> 04:56.420
They need to be more sensitive
to all complexions.

04:56.420 --> 04:57.790
-Mm-hmm.
-Mm-hmm.

04:57.790 --> 04:59.460
And we're gonna go and talk
to them about this.

04:59.460 --> 05:01.620
Yes, your mother gonna
beat up the principal.
No, I'm not.

05:01.620 --> 05:02.620
No, you're not.

05:02.620 --> 05:03.710
But you're gonna
try your best.

05:03.710 --> 05:05.000
I'm proud of you, baby.

05:05.000 --> 05:06.290
You guys don't have
to do this.

05:06.290 --> 05:08.040
Everybody takes
bad pictures.

05:08.040 --> 05:09.620
Yeah, especially
Dad in the '90s.

05:11.830 --> 05:14.420
Do y'all know how hard
it is to lean on a cane?

05:14.420 --> 05:16.460
Oh, my God.
Huh? Do you?

05:16.460 --> 05:19.040
Okay, well, the point is
we have less than 40 minutes

05:19.040 --> 05:20.500
to get to school on time.

05:20.500 --> 05:21.710
Yes, and we are gonna
get you there.

05:21.710 --> 05:23.170
And when we do,

05:23.170 --> 05:26.120
we are going to explain
to Principal Biggs

05:26.120 --> 05:28.880
that this
is thoughtless and hurtful.

05:28.880 --> 05:30.670
And we are gonna demand

05:30.670 --> 05:33.540
that she retake this photo
with proper lighting.

05:33.540 --> 05:34.580
No...

05:34.580 --> 05:35.960
we're gonna go in
there screaming

05:35.960 --> 05:37.540
how racist they are

05:37.540 --> 05:39.710
and get free pictures
for the rest of our lives.

05:39.710 --> 05:41.420
And then I'm gonna ask
for some Kanye tickets.

05:41.420 --> 05:43.710
-Kanye?
-I really want to see him,

05:43.710 --> 05:46.040
but I will never ever give
that man any more of my money.

05:46.040 --> 05:47.790
We have no idea if
this was intentional.

05:47.790 --> 05:49.080
We can't just
walk into Valley Glen

05:49.080 --> 05:50.670
yelling about racism.

05:50.670 --> 05:53.080
It can't always be
peaceful, Bow.

05:53.080 --> 05:54.880
Sometimes you need
a Ferguson.

05:54.880 --> 05:56.210
We don't need either.

05:56.210 --> 05:58.830
I honestly think the
photographer just messed up.

05:58.830 --> 06:00.380
So can we please
just drop this?

06:00.380 --> 06:02.670
This is nothing
to be ashamed of.

06:02.670 --> 06:04.290
And I know this
is uncomfortable,

06:04.290 --> 06:05.500
but you have to
trust us, okay?

06:05.500 --> 06:06.830
We're gonna figure
this out...

06:06.830 --> 06:10.040
...together,
as a family, okay?

06:10.040 --> 06:12.290
Whoo! Morning.

06:12.290 --> 06:15.040
Do I have time to get a smoothie
before work?

06:15.040 --> 06:16.040
Uh, we're gonna be late.

06:16.040 --> 06:17.710
We got to go to the school

06:17.710 --> 06:19.960
because Diane has had her
first issues with complexion.

06:19.960 --> 06:21.250
Mm.

06:21.250 --> 06:23.880
So a yes on the smoothie.

06:23.880 --> 06:24.920
Thank you, bigotry.

06:24.920 --> 06:25.960
Junior.

06:25.960 --> 06:27.830
But, hey, don't worry.

06:27.830 --> 06:30.120
If you can handle
our family's issues
with complexion,

06:30.120 --> 06:33.000
then you can handle
anybody else's.
What issues?

06:33.000 --> 06:34.960
If you're wondering
why this feels

06:34.960 --> 06:37.330
like an accident
about to happen,

06:37.330 --> 06:41.330
it's because colorism is
something Black families

06:41.330 --> 06:43.080
really don't like
to talk about.

06:43.080 --> 06:44.920
I just meant she'll
get used to it.

06:44.920 --> 06:46.920
You know, since we're
all colorists.

06:46.920 --> 06:49.420
Whoa.
I mean, especially Dad.

06:50.790 --> 06:52.620
What the hell
are you saying?

06:52.620 --> 06:54.540
Oh, uh, my bad.

06:54.540 --> 06:57.460
Did you guys want to be the ones
to break it to her?

06:58.750 --> 06:59.710
Rainbow: Junior.

07:04.170 --> 07:05.540
What are you
talking about?

07:05.540 --> 07:07.330
Yeah,
we're not colorists.

07:07.330 --> 07:10.250
Oh, oh, s-so that's what
we're doing here?

07:10.250 --> 07:12.250
Oh, my bad, yeah.

07:12.250 --> 07:16.250
This family willingly accepts
Black people of all shades.

07:16.250 --> 07:18.170
You sound stupid.

07:18.170 --> 07:20.120
You think we treat Diane
the same way the school does?

07:20.120 --> 07:22.250
No one is saying that.

07:22.250 --> 07:24.330
Can we just forget
about all this?

07:24.330 --> 07:26.710
Yeah, I don't think is gonna
help me get to school on time.

07:26.710 --> 07:28.380
Look, I just meant
that sometimes

07:28.380 --> 07:29.960
the lightskin people
in this family

07:29.960 --> 07:31.040
get treated badly.

07:31.040 --> 07:32.710
That's what you meant?

07:32.710 --> 07:35.960
But you know, baby,
lightskins don't have problems.

07:35.960 --> 07:38.290
Or course fair-skinned people
have problems.

07:38.290 --> 07:41.080
Yeah, but it's the same way
rich people have problems.

07:41.080 --> 07:42.580
What?

07:42.580 --> 07:46.170
Oh no, I can't fit all
my money in my pocket.

07:46.170 --> 07:49.460
Heavens, the butler is sick.

07:49.460 --> 07:54.790
Who will apply my SPF-162
to my translucent fair skin?

07:54.790 --> 07:56.210
Rainbow: Setting
a very good example, Dre,

07:56.210 --> 07:57.250
with all these jokes.

07:57.250 --> 07:58.620
That's really good.
No, they liked it.

07:58.620 --> 08:01.120
This is what happens every time
we talk about this.

08:01.120 --> 08:02.540
We get jokes.

08:02.540 --> 08:04.380
Calm down, Team Lightskin.
It's all right.

08:04.380 --> 08:05.830
Yeah, it's just jokes.
Thank you, Mama.

08:05.830 --> 08:08.330
That you guys constantly
do all the time.

08:08.330 --> 08:11.250
Team Lightskin.
Or half-Nubian queen.

08:11.250 --> 08:13.830
Or "Oh, you guys come
from Lightskinsylvania."

08:13.830 --> 08:16.710
Don't you?
Or me looking like
Raven-Symoné with a fade.

08:16.710 --> 08:19.500
Guys, come on.
We're talking about jokes.

08:19.500 --> 08:21.750
Not oppression. Jokes.

08:21.750 --> 08:23.330
Well, if it's so
harmless, Dre,

08:23.330 --> 08:25.920
then would you mind
if Junior and I

08:25.920 --> 08:27.750
just start making a
couple darkskin jokes?

08:27.750 --> 08:29.210
Come on.
Yeah, a darkskin
guy walks --

08:29.210 --> 08:31.170
I dare you.
Mm-hmm. Guys, go up.

08:31.170 --> 08:32.620
Finish getting ready.
You can go now.

08:32.620 --> 08:34.750
Go ahead.
Get out of here.

08:34.750 --> 08:36.500
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey,
wh-- what are you doing?

08:36.500 --> 08:38.170
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
We --
We were just talking.

08:38.170 --> 08:39.540
Oh, we're just talking?
Yes.

08:39.540 --> 08:42.670
Well, I do not want them
learning about colorism

08:42.670 --> 08:43.790
through a whole bunch
of ignorant jokes.

08:43.790 --> 08:45.250
You know what?

08:45.250 --> 08:47.500
You can act like you're hurt
if you want to, Rainbow,

08:47.500 --> 08:49.920
but if you get to complain
about a few jokes,

08:49.920 --> 08:53.500
I get to complain
about how lightskin

08:53.500 --> 08:55.210
is the Black standard
of beauty.

08:56.210 --> 08:58.210
Who do women
with deeper skin tones

08:58.210 --> 08:59.880
have to look up to, huh?

08:59.880 --> 09:01.330
Um, Lupita.

09:01.330 --> 09:02.460
Yeah, name another one.

09:05.170 --> 09:06.380
Nyong'o.

09:06.380 --> 09:08.420
Okay, see? See? See?
Sit down.

09:08.420 --> 09:10.500
Yeah, great list.

09:10.500 --> 09:12.620
Let me help you out --
Tika Sumpter...

09:12.620 --> 09:14.210
Mm-hmm.
...Viola Davis...

09:14.210 --> 09:17.210
Ooh, yeah.
...and that beautiful
bald-headed lady

09:17.210 --> 09:19.330
from "Black Panther"...
Danai Gurira?

09:19.330 --> 09:22.580
Yeah. But Lupita's
on all the magazines

09:22.580 --> 09:26.170
because they only choose
one darkskin woman

09:26.170 --> 09:28.380
to celebrate
every 10 years.

09:28.380 --> 09:30.540
I'm not saying that's okay,
because it's not.

09:30.540 --> 09:33.750
But I did not choose to
be born with fairer skin.

09:33.750 --> 09:36.580
Still, people act like
we created the problem.

09:36.580 --> 09:39.420
That's why we can't tell jokes
but you can.

09:39.420 --> 09:41.500
It's like you're saying
we're not really Black.

09:41.500 --> 09:43.170
Look at this.

09:43.170 --> 09:45.460
The lion
is king of the jungle,

09:45.460 --> 09:48.710
but when he's lightskinned,
his mane is flat-ironed.

09:48.710 --> 09:50.080
And he sings.

09:50.080 --> 09:53.080
Not to mention all of
the "Drake be like" jokes.

09:53.080 --> 09:54.330
Okay, look here, man.

09:54.330 --> 09:57.120
Drake jokes
are not lightskin jokes.

09:57.120 --> 09:58.750
Of course they are.

09:58.750 --> 10:00.920
You're saying he's soft
because he's lightskinned.

10:00.920 --> 10:02.000
No, I'm saying he's soft

10:02.000 --> 10:03.920
because he pees
with his pinky out.

10:03.920 --> 10:05.960
It's like you can't
even help yourself.

10:05.960 --> 10:07.960
Let me tell you this --

10:07.960 --> 10:12.500
I'd gladly trade a few jokes
for lightskin privilege.

10:12.500 --> 10:13.830
Oh, mm-hmm.

10:13.830 --> 10:15.830
I have worked for everything
that I have.

10:15.830 --> 10:18.170
Okay, so you're
saying white people

10:18.170 --> 10:19.420
don't have white privilege?

10:19.420 --> 10:21.460
Of course white people
have white privilege.

10:21.460 --> 10:23.000
Okay, then why can't
lightskinned people

10:23.000 --> 10:24.420
have lightskin privilege?

10:24.420 --> 10:26.330
Because, Dre,
we're still Black.

10:26.330 --> 10:27.330
In what community?

10:27.330 --> 10:28.880
When I walk down
the street,

10:28.880 --> 10:31.040
people don't see my privilege.

10:31.040 --> 10:32.880
They see a Black woman.

10:32.880 --> 10:33.880
A tan woman.

10:33.880 --> 10:35.580
I'm not tan, Ruby.

10:35.580 --> 10:37.750
Okay, guys, guys,
I'm gonna call this, okay?

10:37.750 --> 10:39.460
Because we are
not about to solve

10:39.460 --> 10:41.710
a few hundred years
of colorism today,

10:41.710 --> 10:42.790
all right?
Mm.

10:42.790 --> 10:44.540
So let's just agree
to disagree.

10:44.540 --> 10:46.250
I agree to disagree.

10:46.250 --> 10:48.500
Yeah, you should probably
get Jack to school, Dad.

10:48.500 --> 10:51.460
Because clearly we are
not gonna fix you guys

10:51.460 --> 10:53.000
in one conversation.

10:54.040 --> 10:55.580
Fix us?

10:58.750 --> 11:00.380
Hey, homie?

11:00.380 --> 11:02.380
That was crazy back there,
right?

11:02.380 --> 11:04.540
Yeah.
That was pretty intense.

11:04.540 --> 11:05.710
I know, man.

11:05.710 --> 11:07.460
One silly little comment
about us being colorist

11:07.460 --> 11:09.380
and then the ladies,
they start tripping.

11:09.380 --> 11:10.830
Right.

11:10.830 --> 11:13.210
You know, but...you and me,
we're cool.

11:13.210 --> 11:14.920
Because I know
you didn't really mean

11:14.920 --> 11:16.790
those things
you said back there.

11:16.790 --> 11:18.500
No,
I meant what I said.

11:18.500 --> 11:20.120
Hey, man,
I'm not a colorist.

11:20.120 --> 11:21.670
I love lightskinned people.

11:21.670 --> 11:23.580
Yeah, you love
lightskinned women,

11:23.580 --> 11:25.710
but you think lightskinned dudes
are soft.

11:25.710 --> 11:28.170
No, I just think
you're soft.
But Jack's not?

11:28.170 --> 11:30.830
A guy who dances
and collects flowers

11:30.830 --> 11:32.620
on the field
during his soccer game?

11:32.620 --> 11:34.080
I did do that.

11:34.080 --> 11:35.580
Oh, and uh... hey, Dad...
Hmm?

11:35.580 --> 11:37.500
...I think I invented
a dance move.

11:38.830 --> 11:40.080
Ah.

11:40.080 --> 11:41.670
That's not soft?

11:41.670 --> 11:42.750
That's just Jack.

11:42.750 --> 11:43.960
That's just me.

11:43.960 --> 11:46.000
Okay,
that's Perfect Attendance Jack.

11:46.000 --> 11:47.120
Meet you in the garage?

11:47.120 --> 11:48.750
Mm-hmm.

11:48.750 --> 11:50.170
You see?

11:50.170 --> 11:51.290
I don't treat you
any differently

11:51.290 --> 11:52.380
because of your complexion.

11:52.380 --> 11:53.710
Whatever, man.

11:57.170 --> 11:58.920
Okay.
Hey, hey, hey.

11:58.920 --> 12:02.120
"Whatever" is what people say
when they're wrong.

12:02.120 --> 12:04.040
No, "whatever"
is what people say

12:04.040 --> 12:06.210
when they're done with
a ridiculous conversation.

12:06.210 --> 12:07.710
Hey, hey, hey, man.
Where you going?

12:07.710 --> 12:09.420
I'm not done agreeing
to disagree.

12:09.420 --> 12:10.750
I thought you said
we were dropping this.

12:10.750 --> 12:12.710
I thought you said you're
gonna take me to school.

12:12.710 --> 12:15.120
No one's gonna care if
I'm lightskin or darkskin.

12:15.120 --> 12:16.420
They're just gonna
care if I'm late.

12:16.420 --> 12:17.750
Okay.
Whatever, Jack.

12:17.750 --> 12:19.170
Ruby: Hey, hey, hey.

12:19.170 --> 12:21.040
What's everybody
hollering about?

12:21.040 --> 12:24.460
Are the lightskins crying
beige tears again?

12:24.460 --> 12:26.250
God, can you just stop?

12:26.250 --> 12:27.460
I go out in the world,

12:27.460 --> 12:28.920
and I have to deal
with everything

12:28.920 --> 12:29.960
that comes with being Black,

12:29.960 --> 12:31.080
and then I come home,

12:31.080 --> 12:33.170
and I got to deal
with your jokes.

12:33.170 --> 12:34.830
It's like I have
no safe place to be.

12:34.830 --> 12:37.540
You think you're the only ones
fighting two battles?

12:37.540 --> 12:40.460
Darkskin people have been
picked on by white people

12:40.460 --> 12:44.000
and lightskin people ever
since they brought us here.

12:44.000 --> 12:45.540
So you're gonna blame me

12:45.540 --> 12:46.790
for something I had nothing
to do with?

12:46.790 --> 12:49.250
Babe, that is literally

12:49.250 --> 12:51.210
the same thing white people
say about slavery.

12:51.210 --> 12:52.380
Mm.
You're right.
You're right about that.

12:52.380 --> 12:54.750
You think you're
so much better?

12:54.750 --> 12:57.830
"I'm not a colorist because
I've got a lightskin wife"?

12:57.830 --> 12:59.250
Uh, hello, police?

12:59.250 --> 13:01.500
Yeah, if I told you I had
information on a crime,

13:01.500 --> 13:03.500
would you come take me
and my sister to school?

13:03.500 --> 13:04.920
Hey, want them to come?

13:04.920 --> 13:06.580
Tell them we know where
to find a missing white girl.

13:06.580 --> 13:07.710
Oh. Yeah.

13:07.710 --> 13:09.040
Guys, what are we
even arguing about?

13:09.040 --> 13:10.170
Okay.

13:10.170 --> 13:12.080
Lightskin people
have it better.

13:12.080 --> 13:13.380
I'm sorry.
You just do.

13:13.380 --> 13:15.040
Next time
I get pulled over,

13:15.040 --> 13:16.420
I'll make sure to tell
the officer that.

13:16.420 --> 13:18.960
You've never
been pulled over.

13:18.960 --> 13:20.920
I've gotten some glares
from bike cops.

13:20.920 --> 13:22.290
So maybe now
we can stop pretending

13:22.290 --> 13:23.920
that you don't
earn more than us?

13:23.920 --> 13:25.750
Or maybe
that you don't get something

13:25.750 --> 13:28.710
like 12% less time
in jail?

13:28.710 --> 13:30.670
No one's saying
that's not true,

13:30.670 --> 13:32.580
but that's not what
this is about.

13:32.580 --> 13:35.500
This is about looking
at damn near every movie,

13:35.500 --> 13:37.420
magazine,
and television show

13:37.420 --> 13:40.040
and only seeing a lighter
version of yourself.

13:40.040 --> 13:41.420
Ooh.
Are you happy for them?

13:41.420 --> 13:42.750
Yes.

13:42.750 --> 13:44.960
But God forbid
you say you feel left out,

13:44.960 --> 13:46.960
and you're called
a crab in a barrel.

13:46.960 --> 13:49.880
The only time I see
a darkskin person on TV

13:49.880 --> 13:51.170
is when the news says

13:51.170 --> 13:53.120
the police have murdered
another one of us!

13:53.120 --> 13:55.460
Thank you.

13:55.460 --> 13:57.420
Since when did you
become darkskin?

13:59.420 --> 14:02.790
I'm not dark-dark,
but, uh, I'm dark enough.

14:02.790 --> 14:04.330
Not as dark as me.
Oh.

14:04.330 --> 14:07.120
No one in this family
is as dark as me.

14:07.120 --> 14:08.290
That's the problem.

14:08.290 --> 14:10.250
That's not a problem.

14:10.250 --> 14:12.830
The fact that you're different
is a good thing.
Mm-hmm.

14:12.830 --> 14:14.500
If it's so good,

14:14.500 --> 14:17.420
then why are you all so scared
to talk about it?

14:17.420 --> 14:18.620
Like today.

14:18.620 --> 14:20.080
You're saying
that it's about

14:20.080 --> 14:21.960
"the camera lighting"
or "complexion."

14:21.960 --> 14:24.580
No, it's about me
being darker.

14:24.580 --> 14:27.500
Well, it's, uh,
a complicated issue,

14:27.500 --> 14:31.750
but, Diane,
all Black skin is beautiful.

14:31.750 --> 14:32.790
-Yes.
-Mm-hmm.

14:32.790 --> 14:34.420
Okay.

14:34.420 --> 14:36.500
So then why do people
bleach their skin?

14:36.500 --> 14:38.750
How many people do that?

14:38.750 --> 14:40.710
It's like
a $10-billion business.

14:40.710 --> 14:43.210
-Oh.

14:43.210 --> 14:45.920
Diane, I had no idea that
this hurt you so much.

14:45.920 --> 14:46.830
How could it not?

14:53.120 --> 14:55.290
Diane:
It's everywhere I look.

14:55.290 --> 14:57.040
Oh, trust me.

14:57.040 --> 14:58.620
Women like us shouldn't
wear red lipstick.

14:58.620 --> 15:00.000
Try this one.

15:00.000 --> 15:02.670
It's everywhere I go.

15:02.670 --> 15:04.540
Oh, look at you.

15:04.540 --> 15:06.580
You are gorgeous for
a darkskin girl.

15:07.830 --> 15:09.120
It's everyone I talk to.

15:09.120 --> 15:11.080
Sweetheart.

15:11.080 --> 15:13.620
You see,
now you feel bad for me!

15:15.000 --> 15:16.620
This is why I didn't
want to talk about it.

15:18.920 --> 15:21.040
I just don't want
to be different!

15:24.120 --> 15:25.460
I'll --
I'll go talk to her.
Okay.

15:25.460 --> 15:26.960
Hey, Rainbow, Rainbow.

15:26.960 --> 15:28.380
Let me talk to her.

15:28.380 --> 15:29.620
Excuse me?

15:29.620 --> 15:31.040
I can connect
with her on this.

15:32.250 --> 15:34.460
Oh, and I can't?

15:34.460 --> 15:36.210
Why?
Because I'm lightskinned,

15:36.210 --> 15:37.790
you don't think I can
understand my daughter?

15:37.790 --> 15:39.620
What is wrong with you?

15:39.620 --> 15:41.500
Now, you know
that's not what I meant.
O--

15:41.500 --> 15:44.000
But if it struck
a nerve...

15:44.000 --> 15:45.330
Ladies,
let's not do this.

15:45.330 --> 15:46.710
Let's not do what?!
...all morning!

15:46.710 --> 15:48.580
Ruby, every --
You're wrong for that,
Rainbow!

15:48.580 --> 15:51.170
I'm wrong for that?!
Yes, you're wrong for that,
Rainbow!

15:51.170 --> 15:53.250
Oh, my God.
Over here telling me

15:53.250 --> 15:55.170
I can't go talk
to my grandbaby.

15:55.170 --> 15:57.170
You told me.
No, no, no, as if color

15:57.170 --> 15:59.500
had anything to do with
what I was talking about!

15:59.500 --> 16:00.960
I don't need to know
what you were talking about

16:00.960 --> 16:02.380
because you're always
saying the same thing!

16:02.380 --> 16:03.170
You've been saying
it all morning!

16:03.170 --> 16:04.080
That's what
I'm talking about!

16:04.080 --> 16:06.420
You say to me
you're better than me!

16:06.420 --> 16:08.920
That you're Blacker than me!
Ooh, and I have no struggle!

16:08.920 --> 16:11.080
Seriously?!

16:11.080 --> 16:12.960
My struggle is you, Ruby.

16:12.960 --> 16:14.080
You're a monster.

16:14.080 --> 16:15.920
I am not a monster!

16:18.460 --> 16:21.580
I've been called that
all my life,

16:21.580 --> 16:24.790
and I'm not about to sit here
and let you do it.

16:26.830 --> 16:28.920
Oh...

16:28.920 --> 16:30.710
What just happened?

16:35.170 --> 16:36.330
Dre:
I guess you can see why

16:36.330 --> 16:38.500
we don't talk about colorism.

16:38.500 --> 16:41.500
Because after generations
of pain and hurt feelings,

16:41.500 --> 16:44.790
talking about it
never goes well.

16:44.790 --> 16:47.580
Guys.

16:47.580 --> 16:49.290
I don't know
what happened back there.

16:50.920 --> 16:53.040
I'm sorry
you had to see that.

16:53.040 --> 16:54.750
That's not so bad.

16:54.750 --> 16:56.420
No one got shot.

16:56.420 --> 16:58.710
Okay.

17:02.080 --> 17:03.830
Ruby: Kids, I need you
to come look at this.

17:03.830 --> 17:05.920
Come on, baby.

17:05.920 --> 17:08.920
Come on.

17:08.920 --> 17:10.540
Okay.

17:10.540 --> 17:11.830
Here we go.

17:13.750 --> 17:16.460
Grandma, is that you?

17:16.460 --> 17:18.710
It sure is.

17:19.920 --> 17:22.330
I used to feel different,
too.

17:22.330 --> 17:25.580
You see, I was
the darkest one in my family

17:25.580 --> 17:29.080
because my people were Creoles
from Baton Rouge.

17:29.080 --> 17:30.830
They were all light enough

17:30.830 --> 17:33.500
to pass
the Brown Paper Bag Test.

17:33.500 --> 17:36.750
Well...

17:36.750 --> 17:39.250
until my mother
met my father.

17:41.710 --> 17:45.210
They were evil
to my father.

17:45.210 --> 17:48.250
And they were even
more evil to me.

17:49.250 --> 17:51.830
I wasn't allowed
in the front yard

17:51.830 --> 17:54.750
with my cousins.

17:54.750 --> 17:58.120
I had to play by myself
in the back

17:58.120 --> 18:01.120
so my dark skin
and my nappy hair

18:01.120 --> 18:03.540
couldn't embarrass
my lightskin family.

18:06.540 --> 18:09.120
I can still hear
their little nursery rhymes.

18:09.120 --> 18:12.000
"If you're light,
you're all right.

18:12.000 --> 18:14.670
If you're brown, stick around.

18:14.670 --> 18:18.080
If you're Black, get back.

18:18.080 --> 18:20.460
Get back.

18:20.460 --> 18:21.960
Get back."

18:25.540 --> 18:29.000
I was mad at them,
not you.

18:29.000 --> 18:31.080
And today I realized

18:31.080 --> 18:34.710
I have been hurting you
the same way they hurt me.

18:36.420 --> 18:41.710
I'm so...so sorry, Rainbow.

18:41.710 --> 18:45.540
You're an incredible
Black mother.

18:45.540 --> 18:46.880
Yeah.

18:49.170 --> 18:52.620
And I swear on everything
that I love...

18:52.620 --> 18:55.080
Come here.

18:55.080 --> 18:56.750
...I'm never gonna talk about

18:56.750 --> 18:58.210
your complexion again.

18:58.210 --> 18:59.540
Thank you, Ruby.

19:01.920 --> 19:04.790
I'm so, so sorry
that happened to you.

19:04.790 --> 19:07.920
Oh, I am, too.

19:07.920 --> 19:09.080
Thank you.

19:11.500 --> 19:13.290
Um, hey.

19:13.290 --> 19:16.830
Son, about before, man,
I --

19:16.830 --> 19:19.210
Y-- I-It's cool.

19:19.210 --> 19:21.670
I was so wrapped up
in my own thing

19:21.670 --> 19:25.080
that I forgot how hard it is
for you out there.

19:25.080 --> 19:27.000
It's still
not an excuse.

19:27.000 --> 19:32.670
You being you is not being soft,
and I'm sorry.

19:35.420 --> 19:39.750
Willie Lynch may not be real,
but he was real today.

19:39.750 --> 19:41.080
Oh, yeah.

19:41.080 --> 19:44.120
And we will not allow that
in our house anymore.

19:44.120 --> 19:46.080
Sounds good to me.

19:46.080 --> 19:48.170
So what's the hold-up?

19:48.170 --> 19:51.210
Are we gonna talk to
Ms. Biggs or what?

19:51.210 --> 19:52.540
Are you sure?

19:52.540 --> 19:53.880
Yeah.

19:53.880 --> 19:55.500
This morning was rough.

19:55.500 --> 19:57.460
Yeah.

19:57.460 --> 19:59.210
Yeah.

19:59.210 --> 20:01.040
They need to do better.

20:02.380 --> 20:04.120
Let's go.

20:04.120 --> 20:05.790
Okay, so now
y'all want to go?

20:05.790 --> 20:08.420
'Cause we could have done this
over the drive

20:08.420 --> 20:09.750
or during
a three-day weekend

20:09.750 --> 20:11.080
or during an episode
of "Shark Tank."

20:11.080 --> 20:12.420
We are not late.

20:12.420 --> 20:13.710
There was an assembly
this morning.

20:13.710 --> 20:16.000
What?
Yeah. Mason texted me.

20:16.000 --> 20:17.380
I didn't tell you
because I felt like

20:17.380 --> 20:18.710
you didn't have
my back today.

20:18.710 --> 20:21.000
So w-we still
can make it?
Yeah.

20:21.000 --> 20:22.210
You heard the boy.
The school is on CP time.

20:22.210 --> 20:23.580
Come on.
Let's make some moves.

20:23.580 --> 20:24.830
-Let's go.
-Okay, got --

20:24.830 --> 20:28.380
Colorism is our secret shame,

20:28.380 --> 20:30.830
and the pain it causes
keeps growing

20:30.830 --> 20:33.670
because we rarely
talk about it.

20:33.670 --> 20:36.580
But as I looked at my
multi-colored Black family,

20:36.580 --> 20:39.620
I realized that because
we talked about it,

20:39.620 --> 20:42.710
our wounds could finally
start to heal

20:42.710 --> 20:47.500
as we learned to love ourselves
out in the open.

20:47.500 --> 20:49.960
Because nothing gets better
in the shadows.

20:49.960 --> 20:52.080
♪ Ahh, ahh, ahh ♪

21:16.500 --> 21:17.670
Sorry, Jack.

21:17.670 --> 21:18.920
It's over.

21:18.920 --> 21:22.170
Nooooooooooo!
