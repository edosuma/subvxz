WEBVTT

02:14.534 --> 02:15.668
She is so good.

02:16.102 --> 02:17.103
She is awesome.

02:19.739 --> 02:21.474
This is insane.

02:22.041 --> 02:23.676
Why am I so nervous?

02:24.644 --> 02:25.645
Would you like to take this?

02:26.179 --> 02:27.247
I don't want any medication.

02:28.047 --> 02:29.349
Are you okay?

02:30.116 --> 02:31.184
Eyes closed.

02:31.951 --> 02:33.186
Inner peace...

02:34.120 --> 02:35.755
I'm not Hong-ju.

02:37.390 --> 02:38.658
Hong-ju is not me.

02:40.693 --> 02:41.728
What are you doing?

02:42.929 --> 02:44.030
I'm trying to calm myself down.

02:44.430 --> 02:45.465
Don't worry.

02:45.532 --> 02:46.966
There's no way you'll win this.

02:48.034 --> 02:49.702
Who knows?

02:49.769 --> 02:50.803
That's right.

02:50.970 --> 02:53.006
All of us have a shot at winning.

02:53.106 --> 02:55.108
Why do you always take his side, Na-na?

02:55.175 --> 02:56.009
It's Rian.

02:58.444 --> 02:59.946
How was it? Did I do well?

03:00.013 --> 03:02.048
You were amazing.

03:02.182 --> 03:03.816
You were better than me.

03:03.917 --> 03:05.652
So? Do you think I'll win?

03:06.119 --> 03:08.421
If I withdraw from this audition, maybe.

03:10.523 --> 03:11.891
By the way,

03:12.058 --> 03:13.693
is JB still not here?

03:13.960 --> 03:15.061
Oh, right.

03:15.261 --> 03:16.663
He's up next.

03:25.271 --> 03:27.207
You got me so worried.

03:28.241 --> 03:30.276
I thought you would be a no-show.

03:30.543 --> 03:31.377
How could I miss this?

03:31.811 --> 03:33.713
I would be doing you a favor
if I didn't show up.

03:33.780 --> 03:36.216
You owe me big time.

03:37.050 --> 03:39.519
I went through so much
to keep you from being disqualified.

03:39.686 --> 03:40.787
You didn't have to do that.

03:40.920 --> 03:43.723
You'll hate yourself for doing that
if I win this.

03:44.924 --> 03:46.893
Please win, okay? I beg you.

03:47.460 --> 03:49.329
You still haven't gotten down
on your knees before me.

03:50.096 --> 03:51.431
Today is the day.

03:51.998 --> 03:52.932
No.

03:53.533 --> 03:55.768
Today is the day
you're kneeling before me.

03:55.868 --> 03:57.837
No. Today's the day
you're kneeling before me.

03:59.472 --> 04:00.440
I'm taking the stage.

05:04.771 --> 05:05.772
What's he doing?

05:06.539 --> 05:07.573
Isn't he fully recovered?

06:03.429 --> 06:05.665
Why did he take the stage
in that condition?

06:05.732 --> 06:08.234
He should have just waited
until he's made a full recovery.

06:52.378 --> 06:54.313
Why did you hide it until now?

06:57.917 --> 06:59.152
You said you were okay.

07:02.722 --> 07:04.290
Would you have been able to
give it all up...

07:05.858 --> 07:07.260
if you were told you have no hope?

07:11.764 --> 07:13.733
I've danced my whole life.

07:17.770 --> 07:19.272
How could I just give it up?

07:25.311 --> 07:27.146
Whether I succeed or fail...

07:29.749 --> 07:30.917
I needed to try.

07:32.351 --> 07:33.286
This was how...

07:34.720 --> 07:36.022
I could figure out my next step.

07:38.424 --> 07:39.892
What happened to you...

07:41.461 --> 07:42.829
is all my fault.

07:43.396 --> 07:44.764
It's because I hated you.

07:48.668 --> 07:49.535
That's not true.

07:51.237 --> 07:52.805
I made it this far

07:53.039 --> 07:54.707
because of you.

07:55.508 --> 07:56.642
Thank you.

08:01.781 --> 08:02.915
Two years ago,

08:03.883 --> 08:05.618
you came to see
my debut performance, right?

08:11.557 --> 08:13.159
I'm glad you were able to...

08:15.862 --> 08:17.430
see my final performance too.

08:20.800 --> 08:23.469
I am glad to have you beside me

08:26.239 --> 08:29.809
from the start to the end.

08:43.923 --> 08:45.291
This is my tenth pair of shoes.

08:54.267 --> 08:55.101
It's a present.

09:01.641 --> 09:02.742
I have nine more pairs to go.

09:03.676 --> 09:07.013
I'll make my debut by the time
I wear out nine more pairs.

09:10.950 --> 09:12.652
This is the first pair.

09:13.819 --> 09:17.023
I'll also give you one of the second pair,
the third pair, and so on.

09:19.692 --> 09:20.860
Like couples have matching rings.

09:23.329 --> 09:26.799
You and I both worked hard for our dreams.

09:29.835 --> 09:31.137
You even worked harder than me.

09:34.507 --> 09:35.908
I know

09:37.376 --> 09:39.545
how much passion and effort
you've put into

09:39.946 --> 09:41.314
to realize your dream.

09:45.451 --> 09:46.919
I'll root for you now.

09:48.854 --> 09:50.089
Go out and sing for yourself.

10:19.819 --> 10:21.053
Before I sing,

10:22.588 --> 10:25.191
I would like to introduce myself to you.

10:32.164 --> 10:34.266
I know all too well

10:35.368 --> 10:36.535
what you say about me.

10:37.403 --> 10:39.038
"The pretty face of a girl group,

10:39.905 --> 10:40.906
a rude diva,

10:41.741 --> 10:42.742
and a bad actress."

10:45.144 --> 10:47.580
I had gotten so used to
what people say about me

10:49.915 --> 10:52.818
that I completely forgot
why I wanted to sing

10:54.120 --> 10:56.389
and perform on the stage

10:57.189 --> 10:59.358
in the first place.

11:00.793 --> 11:02.094
But then...

11:03.562 --> 11:05.531
I met an interesting friend.

11:07.633 --> 11:09.335
Despite her lack of talent,

11:09.468 --> 11:11.203
she wanted to become a singer.

11:13.673 --> 11:16.075
The truth is, I was jealous of her.

11:18.477 --> 11:20.846
At least she knew

11:21.914 --> 11:23.582
what her dream was.

11:26.552 --> 11:27.553
And...

11:29.388 --> 11:31.424
I met this other friend

11:32.191 --> 11:34.226
who threw himself in harm's way
to protect me.

11:34.493 --> 11:36.996
Word is going around
that you'll soon announce your retirement

11:37.063 --> 11:38.497
to take responsibility for what happened.

11:39.398 --> 11:40.599
Stop it.

11:41.033 --> 11:43.169
Please stop. This is a school.

11:47.273 --> 11:48.407
He taught me

11:49.041 --> 11:51.977
that I should cherish myself.

11:54.947 --> 11:56.082
Last but not least...

11:58.250 --> 12:00.086
I have a friend

12:00.720 --> 12:02.988
who has been with me
since we were trainees.

12:06.192 --> 12:07.126
He told me...

12:09.795 --> 12:11.597
I should sing for myself.

12:19.071 --> 12:20.339
This is my tenth pair of shoes.

12:23.042 --> 12:24.410
I'll root for you now.

12:26.412 --> 12:27.680
Go out and sing for yourself.

12:39.425 --> 12:41.260
He told me

12:42.094 --> 12:44.063
to sing for my dream.

12:49.201 --> 12:50.970
This is the first song I've ever written.

12:52.138 --> 12:54.006
Yu-jin wrote the lyrics.

12:56.308 --> 12:58.511
It's called "As the Days Pass By."

13:03.249 --> 13:05.217
That's my good girl.

13:08.854 --> 13:11.257
Even though we were
in the same girl group,

13:11.991 --> 13:13.759
I had no idea
she was struggling like that.

13:15.027 --> 13:17.363
She's not the type to share her problems.

13:32.778 --> 13:37.316
I had a long-held dream

13:38.684 --> 13:44.857
Will I be able to meet you someday?

13:46.125 --> 13:50.095
But I was always

13:51.397 --> 13:53.866
In the same place

13:53.933 --> 14:00.873
With tears of self-doubt wetting my cheeks

14:01.240 --> 14:04.777
As the days pass by

14:04.844 --> 14:08.180
I worry that my dream

14:08.547 --> 14:15.487
Will lose its way
In the wind and disappear

14:15.621 --> 14:19.225
Like I promised myself

14:20.159 --> 14:24.763
In my diary a long time ago

14:25.531 --> 14:32.004
I hope I don't grow weary
As the days pass by

14:34.440 --> 14:38.711
I did waver a lot

14:38.811 --> 14:42.815
I did cry

14:42.948 --> 14:47.119
A lot

14:47.853 --> 14:54.760
But as the days passed by
My dream carried on the wind

14:55.060 --> 15:01.867
Filled me and nourished me

15:02.167 --> 15:05.804
Like I promised myself

15:06.672 --> 15:11.243
In my diary a long time ago

15:12.044 --> 15:18.817
I hope I don't grow weary
As the days pass by

15:19.218 --> 15:23.989
I hope I don't grow weary

15:26.158 --> 15:28.093
As the days pass by

16:12.638 --> 16:15.541
She's so good.

16:16.608 --> 16:17.943
Should we sign up for Rian's fan club?

16:18.510 --> 16:19.378
Should we?

16:21.313 --> 16:24.049
This is the best I've seen of Rian.
How did she improve so much?

16:24.850 --> 16:26.819
Maybe it's thanks to her talented teacher.

16:28.087 --> 16:30.789
It's amazing how you can
praise yourself so easily.

16:31.757 --> 16:33.859
I wasn't talking about myself
but Sugar cube.

16:51.176 --> 16:52.878
I am not going to try to beat you anymore.

16:53.579 --> 16:54.413
Why not?

16:55.247 --> 16:56.815
Do you finally admit defeat?

16:58.217 --> 16:59.485
I realized that you and I

16:59.785 --> 17:01.420
have different backgrounds.

17:01.653 --> 17:02.988
Is this about that rock spirit again?

17:03.956 --> 17:05.090
Aren't you sick of it?

17:05.257 --> 17:06.325
No, it's not about that.

17:06.759 --> 17:08.460
I don't want to be an oaf like you.

17:09.495 --> 17:10.729
It's just not in me.

17:13.699 --> 17:15.134
You could have performed a ballad song.

17:16.235 --> 17:18.504
Why did you have to be an oaf
and take it head-on?

17:20.406 --> 17:23.709
Why did you have to fall down
and crack your knee open?

17:25.377 --> 17:26.645
Were you hoping for pity votes?

17:27.513 --> 17:29.014
Were you hoping for empathy
from the crowd?

17:31.050 --> 17:33.352
You mess people around
with your pity-me tactic

17:34.319 --> 17:35.954
just like Shin Hae-seong.

17:37.723 --> 17:39.058
I do, don't I?

17:39.825 --> 17:41.460
Take it seriously, will you?

17:42.861 --> 17:43.796
Knock them dead.

17:44.563 --> 17:45.464
For my sake.

17:45.631 --> 17:46.732
Stop it.

17:47.199 --> 17:49.068
I don't need your support
or encouragement.

17:49.535 --> 17:50.602
I'm awesome as it is.

17:51.670 --> 17:52.504
Wait and see.

18:12.624 --> 18:13.792
There he is.

18:14.493 --> 18:17.062
He's the one that looks
the most out of place here.

18:17.696 --> 18:21.467
Can a free-spirited rocker
fit into a teen idol audition?

18:22.401 --> 18:25.204
Look at me. I used to be a rocker,
but I'm running a talent agency.

18:27.106 --> 18:29.174
That's why people badmouth you.

18:31.143 --> 18:33.512
And you were a rocker,
but now you are a school counselor.

18:49.261 --> 18:51.497
When will you start running your own race?

18:54.333 --> 18:55.167
Come on.

18:55.567 --> 18:57.503
Are you going to be a pacemaker
all your life?

18:58.871 --> 19:00.839
If you stay where you are,

19:01.840 --> 19:04.510
you'll never be able to see what's beyond.

19:31.770 --> 19:34.840
EIGHT MONTHS LATER

19:37.609 --> 19:40.646
MY IDOL RIAN

19:40.846 --> 19:43.815
AILEE STOLE MY HEART

19:48.287 --> 19:49.388
RIAN

19:52.658 --> 19:53.492
Hi.

19:53.559 --> 19:54.560
MY LOVE RIAN

19:58.297 --> 20:00.699
MY LOVE UI-BONG

20:00.766 --> 20:03.235
MY PRECIOUS HONG-JU

20:03.702 --> 20:06.205
How does it feel to be back
after the EMG World Tour?

20:06.405 --> 20:09.107
We heard you'll be working
on the next album in the States.

20:09.474 --> 20:11.677
Rian, everyone's talking about you
and a Hollywood actor.

20:11.743 --> 20:13.145
Are you really dating him?

20:13.445 --> 20:15.714
Today is our graduation ceremony.

20:15.914 --> 20:18.784
We are running late,
so we'll do interviews after the ceremony.

20:19.685 --> 20:20.852
Just one question.

20:20.919 --> 20:23.855
Rian, you won the audition,

20:23.989 --> 20:26.558
but decided not to go solo. Why?

20:36.868 --> 20:37.803
Jin Yu-jin.

20:38.870 --> 20:40.038
Jin Yu-jin!

20:40.572 --> 20:41.873
Hey, Jin Yu-jin!

20:43.275 --> 20:45.510
Start singing. What's wrong with you?

20:54.853 --> 20:57.089
Does he have stage fright?
This so unlike him.

20:58.323 --> 20:59.291
You don't say.

21:22.047 --> 21:24.383
-What's he doing?
-What's going on?

21:28.220 --> 21:30.222
That's more like the Jin Yu-jin I know.

22:01.086 --> 22:02.020
That's it.

22:10.228 --> 22:11.797
What's with him?

22:24.443 --> 22:25.877
This is all I have for now.

22:27.746 --> 22:29.147
Why isn't anyone clapping?

22:37.122 --> 22:38.657
Do you want more?

22:39.524 --> 22:40.826
Should I play it one more time?

22:55.140 --> 22:56.908
This is all I can do right now.

22:58.710 --> 22:59.978
When I...

23:00.345 --> 23:02.381
manage to find the kind of music

23:02.981 --> 23:04.282
I want to do,

23:05.217 --> 23:06.718
I'll play it for you then.

23:07.352 --> 23:08.920
I'll play the kind of music

23:09.087 --> 23:10.489
that's uniquely mine.

23:28.306 --> 23:30.175
What's wrong with him?
He had a shot at winning.

23:30.475 --> 23:31.777
A dream doesn't have to be grand.

23:32.611 --> 23:34.846
Not everyone has to dream big.

23:36.281 --> 23:37.182
What?

23:37.449 --> 23:40.352
Having a blast and seizing every day.

23:40.419 --> 23:42.254
Isn't that good enough?

23:42.454 --> 23:44.122
Yes, it's good. It's a great dream.

23:52.664 --> 23:54.966
You sure know how to surprise people.

23:55.400 --> 23:57.669
That was very cool, Yu-jin.

23:57.736 --> 23:58.570
Didn't you know?

23:59.004 --> 24:02.007
I am the best at being cool
and second best at surprising people.

24:02.073 --> 24:03.008
Gosh.

24:04.075 --> 24:05.010
Jin Yu-jin.

24:08.313 --> 24:09.748
It must have slipped my mind for a while.

24:10.115 --> 24:12.317
Being groomed into a star

24:12.784 --> 24:14.486
is not my cup of tea.

24:14.853 --> 24:16.488
I'll just play the music I like

24:16.555 --> 24:18.023
and enjoy myself.

24:18.390 --> 24:20.125
You may never get a chance
like this again.

24:20.592 --> 24:21.760
For whom do you mean?

24:23.195 --> 24:24.529
For you?

24:24.629 --> 24:25.764
Or...

24:25.997 --> 24:27.833
for the super idols?

24:31.203 --> 24:33.305
I spent last ten years

24:34.005 --> 24:35.974
running away from the ill-fitting role
of New Clear Man.

24:38.443 --> 24:41.446
I can't waste any more time
being something

24:41.780 --> 24:43.081
I'm uncomfortable with.

24:46.051 --> 24:47.686
So, you'll give everything up?

24:49.421 --> 24:51.890
I'm not giving up. I'm making a choice.

24:59.498 --> 25:01.199
Wait up, Yu-jin!

25:15.013 --> 25:15.881
Where's my present?

25:17.983 --> 25:19.117
Don't be lame.

25:21.253 --> 25:22.754
No present?

25:23.421 --> 25:25.824
You've become coldhearted
after you became a world star.

25:27.459 --> 25:28.994
How's your mother?

25:29.995 --> 25:32.130
Sales have plummeted
since you left on your world tour.

25:33.265 --> 25:34.633
I'll stop by soon

25:34.799 --> 25:36.835
and order us a feast.

25:40.038 --> 25:41.439
I have a question.

25:42.440 --> 25:43.275
What is it?

25:43.475 --> 25:44.609
You won the audition.

25:46.044 --> 25:48.146
Why did you give up a solo career

25:49.047 --> 25:51.116
and insist on touring as a group

25:51.283 --> 25:52.884
with the other super idols?

25:55.153 --> 25:56.121
Because...

25:57.355 --> 25:58.523
they're my friends.

26:00.325 --> 26:02.494
I couldn't have won

26:02.894 --> 26:04.863
without my friends.

26:06.164 --> 26:07.832
It would have been hard
for me to do this alone.

26:09.034 --> 26:10.235
Is that why you gave it up?

26:11.536 --> 26:13.271
I didn't give anything up.
It was a choice.

26:13.838 --> 26:14.673
I made a choice.

26:17.208 --> 26:18.710
Are you impressed by me?

26:19.945 --> 26:21.112
This is all acting, isn't it?

26:22.948 --> 26:24.883
Why are you playing sweet?

26:25.350 --> 26:26.618
Stop it, okay?

26:27.385 --> 26:30.121
You see, I happen to have this thing
for sweet girls.

26:30.188 --> 26:31.923
Being sweet isn't your thing.

26:32.057 --> 26:32.958
No more, okay?

26:33.391 --> 26:34.225
Stop.

26:35.660 --> 26:36.928
Are you two finally a couple?

26:38.730 --> 26:40.065
Hey, JB.

26:40.131 --> 26:41.366
-Hello.
-Hey.

26:41.700 --> 26:43.268
Is Shin Hae-seong coming or not?

26:43.435 --> 26:44.803
Why do you care?

26:44.970 --> 26:47.472
Do you have exclusive rights to her?
Can't I even think about her?

26:48.206 --> 26:49.708
Chill out.

26:49.774 --> 26:51.209
You need a lesson.

26:51.676 --> 26:52.811
Let's duke it out.

26:52.877 --> 26:54.312
Fine. What's the game?

26:55.080 --> 26:57.415
It looks as though your knee's okay now,

26:57.816 --> 26:59.851
so if you lose to me today,

27:00.018 --> 27:01.786
you have to kneel for real.

27:01.853 --> 27:03.188
Of course.

27:05.256 --> 27:06.925
How about the loser takes
50 paces on his knees?

27:07.025 --> 27:09.361
That's nothing.
Let's go with a hundred paces.

27:09.427 --> 27:11.096
Fight.

27:13.031 --> 27:13.965
It hurts!

27:15.533 --> 27:16.935
Is Shin Hae-seong coming or not?

27:17.135 --> 27:19.170
Why are you asking JB about her?

27:19.671 --> 27:22.674
Because Hae-seong likes me.

27:24.309 --> 27:27.312
I'm the one Hae-seong likes.

27:28.313 --> 27:29.447
Ta-da.

27:30.949 --> 27:31.850
What's that?

27:32.751 --> 27:33.718
Wait a minute...

27:33.985 --> 27:36.121
Is it the lucky charm

27:36.187 --> 27:38.857
that makes you into a superstar?

27:39.324 --> 27:41.526
Song Sam-dong,
better known as K, gave it to me.

27:42.460 --> 27:43.595
What is this?

27:43.695 --> 27:45.263
Isn't it a superstition?

27:45.397 --> 27:46.865
It's not a superstition.

27:47.432 --> 27:49.000
You see, I won the Super Idol Audition.

27:50.335 --> 27:51.703
It's superstition.

27:52.971 --> 27:55.240
I'll acknowledge its power

27:55.640 --> 27:57.909
if you make it big in the States.

27:59.878 --> 28:01.112
Brace yourself.

28:02.047 --> 28:04.916
You'll see who comes out on top
between Hae-seong and me.

28:11.222 --> 28:13.024
-Ms. Ahn!
-Ms. Ahn!

28:13.224 --> 28:14.793
Thank you.

28:14.893 --> 28:17.896
Thanks, guys.

28:18.363 --> 28:20.565
-Thank you for everything.
-Thank you.

28:20.632 --> 28:22.801
You also did a great job.

28:28.239 --> 28:31.743
It feels strange that our kids
are graduating already.

28:32.143 --> 28:35.580
They could have been even better
if I had just a bit more time.

28:35.647 --> 28:39.117
You're so greedy. They already
improved so much thanks to you.

28:39.184 --> 28:40.385
Right?

28:41.986 --> 28:44.689
That's why
I wish I could have more time...

28:44.756 --> 28:47.125
They'll do fine on their own.

28:47.258 --> 28:48.526
You said

28:48.593 --> 28:51.129
students aren't like answers
but questions, right?

28:51.563 --> 28:54.365
Graduation's not the end,
but a new beginning.

28:56.101 --> 28:58.436
Ms. Hyeon,
you sound like a real teacher now.

28:59.237 --> 29:00.071
I do?

29:01.473 --> 29:04.275
Actually, maybe our kids
haven't even started anything yet.

29:09.214 --> 29:11.783
Was your tour schedule really grueling?

29:11.850 --> 29:15.053
Why are your cheeks
still so full and pudgy?

29:16.087 --> 29:17.589
HANDSOME PARK HONG-JU
HONG-JU ROCKS

29:34.572 --> 29:37.475
What is this? I can't get used to this.

29:40.545 --> 29:41.546
Get used to it.

29:42.213 --> 29:43.581
I'm a star.

29:48.319 --> 29:49.621
Give me a break.

29:50.522 --> 29:53.458
If you were a world star,
I would be the star of the universe.

29:54.959 --> 29:58.029
They say people should become
more modest the higher they rise,

29:58.396 --> 30:00.231
-right?
-It's good that Hong-ju's confident.

30:00.532 --> 30:01.366
Are you jealous?

30:04.836 --> 30:06.604
Why do you always take his side?

30:07.705 --> 30:08.973
What do you see in him?

30:12.510 --> 30:15.580
KIRIN ART SCHOOL GRADUATION CEREMONY

30:24.989 --> 30:30.094
You will now be stepping out
onto a much larger stage called life.

30:32.697 --> 30:34.666
What you do on that stage

30:35.133 --> 30:37.402
is entirely up to you.

30:46.744 --> 30:48.346
As a businessman,

30:50.048 --> 30:51.616
I can give you
one piece of valuable advice.

30:53.218 --> 30:54.752
Live debt-free.

30:56.054 --> 31:00.525
You're indebted to your friends
and teachers

31:01.626 --> 31:03.394
for all they've taught you.

31:04.963 --> 31:06.664
Pay off that debt by being good

31:08.199 --> 31:09.534
to everyone you meet in life.

31:21.779 --> 31:26.651
On behalf of our class, Shin Hae-seong
will now deliver the valedictory.

31:51.676 --> 31:53.845
While Hae-seong wanted
to be here in person,

31:54.479 --> 31:56.314
but her schedule wouldn't let her.

31:57.248 --> 31:59.584
So, she sent us a letter from the States.

32:00.985 --> 32:04.122
I will read the letter on her behalf.

32:07.458 --> 32:08.793
She never told me about this.

32:09.193 --> 32:10.161
See?

32:10.862 --> 32:12.096
I told you she dumped you.

32:25.310 --> 32:27.779
"My dear friends at Kirin,

32:29.280 --> 32:32.183
we are taught
from an early age to dream big."

32:33.518 --> 32:36.521
Adults around us say the bigger we dream,

32:36.587 --> 32:38.690
the more successful we'll become.

32:38.856 --> 32:40.391
DIPLOMA
NAME: SHIN HAE-SEONG

32:40.458 --> 32:42.260
They don't forget to give us the hope

32:42.927 --> 32:45.964
that hard work will bear fruit.

32:48.466 --> 32:51.602
But the road to achieving our dreams

32:51.669 --> 32:53.871
isn't always easy.

33:00.445 --> 33:01.813
You're making things hard for everyone.

33:02.914 --> 33:05.583
The audience shouldn't be able to tell
you are nervous.

33:06.384 --> 33:09.420
Shin Hae-seong is quite
the lost cause, isn't she?

33:10.788 --> 33:14.092
We often despair when we realize
we may not be good enough.

33:14.759 --> 33:15.693
Cut!

33:15.760 --> 33:17.195
Darn it. Retake!

33:18.196 --> 33:19.831
How many times do we have to do this?

33:19.931 --> 33:21.632
We need tears. Is that a tall order?

33:21.799 --> 33:24.335
Put your emotions into the scene.

33:24.836 --> 33:27.472
-I'm sorry.
-Darn it. It's freezing.

33:30.675 --> 33:33.945
We are dismayed at the size
of the hurdles in our path.

33:34.412 --> 33:35.713
What gives you the right to use me?

33:36.247 --> 33:37.415
A pacemaker?

33:38.716 --> 33:40.585
Why should I be your pacemaker?

33:46.758 --> 33:49.093
Some of us are even forced

33:49.560 --> 33:53.531
to give up our dreams
due to unexpected contingencies.

34:03.908 --> 34:07.345
While challenges and hardships

34:07.745 --> 34:09.881
wear us down,

34:10.748 --> 34:12.483
we did not give up on our dreams

34:13.184 --> 34:18.056
because we know we have friends
who support us and root for us.

34:42.880 --> 34:45.249
GALAXY

34:49.654 --> 34:52.390
While we will continue
to walk on this arduous path

34:52.623 --> 34:56.627
to our dreams even after we graduate,

34:57.528 --> 34:58.830
we will always stay friends

34:59.263 --> 35:04.469
and be there
to support and encourage one another.

35:05.136 --> 35:07.839
We're friends, right?

35:09.073 --> 35:10.341
You are my friend.

35:13.377 --> 35:15.813
Today is a day to celebrate.

35:16.647 --> 35:20.451
A star's brilliance
can only be recognized from afar.

35:21.085 --> 35:22.186
Likewise, we part ways today,

35:22.286 --> 35:26.724
so that we can all become shining stars.

35:29.794 --> 35:31.295
Congratulations, everyone.

35:31.629 --> 35:35.466
And I leave you
with what you most wanted to hear.

35:41.139 --> 35:42.807
The ceremony is over! Class dismissed.

36:17.708 --> 36:20.311
EIGHT YEARS LATER

36:26.717 --> 36:28.586
I dream

36:28.653 --> 36:29.987
One more time.

36:30.221 --> 36:31.088
Again?

36:31.756 --> 36:34.225
The show's in a few hours.

36:34.358 --> 36:36.227
We can't be stuck here recording forever.

36:37.295 --> 36:39.797
Then do it right,
so that I can give you the okay.

36:40.064 --> 36:41.499
Give me a break.

36:41.566 --> 36:42.433
No.

36:42.767 --> 36:44.769
I can't go easy on you today.

36:45.970 --> 36:48.105
You know how important this song is.

36:48.706 --> 36:49.874
I do.

36:49.974 --> 36:51.609
I know all too well.

36:53.311 --> 36:54.879
Then let's take it from the top.

36:58.816 --> 36:59.884
Eight years later,

37:00.318 --> 37:02.320
the teen idol
who said dancing was his life

37:02.587 --> 37:04.989
no longer dances.

37:14.932 --> 37:17.735
Our teacher used to be a super idol.

37:17.969 --> 37:19.270
I used to be a huge fan of his.

37:19.337 --> 37:21.305
He's still so cool.

37:25.076 --> 37:26.344
Back there.

37:28.579 --> 37:30.881
Will you keep yapping away?

37:32.850 --> 37:34.652
You don't dance with your mouth, do you?

37:34.785 --> 37:35.653
Watch it.

37:36.887 --> 37:38.022
Come up here.

37:40.291 --> 37:41.292
Hurry up!

37:44.662 --> 37:45.763
Honey!

37:50.501 --> 37:52.370
You yelled at the kids again, didn't you?

37:53.204 --> 37:55.273
We get calls from parents every day,

37:55.439 --> 37:57.908
complaining that we are stricter
than an entertainment agency.

37:58.276 --> 38:01.812
That's why our dance academy
is producing teen idols.

38:02.113 --> 38:02.947
Good grief.

38:04.081 --> 38:05.283
All right. Fine.

38:05.549 --> 38:07.718
I'll be nicer if you want me to be.

38:08.319 --> 38:09.887
Super Idol was disbanded,

38:09.954 --> 38:11.856
-Consider yourselves lucky.
-and the rebel couple found

38:11.922 --> 38:14.959
-You're excused.
-what they were best at.

38:21.565 --> 38:22.566
Please take a seat.

38:28.339 --> 38:29.507
How may I help you?

38:31.809 --> 38:32.977
I'm...

38:33.377 --> 38:38.115
tall, handsome,
and have a great personality.

38:38.316 --> 38:40.651
I'm perfect all around.

38:43.020 --> 38:44.588
But why is it

38:46.023 --> 38:49.493
that I always lose to a guy
who seems lacking on every front?

38:49.694 --> 38:52.930
Someone who seems
lacking on every front...

38:53.931 --> 38:55.299
like Park Hong-ju?

39:02.406 --> 39:05.109
Do you have psychic powers?

39:07.912 --> 39:09.680
What the... Why are you...

39:11.982 --> 39:15.486
You're still flirting
with every woman you see, aren't you?

39:16.554 --> 39:19.390
No. Never.

39:21.659 --> 39:23.794
This won't do.
I need to see what's going on in person.

39:24.328 --> 39:25.262
Lead the way.

39:37.708 --> 39:39.076
Why aren't you coming?

39:39.143 --> 39:40.378
Don't you trust me?

39:41.112 --> 39:43.013
I'm a relationship consultant

39:43.280 --> 39:45.449
with a perfect track record.

39:46.650 --> 39:48.486
-Let's go.
-The incompetent shaman

39:48.552 --> 39:50.221
-also found her calling.
-I'll help you.

39:51.389 --> 39:54.125
Ms. Ahn, are you sure about this?

39:55.159 --> 39:56.026
It's perfect.

39:56.093 --> 39:58.629
Mr. Yang, don't you trust
my fashion sense?

39:58.863 --> 40:01.565
You want to show them
all you've got, right?

40:01.632 --> 40:03.701
That passion
is what this outfit symbolizes.

40:05.503 --> 40:06.837
I think it's weird.

40:07.671 --> 40:08.973
-Mr. Yang.
-Yes?

40:09.039 --> 40:10.574
I came up with a choreography.

40:10.641 --> 40:11.642
So, I dance while I sing?

40:11.709 --> 40:12.710
Of course.

40:13.144 --> 40:14.178
Give it a try.

40:20.951 --> 40:22.286
Not bad, right?

40:22.386 --> 40:23.354
It's a bit strange.

40:23.421 --> 40:25.289
It's not strange. Just try it.

40:26.056 --> 40:27.091
Three, four.

40:27.191 --> 40:31.061
One, two, three, four.
Two, two, three, four.

40:32.296 --> 40:34.398
-It's great, Mr. Yang.
-Really?

40:34.532 --> 40:37.768
With that outfit and the choreography,
you're bound to be a huge hit.

40:39.236 --> 40:40.271
You rock!

40:40.337 --> 40:41.172
Go for it!

40:41.872 --> 40:43.274
-You mean it, right?
-Yes.

40:43.340 --> 40:44.308
You're sure, right?

40:44.842 --> 40:46.644
Now, good luck out there!

40:46.710 --> 40:47.878
You can do this!

40:52.917 --> 40:54.919
Jin-man, this is your last chance.

40:55.419 --> 40:56.253
All right!

40:56.587 --> 40:57.955
Next.

41:03.461 --> 41:04.728
Hello.

41:13.571 --> 41:14.805
YANG JIN-MAN

41:16.373 --> 41:18.108
You're a teacher at Kirin Art School?

41:18.476 --> 41:19.477
Yes.

41:19.877 --> 41:22.313
I wanted to give it one last try

41:22.546 --> 41:24.782
before my dream fades away.

41:26.784 --> 41:27.618
Well...

41:28.719 --> 41:30.387
tell me about your costume.

41:31.088 --> 41:33.991
It symbolizes my desire to show
my true and honest self.

41:36.760 --> 41:38.996
"Don't Leave Me?"
Did you write this yourself?

41:39.263 --> 41:40.264
Yes.

41:40.731 --> 41:42.600
Let's hear it then.

42:58.509 --> 43:00.578
Have you ever gotten
proper vocal training?

43:01.445 --> 43:02.446
No, I haven't.

43:02.846 --> 43:05.115
You need to work on the basics.

43:05.916 --> 43:07.651
You have to inhale

43:07.718 --> 43:10.287
and then exhale as you sing.

43:10.487 --> 43:14.558
You're scrunching up your face
because you can't sing properly.

43:18.896 --> 43:19.897
But...

43:21.899 --> 43:24.835
I applaud your courage.

43:25.269 --> 43:26.103
Also...

43:28.038 --> 43:29.406
your look is...

43:29.573 --> 43:32.509
one of a kind, at least in Korea.

43:37.982 --> 43:38.983
Mr. Yang.

43:39.216 --> 43:40.584
How did it go?

43:40.651 --> 43:42.119
-Did you fail again?
-Did you fail again?

43:42.186 --> 43:43.020
Well,

43:43.654 --> 43:45.289
I made it!

43:46.690 --> 43:49.159
Kirin Art School teachers are

43:49.493 --> 43:52.429
still working hard toward
their dreams of becoming singers.

44:02.473 --> 44:04.341
The diva who almost lost her voice

44:04.675 --> 44:06.477
overcame the crisis
through the power of love.

44:07.211 --> 44:09.313
She doesn't have the solo career
she dreamed of,

44:09.446 --> 44:12.082
but she has become a part
of this hugely successful duo.

44:19.990 --> 44:21.225
I didn't mess up, did I?

44:21.291 --> 44:23.327
Of course not.

44:24.428 --> 44:26.997
Why do they always sing duet songs?

44:27.197 --> 44:28.365
Won't they ever go solo?

44:28.499 --> 44:29.333
You don't say.

44:29.667 --> 44:31.902
Hong-ju really makes me mad.

44:38.008 --> 44:38.876
How were we?

44:38.942 --> 44:40.744
What do you think?
You were the worst ever.

44:44.515 --> 44:46.183
Thank goodness Na-na came to your rescue.

44:48.819 --> 44:50.587
Is your shoot over?

44:51.055 --> 44:53.057
Another soap opera, right?

44:54.425 --> 44:56.994
At this rate, you'll be typecast
as a cheater on every TV show.

44:57.394 --> 44:59.096
I'm in a TV drama series...

45:00.364 --> 45:02.332
and I play a romantic.

45:04.201 --> 45:06.570
Then, they must have picked
the wrong person for the role.

45:08.105 --> 45:09.073
Watch it.

45:09.573 --> 45:11.341
We should hurry. We're running late.

45:11.408 --> 45:13.410
We need to wrap everything up
before the show at 8:00 p.m.

45:13.877 --> 45:14.878
At 8:00 p.m.?

45:16.113 --> 45:17.114
What show?

45:17.648 --> 45:18.615
Our show.

45:22.553 --> 45:23.387
Let's go.

45:24.988 --> 45:27.591
Obviously, their love triangle

45:27.658 --> 45:29.727
hasn't been resolved.

45:29.993 --> 45:31.829
You're hopeless. Just give it up.

45:32.863 --> 45:34.364
Hey.

45:41.638 --> 45:44.074
The free-spirited rock star

45:44.274 --> 45:47.778
realized that it wasn't easy
spreading the rock music by himself,

45:48.011 --> 45:49.213
so he became a rock star by night

45:49.279 --> 45:52.716
and a teacher by day to nurture students.

45:53.684 --> 45:55.352
-He's just like Principal Ju,
-Louder!

45:55.419 --> 45:57.421
who's also a part-time rocker.

46:00.924 --> 46:03.293
About the joint musical

46:03.360 --> 46:05.295
by Kirin alumni and current students...

46:06.964 --> 46:10.367
It would be great
if you could all take part in it,

46:10.801 --> 46:13.637
but that's not feasible,

46:13.871 --> 46:16.073
so there will be an intensive audition.

46:16.440 --> 46:17.307
Therefore,

46:18.642 --> 46:22.412
you should all prepare thoroughly

46:22.880 --> 46:25.349
to land a part in the musical.

46:28.085 --> 46:29.052
No answer?

46:29.553 --> 46:31.655
-Yes, Mr. Jin.
-I can't hear you.

46:31.989 --> 46:33.490
Recite G minor, 100 times.

46:35.292 --> 46:36.293
Go.

46:38.395 --> 46:39.563
Well...

46:39.663 --> 46:42.065
Mr. Jin, may I have a word?

46:42.633 --> 46:43.967
I'm in the middle of class.

46:44.034 --> 46:45.269
May I ask what it's concerning?

46:45.936 --> 46:47.304
It won't take long.

46:47.504 --> 46:48.672
Hurry up.

46:49.940 --> 46:50.941
Recite G minor.

46:51.008 --> 46:54.745
-It won't take long, Mr. Jin.
-What is it now?

46:57.948 --> 46:59.917
Good grief. So, you did it again.

47:00.083 --> 47:01.485
What did I do this time?

47:02.219 --> 47:03.620
The director wants to see you. Let's go.

47:03.854 --> 47:04.888
Gosh.

47:08.959 --> 47:11.762
A joint musical
by alumni and current students?

47:13.397 --> 47:14.932
How can you issue a press release

47:15.065 --> 47:16.633
without letting me know?

47:16.700 --> 47:18.635
How will you handle this mess?

47:20.070 --> 47:22.873
I don't know, but there's no need to.

47:25.008 --> 47:26.844
It will be a great opportunity.

47:27.144 --> 47:31.181
The 17th anniversary of Kirin's founding
is coming up, right?

47:32.082 --> 47:36.720
I think the joint musical can become
a wonderful new tradition.

47:40.123 --> 47:43.227
Fine. Let's just assume
you had good intentions.

47:43.861 --> 47:44.728
What about the script?

47:45.262 --> 47:46.363
Who's the director?

47:47.130 --> 47:49.800
Who will do the alumni casting?

47:50.067 --> 47:51.335
Come on.

47:51.501 --> 47:54.238
Don't worry about it.
I have things under control.

47:54.304 --> 47:56.206
"Under control"? Give me a break.

47:57.541 --> 47:58.442
I mean,

47:58.909 --> 48:02.913
what is it that you plan to do?

48:03.580 --> 48:04.648
First, here...

48:07.551 --> 48:09.686
Take a look at the script.

48:10.020 --> 48:11.088
Here it is, the script.

48:16.660 --> 48:17.594
"Dream High?"

48:19.096 --> 48:22.399
So, that leaves

48:22.766 --> 48:25.903
Shin Hae-seong,
that tone-deaf ugly duckling,

48:26.136 --> 48:28.405
and Rian, that rude teen idol
also known as a bad actress.

48:33.443 --> 48:35.479
What? Who is she calling rude here?

48:36.980 --> 48:38.682
I'm not like that anymore.

48:41.084 --> 48:44.354
The script must be good.
It's moved you to tears.

48:47.457 --> 48:49.059
It's genuine and sincere.

48:55.332 --> 48:56.900
You're too kind.

48:57.234 --> 48:58.969
I'm the director who sent you that script.

49:02.072 --> 49:06.910
It is genuine and sincere, but not enough.

49:07.311 --> 49:10.113
There's still a lot of work to be done.

49:10.380 --> 49:11.415
A lot.

49:12.983 --> 49:13.817
Wait.

49:14.785 --> 49:15.953
Didn't you tear up earlier?

49:16.019 --> 49:18.322
What are you talking about?

49:19.456 --> 49:22.459
I was only straining
to make out the fine print.

49:22.926 --> 49:23.794
I didn't...

49:24.361 --> 49:26.096
You haven't changed, Rian.

49:28.498 --> 49:30.634
So, who managed to get

49:30.701 --> 49:33.003
a busy Broadway director to come to Seoul?

49:33.403 --> 49:34.771
Who do you think?

49:35.072 --> 49:37.474
Then, who got you to push back

49:37.641 --> 49:39.209
your busy concert schedule?

49:41.278 --> 49:42.212
Jin Yu-jin?

49:43.013 --> 49:43.847
You too?

49:44.247 --> 49:45.816
Yu-jin asked you to come?

49:47.951 --> 49:48.986
Might you be...

49:50.554 --> 49:51.788
in touch with JB?

50:03.333 --> 50:04.234
We're here.

50:30.093 --> 50:30.927
What do you want?

50:31.595 --> 50:34.031
You need to pay
if you've seen a performance,

50:34.197 --> 50:35.966
Ms. Kitty mask.

50:36.333 --> 50:37.367
Hae-pung.

51:04.294 --> 51:06.329
The musical we'll be doing

51:06.396 --> 51:08.565
is called "Dream High."

51:11.802 --> 51:13.703
You shouldn't make light of this

51:13.770 --> 51:15.839
because it's a school musical.

51:16.173 --> 51:17.574
A true pro does

51:17.641 --> 51:21.211
his or her best
no matter where they perform.

51:22.779 --> 51:24.815
That is why both alumni

51:24.981 --> 51:27.617
and current students will audition

51:27.918 --> 51:30.353
for leading and supporting roles.

51:30.420 --> 51:32.122
-Really?
-Is that true?

51:34.224 --> 51:35.725
No exceptions will be made,

51:35.792 --> 51:37.027
not even for Rian here.

51:44.201 --> 51:46.503
Shin Hae-seong, do you mean that?

51:46.736 --> 51:47.571
Yes.

51:47.737 --> 51:48.972
A rule is a rule.

51:50.841 --> 51:53.210
I pushed back my busy schedule for this,

51:54.111 --> 51:55.679
and I have to audition too?

51:55.979 --> 51:56.813
You do.

51:57.781 --> 52:00.517
I've never, ever made
an exception to that rule.

52:02.652 --> 52:06.089
I've even been to Cannes.

52:07.657 --> 52:10.894
Do you really think
this is worth my while?

52:11.628 --> 52:13.497
If you know you're good,

52:13.563 --> 52:14.865
what's the problem?

52:15.332 --> 52:17.400
Just take the stage
and prove it to the rest of us.

52:21.905 --> 52:23.306
Somebody stop her.

52:24.040 --> 52:26.042
No one can stop her now.

52:26.276 --> 52:28.912
Hae-seong's stubborn as a mule
when it comes to these things.

52:29.446 --> 52:32.682
Hey, doesn't Hae-seong
look like a real director?

52:34.818 --> 52:36.119
Even Al Pacino flies over

52:36.219 --> 52:39.656
in a chopper to audition
for a part he wants.

52:40.290 --> 52:41.691
You should know better than anyone.

52:42.425 --> 52:44.261
Am I right, world star?

52:52.736 --> 52:54.271
Fine, Shin Hae-seong.

52:55.739 --> 52:57.140
You're good enough to inspire me

52:57.207 --> 52:58.775
to be part of the musical.

53:05.081 --> 53:07.184
Ms. Pufferfish hasn't changed a bit.

53:12.789 --> 53:14.858
I'm taken aback by the TV news
every now and then.

53:15.392 --> 53:17.861
Who would have imagined
you would make it so big?

53:21.064 --> 53:22.699
How dare you call her a pufferfish?

53:28.605 --> 53:29.940
What took you so long?

53:30.807 --> 53:33.210
The star of any event
is always last to arrive.

53:34.444 --> 53:36.513
Everyone's a star here.

53:36.580 --> 53:38.114
HershE, I:dn, and Super Idol...

53:38.548 --> 53:41.017
We even have a Hollywood actress.

53:44.187 --> 53:45.155
Then I'll be...

53:45.555 --> 53:46.957
Shin Hae-seong's number one fan.

53:57.467 --> 54:00.103
KIRIN ART SCHOOL ORIGINAL MUSICAL

54:00.170 --> 54:01.471
Dad.

54:02.539 --> 54:04.441
-Hi.
-Hi, dad.

54:04.808 --> 54:05.675
Where's your sister?

54:05.742 --> 54:08.411
She's probably busy instructing
the actors in the dressing room.

54:08.511 --> 54:09.646
Wait until after the show.

54:09.713 --> 54:11.348
But it's been seven years.

54:11.781 --> 54:13.416
You missed her a lot, right?

54:13.683 --> 54:15.118
She hasn't changed a bit.

54:15.185 --> 54:16.353
-Really?
-Yes.

54:17.087 --> 54:17.954
My goodness.

54:19.356 --> 54:20.690
I'm sorry.

54:21.558 --> 54:22.392
Wait...

54:22.692 --> 54:24.494
Are you Rian's mother?

54:25.362 --> 54:26.296
Oh, my.

54:28.565 --> 54:29.466
Do you know me?

54:29.799 --> 54:32.168
I'm Shin Hae-seong's father.

54:33.003 --> 54:36.172
Oh, you mean Shin Hae-seong,
the famous Broadway director?

54:37.374 --> 54:40.377
-It's such a pleasure.
-Likewise.

54:40.510 --> 54:43.546
-Rian's doing great these days.
-It's all thanks to Hae-seong.

54:43.613 --> 54:45.348
Oh, don't mention it.

54:45.615 --> 54:47.083
Please put in a good word for Rian.

54:47.217 --> 54:48.952
There's no need.

55:08.938 --> 55:09.906
No.

55:10.473 --> 55:12.642
What are you doing?

55:13.810 --> 55:15.345
You're playing Hae-seong.

55:15.679 --> 55:17.747
You have to look as plain as possible.

55:17.947 --> 55:19.249
You need a plain face.

55:19.983 --> 55:22.352
Hae-seong is the epitome of plainness.

55:23.219 --> 55:24.120
Got it?

55:30.327 --> 55:32.462
I would like to have her wear this.

55:32.996 --> 55:35.398
Would that be okay, Director?

55:35.498 --> 55:36.766
Of course.

55:41.237 --> 55:43.773
Final prop check.

55:44.974 --> 55:46.676
This or this?

55:47.877 --> 55:48.978
We'll go with this,

55:49.579 --> 55:51.181
but we have to make it look more worn out.

55:51.514 --> 55:52.515
-All right.
-Okay.

55:54.317 --> 55:56.319
-These apples are no good.
-Why not?

55:56.553 --> 55:59.856
They need to be redder and shinier,

56:00.223 --> 56:02.792
so the audience can see them clearly
even from the back.

56:04.027 --> 56:05.028
Thanks.

56:06.463 --> 56:08.164
She's a real pain.

56:08.631 --> 56:10.166
I hate Broadway.

56:11.468 --> 56:12.335
Oh, right.

56:14.571 --> 56:15.772
I almost forgot.

56:16.773 --> 56:17.607
Spoon and chopsticks.

56:21.611 --> 56:23.213
We can use these chopsticks.

56:23.346 --> 56:25.115
You can borrow a spoon from the cafeteria.

56:25.949 --> 56:26.783
Okay.

56:26.850 --> 56:28.685
I know you're busy,

56:28.752 --> 56:31.020
but why are you
carrying chopsticks around?

56:34.290 --> 56:37.427
Is the CD with the theme song
still not ready yet?

56:54.844 --> 56:56.045
We are B,

56:57.013 --> 56:58.281
which cannot be A.

56:59.516 --> 57:02.051
We are B-grade, which cannot be A-grade.

57:03.319 --> 57:04.821
We are in the low-level class,

57:05.155 --> 57:08.892
branded B-grade here at Kirin.

57:12.495 --> 57:14.631
It's not just in our school
that students are differentiated.

57:15.098 --> 57:17.734
In any school,
there are good students and bad students,

57:17.801 --> 57:19.936
students on an academic track
and those on a vocational track.

57:20.136 --> 57:21.104
The names may be different,

57:21.171 --> 57:23.106
but we are always classified
into A-grade and B-grade.

57:26.743 --> 57:29.846
I had left this school
and only came back a few days ago.

57:30.980 --> 57:34.617
I ran away because I was ashamed
that I couldn't sing.

57:39.789 --> 57:41.758
This is what I would like to ask you.

57:42.692 --> 57:45.462
Should dreams be exclusively
for talented people?

57:46.162 --> 57:49.699
Should those less talented not even dream?

57:55.939 --> 57:58.575
You have to close your eyes
before you dream.

57:59.108 --> 58:00.143
And when you close your eyes,

58:00.210 --> 58:03.446
it no longer matters
how other people look at you.

58:04.214 --> 58:05.849
It is only when you close your eyes

58:05.982 --> 58:07.951
that you face the real you,

58:08.351 --> 58:10.520
not the person everyone says that you are.

58:10.920 --> 58:13.156
The real me I see when I close my eyes
says this to me.

58:13.656 --> 58:15.825
"Don't give up on your dream."

58:16.493 --> 58:19.762
That's because dreams are
not for the talented.

58:19.829 --> 58:21.331
It's for those who dare to dream.

58:21.831 --> 58:24.067
Like braving a storm

58:24.167 --> 58:26.669
with nothing but a small umbrella,

58:26.803 --> 58:29.572
we'll now dare to dream big

58:29.639 --> 58:31.875
with the little that we've got.

58:38.681 --> 58:43.052
This song is dedicated to all those
who agonize over their dreams

58:43.353 --> 58:45.455
and to those who are told
to give up on their dreams.

58:46.022 --> 58:48.491
This song is for all those
who are branded as B-grade.

59:15.051 --> 59:16.719
I dream

59:16.786 --> 59:20.356
When it gets tough, I close my eyes

59:20.423 --> 59:23.826
And I envision the moment

59:23.893 --> 59:27.864
When my dream comes true

59:28.464 --> 59:33.736
Today, like yesterday, I waver from fear

59:34.671 --> 59:36.306
That I might fall

59:36.573 --> 59:42.412
Like a baby bird that can't fly

59:43.079 --> 59:48.751
When I doubt myself and my dream

59:49.519 --> 59:54.023
When I'm consumed with fear

59:54.090 --> 59:56.960
With every step I take

59:59.429 --> 1:00:00.964
I dream

1:00:01.064 --> 1:00:04.601
When it gets tough, I close my eyes

1:00:04.667 --> 1:00:08.171
And I envision the moment

1:00:08.237 --> 1:00:12.008
When my dream comes true

1:00:14.077 --> 1:00:15.712
Yes, I believe

1:00:15.778 --> 1:00:22.785
One day I'll spread my wings
And soar up into the sky

1:00:22.919 --> 1:00:27.423
Freer and higher than anyone else

1:00:27.490 --> 1:00:33.029
I need the courage
To get back up when I fall

1:00:33.663 --> 1:00:38.334
To dust myself off

1:00:38.401 --> 1:00:42.171
To get up and run again

1:00:42.238 --> 1:00:47.543
To believe in myself again
To believe in my destiny

1:00:48.511 --> 1:00:53.082
I'll risk it all and jump over

1:00:53.149 --> 1:00:56.586
A wall that's taller than me

1:00:58.588 --> 1:01:00.023
I dream

1:01:00.089 --> 1:01:03.726
When it gets tough, I close my eyes

1:01:03.793 --> 1:01:07.196
And I envision the moment

1:01:07.263 --> 1:01:11.100
When my dream comes true

1:01:13.136 --> 1:01:14.804
Yes, I believe

1:01:14.871 --> 1:01:18.408
One day I'll spread my wings

1:01:18.474 --> 1:01:21.844
And soar up into the sky

1:01:21.911 --> 1:01:26.783
Freer and higher than anyone else

1:01:28.685 --> 1:01:30.253
To all the pain, I say bye

1:01:30.319 --> 1:01:33.690
Fly high like stars in the sky

1:01:33.756 --> 1:01:34.991
Make your dreams come true

1:01:35.825 --> 1:01:36.859
Now it's time to start

1:01:37.694 --> 1:01:39.696
Make it happen, don't fear the future

1:01:39.762 --> 1:01:41.297
Stride forward confidently

1:01:41.998 --> 1:01:42.865
It is my fate

1:01:42.932 --> 1:01:46.636
Our unstoppable destiny
Unfolds before our eyes

1:01:46.703 --> 1:01:48.404
This is for you, a whole new fantasy

1:01:48.471 --> 1:01:50.773
So take my hand now

1:01:50.840 --> 1:01:52.375
We only have one goal

1:01:52.442 --> 1:01:54.110
We won't give up our dream or future

1:01:54.177 --> 1:01:55.578
We devote our youth and passion

1:01:55.645 --> 1:01:56.713
Everyone, dream high

1:01:57.480 --> 1:01:59.248
I dream

1:01:59.315 --> 1:02:02.785
When it gets tough, I close my eyes

1:02:02.852 --> 1:02:07.490
And I envision the moment
When my dream comes true...

1:02:10.827 --> 1:02:14.731
None of us achieved our original dreams.

1:02:16.332 --> 1:02:17.400
But they say

1:02:17.567 --> 1:02:19.469
if you keep dreaming,

1:02:19.669 --> 1:02:21.938
you will eventually make it come true.

1:02:23.239 --> 1:02:24.707
Time has passed,

1:02:24.841 --> 1:02:26.876
and we've realized that we have become

1:02:27.677 --> 1:02:31.447
the stars of other people's dreams.

1:02:33.916 --> 1:02:36.385
While we're in different shapes
and colors,

1:02:36.953 --> 1:02:38.387
we're all shining stars.

1:02:39.856 --> 1:02:43.126
My friends were once stars

1:02:43.292 --> 1:02:46.028
who lit up my dark life.

1:02:47.363 --> 1:02:49.532
Likewise, I still dream

1:02:50.333 --> 1:02:52.034
of becoming an everlasting star

1:02:53.236 --> 1:02:57.607
that lights up other people's lives.
