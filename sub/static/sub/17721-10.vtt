WEBVTT

00:04.541 --> 00:06.458
Erica: Have you ever had
a feeling

00:06.458 --> 00:08.750
that's like an unwelcome guest?

00:08.750 --> 00:10.750
It invades your mind,

00:10.750 --> 00:13.083
and no matter how hard
you deny,

00:13.083 --> 00:16.708
misdirect, or avoid it,
you just can't make it go away?

00:17.083 --> 00:18.875
You tell yourself
you can control it,

00:18.875 --> 00:21.708
but the truth is,
it's never that easy.

00:22.333 --> 00:23.791
Deciding not to do something?
No problem.

00:25.416 --> 00:27.041
But deciding not to feel
something?

00:27.041 --> 00:29.708
A whole other ball game.

00:29.708 --> 00:31.916
- Erica, hey.
- Ethan, hey. Uh...

00:31.916 --> 00:33.375
I'm just running out,
I'm gonna be late.

00:33.375 --> 00:35.833
- I'll walk you down.

00:35.833 --> 00:37.750
Erica, you can't keep
avoiding me like this.

00:40.625 --> 00:42.541
- I've just, uh... you know,
I've been really...

00:42.541 --> 00:44.041
I've been really busy.

00:44.041 --> 00:45.875
- I texted you,
I banged on the wall,

00:45.875 --> 00:47.250
you're not getting rid of me
that easily.

00:47.250 --> 00:48.541
- You know what?
I'll call you tomorrow.

00:48.541 --> 00:49.666
Okay? I swear.

00:49.666 --> 00:51.416
I just, I don't want
to be late for the movie.

00:51.416 --> 00:52.708
- I'd love to go to a movie.

00:52.708 --> 00:54.041
(Door shuts)

01:00.708 --> 01:03.041
- So, Jude, she really wants
to see this sci-fi flick.

01:03.041 --> 01:05.791
It's something about aliens
bursting out of people.

01:05.791 --> 01:07.833
I mean, I guess it makes sense,
given that she's, you know...

01:07.833 --> 01:09.416
- Yeah, yeah, Erica--

01:09.416 --> 01:11.541
- The only sci-fi film that's
ever really done it for me

01:11.541 --> 01:13.125
is The Matrix, but, you know,

01:13.125 --> 01:14.500
it completely transcends
the genre of--

01:14.500 --> 01:17.000
- Erica, Erica,

01:17.000 --> 01:18.500
you haven't stopped talking
since we left the building.

01:18.500 --> 01:19.708
We're gonna be there
in a minute,

01:19.708 --> 01:21.333
We still haven't discussed
what happened.

01:21.333 --> 01:22.875
- Because I don't want
to discuss it.

01:22.875 --> 01:24.666
Don't you get that?

01:24.666 --> 01:27.166
I mean, Ethan,
it's embarrassing.

01:27.166 --> 01:29.708
I said... what I said,

01:29.708 --> 01:32.583
and you don't feel the same way
and that's fine, but I can't...

01:32.583 --> 01:34.666
I can't just move on and...

01:34.666 --> 01:36.625
stop feeling, you know,
what I feel.

01:38.166 --> 01:41.083
- Is our friendship over?

01:41.083 --> 01:43.833
- No. Of course not.

01:43.833 --> 01:46.208
- Then were gonna have to figure
out a way to get past this.

01:46.208 --> 01:48.791
Well, we are not figuring it
out now, 'cause there they are.

01:48.791 --> 01:50.625
- Is that Katie?

01:50.625 --> 01:52.041
- Yeah, she's in town
for a couple days,

01:52.041 --> 01:53.625
covering the Giller prize
or something.

01:53.625 --> 01:55.541
- Hey y'all! (laughs)

01:57.125 --> 02:00.625
Erica, you look amazing.
Have you lost weight?

02:00.625 --> 02:02.916
- Thanks. Uh, no.

02:02.916 --> 02:04.875
Um, yeah, you too.

02:04.875 --> 02:07.083
- And, Ethan, hi.
The last time I saw you,

02:07.083 --> 02:09.541
You were pretending
to be Erica's boyfriend.

02:09.541 --> 02:11.250
And I was pretending
to be a huge bitch.

02:11.250 --> 02:13.625
(laughs) Uh, how 'bout
you guys get popcorn?

02:13.625 --> 02:15.000
We can save seats.

02:15.000 --> 02:16.791
- Uh, o-okay.

02:16.791 --> 02:19.125
- So, you're a fourth grade
teacher.

02:19.125 --> 02:20.666
That is so awesome.

02:22.250 --> 02:23.666
- (Mouths "you okay?")
- Mm-hmm.

02:28.958 --> 02:30.916
- Why do they make the small
so big?

02:30.916 --> 02:33.291
My bladder's already getting
crushed under this baby.

02:33.291 --> 02:35.000
- (mimicking Katie)
"Have you lost weight?"

02:35.000 --> 02:36.750
I mean, what is that
supposed to mean?

02:36.750 --> 02:38.083
Maybe they'll let me get
a child size?

02:38.083 --> 02:39.583
Since I am with child.

02:39.583 --> 02:41.625
- And then the way that
she sucks up to Ethan?

02:41.625 --> 02:44.833
"Grade four? That is so
amazing!"

02:44.833 --> 02:47.166
I mean, she's in there
pumping him for information,

02:47.166 --> 02:50.250
"so, what idiotic thing
has Erica done lately?"

02:50.250 --> 02:51.291
- Erica... (sighs)

02:51.291 --> 02:53.000
You two have been fighting
this fight for years now.

02:53.000 --> 02:54.666
Why can't you just let it go?

02:54.666 --> 02:56.666
- Oh-whoa-whoa, me, let it go?

02:56.666 --> 02:58.708
She wrote in her column
that I peaked in high school.

02:58.708 --> 03:00.250
- She wrote about
a fictional woman.

03:00.250 --> 03:02.750
- Named "Merica Grange".

03:02.750 --> 03:04.916
A 32-year-old assistant
who... you know,

03:04.916 --> 03:06.875
brings a fake boyfriend
to her reunion.

03:06.875 --> 03:08.500
- Erica, she writes about
everybody in her column.

03:08.500 --> 03:10.125
That's kind of... her job.

03:10.125 --> 03:12.916
- Okay, and what part
of "Merica Grange" are you?

03:12.916 --> 03:14.500
- Oh, would you just
stop it already?!

03:16.625 --> 03:19.125
You know my back is killing me,

03:19.125 --> 03:21.416
and in three weeks I'm gonna
suffer through the worst pain
of my life

03:21.416 --> 03:24.583
just so I can push something
the size of a football
out of my vagina.

03:26.250 --> 03:28.750
Yeah, let me get a double combo
with double butter, please.

03:28.750 --> 03:30.583
- And a diet coke.
- Hm-hm.

03:30.583 --> 03:32.958
- You know, today I just wanna,

03:32.958 --> 03:34.916
I wanna to eat popcorn, and...

03:34.916 --> 03:37.208
and watch aliens
take over the planet,

03:37.208 --> 03:39.083
and just have fun with
my friends

03:39.083 --> 03:40.750
before my life changes forever.

03:42.250 --> 03:43.583
Okay?
- Mmm.

03:45.208 --> 03:48.750
- And in the column?
I was "Lisa Coles".

03:48.750 --> 03:51.166
The pregnant woman
that's terrified of kids.

03:56.791 --> 03:59.291
'Kay, I'm gonna go first.
- Thank you.

03:59.291 --> 04:01.416
- Just make sure you move when
I have to go to the bathroom.

04:01.416 --> 04:02.125
- Okay.

04:02.125 --> 04:03.833
- Well, I go to the Gillers,

04:03.833 --> 04:06.250
and then I usually take
some time off and go
to the Caribbean.

04:06.250 --> 04:08.833
Do some writing in a cabana.

04:08.833 --> 04:11.250
- Sounds amazing;
the life of a writer.

04:11.250 --> 04:14.000
Mind if I ask? Where do you
come up with all your material?

04:14.000 --> 04:15.916
- Oh, well,
that's the hard part.

04:15.916 --> 04:20.125
Sometimes I really search
until I hit on that right story

04:20.125 --> 04:22.166
you know, whatever I think
people are gonna connect with.

04:22.166 --> 04:24.750
I won't lie, it can be a slog
sometimes.

04:24.750 --> 04:26.500
- (Sarcastic tone)
Wow, that sounds really tough.

04:29.666 --> 04:33.000
- Well, enough about me,
how are you guys doing?

04:33.000 --> 04:37.333
Are you still just best friends
or friends with benefits?

04:37.333 --> 04:39.333
Ethan: So, the Gillers,
is that the tv prize or...?

04:39.333 --> 04:41.250
- Well, I know it's none
of my business, Erica,

04:41.250 --> 04:43.833
but I thought you should know
that that night at the reunion,

04:43.833 --> 04:45.916
I was actually really happy
for you.

04:45.916 --> 04:48.916
I thought, "finally, these two
are a couple."

04:48.916 --> 04:51.375
- Sorry, excuse me,
I need to get--

04:51.375 --> 04:53.791
- You guys just make the
absolutely cutest couple ever.

04:53.791 --> 04:54.583
(Laughs)

04:54.583 --> 04:56.250
- Why is everything in my life
a joke to you?

04:57.916 --> 04:59.375
- What are you talking about?

04:59.375 --> 05:01.791
- Guys, can we not do this now?
I mean really.

05:01.791 --> 05:04.000
I was just teasing.
God, you're so sensitive.

05:04.000 --> 05:05.416
- Ah, no, no-no-no,

05:05.416 --> 05:07.750
don't make it seem
like it is my problem.

05:07.750 --> 05:10.125
- Erica, can you just at least
move over so I can get up,
please?

05:10.125 --> 05:11.333
- You just can't leave me
alone, right?

05:11.333 --> 05:12.500
You can't stop rubbing it in.

05:12.500 --> 05:15.000
Maybe other people don't see
through you, but I do, Katie.

05:15.000 --> 05:18.291
- Oh, God, bathroom.
Bladder. Now!

05:18.291 --> 05:19.708
- Oh, I'm sorry.

05:19.708 --> 05:21.000
- (Horrified breath)

05:22.625 --> 05:24.208
(Screams of terror
from the movie)

05:25.875 --> 05:28.583
- Nice one. Let the pregnant
girl pee herself.

06:17.750 --> 06:19.458
- Ah, don't worry about it.

06:19.458 --> 06:22.625
Just tell me what's been
going on?

06:22.625 --> 06:25.083
- I don't know, it's like
every time I'm around Katie,

06:25.083 --> 06:26.708
I become this different person.

06:26.708 --> 06:28.541
Just seeing her, I...

06:28.541 --> 06:32.083
I get this tight feeling
in my chest and I'm so angry.

06:32.750 --> 06:35.166
What is wrong with me?
Why can't I decide just not to
care?

06:35.166 --> 06:35.750
- It's funny,

06:35.750 --> 06:38.500
watching you guys rip each
other apart like that.

06:38.500 --> 06:41.916
I was thinking about the day
that Katie introduced us.

06:41.916 --> 06:43.458
(Small laugh)

06:43.458 --> 06:46.083
You know, Katie's the reason
that we're friends.

06:46.083 --> 06:46.791
I know.

06:46.791 --> 06:50.041
Oh my God, Katie and I, we used
to spend every second together.

06:50.041 --> 06:52.166
She's the only friend I've had
since I was five years old.

06:52.166 --> 06:55.000
- See? There's history there.

06:55.000 --> 06:57.458
- And now look at us. I can't
even be in the same room with
her

06:57.458 --> 06:59.583
for less than a minute without
wanting to rip her head off.

06:59.583 --> 07:03.000
- So, what happened?
I mean, what's changed?

07:03.000 --> 07:05.041
I wish I knew.

07:08.166 --> 07:09.875
Can I borrow your phone?

07:09.875 --> 07:12.750
Why?

07:12.750 --> 07:14.250
(Inhales and exhales)

07:14.250 --> 07:15.666
(Cell phone rings)

07:18.500 --> 07:21.458
Katie: Hi.
Erica: Hi. Uh... Katie.

07:21.458 --> 07:24.250
- Can you believe what
a psycho Erica was?

07:24.250 --> 07:26.583
Thought she was gonna rip
my head off. Literally.

07:26.583 --> 07:29.208
- Actually, it's me, Katie,
it's Erica.

07:30.916 --> 07:32.500
- Oh.
- Look I didn't call to fight.

07:32.500 --> 07:35.125
I did- I did call to...

07:35.125 --> 07:38.000
Well, to talk about
what a psycho I was.

07:40.500 --> 07:42.291
- Look, I'm only in town
for a few days,

07:42.291 --> 07:44.625
So, really don't worry about it.

07:44.625 --> 07:47.958
- No, but I do worry because,
you know, that was...

07:47.958 --> 07:49.958
- Awful?
- Yeah. It was awful.

07:49.958 --> 07:51.583
And maybe that's all there
is to say about it,

07:51.583 --> 07:54.500
but don't you think that
we should get another try?

07:56.125 --> 07:58.083
I mean, we either try or we...

07:58.083 --> 08:00.250
really have to cut our losses
and...

08:00.250 --> 08:02.833
I don't think I'm ready
to do that.

08:09.166 --> 08:11.458
Katie?
- I'm still here.

08:11.458 --> 08:13.083
If you want, tomorrow,

08:13.083 --> 08:15.916
do you wanna go for lunch
and we can talk? My treat.

08:15.916 --> 08:18.458
I'm at, uh, River Rock,
It's on--

08:18.458 --> 08:19.958
- I know where you are.

08:22.125 --> 08:23.666
I'll see you at noon.

08:23.666 --> 08:25.916
- Okay, great.
I'll-I'll see you then.

08:31.250 --> 08:33.916
- It'll either work out,
or it won't.

08:33.916 --> 08:35.250
But you're giving it
another shot.

08:35.250 --> 08:37.000
- Mm-hmm.

08:40.458 --> 08:42.375
(Clock ticks)

08:46.583 --> 08:49.083
(Distant echo of phones ringing)

08:56.583 --> 08:58.541
Brent: Gun fight?
- Pardon?

08:58.541 --> 09:00.291
- Something going down
at high noon?

09:00.291 --> 09:02.000
- Oh, no, I'm just, uh,
just going for lunch.

09:02.000 --> 09:03.500
- Star spotting. Don't look now,

09:03.500 --> 09:04.875
but look who just walked in.

09:04.875 --> 09:07.708
- Oh! Hey! Katie!

09:07.708 --> 09:09.500
- You know Katie Atkins?
- Yeah. Katie.

09:11.916 --> 09:13.416
- Katie, this is Brent.
Brent, Katie.

09:13.416 --> 09:14.916
- Pleasure to meet you, Brent.

09:14.916 --> 09:16.458
- Pleasure is mine.

09:16.458 --> 09:18.125
- Oh my God, you have
to sign your column.

09:18.125 --> 09:19.500
You know, we should really go.

09:19.500 --> 09:21.208
Is that Katie Atkins?

09:21.208 --> 09:23.916
- Oh, Katie, this is, um...
this is my boss, Julianne.

09:23.916 --> 09:26.250
- I am a huge, huge fan.

09:26.250 --> 09:28.333
- Really? Oh, thank you.

09:28.333 --> 09:30.208
- You know, we should go,
I only have an hour.

09:30.208 --> 09:32.250
- Katie, I love your column.

09:32.250 --> 09:34.291
- Your writing style reminds me
of River Rock's bestseller...

09:37.666 --> 09:39.500
- Oh, Katie and I,
we talk all the time

09:39.500 --> 09:41.625
about "The secret of now".

09:41.625 --> 09:44.000
- It's a profound book.

09:44.000 --> 09:45.500
- I'm taking you to lunch.

09:45.500 --> 09:47.166
I wanna talk to your about
my latest brainwave,

09:47.166 --> 09:49.833
it's called "The none".
I think you're gonna love it.

09:49.833 --> 09:52.625
- Oh, I-I would love to,
but I already promised Erica

09:52.625 --> 09:55.166
I would go to lunch with her.

09:55.166 --> 09:57.375
- Oh, you can't re-schedge?

09:57.375 --> 10:00.416
- Erica is one of my oldest...
friends.

10:01.958 --> 10:03.375
And this is my last day in town,

10:03.375 --> 10:06.083
but it was great meeting you.

10:06.083 --> 10:08.166
Shall we?
- Mm-hmm.

10:09.625 --> 10:11.000
- Oh.

10:13.416 --> 10:15.125
- Thank you.

10:24.625 --> 10:27.500
- What was it,
our favorite drink?

10:27.500 --> 10:30.125
Vodka and orange juice?

10:30.125 --> 10:33.708
- Mm. I think it was vodka
and tang.

10:33.708 --> 10:35.583
(Laughs)
- Crazy.

10:35.583 --> 10:37.625
Crazy.

10:37.625 --> 10:40.333
(Uncomfortable exhales)

10:40.333 --> 10:42.166
- Do remember the dance?

10:42.166 --> 10:43.750
I could've died that night
if it wasn't for you.

10:43.750 --> 10:45.541
- Oh, God, that was such
a long time ago.

10:45.541 --> 10:47.875
- You had my back.
And I had yours, too.

10:49.500 --> 10:52.416
Kinda like with your boss
just now.

10:52.416 --> 10:54.750
Thank you for that.

10:54.750 --> 10:58.416
- Listen, Katie, uh,
about yesterday?

10:58.416 --> 11:01.541
You-you hit a nerve
and I just, I overreacted.

11:01.541 --> 11:03.000
- You think?

11:03.000 --> 11:05.083
- (Laughs) Anyway... I'm sorry.

11:07.583 --> 11:09.416
- Me too.

11:09.416 --> 11:11.000
(Relieved breaths)

11:11.000 --> 11:12.833
- So, why's Ethan a nerve?

11:12.833 --> 11:14.416
- Uh, well it's not so much
just Ethan.

11:14.416 --> 11:16.416
I think that it's...
my love life in general.

11:16.416 --> 11:17.250
- Hmm.
- Yeah.

11:17.250 --> 11:19.291
- Jenny mentioned something
about a big break-up.

11:19.291 --> 11:21.958
- With Ryan. Um, I ended it.

11:21.958 --> 11:24.208
- You did?

11:24.208 --> 11:26.416
What was wrong with him?
- Nothing.

11:26.416 --> 11:28.625
(stammers) It felt like there
was, um...

11:28.625 --> 11:30.291
there was something missing.

11:30.291 --> 11:33.416
- Uh-oh, holding out for
the perfect guy, it's risky.

11:33.416 --> 11:35.541
You could end up alone.

11:35.541 --> 11:37.666
My feeling is, everything's
a compromise.

11:37.666 --> 11:39.416
- You sound like Julianne.

11:39.416 --> 11:41.291
It's the premise of this book
that she's trying to do,

11:41.291 --> 11:43.541
"The none".

11:43.541 --> 11:46.666
The point is, is that
there really is no "The one".

11:46.666 --> 11:48.625
- Oh my God, I should totally
write it!

11:48.625 --> 11:51.416
- And you can pitch my life
story as "The hook".

11:51.416 --> 11:52.958
- (Laughs)

11:52.958 --> 11:55.208
No, but seriously?
It is kind of true.

11:55.208 --> 11:57.458
I mean, there is no "the one".

11:57.458 --> 12:00.541
No guy is perfect,
so, why be picky?

12:00.541 --> 12:03.291
Why not settle for what's
in front of you?

12:03.291 --> 12:06.500
Forget "Mr. Right",
give "Mr. Right here" a chance?

12:06.500 --> 12:08.875
- Nice one. Very witty.

12:08.875 --> 12:10.666
Maybe you should write
this book?

12:10.666 --> 12:12.833
Oh, thanks, but that's not
really my thing.

12:12.833 --> 12:15.208
I'm more of a fiction gal.
Mm-hmm.

12:15.208 --> 12:17.375
- Oh, that's cool.
To each their own, right?

12:18.916 --> 12:20.416
- Absolutely. (Glasses clink)

12:23.458 --> 12:25.916
Kate and Erica: (Laugh)

12:25.916 --> 12:29.375
- I'm glad we did this.
- Yeah, me too.

12:29.375 --> 12:31.708
- You know, this might be weird,

12:31.708 --> 12:34.541
but do you have dinner plans?
- Uh, no. Why?

12:34.541 --> 12:36.666
- Well, I thought, you know,
I have a late flight,

12:36.666 --> 12:38.625
so... if you wanted,
me, you and Judith could...

12:41.166 --> 12:42.625
- That's a great idea.
Let's, um...

12:42.625 --> 12:45.416
let's do it at my place
and we order in, get some wine.

12:45.416 --> 12:46.291
- Okay, yeah.

12:46.291 --> 12:49.166
- I just need a minute of your
time. 60 seconds, I promise.

12:49.166 --> 12:51.250
- Okay.

12:51.250 --> 12:53.833
- Erica, two lattes please.

12:53.833 --> 12:56.250
- Yeah, coming right up.

12:57.750 --> 12:59.750
- So, none of them is "The one"

12:59.750 --> 13:01.166
which means any one
could be the one.

13:02.750 --> 13:04.541
Katie Atkins writes "The none".

13:04.541 --> 13:07.791
My idea, her brand, bestseller.
What's the tagline?

13:07.791 --> 13:10.333
In a word? Forget "Mr. Right",

13:10.333 --> 13:13.083
give "Mr. Right here" a chance.

13:13.083 --> 13:14.500
I "heart" it.

13:14.500 --> 13:15.958
- Take a woman over 30.

13:15.958 --> 13:17.833
Series of failed relationships,

13:17.833 --> 13:20.583
ambitious, but still struggling
with her career.

13:20.583 --> 13:21.916
- The time's running out.
Tick tock.

13:21.916 --> 13:23.750
- She meets a perfect guy,

13:23.750 --> 13:26.500
but because she bought into some
Hollywood ideal of romance,

13:26.500 --> 13:28.750
she decides he's not
the perfect guy.

13:28.750 --> 13:30.458
Tragic.

13:30.458 --> 13:32.333
- We frame it as a
conversation:

13:32.333 --> 13:34.875
Two gal-pals having
a glass of wine at lunch.

13:34.875 --> 13:36.125
One's married, one's single.

13:38.916 --> 13:40.625
- I'm excited, Atkins.

13:42.458 --> 13:44.583
Thrill, thrill, thrill.
Let's swap cards.

13:44.583 --> 13:46.166
Both: Okay.

13:46.166 --> 13:47.916
- And, um, I'm gonna call
you tomorrow, latest.

13:47.916 --> 13:49.291
- Yes.
- Bye.

13:49.291 --> 13:50.750
Muah. Muah.

13:50.750 --> 13:53.291
- Ooh, exciting. (laughs)

13:53.291 --> 13:55.333
- Oh my God,
I think she liked my take.

13:55.333 --> 13:57.750
- Your take? Really?
- And sorry about the latte.

13:57.750 --> 13:59.541
That was kind of weird
for me too.

13:59.541 --> 14:01.708
Even though I know
it's your job.

14:03.333 --> 14:05.583
- Katie. Those were my words
you pitched.

14:05.583 --> 14:08.333
- I know. You have great
instincts.

14:08.333 --> 14:10.125
And your life story
makes a great hook.

14:10.125 --> 14:11.750
Thank you.

14:11.750 --> 14:13.500
I have always wanted
to write a book.

14:13.500 --> 14:15.416
- Yeah... I know the feeling.

14:15.416 --> 14:18.375
You're going to do your fiction
thing, right? One day!

14:18.375 --> 14:20.041
- One day! (forced laugh)

14:20.041 --> 14:21.958
- Okay, well, I'm gonna call
my agent.

14:21.958 --> 14:23.333
We're still on for dinner,
right?

14:23.333 --> 14:24.875
- You bet.

14:24.875 --> 14:27.250
- You're the best. Ciao!

14:28.750 --> 14:30.458
Hi, Lesley? It's Katie.

14:30.458 --> 14:32.250
I just had the most
incredible meeting.

14:35.333 --> 14:37.875
- Erica, my office.

14:37.875 --> 14:39.791
Pure genius, pitching Katie
"The none".

14:39.791 --> 14:41.791
Close the door.

14:41.791 --> 14:43.750
And I have a pretty
top notch idea myself.

14:45.958 --> 14:48.500
Junior editor. Who?

14:48.500 --> 14:50.750
- You.
- Me?

14:50.750 --> 14:52.708
- Yes, this is your chance,
Erica.

14:52.708 --> 14:54.458
You get to edit for credit.

14:54.458 --> 14:56.833
- Ah, I don't know what to say.

14:56.833 --> 14:59.083
- Oh, well, how about
"Thank you, Julianne"?

14:59.083 --> 15:01.625
Ooh, I have that,
that bestselling,

15:01.625 --> 15:04.750
prize winning, movie dealing
feeling.

15:04.750 --> 15:07.000
You don't have that feeling.

15:07.000 --> 15:08.458
- I don't know that Katie Atkins

15:08.458 --> 15:10.125
is the right person
for the book.

15:10.125 --> 15:12.291
I mean, trade "Mr. Right"
for "Mr. Right here"?

15:14.541 --> 15:16.916
That's... I fed her
that line during lunch.

15:16.916 --> 15:19.333
I mean, she's basically,
she's writing my story.

15:19.333 --> 15:21.500
It's the story of my life.

15:21.500 --> 15:24.000
- I think she's writing
a lot of people's life story.

15:24.000 --> 15:26.958
But she doesn't understand it
'cause she's never lived it.

15:26.958 --> 15:31.375
- (laughs) Well, then who
do you think should write it?

15:31.375 --> 15:33.291
Who? You?

15:33.291 --> 15:34.750
- That's... (sighs)

15:34.750 --> 15:36.458
- Ooh. (Clears throat)

15:38.000 --> 15:40.708
Hello, Brent? Yeah.

15:40.708 --> 15:42.916
Do you happen to have an extra
"reality check" laying around?

15:44.833 --> 15:46.875
Yeah.

15:46.875 --> 15:48.458
(Phone clatters onto cradle)

15:50.041 --> 15:51.666
Look, I know this must
be hard for you,

15:51.666 --> 15:53.958
staring down 40 the way you are.
- Excuse me?

15:53.958 --> 15:56.541
- And you finally want to make
something of your life,

15:56.541 --> 15:58.666
but you spent your 20's playing
while Katie worked her ass off.

16:00.208 --> 16:01.625
And there's a cost, Erica.

16:01.625 --> 16:03.416
And for those who work,

16:03.416 --> 16:06.791
And are-are focused
and talented, a reward.

16:08.458 --> 16:11.125
Junior editor, my final offer.

16:11.125 --> 16:14.833
- I will not edit a single word
that woman writes.

16:14.833 --> 16:16.250
- Wow.

16:18.125 --> 16:20.250
Is it me, or did you just
commit career suicide?

16:21.958 --> 16:24.125
Fine, if not junior editor,

16:24.125 --> 16:26.250
then, how about file fetcher?

16:26.250 --> 16:28.666
All our manuscripts from last
year, five minutes ago. Go.

16:31.875 --> 16:35.041
(on phone) Yes, hello. Hi, Les.

16:35.041 --> 16:37.958
I just met the most fabulous
client of yours.

16:37.958 --> 16:40.291
(with a laugh)
Oh, she did, did she?

16:43.541 --> 16:46.500
- Congratulations.
Junior editor, wow.

16:46.500 --> 16:48.166
- I hate her! Hate!

16:48.166 --> 16:50.333
I can't believe that
she is gonna write about me

16:50.333 --> 16:51.958
and get paid for it!

16:51.958 --> 16:54.541
- It was your idea.
- I was joking!

16:54.541 --> 16:56.500
"A man has two reasons
for doing anything:

16:56.500 --> 16:58.583
a good reason and the real
reason".

16:58.583 --> 17:00.625
J.P. Morgan.

17:00.625 --> 17:02.625
So what's really eating you,
my friend?

17:02.625 --> 17:05.125
- Katie. That self-involved,
overpaid,

17:05.125 --> 17:08.083
anecdote sucking vampire.
- (Whistles)

17:08.083 --> 17:10.250
- Okay, look, I know
that's not the answer
that you're looking for,

17:10.250 --> 17:11.708
but honestly, Dr. Tom,

17:11.708 --> 17:13.875
All I know is how I feel
when I'm around her.

17:13.875 --> 17:16.458
- Uh-huh, and how is that?

17:16.458 --> 17:18.416
- Defensive and...

17:19.875 --> 17:21.208
irrational.

17:22.708 --> 17:24.333
I feel worthless.

17:25.958 --> 17:30.250
- All right then, why don't you
tell me about this one.

17:30.250 --> 17:31.250
Casa Loma.

17:31.250 --> 17:33.833
- That's where Katie and I
worked in high school.

17:33.833 --> 17:34.750
- Giving tours?

17:34.750 --> 17:37.125
- Yeah. It's where I met Judith.

17:37.125 --> 17:40.750
Katie knew her from math class
and she got her a job and...

17:40.750 --> 17:44.541
Katie got fired.
And the regret was that...

17:44.541 --> 17:46.333
well, it wasn't entirely
her fault.

17:48.291 --> 17:52.000
My parents, they were going
outlet shopping in Buffalo,

17:52.000 --> 17:55.000
So, the idea was to have
a Halloween party at my place.

17:56.875 --> 17:59.791
But my parents, they found out
and canceled their plans.

17:59.791 --> 18:02.916
So the Halloween party,
it was a no-go,

18:02.916 --> 18:05.291
and I was really bummed out
until Katie had this
brainstorm.

18:06.916 --> 18:10.083
Have the party at Casa Loma.
After hours.

18:10.083 --> 18:13.416
Our boss, he was this really
weird older guy.

18:13.416 --> 18:15.500
What the hell was his name?

18:15.500 --> 18:18.000
I don't know, but anyways,
he loved me.

18:18.000 --> 18:19.916
He gave me the keys
to lock up after work

18:19.916 --> 18:21.833
And we used those to get in.

18:21.833 --> 18:24.041
(Music plays, muted chatter)

18:29.958 --> 18:32.250
It was a really great party
until,

18:32.250 --> 18:35.250
Katie, she took off with some
guy upstairs to hook up

18:35.250 --> 18:37.333
and the cops saw the lights on.

18:37.333 --> 18:39.416
(Muted wail of sirens,
hurried chatter of partygoers)

18:41.041 --> 18:44.416
The next day Katie
was fired on the spot.

18:44.958 --> 18:46.791
He blamed her for everything.

18:46.791 --> 18:50.333
And she didn't sell me out,
even though she could've.

18:50.333 --> 18:52.375
And I never stood up and took
my share of the blame,

18:52.375 --> 18:53.791
which I should have.

18:55.083 --> 18:57.041
And our friendship, it's just
never been the same since.

18:57.041 --> 18:58.875
And sometimes I wonder...

18:58.875 --> 19:01.333
if I would've opened my mouth
and defended Katie,

19:01.333 --> 19:02.958
maybe things would be
different today.

19:02.958 --> 19:04.416
I don't know. Who knows, right?

19:06.125 --> 19:08.041
But the truth is, is that
I had her back for years.

19:08.041 --> 19:10.291
You know, and I make one mistake

19:10.291 --> 19:14.166
and she spends the next
15 years getting back at me.

19:14.166 --> 19:18.041
I just, I don't understand
why she hates me so much?

19:18.041 --> 19:19.833
- (Taps pen) And what you would
do differently?

19:21.250 --> 19:23.000
- (Sighs)

19:23.000 --> 19:25.875
I guess, I wouldn't have
the party at Casa Loma.

19:25.875 --> 19:28.125
Then Katie never would've
got caught,

19:28.125 --> 19:29.833
never would've got fired,

19:29.833 --> 19:31.666
and... maybe things
would be different.

19:34.833 --> 19:36.708
(Case of beer shatters,
Erica gasps)

19:40.666 --> 19:43.666
(Nervous breath,
sheepish half laugh)

19:45.791 --> 19:47.458
Barbara: Sneaking a case of
beer? What were you thinking?

19:49.000 --> 19:50.500
- You know, I mean, I apologize.

19:50.500 --> 19:52.000
- Well, apologies just aren't
gonna cut it.

19:52.000 --> 19:53.708
If we can't trust you
to act mature

19:53.708 --> 19:57.083
when we leave you alone,
Erica...

19:57.083 --> 19:59.125
- Then we're gonna have to
cancel our trip to Buffalo.

19:59.125 --> 20:02.125
- No!
- Which means no Tommy Hilfiger
jeans for you.

20:02.125 --> 20:04.916
And no Coach outlet purse
for me.

20:04.916 --> 20:08.833
- And let me be clear:
there will be no party.

20:08.833 --> 20:11.833
- Great. Guess I'll just stay
home and hand out candy.

20:11.833 --> 20:13.708
My Halloween costume that
took, like, Katie and me

20:13.708 --> 20:15.333
weeks to pull together.

20:15.333 --> 20:17.875
- Decision made. You're
spending Halloween at home.

20:17.875 --> 20:20.000
I mean, can I-can I at least
invite some friends over?

20:20.000 --> 20:22.833
- Fine. But girlfriends only.

20:24.958 --> 20:27.666
- All right, I'm outta here.
Need a lift to work?

20:27.666 --> 20:30.083
- Yeah, that'd be great.

20:30.083 --> 20:32.250
Just let me get into my styling
Casa Loma uniform

20:32.250 --> 20:34.041
and I'll see you outside, okay?

20:34.041 --> 20:35.958
- Okay.
- Okay.

20:37.625 --> 20:38.958
Yeah.

20:41.833 --> 20:43.750
(Birds chirp)

20:52.125 --> 20:54.791
Katie: Erica. This is Judith.

20:54.791 --> 20:56.958
- Hey, it's nice to meet you.

20:56.958 --> 21:00.000
- You look kind of familiar.
Have we met each other?

21:00.000 --> 21:02.166
- Uh, I don't think so.

21:02.166 --> 21:04.125
- So it's my first day,
I'm... kinda nervous.

21:06.083 --> 21:08.291
- Couldn't take it at gap, huh?

21:08.291 --> 21:09.958
- How did you know
I worked at the Gap?

21:09.958 --> 21:12.041
- Uh, Katie...
Katie mentioned it, yeah.

21:12.041 --> 21:14.750
Bet you hated all those
early morning pep rallies.

21:14.750 --> 21:17.625
- Oh, hate isn't really
a strong enough word.

21:17.625 --> 21:19.500
- Judith's coming to the party.

21:19.500 --> 21:21.750
- Oh my God, actually,
the party's off.

21:21.750 --> 21:23.708
My parents, they totally
found out about it.

21:23.708 --> 21:26.250
- What? How?

21:26.250 --> 21:28.250
- Shift schedules, girls.

21:31.250 --> 21:33.250
(Paper crinkles)
- Thanks.

21:35.375 --> 21:36.916
- I was told that last week
you saw fit

21:36.916 --> 21:38.500
to take your lunch
at Sir Henry's table.

21:38.500 --> 21:40.291
It was too cold
to eat in the lounge.

21:40.291 --> 21:42.333
- Miss Atkins, working in this
building is a sacred trust.

21:42.333 --> 21:44.750
One that I am not convinced
you take seriously.

21:47.875 --> 21:49.458
On the agenda today,
a warm welcome

21:49.458 --> 21:51.458
to our newest foot soldier,
Miss Winter.

21:51.458 --> 21:53.791
Erica will show you around
our castle on the hill.

21:53.791 --> 21:55.375
- Oh, okay, great.

21:55.375 --> 21:57.166
Um, I thought that Katie
was going to be training me?

21:57.166 --> 21:59.875
- Yes, in light of miss Atkins'
recent lapses in judgment,

21:59.875 --> 22:02.416
she will spend the day
polishing knobs.

22:02.416 --> 22:04.291
Have no fear, Erica is far
and away our best guide.

22:05.875 --> 22:08.333
- Mmm.
- My lady.

22:10.041 --> 22:13.291
Um, I think I've mentioned that
I study the sport of jousting?

22:13.291 --> 22:14.791
- I vaguely remember that.

22:14.791 --> 22:16.333
- Yes, well, we have
a wee tourney tonight,

22:16.333 --> 22:17.958
and, uh... and I was wondering

22:17.958 --> 22:20.333
if you would be so kind
as to pledge me your colors?

22:20.333 --> 22:22.416
- My colors?

22:22.416 --> 22:25.250
- (Clears throat)

22:25.250 --> 22:26.833
- (Laughs) Um...

22:26.833 --> 22:28.916
- The tournament is
unfortunately in Hamilton,

22:28.916 --> 22:30.958
so I won't be able
to invite you...

22:30.958 --> 22:33.291
unless you're planning a trip
to Hamilton by any chance?

22:33.291 --> 22:34.958
Oh, sorry, it's, uh,
it's Halloween, so...

22:36.541 --> 22:38.041
I'm dressing up
as a sexy bunny rabbit.

22:40.916 --> 22:43.500
- (Clears throat)
It's-it's a pity.

22:43.500 --> 22:46.000
Um, could you do me the favor
then of locking up tonight?

22:46.000 --> 22:48.750
- Ah, I have to slip out early
to catch my chariot.

22:49.750 --> 22:52.333
- Ye olde Greyhound.

22:52.333 --> 22:54.333
- Um, you can count on me.

22:57.500 --> 22:59.916
- Good luck.
(Both laugh)

22:59.916 --> 23:01.916
- Katie, he totally heard you.
- And?

23:03.541 --> 23:06.083
- Oh, come on, you gotta admit,
the guy's a bit weird.

23:06.083 --> 23:07.333
- Oh, come on, he's sweet.

23:08.875 --> 23:10.541
Besides, he's just a kid.

23:10.541 --> 23:13.125
- What? He's like 25.
(Both laugh)

23:13.125 --> 23:15.083
- Oh, I mean, totally.

23:15.083 --> 23:17.625
Um, anyway, so,
welcome to Casa Loma.

23:17.625 --> 23:19.083
Why don't I, why don't I show
you around

23:19.083 --> 23:20.541
and Katie will see you at lunch.

23:20.541 --> 23:22.750
- Cool.
- Okay? Bye. Thanks.

23:22.750 --> 23:24.250
- Bye guys.

23:24.250 --> 23:26.166
- You're gonna love it upstairs.

23:28.458 --> 23:30.583
Okay, right this way folks.

23:30.583 --> 23:32.375
So, Sir Henry commissioned
the castle in, uh...

23:34.083 --> 23:36.458
I think it was 1915.

23:36.458 --> 23:38.166
Maybe it was... no it was
before the war, so...

23:38.166 --> 23:40.166
let's say 1912.

23:40.166 --> 23:42.291
- It says 1911 in the pamphlet.

23:42.291 --> 23:44.000
- Bingo, 1911.

23:44.000 --> 23:45.875
And I'm just testing out
our new trainee here,

23:45.875 --> 23:48.541
nice work, Judith.
So... um, oh!

23:48.541 --> 23:51.125
Check this out. (button buzzes)

23:51.125 --> 23:53.291
Ta-da, secret passageway.

23:53.291 --> 23:55.416
- Cool.
- Feel free to take pictures.

23:58.041 --> 24:01.375
- Hey, you guys.
I'm having a brainstorm.

24:01.375 --> 24:04.083
You have the keys?
We have the party here.

24:04.083 --> 24:05.958
- (Gasps) That would be so dope.

24:05.958 --> 24:08.416
- Ooh, no, not dope.

24:10.083 --> 24:11.833
Look, he gave me the keys
to lock up, you guys,

24:11.833 --> 24:13.291
not trash the place.

24:13.291 --> 24:14.833
- Oh, please, come on.

24:14.833 --> 24:16.583
We could tell everybody
they have to be really careful.

24:16.583 --> 24:18.125
And we already told
Zach's crew

24:18.125 --> 24:19.541
and he is really
excited about it.

24:19.541 --> 24:21.250
- Okay, well, Zach gets excited
if the wind blows.

24:21.250 --> 24:23.166
But... (sighs)

24:23.166 --> 24:25.583
You guys, I'm all about
the party

24:25.583 --> 24:27.916
until we get caught
and then Addison fires us.

24:27.916 --> 24:30.416
I mean, it's just,
it's too dangerous, so.

24:32.583 --> 24:34.583
I got an idea. Why don't,
why don't we go to my place

24:34.583 --> 24:36.416
and we can watch
really scary movies

24:36.416 --> 24:38.166
and we can hand out
candy to kids.

24:38.166 --> 24:40.500
- Oh, that's not really my
speed. You know, I'm not really-

24:40.500 --> 24:41.958
- Terrified of children, I know,

24:41.958 --> 24:44.125
but great way to get over it,
huh?

24:44.125 --> 24:46.458
Seriously, you guys,
it'll be fun.

24:48.791 --> 24:51.208
- Great. Fun.

24:55.250 --> 24:56.625
Jenny: (with English accent)
One cannot believe

24:56.625 --> 24:58.500
that thine younger sister
Samantha

24:58.500 --> 25:00.291
has cooler plans than we do.
Le lame.

25:01.750 --> 25:03.333
- Jenny...

25:03.333 --> 25:04.875
- Are we truly gonna spend
the whole night

25:04.875 --> 25:07.000
hanging with maman et papa?

25:07.000 --> 25:09.125
- Damn, I went back too far.

25:09.125 --> 25:11.166
Dad, don't keep rewinding it,
it's no longer scary.

25:11.166 --> 25:13.458
- I have a flask of vodka
within mine purse.

25:13.458 --> 25:15.083
- Girls, you're missing it.

25:15.083 --> 25:17.250
(Doorbell rings)

25:17.250 --> 25:19.041
- D-dad, okay, seriously.

25:19.041 --> 25:21.458
Don't-give me it. Give it.

25:21.458 --> 25:22.875
- Trick or treat.

25:22.875 --> 25:24.583
- You have got to be kidding me.

25:24.583 --> 25:27.166
Erica, I said girls only!

25:27.166 --> 25:29.500
- What is he doing here?
I thought that...

25:32.083 --> 25:34.541
- Hey, Zach.
- 'Sup?

25:34.541 --> 25:36.416
- Hey, Erica, wicked costume.
- Thanks.

25:38.041 --> 25:39.791
- We're just chilling,
watching some movies.

25:41.250 --> 25:42.833
You should stay.

25:42.833 --> 25:44.500
- Uh, well, uh... you guys know
River Phoenix died?

25:46.125 --> 25:48.125
- (Somber tone) Yeah.
- River who?

25:48.125 --> 25:50.375
- He's our generation's
James Dean.

25:50.375 --> 25:52.500
- Yeah. We're going to a
candlelight vigil at High Park,

25:52.500 --> 25:54.375
so, if you guys wanna come with?

25:54.375 --> 25:56.500
Pay your respects?
The miata's out front.

25:56.500 --> 25:58.791
- Oh, you know, we'd love to,
but we're on candy detail, so.

25:58.791 --> 26:00.416
- No problem-o.

26:00.416 --> 26:02.291
- Cool. Is that a cell phone?

26:02.291 --> 26:04.291
- Yeah, my dad got it for me.

26:04.291 --> 26:06.041
(Button beeps)

26:06.041 --> 26:08.250
So, let me give you my digits.

26:08.250 --> 26:11.083
- Hey.

26:11.083 --> 26:14.208
- Just give me a "what's up"
when you get off duty.

26:14.208 --> 26:16.375
(pop lips) Word.
- Word.

26:16.375 --> 26:18.041
- Uh... I should really
get going.

26:18.041 --> 26:19.500
I'll come with you.

26:19.500 --> 26:21.208
- No-no-no, You guys, you guys,

26:21.208 --> 26:23.750
My parents, they go to bed
really early. So, we can, uh...

26:23.750 --> 26:26.625
we can make popcorn and watch
"Interview with the vampire".

26:26.625 --> 26:28.333
- Uh, that's a book.

26:28.333 --> 26:29.833
Jenny: And that's my cue
to leave.

26:29.833 --> 26:32.583
I am so sorry, Erica,
but this is tres-pathetique.

26:32.583 --> 26:35.125
Plus, I loved River Phoenix.

26:35.125 --> 26:37.291
Shalom, cherie. Muah!

26:37.291 --> 26:38.916
Zach!

26:38.916 --> 26:40.416
- Mmm...

26:42.500 --> 26:44.708
- You know what?

26:44.708 --> 26:47.208
Why don't we break open
the ouija board?

26:47.208 --> 26:50.083
You and Katie loved playing
that when you were little.

26:50.083 --> 26:52.416
- Yeah, mom,
when they were seven.

26:54.666 --> 26:57.083
Erica, what are you
supposed to be?

26:57.083 --> 27:00.083
- Madonna? Like a virgin.

27:00.083 --> 27:01.541
- Not likely to remain a virgin

27:01.541 --> 27:02.958
if she goes out like that
tonight.

27:02.958 --> 27:04.583
- And I'm off to bed.

27:07.166 --> 27:10.166
- I don't think Erica has plans
of going anywhere tonight.

27:10.166 --> 27:13.416
- What? Not going out on
Halloween? That's crazy talk.

27:13.416 --> 27:15.000
- No, but I mean,
why would we go out

27:15.000 --> 27:16.500
when there's so many
fun things do here.

27:16.500 --> 27:19.083
We could play, like,
charades or risk.

27:19.083 --> 27:21.291
We could vogue.

27:21.291 --> 27:23.458
- Or we could party
at Casa Loma.

27:23.458 --> 27:25.666
Erica has the keys.

27:25.666 --> 27:27.791
- Sh-wing! Why didn't you
say so before?

27:27.791 --> 27:29.125
It's okay with us
if you wanna hang

27:29.125 --> 27:30.583
with your mom and dad, Erica.

27:30.583 --> 27:32.916
We understand.
- No judgment here.

27:34.625 --> 27:36.208
(Defeated exhale)

27:36.208 --> 27:37.916
- I'll drive.
- Shotgun.

27:37.916 --> 27:39.541
Okay, (stammers) wait.
aren't you guys forgetting,

27:39.541 --> 27:42.291
you know, one small thing,
hm? Hm?

27:42.291 --> 27:44.375
- Come on, Erica, it'll be fine.
Please?

27:46.583 --> 27:48.583
- You guys, this is not
gonna end well.

27:48.583 --> 27:50.958
- Come on, you're with
your big brother. Huh?

27:55.333 --> 27:57.500
- Fine.

27:57.500 --> 27:59.416
My keys, my rules.

28:01.125 --> 28:02.541
(Leo screams
and the girls shriek)

28:02.541 --> 28:05.375
Shhh, you guys!
You guys, seriously,

28:05.375 --> 28:07.375
If we're gonna do this
we need to be on guard, okay?

28:07.375 --> 28:09.625
Look, everybody stay away
from the windows

28:09.625 --> 28:11.375
and nobody goes outside
or upstairs and no candles.

28:12.916 --> 28:14.333
That means you, Katie.

28:14.333 --> 28:16.000
- Why are you singling me out?

28:16.000 --> 28:17.500
- I just am.

28:17.500 --> 28:19.541
- Let's get this party started.

28:19.541 --> 28:21.458
- Ugh...

28:21.458 --> 28:23.541
(Music plays, partygoers laugh
and chat)

28:27.208 --> 28:29.666
- I forgot how much
I love this song.

28:29.666 --> 28:31.625
- Me too, totally.

28:31.625 --> 28:33.541
- Cette soiree est wicked.

28:33.541 --> 28:35.291
- Hey, off with your head, Lady,

28:35.291 --> 28:37.291
for bailing on us tonight.

28:37.291 --> 28:39.500
- Hey, who's the best host
in the world?

28:39.500 --> 28:41.333
Erica strange.

28:41.333 --> 28:43.833
Uh, I was the one who suggested
Casa Loma.

28:43.833 --> 28:45.791
- Hi, little bunny.

28:45.791 --> 28:47.916
- Uh, Leo? Gross.

28:47.916 --> 28:51.083
- If loving my sisters
friends is wrong,

28:51.083 --> 28:52.458
I don't want to be right.

28:52.458 --> 28:54.333
(Girls giggle)

28:56.916 --> 28:59.208
- Oh, God, there's Zach.
You guys, let's go over here.

28:59.208 --> 29:00.750
- Erica! You have wanted Zach
forever.

29:00.750 --> 29:02.625
And this is your chance, so, va!

29:02.625 --> 29:04.208
Before someone else snatches
him up.

29:04.208 --> 29:06.791
- I'm just...I'm not in
the mood right now.

29:06.791 --> 29:08.833
Erica, Erica, listen.
If you don't dance with Zach,

29:08.833 --> 29:10.708
then he might find
someone else ce soir,

29:10.708 --> 29:13.000
and your chances with him
are (poof) fini.

29:13.000 --> 29:16.166
- I'll dance with him if you
want. As friends, of course.

29:16.166 --> 29:17.625
- No, no-no-no-no-no.

29:17.625 --> 29:19.375
I gotta think, you know,
long term.

29:19.375 --> 29:21.625
I mean... Jenny's right,
if I don't dance with him now,

29:21.625 --> 29:23.291
then I can screw up my future.

29:25.291 --> 29:28.791
Future chances with Zach.
- (Amorous murmurs)

29:28.791 --> 29:30.625
- Wouldn't want that.
(exited holler)

29:30.625 --> 29:32.583
- Woo!

29:32.583 --> 29:34.375
- Hey.
- Hey.

29:34.375 --> 29:36.208
Erica, awesome party.

29:36.208 --> 29:38.458
- Thanks.
- Hey, hey, hey, check it out.

29:38.458 --> 29:40.666
I brought my latest mixed tape.

29:40.666 --> 29:43.250
First song in there, dude.
Hit it.

29:43.250 --> 29:44.583
Wanna dance?
- Uh...

29:44.583 --> 29:46.250
(Hip-hop song plays)

29:46.250 --> 29:48.416
- Ohhh... (laughs) yeah.

29:48.416 --> 29:50.333
Woooo!

29:50.333 --> 29:52.125
(Partygoers squeal
and whoop excitedly)

29:53.625 --> 29:55.333
(Rap music plays)

29:55.333 --> 29:58.750
♪ ♪

30:10.458 --> 30:14.875
♪ ♪

30:23.208 --> 30:25.125
- Your tail's coming off.

30:27.583 --> 30:29.625
Great idea, coming here.

30:33.541 --> 30:35.416
Good work, Atkins.

30:41.583 --> 30:44.541
- Wow, looks like a bomb
went off in here.

30:44.541 --> 30:46.041
- Here. We gotta get
out of here soon.

30:46.041 --> 30:48.375
- Can't we just crash upstairs
in Lady Pellatt's room?

30:48.375 --> 30:51.375
- No. That would be a no.
For so many reasons.

30:51.375 --> 30:54.375
- Where's Katie?

30:54.375 --> 30:55.916
- Where is Katie?

30:55.916 --> 30:57.958
- Which one's Katie again?
- The rabbit.

30:57.958 --> 30:59.791
- (Chuckles) Oh, yeah.
Right, the stress bunny.

30:59.791 --> 31:02.666
- Oh crap, I know where she is.

31:04.500 --> 31:07.208
(Whispers) Katie.

31:07.208 --> 31:09.208
Katie.

31:09.208 --> 31:11.875
Oh God...

31:11.875 --> 31:13.791
(Heels clomp)

31:13.791 --> 31:15.250
Katie?

31:20.625 --> 31:22.125
Katie?

31:23.583 --> 31:24.916
Katie?

31:31.750 --> 31:33.500
(Passionate breathing)

31:35.583 --> 31:37.291
(Heavy exhale)

31:37.291 --> 31:38.791
Katie?

31:38.791 --> 31:40.208
Leo?!

31:44.916 --> 31:46.833
What the hell is going on?

31:46.833 --> 31:48.458
Katie: Erica?

31:50.000 --> 31:51.500
- Okay, so what? (Stammers)

31:51.500 --> 31:54.833
You couldn't get Zach,
so you go after my brother?

31:54.833 --> 31:57.708
What is wrong with you?!

31:57.708 --> 31:59.708
- Wait, that Zach guy,
she wanted him?

31:59.708 --> 32:01.541
- Look, for-forget about Zach.

32:01.541 --> 32:03.250
Leo, what-what are you thinking?

32:03.250 --> 32:04.916
I mean, Katie? Come on.

32:04.916 --> 32:06.541
- Why, because she's
your best friend?

32:06.541 --> 32:08.750
- No, because she's a nightmare.

32:08.750 --> 32:10.375
Well, that explains why
you've been inseparable

32:10.375 --> 32:11.875
since you were two.

32:11.875 --> 32:13.708
- Leo. She's-she's a taker,
okay?

32:13.708 --> 32:15.541
She's taker and a user.

32:15.541 --> 32:17.625
- 'Kay, what the hell
is your problem?

32:17.625 --> 32:19.791
She has been your sidekick
for a decade,

32:19.791 --> 32:21.500
Could at least give her
a break for once?

32:21.500 --> 32:23.708
- My sidekick?
- I mean, she's always
in your shadow.

32:23.708 --> 32:25.375
I mean, she practically
is your shadow.

32:25.375 --> 32:27.125
- Oh, she is not!

32:27.125 --> 32:28.833
- Okay, remember when you guys
were little?

32:28.833 --> 32:30.458
And you used to play
"make believe."

32:30.458 --> 32:34.500
You were "the princess"
and...what was she?

32:34.500 --> 32:36.041
- She liked being
"the lady in waiting".

32:36.041 --> 32:38.583
- Please.
- She did.

32:38.583 --> 32:40.375
- You've been bossing that girl
around since the second grade.

32:40.375 --> 32:41.958
You have more friends than her,

32:41.958 --> 32:45.083
you do better in school
and guys like you.

32:45.083 --> 32:47.333
No wonder she's so jealous
of you.

32:48.916 --> 32:50.625
- She's jealous of me?
- Duh.

33:06.125 --> 33:08.958
(with a German accent)
"Being entirely honest
with oneself

33:08.958 --> 33:10.958
is a worthwhile exercise."
Sigmund Freud.

33:14.583 --> 33:17.125
- Honestly, I am so lost.

33:17.125 --> 33:19.458
I have no idea what's
gonna happen tomorrow

33:19.458 --> 33:21.583
or what to do about Katie.

33:21.583 --> 33:24.416
I mean, Leo, he said that she's
jealous, but if that's true,

33:24.416 --> 33:27.000
Why didn't she say anything
before?

33:27.000 --> 33:29.583
- (Exhales) Jealousy.

33:29.583 --> 33:32.208
The great taboo emotion
of our time.

33:32.208 --> 33:35.166
See, Freud was all about
uncovering feelings
that people had,

33:35.166 --> 33:36.875
but that they couldn't
talk about.

33:36.875 --> 33:38.666
So, of course, in his day,
(German accent) it was sex.

33:40.291 --> 33:42.333
But these days, it's envy
that we've renounced.

33:44.541 --> 33:46.250
No one talks about it,

33:46.250 --> 33:50.833
and no one admits it,
even to themselves.

33:50.833 --> 33:53.875
- So what do I do? I mean,
how do you make somebody
not jealous?

33:53.875 --> 33:55.541
How do you even bring it up?

33:55.541 --> 33:56.833
- (German accent)
Hm, excellent question.

33:56.833 --> 33:58.416
How do you?

34:02.166 --> 34:04.583
- Sometimes you're incredibly
unhelpful.

34:04.583 --> 34:05.833
- (German accent)
Why, thank you.

34:15.875 --> 34:17.625
Erica: Hey.
Judith: Hey, you're late.

34:17.625 --> 34:19.208
There's a big group of Texans
waiting for their tour.

34:19.208 --> 34:20.875
- (Sighs) I had to take the bus.

34:20.875 --> 34:22.708
- Addison called a meeting
after work.

34:22.708 --> 34:24.833
- What? He can't possibly know.
We didn't leave a trace.

34:24.833 --> 34:26.208
- I don't know,
he's in a troubled mood.

34:26.208 --> 34:28.083
Something about being unhorsed.

34:28.083 --> 34:30.000
- Hey, Katie.

34:30.000 --> 34:32.125
- You have a tour to give and
I have chamber pots to polish.

34:32.125 --> 34:34.750
- Look, I totally crossed
the line last night.

34:34.750 --> 34:37.958
- The line? What line?
You just do whatever you want.

34:37.958 --> 34:39.625
- Leo, he's vulnerable.
And I...

34:39.625 --> 34:42.208
I know that you like Zach,
but he's not a catch. Trust me.

34:42.208 --> 34:45.208
I mean, I'm nothing to be
envied.

34:45.208 --> 34:46.791
- You think I went after Leo

34:46.791 --> 34:49.000
because I'm jealous
of you and Zach?

34:49.000 --> 34:51.083
- Actually, yes.

34:51.083 --> 34:53.041
- You are unbelievable.

34:53.041 --> 34:54.375
- Katie.

34:57.750 --> 34:59.666
Uh... morning.

35:06.791 --> 35:10.166
- I fear there was a breach of
the castle walls last evening.

35:10.166 --> 35:13.541
It was clear to me right away
who the culprit must be.

35:13.541 --> 35:15.125
What did you do, steal the keys
from Miss Strange,

35:15.125 --> 35:16.833
break in here for God knows
what perverted purpose?

35:16.833 --> 35:18.375
- I didn't steal anything.

35:18.375 --> 35:20.583
- You routinely flout the
responsibility and dignity

35:20.583 --> 35:22.166
that comes with a position
in the Casa Loma family.

35:22.166 --> 35:24.000
- It was-it was my fault.

35:24.000 --> 35:26.333
Um... (gulps)

35:26.333 --> 35:28.666
I used the keys so we could
have the Halloween party.

35:30.208 --> 35:33.375
I used your key. Fire me.

35:37.416 --> 35:40.833
- In the middle ages there was
a word for people like you.

35:40.833 --> 35:44.125
That word was "chivalrous".

35:44.125 --> 35:45.958
I don't know why you would lie
to conceal Miss Atkins' crimes.

35:45.958 --> 35:47.958
- No, but she didn't do
anything.

35:47.958 --> 35:50.666
- But perhaps your example will
be lesson to her in her future.

35:52.166 --> 35:54.291
Do you recognize this?

35:54.291 --> 35:56.791
From your costume, Katie?

35:56.791 --> 36:01.583
I have a tail, and you,
miss bunny, are fired.

36:11.041 --> 36:12.708
(Exhales heavily)

36:15.916 --> 36:18.708
- Katie. Katie, Katie, wait.
Wait, wait.

36:18.708 --> 36:21.208
- It's like when you're around,
people don't even see me.

36:21.208 --> 36:22.625
- No, that's, that's not true.
- Really?

36:24.208 --> 36:25.875
So, what just happened
back there with Addison?

36:25.875 --> 36:27.666
Or Judith?

36:27.666 --> 36:29.375
Who only wants to be
friends with you now.

36:29.375 --> 36:31.458
- Hey, listen, okay,
tell me, what can I do?

36:34.166 --> 36:36.416
- You could stop making me
feel worthless.

36:37.958 --> 36:39.708
Like, what you said about Leo?

36:39.708 --> 36:42.041
I wasn't with your brother
because of Zach,

36:42.041 --> 36:44.500
I was with him because he was
the only one at the party

36:44.500 --> 36:46.333
who could actually see me.

36:46.333 --> 36:50.750
But according to you,
I'm just a jealous slut, right?

36:50.750 --> 36:52.666
Whatever, I don't even care
any more.

36:54.500 --> 36:56.666
Katie.

36:56.666 --> 36:59.541
Whoa! Oh.

36:59.541 --> 37:01.541
(Papers flap)

37:03.833 --> 37:06.041
(Sighs)

37:08.375 --> 37:11.375
- Do you know how long it
took me to get credit on even
one book?

37:13.291 --> 37:14.083
- A really long time?

37:14.083 --> 37:15.708
- Do you know how many people
in this office

37:15.708 --> 37:17.791
would jump at the chance
to edit a memo

37:17.791 --> 37:19.541
Julianne is sending out?

37:21.041 --> 37:23.250
- Brent, what do I do?

37:23.250 --> 37:26.791
- For once... all right,
maybe twice in my life?

37:27.250 --> 37:28.916
I don't know.

37:38.958 --> 37:42.541
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

37:42.541 --> 37:46.208
Now you can go fetch me my
usual lunch, the sashimi 12.

37:46.208 --> 37:48.583
- Julianne, I um, I overreacted.
- Who, you?

37:50.250 --> 37:51.958
- It's just the thing is,
is that, Katie and I,

37:51.958 --> 37:54.000
I mean, we have history.

37:54.000 --> 37:56.750
And I know that she's felt like
she was always in my shadow,

37:56.750 --> 37:59.833
so now she does things
to get back at me

37:59.833 --> 38:01.916
and I just, I always take
the bait,

38:01.916 --> 38:04.541
but I'm not gonna
do that anymore.

38:06.041 --> 38:08.750
- She's in your shadow?

38:08.750 --> 38:12.125
Okay. (clears throat)
- What?

38:12.125 --> 38:14.541
- Okay, okay, I'm just gonna
save you a lot of therapy

38:16.041 --> 38:17.541
and "break it down".

38:17.541 --> 38:19.000
You're an assistant,
she's a star columnist.

38:21.041 --> 38:22.500
You're single, she's married.

38:24.041 --> 38:25.666
You're jealous...

38:25.666 --> 38:29.125
and guess what? She's not.

38:29.125 --> 38:33.250
If you want me to even
let you press spell-check
on "The none"?

38:33.250 --> 38:36.375
You will get over your issues
with Katie. Pronto.

38:36.375 --> 38:39.333
Oh, and you will get me a green
tea ice cream for dessert.

38:39.333 --> 38:40.916
(Computer keys clack)

38:52.375 --> 38:54.000
- Chinese. Thai.

38:56.041 --> 38:58.291
Malaysian, but...

39:00.125 --> 39:02.000
Whoa, easy there.

39:02.000 --> 39:03.791
(Knocking on door)

39:03.791 --> 39:06.166
Uh, it's open. Come on in.

39:07.791 --> 39:09.250
- Hey, girls.

39:09.250 --> 39:10.625
Judith: Hey.
Erica: Hi.

39:13.208 --> 39:14.750
Katie: What's going on?

39:14.750 --> 39:17.833
- Nothing. I-I don't think.

39:17.833 --> 39:20.125
- Uh, you know what, Judith?
Could you just leave us alone
for a second?

39:20.125 --> 39:21.208
I just wanted to talk to Katie.

39:21.208 --> 39:23.458
- What, you want me to just
stand out in the hall?

39:23.458 --> 39:26.833
- Well, not really, but...
Judith: Good.

39:26.833 --> 39:29.000
'Cause this pregnant girl
needs to sit.

39:31.416 --> 39:34.000
- (Half laughs)

39:34.000 --> 39:35.750
Katie, um...

39:37.208 --> 39:39.000
Whew.

39:39.000 --> 39:41.541
Katie: Okay, you're making me
nervous. Did I do something?

39:41.541 --> 39:44.083
- No, no, not at all.
This is, um...

39:44.083 --> 39:46.041
this is about the book.

39:46.041 --> 39:49.125
This is about our friendship,
this is about...

39:49.125 --> 39:52.125
um... the fact that
for the past couple years,

39:52.125 --> 39:54.041
I have been eaten alive
by jealousy.

39:56.458 --> 39:58.791
- Uh, you know, I am gonna go
stand in the hall.

39:58.791 --> 40:00.208
- You know what, Judith, stay.

40:00.208 --> 40:01.625
I think that you should
hear this.

40:01.625 --> 40:03.375
I have been insanely jealous.

40:03.375 --> 40:06.000
And I see now, just how stupid
that is

40:06.000 --> 40:09.291
because I actually...
I don't want your life at all.

40:09.291 --> 40:11.208
- So, you agreed
to have dinner with me,

40:11.208 --> 40:13.500
so you could tell me how much
you didn't want my life?

40:13.500 --> 40:15.916
- No, no, no-no-no, Katie,
that's not what I mean.

40:15.916 --> 40:17.958
It's just, I don't,
I don't wanna do this anymore.

40:17.958 --> 40:22.000
I wanna, I wanna be honest
with you and it's...

40:22.000 --> 40:24.416
it's really hard to tell
someone that you're jealous
of them

40:24.416 --> 40:25.833
because it's not that
I'm angry with you

40:25.833 --> 40:27.916
or that I'm...or that I'm hurt.

40:27.916 --> 40:29.375
Judith: Guys.
Erica: Judith, please.

40:29.375 --> 40:31.000
- It's just something that
you don't usually admit.

40:33.208 --> 40:35.458
- Even to yourself.
Judith: Guys.

40:35.458 --> 40:37.458
Erica: Judith.
- No, I-I feel really weird.

40:37.458 --> 40:39.125
Ah.

40:39.125 --> 40:40.875
(Water splatters)

40:40.875 --> 40:42.791
- Oh my God!

40:45.083 --> 40:46.708
- That ain't pee.

40:48.375 --> 40:50.791
Erica: Just remember that
breathing thing, Judith.

40:50.791 --> 40:52.333
Anthony: Inhale twice,
exhale once.
- Yeah. (Breathing)

40:52.333 --> 40:53.333
(Mimicking Judith's breaths)

40:53.333 --> 40:54.291
- Okay, look, Anthony, whoa.

40:54.291 --> 40:55.666
I got this for you,
for the hospital. Okay?

40:55.666 --> 40:57.208
- Thank you, thank you so much.
- Got it?

40:57.208 --> 40:58.875
- Thank you guys so much
for taking care of her.

40:58.875 --> 41:00.500
- Anthony! Come on!
- Okay, I'm coming. I'm coming.

41:00.500 --> 41:02.125
We're okay. We're okay.

41:02.125 --> 41:03.625
Erica: Jude, I'll call you!

41:03.625 --> 41:06.250
Judith: Okay, just stop
talking, start driving.

41:06.250 --> 41:07.750
(Tires squeal)
Katie: Whoa, easy. Whew.

41:09.375 --> 41:11.250
Anthony's barely
holding it together.

41:11.250 --> 41:13.541
- Well, no one's perfect.

41:13.541 --> 41:15.083
- Anthony's pretty close.

41:15.083 --> 41:17.291
- See, you're wrong about
"Mr. Right here".

41:17.291 --> 41:19.375
Judith didn't settle.

41:19.375 --> 41:21.000
You didn't settle with Brian.

41:21.000 --> 41:22.875
I mean, you guys have
always been madly in love.

41:22.875 --> 41:24.625
- True.

41:24.625 --> 41:27.166
And that helped us get through
all the bumpy bits at first.

41:27.166 --> 41:29.250
Then we had to work really hard
at our marriage.

41:29.250 --> 41:31.458
And then?

41:31.458 --> 41:33.458
- And then we fell even more
in love.

41:36.166 --> 41:38.458
- "The none" should be about
how none of us are perfect.

41:38.458 --> 41:41.291
Single or married, how we all
have to work at it.

41:41.291 --> 41:44.333
And you should be
the one to write it.

41:44.333 --> 41:46.250
- Truth?

41:49.375 --> 41:51.458
I don't know if I can write
a whole book. I'm scared.

41:53.166 --> 41:55.500
I'm not a very good writer.

41:55.500 --> 41:57.666
I have a fantastic editor
at The Globe,

41:57.666 --> 41:59.500
she's like you. You would love
her. She's a fiction nut.

42:00.958 --> 42:02.750
- (Laughs)

42:02.750 --> 42:05.375
Honestly, your column is the
first thing that I look for

42:05.375 --> 42:07.041
in the weekend paper.

42:07.041 --> 42:10.541
And not just to see
if I'm in it.

42:10.541 --> 42:13.125
- For real?
- Mm-hmm.

42:14.000 --> 42:16.000
And Julianne, she offered me
junior editor on your book.

42:16.000 --> 42:17.833
So, don't be scared, okay?

42:17.833 --> 42:19.791
I got your back.

42:21.750 --> 42:24.416
- Woo! Okay. I'm gonna see you
soon, right?

42:24.416 --> 42:26.875
- Totally.
- Okay.

42:26.875 --> 42:28.500
- Okay.
- Thank you.

42:30.041 --> 42:32.000
- Bye!

42:40.250 --> 42:42.375
Erica: Feelings...

42:42.375 --> 42:45.250
so often we fool ourselves into
thinking we can control them,

42:45.250 --> 42:47.416
until one day we're ambushed;

42:47.416 --> 42:49.458
caught off guard by rage
or jealousy or... love.

42:51.250 --> 42:53.291
And we're forced
to face the truth.

42:53.291 --> 42:56.083
- Hey.

42:56.083 --> 42:58.250
Wanna watch a movie?
- No.

43:01.416 --> 43:03.166
- Jesus, Erica.

43:06.416 --> 43:08.375
I feel like I'm losing you.

43:08.375 --> 43:10.458
- Well, you're not.

43:10.458 --> 43:13.000
I mean, our friendship it's,
it's still there.

43:13.000 --> 43:14.791
It's somewhere.

43:14.791 --> 43:16.500
And I know that I'll find
my way back to it,

43:16.500 --> 43:18.416
but I need some time.

43:20.625 --> 43:23.041
- What can I do?
- Nothing.

43:23.041 --> 43:26.666
You just have to wait...
for me to be ready.

43:26.666 --> 43:28.500
- And what if you're
never ready?

43:31.041 --> 43:33.416
Erica: The truth is this...

43:33.416 --> 43:37.166
you can't control how you feel,
only what you do about it.
