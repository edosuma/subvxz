00:00.200 --> 00:02.326
Previously on House of lies...

00:02.327 --> 00:04.067
I'm out,
I will start my own shop.

00:04.067 --> 00:06.370
You want to fuck my shit up?
I will fuck

00:06.371 --> 00:08.238
yours up, too.

00:08.239 --> 00:09.673
I was thinking that
it was time for you

00:09.674 --> 00:11.041
to run your own pod.

00:11.042 --> 00:12.976
- I thought you were coming with me.
- I am.

00:12.977 --> 00:14.733
- I can't do it. I'm calling Marty.
- No!

00:14.734 --> 00:15.838
You're gonna go in there,

00:15.839 --> 00:17.105
and you're gonna
do this yourself.

00:17.106 --> 00:18.545
<i>Clyde:
Because of my connections,</i>

00:18.546 --> 00:19.617
I'm gonna bring so much

00:19.618 --> 00:21.088
after work casheesh
to this company.

00:21.089 --> 00:23.727
I'm just saying that the Carlson
deal is not even closed yet.

00:23.728 --> 00:25.529
<i>Nate: Is something going on
with you and Marty?</i>

00:25.530 --> 00:26.330
<i>Jeannie:
No.</i>

00:26.331 --> 00:27.365
Are you breaking up with me?

00:27.366 --> 00:28.166
I don't think you should.

00:28.167 --> 00:28.936
I'm sorry.

00:28.937 --> 00:30.771
You fucked me over, okay?

00:30.772 --> 00:31.772
You played me.

00:31.773 --> 00:33.308
Let's go to Vegas.

00:33.309 --> 00:35.246
<i>Copy of the deal is sitting
on my desk.</i>

00:35.247 --> 00:36.584
<i>I'll sign it when I get there.</i>

00:36.585 --> 00:37.552
You motherfucker!

00:37.553 --> 00:39.888
Mr. pincus,
fucking over Mike Carlson?

00:39.889 --> 00:42.392
That has got to be
pretty fucking exciting.

00:42.393 --> 00:44.896
Kiddies, take
a good look around.

00:44.897 --> 00:46.898
By this time tomorrow,
we don't work here anymore.

00:57.682 --> 00:59.082
<i>Clyde: All right.
Doug: Photo time now?</i>

00:59.083 --> 01:00.350
Great. Perfect. All right, let's do it.

01:00.351 --> 01:01.484
Sarah: Here. All right.

01:01.485 --> 01:03.153
Uh... give me
a little smile. You know,

01:03.154 --> 01:04.622
pretend that you're enjoying
yourself. Well, no, no, no,

01:04.623 --> 01:06.024
hold on, hold on. This is
not what we talked about.

01:06.025 --> 01:07.592
And cue artsy bullshit.
What we talked about--

01:07.593 --> 01:09.995
correct me if I'm wrong--
is a stark,

01:09.996 --> 01:12.597
uninflected style, reminiscent
of late-career avedon.

01:12.598 --> 01:14.132
You said you knew who that was.

01:14.133 --> 01:15.133
I didn't.

01:15.134 --> 01:16.168
Doug, no one gives a fuck.

01:16.169 --> 01:17.937
I give an "f," okay?
Sarah: You know,

01:17.938 --> 01:19.471
why don't we just do bunny ears
and say "cheese"?

01:19.472 --> 01:21.006
Why don't we just take
this goddamn fucking picture?

01:21.007 --> 01:22.875
Everyone do bunny ears,
I'll do 'em on myself.

01:22.876 --> 01:24.410
Doug: I am. Sarah:
Well, you know, it's...

01:28.616 --> 01:30.884
Clyde: I still say
you're an idiot.

01:30.885 --> 01:32.620
Jeannie? Confirmed. Marty: Kids?

01:32.621 --> 01:33.888
Five minutes, my office, guys.

01:33.889 --> 01:35.890
Doug: "Five minutes,
my office." My God.

01:35.891 --> 01:37.057
That might be the last time
we ever hear those words.

01:37.058 --> 01:38.291
You think about that?
I'm pretty sure

01:38.292 --> 01:40.060
he'll have an office
in the new shop, right?

01:40.061 --> 01:42.830
So we're into some
endgame shit right now.

01:42.831 --> 01:44.197
We got to finesse
this a little.

01:44.198 --> 01:45.999
C-can I just suggest

01:46.000 --> 01:48.002
that this might be a good time
to take a beat?

01:48.003 --> 01:50.405
Do a really
deep drill-down

01:50.406 --> 01:52.006
and verify that
the environmentals are even ripe

01:52.007 --> 01:53.508
for a new shop; They may not be.

01:53.509 --> 01:55.710
Douglas, did someone sprinkle
a little extra pussy

01:55.711 --> 01:56.710
in your cereal this morning?

01:56.711 --> 01:57.711
This move

01:57.712 --> 01:58.712
is fucking epic,
we get it done now,

01:58.713 --> 01:59.512
correct?
Okay. No.

01:59.513 --> 02:00.913
All right.
So because

02:00.914 --> 02:02.481
I'm approaching this very
significant event

02:02.482 --> 02:03.849
with careful consideration,
I'm a pussy?

02:03.850 --> 02:05.150
I was afraid you wouldn't
catch on, but...

02:05.151 --> 02:06.818
Do you want to be uninvited
to the wedding?

02:06.819 --> 02:09.154
Keep going like this, I will
snap my fingers and you're done.

02:09.155 --> 02:10.489
That is the social
event of the season,

02:10.490 --> 02:11.757
and I need to be there. (Laughs)

02:11.758 --> 02:13.492
I've already rented my tuxedo.
Uninvited.

02:13.493 --> 02:15.328
Everybody who's everybody's gonna
be there. Take your tux back.

02:15.329 --> 02:16.763
<i>Us magazine, people
magazine... you're not coming.</i>

02:16.764 --> 02:18.565
Hey, team dipshit! Listen.

02:18.566 --> 02:20.767
Okay, here it is.

02:20.768 --> 02:23.569
Carlson is out, pincus is in.

02:25.938 --> 02:27.338
Clyde:
What?

02:27.339 --> 02:28.605
We are pulling
the deal from Carlson,

02:28.606 --> 02:30.240
and we are taking pincus
to the new shop.

02:30.241 --> 02:31.608
Bullshit.

02:31.609 --> 02:33.243
Hold on, wait.
No, pincus was out.

02:33.244 --> 02:36.879
The-the paperwork is going
to be finalized tomorrow,

02:36.880 --> 02:38.247
maybe even tonight.

02:38.248 --> 02:39.380
We're gonna keep it

02:39.381 --> 02:41.049
business as usual.
We get on that plane,

02:41.050 --> 02:42.550
take that flight to Vegas,

02:42.551 --> 02:45.286
but instead of closing Carlson,
we close pincus.

02:45.287 --> 02:46.087
Pincus.

02:46.088 --> 02:47.188
And so Carlson...

02:47.189 --> 02:48.122
Dead to us.

02:48.123 --> 02:49.256
(Makes exploding noise)

02:50.625 --> 02:51.725
Clyde:
Okay.

02:51.726 --> 02:52.860
You knew about this?

02:52.861 --> 02:55.062
Um... yeah.

02:55.063 --> 02:56.564
Marty:
As soon as that ink

02:56.565 --> 02:57.798
is dry on that contract,

02:57.799 --> 03:00.201
it is buh-bye, Carlson. Doug: Right.

03:00.202 --> 03:01.468
Buh-bye, galweather stearn.

03:01.469 --> 03:02.803
(Makes exploding noise)

03:02.804 --> 03:04.305
Marty: Are you excited?
Doug: Yes!

03:04.306 --> 03:06.474
(Laughs):
Yes!

03:06.475 --> 03:08.476
You know what, buddy?
I'm gonna need you

03:08.477 --> 03:10.144
to break that down for me...

03:11.180 --> 03:12.781
How are you holding up?

03:12.782 --> 03:14.482
What?

03:14.483 --> 03:15.617
You know, post-Tamara.

03:15.618 --> 03:16.818
Oh. Fuck that.

03:16.819 --> 03:19.621
Get your purse,
I want to show you something.

03:21.557 --> 03:23.425
Here it is.

03:23.426 --> 03:24.626
(Laughs)

03:24.627 --> 03:26.462
I don't have to say a word

03:26.463 --> 03:27.964
when I show a
property like this,

03:27.965 --> 03:30.366
because it's... I mean,
look at this view.

03:30.367 --> 03:32.335
The light, the space--

03:32.336 --> 03:33.870
it sells itself, really,
a space like this.

03:33.871 --> 03:35.205
And the building...

03:35.206 --> 03:36.706
<i>I thought you weren't
gonna say a word.</i>

03:36.707 --> 03:39.109
Didn't he say there's
gonna be no words, (Laughs)

03:39.110 --> 03:40.710
And then words just
blah-blah-blah.

03:40.711 --> 03:42.712
(Chuckles)

03:42.713 --> 03:44.414
(Sighs)

03:45.449 --> 03:46.883
I like it.

03:46.884 --> 03:48.318
Do you?

03:48.319 --> 03:49.319
Me, too.

03:49.320 --> 03:51.321
I'm just wondering,

03:51.322 --> 03:53.156
is it a bit big for us?

03:53.157 --> 03:56.526
Well, honey, it's not
just gonna be us forever.

03:56.527 --> 03:58.462
Oh, honey.

03:58.463 --> 03:59.863
I mean, we got to think
about the little ones.

03:59.864 --> 04:01.231
Are you saying
what I think you're saying?

04:01.232 --> 04:02.132
Doug.

04:02.133 --> 04:03.968
Clyde.

04:03.969 --> 04:05.670
Oh, my God,
those are the exact names.

04:05.671 --> 04:06.837
<i>I picked out!</i>

04:06.838 --> 04:09.207
(Laughs):
Honey.

04:09.208 --> 04:10.975
<i>Doug: I mean...
Clyde: You remember?</i>

04:10.976 --> 04:12.844
<i>She turned to me and said,
"you ever leave me,</i>

04:12.845 --> 04:14.679
I'll kill myself."
(Laughter)

04:14.680 --> 04:16.714
Sarah: I said,
"I'll kill you."

04:16.714 --> 04:18.048
Is that what it was?

04:18.050 --> 04:19.584
You do like me, huh?

04:19.584 --> 04:21.586
(Spoon tapping on glass)

04:21.587 --> 04:23.688
If I could say a few words,
if that's fine?

04:23.689 --> 04:24.689
Yeah.
Okay.

04:24.690 --> 04:25.690
All right, shoot.

04:25.691 --> 04:26.824
Well, first of all,

04:26.825 --> 04:29.927
I think after Sarah
got over her intense

04:29.928 --> 04:31.663
attraction to me...

04:31.664 --> 04:33.031
(Laughs) ...She did really well,

04:33.032 --> 04:34.365
settling for her second choice,

04:34.366 --> 04:35.533
Doug guggenheim.

04:35.534 --> 04:36.401
Thank you.
Enough

04:36.402 --> 04:38.336
about my unbelievable
magnetism,

04:38.337 --> 04:41.873
except to say to the ladies
that I am single

04:41.874 --> 04:43.908
and available
for one night only, tonight.

04:43.909 --> 04:45.677
Molly? Okay? Okay.

04:45.678 --> 04:46.945
I'll see you there;
Start stretching now.

04:46.946 --> 04:48.146
Doug:
Inappropriate.

04:48.147 --> 04:49.547
Clyde:
I'll get on track, I'm sorry.

04:51.717 --> 04:53.084
Doug guggenheim...

04:56.522 --> 04:58.689
Doug guggenheim is
my best friend.

04:58.690 --> 05:02.260
Fuck. I hate to admit it,
but it's true, man.

05:02.261 --> 05:05.830
And even harder to admit is...
That I admire him.

05:07.433 --> 05:08.633
I'm gonna throw up.

05:08.634 --> 05:09.968
You okay? Ugh, I can feel it

05:09.969 --> 05:10.969
coming up a little bit.

05:10.970 --> 05:12.471
(Burps)
I might really throw up.

05:12.472 --> 05:14.439
I just have never said
those words out loud before.

05:14.440 --> 05:15.607
But you know what?
It's true.

05:15.608 --> 05:16.642
All of that is true.

05:16.643 --> 05:17.976
I absolutely admire him.

05:17.977 --> 05:21.980
I mean, in this horrible,
cynical, dying world,

05:21.981 --> 05:23.582
Doug's utter lack of irony

05:23.583 --> 05:26.384
and his complete
and total devotion to Sarah,

05:26.385 --> 05:29.153
his unwillingness
to let his fear of the future

05:29.154 --> 05:32.590
topple the love
and desire he has to spend

05:32.591 --> 05:34.058
the rest of his life
with someone

05:34.059 --> 05:36.994
that he truly cares about--
someone that he truly loves--

05:36.995 --> 05:39.463
I mean, that is
something that is completely

05:39.464 --> 05:40.665
foreign to me.

05:40.666 --> 05:42.066
And heroic.

05:42.067 --> 05:45.336
And I'm really,
really happy for him.

05:45.337 --> 05:47.472
I'm happy for both of you.

05:47.473 --> 05:48.840
(Exhales) Wow.

05:48.841 --> 05:49.908
(Laughs)

05:49.909 --> 05:50.909
Clyde:
Uh, let's go.

05:50.910 --> 05:52.510
Put your alcohol in your hand,

05:52.511 --> 05:53.679
raise it, elevate it...

05:53.680 --> 05:54.780
(All murmuring) All right. Here we go.

05:54.781 --> 05:56.148
To my best friend Doug

05:56.149 --> 05:58.150
and his beautiful wife Sarah. Aw.

05:58.151 --> 05:59.152
Cheers.

05:59.153 --> 06:00.486
All:
Cheers.

06:00.487 --> 06:01.588
Doug and Sarah.

06:04.125 --> 06:05.759
Oh, wow. Well...

06:05.760 --> 06:06.961
I wish you'd told me...

06:06.962 --> 06:07.962
(Clyde laughs)

06:07.963 --> 06:09.363
Hey.

06:09.364 --> 06:10.364
Hey.

06:10.365 --> 06:12.599
Can I talk to you for a sec?

06:12.600 --> 06:13.867
Uh, yeah.

06:13.868 --> 06:15.869
Yeah.

06:15.870 --> 06:17.371
Give me a little smile.

06:17.372 --> 06:18.672
You know, pretend that you're
enjoying yourself. (Laughs)

06:18.673 --> 06:20.141
Why don't we just do bunny ears
and say "cheese"?

06:20.142 --> 06:21.676
Why don't we just take this
goddamn fucking picture?

06:21.677 --> 06:23.545
Everyone do bunny ears,
I'll do 'em on myself.

06:23.546 --> 06:26.482
You know what?

06:27.818 --> 06:29.352
And, of course,
Marty is amazing.

06:29.353 --> 06:31.487
You know, he's Marty kaan.

06:31.488 --> 06:32.488
He's-he's the man.

06:32.489 --> 06:34.991
He's the-the...
Kaan man.

06:34.992 --> 06:36.760
You know,
he's got the-the magic,

06:36.761 --> 06:38.095
the-the touch.

06:38.096 --> 06:39.296
He's got the killer body,
you know.

06:39.297 --> 06:41.297
Honey... I just feel
like I'm making such

06:41.298 --> 06:43.666
traction at galweather.

06:43.667 --> 06:47.237
Yesterday, I had the most
fantastic conversation

06:47.238 --> 06:49.806
with julianne...
As I brought in her cappuccino.

06:49.807 --> 06:52.875
But maybe I should stay
with the pod, you know?

06:52.876 --> 06:54.310
We're on such a hot
streak right now.

06:54.311 --> 06:55.945
It's almost like we're
the fantastic four.

06:55.946 --> 06:58.047
(Laughs):
You know?

06:58.048 --> 06:59.716
What am I saying?

06:59.717 --> 07:01.651
It's exactly like
we're the fantastic four.

07:01.652 --> 07:03.287
(Sighs) God, think about it.

07:03.288 --> 07:05.155
Marty's Reed Richards,
of course, you know?

07:05.156 --> 07:08.158
I'm Johnny storm. "Flame on."
That's classic Doug.

07:08.159 --> 07:09.159
(Chuckles)

07:09.160 --> 07:10.560
And Jeannie's sue storm, so...

07:10.561 --> 07:11.695
They're brother and sister,

07:11.696 --> 07:13.897
so nothing going on there.

07:13.898 --> 07:16.366
And-and, you know, Clyde is
obviously the thing, Ben grimm.

07:16.367 --> 07:17.367
And our superpowers

07:17.368 --> 07:19.570
all complement one another.

07:19.571 --> 07:21.572
So I guess that's an argument
for going with Marty.

07:21.573 --> 07:23.340
God, to break that up
would be a tragedy.

07:23.341 --> 07:25.041
Mm. Right? There's no fantastic three.

07:25.042 --> 07:26.042
I mean, for alliteration
sake alone...

07:26.043 --> 07:27.043
You know what, sweetheart...

07:27.044 --> 07:28.178
I know, I know. I...

07:28.179 --> 07:29.946
Superheroes aren't real,
most of them.

07:29.947 --> 07:30.947
Enjoy.
Oh, actually...

07:30.948 --> 07:32.081
Excuse me, is dessert included?

07:34.451 --> 07:36.786
(Sobbing):
Oh, my God!

07:38.756 --> 07:39.756
Yes!

07:39.757 --> 07:40.924
Uh! Yes!

07:40.925 --> 07:42.125
Yes!
Oh, my God!

07:42.126 --> 07:43.560
(Laughs):
Oh, my God!

07:43.561 --> 07:44.561
Look!

07:44.562 --> 07:46.396
(Applause)

07:46.397 --> 07:48.465
Yes!
Oh. Mm, mm!

07:48.466 --> 07:49.466
(Crowd murmuring)

07:49.467 --> 07:50.767
(Whoops)

07:50.768 --> 07:51.768
Oh, my...
It's beautiful.

07:51.769 --> 07:52.903
It's perfect.

07:52.904 --> 07:53.937
Ooh, just...

07:53.938 --> 07:55.405
Let's do it tomorrow. Huh?

07:55.406 --> 07:56.439
Let's just do this.

07:56.440 --> 07:58.708
Let's get married
in Vegas, tomorrow,

07:58.709 --> 08:01.310
on your trip,
because I want to be.

08:01.311 --> 08:03.613
Mrs. Doug guggenheim...

08:03.614 --> 08:04.614
Yesterday!

08:04.615 --> 08:06.516
Let's do it!

08:06.517 --> 08:07.917
Let's just... do you...

08:07.918 --> 08:10.253
You want to just
do this, right?

08:10.254 --> 08:11.788
<i>Jeannie:
Let me get this straight.</i>

08:11.789 --> 08:14.657
You did not intend
to propose to Sarah,

08:14.658 --> 08:16.692
yet you left the restaurant
with another girl's ring?

08:16.693 --> 08:17.960
What was I supposed to do?

08:17.961 --> 08:19.362
Oh, my God!
Oh, I don't know, tell her?

08:19.363 --> 08:20.563
You don't understand.

08:20.564 --> 08:21.931
There were people
clapping and applauding.

08:21.932 --> 08:23.032
There was nothing I could do.

08:23.033 --> 08:24.266
That was it. That
was... Clyde: Oh, my God.

08:24.267 --> 08:25.768
I just figured it out.

08:25.769 --> 08:26.902
You cheap motherfucker!

08:26.903 --> 08:28.303
You didn't tell Sarah

08:28.304 --> 08:30.405
because you got a free ring
out of the deal! Doug...

08:30.406 --> 08:31.406
What?! No!
No?

08:31.407 --> 08:32.474
No.
No?

08:32.475 --> 08:34.009
Absolutely not...

08:34.010 --> 08:35.010
Entirely.

08:35.010 --> 08:36.544
Not entirely.
No. No.

08:36.546 --> 08:37.813
Oh, shit.
That is...

08:37.813 --> 08:39.080
You know, she's already invited
all her friends.

08:39.081 --> 08:40.548
That's it. That's done.

08:40.549 --> 08:42.984
And she's in Vegas, right now,
taking care of everything.

08:42.985 --> 08:44.485
It's-it's... I...

08:44.486 --> 08:46.221
God, it's just moving so fast.

08:46.222 --> 08:47.689
And I love her, you know that.

08:47.690 --> 08:49.090
And I want to marry her. Yes. Of course.

08:49.091 --> 08:50.591
And you got a free
ring out of the deal.

08:50.592 --> 08:52.627
Doug: I did. I did,
and that's nice.

08:52.628 --> 08:54.195
Clyde: I still say
you're an idiot.

08:54.196 --> 08:56.230
Jeannie? Confirmed. Marty: Kids?

08:56.231 --> 08:58.532
My office, five minutes. Doug:
"Five minutes, my office." My God.

08:58.533 --> 08:59.800
That might be the last time

08:59.801 --> 09:01.401
we ever hear those words.
You think about that?

09:01.402 --> 09:03.003
I'm pretty sure he'll have an
office in the new shop, right?

09:03.004 --> 09:04.872
Oh, shit, actually... Marty!
Hey, Marty!

09:04.873 --> 09:06.707
Marty. Marty.
I'm sorry.

09:06.708 --> 09:08.442
Just, uh, about tonight...

09:08.443 --> 09:09.977
I would be honored

09:09.978 --> 09:12.280
if you would do a
reading in my wedding.

09:12.281 --> 09:13.648
Think kahlil gibran, you know?

09:13.649 --> 09:15.049
I even had a passage
picked out.

09:15.050 --> 09:16.484
"Even as the strings
of the lute are alone

09:16.485 --> 09:18.186
"though they quiver
with the same

09:18.187 --> 09:19.921
music, it..."
Think about it.

09:19.922 --> 09:22.357
So... okay.

09:22.358 --> 09:24.359
(Bagpipes playing
"bridal chorus")

09:31.835 --> 09:33.837
(Camera clicking)

09:42.880 --> 09:44.847
(Exhales) (Chuckles)

09:45.916 --> 09:47.951
With this ring,

09:47.952 --> 09:50.420
I do commit myself to you

09:50.421 --> 09:53.022
as your everlasting lover.

09:53.023 --> 09:55.425
May it encircle your finger

09:55.426 --> 09:57.527
the way I will encircle you.

09:57.528 --> 10:00.096
(Both sigh)

10:00.097 --> 10:02.131
Here you go. Yeah, just...

10:05.536 --> 10:07.537
(Clears throat)

10:07.538 --> 10:10.139
Hey, Sarah, when this is all
over, can I talk to you more

10:10.140 --> 10:12.074
about this work thing?
Doug, we need to talk.

10:12.075 --> 10:13.075
Oh, shit, I'm sorry.
No, I'm sorry.

10:13.076 --> 10:14.143
I shouldn't have
talked about work.

10:14.144 --> 10:15.144
I'm sorry, so stupid.
No, no, no...

10:15.145 --> 10:16.145
Would you just give us a minute.

10:16.146 --> 10:17.680
Sure, yes.

10:17.681 --> 10:20.416
I just to talk to you...
I said I was sorry, I...

10:20.417 --> 10:22.217
Officiant:
It's okay, cold feet sometimes.

10:22.218 --> 10:24.587
Are... are you okay?
Yeah, I'm fine.

10:24.588 --> 10:27.490
Hey, can you please stop taking
the-the photos, sir, please?

10:29.226 --> 10:30.893
What?

10:30.894 --> 10:32.561
(Sighs)

10:32.562 --> 10:33.962
Doug, I lied.

10:33.963 --> 10:35.964
Oh, shit-- Clyde was right.

10:35.965 --> 10:37.433
What did Clyde say?

10:37.434 --> 10:38.668
Well, that you probably

10:38.669 --> 10:40.503
have a rap sheet
and at least two kids.

10:40.504 --> 10:43.306
Oh... no, but that's
good to know.

10:43.307 --> 10:45.675
(Laughs):
Oh, my God, I was worried.

10:47.578 --> 10:48.578
What?

10:48.579 --> 10:51.681
Well, the proposal?

10:51.682 --> 10:53.183
Yeah.

10:53.184 --> 10:55.585
It wasn't exactly fate.

10:56.687 --> 10:58.922
I orchestrated it.

10:58.923 --> 11:01.291
Okay.

11:03.961 --> 11:05.695
Wait, you bought the ring?

11:05.696 --> 11:06.796
Yes.

11:08.833 --> 11:10.267
Oh, my... and it's paid for?

11:10.268 --> 11:12.536
Yes.

11:12.537 --> 11:15.039
It is.
Okay.

11:15.040 --> 11:16.440
I just didn't want to be

11:16.441 --> 11:18.843
the girl who gets bitter
while she's sitting around

11:18.844 --> 11:20.878
waiting for a proposal,
but then I realized

11:20.879 --> 11:22.780
this is not really the best...

11:22.781 --> 11:24.682
That's pretty bat-shit
crazy, Sarah.

11:24.683 --> 11:27.118
I know that it is.

11:27.119 --> 11:28.219
I'm crazy.

11:28.220 --> 11:31.957
You don't have
to marry me tonight,

11:31.958 --> 11:34.626
but I really, really
need you to forgive me,

11:34.627 --> 11:37.696
because I don't...

11:37.697 --> 11:40.966
I don't know what I would do
if I lost you.

11:52.313 --> 11:55.181
Well, no one's ever been scared
of losing me before.

11:56.451 --> 11:57.484
(Laughs)

11:57.485 --> 11:59.219
Of course I'll marry you.

11:59.220 --> 12:01.254
(Laughing)

12:01.255 --> 12:02.689
Don't...

12:02.690 --> 12:04.091
With this ring,

12:04.092 --> 12:06.493
I marry this
smoking hot motherfucker.

12:06.494 --> 12:07.595
Officiant: Now
by the power

12:07.596 --> 12:09.363
vested in me excuse me.

12:09.364 --> 12:12.900
By the state of Nevada,
I now pronounce you husband

12:12.901 --> 12:15.036
and wife. You may
kiss the bride.

12:15.037 --> 12:16.705
(Crowd whooping)

12:16.706 --> 12:17.906
Give me a little smile,
you know,

12:17.907 --> 12:19.407
pretend that you're
enjoying yourself.

12:19.408 --> 12:21.876
Why don't we just do bunny ears
and say "cheese"?

12:21.877 --> 12:24.212
Why don't we just take
this goddamn fucking picture?

12:24.213 --> 12:26.081
I'll do 'em on myself, okay?

12:28.518 --> 12:30.219
Marty:
Buh-bye, Carlson.

12:30.220 --> 12:32.421
Buh-bye, galweather stearn.

12:32.422 --> 12:34.857
(Laughs):
Yes.

12:34.858 --> 12:36.125
You know what, buddy,
I'm gonna need you

12:36.126 --> 12:37.527
to break that down for me.

12:37.528 --> 12:39.262
Carlson is what? That Carlson
deal was every bit as much mine

12:39.263 --> 12:40.396
as it was that motherfucker's.

12:40.397 --> 12:41.965
How does he have the right
to fucking steal it

12:41.966 --> 12:42.966
right from underneath me?

12:42.967 --> 12:44.134
Right, every bit as much yours?

12:44.135 --> 12:46.636
No, I mean, yeah, every
bit as much yours.

12:46.637 --> 12:47.838
Everything is fucked up.

12:47.839 --> 12:49.106
The dushkins twins--
that's gonna be fucked up.

12:49.107 --> 12:50.674
The bank that I make
off that fucking deal--

12:50.675 --> 12:51.909
that's gonna be fucked up.

12:51.910 --> 12:53.544
This was supposed to be
a game-changer for me, and

12:53.545 --> 12:56.147
he just does whatever the fuck
he wants without even thinking.

12:56.148 --> 12:57.816
Anytime he wants, he just pulls
the fucking rip cord.

12:57.817 --> 12:59.150
He doesn't even...

12:59.151 --> 13:01.787
And I thought
my thing with Marty

13:01.788 --> 13:03.589
was just on a whole
nother level, man.

13:03.590 --> 13:05.057
I thought as friends, as equals.

13:05.058 --> 13:06.325
But it turns out,

13:06.326 --> 13:07.359
I'm a fucking idiot.

13:07.360 --> 13:08.994
He doesn't give a fuck about me.

13:08.995 --> 13:10.195
I know, classic Marty, huh?

13:11.298 --> 13:12.364
No, yeah, he's an asshole.

13:17.237 --> 13:19.071
See you guys in a minute.
Doug: See you guys.

13:19.072 --> 13:20.806
(Mouthing)

13:22.442 --> 13:24.976
<i>Clyde: I was a huge part
of making that deal happen,</i>

13:24.977 --> 13:26.845
and Marty did
an end run around me,

13:26.846 --> 13:28.847
totally fucking me over
with those guys.

13:28.848 --> 13:29.748
Their name is douchebag?

13:29.749 --> 13:30.915
That is... (Laughs)

13:30.916 --> 13:32.617
That is unfortunate.

13:32.618 --> 13:34.419
Their last name is dushkin; We
call them douchebags because...

13:34.420 --> 13:35.687
I don't care.
Okay.

13:35.688 --> 13:37.956
The headline of this is
just Marty's total

13:37.957 --> 13:40.292
lack of gratitude for
the hard work that I put in

13:40.293 --> 13:43.862
every fucking day,
his absence of reciprocity...

13:46.266 --> 13:48.200
All right, Mrs. Robinson,
what's up?

13:48.201 --> 13:50.035
You could be very soon.

13:51.037 --> 13:52.938
Nah.

13:52.939 --> 13:55.941
I am so bored right now.

13:55.942 --> 13:58.143
I did not agree to this lunch

13:58.144 --> 14:00.479
to play shrinky-mommy to
your man-crush on Marty kaan.

14:00.480 --> 14:01.914
He breaks hearts,
you know that.

14:01.915 --> 14:03.215
Stop being such a little bitch.

14:03.216 --> 14:04.617
I don't think I'm being
a bitch right now.

14:04.618 --> 14:06.986
Your so-called instrumental
role in this deal--

14:06.987 --> 14:09.523
at the end of the day,
what was it really?

14:09.524 --> 14:11.091
If I hadn't introduced him
to the douchebags,

14:11.092 --> 14:12.492
he would've never met Carlson.

14:12.493 --> 14:14.528
Come on. You don't think
he just would've found

14:14.529 --> 14:16.063
another way to Carlson?

14:16.064 --> 14:17.097
But he didn't.

14:17.098 --> 14:18.565
Why should he
take you seriously?

14:18.566 --> 14:21.936
Better yet... why should I?

14:24.105 --> 14:27.407
Because I'm about
to make you mountains of cash.

14:29.377 --> 14:30.911
Give me a little smile,
you know, pretend that

14:30.912 --> 14:31.979
you're enjoying yourself.
Why don't we just

14:31.980 --> 14:33.314
do bunny ears and say "cheese"?

14:33.315 --> 14:34.982
Why don't we just take this
goddamn fucking picture?

14:34.983 --> 14:36.044
Photographer:
Everyone, do bunny ears.

14:50.233 --> 14:51.666
Hi, Marty.

14:51.667 --> 14:53.468
Hey, julianne.

14:53.469 --> 14:54.502
Oh, I left

14:54.503 --> 14:55.737
my car parked...

14:55.738 --> 14:57.172
Ah, come hither.

14:57.173 --> 14:58.606
Come on, come on.

14:58.607 --> 15:00.408
I'm not gonna hurt you.

15:00.409 --> 15:01.876
Not too bad.

15:01.877 --> 15:05.046
Right.

15:05.047 --> 15:06.647
God, you know, I just...

15:06.648 --> 15:10.251
I just had the most interesting
conversation with Mike Carlson.

15:10.252 --> 15:13.821
He said you two went hunting.

15:13.822 --> 15:15.422
Okay.

15:15.423 --> 15:17.624
Apparently you made quite
an impression on him.

15:17.625 --> 15:19.727
You know, okay, he
said-- and I'm...

15:19.728 --> 15:22.863
I'm gonna quote here--
he is looking forward to

15:22.864 --> 15:26.066
"loads more playtime
with Marty."

15:26.067 --> 15:27.201
Yeah.

15:27.202 --> 15:28.468
Here's what I'm thinking.

15:28.469 --> 15:30.203
I think that Carlson

15:30.204 --> 15:32.406
is gonna keep galweather
on to handle

15:32.407 --> 15:35.609
the after-work on the
online casino acquisition.

15:35.610 --> 15:37.410
That's what I'm thinking.

15:37.411 --> 15:38.711
I think...
Okay.

15:38.712 --> 15:40.913
That Mike Carlson is as crazy
as a shit-house rat

15:40.914 --> 15:43.249
and he's willing to pay
top dollar to toy

15:43.250 --> 15:45.651
with me for his own
fucked-up amusement.

15:45.652 --> 15:47.887
As long as we get paid, right?

15:47.888 --> 15:48.921
You know what?

15:48.922 --> 15:49.922
Right!
Right!

15:49.923 --> 15:50.957
Oh!
(Laughs)

15:50.958 --> 15:52.291
Goon! Oh.

15:52.292 --> 15:53.292
Zala!

15:53.293 --> 15:54.527
(Laughs):
Okay.

15:56.563 --> 15:59.165
(Talking quietly)

15:59.166 --> 16:01.100
Oh, Tammy.
Okay.

16:01.101 --> 16:02.134
That's for you.

16:02.135 --> 16:03.869
Ah.

16:03.870 --> 16:05.604
This is travel for Vegas.

16:05.605 --> 16:07.673
You can read.
Can you fuck off for a second?

16:07.674 --> 16:09.942
Thank you.
Marty, I'm not

16:09.943 --> 16:12.144
going to Vegas after you
fucked me on the Carlson deal.

16:12.145 --> 16:14.079
So you can get one
of your lackeys to carry

16:14.080 --> 16:15.247
your goddamn briefcase.

16:15.248 --> 16:17.482
Oh, baby girl, not only
are you gonna go to Vegas,

16:17.483 --> 16:18.984
but you're gonna wear
a big fucking smile

16:18.985 --> 16:21.252
while you're holding
my briefcase

16:21.253 --> 16:23.588
or I will blow up
your goddamn deal at demark.

16:23.589 --> 16:25.223
Boom!

16:25.224 --> 16:26.324
See you in Vegas.

16:26.325 --> 16:28.359
Clyde:
I still say you're

16:28.360 --> 16:30.294
an idiot-- Jeannie?
Confirmed.

16:30.295 --> 16:32.497
Kids? Five minutes
in my office, please?

16:32.498 --> 16:34.932
Okay. "Five minutes, my office."
My God.

16:34.933 --> 16:36.767
That might be the last time
we ever hear those words.

16:36.768 --> 16:38.202
You think about that? I'm pretty
sure he'll have an office...

16:38.203 --> 16:40.671
What, another one?

16:40.672 --> 16:42.539
What else do you have
up your sleeve?

16:42.540 --> 16:43.673
Come on.

16:43.674 --> 16:45.008
Open.

16:45.009 --> 16:47.010
Oh, my God.
Oh, good.

16:47.011 --> 16:50.113
Oh, my God. Look
at the detailing!

16:50.114 --> 16:53.115
That's where I aced
risk and statistical analysis.

16:53.116 --> 16:55.351
It's perfect.
You're perfect.

16:55.352 --> 16:56.285
Marty:
That's...

16:56.286 --> 16:57.786
Clyde:
That's fucking Harvard.

16:57.787 --> 17:01.723
Sarah got a cake made
in the shape of Harvard.

17:01.724 --> 17:03.191
I wouldn't have done that.
Clyde: And look at

17:03.192 --> 17:05.226
the bobble heads;
They act just like them.

17:05.227 --> 17:07.494
(Clyde and Marty
make silly sounds)

17:07.496 --> 17:09.497
As long as it's not lemon,
I don't give a rat's ass.

17:09.498 --> 17:10.565
Everyone say "Harvard."

17:10.566 --> 17:11.532
Yeah!

17:11.534 --> 17:13.501
All:
Harvard!

17:13.502 --> 17:15.169
Harvard. All right.

17:15.170 --> 17:16.204
Come on, Mrs. guggenheim.

17:16.204 --> 17:18.540
We're celebrating this.

17:18.540 --> 17:20.509
So what's up with
the pincus deal-- you close?

17:20.510 --> 17:21.577
It's looking good.

17:21.578 --> 17:23.212
I'm waiting for a call
from the lawyers.

17:23.213 --> 17:24.646
We're close.
When have you ever waited, okay?

17:24.647 --> 17:25.714
Can you chill out?
I'm gone...

17:25.715 --> 17:27.282
Chill out.
Yeah, but it's...

17:35.526 --> 17:37.393
No.

17:41.498 --> 17:43.466
Fuck.

17:49.273 --> 17:51.274
(Spanish accent):
Room service.

17:53.410 --> 17:55.278
Hi. (Normal voice): Hey.

17:55.279 --> 17:57.347
Real fucking cute telling
julianne about the deal.

17:57.348 --> 17:58.615
I don't know what you're
talking about. You don't...?

17:58.616 --> 18:00.584
Don't bullshit me, Tamara.

18:00.585 --> 18:03.720
My fucking e-mails are gone,
my account has been wiped out.

18:03.721 --> 18:05.522
I can't get back
on the server, the...

18:05.523 --> 18:06.756
My phone doesn't even work.

18:06.757 --> 18:07.991
But you can bet your
ass I'll borrow

18:07.992 --> 18:09.092
a phone and call demark.

18:09.093 --> 18:10.594
Marty, why would I
ever do that to you?

18:10.595 --> 18:13.296
Don't fucking
play with... oh.

18:13.297 --> 18:14.898
Ain't this about a bitch.
Hey, Marty.

18:14.899 --> 18:15.866
Hey, Kevin.

18:15.867 --> 18:16.867
Yeah, little lovers' getaway?

18:16.868 --> 18:18.835
Hey, man, you made
her come to Vegas

18:18.836 --> 18:20.203
for this bullshit,
so all that attitude,

18:20.204 --> 18:21.705
you can probably lose it.

18:21.706 --> 18:23.707
Yeah, I did make her fucking
come... please, honey.

18:23.708 --> 18:26.376
Babe, please.
It doesn't matter.

18:26.377 --> 18:28.378
Yeah, it doesn't matter, kev.

18:31.282 --> 18:33.816
Marty, I would never
do that to you.

18:33.817 --> 18:37.287
We have way too much history.

18:37.288 --> 18:39.856
I would never.

18:42.593 --> 18:44.827
(Chuckles)

18:44.828 --> 18:46.963
Have a great night.

18:46.964 --> 18:49.665
Clyde: Let's go, put your
alcohol in your hand, raise it,

18:49.666 --> 18:51.500
elevate it, okay? Doug:
All right, come on, yeah.

18:51.501 --> 18:53.302
I could use this.
Okay.

18:53.303 --> 18:57.072
To my best friend Doug
and his beautiful wife Sarah.

18:57.073 --> 18:58.307
Man:
Yeah.

18:58.308 --> 18:59.608
I say cheers.

18:59.609 --> 19:01.810
All:
Cheers.

19:01.811 --> 19:04.346
Doug: Wow, Clyde,
that was, uh...

19:04.347 --> 19:06.115
Oh, my God, if I'd known
it was gonna be like that...

19:06.116 --> 19:08.383
Can I talk to you for a second?

19:08.384 --> 19:09.652
Uh, yeah.

19:13.290 --> 19:14.590
What's up?

19:14.591 --> 19:16.592
I, um...

19:16.593 --> 19:17.593
Not much.

19:17.594 --> 19:19.362
Oh, okay, 'cause, Jeannie,

19:19.363 --> 19:21.431
the shit's kind of hitting
the fan right now, so...

19:21.432 --> 19:22.599
I broke up with Nate.

19:22.600 --> 19:24.033
Dildo king?

19:24.034 --> 19:25.201
Yeah.
Okay.

19:25.202 --> 19:26.470
So, no royal wedding?

19:26.471 --> 19:28.405
No, I don't think so, no.

19:31.509 --> 19:32.343
You drunk?

19:32.344 --> 19:34.311
No, I'm not drunk enough.

19:34.312 --> 19:35.913
Okay, so...?
Um, Marty,

19:35.914 --> 19:37.682
that night...

19:37.683 --> 19:40.652
The... you know, the night
the merger fell through,

19:40.653 --> 19:42.687
and I blew the whistle
on the rainmaker? Yeah.

19:42.688 --> 19:44.222
Yes.
Yes, that night,

19:44.223 --> 19:46.124
I said something to you.

19:47.693 --> 19:50.061
I was totally wasted

19:50.062 --> 19:52.831
and vulnerable and scared,
but I meant it, meant...

19:52.832 --> 19:55.734
What I said, and I'm

19:55.735 --> 19:58.669
now done minimizing it

19:58.670 --> 20:02.373
and rationalizing and
thinking instead of feeling.

20:02.374 --> 20:04.408
I love you.

20:08.079 --> 20:09.747
I love you.

20:09.748 --> 20:11.248
Jesus, Jeannie.

20:11.249 --> 20:12.817
"Jesus, Jeannie."

20:12.818 --> 20:14.252
That's all you've got?

20:14.253 --> 20:16.855
Are you fucking kidding me?
You're gonna do this right now?

20:16.856 --> 20:19.725
Julianne wiped out
all my fucking files,

20:19.726 --> 20:21.627
pincus deal isn't closed yet,

20:21.628 --> 20:23.429
and then you're gonna
pick right now

20:23.430 --> 20:25.531
to tell me about
your schoolgirl crush?

20:29.836 --> 20:31.804
Hmm.

20:34.741 --> 20:37.143
That night, I...

20:41.682 --> 20:44.250
You said you loved me back.

20:44.251 --> 20:46.052
I know you were drunk, too,

20:46.053 --> 20:49.455
but you meant it,
Marty, I know you did.

20:49.456 --> 20:51.757
Don't just stand here
with your files erased

20:51.758 --> 20:54.260
and no one caring when
you come home at night,

20:54.261 --> 20:56.129
thinking that your
life is manageable.

20:56.130 --> 20:59.232
Don't tell me, Marty,
that you don't know

20:59.233 --> 21:02.068
that there's something here,
and that whatever it is,

21:02.069 --> 21:04.404
just has you too scared
to move a muscle.

21:04.405 --> 21:05.505
Jeannie, what do you want?

21:05.506 --> 21:07.006
Just don't.
What do you want me to...

21:07.007 --> 21:09.141
Don't. No.
Jeannie.

21:09.142 --> 21:10.543
Jeannie...

21:14.314 --> 21:17.115
Doug: Um, uh, hey, Marty,
I need to talk to you.

21:17.116 --> 21:19.650
No, no, not now. This is
not a good time right now.

21:19.651 --> 21:22.153
No, no, no, please don't tell me
it's not a good time.

21:22.154 --> 21:24.288
And don't tell me to,
"shut the fuck up, Doug,"

21:24.289 --> 21:26.224
okay, because this is
my wedding night

21:26.225 --> 21:28.192
and I just need
a moment of your time.

21:28.193 --> 21:29.827
Okay, go on.

21:29.828 --> 21:31.429
Okay. Obviously,
you're my mentor...

21:31.430 --> 21:34.031
Doug, I'm not your
fucking mentor.

21:34.032 --> 21:35.233
No more jokes, okay?

21:35.234 --> 21:38.736
No off-switch, this guy.
I'm serious.

21:38.737 --> 21:41.272
It often comes as a blow
when a very special mentee

21:41.273 --> 21:43.708
says, "hey, I'm gonna take
everything my sensei taught me,

21:43.709 --> 21:45.843
spread my wings and move on."

21:45.844 --> 21:49.614
Well, in my case, I have
decided to spread my wings

21:49.615 --> 21:51.482
and stay at galweather.

21:56.388 --> 21:57.622
That's great.

21:57.623 --> 22:00.024
This was not an easy decision
for me to make, okay?

22:00.025 --> 22:02.559
And I am super grateful
for everything you've taught me,

22:02.560 --> 22:04.628
but this is something
I absolutely have to do.

22:04.629 --> 22:05.796
I understand, Doug,
I understand.

22:05.797 --> 22:07.331
God. Bring it in.
What are you doing?

22:07.332 --> 22:08.999
Tuck it in. I don't want to tuck it in.

22:09.000 --> 22:10.000
Mad love, Marty.

22:10.001 --> 22:11.468
Doug, you got...
Let me.

22:13.037 --> 22:15.137
I know you're hurting,
Marty. I know.

22:15.138 --> 22:16.305
Yo.

22:29.218 --> 22:31.653
What are you doing?

22:31.654 --> 22:34.556
I had a feeling julianne
would hit up all your files,

22:34.557 --> 22:37.458
so I backed you up
on a zip drive.

22:37.459 --> 22:40.160
I kept it with me.
It just slipped. There it is.

22:40.161 --> 22:41.962
Just give it to me later,
Jeannie.

22:41.963 --> 22:43.931
I, um, (Sniffles)

22:43.932 --> 22:46.067
I really don't want
to see to you later.

22:46.068 --> 22:47.302
Just take it.

22:49.038 --> 22:50.638
Come on, jea...

22:54.978 --> 22:56.211
Sarah:
...Absolutely perfect,

22:56.212 --> 22:58.381
because that's the way
that, um...

22:58.382 --> 22:59.315
Hey-hey, you two.

22:59.316 --> 23:01.417
Hey, Jeannie, I need
to get everyone

23:01.418 --> 23:03.252
from galweather together
for a photo...

23:03.253 --> 23:05.087
Marty, you're the last
piece of the puzzle.

23:05.088 --> 23:06.889
I had problems with this. Okay.

23:06.890 --> 23:08.457
I don't want to do the
same-- what are you doing?

23:08.458 --> 23:10.960
You know what? Can I just
get you to start it off?

23:10.961 --> 23:11.961
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

23:11.962 --> 23:13.062
Doug, Doug?
Hmm?

23:13.063 --> 23:15.065
You have a phone?
Oh, Marty, of course.

23:15.066 --> 23:17.000
It is the least I can do. Great.

23:17.001 --> 23:18.334
Do you feel better?

23:18.335 --> 23:20.236
I always feel better
after a good cry.

23:20.237 --> 23:21.538
One second. I got it.

23:21.539 --> 23:23.540
(Scottish accent):
That is deep in the sporran.

23:23.541 --> 23:24.708
Yeah.
(Chuckles)

23:24.709 --> 23:26.576
Here, can you hold that
for just a second?

23:26.577 --> 23:28.344
I don't need a tampon.
I really need a phone.

23:28.345 --> 23:29.512
I'll get to the phone.

23:29.513 --> 23:31.414
I don't need a tic tac
or a tampon.

23:31.415 --> 23:33.082
Oh! (Chuckles) Doug, are
you fucking kidding me?

23:33.083 --> 23:35.018
No, no.
Give me your phone.

23:35.019 --> 23:36.586
All right, great. Photo time.
This will be great.

23:36.587 --> 23:39.122
I've been looking forward to
this all day. All right, give me a

23:39.123 --> 23:40.557
little smile. You know, pretend
that you're enjoying yourself.

23:40.558 --> 23:42.992
This is not what we talked
about. And cue artsy bullshit.

23:42.993 --> 23:45.261
Doug, no one gives a fuck.
I give an "f."

23:45.262 --> 23:46.596
Why don't we just do bunny ears
and say "cheese"?

23:46.597 --> 23:49.031
Why don't we just take this
goddamn fucking picture?

23:49.032 --> 23:50.433
Photographer:
Just smile, okay?!

23:56.274 --> 23:57.775
(Crowd gasps)

23:57.776 --> 24:00.044
Thought you could
fuck me on this deal?!

24:04.283 --> 24:06.417
I did fuck you on this deal!

24:06.418 --> 24:09.253
Who's your spy, Mike?!
Who's your fucking spy?!

24:09.254 --> 24:11.222
I fucking told him.
What?

24:11.223 --> 24:12.390
I told julianne, too.

24:12.391 --> 24:14.492
I'm taking Carlson
to kinsley with me.

24:14.493 --> 24:15.960
Monica's gonna be so
happy, so why don't you

24:15.961 --> 24:17.995
get the fuck off my client?
How about I fucking...

24:17.996 --> 24:19.230
Fucking bring it!

24:23.602 --> 24:26.003
No one move! Oh, my God!

24:26.004 --> 24:27.805
I am so gonna fuck you up!

24:27.806 --> 24:31.508
I am gonna fucking shit
all over your life!

24:31.509 --> 24:33.310
I'm gonna make you
a motherfucking asterisk

24:33.311 --> 24:35.980
on a pimple on the fucking ass
of management consulting!

24:35.981 --> 24:37.581
(Glass shatters)

24:39.117 --> 24:41.452
(Crowd gasping)

24:42.687 --> 24:45.689
(Laughs)

24:45.690 --> 24:48.526
I got the picture of the cake
