WEBVTT

00:12.560 --> 00:18.000
Tonight: A fat man gets murdered,
a donkey gets overtaken,

00:18.035 --> 00:21.480
and James wears ladies' underwear
on his head.

00:28.560 --> 00:30.980
Hello. Hello, good evening.

00:31.015 --> 00:33.487
Welcome. Welcome, everybody.

00:33.522 --> 00:36.021
Thank you. Thank you so much.

00:36.056 --> 00:38.485
Now, we begin with a letter.

00:38.520 --> 00:43.320
It says, "Dear Top Gear, I'm a
leading light in the Albanian Mafia

00:43.355 --> 00:48.120
"and I'm thinking of buying the
new baby Rolls-Royce, the Ghost.

00:48.155 --> 00:52.445
"But how does it compare to,
say, a Bentley or a Mercedes?

00:52.480 --> 00:58.960
"Yours sincerely, Normanski Ataesi. " Now
this caused one hell of a row in the office.

00:58.995 --> 01:01.885
The producers said we should go
out to Albania and do the test.

01:01.920 --> 01:06.360
We said, "No, we can't be seen to be
helping the Mafia. " We were adamant.

01:06.395 --> 01:10.360
We said, "This is our line
in the sand, we will not go!"

01:16.520 --> 01:22.120
You join me on the ferry from Corfu to
Albania and here is the car in question,

01:22.155 --> 01:25.125
the new Rolls-Royce Ghost -

01:25.160 --> 01:30.160
ã200,000 of power,
prestige and... peeled cows.

01:33.080 --> 01:35.400
And this Mercedes
is the alternative -

01:35.435 --> 01:37.845
the twin turbo-charged V12 S65.

01:37.880 --> 01:42.080
In short, the most powerful
saloon car in the world.

01:42.115 --> 01:46.245
And this is where the
Bentley Mulsanne should be,

01:46.280 --> 01:49.840
but just a few days before
we were due to come out here,

01:49.875 --> 01:53.480
Bentley decided
not to take part in the film.

01:53.515 --> 01:55.005
So no Bentley?

01:55.040 --> 01:58.100
No. So you're going to tell a
leading light of the Albanian Mafia

01:58.135 --> 02:01.160
you couldn't bring them their
car because it was a bit difficult.

02:01.195 --> 02:04.440
No, I've made an
alternative arrangement.

02:08.840 --> 02:12.920
And when we arrived the alternative
arrangement was waiting for us.

02:17.000 --> 02:18.365
It's a Yugo. Yes.

02:18.400 --> 02:25.400
But in a number of critical ways, it is exactly the
same as the new Bentley Mulsanne. Listen to this.

02:25.435 --> 02:26.685
There you go.

02:26.720 --> 02:28.765
That's the same sort of
dull aristocratic whump.

02:28.800 --> 02:31.445
Four door. There's a hole on
the outside you put the fuel in.

02:31.480 --> 02:36.160
Yeah, engine at the front, rear drive, probably.
Drive it from there. From that wheel there.

02:36.195 --> 02:40.057
It is
- for this mission, it's exactly the same as the Bentley Mulsanne,

02:40.092 --> 02:43.920
in the same way that Roy Hattersley
is the same as a tub of lard. Yes.

02:43.955 --> 02:46.800
This is the perfect car for the job.

02:46.835 --> 02:48.645
Can't say that. What?

02:48.680 --> 02:52.560
You can't say that word, the C-word.
I didn't, did I?

02:52.595 --> 02:56.685
Not that C-word, the other C-word.
Car? Yes.

02:56.720 --> 03:01.800
Car? You can't say that,
car here means gentleman's sausage.

03:01.835 --> 03:06.845
Really? What? That's why
they all watch Top Gear in Albania.

03:06.880 --> 03:11.165
Funnier even than Norman
Wisdom, you make show about...

03:11.200 --> 03:16.040
So when I say, "My car's enormous... " That's the
funniest thing in the world they've ever heard.

03:16.075 --> 03:17.245
They tune in every week.

03:17.280 --> 03:20.640
We do a car show.
Yes, but you can't say car or peach.

03:20.675 --> 03:23.045
Peach? Don't say peach?

03:23.080 --> 03:29.280
What does that mean? Lady garden.
So this car's a peach is really bad.

03:32.880 --> 03:38.560
With the ground rules established, we headed
inland into the rain to begin the road test.

03:40.760 --> 03:46.760
Let's get one thing absolutely clear from the
start - the Ghost is not a bespoke Rolls-Royce,

03:46.795 --> 03:49.677
not like the Phantom,
the bigger one.

03:49.712 --> 03:52.525
This one underneath
is a BMW 7 Series.

03:52.560 --> 03:58.000
However, everything you see, everything you
touch, everything you feel, it's all Rolls-Royce.

03:58.035 --> 04:02.640
It's chuffing marvellous,
this ca... motor.

04:05.760 --> 04:10.480
At ã160,000, the S Class
is ã40,000 less than the Ghost.

04:10.515 --> 04:12.325
But it's not like they have skimped.

04:12.360 --> 04:18.640
I've never driven anything where you get such
a sense of there being a lot of things going on

04:18.675 --> 04:22.445
in the background, to keep you safe,
to keep you on the road.

04:22.480 --> 04:25.525
Everywhere I look there's a little
light comes on to let you know -

04:25.560 --> 04:28.925
one there to tell me it's a 30 kilometre
an hour speed limit around here.

04:28.960 --> 04:35.480
It just knows that and I have never
experienced a car this big and so powerful.

04:35.515 --> 04:40.685
I can't believe
I said car this big.

04:40.720 --> 04:47.840
In the Mulsanne, however... I must say
I'm terribly disappointed by the Bentley.

04:47.875 --> 04:50.365
It is the most expensive...

04:50.400 --> 04:56.240
Oh, God, strewth! I'm going off.
No, I managed to... Jesus wept!

04:58.000 --> 05:02.005
It is the most expensive penis
of the three,

05:02.040 --> 05:07.680
ã220,000, and from where
I am sitting, it is hard to see why.

05:09.480 --> 05:15.600
Oh, crunch. What the hell
were Bentley thinking of?

05:17.360 --> 05:20.680
Even by Albanian standards,
it was absolute rubbish.

05:24.480 --> 05:30.000
Until 1991, Albania was probably the
most extreme Marxist state in the world.

05:32.360 --> 05:38.000
One man, who owned a cafe, got 18 years in jail
for telling a customer he didn't have a spoon.

05:38.035 --> 05:41.485
Another guy pointed at Corfu
over there and said,

05:41.520 --> 05:46.600
"Why have they got a light in their
harbour and we haven't?" He got 25 years.

05:48.720 --> 05:53.400
And soon we were reminded of the dark
days because the road just sort of stopped.

05:53.435 --> 05:58.880
And to make things worse, instead
of white lines, they'd used rocks.

06:01.480 --> 06:05.480
Let's not view this as a bad thing, it is
at least a chance to test the car's ride.

06:11.920 --> 06:15.325
As far as I'm concerned, the road
merely changes colour occasionally.

06:15.360 --> 06:21.440
I am quite surprised because this is an AMG-tuned
Merc, which you would expect to be a very firm thing.

06:21.475 --> 06:25.760
It's coping with this very well.
However, in the Bentley...

06:29.360 --> 06:33.920
This has to be the least
refined car I've ever driven.

06:33.955 --> 06:35.485
This is simply intolerable.

06:35.520 --> 06:40.285
ã220,000 for this. Oh, God, it's...

06:40.320 --> 06:44.285
Yeah, you got hooked
up on a cat's eye, mate.

06:44.320 --> 06:50.680
Let's - can we - if one pushes and two lift
the wheel arches... We just lift it off. Heave!

06:50.715 --> 06:53.917
The bumper is in deep trouble here.

06:53.952 --> 06:57.085
Yes. Just drive it back, hang on.

06:57.120 --> 07:00.480
That is wedged. That's sad to
see a Bentley treated in such a...

07:04.520 --> 07:06.520
Nice It's off.

07:06.555 --> 07:08.485
Tough thing!

07:08.520 --> 07:15.360
Fortunately, the rough road soon ended.
Unfortunately, it ended at an Albanian river crossing.

07:18.280 --> 07:20.085
That's not the ferry, is it? Yes.

07:20.120 --> 07:23.800
That's a raft,
rather than a ferry, isn't it?

07:26.160 --> 07:29.880
Still, it wasn't like the cars we'd
be loading were valuable, or heavy.

07:29.915 --> 07:33.520
It's not even fastened together.
It's driftwood.

07:33.555 --> 07:35.485
Have seen the captain's chair?

07:35.520 --> 07:41.000
That's the most incredible thing I've seen
- it's got five legs, it's got five legs.

07:41.035 --> 07:45.000
Despite the peril,
James volunteered to go first.

07:45.035 --> 07:48.245
Ha-ha-ha!

07:48.280 --> 07:53.520
No, no. You're all right now.

08:01.000 --> 08:07.400
Oh, my God. What worries me is the Bentley
is 2.8 tonnes, it's the heaviest by far.

08:11.000 --> 08:14.280
Wow. I guess because it's in the
middle, it didn't have the same effect.

08:14.315 --> 08:16.405
We're off.

08:16.440 --> 08:21.400
We are now leaving the shore on an old piece of
flotsam with over half a million quids worth of cars.

08:21.435 --> 08:23.245
This is the best ferry
I've ever been on.

08:23.280 --> 08:26.640
It is the worst I've ever been on. This is the worst
thing I've ever been on. It's absolutely terrible.

08:26.675 --> 08:30.880
Eventually, HMS Driftwood deposited
us gracefully on the other side.

08:36.159 --> 08:39.684
Oh, no. And as we drove
on, we realised that one

08:39.720 --> 08:45.520
benefit of the Mercedes, if you're a
Mafia boss, is that you do blend in.

08:45.555 --> 08:47.040
Mercedes. Mercedes. Mercedes.

08:47.075 --> 08:49.165
Mercedes. Mercedes.

08:49.200 --> 08:52.880
Mercedes. Mercedes. Mercedes.

08:52.915 --> 08:54.160
Look at them all.

08:55.720 --> 08:59.925
Mercedes. Mercedes. Mercedes.

08:59.960 --> 09:06.800
It turns out that a staggering 80% of all
cars registered in Albania are old Mercs.

09:06.835 --> 09:09.485
But that said,
English cars are popular too -

09:09.520 --> 09:14.320
a point we discussed when we
pulled over for afternoon tea.

09:14.355 --> 09:19.205
Apparently, what happens is,
Albanians go to England,

09:19.240 --> 09:24.085
get a job, buy a car, and then
bring it back with them here.

09:24.120 --> 09:28.525
Right. It is quite traditional when you
bring a car back like that that you drive it

09:28.560 --> 09:33.400
around with the door locks pulled out and sometimes
little marks along the back of the door, the trailing edge.

09:33.435 --> 09:40.045
They have a tradition here of filing off any numbers
they find under the bonnet. That's to save weight.

09:40.080 --> 09:46.360
Oh, is it? Yes, that's why they do it, all the VIN
numbers, identifying plates, that makes the car lighter.

09:46.395 --> 09:49.520
Oh I see.
Weight-saving measures are important.

09:49.555 --> 09:51.280
Some of them, though, are stolen.

09:51.315 --> 09:53.685
No! Give up!

09:53.720 --> 09:59.080
I'm afraid they are. After tea, the sun came out,
so we hit the coast road and went for a nice cruise.

10:07.400 --> 10:09.485
Well, it was nice for me.

10:09.520 --> 10:16.640
God! The power of this thing and the
acceleration it makes possible is mind-blowing.

10:16.675 --> 10:20.245
It's weird, actually,
because it's so quiet.

10:20.280 --> 10:25.800
There's always noise when you go fast
and yet, in this, there really isn't.

10:25.835 --> 10:32.240
The beans, oh! It doesn't encourage
you to be sporty, or aggressive.

10:32.275 --> 10:36.925
It's just so nice.

10:36.960 --> 10:39.725
It's nice in the Rolls-Royce.

10:39.760 --> 10:43.880
But then my nice time was
ruined by news from the Bentley.

10:43.915 --> 10:47.405
Oh, no, the Mulsanne is overheating.

10:47.440 --> 10:54.400
We stopped to let the twin turbo V8
cool, but then... it decided to die.

10:55.440 --> 10:59.020
No.
So I tried a reverse bump start.

10:59.055 --> 11:02.600
He's done that wrong. The brakes!

11:02.635 --> 11:03.760
No.

11:08.000 --> 11:09.565
The door mirror's come off!

11:09.600 --> 11:13.600
It's suddenly dawned upon me
that he isn't very bright.

11:15.680 --> 11:18.560
I think he could be a massive idiot.

11:20.520 --> 11:21.565
The door mirror!

11:21.600 --> 11:24.120
How long will he go before...?
Well...

11:25.840 --> 11:27.405
Oh, no.

11:27.440 --> 11:30.365
Just get it away from the wall.

11:30.400 --> 11:33.645
It's the steepest hill in
Albania you've broken down on.

11:33.680 --> 11:38.560
While we examined the engine, the
orang-utan tried to mend the door.

11:44.160 --> 11:47.720
Then an Albanian mechanic
arrived and Jeremy filled him in.

11:47.755 --> 11:50.885
Running, then stop.

11:50.920 --> 11:52.800
That describes most breakdowns.

11:52.835 --> 11:54.645
Running and then stop, you idiot!

11:54.680 --> 11:57.920
Don't say to that man,
"My car needs a jump. "

12:00.400 --> 12:01.880
Yes. Yes.

12:04.360 --> 12:06.405
The Bentley is running well.

12:06.440 --> 12:11.600
It had been a long and tiring day on
the road, but for Hammond, that was OK.

12:11.635 --> 12:15.925
This S Class has a
new system on board.

12:15.960 --> 12:19.285
It just monitors the driver to make
sure he or she isn't getting sleepy,

12:19.320 --> 12:25.420
or wandering out of the lane, or nodding off, and
it's monitoring 70 different parameters about me.

12:25.455 --> 12:32.247
That must include whether or not I like different
types of cheese, or if I'm thinking about hats.

12:32.282 --> 12:39.040
I was on life-support in an intensive care unit
and they weren't monitoring 70 things about me.

12:42.920 --> 12:46.040
Soon, we arrived at a
disused submarine base.

12:53.040 --> 12:56.720
And Jeremy insisted we should stop.

12:56.755 --> 12:59.597
I am a mountain goat. Oh!

12:59.632 --> 13:02.405
That was close.

13:02.440 --> 13:05.805
Yes.
I love the idea of sneaky warfare.

13:05.840 --> 13:11.480
If there were to be a war tomorrow, and I had
to volunteer for some service, definitely subs.

13:11.515 --> 13:14.880
Which is ironic - can you imagine a
place where you'd be less welcome.

13:14.915 --> 13:16.725
I wonder if they're for sale.

13:16.760 --> 13:20.440
What are you going to do
with a submarine, Jeremy?

13:20.475 --> 13:23.000
Well, drive about in it.

13:25.720 --> 13:29.240
With the sun going down,
I was dragged away from the sub pen

13:29.275 --> 13:31.805
so we could get back
to our Mafia road test.

13:31.840 --> 13:38.405
We've had a discussion, and we reckon
that when someone from the Albanian Mafia

13:38.440 --> 13:45.800
is choosing a new car, uppermost in his mind
will be this: "Can I get a dead body in the boot?"

13:45.835 --> 13:48.045
Makes sense.
That is why the car has a boot.

13:48.080 --> 13:54.760
Stands to reason. Unfortunately, to find out which
of the cars is best, we've had to murder a passer-by.

13:54.795 --> 13:56.805
Yeah. And here he is.

13:56.840 --> 14:01.280
As you can see, he's quite a big
chap, so he took a lot of murdering.

14:01.315 --> 14:02.965
And now James is going to see

14:03.000 --> 14:05.920
if he can get him in the boot
of the Rolls-Royce.

14:05.955 --> 14:09.400
Am I? Yes. You go first, yes. OK.

14:12.200 --> 14:14.600
That's a good start. Look at that.

14:14.635 --> 14:16.965
What? He was a member of a gym.

14:17.000 --> 14:20.525
He was not! Could we have murdered
someone a bit smaller? Not really.

14:20.560 --> 14:24.720
He was the only one we could catch.
Anyone smaller would have been faster.

14:24.755 --> 14:27.440
Come on, James, the police
could be on their way.

14:27.475 --> 14:30.360
I can't lift him up.
Three, two, one and up.

14:30.395 --> 14:32.925
No, it's not working.

14:32.960 --> 14:40.520
OK. This was hopeless. So rather embarrassingly,
we had to ask the man we murdered to give us a hand.

14:40.555 --> 14:44.205
It's not so much the
head, but everything else.

14:44.240 --> 14:49.040
All we have to do now is
saw his leg. Wait a minute.

14:49.075 --> 14:51.165
Just get that in there.

14:51.200 --> 14:52.760
Bend that back round there. Yes!

14:52.795 --> 14:54.885
Yes! Yes. Excellent.

14:54.920 --> 14:59.245
The great thing about the Rolls-Royce
is, it has self-levelling rear suspension,

14:59.280 --> 15:04.880
so when the boot is shut you won't know from the
way it's riding that there is a body in there.

15:04.915 --> 15:06.685
Except the boot won't go down.

15:06.720 --> 15:10.280
Right, you get him out and put
him in the back of the Benz.

15:10.315 --> 15:12.645
Get him out?

15:12.680 --> 15:15.365
'Sadly, there's a fridge in
the boot of the Merc,

15:15.400 --> 15:20.520
'which takes up a lot of room. '
Is that it? Can you move that knee?

15:20.555 --> 15:23.205
No chance!

15:23.240 --> 15:25.680
That meant our dead body
wouldn't fit.

15:26.400 --> 15:28.485
Nobody wants to see that.

15:28.520 --> 15:34.360
And even though he did fit in the
Bentley, there was still a problem.

15:34.395 --> 15:37.597
Mate, you can see him. Look.

15:37.632 --> 15:40.765
That is a drawback. Clearly.

15:40.800 --> 15:43.600
You might as well just put him
in the passenger seat.

15:48.200 --> 15:52.285
James, Richard, bad news.

15:52.320 --> 15:56.240
What? Do you see the girl
with the red beret on? Yeah.

15:56.275 --> 15:58.765
She's from Albania. Hello!

15:58.800 --> 16:04.160
And can we just ask, is it right
that the word "car" means...

16:04.195 --> 16:06.217
Yes.

16:08.061 --> 16:09.750
And "peach"?

16:09.785 --> 16:11.405
Yes.

16:11.440 --> 16:15.400
I thought you'd made it up.
No, we didn't make it up.

16:15.435 --> 16:17.885
She's actually from Albania.
Fair enough.

16:17.920 --> 16:20.965
I have got some more information
on this, er...

16:21.000 --> 16:25.920
You know in the film I said that
some of the cars might be stolen?

16:25.955 --> 16:28.837
I know, you did, that was shocking!
Yes, it was.

16:28.872 --> 16:31.685
Anyway, I've got some information
here on it.

16:31.720 --> 16:37.600
Albania's public order minister was on his way to
Greece to sign an agreement with his opposite number

16:37.635 --> 16:43.480
on cross-border crime, and as a formality the Greek
police did a check on his car and it was nicked.

16:43.515 --> 16:47.525
And just so I balance this out,

16:47.560 --> 16:52.760
neighbouring Macedonia, the interior
minister was very embarrassed

16:52.795 --> 16:57.960
when police noticed her car was
actually registered to David Beckham.

16:57.995 --> 16:59.845
That happens to footballers a lot.

16:59.880 --> 17:05.400
Two AC Milan players had their Range Rovers
nicked. D'you know where they turned up?

17:05.435 --> 17:08.605
Bournemouth? No, it was Albania.
Was it really?

17:08.640 --> 17:12.484
It was. I have to say - and not
just because you're here -

17:12.520 --> 17:17.400
genuinely, Albania is a fascinating,
brilliant country, very pretty too.

17:17.435 --> 17:22.280
Beautiful. Anyway, it's now time
to do the news. We begin with this.

17:22.315 --> 17:24.685
Honda, which is a Japanese
car company,

17:24.720 --> 17:31.125
they've developed a hat that knows
what your hair is thinking

17:31.160 --> 17:36.400
and then translates those thoughts in
such a way that it can drive the car.

17:36.435 --> 17:41.480
Have you gone completely mad? No,
seriously, I absolutely haven't.

17:41.515 --> 17:46.045
They say that hair transmits
neurological information. Yeah.

17:46.080 --> 17:50.480
The hat picks that up, translates it, so if
you think, "I'd like to turn the wipers on,"

17:50.515 --> 17:52.560
your hat knows that
and the wipers go on.

17:52.595 --> 17:55.040
Cos your hair tells you. Your hair?

17:57.040 --> 17:58.805
Your hair cannot drive a car.

17:58.840 --> 18:02.480
Your hair isn't very good at
being hair! In fairness, really.

18:02.515 --> 18:06.200
What if you'd had a hair transplant?

18:06.235 --> 18:07.205
Gordon Ramsay!

18:07.240 --> 18:11.725
Yeah, exactly. Gordon Ramsay, no,
wait, wait, wait! Think about it,

18:11.760 --> 18:18.320
if he's stopped for speeding, he can go, "It wasn't
me, I bought my hair from a man in Los Angeles. "

18:18.355 --> 18:21.285
Are we heading for a future where
a policeman stops you and says,

18:21.320 --> 18:24.685
"Do you know how fast your hair was
going, sir?" It's out of my hands.

18:24.720 --> 18:29.800
Does it have to be your hair... on your
head... Enough! If I buy some pants?

18:29.835 --> 18:31.360
What, Honda pants?

18:32.200 --> 18:35.880
But imagine, 17-year-olds think down
there a lot, don't they?

18:35.915 --> 18:38.965
Imagine a 17-year-old boy
driving with his pubes.

18:39.000 --> 18:42.720
A million miles an hour!
It'd be terrifying. Listen...

18:42.755 --> 18:44.925
Ferrari - let's get it back to cars.

18:44.960 --> 18:49.840
Ferrari has made a new car. It's
their first-ever 4-wheel drive car,

18:49.875 --> 18:51.525
their first-ever hatchback.

18:51.560 --> 18:54.365
There's a picture here,
it's called the FF.

18:54.400 --> 18:58.925
It's got a V12 direct-injection
engine, 6.2 litre,

18:58.960 --> 19:04.120
208 miles an hour, it's going to
cost ã250,000, which is a lot,

19:04.155 --> 19:06.920
but I think that's fantastic.
It's a return to what I call

19:06.955 --> 19:09.925
the shooting brake,
the two-plus-two estate.

19:09.960 --> 19:14.460
We haven't seen one of those
since the Lancia HPE.

19:14.495 --> 19:18.925
Ooh, yes. And do you remember
the Volvo P1800ES?

19:18.960 --> 19:22.445
That wasn't very brilliant, though.
No, it was terrible, but it looked good.

19:22.480 --> 19:27.900
It looked brilliant. And the Reliant Scimitar, which
you can see... Ah-hum! You've forgotten the rules!

19:27.935 --> 19:33.320
The law of the land states, if you say "Reliant
Scimitar" you have to have a comma and then say...

19:33.355 --> 19:36.125
Princess Anne has one of those,
you know?

19:36.160 --> 19:39.285
But you say it in such a way that
you assume no-one else knows.

19:39.320 --> 19:43.725
It's extraordinary, I can't think of another
person who is so associated with a car.

19:43.760 --> 19:48.960
Nobody ever says, "Henry Kissinger had an Escort
RS2000." He didn't, though, did he, let's be honest.

19:48.995 --> 19:51.920
She is commonly thought of as being
the hardest working Royal.

19:51.955 --> 19:53.957
She does a lot of work
for a lot of people,

19:53.992 --> 19:55.925
raises millions of pounds
all over the world.

19:55.960 --> 20:00.160
Yet she's still just known for having
a Reliant Scimitar. It must be annoying.

20:00.195 --> 20:04.205
If you think about it - her daughter
is getting married later this year.

20:04.240 --> 20:08.460
You just know the commentary. They'll wheel
out a Dimbleby and the commentary will be,

20:08.495 --> 20:12.680
"There's the bride's mother looking radiant
- she has a Reliant Scimitar, you know. "

20:12.715 --> 20:17.405
It will. I've never driven
a Reliant Scimitar, you know?

20:17.440 --> 20:21.765
I know someone who's got one. Do
you? Yeah, Princess Anne. Oh, right.

20:21.800 --> 20:25.840
You know the Fiat 500. We love it. There's a new one
- the Fiat 500 Twin Air.

20:25.875 --> 20:29.925
It's got a tiny 875cc
2- cylinder engine in there

20:29.960 --> 20:35.440
and it produces so little CO2 that it's free
to go in the congestion charging zone in London.

20:35.475 --> 20:38.097
Great little thing. When I heard
it had a 2-cylinder engine,

20:38.132 --> 20:40.685
I thought that won't move,
but it goes like the clappers.

20:40.720 --> 20:44.840
It sounds like a billion hornets
stuck in someone's bicycle spokes.

20:44.875 --> 20:48.205
Brrrrrr! It's just fantastic!

20:48.240 --> 20:52.680
There is one problem with this
fuel-saving car, though. What?

20:52.715 --> 20:55.805
It uses quite a lot of fuel.
Yes, it does.

20:55.840 --> 20:58.845
Can't argue with that.
We did a test last week.

20:58.880 --> 21:02.920
We left the track here, went back to
London - so a bit of country road,

21:02.955 --> 21:06.925
bit of dual carriageway, bit of
city driving, and it averaged 38mpg.

21:06.960 --> 21:12.260
We did the same route in a Volkswagen
Polo Bluemotion and that did 50mpg.

21:12.295 --> 21:17.560
So we have a Top Gear top tip. If
you want to buy a car to save fuel,

21:17.595 --> 21:19.925
buy this one and don't save any.

21:19.960 --> 21:25.160
You won't save anything, but you will have an
enormous amount of fun not saving any money.

21:25.195 --> 21:27.165
That's what it's for.
That's fine by me.

21:27.200 --> 21:30.485
You know Breakfast News
on television? No, not really.

21:30.520 --> 21:37.120
You must. Earlier this week they ran a story about
cyclists wearing video cameras on their crash helmets. Yeah.

21:37.155 --> 21:41.600
So they can video examples of road
rage and people cutting them up.

21:41.635 --> 21:43.205
But cyclists deserve it.

21:43.240 --> 21:46.680
Don't say that. But they do.
Just the other week... Honestly,

21:46.715 --> 21:48.725
I'm sitting in a traffic jam,
in London,

21:48.760 --> 21:52.445
and a Frenchman tried to cycle
between the pavement and my car

21:52.480 --> 21:56.005
and after he'd removed most of the
paint with the brake handle thing,

21:56.040 --> 22:00.920
he came round to the driver's door to tell me
off in that silly accent French people have.

22:00.955 --> 22:03.085
A French accent. Yes, that.

22:03.120 --> 22:07.880
I said to him, "If you just work harder,
you could have a car. " Oh, you see...!

22:07.915 --> 22:11.777
YOU are exactly the reason why I want
a camera on my helmet when I cycle.

22:11.812 --> 22:15.640
Why? So when idiots like you get
out of their car, having cut me up...

22:15.675 --> 22:18.605
Who pays the road tax? Well...
I'm sorry.

22:18.640 --> 22:23.880
I don't mind if cyclists want to come on the
road with their silly Victorian distractions.

22:23.915 --> 22:25.965
But they must behave themselves.

22:26.000 --> 22:28.885
There are a few militant cyclists...
You're one of them.

22:28.920 --> 22:33.120
I'm not a militant cyclist. You are.
On a bicycle, you are a peach.

22:34.760 --> 22:39.205
Actually, you're a peach most of
the time, but you're a big peach.

22:39.240 --> 22:45.160
You're just another fat car in his Mercedes and
has a pop at me for riding my bike to work...

22:45.195 --> 22:49.277
You always do, don't you? Often.
Yesterday I saw you riding to work,

22:49.312 --> 22:53.360
and I thought, that bicycle looks
exactly like a 1967 Ford Mustang.

22:53.395 --> 22:55.997
Yeah, well... always ride it, no.

22:56.032 --> 22:58.565
Right, that is the end of the news.

22:58.600 --> 23:04.040
Now, what we have here is a Ford Sierra
Cosworth and a Ford Escort Cosworth.

23:04.075 --> 23:09.440
I like these cars very much,
which is why I am delighted to say

23:09.475 --> 23:13.840
that after a 15-year gap,
the Cosworth name is back.

23:13.875 --> 23:17.680
But not where
you might be expecting it.

23:25.120 --> 23:27.960
Here it is, on the back of a Subaru.

23:30.800 --> 23:33.360
And in theory, that's a marriage

23:33.395 --> 23:35.405
made in heaven.

23:35.440 --> 23:40.200
You see, what Cosworth is really good at
is taking ordinary, boring family saloons

23:40.235 --> 23:43.765
and turning them
into street-fighting,

23:43.800 --> 23:46.965
come-on-if-you-think-you're
hard-enough road racers

23:47.000 --> 23:51.920
with fiery nostrils and a Geordie
Saturday night attitude to peace and love.

23:56.680 --> 24:00.720
But what they've done here is
take a dreary Impreza SDI

24:00.755 --> 24:03.880
and throw most of it away.

24:06.720 --> 24:11.920
The 2.5 litre flat-four engine is
fitted with new pistons, bearings,

24:11.955 --> 24:14.405
conrods, gaskets and head nuts,

24:14.440 --> 24:17.840
along with a totally reworked
oil pump, turbo charger,

24:17.875 --> 24:20.925
intercooler, intake system
and exhaust.

24:20.960 --> 24:24.920
There have been similar modifications elsewhere
- new wheels, tyres,

24:24.955 --> 24:29.017
springs, dampers, bushings
and brakes.

24:29.052 --> 24:33.080
It's not really a Subaru any more,
is it?

24:36.280 --> 24:38.560
So, is it any good?

24:38.595 --> 24:40.805
In a word, quite.

24:40.840 --> 24:47.160
Certainly, it does capture some of the magic
we used to get from old Subaru Imprezas.

24:50.600 --> 24:52.080
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

24:56.800 --> 24:58.925
Even when you think all is lost -

24:58.960 --> 25:04.040
sliding - oh, no, you just give it
a dab of power, like that,

25:04.075 --> 25:08.800
and even in rain like this,
it isn't lost any more.

25:10.000 --> 25:16.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

25:19.280 --> 25:21.085
Other nice things?

25:21.120 --> 25:25.640
Well, it rides beautifully for
such a limpet mine, and it is quick.

25:26.960 --> 25:30.000
0-60 takes 3.5 seconds.

25:31.960 --> 25:35.560
But there's a huge amount
of turbo lag.

25:35.595 --> 25:39.160
I'm now in fifth gear, 60mph,
foot down...

25:40.440 --> 25:41.560
.. nothing.

25:44.120 --> 25:45.725
Still nothing.

25:45.760 --> 25:48.805
Hang on a minute, hang on...

25:48.840 --> 25:51.920
No, I was mistaken, sorry,
still nothing.

25:53.360 --> 25:55.405
There is another issue, too.

25:55.440 --> 25:59.920
Cosworths are supposed to be rough-and-ready
cars for people who work with ladders.

25:59.955 --> 26:02.525
They're supposed to be
a cheap-and-cheerful way

26:02.560 --> 26:06.400
of embarrassing the Ruperts
and the Joneses in their Ferraris,

26:06.435 --> 26:11.125
but this is as near as makes
no difference ã50,000,

26:11.160 --> 26:16.000
and with all that turbo lag, all you're
going to embarrass really is... yourself.

26:17.160 --> 26:20.520
Still nothing.

26:21.840 --> 26:26.200
So, if the Subaru's no good,
what else is there?

26:31.000 --> 26:33.440
Well, there's this.

26:34.600 --> 26:39.600
It's the Ford Focus RS500,
and let's not mess about...

26:39.635 --> 26:42.640
it's brilliant.

26:46.880 --> 26:48.320
Ha-ha!

26:51.960 --> 26:58.220
It has a 2.5 litre turbo-charged
engine, just like the Subaru,

26:58.255 --> 27:04.480
not quite as powerful, but you still
get 345 brake horsepower...

27:07.480 --> 27:10.160
.. all of which is sent
to the front wheels.

27:14.680 --> 27:17.480
That sounds like the recipe
for a massive accident.

27:17.515 --> 27:19.917
But it isn't.

27:19.952 --> 27:22.320
This is really very, very good.

27:23.320 --> 27:27.645
Of course, you do get a fair bit
of torque steer.

27:27.680 --> 27:31.200
Watch the steering wheel when I put
my foot down. Hands off, here we go,

27:31.235 --> 27:34.165
and... yeah, we've turned right.

27:34.200 --> 27:38.205
And right again. Every time
the turbo cuts in, you turn right.

27:38.240 --> 27:43.920
But, thanks to a clever front
differential, the grip is incredible.

27:51.880 --> 27:55.680
It's also extremely fast.

27:56.560 --> 28:01.600
The top speed, they say, is 165mph.

28:03.520 --> 28:07.560
165- that means this Ford Focus

28:07.595 --> 28:11.600
is 10mph faster than a BMW M5.

28:12.760 --> 28:14.800
Since that is now 150...

28:15.600 --> 28:16.965
155...

28:17.000 --> 28:19.440
yeah, I'll believe them.

28:22.760 --> 28:26.040
This is a really well-sorted car.

28:27.160 --> 28:31.920
Well-equipped too, with voice
activated keyless Bluetooth.

28:31.955 --> 28:35.577
And to top it off, it's ã35,000,

28:35.612 --> 28:38.926
nearly ã15,000 less than the Subaru.

28:38.961 --> 28:42.205
So if you're after
a family hatchback

28:42.240 --> 28:47.680
that's vaguely yobbish and very
fast, this is your obvious choice.

28:47.715 --> 28:49.320
Or is it?

29:05.720 --> 29:07.800
This is a Volvo.

29:08.960 --> 29:11.320
But, before you leap
to conclusions...

29:13.000 --> 29:14.360
.. watch this.

29:17.920 --> 29:19.520
I'm in the Volvo!

29:24.320 --> 29:27.800
Go! It's a good start.

29:29.680 --> 29:31.880
And look at this!

29:33.680 --> 29:36.720
The Hush Puppy is beating
the Reeboks.

29:38.120 --> 29:41.880
Oh, yes! Ha-ha! Ha-ha-ha!

29:42.880 --> 29:44.320
Yes!

29:45.400 --> 29:47.920
The pensioner is victorious.

29:55.080 --> 30:01.760
So, what is it, then, this deafening,
electric-blue streak from the frozen North?

30:05.160 --> 30:10.405
Well, it uses exactly the same
turbo-charged 2.5 litre engine

30:10.440 --> 30:15.640
that Ford use in the hot Focus, but
in this it's all turned up to 27...

30:15.675 --> 30:18.977
or 86 or 109 because it produces,

30:19.012 --> 30:22.280
as near as makes no difference,

30:22.315 --> 30:24.400
400 horsepower.

30:28.680 --> 30:30.725
Small wonder they called it the PCP

30:30.760 --> 30:35.040
cos it really is like driving around
in a cloud of angel dust.

30:35.680 --> 30:36.960
Brrrrrrrr!

30:44.995 --> 30:46.597
Listen to that!

30:49.040 --> 30:52.640
Of course, you probably think
it will all fall to pieces

30:52.675 --> 30:55.280
when it sees a corner. But, no.

31:00.640 --> 31:05.180
It has, I'm delighted to say on
a day like today, four-wheel-drive,

31:05.215 --> 31:09.720
so the grip is just phenomenal
and you can reach amazing angles

31:09.755 --> 31:10.840
and still rescue it.

31:13.880 --> 31:17.640
It was built for fun by the team
that makes the Volvos

31:17.675 --> 31:21.520
for the Swedish
Touring Car Championship

31:21.555 --> 31:23.205
and it is genuinely remarkable.

31:23.240 --> 31:27.300
Really sharp, really hard,
really raw,

31:27.335 --> 31:31.360
and it just goes like the clappers.

31:36.600 --> 31:41.600
To top it all off, the PCP
is based on a normal Volvo C30,

31:41.635 --> 31:44.000
which we on Top Gear
think is the best-looking

31:44.035 --> 31:46.925
of all the small hatchbacks.

31:46.960 --> 31:50.565
Inside, the steering wheel,
the gear lever, the doors,

31:50.600 --> 31:54.920
the seats, everything, is covered
in what appears to be mole skin.

31:54.955 --> 31:59.040
And that does make you wonder
how big was the mole

31:59.075 --> 32:01.480
they peeled to make this piece?

32:07.120 --> 32:12.720
This car is epic, but there is
one quite large problem with it.

32:12.755 --> 32:16.440
Volvo refuses point blank
to put it into production.

32:19.080 --> 32:20.200
Pity.

32:24.880 --> 32:30.040
Wow. It's a shame. That Volvo does
just sound incredible. Amazing.

32:30.075 --> 32:34.777
But because they're not actually
making it, you would have the Focus?

32:34.812 --> 32:39.480
The problem is, they only made
500 of these and they're sold out.

32:39.515 --> 32:42.440
Right. So if you want a very
hot hatch, it's got to be

32:42.475 --> 32:44.365
the not so good Subaru?

32:44.400 --> 32:48.720
They only made 75 of those
and they are sold out, as well.

32:48.755 --> 32:53.005
Hang on, you have just spent
nine minutes of our lives

32:53.040 --> 32:56.360
reviewing two cars you can't buy
and one that doesn't exist?

32:56.395 --> 32:57.765
Yes, I have. Thank you.

32:57.800 --> 33:02.200
Yes, I have. Now, we must find out
how fast they go round our track.

33:02.235 --> 33:06.040
Not the Volvo, because this board
is for production cars only,

33:06.075 --> 33:07.765
so, the other two.

33:07.800 --> 33:11.000
That, of course, means handing them
to our tame racing driver.

33:11.035 --> 33:17.005
Some say he once tore a goat in half

33:17.040 --> 33:20.920
and that he's now regretting
buying his new holiday home

33:20.955 --> 33:23.000
in downtown Cairo.

33:24.040 --> 33:26.645
All we know is,
he's called the Stig.

33:26.680 --> 33:30.600
And they're off. The track is damp
and that should mean

33:30.635 --> 33:33.680
the four-wheel-drive Subaru
has the advantage over

33:33.715 --> 33:35.337
the front-wheel-drive Ford.

33:35.372 --> 33:36.925
Let's see in the first corner.

33:36.960 --> 33:40.560
Coming in wide and...
let's have a look.

33:40.595 --> 33:44.160
Oh, it's the Imprezza,
getting out of shape.

33:48.240 --> 33:52.340
Absolutely no idea
why he is listening to that.

33:52.375 --> 33:55.827
Now, the Ford coming out there,
looking OK, good.

33:55.862 --> 33:58.991
That trick dif pulling it straight
in the Hammerhead.

33:59.026 --> 34:02.120
Let's watch out for understeer
from either of them...

34:03.080 --> 34:04.365
No, all pretty tidy.

34:04.400 --> 34:08.360
So, here we are, two turbo-charged
slingshots on to the straight.

34:13.800 --> 34:16.085
Into Follow-through...

34:16.120 --> 34:19.760
Ooh, Stig drifting
the Subaru like a mad one!

34:20.719 --> 34:23.219
Imprezzas normally
look like a gum disease.

34:23.255 --> 34:25.685
This one is a gum disease
with a spoiler on it.

34:25.719 --> 34:29.719
And with those blacked windows,
the Ford looks like a van.

34:29.755 --> 34:31.284
Just Gambon left.

34:31.320 --> 34:34.280
Two hatchback drabs
coming through there.

34:35.639 --> 34:36.840
And across the line!

34:39.440 --> 34:43.980
I have the times here.
And the Focus did it

34:44.014 --> 34:48.485
in 1.30.8.
So, wet track, in between two 911s.

34:48.520 --> 34:51.960
The Subaru, though, I think, thanks
to four-wheel-drive, did it in

34:51.995 --> 34:57.485
1.27.7, so that goes there, look.

34:57.520 --> 35:00.960
That's some useful consumer advice,
if you are thinking of buying

35:00.995 --> 35:04.077
any of them, which you aren't,
because you can't. Thanks

35:04.112 --> 35:07.160
Let's move on now.
It's time, in fact, to put a star

35:07.195 --> 35:09.045
in our reasonably-priced car.

35:09.080 --> 35:11.805
My guest tonight
is a prodigious tweeter.

35:11.840 --> 35:14.800
He tweeted only this morning
to say he was going to appear

35:14.835 --> 35:17.120
on the show dressed as a Mexican.

35:18.240 --> 35:20.760
Ladies and gentlemen,
please welcome, Jonathan Ross!

35:24.760 --> 35:27.680
Thank you. Thank you.
Hello. Hello, Jeremy.

35:27.715 --> 35:30.600
Very well. How are you? I'm good.
Have a seat.

35:31.640 --> 35:32.645
What?

35:32.680 --> 35:35.760
I brought my Mexican
wrestling mask along,

35:35.795 --> 35:38.680
so you can apologise in person.

35:38.715 --> 35:40.445
Put it away.

35:40.480 --> 35:43.605
There's just no possibility of us
mentioning Mexico this week.

35:43.640 --> 35:48.400
We mentioned it maybe twice, I think we have
got away with it. You are back on the BBC?

35:48.435 --> 35:51.880
I'm back, who thought that would
happen? Not me. I had 20 quid on it.

35:53.800 --> 35:55.420
Are you a bit nervous?

35:55.455 --> 35:56.787
No. Why, should I be?

35:56.822 --> 35:58.085
No, back on the Beeb.

35:58.120 --> 36:00.280
I thought you were going
to come out to me.

36:01.200 --> 36:03.600
At least you have chosen
to come back on a show

36:03.635 --> 36:05.797
that never gets into trouble.
Exactly.

36:05.832 --> 36:07.925
And I'm a safe booking for you.
Exactly.

36:07.960 --> 36:13.360
Listen... do you have Tourette's
or do you know what you're doing?

36:13.395 --> 36:15.200
BLEEP BLEEP, you BLEEP!

36:16.400 --> 36:20.360
Oh no, I don't. Did that come out?

36:20.395 --> 36:22.257
Yeah, you said it out loud.

36:22.292 --> 36:24.085
For me, that was just in there.

36:24.120 --> 36:27.800
No, I don't have Tourette's,
Mr Clarkson, but I do sometimes

36:27.835 --> 36:30.937
maybe go a little bit further
than other people.

36:30.972 --> 36:34.005
I always thought that was
part of what I should do.

36:34.040 --> 36:37.840
You are paid to do certain things and feel you
should push things in a certain way and put it out.

36:37.875 --> 36:41.897
You had David Cameron on the show
and asked him if - what's the word

36:41.932 --> 36:45.920
I can use? - pleasured himself
while thinking about Mrs Thatcher?

36:45.955 --> 36:47.765
Yes. You did say that?

36:47.800 --> 36:49.845
And then there was Gwyneth Paltrow.

36:49.880 --> 36:53.640
You said you would like
to make a bouncy-bouncy!

36:53.675 --> 36:57.400
Look, when you were driven round
by Cameron Diaz,

36:57.435 --> 36:59.520
what were you thinking? Oh.

36:59.555 --> 37:00.857
Yes.

37:02.160 --> 37:06.100
We know what you were thinking. Many bad
things. You didn't say it out loud, but I was...

37:06.135 --> 37:10.040
The show I had on the BBC, certainly part of
the fun of it and part of what we were doing

37:10.075 --> 37:13.005
was doing something very much
of the moment and that was the joke.

37:13.040 --> 37:16.285
I would stand by that, even though
that was one of the complaints upheld,

37:16.320 --> 37:21.680
not made by Cameron, by the way. who I would
still love to... Cameron? David Cameron?

37:21.715 --> 37:23.605
Cameron Diaz. Oh, Cameron Diaz!

37:23.640 --> 37:27.320
I thought you were coming out to David Cameron
- a terrifying prospect.

37:27.355 --> 37:31.000
I'd rather come out to Nick Clegg.
He looks so much easier to dominate!

37:33.680 --> 37:37.240
We are living in strange times.
We must be careful that we don't

37:37.275 --> 37:39.160
trip up over anybody,
which means...

37:39.195 --> 37:40.720
We can't talk about anything.

37:40.755 --> 37:42.325
Well, your beard...

37:42.360 --> 37:45.565
Lovely. We might upset
beards and beardmen.

37:45.600 --> 37:49.000
Why have you grown a beard?
Why have I grown a beard? Mmm.

37:49.035 --> 37:51.645
It's easier than getting up
and shaving, for a start,

37:51.680 --> 37:55.120
because you only do this - zzz, zzz,
zzz. I did take a really big chunk

37:55.155 --> 37:56.605
out the bottom the other day,

37:56.640 --> 37:59.005
because I've got one where you
set it and it takes a bit,

37:59.040 --> 38:02.560
but I had it on the wrong one, my wife was
talking, I went, "Yes, darling. " and I had

38:02.595 --> 38:04.360
a reverse Mohawk,
with a big stripe up there.

38:04.395 --> 38:06.445
The opposite of a Brazilian?

38:06.480 --> 38:09.805
Yes, I do use the same one down
there, to trim up the old fella,

38:09.840 --> 38:13.160
because otherwise you get to our age
and you can't see anything there.

38:13.195 --> 38:16.480
I should explain, we are - we don't
look it - but we are the same age.

38:16.515 --> 38:18.200
Man, what happened to you?!

38:20.800 --> 38:23.340
Well, I'm now... You were going
there, I had to get in first!

38:23.375 --> 38:26.527
I now walk up stairs. Do you?
Yeah. Have you never walked up?

38:26.562 --> 38:29.680
What did you used to do - crawl
on your belly like a snake?

38:29.715 --> 38:31.565
No, do you not do exercise?

38:31.600 --> 38:34.085
I do. I'm quite strong
at the moment, but a bit flabby.

38:34.120 --> 38:37.560
Can you do those things where you
lie on the floor, you basically do

38:37.595 --> 38:41.000
a press up and then just hold
it there? A plank, yes. You cannot.

38:41.035 --> 38:43.520
What's wrong with you?
You made out of jelly?

38:44.480 --> 38:48.005
Get your clock out.
Get your BLEEP out?! I'm going.

38:48.040 --> 38:51.480
At least my hearing's still working!
What's wrong with you?!

38:51.515 --> 38:54.920
Get down on the floor. I bet you
I can do one for longer. Go!

38:57.720 --> 39:01.520
I can be here for hours. I can be
here for hours. Are you in a rush?

39:01.555 --> 39:05.320
My arms are starting to wobble quite
badly now. They're not. They are.

39:11.200 --> 39:12.480
That was just bullying!

39:14.080 --> 39:18.280
Otherwise, we would have been there for
hours. I can do that, literally, all day.

39:18.315 --> 39:20.605
That is not an exercise.
It is an exercise.

39:20.640 --> 39:23.080
That is not an exercise.
All you have done is freeze

39:23.115 --> 39:25.080
your joints in place,
that's not an exercise.

39:29.200 --> 39:33.340
Give me a minute. It is hard,
isn't it? I'm sweating quite badly.

39:33.375 --> 39:37.445
You grow this. Now we have
passed 50, this has just appeared.

39:37.480 --> 39:41.800
I have no clue what you're saying. I want to talk
about cars. People buy cars for different reasons.

39:41.835 --> 39:45.600
I buy them because they're loud, James
May buys them because they're brown.

39:45.635 --> 39:48.365
Looking at yours,
you buy them because they're stupid.

39:48.400 --> 39:52.760
Well, you might think stupid, but one
man's stupid is another man's cute and fun.

39:52.795 --> 39:55.480
Pink Ford Thunderbird?
I've got the Thunderbird.

39:55.515 --> 39:56.965
It is quite stupid.

39:57.000 --> 40:00.480
No, it's pretty. I don't like driving
around seeing all cars look the same.

40:00.515 --> 40:03.717
I like Hammond, what's happened
to him recently? He's got very...

40:03.752 --> 40:06.920
In what way? He looks like -
imagine if you asked a girlie girl

40:06.955 --> 40:09.000
to decorate a scarecrow, that's him.

40:10.720 --> 40:13.800
Somebody's bought him an Adam and the
Ants video. He's wearing a necklace.

40:13.835 --> 40:15.525
♪ Stand and deliver. ♪

40:15.560 --> 40:17.600
Does he think he's on his gap-year?

40:19.120 --> 40:22.220
At least May, you know he's going
to be dull before you see him.

40:22.255 --> 40:25.320
I don't much like Jonathan
Ross, he's much too flamboyant.

40:25.355 --> 40:27.085
He didn't like me at all.

40:27.120 --> 40:29.900
Stop changing the subject.
Pink Thunderbird?

40:29.935 --> 40:32.645
It's coral pink
and I love convertibles.

40:32.680 --> 40:36.820
If it's not raining, even if it's Arctic, I
will have... in the snow, I had my roof down.

40:36.855 --> 40:40.960
Just tell me, when you are driving along then
and people can see it is you and everything...

40:42.360 --> 40:47.680
Are people appreciative or do they say other
things? They love it. "Hey, Wossy", all the time.

40:47.715 --> 40:50.405
The other ones -
a Messerschmitt and a bubble car.

40:50.440 --> 40:53.685
Is that two... The Messerschmitt
has got the seat behind each other.

40:53.720 --> 40:58.120
It's like a two-stroke engine, but it's really
weird, because if you want to go in reverse,

40:58.155 --> 41:02.160
you press the key and when you do the
ignition, the solenoid drops to the back.

41:02.195 --> 41:04.805
So you can get in fourth gear
in reverse. You can.

41:04.840 --> 41:09.320
You can go to something like 50mph in
reverse in something which is like a lunchbox.

41:10.960 --> 41:15.240
You've got kids, family and all that.
There's nothing in that list where you say,

41:15.275 --> 41:16.960
"Come on, kids, I'll take you in... "

41:17.280 --> 41:20.300
The one we use for the family
is the car we have had the longest,

41:20.335 --> 41:23.427
which is, we've got a Toyota Previa,
bought second hand 12 years ago,

41:23.462 --> 41:26.520
and we've had any number of scrapes
in it. The dogs have been sick,

41:26.555 --> 41:29.165
people have
dropped drinks everywhere.

41:29.200 --> 41:32.840
I think my wife did a wee once on
a long journey. We've all done it!

41:32.875 --> 41:36.445
I was saying to her the other day,
"You know what is a brilliant idea,

41:36.480 --> 41:41.200
"we should get together and get some business,
go and see the Dragons. " If you had a car seat,

41:41.235 --> 41:43.405
on a long journey, pull out a little
thing and it's a potty.

41:43.440 --> 41:48.320
Then when you go along, press a button, a little
panel opens up underneath the car like on a plane,

41:48.355 --> 41:50.717
drops the poo and the wee
out on the motorway.

41:50.752 --> 41:53.080
Or outside someone's house
you don't like.

41:55.520 --> 42:00.000
I think we've managed to get through the interview
part of the interview without too much of a problem.

42:00.035 --> 42:01.360
Thank Allah for that!

42:02.600 --> 42:05.420
That's fine. That's all right.
That's positive.

42:05.455 --> 42:08.205
That's all encompassing,
that is multi-cultural.

42:08.240 --> 42:10.960
If you do have a problem,
write to us, at Jonathan Ross, ITV.

42:13.920 --> 42:16.340
So we get on now,
of course, to your lap. Yes.

42:16.375 --> 42:18.760
The last time you were here,
you got lost.

42:18.795 --> 42:20.845
No, I didn't get lost.

42:20.880 --> 42:24.285
Well... you stopped at the Hammerhead
and went like this...

42:24.320 --> 42:29.160
Because I couldn't... All right, because there
was no-one there to give directions and the

42:29.195 --> 42:32.440
track had disappeared under a large,
let's call it a lake, shall we?

42:32.475 --> 42:36.485
It was a very rainy day, and I
went, apparently, over the line.

42:36.520 --> 42:41.240
Because you are clearly threatened by me, the
Alpha male, you took time off me for that reason.

42:41.275 --> 42:43.725
You've got that arthritis
in your finger.

42:43.760 --> 42:47.560
No, this is a tragic story from my youth. I
chopped the top of my finger off when I was two,

42:47.595 --> 42:50.605
because my mum had gone out to
borrow food from the neighbours -

42:50.640 --> 42:55.360
this sounds so bleak and poverty-ridden
- I apparently crawled to the bin

42:55.395 --> 42:59.117
and got a can of beans out and then
sliced my finger off on the top.

42:59.152 --> 43:02.840
And you see the stitch marks,
if you look closely. Look at that.

43:02.875 --> 43:05.160
I did mine skiing in St Moritz!

43:08.680 --> 43:11.280
Anyway, who would like
to see Jonathan's lap?

43:11.315 --> 43:12.285
Yes!

43:12.320 --> 43:14.000
Let's have a look.

43:15.760 --> 43:17.960
Right. Ooh, I say we're determined.

43:17.995 --> 43:19.885
Is that a good start? Ish.

43:19.920 --> 43:22.960
I think Clarkson arranges
bad weather for me.

43:24.160 --> 43:28.920
Here we go into the first corner,
still going round it...

43:28.955 --> 43:31.045
Is that good, I can't tell?

43:31.080 --> 43:33.205
Well, not very fast,
but sometimes...

43:33.240 --> 43:36.445
♪ I'm turning in nice
and I'm braking now, baby. ♪

43:36.480 --> 43:42.280
.. sometimes when a car looks slow,
it is actually quite fast.

43:42.315 --> 43:44.120
Boom. Third. Up.

43:45.560 --> 43:47.960
Here we go.
You have slowed that footage down.

43:47.995 --> 43:49.885
This is very slow through here.

43:49.920 --> 43:52.885
That's a good corner,
that's good cornering.

43:52.920 --> 43:56.360
That's where you got lost last time.
You've done well - got out of it.

43:56.395 --> 43:59.960
I was trying to go to third
and I went into fifth. Showboating.

43:59.995 --> 44:01.125
I was in BLEEP fourth.

44:01.160 --> 44:03.245
I put it in the wrong gear.

44:03.280 --> 44:06.040
Fourth sounds about right,
fifth, there. Pretty good.

44:06.075 --> 44:08.960
This is better.
And missed the BLEEP tyres.

44:10.040 --> 44:11.525
Whoa!

44:11.560 --> 44:14.560
The reason you look so slow
is because you are quite slow.

44:16.400 --> 44:17.885
Where are you going now?!

44:17.920 --> 44:20.165
He told me to do that.
Stig told me to do that.

44:20.200 --> 44:24.320
He wouldn't tell you to go off
on the grass. You are lost again.

44:24.355 --> 44:27.280
I didn't want to miss the
opportunity to see the greenery.

44:27.840 --> 44:31.605
There we go, across the line.
Was that my best one?

44:31.640 --> 44:35.960
It's a combination of various shots
to illustrate your driving style.

44:35.995 --> 44:39.400
It's harder than it looks.
It is harder than it looks.

44:39.435 --> 44:41.200
It isn't easy.
What did I do last time?

44:41.235 --> 44:43.285
I bet I've beaten my last time.

44:43.320 --> 44:48.245
I was low last time. You were
really low last time. Let's do it.

44:48.280 --> 44:53.520
Last time you were here, you did it in one minute
57 seconds, which would have put you about here.

44:53.555 --> 44:58.240
That was a lot slower, that car.
This is a faster car. Yeah.

44:58.275 --> 45:00.680
1.57. This time you did it...

45:01.840 --> 45:02.920
.. one minute...

45:03.880 --> 45:09.565
.. 49 dead. Yes!

45:09.600 --> 45:12.200
That is a big improvement.
I'm up there with Jeff Goldblum.

45:14.960 --> 45:16.885
Yes! Thank you!
And you were in the wet.

45:16.920 --> 45:19.800
That's good. I'm pleased with that.
Congratulations. Pretty good.

45:19.835 --> 45:21.777
You have improved massively.

45:21.812 --> 45:23.685
You're still quite slow.

45:23.720 --> 45:26.725
I did better, though.
You did, but the thing is,

45:26.760 --> 45:32.160
we also have another little bi of footage to
demonstrate that you're not really a car man.

45:32.195 --> 45:36.177
Well, listen, no. I know how
to drive. I don't think you do.

45:36.212 --> 45:40.125
Nor does it, it seems,
do you know how to get out of a car.

45:40.160 --> 45:44.600
It was too impossible to get out of. Would you
like to see Jonathan trying to get out of a car?

45:44.635 --> 45:47.600
I wondered why they made me
pull over there to climb out.

45:47.635 --> 45:49.880
Here we go -
Jonathan getting out of the car.

45:49.915 --> 45:53.680
I broke it.
I broke something.

45:53.715 --> 45:55.520
Ha-ha-ha!

45:58.600 --> 45:59.765
He's out!

45:59.800 --> 46:01.445
Yes!

46:01.480 --> 46:03.845
That was hard. That was...

46:03.880 --> 46:08.160
You need to take part in Le Mans where
quick driver changes are important. Say no.

46:08.195 --> 46:12.440
It's hard to get out of a car like that
and you've put things in the way! Say no

46:12.475 --> 46:15.165
to any race involving a driver
change or indeed any race.

46:15.200 --> 46:18.780
I'll come back and try and slowly
crawl up that pole of yours.

46:18.815 --> 46:22.325
Oh, come on! This show won't
be running that long. LAUGHTER

46:22.360 --> 46:27.880
It's been fantastic having you back. It's lovely being
back. Ladies and gentlemen, Jonathan Ross. Thank you.

46:27.915 --> 46:31.080
Great fun. Thank you very much.
You've been very kind.

46:31.115 --> 46:32.600
Thank you.

46:39.520 --> 46:42.565
Right, back to the main story.

46:42.600 --> 46:47.880
We've had a letter from a leading light in the
Albanian Mafia asking us to find out which is best -

46:47.915 --> 46:54.480
a Rolls, a Merc or a Yugo which, for complicated
reasons, Jeremy is using as a Bentley.

46:54.515 --> 46:57.245
Yeah. And he would not stop moaning
about it.

46:57.280 --> 47:00.005
You wouldn't stop moaning about our
interest in history. Yeah.

47:00.040 --> 47:05.360
Good point there. Word to the wise,
never go on a trip with two OLD men

47:05.395 --> 47:09.085
who keep getting teary-eyed about
the Cold War. Never go on a trip

47:09.120 --> 47:13.440
anywhere with someone who believes the
whole world should be like Birmingham.

47:21.480 --> 47:23.480
It's market day obviously -
that's nice.

47:25.440 --> 47:29.000
Taking a wheelbarrow, shovel handles
and lettuce.

47:30.840 --> 47:32.925
These little tiny patches of land

47:32.960 --> 47:37.000
each with the little tiny house on it, and
people farming it, is that to do with Communism?

47:39.000 --> 47:41.400
He is the stupidest man
in the world.

47:41.435 --> 47:43.200
I assume it is.

47:46.720 --> 47:50.440
Ooh, I've seen control towers
over there.

47:52.240 --> 47:55.080
I want to go and play
on a Cold War airfield.

47:55.115 --> 47:56.960
Oh no.

47:59.080 --> 48:05.000
'The airfield was abandoned, so assuming straight
line speed would be important to a Mafia boss

48:05.035 --> 48:09.200
'we lined the cars up on the runway
for a drag race. '

48:10.200 --> 48:13.045
This is pure Mercedes territory
we're in now.

48:13.080 --> 48:17.560
The S Class might have the smallest
engine of the three, a mere six litres,

48:17.595 --> 48:23.840
but that twin turbo-charged V12
belts out 604 brake horsepower

48:23.875 --> 48:27.320
and 737 torques.

48:29.400 --> 48:34.500
On paper, Hammond is right,
the Mercedes ought to monster it.

48:34.535 --> 48:39.565
But the Rolls-Royce does have 563bhp
AND it has eight gears

48:39.600 --> 48:43.520
where the Mercedes has only five so
this will stay on the power better.

48:43.555 --> 48:45.837
Anybody's race, this.

48:45.872 --> 48:48.120
Well, not ANYONE'S.

48:54.595 --> 48:56.125
Can I have a push?

48:56.160 --> 48:58.165
This is not customary, is it?

48:58.200 --> 49:00.520
I want to get it going
and then we'll have the race.

49:00.555 --> 49:04.160
Yeah. Go! Come on,
put your back into it.

49:04.195 --> 49:06.200
Right...

49:06.235 --> 49:08.360
What?! He's gone!

49:08.395 --> 49:09.765
Ha-ha-ha-ha!

49:09.800 --> 49:12.760
They weren't expecting me
to do that.

49:12.795 --> 49:15.297
What kind of drag race is that?!

49:15.332 --> 49:17.800
Now, come on, Bentley, come on.

49:17.835 --> 49:19.400
We have the advantage.

49:20.320 --> 49:22.120
Give me a gear. Right.

49:22.155 --> 49:25.840
Three, two, one.

49:29.275 --> 49:30.805
Woah!

49:30.840 --> 49:35.640
God that Mercedes is quick. Look at
that! This thing is unbelievably fast!

49:38.680 --> 49:40.560
100kph.

49:42.440 --> 49:45.240
Bentley now up to 130...

49:45.275 --> 49:48.525
Oh! Holy moly!

49:48.560 --> 49:50.440
240 kilometres an hour!

49:50.475 --> 49:54.160
153, 4, 5, 6, 7...

49:59.880 --> 50:01.600
260 kilometres an hour!

50:07.040 --> 50:10.485
That is actually
quite a big adrenaline hit. Oh...

50:10.520 --> 50:17.400
Quite interesting, the runway here is... has
got crazy paving, and some of the slabs are mined

50:17.435 --> 50:22.040
so they can be detonated should Albania
be invaded by a country that wants its, um,

50:22.075 --> 50:25.360
watermelons. We're doing 70 now.

50:28.120 --> 50:32.405
'With the drag race done,
I thought we should move on.

50:32.440 --> 50:36.000
'But I had forgotten I was on tour
with Brezhnev and Khrushchev. '

50:36.035 --> 50:39.200
James, you are in for a surprise.

50:39.235 --> 50:40.640
Oh, bloody hell!

50:43.840 --> 50:46.120
Oh, God! Oh... God...

50:46.155 --> 50:48.297
Those are MiG-15s.

50:48.332 --> 50:50.440
This is astonishing.

50:50.475 --> 50:51.897
That's a 19.

50:51.932 --> 50:53.285
Look at that!

50:53.320 --> 50:55.280
I mean, there's a lot of MiGs here,

50:55.315 --> 50:57.680
really a lot of MiGs.

51:07.240 --> 51:09.000
The drag race has murdered it.

51:10.400 --> 51:12.405
Come on, shut that,
let's look at this.

51:12.440 --> 51:15.920
I've never been in a better place
to let an engine cool.

51:15.955 --> 51:20.360
Oh! So these are MiG-15s?
No, that's a 19.

51:20.395 --> 51:22.165
This is a 19? Yeah.

51:22.200 --> 51:25.180
While those two are re-living
their Cold War fantasies,

51:25.215 --> 51:28.160
let me talk you through
some features of the S Class.

51:28.195 --> 51:29.897
For a start, I can a adjust

51:29.932 --> 51:31.565
the seat sides down here,

51:31.600 --> 51:34.060
the backrest sides,
the lumbar overall,

51:34.095 --> 51:36.485
the lumbar cushioning,
the shoulders.

51:36.520 --> 51:39.400
Then I access the massage menu
because I have a choice -

51:39.435 --> 51:42.280
slow and gentle, slow and
vigorous, fast and gentle,

51:42.315 --> 51:43.600
or fast and vigorous.

51:44.320 --> 51:45.965
Ooh.

51:46.000 --> 51:50.240
It's got... The ejector seat handles
are where your right shin is.

51:50.275 --> 51:53.360
This is just... Honestly
I have never been anywhere...

51:53.395 --> 51:55.125
Albania is like a museum. It is.

51:55.160 --> 51:57.800
Opening the boot lid,
it can be done with a key fob,

51:57.835 --> 52:00.520
or it can be done remotely from
within the car.

52:00.555 --> 52:02.405
But you don't want to just open it

52:02.440 --> 52:05.280
because how far do you want
your boot lid to open?

52:05.315 --> 52:06.645
I can set it here

52:06.680 --> 52:11.160
to open this much, or a little bit
wider, assuming there's room, obviously.

52:11.195 --> 52:15.365
'Back in the scrap yard,
James was starting to get boring. '

52:15.400 --> 52:20.125
I think the 17 is interesting because it
points to a lot of nascent developments

52:20.160 --> 52:24.845
in aerodynamics around that time when
transonic and supersonic flight was only just...

52:24.880 --> 52:31.000
The TU-15, two-seater version of the MiG-15 from the
Korean War. I believe that will have been built in China.

52:31.035 --> 52:36.400
When the relationship between China and Russia
broke down the Chinese made copy-engineered MiG-15s.

52:36.435 --> 52:38.240
But the flaps still work.

52:38.275 --> 52:39.760
Ailerons, dear boy.

52:42.440 --> 52:47.800
'After James's interesting lecture, I
turned my attention back to the Mulsanne. '

52:49.400 --> 52:55.080
I don't know that this new Bentley is going to
catch on with Bentley's traditional customer base -

52:55.115 --> 52:58.240
Kerry Katona, Jordan, Peter Andre,

52:58.275 --> 53:01.045
John Terry, Brian Cline,

53:01.080 --> 53:04.565
Wayne Rooney, Coleen Rooney
and so on.

53:04.600 --> 53:09.980
'But would it be perfect for a
leading light in the Albanian Mafia?

53:10.015 --> 53:15.360
'Or would he prefer one of the
others? We realised we didn't know.

53:15.395 --> 53:17.197
'So that night, James and I

53:17.232 --> 53:18.965
'dreamed up one more test

53:19.000 --> 53:23.440
'and then, in the bar,
we explained it to Hammond. '

53:23.475 --> 53:26.005
What do you mean,
"We're going to rob a bank"?

53:26.040 --> 53:30.560
It's a great test. We rob a bank,
OK? Use our three cars

53:30.595 --> 53:32.285
as the getaway cars.

53:32.320 --> 53:35.000
The ones that get away from the
police and on to the ferry

53:35.035 --> 53:38.005
and back to Corfu are good cars.

53:38.040 --> 53:40.405
If you're caught by the police
and you spend the next

53:40.440 --> 53:44.160
40 years in jail... You've got the wrong
car and you know what to blame. The Bentley

53:44.195 --> 53:47.040
might suddenly come good.
No, it won't.

53:49.040 --> 53:52.560
'The next morning,
we found a bank full of money...

53:52.595 --> 53:54.765
'and robbed it. '

53:54.800 --> 53:57.800
Going for a stroll. Look normal.
Look normal. Look normal.

53:57.835 --> 54:01.320
Yeah. Take the Merc,
that's the quickest.

54:02.800 --> 54:05.325
Oh, God. Hammond! Hammond!

54:05.360 --> 54:06.960
There we are, completely normal.

54:10.040 --> 54:11.925
My Merc...

54:11.960 --> 54:14.060
Clarkson, you BLEEP!

54:14.095 --> 54:16.160
Right, Rolls it is.

54:17.680 --> 54:19.160
Seatbelt safety.

54:23.040 --> 54:24.580
You utter BLEEP!

54:28.160 --> 54:32.280
What a pair of utter, utter cars!

54:34.120 --> 54:36.520
Where's the sign to Saranda?
I want Saranda.

54:36.555 --> 54:39.445
Oh, zebra crossing. N-not ideal.

54:39.480 --> 54:41.680
Take your time, chum, why not
I would.

54:41.715 --> 54:44.717
Saranda? Saranda? This way?

54:44.752 --> 54:47.685
That's the first time EVER

54:47.720 --> 54:52.400
in history, someone escaping from
a bank job has asked directions.

54:52.435 --> 54:55.557
Right, can we make it to the ferry

54:55.592 --> 54:58.680
to Corfu without being caught?

54:58.715 --> 55:01.520
Police, police!

55:08.240 --> 55:10.120
No! Come on!

55:12.160 --> 55:14.080
Hello.

55:14.115 --> 55:15.605
Come on!

55:15.640 --> 55:17.840
Why did we rob a bank at rush hour,
Hammond?

55:17.875 --> 55:19.205
Yu-u-uh...

55:19.240 --> 55:21.520
Why didn't we use a cashpoint
like everyone else?

55:22.440 --> 55:24.520
Undercut.

55:24.555 --> 55:25.680
Yes.

55:26.760 --> 55:29.600
'Meanwhile, in the Mulsanne... '

55:29.635 --> 55:33.480
I can't see a bloody thing.

55:33.515 --> 55:35.560
Come on!

55:38.600 --> 55:41.200
Crikey, it's the Albanian rozzers.

55:42.560 --> 55:43.800
Argh!

55:47.720 --> 55:50.320
Really annoying me now,
keeps dropping down.

55:50.355 --> 55:51.680
How do women wear tights?

55:55.360 --> 55:57.680
Ooh, squeezing, squeezing...

55:59.120 --> 56:03.520
They're getting closer. 'Eventually,
the road began to open out. '

56:03.555 --> 56:05.045
Right. Go, go, go, go, go!

56:05.080 --> 56:07.920
Everything you've got, old Roller,
come on!

56:07.955 --> 56:10.240
Move!

56:18.440 --> 56:19.920
Don't pull out. Do not...

56:23.960 --> 56:25.245
BLEEP!

56:25.280 --> 56:32.320
Strewth! How a bank robber lives to be beyond
25 years old, I don't know because it is stressy.

56:33.760 --> 56:37.200
'In a Bentley, it's VERY stressy. '

56:43.080 --> 56:45.880
The heat's all over me.

56:45.915 --> 56:49.440
Come on, Bentley.

56:52.240 --> 56:54.320
Climbing. Climbing.

56:54.355 --> 56:55.520
Ears popping.

56:58.320 --> 56:59.485
Big drop.

56:59.520 --> 57:03.280
'Annoyingly, on the damp
switchback road, Albania's Five-0

57:03.315 --> 57:05.000
'could keep up. '

57:06.800 --> 57:09.125
It rolls a bit more than the Merc.

57:09.160 --> 57:11.680
God. It's like trying to escape
in a bed!

57:11.715 --> 57:13.600
I might fall out.

57:14.640 --> 57:17.600
It's got the power.
But then you get to a corner -

57:17.635 --> 57:18.717
and this is a biggy -

57:18.752 --> 57:19.800
see, front's gone.

57:21.720 --> 57:24.960
Any curve, any dampness
and you've... Whoa.

57:34.320 --> 57:38.160
'Mercifully, though, the road soon
straightened out which meant

57:38.195 --> 57:41.160
'Hammond and I could absolutely
fly. '

57:41.195 --> 57:43.200
Go, go, go, go, go!

57:45.400 --> 57:50.965
Oh! What a machine! Yes! I like it.

57:51.000 --> 57:53.040
It's faster than I was expecting,
this Rolls.

57:55.040 --> 57:57.840
It is genuinely jaw-dropping
this thing.

58:00.120 --> 58:03.160
It feels SO fast.

58:05.760 --> 58:08.480
I think I just got air
in a Rolls-Royce.

58:08.515 --> 58:10.445
I think I did.

58:10.480 --> 58:13.800
'For James, though,
things weren't going so well. '

58:13.835 --> 58:17.240
They're gaining. They're gaining.

58:17.275 --> 58:22.565
No! Catastrophic understeer.

58:22.600 --> 58:27.040
'Up front, Richard and I had left
the rozzers far behind. '

58:30.440 --> 58:32.720
The ferry is near now.

58:32.755 --> 58:34.245
Good car, this.

58:34.280 --> 58:35.485
Not as good as my Merc

58:35.520 --> 58:37.160
but a good car none the less.

58:38.200 --> 58:42.360
This is the getaway car
of the century.

58:42.395 --> 58:44.405
If you are a leading light

58:44.440 --> 58:47.880
in the Albanian Mafia,
look no further.

58:50.200 --> 58:56.640
'Eventually, we made it to the ferry
terminal and could taste the freedom. '

58:56.675 --> 59:01.365
Go, just go! Hang on,
shouldn't we wait for James?

59:01.400 --> 59:06.040
'But James was in big trouble because
the cars chasing us had stopped

59:06.075 --> 59:08.440
'and formed a road block. '

59:10.160 --> 59:12.720
You'll never take me alive, copper.

59:16.400 --> 59:18.280
I'll see you in Spain, lads!

59:23.400 --> 59:25.380
Argh!

59:40.480 --> 59:43.520
See you, James.
It probably didn't hurt much.

59:43.555 --> 59:45.765
No... Ha-ha-ha!

59:45.800 --> 59:49.845
So James May is dead. Anyway...

59:49.880 --> 59:53.920
I love Albania.
Could you have made THAT

59:53.955 --> 59:58.397
in any other country in the world?
Exactly. Anyway,

59:58.432 --> 01:00:01.836
we must now choose which of the cars
is best. Yes,

01:00:01.871 --> 01:00:05.205
I suppose we must.
I prefer the Merc, definitely.

01:00:05.240 --> 01:00:10.640
I know that the late James May preferred
the Rolls-Royce. He made that very clear.

01:00:10.675 --> 01:00:14.477
And as the Bentley is plainly rubbish,
I think you have the casting vote.

01:00:14.512 --> 01:00:18.396
If you were a leading light of the
Albanian Mafia, which car would you buy?

01:00:18.431 --> 01:00:22.280
If I was a leading light in the Albanian
Mafia, I wouldn't BUY either of them.

01:00:22.315 --> 01:00:26.840
Good point. OK, which do you prefer?
I am minded to say the Rolls-Royce.

01:00:26.875 --> 01:00:29.045
But the problem is,
if you have one of these,

01:00:29.080 --> 01:00:33.000
one day you will pull up at a set
of lights and alongside

01:00:33.035 --> 01:00:36.920
will slide Simon Cowell in his
bigger Phantom and he'll go...

01:00:39.040 --> 01:00:44.440
I know what you mean. Be honest, you would only buy
the Ghost because you couldn't afford the Phantom.

01:00:44.475 --> 01:00:46.960
Because I don't want that, I'd have
the Mercedes. Yes!

01:00:46.995 --> 01:00:49.085
It's not really a bombshell, is it?

01:00:49.120 --> 01:00:52.140
James's death is a bombshell.
It's an inconvenience, yes.

01:00:52.175 --> 01:00:55.125
That's true. So on that
inconvenience, it's time to end.

01:00:55.160 --> 01:00:58.520
Thank you so much for watching.
See you next week. Good night.
