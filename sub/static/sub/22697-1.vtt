<font color="#ffff80"><b>Fixed & Synced by bozxphd. Enjoy The Flick</b>.</font>

01:41.167 --> 01:42.767
<i>Amen.</i>

01:48.408 --> 01:49.908
Can you believe it? Ugh.

01:49.910 --> 01:53.512
They gave me a ticket for parking
the engine in front of a hydrant.

01:53.514 --> 01:54.913
No, no, no, I was not on a call.

01:54.915 --> 01:57.582
I was getting a sandwich to
go, but that's not the point.

01:57.584 --> 01:59.351
You're not listening.
The point is,

01:59.353 --> 02:01.253
you can't give
a fireman a ticket,

02:01.255 --> 02:06.625
because he parks a fire truck
in front of a hydrant.

02:06.627 --> 02:10.562
I gotta go. I gotta finish
cooking breakfast for my kids.

02:25.344 --> 02:27.445
Okay, prayer.

02:27.447 --> 02:29.848
Dear god, thank you
for this food

02:29.850 --> 02:32.350
and for the man who made it.

02:32.352 --> 02:34.753
Thanks for my, uh, beautiful
daughter's painting,

02:34.755 --> 02:39.024
and my wife's beautiful dress.
Am I forgetting something? Oh!

02:39.026 --> 02:41.893
My son, for his confirmation.

02:41.895 --> 02:43.328
We're all very proud of him,

02:43.330 --> 02:45.564
and for the awesome wave
we just made.

02:45.566 --> 02:48.233
All right! Amen.

02:48.235 --> 02:51.269
Why do we have to waste
our time at church?

02:51.271 --> 02:53.972
I can confirm Alex right now.

02:53.974 --> 02:57.042
I confirm that Alex Duran

02:57.044 --> 02:59.210
has a crush on...

02:59.212 --> 03:00.612
Lia Abram.

03:00.614 --> 03:02.047
What?

03:02.049 --> 03:05.250
I do not! You got a girlfriend, buddy?
Congratulations.

03:05.252 --> 03:06.351
You are crazy.

03:06.353 --> 03:09.387
You are absolved from all your sins.
Okay.

03:09.389 --> 03:12.090
Now you're absolved
from all your sins!

03:12.092 --> 03:13.892
- Ay, Alicia!
- Sorry, daddy.

03:13.894 --> 03:17.495
Alex, will you go get another
carton for me in the garage?

03:17.497 --> 03:20.599
And be careful
with grandma's stuff.

05:40.439 --> 05:42.841
Did you get lost in here?

05:42.843 --> 05:45.944
We're late.
Sorry, dad.

05:48.981 --> 05:50.115
What is that?

05:50.117 --> 05:52.517
Found it in grandma's
big armoire.

05:52.519 --> 05:54.719
There's something inside of it,

05:54.721 --> 05:56.588
but no way to open it.

05:56.590 --> 05:58.823
That's impossible. Here.

06:00.960 --> 06:02.560
Can I have it?

06:02.562 --> 06:04.829
Uh, yeah, yeah, sure.

06:04.831 --> 06:09.134
Consider it your grandmother's
confirmation gift to you.

06:09.969 --> 06:12.771
We were supposed to leave by 8:30!
Shit!

06:12.773 --> 06:16.908
You said the "S" word.
That'll cost you $5.

06:16.910 --> 06:19.210
You're killing me.
What do I owe you now?

06:19.212 --> 06:21.312
- 45 bucks.
- Shit.

06:21.314 --> 06:24.215
Now it's 50.
Pay up, sucker.

06:24.217 --> 06:26.618
Hey, I almost forgot
to tell you guys.

06:26.620 --> 06:27.852
We have rats in the garage.

06:27.854 --> 06:30.321
- Are they cute?
- Far from it.

06:30.323 --> 06:33.591
Honey, remind me
to call the exterminator.

07:04.623 --> 07:06.958
Bless me, father,
for I have sinned.

07:06.960 --> 07:10.528
I snuck into an r-rated movie
with my friends,

07:10.530 --> 07:14.566
lied to my parents,
disobeyed my mom.

07:14.568 --> 07:16.000
What movie did you see?

07:16.002 --> 07:17.602
<i>Mad Max.</i>
Mmm.

07:17.604 --> 07:18.937
I love that film.

07:19.739 --> 07:22.507
I'm sorry, Alex.
Go on, please.

07:24.510 --> 07:27.212
I've had unclean thoughts
about a girl.

07:27.214 --> 07:31.316
That's normal.
It's nothing to be ashamed of.

07:31.584 --> 07:34.886
I'm sorry for these
and all of my sins.

07:35.454 --> 07:38.623
Five hail Marys,
five our fathers.

07:38.625 --> 07:41.693
You're now absolved
from these sins, my son.

07:41.695 --> 07:42.894
Thank you, father.

07:42.896 --> 07:45.263
So tell me a little more
about this girl.

07:45.265 --> 07:47.298
I just keep thinking about her.

07:47.300 --> 07:50.501
I've known her
since third grade.

07:50.503 --> 07:51.469
We grew up together.

07:51.471 --> 07:54.572
So you like her now
as more than just a friend.

07:54.574 --> 07:57.976
I don't know.

07:57.978 --> 08:00.645
I mean, I like
hanging out with her.

08:00.647 --> 08:01.446
She's cool.

08:01.448 --> 08:03.514
I think you should
flip the script on her.

08:03.516 --> 08:05.483
How?
Ask her out on a date.

08:05.485 --> 08:07.285
I thought priests couldn't date.

08:07.287 --> 08:10.121
You're not a priest, Alex,
at least not yet.

08:10.123 --> 08:11.723
But if you're serious
about becoming one,

08:11.725 --> 08:14.359
you need to know what it is
that you're giving up.

08:14.361 --> 08:18.830
Trust me. I know
what I'm talking about.

08:19.031 --> 08:20.932
I almost got married

08:21.267 --> 08:24.836
before I took my vows,
back in the military.

08:24.838 --> 08:28.373
Alex, I have known you
since the day you were born.

08:28.375 --> 08:31.276
I baptized you.
You're a good kid.

08:31.610 --> 08:32.710
So, ask this girl out.

08:32.712 --> 08:36.547
See if she's more than
just a friend, okay?

08:36.782 --> 08:38.650
Thanks, father.

08:45.257 --> 08:50.428
Confirm, O lord, your servant
with your holy spirit.

09:02.074 --> 09:05.410
Alejandro Duran Delgado.

09:05.412 --> 09:11.349
Confirm, O lord, your servant
with your holy spirit.

09:11.351 --> 09:13.084
Amen.

09:18.023 --> 09:20.325
Congratulations and prayers,

09:20.327 --> 09:24.896
as you are strengthened
by the holy spirit.

09:24.898 --> 09:27.031
God bless you always.

09:41.013 --> 09:43.715
<i>I mean, it's beautiful.</i>

09:45.918 --> 09:48.686
Whoever made it
is a real craftsman.

09:49.655 --> 09:52.657
But see? There's no seams.

09:56.662 --> 09:59.664
Whatever's in there must've
been sealed from the inside.

09:59.666 --> 10:01.699
How do you do that?

10:02.968 --> 10:05.003
I don't know.

10:05.237 --> 10:06.738
I don't know.

10:06.740 --> 10:09.474
Are you sure you want me to cut it open?
It may be valuable.

10:09.476 --> 10:12.643
I want to find out
what's inside.

10:12.811 --> 10:14.946
Me too. Let's do it.

10:40.906 --> 10:42.707
Be careful, dad.

11:08.834 --> 11:10.435
Are you okay?

11:10.437 --> 11:11.836
Yeah, I think so.

11:11.838 --> 11:13.738
That was so weird.

11:13.740 --> 11:15.173
What happened?

11:15.175 --> 11:17.708
I don't know.

11:17.710 --> 11:19.844
Wait, wait, wait, look.

11:34.059 --> 11:35.793
I wonder whose it was.
Who knows?

11:35.795 --> 11:38.429
Your grandmother bought
and sold old furniture.

11:38.431 --> 11:39.397
Could've been anybody's.

11:39.399 --> 11:41.699
Why would someone hide it
in a box like that?

11:41.701 --> 11:43.768
That's a good question.
I don't know.

11:43.770 --> 11:45.570
But, it's yours now.

13:08.654 --> 13:11.155
Let's go, father Flanagan!

13:12.457 --> 13:14.158
What an asshole.

13:14.160 --> 13:17.662
As a part of our
<i>bare, not legal</i> series,

13:17.664 --> 13:20.898
we approach the home of
16-year-old Lia Abrams.

13:20.900 --> 13:23.968
We shouldn't do this. Hey,
this was your idea, Alex.

13:23.970 --> 13:26.837
I wanted to ask her to be
in one of our crazy videos,

13:26.839 --> 13:28.272
not perv out on her
for the Internet.

13:28.274 --> 13:30.508
Yeah, man, this isn't cool.
We should go.

13:30.510 --> 13:33.144
Screw you guys.
I'm doing this.

13:33.146 --> 13:34.712
Now, we know she's not legal.

13:34.714 --> 13:38.316
The big question is,
is she bare?

13:39.084 --> 13:39.984
Let's find out.

13:39.986 --> 13:43.821
There's no one here. It's 10
o'clock, she should be here.

13:43.823 --> 13:45.289
Oh, shit, there she is.

13:45.291 --> 13:47.758
- This isn't right, Everett.
- Stop recording.

13:47.760 --> 13:50.728
Hey, shut up.
Look at that. Oh, shit.

13:50.730 --> 13:52.129
Come on, Everett,
stop recording.

13:52.131 --> 13:56.133
Hey, Alex,
your dream's coming true.

13:56.135 --> 13:58.069
Shut up and turn off the camera.

13:58.071 --> 13:59.937
Oh, you like it, come on.

13:59.939 --> 14:01.205
I said stop it now!

14:01.207 --> 14:05.142
What the... Come on, dude!
What the fuck?

14:05.144 --> 14:06.444
Come on!

14:06.446 --> 14:08.546
Alex?
I tried to stop him.

14:08.548 --> 14:10.581
I expect that shit from him,
but not you.

14:10.583 --> 14:13.117
He'll delete it.
I promise.

14:13.119 --> 14:15.119
I'll make sure of it myself.

14:15.121 --> 14:17.188
You better.

14:18.457 --> 14:21.225
You're watching it again?

14:21.227 --> 14:23.394
Told you she had a nice body.

14:23.396 --> 14:26.063
We should just keep it.
Tell her you deleted it.

14:26.065 --> 14:29.400
I'm not gonna lie to her.
I made her a promise.

14:29.402 --> 14:31.569
No, no, don't!
Don't delete that!

14:31.571 --> 14:32.703
Wait, wait!

14:32.705 --> 14:34.538
Oh, fuck!

14:41.880 --> 14:42.980
Hi.

14:42.982 --> 14:44.949
<i>Did he delete it?</i>

14:44.951 --> 14:47.285
He deleted it.
Swear to god?

14:47.287 --> 14:50.187
You know I can't do that,
but I promise.

14:50.189 --> 14:52.123
I made sure of it myself.

14:52.125 --> 14:54.125
<i>So you watched it.</i>

14:54.127 --> 14:55.359
Um...

14:55.361 --> 14:56.360
<i>You look guilty, Alex.</i>

14:56.362 --> 14:58.929
<i>Is there something
you need to confess?</i>

14:59.798 --> 15:01.399
Okay, I watched it,

15:01.401 --> 15:03.134
but only to make sure
that he didn't...

15:03.136 --> 15:06.203
<i>I didn't know you were
such a bad boy, Alex.</i>

15:07.139 --> 15:08.639
I'm not.

15:09.241 --> 15:11.642
<i>All right, bad boy, I got to go.</i>

15:11.644 --> 15:13.678
<i>Good night.</i>
Wait.

15:14.546 --> 15:16.914
What are you doing
Saturday night?

15:16.916 --> 15:19.583
<i>Are you asking me out on a date?</i>

15:19.585 --> 15:21.952
Yeah, I am.

15:21.954 --> 15:24.789
<i>I thought we were just friends.</i>

15:24.791 --> 15:26.524
Uh, I mean, we are, but...

15:26.526 --> 15:28.859
<i>Pick me up at seven.</i>

15:29.227 --> 15:30.528
I don't have my license yet.

15:30.530 --> 15:35.533
<i>Yeah, right, um...
I'll pick you up at seven.</i>

15:36.435 --> 15:37.968
Okay.

15:38.637 --> 15:41.205
<i>Bye.</i>
Bye.

18:12.324 --> 18:14.892
Are you contagious?

18:14.894 --> 18:16.360
No, I don't think so.

18:16.362 --> 18:21.565
If you're contagious, you need to
sanitize everything you touch.

18:21.567 --> 18:22.833
It's just an upset stomach.

18:22.835 --> 18:25.002
I think you have Ebola.

18:25.004 --> 18:26.504
I don't have Ebola.

18:27.473 --> 18:29.607
Look, just tell father cutler
I'll be right down.

18:29.609 --> 18:34.778
Father cutler,
Alex says he'll be right down!

18:35.380 --> 18:38.148
<i>O holy hosts above,</i>

18:38.150 --> 18:41.252
I call upon thee
as a servant of Jesus Christ

18:41.254 --> 18:44.522
to sanctify our actions
this day in preparation

18:44.524 --> 18:46.357
for the fulfillment
of the will of god.

18:46.359 --> 18:50.094
We ask you that you receive
this child into your arms,

18:50.096 --> 18:52.963
that she may pass in safety
from this crisis.

19:00.472 --> 19:04.208
She wants to know
if she's going to heaven.

19:05.977 --> 19:09.280
Tell her to trust
in the lord, Alex.

19:09.848 --> 19:12.750
He always looks out
for his children.

19:29.501 --> 19:35.472
By this sign, thou art
absolved from all past errors,

19:35.474 --> 19:39.944
free to take your place in the
world he's prepared for us,

19:39.946 --> 19:42.513
to dwell in the house
of the lord forever.

19:44.283 --> 19:46.150
Amen.

19:46.152 --> 19:48.552
Amen.

21:05.531 --> 21:07.564
Ow! Goddamn it!

21:07.566 --> 21:09.066
Alex!

21:09.068 --> 21:11.301
Uh, sorry, mom.

21:12.070 --> 21:14.905
I don't know why I said that.

21:20.211 --> 21:21.979
Where did you get that?

21:21.981 --> 21:26.517
Uh, I found it
in grandma's armoire.

21:26.885 --> 21:28.385
Why?

21:30.822 --> 21:33.223
It was your grandfather's.

21:36.394 --> 21:37.695
Mom, Alex!

21:37.697 --> 21:41.565
Show starts in 10 seconds!
Ten, nine...

21:41.567 --> 21:45.636
Let's go.
Eight, seven, six, five,

21:45.638 --> 21:49.239
four, three, two, one!

22:41.559 --> 22:43.560
I can't believe
you let him keep it.

22:43.562 --> 22:45.963
How was I supposed to know
it was your father's?

22:45.965 --> 22:47.998
It was in some stupid
wooden box.

22:48.000 --> 22:49.032
Marcos...

22:52.171 --> 22:56.206
My father was a carpenter.
Of course it was his.

22:56.208 --> 22:57.574
Now every time I look at it,

22:57.576 --> 22:59.042
I have to think about
what happened.

22:59.044 --> 23:01.111
I'm not comfortable
with Alex having it.

23:01.113 --> 23:03.480
I know, I know.

23:03.782 --> 23:06.150
What do you want me to do?

23:08.487 --> 23:13.090
If I take it away from him,
he's going to ask why.

23:14.125 --> 23:15.926
Lucia.

23:16.261 --> 23:18.362
Lu...

23:18.797 --> 23:22.166
I'm so fucking pissed at you.

23:26.704 --> 23:28.205
Lucia.

23:33.711 --> 23:35.512
I don't like him wearing it.

23:35.514 --> 23:39.349
I know. I know, baby,
neither do I.

23:39.351 --> 23:43.287
But you know what can happen
if he starts to ask questions.

23:43.688 --> 23:47.124
He might remember
what your dad did to him.

23:47.425 --> 23:49.426
Do we want that?

23:53.932 --> 23:55.799
Okay.

23:55.801 --> 23:59.970
I'll let him keep it, for now.
Okay.

24:00.672 --> 24:02.472
Okay.

24:04.042 --> 24:07.644
"I'm so fucking pissed
at you."

24:08.012 --> 24:10.714
I love you.
I'm so sorry.

24:11.482 --> 24:13.350
I love you.

24:29.901 --> 24:33.103
Hail Mary, full of grace,
the lord is with thee.

27:39.058 --> 27:40.058
No.

28:06.684 --> 28:08.385
Huh?

28:42.353 --> 28:44.788
God is a liar!

28:51.896 --> 28:52.762
Alex!

28:52.764 --> 28:54.798
What's wrong?
Are you okay?

28:54.800 --> 28:56.933
Honey, what happened?

28:58.035 --> 29:01.171
There was someone in here.

29:01.173 --> 29:01.838
What?

29:01.840 --> 29:03.507
Son, there's no one in here.

29:03.509 --> 29:06.143
You guys scared me, daddy.
Oh, sorry, baby.

29:06.145 --> 29:07.310
Come here, come here.

29:07.312 --> 29:09.079
Are you okay?
Did you wake up?

29:09.081 --> 29:12.082
I don't know what happened.

29:12.084 --> 29:18.655
It was dark, and he was
hiding in my closet.

29:20.191 --> 29:22.125
He spoke to me.

29:22.894 --> 29:24.728
I think we need
to call the police.

29:24.730 --> 29:27.297
Wait, wait, what did he say?

29:28.599 --> 29:31.801
He said, "god is a liar."

29:32.403 --> 29:34.104
Maybe it was a nightmare.

29:34.106 --> 29:35.906
It wasn't a fucking nightmare!

29:35.908 --> 29:38.275
I was awake!
Let's get you to bed.

29:38.277 --> 29:41.111
It's okay, honey. Come on.

29:41.113 --> 29:42.212
Shh, shh, shh.

29:42.214 --> 29:44.548
Honey, are you okay?

29:45.183 --> 29:47.017
Yeah.

29:47.818 --> 29:49.653
I'm okay.

29:52.423 --> 29:55.892
Promise you'll wake me
if you need anything.

29:55.894 --> 29:57.294
Yeah.

29:57.296 --> 29:58.795
I love you.

29:58.797 --> 30:00.897
Love you too.

30:29.660 --> 30:32.462
Yo, we should get Alex
a hooker for his birthday.

30:32.464 --> 30:33.830
Aren't they expensive?

30:33.832 --> 30:34.631
No, dude.

30:34.633 --> 30:37.167
You can get one for like
60 bucks off the Internet.

30:37.169 --> 30:38.602
How do you know?

30:40.239 --> 30:41.404
That is disgusting.

30:41.406 --> 30:42.806
Hey, yo, Alex, it's gonna suck

30:42.808 --> 30:44.574
when you gotta retire
from the pussy patrol, bro.

30:44.576 --> 30:48.345
That's why you got to have as much sex
as you can before they cut it off.

30:50.381 --> 30:52.549
Right, Alex?

30:52.551 --> 30:54.351
What?

30:55.119 --> 30:56.653
Yeah.

30:56.655 --> 30:59.656
I mean, no,
they don't cut it off.

30:59.658 --> 31:02.292
Does it matter?
You can never use it again.

31:02.294 --> 31:04.594
Maybe giving up sex
won't be such a big deal.

31:04.596 --> 31:08.064
How the fuck do you know? You don't
even know what you're giving up.

31:08.066 --> 31:09.199
That's savage, Gavin.

31:09.201 --> 31:11.468
Why do you want to be a
priest anyway, dude?

31:11.470 --> 31:14.070
Yeah, man, I mean,
becoming a priest,

31:14.072 --> 31:16.573
you gotta admit,
that shit's pretty weird.

31:16.575 --> 31:18.508
I told you guys.
I want to help people.

31:18.510 --> 31:21.444
There's a million ways
to help people

31:21.446 --> 31:23.313
and still bang bitches.

31:23.315 --> 31:27.250
You're a real neanderthal,
aren't you?

31:28.719 --> 31:31.121
Do you guys believe in ghosts?

31:32.023 --> 31:35.091
Yo, you're tripping
off that beer, lightweight.

31:35.093 --> 31:36.593
Might wanna put that shit down.

31:36.595 --> 31:41.931
No, seriously,
do you believe in ghosts?

31:44.735 --> 31:47.804
Um, I do.

31:48.139 --> 31:49.105
I believe in ghosts.

31:49.107 --> 31:54.644
I thought I saw one once
after my dad died.

31:56.747 --> 31:58.748
Why, man?

31:58.750 --> 32:01.017
Seeing ghosts?

32:02.753 --> 32:06.823
No. I was just wondering.

32:11.862 --> 32:15.265
<i>So the thing is,
I learned something</i>

32:15.267 --> 32:16.666
<i>when I decided
to be a dog owner,</i>

32:16.668 --> 32:18.268
<i>and the biggest kind of,
like, epiphany that I had</i>

32:18.270 --> 32:23.039
<i>was that you have to do things
to keep it alive.</i>

32:25.977 --> 32:27.911
<i>Don't you?</i>

32:27.913 --> 32:29.412
<i>Yes, it's true.
You have to feed it,</i>

32:29.414 --> 32:32.982
<i>then you have to walk it, then
you have to trim the nails.</i>

32:32.984 --> 32:34.651
So, a comedy album,

32:34.653 --> 32:38.321
is that your big move
with all the girls?

32:38.323 --> 32:39.189
What girls?

32:39.191 --> 32:41.558
If you're ever going to have
a shot with any other girls,

32:41.560 --> 32:43.293
you're going to need
to get some game.

32:43.295 --> 32:45.929
Oh, yeah? Like what?

32:45.931 --> 32:49.099
Well, most of the girls
I know like bad boys,

32:49.101 --> 32:51.935
so instead of taking
them out to dinner,

32:51.937 --> 32:54.037
take them out for a drink.

32:54.039 --> 32:56.373
I'm not old enough
to buy alcohol.

32:56.375 --> 32:59.542
Come on, Alex,
don't be such a pussy.

32:59.544 --> 33:02.178
You need to let
your inner bad boy out

33:02.180 --> 33:03.813
and lose the comedy album.

33:03.815 --> 33:07.016
Play something that's going
to get them in the mood.

33:22.768 --> 33:24.267
I don't want any other girls.

33:42.053 --> 33:42.952
That was amazing.

33:42.954 --> 33:46.055
Much better than our first kiss.

33:46.057 --> 33:46.956
You remember?

33:46.958 --> 33:51.628
Truth or dare, Mark Bartolotti's
eighth birthday party.

33:51.862 --> 33:53.263
That was my first kiss.

33:53.265 --> 33:57.100
Well, this one was much better.

33:57.802 --> 34:01.004
Are you sure you want
to be a priest?

34:01.006 --> 34:06.042
I mean, like, you won't be
able to do this any more.

34:12.349 --> 34:14.250
What's wrong?

34:15.453 --> 34:18.487
I'm not sure about this.

34:20.224 --> 34:23.960
Don't be scared, it's okay.

34:28.299 --> 34:30.400
Are you all right?

34:32.735 --> 34:33.570
I'm sorry.

34:33.572 --> 34:36.739
No, no, don't be.
It's okay.

35:00.297 --> 35:03.266
We can take it slow, you know.

35:04.768 --> 35:06.836
I had fun tonight.

35:08.005 --> 35:10.473
I'd like to see you again.

35:12.910 --> 35:14.711
Okay.

35:14.713 --> 35:17.046
Bye.
Bye.

35:54.051 --> 35:55.451
There.
You gotta catch it.

35:55.453 --> 35:58.054
I can't catch it.
Well, you gotta try.

36:00.325 --> 36:03.359
You were supposed to grab...
You gotta grab it.

36:03.361 --> 36:05.495
Okay, if you don't grab it...

36:05.497 --> 36:07.897
No, no!
Come on. Really?

36:10.267 --> 36:11.734
Ready?
No.

36:11.736 --> 36:12.802
Milo's got some strength.

36:12.804 --> 36:14.671
Here we go.
Let's do this.

36:15.373 --> 36:18.174
Don't lose this!
Here we go!

36:21.947 --> 36:23.099
You gotta stop scratching me.

36:23.124 --> 36:25.481
You don't know me like that.
You don't know me like that.

36:25.483 --> 36:27.750
Is it?

36:27.752 --> 36:29.586
No!

37:23.374 --> 37:26.075
Stop! Alex,
what are you doing?

37:26.077 --> 37:28.111
Just stop, man.

37:28.113 --> 37:29.679
Yo! Yo!

37:29.681 --> 37:30.980
What the fuck
are you doing, man?

37:30.982 --> 37:34.651
Alex! Alex, what are you...
Cut it out, man!

37:34.653 --> 37:36.419
Alex!

37:36.987 --> 37:39.155
Get off of him!
Get off of him!

37:39.157 --> 37:41.324
Get the fuck off me!

37:41.326 --> 37:42.692
What the fuck
is wrong with you, man?

37:42.694 --> 37:45.895
Fuck you guys.
I don't need your shit.

37:46.463 --> 37:48.831
What the fuck was that?

38:59.803 --> 39:02.105
Okay, I'm going
to take off your cuffs.

39:02.107 --> 39:04.540
Don't fucking touch me.

39:06.511 --> 39:07.710
Turn around and face me.

39:07.712 --> 39:09.679
Keep your hands
behind your back.

39:09.681 --> 39:10.880
I need to take your cross.

39:10.882 --> 39:13.416
You can't have it.
I need that.

39:13.418 --> 39:15.551
This is bullshit.

39:18.856 --> 39:21.557
All right, step inside.

39:22.392 --> 39:24.560
Have a seat.

39:24.562 --> 39:27.130
We're gonna call your parents.

40:09.773 --> 40:13.810
Please, please, don't.

40:14.645 --> 40:18.347
God is a liar.

40:20.718 --> 40:23.152
Please, don't.

41:02.226 --> 41:04.493
Alex, what happened?

41:04.495 --> 41:07.864
Fighting, stealing cars,
drunk driving?

41:07.866 --> 41:09.465
What's going on with you?

41:09.467 --> 41:11.801
Made a mistake.
You made a mistake?

41:11.803 --> 41:14.036
You know, you could've
killed yourself.

41:14.038 --> 41:15.504
You know that?
Or someone else!

41:15.506 --> 41:18.507
And now, with court costs
and lawyer fees,

41:18.509 --> 41:20.309
your mistake is gonna
cost us about 10 grand.

41:20.311 --> 41:22.311
Oh, yeah, you're gonna
pay us that money back.

41:22.313 --> 41:24.313
How do you feel about that,
father fuck-up?

41:24.315 --> 41:27.283
What the fuck
do you want from me?

41:27.285 --> 41:28.551
I said I was sorry.

41:28.553 --> 41:32.188
You don't give a shit
about me. You never have.

41:32.190 --> 41:34.290
I'm not like you,
and you hate me for it.

41:34.292 --> 41:36.692
Alex! You think I'm
a pussy, don't you?

41:36.694 --> 41:38.761
Watch your mouth!
But what you hate most

41:38.763 --> 41:40.596
is that I'm smarter than you.

41:40.598 --> 41:43.332
You know it's true.
Mom knows it too.

41:43.334 --> 41:46.836
You should just see the way
she looks at you sometimes,

41:46.838 --> 41:49.772
what she says to her friends
behind your back.

41:49.774 --> 41:52.174
No wonder your father
beat the shit out of you.

41:52.176 --> 41:54.343
What did you say?

41:54.345 --> 41:55.578
No, wait.
No, please!

41:55.580 --> 41:57.847
I'll teach you.
Please don't!

41:57.849 --> 41:59.282
Get off of me!

41:59.284 --> 42:02.785
You're no better than dad.
You abandoned grandma.

42:02.787 --> 42:04.954
You let your own mother
die alone.

42:04.956 --> 42:06.155
How many days was she dead

42:06.157 --> 42:09.592
before they found
her rotting body?

42:09.594 --> 42:12.061
You apologize to your mother!

42:12.063 --> 42:13.663
Fuck you!

42:13.665 --> 42:16.198
Motherfucker!

42:16.200 --> 42:17.767
Fuck!

42:21.471 --> 42:24.640
Do you know why you're here?

42:27.577 --> 42:31.447
We've seen each other before.
Do you remember me?

42:37.087 --> 42:40.923
You were five years old.
We had a few sessions.

42:43.860 --> 42:47.964
Why would a 5-year-old boy
need to see a psychiatrist?

42:49.533 --> 42:52.101
Your parents
were worried about you,

42:54.638 --> 42:57.940
because you were drawing
scary pictures.

43:02.346 --> 43:07.483
Your parents tell me that you've
been having trouble sleeping.

43:09.686 --> 43:12.021
I've been hearing...

43:13.457 --> 43:15.891
I've been having nightmares

43:15.893 --> 43:21.530
where I hear a voice
whispering to me.

43:23.266 --> 43:25.634
It pretends to...
It?

43:28.672 --> 43:31.007
I mean, "he."

43:32.376 --> 43:35.311
And what does
the voice say to you?

43:36.580 --> 43:38.214
It...

43:39.349 --> 43:41.851
It curses god.

43:49.493 --> 43:51.027
Doctor?

43:52.329 --> 43:54.030
Yes, Alex.

43:54.032 --> 43:57.700
You said I was drawing
scary pictures.

44:01.438 --> 44:04.407
What kind of scary pictures?

45:45.041 --> 45:47.610
<i>Hey, Alex.</i>
Hey.

45:48.378 --> 45:50.146
<i>What's up?</i>

45:50.148 --> 45:53.682
I wanted to apologize
for the other day.

45:53.917 --> 45:57.453
<i>It's okay.
You don't have to apologize.</i>

45:58.488 --> 45:59.922
Can you come out?

45:59.924 --> 46:03.492
<i>Uh, yeah.
I'll pick you up.</i>

46:04.427 --> 46:06.128
All right.

46:06.130 --> 46:07.563
I'll be ready.

46:07.565 --> 46:09.498
<i>Bye.</i>

46:17.707 --> 46:20.176
How many people
do you think are down there?

46:20.178 --> 46:22.411
I don't know.

46:24.714 --> 46:27.783
Do you think any of them
are worth it?

46:28.185 --> 46:30.019
What?

46:32.889 --> 46:34.823
You look really good tonight.

46:34.825 --> 46:38.227
You always look good.

46:39.029 --> 46:42.698
Thanks, Alex.
That's really sweet.

46:45.035 --> 46:48.637
I'm sorry again
about the other day,

46:48.639 --> 46:50.839
for acting so crazy.
It's just...

46:50.841 --> 46:51.707
It's okay.

46:51.709 --> 46:56.078
You know, we all go
a little crazy sometimes.

46:57.447 --> 47:01.850
You just looked so hot
in that bikini.

47:02.285 --> 47:05.854
And when I saw you
with Gavin, I...

47:06.456 --> 47:08.457
I couldn't take it.

47:08.459 --> 47:12.895
Well, I like
that you got jealous.

47:33.316 --> 47:34.750
Ow. Hey.

47:52.503 --> 47:55.004
What the fuck is wrong with you?

47:55.006 --> 47:56.639
Sorry.

47:56.641 --> 47:59.908
I don't know
what's happening to me.

48:55.066 --> 48:57.166
Alejandro?

48:59.936 --> 49:01.937
You scared me.

49:06.509 --> 49:11.046
Can I ask you a question
about my grandfather?

49:12.115 --> 49:14.216
What about him?

49:15.485 --> 49:18.153
Was he a religious man?

49:19.656 --> 49:21.423
Not always.

49:21.425 --> 49:23.292
He became religious
later in life.

49:23.294 --> 49:26.528
That's when he started
to wear that crucifix.

49:27.063 --> 49:29.431
He thought it protected him.

49:30.900 --> 49:34.903
He had psychological problems,

49:34.905 --> 49:37.740
and he was never
treated for them.

49:40.543 --> 49:42.811
He hurt people,

49:43.646 --> 49:47.883
and religion was his way
of dealing with his guilt.

49:50.620 --> 49:52.988
What did he do?

50:01.564 --> 50:06.301
Sometimes people do things
that they're ashamed of.

50:07.704 --> 50:12.441
They want to be good, but
they're just not in control.

50:14.844 --> 50:17.279
How did he die?

50:22.218 --> 50:24.420
He hung himself.

50:28.758 --> 50:31.226
<i>I'm scared, father.</i>

50:33.263 --> 50:36.231
What are you scared of?

50:39.402 --> 50:40.936
Alex?

50:44.441 --> 50:46.875
Do you believe in demons?

50:47.710 --> 50:51.013
I believe that demons,

50:51.015 --> 50:53.549
evil spirits,
and the devil himself

50:53.551 --> 50:55.617
represent man's darkest desires.

50:55.619 --> 51:01.957
We all have impulses, Alex, impulses
that weaken us and lead us astray.

51:01.959 --> 51:05.227
I've been having these...

51:07.864 --> 51:09.965
Experiences.

51:13.036 --> 51:16.472
And I just don't know
how to explain them.

51:17.540 --> 51:19.708
Alex, I had...

51:22.111 --> 51:24.913
I had some deep
emotional problems

51:24.915 --> 51:27.483
when I came back from the war.

51:28.618 --> 51:31.420
These types of experiences
are most often

51:31.422 --> 51:35.390
psychological manifestations
of a deeper problem.

51:36.259 --> 51:38.660
So you're saying

51:39.762 --> 51:41.530
these things are all in my head?

51:41.532 --> 51:44.633
I want you to talk to your
therapist about this.

51:44.635 --> 51:47.269
And trust her, Alex, trust her.

51:47.271 --> 51:51.006
And know that I'm always here
for you, if you need me.

51:52.742 --> 51:55.277
But what if they are real?

52:03.486 --> 52:08.790
Gracious heavenly father,
in Jesus Christ's name,

52:08.792 --> 52:13.061
I ask for your help
in a young man's time of need.

52:24.541 --> 52:26.508
O lord, Jesus Christ,

52:26.510 --> 52:28.143
I pray for the wisdom

52:28.145 --> 52:30.078
and the power
of your holy spirit

52:30.080 --> 52:33.215
and the presence
of your holy angels.

52:35.418 --> 52:37.619
<i>God is a liar.</i>

54:07.777 --> 54:09.845
Shh...

54:28.931 --> 54:30.799
No!

54:35.706 --> 54:38.473
No!

55:16.479 --> 55:18.714
Surprise!

55:28.491 --> 55:30.625
Sixteen!
I can't believe it.

55:30.627 --> 55:32.294
We are so proud of you.

55:32.296 --> 55:36.298
Cut! I'm making
a comedy, not a drama!

55:36.300 --> 55:37.632
Hey!

55:37.634 --> 55:40.001
Here comes the hug monster!

55:40.003 --> 55:42.304
No! Yuck, daddy!

55:42.306 --> 55:43.872
It's so cool.

55:43.874 --> 55:46.041
Oh, my god, it's so great.

55:57.153 --> 55:59.721
Happy birthday, Alex.

56:03.392 --> 56:04.626
What are you guys doing here?

56:04.628 --> 56:07.996
Your parents invited us.
Do you want us to leave?

56:07.998 --> 56:09.631
No.

56:09.633 --> 56:11.566
It's just I thought
you guys hated me.

56:11.568 --> 56:15.370
We can never hate you, man.
You're family.

56:18.875 --> 56:22.677
I'm really sorry
for the way I acted

56:23.079 --> 56:25.280
and what I did.

56:26.382 --> 56:30.685
We're here for you,
Alex, all of us.

56:32.789 --> 56:35.657
I have to tell you something.

56:37.260 --> 56:39.561
In private.

56:39.563 --> 56:41.863
Okay, yeah.

56:41.865 --> 56:45.534
Come on, man. You're
just fucking with us.

56:45.536 --> 56:48.603
I'm being serious, Everett.

56:49.672 --> 56:51.339
It's real.

56:52.008 --> 56:54.142
It's haunting me.

56:55.178 --> 56:59.147
I think it haunted me
when I was a little boy,

57:01.017 --> 57:03.118
and now it's back.

57:04.153 --> 57:07.189
Have you spoken with
your therapist about this?

57:07.191 --> 57:12.460
No. There's nothing
she can do for me.

57:12.929 --> 57:15.163
What do you think it is?

57:15.998 --> 57:17.766
It's an evil spirit.

57:17.768 --> 57:21.203
And what the hell does
an evil spirit want with you?

57:25.942 --> 57:28.410
It wants to possess me.

57:57.007 --> 57:59.541
Make a wish, honey.

58:08.618 --> 58:13.655
The doctors called it
a cryptogenic stroke.

58:13.956 --> 58:17.726
That only means
they can't find a cause.

58:18.628 --> 58:24.299
When you left confession,
Alex, I was worried about you.

58:25.134 --> 58:26.968
While I was praying,

58:28.237 --> 58:30.372
I heard things,

58:30.973 --> 58:33.275
and I saw things,

58:33.876 --> 58:35.844
and I felt something,

58:35.846 --> 58:38.980
feelings I haven't had
since the war.

58:40.082 --> 58:41.683
What kind of things?

58:41.685 --> 58:46.421
The kind of things you only
tell your priest in confession.

58:52.061 --> 58:55.764
Have you ever heard
of the phrase,

58:57.199 --> 59:00.535
"in these demonic shadows
of evil spirits

59:00.537 --> 59:04.773
"shall rise up against
the children of men"?

59:09.779 --> 59:11.279
It's from the book of Enoch.

59:11.281 --> 59:15.850
It's an ancient religious work
ascribed to Enoch,

59:15.852 --> 59:17.919
the great grandfather of Noah.

59:17.921 --> 59:21.690
But it's not considered
biblical canon,

59:21.692 --> 59:24.459
at least not by
the catholic church.

59:26.162 --> 59:30.632
I always thought they were
just cautionary stories.

59:32.268 --> 59:34.369
But now...

59:34.637 --> 59:37.672
Now I don't know
what to believe.

59:39.041 --> 59:44.179
Alex, have you told
anyone else about this?

01:00:25.355 --> 01:00:26.654
Alex?

01:00:26.656 --> 01:00:29.257
No, no, no!

01:00:29.525 --> 01:00:31.593
I don't want to see.

01:00:41.038 --> 01:00:42.237
Mom?

01:00:47.309 --> 01:00:50.945
Please don't make me watch.

01:00:50.947 --> 01:00:53.581
Mom?

01:01:21.811 --> 01:01:22.777
Alex.

01:01:22.779 --> 01:01:25.613
It's okay, Alex.
Just relax.

01:01:25.615 --> 01:01:30.351
We have to fight this.
Just calm yourself down.

01:01:30.353 --> 01:01:32.821
You need to be strong.

01:01:42.298 --> 01:01:44.933
Mom, is... is that you?

01:01:46.535 --> 01:01:48.336
Mom?

01:02:28.744 --> 01:02:29.944
Help! Help!

01:03:15.424 --> 01:03:17.725
I spoke with the bishop.

01:03:17.727 --> 01:03:18.626
That was a mistake.

01:03:18.628 --> 01:03:22.997
Alex, the diocese has experts,
priests who specialize.

01:03:22.999 --> 01:03:25.900
They'll conduct
an investigation.

01:03:26.135 --> 01:03:28.069
How long will that take?

01:03:28.404 --> 01:03:29.971
It's not an exact science.

01:03:29.973 --> 01:03:31.372
These things take time.

01:03:31.374 --> 01:03:33.641
I don't have time.

01:03:34.677 --> 01:03:36.211
You can't give up, Alex.

01:03:36.213 --> 01:03:37.779
You need to stay strong.

01:03:37.781 --> 01:03:39.514
Evil strikes when we're weakest.

01:03:39.516 --> 01:03:43.184
It feeds on negative feelings,
fear, regret.

01:03:43.186 --> 01:03:45.787
We're up against
something very powerful,

01:03:45.789 --> 01:03:47.722
very dangerous and deadly.

01:03:47.724 --> 01:03:51.893
The only way to fight back
is with strength.

01:03:57.666 --> 01:04:01.970
<i>Our community has suffered
a terrible tragedy.</i>

01:04:01.972 --> 01:04:09.344
And you may ask why has god
done such an awful thing.

01:04:10.346 --> 01:04:12.046
But know this,

01:04:12.048 --> 01:04:16.551
death will not have
the last word.

01:04:17.219 --> 01:04:20.989
For Jesus Christ
conquered death.

01:04:20.991 --> 01:04:23.391
Jesus rose.

01:04:24.560 --> 01:04:29.030
And we too shall rise
in the afterlife.

01:04:36.939 --> 01:04:40.742
"Thus has the whole earth
been filled with blood

01:04:40.744 --> 01:04:42.610
"and with iniquity.

01:04:42.612 --> 01:04:46.214
"The souls of those
who are dead cry out,

01:04:46.216 --> 01:04:50.318
"and the giants shall be called
upon earth's evil spirits.

01:04:50.320 --> 01:04:54.355
"They shall rise up against
the children of men

01:04:54.357 --> 01:04:56.090
"in order to devour them.

01:04:56.092 --> 01:05:00.662
"For they come forth during the
days of slaughter and destruction."

01:05:02.832 --> 01:05:06.801
Alex, can I come in?

01:05:07.269 --> 01:05:08.970
Yeah.

01:05:14.710 --> 01:05:16.978
I'm scared.

01:05:18.247 --> 01:05:20.315
Don't be scared.

01:05:20.317 --> 01:05:23.151
I won't let anything bad
happen to you.

01:05:24.586 --> 01:05:26.521
I promise.

01:05:41.136 --> 01:05:43.137
I love you.

01:05:44.206 --> 01:05:46.574
I love you too.

01:05:47.710 --> 01:05:49.544
Good night.

01:06:34.623 --> 01:06:36.824
I won't do it.

01:06:38.660 --> 01:06:40.461
I won't hurt her.

01:06:43.065 --> 01:06:45.066
I said no!

01:07:41.590 --> 01:07:45.026
Oh, my god! Alex!

01:07:45.028 --> 01:07:47.929
Oh, my god, no!

01:07:47.931 --> 01:07:50.731
No! Alex, why?

01:07:50.733 --> 01:07:54.902
Oh, my god!
Oh, my god!

01:07:54.904 --> 01:07:56.337
Why? Why?

01:07:56.339 --> 01:07:58.339
Let go.
Let me put him down.

01:07:58.341 --> 01:08:00.107
He's all right.
He's all right.

01:08:00.109 --> 01:08:01.709
Breathe, breathe, that's it.

01:08:01.711 --> 01:08:03.277
Breathe.

01:08:09.518 --> 01:08:12.119
He's coming around.

01:08:12.121 --> 01:08:15.356
Hi, son.
Alex, hi, baby.

01:08:18.961 --> 01:08:20.161
We're here.

01:08:20.162 --> 01:08:21.729
Am I... am I dead?

01:08:21.731 --> 01:08:23.130
It's okay.
We're here with you.

01:08:23.131 --> 01:08:25.299
I'm supposed to be dead.
You're okay.

01:08:25.301 --> 01:08:27.902
- His pulse is good.
- Okay.

01:08:27.904 --> 01:08:29.504
Why did you save me?

01:08:29.506 --> 01:08:31.372
You're just
a little disoriented, Alex.

01:08:31.374 --> 01:08:34.075
You're gonna be fine.
You've been through a lot.

01:08:34.077 --> 01:08:36.109
Just rest.

01:08:37.212 --> 01:08:38.145
Where's my crucifix?

01:08:38.147 --> 01:08:40.281
Don't worry.
We have it.

01:08:40.283 --> 01:08:43.350
Give it to me.
I need it.

01:08:44.419 --> 01:08:45.586
Mom, give it to me.

01:08:45.587 --> 01:08:47.921
It's the only thing
protecting me.

01:08:47.924 --> 01:08:49.724
Okay, okay.

01:08:49.725 --> 01:08:52.693
Here. There you go.

01:08:54.395 --> 01:08:57.899
You and dad and Alicia...

01:08:58.966 --> 01:09:00.234
You're in danger.

01:09:00.236 --> 01:09:03.770
As long as I'm alive,
no one close to me is safe.

01:09:03.773 --> 01:09:07.707
Shh. We're okay, baby.
Everyone's okay.

01:09:07.710 --> 01:09:09.510
You don't understand.

01:09:10.078 --> 01:09:12.446
There's something after me.

01:09:13.649 --> 01:09:15.917
It's coming for all of us.

01:09:18.120 --> 01:09:20.488
What's coming for us?

01:09:21.990 --> 01:09:24.492
I... I can't tell you,

01:09:25.294 --> 01:09:28.662
but it won't stop
until it has me.

01:09:29.932 --> 01:09:31.832
Please believe me.

01:09:32.033 --> 01:09:33.200
Please, just believe me.

01:09:33.202 --> 01:09:36.002
Just let me die.
Just please let me die!

01:09:36.005 --> 01:09:36.904
No, honey.

01:09:36.906 --> 01:09:41.175
Honey, let go, let go.
You're hurting yourself. No.

01:09:41.176 --> 01:09:43.310
You're hurting yourself, son.
I'm trying to help you.

01:09:43.313 --> 01:09:44.946
Stop! No!
Just please let go.

01:09:44.948 --> 01:09:48.049
Get off of me! Mom, stop it!
Get off of me!

01:09:48.051 --> 01:09:50.751
Hold him down.
Mom, stop!

01:09:50.752 --> 01:09:52.420
Mom, let go of me!

01:09:52.421 --> 01:09:55.089
Mom, please stop!

01:09:55.091 --> 01:09:57.258
Mom! Mom, please!

01:09:57.260 --> 01:09:58.826
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

01:09:58.828 --> 01:10:02.196
All right, all right.
That's it. We're done.

01:10:02.198 --> 01:10:06.467
It's okay, baby.
It's okay.

01:10:07.836 --> 01:10:09.770
You're okay.

01:10:09.772 --> 01:10:12.139
Do you think
you can help our son?

01:10:12.141 --> 01:10:14.175
It's just that, um,
we're concerned

01:10:14.177 --> 01:10:15.509
that this might have
something to do

01:10:15.511 --> 01:10:17.812
with what happened to Alex
when he was a child.

01:10:17.814 --> 01:10:22.249
You refer to the molestation
by his grandfather.

01:10:22.251 --> 01:10:24.352
Yeah.

01:10:24.354 --> 01:10:26.420
I believe it does.

01:10:27.322 --> 01:10:29.090
His repressed memory
is very likely

01:10:29.092 --> 01:10:32.259
the cause of his recent issues.

01:10:32.694 --> 01:10:36.230
I knew we should have continued
these sessions 10 years ago,

01:10:36.232 --> 01:10:40.735
but my husband felt
that Alex was okay.

01:10:40.737 --> 01:10:42.637
Oh, please, Alex was fine.

01:10:42.639 --> 01:10:43.771
He was acting normal.

01:10:43.773 --> 01:10:45.473
I knew it was
the wrong decision.

01:10:45.475 --> 01:10:49.577
I think we need to focus on
what we can do for Alex now.

01:10:49.579 --> 01:10:51.345
I agree.

01:10:52.047 --> 01:10:52.713
Sorry.

01:10:52.715 --> 01:10:56.117
His past trauma
can no longer be ignored.

01:10:56.119 --> 01:11:01.122
It's time for him to face
his repressed memories.

01:11:55.444 --> 01:11:57.778
<i>How do you feel?</i>

01:11:59.414 --> 01:12:01.515
I feel good, father.

01:12:02.317 --> 01:12:06.587
See, Dr. Dian made me
understand that I have...

01:12:09.191 --> 01:12:10.858
Issues.

01:12:12.194 --> 01:12:16.597
Issues that I'll have to deal
with for the rest of my life.

01:12:17.632 --> 01:12:20.568
But I've come
to terms with that.

01:12:22.504 --> 01:12:25.039
The demon I was seeing?

01:12:26.708 --> 01:12:29.343
It never really existed.

01:12:31.079 --> 01:12:32.279
It was just my imagination,

01:12:32.281 --> 01:12:36.283
a subconscious way for me
to deal with the things

01:12:36.285 --> 01:12:39.887
that happened to me
when I was a little boy.

01:12:40.822 --> 01:12:43.390
It was just like you said.

01:12:43.825 --> 01:12:46.360
It was all in my head.

01:12:46.362 --> 01:12:50.264
What we experienced was real.

01:12:50.266 --> 01:12:51.766
You can't ignore it.

01:12:51.768 --> 01:12:54.235
If you do, it will destroy you.

01:12:54.237 --> 01:12:55.069
I should go.

01:12:55.071 --> 01:12:58.506
Alex, please,
you need to listen to me.

01:12:58.508 --> 01:13:00.407
In the darkest of times,
it becomes difficult

01:13:00.409 --> 01:13:03.577
to distinguish god
from the devil.

01:13:04.546 --> 01:13:06.247
Alex.

01:13:07.282 --> 01:13:08.582
Alex!

01:13:08.584 --> 01:13:11.118
<i>How are you two holding up?</i>

01:13:11.120 --> 01:13:12.486
Oh, we're pretty good.

01:13:12.488 --> 01:13:15.790
I'm... I'm tired.

01:13:16.158 --> 01:13:18.192
So tired.

01:13:18.194 --> 01:13:22.363
But I'm happy that Alex
is getting through this.

01:13:22.365 --> 01:13:23.631
He's been through so much.

01:13:23.633 --> 01:13:28.335
We just want to go back to being
a normal family again, you know?

01:13:28.970 --> 01:13:30.638
I wanna put this behind us.

01:13:30.640 --> 01:13:34.375
Marcos, this will always
be part of Alex

01:13:34.377 --> 01:13:36.811
for the rest of his life,

01:13:36.813 --> 01:13:40.080
but he's learned
how to live with it.

01:13:49.624 --> 01:13:52.960
Our father, who art in heaven,

01:13:52.962 --> 01:13:54.829
hallowed be thy name,

01:13:54.831 --> 01:13:58.165
thy kingdom come,
thy will be done

01:13:58.167 --> 01:13:59.333
on earth as it is in heaven.

01:13:59.335 --> 01:14:02.870
Give us this day our daily bread

01:14:02.872 --> 01:14:04.772
and forgive us our trespasses,

01:14:04.774 --> 01:14:07.741
as we forgive those
who trespassed against us,

01:14:07.743 --> 01:14:13.480
and lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us from evil.

01:14:14.015 --> 01:14:15.549
Amen.

01:14:48.917 --> 01:14:51.585
Hello and welcome.

01:14:51.587 --> 01:14:53.821
I want to thank my brother Alex,

01:14:53.823 --> 01:14:56.390
my father Marcos,
and my mother Lucia.

01:14:56.392 --> 01:15:00.527
Without all of you, this film
would not have been possible.

01:15:00.529 --> 01:15:05.900
Now sit back, relax,
and enjoy <i> the three dorks.</i>

01:15:05.902 --> 01:15:06.700
Roll 'em!

01:15:06.702 --> 01:15:09.536
You're a dork.
Here we go.

01:15:26.821 --> 01:15:28.722
Hold on, I think
we just blew a fuse.

01:15:28.724 --> 01:15:30.557
What about my movie?

01:15:30.559 --> 01:15:31.492
Don't worry.

01:15:31.494 --> 01:15:34.762
We'll watch it as soon as
the power comes back on.

01:15:37.265 --> 01:15:38.599
That's strange.

01:15:38.601 --> 01:15:41.535
We're the only ones
who lost power.

01:15:51.079 --> 01:15:53.614
Mom! Mom!

01:15:53.616 --> 01:15:55.749
Mom!

01:15:56.117 --> 01:15:59.353
Mom, get away from the window!

01:15:59.355 --> 01:16:00.921
Mom!

01:16:02.290 --> 01:16:04.024
Mommy!

01:16:12.600 --> 01:16:14.001
Hey!

01:16:15.838 --> 01:16:18.772
Dad!

01:16:23.712 --> 01:16:24.945
Marcos!

01:16:24.947 --> 01:16:28.248
Oh, my god! Oh, my god!
Honey, are you okay?

01:16:28.250 --> 01:16:30.084
Dad. Dad,
are you all right?

01:16:30.086 --> 01:16:32.286
He's just unconscious.

01:16:33.722 --> 01:16:35.689
Where's Alicia?

01:16:39.828 --> 01:16:41.228
Alicia!

01:16:46.668 --> 01:16:48.302
Alicia?

01:16:50.372 --> 01:16:52.172
Alicia?

01:16:53.975 --> 01:16:57.211
Baby, what are you doing?

01:17:03.853 --> 01:17:05.519
No!

01:17:05.754 --> 01:17:07.488
Alicia!

01:17:07.655 --> 01:17:10.424
No!

01:17:10.426 --> 01:17:12.626
No! Oh, my god!

01:17:12.628 --> 01:17:14.661
Alicia! Alicia, baby!

01:17:14.663 --> 01:17:17.164
Oh, my god!

01:17:17.298 --> 01:17:20.167
No! Please, no!

01:17:20.502 --> 01:17:23.370
Oh, my god! Stop!

01:17:28.443 --> 01:17:30.010
No!

01:17:39.487 --> 01:17:40.954
No.

01:17:48.831 --> 01:17:50.197
No.

01:17:50.199 --> 01:17:52.900
No, no, no!

01:17:52.902 --> 01:17:55.469
No, don't!

01:17:55.603 --> 01:17:57.037
Take me!

01:17:57.039 --> 01:17:59.339
I'm the one you want!

01:17:59.341 --> 01:18:02.042
You wanna take me, take me!

01:18:02.044 --> 01:18:03.644
Come on!

01:18:03.646 --> 01:18:05.612
You want me?

01:18:05.614 --> 01:18:07.281
Take me!

01:18:07.816 --> 01:18:10.050
Take me!

01:18:21.596 --> 01:18:23.197
Alicia?

01:18:25.601 --> 01:18:27.501
Honey, come here.
Alicia, come here.

01:18:31.573 --> 01:18:34.908
Oh, my god!

01:18:35.610 --> 01:18:38.545
I'm ready to die.

01:18:38.847 --> 01:18:40.280
No, no!

01:18:40.282 --> 01:18:41.415
O holy hosts above,

01:18:41.417 --> 01:18:43.750
I call upon thee as a
servant of Jesus Christ

01:18:43.752 --> 01:18:45.452
to sanctify this day
in preparation

01:18:45.454 --> 01:18:47.321
for the fulfillment
of the will of god.

01:18:47.323 --> 01:18:49.123
O lord, Jesus Christ,
most merciful,

01:18:49.125 --> 01:18:51.225
I ask you that you wrap
your arms around me

01:18:51.227 --> 01:18:52.459
that I might pass in safety.

01:18:52.461 --> 01:18:54.728
By this sign, I am absolved
of all past errors,

01:18:54.730 --> 01:18:57.564
free to take place in the world
that he has prepared for us,

01:18:57.566 --> 01:18:59.833
to dwell in the house
of the lord forever.

01:18:59.835 --> 01:19:01.635
O lord, Jesus Christ,
most merciful,

01:19:01.637 --> 01:19:03.504
I ask you that you wrap
your arms around me

01:19:03.506 --> 01:19:05.105
that I might pass
in safety through this.

01:19:05.107 --> 01:19:07.441
By this sign, I am absolved
from all past errors,

01:19:07.443 --> 01:19:10.344
free to take my place in the
world he has prepared for us,

01:19:10.346 --> 01:19:12.079
to dwell in the house
of the lord forever.

01:19:12.081 --> 01:19:13.881
O lord, Jesus Christ,
most merciful,

01:19:13.883 --> 01:19:16.016
I ask you that you wrap
your arms around me

01:19:16.018 --> 01:19:17.551
that I might pass
in safety from this.

01:19:17.553 --> 01:19:19.620
By this sign, I am absolved
of all past errors,

01:19:19.622 --> 01:19:22.990
and I am free to take my place in
the world he has prepared for us,

01:19:22.992 --> 01:19:25.759
to dwell in the house
of the lord forever.

01:19:32.768 --> 01:19:34.701
What happened?

01:19:36.771 --> 01:19:38.405
Alex!

01:19:42.644 --> 01:19:45.245
Mom? Dad?

01:19:47.615 --> 01:19:49.917
Honey.

01:19:52.820 --> 01:19:55.155
Mom!
Alex.

01:19:56.090 --> 01:19:59.860
<i>The devil is very real,</i>

01:20:00.228 --> 01:20:03.797
and he's here amongst us,
in our world,

01:20:03.799 --> 01:20:09.136
ever ready to strike,
ready to test our faith.

01:20:09.138 --> 01:20:13.040
It is our god-given birthright
to deny the evil one,

01:20:13.042 --> 01:20:16.210
to refuse to give him his power,

01:20:17.679 --> 01:20:22.082
to stand up with courage

01:20:22.617 --> 01:20:29.056
and the will to choose good
over evil in our actions.

01:20:33.628 --> 01:20:36.730
<i>Because in the end,</i>

01:20:37.932 --> 01:20:40.934
<i>we're stronger than the devil.</i>

01:20:42.937 --> 01:20:44.338
<i>It's true.</i>

01:20:44.340 --> 01:20:48.875
<i>He will use all he can
to weaken our resolve,</i>

01:20:49.210 --> 01:20:53.380
<i>but we must not be discouraged.</i>

01:20:53.848 --> 01:20:57.918
<i>We are stronger.</i>
