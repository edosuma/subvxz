00:53.800 --> 00:56.156
Look. Maya.

00:56.320 --> 00:57.879
You need to listen.

00:58.040 --> 01:01.238
I have a new target.

01:01.400 --> 01:02.800
You need to leave.

01:03.000 --> 01:06.277
Both of you.
You need to pack the car and get away.

01:07.080 --> 01:09.675
As far away from here as possible.

01:10.280 --> 01:14.069
All right, easy there, easy there.
Seriously, throttle back...

01:14.240 --> 01:16.880
...or I might get the impression
you're gonna miss me.

01:17.880 --> 01:20.031
I've been flying choppers for 40 years...

01:20.200 --> 01:23.432
...from Air America to Hudson Sky Tours,
and I gotta admit...

01:23.640 --> 01:25.472
...I hated every minute of it.

01:26.000 --> 01:28.674
Listening to Marty defending
his pathetic Cubs...

01:28.840 --> 01:29.876
Cubbies!

01:30.040 --> 01:32.714
The only reason I ever put up
with the guy was because...

01:32.880 --> 01:35.031
...he's the best damn mechanic
in the business.

01:38.200 --> 01:39.429
Grew up in Wrigleyville.

01:39.600 --> 01:41.398
I could say the same about all of you.

01:41.560 --> 01:43.472
It's been a pleasure working with you.

01:43.640 --> 01:45.632
If you ever get to Palm Desert, please...

01:45.800 --> 01:48.235
...promise me you won't call.

01:48.760 --> 01:51.036
- Cheers!
- Cheers.

02:00.280 --> 02:02.431
Wrigleyville. How you know Warren?

02:02.640 --> 02:05.360
Charter service.
Shuttling the 1 percent.

02:05.560 --> 02:08.711
- I'm a mechanic too.
- Can't fly without us.

02:21.000 --> 02:22.753
Hold on.

02:23.640 --> 02:24.869
Won't be long.

03:04.440 --> 03:08.036
<i>Hello, Masha. I know it's late,
but I wanted to speak to you alone.</i>

03:08.200 --> 03:10.237
<i>- Where is she?
- I never wanted you to be apart.</i>

03:10.400 --> 03:11.516
Where's my daughter?

03:11.680 --> 03:13.797
<i>Right here. Safe.</i>

03:22.840 --> 03:26.231
If you so much as... If you hurt her...

03:26.880 --> 03:28.234
I know the truth.

03:28.400 --> 03:32.189
<i>The only reason you came for me,
the only reason you want Agnes...</i>

03:32.360 --> 03:34.477
<i>...is because of what's killing you.</i>

03:34.640 --> 03:36.518
<i>It's a genetic disease...</i>

03:36.680 --> 03:38.080
<i>...and you think we can...</i>

03:38.840 --> 03:40.399
...cure you, that our blood can...

03:40.840 --> 03:44.629
<i>Yes. The blood is what I need,
but it's not what I want.</i>

03:44.800 --> 03:46.359
<i>What I want is to be together...</i>

03:46.520 --> 03:49.399
...but that can't happen
until Reddington's out of your life.

03:49.560 --> 03:51.233
Only you can make that happen.

03:51.400 --> 03:53.517
I see you're wearing
your mother's bracelet.

03:54.760 --> 03:56.592
I'm glad.

03:56.760 --> 03:59.070
I want you to know
that your baby is safe.

03:59.240 --> 04:01.118
This link is open day or night...

04:01.280 --> 04:03.272
...any time you want to see Agnes.

04:08.840 --> 04:11.514
Hi, baby.

04:12.120 --> 04:14.157
What do you mean,
you don't want to trace the link?

04:14.320 --> 04:16.039
You don't think he's thought of that?

04:16.200 --> 04:19.875
The second he discovers we traced it,
he'll take it away. Take her away.

04:20.040 --> 04:22.999
The only way we'll get her
is by finding where it's coming from.

04:23.200 --> 04:27.160
- I don't think he'll hurt her.
- He will. She's his last chance of survival.

04:27.320 --> 04:29.551
- If he hurts her, he loses me.
- Yeah. And lives.

04:29.960 --> 04:33.237
What does Kirk want more
than anything in the world?

04:33.560 --> 04:35.074
For me to trust him.

04:35.240 --> 04:37.118
To care for him.

04:37.280 --> 04:41.240
And because it's what he desires most,
it's the easiest way to deceive him.

04:41.640 --> 04:44.200
He'll see what he wants to see,
my affection.

04:44.360 --> 04:47.956
He won't see what's real, my deception.

04:48.760 --> 04:53.516
This link is an opportunity
for me to get close to Kirk...

04:54.120 --> 04:56.510
...and I can't do anything
to jeopardize that.

04:56.680 --> 04:59.593
- Liz, I think you're being naÃ¯ve.
- I know you think that...

05:00.200 --> 05:02.954
...and I'm asking you to trust me.

05:07.880 --> 05:09.599
Dembe said you had a lead on Agnes?

05:09.760 --> 05:10.955
Some years ago...

05:11.160 --> 05:14.551
...I had a rather awkward encounter
with a bull shark...

05:14.720 --> 05:17.599
...while diving off the Great Barrier Reef.

05:17.760 --> 05:20.514
I actually think it was trying
to be affectionate...

05:20.680 --> 05:23.115
...even a little forward.

05:23.280 --> 05:26.352
The net result was excruciating.

05:26.520 --> 05:29.035
But I did spend a glorious month...

05:29.200 --> 05:33.752
...submitting to the healing hands
of an utterly divine lighthouse keeper...

05:33.920 --> 05:35.149
...on Bramble Cay...

05:35.320 --> 05:38.233
...a low-lying island
that's rapidly being submerged...

05:38.440 --> 05:41.399
...by rising sea levels
due to climate change.

05:42.160 --> 05:43.310
Climate change?

05:43.840 --> 05:46.992
Our next Blacklister is devoted
to protecting the Earth...

05:47.200 --> 05:51.752
...from the greatest threat
to its existence as we know it: Us.

05:51.920 --> 05:56.073
He's a stealth eco-terrorist
known only as Gaia...

05:56.240 --> 05:58.152
..."Earth Mother" in Greek mythology.

05:58.320 --> 06:03.475
Okay, so the connection between
this Earth Mother and Agnes is what?

06:03.640 --> 06:07.236
What is not relevant. Only where.

06:07.400 --> 06:10.871
We must find this man.
Unless you have a better lead on Kirk.

06:11.040 --> 06:13.874
- Has he reached out to you?
- No, he hasn't.

06:14.680 --> 06:18.310
- Gaia, then.
- A stealth eco-terrorist?

06:18.520 --> 06:19.715
Isn't that an oxymoron?

06:19.880 --> 06:22.998
Nine times out of 10, the public
reacts to an act of eco-terror...

06:23.160 --> 06:24.992
...by getting angry at the terrorist...

06:25.160 --> 06:28.517
...rather than the environmental offense
he seeks to draw attention to.

06:28.680 --> 06:31.752
By disguising his sabotage
in "accidents"...

06:31.920 --> 06:36.199
...Gaia succeeds in focusing
the public's rage on the actual danger...

06:36.360 --> 06:39.512
...not the criminal who exposes it.

06:39.680 --> 06:41.797
Shall I go on?

06:42.000 --> 06:46.597
2011. Ten thousand gallons of MCHM,
a toxic chemical used to wash coal...

06:46.800 --> 06:49.190
...was leaked
from the Fullerton Chemical Plant.

06:49.360 --> 06:52.637
Now, this spill made it
into the drinking water in the local towns.

06:52.800 --> 06:54.154
A few hundred were poisoned...

06:54.320 --> 06:57.279
...including two children
and three elderly victims who died.

06:57.440 --> 07:00.911
Environmentalists had warned
of the danger of a spill for years...

07:01.080 --> 07:03.549
...but no one listened until this leak.

07:03.720 --> 07:05.677
And then the EPA
finally mandated changes.

07:05.840 --> 07:06.876
So it worked.

07:07.040 --> 07:08.759
In Gaia's mind, he protected people.

07:08.920 --> 07:11.310
Well, tell that to the parents
who lost their kids.

07:11.480 --> 07:14.314
He kills innocents to make a point
that people are in danger.

07:14.480 --> 07:16.949
How does taking him down
get us closer to Kirk?

07:17.160 --> 07:18.196
Reddington won't say.

07:18.360 --> 07:21.034
Even though this is allegedly
about finding your daughter.

07:21.200 --> 07:23.510
- What a prick.
- I want this guy found.

07:23.680 --> 07:25.637
Go over every detail of that spill.

07:25.840 --> 07:28.992
If it was sabotage, Gaia left a trail.
Find it.

07:30.720 --> 07:32.040
Hey.

07:32.200 --> 07:37.195
So about last night, sorry we couldn't talk.
But if you wanna grab lunch and chat...

07:37.360 --> 07:39.556
- It's okay, I figured it out.
- Figured what out?

07:39.720 --> 07:42.235
Whether or not to submit
my transfer request.

07:42.440 --> 07:44.909
I decided I should. So I did.

07:45.080 --> 07:46.639
So it's official?

07:47.920 --> 07:49.718
I knew you were thinking about it...

07:49.880 --> 07:51.473
- ...but you...
- It's not a big deal.

07:51.640 --> 07:53.359
- It's for the best.
- Right.

07:53.520 --> 07:57.434
Sure. That is...
You've given it a lot of thought, so...

07:59.440 --> 08:00.874
Congratulations.

08:02.400 --> 08:04.790
I shouldn't keep Ressler waiting.

08:10.600 --> 08:13.798
This is crazy. A team
of Chemical Safety Board investigators...

08:13.960 --> 08:17.112
...looked into this after the spill.
Nothing was flagged.

08:17.280 --> 08:19.954
This is box seven.
There are 43 more evidence boxes.

08:22.520 --> 08:25.399
- Googled Aram's new girlfriend.
- Why?

08:25.560 --> 08:28.712
Why do guys do anything?
To see if she was hot. Which she is.

08:30.480 --> 08:31.800
I thought we had everything.

08:31.960 --> 08:34.679
Everything from CSB.
These are from the internal investigation.

08:35.240 --> 08:37.960
You're wasting your time.
That spill was an accident.

08:38.159 --> 08:39.389
Two days before the leak...

08:39.559 --> 08:42.200
...a veteran DEP inspector
looked over the storage tanks.

08:42.360 --> 08:45.080
He didn't see anything wrong,
neither did the guy two weeks earlier.

08:45.240 --> 08:48.517
What other guy? I looked at the list
of scheduled inspections.

08:48.680 --> 08:51.320
- There was only one in the month prior.
- Scheduled, yeah.

08:51.480 --> 08:53.199
But we get spot inspections.

08:53.360 --> 08:57.036
We're gonna need everything
you have on that spot inspector now.

09:00.960 --> 09:03.873
Borron Energy Services.

09:04.040 --> 09:05.440
That's fracking, right?

09:05.600 --> 09:07.831
Well, I'm a field inspector.

09:08.280 --> 09:10.476
That's bad stuff, man.

09:10.640 --> 09:13.951
Fracking. Messing up the water table.

09:14.120 --> 09:17.352
There's places you can light a fire
with what's coming out of the tap.

09:17.840 --> 09:19.399
You're making people sick.

09:19.560 --> 09:21.756
You wanna know
what's in your sweetener?

09:21.920 --> 09:23.639
Chemicals in that creamer?

09:23.800 --> 09:25.951
What about the plastic bottles
in that cooler?

09:26.960 --> 09:28.155
Look around.

09:28.320 --> 09:29.800
Everything's killing us.

09:30.000 --> 09:34.199
So spare me the guilt trip
and the righteous lecture.

09:35.160 --> 09:36.310
I earn my living...

09:37.000 --> 09:38.559
...same as you.

10:02.200 --> 10:03.759
You're right.

10:04.640 --> 10:08.554
This world is just filled
with things that are gonna kill us.

10:47.320 --> 10:50.552
Okay, ladies and gentlemen,
I think we have a suspect.

10:50.720 --> 10:51.756
Okay, check this out.

10:51.960 --> 10:54.156
The Kentucky chemical plant
wasn't the only facility...

10:54.320 --> 10:56.471
...that received a visit
from a spot inspector.

10:56.640 --> 10:59.314
Three other "accident" sites
received spot inspections...

10:59.480 --> 11:02.712
- ...within a few weeks of their failing.
- So that's this guy's MO.

11:02.880 --> 11:05.554
He's not breaking in,
he's walking through the front door.

11:05.720 --> 11:08.155
- You said you had a suspect.
- Right.

11:08.720 --> 11:11.280
I got surveillance video
from three of the facilities...

11:11.480 --> 11:13.995
...on this particular spot inspector.

11:16.480 --> 11:19.359
- That's our guy.
- Alert DHS and circulate the photo.

11:19.520 --> 11:20.874
Put a name to that face.

11:23.160 --> 11:24.560
Hey.

11:24.720 --> 11:26.313
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

11:26.480 --> 11:29.552
Because Aram told me
you put in for a transfer.

11:30.080 --> 11:31.196
Navabi, trust me...

11:31.360 --> 11:33.875
...I get how angry you are at Keen
for what she did...

11:34.040 --> 11:38.080
Yes. That is part of why I'm leaving,
but it's not just that.

11:38.600 --> 11:40.114
It's this place.

11:40.280 --> 11:42.556
You never know where you stand
with anyone.

11:42.760 --> 11:44.752
If they'll be there when you need them.

11:44.920 --> 11:48.357
If there's anything that I can do
to get you to reconsider, let me know.

11:48.560 --> 11:51.075
I'll do it. You're a good partner.

11:51.600 --> 11:53.432
I wish there was.

11:53.600 --> 11:55.034
I really do.

12:03.480 --> 12:06.791
- Six months?
- Maybe. Maybe less.

12:07.240 --> 12:09.038
But we both knew
this day was coming...

12:09.440 --> 12:11.716
...when your body would
start rejecting transfusions.

12:11.880 --> 12:14.076
It's remarkable it's lasted this long.

12:14.240 --> 12:17.153
- There is a solution.
- We've already discussed this.

12:17.600 --> 12:19.512
- It's unacceptable.
- Easy for you to say.

12:19.680 --> 12:22.240
- You're not the one that's gonna die.
- No, I am.

12:22.400 --> 12:26.235
- And I agree with Sebastian.
- The girl is your only option.

12:26.400 --> 12:28.471
- We're exploring other cures.
- We were.

12:28.680 --> 12:30.797
Before we lost the Ribowski virus.

12:30.960 --> 12:33.350
Before the U.S. government
froze your assets.

12:33.560 --> 12:37.520
If the girl is a genetic match,
and there's no guarantee that she is...

12:37.680 --> 12:39.990
...extracting stem cells
from such a young child...

12:40.160 --> 12:42.356
...is extremely dangerous
and could prove fatal.

12:42.520 --> 12:44.716
Hippocrates bounds the doc
to do no harm.

12:44.880 --> 12:47.873
He's giving you "coulds." "Mights."

12:48.480 --> 12:50.711
I am under no such obligation.

12:50.880 --> 12:52.758
I am giving you facts.

12:53.320 --> 12:57.280
We are out of time
and we are out of resources.

12:58.400 --> 13:00.471
The only way to save your life...

13:01.560 --> 13:04.632
...is if we put that child's in jeopardy.

13:07.240 --> 13:08.879
I think we've got something.

13:09.040 --> 13:11.794
We put out an alert
to government and private facilities.

13:11.960 --> 13:13.917
- Oil and gas, chemical plants.
- And?

13:14.080 --> 13:17.676
A gas pipeline inspector in Newark
was found dead in his car this morning.

13:17.840 --> 13:19.399
- Heart attack.
- Could be coincidence.

13:19.560 --> 13:23.679
Maybe, but he had an appointment
to evaluate a gas pipeline in Westchester.

13:23.840 --> 13:25.559
- He's there.
- Was there a positive ID?

13:25.720 --> 13:27.996
- No, but...
- So it's a supposition.

13:28.200 --> 13:29.429
No, actually.

13:29.600 --> 13:33.196
According to security at the facility,
a guy showed up less than an hour ago...

13:33.360 --> 13:34.999
...claiming to be filling in
for the inspector.

13:35.160 --> 13:38.312
Ressler, Navabi, get there.
Keen, call the plant manager and sheriff.

13:38.480 --> 13:42.190
See if they can evacuate the area
without tipping off Gaia that we're coming.

13:46.360 --> 13:48.272
- Agents Navabi, Ressler. Where is he?
- Sector 7.

13:48.440 --> 13:50.796
Said he had to check
the pressure gauges.

14:18.080 --> 14:19.594
Stop! Federal agent!

14:34.600 --> 14:36.080
He's got a gun!

14:36.240 --> 14:37.799
Ressler!

15:24.920 --> 15:26.513
Step out of the vehicle!

15:27.320 --> 15:28.640
Let's see your hands!

15:36.800 --> 15:37.836
Damnit.

15:44.600 --> 15:47.638
Long time, Martell.
Or whatever you're calling yourself now.

15:47.840 --> 15:49.069
Martell will be fine.

15:50.280 --> 15:52.954
- You?
- There's a bunch to choose from.

15:53.120 --> 15:58.115
England, France, Malta,
your basic NATO alliance.

15:59.200 --> 16:01.635
Malta's not in NATO.

16:02.600 --> 16:04.319
Always were a stickler.

16:04.520 --> 16:06.512
Why don't we just stick with Krantz?

16:08.040 --> 16:10.760
So, what's on your mind, Martell?

16:10.920 --> 16:13.799
I got a job for you and your crew.

16:13.960 --> 16:17.237
Digital trace. Break-in.

16:18.080 --> 16:19.799
I'm all ears.

16:23.960 --> 16:26.350
The pipeline targeted by Gaia
carries fracked gas...

16:26.520 --> 16:28.876
...a process
that environmentalists oppose.

16:29.040 --> 16:32.238
Why? Because fracking creates jobs
and energy independence?

16:32.640 --> 16:35.519
Maybe. Or maybe because of this.

16:35.720 --> 16:37.439
San Bruno, 2010.

16:37.640 --> 16:41.270
A ruptured natural gas pipeline
caused a 72-foot-long crater...

16:41.440 --> 16:42.715
...and killed eight people.

16:42.880 --> 16:46.476
Last year in Allentown, another exploded
under the city street, killing five.

16:46.640 --> 16:47.676
It fits the MO.

16:47.840 --> 16:49.513
He was gonna cause an accident
to provoke public outrage.

16:49.680 --> 16:52.354
Yeah, but how?
We didn't find any explosives.

16:52.520 --> 16:54.193
- What was he doing?
- Research.

16:54.360 --> 16:57.319
Look where Gaia's tools
and fake ID badge were found.

16:57.480 --> 16:59.472
At the spot
with the highest gas pressure.

16:59.640 --> 17:03.270
He was trying to identify the most
vulnerable point, the perfect place to hit.

17:03.440 --> 17:06.114
If it's that dangerous,
why hasn't it been shut down?

17:06.280 --> 17:08.317
There are safety rules
for new pipelines...

17:08.480 --> 17:11.040
...but they don't always apply
for existing lines.

17:11.200 --> 17:13.031
Probably the point he's trying to make.

17:13.200 --> 17:14.998
It gets worse, actually.

17:15.160 --> 17:17.755
An expert over at PHMSA
did a blast radius projection...

17:17.920 --> 17:21.630
...just to see what kind of damage
an explosion at this spot would cause.

17:21.800 --> 17:23.154
In an urban area like this...

17:23.319 --> 17:27.233
...we're talking hundreds of homes,
schools, a city hospital...

17:27.440 --> 17:30.035
...and this: Stone Park.

17:30.200 --> 17:33.432
The largest nuclear power plant
on the U.S. Eastern Seaboard.

17:33.600 --> 17:35.671
Where are we on the fake badge
you recovered?

17:35.840 --> 17:38.719
Nowhere. Reddington's got a guy
who might be able to help.

17:38.880 --> 17:40.837
Reddington's guy...

17:41.000 --> 17:42.354
...who is he?

17:47.160 --> 17:49.720
Forgive the intrusion, keglers.

17:51.640 --> 17:53.871
- What do you want?
- I have a job for you, Glen.

17:54.040 --> 17:55.076
News flash:

17:55.240 --> 17:58.278
- I'm off the clock, Reddington.
- It's a matter of some urgency.

17:58.440 --> 18:02.195
No, it's a matter of some me time.
Boundaries. Work-life balance.

18:02.360 --> 18:07.230
- The pause that refreshes.
- We need to know who made this ID.

18:07.440 --> 18:09.159
Your release point is off.

18:09.320 --> 18:12.677
But I'm a charming conversationalist,
so the ladies don't mind.

18:12.840 --> 18:14.274
Keep your elbows in.

18:16.800 --> 18:20.350
Some haste would be appreciated.
A child's life is in the balance.

18:20.520 --> 18:23.319
Hologram. RFID chip.

18:23.480 --> 18:26.632
Ji Ming's your man. Chinese ex-pat.

18:26.800 --> 18:28.712
Loves all things Americano.

18:28.920 --> 18:31.719
Last time we had dinner,
he ordered bull fries.

18:31.920 --> 18:36.039
You ever had bull...?
Ji Ming! Jellybean here.

18:36.200 --> 18:38.476
...that's what I'm saying.
There was no address.

18:38.640 --> 18:41.792
He was way out in the woods.
Allegheny County.

18:41.960 --> 18:44.077
All I need is an address, Glen.

18:44.240 --> 18:46.516
Off 687. South of Falling Spring.

18:46.680 --> 18:48.273
Mile off the road there's a path.

18:48.480 --> 18:50.915
Hold on. You're gonna need
to write this down.

18:51.080 --> 18:52.196
- Glen. An address.
- Hey!

18:52.400 --> 18:55.711
I don't see you jumping in here, pal.
I'm doing the best I can.

18:55.880 --> 18:58.714
A night course in Mandarin
doesn't get past reading menus...

18:58.880 --> 19:01.714
...and "Honey, your caboose
looks tasty in those slacks."

19:01.880 --> 19:03.837
There was a trail.
You turn at a tree.

19:04.320 --> 19:06.596
An old oak tree.

19:06.760 --> 19:08.274
What the hell's he saying?

19:08.440 --> 19:10.591
Honestly?
He says he doesn't like you.

19:10.760 --> 19:14.310
Says you look like his third wife
and that, what?

19:14.480 --> 19:19.271
Right, that you have no appreciation
for the fact that bowling is like sex.

19:19.440 --> 19:20.715
It's about rhythm and flow.

19:21.120 --> 19:24.318
You can't stop in the middle and go back
to pick up the spare you missed...

19:24.480 --> 19:27.439
...because some jerk shouted out
during the middle of your roll.

19:27.640 --> 19:29.597
He's already given you the address.

19:29.760 --> 19:32.753
Yeah. But it's a little off the grid.

19:32.920 --> 19:34.559
I'd ditch the wingtips.

19:34.720 --> 19:36.393
Dembe, call Elizabeth.

20:11.080 --> 20:13.037
What do you see?

20:13.600 --> 20:15.000
He's withdrawn, a loner...

20:15.160 --> 20:19.677
...and yet he's committed
to making the world a cleaner place.

20:24.440 --> 20:27.000
Photo of a pregnant woman...

20:28.240 --> 20:30.232
...but no child.

20:32.840 --> 20:35.878
Maybe the child was taken, or...

20:36.880 --> 20:38.678
Or died.

20:39.320 --> 20:41.960
We're going to get her back, Lizzy.

20:50.880 --> 20:52.951
Tidal charts for the Hudson.

20:55.200 --> 20:57.192
Stone Park is on the Hudson.

20:59.400 --> 21:00.629
Leave or I'll call the police.

21:00.800 --> 21:03.759
I'm only here because you didn't
return my calls. It's not safe.

21:03.920 --> 21:07.914
- You're violating the restraining order...
- I'm the least of your problems. Leave.

21:08.120 --> 21:09.554
Your mother's isn't far enough.

21:09.720 --> 21:11.837
- What are you planning?
- You need to leave the state.

21:20.640 --> 21:22.313
Hey, Sky.

21:23.040 --> 21:24.599
How's my little man?

21:26.960 --> 21:29.316
You're going on a car trip with Mommy.

21:29.960 --> 21:31.553
Someplace pretty.

21:31.720 --> 21:35.031
With trees turning all kinds of colors.

21:35.880 --> 21:37.872
Won't that be nice?

21:47.280 --> 21:48.999
You need to get on the road.

21:49.600 --> 21:51.239
Now.

21:58.600 --> 21:59.636
Hey there.

22:22.520 --> 22:25.080
What happened out there, young lady?

22:25.520 --> 22:27.591
You're not dressed for the woods.

22:28.960 --> 22:30.679
Can you talk?

22:31.440 --> 22:32.669
Well, that's all right.

22:33.080 --> 22:36.312
You don't need to say nothing.
We gotta get you fed.

22:36.680 --> 22:38.558
Build your strength up.

22:39.000 --> 22:41.196
Plenty of time to talk later.

23:07.800 --> 23:10.190
<i>- Hey.
- I'm looking at our little girl.</i>

23:10.680 --> 23:14.071
It's almost like a baby monitor,
like she's in the next room.

23:14.240 --> 23:16.072
Only she's not. Kirk has her.

23:16.240 --> 23:17.390
<i>I know.</i>

23:17.560 --> 23:20.997
I asked you this morning to trust me,
not to trace the link.

23:21.160 --> 23:23.311
<i>I want you to know
it means everything to me...</i>

23:23.480 --> 23:24.960
<i>...that you are okay with that.</i>

23:25.120 --> 23:27.635
<i>- Thank you.
- Everything's gonna be all right, Liz.</i>

23:28.120 --> 23:29.759
Blow her a kiss for me.

23:30.200 --> 23:31.429
Okay.

23:32.720 --> 23:35.076
- I love you.
- I love you too.

23:36.280 --> 23:37.316
I know you.

23:38.240 --> 23:40.755
It's your daughter,
you're gonna wanna be first one in.

23:40.920 --> 23:42.479
Let us take the lead.

23:42.640 --> 23:46.031
No use rescuing your daughter
if Daddy winds up dead.

23:46.200 --> 23:48.920
- Your guys are sure about this?
- We traced the server.

23:49.080 --> 23:51.879
This island, that house.

23:53.240 --> 23:55.038
Your baby's inside.

23:57.480 --> 23:58.516
Let's do it.

24:39.520 --> 24:41.034
<i>I'm disappointed in you.</i>

24:41.200 --> 24:43.271
- Don't...
- I thought we had an understanding.

24:43.440 --> 24:45.671
- What are you talking about?
- You traced this feed.

24:45.880 --> 24:46.950
No, I didn't.

24:47.120 --> 24:48.713
<i>There must be some mistake.</i>

24:52.320 --> 24:55.199
Wait. That had nothing to do with me.

24:55.360 --> 24:57.238
<i>- I'm sorry, Masha.
- No, I told Tom.</i>

24:57.400 --> 24:59.392
I specifically said...

24:59.600 --> 25:01.512
No! Please bring her back.

25:01.680 --> 25:03.672
I'm begging you, bring her back!

25:05.240 --> 25:07.436
Okay, sweetheart.
We gotta get you upright.

25:08.160 --> 25:10.038
You've been down too long.

25:10.200 --> 25:13.034
I'm gonna put my hand
behind your neck, just like a dance.

25:13.960 --> 25:15.030
Here we go.

25:15.240 --> 25:17.391
Nice and easy. One.

25:18.040 --> 25:19.440
Two.

25:20.600 --> 25:21.920
Okay. There we go.

25:24.120 --> 25:26.032
No big thing.

25:26.920 --> 25:29.276
You got a lot of grit
for such a little girl.

25:34.240 --> 25:36.118
You hungry?

25:42.600 --> 25:44.671
Do you understand me?

25:46.800 --> 25:48.871
Can you nod?

25:49.800 --> 25:51.473
That's good.

25:55.600 --> 25:58.240
You in some kind of trouble,
sweetheart?

26:02.720 --> 26:04.632
The men that did this...

26:07.400 --> 26:10.359
...they coming back for you?

26:18.240 --> 26:19.913
What is it?

26:21.600 --> 26:23.831
What are you trying to say?

26:25.240 --> 26:26.720
Thank you.

26:33.440 --> 26:36.433
- I'm not into pregnant chicks.
- I need you to find her.

26:36.600 --> 26:39.274
Are you a comedian?
Here once a night, twice on Sunday?

26:39.920 --> 26:42.674
- I already bailed you out.
- I need you to find this woman...

26:42.840 --> 26:46.754
- ...and her child, if there is one.
- You don't get it. We lost.

26:46.920 --> 26:50.675
This tournament's a bitch to get into.
We made it here, this close...

26:50.840 --> 26:53.150
...and we lost because of me.

26:53.320 --> 26:55.073
Because I missed a baby split.

26:55.680 --> 26:57.717
I don't understand bowling.

26:57.880 --> 26:59.837
Of course you don't.

27:01.360 --> 27:03.352
I'm sorry, Glen.

27:03.520 --> 27:04.749
I'm sorry.

27:07.360 --> 27:09.750
Come on, I'm squeezing your cheese!

27:09.920 --> 27:12.833
Thanks to your better half,
we swept the tourney.

27:13.000 --> 27:16.880
Elbow in,
release point sweet as a sister's kiss.

27:17.040 --> 27:19.874
You're talking to the team captain
of the newly-crowned...

27:20.040 --> 27:22.430
...Mid-Atlantic Champs!

27:22.600 --> 27:23.750
This preggo chick...

27:24.200 --> 27:26.032
...tell me about her.

27:26.200 --> 27:28.795
I'm feeling good!

27:29.000 --> 27:31.595
<i>I'm not here now. Leave a message
and I'll call you back.</i>

27:39.600 --> 27:41.478
Tom? What the hell did you...?

27:41.680 --> 27:44.912
No, no, no. Excuse me, doctor.

27:45.080 --> 27:47.117
I was just... It doesn't matter.

27:47.280 --> 27:48.919
The tidal charts.

27:49.080 --> 27:51.037
Were you able to review them?

27:51.200 --> 27:53.715
Owen Ayers, former officer in the Navy.

27:53.880 --> 27:56.076
Found his name on receipts
from Gaia's trailer.

27:56.240 --> 27:59.916
Ayers was a helicopter pilot,
before that an enlisted aircraft mechanic.

28:00.080 --> 28:03.039
Three tours in Iraq. Decorated.
This guy's a war hero.

28:03.240 --> 28:05.152
Medical discharge in 2012...

28:05.320 --> 28:07.710
...after participating
in Operation Meltdown.

28:07.880 --> 28:10.031
The U.S. military relief effort
in Mauritania.

28:10.200 --> 28:13.830
Flew into an unscheduled
emergency venting of radioactive gas.

28:14.040 --> 28:15.872
He and his crew
got radiation poisoning.

28:16.040 --> 28:18.794
He was the victim of a meltdown.
Now he wants to cause one.

28:19.280 --> 28:22.751
It's worse than we thought.
The tidal charts, can you pull them up?

28:23.360 --> 28:25.477
He wasn't just tracking tides
on the Hudson.

28:25.680 --> 28:28.275
He was calculating the exact time
of the super moon.

28:28.440 --> 28:31.877
- It happens only every couple decades...
- Causing unusually high and low tides.

28:32.040 --> 28:35.477
These charts identify exactly when
the Hudson will be at its lowest.

28:35.640 --> 28:37.472
Stone Park sits on the Hudson.

28:37.640 --> 28:40.439
They cool their reactors
by drawing water from the river.

28:40.600 --> 28:42.319
Over two billion gallons per day.

28:42.480 --> 28:44.676
We know an explosion in the pipeline...

28:44.840 --> 28:46.752
...will damage the reactor at Stone Park.

28:46.920 --> 28:48.400
What if, on top of that...

28:48.560 --> 28:50.631
...the reactor couldn't get enough water
to cool the core?

28:50.800 --> 28:53.360
Ayers wasn't trying to send a message
about the danger of nuclear power.

28:53.520 --> 28:57.150
- He's trying to recreate Mauritania.
- How? The pipeline's in lockdown.

28:57.320 --> 28:58.470
He can't get close.

28:58.640 --> 29:00.359
From the ground anyway.

29:00.520 --> 29:02.239
Hudson Sky Tours.

29:02.400 --> 29:04.039
This brochure was in his trailer.

29:04.200 --> 29:06.157
He knows the maintenance
and flight schedules.

29:06.320 --> 29:07.720
Do they operate in that area?

29:07.880 --> 29:09.758
Guys, look at this.

29:09.920 --> 29:11.752
Martin Powell, one of their mechanics...

29:11.920 --> 29:13.991
...had a heart attack in a bar
a few days ago.

29:14.160 --> 29:18.040
- How long before the tides are lowest?
- Any time within the next hour and a half.

29:18.200 --> 29:20.715
Get me Homeland. Keen, notify NRC.

29:20.880 --> 29:23.395
Aram, have security at the pipeline
and Stone Park...

29:23.560 --> 29:27.474
...and make sure the N.Y.P.D.
and Harbor Patrol get everybody out.

29:27.640 --> 29:29.199
Call the tour company
and get out there.

29:29.360 --> 29:32.034
Make sure Ayers never gets a chopper
off the ground.

29:32.760 --> 29:34.956
Arnie Gelber.
Here to cooperate any way I can.

29:35.120 --> 29:37.316
- What's the status of your fleet?
- We're secure.

29:37.480 --> 29:40.359
Only got three choppers.
Two are in the air with my best pilots.

29:40.520 --> 29:42.671
One's on a 30,
the other's on a full hour tour.

29:42.880 --> 29:44.553
- What about the third?
- Grounded.

29:44.760 --> 29:46.717
Had to cancel half a dozen trips today.

29:46.880 --> 29:48.394
Smack in the heart of the season.

29:48.560 --> 29:50.313
The third chopper. Where is it now?

29:50.480 --> 29:51.800
Being repaired.

29:51.960 --> 29:54.270
One of my mechanics
passed away a few nights ago.

29:54.480 --> 29:55.960
We're all dealing with the loss.

29:56.120 --> 29:59.079
- I got a new man working on it now.
- We need to talk to him now.

30:01.600 --> 30:02.795
What the hell?

30:33.400 --> 30:36.632
<i>Sky Three, please respond. Sky Three.</i>

30:36.800 --> 30:38.120
- Please respond.
- Owen Ayers.

30:38.280 --> 30:42.433
This is Special Agent Ressler of the FBI
ordering you to return to home base.

30:43.600 --> 30:45.114
Mr. Ayers, this is FBI Agent...

30:45.320 --> 30:48.040
I heard you the first time.
I won't be doing that.

30:48.600 --> 30:52.116
Alert the White House and the FAA
to authorize an intercept.

30:52.280 --> 30:55.193
We will shoot you down
if you do not return immediately.

30:56.240 --> 31:00.519
You can't scramble fighters fast enough.
I've gamed this out to the last detail.

31:01.040 --> 31:04.158
Give me some credit,
Agent Ressler of the FBI.

31:04.320 --> 31:05.993
How long
before he reaches the pipeline?

31:06.160 --> 31:08.356
Two minutes. Maybe less.

31:08.520 --> 31:11.877
If your next bright idea is
to have them shut the pipeline down...

31:12.040 --> 31:15.112
...sorry, that takes three whole days.

31:15.280 --> 31:18.671
Notify local authorities to immediately
activate evacuation protocols.

31:18.840 --> 31:20.194
Aram, we need options.

31:20.840 --> 31:23.514
I can try
and hack into the on board avionics...

31:23.680 --> 31:25.433
...try and take control.

31:31.800 --> 31:32.916
Don't do this.

31:33.120 --> 31:35.510
- Someone has to.
- There are other ways.

31:35.920 --> 31:39.391
<i>What? Protests? Hearings?
They've had them.</i>

31:39.560 --> 31:40.880
No one listens.

31:41.080 --> 31:42.196
<i>They'll listen to this.</i>

31:42.360 --> 31:43.714
Aram.

31:43.920 --> 31:46.196
No luck.
I can't access the AFCS directly...

31:46.360 --> 31:49.194
...and even if I could,
there's an automatic fail-safe.

31:49.360 --> 31:52.671
You can't go through with this.
Millions of innocent people will die.

31:52.840 --> 31:54.832
<i>Now, that's an interesting formulation.</i>

31:55.000 --> 31:56.400
"Innocent people."

31:56.600 --> 31:57.716
<i>Innocent of what?</i>

31:57.880 --> 32:01.078
<i>Of wanting their houses warmed,
their cars fueled...</i>

32:01.240 --> 32:06.599
...with no regard for how any of that
fouls our air, our water, our planet?

32:06.760 --> 32:10.993
<i>I'm a dead man walking,
thanks to nuclear power.</i>

32:11.160 --> 32:14.631
It poisoned my innocent, unborn son...

32:14.800 --> 32:18.589
...into someone people look at
as if he's a monster!

32:19.520 --> 32:23.036
Now, whoever dies from this,
they've got it coming.

32:23.960 --> 32:26.316
- One minute!
- I may have something.

32:26.480 --> 32:30.554
I've hacked into something called
the Stability Augmentation System.

32:30.760 --> 32:33.798
I think I can feed data into
the Heading Reference System centers.

32:33.960 --> 32:36.429
- Override the controls.
- Can't you shut down the rotor?

32:36.640 --> 32:38.597
- You mean...
- I mean turn the damn thing off.

32:43.840 --> 32:45.513
Right. Right.

32:47.920 --> 32:49.673
- I got it. I got it.
- Then do it.

32:49.840 --> 32:51.035
Yeah...

32:51.200 --> 32:53.715
- What's wrong?
- If I click on this, he'll die.

32:53.880 --> 32:56.076
I killed somebody once.
I can't take another life.

33:18.000 --> 33:19.434
Come on!

33:20.120 --> 33:22.157
No!

34:04.000 --> 34:05.593
I'm sorry.

34:05.960 --> 34:08.793
For what? You did your job.

34:09.239 --> 34:11.118
And then I did mine.

34:25.080 --> 34:28.072
Hello, Maya.
You're a difficult woman to find.

34:28.239 --> 34:31.074
- Who are you?
- And you must be Skyler.

34:31.239 --> 34:32.435
My name is Raymond.

34:32.600 --> 34:35.069
I've been looking forward
to meeting you, Skyler.

34:35.239 --> 34:37.311
Did Owen send you?
Is that why you're here?

34:37.480 --> 34:39.676
No. But from what I understand...

34:39.840 --> 34:42.514
...your ex-husband poses
no further threat.

34:42.719 --> 34:46.396
You have nothing to fear
and no reason to run anymore.

34:46.840 --> 34:49.992
- Are you with the police?
- Oh, my goodness, no.

34:50.159 --> 34:54.234
I'm simply an interested third party
who needs your assistance.

34:54.440 --> 34:56.159
Here we go.

34:58.080 --> 35:02.154
One chocolate, one strawberry...

35:03.960 --> 35:05.838
...and one caramel.

35:06.040 --> 35:07.918
Forgive me, I took the liberty.

35:08.120 --> 35:11.955
In my experience,
caramel sauce is an excellent lubricant...

35:12.120 --> 35:14.680
...when it comes
to awkward introductions.

35:14.880 --> 35:19.955
Skyler, any chance I could convince
you to go thirds with us on these?

35:28.200 --> 35:30.999
That's all you want?
To meet with Sky's doctor?

35:31.160 --> 35:34.790
- His hematologist, yes.
- Do you have a child with special needs?

35:34.960 --> 35:38.556
Picasso said it took four years
to paint like Raphael...

35:38.720 --> 35:41.792
...but a lifetime to paint like a child.

35:42.240 --> 35:45.074
They live in a delightful space...

35:45.240 --> 35:48.119
...somewhere between dreams
and reality.

35:48.280 --> 35:53.150
They taste color,
hear shapes, see sounds.

35:54.720 --> 35:58.111
We should all have such special needs.

36:00.840 --> 36:01.876
There is a child.

36:03.000 --> 36:05.276
Her life hangs in the balance.

36:05.720 --> 36:09.396
I believe Skyler's doctor could save her.

36:19.720 --> 36:21.757
Hey, hey. Nice work today.

36:21.920 --> 36:25.311
It is no small thing to prevent Manhattan
from being unlivable.

36:26.160 --> 36:27.879
As opposed to unaffordable.

36:28.080 --> 36:29.560
You made the wrong call today.

36:32.200 --> 36:34.271
I'm sorry you think so.

36:37.360 --> 36:38.396
Is there anything else?

36:39.720 --> 36:41.757
No, that... That's it.

36:46.520 --> 36:50.673
- Mr. Cooper understood.
- He was trying to make you feel better.

36:50.840 --> 36:53.309
- Your girlfriend will too.
- Is that what this is about?

36:53.520 --> 36:55.193
The fact that I have a girlfriend?

36:55.400 --> 36:56.834
You put people's lives at risk.

36:57.000 --> 36:59.117
It's more important to me
than whether or not you have a girlfriend.

36:59.320 --> 37:00.913
You know what?

37:07.880 --> 37:11.510
- Forget it.
- Mind closing the door on your way out?

37:21.920 --> 37:25.118
You know when I congratulated you
on submitting your transfer request?

37:26.160 --> 37:28.994
I didn't mean it.
I was trying to make you feel better.

37:29.160 --> 37:31.595
Because that's the polite thing to do.

37:31.760 --> 37:33.035
And I like being polite.

37:33.960 --> 37:37.192
What I wanted to say was...

37:39.080 --> 37:40.400
...I'm glad you're going.

37:40.560 --> 37:44.270
As far as I'm concerned,
you can't go fast enough.

37:54.960 --> 37:58.670
- We talked about this! We agreed.
- On how you felt. I told you I disagreed.

37:58.880 --> 38:02.237
What you didn't tell me is that
you were gonna do something about it.

38:02.400 --> 38:06.440
Instead, you went behind my back
and did exactly what I told you not to do.

38:06.600 --> 38:09.069
- And with Reddington's help.
- It wasn't Reddington.

38:09.240 --> 38:10.959
- Then who?
- A guy I used to work with.

38:11.120 --> 38:13.794
When you were a skinhead,
one of Berlin's thugs?

38:13.960 --> 38:16.236
Because I'm guessing
it wasn't a school teacher.

38:16.400 --> 38:18.119
I'm not gonna fight about this, Liz.

38:18.280 --> 38:20.954
I did what I thought was best!

38:21.120 --> 38:23.874
And nobody is sorrier than me
that it didn't work!

38:24.040 --> 38:27.238
Oh, no, I know someone who is sorrier.

38:27.720 --> 38:32.431
Our daughter, who now,
because of you, is God-knows-where.

38:46.600 --> 38:49.115
I know you don't want to...

38:52.040 --> 38:54.714
...but you need to use the child.

39:03.480 --> 39:08.111
You asked me how this case
is connected to finding Agnes.

39:09.200 --> 39:13.752
Owen Ayers and his son Skyler
share a rare blood disorder.

39:13.920 --> 39:20.190
But Dr. Sebastian Reifler is one
with a particularly relevant distinction.

39:20.360 --> 39:24.274
He treats both Skyler Ayers
and Alexander Kirk.

39:24.640 --> 39:27.997
If we can get to his doctor,
we can get to Kirk.

39:28.840 --> 39:31.150
We're getting close, Lizzy.

39:32.480 --> 39:34.437
It won't be long now.

39:36.720 --> 39:38.200
I lied to you.

39:38.640 --> 39:41.838
You asked if Kirk had reached out
and I told you he hadn't.

39:43.520 --> 39:45.512
That wasn't true.

39:47.440 --> 39:49.875
He set up a link...

39:50.360 --> 39:53.592
...a video feed so I could see Agnes.

39:53.760 --> 39:55.672
How incredibly cruel.

39:55.840 --> 39:58.196
Tom tried to trace the link,
tried to find Agnes...

39:58.360 --> 40:03.276
- ...but Kirk found out and now...
- She's gone.

40:04.520 --> 40:08.639
I thought I could make it better,
that I could protect my baby.

40:10.160 --> 40:12.595
I mean, that's my one job...

40:12.800 --> 40:14.951
...to protect my child...

40:15.880 --> 40:18.793
...make her feel safe at any cost...

40:18.960 --> 40:21.077
...to hold her...

40:21.240 --> 40:23.914
...to tell her everything's gonna be okay.

40:25.520 --> 40:28.035
But now because of me,
because of what I've done...

40:28.200 --> 40:29.600
...I can't even do that.

40:54.160 --> 40:56.880
Forgive the Shanghai summons,
Dr. Reifler...

40:57.040 --> 41:01.000
...but I have a matter of some urgency
we must discuss.

41:01.160 --> 41:02.913
You.

41:03.480 --> 41:06.712
I don't... I don't understand.

41:06.880 --> 41:08.997
- Skyler Ayers...
- Is doing fine.

41:09.160 --> 41:11.470
It's another patient of yours
I'm interested in.

41:11.640 --> 41:14.519
Please, I don't... I can't help.

41:14.680 --> 41:16.637
Oh, yes, you can.

41:17.440 --> 41:18.669
And you will...

41:18.840 --> 41:20.672
...by allowing me to accompany you...

41:20.840 --> 41:25.710
...on your next house call
to Alexander Kirk.
