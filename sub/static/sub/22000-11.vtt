WEBVTT

00:03.804 --> 00:06.638
Oh, and some orange lozenges.

00:06.640 --> 00:08.374
They taste like
furniture polish,

00:08.376 --> 00:10.175
But I can't taste
anything right now, anyway.

00:10.177 --> 00:12.111
And I love the color.

00:12.113 --> 00:15.214
Frank, you is sick,
you should be home.

00:15.216 --> 00:17.816
Not here,
infecting people, like me.

00:17.818 --> 00:19.385
Oh, I'm past
the infectious stage.

00:19.387 --> 00:21.320
- You should've seen me yesterday.
- I did.

00:21.322 --> 00:23.622
And it's all just
clearing itself out now.

00:23.624 --> 00:26.625
- Oh, frank, you can't
be doing like that.

00:26.627 --> 00:28.327
Why? I'll pay for it.

00:28.329 --> 00:30.396
How much?
Twenty-five cents a squeeze?

00:32.933 --> 00:34.566
That reminds me of a girl back
at our local dance hall...

00:34.568 --> 00:37.336
No, hand sanitizer
make super bug.

00:37.338 --> 00:39.304
That's why so many
people is sick now.

00:39.306 --> 00:40.406
Is that really true?

00:41.375 --> 00:43.208
I read in <i>Ms. Chatelaine</i>
that's just a myth.

00:45.179 --> 00:47.713
Customer coming in sick,
buy hand sanitizer,

00:47.715 --> 00:50.816
Blow nose, rub hand sanitizer,
then come back sick again.

00:50.818 --> 00:54.219
- Sick, blow, rub.
- Cycle keep going.

00:55.289 --> 00:57.656
That's an interesting theory,
I'll give you that.

00:57.658 --> 00:59.491
But here's the gnat
in the nightcap.

00:59.493 --> 01:02.194
If you're so against the stuff,
why do you sell it?

01:02.196 --> 01:05.264
Cycle is bad for health,
but good for business.

01:05.266 --> 01:06.565
$22.95.

01:06.567 --> 01:08.267
Ouch.

01:32.560 --> 01:34.626
It's a high-impact,
interval-based,

01:34.628 --> 01:35.794
Life-train program.

01:35.796 --> 01:38.263
Looks like a t-shirt.

01:38.265 --> 01:39.364
I meant the business.

01:39.366 --> 01:40.933
Oh! Okay, thank you.

01:40.935 --> 01:43.469
- No problem.
- You take bag of chip?

01:43.471 --> 01:46.538
Hot ranch, like cool ranch,
but with hot.

01:46.540 --> 01:48.607
I'll pass.
I have a bun-blitz in five.

01:49.176 --> 01:50.342
I'll see you around,
neighbour.

01:50.344 --> 01:51.410
Okay, bye.

01:53.914 --> 01:55.714
- Who's that?
- Daniel.

01:55.716 --> 01:56.748
From next door.

01:59.386 --> 02:01.487
What's crash fit?

02:01.789 --> 02:04.857
Best new Toronto workout.
Now magazine.

02:04.859 --> 02:06.859
Lots of member
coming and going.

02:06.861 --> 02:08.560
Sound like perfect neighbour.

02:08.562 --> 02:10.829
We don't talk to them,
they don't talk to us,

02:10.831 --> 02:12.331
That's a perfect neighbour.

02:12.333 --> 02:14.333
Oh, you have to talk to
neighbour sometime.

02:14.568 --> 02:17.836
Garbage day,
mail mix up, parking space...

02:17.838 --> 02:20.339
Just leave note,
then call police.

02:20.341 --> 02:22.508
Like you do with flower shop?
Hmm?

02:22.510 --> 02:26.211
They so good neighbour.
Why you report them
for sidewalk display?

02:26.213 --> 02:27.513
How you know I report?

02:27.515 --> 02:29.214
It's anonymous tip line.

02:29.216 --> 02:30.649
How you know that
if you not report?

02:31.719 --> 02:34.820
Daniel is nice man,
good business.

02:34.822 --> 02:36.221
Don't be like that.

02:36.223 --> 02:38.657
Okay, okay.

02:39.627 --> 02:41.527
I try to be good neighbour.

02:41.529 --> 02:44.429
This time is different,
I can feel.

02:47.635 --> 02:48.800
Yeah.

02:48.802 --> 02:51.570
I can feel and hear, too.

02:51.572 --> 02:53.372
All right, people,
grab your kettlebells

02:53.374 --> 02:55.541
And let's do this!

02:58.612 --> 02:59.678
I can try.

03:03.250 --> 03:04.683
- Everything okay?
- Yeah.

03:04.685 --> 03:06.351
It's just this guy
wants to upgrade

03:06.353 --> 03:08.554
To a full size,
with satellite radio and GPS.

03:08.556 --> 03:09.621
You can do that.

03:09.623 --> 03:11.823
I want to make it seem
like I really had
to fight for it.

03:11.825 --> 03:13.425
Hmm.

03:13.427 --> 03:14.960
Does this help?

03:14.962 --> 03:17.796
And some of this.
Because this guy asked for it.

03:17.798 --> 03:20.666
This is definitely
what two humans
arguing looks like.

03:20.668 --> 03:22.234
Exactly.

03:22.236 --> 03:23.835
Whoa!

03:23.837 --> 03:26.538
- Too much?
- You definitely
won the argument.

03:26.540 --> 03:27.873
I'm pretty persuasive.

03:29.443 --> 03:31.443
Whoa. Marlow in trouble?

03:31.445 --> 03:32.544
Or are you in trouble?

03:32.546 --> 03:33.979
Wait, am I in trouble?

03:33.981 --> 03:34.981
No.

03:35.849 --> 03:37.849
Hey. Would it be weird
if I asked Marlow out?

03:37.851 --> 03:39.384
You know, 'cause I'm her boss.

03:39.386 --> 03:41.286
Not if it gets you
off the Shannon train.

03:41.288 --> 03:42.454
Dude, I'm off that train.

03:42.456 --> 03:44.389
Okay,
but you're running beside it.

03:44.391 --> 03:46.825
And I think
there's a cliff coming up
and a bridge for the train.

03:46.827 --> 03:48.327
You see where
I'm going with this?

03:48.329 --> 03:49.494
Yeah, but there's
a pedestrian bridge

03:49.496 --> 03:50.662
Right next to
the train bridge.

03:50.664 --> 03:52.397
That they closed in 2004.

03:52.399 --> 03:54.633
- I just stop running.
- There's coyotes behind you.

03:54.635 --> 03:55.901
- How many?
- A hundred.

03:55.903 --> 03:57.343
- I'm going to ask Marlow out.
- Hmm.

03:58.272 --> 04:00.192
I'm glad me and the coyotes
talked you into this.

04:07.281 --> 04:08.513
Did you tell her 10:00?

04:08.515 --> 04:10.449
Oh, wow.
You're starting already.

04:10.451 --> 04:11.550
Starting what?

04:12.486 --> 04:13.863
No offense, but sometimes
you can be kind of...

04:13.887 --> 04:14.286
- On time?
- Judgmental.

04:14.288 --> 04:15.721
I am not.

04:16.724 --> 04:19.358
Okay, you're just direct.
With your strong opinions.

04:19.360 --> 04:22.027
Which I love.
I think it's fantastic.

04:22.029 --> 04:23.629
But it's kind
of the reason why

04:23.631 --> 04:24.997
I haven't introduced
you two yet.

04:24.999 --> 04:26.632
Even though you've been
dating her for a month?

04:26.634 --> 04:27.899
See, there's the judgment.

04:27.901 --> 04:30.302
Which I know and love.

04:30.604 --> 04:32.437
- Hey!
- Hey!

04:33.807 --> 04:35.407
Chelsea, this is Janet.

04:35.409 --> 04:36.575
Janet, this is...

04:36.577 --> 04:38.310
Okay,
I feel like you guys get it.

04:38.312 --> 04:39.378
Hi.

04:39.380 --> 04:40.712
It's nice to finally meet you.

04:40.714 --> 04:42.014
You too.

04:42.016 --> 04:43.882
Oh, I like your water bottle.

04:43.884 --> 04:45.083
Oh, thanks.

04:45.085 --> 04:46.952
It's more fun
drinking out of a forest.

04:47.755 --> 04:48.920
I get that.

04:50.724 --> 04:51.957
All set to order?

04:51.959 --> 04:53.692
Er, you guys go first.

04:53.694 --> 04:55.627
Well,
I'll have the grilled cheese.

04:55.629 --> 04:58.864
I will have the...

05:01.435 --> 05:02.601
Pancakes.

05:03.570 --> 05:04.503
Ooh, that sounds good.
I'll have the pancakes, too.

05:04.505 --> 05:06.972
Actually, no.
I'm gonna change
to huevos rancheros.

05:06.974 --> 05:09.007
You know what? Me too.

05:09.009 --> 05:10.609
Well, I'll still
have the grilled cheese.

05:10.611 --> 05:12.477
So one grilled cheese,
two huevos.

05:13.514 --> 05:15.847
I'm so sorry,
I'm going back to pancakes.

05:16.950 --> 05:19.751
I'm so sorry, me too.

05:19.753 --> 05:22.621
Great, I'll just take those.

05:22.923 --> 05:23.989
Now.

05:27.728 --> 05:28.960
Okay, see you.

05:30.431 --> 05:33.532
Sports drink
turning into big profit.

05:33.534 --> 05:35.867
Sport drink turning
into sweat on floor.

05:35.869 --> 05:37.402
Like detox.

05:37.404 --> 05:39.004
What you know
about detox?

05:39.006 --> 05:40.439
All sweaty
- customer talk about.

05:40.441 --> 05:45.444
Detox body, blast calf,
grind core.

05:45.446 --> 05:47.446
Sound so painful
to be healthy.

05:48.482 --> 05:50.782
Oh, thank you, Jesus.

05:52.453 --> 05:53.518
Hmm?

05:55.022 --> 05:59.024
Sound like
boot-camp is finish,
now starting bootie camp.

05:59.026 --> 06:01.460
Sound same, not same thing.

06:02.463 --> 06:05.430
<i>Yeobo,</i>
tell him to turn down music.

06:05.432 --> 06:07.699
What? And be bad neighbour?

06:07.701 --> 06:09.768
Hmm. I like music.

06:09.770 --> 06:10.969
Keep customer moving.

06:14.507 --> 06:15.906
<i>♪ Come to Kim’s convenience
going to buy sports drink</i>

06:15.909 --> 06:19.144
<i>♪ maybe take a shower</i>
<i>then come back</i>
<i>and buy some more ♪</i>

06:20.514 --> 06:22.481
Okay, okay. Now go tell.

06:22.483 --> 06:23.582
Really?

06:23.584 --> 06:25.517
You know what you
asking me to do?

06:26.620 --> 06:29.020
See, that's my boy.
Bringing me a coffee.

06:29.022 --> 06:30.455
It's for Marlow.

06:30.457 --> 06:33.191
- Really?
- Yeah.

06:33.193 --> 06:34.559
Bringing her a coffee.

06:34.561 --> 06:35.627
What? It's just a coffee.

06:35.963 --> 06:37.462
Just a coffee.

06:39.466 --> 06:39.798
It's not a big deal.

06:39.799 --> 06:40.131
- Not a big...
- Hey! Seriously,
can we stop this?

06:40.134 --> 06:42.734
- Yeah. I'm surprised
you let it go on this long.

06:49.076 --> 06:50.909
M'latte.

06:50.911 --> 06:52.043
Did you just call me a latte?

06:52.045 --> 06:53.478
You're welcome.

06:54.515 --> 06:56.481
And if you like that,
I have an idea
for us at lunch.

06:56.483 --> 06:57.516
Oh, really?

06:57.518 --> 06:58.850
Yeah. I know a Tibetan place.

06:58.852 --> 07:00.051
Best momos in town.

07:00.521 --> 07:01.953
I call my grandmother momo.

07:02.523 --> 07:04.055
Okay, second best momos.

07:04.057 --> 07:05.524
I have two grandmothers.

07:05.526 --> 07:06.970
Bet you like one of
them more, though.

07:06.994 --> 07:08.493
See you at lunch.

07:10.063 --> 07:12.764
- Momos at lunch.
- Seriously, that's filthy.

07:13.066 --> 07:14.666
Hmm!

07:15.803 --> 07:16.902
Hi, Daniel.

07:17.438 --> 07:18.637
What's going on?

07:18.639 --> 07:22.174
We get liquid apology
for such loud music.

07:22.176 --> 07:23.642
I got quite a talking to.

07:23.644 --> 07:25.477
And that's not
even angry appa.

07:25.679 --> 07:28.914
- So you work everything out?
- Yeah.

07:28.916 --> 07:31.016
Try yellow ginger lemonade.

07:31.018 --> 07:32.551
Oh, no, I don't like lemon.

07:32.553 --> 07:34.920
- There's no lemon in it.
- It's like magic.

07:34.922 --> 07:37.556
Sometimes it's better
when life takes away lemons.

07:37.858 --> 07:40.225
And since when you like juice?

07:40.227 --> 07:42.761
Oh, it's not just juice,
it's... Elixir mixture!

07:42.763 --> 07:44.696
Elixir mixture!

07:45.666 --> 07:47.199
Health is so important.

07:47.201 --> 07:48.934
You have twinkie
for breakfast.

07:52.940 --> 07:54.840
You okay?
- Or is that how we're
storing things now?

07:54.842 --> 07:57.008
No, it's nothing.

07:57.010 --> 07:58.577
Okay, I'll take care of it.

07:58.579 --> 07:59.978
No, it's not that.

07:59.980 --> 08:03.548
Well, yes, that too,
but it's Alejandro and I...

08:04.084 --> 08:05.884
Anyway, they say
that fighting's healthy.

08:06.720 --> 08:07.886
What happened?

08:08.856 --> 08:10.656
He asked me
to move in with him,
and I said no.

08:10.724 --> 08:11.923
Good.

08:11.925 --> 08:17.128
I mean, if you're not ready,
it's good that you're
not rushing into it.

08:17.130 --> 08:19.064
That's what I said,
and then he was all

08:19.066 --> 08:22.267
"what are you scared of?"
and "I can deal with
your mouth guard."

08:22.269 --> 08:25.203
I probably
shouldn't be talking
about this right now.

08:25.205 --> 08:27.005
I'm here if you need
someone to listen.

08:27.007 --> 08:29.508
Oh, that's sweet,
but you don't want
to hear me vent.

08:29.743 --> 08:31.076
Vent away.

08:31.678 --> 08:34.079
Sometimes
it's good to have
an outside perspective.

08:34.481 --> 08:36.147
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

08:36.717 --> 08:37.816
Maybe at lunch?

08:39.887 --> 08:41.553
Sure, you got it.

08:41.555 --> 08:42.787
Okay. Great.

08:42.789 --> 08:44.656
Now back to not
thinking about how

08:44.658 --> 08:46.324
I might not have
a boyfriend anymore.

08:46.326 --> 08:47.659
Yeah. Me too.

08:48.695 --> 08:50.595
About you. Supportively.

08:50.931 --> 08:52.297
Outside perspective.

08:52.299 --> 08:53.865
- See you at lunch.
- okay.

09:02.676 --> 09:04.709
Here she be.

09:04.711 --> 09:07.112
Not Janet. But the apartment.

09:07.114 --> 09:09.848
Ooh! I love the couch.

09:09.850 --> 09:11.082
That was all Gerald.

09:11.084 --> 09:12.717
I actually found it
in the back alley.

09:12.719 --> 09:13.752
The selection
wasn't great.

09:13.754 --> 09:15.587
Plus, there's a guy sleeping
where it used to be,

09:15.589 --> 09:16.888
So I feel kind of bad.

09:17.691 --> 09:19.724
Hey, you got the water bottle.

09:20.060 --> 09:21.626
- Cool.
- Yeah!

09:21.628 --> 09:24.129
Like you say,
makes drinking water more fun.

09:24.998 --> 09:27.265
And going to the bathroom
more frequent.

09:27.267 --> 09:29.034
- Where is...
- End of the hall.

09:32.973 --> 09:35.040
Hey, sorry about yesterday.

09:35.042 --> 09:37.909
I was just a little anxious
about the whole introduction.

09:37.911 --> 09:39.311
But I'm glad you guys
are getting along so well.

09:39.313 --> 09:40.679
- She's great.
- Yeah.

09:40.681 --> 09:42.147
She even got the same
water bottle as you?

09:42.149 --> 09:44.149
Yeah. I noticed that.

09:45.018 --> 09:46.184
Here we go.

09:46.186 --> 09:47.919
I was just going to say...

09:47.921 --> 09:49.020
It's cute.

09:49.723 --> 09:51.790
- Really?
- Yeah, it's a sweet gesture

09:51.792 --> 09:54.626
That she wants to have
the exact same
water bottle as me.

09:54.628 --> 09:56.227
It's a mass-produced
water bottle.

09:56.229 --> 09:57.829
That comes in lots
of different colours.

09:57.831 --> 09:59.331
Practically everyone
at school has one.

09:59.333 --> 10:00.899
Not forest blue.

10:00.901 --> 10:03.134
Anyway,
I'm not saying it's bad,

10:03.136 --> 10:06.338
It's just
a charming coincidence.

10:07.007 --> 10:08.173
Like the brunch order.

10:08.175 --> 10:09.774
I knew you were
going to bring that up.

10:09.776 --> 10:10.842
She changed her
order three times!

10:10.844 --> 10:11.910
Oh. So did you!

10:11.912 --> 10:13.244
Exactly!

10:13.246 --> 10:15.780
Oh, listen,
she's flushing the toilet.

10:15.782 --> 10:17.422
I'm guessing she stole
that from you, too.

10:20.253 --> 10:22.754
- Hey.
- You ready?

10:22.756 --> 10:24.022
Yeah. Let's go.

10:24.791 --> 10:28.860
Oh, shoot,
shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot.

10:28.862 --> 10:30.695
Sounds serious.

10:30.697 --> 10:32.297
In an Archie Andrews
kind of way.

10:32.299 --> 10:35.400
Sorry. It's a work thing.
I've gotta tackle it
over lunch.

10:35.402 --> 10:36.768
Oh.

10:36.770 --> 10:39.037
- Another time?
- Sure.

10:39.039 --> 10:41.339
- Okay, Jung. I'm good to go.
- Right. Let's get out of here.

10:41.341 --> 10:44.409
I know.
I can't even think
about work right now.

10:44.411 --> 10:46.811
- Good one.
- See you later.

10:46.813 --> 10:47.679
Have fun, you two.

10:47.681 --> 10:49.381
It won't be fun.
More of a work thing.

10:49.383 --> 10:52.250
You drive.
It's chardonnay o'clock
for this girl.

11:01.161 --> 11:03.728
- Why you not eating rice?
- Hmm.

11:03.730 --> 11:06.331
It's a good idea
to stay away from starch.
Daniel say.

11:06.933 --> 11:08.133
Then must be true.

11:08.735 --> 11:09.968
Why you say like that?

11:11.004 --> 11:13.772
Rice is healthy.
Everyone in whole
world eating rice.

11:13.774 --> 11:16.074
Not everyone in
world is healthy. Hmm?

11:18.211 --> 11:21.780
You always tell to me,
<i>"yeobo,</i> stop eating cookie.

11:21.782 --> 11:25.016
"Stop eating chip.
Stop eating cool whip
straight from tub."

11:25.018 --> 11:28.053
And you never listen.
But when Daniel say...

11:28.055 --> 11:30.989
Hmm. Maybe it's not
what you say, but how you say.

11:31.758 --> 11:32.924
What you talking?

11:33.794 --> 11:35.026
Hmm.

11:35.028 --> 11:40.265
Daniel is always so nice,
always encourage,
smile, so positive.

11:41.001 --> 11:42.467
I am positive.

11:44.271 --> 11:45.503
Yeah...

11:45.505 --> 11:47.806
Daniel say I am not positive?

11:47.808 --> 11:49.088
Okay.
Time for after-dinner walk.

11:49.276 --> 11:52.010
Daniel say...
Yeah, never mind.

11:52.012 --> 11:54.179
Yeah, go.
Take walk all by yourself.

11:54.181 --> 11:57.449
While I have fun here.
Alone. See?

11:57.451 --> 11:59.884
I can be positive, too.

12:07.461 --> 12:10.195
I can't believe
I slept through
Gerald leaving.

12:10.197 --> 12:12.464
- Neither can I.
He fell in the shower twice.

12:13.066 --> 12:14.933
Oh. Are you making tea?

12:15.402 --> 12:18.436
- Yeah, want some?
- Please.

12:21.808 --> 12:22.974
How do you take it?

12:22.976 --> 12:24.375
However you're
having it is fine.

12:26.346 --> 12:28.079
- I'm having milk.
- Great.

12:31.418 --> 12:33.351
- Honey?
- Yeah.

12:39.459 --> 12:40.825
And jam.

12:42.062 --> 12:43.128
Oh.

12:43.930 --> 12:45.830
Is this about me copying you?

12:45.832 --> 12:46.898
What?

12:46.900 --> 12:49.033
- I got bagels.
- I won't have any.

12:49.035 --> 12:50.435
You sure. I got tons.

12:51.605 --> 12:56.574
Onion, I got poppy seed,
plain, no, that's onion,
and that...

12:56.576 --> 12:58.176
I think it's all onion.

12:58.178 --> 12:59.477
I can make you another cup.

12:59.479 --> 13:02.147
It's okay. I really
don't want to copy you.

13:02.149 --> 13:03.281
Oh.

13:04.217 --> 13:06.057
Yeah, sounds like
you told her something crazy.

13:06.319 --> 13:07.418
She just asked me
about the water bottle.

13:07.420 --> 13:09.120
- I'm sorry.
- What? No.

13:09.122 --> 13:10.155
I totally get it.

13:11.291 --> 13:13.572
I'd be flattered, but Gerald
said it's kind of your thing.

13:14.094 --> 13:15.460
Don't be ridiculous.
They're mass-produced
water bottles.

13:15.462 --> 13:17.362
Every other person
in this city has one.

13:17.364 --> 13:18.997
It's okay.
I still have the receipt.

13:18.999 --> 13:20.565
This is all
a misunderstanding.

13:20.567 --> 13:22.567
I think Gerald was more joking
than anything.

13:22.569 --> 13:23.968
You were pretty clear.

13:23.970 --> 13:25.203
Oh, my god.

13:25.505 --> 13:27.405
I'm gonna go shower.

13:27.407 --> 13:29.340
- You can use my shampoo.
- Soap is fine.

13:34.381 --> 13:37.115
In my defense,
I told her not to tell you.

13:38.318 --> 13:40.251
Hi, Mrs. Kim.
Oh, Pastor Nina.

13:40.253 --> 13:41.519
You doing crash fit?

13:41.521 --> 13:42.954
Yeah, I love it.

13:43.990 --> 13:45.523
Sadly, god did not bless me
with a high metabolism.

13:45.525 --> 13:48.059
So it's lunges and
crunches for this temple.

13:48.061 --> 13:51.095
You deserve reward.
Here. Take chocolate bar.

13:51.097 --> 13:53.231
Don't tempt me.
I have a wicked sweet tooth.

13:53.233 --> 13:54.499
Don't tell the man upstairs.

13:54.501 --> 13:56.167
Oh, Mr. Kim not home.

13:56.169 --> 13:58.603
No, I meant... Never mind.

13:58.605 --> 14:00.371
I'll just take the water.

14:00.373 --> 14:02.373
"The penguin can slip
as often as it wants,"

14:02.375 --> 14:04.375
"but the mountain
goat can only slip once."

14:04.811 --> 14:06.177
Oh, proverb?

14:06.179 --> 14:07.846
No. It's something
Daniel said next door.

14:07.848 --> 14:11.249
Daniel.
Mr. Kim always talking
about him.

14:11.251 --> 14:13.051
And fitness and juice.

14:13.053 --> 14:14.452
Oh, I take it
you're not a fan?

14:14.454 --> 14:16.588
Usually I get along
with neighbour.

14:16.590 --> 14:19.357
We don't have to love
every song in the hymn book.

14:19.359 --> 14:20.592
I mean,
how many times do we need

14:20.594 --> 14:22.060
To hear
<i>Onward, Christian Soldiers?</i>

14:22.062 --> 14:23.161
I like that one.

14:23.163 --> 14:24.462
And you sing it beautifully.

14:24.865 --> 14:27.232
My point is,
even a somewhat repetitive,

14:27.234 --> 14:29.434
Grating hymn can carry
a good message.

14:30.537 --> 14:32.604
Yeah, maybe.

14:34.107 --> 14:37.375
Hey, just a little thank you
for the talk yesterday.

14:37.377 --> 14:38.343
Yeah. No problem.

14:38.345 --> 14:42.447
So, did you stand your ground
and tell him you're not ready?

14:42.449 --> 14:44.482
- Like we talked about?
- Definitely.

14:44.484 --> 14:46.985
But that just
cranked it up a notch.

14:46.987 --> 14:48.920
We were up half
the night fighting.

14:48.922 --> 14:51.322
Sounds good. Erm, productive.

14:51.324 --> 14:53.157
But then we had this
total breakthrough.

14:53.159 --> 14:57.161
And we were up for the rest of
the night not fighting.

14:57.163 --> 14:59.464
We did not fight
until the sun came up.

15:01.902 --> 15:03.251
Huh.

15:03.252 --> 15:04.852
But seriously,
this is all thanks to you.

15:07.173 --> 15:09.040
Glad to be of help.

15:17.284 --> 15:21.252
I think the whole point of
leg day is to break a leg.

15:21.254 --> 15:23.655
- You actually do class?
- Yeah.

15:23.657 --> 15:26.958
Warm up is so hard,
make a grown man cry.

15:26.960 --> 15:28.693
- Really?
- Not me.

15:28.695 --> 15:31.663
I stop after warm up
to watch a man cry.

15:31.665 --> 15:34.232
Also,
because I almost pass out.

15:34.234 --> 15:36.034
- You want cookie?
- No.

15:36.636 --> 15:38.202
It's healthy cookie.

15:39.339 --> 15:41.659
I make for you because I know
you trying to be healthy now.

15:42.475 --> 15:43.641
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

15:43.643 --> 15:45.677
No sugar. Just vegetable.

15:45.679 --> 15:48.146
Smell just like
unhealthy cookie.

15:54.087 --> 15:56.421
- Taste just like unhealthy cookie!
- Yeah.

15:59.993 --> 16:01.492
Don't even need cool whip.

16:02.462 --> 16:03.528
Hmm!

16:09.302 --> 16:11.269
- Hey.
- Hey.

16:11.604 --> 16:13.671
Just thinking about you.

16:14.341 --> 16:15.540
This says Shannon.

16:15.542 --> 16:17.575
Yeah, I hate
giving my name at cafes.

16:17.577 --> 16:21.145
They're always like,
"John's up!"
but I'm Jung, so...

16:22.382 --> 16:27.618
Anyway, wanna do lunch? Dinner?
<i>Fast and Furious</i> marathon?

16:27.620 --> 16:30.455
Sure. I'm into a movie.
Tonight?

16:30.457 --> 16:33.091
- Awesome. Done.
- Cool.

16:33.093 --> 16:35.760
Hey, Kimchee, do you want
to see a movie tonight?

16:35.762 --> 16:37.428
- Okay.
- Great.

16:37.430 --> 16:41.766
Oh! Shoot, shoot, shoot.
This work thing just came up.

16:41.768 --> 16:44.469
Really important
car jockey stuff.

16:44.471 --> 16:46.004
Another time?

16:49.476 --> 16:51.376
Have fun with those coyotes.

16:59.285 --> 17:00.651
- Oh, hey.
- Hey.

17:00.653 --> 17:01.653
So...

17:02.489 --> 17:03.988
Is Chelsea okay?

17:03.990 --> 17:06.624
Yeah, she just went out
to get us some ice cream.

17:06.626 --> 17:09.427
I'm really sorry
about how this went down.

17:09.429 --> 17:10.628
But why did you tell her?

17:10.630 --> 17:12.497
I know. It was dumb, but...

17:12.499 --> 17:16.467
At first I thought you were being
ridiculous, but now I'm not so sure.

17:16.469 --> 17:18.102
No, she's sweet.

17:18.104 --> 17:20.538
Yeah, but she's
a little too keen.

17:20.540 --> 17:22.440
I might have
to break up with her.

17:22.442 --> 17:23.608
No.

17:23.610 --> 17:25.576
She just seems a little young.

17:25.578 --> 17:28.546
Yeah, maybe naive.
But she might just
not know who she is yet.

17:28.548 --> 17:30.048
Well, I know she means well...

17:30.050 --> 17:31.050
Hi.

17:32.052 --> 17:33.818
- Hey.
- You're back.

17:33.820 --> 17:35.787
Yeah, no line-up.
That place is great.

17:35.789 --> 17:37.422
It's so great.

17:37.424 --> 17:39.657
Sorry if I surprised you.
I didn't want to interrupt.

17:39.659 --> 17:40.758
It seemed like you
guys were talking

17:40.760 --> 17:42.560
About something
pretty intense.

17:42.562 --> 17:44.462
Kind of, but not really.

17:44.464 --> 17:47.698
I mean...
Did you hear any of it?

17:47.700 --> 17:48.800
I got you gelato.

17:49.769 --> 17:51.335
And it's not even close
to the flavour I ordered.

17:51.337 --> 17:53.171
You can order
whatever you want.

17:53.173 --> 17:54.839
You shouldn't
even listen to me.

17:54.841 --> 17:56.541
You really shouldn't,

17:56.543 --> 17:58.676
But if you were going to,
on a scale of one to 10,

17:58.678 --> 18:00.578
How good would you say
your listening skills are?

18:00.580 --> 18:04.248
Hey, I have faults, too.
Er, some people say
I'm judgmental.

18:04.250 --> 18:06.317
- Mmm-hmm.
- Oh, okay.

18:06.319 --> 18:08.086
I want to keep
going out with you.

18:08.088 --> 18:09.587
Great. Me, too.

18:09.589 --> 18:11.823
And no one's perfect.
All we can do is try our best.

18:11.825 --> 18:14.592
I totally agree.
Oh, but not in a copying way.

18:16.262 --> 18:18.196
I gotta go,
but I'll call you later.

18:18.198 --> 18:19.564
Okay. Great.

18:19.566 --> 18:21.699
I'm really keen to hang out
with you this weekend.

18:21.701 --> 18:24.836
- Bye.
- Bye.

18:31.144 --> 18:33.811
- Do you think she heard?
- I have no idea.

18:36.483 --> 18:38.349
Ice cream's melting.

18:40.420 --> 18:42.887
There's jam on mine.

18:42.889 --> 18:44.422
Here. Take two more.

18:44.424 --> 18:47.358
Oh, okay, if you're just
going to throw them out.

18:47.360 --> 18:48.559
I never say that.

18:48.561 --> 18:50.128
- Okay, well, thank you.
- Okay.

18:52.465 --> 18:54.632
You finish whole batch?

18:54.634 --> 18:56.667
No, I give some away.

18:56.669 --> 18:57.869
- That's nice.
- Yeah.

18:58.872 --> 19:01.472
Mr. Baran is happy he find
cookie he can finally eat.

19:01.474 --> 19:04.142
Yeah, soft.
Good for his denture.

19:04.144 --> 19:05.810
No, he has diabetes.

19:06.179 --> 19:08.112
Diabetes?

19:08.114 --> 19:09.647
Oh, you have to call him.

19:09.649 --> 19:11.215
I don't have his number.

19:11.217 --> 19:13.784
I don't even know if Baran
is his first or last name.

19:14.587 --> 19:16.621
- What's the problem?
- Cookie have sugar in.

19:17.357 --> 19:18.890
- But you say...
- I know.

19:18.892 --> 19:22.493
I try to make
cookie that is healthy
using carrot and beet,

19:22.495 --> 19:25.329
But then cookie just taste
like carrot and beet.

19:25.331 --> 19:27.465
So then, I add
a little bit of sugar.

19:27.467 --> 19:29.233
Then more.
- Then so much sugar.

19:29.235 --> 19:30.835
But I eat 20 cookie!

19:30.837 --> 19:32.603
Why you eat 20 cookie?

19:32.605 --> 19:34.205
Because you say it's healthy!

19:34.574 --> 19:36.307
Forgot olive oil.

19:36.309 --> 19:37.375
You eat cookie.

19:37.377 --> 19:38.776
No, I'm saving them
for dessert.

19:38.778 --> 19:40.311
Yeah, give to me.

19:45.852 --> 19:47.552
I just saved your life.

19:47.554 --> 19:51.322
I'm so sorry. It's a mistake.
Cookie have sugar in.

19:51.324 --> 19:54.225
You know, I can have
a little bit of sugar.

20:01.434 --> 20:03.401
Better safe than sorry.

20:09.876 --> 20:11.442
Morning, neighbours.

20:11.444 --> 20:14.278
Who's ready for
a charcoal-infused
celery-boost?

20:14.280 --> 20:16.614
Yeah, okay, I try.

20:16.616 --> 20:19.016
Never too late
for elixir mixture.

20:19.018 --> 20:20.851
That's great to hear, Mrs. K.

20:20.853 --> 20:23.254
Oh. And also,
I have this for you guys.

20:27.894 --> 20:30.928
Ten juice,
one drop-in quad squad...

20:30.930 --> 20:31.996
Quad squad?

20:31.998 --> 20:33.364
I'm so proud
that you're making

20:33.366 --> 20:34.565
This investment
in your health.

20:34.567 --> 20:35.700
Not everyone's
willing to do that.

20:35.702 --> 20:37.902
You charge me
for free t-shirt?

20:38.938 --> 20:40.838
Oh!
that should be two.

20:41.374 --> 20:44.542
It's not all friendly gift
for good neighbour?

20:44.544 --> 20:45.910
That's the 10% discount.

20:46.346 --> 20:48.846
We business owners can't give
it away for free, right?

20:48.848 --> 20:50.348
Yeah.

20:50.350 --> 20:51.382
No rush on that.

20:53.319 --> 20:55.519
Although tomorrow
is end of month.

20:55.722 --> 20:57.355
Don't be the penguin.

21:02.629 --> 21:06.697
Drink your charcoal.
You already pay $12 for it.

21:08.301 --> 21:10.401
Okay, everybody,
get your medicine ball.

21:10.403 --> 21:12.436
We're gonna start
with super squat presses.

21:12.739 --> 21:14.872
I go call anonymous tip line.

21:15.408 --> 21:17.908
- I go put dog poop
in his gym bag.
- Hmm.

21:17.910 --> 21:20.745
In three,
in two, and squat...
