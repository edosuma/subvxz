WEBVTT

00:04.676 --> 00:05.712
What?

00:05.744 --> 00:07.549
Oh, nothing.

00:09.186 --> 00:11.623
Pam's on vacation,
and she gets back tomorrow.

00:11.656 --> 00:14.662
So, it'll be nice to see her.
It'll be nice.

00:14.696 --> 00:18.071
And, uh, she set a date
for the wedding with Roy.

00:18.105 --> 00:19.806
Uh, June. Summer.

00:19.840 --> 00:22.178
So, that'll be nice.

00:22.213 --> 00:24.449
And that's that.

00:26.721 --> 00:28.524
What?

00:28.558 --> 00:32.532
Oh, nothing.

00:32.566 --> 00:36.774
Jim's been looking at me
kind of a lot all week.

00:36.806 --> 00:39.347
I would be creeped out by it,

00:39.379 --> 00:42.885
but it's nothing compared
to the way Michael looks at me.

00:56.881 --> 00:59.519
*

01:02.459 --> 01:09.339
*

01:26.541 --> 01:28.745
Spamster.

01:28.778 --> 01:33.620
Um...Pam, plus Spam,
plus--

01:33.654 --> 01:34.922
Hamster.
Right.

01:34.957 --> 01:36.327
Welcome back.
How was your vacation?

01:36.361 --> 01:37.329
It was great.

01:37.363 --> 01:38.798
Yeah?
Did you get lucky?

01:38.831 --> 01:41.371
Oop! Boink.

01:41.404 --> 01:43.875
Roy and I just got back
from the Poconos.

01:43.908 --> 01:46.546
I get ten vacation days a year.

01:46.580 --> 01:49.887
And I try to hold off taking
them for as along as possible.

01:49.920 --> 01:54.930
And this year I got to
the third week in January.

01:54.962 --> 01:56.401
I am Pam.

01:56.434 --> 01:58.271
Spicoli guy.

01:58.305 --> 02:00.241
Oh, God.

02:00.241 --> 02:02.512
He needs numbers.
Okay.

02:02.545 --> 02:05.585
Whoa! God! Yuck!
Yuck, yuck, yuck.

02:05.619 --> 02:06.920
What?
Yuck! Wow!

02:06.954 --> 02:08.390
What happened in there?

02:08.424 --> 02:10.026
I don't know.
There is stink in there.

02:10.060 --> 02:11.930
My God.

02:11.963 --> 02:13.934
What is that?

02:13.967 --> 02:15.971
Oh, I don't know.
Is that a bird?

02:16.005 --> 02:17.074
I don't think it's a bird.

02:17.106 --> 02:19.979
Oh, God, how could
that happen?

02:20.013 --> 02:21.048
How could--

02:21.082 --> 02:22.685
Right in the middle
of the carpet.

02:22.718 --> 02:23.888
What's going on?

02:23.920 --> 02:25.624
Uh, somebody vomited
right in the middle

02:25.659 --> 02:27.027
of the carpet in my office.

02:27.060 --> 02:28.764
I don't think that's vomit.

02:28.798 --> 02:30.701
Check it out.
Me?

02:30.734 --> 02:31.736
Check it out.

02:33.875 --> 02:35.544
Don't be a wuss.
Just get--

02:35.579 --> 02:37.648
No, I'm not holding
your coffee.

02:37.682 --> 02:39.552
Tell me what it is.
Oh, that's a real bitch.

02:39.587 --> 02:40.922
What is it?

02:40.955 --> 02:43.660
Michael.
What is it?

02:43.694 --> 02:44.997
No, just tell me what it is.

02:45.030 --> 02:46.633
Michael, I gotta get
outta here.

02:46.666 --> 02:48.637
I can't hold my breath
that long.

02:48.670 --> 02:49.873
Open the door up.

02:49.907 --> 02:53.013
It smelled terrible.

02:57.688 --> 02:59.460
Oh! Phew!

02:59.493 --> 03:00.361
Oh, no.
Mmm-mmm.

03:02.833 --> 03:05.070
I cannot believe a pipe burst
and left that there.

03:05.102 --> 03:06.941
That's no burst pipe.
Well, how do you know that?

03:06.973 --> 03:07.975
What is it then?

03:08.009 --> 03:12.818
Hey, guys.
Somebody making soup?

03:12.853 --> 03:15.190
Here she comes.

03:15.224 --> 03:18.530
All cleaned? Great.

03:19.532 --> 03:21.603
Too stinky.

03:21.637 --> 03:22.973
That is worse.

03:23.006 --> 03:26.012
She probably scrubbed it
into the fibers of the carpet.

03:26.044 --> 03:27.882
Total permeation.

03:27.916 --> 03:30.554
I am a big Fear Factor fan.

03:30.589 --> 03:33.561
Um, I'm a big fan of anything
Joe Rogan does, actually.

03:33.595 --> 03:36.967
So, this is sort of like
my audition tape.

03:37.001 --> 03:41.075
Um...

03:41.109 --> 03:43.146
I can't stand it.

03:43.178 --> 03:47.623
I can't stay in here
another second.

03:49.926 --> 03:51.830
Hey, welcome back.
Thanks.

03:51.863 --> 03:54.236
So, how was the resort?
Did you ski a lot?

03:54.268 --> 03:55.871
A little.

03:55.904 --> 03:58.944
Good.

03:58.978 --> 04:00.481
What's going on in here?

04:00.481 --> 04:05.825
What? I did not do that.

04:05.859 --> 04:09.030
That sounds disgusting.

04:09.065 --> 04:10.869
It wasn't me.

04:10.902 --> 04:14.942
Um...it wasn't me.

04:14.977 --> 04:16.245
It was not me.

04:16.279 --> 04:18.016
Oh.

04:18.049 --> 04:21.923
Wow.

04:24.630 --> 04:28.970
Hey, Jim, I thought
that we would be desk buddies

04:29.004 --> 04:31.611
while they change my carpet.

04:31.644 --> 04:34.782
That might be a little difficult
with the one computer.

04:34.817 --> 04:36.018
Oh.

04:36.052 --> 04:38.056
But there's definitely a desk
open in the back.

04:38.089 --> 04:39.827
Yeah...

04:39.859 --> 04:42.865
Which I guess
I'll be taking.

04:42.898 --> 04:44.235
No, no, no, seriously.
I don't mind sharing.

04:44.268 --> 04:48.711
No, no, no.
Seriously, I'll be in the back.

04:50.782 --> 04:53.119
Hey, Kelley.

04:53.153 --> 04:55.157
Are you moving
back here?

04:55.190 --> 04:58.798
Um, just for the day
while Michael's at my desk.

04:58.830 --> 05:00.333
Because Toby used to sit there.

05:00.368 --> 05:03.272
But then he had to move over
there because of an allergy.

05:03.307 --> 05:07.046
Allergy to...the desk?

05:07.080 --> 05:08.349
Weird.

05:09.819 --> 05:13.058
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Ol' bullpen.

05:13.093 --> 05:15.431
Ha, ha, ha.
The ol' bullpen.

05:15.464 --> 05:16.801
Don't hate me.

05:16.833 --> 05:18.268
Okay.

05:18.303 --> 05:19.940
This is great.

05:19.972 --> 05:20.875
Yeah.

05:20.908 --> 05:23.380
The pressures of my office
are insane.
Mmm.

05:23.413 --> 05:24.950
I just--you
couldn't understand.

05:24.982 --> 05:27.021
But, man, you guys have it
easy out here.

05:27.053 --> 05:29.057
You know, I used to sit
right here?

05:29.090 --> 05:30.292
No way.
Yeah.

05:30.327 --> 05:32.799
And who had your office?

05:32.833 --> 05:36.440
Ed Truck.
Yuck.

05:36.472 --> 05:38.945
Ed Truck was the manager
before me.

05:38.977 --> 05:40.981
Horrible.
He hated fun.

05:41.014 --> 05:43.052
It was like, oh, Ed Truck
is walking toward us.

05:43.085 --> 05:46.091
Stop having fun.
Start pretending to do work.

05:46.124 --> 05:48.997
What a jerk.
He's--

05:49.030 --> 05:50.468
You know what?

05:50.500 --> 05:52.103
I swore to myself,
that if I ever got

05:52.136 --> 05:53.741
to walk around the room
as manager,

05:53.775 --> 05:55.912
people would laugh
when they saw me coming.

05:55.944 --> 05:58.950
And would applaud
as I walked away.

05:58.985 --> 06:01.756
I'm serious, my closet doors
will not shut.

06:01.790 --> 06:02.859
I mean, it only takes so long

06:02.892 --> 06:05.898
to measure to make sure
that clothes will hang up.

06:05.932 --> 06:07.502
'Cause aren't all hangers,
like, that big?

06:07.534 --> 06:09.371
So I don't understand why
the closet engineer

06:09.405 --> 06:10.841
didn't think of that.

06:10.874 --> 06:12.211
So now I'm doing
this new thing

06:12.244 --> 06:14.482
where I just leave piles
of clothes on the floor.

06:14.515 --> 06:16.854
And I walk around the piles
to get an outfit...

06:16.886 --> 06:18.890
You know who used
to sit at that desk?

06:18.925 --> 06:21.028
That guy Miles who quit
to form his own company?

06:21.062 --> 06:23.165
Mmm-mmm. Todd Packer.

06:23.198 --> 06:25.070
No. I thought he was
out on the road.

06:25.102 --> 06:27.240
He was, but, uh...

06:27.274 --> 06:28.878
that desk was empty.

06:28.910 --> 06:31.349
He'd come in and sit
there sometimes.
Ah.

06:31.382 --> 06:34.923
When I was in training,

06:34.957 --> 06:37.896
many years ago,
not so long ago,

06:37.929 --> 06:41.904
I worked side by side
with a fellow named Todd Packer.

06:41.937 --> 06:43.975
And together we
rocked the office.

06:47.883 --> 06:51.288
Packer and I once spent
a whole day with our pants off.

06:51.322 --> 06:52.993
And when people noticed,

06:53.026 --> 06:54.395
we convinced them
that they were crazy.

06:54.429 --> 06:57.502
I would gladly pay you Tuesday
for a Hamburger today.

06:57.535 --> 06:59.606
Excuse me one second please.

06:59.638 --> 07:02.344
What is it that you need
right now that can't wait

07:02.376 --> 07:04.048
until I'm off the phone
with a customer?

07:04.081 --> 07:07.889
Ooh, a customer.
Well, sound the alarm.

07:07.923 --> 07:09.659
Okay.

07:09.692 --> 07:11.996
Another time, Packer held this
guy's head in the toilet

07:12.030 --> 07:13.233
for like a minute.

07:13.266 --> 07:14.937
Guy had no sense
of humor about it.

07:14.969 --> 07:16.071
Probably why he wasn't hired.

07:16.105 --> 07:17.574
Unnh!
Oh.

07:17.608 --> 07:19.045
What did you hit me for?

07:19.077 --> 07:21.348
Oh, Charlie horse.
Charlie horse!
What?

07:21.382 --> 07:22.986
You shouldn't have
hit me, Michael.

07:23.018 --> 07:24.421
Okay.
Gah.

07:24.456 --> 07:27.963
Once as a joke, Packer banged
every chick in the office.

07:27.996 --> 07:30.634
It was hysterical.

07:30.667 --> 07:35.043
BeyoncÃ©, pink, the color,
Pink, the person,

07:35.077 --> 07:38.049
hot dogs, basically anything
that is awesome.

07:38.083 --> 07:40.488
Sno-cones.
Hey, Jim,

07:40.521 --> 07:43.392
Michael wanted me to ask you how
to raise your desk chair.

07:43.426 --> 07:45.965
It's the lever on the side.

07:45.999 --> 07:48.103
That's what I told him.
Thanks.

07:52.144 --> 07:56.052
Oh, my God,
he is so cute.

07:56.085 --> 07:58.657
Would you talk to him for me
and see if he likes me?

07:58.689 --> 08:00.961
Oh, no, I don't think I can--

08:00.961 --> 08:03.534
Oh, please, Jim.
Please, please, Jim.

08:03.567 --> 08:05.170
Please, please, please?
He's so cute.

08:05.202 --> 08:06.639
I like him so much.

08:06.673 --> 08:08.376
And I would do it,
but I'm too shy.

08:08.408 --> 08:10.647
Please, Jim?
Please, please, please?

08:10.680 --> 08:13.486
Please, Jim, please?
Please, please?

08:13.519 --> 08:15.390
Dwight.

08:15.422 --> 08:17.161
Michael.

08:17.193 --> 08:19.031
Let's set up accounting.

08:19.065 --> 08:21.069
What?

08:21.102 --> 08:23.205
Old-fashioned raid.
Sales on accounting.

08:24.407 --> 08:27.146
Follow my lead.

08:28.817 --> 08:30.253
Hey, guys.

08:30.286 --> 08:32.156
Hey, Michael.
Hey, Dwight.
What's up?

08:32.191 --> 08:36.600
[Dwight and Michael
scream and laugh]

08:39.404 --> 08:42.276
Whoo hoo!

08:42.311 --> 08:44.081
Come on, come on, come on!

08:44.115 --> 08:47.854
Sales rules!

08:47.887 --> 08:52.665
Yeah, yeah!

08:52.698 --> 08:54.300
Should we help them
pick up their stuff?

08:54.335 --> 08:56.504
No, no, no, no.
We don't do that.

08:56.539 --> 08:58.677
Watch out, Pam.
You're next.

08:58.710 --> 09:00.412
You're gonna throw
my things on the ground?

09:00.446 --> 09:02.150
Maybe.

09:02.184 --> 09:04.387
What happened in Michael's
office was wrong.

09:04.421 --> 09:06.125
I understand it.

09:06.159 --> 09:09.297
It makes sense.

09:09.331 --> 09:12.838
But it's--but it was
still wrong.

09:12.871 --> 09:16.645
Why would somebody ruin
a perfectly good carpet?

09:16.680 --> 09:19.585
I don't know.

09:19.619 --> 09:22.256
Could be done out of hate.

09:22.291 --> 09:25.262
Could be done out of love.

09:25.297 --> 09:27.167
It could be completely neutral.

09:27.201 --> 09:29.605
Maybe somebody hates
the cleaning lady.

09:29.639 --> 09:33.914
Well, she doesn't
do a very good job, obviously.

09:33.946 --> 09:37.954
Because my office still reeks
like you would not believe.

09:37.987 --> 09:40.761
I hate her.

09:42.932 --> 09:43.899
You know what?

09:43.934 --> 09:45.370
I am beginning to think

09:45.402 --> 09:46.905
that what happened
to my carpet

09:46.940 --> 09:51.382
was an act of terrorism
against the office.

09:51.414 --> 09:53.386
The only thing
that makes any sense.

09:53.418 --> 09:55.522
Hello, am I
the 107th caller?

09:58.495 --> 10:01.201
Hello, Rock 107,
am I the 107th caller?

10:03.774 --> 10:08.483
Hello, Rock 107,
am I the 107th caller?

10:08.515 --> 10:10.352
I'm totally going to win us
that box set.

10:10.386 --> 10:11.354
Stop.

10:11.388 --> 10:14.828
Stop it.

10:14.861 --> 10:17.768
Stop it.

10:18.970 --> 10:21.342
Don't.

10:21.374 --> 10:22.912
Don't.

10:22.944 --> 10:24.615
I need to make
a sales call.

10:26.885 --> 10:28.323
Please.

10:28.356 --> 10:29.826
All right.

10:38.844 --> 10:42.484
Am I the 107th caller?

10:46.123 --> 10:48.496
Yeah, right.

10:56.043 --> 10:57.414
Every day I go to bed,

10:57.447 --> 10:59.785
and I have, like,
a weird pinch in my back.

10:59.819 --> 11:00.921
And when I wake up,
I feel fine.

11:00.954 --> 11:02.390
But it's so hard
to fall asleep.

11:02.424 --> 11:03.759
And I just hate it,

11:03.794 --> 11:06.063
cause I try to go to bed
at, like, 9:30 every night.

11:06.098 --> 11:07.100
Hi, guys.

11:07.132 --> 11:08.134
We haven't finished

11:08.168 --> 11:10.841
getting things in order
from your last visit.

11:10.873 --> 11:12.376
I'm just
walking around.
Were you?

11:12.411 --> 11:14.415
Well, yeah.
It's just that
we're really swamped

11:14.447 --> 11:15.718
over here, Michael.
Oh, and I'm not?

11:15.751 --> 11:17.922
Why would you say that?
Because I'm having fun?

11:17.955 --> 11:19.658
You guys just are working

11:19.691 --> 11:20.928
for the weekend, are you?

11:20.961 --> 11:22.496
I'm working for the week.

11:22.531 --> 11:23.900
Sales team.

11:23.934 --> 11:25.403
Listen to me.

11:25.437 --> 11:26.906
This is what we're
gonna do.

11:26.940 --> 11:29.445
I'm gonna up the ante
a little bit literally.

11:29.478 --> 11:31.750
Right here, I'm going
to put a crisp $100 bill.

11:31.782 --> 11:34.154
The person with the most sales
at the end of the day

11:34.186 --> 11:35.523
gets to keep the cash.

11:35.557 --> 11:37.427
Sound good?
Yeah!

11:37.461 --> 11:39.431
70, 80, 1, 2, 3.

11:39.465 --> 11:41.735
$83. Still a lot of money.

11:41.769 --> 11:44.541
And I'm going to...

11:44.575 --> 11:46.512
I'm going to leave it

11:46.545 --> 11:48.483
right over here

11:48.516 --> 11:50.151
where everybody
can see it.

11:50.186 --> 11:52.656
I will be taking
Jim's clients today

11:52.691 --> 11:54.528
because he is not here.

11:54.561 --> 11:57.066
And out of sight,
out of the contest.

11:57.100 --> 11:59.771
Let's see who winds up
with the cash, shall we?

11:59.805 --> 12:01.141
You're going to compete
against us?

12:01.173 --> 12:03.145
Oh, it is on, Phyllis!
It is so on!

12:03.178 --> 12:04.213
It is so on!

12:04.246 --> 12:05.115
God,
this is gonna be fun.

12:07.185 --> 12:09.792
Michael is gonna wipe
the floor with us.

12:19.176 --> 12:21.649
So you have 40 boxes
going out.

12:21.681 --> 12:23.919
And I will deliver those
personally in a Sebring.

12:23.953 --> 12:26.123
Very good.
Nice doing business with you.

12:26.158 --> 12:27.661
Thank you.

12:27.693 --> 12:29.263
Yeeeeeees!

12:29.297 --> 12:31.234
Ho ho ho ho. Yeah.

12:31.267 --> 12:33.305
* Read it and weep ugh *

12:33.337 --> 12:35.009
Ooh, look at that.

12:35.042 --> 12:37.013
Look at me, Phyllis.
Oh, what is that?

12:37.046 --> 12:38.282
That's my sale.

12:38.314 --> 12:40.653
* Mm mm mm mm mm

12:40.687 --> 12:41.955
* Mm

12:41.989 --> 12:45.762
* Aha aha aha mm mm mm *

12:45.798 --> 12:47.300
What
What you doing?

12:47.332 --> 12:48.102
Nothing.

12:48.135 --> 12:50.206
I think he's dancing.
No, just--

12:50.239 --> 12:51.273
That was definitely
not dancing.

12:51.308 --> 12:52.644
You know what, guys?

12:52.677 --> 12:53.814
It's none of your concern.

12:53.846 --> 12:54.981
It was official business.

12:55.015 --> 12:56.318
Paper business.
Yeah, paper business.

12:56.350 --> 12:58.188
Is this done?
No.

12:58.222 --> 12:59.257
Extreme Home Makeover

12:59.289 --> 13:01.194
puts together a house
in an hour.

13:01.228 --> 13:03.999
If you were on that crew,
you'd be fired like that.

13:04.034 --> 13:06.071
Somebody did something bad

13:06.104 --> 13:08.142
to Michael's carpet.

13:08.174 --> 13:11.280
Maybe that's all
we need to know.

13:17.393 --> 13:18.897
Who do you think did it?

13:18.929 --> 13:20.633
Are you kidding?
I thought it was you.

13:20.667 --> 13:22.203
Really. I thought you.

13:30.451 --> 13:31.955
This was no act of God.

13:31.990 --> 13:33.091
A person did this.

13:33.125 --> 13:34.761
A person who works
in this office.

13:34.795 --> 13:37.667
Maybe all of them.

13:37.701 --> 13:39.069
You know what?

13:39.103 --> 13:41.208
Today is not a good day

13:41.241 --> 13:43.077
for a sales contest.

13:43.111 --> 13:44.314
We're--we're--we're not
doing this today.

13:44.347 --> 13:46.719
That doesn't seem fair.

13:46.752 --> 13:48.288
You want to talk
about fair?

13:48.322 --> 13:50.359
Does anyone need to smell
my old carpet?

13:50.391 --> 13:52.129
You explain to me
how that was fair,

13:52.163 --> 13:53.966
and I'll explain to you
how this is fair.

13:53.999 --> 13:56.304
Plus I just--I think
that picking today

13:56.338 --> 13:58.175
was sort
of taking advantage.

13:58.208 --> 14:00.111
But you're the one
who picked today.

14:00.145 --> 14:01.681
I am a victim
of a hate crime.

14:01.681 --> 14:04.219
Stanley knows
what I'm talking about.

14:04.254 --> 14:06.423
That's not what
a hate crime is.

14:06.458 --> 14:08.929
Well, I hated it a lot,
okay?

14:08.964 --> 14:10.199
I

14:10.231 --> 14:12.270
If the guilty person
would just come forward

14:12.302 --> 14:15.709
and take their punishment,
we'd be done.

14:20.386 --> 14:22.155
Very well.

14:22.189 --> 14:23.392
Then you're all punished.

14:23.424 --> 14:24.426
What's our punishment?

14:24.460 --> 14:26.298
You're all on a time out.

14:26.331 --> 14:28.067
Just sit there quietly.

14:32.276 --> 14:35.416
No, no.

14:40.860 --> 14:42.495
Hey.
What's up?

14:42.530 --> 14:44.334
Nothing much.

14:44.367 --> 14:45.469
Let me ask you something.

14:45.501 --> 14:47.406
It's actually
a little awkward.

14:47.440 --> 14:50.948
What do you think
of Kelly?

14:50.981 --> 14:52.985
I don't know.

14:53.017 --> 14:55.991
Depends if you like
a little junk in...

14:56.023 --> 14:58.562
Um, she's really cool.

14:58.594 --> 15:00.198
Are you interested in her?

15:00.231 --> 15:01.434
Yeah, totally.

15:01.468 --> 15:03.105
Really.
Did she say something?

15:03.137 --> 15:05.208
She said
lots of things.

15:05.241 --> 15:06.543
Do you know
if she's looking

15:06.578 --> 15:08.515
for a long-term thing
or if she'd be cool

15:08.547 --> 15:11.353
just hanging out?

15:11.388 --> 15:13.158
I have no idea.

15:13.192 --> 15:14.895
Can you find out?

15:15.997 --> 15:17.066
Yeah.

15:17.099 --> 15:18.937
Sure.

15:20.572 --> 15:22.210
Oh, long-term,
definitely.

15:22.242 --> 15:23.979
Fall in love,
have babies,

15:24.014 --> 15:25.951
spend every second together.

15:25.983 --> 15:27.353
But don't tell him that,
okay?

15:27.386 --> 15:29.189
Just tell him I'm, like,
up for anything.

15:29.224 --> 15:31.661
I mean, I'm not a slut,
but who knows.

15:31.693 --> 15:33.665
Do you remember Ed Truck?

15:33.697 --> 15:36.138
Sure, he hired me.
How's he doing?

15:36.170 --> 15:37.540
How would I know?

15:37.573 --> 15:39.209
I thought you might.

15:39.243 --> 15:41.983
My biggest fear
is turning into him.

15:42.016 --> 15:44.319
Michael, you should have
much bigger fears than that.

15:44.353 --> 15:45.522
I wasn't talking
literally, Creed.

15:45.556 --> 15:48.562
Yeah, being buried alive
would be worse.

15:48.595 --> 15:49.530
Happy?

15:49.564 --> 15:51.501
Why am I talking to you?

15:51.534 --> 15:53.974
Ed? Hi, thanks
for meeting me.

15:55.741 --> 15:58.214
Must be kind of neat
coming back.

15:58.247 --> 15:59.617
Yeah. Shall we go upstairs?

15:59.649 --> 16:01.088
Uh, well, honestly, Ed,

16:01.121 --> 16:03.058
I really don't want
to be up there right now.

16:03.092 --> 16:06.030
So what's the problem
with my pension?

16:06.064 --> 16:07.665
Oh, no, no, no.
You're good.

16:07.700 --> 16:09.504
It was clerical.
You're good.

16:09.536 --> 16:11.040
Um, well,

16:11.073 --> 16:12.343
somebody did something
in my office,

16:12.375 --> 16:14.579
and I now think that they
did it on purpose

16:14.613 --> 16:16.083
and it was directed at me.

16:16.117 --> 16:17.320
But what was done?

16:17.353 --> 16:19.557
I didn't get
a good look at it.

16:19.589 --> 16:22.662
But it smells horrible.

16:22.696 --> 16:26.471
Yeah, somebody once
did that in my office.

16:26.504 --> 16:27.640
Really.
Yeah.

16:27.672 --> 16:28.642
Well, that figures.

16:28.674 --> 16:32.783
So how did you deal
with people not liking you?

16:32.815 --> 16:35.455
You can't expect
to be friends with everybody.

16:35.489 --> 16:37.325
Well, sure I can.

16:37.359 --> 16:40.199
No. They'll always
think of you as a boss first.

16:40.231 --> 16:41.467
Not necessarily.

16:41.501 --> 16:44.207
You can love a boss
like you do a father.

16:44.239 --> 16:45.609
I'm not sure
that ever happens.

16:45.642 --> 16:49.050
Well, okay,
different management styles.

16:49.084 --> 16:50.519
Why can't your workers
be your workers,

16:50.552 --> 16:53.592
family be your family,
your friends be your friends?

16:53.625 --> 16:55.596
Last week, I would've
given a kidney

16:55.629 --> 16:57.800
to anyone in this office.

16:57.832 --> 17:00.172
I would've reached
right into my stomach

17:00.206 --> 17:02.042
and pulled it out
for them.

17:02.042 --> 17:03.345
But now, no.

17:03.377 --> 17:04.614
I don't have
the relationship

17:04.647 --> 17:06.517
with these people
that I thought I did.

17:06.551 --> 17:08.188
I hope they ask.

17:08.221 --> 17:12.563
So they can hear me say,
uh, no.

17:12.595 --> 17:14.567
I only give my organs
to my real friends.

17:14.599 --> 17:18.442
Get yourself
a monkey kidney.

17:18.474 --> 17:19.610
Hey, Brenda,

17:19.644 --> 17:22.616
this is, uh, Jim Halpert
from the boat.

17:22.650 --> 17:25.288
And I got your number
from the corporate directory.

17:25.322 --> 17:27.260
And, well, I was assuming

17:27.292 --> 17:28.695
that you probably
gave it to them

17:28.727 --> 17:31.134
because you wanted me
to ask you out, right?

17:31.168 --> 17:34.607
Um, so give me a call back.

17:34.640 --> 17:37.479
You can get my number
from said directory,

17:37.512 --> 17:40.619
um, or just check
your email

17:40.652 --> 17:43.325
cause I just sent you one.

17:43.357 --> 17:46.398
Yikes. Uh, give me
a call back...

17:46.430 --> 17:48.467
I hope. I'll talk
to you later.

17:48.501 --> 17:51.641
Bye.

17:51.674 --> 17:55.349
You just asked a girl out
on the phone.

17:57.619 --> 17:58.688
Yup.

18:01.428 --> 18:02.162
Yes.

18:02.162 --> 18:03.665
Hello. Yes.

18:03.697 --> 18:06.337
I'm looking for a gay nerd
named Michael Scott.

18:06.371 --> 18:08.641
Who is this?
How did you get this number?

18:08.675 --> 18:10.746
Your mom, you gay nerd.

18:10.778 --> 18:14.520
Oh my God. Packer.
Packster.

18:14.554 --> 18:16.290
Wacky Pack.
How you doing?

18:16.323 --> 18:18.827
Hey, listen, did you get
that package I left for you?

18:18.862 --> 18:20.665
Uh, no.

18:20.699 --> 18:24.307
Did anybody see a package
here today?

18:24.339 --> 18:25.608
No. How big was it?

18:25.641 --> 18:26.610
It was pretty big.

18:26.643 --> 18:27.612
Really?

18:27.645 --> 18:28.815
Yeah.

18:28.847 --> 18:30.752
Did you see
a big package?

18:30.786 --> 18:31.687
Where did you leave it?

18:31.721 --> 18:33.592
Left it in the middle
of your office.

18:33.624 --> 18:35.528
Really. Guys, did you see
a big package

18:35.561 --> 18:36.931
in my office?

18:36.963 --> 18:39.002
You mean the thing?

18:42.709 --> 18:45.349
Are you kidding me?

18:45.382 --> 18:46.751
Oh.

18:46.784 --> 18:47.920
Special delivery.

18:47.953 --> 18:49.489
That was Packer!

18:49.524 --> 18:51.693
Oh, you're--
oh, you are dead.

18:51.727 --> 18:53.365
You are dead, my friend.

18:53.398 --> 18:55.701
That is hilar--
Oh God!

18:55.735 --> 18:57.705
Of course it was you.

18:57.739 --> 18:59.977
Sit on the throne, Michael.

19:00.009 --> 19:02.282
Oh, yeah, yeah!

19:02.282 --> 19:04.719
Oh my God.

19:04.754 --> 19:06.088
It was Packer.

19:06.122 --> 19:07.759
It takes an advanced sense
of humor.

19:07.793 --> 19:09.364
I don't expect everybody
to understand.

19:09.396 --> 19:11.534
It was done out of love
just like I thought.

19:11.567 --> 19:14.540
It's, uh, God,
these people are so--

19:14.573 --> 19:16.678
these are good people.

19:16.711 --> 19:20.352
We have fun.
We just have fun.

19:20.386 --> 19:24.326
Oh, I'm just so sorry
that I threw the thing out.

19:34.111 --> 19:36.451
You have seven
unheard messages.

19:37.486 --> 19:39.524
Hey, Jim. It's Pam.

19:39.557 --> 19:41.428
I keep looking up
to say something to you,

19:41.461 --> 19:42.430
and then Michael's there.

19:42.463 --> 19:43.597
And it's horrible.

19:43.632 --> 19:45.166
Anyway, I'm bored.
Come back.

19:46.538 --> 19:47.672
Hey, guess what.

19:47.705 --> 19:49.843
I moved my computer
so I can't see Michael's head.

19:49.877 --> 19:51.448
It's working.

19:51.481 --> 19:53.652
I think I can have a career
as a very specific

19:53.684 --> 19:54.654
type of decorator.

19:56.188 --> 19:57.660
Sudoku. Level: moderate.
Time: 18 minutes.

19:57.692 --> 19:59.464
Suck on that, Halpert.

20:00.599 --> 20:01.767
I'll transfer you.

20:01.800 --> 20:02.402
Dunder Mifflin,
this is Pam.

20:02.402 --> 20:04.673
Hold, please.

20:04.706 --> 20:06.643
Dunder Mifflin, this is--
Okay, sorry.

20:06.678 --> 20:07.845
Michael was standing
at my desk

20:07.879 --> 20:09.649
and I needed to be busy
or who knows

20:09.684 --> 20:10.652
what would've happened.

20:10.685 --> 20:11.654
So thank you.

20:12.823 --> 20:14.191
Hey, what's that word
we made up

20:14.226 --> 20:16.195
for when you have a thing
stuck in your shoe?

20:16.230 --> 20:18.000
Anyway, I have a thing
stuck in my shoe.

20:19.636 --> 20:21.608
Hey, I have a chance
to sneak out of here early,

20:21.640 --> 20:23.745
and I'm not messing this up
so I'll see you tomorrow.

20:24.846 --> 20:26.081
Calling from my cell phone.

20:26.116 --> 20:27.753
I don't know
if you guys figured out

20:27.785 --> 20:29.154
who did that to Michael's
carpet yet,

20:29.188 --> 20:30.759
but I have a theory
that it involves

20:30.791 --> 20:31.628
an interdepartmental
conspiracy--

20:31.660 --> 20:32.795
everybody in the office.

20:32.830 --> 20:34.833
We need to talk.
