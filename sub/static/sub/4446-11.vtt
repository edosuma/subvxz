12:58.382 --> 12:59.282
Here you go.

12:59.317 --> 13:00.483
Thanks.

13:00.518 --> 13:03.069
Now look at this one, and
look at all the flowers in it.

13:03.091 --> 13:06.825
Here we grow our vegetables. We
have chickens and cows out back.

13:06.884 --> 13:08.819
Cows? You get milk?

13:08.853 --> 13:10.954
Milk, butter, yogurt.

13:10.988 --> 13:13.423
Most importantly for you, penicillin.

13:13.458 --> 13:16.560
Amy makes it herself.
She used to be a chemist.

13:16.594 --> 13:17.878
Lina's in the kitchen.

13:17.880 --> 13:20.532
She'll show you where you can wash up.

13:20.565 --> 13:24.167
And I hope you'll join
us for our mid-day meal.

13:24.202 --> 13:25.569
Thank you.

13:26.437 --> 13:27.871
Thank you.

13:36.147 --> 13:36.646
Oh.

13:37.349 --> 13:43.487
[Laughing] No. It's back,
front, clap, right, then left.

13:43.521 --> 13:46.022
Sorry, I haven't done this in forever.

13:46.057 --> 13:48.525
My mom taught me a really long time ago.

13:48.559 --> 13:50.293
Is she nice?

13:51.763 --> 13:54.431
Yeah, yeah, she is.

13:54.465 --> 13:55.866
Let's try again.

14:03.641 --> 14:07.210
Whoever built this place must've
seen the apocalypse coming.

14:07.245 --> 14:09.479
It's perfect.

14:09.814 --> 14:11.414
That was my husband.

14:11.949 --> 14:14.017
His philosophy was that we become

14:14.051 --> 14:17.420
absolutely self-sufficient
and off the grid.

14:18.356 --> 14:19.723
Your husband?

14:21.025 --> 14:22.592
He's gone.

14:22.960 --> 14:24.161
Like the others.

14:26.564 --> 14:28.064
All these women?

14:30.368 --> 14:33.036
Well Zina and Emmeline
were my sister wives.

14:34.438 --> 14:39.376
And when Ammon went, we had
each other and this place.

14:42.914 --> 14:47.350
These other women weren't
so lucky 'til we found them.

14:48.452 --> 14:49.920
Now they're safe.

14:49.954 --> 14:51.721
They're free.

14:52.323 --> 14:53.757
More strawberries?

14:54.425 --> 14:56.560
No. I...

14:56.594 --> 14:58.862
I think I'm gonna go look in on Cassandra

14:58.896 --> 15:00.330
and see how she's doing.

15:01.098 --> 15:01.998
Thank you.

15:02.033 --> 15:03.433
Of course.

15:05.970 --> 15:08.638
So these are the carrots
you grew? They're delicious.

15:09.574 --> 15:10.240
[Knock, knock]

15:11.309 --> 15:12.876
Feeling better? Thank you.

15:12.910 --> 15:14.077

15:19.984 --> 15:23.053
Remember what Sam told us
about where he was going?

15:23.087 --> 15:24.921
Salt Lake City to see his dad.

15:25.823 --> 15:28.191
Amy has a son a little older than Sam.

15:28.326 --> 15:29.893
He's not here.

15:30.261 --> 15:31.494
You know why?

15:33.664 --> 15:35.632
Went to Salt Lake City to see his dad?

15:38.202 --> 15:40.503
The girls stay here, but all the boys leave

15:40.538 --> 15:43.573
when they turn 13. That's what she said.

15:45.877 --> 15:48.044
They seem so happy.

15:48.079 --> 15:50.780
Yeah, maybe a little too happy.

15:52.083 --> 15:54.551
Nice people always scare me.

15:54.919 --> 15:58.288
Let's get you well, and
let's get out of here.

16:06.030 --> 16:09.499
All these women give me the creeps.

16:09.533 --> 16:12.135
That blonde one keeps looking at me.

16:12.169 --> 16:14.504
Oh man, don't get down
on yourself like that.

16:14.538 --> 16:16.473
You are a perfect hunk of man meat,

16:16.507 --> 16:17.874
and don't you ever forget it.

16:17.909 --> 16:19.876
Ha, ha. Don't quit your day job.

16:22.380 --> 16:24.114
Is there really all women in there?

16:24.148 --> 16:26.316
Yeah. Enjoy your imagination, kid.

16:26.350 --> 16:27.984
That's probably all you're gonna get.

16:30.254 --> 16:31.955
You know what I don't understand, Doc?

16:32.623 --> 16:34.991
What the hell happened to all their men?

16:36.294 --> 16:37.961
Well maybe we can ask her.

16:39.130 --> 16:41.064
Angels from heaven.

16:41.465 --> 16:42.966
Is that pie?

16:43.334 --> 16:47.103
Blueberry. Ummm, I, I, I made it by myself.

16:47.138 --> 16:49.306

it all. Now you're here.

27:15.084 --> 27:18.987
You don't want to get in my way, sister.

27:21.023 --> 27:23.758
Please, I... I swear. I swear.
I wasn't gonna do anything.

27:23.793 --> 27:25.226
He's lying.

27:27.229 --> 27:29.431
[Whispering] Remember the cannibal.
Remember when he kidnapped you.

27:30.466 --> 27:33.234
[Screaming]

27:33.335 --> 27:34.469
[Whispering]

27:35.504 --> 27:37.772
[Screaming]

27:37.807 --> 27:38.773
[Whispering] Remember.

27:39.809 --> 27:42.510
[Taser clicking]

27:42.545 --> 27:43.778
[Whispering] Remember Tobias.

27:44.614 --> 27:46.748
- [Crying]
- Remember when he kidnapped you.

27:46.773 --> 27:47.583
Remember.

27:48.284 --> 27:49.150
[Gunshot]

27:52.454 --> 27:55.322
Oh, God! No! No! No!

27:58.327 --> 27:59.794
Good girl.

28:04.467 --> 28:06.334
It's time to go.

28:13.830 --> 28:17.399
[Growling]

28:17.434 --> 28:18.834
[Munching]

28:18.868 --> 28:20.302
[Screaming]

28:37.921 --> 28:38.919
We got to get out of here.

28:38.921 --> 28:40.673
Hey, I know. I saw the bear.

28:40.707 --> 28:42.007
That's not the problem.

28:42.042 --> 28:44.543
If a zombie bear isn't
the problem, what is?

28:48.214 --> 28:49.448
I need to see her.

28:49.482 --> 28:50.582
She's in a weird place.

28:50.617 --> 28:53.218
I've been there. It's not
gonna be easy to get her back.

28:53.253 --> 28:55.654
Well it's fine, but I'm not
leaving here without her.

28:57.924 --> 28:59.658
You guys just get ready.

29:00.060 --> 29:02.795
I'll do my best to get her out.

29:02.829 --> 29:05.230
But you may have a choice to make.

29:10.837 --> 29:13.605
I know what you did seemed hard.

29:15.575 --> 29:19.845
I felt the same way when I
freed myself from my husband.

29:21.114 --> 29:23.582
He said he was innocent, too.

29:24.417 --> 29:26.685
You know we were both raised to

29:26.720 --> 29:29.154
believe all the rules, that

29:29.189 --> 29:31.924
they were good and true and

29:32.892 --> 29:34.993
from God.

29:35.962 --> 29:39.698
And after I almost died
after my fifth child,

29:39.733 --> 29:42.534
I started not to believe.

29:43.103 --> 29:46.538
I didn't want anymore children.

29:46.573 --> 29:48.540
I didn't want him.

29:49.242 --> 29:51.877
And that didn't square with the rules.

29:52.247 --> 29:55.839
So he beat me.

29:58.551 --> 30:02.121
He broke my nose and my arms, ribs.

30:03.490 --> 30:05.292
But that's not even the worst story

30:05.294 --> 30:08.060
that you'll hear from the women in here.

30:08.661 --> 30:09.495
Hey.

30:09.963 --> 30:11.563
<i>We got to go now.</i>

30:14.033 --> 30:15.367
You seen Addy?

30:15.402 --> 30:16.368
No.

30:17.103 --> 30:19.838
We will find her on the way out.

30:23.376 --> 30:25.177
I'll be fine.

30:25.812 --> 30:27.079
Hope so.

30:27.113 --> 30:28.514
I will.

30:33.820 --> 30:38.290
You've been out there.
You know what it's like.

30:38.324 --> 30:42.428
I just... don't know

30:43.263 --> 30:45.764
what I'm supposed to do anymore.

30:49.202 --> 30:51.370
I can't un-see any of it.

30:51.704 --> 30:53.272
The people,

30:53.306 --> 30:55.607
even the zombies.

30:56.309 --> 30:58.043
It's too much

30:58.077 --> 30:59.711
for anyone.

31:02.282 --> 31:04.616
You need rest.

31:06.186 --> 31:07.953
Peace.

31:09.055 --> 31:10.856
Stay here.

31:11.691 --> 31:13.826
Be a part of our family.

31:15.261 --> 31:17.496
I can't leave Mack.

31:18.031 --> 31:20.265
I can't.

31:21.167 --> 31:22.868
I love him.

31:23.603 --> 31:26.138
I know you do, sweetheart.

31:26.973 --> 31:31.009
So it'll hurt all that much more
when you have to watch him die.

31:32.979 --> 31:35.414
And one day he will die.

31:35.782 --> 31:38.150
And it will be you

31:38.518 --> 31:41.253
that has to give him mercy.

31:49.696 --> 31:50.929
[Crying] Yeah.

31:56.169 --> 31:57.970
How do I tell him?

31:58.705 --> 32:01.039
What do I say?

32:02.409 --> 32:04.276
I'll tell you what to say.

32:05.979 --> 32:07.412
[Whispering] Okay.

32:10.229 --> 32:11.231
Addy?

32:11.272 --> 32:12.572
Hey.

32:14.442 --> 32:15.475
Hey.

32:17.545 --> 32:20.547
Hey, can we go talk somewhere real quick?

32:20.748 --> 32:23.851
Uh, yeah. Yeah, of course.

32:23.876 --> 32:25.076
Okay.

32:27.021 --> 32:28.989
<i>(Mack) So what's it like in there?</i>

32:30.358 --> 32:32.521
Sounds a little weird, I mean a zombie...

32:32.523 --> 32:35.728
Uh, no, no, no, no, no. Mack, it is...

32:35.730 --> 32:38.398
It's so beautiful.

32:39.767 --> 32:41.768
I wish you could see it.

32:41.769 --> 32:44.304
Yeah, I wish I could too.

32:44.338 --> 32:47.941
It's so different from out here.

32:49.243 --> 32:51.244
I feel safe.

32:51.979 --> 32:54.481
I haven't felt that in such a long time.

32:56.417 --> 32:59.052
Good. That's good.

32:59.420 --> 33:02.255
I'm glad. It's...

33:02.923 --> 33:06.126
I'm sure it's gonna be hard to leave.

33:08.829 --> 33:11.598
That's what I wanted to talk to you about.

33:17.104 --> 33:19.305
It's too much.

33:21.409 --> 33:23.509
I can't do it anymore, Mack.

33:23.811 --> 33:25.411
But Addy...

33:26.414 --> 33:29.816
I can't stay with you here.

33:33.254 --> 33:35.355
I need to rest.

33:36.157 --> 33:38.073
I can't.

33:38.075 --> 33:39.620
I can't do this without you.

33:42.168 --> 33:46.543
No. No, no, no, no, no, no.
Addy... Addy, come on. Come on.

33:47.710 --> 33:51.680
I love you. I... I... Don't you...

33:51.714 --> 33:55.117
Mack, I love you so much.

33:57.854 --> 34:00.689
I cannot go back out
there and watch you die.

34:00.723 --> 34:01.823
I'm not gonna die.

34:01.858 --> 34:03.291
Yes, you will.

34:03.326 --> 34:05.327
We all will.

34:06.763 --> 34:10.431
And this is how I want to remember you.

34:12.568 --> 34:16.138
Mack, I cannot kill
somebody I love ever again.

34:16.172 --> 34:18.340
I'm not going back out
there without you, Addy.

34:18.373 --> 34:19.341
I'm not. I can't.

34:19.375 --> 34:20.842
This is for the best.

34:20.877 --> 34:23.110
Addy. Addy, wait. Wait a minute.

34:23.446 --> 34:25.547
What about Murphy, huh?

34:26.549 --> 34:28.049
And the mission?

34:29.185 --> 34:31.652
You said, you said you would rather

34:31.687 --> 34:35.524
die believing in something
than live believing in nothing.

34:35.558 --> 34:36.992
I have to go.

34:37.592 --> 34:40.762
Look at me. Look at me.

34:40.797 --> 34:45.300
I understand. I do. You're...

34:45.333 --> 34:47.835
You're upset about your
mom. Of course. Of course.

34:47.870 --> 34:50.605
It's horrible. I mean
it's, it's beyond horrible.

34:51.040 --> 34:53.475
But you're gonna get through this.

34:55.143 --> 34:56.777
That's not who you are.

34:57.647 --> 35:01.817
You're a good person.
You're, you're, you're strong.

35:02.251 --> 35:04.419
You're strong. You don't need

35:04.554 --> 35:05.754
Helen

35:05.988 --> 35:08.356
and some stupid cult.

35:09.625 --> 35:11.293
I'm sorry.

35:11.694 --> 35:13.728
Addy, Addy, Addy. You can't do this.

35:13.763 --> 35:15.263
- Mack.
- You can't leave me. This is crazy.

35:15.298 --> 35:15.797
Mack.

35:15.799 --> 35:16.491
Addy, wait.

35:16.493 --> 35:17.320
Mack, let me go.

35:17.322 --> 35:19.267
Addy, just listen to me.
Just listen to me, okay?

35:19.302 --> 35:20.435
- Mack.
- You're not thinking clearly.

35:20.470 --> 35:22.103
You're hurting me!

Wait. Addy.

Please talk to us!

Come on, Addy!

36:01.251 --> 36:03.051
<i>(Helen) Maybe I could help?</i>

36:03.887 --> 36:06.188
I think we've had enough of your help.

36:08.158 --> 36:08.991
Addy?

36:09.025 --> 36:09.792
[Knocking on door]

36:10.494 --> 36:11.627
It's me.

36:11.661 --> 36:13.262
Open the door.

36:15.098 --> 36:16.098
Addy?

36:16.466 --> 36:17.666
Don't touch me.

36:25.742 --> 36:34.697
[Chain rattling]

36:37.601 --> 36:39.160
Where's Murphy? We need the tent.

36:39.162 --> 36:41.938
Uh, he's still in it with that girl.

36:41.972 --> 36:43.873
She's still in there?

36:48.579 --> 36:51.781
Party's over, everyone. Time to go.

36:53.584 --> 36:55.051
Where'd you get a cigarette?

36:55.085 --> 36:57.187
Whatever daddy needs,

36:58.055 --> 36:59.389
daddy gets.

36:59.423 --> 37:01.324
Yeah, well time to go now, sweetheart.

37:01.358 --> 37:04.027
Come on. Up and at 'em.

37:06.730 --> 37:08.031
Thanks, man.

37:08.065 --> 37:09.799
Thought she'd never leave.

37:20.377 --> 37:22.212
Surprise.

37:26.450 --> 37:27.917
Go ahead. Tell them.

37:27.952 --> 37:29.986
Tell them what you told me.

37:31.021 --> 37:33.256
I've made up my mind.

37:33.891 --> 37:35.458
I'm gonna stay here

37:35.492 --> 37:36.325
with Helen.

37:36.327 --> 37:38.294
No. Addy.

37:38.329 --> 37:40.329
Trouble at the gate. We need you.

37:40.398 --> 37:42.765
You stay here. You'll be safe.

37:45.469 --> 37:47.403
Addy, I know this place feels safe.

37:47.738 --> 37:49.272
It feels good.

37:50.608 --> 37:53.276
Well that's how I felt when I met Tobias.

37:53.310 --> 37:54.944
But it wasn't real.

37:54.979 --> 37:56.079
You and me,

37:56.113 --> 37:59.415
we've been through so much together.

37:59.617 --> 38:01.150
<i>(Warren) Addison Carver.</i>

38:02.019 --> 38:04.387
Listen to me.

38:04.655 --> 38:06.055
Enough now.

38:06.957 --> 38:09.726
<i>You got sucked into this thing,</i>

38:10.127 --> 38:11.794
and you did something.

You don't have to worry.

I'm home now.

38:32.149 --> 38:33.449
No.

How'd she get outside?

38:45.996 --> 38:46.796
Where is she?!

The tall one?

Your leader?

I'm here! What do you want?

38:53.504 --> 38:55.271
You, sweetheart.

38:55.306 --> 38:57.407
I want you.

38:58.042 --> 38:59.609
You open that gate

38:59.977 --> 39:01.811
and you come out here.

39:01.845 --> 39:05.081
And we'll have a nice little conversation.

Yes, she's coming.
