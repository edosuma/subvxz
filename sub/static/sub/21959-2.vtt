00:06.313 --> 00:07.812
Previously, on Bad Blood...

00:07.837 --> 00:10.306
Now what I'm proposing is a cooperative.

00:10.465 --> 00:11.798
But there can only be one CEO.

00:11.866 --> 00:14.133
Because I own something
that none of you do.

00:14.202 --> 00:15.701
City Hall and the cops.

00:15.770 --> 00:17.403
They came in to my house, Gilles.

00:17.471 --> 00:19.138
These two punk nobodies.

00:19.207 --> 00:20.539
My whole family was in.

00:20.608 --> 00:23.109
I want to legitimize our
interests across the board.

00:23.178 --> 00:24.543
Slowly pull back.

00:24.612 --> 00:26.257
He gets to know all your
secrets, but I'm your son.

00:26.281 --> 00:27.324
You don't get to know my secrets,

00:27.348 --> 00:28.781
'cause I don't want you to.

00:28.850 --> 00:30.961
- Declan's on the front line.
- Why should I tell you?

00:30.985 --> 00:32.284
Because it's my job to ask.

00:32.353 --> 00:34.553
My friend Josee, she
saw some 20-year-old

00:34.578 --> 00:35.718
getting into your limo.

00:35.742 --> 00:37.271
I've accepted that I may stay your

00:37.283 --> 00:38.959
mistress for the rest of our lives.

00:40.257 --> 00:41.193
Mr. Rizzuto?

00:41.218 --> 00:43.507
This is an extradition order from the

00:43.519 --> 00:45.695
United States Justice Department.

00:46.055 --> 00:47.788
We're here to place you under arrest.

00:47.813 --> 00:49.274
From now on, I'm in on every meeting.

00:49.298 --> 00:50.507
I've got things covered, Nico.

00:50.532 --> 00:52.145
Someone from the family needs
to be in charge.

00:52.169 --> 00:53.435
Declan is family.

00:53.460 --> 00:55.062
Vito got 10 years.

00:55.328 --> 00:56.727
The judge sent him all the way

00:56.796 --> 00:58.696
to Colorado Federal Penitentiary

00:58.764 --> 01:00.750
just so he wouldn't be near any of us.

01:48.067 --> 01:51.335
If any major
organization loses its CEO,

01:51.722 --> 01:54.290
confidence from its
partners and investors

01:54.506 --> 01:56.306
is bound to be a little shaky, right?

01:58.515 --> 02:02.171
But a well-run organization,
it knows not to panic.

02:02.556 --> 02:05.290
It's just a little turbulence.
You ride it out.

02:07.398 --> 02:09.038
Vito left me in charge.

02:09.687 --> 02:11.664
No one had any issues with that.

02:12.057 --> 02:15.558
And things would have been just
fine, if not for the little prince.

02:15.867 --> 02:19.095
Nico Junior decided that he
should be the one to take over,

02:19.163 --> 02:21.953
even though his old man
told him to stay out of it.

02:22.001 --> 02:23.101
Hey!

02:23.625 --> 02:25.325
I believe we have
some business to discuss.

02:25.394 --> 02:26.929
No, we had that discussion.

02:27.071 --> 02:30.005
I told you I'm not paying anymore,
then I hung up the phone.

02:30.531 --> 02:31.798
Now piss off, junior.

02:31.867 --> 02:33.611
They never would have said that to me

02:33.635 --> 02:35.210
or anyone from our crew.

02:35.281 --> 02:37.401
They figured the kid wasn't
gonna to do much about it.

02:37.796 --> 02:39.738
But this wasn't just anyone's kid.

02:39.807 --> 02:42.008
His mentors weren't exactly priests.

02:42.076 --> 02:43.328
Come on!

02:55.289 --> 02:57.456
All right! How do I unlock this?

02:57.525 --> 02:58.857
Ah!

03:03.132 --> 03:05.864
- What the fuck is that?
- That's gasoline, man.

03:10.771 --> 03:12.237
Acting like a psychopath,

03:12.305 --> 03:13.872
just to prove he should be the boss,

03:13.941 --> 03:15.908
set off a chain reaction
throughout the city.

03:15.976 --> 03:18.209
So to say things went crazy
in the first couple months

03:18.278 --> 03:21.079
when Vito got locked up, that
would be a great understatement.

03:21.489 --> 03:23.281
Everyone went to war.

03:24.051 --> 03:25.650
Crews came after us.

03:25.974 --> 03:27.752
The bikers went after the Irish.

03:28.279 --> 03:30.005
Irish went after Haitians.

03:30.411 --> 03:33.858
A total domino effect
of shit for brains panic.

03:33.927 --> 03:35.860
And you know what they were doing?

03:35.929 --> 03:39.063
They were all trying to rip
each other's faces right off.

03:59.170 --> 04:00.610
What the hell's wrong with that kid?

04:03.222 --> 04:06.404
Declan, look, I know
you can handle the operations,

04:06.758 --> 04:08.158
but that kid is gonna burn down

04:08.227 --> 04:09.493
the whole goddamn city

04:09.562 --> 04:11.395
if that's how he's gonna handle things.

04:11.464 --> 04:12.880
I'll get Nico under control.

04:15.734 --> 04:17.000
How are the Irish taking this?

04:17.069 --> 04:18.635
I'm into it with them right now.

04:18.704 --> 04:21.269
Mick, he's in the dark
about the whole thing.

04:21.339 --> 04:22.619
His guys did it behind his back.

04:23.041 --> 04:24.107
Now...

04:24.175 --> 04:26.114
The investigation into the car fire?

04:26.489 --> 04:28.456
I'll take care of it, that's
going nowhere, don't worry.

04:28.480 --> 04:29.482
Yeah?

04:30.232 --> 04:31.255
Listen...

04:31.968 --> 04:34.771
I knew there'd be a period
of adjustment when Vito left,

04:35.529 --> 04:37.169
but you need to control things.

04:37.623 --> 04:39.000
If people don't know
who they're dealing with,

04:39.024 --> 04:40.556
they'll think nobody's in charge.

04:42.594 --> 04:44.060
Little extra for your trouble.

05:07.169 --> 05:09.352
I have to go deal
with this Cambodian prick.

05:09.420 --> 05:11.966
We got the whole block
except for this one jerk.

05:12.557 --> 05:14.023
Don't break his nose.

05:14.091 --> 05:15.358
Not another nose.

05:15.426 --> 05:17.154
Definitely gonna break his nose.

05:17.405 --> 05:19.364
They are starting to call you the nose.

05:19.764 --> 05:21.169
- Who?
- People.

05:21.466 --> 05:22.498
People? What people?

05:22.567 --> 05:23.989
- People!
- Give it to me.

05:24.068 --> 05:25.068
You?

05:26.971 --> 05:28.037
All right!

05:28.388 --> 05:30.272
Go get me a sandwich and it's yours.

05:30.427 --> 05:32.841
What, I'm buying you lunch
to let me do your job?

05:32.910 --> 05:34.271
That's what we do, isn't it?

05:34.302 --> 05:36.630
People pay us money, we let
them run their business.

05:36.724 --> 05:39.614
And if they don't pay us money,
we screw with their lives.

05:40.017 --> 05:41.050
He has a point.

05:41.118 --> 05:43.852
Yeah! Oh, and extra cheese.

05:43.921 --> 05:46.689
And tell them not to skimp on the fries.

05:46.757 --> 05:48.050
It's a goddamn potato.

05:48.075 --> 05:49.591
What does it cost, three cents?

05:49.660 --> 05:51.693
And the satisfaction
it brings its customers,

05:51.761 --> 05:53.029
it's worth the expense.

05:53.054 --> 05:55.214
I'll be sure to bring up
restaurant economics with 'em.

05:56.599 --> 05:57.732
Yeah.

05:57.801 --> 06:00.234
And a Pepsi too, smart ass!

06:09.112 --> 06:10.945
How can there be no record of this?

06:12.709 --> 06:15.244
Yes, they're right outside
my restaurant right now!

06:16.820 --> 06:18.752
Of course I'm sure!

06:20.243 --> 06:21.458
Got a light?

06:25.932 --> 06:27.197
Thanks.

06:32.838 --> 06:34.137
You okay?

06:37.072 --> 06:38.380
Can you believe this?

06:39.318 --> 06:42.443
The city has no idea
what they're doing here

06:42.468 --> 06:43.794
or how it's gonna take.

06:44.638 --> 06:45.946
They have no record.

06:46.216 --> 06:47.224
I know.

06:47.249 --> 06:49.622
Dealing with the city
can be a nightmare, I know.

06:50.185 --> 06:51.638
I pay my taxes.

06:52.091 --> 06:53.887
They are supposed to work for me.

06:53.956 --> 06:55.756
That's how it's supposed to be.

06:56.005 --> 06:59.060
I've got people, friends
who work for the City Hall,

06:59.085 --> 07:00.451
I can make a call for you.

07:01.974 --> 07:04.297
- Really?
- Really, it's just a phone call.

07:04.491 --> 07:05.656
We're neighbors.

07:10.505 --> 07:12.247
You work for the gangsters.

07:13.332 --> 07:14.931
I work for the neighborhood.

07:17.529 --> 07:18.888
You don't scare me.

07:19.083 --> 07:21.184
I grew up in a country where my friends

07:21.196 --> 07:23.115
get killed, they get
shot in the street.

07:24.130 --> 07:25.294
You don't scare me.

07:26.263 --> 07:27.820
I am not gonna pay you.

07:28.677 --> 07:32.318
Mr. Ling, you're looking
at this the wrong way.

07:32.594 --> 07:37.458
Me, and the people I work for,
we so admire people like you

07:37.591 --> 07:40.177
who come to a country with nothing,

07:40.521 --> 07:43.636
and they, they, they learn a new
language, they have to start over

07:43.705 --> 07:45.271
and build a life.

07:45.548 --> 07:48.411
And that life needs to be protected.

07:49.943 --> 07:51.443
Me and the people I work for,

07:51.512 --> 07:55.013
if you, if you have
any problems, with anything,

07:55.081 --> 07:57.716
a permit, the city,
a dog who's barking so loud

07:57.785 --> 08:01.841
you can't even nap on a Sunday
afternoon, you call me.

08:02.714 --> 08:04.047
And I'll take care of it.

08:04.525 --> 08:05.630
Okay?

08:06.193 --> 08:08.993
Because I'm your representative.

08:10.399 --> 08:11.931
I work for you.

08:32.618 --> 08:34.052
Good afternoon, Mr. Rizzuto.

08:35.121 --> 08:36.388
- Declan?
- Yeah.

08:37.607 --> 08:39.645
- Irish, right?
- Yeah, rumor has it.

08:40.871 --> 08:42.714
I wanted some face to face with you

08:42.739 --> 08:44.005
because I hear you've been
doing some good things.

08:44.029 --> 08:45.693
- Thank you, sir.
- All right.

08:46.298 --> 08:48.943
So I gotta take care of this one thing.
You listen, don't talk.

08:49.521 --> 08:50.904
Good job with the Cambodian.

08:50.929 --> 08:52.850
One more broken nose
and I was gonna have a mutiny.

08:52.874 --> 08:54.458
- He's actually Chinese.
- Whatever.

08:57.569 --> 08:58.755
Good burger, huh?

09:00.975 --> 09:04.376
The secret is that they, uh,
they bake the buns right here.

09:04.570 --> 09:05.769
Makes all the difference.

09:07.185 --> 09:09.669
So, I'm sorry to interrupt
your lunch, Mr. Desjardins,

09:10.121 --> 09:11.849
I know you only got like 15 minutes.

09:11.966 --> 09:13.880
I just wanted to let you know that the

09:13.905 --> 09:16.125
new minivan, that you just leased...

09:17.060 --> 09:18.926
It's paid up, in full.

09:19.168 --> 09:20.367
It's yours.

09:21.132 --> 09:25.622
Your two boys, Mark and Luke,
they play hockey right?

09:27.577 --> 09:30.345
- Yeah. Uh-huh.
- Lots of room for gear in the back.

09:31.342 --> 09:33.786
You know... You know who I am, right?

09:35.446 --> 09:36.446
Yes.

09:37.114 --> 09:41.286
I just want you to memorize
these four company names.

09:42.220 --> 09:45.027
Because on Friday morning,
you're gonna receive bids

09:45.052 --> 09:47.029
for the Eastend snow removal contract,

09:47.357 --> 09:50.225
and these four companies are who
you're gonna give the bid to.

09:56.451 --> 09:57.684
Do you understand me?

09:58.872 --> 10:00.060
- Yeah.
- Right.

10:00.401 --> 10:02.301
I want you to memorize those four names.

10:03.896 --> 10:04.997
All right?

10:05.593 --> 10:08.060
Don't let your burger
get cold, it's very important.

10:14.466 --> 10:15.851
You wanna know what I do?

10:16.310 --> 10:18.708
I size people up. That's it.

10:19.121 --> 10:21.864
But I size them up fast
and I size them up right.

10:23.052 --> 10:25.593
You push too hard, you cause
problems for yourself.

10:25.997 --> 10:28.596
You push too little,
people think you're soft.

10:29.005 --> 10:31.216
- They can take what's yours.
- Yeah.

10:31.841 --> 10:35.216
But, in you, I see
someone who has that ability.

10:35.802 --> 10:38.638
I'm gonna do great things in this
town but I'm gonna need help.

10:39.141 --> 10:40.739
I can buy muscle all day long.

10:41.622 --> 10:42.927
But instinct...

10:43.857 --> 10:46.525
That's something you gotta
nurture if you come across it.

10:47.989 --> 10:50.911
- You ready to work?
- Yes, sir. Yeah.

10:58.570 --> 10:59.602
You look good.

11:01.186 --> 11:02.779
I look like shit.

11:06.060 --> 11:07.467
What the hell's going on?

11:07.536 --> 11:08.936
It's like you said it would happen.

11:09.004 --> 11:10.537
They're coming at us from all sides.

11:10.606 --> 11:11.838
I'm talking about my son.

11:11.907 --> 11:13.439
I'll get to that other stuff later.

11:13.509 --> 11:16.142
Some of Mick's guys figured
they'd go out on their own.

11:16.211 --> 11:17.630
So they went to Nico directly.

11:17.655 --> 11:19.054
They thought he'd be soft.

11:19.214 --> 11:20.454
Why are they even going to him?

11:20.516 --> 11:22.136
'Cause he's, he's gettin' it out there

11:22.161 --> 11:23.443
that he's heir to the throne.

11:24.497 --> 11:27.833
Look, I know he's stubborn,
but you gotta make him stop.

11:27.910 --> 11:29.209
- I will.
- Declan.

11:30.505 --> 11:32.380
I don't want him involved in this.

11:32.568 --> 11:33.888
It's a priority.

11:34.719 --> 11:37.353
As for this other shitstorm
that's going on,

11:37.575 --> 11:39.442
you know if they think there's a split,

11:39.467 --> 11:41.767
they're all gonna panic,
just like they're doing.

11:41.836 --> 11:43.013
Right.

11:43.371 --> 11:46.482
What you need to give
them, is a pacifier.

11:47.177 --> 11:48.591
Don't let them cry it out.

11:49.357 --> 11:50.743
You gotta give them something.

11:50.998 --> 11:51.998
Right?

11:52.637 --> 11:54.103
You have to take the lead.

11:56.583 --> 11:58.380
Show them you're in charge.

11:59.431 --> 12:02.131
The number one priority, right now,

12:03.107 --> 12:05.624
is to focus on the family.

12:05.693 --> 12:06.859
Yeah.

12:07.122 --> 12:08.761
Taking care of the family.

12:08.829 --> 12:10.489
Taking care of my son.

12:11.138 --> 12:12.165
Yeah.

12:12.233 --> 12:13.497
You can count on me.

12:15.206 --> 12:16.472
Thank you.

12:29.021 --> 12:30.208
We're stalled.

12:30.358 --> 12:31.891
One of our financiers backed out,

12:31.960 --> 12:34.825
and that delay caused us to
miss a couple of deadlines.

12:35.067 --> 12:36.767
Now we're backed up with permits.

12:36.931 --> 12:39.599
I can't get anyone at City Hall
to move on this either way.

12:39.841 --> 12:41.262
I'd nowhere else to turn to because

12:41.287 --> 12:43.310
your father used to deal
with all this, but...

12:51.257 --> 12:52.390
Yeah.

12:56.443 --> 12:57.548
So?

12:57.803 --> 12:58.927
Can you fix it?

13:02.161 --> 13:04.597
I know the usual commission is 2.5%,

13:04.622 --> 13:08.239
but given the present climate and
market volatility in our business,

13:09.239 --> 13:10.841
you'll have to go up to three and half.

13:11.164 --> 13:13.630
No, this is an equity deal.

13:14.036 --> 13:16.091
Your father's in for 10% of the whole.

13:16.177 --> 13:18.780
Hmm... If everything
proceeds without a hitch,

13:18.804 --> 13:22.310
it's gonna take you
two, three years to finish.

13:23.161 --> 13:25.779
Another year after that
to sell 75% of the units.

13:27.200 --> 13:30.294
So we're not looking
at a return for four years.

13:31.183 --> 13:33.384
That's how equity usually works, yeah.

13:33.452 --> 13:36.169
I know how it works. I'm a developer.

13:37.161 --> 13:38.288
Look.

13:38.357 --> 13:41.214
This is a deal I made with
your father, he asked for it.

13:41.239 --> 13:43.894
I understand that but I have to
deal with the realities of today.

13:43.919 --> 13:46.208
It's gonna take a lot of money,
to get you back on track.

13:47.060 --> 13:48.388
I can't wait four years.

13:48.872 --> 13:49.958
Nico, please.

13:50.187 --> 13:53.622
With all due respect, I don't think
you understand how this works.

13:54.607 --> 13:56.089
When your father took a commission,

13:56.114 --> 13:59.364
I factored that into the cost
and I made my bid accordingly.

13:59.852 --> 14:01.485
We're way past that now.

14:01.679 --> 14:03.914
I can't raise the price
of the whole project 3.5%

14:03.982 --> 14:07.083
and pay off all the engineers and
all the other idiots after that.

14:07.152 --> 14:08.985
Vito took care of that for his 10%.

14:09.054 --> 14:11.288
I will lose money if I go
to commission with you.

14:11.356 --> 14:13.001
I have to ensure
that we maintain the cash flow

14:13.025 --> 14:15.396
required to keep businesses
like yours alive.

14:15.732 --> 14:17.394
If you do not accept our offer,

14:17.462 --> 14:20.297
I will make certain that you will
not see one permit approved.

14:20.365 --> 14:22.399
The whole thing will
sit here for 1,000 years

14:22.467 --> 14:25.135
and this rotting pile of shit
will be your legacy.

14:26.471 --> 14:27.685
Kiss my ass.

14:29.916 --> 14:30.916
Hank!

14:32.786 --> 14:34.271
Why don't you take the night?

14:34.716 --> 14:37.575
- Think on it.
- No, thanks. I got other options.

14:38.114 --> 14:39.281
You know what?

14:39.350 --> 14:41.083
I came here outta respect
for your father.

14:41.328 --> 14:42.560
But you...

14:42.585 --> 14:44.385
You're no Vito, that's for damn sure!

15:09.952 --> 15:11.279
Fuck!

15:12.327 --> 15:13.646
I feel so guilty.

15:17.289 --> 15:21.057
He's the one in prison and I'm the
one having a hard time coping.

15:22.943 --> 15:24.325
I can't sleep.

15:25.777 --> 15:28.849
I know this is triggering
my abandonment issues.

15:32.161 --> 15:33.380
But it's like...

15:34.575 --> 15:37.466
I finally got comfortable
with the choices I've made,

15:37.491 --> 15:38.560
and...

15:39.393 --> 15:41.146
And he's taken away from me.

15:44.445 --> 15:46.411
And I have to start all over again.

15:53.595 --> 15:55.628
He's gonna be gone for years.

16:03.818 --> 16:05.700
- You're following me?
- No.

16:05.901 --> 16:07.134
Gio's following you.

16:07.202 --> 16:08.669
He told me where you're at.

16:08.986 --> 16:10.552
Hey, hey, hey.

16:10.739 --> 16:13.239
Come one, we'll protect you,
you know how this works.

16:14.154 --> 16:16.009
I don't want him to know about this.

16:16.034 --> 16:17.099
Let's go talk.

16:18.630 --> 16:19.794
Come on.

16:20.325 --> 16:22.248
You can't see your therapist anymore.

16:22.273 --> 16:23.536
You can't tell me that.

16:23.561 --> 16:25.791
- Michelle... Michelle...
- No, don't...

16:25.856 --> 16:28.217
Don't give me that shit, Declan.

16:29.052 --> 16:31.583
- No one's ever had to worry about me.
- I know.

16:32.184 --> 16:34.885
I'm the best mistress
anyone could ever hope for.

16:36.357 --> 16:39.575
He can trust me just as much as you.
And he knows it.

16:40.497 --> 16:44.202
And... I'm not ashamed of getting help.

16:44.271 --> 16:45.870
- No...
- She's a doctor.

16:45.939 --> 16:47.872
Yeah, I know, there's
nothing to be ashamed of.

16:47.941 --> 16:50.442
I mean, God knows we could all
use a little more mental help.

16:50.510 --> 16:52.021
She just can't be trusted.

16:52.450 --> 16:53.911
She's a doctor.

16:54.013 --> 16:55.247
She's a person.

16:55.748 --> 16:58.849
And Michelle, you don't
know anything about her.

16:59.029 --> 17:02.319
The feds, they could go after her.

17:02.388 --> 17:05.011
Or threaten her family with things,

17:05.036 --> 17:07.473
a thousand things, unless
she gave them something.

17:07.727 --> 17:09.237
No one fights fair
in our world, you know.

17:09.261 --> 17:12.630
I'm not stupid. I don't tell
her anything about Vito.

17:15.902 --> 17:17.801
Conversations are over with her.

17:20.558 --> 17:22.012
Who am I supposed to talk to?

17:23.622 --> 17:25.009
And don't say you.

17:25.340 --> 17:28.357
Emotional intelligence is
not high up on your resume.

17:29.083 --> 17:30.568
You might be surprised.

17:31.435 --> 17:34.607
I trust two people to keep my secrets.

17:35.333 --> 17:37.421
God, and my mirror.

17:40.505 --> 17:42.255
- Wow.
- Yeah.

17:57.909 --> 17:59.776
- Hey, Vito!
- Yeah, come on.

18:01.083 --> 18:02.513
Want a cappuccino?

18:02.581 --> 18:03.879
Ah, no thanks.

18:03.948 --> 18:05.357
I thought we were having a meeting?

18:05.411 --> 18:07.247
Yeah, I wanted to see you alone.

18:07.947 --> 18:09.896
- Gio.
- Yeah, sure.

18:10.716 --> 18:11.863
I can come back.

18:11.888 --> 18:13.523
Just a minute. Come, stand here.

18:13.591 --> 18:14.997
Right here? Why?

18:16.023 --> 18:17.756
Well, I heard it was your birthday.

18:18.755 --> 18:20.114
This is your present.

18:20.698 --> 18:22.665
Mauro's the finest tailor I've ever met

18:22.733 --> 18:24.311
and I've had suits
made all over the world.

18:24.335 --> 18:25.868
Uh, I'm not really a suit guy.

18:25.936 --> 18:29.705
Hey, every man of standing
needs to have a proper suit.

18:29.774 --> 18:32.004
Oh... I guess I have
one occasion for it.

18:32.029 --> 18:34.277
- What's that?
- My funeral.

18:34.474 --> 18:35.611
Very funny.

18:35.680 --> 18:38.121
No really, these are expensive, Vito.

18:38.146 --> 18:39.778
- Bullshit, will you stop?
- You don't have to do this for me.

18:39.802 --> 18:41.755
- No, really...
- Please, will you stop?

18:42.305 --> 18:44.286
It's my gift to you, all right?

18:45.893 --> 18:47.826
Maybe you got a special occasion.

18:48.382 --> 18:50.364
With your family, or...

18:50.971 --> 18:52.704
You never talk about your family.

18:54.099 --> 18:56.177
Well, my family, I didn't really...

18:57.109 --> 18:58.693
That's a whole other conversation.

19:02.324 --> 19:03.623
That's all right.

19:04.548 --> 19:06.048
You're my family now.

19:10.662 --> 19:12.629
Stand up straight, look at yourself.

19:13.377 --> 19:14.544
Look good.

19:15.493 --> 19:16.755
Yeah!

19:22.461 --> 19:23.627
Stay.

20:16.096 --> 20:18.919
Hank needs to be reminded
who his partners really are.

20:22.746 --> 20:23.849
Do it.

20:40.763 --> 20:43.818
Poor Hank. Didn't know
what he got himself into.

20:44.348 --> 20:47.052
Poor us for having to deal
with the ripple effects.

20:59.646 --> 21:00.779
Where is he?

21:02.654 --> 21:04.817
All right, we all need
to get on the same page

21:04.842 --> 21:06.313
so things don't get outta hand.

21:06.358 --> 21:07.724
What were you thinking?

21:07.983 --> 21:09.435
- I was thinking...
- No, wait!

21:10.034 --> 21:11.950
I'm gonna start
with a different question.

21:12.532 --> 21:19.002
How do you do, what you
did, without consulting anyone?

21:19.027 --> 21:20.714
I didn't think I had
to consult anyone...

21:20.738 --> 21:22.471
Do you know how badly you screwed up?

21:22.496 --> 21:23.489
May I speak?

21:23.514 --> 21:28.568
Hank, the guy whose car you blew
up for no explicable reason,

21:28.943 --> 21:31.179
do you know that he's,
he's dating Papa Lou's sister?

21:31.204 --> 21:32.435
Do you know who Papa Lou is?

21:32.460 --> 21:34.342
- The Haitian gang leader.
- I didn't know the sister thing.

21:34.366 --> 21:35.569
You don't know the sister thing

21:35.593 --> 21:37.225
because getting back
to my first question,

21:37.249 --> 21:39.988
you didn't consult anybody
before blowing up the car,

21:40.013 --> 21:41.560
we would have told you not to do that.

21:41.599 --> 21:44.092
- That was your second question.
- No, it's not my second question,

21:44.116 --> 21:45.701
I've changed my second
question to my first question.

21:45.725 --> 21:47.237
We'll deal with my
second question later.

21:47.261 --> 21:49.128
What the hell is this goddamn dog?

21:49.230 --> 21:51.880
I bought the kids a dog 'cause
they're missing their grandfather.

21:54.130 --> 21:57.505
Your dad goes
to prison and you buy a dog.

21:57.942 --> 22:00.553
You wanna tell me how to be a parent
now? How many kids do you have?

22:00.577 --> 22:02.201
Okay, take it easy.
Take it easy. Take it easy.

22:02.225 --> 22:04.685
Papa Lou, Papa Lou, Papa Lou.

22:05.055 --> 22:06.921
He kills guys for less.

22:07.013 --> 22:08.474
A lot less.

22:08.896 --> 22:12.454
Not to mention that
we've got a lucrative

22:12.522 --> 22:15.123
hashish and prostitution
business going with him.

22:15.192 --> 22:16.391
Kiss that money goodbye.

22:16.460 --> 22:17.636
You telling me to be scared?

22:17.660 --> 22:19.327
- Okay, there...
- Bruno, stay outta this!

22:20.763 --> 22:22.958
His incompetence doesn't stop there.

22:22.983 --> 22:27.943
Just by coincidence, Hank's
girlfriend, Papa Lou's sister,

22:28.154 --> 22:31.005
lives above the building
of O'Leary's Pub,

22:31.074 --> 22:33.458
and that's where the Irish are
running their ecstasy out of.

22:33.544 --> 22:37.744
Well, that explosion caused
so many goddamn cops to come

22:37.813 --> 22:39.724
that the Irish had to put
their operation on hold for,

22:39.748 --> 22:41.259
I don't know, two weeks, maybe a month.

22:41.283 --> 22:42.661
And they want us to cover their losses.

22:42.685 --> 22:44.596
- Too bad for them.
- No, it's not too bad for them.

22:44.620 --> 22:45.919
We're gonna cover their losses.

22:45.988 --> 22:48.254
That's a clear violation on our part.

22:48.323 --> 22:50.156
And they can shove it up their asses.

22:50.225 --> 22:51.810
- We are in charge!
- No!

22:51.841 --> 22:53.982
No! You reneged
on your father's deal.

22:54.007 --> 22:55.428
I made an executive decision.

22:55.498 --> 22:58.466
You're not a goddamn executive of shit!

23:02.071 --> 23:04.272
The problem, as I see it,

23:04.388 --> 23:07.107
is that you want to bend over
for every goddamn thing.

23:07.175 --> 23:09.161
We have to be twice as hard now.

23:09.186 --> 23:10.513
The message has to be clear.

23:10.538 --> 23:14.169
Vito may be gone, but the
Rizzutos still run everything.

23:14.194 --> 23:15.475
Did you hear that last part, Declan?

23:15.499 --> 23:16.763
The Rizzutos.

23:16.788 --> 23:18.288
Remind me again your last name!

23:26.888 --> 23:29.488
Uh... I think the dog just took a piss.

23:31.230 --> 23:32.474
God damn it!

23:34.523 --> 23:35.822
What?

23:36.349 --> 23:38.091
What? Sophie?

23:38.116 --> 23:39.949
- Get him outta here.
- I'll be right there.

23:40.031 --> 23:41.764
Declan...

23:41.989 --> 23:43.255
What's wrong?

23:43.698 --> 23:46.232
Get the hell off of me,
you group of shitheads!

23:46.257 --> 23:47.607
Get off me!

23:47.875 --> 23:49.040
Get off!

23:49.250 --> 23:51.316
Hey, hey, hey! Sophie, whoa, whoa!

23:51.385 --> 23:52.625
Tell these freaks to let me go!

23:52.654 --> 23:54.453
They'll let you go if you calm down.

23:54.522 --> 23:56.188
- Calm down, baby.
- Get 'em off!

23:56.213 --> 23:59.515
Calm down or this is gonna get ugly.

23:59.973 --> 24:01.473
Hey, come on.

24:03.374 --> 24:04.513
Okay?

24:04.978 --> 24:06.745
I got her. Come on.

24:08.411 --> 24:10.013
Come on. Come on.

24:10.427 --> 24:12.572
Come on over here.
Come on.

24:14.613 --> 24:16.919
- Why you so drunk?
- I'm not.

24:16.944 --> 24:18.802
- You're drunk.
- So?

24:18.827 --> 24:21.302
Why would you come here?
His family's inside.

24:21.364 --> 24:22.739
No one's gonna return my calls.

24:22.764 --> 24:24.582
- You know he's not here...
- Vito won't call me.

24:24.606 --> 24:26.407
- No, no, no, no...
- My letters get returned.

24:26.632 --> 24:28.097
Why won't he call me?

24:29.312 --> 24:30.536
Listen.

24:31.745 --> 24:32.997
You hear me?

24:34.600 --> 24:36.904
You gotta get it together right now.

24:37.564 --> 24:39.464
Or you could very well end up dead.

24:43.137 --> 24:44.570
Okay. Okay.

24:45.217 --> 24:46.349
Okay.

24:46.732 --> 24:49.622
Come on... Come on...

24:51.277 --> 24:53.255
Come on... Come on.

24:55.582 --> 24:59.149
Was he... Was he still
talking to that other slut?

24:59.498 --> 25:00.646
The old one?

25:01.740 --> 25:03.505
- Just tell me!
- No.

25:05.954 --> 25:07.687
You want me to tell you something?

25:08.622 --> 25:09.802
This is the truth.

25:10.505 --> 25:12.685
'Cause I see him, I talk to him.

25:13.349 --> 25:14.521
He misses you.

25:14.627 --> 25:15.792
Okay?

25:15.817 --> 25:19.880
But listen, you have
to be 100% invisible.

25:20.443 --> 25:23.544
I mean he's on monitors
all the time, 24/7 okay?

25:23.569 --> 25:25.643
So he can't be in contact with anyone.

25:26.812 --> 25:27.812
Okay.

25:27.880 --> 25:29.458
- Okay...
- Take her home!

25:29.992 --> 25:31.992
We're gonna take you home, okay?
Go home.

25:32.217 --> 25:33.283
I'm sorry.

25:33.352 --> 25:34.784
It's okay. Go home, Sophie.

25:34.853 --> 25:37.349
- I'm sorry.
- Go home. Don't worry about it, baby.

25:37.374 --> 25:39.207
Now go. Come on.

25:45.630 --> 25:47.030
Will this ever end?

25:48.074 --> 25:49.583
Jail, I mean.

25:50.388 --> 25:52.685
- The hell was that?
- Don't worry about it.

25:59.978 --> 26:01.857
- You know what?
- What?

26:02.881 --> 26:04.380
Get the hell outta my house.

26:05.841 --> 26:07.091
That's right, my house.

26:07.351 --> 26:08.568
I grew up in that house.

26:08.593 --> 26:10.216
You're not the head of this family.

26:10.553 --> 26:12.593
How long's it gonna take
for you to understand that?

26:14.566 --> 26:18.302
Your behavior, right now, and upstairs,

26:19.982 --> 26:22.138
you can get
a lot of people killed, Nico.

26:22.655 --> 26:24.755
And maybe even yourself, too.

26:27.474 --> 26:29.669
We pay you to make sure that
that doesn't happen.

26:31.505 --> 26:34.622
If you're not up for the job,
we'll find someone else who is.

26:36.527 --> 26:41.450
Now, if you'll excuse me, the
family is sitting down for dinner.

26:52.709 --> 26:55.318
We're gonna have an
8-foot-long kitchen island.

26:55.466 --> 26:59.449
Gonna have two refrigerators, an
eight burner commercial stove.

26:59.474 --> 27:01.411
It'd be cheaper to buy
an entire restaurant.

27:01.436 --> 27:02.919
Nah, nah, I got a restaurant.

27:03.046 --> 27:05.213
I gotta have seven bedrooms,
and eight bathrooms.

27:05.238 --> 27:06.739
- Eight bathrooms?
- Yeah.

27:06.849 --> 27:08.844
One bathroom for each room, and then

27:08.869 --> 27:10.521
an extra special one just for me.

27:11.036 --> 27:12.997
He's building a hotel, not a house.

27:13.084 --> 27:14.630
What do you need so much for?

27:14.716 --> 27:17.652
Pop, I keep telling you, when I retire,

27:17.677 --> 27:19.009
I want everybody in the family

27:19.078 --> 27:20.690
to come live under
the same roof. All right?

27:20.714 --> 27:21.746
Like in the old days.

27:21.814 --> 27:23.581
Oh, like in the old days.

27:23.650 --> 27:25.629
We left the old country 50 years ago

27:25.654 --> 27:28.411
so we wouldn't have to live
all under the same roof.

27:28.818 --> 27:31.256
Now you give this gift back to us.

27:31.324 --> 27:33.425
Italian prison, thank you very much.

27:33.450 --> 27:36.126
Pop, I'm trying to build a legacy.

27:36.194 --> 27:37.628
This house is fantastic.

27:37.696 --> 27:39.841
It's gonna be so good,
it doesn't need an address.

27:39.950 --> 27:42.527
Everybody's gonna know,
this is the Rizzuto home.

27:42.552 --> 27:45.034
Yeah, build an empire, not a home.

27:45.103 --> 27:46.239
I am, Pop.

27:47.083 --> 27:48.695
Hey, Jerry, I wanna talk to you later

27:48.707 --> 27:50.441
about plans for the green house.

27:50.466 --> 27:51.541
You got it.

27:51.610 --> 27:52.976
- Declan?
- Yeah.

27:53.044 --> 27:55.011
Something's come up
we're gonna need you for.

27:55.080 --> 27:56.122
Anything.

27:56.147 --> 27:58.815
There is a man we have heard
coming from Calabria,

27:58.884 --> 28:01.810
a very dangerous man,
from The 'Ndrangheta.

28:02.621 --> 28:04.160
They call him "The Smile"

28:04.185 --> 28:05.732
because he's got all these scars.

28:05.860 --> 28:07.593
He's all cut up,
but he lived through it.

28:08.660 --> 28:10.093
He was hired by the Devil's Kings.

28:10.204 --> 28:12.122
- To do what?
- To kill Vito.

28:12.200 --> 28:14.008
The bikers want to
take over the heroin trade.

28:14.161 --> 28:16.466
The number one priority
is Vito's safety.

28:16.799 --> 28:18.565
I tried to tell him to
go away for a while,

28:18.603 --> 28:19.702
but he won't listen to me.

28:19.771 --> 28:21.171
Pop! Pop, what did I tell ya?

28:21.239 --> 28:22.802
This is not the time to run.

28:22.989 --> 28:24.771
It's the time
to stand still and be calm.

28:24.796 --> 28:26.529
Pop, I'm in this.

28:26.856 --> 28:29.790
As long as I'm alive,
no one's ever gonna harm Vito.

28:31.716 --> 28:32.786
I appreciate that.

28:32.811 --> 28:34.235
On behalf of the family,

28:34.349 --> 28:36.699
I wanna be the first
to invite you to live in

28:36.724 --> 28:40.190
any of the 85 bedrooms that
this guy is making, okay.

28:40.474 --> 28:41.858
Just don't use my bathroom!

28:43.232 --> 28:44.529
The special one.

29:00.076 --> 29:01.710
- Bonjour!
- Ca Va?

29:02.513 --> 29:04.466
- Yeah? Good, me too.
- Sure.

29:06.347 --> 29:07.813
I'm here to see Jacques.

29:11.294 --> 29:12.471
Where's Vito?

29:12.496 --> 29:13.528
Hey.

29:13.987 --> 29:15.130
Just us.

29:19.027 --> 29:21.428
I don't think you came
up here for a hot dog.

29:21.919 --> 29:23.218
What do you want?

29:23.242 --> 29:24.630
Can we talk in private?

29:24.967 --> 29:26.029
No.

29:26.054 --> 29:28.739
- Skip that bullshit.
- Okay, I'll skip the bullshit.

29:29.263 --> 29:31.232
Um, from now on,

29:33.340 --> 29:38.044
all conversations with
The 'Ndrangheta, they're over.

29:41.118 --> 29:42.435
So you know about that?

29:43.739 --> 29:44.802
It's okay.

29:44.975 --> 29:46.091
We understand.

29:47.543 --> 29:50.091
Sometimes, people, they
start thinking its greener

29:50.353 --> 29:51.974
somewhere else, you know?

29:51.999 --> 29:52.999
It's normal.

29:53.309 --> 29:54.607
It's like that

29:54.761 --> 29:57.558
hot girlfriend that you
just can't stop screwing

29:57.583 --> 30:00.857
until you see another hot girlfriend.

30:01.904 --> 30:04.670
I don't know man,
I screw them all, Declan.

30:07.364 --> 30:09.036
Of course you do, Jacques.

30:09.375 --> 30:11.146
You're a very sexy man.

30:11.989 --> 30:15.325
But the Rizzutos, they like
commitment. They're Italian.

30:15.617 --> 30:18.935
You know church, family, food...

30:19.716 --> 30:23.411
So we're gonna make our current
deal more favorable for you.

30:24.005 --> 30:25.739
You're gonna get 5% more,

30:26.828 --> 30:29.910
the product's gonna be 20% more pure.

30:29.935 --> 30:31.284
Now, you can sell it that way or

30:31.309 --> 30:33.890
you can chop it up into
the shit you normally do.

30:35.419 --> 30:37.425
Why would you come here
offering me more money

30:37.450 --> 30:38.930
if you think I'm trying to screw you?

30:39.025 --> 30:41.333
Vito, he understands people.

30:42.388 --> 30:44.675
People get angry, when they feel

30:44.700 --> 30:46.685
they're not getting
what they deserve, you know?

30:46.881 --> 30:49.214
We should all be happy
with what we're getting.

30:49.596 --> 30:53.065
That way there's no reason
to screw it all up.

30:53.747 --> 30:54.911
He's, uh...

30:55.310 --> 30:57.114
Sigmund Freud, your boss.

31:00.075 --> 31:02.126
Okay, good. Decalisse.

31:02.279 --> 31:04.529
I got one more thing for you.
It's in the car.

31:04.990 --> 31:06.068
Don't shoot.

31:06.815 --> 31:07.919
Gio.

31:12.327 --> 31:14.208
- Brought us a gift?
- Yeah.

31:20.954 --> 31:22.254
Sacrément...

31:22.622 --> 31:24.182
He was a vile bastard, this one.

31:24.474 --> 31:25.919
You should've heard what he was saying

31:25.943 --> 31:28.211
the moment before
I chopped off his head.

31:38.591 --> 31:42.989
If you ever, ever try
to screw us again, ever.

31:44.271 --> 31:46.404
The rest of The Smile's
body parts are gonna be found

31:46.473 --> 31:49.747
in all the exhaust pipes of every
bike that I see around here.

31:49.919 --> 31:51.857
You will all go to prison for the

31:52.279 --> 31:54.068
murder of that little shitty bastard.

31:55.107 --> 31:57.780
Next time you're unhappy, just
come back to the hot girlfriend.

31:57.849 --> 31:59.091
Talk to us.

31:59.670 --> 32:00.969
We're pretty reasonable.

32:32.854 --> 32:33.872
Excuse me.

32:34.542 --> 32:36.309
Where did you get your purse?

32:39.047 --> 32:41.724
It was a gift from my boyfriend.

32:41.944 --> 32:44.078
Aw, well, it's beautiful.

32:44.420 --> 32:46.220
Your boyfriend has very good taste.

32:48.237 --> 32:49.636
Thank you.

32:56.239 --> 32:57.591
You should try that on.

32:57.797 --> 32:59.739
It would look great with your skin tone.

33:00.488 --> 33:02.087
It's not really my style.

33:08.817 --> 33:10.208
What about this?

33:11.318 --> 33:12.521
It's nice.

33:13.237 --> 33:14.763
Well, let me put it this way.

33:14.985 --> 33:17.685
Your boyfriend obviously
has very good taste.

33:17.903 --> 33:19.203
Would he like a dress like this?

33:19.974 --> 33:21.200
On you, I mean.

33:23.146 --> 33:27.130
He prefers things that are
a bit more, um, understated.

33:29.598 --> 33:33.661
See I find that they say that
in public, but, not in private.

33:35.870 --> 33:37.247
But, I mean, what do I know?

33:37.649 --> 33:38.950
I'm still single.

33:41.210 --> 33:43.476
- Excuse me.
- Yeah, of course.

33:55.756 --> 33:58.169
You don't think I know who you are?

33:58.194 --> 33:59.388
Get off of me!

34:00.136 --> 34:01.569
Get off of me!

34:01.594 --> 34:04.255
Stay away from him, you goddamn whore!

34:05.123 --> 34:06.427
Stay out of our life.

34:06.817 --> 34:08.116
I'm gonna kill you!

34:34.791 --> 34:36.107
Good for us.

34:36.695 --> 34:38.349
- Good job.
- All right.

34:39.532 --> 34:41.255
You made a deal with him behind my back?

34:41.574 --> 34:42.875
No, I fixed things.

34:44.324 --> 34:46.067
If my father was here, you
never would have done

34:46.091 --> 34:47.449
something like this
without his consent.

34:47.473 --> 34:48.591
Well, that's right.

34:48.685 --> 34:50.217
But your father would never have created

34:50.242 --> 34:51.683
a mess like this in the first place.

34:51.739 --> 34:52.849
And you're okay with this?

34:53.145 --> 34:54.318
Let him explain.

34:54.896 --> 34:58.755
Your father's explicit long-term vision

34:59.027 --> 35:01.614
is to make all our businesses legit.

35:01.974 --> 35:05.169
So, I've arranged for some
outside financial guys

35:05.194 --> 35:07.302
to come in to finish the project.

35:07.644 --> 35:09.333
We worked with these people before.

35:09.591 --> 35:12.561
Now we're gonna get 1.5% of their cut,

35:12.630 --> 35:14.935
and we'll do all the permits if needed,

35:15.193 --> 35:17.654
and then we get 10% of the sales.

35:17.679 --> 35:18.978
It's already agreed on.

35:19.349 --> 35:21.841
It's all above board.
Are you following me so far?

35:21.940 --> 35:24.073
Then the electrical and water work

35:24.142 --> 35:27.610
are gonna be subcontracted
back to us by the city.

35:27.679 --> 35:28.959
It's already arranged by my guy.

35:29.014 --> 35:30.779
And we're gonna get
more money for that.

35:30.804 --> 35:34.441
And then, to fix the
problem you created

35:34.466 --> 35:36.122
with the Haitians and the Irish,

35:36.147 --> 35:39.215
we're gonna give four
condos for a buck each.

35:39.524 --> 35:41.161
We're gonna give one to the Haitians,

35:41.186 --> 35:44.771
one to the Irish, one to the bikers,
and keep one for ourselves.

35:44.796 --> 35:48.931
So, on the one hand, these gifts
are to help smooth things over.

35:48.999 --> 35:51.934
And on the other hand,
once the complex is finished,

35:52.002 --> 35:53.936
we're gonna have a secure meeting place

35:54.004 --> 35:56.247
where the cops
can't follow us in or out.

35:57.693 --> 35:59.975
- It's good work, Declan.
- Declan, it's very good.

36:00.044 --> 36:02.077
Nonno, how can you say very good?

36:02.146 --> 36:05.302
So we make a few dollars, he
gives condos to these animals!

36:06.416 --> 36:09.818
All we have is our name and
he is using it for himself.

36:09.843 --> 36:12.044
I respect that name more than my own.

36:13.763 --> 36:16.974
Everybody knows Papa wasn't
behind this, it was Declan!

36:17.591 --> 36:18.700
On his own.

36:19.616 --> 36:22.184
Now, I wasn't there, you weren't there.

36:22.209 --> 36:23.849
How do we know what else he gave them?

36:23.874 --> 36:25.747
For the past year, he's the only one

36:25.772 --> 36:27.750
going to Colorado to see my father.

36:28.169 --> 36:30.841
Why have we given him all the keys?

36:30.866 --> 36:33.207
Nico, your father explicitly
wanted Declan

36:33.276 --> 36:37.340
to be the liaison so all the heat
is always on him and only him.

36:37.365 --> 36:38.694
If you wouldn't have gotten busted

36:38.718 --> 36:40.647
with an eight ball in your
pocket in Atlantic City

36:40.671 --> 36:42.615
at your bachelor party, you'd
be racking up the air miles.

36:42.639 --> 36:45.161
- You son of a bitch!
- I'm done. I got work.

36:45.490 --> 36:46.490
Where are you going?

36:46.515 --> 36:47.781
I think I'll go see Hank first.

36:47.806 --> 36:49.686
You do not walk away
from the head of this family

36:49.710 --> 36:50.966
until I say you can!

36:50.991 --> 36:51.991
Declan.

36:53.694 --> 36:54.786
Nico.

36:55.551 --> 36:57.351
You gotta stop this, you understand me?

36:57.529 --> 36:59.318
Your father would
never have permitted this.

36:59.343 --> 37:01.201
Pop's not here right now, though.
That's the whole point.

37:01.225 --> 37:03.302
No, I'll tell you what the point is.

37:03.497 --> 37:05.599
The point is that Declan, has been

37:05.624 --> 37:08.755
at your father's right
hand, for many years.

37:09.351 --> 37:13.318
Declan went to prison for this family.
He stood up.

37:13.787 --> 37:16.599
He knows everything your
father knows and you don't.

37:17.022 --> 37:18.921
Here's what you don't
really understand.

37:18.946 --> 37:22.169
Your father never had this
kind of life in mind for you.

37:22.809 --> 37:24.541
He sent you to private school,

37:24.566 --> 37:26.320
he wanted you to be something else.

37:26.345 --> 37:28.078
He wanted you to have a different life.

37:28.103 --> 37:30.591
And you're gonna listen to him
because I want that too

37:30.616 --> 37:32.256
and you're gonna listen
to the both of us.

37:33.577 --> 37:35.420
I understand that,
but things are different now.

37:35.444 --> 37:37.611
Nonno, family should be
making these decisions.

37:37.636 --> 37:39.560
This is a very dangerous time for us.

37:39.585 --> 37:43.091
And the only person you can
ever really trust is family.

37:43.116 --> 37:44.381
Declan is family.

37:44.406 --> 37:45.959
The only way that people will be certain

37:45.983 --> 37:48.517
that Vito Rizzuto is still
on top of everything

37:48.542 --> 37:52.068
is that if a Rizzuto is there
to say it for him!

37:53.749 --> 37:56.982
Listen, what you really
don't understand,

37:57.441 --> 37:59.919
all we want to do is keep you safe.

38:06.726 --> 38:08.326
- He just walked out.
- Who?

38:08.432 --> 38:09.450
Nico!

38:09.475 --> 38:11.311
He can't be without his protection.
Now get going!

38:11.335 --> 38:13.201
- Nico has the keys.
- Goddamn it!

38:13.226 --> 38:15.734
How many times I gotta tell you
guys you need to protect? Now move!

38:15.758 --> 38:16.758
Move!

38:49.916 --> 38:51.115
Shit! Shit!

38:56.585 --> 38:57.585
Fuck!

39:04.321 --> 39:06.721
Nico! Hey, hey, Nico!

39:06.746 --> 39:08.279
Hey. Oh, shit!

39:09.547 --> 39:11.479
Shit. Nico!

39:11.697 --> 39:13.530
No. No. Argh!

39:13.692 --> 39:15.459
Nico. Nico!

39:16.800 --> 39:18.659
Nico, God. Nico!

39:18.932 --> 39:21.736
There was a drive-by
shooting late last night in Montreal.

39:21.761 --> 39:24.219
The intended victim,
Nicolo Rizzuto Junior,

39:24.244 --> 39:26.511
is the son of mob boss Vito Rizzuto

39:26.579 --> 39:30.034
who is currently serving a 10-year
prison sentence in Colorado.

39:30.058 --> 39:32.166
And so far, no witnesses
have come forward.

39:32.191 --> 39:35.096
We're gonna have to keep you under
observation for a few more days.

39:35.121 --> 39:36.229
Okay?

39:37.581 --> 39:39.247
Just think of this as a miracle.

39:40.319 --> 39:41.534
Thank you, Doctor.

39:44.266 --> 39:45.511
Thank you.

39:51.810 --> 39:53.573
Does this finally settle it for you?

39:55.890 --> 39:57.222
What do you mean?

39:57.999 --> 39:59.398
This proves my point.

40:00.544 --> 40:02.143
Someone tried to kill you!

40:02.168 --> 40:05.167
This proves that people think of
me as the head of this family.

40:05.853 --> 40:07.495
So that's what you take outta this?

40:07.520 --> 40:09.604
Nonno, I don't have a choice anymore.

40:10.051 --> 40:11.229
This is a test.

40:11.544 --> 40:13.221
They wanna see how we handle this.

40:14.437 --> 40:16.862
If I run away and hide, they're
gonna think we're scared.

40:17.294 --> 40:19.182
They're gonna come
for everything that we have.

40:19.207 --> 40:21.127
This is not your father's plan for you.

40:22.498 --> 40:24.432
It's not just about me anymore.

40:26.474 --> 40:27.589
Nonno...

40:29.044 --> 40:30.596
I don't have a death wish.

40:32.865 --> 40:34.784
I'm just trying to protect what's ours.

40:37.473 --> 40:39.409
Bruno, do we have
any idea who did this?

40:39.434 --> 40:40.967
Could've been anyone.

40:40.992 --> 40:43.964
Irish, bikers, Haitians,
another crew from New York...

40:44.150 --> 40:45.983
Our guys are trying to find out.

40:46.091 --> 40:49.224
It could have been anyone, Nico.
You've pissed off a lot of people.

40:49.652 --> 40:53.154
But you're still alive, it's
not too late to step back.

40:54.416 --> 40:55.550
Where's Declan?

40:55.766 --> 40:57.284
Declan saved your life.

41:22.789 --> 41:24.022
Why was he alone?

41:24.047 --> 41:25.784
Like I said, he just ran off.

41:25.809 --> 41:27.550
I leave you in control of my business

41:27.575 --> 41:30.511
and you can't control a kid
who's having a tantrum?

41:30.536 --> 41:32.068
What did I tell you about Nico?

41:32.353 --> 41:33.331
Keep him safe.

41:33.356 --> 41:36.151
I don't give a shit about
anything else, you understand?

41:36.482 --> 41:39.800
Don't you dare try to blame my son.

41:40.671 --> 41:42.170
He's my son.

41:42.372 --> 41:43.771
He's allowed to screw up.

41:45.479 --> 41:48.753
I don't know, maybe putting
you in charge of my business

41:48.778 --> 41:50.214
is like messing with your head.

41:50.239 --> 41:52.706
Or inviting you to my dinner table,

41:52.961 --> 41:54.792
or buying you birthday presents...

41:55.981 --> 41:58.136
Let me make something very clear to you.

41:59.300 --> 42:01.323
You are my employee.

42:03.795 --> 42:05.557
You work for me.

42:06.454 --> 42:10.456
I pay you to take care of my business,

42:10.771 --> 42:15.307
I pay you to take care of my home.

42:15.631 --> 42:20.362
And most importantly, I pay
you to take care of my family.

42:22.605 --> 42:24.581
You work for me.

42:27.301 --> 42:28.503
You understand?

42:29.174 --> 42:30.174
Yes.

42:31.874 --> 42:34.231
Yes, boss! Yes, sir!

42:34.626 --> 42:37.784
Whatever it takes
to remind you of your place.

42:40.998 --> 42:42.130
Yes, boss.

43:16.435 --> 43:17.801
Next time on Bad Blood...

43:17.870 --> 43:19.800
It's not safe in here
for a man like you.

43:19.825 --> 43:21.886
I feel pretty safe about you.

43:22.186 --> 43:23.604
Thanks for your concern.

43:23.629 --> 43:25.378
We have two priorities.

43:25.715 --> 43:28.882
Protect the boss and keep Nico safe.

43:28.907 --> 43:32.034
I, like everyone in this city have read

43:32.059 --> 43:35.901
the brave, shocking reporting
about the corruption

43:35.926 --> 43:38.409
that exists on all levels
of our public works.

43:38.534 --> 43:42.151
And that organized crime
has its hand in all of it.

43:42.176 --> 43:43.642
Shit.

43:44.177 --> 43:47.145
I am Vito, right now!
