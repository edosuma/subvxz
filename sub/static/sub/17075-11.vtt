WEBVTT

00:00.793 --> 00:03.090
It still feels weird
that we're doing this.

00:03.092 --> 00:04.591
Why? We've always made Mom and Dad

00:04.593 --> 00:06.258
breakfast in bed on their anniversary.

00:06.261 --> 00:08.228
It's just, this year, Mom's alone in bed

00:08.230 --> 00:10.397
and Dad lives in the garage.

00:10.399 --> 00:12.733
Okay, but celebrating the
anniversary of a marriage

00:12.735 --> 00:14.000
that ended in divorce

00:14.002 --> 00:16.803
feels like having a birthday
party for a dead person.

00:16.805 --> 00:19.005
That's like Christmas.

00:19.007 --> 00:21.441
Hmm, good point. Let's plate those eggs.

00:21.443 --> 00:23.922
Mnh-mnh. None for me, thank you.

00:25.914 --> 00:27.791
Don't want to fill up.

00:29.072 --> 00:32.119
'Cause I'm having brunch with
my honey, my boo, my boyfriend!

00:32.121 --> 00:34.020
Oh, my God, we had no
idea you were dating

00:34.022 --> 00:35.555
the most wonderful guy in the world.

00:35.557 --> 00:37.224
Yeah. Why don't you ever talk about him

00:37.226 --> 00:39.593
all the time and never shut up about it?

00:39.595 --> 00:41.528
Okay, I know you're being
sarcastic, but, you guys,

00:41.530 --> 00:42.829
look how cute we are.

00:43.799 --> 00:45.232
Allison says, "Where are you?

00:45.234 --> 00:46.867
Crab, umbrella, French-fry emoji."

00:46.869 --> 00:48.435
God, she's weird even in text.

00:48.437 --> 00:50.637
She wants me to come to this
lesbian slam-poetry thing

00:50.639 --> 00:53.907
she's doing, but today is a very
important day for me and Brett.

00:53.909 --> 00:55.342
What's so important about today?

00:55.344 --> 00:57.844
Well, not only is today
my first gay brunch,

00:57.846 --> 01:00.547
but I'm also meeting
Brett's BFF, Christie.

01:00.549 --> 01:04.284
She's visiting him from
New Jersey and, no big deal,

01:04.286 --> 01:09.156
but she was Miss Teen
Turnpike three years running.

01:09.158 --> 01:11.625
Did you kids make breakfast?

01:11.627 --> 01:13.860
Yep. For your anniversary.

01:13.862 --> 01:15.595
- Pat.
- Hmm?

01:15.597 --> 01:16.797
The kids made breakfast

01:16.799 --> 01:18.632
for what would've been our anniversary.

01:18.634 --> 01:21.568
Guys, that is so weird.

01:21.570 --> 01:23.603
Well, happy 19th anniversary.

01:23.605 --> 01:26.406
Yeah, or happy first non-iversary.

01:26.408 --> 01:28.275
Yeah, sure, that sounds like a thing.

01:28.277 --> 01:30.210
You know what's not a thing...

01:30.212 --> 01:32.546
Um, breakfast sausages
dipped in coleslaw.

01:32.548 --> 01:33.513
Excuse me.

01:33.515 --> 01:35.348
When slawsages sweep the nation,

01:35.350 --> 01:37.150
don't ask me to buy you a house.

01:37.152 --> 01:40.513

01:47.830 --> 01:50.397
What was that God-awful sound?

01:50.399 --> 01:52.432
It's my new margarita machine.

01:52.434 --> 01:54.534
I was feeling a little
down after Gloria.

01:54.536 --> 01:57.737
Thought I deserved a
pick-me-up, so... it's a little

01:57.739 --> 01:59.406
"to Pat, from Pat" kind of thing.

01:59.408 --> 02:01.842
- Oh, yeah. You even gav
 yourself a card. - Yeah.

02:01.844 --> 02:03.176
I was hoping Clive
would come over tonight,

02:03.178 --> 02:05.645
but I guess he's stuck at
school working out the budget.

02:05.647 --> 02:07.180
That's odd.

02:07.182 --> 02:08.582
He told me he can't go out tonight

02:08.584 --> 02:10.083
'cause he's taking care of his mother.

02:10.085 --> 02:12.586
She hyperextended her
leg kicking the gardener.

02:12.588 --> 02:16.223
Why won't he introduce me
to that fascinating woman?

02:16.225 --> 02:18.358
Well, either way, I'm sure
it's just a misunderstanding.

02:18.360 --> 02:19.459
Right?

02:19.461 --> 02:21.077
Yeah. Right.

02:23.465 --> 02:26.032
You know what... It
actually doesn't matter.

02:26.034 --> 02:27.634
We're adults, you know?

02:27.636 --> 02:29.102
Yeah.

02:29.104 --> 02:30.270
I mean, it's none of my business

02:30.272 --> 02:31.404
what he does with his own time.

02:31.406 --> 02:32.973
Yeah.

02:32.975 --> 02:35.775
You know, if I see him,
I'll ask him about it.

02:35.777 --> 02:37.914
Or not. You know?

02:37.917 --> 02:39.747
Maybe I'll forget.

02:39.748 --> 02:41.081
Mm.

02:41.083 --> 02:42.682
Maybe I've already forgotten.

02:42.684 --> 02:44.094
There you go.

02:44.097 --> 02:45.752
Unrelated to that,

02:45.754 --> 02:47.821
how about we fire up
that margarita machine?

02:47.823 --> 02:50.290
There you go. It's
Mexico somewhere, right?

02:50.292 --> 02:51.291
Yeah.

02:54.162 --> 02:56.897
Man. I thought having this
car would help me get girls.

02:56.899 --> 02:58.331
I mean, I named her "The Love Car."

02:58.333 --> 02:59.833
but the only girls who've been in here

02:59.835 --> 03:02.269
are Shannon and her stupid friends.

03:02.271 --> 03:05.138
Well, thanks for driving
me to the airport.

03:05.140 --> 03:07.407
I'm second-guessing my brunch outfit.

03:07.409 --> 03:09.743
Should I have worn a bow
tie? Am I that kind of guy?

03:09.745 --> 03:12.012
Do I want to be that kind of guy?

03:12.014 --> 03:14.648
Why is your brother so
excited about breakfast?

03:14.650 --> 03:18.184
It is not just breakfast,
Claire. It is brunch.

03:18.186 --> 03:19.853
And it's like gay church.

03:19.855 --> 03:21.154
- Can I go to brunch?
- No.

03:21.156 --> 03:23.990
Meeting your boyfriend's best
girlfriend is a huge deal.

03:23.992 --> 03:25.625
They used to be called "fag hags,"

03:25.627 --> 03:27.127
but that's super offensive.

03:27.129 --> 03:27.961
What do you call them now?

03:27.963 --> 03:29.162
"Fruit flies."

03:29.164 --> 03:30.430
And how is that better?

03:30.432 --> 03:32.165
I wish I could be someone's fruit fly.

03:32.167 --> 03:34.301
Of course you do, Claire,

03:34.303 --> 03:36.036
because straight women can't help

03:36.038 --> 03:38.872
but be drawn to gay men.

03:38.874 --> 03:42.275
And we celebrate that
love through brunch,

03:42.277 --> 03:45.445
with equal parts
champagne, orange juice,

03:45.447 --> 03:47.614
and fruit-fly adoration.

03:47.616 --> 03:51.084
Ugh. I'm so happy to
finally meet you, Christie.

03:51.086 --> 03:52.185
You're perfect.

03:52.187 --> 03:53.687
Aww, you're sweet.

03:53.689 --> 03:56.156
From now on, I will
pick out all your outfits

03:56.158 --> 03:58.325
and help you choose what
guys to date until the day

03:58.327 --> 04:00.927
that I officiate your wedding
in a Hugo Boss pastel tux

04:00.929 --> 04:03.530
that manages to be both
flattering and masculine.

04:03.532 --> 04:04.698
Thank you.

04:04.700 --> 04:06.566
- Anything else?
- Actually, yes.

04:06.568 --> 04:08.668
I'd love to take a
ride on a baby unicorn.

04:08.670 --> 04:10.971
Certainly. Princess
Glitter's right this way.

04:16.577 --> 04:18.310
- She did?
- Um, you know she did.

04:18.313 --> 04:19.245
And I was like...

04:19.247 --> 04:20.846
"Nuh-uh, nurse."

04:22.551 --> 04:23.717
Here's your virgin mimosa.

04:23.719 --> 04:25.118
Do you think you could put it

04:25.120 --> 04:26.686
in a champagne flute?

04:26.688 --> 04:27.639
I could.

04:29.144 --> 04:31.224
- I'm sorry, Kenny.
- We were up all night talking,

04:31.226 --> 04:32.525
but it's like we can never stop.

04:32.527 --> 04:34.527
Oh, it's like that time
when we were in Trig II,

04:34.529 --> 04:35.829
and Mrs. Campos was like...

04:35.831 --> 04:37.597
"Zip it, Brettstie."

04:37.599 --> 04:39.566
Nuh-uh, nurse.

04:39.568 --> 04:40.400
Sorry, what?

04:40.402 --> 04:41.668
Nothing.

04:41.670 --> 04:43.546
So, "Real Housewives" marathon tonight.

04:43.549 --> 04:44.838
- Yes.
- How excited are we?

04:44.840 --> 04:46.606
Yes.

04:46.608 --> 04:48.742
Yes, so excited.

04:48.744 --> 04:51.011
I love "Real Housewives."

04:51.013 --> 04:54.724
I... I just love watching
those housewives being all real.

04:54.727 --> 04:56.983
Awesome. Can we watch at your place?

04:56.985 --> 04:58.985
My mom has bridge club
tonight and, you know,

04:58.987 --> 05:01.154
after a few rosÃ©s, Mrs.
King gets a little handsy.

05:01.156 --> 05:02.555
She does.

05:02.557 --> 05:04.190
Wow.

05:04.192 --> 05:06.092
An entire night of the
three of us hanging out

05:06.094 --> 05:07.627
and you two speaking in unison.

05:07.629 --> 05:10.597
Yay.

05:10.599 --> 05:13.900
In fact, I will invite my BFF,

05:13.902 --> 05:15.602
Allison, to join us.

05:15.604 --> 05:16.870
The girl who doesn't wash her hair?

05:16.872 --> 05:18.672
Uh, no, she actually does wash her hair.

05:18.674 --> 05:21.274
She was just born with extra oil glands.

05:24.312 --> 05:26.112
Thanks so much, Jimmy.

05:26.114 --> 05:27.580
- Whatever.
- Bye, Shannon.

05:27.582 --> 05:29.983
All right, let's go home.

05:29.985 --> 05:31.084
Mm, wait.

05:31.086 --> 05:32.886
I forgot, I promised a couple of friends

05:32.888 --> 05:34.888
we'd drop them off at the Radisson.

05:34.890 --> 05:37.190
Oh. Hey, friends, hop in.

05:37.192 --> 05:39.426
Thirsty?

05:39.428 --> 05:40.960
So, how do you guys know each other?

05:40.962 --> 05:43.229
Don't look at me, driver.

05:43.231 --> 05:45.830
Geez. Nice friends, Shannon.

05:45.833 --> 05:47.434
Okay, this was fun for a minute,

05:47.436 --> 05:49.869
but I really thought
you'd figure it out by now.

05:49.871 --> 05:51.004
You're an Uber driver.

05:51.006 --> 05:53.173
What? No, I'm not.

05:53.175 --> 05:55.575
Then why does your car
smell like cheap cologne?

05:55.577 --> 05:57.410
I'm trying something new.

05:57.412 --> 05:59.045
I saw you driving around for free

05:59.047 --> 06:00.447
and saw a business opportunity.

06:00.449 --> 06:02.582
How did you make me an Uber
driver without me knowing it?

06:02.584 --> 06:04.951
There are many things I have you
doing that you're not aware of.

06:04.953 --> 06:07.187
Right now, you're in a
clinical trial for LIPITOR.

06:07.189 --> 06:08.555
F-Fine.

06:08.557 --> 06:11.257
But if The Love Car is
going to become The Love Cab,

06:11.259 --> 06:13.693
then I want half the profits.

06:13.695 --> 06:15.195
Deal.

06:15.197 --> 06:17.197
- Charge your phones?
- Mm-hmm.

06:17.199 --> 06:19.065
These are good.

06:19.067 --> 06:20.533
They're like an adult snow cone.

06:20.535 --> 06:22.368
Mmm-hmm. Yes.

06:22.370 --> 06:24.437
- Mmm.
- See, this was fun, right?

06:24.439 --> 06:26.573
- So fun.
- Yeah.

06:28.510 --> 06:30.610
I can't stop thinking about Clive.

06:30.612 --> 06:32.712
Why would he give us
two different excuses

06:32.714 --> 06:33.980
for where he is tonight?

06:33.982 --> 06:36.249
- Why don't you call him?
- All right.

06:36.251 --> 06:38.251
Yeah, I'm sure it's
just a misunderstanding.

06:42.357 --> 06:43.389
Hey, Snuggles.

06:43.391 --> 06:45.225
Hi, Vice Principal Sexy...

06:45.227 --> 06:46.960
Mm, Clive.

06:46.962 --> 06:48.628
Um, I was just wondering...

06:48.630 --> 06:50.997
Hey, I'm so sorry, again, about tonight.

06:50.999 --> 06:53.266
It looks like Mother's
gonna need me all evening.

06:53.268 --> 06:56.970
- Oh, so you're still at your mom's?
- Yeah, just pulled up.

06:56.972 --> 06:59.239
Her leg's even more
hyperextended than we thought.

06:59.241 --> 07:01.374
The doc likened it to an old accordion.

07:01.376 --> 07:03.910
She's actually two inches
taller, but just on one side.

07:03.912 --> 07:06.479
Hey, um, I'm just getting another call.

07:06.481 --> 07:08.314
- Could you please hold?
- Okay.

07:08.316 --> 07:11.551
- Yello?
- Hey, brother.

07:11.553 --> 07:12.719
Just wanted to call and make sure

07:12.721 --> 07:14.053
you can't come over and
watch the game tonight.

07:14.055 --> 07:16.156
Aw, no. So sorry.

07:16.158 --> 07:17.357
I just got to the school.

07:17.359 --> 07:18.525
I'm gonna be working here all night

07:18.527 --> 07:20.260
on the budget, like I thought.

07:20.262 --> 07:22.328
I see. So you're still
at the school right now?

07:22.330 --> 07:24.030
Yeah. Yeah. It's a real pickle.

07:24.032 --> 07:25.386
Every time I crunch the numbers,

07:25.389 --> 07:27.867
the budget's over by my exact salary.

07:27.869 --> 07:29.502
Oh, well, that's a bummer.

07:29.504 --> 07:31.437
Uh, good luck.

07:31.439 --> 07:32.672
What the hell is going on?

07:32.674 --> 07:35.186
I don't know.

07:35.189 --> 07:37.690
Why do I suddenly feel like doing this?

07:41.249 --> 07:44.216
Damn. I only had two glasses.

07:45.163 --> 07:47.312
Hey, hurry up.

07:47.315 --> 07:48.381
Hey.

07:48.383 --> 07:49.382
Listen, I know you're mad

07:49.384 --> 07:50.817
that Clive wasn't at
his mother's house...

07:50.819 --> 07:52.886
And that she didn't bother
answering the door when I rang.

07:52.888 --> 07:55.855
And when I peeked in the window,
she was in there jumping rope.

07:55.857 --> 07:56.956
What?

07:56.958 --> 07:58.792
Accordion leg, my ass.

08:00.996 --> 08:04.330
I can faintly smell his
cologne, but he's not here.

08:04.332 --> 08:06.266
He lied to me, too?
Why would he do that?

08:06.268 --> 08:08.101
I don't know.

08:08.103 --> 08:10.136
All right, come on. We should go.

08:10.138 --> 08:11.638
Probably.

08:11.640 --> 08:14.641
Although...

08:14.643 --> 08:17.343
If we looked on his computer,
that might tell us something.

08:17.345 --> 08:18.845
- He might have been abducted.
- Yeah.

08:18.847 --> 08:21.047
And he's trying to signal us
without alerting his captors.

08:21.049 --> 08:23.516
Sure. It would be irresponsible
for us not to investigate.

08:23.518 --> 08:26.853
And if we just happen to accidentally

08:26.855 --> 08:29.722
tap his mouse and his
computer woke up...

08:35.730 --> 08:38.664
All right, enough. Try the space bar.

08:38.667 --> 08:42.202
What? He has a reservation
for two for Bianco e Rosso?

08:42.203 --> 08:44.102
He and I have eaten there.
The bruschetta's amazing.

08:44.105 --> 08:46.806
Yeah, I know. We had our first date...

08:46.808 --> 08:49.409
Oh, my God.

08:49.411 --> 08:51.344
Could he be on a date?

08:51.346 --> 08:53.046
There's that feeling again.

08:55.000 --> 09:01.074

09:05.930 --> 09:07.293
Sorry you had to miss your turn

09:07.295 --> 09:09.028
in the poetry slam to come over.

09:09.030 --> 09:10.930
Well, you said it was an emergency.

09:10.932 --> 09:14.000
I am disappointed no
one got to hear my piece.

09:14.002 --> 09:17.303
It's called "I'm Trapped
in a Rapidly Filling Box."

09:17.305 --> 09:18.171
Would you like to hear?

09:18.173 --> 09:19.105
Okay, Brett and Christie

09:19.107 --> 09:20.473
will be here in a couple of hours.

09:20.475 --> 09:22.475
We have to learn enough
about "The Real Housewives"

09:22.477 --> 09:23.510
that I don't look like a big liar.

09:23.512 --> 09:25.111
I've never seen "Housewives,"

09:25.113 --> 09:27.080
but I've seen every single
episode of "Hoarders."

09:27.082 --> 09:28.414
Oh, no.

09:28.416 --> 09:31.117
There are "Real Housewives"
in nine different cities,

09:31.119 --> 09:32.585
eight seasons of each.

09:32.587 --> 09:34.153
How are we going to learn all of this?

09:34.155 --> 09:35.822
Hush! Hush!

09:35.824 --> 09:39.826
The journey of a million
miles can't begin, won't begin.

09:39.828 --> 09:42.795
I'm trapped in a rapidly filling box.

09:42.797 --> 09:44.564
That's good. Get this out now.

09:44.567 --> 09:46.300
Okay, you know what...

09:46.303 --> 09:48.501
There's no way we're gonna
be able to learn all of this.

09:48.503 --> 09:51.371
We have to work on our
best-friend rapport. Right?

09:51.373 --> 09:54.507
Brett and Christie know
everything about each other.

09:54.509 --> 09:59.045
So, I know that you are Allison.

09:59.047 --> 10:01.180
- Correct.
- You are a lesbian

10:01.182 --> 10:03.149
and...

10:06.254 --> 10:07.320
Now you go.

10:07.322 --> 10:08.655
Your dream is to be the first

10:08.657 --> 10:10.523
openly gay Supreme Court Justice.

10:10.525 --> 10:12.792
You want to travel the world,
but you're afraid of planes

10:12.794 --> 10:15.295
because, like your mother,
Eileen Mary Bridget O'Neal,

10:15.297 --> 10:17.730
you have control issues
rooted in insecurity.

10:17.732 --> 10:19.399
Also, you wear a size-eight shoe

10:19.401 --> 10:22.302
and secretly want to wear bow ties.

10:22.304 --> 10:23.336
Mm-kay, how 'bout this?

10:23.338 --> 10:24.804
I'm gonna call the
potato chips "skibbles,"

10:24.806 --> 10:27.073
and you're gonna pretend like
you know what I'm talking about.

10:27.075 --> 10:28.474
Deal.

10:28.476 --> 10:30.310
Thank you so much for rescuing me

10:30.312 --> 10:31.978
from that disaster of a date.

10:31.980 --> 10:32.979
You're so welcome.

10:32.981 --> 10:35.415
But now we need a carpool fare.

10:35.417 --> 10:36.683
So what exactly happened?

10:36.685 --> 10:38.585
Kevin and I were ice skating,

10:38.587 --> 10:40.453
and he got all Tonya
Harding on the rink manager

10:40.455 --> 10:42.221
when he told him he couldn't
have snacks on the ice.

10:42.223 --> 10:43.056
There he is.

10:43.058 --> 10:44.591
Then he threw his nachos

10:44.593 --> 10:46.392
at the Zamboni driver.

10:47.862 --> 10:49.596
Thanks.

10:49.598 --> 10:51.598
Welcome... Richard.

10:51.600 --> 10:54.067
Hello.

10:54.069 --> 10:55.168
Hi.

10:55.170 --> 10:56.269
Hi.

10:56.271 --> 10:59.272
You've got a nacho in your...

10:59.274 --> 11:01.474
There, now you're perfect.

11:01.476 --> 11:03.610
Well, thank you.

11:03.612 --> 11:05.578
Don't you dare drop me off. I need this.

11:05.580 --> 11:06.646
Yes, ma'am.

11:06.648 --> 11:08.881
Jimmy, she's taking up
valuable real estate.

11:08.883 --> 11:10.416
I don't care.

11:10.418 --> 11:13.086
If I can't find romance in
this car, at least someone can.

11:13.088 --> 11:15.388
And then when "Love
Cab" becomes a movie,

11:15.390 --> 11:17.290
I will be played by Chris Pratt.

11:17.292 --> 11:19.125
Oh, you wish.

11:19.828 --> 11:22.161
- Yes! Yes. Oh, my God.
- Okay, let's play.

11:22.163 --> 11:23.329
Okay. Let's play.

11:23.331 --> 11:26.499
Oh, "Real Housewives"
bingo is so much fun.

11:26.501 --> 11:28.067
I'm glad I'm such a fan of the show

11:28.069 --> 11:30.136
or I'd find this really
challenging and stressful.

11:30.138 --> 11:33.406
Well, Jules just screamed
"pre-nup," so that's a point.

11:33.408 --> 11:35.775
Okay, well, the countess had
on a chunky statement necklace,

11:35.777 --> 11:37.076
so take that, bitch.

11:37.078 --> 11:38.911
Oh, boo.

11:38.913 --> 11:40.079
Oh, Kenny, you forgot one.

11:40.081 --> 11:41.748
Ramona threw her drink
in someone's face.

11:41.750 --> 11:45.451
Oh, of course. Good ol' Ramona.

11:45.453 --> 11:48.221
She definitely doesn't look
like all those other ladies.

11:48.223 --> 11:49.188
Right, bitch?

11:49.190 --> 11:51.624
Why are you being mean to me?

11:51.626 --> 11:54.360
Okay, just, uh, pass
me the skibbles, please.

11:54.362 --> 11:57.096
- The what?
- Okay, never mind.

11:57.098 --> 11:59.999
I cannot believe that Sonja
slept with the countess's fiancÃ©.

12:00.001 --> 12:01.934
Like, how are they all still friends?

12:01.936 --> 12:04.270
Well, we had sex, and
we're still friends.

12:04.272 --> 12:06.773
Huh, wait, what?

12:08.543 --> 12:10.877
Oh, my God. I'm so
sorry. I thought you knew.

12:10.879 --> 12:12.378
Kenny, it was not a big deal.

12:12.380 --> 12:14.914
Yeah, totally, it
happened once forever ago,

12:14.916 --> 12:16.649
back when we were a couple.

12:16.651 --> 12:18.418
You were a couple?

12:21.322 --> 12:23.389
Bitches!

12:23.391 --> 12:25.958
That's a real housewife would do it.

12:27.829 --> 12:30.396
Oh, my God.

12:30.398 --> 12:31.998
He is on a date.

12:33.771 --> 12:35.501
- Hello, Clive.
- Eileen.

12:35.503 --> 12:36.703
What... What are you... what?

12:36.705 --> 12:38.037
I'm not going to make a scene.

12:38.039 --> 12:39.672
I just wanted to say that I've enjoyed

12:39.674 --> 12:42.175
our time together and
I'm sorry that you felt

12:42.177 --> 12:43.943
the need to go behind my back

12:43.945 --> 12:45.611
and cheat on me with this whore.

12:45.613 --> 12:48.181
This is the hostess, Melissa.

12:48.183 --> 12:50.950
I was trying to get gum out of her hair.

12:50.952 --> 12:52.385
Oh.

12:52.387 --> 12:54.721
I was wondering why
there was no one up front.

12:54.723 --> 12:57.023
And here I thought the
kids throwing gum at my head

12:57.025 --> 12:58.491
was going to be the
worst part of my shift.

12:58.493 --> 13:00.526
So sorry I called you a whore, Melissa.

13:00.528 --> 13:02.495
Try peanut butter.

13:02.497 --> 13:06.332
Eileen, how could you ever
think I would cheat on you?

13:06.334 --> 13:08.167
- I would never.
- I don't know.

13:08.169 --> 13:09.402
I wish I could say I was drunk,

13:09.404 --> 13:11.504
but Pat makes really weak margaritas.

13:11.506 --> 13:13.005
Great bathroom soap.

13:13.007 --> 13:14.841
A whisper of geranium.

13:15.944 --> 13:17.410
Oh, hey.

13:17.412 --> 13:18.778
Eileen, this is the friend

13:18.780 --> 13:21.047
I am having dinner with... Marco.

13:21.049 --> 13:22.849
Of course, you're just
here with a friend.

13:22.851 --> 13:24.817
Just?

13:24.819 --> 13:27.357
You dirty, filthy cheater.

13:31.493 --> 13:33.192
- Right?
- Mm-hmm.

13:35.140 --> 13:37.794
Ugh, I can't believe
Brett and Christie had sex.

13:37.796 --> 13:40.096
Would it make you feel
better if we had sex?

13:40.098 --> 13:41.631
- No.
- Thank God.

13:41.633 --> 13:43.533
You don't look anything
like Jennifer Lawrence.

13:43.535 --> 13:45.235
God, I can't believe
they slept together.

13:45.237 --> 13:46.336
Now that I know they slept together,

13:46.338 --> 13:47.537
I feel even more left out.

13:47.539 --> 13:48.905
You feel left out?

13:48.907 --> 13:50.507
- What about me?
- I know.

13:50.509 --> 13:52.008
I mean, they barely
talked to you either.

13:52.010 --> 13:56.179
I have never met
anyone so inconsiderate.

13:56.181 --> 13:59.382
Once I thought our
friendship was indivisible,

13:59.384 --> 14:01.751
then I realized I was just invisible.

14:01.753 --> 14:03.086
Are we doing this again?

14:03.088 --> 14:04.754
It's called free-styling, bitch.

14:04.756 --> 14:06.055
Since you started dating Brett,

14:06.057 --> 14:08.258
you ignore me unless you need something.

14:08.260 --> 14:10.727
I gave up my slot in
the third-most-popular

14:10.729 --> 14:12.996
18-and-under lesbian poetry slam

14:12.998 --> 14:15.498
in the Edison Park
area of Chicago for you.

14:15.500 --> 14:16.733
And you didn't even thank me.

14:16.735 --> 14:18.435
Allison, I... I didn't...

14:18.437 --> 14:19.369
Forget it.

14:19.371 --> 14:20.637
I'm out of here...

14:20.639 --> 14:23.440
in 15 minutes when my
mom comes to get me.

14:26.578 --> 14:27.644
Your hair looks clean.

14:27.647 --> 14:29.046
- Don't.
- Okay.

14:29.948 --> 14:31.614
After all we've been through,

14:31.616 --> 14:33.883
you bring Marco to our restaurant?

14:33.885 --> 14:35.051
You know him?

14:35.053 --> 14:37.454
Yeah, he's the manager at
Clive's apartment complex.

14:37.456 --> 14:38.555
I'm also a tenant.

14:38.557 --> 14:40.056
You guys got to try this bruschetta.

14:40.058 --> 14:41.658
- It's amazing.
- Yeah, we know.

14:41.660 --> 14:43.660
Now, wait, how did you even find me?

14:43.662 --> 14:46.229
We came upon the reservation
when we accidentally

14:46.231 --> 14:47.831
tapped the computer
mouse in your office.

14:47.833 --> 14:51.267
Hell's bells, does my privacy
mean nothing to you two?

14:51.269 --> 14:52.836
You lied about where you were.

14:52.838 --> 14:54.070
We thought you'd been taken.

14:54.072 --> 14:55.839
You see what they're doing?
They're tearing me apart.

14:55.841 --> 14:57.740
He wants a piece of me.
She wants a piece of me.

14:57.742 --> 14:59.075
I just want a piece of bruschetta.

14:59.077 --> 15:01.377
Clive, what do we do
when we get stressed?

15:01.379 --> 15:03.046
We put on our emotional tool belt.

15:03.048 --> 15:05.215
It's the only way we can
build a house of trust.

15:05.217 --> 15:08.785
I'm sorry. You're the manager
of his apartment complex?

15:08.787 --> 15:12.088
I also run the divorced-men
support group at the Hazelwood.

15:12.090 --> 15:13.656
I've been talking to
Clive, trying to help him

15:13.658 --> 15:16.459
with his anxiety about this situation.

15:16.461 --> 15:17.727
Oh, anxiety.

15:17.729 --> 15:19.629
Oh, please, there's no situation.

15:19.631 --> 15:21.331
- Clive, tell him.
- That's it.

15:22.657 --> 15:23.989
Click.

15:25.237 --> 15:26.936
I am stressed out of my mind

15:26.938 --> 15:28.538
with the two of you tearing me apart.

15:28.540 --> 15:30.673
That is why I lied to you.

15:30.675 --> 15:33.710
I know it's your first
post-divorce anniversary.

15:33.712 --> 15:34.911
If I went out with Eileen,

15:34.913 --> 15:36.913
you would be sending me
sad texts all night long.

15:36.915 --> 15:38.681
And if I went out with you,
Eileen would be sending me

15:38.683 --> 15:39.849
threatening texts all night.

15:39.851 --> 15:41.284
They're just emojis, Clive.

15:41.286 --> 15:42.986
You don't need to be defensive, Eileen.

15:42.988 --> 15:44.487
It's hard to build a house of trust

15:44.489 --> 15:45.989
on a foundation of fear.

15:45.991 --> 15:46.990
Mm.

15:46.992 --> 15:48.992
Can we be done with him now?

15:48.994 --> 15:51.837
Marco, I think I got it from here.

15:51.840 --> 15:53.120
We haven't gotten our entrees yet.

15:53.122 --> 15:56.056
Don't make me take out
my assertiveness wrench.

15:56.058 --> 15:58.726
Wow. You're even
holding it the right way.

15:58.728 --> 16:01.729
You're ready.

16:01.731 --> 16:03.330
Fly.

16:04.233 --> 16:06.600
Clive, I am so sorry we
made you feel that way.

16:06.602 --> 16:09.336
We didn't realize we were
making you choose between us.

16:09.338 --> 16:10.704
What could I do?

16:10.706 --> 16:13.240
My bestie used to be
married to my lover.

16:13.242 --> 16:14.942
- Don't say lover.
- Don't say bestie.

16:14.944 --> 16:17.544
It's not like the three of us
could ever hang out together.

16:17.546 --> 16:18.879
There's not a lot of divorced couples

16:18.881 --> 16:21.048
that want to be together
in their spare time.

16:21.050 --> 16:22.349
I don't know about that.

16:22.351 --> 16:24.284
We had a pretty good time today...

16:24.286 --> 16:26.553
Woke up, had our
slawsages, started drinking.

16:26.555 --> 16:28.389
Which led to a little light stalking

16:28.391 --> 16:31.358
and computer-hacking, and here we are.

16:31.360 --> 16:32.793
There's no reason the three of us

16:32.795 --> 16:34.495
can't hang out together sometimes.

16:34.497 --> 16:37.297
Yeah. Hey, we can be like
a three-person couple.

16:37.299 --> 16:38.532
A throuple.

16:38.534 --> 16:40.067
If you must give it a name.

16:40.069 --> 16:41.301
I must.

16:41.303 --> 16:43.637
Hey, Melissa, two-thirds
of this throuple

16:43.639 --> 16:44.972
need menus when you get a chance.

16:44.974 --> 16:46.840
She's giving us the finger.

16:46.842 --> 16:49.276
Oh, no, I think that's
actually just for me.

16:49.278 --> 16:50.177
No way.

16:50.179 --> 16:51.678
Yes, every Christmas.

16:51.680 --> 16:52.746
Okay, you're telling me

16:52.748 --> 16:54.581
you actually like classic action films?

16:54.583 --> 16:55.749
- All the "Lethal Weapons."
- Yeah.

16:55.751 --> 16:57.050
- All the "Die Hards."
- Sure.

16:57.052 --> 16:59.219
Anything before Mel Gibson
went crazy, and when...

16:59.221 --> 17:00.487
Bruce Willis had hair.

17:00.489 --> 17:02.656
Oh!

17:02.658 --> 17:04.858
You... You are like the ideal woman.

17:04.859 --> 17:06.460
I have been trying to tell people that.

17:06.462 --> 17:07.761
It's true.

17:07.762 --> 17:09.829
This is going to be a
pivotal scene in "Love Cab."

17:09.832 --> 17:11.765
Too funny.

17:11.767 --> 17:12.965
Huh, you know,

17:12.968 --> 17:14.902
I don't think I've ever
taken this way home before.

17:14.904 --> 17:16.436
Well, Richard, I like my passengers

17:16.439 --> 17:19.006
to experience new parts of the city.

17:19.008 --> 17:20.741
On our left is a gas station.

17:20.742 --> 17:22.108
And on our right is a man

17:22.111 --> 17:23.911
yelling at a garbage can on fire.

17:23.913 --> 17:25.179
Right.

17:25.181 --> 17:27.181
Well, it does seem like
it's a little out of the way.

17:27.183 --> 17:30.651
Not that I mind being stuck in
the car with such a lovely lady.

17:30.653 --> 17:32.186
Seriously, could you hop
on the freeway or something?

17:32.188 --> 17:35.055
Because I'm supposed to be
meeting my fiancÃ©e for dinner.

17:35.057 --> 17:35.989
Oh.

17:35.991 --> 17:37.858
Yeah, she is tough.

17:37.860 --> 17:39.092
You're engaged?

17:39.094 --> 17:39.993
Yeah.

17:39.995 --> 17:41.161
Jimmy, pull over.

17:42.731 --> 17:44.965
Got it! Hey, hey!

17:46.836 --> 17:48.335
- Get out.
- Really?

17:48.337 --> 17:50.571
I think it's for the best, Richard.

17:52.508 --> 17:54.775
But I don't even know where I am!

17:54.777 --> 17:57.939
Why don't you have your
fiancÃ©e pick you up, you tease?!

17:57.942 --> 17:59.680
Do you think he's gonna be okay?

17:59.682 --> 18:00.747
It's really cold out there.

18:00.749 --> 18:02.182
It sounds like a Richard problem.

18:02.184 --> 18:04.852
That is so sweet, you guys. Thank you.

18:04.854 --> 18:06.053
Don't worry, Aunt Jodi.

18:06.055 --> 18:07.654
We'll find you someone much better.

18:07.656 --> 18:08.856
Yes, we will.

18:08.858 --> 18:11.124
Now let's put this Love
Cab into hyperdrive.

18:11.126 --> 18:12.860
I just pressed the lighter,

18:12.862 --> 18:15.395
so please be careful when it pops out.

18:15.397 --> 18:16.730
Thank you.

18:20.402 --> 18:22.369
Are you sure you don't
want to wait inside?

18:22.371 --> 18:23.937
Yes, and I don't want to talk.

18:23.939 --> 18:26.006
My mom will be here any minute.

18:26.008 --> 18:27.741
Okay.

18:27.743 --> 18:30.244
But you forgot your bag.

18:30.246 --> 18:32.179
And your coat.

18:32.181 --> 18:34.581
And your keys and your
phone and your hat.

18:34.583 --> 18:36.548
I can get my scarf another time.

18:38.187 --> 18:39.520
Hey.

18:39.522 --> 18:41.288
Hey. You're back.

18:41.290 --> 18:44.157
Yeah, I dropped Christie
off and came back.

18:44.159 --> 18:45.893
Couldn't stand you being mad at me.

18:45.895 --> 18:47.861
Plus my mom's bridge
club was four bottles in

18:47.863 --> 18:50.230
and they started re-enacting
scenes from "The Good Wife."

18:50.232 --> 18:52.833
- Oh.
- Yeah.

18:52.835 --> 18:54.268
I cannot believe you didn't tell me

18:54.270 --> 18:55.802
that you lost your
virginity to Christie.

18:55.804 --> 18:57.304
I should have told you.

18:57.306 --> 18:58.572
But I didn't want you to think

18:58.574 --> 19:01.642
that what we have isn't
special because it is.

19:01.644 --> 19:05.345
I've never felt this
way about anyone before.

19:05.347 --> 19:08.081
- Really?
- Really.

19:08.083 --> 19:09.616
Me neither.

19:10.653 --> 19:14.521
Anyway, I was hoping we
could hang out tonight.

19:14.523 --> 19:18.492
I would love to.

19:18.494 --> 19:21.795
But... I was actually hoping

19:21.797 --> 19:24.498
to hang out with Allison tonight

19:24.500 --> 19:27.367
and watch "Hoarders," if she'll have me.

19:27.369 --> 19:28.602
She's listening.

19:28.604 --> 19:30.604
I wouldn't blame her if she said no.

19:30.606 --> 19:31.705
I've been a real jerk.

19:31.707 --> 19:33.574
I tried to make her into my fruit fly,

19:33.576 --> 19:39.012
but she's more than a
fly in the sky to eye,

19:39.014 --> 19:40.681
she's super fly.

19:42.084 --> 19:44.117
I have no idea what's going on.

19:44.119 --> 19:47.588
Yeah. It's sort of our thing.

19:47.590 --> 19:50.290
Okay. I'll see you tomorrow, then.

19:50.292 --> 19:52.059
Absolutely.

19:54.430 --> 19:56.263
Allison.

20:00.169 --> 20:04.638
I am really, really sorry
that I took you for granted,

20:04.640 --> 20:08.375
Allison Meredith Adler-Wong,

20:08.377 --> 20:10.344
especially 'cause you're
such a good person.

20:10.346 --> 20:12.012
You're an organ donor.

20:12.014 --> 20:13.113
You have perfect vision.

20:13.115 --> 20:15.949
You're a Costco executive member.

20:15.951 --> 20:17.651
You went through my wallet, didn't you?

20:17.653 --> 20:19.453
I did.

20:19.455 --> 20:21.254
- It's a start.
- It's a start.

20:21.256 --> 20:22.422
I'll get the skibbles.

20:22.424 --> 20:23.991
And I'll turn on "Hoarders."

20:23.993 --> 20:25.092
I hear it's rat week.

20:25.094 --> 20:26.793
Every week's rat week.

20:26.795 --> 20:27.861
Oh.

20:29.318 --> 20:31.128
If I'm going to be
driving annoying people

20:31.131 --> 20:33.463
like this around, I'm gonna
need more than our 50-50 split.

20:33.466 --> 20:35.099
Fine. 60-40.

20:35.101 --> 20:36.367
Huh, deal.

20:36.369 --> 20:38.203
You know you're the 40, right?

20:38.205 --> 20:40.038
Oh.

20:41.875 --> 20:42.974
Lightweights.

20:42.976 --> 20:44.709
All right, from now on, every Thursday

20:44.711 --> 20:45.844
is Throuple Thursday.

20:45.846 --> 20:46.978
Yes.

20:46.980 --> 20:48.446
Oh, let's go back to the tiny house

20:48.448 --> 20:49.747
for more margaritas and Jenga.

20:49.749 --> 20:51.549
Okay, but this time I'm
making the margaritas

20:51.551 --> 20:52.984
'cause yours are for little girls.

20:52.986 --> 20:55.019
I'm in.

20:55.021 --> 20:56.788
This is not what the Love Cab is for.

20:56.790 --> 20:58.723
Suck it up. We're surge-pricing.
