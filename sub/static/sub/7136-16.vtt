WEBVTT

01:46.633 --> 01:48.333
- I've been
wondering something.

01:48.400 --> 01:51.367
From the time we learn to speak
until the day we die,

01:51.433 --> 01:54.600
how many words does
the average person say?

01:54.667 --> 01:56.967
I mean, we talk
and talk and talk,

01:57.033 --> 01:58.767
filling up the Ozone,

01:58.834 --> 02:00.967
secretly hoping that
in all those syllables,

02:01.033 --> 02:03.367
we've said something
worth remembering.

02:03.433 --> 02:05.567
Deep down,
we know the truth.

02:05.633 --> 02:08.834
Most of what
we say is trash.

02:11.800 --> 02:13.033
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

02:13.100 --> 02:14.266
Where do you think
you're landing, chief?

02:14.333 --> 02:15.367
Where do you think
you're landing?

02:15.433 --> 02:16.367
- I need to
talk to Burr.

02:16.433 --> 02:17.834
- He's busy.

02:19.166 --> 02:20.800
- I'll wait.

02:20.867 --> 02:23.300
- He's never not gonna be busy
when it comes to you...

02:23.367 --> 02:24.834
Snitch.

02:36.900 --> 02:38.767
Snitch bitch.

02:46.300 --> 02:47.900
- You're not having much luck
getting the brothers

02:47.967 --> 02:49.400
to turn
against Redding.

02:49.467 --> 02:52.800
- You also said hill was gonna
kill the old bastard.

02:52.867 --> 02:55.500
- Don't worry.
Redding's gonna die...

02:55.567 --> 02:57.333
And soon.

03:00.533 --> 03:01.700
- Shakedown!

03:14.734 --> 03:17.400
- No.

03:17.467 --> 03:19.633
- That ain't mine.

03:19.700 --> 03:21.200
- Bullshit, it's not.

03:21.266 --> 03:23.767
- Hey, Murph, yo, that's not--
that ain't mine, man!

03:23.834 --> 03:24.967
- Well, it's definitely
not mine.

03:25.033 --> 03:26.800
Take him to McManus.
Take him away.

03:26.867 --> 03:28.734
- Come on, man,
that's not even--

03:31.934 --> 03:33.133
Sister,
you know me.

03:33.200 --> 03:35.033
I've been clean
for over three years.

03:35.100 --> 03:36.266
- He's not using, Tim.

03:36.333 --> 03:37.767
I would stake
my reputation on that.

03:37.834 --> 03:39.567
- If you're not using,
then you're selling.

03:39.633 --> 03:40.700
- No!

03:40.767 --> 03:42.900
Somebody planted
that shit in my pod!

03:42.967 --> 03:45.066
- Why?
- I don't know.

03:45.133 --> 03:46.767
- Do the tits
belong to White?

03:46.834 --> 03:48.033
- No!

03:48.100 --> 03:49.633
- Then who are you protecting?
- Nobody!

03:49.700 --> 03:51.867
- All right, I'm gonna
put you back in Em City,

03:51.934 --> 03:52.967
only with
no punishment.

03:53.033 --> 03:54.333
This way all your
little friends

03:54.400 --> 03:56.233
will think that
you ratted on them, again.

03:56.300 --> 03:57.734
- MacManus, put me
in the hole.

03:57.800 --> 03:59.000
- Officer.

03:59.066 --> 04:00.800
- MacManus, put me in
the fucking hole!

04:19.900 --> 04:21.467
- You see what
I'm saying?

04:21.533 --> 04:24.600
Redding's the one that put
them drugs in your cell.

04:24.667 --> 04:26.000
- Maybe you
arranged that.

04:26.066 --> 04:28.166
Fuck, I don't know
who  to trust.

04:28.233 --> 04:29.333
- It don't matter.

04:29.400 --> 04:31.266
Redding don't
trust you...

04:31.333 --> 04:33.734
Never will.

04:33.800 --> 04:34.934
You've only got
one choice.

04:35.000 --> 04:37.233
Grease him.

04:37.300 --> 04:40.100
- I kill Redding,
then you take charge.

04:40.166 --> 04:42.100
- And I won't forget
what you done.

04:42.166 --> 04:43.900
- Well, I haven't
forgotten what you've done,

04:43.967 --> 04:45.567
jabbering to
the cops on me.

04:45.633 --> 04:47.700
- I told you I'm trying
to make that shit up to you.

04:47.767 --> 04:50.000
- And I told you to
leave me the fuck alone!

04:54.200 --> 04:58.367
- You know I'm done trying
to please you, Augustus.

04:58.433 --> 05:00.467
I'm gonna take care
of business myself.

05:04.300 --> 05:05.633
- No, don't!

05:05.700 --> 05:07.700
Supreme, supreme.

05:07.767 --> 05:11.033
I'll kill him.

05:11.100 --> 05:13.100
Look, if he's gonna die,
I'd rather he die at my hands.

05:13.166 --> 05:14.800
I'll make sure
it won't hurt.

05:14.867 --> 05:17.967
- Whatever.
Just do the deed.

05:25.600 --> 05:28.300
- Hardin.
- You wanted to see me?

05:28.367 --> 05:30.033
- You still
working bedpan?

05:30.100 --> 05:31.567
- Uh-huh.

05:33.166 --> 05:36.266
- I need some
medical records.

05:39.400 --> 05:41.000
Poet?

05:41.066 --> 05:42.467
Yo, Poet?

05:42.533 --> 05:44.266
- Don't be talking to me,
snitch.

05:44.333 --> 05:47.100
As far as we're concerned,
you're a dead man, a ghost.

05:47.166 --> 05:48.333
A ghost on wheels.

05:48.400 --> 05:49.433
- Hey, listen, man.

05:49.500 --> 05:50.767
I'm trying to
save Burr's life.

05:50.834 --> 05:52.633
- What you talking about,
man?

05:52.700 --> 05:54.266
- Supreme Allah...

05:54.333 --> 05:56.734
I remember back
on the corner

05:56.800 --> 05:58.767
he used to be crazy
allergic to something.

05:58.834 --> 06:03.233
According to his records,
it's eggs.

06:03.300 --> 06:05.400
- Yeah, when we be
prepping his meals,

06:05.467 --> 06:07.266
we gotta fix his shit
real special.

06:07.333 --> 06:09.400
- Not today.

06:15.300 --> 06:16.467
- Eat hardy.

06:23.734 --> 06:26.200
- That bitch Burr's
still alive, Augustus.

06:26.266 --> 06:27.767
What's up with that?

06:27.834 --> 06:30.100
- I gotta get
close him, don't I?

06:30.166 --> 06:33.000
I gotta get back
in his good graces.

06:33.066 --> 06:35.500
That's gonna
take some time.

06:36.900 --> 06:39.500
- Well, you ain't
got time.

06:49.367 --> 06:50.300
- Something wrong?

07:02.533 --> 07:03.967
- Oh, shit.

07:04.033 --> 07:07.600
- You did this,
didn't you?

07:09.300 --> 07:10.467
You fucking--

07:10.533 --> 07:12.166
oh!

07:43.033 --> 07:45.166
- Poet told me
what you done.

07:45.233 --> 07:49.934
I came to thank you and
welcome you back into the fold.

07:51.200 --> 07:54.100
- I accept
your thanks.

07:56.633 --> 07:58.533
But I don't want
to be back in.

07:58.600 --> 08:01.133
I don't want
to sell drugs.

08:01.200 --> 08:03.000
- Your choice.

08:03.066 --> 08:05.400
I respect that.

08:05.467 --> 08:06.700
- Respect?

08:06.767 --> 08:09.767
I killed a man today.

08:09.834 --> 08:12.800
I caused his death
to happen.

08:12.867 --> 08:14.767
And even though Allah
was gonna hurt you,

08:14.834 --> 08:17.100
even though the motherfucker
screwed me to this chair,

08:17.166 --> 08:20.667
I don't feel good
about what I done.

08:22.500 --> 08:25.800
- Well, then, Augustus...

08:25.867 --> 08:27.433
I raised you right.

08:41.500 --> 08:42.934
- My daughter's
coming today.

08:43.000 --> 08:44.900
Says she has something
important to tell me.

08:44.967 --> 08:47.266
- Well, when you
finish your visit,

08:47.333 --> 08:50.033
I need you to
perform a task.

08:50.100 --> 08:51.133
- Like I said...

08:51.200 --> 08:53.400
I'm here for you.

08:54.433 --> 08:56.533
- Airhole Morales.

08:57.100 --> 08:59.600
- What about Pancamo?

08:59.667 --> 09:04.500
- His time will come,
but Morales goes first.

09:10.967 --> 09:12.433
- Hey.

09:12.500 --> 09:14.367
- Patricia.

09:19.900 --> 09:21.333
So, what'd you
want to tell me?

09:21.400 --> 09:24.333
- Jeez, Dad, no "How are you?
How's your mom?"

09:24.400 --> 09:25.600
- Is it bad news?

09:25.667 --> 09:26.633
You're not leaving
the corps, are you?

09:26.700 --> 09:30.533
- Stop looking so grim.

09:30.600 --> 09:32.367
I'm getting married.

09:33.266 --> 09:34.633
- Married?

09:34.700 --> 09:36.400
To Max?

09:36.467 --> 09:37.867
- Of course,
to Max.

09:37.934 --> 09:40.767
- That's wonderful news,
sweetheart,

09:40.834 --> 09:41.867
I'm so happy for you.

09:41.934 --> 09:44.700
- Thanks.

09:44.767 --> 09:48.767
Dad...
The thing is...

09:48.834 --> 09:52.166
Since you won't be there
to walk me down the aisle,

09:52.233 --> 09:54.266
I was gonna ask Miran.

09:54.333 --> 09:58.066
I know how you
feel about him.

09:58.133 --> 10:00.834
But he and mom have
been married 20 years.

10:00.900 --> 10:03.300
I grew up
in his house.

10:07.700 --> 10:09.133
- I got work detail.

10:09.200 --> 10:11.800
- Dad, I need
your answer.

10:13.700 --> 10:15.934
- Do whatever
the fuck you want.

10:26.433 --> 10:28.033
- The goddamn thing
stopped dead.

10:28.100 --> 10:29.767
We were able to get
the warden out,

10:29.834 --> 10:31.333
but he wants it fixed,
pronto.

10:31.400 --> 10:32.900
You guys both
work mechanical,

10:32.967 --> 10:34.333
so, we figured
you could take a look.

10:34.400 --> 10:35.600
- When I was a kid,

10:35.667 --> 10:37.200
I used to work for Otis
fixing elevators.

10:37.266 --> 10:39.867
I know these suckers
backwards and forwards.

10:39.934 --> 10:41.567
- Whoa there, Otis.

10:49.533 --> 10:50.700
Were you in
the cafeteria

10:50.767 --> 10:52.166
when that colored guy
bought the farm?

10:52.233 --> 10:53.200
- Supreme Allah?

10:53.266 --> 10:54.367
Yeah.

10:54.433 --> 10:55.467
Talk about
bugging out.

10:55.533 --> 10:56.767
Hand me a wrench.

10:56.834 --> 10:58.934
- Life's pretty precarious
around here.

10:59.000 --> 11:00.834
- Yeah.

11:00.900 --> 11:02.667
Even more so
than in 'Nam?

11:02.734 --> 11:04.734
- The land mines in Oz
are even less visible.

11:04.800 --> 11:08.900
Friends turn on friends,
enemies buddy up.

11:10.100 --> 11:13.033
I'm not used to that
kind of behavior.

11:13.100 --> 11:15.133
I like to know
who my adversaries are.

11:16.133 --> 11:17.367
- Ooh!

11:29.900 --> 11:31.500
Be all you can be,
babe.

11:44.900 --> 11:48.200
- When someone dies, we look at
the last thing he or she said

11:48.266 --> 11:50.867
in hopes of finding
a summation of life,

11:50.934 --> 11:54.767
a deep truth that those of us
above ground can cling to.

11:54.834 --> 11:57.767
Like the novelist
Daniel Defoe,

11:57.834 --> 11:59.867
"I do not know which
is more difficult,

11:59.934 --> 12:02.700
to live well or to die well."

12:02.767 --> 12:07.333
In Oz, we do neither.

12:07.400 --> 12:09.266
- Jeremiah, the purpose
for my visit is...

12:12.367 --> 12:15.033
And I wanted to do
this face-to-face.

12:16.867 --> 12:18.600
The board of elders
met yesterday

12:18.667 --> 12:20.867
and decided to ask you
for your resignation

12:20.934 --> 12:23.000
as head of
the New Church of Christ.

12:27.166 --> 12:30.033
- The elders voted unanimously
on the day of my conviction

12:30.100 --> 12:33.266
that they would stand behind me,
to support me no matter what.

12:33.333 --> 12:36.000
- I know, but the scandal
has severely damaged

12:36.066 --> 12:38.266
our fund-raising efforts.

12:38.333 --> 12:40.967
- I want to talk
to the elders.

12:41.033 --> 12:42.900
- How, via satellite?

12:42.967 --> 12:44.700
- They can come
here to Oz.

12:44.767 --> 12:46.033
- Oh, Jeremiah,
be serious.

12:46.100 --> 12:48.667
Those old men are
not coming here.

12:52.133 --> 12:53.700
Letter of resignation.

12:59.433 --> 13:00.467
Sign.

13:19.033 --> 13:20.333
- All I'm saying is
Cloutier thinks

13:20.400 --> 13:21.567
he's better than
all of us.

13:21.633 --> 13:23.133
- How do you mean?

13:23.200 --> 13:24.867
- Warden's got us doing
physical labor, right?

13:24.934 --> 13:28.066
Cloutier's got a cushy job
in the requisitions office.

13:28.133 --> 13:31.333
We're loading cement;
he's pushing a pen.

13:31.400 --> 13:33.667
He should be
slaving alongside us.

13:33.734 --> 13:35.633
- Sowing more seeds
of discontent?

13:35.700 --> 13:38.200
- Just telling
my friends what's what.

13:38.266 --> 13:39.834
- Get up.

13:39.900 --> 13:41.100
- Did I ever mention why
he threw me

13:41.166 --> 13:43.200
out of the congregation?

13:43.266 --> 13:47.600
Not because I threatened someone
in the name of the Lord,

13:47.667 --> 13:49.567
but because
I disagreed with him.

13:49.633 --> 13:52.433
He tries to silence anyone
whose opinions differ.

13:52.500 --> 13:54.500
- Jim, escort this man out.

13:54.567 --> 13:56.967
- He has the right to
finish his thought.

13:58.767 --> 14:01.633
- All right...

14:01.700 --> 14:03.467
Let him speak.

14:07.500 --> 14:08.967
- Excuse me one second.

14:09.834 --> 14:11.433
Hoyt...

14:11.500 --> 14:14.100
You still looking to do the
Reverend Cloutier some harm?

14:14.166 --> 14:15.333
- Why?

14:15.400 --> 14:17.734
You want him dead?

14:17.800 --> 14:19.166
- Not...

14:19.233 --> 14:21.934
Dead, exactly.

14:36.800 --> 14:38.467
- You looking for this?

14:39.867 --> 14:41.200
- Give me the towel.

14:46.300 --> 14:48.900
And so, this proves what,
that you're stronger than me?

14:48.967 --> 14:51.800
In brute strength, maybe,

14:51.867 --> 14:55.567
but I got the power
of Jesus on my side.

14:55.633 --> 14:57.266
- Well, good.

14:57.333 --> 15:00.266
Then have the Lord Jesus
get you another towel.

15:29.400 --> 15:34.900
- when I was 10, my father
was a tent revival preacher.

15:35.000 --> 15:35.934
He called me up
onstage.

15:36.000 --> 15:39.166
I was 10 years old.

15:39.233 --> 15:42.934
I touched the eyes of
a blind man and he was healed.

15:43.967 --> 15:46.567
From that moment on,
I was special, famous.

15:46.633 --> 15:48.834
Everywhere I went,
on TV...

15:48.900 --> 15:50.467
Crowds of people
wanting to touch me.

15:50.533 --> 15:51.967
- Wow.

15:52.033 --> 15:53.834
That must be something.

15:53.900 --> 15:58.500
- Fame became all that I knew,
penthouses, limousines.

15:59.100 --> 16:01.633
When I took the money
from my congregation,

16:01.700 --> 16:03.433
I didn't even think
that I was stealing.

16:03.500 --> 16:06.400
It seemed like I was taking
what was rightfully mine.

16:09.066 --> 16:10.100
Listen to me.

16:12.400 --> 16:13.433
Pride.

16:13.500 --> 16:15.934
Pride is the worst sin

16:16.000 --> 16:18.767
for it is pride that
separates us from God.

16:18.834 --> 16:20.934
- Deliverance
comes from Jesus.

16:21.000 --> 16:24.300
- Yes...

16:24.367 --> 16:25.867
And he has humbled me.

16:25.934 --> 16:29.600
- In order to win
your congregation back,

16:29.667 --> 16:31.433
you must show them that
you're not their superior,

16:31.500 --> 16:32.967
but their equal.

16:33.033 --> 16:35.467
- How do I do that?

16:35.533 --> 16:37.900
- By joining them
in their work.

16:37.967 --> 16:41.834
"The labor of the righteous
tendeth to life."

16:46.433 --> 16:48.734
- The last three words
spoken by Jesus were,

16:48.800 --> 16:50.567
"It is finished."

16:50.633 --> 16:52.834
Now, being
the Son of God,

16:52.900 --> 16:54.233
He probably knew
the end was coming

16:54.300 --> 16:56.567
and had a chance
to consider what to say.

16:56.633 --> 16:58.300
The rest of us
don't get that luxury.

16:58.367 --> 17:00.433
When death comes,
it's a surprise,

17:00.500 --> 17:03.367
and we gotta improvise.

17:03.433 --> 17:06.700
- I have to tell you, Cloutier,
you really impressed me.

17:06.767 --> 17:08.633
You really
heeded the call.

17:08.700 --> 17:10.200
Your followers
are tickled to death

17:10.266 --> 17:11.667
you're helping me
build this wall.

17:11.734 --> 17:13.000
- Please, son,
I beg you.

17:13.066 --> 17:14.567
Think about what it is
that you're doing.

17:14.633 --> 17:16.266
- Oh, I've thought
about this completely.

17:16.333 --> 17:19.300
When the hacks ask
where you are, I'll say,

17:19.367 --> 17:20.734
"I don't know.

17:20.800 --> 17:22.333
Maybe the good reverend
ascended into heaven."

17:23.700 --> 17:24.633
- Help!

17:24.700 --> 17:26.633
Help, help me!

17:26.700 --> 17:29.200
- They can't help you.
Nobody's here, remember?

17:29.266 --> 17:33.867
- Yeah, and I paid the hacks an
extra 200 bucks to take a hike.

17:33.934 --> 17:36.867
- You're both gonna burn in hell
for all eternity.

17:36.934 --> 17:39.967
- You should've just taken
the blow job when I offered it.

17:40.033 --> 17:41.166
- Help!

17:41.233 --> 17:42.667
Help me!

17:42.734 --> 17:44.000
Help!

17:44.066 --> 17:45.800
Help me!

17:45.867 --> 17:47.367
Help!

17:56.700 --> 18:00.867
The Lord is my shepherd,
I shall not want.

18:08.500 --> 18:10.367
He leadeth me in
the path of righteousness

18:10.433 --> 18:11.967
for His namesake, yea.

18:12.033 --> 18:17.667
Though I walk through the valley
of the shadow of death,

18:17.734 --> 18:19.767
I will fear no evil!

18:33.200 --> 18:35.800
Oh, fuck!

18:36.767 --> 18:38.333
- Hughes?

18:38.400 --> 18:41.233
- Hey, I don't
feel too good.

18:44.300 --> 18:46.700
Fuck!

18:46.767 --> 18:48.700
- What's the symptoms,
buddy?

19:14.400 --> 19:16.700
- Hey, you stupid fucks,
listen up!

19:16.767 --> 19:20.233
I hereby declare this unit
the Republic of Huhru.

19:20.300 --> 19:21.867
Huhru, Huhru, Huhru!

19:21.934 --> 19:23.367
- What, are you
fucking crazy?

19:23.433 --> 19:25.033
- Until such time
as we can organize

19:25.100 --> 19:27.033
free and fair elections,

19:27.100 --> 19:28.600
I have assumed command!

19:28.667 --> 19:30.600
You shall henceforth,
and to wit,

19:30.667 --> 19:32.734
refer to me
as "your excellency."

19:32.800 --> 19:34.767
Alvarez: You're a fucking
nut job!

19:34.834 --> 19:36.367
- For that insubordination,
Alvarez,

19:36.433 --> 19:37.934
you shall remain
inside your cell.

19:38.000 --> 19:41.567
In fact, until all of you
have proven your loyalties

19:41.633 --> 19:43.333
to our new republic...

19:43.400 --> 19:47.400
And to the principles
stated in my manifesto,

19:47.467 --> 19:50.033
you shall stay
right where you are.

19:51.233 --> 19:53.166
- Hey, open the
fucking door!

19:53.233 --> 19:55.533
- Get a fucking C.O.
In here!

19:57.033 --> 19:59.467
- You fuckin' psycho!

20:00.567 --> 20:02.800
- Central, this is
Gamba Kufu,

20:02.867 --> 20:05.266
acting president of
the Republic of Huhru.

20:05.333 --> 20:08.133
I want to speak to
warden Leo Glynn.

20:11.500 --> 20:13.767
- Hello?

20:13.834 --> 20:16.900
Yes.
Oh, I'll tell him.

20:18.367 --> 20:19.934
- You better stop
this nonsense

20:20.000 --> 20:21.667
and give yourself up
right now.

20:21.734 --> 20:23.266
- And you better stop
your yapping, Smith,

20:23.333 --> 20:25.934
or you're gonna find my dick
burrowing towards your prostate.

20:26.000 --> 20:30.266
- Clayton,
this is Leo.

20:30.333 --> 20:31.800
- You shall refer to me as
"Gamba Kufu"

20:31.867 --> 20:34.066
or "your excellency."

20:34.133 --> 20:35.767
- Clayton...
- Gamba!

20:35.834 --> 20:37.367
- How's Officer Smith?

20:37.433 --> 20:40.333
- Well, that depends
on you.

20:41.767 --> 20:43.700
- Listen to me,
clayton...

20:43.767 --> 20:44.800
- Gamba.

20:44.867 --> 20:45.967
- Clayton!

20:46.033 --> 20:47.533
- Until you begin
addressing me

20:47.600 --> 20:49.200
with the respect
befitting my high office,

20:49.266 --> 20:51.300
I am terminating
this conversation.

20:55.600 --> 20:56.867
- Do you have the key?

20:56.934 --> 20:57.967
- On its way.

20:58.033 --> 20:59.600
- I want you to
unlock the door.

20:59.667 --> 21:01.300
I'm gonna
go in first.

21:01.367 --> 21:02.467
- I wouldn't
recommend that, sir.

21:02.533 --> 21:04.166
- This isn't heroics,
commander.

21:04.233 --> 21:07.200
It's good
old-fashioned guilt.

21:09.400 --> 21:11.900
- Hey, your excellency.

21:11.967 --> 21:16.066
You seem to have
everything under control,

21:16.133 --> 21:17.700
only I want to make sure you
don't get the rest of us killed

21:17.767 --> 21:19.967
and I want to know
what your plan is.

21:21.266 --> 21:22.533
- My plan?

21:22.600 --> 21:24.033
- Yeah, 'cause I remember
during the riot

21:24.100 --> 21:25.266
that happened
a few years ago,

21:25.333 --> 21:27.000
Said, Adebisi,
and the rest of them,

21:27.066 --> 21:29.133
they created a strategy.

21:29.200 --> 21:31.333
- Penders,
your experience

21:31.400 --> 21:34.000
makes you invaluable
to the revolution.

21:42.533 --> 21:45.367
I hereby name you
my acting vice president.

21:45.433 --> 21:46.700
- Oh, I'm honored.

21:46.767 --> 21:47.967
- Ready to take
the oath of office?

21:48.033 --> 21:49.467
- I don't think
we have time for that,

21:49.533 --> 21:51.133
'cause any moment the sort boys
are gonna burst in here,

21:51.200 --> 21:52.533
and they're gonna
mow us down.

21:52.600 --> 21:54.400
- Like Napoleon
back from Elba,

21:54.467 --> 21:56.767
I shall speak to the men and
convince them to join our side.

21:56.834 --> 21:59.300
- Okay, but if that
doesn't work,

21:59.367 --> 22:01.967
you might want to consider
using your hostage as a shield.

22:02.033 --> 22:03.233
- Excellent idea.

22:03.300 --> 22:04.300
- Yeah.

22:04.367 --> 22:06.367
Fuck, here they come!

22:13.700 --> 22:15.900
- Hello, Leo.

22:15.967 --> 22:18.066
Welcome to Huhru.

22:18.133 --> 22:20.066
- I've never lied to you,
have I?

22:23.600 --> 22:26.734
Then I want you to listen
carefully to what I say.

22:26.800 --> 22:29.767
The thoughts in your mind
aren't real.

22:29.834 --> 22:31.934
You spent too much
time alone.

22:32.000 --> 22:34.867
You created a world
in your head.

22:34.934 --> 22:38.200
There is no Huhru.

22:38.266 --> 22:40.900
Your name is
Clayton Hughes.

22:40.967 --> 22:43.600
- I am Gamba Kufu.

22:43.667 --> 22:45.367
- Your name...

22:45.433 --> 22:48.166
Is Clayton Hughes,

22:48.233 --> 22:49.800
and you're lost.

22:49.867 --> 22:52.066
I want to help you.

22:54.767 --> 22:56.734
- I remember
the day my...

22:58.033 --> 23:00.433
Dad died,
I felt this way.

23:02.400 --> 23:05.834
I remember you and me
in the hospital,

23:05.900 --> 23:07.367
you hugging me.

23:11.400 --> 23:13.400
I miss those hugs, Leo.

23:16.500 --> 23:18.734
Will you
hug me now?

23:26.500 --> 23:29.800
I'll give up if you
hug me right now.

23:29.867 --> 23:31.834
- All right.

23:34.767 --> 23:36.433
It's all right,
Clayton.

23:36.500 --> 23:38.200
It's gonna
be all right.

23:42.800 --> 23:43.734
- Hey!

23:45.734 --> 23:47.300
- Commander!

23:52.133 --> 23:54.166
- Oh, fuck!

23:55.233 --> 23:57.133
- I saved your
fucking life, Glynn!

23:57.200 --> 23:58.200
You owe me!

23:58.266 --> 24:00.233
You owe me!

24:03.600 --> 24:06.233
- Clayton.

24:06.300 --> 24:08.000
Clayton, my God.

24:09.333 --> 24:11.000
- My plan worked...

24:11.066 --> 24:12.533
Perfectly.

24:14.033 --> 24:16.100
Hug me, Leo.

24:16.667 --> 24:18.600
- Okay, it's okay.

24:18.667 --> 24:20.400
- Hug me, Leo.

24:20.467 --> 24:22.333
Hug me.

24:25.500 --> 24:26.700
Hug me.

24:26.767 --> 24:28.567
- Oh, my God.

24:31.033 --> 24:33.867
- Not everybody
leaves this mortal coil

24:33.934 --> 24:35.066
miserable and confused.

24:35.133 --> 24:36.400
Ethel Waters said,

24:36.467 --> 24:38.467
"I'm not afraid
to die, honey.

24:38.533 --> 24:40.633
"In fact, I'm kind of
looking forward to it.

24:40.700 --> 24:42.734
"I know that the Lord
has His arms

24:42.800 --> 24:45.200
wrapped around
this big, fat sparrow."

24:52.867 --> 24:54.333
- I'm heading out
for the night,

24:54.400 --> 24:56.567
unless you need me
to do something.

24:56.633 --> 25:00.233
- Today, I had to call
my best friend's widow...

25:00.300 --> 25:04.433
And inform her that
her only child was dead,

25:04.500 --> 25:07.266
that he died in my arms
the same as his father.

25:07.333 --> 25:10.333
I don't ever want
to have to make

25:10.400 --> 25:12.433
another call like that again.

25:12.500 --> 25:15.266
There is one last thing
you can do.

25:15.333 --> 25:17.300
Take a letter.

25:26.133 --> 25:30.934
"To Martin Douglas,

25:31.000 --> 25:33.467
"Commissioner
Bureau of Prisons.

25:33.533 --> 25:36.767
"Dear Martin,
I resign as warden

25:36.834 --> 25:39.734
"of Oswald State
Correctional Facility,

25:39.800 --> 25:43.433
effective as soon as
a replacement can be found."

25:45.567 --> 25:46.834
Why'd you
stop writing?

25:46.900 --> 25:48.367
- Because you don't
mean it.

25:48.433 --> 25:50.900
- Oh, I do, Floria.

25:52.567 --> 25:54.133
It's time for me
to move on...

25:54.200 --> 25:56.633
Move up, move out.

25:56.700 --> 25:58.533
- No, but you do
a lot of good here.

25:58.600 --> 26:01.033
- I do shit!

26:02.533 --> 26:03.600
That letter goes out

26:03.667 --> 26:05.433
first thing tomorrow.

26:05.500 --> 26:07.300
- Well, why don't
we have dinner?

26:07.367 --> 26:11.467
- No, that's okay.

26:11.533 --> 26:14.400
- Well, I'm not gonna
leave you like this.

26:14.467 --> 26:17.266
- I'm headed over
to see Clayton's mom.

26:17.333 --> 26:19.300
My wife's
already there.

26:19.367 --> 26:21.667
We'll sit together

26:21.734 --> 26:24.166
and cry.

26:24.233 --> 26:25.967
Remember the good times

26:26.033 --> 26:28.400
and try to make sense
out of...

26:29.433 --> 26:31.700
what is senseless.

26:37.567 --> 26:39.133
Good night.

27:00.033 --> 27:02.567
- Any news on how
Dave Brass is doing?

27:02.633 --> 27:04.300
- Yeah, he's out of
the hospital,

27:04.367 --> 27:06.934
but his leg's all fucked up.

27:07.000 --> 27:09.066
He's never gonna
play basketball again.

27:13.033 --> 27:14.700
- Heard the last game
was called off.

27:14.767 --> 27:16.834
Glynn told me
that was your decision.

27:16.900 --> 27:19.600
- So, what's
the difference?

27:22.333 --> 27:23.934
- I want to take
Dave Brass' place.

27:24.000 --> 27:25.433
- What?

27:25.500 --> 27:27.533
- I want you and I to play
the last game together.

27:27.600 --> 27:28.867
- Fuck you!

27:28.934 --> 27:31.000
- Because I turned
you down before?

27:31.066 --> 27:32.100
- That's right!

27:32.166 --> 27:33.533
- Okay, well,
fuck me for that!

27:33.600 --> 27:35.667
But listen, Tim, you made
a believer out of me, man.

27:35.734 --> 27:36.900
- Huh?

27:36.967 --> 27:38.633
- I was watching.

27:38.700 --> 27:39.800
You played balls out with a lot
of fucking heart

27:39.867 --> 27:41.700
in both those games.

27:41.767 --> 27:43.100
But Brass, he was
a phenomenal player.

27:43.166 --> 27:44.367
I don't think anybody
really noticed

27:44.433 --> 27:45.667
how good you
were playing.

27:45.734 --> 27:47.200
And isn't that the whole
point of all this?

27:47.266 --> 27:49.100
I mean, to show
the dinks in here

27:49.166 --> 27:50.900
that if a guy puts
his mind to something...

27:50.967 --> 27:52.934
- We can't win.
- I know.

27:53.000 --> 27:54.467
But if we could
hold our own,

27:54.533 --> 27:57.333
two average white guys
with bad bodies,

27:57.400 --> 27:59.133
hanging with Vahue.

27:59.200 --> 28:01.600

I think I can help you,

but I'm not giving up
on you, Omar.

29:27.967 --> 29:31.200
You understand?
I'm not giving up.

29:31.266 --> 29:32.700
- Thank you.

29:36.533 --> 29:38.266
- Hey, yo, Omar.

29:38.333 --> 29:39.834
What's up, man?

29:39.900 --> 29:43.166
- Oh, man, you know I don't fuck
around with that shit no more.

29:43.233 --> 29:45.700
Call me Mr. Clean
around here, man.

29:50.033 --> 29:51.000
- Morning.

29:51.066 --> 29:53.300
- Hey, my man,
mac daddy McManus.

29:53.367 --> 29:54.667
How you doing, man?
How was your weekend?

29:54.734 --> 29:55.867
- It was good.

29:55.934 --> 29:57.066
I got a lot
of work done.

29:57.133 --> 29:59.233
- Work?
What, no play?

29:59.300 --> 30:01.233
You ain't have no, like,
romantic interludes?

30:01.300 --> 30:02.734
- Well, sure.

30:02.800 --> 30:05.233
Saturday night I took out
this Portuguese dancer.

30:05.300 --> 30:07.100
- What, a stripper?

30:07.166 --> 30:08.600
- No, no,
ballet, ballet.

30:08.667 --> 30:10.266
- Ballet?

30:10.333 --> 30:12.600
Oh, man, them ballet bitches,
they too skinny and shit, man.

30:12.667 --> 30:14.467
They be looking like
teenage boys and shit.

30:14.533 --> 30:16.066
You gotta
get you a stripper.

30:16.133 --> 30:18.300
- I'll see you,
okay, Omar?

30:18.367 --> 30:19.300
- Can I go up
with you?

30:19.367 --> 30:20.900
- Well, you know, no,

30:20.967 --> 30:24.500
just let me get
settled for a while, okay?

30:25.900 --> 30:27.300
- Okay, okay.

30:27.367 --> 30:28.533
- Is there a problem?

30:28.600 --> 30:30.100
Is there something
that can't wait?

30:30.166 --> 30:34.333
- It's just, you know,
I'm feeling a little shaky,

30:34.400 --> 30:35.600
you know
what I mean.

30:35.667 --> 30:38.433
- Yeah, okay,
come on up.

30:38.500 --> 30:40.333
Come on, come on.

30:40.400 --> 30:42.900
- Yeah, like I was saying,
you gotta get you a stripper.

30:42.967 --> 30:44.834
I used to have this stripper,
a bitch named Angelina.

30:44.900 --> 30:46.133
Boy, whoo-hoo!

30:46.200 --> 30:47.567
And that bitch
could suck a dick, too.

30:47.633 --> 30:48.767
- Oh, well...

30:49.333 --> 30:51.533
Omar's been off
the drugs for weeks now.

30:51.600 --> 30:54.333
He goes to rehab regular,
he goes to class,

30:54.400 --> 30:55.900
he does his
work assignments.

30:55.967 --> 30:58.066
He's become
the model prisoner.

30:58.133 --> 30:59.567
- And he's
driving you crazy.

30:59.633 --> 31:00.900
- Yes!

31:00.967 --> 31:02.967
Whenever I'm in Em City,
he follows me around,

31:03.033 --> 31:05.000
everywhere,
like a two-year-old.

31:05.066 --> 31:07.000
And he goes on and on
about nothing.

31:07.066 --> 31:09.367
- So, tell the jerk
to beat it.

31:09.433 --> 31:10.633
- And risk him
sliding back?

31:10.700 --> 31:11.800
No way.

31:11.867 --> 31:13.033
- Well, then,
as the French say,

31:13.100 --> 31:16.800
you are up shit's creek
sans paddle.

31:16.867 --> 31:18.266
- For the second
straight week,

31:18.333 --> 31:20.633
we have a new contestant
and a new celebrity.

31:20.700 --> 31:22.433
In fact, a man who's been
let out of jail

31:22.500 --> 31:24.333
especially
for the show.

31:24.400 --> 31:26.166
- What?

31:26.233 --> 31:30.133
- Motherfucking McManus
starring up on TV.

31:30.200 --> 31:32.333
- And I want to introduce
our young star today.

31:32.400 --> 31:35.667
He's the other Tony Soprano,
Robert Iler.

31:35.734 --> 31:36.734
Robert, thank you...

31:36.800 --> 31:38.033
- We gotta
get cable, man.

31:38.100 --> 31:40.066
We are missing out
on all the good shit.

31:40.133 --> 31:42.633
- Hey, yo, I hear the women
on "Sex and the City"

31:42.700 --> 31:44.100
are hot, son.

31:44.166 --> 31:45.533
Hot!

31:45.600 --> 31:47.200
- I'd fuck that
Sarah-whatever-her-name-is.

31:47.266 --> 31:48.834
- Would you guys just
shut the fuck up, please?

31:48.900 --> 31:50.300
Shit!

31:50.367 --> 31:52.667
- We start off with $10,
and the category today,

31:52.734 --> 31:54.533
Tim, is vocabulary.

31:54.600 --> 31:55.867
And the question is:

31:55.934 --> 31:58.266
what is a tittle?

31:58.333 --> 31:59.900
- I think I know this.

31:59.967 --> 32:02.900
I'm gonna humor you,
I'm gonna ask for a hint.

32:02.967 --> 32:06.834
Did you cover this in
sixth grade English, Robert?

32:06.900 --> 32:08.367
- Well, first off,
I'm in high school.

32:08.433 --> 32:10.500
And yeah,
they did cover this...

32:10.567 --> 32:11.934
In the third grade.

32:12.000 --> 32:13.233
- Would you like to give
him a hint, Robert?

32:13.300 --> 32:15.800
- It comes with crosses
on T's.

32:15.867 --> 32:18.800
- I saw a show where
they were discussing tittles,

32:18.867 --> 32:21.066
and it wasn't
punctuation.

32:21.133 --> 32:22.266
- Yeah, it's not
punctuation.

32:22.333 --> 32:24.300
It's a diacritical mark.

32:24.367 --> 32:25.567
- Kid's right.

32:25.633 --> 32:27.100
- You're a good guy,
Robert,

32:27.166 --> 32:28.867
but I've been around
a little longer.

32:28.934 --> 32:32.133
A tittle is
a breast implant.

32:32.200 --> 32:34.266
- Leave it to McManus
to go for breasts.

32:34.333 --> 32:36.700
- No, in fact, it is
the dot above an "I."

32:40.734 --> 32:42.033
- Dumb ass.

32:42.100 --> 32:43.333
- I always knew
McManus was an idiot.

32:43.400 --> 32:44.967
Now everybody
else does, too.

32:45.033 --> 32:47.400
- Yo, man, don't be fucking
dogging McManus out, all right?

32:47.467 --> 32:49.066
- Oh, I'm sorry, White.

32:49.133 --> 32:51.500
I forgot you've been sucking
his cock these days.

32:51.567 --> 32:54.233
- I'm not sucking
his cock, faggot.

32:54.300 --> 32:55.700
- Then...

32:55.767 --> 32:57.667
You must be
taking it up the ass.

33:00.233 --> 33:01.433
- You mother...

33:05.500 --> 33:06.667
- Shit!
Oh, shit!

33:08.700 --> 33:10.133
- Motherfucker!

33:10.200 --> 33:12.367
- Central, this is 11,
we got a 66.

33:12.433 --> 33:14.900
- Let's go, move it,
get the fuck outta here!

33:17.667 --> 33:19.767
- Pedro Calderon died.

33:19.834 --> 33:21.800
- The fuckin' spic
came at me.

33:21.867 --> 33:23.533
- Yeah, after you
charged Guerra!

33:23.600 --> 33:25.567
- Who was
making fun of you!

33:25.633 --> 33:28.066
- Well, the warden
wants you in solitary.

33:28.133 --> 33:30.000
- You said you'd never
give up on me.

33:30.066 --> 33:32.233
You said you'd never
let 'em take me back.

33:32.300 --> 33:34.166
- I tried.

33:34.233 --> 33:37.033
I argued as best
I could, I lost.

33:37.100 --> 33:40.233
- I won't fucking survive
in solitary, you understand?

33:40.300 --> 33:43.200
Look, it's too much dead air,
too much dead time!

33:43.266 --> 33:44.200
I can't do it!

33:44.266 --> 33:45.400
- There's nothing
I can do.

33:45.467 --> 33:46.934
- You fuck.

33:47.000 --> 33:49.433
You fuck.

33:49.500 --> 33:51.767
You fucking liar!

33:51.834 --> 33:53.500
You fucking
lied to me!

33:53.567 --> 33:55.100
- Settle down there,
White.

33:55.166 --> 33:56.133
- You fucking
settle down!

33:59.133 --> 34:00.700
You motherfucking liar!

34:00.767 --> 34:03.300
You fucking
lied to me!

34:03.367 --> 34:06.333
You fucking, motherfucking,
cocksucking liar!

34:06.400 --> 34:08.500
You lied to me!

34:08.567 --> 34:11.900
Everybody's always
fucking lying to me!

34:12.967 --> 34:14.266
I was going
so good now.

34:14.333 --> 34:17.333
You said you wouldn't
never give up on me.

34:17.400 --> 34:19.166
I don't want
to go back!

34:19.233 --> 34:21.633
Let me go!

34:21.700 --> 34:23.233
Oh!

34:23.300 --> 34:25.300
Good night!

34:30.367 --> 34:32.133
- Okay, you're
all done, Tim.

34:32.200 --> 34:33.367
You should go home.

34:33.433 --> 34:34.767
- I'll drive you.

34:34.834 --> 34:38.300
- Oh, you know,
White was right.

34:38.367 --> 34:41.200
I didn't fight you
hard enough.

34:41.266 --> 34:43.033
I wanted to
lose the argument.

34:43.100 --> 34:44.300
I wanted him
in solitary.

34:44.367 --> 34:45.567
- I could tell.

34:45.633 --> 34:46.934
- How?

34:47.000 --> 34:48.200
- You didn't stomp
out of my office

34:48.266 --> 34:49.600
when I wouldn't let you
have your way.

34:49.667 --> 34:51.800
- I do want him
in Em City.

34:51.867 --> 34:53.233
- He already stabbed you,

34:53.300 --> 34:54.967
and now he literally
kicked the shit out of you.

34:55.033 --> 34:57.767
- I don't care,
let him keep kicking.

34:57.834 --> 35:01.266
I lost that basketball game
because I gave up hope.

35:01.333 --> 35:05.166
I won't abandon
Omar White, I won't.

35:05.233 --> 35:06.667
- You stay home
a few days,

35:06.734 --> 35:09.500
and we'll talk after
you've had a chance to think.

35:09.567 --> 35:11.934
- Okay, but I'm not gonna
change my mind, Leo,

35:12.000 --> 35:15.333
because if I give up on
even one of these guys,

35:15.400 --> 35:18.433
might as well just
open up a diner somewhere,

35:18.500 --> 35:19.967
flip burgers till I die.

35:20.033 --> 35:21.633
- You know what?

35:21.700 --> 35:24.433
I may join you.

35:28.667 --> 35:31.500
- In 1955, James Dean
said to a friend,

35:31.567 --> 35:33.467
"My fun days are over."

35:33.533 --> 35:36.700
An hour later, his car
crashed and he was dead.

35:36.767 --> 35:38.667
A self-fulfilling prophecy...

35:38.734 --> 35:40.734
Or just bad luck?

35:59.300 --> 36:00.734
- Hey, how'd that go?

36:00.800 --> 36:02.600
- I gave the blood.

36:02.667 --> 36:03.934
They're taking a sample
out of the baby.

36:04.000 --> 36:06.133
If the two match,
she's my granddaughter.

36:06.200 --> 36:07.700
- While you were gone,

36:07.767 --> 36:08.700
I heard something
about Beecher.

36:08.767 --> 36:10.800
- What about Beecher?

36:10.867 --> 36:12.934
- Did you know
he's up for parole?

36:14.767 --> 36:16.200
- No.

36:16.266 --> 36:18.166
- His hearing is scheduled
for sometime this week.

36:18.233 --> 36:19.800
- Jesus.

36:19.867 --> 36:23.467
- Rumor is cocksucker's got
a good chance of getting out.

36:24.400 --> 36:25.800
- Give me that stick.

36:25.867 --> 36:27.266
What are we, solids?

36:27.333 --> 36:30.667
- Vern, Beecher
fucked up your parole.

36:30.734 --> 36:32.333
- Yeah, don't you think
I fucking remember that?

36:32.400 --> 36:34.533
- If you'd been paroled,
maybe your sons would be alive

36:34.600 --> 36:35.533
and your granddaughter--

36:35.600 --> 36:37.367
- Shut the fuck up!

36:45.100 --> 36:46.300
- Why didn't you
tell me?

36:46.367 --> 36:47.867
- Vern...

36:47.934 --> 36:49.600
- Why didn't you fucking mention
that you're up for parole?

36:49.667 --> 36:51.500
- This is not the way
to start an interaction.

36:51.567 --> 36:52.834
- Stay out of
this, lady!

36:52.900 --> 36:54.900
We're supposed to be
totally honest here!

36:54.967 --> 36:55.967
- Officer!

36:56.033 --> 36:57.000
- On equal,
goddamn footing!

36:57.066 --> 36:58.367
- Session's over.

36:58.433 --> 36:59.734
- All this time, you knew
you might be getting out.

36:59.800 --> 37:00.734
- All right, Schillinjer.

37:00.800 --> 37:01.967
- Schillinger!

37:02.033 --> 37:04.767
God damn it,
Schillinger!

37:04.834 --> 37:06.300
I've been here
nine fucking years,

37:06.367 --> 37:08.700
you'd think you'd learn
how to say my goddamn name!

37:17.400 --> 37:19.200
- Oh, great.

37:19.266 --> 37:21.166
He's gonna do something
to mess up my parole.

37:21.233 --> 37:22.800
- No, no, no,
I will talk to him.

37:22.867 --> 37:23.867
- It won't
do any good.

37:23.934 --> 37:25.834
- Tobias,
I'll talk to him.

37:25.900 --> 37:27.300
- I'm fucked.

37:31.967 --> 37:33.300
- Hey, buddy.

37:33.367 --> 37:35.200
- Hey, mind if
we chow down with you?

37:37.467 --> 37:39.500
- You gonna
eat that orange?

37:39.567 --> 37:41.567
- How about
this milk, huh?

37:44.467 --> 37:46.834
- I'm sorry I didn't
tell you about the parole.

37:46.900 --> 37:50.567
The truth is I don't really
believe it's going to happen.

37:50.633 --> 37:51.867
- Oh, it'll happen.

37:51.934 --> 37:53.433
Those cocksuckers
on the board

37:53.500 --> 37:56.567
see a rich boy like you
sobbing his story,

37:56.633 --> 37:58.834
their little hearts
will melt.

37:58.900 --> 38:00.433
You're not
going free, bitch.

38:00.500 --> 38:03.333
You're not walking out of here
and leaving me behind.

38:06.834 --> 38:08.233
Clean up this
fucking mess.

38:14.467 --> 38:15.633
- I spoke to
Schillinger.

38:15.700 --> 38:16.800
He said all
the right things.

38:16.867 --> 38:18.433
He apologized
for his outburst.

38:18.500 --> 38:21.000
He explained how important
the interaction sessions

38:21.066 --> 38:22.133
have been for him.

38:22.200 --> 38:24.100
- Yeah, well, he's lying.
- I know.

38:24.166 --> 38:25.500
- Can you put me in
protective custody?

38:25.567 --> 38:27.266
- Well, normally, I would,
but the unit's full.

38:27.333 --> 38:30.033
- Well, then put
Schillinger in solitary.

38:30.100 --> 38:31.433
- Well, he hasn't
done anything yet.

38:31.500 --> 38:33.166
And besides,
the unit's full.

38:33.233 --> 38:35.166
- Well, fuck,
lock down the prison!

38:35.233 --> 38:36.567
- Just for you, Beecher?

38:36.633 --> 38:37.633
Let's get serious, no.

38:37.700 --> 38:38.633
You'll stay in your pod.

38:38.700 --> 38:40.734
You'll get your meals there.

38:40.800 --> 38:43.467
I'll place an officer
outside your door.

38:43.533 --> 38:44.734
You'll be fine.

38:44.800 --> 38:47.800
- Why am I not overwhelmed
with relief?

38:54.533 --> 38:56.100
- Arif!

38:56.166 --> 38:58.633
Those bikers are
plotting something.

38:58.700 --> 38:59.967
- They want to
provoke Beecher

39:00.033 --> 39:01.266
into committing
an act of violence,

39:01.333 --> 39:03.000
end his chance
of parole.

39:03.066 --> 39:04.233
- Yeah.

39:04.300 --> 39:06.200
And I'm gonna
see that he doesn't.

39:06.266 --> 39:08.066
- And you're doing this
all for Beecher?

39:08.133 --> 39:09.433
- Oh, yeah...

39:09.500 --> 39:12.600
And for Salah Yudee,
and all those other lives

39:12.667 --> 39:14.834
the Aryans have
already destroyed.

39:21.834 --> 39:24.000
- Hoyt said he can't get
anywhere near Beecher.

39:24.066 --> 39:25.667
- Oh, fuck!

39:26.900 --> 39:28.066
When's the hearing?

39:28.133 --> 39:29.667
- Tomorrow, 11:00.

39:29.734 --> 39:30.867
- Shit.

39:30.934 --> 39:33.400
- Well, well, well,
well, well,

39:33.467 --> 39:37.567
if it isn't my old friend,
James Robson.

39:38.533 --> 39:39.934
- Said, I promised
the warden

39:40.000 --> 39:41.867
there wouldn't be
any trouble between us.

39:46.467 --> 39:47.533
Officer...

39:47.600 --> 39:51.066
You better
stay nearby.

39:51.133 --> 39:53.033
There might
be a hoedown.

40:04.400 --> 40:06.333
- Can I see Beecher?

40:16.700 --> 40:18.533
How you holding up?

40:18.600 --> 40:20.667
- Just gotta make it
through one more night.

40:20.734 --> 40:23.000
- I've just been very
clear with Schillinger.

40:23.066 --> 40:24.900
Any harm comes to you,

40:24.967 --> 40:27.033
and he will feel
the full wrath of Allah.

40:27.100 --> 40:30.633
- I appreciate that,
Kareem.

40:33.266 --> 40:35.633
- As-salaam alaikum,
my brother.

40:40.934 --> 40:43.000
- Peace be unto you too.
- Yeah.

40:44.600 --> 40:46.300
- Though from
what I can see,

40:46.367 --> 40:48.600
you're not in a very
peaceful place, huh?

40:48.667 --> 40:50.734
- I struggle...

40:50.800 --> 40:53.800
Same as you.

40:53.867 --> 40:55.767
- You know...

40:56.533 --> 40:58.800
When I was
all screwy about

40:58.867 --> 41:00.367
my hand in
Andrew Schillinger's death,

41:00.433 --> 41:02.000
you told me...

41:02.066 --> 41:05.867
To embrace my guilt or it would
eat away at me forever.

41:05.934 --> 41:07.400
- Mm-hmm.

41:07.467 --> 41:09.333
- It's funny that you haven't
taken your own advice

41:09.400 --> 41:11.233
regarding Adebisi.

41:11.300 --> 41:14.734
- How many times I gotta
tell you, Tobias?

41:14.800 --> 41:17.166
I feel no guilt
for killing Adebisi.

41:17.233 --> 41:19.200
- What haunts you is
not Adebisi's death,

41:19.266 --> 41:20.200
but his life.

41:20.266 --> 41:21.233
His life force.

41:21.300 --> 41:22.900
- Haunts me?

41:22.967 --> 41:25.700
What are you
talking about?

41:25.767 --> 41:27.767
- I saw your face the moment
after you killed him,

41:27.834 --> 41:30.734
and a bit of Adebisi
had bled into you...

41:30.800 --> 41:32.533
His anger,
his violence...

41:32.600 --> 41:35.166
- No, you're wrong!

41:35.233 --> 41:37.266
- Your entire life
you've kept tight control

41:37.333 --> 41:38.834
over your feelings.

41:38.900 --> 41:41.467
You denied the Adebisi in you,
but you can't do it any longer.

41:41.533 --> 41:44.500
You gotta make him
part of you, Kareem.

41:44.567 --> 41:47.166
Make him
a part of you.

42:06.033 --> 42:08.266
They're not gonna
take my sweaty palms

42:08.333 --> 42:10.567
as a sign of criminal intent,
are they?

42:10.633 --> 42:13.133
- Come on,
will you relax?

42:13.200 --> 42:16.200
I've been doing these kinds
of cases for six years now.

42:16.266 --> 42:19.934
I have never been more sure
of an outcome in my life.

42:20.000 --> 42:21.233
- Yeah, well, you've never
had Tobias Beecher

42:21.300 --> 42:23.233
as a client before.

42:27.233 --> 42:29.300
I got you a present.

42:33.300 --> 42:36.233
I didn't have
a chance to wrap it.

42:39.533 --> 42:41.834
- An appointment book.

42:41.900 --> 42:43.467
- Yeah.

42:43.533 --> 42:46.633
- Mr. Beecher,
we're ready for you.

42:46.700 --> 42:47.734
- Okay.

42:47.800 --> 42:52.333
Well, wish me luck.

42:52.400 --> 42:53.667
- I'll do more
than that.

42:55.333 --> 42:57.967
I'll do something
completely unprofessional.

43:04.066 --> 43:05.500
- Mr. Beecher!

43:07.266 --> 43:10.367
- Yeah, I'm coming.

43:11.567 --> 43:12.600
- Go.

43:22.233 --> 43:25.600
And then they asked me about
defecating on Schillinger's face

43:25.667 --> 43:28.900
and biting off
the tip of Robson's penis.

43:28.967 --> 43:32.867
I'm not sure my answers
really satisfied them.

43:40.033 --> 43:41.567
- They voted yes.

43:43.467 --> 43:44.800
- Oh, my God.

43:44.867 --> 43:48.100
Oh, my--
oh, my God.

43:48.166 --> 43:49.767
- Tobias?

43:49.834 --> 43:52.567
- I'm going home.

43:54.333 --> 43:56.967
Un-fucking-believable!

43:57.033 --> 43:58.100
- Oh!

44:19.800 --> 44:21.800
- Fuck me,
fucking cocksucker!

44:21.867 --> 44:23.834
- All right, man,
good for you.

44:23.900 --> 44:25.133
- Shut the fuck up.

44:35.633 --> 44:37.767
- Beecher's going free.

44:37.834 --> 44:39.200
- No.

44:39.266 --> 44:42.000
No, I want him dead.

44:42.066 --> 44:43.367
You understand?

44:43.433 --> 44:45.500
Beecher does not
leave Oz alive.

44:49.734 --> 44:51.600
- Mail!

44:51.667 --> 44:53.600
Let's go,
line it up!

45:06.600 --> 45:07.867
- Here's a letter
for Beecher.

45:07.934 --> 45:09.734
- I'll give it to him.

45:12.333 --> 45:14.100
- Hey, hey, hey,
hey, hey!

45:14.166 --> 45:16.000
You motherfucker!

45:16.066 --> 45:19.166
- You motherfucker!

45:38.133 --> 45:40.066
- Louisa, please make sure
you hold his hands down.

45:40.133 --> 45:41.400
- Okay.

45:56.233 --> 45:57.533
- I'm gonna miss you.

45:57.600 --> 45:58.800
- Don't.

45:58.867 --> 46:01.166
Try not to even
think of this place.

46:01.233 --> 46:02.600
- Well, that'll be hard.

46:02.667 --> 46:05.000
I still have a swastika
tattooed to my butt.

46:05.066 --> 46:08.166
- Be strong.

46:08.233 --> 46:11.867
Love your daughter.

46:11.934 --> 46:13.734
Love yourself.

47:09.567 --> 47:14.433
- So, do you think you can do
what Sister Peter Marie said,

47:14.500 --> 47:15.934
not think of Oz?

47:16.000 --> 47:17.700
- Yeah.

47:17.767 --> 47:22.400
Prisoner 97B412 is dead.

47:22.467 --> 47:24.500
I'm leaving
all his shit behind.

48:41.300 --> 48:44.934
And then they asked me about
defecating on Schillinger's face

48:45.000 --> 48:48.333
and biting off
the tip of Robson's penis.

48:48.400 --> 48:51.033
I'm not sure my answers
really satisfied them.

48:59.200 --> 49:00.400
Well?

49:01.066 --> 49:03.200
- I'm sorry, Tobias,
they voted no.

49:04.834 --> 49:06.834
They were impressed
by the progress

49:06.900 --> 49:09.467
you made over
the past few months,

49:09.533 --> 49:10.633
but didn't
feel it valid,

49:10.700 --> 49:12.700
saw the bad behavior
from before.

49:15.600 --> 49:18.700
- Fuck.
Fucking Christ.

49:18.767 --> 49:23.266
- I am so sorry that I painted
such a rosy outcome.

49:23.333 --> 49:25.500
I'm completely
and utterly in shock.

49:25.567 --> 49:27.533
- I'm sure you did
the very best you could.

49:27.600 --> 49:28.834
- They did say that they'd be
open

49:28.900 --> 49:30.700
to another hearing
in a year.

49:30.767 --> 49:31.800
- A year?

49:33.133 --> 49:35.233
Another year?

49:37.100 --> 49:38.934
Fucking Oz.

49:39.000 --> 49:40.166
- Tobias.

49:40.233 --> 49:41.700
- Take me to my cell.

49:41.767 --> 49:43.867
- Tobias, stay here
and talk for a minute.

49:43.934 --> 49:46.300
- Later, I want
to be alone.

50:35.066 --> 50:37.734
- Beecher.

50:37.800 --> 50:40.567
I'm so glad that you and I
get to interact some more.

50:40.633 --> 50:43.967
-  Get the fuck
away from me.

50:44.033 --> 50:48.100
- Now, now,
don't be bitter.

50:48.166 --> 50:49.767
- Let's kiss
and make up, huh?

50:53.834 --> 50:55.533
I warned you.

51:05.633 --> 51:07.000
- Fuck!

51:09.066 --> 51:10.867
- Adebisi lives!

51:17.567 --> 51:19.600
Adebisi lives!

51:22.300 --> 51:24.066
- Okay, Vern, I need you
to move your foot.

51:24.133 --> 51:25.367
Can you move
your feet?

51:25.433 --> 51:26.533
Start an IV
right now.

51:26.600 --> 51:28.834
I need some more
4 by 4's.

51:28.900 --> 51:30.700
Right now, okay, you need to
move your hand.

51:30.767 --> 51:32.667
Move your hand!
- Fuck!

52:10.433 --> 52:14.266
Hill: I want to go back to
my old home before I die.

52:14.333 --> 52:17.200
I asked the great white father
to allow me to go back,

52:17.266 --> 52:19.767
but he said no.

52:19.834 --> 52:21.734
Geronimo.

52:37.967 --> 52:39.734
- Didn't I tell
y'all motherfuckers?

52:39.800 --> 52:42.066
Cable is the best!

52:42.133 --> 52:44.433
- O'Reily?

52:44.500 --> 52:46.600
O'Reily!

52:46.667 --> 52:47.700
- What?

52:47.767 --> 52:49.667
- Package.

52:57.166 --> 52:58.734
- That's the wristwatch?

52:58.800 --> 52:59.867
- Yeah.

52:59.934 --> 53:01.834
- Last piece we need
for the bomb.

53:01.900 --> 53:03.133
- We're gonna detonate it
during rec hour?

53:03.200 --> 53:04.767
- The best time.

53:04.834 --> 53:08.467
The gymnasium won't take the
blast being so far from Em City.

53:12.734 --> 53:14.633
- Are you sure
about this?

53:15.900 --> 53:19.734
- The U.S. government
made me a prisoner of war.

53:19.800 --> 53:23.166
I'm being sent back to England
for purely political reasons,

53:23.233 --> 53:25.100
and that's wrong.

53:25.166 --> 53:27.967
So we have to act.

53:28.033 --> 53:29.633
Will our single deed
create change?

53:29.700 --> 53:32.000
Maybe...

53:32.066 --> 53:34.300
Probably not.

53:35.033 --> 53:37.800
- So, then you're saying it's
not the battle, but the war?

53:37.867 --> 53:41.934
- I'm saying whether we ever win
the war is for God to decide.

53:42.000 --> 53:44.767
For man,
there's only fighting.

53:44.834 --> 53:46.200
- Fight for
fighting's sake.

53:46.266 --> 53:47.400
That's fucked up, man.

53:47.467 --> 53:48.967
- No...

53:49.033 --> 53:52.467
Fighting because injustice
must always be met head on.

53:52.533 --> 53:55.667
Live like that.

53:55.734 --> 53:59.533
We may not win,
but we ensure

53:59.600 --> 54:02.900
we never, ever lose.

54:08.333 --> 54:11.400
- Ryan!
- Hi, kid.

54:11.467 --> 54:13.233
Feel all right?

54:25.900 --> 54:26.934
Hey.

54:27.967 --> 54:30.633
I can't thank you enough for
getting Cyril sent back to me.

54:30.700 --> 54:32.834
- I didn't transfer
him for you, Ryan.

54:32.900 --> 54:34.600
I did it 'cause
it's the right thing to do.

54:34.667 --> 54:36.600
- No, I know that,
you know.

54:36.667 --> 54:38.133
Because you always
do the right thing,

54:38.200 --> 54:39.500
the moral thing.

54:39.567 --> 54:40.934
That's why I love you.

54:41.000 --> 54:42.667
Kiss me.

54:46.133 --> 54:47.567
- Officer!

54:49.800 --> 54:52.633
Take O'Reily
back to Em City.

54:53.333 --> 54:55.367
- I didn't mean
to upset you, you know.

54:55.433 --> 54:58.500
All I meant to say was I got
every reason to live now,

54:58.567 --> 55:00.266
every reason.

55:16.333 --> 55:18.166
Hey, we gotta talk.

55:18.233 --> 55:21.133
Look, we gotta
call this operation off.

55:21.200 --> 55:22.900
- For fuck's sake,
keep your voice down.

55:22.967 --> 55:24.066
We'll discuss
this later.

55:24.133 --> 55:25.433
- No, later's
gonna be too late.

55:25.500 --> 55:26.900
We're gonna end up
killing a lot of people

55:26.967 --> 55:27.967
that shouldn't
have to die.

55:28.033 --> 55:29.500
- We've been
through this.

55:29.567 --> 55:31.667
Em City will
be nearly empty.

55:31.734 --> 55:33.266
I'll get word
to the C.O.s.

55:33.333 --> 55:36.033
They'll have five minutes
for further evacuation.

55:36.100 --> 55:38.567
- No, what if the hacks
don't act fast enough?

55:38.633 --> 55:39.934
- I can't control that.

55:40.000 --> 55:42.133
- What if the blast
spreads to other areas,

55:42.200 --> 55:44.000
other cell blocks,
maybe even the hospital,

55:44.066 --> 55:45.200
the visiting rooms?

55:45.266 --> 55:47.400
- There's nothing
else can be done.

55:47.467 --> 55:48.667
- No, look.

55:50.166 --> 55:52.400
I've killed anybody
for just about anything.

55:52.467 --> 55:54.967
So, I'm not gonna try to get
all high and mighty on you.

55:55.033 --> 55:58.200
I know that this mission
makes sense to you.

55:58.266 --> 56:00.800
But for me, I see
what we're about to do,

56:00.867 --> 56:04.667
and for the first time in
my miserable, fucking life,

56:04.734 --> 56:07.300
I feel like
I finally understand.

56:07.367 --> 56:09.200
- Understand?
Understand what?

56:09.266 --> 56:11.967
- Our actions,
they make us who we are.

56:12.033 --> 56:13.333
And up to now

56:13.400 --> 56:16.200
my actions don't amount
to a pile of shit.

56:16.266 --> 56:17.700
Hey, Jesus Christ,
Padraig,

56:17.767 --> 56:19.233
I've got a brother

56:19.300 --> 56:22.934
and even a woman inside
these walls who believe in me.

56:23.000 --> 56:26.166
They believed in me when I gave
them nothing to believe in.

56:26.233 --> 56:28.567
- One hour from now,

56:28.633 --> 56:31.367
we're gonna
complete our mission.

56:31.433 --> 56:33.233
- Fuck you!

56:33.300 --> 56:34.567
- What are you doing?

56:34.633 --> 56:36.433
- Look, I've always been
the guy who walked tall,

56:36.500 --> 56:37.767
held his head high.

56:37.834 --> 56:39.867
But that's always
just been a move for show.

56:39.934 --> 56:43.900
For once, I'm gonna earn
the right to walk that way.

56:48.333 --> 56:49.567
Hey, excuse me.

56:49.633 --> 56:50.867
I need to go
back to Em City.

56:50.934 --> 56:52.734
I got an emergency.

56:52.800 --> 56:54.700
- O'Reily, what the fuck
is wrong with you?

56:54.767 --> 56:56.800
You left the fucking
gas on again.

56:56.867 --> 56:57.934
- Well, turn it off!

56:58.000 --> 56:59.467
- No, you turn it off,
where you going?

56:59.533 --> 57:02.166
Hey, I ain't gonna do
your fucking job for you.

57:19.500 --> 57:22.233
- Uh-huh, no, I'm taking this
fucking bomb to the hacks.

57:22.300 --> 57:23.266
- Relax, Ryan.

57:23.333 --> 57:24.433
It took me
a minute,

57:24.500 --> 57:25.900
but what you said
in the cafeteria

57:25.967 --> 57:28.133
is starting to penetrate
this thick skull of mine.

57:28.200 --> 57:30.500
- Yeah?

57:30.567 --> 57:32.567
Jesus, look,
that's good, Padraig,

57:32.633 --> 57:34.967
because, you know, we could
still fight the good fight.

57:35.033 --> 57:36.033
We just gotta figure out a
different way

57:36.100 --> 57:37.066
to do it, all right?

57:37.133 --> 57:38.700
- Be careful.

57:38.767 --> 57:40.033
Did you shut off
the time delay?

57:40.100 --> 57:41.400
- I haven't
done anything.

57:41.467 --> 57:43.233
- Give me it.

57:48.834 --> 57:50.633
- Whoa, hey!
What are you doing?

57:50.700 --> 57:51.734
- What must be done.

57:51.800 --> 57:52.967
You've two minutes.

57:53.033 --> 57:54.000
- No, Padraig!

57:54.066 --> 57:55.333
Fuck!

57:56.767 --> 57:57.767
Cyril, beat it!

57:57.834 --> 57:59.500
McManus!

57:59.567 --> 58:01.533
McManus, Murphy,
he's got a bomb!

58:01.600 --> 58:02.800
- Huh?

58:02.867 --> 58:04.533
- Down there,
Connelly's got a bomb!

58:07.367 --> 58:08.633
- He's got a bomb!

58:08.700 --> 58:11.033
Fucking Connelly's
got a bomb!

58:13.333 --> 58:15.333
- You've got exactly
one minute, 30 seconds

58:15.400 --> 58:17.533
to evacuate Em City!

58:28.300 --> 58:29.667
- Padraig,
put the bomb down.

58:29.734 --> 58:31.200
Put it down,
let's talk.

58:31.266 --> 58:32.734
- One minute, 15.

58:32.800 --> 58:33.800
- Fuck!

58:33.867 --> 58:36.233
You, you,
check the computer room.

58:36.300 --> 58:38.767
You three, make sure
every fucking pod is empty!

58:38.834 --> 58:40.233
- Open the gate.

58:45.734 --> 58:46.934
- Hey, Padraig,
Padraig...

58:47.000 --> 58:48.400
Cut those wires.

58:48.467 --> 58:51.266
- There's no turning back,
less than a minute.

58:51.333 --> 58:52.567
You should go.

58:52.633 --> 58:54.533
- No, just put it down
and we'll both go.

58:54.600 --> 58:57.667
- A foreign army still
occupies Irish streets.

58:57.734 --> 58:59.767
- That's all the more reason for
you to stay alive, remember?

58:59.834 --> 59:01.266
To fight, remember?

59:01.333 --> 59:03.633
- I've no illusions about
what I face back in England.

59:03.700 --> 59:05.834
I'll not die
on their soil.

59:05.900 --> 59:07.533
I end here.

59:07.600 --> 59:08.834
- O'Reily, come on,
let's go!

59:08.900 --> 59:10.700
- 20 seconds!
- Ryan!

59:10.767 --> 59:12.066
- Goddamn you, Padraig!

59:20.934 --> 59:22.333
- Ten seconds!

59:23.567 --> 59:25.667
Hail Mary, full of grace,
the Lord is with thee.

59:25.734 --> 59:26.967
Blessed art thou
amongst women,

59:27.033 --> 59:28.633
and blessed is the fruit
of thy womb, Jesus.

59:28.700 --> 59:30.200
Holy Mary,
mother of god,

59:30.266 --> 59:32.667
pray for us sinners now
and at the hour of our death.

59:32.734 --> 59:33.800
Amen.

59:43.900 --> 59:46.033
Oh, Christ Almighty.

1:00:06.734 --> 1:00:08.133
- How soon till
detonation?

1:00:08.200 --> 1:00:10.066
- It should have
gone off by now.

1:00:10.133 --> 1:00:13.967
- Fucking piece of shite!

1:00:18.133 --> 1:00:19.500
- It's a dud.

1:00:19.567 --> 1:00:20.967
It's a fucking dud.

1:00:21.033 --> 1:00:23.300
- Go get him.

1:00:38.100 --> 1:00:39.433
- Maybe what we say
when we go

1:00:39.500 --> 1:00:42.100
is less important than
what's said about us.

1:00:42.166 --> 1:00:43.633
When you die,

1:00:43.700 --> 1:00:46.367
what's the nicest thing
someone will utter about you?

1:00:46.433 --> 1:00:48.000
What's the worst?

1:00:48.066 --> 1:00:50.567
Somewhere in between
is who you are.

1:00:50.633 --> 1:00:55.066
Or maybe mere words aren't
enough to define a life.

1:00:55.133 --> 1:00:58.900
Maybe only
one's actions can.
