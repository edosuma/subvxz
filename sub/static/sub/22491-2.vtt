00:18.852 --> 00:20.683
It's alive!

00:39.039 --> 00:42.099
¤ This is how I dance
when I'm not wearing underpants ¤

00:42.142 --> 00:45.600
¤ Nothing I like more than to dance,
and I'm not gonna wear no pants ¤

00:45.645 --> 00:47.010
¤ You can't make me... ¤

00:52.719 --> 00:54.186
J. K. Rowling.

00:54.220 --> 00:58.020
- Cor blimey, are you an angel?
- I am from the future.

00:58.058 --> 01:01.892
In 15 years' time you will be
a best-selling children's book author...

01:01.928 --> 01:05.125
whose net worth is more
than one billion American dollars.

01:05.165 --> 01:07.360
I had an idea about a boy wizard.

01:07.400 --> 01:11.097
No. Your books will be
about a magical raccoon.

01:11.137 --> 01:13.230
He has an afro,
his name is Squiggles...

01:13.273 --> 01:15.605
and he shoots pixie dust
out of his bunghole.

01:15.642 --> 01:18.611
Thank you.
I'll start right away.

01:21.648 --> 01:24.276
OK, little girl,
pick any pet you'd like.

01:24.317 --> 01:25.614
Thanks.

01:26.719 --> 01:29.187
What are you doing in here,
Mr. Kitty Cat?

01:29.255 --> 01:32.782
A space time vortex opened up
on my home planet, Thundera...

01:32.826 --> 01:34.691
and I suddenly found myself on Earth...

01:34.727 --> 01:37.696
where cats apparently
don't share the same rights as humans.

01:37.730 --> 01:39.960
You're so cute! I choose you.

01:39.999 --> 01:42.263
I can't wait for show and tell.

01:42.302 --> 01:44.600
¤ Vicky has cooties,
Vicky has cooties ¤

01:44.637 --> 01:46.400
Stop it, Billy.

01:46.439 --> 01:49.897
Vicky does not have cooties.

01:49.943 --> 01:52.104
Anyone else? Anyone else?

01:52.145 --> 01:54.807
Come on, I got nine lives
and a whole can of whoo-pass.

01:54.848 --> 01:57.214
Bad! Bad Mr. Kitty Cat!

01:57.250 --> 02:01.152
Fine, fine. I overreacted.
Sorry, everybody.

02:01.187 --> 02:03.382
Sorry, that one's on me.

02:04.424 --> 02:06.358
Please stop that.

02:06.392 --> 02:07.791
This is my new pet.

02:07.827 --> 02:10.990
His name is Mr. Kitty Cat,
and I got him at the pound.

02:11.030 --> 02:15.126
Actually, my name is Lion-o,
leader of the Thundercats.

02:15.168 --> 02:17.363
- I'm the chosen one.
- Lame.

02:20.340 --> 02:24.003
Come on, Vicky!
Aren't we still friends?

02:24.043 --> 02:26.034
- B-F-F.
- No.

02:27.080 --> 02:29.310
- Vicky!
- Go to hell!

02:29.349 --> 02:32.182
Don't worry, Lion-o.
We'll find you a home.

02:33.186 --> 02:36.553
Miss Prissy Pants,
stop fussing with your bow.

02:36.589 --> 02:39.581
This bow sucks!
And my name is Lion-o...

02:39.626 --> 02:42.390
Leader of the Thundercats,
sworn to...

02:42.428 --> 02:45.864
Oopsie,
grouchy kitties don't get any tuna.

02:46.866 --> 02:48.925
I better get some frickin' tuna.

02:48.968 --> 02:51.732
- Yes?
- Because your wife was a bitch?

02:51.771 --> 02:56.140
Because she was a bitch. Yes.

02:56.176 --> 02:58.974
There you go.
One shaved head.

02:59.012 --> 03:01.742
Great! Let's make the carpet
match the drapes.

03:01.781 --> 03:03.749
Margaret. Sarah.

03:03.783 --> 03:06.149
A pony! A pony! Yay, a pony!

03:06.186 --> 03:09.451
Only one of you gets the pony.
The other one gets a whipping.

03:09.489 --> 03:11.650
Now let's see those report cards.

03:11.691 --> 03:14.455
The British are coming!
The British are coming!

03:14.494 --> 03:15.859
A shortcut.

03:21.267 --> 03:24.134
Here, Clifford! Here, boy!

03:29.742 --> 03:30.834
No, Clifford, no!

03:32.245 --> 03:35.078
Bad dog, Clifford!
Bad dog!

03:38.952 --> 03:40.510
Clifford.

03:40.553 --> 03:43.351
You know I've never done
a neutering before?

03:43.389 --> 03:45.050
Just do your best.

03:45.091 --> 03:48.288
Now live from
the Shady Acres Nursing Home...

03:48.328 --> 03:51.923
the legendary
Evel Knievel's greatest stunt ever...

03:51.965 --> 03:54.729
only on Pay-Per-View.

04:14.954 --> 04:16.683
It's Moses! He's back.

04:16.723 --> 04:18.053
God has blessed me...

04:18.091 --> 04:20.992
with ten irrefutable
Commandments for living.

04:21.027 --> 04:24.258
Is there anything on there about
not pushing your religion on other people?

04:24.297 --> 04:26.288
- No.
- Didn't think so.

04:26.332 --> 04:28.095
Number one.

04:28.134 --> 04:30.898
He who smelt it, dealt it.

04:30.937 --> 04:32.768
What's so funny?

04:32.805 --> 04:34.932
Stop it. Stop laughing.

04:41.881 --> 04:43.473
Hey, Björk, Björk.

04:47.053 --> 04:48.452
Hey, Mork. Nanoo.

04:50.523 --> 04:52.684
Hey, dork.

04:52.725 --> 04:53.714
New York.

04:56.663 --> 04:57.857
Quark!

05:00.333 --> 05:02.233
Tour?

05:02.969 --> 05:05.028
Zork.

05:07.940 --> 05:08.964
Pork.

05:11.511 --> 05:13.877
A fork? Where the fork?
Need a fork.

05:15.415 --> 05:17.906
There a spork. Spork, spork.

05:19.686 --> 05:21.449
There the Orc!

05:21.487 --> 05:22.715
Orc!

05:23.956 --> 05:26.288
What kept you, honey?
Dinner's waiting.

05:26.326 --> 05:28.157
Get the hell off my back, woman!

05:28.194 --> 05:30.185
Can I get a moment of fucking peace?

05:32.332 --> 05:36.200
Yeah. Now just like that.
Now spank me and call me daddy.

05:37.303 --> 05:39.430
- Mein Kampf!
- Sieg heil!

05:52.852 --> 05:55.047
Achtung! Achtung!

05:55.088 --> 05:56.350
Hello?

06:00.360 --> 06:01.588
Douche.

06:02.862 --> 06:06.093
I walked into a door.

06:06.132 --> 06:09.898
Well, then, can I interest you
in our line of Nerf doors?

06:09.936 --> 06:13.030
What about stairs?
She's gonna need some Nerf stairs, too.

06:19.078 --> 06:22.070
Good morning. What are
we gonna do today, Corey Feldman?

06:22.115 --> 06:24.208
Same thing we do every day, Corey Haim.

06:24.250 --> 06:25.979
We save the world.

06:39.966 --> 06:43.333
Let's go start the day. Yeah!

06:45.538 --> 06:46.732
This just in.

06:46.773 --> 06:49.071
President Bush's daughters
are missing in action...

06:49.108 --> 06:51.599
after the helicopter carrying them
to a USO tour event...

06:51.644 --> 06:53.305
crashed in the Brazilian rain forest.

06:53.346 --> 06:56.941
The military released the following
videotape just prior to the crash.

06:58.551 --> 07:00.314
It is a party!

07:02.054 --> 07:03.487
My dad's the President.

07:03.523 --> 07:07.186
Miss Bush, please!
I can't see! Look out!

07:08.194 --> 07:11.652
Two presidential daughters.
That's one for each of us.

07:11.697 --> 07:13.665
Feld-dog, let's roll.

07:22.041 --> 07:24.839
- Coordinates are locked in.
- Let's punch it.

07:27.180 --> 07:29.148
Let's go, go, go, go!

07:29.182 --> 07:31.810
This is tight!
This is tight!

07:31.851 --> 07:35.810
And that's what would it be like
if we had the Corey van and the Corey jet.

07:37.390 --> 07:39.824
Listen to me.
We should have Corey rocket packs.

07:39.859 --> 07:41.292
Corey, I got an idea for you.

07:41.327 --> 07:43.818
How about a nice, tall glass
of shut the fuck up?

07:48.668 --> 07:51.136
Barkeep.
Nice frosty cola right here.

07:51.170 --> 07:52.398
Two straws, please.

07:52.438 --> 07:55.430
- We don't serve your kind here.
- Our kind?

07:56.142 --> 07:57.769
You mean Americans?

07:57.810 --> 08:00.779
No, I mean anyone
who's ever been on the cover...

08:00.813 --> 08:05.773
of a teen magazine
like Buff, Tiger Beat...

08:05.818 --> 08:10.949
Teen Beat,
Cosmo Girl, J-14...

08:12.291 --> 08:15.317
Boy, did you guys pick
the wrong two Coreys.

08:15.361 --> 08:16.453
Guys. Listen.

08:16.496 --> 08:19.761
We don't want any trouble
and I don't think you do, either, so...

08:19.799 --> 08:22.233
To the contrary,
trouble is what you now have...

08:22.268 --> 08:24.293
because we are giving it to you.

08:24.337 --> 08:26.635
Orientation of Sexual...

08:26.672 --> 08:28.003
Wait! Wait.

08:29.709 --> 08:31.267
Just wait a second.

08:35.347 --> 08:37.509
Now we're gonna tear it up.

08:37.549 --> 08:39.017
Lost Boys style.

08:46.559 --> 08:47.651
My ear!

08:48.861 --> 08:49.850
That wasn't...

08:49.896 --> 08:51.193
Gotcha!

09:05.077 --> 09:07.102
Thanks for helping us, douche...

09:07.146 --> 09:08.170
Screech.

09:08.214 --> 09:10.580
The location
of the Bush daughters is here.

09:10.616 --> 09:13.983
And now I must return
to my Muay Thai kickbox training.

09:14.020 --> 09:15.385
Why would you help us?

09:15.421 --> 09:18.447
Because I, too, am a former teen idol.

09:18.491 --> 09:21.619
No. Actually, you were more
like a second third banana...

09:21.661 --> 09:24.459
on a B-rated kids' show,
but hey, whatever you say.

09:25.631 --> 09:27.258
What the hell is this place?

09:27.300 --> 09:29.666
Is this the place?
Could this be the place?

09:29.702 --> 09:31.533
I'm going in either way, so...

09:31.571 --> 09:33.471
Love shack, baby!

09:41.180 --> 09:43.740
- Presidential babes.
- We're here to rescue you.

09:43.783 --> 09:46.479
- Rescue us?
- You can go straight to hell!

09:46.519 --> 09:50.285
Yeah, we're finally free!
Free to party!

09:54.660 --> 09:56.389
We're never going home.

09:57.563 --> 10:00.532
Look, Feld-dog, if we can't bring
them home, we can't be heroes.

10:00.566 --> 10:05.003
Well, Haim, looks like we've got
to rely on our one true skill.

10:05.037 --> 10:08.473
You're not talking about the thing
we do with our taints, are you?

10:08.507 --> 10:10.168
No, Corey. Acting.

10:11.577 --> 10:14.410
Though Corey Haim and Corey Feldman
couldn't be here today...

10:14.447 --> 10:18.907
I want to thank them
for bringing my precious daughters home.

10:18.951 --> 10:21.943
I hereby declare
that anyone who hates the Coreys...

10:21.988 --> 10:23.080
also hates America.

10:23.122 --> 10:26.717
Feld-dog, what happens
if they find the real Bush twins, man?

10:26.759 --> 10:28.522
Fat chance.

10:28.561 --> 10:30.188
Dad?

10:30.229 --> 10:33.027
Damn you to hell,
Corey Haim and Corey Feldman.

10:33.065 --> 10:34.726
My dad's the President.

10:34.767 --> 10:37.759
I'm gonna get you buried in oil...

10:37.803 --> 10:41.204
and then I'm gonna have
my daddy invade you!

10:41.240 --> 10:42.798
My dad will get you hurt.

10:42.842 --> 10:46.300
Yeah, how'd you like to have
your ass kicked by Halli Burton...

10:46.345 --> 10:48.336
or Halliblurton?

10:48.381 --> 10:50.713
Think, Jenna,
we're like old apples...

10:50.750 --> 10:52.445
tied up to a bag of shit.

10:52.485 --> 10:53.782
It's dark.

10:53.819 --> 10:55.684
All right, all right.

10:55.721 --> 10:58.212
I got to go to the bathroom.

10:58.257 --> 10:59.656
Eat my air!

11:01.093 --> 11:02.082
Look at me go!
