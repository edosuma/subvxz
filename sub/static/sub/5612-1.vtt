Hello.
I'm your new commanding officer,

00:19.884 --> 00:21.351
Captain Seth Dozerman.

00:21.386 --> 00:24.621
Efficiency,
efficiency, efficiency.

00:24.656 --> 00:26.123
Could probably
just say it once.

00:26.157 --> 00:27.191
Are you making fun
of my stutter?

00:27.225 --> 00:28.525
Oh, uh...

00:28.560 --> 00:29.760
Tricked you.
I don't have a stutter.

00:29.761 --> 00:31.562
Boom, I've already
established my authority

00:31.563 --> 00:32.883
through my amazing
sense of humor.

00:32.897 --> 00:34.031
Well done, sir.

00:34.065 --> 00:36.033
Welcome to the Nine-Nine.

00:36.034 --> 00:37.434
I'm Sergeant Terry Jeffords.

00:37.469 --> 00:38.936
And I'm not interested.

00:38.937 --> 00:40.037
I have no use for people.

00:40.071 --> 00:42.005
I find people weird
and confusing.

00:42.006 --> 00:43.106
I live my life by numbers.

00:43.107 --> 00:44.274
You see this watch?

00:44.275 --> 00:46.543
It tells me how many calories
I burn at any time.

00:46.544 --> 00:48.145
How many calories
do you think I burned

00:48.146 --> 00:49.546
walking from there to there?

00:49.581 --> 00:50.714
You, female closest to me.

00:50.748 --> 00:53.817
Oh, uh, three?

00:53.852 --> 00:56.286
Three?
Ah-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!

00:56.321 --> 00:58.489
Try 0.8, numbnuts.

00:58.523 --> 01:00.224
I have made promises
to my superiors

01:00.225 --> 01:01.692
that I most certainly
cannot keep.

01:01.693 --> 01:04.861
That's why I need you idiots
to work twice as hard.

01:04.896 --> 01:06.830
No, no, strike that.
Four times as hard.

01:06.831 --> 01:08.031
No, no, no, strike that.

01:08.032 --> 01:11.168
I need you morons to work
eight times harder

01:11.169 --> 01:14.671
than you've ever worked
in your entire life!

01:14.672 --> 01:15.739
I'm having a heart attack.

01:15.773 --> 01:17.841
Yeah, I'm having
a heart attack.

01:17.842 --> 01:19.343
Get back to work.

Perfect cover.
Nailed it.

01:46.471 --> 01:49.173
So apparently,
the new captain survived,

01:49.174 --> 01:51.108
and his heart attack...
not the craziest thing

01:51.109 --> 01:53.510
that happened
at the precinct today.

01:53.545 --> 01:56.079
We kissed, like,
three hours ago.

01:56.114 --> 02:00.284
Yes, we did kiss
each other for reals.

02:00.318 --> 02:01.385
For reals, reals.

02:01.419 --> 02:02.753
Listen.

02:02.754 --> 02:04.421
I know you said you
don't want to date cops,

02:04.422 --> 02:06.924
but I really like you.

02:06.958 --> 02:08.792
I like you too.

02:08.827 --> 02:10.294
Good.

02:10.328 --> 02:11.595
But what if we start dating

02:11.596 --> 02:12.930
and it makes things
weird at work?

02:12.964 --> 02:16.066
So let's just keep it
light and breezy,

02:16.067 --> 02:17.134
see where it goes.

02:17.168 --> 02:18.669
Totally. Yeah.

02:18.670 --> 02:21.939
So how do we keep it
light and breezy?

02:21.940 --> 02:24.641
I know.
A comprehensive set of rules.

02:24.676 --> 02:25.742
How am I attracted to you?

02:25.743 --> 02:26.777
Doesn't matter.
I am. Go.

02:26.811 --> 02:28.612
Rule one,
let's not tell anyone

02:28.613 --> 02:30.380
so we can figure out
what this is first.

02:30.415 --> 02:31.448
Smort.
Rule number two,

02:31.449 --> 02:32.583
let's not put labels on it.

02:32.584 --> 02:33.750
We're not boyfriend
and girlfriend;

02:33.751 --> 02:36.286
We're just "mrmmzeep"
and "jinglebin."

02:36.321 --> 02:38.255
Great.
Rule number three,

02:38.256 --> 02:39.529
let's not have sex
right away.

02:40.759 --> 02:43.026
Cool, cool, cool,
cool, cool, cool...

02:43.027 --> 02:44.561
No doubt, no doubt,
no doubt, no doubt.

02:44.562 --> 02:45.996
Good rule.
No sex, good rule.

02:46.030 --> 02:48.799
So should we go out tonight?

02:48.800 --> 02:49.967
Yeah, totally.

02:50.001 --> 02:51.435
Maybe 8:00, maybe 9:00.
Doesn't matter.

02:51.436 --> 02:52.435
We're light and breezy.

02:52.437 --> 02:54.404
Totally light and breezy.

No!

Briefing room.

02:57.342 --> 02:59.710
Five minutes.

02:59.711 --> 03:01.678
Wow, very chill.

03:05.216 --> 03:06.216
Wuntch.

03:06.251 --> 03:08.619
Hello, Raymond.

03:08.620 --> 03:10.120
You're looking
old and sickly.

03:10.154 --> 03:12.022
So nice of you
to greet us, Madeline.

03:12.023 --> 03:14.224
I thought surely you'd still
be crushed under that house

03:14.225 --> 03:15.225
in Munchkinland.

03:15.260 --> 03:16.927
Sticks and stones, Raymond.

03:16.961 --> 03:18.428
Describing your breakfast?

03:18.463 --> 03:20.797
I came out as a gay cop
in the 1980s,

03:20.798 --> 03:22.800
so it's gonna take more
than reassigning me

03:22.801 --> 03:24.168
to break my spirit.

03:24.169 --> 03:26.770
I'll turn this place around
just like I did the Nine-Nine.

03:26.771 --> 03:28.305
I doubt that.

03:28.339 --> 03:31.542
Everyone, this is
your new commanding officer,

03:31.576 --> 03:32.809
Raymond Holt.

03:32.810 --> 03:34.645
He's going to be with you
for a long, long time.

03:34.646 --> 03:35.679
Thank you, Chief Wuntch.

03:35.713 --> 03:37.614
I'm excited to be back.

03:37.615 --> 03:39.349
I look forward
to doing meaningful work

03:39.350 --> 03:42.486
beginning with my eight-point
plan for community engagement.

03:42.487 --> 03:44.354
Wonderful.

03:44.355 --> 03:45.556
But no new initiatives

03:45.557 --> 03:47.024
until you finish
the meaningful work

03:47.025 --> 03:48.459
that's already
in progress here.

03:48.493 --> 03:49.693
Could be a while, Raymond.

03:49.727 --> 03:51.061
They're trying
to come up with a name

03:51.062 --> 03:53.430
for the NYPD's
new pigeon mascot.

03:54.766 --> 03:56.266
Oh, no.

03:56.267 --> 03:57.668
What?
Naming a pigeon?

03:57.669 --> 03:59.570
How long could
that possibly take?

03:59.604 --> 04:01.138
They've been at it
for months.

04:01.139 --> 04:03.474
I love my life.

04:05.009 --> 04:07.744
Holy Moses, he's alive.

04:07.745 --> 04:10.447
So I want to explain
what happened back there.

04:10.448 --> 04:11.608
I did not have
a heart attack.

04:11.616 --> 04:13.050
The doctors have informed me

04:13.084 --> 04:15.085
that I have a genetic
heart condition.

04:15.120 --> 04:18.922
My aortic valve
is 16% too narrow,

04:18.923 --> 04:23.260
which lowers my life
expectancy from 103 to 64.

04:23.294 --> 04:25.329
So sorry, sir.
That's terrible.

04:25.330 --> 04:26.930
Yes, it's depressing.

04:26.931 --> 04:28.799
They also informed me
that I carry the gene

04:28.800 --> 04:30.033
for webbed feet,

04:30.068 --> 04:32.669
which is interesting,
more than anything else.

04:32.670 --> 04:36.240
But, uh, when you stare
death in the face,

04:36.241 --> 04:39.409
as I have, it really puts
things into perspective,

04:39.444 --> 04:42.946
namely that I've been <i> wasting</i>
too much of my time

04:42.947 --> 04:44.414
farting around!

04:44.449 --> 04:46.250
<i>So that stops now!</i>

04:46.284 --> 04:48.685
Say good-bye
to the fun, hilarious,

04:48.686 --> 04:50.320
laid-back Seth Dozerman

04:50.321 --> 04:51.622
that you used to love.

04:51.623 --> 04:53.624
Boys, hand 'em out!

04:53.658 --> 04:55.159
What the hell are these?

04:55.193 --> 04:56.426
"What the hell
are these?"

04:56.427 --> 04:57.961
These are Dozer-pads.

04:57.996 --> 04:59.930
Each one is equipped
with a GPS system

04:59.931 --> 05:01.732
and a countdown clock
to remind you

05:01.733 --> 05:04.468
to complete a task
every 55 minutes.

05:04.469 --> 05:07.604
It also has backgammon on it,
which I could not delete

05:07.605 --> 05:09.239
but you are not
allowed to play.

05:09.274 --> 05:10.874
What happens when
the clock runs out?

05:12.077 --> 05:13.410
<i>Failure. Failure.</i>

05:13.411 --> 05:14.745
<i>You are behind schedule!</i>

05:14.779 --> 05:16.080
- Oh, that's fun.
- Yeah.

05:16.081 --> 05:19.183
Your 55 minutes
starts right...

05:19.184 --> 05:20.751
now.

05:22.687 --> 05:25.022
Sarge, I don't need
to be monitored all day long.

05:25.023 --> 05:26.523
I'm not a toddler.
This is stupid.

05:26.558 --> 05:27.958
I know you're not a toddler,

05:27.959 --> 05:30.828
because my toddlers know
that "stupid" is a no-no word.

05:30.862 --> 05:33.263
Keep that Dozer-pad
on you at all times.

05:33.264 --> 05:37.167
Fine, but I am gonna play
the hell out of some backgammon.

05:37.168 --> 05:38.168
Watch me.

05:42.340 --> 05:44.074
<i>Bouche Manger.</i>

05:44.075 --> 05:45.509
Oh, small plates,

05:45.510 --> 05:48.579
casual-chic ambiance,
no free soda refills...

05:48.580 --> 05:51.348
Jakey's going on a date.

05:51.382 --> 05:52.483
Are you going
on a date with Amy?

05:52.517 --> 05:53.784
What? No. Why?

05:53.818 --> 05:56.019
Uh, because you guys
just kissed on that mission.

05:56.020 --> 05:57.888
Charles, we just kissed
'cause we were undercover.

05:57.889 --> 06:00.290
- That's it.
- Yeah, it didn't mean anything.

06:00.325 --> 06:01.825
Not that it's any
of your business, Boyle,

06:01.826 --> 06:03.861
but the person
that I'm taking on a date

06:03.862 --> 06:05.929
is a girl from the gym.

06:05.964 --> 06:07.297
What?

06:07.298 --> 06:09.066
Why is this the first time
I'm hearing about her?

06:09.067 --> 06:10.634
Or that you go to the gym?

06:10.635 --> 06:12.169
Jake, avoid the weights.

06:12.170 --> 06:13.837
Nobody wants you turning
into another Terry.

06:13.838 --> 06:14.972
Ugh.

06:14.973 --> 06:17.207
Hey, people like
the way that I look.

06:17.208 --> 06:19.376
Sure they do, big guy.

06:19.411 --> 06:20.778
Look, I can't believe
you're gonna take

06:20.779 --> 06:22.813
some fitness floozy
to Bouche Manger.

06:22.814 --> 06:23.981
You should be going with Amy.

06:23.982 --> 06:25.149
Right, Amy?

06:25.150 --> 06:26.550
Uh...

06:26.551 --> 06:27.918
Whatever, dog.

06:27.919 --> 06:29.386
Date the flooze.

06:29.420 --> 06:30.554
See?

06:30.555 --> 06:32.723
It's never gonna happen,
Boyle, okay?

06:32.724 --> 06:34.892
Because I find Amy repulsive,

06:34.926 --> 06:37.494
and she finds me
extremely handsome.

06:37.529 --> 06:38.996
So stop pressuring us.

06:38.997 --> 06:41.064
Oh, you sweet, naive boy.

06:41.065 --> 06:43.534
I haven't even begun
to pressure you two.

06:43.535 --> 06:45.202
I've already written
my best man speech

06:45.203 --> 06:47.905
for your wedding.

06:47.906 --> 06:49.773
Oh, I'm gonna need you
to get married on a farm.

06:49.774 --> 06:52.376
A lot of my jokes
rely on that.

06:52.410 --> 06:55.846
So here we are,

06:55.847 --> 06:57.414
officially on a date,

06:57.449 --> 06:58.715
romantical date.

06:58.750 --> 07:00.517
Yes, we are.

07:00.518 --> 07:02.619
No longer just colleagues.

07:02.620 --> 07:04.888
Dating.

07:04.923 --> 07:06.890
You got a haircut.
It looks nice.

07:06.925 --> 07:08.425
Oh, thanks.

07:08.426 --> 07:09.760
You also got a haircut

07:09.794 --> 07:11.595
at some point in your life.

07:11.629 --> 07:13.030
I'm sure that's not
your baby hair.

07:13.031 --> 07:14.097
That would be crazy.

07:14.098 --> 07:15.432
But, uh...

07:15.433 --> 07:16.900
Yeah, you look very nice.

07:16.935 --> 07:19.002
<i>Domo arigato.</i>

07:19.037 --> 07:20.037
Do you speak Japanese?

07:20.071 --> 07:21.772
- No.
- Oh.

07:21.806 --> 07:23.941
Uh... sorry.

07:23.942 --> 07:26.577
I think I'm feeling
a little awkward.

07:26.611 --> 07:28.612
Yeah, me too.

07:28.646 --> 07:30.114
How do we make it not weird?

07:30.148 --> 07:32.082
I know.

07:32.083 --> 07:33.450
Let's just get super drunk.

07:33.485 --> 07:34.751
Yes, great idea.

07:34.786 --> 07:35.886
Pardon me, ma'am.

07:35.887 --> 07:37.821
Could you please bring us
four kamikaze shots?

07:37.822 --> 07:39.056
And four for me as well.

07:39.057 --> 07:40.691
Ah, I like your style.

07:40.692 --> 07:42.159
See, we can do this.

07:42.160 --> 07:43.260
We're back on track.

07:43.261 --> 07:45.896
We're keeping it
light and breezy.

07:45.930 --> 07:49.733
So we broke a rule.

07:49.734 --> 07:50.868
Yeah.

07:50.869 --> 07:52.736
I hope it wasn't a mistake.

07:52.737 --> 07:54.838
"I Hope It Wasn't a Mistake,"
title of your sex tape?

07:54.839 --> 07:57.574
Title of <i> our</i> sex tape.

07:59.886 --> 08:02.287
So how was the date
with the floozy?

08:02.288 --> 08:05.023
We are not leaving these seats
until you give me some deets.

08:06.459 --> 08:07.459
<i>All right, fine.</i>

08:07.460 --> 08:09.060
It started off a bit rocky,

08:09.095 --> 08:11.563
but it ended up
being really fun.

08:11.597 --> 08:12.931
Did you kiss?

08:12.932 --> 08:14.199
Did you french?

08:14.200 --> 08:15.867
Boyle, I'm not
gonna answer that.

08:15.868 --> 08:18.170
And no one over the age
of 12 says "french."

08:18.204 --> 08:21.006
Oh, that's a yes.
Oh, my God, you had sex.

08:22.041 --> 08:23.275
I can tell because
you're glowing.

08:23.309 --> 08:26.344
Ugh, Jake, no one wants
to hear about your sex life.

08:26.379 --> 08:28.079
You just asked me repeatedly.

08:28.114 --> 08:29.815
Because I was rooting
for you and Amy,

08:29.849 --> 08:31.783
but now I can see
you're super serious

08:31.784 --> 08:34.318
about this anonymous
gym seductress.

08:34.352 --> 08:36.288
Ugh, I'm so sorry, Amy.

08:36.289 --> 08:37.621
It doesn't matter to me.

08:37.623 --> 08:39.191
I'm... I would never date Jake.

08:39.192 --> 08:40.458
I work with Jake.

08:40.493 --> 08:41.893
I'd love to see you
date someone from work.

08:41.894 --> 08:43.128
Your head would explode.

08:43.129 --> 08:45.097
Your head would explode...

08:45.098 --> 08:47.566
because of how well
I would handle it.

08:47.567 --> 08:49.301
Mm. Sick burn.

08:49.335 --> 08:51.837
Peralta, Dozerman says
he wants to see you.

08:51.871 --> 08:54.339
Captain,
everything all right?

09:00.086 --> 09:01.179
You tell me.

09:01.214 --> 09:03.915
According to your Dozer-pad,
four of your coworkers

09:03.916 --> 09:06.318
have been gathered around your desk
for the last 90 seconds.

09:06.319 --> 09:08.353
Also, someone named
Norm Scully

09:08.354 --> 09:10.355
has been in the bathroom
for the last 72 minutes.

09:10.389 --> 09:12.657
Oh, yeah, that means
he's about halfway.

09:12.658 --> 09:14.226
But in regards
to the coworkers, sir,

09:14.227 --> 09:16.995
I was telling them I wanted
to get more work done,

09:16.996 --> 09:19.397
but all they wanted to do
was talk about my dating life,

09:19.432 --> 09:21.900
knowing full well
that my true love

09:21.901 --> 09:23.335
is efficiency.

09:23.336 --> 09:24.970
You know my motto, sir.

09:24.971 --> 09:27.072
Cho's before hos.

09:27.073 --> 09:28.507
"Cho's" is "chores."

09:31.110 --> 09:32.210
What?

09:34.080 --> 09:35.313
I like you.

09:35.314 --> 09:36.782
I could tell from
the moment I walked in here

09:36.783 --> 09:38.283
that we were one
and the same...

09:38.284 --> 09:40.986
detail-oriented,
love crunching numbers.

09:40.987 --> 09:42.387
Bet your apartment's
immaculate.

09:42.388 --> 09:43.522
Could probably eat
off the floor.

09:43.556 --> 09:45.857
- And I do. Yeah.
- Yeah.

09:45.858 --> 09:48.760
- I'm gonna handle this for you.
- Okay.

09:48.761 --> 09:52.664
I'm gonna send out
a Dozerblast.

09:52.665 --> 09:56.635
Hey, everyone stop talking
about Peralta's personal life.

09:56.636 --> 10:00.205
Dozerblast over.

10:00.206 --> 10:02.340
Well, thank you
very much, sir,

10:02.375 --> 10:05.677
and might I just say
that this has been a Dozerblast.

10:05.711 --> 10:07.079
I saw what you did
right there.

10:07.080 --> 10:08.080
Uh?

10:12.618 --> 10:14.386
- Get back to work.
- Okay.

10:14.420 --> 10:15.754
<i>I know you've been working</i>

10:15.788 --> 10:17.689
on picking a name
for the pigeon mascot

10:17.690 --> 10:19.491
for, uh...

10:19.492 --> 10:20.759
Several months now.

10:20.793 --> 10:22.294
<i>I feel like you might
need a breather,</i>

10:22.328 --> 10:25.163
so I've prepared
an eight-point presentation

10:25.164 --> 10:26.832
on community engagement.

10:26.866 --> 10:28.700
We'll get to your presentation,
Raymond.

10:28.701 --> 10:29.835
It's on the agenda.

10:29.869 --> 10:31.837
Well, it says here
it's scheduled

10:31.838 --> 10:33.472
"after everyone leaves."

10:33.506 --> 10:34.573
And not a minute later.

10:34.574 --> 10:36.441
Trent, Bryce, where
are we with the name?

10:36.476 --> 10:38.610
We've narrowed it down
to two choices...

10:38.611 --> 10:40.212
Petey or Paulie.

10:40.246 --> 10:41.847
<i>With all due respect,</i>

10:41.881 --> 10:44.349
that pigeon is
clearly a Ray J.

10:44.350 --> 10:46.218
Hi.
Gina Linetti,

10:46.219 --> 10:49.354
the human form
of the 100 emoji.

10:49.355 --> 10:51.456
I'd like to hear Captain
Holt's thoughts on a name.

10:51.491 --> 10:53.825
Very well.
My thoughts are...

10:53.826 --> 10:54.826
who cares?

10:54.861 --> 10:56.628
Give us a name, Raymond.

10:56.629 --> 10:57.662
Weigh in on this.

10:57.663 --> 10:58.663
It's your job now.

10:58.698 --> 11:00.265
No.

11:00.299 --> 11:01.900
A name.

11:01.901 --> 11:03.435
Petey or Paulie, which is it?

11:03.469 --> 11:04.636
What does it matter?

11:04.637 --> 11:05.871
Why'd you even choose
a pigeon anyway?

11:05.872 --> 11:07.105
It's a terrible mascot.

11:07.106 --> 11:08.507
Because they're
a staple of New York,

11:08.508 --> 11:10.308
they're nonthreatening,
and they're everywhere.

11:10.343 --> 11:11.610
They're carriers of disease,

11:11.611 --> 11:13.412
and they eat garbage!

11:13.446 --> 11:14.880
Name the pigeon, Raymond!

11:14.881 --> 11:17.415
- You can't make me.
- <i>I can make you, and I will.</i>

11:17.416 --> 11:19.551
Name the pigeon.
That's an order!

11:25.925 --> 11:27.025
Paulie.

11:27.026 --> 11:28.093
Thank you.

11:28.094 --> 11:29.094
Was that so hard?

11:31.197 --> 11:32.998
Yeah, I'm trying
to find some evidence.

11:32.999 --> 11:34.766
I'm just gonna look in here.

11:34.767 --> 11:36.601
Another perfect cover.
Two for two. Nailed it.

11:36.602 --> 11:38.103
All right,
I talked to Dozerman

11:38.104 --> 11:40.405
and convinced him to outlaw
all personal talk at work.

11:40.406 --> 11:41.406
We're in the clear.

11:41.440 --> 11:42.774
And everyone
hates you for that,

11:42.775 --> 11:45.510
but this is totally working,
and no one knows.

11:45.511 --> 11:46.812
I know.
It's the best.

11:46.846 --> 11:48.246
And you know what?
I'm glad we broke the rule

11:48.247 --> 11:49.581
and had sex
on the first date.

11:49.582 --> 11:51.983
Me too, 'cause we're,
like, really good at it.

11:51.984 --> 11:53.785
- So good, right?
- Stupid good.

11:53.820 --> 11:55.087
It makes no sense.

11:55.121 --> 11:56.421
We're light and breezy.

11:56.422 --> 11:58.156
If we want to break rules,
break rules.

11:58.191 --> 11:59.658
Like, what's another
rule we could break?

11:59.692 --> 12:01.359
No making out at work.

12:01.394 --> 12:03.662
Okay, that's
very flattering, Amy,

12:03.663 --> 12:06.298
but there are some rules
that I shall never...

12:06.299 --> 12:08.233
- Let's go.
- Okay.

12:08.267 --> 12:09.968
<i>Warning.
Unknown environment.</i>

12:09.969 --> 12:11.670
<i>Unknown environment.</i>

12:11.704 --> 12:13.105
What's that noise?

12:13.139 --> 12:14.639
I don't hear anything.

12:14.640 --> 12:16.341
<i>Warning.
Unknown environment.</i>

12:16.342 --> 12:19.044
<i>Unknown environment.</i>

12:19.045 --> 12:21.980
<i>Warning.
Unknown environment.</i>

12:21.981 --> 12:23.682
What? I put it up there
for safe keeping.

12:23.716 --> 12:25.250
- Safe keeping?
- Yeah.

12:25.284 --> 12:28.553
I had it on my desk, but
I kept spilling coffee on it.

12:28.554 --> 12:30.021
- Oops.
<i>- Tamper alert.</i>

12:30.056 --> 12:31.923
- <i>Tamper alert.</i>
- Come on, Diaz.

12:31.958 --> 12:34.926
You two have been
in this evidence locker for...

12:34.927 --> 12:37.295
- Hey!
- What? Nothing.

12:37.296 --> 12:39.531
Nothing... you were just
making out with Peralta.

12:39.565 --> 12:42.701
Ah, there's that candy bar
wrapper I was looking for.

12:42.702 --> 12:44.036
Oh, Santiago,
what are you doing here?

12:45.138 --> 12:47.038
So I guess it is
hos before cho's

12:47.039 --> 12:48.440
with you, friend.

12:48.474 --> 12:50.776
Now I understand why nothing
gets done in this precinct.

12:50.777 --> 12:53.145
The detectives are too busy
frenching with each other,

12:53.179 --> 12:54.179
but you know what?

12:54.180 --> 12:56.615
Your little honeymoon
is over!

12:56.616 --> 12:59.518
'Cause as long as I'm here,
you two are done!

12:59.552 --> 13:02.421
And I'm gonna be here
a long, long, long,

13:02.422 --> 13:04.556
long, long, long,
long, long...

13:06.459 --> 13:07.592
Oh, this is a heart attack.

13:07.593 --> 13:08.927
This right here,
this is a heart attack.

13:08.928 --> 13:10.429
Ooh, it's a big one.
Ooh, ooh, ooh.

13:10.430 --> 13:12.197
Oh, oh, oh.

13:12.231 --> 13:13.365
I'm gonna get help.

13:13.399 --> 13:15.066
Sir, it's all right.
We're getting help.

13:15.067 --> 13:16.068
Okay.

13:16.069 --> 13:20.138
Tell my wife
that I love her...

13:20.139 --> 13:22.007
work ethic.

13:29.310 --> 13:30.343
What happened in there?

13:30.377 --> 13:32.345
Nothing.
We were just working,

13:32.346 --> 13:33.513
separately.

13:33.514 --> 13:35.815
Yeah, and then Dozerman
just came in and died.

13:35.816 --> 13:36.883
Peacefully,

13:36.884 --> 13:38.151
like an old cat.

13:38.152 --> 13:39.819
Can you think of anything

13:39.820 --> 13:41.955
that may have caused Dozerman
to be startled?

13:41.956 --> 13:43.690
Ah...

13:43.691 --> 13:45.825
Nope. Uh...

13:45.826 --> 13:47.127
He might have been startled

13:47.128 --> 13:49.162
by how far apart
we were standing.

13:49.163 --> 13:50.797
That seems unlikely,

13:50.798 --> 13:53.667
but obviously he had
a ton of health problems,

13:53.668 --> 13:55.635
so, you know, this seems
pretty open and shut.

13:55.636 --> 13:57.537
Do me a favor and pull
the surveillance tapes.

13:57.538 --> 14:00.373
Right,
the surveillance tapes.

14:00.408 --> 14:03.043
Yep, because this is
a police precinct.

14:03.044 --> 14:05.812
You two have something
to tell me?

14:05.813 --> 14:07.247
All right, fine.

14:07.248 --> 14:11.084
Detective Santiago
and I may have been in there

14:11.085 --> 14:12.085
snorking.

14:12.086 --> 14:13.620
Yes!

14:13.621 --> 14:14.921
Oh!

14:14.922 --> 14:16.856
Wait.
What about the gym floozy?

14:16.857 --> 14:18.691
Amy was the gym floozy.

14:18.692 --> 14:20.560
The gym floozy
was under my nose

14:20.561 --> 14:21.561
the whole time.

14:21.562 --> 14:23.630
Oh, I am over the moon.

14:23.631 --> 14:25.231
- Okay.
- Over the moon.

14:25.266 --> 14:27.067
- All right.
- So what is this?

14:27.101 --> 14:28.101
Casual? Serious?

14:28.102 --> 14:29.436
I need to know
how to make fun of you.

14:29.437 --> 14:30.437
You guys dating?

14:30.438 --> 14:31.438
- Yes.
- No.

14:31.439 --> 14:32.539
Oh, that's not good.

14:32.540 --> 14:33.706
I mean, yes.

14:33.707 --> 14:34.974
I just said no
because of the rules.

14:34.975 --> 14:36.242
We said we weren't
gonna tell anyone.

14:36.277 --> 14:37.410
It's very new,

14:37.411 --> 14:38.745
and we're still
figuring it out.

14:38.746 --> 14:40.513
Enough.
Look.

14:40.514 --> 14:42.415
Terry loves love,

14:42.416 --> 14:46.252
but Terry also loves maintaining
a professional work environment.

14:46.253 --> 14:47.887
As your commanding officer,

14:47.888 --> 14:51.224
I am very disappointed
in both of you.

14:55.129 --> 14:56.763
- So, Boyle...
- Mm.

14:56.764 --> 14:59.299
Let's go look at those
surveillance tapes, yeah?

14:59.300 --> 15:02.769
- Oh, absolutely.
- Mm.

15:02.770 --> 15:05.872
Captain, I know this
isn't my place to say,

15:05.873 --> 15:07.774
but Madeline Wuntch
is here to see you.

15:07.808 --> 15:09.576
Actually that's exactly
your place to say.

15:09.577 --> 15:11.077
You are my assistant.

15:11.078 --> 15:13.446
What precisely did you
think your job was?

15:13.481 --> 15:15.715
Ideally?
Bullfighter.

15:15.716 --> 15:17.384
But it's such a boys' club.

15:17.418 --> 15:19.385
- Hmm.
- Ooh.

15:19.386 --> 15:21.254
I like what you've done
with your office, Raymond.

15:21.255 --> 15:22.355
It's cozy,

15:22.390 --> 15:25.525
like a shoebox one buries
a dead hamster in.

15:25.559 --> 15:27.560
So what did you want
to see me about?

15:27.595 --> 15:29.462
I'd like to propose a truce.

15:29.463 --> 15:30.664
Our feud is
getting in the way

15:30.665 --> 15:32.098
of the NYPD's business.

15:32.099 --> 15:34.334
Madeline, the PR
department is a joke.

15:34.335 --> 15:35.835
Their work here
is meaningless.

15:35.870 --> 15:38.238
Nine weeks to choose
the name Paulie.

15:38.272 --> 15:40.407
I knew instantly
it should be Pepper,

15:40.408 --> 15:42.342
Officer Pepper O'Pigeon.

15:42.376 --> 15:44.277
Maybe we should start
the whole naming process

15:44.278 --> 15:45.779
all over again.

15:45.813 --> 15:48.281
I could turn this department
around if you'd let me.

15:48.282 --> 15:49.482
You're wasting my talents.

15:49.517 --> 15:51.184
This man is a Timberlake,

15:51.185 --> 15:53.486
and you need to stop
treating him like a Fatone.

15:53.521 --> 15:56.523
Yes, yes,
perhaps you're right.

15:56.524 --> 15:58.591
Perhaps I am wasting
your talents.

15:58.592 --> 16:02.262
I want you to spread
your wings, as it were.

16:02.263 --> 16:04.330
I think we've found
the perfect person

16:04.331 --> 16:05.832
to wear the pigeon costume.

16:05.833 --> 16:07.667
It's you, Raymond.

16:07.668 --> 16:09.602
Do we need to get
the costume altered,

16:09.603 --> 16:11.171
or do you have
your own pigeon pants?

16:11.205 --> 16:15.609
No, Madeline, I don't
have my own pigeon pants.

16:15.610 --> 16:18.778
<i>You are
43 minutes behind.</i>

16:18.779 --> 16:20.347
I know.
Get off my back, computer ghost.

16:20.348 --> 16:22.449
Why are you still playing
with that stupid game, Sarge?

16:22.450 --> 16:24.250
- The guy is dead.
- It's not a game.

16:24.251 --> 16:25.819
I'm following
our captain's orders.

16:25.820 --> 16:27.153
His orders were stupid.

16:27.154 --> 16:29.422
I hated him more
than any cop I've ever known.

16:30.825 --> 16:32.325
Whoa.

16:32.326 --> 16:34.861
I just realized I'm never gonna
be able to say that to his face.

16:34.862 --> 16:36.696
I mean, I could say it
to his wife at the funeral,

16:36.697 --> 16:37.864
but it won't be the same.

16:37.865 --> 16:39.499
He was trying to make
our precinct better.

16:39.500 --> 16:41.034
Look. Holt's gone.

16:41.035 --> 16:42.135
Dozerman died.

16:42.136 --> 16:43.603
Who knows who we're
getting next?

16:43.604 --> 16:45.138
I'm just trying to keep
this place running.

16:45.139 --> 16:46.959
That's my job.

16:47.975 --> 16:49.042
Case cleared!

16:49.043 --> 16:51.144
Yeah, how do you
like me now, sucker?

16:51.145 --> 16:54.381
I mean,
I hope you found peace.

16:54.415 --> 16:56.616
Hey, so everybody
knows about us now,

16:56.617 --> 16:58.284
which means all the rules
have been broken

16:58.285 --> 16:59.319
and nothing bad happened.

16:59.320 --> 17:00.620
Nothing bad happened?

17:00.621 --> 17:03.156
Terry yelled at us,
and we killed our captain.

17:03.157 --> 17:06.092
Jake, is this a bad idea?

17:06.093 --> 17:08.060
It seems like the universe
is sending us a lot of signs

17:08.061 --> 17:09.396
that we should
hit the brakes.

17:09.396 --> 17:11.397
Hasn't exactly been
light and breezy.

17:11.398 --> 17:13.133
Yeah, it's been a little more

17:13.134 --> 17:14.867
stressful and death-y.

17:14.868 --> 17:17.069
You have to admit
it hasn't started out great.

17:17.070 --> 17:19.339
What do you want to do, then?

17:19.339 --> 17:21.340
Go back to being colleagues?

17:21.342 --> 17:22.942
Yeah.

17:22.943 --> 17:25.244
Maybe that's what it
needs to be right now.

17:27.448 --> 17:28.448
Okay.

17:28.449 --> 17:30.250
Okay.

17:30.251 --> 17:31.418
<i>♪
♪</i>

17:31.452 --> 17:32.519
Sorry.

17:32.520 --> 17:36.890
<i>♪
♪</i>

17:38.356 --> 17:39.810
No, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no...

17:39.811 --> 17:41.388
Boyle, can we please
just go to dinner?

17:41.389 --> 17:43.034
No, no, no, no, no!

17:43.035 --> 17:45.176
This is not how you and Amy
are supposed to end.

17:45.211 --> 17:46.744
You're supposed to grow old

17:46.745 --> 17:47.979
and die holding each other

17:47.980 --> 17:49.981
as your cruise ship
slowly takes on water.

17:49.982 --> 17:51.082
What do you want me to say?

17:51.083 --> 17:52.584
We tried really hard.
We made rules.

17:52.585 --> 17:53.818
We kept it light and breezy.

17:53.853 --> 17:54.986
Light and breezy?

17:55.020 --> 17:56.187
Ow!

17:56.222 --> 17:57.522
Light and breezy
is how you describe

17:57.523 --> 17:58.790
a linen pantsuit,

17:58.791 --> 18:00.825
not a relationship
you care about.

18:00.826 --> 18:02.460
We were just being cautious.

18:02.461 --> 18:04.329
- Cautious?
- Ow!

18:04.330 --> 18:06.564
You guys started this
with one foot out the door.

18:06.565 --> 18:08.466
That's what doomed you,
not the universe.

18:08.467 --> 18:10.035
Actually, it makes
a lot of sense.

18:10.036 --> 18:12.504
Ow, I was agreeing with you!

18:12.538 --> 18:13.571
I'm sorry.

18:13.572 --> 18:14.839
I'm just so excited
about all this!

18:14.874 --> 18:16.341
All right, so what do I do?

18:16.342 --> 18:17.709
- Tell me.
- Easy.

18:17.710 --> 18:19.878
You march over there,
you tell her how you feel,

18:19.912 --> 18:21.579
and you bring a fancy bottle
of lavender shampoo,

18:21.580 --> 18:22.814
because shampooing
a woman's head

18:22.815 --> 18:24.549
is the most erotic thing
you could ever possibly...

18:24.550 --> 18:26.017
No, no, no shampoo.
That's the worst.

18:26.018 --> 18:27.519
But I am gonna go over there.

18:27.520 --> 18:28.720
I'm gonna tell her
how I feel.

18:28.754 --> 18:29.821
Yes!
Go get her.

18:29.822 --> 18:31.856
No!
Wait till it starts raining.

18:31.857 --> 18:33.324
No, that's crazy.
Go now.

18:33.325 --> 18:34.893
Okay.

18:36.662 --> 18:38.463
- Ahh!
- Sorry! Sorry.

18:38.464 --> 18:39.898
It's okay.

18:39.899 --> 18:41.499
I was home,

18:41.500 --> 18:44.069
and I really wanted
to talk to someone about us

18:44.103 --> 18:46.071
and Dozerman
and about Holt being gone,

18:46.072 --> 18:48.640
and then I realized
that the only person

18:48.641 --> 18:51.576
I want to talk about
that stuff with is you.

18:51.577 --> 18:54.879
So screw just being
colleagues,

18:54.880 --> 18:57.415
and screw light
and breezy, right?

18:59.351 --> 19:00.352
Definitely.

19:02.054 --> 19:03.054
Guys, we did it.

19:03.055 --> 19:04.055
We really did it.

19:04.056 --> 19:06.358
Oh, Charles is here.

19:06.392 --> 19:07.425
Big time.

19:08.694 --> 19:09.894
<i>Captain.</i>

19:09.929 --> 19:12.097
The kids want to know
where Paulie the Pigeon is.

19:12.098 --> 19:14.132
I told 'em he got sucked up
into an airplane engine.

19:14.133 --> 19:15.367
Is that all right?

19:15.368 --> 19:17.669
I can't put
that pigeon head on, Gina.

19:17.670 --> 19:19.804
Wuntch has defeated me.

19:19.805 --> 19:21.039
This is how it ends,

19:21.040 --> 19:22.774
with me standing on
the urine-soaked floor

19:22.775 --> 19:24.109
of an elementary
school bathroom

19:24.110 --> 19:27.045
in a third-rate
bird costume.

19:27.046 --> 19:28.446
- I quit.
- <i>No.</i>

19:28.481 --> 19:31.282
I did not follow you to PR
to watch you quit.

19:31.317 --> 19:33.585
I followed you
because you're great

19:33.619 --> 19:36.421
and because you make
everything you touch better,

19:36.422 --> 19:39.457
and I figured PR
would be the easiest path

19:39.458 --> 19:42.171
to launching my reality show
"Linetti, Set, Go."

19:42.172 --> 19:44.159
I thought your reality
show was to be called

19:44.160 --> 19:45.427
"Gina in a Bottle."

19:45.428 --> 19:47.596
No, that was
my fragrance line.

19:47.597 --> 19:48.864
Keep up.

19:48.865 --> 19:50.198
Listen.

19:50.199 --> 19:52.634
You cannot let Wuntch
defeat you.

19:52.635 --> 19:54.302
<i>That is not who you are.</i>

19:54.303 --> 19:56.138
You are a person
who will go out there

19:56.139 --> 19:58.931
and deliver his eight-point plan
on whatever, whatever.

19:58.932 --> 20:00.432
- Community engagement.
- Whatever.

20:00.863 --> 20:03.298
Even if the only
people listening

20:03.299 --> 20:05.233
are a bunch of second graders,

20:05.234 --> 20:08.303
because Captain Raymond Holt

20:08.304 --> 20:10.706
never gives up!

20:10.740 --> 20:12.074
Inspiring words.

20:12.108 --> 20:13.875
I'm going to give
that speech.

20:13.910 --> 20:16.745
Help me with that
pigeon head.

20:16.746 --> 20:18.914
Yeah, all right.

20:20.783 --> 20:23.452
Let's blow some tiny minds.

20:25.088 --> 20:28.257
<i>Rosa Diaz, you are
six hours ahead of schedule.</i>

20:28.258 --> 20:29.825
<i>Great job.</i>

20:29.859 --> 20:31.393
Wow, Diaz.

20:31.394 --> 20:33.462
That's the first time
I've seen him smile.

20:33.463 --> 20:34.529
I didn't do it for him.

20:34.530 --> 20:35.931
I did it 'cause it's my job.

20:35.965 --> 20:38.066
- We cool?
- We're cool.

20:38.101 --> 20:40.602
Good.

20:41.838 --> 20:43.739
<i>Damage.
Critical damage.</i>

20:47.810 --> 20:50.145
There's a rumor the new
captain'll be here today.

20:50.179 --> 20:52.848
<i>Now, I don't know
who Wuntch is sending us,</i>

20:52.882 --> 20:54.549
<i>but it doesn't matter,</i>

20:54.550 --> 20:56.251
<i>because we're a family,</i>

20:56.252 --> 20:57.486
<i>we're strong,</i>

20:57.487 --> 20:59.855
<i>and together,
we can do anything.</i>

20:59.889 --> 21:02.057
Nine-Nine!
Nine-Nine!

21:04.694 --> 21:06.528
What's up, ding-dongs?

21:06.529 --> 21:07.663
I'm your new captain.

21:07.697 --> 21:09.364
- The Vulture.
- No.

21:09.365 --> 21:10.365
Still hot.

21:10.400 --> 21:12.034
Now, I know we have
our history,

21:12.035 --> 21:13.969
me vulturing your cases,

21:13.970 --> 21:15.871
me telling you
to eat my farts,

21:15.905 --> 21:17.039
<i>but that's all in the past,</i>

21:17.040 --> 21:18.807
'cause now that I run
this precinct,

21:18.808 --> 21:22.778
things are gonna get
much, much worse.

21:22.779 --> 21:24.379
So suck it.

21:24.414 --> 21:27.049
No!
