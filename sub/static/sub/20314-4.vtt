10:17.458 --> 10:20.375
-Oh, well yeah. An Equestrian.
I used to be, it's been a
long time.

10:20.417 --> 10:22.917
I'm a little out of shape.
-No...

10:22.959 --> 10:26.792
We're all, we're all out of
shape. I'm out of shape,
you're out of shape.

10:26.834 --> 10:29.250
-I'd like to get back into it
though. It's really good
exercise.

10:29.291 --> 10:31.625
-That'd be great if you got
back into shape, me too.

10:31.667 --> 10:33.792
I should get back, everyone
should be in shape all the time.

10:33.834 --> 10:36.500
-Or we could just
give up coolers.

10:36.542 --> 10:39.375
-[Laughs]: Nooo!
-[Laughs]: No. No.

10:39.417 --> 10:42.792
Let's do a shot.
-Why not? Let's do shots.

10:42.834 --> 10:45.250
-You choose, you choose. Pick
something green for the celtics.

10:45.291 --> 10:49.709
-Right.

-Yeah, obvious Keegan,
that you're happy. I get that.

11:11.000 --> 11:13.959
But you're...You're good
with this Lori?

11:14.000 --> 11:16.834
-Couldn't be better, sir.
-Couldn't be better?

11:16.875 --> 11:19.417
Well, what makes it work?
-We're best friends, sir.

11:19.458 --> 11:22.375
Just, we think the same
things are funny.

11:22.417 --> 11:25.834
We have so much in common and we
just hang out together, all the
time.

11:25.875 --> 11:29.375
-Well, when you first saw each
other, when you first saw each
other let's go back to that day.

11:29.417 --> 11:31.709
You didn't know all that, you
didn't know all that stuff.

11:31.750 --> 11:35.625
And I get Keegan that when
you saw Lori, you were like

11:35.667 --> 11:40.333
"What? Huh? Shut the front door"

11:40.375 --> 11:42.667
You hit the jackpot right?
Like, that's what people say.

11:42.709 --> 11:44.625
You're like "Jackpot!"

11:45.834 --> 11:48.542
You still felt that...
When...

11:48.583 --> 11:52.333
-Well I think it was just...
-Okay, this is really more of
a Lori question.

11:52.375 --> 11:55.208
Do you see what I'm saying?
-Mmm, I don't understand.

11:55.250 --> 11:59.667
-Let's be honest, when you
looked back what did you see?

11:59.709 --> 12:02.083
-[Laughs]: Keegan.
-Haha, Keegan.

12:02.125 --> 12:05.333
-Haven't you ever just clicked
with somebody sir?

12:05.375 --> 12:07.750
-Yeah, I have.
-It's great, isn't it?

12:10.625 --> 12:11.709
-Yeah, it is great.

12:13.291 --> 12:15.750
-Alright Bobbi you're in charge.
Let's get this show on the road.

12:15.792 --> 12:17.750
-Yeah, no problem. Okay, can
everybody just look this way?

12:17.792 --> 12:20.291
Actually Dwyer, can you go stand
over there?

12:20.333 --> 12:23.291
And, ah, wow. That is...
A tight shirt.

-[Callaghan]: What's wrong?

12:25.583 --> 12:28.625
-Nothing, nope. All is good.
Yeah, Alex can you go stand
in front? There.

-What a woman.

-No, no arguments. I want that

-Oh, I didn't know.
-It's all anyone's talking

There's a difference Gerry.

Shallow's when you live it.

should live it.

who cares right?

could hang out with her all day.

shape, what if she got back
in shape?

perfect.

-Yeah, yeah. Yeah, no, no.

-No, I just I never know
when they do this.

-Noo.

you saying that nothing's going
to...?

16:16.208 --> 16:18.625
I know it's just friends,
but why?

16:18.667 --> 16:20.750
-It's just, this would never
work out between the two of us.

16:20.792 --> 16:24.375
-Yeah, yeah. No no I don't
think, I never thought it would
either.

16:24.417 --> 16:26.583
But why are you saying it
wouldn't work out?

16:26.625 --> 16:31.750

I'm not attracted to um...

16:31.792 --> 16:33.417

-I'm sure other girls are.

16:37.000 --> 16:40.792
I bet other girls are.
Not me though.

16:40.834 --> 16:43.375
-You are not attracted.
-Please stop.

-Let's figure out,
let's pinpoint.

16:52.792 --> 16:55.166
-Don't do this.
-What is it? Maybe I
could fix it.

16:55.208 --> 16:57.166
-It's your teeth.

16:59.709 --> 17:02.875
Your teeth are way to
big for your head.

17:02.917 --> 17:05.583

[Whispers]: They're gigantic.

17:05.625 --> 17:08.750

is wow! My teeth...

17:13.125 --> 17:16.792

can't hang out?

17:16.834 --> 17:18.792

-Yeah...

not doing that obviously?

I love it.

18:12.458 --> 18:15.917

wears the uniform.

18:24.625 --> 18:27.041

-How is it different?

18:27.083 --> 18:30.500

about...

What you're doing and
it's not appropriate.

18:32.959 --> 18:35.834

-Nobody has a fantasy
about that.

18:35.875 --> 18:38.458

Donald.

18:49.792 --> 18:52.208
-Irregardlessly.

19:03.792 --> 19:05.750
-Wow!
-That proves my point.

19:05.792 --> 19:08.000
I want you to go back to your
classroom and take that off.

19:08.041 --> 19:10.625
-Maybe do that in the bathroom.
-Same goes for you Simon.

19:10.667 --> 19:12.750

bit unattractive...
