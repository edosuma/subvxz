01:05.230 --> 01:07.199
D'oh!

01:11.004 --> 01:12.904
Whoo-ohh!

01:23.416 --> 01:26.783
Are you sick of
ordinary-shaped amusement parks?

01:26.886 --> 01:30.982
- Am I ever!
- Then be the first family on your block...

01:31.091 --> 01:32.991
to visit Blockoland...

01:33.093 --> 01:37.325
the amusement park made entirely
of Blocko brand assembly fun blocks.

01:39.165 --> 01:42.532
So, how much did you love Blockoland?

01:42.635 --> 01:44.227
It was all right, I guess.

01:44.337 --> 01:47.534
Kids, how would you...

01:47.640 --> 01:51.303
like to go to... Blockoland?

01:51.411 --> 01:54.642
- Meh.
- But the TV gave me the impression that-

01:54.747 --> 01:58.877
- We said, "Meh."
- M-E-H. "Meh."

01:58.985 --> 02:02.352
Well, I'd like to go.
How about you, Maggie?

02:07.026 --> 02:09.221
Aww!

02:09.329 --> 02:11.229
Huh?

02:11.331 --> 02:13.231
Maggie, no!

02:13.333 --> 02:17.702
Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!

02:17.804 --> 02:19.704
We're here.

02:23.943 --> 02:26.138
Howdy, partner.

02:26.246 --> 02:29.409
Four score and seven blocks ago, my-
Aah! Aah!

02:31.518 --> 02:34.487
Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!

02:34.587 --> 02:36.487
Whee!

02:39.659 --> 02:42.219
Okay. We have our choice
of Rectangle Land...

02:42.328 --> 02:44.694
Cube Country or Squaresville.

02:44.797 --> 02:47.061
Squaresville sounds pretty cool.

02:50.170 --> 02:53.139
I am a robot. Do what I say.

02:55.241 --> 02:58.870
I am a washing machine.
Do what I say.

03:02.715 --> 03:04.683
Take that! In the face!

03:08.655 --> 03:10.748
You knocked his block off!

03:10.857 --> 03:13.382
Come with me.

03:16.663 --> 03:20.155
Check it out.
I built myself a healthy apple.

03:20.266 --> 03:22.234
But you made it out of ham cubes.

03:22.335 --> 03:24.860
Yup. A shiny new apple.

03:27.941 --> 03:31.638
I get it!
Everything's made of blocks!

03:31.744 --> 03:36.204
- Even the water!
- Uh, hey! Ow!

03:36.316 --> 03:38.443
Hey, Boat 28, stop splashing.

03:38.551 --> 03:41.042
What are you gonna do about it?

03:42.422 --> 03:44.856
Uh-oh. Aah!

03:50.530 --> 03:52.896
Leeches!

03:55.034 --> 03:58.663
Ow! Why did I get this LEGO shirt?

03:58.771 --> 04:00.739
Don't you mean "Blocko" shirt?

04:00.840 --> 04:03.308
Right, right. "Blocko" shirt.

04:03.409 --> 04:05.502
Lisa, how's your Eiffel Tower kit?

04:05.612 --> 04:08.513
It's okay, but it's missing a piece.

04:08.615 --> 04:10.583
Welcome to real life, Lisa.

04:10.683 --> 04:13.982
You can't fight city hall,
a.k.a. Blockoland.

04:14.087 --> 04:15.987
So don't even try!

04:16.089 --> 04:18.887
What kind of a thing is that
to tell your children?

04:18.992 --> 04:20.926
It's what I always tell them.

04:21.027 --> 04:24.519
I told them that twice yesterday,
and then again as they were going to sleep.

04:24.631 --> 04:28.567
I'm sure the gift shop
will replace the missing piece.

04:28.668 --> 04:31.136
You're right, honey. Hear that, kids?

04:31.237 --> 04:33.797
The Simpsons are going to Blockoland!

04:33.906 --> 04:35.806
Yea!

04:35.908 --> 04:37.773
Excuse me.

04:46.386 --> 04:48.946
You sold my little girl
a shoddy Eiffel Tower.

04:49.055 --> 04:52.252
Hey, tough luck, pal.
You can't fight the souvenir industry.

04:52.358 --> 04:55.156
- We're too powerful.
- Yeah, you're right.

04:58.431 --> 05:02.993
But before I go, I'm gonna give you
a little souvenir of my own!

05:06.339 --> 05:08.671
Oh, what the hey.

05:09.842 --> 05:12.208
- Here you go.
- Thank you, Dad.

05:12.312 --> 05:16.078
Hey, any friend of Marge
is a friend of mine.

05:17.483 --> 05:20.316
- So, how's that new block I got ya?
- Great!

05:20.420 --> 05:24.948
You know, standing up
for the little guy felt good.

05:25.058 --> 05:27.117
I'm gonna do it more often.

05:29.762 --> 05:33.129
Mmm. Hmm!

05:34.300 --> 05:37.133
- Scram!
- Those bullies are gone now.

05:37.236 --> 05:41.332
You idiot!
They were beating out my shirt fire.

05:41.441 --> 05:44.171
My heart was in the right place, jerk!

05:48.181 --> 05:50.706
There. Thanks again, Dad.

05:50.817 --> 05:52.910
Well, you're welcome, honey.

05:53.019 --> 05:57.080
Now I'm gonna spend the whole day
helping schmoes with their problems.

05:57.190 --> 06:00.990
- Got a problem, Bart?
- The girl at school won't go to the dance with me.

06:01.094 --> 06:02.789
Bart's got a girlfriend.

06:02.895 --> 06:04.863
No, I don't.
That's the problem.

06:04.964 --> 06:07.398
Bart's got a problem.

06:07.500 --> 06:10.060
Don't worry, Son. I'll handle this.

06:15.908 --> 06:18.604
Come on.
Why won't you go out with Bart?

06:18.711 --> 06:21.441
He's a smelly, ugly dork!

06:21.547 --> 06:24.983
Please, "ugly" is such a smelly word.

06:25.084 --> 06:28.053
- Who would you rather go out with?
- Tommy.

06:29.989 --> 06:33.083
Well, duh. He's breathtaking.

06:33.192 --> 06:36.821
But Bart has inner beauty,
like you'd find in a rodent.

06:40.099 --> 06:42.465
And face it, you're no prize either.

06:42.568 --> 06:44.627
You wear braces,
you dress like a kid...

06:44.737 --> 06:46.705
and you're not getting any younger.

06:46.806 --> 06:48.865
- Take what you can get.
- He's right.

06:48.975 --> 06:51.307
Grab something and don't let go.

06:51.411 --> 06:54.209
Well, Bart's not so bad.

06:57.250 --> 07:01.118
They wouldn't honor
my coupon for two free streaks.

07:01.220 --> 07:04.280
They wouldn't?
Well, I'll go to bat for you, honey.

07:07.927 --> 07:10.327
- Hmm!
- Yes. May I help you?

07:10.430 --> 07:13.593
Nice place you got here.
Oh, look. A hairnet.

07:13.699 --> 07:16.293
Be a shame if it was...

07:16.402 --> 07:18.893
hurled to the ground.

07:21.307 --> 07:24.606
Ooh! How clumsy of me.

07:24.710 --> 07:26.769
And-

07:26.879 --> 07:29.575
- Whoops!
- Why are you doing these things?

07:29.682 --> 07:33.209
Either you honor my wife's coupon,
or a lot more lids will be unscrewed!

07:33.319 --> 07:35.844
But I cannot streak that much hair.

07:35.955 --> 07:39.482
- Think of the cost. I'd be ruined!
- Oh, really?

07:41.227 --> 07:44.993
Boy, you weren't kidding.
Your profit margins are razor thin!

07:45.097 --> 07:47.964
- You see? This is what I'm-
- Wait a minute.

07:48.067 --> 07:50.729
400 a month for loafer lightener?

07:50.837 --> 07:54.534
But we must have it.
It is the lifeblood of the industry.

07:56.709 --> 07:59.678
You get the same results
with a mincing gel.

07:59.779 --> 08:03.943
But of course!
I will save thousands! Thank you!

08:04.050 --> 08:08.111
Oh, Homie, I love them.
I can't thank you enough.

08:08.221 --> 08:10.883
The satisfaction of helping
another human being...

08:10.990 --> 08:14.289
is all the thanks l- et cetera.

08:16.028 --> 08:19.828
And I gave that man directions
even though I didn't know the way...

08:19.932 --> 08:23.424
'cause that's the kind of guy
I am this week.

08:27.039 --> 08:30.907
Ah! Lousy Isotopes.
They're a disgrace to baseball.

08:31.010 --> 08:32.909
- They lost again?
- Mm-hmm.

08:33.011 --> 08:37.448
The team's been terrible since they got bought
by the cheap, heartless Duff Corporation.

08:37.549 --> 08:39.609
Hey, Moe. Give me a Duff.

08:40.785 --> 08:44.347
Mmm. Oh, yeah. Sweet Duff.

08:44.457 --> 08:48.120
Wait a minute. Duff owns
the Springfield Isotopes? Since when?

08:48.227 --> 08:50.457
They bought 'em a year ago
from the Mafia.

08:50.563 --> 08:52.827
It was the last
of the family-owned teams.

08:52.932 --> 08:55.924
I tried to return my season ticket,
but they wouldn't give me my money back.

08:56.035 --> 08:57.935
They said <i>they</i> wanted it.

08:58.037 --> 09:00.631
Say no more. I'll help you, Lenny.

09:00.740 --> 09:04.073
- <i>You</i> want to help me?
- Well, haven't you heard? He's the new Homer.

09:04.176 --> 09:05.871
He's wonderful.

09:11.517 --> 09:14.111
I'm trying to get a refund
for this ticket.

09:14.220 --> 09:16.381
Is this the executive office
of the ball club?

09:16.489 --> 09:20.585
- No. This is the equipment shed.
- Oh. Well, is that it?

09:20.693 --> 09:23.491
- That's where we keep the water heater.
- Is-

09:23.596 --> 09:26.224
- That's a tractor.
- I see.

09:26.332 --> 09:31.031
<i>Sir, we can't give your friend a refund</i>
<i>just because the team is losing.</i>

09:31.137 --> 09:34.504
I'm sorry to hear that!

09:34.607 --> 09:37.440
- Spin that back the way it was.
- Yes, sir.

09:37.543 --> 09:40.478
- This meeting is over.
- Okay.

09:40.580 --> 09:42.775
So, uh, you want to go
get something to eat?

09:42.882 --> 09:45.851
No, I don't. Get outta here.

09:45.952 --> 09:47.647
No, no! Not that door!

09:52.458 --> 09:55.894
"Albuquerque Isotopes"?

09:55.995 --> 09:58.896
- What is all this stuff?
- It's not anything.

09:58.998 --> 10:00.898
- Huh?
- It has no purpose.

10:03.035 --> 10:04.935
What a crazy room.

10:05.037 --> 10:08.495
There's no Albuquerque Isotopes.
It's the Springfield-

10:08.608 --> 10:10.974
- Oh.
- No, no. There's no "Oh."

10:11.077 --> 10:14.012
You're moving the team
to Albuquerque, aren't you?

10:14.113 --> 10:18.482
No. No. We would never abandon
our loyal Springfield fans.

10:18.584 --> 10:23.317
By the way, all this barging into rooms
marked "private" must have made you thirsty.

10:23.422 --> 10:25.447
- Would you like a beer?
- Well, okay.

10:25.558 --> 10:27.526
But you can't silence Homer Simpson!

10:27.627 --> 10:29.595
I'm the friend of the downtrodden...

10:29.695 --> 10:31.788
and I'm not gonna forget
what I saw here today.

10:31.897 --> 10:33.922
Of course not.

10:34.033 --> 10:38.026
Duffman, could you bring in two bottles
of smooth, untainted Duff?

10:38.137 --> 10:40.037
Oh, yeah!

10:40.139 --> 10:42.869
<i>#Oh, yeah #</i>

10:42.975 --> 10:45.239
Now, Homer,
we've developed this additive...

10:45.344 --> 10:48.370
that makes beer super, super malty.

10:48.481 --> 10:50.449
- Care to try it?
- Wait a minute.

10:50.549 --> 10:54.178
- Will this erase my memory?
- No. Not at all.

10:55.488 --> 10:57.183
Ma-

11:00.326 --> 11:02.226
Man, that is malty.

11:02.328 --> 11:05.092
But he'll never know!

11:10.670 --> 11:14.162
- Good grief.
- Oh! My head!

11:14.273 --> 11:16.241
How long have I been out here?

11:16.342 --> 11:19.209
- All night. You were yelling at the swing.
- I was?

11:19.311 --> 11:21.279
But I love the swing.

11:21.380 --> 11:24.110
- Dad, you were nuts.
- You know me.

11:24.216 --> 11:27.276
Occasionally, I'll be quirky.

11:27.386 --> 11:29.946
"I'll be quirky"?
Albuquerque!

11:30.056 --> 11:32.081
I'll be right back!

11:33.826 --> 11:35.817
<i>Members of the media,</i>
<i>thank you for coming.</i>

11:35.928 --> 11:40.797
The proof that the Isotopes are moving
to Albuquerque is right behind this door.

11:40.900 --> 11:44.199
Excuse me.
Joel Duffman, <i>The Newsly Times.</i>

11:44.303 --> 11:47.864
What's with the smear campaign
against this beloved brewer?

11:48.974 --> 11:51.704
And weren't you once in a loony bin?

11:51.811 --> 11:53.711
Oh, yeah!

11:53.813 --> 11:59.046
He's right, folks. The only story here
is the rich, smooth taste of Duff.

11:59.151 --> 12:02.518
Yes, that is an important story,
but so is this!

12:02.621 --> 12:04.885
It-

12:06.325 --> 12:08.589
Well, I think I know
tomorrow's headline:

12:08.694 --> 12:10.662
"Local Man is Liar."

12:10.763 --> 12:13.527
That is a good headline!

12:15.601 --> 12:17.728
So let me get this straight, Mr. Duff.

12:17.837 --> 12:20.362
The Isotopes are <i>not</i>
moving to Albuquerque?

12:20.473 --> 12:24.910
- Absolutely not.
- So are you calling Homer Simpson a liar?

12:25.010 --> 12:28.707
Well, we have obtained this footage
of him with his pants on fire.

12:31.684 --> 12:35.643
Well, Homie, I believe you're
telling the truth about the Isotopes.

12:35.755 --> 12:38.349
I don't mind being called a liar
when I'm lying...

12:38.457 --> 12:41.483
or about to lie,
or just finished lying.

12:41.594 --> 12:45.655
But not when I'm telling the truth!

12:45.765 --> 12:50.395
- Yeah. But what can you do?
- There's all kinds of ways to
get the public on your side.

12:50.503 --> 12:54.633
Bob Dylan wrote songs.
Cesar Chavez staged hunger strikes.

12:54.740 --> 12:57.766
That's it!
I'll go on a hunger strike!

12:57.877 --> 13:01.244
Homie, you couldn't keep up a hunger strike.

13:01.347 --> 13:03.281
You eat while you brush your teeth.

13:03.382 --> 13:05.407
You're eating a huge sausage right now.

13:06.752 --> 13:08.913
So? I can stop.

13:09.021 --> 13:10.921
And I will stop.

13:11.023 --> 13:14.083
I'm on a hunger strike starting right...

13:14.193 --> 13:16.286
now!

13:21.801 --> 13:24.599
Mmm!

13:24.703 --> 13:28.332
Mmm.

13:36.615 --> 13:39.413
Let's see those double-A
baseball honchos ignore this.

13:39.518 --> 13:41.486
You're really not gonna eat anything?

13:41.587 --> 13:46.047
My hunger strike will not end until Duff
admits they're moving the team!

13:46.158 --> 13:48.786
Bart, my chains.

13:48.894 --> 13:51.488
Mm-hmm. Hmm. Hmm.

13:51.597 --> 13:54.566
- Now it begins.
- Dad, I'm so proud of you.

13:54.667 --> 13:59.036
If you need some inspiration,
here's a book of Mike Farrell's core beliefs.

14:00.439 --> 14:05.206
Man, he really hates Wayne Rogers.

14:05.311 --> 14:07.871
Mmm! Good-bye, Homie.

14:07.980 --> 14:10.676
Here's Dr. Hibbert's number
if you feel weak.

14:10.783 --> 14:14.776
Don't worry. Duff s not gonna
let me waste away to nothing.

14:14.887 --> 14:16.787
<i>Uh, Dad.</i>

14:17.990 --> 14:19.514
Oh!

14:21.594 --> 14:23.994
What a great ball game.
Thanks, Weekend Dad.

14:24.096 --> 14:26.064
Stop calling me that.

14:26.165 --> 14:29.931
Hey, kid and man.
Don't support a team run by liars.

14:30.035 --> 14:33.471
- Liars?
- They're secretly planning
to move to Albuquerque.

14:33.572 --> 14:35.472
That's crazy.

14:35.574 --> 14:37.769
It would've been on a talk radio show
like <i>Sports Chat...</i>

14:37.877 --> 14:40.038
or <i>Sportzilla and theJabberJocks!</i>

14:40.145 --> 14:43.012
- Yeah!
- Why, you little-

14:45.417 --> 14:48.011
Oh, so hungry.

14:48.120 --> 14:51.886
Can't give up.
Must continue fighting evil corporation.

14:53.225 --> 14:56.592
Oh, Seymour, you shouldn't have.

14:56.695 --> 14:58.663
It's gonna go straight to my thighs.

14:58.764 --> 15:00.994
Well, Edna, it just might have
some company!

15:01.100 --> 15:04.035
Oh, Seymour!

15:06.105 --> 15:09.336
What? Nice try, God.

15:09.441 --> 15:13.502
But Homer Simpson
doesn't give into temptation that easily.

15:13.612 --> 15:16.012
Hey!

15:16.115 --> 15:17.480
Stop that!

15:20.886 --> 15:22.911
Ahh!

15:23.022 --> 15:24.990
There's still more meat loaf.

15:25.090 --> 15:26.990
Oh, that's impossible.

15:27.092 --> 15:30.391
Come on. Come on. We all have to
pitch in and eat your father's share.

15:30.496 --> 15:32.964
Why don't you just cook less?

15:33.065 --> 15:35.192
I don't do things that way, Lisa.

15:35.301 --> 15:38.862
# Dancing away my hunger pangs #

15:38.971 --> 15:42.463
# Moving my feet
so my stomach won't hurt #

15:42.574 --> 15:44.872
# I'm kinda likeJesus #

15:44.977 --> 15:48.504
# But not in a sacrilegious way ##

15:48.614 --> 15:50.741
Geez. Homer's losing it already.

15:50.849 --> 15:53.818
Yeah, but his weary shuffling
makes my heart smile.

15:56.422 --> 15:58.890
I'm so hungry!

15:58.991 --> 16:02.051
His tummy sounds angry, Daddy.

16:02.161 --> 16:04.254
Yeah. That's his stomach eating itself.

16:04.363 --> 16:08.732
It's such a beautiful day. Where are the crowds?

16:08.834 --> 16:12.099
Duffman is thrusting
in the direction of the problem.

16:14.506 --> 16:18.840
Hmm. People seem to
be drawn to that kook.

16:18.944 --> 16:20.571
Maybe we can exploit him.

16:20.679 --> 16:23.307
No, it's too dangerous, sir.
He knows about Albuquerque.

16:23.415 --> 16:25.508
Duffman is a cautious cat!

16:25.617 --> 16:28.245
No, listen. Fans love wackos.

16:28.354 --> 16:30.845
Remember that busty woman
who ran out on the field...

16:30.956 --> 16:33.481
and farted at the ballplayers?

16:33.592 --> 16:36.288
- Huh?
- I think we've found our newest attraction.

16:36.395 --> 16:39.489
Duffman has a bad feeling about this.

16:39.598 --> 16:41.930
- Can it, Sid.
- Why don't you can it, Howard?

16:54.446 --> 16:56.971
Huh? Wha-What's going on?

16:57.082 --> 17:00.347
- What am I doing here?
- Order of Mr. Duff, and word to the wise.

17:00.452 --> 17:03.580
If someone hits a home run,
the fireworks come out here and here.

17:05.758 --> 17:08.954
Gotta go!

17:11.096 --> 17:13.929
<i>Folks, it's time to meet a real super fan...</i>

17:14.032 --> 17:16.694
<i>Hungry Hungry Homer!</i>

17:16.801 --> 17:20.795
<i>He's on a hunger strike</i>
<i>till the 'Topes win the pennant!</i>

17:22.641 --> 17:24.905
What? That's not why I'm here!

17:25.010 --> 17:28.275
They're moving the team to Albuquerque!

17:28.380 --> 17:32.146
Hear that, folks?
He said, "Go, 'Topes!"

17:33.886 --> 17:36.650
Oh! All this hunger for nothing!

17:36.755 --> 17:39.121
Get your hot dogs!
Fat, juicy hot dogs!

17:39.224 --> 17:41.192
Pork chops and applesauce!

17:41.293 --> 17:44.421
Peking duck!
Get your crispy Peking duck!

17:44.530 --> 17:47.294
Yeah, duckman! Over here!

17:47.399 --> 17:50.493
Mmm! Mmm!

17:55.507 --> 17:57.372
Do they have to chew so loud?

17:59.078 --> 18:01.945
Oh. I'm wasting away.

18:02.047 --> 18:04.515
I'm down to a "B" cup!

18:04.616 --> 18:08.712
It's been a whole week!
Why are you letting my husband die?

18:08.821 --> 18:10.914
What does that have to do with baseball?

18:11.023 --> 18:13.787
- Death is a part of baseball.
- Oh, yeah. The main part.

18:13.892 --> 18:15.792
Guys!

18:15.894 --> 18:19.557
Uh, we won't let any harm come to
your husband, Mrs. Simpson. He'll be fine.

18:19.665 --> 18:22.725
He's not moving.

18:22.835 --> 18:26.566
He's probably resting from all the moving
he did before you got here.

18:26.672 --> 18:29.106
He'll start moving in a second.
I'm sure of it.

18:29.208 --> 18:34.145
Turn on the sprinklers.

18:34.246 --> 18:37.613
- You see there? He's fine.
- Ooh, look at him go.

18:41.053 --> 18:43.453
Oh, I'm so hungry.

18:43.555 --> 18:47.491
Oh, why keep starving myself?
No one cares.

18:47.593 --> 18:49.857
Hmm? Hmm.

18:49.962 --> 18:52.863
Who are you?

18:52.965 --> 18:54.899
The spirit of Cesar Chavez.

18:55.000 --> 18:56.968
Why do you look like Cesar Romero?

18:57.069 --> 18:59.162
Because you don't know
what Cesar Chavez looks like.

18:59.271 --> 19:02.434
- Why are you here?
- To tell you not to give up.

19:02.541 --> 19:04.133
Oh, but I wanna.

19:04.243 --> 19:06.211
He's talking to himself, sir.

19:06.311 --> 19:09.007
And his smell is distracting
the center fielder.

19:09.114 --> 19:11.912
Yeah. This is getting sad.
Let's bring him in.

19:12.017 --> 19:15.851
Okay, skinny. On your feet.

19:15.954 --> 19:19.219
What's happening?
Did I crush your corporation?

19:19.324 --> 19:21.952
No. You're being replaced.

19:24.129 --> 19:27.565
And now, taking over
for Hungry Hungry Homer...

19:27.666 --> 19:30.999
<i>let's welcome Paint-drinking Pete!</i>

19:40.379 --> 19:45.112
Well, Homer, your hunger strike
lasted 12 amazing days.

19:45.217 --> 19:47.412
Oh. Me so "hungy."

19:47.519 --> 19:50.386
Of course you are,
Hungry Hungry Homer.

19:50.489 --> 19:55.153
So why not break your fast with
our brand-new Isotope Dog Supreme?

19:55.260 --> 19:57.660
Oh, oh!

19:57.763 --> 20:00.027
So hard to resist.

20:00.132 --> 20:02.430
<i>Mesquite-grilled onions...</i>

20:02.534 --> 20:04.900
jalapeño relish.

20:05.003 --> 20:08.530
Wait a minute.
Those are southwestern ingredients!

20:10.275 --> 20:13.676
Mango lime salsa?

20:13.779 --> 20:16.475
That's the kind of bold flavor
they enjoy in...

20:16.582 --> 20:19.016
Albuquerque!

20:19.117 --> 20:21.745
- He's right!
- Yeah!

20:21.853 --> 20:25.186
- And the wrapper says "Albuquerque Isotopes"!
- Homer was right!

20:25.290 --> 20:27.690
They're planning to move the team!

20:29.761 --> 20:32.423
Now, now, now, now, see here, people.
Let's not be too hasty.

20:32.531 --> 20:34.499
Tell the truth!
Come on, everybody!

20:34.600 --> 20:37.296
Tell the truth! Tell the truth!

20:37.402 --> 20:39.768
- Get him out of here!
- Tell the truth! Tell the truth!

20:39.871 --> 20:44.399
Don't listen to him, Duffman. For once
in your life, stand up for the little guy.

20:46.745 --> 20:49.009
New feelings brewing in Duffman!

20:49.114 --> 20:51.742
What... would Jesus do?

20:51.850 --> 20:54.944
Hey! Hey! Hey! Whoa, whoa!

20:55.053 --> 20:57.886
Whoa!

20:57.990 --> 20:59.890
Oh, yeah!

20:59.992 --> 21:02.961
Yea!

21:03.061 --> 21:05.962
Eat, eat, eat! Eat, eat, eat!

21:06.064 --> 21:08.362
- <i>Eat, eat!</i>
- Ahh.

21:08.467 --> 21:10.992
The truth never tasted so good!

21:12.971 --> 21:14.666
Way to go, slim!

21:22.047 --> 21:24.515
Damn!
That town's got too much spirit.

21:24.616 --> 21:27.312
Looks like we'll have to steal
some other baseball team.

21:27.419 --> 21:29.387
See what Dallas wants for the Cowboys.

21:29.488 --> 21:31.513
Uh, that's a football team, sir.

21:31.623 --> 21:33.921
They'll play what I tell 'em to play...

21:35.060 --> 21:38.689
for I am the mayor of Albuquerque!

22:25.110 --> 22:27.078
Shh!
