This is a little preparation
for next Sunday when Linda's here.

00:07.194 --> 00:09.494
Brad, sorry I didn't wrap
everything in bacon.

00:09.496 --> 00:10.829

00:16.169 --> 00:17.696
the only Fuller getting tail

00:17.697 --> 00:19.067
in this family would be the

00:19.092 --> 00:20.538

00:20.540 --> 00:22.007
Yeah, nickname's not really catching on,

00:22.009 --> 00:23.678
so stop trying, okay?

00:23.840 --> 00:26.277
But, uh, Tower of
Terror's got a great point.

00:26.279 --> 00:27.946
I don't want Linda to feel uncomfortable

00:27.948 --> 00:29.814
as the only plus-one, why
don't you two bring dates?

00:29.816 --> 00:32.150
You want us to bring first
dates to a family dinner?

00:32.152 --> 00:33.985
Although it wouldn't be the
weirdest first date I ever had.

00:33.987 --> 00:35.954
- Thank you, Holocaust museum.
- MARV: It's a challenge.

00:35.956 --> 00:37.789
Bring dates to the barbecue next Sunday.

00:37.791 --> 00:39.257
What about the receptionist at work?

00:39.259 --> 00:40.492
What's-her-name, that
you're obsessed with.

00:40.494 --> 00:42.027
Oh, I don't even... Oh, that girl.

00:42.029 --> 00:43.395
Uh, Clara, I think, is her name.

00:43.397 --> 00:44.496
No, I'm not obsessed with her.

00:44.498 --> 00:45.797
I barely even mention her.

00:45.799 --> 00:46.898
“Dad, Clara's wearing glasses today.”

00:46.900 --> 00:48.633
“Dad, Clara's eating a bagel.”

00:48.635 --> 00:49.868
“Dad, Clara's choking.”

00:49.870 --> 00:51.770
- “Dad, Clara's fine.”

01:10.157 --> 01:11.823
It's getting traction.

01:11.825 --> 01:13.191
Like a runaway train, Marv.

01:13.193 --> 01:14.726
White coat on or off?

01:14.728 --> 01:16.761
Well, whenever I impersonate
a doctor, I leave it off.

01:16.763 --> 01:19.197
White coat makes it look like
you're trying too hard.

01:19.199 --> 01:22.033
Hugh has everything I look for.

01:22.035 --> 01:25.036
He's handsome, like an
untattooed David Beckham.

01:25.038 --> 01:26.538
He has an old earring hole,

01:26.540 --> 01:28.339
which means he was probably in a band,

01:28.341 --> 01:30.508
which means he was creative,
but then he made the choice

01:30.510 --> 01:32.510
to go into law, which
means he's also responsible.

01:32.512 --> 01:35.113
But it's environmental law,
so he's not smarter than me.

01:35.115 --> 01:38.349
Oh, you adorable OCD snowflake.

01:38.351 --> 01:41.052

weird 'cause he's my dad.

07:31.058 --> 07:33.458
Eugene, I'm happy to say that that mole,

07:33.460 --> 07:35.460
like all the others,
is completely normal.

07:35.462 --> 07:37.395
Are you sure? Because it
used to look like Kauai,

07:37.397 --> 07:39.531
but now I think it's
starting to look like Oahu.

07:39.533 --> 07:41.933
No, everything you're concerned
about is pretty straightforward.

07:41.935 --> 07:45.337
Not even sure why Walt referred
you to me, actually. Anyways,

07:45.339 --> 07:48.506
- go on, get out of here.
- Okay.

07:48.508 --> 07:51.209
Mandy, who's my 3:00?

07:51.211 --> 07:52.844
That'd be me again.

07:52.846 --> 07:54.212
I booked back-to-back appointments

07:54.214 --> 07:55.547
for my follow-up questions.

07:55.549 --> 07:57.949
Oh, I see why Walt referred you.

07:57.951 --> 07:59.584
Now, back on this
mole... I think it's changed

07:59.586 --> 08:01.152
since I've last seen
you. and I know that's

08:01.154 --> 08:02.821
a warning sign, so can
we take another look?

08:02.823 --> 08:04.723
Just a second.

08:04.725 --> 08:07.592
Mandy, any word from
my pregnant daughter?

08:07.594 --> 08:09.527
Has she gone into labor yet?

08:09.529 --> 08:10.929
Allison's not pregnant.

08:10.931 --> 08:12.497
Thank you, Mandy.

08:12.499 --> 08:15.066
Oh, that's the code word.

08:15.068 --> 08:16.534
Marv, your pregnant daughter

08:16.536 --> 08:18.303
Allison has gone into labor.

08:18.305 --> 08:20.272
I'll reschedule with whatever
problem patient you have

08:20.274 --> 08:21.573
at that time.

08:22.476 --> 08:24.242
Again, thank you, Mandy.

08:24.244 --> 08:26.177
Wow.

08:26.179 --> 08:27.846
That is a real talent.

08:27.848 --> 08:29.281
You're a peanut catcher. Wow, you just

08:29.283 --> 08:30.548
keep getting better and better.

08:30.550 --> 08:32.150
Hey, look who decided to show up.

08:32.152 --> 08:34.152
Ladies, this is my friend Phillip.

08:34.154 --> 08:36.388
Sorry for being late.
Pinterest rabbit hole.

08:36.390 --> 08:38.256
- Hey, Phil.
- It's Phillip.

08:38.258 --> 08:40.058
You know, I got to tell
you, Phil, you're not exactly

08:40.059 --> 08:42.027
what I was expecting for
the friend of a handsome,

08:42.029 --> 08:43.528
well-built guy like Gavin.

08:43.530 --> 08:46.064
Well, you're certainly,
uh, missing the mark

08:46.066 --> 08:47.799
for what I was expecting by about

08:47.801 --> 08:49.701
12 years and one vest.

08:49.703 --> 08:52.904
It is loud in here.

08:52.906 --> 08:54.272
Well, we don't have to stay here.

08:54.274 --> 08:55.407
Hey how about your place, Gavin?

08:55.409 --> 08:56.875
Oh, no, we can't, 'cause

08:56.877 --> 08:58.643
uh, I-I don't want to wake up my mom.

08:58.645 --> 09:00.578
He lives with his mom.

09:00.580 --> 09:02.414
- Hey, you two.
- Hey.

09:02.416 --> 09:04.249
- Hey.
- This is my brother Brad.

09:04.251 --> 09:05.317
Ah, you must be Hugh.

09:05.319 --> 09:06.851
- Gavin...
- Gely excited

09:06.853 --> 09:09.020
about going out with my sister here.

09:09.022 --> 09:10.956
I-I'm here to see Clara, actually.

09:10.958 --> 09:12.357
- Really, you are?
- Yeah.

09:12.359 --> 09:13.692
I'm gonna go do that. I will see you

09:13.694 --> 09:15.694
- at the barbecue Sunday.
- Huh?

09:15.696 --> 09:17.062
Someday. See you at
the barbecue someday.

09:17.064 --> 09:18.663
Never heard that expression?

09:18.665 --> 09:20.832
It means, like, uh,
like, “I'll see you later”"

09:20.834 --> 09:22.200
It's, uh... uh, regional...

09:22.202 --> 09:24.336
- thing. Okay, I...
- Yeah, see you later.

09:24.338 --> 09:25.603
Let's all go back to my house.

09:25.605 --> 09:26.738
- Yeah.
- Okay.

09:26.740 --> 09:28.506
Which is why I'm studying

09:28.508 --> 09:30.842
to be a veterinary assistant at night.

09:30.844 --> 09:32.677
Oh, that's amaz... A noble calling.

09:32.679 --> 09:35.280
Yeah, man's best
friend's best friend's assistant.

09:35.282 --> 09:38.016
- Yeah, that's right.
- Oh... Yeah.

09:38.018 --> 09:39.684
So I was gonna ask you at the...

09:39.686 --> 09:41.353
I-I'll just ask you right now...

09:41.355 --> 09:43.188
don't know what you have
planned this weekend,

09:43.190 --> 09:44.789
but would you like to go to a barbecue?

09:44.791 --> 09:48.593
Here comes the wrecking
crew. What? Uh. Huh?

09:48.595 --> 09:50.962
Clara, what you are drinking?
'Cause I'm buying for you.

09:50.964 --> 09:52.797
Excuse me, I'm sorry. Can
you and I have a quick talk?

09:52.799 --> 09:54.666
- Huh?
- Thanks, dude.

09:54.668 --> 09:56.368
I don't know if you noticed,

09:56.370 --> 09:58.036
but, uh, I'm actually on a date.

09:58.038 --> 10:00.872
Listen, dude, I'm
recently divorced, demoted,

10:00.874 --> 10:04.075
looking to shore myself
up emotionally, okay?

10:04.077 --> 10:06.544
I need to silver-line
this day in a big way.

10:06.546 --> 10:08.747
Clara's the sale I gots to close.

10:08.749 --> 10:10.582
All right, A, I don't like
the way you're talking about her.

10:10.584 --> 10:12.417
She's a woman, not a
sale. And B, I'm pretty deep

10:12.419 --> 10:14.252
into escrow on this,
buddy. And now I don't like

10:14.254 --> 10:15.587
the way I'm talking about her.

10:15.589 --> 10:17.122
What can I get you
guys started out with?

10:17.124 --> 10:19.391
BOTH: Double rye
Manhattan with three cherries.

10:19.393 --> 10:21.159
That's my drink, bro.

10:21.161 --> 10:22.594
Well, you have excellent taste, brah.

10:22.596 --> 10:25.030
Yeah, I know I do, 'cause I have it.

10:27.167 --> 10:28.366
Here we are.

10:28.368 --> 10:30.402
This place is sweet.

10:30.404 --> 10:32.070
Thanks. Do you want the grand tour?

10:32.072 --> 10:33.671
Yeah, sure.

10:33.673 --> 10:35.240
Right on time.

10:35.242 --> 10:37.742
Designated bang-ees
separate themselves to the other room

10:37.744 --> 10:39.277
while the support
staff is banished here,

10:39.279 --> 10:40.912
to Couch Island.

10:40.914 --> 10:44.015
Hey, come on in the kitchen
with me for just a moment.

10:44.017 --> 10:46.151
Oh, you're strong!

10:46.153 --> 10:48.953
What the hell do you
think you're doing out there?

10:48.955 --> 10:50.755
Something I should've
done a long time ago.

10:50.757 --> 10:54.192
I am tired of being the guy
who talks to the best friend

10:54.194 --> 10:55.693
of the hot girl that
my good-looking buddy

10:55.695 --> 10:57.162
is making the sweet-sweet to.

10:57.164 --> 10:58.797
Oh, please, you knew what
you were getting into

10:58.799 --> 11:00.965
when you hitched your
sidecar to Gavin's hog.

11:00.967 --> 11:02.700
You're a wingman, dude.

11:02.702 --> 11:04.069
Start acting like one.

11:04.071 --> 11:05.270
Well, not tonight.

11:05.272 --> 11:06.404
I'm going home.

11:06.406 --> 11:07.639
And Gavin is driving me,

11:07.641 --> 11:10.241
because I have night blindness.

11:10.243 --> 11:12.110
Oh, you little bat-eyed freak.

11:12.112 --> 11:13.711
You've left me no choice.

11:13.713 --> 11:15.480
What are you doing? That's assault.

11:20.187 --> 11:24.222
Now, you're gonna go into the
little room in the garage,

11:24.224 --> 11:25.857
you're gonna get in the shower,

11:25.859 --> 11:27.659
and you're gonna shampoo that beard

11:27.661 --> 11:29.894
that reeks of your recessive genes.

11:29.896 --> 11:31.629
And you're gonna get out,

11:31.631 --> 11:33.832
and you're gonna put
on whatever accessories

11:33.834 --> 11:36.267
and/or enhancements are laid out for you

11:36.269 --> 11:38.436
and meet me at my bed,

11:38.438 --> 11:40.705
on your knees,

11:40.707 --> 11:43.441
'cause we're gonna get Roman tonight.

11:44.744 --> 11:46.244
Hey, Phil and I are gonna

11:46.246 --> 11:47.612
check out my bone collection.

11:47.614 --> 11:48.947
Then bone.

11:48.949 --> 11:51.449
Sorry, I was gonna spin it, then bailed.

11:51.451 --> 11:53.985
You okay, buddy?

11:53.987 --> 11:56.588
(phone chirps)

11:56.590 --> 11:58.089
It's a penis.

11:58.091 --> 12:00.358
There's a penis on your phone.

12:00.360 --> 12:01.926
I know that penis.

12:01.928 --> 12:03.661
- I'm intrigued.
- It's Eugene.

12:03.663 --> 12:05.330
Walt is pranking me,

12:05.332 --> 12:07.298
and he set me up with
this hypochondriac patient

12:07.300 --> 12:09.300
who's texting me his
every mole from everywhere.

12:09.302 --> 12:11.436
It's got to stop.

12:11.438 --> 12:12.837
It's time to retaliate.

12:12.839 --> 12:14.873
(gasps) Oh, a prank war?

12:14.875 --> 12:16.207
- Uh-huh.
- Oh.

12:16.209 --> 12:18.109
What if we bake him some cookies,

12:18.111 --> 12:20.111
but instead of sugar, (chuckles)

12:20.113 --> 12:21.913
we use salt.

12:21.915 --> 12:23.214
Okay.

12:23.216 --> 12:24.983
Or he's giving a speech

12:24.985 --> 12:26.951
at a dermatology conference.

12:26.953 --> 12:28.253
How embarrassing would it be

12:28.255 --> 12:30.355
if he had a huge rash on his face?

12:30.357 --> 12:32.924
You said you had a poison
oak problem in the yard.

12:32.926 --> 12:35.026
So you're gonna poison him?

12:35.028 --> 12:36.394
Linda.

12:36.396 --> 12:38.296
This is a dermatological prank war.

12:38.298 --> 12:41.633
Victory is all that matters.

12:42.636 --> 12:44.736
So, what did you do for a living

12:44.738 --> 12:47.005
before you stopped doing it?

12:47.007 --> 12:49.007
Um, I'm an architect.

12:49.009 --> 12:50.708
I, uh, I have my own firm.

12:50.710 --> 12:52.210
Really?

12:52.212 --> 12:53.912
You said you were between jobs.

12:53.914 --> 12:56.514
Oh, yeah, well, I'm turning
a lot of stuff down lately

12:56.516 --> 12:57.649
to help my mom.

12:57.651 --> 12:58.716
She had hip surgery,

12:58.718 --> 13:00.385
so I moved her into my house.

13:00.387 --> 13:01.920
Wow.

13:01.922 --> 13:04.122
That's (chuckles) that's really sweet.

13:04.124 --> 13:05.356
Yeah, that's actually, um,

13:05.358 --> 13:06.824
what this tattoo means.

13:06.826 --> 13:08.359
“Protector of elders.”

13:08.361 --> 13:09.360
Really?

13:09.362 --> 13:11.429
No. (chuckles) I lost a bet.

13:11.431 --> 13:13.531
Oh, well, what would you
have gotten if you'd won?

13:13.533 --> 13:14.666
Punched in the balls.

13:14.668 --> 13:15.867
It was a fraternity thing.

13:15.869 --> 13:17.335
Oh.

13:17.337 --> 13:18.403
Are you okay? You just...

13:18.405 --> 13:19.504
You look a little flushed.

13:19.506 --> 13:20.705
Yeah, yeah.

13:20.707 --> 13:23.141
I just, uh, I got a little nervous.

13:23.143 --> 13:25.109
Oh, why would you be nervous?

13:25.111 --> 13:27.345
Because you're actually a great guy.

13:27.347 --> 13:30.081
You seem like you're just realizing that.

13:30.083 --> 13:32.183
Okay, this is gonna start
out sounding slightly...

13:32.185 --> 13:33.718
totally... harsh,

13:33.720 --> 13:35.687
but it's going to end

13:35.689 --> 13:36.788
in a huge compliment, okay?

13:36.790 --> 13:37.855
- All right.
- So just hang in there.

13:37.857 --> 13:39.190
All right, so, um,

13:39.192 --> 13:40.625
there was this one, like,

13:40.627 --> 13:42.193
really, really, really,
really, really hot guy

13:42.195 --> 13:43.928
that I wanted to ask out, but, um,

13:43.930 --> 13:46.664
I was too nervous, so
I needed a practice guy.

13:46.666 --> 13:48.499
You know, someone
I wouldn't care about.

13:48.501 --> 13:50.134
And based on first impressions,

13:50.136 --> 13:53.171
you seemed like the
perfect practice guy.

13:53.173 --> 13:55.506
What I discovered was that underneath

13:55.508 --> 13:57.041
that horrendous tattoo...

13:57.043 --> 13:58.142
Okay, I'm not really interested

13:58.144 --> 13:59.711
in what you discovered.

13:59.713 --> 14:03.214
Um, I don't want to be
someone's practice guy.

14:03.216 --> 14:04.482
Oh, no.

14:04.484 --> 14:06.184
Oh, that's not

14:06.186 --> 14:07.619
how that was... Okay.

14:07.621 --> 14:08.953
So I guess we should just say,

14:08.955 --> 14:10.622
“I'll see you at a barbecue someday.”

14:14.194 --> 14:15.560
That's not a thing!

14:15.562 --> 14:17.462
I like you!

14:17.464 --> 14:18.830
(groans)

14:23.629 --> 14:26.029
Tell me everything
about Amy. I'm in love.

14:26.031 --> 14:28.365
Blink once if you're
saying this under duress.

14:28.367 --> 14:29.700
Hey!

14:29.702 --> 14:32.302
There's my chubby little lumberjack.

14:32.304 --> 14:34.404
Come on, pal, you need to
get off my property right now.

14:34.406 --> 14:35.873
My property.

14:35.875 --> 14:37.141
When can I see you again?

14:37.143 --> 14:38.709
Well, I play for the New York Liberty,

14:38.711 --> 14:39.416
and training camp starts

14:39.441 --> 14:40.914
- tomorrow.
- Take my number.

14:41.067 --> 14:42.012
- I don't need that.
- Just think about it.

14:42.014 --> 14:43.881
Just did.

14:45.384 --> 14:47.084
What did you do to that boy?

14:47.086 --> 14:48.318
I angel-kissed him.

14:48.320 --> 14:50.254
- I'm sorry. What?
- I angel-kissed him.

14:50.256 --> 14:51.590
It's like a French kiss,

14:51.591 --> 14:54.424
but the tongue goes all the
way to the base of the brain.

14:54.426 --> 14:57.161
And if you hit it
just right, it's amazing.

14:57.163 --> 15:00.097
But if you miss it, the best you
can hope for is a quick death.

15:00.099 --> 15:01.665
- Medically impossible.
- Mm.

15:01.667 --> 15:04.101
But that means you can bring
Hugh to the barbecue,

15:04.103 --> 15:06.703
'cause you slept with Gavin
and got out all your jitters.

15:06.705 --> 15:09.273
- Yeah, about that.
- What did you not do last night?

15:09.275 --> 15:12.042
I blew it with Gavin, who's
actually really great.

15:12.044 --> 15:13.210
And, unfortunately, now he
thinks I'm really shallow

15:13.212 --> 15:15.045
and he wants nothing to do with me.

15:15.047 --> 15:18.081
Ugh. I knew you didn't have
it in you to have it in you,

15:18.083 --> 15:19.516
but, hey, it's okay. Don't worry.

15:19.518 --> 15:20.984
I still think you're ready for Hugh.

15:20.986 --> 15:22.319
But I want to see Gavin again.

15:22.321 --> 15:23.787
Turns out he's not the practice guy.

15:23.789 --> 15:25.289
He's the guy I've been practicing for.

15:25.291 --> 15:27.342
If only we knew someone

15:27.447 --> 15:29.141
who knew someone who had his number.

15:29.142 --> 15:31.161
Hey, you want some
breakfast? I'm thinking frosting.

15:31.163 --> 15:32.329
I mean, 'cause it just seems like

15:32.331 --> 15:33.463
if I did have a guardian angel...

15:33.465 --> 15:34.398
That's me.

15:34.400 --> 15:36.600
And you were said guardian angel...

15:36.602 --> 15:38.735
- Oh, it's a trap.
- The least you could do

15:38.737 --> 15:40.237
is make one little phone call,

15:40.239 --> 15:41.905
even if it meant you
had to see Phillip again.

15:41.907 --> 15:44.441
Oh, Allison.

15:44.443 --> 15:47.110
Honey, I have to
confess something to you.

15:47.112 --> 15:49.813
I'm just a crazy lady.

15:51.116 --> 15:52.783
I'm not your guardian... I can't do it.

15:52.785 --> 15:55.452
Can't do it. No.
I... I'll call Phil. Shoot!

15:55.454 --> 15:57.387
Where's his number?

15:57.612 --> 16:00.724
- (elevator bell dings)
- Marv.

16:00.726 --> 16:02.860
Walt. Hey, how's your new patient?

16:02.862 --> 16:04.962
Hope you don't mind.
Told him you do house calls.

16:04.964 --> 16:06.050
(laughing): Oh, you

16:06.075 --> 16:07.364
- got me good.
- (laughs)

16:07.366 --> 16:09.733
Hey, listen, uh, good
luck with the speech tonight.

16:09.735 --> 16:11.235
- Oh.
- MARV: Really.

16:11.237 --> 16:12.903
WALT: Why, thank you. Much appreciated.

16:12.905 --> 16:14.671
- MARV: Hope you kill it.
- Hmm.

16:14.673 --> 16:17.441
You got a little something
on your cheek, by the way.

16:17.443 --> 16:19.109
Okay. Other side.

16:19.111 --> 16:20.777
- Other? Here?
- Yeah, yeah, a little higher.

16:20.779 --> 16:22.212
Uh, did I get it?

16:22.214 --> 16:25.015
Oh, there's no doubt that you got it.

16:25.017 --> 16:27.451
That's an odd way to
phrase it, but thank you.

16:27.453 --> 16:29.286
- (elevator bell dings)
- Yup. This is you.

16:29.288 --> 16:30.687
Yup. I'll see you Sunday.

16:30.689 --> 16:33.257
All righty.

16:34.493 --> 16:36.560
So here we are, back where it began

16:36.562 --> 16:39.229
- for us so many hours ago.
- Yeah, there's no us.

16:39.231 --> 16:41.865
Uh, listen, all I want
is Gavin's information.

16:41.867 --> 16:44.067
And if your foot touches
me one more time,

16:44.069 --> 16:46.136
I'm gonna snap it off at the ankle.

16:46.138 --> 16:48.472
I'm sorry, I wish I could help,

16:48.474 --> 16:50.507
but Allison really insulted Gavin.

16:50.509 --> 16:52.209
He never wants to see her ever again.

16:52.211 --> 16:54.077
I hear you.

16:54.079 --> 16:57.080
Allow me to counter...

16:57.082 --> 17:00.884
with my scent.

17:00.886 --> 17:02.386
(sniffing)

17:02.388 --> 17:04.387
Mi amor.

17:08.493 --> 17:10.493
So anyways, I'm thinking, Sunday night,

17:10.496 --> 17:12.496
you and me kicking it on my boat?

17:12.498 --> 17:14.531
Oh. I thought the boat got repossessed.

17:14.532 --> 17:16.867
- That's not till Monday, man.
- Can I talk to you for a second?

17:16.868 --> 17:18.335
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Thank you.

17:18.337 --> 17:20.137
Maybe you didn't hear me last night

17:20.138 --> 17:22.673
with the three cherries in
my mouth, but back off.

17:22.675 --> 17:24.775
Easy, bro. I wrestled in high school.

17:24.777 --> 17:26.944
I wrestled myself.
What weight class were you?

17:26.945 --> 17:29.446
- 106. Late bloomer.
- Heard that. I bloomed super late.

17:29.448 --> 17:31.448
- Nice stance, by the way.
- Thanks.

17:31.450 --> 17:33.016
Stance is where the power comes from.

17:33.018 --> 17:34.484
(grunts) Sweet escape just now.

17:34.486 --> 17:35.886
They called me Teeny Houdini.

17:35.888 --> 17:37.087
Okay, you guys, just stop.

17:37.089 --> 17:39.523
This is ridiculous

17:39.525 --> 17:41.992
and weird. I don't
want to date either of you.

17:41.994 --> 17:42.669
- What?
- Huh?

17:42.694 --> 17:43.527
So, I'm just

17:43.529 --> 17:45.729
gonna scoot on down to
H.R., get this all on record,

17:45.731 --> 17:47.764
and kindly ask you
both to keep your distance.

17:49.868 --> 17:52.302
I got to tell you, I'm 100% shocked

17:52.304 --> 17:53.937
that this peacocking didn't work.

17:53.939 --> 17:55.706
Don't sweat it. Quality
buck like yourself...

17:55.708 --> 17:57.674
you'll have a
reverse breakup in no time.

17:57.676 --> 17:59.509
Thanks, bro. Right back at you, dude.

17:59.511 --> 18:01.445
You deserve a true partner in life.

18:01.447 --> 18:04.247
One who walks besides
you, not in front or behind.

18:04.249 --> 18:05.916
Hey, man, I know you've
had a rough week.

18:05.918 --> 18:07.951
- Would a family barbecue cheer you up?
- You know what?

18:07.953 --> 18:09.686
I think it really might. Can
you pick me up, though?

18:09.688 --> 18:11.088
Because I lose the Lexus on Friday.

18:11.090 --> 18:14.157
- You know it.
- My man.

18:14.159 --> 18:16.493
(both grunting)

18:16.495 --> 18:18.195
- There's that escape.
- There it is.

18:18.197 --> 18:20.564
I really like you, man.

18:20.566 --> 18:21.999
You sure you don't
want my help with Gavin?

18:22.001 --> 18:23.433
I mean, I've angel-ed you this far.

18:23.435 --> 18:24.735
I'd kind of like to stick the landing.

18:24.737 --> 18:26.870
- Nope, I got it.
- Because you need

18:26.872 --> 18:28.672
a big gesture, you know?

18:28.674 --> 18:30.340
And I could whip up a children's choir

18:30.342 --> 18:33.510
or a flash mob or-or
maybe some sort of eclipse?

18:33.512 --> 18:35.345
Lunar? Solar? Mitsubishi?

18:35.347 --> 18:37.406
Here he is.

18:40.419 --> 18:42.819
What are you doing here?

18:42.821 --> 18:44.821
Don't blame Phillip.

18:44.823 --> 18:46.156
It was the only way I could get you here

18:46.158 --> 18:48.959
to apologize and buy
you a cup of coffee.

18:52.297 --> 18:54.331
Actually, I bought
you one of everything.

18:54.333 --> 18:56.433
Because I don't know what
kind of coffee you like,

18:56.435 --> 18:57.968
and I didn't want to assume anything

18:57.970 --> 19:00.170
about you like I did yesterday.

19:05.577 --> 19:07.477
This is a sweet and wasteful gesture.

19:07.479 --> 19:10.147
It was wrong of me to assume I knew you

19:10.149 --> 19:12.649
based on the short amount
of time we spent together.

19:12.651 --> 19:15.719
And I'm just really
hoping that you won't judge me

19:15.721 --> 19:18.655
based on that same short amount of time.

19:18.657 --> 19:21.992
Hi. I'm Gavin.

19:21.994 --> 19:25.162
I'm an architect, and
my mom lives with me.

19:25.164 --> 19:27.531
Hi, I'm Allison. I'm a dermatologist,

19:27.533 --> 19:29.733
and I can remove that tattoo for you.

19:29.735 --> 19:31.134

19:34.540 --> 19:37.774

Too on the nose.

19:39.578 --> 19:41.178
Shut it down. Are you sure?

19:41.180 --> 19:43.180
Because a power ballad feels right.

19:43.182 --> 19:45.348
No? Okay. All right,
kids, that's a wrap.

19:45.350 --> 19:47.651
Now, you don't have to go
home, but you can't stay here. Out.

19:47.653 --> 19:50.353
Let's go.

19:50.355 --> 19:52.689
You want to go to a barbecue Sunday?

19:53.926 --> 19:56.393
Oh, okay. See you later.

19:56.395 --> 19:59.162
No. No, no, no. No, do you actually want

19:59.164 --> 20:01.698
to go to a barbecue with me this Sunday?

20:01.700 --> 20:03.867
Oh. Oh-oh, yeah, yeah,
yeah, that'd be great.

20:10.930 --> 20:13.149
Thanks for coming. Glad
you could make it.

20:13.712 --> 20:16.179
All right. Who else is here? Walt!

20:16.181 --> 20:17.814
Hey.

20:17.816 --> 20:20.350
How'd the speech go? Was
it a break-out performance?

20:20.352 --> 20:22.252
Well, I didn't make it to the speech.

20:22.254 --> 20:23.786
I was rushed to the hospital.

20:23.788 --> 20:26.389
- What?
- My eyes were totally swollen shut.

20:26.391 --> 20:28.524
I looked like Rango.

20:28.526 --> 20:32.262
Gotcha?

20:32.264 --> 20:34.564
Big time. (chuckles)

20:34.566 --> 20:36.566
Derma prank war respect, sir.

20:36.568 --> 20:40.003
Aha. See? Just good fun.
