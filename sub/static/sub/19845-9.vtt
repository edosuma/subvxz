No, that's a smudge-mark thing. Dude,

01:25.269 --> 01:26.947

- You're not wearing

01:26.971 --> 01:28.482

fucking Eddie Murphy in

01:41.852 --> 01:44.486
All right, that's cool too.
I fucking love Eddie Murphy.

01:44.531 --> 01:46.390

- Yeah, so do I. He's the greatest.

01:46.414 --> 01:48.016

01:53.629 --> 01:55.295
You felt it. You felt it, right?
You know

01:55.307 --> 01:56.864
why you can't do that. I know, I know.

01:56.899 --> 01:59.500
I gotta admit, seeing
you gesture with arms

01:59.535 --> 02:01.034
is making me a little jealous.

02:01.069 --> 02:02.669
- Like this?
- Oh!

02:02.705 --> 02:04.505
- Hmm?

02:16.684 --> 02:18.161
I need to go to a wedding or something.

02:18.185 --> 02:20.386

02:20.422 --> 02:23.055
- and just go like this.
- You look good in that jacket.

02:23.090 --> 02:24.567
- Thank you.
- See, now we're gonna go on the date,

02:24.591 --> 02:25.889
and I'm gonna be this, and they're

02:25.901 --> 02:27.404
gonna think I'm freaking milquetoast.

02:27.428 --> 02:29.006
I gotta be honest, you
look a little boring.

02:29.030 --> 02:30.172
All right. I gotta do something.

02:30.196 --> 02:31.508
- I gotta...
- What do you think if we go

02:31.532 --> 02:34.098
into a movie outfit-changing
montage scene real quick?

02:34.134 --> 02:35.743
Can I try on a bunch
of different outfits?

02:35.767 --> 02:36.735
That sounds great.

02:36.770 --> 02:38.403
- Here we go!
- (shouts)

02:39.227 --> 02:39.975
Tadah!

02:40.019 --> 02:41.878
It's a straw. I just taped
it around my waist.

02:41.903 --> 02:42.709
Dude, that's it.

02:42.734 --> 02:44.064
- That's fucking it. I'm serious.
- Are sure?

02:44.088 --> 02:46.257
- 'Cause I got three or four other ones
- No.

02:46.282 --> 02:47.835
it's like real funny, kind
of character-based stuff.

02:47.859 --> 02:49.558
Forget those. The two-arm
thing right here?

02:49.593 --> 02:51.258
- This is the one.
- They're actually pretty pliable.

02:51.282 --> 02:53.171
- Yeah!

02:53.196 --> 02:55.117

02:55.142 --> 02:57.485

03:08.999 --> 03:10.799

03:10.834 --> 03:12.773
That was honestly just instinct.
(coughs)

03:12.798 --> 03:14.368
- It looks good.
- It feels right.

03:14.404 --> 03:15.714
It fucking makes sense.
It feels real.

03:15.738 --> 03:17.537

03:17.573 --> 03:19.506
I think this date is
gonna be one of our best,

03:21.935 --> 03:24.359
could possibly turn down either of us.

Hey, put 'er there.

03:26.481 --> 03:28.415
Ooh, this feels good, too. (laughs)

03:28.450 --> 03:30.250
- (laughs)
- Holy shit.

03:30.285 --> 03:31.060
I trust you.

03:31.085 --> 03:33.385
It's kinda like we're
saying to each other,

03:33.421 --> 03:35.354
"I'm not a jerk. You're not a jerk.

03:35.389 --> 03:37.857
There's no jerks here.
Jerks on, jerks off."

03:37.892 --> 03:40.093
- Jerks off, okay? Right.
- Jerks off. Let's jerk off.

03:40.128 --> 03:41.505
- That's right. Jerking off.
- Jerking off.

Oh shit. Shit, shit, shit.

- Hi. Hi.

04:09.110 --> 04:11.588
Am I in the right place? Is this life?

04:11.734 --> 04:15.179
Yes! Sorry, I, uh, I wasn't
expecting you to arrive this early.

04:15.204 --> 04:17.628
Oh, no. I think I am
actually the early one,

04:17.663 --> 04:19.601
so don't worry about it. Are you, um...

04:19.648 --> 04:21.958
- Mom. I'm your mom.
- Mom.

04:22.024 --> 04:24.015
- Yeah, I was gonna say, "Mom."

04:24.078 --> 04:26.127

- Yeah.

04:26.152 --> 04:28.443

a kinship towards you,

04:28.468 --> 04:29.992

04:30.017 --> 04:32.541

care of me, so that's cool.

04:32.577 --> 04:37.080
So, this is the nest, and I've
expanded it just for your arrival.

04:37.115 --> 04:39.916
This is really nice. What is
that, a piece of popcorn?

04:39.951 --> 04:43.968
The popcorn chair! Not saying
whose backyard it came from.

04:44.078 --> 04:46.454
- (whispers) Steve Buscemi.
- Wow!

04:46.490 --> 04:49.158
I'm gonna like life. I can tell.
I'm gonna really like this.

04:49.460 --> 04:51.260
- Hey, Mom?
- Uh-huh.

04:51.295 --> 04:54.062
I have this bubble in my
stomach, but it's empty.

04:54.098 --> 04:56.298
It's like a gurgling.
It doesn't feel great.

04:56.333 --> 04:58.432
Oh! Of course you're hungry.
Just give me a second.

04:58.467 --> 05:00.789
- Okay.
- Trying to get a little saliva going.

05:00.814 --> 05:02.507
Okay, now here, you've just gotta

05:02.519 --> 05:04.482
sorta tilt your head back like that.

05:04.507 --> 05:07.484
- All right, now open wide.
- Here we go. Okay.

05:07.677 --> 05:09.844
- (grunts, coughs)
- Whoa! Oh God.

05:09.879 --> 05:12.320
- (straining)
- What? Ah! Please don't.

05:12.705 --> 05:14.726
- What?
- (coughs) Oh fuck.

05:14.851 --> 05:17.250
- I got nothing.
- That really scared me.

05:17.286 --> 05:20.086
You know what? It's mommy's fault.
I should've stocked up.

05:20.122 --> 05:22.856
I'm just gonna have to run out
and grab us a little food.

05:22.891 --> 05:25.148
So, you stay here... Oh shit!

05:25.250 --> 05:27.148
- We didn't name you yet.
- Oh!

05:27.173 --> 05:29.362
Do you want to pick your name?

05:29.397 --> 05:31.264
- Like a forever name?
- Yeah.

05:31.300 --> 05:32.784
- This is what people are gonna call me?
- Yeah.

05:32.808 --> 05:36.176
Okay. That's a lot of pressure.
Um, how about...

05:36.204 --> 05:38.570
Choo. Choo. Chewie-choo.

05:38.605 --> 05:40.806
- Chewie, choo.
- Choo, choo, choo! Choo, choo, choo!

05:40.842 --> 05:43.843
- Chooch? Okay. How about...
- Cho-choo-choo... choo-choo!

05:43.878 --> 05:45.195
Charly? How about Charly?

05:45.227 --> 05:47.127
- Yeah, Charly.
- Charly's a nice name.

05:47.162 --> 05:50.196
I love that. Mix it up.
Who are we? Famous birds?

05:50.231 --> 05:54.133
Okay, Charly, I'm gone, you're
the leader of the nest.

05:54.168 --> 05:57.704
So be safe and be brave, and I love you.

05:58.039 --> 06:00.921
Wow. Okay, that felt good.

06:00.968 --> 06:03.643
Mama bird taking off. Pew!

06:04.007 --> 06:07.212
Whoo! Flying fucking rules!

06:07.247 --> 06:09.328
Wow. I am immediately missing her.

Narrator: <i> But what little Choo...
Charly didn't know</i>

character does end up

06:23.963 --> 06:26.363
having to try the case.
You have to see it. Ooh!

06:26.398 --> 06:28.666
Here we go! Showtime!
This is where it gets fun.

06:28.701 --> 06:32.036
The mother bird has left the
nest, so I go take care of her.

06:32.071 --> 06:34.304
But while I'm doing that,
you're gonna sneak in

06:34.340 --> 06:35.597
and you're gonna take
care of the little one.

06:35.621 --> 06:36.573
- Matthew?
- (game beeping)

06:36.609 --> 06:39.510
- What are you... Matthew!
- Sorry, I wasn't listening.

06:39.545 --> 06:42.145
- Starting when?
- Starting whenever you talked, I guess.

06:42.180 --> 06:44.748
Oh. Okay, listen to me.
I'm trying to teach you

06:44.783 --> 06:46.349
how to become your own opossum.

06:46.384 --> 06:49.753
Oh my God. Can you stop saying
"opossum"? It's "possum," Dad.

06:49.788 --> 06:51.888
- It's not "possum." You say, "Opossum."
- It's...

06:51.923 --> 06:53.701
No, you say you're a possum!
It's a show of respect.

06:53.725 --> 06:56.425
Would you go to church and
say, "You're a preacher"?

06:56.461 --> 06:57.671
No, you say, "You're an o-preacher."

06:57.695 --> 06:59.995
(sighs) Dad, why can't we
just do it the normal way?

07:00.031 --> 07:02.297
You go out, something
happens, I don't know what,

07:02.332 --> 07:04.344
and then you come back, we
eat the food, and it's done.

07:04.368 --> 07:08.804
- Why screw up the status quo?
- If you teach an opossum to fish,

07:08.839 --> 07:11.940
you're wasting your time,
because we don't eat fish.

07:11.976 --> 07:13.675
Okay. (gasps) Isn't that an expression?

07:13.710 --> 07:15.154
- Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.
- (game beeping)

07:15.178 --> 07:18.680
Oh, got a suppa.
Yes! These are super rare.

07:18.715 --> 07:20.114
Okay, so we're gonna wrap it up.

07:20.150 --> 07:22.717
I'm gonna go take care
of the dinner sitch.

07:22.752 --> 07:25.419
Can you make sure to get that
extra marinara on top of it?

07:25.454 --> 07:28.156
- What's the... the marinara?
- The marinara, the red sauce.

07:28.191 --> 07:31.191
Oh, the red s... the red sauce.
Okay, it's red sauce.

07:31.226 --> 07:33.293
(mutters) I've done a
horrible job with this boy.

- No, dude. What is that?

08:16.069 --> 08:17.379

It's the snakeskin jacket.

not wearing a goddamn wig, dude!

08:21.095 --> 08:22.359

that we wouldn't fuck this up!

08:25.290 --> 08:27.911
I'm not going back on the jerk off.
I'm just saying...

08:27.947 --> 08:30.225
This date with Laura and Daphne
has to go well, dude, okay?

08:30.249 --> 08:33.250
- Just don't fuck this up, man.
- Jesus. Why are you so nervous?

08:33.284 --> 08:35.585
We're freaking hermaphroditic anyway.
We can't have sex.

08:35.611 --> 08:36.657
I know we're hermaphroditic... It's

08:36.669 --> 08:37.846
not like it's gonna lead to anything.

08:37.870 --> 08:40.123
but it's just like,
"What about falling in love?"

08:40.158 --> 08:41.268
You know, that might be cool.

08:41.292 --> 08:44.313
Or even hanging out with someone
that's not each other.

08:45.063 --> 08:46.462
I only hang out with you,

08:46.642 --> 08:48.459
and frankly, I think you might be a

08:48.471 --> 08:50.666
figment of my fucking
imagination, okay?

08:50.701 --> 08:53.236
I'm losing my mind
under this goddamn rock.

08:53.454 --> 08:56.374
Did you just say I might be a
figment of your imagination?

08:56.399 --> 08:58.840
No, dude. I... I don't...
it's just like something that...

08:58.876 --> 09:00.776
when I'm falling asleep
I'll think about it.

09:00.811 --> 09:03.178
Like the fact that you
and me are the same thing,

09:03.213 --> 09:07.182
like we're one worm, and why would
both ends of us be cognizant?

09:07.217 --> 09:08.742
And how would you even have a

09:08.767 --> 09:10.149
- different personality than me?
- (thuds)

09:10.173 --> 09:12.202
And sometimes I think I
can read your thoughts,

09:12.214 --> 09:14.255
and I feel like you're
just saying my thoughts,

09:14.290 --> 09:17.057
so it's... I don't fucking know,
but let's just go, Mike.

09:17.923 --> 09:19.860
Mike? Mike? (chuckles nervously)

09:19.896 --> 09:22.704
- (heart beating)
- Oh shit, dude.

09:23.079 --> 09:26.033
He fucking wasn't real,
and he fucking was... Mike!

09:26.068 --> 09:27.268
Oh fuck!

09:27.303 --> 09:30.336
Narrator: <i>And that's when
Phil knew he was alone,</i>

09:30.884 --> 09:33.472
<i>and that he'd always been alone,</i>

09:33.696 --> 09:37.510
<i>and he will always,
always, always be alone.</i>

09:37.545 --> 09:40.113
(laughs) I fucking "Fight
Clubbed" you, dude.

09:40.154 --> 09:42.387
- Dude! What the Fuck, Mike!
- Oh my God!

09:42.417 --> 09:44.750
- That's not fucking funny, dude!
- No, it's really funny.

09:44.786 --> 09:46.063
- You were about to cry.
- Oh God!

09:46.087 --> 09:48.198
Narrator: <i> Oh. Never mind.</i>
I think I'm gonna fucking barf!

09:48.222 --> 09:50.100
<i>Mike was just joking. Okay.</i>
What, are you being serious?

09:50.124 --> 09:53.658
- Oh my God, that was funny!
- Phil: Let's go. We're gonna be late.

09:55.806 --> 09:56.862
(wind blowing)

09:59.735 --> 10:01.040
(chirping)

10:01.268 --> 10:03.268
Come on, man! (spits)

10:03.304 --> 10:05.502
This was one of my best holes.

10:05.538 --> 10:07.638
It was amok with little bugs

10:07.673 --> 10:09.941
and little critters, and now, nothing.

10:10.259 --> 10:12.509
Narrator: <i>As the mother
bird searches for food,</i>

10:12.545 --> 10:15.779
<i>annoyingly, predator becomes prey.</i>

10:16.181 --> 10:17.532
- (bell tolls)
- <i>Damn!</i>

10:18.110 --> 10:20.718
I get it. This is why people
feed their kids garbage.

10:20.753 --> 10:22.243
- (growling)
- It's convenient.

10:24.251 --> 10:25.360
(hissing)

10:25.523 --> 10:26.656
Oh fuck.

10:26.691 --> 10:29.726
- (growling)
- All right, bring it!

10:30.126 --> 10:32.235
Square up, bitch. (shouts)

10:33.321 --> 10:35.665
- (video game noises)
- Oh, I love you, my little babushka.

10:35.700 --> 10:37.867
This hurts me more than it hurts you.

10:38.252 --> 10:39.259
(dad hissing, growling)

10:39.329 --> 10:40.848
Hey, Dad, can you keep
it down up there...

10:40.872 --> 10:43.196
down there, wherever you... Dad? (gasps)

10:43.335 --> 10:45.485
Die! Die!

10:45.609 --> 10:47.343
Dad! What are you doing? Stop!

10:47.378 --> 10:50.512
Oh fuck! Accept it! D-D-Die!

10:50.547 --> 10:52.781
(crying) Oh my God!

10:52.938 --> 10:54.649
That's the red sauce?

10:54.813 --> 10:57.704
That's the marinara? (whimpers)

10:57.922 --> 11:00.195
Holy shit! That is
an adrenaline rush.

11:00.485 --> 11:02.634
I'll tell ya. Killing things
is better than a cup of coffee.

11:02.658 --> 11:04.592
Is that a phrase?
That should be a phrase.

11:04.627 --> 11:07.661
(whimpering) I'm learning
a lot right now.

11:08.220 --> 11:09.423
(Charly whistling)

11:10.368 --> 11:11.599
Egg (muffled): Hey!

11:11.985 --> 11:13.833
- Uh...
- Hey, hey, hey!

11:14.063 --> 11:15.945
- Is anybody there?
- Hello?

11:15.970 --> 11:18.038
I made contact! Who am I talking to?

11:18.313 --> 11:21.008
Oh, my name is Charly.
I guess I'm your big sister.

11:21.043 --> 11:22.209
- Oh my God!
- Yeah.

11:22.244 --> 11:23.579
- It's so nice to meet you!
- Nice to...

11:23.603 --> 11:25.379
I mean, you're still in there, so...

11:25.391 --> 11:27.038
I think I'm your little sister.

11:27.082 --> 11:29.235
I don't feel a bird penis down here.

11:29.329 --> 11:31.050
As far as I can tell. Hey, do you think

11:31.062 --> 11:32.751
you can get me the fuck out of here?

11:32.787 --> 11:35.621
Okay, well, I don't know
if I'm allowed to do that.

11:35.656 --> 11:37.123
Maybe you could just do it yourself?

11:37.158 --> 11:39.423
- That's how I did it.
- You know what? Fuck it.

11:39.501 --> 11:41.145
Back up. I'm just gonna
get a running start.

11:41.169 --> 11:43.869
Okay, I'm in my living room.
Hold on one second.

11:44.040 --> 11:45.719
- [footsteps]
- I'm in my kitchen. Hold on.

11:45.743 --> 11:47.777
I'm in the pantry. Okay,
I'm gonna run in from there.

11:47.801 --> 11:50.635
- Okay, one, two, three.
- (panting, running)

11:50.670 --> 11:54.005
- (screams, crashes)
- Oh no! Oh my God, you did it!

11:54.041 --> 11:54.983
Oh!

11:55.008 --> 11:57.809
- You did it, and you are
very underdeveloped.

11:57.844 --> 12:00.711
Wow! This place is awesome!

12:00.747 --> 12:02.213
- Yeah.
- (pants)

12:02.454 --> 12:05.312
It's so funny. I thought you
were fat from your voice.

12:05.337 --> 12:07.085
You had a fat voice.
Maybe you should go

12:07.097 --> 12:08.814
back in there just a little bit longer.

12:08.839 --> 12:10.654
But you're not. No. I love it out here.

12:10.689 --> 12:13.024
- Hey, how do I look?
- Um...

12:13.049 --> 12:15.140
I feel like I got big o" eyeballs.
Is that right?

12:15.165 --> 12:17.861
Yup. I'm surprised you don't tip
over, 'cause your head is huge.

12:17.896 --> 12:20.596
- I feel weak. I don't feel well.
- Very top-heavy.

12:20.631 --> 12:22.298
- Hey, don't worry, Egg, okay?
- Okay.

12:22.334 --> 12:24.408
Mom's gonna be back any minute with

12:24.420 --> 12:26.804
some food for the both of us. I think.

12:26.829 --> 12:29.138
- Oh!
- What's up? You wanna get high?

12:29.174 --> 12:31.376
- You got that sweet hash? (laughs)
- What?

12:31.401 --> 12:34.173
Just kidding. Come on, man. Loosen up!

12:34.198 --> 12:37.412
I think we're gonna have pretty
different friend groups.

12:37.790 --> 12:39.114
Narrator:
<i>Let's head underground,</i>

12:39.642 --> 12:42.095
<i>where the worm date
is really heating up.</i>

12:42.743 --> 12:45.153
After a while, I realized that
you could kind of parlay that

12:45.189 --> 12:46.989
into what's known as a CPA,

12:47.024 --> 12:49.398
which is not as computer-based
as I would like.

12:49.423 --> 12:50.938
- Yeah.
- Are you okay?

12:51.048 --> 12:53.628
Oh yeah, sorry. I'm just...
I think my face is asleep...

12:53.663 --> 12:56.163
- or my brain, maybe, or something.
- I hate when that happens.

12:56.199 --> 12:58.366
Yeah. So what were
you saying about your HPV?

12:58.401 --> 13:01.462
Yeah, no. It was actually CPA.
It's a little bit different than...

13:01.487 --> 13:02.669
- that one.
- Yeah.

13:02.705 --> 13:04.872
(whispers) Hey, Phil, you're
tanking the date, dude.

13:04.907 --> 13:07.908
- You're bringing everybody down.
- I'm not bringing everyone down!

13:07.943 --> 13:10.791
Phil, when you speak, I want to shimmy

13:10.803 --> 13:13.513
out on a wet sidewalk in the rain,

13:13.548 --> 13:15.074
then suddenly it stops raining, and

13:15.099 --> 13:17.171
people are like walking
on that sidewalk.

13:17.196 --> 13:18.629
Daphne, why are you being
such a bitch to me?

13:18.653 --> 13:19.653
That's not gonna help.

13:19.681 --> 13:22.122
- (gasps)
- Do not call my butthole a bitch.

13:22.157 --> 13:24.102
- I am an asshole. I'm not a bitch.
- Phil: I'm so sorry, Laura.

13:24.126 --> 13:26.204
Laura, Daphne, I'm so sorry. I
don't know where that came from.

13:26.228 --> 13:27.385
That came from a dark place.

13:27.410 --> 13:29.328
All right, let's do what
we came here to do,

13:29.363 --> 13:31.530
and let's have
a fun time tonight, okay?

13:31.565 --> 13:34.166
- Does that sound cool?
- I agree. Have dinner, relax.

13:34.201 --> 13:36.835
A few glasses of wine.
Really get to know each other.

13:36.870 --> 13:38.431
- So, cocaine?
- (ladies cheer)

13:38.705 --> 13:42.641
- Get that Meow Mix out, boo.
- I wanna snort some yam-yam!

13:42.676 --> 13:45.243
- I wanna toot it!
- Gimme that Gucci poochie!

13:45.278 --> 13:47.064
- That's what's up!
- Gucci poochie? Meow mix?

13:47.088 --> 13:48.242
You girls are cool.

13:48.267 --> 13:49.392
Ladies (chanting): Snake Man!
Snake Man!

13:49.416 --> 13:51.682
- Phil: Don't... Stop that.
- Snake Man! Snake Man!

13:51.717 --> 13:54.118
- I'm the Snake Man.
- So, can we have some drugs, though?

13:54.154 --> 13:55.396
Yeah, yeah, yeah, totally.

13:55.421 --> 13:57.171
You know what? Let's chop this shit up.

Laura: I love this song. Oh
my God, it makes me wet.

14:07.199 --> 14:09.644
- Phil: Do you have any 311? Play 311!
- Mike: I'm so fucked up.

14:09.668 --> 14:11.834
Laura, you're so fucking hot.

14:11.870 --> 14:14.404
I'm sorry about before.
I was being a fucking Ben Stein

14:14.440 --> 14:16.184
when I should've been
a fucking Jimmy Kimmel.

14:16.208 --> 14:17.674
Just shove your face in my cleavage.

14:17.709 --> 14:19.841
- I love that.
- (babbles) Now you're my mommy.

14:19.877 --> 14:22.511
- I'm your little baby.
- You like that when I shake my Daphne?

14:22.547 --> 14:24.947
- You're my sister and my butt!
- Oh, this is so hot.

14:24.982 --> 14:26.893
- You're my everything!
- Are you fucking kidding me?

14:26.917 --> 14:28.317
- You're me.
- I love you.

14:28.352 --> 14:30.486
I want more drugs!
I want more drugs!

14:30.521 --> 14:32.621
- Let's get more drugs!
- No, let's get married.

14:32.656 --> 14:34.381
Oh fuck! We should get fucking married!

14:34.406 --> 14:35.288
- Right?

14:35.313 --> 14:37.431
- (cheering)
- Let's get more drugs!

14:38.415 --> 14:39.421
(crying)

14:39.446 --> 14:42.330
Mike: Look, we just want
the drugs, and we're gonna go.

14:42.365 --> 14:43.776
- That's all!
- Dude, shut the fuck up.

14:43.800 --> 14:46.345
You better come up with more money.
You want this Gucci pooch or not?

14:46.369 --> 14:48.536
Y'all trying to get this Meow
Mix or this snaggle rock?

14:48.572 --> 14:50.238
Phil, you're the bookworm.
Figure it out.

14:50.273 --> 14:52.773
The rest of us are idiots,
'cause we're too cool and hot.

14:52.809 --> 14:54.808
Y'all should've got
an education like I did.

14:55.196 --> 14:57.189
Oh my God. See, that's what I'm
talking about this whole time.

14:57.213 --> 14:58.999
My CPA... I got a CPA recently.

14:59.024 --> 15:00.742
- Oh, congratulations.
- Thank you so much!

15:00.767 --> 15:03.183
- What's your name again?
- Yo, my name is Worm-for-all...

15:03.219 --> 15:06.052
- Others: Worm-for-all?
- ...and All-for-worm.

15:06.298 --> 15:07.721
Oh my God.
That's really deep.

15:07.756 --> 15:09.523
- I like that.
- Yeah, no, that's awesome.

15:09.558 --> 15:10.901
- That's really cool.
- That's really cool.

15:10.925 --> 15:12.658
- Why are you dealing drugs?
- Yeah, man.

15:12.693 --> 15:14.494
You know, people make
their own tablecloths.

15:14.529 --> 15:15.961
They make their own pocket squares.

15:15.997 --> 15:17.597
I figured I'd make my own cocaine.

15:17.632 --> 15:20.166
- It's the Etsy economy.
- It's Etsy.

15:20.190 --> 15:20.200
- It's the Etsy economy.
- It's Etsy.

15:20.201 --> 15:22.235
- Oh, my God, I love Etsy.
- What's your Etsy name?

15:22.270 --> 15:25.371
My Etsy name is "You Ain't
High Yet" question mark.

15:25.406 --> 15:26.984
See, that's a great name,
because you're thinking it.

15:27.008 --> 15:28.868
Or you could find me
at "You Better Have

15:28.880 --> 15:30.708
All That Money For That Schnip-Schnap."

15:30.744 --> 15:32.489
- Oh, okay. That's a website?
- That's way too many...

15:32.513 --> 15:35.180
Or you can call me at
1-800-dot-dot-dot-meow-meow.

15:35.215 --> 15:36.581
- That is cute.
- It's catchy, too.

15:36.617 --> 15:38.716
- You have a 1-800 number?
- And I have an emoji.

15:38.752 --> 15:42.320
It's a family around a Thanksgiving
turkey doing cocaine off of it.

15:42.345 --> 15:44.186
Yeah, right. That's not an emoji.

15:44.220 --> 15:45.644
You gotta get the update.
Get the update.

15:45.668 --> 15:46.663
It's clearly an update.

15:46.688 --> 15:49.008
- (gun cocks)
- How about everybody shuts the fuck up?

15:49.033 --> 15:50.966
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.
- Worm-for-all: Be cool, man.

15:51.002 --> 15:52.735
- Who's that?
- Who the fuck is that?

15:52.771 --> 15:55.251
- What are you doing?
- I'm the ass, motherfucker!

15:55.276 --> 15:56.439
- Oh boy.
- Be cool.

15:56.474 --> 15:58.441
Be cool? You were gonna
fuck me out of my take.

15:58.476 --> 16:00.777
I was gonna split it with you,
50-50, just like we said!

16:00.812 --> 16:02.455
Bullshit. I saw the look
in your eyes. I know you.

16:02.479 --> 16:04.070
See? This is the problem
with start-ups,

16:04.082 --> 16:05.647
you know? There's always a frustration.

16:05.682 --> 16:09.183
- I paid for the domain names!
- I got curtains for the trailer!

16:09.219 --> 16:11.420
- Aw.
- But you're never gettin' your half!

16:11.455 --> 16:13.354
- (grunting)
- Yeah, go!

16:13.390 --> 16:15.757
- Oh! Oh my God.
- (gunshot)

16:15.793 --> 16:17.659
- You missed, motherfucker!
- What?

16:17.694 --> 16:19.159
- Yeah!
- Laura: Oh my God!

16:19.194 --> 16:22.157
- (screaming)
- (laughs)

16:22.364 --> 16:24.009
- Yeah, you piece of shit.
- (Worm-for-all gurgles)

16:24.033 --> 16:25.944
- Oh God, he shot his fucking face.
- Think about it!

16:25.968 --> 16:28.113
- I want you to taste that blood.
- That was really stupid.

16:28.137 --> 16:30.805
Yeah, you're one worm.
I think you're gonna die too.

16:30.840 --> 16:31.835
You dum-dum.

16:31.860 --> 16:33.707
Gimme back that Meow
Mix, that fridge dust.

16:33.743 --> 16:36.208
- Just give it to him.
- Okay, here, take the Gucci poochie.

16:36.244 --> 16:38.978
Good, good, good, yeah. Now I'm
in charge of this operation!

16:39.013 --> 16:40.899
- Phil: Uh-oh.
- (fading) No more 50 percent!

16:40.924 --> 16:42.615
- Oh shit.
- There he goes.

16:42.651 --> 16:44.050
That's the other half of...

16:45.654 --> 16:47.884
Narrator: <i>This is why you
don't do drugs, kids.</i>

16:48.222 --> 16:50.368

(coughing)

16:56.263 --> 16:57.896

17:27.125 --> 17:29.837
<i>our possums are about

17:31.041 --> 17:33.642
<i>I like that word. I think it's French?</i>

17:34.063 --> 17:35.259

17:35.579 --> 17:37.968
How's that for a delicious meal? Huh?

17:38.003 --> 17:40.336
Fresh and prepared just how you like it.

17:40.372 --> 17:42.372
Plenty of red sauce, huh? Look at that.

17:42.407 --> 17:44.673
Whoa! Matthew, what the heck?

17:44.709 --> 17:46.892
Don't act like you don't
know what just happened.

17:47.079 --> 17:48.644
- You pushed...
- No, stop it.

17:48.679 --> 17:50.321
You killed that bluebird.

17:50.478 --> 17:51.868
You didn't know that bird.

17:51.893 --> 17:55.017
That bird could've had a
family, and you killed it!

17:55.052 --> 17:57.486
You're a murderer, Dad! A murderer!

17:57.522 --> 17:59.995
You're calling me a murderer? I would

18:00.007 --> 18:02.358
say, I'm a murderer! I killed it!

18:02.383 --> 18:04.859
- (laughs)
- That is your fucked-up generation!

18:04.895 --> 18:08.029
- Nobody thinks that way anymore!
- I'm sorry, but you keep saying

18:08.064 --> 18:11.265
"a different generation." I'm
seven weeks older than you.

18:11.300 --> 18:15.403
We were both born during the
same season of <i> Better Call Saul.</i>

18:15.438 --> 18:17.304
We went to high school briefly together.

18:17.340 --> 18:21.041
I'm not that much older. I
was born when the 6 was out

18:21.076 --> 18:23.343
and you were born
during the release of the 6s.

18:23.378 --> 18:26.046
I think the only difference
was the fingerprint thing,

18:26.081 --> 18:27.618
- which we couldn't use.
- (sighs)

18:27.950 --> 18:30.350
Look, I understand your larger point,

18:30.385 --> 18:32.553
that we might think
differently, but again,

18:32.588 --> 18:34.283
it's a very, very narrow slice of

18:34.308 --> 18:36.517
experience that we're
talking about here.

18:36.691 --> 18:38.991
We got tetanus shots on the same day.
I mean...

18:39.027 --> 18:40.960
I'm not gonna continue
the cycle of abuse.

18:41.005 --> 18:42.805
Matthew. You're playing a game

18:42.830 --> 18:45.731
where you're capturing things
constantly. Why is this any different?

18:45.767 --> 18:47.300
There's a huge difference, Dad. When

18:47.312 --> 18:48.901
I capture something, I care for it.

18:48.937 --> 18:52.270
I feed it. I give it a home. I give
it love. I give it a community.

18:52.305 --> 18:55.306
I don't tear it apart, bone by
bone and take its marinara.

18:55.341 --> 18:57.241
Well, this is exactly the same thing,

18:57.277 --> 18:59.811
except you do tear it apart
and drink its blood.

18:59.846 --> 19:02.094
I don't understand.
This is how we survive.

19:02.119 --> 19:03.014
It's not... God!

19:03.050 --> 19:04.716
Again, that's your limited mind...

19:04.751 --> 19:06.860
Life is real. It's not
something on a screen.

19:06.885 --> 19:08.730
- It doesn't have to be!
- Okay, I'm taking the phone.

19:08.754 --> 19:10.788
- (gasps) No!
- I'm taking the phone.

19:10.823 --> 19:12.146
You're not taking my phone, Dad! That

19:12.158 --> 19:13.602
is the only reality that's safe to me!

19:13.626 --> 19:15.549
- Yup, yup. Yup, yup. Okay.
- Everything else is dysfunctional!

19:15.573 --> 19:17.406
You will get this phone back

19:17.663 --> 19:20.731
when you go out and get
some food for yourself.

19:20.868 --> 19:22.071
(humphs, mutters)

19:23.181 --> 19:25.524
Narrator: <i>Hey, what's
happening back in the nest?</i>

19:26.040 --> 19:27.360
<i>Let's go find out.</i>

19:27.639 --> 19:29.853
<i>It's a TV show. We can do that.</i>

19:30.197 --> 19:32.541
- (both laugh)
- You did that?

19:32.588 --> 19:35.188
- I did. Yeah.
- You were like, "Hey, are you Mom?"

19:35.213 --> 19:37.680
I did. I was... foot right in mouth.

19:37.716 --> 19:39.582
That's so... (coughs)

19:39.618 --> 19:42.051
- Oh God. What happened?
- Ugh.

19:42.087 --> 19:44.352
I'm okay. I'm just so hungry.

19:44.387 --> 19:46.722
For one second, your humor
took me away from it,

19:46.757 --> 19:48.624
but I really do need to eat.

19:48.659 --> 19:51.359
Okay, just... I need you
to trust me right now.

19:51.394 --> 19:53.028
- Just open your mouth.
- What?

19:53.063 --> 19:54.930
- (straining)
- Oh God. What's going on?

19:54.965 --> 19:56.309
- I don't know!
- What are you doing?

19:56.333 --> 19:57.115
Sorry, I'm just...

19:57.140 --> 19:59.200
Okay, just stop trying
to barf on me, please.

19:59.236 --> 20:00.534
- Just let me die.
- What?

20:00.569 --> 20:02.637
- Then you can eat me.
- I'm not gonna eat you.

20:02.672 --> 20:04.297
Listen, that shit happens all the time.

20:04.322 --> 20:04.839
No.

20:04.881 --> 20:08.313
- I am okay with it. It's okay.
- You're not appetizing at all.

20:08.338 --> 20:09.744
You look nothing like Mom's barf.

20:09.779 --> 20:11.612
You gotta do what you gotta do.

20:11.907 --> 20:13.492
- (sighs) I'm gonna go.
- What do you mean?

20:13.516 --> 20:15.816
I'm gonna find food, and I'm
gonna bring it back to you.

20:15.852 --> 20:18.384
What do you mean?
We don't know how to fly yet.

20:18.419 --> 20:20.787
That's okay. I'll figure it out.
It's innate.

20:20.822 --> 20:23.189
Maybe not day one,
but maybe I'm a champion.

20:23.224 --> 20:25.825
Oh God. Charly, I really don't
feel comfortable with this.

20:25.861 --> 20:27.894
I would much rather
you just eat me right now.

20:27.929 --> 20:29.729
I mean, how hard can this be, you know?

20:29.765 --> 20:32.632
Edge of the nest, just jump off and...
Oh my God!

20:32.668 --> 20:34.392
No way am I jum...
(screaming)

20:35.402 --> 20:36.415
Charly!

20:39.337 --> 20:40.372
(grunts)

20:41.408 --> 20:43.688
(coughing) Oh God.

20:43.811 --> 20:45.477
Egg: Charly, are you okay?

20:45.512 --> 20:48.047
Yeah, I think I landed weird,
but I'll be all right.

20:48.082 --> 20:51.716
Oh, okay. 'Cause I was gonna
eat you if you were dead.

20:51.751 --> 20:54.251
- JK. But I really would have.
- All right.

20:54.754 --> 20:57.399
Mission Food, engage.

20:57.970 --> 21:00.091
Narrator: <i>On the ground,
our worm friends partake</i>

21:00.126 --> 21:03.087

21:03.884 --> 21:06.220
<i>Inch, get it? 'Cause they're worms.</i>

21:07.074 --> 21:08.338
<i>Hey, didn't I ask for a water?</i>

21:08.500 --> 21:11.267
Dude, fucking Daphne was into me, man.

21:11.303 --> 21:14.771
Like, I know it sorta ended on a
question mark with all of us,

21:14.807 --> 21:16.624
- but like, oh my God.
- Shut up. Shut up. Shut up.

21:16.648 --> 21:19.183
- She was fucking...
- Fucking shut the fuck up, okay, dude?

21:19.211 --> 21:20.577
Okay. Whoa, Phil.

21:20.612 --> 21:22.119
No! No, no! The same
exact fucking scene

21:22.131 --> 21:23.391
played out that always plays out!

21:23.415 --> 21:25.881
Things were going great, and
then you got us high on cocaine,

21:25.917 --> 21:27.783
and then everything got ruined!
We almost died!

21:27.819 --> 21:29.185
- Oh, I'm the problem?
- Yeah!

21:29.220 --> 21:30.530
I think you're conveniently forgetting

21:30.554 --> 21:33.222
that you were dragging down the
entire table the entire night!

21:33.257 --> 21:34.501
Things were going great
with me and Laura!

21:34.525 --> 21:36.201
You were talking about
accounting the whole night.

21:36.225 --> 21:36.759
Fuck you.

21:36.794 --> 21:39.762
She was looking at me! She loves
the Snake Man! Are you kidding me?

21:39.797 --> 21:42.230
I honestly don't want to be
worms with you anymore.

21:42.563 --> 21:44.134
I swear to fucking God.

21:45.035 --> 21:47.907
All right, you can't <i>Fight
Club</i> me two times in one day.

21:47.932 --> 21:49.370
That's not how it works, dude.

21:49.405 --> 21:51.684
- (whispers) I'm not Fight-Clubbing you.
- (heavy footsteps)

21:51.708 --> 21:54.475
- I'm fucking scared.
- (gasps)

21:54.954 --> 21:56.220
Phil: Oh fuck, dude.

21:56.360 --> 21:57.728
Charly: Oh, here we go.

21:57.845 --> 21:59.493
Okay, so this is a worm.

21:59.518 --> 22:01.688
This is what all the
hubbub was about, huh?

22:01.713 --> 22:03.746
Yeah. I could see eating this.

22:03.953 --> 22:05.819
(whispers) What the
fuck are we gonna do?

22:05.855 --> 22:07.540
Maybe the bird will think I'm a snake?

22:07.890 --> 22:09.757
- (hissing)
- Yeah, hiss at it.

22:09.792 --> 22:11.302
- Oh God, it's not working!
- Mike: Is it working?

22:11.326 --> 22:13.560
Okay, maybe she'll think
we're Eddie Murphy

22:13.595 --> 22:14.494
- if I do some bits.
- Do some bits.

22:14.529 --> 22:16.295
- Okay.
- Do the one about Chinese people!

22:16.330 --> 22:18.142
- Ah, that feels hard to say.
- Yeah, I know it's dated.

22:18.166 --> 22:19.498
- It's dated.
- Both: It's dated.

22:19.533 --> 22:20.967
- (chirps)
- (both scream)

22:21.267 --> 22:23.335
Oh, you tried to get
away, but you can't.

22:23.371 --> 22:25.938
I got ahold of you with
my little, tiny feet.

22:26.782 --> 22:27.874
(licks) Oh God!

22:27.909 --> 22:30.243
You taste like sweat and...
is it cocaine?

22:30.278 --> 22:32.478
All right, I got this. I got this.

22:32.513 --> 22:34.246
This doesn't look appetizing at all,

22:34.281 --> 22:35.680
but I can do this. (hisses)

22:35.715 --> 22:38.962
Narrator: <i>Prey has become the predator.</i>

22:39.352 --> 22:40.501
(both scream)

22:41.789 --> 22:43.931
(chews) Oh God!

22:43.956 --> 22:46.792
What is that? What is that? (spits)

22:46.827 --> 22:48.894
Jesus. That does not taste good.

22:48.929 --> 22:51.796
I mean, the texture alone...
that is tough stuff.

22:51.845 --> 22:54.087
All right. Worm number one.

22:54.548 --> 22:58.579
You got this, Matthew.
And five, four, three...

22:59.349 --> 23:00.524
(Matthew growling)

23:02.008 --> 23:04.875
- (hisses)
- Charly: Oh God, you're so fierce.

23:05.407 --> 23:07.977
- (munching)
- Oh, okay. You're not a bird guy.

23:08.013 --> 23:10.180
Mmm. That's not bad!

23:10.215 --> 23:13.149
Oh my God. And it's fields of
them just ready to be taken.

23:13.185 --> 23:15.285
Wait a second. This is in our nature.

23:15.320 --> 23:17.586
Nature is supposed
to be consumed by nature.

23:17.622 --> 23:20.423
(laughs) I mean, please, I'm
gonna miss the marinara,

23:20.458 --> 23:21.803
but I can figure something out. (gasps)

23:21.827 --> 23:24.026
Oh my God. Those right
there could be croutons.

23:24.061 --> 23:27.751
(groaning) That thing
fucking chomped us, Mike.

23:28.298 --> 23:30.999
- Oh boy.
- I brought this upon us, man.

23:31.035 --> 23:33.135
I fucking wished for it. I'm sorry.

23:33.170 --> 23:35.070
I loved being worms with you, dude.

23:35.105 --> 23:37.039
You're my best fucking friend, man.

23:37.074 --> 23:38.707
- You mean it?
- Yeah, dude.

23:38.742 --> 23:41.775
(burps) Oh God.
That was a funny burp.

23:41.811 --> 23:43.290
- Hey, Phil?
- Yeah, Mike?

23:43.746 --> 23:46.580
Last night was
the best night of my life.

23:46.837 --> 23:48.782
- Me too.
- (both chuckle weakly)

23:48.899 --> 23:51.853
- This is it. I feel something, man.
- (squishing)

23:51.888 --> 23:54.860
I feel something happening. (grunts)

23:56.625 --> 23:58.478
- (pops) Papa?
- What the?

23:58.760 --> 24:01.704
- I fucking regenerated, dude.
- Holy shit.

24:01.729 --> 24:04.353
It's Little Phil! I'm
a fucking dad, dude!

24:04.699 --> 24:08.168
- Hey, little dude.
- Invest in a 401k early.

24:08.203 --> 24:10.056
- (squishing, grunting)
- (pops)

24:10.172 --> 24:12.072
Oh my God! A Little Mike!

24:12.107 --> 24:13.874
Phil: Aww, he's got your smile.

24:13.909 --> 24:15.540
- Oh my God.
- We're dads.

24:15.576 --> 24:17.442
Mike and Phil: We're dads, dude.

24:17.478 --> 24:20.149
I don't (long bleep)!

24:20.214 --> 24:22.147
(Mike laughs) You cannot
say that anymore.

24:22.183 --> 24:23.916
You can't say that anymore. That's...

24:23.951 --> 24:26.185
(sighs) Hey. What's wrong, Mike?

24:26.220 --> 24:28.320
It's just... I guess
that now that we're separate,

24:28.356 --> 24:30.142
we're no longer gonna be roommates.

24:30.259 --> 24:32.056
I think we should be roommates,

24:32.092 --> 24:34.009
just now we'll really be friends,

- Yeah.

Okay. Thank you!
