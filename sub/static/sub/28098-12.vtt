WEBVTT

00:04.800 --> 00:07.150
Previously on
"The Enemy Within"...

00:07.200 --> 00:08.526
Your ex-husband
came to visit you?

00:08.550 --> 00:10.046
- Does he know about Hannah?
- He does.

00:10.070 --> 00:11.770
And he's okay with her
visiting you?

00:14.030 --> 00:16.030
No. I can't see her anymore.

00:16.079 --> 00:18.120
Anna Cruz was your last mistake.

00:18.160 --> 00:19.690
Next one, you're out.

00:19.730 --> 00:21.430
There's not gonna be
anymore mistakes.

00:21.470 --> 00:23.040
If you want to keep
that promise,

00:23.080 --> 00:25.690
I suggest you stop relying on
the advice of a traitor.

00:25.740 --> 00:27.546
Tell me what Tal's planning
in Sierra Maestra.

00:27.570 --> 00:29.700
There's going to be
another strike.

00:29.740 --> 00:31.050
A major attack.

00:31.090 --> 00:33.700
It's going to be right here
in D.C.

00:33.750 --> 00:36.440
You had Tal in your grasp
and you let him slip away.

00:36.490 --> 00:39.190
Catching Tal comes at
a very high price.

00:39.230 --> 00:42.360
And from the actions
that I've seen,

00:42.410 --> 00:44.540
you're not willing to pay it.

00:44.580 --> 00:46.850
I don't need be a murderer
to catch one.

00:48.590 --> 00:50.410
Tal?

00:50.460 --> 00:52.330
He's closing in on you.
I know you feel it.

00:52.370 --> 00:53.770
I can help you.

00:53.810 --> 00:55.070
Why would you do this now?

00:55.110 --> 00:59.470
I am not going to die in a cage.

01:07.820 --> 01:12.870
Mr. Backus, thank you
for meeting me.

01:12.910 --> 01:15.790
You didn't give me a choice.

01:15.830 --> 01:17.090
Who are you?

01:17.140 --> 01:19.230
Who I am is not important.

01:19.270 --> 01:23.320
What's important is
what I know about you.

01:23.360 --> 01:26.100
How did you get that tape?

01:29.020 --> 01:30.670
What are you gonna do with it?

01:30.720 --> 01:33.020
You're an important man
at the Pentagon.

01:33.070 --> 01:36.590
I want to know what you know,
I want to see what you see.

01:36.630 --> 01:40.640
Oh, that tape is not worth
committing treason over.

01:40.680 --> 01:43.950
But that's not all I'm
offering for your cooperation.

01:43.990 --> 01:47.950
I know what you desire more
than anything in your life.

01:47.990 --> 01:51.130
Power. True power.

01:51.170 --> 01:54.260
But you have yet to obtain it.

01:54.300 --> 01:56.260
You haven't been allowed
into the room

01:56.310 --> 01:58.790
where the real decisions
are made.

01:58.830 --> 02:00.220
I can get you there.

02:00.270 --> 02:03.010
- What are we talking about?
- A directorship?

02:03.050 --> 02:04.620
Bigger.

02:04.660 --> 02:09.800
National Security Advisor to
the United States of America.

02:09.840 --> 02:11.450
Who are you?

02:11.500 --> 02:14.190
You already know that.

02:15.240 --> 02:17.810
Tal.

02:19.000 --> 02:25.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:29.300 --> 02:32.690
Hawkins is never going
to vote against the bill

02:32.730 --> 02:34.236
because he cannot survive
another primary

02:34.260 --> 02:35.650
like last year's.

02:35.690 --> 02:38.220
The only way we can fight it is
in appropriations.

02:38.260 --> 02:40.790
- Congresswoman Bell.
- Thank you so much.

02:40.830 --> 02:42.570
Ray, how are you?

02:42.610 --> 02:46.010
We need to talk about funding
for my NIH initiative.

02:46.050 --> 02:47.710
Right idea, wrong place.

02:47.750 --> 02:49.320
Okay, well, you said
that last week.

02:49.360 --> 02:51.490
Do I need to worry about
your support?

02:51.540 --> 02:54.280
- No, call my office.
- I'll set up a meeting.

02:55.580 --> 02:57.450
That's my cue.
Thanks, Ray.

02:57.500 --> 02:59.020
Good morning.

02:59.060 --> 03:02.020
If you can all take your seats,
we'll get started.

03:02.070 --> 03:04.160
Listen to me, Desmond.

03:04.200 --> 03:05.980
The next 20 seconds
will determine

03:06.030 --> 03:07.680
the next 20 years of your life.

03:07.730 --> 03:10.380
Tal is planning an attack in a
tourist attraction here in D.C.

03:10.420 --> 03:12.160
You've already told us that.

03:12.210 --> 03:14.250
Which one is it?

03:14.300 --> 03:16.340
You can ask me a thousand times.

03:16.390 --> 03:18.340
My answer remains the same.

03:18.390 --> 03:21.260
I don't know.

03:21.300 --> 03:23.830
I sold Tal that report.

03:23.870 --> 03:25.130
But until last month,

03:25.180 --> 03:28.700
I've had zero contact with him
or his people.

03:28.750 --> 03:30.920
Why would Tal tell me anything?

03:30.970 --> 03:34.360
Welcome to The Council for
American Strategies' symposium,

03:34.400 --> 03:36.230
"America in the Future."

03:36.280 --> 03:38.540
We think the future is
a bright one

03:38.580 --> 03:40.410
thanks in part
to the strong vision

03:40.450 --> 03:42.370
and leadership of individuals

03:42.410 --> 03:44.330
like our guest speaker
this morning.

03:44.370 --> 03:47.070
But Tal paid you
for that report.

03:47.110 --> 03:48.420
Was that all he paid you for?

03:48.460 --> 03:50.770
What else did you do for him?

03:50.810 --> 03:54.550
He had me work up
a dossier on someone.

03:54.600 --> 03:58.380
Home address, contact
information, financials.

03:58.430 --> 04:00.300
Along with more sensitive intel.

04:00.340 --> 04:01.780
Like what?

04:01.820 --> 04:04.520
Family members, daily schedule.

04:07.000 --> 04:09.530
Sounds like
an assassination workup.

04:09.570 --> 04:12.920
I didn't ask, but yes,

04:12.960 --> 04:15.450
that's what I believed it to be.

04:16.920 --> 04:18.540
Who is the target?

04:18.579 --> 04:20.579
She's a three-term congresswoman

04:20.620 --> 04:22.500
from Florida's 28th district.

04:22.540 --> 04:26.330
She also happens to be
a Miami football fan,

04:26.370 --> 04:28.850
but I promised not
to hold that against her.

04:30.460 --> 04:33.200
Please welcome Congresswoman
Evelyn Bell.

04:38.080 --> 04:40.910
It's good to see you.

04:40.950 --> 04:43.600
- Thank you for that.
- Go for it.

04:43.650 --> 04:45.846
- Good morning, everyone.
- Thank you so much for coming.

04:45.870 --> 04:49.310
Get down!

04:50.610 --> 04:52.740
Jacquie,
secure the congresswoman!

04:52.790 --> 04:54.440
- I've got her.
- Congresswoman!

05:00.970 --> 05:02.320
- Take it easy.
- Stay back.

05:02.360 --> 05:03.710
Put the gun down.

05:03.750 --> 05:05.360
- I mean it.
- Don't come any closer.

05:05.410 --> 05:09.060
- No one has to get hurt, man.
- Let her go. Let her go.

05:09.110 --> 05:11.070
I'll circle around.

05:13.420 --> 05:15.030
Get down!

05:32.440 --> 05:34.130
Drop it!

05:51.930 --> 05:55.240
We have to ask ourselves,
"What's wrong?"

05:55.280 --> 05:59.240
What's causing the
Deputy Director at the CIA

05:59.290 --> 06:03.030
to turn against this
great country of ours?

06:03.070 --> 06:04.510
Three years ago.

06:04.550 --> 06:06.380
Congresswoman Evelyn Bell
built her career

06:06.430 --> 06:07.966
on being tough on
National Security issues.

06:07.990 --> 06:10.300
Erica Shepherd has done
irrevocable damage

06:10.340 --> 06:11.690
to this country.

06:11.740 --> 06:13.430
We need to punish her.

06:13.480 --> 06:15.780
We need to lock her in a cell
and throw away the key.

06:15.830 --> 06:19.440
We need to send
the strongest message we can

06:19.480 --> 06:23.050
so that this can
never happen again.

06:23.090 --> 06:26.920
- I remember these speeches.
- She really went after you.

06:26.970 --> 06:28.880
She exploited my case
for political gain.

06:28.930 --> 06:30.800
Or she meant what she said.

06:30.840 --> 06:32.580
She wrote a letter to
the judge on your case

06:32.630 --> 06:34.410
advocating for
the death penalty.

06:34.450 --> 06:36.060
I'm aware.

06:36.110 --> 06:37.720
Bell's en route to
an FBI safe house.

06:37.760 --> 06:40.460
She claims she has no idea
why she was attacked.

06:40.500 --> 06:41.980
She's lying.

06:42.030 --> 06:44.460
Well, she was also almost
killed this morning.

06:44.510 --> 06:46.940
So what? One has nothing
to do with the other.

06:46.990 --> 06:49.160
The question is,
why is Tal targeting

06:49.210 --> 06:50.820
a powerful congresswoman?

06:50.860 --> 06:52.406
Why now on the eve
of two massive attacks?

06:52.430 --> 06:54.730
We've learned this lesson
again and again, Agent Keaton.

06:54.780 --> 06:57.910
Tal's actions are never random.

06:57.960 --> 06:59.610
That's your
professional opinion?

06:59.650 --> 07:01.520
You're in no way biased
towards her

07:01.570 --> 07:03.350
because of what she said
about you?

07:03.400 --> 07:05.440
No.

07:05.480 --> 07:06.620
The assassination attempt

07:06.660 --> 07:07.726
could be connected
to Tal's attacks.

07:07.750 --> 07:09.050
We should question her.

07:09.100 --> 07:11.840
What is it?

07:11.880 --> 07:14.580
Molinero's calling a meeting
about the Tal investigation.

07:14.620 --> 07:16.670
- Is there a problem?
- I don't know,

07:16.710 --> 07:18.670
but the National Security
Advisor's in it.

07:26.810 --> 07:29.680
That was a close call today,
Agent Keaton.

07:29.730 --> 07:31.640
Yes. Yes... yes, it was.

07:31.680 --> 07:34.120
Uh, thankfully
Congresswoman Bell was saved

07:34.170 --> 07:36.040
due to the intelligence

07:36.080 --> 07:37.880
that was gathered by
my team's investigations.

07:37.910 --> 07:40.106
We're drilling down on all
the relevant intel right now,

07:40.130 --> 07:42.090
and we will catch Tal.

07:42.130 --> 07:44.180
Is that so?

07:46.350 --> 07:47.960
Yes, sir. It is.

07:48.010 --> 07:50.270
There is a strong belief
in this room

07:50.310 --> 07:52.840
that you've compromised
your ideals as a result

07:52.880 --> 07:56.320
of your continued cooperation
with Erica Shepherd.

07:56.360 --> 07:58.760
Well, that belief is wrong.

07:59.540 --> 08:01.630
The National Security Council

08:01.670 --> 08:04.150
is taking over
the Tal investigation.

08:04.200 --> 08:05.940
That is a mistake.

08:05.980 --> 08:08.070
No one has a better chance
of catching Tal than I do.

08:08.110 --> 08:09.550
I understand that
you're upset...

08:09.590 --> 08:11.810
My whole career,

08:11.860 --> 08:13.290
I've put the safety
of this country

08:13.330 --> 08:16.640
above all the bureaucracy
and agency politics.

08:18.860 --> 08:20.560
Are you?

08:20.600 --> 08:25.170
A congressional leader
was almost killed today.

08:25.220 --> 08:28.650
There's an imminent attack
about to happen on U.S. soil

08:28.700 --> 08:31.050
and you don't even know
the target.

08:31.090 --> 08:33.179
Let's get something straight,
Agent Keaton.

08:33.220 --> 08:36.580
This is about the safety
of this country.

08:36.620 --> 08:40.710
I expect the case files
by the end of the day.

08:45.980 --> 08:48.890
- Three years wasted.
- Not wasted.

08:48.940 --> 08:51.370
How can you say that when
Tal is still out there?

08:51.420 --> 08:52.720
The work that we've done

08:52.770 --> 08:54.590
is gonna help the next team
being them down.

08:54.640 --> 08:56.860
Who's getting the case? CIA?

08:56.900 --> 08:59.380
Backus is putting together
a fusion cell

08:59.420 --> 09:01.690
from multiple agencies.

09:01.730 --> 09:03.600
But he hasn't done that yet.

09:03.650 --> 09:05.470
Molinero is allowing us
to stay on the case

09:05.520 --> 09:07.000
until the new team takes over.

09:07.040 --> 09:10.040
My guess? Two, maybe three days
before that happens.

09:10.090 --> 09:12.610
And that's two to three days
that I am not gonna waste.

09:12.660 --> 09:14.570
- Now we're talking.
- What's the plan?

09:14.610 --> 09:17.090
Tal is gonna hit
a D.C. tour site.

09:17.140 --> 09:19.230
We need to know
which one and when.

09:19.270 --> 09:21.140
What about, uh,
Congresswoman Bell?

09:21.190 --> 09:23.426
If Shepherd's right, she might
have the information we need.

09:23.450 --> 09:25.580
I'm heading to the safe house
as soon as we're done.

09:25.620 --> 09:26.736
Do you want me to question her?

09:26.760 --> 09:28.036
- No, no.
- Because of who she is,

09:28.060 --> 09:29.720
it's not gonna be
a normal interrogation.

09:29.760 --> 09:30.996
So how do you want to play it?

09:31.020 --> 09:32.460
I have something in mind.

09:32.500 --> 09:33.890
And there's something else,

09:33.940 --> 09:36.590
but it has to stay inside
this office.

09:36.640 --> 09:38.460
I want to look into Paul Backus.

09:41.340 --> 09:43.396
You want to investigate
the National Security Advisor?

09:43.420 --> 09:47.120
- It's the way this was done.
- It's the timing of it.

09:47.170 --> 09:48.950
Something's not right.

09:49.000 --> 09:50.610
Bragg, you still have
your contact

09:50.650 --> 09:51.756
at the Senate Intel Committee?

09:51.780 --> 09:53.130
Yeah, talked to him last week.

09:53.170 --> 09:55.440
See if they have anything
on Backus.

09:55.480 --> 09:58.050
Daniel, I want you
to do a deep dive

09:58.090 --> 10:00.660
into his contacts
and financials.

10:00.700 --> 10:01.946
I want to know who
he's talking to

10:01.970 --> 10:03.400
and where that money
is coming from.

10:03.440 --> 10:05.230
You know we won't get
a warrant for this.

10:05.270 --> 10:06.670
I know.

10:06.710 --> 10:09.410
If that's a problem for you,
I understand.

10:11.760 --> 10:15.460
No, I'll do it.

10:15.500 --> 10:18.110
Let's get to it.

10:26.900 --> 10:28.860
When the case is gone, so am I.

10:28.910 --> 10:30.650
Is that what you want
to tell me?

10:30.690 --> 10:32.780
Yes.

10:33.690 --> 10:35.350
My ex-husband won't
let me see my girl;

10:35.390 --> 10:38.090
the Tal investigation
is being taken away.

10:39.570 --> 10:41.870
I'm done here.

10:41.920 --> 10:43.750
I'm sorry, Erica.

10:44.830 --> 10:46.310
Congresswoman Bell.

10:46.360 --> 10:47.856
You said you had something
in mind for questioning her?

10:47.880 --> 10:50.490
Well, that depends.

10:50.540 --> 10:52.320
Are you busy the next few hours?

10:54.840 --> 10:57.850
I think I'm free.

10:59.240 --> 11:01.330
Congresswoman Bell,
how you feeling?

11:01.370 --> 11:02.720
I've been better.

11:02.770 --> 11:04.290
How long do I have to stay here?

11:04.330 --> 11:06.380
There's time-critical work
for me back on the Hill.

11:06.420 --> 11:08.730
We'll get you out of here
as soon as we can.

11:08.770 --> 11:10.510
How we looking out front?

11:10.560 --> 11:12.170
All clear in the front, sir.

11:12.210 --> 11:13.510
- Out back?
- All is clear.

11:13.560 --> 11:14.820
Good.

11:14.860 --> 11:17.000
There's 700,000 citizens
in my district.

11:17.040 --> 11:19.350
325 million in the country.

11:19.390 --> 11:21.270
Do you think I'll really
be able to protect them

11:21.310 --> 11:24.000
from national security threats
while I'm locked up in here?

11:24.050 --> 11:26.220
We're just trying
to ensure your safety.

11:26.270 --> 11:29.440
Well, who's going to ensure
safety of the American people?

11:32.580 --> 11:34.190
What's going on?
Why is she here?

11:34.230 --> 11:36.360
Shepherd is cooperating
with the FBI

11:36.410 --> 11:38.710
on the Tal investigation.

11:40.670 --> 11:42.330
I have some questions for you.

11:42.370 --> 11:43.410
You can't be serious.

11:43.460 --> 11:45.110
It's not gonna take long.

11:45.160 --> 11:46.810
Because I won't be a part of it.

11:46.850 --> 11:48.086
We need to have a conversation.

11:48.110 --> 11:50.030
You're a convicted felon.

11:50.070 --> 11:52.470
You have no authority
to tell me what to do.

11:52.510 --> 11:53.990
I do.

11:55.470 --> 11:57.820
Do you really want to do
this, Agent Keaton?

11:57.860 --> 12:00.610
What I want is
to stop Mikhail Tal.

12:00.650 --> 12:04.520
Your lack of cooperation is
keeping me from doing that.

12:05.920 --> 12:08.960
Oh, let's do this.

12:09.010 --> 12:11.010
It should be fun.

12:17.450 --> 12:19.360
So what is this?

12:19.410 --> 12:22.190
Some... some grade school version
of payback for what I said

12:22.240 --> 12:24.036
about you three years ago?
'Cause I don't care.

12:24.060 --> 12:26.410
I never thought you did care.

12:26.460 --> 12:28.980
I did assume that you
used me to gin up fear

12:29.030 --> 12:31.240
for your own
political ascension.

12:31.290 --> 12:35.210
Effective, but
utterly unimaginative.

12:35.250 --> 12:36.730
Yes.

12:36.770 --> 12:40.040
Not nearly as creative as
your multiple acts of treason.

12:40.080 --> 12:42.040
Why do you think Tal
is trying to kill you?

12:42.080 --> 12:43.650
- I have no idea.
- None?

12:43.690 --> 12:48.260
Well, you're
the expert on Tal. Not me.

12:49.480 --> 12:52.400
You seem so strong.

12:52.440 --> 12:55.570
You seem so unbending
in your beliefs.

12:55.620 --> 12:58.100
But I think I see why you're
projecting such strength

12:58.140 --> 12:59.930
because inside you're shaking.

12:59.970 --> 13:01.880
Tal wants you dead.

13:01.930 --> 13:03.760
He is relentlessly planning
your assassination

13:03.800 --> 13:05.580
and he's not gonna stop
until he succeeds,

13:05.630 --> 13:07.410
and you're afraid.

13:07.450 --> 13:09.980
And I think you now
why Tal wants you dead.

13:10.020 --> 13:12.590
So what is it?

13:12.630 --> 13:16.640
Something personal?
Something in your past?

13:20.860 --> 13:23.470
That's it, isn't it?
Something in your past?

13:24.990 --> 13:28.260
You're right.
This is gonna be fun.

13:28.300 --> 13:30.610
You always were punctual,
Vargas.

13:30.650 --> 13:32.920
Rangers didn't give us much
of a choice, did they?

13:32.960 --> 13:35.050
- No, they didn't.
- Thanks for meeting.

13:35.090 --> 13:36.880
I wouldn't have asked
if it wasn't important.

13:36.920 --> 13:39.700
I figured that when you called.

13:39.750 --> 13:41.620
So, what's up?

13:41.660 --> 13:43.450
Working a counterintel
investigation

13:43.490 --> 13:44.800
over at the Bureau.

13:44.840 --> 13:46.360
I'm looking for background on

13:46.410 --> 13:49.190
a senior level
intelligence officer.

13:49.240 --> 13:51.500
Paul Backus.

13:53.330 --> 13:55.680
- Are you joking?
- Anything you got.

13:55.720 --> 13:59.680
Financial ties, foreign
contacts, personal issues...

13:59.720 --> 14:02.160
You want me to leak dirt
on the NSC advisor

14:02.210 --> 14:04.510
to the United States?

14:05.640 --> 14:07.600
This could cost me my career.

14:07.650 --> 14:09.300
Yeah, me too.

14:09.340 --> 14:14.430
But there's a chance Backus is
tangled up in some trouble.

14:14.480 --> 14:18.790
Backus has a
reputation for being slippery.

14:18.830 --> 14:21.270
He doesn't always stick
to his word.

14:21.310 --> 14:22.750
Anything else?

14:22.790 --> 14:26.270
No, but I'll look into it
and see what I can find.

14:26.320 --> 14:30.490
But Bragg, this is
the last time I do this.

14:30.540 --> 14:33.060
I understand.

14:33.110 --> 14:35.890
What is it? What is it
you're not telling us?

14:39.160 --> 14:40.330
Nothing.

14:40.370 --> 14:41.810
After three terms in Congress,

14:41.850 --> 14:43.770
I thought you'd be
a more convincing liar.

14:43.810 --> 14:46.160
Well, maybe you can
give me some tips

14:46.210 --> 14:47.640
on how it's done.

14:47.690 --> 14:49.250
I want to talk to
the Deputy Director.

14:49.300 --> 14:50.600
Call Molinero.

14:50.640 --> 14:52.170
She's not available.

14:52.210 --> 14:53.820
I knew it.

14:53.870 --> 14:56.000
You're on your own on this,
aren't you?

14:56.040 --> 14:59.480
Well, you've made a serious
miscalculation, Agent Keaton.

14:59.520 --> 15:01.530
Shepherd here has talked you
out on a limb,

15:01.570 --> 15:02.846
and it's breaking
underneath you.

15:02.870 --> 15:04.620
You don't know
what you're talking about.

15:04.660 --> 15:07.530
Really? I didn't get as far
as I am today by being stupid.

15:07.570 --> 15:09.930
I know that this
is unsanctioned.

15:09.970 --> 15:12.450
I don't know why
you're really here.

15:12.490 --> 15:15.190
I know that you betrayed
your country.

15:15.230 --> 15:18.800
You participated in the death
of four CIA operatives

15:18.850 --> 15:21.720
and God knows
how many other people.

15:21.760 --> 15:27.380
And now here you are trying
to stop Tal supposedly?

15:27.420 --> 15:30.600
So what is that?
What happened?

15:30.640 --> 15:33.770
'Cause you're never getting
out of jail.

15:34.950 --> 15:36.600
What are you hiding?

15:38.950 --> 15:41.870
Are you trying
to redeem yourself?

15:42.740 --> 15:46.090
Trying to make up
for what you did?

15:47.270 --> 15:49.010
Nothing you can ever do

15:49.050 --> 15:51.010
will make up for the lives
you took.

15:51.050 --> 15:53.100
Nothing.

15:56.450 --> 15:58.230
Thank you.

15:58.280 --> 15:59.630
For what?

15:59.670 --> 16:01.240
Confirming what
I already suspected.

16:01.280 --> 16:03.070
You're former CIA.

16:04.070 --> 16:06.810
- That's ridiculous.
- The way you comport yourself.

16:06.850 --> 16:09.550
Your mannerisms when
you're being questioned.

16:09.590 --> 16:12.420
It's all classic
CIA interrogation training.

16:12.470 --> 16:14.510
And when I looked
into your records,

16:14.550 --> 16:16.690
it's what wasn't there
that caught my eye.

16:16.730 --> 16:19.300
There's a 14 month gap,
like a donut hole,

16:19.340 --> 16:20.780
right after graduate school.

16:20.820 --> 16:23.960
You know what takes 14 months?
Spy training.

16:25.130 --> 16:26.740
And then there's Tal,

16:26.780 --> 16:28.960
who has systematically
targeted the CIA

16:29.000 --> 16:31.270
every step of the way,
and now he's targeting you.

16:31.310 --> 16:33.790
There's no record of
your service with the agency.

16:33.830 --> 16:36.010
That can only mean one thing...

16:37.100 --> 16:38.880
You were black ops.

16:45.670 --> 16:47.630
- Excuse me.
- Can I help you?

16:47.670 --> 16:49.630
Yeah, uh, you the new owners?

16:49.680 --> 16:52.070
- No, realtors.
- Oh.

16:52.110 --> 16:53.550
Is someone going to buy
the place?

16:53.590 --> 16:54.990
It's been lying empty
for months.

16:55.030 --> 16:56.120
Hope so.

16:56.160 --> 16:59.300
- Is that true?
- Are you former CIA?

16:59.340 --> 17:00.770
Lives are at stake

17:00.820 --> 17:02.496
and you're withholding
critical information.

17:02.520 --> 17:04.536
Oh, you guys have been here
since the morning, huh?

17:04.560 --> 17:06.300
It's a late client.

17:06.349 --> 17:08.300
Wow, really late.

17:08.349 --> 17:09.960
Yeah, well, nice talking to you.

17:10.000 --> 17:11.089
You too.

17:11.130 --> 17:12.660
[gunshots

17:18.790 --> 17:21.010
We gotta move!

17:21.060 --> 17:23.010
You trust her with a gun?

17:23.060 --> 17:25.060
- I trust she wants to live.
- Let's go.

18:23.290 --> 18:25.210
Car's out back!
Let's go!

18:28.040 --> 18:29.340
This is Agent Keaton.

18:29.390 --> 18:30.666
We've just been attacked
at the safe house.

18:30.690 --> 18:32.390
We're headed back now.

18:34.480 --> 18:35.870
You said lives were at stake.

18:35.910 --> 18:37.390
What is Tal planning?

18:37.440 --> 18:39.180
A large-scale attack
on a tourist site.

18:39.220 --> 18:41.180
- Which one?
- We don't know which one

18:41.220 --> 18:43.180
and we don't know
when it's happening.

18:43.230 --> 18:45.710
Well, I can't help you
with the target.

18:45.750 --> 18:49.190
But I can tell you that if Tal
is planning an attack,

18:49.230 --> 18:50.880
he's gonna carry it out
tomorrow.

18:50.930 --> 18:52.760
Why?

18:52.800 --> 18:54.500
Because you were right.

18:54.540 --> 18:57.720
I spent six years doing
black ops for the CIA.

18:57.760 --> 19:00.550
Mostly Eastern Europe
and Russia.

19:00.590 --> 19:04.770
Look, there's something that
you need to know about Tal.

19:04.810 --> 19:06.200
About ten years ago,

19:06.250 --> 19:07.600
one of my assignments

19:07.640 --> 19:09.900
was handling off-book operations

19:09.950 --> 19:12.520
during the second
Chechen conflict.

19:12.560 --> 19:15.170
Tal had been in Russian
intelligence,

19:15.210 --> 19:17.220
but had recently left.

19:17.260 --> 19:18.740
We thought he might be in play

19:18.780 --> 19:20.416
so we bribed him to sell us
valuable intel

19:20.440 --> 19:23.180
about SVR operations in Grozny.

19:28.530 --> 19:30.580
In return for his cooperation,

19:30.620 --> 19:33.100
the CIA made certain
promises to Tal.

19:33.140 --> 19:36.410
The most important one was
that we would extract him

19:36.450 --> 19:38.240
and his brothers from Chechnya

19:38.280 --> 19:40.020
before everything got crazy
on the ground.

20:14.880 --> 20:19.450
- Tal's parents died young.
- His brothers were all he had.

20:19.500 --> 20:21.980
CIA didn't keep their end
of the bargain, did they?

20:22.020 --> 20:23.460
No.

20:23.500 --> 20:25.810
Someone in charge
decided that the agency

20:25.850 --> 20:28.240
had gotten everything
it needed from Tal.

20:28.290 --> 20:32.810
And that he and his brothers
were justifiable casualties.

20:32.860 --> 20:34.990
So we left them behind.

20:35.030 --> 20:38.040
And while Tal was waiting
for his contact to arrive,

20:38.080 --> 20:41.950
one of our airstrikes took out
both of his brothers.

20:48.650 --> 20:52.960
Tal's brothers were killed
and Tal blamed the CIA.

20:54.790 --> 20:58.660
He's not going to stop
until he has his revenge.

21:01.540 --> 21:04.320
The attack. How do you know
it's happening tomorrow?

21:04.370 --> 21:06.800
Because tomorrow is
the anniversary

21:06.850 --> 21:08.200
of his brothers' deaths.

21:25.130 --> 21:27.000
I was expecting Chigorin.

21:27.040 --> 21:30.000
- You're disappointed?
- No, no. Of course not.

21:30.040 --> 21:32.700
It's just that I thought
you'd be in Cuba by now.

21:32.740 --> 21:35.310
There are things here
that are too important.

21:37.010 --> 21:38.570
The congresswoman.

21:38.620 --> 21:41.490
Yes, she's still alive.

21:41.530 --> 21:43.320
I was informed.

21:44.540 --> 21:46.280
You never served
in the military,

21:46.320 --> 21:49.280
so I don't expect you
to understand

21:49.320 --> 21:51.370
the significance of an order.

21:51.410 --> 21:53.110
When given, it must be followed

21:53.150 --> 21:56.720
without excuse,
without exception.

21:56.770 --> 22:01.160
That is why when I ordered you
to remove Agent Keaton

22:01.210 --> 22:04.820
from the FBI investigation
into me...

22:06.380 --> 22:08.780
I expected it to be done.

22:09.950 --> 22:13.130
It will be. It is.

22:13.170 --> 22:14.740
When I served in Spetsnaz,

22:14.780 --> 22:18.400
do you know what would happen
when an order was not followed?

22:18.440 --> 22:20.530
Bell isn't important
to your plans.

22:20.570 --> 22:22.310
She can't do anything
to stop us.

22:22.360 --> 22:25.880
That woman means nothing.

22:25.930 --> 22:28.060
To me, she does.

22:39.330 --> 22:41.070
- You okay, Will?
- Yeah, I'm good.

22:41.110 --> 22:43.600
An attack on an FBI
safe house in broad daylight?

22:43.640 --> 22:44.810
What the hell is going on?

22:44.860 --> 22:46.510
You think Backus leaked
the location?

22:46.560 --> 22:48.430
It's the only explanation
I can think of.

22:48.470 --> 22:50.080
What did you get on him?

22:50.120 --> 22:52.950
My contact at Senate Intel
found a cluster of recent calls

22:53.000 --> 22:55.960
going from Backus to overseas
encrypted sat phones.

22:56.000 --> 22:58.326
So if he's communicating with
Tal, that's how he's doing it.

22:58.350 --> 22:59.790
Daniel?

22:59.830 --> 23:01.530
I did that search
into Backus's finances.

23:01.570 --> 23:03.286
Turns out he has a number
of offshore accounts

23:03.310 --> 23:05.180
in the Cayman Islands.

23:05.230 --> 23:06.466
And he just made a series
of deposits

23:06.490 --> 23:08.190
right under the U.S.
wire transfer limit.

23:08.230 --> 23:10.620
I think he's trying to avoid
being flagged by the Treasury.

23:10.670 --> 23:12.670
What about Bell?
Did she give you anything?

23:12.710 --> 23:14.970
Yeah, I did. But you guys
aren't going to believe it.

23:15.020 --> 23:17.280
She's former CIA.

23:17.320 --> 23:18.760
Bell is?

23:18.800 --> 23:20.656
She worked black ops in
Chechnya ten years ago.

23:20.680 --> 23:22.680
She also said that Backus
reached out to her office

23:22.720 --> 23:24.330
to check her travel schedule.

23:24.380 --> 23:26.030
Said he wanted to set a meeting,

23:26.070 --> 23:27.810
but I think he was planning
that hotel hit.

23:27.860 --> 23:30.290
If we're right, and Tal
has someone as highly placed

23:30.340 --> 23:31.640
as Backus in hand,

23:31.690 --> 23:33.650
imagine the damage he's done.

23:33.690 --> 23:35.470
We've got to arrest him now.

23:35.520 --> 23:37.560
Yeah, but we need hard proof.

23:37.610 --> 23:39.870
How are we gonna get that?

23:41.830 --> 23:45.180
We're going to run a false
flag operation on Backus.

23:45.220 --> 23:48.530
The plan is to leak information
to him about the location

23:48.570 --> 23:50.010
of Bell's meeting later today,

23:50.050 --> 23:52.530
as well as the route
she'll take to get there.

23:52.580 --> 23:55.540
If Backus is dirty, he'll
pass the information to Tal

23:55.580 --> 23:57.150
and Tal will attempt an attack.

23:57.190 --> 23:59.036
When he does, we'll have
the proof that we need,

23:59.060 --> 24:00.670
and we can arrest him
for conspiracy

24:00.720 --> 24:02.240
against the United States.

24:02.280 --> 24:04.240
- And what about Bell?
- You're using her as bait?

24:04.280 --> 24:05.500
No, it's too risky.

24:05.550 --> 24:06.656
We'll have a decoy in her place.

24:06.680 --> 24:08.160
For that to work,

24:08.200 --> 24:09.706
we're going to have
to tell Bell about Backus.

24:09.730 --> 24:13.250
- I know.
- Can we trust her with that?

24:13.290 --> 24:15.210
We don't have a choice.

24:15.250 --> 24:17.860
There's just one problem.

24:17.910 --> 24:19.340
What's that?

24:19.390 --> 24:22.560
If anyone working for Tal
finds up what you're up to,

24:22.610 --> 24:24.740
Backus will know
and you will lose

24:24.780 --> 24:27.220
your only chance to catch him.

24:27.260 --> 24:28.896
Which is exactly why
we need to be careful.

24:28.920 --> 24:33.880
Right. Like you
were at the safe house.

24:33.920 --> 24:36.060
So you don't want
to use a decoy?

24:36.100 --> 24:37.540
No.

24:37.580 --> 24:39.256
There's no way I'm going
to knowingly put you

24:39.280 --> 24:40.630
in that type of danger.

24:40.670 --> 24:44.280
It's an armored car,
Agent Keaton.

24:44.320 --> 24:46.980
Look, Tal has eyes everywhere.

24:47.020 --> 24:48.590
No one knows
that better than you.

24:48.630 --> 24:52.420
So if you want
to guarantee this works,

24:52.460 --> 24:53.746
you're going to have
to take risks.

24:53.770 --> 24:56.820
- Why are you doing this?
- It's my job...

24:56.860 --> 24:58.690
to protect America
and its citizens.

24:58.730 --> 25:00.730
I take my job seriously.

25:00.780 --> 25:03.520
Okay, you'll be in the vehicle.

25:03.560 --> 25:05.820
We leave in 30 minutes.

25:07.090 --> 25:09.960
And why are you doing this,
Shepherd?

25:11.180 --> 25:13.570
You seemed pretty sure
of your answer earlier today.

25:13.620 --> 25:15.140
And I stand by it.

25:15.180 --> 25:18.660
You're trying to make up
for the lives that you took.

25:18.710 --> 25:23.630
I see that clear as day,
but there's something else.

25:23.670 --> 25:26.370
Something that you
are trying really hard

25:26.410 --> 25:28.060
to keep the world from knowing.

25:28.110 --> 25:29.940
So what is it?

25:31.850 --> 25:34.200
You should get ready.

26:22.860 --> 26:26.120
We have a change of plans.

26:26.170 --> 26:27.510
Bragg and Pettigrew

26:27.560 --> 26:28.950
will be driving
the Congresswoman

26:28.990 --> 26:30.820
on the new route that
was leaked to Backus.

26:30.870 --> 26:32.560
If we're right about this,

26:32.610 --> 26:34.350
there will be an attack
on the vehicle.

26:34.390 --> 26:36.000
HRT's gonna be following.

26:36.050 --> 26:38.000
Loose reins ready to
tighten up on my command.

26:38.050 --> 26:39.920
Copy that.

26:40.700 --> 26:42.880
Agent Keaton.

26:42.920 --> 26:44.580
A word?

26:46.060 --> 26:49.010
- Everything okay?
- No.

26:49.060 --> 26:51.890
Someone on your team carried
out an illegal search

26:51.930 --> 26:53.540
into the
National Security Advisor.

26:53.580 --> 26:55.190
Must be a mistake.

26:55.240 --> 26:57.070
Special Agent Zain?

26:58.890 --> 27:00.810
Deputy Director Molinero.

27:00.850 --> 27:02.640
We have reason to believe
that you violated

27:02.680 --> 27:04.120
intelligence oversight rules

27:04.160 --> 27:05.770
when you carried out
a warrantless search

27:05.810 --> 27:07.690
into Paul Backus.

27:07.730 --> 27:10.820
Do you have
any evidence of this?

27:10.860 --> 27:13.040
We need to have a talk.

27:13.080 --> 27:15.430
Officers, place Agent Zain
under arrest.

27:15.480 --> 27:16.846
- Wait a minute.
- Hold on a second.

27:16.870 --> 27:18.586
- Stand down, Agent Keaton.
- That's an order.

27:18.610 --> 27:20.130
It's okay, Will.

27:20.180 --> 27:23.700
I'll answer any questions
the Deputy Director has for me.

27:40.330 --> 27:42.500
- What do we do?
- There's nothing we can do.

27:42.550 --> 27:44.370
But this is Daniel
we're talking about.

27:44.420 --> 27:46.396
Any one of us interferes
with Molinero's investigation,

27:46.420 --> 27:47.876
we'll be guilty of
obstructing justice.

27:47.900 --> 27:49.576
As much as I don't like it,
we have to let it play out.

27:49.600 --> 27:51.136
Will Daniel say that
you suspect Backus?

27:51.160 --> 27:52.510
No, he won't.

27:52.560 --> 27:53.886
He's been suspicious
of your methods

27:53.910 --> 27:55.390
ever since I got here.

27:55.430 --> 27:57.016
He thinks I've been
a bad influence on you.

27:57.040 --> 27:59.170
Considering what just
happened, maybe he was right.

27:59.220 --> 28:00.520
Daniel wouldn't do anything

28:00.560 --> 28:02.310
to disrupt the investigation,
would he?

28:02.350 --> 28:04.496
We're talking about a man's
career. His future at the FBI.

28:04.520 --> 28:06.416
How far do you think he'll go
to protect your secret?

28:06.440 --> 28:08.530
If we're not successful
at this operation today,

28:08.570 --> 28:12.050
none of us will have a future.
At least not at the FBI anyway.

28:12.100 --> 28:13.750
Listen, the plan remains
the same.

28:13.800 --> 28:15.230
We're going to put
the Congresswoman

28:15.270 --> 28:16.970
in a transport vehicle
as the target.

28:17.020 --> 28:19.450
I'm gonna post up with a team
right outside Backus's house.

28:19.500 --> 28:21.086
If this confirms that
he's working with Tal,

28:21.110 --> 28:22.760
I'll be right there
to arrest him.

28:22.800 --> 28:27.200
We're in this all the way.
Now more than ever.

28:27.240 --> 28:29.250
Get back to work.

28:35.470 --> 28:37.780
Cointel One. Radio check.

28:37.820 --> 28:40.130
Heading out
on the designated route.

28:40.170 --> 28:42.480
- Copy that.
- Constant communication.

28:42.520 --> 28:45.260
Anything out of the ordinary,
you let us know.

28:48.830 --> 28:50.440
So Congresswoman,

28:50.480 --> 28:52.700
how long were you working
black ops for the CIA?

28:52.750 --> 28:54.790
Six years.

28:54.840 --> 28:56.620
How'd you like that?

28:56.660 --> 28:59.540
It could be exhilarating
at times.

28:59.580 --> 29:00.800
Knowing that you were a part

29:00.840 --> 29:02.450
of something bigger
than yourself.

29:02.500 --> 29:04.500
Other times, it was harder.

29:05.670 --> 29:08.280
Your identity
and what you were working on

29:08.330 --> 29:09.810
had to remain a secret.

29:09.850 --> 29:13.290
So sometimes that meant
you had to pretend to be

29:13.330 --> 29:15.900
someone other people
didn't like.

29:16.990 --> 29:18.950
A liar, a thief,

29:18.990 --> 29:22.650
criminal, traitor.

29:22.690 --> 29:24.130
Sometimes you had to endure

29:24.170 --> 29:26.650
the scorn of people
you respected.

29:26.690 --> 29:28.300
Even while you were
risking your life

29:28.350 --> 29:30.310
to protect your country.

29:32.530 --> 29:34.010
Cointel One, we're coming up on

29:34.050 --> 29:35.920
- the Water Street overpass now.
- Stay alert.

29:35.960 --> 29:38.530
If anything's gonna happen,
it's gonna happen right there.

29:46.500 --> 29:48.150
Bragg, you see anything yet?

29:48.190 --> 29:49.850
All clear.

30:00.030 --> 30:02.430
Spike strip! Hold on!

30:06.210 --> 30:07.560
All units, we're under attack.

30:07.600 --> 30:09.210
We're under attack!
Move! Move!

30:09.260 --> 30:10.870
HRT, go! Go!

30:10.910 --> 30:12.480
Surround them!

30:16.570 --> 30:19.180
- On the ground!
- On the ground!

30:19.220 --> 30:21.440
- Your weapons! Drop them!
- Now! Go!

30:27.020 --> 30:29.370
On the ground!

30:36.330 --> 30:37.680
Bragg, Pettigrew, you okay?

30:37.720 --> 30:40.550
- Yeah, we're good.
- Bell's safe.

30:40.590 --> 30:43.730
The assailants have been
neutralized. We're good.

30:43.770 --> 30:45.900
All right,
I'm moving in on Backus.

30:53.080 --> 30:54.080
God.

31:06.490 --> 31:08.140
Hands behind your back.

31:08.190 --> 31:11.970
I can't believe Tal got to
the National Security Advisor.

31:12.020 --> 31:14.580
I can.

31:14.630 --> 31:17.720
Have you heard from Daniel?

31:17.760 --> 31:19.240
Not yet.

31:19.280 --> 31:20.940
They're going
to question him, Will.

31:20.980 --> 31:25.550
And they're going to ask if you
ordered him to run that search.

31:25.600 --> 31:28.340
What do you think
he's going to say?

31:28.380 --> 31:30.470
Daniel will do the right thing.

31:30.510 --> 31:32.910
He always does.

31:40.220 --> 31:43.220
That attack that Tal
is planning.

31:43.270 --> 31:45.700
What's the target?

31:47.100 --> 31:51.580
I want a guarantee that I
won't spend any time in prison.

31:51.620 --> 31:53.800
You're in no position
to negotiate.

31:53.840 --> 31:56.150
The best you can hope for
right now is mercy.

31:56.190 --> 31:58.980
Tal's going after a popular
tourist site here in D.C.

31:59.020 --> 32:00.460
Which one is it?

32:00.500 --> 32:02.306
- This is a waste of time.
- You won't stop him.

32:02.330 --> 32:03.590
No one will.

32:03.630 --> 32:05.290
I asked you a question.

32:13.730 --> 32:16.080
Every day,
close to 100,000 people

32:16.120 --> 32:18.430
pass through Union Station.

32:20.780 --> 32:23.480
It's not the place
Tal wants to destroy.

32:23.520 --> 32:26.350
It's the people inside it.

32:27.480 --> 32:30.050
I want to know what
Tal's planning to carry out.

32:30.090 --> 32:31.750
Who he's working with.

32:31.790 --> 32:35.580
And I want to know what exactly
your involvement is.

32:38.320 --> 32:40.630
You got a pen?

32:41.670 --> 32:43.670
This doesn't need to take long.

32:43.720 --> 32:45.020
I want you to write a statement

32:45.070 --> 32:47.070
detailing the truth
of what happened.

32:47.110 --> 32:51.160
Today's arrest doesn't change
the fact that Agent Keaton

32:51.200 --> 32:53.160
ordered you to perform
an illegal search

32:53.200 --> 32:56.820
into the National Security
Advisor, Paul Backus.

32:56.860 --> 32:58.690
Agent Keaton did nothing wrong.

32:58.730 --> 33:01.690
I performed the search
on my own.

33:01.730 --> 33:03.950
Do you really want to do this?

33:04.000 --> 33:05.740
Do you really want to fall
on your sword

33:05.780 --> 33:07.716
for someone who has abandoned
all of the principles

33:07.740 --> 33:09.870
that you and I stand for?

33:09.920 --> 33:13.090
This is your career, Agent Zain.

33:13.140 --> 33:14.790
Tell me the truth.

33:14.830 --> 33:16.180
I just did.

33:16.230 --> 33:19.450
- You're making a mistake.
- No, you are.

33:19.490 --> 33:21.450
With respect, Deputy Director,

33:21.490 --> 33:23.670
it's your career too.

33:23.710 --> 33:26.370
Tal is planning an attack
as we speak.

33:26.410 --> 33:30.070
He'll cause casualties on a
scale we've never seen before,

33:30.110 --> 33:32.500
and you're wasting precious
time making accusations

33:32.550 --> 33:33.956
against the one man
who could stop him.

33:33.980 --> 33:37.070
I'll ask you again, Agent Zain.

33:37.120 --> 33:41.820
Did Keaton order you
to perform the search?

33:43.080 --> 33:44.950
No.

33:45.950 --> 33:48.090
I'll need your badge
and credentials.

33:48.130 --> 33:52.310
Effectively immediately, you're
suspended from the Bureau

33:52.350 --> 33:55.530
while we move forward with
the internal investigation.

34:04.620 --> 34:06.930
I hope it's worth it.

34:20.469 --> 34:22.900
So this is where they keep ya.

34:22.949 --> 34:24.690
For now.

34:25.860 --> 34:27.520
Is that your daughter?

34:28.949 --> 34:30.480
It is.

34:30.520 --> 34:32.090
She's beautiful.

34:33.909 --> 34:36.090
How old is she?

34:37.000 --> 34:38.659
Almost 16.

34:38.699 --> 34:43.010
- So what would make her, what?
- 12 when you got arrested.

34:44.139 --> 34:48.580
I worked a mission
in Lithuania many years ago.

34:48.620 --> 34:51.889
I was trying to turn
a former FSB Agent.

34:51.929 --> 34:53.760
I tried for months.

34:53.800 --> 34:57.110
No matter what I offered,
he wouldn't play ball.

34:57.150 --> 34:59.240
Well, one day, I had an idea.

34:59.290 --> 35:03.990
He was a father
to two little boys.

35:04.030 --> 35:06.990
They lived in a rough area
of the city.

35:07.030 --> 35:10.950
So I put a protective detail
around the kids.

35:10.990 --> 35:14.130
He started cooperating
the next day.

35:15.740 --> 35:18.260
Now, I learned
something that day,

35:18.310 --> 35:19.870
'cause I don't have kids,

35:19.920 --> 35:22.790
but parents will
do almost anything

35:22.830 --> 35:24.660
to protect their children.

35:27.530 --> 35:29.670
Right?

35:33.020 --> 35:35.150
Goodbye, Erica.

35:54.340 --> 35:55.950
Tal.

35:56.000 --> 35:57.650
Chigorin.

35:57.690 --> 35:59.960
It's good to see you,
my friend. Are you well?

36:00.000 --> 36:02.000
I will be.

36:02.050 --> 36:03.310
Backus has been arrested

36:03.350 --> 36:05.090
and the congresswoman
is still alive.

36:05.140 --> 36:07.310
I'm sorry. I know what
she meant to you.

36:07.360 --> 36:10.580
There will be time for her,
but not now.

36:10.620 --> 36:13.670
The moment we've been planning
for is finally here.

36:13.710 --> 36:16.190
My team's in Washington
awaiting your orders.

36:16.230 --> 36:19.930
- Good. Come.
- Tomorrow, we change the world.

36:25.810 --> 36:27.510
We're locking down
Union Station tonight.

36:27.550 --> 36:30.120
We'll have agents on site
all day tomorrow.

36:30.160 --> 36:32.340
When Tal strikes,
we're gonna be ready.

36:32.380 --> 36:33.950
Is that enough?

36:33.990 --> 36:36.120
We'll see.

36:38.560 --> 36:41.260
When I first came here, you
said there was no redemption

36:41.300 --> 36:44.040
for someone like me.

36:44.090 --> 36:46.180
Do you still believe that?

36:46.220 --> 36:48.220
Yes.

36:49.700 --> 36:51.400
But I hope I'm wrong.

36:54.710 --> 37:00.100
Tomorrow's attack. Cuba.
This is Tal's endgame.

37:00.150 --> 37:03.150
Either he stops us
or we stop him.

37:04.410 --> 37:07.240
I need to know
you're with me on this.

37:09.070 --> 37:11.160
Absolutely.

37:12.770 --> 37:15.290
There's something
I need to do first.

37:25.350 --> 37:28.090
What are you doing here?

37:28.130 --> 37:30.310
I need to see Hannah.

37:31.270 --> 37:34.090
- No, no.
- Look, we talked about this.

37:34.140 --> 37:36.710
Chris...

37:36.750 --> 37:38.750
in all of my years
of working intelligence,

37:38.790 --> 37:41.010
I was never able to tell you
where I was going

37:41.060 --> 37:42.410
when I was going on a trip.

37:42.450 --> 37:44.930
- I remember.
- But you knew me so well.

37:44.970 --> 37:48.150
You knew when I was going
somewhere dangerous.

37:48.190 --> 37:51.590
Somewhere I might
never come back from.

37:51.630 --> 37:55.510
This is one of those times.
I need to see Hannah.

38:30.980 --> 38:34.680
You're here. How?

38:35.370 --> 38:39.160
Your dad asked me
exactly the same question.

38:39.200 --> 38:41.640
How long can you stay?

38:42.990 --> 38:45.250
Not long.

38:52.610 --> 38:54.480
Uh, they call it Algebra II

38:54.520 --> 38:57.480
but it's actually
much harder than one.

38:57.530 --> 39:01.360
Exponentially,
as my teacher would say.

39:01.400 --> 39:03.710
What about your music?

39:03.750 --> 39:07.670
It's going well. I'm
doing a theory class now too.

39:10.580 --> 39:13.450
You're really lucky that
you found something you love.

39:13.500 --> 39:15.760
You know, you should
never stop doing it.

39:23.250 --> 39:27.250
What is it, Mom?

39:32.390 --> 39:34.740
I made a lot of choices
in my life.

39:37.090 --> 39:40.390
And some of them have really
hurt you and your dad

39:40.440 --> 39:42.400
and other people.

39:42.440 --> 39:45.960
But I think
it's really important...

39:46.010 --> 39:49.400
that I tell you about the best
decision I've ever made.

39:49.450 --> 39:51.750
Do you know what it is?

39:51.800 --> 39:53.970
What?

39:54.020 --> 39:56.280
You.

39:59.280 --> 40:01.850
Being your mom.

40:03.590 --> 40:05.720
I've always been
a very decisive person,

40:05.770 --> 40:09.600
so I would make a decision
and I would never look back.

40:09.640 --> 40:14.910
When... when I was training
at the CIA, um...

40:14.950 --> 40:16.910
We would do this exercise
where we would all have

40:16.950 --> 40:18.130
to jump out of an airplane.

40:18.170 --> 40:20.170
- Really?
- Yes.

40:20.220 --> 40:21.480
It's not that bad.

40:21.520 --> 40:23.570
But the instructor,

40:23.610 --> 40:25.570
every time would ask
for a volunteer.

40:25.610 --> 40:28.010
And my hand would shoot
into the sky

40:28.050 --> 40:29.920
before I was even aware of it.

40:29.970 --> 40:31.620
That sounds right.

40:31.660 --> 40:34.100
But...

40:35.750 --> 40:37.516
Later when I found out
that I was going to have

40:37.540 --> 40:39.320
a little girl, Hannah...

40:41.240 --> 40:43.460
I met fear.

40:45.550 --> 40:48.590
What kind of mother would I be?

40:48.640 --> 40:50.990
How was I going to protect you?

40:51.030 --> 40:52.510
I had no control.

40:52.550 --> 40:55.120
I was terrified.

40:57.600 --> 40:59.560
You...

41:00.820 --> 41:03.650
Were so eager to take
your place in the world

41:03.690 --> 41:06.520
that you were born before
the doctor even made it

41:06.570 --> 41:08.260
into the delivery room.

41:10.350 --> 41:12.880
For 16 years,

41:12.920 --> 41:15.790
you have taught me time
and time again,

41:15.840 --> 41:19.800
you will succeed at whatever
you put your heart to.

41:21.630 --> 41:24.930
I may not always
be there to see it.

41:24.980 --> 41:27.890
But woman...

41:27.940 --> 41:30.330
I feel it.

41:35.030 --> 41:36.600
Mom.

41:43.210 --> 41:45.560
I love you.

41:45.610 --> 41:48.350
I love you too.

42:07.240 --> 42:08.930
You okay?

42:16.940 --> 42:18.990
Let's end this.
