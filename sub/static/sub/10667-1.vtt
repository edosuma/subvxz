WEBVTT

01:26.487 --> 01:28.789
The Starlight Nightclub!

01:28.822 --> 01:31.159
You'll never find a more
wretched

01:31.192 --> 01:34.228
hive of scum and villainy.

01:34.262 --> 01:36.230
My kind of place. Yeah!

01:36.464 --> 01:37.665
These guys?

01:37.698 --> 01:40.168
If you are looking
for the smartest, toughest,

01:40.201 --> 01:42.470
craftiest bunch
of cats in the world...

01:42.936 --> 01:44.138
keep looking.

01:44.372 --> 01:45.806
But... like it or not,

01:45.839 --> 01:48.576
they're my crew, Top Cat's crew.

01:51.945 --> 01:53.447
Keep it together, boys.

01:53.647 --> 01:55.683
This is a rescue mission,
remember?

02:33.754 --> 02:35.723
What is the meaning
of this outrage?

02:35.989 --> 02:37.925
I'm finding
traces of bacteria, sir!

02:38.492 --> 02:40.661
And A, B, C and D Coli!

02:41.662 --> 02:43.297
Check out this muffin!

02:43.331 --> 02:45.499
I don't think those are raisins.

02:45.533 --> 02:47.735
This place is
haunted with ghosts.

02:48.001 --> 02:50.204
And they've
been sneezing on the food!

02:50.238 --> 02:51.805
Oh, ghost germs!

02:52.005 --> 02:53.841
The worst kind!

02:53.874 --> 02:55.776
If you do not
leave this instant,

02:55.809 --> 02:57.345
I'm calling the police!

02:57.378 --> 02:58.412
My good man,

02:58.446 --> 03:01.482
I am Federal Health Inspector,
Felix Snagglepuss!

03:01.749 --> 03:03.551
I outrank the police.

03:03.584 --> 03:05.986
Is this badge made of cheese?

03:06.019 --> 03:07.521
Oww!

03:07.555 --> 03:09.390
Of course not!
With all the violations,

03:09.423 --> 03:10.758
it's a miracle people
don't explode

03:10.791 --> 03:12.626
on contact with your food.

03:12.660 --> 03:15.496
I had to give you
a health rating of...

03:15.829 --> 03:17.865
Z. Z minus!

03:17.898 --> 03:19.767
What? No, no!

03:19.800 --> 03:23.704
Sure Mr. Snagglepuss, the things
you found will be fixed,

03:23.737 --> 03:27.308
if you delay this finding
for just a few days.

03:27.341 --> 03:31.679
Yes, I'd like to, but we must
return to Washington now.

03:31.712 --> 03:35.416
And staying one more day
in New York is quite expensive,

03:35.449 --> 03:37.651
if you know what I mean.

03:39.853 --> 03:42.222
-This is where you bribe me.
-But of course!

03:42.490 --> 03:44.358
Monsieur Snagglepuss,

03:44.392 --> 03:47.961
you seem to have dropped
"this" five thousand dollars!

03:48.396 --> 03:51.699
And "this" five thousand...
Twenty?

03:51.999 --> 03:54.468
"This" twenty thousand dollars!

03:54.502 --> 03:56.036
Ahh, now, we're talking.

03:56.069 --> 03:58.706
Make it a good hundred thou
and we're good.

03:58.739 --> 04:01.942
But Monsieur! I do not have
access to that much money!

04:01.975 --> 04:03.977
In that case,
thank you for your time.

04:04.011 --> 04:07.581
-You had a lovely place here.
-No! It's-- it's-- it's--

04:07.615 --> 04:08.882
it's a misunderstanding.

04:08.916 --> 04:11.985
You will have it,
but it must come from...

04:12.453 --> 04:13.687
Mr. Big.

04:13.721 --> 04:15.556
Mr. Big? Mr. Big you say?

04:15.589 --> 04:17.658
Shhhh!
His name must never be spoken.

04:17.690 --> 04:21.762
-But it was you who said Mr...
-Shhhh. Okay, go to him.

04:24.131 --> 04:27.301
The private elevator to his
basement office is just there.

04:27.335 --> 04:29.303
I'll let him know
you're coming down.

04:37.878 --> 04:39.813
I'm sorry to disturb you, sir.

04:39.847 --> 04:41.349
We have, uh...

04:41.382 --> 04:43.451
une petit situation.

04:43.884 --> 04:45.018
I hate

04:45.052 --> 04:46.687
situations.

04:47.355 --> 04:49.657
Do you know what I did
to the last guy

04:49.690 --> 04:52.760
who told me we had a situation?

04:56.964 --> 04:59.567
Help me!

05:06.474 --> 05:08.942
It's about the Health Inspector.

05:08.976 --> 05:10.344
He's headed up to you.

05:10.378 --> 05:11.712
He says he'll shut us down

05:11.745 --> 05:13.814
if you don't give him a
hundred thousand.

05:13.847 --> 05:18.085
That's not the health inspector,
you idiot.

05:18.118 --> 05:19.353
How you know this?

05:19.587 --> 05:20.854
Because...

05:21.489 --> 05:24.492
I'm paying off
the health inspector

05:24.525 --> 05:27.027
-right now!

05:28.095 --> 05:31.465
Although,
now that I think of it...

05:31.499 --> 05:32.800
-Oh? What?

05:32.833 --> 05:34.001
Oh.

05:37.771 --> 05:39.707
I'll send someone
to beat you up.

05:39.973 --> 05:41.341
No, wait!

05:42.576 --> 05:44.645
I need my goons to take care
of the fake health inspector.

05:44.678 --> 05:47.080
You'll have to beat yourself up.

05:47.648 --> 05:48.782
Pardonnez-moi?

05:48.816 --> 05:50.050
Do it!

05:51.852 --> 05:53.454
Oh, ow!

06:11.138 --> 06:12.773
Hey Top Cat,

06:12.806 --> 06:17.678
these guys must be getting
bribed by Mr. Big just like us.

06:17.711 --> 06:19.179
Brain, my friend.

06:19.212 --> 06:20.981
These gentlemen here are goons

06:21.014 --> 06:23.116
who want to beat
the living days out of us!

06:23.150 --> 06:25.786
We don't want to, we're paid to.

06:25.986 --> 06:28.722
I want to.
Ahm, we're getting paid?

06:28.756 --> 06:30.924
-Well in that case...

06:31.525 --> 06:33.060
Cheese it, boys!

06:44.805 --> 06:46.740
Whoa! Sorry.

07:03.791 --> 07:04.858
Follow me.

07:19.907 --> 07:22.209
What about the
rescue mission, TC?

07:22.242 --> 07:23.811
Ah, what mission?

07:23.844 --> 07:26.547
Mmmh, a tactical retreat.

07:26.947 --> 07:28.549
Now, now, this way.

07:32.052 --> 07:33.621
This way to freedom!

07:50.103 --> 07:53.607
Looks like you cats
are in a real predicament.

07:53.641 --> 07:56.644
And ain't nobody can
get you out of it but this cat.

07:58.078 --> 07:59.880
Pull us up! Please!

07:59.913 --> 08:01.248
I don't want to die.

08:01.281 --> 08:03.150
Please, we're desperate!

08:03.183 --> 08:06.086
No we are not.
But even so you could help us.

08:06.119 --> 08:09.089
Because we are nice
and you are nicer.

08:09.122 --> 08:11.525
Not because we're desperate.
Because we're not.

08:13.561 --> 08:15.095
Okay, okay, I lied, I lied!

08:15.128 --> 08:16.964
We are desperate, please help!

08:16.997 --> 08:20.000
Err... Why should I stick
my neck out for you?

08:21.034 --> 08:23.737
I used to be just like this guy.

08:28.742 --> 08:32.546
I was new to the city and trying
to make an honest living.

09:06.814 --> 09:08.916
Excuse me my fine feline,

09:08.949 --> 09:10.618
what is it
you're attempting to do?

09:10.651 --> 09:14.588
Well, times are tough at home.
My ma works a dozen jobs.

09:14.622 --> 09:17.257
I wanted to bring some
extra dough to buy some food.

09:17.290 --> 09:19.159
A fine sentiment.

09:19.192 --> 09:21.161
What did you say your name was?

09:21.194 --> 09:22.663
My name's Benny!

09:22.696 --> 09:24.832
But everybody calls me
"Hey you!"

09:24.865 --> 09:26.767
or "Get out of my sight!"

09:26.800 --> 09:30.971
Pleased to meet you, Benny.
You can call me Top Cat.

09:32.740 --> 09:34.141
There should be music
when I say that.

09:34.174 --> 09:35.609
Trumpets, shouldn't there
be trumpets?

09:35.809 --> 09:37.377
I only got a violin.

09:37.410 --> 09:39.947
Well Benny, I'm afraid
that unless you and your mum

09:39.980 --> 09:42.082
fancy eating
some wood and some strings,

09:42.115 --> 09:44.752
this violin is not going
to stop your hunger.

09:44.785 --> 09:45.753
It isn't?

09:45.786 --> 09:48.221
But no worries,
you are in luck.

09:48.255 --> 09:49.356
Am I?

09:49.389 --> 09:52.592
Yes, because you have
just met me!

09:53.126 --> 09:55.763
And, if it's good for business,

09:55.796 --> 09:58.098
you might consider
taking in a partner.

09:58.131 --> 09:59.166
-In other words,

09:59.199 --> 10:00.333
never work hard,

10:00.367 --> 10:03.971
if you can get some poor shmuck
to do it for you.

10:15.182 --> 10:16.984
That was amazing!

10:17.017 --> 10:18.652
We are rich!

10:18.686 --> 10:21.321
My financial ambitions
are a little higher than this.

10:21.354 --> 10:23.423
But it wasn't bad.

10:23.456 --> 10:26.626
Dare I say we even had...a ball?

10:27.060 --> 10:29.329
And since you were part of that,
I dub thee Ball,

10:29.730 --> 10:30.964
Benny the ball.

10:30.998 --> 10:33.000
Oh, do you say "Benny the Ball"

10:33.033 --> 10:35.703
because I'm fat
and I look like a ball?

10:36.436 --> 10:37.771
I like it!

10:37.805 --> 10:39.372
Now to divide this money up
evenly,

10:39.406 --> 10:41.008
this is yours.

10:41.041 --> 10:42.943
And after my commission,
my agent's fee,

10:42.976 --> 10:45.779
sidewalk tax, violin license
and string tariff...

10:45.813 --> 10:47.347
Yay, thanks!

10:47.380 --> 10:50.017
You're a true friend!

10:53.253 --> 10:55.288
Take it. It's yours now.

10:56.456 --> 10:58.191
Dapper, thank you.

10:58.491 --> 11:00.894
So, now that we're friends
and all,

11:00.928 --> 11:02.963
I want you
to come for dinner with my ma.

11:03.196 --> 11:06.266
Oh, you're sweet kid,
but truth to be told,

11:06.299 --> 11:08.401
the only true friend
I seek is money.

11:08.435 --> 11:09.636
-It's not you,

11:09.669 --> 11:12.740
it's just that I'm ambitious
and have vision and you don't.

11:12.773 --> 11:14.041
Oh, I see.

11:19.012 --> 11:21.348
Ha ha, of course, none of this
is an impediment for you, me,

11:21.381 --> 11:24.117
and this delightful mother
of yours having dinner together.

11:24.151 --> 11:25.719
-Let's go!

11:32.259 --> 11:33.727
-Oh!

11:37.064 --> 11:40.333
Whoa, whoa, whoa, who put
rocket fuel in your juice boxes?

11:40.367 --> 11:43.303
-Let go! We've got to...
- Aha!

11:51.544 --> 11:53.747
Caught you two,
little tiger drafts!

11:53.781 --> 11:55.382
Officer! What is the problem?

11:55.415 --> 11:58.518
These two cat burglars
just robbed a bakery!

11:58.551 --> 12:02.289
Why that's impossible!
These upstanding youths

12:02.322 --> 12:05.458
have being showing my companion
and me around the city all day.

12:05.492 --> 12:07.327
Isn't that true Benny?

12:07.360 --> 12:09.029
don't know what's happening.

12:09.229 --> 12:11.131
They haven't left our sight
for a moment.

12:11.164 --> 12:12.866
In fact, I was just
getting ready

12:13.066 --> 12:14.868
to compensate them
for their trouble.

12:14.902 --> 12:17.237
Eh... thank you, mister!

12:17.270 --> 12:19.773
Well, I guess I...

12:19.973 --> 12:21.174
My mistake.

12:21.374 --> 12:22.910
Apologies, boys.

12:26.847 --> 12:29.983
-What is wrong with you?
-We're underprivileged?

12:30.017 --> 12:32.820
No, I mean why would you steal?

12:32.853 --> 12:35.522
When there are so many suckers
who'll just give it away?

12:37.124 --> 12:39.192
Cheshire Tom with the
New York Tourism Bureau.

12:39.226 --> 12:40.060
The fee for staring at the

12:40.093 --> 12:42.129
Empire State Building
is five dollars.

12:42.495 --> 12:44.064
You see?

12:44.097 --> 12:46.533
We've got to steal
stealable things.

12:46.566 --> 12:49.402
If we don't, he'll burn down
the orphanage we live in.

12:49.436 --> 12:50.938
Who will?

12:52.172 --> 12:55.408
The strongest, roughest, bad,
baddest tough guy there is.

12:55.442 --> 12:57.945
-They call him...

13:01.081 --> 13:02.850
Bad Dog!

13:02.883 --> 13:04.284
Here he comes now!

13:04.317 --> 13:05.285
Please, Mister,

13:05.318 --> 13:08.021
we've got to give the loot to
Bad Dog or else!

13:08.055 --> 13:09.990
Charity for the poor. Oh!

13:23.136 --> 13:25.138
Listen here, my canine buddy,

13:25.338 --> 13:28.008
there's no need to be harsh
on this poor--

13:32.312 --> 13:34.014
Are you okay, mister?

13:34.547 --> 13:36.316
Bad Dog, indeed.

13:42.589 --> 13:46.493
We're so glad you could join us
for dinner, Top Cat.

13:47.527 --> 13:50.898
One more minute, though.
What did you say you do?

13:50.931 --> 13:52.365
Oh, a little of this...

13:52.399 --> 13:53.600
No!

13:54.935 --> 13:56.036
Help!

13:56.069 --> 13:58.038
Ma, on the count of three!

13:58.238 --> 14:00.941
-One, two...

14:02.642 --> 14:04.111
The sofa.

14:04.311 --> 14:06.146
-He tried to eat me!

14:06.179 --> 14:10.417
Yes, yes, we here not the only
hungry ones here!

14:10.450 --> 14:14.521
Oh, I'm sorry, this house is
as old as its owner.

14:14.922 --> 14:16.189
Let's just eat!

14:16.223 --> 14:18.091
Yes please.

14:18.125 --> 14:20.994
I can't wait to try
your tasteful...

14:21.394 --> 14:23.130
eh... stew.

14:23.163 --> 14:26.166
Wow! We got some orange peels.

14:27.300 --> 14:29.236
And real eggshells!

14:29.269 --> 14:31.471
Can we afford all this, ma?

14:31.504 --> 14:33.907
Only the best for company.

14:36.143 --> 14:38.078
Benny says you're a busy woman.

14:38.111 --> 14:40.047
What exactly do you do, Mrs. B?

14:40.080 --> 14:43.216
Oh, I take in a little laundry,
do a little sewing.

14:43.250 --> 14:44.484
That's nice--

14:45.718 --> 14:47.620
Make decorative cat collars,
fix taxi meters, tune pianos,

14:47.654 --> 14:50.323
calibrate x-ray equipment,
write user manuals,

14:50.357 --> 14:51.324
proofread textbooks.

14:51.358 --> 14:52.559
Okay, eh...

14:52.592 --> 14:56.329
And make puppets
out of dryer lint.

14:56.363 --> 14:59.532
Oooh, you very handsome!

14:59.566 --> 15:02.402
I'll go get us some
used dishwater to drink.

15:03.170 --> 15:05.605
Benny, if you and I are gonna
do business together,

15:05.638 --> 15:07.407
you must change your habits.

15:07.440 --> 15:10.277
We are cats
with expensive tastes.

15:10.310 --> 15:13.213
We? I thought you said
you didn't want me along.

15:13.246 --> 15:15.648
I said I didn't want
any friends.

15:16.049 --> 15:18.385
I didn't say anything
about partners.

15:18.418 --> 15:19.987
And that's me?

15:20.020 --> 15:21.221
Indubitably!

15:21.254 --> 15:23.323
Benny, I think
this is the beginning

15:23.356 --> 15:25.592
of a beautiful partnership.

16:14.241 --> 16:15.675
Dibble, get in here!

16:20.047 --> 16:22.582
I've been hearing good things
about you, Officer Dibble.

16:22.782 --> 16:26.486
Sir, you can't listen
to a bunch of gossip about...

16:26.819 --> 16:28.621
Wait, good things?

16:28.655 --> 16:30.790
I'm giving you a promotion!

16:30.823 --> 16:32.592
Oh, thank you, sir!

16:32.625 --> 16:36.429
I can't wait to tell my granny,
she'll be so proud of me.

16:36.463 --> 16:38.631
-Maybe? For once.
-Okay, now listen.

16:38.665 --> 16:42.135
I'm giving you the blocks
around Hoagie's Alley.

16:42.169 --> 16:43.336
Yeah, that's right.

16:44.504 --> 16:46.606
There's been a recent surge
in cat-related shenanigans

16:46.639 --> 16:48.608
and I need an officer
I can trust.

16:48.641 --> 16:53.146
B-- b-- but, but, but, sir
that area belongs to...

16:53.180 --> 16:55.215
Mr. Big!

16:55.248 --> 16:57.084
Well, if that's the way
you feel about it...

16:57.117 --> 16:59.219
Send in Officer Lopez!

17:01.388 --> 17:02.522
Hi, there!

17:03.723 --> 17:04.557
I've been hearing good things
about you, Officer Lopez.

17:04.590 --> 17:07.359
I'm giving you
the Hoagie's Alley beat.

17:07.394 --> 17:08.661
Don't thank me yet.

17:08.694 --> 17:11.131
True, it's on Mr. Big's turf,
but...

17:17.404 --> 17:19.172
Well, Dibble,

17:19.406 --> 17:22.342
it looks like you're
the man for the job after all.

17:22.375 --> 17:23.643
Congratulations.

17:25.278 --> 17:28.515
You really are a genius,
Top Cat. You know that?

17:28.548 --> 17:31.484
Yes, I do, Benny.
Yes, I very much do.

17:31.518 --> 17:33.253
You know? I just have
an instinct

17:33.286 --> 17:35.122
about what doorbell to ring.

17:35.155 --> 17:36.623
Like I can always tell...

17:36.656 --> 17:38.458
-...where the perfect sucker is.

17:39.426 --> 17:40.660
Delivery!

17:41.928 --> 17:43.396
You're the mind-blowing winner
of a glowy and goldy something

17:43.430 --> 17:44.097
Cop!

17:44.131 --> 17:46.133
Wow! I wonder what it could be?

17:46.166 --> 17:48.101
Nothing! It's nothing!

17:48.135 --> 17:49.502
It's wrong address.

17:49.736 --> 17:51.138
Wait a second!

17:51.171 --> 17:53.306
You're those scam cats
the chief told me about.

17:53.573 --> 17:54.741
Cheese it!

17:58.378 --> 18:00.247
"Cheese it" means run!

18:01.214 --> 18:02.649
Come back here!

18:33.780 --> 18:34.781
Wha--

18:39.586 --> 18:41.254
-Scoop of strawberry, please.

18:41.288 --> 18:42.489
Benny?

18:42.522 --> 18:43.923
Ooh, chocolate!

18:46.559 --> 18:47.527
You two!

18:47.560 --> 18:50.530
Don't just stand there.
Pay the man, would you?

18:50.563 --> 18:52.832
-Oh, of course. Sorry.

18:53.300 --> 18:56.503
-I like this cop.
-Me too, Top Cat.

18:56.536 --> 18:57.670
Mmm!

18:58.371 --> 18:59.372
Shall we?

18:59.972 --> 19:01.241
Whoa...

19:33.005 --> 19:35.275
That was a close call.

19:35.308 --> 19:36.509
Oh, nonsense,

19:36.543 --> 19:37.977
he never stood a chance.

19:38.010 --> 19:39.946
We make a great team.

19:41.348 --> 19:44.451
Gentlemen, lady, so nice to-

19:44.484 --> 19:45.818
Cut the chitchat, cat.

19:46.253 --> 19:48.521
Ha! Say that five times fast.

19:48.555 --> 19:50.590
Chitchat cat! Chitchat cat!
Chit-chack--

19:50.623 --> 19:53.493
Stop making
noises from the mouth hole!

19:53.526 --> 19:55.728
Couldn't help but notice
a yellow cat just like you

19:55.762 --> 19:57.997
has been sniffing
around and running scams

19:58.030 --> 19:59.666
in Mr. Big's neighborhood.

19:59.699 --> 20:02.402
Now, you got three choices.

20:02.635 --> 20:04.671
One, you can stop.

20:04.704 --> 20:07.540
Two, you can carry on
and pay Mr. Big

20:07.574 --> 20:10.477
a ninety-nine percent
convenience fee.

20:10.510 --> 20:13.613
Three, you stop, but this time
you'll have stopped

20:13.646 --> 20:15.815
'cause you ain't
breathing no more.

20:15.848 --> 20:18.885
Now, this ninety-nine percent
convenience fee

20:18.918 --> 20:21.821
can I assume, be negotiated?

20:23.523 --> 20:24.691
Understood.

20:26.058 --> 20:29.896
Hey TC,
do you think they're gone?

20:29.929 --> 20:33.800
Let's wait a little
longer just to make sure.

20:41.308 --> 20:43.042
That was... bracing.

20:43.075 --> 20:45.312
It's nice in here, actually.

20:45.345 --> 20:47.614
It kind of smells like home.

20:47.647 --> 20:48.848
Are you kidding?

20:48.881 --> 20:51.751
I would never
call a trashcan "home".

20:51.784 --> 20:55.522
But who is this
Mr. Big everybody talks about?

20:55.555 --> 20:58.558
He is the most dangerous
gangster in town.

20:58.591 --> 21:00.760
Apparently,
he and his crew pulled off

21:00.793 --> 21:02.762
that diamond heist last week.

21:02.795 --> 21:06.966
Benny my boy, we just got
ourselves a new pet project.

21:07.367 --> 21:09.469
Ma says I can't have any pets

21:09.502 --> 21:11.938
on account
I ain't responsible enough.

21:11.971 --> 21:15.808
I once had a cat for a while
but it turned out it was me.

21:31.591 --> 21:35.061
I knew those mugs would lead us
right to the diamonds.

21:35.094 --> 21:37.063
We're gonna
take them from them,

21:37.096 --> 21:40.467
and it won't be even stealing
'cause they are already stolen.

21:44.971 --> 21:46.906
Benny, have you ever heard

21:46.939 --> 21:50.076
of the eminent
Doctor Sylvester Garfield?

21:50.109 --> 21:52.779
-Nope.
-Neither have they.

21:54.013 --> 21:56.749
I'm taking the diamonds
to the safe house.

21:56.783 --> 21:58.851
You guys rustle up some dinner.

21:58.885 --> 22:02.389
And it better not be
margherita pizza again.

22:02.622 --> 22:04.691
Idiots! You guys are dumb.

22:04.724 --> 22:08.327
Oh, yeah. So much margherita.

22:38.925 --> 22:40.927
What the...?
What are you doing?

22:40.960 --> 22:42.629
Do not touch that cat!

22:42.662 --> 22:45.932
Who are you to tell me what
to do with this filthy fat cat?

22:46.466 --> 22:49.569
I am Doctor Sylvester Garfield,

22:49.602 --> 22:51.070
expert in infectious diseases.

22:51.103 --> 22:53.440
And you are touching a
patient with deadly

22:53.473 --> 22:55.942
"lupubolavia-B" virus.

22:55.975 --> 22:59.979
Better known as
The Undertaker Flu.

23:05.084 --> 23:08.855
Ahh, another
victim of The Undertaker.

23:08.888 --> 23:12.124
He sneezed in my face!
He sneezed right in my face!

23:12.158 --> 23:14.093
Oh, that's really bad
right there,

23:14.126 --> 23:16.529
but it was only minutes ago.

23:16.563 --> 23:18.698
One! No, I'm dying!

23:18.731 --> 23:21.167
One and a half!
I'm gonna die!

23:21.200 --> 23:24.971
There might be a chance for you,
my beefy friend.

23:25.004 --> 23:27.540
Here, hold still as I administer

23:27.574 --> 23:29.876
these life-saving eye drops.

23:29.909 --> 23:31.210
Look up to the sky!

23:31.243 --> 23:33.613
The sky is your only hope.

23:33.646 --> 23:35.448
Do it now or I'll fix you good.

23:36.048 --> 23:37.684
Remember, you asked for it.

23:57.937 --> 24:02.241
This is the most pain I've ever
felt in my entire life!

24:02.274 --> 24:04.677
Does that mean it's working,
Doctor Garfield?

24:04.711 --> 24:07.780
Yah, but you should
drink the rest.

24:07.814 --> 24:09.949
Drink the rest of the eye drops?

24:09.982 --> 24:12.251
It can only help your chances.

24:12.284 --> 24:15.021
And I should very much
like to see what happens.

24:15.054 --> 24:16.222
Give me that!

24:33.172 --> 24:35.174
Congratulations, you are cured.

24:35.207 --> 24:37.810
You saved my life, doc!
What do I owe you?

24:38.044 --> 24:39.712
I'll do anything!

24:39.746 --> 24:42.014
Nothing, the bill
has been paid in full.

24:42.214 --> 24:43.850
Good day to you, sir.

24:46.953 --> 24:48.888
I can't stop looking at them!

24:48.921 --> 24:50.623
I think I'm in love with them.

24:50.823 --> 24:52.759
I can't sleep, I can't eat,

24:52.792 --> 24:56.128
and I think they deserve
better than me!

25:02.802 --> 25:04.804
Hey, who pooped in my bag?

25:04.837 --> 25:07.807
Orange peels? Egg shells?

25:07.840 --> 25:09.508
And a rotten cabbage?

25:11.578 --> 25:14.146
Someone's gonna pay for this!

25:14.581 --> 25:16.749
Oh, I can't wait
for the stores to open.

25:16.783 --> 25:18.117
I want to buy it all!

25:18.150 --> 25:19.986
I'll begin with that lamppost
over there!

25:20.019 --> 25:23.022
Don't you think we should
keep ourselves from spending?

25:23.055 --> 25:26.759
Perhaps open an investment
account, save for retirement?

25:26.793 --> 25:28.928
You're right,
if I hold on to these,

25:28.961 --> 25:31.197
I'm gonna spend it all
in no time.

25:31.230 --> 25:34.300
But who? Who can I trust
to keep these babies safe?

25:34.333 --> 25:36.903
Well, your buddy Benny,
of course!

25:43.876 --> 25:45.978
Ok, I suppose you earned it.

25:46.345 --> 25:49.181
Listen to me, Benny,
this is really important.

25:49.716 --> 25:52.318
Are you sure I can trust you?

25:53.319 --> 25:55.588
I need a verbal yes or no.

25:55.622 --> 25:59.191
Don't worry, TC,
I'm the best at hiding things.

25:59.225 --> 26:01.894
Well, as long as I left you
the easy part,

26:02.128 --> 26:04.631
I'll do the most difficult,
dangerous, important part.

26:04.664 --> 26:06.699
Sure, TC, and what's that?

26:06.933 --> 26:08.334
Reservations!

26:36.162 --> 26:38.665
Oh, what a night!

26:38.698 --> 26:41.333
Although, are you sure
we should be out so soon

26:41.367 --> 26:43.169
after our heist, TC?

26:43.202 --> 26:45.872
It's called hiding
in plain sight.

26:46.105 --> 26:48.107
Another round of "milktinis"!

26:48.140 --> 26:50.076
And get some salmon bits
for yourself.

26:55.181 --> 26:57.650
And back to that hiding issue...

26:57.684 --> 27:00.252
Where did my star hider
hide my little treasure?

27:00.286 --> 27:03.022
Your star hider?
Oh, oh, that's me!

27:03.055 --> 27:07.026
It seems you're one
of our finest clients tonight.

27:07.059 --> 27:09.228
The manager wants to meet you.

27:10.362 --> 27:11.998
I tell you, Benny,

27:12.031 --> 27:14.066
sometimes it seems like
the world

27:14.100 --> 27:16.135
is out to make
everything just perf--

27:25.878 --> 27:30.182
So, you think you can come
into my nightclub

27:30.216 --> 27:34.821
and pay your way
with one of my diamonds?

27:37.924 --> 27:41.460
Benny, did you know that
Mr. Big owns this nightclub?

27:41.493 --> 27:42.829
Yes.

27:42.862 --> 27:45.798
Ah! And why did you not
tell me this?

27:45.832 --> 27:47.366
You didn't ask.

27:47.399 --> 27:51.437
Mr. Big, I can explain!
This was all a misunderstanding!

27:51.871 --> 27:54.073
Like what you see, Cat?

27:54.106 --> 27:55.241
Are you kidding?

27:56.275 --> 27:57.944
All you need is a
plastic surgeon and a toupee

27:57.977 --> 28:00.146
and you could be in the movies!

28:00.179 --> 28:01.714
Horror movies.

28:01.748 --> 28:03.783
Look, you're a businessman.

28:03.816 --> 28:05.718
I'm sure we can work this out.

28:05.752 --> 28:09.355
Of course we can.

28:09.388 --> 28:10.422
Ape!

28:12.124 --> 28:15.061
Ooh! I love water slides!

28:15.294 --> 28:19.966
Now, I could tell you how we're
gonna work this out,

28:19.999 --> 28:22.902
but I'd rather show you.

28:22.935 --> 28:25.171
Yeah, show them boss!

28:25.371 --> 28:28.240
So tell me, Bad Dog,

28:28.274 --> 28:33.145
who lost my diamonds
to these two gentlemen?

28:33.179 --> 28:35.347
Oh, that! Well, sir, I-- I...

28:35.948 --> 28:37.750
want to be straight with you.

28:37.784 --> 28:38.918
It was Ape.

28:44.156 --> 28:45.224
Were you...

28:45.257 --> 28:47.960
paying attention?

28:47.994 --> 28:51.497
I actually had something in
my eye, so I missed most of it.

28:51.530 --> 28:53.299
Could you should us again?

28:53.332 --> 28:56.168
We understand. Shoved into
the bottomless pit... bad.

28:56.202 --> 28:58.437
Mr. Big, very bad.

28:58.470 --> 29:00.973
Well, glad we could
work this out! Thanks, boys!

29:02.875 --> 29:04.811
I'll just make this short.

29:04.844 --> 29:08.147
My gang runs all the crime
in this city.

29:08.180 --> 29:12.118
It's allowed me to collect
treasures from around the world.

29:12.551 --> 29:17.256
But none of them are
as rare or as valuable

29:17.289 --> 29:19.491
as those diamonds.

29:19.525 --> 29:23.830
Each one is worth millions!

29:23.863 --> 29:27.766
So I just need to know
one thing...

29:28.434 --> 29:32.438
Where are the rest
of my diamonds?

29:32.471 --> 29:33.472
Really, I don't know!

29:37.043 --> 29:39.511
Right, the begging
and screaming thing.

29:39.545 --> 29:42.314
Oh, okay,
I'll tell you where they are.

29:42.348 --> 29:45.517
Wrong, you'll take us to them.

29:45.551 --> 29:47.586
Bad Dog will go with you.

29:47.619 --> 29:50.256
That way, if you're lying,

29:50.289 --> 29:52.524
he can beat the truth
out of you.

29:52.558 --> 29:55.862
Oh, please be lying!

29:55.895 --> 30:00.299
Now go get my diamonds!

30:00.867 --> 30:02.068
Gee, Top Cat,

30:02.101 --> 30:06.338
I really wish you had asked me
if Mr. Big owned this club.

30:06.372 --> 30:09.208
Me, too, Benny. Me, too.

30:17.884 --> 30:21.420
Well, don't just stand there,
hand over the diamonds, cats!

30:21.453 --> 30:24.156
Yes, the diamonds.
You're standing on them.

30:24.190 --> 30:26.358
Benny, be a dear and help
the gentleman here

30:26.392 --> 30:28.427
pulling the floor boards
and digging the diamonds out,

30:28.460 --> 30:30.162
while I sit and rest
for a moment.

30:30.529 --> 30:31.597
Digging them out?

30:31.998 --> 30:33.832
Err... not so fast!

30:34.233 --> 30:37.569
I'll be the one doing
all the sitting here

30:37.603 --> 30:41.307
and you dig the stones out,

30:41.340 --> 30:43.342
What? Get me out of here!

30:43.375 --> 30:45.277
Grab the stones and let's scram!

30:45.311 --> 30:47.513
-About that...

30:48.114 --> 30:50.582
All right, you hid them in like
a secret compartment?

30:50.616 --> 30:54.486
Does on the kitchen table
count as a secret compartment?

30:54.921 --> 30:55.988
What?

30:57.924 --> 30:59.291
Well, they don't
seem to be there!

30:59.325 --> 31:02.061
-I know.
-What? They're gone?

31:02.094 --> 31:03.395
Millions of dollars!

31:03.429 --> 31:06.065
Oh, you're so dead!
Pull me out, now!

31:06.098 --> 31:09.668
Excuse us, my associate and I
have to step out for a moment.

31:09.701 --> 31:11.603
Run!

31:13.239 --> 31:15.341
-Okay, cheese it!
-Coming!

31:16.108 --> 31:18.344
What? No!
Come back here, you two!

31:18.377 --> 31:20.546
You no good,
miserable pieces of scum!

31:20.579 --> 31:23.015
I'm gonna make violins
out of your guts.

31:23.049 --> 31:24.550
You're only making it harder
on yourselves,

31:24.583 --> 31:26.385
you pathetic furballs.

31:26.418 --> 31:29.121
Come back! They're getting away!

31:30.056 --> 31:32.258
Gone, they're gone!

31:32.291 --> 31:35.494
How could I have trusted you

31:35.527 --> 31:38.397
with something so important?

31:38.430 --> 31:41.400
All my dreams vanished.
I was so close!

31:42.001 --> 31:44.270
- What happened, boss?
-Took you long enough!

31:44.303 --> 31:45.437
Get me out of here!

31:45.471 --> 31:48.975
No, wait! Get those cats!
No, search for the diamonds!

31:49.008 --> 31:50.509
Oh, do something!

31:57.683 --> 32:00.286
Not only am I gonna get killed,

32:00.486 --> 32:03.122
but I'm gonna be a poor corpse!

32:03.155 --> 32:05.524
I'm gonna be so...!

32:05.557 --> 32:07.659
Oh, hello, Mrs. B.

32:08.060 --> 32:11.197
Oh dear, why is our furniture
running away?

32:11.230 --> 32:12.331
-No, Ma,

32:12.364 --> 32:13.532
they're looking for the--

32:13.565 --> 32:15.567
Spanish doubloons!
They're pirates!

32:15.601 --> 32:17.169
You know how it is with them,

32:17.203 --> 32:19.405
always the
looting and plundering!

32:19.438 --> 32:20.306
Oh goodie!

32:21.507 --> 32:23.542
I hope they finally take away
that blasted sofa of ours.

32:23.575 --> 32:25.644
Yes, seems
that would take a while.

32:25.677 --> 32:27.379
Maybe we should let them
do their job.

32:27.413 --> 32:28.614
Oh that's fine.

32:28.647 --> 32:30.049
Tonight is bingo night

32:30.082 --> 32:31.183
and I've made some extra dough

32:31.217 --> 32:32.484
and I wouldn't mind
doubling tonight.

32:32.518 --> 32:33.352
Wanna come?

32:34.286 --> 32:36.422
Oh, no thanks,
you go and have some fun.

32:36.788 --> 32:39.391
Not you. You're coming with me!

32:40.259 --> 32:43.762
Do-do, be doop do, parara-ching!

32:43.795 --> 32:49.368
Tat-tat, tarira, rat-tat-tat...

32:58.544 --> 32:59.545
Oh!

32:59.745 --> 33:01.280
Hi, Officer!

33:01.480 --> 33:03.449
The door was unlocked
so we let ourselves in.

33:03.482 --> 33:05.351
The door wasn't unlocked!

33:05.384 --> 33:07.653
It was after we hit it
a few times with a shovel.

33:07.686 --> 33:10.256
But enough witty banter.
You've got to protect us!

33:10.289 --> 33:13.659
We had a little...
misunderstanding with Mr. Big.

33:13.692 --> 33:17.596
Yes, he kind of thought
we had taken his diamonds.

33:17.629 --> 33:19.531
And he turned out to be right!

33:19.565 --> 33:21.700
Well, okay, he understood
quite well actually.

33:21.733 --> 33:22.801
You?

33:22.834 --> 33:27.106
You're the ones who stole from
Mr. Big?

33:27.139 --> 33:29.075
From my point of view,
it doesn't count as stealing

33:29.108 --> 33:30.742
when the stuff
is already stolen.

33:30.776 --> 33:32.578
That's recycling.

33:32.611 --> 33:34.213
This is huge, huge!

33:34.246 --> 33:37.283
You guys are gonna help me
catch Mr. Big! I mean--

33:37.316 --> 33:38.650
Mr. Big.

33:51.663 --> 33:53.065
Look, it's us!

33:53.099 --> 33:54.633
Reward? These guys!

33:54.666 --> 33:57.603
Fifty thousand dollars
and ninety five cents?

33:57.636 --> 33:59.438
Don't worry!

33:59.471 --> 34:01.773
Officer Dibble
here will protect you.

34:01.807 --> 34:04.476
If anything happens to you,
he'll be fired.

34:04.510 --> 34:05.644
Huh?

34:05.677 --> 34:06.812
So don't be afraid.

34:06.845 --> 34:09.748
I'm sure you won't
have any problem.

34:54.826 --> 34:57.263
Alright,
good morning, everybody!

34:58.597 --> 35:00.766
-Get them!
- Yeah!

35:15.281 --> 35:16.382
Oh!

35:24.690 --> 35:27.259
-Ah!
-Ooh, ha, ahh!

35:57.323 --> 35:59.325
I'm an experienced officer.

35:59.591 --> 36:01.260
This is humiliating.

36:01.293 --> 36:04.763
Benny, did you...?
Did you use that diaper?

36:04.796 --> 36:06.698
I'm just trying to be authentic.

36:06.932 --> 36:08.800
All passengers to Boonsville,

36:08.834 --> 36:10.302
this is the last call.

36:28.487 --> 36:30.722
We just got to get you
past those guys.

36:30.756 --> 36:32.391
Once you're in the suburbs,

36:32.424 --> 36:34.460
Granny Dibble
will take care of you.

36:34.493 --> 36:35.661
-Wonderful, I love

36:35.694 --> 36:37.396
being taken care of!

36:38.497 --> 36:40.999
Aw, isn't that nice?

36:41.032 --> 36:42.701
-What do we have here?
-Huh?

36:42.734 --> 36:43.935
What cute little...

36:43.969 --> 36:45.404
-Duuhhh...

36:45.437 --> 36:47.639
-...babies, I'm guessing?

36:47.673 --> 36:50.376
Because the thing
they have around there.

36:53.379 --> 36:55.547
Ouch! Hey! Why, you little...!

36:55.581 --> 36:57.383
-Look what you did!

36:57.416 --> 36:58.950
You scared him!

37:04.390 --> 37:05.291
Heh-heh.

37:05.324 --> 37:08.026
I may have overfed him a bit.

37:09.428 --> 37:10.729
The little imp!

37:10.962 --> 37:13.665
But I must get
my little cherubs on that train.

37:15.334 --> 37:17.002
Here, lady, let us help you.

37:17.035 --> 37:19.271
Thank you. What nice young men.

37:19.305 --> 37:22.941
Well I'll be off.
Have a wonderful time, sweeties!

37:22.974 --> 37:24.109
-Wait.

37:24.142 --> 37:26.978
You're gonna let your kids
go on a train by themselves?

37:27.012 --> 37:29.981
Oh, they're very mature
for their age.

37:30.015 --> 37:33.619
So I'm sending them
to college earlier. Ta-ta!

37:35.020 --> 37:38.857
I know if I had a mom
that cared that much about me,

37:38.890 --> 37:41.393
I think I could
have been President.

37:41.927 --> 37:43.261
Oh...

37:56.107 --> 37:57.443
Not now, Benny.

37:59.845 --> 38:01.947
I was so close.

38:31.543 --> 38:32.678
Ahhh...

38:34.813 --> 38:37.583
Are you
Officer Dibble's grandmother?

38:37.616 --> 38:41.453
No, you're much too young.
Surely you must be his sister!

38:41.487 --> 38:43.321
Don't you sweet talk to me.

38:45.924 --> 38:47.393
Oh! Ahhh.

38:47.959 --> 38:51.397
Shh, over here.
Call me Granny.

38:52.964 --> 38:57.403
Now how about we get you fellas
to your new home?

38:57.436 --> 38:58.770
We have to get going!

38:58.970 --> 39:02.374
This whole place is full
of southern Confederate goons!

39:02.408 --> 39:03.208
What?

39:03.709 --> 39:06.378
I imagine
you'll be wanting to eat!

39:13.051 --> 39:15.721
And lobster ravioli
with saffron cream sauce,

39:15.754 --> 39:17.723
with pear and prosciutto salad
on the side.

39:17.756 --> 39:19.758
And eh, island duck meatballs

39:19.791 --> 39:21.693
with green mustard and
pistachios...

39:21.727 --> 39:24.463
-I like cabbage!
-No cabbage!

39:25.464 --> 39:29.067
And coquilles St-Jacques
Ã  la Parisienne, and...

39:30.902 --> 39:32.103
A cracker?

39:32.137 --> 39:34.706
No, half a cracker.

39:34.740 --> 39:36.508
-There's two of you.
-But...

39:36.542 --> 39:38.644
Are you arguing with me, maggot?

39:38.677 --> 39:39.478
Maggot?

39:40.746 --> 39:43.949
Yes, maggot, you'll get a meal
when you have done your chores.

39:43.982 --> 39:45.817
And not one second before!

39:45.851 --> 39:48.119
Do you understand, maggot?

39:49.054 --> 39:52.090
Now, share that cracker!

39:58.897 --> 40:02.133
Now, you're going to do
some chores.

40:02.167 --> 40:04.035
Do you hear me, maggots?

40:04.069 --> 40:06.204
-They hear you in Germany.
-Good!

40:06.237 --> 40:09.808
We must remain
eternally prepared.

40:09.841 --> 40:11.610
And how do we do that?

40:11.810 --> 40:14.045
Plenty of rest and rich food?

40:14.079 --> 40:16.882
No! We do it with chores!

40:17.148 --> 40:21.720
Here is the list of chores
you will do every day.

40:21.753 --> 40:23.555
Well, that's not so...

40:23.755 --> 40:25.156
-Ah!
-Oh!

40:25.190 --> 40:27.158
Now get cracking, maggots!

40:56.655 --> 40:58.790
This isn't a chore exactly.

40:58.824 --> 41:01.192
-Move it, move it, move it!

41:12.938 --> 41:14.005
Oh.

41:20.011 --> 41:21.947
Yeah! Huh?

41:24.115 --> 41:26.852
I've devoted my life
to avoiding work,

41:27.252 --> 41:31.022
because I always pictured it
being exactly like this.

41:31.056 --> 41:32.758
But look at the garden.

41:32.958 --> 41:34.225
It looks beautiful now!

41:34.259 --> 41:36.928
It shines like a diamond...
Ooops!

41:40.098 --> 41:42.500
Let's stay away
from the diamond subject.

41:42.701 --> 41:43.769
It's painful.

41:45.837 --> 41:48.273
I trapped him!
We've got the lion!

41:48.306 --> 41:49.741
Brain, this is a cat.

41:49.775 --> 41:51.309
We've talked about
the differences between

41:51.342 --> 41:52.811
one and the other before.

41:52.844 --> 41:54.980
I even showed you pictures,
remember?

41:55.013 --> 41:57.616
Ahhh... Of course I'm a cat!

41:57.649 --> 41:59.651
What are you six looking at?

41:59.918 --> 42:03.088
Be careful,
this lion is really angry!

42:03.121 --> 42:04.656
Stop, lion, stop!

42:04.690 --> 42:05.991
But he is a cat.

42:06.024 --> 42:08.627
Indeed!
Now, what's all the fuss about?

42:08.660 --> 42:10.228
And where did
the other three go?

42:10.261 --> 42:12.731
We're really sorry.
I'm Choo Choo.

42:12.764 --> 42:15.767
And my friends here
are Fancy Fancy and Brain.

42:15.801 --> 42:16.968
And I'm Brain!

42:17.002 --> 42:19.971
We're clowns at the local
circus. Well, I guess we were.

42:20.005 --> 42:21.039
Yes.

42:21.072 --> 42:23.675
It seems one of us thought
he could ask the lion

42:23.709 --> 42:26.177
to wait out of this cage
for a little moment

42:26.211 --> 42:27.345
while he was cleaning it.

42:27.378 --> 42:30.816
Really? Who?
Oh, you mean me!

42:30.849 --> 42:33.284
Yes, I did. Brain, by the way.

42:33.318 --> 42:35.821
Yes, as in Brainless.
And who are you two?

42:35.854 --> 42:38.156
For your information,
I'm a protected witness.

42:38.189 --> 42:39.891
A very important one.

42:39.925 --> 42:41.559
You can call me Top Cat.

42:43.829 --> 42:46.297
-Huh, still no trumpets.
-Hey, hello!

42:46.331 --> 42:48.299
Yeah, and he is Benny.

42:48.333 --> 42:49.635
The Ball.

42:49.668 --> 42:50.669
Whatever.

42:50.869 --> 42:52.370
What are we gonna do now?

42:52.403 --> 42:55.641
Being clowns
was the only job we could get!

43:03.214 --> 43:06.284
So you are looking at a
career opportunity, I assume?

43:06.317 --> 43:09.087
It so happens I have
a once-in-a-lifetime

43:09.120 --> 43:11.289
opening in my
business corporation.

43:11.322 --> 43:14.025
Money, girls, cars,
anything you might want.

43:14.059 --> 43:15.961
Must say it's not for everyone,

43:15.994 --> 43:17.696
but if it's something that fits
your needs,

43:17.729 --> 43:18.664
I might consider you.

43:18.697 --> 43:21.232
-No, we want lions.
-Don't mind him, go on.

43:21.432 --> 43:24.670
Well, it's a very tough
and discerning process.

43:24.703 --> 43:28.139
You will be tested and taught
in the ways of a luxurious life.

43:28.339 --> 43:31.977
-What do we have to do to join?
-Follow me, let's get started.

43:32.010 --> 43:33.344
-Yey!
-Yeeeeeey!

43:33.378 --> 43:35.113
Why don't you just

43:35.146 --> 43:37.115
stay here and finish that fence?

43:46.758 --> 43:49.928
Alright, let's see what issues
we need to focus on.

43:49.961 --> 43:52.698
Well, I get pushed around a lot.

43:52.731 --> 43:55.000
Roughed up, pummeled,
savagely beaten.

43:55.200 --> 43:57.703
-So you want to toughen up?
-Yeah!

43:57.736 --> 43:59.404
Then you need...

44:00.739 --> 44:02.974
-Mop Fu!
-Mop Fu?

44:03.174 --> 44:06.678
The Way of the Mop,
highly advanced martial arts.

44:06.712 --> 44:09.247
Even ninjas are afraid
of Mop Fu experts.

44:09.480 --> 44:11.750
Even ninjas? Wow!

44:26.164 --> 44:28.066
And you, Brain?

44:28.099 --> 44:29.400
What's your problem?

44:29.434 --> 44:31.069
People think I'm dumb.

44:31.269 --> 44:32.838
I'd like to be smarter.

44:32.871 --> 44:33.939
Aha, I see.

44:34.139 --> 44:36.307
-Because people think I'm dumb.
-Right.

44:36.341 --> 44:39.745
-So I'd like to be...
-Smarter! Got it, let's see.

44:39.978 --> 44:41.346
Ah, here we go!

44:42.247 --> 44:43.949
Read this

44:43.982 --> 44:46.417
and you'll know how to repair
a complex piece of machinery!

44:46.451 --> 44:48.954
You'll be a rocket scientist
in no time!

44:48.987 --> 44:50.956
"With the sparking
plug inverted,

44:50.989 --> 44:54.159
unbolt the brindle clamp from
the transverse torque coupler."

44:54.192 --> 44:57.095
Wow, I feel smarter already!

44:57.428 --> 45:00.231
And what's your damage?

45:00.265 --> 45:02.433
I'm a romantic cat,
my problem lies within.

45:02.467 --> 45:05.871
I yearn for a soul mate, but
whenever I speak to the ladies

45:05.904 --> 45:08.940
mine tongue becomes tangled
and unwieldy.

45:09.240 --> 45:11.176
I can't even meow properly.

45:12.811 --> 45:15.981
Well, no problem
my amorous friend.

45:16.014 --> 45:17.148
Here you go!

45:17.182 --> 45:20.418
Ladies can't resist French,
it's the language of love!

45:20.819 --> 45:23.421
This is gonna make you
a regular "Cats-anova."

45:31.562 --> 45:34.800
Ooo-la-la, I'm swooning here!

45:34.833 --> 45:36.968
And while you're doing that,
wash the windows.

45:37.002 --> 45:38.904
But what does that have to do
with learning French?

45:38.937 --> 45:40.939
Are you questioning me, maggot?

45:40.972 --> 45:42.507
Sir, no sir!

45:47.078 --> 45:50.048
Ki-ya! Ki-Ya!

45:50.515 --> 45:52.117
Ki-ya!

45:52.951 --> 45:56.187
Ki-ya! Ki-ya!

45:56.487 --> 45:58.156
Ki-ya!

46:19.878 --> 46:21.346
Pie Inspector, ma'am.

46:21.379 --> 46:23.314
We're gonna have
to inspect your pies.

46:23.348 --> 46:25.216
Cherry, apple, that
lemon merengue number there,

46:25.250 --> 46:25.917
and...

46:26.617 --> 46:27.718
Was that badge made of cheese?

46:27.752 --> 46:30.922
Ma'am, the penalty for hindering
a federal pie inspection

46:30.956 --> 46:34.525
is quite severe!
Please, let us do our work.

46:34.559 --> 46:37.095
Oh, oh! Okay, thank you.

46:37.128 --> 46:38.329
Here they are.

46:40.198 --> 46:41.833
Huh? Huh?

46:49.340 --> 46:51.476
Yeah, it's me,
put me through with...

46:51.509 --> 46:53.211
Mr. Big.

46:58.516 --> 47:00.351
I see.

47:05.323 --> 47:09.294
Hey Top Cat, tell us
about your life in the big city.

47:09.327 --> 47:12.898
The thing is, sure, there
are some bad kitties out there.

47:13.431 --> 47:16.034
But I can always outthink them.

47:16.267 --> 47:17.869
And when you
add that I happen...

47:17.903 --> 47:19.104
-...to be the toughest

47:19.137 --> 47:20.271
cat there is,

47:20.671 --> 47:22.573
you have
an unbeatable combination.

47:22.607 --> 47:25.543
Thine appearance is not one
of brutish force, though.

47:25.944 --> 47:27.913
Yeah, no muscles.

47:27.946 --> 47:30.048
I use the most important one

47:30.081 --> 47:31.282
my brain!

47:31.316 --> 47:33.651
I want to be the nice cat,
the reasonable feline.

47:33.684 --> 47:35.320
But if there's ever a time

47:35.353 --> 47:38.389
I have to become
Mister Sabre Tooth Tough cat,

47:38.423 --> 47:40.091
I can!

47:40.125 --> 47:42.393
And that's why they call me...

47:42.427 --> 47:43.561
Top Cat!

47:50.969 --> 47:53.538
So you see,
there's no one,

47:53.571 --> 47:57.542
no one who tells me what to do,
and I'm not afraid of anyone!

48:05.183 --> 48:06.451
Hey, hi Rat!

48:07.485 --> 48:08.553
It's Rat!

48:15.026 --> 48:17.963
You know what?
You guys keep working.

48:17.996 --> 48:19.564
We're going to, uh...

48:19.597 --> 48:22.367
run out
and get you some ice cream!

48:22.400 --> 48:24.402
Hello, cats.

48:25.203 --> 48:27.973
You shouldn't have
crossed Mister Big, cat.

48:28.006 --> 48:30.008
Oh, of course!

48:30.041 --> 48:33.611
You must be Mister Big's
stupid goons.

48:33.644 --> 48:37.282
Top Cat's always talking about
how incredibly dumb you are!

48:37.315 --> 48:40.018
Don't listen to them,
I never said such a thing.

48:40.251 --> 48:43.021
Yeah, he told us
how dumb you are.

48:43.054 --> 48:44.589
You should meet Mister Big's

48:44.622 --> 48:46.424
stupid goons.

48:46.457 --> 48:49.127
They are undoubtedly
the dumbest thugs in town!

48:49.160 --> 48:50.295
See?

48:50.495 --> 48:53.198
This little sniveling,
lying feline

48:53.398 --> 48:56.667
has been feeding you
a bag of bull. He ain't tough.

48:56.701 --> 48:59.404
He's the cowardliest,
snivelingest,

48:59.437 --> 49:04.209
grovelingiest con cat anyone has
ever had the misfortune to know!

49:12.217 --> 49:13.684
Okay, where were we?

49:20.191 --> 49:23.528
Get your stinking paws
off my cat!

49:36.741 --> 49:38.743
-Huh?

49:39.144 --> 49:41.146
Ya! Take this!

49:44.515 --> 49:47.652
Oh, isn't that adorable?

49:56.694 --> 50:00.698
Get out of here!
Run and keep running!

50:00.731 --> 50:02.200
I'll be all right.

50:02.600 --> 50:05.002
-You heard the lady!

50:06.737 --> 50:07.738
Bah!

50:15.513 --> 50:16.547
- Huh?

50:33.231 --> 50:34.232
Uh-oh.

50:37.802 --> 50:41.072
- Yeee-haw!

50:50.815 --> 50:54.652
Well, I've enjoyed meeting you
but I have to move on. Bye!

50:54.685 --> 50:57.555
This is it? Are you going away,
just like that?

50:57.588 --> 50:59.257
Don't leave, we need you.

50:59.290 --> 51:01.259
When we met you we were just
simple buffoons,

51:01.292 --> 51:02.593
and look at us now.

51:02.627 --> 51:05.330
Chased by the city's
most dangerous monsters!

51:05.363 --> 51:08.566
Who are out to kill us!
How could we ever thank you?

51:08.599 --> 51:10.401
Hey, it's not all bad news.

51:10.601 --> 51:12.503
You've all passed my training!

51:12.537 --> 51:13.704
-Can you repeat?
-What?

51:14.139 --> 51:16.274
Of course you have.

51:16.307 --> 51:18.809
You are now
honorable members of my gang.

51:18.843 --> 51:20.478
Yeeeeeyyy!

51:20.511 --> 51:23.514
And as honorable members
of my gang,

51:23.548 --> 51:26.184
you must pay your
membership fee!

51:26.217 --> 51:27.785
-Yaayyy!
-What?

51:28.186 --> 51:30.255
That'll be
five hundred dollars each.

51:30.288 --> 51:31.589
We've got a buck, forty.

51:32.690 --> 51:34.392
And a dead grasshopper.

51:34.425 --> 51:36.627
-Deal! You can keep the bug.
-Yay!

51:36.827 --> 51:40.265
Only a chosen few
have this badge.

51:40.298 --> 51:42.633
You must honor it,
live up to it.

51:42.667 --> 51:45.770
And most importantly,
pay me each month

51:45.803 --> 51:48.173
for a yearly maintenance fee.

51:48.206 --> 51:51.242
-Understood?
-No badge for me?

51:52.743 --> 51:56.281
Ah, you don't need it, you're
coming with me, Benny the Ball.

51:56.314 --> 51:58.149
-Give me your hand.
-What?

52:14.199 --> 52:17.168
Okay now, first of all
we got to call for help.

52:17.202 --> 52:19.604
All I need is a payphone.

52:19.637 --> 52:20.805
Great!

52:20.838 --> 52:23.241
Benny boy,
hand over the dollar, forty

52:23.274 --> 52:25.776
our former associates
gave us, please.

52:31.282 --> 52:32.717
What?

52:36.521 --> 52:39.624
Alright then,

52:39.657 --> 52:42.793
I guess we'll have to walk to
my old friend, Officer Dibble.

52:42.827 --> 52:44.429
He'll know what to do.

52:44.462 --> 52:47.498
What?
Officer Dibble is your friend?

52:47.532 --> 52:48.966
But he's a cop!

52:48.999 --> 52:50.535
Why is he and I'm not?

52:50.568 --> 52:53.238
Because a friend
would never lose something

52:53.271 --> 52:55.240
his friend asked him
to take care of.

52:57.942 --> 53:00.711
I'm sorry, let's go, okay?

53:00.745 --> 53:02.747
Anyway, as I told you before.

53:02.780 --> 53:04.582
I work better solo.

53:05.550 --> 53:07.184
Okay, TC.

53:07.518 --> 53:10.421
Guess I'm...
gonna check on my mom.

53:21.532 --> 53:24.735
s Mom] I've had about
enough from you, Mrs. Handy!

53:24.769 --> 53:26.604
I've got a half a mind to...

53:26.637 --> 53:29.374
What, hit me?
You don't have the guts!

53:29.407 --> 53:30.441
Ma!

53:30.475 --> 53:31.976
Benny boy!

53:32.377 --> 53:36.314
Oh, my boy,
my precious baby boy!

53:36.347 --> 53:38.816
I've been so worried about you!

53:38.849 --> 53:41.452
It's true,
she won't shut up about it.

53:41.486 --> 53:42.820
I'm okay, ma.

53:42.853 --> 53:44.922
I'm sorry
I couldn't tell you where I was.

53:45.456 --> 53:48.426
After those hooligans
tore the place apart,

53:48.459 --> 53:51.028
well, I was just beside myself.

53:51.061 --> 53:54.031
I would never have had
the money to fix the place up,

53:54.064 --> 53:56.701
if I hadn't used
those sparkly beads you left

53:56.734 --> 53:58.569
to make a fancy cat collar.

53:58.603 --> 54:01.606
Oh, I'm sorry, Ma, I...

54:01.639 --> 54:03.341
Sparkly beads?

54:03.374 --> 54:06.344
Yes, the ones you left
in the leather bag.

54:06.377 --> 54:09.314
You made a cat collar
out of them? For who?

54:09.347 --> 54:11.982
That singer lady,
the one at the nightclub?

54:12.016 --> 54:14.819
She's very glamorous! Ooo-la-la!

54:14.852 --> 54:17.755
Furletta DuChat!
At the Starlight Club?

54:17.788 --> 54:19.857
Oh my gosh!
Oh my gosh! Oh my gosh!

54:19.890 --> 54:22.693
Top Cat won't be mad
at me anymore!

54:22.727 --> 54:24.629
Thanks, Ma!

54:41.512 --> 54:44.549
Tam-taramtam, tam, tam, tam...

54:46.384 --> 54:48.919
Hmmm. Hmm-hmm!

54:50.355 --> 54:52.523
You take a lot of showers,
Officer.

54:54.392 --> 54:56.060
You should try
licking your body up.

54:56.093 --> 54:57.562
It's healthier for your skin.

54:57.595 --> 54:59.630
Oh, is that so?

54:59.664 --> 55:01.031
You should be at Granny's!

55:01.432 --> 55:02.733
The goons showed up.

55:02.767 --> 55:05.436
What? Is she okay?

55:05.936 --> 55:08.038
Of course she is.

55:08.072 --> 55:09.640
Those poor goons.

55:09.674 --> 55:11.942
But where's Benny?

55:11.976 --> 55:14.011
-He went to check on his mom.
-What?!

55:14.044 --> 55:17.848
No! Mister Big has his goons
watching that place!

55:17.882 --> 55:20.618
I need you both to bust Mr. Big!

55:20.651 --> 55:24.054
Oh gosh, if this gets to
Chief Thumbton, I'll be fired!

55:24.088 --> 55:25.423
Let's go!

55:30.761 --> 55:33.330
-Pants first!
-A wise choice.

55:38.436 --> 55:39.804
-Pst!

55:40.638 --> 55:43.073
Why, if it isn't Top Cat!

55:43.474 --> 55:45.710
Shh! Benny here?

55:46.677 --> 55:48.813
I think he went
to the Starlight Club.

55:48.846 --> 55:50.615
Would you like a rotten cabbage?

55:51.516 --> 55:54.552
Hehe, no thanks,
I'm watching my figure.

56:20.911 --> 56:21.979
Huh?

56:43.868 --> 56:47.071
Oh, silly-silly me!
I forgot my catnip!

56:59.149 --> 57:01.519
Miss DuChat!
Oh god, this is a hit!

57:01.552 --> 57:03.621
-Miss DuChat, please, come.

57:03.654 --> 57:05.990
Miss DuChat!
they're demanding an encore!

57:06.023 --> 57:08.025
-You've got to get out here!
-What's the problem?

57:08.058 --> 57:09.293
Miss DuChat.

57:09.326 --> 57:11.161
We need her to come out right
away out but she doesn't answer.

57:11.195 --> 57:12.196
Don't worry, sir.

57:12.229 --> 57:14.131
I'll take care of this.

57:14.164 --> 57:17.134
Miss DuChat, step aside!

57:17.735 --> 57:20.004
I will burst the door open

57:20.037 --> 57:21.672
-... in a dramatic fashion

57:21.706 --> 57:23.040
on three.

57:23.674 --> 57:24.942
One. Ahhh?

57:24.975 --> 57:26.777
-But, but, I...
- What's next?

57:26.811 --> 57:28.846
Oh yeah... Two!

57:48.633 --> 57:50.868
We must find Benny, remember?

57:56.206 --> 57:58.809
We already have, I guess.

58:04.114 --> 58:05.650
Oh, Benny boy!

58:22.833 --> 58:24.802
I love you, you are magnificent!

58:27.838 --> 58:29.039
Oh!

58:29.574 --> 58:33.944
-Oh my gosh!
-Oh! Furletta DuChat is bald?

58:33.978 --> 58:37.582
No! She stole from
Mr. Big!

58:37.615 --> 58:40.284
Oh, whatever, just go, get him!

58:44.154 --> 58:46.290
-Come back here you!

58:48.593 --> 58:49.960
I'm back!

58:51.028 --> 58:53.530
Oh, oh, oh.

59:00.270 --> 59:01.672
I found them!

59:02.907 --> 59:04.875
-I found them!
-What?

59:06.143 --> 59:07.311
I said I found them!

59:08.846 --> 59:10.848
Huh?

59:14.051 --> 59:15.052
Uh-ohh!

59:18.055 --> 59:20.157
Oh, Get up!
They're getting away.

59:22.392 --> 59:26.063
Hey, that's the cat Mr. Big
is offering a reward for!

59:29.834 --> 59:31.702
Those men took Benny
through that door.

59:36.941 --> 59:38.743
Lovely evening, gentlemen.

59:43.180 --> 59:45.650
Okay, you asked for it!

59:46.684 --> 59:48.318
Wait, we need to rescue Benny.

59:48.352 --> 59:49.720
Taxi!

59:50.788 --> 59:52.322
You've got to hide
until things cool down a bit.

59:52.356 --> 59:54.959
Here is some money,
go to Florida. To the airport!

59:55.760 --> 59:57.895
I promise I'll rescue Benny.

01:00:06.737 --> 01:00:09.774
Sir? Sir! Sir?

01:00:09.807 --> 01:00:13.043
I said coach,
business or first class?

01:00:13.911 --> 01:00:17.682
Eh... First-- first class,
I guess.

01:00:17.982 --> 01:00:21.385
No, wait! Do you have anything
more expensive than first class?

01:00:21.786 --> 01:00:23.287
Well, there's Platinum Class.

01:00:23.320 --> 01:00:24.488
It's just like first class,

01:00:24.521 --> 01:00:27.391
but you get to rest your feet
on a tourist class person.

01:00:27.424 --> 01:00:28.726
I'll take it!

01:00:28.759 --> 01:00:30.394
And forget about Florida.

01:00:30.427 --> 01:00:32.096
Make it Saint-Tropez!

01:00:32.129 --> 01:00:33.363
Yes, sir.

01:00:34.131 --> 01:00:36.801
Ohh, platinum class!

01:00:36.834 --> 01:00:39.870
Can you put that up, sir?
We're about to take off.

01:00:39.904 --> 01:00:41.238
Of course.

01:00:48.779 --> 01:00:51.415
You're a true friend.

01:00:52.282 --> 01:00:55.052
Take it, it's yours now.

01:01:02.993 --> 01:01:04.762
Your attention, please.

01:01:04.795 --> 01:01:06.897
There will be
no more departures today.

01:01:08.065 --> 01:01:09.366
Thank you.

01:01:21.979 --> 01:01:24.448
Do-do, be doop-doop do...

01:01:24.481 --> 01:01:25.850
Doot-doot--

01:01:26.250 --> 01:01:28.753
Would you stop doing that?

01:01:28.786 --> 01:01:30.287
Oh, just get used to it!

01:01:30.320 --> 01:01:32.189
Dibble, we're gonna
rescue Benny.

01:01:32.222 --> 01:01:35.760
-What? We?
-Yes, but we can't do it alone.

01:01:35.793 --> 01:01:38.195
-You won't have to.

01:01:38.228 --> 01:01:40.965
What's this now,
Grand Central Terminal?

01:01:41.165 --> 01:01:43.067
Hey, what are you guys
doing here?

01:01:43.300 --> 01:01:45.870
Well, TC,
with those goons after you,

01:01:45.903 --> 01:01:48.105
we thought
you might need our help.

01:01:48.138 --> 01:01:50.941
Granny Dibble told us you might
be here and gave us a spare key.

01:01:50.975 --> 01:01:53.310
And I wanted to show you
this ice cube I found

01:01:53.343 --> 01:01:55.179
that's shaped like a cow!

01:01:55.212 --> 01:01:59.183
Oh no,
someone stole my ice cube!

01:01:59.549 --> 01:02:01.418
And my pocket's wet!

01:02:03.988 --> 01:02:05.756
So what do you say,

01:02:06.223 --> 01:02:08.058
are we a gang again?

01:02:08.292 --> 01:02:11.728
Yes, yes we are!

01:02:13.230 --> 01:02:14.932
My liege, are you-?

01:02:14.965 --> 01:02:17.234
Of course not!
My eyes are just sweating!

01:02:17.267 --> 01:02:18.535
Yeah yeah, very moving.

01:02:18.568 --> 01:02:20.437
But how are we gonna
rescue Benny?

01:02:20.470 --> 01:02:22.239
Elementary, my dear Dibble!

01:02:22.439 --> 01:02:24.341
Do you have any cheese?

01:02:24.374 --> 01:02:27.077
-I need to carve a badge.
- No!

01:02:27.111 --> 01:02:28.846
No cheese! Never!

01:02:28.879 --> 01:02:30.514
We're gonna talk to
Chief Thumbton!

01:02:31.015 --> 01:02:32.116
I told you, Dibble,

01:02:32.149 --> 01:02:34.318
what would happen to you
if anything happened to them!

01:02:34.351 --> 01:02:36.320
You're discharged
from Mr. Big's case!

01:02:36.353 --> 01:02:38.388
Get out of my sight!
Go wash my car!

01:02:38.422 --> 01:02:39.189
B-- b-- but...

01:02:39.223 --> 01:02:41.158
Not another word
out of that mouth!

01:02:41.191 --> 01:02:44.161
Leave my car alone!
You're fired!

01:02:45.963 --> 01:02:47.932
Does Chipotle Cheddar
work for you?

01:02:50.567 --> 01:02:53.971
So, like I said
before this long flashback,

01:02:54.004 --> 01:02:56.006
why should I stick
my neck out for you?

01:02:56.040 --> 01:02:59.844
Listen bro, how about you take
our tailed buts us out of here

01:02:59.877 --> 01:03:01.946
and bring us to Mr. Big?

01:03:01.979 --> 01:03:05.482
You get the reward
and then we escape. A win-win!

01:03:18.628 --> 01:03:20.865
Meows.

01:03:35.412 --> 01:03:38.182
Wait! How come you know
about this secret door?

01:03:38.215 --> 01:03:40.317
I used to work for Mr. Big.

01:03:40.350 --> 01:03:43.153
But now I'm--
I'm just his slave!

01:03:43.187 --> 01:03:44.922
His pizza slave!

01:03:44.955 --> 01:03:45.990
Pizza.

01:03:46.023 --> 01:03:49.459
That big fat gangster
took my baby away from me.

01:03:51.161 --> 01:03:55.132
I loved Eleanore so much!

01:04:18.022 --> 01:04:21.658
Ain't this just the best thing
in the world?

01:04:21.691 --> 01:04:24.929
Apart from all the threatening
and the killing,

01:04:24.962 --> 01:04:30.000
a really burning-hot
Margarita pizza!

01:04:31.401 --> 01:04:32.970
It's cold!

01:04:33.203 --> 01:04:35.605
You have insulted me.

01:04:35.639 --> 01:04:40.144
Now you'll have to
deliver me hot pizza every day,

01:04:40.177 --> 01:04:42.179
without Eleanore!

01:04:42.212 --> 01:04:47.952
Because she is going
to be as cold as my Margarita!

01:04:47.985 --> 01:04:53.423
-No!

01:04:56.360 --> 01:04:57.461
Eleanore was your bike?

01:04:57.494 --> 01:04:59.363
A hell of a hell cat, you're.

01:04:59.396 --> 01:05:02.099
Yes. And I owe her.

01:05:02.132 --> 01:05:05.569
I want Mr. Big to feel the loss
of something he really loves.

01:05:05.602 --> 01:05:07.637
Cats, I have a plan.

01:05:08.238 --> 01:05:09.706
Yes, again.

01:05:09.739 --> 01:05:11.675
We'll use the diamonds
to rescue Benny

01:05:11.708 --> 01:05:14.544
and free you from Mr. Big!

01:05:14.578 --> 01:05:15.980
Are you in?

01:05:16.013 --> 01:05:17.214
I'm in!

01:05:18.482 --> 01:05:20.050
I've been following you around
so we could join forces, man.

01:05:20.084 --> 01:05:22.252
My enemy's enemy is my friend.

01:05:22.286 --> 01:05:25.322
My name is Spook,
Hell Cat Spook.

01:05:25.355 --> 01:05:27.124
Deal, Hell Cat, Spook!

01:05:27.157 --> 01:05:30.627
Now, I know how
to take down Mr. Big for good!

01:05:30.660 --> 01:05:34.131
I don't know, pulling a con
on Mr. Big will be tough.

01:05:34.164 --> 01:05:37.934
And who said anything
about fooling Mr. Big?

01:05:38.635 --> 01:05:39.970
Say, boss.

01:05:40.170 --> 01:05:41.938
The pizza guy is here!

01:05:48.112 --> 01:05:49.946
We didn't order that much food.

01:05:50.180 --> 01:05:52.216
If you expect me to pay
for all that--

01:05:52.249 --> 01:05:53.417
Trust me.

01:05:53.450 --> 01:05:55.185
There's a little something
extra in this

01:05:55.219 --> 01:05:57.187
box that you're gonna love.

01:05:57.221 --> 01:05:58.989
Oh, is it garlic bread?

01:06:03.027 --> 01:06:05.462
Well, well...

01:06:05.495 --> 01:06:08.598
Aw, it's just stupid Top Cat!

01:06:09.033 --> 01:06:13.670
You've been a nuisance
to me and my operation, cat.

01:06:13.703 --> 01:06:16.173
And you're gonna pay...

01:06:16.206 --> 01:06:17.741
with your life.

01:06:18.342 --> 01:06:21.245
Allow me to talk you into more
interesting ways of collecting.

01:06:21.278 --> 01:06:23.647
-I can offer you...
-Quiet!

01:06:23.680 --> 01:06:25.349
-Bla-bla-bla!

01:06:25.715 --> 01:06:27.551
Now let's make a deal.

01:06:27.751 --> 01:06:30.287
You get Top Cat, and I get
Benny.

01:06:30.487 --> 01:06:33.557
I've got a score
to settle with that fur ball.

01:06:33.590 --> 01:06:34.624
Get me out of here.

01:06:34.658 --> 01:06:37.294
-Ooh, one second.

01:06:37.327 --> 01:06:39.529
I've got a score
to settle with that fur ball.

01:06:39.829 --> 01:06:43.600
A personal vendetta, eh?

01:06:43.633 --> 01:06:45.769
I like your style.

01:06:46.770 --> 01:06:48.538
Move it, you're free!

01:06:48.805 --> 01:06:50.174
I'm free?

01:06:50.207 --> 01:06:51.341
Yay!

01:06:52.409 --> 01:06:54.178
Wait, what's the catch?

01:06:54.211 --> 01:06:56.480
He's probably going to kill you.

01:06:58.248 --> 01:07:02.719
Alright, hand over Top Cat.

01:07:02.752 --> 01:07:04.254
Not just yet.

01:07:04.288 --> 01:07:07.291
I also want the reward money!

01:07:07.624 --> 01:07:09.759
You want both?

01:07:11.861 --> 01:07:17.301
-He wants both!

01:07:19.736 --> 01:07:22.272
A-ha, ha,ha,ha...

01:07:22.306 --> 01:07:24.408
A-ha, eh...!

01:07:24.874 --> 01:07:26.343
You can have one.

01:07:26.576 --> 01:07:28.678
Fine, I'll take Benny.

01:07:28.712 --> 01:07:30.614
All right, I'm free!

01:07:30.647 --> 01:07:32.149
Come on.

01:07:32.182 --> 01:07:33.783
Just one more thing.

01:07:33.817 --> 01:07:35.652
If you found Top Cat,

01:07:35.685 --> 01:07:39.223
then you found my diamonds too.

01:07:39.256 --> 01:07:40.757
Hand them over.

01:07:41.358 --> 01:07:42.559
Now!

01:07:43.427 --> 01:07:45.629
Here you go, boss.

01:07:45.662 --> 01:07:49.466
Yes, my diamonds.

01:07:49.499 --> 01:07:51.568
Come to papa!

01:07:51.601 --> 01:07:54.238
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!

01:07:55.505 --> 01:07:57.507
See what he wants
with the blue one.

01:07:57.541 --> 01:08:02.078
And then,
take care of him permanently.

01:08:04.248 --> 01:08:05.615
This is it Fancy.

01:08:05.649 --> 01:08:07.351
Your shining moment.

01:08:13.323 --> 01:08:15.392
Help!

01:08:15.425 --> 01:08:16.792
You've got to help me!

01:08:16.826 --> 01:08:20.197
Help, someone help! Me...

01:08:20.229 --> 01:08:21.831
Top Cat!
Why won't anyone help me?

01:08:22.232 --> 01:08:25.335
Me! Fan... I mean, Top Cat!

01:08:25.368 --> 01:08:26.403
Got ya!

01:08:26.636 --> 01:08:28.705
Hey, what's going on?

01:08:28.938 --> 01:08:30.774
Mind your own business!

01:08:31.207 --> 01:08:34.478
This cat is mine, all mine!

01:08:34.511 --> 01:08:35.812
Wait a minute!

01:08:35.845 --> 01:08:38.682
That's the guy
from the wanted posters!

01:08:40.649 --> 01:08:42.586
And the reward
is fifty-thousand dollars!

01:08:44.188 --> 01:08:45.322
I want that reward!

01:08:45.589 --> 01:08:47.491
No, I want that reward.

01:08:47.524 --> 01:08:48.825
He wants the reward.

01:08:50.960 --> 01:08:54.331
Well, too bad,
because I found him first!

01:08:54.663 --> 01:08:57.867
-Hey!
-Please, everyone, calm down.

01:08:57.901 --> 01:08:59.102
Look closely.

01:08:59.135 --> 01:09:02.272
It doesn't say that only one
person can collect the reward.

01:09:02.305 --> 01:09:05.242
Why, technically, you can each
get fifty-thousand dollars...

01:09:05.274 --> 01:09:07.310
-for turning me in!
- Hold on a second!

01:09:07.344 --> 01:09:10.145
It almost sounds
like you want to get caught!

01:09:12.816 --> 01:09:14.518
Anyone else
think I want to get caught?

01:09:14.551 --> 01:09:16.353
-No, man, it's cool.
-Good.

01:09:16.386 --> 01:09:17.720
Get him!

01:09:20.689 --> 01:09:23.627
Help, someone help, help please!

01:09:23.660 --> 01:09:25.895
Hey, what's Top Cat doing here?

01:09:26.363 --> 01:09:28.398
Help, they're right after me!

01:09:28.932 --> 01:09:31.435
I'll explain later. Keep moving!

01:09:31.468 --> 01:09:33.870
Hey, what's that cat
doing in here?

01:09:33.903 --> 01:09:36.773
Oh, I'll escape deeper
into my enemy's hideout.

01:09:38.875 --> 01:09:42.446
I want Top Cat's blood.

01:09:48.318 --> 01:09:49.886
I'll save you, Top Cat!

01:09:49.919 --> 01:09:52.421
No, Benny, come back here!

01:09:52.456 --> 01:09:54.391
Hey, come back here, you!

01:09:55.425 --> 01:09:57.494
- Ouch, oh, ow, ouch!
-Bienvenue.

01:09:58.828 --> 01:10:00.664
Table for three-hundred?

01:10:00.864 --> 01:10:02.832
Come on, he went this way!

01:10:03.300 --> 01:10:05.702
Oh, hey, a pizza crumble!

01:10:05.735 --> 01:10:08.338
Hey, is there any chance
you can pass me some Parmesan?

01:10:08.372 --> 01:10:10.274
Hm, crunchy, not bad...

01:10:10.307 --> 01:10:12.676
Shut up, cat!
I've had it with you!

01:10:12.709 --> 01:10:15.379
Everyone shoot that box
and spare no ammo!

01:10:15.412 --> 01:10:17.981
On my count. One, two...

01:10:27.023 --> 01:10:29.559
- I'll save you, Top Cat!
-Benny!

01:10:30.927 --> 01:10:32.662
What are you doing?

01:10:32.696 --> 01:10:34.364
We caught Top Cat.

01:10:34.398 --> 01:10:37.301
And we each came
to collect the 50 grand!

01:10:37.501 --> 01:10:40.704
You idiots! That's not Top Cat!

01:10:40.737 --> 01:10:45.309
I already have Top Cat
trapped inside this box!

01:10:45.342 --> 01:10:47.411
I'm too handsome to die!

01:10:47.611 --> 01:10:50.013
Shoot that box already!

01:10:57.554 --> 01:10:58.988
Ouch!

01:10:59.889 --> 01:11:01.325
Top Cat?

01:11:03.760 --> 01:11:06.296
Have you forgotten good old me?

01:11:06.330 --> 01:11:08.565
Anyone around, anyone?

01:11:09.399 --> 01:11:11.835
No, no!

01:11:11.868 --> 01:11:14.604
Where is Top Cat?

01:11:14.638 --> 01:11:17.574
May I have
your attention, please?

01:11:17.907 --> 01:11:21.745
So you've all decided to pursue
a career on bounty hunting.

01:11:21.778 --> 01:11:23.313
A wise choice.

01:11:23.347 --> 01:11:26.015
But why settle for a
measly 50 grand?

01:11:26.049 --> 01:11:30.387
Ha! I, my fine friends,
can offer you something better!

01:11:30.420 --> 01:11:33.623
Wow! Something better
is almost always better!

01:11:33.657 --> 01:11:34.691
What have you got, bud?

01:11:35.124 --> 01:11:39.796
Everyone get out of my place
and shut that guy up!

01:11:39.829 --> 01:11:41.865
-Shh!
-Huh?

01:11:43.066 --> 01:11:44.501
Please continue.

01:11:44.901 --> 01:11:47.871
-A priceless burial masks.

01:11:47.904 --> 01:11:49.406
Straight from the grave

01:11:49.439 --> 01:11:50.740
-to your door!

01:11:50.774 --> 01:11:52.041
It's like having an
Egyptian king

01:11:52.075 --> 01:11:53.042
right in your own home,

01:11:53.076 --> 01:11:55.712
but without the stench
of his rotting corpse.

01:11:55.745 --> 01:11:58.915
I always wanted to be buried
in an Egyptian mask!

01:11:58.948 --> 01:12:00.650
What else are you offering?

01:12:00.684 --> 01:12:02.051
-Bars of gold!

01:12:02.085 --> 01:12:05.021
Each one more... goldier
than the last!

01:12:05.422 --> 01:12:08.091
Hey, how do I know
that's real gold?

01:12:09.559 --> 01:12:10.827
Wow!

01:12:11.160 --> 01:12:14.030
That is real gold!

01:12:14.464 --> 01:12:17.100
And you all thought that
50 thousand dollars was a lot?

01:12:18.735 --> 01:12:22.005
Well, how about
fifty thousand and one!

01:12:26.876 --> 01:12:28.344
But tell us,

01:12:28.645 --> 01:12:31.781
just how can we obtain
such precious items?

01:12:31.815 --> 01:12:33.850
Bring Mr. Big in to the police!

01:12:33.883 --> 01:12:37.987
But act now, because
this offer ends in two minutes!

01:12:43.560 --> 01:12:44.561
Oh no!

01:12:45.462 --> 01:12:48.097
What are you doing?
Get away from me!

01:12:50.967 --> 01:12:52.569
What are you waiting for?

01:12:52.769 --> 01:12:54.971
Take care of Top Cat's gang!

01:12:55.004 --> 01:12:57.874
You made big mistake.

01:13:01.044 --> 01:13:03.046
Oh! Was that French?

01:13:03.447 --> 01:13:06.082
I never could resist French!

01:13:10.520 --> 01:13:12.021
Oh! Ooh la-la!

01:13:12.055 --> 01:13:13.890
You know? You're actually
quite beautiful.

01:13:19.596 --> 01:13:21.097
Say goodbye!

01:13:21.130 --> 01:13:24.100
No, stay! Bad Dog! Bad Dog!
Bad Dog!

01:13:25.802 --> 01:13:27.837
-Cheese it!

01:13:32.776 --> 01:13:34.043
Ow! Ow!

01:13:40.617 --> 01:13:42.752
Ah, Mop Fu!

01:14:03.707 --> 01:14:04.741
Huh?

01:14:17.821 --> 01:14:21.024
You know, Mr. Big?
I feel sorry for you.

01:14:21.290 --> 01:14:24.460
You have money, power
and priceless treasures.

01:14:24.694 --> 01:14:28.064
But you don't have the one thing
that really matters.

01:14:29.098 --> 01:14:30.534
Friends.

01:14:30.967 --> 01:14:33.102
Friends like mine.

01:14:37.073 --> 01:14:39.208
Huh? Nooooooo...!

01:14:47.784 --> 01:14:49.853
I really should've thought
of a better line.

01:14:49.886 --> 01:14:51.721
The friends thing
was kind of cheesy.

01:14:51.755 --> 01:14:53.189
Oh, oh, I know!

01:14:53.222 --> 01:14:55.258
Hey, hey, Mr. Big...

01:15:00.063 --> 01:15:01.998
Yeah, that's better.

01:15:06.035 --> 01:15:08.204
Thanks for saving me, TC.

01:15:08.738 --> 01:15:11.875
Of course Benny, you're part
of my crew.

01:15:11.908 --> 01:15:13.276
I mean, our crew.

01:15:13.677 --> 01:15:15.579
And we never leave a man behind.

01:15:15.879 --> 01:15:19.916
Well, here, I hope you can
accept my apology.

01:15:22.852 --> 01:15:25.188
Apology accepted, friend!

01:15:25.655 --> 01:15:27.190
Well, with Mr. Big
taken care of,

01:15:27.223 --> 01:15:29.993
we are free to do what we want.

01:15:30.026 --> 01:15:31.561
But what do we want?

01:15:31.595 --> 01:15:33.296
I'll tell you what we want!

01:15:33.329 --> 01:15:36.566
To start a new life
in an amazing new place!

01:15:36.600 --> 01:15:39.603
Meet me in an hour
and I'll explain everything!

01:15:39.636 --> 01:15:42.138
I've got something to do first.

01:15:45.675 --> 01:15:47.844
What!? Dibble!? I fired you!

01:15:47.877 --> 01:15:49.012
What are you doing here?

01:15:49.045 --> 01:15:51.314
What are any of you
doing in here?

01:15:57.887 --> 01:15:59.956
Can someone who talks

01:15:59.989 --> 01:16:01.958
please tell me what's going on?

01:16:03.192 --> 01:16:04.360
Chief

01:16:04.393 --> 01:16:08.331
we caught the nasty beast
who's been terrorizing the city.

01:16:08.364 --> 01:16:10.667
You caught my mother-in-law?

01:16:14.971 --> 01:16:16.305
That's rich!

01:16:16.773 --> 01:16:19.676
No, no, seriously though, no.
We caught...

01:16:19.709 --> 01:16:20.910
Mr. Big.

01:16:22.078 --> 01:16:24.714
Nice work! We've been trying
to bring him in for years!

01:16:24.914 --> 01:16:27.884
Mr. Big, your reign
of crime is over!

01:16:27.917 --> 01:16:30.153
And, Dibble,
you're back on the force!

01:16:30.186 --> 01:16:31.821
Thanks, Chief!

01:16:31.855 --> 01:16:34.190
Hey! What about our reward?

01:16:34.223 --> 01:16:35.692
Reward, what reward?

01:16:36.325 --> 01:16:37.994
Dibble!

01:16:47.937 --> 01:16:51.240
Oh, this is the perfect
shiny spot for you.

01:16:58.181 --> 01:17:02.351
Woah, woah, why all this meowing
and crying, shorties?

01:17:02.385 --> 01:17:05.789
They're closing the orphanage
'cause we can't pay the rent.

01:17:05.822 --> 01:17:09.726
Yes, and teacher says we must
have a plant-a-tree-day...

01:17:09.759 --> 01:17:12.729
so we can remember
something good happened today.

01:17:12.762 --> 01:17:15.364
Well, yes,
we'll remember the tree,

01:17:15.398 --> 01:17:17.701
because
we are going to live under it.

01:17:17.734 --> 01:17:20.003
Wait, wait a second,
glum shorties!

01:17:20.036 --> 01:17:21.805
You can't plant trees in here!

01:17:21.838 --> 01:17:24.040
You see, I'm with the city's
department of pipelines.

01:17:24.073 --> 01:17:25.875
And we're standing over
the city's main

01:17:25.909 --> 01:17:27.744
Jell-O distribution center.

01:17:27.777 --> 01:17:28.978
Oh man!

01:17:29.178 --> 01:17:32.181
We won't even have
a tree to live under!

01:17:33.416 --> 01:17:36.052
Hey, it's gonna be okay.

01:17:38.354 --> 01:17:40.423
Hey, kids, what do you know?

01:17:40.456 --> 01:17:43.827
I was holding my map
upside down.

01:17:43.860 --> 01:17:44.994
No pipes here.

01:17:45.028 --> 01:17:47.063
Go, go dig yourselves crazy.

01:17:52.368 --> 01:17:54.771
- Look!
- Diamonds!

01:17:54.804 --> 01:17:55.905
We found diamonds!

01:17:55.939 --> 01:17:56.773
Yeah!

01:17:59.408 --> 01:18:01.077
-We're saved!
-We're rich!

01:18:01.110 --> 01:18:03.112
-Well done!
-Tell me about it!

01:18:03.379 --> 01:18:04.948
The orphanage is saved!

01:18:05.248 --> 01:18:06.916
We have a home!

01:18:09.018 --> 01:18:10.286
Oh, yeah!

01:18:11.087 --> 01:18:13.422
Hey, TC,
we're ready to start our

01:18:13.456 --> 01:18:15.992
new lives in our
fancy new place!

01:18:16.025 --> 01:18:17.126
Yeah!

01:18:21.765 --> 01:18:26.335
Err... About that fancy
new place, uh...

01:18:27.804 --> 01:18:28.938
It's here!

01:18:33.076 --> 01:18:36.980
-Looks homey!
-It has a rustic romance to it!

01:18:37.013 --> 01:18:39.883
Did I mention
how homey and rustic it looks?

01:18:40.383 --> 01:18:43.419
I was afraid we'd be
in some sell-out penthouse, man!

01:18:43.452 --> 01:18:46.422
It's good to have friends,
isn't it, TC?

01:18:46.455 --> 01:18:48.124
Friends, you guys?

01:18:48.157 --> 01:18:49.826
You're not my friends!

01:18:51.327 --> 01:18:53.162
You're my family.

01:18:55.799 --> 01:18:57.967
You mean it TC, are you sure?

01:18:58.001 --> 01:19:01.537
Of course, as sure
as my name is Top Cat!

01:19:01.570 --> 01:19:04.207
-Hey, what do you know?

01:19:05.441 --> 01:19:07.043
Trumpets!

01:19:26.295 --> 01:19:28.197
Eh... who's next?
