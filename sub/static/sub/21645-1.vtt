WEBVTT

01:50.840 --> 01:53.719
Elphinstone has given
the order to retreat, Duke.

01:53.880 --> 01:56.679
They should reach Jalalabad within a month.

01:56.840 --> 02:00.277
In January? The weather will be closing in.

02:01.400 --> 02:05.599
Through the Khyber Pass,
they will be single file in places.

02:05.760 --> 02:08.479
- Damned easy to ambush.
- I'm afraid there is no alternative.

02:08.639 --> 02:11.678
Elphinstone believes
the Kabul garrison to be indefensible.

02:11.840 --> 02:14.799
He has no choice, sir.
They have been guaranteed safe passage.

02:14.960 --> 02:17.475
I wouldn't put my faith in Afghan promises.

02:18.080 --> 02:23.439
Thank you, gentlemen. I see no reason
to trouble the Queen with this.

02:24.240 --> 02:27.597
I do not want to distress her
at this delicate time.

02:33.520 --> 02:35.239
Ma'am.

02:53.880 --> 02:56.031
This is ridiculous.

02:57.080 --> 02:59.834
Drina, it is too dangerous, please!

03:00.000 --> 03:04.279
I may have had a baby but I am quite
capable of walking down the stairs.

03:12.640 --> 03:15.280
Huh. Victoria.

03:20.920 --> 03:23.355
Is this wise, to be out of bed?

03:23.520 --> 03:25.113
Sir James said at least a month.

03:25.280 --> 03:28.318
This is what I'm telling her, Albert.
But she doesn't listen to me.

03:29.000 --> 03:32.072
I'm not going to stay in that chair
for a moment longer.

03:35.200 --> 03:37.476
Your Majesty.

03:37.640 --> 03:40.519
Albert, let's go out. Let's
go out into the fresh air.

03:40.680 --> 03:44.196
- I want to go riding.
- Riding? Are you sure?

03:44.360 --> 03:46.158
Yes, of course I'm sure.

03:46.320 --> 03:49.552
Erm, Forgive me, ma'am.
I am afraid it will be most irregular

03:49.720 --> 03:53.350
for you to appear in public
before you have been churched.

03:53.520 --> 03:55.989
Churched?

03:56.160 --> 04:00.234
Your Majesty. It is customary
for a woman who has had a child

04:00.400 --> 04:03.711
to be purified in church
before she rejoins society.

04:04.840 --> 04:06.877
- And you are?
- Drummond, Ma'am.

04:07.040 --> 04:09.396
Sir Robert's private secretary.

04:10.120 --> 04:13.955
Well, Mr Drummond, I am not a woman.
I am a queen.

04:14.120 --> 04:15.918
Hm.

04:17.440 --> 04:20.160
Almighty God,
we give thee humble thanks

04:20.320 --> 04:23.472
that thou hast vouchsafed
to deliver this woman

04:23.640 --> 04:29.511
from the pain and peril of childbirth,
and cast out her sin.

04:29.680 --> 04:31.956
The peace and blessing of God Almighty,

04:32.120 --> 04:35.397
the Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost,

04:35.560 --> 04:38.280
descend upon thee, and remain for ever.

04:38.440 --> 04:39.920
Amen.

04:43.800 --> 04:47.635
What does the Archbishop know about
the pain and peril of childbirth?

04:47.800 --> 04:50.520
The ignominy of having to kneel
in front of that old man

04:50.680 --> 04:53.832
as if I had committed some sin,
instead of having a baby!

04:54.520 --> 04:56.751
Such a charming ceremony.

04:56.920 --> 04:59.913
I remember how it was after
I had you, Victoria.

05:00.080 --> 05:04.916
To be welcomed back into the Church
after receiving such a gift from God.

05:06.520 --> 05:08.591
God had nothing to do with it.

05:26.720 --> 05:28.791
I won! I won!

05:30.320 --> 05:34.030
Oh, I have missed this so much.

05:34.960 --> 05:37.077
Let's go round again.

05:37.480 --> 05:39.870
But there is so much to do.

05:44.200 --> 05:45.600
Go!

05:45.760 --> 05:48.400
Oh... Albert! Albert, wait!

05:48.560 --> 05:50.836
You couldn't beat me
even with a head start.

05:51.000 --> 05:53.959
Perhaps I know how happy
it makes you to win, Liebes.

06:00.600 --> 06:02.592
I've missed this, too.

06:22.520 --> 06:24.477
Not now, Lehzen.

06:26.520 --> 06:30.070
Mein kleines Madchen.
What beautiful blue eyes you have.

06:30.240 --> 06:32.835
All babies have blue eyes, Albert.

06:40.080 --> 06:42.436
I think you should come down to
the kitchens, Mr Penge.

06:42.600 --> 06:44.353
Mr Craddock has struck a kitchen maid.

06:44.520 --> 06:46.239
Can't you see I'm busy, Brodie?

06:46.400 --> 06:48.153
He has a knife, Mr Penge.

06:48.320 --> 06:51.552
- You are in deep trouble, my dear!
- May I remind you, Mr Craddock,

06:51.720 --> 06:54.280
that this is Buckingham Palace, not Bedlam!

06:54.440 --> 06:56.591
You will give me that knife.

06:56.760 --> 07:00.436
It may be a Palace upstairs but down
here it's no better than a rookery.

07:00.600 --> 07:04.514
I caught her red-handed in the pantry
with a loaf in her hand.

07:04.680 --> 07:06.956
I was just taking the stale bread
for Dash's dinner.

07:07.120 --> 07:09.112
Mr Francatelli always
said just go and get it.

07:09.280 --> 07:13.593
- But I am not Mr Francatelli.
- Indeed you are not, Mr Craddock!

07:13.760 --> 07:15.240
The knife.

07:18.120 --> 07:20.555
Everyone, get back to work.

08:05.320 --> 08:07.471
Ma'am.

08:07.640 --> 08:09.757
I'm so glad you've made a full recovery.

08:09.920 --> 08:12.196
I feel much better
now I'm back at work, Lord Alfred.

08:12.360 --> 08:15.034
Confinement... does not suit me.

08:15.200 --> 08:19.194
Then, Ma'am, may I ask you to look
at my brother Septimus's commission?

08:19.360 --> 08:21.192
It should be on the Army List.

08:21.360 --> 08:24.398
Albert has been doing the
boxes in my absence.

08:24.560 --> 08:26.472
I'm sure he would have approved it, though.

08:26.640 --> 08:29.360
Thank you, Ma'am. It's much appreciated.

08:38.320 --> 08:40.755
Sir. Despatch from General Ellenburgh.

08:41.720 --> 08:43.712
Thank you.

08:56.400 --> 08:58.437
Albert. There you are.

08:59.560 --> 09:01.074
Do you have the boxes?

09:01.240 --> 09:02.230
- Boxes?
- Yes.

09:02.400 --> 09:04.960
- I have so much to catch up on.
- Ah, no. Do not worry.

09:05.120 --> 09:06.679
I've already gone through them.

09:06.840 --> 09:08.991
I've summarised my findings
in this memorandum.

09:09.160 --> 09:12.836
Thank you, my angel, but I should
like the boxes to be sent to me,

09:13.000 --> 09:15.071
- so I can... I can master the detail.
- Of course.

09:15.240 --> 09:18.438
So long as you do not think
you will wear yourself out.

09:19.200 --> 09:21.271
I think I can manage.

09:30.000 --> 09:33.994
To be honest, Miss Skerrett, I do not think
you're ready for the Chief Dresser's position.

09:34.160 --> 09:37.517
However... I have spoken to the Queen

09:37.680 --> 09:41.196
and, for some reason,
she thinks you should replace Mrs Jenkins.

09:42.280 --> 09:45.956
<i>I hope you will justify
Her Majesty's faith in you, Mrs Skerrett.</i>

09:46.920 --> 09:48.798
But I ain't married, Baroness.

09:48.960 --> 09:51.475
Oh, neither was Mrs Jenkins.

09:51.640 --> 09:54.200
Not to a man, that is.

10:03.880 --> 10:06.156
I remembered you dress to the left, sir.

10:06.320 --> 10:08.960
The fit should be nice and snug now.

10:09.120 --> 10:10.520
Thank you.

10:14.000 --> 10:15.593
It fits you perfectly.

10:15.760 --> 10:18.229
I'm glad it has your royal approval.

10:24.440 --> 10:26.796
Where are you going all dressed up?

10:28.280 --> 10:30.920
To inspect my regiment.

10:31.080 --> 10:32.594
The 11th Hussars?

10:33.960 --> 10:35.758
It won't take me long to get ready.

10:35.920 --> 10:37.832
You want to come with me?

10:40.160 --> 10:42.914
It may be your regiment, Albert,
but it is my army.

11:09.600 --> 11:14.391
It does the men good to see their Queen,
and Lord knows we need to keep morale high

11:14.560 --> 11:17.280
if the rumours from Afghanistan are true.

11:17.920 --> 11:20.196
Has anyone told the Queen?

11:22.280 --> 11:25.990
The Prince still feels there is
no need to worry Her Majesty...

11:26.160 --> 11:28.470
so soon after her confinement.

11:30.360 --> 11:32.955
She looks robust enough to me.

11:33.120 --> 11:35.157
But you are Prime Minister now, Peel.

11:45.880 --> 11:48.076
The uniforms are magnificent.

11:48.240 --> 11:51.074
But are they practical
in the field of battle?

11:51.240 --> 11:55.359
The helmets, for example.
The plumes, they are... irrelevant.

11:56.800 --> 11:58.837
But so splendid.

12:00.880 --> 12:04.351
I do not think this uniform
is designed for modern warfare.

12:04.520 --> 12:07.718
But I think I would feel brave wearing it.

12:07.880 --> 12:09.712
God save the Queen!

12:09.880 --> 12:13.271
God save the Queen!
God save the Queen!

12:13.440 --> 12:15.636
God save the Queen!

12:16.640 --> 12:19.075
I am glad to see Your
Majesty fully recovered.

12:19.240 --> 12:22.233
How fortunate you are to have
such an able... substitute.

12:22.400 --> 12:24.869
I try to be of service.

12:26.760 --> 12:28.831
I was wondering, Ma'am,

12:29.000 --> 12:31.674
if you have come to a decision
regarding your ladies?

12:31.840 --> 12:33.513
More than that, Sir Robert.

12:33.680 --> 12:35.592
The new Mistress of the
Robes arrives today.

12:35.760 --> 12:39.197
Oh, and might I enquire
as to whom you have chosen?

12:39.360 --> 12:41.591
The Duchess of Buccleuch.

12:42.560 --> 12:44.040
Have you met her, Ma'am?

12:44.200 --> 12:45.680
No.

12:46.920 --> 12:49.151
I have met
all your other suggestions, Sir Robert.

12:49.320 --> 12:52.119
- She was on your list.
- At the very bottom.

12:52.280 --> 12:55.398
- I hardly think...
- If you will excuse me.

13:04.400 --> 13:06.119
- Ma'am.
- Ma'am.

13:46.520 --> 13:48.671
May I, Ma'am?

13:58.640 --> 14:00.996
I wanted to see the Princess before I go.

14:04.840 --> 14:06.433
I like watching her sleep.

14:06.600 --> 14:09.911
When my children were babies,
it was my favourite time too.

14:15.520 --> 14:17.557
Did you like them...

14:18.640 --> 14:20.791
.. straightaway?

14:22.400 --> 14:25.199
Well, I was pleased they were healthy,

14:25.360 --> 14:29.877
I would have killed anyone that
caused them any harm, but like them?

14:30.040 --> 14:31.679
I think that comes later, Ma'am.

14:33.200 --> 14:36.477
Having a baby is a sacrifice
as well as a blessing.

14:45.560 --> 14:47.870
I will miss you, Harriet.

14:48.720 --> 14:51.155
But you must come to the christening.

14:51.920 --> 14:54.674
You're so good with my Coburg in-laws.

14:57.440 --> 14:59.591
Your carriage is here, Harriet.

15:12.520 --> 15:14.591
Till the christening, then.

15:33.800 --> 15:37.430
Your Majesty, The Duchess of Buccleuch

15:37.600 --> 15:40.434
and the Honourable Wilhelmina Coke.

15:51.120 --> 15:53.351
Your Majesty.

15:54.360 --> 15:56.352
Welcome to Buckingham Palace, Duchess.

15:56.520 --> 15:58.910
Oh, I have been here before, Ma'am.

15:59.080 --> 16:01.993
Serving Queen Adelaide.

16:02.160 --> 16:04.470
Such a great lady.

16:04.840 --> 16:07.912
May I introduce my niece, Wilhelmina,

16:08.080 --> 16:10.390
as your Maid of Honour.

16:11.400 --> 16:13.710
Keep your back straight.

16:13.880 --> 16:15.758
- Madam...
- Oh.

16:18.160 --> 16:21.870
May I show you and Miss Coke
to your apartments, Duchess?

16:33.720 --> 16:36.838
I expect you remember the palace
from before, Duchess.

16:37.000 --> 16:38.992
In my day, it was only a house...

16:41.160 --> 16:43.516
.. but at least it was clean.

17:00.240 --> 17:05.359
My valet tells me that your new Mistress
of the Robes does not like her rooms.

17:08.280 --> 17:11.671
Why aren't we going to
the commissioning of HMS Trafalgar?

17:13.880 --> 17:15.758
I went through those boxes this morning.

17:15.920 --> 17:19.117
I know, Albert, but it is
a very good thing I did.

17:19.280 --> 17:22.239
You forgot to put Septimus Paget
on the list of new commissions.

17:22.400 --> 17:25.393
I did not forget. I did
not find him suitable.

17:26.560 --> 17:29.280
But he is quite charming,
like all his family.

17:29.440 --> 17:32.831
Lord M always says
every officers' mess needs a Paget.

17:33.000 --> 17:36.880
If Lord Melbourne understood that charm's
not the most important trait in a soldier,

17:37.040 --> 17:39.874
then perhaps we would not be
retreating from Kabul.

17:40.640 --> 17:42.996
Retreating from Kabul?

17:43.480 --> 17:46.075
Well, why didn't you tell me?

17:46.240 --> 17:49.312
- I... I did not want to alarm you.
- Not alarm me?

17:49.480 --> 17:53.713
Albert... they'll be going through
the Khyber Pass in winter.

17:53.880 --> 17:56.714
- You know about the Khyber Pass?
- Of course I know about it.

17:56.880 --> 17:59.190
Well, it is no reason
for concern, Victoria.

17:59.360 --> 18:01.636
It is only a strategic redeployment.

18:01.800 --> 18:03.792
Really?

18:08.320 --> 18:11.040
They are my soldiers, Albert.
I need to know these things.

18:11.200 --> 18:12.634
You have no right to keep it from me!

18:12.800 --> 18:15.838
Forgive me.
I was only trying to make your life easier.

18:16.000 --> 18:18.993
Is that what you were doing?
You and Robert Peel?

18:19.160 --> 18:21.356
You always seem very cosy together.

18:21.520 --> 18:23.398
We have many common interests.

18:23.560 --> 18:26.598
You know, he appreciates my ideas
for reforming the army.

18:26.760 --> 18:28.160
For improving the uniform.

18:28.320 --> 18:32.360
He also agrees that an officer should only
be promoted on grounds of merit alone

18:32.520 --> 18:36.560
and he was most complimentary
about my helmet designs.

18:38.040 --> 18:40.350
I don't give a fig about your helmets.

18:43.640 --> 18:45.757
- Where are you going?
- To the nursery.

18:46.760 --> 18:48.717
Isn't that where you think I belong?

18:58.200 --> 19:01.238
Have you read The Old Curiosity Shop
by Mr Dickens, Ma'am?

19:01.400 --> 19:03.596
I believe it is much admired.

19:03.760 --> 19:06.070
I've just got to the death of Little Nell.

19:06.240 --> 19:09.438
Oh... it is so poignant, Ma'am.

19:09.600 --> 19:11.796
I thought I would never stop crying.

19:11.960 --> 19:14.873
Crying over a book.
I've never heard such a thing.

19:15.040 --> 19:20.320
In my day, no unmarried girl
would be allowed to read novels.

19:29.480 --> 19:32.632
I thought you might like
to see the princess, Majesty.

19:47.440 --> 19:50.717
Oh, Lehzen, look. She's smiling at me.

19:50.880 --> 19:53.190
Wind, more likely.

20:03.040 --> 20:06.795
You had better sit next
to me, Mrs Skerrett.

20:08.600 --> 20:10.034
I'm married to the job now, Brodie.

20:10.200 --> 20:12.760
Let's hope you prove more faithful
than your predecessor.

20:12.920 --> 20:16.470
I suppose you will be
looking for an assistant now.

20:18.480 --> 20:20.312
I'm sure the Baroness will have ideas.

20:20.480 --> 20:23.917
Even the Baroness can make mistakes...

20:24.080 --> 20:26.436
from time to time.

20:26.600 --> 20:29.479
- Good afternoon, Lord Alfred.
- Your Majesty.

20:29.640 --> 20:31.791
I wanted to tell you...

20:32.720 --> 20:35.030
.. that your brother's commission
has gone through.

20:35.200 --> 20:37.635
Oh, I cannot thank you enough, Ma'am.

20:38.480 --> 20:40.676
Septimus is quite my favourite brother.

20:40.840 --> 20:44.151
I'm sure he will do very well.
Tell me, have you seen the Prince?

20:44.320 --> 20:48.473
Why yes, Ma'am, I passed him
just now, talking to the Prime Minister.

20:49.400 --> 20:52.916
Ambushed at Gandamak,
according to the latest despatch.

20:53.080 --> 20:55.834
Good afternoon, Your Majesty.

20:56.000 --> 20:59.596
Sorry to interrupt you. I do wonder what
it is you're discussing so earnestly.

21:00.280 --> 21:04.559
Army reform? Or perhaps it is
the situation in Afghanistan?

21:05.520 --> 21:08.354
I do have some interest
in these matters, Sir Robert.

21:08.520 --> 21:10.000
I'm a soldier's daughter.

21:10.160 --> 21:14.518
The Prince and I were discussing
the new Sanitation Commission, Ma'am.

21:14.680 --> 21:16.512
The Commissioner, a Mr Chadwick,

21:16.680 --> 21:19.991
has some quite radical thoughts
about the London sewers.

21:20.160 --> 21:22.436
Would you care to hear them?

21:23.600 --> 21:26.354
I'm sure Albert will
explain it to me later.

21:27.840 --> 21:29.194
Is there any news from Kabul?

21:29.360 --> 21:34.435
Nothing... Nothing reliable.
The mails are uncommon slow.

21:35.520 --> 21:38.592
When you do get word, I want to know.
Immediately.

21:40.080 --> 21:42.879
I hope you don't mind being outside, Duke.

21:43.040 --> 21:46.351
A soldier is used to marching
in cold weather, Ma'am.

21:49.160 --> 21:51.755
I have asked you here, because...

21:51.920 --> 21:54.435
I want to know how things
are in Afghanistan.

21:56.320 --> 21:58.198
About as bad as they can be, Ma'am.

21:58.360 --> 22:02.434
Macnaghten, the envoy,
hacked to pieces by Afghans in Kabul.

22:03.280 --> 22:06.637
And that fool Elphinstone,
instead of getting the hell out of there,

22:06.800 --> 22:08.871
dithered until the snows came in.

22:10.120 --> 22:12.680
4,000 men we had in Kabul.

22:17.120 --> 22:19.077
Let's hope they get home safely.

22:19.240 --> 22:21.436
It sounds like a defeat.

22:24.800 --> 22:29.795
No-one wants to call it that,
but yes, Ma'am, that's what it is.

22:34.200 --> 22:38.080
Afghanistan is a wretched,
Godforsaken place.

22:38.240 --> 22:41.870
Nothing but rocks and sand
and tribesmen who fight like tigers.

22:42.040 --> 22:43.952
We should have left well alone.

22:44.120 --> 22:48.319
Thank you, Duke...
for being so candid with me.

22:48.480 --> 22:52.394
It's an old man's privilege.
And you should know the worst.

22:52.560 --> 22:54.711
If the army don't make it back,

22:54.880 --> 22:58.760
the country will look to
you, Ma'am, for direction.

22:59.400 --> 23:00.880
I will be ready, Duke.

23:11.920 --> 23:13.877
No, thank you.

23:14.040 --> 23:15.633
Papa?

23:15.800 --> 23:17.917
Ah, good.

23:34.360 --> 23:37.398
Why didn't you tell me Macnaghten
had been hacked to death in Kabul?

23:37.560 --> 23:39.438
Myself and Peel did not think it necessary

23:39.600 --> 23:41.831
until we had hard evidence
and a plan to retaliate.

23:42.000 --> 23:43.559
How thoughtful of you!

23:44.480 --> 23:47.996
You have no right to decide
what I should or should not know.

23:49.040 --> 23:51.760
I saw no reason to upset you
without the facts, Victoria.

23:51.920 --> 23:54.515
I am the sovereign of this country, Albert.

23:54.680 --> 23:57.036
It is not your decision to make.

23:57.200 --> 24:00.876
His Majesty, The King of the Belgians,

24:01.040 --> 24:04.750
His Grand Ducal Highness,
the Duke of Saxe-Coburg...

24:04.920 --> 24:06.877
- Dash.
-..and his Serene Highness,

24:07.040 --> 24:08.633
Prince Ernest.

24:08.800 --> 24:14.512
Oh, my dear Victoria... how well you look.

24:15.200 --> 24:16.554
Motherhood suits you.

24:16.720 --> 24:18.313
Now you will be distracted

24:18.480 --> 24:21.837
by those nursery duties
so dear to women's hearts,

24:22.000 --> 24:25.835
I hope to help dear Albert
with the burden he must be facing.

24:26.000 --> 24:27.593
I am sure he will appreciate your help

24:27.760 --> 24:31.720
on the Sanitation Commission, Uncle,
while I attend to affairs of state.

24:31.880 --> 24:33.872
I don't spend all my time in the nursery.

24:34.040 --> 24:35.679
Ah...

24:37.160 --> 24:38.958
Ah.

24:39.680 --> 24:42.878
Oh, she has the family chin.

24:43.040 --> 24:46.158
It is a pity she's only a girl, Albert.

24:46.320 --> 24:48.630
But plenty of time, eh?

24:48.800 --> 24:53.352
A fine young couple like you,
I expect a grandson by Christmas.

24:53.520 --> 24:54.590
Huh.

24:56.320 --> 25:00.997
She is a delightful baby
and almost as beautiful as her mother.

25:01.800 --> 25:05.316
- Thank you for bringing Eos.
- He missed you, so very much.

25:05.480 --> 25:07.153
I have missed him, too.

25:07.320 --> 25:10.040
Dash!

25:12.320 --> 25:14.789
Harriet was always so good with Dash.

25:14.960 --> 25:17.759
Perhaps it is a Whig talent, Ma'am.

25:18.600 --> 25:20.398
We have a new Mistress of the Robes, sir.

25:20.560 --> 25:22.392
So it seems.

25:23.440 --> 25:25.352
What happened to the last one?

25:25.520 --> 25:28.513
She went back to her husband, sir.

25:42.160 --> 25:45.437
You know, I am most surprised
by this soup. What's this?

25:45.600 --> 25:47.557
I believe it is a prune, sir.

25:47.720 --> 25:50.076
A prune? They put prunes in a soup?

25:50.240 --> 25:53.995
Cock-a-leekie soup.
A fine Scottish recipe.

25:54.160 --> 25:58.279
My late husband always swore by it
when he had an attack of the gout.

25:58.440 --> 26:01.080
So this is not a soup but a medicine?

26:01.240 --> 26:03.960
- That would explain the taste.
- Oh!

26:04.120 --> 26:05.395
Gott im Himmel!

26:05.560 --> 26:09.190
A cockscomb.
Give it a good chew, Ma'am.

26:09.360 --> 26:13.070
Nothing quite like it
for women at our time of life.

26:15.880 --> 26:18.190
What was the name of our old chef, Lehzen?

26:18.360 --> 26:20.272
Mr Francatelli, Majesty.

26:20.440 --> 26:23.831
Please tell Mr Francatelli
I would like him to return.

26:24.000 --> 26:25.992
Yes, Majesty.

26:26.160 --> 26:28.675
Another decision made in my absence.

26:31.640 --> 26:33.597
Has there been some upset?

26:33.760 --> 26:37.595
I detect that all is not well
between Victoria and Albert.

26:39.600 --> 26:41.432
Did you have to leave dinner so abruptly?

26:41.600 --> 26:43.717
I couldn't bear to sit there
for a moment longer.

26:43.880 --> 26:45.837
- Evidently!
- All I can think about, Albert,

26:46.000 --> 26:50.119
is the one man I thought I could trust -
my husband - has deceived me.

26:50.280 --> 26:52.078
Deceived you? No. No, no.

26:52.240 --> 26:56.712
There was no deception. I merely
tried to shelter you from something

26:56.880 --> 26:58.633
I thought you would find distressing.

26:58.800 --> 27:00.951
I do not need your shelter, Albert!

27:01.120 --> 27:03.635
- You have completely undermined me!
- Victoria, please.

27:03.800 --> 27:06.315
Lord Melbourne treated me
as an equal, not as some child

27:06.480 --> 27:08.073
to be protected from unpleasantness.

27:08.240 --> 27:09.959
If Lord Melbourne and Palmerston

27:10.120 --> 27:12.476
had not interfered in Afghanistan
in the first place,

27:12.640 --> 27:14.393
this debacle might never have happened!

27:14.560 --> 27:16.791
I think you are tired.
I think your mother was right.

27:16.960 --> 27:21.034
- You should have rested for longer.
- I am not tired, Albert, I am angry!

27:30.240 --> 27:32.755
Perhaps I should sleep
in my own quarters tonight.

27:32.920 --> 27:36.550
Hopefully, by the morning
you will have recovered your reason.

28:00.800 --> 28:04.396
Kinderspiel. Like gutting
the Christmas goose.

28:05.080 --> 28:07.197
I have too many battles to fight.

28:09.440 --> 28:12.080
So... Victoria?

28:12.240 --> 28:15.438
She has changed so much since the baby.

28:15.600 --> 28:17.273
I do not recognise her.

28:17.440 --> 28:19.796
She's angry with me for
not telling her the truth

28:19.960 --> 28:21.314
about the atrocities in Kabul.

28:21.480 --> 28:24.871
But I only wanted
to give her time with the baby.

28:25.040 --> 28:26.394
Respite from her position.

28:26.560 --> 28:29.758
Perhaps Victoria doesn't like you
trying to do her job.

28:31.480 --> 28:33.836
- I was only trying to help.
- Of course.

28:35.400 --> 28:38.632
But Victoria might think
that you are trying...

28:38.800 --> 28:41.190
to control her.

28:48.760 --> 28:50.752
Shall we?

28:54.000 --> 28:55.639
Thank you, Ernest.

28:59.600 --> 29:02.320
You know, I think you will make
a very good husband one day.

29:02.480 --> 29:03.994
Not much chance of that.

29:04.160 --> 29:07.119
Unless, of course,
the Duchess of Buccleuch is a widow.

29:18.520 --> 29:20.512
Your Majesty.

29:22.960 --> 29:26.078
Sir Robert asked me
to give you the Army List, Ma'am.

29:26.240 --> 29:29.153
In case you wanted to make
any more amendments.

29:31.800 --> 29:33.757
Mr Drummond?

29:33.920 --> 29:35.354
Yes, Ma'am?

29:35.520 --> 29:38.797
Is there any news of
General Elphinstone's army?

29:38.960 --> 29:40.917
Of my troops?

29:41.080 --> 29:42.753
Not to my knowledge, Ma'am.

29:44.760 --> 29:48.197
But if there is news, I want to be
the first to know, however bad!

29:49.720 --> 29:51.279
Do you understand, Mr Drummond?

29:52.080 --> 29:54.117
I do, Ma'am.

29:57.360 --> 29:59.079
Drummond.

30:02.120 --> 30:06.273
Ma'am. We should discuss the order
of ceremony for the christening.

30:10.000 --> 30:13.437
I thought that motherhood
would make her less difficult,

30:13.600 --> 30:15.080
but it has only made her worse.

30:15.240 --> 30:19.154
Ah, Albert should give her another baby.
Schnell.

30:19.320 --> 30:21.710
My dear brother,
there is no need for such coarseness.

30:21.880 --> 30:27.160
But I think I shall not leave
immediately after the christening.

30:27.320 --> 30:30.791
I have such a happy knack
of pouring oil on troubled waters.

30:30.960 --> 30:33.555
But Victoria is a tempest.

30:34.680 --> 30:36.353
Mm.

30:39.080 --> 30:42.960
The Queen is not happy with the new chef.
Do you know why Mr Francatelli left?

30:43.120 --> 30:44.793
I have no idea.

30:45.440 --> 30:47.636
But you know where he has gone?

30:48.680 --> 30:52.799
Then I would be grateful if you could tell
him that the Queen would like him to return.

30:53.480 --> 30:56.393
Oh, no, Baroness, I... I don't
think I'm the best person to...

30:56.560 --> 30:59.359
The Queen is relying on you, Mrs Skerrett.

31:27.400 --> 31:29.710
Good morning, Mr Francatelli.

31:35.440 --> 31:36.920
You look very well.

31:44.320 --> 31:47.392
You know that Mrs Jenkins left.
I am Chief Dresser now.

31:47.560 --> 31:50.200
Did... Did you come here to tell me that?

31:50.360 --> 31:52.352
Because, if so, I have a kitchen to run.

31:52.520 --> 31:53.874
No...

31:54.680 --> 31:56.911
I... I came here to ask you...

31:58.360 --> 32:02.070
.. or, rather, to tell you that the Queen
would like you to come back.

32:03.840 --> 32:05.832
Back to the palace?

32:07.320 --> 32:10.518
Well, er, you can tell Her Majesty...

32:12.040 --> 32:14.839
.. that I wouldn't come back

32:15.000 --> 32:18.277
even if she paid me
five times what I'm getting here.

32:20.720 --> 32:22.757
Wait!

32:28.320 --> 32:30.312
That day when you left...

32:32.080 --> 32:34.675
.. I came to find you, to tell you that...

32:38.280 --> 32:40.272
But I was too late.

32:42.200 --> 32:46.991
Yes, Mrs Skerrett, you were.

32:55.600 --> 33:00.277
An English princess would make
all the difference in Berlin.

33:00.440 --> 33:02.511
Prussia becomes more powerful every year

33:02.680 --> 33:05.593
and it is so important
that it develops in the right way.

33:05.760 --> 33:07.956
My daughter is not even 12 weeks old!

33:08.960 --> 33:12.431
I think that when she is of an age
to marry she will have her own ideas.

33:12.600 --> 33:15.672
Young ladies have a mind
of their own, it is true.

33:15.840 --> 33:18.719
But sometimes their elders know best.

33:19.760 --> 33:22.958
It is entirely possible
I won't have any more children...

33:23.120 --> 33:25.555
and the baby will one day be Victoria II.

33:25.720 --> 33:26.836
Oh, nonsense.

33:27.000 --> 33:30.994
Albert is my son
and he will not neglect his duties.

33:31.160 --> 33:32.594
Papa, please.

33:32.760 --> 33:34.797
I am sure that you and Albert

33:34.960 --> 33:37.998
will give your country
many princes and princesses.

33:38.160 --> 33:42.200
Actually, Uncle Leopold, what my
country needs right now is a queen...

33:43.680 --> 33:45.672
.. not a brood mare.

33:51.120 --> 33:56.673
I commend this child,
Victoria Adelaide Mary Louisa...

33:56.840 --> 33:58.797
to the care of her sponsors.

33:58.960 --> 34:01.191
Who answers for this child?

34:01.360 --> 34:04.797
Dost thou renounce the
devil and all his works,

34:04.960 --> 34:07.475
the vain pomp and glory of this world

34:07.640 --> 34:10.553
and the carnal desires of the flesh?

34:10.719 --> 34:12.438
I do.

34:24.360 --> 34:26.397
In the name of the Father,

34:26.560 --> 34:29.871
the Son and the Holy Ghost,

34:30.040 --> 34:31.952
I baptise this child.

35:04.040 --> 35:06.475
What a charming piece.

35:07.320 --> 35:09.516
I'm glad you like it.

35:10.320 --> 35:12.880
I composed it myself for the occasion.

35:13.600 --> 35:15.592
You?

35:24.280 --> 35:26.237
It is the Leaning Tower of London.

35:27.480 --> 35:30.279
Or perhaps it is a tipsy cake,
your Serene Highness.

35:30.440 --> 35:33.558
Tis a pleasure to see you again, Duchess.

35:34.280 --> 35:37.193
Er, may I present my husband, sir?

35:38.960 --> 35:40.280
Your Serene Highness.

35:40.440 --> 35:43.274
The Palace is not quite the same
without your wife, Duke.

35:43.440 --> 35:46.000
My wife is an ornament wherever she is.

35:48.200 --> 35:50.271
If you'll excuse me.

35:57.880 --> 35:58.870
Mm.

35:59.040 --> 36:01.271
This is inedible.

36:02.360 --> 36:05.194
Lehzen, when is Mr Francatelli coming back?

36:05.360 --> 36:07.352
Unfortunately, Ma'am,

36:07.520 --> 36:10.797
he does not wish to leave his
current position at the Reform Club.

36:10.960 --> 36:13.031
My apologies, Sir Robert.

36:13.200 --> 36:15.760
I thought you would want to know at once.

36:15.920 --> 36:18.037
Excuse me, Duke.

36:18.560 --> 36:22.793
You know, Ma'am, my eldest brother
is on the committee at the Reform.

36:22.960 --> 36:24.952
Lord Alfred, how many brothers do you have?

36:25.120 --> 36:27.351
Oh... seven, Ma'am.

36:28.120 --> 36:31.079
I could have a word with
William if you'd like.

36:31.240 --> 36:33.960
Oh, please. That would be very kind.

36:34.120 --> 36:36.351
Excuse me, Ma'am.

36:38.040 --> 36:43.240
I er... I hate to be the bearer of ill
tidings on such a joyous occasion,

36:43.400 --> 36:45.995
but there is something I must tell you.

36:58.320 --> 37:02.553
I'm sorry to say that the worst
has happened in Afghanistan.

37:04.000 --> 37:06.310
Despite being guaranteed safe passage,

37:06.480 --> 37:10.076
the remainder of the column was ambushed
near a village called Gandamak -

37:10.240 --> 37:11.913
and annihilated.

37:12.080 --> 37:14.197
4,000 men left Kabul.

37:14.360 --> 37:17.319
<i>There is only one survivor, a Dr Brydon.</i>

37:18.080 --> 37:20.720
<i>Despite being wounded, he managed somehow</i>

37:20.880 --> 37:24.191
<i>to make it across the border
to our garrison in Jalalabad.</i>

37:24.360 --> 37:26.716
<i>50 miles through hostile territory.</i>

37:29.320 --> 37:31.437
He's just arrived in London.

37:36.040 --> 37:39.590
I must see him... at once.

37:47.400 --> 37:52.191
One of the Gilzais
took a swing at me with his blade,

37:53.240 --> 37:56.233
but he got the Blackwood's Magazine
I'd stuffed in my hat,

37:56.400 --> 37:57.516
instead of my scalp.

37:57.680 --> 37:59.672
The paper had frozen solid.

38:00.600 --> 38:03.479
Doesn't seem right
that I should still be alive...

38:04.520 --> 38:06.830
.. when so many decent men are dead.

38:08.720 --> 38:12.191
You have been exceedingly
brave, Dr Brydon...

38:15.280 --> 38:17.397
.. and I thank you for coming here today.

38:19.640 --> 38:22.712
We all thought about
you, Ma'am, over there.

38:24.160 --> 38:26.595
My friend, Captain Souter...

38:27.800 --> 38:31.316
.. he was singing God Save The Queen
when he...

38:38.800 --> 38:40.951
.. when he was er...

38:47.280 --> 38:49.749
I wish he was beside me now.

38:59.640 --> 39:04.715
He would say... your picture
does not do you justice, Ma'am.

39:07.400 --> 39:11.713
- Another petition came for you this morning, sir.
- It's not me they should be writing to.

39:11.880 --> 39:14.714
We had no business being in Afghanistan

39:14.880 --> 39:18.556
and now our brave soldiers
have paid the price for the folly of...

39:19.640 --> 39:21.632
.. Melbourne and Palmerston.

39:22.600 --> 39:24.398
"Great game", indeed.

39:28.720 --> 39:30.871
I see you have the papers.

39:32.640 --> 39:34.916
A bad day for the country, Ma'am.

39:36.360 --> 39:38.352
What a humiliation.

39:39.240 --> 39:41.391
I am quite aware of that, Duchess.

39:42.920 --> 39:45.310
Order!

39:45.480 --> 39:47.472
Order!

39:47.640 --> 39:50.792
Can the Prime Minister explain to the House

39:50.960 --> 39:56.399
how it is that the mighty British Army
could be so humiliated at Gandamak?

39:57.840 --> 40:01.470
I suggest that the real question should be,

40:01.640 --> 40:06.795
what were the British Army
doing in Afghanistan in the first place?

40:06.960 --> 40:11.512
A question the honourable gentleman knows
can only be answered by his party.

40:11.680 --> 40:13.353
Yes.

40:13.520 --> 40:15.034
That's right! That's right!

40:15.200 --> 40:17.317
- Why were we there?
- Shame on you.

40:18.320 --> 40:19.834
Order!

40:20.000 --> 40:23.550
We will try to play this down, but the
country will know we have been defeated.

40:23.720 --> 40:26.440
By tribesmen with barely
a dozen muskets between 'em.

40:26.600 --> 40:28.751
The mighty British Army,
defeated by savages.

40:28.920 --> 40:30.639
The army needs to be reformed.

40:30.800 --> 40:33.235
It needs officers of ability, not breeding.

40:33.400 --> 40:36.438
The uniform is impractical.
My designs for the helmet would...

40:36.600 --> 40:38.671
This is no time
to quibble over helmets, Albert.

40:38.840 --> 40:41.594
We need to do something splendid.

40:43.440 --> 40:45.193
Sir Robert, I read in the order papers

40:45.360 --> 40:48.194
that HMS Trafalgar
is to be commissioned tomorrow.

40:48.360 --> 40:50.192
I have decided to attend.

40:51.000 --> 40:52.912
Are you sure that's wise, Ma'am?

40:53.080 --> 40:55.356
This is a time for the country
to lick its wounds,

40:55.520 --> 40:58.115
- not celebrate a famous victory.
- I must agree, Victoria.

40:58.280 --> 41:02.069
Now is the time to attend to your family,
not to parade yourself in public.

41:02.240 --> 41:03.720
I'm sure you agree, Albert.

41:03.880 --> 41:06.520
I do not think we should celebrate defeat.

41:08.040 --> 41:09.952
And you, Duke? What do you think?

41:10.120 --> 41:12.555
I think you're absolutely right, Ma'am.

41:12.720 --> 41:17.476
Trafalgar was a great victory
but it came after a defeat.

41:17.640 --> 41:22.999
We must remind the nation that its army
and navy are the best in the world.

41:23.840 --> 41:25.069
Thank you, Duke.

41:25.240 --> 41:27.630
Please make the arrangements.

41:27.800 --> 41:29.792
Ma'am.

41:38.960 --> 41:40.838
I will not be able to attend, Victoria.

41:41.000 --> 41:43.674
I have a meeting of the
Sanitation Commission.

41:44.760 --> 41:49.152
As you wish... but I think
the fighting spirit of this country

41:49.320 --> 41:52.154
is more important than... plumbing.

42:24.680 --> 42:26.751
Your Royal Highness.

42:26.920 --> 42:29.196
I thought you would be with the Queen.

42:29.360 --> 42:31.158
As you can see, I am not.

42:48.200 --> 42:49.600
Her expression.

42:49.760 --> 42:52.195
It's as if she knows what I am thinking.

42:55.240 --> 42:58.312
When the Queen was a little girl,
maybe five years old,

42:58.480 --> 43:00.790
she said to me...

43:00.960 --> 43:03.953
"I can see you're missing
your home, Lehzen,

43:04.120 --> 43:08.194
and sometimes you want to cry,
but I will make you happy again."

43:10.160 --> 43:12.470
She was so young and yet so wise.

43:14.720 --> 43:16.279
I had forgotten it.

43:25.680 --> 43:27.353
Her Majesty the Queen!

43:47.800 --> 43:53.194
Today... this becomes my ship.

43:55.480 --> 44:00.032
It is called Trafalgar,
after a great victory,

44:00.200 --> 44:04.513
when this country defeated a tyrant
who threatened our very existence.

44:12.720 --> 44:14.552
We have our travails now.

44:15.960 --> 44:18.794
We have suffered a blow in Kabul.

44:18.960 --> 44:22.954
Brave men have perished
in the snows of the Khyber Pass.

44:23.120 --> 44:25.316
We mourn their loss.

44:27.120 --> 44:29.396
But, as a soldier's daughter...

44:30.640 --> 44:34.316
.. I know this nation has the greatest
armed forces in the world.

44:35.040 --> 44:38.477
We will snatch victory
from the jaws of defeat.

44:38.640 --> 44:44.637
And the spirit of Trafalgar burns
as bright now as it has ever done.

44:58.960 --> 45:02.795
Nicely done, Ma'am, nicely done.

45:02.960 --> 45:06.510
You know, Peel, I think little Vicky
is doing her country proud.

45:06.680 --> 45:09.957
They know their Queen is there
when it counts.

45:44.160 --> 45:48.200
It's disgusting in here, ladies. Do you
think I can cook in a room like this?

45:48.360 --> 45:50.431
Mr Francatelli, you came back!

45:52.200 --> 45:55.557
These pots and pans are a disgrace,
don't you think?

45:57.400 --> 45:59.232
I want them scrubbed...

45:59.400 --> 46:02.438
so you can see every one
of your little pock marks in 'em.

46:17.720 --> 46:19.598
- Excuse me.
- Oh.

46:19.760 --> 46:21.353
Mrs Skerrett.

46:25.280 --> 46:27.351
Thank you.

46:29.880 --> 46:32.236
- Miss...
- Cleary, Ma'am.

46:33.200 --> 46:37.558
The Chiswick Institute sent me -
about the junior dresser's position.

47:11.760 --> 47:17.154
I expect she is dreaming of her
future husband, the King of Prussia.

47:17.920 --> 47:20.196
Well, that's just the start.

47:21.520 --> 47:23.716
If Uncle Leopold would have his way,

47:23.880 --> 47:26.839
we would have a Coburg
on every throne in Europe.

47:30.040 --> 47:32.839
I don't want her to be a pawn
in some dynastic game.

47:35.000 --> 47:37.799
I want my daughter to be free
to marry, as I did...

47:39.800 --> 47:41.837
.. for love.

48:10.000 --> 48:12.674
I'm sorry I was rude about your helmets.

48:13.920 --> 48:15.559
They really are very practical...

48:15.720 --> 48:17.598
But not very splendid.

48:20.120 --> 48:22.112
No.

48:25.280 --> 48:28.591
I just want to make things better, for now.

48:29.440 --> 48:30.999
I know you do...

48:32.200 --> 48:36.877
.. but you must remember this country
has a past as well as a future.

48:43.760 --> 48:46.070
Do you think our future might...

48:47.120 --> 48:49.271
.. might involve more of this?
