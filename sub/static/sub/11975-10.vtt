WEBVTT

00:09.133 --> 00:11.300
Look at this.
You want a necklace?

00:11.300 --> 00:14.000
Scott and I had one
extra night in Vail.

00:14.000 --> 00:19.133
I think realizing Scott can come
on our family vacations was big.

00:19.133 --> 00:21.167
What do you want to
do?

00:21.167 --> 00:23.167
Go-go to the room and
party.

00:23.167 --> 00:27.933
You guys, Rob proposed

00:27.933 --> 00:30.467
in front of her whole family at
her house last night.

00:30.467 --> 00:33.233
It happened, like,
spontaneously, so that's why you

00:33.233 --> 00:35.633
- guys weren't in the loop.
- Do you understand that

00:35.633 --> 00:38.433
that was hurtful to us that we
found out about your engagement

00:38.433 --> 00:40.633
- on social media?
- Yes, I understand.

00:40.633 --> 00:43.033
There's one more thing I have to
talk to you guys about, but I

00:43.033 --> 00:45.000
- don't want you guys to get mad.
- You're having a

00:45.000 --> 00:46.700
- baby.
- Yeah.

00:46.700 --> 00:48.833
- Congratulations.
- I know Khloe's probably

00:48.833 --> 00:50.567
- feeling...
- Congratulations.

00:50.567 --> 00:54.167
I personally don't know what the
next step for all of us are.

00:54.167 --> 01:05.900
I mean, that's up to Rob.♪ ♪

01:05.900 --> 01:09.000
What do you think
life is like with three kids?

01:09.000 --> 01:11.933
Different than two?
Or same as two?

01:11.933 --> 01:13.733
No, it's different, I
think.

01:13.733 --> 01:15.733
Why? Are you thinking about
having a third?

01:15.733 --> 01:18.533
Kanye has said it every
single day for, like, the last

01:18.533 --> 01:20.133
- week.
- Really?

01:20.133 --> 01:22.933
And I was like, "I don't
think I can carry another one."

01:22.933 --> 01:26.733
I just feel like, ugh, I'll
never be the same down there.

01:26.733 --> 01:29.567
Kanye says it, like, feels the
same.

01:29.567 --> 01:31.733
Wait, tell me.
Do you think it's different?

01:31.733 --> 01:33.533
Dude, 100% things
change.

01:33.533 --> 01:35.133
Like, it's like throwing

01:35.133 --> 01:36.833
- a hot dog through a hallway?
- No, it's not about

01:36.833 --> 01:38.333
- that.
- I heard that ought to

01:38.333 --> 01:40.000
feel.
I feel like me and

01:40.000 --> 01:42.300
Kanye don't care about that.
It's like, the fact that,

01:42.300 --> 01:46.133
like... something that big has
come in and out of there,

01:46.133 --> 01:48.533
like, things are just
different internally.

01:48.533 --> 01:50.867
There's just, like, bumps and
curves that, like, you know what

01:50.867 --> 01:52.200
- I'm saying? Like...
- Oh, my God.

01:52.200 --> 01:53.600
It's just not the
same.

01:53.600 --> 01:55.333
It's like the same
house, but the furniture's been

01:55.333 --> 01:56.967
- rearranged.
- Correct.

01:56.967 --> 01:59.067
- Huh.
- Exactly.

01:59.067 --> 02:02.300
The front door is still the
same, but inside all of your

02:02.300 --> 02:04.633
couches have been spread apart
and mixed and matched like a

02:04.633 --> 02:08.167
hurricane hit.
Yeah, that's a good analogy.

02:08.167 --> 02:11.033
my life.

02:29.833 --> 02:33.667
Oh, you dropped it.
Are you gonna dive?

02:33.667 --> 02:36.533
Go, Gabbana, go.
Go, go, dive!

02:36.533 --> 02:38.967
Dive, dive, dive!
You can do it.

02:38.967 --> 02:41.700
You can do it!
Dive!

02:41.700 --> 02:45.833
Yeah, go under.
You did it!

02:45.833 --> 02:49.867
- Good girl!
- So, have you told

02:49.867 --> 02:53.733
- anybody about Rob and Chyna?
- No. I have no one to

02:53.733 --> 02:58.400
tell, nor do I care to be, like,
the person that...

02:58.400 --> 03:00.400
- Tells?
- Yeah, and also there's

03:00.400 --> 03:03.667
so much, like, drama with them.
I don't want them to get mad if

03:03.667 --> 03:06.233
we do say something, so I'm
acting like nothing's happening.

03:06.233 --> 03:11.233
But how do you
feel?

03:11.233 --> 03:13.333
I mean, it's Rob's
life.

03:13.333 --> 03:17.833
I don't know.
How do you feel?

03:17.833 --> 03:21.167
I feel like
children are a blessing from

03:21.167 --> 03:23.400
- God.
- Okay.

03:23.400 --> 03:28.033
And that, you know,
it's God's plan and, like, I

03:28.033 --> 03:30.833
just want him to be happy,
really.

03:30.833 --> 03:33.967
My brother and I have
always had such a strong

03:33.967 --> 03:36.933
connection, and we've always
been so close.

03:36.933 --> 03:40.000
So what bothers me is not that
he's engaged, not that he's

03:40.000 --> 03:43.633
having a baby, but that Rob has
completely just disconnected

03:43.633 --> 03:46.067
from me.
He hasn't spoken to me since he

03:46.067 --> 03:49.233
told us Chyna was pregnant.
He's not including me in his new

03:49.233 --> 03:52.600
life, so how could I be happy
for someone or something that I

03:52.600 --> 03:55.167
- know nothing about?
- Hopefully it's all

03:55.167 --> 03:57.567
- for the right reasons.
- I mean, I've never

03:57.567 --> 03:59.633
really known her.
Like, I've never had a

03:59.633 --> 04:01.500
- relationship with her.
Mm-hmm.

04:01.500 --> 04:05.167
So I don't know the
type of person she is.

04:05.167 --> 04:09.700
She must be somewhat of a good
person for Rob to like her.

04:09.700 --> 04:12.800
- 'Cause Rob's funny and charming.
- Yeah.

04:12.800 --> 04:16.100
- I like this, um, fabric.
- It's called something

04:16.100 --> 04:18.733
- magical, such as terrycloth.
- I know.

04:18.733 --> 04:38.033
- I have it on my couches.
- Very exclusive.

04:38.033 --> 04:44.533
That looks so cool.
The arm looks so pretty.

04:44.533 --> 04:48.500
"VIP only."
This is so exciting.

04:48.500 --> 04:50.467
- I love the gold.
- They have one more

04:50.467 --> 04:53.167
look.
Gold leaf in my hair and gold

04:53.167 --> 04:56.367
- leaf on my hands.
- Oh, cool.

04:56.367 --> 04:59.733
So Kanye is shooting the video
for "Highlights" this weekend

04:59.733 --> 05:02.833
in Iceland.
He just really wants me there

05:02.833 --> 05:05.867
when he's shooting the video.
Every time Kanye and I have a

05:05.867 --> 05:08.233
project that each other's
working on, we definitely try to

05:08.233 --> 05:11.133
be there just to give, like,
moral support and input.

05:11.133 --> 05:13.533
We really do feed off each other
a lot, so I know it's really

05:13.533 --> 05:15.433
important to him that I come to
Iceland.

05:15.433 --> 05:17.600
- That'll be fun.
- Yeah.

05:17.600 --> 05:20.300
And I really want you to go with
me.

05:20.300 --> 05:22.833
Um... it's during
my birthday.

05:22.833 --> 05:24.333
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- I think I would

05:24.333 --> 05:25.600
- still go.
- Yeah, why not?

05:25.600 --> 05:27.567
- Make it a birthday trip.
- Yeah.

05:27.567 --> 05:29.067
Jonathan and Simon would
would come.

05:29.067 --> 05:31.500
Yeah.
I always get anxious to, like,

05:31.500 --> 05:35.067
travel and not bring the kids,
but that's my favorite song from

05:35.067 --> 05:37.600
the album.
I feel like it would be fun.

05:37.600 --> 05:41.033
I've always wanted to go to
Iceland, but I just don't know

05:41.033 --> 05:45.567
how I'm going to feel being away
from my kids on my birthday.

05:45.567 --> 05:49.667
But I want to be adventurous and
do things that are different, so

05:49.667 --> 05:53.500
I think it's fine to do this
quick trip to Iceland, and just,

05:53.500 --> 05:57.400
like, live life and have fun.
Someone was saying that the

05:57.400 --> 06:01.167
radiation on airplanes, that,
like, it's not good to bring

06:01.167 --> 06:05.167
- your kids if you don't have to.
- Nothing's good, you

06:05.167 --> 06:06.467
- know?
- No, I know.

06:06.467 --> 06:08.033
Yeah, just don't
breathe.

06:08.033 --> 06:10.067
Yeah.

06:17.567 --> 06:21.133
How much do you think
you weigh right now?

06:21.133 --> 06:24.133
- Too much.
- Like 300 pounds?

06:24.133 --> 06:27.000
No.
Two...

06:27.000 --> 06:28.867
- sixty?
- Okay.

06:28.867 --> 06:32.000
Well, I wasn't, like, that far
off.

06:32.000 --> 06:35.467
- What's your ideal weight?
-  245.

06:35.467 --> 06:37.967
Okay.
Well, you can't just sit at home

06:37.967 --> 06:41.533
and eat Twinkies and soda and
lose weight.

06:41.533 --> 06:44.733
If that was the case, I would've
been super skinny years ago.

06:44.733 --> 06:46.900
- You are skinny.
- Thanks, Lam.

06:46.900 --> 06:51.833
You're welcome.
Is Robert Arthur Kardashian

06:51.833 --> 06:53.933
- getting married?
- He says he's getting

06:53.933 --> 06:56.000
- married.
- When?

06:56.000 --> 06:59.167
I don't know when.
He hasn't told us anything.

06:59.167 --> 07:01.467
- Why not?
- Rob has disconnected

07:01.467 --> 07:05.600
himself from us-- apparently,
mainly me.

07:05.600 --> 07:09.867
He doesn't talk to me; I hear he
talks to my sisters way more.

07:09.867 --> 07:11.933
I just hope he's
focused.

07:11.933 --> 07:13.967
Marriage ain't easy, honey
child.

07:13.967 --> 07:16.300
It's not?
Your marriage wasn't easy?

07:16.300 --> 07:18.300
I've been there

07:18.300 --> 07:20.433
- before.
- Mm.

07:20.433 --> 07:22.633
- True.
- Call Rob.

07:22.633 --> 07:25.600
I mean...
he probably won't answer my

07:25.600 --> 07:28.300
phone call.
You want to try?

07:28.300 --> 07:32.067
- Yeah.
- Move your big leg.

07:32.067 --> 07:37.267
He won't answer.

07:37.267 --> 07:39.100
- Oh.
- Yo.

07:39.100 --> 07:41.600
- 'Sup, water bug?
- 'Sup, water bug?

07:41.600 --> 07:44.500
I am really surprised
that Rob answered the call,

07:44.500 --> 07:47.067
'cause even though Lamar's
calling him, it's from my phone.

07:47.067 --> 07:50.367
It does make me smile 'cause at
least I know he... is finally

07:50.367 --> 07:52.667
gonna answer one of my phone
calls.

07:52.667 --> 07:55.933
I'm just running around.
I'm just buying ice cream.

07:55.933 --> 07:57.700
I got strawberry
shortcake in the house.

07:57.700 --> 08:00.033
I'm gonna tear that  up
when I get in the house.

08:00.033 --> 08:02.067
How is that helping
your diet?

08:02.067 --> 08:04.267
It accelerates your

08:04.267 --> 08:06.033
- metabolism.
Mm-hmm.

08:06.033 --> 08:08.433
You getting married
soon, daddio?

08:08.433 --> 08:11.200
Yeah.
I don't know how soon, but first

08:11.200 --> 08:14.600
comes love, then comes marriage,
you know.

08:14.600 --> 08:16.600
When you gonna come
see me, bro?

08:16.600 --> 08:18.467
- Whenever.
- Can we go out to eat

08:18.467 --> 08:23.233
- sometime this week?
- Yeah, whenever you want.

08:23.233 --> 08:26.900
I have always loved
Lamar and Rob's relationship and

08:26.900 --> 08:29.533
bond, and I want them to hang
out, but, you know, I still want

08:29.533 --> 08:32.533
my time with Rob.
He hasn't had any one-on-one

08:32.533 --> 08:34.767
time with me.
Rob hasn't attempted to do

08:34.767 --> 08:37.800
- anything with me.
- We can go out Friday.

08:37.800 --> 08:40.333
Friday?
Okay.

08:40.333 --> 08:42.500
Is that all?
It says "poor connection."

08:42.500 --> 08:44.700
That's a sign.
Do you want to say bye?

08:44.700 --> 08:46.333
So I'm gonna see you
Friday.

08:46.333 --> 09:00.067
- All right, bro.
- It's done.

09:00.067 --> 09:04.567
- Hey, my hearty!
- Who is that?

09:04.567 --> 09:06.833
Hi, Northie.
Oh!

09:06.833 --> 09:08.867
- Hi, bud.
- Okay, you want to

09:08.867 --> 09:10.700
- pick shorts?
- P, let me have a hug

09:10.700 --> 09:12.533
first, 'cause I haven't even had
one yet.

09:12.533 --> 09:14.533
- Let's see.
- No.

09:14.533 --> 09:16.367
You want a hug?
P, you're not gonna give me a

09:16.367 --> 09:18.033
- hug, even though North is?
- Shorts or pants?

09:18.033 --> 09:19.867
Kid's not even my
daughter.

09:19.867 --> 09:21.700
That's not your
daughter.

09:21.700 --> 09:24.933
Who is?
Who is my daughter?

09:24.933 --> 09:27.367
- Me.
- Now my daughter better

09:27.367 --> 09:29.633
come over here and give me a
hug.

09:29.633 --> 09:31.633
- Come here.
- I'll meet you in the

09:31.633 --> 09:33.633
- middle.
- Okay.

09:33.633 --> 09:36.333
I'm waiting.
Paloosh.

09:36.333 --> 09:39.500
No!
Belly buster, belly buster!

09:39.500 --> 09:42.067
- Now I'm your daughter.
- Bug?

09:42.067 --> 09:43.900
- Hmm?
- What are you gonna do

09:43.900 --> 09:45.967
- for your birthday?
- Um, I think I'm

09:45.967 --> 09:48.100
going to Iceland with Kim and
Kanye.

09:48.100 --> 09:50.100
- To Iceland?
- To Iceland.

09:50.100 --> 09:52.100
- Icelandia.
- That's quite a trip,

09:52.100 --> 09:53.933
- isn't it?
- Icelandic.

09:53.933 --> 09:55.700
So why Iceland?
I don't get it.

09:55.700 --> 09:57.200
Kanye's gonna shoot a
video there.

09:57.200 --> 09:59.467
- Okay.
- And I don't know.

09:59.467 --> 10:01.633
We've just never been.
It's, like, on my bucket list.

10:01.633 --> 10:03.300
Are you taking the
kids?

10:03.300 --> 10:05.200
- No.
- But I'm sad to not

10:05.200 --> 10:07.433
- be with the kids on my birthday.
- Are you gonna be there

10:07.433 --> 10:09.433
- on your actual birthday?
- Yes.

10:09.433 --> 10:11.433
- Oh.
- Oh, cool.

10:11.433 --> 10:13.767
That's weird.
I've been with you on your

10:13.767 --> 10:15.767
- birthday for the past ten years.
- Hey, Dad!

10:15.767 --> 10:19.767
It's weird.
I know Kourtney and I aren't

10:19.767 --> 10:22.400
together, but I figured she was
gonna do something locally,

10:22.400 --> 10:25.333
and I'd be there to at least,
you know, wish her a happy

10:25.333 --> 10:27.633
birthday and give her a hug or
give her a gift.

10:27.633 --> 10:30.500
We've been together for each
other's birthdays forever, so,

10:30.500 --> 10:36.500
you know, it's just a little sad
for me to hear.

10:36.500 --> 10:38.733
So I had something I wanted to
run past you.

10:38.733 --> 10:41.300
Kourtney and I have spent every
birthday together for the past

10:41.300 --> 10:44.933
ten years.
Do I just say screw it and just,

10:44.933 --> 10:48.633
- like, fly to Iceland?
- Hmm.

10:48.633 --> 10:52.467
- Hey, Khlo.
- This is kind of

10:52.467 --> 10:55.100
awkward, just having, like,
Rob and Lamar walk into the

10:55.100 --> 11:08.200
theater like nothing has
happened.

11:08.200 --> 11:11.833
We are heading to
Iceland for Kanye's music video.

11:11.833 --> 11:15.467
Kourtney's coming, Jonathan,
Simon, Kourtney's friend Nicole.

11:15.467 --> 11:17.667
We're just gonna make it a
really fun trip.

11:17.667 --> 11:20.000
I think this will be the perfect
place to spend Kourtney's

11:20.000 --> 11:23.167
birthday, 'cause it's a place
that's totally on our bucket

11:23.167 --> 11:26.500
list that we never thought we'd
ever go to.

11:26.500 --> 11:37.667
There it is,
Reykjavik.

11:37.667 --> 11:39.933
Hello, Western people.

11:44.600 --> 11:46.600
Look how beautiful
that is.

11:46.600 --> 11:48.600
Yeah, I got to
look.

11:48.600 --> 11:55.100
Take it in.
Beautiful.

11:55.100 --> 11:56.600
- Hi.
- Hello.

11:56.600 --> 11:58.233
- Hi.
- Hi. Good morning.

11:58.233 --> 11:59.900
Guys, we're
definitely gonna need to sleep,

11:59.900 --> 12:02.033
like, a few hours.
It's 1:30 in the

12:02.033 --> 12:03.933
morning in L.A.

12:14.800 --> 12:17.000
- Kris?
- Hi.

12:17.000 --> 12:19.267
- Hi.
- Hi. Can I have a hug?

12:19.267 --> 12:21.267
I can barely see you
with all that camo on.

12:21.267 --> 12:23.267
I know.
Well, it's a disguise.

12:23.267 --> 12:25.433
- You blend right in.
- What's going on?

12:25.433 --> 12:27.467
Sure got a lot of
magazine covers in here.

12:27.467 --> 12:29.767
I know.
The kids have been busy.

12:29.767 --> 12:32.033
Evidently.
So I had something I wanted to

12:32.033 --> 12:34.033
- run past you.
- Huh.

12:34.033 --> 12:37.467
Kourtney and I have
spent every birthday together

12:37.467 --> 12:40.700
between mine and hers for the
past ten years.

12:40.700 --> 12:42.767
- Oh.
- And her birthday's

12:42.767 --> 12:45.533
coming up.
Do I just say, like, screw it

12:45.533 --> 12:50.800
and just, like, fly to Iceland
and surprise her and, like...?

12:50.800 --> 12:55.633
Hmm.
The thing that I hear her say is

12:55.633 --> 12:59.667
that she just wants you to be a
good person and a great dad, and

12:59.667 --> 13:03.700
to do it first for yourself and
then for your kids and then for

13:03.700 --> 13:05.633
- her, kind of like.
- Right. I know she says

13:05.633 --> 13:07.467
- that.
- You know what I mean?

13:07.467 --> 13:09.900
But, like, let's say
if, in a year from now, or ten

13:09.900 --> 13:14.000
years from now, we worked things
out, like, I would hated to have

13:14.000 --> 13:16.100
missed a birthday.
You know what I mean?

13:16.100 --> 13:18.200
Yeah. You know what
would be the best birthday

13:18.200 --> 13:23.133
present ever?
Just be that fun dad and that

13:23.133 --> 13:25.967
responsible dad that she's
always praying that you will

13:25.967 --> 13:28.233
- turn into magically.
- Yeah.

13:28.233 --> 13:31.300
I don't know.
I don't really know what to do.

13:31.300 --> 13:33.900
One of the things that Kourtney
and I argued about when we were

13:33.900 --> 13:38.767
together was that I never really
fought enough for her, so now

13:38.767 --> 13:40.767
I'm thinking, should I go to
Iceland?

13:40.767 --> 13:43.467
Because maybe now she would
appreciate me putting in some

13:43.467 --> 13:45.967
effort.
It's just hard sometimes.

13:45.967 --> 13:49.667
Like, you know, when you've had
all these memories, and then...

13:49.667 --> 13:51.833
they are stopping, you know, one
by one.

13:51.833 --> 13:53.733
Yeah.

14:08.567 --> 14:10.467
- Hi. Welcome.
- Hi. Thank you.

14:10.467 --> 14:12.300
Knutur Armann.
I'm the farmer.

14:12.300 --> 14:13.967
- Hi.
- Hi.

14:13.967 --> 14:15.967
We call it tomato
schnapps.

14:15.967 --> 14:18.300
Ooh, how exciting,
guys.

14:18.300 --> 14:21.600
We have the day off here
before Kanye's shoot, and I want

14:21.600 --> 14:23.900
to see what Iceland's really
known for.

14:23.900 --> 14:27.433
They have this amazing organic
tomato farm, and it is

14:27.433 --> 14:29.700
Kourtney's birthday.
She's all about all the organic

14:29.700 --> 14:32.633
stuff, so I figured we should
just check it out and see what

14:32.633 --> 14:34.633
- it's about.
- Welcome to my farm.

14:34.633 --> 14:36.633
- Thank you.
- Beautiful.

14:36.633 --> 14:39.300
Here we try to grow
what's healthy, tasty, good,

14:39.300 --> 14:41.167
- fresh tomatoes as possible.
- Wait.

14:41.167 --> 14:43.300
- Is that all bees in there?
- Yeah. The flowers--

14:43.300 --> 14:45.833
they need to be pollinate.
Otherwise, we will not have many

14:45.833 --> 14:47.667
tomatoes.
And to help us to do that, we

14:47.667 --> 14:49.633
have the bumblebees.

14:49.633 --> 14:51.667
- About 600 active bumblebees.
- Oh, my...

14:51.667 --> 14:53.500
Oh, my God, hold
on.

14:53.500 --> 14:55.133
Sorry.

14:55.133 --> 14:57.100
Are these the killer bees?

14:57.100 --> 14:58.700
No, no, no.
These are bumblebees.

14:58.700 --> 15:00.233
- They are very friendly.
- Kim used to be

15:00.233 --> 15:02.267
friends with bees when she was
little.

15:02.267 --> 15:08.400
I used to really like
bees.

15:08.400 --> 15:10.300
Cheers.

15:13.533 --> 15:16.233
Yes, guys.
This is called living.

15:16.233 --> 15:19.267
- I just put basil in your drink.
- Wait. Can you believe

15:19.267 --> 15:21.267
it's your birthday week?
Are you so excited?

15:21.267 --> 15:23.100
Mm-hmm.
- But if you think about

15:23.100 --> 15:26.633
it, for the last ten years,
like, we've all been in, like,

15:26.633 --> 15:29.633
Mexico or, like, something with
you guys.

15:29.633 --> 15:32.233
- True.
- I feel like Iceland's a

15:32.233 --> 15:35.633
- good change.
- I'm definitely

15:35.633 --> 15:39.367
happy that I came and that I'm
doing something different for my

15:39.367 --> 15:43.367
birthday, but I feel like I'm a
little bit homesick.

15:43.367 --> 15:45.933
I definitely miss my kids so
much.

15:45.933 --> 15:49.467
But I'm just gonna try to make
the most of it while I'm here.

15:49.467 --> 15:51.467
Aren't you going to the video
shoot?

15:51.467 --> 15:53.467
Yeah.
Do you want to come?

15:53.467 --> 15:55.300
- I don't know.
- How far is the shoot?

15:55.300 --> 15:57.933
It's 90 minutes, but
it's atop of a glacier.

15:57.933 --> 15:59.800
Do I have to take a
helicopter?

15:59.800 --> 16:01.467
- It's a helicopter.
- I'm not so much a

16:01.467 --> 16:03.300
- helicopter person.
- But you're gonna do

16:03.300 --> 16:05.133
- it anyway?
- Yeah, I got to do it

16:05.133 --> 16:07.367
for the shoot.
It's hard to shoot these videos.

16:07.367 --> 16:10.200
Like, I was in Scotland, took a
helicopter over.

16:10.200 --> 16:14.133
It was below the wind chill.
You know, on the side of a rock.

16:14.133 --> 16:16.133
You step two steps over, you
could die.

16:16.133 --> 16:17.800
- Kill yourself, yup.
- And I was just sitting

16:17.800 --> 16:19.433
there, I was like, "Man, people
don't give a  about

16:19.433 --> 16:21.333
videos like that anymore, and
people don't appreciate, like,

16:21.333 --> 16:23.333
all the work you put into it."
Yeah.

16:23.333 --> 16:25.167
I need to just do some
on green screen.

16:25.167 --> 16:27.867
This is a tomato ice

16:27.867 --> 16:29.700
- cream.
- Everything is made

16:29.700 --> 16:31.533
- out of tomato.
- Tomato ice cream.

16:31.533 --> 16:32.867
That's the tomato on
top.

16:32.867 --> 16:35.067
Yeah, yeah, that is
the tomato on top.

16:35.067 --> 16:37.467
Do you have cappuccino without a

16:37.467 --> 16:43.767
tomato blend?

16:43.767 --> 16:45.733
What up, man?
How you doing, son?

16:45.733 --> 16:47.367
- Can I get a photo?
- Yeah, let's take it,

16:47.367 --> 16:49.333
- yeah.
- Okay. I appreciate it.

16:49.333 --> 16:52.167
- Thank you.
- What? It smells?

16:52.167 --> 16:53.933
- Someone tooted?
- There was a toot.

16:53.933 --> 16:55.667
- It's the tomatoes.
- I don't know.

16:55.667 --> 16:57.333
- Someone tooted.
- Well, it's definitely

16:57.333 --> 16:59.200
- one of us.
- Jonathan.

16:59.200 --> 17:00.800
Just 'cause my
shirt's the color of tomato

17:00.800 --> 17:14.933
doesn't mean I  farted.

17:14.933 --> 17:18.933
- K.K. heart.
- You look pretty.

17:18.933 --> 17:21.567
Thank you.
I love your eyebrows.

17:21.567 --> 17:23.567
- They're thicker.
- Oh.

17:23.567 --> 17:26.900
Hold on.
Okay, that's fine.

17:26.900 --> 17:28.900
- What's going on with you?
- I'm a little

17:28.900 --> 17:32.500
frustrated 'cause I was with
Lam, and he was FaceTiming Rob,

17:32.500 --> 17:34.167
and they were, like, talking,
and like, "Oh, I want to see

17:34.167 --> 17:36.167
you, let's hang out."
Blah, blah, blah.

17:36.167 --> 17:40.200
Rob is making such an effort to
hang out with Lam, but yet Rob

17:40.200 --> 17:43.333
still hasn't seen me, nor will
he talk to me.

17:43.333 --> 17:45.333
And so it's a little...
Like, I'm a little annoyed by

17:45.333 --> 17:47.367
- that.
Mm-hmm.

17:47.367 --> 17:49.400
But, okay, so what do
I have to do?

17:49.400 --> 17:52.033
- You feel left out?
- No. I don't care to do

17:52.033 --> 17:54.467
what they're doing.
I just feel like I'm owed, like,

17:54.467 --> 17:56.767
a conversation ever since he's
moved out of here.

17:56.767 --> 17:59.533
I mean, it's like, okay, so you
do have time.

17:59.533 --> 18:01.467
I just wish you guys
could break the ice.

18:01.467 --> 18:03.533
- I don't see why...
- Break the ice, like we

18:03.533 --> 18:05.500
- don't know each other.
- No, well, that's

18:05.500 --> 18:07.400
how you guys are acting.
It's, like, ver-- I'm sorry,

18:07.400 --> 18:09.333
even to hear it is, like,
very strange.

18:09.333 --> 18:13.500
Mm-hmm. It's so weird.
- I don't get it.

18:13.500 --> 18:16.833
I feel like there's, like, this
one little thing that needs to

18:16.833 --> 18:19.633
- be done to fix it.
- If I'm not invited to

18:19.633 --> 18:23.500
hang out or do something, what
am I supposed to do?

18:23.500 --> 18:29.067
- What's the plan, man?
- Yeah, I don't know.

18:29.067 --> 18:30.767
Should we FaceTime
Scott?

18:30.767 --> 18:33.733
- What's going on with you guys?
- He gets so carried

18:33.733 --> 18:36.900
away and ahead of himself.
That's just not what I want

18:36.900 --> 18:41.100
- right now.
- Do you want me to go

18:41.100 --> 18:43.467
- with you at 9:00 in the morning?
- Yeah.

18:43.467 --> 18:45.600
Or I was thinking I
would come at the end of the

18:45.600 --> 18:47.833
day.
Kanye's video shoot is tomorrow,

18:47.833 --> 18:50.500
but it's also Kourtney's actual
birthday.

18:50.500 --> 19:05.733
I just feel torn, 'cause I want
to be at both places.

19:09.700 --> 19:11.600
- Who's that?
- The kids.

19:11.600 --> 19:13.967
Hi, Mommy.

19:13.967 --> 19:17.100
Hi, little angel.
Look who it is.

19:17.100 --> 19:19.533
- HI, P.
- Hi.

19:19.533 --> 19:23.167
Hi, I miss you.
P, I'm in Iceland.

19:23.167 --> 19:25.500
It's freezing here and it was
snowing.

19:25.500 --> 19:27.733
- Where's Mase?
- I'm going to the

19:27.733 --> 19:29.700
- bathroom!
- Oh.

19:29.700 --> 19:31.067
You guys, I'm

19:31.067 --> 19:34.033
getting in the car. I'm going to
call you from the car, okay?

19:34.033 --> 19:35.733
- Love you.
- Love you.

19:35.733 --> 19:37.700
Bye.
Are we ready?

19:37.700 --> 19:39.100
The car's pulling up,
I think.

19:39.100 --> 19:40.900
All right. Kim,
have fun at the fitting.

19:40.900 --> 19:44.033
Thank you.
Kanye and I are going to go to

19:44.033 --> 19:46.333
his fitting for his shoot
tomorrow, and I'm going to meet

19:46.333 --> 19:48.300
up with everyone a little bit
later.

19:48.300 --> 19:51.233
I don't want to ditch Kourt on
her birthday week, but I am here

19:51.233 --> 19:53.967
to support Kanye, so I want to
be with him.

19:53.967 --> 19:56.533
And I'm just trying to juggle it
all.

19:56.533 --> 19:58.767
I think you look better without
it.

19:58.767 --> 20:00.533
Oh, that's not the point.

20:00.533 --> 20:01.867
We're going to the
car?

20:01.867 --> 20:03.467
- We're going, yeah.
- So let's go.

20:03.467 --> 20:05.300
All right.
Bye, Kim.

20:05.300 --> 20:07.200
Ooh!

20:09.367 --> 20:23.867
We're literally blowing away.♪ ♪

20:23.867 --> 20:26.100
Do you think that
people go on romantic retreats

20:26.100 --> 20:27.567
- to Iceland?
- I mean,

20:27.567 --> 20:30.033
anywhere can be romantic.

20:30.033 --> 20:33.100
- That's pretty.
- Thank you.

20:33.100 --> 20:35.033
How about that
at the airport.

20:35.033 --> 20:36.633
- Yeah.
- Who?

20:36.633 --> 20:38.233
- Rob. Wild.
- I didn't see it.

20:38.233 --> 20:39.433
He's, like, so
normal.

20:39.433 --> 20:40.700
- Yeah.
- He's like...

20:40.700 --> 20:41.767
- Giggling.
- He's, like,

20:41.767 --> 20:43.067
- chattering with them outside...
- Stop.

20:43.067 --> 20:45.467
No, like full
interview. It's like crazy.

20:45.467 --> 20:47.133
He says, "Yeah, hello,
all right."

20:47.133 --> 20:48.967
Can you let me in on a
secret-- why would we not be

20:48.967 --> 20:50.800
happy for Chyna?
She's made... turned Rob into,

20:50.800 --> 20:52.533
- like, a new man.
- This is the only

20:52.533 --> 20:56.300
issue, I think, why everyone
cared, was because she, like,

20:56.300 --> 20:59.233
bashed Kylie and stuff like
that, when they first got

20:59.233 --> 21:00.567
- together.
- Nonstop.

21:00.567 --> 21:03.333
But I feel like
that was her, like,

21:03.333 --> 21:06.000
relationship, and they have a
kid together, and, like, who

21:06.000 --> 21:07.967
- wouldn't feel that way?
- I think it would...

21:07.967 --> 21:09.333
She's really funny.
Like...

21:09.333 --> 21:10.567
- Chyna?
- Yeah, she's a

21:10.567 --> 21:11.667
- laugher.
- I remember her with

21:11.667 --> 21:12.833
- Kim, she was so...
- She used to be,

21:12.833 --> 21:15.100

that we're gonna see some kind

31:49.200 --> 31:51.567
- of colored sky tonight?
- People fly to

31:51.567 --> 31:54.667
Iceland just to see the
northern lights.

31:54.667 --> 31:57.567
- Whoa.
- What's the point of

31:57.567 --> 31:59.367
- this?
- Um, do you want to go

31:59.367 --> 32:07.233
out with Rob to dinner?
And Blac Chyna?

32:11.400 --> 32:14.700
Kanye's video shoot is
in this really crazy, remote

32:14.700 --> 32:16.833
place.
It's like an hour and a half

32:16.833 --> 32:20.267
drive, then a 30 minute
helicopter ride.

32:20.267 --> 32:22.833
I'm just nervous that I'm not
gonna make it to Kanye's shoot

32:22.833 --> 32:27.133
in time.
When we get to the glacier,

32:27.133 --> 32:31.467
Kanye is already done shooting
and I'm, like, heartbroken.

32:31.467 --> 32:34.633
He's being nice, and kissed me,
and it's all good, but, like, I

32:34.633 --> 32:36.800
just know he's more, probably,
disappointed in me.

32:36.800 --> 32:38.400
Which heli are we
getting in?

32:38.400 --> 32:40.300
That one over there?

32:56.133 --> 32:58.367
Hello, my Khloe...

32:58.367 --> 33:01.000
- Hello, Lord.
- That's some ensemble.

33:01.000 --> 33:04.767
- What I'm wearing?
- For the Blu Jam.

33:04.767 --> 33:06.967
- What are you getting?
- I don't know, I'm

33:06.967 --> 33:08.633
- freaking out.
- It's way too many

33:08.633 --> 33:12.900
options.
What is-- how is this-- I can't

33:12.900 --> 33:14.967
- say this word.
- "Chilaquiles."

33:14.967 --> 33:16.733
Okay, I'm gonna get
that then.

33:16.733 --> 33:18.500
I'll have that, but no
sour cream.

33:18.500 --> 33:20.400
Thanks so much.
I just talked to Kourt, I sent

33:20.400 --> 33:23.300
- her flowers for her birthday.
- In Iceland?

33:23.300 --> 33:24.433
- That's nice.
- Yeah.

33:24.433 --> 33:26.233
Are you sad that
you're not with Kourt on her

33:26.233 --> 33:28.133
- birthday?
- Yeah, obviously.

33:28.133 --> 33:31.300
And, I mean...
I was, like, gonna go there and

33:31.300 --> 33:33.467
- just, like, try to surprise her.
- Oh, that's right, what

33:33.467 --> 33:35.533
- happened to that?
- But then...

33:35.533 --> 33:40.000
You know how she is, I would get
there and she'd be like...

33:40.000 --> 33:41.833
"What are you doing here
exactly?"

33:41.833 --> 33:44.067
Well, she's not the
person that's even gonna scream

33:44.067 --> 33:45.933
- for joy anyway.
- Ever.

33:45.933 --> 33:47.833
- Even when we were together.
- When we bought her a

33:47.833 --> 33:51.633
puppy at three years old, my mom
said she goes, "What's next?"

33:51.633 --> 33:56.833
See, that's just Kourt.
Scott is normally so consumed

33:56.833 --> 33:59.833
about his own feelings and his
own thoughts, and finally I

33:59.833 --> 34:02.767
think he's being really aware of
Kourtney's feelings, so I think

34:02.767 --> 34:05.433
it's, like, a real sign of
maturity that Scott just sent

34:05.433 --> 34:09.133
her flowers and was respectful
of her space, and chose to stay

34:09.133 --> 34:11.733
home.
Did you hear that Rob and Lamar

34:11.733 --> 34:14.400
are hanging out again?
When have you spoken to Rob

34:14.400 --> 34:16.833
- last?
- Last, I wrote him and

34:16.833 --> 34:19.467
I said, "I love you," you know,
and "Be good."

34:19.467 --> 34:22.033
Caitlyn texted me
yesterday and said all she does

34:22.033 --> 34:25.400
is try to reach out the Rob, and
Rob doesn't respond.

34:25.400 --> 34:29.733
It's like, well, I don't talk to
Rob either.

34:29.733 --> 34:31.800
That must be hard for
you though because, I mean, he

34:31.800 --> 34:35.400
went from living at your house,
never leaving the house for

34:35.400 --> 34:38.000
years, and now all of a sudden,
like...

34:38.000 --> 34:57.167
weird.♪ ♪

34:57.167 --> 35:00.967

My heart's still
pounding from the helicopter.

35:10.200 --> 35:12.300
- Why he mad?
- He's annoyed that I

35:12.300 --> 35:19.033
didn't see him perform.
I feel so bad, I feel so guilty.

35:19.033 --> 35:21.733
The one thing I was out here to
do, I missed.

35:21.733 --> 35:23.667
- So today was my fault.
- For what?

35:23.667 --> 35:25.567
- What happened?
- I think he thinks, like,

35:25.567 --> 35:27.233
"Kourt and her friends are
coming, and they'll just hang

35:27.233 --> 35:28.933
out.
Like, we might see them, but,

35:28.933 --> 35:30.667

But now it's like, "Oh, babe, I

35:30.667 --> 35:32.833
might see you."

- the right thing to do is.
- I'm not going from "A"

35:51.367 --> 35:54.033
to "Z."
I need to talk to Rob first.

private conversation and just

things out so we could just move

I squeezed my butt in.

43:03.033 --> 43:05.667
What... Are you...
My legs don't go in here.

43:05.667 --> 43:07.633
There's a bigger
one, look.

43:07.633 --> 43:10.533
God...
Oh, this is like, oh...

43:10.533 --> 43:12.533
Yeah!
Living the dream.

43:12.533 --> 43:14.467
American Airlines, all

43:14.467 --> 43:18.167
the way up front.
Living the dream.

43:18.167 --> 43:19.967
Keeping Up with
the Kardashians...

43:19.967 --> 43:23.133
I have to do Fergie's
video about M.I.L.F.$.

43:23.133 --> 43:24.733
What's going on with
the stalker?

43:24.733 --> 43:26.400
He's out of the
psychiatric ward.

43:26.400 --> 43:28.467
He didn't just get
released, he escaped.

43:28.467 --> 43:30.433
Kylie needs a
wake-up call.

43:30.433 --> 43:33.233
- What's on my car?
- I did an interview for

43:33.233 --> 43:36.633
GQ.
I've had it with people

43:36.633 --> 43:39.767
blatantly treating my husband a
certain way and making him look

43:39.767 --> 43:42.500
a certain way and I'm gonna say
how I feel.

43:42.500 --> 43:44.633
He really did want to do the
right thing.

43:44.633 --> 43:47.700
