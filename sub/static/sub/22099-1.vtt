To save humanity
from damnation

14:38.253 --> 14:41.213
by bringing the love of God
to these poor benighted people.

14:41.297 --> 14:43.173
We're here because
the majority of the Cylon

felt that the slaughter of
mankind had been a mistake.

14:49.973 --> 14:51.682
And it's been a fun ride
so far.

14:51.766 --> 14:54.226
But I want to clarify
our objectives.

14:54.310 --> 14:55.644
If we're bringing
the word of God,

14:55.728 --> 14:56.937
then it follows

14:57.021 --> 14:59.773
that we should employ any
means necessary to do so.

14:59.857 --> 15:01.149
Any means.
Yes.

15:01.234 --> 15:04.278
Fear is a key article
of faith, as I understand it.

15:04.362 --> 15:07.239
So perhaps it's time to
instill a little more fear

15:07.323 --> 15:09.908
into the people's
hearts and minds.

15:10.368 --> 15:13.453

I have cooperated...

beginning, it might have worked.

think of him as a traitor

15:37.979 --> 15:39.354

cheer his death.

brass is gonna be at the graduation,

21:38.381 --> 21:40.465
even President Baltar.

21:41.467 --> 21:42.759
Gaius Baltar?

21:42.843 --> 21:43.843
Yes, sir.

21:43.928 --> 21:45.303
I think we can get
a shot at him, too.

21:45.388 --> 21:47.764
The problem is, it's gonna be
tough avoiding human casualties.

21:47.848 --> 21:50.141
Don't avoid them!
Send a message.

21:50.226 --> 21:52.477
You work with the Cylons,
you're a target.

21:52.561 --> 21:55.730
No boundaries for the Cylons,
there's no boundaries for us!

21:55.815 --> 22:00.694
Anything we can do to nail that son of
a bitch, Gaius Baltar, is worth doing.

22:06.283 --> 22:07.283
(GROANING)

22:07.618 --> 22:09.661
Where are we
on the wireless?

22:09.745 --> 22:13.039
Nowhere. Every day we try
and contact the Raptor,

22:13.124 --> 22:16.251
and every day the Cylons
jam the transmission.

22:16.335 --> 22:18.253
I've asked the inside source
to tell us

22:18.337 --> 22:20.547
which of the Cylon jamming
frequencies are the weakest,

22:20.631 --> 22:21.923
but so far I've got nothing.

22:22.008 --> 22:26.302
You guys are dreaming.
There's no Raptor there, okay?

22:26.429 --> 22:29.931
There hasn't been one for
the past four months, either.

22:30.016 --> 22:33.268
Galactica's not coming back.
They're not.

22:33.978 --> 22:36.771
Accept it. You watch
your frakking mouth!

22:37.189 --> 22:40.442
There's a Raptor out there every
day, listening for our wireless call.

22:40.526 --> 22:43.987
It's out there because that was
the plan if anything happened.

22:44.071 --> 22:48.324
And it's out there because the old man
isn't just gonna leave us to the Cylons!

22:48.409 --> 22:51.411
The old man left me
to the Cylons, Colonel.

22:51.495 --> 22:54.539
And if it wasn't for my wife
being a royal pain in the ass

22:54.623 --> 22:55.915
and refusing to let it go,

22:56.000 --> 22:58.043
I would be dead
a year now.

23:08.137 --> 23:09.763
Any word on Kara?

23:13.059 --> 23:15.310
Nothing in four months.

24:05.820 --> 24:08.029
I'm trying to
help you, Kara.

24:08.781 --> 24:11.783
I only want you to see
the truth of your life,

24:11.867 --> 24:14.577
the reason why you suffered
and you struggled for so long.

24:14.662 --> 24:16.287
That's why God
sent me to you.

24:16.372 --> 24:19.040
That's why God wants us
to be together.

24:20.584 --> 24:22.210
You're right.

24:24.755 --> 24:26.172
You're right.

And I hear you. I do.

24:28.717 --> 24:29.717
Okay.

24:31.428 --> 24:33.054
So, thank you.

24:39.395 --> 24:42.188
Thank you
for putting up with me.

24:44.316 --> 24:45.316
I'm so sorry.

24:45.401 --> 24:47.652
Put it down, Kara.

24:52.199 --> 24:53.908
Just put it down.

25:03.878 --> 25:05.003
You're not a man.

25:05.087 --> 25:07.672
I'm willing to wait.
You just need more time.

25:07.756 --> 25:11.718
I don't need more frakking
time. It's never gonna happen.

25:11.802 --> 25:14.470
Of course it's gonna happen.
You're gonna hold me in your arms.

25:14.555 --> 25:18.141
You're gonna embrace me. You're
gonna tell me that you love me.

25:18.767 --> 25:20.310
I've seen it.

25:21.979 --> 25:23.730
You're insane.

25:23.814 --> 25:26.774

is to know madness.

25:31.989 --> 25:33.907

refueling before they recover the drones

one more time.

Yes, sir. 16 times now, sir.

are they doing over there?

This is the Commander.
Get the Admiral on the line.

29:03.659 --> 29:05.493
Admiral, considering
how long our pilots

29:05.577 --> 29:07.537
have been in the air, I
suggest we recall the birds

29:07.621 --> 29:09.122
and scrub
the training exercise.

29:09.206 --> 29:10.873
If we can't do this
in a training scenario,

29:10.958 --> 29:12.959
how the hell are we supposed
to pull this off

29:13.043 --> 29:15.086
with Cylon raiders
on our asses?

29:15.337 --> 29:17.922
Huh? Tell me! What the
frak do you want from me?

29:18.006 --> 29:20.425

do any of this crap at half strength!

all across the board!

your birds back home.

to follow.

29:46.368 --> 29:48.453

is frakking insane.

29:48.537 --> 29:49.912
We've got two ships
at half strength.

29:49.997 --> 29:52.165
We've got crews that haven't
seen action in a year and a half,

29:52.249 --> 29:56.419
and you're acting like the only problem
is they're not working hard enough?

29:56.503 --> 30:00.381
Have you taken a look at
yourself in the mirror lately?

30:00.466 --> 30:04.552
You're weak, soft,
mentally and physically.

30:04.636 --> 30:05.803
This isn't about me.

30:05.888 --> 30:09.265
You've had four months
to get your act together.

30:09.349 --> 30:11.559
And so far all you've
been able to frakking do

30:11.643 --> 30:14.312
is to complain and whine
about how hard it is.

30:14.396 --> 30:16.564
Well, guess what?

30:16.648 --> 30:19.650
It's gonna get a lot harder.
Do you understand me?

Now, I want you to turn around
and get your fat ass out of here.

30:23.071 --> 30:26.115

can't back out once you've started.

30:58.565 --> 31:00.942
I'm not backing out.

31:01.276 --> 31:03.361
It's wrong, Colonel.
You know that, don't you?

31:03.445 --> 31:04.737
He's a soldier, Chief.

31:04.821 --> 31:07.657
It's not the first time we've sent
a soldier on a one-way mission.

to take out Gaius Baltar.

31:14.915 --> 31:18.084
It may be the only one, and
we're sure as frak gonna take it.

just don't do, Colonel,

It's a hard thing to say,

32:26.069 --> 32:29.697
but it seems like I don't
know who my son is anymore.

32:29.781 --> 32:32.992
The same goes
for the crew, the ship.

32:34.202 --> 32:38.289

Except maybe for you.

32:41.043 --> 32:42.293
I wish I could
come back a year

32:42.377 --> 32:44.712
and tell that Admiral Adama
about this conversation.

32:44.838 --> 32:46.631
A year's a long time.

32:50.719 --> 32:53.429
Can I ask you something
very personal?

32:57.434 --> 33:01.729
Do you feel guilty about leaving
the people behind on New Caprica?

33:02.981 --> 33:04.732
I don't do guilt.

33:08.904 --> 33:12.406
You know, a year ago,

33:13.575 --> 33:17.411
when you put me in this cell,
I was at a crossroads.

33:20.707 --> 33:24.126
I sat in here for weeks,
just consumed with rage

33:24.211 --> 33:27.046
at all the things
that had happened to me.

33:30.967 --> 33:34.553
And at some point I realized
it was all just guilt.

33:35.889 --> 33:39.100
I was angry at myself for
the choices I had made.

33:40.602 --> 33:44.438
Betraying my people,
losing my baby.

33:49.778 --> 33:52.196
So I had a choice.

33:53.031 --> 33:56.283
I could either move forward
or stay in the past.

33:56.785 --> 34:01.622
But the only way to move
forward was to forgive myself.

34:02.624 --> 34:04.625
You know, I don't think we can survive,

34:04.710 --> 34:10.673
I don't think the Fleet or Galactica
or the people on New Caprica can survive

34:12.300 --> 34:18.055
unless the man at the top
finds a way to forgive himself.

to bust my balls.

Oh, you agree,
is that it?

I'm not talking
about the weight.

35:13.904 --> 35:17.490
You've lost your edge,
your confidence.

35:19.993 --> 35:21.702
You lost your war, Lee.

And the truth is, you're
a soldier who needs a war.

35:26.917 --> 35:29.001
And you don't want to hear it
because you've got it in your head

35:29.085 --> 35:30.961
that your father's
the soldier,

35:31.087 --> 35:33.631
and you sure don't want
to be like him.

35:33.715 --> 35:35.758
But you are like him.

than you know.

That's one of the reasons
I married you.

35:50.941 --> 35:51.941
(WHIMPERS)

36:11.711 --> 36:13.295
(BEEPING)

36:13.380 --> 36:15.756
Okay, it's working, I think.

36:16.383 --> 36:18.467
Is it working
or isn't it?

36:18.969 --> 36:20.886
They keep jamming us.

36:21.012 --> 36:23.639
So much for our source
on the inside.

36:36.069 --> 36:39.989
Ten minutes left. And lots of
nothing on the wireless as usual.

36:40.991 --> 36:43.033
Keep an eye out for Raiders.

36:43.118 --> 36:47.580
The last listening bird almost
got popped by a pair yesterday.

36:49.040 --> 36:50.916
I've almost got it.

36:51.001 --> 36:52.459
(BEEPING)

36:52.544 --> 36:55.087
Oh, frak.
Turn that thing down.

36:56.214 --> 36:59.258
It's working.
It's working.

37:03.930 --> 37:06.724
Time's up. Spin up the
FTL, and get ready to go.

37:06.808 --> 37:09.476
Hold on. I'm picking something up.

37:10.854 --> 37:12.062
It's a Colonial transmission.

37:12.147 --> 37:15.816
It's a low power signal, but
the recognition codes match.

37:15.901 --> 37:18.777
Oh, yeah, we've got
a link to the ground.

37:19.279 --> 37:21.697
Okay, send the coded response,
spin up the drive,

37:21.781 --> 37:23.699
and let's get the hell
back to Galactica.

37:24.576 --> 37:26.869
We've got a signal.

37:26.953 --> 37:28.579
The Raptor just
made contact with us.

37:28.663 --> 37:30.623
TIGH: What's it say?

37:30.874 --> 37:34.251
"Will make contact this
frequency every twelve hours.

37:34.544 --> 37:39.506
"Prepare sitrep for command authority.
Have hope. We're coming for you. "

37:40.508 --> 37:44.136
RACETRACK: We made contact! I say
again, we made contact with the ground.

37:44.512 --> 37:47.348
Colonel Tigh has formed an
insurgent group against the Cylons,

37:47.432 --> 37:48.807
and now they're
ready and waiting

37:48.892 --> 37:52.519
for instructions on how to
coordinate the rescue effort.

37:55.357 --> 37:59.610
It's gonna be okay.
It's really gonna be okay.

38:19.422 --> 38:22.383
These are the surveillance
pictures taken by the insurgents.

38:22.467 --> 38:26.178
I think we can match names
to about 50 of these photos,

38:26.262 --> 38:29.807
but our best guess puts the
total police force at around 200.

38:29.891 --> 38:31.433
Two hundred.

38:32.852 --> 38:34.478
I wouldn't have believed
there'd be 20 people

38:34.562 --> 38:36.522
who would turn
against their own kind.

38:36.606 --> 38:39.316
I want those names. I
want the rest of the names.

38:39.401 --> 38:43.487
That's tough. The Cylons are afraid
the population will go after any human

38:43.571 --> 38:44.905
who joins
the New Caprica Police.

38:44.990 --> 38:46.865
As well they should.

39:03.049 --> 39:04.049
(STUTTERING)

39:06.469 --> 39:09.179
I know I haven't lived
a model life.

39:10.682 --> 39:12.933
I made a lot of mistakes.

39:16.438 --> 39:19.273
I'm gonna need
your protection today.

39:22.777 --> 39:23.736
(KNOCK ON DOOR)

39:23.820 --> 39:24.862
GAETA: Mr. President?

39:24.946 --> 39:26.447
CAPRICA SIX:
Good morning, Gaeta.

39:26.948 --> 39:29.575
It's time for
the graduation ceremony.

39:33.121 --> 39:37.791
Oh, yes, the ceremony.

39:38.960 --> 39:42.212
About the ceremony.
There's been a change of plan.

39:42.464 --> 39:44.089
I won't be going.

39:45.925 --> 39:47.551
Security concern.

39:54.142 --> 39:55.642
Don't look so worried.

39:56.227 --> 39:58.062
There'll be
other graduations.

39:59.314 --> 40:03.984
Right. Okay. I'll just
let the staff know.

40:12.410 --> 40:14.078
I think we should
call off the strike.

40:14.162 --> 40:16.955
There's no reason to go forward
if the Galactica's gonna come back.

40:17.040 --> 40:20.667
What, pass up a golden
opportunity to kill Gaius Baltar?

40:21.336 --> 40:23.170
Other than that, Colonel,
I fail to see the point.

40:23.254 --> 40:25.089
Think with your head, Chief,
not with your heart.

40:25.173 --> 40:27.674
The only way they stand a chance
of getting us off this rock

40:27.759 --> 40:30.135
is if the Cylons are
too distracted battling

40:30.220 --> 40:32.930
a full-blown uprising
when they get here.

40:34.390 --> 40:38.435
All right. If your source on the inside
says Baltar's not gonna be there, abort.

40:38.520 --> 40:40.729
Otherwise,
stick with the plan.

41:11.094 --> 41:14.638
MAN ON SPEAKER: ... hormonal
imbalances or neurological disorders.

41:14.722 --> 41:17.307
But many have found relief at
the New Caprica medical center

41:17.392 --> 41:19.560
where a crack team of human
and Cylon physicians...

42:27.837 --> 42:29.171
(CROWD CHATTERING)

42:37.639 --> 42:39.264
Hey, Duck.

42:40.975 --> 42:42.267
OFFICER: Fall in!

43:00.495 --> 43:04.331
Good morning and welcome
to all graduates.

43:05.375 --> 43:07.876
You are the hope.

43:07.961 --> 43:12.673
You are the dream of a new
tomorrow for humans and Cylon alike.

43:12.757 --> 43:18.220
And I salute you for the risks that you
have taken for just showing up today.

43:19.305 --> 43:22.266
Today you begin
a new career

43:22.392 --> 43:25.352
and a new life as
provisional police officers.

43:25.979 --> 43:27.271
And looking out
across this room,

43:27.355 --> 43:32.651
I see the significance of this
new path is not lost on you.

43:37.156 --> 43:40.200
Congratulations.
It's good to have you with us.

43:41.411 --> 43:44.663
Congratulations, Sergeant.
A dangerous mission.

43:51.796 --> 43:55.257
Congratulations, Captain.
It's great to have you with us.

43:55.341 --> 43:57.384
I'll see you soon, Nora.
