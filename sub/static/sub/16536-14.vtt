00:01.168 --> 00:02.711
<i>Previously on Designated Survivor...</i>

00:02.836 --> 00:05.631
Vice President Peter MacLeish
was shot and killed

00:05.756 --> 00:07.258
by his wife, Beth MacLeish.

00:07.383 --> 00:10.636
She then turned the gun upon herself
and committed suicide.

00:10.761 --> 00:14.306
You are a target.
I want our kids to have a normal life.

00:14.432 --> 00:16.475
I spoke with Mike about Camp David.

00:16.600 --> 00:18.436
He says it's more secure.

00:18.561 --> 00:20.771
President Moss wants to get back
into politics.

00:20.896 --> 00:23.149
He just wants to share
the benefit of his experience.

00:23.274 --> 00:25.776
Inviting him into the White House
could lift the nation,

00:25.901 --> 00:28.195
- project a sense of solidarity.
- I'll set it up.

00:28.320 --> 00:29.363
Maybe you need some personal time.

00:29.488 --> 00:32.241
- Take maybe a week.
- Yes, sir.

00:32.366 --> 00:34.326
I would like you
to be my acting chief of staff.

00:34.452 --> 00:35.661
I won't let you down.

00:35.786 --> 00:36.954
Aaron?

00:37.079 --> 00:38.205
Aaron Shore's made contact with someone.

00:38.330 --> 00:39.623
That's Charles Langdon.

00:42.418 --> 00:44.962
What the hell's going on?
I thought you were dead, Charlie.

00:45.087 --> 00:46.672
Just follow me.

00:55.973 --> 00:58.517
They just ducked
into St. Angelo's on 10th.

01:00.102 --> 01:02.938
Copy. Cover the north entrance.
We're a minute out.

01:07.276 --> 01:09.445
Please rise for the blessing.

01:11.572 --> 01:12.782
Let us pray.

01:16.577 --> 01:18.496
- We go now.
<i>- Copy that.</i>

01:19.330 --> 01:21.207
Charlie,
you got to tell me what's going on.

01:21.332 --> 01:23.000
Just listen.
I've only got a minute.

01:23.125 --> 01:25.669
I need you to do something for me.
My life depends on it.

01:34.011 --> 01:35.888
Go. Go.

01:41.685 --> 01:43.354
- Shore!
- Agent Wells?

01:43.896 --> 01:45.981
- Where's Langdon?
- H-He took off. I didn't even --

01:46.107 --> 01:47.900
- Which door?
- He walked out that way.

01:48.025 --> 01:49.902
Stay there! Hendricks!

01:50.027 --> 01:52.071
- Which door isn't covered?
- East side.

02:06.836 --> 02:08.670
Thank you, Ava.

02:08.795 --> 02:11.257
Mr. President, it's nice
to see you without the cane.

02:11.382 --> 02:13.509
- You must be feeling better.
- I am. Thank you.

02:13.634 --> 02:16.428
We're compiling a short list
of VP candidates for you to look over,

02:16.554 --> 02:17.972
as well as more potential
cabinet appointees.

02:18.097 --> 02:19.890
Unfortunately,
it's still slim pickings, sir.

02:20.015 --> 02:22.393
Most people are very apprehensive
about joining the new administration.

02:22.518 --> 02:24.895
- There's just too much uncertainty.
- Well, hopefully, former President Moss

02:25.020 --> 02:26.939
can help with that.
He promised a list of names

02:27.064 --> 02:28.858
and to throw his weight around
until they said yes.

02:28.983 --> 02:31.485
- I'm seeing him tomorrow, right?
- Yes. Your meeting is set for midday.

02:31.610 --> 02:34.947
I've also set up an informal dinner
at the Residence with the First Lady.

02:35.072 --> 02:36.740
Unless, of course, she's not available.

02:36.866 --> 02:39.034
No, no, no.
She'll be there.

02:39.160 --> 02:40.953
I take it you're a fan of President Moss?

02:41.078 --> 02:44.081
I handed out yard signs
during his first campaign, actually--

02:44.206 --> 02:45.791
Excuse me.

02:54.175 --> 02:56.886
So, how long have you
and Langdon been in contact?

02:57.011 --> 02:59.138
We haven't been in contact.

02:59.263 --> 03:02.641
I told you I thought he was dead.
He just walked up to me on the street.

03:02.766 --> 03:05.519
- And yet, you went with him.
- What was I gonna do?

03:06.061 --> 03:08.314
<i>I need to know word-for-word
what he said.</i>

03:08.439 --> 03:09.773
Don't leave anything out.

03:09.899 --> 03:11.358
Okay, but he didn't say much.

03:11.483 --> 03:14.987
He-He was extremely paranoid...
just constantly looking over his shoulder

03:15.112 --> 03:17.239
like he was being hunted or something.

03:18.741 --> 03:20.701
He said his life depended on it.

03:22.870 --> 03:24.246
Langdon wants a deal?

03:24.371 --> 03:26.957
Yes, sir.
Immunity in exchange for information.

03:27.082 --> 03:29.001
And a new life in witness protection.

03:29.126 --> 03:30.878
That's not gonna happen.

03:31.545 --> 03:34.298
The only thing Langdon
has left to bargain for is his life.

03:34.423 --> 03:36.342
What kind of information
do you think he has?

03:36.467 --> 03:39.845
Sir, we don't know yet, but he's our only
known connection to the conspiracy.

03:39.970 --> 03:41.680
Information from him
could be invaluable.

03:41.805 --> 03:43.349
Or not... I mean, for all we know,

03:43.474 --> 03:44.975
he could still be working
with the conspirators.

03:45.100 --> 03:47.228
Langdon contacted me
several times after the bombing.

03:47.353 --> 03:49.396
He's the one that put me
onto MacLeish. Without him...

03:50.564 --> 03:51.774
I'd probably be dead.

03:51.899 --> 03:55.903
Mr. President, I've spent my entire career
tracking down stone-cold criminals

03:56.028 --> 03:58.364
who'd make you swear
they were as pure as driven snow.

03:58.489 --> 03:59.573
We need more information.

03:59.698 --> 04:02.159
And in a perfect world, we would
have that. We don't have time.

04:02.284 --> 04:06.580
Shore was given 24 hours to respond.
If we don't use it, Langdon's in the wind.

04:06.705 --> 04:08.207
This could be a giant setup.

04:12.127 --> 04:13.796
You said he's running scared.

04:16.923 --> 04:18.300
Bring him in.

04:31.647 --> 04:33.816
- Morning.
- Morning. What is that?

04:33.941 --> 04:36.610
This is a bulletproof vest.

04:36.735 --> 04:39.238
I know what it is. Why do you have it?

04:39.363 --> 04:40.656
It's really just ceremonial,

04:40.781 --> 04:44.743
but, uh, each press secretary passes
this on down to the next press secretary,

04:44.868 --> 04:48.497
and I figured, since you're now acting
chief of staff, maybe a loan was in order.

04:52.001 --> 04:53.043
Emily Rhodes.

04:54.086 --> 04:56.547
- I'm on my way.
- You want me to hang this up somewhere?

04:56.672 --> 04:58.757
- I'm good.
- What, you don't want it?

04:58.882 --> 05:00.175
Thanks, though.

05:00.843 --> 05:01.844
Fine.

05:15.357 --> 05:17.109
Good morning, Mr. President.

05:17.234 --> 05:20.612
This situation in Naruba...
what do you know about it?

05:20.738 --> 05:22.781
A guerilla warlord broke a cease-fire
with the government.

05:22.906 --> 05:26.285
His name's Atsu Kalame.
He's got a militia force 10,000 strong.

05:26.410 --> 05:30.372
He's known to utilize child soldiers,
mass amputations, and human trafficking

05:30.497 --> 05:32.708
as part of his terror campaign.

05:32.833 --> 05:35.169
I served near there in the Peace Corps,

05:35.294 --> 05:36.295
25...

05:36.420 --> 05:39.798
...more than 25 years ago.

05:40.674 --> 05:43.344
They were some of the kindest people
I've ever known.

05:44.011 --> 05:47.056
The brief said families are racing
to the borders, trying to escape.

05:47.931 --> 05:49.892
I can't even imagine.

05:51.352 --> 05:53.937
Reach out to State.
We need to do something.

05:54.063 --> 05:55.606
Yes, sir.

06:41.110 --> 06:42.611
Mr. Langdon.

06:48.700 --> 06:50.285
Where do you want me to start?

06:50.619 --> 06:52.204
How about the beginning?

06:52.329 --> 06:57.376
Okay. The beginning would be Claudine.
Uh... Claudine Poyet.

06:57.501 --> 07:00.462
We met at the Meridian Ball
four years ago.

07:01.463 --> 07:05.259
I was coming off a nasty divorce
at the time. I thought I was in love.

07:05.384 --> 07:07.386
<i>Clearly, she had other things in mind.</i>

07:07.511 --> 07:09.471
When I found out what was going on...

07:11.932 --> 07:15.727
You've got to believe me that when
I figured it out, I tried to stop it.

07:15.853 --> 07:18.897
I mean, those were my friends that died,
that was my president that died,

07:19.022 --> 07:21.024
and I wish I had died with them!

07:24.945 --> 07:26.572
Okay.

07:27.030 --> 07:28.574
At first, it was just little things.

07:28.699 --> 07:31.785
She...
She worked for a big contracting firm.

07:31.910 --> 07:32.995
At least, she <i>said</i> she did.

07:33.120 --> 07:35.706
And so she asked me
to help her get some intel

07:35.831 --> 07:39.710
on some government highway contract.
It was that sort of thing for a while.

07:41.378 --> 07:45.215
And then she asked to see the threat
assessment on the Capitol renovation.

07:48.260 --> 07:49.678
Room 105.

07:49.803 --> 07:51.930
And that didn't make you suspicious?

07:52.764 --> 07:54.600
- That's treason, Langdon.
- No. No!

07:54.725 --> 07:57.728
Who could imagine that they
would've used that information

07:57.853 --> 07:59.146
in that way at the time?

07:59.271 --> 08:01.398
The only reason
I haven't put a bullet in my head

08:01.523 --> 08:03.734
is the thought that maybe I could help...

08:04.151 --> 08:05.527
...make this right.

08:06.904 --> 08:08.572
Why else do you think I'm here?

08:11.825 --> 08:13.368
Claudine Poyet...

08:14.828 --> 08:16.830
How do I know she really exists?

08:18.790 --> 08:20.209
I have a picture.

08:20.334 --> 08:21.543
I have a picture of her.

08:21.668 --> 08:22.878
She hated having her picture taken,

08:23.003 --> 08:26.006
<i>but one morning,
she was, uh, sleeping,</i>

08:26.131 --> 08:27.758
<i>and...</i>

08:27.883 --> 08:29.218
I took this.

08:45.484 --> 08:46.693
That's her.

08:49.196 --> 08:50.489
That's her.

08:58.872 --> 09:00.958
General Contreras.
Thank you for joining.

09:01.083 --> 09:02.751
What is the situation on the ground?

09:02.876 --> 09:05.462
We've got satellite photos
less than three hours old, sir.

09:05.587 --> 09:07.214
They put Kalame and his rebel forces

09:07.339 --> 09:09.841
approximately two days out
from the capital city of Soji,

09:09.967 --> 09:13.136
- with nothing in between to stop them.
- I'll reach out to the U.N. Ambassador.

09:13.262 --> 09:14.721
Maybe he'll have better luck than I did

09:14.846 --> 09:17.307
convincing the Security Council
to vote on a resolution.

09:17.432 --> 09:19.142
Why is the U.N. dragging their feet?

09:19.268 --> 09:23.897
Russia has been protesting possible
U.N. involvement with Ukraine.

09:24.022 --> 09:26.400
They're likely to veto
<i>all</i> peacekeeping moves.

09:27.067 --> 09:30.237
This has all the markings
of a potential genocide.

09:30.362 --> 09:31.196
Yes, sir.

09:31.321 --> 09:32.739
Well, that's not acceptable to me.

09:32.864 --> 09:35.200
- Are you proposing a military response?
- Maybe.

09:35.325 --> 09:38.537
I want all my options on the table -
military or otherwise - within the hour.

09:38.662 --> 09:40.038
That'll be all.

09:41.707 --> 09:43.375
Sir, President Moss is arriving now.

09:43.500 --> 09:44.876
Okay.

09:49.548 --> 09:50.424
Morning.

09:50.549 --> 09:51.508
Good morning.

09:51.633 --> 09:52.509
Good morning.

09:53.385 --> 09:54.386
How are you, gentlemen?

09:54.511 --> 09:56.888
- Mr. President. Welcome back.
- Thank you, dear.

09:57.014 --> 09:59.516
- Mr. President, it's an honor.
- Nice to see you.

10:00.517 --> 10:02.936
- Welcome back, Mr. President.
- Henry. How are the kids?

10:03.061 --> 10:04.771
Sara must be, what... 53 now?

10:04.896 --> 10:06.607
Close. 22, sir.

10:06.732 --> 10:08.525
Blink of an eye, Henry. Am I right?

10:08.650 --> 10:10.068
You are indeed, Mr. President.

10:15.866 --> 10:17.242
Mr. President.

10:18.869 --> 10:20.537
President Moss.

10:21.163 --> 10:23.707
Mr. President.
It's an honor to have you here, sir.

10:23.832 --> 10:25.417
Thank you, Ava.

10:30.047 --> 10:32.382
Ah. View never gets old, does it?

10:32.507 --> 10:35.385
I don't know.
I-I haven't been here that long yet.

10:36.094 --> 10:37.262
Indeed.

10:37.387 --> 10:40.265
I can't tell you how special it is
to finally meet you face-to-face.

10:40.390 --> 10:44.227
And I want you to know that I am open to
hearing any advice that you have to offer.

10:44.353 --> 10:45.771
Well...

10:45.896 --> 10:48.815
first piece of advice
my predecessor gave me was,

10:48.940 --> 10:51.151
"Don't listen to the advice
of your predecessor."

10:52.736 --> 10:56.156
Well, I'll take that under advisement.

10:56.281 --> 10:59.284
All joking aside, I look up to you, sir,

10:59.409 --> 11:01.912
and I would love to hear
how you think I'm doing so far.

11:03.914 --> 11:05.582
No, you wouldn't.

11:07.751 --> 11:08.835
I-I'm sorry?

11:08.960 --> 11:10.295
Total honesty?

11:12.255 --> 11:13.548
Yes, always.

11:14.925 --> 11:17.427
You were handed an impossible job, son,

11:18.595 --> 11:20.305
a political non-entity,

11:20.430 --> 11:23.475
never ran for office,
never served in uniform,

11:23.600 --> 11:27.354
suddenly thrust into the most
powerful job in the world

11:27.479 --> 11:30.774
during an unprecedented crisis.

11:31.441 --> 11:33.318
Hell, you shouldn't have
expected much of yourself.

11:33.443 --> 11:35.445
And the people shouldn't have, either.

11:36.321 --> 11:37.322
Well...

11:37.989 --> 11:39.658
I asked for honesty.

11:39.783 --> 11:43.120
Well, don't get me wrong.
You've made some great strides.

11:43.245 --> 11:45.205
I give you a passing grade, professor.

11:45.330 --> 11:48.542
But, uh, the handling of Majid Nassar,

11:48.667 --> 11:50.877
the way you let the Russians
play you like a fiddle

11:51.002 --> 11:52.671
when it came to that damn track coach,

11:52.796 --> 11:54.798
not to mention our late vice president

11:54.923 --> 11:58.009
ordering the FBI to kill the man
who tried to kill <i>you.</i>

11:59.344 --> 12:01.847
Company scuttlebutt is that
that was no coincidence.

12:01.972 --> 12:05.392
- That's an ongoing investigation, sir.
- No, no. I get it.

12:05.517 --> 12:07.394
Believe me, I do.

12:07.519 --> 12:10.480
Running this country
is the hardest job there is.

12:10.856 --> 12:13.400
Problem is, with everything
that's been flying at you,

12:13.525 --> 12:15.277
you're not actually running it.

12:16.945 --> 12:20.157
You're reacting, not leading.

12:22.117 --> 12:23.660
But it's like I said...

12:23.785 --> 12:25.495
you were simply outgunned.

12:26.288 --> 12:28.165
So don't be too hard on yourself.

12:32.294 --> 12:34.045
I won't, Mr. President.

12:34.171 --> 12:35.839
I'll let you take care of that.

12:37.841 --> 12:41.344
I'm told you had some names for me,
cabinet positions.

12:41.470 --> 12:42.721
I sure as hell do.

12:45.056 --> 12:47.517
Now, these are some damn fine people,

12:48.059 --> 12:50.687
and I think they'll be able
to help you out.

12:50.812 --> 12:52.063
Thank you.

12:55.817 --> 12:58.528
You, uh, got any Wild Turkey lying about?

12:58.653 --> 13:00.572
I used to keep some in that drawer.

13:01.239 --> 13:02.532
No, I'm sorry.

13:02.657 --> 13:04.409
Each his own.

13:04.534 --> 13:06.328
Mind if I call the kitchen?

13:07.037 --> 13:08.830
Sure. Go ahead.

13:12.584 --> 13:13.835
Yeah.

13:14.503 --> 13:15.921
How are you?

13:24.846 --> 13:27.057
Uh, okay, this is scary. What is it?

13:27.182 --> 13:30.811
This is the threat assessment file
you had recalled on June 23, 2015.

13:30.936 --> 13:33.772
What the hell are you talking about?
Who even generated this file?

13:33.897 --> 13:36.775
You had this file electronically retrieved
from a list of top government officials

13:36.900 --> 13:38.485
before they had a chance to study it.

13:38.610 --> 13:40.278
W-Well, okay, that would explain it.

13:40.403 --> 13:42.489
If I did it electronically,
I never would've seen this.

13:42.614 --> 13:44.908
- But you remember withdrawing it?
- Well, o-of course not!

13:45.033 --> 13:46.701
Langdon asked me to do
a number of things,

13:46.827 --> 13:49.579
and believe me, if I would've seen
something like this, I would remember it.

13:49.704 --> 13:51.289
Is this why Emily was snooping
through my phone records?

13:51.414 --> 13:53.792
- You tell me.
- Well, you were tailing Langdon.

13:53.917 --> 13:56.002
Why didn't you just pick him up
and ask him yourself?

13:56.127 --> 13:57.963
We weren't tailing Langdon.

14:03.802 --> 14:05.971
I mean, do I need an attorney?

14:06.471 --> 14:08.181
You're free to walk anytime.

14:08.306 --> 14:11.351
Right now, you're just a friendly witness
in an investigation, nothing more.

14:11.476 --> 14:12.978
Yeah, but you were following me.

14:13.103 --> 14:15.689
Mr. Shore, the Bureau's investigating
the greatest crime ever committed

14:15.814 --> 14:18.024
against the government
of the United States.

14:18.149 --> 14:20.026
If you can contribute
to our understanding,

14:20.151 --> 14:21.945
it would be a great service.

14:22.821 --> 14:24.614
So let me ask you again.

14:24.990 --> 14:27.158
To the best of your memory,

14:28.618 --> 14:30.787
what can you tell us about this file?

14:42.507 --> 14:44.009
- Hey.
- Hi.

14:44.134 --> 14:46.219
- Welcome back.
- How are you?

14:46.344 --> 14:48.013
- I'm all right.
- You okay?

14:48.138 --> 14:49.431
Hey...

14:49.931 --> 14:52.183
- I really missed you.
- Come on.

14:52.309 --> 14:53.852
I was only gone for a day.

14:53.977 --> 14:56.646
I know. It just... feels longer than that.

14:56.771 --> 14:58.023
- How are the kids?
- Good.

14:58.148 --> 15:01.026
Penny has discovered horseback riding.

15:01.151 --> 15:02.193
Wow.

15:02.319 --> 15:03.695
That was fast.

15:03.820 --> 15:07.157
And she's already decided
that she's gonna ask <i>you</i>

15:07.282 --> 15:09.034
to buy her a pony for her birthday.

15:09.159 --> 15:12.245
Well, she can always ask. How's Leo?

15:12.370 --> 15:15.373
He's really good. This has really
made him grow up, you know?

15:15.498 --> 15:17.375
I'm proud of him.

15:17.500 --> 15:20.045
He understands
that this is temporary, right?

15:20.170 --> 15:23.214
I mean, they both know that this is just
until everything calms down?

15:23.340 --> 15:24.716
Yeah, they know.

15:25.675 --> 15:27.177
Okay, good.

15:28.178 --> 15:30.430
- How is your mother?
- She sends her love.

15:30.555 --> 15:33.350
Uh-huh. She still wish I was a doctor?

15:34.184 --> 15:37.729
You got to let that go. You're never
gonna impress her. She's Russian.

15:38.897 --> 15:41.858
So, how was Cornelius Moss?

15:42.317 --> 15:44.694
Uh, that went a little differently
than I expected.

15:44.819 --> 15:45.695
How so?

15:45.820 --> 15:48.698
I thought he'd be a little more
sympathetic to my situation.

15:48.823 --> 15:50.241
Hmm.

15:50.367 --> 15:52.410
Well, we'll just have
to charm him at dinner tonight.

15:52.535 --> 15:54.496
Come in.

15:55.163 --> 15:56.915
Sorry, sir. It's time to go.

15:57.040 --> 15:58.249
I'll be right there.

16:00.377 --> 16:01.586
Hey.

16:14.057 --> 16:15.684
Sit down, Charlie.

16:21.398 --> 16:23.775
You're responsible for the deaths
of over 1,000 people,

16:23.900 --> 16:26.778
- the leaders of this country.
- I had no idea what was going to happen.

16:26.903 --> 16:29.739
How could I know that the entire
government was going to be taken out?

16:29.864 --> 16:30.657
I'm not a monster.

16:30.782 --> 16:32.492
You had no idea?!

16:32.617 --> 16:35.120
You and Peter MacLeish were the only two
to survive the bombing!

16:35.245 --> 16:37.080
How do you explain that?

16:37.205 --> 16:39.124
Because I was never there.

16:39.457 --> 16:41.126
I swear. I've told them everything.

16:41.251 --> 16:42.460
Tell <i>me.</i>

16:44.629 --> 16:46.965
On the day of the State of the Union,

16:47.090 --> 16:49.718
I got a phone call from a woman
I'd come to know...

16:51.761 --> 16:53.805
...who had blackmail information on me.

16:53.930 --> 16:56.307
She said she had one last job
for me to do.

16:56.433 --> 16:57.892
What was it?

17:00.061 --> 17:02.605
She wanted me to name you
Designated Survivor.

17:11.573 --> 17:14.367
Why did she want me
named as the Designated Survivor?

17:14.492 --> 17:16.661
When I refused to make the call,
she wouldn't tell me.

17:16.786 --> 17:17.619
Not good enough.

17:17.746 --> 17:19.039
I am telling you the truth.

17:19.164 --> 17:20.665
If you didn't make the call, who did?

17:20.790 --> 17:23.376
I don't know, but it must have been
somebody with enough clearance

17:23.501 --> 17:25.670
- to make that move.
- This is a waste of time.

17:25.795 --> 17:27.839
Sir. Please hear him out.

17:35.680 --> 17:37.682
She said if I refused,
I was a dead man...

17:43.521 --> 17:44.814
Yes?

17:44.939 --> 17:47.150
<i>...and that they had eyes everywhere.</i>

17:47.484 --> 17:50.361
<i>And then she told me the color
of the tie I was wearing.</i>

17:50.487 --> 17:53.907
I was in my office in the most
secure building on the planet,

17:54.032 --> 17:56.326
and she knows what color my tie is.

17:57.202 --> 17:58.828
So I hung up.

17:59.704 --> 18:01.247
I didn't care
about the blackmail anymore.

18:01.372 --> 18:04.626
I knew I just had to tell somebody
what I knew before they got to me.

18:05.001 --> 18:08.046
<i>Clearly, the White House wasn't safe
anymore, so I got the hell out of there.</i>

18:08.171 --> 18:10.882
I got to my car, and I... I just...

18:11.007 --> 18:14.177
started to drive.
I didn't know who to trust.

18:14.302 --> 18:16.429
But then I realized it had to be the FBI.

18:16.554 --> 18:18.556
I had to get to the director himself,

18:18.681 --> 18:20.225
so I went straight

18:20.350 --> 18:22.060
<i>for Alexandria.</i>

18:25.063 --> 18:26.731
And I almost made it...

18:30.318 --> 18:32.695
<i>...but I lost control of my car.</i>

18:35.031 --> 18:37.575
Yeah. They'd hacked it somehow.

19:05.061 --> 19:08.481
I was thrown clear of the car,
and I was knocked unconscious.

19:15.071 --> 19:17.240
I made my way up to the street.

19:28.710 --> 19:30.795
And that's when I saw
the orange glow on the horizon

19:30.920 --> 19:32.714
where the Capitol used to be...

19:33.089 --> 19:35.258
And the f-flames and the...

19:42.765 --> 19:44.601
And I knew I failed.

19:44.934 --> 19:47.437
<i>So, yeah, I ran.</i>

19:49.606 --> 19:51.816
And I've been running ever since.

19:55.403 --> 19:56.821
Why should I believe any of this?

19:56.946 --> 19:59.699
Sir, we checked the surveillance footage
from the State of the Union.

19:59.824 --> 20:01.492
There's no record of him being there.

20:01.618 --> 20:04.787
A dive team checked the river.
They found the car.

20:09.834 --> 20:11.794
Give me the room for a minute, please.

20:14.464 --> 20:16.007
Mike, it's all right.

20:29.354 --> 20:31.981
You should know,
as far as I'm concerned,

20:32.106 --> 20:34.484
even if you didn't do the planning,
you're complicit.

20:35.693 --> 20:39.030
You want to make a deal for your life
with me, I expect more.

20:39.155 --> 20:41.241
I've told you everything I know.

20:41.366 --> 20:43.159
Last chance.

20:43.993 --> 20:46.871
Who wanted me as
the Designated Survivor and why?

20:46.996 --> 20:48.957
I don't know, Tom.

20:49.958 --> 20:53.253
Mr. President, I'm sorry,
but I don't know who.

20:53.378 --> 20:56.172
As to why, I wondered that myself.

20:56.839 --> 20:59.092
You're not gonna like this,
but the best I can figure is

20:59.217 --> 21:02.011
that out of all our cabinet members...

21:04.389 --> 21:06.808
...you were the least qualified
to be president.

21:08.351 --> 21:11.562
So, I don't know what the goal
of this conspiracy is.

21:11.688 --> 21:13.773
Is it a regime change?
Maybe it's just anarchy.

21:13.898 --> 21:16.025
Whatever their philosophy...

21:17.527 --> 21:21.030
they probably felt you were
the least likely to present an obstacle.

21:26.035 --> 21:28.329
Get me a one-pager on Africom
and let the room know

21:28.454 --> 21:30.707
that the White House is closely
monitoring the situation in Naruba.

21:30.832 --> 21:33.376
The president is taking this
very seriously.

21:34.836 --> 21:37.005
- Uh, Seth, you got a sec?
- Barely. What's up?

21:37.880 --> 21:39.799
I got a friend that told me
a strange story.

21:39.924 --> 21:42.719
- What kind of friend?
- Uh, the kind with security clearance.

21:43.845 --> 21:45.138
Okay.

21:45.263 --> 21:49.058
She's an analyst at this government
office park out in Alexandria.

21:49.600 --> 21:53.187
She says Aaron Shore was escorted
into the facility by FBI agents.

21:54.689 --> 21:55.898
Your friend's yanking your chain.

21:56.024 --> 21:58.067
He's on leave... personal time.

21:58.401 --> 22:00.653
- Oh, yeah? What's that about?
- I just told you.

22:00.778 --> 22:01.821
Thanks for stopping by.

22:04.073 --> 22:06.868
I find out otherwise, Seth,
this is gonna be a story.

22:07.452 --> 22:09.954
- And I'm gonna say you denied it.
- Knock yourself out.

22:11.873 --> 22:14.917
Despite my urgings
and those of the U.N. ambassador,

22:15.043 --> 22:19.130
Russia vetoed the Security Council vote
to send peacekeepers back to Naruba.

22:19.255 --> 22:20.465
What are our options?

22:20.590 --> 22:24.010
Mr. President, Naruba's one of
the poorest countries on the planet.

22:24.135 --> 22:26.763
Friendly governments in the region
lack the interest to take this on.

22:26.888 --> 22:28.389
Where does that leave us?

22:28.973 --> 22:31.351
Best option, we fly in
Reaper hunter-killer UAVs

22:31.476 --> 22:35.438
from Ethiopia and Djibouti to take out
Kalame's rebel forces and his convoy.

22:35.563 --> 22:37.315
Those missiles would stop
the advance, sir.

22:37.440 --> 22:39.150
We could expect heavy rebel casualties.

22:39.275 --> 22:41.527
How much time till the UAVs
are above their target?

22:41.652 --> 22:42.904
Six hours.

22:43.279 --> 22:45.323
How long till the rebel forces
are in the capital?

22:45.448 --> 22:46.908
A day, maybe less.

22:50.078 --> 22:51.788
If you want to keep
your options open, sir,

22:51.913 --> 22:53.998
I suggest we get those UAVs
off the ground now.

22:55.166 --> 22:57.293
I agree. Let's do it.

23:06.135 --> 23:07.136
Mr. Shore?

23:08.471 --> 23:09.931
You're free to go.

23:10.973 --> 23:12.183
Good.

23:12.308 --> 23:14.644
My office is asking where I am.

23:15.103 --> 23:17.021
They say a reporter's been
sniffing around.

23:17.146 --> 23:19.482
For the record, Langdon cleared you
of any involvement

23:19.607 --> 23:20.900
in the threat assessment file.

23:21.025 --> 23:24.028
Yeah, well, I could have told you that
if somebody would have asked me,

23:24.153 --> 23:25.822
instead of treating me
like some kind of spy.

23:25.947 --> 23:28.199
It's not personal. It's just protocol.

23:28.324 --> 23:30.034
Right. It just feels that way.

23:30.159 --> 23:32.370
I mean, a whole lot of things
make sense to me today

23:32.495 --> 23:33.830
that didn't make sense to me yesterday.

23:33.955 --> 23:36.165
My President, my closest friend
in the White House,

23:36.290 --> 23:38.501
both think I'm capable of treason.

23:39.877 --> 23:42.338
These are dangerous times, Mr. Shore.

23:44.841 --> 23:46.968
But thank you for your cooperation.

23:50.179 --> 23:51.556
No, no, no.

23:51.681 --> 23:53.391
Don't tell me
you've never had the sliders.

23:53.516 --> 23:56.060
I didn't even know
that they were a thing.

23:56.185 --> 23:58.187
Oh! Gerald, have Tony rustle up

23:58.312 --> 24:00.898
some of those wagyu sliders
with aioli, would you?

24:01.023 --> 24:03.568
I mean...
That is not necessary.

24:03.693 --> 24:06.571
Oh, necessary's got nothing to do
with it, my dear.

24:06.696 --> 24:08.239
Right away, sir.

24:08.364 --> 24:09.699
A lot of grief in this job.

24:09.824 --> 24:12.410
You got to take the gravy
wherever you can.

24:12.535 --> 24:14.579
Sir, I was looking at your list,

24:14.704 --> 24:17.582
and I was wondering
about Brett Ambrose for Interior.

24:17.707 --> 24:18.791
Mm-hmm. What about him?

24:18.916 --> 24:21.294
Well, he's been inconsistent
on climate change,

24:21.419 --> 24:24.922
and recently, he opposed a rule
to reduce methane emissions

24:25.047 --> 24:27.216
from oil drilling on public lands, so...

24:29.927 --> 24:32.430
You know, you remind me
so much of my wife, Elaine,

24:32.555 --> 24:34.223
it is downright eerie.

24:36.058 --> 24:36.934
Thank you.

24:38.728 --> 24:41.731
Ambrose is a crusty old bird, no doubt.

24:41.856 --> 24:44.984
But he understands business,
and he wants to make the United States

24:45.109 --> 24:48.070
truly energy-independent,
and that takes compromise.

24:48.196 --> 24:51.449
Hell, that's what the job is all about.

24:51.574 --> 24:54.410
Except... when it comes to the sliders.

24:56.787 --> 24:57.747
Gerald.

25:00.958 --> 25:02.460
Aaron got brought in by the FBI?

25:02.585 --> 25:05.296
Supposedly. I think it's crap. No story.

25:05.421 --> 25:06.464
Oh, for sure.

25:06.589 --> 25:09.175
I, uh, I texted him, though,
just so he's not caught off guard.

25:09.300 --> 25:10.468
Have you heard back?

25:11.052 --> 25:11.844
Not yet.

25:11.969 --> 25:14.138
I mean, did you ever imagine

25:14.263 --> 25:17.099
that we would be dealing
with the FBI and assassinations?

25:17.225 --> 25:18.309
And all of this?

25:18.434 --> 25:20.144
Not in a million years.

25:26.317 --> 25:27.777
Emily Rhodes.

25:30.112 --> 25:31.280
Thank you.

25:31.405 --> 25:32.156
Should I know?

25:32.281 --> 25:34.617
- Not yet.
- All right.

25:41.582 --> 25:43.292
Greatest show on Earth.

25:46.629 --> 25:50.132
Democracy... the grand experiment.

25:53.135 --> 25:54.637
Let me guess.

25:55.429 --> 25:58.516
Russia vetoed the Security Council vote
on Naruba.

25:58.641 --> 26:00.059
Yes.

26:00.184 --> 26:03.020
And I'm sure the Joint Chiefs
have already emphasized

26:03.145 --> 26:05.481
that Naruba is strategically worthless.

26:05.982 --> 26:07.692
People are so damn poor in that country

26:07.817 --> 26:10.236
that it doesn't even register
on economic reports.

26:10.361 --> 26:11.654
They did.

26:12.154 --> 26:14.490
So it all comes down to people.

26:15.866 --> 26:17.326
Human lives.

26:18.494 --> 26:21.205
"The eternal struggle
between two principles -

26:21.330 --> 26:24.208
right and wrong -
throughout the world."

26:24.333 --> 26:25.876
Abraham Lincoln.

26:27.545 --> 26:30.047
Imagine the courage he must have had,

26:30.172 --> 26:32.675
standing up
for the basic rights of equality,

26:33.134 --> 26:36.345
knowing he was gonna send
brothers fighting brothers.

26:39.181 --> 26:41.767
I hear you went to, uh,
visit the SEAL team

26:41.892 --> 26:44.520
before they deployed
on the Nassar mission.

26:45.187 --> 26:46.564
Yeah.

26:46.689 --> 26:49.900
It's a noble gesture,
but it does come at a cost,

26:50.026 --> 26:52.862
putting faces to the lives of the men
you send to die.

26:55.323 --> 26:57.867
We lost a commander, Max Clarkson.

26:59.827 --> 27:04.540
Not a day goes by that I don't think
about him or his family.

27:05.374 --> 27:07.376
Commander-in-Chief.

27:07.793 --> 27:09.295
It's not just a title.

27:10.212 --> 27:12.173
It is a responsibility.

27:14.008 --> 27:16.218
An awful responsibility.

27:16.802 --> 27:20.765
You were in no way prepared for it,
but you've taken it on.

27:20.890 --> 27:22.516
Bravely, I might add.

27:23.851 --> 27:25.603
Thank you.

27:25.728 --> 27:30.983
And now you have the power
to decide who lives... and who dies.

27:33.736 --> 27:35.738
It's the loneliest job in the world.

27:41.911 --> 27:43.287
- Mr. President.
- What is it?

27:43.412 --> 27:45.581
Sir, there's been a complication
in Naruba.

27:46.749 --> 27:49.126
<i>We just got intel
that 15 American humanitarian workers</i>

27:49.251 --> 27:51.587
<i>have been taken hostage
by Kalame's militia.</i>

27:53.255 --> 27:56.759
Apparently, he's holding them in several
different vehicles in his convoy.

27:57.259 --> 27:58.928
We don't know which ones.

27:59.261 --> 28:00.805
If you continue with this drone strike,

28:00.930 --> 28:02.640
you won't just be killing Kalame
and his men.

28:02.765 --> 28:04.600
We'll be killing our own.

28:05.101 --> 28:06.268
Come on. Let's go.

28:12.608 --> 28:14.068
Keep your seats.

28:14.193 --> 28:15.486
What the hell happened?

28:15.611 --> 28:17.655
How could we not know
that we had American citizens

28:17.780 --> 28:18.989
working as volunteers in the country?

28:19.115 --> 28:20.574
They were AMCIT, sir.

28:20.700 --> 28:22.993
American citizens who never
registered with an embassy.

28:23.119 --> 28:24.662
We had no way of knowing, Mr. President.

28:24.787 --> 28:26.997
Do we know where they are?
If they've been hurt?

28:27.123 --> 28:29.291
No, only that they're being kept
among Kalame's convoy

28:29.417 --> 28:31.293
so we can't target him or his men.

28:31.419 --> 28:35.631
Same strategy Hezbollah used
when they hijacked TWA 847.

28:36.215 --> 28:39.176
Took all the passengers off the plane,
spread them all around Beirut,

28:39.301 --> 28:40.970
making a counterattack impossible.

28:41.095 --> 28:44.640
- How long till the UAVs are over Naruba?
- Less than an hour, sir.

28:48.144 --> 28:50.646
Tom, about Kalame...

28:51.063 --> 28:52.440
I haven't decided yet.

28:52.565 --> 28:54.859
Well, you need to, and fast.

28:54.984 --> 28:56.819
Those volunteers have guns
to their heads.

28:56.944 --> 28:59.196
If we don't attack those rebel forces,

28:59.321 --> 29:03.451
100,000 innocent civilians in the capital
will have guns to their head, too.

29:04.285 --> 29:07.538
I don't know how to justify
15 lives over 100,000.

29:07.663 --> 29:10.040
It's not just any 15 lives, Mr. President.

29:10.166 --> 29:13.669
It's 15 American lives, your citizens.

29:14.003 --> 29:15.880
You have a responsibility to them first.

29:16.005 --> 29:18.466
At the expense of everyone else?

29:18.591 --> 29:19.675
Absolutely.

29:19.800 --> 29:22.052
This isn't about bravery or nobility.

29:22.178 --> 29:24.513
This was a failure of intelligence.

29:24.847 --> 29:27.516
Now Kalame's got you
backed into a corner.

29:28.809 --> 29:31.687
No, what you have to do is act swiftly

29:32.021 --> 29:36.275
to secure the safety
and the release of our own.

29:39.862 --> 29:42.698
Then you can decide
what you want to do with that criminal.

29:46.494 --> 29:48.078
Hey, man. You back?

29:48.204 --> 29:50.039
No, no, it's just a quick hit.

29:50.164 --> 29:53.292
Oh, how you been? You haven't, uh...
You haven't returned my texts in a while.

29:53.667 --> 29:56.253
Well, it's, uh... it's complicated.

29:56.378 --> 29:58.506
You weren't really with the FBI,
were you?

29:59.507 --> 30:01.926
Look, uh, Seth, I'm tired.

30:02.051 --> 30:03.427
No, no, no, it's fine. Come on.

30:03.552 --> 30:05.930
I mean, I know a non-answer
when I hear one.

30:06.055 --> 30:08.432
If I felt you needed
to know something, I would tell you.

30:08.557 --> 30:10.768
Yeah, hey, look, nobody talks to me
around here anymore.

30:10.893 --> 30:12.770
It makes your job
a whole lot easier, doesn't it?

30:16.398 --> 30:17.858
How's Emily doing?

30:18.400 --> 30:20.736
- Personally?
- No, no... on the job.

30:21.237 --> 30:22.905
Oh. Uh...

30:23.864 --> 30:26.283
Just... Just great.
I mean, you know Emily, right?

30:26.408 --> 30:27.785
She... She'll get the job done.

30:27.910 --> 30:29.787
Not the same way you do,
but, yeah, she's good.

30:29.912 --> 30:31.080
Good.

30:31.872 --> 30:32.915
Good.

30:34.750 --> 30:35.918
Here.

30:36.585 --> 30:37.545
What's this?

30:37.670 --> 30:39.463
Read it. It could use
a bit of your magic.

30:39.588 --> 30:40.923
Sure.

30:42.675 --> 30:44.343
I know you're right.

30:44.927 --> 30:49.473
I-I don't know how to potentially
sacrifice 100,000 people to save 15.

30:49.598 --> 30:51.183
I-I don't know how to do that.

30:51.934 --> 30:55.729
Well, you know, there is
a diplomatic option to get them out.

30:57.106 --> 30:58.482
You buy them.

30:58.607 --> 31:01.235
We don't negotiate with terrorists.
I agree with that policy.

31:01.360 --> 31:03.737
Well, there are other cards to play.

31:04.780 --> 31:09.326
You see, right now, Zimbabwe is sitting
on $7 million of Kalame's cash.

31:09.451 --> 31:12.288
Treasury put sanctions on them
for smuggling.

31:12.955 --> 31:15.791
That money is not
going anywhere right now.

31:15.916 --> 31:18.002
So if we lift their sanctions

31:18.127 --> 31:21.005
in exchange for them
releasing Kalame's cash to him...

31:21.130 --> 31:22.339
Say we get our people back.

31:22.464 --> 31:25.801
What stops me from turning around and
blowing him off the face of the planet?

31:25.926 --> 31:27.636
Because you give him your word.

31:28.804 --> 31:30.639
The world knows
that you're a square dealer,

31:30.764 --> 31:32.433
and now's the time to play that card.

31:37.396 --> 31:39.899
- I hate this.
- I hate it, too.

31:40.399 --> 31:42.943
But that's the world
you're living in, Mr. President.

31:43.068 --> 31:44.320
Sometimes you have to decide

31:44.445 --> 31:46.989
between a bad choice
and no choice at all.

31:48.157 --> 31:50.993
<i>If</i> I were to do this...

31:51.118 --> 31:52.494
how would it play out?

31:52.620 --> 31:57.708
Through a man named Austin Silwamba,
a mid-level diplomat in Zimbabwe.

31:57.833 --> 32:00.377
He's a CIA asset
that I've used in the past.

32:00.502 --> 32:03.547
You authorize him to broker a deal
allowing our people

32:03.672 --> 32:07.176
to be taken to safe passage,
to an extraction point.

32:07.676 --> 32:09.178
Then you chopper them out.

32:12.348 --> 32:13.807
Want me to make the call?

32:21.982 --> 32:23.108
Yes.

32:33.953 --> 32:34.912
Mr. President?

32:35.037 --> 32:36.205
Ava. Come in.

32:37.665 --> 32:39.333
Austin Silwamba has just landed.

32:39.458 --> 32:40.834
Okay, good. Thank you.

32:40.960 --> 32:42.586
Aaron Shore is outside, sir.

32:42.711 --> 32:45.381
Oh. Please, send him in.

32:46.215 --> 32:49.677
- Sir, if this is a bad time--
- No, no, no. Aaron, please. Please sit.

32:52.388 --> 32:55.683
I am sorry about everything
that you've had to go through lately.

32:55.808 --> 32:57.768
But I am so glad to have you back.

32:57.893 --> 33:00.187
I appreciate that, sir, but...

33:00.312 --> 33:01.730
I'm not coming back.

33:04.066 --> 33:06.610
You're angry. I understand.

33:06.735 --> 33:08.696
Uh... I would be, too.

33:08.821 --> 33:11.115
But I need you to know
that I had the Secret Service

33:11.240 --> 33:13.867
and the FBI investigating you
to clear your name.

33:13.993 --> 33:16.078
And Langdon's testimony did that.

33:16.203 --> 33:17.538
Aaron, please.

33:18.539 --> 33:20.541
Come back and help me govern.

33:21.083 --> 33:24.128
Sir, I'm sure Emily will do
an excellent job,

33:24.253 --> 33:25.921
but right now, I-I...

33:26.046 --> 33:28.132
I-I couldn't be as effective.

33:28.257 --> 33:31.218
- Not anymore.
- I don't understand. Why?

33:31.343 --> 33:34.722
Rumor mills are buzzing
about my taking leave.

33:35.514 --> 33:38.726
Word's hit the street
I was interrogated by the FBI.

33:39.268 --> 33:42.646
Now, politics is perception.
We both know that.

33:42.771 --> 33:44.815
My reputation's been damaged.

33:44.940 --> 33:48.110
Aaron, perceptions can be changed.

33:48.235 --> 33:50.320
I'll make a statement. I'll clear the air.

33:53.365 --> 33:55.075
I won't accept your resignation.

33:56.535 --> 33:58.912
I'm afraid you have no choice, sir.

33:59.038 --> 34:02.291
Seth is distributing my statement
to the press as we speak.

34:04.460 --> 34:05.753
Without talking to me.

34:05.878 --> 34:07.671
I mean no disrespect.

34:07.796 --> 34:10.674
But it is my primary job to protect you,

34:10.799 --> 34:13.342
even from your most generous instincts.

34:13.469 --> 34:17.931
Sir, right now, I'd be a liability
to your administration.

34:20.309 --> 34:24.063
The last thing you need is any hint
of scandal from your chief of staff.

34:31.320 --> 34:34.656
Serving you has been
the greatest honor of my life.

34:41.580 --> 34:42.831
Please, sir.

34:49.505 --> 34:51.465
There isn't anything I can say?

34:52.341 --> 34:54.009
No, sir.

34:59.098 --> 35:00.933
Aaron, the honor's been mine.

35:03.685 --> 35:05.062
I let you down and...

35:07.022 --> 35:08.190
I'm sorry.

35:08.315 --> 35:10.609
No, that's fine. I was just leaving.

35:11.527 --> 35:12.861
Sir.

35:15.656 --> 35:17.199
Mr. President...

35:20.160 --> 35:21.078
Sir?

35:21.203 --> 35:23.205
Yes. I'm sorry.

35:23.539 --> 35:25.499
Silwamba's negotiated with Kalame.

35:26.542 --> 35:27.835
Did we get our people back?

35:27.960 --> 35:29.253
Not yet, sir.

35:29.378 --> 35:31.922
Helicopters are on the way
to the extraction point.

35:32.047 --> 35:33.549
There's a live feed in command ops.

35:34.716 --> 35:36.009
Let's go.

35:43.475 --> 35:46.979
Sir, our people are in those trucks
on the Soji Daka Road.

35:47.855 --> 35:49.356
Where are the Black Hawks?

35:49.481 --> 35:51.567
They're putting down now.
You can track it here.

36:19.845 --> 36:23.599
Sir, all 15 volunteers are outbound.
They're free, sir.

36:31.440 --> 36:34.735
General Contreras,
are the UAVs still above Soji?

36:34.860 --> 36:37.321
We're in the process
of recalling them now, sir.

36:37.446 --> 36:38.822
Hold on for a second.

36:38.947 --> 36:39.865
Sir?

36:41.533 --> 36:43.118
You're gonna probably think
this is ridiculous,

36:43.243 --> 36:45.662
but by trade, I was an urban planner.

36:45.787 --> 36:48.123
The deal I made with Kalame
was to not attack his forces.

36:48.248 --> 36:50.459
I didn't say anything
about infrastructure.

36:50.918 --> 36:53.170
I think that if we were to attack
these two bridges

36:53.295 --> 36:55.797
and these choke points
down here in the south,

36:55.923 --> 36:58.008
we could stall his army from entering
the capital by three,

36:58.133 --> 36:59.301
maybe even four days.

37:01.637 --> 37:03.263
Do you agree with that assessment?

37:03.388 --> 37:04.306
Yes, sir.

37:04.431 --> 37:07.267
- Good. Take 'em out.
- Yes, sir.

37:16.318 --> 37:18.153
- This is Contreras.
- Smart.

37:19.488 --> 37:21.198
What are you going to do with the time?

37:21.323 --> 37:24.618
It's not what I'm gonna do with it.
It's what I want you to.

37:25.327 --> 37:28.622
I need you to convince the Russians
that it's in their best interest

37:28.747 --> 37:30.832
to authorize the peacekeeping force
to move in.

37:30.958 --> 37:32.167
As a private citizen?

37:33.669 --> 37:35.837
Preferably as Secretary of State.

37:36.505 --> 37:39.508
I know that you've retired from public
service, but your country needs you.

37:40.467 --> 37:41.843
I need you.

37:42.761 --> 37:45.889
Hell, you helped me get into this mess.
You might as well help me get out.

37:47.349 --> 37:50.310
Be more than happy to sweeten the deal
with a case of Wild Turkey.

37:53.146 --> 37:54.523
Well...

37:56.024 --> 37:57.901
I got to admit,

37:58.026 --> 38:01.071
I have been getting a little tired
of looking at my cattle all day.

38:03.156 --> 38:04.783
Mr. President...

38:06.201 --> 38:07.369
it's a deal.

38:08.495 --> 38:10.414
Thank you, Mr. President.

38:10.539 --> 38:12.207
Target is acquired, sir.

38:12.833 --> 38:14.876
We have good strike.
Target neutralized.

38:20.007 --> 38:21.466
All right.

38:22.050 --> 38:23.552
Just sign here, please.

38:34.062 --> 38:35.063
Aaron.

38:39.026 --> 38:40.569
So, what's next?

38:41.069 --> 38:44.406
I haven't gotten that far yet,
but... I'll let you know.

38:49.578 --> 38:52.039
Well, I'll try and do the job
as well as you did.

38:52.164 --> 38:53.290
No.

38:53.415 --> 38:54.750
Do better.

39:13.101 --> 39:14.936
We have so many questions
left unanswered.

39:15.062 --> 39:18.315
Obviously, we still don't know
who we can trust in the government.

39:18.440 --> 39:21.735
I know. I keep on thinking
about the Designated Survivor call.

39:21.860 --> 39:23.653
And if Langdon didn't make it,
then who did?

39:23.779 --> 39:25.572
I'm relying on you to find out.

39:25.697 --> 39:27.449
I need to focus on governing.

39:27.574 --> 39:30.619
I need to lead this country back
from this terrible tragedy.

39:31.119 --> 39:32.621
Are you still up for this?

39:33.872 --> 39:36.166
Mr. President,
I haven't even gotten started yet.

39:36.291 --> 39:37.876
Good.

39:38.877 --> 39:43.173
This is a Presidential Finding
absolving you from all FBI supervision.

39:43.298 --> 39:45.342
Until further notice,
you'll be reporting to me.

39:45.467 --> 39:47.552
Agent Ritter will be your liaison.

39:47.886 --> 39:50.013
- And Agent Foerstel?
- He'll be at your disposal.

39:50.138 --> 39:53.183
You'll be provided with a secure office
with secure communications.

39:53.308 --> 39:55.477
Nobody will know
what you're doing. Understood?

39:56.103 --> 39:57.479
Yes, sir.

39:57.604 --> 40:02.192
Agent Wells, I hereby authorize you
to use whatever means necessary,

40:02.317 --> 40:04.945
within the Constitution
of the United States of America,

40:05.070 --> 40:07.656
to find the people
involved in this conspiracy

40:07.781 --> 40:09.658
and bring them to justice.

40:12.411 --> 40:14.496
<i>I will not
let you down, Mr. President.</i>
