you're getting close to him,

01:22.145 --> 01:24.945

- How long has this been going on?
- What difference does that make?

02:31.051 --> 02:33.734
It makes a big difference,
because I'm your mother

02:33.759 --> 02:36.305
and I get to offer advice
and set some limits.

02:36.330 --> 02:37.722

02:37.747 --> 02:39.222
I get to decide what's right for me

and you don't get to tell
me who I can and can't date.

02:41.276 --> 02:42.448

Well, if you live in this house,

With a grown-up.

10:51.613 --> 10:52.524
It was bound to happen.

himself with work.

Um, except...

11:24.883 --> 11:26.417
What?

11:26.441 --> 11:28.448
Well, I just assumed
that dating an older guy

11:28.473 --> 11:29.751
with more experience,

11:29.776 --> 11:32.167
he would take me to a different place,

11:32.192 --> 11:33.760
sexually speaking.

11:33.786 --> 11:35.296
What place is that?

- Exactly.
- You mean you haven't?

11:53.110 --> 11:55.111
able to take care of business

11:55.136 --> 11:57.606
has been, well... me.

Actually, it's not, Taylor.

25:06.854 --> 25:09.058
Mom, this party was for Carter,

25:10.642 --> 25:11.821

25:11.846 --> 25:14.242
I didn't kick her out.

25:15.512 --> 25:17.637
I would never kick her out.

25:17.662 --> 25:21.112
You know, I try really
hard to be the cool mom,

25:21.137 --> 25:24.037
or the understanding mom,

25:24.062 --> 25:26.797
or, you know, the best
mom that I know how to be.

25:26.822 --> 25:28.520

25:28.545 --> 25:30.177
You guys are just butting heads right now,

25:30.202 --> 25:32.929

all that you're a great mom.

25:32.954 --> 25:34.455
You could have fooled me.

25:34.480 --> 25:37.417

and you are doing so well.

25:40.957 --> 25:42.958

drive her further away.

28:26.078 --> 28:28.616
it's been over a long time.

28:28.641 --> 28:30.082
We're separated.

28:30.107 --> 28:31.465
Okay.

28:31.490 --> 28:33.337
Uh...

28:33.362 --> 28:35.602
how long were you together?

28:35.627 --> 28:36.954
Less than a year.

28:36.979 --> 28:38.569
Did you love her?

28:39.444 --> 28:41.456
In the beginning, yeah.

28:41.481 --> 28:43.121
We started fighting all the time

28:43.146 --> 28:45.112
and things went south pretty fast.

28:45.137 --> 28:46.674
We broke up and then a week later,

28:46.699 --> 28:49.083
she found out she was pregnant.

28:49.108 --> 28:50.587
So you married her.

28:50.612 --> 28:53.043
I was trying to do the right thing,

28:53.068 --> 28:55.844
for her and our daughter.

28:57.172 --> 29:00.035
But that didn't last long.

29:02.200 --> 29:04.771
You gotta know...

29:05.621 --> 29:07.812
that's all in the past.

29:07.837 --> 29:10.108
All I want now is you.

29:11.181 --> 29:14.228
So why are you still married, Jared?

29:14.253 --> 29:15.938
Why did you not get a divorce?

29:15.963 --> 29:17.963
We've had disagreements about custody,

29:17.989 --> 29:23.404
and she refuses to sign the divorce papers.

29:27.360 --> 29:29.434
(sighing)

29:30.098 --> 29:31.232
You could have told me.

29:31.257 --> 29:32.124
I know.

29:32.149 --> 29:33.997
And I am so sorry.

29:34.021 --> 29:36.770
But, Carter, I see

29:36.795 --> 29:38.929
a future with you...

29:38.954 --> 29:41.419
and my little girl.

29:41.444 --> 29:44.234
I'm falling in love with you.

29:44.592 --> 29:45.925
(sniffling)

29:45.950 --> 29:51.724
(Upbeat jazz music)

29:52.879 --> 29:54.252
Hey.

29:54.277 --> 29:55.994
- Hey.
- You're up early.

29:56.019 --> 29:57.986
Yeah, I couldn't sleep.

29:58.029 --> 29:59.098
Why?

29:59.123 --> 30:01.264
You're not the one who embarrassed herself

30:01.289 --> 30:04.291
in front of a group of
strangers last night.

30:04.316 --> 30:06.202
They weren't all strangers.

30:07.461 --> 30:09.996
Really, why can't you sleep?

30:10.445 --> 30:13.447
I can't stop thinking about Max.

30:13.472 --> 30:14.972
I love him so much.

30:14.997 --> 30:17.012
I just want to be there for him,

30:17.037 --> 30:18.604
you know, like he always is for me.

30:18.629 --> 30:19.503
Yeah.

30:19.528 --> 30:20.795
I know you want to support him,

30:20.820 --> 30:22.518
but you gotta respect his wishes,

30:22.543 --> 30:25.899
even if all your instincts
are screaming otherwise,

30:25.924 --> 30:28.058
or so I'm told.

30:28.083 --> 30:30.233
I just want him to be okay.

30:30.258 --> 30:32.524
Yeah, he exorcised some of his demons

30:32.549 --> 30:33.910
all over our basement.

30:33.935 --> 30:35.918
Oh yeah, I heard about that.

30:36.123 --> 30:38.357
Some people have to let off steam.

30:38.524 --> 30:40.502
Some people do it by running

30:40.527 --> 30:42.031
or hitting golf balls

30:42.056 --> 30:44.505
or humiliating their children.

30:44.530 --> 30:46.525
- Mom.
- I'm joking.

30:46.550 --> 30:47.884
Sort of.

30:48.062 --> 30:49.229
I woke up this morning

30:49.254 --> 30:52.855
just hoping that it was all a bad dream.

30:52.880 --> 30:54.753
Yeah, it happened.

30:54.778 --> 30:56.306
You know where she is?

30:56.331 --> 30:58.800
She was up and out at the crack of dawn.

30:58.825 --> 31:00.926
Avoiding me, obviously.

Oh, yeah, you left it at the bar.

31:18.943 --> 31:20.344
Thank you.

31:21.618 --> 31:23.023
You okay?

31:23.048 --> 31:25.065
I guess.

31:25.270 --> 31:27.101
Okay, no, not really.

31:27.126 --> 31:29.092
What happened last night?

31:29.117 --> 31:32.305
Just... I found out some stuff about Jared.

31:32.330 --> 31:34.993
I don't know, he has this whole other life

31:35.018 --> 31:37.720
that happened before me
that he never told me about.

31:37.985 --> 31:39.521
So do you.

31:39.546 --> 31:42.034
With age comes baggage, right?

31:42.059 --> 31:43.393
Yeah, but this is different.

31:43.418 --> 31:45.272
I am trying so hard to be
understanding about this,

31:45.297 --> 31:47.777
but I really don't think
I can move past it.

31:48.588 --> 31:50.723
Take a beat and think it over.

31:50.886 --> 31:52.360
Only you can decide if it's something

31:52.385 --> 31:53.701
you want to sign on for.

31:53.726 --> 31:55.326
Okay.

31:55.351 --> 31:56.495
Thanks.

31:56.520 --> 31:59.260
Yeah, anytime.

31:59.827 --> 32:01.547
Hey, um...

32:01.572 --> 32:03.948
I'm sorry about all of
that drama last night.

32:03.973 --> 32:06.339
I had no idea my mom was
gonna show up like that.

32:06.364 --> 32:08.465
Well, I feel for her.

32:08.490 --> 32:10.512
Watching you leave the nest...

32:11.163 --> 32:12.498
She loves you.

32:12.523 --> 32:13.990
That's all this is.

32:14.015 --> 32:15.415
Well, I wish she had a different way

32:15.440 --> 32:17.463
of showing it sometimes.

32:17.856 --> 32:20.072
I think you should talk to her.

32:20.097 --> 32:21.757
I'm not saying you need to agree with her,

32:21.782 --> 32:23.788
but you should at least try.

32:23.813 --> 32:25.825
You, of all people, are encouraging me

32:25.850 --> 32:27.398
to make up with her.

32:27.424 --> 32:28.501
I know.

32:28.526 --> 32:30.579
But I only want what's best for you.

32:30.859 --> 32:33.205
That's all I've ever wanted.

32:35.606 --> 32:37.982
Come on.

32:39.249 --> 32:41.126
Oh, wow.

32:41.670 --> 32:44.717
I thought we would have
had more work to do today.

32:45.609 --> 32:47.288
Thanks.

32:47.313 --> 32:49.122
- He had someplace to be.
- Oh, yeah?

32:49.147 --> 32:51.648
Yeah, there is a...

32:51.716 --> 32:53.861
parole hearing for his father today.

32:53.886 --> 32:54.952
Really?

32:54.977 --> 32:56.292
They're not gonna let him out, are they?

32:56.317 --> 32:57.250
After what he did?

32:57.275 --> 32:58.186
Well, let's hope not,

32:58.211 --> 32:59.805
but I think he's pretty nervous about it.

32:59.830 --> 33:04.038
Maybe that's why he was on edge yesterday.

33:05.559 --> 33:07.191
Yeah.

33:07.216 --> 33:08.488
Did Taylor go with him?

33:08.513 --> 33:10.176
No, he didn't want any company.

33:10.201 --> 33:14.107
I think he's just struggling
with not having been able to

33:14.132 --> 33:15.637
protect his mom all those years ago.

33:15.662 --> 33:17.030
You know how protective he is.

33:17.055 --> 33:18.455
Yeah, I get that.

33:20.842 --> 33:23.567
I'm sorry about what happened.

33:23.592 --> 33:25.914
I didn't realize that he was stressing.

33:26.121 --> 33:27.938
I should have kept a cooler head.

33:27.963 --> 33:29.066
Gabe.

33:29.091 --> 33:31.407
You're both great kids

33:31.432 --> 33:34.938
and you've been going through a lot lately.

33:35.466 --> 33:36.922
Way too much.

33:36.947 --> 33:38.214
You still think that.

33:38.239 --> 33:40.018
- Really?
- Yeah.

33:40.050 --> 33:42.821
We all get off track once in a while

33:42.846 --> 33:45.261
when we've had a lot to deal with.

33:46.192 --> 33:48.365
It was pretty awful, too.

33:48.961 --> 33:51.509
You just lost your dad.

33:52.230 --> 33:55.021
I knew how much you were hurting.

33:56.471 --> 33:58.796
I need you to know this.

33:59.599 --> 34:02.341
I really loved your father...

34:02.366 --> 34:06.204
which is why I feel the way I do about you.

34:09.079 --> 34:11.217
Thank you.

34:12.853 --> 34:14.793
For hanging in there.

34:14.819 --> 34:17.635
You're very welcome.

34:25.771 --> 34:27.706
What are you doing here?

34:27.732 --> 34:30.045
I heard you had something to take care of.

34:33.913 --> 34:35.920
♪

34:38.376 --> 34:39.681
You ready?

34:39.706 --> 34:41.494
To testify against my dad?

34:41.518 --> 34:43.516
Not quite.

34:43.596 --> 34:44.984
I hear that.

34:45.009 --> 34:47.614
I'm here, if you need me.

34:47.639 --> 34:49.438
That's very stand-up of you.

34:49.464 --> 34:52.772
It's probably hard to believe as of late,

34:52.797 --> 34:55.657
but I can be a stand-up guy.

34:55.681 --> 34:57.844
I know you can.

34:59.077 --> 35:02.344
I appreciate what you did for Taylor.

35:04.366 --> 35:06.487
I shouldn't have thrown it in your face.

35:06.512 --> 35:07.853
That wasn't cool.

35:07.878 --> 35:10.129
I shouldn't have let it get to me.

35:12.935 --> 35:14.760
I'd do most anything

35:14.785 --> 35:16.631
for the people that I care about.

35:17.658 --> 35:19.365
But two different times

35:19.390 --> 35:23.232
now with two people I love most...

35:25.142 --> 35:26.635
bad stuff has gone down

35:26.660 --> 35:28.328
and I wasn't there to help.

35:29.701 --> 35:31.969
You're here now, aren't you?

35:31.994 --> 35:33.807
Might not make a difference.

35:33.832 --> 35:36.129
But you're still fighting.

35:36.154 --> 35:39.551
And you've got me here as backup.

35:40.461 --> 35:42.743
Didn't see that one coming.

35:44.220 --> 35:46.219
Look...

35:46.244 --> 35:48.935
I'll always have feelings for Taylor,

35:48.960 --> 35:52.359
but I respect what it
is the two of you have,

35:52.384 --> 35:55.557
and I will just have to deal with that.

35:57.781 --> 36:00.250
Thanks for coming all the way down here.

36:01.902 --> 36:04.160
No problem.

36:10.707 --> 36:12.040
Still no?

36:12.065 --> 36:14.359
Actually...

36:15.182 --> 36:16.728
yeah.

36:16.753 --> 36:18.040
When?

36:18.066 --> 36:20.238
- Last night.
- Last night?

36:20.262 --> 36:21.948
So what have the last
eight hours been about?

36:21.973 --> 36:22.861
Truth?

36:22.886 --> 36:24.616
Yes, truth.

36:24.641 --> 36:26.451
I got greedy.

36:29.149 --> 36:31.303
Dude, you wanna see that new
horror movie this weekend?

36:31.328 --> 36:33.226
Oh, the one with the dead fish people?

36:33.251 --> 36:35.399
- Yeah, it looks ridiculous.
- I've actually heard it's getting

36:35.424 --> 36:36.726
- pretty killer reviews.
- Really?

36:36.751 --> 36:37.431
Yeah.

36:37.456 --> 36:40.359
Uh, I was told that this was
the scene of an apocalypse.

36:40.384 --> 36:42.030
- No?
- No.

36:42.473 --> 36:43.874
What did I miss?

36:43.899 --> 36:46.039
Why don't I get some sodas for us?

36:46.064 --> 36:48.149
I'll be right back, guys.

36:52.170 --> 36:53.712
Okay.

36:53.737 --> 36:55.239
What is going on?

36:55.263 --> 36:57.862
Gabe showed up for the parole hearing.

36:57.887 --> 36:59.501
I thought you didn't want anyone there.

36:59.526 --> 37:00.425
No, I didn't.

37:00.450 --> 37:03.184
And I thank you for respecting that.

37:03.209 --> 37:04.138
Of course.

37:04.164 --> 37:06.916
Ended up meaning a lot
that he showed up, though.

37:08.739 --> 37:10.241
It was kind of out of control,

37:10.266 --> 37:11.479
but he's a good dude.

37:11.505 --> 37:14.991
And...  maybe I should

37:15.016 --> 37:16.885
ask for help when I need it.

37:17.120 --> 37:20.233
Yeah... maybe.

37:22.327 --> 37:24.308
I love you.

37:24.333 --> 37:25.670
I love you, too.

37:25.695 --> 37:27.014
So how'd it go?

37:27.039 --> 37:28.366
We'll see.

37:28.391 --> 37:30.453
It was weird seeing him.

37:31.206 --> 37:33.335
But I told them why they
shouldn't let him out

37:33.360 --> 37:34.861
and I feel good about that.

37:34.886 --> 37:37.073
Well, I'm glad that Gabe was there for you.

37:37.098 --> 37:38.885
Yeah, me too.

37:39.249 --> 37:41.884
Sounds like I'm the one
who should be jealous.

37:41.983 --> 37:43.926
He and I are going steady.

37:43.951 --> 37:45.023
Shut up.

37:45.047 --> 37:46.901
Gladly.

37:53.870 --> 37:55.071

37:55.096 --> 37:57.791
- Hey.
- Hey.

37:57.816 --> 37:59.287
You taking over around here?

37:59.312 --> 38:02.434
Just...  missing your dad.

38:02.852 --> 38:05.608
You know how he hums when he writes?

38:05.633 --> 38:06.524
Yes.

38:06.550 --> 38:08.061
Used to drive me crazy.

38:08.086 --> 38:11.037
But now I would kill to hear it.

38:11.061 --> 38:12.772
Life's changed not having him around.

38:12.797 --> 38:15.197
Got used to him being my sounding board.

38:15.222 --> 38:16.719
Even if we disagreed,

38:16.744 --> 38:19.220
he'd always show me the other side,

38:19.298 --> 38:23.332
which is not my strong point, I'm thinking.

38:24.091 --> 38:25.558
Carter...

38:25.585 --> 38:28.173
I am so sorry.

38:29.042 --> 38:30.845
Me too.

38:31.038 --> 38:34.518
Look, I know you were
coming from a good place

38:34.543 --> 38:37.237
and you were just trying
to protect me, but...

38:38.309 --> 38:40.438
you can't ambush me like that.

38:40.463 --> 38:42.044
- I know.
- It's not fair.

38:42.069 --> 38:44.061
And if I could take it back, I would.

38:44.086 --> 38:46.937
I know it's not an excuse, but...

38:46.962 --> 38:49.497
it's very...

38:49.522 --> 38:52.705
difficult for me to watch
you become a woman...

38:53.673 --> 38:55.808
because I really didn't get to see you

38:55.833 --> 38:58.080
being a little girl.

I need you to know that this is your home.

I know.
