02:46.125 --> 02:48.125
Did you get lucky last night?

02:48.208 --> 02:49.666
Of course. Did you?

02:54.875 --> 02:56.750
I am an open window.

02:57.125 --> 02:58.625
Over infinity.

03:00.541 --> 03:03.250
A whole new world on your wrist.

03:03.833 --> 03:06.083
I am Giguere de Corto.

04:12.750 --> 04:13.750
It's my son.

04:15.458 --> 04:17.166
He hasn't returned my calls.

04:18.250 --> 04:19.625
It's not like him.

04:20.916 --> 04:22.541
You know what happened?

04:26.166 --> 04:28.708
Detected in the Ether an hour ago.

04:30.416 --> 04:32.125
You sure you want to see?

04:36.583 --> 04:37.583
Yes.

04:39.833 --> 04:40.833
I want to.

05:21.083 --> 05:23.458
Step back... Step ba...

06:22.833 --> 06:24.416
I know where I left it.

06:24.500 --> 06:25.916
You can see in my record.

06:26.458 --> 06:28.625
I left it in the hotel bathroom.

06:41.791 --> 06:43.083
Show me the maid.

06:59.000 --> 07:00.125
Can't help you.

07:00.791 --> 07:03.958
Well someone else came in.
It didn't just walk out on its own.

07:04.791 --> 07:05.791
Wish I could.

07:07.750 --> 07:08.750
We're leaving.

07:17.666 --> 07:20.041
You didn't show her what happened
a minute earlier.

07:27.166 --> 07:29.416
Or what happened four hours later

07:29.500 --> 07:31.375
when she sold the bracelet
to pay rent.

07:32.250 --> 07:35.958
There was just something about that woman
that annoyed the fuck out of me.

07:37.500 --> 07:39.791
At this moment,
my client feared for his life.

07:43.541 --> 07:44.541
Don't do it.

07:44.958 --> 07:46.458
I haven't done anything.

07:48.500 --> 07:50.958
He had a split-second to defend himself.

07:57.250 --> 08:00.000
There was no way to know
he wasn't reaching for a gun.

08:10.958 --> 08:13.708
You can see from the infant's
point of view

08:13.791 --> 08:16.666
my client cooperated fully
with authorities.

08:30.875 --> 08:34.207
It's what he was doing an hour earlier
that concerns me,

08:34.291 --> 08:35.500
and perhaps, a jury.

08:37.750 --> 08:40.875
Your client's judgment was
severely impaired.

08:53.375 --> 08:55.416
Let's discuss a plea agreement.

08:57.416 --> 08:58.666
- Sir, there's...
- I see it.

09:17.250 --> 09:19.125
Charlie, how are the girls?

09:19.333 --> 09:21.708
Still spending money like I got it.

09:24.458 --> 09:25.625
James Cray.

09:26.208 --> 09:27.541
Shot between the eyes.

09:27.708 --> 09:31.000
- An hour ago and change.
- Why is there a block on his record?

09:33.875 --> 09:34.875
Charlie.

09:35.291 --> 09:36.625
When do we know who shot him?

09:44.041 --> 09:45.708
Take a look how it ends.

09:47.791 --> 09:48.791
You're cleared.

09:58.875 --> 10:00.291
He enters his apartment.

10:06.083 --> 10:08.250
Five minutes later,
he's checking stock prices.

10:08.333 --> 10:11.500
- That's when it gets interesting.
- Did I say I wasn't interested?

10:27.916 --> 10:29.083
Shit.

10:29.625 --> 10:31.458
Who are you?

10:31.541 --> 10:33.250
He sees what the killer sees.

10:33.875 --> 10:35.083
To hide himself.

10:35.166 --> 10:38.041
The killers hacks
into Cray's Mind's Eye.

10:38.125 --> 10:40.166
- Cray's point of view...
- What are you doing?

10:40.250 --> 10:41.833
...now the killer's point of view.

10:41.916 --> 10:43.416
He's looking at himself.

10:44.875 --> 10:46.666
Before Cray could make sense of it...

10:46.750 --> 10:48.625
Please, don't.

10:50.666 --> 10:51.666
Please.

11:00.166 --> 11:01.875
Who could hack a human being?

11:01.958 --> 11:02.958
It gets better.

11:03.041 --> 11:04.208
As in worse?

11:04.291 --> 11:06.375
Look at the metadata time of death.

11:08.708 --> 11:11.833
Timeline ends at 1810 and 24 seconds.

11:16.791 --> 11:17.791
Jesus.

11:18.833 --> 11:21.791
Not just the identity-theft
to hack the man's eye,

11:22.000 --> 11:24.291
the victim's alone
when he's killed.

11:25.041 --> 11:26.708
Or that's what it looks like.

11:27.541 --> 11:29.083
Shooter has no signature.

11:29.333 --> 11:30.875
No identifying meta trail.

11:32.208 --> 11:35.500
What's the world coming to when
murderers won't tell us who they are?

11:38.583 --> 11:42.208
Makes a change from picking up crazies
we already know are guilty.

11:44.708 --> 11:46.625
We actually got ourselves a whodunit.

11:47.166 --> 11:48.166
Two.

11:48.708 --> 11:50.208
Matches another case.

11:51.708 --> 11:56.250
Baltimore, July, also got his POV hacked,
also by a shooter who wasn't there.

12:06.625 --> 12:07.625
What's happening?

12:10.416 --> 12:11.416
What is this?

12:15.125 --> 12:18.583
They thought it was an anomaly,
but now they want to reopen the case.

12:18.666 --> 12:21.916
Last visitor
was of the female persuasion.

12:22.416 --> 12:24.625
- The woman's ID?
- Scrubbed.

12:25.833 --> 12:27.875
By the by, this doesn't get out.

12:27.958 --> 12:30.375
Let the press gossip.
Officially, it's a suicide.

12:31.958 --> 12:34.375
Charlie, this morning downtown...

12:35.708 --> 12:36.875
I saw a ghost.

12:37.458 --> 12:38.458
Face without a name?

12:39.000 --> 12:41.541
Girl was a blank slate,
no digital footprint.

12:41.875 --> 12:44.333
Thought maybe it was a glitch,
ran her again, nothing.

12:45.416 --> 12:46.500
Another cipher.

12:47.291 --> 12:48.333
Seeing too many.

12:49.250 --> 12:50.333
Or not seeing.

12:51.875 --> 12:53.875
- Send her to me.
- You got it.

13:41.250 --> 13:42.708
You with me, Sal?

13:43.833 --> 13:45.208
Yeah, of course we are.

13:51.375 --> 13:52.375
Damn.

13:53.333 --> 13:55.375
Oh, Jesus.

13:56.458 --> 13:57.458
I'm out of here.

14:00.250 --> 14:01.666
What were you watching?

14:03.458 --> 14:05.875
Show me what you were watching right now

14:05.958 --> 14:07.791
or you're never going to see me again.

14:09.291 --> 14:10.291
Show me, Sal.

14:11.458 --> 14:12.458
I can't.

14:23.125 --> 14:24.125
No.

14:25.125 --> 14:26.666
I really can't.

14:56.458 --> 14:58.333
So what are we looking at, Lester?

14:58.916 --> 15:00.666
We analyzed the victim's record.

15:01.125 --> 15:03.000
A week ago, an edit.

15:04.125 --> 15:05.958
Technically, it's a duplication.

15:08.041 --> 15:11.166
This footage has been rock and rolled.
To stretch it...

15:11.250 --> 15:13.500
and if you analyze it carefully...

15:14.916 --> 15:17.958
we'll see he spends too long on
several pages in the book.

15:20.125 --> 15:22.458
Other anomalies with this footage...

15:23.541 --> 15:25.875
you compare stock activity
in his Mind's Eye

15:25.958 --> 15:28.375
with what actually happened to the market
on the day.

15:28.458 --> 15:30.333
It's been elongated too, but...

15:30.416 --> 15:33.125
unless you're looking for it,
you would never see it.

15:33.750 --> 15:37.208
This is very good, so...

15:37.625 --> 15:40.000
meticulous fucking work.

15:40.083 --> 15:42.583
But it all masked deleted activity.

15:42.666 --> 15:45.500
Illegal activity that the SEC missed.

15:46.083 --> 15:49.458
A day later, he's cleared
of an insider trading charge.

15:51.416 --> 15:52.416
Then there's this.

15:55.708 --> 15:59.208
It's kind of hard to hear with the music
playing in his head, but...

15:59.291 --> 16:00.291
that.

16:05.500 --> 16:08.500
- That's a doorbell.
- Cray had a mystery guest.

16:08.625 --> 16:11.541
They covered their tracks,
no evidence of the meeting.

16:11.625 --> 16:13.666
There was nothing
in the victim's background

16:13.750 --> 16:17.583
to suggest he had the ability
to launder his own record, so...

16:17.666 --> 16:18.833
Hacker for hire.

16:20.541 --> 16:23.375
Jordan Nees, has edits too.

16:24.125 --> 16:26.875
Music producer with a history
of heroin addiction.

16:26.958 --> 16:28.958
Had his latest relapse scrubbed.

16:29.625 --> 16:31.166
So he wouldn't lose his job.

16:32.625 --> 16:33.875
This is a nightmare.

16:35.541 --> 16:38.750
The hypothetical... isn't.

16:39.750 --> 16:41.833
Not only can they get into the house,

16:41.916 --> 16:43.791
they're moving the furniture around.

16:44.833 --> 16:48.458
Charlie, you know that girl I saw
yesterday on South William.

16:49.041 --> 16:52.666
She matches the description of the last
person to see Nees alive.

16:54.875 --> 16:57.708
Last night, she got deleted
from my history.

16:57.791 --> 17:01.125
Thought it might be something in
the Ether, but nothing else is missing.

17:01.541 --> 17:05.665
Now, I'm thinking that someone got
into my life record and erased her.

17:08.625 --> 17:09.790
Send her back to me.

17:10.290 --> 17:12.833
I was going to ask you the same thing.

17:14.915 --> 17:15.915
Mine's gone.

18:06.625 --> 18:07.916
The moment I saw her...

18:10.208 --> 18:11.458
now just a black hole.

18:15.041 --> 18:16.250
Not just me.

18:17.250 --> 18:20.625
Ten other people in the street that day
now have edits in their record.

18:21.333 --> 18:22.958
The moments they looked at her...

18:23.166 --> 18:24.291
random strangers.

18:26.333 --> 18:28.166
She must have built an algorithm.

18:28.416 --> 18:31.458
Automatically searches for her
and erases any trace it finds.

18:32.875 --> 18:34.791
Blacks her out and leaves a gap.

18:37.625 --> 18:39.250
None of the people in the street

18:39.333 --> 18:43.000
significant enough in their life
to warrant a proper cover-up.

18:43.083 --> 18:45.708
And anyone who is significant
has a nasty habit of dying.

18:47.625 --> 18:50.250
Hard to erase their memories
without erasing them.

18:50.916 --> 18:52.916
Handful of people smart enough
to do this.

18:53.625 --> 18:55.708
Generally too smart
to go on a killing spree.

18:55.791 --> 18:58.041
Unless the gifted mind is a sick one.

18:58.333 --> 18:59.958
They do a surveillance search?

19:01.041 --> 19:02.916
With what? We don't have a face anymore.

19:03.291 --> 19:04.291
Fuck.

19:05.458 --> 19:07.291
We don't have a name, a face...

19:07.625 --> 19:08.916
no idea where she is.

19:09.500 --> 19:10.500
Yeah.

19:11.458 --> 19:13.125
We got exactly nothing.

19:18.583 --> 19:19.583
Hungry?

19:20.083 --> 19:21.083
I'm good.

19:23.666 --> 19:25.083
You have arrived.

20:31.541 --> 20:32.541
Hey.

20:33.791 --> 20:34.875
Hi, Sal.

20:35.333 --> 20:36.958
- It's late.
- I know.

20:38.500 --> 20:39.916
Tomorrow's his birthday.

20:40.875 --> 20:42.458
You think I don't know that?

20:43.166 --> 20:44.166
Ten.

20:45.166 --> 20:47.166
Please stop. He's gone.

20:48.125 --> 20:49.500
He would have been ten.

20:51.291 --> 20:54.375
You got to stop doing this,
to yourself and to me.

20:55.333 --> 20:56.333
Doing what?

20:56.875 --> 20:59.291
I'm keeping his memory alive.
What's wrong with that?

20:59.916 --> 21:01.458
The memory's not going anywhere.

21:01.750 --> 21:03.458
By the looks of it, neither are you.

21:03.666 --> 21:04.666
Sal.

21:04.708 --> 21:08.375
Does he have to be on the call
every time we talk?

21:09.500 --> 21:12.083
Conrad, I'm not going to keep her long,
it's just..

21:12.166 --> 21:13.250
I know...

21:13.791 --> 21:16.041
but you can't keep calling all hours.

21:16.333 --> 21:17.791
She's not your wife anymore.

21:18.875 --> 21:20.708
It's his fucking birthday.

21:24.500 --> 21:25.500
Kristen.

21:27.000 --> 21:28.000
Are you drunk?

21:28.916 --> 21:29.958
You're swaying.

21:30.541 --> 21:31.666
Not fucking drunk.

21:33.458 --> 21:36.875
I'm tired. I've been working...
I haven't had a drink for days.

21:37.541 --> 21:39.750
Show me the last ten minutes
of your record.

21:40.708 --> 21:41.916
You know what?

21:42.708 --> 21:43.833
I've got to go.

22:27.000 --> 22:28.000
Help!

22:33.833 --> 22:35.958
Please, kill me.

22:36.041 --> 22:37.666
Don't hurt her, please.

22:38.833 --> 22:40.833
Don't, please.

22:41.958 --> 22:42.958
No!

22:52.750 --> 22:54.625
Mind's Eye hijacked.

22:56.541 --> 22:57.541
Both of them.

22:58.625 --> 23:01.000
The thing is, sir, the perp's POV...

23:01.916 --> 23:04.125
I can't identify it.
It's got no signature.

23:04.208 --> 23:05.583
No shit.

23:08.041 --> 23:09.250
First responder.

23:10.083 --> 23:11.875
I was in the neighborhood, sir.

23:12.166 --> 23:13.291
Where is everyone?

23:14.166 --> 23:15.166
On their way.

23:15.916 --> 23:17.083
Who else is here?

23:17.916 --> 23:18.916
Housekeeper.

23:19.833 --> 23:21.000
She was downstairs.

23:46.750 --> 23:48.166
She's back in her room.

23:48.250 --> 23:49.291
She's a mess.

23:50.500 --> 23:51.708
I spoke to her.

23:54.125 --> 23:56.375
Ma'am, can you describe the visitor?

23:57.958 --> 23:59.791
Long, brown hair...

23:59.875 --> 24:00.875
Twenty-five?

24:00.958 --> 24:02.958
I only saw her for a second.

24:03.500 --> 24:06.208
Just us and her in the house now?

24:07.750 --> 24:09.500
That's one hell of a rat.

24:12.958 --> 24:14.958
There's four of us in the house.

24:16.000 --> 24:17.791
One of us is being shy.

24:19.666 --> 24:20.916
Jam your transmitter.

25:07.625 --> 25:09.250
Ah, fuck.

26:12.750 --> 26:14.708
Please, kill me.

26:15.000 --> 26:17.000
Don't hurt her, please.

26:17.625 --> 26:19.625
Don't, please.

26:20.875 --> 26:21.875
No!

26:31.166 --> 26:32.166
Lesbian couple.

26:32.750 --> 26:33.791
Neither was out.

26:33.875 --> 26:34.708
One...

26:34.791 --> 26:38.666
daughter of a prominent Christian right
senator up for re-election.

26:38.916 --> 26:40.166
In the last week,

26:40.833 --> 26:44.083
the women had themselves removed
from each other's lives.

26:44.375 --> 26:45.500
For appearances,

26:46.291 --> 26:47.375
no easy task.

26:48.083 --> 26:49.375
Dating for a year.

26:51.041 --> 26:53.458
We're starting to get a picture
of our hacker

26:53.541 --> 26:55.750
even though we don't have
a fucking picture.

26:56.666 --> 26:58.000
Lives in the Ether.

26:58.875 --> 27:01.166
Makes her living covering up sub-crime

27:01.250 --> 27:04.500
not detected automatically.
Secrets, affairs,

27:04.583 --> 27:08.000
non-violent white-collar so-called
"victimless crime."

27:08.916 --> 27:12.708
She's a master editor who cuts together
a believable alibi

27:12.791 --> 27:14.833
to replace the unwanted act
in the record.

27:14.916 --> 27:17.583
Most of all, she erases herself.

27:18.166 --> 27:20.125
And now, her clients are getting erased.

27:21.041 --> 27:22.875
Why bother to meet the client?

27:24.041 --> 27:25.208
If she can do it remote.

27:25.291 --> 27:29.166
She doesn't want a lot of back-and-forth
communication, leave a trail,

27:29.333 --> 27:30.625
get intercepted.

27:30.708 --> 27:33.708
Wants to be paid in the only
currency that can't be hacked. Cash.

27:33.791 --> 27:34.791
Remember cash?

27:35.083 --> 27:38.416
And here I was thinking
she was all about the personal touch.

27:38.541 --> 27:41.833
She might be. Trace markers
are unregistered, but match.

27:41.916 --> 27:44.583
Suggests she might have been intimate
with her victims.

27:45.000 --> 27:46.375
Is that what this is?

27:47.291 --> 27:48.875
No one gets to kiss and tell?

27:49.333 --> 27:50.666
Wouldn't be the first.

27:51.333 --> 27:54.541
Seems like every customer she takes
to bed ends up DOA.

27:55.250 --> 27:58.166
And this girl has more than one way
to kill you.

28:01.500 --> 28:03.750
Last night, when I was chasing her...

28:11.958 --> 28:13.416
...that's where it starts.

28:14.041 --> 28:15.916
She changes what I see.

28:16.791 --> 28:17.791
The stairs...

28:19.291 --> 28:20.291
the stretch.

28:21.416 --> 28:22.708
They look normal.

28:24.041 --> 28:26.166
Not to me. It's an optical illusion.

28:26.708 --> 28:30.416
Which later disappears from my record.
And it doesn't end there.

28:31.708 --> 28:32.708
At this moment...

28:34.416 --> 28:35.458
I'm seeing...

28:36.041 --> 28:38.000
a train at the platform.

28:40.875 --> 28:42.416
A train that isn't there.

28:42.500 --> 28:44.125
I swear to God.

28:53.250 --> 28:54.666
Real one could have killed me.

28:58.875 --> 29:00.250
Placing a moving image...

29:01.083 --> 29:03.333
over a record in real time...

29:05.916 --> 29:06.916
It's possible.

29:09.666 --> 29:12.083
How the fuck do we stop this bitch?

29:13.375 --> 29:16.791
We do what every one of the victims did
before they were killed.

29:17.833 --> 29:18.833
We hire her.

29:21.708 --> 29:22.916
I'll be the bait.

29:25.541 --> 29:26.666
I go undercover.

29:27.333 --> 29:29.000
The girl likes big shots.

29:29.375 --> 29:31.583
I make it look like I work
in a brokerage house.

29:31.666 --> 29:35.125
Get phony friends, family, fiancée,
profile history.

29:37.208 --> 29:42.000
All my online activity looks like
I made a success of my life.

29:43.750 --> 29:48.000
A month, all to give us enough material to
stretch over my law enforcement career.

29:57.541 --> 30:01.833
My new life's just going to look a little
repetitive to anyone who looks back.

30:03.666 --> 30:05.750
Lester's got to be in on it.

30:06.250 --> 30:09.041
He's a freelance contractor.
He should be safe.

30:18.875 --> 30:23.083
Once I look legit, I do something
the new me wants to erase.

30:24.791 --> 30:25.833
KRYSTAL 23, Escort

30:32.083 --> 30:33.083
Thanks.

30:34.166 --> 30:35.166
Drink?

30:37.916 --> 30:38.916
I don't drink.

30:40.916 --> 30:41.958
What do you do?

30:46.125 --> 30:48.333
Yes.

30:56.583 --> 30:57.583
Thank you.

31:04.625 --> 31:08.500
Naturally, I do what any guilty boyfriend
does after having sex with a hooker,

31:08.583 --> 31:09.875
I call my fiancée.

31:17.458 --> 31:20.666
Next day, I get scared my girlfriend
is going to ask to see my records

31:20.750 --> 31:22.416
so I try to contact our hacker.

31:23.500 --> 31:27.166
Same dark Ether bulletin boards
used by the other victims.

31:27.750 --> 31:28.958
We know her M.O.

31:29.583 --> 31:30.875
She'll come to me.

31:31.666 --> 31:35.375
Of course, we rule out applicants
who don't match the description.

31:40.041 --> 31:41.041
Sol Grayson?

31:44.125 --> 31:45.166
Changed my mind.

32:26.500 --> 32:28.458
By the way, I'll need a boatload of cash.

32:29.750 --> 32:34.041
She can see past our metadata, so
I don't want a cop within a mile of me.

32:34.500 --> 32:37.166
Since we can't communicate without
blowing my cover,

32:37.250 --> 32:38.416
we use a signal.

33:18.833 --> 33:20.125
Don't look at me.

33:21.250 --> 33:24.041
What can I do for you, Sol Grayson,
stockbroker?

33:26.083 --> 33:27.916
I want to get rid of an affair.

33:28.750 --> 33:32.333
- Well, not even an affair really. I...
- I don't care.

33:33.916 --> 33:34.916
Cash only.

33:37.833 --> 33:40.291
Let's go somewhere we won't be disturbed.

33:41.041 --> 33:42.166
Your apartment.

33:45.541 --> 33:48.625
When she does show, all we've got to do
is get her close enough

33:48.708 --> 33:50.916
for Lester to scan her frequency.

33:51.708 --> 33:55.166
We trace her chain of proxies
to her record of the killings.

33:56.250 --> 33:57.416
We got her.

34:23.416 --> 34:24.416
Drink?

35:08.458 --> 35:09.458
I'm in.

35:10.125 --> 35:11.250
Just like that?

35:11.666 --> 35:12.833
Here we go.

35:32.833 --> 35:34.166
Here's how it works.

35:34.250 --> 35:36.208
Believe it or not, I got a policy.

35:36.916 --> 35:38.291
To respect your privacy,

35:38.375 --> 35:40.666
I'm only going to look at
what you want me to see.

35:40.916 --> 35:41.916
Nothing more.

35:42.833 --> 35:44.666
That is, unless you cross me.

35:46.333 --> 35:47.333
Do that,

35:47.833 --> 35:49.750
and you will wish you were fucking dead.

35:52.666 --> 35:53.833
Sounds reasonable.

35:55.541 --> 35:56.541
Well?

35:57.791 --> 35:58.791
A week ago...

36:00.083 --> 36:01.083
Monday...

36:02.625 --> 36:05.541
about 11-10-23-10.

36:09.166 --> 36:10.208
I see her.

36:10.666 --> 36:12.125
That the girl you want gone?

36:16.666 --> 36:17.666
Yeah.

36:19.333 --> 36:21.916
You want me to fix her side too?
I can leave a gap.

36:25.250 --> 36:27.708
What if she looks back
and see it's gone?

36:28.000 --> 36:30.291
Doesn't seem like the type of girl
who looks back.

36:30.875 --> 36:33.875
Better not to leave it lying around.
She could use it against you.

36:40.125 --> 36:43.541
Yes.

36:53.083 --> 36:55.791
What do you want in its place
to fill the timeline?

36:56.833 --> 36:58.666
Went to bed earlier than I did.

36:59.166 --> 37:01.916
Problem is you called your girlfriend
after the hooker left.

37:02.583 --> 37:03.791
Oh, yeah.

37:03.875 --> 37:07.833
And I'm guessing it's the girlfriend
you don't want seeing the rendezvous.

37:08.625 --> 37:11.833
If your girl looked back,
she'd see that the call isn't there.

37:14.041 --> 37:15.208
A night at a bar?

37:16.208 --> 37:17.541
Too many other people.

37:17.875 --> 37:19.000
Complicates things.

37:21.333 --> 37:23.875
I'll make it look like you were alone
in your apartment.

37:24.500 --> 37:27.375
From another night that you were
alone in your apartment.

37:29.625 --> 37:31.958
Luckily, there are a few to choose from.

37:34.625 --> 37:36.291
No wonder you hired a hooker.

37:39.333 --> 37:41.125
I'll show you what I'm doing.

37:46.625 --> 37:48.875
It's all the media you consume
I got to fix.

37:50.250 --> 37:52.083
How jealous is your girlfriend?

37:52.750 --> 37:55.750
Anyone looking close,
especially another fixer...

37:59.041 --> 38:01.541
they're gonna see the joins
unless I'm here 'til next week.

38:02.000 --> 38:03.625
Worse things in the world?

38:04.833 --> 38:06.041
You can't afford me.

38:06.916 --> 38:09.583
Yes.

38:13.916 --> 38:15.333
So business is good.

38:16.625 --> 38:19.958
You'd be surprised what people want
to pretend never happened.

38:26.208 --> 38:27.791
Any job you wouldn't take?

38:31.541 --> 38:33.666
Help someone get away with murder.

38:35.000 --> 38:36.541
Depends who they killed.

38:42.000 --> 38:43.375
See ya next time.

38:51.375 --> 38:53.875
I'm going to have to remove me
from your life, too.

38:55.333 --> 38:56.333
This, tonight.

39:11.291 --> 39:12.333
Where are you?

39:15.750 --> 39:17.791
So strange to look at you and see nothing.

39:17.875 --> 39:19.041
No name.

39:19.416 --> 39:20.833
No data, nothing.

39:20.916 --> 39:22.750
You must get a lot of stares.

39:23.625 --> 39:24.875
I don't go out much.

39:24.958 --> 39:26.833
And when I do, I keep my head down.

39:28.041 --> 39:29.708
People think it's a mistake.

39:30.500 --> 39:32.166
Why not use an alias?

39:33.708 --> 39:35.958
I don't want to exist as someone else.

39:37.666 --> 39:39.000
I don't want to exist.

39:40.750 --> 39:41.833
You have a name.

39:43.041 --> 39:44.041
I do.

39:52.625 --> 39:53.708
What, is that it?

39:54.083 --> 39:56.583
I don't mean to be rude.
I got another customer.

39:58.750 --> 40:00.958
What about people with memories of you?

40:01.625 --> 40:02.625
Like me?

40:03.625 --> 40:05.208
You can't get rid of memories.

40:06.416 --> 40:07.750
I can think of a way.

40:10.458 --> 40:13.583
I'm going to take a wild guess
that you don't have a permit for that.

40:14.125 --> 40:15.125
Turn around.

40:18.333 --> 40:19.333
Look away.

40:22.625 --> 40:23.625
Don't worry.

40:24.041 --> 40:26.333
I'll get rid of everything of me
in your record

40:26.416 --> 40:28.291
up until the last time you
looked at me.

40:31.250 --> 40:32.250
Just now.

40:51.083 --> 40:52.083
Sal?

40:55.083 --> 40:56.458
I got her fifth proxy.

40:57.625 --> 40:59.041
I don't have her record.

40:59.958 --> 41:00.958
Yet.

41:08.916 --> 41:10.166
Why didn't she kill you?

41:10.250 --> 41:12.083
Oh, sorry to disappoint you, Charlie.

41:12.166 --> 41:13.958
Oh, that's right. She didn't fuck you.

41:14.375 --> 41:15.708
Not her type, I guess.

41:16.083 --> 41:18.125
What's to say she doesn't go
into your record

41:18.208 --> 41:20.458
and see her stockbroker suddenly
become a cop?

41:20.625 --> 41:21.666
I don't think so.

41:22.208 --> 41:23.083
She said something.

41:23.166 --> 41:26.125
She said,
"I only look at what you want me to see."

41:26.208 --> 41:27.791
Principled serial killer.

41:28.250 --> 41:29.333
I don't know why.

41:30.041 --> 41:31.083
I believed her.

41:37.375 --> 41:38.833
Reinforcements.

41:39.750 --> 41:42.750
Tech specialist, CT unit.

41:43.750 --> 41:46.291
Commissioner's personal recommendation.

41:47.166 --> 41:48.166
My.

41:51.750 --> 41:53.750
Sal, Cyrus Frear.

41:54.708 --> 41:55.708
Hi.

41:56.750 --> 41:57.750
Hi.

42:11.000 --> 42:12.000
We're in.

42:29.291 --> 42:30.750
What happens now?

42:31.750 --> 42:34.666
- We watch.
- We can only see through her eyes,

42:34.750 --> 42:36.666
what she's doing right now.

42:37.208 --> 42:40.625
We can't go back in her record
until we trace her chain of proxies.

42:41.041 --> 42:43.166
Concentrate. Find a clue.

42:43.500 --> 42:46.416
Just 'cause she doesn't use the recog,
doesn't stop us.

42:49.916 --> 42:53.375
Eclectic taste. A lot of
mid-century modern, high end.

42:54.125 --> 42:57.541
- Any read on the building?
- Loft. Downtown.

43:03.041 --> 43:06.291
Only way to locate her record is when
she's active in the Ether.

43:06.875 --> 43:08.708
Find the last proxy, we find her.

43:25.208 --> 43:26.541
Matches the perp's.

43:30.083 --> 43:32.583
Generally reload a gun
'cause you fired it.

43:42.041 --> 43:43.500
Mind's Eye's got nothing on it.

43:44.250 --> 43:46.583
I've got a feeling this girl
doesn't network.

44:04.958 --> 44:06.791
She's careful where she looks.

44:24.583 --> 44:26.000
She's in the Ether.

44:26.500 --> 44:28.333
How did she get past the protocols?

44:28.416 --> 44:30.041
Doesn't seem to be an issue.

44:30.125 --> 44:31.541
She's logging into a record.

44:33.250 --> 44:35.250
Whose eyes is she looking through?

44:36.458 --> 44:39.375
Jesper Nix, a stupid
money-leading art dealer.

44:39.458 --> 44:41.458
Two galleries on the Upper East Side.

44:48.625 --> 44:49.625
Who is he?

44:50.041 --> 44:51.708
Max Keener, 45.

44:52.416 --> 44:53.750
Known forger, priors.

44:55.458 --> 44:56.458
Paintings?

44:56.791 --> 44:58.416
I know what they're supposed to be.

45:05.625 --> 45:07.041
Naughty Jesper.

45:12.125 --> 45:14.500
She's getting rid of Jesper's meeting
with the forger.

45:25.625 --> 45:30.083
Replaces it with Jesper acting like he's
discovered these priceless works of art.

45:33.958 --> 45:36.083
My God, exquisite.

45:43.791 --> 45:44.833
She logged out already.

45:45.375 --> 45:46.375
You trace her?

45:47.416 --> 45:48.416
Twelve proxies.

45:49.250 --> 45:50.708
The last one's anonymous.

45:51.416 --> 45:53.500
Proxies hackers used to hide.

45:55.541 --> 45:57.458
Nice job, connecting the dots.

45:59.708 --> 46:00.708
Not 'til the end.

46:03.083 --> 46:05.500
- What's Nix doing now?
- "You live to tell the tale."

46:07.625 --> 46:10.083
Setting up appointments
to sell the fakes.

46:10.250 --> 46:12.208
- Keep tabs on him.
- Yes, sir.

46:12.291 --> 46:15.625
Let me know if our agoraphobe
goes out on the town.

47:21.125 --> 47:22.625
We watched her all night.

47:23.416 --> 47:25.416
We still don't have her location.

47:32.041 --> 47:33.500
Got to hand it to her.

47:35.125 --> 47:36.666
She really is analog.

48:11.833 --> 48:13.500
Wish she'd look out a window.

48:14.958 --> 48:15.958
Finally.

48:22.541 --> 48:23.583
Where'd she go?

48:24.208 --> 48:25.375
We lost her.

48:25.458 --> 48:27.083
The chain of proxies?

48:28.041 --> 48:29.250
She broke the links.

48:29.875 --> 48:30.958
Start a new chain.

48:31.666 --> 48:32.916
Common practice.

48:34.416 --> 48:35.416
Did she see us?

48:36.333 --> 48:37.333
No.

48:48.916 --> 48:51.875
At least we know she likes her eggs
sunny-side up.

48:55.708 --> 48:56.583
Sir.

48:56.666 --> 48:59.333
What's happened?
Nix sell one of his paintings?

48:59.458 --> 49:01.625
We don't have to worry
about that anymore, sir.

49:01.916 --> 49:02.916
Nix is dead.

49:03.416 --> 49:04.416
Same M.O.?

49:05.541 --> 49:06.625
Killer's POV.

49:19.666 --> 49:21.291
What do you want?

49:25.583 --> 49:27.583
Are you fucking crazy?!

49:30.458 --> 49:31.750
What do you want?

49:38.250 --> 49:39.416
What do you want?

49:40.583 --> 49:41.666
What do you want?

49:49.333 --> 49:51.666
They just posted from the crime scene.

49:58.333 --> 49:59.416
This case...

50:01.916 --> 50:03.750
it's become a priority for us.

50:06.333 --> 50:08.000
We understand, Commissioner.

50:09.083 --> 50:11.083
I don't know if you do, Detective.

50:13.958 --> 50:15.208
Five murders.

50:16.041 --> 50:17.291
It's not the murders.

50:20.875 --> 50:24.166
Sorry, Mr. Kenik.
This is a homicide case.

50:30.541 --> 50:33.291
This level of anonymizing

50:34.250 --> 50:36.458
makes all crime possible.

50:38.000 --> 50:40.083
It hinders our expansion to sub-crime.

50:43.333 --> 50:46.333
- Those lowlifes got what was coming...
- Victims.

50:48.083 --> 50:49.833
We're getting reports daily.

50:50.166 --> 50:52.083
Ghosts, ciphers...

50:52.166 --> 50:53.666
call them what you will.

50:53.875 --> 50:56.000
The integrity of the system
is compromised.

50:56.083 --> 50:57.375
The integrity?

51:00.458 --> 51:02.166
We rely on transparency.

51:02.916 --> 51:05.166
We can't control what we can't see.

51:05.833 --> 51:09.125
We require persistent identity.

51:10.500 --> 51:12.291
This isn't an isolated case.

51:13.166 --> 51:15.583
We believe there's a ring of individuals

51:15.875 --> 51:17.708
who may or may not know each other.

51:18.041 --> 51:22.041
They, like her, anonymize themselves
and others.

51:27.666 --> 51:29.041
I don't care

51:29.625 --> 51:31.666
the victims no longer exist.

51:34.166 --> 51:35.666
I care that she doesn't.

51:37.333 --> 51:40.000
In my mind, she's murdered herself.

51:42.083 --> 51:43.083
Oh, I see.

51:44.166 --> 51:46.208
Taking a life,
that's not important.

51:46.291 --> 51:47.958
Her not having one, that is?

51:48.041 --> 51:49.125
Yes.

51:51.208 --> 51:52.416
Now you understand.

52:07.500 --> 52:09.666
We need the first proxy in the new chain.

52:11.583 --> 52:13.250
You're going back under cover.

52:13.333 --> 52:17.041
Sitting in a police precinct
with the commissioner of police.

52:17.125 --> 52:20.750
I think that's the definition
of blowing my cover.

52:20.833 --> 52:22.583
It's only been three days.

52:23.125 --> 52:24.375
We put a patch over it.

52:24.458 --> 52:27.125
Make it look like you've been
in the brokerage house.

52:27.208 --> 52:29.458
If, like you say, she doesn't look back,

52:30.041 --> 52:31.041
she might go for it.

52:31.125 --> 52:32.166
Loyal customer.

52:32.250 --> 52:34.083
Maybe she does have a thing for you.

52:34.166 --> 52:37.083
Yeah, she's also got a thing
for blowing people's brains out.

52:37.166 --> 52:38.375
You heard what Kenik said.

52:38.458 --> 52:41.791
There's a fuck of a lot of commercial
interests at work here.

52:41.875 --> 52:43.541
Way above our pay grade.

52:45.750 --> 52:47.458
Anonymity is the enemy.

52:48.833 --> 52:51.041
We got to find out how she does it and...

52:52.791 --> 52:54.333
de-anonymize her.

52:55.458 --> 52:56.750
Same deal.

52:57.458 --> 53:00.208
We stay back, so she's not spooked.

53:00.791 --> 53:01.791
Gentlemen...

53:03.125 --> 53:04.750
when you make the patch...

53:05.416 --> 53:07.833
try to make it half as good as hers.

54:18.458 --> 54:21.125
You sure this isn't an excuse
to see me again?

54:22.416 --> 54:24.250
You don't like repeat business?

54:25.458 --> 54:26.916
Why haven't you done it?

54:27.541 --> 54:29.375
Waiting for a special occasion.

54:32.125 --> 54:33.875
Cut up some lines while I do this.

54:40.333 --> 54:42.250
I can replace the dealer with a hooker.

54:44.750 --> 54:46.750
- Dogs.
- I don't like dogs.

54:47.750 --> 54:48.833
Or nothing at all.

54:49.250 --> 54:52.083
You ever met anyone else
who can do what you do?

54:53.416 --> 54:54.875
Who doesn't exist?

54:55.958 --> 54:56.958
How could I?

55:37.000 --> 55:38.458
No need to do the dealer's side.

55:40.916 --> 55:42.500
He never laid eyes on you.

55:43.125 --> 55:45.125
I love those guys who do it blind.

55:49.416 --> 55:53.041
We close our eyes
to pray, cry, kiss, dream...

55:54.125 --> 55:55.125
or break the law.

55:59.041 --> 56:00.625
You can stay anonymous.

56:02.708 --> 56:04.291
It's just really fucking hard.

56:05.250 --> 56:07.708
You do this why? Pay the bills?

56:08.541 --> 56:09.541
Why else?

56:11.000 --> 56:13.416
You might have an agenda.

56:14.583 --> 56:16.125
You got the wrong girl.

56:17.541 --> 56:18.541
It's simple.

56:19.333 --> 56:21.666
They try to look, I try not to be seen.

56:23.458 --> 56:25.625
But if you're asking
if I think it's fucked up?

56:25.708 --> 56:27.125
Yeah, I think it's fucked up.

56:27.208 --> 56:29.166
They say it's for our safety.

56:29.750 --> 56:31.083
Why don't I feel safe?

56:36.250 --> 56:38.125
How long have you not existed?

56:39.625 --> 56:41.291
You ask a lot of questions.

56:41.375 --> 56:42.833
You don't answer them.

56:53.000 --> 56:54.041
Eighteen.

57:00.458 --> 57:02.208
Once in a lifetime chance.

57:03.375 --> 57:06.416
Started erasing.
I didn't stop until I was gone.

57:08.750 --> 57:10.833
In a lot of ways, it's the analog evidence

57:10.916 --> 57:13.083
that's harder to track down and destroy.

57:15.916 --> 57:16.958
DFE.

57:19.000 --> 57:20.750
Delete fucking everything.

57:23.750 --> 57:25.791
I never was happy in the big room.

57:26.041 --> 57:27.083
The big room?

57:27.166 --> 57:28.333
Outside world.

57:29.666 --> 57:30.666
Flesh space.

57:32.125 --> 57:34.833
Part of the planet
that's not cyberspace.

57:43.916 --> 57:45.333
You know that's illegal.

57:50.291 --> 57:52.416
You sure you have a girlfriend, Sol?

57:53.541 --> 57:55.541
You sure act like a single guy.

58:32.833 --> 58:35.041
Is there something else you'd like to do?

58:37.250 --> 58:38.500
That I can erase?

59:37.041 --> 59:38.750
Gotta make that disappear.

59:42.083 --> 59:43.875
Delete fucking everything.

59:45.125 --> 59:46.708
Especially the fucking.

59:49.916 --> 59:52.083
You really don't like to look back,
do you?

59:55.125 --> 59:56.125
Like you.

01:01:53.500 --> 01:01:56.500
Hello, Sal Frieland,
Detective First Class.

01:01:58.208 --> 01:01:59.458
What have you done?

01:01:59.833 --> 01:02:02.583
It's not that you don't like to look back,
you can't.

01:02:03.583 --> 01:02:05.541
Not without giving away
who you really are.

01:02:06.708 --> 01:02:07.958
He's fucking dead.

01:02:08.541 --> 01:02:10.125
You should've thought about that.

01:02:13.041 --> 01:02:14.333
Don't try to find me.

01:02:15.041 --> 01:02:16.583
Look and you are dead.

01:02:40.250 --> 01:02:41.500
You let her escape.

01:02:43.416 --> 01:02:45.291
And kill Lester on the way out.

01:02:48.416 --> 01:02:51.083
I don't know
if you can walk that back, Sal.

01:02:54.250 --> 01:02:55.791
She saw past our wall.

01:02:58.375 --> 01:02:59.625
Her own records.

01:03:06.083 --> 01:03:07.083
Go home.

01:03:09.750 --> 01:03:10.750
Take some time.

01:06:42.916 --> 01:06:43.916
I'm sorry.

01:06:47.333 --> 01:06:48.333
I'm sorry.

01:06:51.458 --> 01:06:52.458
I'm sorry.

01:06:55.041 --> 01:06:57.666
I took my eyes off him for a second.

01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:13.125
One second.

01:07:14.041 --> 01:07:15.458
Yeah, that was him.

01:09:12.666 --> 01:09:14.291
- Kristen.
- Hi, Sal.

01:09:15.125 --> 01:09:17.291
Send me your memories of Salvador.

01:09:18.082 --> 01:09:19.082
What?

01:09:19.707 --> 01:09:20.707
No.

01:09:21.207 --> 01:09:23.375
I don't want to go back to there.
It hurts.

01:09:23.457 --> 01:09:26.041
Look, please, just send me a picture.
Anything.

01:09:26.791 --> 01:09:28.000
Why? What for?

01:09:28.832 --> 01:09:29.832
Mine are gone.

01:09:30.500 --> 01:09:31.500
Gone?

01:09:34.832 --> 01:09:35.832
Okay.

01:09:41.416 --> 01:09:42.457
Shit.

01:09:44.707 --> 01:09:45.832
Sal, he's gone.

01:09:49.041 --> 01:09:50.041
He's gone.

01:09:52.332 --> 01:09:54.041
What the fuck is happening?

01:09:55.166 --> 01:09:56.166
Sal?

01:09:57.541 --> 01:09:58.541
Sal?

01:10:28.416 --> 01:10:29.416
Sal.

01:10:30.291 --> 01:10:31.291
Sal?

01:10:34.166 --> 01:10:35.166
It's Thomas.

01:10:40.333 --> 01:10:41.333
Thomas DeVry.

01:11:32.041 --> 01:11:35.541
Intersection in 30 meters.
Apply brake.

01:11:35.625 --> 01:11:37.208
Please, stop now.

01:11:40.208 --> 01:11:42.458
Check your surroundings for safety.

01:11:49.875 --> 01:11:51.875
All clear. Please proceed.

01:11:59.916 --> 01:12:02.083
I told you to take some time, Sal.

01:12:02.750 --> 01:12:03.750
Leave it alone.

01:12:03.833 --> 01:12:05.375
She won't leave me alone.

01:12:05.541 --> 01:12:07.041
She keeps jacking my eye.

01:12:10.416 --> 01:12:12.041
I don't know what I'm looking at.

01:12:14.791 --> 01:12:16.708
"I can't believe my eyes"...

01:12:17.541 --> 01:12:18.958
is not an expression.

01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:23.250
I'm scared to sleep.

01:12:24.208 --> 01:12:26.166
Can't hide. She knows where I am.

01:12:28.416 --> 01:12:29.416
Everything.

01:12:32.958 --> 01:12:34.375
My son, Salvador...

01:12:38.833 --> 01:12:40.625
all the good memories, gone.

01:12:44.125 --> 01:12:45.166
What happened?

01:12:51.333 --> 01:12:53.750
She makes me watch it over
and over again.

01:12:55.750 --> 01:12:57.125
Sure you're not seeing things?

01:12:57.208 --> 01:13:02.041
Of course I'm fucking seeing things.
That's the whole point.

01:13:04.625 --> 01:13:06.166
We're hiring more hackers.

01:13:06.833 --> 01:13:07.875
Like her.

01:13:08.583 --> 01:13:10.291
What else are we going to do?

01:13:11.041 --> 01:13:12.250
It's what you said.

01:13:13.208 --> 01:13:16.125
Everything's connected,
everything's vulnerable.

01:13:17.791 --> 01:13:18.791
Shit.

01:13:19.500 --> 01:13:21.750
Stopped taking calls
from the commissioner.

01:13:21.833 --> 01:13:23.666
We watch, they don't watch us.

01:13:24.833 --> 01:13:26.791
We know where they are, we're invisible.

01:13:30.333 --> 01:13:32.166
How do I stop it Charlie?

01:13:33.041 --> 01:13:34.125
You find her...

01:13:34.875 --> 01:13:35.875
it stops.

01:13:38.041 --> 01:13:39.416
I wish Lester was here.

01:13:40.833 --> 01:13:42.125
Alert in the Ether.

01:13:43.041 --> 01:13:44.833
Warrant for Detective Frieland.

01:13:45.750 --> 01:13:47.666
In the shooting of Thomas DeVry.

01:13:51.875 --> 01:13:53.625
He lives in my building. My neighbor.

01:14:03.083 --> 01:14:05.625
I fired the gun. I didn't shoot him.

01:14:05.708 --> 01:14:07.583
It sure as hell looks like you did.

01:14:07.666 --> 01:14:10.375
No one ever tell you that
looks can be deceiving?

01:14:10.458 --> 01:14:13.250
Slug from your nine millimeter
found in the wall...

01:14:13.333 --> 01:14:14.750
ballistics points to you.

01:14:14.833 --> 01:14:16.416
Have you seen the autopsy?

01:14:18.666 --> 01:14:21.333
A nine millimeter doesn't make a hole
in you like that.

01:14:21.833 --> 01:14:23.250
Inconclusive, says here.

01:14:23.333 --> 01:14:27.125
It's a construction manipulated,
made up. It's fake.

01:14:27.625 --> 01:14:30.541
There's no evidence that it's fraudulent.

01:14:30.625 --> 01:14:32.791
And there's no evidence to say it's real.

01:14:34.625 --> 01:14:37.541
We can't assume
everything is counterfeit.

01:14:38.875 --> 01:14:40.541
We have to believe our eyes

01:14:40.958 --> 01:14:42.750
or the system doesn't work.

01:14:42.833 --> 01:14:43.875
It's her.

01:14:43.958 --> 01:14:47.166
She's trying to fuck with me.
She wants me off the case.

01:14:48.541 --> 01:14:49.625
She got her wish.

01:14:52.833 --> 01:14:55.416
You're suspended,
pending an investigation.

01:14:56.250 --> 01:14:57.333
House arrest.

01:14:58.208 --> 01:15:00.583
Surveillance around the clock.

01:15:29.708 --> 01:15:30.875
Feels strange, sir.

01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:33.000
Watching you.

01:15:33.416 --> 01:15:34.583
Then don't.

01:18:58.458 --> 01:18:59.958
You really are a cop.

01:19:01.625 --> 01:19:05.458
When you all hacked my eye,
everyone was looking at me.

01:19:05.541 --> 01:19:07.541
You can be distracting.

01:19:09.583 --> 01:19:10.833
You remembered?

01:19:13.125 --> 01:19:15.291
There was something else
in the reflection.

01:19:18.333 --> 01:19:19.458
Stay where you are.

01:19:20.125 --> 01:19:21.666
Put the gun down, Sal.

01:19:22.166 --> 01:19:24.291
Won't do you any good.
I can see what you see.

01:19:29.250 --> 01:19:32.041
I would show you around,
but you've already seen the place.

01:19:34.333 --> 01:19:35.333
How was it?

01:19:36.541 --> 01:19:38.458
Did you all like what you saw?

01:19:39.750 --> 01:19:41.458
You're gonna show yourself?

01:19:42.041 --> 01:19:43.875
Makes too much work for me.

01:19:45.458 --> 01:19:46.458
Why?

01:19:48.500 --> 01:19:50.500
Why are you doing this to me?

01:19:51.708 --> 01:19:53.166
I can't take the credit.

01:19:54.041 --> 01:19:57.416
Someone is killing my customers,
trying to make it look like it's me.

01:19:58.041 --> 01:19:59.166
I can't tell.

01:20:00.250 --> 01:20:02.125
I want to show you something.

01:20:05.208 --> 01:20:06.208
My record.

01:20:07.541 --> 01:20:09.125
Time of the murders.

01:20:09.666 --> 01:20:10.708
Lester.

01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:37.083
Someone made it look like I did it.

01:20:38.125 --> 01:20:40.125
Are you saying the hacker got hacked?

01:20:40.833 --> 01:20:44.333
They could be watching through
our eyes right now. Yours, mine.

01:20:45.875 --> 01:20:47.541
I'm not safe anywhere.

01:20:48.291 --> 01:20:49.291
Neither are you.

01:20:50.125 --> 01:20:52.291
You're the last one I was with
who's alive.

01:20:54.875 --> 01:20:56.750
How do I know you're not lying?

01:20:57.750 --> 01:21:01.875
How do I know that what you just showed me
is your actual record?

01:21:02.708 --> 01:21:03.708
You don't.

01:21:15.875 --> 01:21:18.833
What part of "suspended"
do you not understand?

01:21:19.500 --> 01:21:20.750
You jammed your meta.

01:21:20.958 --> 01:21:22.375
Assaulted a fellow officer.

01:21:22.875 --> 01:21:26.166
Charlie, the other DNA
that we couldn't identify,

01:21:26.625 --> 01:21:28.333
maybe it's not degraded.

01:21:29.833 --> 01:21:31.291
Maybe it's unregistered.

01:21:32.625 --> 01:21:33.625
Another cipher.

01:21:33.666 --> 01:21:35.500
Or maybe it's degraded.

01:21:35.875 --> 01:21:38.791
She showed me her record
when Lester was killed.

01:21:40.541 --> 01:21:42.291
She's not there when the shot's fired.

01:21:42.375 --> 01:21:44.000
Well, where is she now?

01:21:44.333 --> 01:21:46.291
You've obviously held her for questioning.

01:21:50.500 --> 01:21:51.958
I don't think it's her.

01:21:52.041 --> 01:21:53.083
Why?

01:21:53.375 --> 01:21:54.500
'Cause you fucked her?

01:21:56.958 --> 01:22:00.208
Her alibi could be fabricated
like all of her hacks.

01:22:00.291 --> 01:22:01.291
Proves nothing.

01:22:01.333 --> 01:22:04.208
That's the problem,
that nothing proves anything.

01:22:05.291 --> 01:22:07.666
She's playing you, Sal.

01:22:09.416 --> 01:22:14.000
You're officially relieved of all duty,
pending a departmental hearing.

01:22:14.625 --> 01:22:17.208
All access privileges rescinded.

01:22:20.333 --> 01:22:21.666
We're watching you.

01:22:23.333 --> 01:22:24.916
You should thank us.

01:22:46.166 --> 01:22:47.291
What's he doing?

01:22:48.750 --> 01:22:50.166
Whole lot of nothing.

01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:04.833
All units respond.

01:24:43.250 --> 01:24:44.250
Damn it.

01:24:44.416 --> 01:24:45.750
Why'd you do that?

01:24:56.125 --> 01:24:57.166
I fell for it.

01:24:58.708 --> 01:25:01.291
Looking through his eyes,
I forgot to look through yours.

01:25:01.708 --> 01:25:03.666
Well, now you can both look through mine.

01:25:08.666 --> 01:25:09.666
Why?

01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:11.125
Why'd you do this?

01:25:13.750 --> 01:25:14.791
It was perfect.

01:25:16.916 --> 01:25:18.416
We were never meant to meet.

01:25:18.875 --> 01:25:20.041
Who are you?

01:25:20.625 --> 01:25:22.083
I know who you are.

01:25:23.916 --> 01:25:25.291
You found me in the Ether?

01:25:25.375 --> 01:25:28.083
No. No, you found me.

01:25:29.041 --> 01:25:30.916
You're the anonymous proxy?

01:25:31.708 --> 01:25:33.333
The last one in the chain.

01:25:33.791 --> 01:25:35.083
You kept me safe.

01:25:35.750 --> 01:25:38.166
They hired me to lead them to you.

01:25:38.750 --> 01:25:40.083
I led them away.

01:25:41.875 --> 01:25:43.208
You've seen my record.

01:25:43.583 --> 01:25:44.791
You know how I hide.

01:25:44.875 --> 01:25:46.625
The algorithm is brilliant.

01:25:47.083 --> 01:25:48.125
Really.

01:25:49.250 --> 01:25:51.708
I know how bad you want to disappear.

01:25:53.708 --> 01:25:55.208
You erase records...

01:25:55.958 --> 01:25:57.958
but you can't erase memories.

01:26:00.458 --> 01:26:01.458
I can.

01:26:02.416 --> 01:26:03.416
No.

01:26:04.416 --> 01:26:07.541
We can hack this out,
like it didn't happen.

01:26:07.708 --> 01:26:08.958
You can disappear.

01:26:09.416 --> 01:26:10.416
We can.

01:26:15.791 --> 01:26:16.791
No.

01:26:18.708 --> 01:26:19.916
It's different now.

01:26:24.333 --> 01:26:26.625
Why did you make it look like it was me?

01:26:29.416 --> 01:26:30.500
We're together.

01:27:49.541 --> 01:27:51.166
His record's gone.

01:27:55.750 --> 01:27:58.708
You have no idea who this Cyrus Frear was?

01:27:59.125 --> 01:28:00.833
He fucking worked for you.

01:28:03.916 --> 01:28:05.541
You recommended him.

01:28:06.583 --> 01:28:07.583
I did?

01:28:09.125 --> 01:28:10.125
Yes.

01:28:11.625 --> 01:28:13.500
He made it look like I did.

01:28:19.375 --> 01:28:20.375
The girl?

01:28:23.125 --> 01:28:24.125
Where is she?

01:28:26.250 --> 01:28:27.625
Who is she?

01:28:29.541 --> 01:28:31.291
Aren't you going to look?

01:29:09.916 --> 01:29:10.916
Look at me.

01:29:16.000 --> 01:29:17.083
I'm sorry.

01:29:18.625 --> 01:29:21.000
No way to warn you without him knowing.

01:29:21.750 --> 01:29:24.541
Only way to find him
was to let him find you.

01:29:25.708 --> 01:29:27.583
You got to work on your timing.

01:29:28.333 --> 01:29:29.500
Cut it close.

01:29:32.458 --> 01:29:34.083
So we found you.

01:29:35.041 --> 01:29:36.041
Your life.

01:29:37.541 --> 01:29:38.875
That was the beginning.

01:29:40.041 --> 01:29:41.291
Anyone I was with.

01:29:45.250 --> 01:29:46.916
He didn't want me like that.

01:29:49.166 --> 01:29:51.458
So no one else could have me either.

01:29:52.916 --> 01:29:55.375
Don't suppose you're going to tell me
how you do it.

01:29:56.500 --> 01:29:58.291
How you disappear.

01:29:59.333 --> 01:30:01.958
It's there for anyone to see
if you know where to look.

01:30:04.458 --> 01:30:06.083
You have my record already.

01:30:08.708 --> 01:30:09.708
They do.

01:30:13.166 --> 01:30:14.583
I gave it to all of you.

01:30:17.041 --> 01:30:18.083
The algorithm.

01:30:19.541 --> 01:30:21.791
Breaks my life up
into fractions of seconds

01:30:21.875 --> 01:30:24.541
and randomly stores them
in the records of everyone else.

01:30:25.416 --> 01:30:28.166
But if you try to find
that split second of me,

01:30:29.041 --> 01:30:30.666
it would go by without you knowing.

01:30:33.166 --> 01:30:37.000
You have to have the algorithm
to put my entire life back together.

01:30:38.250 --> 01:30:39.791
If you want to look back.

01:30:43.833 --> 01:30:47.583
Any charges, I'll make it all go away
before you do.

01:30:48.625 --> 01:30:50.791
You invade my privacy, it's nothing.

01:30:50.875 --> 01:30:52.833
I try to get it back, it's a crime.

01:30:54.291 --> 01:30:55.375
Don't you get it?

01:30:56.541 --> 01:30:59.125
The more you try to hide,
the more attention you attract.

01:30:59.833 --> 01:31:02.583
Why is it so important
that nobody knows you?

01:31:04.416 --> 01:31:07.750
You get rid of other people's secrets.
What's yours?

01:31:08.916 --> 01:31:10.750
Does there have to be one?

01:31:12.000 --> 01:31:14.291
Everyone has something to hide.

01:31:15.583 --> 01:31:16.791
That's what you do.

01:31:18.833 --> 01:31:21.250
What you look for every day of your life.

01:31:22.125 --> 01:31:23.583
Why you'll never understand.

01:31:27.541 --> 01:31:29.875
It's not that I have something to hide...

01:31:32.541 --> 01:31:34.500
I have nothing I want you to see.
