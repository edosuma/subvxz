WEBVTT

00:19.487 --> 00:21.053
Katie!

00:21.055 --> 00:22.388
( Screams )

00:22.390 --> 00:25.424
No! Oh, my god!

00:36.804 --> 00:38.704
( Panting )

00:54.555 --> 00:56.488
All right, there, miss.
All right.

00:56.490 --> 00:57.623
Whoa!

00:59.093 --> 01:00.626
Please, he's gonna kill them.

01:00.628 --> 01:02.127
She's covered in blood.

01:02.129 --> 01:04.696
Is someone chasing you?
Is someone out there?

01:04.697 --> 01:06.198
It's that house.

01:06.200 --> 01:08.367
There's something
horrible in that house.

01:18.446 --> 01:21.447
Deep breaths.
Deep breaths.

01:21.449 --> 01:24.283
Slow. Just tell us
what happened.

01:24.285 --> 01:25.517
What's your name?

01:25.519 --> 01:27.286
Bender.
My name's Kate bender.

01:27.288 --> 01:28.654
Katie.

01:28.656 --> 01:30.589
My, my friends,
we were hiking, you know?

01:30.591 --> 01:34.860
And, and we found this house in
the woods about a mile that way.

01:34.862 --> 01:37.162
Oh, god!
Oh, god!

01:37.164 --> 01:38.430
Okay, just breathe.

01:38.432 --> 01:39.832
Take a deep breath, Katie.

01:39.834 --> 01:43.368
- ( Whimpers )
- Good. Good.

01:43.370 --> 01:46.405
Katie, someone was in the house?

01:46.407 --> 01:49.208
He, he was in there
and he has my friends.

01:49.210 --> 01:51.343
He has Mathias and
Sarah and James!

01:51.345 --> 01:52.811
don't worry about
that right now. Who is he?

01:52.813 --> 01:54.746
I don't know.
A man.

01:54.748 --> 01:56.215
I never got a good look
but I have to go back.

01:56.217 --> 01:57.616
I have to save them!

01:57.618 --> 01:58.750
Look at me, look at me.
Look at me.

01:58.752 --> 02:00.352
All right?
Take a drink of this,

02:00.354 --> 02:04.256
just calm down.
Take a sip. There you go.

02:04.258 --> 02:07.259
We're not gonna let you go
back in the house by yourself.

02:09.430 --> 02:11.163
Right?

02:14.235 --> 02:17.669
All right. Bloody girl in the
forest, a killer in the house.

02:17.671 --> 02:19.571
Who says we go back to Prague?

02:19.573 --> 02:21.340
I left a lovely bird
back in that nightclub.

02:21.342 --> 02:23.842
This is me, ignoring you.
Get used to it.

02:23.844 --> 02:26.211
( Beeping )

02:26.213 --> 02:27.846
Is that a good beeping
or a bad beeping?

02:27.848 --> 02:30.282
It means we found the broken
ley lines we were looking for.

02:30.284 --> 02:33.519
Multi-dimensional maps,
don't look at them unless

02:33.521 --> 02:35.921
you can do the math to
sort out the magic layers.

02:35.923 --> 02:37.589
And you like headaches
and nosebleeds.

02:37.591 --> 02:39.358
Are you all right?

02:39.360 --> 02:40.592
Mm-hmm.

02:40.594 --> 02:41.693
Is it the tumor?

02:41.695 --> 02:43.162
It's always the tumor.

02:43.164 --> 02:44.696
I'm fine.

02:44.698 --> 02:46.765
The vertices used
to be static and

02:46.767 --> 02:50.936
now they're--
now they're wavy.

02:50.938 --> 02:55.707
Moving and when they stop,
I can see them.

02:55.709 --> 02:58.243
Math girl's doing
one of her loopy-loops.

02:58.245 --> 03:01.413
don't-- don't call
me "math girl."

03:01.415 --> 03:03.749
Mr. Jenkins said we needed
to find the broken ley lines

03:03.751 --> 03:07.653
and I say they are that way.

03:07.655 --> 03:12.891
Ah. Where the blood-covered
girl came from.

03:12.893 --> 03:16.528
Anybody here like
that coincidence?

03:16.530 --> 03:18.463
I hate that coincidence!

03:18.465 --> 03:20.933
No, hold on,
I'm gonna put you on speaker.

03:22.603 --> 03:25.304
Now, colonel, broken
ley lines are never good.

03:25.306 --> 03:27.839
And with the return of magic
they're even more dangerous.

03:27.841 --> 03:30.309
If you don't anchor them,
they could build up

03:30.311 --> 03:32.578
enough charge and explode
all over Slovakia.

03:32.580 --> 03:35.214
Cassandra says those lines
are stable for now.

03:35.216 --> 03:37.716
They're all sort of converged
about a mile northeast

03:37.718 --> 03:40.319
which is roughly where
this house is supposed to be.

03:40.321 --> 03:42.421
The house and the broken
lines are in the same place?

03:42.423 --> 03:43.956
We're about to find out.

03:43.958 --> 03:46.358
And you say there was
violence in this house.

03:46.360 --> 03:47.626
Anyone killed?

03:47.628 --> 03:49.895
Unknown. Possible.

03:49.897 --> 03:52.364
Likely.

03:52.366 --> 03:54.299
Broken ley lines
means wild magic.

03:54.301 --> 03:57.502
We may now be looking
at a haunting, colonel.

03:57.504 --> 04:00.672
A very new, very powerful
haunting.

04:00.674 --> 04:04.643
Angry spirits mixed with
wild magic from the ley lines.

04:04.645 --> 04:06.545
Not good.

04:15.022 --> 04:18.890
These are magic anchor
scrolls from zou yan.

04:18.892 --> 04:21.360
Activate one at each
of the cardinal directions,

04:21.362 --> 04:22.861
north, south, east, west.

04:22.863 --> 04:24.696
It should anchor the energies.

04:24.698 --> 04:26.531
Stop them from building.

04:26.533 --> 04:29.368
Stone, you and I take point,
look for Katie's friends.

04:29.370 --> 04:31.336
Jones, you activate
the anchor scrolls.

04:31.338 --> 04:33.472
With any luck we can kill
both these birds at once.

04:33.474 --> 04:35.540
- Hey!
- Cassandra, you stay with her.

04:35.542 --> 04:37.709
There are four lines to anchor.
I can help.

04:37.711 --> 04:40.012
I vote she does all
of them, I'll stay here.

04:40.014 --> 04:41.713
We just don't know what's
up there and you're not--

04:41.715 --> 04:45.851
what?
I'm not what?

04:45.853 --> 04:46.952
Look, you did your
part with the maps.

04:46.954 --> 04:48.553
Cassandra, she's half in shock.

04:48.555 --> 04:50.656
She can't be left alone.

04:50.658 --> 04:53.825
Okay, but we need to talk
about my part when this--

05:15.849 --> 05:18.317
what's with the face?

05:18.319 --> 05:21.019
More than nervous,
less than terror.

05:21.021 --> 05:23.989
Still ignoring you.
I meant stone.

05:23.991 --> 05:28.960
This is a 19th-century
American frontier house.

05:28.962 --> 05:32.497
What the hell is it doing in
the middle of slovakian forest?

05:32.499 --> 05:34.866
Seriously?

05:34.868 --> 05:37.069
I'm just saying it
doesn't belong here.

05:40.841 --> 05:42.107
All right.

05:42.109 --> 05:45.811
We clear a room,
you set the anchor.

06:17.411 --> 06:18.977
South anchor set.

06:18.979 --> 06:20.479
Clear.

06:23.817 --> 06:25.117
Clear.

06:55.182 --> 06:58.049
( Rumbling )

07:03.724 --> 07:06.725
- North anchor set.
- ( Rattling )

07:28.849 --> 07:31.116
Out! Out!
Everybody out!

07:46.533 --> 07:49.634
Who are you people?

07:49.636 --> 07:52.871
Librarians.

07:52.873 --> 07:54.473
We're the librarians.

07:59.646 --> 08:01.980
What kind of librarian
carries a gun?

08:01.982 --> 08:06.985
Uh, we do field, um,
like, library research.

08:06.987 --> 08:10.222
Stuff, it gets dangerous.

08:10.224 --> 08:12.524
You're very weird librarians.

08:12.526 --> 08:14.693
It's a very weird library.

08:14.695 --> 08:16.628
All right. It's done.

08:16.630 --> 08:17.996
The last anchor.

08:17.998 --> 08:18.997
- Are we good?
- We're good.

08:18.999 --> 08:20.665
All right. We're on.

08:20.667 --> 08:22.934
Katie, we're going back in
for your friends.

08:22.936 --> 08:24.569
Finally, all we have
to do is just go--

08:24.571 --> 08:26.171
no, we're going.

08:26.173 --> 08:28.039
You're staying here
with Cassandra.

08:28.041 --> 08:30.141
What? You can't just leave me here.
They're my friends.

08:30.143 --> 08:32.177
Listen, it's fine.
There's three of us.

08:32.179 --> 08:33.645
I think we can take one psycho.

08:33.647 --> 08:35.780
Well, two and a half
with Jones, but still--

08:35.782 --> 08:38.183
you see I'm standing right
here where I can hear you.

08:38.184 --> 08:40.217
Why am I being sidelined?

08:40.220 --> 08:42.687
Cassandra, no one's
being sidelined.

08:42.688 --> 08:44.689
Right now, I'm allocating
resources as needed,

08:44.691 --> 08:46.658
I need you to look after Katie,

08:46.660 --> 08:48.927
who is currently--
running back up there.

08:48.929 --> 08:50.829
Damn it, Katie! Stop!

08:55.802 --> 08:58.737
Mathias?

09:00.207 --> 09:03.808
Sarah?
It's me.

09:03.810 --> 09:05.777
James!

09:08.882 --> 09:10.115
( Muffled yell )

09:14.988 --> 09:16.221
( Footsteps thumping )

09:26.967 --> 09:28.567
We know you're up there.
We know you can hear us.

09:28.569 --> 09:30.702
This can go one of two ways.

09:30.704 --> 09:32.304
You come down,
we get these people help,

09:32.306 --> 09:36.741
nobody gets hurt.
Or, we come up.

09:36.743 --> 09:39.611
Fine. It's the hard way.

09:39.613 --> 09:41.913
You two, you stay down here.

09:41.915 --> 09:44.749
Cassandra, I mean it.

09:44.751 --> 09:46.084
Jones.

09:51.158 --> 09:55.160
So, all you do is read maps?

10:06.607 --> 10:09.174
Wait, wait.

10:09.176 --> 10:12.043
These dimensions are wrong.

10:13.880 --> 10:16.848
Does this hall
extend past the house?

10:18.752 --> 10:21.886
- Oh, no.
- Shh!

10:21.888 --> 10:24.155
This is a sign, mate--

10:24.157 --> 10:26.191
"keep off
the bloody grass."

10:26.193 --> 10:27.826
He's up here somewhere.

10:27.828 --> 10:30.996
We clear these rooms
by the numbers.

10:30.998 --> 10:32.731
All right.

10:32.733 --> 10:35.100
This is exactly the point in
the movie where the guy

10:35.102 --> 10:37.302
in the audience says,
"get the hell out!"

10:37.304 --> 10:38.803
Go. Do you want
the first room?

10:38.805 --> 10:41.106
- don't be stupid.
- I got the second one.

10:41.108 --> 10:43.875
Far corner's mine.

10:46.980 --> 10:48.747
( Clatter )

11:02.663 --> 11:06.998
Umberto classic, 1869.
Nice.

11:07.000 --> 11:07.966
( Piano notes )

11:09.936 --> 11:12.804
Why does nobody listen
to the guy in the movies?

11:12.806 --> 11:15.140
Movie guy is always right.

11:38.265 --> 11:41.332
That is not creepy at all.

11:53.113 --> 11:55.313
This house.

12:00.320 --> 12:02.754
Crate hammer?

12:20.741 --> 12:23.208
( Door creaks )

12:24.244 --> 12:26.878
( Sighs )

12:33.086 --> 12:35.320
Movie guy is wrong.

12:35.322 --> 12:37.155
Movie guy is wrong.

12:37.157 --> 12:38.356
Movie guy is wrong.

12:40.527 --> 12:42.861
( Exhales )

12:50.003 --> 12:51.136
Baird! Where are you?

12:51.138 --> 12:53.972
Stone.

12:55.475 --> 12:57.842
( Screaming )

13:04.351 --> 13:06.551
Whoa, whoa!

13:11.057 --> 13:12.257
Come on, man.

13:12.259 --> 13:14.025
( Exhales )

13:19.966 --> 13:21.833
I didn't hear anything.

13:21.835 --> 13:24.068
I didn't see any kids
and they sure as hell

13:24.070 --> 13:25.403
didn't get past me and Jones.

13:25.405 --> 13:26.404
Why would they?

13:26.406 --> 13:27.806
I'm just saying what I saw.

13:27.808 --> 13:29.207
A white girl
about 18-years-old.

13:29.209 --> 13:30.508
That's Sarah.

13:30.510 --> 13:32.510
And two boys,
one black, one white.

13:32.512 --> 13:34.279
That's James and Mathias.
You saw them?

13:34.281 --> 13:36.281
I don't know what I saw.

13:36.283 --> 13:38.516
Oh, my god.
That's their clothes!

13:38.518 --> 13:39.584
They're, they're dead,
aren't they?

13:39.586 --> 13:41.319
They're all dead!

13:41.321 --> 13:42.954
I said I don't know,
I don't know, honey--

13:42.956 --> 13:44.389
you said it was gonna be okay.

13:44.391 --> 13:46.124
You said you'd
get them out of this house!

13:46.126 --> 13:48.259
Katie! Katie, wait!

13:51.531 --> 13:53.431
So I'm the Katie wrangler now?

13:53.433 --> 13:55.099
Fine.

13:57.070 --> 13:58.469
All right.

13:58.471 --> 14:00.471
This is just the ley lines
going nuts, right?

14:00.473 --> 14:01.973
I thought the point
of the scrolls

14:01.975 --> 14:02.974
was to shut these things down.

14:02.976 --> 14:04.309
I don't know.

14:04.311 --> 14:08.213
But I bet there's
someone who does.

14:08.215 --> 14:10.381
Jenkins, quick question.

14:10.383 --> 14:14.519
Could anchoring the ley lines in a
haunted house jumpstart the ghosts?

14:14.521 --> 14:16.988
You know, colonel,
you have an incredible talent

14:16.990 --> 14:20.525
for turning a bad situation
into a worst-case scenario.

14:20.527 --> 14:22.160
Could you table
the snark for five seconds?

14:22.162 --> 14:23.595
We have a situation.

14:23.597 --> 14:25.530
Yes, yes, I am aware of
your situation

14:25.532 --> 14:27.565
and in deference to that,
I am going to boil this down

14:27.567 --> 14:30.635
to a classic
good news/bad news paradigm.

14:30.637 --> 14:32.337
- Jenkins--
- yes, fine.

14:32.339 --> 14:34.906
Good news is that
you've successfully secured

14:34.908 --> 14:39.377
the broken ley lines so there
will be no magical cataclysm.

14:39.379 --> 14:40.612
Huzzah.

14:40.614 --> 14:43.081
The house, Jenkins,
what about the house?

14:43.083 --> 14:47.518
Uh, yes, the house.

14:47.520 --> 14:50.455
Well.
Uh, the bad news.

14:50.457 --> 14:52.957
Have you ever heard the story of
the house on the haunted hill

14:52.959 --> 14:55.126
where a group of
paranormal researchers

14:55.128 --> 14:57.362
died in madness and terror?

14:57.364 --> 14:59.931
Or the one where
the psychotic killed

14:59.933 --> 15:02.200
a whole sorority one Halloween?

15:02.202 --> 15:04.402
Those are just stories.
Urban legends.

15:04.404 --> 15:07.138
Yeah, different stories.

15:07.140 --> 15:08.573
Same house.

15:08.575 --> 15:11.075
And you're standing in it.

15:22.022 --> 15:25.189
Now, according to
the heisserer index,

15:25.191 --> 15:29.928
there are six mystery houses.

15:29.930 --> 15:32.163
Yes, the ur adobe.

15:32.165 --> 15:33.398
The dionaea house.

15:33.400 --> 15:35.633
The shatterbox.
The final rest.

15:35.635 --> 15:38.937
The house of refuge,
then there is the soul cage.

15:38.939 --> 15:41.539
I think you've stumbled
into either the box

15:41.541 --> 15:43.374
or just possibly the cage.

15:43.376 --> 15:45.443
You know, there's some argument
about the methodology of--

15:45.445 --> 15:47.612
whoa, whoa, whoa!
Jenkins!

15:47.614 --> 15:50.715
Right. So all reports of
the house of refuge

15:50.717 --> 15:54.285
describe it
as benign, even helpful.

15:54.287 --> 15:57.655
The final rest was
destroyed in 1350.

16:00.994 --> 16:03.394
You're in the shatterbox.

16:03.396 --> 16:05.296
Salute!

16:05.298 --> 16:07.198
You're the first librarians
to step foot in the place.

16:07.200 --> 16:08.666
It has a tendency
to move around.

16:08.668 --> 16:11.135
What do you mean
it moves around?

16:11.137 --> 16:14.505
It appears somewhere, it takes
victims and then moves on.

16:14.507 --> 16:17.408
Men, women, boys,
girls, families.

16:17.410 --> 16:20.645
Ironically, no sororities yet.

16:20.647 --> 16:24.248
But then, it feeds and moves on.

16:24.250 --> 16:26.017
Moves on to where?

16:26.019 --> 16:28.219
The next dining location,
I take it.

16:28.221 --> 16:30.688
I mean, we've known it's been doing
this for at least a century.

16:30.690 --> 16:34.492
First confirmed sighting
was 1883 when a woman

16:34.494 --> 16:36.094
named Abigail munson--

16:36.096 --> 16:38.363
I don't need the whole
real estate ad from hell,

16:38.365 --> 16:40.031
just tell me how to get
Katie's friends out of here.

16:40.033 --> 16:42.266
Well, you don't.

16:42.268 --> 16:44.669
Once the house
takes victims, that's it.

16:44.671 --> 16:47.505
You might be able to stop it.

16:47.507 --> 16:50.008
Stop it from moving on
and taking more victims.

16:50.010 --> 16:53.277
Just find the dark heart
of the house and destroy it.

16:53.279 --> 16:56.280
Where is this dark heart?
What does it look like?

16:56.282 --> 16:59.083
Uh, well, that's the rub.
It could be anything.

16:59.085 --> 17:01.719
An expensive vase.
A rug. A mouse.

17:01.721 --> 17:03.654
You'll know it when you see it

17:03.656 --> 17:06.223
but you only have 'til midnight.

17:06.226 --> 17:09.426
Got it. Got it.

17:09.429 --> 17:11.194
Okay.

17:11.196 --> 17:13.431
( Sighs )

17:13.433 --> 17:15.299
So, there's no monster
in the house.

17:15.300 --> 17:17.101
The house is the monster.

17:17.103 --> 17:19.604
And we have until midnight
to find its "dark heart"

17:19.606 --> 17:22.573
and destroy it before it goes
off in search of more victims.

17:22.575 --> 17:24.709
Why is it always midnight?

17:24.711 --> 17:26.644
- Who makes these rules?
- I don't know.

17:26.646 --> 17:29.347
Have either of you seen
anything out of the ordinary?

17:29.349 --> 17:32.116
I saw a metal crate hammer

17:32.118 --> 17:36.354
from, like, the 1800s,
caked in blood.

17:36.356 --> 17:39.824
Or how about the pram
from "Rosemary's baby"?

17:39.826 --> 17:41.526
No, seriously.
It's up there.

17:41.528 --> 17:45.463
Never mind.
Just-- just go. Carefully.

17:50.336 --> 17:52.236
I think you're gonna
want to hear this--

17:53.506 --> 17:56.140
nobody was here.

17:56.142 --> 17:58.076
We thought it was abandoned.

17:58.078 --> 17:59.811
We thought we'd
just spend the night

17:59.813 --> 18:01.546
and then move on in the morning.

18:01.548 --> 18:06.551
Then he came.

18:06.553 --> 18:08.453
It was horrible.

18:08.455 --> 18:10.321
He's like a shadow
and he has this thing

18:10.323 --> 18:12.457
like a hammer
or a hatchet--

18:12.459 --> 18:14.092
what do you mean, like a shadow?

18:14.094 --> 18:17.662
Like...
Like smoke.

18:17.664 --> 18:19.831
Like he's made out of smoke.

18:19.833 --> 18:24.702
Why didn't you
tell us this before?

18:24.704 --> 18:26.571
You would have
thought I was crazy.

18:26.573 --> 18:31.275
Things like that don't
just happen, do they?

18:31.277 --> 18:33.478
They actually happen
more than you think.

18:39.552 --> 18:42.420
Damn it. Where
the hell did it go?

18:42.422 --> 18:44.322
It was just--

18:47.393 --> 18:49.527
how did you get over there?

18:55.568 --> 18:57.435
Jones?

18:57.437 --> 18:59.270
I got some weird stuff
happening in here, man.

18:59.272 --> 19:00.638
How about you?

19:03.643 --> 19:05.710
Jones?

19:05.712 --> 19:08.346
Hey, you okay?

19:08.348 --> 19:09.514
Jones!

19:13.186 --> 19:14.485
Jones?

19:16.289 --> 19:17.388
Jones!

19:26.733 --> 19:29.200
Jones is gone.

19:29.202 --> 19:30.668
- Define "gone".
- Well, I mean

19:30.670 --> 19:32.503
he ain't upstairs
and he ain't down here.

19:32.505 --> 19:34.338
I thought he might try to run
but the truck's still here.

19:34.340 --> 19:36.707
It's him.
It's the bad man.

19:36.709 --> 19:38.543
I just know it. He's got him
just like before.

19:38.545 --> 19:39.944
- We don't know that.
- What's the play, baird?

19:39.946 --> 19:42.847
- Give me a second.
- I'm thinking fire.

19:42.849 --> 19:44.415
Huh? If we burn
the joint down

19:44.417 --> 19:45.750
I bet it don't move around much.

19:45.752 --> 19:47.351
My friends are still
in here somewhere.

19:47.353 --> 19:49.720
And so is yours. We can't
just burn it down!

19:49.722 --> 19:51.923
Stop talking!
Everybody stop!

19:51.925 --> 19:53.424
It's a combat scenario,
all right?

19:53.426 --> 19:55.259
Let me think.

19:55.261 --> 19:58.963
It's a hostile theater,
hidden enemy, stealth attacks.

20:00.733 --> 20:03.201
There's a pattern.
There's always a--

20:03.203 --> 20:05.803
( phonograph music )

20:05.805 --> 20:10.274
--Creepy, old phonograph?

20:10.276 --> 20:11.976
Wait. That wasn't even there.

20:11.978 --> 20:13.578
That was not there
before, right?

20:13.580 --> 20:16.781
I'm so sick of this house.

20:16.783 --> 20:18.416
( Yells )

20:18.418 --> 20:19.684
Baird!

20:25.525 --> 20:27.892
Me?

20:27.894 --> 20:31.262
It got the others
and now it wants me?

20:31.264 --> 20:32.763
Not on my watch.

20:32.765 --> 20:37.468
Cassandra, you and Katie,
get out of this house.

20:37.470 --> 20:40.404
Take the car, go back
to Jenkins at the annex.

20:40.406 --> 20:41.706
No, I'm not leaving.

20:41.708 --> 20:43.708
I want to help find Ezekiel.
We're a team.

20:43.710 --> 20:44.976
We are not a team.

20:44.978 --> 20:46.711
You are the librarians.

20:46.713 --> 20:48.713
I am the guardian and
right now I'm telling you

20:48.715 --> 20:50.748
to get yourself and Katie
out of this damn house.

20:50.750 --> 20:52.450
You're not sending stone away.

20:52.452 --> 20:54.986
I need him.
He can fight.

20:54.988 --> 20:58.723
Cassandra, we all have
different skills.

20:58.725 --> 21:01.425
In this situation
your skills don't apply.

21:01.427 --> 21:04.829
If we don't find Jones,
well, at least one of us

21:04.831 --> 21:07.832
needs to make it back
to Jenkins and Flynn.

21:07.834 --> 21:09.667
Go.

21:13.406 --> 21:16.874
Wait! Cassandra, wait!

21:16.876 --> 21:18.876
Cassandra!

21:18.878 --> 21:21.846
What's wrong?
Are you okay?

21:21.848 --> 21:24.315
Just get in.

21:24.317 --> 21:25.616
I'm taking you
to the annex, as ordered.

21:25.618 --> 21:27.952
What's the annex?

21:27.954 --> 21:29.487
You want something out of the
way, that's where you put it.

21:29.489 --> 21:30.721
I don't understand.

21:30.723 --> 21:31.956
Isn't miss baird
trying to protect us?

21:31.958 --> 21:34.025
You, yes.

21:34.027 --> 21:36.594
"Math girl," not so much.

21:36.596 --> 21:38.062
Who's "math girl"?

21:38.064 --> 21:39.797
That would be me.

21:41.601 --> 21:43.834
The one who could
break at any second.

21:43.836 --> 21:45.436
The one who betrays her friends.

21:45.438 --> 21:46.771
You would never betray anybody.

21:46.773 --> 21:48.806
Except I did.

21:48.808 --> 21:50.474
Once.

21:52.578 --> 21:57.915
They treat me like if I do
anything else, I'll break.

21:57.917 --> 22:00.017
Will you?

22:00.019 --> 22:01.619
No.

22:03.723 --> 22:05.690
Maybe.

22:05.692 --> 22:07.892
I don't know.

22:09.729 --> 22:13.764
I have a tumor.
In my brain.

22:15.668 --> 22:20.471
It makes me useful
but unreliable.

22:23.376 --> 22:25.776
I wouldn't trust me yet either.

22:25.778 --> 22:29.380
That miss baird
is pretty hard, I guess.

22:29.382 --> 22:33.784
But she's trusting you to get me
out of here and to keep me safe.

22:33.786 --> 22:36.654
You think that she would have let
one of those other men do it?

22:36.656 --> 22:38.422
Which one?

22:38.424 --> 22:40.991
The one that wants
to burn the house down

22:40.993 --> 22:43.761
or the one that ran away?

22:44.797 --> 22:47.631
Miss baird trusts you.

22:47.633 --> 22:48.799
So do I.

22:51.904 --> 22:54.138
Thanks, Katie.

22:54.140 --> 22:56.741
Thanks.

22:56.743 --> 22:59.810
So, you're "math girl"?

22:59.812 --> 23:02.947
Yep, I'm math girl.

23:02.949 --> 23:06.584
And today math girl
is getting us out.

23:06.586 --> 23:08.919
( Thump )

23:08.921 --> 23:10.488
- Oh, my god!
- Oh, my god!

23:10.490 --> 23:11.922
Get out!

23:13.493 --> 23:15.459
Go! Go!

23:22.535 --> 23:23.968
( Steam hisses )

23:23.970 --> 23:27.104
Come on! Go! Run!

23:39.018 --> 23:40.618
( Clatters )

23:40.620 --> 23:41.819
Again?

23:41.821 --> 23:44.588
- Are you kidding me?
- Really?

23:44.590 --> 23:45.656
Where are all the shoes?

23:45.658 --> 23:46.824
What shoes?

23:46.826 --> 23:48.426
Jones said this room
was full of shoes.

23:48.428 --> 23:50.194
I got nothing.

23:50.196 --> 23:51.595
Why is it playing these games?

23:51.597 --> 23:52.596
Why did it attack
Katie and her friends?

23:52.598 --> 23:54.098
Why hide 'n seek with us?

23:54.100 --> 23:55.633
You wish you had something
to shoot, don't you?

23:55.635 --> 23:57.601
God, I want something to shoot!

23:57.603 --> 23:58.736
( Thumping )

23:58.738 --> 24:00.504
( Screaming )

24:04.510 --> 24:06.911
Help!

24:21.961 --> 24:23.060
What are you doing?
I told you to go.

24:23.062 --> 24:24.528
There was a hiccup.

24:24.530 --> 24:26.096
He's coming!
He's coming!

24:26.098 --> 24:27.465
Just help us block the door.

24:27.467 --> 24:28.766
What hiccup?
Who's coming?

24:28.768 --> 24:29.767
( Thumping )

24:29.769 --> 24:31.602
It's him!
The smoke man!

24:31.604 --> 24:35.139
Stone! Stone,
get down here!

24:41.013 --> 24:42.780
( Growls )

24:46.118 --> 24:49.153
I think we found the dark heart.

24:49.155 --> 24:52.122
( Video game sound effects )

24:52.124 --> 24:56.927
Yeah, takes a second to process.

24:56.929 --> 24:59.230
This is the doll--
we're in the Dollhouse.

24:59.232 --> 25:01.131
See? Got it in one.

25:01.133 --> 25:05.903
Why are we in the doll--
how are we in the doll house?

25:05.905 --> 25:09.173
Well, and this is
just a guess, mind you,

25:09.175 --> 25:12.610
but I'm going to say, "magic".

25:13.679 --> 25:18.582
Stone!

25:18.584 --> 25:20.818
Stone?

25:20.820 --> 25:23.220
Damn it.

25:30.763 --> 25:33.931
That's baird!

25:33.933 --> 25:35.900
Baird!

25:35.902 --> 25:38.002
Baird! We're in here!

25:38.004 --> 25:39.603
Baird!

25:44.877 --> 25:46.644
I tried that before.
She can't hear you.

25:46.646 --> 25:48.212
Samosa?

25:48.214 --> 25:50.014
No, I don't want a samosa.

25:51.951 --> 25:53.551
What's wrong with you?

25:53.553 --> 25:55.986
Well, I had sliders before
but for gaming,

25:55.988 --> 25:59.089
you really want something
a bit more bite-sized.

25:59.091 --> 26:01.859
What the hell do you want?

26:01.861 --> 26:03.561
( Gunshots )

26:10.903 --> 26:13.103
This house is trying to kill us.

26:13.105 --> 26:15.706
Pretty sure it's not.

26:15.708 --> 26:17.207
Mm.

26:17.209 --> 26:18.976
Actually, you'll love this.
Watch.

26:18.978 --> 26:22.079
I wish I had a pint.

26:22.081 --> 26:25.883
Oh, uh, left hand.

26:25.885 --> 26:28.252
Now tell me that's
not bloody fantastic!

26:30.323 --> 26:32.089
What have you been doing? Huh?
Dude, the whole time

26:32.091 --> 26:33.791
you've been playing
video games and drinking?

26:33.793 --> 26:35.626
And samosas. Yeah.

26:35.628 --> 26:37.328
I got tired of staring
at those damned pictures.

26:37.330 --> 26:41.732
I said, I wish there was something
better to do and, boom, Xbox One.

26:41.734 --> 26:43.167
What pictures?
What do you mean pictures?

26:43.169 --> 26:45.102
What pictures?

26:52.878 --> 26:54.345
This--

26:58.250 --> 27:00.117
this is a page from
the book of bright stars.

27:00.119 --> 27:03.287
This is abdurrahman sufi.
He made this.

27:03.289 --> 27:06.890
This has been lost since 960 ad.

27:06.892 --> 27:08.359
I'll take your word for it.

27:08.361 --> 27:10.260
You suss out the story yet?

27:10.262 --> 27:13.163
This house is in every picture.

27:13.165 --> 27:17.668
I mean, this is art
from the crusades.

27:17.670 --> 27:21.972
I mean the house,
it changes to fit the period.

27:21.974 --> 27:25.275
See, the way I reckon, this
place is wicked old, right?

27:25.277 --> 27:28.145
So, at the beginning
it's just happy families.

27:28.147 --> 27:31.649
Years of that
and then something--

27:31.651 --> 27:34.284
we got this wrong.

27:34.286 --> 27:37.187
We got the whole thing wrong.

27:37.189 --> 27:39.356
( Screaming )

27:42.028 --> 27:44.228
Get out of here!
Go!

27:47.266 --> 27:52.736
( Grunts )

27:52.738 --> 27:55.172
I told you to go, go!

27:55.174 --> 27:57.341
- Go!
- Come on!

27:59.412 --> 28:01.011

Come on!

28:10.122 --> 28:11.722
Come on, we have to go!
We have to run.

28:11.724 --> 28:12.756
She said to run!

28:12.758 --> 28:15.993
No, no.

28:15.995 --> 28:17.227
You go.

28:17.229 --> 28:19.196
I need to help my friend.

28:19.198 --> 28:20.998
The house wants you.

28:21.000 --> 28:24.101
If you get out than all
of this wasn't for nothing.

28:24.103 --> 28:26.270
We can both go, I mean
the car's right there.

28:26.272 --> 28:28.172
We can make it to texarkana
by the morning!

28:28.174 --> 28:29.773
There's a fort there and
there's soldiers! Come on!

28:29.775 --> 28:31.341
No, Katie.
The car is wrecked.

28:31.343 --> 28:35.012
Wait. Texarkana?

28:35.014 --> 28:36.914
We're in Slovakia.

28:36.916 --> 28:41.752
Slovakia?

28:41.754 --> 28:43.854
What? No.

28:43.856 --> 28:45.923
Jesse, this is--
Nevada.

28:45.925 --> 28:48.225
Right?

28:48.227 --> 28:51.995
This is desert.

28:51.997 --> 28:54.231
Buggies.

28:54.233 --> 28:56.834
That's what we need
because the horses--

28:56.836 --> 28:58.769
who's Jesse?

28:58.771 --> 29:02.873
Oh.

29:02.875 --> 29:05.109
Oh no, you're right.

29:07.980 --> 29:10.180
You're Cassie.

29:10.182 --> 29:11.849
Cassandra.

29:11.851 --> 29:16.220
Jesse was Scotland and so dead.

29:16.222 --> 29:18.489
Such a little screamer, too.

29:18.491 --> 29:20.290
Kids.

29:20.292 --> 29:23.994
Katie? What's wrong?
You're freaking me out.

29:23.996 --> 29:25.829
Me? Nothing.

29:25.831 --> 29:28.799
I'm just trying to get it all
straight again, you know?

29:28.801 --> 29:33.003
It's funny, I can never
remember where the begging goes.

29:33.005 --> 29:36.540
Does the crying come first?

29:36.542 --> 29:38.308
Oh, my god.

31:55.447 --> 31:58.215
My family.

31:58.217 --> 32:02.052
We killed a lot of people.

32:02.054 --> 32:03.687
Some for the money,

32:03.689 --> 32:07.324
but mostly for the fun.

32:08.594 --> 32:12.162
People caught on,
we were running.

32:12.164 --> 32:14.331
Real desperate.

32:14.333 --> 32:17.434
And then, like magic,

32:17.436 --> 32:22.506
boom, a fine little house
in the middle of nowhere.

32:22.508 --> 32:25.475
My family never knew
how special I was.

32:25.477 --> 32:29.513
Not one of them heard
this house whispering.

32:29.515 --> 32:34.418
But I did.

32:34.420 --> 32:36.253
Do you need help, Katie?

32:38.490 --> 32:44.494
Why yes, magic house,
I surely do.

32:44.496 --> 32:48.398
Wishes, wishes, wishes...
( Echoing )

32:49.435 --> 32:54.137
Hey!
You listening up there?

32:54.139 --> 32:57.307
This is a magic house.

32:57.309 --> 32:59.609
And it's mine!

32:59.611 --> 33:02.312
It only talks to me.

33:02.314 --> 33:07.084
So you talk, huh?

33:07.086 --> 33:08.652
I sure wish you
could talk to me.

33:13.192 --> 33:17.361
Okay. It's okay.

33:17.363 --> 33:22.399
So it's not actual speech but
I'll work with what I've got.

33:22.401 --> 33:27.237
It's a good beginning.

33:27.239 --> 33:31.675
Happy, you were happy,
the people were happy.

33:33.746 --> 33:37.280
But then the bad people came.

33:37.282 --> 33:41.551
Katie's family.

33:41.553 --> 33:43.120
That's Katie.

33:57.036 --> 33:59.569
( Phonograph music )

34:05.144 --> 34:08.045
Are we making friends up there?

34:08.047 --> 34:12.815
You think I don't know
this house hates me?

34:12.818 --> 34:15.719
Think it doesn't
try this every time?

34:18.657 --> 34:23.326
Tries to warn people?

34:23.328 --> 34:24.761
I made a wish and
it has to give me

34:24.763 --> 34:29.433
what I asked for,
every time 'til I'm done.

34:29.435 --> 34:32.069
You know what's so funny?

34:32.071 --> 34:33.770
I'll never be done.

34:33.772 --> 34:35.839
Stupid house.

34:35.841 --> 34:39.242
Always playing tricks.
Always laughing.

34:39.244 --> 34:41.678
Well, she'll be screaming soon.

34:41.679 --> 34:44.748
Then we'll see who's laughing.

34:44.750 --> 34:48.552
Hiding, are we?

34:48.554 --> 34:50.853
( Phonograph skipping )

35:00.466 --> 35:02.632
Sorry, that was bothering me.

35:05.537 --> 35:09.673
Well, now, I thought you were
supposed to be math girl.

35:09.675 --> 35:14.511
It's not very smart
giving me only two choices.

35:25.357 --> 35:27.157
Hmm.

35:28.360 --> 35:32.662
I wonder where math girl is.

35:32.664 --> 35:35.332
She's not in the closet.

- No.
- You're so stupid.

don't you know
what I wished for?

don't you know what
this house has made me?

right, Cassandra.

nothin' in the end.

Please, please.
Help me.

36:51.243 --> 36:54.411
We can stop this.
Please help me stop this!

36:54.413 --> 36:57.847
Lord. Why on earth
would I want to stop?

36:57.849 --> 37:00.483
I wasn't talking to you.

Oh, someone's
trying to be clever.

37:20.339 --> 37:23.607
You think you're death?

37:23.609 --> 37:27.944
I was fifteen when they told me

37:27.946 --> 37:31.948
that my death sits right here.

37:31.950 --> 37:36.386
So I see it every time
I look in the mirror.

37:36.388 --> 37:37.921
Every day.

37:37.923 --> 37:42.292
Every single day.

37:42.294 --> 37:44.628
Stop this!
You can't!

37:44.630 --> 37:47.864
I'm the angel!
I'm the angel of death!

37:47.866 --> 37:49.933
( Grunts )

37:49.935 --> 37:52.602
You're not the angel of death.

37:52.604 --> 37:55.372
I know what death looks like

37:55.374 --> 37:58.375
and she doesn't look like you.

37:58.377 --> 38:00.510
She looks like <i> me.</i>

38:03.749 --> 38:07.884
See?
Told you.

38:07.886 --> 38:09.819
I always get my wish.

38:16.561 --> 38:19.663
( Screaming )

38:19.665 --> 38:21.765
No!

38:25.837 --> 38:31.508
It isn't about wishes, Katie.

38:31.510 --> 38:35.679
It's about need.

38:35.681 --> 38:38.415
And I really need--

38:47.426 --> 38:49.626
( birds chirping )

39:18.056 --> 39:19.889
Looks like someone's
feeling better.

39:19.891 --> 39:22.759
All I'm saying is all's well
that ends well. Check the list.

39:22.761 --> 39:25.128
All I'm saying is,
it could have got a lot worse.

39:25.130 --> 39:28.465
Absolutely. I could have been
dragged around on my face.

39:28.467 --> 39:30.767
I'm just asking, why aren't
we considering our options?

39:30.769 --> 39:32.369
What are our options, Jones?

39:32.371 --> 39:34.537
That this house is
the Star Trek transporter.

39:34.539 --> 39:35.972
Or, maybe even the tardis.

39:35.974 --> 39:38.541
Think, mate. We could
own the stock markets.

39:38.543 --> 39:40.777
You could be dating,
whoever it is

39:40.779 --> 39:42.979
backwoods country people
think is hot--

39:42.981 --> 39:43.980
- hey.
- I don't know.

39:43.982 --> 39:46.383
This place is a gravy train.

39:46.385 --> 39:50.453
Colonel baird.
Eve, if I may.

39:50.455 --> 39:53.623
I've never asked
for anything in my life.

39:53.625 --> 39:57.627
Please, let me have this.

39:57.629 --> 40:00.463
It grants wishes, Eve.

40:00.465 --> 40:02.532
You know what I wish right now?

40:02.534 --> 40:05.535
I wish I had
something for this <i> eye.</i>

40:07.773 --> 40:09.439
( Groans )

40:13.645 --> 40:15.979
The house doesn't Grant wishes.

40:20.485 --> 40:23.686
It helps people in need.

40:23.688 --> 40:26.489
It was built as a refuge.

40:26.491 --> 40:29.759
No one ever expected a
serial killer to find it.

40:29.761 --> 40:31.828
It won't make
the same mistake again.

40:31.830 --> 40:33.830
So, we can keep it?

40:34.866 --> 40:37.767
Easy now, boys.

40:40.772 --> 40:44.808
Guys, meet the spirit
of the house of refuge.

40:52.717 --> 40:55.552

41:03.929 --> 41:05.895
Everybody ready?

41:05.897 --> 41:07.130
We're good.

41:07.132 --> 41:08.798
Let's just get this over with.

41:08.800 --> 41:10.166
Bloody idiots.

41:10.168 --> 41:14.938
Okay, you, be good.
Okay?

41:26.184 --> 41:27.484
Shove over.

41:27.486 --> 41:28.485
What?

41:28.487 --> 41:30.520
I'm driving.

41:47.739 --> 41:50.039
"The bloody benders."

41:55.547 --> 41:57.647
John, Katherine, Jack and Katie.

41:57.649 --> 41:59.983
An entire family
of serial killers.

42:01.686 --> 42:03.753
They killed at least
twelve victims across Kansas

42:03.755 --> 42:08.925
and Nebraska in the 1800s,
before they just disappeared.

42:08.927 --> 42:10.960
Now we know why.

42:10.962 --> 42:15.198
They found the house of refuge
and Katie bender made a wish.

42:15.200 --> 42:19.102
Aside from not getting to see
a mystery house for myself,

42:19.104 --> 42:21.070
all in all,
a job very well done.

42:21.072 --> 42:22.939
Thank you, Mr. Jenkins.

42:22.941 --> 42:25.074
We'll see you in 19 hours.

42:34.052 --> 42:35.818
Tea.

42:35.820 --> 42:38.187
Oh, my god.

42:38.189 --> 42:41.858
I can actually feel the
smugness coming off your body.

42:41.860 --> 42:43.626
Music.
I need music.

42:43.628 --> 42:47.697
( Music from phonograph plays )

42:47.699 --> 42:49.766
No. No bloody way.
Turn it off.

42:49.768 --> 42:52.936
No way.
I like it.
