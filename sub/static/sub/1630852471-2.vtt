-[Karamo laughs]
-[Tan] Yes, ma'am!

00:29.612 --> 00:32.115
Our angel this week is literally an Angel.

00:32.198 --> 00:33.700
-Our hero this week, honey.
-Aww!

00:33.783 --> 00:34.993
Here I am.

00:35.076 --> 00:36.828
"Her name is Angel Flores."

00:36.911 --> 00:39.748
"She's 22. She now lives in Austin."

00:39.831 --> 00:43.251
"She's an athlete and a coach
who just graduated from UT."

00:43.334 --> 00:44.961
-Yay!
-Yes!

00:45.045 --> 00:49.007
I coach Olympic weightlifting,
and I compete in powerlifting.

00:49.090 --> 00:51.051
-Powerlifting, that's no joke.
-Yes!

00:51.134 --> 00:53.720
"She was nominated by Vinny,
her coach, and Katia, her girlfriend."

00:54.721 --> 00:56.765
-[exhales]
-There's nobody like Angel.

00:57.515 --> 01:00.060
Oh, that was just a flex. [laughs]

01:00.143 --> 01:02.228
I'm like, okay,
I am not gonna do that one.

01:02.312 --> 01:03.563
-Why not?
-[laughing]

01:03.646 --> 01:05.690
Any time I tell people about Angel,

01:05.774 --> 01:07.859
I always kind of warn them ahead of time,

01:07.942 --> 01:10.487
"Hey, you're gonna be
around this woman for about 30 seconds

01:10.570 --> 01:13.948
and you're gonna fall in love with her,
because you can't not love Angel."

01:14.032 --> 01:14.866
Drive it up!

01:14.949 --> 01:16.034
[man yells] Come on, girl!

01:16.117 --> 01:17.952
-[sighs]
-Easy peasy.

01:18.036 --> 01:19.996
-Whoo!
-[Angel laughing]

01:20.080 --> 01:22.040
[Vinny] She's extremely driven.

01:22.123 --> 01:25.001
About two weeks ago, she competed
in her first powerlifting competition.

01:25.085 --> 01:27.003
She moved mountains.

01:27.087 --> 01:29.506
Nice 402 pounds like nothing.

01:30.090 --> 01:32.217
She now holds the state record.

01:32.300 --> 01:34.135
Angel's a very strong woman.

01:34.761 --> 01:37.138
She's so unapologetically her.

01:37.222 --> 01:40.683
And I wish that that could be
implemented more in her everyday life,

01:40.767 --> 01:42.727
and not in just her lifting.

01:42.811 --> 01:45.396
[Katia] It's interesting
to see her go out into the world

01:45.480 --> 01:47.440
and, like,
literally make herself smaller

01:47.524 --> 01:50.693
because I don't think
she feels comfortable as who she is.

01:51.361 --> 01:54.489
[Angel] I've always just been really,
really insecure about my body.

01:54.572 --> 01:56.741
I guess it took me 20 years
to realize that, like,

01:56.825 --> 02:00.495
it's not that I needed
to find a more masculine body

02:00.578 --> 02:02.580
or be ripped or be shredded.

02:02.664 --> 02:04.332
It's that I needed to transition.

02:06.334 --> 02:08.461
[Katia] She looks like
she wants to steal your medicine.

02:08.545 --> 02:11.714
-You don't want any T blockers, baby.
-[both laugh]

02:11.798 --> 02:15.343
[Angel] Austin Pride 2019, I, like,
shaved my legs for the first time.

02:15.426 --> 02:16.845
I, like, put the sports bra on,

02:16.928 --> 02:19.097
and I put on, like,
a pair of, like, tiny shorts,

02:19.180 --> 02:22.058
and I looked in the mirror,
and I was like, "That's me."

02:22.142 --> 02:25.603
[chuckles] It was, like, so freeing.

02:25.687 --> 02:28.273
My cocoon just kind of went… boop.
And, like, that was it.

02:28.857 --> 02:32.277
[Vinny] She's always in gym clothes,
running around in a sports bra

02:32.360 --> 02:33.278
and short shorts,

02:33.361 --> 02:37.198
and she doesn't know quite
how to be anything other than that.

02:37.782 --> 02:39.159
I'm built like a fridge.

02:39.868 --> 02:41.536
-You're a very cute fridge.
-[laughs]

02:41.619 --> 02:45.707
I'd love it if Angel wore
not sports clothes on a date. [laughs]

02:45.790 --> 02:47.959
"Outside the gym,
Angel's extremely self-conscious

02:48.042 --> 02:49.919
about how she presents herself in public,

02:50.003 --> 02:53.423
and she still shies away from most
public spaces out of fear of rejection."

02:53.506 --> 02:54.340
[Karamo] Wow.

02:54.424 --> 02:58.636
The idea of doing any kind of shopping
outside of grocery shopping alone is just…

02:58.720 --> 03:00.054
[whistles] …terrifying.

03:00.138 --> 03:02.056
Absolutely terrifying
and anxiety-inducing.

03:02.140 --> 03:05.393
Who's watching me pick out clothes?
Is this going to fit my body type?

03:05.476 --> 03:06.686
Do I go to a fitting room?

03:06.769 --> 03:10.023
Am I gonna put this on
and immediately get an anxiety attack?

03:10.106 --> 03:12.192
It's just… it really sucks.

03:13.026 --> 03:16.404
[Vinny] Angel is truly finding who she is,

03:16.487 --> 03:18.656
but she still has those
few speed bumps to get over.

03:19.240 --> 03:21.659
She is
at a very pivotal point in her life,

03:21.743 --> 03:26.039
and she just needs
to be shown that she's perfect. [laughs]

03:26.122 --> 03:30.752
[Vinny] I feel like only people that
have been in the queer community

03:30.835 --> 03:32.003
can show her that path,

03:32.086 --> 03:37.175
and I think that would
make her feel so seen.

03:37.258 --> 03:42.055
Yes! We want her to feel comfortable
and safe and herself everywhere she goes.

03:42.138 --> 03:46.434

both inside the gym and out!"

to see herself as beautiful.

[Tan] Angel, when you were a kid,
was this the goal,

05:57.315 --> 05:59.859
to be an Olympic athlete,
or is this a new thing?

05:59.942 --> 06:01.861
I've been playing sports
since I was, like, seven.

06:01.944 --> 06:04.822
My dad put me through every
single one of those sports growing up,

06:04.906 --> 06:06.574
soccer, baseball, everything.

06:06.657 --> 06:08.743
I sucked at every single one of 'em,
except football.

06:08.826 --> 06:12.330
Like, my dad made sure to tell me,
like, "You are playing all these sports."

06:12.413 --> 06:16.125
Like, even if I was just sitting
on the field playing with the flowers,

06:16.209 --> 06:18.920
it was always, like,
"I'm trying to make him proud."

06:19.003 --> 06:21.381
And then I became a teenager,
and all of a sudden,

06:21.464 --> 06:25.134
I'm second team all-district football,
and I'm, like, really, really good.

06:25.218 --> 06:28.346
And then through UT, I joined
the Olympic weightlifting team there,

06:28.429 --> 06:32.225
and that's where I found
my dream of like, "Oh, athletics."

06:32.308 --> 06:33.142
-Yeah.
-Okay.

06:34.936 --> 06:36.896
[Tan] How long have you
lived in this neighborhood?

06:36.979 --> 06:39.315
[Angel] Um, let's see.
About a month and a half.

06:39.399 --> 06:41.484
-[Tan] You're really new.
-[Angel] We just moved in.

06:41.567 --> 06:43.528
-[Antoni] Love these little plants.
-[Bobby] Right?

06:43.611 --> 06:45.655
-[Karamo laughs]
-Our little plant friends.

06:45.738 --> 06:47.240
-Come into my home.
-Home!

06:48.241 --> 06:50.034
[Tan] It's a great space.

06:50.118 --> 06:51.828
[Angel] Yeah, it's really, really nice.

06:51.911 --> 06:54.831
She's lacking personality,
but you've only been here a month.

06:54.914 --> 06:58.042
And you got butt plugs already?
That is cute.

06:58.126 --> 06:59.585
-What is this for?
-Your feet.

06:59.669 --> 07:04.841
Angel is young. Angel is 22,
and this is her first proper home.

07:05.591 --> 07:08.219
This place is a mess.

07:08.302 --> 07:11.722
It is definitely looking very student-y.
But she's no longer a student.

07:14.308 --> 07:17.395

We've got athleisure covered.

07:17.478 --> 07:22.316
Ooh, there's a nice little fireplace
behind here.

07:22.400 --> 07:24.193
-Put your finger in here.
-Oh, God.

07:24.277 --> 07:26.320
-Are you gonna Julia Roberts me?
-[Antoni] Oh!

07:26.404 --> 07:27.864

07:27.947 --> 07:30.116
-[Jonathan] Can I?
-You remember the Julia Roberts thing?

07:30.199 --> 07:32.034
[guffawing]

07:32.743 --> 07:34.495
-Whoa!
-[Angel] Yep. Those come off.

07:34.579 --> 07:37.665
-Those come off. They are hella broken.
-We'll fix that. We'll fix that.

07:38.249 --> 07:40.543
-I wouldn't mind seeing her in that.
-What about me?

07:40.626 --> 07:41.502
I love a crop moment.

07:41.586 --> 07:44.672
-Can you throw that out and I'll keep it?
-Yes, I'll take that for you.

07:44.755 --> 07:46.048
Whoo! This is really pretty.

07:46.132 --> 07:47.842
-I actually love this dresser.
-[Angel] Yeah.

07:47.925 --> 07:50.636
I wish I could do more with it
in terms of, like, decoration,

07:50.720 --> 07:52.805
but I have no clue
how to decorate anything.

07:52.889 --> 07:55.308
-Lucky I'm here.
-I guess this is why you're here. [laughs]

07:57.351 --> 07:59.103
[Antoni] A lot of dirty dishes

07:59.187 --> 08:03.107
and a dishwasher that is full
and hasn't been turned on yet. Okay.

08:03.191 --> 08:04.775
Okay. Yes.

08:07.153 --> 08:08.446
No. [chuckles]

08:08.988 --> 08:12.158
Ooh. [sighs]

08:12.992 --> 08:14.660
I know what this is, honey.

08:16.662 --> 08:19.373
-[ball thuds]
-[sighs]

08:19.957 --> 08:24.253
Strength sport. Yes, for the medals.
Yes, for already winning awards!

08:24.337 --> 08:25.838
[Jonathan] You're in a whole new world.

08:25.922 --> 08:29.592
How do you feel with your confidence
in how you present yourself in the world?

08:29.675 --> 08:32.178
In the world and in the gym
are two very different things, right?

08:32.261 --> 08:34.764
But it's weird because they both exist…

08:34.847 --> 08:36.224
-In the world?
-In the world.

08:36.307 --> 08:37.850
[laughs] Um…

08:37.934 --> 08:41.187
In the gym, I feel like I'm
the most confident person in the room.

08:41.270 --> 08:44.190
Outside of the gym,
you'll probably find me doing this a lot

08:44.273 --> 08:46.317
and, like, holding myself like this
and just like…

08:46.400 --> 08:47.902
-"Don't look at me."
-The body language.

08:47.985 --> 08:50.988
So, we just have to figure out
how to get you into your gym energy.

08:51.072 --> 08:51.948
And so in that way,

08:52.031 --> 08:56.244
I think that, you know, hair and makeup,
we can use as a tool, if it helps.

08:56.327 --> 08:59.872
I did a full face once,
and it was a, like, whole panic attack.

08:59.956 --> 09:01.207
I, like, don't self-care.

09:01.290 --> 09:04.669
Like, I have never had a nail day.
I've never had, like, a mani/ped--

09:04.752 --> 09:05.836
I've never done any of that.

09:05.920 --> 09:08.464
I would challenge you to rethink
how you think about self-care,

09:08.548 --> 09:10.550
because you actually do
do self-care in the gym.

09:10.633 --> 09:14.845
You do a lot of stuff that brings you joy,
but we just need to diversify.

09:14.929 --> 09:17.515
'Cause if you're only, like,
going into the one joy road, honey,

09:17.598 --> 09:20.810
if that joy road
has to get shut down for repairs,

09:20.893 --> 09:22.395
what else road are you gonna take?

09:22.478 --> 09:24.438
So, we just gotta
teach you some new routes.

09:24.522 --> 09:25.648
Yeah. Definitely.

09:25.731 --> 09:27.608
[Tan] There were things
that made me think,

09:27.692 --> 09:29.902
"Okay, you've been exploring."

09:30.528 --> 09:31.737
-Crop?
-I wore it, like, once.

09:31.821 --> 09:33.614
I didn't know what to pair it with,

09:33.698 --> 09:36.951
and, like, the one time I wore it
I was like, "Ah, it didn't feel right."

09:37.034 --> 09:39.495
[Tan] This closet seems very sporty,

09:39.579 --> 09:42.832
and I don't see you in your closet.

09:42.915 --> 09:45.167
I… I don't know. Like, I've never--

09:45.251 --> 09:48.296
I haven't pinned down my style yet.
I haven't pinned down Angel's style.

09:48.379 --> 09:49.213
Okay.

09:49.297 --> 09:52.967
I've always, like,
really liked grungy, like, '90s rock.

09:53.050 --> 09:55.094
The ripped jeans and the fishnets.

09:55.177 --> 09:57.179
But, like,
I have no idea what looks good on me.

09:57.263 --> 09:59.682
If I were passing you on the street
and I'd never met you

09:59.765 --> 10:03.144
and you were to walk past me
in your favorite outfit,

10:03.227 --> 10:04.770
what do you want me to think?

10:04.854 --> 10:07.231
I would like to feel, like, sexy.

10:07.315 --> 10:08.941
-Great. That's what I wanna know.
-Yeah.

10:09.025 --> 10:10.860
-I would love to feel sexy.
-Okay.

10:10.943 --> 10:14.280
[laughs] 'Cause I definitely don't
feel sexy most of the time.

10:14.363 --> 10:17.825
I don't know how to highlight the feminine
parts of my body. 'Cause I lift…

10:17.908 --> 10:20.161
-That's your job.
-I'm an athlete. Like, that's what I do.

10:20.244 --> 10:23.456
And so you wanna find a way
to balance the person that you are at work

10:23.539 --> 10:24.957
and the person you are inside.

10:25.041 --> 10:26.584
One hundred percent.

10:27.168 --> 10:28.878
[Antoni] Was food important growing up?

10:28.961 --> 10:31.797
-[Angel] Like, I was always eating.
-[Antoni] Who made food? Mom or Dad?

10:31.881 --> 10:33.549
-My mom cooked everything.
<i>-</i>[Antoni] Really?

10:33.633 --> 10:35.843
Uh, my dad would barbecue,
like, once a week, probably.

10:35.926 --> 10:37.720
-But my mom was, like, the--
-Such a dad.

10:37.803 --> 10:39.388
I know, right? [laughs]

10:39.472 --> 10:40.723
But it was always good, though.

10:40.806 --> 10:43.225
Let's not get it twisted.
His barbecue was great.

10:43.309 --> 10:46.187
But my mom cooking, like, day to day,
week to week, was very, very nice.

10:46.270 --> 10:48.189
What would she make
that would get you excited?

10:48.272 --> 10:50.441
Everything. Her father, he's Filipino.

10:51.025 --> 10:53.235
-So there's Filipino influences there.
-[gasps]

10:53.319 --> 10:57.323
She would come in here and make pansit.
I'm sure I'm butchering that.

10:57.406 --> 11:00.034
Don't look at me like I speak Tagalog,
because I do not.

11:00.117 --> 11:01.035
[laughs]

11:01.118 --> 11:04.622
-[Fab Five] Hi!
-[laughing]

11:04.705 --> 11:07.917
-[Karamo] How you doin'?
-[Bobby] How are you? Great to meet you.

11:08.000 --> 11:10.002
[ominous music playing]

11:13.214 --> 11:16.133
[Tan] I'd love a moment
to just chat to you, please.

11:17.301 --> 11:22.181
So, you started dating Angel
as a heterosexual relationship.

11:22.264 --> 11:23.099
Correct.

11:23.182 --> 11:28.354
As Angel started transitioning,
did you at any point struggle with it?

11:28.437 --> 11:30.272
Uh, yeah, there were definitely times.

11:30.356 --> 11:33.693
I mean, I think at the beginning
it was really, like, kind of rough.

11:33.776 --> 11:35.736
-It was just like, "Is this what I want?"
-Yeah.

11:35.820 --> 11:37.571
That was the self-question
you have to ask.

11:37.655 --> 11:41.117
Like, is this something that
I am mentally capable to handle?

11:41.200 --> 11:43.703
But I just--
I love her, and I love her a lot.

11:43.786 --> 11:48.958
And, like, to me, like,
that's more important than anything else.

11:49.041 --> 11:51.001
-I'm gonna high five you real quick.
-[laughs]

11:51.085 --> 11:53.504
[Tan laughs] That's what I was hoping
you were gonna say.

11:53.587 --> 11:56.841
You said you started to transition
when you were 21?

11:56.924 --> 12:00.219
-Yeah, 21.
-How's your family since you started?

12:00.302 --> 12:03.305
My mom and my siblings
have been really, really great.

12:03.389 --> 12:05.474
They took the time to, like, process.

12:05.558 --> 12:06.642
And what about your father?

12:07.351 --> 12:10.354
Because your father was the one
that sort of inspired you

12:10.438 --> 12:14.525
and sort of pushed you when it came
to, like, being in the sports arena.

12:15.067 --> 12:16.110
[Angel sighs]

12:16.986 --> 12:20.698
I made it my last, like, barrier

12:20.781 --> 12:23.659
to starting hormone therapy
to go and talk to my dad

12:23.743 --> 12:25.453
and say like, "This is what I'm doing

12:25.536 --> 12:28.622
for my health, like, sometimes
I don't wanna be here anymore."

12:28.706 --> 12:32.293
And we haven't spoken
since that conversation.

12:32.918 --> 12:35.296
Last Thanksgiving and last Christmas,
he just didn't show up.

12:35.379 --> 12:36.797
What happened?

12:38.132 --> 12:40.843
Um, he just doesn't understand why.

12:42.553 --> 12:43.429
I don't know, like…

12:45.973 --> 12:48.851
I want him to see, like, that, like,

12:48.934 --> 12:51.020
I'm smiling
this big for the first time in my life.

12:51.896 --> 12:55.900
I'm feeling like I truly am myself,
but there is just one thing missing.

12:56.817 --> 12:58.235
I just want my dad back.

13:00.446 --> 13:02.656
Like, I just want my dad back. I…

13:03.407 --> 13:04.700
He hasn't been here. [chuckles]

13:04.784 --> 13:10.581
And I've done a lot of really cool things
since I started transitioning, and…

13:11.749 --> 13:14.168
everybody else
is saying that they're proud of me.

13:14.752 --> 13:16.420
But my dad has just never said that…

13:16.504 --> 13:17.338
[Karamo] Yeah.

13:17.421 --> 13:19.924
…like, since I started transitioning.
[sniffles]

13:20.966 --> 13:23.594
Would it be okay with you
if I reached out to him?

13:24.261 --> 13:27.598
So that you can sort of start
that journey maybe to get your dad back?

13:28.557 --> 13:29.475
-Yeah.
-Yeah?

13:29.558 --> 13:31.685
Yeah, I would really like that. [chuckles]

13:31.769 --> 13:35.356
I'm all about facilitating this
conversation between Angel and her father.

13:35.940 --> 13:37.983
He had such an influence on her life,

13:38.067 --> 13:41.695
and now that person is gone,
and there's a void there.

13:41.779 --> 13:42.613
Hey, babe.

13:42.696 --> 13:45.741
-Cute couple alert. Oh, my gosh!
-[Karamo] I know.

13:45.825 --> 13:47.743
[Tan] Why do you think
this'll be good for Angel?

13:47.827 --> 13:50.162
Uh, I don't know.
I think you guys could help her a lot.

13:50.246 --> 13:53.249
I'm just like you--
I love you, but you need some help.

13:53.332 --> 13:55.042
[laughing]

13:55.125 --> 13:58.462
It's really gonna take
four gay men and my non-binary queen

13:58.546 --> 14:00.256
to teach me how to be a girl.

14:00.339 --> 14:05.135
You know what I have to say? We want to
teach you how to do what you wanna do.

14:05.219 --> 14:07.388
You are a woman. This is girl.

14:07.471 --> 14:09.932
You know how to be feminine.
You know how to feel confident.

14:10.015 --> 14:12.101
We just need
to get you comfortable in that.

14:12.184 --> 14:13.561
-[laughs]
-[Karamo] You ready?

14:13.644 --> 14:14.728
Yes, very much.

14:14.812 --> 14:16.063
-All right.
-Yes!

14:16.146 --> 14:17.356
You can kiss your lady.

14:17.439 --> 14:18.691
-Goodbye.

that Angel's trying
to figure out right now,

14:29.952 --> 14:34.415
so I wanna help her at least
try to figure out her decor style

14:42.256 --> 14:45.759
that she knows that she's beautiful,
that she deserves to be confident,

14:45.843 --> 14:49.597
that she deserves to be herself
in the world exactly how she is.

14:50.264 --> 14:52.391
[Antoni] I wanna get together
with Angel and her mom

14:52.474 --> 14:54.518
to find out about Angel's life,

14:54.602 --> 14:58.397
because I really do think the best
conversations are always around a meal.

14:58.480 --> 14:59.440
[Tan] Whoo…

14:59.523 --> 15:03.068
Angel is special
because she's so warm,

15:03.152 --> 15:05.404
and it's so clear
that she's spent all these years

15:05.487 --> 15:08.073
living a life that wasn't truly hers,

15:08.157 --> 15:10.534
and so I want
to help her feel like the woman

15:10.618 --> 15:13.037
she's always wanted to feel like.

15:13.787 --> 15:16.206
[Karamo] Angel has a great
support system at the gym,

15:16.290 --> 15:18.834
but this week,
I plan on helping her talk to her father

15:18.918 --> 15:22.212
because she needs answers from where
her relationship stands with her dad,

15:22.296 --> 15:24.673
but also I want Angel to know

15:24.757 --> 15:27.092
it doesn't matter
who accepts or denies you

15:27.176 --> 15:29.720
as long as you accept and love yourself.

15:41.190 --> 15:43.275
Well, well, well, welcome to Raven Row.

15:43.359 --> 15:46.111
-The most gorgeous salon in the world.
-Oh, thank you.

15:46.862 --> 15:50.532
Um, hitting us with the gorge-osity
first thing in the morning.

15:50.616 --> 15:52.284
Let's talk about your color.

15:52.368 --> 15:54.578
You have some gorgeous,
like, red lights happening.

15:54.662 --> 15:57.915
Do you want people to be like, "That's,
like, really natural gorgeous hair color"?

15:57.998 --> 15:59.667
Or do you mind people being like,

15:59.750 --> 16:01.669
"That's got a little kick to it,
but I like it"?

16:01.752 --> 16:04.171
You just made both
of those things sound very, very great.

16:04.254 --> 16:07.091
-And I can't decide.
-I know I did. I felt it as I said that.

16:07.174 --> 16:10.135
So maybe it's almost kind of like
a happy medium between those things.

16:10.219 --> 16:11.929
I feel everything I do
is a happy medium, so…

16:12.012 --> 16:13.847
-I love a happy medium.
-[laughs]

16:13.931 --> 16:18.185
It's so important that Angel comes
into this process knowing she's complete

16:18.268 --> 16:20.729
and she doesn't need to change for anyone.

16:20.813 --> 16:23.190
However, I'm a beauty expert.

16:23.273 --> 16:26.777
I need to just teach her other ways
that she can practice self-care

16:26.860 --> 16:30.322
so that she feels beautiful and confident,
because she's stunning.

16:30.406 --> 16:32.825
I wanted to do your hair first

16:32.908 --> 16:35.035
because I just wanted us to have funsies

16:35.119 --> 16:38.706
and have you feeling
confident and thriving.

16:38.789 --> 16:40.416
That would definitely be, like, great.

16:40.499 --> 16:44.253
Like, I wish I was the same person, like,
out in the world that I was in the gym.

16:45.087 --> 16:47.881
Like, it's really funny that I've done
all this work to find myself,

16:47.965 --> 16:52.011
because, like, it feels like there's still
so much I just don't know about myself.

16:52.094 --> 16:54.638
[Jonathan] Everyone is still
on that same kind of journey.

16:54.722 --> 16:55.848
-Yeah.
-Know what I mean?

16:56.432 --> 16:57.391
So, that's okay.

16:57.474 --> 17:00.310
Like, I didn't have any role models
as a kid that I could look up to,

17:00.394 --> 17:02.396
and, like, I never saw a trans person.

17:02.479 --> 17:06.316
My only role models were my dad
and then athletes that I would see.

17:06.400 --> 17:07.526
I just didn't feel right.

17:08.110 --> 17:11.405
Like, I would, like, spend
whole class days in high school

17:11.488 --> 17:14.199
just, like, mulling, like,
"I don't feel good. I don't feel good."

17:14.283 --> 17:17.077
"Why do I feel so awful all the time?"

17:17.161 --> 17:22.958
Then once you'd transitioned and made
that connection, that part relaxed.

17:23.042 --> 17:26.003
[Angel] Yeah. I only started HRT,
like, ten months ago.

17:26.086 --> 17:28.380
Once I started taking the hormones,
it just disappeared.

17:28.464 --> 17:31.800
How's your family been over the last year?

17:31.884 --> 17:34.428
Uh, like, the majority of my family, like,

17:34.511 --> 17:36.680
went through the steps
of, like, understanding

17:36.764 --> 17:39.558
and learning and educating
themselves and asking me questions.

17:39.641 --> 17:40.517
[Jonathan] Mm-hmm.

17:40.601 --> 17:42.603
[Angel] But before
I started transitioning,

17:42.686 --> 17:44.938
I would see them, like,
at least once or twice a month.

17:45.022 --> 17:47.858
But after transition, I literally
just said, "I don't wanna see 'em."

17:47.941 --> 17:50.444
"I don't wanna have to deal with it.
I don't wanna have to, like,

17:50.527 --> 17:53.572
jump through the hoops
of, like, basically forcing them

17:53.655 --> 17:58.202
to, like, rewrite everything
that they know about me."

17:59.203 --> 18:01.789
I don't know. Like,
I always just feel like I'm being selfish.

18:01.914 --> 18:03.123
[Jonathan] I'd consider this.

18:03.207 --> 18:06.251
Do you think that it's ever been, like,
a cis-het society that was selfish

18:06.335 --> 18:09.129
in making you conform
to something that wasn't your truth,

18:10.047 --> 18:12.633
and now you're just unlearning that?

18:12.716 --> 18:15.844
Because you're not being selfish
for living your truth.

18:15.928 --> 18:19.515
And I think that the people who,
you know, love you and are close to you

18:19.598 --> 18:22.810
are really gonna wanna see you thrive.

18:24.019 --> 18:27.022
And if people can't come to you
with that compassion and patience,

18:27.106 --> 18:29.274
then that relationship
just wasn't meant to be right now.

18:29.858 --> 18:30.943
Yeah.

18:31.026 --> 18:34.655
Angel is a smart,
hardworking, beautiful woman.

18:34.738 --> 18:37.533
She doesn't need
someone else's validation,

18:37.616 --> 18:39.743
because we can't control other people.

18:39.827 --> 18:42.079
So the first person
and most important person

18:42.162 --> 18:44.873
to come to a place
of acceptance with is yourself.

18:44.957 --> 18:47.543
-I'm so proud of you, girl.
-[laughs]

18:48.127 --> 18:51.505
To be 22 and just be where you are,

18:51.588 --> 18:54.299
I hope you stop
to smell those roses sometimes.

18:54.383 --> 18:56.969
I don't know, I think
I just lose the roses sometimes.

18:57.052 --> 18:59.805
That's okay.
I think awareness is the first key.

18:59.888 --> 19:03.183
I think we're realizing that
we have a little, tiny bit of a deficiency

19:03.267 --> 19:07.938
in celebrating how far we've come,
which is not problem-specific to you.

19:08.021 --> 19:10.983

[beautician] What we do
wanna add back to the face

19:41.180 --> 19:43.682
is a little bit of color with blush.

19:43.765 --> 19:47.436
And I use it, like, where the sun would,
like, burn you, in a sense,

19:47.519 --> 19:50.606

more flirty and natural to the eye.

-Blown away. Okay, should we shop?

21:05.847 --> 21:08.141
[Tan] I wanna know what your
shopping experiences have been

21:08.225 --> 21:09.518
up to this point.

21:09.601 --> 21:11.353
Honestly, I hate shopping in person.

21:11.436 --> 21:13.105
Last week, I walked into a store,

21:13.188 --> 21:16.984
and before I knew it,
I'm walking past mirrors in the store,

21:17.067 --> 21:18.360
and I'm seeing my body.

21:18.443 --> 21:22.281
And of course, like, a beautiful girl
walks behind me, and, like, I see her,

21:22.364 --> 21:26.034
and I'm thinking,
"I will never look like that."

21:26.118 --> 21:28.996
"And I'll never be able to feel
that good and feel that comfortable."

21:29.579 --> 21:32.874
And before I knew it,
I was, like, hyperventilating,

21:32.958 --> 21:34.084
I started crying.

21:34.167 --> 21:36.753
Katia had to grab me and take me
out of the store and be like,

21:36.837 --> 21:40.424
"Are you okay? What's wrong?
What are you feeling?"

21:40.507 --> 21:42.884
And at that point,
I didn't know even what I was feeling.

21:42.968 --> 21:44.761
-Yeah.
-It was just despair.

21:44.845 --> 21:47.514
-Yeah.
-And dysphoria. And just awful.

21:48.307 --> 21:50.267
Just looking at this, I want to be like,

21:50.350 --> 21:52.352
"None of this will ever fit me
or look good on me."

21:52.436 --> 21:54.855
And is it because the size of the clothes,

21:54.938 --> 21:58.483
or is it because you've never really
experienced this kind of clothing before?

21:58.567 --> 22:00.610
-I'm really just clueless.
-Yeah.

22:00.694 --> 22:02.321
The struggle for me has just been like

22:02.404 --> 22:06.074
separating thick
and strong and dense with masculine.

22:06.158 --> 22:09.328
But also, like, not having
to lean so far into, like,

22:09.411 --> 22:11.538
the super-bright colors
and the super-femininity

22:11.621 --> 22:15.292
and the, like, hyper-femininity that a lot
of trans women are expected to lean into.

22:15.375 --> 22:20.172
You can still feel feminine even though
it's not pink, and it's not poofy.

22:20.255 --> 22:21.089
Yeah.

22:21.173 --> 22:24.468
Masculinity and femininity,
I could not care less about.

22:24.551 --> 22:27.095
However, for Angel,
it's clearly a concern.

22:27.179 --> 22:31.058
And so I want to just find
what makes her feel

22:31.141 --> 22:33.143
a version of herself
that she's never felt before.

22:33.226 --> 22:34.436
-You ready?
-[Angel] Yes.

22:34.519 --> 22:36.813
-Can you come out and show us?
-[Angel] Okay.

22:39.358 --> 22:41.318
[Tan] Tell me how you feel,
what you're thinking.

22:41.401 --> 22:43.570
Um, I do not recognize
this girl in the mirror.

22:43.653 --> 22:46.031
-[laughing]
-At all.

22:46.114 --> 22:50.369
This is, um, probably, like, the first,
like, actual dress I've ever tried on.

22:51.078 --> 22:52.913
Like, literally just,
like, put a sundress on

22:52.996 --> 22:54.998
and tried it on and said, "Ha ha! No."

22:55.082 --> 22:58.001
And I threw it away. Even with all
the strength that I have in these arms,

22:58.085 --> 23:01.088
I'm super insecure
about, like, how big my arms are.

23:01.171 --> 23:04.966
But, like, even in this dress,
they look skinnier, and it feels good.

23:05.050 --> 23:08.512
You were saying earlier that you look
at the other girls when you go shopping

23:08.595 --> 23:09.805
and you see their curves.

23:09.888 --> 23:11.348
Because of the way it's cut,

23:11.431 --> 23:14.851
it gives you a little,
itty-bitty waist, itty-bitty waist.

23:14.935 --> 23:16.353
-[laughs]
-And then hips.

23:16.436 --> 23:18.480
It's kind of a trick of the style.

23:19.189 --> 23:22.651
Would you feel like, "Okay, I could
wear this dress out somewhere"?

23:23.235 --> 23:26.530
I don't know. I get,
like, super insecure about this roll,

23:26.613 --> 23:30.200
'cause this is,
like, left over from before HRT.

23:30.283 --> 23:32.369
I don't know any woman,

23:32.452 --> 23:36.248
other than maybe
the world's top supermodel,

23:36.331 --> 23:40.001
who doesn't have
that little bit of shape there.

23:40.085 --> 23:42.879
There's no more there
than anyone else has.

23:42.963 --> 23:43.922
Okay.

23:44.005 --> 23:46.716
I would like you to be kinder
to yourself when you look in the mirror.

Okay, tell me why it's hot.
I know, but I want you to tell me.

[Angel] It shows, like, my muscle,
and, like, my figure.

24:16.538 --> 24:19.624
But, like, the loose pants,
like, give me a little bit more curve

24:19.708 --> 24:22.544
than, like, I would if I was wearing
completely skin-tight everything.

24:22.627 --> 24:24.171
It accentuates the hips.

24:24.254 --> 24:26.798

but also, like, strong,

like, dressed myself like this.

encourages her to feel
completely comfortable in her own skin,

in other areas of her life.

27:22.849 --> 27:26.019
my rule on large pieces in the home,

27:26.102 --> 27:30.273
like sofas, beds, dining tables,
do things that are neutral.

27:30.357 --> 27:34.986
And then pillows and rugs you can
switch out, depending on how you feel.

I also know that
your favorite color is green.

would be cute for you, because it's green…

27:57.342 --> 28:00.220

So three different materials.

[emotional music playing]

28:22.283 --> 28:27.372
[man] The whole past year has been tough,
because for 21 years I raised a boy.

28:27.455 --> 28:31.960
I haven't really, truly processed
what my kid is going through.

28:32.043 --> 28:35.714
-Have you ever met anybody who is trans?
-No.

28:35.797 --> 28:38.925
I know nothing about the trans community.

28:39.008 --> 28:41.720
Like the big thing,
they're all trying to use restrooms.

28:41.803 --> 28:43.596
To me, it wasn't a big deal.

28:43.680 --> 28:46.641
But then it directly affected my family.

28:46.725 --> 28:47.892
It came to your house.

28:47.976 --> 28:52.731
So, this is something hard for me to
actually take in and move forward with it.

28:53.773 --> 28:56.109
My biggest fear in seeing my kid

28:56.192 --> 28:58.403
is that exterior that
I have not yet grasped.

28:58.486 --> 29:01.614
And what's the fear? Of, like, seeing--

29:01.698 --> 29:04.826
Of not seeing
the child that you have in your mind?

29:04.909 --> 29:05.744
[Jose] Yeah.

29:06.327 --> 29:08.204
[Karamo] But I think sometimes as parents,

29:08.288 --> 29:12.542
you know, we have one image of the life
we think our child is gonna have,

29:12.625 --> 29:15.086
and then when that image doesn't happen,
we start to grieve it.

29:15.170 --> 29:16.045
Yeah.

29:16.129 --> 29:19.132
But I want you to know that
the image you had for your child

29:19.215 --> 29:20.175
is not that far off.

29:21.092 --> 29:24.804
And there's a happiness there,
but Angel misses you.

29:25.722 --> 29:28.433
Angel misses you
more than I think you even know.

29:31.770 --> 29:34.439
[Jose] I… I just kinda wanna know
how that process started.

29:34.522 --> 29:36.149
I guess that's my biggest thing,

29:36.232 --> 29:40.403
is where that.. that mindset,
or change of mindset, came from.

29:40.987 --> 29:42.947
[voice breaks]
Because there's a true void…

29:46.951 --> 29:49.245
in my heart that I've been missing.

30:01.299 --> 30:03.134
[Antoni] I'm so excited to make these.

30:03.218 --> 30:06.513
We have soy, rice wine vinegar,
a little bit of sugar,

30:06.596 --> 30:09.599
and sometimes I like to put a bit
of scallion or green onion in as well.

30:09.682 --> 30:11.601
I do that with
scallion pancakes sometimes.

30:11.684 --> 30:15.021
-Oh, that sounds good, actually.
-Yummy, salty, sharp.

30:15.104 --> 30:17.899
-Hey.
-Oh, my gosh!

30:17.982 --> 30:20.276
-[Christina] Oh, my gosh!
-[Antoni] I love this.

30:20.360 --> 30:23.571
-Sorry, have a mother/daughter moment.
-[laughs]

30:25.114 --> 30:27.575
[Antoni] When life is changing
around you so much,

30:27.659 --> 30:29.619
a recipe can kind of bring you back.

30:30.203 --> 30:32.205
-Yeah, it looks good.
-[laughs] Thanks, Mom.

30:32.288 --> 30:36.417
[Antoni] Food does have
this incredible power of nostalgia.

30:36.501 --> 30:39.420
Your face lit up when I started asking you
about, like, food you remember

30:39.504 --> 30:40.588
when you were growing up,

30:40.672 --> 30:44.592
and you mentioned Mom made<i> lumpia.</i>
Have you ever made this together?

30:44.676 --> 30:47.720
I don't think we ever made it together.
I haven't eaten it in years.

30:47.804 --> 30:50.014
-In years?
-[Angel] Years. So good.

30:50.098 --> 30:52.767
Especially when she makes it,
like, it's just iconic.

30:52.851 --> 30:55.270
-[Christina] That's a nice thing to say.
-[both laughing]

30:55.353 --> 30:57.605
-[Antoni] Mom is here to teach us today.
-Exactly.

30:57.689 --> 31:01.860
Lumpia are these pretty traditional
Filipino fried spring rolls

31:01.943 --> 31:03.820
that have all kinds
of different fillings in 'em.

31:03.903 --> 31:05.989
A little thing that
I like to do with ground meat,

31:06.072 --> 31:07.615
I just kind of slice through it.

31:07.699 --> 31:11.494
So this helps crumble it a little bit so
that it'll fall apart a little more easily

31:11.578 --> 31:13.454
-once it's in the pan.
-You're not mashing it.

31:13.538 --> 31:15.081
-[Antoni] Exactly.
-Oh, my goodness.

31:15.164 --> 31:16.958
[Antoni] Do you wanna cut the cabbage?

31:17.041 --> 31:19.127
-I'm already terrified.
-You're already terrified?

31:19.210 --> 31:20.336
I curl my fingers,

31:20.420 --> 31:24.382
and then I use the point
of the knife as kind of my guide.

31:24.465 --> 31:26.092
-Is this thin enough?
-[Christina] Yes.

31:26.718 --> 31:28.845
-Nothing like a mom's approval.
-[laughing]

31:28.928 --> 31:31.306
-[Antoni] What's next?
-[Christina] We start the vegetables.

31:31.389 --> 31:34.767
[Antoni] So, we have cabbage,
green onion, the carrots.

31:34.851 --> 31:36.102
Garlic. Soy sauce.

31:36.686 --> 31:38.479
[Antoni] And a little bit of oyster sauce.

31:38.563 --> 31:41.649
We're actually able
to find <i>lumpia </i>wrappers.

31:41.733 --> 31:42.567
[Christina gasps]

31:42.650 --> 31:45.236
You would think I've been
to Chipotle enough to figure this out.

31:45.320 --> 31:49.157
[laughs] And we have egg wash here,
just to let it hold together.

31:49.908 --> 31:51.951
-Boom. Did it.
-Look at that!

31:52.035 --> 31:55.079
I just watch until they're kind of
golden brown on each side.

31:55.163 --> 31:57.457
[Antoni] Angel was telling me how,
when she was growing up,

31:57.540 --> 31:58.666
her dad is the one who, like,

31:58.750 --> 32:01.711
pushed her towards, like,
basically doing every single sport.

32:02.962 --> 32:05.465
It's interesting that now it feels like

32:05.548 --> 32:07.675
I'm achieving the things
that he wanted me to achieve,

32:07.759 --> 32:08.885
even when I was younger.

32:08.968 --> 32:11.471
You know?
Do you remember my last football game?

32:11.554 --> 32:14.349
I came off the field, and I was crying,
and I was, like, weeping,

32:14.432 --> 32:17.060
"My athletic career's over."

32:17.143 --> 32:20.438
And he gave me this big hug,
and he told me he was proud of me, and…

32:20.521 --> 32:22.857
-He's so good at those hugs.
-[Angel] He is really good.

32:23.441 --> 32:25.568
[Christina] I understand
because your last competition,

32:25.652 --> 32:27.111
I was sitting there thinking, like,

32:27.195 --> 32:33.451
"Gosh, I'm here," but knowing, like,
"I'm not who she wants there, really."

32:33.534 --> 32:38.498
It's not that he doesn't love you,
or he doesn't--

32:38.581 --> 32:40.833
It's just trying to understand--
You know how he is.

32:40.917 --> 32:42.794
He gets-- He has to come on his own time.

32:42.877 --> 32:44.212
Everybody needs a moment.

32:44.295 --> 32:48.174
Like, the love of my life, like, needed
time to work through it for herself.

32:48.758 --> 32:52.053
We can't simply expect everybody
to just instantly switch.

32:52.136 --> 32:56.057
Right. Just because we're ready, we can't
make that assumption of other people.

32:56.140 --> 33:00.395
What brought me to peace is
seeing your face for the first time

33:00.979 --> 33:04.232
after you started transitioning
and the smile.

33:05.274 --> 33:08.569
And then just knowing that you're happy.

33:09.195 --> 33:10.989
[Antoni] Angel's mom is so supportive.

33:11.072 --> 33:12.657
She's so vulnerable and open

33:12.740 --> 33:16.202
about what her struggles were
with Angel's transition.

33:16.285 --> 33:20.164
But she just sees her kid,
and she wants her to be happy.

33:20.248 --> 33:22.208
That's acceptance right there.

33:22.291 --> 33:26.713
He's coming from
a traditional Mexican family,

33:26.796 --> 33:29.966
and it was-- you know,
it's one way and that's it.

33:30.049 --> 33:32.468
But I think he's getting there. So…

33:32.552 --> 33:33.928
-[Antoni] Time takes time.
-It does.

33:34.012 --> 33:34.971
Time takes time.

33:35.054 --> 33:37.265
It really does. You know?

33:37.348 --> 33:39.851
Speaking of time, I think these are ready.

33:39.934 --> 33:41.853
So, what's going on
at the end of the week?

33:41.936 --> 33:44.939
We're gonna have some friends over
to, like, warm our house,

33:45.023 --> 33:46.733
since we haven't had that quite yet.

33:46.816 --> 33:49.652
So, it'd be nice to maybe
make this this week.

33:49.736 --> 33:52.363
-[Antoni] Think everyone would enjoy this.
-[Angel] Me too.

33:57.368 --> 33:59.287
Definitely missed that. That is…

34:00.997 --> 34:02.540
childhood right there.

34:02.623 --> 34:05.043
[Christina] I'm just really happy
that we got to do this.

34:26.939 --> 34:28.775
-Amazing.
-You look so good, by the way.

34:28.858 --> 34:32.153
-[laughs] Stunning. Like, my God.
-Thank you. Yesterday was nuts.

34:32.236 --> 34:33.362
Awesome.

34:33.446 --> 34:36.115
Well, I wanted to bring you in
and talk to you because,

34:36.199 --> 34:39.035
you know, one of the things
we talked about was support.

34:39.702 --> 34:42.872
You spoke to me very clearly
about you and your father's relationship.

34:42.955 --> 34:45.875
What do you need to feel more confident
when it comes to your family?

34:45.958 --> 34:47.543
Particularly your father?

34:47.627 --> 34:52.757
I think I just need to hear from him
that, like, it's okay for me to be me.

34:52.840 --> 34:57.720
Is it hard to look at me, or is it hard
to wrap his head around what I'm doing?

34:57.804 --> 35:01.849
I think sometimes in our community,
the LGBTQIA community,

35:01.933 --> 35:04.393
a lot of times we feel
the other person has the power.

35:04.477 --> 35:06.395
I don't subscribe
to the word "coming out"

35:06.479 --> 35:08.523
because the act is
actually letting people in.

35:08.606 --> 35:09.440
[Angel] Mm-hmm.

35:09.524 --> 35:10.775
And when you say "coming out,"

35:10.858 --> 35:13.694
you're actually giving the other person
the power to reject or deny you,

35:13.778 --> 35:16.114
and for me, it's like,
"You don't have that power."

35:16.197 --> 35:20.910
You are in power to say,
"I'm inviting you into my life again."

35:21.953 --> 35:27.917
I met up with your dad, and I asked,
"Do you want to speak and meet?"

35:28.000 --> 35:30.169
And he said yes.

35:31.629 --> 35:34.549
Do you feel comfortable in me
calling him and inviting here

35:34.632 --> 35:36.134
for you to have a conversation?

35:38.010 --> 35:39.220
-You do?
-Yeah, I do.

35:39.303 --> 35:41.097
[Karamo] This is a moment for Angel.
It's like,

35:41.180 --> 35:44.725
"Either I'm going to love myself
and you come along that journey,

35:44.809 --> 35:46.519
or I might have to lose you."

35:48.187 --> 35:49.939
That is so hard.

35:50.022 --> 35:52.984
And I just wanna be here
to support her through all of this.

35:53.860 --> 35:55.236
[knock on door]

35:59.574 --> 36:00.616
-[Karamo] Hey.
-[Jose] Hey.

36:00.700 --> 36:02.326
-[Karamo] Good to see you.
-[Jose] You too.

36:02.410 --> 36:04.078
-How are you?
-[Karamo] I'm good.

-Mm-hmm. Yeah.

-Nice kicks.
-Thank you.

[all chuckling]

36:46.037 --> 36:48.831

36:48.915 --> 36:51.417
-Yeah, I'm… I'm kind of in the same boat.
-[laughs]

36:51.500 --> 36:55.588
It's… It's definitely been a tough year.

36:55.671 --> 36:57.048
-A long year.
-[Jose] Yeah.

36:57.131 --> 37:00.134
-[sniffles]
-[Jose sighs]

37:02.428 --> 37:06.015
What questions, Angel,
do you have that you wanted answered?

37:08.726 --> 37:09.894
[Angel] I just, like…

37:12.313 --> 37:16.484
I just wanted to know, like,
why was it so hard to see me?

37:16.567 --> 37:20.655
Did you expect, like,
a massive difference? Like--

37:20.738 --> 37:22.782
Yes. I did.

37:22.865 --> 37:24.367
My biggest fear…

37:26.285 --> 37:27.411
was seeing you.

37:28.579 --> 37:29.956
That was it. [sniffles]

37:31.207 --> 37:33.167
You know, for 21 years I raised a boy.

37:33.251 --> 37:37.964
You know?
It… It felt like I had failed you.

37:39.715 --> 37:41.884
I truly, truly miss you.

37:41.968 --> 37:43.636
Um, I miss having you in my life.

37:45.429 --> 37:50.518
You know, I would like to know what
actually, um, helped you in the process.

37:51.269 --> 37:55.481
Just because I know
we both need each other in our lives.

37:56.315 --> 37:58.276
It was like I never asked the question.

37:58.359 --> 38:00.152
It's like,
if you never broach the subject,

38:00.236 --> 38:01.612
you don't know what the subject is.

38:02.321 --> 38:07.118
And it was just, like, this underlying
feeling of, like, "Something's different."

38:07.201 --> 38:11.330
As much as I hung out and played football
with those guys and that group of boys,

38:11.414 --> 38:13.499
like, I didn't feel like one of them.

38:13.582 --> 38:14.417
Sure.

38:14.500 --> 38:16.877
When I called myself a she
and when I called myself Angel,

38:16.961 --> 38:19.380
like, all the other doubts
about everything else went away.

38:21.007 --> 38:25.761
It's hard to grasp
when… when your child tells you,

38:25.845 --> 38:29.223
you know, something different
from that envisioning that you had,

38:29.307 --> 38:31.767
you know, for your…
for your child to grow up.

38:32.435 --> 38:36.772
But talking to you now,
you sound like the same kid I raised.

38:36.856 --> 38:38.858
[laughing]

38:38.941 --> 38:41.819
When you try to raise a son,

38:41.902 --> 38:44.864
our culture's always been,
"Our boys are tough,

38:44.947 --> 38:47.867
and men are men" sort of thing.
They grow up to be men, good men.

38:47.950 --> 38:52.079
You know, and that you treat
your… your women as a princess.

38:52.163 --> 38:56.709
That's always been what…
what we were taught, you know?

38:56.792 --> 39:02.048
So, that was always a hard part of--
I just couldn't see you as a her.

39:02.131 --> 39:04.633
-Well, I'm not a damn princess, Dad.
-[laughing]

39:04.717 --> 39:06.677
[Angel] I don't want to be a princess.

39:06.761 --> 39:10.097
Like, I'm still all those qualities
you put out, besides the man part.

39:10.181 --> 39:11.932
Like, that's still me.

39:12.016 --> 39:14.268
Everybody keeps telling me, like,
"You work hard."

39:14.352 --> 39:16.020
"You put your nose to the grinder."

39:16.103 --> 39:18.731
Whenever I coach, like,
I… I think about that.

39:18.814 --> 39:21.609
-And I wanna be like you, still.
-[laughs]

39:21.692 --> 39:27.365
You wanted me to one day say
that you've made me the man I am?

39:27.990 --> 39:30.159
You've made me the woman I am.

39:31.619 --> 39:36.540
Like, I couldn't do any of the things
that I've done so far, like, without you.

39:37.625 --> 39:42.046
And the entire time I was doing it,
I was just… I wanted my dad, you know?

39:42.838 --> 39:44.256
My thought has just been, like,

39:44.340 --> 39:49.220
if he could see the way I smile now
and how happy I am, the glowing, and…

39:49.303 --> 39:53.265
Your mom kept telling me,
"If you could see her, how happy she is."

39:53.349 --> 39:54.433
"You'll be happy."

39:57.645 --> 39:59.688
And at the end of the day,
that's all we want.

or I'm gonna be real embarrassed.

[Jose laughs]

50:09.589 --> 50:12.926
At different times of the year,
our skin needs different things.

50:13.010 --> 50:15.929
In the winter, I like to use
more of a cream-based moisturizer.

50:16.013 --> 50:17.431
It's a bit heavier.

50:17.514 --> 50:20.976
It really gives your skin
the big drink of water that it needs

50:21.059 --> 50:22.853
from the cold, dry air.

50:22.936 --> 50:26.023
For the summer, I like to switch to a gel.

50:26.106 --> 50:29.109
They're a little bit more lightweight.
It's more readily absorbed.

50:29.192 --> 50:30.277
Yes.

50:30.944 --> 50:34.072
Don't waste that extra moisturizer
on your fingertips. Give it to your lips…

50:34.823 --> 50:36.825
for an extra kiss of moisture.
