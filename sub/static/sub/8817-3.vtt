And it's this --

09:35.533 --> 09:39.133
that I'm accepted as I am.

09:39.133 --> 09:41.433
Completely.

09:41.433 --> 09:43.734
For my good qualities,
sure,

09:43.734 --> 09:47.533
but also for all...

09:47.533 --> 09:50.700
of my filth.

09:50.700 --> 09:55.166
And I appreciate a woman
who is that giving.

09:55.166 --> 09:56.600
I truly do.

09:58.500 --> 10:01.400
[inhales sharply] But there's
more to it, isn't there?

10:01.400 --> 10:04.367
The...act
you're talking about

10:04.367 --> 10:06.166
has to do
with power dynamics.

10:06.166 --> 10:08.533
Dominance.

10:08.533 --> 10:10.700
Maybe ask why this is
coming up for you now.

10:12.433 --> 10:14.567
Is there a work connection?

10:14.567 --> 10:18.567
Someone you feel isn't looking
at you like she should?

10:21.433 --> 10:23.300
Maria Saldana. Wow.

10:26.266 --> 10:28.033
What happened?

10:28.033 --> 10:30.467
She was kind of a bastard about
her bonus at quarterly review,

10:30.467 --> 10:33.033
and then she went and got
an offer away.

10:33.033 --> 10:34.433
Yeah, but she's still here.

10:34.433 --> 10:36.567
Yeah, but she threatened
to leave,

10:36.567 --> 10:38.100
leveraging us to make
a bigger offer,

10:38.100 --> 10:40.467
which we will,
and I think she stays.

10:40.467 --> 10:42.200
-You feel played.
-Yeah, I do.

10:42.200 --> 10:43.600
Then why did you make her
the counter

10:43.600 --> 10:46.467
if you feel that way?
-Because she's great at her job.

10:46.467 --> 10:48.033
Her P&L's always green.

10:48.033 --> 10:50.066
She grew her capital
from 50 to $300 million.

10:50.066 --> 10:51.600
Men renegotiate.

10:51.600 --> 10:54.066
If they do it this way,
they get fired.

10:54.066 --> 10:55.333
So it's really not because
she's a woman?

10:55.333 --> 10:58.166
No, it's because she got
out of line.

10:58.166 --> 11:00.233
You know that we're upping
Donnie Caan's capital --

11:00.233 --> 11:01.467
tripling it.
I asked Axe why.

11:01.467 --> 11:04.066
He said, "Donnie's loyal,
a good soldier."

11:04.066 --> 11:05.734
And in your mind,
Maria's not.

11:05.734 --> 11:09.166
It doesn't matter.
I'll keep her.

11:16.066 --> 11:18.266
You gonna tell me about
that smile?

11:18.266 --> 11:21.633
Well, I'll keep her,

11:21.633 --> 11:24.533
but she won't have
much fun.

11:24.533 --> 11:29.433
It's my duty to make
an example of her now.

11:29.433 --> 11:32.133
You cannot leverage us.

11:32.133 --> 11:34.633
So over the next two years,

11:34.633 --> 11:36.467
she'll get cut back
in ways she can't control.

11:36.467 --> 11:37.767
She'll get less deal flow,

11:37.767 --> 11:39.233
less information will
fall into her lap.

11:39.233 --> 11:41.400
At the end of her deal,

11:41.400 --> 11:44.066
she'll be worth a quarter
of her current comp.

11:44.066 --> 11:47.133
â™ª dramatic music â™ª

11:47.133 --> 11:49.567
Ass-to-mouth,

11:49.567 --> 11:52.000
whether she likes it
or not.

11:52.000 --> 11:54.367
[indistinct conversations]

11:54.367 --> 11:56.000
-Hey, Christine.
-Oh, hey, Lara.

11:56.000 --> 11:57.700
-I have you in the 10:00, right?
-Yeah.

11:57.700 --> 11:59.233
So you get the whole
book tour treatment?

11:59.233 --> 12:01.233
-Local press, store signings?
-Yes, all of that.

12:01.233 --> 12:03.166
Oh, so fun. Hey, Lara.

12:03.166 --> 12:04.266
Hi, ladies.

12:04.266 --> 12:05.700
Congratulate June.

12:05.700 --> 12:07.066
Oh, on what?

12:07.066 --> 12:09.266
Goose Quill is publishing
her memoir

12:09.266 --> 12:11.300
on how she got through 9/11.

12:11.300 --> 12:13.667
Wow. Congratulations, June.

12:13.667 --> 12:15.166
Yeah, it's just, you know,

12:15.166 --> 12:17.166
it's just a story
I wanted to tell.

12:17.166 --> 12:18.400
-[chuckles]
-So cool, right?

12:18.400 --> 12:21.533
Yeah, super-duper.

12:21.533 --> 12:24.400
Well, congrats again.
Can't wait to read it.

12:27.233 --> 12:30.100
[sighs softly]

â™ª pensive music â™ª

12:37.066 --> 12:40.266
Hi. It's Lara Axelrod for
Shari Strang in communications.

12:40.266 --> 12:41.367
â™ªâ™ªâ™ª

12:41.367 --> 12:44.467
[cellphone vibrates]

12:44.467 --> 12:47.000
-Lara, hey.
-Hey, Shari.

12:47.000 --> 12:50.400
Listen, I need you
to get something for me.

12:50.400 --> 12:53.266
This is more.

12:53.266 --> 12:55.367
This is much more than...

12:56.433 --> 12:57.700
I didn't come in here

12:57.700 --> 12:59.734
trying to get you to do
what you're doing.

12:59.734 --> 13:02.667
Well, if you had,
I wouldn't be.

13:02.667 --> 13:04.734
And it makes good sense.

13:04.734 --> 13:06.600
Should make a pretty big
difference to the family.

13:06.600 --> 13:08.467
Game changer for us.

13:08.467 --> 13:12.266
-Bring Wags in?
-Yeah.

13:12.266 --> 13:14.667
-Axe.
-Yeah?

13:14.667 --> 13:16.333
Thank you for your trust.

13:16.333 --> 13:17.600
Thank you for earning it.

13:17.600 --> 13:18.734
[door closes]

13:18.734 --> 13:21.734
This is huge.
I wanna thank you, too.

13:21.734 --> 13:24.233
I told Donnie we've always
known we could trust him.

13:24.233 --> 13:26.734
It's official. We're gonna
triple up his stack,

13:26.734 --> 13:28.567
back him with the main fund
when we can.

13:28.567 --> 13:31.667
He'll need one-on-ones,
some IPOs, and another analyst.

13:31.667 --> 13:34.600
Excellent.
Shooter shooter, coming out.

13:34.600 --> 13:37.200
Get started with 200,000 shares
of Rubinex.

13:37.200 --> 13:40.333
That's a big position.
Are you sure?

13:40.333 --> 13:41.600
We are not uncertain.

13:41.600 --> 13:43.467
You're gonna be
our Brian Doyle.

13:43.467 --> 13:44.767
-Who?
-Brian Doyle.

13:44.767 --> 13:47.266
He's a utility player
on the '78 Yankees.

13:47.266 --> 13:49.000
He's a lifetime
.168 hitter.

13:49.000 --> 13:50.333
That's below the Mendoza.

13:50.333 --> 13:52.600
But in the '78 World Series,

13:52.600 --> 13:55.100
Willie Randolph got hurt,
Doyle stepped in,

13:55.100 --> 13:56.667
hit .438,
played like an MVP.

13:56.667 --> 13:59.633
-Legendary.
-You're gonna be Brian Doyle.

13:59.633 --> 14:02.433
I'm gonna be Brian Doyle.

14:04.767 --> 14:08.000
Amelia, I know
it's a high profile case.

14:08.000 --> 14:10.233
But, uh, I'm building
something here.

14:10.233 --> 14:11.500
So can we horse trade?

14:11.500 --> 14:13.266
Listening.

14:13.266 --> 14:14.700
The Schachetti brothers.

14:14.700 --> 14:17.200
You gonna give me
the Schachetti brothers?

14:17.200 --> 14:18.600
You like?

14:18.600 --> 14:22.000
You propose to trade
a high-flying hedge fund manager

14:22.000 --> 14:23.533
for a couple of old goombahs

14:23.533 --> 14:26.367
throwing elbows
over garbage pickups in Queens?

14:26.367 --> 14:29.567
Maybe, uh, you don't understand
how horse trading works.

14:29.567 --> 14:32.100
Uh, you don't open
with your, uh --

14:32.100 --> 14:34.700
You can't offer me your mule
for my thoroughbred.

14:34.700 --> 14:38.533
You're hoping I'm dumb enough
to go for that.

14:38.533 --> 14:41.500
So fuck you and the horse
you didn't ride in on.

14:41.500 --> 14:42.734
[receiver thuds]

14:45.033 --> 14:48.000
I think maybe she does
understand horse trading.

14:51.133 --> 14:52.567
[telephones ringing,
indistinct conversations]

14:52.567 --> 14:54.400
[man] Just find it.

14:54.400 --> 14:57.400
[indistinct conversations
continue]

14:57.400 --> 14:58.667
File you asked about.

14:58.667 --> 15:00.400
What?

15:00.400 --> 15:01.667
Sakurov cyber fraud case.

15:01.667 --> 15:04.200
Oh, right. Thanks.

15:04.200 --> 15:06.467
Any luck with the, uh,
douche bags from Eastern?

15:06.467 --> 15:08.066
[chuckles] Not yet.

15:11.233 --> 15:14.266
-Hey.
-Hi.

15:14.266 --> 15:17.467
Well, I, uh, heard from
that agent over there and, uh,

15:17.467 --> 15:20.066
Decker's junior is being
very  cooperative.

15:20.066 --> 15:23.233
-Son of a bitch.
-Yeah, I know. I'm sorry.

15:23.233 --> 15:24.433
[sighs]

15:24.433 --> 15:26.166
All right, well,
catch you later.

15:26.166 --> 15:27.767
Yeah.

15:31.700 --> 15:34.233
-She's good, isn't she?
-Yeah.

15:34.233 --> 15:36.233
Yeah, it's important
to develop

15:36.233 --> 15:37.567
good relationships
with agents.

15:37.567 --> 15:40.066
Oh, yeah, I know.
You told me that first day.

15:40.066 --> 15:42.633
Can't stress that enough.

15:42.633 --> 15:44.166
So what's going on
with Eastern?

15:44.166 --> 15:46.033
Ah.

15:46.033 --> 15:49.300
Spyros, the SEC, pulled a move
on the Axelrod case.

15:49.300 --> 15:50.533
What?

15:50.533 --> 15:51.700
They got a guy
to flip on Decker,

15:51.700 --> 15:53.433
one of
Axelrod's spin-offs.

15:53.433 --> 15:55.166
-Pete Decker?
-Yeah.

15:55.166 --> 15:58.367
He's got a couple billion
in assets under management.

15:58.367 --> 15:59.567
Ties to Axelrod.

15:59.567 --> 16:01.333
Mm, you  wanted to flip him.

16:01.333 --> 16:02.633
That was the plan.

16:02.633 --> 16:04.600
You have all the leverage
you need?

16:04.600 --> 16:07.066
[chuckles] No such thing.

16:07.066 --> 16:10.467
I'll grind on it.

16:10.467 --> 16:12.667
Like, uh, Terri.

16:12.667 --> 16:15.633
She looks
like a real grinder.

16:18.767 --> 16:21.767
[scoffs, chuckles]

16:21.767 --> 16:23.734
As members of the board
of YumTime...

16:23.734 --> 16:25.367
Gathered informally.

16:25.367 --> 16:26.734
...you must wanna know

16:26.734 --> 16:29.467
if my acquiring
almost 5% of your company

16:29.467 --> 16:31.033
is a vote of confidence.

16:31.033 --> 16:34.734
So let me put an end
to the suspense -- it isn't.

16:34.734 --> 16:38.467
Mr. Axelrod is prepared
to increase his position

16:38.467 --> 16:40.467
and file with the SEC.

16:40.467 --> 16:41.567
In addition to its stake,

16:41.567 --> 16:43.633
Axe Capital controls
a significant percentage

16:43.633 --> 16:45.600
of the silent money votes
in this company.

16:45.600 --> 16:47.767
Which means,
come proxy season,

16:47.767 --> 16:51.400
there's a road for all of you
being out on your asses.

16:53.133 --> 16:55.133
It's all in the letter,
which can be released publicly.

16:55.133 --> 16:58.033
We're all aware
of activist letters,

16:58.033 --> 17:00.767
and Mr. Axelrod's history
with such.

17:00.767 --> 17:03.567
A seat at the table and a say
in management decisions.

17:03.567 --> 17:05.233
Based on what?

17:05.233 --> 17:07.166
The fact that YumTime profits
have declined 8 years running,

17:07.166 --> 17:11.734
while executive compensation
has soared 300%.

17:11.734 --> 17:13.567
And Hutch Bailey III
has been CEO

17:13.567 --> 17:16.367
for exactly that span of time.

17:17.667 --> 17:20.667
I'm not here
as a declaration of war,

17:20.667 --> 17:22.500
but as a beacon of hope --

17:22.500 --> 17:25.066
someone who knows how
a business should be run,

17:25.066 --> 17:26.633
who sees exactly why
your brand

17:26.633 --> 17:27.700
is bleeding market share,

17:27.700 --> 17:29.367
from the ingredients
to the marketing.

17:29.367 --> 17:32.233
You are in a room full
of career business operators.

17:32.233 --> 17:33.300
Absolutely.

17:33.300 --> 17:35.100
And I've been made to understand

17:35.100 --> 17:37.133
that you're
the reasonable board members

17:37.133 --> 17:40.133
who see how tenuous
the future of YumTime is.

17:40.133 --> 17:42.133
We could be as reasonable
as Phil Donahue,

17:42.133 --> 17:43.300
wouldn't change a thing.

17:43.300 --> 17:45.200
Hutch Bailey III
is the CEO

17:45.200 --> 17:48.133
and will be
until he decides otherwise.

17:48.133 --> 17:51.166
The Bailey family is YumTime.
YumTime is the Bailey family.

17:51.166 --> 17:53.233
As the majority of
the board of directors,

17:53.233 --> 17:55.166
you can change all of that
in an instant.

17:55.166 --> 17:59.100
Our chairman, Jerome Purkheiser,
is a wise and smart man.

17:59.100 --> 18:01.266
And he has been like
a second father to Hutch

18:01.266 --> 18:03.066
once Hutch II passed on.

18:03.066 --> 18:05.700
And I do not think Purk
would look upon this

18:05.700 --> 18:07.300
in a friendly way at all.

18:07.300 --> 18:08.433
So leave your letter.

18:08.433 --> 18:10.433
Put it on a billboard
if you want.

18:10.433 --> 18:11.767
This meeting's over.

18:11.767 --> 18:15.200
â™ª tense music â™ª

18:15.200 --> 18:18.567
So it's all about Purkheiser.
Now we know that for sure.

18:18.567 --> 18:21.033
-Yeah. Did you see her react?
-I did.

18:21.033 --> 18:22.734
[horn honks in distance]

18:22.734 --> 18:24.233
[woman] I am exposed here.
[sighs]

18:24.233 --> 18:26.367
This board seat gives me
my own standing

18:26.367 --> 18:28.166
and $200,000 in income.

18:28.166 --> 18:30.233
Seats are always at risk
during a takeover.

18:30.233 --> 18:31.734
You'll be fine.

18:31.734 --> 18:33.033
I don't wanna hear
those words from you

18:33.033 --> 18:35.066
until you divorce
Betty fucking Crocker.

18:35.066 --> 18:37.233
Cut the screen test, Evelyn.
Let me read the goddamn letter.

18:37.233 --> 18:38.667
[siren wailing in distance]

18:38.667 --> 18:41.200
Jesus, really?

18:41.200 --> 18:43.700
"Hutch Bailey has betrayed
the consumer and his own legacy

18:43.700 --> 18:46.500
by tampering
with the recipe"?

18:46.500 --> 18:48.266
The product tastes fine.

18:50.266 --> 18:52.533
This isn't about
the product.

18:55.266 --> 18:57.500
Bobby Axelrod knows about
you and me.

18:57.500 --> 18:59.600
What? How?

18:59.600 --> 19:03.200
[glass thuds]
-Not sure. But I'm impressed.

19:03.200 --> 19:05.233
He knows how important
your happiness is to me,

19:05.233 --> 19:09.266
so he's making us
his brushback pitch to my son.

19:09.266 --> 19:11.066
It's nice handiwork.

19:11.066 --> 19:13.033
We've got to stop it.

19:13.033 --> 19:15.667
He cannot get
on a winning streak.

19:15.667 --> 19:17.266
What are we gonna do?

19:17.266 --> 19:20.734
I gave you my board seat,
so I don't have a voice.

19:20.734 --> 19:24.333
But here's what you  can do.

19:24.333 --> 19:27.166
You can talk
to Jerome Purkheiser.

19:27.166 --> 19:28.500
And say what?

19:28.500 --> 19:31.133
You're a persuasive woman.

19:31.133 --> 19:35.166
Persuade him to ride
this thing out and block it.

19:35.166 --> 19:37.200
They're lobbying him.

19:37.200 --> 19:39.100
You should lobby him.

19:39.100 --> 19:41.333
Okay, I'll go talk to him.

19:41.333 --> 19:44.000
-Well, not now.
-Why not?

19:44.000 --> 19:45.367
Honey, I took a pill.

19:52.533 --> 19:56.000
[vehicles passing]

19:56.000 --> 19:59.166
[door closes]
-Hey, Lara.

19:59.166 --> 20:00.667
-Did you get it?
-Yep.

20:00.667 --> 20:04.066
How'd you do that so fast?

20:04.066 --> 20:05.600
I know an editor
at Goose Quill.

20:05.600 --> 20:07.133
His kid's a bass player,

20:07.133 --> 20:09.133
and I promised his band
a Pitchfork piece.

20:09.133 --> 20:10.400
Amazing.

20:10.400 --> 20:14.033
Hey, Lar. Wanna try a morel
and asparagus beggar's purse?

20:14.033 --> 20:15.266
Totally.

20:15.266 --> 20:17.266
Lu, Shari. Shari, Lu.

20:17.266 --> 20:19.100
Oh, the sister.

20:19.100 --> 20:20.533
Yeah, the sister. Hey.

20:20.533 --> 20:21.767
Eat that.

20:21.767 --> 20:26.000
â™ªâ™ªâ™ª

20:26.000 --> 20:28.166
Oh, my God. That is insane.

20:28.166 --> 20:29.600
She farms 'em, I charms 'em.

20:29.600 --> 20:31.133
I could eat that, like,
every day.

20:31.133 --> 20:33.100
That's my sis.

20:33.100 --> 20:35.767
So I skimmed.
I learned a thing or two.

20:35.767 --> 20:37.533
I didn't know Axe
was a doctor.

20:37.533 --> 20:39.400
A what?

20:39.400 --> 20:40.600
Stanford.

20:40.600 --> 20:42.567
Oh, the honorary.

20:42.567 --> 20:44.133
Yeah, we made
a pretty big gift.

20:44.133 --> 20:45.600
[dish clinks in distance]

20:45.600 --> 20:48.100
Lara, take a look
at chapter ten.

20:48.100 --> 20:50.633
It's a problem.

20:50.633 --> 20:53.300
[chair thuds]

20:53.300 --> 20:56.367
â™ª tense music â™ª

20:59.567 --> 21:01.266
[door closes]

21:01.266 --> 21:02.734
No, I'm -- I'm sure that
the kids will have

21:02.734 --> 21:04.166
a wonderful time.

21:04.166 --> 21:05.567
Listen, I really do
need to run.

21:05.567 --> 21:07.633
Yeah, okay. Bye.

21:07.633 --> 21:09.066
[receiver thuds]

21:09.066 --> 21:11.700
-Lonnie.
-Chuck. What's up?

21:11.700 --> 21:15.700
Uh, do you happen to catch
the science section on Tuesday?

21:15.700 --> 21:18.000
I may have skipped it.

21:18.000 --> 21:20.166
Mm. I never miss a word.

21:20.166 --> 21:23.500
Anyway, uh, there was a piece
on microbial research.

21:23.500 --> 21:25.233
It's a burgeoning field.

21:25.233 --> 21:28.300
And this MIT team was
looking into apoptosis.

21:28.300 --> 21:30.233
There are cells

21:30.233 --> 21:33.400
within me and you
and other complex organisms

21:33.400 --> 21:37.200
that will actually sacrifice
themselves for the whole.

21:37.200 --> 21:40.767
Healthy cells just kind of...
[chuckles]

21:40.767 --> 21:43.000
taking one for the team.

21:43.000 --> 21:44.734
What?

21:44.734 --> 21:47.066
Statue of Liberty
attempted bombing case

21:47.066 --> 21:48.100
needs to come off
your plate.

21:48.100 --> 21:50.000
I'm sorry?

21:50.000 --> 21:51.767
Eastern needs that case.

21:51.767 --> 21:54.633
No. That's a dagger.

21:54.633 --> 21:56.166
I have this.

21:56.166 --> 21:58.600
I've been doing this
for two years around the clock.

21:58.600 --> 22:01.200
Oh, believe me, I know,
and I see that.

22:01.200 --> 22:03.133
But it really can't
be helped.

22:03.133 --> 22:05.367
Besides, you're still
gonna be on the case.

22:05.367 --> 22:06.400
What the fuck?

22:06.400 --> 22:09.433
You're cross-designating me
to Eastern?

22:09.433 --> 22:11.467
Like you said, you've been
working on it for two years.

22:11.467 --> 22:14.066
They're gonna need
your expertise.

22:14.066 --> 22:16.000
Yeah, I'm gonna do
all the scut work.

22:16.000 --> 22:18.100
They're gonna try the case
and get the good stuff.

22:18.100 --> 22:19.500
I'll make it up to you.

22:19.500 --> 22:21.233
You gotta give me a reason.

22:21.233 --> 22:24.533
I'll making parly with Eastern
and I need big wampum.

22:24.533 --> 22:27.333
[sighs deeply]

22:27.333 --> 22:29.667
So I'm supposed to what,
just grab my ankles and take it?

22:29.667 --> 22:32.233
I'll send over a vat
of ass lube.

22:32.233 --> 22:34.266
[pats back]
-Chuck.

22:36.233 --> 22:38.100
What's the difference
between

22:38.100 --> 22:41.633
ass lube
or regular lube?

22:41.633 --> 22:43.367
Viscosity.

22:45.033 --> 22:47.066
-Fuck, Wend.
-[chuckling]

22:47.066 --> 22:48.767
I never get used
to how you live.

22:48.767 --> 22:51.500
Yeah.

22:51.500 --> 22:55.000
You know, I can see why you
made the choice that you did.

22:55.000 --> 22:57.467
E.R., it's binary.

22:57.467 --> 22:59.133
They come in
bleeding to death,

22:59.133 --> 23:02.367
I get them back on the rails
inside of a day.

23:02.367 --> 23:05.300
Or not.
Either way, it's done.

23:05.300 --> 23:08.333
I'm forced to move on
to the next, to be present.

23:08.333 --> 23:09.533
It's satisfying.

23:09.533 --> 23:11.266
I'm an adrenaline junkie
anyway.

23:11.266 --> 23:12.600
Well, we're both addicts.

23:12.600 --> 23:14.734
This thing I do...

23:14.734 --> 23:17.667
[scoffs] I get so fucking
turned on doing it

23:17.667 --> 23:21.433
because I see the change
happen immediately, too.

23:21.433 --> 23:25.033
They go from zero to 100,
and I can watch

23:25.033 --> 23:28.133
exactly how they use
what I give them.

23:28.133 --> 23:32.033
Yeah, but something about it
is not sitting right with you.

23:34.200 --> 23:36.533
You're in the horns
of a dilemma.

23:36.533 --> 23:39.767
Horns...of a...dilemma.

23:46.066 --> 23:47.767
There's this woman. [sighs]

23:47.767 --> 23:52.300
She's a real badass.
I like her a lot.

23:52.300 --> 23:55.300
And I know she's about
to get crushed,

23:55.300 --> 23:57.433
and the guy who's gonna
crush her is my patient, too.

23:59.266 --> 24:00.600
All these people
matter to me,

24:00.600 --> 24:02.567
and I can't do my job
if I judge them.

24:02.567 --> 24:03.600
Do the triage.

24:03.600 --> 24:07.033
Figure out who needs what more
and go that way.

24:07.033 --> 24:08.633
That's the short-term fix.

24:08.633 --> 24:12.033
Long term? This shit is gonna
give you ulceritis.

24:12.033 --> 24:14.533
-[scoffs]
-Worse.

24:14.533 --> 24:17.033
Talk to Chase,
the headhunter.

24:17.033 --> 24:19.467
Hmm. That guy you...

24:19.467 --> 24:21.734
Yeah, we had a little thing.
It was years ago.

24:21.734 --> 24:24.200
-You were kinda into him.
-Mm-hmm.

24:24.200 --> 24:25.700
He was...fun.

24:25.700 --> 24:29.400
Good at certain things,
if I recall.

24:29.400 --> 24:31.100
Very  conscientious.

24:31.100 --> 24:33.600
[laughing]

24:33.600 --> 24:35.333
[laughing]

24:35.333 --> 24:37.667
Someone's gotta talk
to Purkheiser.

24:37.667 --> 24:40.166
He made his money
in meat processing.

24:40.166 --> 24:41.734
Feared by the bovine.

24:41.734 --> 24:44.266
Kills over a million cows
a year.

24:44.266 --> 24:47.533
He's been described to me
as a cool-headed Midwesterner

24:47.533 --> 24:49.600
who can smell bullshit
in the colon of a bull

24:49.600 --> 24:50.700
from across the ranch.

24:50.700 --> 24:52.600
[scoffs] Wanna try him?

24:52.600 --> 24:54.600
I can't do that.
He's folksy.

24:54.600 --> 24:55.667
So?

24:55.667 --> 24:57.266
I've tried
with folksy people.

24:57.266 --> 24:59.333
They find me to be
a rapacious scumbag.

24:59.333 --> 25:02.633
I'm sorry to break it
to you, but...

25:02.633 --> 25:04.500
I don't think it's just
the folksy people.

25:04.500 --> 25:06.233
How 'bout you?

25:06.233 --> 25:09.200
You're my  rapacious scumbag.

25:09.200 --> 25:10.667
This is what love is.

25:13.600 --> 25:14.767
[Muzak playing
over telephone] â™ªâ™ª

25:14.767 --> 25:16.700
They put me
on fucking hold?

25:16.700 --> 25:18.633
Yeah, a man
of your stature.

25:18.633 --> 25:21.100
Damn right.
Man of my imperious --

25:21.100 --> 25:22.266
You ready to sweet talk me?

25:24.100 --> 25:26.567
Statue of Liberty
bombing attempt.

25:30.266 --> 25:31.633
I don't know.

25:31.633 --> 25:33.100
Oh, yes, you do.

25:33.100 --> 25:34.734
This story's front page
of the Times,

25:34.734 --> 25:36.567
above the fold,
and the case is solid.

25:36.567 --> 25:39.266
-One condition.
-Shoot.

25:39.266 --> 25:41.367
Ari Spyros
is embedded with you.

25:41.367 --> 25:43.633
No. No, no, no, no, no.

25:43.633 --> 25:47.233
No, you can't saddle me
with that useless douche bag.

25:47.233 --> 25:48.633
[mouths word]

25:48.633 --> 25:51.533
-Take or leave?
-Done.

25:51.533 --> 25:53.333
We'll send the transcript
right over.

25:53.333 --> 25:56.266
-Good.
-[Ari] Chuck, it's Ari.

25:56.266 --> 25:58.467
Looking forward
to working with you again.

25:58.467 --> 25:59.767
[inhales deeply]

25:59.767 --> 26:02.200
Hey. Spyros.

26:02.200 --> 26:04.000
I'm glad
you heard all that.

26:04.000 --> 26:07.533
And I promise, I'd have said
that to your fucking face,

26:07.533 --> 26:10.433
which always reminds me
of a confused dog.

26:13.266 --> 26:16.500
[children shout playfully,

playfully]

26:21.533 --> 26:22.667
[air brakes hiss]

26:22.667 --> 26:24.700
That's him.

26:24.700 --> 26:26.333
Seems like
a real family man.

26:26.333 --> 26:28.700
-Nice guy?
-What?

26:28.700 --> 26:29.734
I don't give a shit.

26:29.734 --> 26:31.166
Ah.

26:31.166 --> 26:32.433
"Good father? Fuck you."

26:32.433 --> 26:33.767
"Fuck you. Go home and play
with your kids."

[both chuckle]

26:37.433 --> 26:39.000
[boy speaks indistinctly]

26:39.000 --> 26:41.433
Okay, okay, okay. No.

26:41.433 --> 26:45.266
Actually, I feel a little bit
bad doing it this way.

26:45.266 --> 26:47.033
Yeah, me, too.
Let the kids clear.

26:49.166 --> 26:52.166
That's goddamn decent
of you.

26:52.166 --> 26:53.300
It's fucking hot.

26:55.300 --> 26:56.533
-[boy] All right, bye, Dad.
-[Pete] All right.

26:56.533 --> 26:58.033
-See you later, bud.
-Bye, Daddy. Love you.

26:58.033 --> 26:59.533
Love you, too.

26:59.533 --> 27:01.667
-All right, now.
-Go now.

[car doors open]

27:03.700 --> 27:06.300
[car doors close]

27:06.300 --> 27:08.333
Hi, Pete.

27:08.333 --> 27:09.500
â™ª slow-tempo electronic music â™ª

27:09.500 --> 27:11.200
Mr. Decker,

27:11.200 --> 27:12.500
Bryan Connerty

27:12.500 --> 27:14.066
with the U.S. Attorney's office,
Southern District.

27:14.066 --> 27:16.600
We have an awful lot
to talk about.

27:18.700 --> 27:21.333
â™ª slow-tempo music â™ª

27:21.333 --> 27:24.133
Okay. [sighs]

27:24.133 --> 27:27.066
It isn't flattering.

27:27.066 --> 27:29.600
Looking at some pretty serious
reputational damage here.

27:29.600 --> 27:31.000
Hmm, you think?

27:31.000 --> 27:33.734
Is it a defamation case?
I don't know. You tell me.

27:33.734 --> 27:35.533
How much is true?

27:35.533 --> 27:37.433
He made some shrewd trades
around 9/11.

27:37.433 --> 27:39.266
You know, he did what
he had to do.

27:39.266 --> 27:40.500
My husband plays hardball.

27:40.500 --> 27:42.734
Nobody makes billions of
dollars pitching underhand.

27:42.734 --> 27:46.567
But his work situation
beforehand, what he did after,

27:46.567 --> 27:48.200
incendiary.

27:48.200 --> 27:50.500
[dishes clatter]

27:50.500 --> 27:53.100
So what do you recommend?

27:53.100 --> 27:54.700
Three avenues --

27:54.700 --> 27:57.467
let her print,
then we rebut and sue.

27:57.467 --> 27:59.266
And I'm not
recommending that.

27:59.266 --> 28:01.233
People remember allegations,
not rebuttals.

28:01.233 --> 28:03.367
Exactly. Someone says
Charlie fucked a goat,

28:03.367 --> 28:04.567
even if the goat denies it,

28:04.567 --> 28:07.100
he goes to the grave
"Charlie the goat fucker."

28:07.100 --> 28:08.333
Second option --

28:08.333 --> 28:10.700
buy the publishing company
and kill it.

28:10.700 --> 28:12.767
That's too loud, I think.

28:12.767 --> 28:15.266
Agreed.

28:15.266 --> 28:16.700
The third choice --

28:16.700 --> 28:20.000
I could go and try
and reason with her.

28:20.000 --> 28:22.266
[chuckles]

28:22.266 --> 28:26.767
No, I reasoned with that twat
once before. [exhales]

28:28.266 --> 28:32.000
I have ways to get
her attention.

28:32.000 --> 28:34.533
Hi. I'm in the 8:15
with Steffi.

28:34.533 --> 28:36.233
Um, I don't have you
on my list.

28:36.233 --> 28:38.066
I booked online.

28:38.066 --> 28:39.066
There must be
some sort of mix up.

28:39.066 --> 28:40.300
Your name didn't make it
into the system.

28:40.300 --> 28:41.533
-Okay.
-Hey, June.

28:41.533 --> 28:42.633
Um...

28:42.633 --> 28:44.433
Lilly, Jane, Patricia...
you're all set.

28:44.433 --> 28:47.266
[woman] Thanks, Christine.
I gotta change.

28:47.266 --> 28:49.166
Um, can you just, like,
squeeze me in?

28:49.166 --> 28:51.400
Sorry. It's policy.

28:51.400 --> 28:52.600
Everything okay, June?

28:52.600 --> 28:55.600
Yeah, everything's fine.
I -- oh, God.

28:55.600 --> 29:00.200
[chuckles] A doctor.
I totally forgot. I'm late.

29:00.200 --> 29:02.400
[sighs heavily]

29:02.400 --> 29:03.266
They're on their way.

29:03.266 --> 29:04.333
-Good.
[door closes]

29:04.333 --> 29:06.266
Are you wearing cologne?

29:06.266 --> 29:08.667
-Yeah.
-Jesus Christ.

29:08.667 --> 29:10.533
So...ground rules.

29:10.533 --> 29:13.333
I'll do
all of the talking.

29:13.333 --> 29:16.300
"We have someone else that made
the same pharmaceutical trade."

29:16.300 --> 29:18.300
First one in
gets a lollipop.

29:18.300 --> 29:20.467
But to be clear,
we don't really have anyone?

29:20.467 --> 29:22.567
To be clear,
I am making a play.

29:22.567 --> 29:25.266
That's what I like to call
"the prisoner's dilemma."

29:25.266 --> 29:28.166
No, you don't like to call it
that. That's what it's called.

29:28.166 --> 29:30.633
Started as a thought experiment,
game theory in the '50s.

29:30.633 --> 29:32.700
Does no one ever check you
on this bullshit?

29:32.700 --> 29:35.166
I'm just saying, I would've
made the same play.

29:35.166 --> 29:38.066
[door opens]
-[woman] Mr. Decker, sir?

29:39.166 --> 29:40.367
[clears throat]

29:40.367 --> 29:42.433
â™ª tense music â™ª

29:42.433 --> 29:44.467
I think everyone knows
why we're here.

29:44.467 --> 29:46.500
We're ready to listen.

29:46.500 --> 29:48.533
Well...

29:48.533 --> 29:51.500
we have you on
the Pepsum trade.

29:51.500 --> 29:52.767
You know that.

29:52.767 --> 29:56.333
So why don't you tell us
about how Bobby Axelrod

29:56.333 --> 30:00.467
funneled you and other
satellites insider information?

30:00.467 --> 30:03.467
You're saying words
I don't understand.

30:03.467 --> 30:04.734
-Never gonna happen.
-What he's saying is,

30:04.734 --> 30:08.266
at this time, he does not
wish to cooperate.

30:08.266 --> 30:11.767
That's because he doesn't know
what we have up our sleeve.

30:11.767 --> 30:13.000
Sleeves.

30:16.300 --> 30:19.433
Mr. Decker, approximately
two and a half hours ago,

30:19.433 --> 30:21.734
we had someone sitting
where you are now --

30:21.734 --> 30:24.266
a young man from a fund that
I'm not at liberty to name,

30:24.266 --> 30:27.500
and he was downright chatty.
[exhales]

30:27.500 --> 30:29.033
So it looks
like the race is on

30:29.033 --> 30:31.567
to see who's got
the stronger information

30:31.567 --> 30:33.467
and who I'm gonna let
take the credit

30:33.467 --> 30:35.100
for flipping
on Bobby Axelrod.

30:35.100 --> 30:38.633
And the winner
gets to stay out of MCC.

30:38.633 --> 30:41.400
Yes, that's correct.

30:41.400 --> 30:43.066
Cooperate and go home.

30:43.066 --> 30:44.400
Uh, but this comes to trial,

30:44.400 --> 30:46.667
and you're talking
to your kids through glass.

30:46.667 --> 30:48.767
We'll see how that
all works out.

30:48.767 --> 30:50.300
Yes, we will.

30:50.300 --> 30:52.100
We're done here.

30:52.100 --> 30:55.333
Oh, you are far from done.

30:55.333 --> 30:56.700
Just know that.

31:02.166 --> 31:03.767
[door opens]

31:05.266 --> 31:07.767
[door closes]
-[sighs]

31:09.467 --> 31:11.767
-Fuck.
-I don't see him caving.

31:11.767 --> 31:14.100
Mm, I think he will.

31:14.100 --> 31:15.100
[laughs]

31:15.100 --> 31:18.100
You know, my fucking eyes
are watering here.

31:18.100 --> 31:20.133
How many pints of that
shitty toilet water

31:20.133 --> 31:22.467
do you splash on yourself
every morning, Spyros?

31:22.467 --> 31:25.133
You think maybe it's gonna
help you get some tail?

31:25.133 --> 31:28.266
Here's a tip -- it's not.

31:28.266 --> 31:31.266
[door opens]

31:31.266 --> 31:33.100
[door closes]

31:33.100 --> 31:35.567
It is a lot
in a confined area.

31:37.433 --> 31:41.266
-I cut back a little.
-Yeah, maybe cut way back.

31:45.166 --> 31:48.400
[horn honks in distance,
vehicles passing]

31:48.400 --> 31:51.333
[sports game playing on TV]

31:51.333 --> 31:54.400
-[smacks lips] So?
-It's a good slice of pizza.

31:54.400 --> 31:57.133
-Bruno.
-What is it, Bobby?

31:57.133 --> 31:59.300
Tell Mr. Purkheiser
why I love your sauce.

31:59.300 --> 32:01.066
Uh, I use the San Marzanos.

32:01.066 --> 32:02.300
-Tomatoes.
-Yeah, yeah, tomatoes.

32:02.300 --> 32:04.166
You make 'em without 'em,
it wouldn't taste right.

32:04.166 --> 32:05.300
Right. More expensive?

32:05.300 --> 32:06.433
Oh, yeah, yeah.

32:06.433 --> 32:08.633
But like I say,
it wouldn't taste right.

32:08.633 --> 32:10.066
Wouldn't be verace.

32:10.066 --> 32:11.133
Verace?

32:11.133 --> 32:13.734
The true way you make
a pizza Napoletana.

32:13.734 --> 32:16.000
This place is the pizza
of my youth.

32:16.000 --> 32:18.767
He's been making it just
like this since I was a kid.

32:18.767 --> 32:21.266
You know...
[clears throat]

32:21.266 --> 32:23.600
Normally, somebody wants
to waltz with me,

32:23.600 --> 32:26.200
I find myself sawing
a 20-ounce rib eye

32:26.200 --> 32:30.200
on the East Side
with a $500 cabernet.

32:30.200 --> 32:32.133
I am different
from the other children.

32:32.133 --> 32:36.033
Mm, well, that is clear now,
Mr. Axelrod.

32:36.033 --> 32:38.166
[clears throat]
When I was 11 years old

32:38.166 --> 32:41.200
till I was 14,
I was a paperboy.

32:41.200 --> 32:44.133
I delivered the Journal News
every day after school.

32:44.133 --> 32:46.033
And when I finished
my route,

32:46.033 --> 32:48.200
I'd pick up
a YumTime Scrumpet.

32:48.200 --> 32:50.600
It was my reward.

32:50.600 --> 32:53.600
I did this every weekday
for three years.

32:53.600 --> 32:56.767
And a while back,
I brought my two boys here.

32:56.767 --> 33:00.533
And I showed them my route,
we stopped for a Scrumpet,

33:00.533 --> 33:02.433
and they were colorless,

33:02.433 --> 33:05.500
over-sweet, petrified.

33:05.500 --> 33:08.533
Needless to say,
my two boys were underwhelmed.

33:08.533 --> 33:11.100
So was I.

33:11.100 --> 33:13.000
Didn't taste as good.

33:13.000 --> 33:14.433
So I did some research,

33:14.433 --> 33:17.333
and I learned that
the recipe had changed.

33:17.333 --> 33:19.734
Bruno!

33:19.734 --> 33:21.500
What's the name
of those tomatoes again?

33:21.500 --> 33:25.433
Uh, the San Marzanos.

33:25.433 --> 33:27.633
Bruno never let me down.

33:27.633 --> 33:29.367
YumTime let me down.

33:29.367 --> 33:31.700
Public company now.

33:31.700 --> 33:34.033
Gotta boost profits
for the shareholders.

33:34.033 --> 33:36.567
Synthetic ingredients
are cheaper, margins are better.

33:36.567 --> 33:38.700
Hutch III is playing
a quarterly game.

33:38.700 --> 33:40.100
It's just
a different world.

33:40.100 --> 33:42.767
Well, Hutch III is flying

33:42.767 --> 33:46.500
around that different world
in a G6.

33:46.500 --> 33:49.633
I'm guessing Hutches I and II
flew coach.

33:49.633 --> 33:51.600
It's classic,
time immemorial --

33:51.600 --> 33:53.667
Hutch I starts it,
Hutch II grows it,

33:53.667 --> 33:55.133
Hutch III blows it.

33:55.133 --> 33:58.066
Shirtsleeves to shirtsleeves
in three generations.

33:58.066 --> 34:01.433
Come on, Purk.
You have to see that.

34:02.767 --> 34:05.133
If you don't throw in with me
or someone like me,

34:05.133 --> 34:07.133
YumTime goes the same way
as Ebinger's.

34:07.133 --> 34:10.333
What's Ebinger's?

34:10.333 --> 34:13.667
That's exactly what
you wanted me to ask, isn't it?

34:15.700 --> 34:17.767
[indistinct conversations]

34:17.767 --> 34:19.667
-Hi, Mark.
-Ms. Raichlein.

34:19.667 --> 34:22.667
I have a 10:20 tee time, but we
wanna hit the range first.

34:22.667 --> 34:25.300
And I requested Stewart
on my bag.

34:25.300 --> 34:27.233
Yeah, um, Mr. Kellum from
the membership committee

34:27.233 --> 34:28.333
wanted to speak with you.

34:28.333 --> 34:32.600
Oh, okay. Um... [huffs]
is he in his office?

34:32.600 --> 34:34.000
No, he stepped out.

34:34.000 --> 34:36.567
Well, then, I'll pop back in
after the round.

34:36.567 --> 34:38.433
I had to give away
your tee time.

34:38.433 --> 34:41.533
Uh, what are you talking about?

34:41.533 --> 34:42.667
I don't really know.

34:42.667 --> 34:44.667
Something about your account
being in arrears.

34:44.667 --> 34:47.033
[laughs]

34:47.033 --> 34:50.567
That is not true.
My bookkeeper... [scoffs]

34:50.567 --> 34:52.000
There has been a mistake.

34:52.000 --> 34:54.567
Well, you can't play golf
till it's been resolved.

34:54.567 --> 34:57.200
[sighs]

35:01.200 --> 35:03.433
[pounds on table]
-Meeting to order.

35:03.433 --> 35:06.266
Let the record reflect
that two guests are present --

35:06.266 --> 35:08.300
Mr. Robert Axelrod,
shareholder,

35:08.300 --> 35:11.200
and Mr. Michael Wagner.
Welcome, gentlemen.

35:11.200 --> 35:14.367
Now I think we're all
familiar with Mr. Axelrod,

35:14.367 --> 35:17.333
by reputation and through
the letter that was circulated.

35:17.333 --> 35:19.300
And I feel that
this might be a good time

35:19.300 --> 35:22.133
to hear directly from him.
Mr. Axelrod?

35:22.133 --> 35:24.533
Thank you.

35:24.533 --> 35:27.066
Folks, my proposal is simple.

35:27.066 --> 35:28.600
Return to the original recipes

35:28.600 --> 35:30.734
and restore the YumTime brand
to its former glory.

35:30.734 --> 35:33.700
And then what?

35:33.700 --> 35:36.066
After a good quarter or two,
you spin it off?

35:37.734 --> 35:40.166
Do you see
what's happening here?

35:40.166 --> 35:43.200
This... [sighs] carpetbagger,
he comes in here,

35:43.200 --> 35:44.734
he shakes things up,

35:44.734 --> 35:46.633
he sells the company off
in pieces,

35:46.633 --> 35:49.100
and then he dumps his shares
the minute it ticks up.

35:49.100 --> 35:51.600
He's a raider,
plain and simple.

35:51.600 --> 35:53.266
Not my intention.

35:53.266 --> 35:54.734
Do you have any idea
of the cost

35:54.734 --> 35:56.600
of returning
to the old recipes?

35:56.600 --> 35:58.066
We can't remain competitive.

35:58.066 --> 35:59.600
Yes, sugar instead of
corn syrup,

35:59.600 --> 36:02.200
and the elimination of
polysorbate and other crap

36:02.200 --> 36:04.633
will add to the per unit cost
and cut into the margins.

36:04.633 --> 36:06.200
And destroy profits.

36:06.200 --> 36:08.266
How do we explain that
to the shareholders?

36:08.266 --> 36:11.633
No explanation necessary.

36:11.633 --> 36:15.166
We make up the difference
by streamlining in efficiencies

36:15.166 --> 36:18.533
and trimming bloated executive
compensation and perquisites,

36:18.533 --> 36:20.767
beginning with
the corporate jet.

36:20.767 --> 36:23.667
-Okay, you  have a jet.
-I earned a jet.

36:23.667 --> 36:25.166
I earned one, too.

36:25.166 --> 36:28.033
I started at the bottom.

36:28.033 --> 36:29.467
And the Scrumpets taste fine.

36:29.467 --> 36:31.767
You came on as
a 22-year-old vice president

36:31.767 --> 36:33.266
and you raped
the Scrumpet.

36:33.266 --> 36:35.266
I eat them.
I eat Scrumpets

36:35.266 --> 36:37.767
and Dingdoodles
and Kookoonutties,

36:37.767 --> 36:39.333
and they are good.

36:39.333 --> 36:40.767
They're not as  good.

36:40.767 --> 36:43.567
But they're still
very, very good. Delicious.

36:43.567 --> 36:45.100
Listen to me.

36:45.100 --> 36:48.734
I move that
effective immediately,

36:48.734 --> 36:51.667
Hutchinson Bailey III
be removed from his duties

36:51.667 --> 36:54.400
as Chief Executive Officer
of the YumTime corporation.

36:54.400 --> 36:57.100
Hang on a minute here!
Purk, you're being conned!

36:57.100 --> 36:58.667
[lowered voice] Jerome,
this is not what we discussed.

36:58.667 --> 37:01.300
Evelyn, there have been
subsequent discussions.

37:01.300 --> 37:02.500
Is there a second?

37:02.500 --> 37:04.100
Second.

37:04.100 --> 37:06.166
All those in favor?

37:06.166 --> 37:11.133
â™ª tense music â™ª

37:11.133 --> 37:12.433
Motion carries.

37:12.433 --> 37:14.734
â™ªâ™ªâ™ª

37:14.734 --> 37:17.600
You traitor.

37:17.600 --> 37:22.300
My father is turning
in his grave, I assure you.

37:22.300 --> 37:26.133
Your father thought
you were a lunkhead.

37:26.133 --> 37:27.633
â™ªâ™ªâ™ª

37:27.633 --> 37:31.066
Please, find the door.

37:31.066 --> 37:34.467
â™ªâ™ªâ™ª

37:34.467 --> 37:37.033
Fuck this.

37:37.033 --> 37:40.433
I'll get my company back...

37:40.433 --> 37:42.300
somehow.

37:44.734 --> 37:47.266
And fuck you, Axelrod.

37:47.266 --> 37:48.633
Well, now you're off
my Christmas list.

37:48.633 --> 37:49.700
[door opens]

37:49.700 --> 37:51.166
-I now move...
[door closes]

37:51.166 --> 37:54.033
...to remove Evelyn Benson
from this body

37:54.033 --> 37:56.066
and delegate her seat
to Robert Axelrod.

37:56.066 --> 37:58.033
-What?!
-[Lifson] Second.

37:58.033 --> 37:59.100
â™ª dance music â™ª

37:59.100 --> 38:00.600
I'll go to the press.

38:00.600 --> 38:02.000
If you do,

38:02.000 --> 38:04.433
you'll be burned down
with your own match.

38:04.433 --> 38:07.700
But if you don't, we'll write
you a nice endorsement,

38:07.700 --> 38:09.533
and maybe you'll get
another board.

38:09.533 --> 38:12.300
[sighs] You old cocksucker.

38:12.300 --> 38:13.300
â™ªâ™ªâ™ª

38:13.300 --> 38:15.633
The same might be said
of you, my dear.

38:15.633 --> 38:16.734
â™ªâ™ªâ™ª

38:16.734 --> 38:18.300
All those in favor?

38:18.300 --> 38:19.734
â™ªâ™ªâ™ª

38:19.734 --> 38:21.233
Motion carries.

38:21.233 --> 38:24.066
Good luck, Evelyn.

38:24.066 --> 38:27.066
â™ª slow-tempo
electronic dance music â™ª

38:32.767 --> 38:34.266
[door slams]

38:36.200 --> 38:39.467
They offered me
what I'm worth. Finally.

38:39.467 --> 38:43.133
[sighs] That's great.

38:43.133 --> 38:47.300
I leveraged the offer
from Zenobia capital.

38:47.300 --> 38:49.400
The kinder, gentler fund.

38:49.400 --> 38:50.567
What are they like?

38:50.567 --> 38:52.734
Good returns,
less assholey.

38:52.734 --> 38:56.100
Less assholey is good.

38:56.100 --> 38:58.233
Okay. Talk to me.

38:58.233 --> 39:00.100
-You have time?
-Yeah, come on.

39:00.100 --> 39:01.266
All right.

39:06.767 --> 39:08.333
[sighs]

39:08.333 --> 39:11.233
So the more I thought about
going over to Zenobia,

39:11.233 --> 39:14.033
the more excited I became
by the prospect.

39:14.033 --> 39:17.100
I mean, I'd have to build up
a book again, but...

39:17.100 --> 39:18.567
But there's
a growth opportunity.

39:18.567 --> 39:20.633
And a ticket out
of the boys' club.

39:20.633 --> 39:22.266
Yeah.

39:22.266 --> 39:23.734
But then, uh...

39:23.734 --> 39:27.100
Wags --
he really stepped up.

39:27.100 --> 39:30.233
He was respectful,

39:30.233 --> 39:33.367
endearing...almost.

39:35.100 --> 39:36.266
Yeah, it's kinda weird,

39:36.266 --> 39:41.000
but it gave rise
to a sense of loyalty.

39:41.000 --> 39:42.333
Go figure, right?

39:42.333 --> 39:45.400
He's an enigma.

39:45.400 --> 39:50.066
So now
I'm in a dilemma again.

39:50.066 --> 39:53.467
Yep. The horns.

39:55.400 --> 39:57.000
Close your eyes.

39:57.000 --> 39:59.533
[sighs]

40:02.000 --> 40:04.633
Picture yourself...

40:04.633 --> 40:08.033
at 80 years old.

40:08.033 --> 40:10.133
You're at
your Sag Harbor place,

40:10.133 --> 40:14.400
on the front porch
in a rocking chair.

40:14.400 --> 40:17.500
See the view.

40:17.500 --> 40:21.433
Hear the sound of the water,
the seagulls.

40:23.300 --> 40:27.166
Feel the summer breeze.

40:27.166 --> 40:29.233
And feel the arm
of the chair

40:29.233 --> 40:33.066
as you slowly rock.

40:33.066 --> 40:35.033
Now reflect on your life

40:35.033 --> 40:38.767
having decided to stay here
at Axe Capital.

40:38.767 --> 40:42.033
Your relationships here,

40:42.033 --> 40:46.767
your chances...to advance,

40:46.767 --> 40:51.000
to be fulfilled.

40:51.000 --> 40:52.000
[exhales slowly]

40:52.000 --> 40:54.533
What are your days like?

40:54.533 --> 41:00.033
â™ª pensive music â™ª

41:00.033 --> 41:01.734
Now...

41:01.734 --> 41:05.333
picture yourself having
spent that time with Zenobia.

41:05.333 --> 41:07.500
â™ªâ™ªâ™ª

41:07.500 --> 41:10.166
Who are you with?

41:10.166 --> 41:13.400
What are your days like?

41:13.400 --> 41:17.667
Were you able to rise?

41:17.667 --> 41:21.266
â™ªâ™ªâ™ª

41:21.266 --> 41:24.333
Did you become
a better version of yourself?

41:24.333 --> 41:26.734
[inhales deeply]

41:26.734 --> 41:29.233
[exhales slowly]

41:29.233 --> 41:32.467
â™ªâ™ªâ™ª

41:32.467 --> 41:35.233
Take your time.

41:35.233 --> 41:38.533
[breathing heavily]
I'm sorry. I'm...

41:38.533 --> 41:40.333
I'm having trouble
breathing here.

41:40.333 --> 41:44.767
I-I-I don't understand.
My solar plexus is collapsing.

41:44.767 --> 41:47.500
What do you mean
there is no place for him?

41:47.500 --> 41:51.033
His father, who died tragically,
went to Stanford.

41:51.033 --> 41:54.433
And so did his grandfather, who
has his name on a squash court.

41:54.433 --> 41:57.367
He plays the goddamn violin.

41:57.367 --> 41:59.667
This is a double legacy
with perfect SATs

41:59.667 --> 42:03.567
who goes into Bridgeport
to read to poor, dumb children!

42:03.567 --> 42:05.533
I mean,
what the fuck happened?!

42:05.533 --> 42:08.400
[man] June, you know how sorry
we are about this.

42:08.400 --> 42:11.000
This is just
a very competitive class.

42:11.000 --> 42:13.767
What about a gap year?
Or what is his safety school?

42:13.767 --> 42:18.367
His safety school
is fuck you! [grunts]

42:18.367 --> 42:20.233
[crying]

42:20.233 --> 42:22.467
[horn blaring]

42:22.467 --> 42:24.100
I hate that cunt!

42:24.100 --> 42:26.500
I hate that cunt!
I hate that cunt!

42:26.500 --> 42:28.266
-I hate that cunt!
[horn continues blaring ]

42:28.266 --> 42:29.734
I hate that cunt!

42:29.734 --> 42:32.100
[Chuck] Dad?

42:32.100 --> 42:34.400
In my office.

42:34.400 --> 42:36.533
Hi. Where's Mom?

42:36.533 --> 42:38.066
Hair appointment.

42:38.066 --> 42:40.667
I'm taking her out tonight to
Grenouille for our anniversary.

42:40.667 --> 42:41.633
Mm.

42:41.633 --> 42:44.000
But she set us up
with some gazpacho.

42:44.000 --> 42:45.400
[clicks tongue]

42:45.400 --> 42:48.133
She made some guacamole
as well.

42:48.133 --> 42:50.767
Avocado's a superfood.

42:50.767 --> 42:52.066
Hmm?

42:55.166 --> 42:57.767
YumTime
and Bobby fucking Axelrod.

42:57.767 --> 42:59.400
This is aimed at you.

42:59.400 --> 43:01.066
How is that?

43:01.066 --> 43:04.367
He's sending you a message,
showing you his reach.

43:04.367 --> 43:08.300
[chuckles] That he knows
my father has a mistress?

43:08.300 --> 43:11.133
Don't use that word here,
and yes.

43:11.133 --> 43:13.734
If he can take away her board
seat just to fuck with me...

43:13.734 --> 43:17.166
Then he can get to me
a million other ways, Dad.

43:17.166 --> 43:19.233
[chuckles] I've dealt
with the Russians.

43:19.233 --> 43:21.133
-I think I can handle this.
-Can you?

43:21.133 --> 43:24.433
What the fuck do you want me
to do about it?

43:24.433 --> 43:26.567
He made
a legal business play,

43:26.567 --> 43:28.233
and, uh, that's costing you
some headaches,

43:28.233 --> 43:29.400
which is too fucking bad.

43:29.400 --> 43:31.433
It's gonna cost me
$200,000 in upkeep

43:31.433 --> 43:36.000
is what it's gonna cost me,
but you  have to ask yourself...

43:36.000 --> 43:38.166
-[crunching]
-What is he gonna attack next?

43:38.166 --> 43:40.467
â™ª tense music â™ª

43:40.467 --> 43:42.667
-Now find a way...
-[exhales deeply]

43:42.667 --> 43:44.567
...to bury
the son of a bitch.

43:44.567 --> 43:48.567
I am, but on my timetable,
not yours.

43:48.567 --> 43:51.066
Your timetable
will have me watching

43:51.066 --> 43:54.467
your gubernatorial campaign
from my fucking mausoleum.

43:54.467 --> 43:58.133
I have to do this job
right first

43:58.133 --> 44:00.166
before I even have a chance
at the next one.

44:00.166 --> 44:04.333
Ah, agreement. We both wish
you'd do your fucking job now.

44:04.333 --> 44:06.467
Guac is starting to turn.

44:06.467 --> 44:09.700
Uh...

44:09.700 --> 44:11.567
Tell your mail carrier
that, uh,

44:11.567 --> 44:14.300
I'm terribly sorry
about her board seat.

44:14.300 --> 44:17.333
And tell Mom, your wife,

44:17.333 --> 44:20.433
that I said
happy anniversary.

44:20.433 --> 44:28.000

â™ªYou've got me, girl,

44:45.767 --> 44:47.500
[Wags] There she goes.

44:47.500 --> 44:48.533
Yep.

44:48.533 --> 44:51.100
â™ªThen you look no furtherâ™ª

44:51.100 --> 44:52.367
I really am gonna miss
her energy.

44:52.367 --> 44:55.166
â™ªFor I'm gonna be your onlyâ™ª

44:55.166 --> 44:58.233

[door closes]

45:11.300 --> 45:13.000
Off to the Yankees game?

45:13.000 --> 45:14.300
Don Pasquale.

45:14.300 --> 45:17.367
Ah. Ambrogio Maestri.

45:17.367 --> 45:19.400
I heard his Falstaff.

45:19.400 --> 45:20.767
You're in for a real treat.

45:20.767 --> 45:22.400
So Decker's parents --

45:22.400 --> 45:25.667
a retired eighth grade teacher
and a sales clerk --

45:25.667 --> 45:27.734
their net worth is
eight figures.

45:27.734 --> 45:30.600
But all of their statements
go to their son's address.

45:32.533 --> 45:35.734
Decker personally trades
their accounts.

45:35.734 --> 45:39.266
Which kind of puts them
in his leaky boat.

45:39.266 --> 45:40.667
What are they like?

45:40.667 --> 45:43.033
Total straight and narrow,
church-going conservatives.

45:43.033 --> 45:44.567
[exhales sharply]

45:44.567 --> 45:47.266
Well, that's a tidy
leverage opportunity.

45:47.266 --> 45:49.133
â™ª tense music â™ª

45:49.133 --> 45:52.567
I wonder if the parents
even know about it.

45:52.567 --> 45:54.600
They could be
totally innocent here.

45:54.600 --> 45:57.000
Do we really wanna do 'em
like this?

45:57.000 --> 45:59.367
â™ªâ™ªâ™ª

45:59.367 --> 46:03.433
We apply pressure
where and when we can.

46:03.433 --> 46:05.533
Now he made them vulnerable,
not us.

46:05.533 --> 46:08.700
We're just hitting
the hole in the line.

46:08.700 --> 46:10.300
Right.

46:10.300 --> 46:12.367
How'd you come up
with that?

46:12.367 --> 46:13.500
Just thought about
what I would do

46:13.500 --> 46:15.100
if I were a trader
in his position,

46:15.100 --> 46:16.433
how I would hide
some of the money.

46:16.433 --> 46:18.333
The Swiss banks are watched
too closely now.

46:18.333 --> 46:19.734
He doesn't trust his wife,

46:19.734 --> 46:24.233
and, uh, his parents aren't
sophisticated investors.

46:24.233 --> 46:25.533
-Good hunch.
[folder thuds]

46:25.533 --> 46:27.367
Yeah, what are you
working on right now?

46:27.367 --> 46:28.500
Internet fraud case.

46:28.500 --> 46:31.200
Ah. I bet
that's fucking boring.

46:31.200 --> 46:34.066
[chuckles] No, it's --
I mean, it's not, um...

46:34.066 --> 46:36.000
Yeah, actually, it is.
It's fucking boring.

46:36.000 --> 46:38.734
[chuckles] Why don't you
skip Don Pasquale

46:38.734 --> 46:41.400
and join us on this opera buffa?
What do you say?

46:41.400 --> 46:43.266
Fuck, yes.

46:43.266 --> 46:47.300
â™ªâ™ªâ™ª

46:47.300 --> 46:49.367
Hi, June. Come on in.

46:49.367 --> 46:51.233
No, um, I can't say,

46:51.233 --> 46:54.000
but thanks
for making some time.

46:54.000 --> 46:56.200
I realized
that I skipped a step.

46:56.200 --> 46:59.400
[chuckles] I didn't show you
the manuscript.

46:59.400 --> 47:03.033
This is a revised version.

47:03.033 --> 47:05.600
I, um, I cut a chapter,

47:05.600 --> 47:09.066
and I made some minor edits
here and there.

47:09.066 --> 47:11.734
And I would be curious
to hear your opinion.

47:13.367 --> 47:16.100
Great.
Can't wait to read it.

47:16.100 --> 47:18.734
Great. Thanks.

47:18.734 --> 47:22.200
[insects chirping in distance]

47:22.200 --> 47:24.533
And, um, if you would

47:24.533 --> 47:28.100
like me to
sign a nondisclosure

47:28.100 --> 47:30.133
about the stuff
that I cut...

47:30.133 --> 47:31.233
Would you?

47:34.633 --> 47:37.166
That would be lovely.
Thank you.

47:37.166 --> 47:39.600
[exhales]

47:39.600 --> 47:42.633
Oh, and, June, I spoke to
Carl Belanger at Stanford...

47:42.633 --> 47:44.133
The president.

47:44.133 --> 47:46.133
Yeah, and, um, there seems
to be a mix-up.

47:46.133 --> 47:47.433
A mix-up?

47:47.433 --> 47:49.700
Yeah, the weighting they
gave certain categories

47:49.700 --> 47:52.533
of your son's application,
they were inputted incorrectly.

47:52.533 --> 47:56.100
And I believe corrections
are being made.

47:56.100 --> 47:59.266
I have a very good feeling
that he'll get accepted.

47:59.266 --> 48:00.266
Congratulations.

Really? This makes
cattle concentrate.

48:49.066 --> 48:51.066

this keeps you in the present.

48:51.066 --> 48:52.433
Yeah.

Are you okay?

48:55.233 --> 48:58.633
Oh, there's, um...

Oh, God. I can't believe
I'm even talking about this.

-And?
-She made some cuts.

50:55.367 --> 50:56.533
At your suggestion?

50:56.533 --> 50:58.767
She was resistant at first,
