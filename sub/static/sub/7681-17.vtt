01:19.667 --> 01:23.706
Death is a guarantee
from the day we're born.

01:24.166 --> 01:25.702
But somehow
you forget about it,

01:25.709 --> 01:28.155
figure it'll never happen,

01:28.166 --> 01:30.703
at least not to you
or the people you care about.

01:31.166 --> 01:32.702
But it does.

02:07.208 --> 02:09.199
Jack Dalton never believed

02:09.750 --> 02:11.206
that anyone
or anything could put him away.

02:11.208 --> 02:13.199
There wasn't a situation

02:13.208 --> 02:14.744
he couldn't cheat
his way out of.

02:14.750 --> 02:16.741
He always had a plan...

02:18.208 --> 02:19.197
...until now.

02:22.750 --> 02:25.241
And it was no different
the last time I saw him.

02:25.250 --> 02:26.740
So what's the deal?

02:26.750 --> 02:28.741
Papa Thornton say you can
come out and play or what?

02:28.750 --> 02:30.240
Yeah.

02:30.250 --> 02:31.239
Good.

02:31.250 --> 02:33.741
Now we go to plane, Kimosabe.

02:33.750 --> 02:34.739
You follow.

02:35.250 --> 02:37.241
He was always dragging me

02:37.250 --> 02:38.740
into some half-baked plan

02:38.750 --> 02:40.741
designed to get him out
of trouble.

02:40.750 --> 02:43.787
I never could just say no
to him.

02:44.250 --> 02:46.787
Midnight border crossing
in a 40-year-old airplane

02:46.792 --> 02:50.785
with a questionable compass,
no charts

02:50.792 --> 02:53.249
and total radio silence
was typical Jack Dalton.

02:53.250 --> 02:55.787
Shouldn't we be using charts
or something?!

03:14.792 --> 03:15.781
Charts!

03:15.792 --> 03:17.282
Shouldn't we be using charts!

03:17.291 --> 03:18.781
what's the name
on the plane, Mac?

03:18.792 --> 03:20.282
"Fly By Night."

03:20.792 --> 03:22.282
Exactly. Now relax,

03:22.291 --> 03:24.282
I know what I'm doing.

03:37.834 --> 03:40.826
Ah, Jack,

03:40.834 --> 03:44.326
you could have
at least said good-bye.

03:44.333 --> 03:45.823
I never even got to thank you

03:46.333 --> 03:48.324
for saving my life
in Central America.

03:49.333 --> 03:51.324
I know you were kind of a...

03:51.834 --> 03:53.825
pain in the neck sometimes...

03:58.333 --> 04:00.324
Jack, wouldn't you say
we're running out of runway?

04:00.333 --> 04:02.324
Ah, you worry too much, Mac.

04:05.333 --> 04:07.870
Sometimes you don't worry
enough.

04:08.333 --> 04:08.867
Hang on, Mac.

04:09.333 --> 04:10.869
I'm bringin' her around.

04:17.875 --> 04:19.331
what was that?

04:19.875 --> 04:21.866
Tricks o' me trade,
Mac, me boyo.

04:21.875 --> 04:22.864
Tricks o' me trade.

04:34.375 --> 04:35.865
Beautiful! Mac,
I got to tell ya,

04:35.875 --> 04:37.866
it brought tears
to my eyes.

04:37.875 --> 04:38.864
Beautiful! Now tell me

04:39.375 --> 04:41.366
you're not havin' just
a little bit of fun!

04:45.917 --> 04:47.908
Yeah, that was you, Jack,

04:48.375 --> 04:50.912
always having just a little bit
of fun.

04:51.375 --> 04:53.366
Problem was, you could never
leave well enough alone.

04:53.375 --> 04:57.368
You always had
to take it one step too far.

04:57.375 --> 04:58.911
Jack!

04:58.917 --> 05:00.908
MacGyver!

05:00.917 --> 05:02.908
I'm flattered.
You came.

05:02.917 --> 05:05.408
I had a choice?

05:06.917 --> 05:08.908
Yo, Mack,

05:08.917 --> 05:09.906
where you goin'?

05:09.917 --> 05:11.407
Oh, you're not steamed, are you?

05:11.417 --> 05:12.406
Come on, it was a joke!

05:12.917 --> 05:13.906
First, you're gonna
come down here,

05:13.917 --> 05:15.908
so I can punch you in the nose.

05:16.417 --> 05:17.907
Then you're gonna load up
all my stuff

05:17.917 --> 05:18.906
and take it back to my place.

05:18.917 --> 05:20.407
You got that?

05:20.417 --> 05:21.406
All-All right, I'm sorry.

05:21.417 --> 05:22.907
If that's what you want,
I'll put it all back.

05:22.917 --> 05:24.407
Good.
Hey, Mac, please,

05:24.959 --> 05:25.414
please don't go.
where you goin'?

05:25.959 --> 05:26.948
Mac, I'm beggin' you.

05:26.959 --> 05:27.414
Mac! whoa!

05:27.417 --> 05:28.406
Jack!

05:28.417 --> 05:29.406
Ooh-ee!

05:31.959 --> 05:33.415
You should see your face.

05:34.959 --> 05:35.948
Priceless!

05:35.959 --> 05:37.415
Oh, Mac, you haven't changed.

05:37.417 --> 05:38.953
Not a bit!

05:38.959 --> 05:39.948
Neither have you, Jack.

05:40.417 --> 05:41.406
Yeah, thanks.

05:41.417 --> 05:43.408
It wasn't a compliment.

05:43.417 --> 05:44.953
Hey, Mac, you got
to cut me down. Mac!

05:45.458 --> 05:47.449
Mac, cut me down!

05:47.458 --> 05:48.447
Come on, MacGyver!

05:48.458 --> 05:50.949
My head's about
to explode here!

05:50.959 --> 05:53.450
Ah! Oh, I knew you wouldn'
t leave me hangin'.

05:53.458 --> 05:55.449
You could call me
amigo anytime.

05:55.458 --> 05:57.449
If there's ever anything
I can do for you,

05:57.959 --> 05:59.950
just let me know...
amigo.

06:00.959 --> 06:01.948
Now easy, easy.

06:01.959 --> 06:03.449
Hey, wa-watch my head!

06:08.458 --> 06:11.450
You know, I never got
to tell you that...

06:28.500 --> 06:29.990
I hate seeing him
when he looks like this.

06:31.001 --> 06:32.992
And, uh,

06:33.500 --> 06:35.991
and I wonder
if you could all excuse me

06:36.001 --> 06:37.992
for just a few minutes.

06:38.001 --> 06:40.492
I'd like to spend a couple
of minutes

06:40.500 --> 06:42.491
alone with him
to say good-bye.

06:44.000 --> 06:45.991
Hope you
understand.

06:46.000 --> 06:47.490
Thank you.

06:49.500 --> 06:51.491
we were very close.

07:04.000 --> 07:06.992
I suppose I could have
been wrong about what I saw.

07:07.000 --> 07:09.537
Sure, Jack's left eye used
to always twitch

07:09.542 --> 07:11.999
when he was lying,
but that was when he was alive.

07:12.000 --> 07:13.991
Now...

07:16.542 --> 07:19.989
Nah, not even Jack
could be low enough

07:20.000 --> 07:21.536
to lie about something
like this.

07:26.041 --> 07:28.032
Jack?

07:31.041 --> 07:32.531
Jack!

07:35.041 --> 07:36.030
You're alive!

07:38.041 --> 07:39.531
Jack, what are
you up to now?!

07:40.041 --> 07:41.030
Easy, easy.

07:41.041 --> 07:43.032
You're making enough noise
to wake the dead.

07:43.041 --> 07:45.032
If you don't get out of
this coffin right now,

07:45.041 --> 07:46.577
you're gonna wish you were dead!

07:46.583 --> 07:48.574
If I get out of this coffin,
I probablywillbe dead.

07:49.041 --> 07:50.577
How can you
do this to me?

07:50.583 --> 07:52.574
Let me stand here watching
you laying there like that?

07:53.041 --> 07:54.030
Come on, MacGyver,
watch the duds.

07:54.041 --> 07:56.032
I got to get 'em back by 3:00.

07:56.041 --> 07:57.577
It's big prom night.

07:57.583 --> 07:59.039
I got a rate.

07:59.041 --> 08:01.032
Jack, how could you do this?

08:01.583 --> 08:02.572
No biggie.

08:02.583 --> 08:03.572
Hire some bums
to mourn me.

08:03.583 --> 08:04.572
Pick some nice organ music.

08:05.083 --> 08:07.574
Find a coffin that...

08:07.583 --> 08:09.574
I don't want you
to get mixed up in this, Mac.

08:09.583 --> 08:10.572
But it's great to see you.

08:12.583 --> 08:15.575
Now, would you mind leaving?

08:39.625 --> 08:41.081
All right, Jack, I want to know
what's goin' on.

08:41.625 --> 08:42.080
what are you up to?

08:42.625 --> 08:43.614
I'm undercover.

08:44.125 --> 08:45.615
Special assignment with the CIA.

08:45.625 --> 08:46.614
As a corpse?

08:47.125 --> 08:48.114
Enough, Jack.

08:48.125 --> 08:49.615
No.

08:49.625 --> 08:51.115
The other side broke my cover.

08:51.125 --> 08:52.615
I figured I had to lay low
for awhile.

08:52.625 --> 08:54.616
This was the only plan I had.

08:54.625 --> 08:56.115
Don't you think six feet under

08:56.625 --> 08:58.115
is taking laying low
a little far?

09:00.625 --> 09:02.115
when guys like that
want you dead,

09:02.125 --> 09:03.615
you can't get low enough.

09:03.625 --> 09:04.660
Mourners?

09:04.667 --> 09:05.656
They'd like to be!

09:06.125 --> 09:07.114
Let's go!

09:07.667 --> 09:09.123
Next time,
I'm just sending flowers.

09:10.667 --> 09:12.123
Come on! Come on!

09:12.125 --> 09:14.116
what?!

09:14.667 --> 09:16.123
Jack!

09:18.667 --> 09:20.658
Al!

09:24.166 --> 09:26.157
Come on, this way.

09:29.166 --> 09:30.656
Hi-yo Silver, away!

09:47.709 --> 09:49.165
All right, Jack, let's have it!

09:49.166 --> 09:52.158
who have you cheated,
swindled or robbed this time?

09:52.166 --> 09:54.157
why do you always have
to think the worst?

09:54.709 --> 09:56.165
I'm an honest businessman now.

09:56.166 --> 09:57.702
I run an honest business.

09:57.709 --> 09:59.700
Jack-Be-Quick Messenger Service.

09:59.709 --> 10:02.155
So what's that got to do
with this little game

10:02.166 --> 10:04.202
of spy versus spy
you think you're playing?

10:04.208 --> 10:05.197
It's the truth!

10:05.709 --> 10:06.698
I was doing an honest
day's work.

10:06.709 --> 10:08.700
Pick up and deliver.

10:08.709 --> 10:10.700
Is it my fault nobody told me

10:10.709 --> 10:13.200
I was delivering top secret
government documents?

10:13.208 --> 10:14.698
who to?

10:15.208 --> 10:16.197
The other side.

10:16.208 --> 10:17.197
Them!

10:17.208 --> 10:20.200
The other side?!

10:20.208 --> 10:21.197
Them?!

10:28.750 --> 10:30.741
These guys know
what they're doing!

10:30.750 --> 10:33.207
Now you know why I wanted
to play dead for a while.

10:33.208 --> 10:34.744
They think I know too much.

10:34.750 --> 10:36.741
They think I finked to the CIA.

10:36.750 --> 10:38.741
Did you?

10:38.750 --> 10:39.205
Of course.

10:39.750 --> 10:40.739
There were these two agents

10:40.750 --> 10:41.739
who already knew
what I was doing.

10:41.750 --> 10:44.241
They asked me
to keep on making deliveries

10:44.250 --> 10:46.741
until they could track down
their leak inside the CIA.

10:53.750 --> 10:55.240
we got 'em!

10:55.250 --> 10:57.241
Now they'll have to slow
down for the traffic.

10:58.750 --> 11:00.240
They're catching up!

11:05.250 --> 11:06.786
Go straight

11:06.792 --> 11:08.248
across the street!

11:08.250 --> 11:09.786
But the alley's
blocked down there!

11:09.792 --> 11:10.781
I know it's blocked!

11:10.792 --> 11:11.781
Just hit the brake

11:11.792 --> 11:14.249
and follow me
when I say stop!

11:14.250 --> 11:15.239
whoa... whoa!

11:19.792 --> 11:20.781
we can't get through!

11:21.250 --> 11:22.239
There's no room!

11:22.250 --> 11:23.239
Now!

11:31.792 --> 11:34.784
Yahoo!

11:34.792 --> 11:36.282
Look out!

11:41.291 --> 11:42.280
Hold on, son!

11:42.291 --> 11:44.828
I got your training
wheels right here!

11:44.834 --> 11:46.825
You miss me?
I can't seem

11:46.834 --> 11:48.290
to get along without you.

11:49.291 --> 11:51.828
More fun
than a circus, huh?

11:54.291 --> 11:56.282
There it is:
home, sweet home!

11:56.834 --> 11:59.826
You're still chiseling space
in that building?

12:00.291 --> 12:01.280
where else?

12:01.291 --> 12:03.282
It's now corpora
te headquarters,

12:03.291 --> 12:04.827
and my luxury suite.

12:04.834 --> 12:06.324
I even have
my own private

12:06.834 --> 12:08.324
executive elevator.

12:08.333 --> 12:11.325
Yeah, some
executive elevator.

12:11.333 --> 12:13.824
This is your home
and your office?

12:13.834 --> 12:15.324
Yeah, it's two.

12:15.834 --> 12:16.823
Two? Two what?

12:17.333 --> 12:18.322
Two tax breaks in one.

12:18.333 --> 12:19.823
Looks great on the 1040.

12:19.834 --> 12:20.823
To the Bat Cave, Robin!

12:21.333 --> 12:23.324
Get a grip on that
claustrophobia, son.

12:23.333 --> 12:26.325
we have privacy, security,
all the comforts of home.

12:26.333 --> 12:27.869
It's not much of a view,

12:27.875 --> 12:29.866
but still, a bargain
for the money.

12:41.333 --> 12:42.869
Lower level:
men's furnishings,

12:42.875 --> 12:45.366
ladies' lingerie, Jack-Be-Quick
Messenger Service.

12:45.875 --> 12:46.864
Please watch your step.

12:52.875 --> 12:54.365
Nice.

12:54.375 --> 12:55.865
I never got around
to getting that maid.

12:56.375 --> 12:57.364
Now, what happened?

12:57.375 --> 12:59.366
I was sure you had crashed
in Central America

12:59.375 --> 13:01.366
after you flew off
with that crooked cop.

13:01.375 --> 13:03.366
well, I came this close.

13:03.375 --> 13:05.912
I tricked the cop into bailing
out with the drugs.

13:05.917 --> 13:07.373
Then I made a few
last-minute arrangements

13:07.917 --> 13:09.373
with the guy
at the big control tower.

13:09.375 --> 13:10.364
waited for the fuel to run out.

13:10.917 --> 13:12.373
Did it?
Yup.

13:12.375 --> 13:13.911
But just as I
was going down,

13:13.917 --> 13:15.908
this warm updraft,
like God's own hand,

13:15.917 --> 13:18.374
picked me up and carried me
right down the coast.

13:18.375 --> 13:19.364
I went down there.

13:19.917 --> 13:21.908
where? Right in the middle
of this native village.

13:21.917 --> 13:23.373
Mac, you wouldn't believe it.

13:23.375 --> 13:24.410
They were all women.

13:24.417 --> 13:25.907
They were all beautiful.

13:25.917 --> 13:27.407
Jack? I know

13:27.417 --> 13:29.408
you're lying
when your left eye blinks.

13:29.917 --> 13:30.906
Now, come on.

13:30.917 --> 13:33.909
Okay. Before I took you
to Central America,

13:33.917 --> 13:35.908
my doctor said
I'd be lucky to last a month.

13:35.917 --> 13:38.408
So, after I crashed,
I figured...

13:38.917 --> 13:41.909
jungle's as good a
place as any to die.

13:41.917 --> 13:43.407
But you know something?

13:43.417 --> 13:44.953
I didn't die.

13:44.959 --> 13:46.950
I never felt better in my life.

13:46.959 --> 13:50.952
So, I figured it was time
to pay my old doc another visit.

13:50.959 --> 13:52.415
And what'd your doctor say?

13:52.417 --> 13:54.408
You won't believe this.

13:54.959 --> 13:59.953
That dark spot on my X ray...
the one that was killing me?

13:59.959 --> 14:01.415
Yeah?

14:01.417 --> 14:02.406
Gone.

14:02.417 --> 14:04.453
I've been given
a new lease on life.

14:04.458 --> 14:06.449
Man, I'm doing it right
this time.

14:06.458 --> 14:07.948
Straight.

14:07.959 --> 14:09.950
No more lies.

14:09.959 --> 14:12.951
Not even
about that CIA business?

14:14.959 --> 14:16.950
So, you'll go to them
and straighten it out?

14:16.959 --> 14:18.449
Not exactly.

14:18.458 --> 14:20.449
See, not everybody at the CIA
knows I'm working for 'em.

14:20.458 --> 14:21.948
well, you told me they asked you

14:21.959 --> 14:23.449
to keep on making
those deliveries.

14:23.458 --> 14:24.447
I was asked.

14:24.458 --> 14:25.994
But only by these two agents.

14:26.001 --> 14:27.457
My contact and his partner.

14:27.458 --> 14:28.994
See, somebody went bad
in the CIA,

14:29.001 --> 14:30.457
and until they found out
who it is,

14:30.458 --> 14:31.994
they couldn't trust anybody.

14:32.001 --> 14:33.457
who's your contact?

14:33.458 --> 14:34.994
"Light." That's his code name.

14:35.001 --> 14:35.990
Then we'll go to Light.

14:36.001 --> 14:36.990
How do we find him?

14:37.001 --> 14:37.990
Only one place I ever met him.

15:01.001 --> 15:03.492
This was the only place
we ever met.

15:03.500 --> 15:04.489
He didn't like crowds.

15:05.000 --> 15:06.991
Looks like
he got one now.

15:08.500 --> 15:09.489
we couldn't find
a weapon

15:10.000 --> 15:11.991
but we found some tracks
down the hill.

15:12.000 --> 15:13.991
All right, you boys
can take him away now.

15:14.500 --> 15:14.989
Thanks.

15:16.500 --> 15:18.491
You need some paperwork
you need to file on this?

15:19.000 --> 15:20.490
Yeah, fill out
this and, uh,

15:21.000 --> 15:21.989
and give it back
to me, okay?

15:22.000 --> 15:22.989
when you're done?

15:23.000 --> 15:24.536
Good deal.

15:32.000 --> 15:33.991
Uh-oh. Light's out.

15:34.000 --> 15:35.536
what?

15:35.542 --> 15:36.998
That's Light...

15:37.000 --> 15:38.991
my contact.

15:39.542 --> 15:41.533
who'd want him dead?

15:44.000 --> 15:45.536
Those are the guys!

15:45.542 --> 15:47.032
They killed him!

15:47.041 --> 15:48.531
Run away.

15:48.542 --> 15:49.531
Let's go!

16:00.041 --> 16:01.531
Halt or I'll shoot!

16:02.041 --> 16:04.578
Get in the car!

16:04.583 --> 16:07.040
All right,
come on, here we go!

16:22.041 --> 16:24.032
Their names are Dalton
and MacGyver.

16:24.041 --> 16:25.577
I want an APB now!

16:50.083 --> 16:51.619
Tell Mr. Berrenger

16:51.625 --> 16:53.616
that everything
is well in hand now.

17:13.625 --> 17:15.115
All right,
that's two of them.

17:15.125 --> 17:17.616
Let's go;
maybe Pete can help us.

17:17.625 --> 17:19.115
Not so fast.

17:19.125 --> 17:20.615
The guys we're dealing with
are good.

17:20.625 --> 17:22.115
They got the license number
from your Jeep

17:22.125 --> 17:23.114
at the funeral home.

17:23.125 --> 17:24.114
They know where you live.

17:24.125 --> 17:25.114
They know where you work.

17:25.666 --> 17:26.656
They'll be keeping an eye
on both.

17:27.125 --> 17:29.116
They can't keep an eye
on a phone call, can they?

17:31.667 --> 17:33.123
Let's go.

17:48.667 --> 17:50.157
That's crazy!

17:50.166 --> 17:51.656
we're both wanted for murder.

17:51.667 --> 17:53.157
The CIA think we killed Light,

17:53.166 --> 17:54.656
the police think
we killed Light.

17:55.166 --> 17:56.155
Police? CIA?

17:56.166 --> 17:57.656
How about the FBI?

17:57.667 --> 17:59.157
Let's go for the hat trick.

17:59.667 --> 18:01.157
witnesses?! who?!

18:01.166 --> 18:03.157
Getting so you can buy anything
for the right price.

18:03.166 --> 18:04.155
Thank you very much.

18:04.166 --> 18:05.702
we certainly will.

18:05.709 --> 18:06.698
Right.

18:06.709 --> 18:08.165
Papa Thornton come through?

18:08.166 --> 18:09.155
Can he bring us in?

18:09.709 --> 18:10.698
No, Pete's out of the country.

18:10.709 --> 18:12.165
Brockman's covering for him.

18:12.166 --> 18:14.703
He set up a meet
for tonight at 10:00.

18:14.709 --> 18:15.698
Friend of his at the CIA

18:16.166 --> 18:18.157
says it's the best way
to handle things.

18:18.166 --> 18:19.702
what do we do?
Meet.

18:44.750 --> 18:46.741
It's good to see you boys.

18:46.750 --> 18:48.206
I thought we'd hav
e a little more trouble

18:48.750 --> 18:49.739
bringing you in.

18:49.750 --> 18:51.741
That's the guy
from this afternoon.

18:51.750 --> 18:53.206
You said we killed Light.

18:53.208 --> 18:54.197
You work for the CIA.

18:54.208 --> 18:56.745
why don't you just climb
down off that thing?

18:59.208 --> 19:01.745
Move around there,
both of you.

19:01.750 --> 19:02.739
Nice and easy.

19:02.750 --> 19:03.739
Get 'em up.

19:04.208 --> 19:05.744
Keep your hands
in front there

19:05.750 --> 19:06.739
where I can see 'em.

19:07.250 --> 19:08.239
You, get 'em up.

19:08.250 --> 19:10.241
Am I dreaming,
or is this a movie?

19:10.250 --> 19:11.740
You like movies?

19:11.750 --> 19:13.240
How aboutThe Man
who Knew Too Much?

19:13.250 --> 19:16.242
I was thinking more of
Three Days of the Condor.

19:16.250 --> 19:19.242
what? Remind me.

19:19.250 --> 19:21.741
That's the one where
there's a bad apple in the CIA.

19:21.750 --> 19:23.240
He tries to kill
Robert Redford

19:23.250 --> 19:24.786
'cause he knows too much.

19:24.792 --> 19:25.781
Oh, that's right.

19:25.792 --> 19:27.783
Yeah, uh, with,
uh, Faye Dunaway?

19:27.792 --> 19:28.781
Yeah, and Max
von... you know.

19:28.792 --> 19:29.781
Right, right, right, right.

19:29.792 --> 19:31.248
All right, let me
get this straight, guys.

19:31.792 --> 19:32.781
I want to understand this.

19:32.792 --> 19:34.248
You're the bad apples,
obviously,

19:34.792 --> 19:36.783
and you're covering up the fact
that you're double agents,

19:36.792 --> 19:38.783
double-crossing the CIA.

19:38.792 --> 19:39.781
I don't think

19:39.792 --> 19:41.248
Faye Dunaway
could follow this.

19:41.250 --> 19:43.241
Sure she could.

19:43.250 --> 19:45.787
Now, we're Robert Redford,
and you're about to kill us?

19:45.792 --> 19:47.783
That is a good review.

19:47.792 --> 19:49.783
And the show's over.

19:50.291 --> 19:51.280
Oh-ho-ho!

19:51.291 --> 19:52.280
Look out!

19:56.792 --> 19:58.282
Mount up, Jack!

19:58.291 --> 19:59.781
Come on, MacGyver, push!

19:59.792 --> 20:02.784
I am pushing! Go!

20:16.834 --> 20:18.825
So, what am I supposed
to tell Berrenger?

20:18.834 --> 20:21.280
You tell him there's
been a change in plans.

20:21.291 --> 20:24.829
I'll make the final delivery
tomorrow... personally.

20:25.333 --> 20:26.823
what about them?

20:26.834 --> 20:27.823
The way I see it,

20:28.333 --> 20:29.823
there's only one
place they can go...

20:29.834 --> 20:33.326
the drop spot
that was scheduled for tonight.

20:33.333 --> 20:35.824
Let's go.

20:36.333 --> 20:37.322
what do we do now?

20:37.333 --> 20:39.324
The police want us for murder

20:39.834 --> 20:41.324
and the CIA wants us dead.

20:41.834 --> 20:45.873
Does anybody else know about
this arrangement with Light?

20:45.875 --> 20:46.864
"The Shadow knows! "

20:47.333 --> 20:48.869
Enough jokes, Jack!

20:48.875 --> 20:50.331
No joke.

20:50.333 --> 20:51.322
Shadow was Light's partner.

20:51.333 --> 20:52.869
Shadow and Light?!

20:52.875 --> 20:54.331
Makes sense, don't it?

20:54.875 --> 20:55.864
Can we trust him?
Her.

20:55.875 --> 20:57.331
I don't know.

20:57.875 --> 21:00.867
Light said she was on our side,
whichever side that is.

21:00.875 --> 21:02.866
So, where do we find
this Shadow?

21:02.875 --> 21:04.331
I thought you'd never ask.

21:10.875 --> 21:13.867
On wednesdays, I pick up t
he goods and take them to Light,

21:13.875 --> 21:15.866
and he'd switch 'em for
worthless information.

21:16.375 --> 21:18.366
That's what I'd brin
g back here to drop off.

21:18.375 --> 21:20.866
So, no real secrets
ever fell into the wrong hands?

21:20.875 --> 21:22.866
Guaranteed. But they
don't know that.

21:22.875 --> 21:24.365
So, who met you here
for the drop?

21:24.375 --> 21:26.366
Remember those nice gentle
men you met at my funeral?

21:26.375 --> 21:27.911
Ah.

21:28.375 --> 21:29.364
Jack, what makes you so sure

21:29.375 --> 21:31.366
they're gonna go through
with tonight's drop?

21:31.917 --> 21:32.906
They gotta.

21:32.917 --> 21:34.373
Light told me
it was the last one,

21:34.375 --> 21:36.366
the end of the line,
the piece de resistance.

21:36.917 --> 21:38.373
They'll just use
a different messenger.

21:38.375 --> 21:41.367
So, this could be the last
chance to see who's involved.

21:41.917 --> 21:43.908
That's why I figure
Shadow'll be here.

21:43.917 --> 21:45.908
with Light dead,
she's gonna want

21:45.917 --> 21:47.407
to keep an eye
on the drop.

21:47.417 --> 21:48.907
You gonna recognize her?

21:49.417 --> 21:50.406
I hope so.

21:50.417 --> 21:52.908
I only met her once...
in a library.

21:52.917 --> 21:54.407
what'd she look like?

21:54.417 --> 21:56.908
A librarian.

22:20.959 --> 22:22.950
There's a table.

22:34.959 --> 22:36.950
So?

22:36.959 --> 22:39.450
So she's not here.

22:39.458 --> 22:41.449
I gathered that.

22:41.458 --> 22:43.449
This is no place
for a librarian.

22:59.001 --> 23:01.447
well, looky there!

23:06.500 --> 23:09.492
Messenger.

23:12.500 --> 23:13.489
Hey, listen...

23:13.500 --> 23:14.990
since Shadow didn't show,

23:15.001 --> 23:16.491
maybe there's something
we can do.

23:17.001 --> 23:17.490
Like?

23:17.500 --> 23:19.991
Like intercept the package.

23:20.001 --> 23:22.993
You said tonight's
the biggie, right?

23:23.001 --> 23:25.993
They might think twice
about killing us if we had it.

23:26.000 --> 23:27.991
Ooh, leverage.
I love it.

23:28.000 --> 23:29.490
Let me do the talking.

23:29.500 --> 23:31.991
I've got this spy talk down
to a science.

23:36.000 --> 23:37.991
Do you have
my package here?

23:38.000 --> 23:39.490
Yes, I have
your package here.

23:45.542 --> 23:46.998
That's it?

23:47.000 --> 23:49.537
That'sspy talk?

23:49.542 --> 23:51.999
Some science.

24:16.542 --> 24:18.032
whoa, please!

24:18.041 --> 24:19.531
Not in front of the children.

24:21.041 --> 24:23.532
You don't look anything
like a librarian.

24:23.542 --> 24:25.032
Shadow?

24:25.041 --> 24:27.032
Shh. what do you amateurs
think you're doing?

24:27.041 --> 24:28.577
we got the package!

24:28.583 --> 24:29.572
Now we need your help.

24:29.583 --> 24:30.572
You're our last hope.

24:30.583 --> 24:32.039
what do you want me
to do, call the CIA?

24:32.583 --> 24:34.039
They already
killed my partner.

24:34.041 --> 24:35.030
That's right.

24:35.041 --> 24:37.578
And now it's your turn.

24:50.083 --> 24:52.119
All right, come on,
get up. Let's go!

24:52.125 --> 24:53.615
You set us up.

24:54.125 --> 24:56.616
Tonight's delivery was
the bait to bring us out.

24:57.125 --> 24:58.615
That's right. Now, let's go.

24:58.625 --> 25:00.616
No, I think we're a lot safer

25:00.625 --> 25:02.616
sitting right where we are.

25:02.625 --> 25:04.616
Makes no difference to us.

25:04.625 --> 25:06.115
we can kill you here

25:06.125 --> 25:08.616
or someplace a little
more quiet.

25:10.625 --> 25:13.116
what'll it be?

25:15.125 --> 25:17.116
Don't suppose
you got a plan?

25:17.125 --> 25:18.661
No, I figured
it was your turn.

25:28.667 --> 25:31.659
Honey, cut it out. Take a walk!

25:31.667 --> 25:33.157
Hey, that's no way

25:33.166 --> 25:35.157
to treat the lady.
Get lost!

25:35.667 --> 25:37.658
I think you ought
to tell her you're sorry.

25:37.667 --> 25:38.656
Get out
of here!

25:38.667 --> 25:41.158
Let's go.

25:41.667 --> 25:42.656
Come on.

25:42.667 --> 25:45.158
In here.

25:45.166 --> 25:46.656
There's a door
to the alley there.

25:46.667 --> 25:48.157
Lock that door.

25:49.667 --> 25:51.703
You think you've got enough
locks on here?

25:51.709 --> 25:53.165
we'll never get
out of this place!

25:53.166 --> 25:55.703
It's a bad neighborhood.

25:55.709 --> 25:56.698
This one needs a key.

25:56.709 --> 25:57.164
I've got one on the desk.

25:58.709 --> 26:01.155
Here. Here's a key.

26:05.166 --> 26:06.155
The wrong key?!

26:06.166 --> 26:07.702
whose dressing room
is this wrong key?

26:08.166 --> 26:10.157
Just try another lock
and I'll get another key.

26:18.709 --> 26:19.698
That's it. That's the key.

26:19.709 --> 26:21.199
Great.
Now you're cooking.

26:21.208 --> 26:23.199
Okay, Mac, come on.
we got it.

26:23.208 --> 26:25.199
Hang on a second.

26:25.208 --> 26:25.708
Go!

26:27.208 --> 26:27.708
Give me those!

26:28.709 --> 26:30.700
we got to beat it
before the cops get here.

26:30.709 --> 26:31.744
what about them?

26:31.750 --> 26:33.206
They're the ones
that are wanted.

26:33.208 --> 26:33.742
Jack!

26:34.750 --> 26:36.741
They can prove we're innocent!

26:56.250 --> 26:57.740
Hey, hey!

27:03.750 --> 27:06.742
Terrific.

27:06.750 --> 27:07.739
The cops are coming,

27:07.750 --> 27:09.741
and the real package
is out there somewhere,

27:09.750 --> 27:10.739
and I haven't got a clue.

27:11.250 --> 27:12.786
I got a shoe.

27:12.792 --> 27:13.781
what's that?

27:13.792 --> 27:15.248
I don't think
it's your size,

27:15.250 --> 27:16.239
Cinderella.

27:16.250 --> 27:16.784
what is it?

27:17.250 --> 27:18.239
Berrenger Import/ Export.

27:18.792 --> 27:19.247
Exposition Boulevard.

27:19.792 --> 27:21.248
Los Angeles, California.

27:21.792 --> 27:24.249
They still have to make
the real delivery.

27:24.250 --> 27:25.786
Maybe that's home base.

27:25.792 --> 27:27.248
If his shoe spends time there,

27:27.250 --> 27:28.239
maybe he does, too.

27:28.250 --> 27:30.241
Maybe you guysare
worth having around.

27:30.792 --> 27:31.781
Let's go.

27:31.792 --> 27:33.282
Yeah, before
the cops start asking

27:33.291 --> 27:34.781
too many questions.

27:48.792 --> 27:51.283
well...

27:51.291 --> 27:52.827
I guess it's up and over.

27:52.834 --> 27:55.826
Jack...

27:55.834 --> 27:57.290
how about down and under?

27:57.834 --> 27:58.289
Better.

27:58.834 --> 28:00.290
You're a pretty smart guy.

28:09.834 --> 28:11.825
After you, my good man.

28:42.875 --> 28:44.331
Here comes another one.

28:52.875 --> 28:57.369
well, it looks like Berrenger's heavy
into the import/ export business.

28:57.375 --> 28:58.865
what better co
ver than that?

28:59.375 --> 29:01.366
Everything moves in
and out of the country,

29:01.375 --> 29:02.364
all on the up and up.

29:10.375 --> 29:11.364
That's Michaels.

29:11.375 --> 29:12.911
who's Michaels?
who's Michaels?

29:12.917 --> 29:14.908
Jay Michaels,
the company leak.

29:20.917 --> 29:22.373
That's the guy
that tried to kill us.

29:22.375 --> 29:24.912
Jack, everybody's
tried to kill us.

29:24.917 --> 29:27.909
You mean you knew who
the bad guy inside the CIA was,

29:27.917 --> 29:29.373
and you didn't do anything?

29:29.375 --> 29:31.366
Treason is a pretty big
accusation to throw around.

29:31.375 --> 29:32.410
I need proof.

29:34.917 --> 29:36.407
And that might
be the proof I need.

29:43.917 --> 29:45.407
Final delivery.

29:48.417 --> 29:50.408
I.D., sir.

29:50.417 --> 29:51.953
Okay.

29:55.417 --> 29:56.953
Oh, I would give
anything

29:56.959 --> 29:58.415
to get inside
that warehouse.

30:02.959 --> 30:04.950
A cipher machine.

30:10.417 --> 30:13.955
Someone who's capable

30:13.959 --> 30:15.449
of intercepting encrypted
messages from the U.S.

30:15.959 --> 30:19.952
will now be able to
decrypt them as well.

30:19.959 --> 30:21.950
And they wouldn't have to wait

30:21.959 --> 30:23.449
to be handed secrets
from you or me.

30:23.959 --> 30:24.948
Precisely.

30:24.959 --> 30:26.950
which is why we have
to get all our money

30:26.959 --> 30:27.948
out of this thing up front.

30:27.959 --> 30:30.450
How does it work?

30:33.458 --> 30:34.447
Secret message...

30:39.001 --> 30:40.457
provide the predetermined
entry code...

30:49.001 --> 30:51.993
...and it's computed.

30:52.001 --> 30:55.493
And you've got your message.

30:55.500 --> 30:58.492
Fantastic.

31:10.001 --> 31:11.992
So much for
the loading dock door.

31:12.000 --> 31:12.989
You can only get through there

31:13.000 --> 31:14.490
if you're wearing
an invoice number.

31:14.500 --> 31:19.995
well, I guess that's
what I'm gonna have to do then.

31:24.500 --> 31:26.491
I'm impressed.

31:26.500 --> 31:27.990
It's everything you promised
and then some.

31:28.500 --> 31:30.491
And you say there'll
be no problem

31:30.500 --> 31:32.536
getting it out
of the country?

31:32.542 --> 31:36.535
I've prepared something
very special for its transport.

31:36.542 --> 31:37.998
Let me show you.

32:12.041 --> 32:14.578
Lacks the pizzazz
of the Trojan horse,

32:15.041 --> 32:16.030
but what the hey,
it seems to be working.

32:16.041 --> 32:17.030
So far.

32:34.083 --> 32:36.574
Just put it right here.

32:36.583 --> 32:37.572
Uh, lock up,
will you please?

32:37.583 --> 32:40.074
And both of you go
to warehouse number seven

32:40.083 --> 32:42.574
and start unloading
the new shipment.

32:43.083 --> 32:44.573
I have some business
to attend to here

32:45.083 --> 32:47.574
and I don't want to be disturbed
for the rest of the afternoon.

32:47.583 --> 32:48.572
Yes, sir.

33:02.083 --> 33:04.074
Now then...

33:08.083 --> 33:10.074
would you help me
with this bronze, please?

33:13.125 --> 33:15.616
Very heavy...

33:15.625 --> 33:17.115
Thank you.

33:20.125 --> 33:21.114
And now...

33:21.125 --> 33:24.117
this is where we'll conceal
the cipher machine.

33:24.125 --> 33:27.617
Oh-ho... that's very clever.

33:30.625 --> 33:34.664
So the buyer not only
gets a cipher machine,

33:34.667 --> 33:37.124
but a Remington bronze
in the bargain.

33:37.125 --> 33:38.114
At no extra charge.

33:39.667 --> 33:41.123
And with a certifica
te of ownership

33:41.125 --> 33:42.661
they'll have no trouble

33:42.667 --> 33:45.124
getting this Remingt
on through customs.

33:45.667 --> 33:47.123
Or the cipher.

33:47.667 --> 33:50.659
well, now all that's
left is for some buyer

33:50.667 --> 33:52.658
to make me
a very wealthy man.

34:06.166 --> 34:07.656
The plot thickens.

34:07.667 --> 34:08.656
Uh-huh.

34:11.667 --> 34:13.703
Don't suppose it'ssome
nickel-and-dime poker game

34:14.166 --> 34:14.699
in the back room, do you?

34:15.166 --> 34:16.155
No.

34:16.166 --> 34:18.157
whatever stakes
they're playing for,

34:18.166 --> 34:20.157
you can bet they're
a lot higher than that.

34:24.166 --> 34:26.157
Right on time.

34:26.708 --> 34:28.165
Before we show you
what you came to buy,

34:28.166 --> 34:29.702
will you please step
into my office,

34:29.708 --> 34:32.199
so we can discuss
a reasonable price.

34:35.708 --> 34:37.199
Please be seated.

34:48.208 --> 34:49.197
Ow!

35:29.750 --> 35:30.739
Psst!

35:33.250 --> 35:34.239
This way.

35:39.250 --> 35:39.784
Come on.

35:41.792 --> 35:42.781
Hey, I'll stay here

35:42.792 --> 35:44.783
and make sure no more
party crashers show up.

35:44.792 --> 35:45.781
Okay.

35:52.291 --> 35:54.282
where are they?

35:54.291 --> 35:55.781
ce
They're in
Berrenger's offi

35:55.792 --> 35:58.784
talking to some buyer
about a cipher machine.

35:58.792 --> 36:00.282
A cipher machine?!

36:00.291 --> 36:01.280
Are you sure?

36:01.291 --> 36:02.280
Yeah...

36:02.291 --> 36:03.781
take a look.

36:32.834 --> 36:33.823
wow.

36:47.333 --> 36:49.324
we have to get
this out of here.

36:49.834 --> 36:51.324
Its loss could
seriously compromise

36:51.333 --> 36:52.869
most of this country's
crypto-systems.

36:52.875 --> 36:54.866
It could destroy our
communications security.

36:55.333 --> 36:56.869
That big, huh?

36:56.875 --> 36:59.867
It could be a disaster if it fel
I into the wrong hands.

36:59.875 --> 37:02.332
Then prepare yourselves
for a disaster.

37:04.333 --> 37:06.870
I wouldn't do that
if I were you.

37:06.875 --> 37:08.331
Look behind you.

37:08.333 --> 37:10.324
That's the oldest trick
in the book.

37:11.333 --> 37:12.368
Good trick.

37:15.375 --> 37:16.865
Hold it right there!

37:16.875 --> 37:18.365
I've got a gun!

37:20.375 --> 37:23.367
So do I.

37:23.375 --> 37:26.867
Drop it, Dalton.

37:26.875 --> 37:29.366
Fingers...

37:31.375 --> 37:33.366
If you please...

37:36.917 --> 37:40.364
well, now that this excitement
is over,

37:40.375 --> 37:43.367
will you take care of
our uninvited guests.

37:45.375 --> 37:46.911
Don't you guys get it?

37:46.917 --> 37:47.906
"Dispose of them."

37:47.917 --> 37:49.908
It's a figure of speech.

37:49.917 --> 37:52.408
Inside.

37:56.917 --> 37:59.408
You've got to be kidding.

37:59.417 --> 38:00.907
Care to hear
the punch line?

38:09.417 --> 38:10.907
watch your legs!

38:16.417 --> 38:17.953
Get away
from the scoop!

38:17.959 --> 38:19.950
Climb over the lip! Quick!

38:19.959 --> 38:20.948
watch yourself.

38:20.959 --> 38:21.948
Jack, get
out of the way!

38:21.959 --> 38:23.415
Oh, you're crazy out there!

39:06.001 --> 39:07.992
Maybe we don't have to wait
until we get to the dump

39:08.458 --> 39:09.994
to dump this garbage
we're hauling.

39:10.001 --> 39:11.457
How do you figure?

39:11.458 --> 39:13.494
The convenience
of push-button killing.

39:21.500 --> 39:22.990
Is it my imagination
or is this room gettin' smaller?

39:25.001 --> 39:27.993
Oh...

39:28.001 --> 39:29.491
Oh!

39:31.001 --> 39:31.990
what is that?

39:32.001 --> 39:33.992
ng?
why is it movi

39:34.000 --> 39:34.989
It's the sled.

39:35.000 --> 39:37.491
Pushes all the trash out of the
back of the truck at the dump.

39:37.500 --> 39:40.492
But isn't the back gate
usually open at the time?

39:40.500 --> 39:40.989
Yeah.

39:41.000 --> 39:42.991
well, what do we do now?

39:43.000 --> 39:44.490
we need braces.

39:44.500 --> 39:45.990
Find some more boards,
sturdy ones.

39:48.500 --> 39:49.990
That's perfect, perfect.

39:50.000 --> 39:50.989
Here.

40:03.000 --> 40:04.991
I think it's working.

40:05.542 --> 40:06.998
what if it doesn't hold?

40:07.000 --> 40:08.536
Then we go to Plan B.

40:08.542 --> 40:09.531
what's Plan B?

40:09.542 --> 40:10.998
Let's see how
Plan A goes first.

40:19.542 --> 40:21.032
Oh!

40:21.041 --> 40:22.531
I think it's time for Plan B.

40:25.542 --> 40:28.033
It's getting closer.

40:30.542 --> 40:32.578
what're you doing now?

40:32.583 --> 40:34.039
Plan B.

40:34.041 --> 40:36.032
Find a piece of metal.

40:39.041 --> 40:40.577
what is Plan B?

40:40.583 --> 40:42.039
we're going fishing.

40:42.583 --> 40:44.039
I hope they're biting.

40:44.041 --> 40:48.034
MacGyver, exactly what
are we fishing for?

40:48.041 --> 40:50.032
A way to turn off
the sled control.

40:58.083 --> 40:59.072
MacGyver, hurry!

41:04.583 --> 41:05.572
Got it!

41:05.583 --> 41:07.073
Attaboy!
wonderful!

41:07.083 --> 41:08.072
Great!

41:08.083 --> 41:09.573
wait a minute!
You hooked the wrong thing.

41:09.583 --> 41:13.622
The sled's still coming
and the back end is opening.

41:13.625 --> 41:16.082
Ohhh...
Ohhh...

41:16.625 --> 41:17.614
what now?

41:17.625 --> 41:18.614
I guess we jump.

41:18.625 --> 41:20.616
At 50 miles an hour?!

41:20.625 --> 41:21.614
Is this part of the plan?

41:22.083 --> 41:23.072
Not exactly.

41:23.083 --> 41:24.619
what's Plan C?

41:25.083 --> 41:26.619
Jump!

41:35.625 --> 41:36.614
wait a minute!

41:36.625 --> 41:38.616
Pull over! I think
we got some trouble.

42:06.125 --> 42:08.116
They must still be in here.

42:08.125 --> 42:11.117
Yeah, let's go close the scoop,
huh?

42:29.166 --> 42:30.656
well, looks like we made
a little mess here.

42:30.667 --> 42:33.158
I know just the place
for this mess.

42:33.166 --> 42:34.702
In the truck with the rest
of the garbage.

42:34.709 --> 42:35.698
Good idea.

42:35.709 --> 42:37.700
Let's get my mess first.

42:37.709 --> 42:38.698
You always go first.

42:38.709 --> 42:40.700
Congratulations.

42:40.709 --> 42:43.701
I'm sure your country will be
very pleased with your purchase.

42:43.709 --> 42:46.155
Not until it arrives safely.

42:46.709 --> 42:49.155
You do have
the appropriate customs papers?

42:49.166 --> 42:50.155
Oh, yes.

42:50.166 --> 42:52.157
Everything
is in perfect order.

42:52.709 --> 42:53.698
It just needs
your signature.

42:53.709 --> 42:56.701
would you be kind enough
to come to my office?

42:58.208 --> 42:59.698
Move it, Jack!

42:59.709 --> 43:01.199
we gotta get
that cipher machine back.

43:01.208 --> 43:02.698
Okay, but what're
you doing up there?

43:03.208 --> 43:04.197
Looking for a cop.

43:04.208 --> 43:05.698
Are you kidding?

43:05.709 --> 43:07.199
You can never find o
ne when you need one.

43:07.208 --> 43:09.699
we'll just attract a little
attention on the way.

43:10.208 --> 43:10.708
All right!

43:17.208 --> 43:17.742
That's a red light!

43:17.750 --> 43:19.741
Exactly!

43:23.208 --> 43:24.744
Yo!

43:44.750 --> 43:48.743
My men should be back here
any minute now...

43:48.750 --> 43:53.244
and they'll take you
wherever you wish to go.

44:19.291 --> 44:19.791
CIA!

44:27.792 --> 44:28.781
Gotcha!

44:28.792 --> 44:30.282
Cuff him!

44:34.291 --> 44:35.827
Come on!

44:44.834 --> 44:46.290
Book him, Dan-o.

44:46.291 --> 44:48.282
Spy One.

44:48.291 --> 44:49.827
This is it.

44:49.834 --> 44:50.823
we did it.

44:50.834 --> 44:53.325
Yeah, I'd say we cleaned up
pretty good.

44:53.333 --> 44:55.324
Yep.

44:55.333 --> 44:56.823
Kind of makes you glad to
be alive again,

44:57.333 --> 44:57.833
doesn't it?

45:09.834 --> 45:11.324
well, MacGyver, you
saved my hide again.

45:11.333 --> 45:12.322
Guess that makes us even.

45:12.333 --> 45:13.322
Even?

45:13.333 --> 45:15.324
Okay, so you owe me one yet.

45:15.333 --> 45:16.869
But hey, who's counting?

45:21.333 --> 45:26.327
You know, being dead
made me realize something.

45:26.333 --> 45:28.870
Jack, you were only
in the coffin for half an hour.

45:29.333 --> 45:31.324
Ah, it's not the quantity
of time so much as the quality.

45:31.875 --> 45:32.864
Anyway, like I was saying,

45:32.875 --> 45:33.864
it made me
realize something.

45:33.875 --> 45:35.866
Life's a terrible thing to waste.

45:35.875 --> 45:37.866
Especially when it's yours.

45:37.875 --> 45:40.366
So, from now on,
I put myself to good use.

45:40.375 --> 45:43.367
An honest day's pay
for an honest day's work.

45:43.375 --> 45:44.865
Glad to hear it.

45:50.375 --> 45:51.865
where are you going?

45:51.875 --> 45:54.366
This isn't the way
to my Jeep.

45:54.375 --> 45:55.911
I could've sworn
I told you.

45:55.917 --> 45:57.908
I just got one
quick job to do.

45:57.917 --> 46:00.909
An honest day's work
for an honest day's pay?

46:00.917 --> 46:01.906
You got it.

46:01.917 --> 46:03.373
Quick stop by the pier.

46:03.375 --> 46:06.367
Look for a man with a peg leg
and a parrot on his shoulder.

46:06.375 --> 46:07.364
He's supposed to have
something for me.

46:07.375 --> 46:08.911
Jack!

46:08.917 --> 46:09.906
It's a joke, MacGyver!

46:09.917 --> 46:10.906
It's a joke!

46:11.305 --> 46:17.237
