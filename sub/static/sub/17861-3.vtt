00:02.429 --> 00:03.629
James.

00:03.703 --> 00:04.981
James! No.

00:04.983 --> 00:07.141
No-one else
is to know about this.

00:07.143 --> 00:08.381
No-one.

00:08.383 --> 00:10.101
I'd only share what I know
for his wellbeing.

00:10.103 --> 00:13.381
Good. Then there will be no need
for you to break the confidence.

00:13.383 --> 00:15.903
I know a disappointed man
when I see one.

00:17.023 --> 00:18.823
We're going to have a baby, James.

00:19.343 --> 00:20.581
But this...

00:20.583 --> 00:22.941
This will make a difference.

00:22.943 --> 00:25.421
You seemed very taken with
the singer yesterday.

00:25.423 --> 00:29.703
To them, he's just a farmer,
and I'd be just a fool.

00:29.742 --> 00:31.100
Our rooms have locks.

00:31.102 --> 00:32.299
I want the key to mine.

00:32.302 --> 00:35.180
In my experience,
one doesn't guard a door

00:35.182 --> 00:37.302
unless there's
something in the room.

00:39.142 --> 00:43.300
You checked the references
of a woman called Sarah Adams.

00:43.302 --> 00:45.180
That is not her real name.

00:45.182 --> 00:47.060
I'll get to the bottom of it,
Elizabeth.

00:47.062 --> 00:48.980
Because it is high time we knew

00:48.982 --> 00:52.422
exactly who Miss Bridget Adams
really is.

01:05.302 --> 01:07.060
Sister?

01:07.062 --> 01:09.380
I don't want to hold you up,
certainly not on your first day,

01:09.382 --> 01:11.060
but about yesterday...

01:11.062 --> 01:12.340
Yes.

01:12.342 --> 01:15.180
None of my other young ladies have
ever asked for a key before,

01:15.182 --> 01:17.900
and certainly none of them have ever
used that tone that you did...

01:17.902 --> 01:19.660
You went through my things.

01:19.662 --> 01:22.222
Someone did.
Can't see Alma or Maude doing it.

01:23.222 --> 01:24.460
Things seemed a little untidy.

01:24.462 --> 01:27.260
I was simply trying to help
put things in order.

01:27.262 --> 01:30.700
All I'm saying is, I hope that
we can put this behind us.

01:30.702 --> 01:31.980
I'm sure we can.

01:31.982 --> 01:33.940
Good. Good. Because there's
absolutely no reason

01:33.942 --> 01:36.700
why you and I should have a problem
with each other, is there?

01:36.702 --> 01:38.502
Is there?

01:41.462 --> 01:42.700
Well, as I always say,

01:42.702 --> 01:45.942
those with nothing to hide
need no lock and key.

01:47.822 --> 01:49.540
Great-Grandmamma.

01:49.542 --> 01:52.220
It has quite a ring to it.

01:52.222 --> 01:53.660
It does, doesn't it?

01:53.662 --> 01:55.380
Certainly put you in a good mood.

01:55.382 --> 01:56.540
Well, many things have.

01:56.542 --> 01:58.660
We'll have to show the baby off to
Libby's family, of course.

01:58.662 --> 02:00.700
Not too soon, I hope.

02:00.702 --> 02:03.260
I wouldn't advise travelling
with a wee one.

02:03.262 --> 02:05.060
I did it with your father.

02:05.062 --> 02:06.060
Very trying.

02:06.062 --> 02:07.740
Just a short trip.

02:07.742 --> 02:09.300
We might even fly.

02:09.301 --> 02:10.539
We could all go!

02:10.542 --> 02:12.340
60 hours in a tin can?

02:12.342 --> 02:13.940
I can think of nothing
less tantalising.

02:13.942 --> 02:16.060
It's the way of the future, Mother.

02:16.062 --> 02:17.860
Yours, perhaps.

02:17.862 --> 02:20.900
Better still, why don't we invite
your parents here, Olivia?

02:20.902 --> 02:22.580
They'll have to make
the crossing some time.

02:22.582 --> 02:24.060
That's a grand idea.

02:24.062 --> 02:25.820
Don't you think, James?

02:25.822 --> 02:26.940
William, too.

02:26.942 --> 02:28.820
He'd love to come.

02:28.822 --> 02:31.460
Late next year.
We'll make it a real bush Christmas,

02:31.462 --> 02:33.743
and by then the baby will be old
enough to be interesting.

02:34.662 --> 02:36.580
Look at you, Granddad.

02:36.582 --> 02:37.662
You're beaming.

02:38.822 --> 02:40.180
I am, aren't I?

02:40.182 --> 02:43.020
Yes, well,
guest lists are a little premature.

02:43.022 --> 02:45.022
We'll see, closer to the time.

contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:08.262 --> 03:09.502
Yes?

03:10.622 --> 03:11.820
Reporting for duty.

03:11.822 --> 03:14.580
Sister. Ah. Right.

03:14.582 --> 03:15.940
Yeah.

03:15.942 --> 03:17.180
Uh...

03:17.182 --> 03:18.582
Have a seat.

03:20.022 --> 03:21.020
Yeah.

03:21.022 --> 03:22.300
Nice and early.

03:22.302 --> 03:24.060
Can't wait to get started.

03:24.062 --> 03:26.142
A few things to sort out,
and you're away.

03:27.342 --> 03:29.180
Uh, something's come up.

03:29.182 --> 03:31.220
I doubt it's a problem.
It just needs clarifying.

03:31.222 --> 03:32.942
Yes?
Your name.

03:33.902 --> 03:35.620
It's Bridget Adams, yeah?

03:35.622 --> 03:36.662
Not Sarah.

03:38.062 --> 03:40.223
Any reason why you're not going
under your proper name?

03:41.582 --> 03:43.660
Simple question.

03:43.662 --> 03:45.180
So is the answer.

03:45.182 --> 03:46.740
Then let's have it.

03:46.742 --> 03:47.782
Get you to work.

03:50.462 --> 03:52.340
In my shoes, you'd be asking too.

03:52.342 --> 03:55.700
No, I'd be apologising
that your privacy had been invaded.

03:55.702 --> 03:57.900
I can imagine how you
got this information.

03:57.902 --> 04:00.020
Let's just get it sorted.
How did you find out, Doctor?

04:00.022 --> 04:01.180
Why are you being so defensive?

04:01.182 --> 04:02.980
If I have nothing to hide?
Yeah.

04:02.982 --> 04:06.060
Possibly it has something to do with
someone going into my room

04:06.062 --> 04:07.660
and going through my
personal effects

04:07.662 --> 04:09.540
and rushing off to spread mischief,

04:09.542 --> 04:11.580
and my employer somehow seeing me
as the villain of the piece.

04:11.582 --> 04:14.702
I don't condone...
I simply value my privacy.

04:16.262 --> 04:17.661
You have to give me more than that.

04:22.342 --> 04:26.500
Sarah is the name I have lived
and worked under for years.

04:26.502 --> 04:28.822
And further than that,
I'm asking for your trust.

04:30.142 --> 04:31.622
If not your support.

04:35.462 --> 04:38.542
You're using a name other than
the one on your passport.

04:41.502 --> 04:43.582
For goodness' sake, woman,
just tell me why!

04:45.262 --> 04:47.580
No.
Come on. Sit down.

04:47.582 --> 04:50.060
You chose the wrong woman
to interrogate, Doctor.

04:50.062 --> 04:52.102
Stop being so bloody dramatic!

04:55.582 --> 04:57.100
Back so early?

04:57.102 --> 04:58.382
Did you forget something?

05:00.542 --> 05:02.900
If you'll just let me explain,
Miss Adams.

05:02.902 --> 05:06.140
God as my witness,
I never meant you any harm!

05:06.142 --> 05:08.182
But you did me harm.

05:09.982 --> 05:11.540
I shouldn't have looked.

05:11.542 --> 05:12.540
I know.

05:12.542 --> 05:15.220
But you have so many secrets,
and you were under my roof.

05:15.222 --> 05:17.140
Curiosity I forgive.

05:17.142 --> 05:19.500
But telling Jack Duncan
what you found was spiteful.

05:19.502 --> 05:21.580
Dr Duncan? I'd never do that.

05:21.582 --> 05:23.940
So it was a coincidence
he found out?

05:23.942 --> 05:25.860
Well, no, but... It...

05:25.862 --> 05:26.902
Sarah.

05:28.182 --> 05:29.262
Bridget!

05:30.862 --> 05:33.780
I would never cost you your job.

05:33.782 --> 05:35.582
I know what it is to need a living.

05:36.582 --> 05:38.102
But I didn't tell Dr Duncan.

05:40.142 --> 05:41.662
Don't make me say who.

05:45.262 --> 05:46.540
I see.

05:46.542 --> 05:48.822
Won't you come back inside?

06:09.942 --> 06:13.220
You ask a perfectly reasonable
question of the woman,

06:13.222 --> 06:15.300
and she runs from it.

06:15.302 --> 06:17.260
Something of a validation,
wouldn't you say?

06:17.262 --> 06:19.140
No.

06:19.142 --> 06:21.340
In fact,
I think she made a fair point.

06:21.342 --> 06:22.822
As she fled the room.

06:24.062 --> 06:28.540
I think she's standing on a matter
of principle, not hiding any guilt.

06:28.542 --> 06:31.220
Either way, Jack, she's unsuitable.

06:31.222 --> 06:35.740
If she is prepared to flounce off
in high dudgeon on principle,

06:35.742 --> 06:38.340
she clearly doesn't want the job.

06:38.342 --> 06:40.220
We're well rid of her.

06:40.222 --> 06:41.942
How did you find out her real name?

06:42.942 --> 06:44.100
That's irrelevant.

06:44.102 --> 06:46.780
I'm asking
if you went through her things.

06:46.782 --> 06:48.020
Don't be ridiculous.

06:48.022 --> 06:49.700
I'm assuming Doris did it for you.

06:49.702 --> 06:52.660
She seems to have given up the post.

06:52.662 --> 06:54.102
Accept her decision.

06:55.102 --> 06:57.300
I plan to apologise.

06:57.302 --> 06:59.700
Convince her to stay... if I can.

06:59.702 --> 07:01.740
That would be a mistake.

07:01.742 --> 07:03.460
Well, I'm willing
to take a risk on it.

07:03.462 --> 07:04.740
I'm not.

07:04.742 --> 07:07.180
I don't accept your "on principle"
theory.

07:07.182 --> 07:10.540
Hers are the actions of someone
with something significant to hide.

07:10.542 --> 07:12.780
A desire for privacy isn't a crime.

07:12.782 --> 07:15.660
No, but it possibly hides one.

07:15.662 --> 07:16.742
Who knows?

07:22.422 --> 07:24.260
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to eavesdrop.

07:24.262 --> 07:25.940
I just wanted to let you know
that I'm taking Olivia

07:25.942 --> 07:27.660
on a tour of the property,
Grandmother.

07:27.662 --> 07:28.662
Very good.

07:29.902 --> 07:31.300
Jack.

07:31.302 --> 07:32.460
Be sensible.

07:32.462 --> 07:34.622
That's just what I intend to be.

07:36.582 --> 07:37.582
Oh!

07:46.182 --> 07:48.460
It's so lovely.

07:48.462 --> 07:49.660
I wish you'd brought me earlier.

07:49.662 --> 07:50.900
How?

07:50.902 --> 07:53.820
You wouldn't leave the house.

07:53.822 --> 07:56.782
I suppose I was
rather in the doldrums, wasn't I?

07:58.262 --> 07:59.500
It's odd.

07:59.502 --> 08:03.220
Ever since the baby,
I feel so different.

08:03.222 --> 08:07.020
Like I went to bed that girl,
and woke up...

08:07.022 --> 08:09.100
me, I suppose.

08:09.102 --> 08:11.540
Do I sound like a mad person?

08:11.542 --> 08:12.900
No.

08:12.902 --> 08:14.382
You sound happy.

08:17.382 --> 08:18.542
Come on.

08:22.422 --> 08:23.620
In winter?

08:23.622 --> 08:25.500
The sun's shining, isn't it?

08:25.502 --> 08:28.300
But I didn't bring my costume.

08:28.302 --> 08:30.302
Neither did I.

08:31.542 --> 08:33.220
Anna,
we can't just run around naked.

08:33.222 --> 08:34.580
What if someone comes?

08:34.582 --> 08:36.740
Well, then, we'd better hope
they've got bad eyes.

08:36.741 --> 08:38.659
Come on!

08:38.662 --> 08:40.580
Where's that new girl
you talked about?

08:40.582 --> 08:42.100
No-one's here.

08:42.102 --> 08:43.940
You're fine.

08:43.942 --> 08:45.022
I'm also British.

08:47.102 --> 08:48.742
Turn around.

08:55.742 --> 08:57.700
I can't believe I'm doing this.

08:57.702 --> 08:59.182
Hurry up!

09:01.942 --> 09:04.300
Alright.

09:04.302 --> 09:05.582
Come on, Livy.

09:08.862 --> 09:09.902
Ready?

09:13.822 --> 09:15.740
It is freezing in there!

09:15.742 --> 09:17.342
There she is.

09:28.942 --> 09:31.220
I'll need to leave my luggage here.

09:31.222 --> 09:32.900
How long until the Sydney train?

09:32.902 --> 09:34.020
Three o'clock.

09:34.022 --> 09:36.660
Fine.
And I'll need to borrow a bicycle.

09:36.662 --> 09:38.540
Bike?

09:38.542 --> 09:40.340
Couldn't say where you'd find one
around here.

09:40.342 --> 09:41.700
I saw one out the front.

09:41.702 --> 09:43.742
Yeah. That's mine.

09:55.062 --> 09:57.180
If you're looking for that woman,
you're too late.

09:57.182 --> 09:58.540
She's gone.

09:58.542 --> 10:00.780
Gone where?
I wouldn't know.

10:00.782 --> 10:02.300
Good riddance to bad news,
if you ask me.

10:02.302 --> 10:03.580
Now, if you'll excuse me,

10:03.582 --> 10:06.382
I'd rather not discuss
this in front of prying eyes.

10:15.102 --> 10:16.820
Livy, can I ask you something?

10:16.822 --> 10:18.060
Mmm?

10:18.062 --> 10:20.180
Did you always want babies?

10:20.182 --> 10:21.980
Of course.

10:21.982 --> 10:24.742
I just worried no-one would want to
have them with me.

10:27.582 --> 10:30.022
James was the first boy
I ever kissed, you know.

10:31.142 --> 10:34.140
Though I did like Kenneth McKinnon
for a while.

10:34.142 --> 10:35.660
Nothing could have happened,
of course.

10:35.662 --> 10:37.820
Why? Was he with someone?

10:37.822 --> 10:38.862
No.

10:39.942 --> 10:41.422
He was the gardener.

10:45.102 --> 10:48.262
That, and he wouldn't have looked
twice at me even if I was a shrub.

10:49.702 --> 10:51.780
What do you think would have
happened if...

10:51.782 --> 10:54.100
you'd shown interest in him?

10:54.102 --> 10:55.860
Heaven knows.

10:55.862 --> 10:58.340
But it wouldn't have been good.

10:58.342 --> 10:59.822
My cousin married beneath her.

11:00.902 --> 11:03.780
They stopped talking to her
altogether.

11:03.782 --> 11:06.220
Mmm. Our black sheep's
Aunt Caroline.

11:06.222 --> 11:08.780
I've never been told her sin.

11:08.782 --> 11:10.862
I think it's changing, though,
all of that.

11:12.102 --> 11:13.662
I hope so.

11:15.142 --> 11:18.702
There. Anne of Green Gables
would be jealous.

11:20.262 --> 11:22.780
Mummy would be horrified!

11:22.782 --> 11:24.022
Livy...

11:26.022 --> 11:28.020
are we friends now?

11:28.022 --> 11:29.262
Even better.

11:30.782 --> 11:31.822
We're sisters.

11:33.342 --> 11:34.460
Good.

11:34.462 --> 11:36.180
There's somewhere else
I want to take you.

11:36.182 --> 11:37.342
Come on.

11:40.782 --> 11:41.780
Here we are.

11:41.782 --> 11:43.220
How the other half live.

11:43.222 --> 11:44.580
Don't be a snob.

11:44.582 --> 11:46.460
The Polettis are family friends.

11:46.462 --> 11:47.500
I'm sorry.

11:47.502 --> 11:48.902
I'm teasing.

11:51.462 --> 11:53.020
You've met him already.

11:53.022 --> 11:55.780
Gino and his father
performed at the concert.

11:55.782 --> 11:58.060
Oh, the dreamy Italian.

11:58.062 --> 11:59.460
Of course I remember.

11:59.462 --> 12:01.540
Don't give me that look.

12:01.542 --> 12:05.740
It's just more fun
than sandwiches with Gran.

12:05.742 --> 12:07.020
Mm-hm.

12:07.022 --> 12:10.940
Besides, it's time you
made some more friends here.

12:10.942 --> 12:12.742
The whole family is lovely.

12:14.062 --> 12:16.340
They went through hell
during the war.

12:16.342 --> 12:20.580
Mr Poletti was interned
as an enemy alien.

12:20.582 --> 12:22.182
Did they do that here?

12:23.822 --> 12:26.860
Their eldest son went back
to fight for Mussolini.

12:26.862 --> 12:27.940
Broke their hearts.

12:27.942 --> 12:30.340
Don't talk about it.

12:30.342 --> 12:31.980
Anna!

12:31.982 --> 12:34.060
Oh, Anna!

12:34.062 --> 12:36.222
Girls!
Anna.

12:57.302 --> 12:59.220
Sarah.

12:59.222 --> 13:00.382
What a nice surprise.

13:01.902 --> 13:04.102
I'm afraid this isn't
a social visit.

13:05.862 --> 13:07.582
There are things you need to know.

13:13.520 --> 13:14.718
We'll be private in here.

13:14.720 --> 13:16.438
Thank you.

13:16.440 --> 13:18.480
There's no easy way to say this.

13:21.640 --> 13:24.840
James attempted suicide on the ship
the night before we docked.

13:26.200 --> 13:27.560
No.
Yes.

13:32.400 --> 13:33.638
Why?

13:33.640 --> 13:35.558
I have no idea.

13:35.560 --> 13:36.678
It was me who stopped him.

13:36.680 --> 13:38.118
And you only tell me now?

13:38.120 --> 13:39.358
James swore me to silence.

13:39.360 --> 13:40.958
He preferred your mother handled
the situ...

13:40.960 --> 13:42.438
My mother knows?

13:42.440 --> 13:43.958
Just her and I.

13:43.960 --> 13:47.198
Which, I believe, is why she's made such
a point of keeping me out of your lives.

13:47.200 --> 13:49.638
Something she's finally
succeeded in doing.

13:49.640 --> 13:50.920
I'm leaving.

13:51.760 --> 13:52.958
Leave... Why?

13:52.960 --> 13:55.558
Ask your mother.
That's not why I'm here.

13:55.560 --> 13:57.518
I'm here for James.

13:57.520 --> 14:00.838
I kept silent because she said
she had his best interest at heart.

14:00.840 --> 14:02.080
I no longer believe that.

14:03.280 --> 14:04.440
He says he's fine.

14:05.680 --> 14:07.478
But watch him.

14:07.480 --> 14:08.640
I'm not convinced.

14:14.560 --> 14:16.478
You have no idea why he did it?

14:16.480 --> 14:18.120
If I knew, I would tell you.

14:23.840 --> 14:25.640
I won't forget your kindness,
George.

14:26.680 --> 14:27.678
Can't I...

14:27.680 --> 14:30.358
I need a place to rest.

14:30.360 --> 14:31.640
Not more battles.

14:42.720 --> 14:44.840
What comes next
you brought on yourself.

14:47.640 --> 14:48.640
Mother?

14:55.520 --> 14:57.358
All over!
Gino!

14:57.360 --> 14:59.280
Today?
Si!

15:00.560 --> 15:02.798
Smells wonderful.
May I ask what it is?

15:02.800 --> 15:05.478
Ribollita. It's from Tuscany.
It's very popular.

15:05.480 --> 15:06.878
What do you put in it?

15:06.880 --> 15:08.038
Oh! Everything.

15:08.040 --> 15:10.480
What she find in the kitchen
she put.

15:11.480 --> 15:13.158
Almost.

15:13.160 --> 15:17.998
I haven't been to the north
of Italy, only Napoli and Roma.

15:18.000 --> 15:19.318
E molto bella.

15:19.320 --> 15:20.518
Hey.

15:20.520 --> 15:22.198
Oh, aren't you full of surprises.

15:22.200 --> 15:23.840
I think the wine's gone to my head.

15:24.920 --> 15:27.278
You just can't find table wine here.

15:27.280 --> 15:28.758
Why is that?

15:28.760 --> 15:30.518
Every meal back home we had wine.

15:30.520 --> 15:32.920
Even for breakfast at Christmas.

15:33.960 --> 15:35.518
Australians no like.

15:35.520 --> 15:39.678
No, they like the port, sherry,
birra, uffa!

15:39.680 --> 15:41.318
So, we make port.

15:41.320 --> 15:42.518
We make sherry.

15:42.520 --> 15:43.678
We make money from them.

15:43.680 --> 15:46.438
The wine we make for us.

15:46.440 --> 15:48.278
You take a bottle.
Si.

15:48.280 --> 15:50.558
Oh, I'd love that. Thank you.

15:50.560 --> 15:52.198
How do you like it here?

15:52.200 --> 15:53.680
Everyone's been friendly.

15:55.120 --> 15:58.078
I suppose it's normal to miss home,
though, isn't it?

15:58.080 --> 15:59.878
Hmm, no.

15:59.880 --> 16:01.158
For you, maybe.

16:01.160 --> 16:03.638
Now, we've been here over 20 years.

16:03.640 --> 16:04.998
Si.
Huh?

16:05.000 --> 16:06.880
Must have been hard
with the war and everything.

16:11.160 --> 16:12.878
Gilda, play a song?

16:12.880 --> 16:14.078
Gino's favourite?
Hey!

16:14.080 --> 16:16.158
Hey, Gino, it's just music.

16:16.160 --> 16:17.238
We need music.

16:17.240 --> 16:18.678
Si.

16:18.680 --> 16:20.238
He sings it all day.

16:20.240 --> 16:21.358
In the vines.

16:21.360 --> 16:22.558
In bed.

16:22.560 --> 16:24.718
Always singing.

16:24.720 --> 16:26.598
Oh, I know this.

16:26.600 --> 16:28.838
It's from that film.
What's it called?

16:28.840 --> 16:29.838
What have I said?

16:29.840 --> 16:32.238
'Anna'. It's called 'Anna'.

16:32.240 --> 16:34.640
Oh, stop being silly!

16:36.040 --> 16:37.518
Come on!

16:37.520 --> 16:38.518
Si.

16:38.520 --> 16:39.560
Whoo-hoo!

16:40.600 --> 16:42.120
Come on, Gino!

16:49.560 --> 16:51.600
Gino's lovely.

16:54.080 --> 16:55.798
I suppose so.

16:55.800 --> 16:59.238
Oh, we've been friends for years.

16:59.240 --> 17:01.520
He's... he's more like a brother.

17:09.640 --> 17:11.640
This is so lovely.

17:28.440 --> 17:30.478
Mother?

17:30.480 --> 17:31.998
I've been calling.

17:32.000 --> 17:33.120
You didn't answer.

17:34.120 --> 17:36.360
Because I don't appreciate
being bellowed at.

17:37.480 --> 17:38.840
Is what Sarah Adams said true?

17:40.000 --> 17:42.198
I don't know
if anything she says is true.

17:42.200 --> 17:43.320
Did...

17:44.440 --> 17:46.000
James try to kill himself?

17:50.760 --> 17:51.800
Why?

17:52.480 --> 17:54.280
That's something you'll need
to ask him.

17:55.400 --> 17:59.040
But before you pillory me,
I kept his secret for the family.

18:00.240 --> 18:01.838
For you, most of all.

18:01.840 --> 18:03.480
Tell me, please, how this helps me.

18:04.560 --> 18:06.118
He's my son.

18:06.120 --> 18:08.598
And your son made a mistake.

18:08.600 --> 18:11.358
One he didn't want to
inflict on you.

18:11.360 --> 18:14.398
That woman made a promise to James
and to me.

18:14.400 --> 18:16.598
She should not have broken it.

18:16.600 --> 18:17.918
She saved his life.

18:17.920 --> 18:19.558
And now she threatens to ruin it.

18:19.560 --> 18:22.840
She saved his life and you repay
her by running her out of town.

18:24.880 --> 18:26.241
You should be ashamed of yourself.

18:29.080 --> 18:31.040
James has rallied.

18:32.560 --> 18:35.398
If you bring it up with him,
you be very careful.

18:35.400 --> 18:36.958
I will do what I think is right,

18:36.960 --> 18:39.200
both with James
and with Sarah Adams.

19:02.360 --> 19:03.398
Shoo!

19:03.400 --> 19:05.158
You can't come.

19:05.160 --> 19:06.240
Shoo!

19:10.960 --> 19:12.520
I said shoo!

19:13.720 --> 19:15.600
Go back to the house!

19:17.120 --> 19:18.878
Go!

19:18.880 --> 19:19.920
Go!

19:35.680 --> 19:38.558
I can chuck a u-ey and give you
a lift back to town if you'd like.

19:38.560 --> 19:40.158
No thanks, Roy.

19:40.160 --> 19:41.318
Look after that leg.

19:41.320 --> 19:43.160
I thought that was your job now.

20:02.320 --> 20:04.920
Come on, boy.

20:10.080 --> 20:11.558
You settle him down.
I'll get the vet.

20:11.560 --> 20:12.718
Really? We should come with you.

20:12.720 --> 20:15.798
No. The last thing he needs is to be
bouncing around on this rattle trap.

20:15.800 --> 20:18.760
I'll be back
in two shakes of a lamb's tail.

20:23.560 --> 20:24.600
You're alright.

20:28.040 --> 20:29.040
You're alright.

20:30.320 --> 20:31.520
Shh.

20:41.200 --> 20:43.400
You're alright.

21:00.523 --> 21:01.923
This is a nice surprise.

21:01.969 --> 21:05.569
Good to see you can still hold
an axe, not just a croquet mallet.

21:07.976 --> 21:09.694
You smell of wine.
What have you been up to?

21:09.696 --> 21:11.334
I took her to the Polettis.

21:11.336 --> 21:13.454
They were having lunch,
so we joined in.

21:13.456 --> 21:14.814
It was wonderful.

21:14.816 --> 21:16.574
And we went to the water hole too.

21:16.576 --> 21:18.254
It's beautiful there.

21:18.256 --> 21:20.054
Would you mind
if I kept you company?

21:20.056 --> 21:21.534
Not at all.

21:21.536 --> 21:22.976
I'll see you at home, then.

21:28.656 --> 21:30.374
What are you doing?
I'm helping.

21:30.376 --> 21:31.616
Is that wise in your condition?

21:32.416 --> 21:35.174
I'm expecting, not infirm.

21:35.176 --> 21:39.256
Besides, I'm a landowner's wife now.

21:40.256 --> 21:41.336
Time to get used to it.

21:44.616 --> 21:45.774
Have you seen your brother?

21:45.776 --> 21:47.654
He's mending the fence
near the west dam.

21:47.656 --> 21:49.054
Did he say how long he'll be?

21:49.056 --> 21:51.414
No. What's happened?

21:51.416 --> 21:53.254
Just something
I need to discuss with him.

21:53.256 --> 21:55.534
Well, I can get him.
No, no. It's alright.

21:55.536 --> 21:57.334
But there is something
you can do for me.

21:57.336 --> 22:00.134
You and Sarah have become close.
Yes.

22:00.136 --> 22:01.854
Then go to the train station.

22:01.856 --> 22:04.654
She's planning to leave and perhaps
you can do something I couldn't.

22:04.656 --> 22:06.014
Convince her to stay.

22:06.016 --> 22:09.054
Why would she leave?
I'll explain later. Just go.

22:09.056 --> 22:11.134
If she gets on that train,
I can't see her coming back.

22:11.136 --> 22:12.494
I'll bring her here?
No, no, no.

22:12.496 --> 22:14.536
Put her up at the hotel for now
and tell her that...

22:17.016 --> 22:18.776
Just hurry.

22:24.376 --> 22:26.614
She left her stuff and dashed off.
That's all I can tell you.

22:26.616 --> 22:28.494
How long until the train?
20 minutes.

22:28.496 --> 22:29.776
I'll sit with the bags, then.

22:30.936 --> 22:32.416
You've got company.

22:34.016 --> 22:35.776
She'd better bring my bike back.

22:40.736 --> 22:41.856
Just me.

22:42.896 --> 22:44.094
Any idea where she is?

22:44.096 --> 22:45.854
I don't even know
why she's leaving.

22:45.856 --> 22:47.854
Father wouldn't say. Do you?

22:47.856 --> 22:49.974
If he didn't, I probably shouldn't.

22:49.976 --> 22:51.134
Oh.

22:51.136 --> 22:54.494
Old enough to do everyone's bidding,
but not to know why.

22:54.496 --> 22:56.214
You sound like
you're reading too much Bronte.

22:56.216 --> 22:57.814
Well, the whole thing
is just so 'Jane Eyre'.

22:57.816 --> 23:00.574
The distraught damsel
rushing off without warning.

23:00.576 --> 23:02.576
Who's Rochester? You or father?

23:03.856 --> 23:05.974
This is melodramatic enough
without you adding to it.

23:05.976 --> 23:07.496
I just want to know the story.

23:08.576 --> 23:12.014
Weren't you arguing about it
with Gran this morning?

23:12.016 --> 23:13.976
Look, I don't pretend to know
the half of it.

23:15.176 --> 23:16.416
Let's just change her mind.

23:17.376 --> 23:19.334
Oh, and questions about her past?

23:19.336 --> 23:21.136
Not the way to do it.

23:22.216 --> 23:23.814
You know...
Anna.

23:23.816 --> 23:26.014
Why is it Gran lets you
get away with murder?

23:26.016 --> 23:27.814
What do you mean?

23:27.816 --> 23:31.494
If James or I or even father
spoke to her like you do,

23:31.496 --> 23:32.734
we'd be out on our ear.

23:32.736 --> 23:34.054
Ah.

23:34.056 --> 23:35.216
That's the question.

23:36.736 --> 23:38.656
Well, I'd like to know the answer
as much as you.

23:39.696 --> 23:41.056
Let me know if you ever find out.

23:50.456 --> 23:52.414
If he makes the morning,
he should pull through,

23:52.416 --> 23:54.854
but if I were you,
I'd think about putting him down.

23:54.856 --> 23:55.974
He's no pup.

23:55.976 --> 23:57.614
I was thinking the same thing
meself.

23:57.616 --> 23:59.894
I gave up on one animal yesterday.
I'm not giving up on this one.

23:59.896 --> 24:01.534
So he's yours?

24:01.536 --> 24:03.574
Well, he's nobody's.

24:03.576 --> 24:04.814
But we won't put him down.

24:04.816 --> 24:06.014
I'll pay for the care.

24:06.016 --> 24:08.334
Okey-doke. I'll send you the bill.
You know where I am.

24:08.336 --> 24:09.576
Thanks, Barry.

24:10.856 --> 24:12.534
Looks like you got yourself a dog.

24:12.536 --> 24:13.936
It was my fault.

24:15.856 --> 24:17.774
I want to stay with him.

24:17.776 --> 24:19.296
If that's OK by you.

24:21.336 --> 24:22.856
You suit yourself, missy.

24:28.136 --> 24:29.294
Look at you.

24:29.296 --> 24:30.496
Farmer's wife.

24:32.936 --> 24:34.174
James.

24:34.176 --> 24:35.814
A word.

24:35.816 --> 24:38.496
No need to wait, my dear.
We'll be in.

24:43.016 --> 24:45.654
Miss Adams was here.
She's told your father everything.

24:45.656 --> 24:48.614
What do you mean everything?
Only what she knows.

24:48.616 --> 24:50.254
He's looking for answers.

24:50.256 --> 24:52.254
You have to find a story
he can believe.

24:52.256 --> 24:53.654
Stick to it.

24:53.656 --> 24:55.494
Reassure him that you're alright.

24:55.496 --> 24:57.214
I am.
Good.

24:57.216 --> 24:58.496
What will you say?

25:01.456 --> 25:03.416
The best lie
is a version of the truth.

25:08.296 --> 25:09.694
Oh.

25:09.696 --> 25:10.854
Is James with you?

25:10.856 --> 25:13.054
There you are.
Come to the sitting room.

25:13.056 --> 25:14.696
What's happening?
Nothing.

25:17.296 --> 25:18.696
Just a business matter.

25:41.936 --> 25:43.056
So...

25:44.376 --> 25:45.494
it is true?

25:45.496 --> 25:47.016
You tried to kill yourself?

25:48.856 --> 25:49.856
Yes.

25:51.256 --> 25:52.416
You said nothing.

25:54.296 --> 25:55.894
I was ashamed.

25:55.896 --> 25:57.496
To despair so deeply that...

25:59.896 --> 26:01.056
You're my son.

26:02.656 --> 26:03.894
And you're my father.

26:03.896 --> 26:06.416
You could have talked to me.
I felt I couldn't.

26:13.216 --> 26:14.296
Why, James?

26:20.496 --> 26:22.374
I was in love.

26:22.376 --> 26:25.576
With... someone in London.

26:26.776 --> 26:28.216
She came from nothing.

26:29.736 --> 26:31.854
Leaving her...

26:31.856 --> 26:33.094
broke my heart.

26:33.096 --> 26:36.894
It... broke something in me.

26:36.896 --> 26:38.296
If it was so serious...

26:39.336 --> 26:40.696
why rush into marrying Olivia?

26:42.576 --> 26:44.694
Grandmother found out.

26:44.696 --> 26:46.936
Made it very clear
that I had to move on.

26:48.616 --> 26:50.214
So I did.

26:50.216 --> 26:52.496
I knew Livy through her brother.

26:53.776 --> 26:55.936
I knew marrying her
would make everyone happy.

26:58.096 --> 26:59.334
The truth is, it did.

26:59.336 --> 27:00.736
Except you.

27:03.616 --> 27:04.736
Perhaps.

27:05.616 --> 27:08.496
But like it or not, Gran was right.

27:09.976 --> 27:11.456
I can't just marry anyone.

27:12.576 --> 27:13.856
None of us can.

27:20.096 --> 27:21.416
Promise me one thing.

27:22.456 --> 27:23.654
I won't feel like that again.

27:23.656 --> 27:25.534
You can't promise me that.

27:25.536 --> 27:26.936
But if you do...

27:29.016 --> 27:32.496
if you ever hurt that deeply,
tell me.

27:33.496 --> 27:35.096
Let me help.

27:42.376 --> 27:43.536
I'm better now.

27:44.776 --> 27:45.936
I'm happy.

27:47.496 --> 27:48.616
I am.

27:57.816 --> 27:59.734
Maybe we should give it
a while longer.

27:59.736 --> 28:01.054
No, that was the last train

28:01.056 --> 28:03.854
and if she's not back now,
I'm guessing she doesn't mean to be.

28:03.856 --> 28:05.774
Unless something bad's happened.

28:05.776 --> 28:08.014
If she was that upset,
do you think...?

28:08.016 --> 28:10.214
She's not the type
to do anything rash.

28:10.216 --> 28:11.294
Rash?

28:11.296 --> 28:14.536
As in leave town and abandon
all she owns at the station?

28:17.696 --> 28:18.694
Do you need a lift home?

28:18.696 --> 28:22.374
No, I've got the car and I promised
father I'd wait until I saw her.

28:22.376 --> 28:24.094
You can't stay here all night.

28:24.096 --> 28:26.056
I'll call when I find her. Yeah?

28:27.856 --> 28:31.574
She's, um, lucky to have a boss
who cares about her.

28:31.576 --> 28:32.856
She's a good nurse.

28:47.576 --> 28:49.656
I told him a tale.
He accepted it. We're fine.

28:53.776 --> 28:54.896
For now.

29:15.656 --> 29:17.174
Tea's in the red tin
if you're looking.

29:17.176 --> 29:18.574
I'm not making tea.

29:18.576 --> 29:19.934
Your dressing needs tending to.

29:19.936 --> 29:21.734
It's fine.
It's filthy.

29:21.736 --> 29:24.134
Did you at least sterilise
those bandages?

29:24.136 --> 29:26.054
In the oven, like you told me.
Good.

29:26.056 --> 29:27.816
Then sit down
and roll your pants up.

29:34.936 --> 29:36.174
So, where's it gonna be, then?

29:36.176 --> 29:38.014
Sydney, I s'pose.

29:38.016 --> 29:39.536
I don't know
what you're talking about.

29:40.936 --> 29:43.056
I didn't take you as the type
to cut and run.

29:44.536 --> 29:46.454
I don't see it as running.
Don't you?

29:46.456 --> 29:49.054
No. I've been here a few days.
There's nothing keeping me here.

29:49.056 --> 29:51.014
If you believed that,
you wouldn't be here right now.

29:51.016 --> 29:52.776
Well, I couldn't just go
and let the dog die.

29:56.816 --> 29:58.936
You stayed because you cared.

30:00.416 --> 30:02.894
Doesn't much matter about what.

30:02.896 --> 30:04.176
That's all I'm saying.

30:06.536 --> 30:07.736
But what would I know, hey?

30:33.759 --> 30:35.199
The haricots beurre are lovely.

30:42.839 --> 30:44.599
Has Jack called about Sarah?

30:44.834 --> 30:47.192
His name is Dr Duncan.
He doesn't mind.

30:47.194 --> 30:48.874
Why? Has something happened to her?

30:50.874 --> 30:53.032
She's missing.
Has been all day.

30:53.034 --> 30:54.792
Just because someone
absents themselves

30:54.794 --> 30:55.912
does not mean they're missing.

30:55.914 --> 30:58.792
I'd call it missing. No-one's seen
her since she left here.

30:58.794 --> 31:02.594
The span of one afternoon
doesn't exactly merit a manhunt.

31:03.634 --> 31:05.232
Why are you being so callous?

31:05.234 --> 31:06.752
What did she ever do to you?

31:06.754 --> 31:08.232
That's enough.

31:08.234 --> 31:10.352
Can we at least eat dinner in peace?

31:10.354 --> 31:12.314
No, I don't...
Enough, Anna.

31:23.914 --> 31:25.632
What a difference a day makes.

31:25.634 --> 31:26.874
You're not helping.

32:04.674 --> 32:06.672
You're a hard woman to find.

32:06.674 --> 32:08.434
Sorry to have put you out.

32:09.834 --> 32:11.754
You said to take you at your word.

32:12.634 --> 32:13.834
I'm here to say I will.

32:16.194 --> 32:17.874
Change your mind?
It's not that.

32:21.194 --> 32:23.352
I might have made
staying impossible.

32:23.354 --> 32:26.594
I had some final dealings
with Elizabeth Bligh.

32:28.034 --> 32:31.472
Suffice to say, if she wasn't
an enemy before, she is now.

32:31.474 --> 32:32.674
She was before.

32:34.274 --> 32:37.112
But I want you at the hospital
and I'll fight to keep you there.

32:37.114 --> 32:39.192
Enough to make her your enemy too?

32:39.194 --> 32:41.712
If that's the cost of
doing the right thing.

32:41.714 --> 32:43.114
I didn't stand up for you earlier.

32:44.554 --> 32:45.594
I will now.

32:49.714 --> 32:51.792
What changed your mind?

32:51.794 --> 32:54.192
Something in the way
you said the word "interrogate".

32:54.194 --> 32:55.912
Saw myself through your eyes.

32:55.914 --> 32:57.434
It's a very dirty word to me.

33:01.634 --> 33:03.114
Think about it.

33:04.714 --> 33:06.154
No conditions.

33:06.994 --> 33:08.114
No questions.

33:20.114 --> 33:21.394
Coming to bed?

33:23.274 --> 33:24.434
In a minute.

33:28.194 --> 33:29.994
You can talk to me, you know.

33:31.714 --> 33:33.112
What do you mean?

33:33.114 --> 33:35.234
About whatever happened
between you and your father.

33:36.634 --> 33:39.194
I'm guessing it had something
to do with Sarah Adams.

33:40.554 --> 33:41.834
I'm not blind.

33:43.714 --> 33:45.674
I do see when you're upset.

33:47.714 --> 33:48.754
I always have.

33:49.914 --> 33:51.394
Especially on the ship.

33:53.434 --> 33:56.032
Perhaps one day,
you'll learn to talk to me.

33:56.034 --> 33:57.234
I'll see you upstairs.

33:59.194 --> 34:00.474
Sit with me?

34:17.353 --> 34:19.114
Before we got married...

34:20.634 --> 34:22.313
I was in love with someone.

34:23.754 --> 34:25.194
Someone totally wrong.

34:27.474 --> 34:29.514
It was over
by the time we got together.

34:32.914 --> 34:34.434
I didn't want it to be.

34:38.194 --> 34:39.992
Do you still love her?

34:39.994 --> 34:41.351
No.

34:41.353 --> 34:42.873
Do you?
No.

34:43.754 --> 34:45.752
Then why didn't you tell me?

34:45.754 --> 34:47.552
It was my pain.

34:47.554 --> 34:49.114
I didn't want it to be yours.

34:49.994 --> 34:51.434
But it was.

34:52.714 --> 34:54.514
I saw you suffer.

34:55.714 --> 34:57.912
I thought it was me.

34:57.914 --> 34:58.992
No.

34:58.994 --> 35:00.552
All this time, I...

35:00.554 --> 35:02.352
I thought it was me.

35:02.354 --> 35:03.992
No, Livy. No.

35:03.994 --> 35:06.912
I was so happy today.

35:06.914 --> 35:08.714
You're everything to me.

35:11.554 --> 35:14.234
You... and the baby.

35:17.194 --> 35:18.714
I won't shut you out again.

35:20.354 --> 35:21.634
I promise.

35:38.794 --> 35:40.632
He's gonna make it through.

35:40.634 --> 35:42.234
You know how I know?

35:43.274 --> 35:45.115
I told him you'd leave
if he kicked the bucket.

35:46.194 --> 35:47.432
Ought to have a name, but.

35:47.434 --> 35:48.912
He's Boy.

35:48.914 --> 35:50.992
I reckon he's lucky.

35:50.994 --> 35:52.114
Lucky.

35:53.074 --> 35:54.472
I like it.

35:54.474 --> 35:55.834
Oh, no. I meant that he...

35:56.914 --> 35:58.352
Hmm.

35:58.354 --> 36:00.354
Looks like you've got yourself
a new moniker, mate.

36:10.194 --> 36:11.634
I'll take mine outside.

36:38.354 --> 36:39.754
A bit of a chaser.

36:53.114 --> 36:54.754
You know,
you're dead out in the city.

37:07.794 --> 37:10.114
Albert got himself shot down
over France.

37:13.834 --> 37:15.674
Daniel never made it back
off Kokoda.

37:17.154 --> 37:19.514
Never got so much as a button
off their coats.

37:24.914 --> 37:26.632
Well...

37:26.634 --> 37:28.674
plenty suffered worse, I s'pose.

37:31.194 --> 37:32.755
There's a room for you here,
Miss Adams.

37:33.874 --> 37:35.354
Till you get yourself settled again.

37:38.594 --> 37:39.874
Call me Sarah, Roy.

37:42.274 --> 37:44.074
Righto. Sarah.

37:46.394 --> 37:47.874
Well, it's here if you want it.

37:57.834 --> 37:59.554
The name on my passport is Bridget.

38:00.874 --> 38:02.194
That's my birth name.

38:04.394 --> 38:06.232
That's what caused
all the trouble today.

38:06.234 --> 38:07.914
People wanting the truth behind it.

38:10.274 --> 38:11.514
Well, it's a nice name, that.

38:12.754 --> 38:14.434
Yeah, I changed it when I married.

38:16.914 --> 38:18.074
My husband was Jewish.

38:18.914 --> 38:20.754
When you convert,
you're given a Jewish name.

38:24.234 --> 38:26.834
But I lost all proof of
that identity during the war.

38:31.834 --> 38:32.994
Rene died.

38:35.434 --> 38:36.474
In Dachau.

38:39.954 --> 38:41.354
I...

38:43.874 --> 38:45.034
lived.

38:53.674 --> 38:54.834
It goes no further.

39:05.919 --> 39:07.599
Albert always loved this room.

39:07.624 --> 39:09.024
Gets the first sun, you know.

39:13.282 --> 39:14.682
You'd have liked my Albert.

39:23.692 --> 39:24.932
Come in.

39:30.932 --> 39:32.570
Alright.

39:32.572 --> 39:34.612
If you're game, so am I.

39:35.452 --> 39:37.252
Then I'll see you
first thing tomorrow.

39:41.092 --> 39:43.090
So, uh, what changed your mind?

39:43.092 --> 39:45.730
I didn't think
I was that persuasive.

39:45.732 --> 39:46.852
You aren't.

39:50.572 --> 39:52.292
So she explained herself?

39:53.812 --> 39:55.372
Hm. I didn't think so.

39:55.412 --> 39:57.650
I'm prepared to take her on trust.

39:57.652 --> 40:00.210
You will live with the consequences.

40:00.212 --> 40:01.572
That's it.

40:03.852 --> 40:06.290
I don't think this is funny.

40:06.292 --> 40:08.490
I'm just thinking of a question
Anna asked me yesterday.

40:08.492 --> 40:11.930
Well, when you've finished
amusing yourself, you can leave.

40:11.932 --> 40:13.452
Elizabeth...
Go!

40:14.572 --> 40:17.490
This is not ingratitude
and I don't want it come between us.

40:17.492 --> 40:19.690
But it's a risk
you're clearly prepared to take.

40:19.692 --> 40:21.372
Go on. Get out!

40:27.132 --> 40:29.612
Now, whatever your problem with her,
she's a good woman.

40:30.652 --> 40:31.812
A good nurse.

41:11.652 --> 41:12.850
Mind company?

41:12.852 --> 41:14.572
Oh, sorry.
I didn't mean to wake ya.

41:16.692 --> 41:17.932
It's the Ashes.

41:18.932 --> 41:21.850
The first time in 19 years
if the Poms take it.

41:21.852 --> 41:23.370
How are we doing?

41:23.372 --> 41:24.650
Depends whose side you're on.

41:24.652 --> 41:26.290
You sound like
a bit of a Pommy to me.

41:26.292 --> 41:27.852
Don't be daft.

41:38.292 --> 41:39.852
Lucky, eh?

41:40.852 --> 41:42.052
Lucky.

41:49.012 --> 41:52.650
Morris with
his face wreathed in smiles now.

41:52.652 --> 41:54.410
Sends up one to Compton, short.

41:54.412 --> 41:56.770
Outside the leg stump.
