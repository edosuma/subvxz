WEBVTT

05:04.679 --> 05:07.421
Jesus, we didn't
have to do that.

05:07.473 --> 05:09.464
He didn't have to do that.
They weren't a threat to us.

05:09.475 --> 05:11.011
He didn't have to do that.
They weren't a threat to us.

05:11.102 --> 05:13.809
What is wrong with him?

05:13.896 --> 05:16.603
I could go upstairs right now...

05:18.359 --> 05:20.315
What?

05:20.361 --> 05:23.068
What are you gonna do?

05:23.156 --> 05:25.363
I could throw his ass
in the goddamn ocean.

05:25.408 --> 05:27.023
I think we need him.

05:27.118 --> 05:29.404
We need his house.
We need Mexico.

05:29.454 --> 05:30.910
We can survive
without him.

05:30.997 --> 05:32.988
I want to do more
than survive.

05:33.082 --> 05:35.368
I need to start over.

05:35.418 --> 05:37.454
All the shit that's happened,

05:37.503 --> 05:39.835
all the shit we let happen...

05:42.550 --> 05:44.541
I put those kids in that raft.

05:44.552 --> 05:47.009
I put those kids in that raft.

05:47.096 --> 05:48.836
That was me.

05:48.931 --> 05:51.547
You didn't out the line.

05:53.102 --> 05:55.684
We can't trust Strand.

05:55.730 --> 05:58.187
We don't even know if this
place in Mexico even exists.

05:58.274 --> 06:00.936
Okay, but he hasn't lied.

06:02.195 --> 06:04.151
And we're gonna gamble

06:04.238 --> 06:06.320
our families' lives on that?

06:18.628 --> 06:21.586
Why don't you sleep?

06:21.631 --> 06:24.543
Yeah, there's too much
noise in my head.

06:27.303 --> 06:28.964
Yeah.

06:29.055 --> 06:30.591
You ever been?

06:32.016 --> 06:34.678
Mexico.

06:34.727 --> 06:36.718
No, my parents crossed through Tijuana
when they first left El Salvador.

06:36.729 --> 06:38.685
No, my parents crossed through Tijuana
when they first left El Salvador.

06:38.731 --> 06:40.392
You been back?

06:42.402 --> 06:44.984
We didn't really leave the
neighborhood once we got settled.

06:45.071 --> 06:47.062
They put everything
into that shop.

06:47.073 --> 06:48.438
They put everything
into that shop.

06:48.491 --> 06:50.482
And I put everything
into watching over them.

06:50.493 --> 06:51.733
And I put everything
into watching over them.

06:51.828 --> 06:54.069
I gave up a lot

06:54.163 --> 06:57.075
and they didn't need as much
watching over as I thought.

06:57.166 --> 06:59.248
What'd you do, you know, for yourself?

06:59.335 --> 07:01.291
What do you mean?

07:03.089 --> 07:05.296
Like...

07:05.383 --> 07:07.123
relationships.

07:08.803 --> 07:10.885
I had some.

07:12.807 --> 07:15.765
Yeah, I was seeing
this girl back in Pomona.

07:15.810 --> 07:18.017
- Yeah?
- Maria Santos.

07:19.063 --> 07:20.769
Long time?

07:20.857 --> 07:23.473
No. No.
A few months.

07:23.526 --> 07:25.517
Then my mom moved us back to LA.

07:25.528 --> 07:27.018
Then my mom moved us back to LA.

07:27.113 --> 07:29.195
New school.
Parochial.

07:29.282 --> 07:31.273
I went to Catholic K through 12.

07:31.284 --> 07:32.319
I went to Catholic K through 12.

07:32.410 --> 07:34.401
Definite/y had some fun my
parents didn't know about.

07:34.412 --> 07:35.618
Definite/y had some fun my
parents didn't know about.

07:35.663 --> 07:37.699
Made some bad decisions.

07:49.927 --> 07:51.303
Hey.

07:52.722 --> 07:54.258
You're gonna be able to make some.

07:54.348 --> 07:56.885
There are still girls on this planet.

07:56.976 --> 07:59.217
That's what I'm banking on?

07:59.312 --> 08:01.223
Yes.

08:01.314 --> 08:03.145
Other girls left on this planet?

08:03.232 --> 08:05.484
Yeah.

08:05.526 --> 08:07.391
Somewhere out there.

08:11.657 --> 08:12.863
What the hell?

08:16.871 --> 08:17.986
Shit.

08:18.080 --> 08:20.617
We need help!

08:20.666 --> 08:23.157
Should I shoot them?

08:23.252 --> 08:25.117
Help!
Please, help us!

08:25.213 --> 08:28.080
She's bleeding.

08:28.174 --> 08:30.165
- Please, help us.

08:30.259 --> 08:32.420
- Should I shoot?
- Oh, God.

08:32.512 --> 08:34.377
Dad?!

08:34.472 --> 08:36.588
Something's wrong. Something's
wrong with the baby.

08:37.808 --> 08:39.639
Dad!

08:39.685 --> 08:41.596
- Where are you guys?
- Please help.

08:41.646 --> 08:42.931
Please.

08:43.022 --> 08:45.013
- Dad!

08:45.024 --> 08:46.059
- Dad!

08:46.150 --> 08:48.141
Just breathe. Breathe.

08:48.152 --> 08:49.312
Just breathe. Breathe.

08:49.403 --> 08:51.530
- Madison!
- Dad, they just got on the boat.

08:51.572 --> 08:53.563
It wasn't my fault. I didn't let them in.
They just boarded.

08:53.574 --> 08:54.859
It wasn't my fault. I didn't let them in.
They just boarded.

08:54.951 --> 08:56.942
- Easy, easy. I got her. - Look, she's in bad
shape, man. She's in bad shape.

08:56.953 --> 08:58.159
- Easy, easy. I got her. - Look, she's in bad
shape, man. She's in bad shape.

08:58.246 --> 08:59.827
Just wait here.

08:59.872 --> 09:01.658
Here, let's go over here.

09:05.002 --> 09:07.539
- Where's your boat?
- We lost our engines.

09:07.588 --> 09:09.829
We've been drifting for days.

09:22.895 --> 09:24.476
Did you see anyone else on the water?

09:24.564 --> 09:26.054
Did you come from a larger group?

09:26.148 --> 09:27.934
Everything's been a blur.

09:28.025 --> 09:30.311
Frankly, uh, we've had a
very hard time. Vida...

09:38.411 --> 09:41.369
Stupid, paranoid fool.

09:43.958 --> 09:46.074
Please, we're--
we're good people.

09:51.007 --> 09:52.872
Okay, oh--

09:52.925 --> 09:54.586
Mom, what's going on?

09:54.635 --> 09:57.047
- The baby's in distress.
- Who's that?

09:57.138 --> 09:58.719
Just stay in your room, okay?

09:58.764 --> 10:00.220
We're almost there.

10:02.143 --> 10:04.008
What happened
before your engine cutout?

10:04.103 --> 10:06.936
We were holding out
on some other boat...

10:06.981 --> 10:09.472
We were scared, but we were sun/iving.

10:09.567 --> 10:11.558
Our hull got dinged when we were
leaving the marina in Long Beach.

10:11.569 --> 10:12.854
Our hull got dinged when we were
leaving the marina in Long Beach.

10:12.903 --> 10:14.814
We-- we panicked.

10:14.864 --> 10:16.980
We thought we patched it
up good, but we rushed it.

10:17.074 --> 10:19.065
Then we started taking on water
and the engine flooded.

10:19.076 --> 10:20.691
Then we started taking on water
and the engine flooded.

10:20.745 --> 10:22.576
Jack?

10:24.248 --> 10:25.488
What did you do?

10:25.583 --> 10:26.948
Madison.

10:42.433 --> 10:44.173
Jack?

10:44.268 --> 10:46.884
- Don't, please.
- He's doing his job.

10:46.937 --> 10:49.098
- Kip, tie her.
- Why are you doing this?

10:49.190 --> 10:51.146
You can circumnavigate
the world from this ship.

10:51.233 --> 10:53.690
- She's a prize.
- You're making a mistake.

10:53.736 --> 10:56.569
No, I think your son made the mistake.

10:56.656 --> 10:58.988
"Should I shoot them?"

10:59.075 --> 11:01.987
Piece of advice-- if you
have to ask the question,

11:02.036 --> 11:03.401
somebody should already be dead.

11:12.046 --> 11:13.911
Daniel's next.
Your girl can help you.

11:13.964 --> 11:15.955
I'm not doing shit.

11:18.636 --> 11:20.217
We can bind them, we can shoot them.

11:20.304 --> 11:22.920
No skin off my nose.

11:33.109 --> 11:34.565
Kip, check the rest of the boat.

11:34.652 --> 11:36.608
Look for the captain and Nick.

11:39.323 --> 11:40.859
How do they know our names?

11:40.908 --> 11:43.900
I don't know, Daniel.
I didn't--

11:43.953 --> 11:45.864
I didn't tell them about that.

11:57.299 --> 11:58.835
Jack.

11:59.927 --> 12:01.133
Get him.

12:01.220 --> 12:02.835
Jack, don 't.

12:04.348 --> 12:05.963
Jack.Jack.

12:14.150 --> 12:15.811
Did you get him?

12:15.860 --> 12:17.600
If I didn't, the hypothermia will.

12:29.415 --> 12:31.406
An estimated 60,000
residents have homes under water

12:31.417 --> 12:32.748
An estimated 60, 000
residents have homes under water

12:32.793 --> 12:34.533
and that number
is expected to rise.

12:34.628 --> 12:36.368
Refugees have fled
primarily to Baton Rouge...

12:36.464 --> 12:38.671
My father never understood
what I wanted to do.

12:38.758 --> 12:40.874
And what was that?

12:40.926 --> 12:43.668
Create.
Control. Own.

12:45.181 --> 12:47.172
What did your father do?

12:47.183 --> 12:48.218
What did your father do?

12:48.309 --> 12:50.300
He ended his life
as a strip mall preacher.

12:50.311 --> 12:51.346
He ended his life
as a strip mall preacher.

12:51.437 --> 12:54.429
He had a great voice.
Rich baritone.

12:54.523 --> 12:56.809
Resonant.

12:56.859 --> 12:59.350
Your mother?

12:59.445 --> 13:01.436
I'm sure she lived a
fruitful and fulfilling life

13:01.447 --> 13:02.482
I'm sure she lived a
fruitful and fulfilling life

13:02.573 --> 13:03.983
far from us.

13:04.033 --> 13:05.694
Yeah.

13:05.785 --> 13:08.447
My birth mother was absent as well.

13:10.289 --> 13:11.904
Only child?

13:13.334 --> 13:15.245
West Coast.

13:17.254 --> 13:19.245
No man as serious as you would wear
a tie that color east of Tucson.

13:19.256 --> 13:20.587
No man as serious as you would wear
a tie that color east of Tucson.

13:23.385 --> 13:25.376
This again.
Same for my friend.

13:25.387 --> 13:26.672
This again.
Same for my friend.

13:26.764 --> 13:29.426
I can't tell where you're from.

13:29.517 --> 13:32.384
- Not from here.

13:34.146 --> 13:35.932
Whoa.

13:35.981 --> 13:38.597
I've come here to buy.

13:40.027 --> 13:41.983
Now?

13:42.029 --> 13:44.441
When there's blood
in the streets, buy land.

13:44.532 --> 13:47.365
- It's an old adage.
- Yeah.

13:47.451 --> 13:49.692
Rothschild.

13:49.787 --> 13:52.574
After Napoleon lost at Waterloo.

13:52.665 --> 13:55.122
That's correct.

13:55.167 --> 13:56.623
I know.

13:58.504 --> 14:00.916
I bought before the storm.

14:00.965 --> 14:02.956
My leverage equity
is on Saint Claude Avenue.

14:02.967 --> 14:04.047
My leverage equity
is on Saint Claude Avenue.

14:04.093 --> 14:06.175
What remains.

14:06.262 --> 14:08.253
I went by the building yesterday.

14:08.264 --> 14:09.344
I went by the building yesterday.

14:09.431 --> 14:11.422
Everything I own is submerged
and beyond salvage.

14:11.433 --> 14:13.845
Everything I own is submerged
and beyond salvage.

14:13.894 --> 14:15.634
Lucky man.

14:15.729 --> 14:18.061
l'm bankrupt.

14:18.107 --> 14:20.519
l have to begin again.

14:20.609 --> 14:22.600
l have to close half the
Ninth Ward tomorrow.

14:22.611 --> 14:23.942
l have to close half the
Ninth Ward tomorrow.

14:23.988 --> 14:25.979
I got to look those people in the eye.

14:25.990 --> 14:27.025
I got to look those people in the eye.

14:27.074 --> 14:29.565
So don't.

14:29.660 --> 14:32.367
l'm obligated to the business.

14:32.454 --> 14:34.445
And to my father.

14:34.540 --> 14:36.781
Sounds like you
don't care for either.

14:36.876 --> 14:39.618
You don't have to care for that
to which you're obligated.

14:39.712 --> 14:41.794
It helps.

14:43.173 --> 14:45.209
I'm an opportunist.

14:48.596 --> 14:50.587
Maybe you're an optimist.

14:50.598 --> 14:52.338
Maybe you're an optimist.

14:53.893 --> 14:55.884
I'm a parasite, but thank you.

14:55.895 --> 14:57.806
I'm a parasite, but thank you.

15:07.615 --> 15:09.901
Easy. Easy.

15:09.950 --> 15:11.941
- Easy. Easy.

15:11.952 --> 15:13.158
- Easy. Easy.

15:16.206 --> 15:17.707
Your room.

16:13.681 --> 16:15.672
Maybe I won't remember.

16:15.683 --> 16:17.344
Maybe I won't remember.

16:24.441 --> 16:26.432
Shh.

16:45.796 --> 16:47.036
That a gunshot wound?

16:49.717 --> 16:51.799
Who has the key to the boat?

16:54.096 --> 16:55.711
I don't know.

16:55.806 --> 16:57.717
You gonna start lying now?

16:57.808 --> 16:59.639
You leave her alone.

17:01.228 --> 17:03.219
Hey, that guy you shot, genius,

17:03.230 --> 17:04.766
Hey, that guy you shot, genius,

17:04.857 --> 17:06.688
was the one with the key.

17:06.775 --> 17:08.481
You shot our captain.

17:11.572 --> 17:12.903
That true?

17:16.785 --> 17:19.071
- Hey, keep your goddamn hands--
- Get back.

17:20.998 --> 17:23.455
Don't-- don't--
don't hurt him.

17:23.542 --> 17:25.533
I'm going to give you to the count of five

17:25.544 --> 17:26.750
I'm going to give you to the count of five

17:26.837 --> 17:29.169
to tell me where the key to the boat is.

17:29.214 --> 17:30.750
- One.
- He doesn't have it.

17:30.841 --> 17:32.297
Who does?
Two.

17:32.342 --> 17:34.298
Please, just stop, okay?
Come on, man.

17:35.929 --> 17:37.510
- Three.

17:39.808 --> 17:41.469
Strand.

17:45.105 --> 17:47.096
Like she said, Strand, our
captain, he has the keys.

17:47.107 --> 17:48.267
Like she said, Strand, our
captain, he has the keys.

17:49.359 --> 17:50.394
Hey!

17:50.486 --> 17:52.147
- Dad! Dad!
- Four.

17:52.196 --> 17:54.278
You just--
you don't need the keys, okay?

17:55.949 --> 17:58.816
I can start the boat without the keys.

17:58.911 --> 18:00.947
I can wire the boat.

18:01.038 --> 18:03.370
Just let my son go.

18:14.843 --> 18:16.799
Everything under control?

18:16.887 --> 18:18.798
Mom.

18:18.889 --> 18:21.801
- Maddy?
- I'm okay, Travis.

18:26.146 --> 18:27.431
Where's Nick?

18:27.523 --> 18:29.354
He wasn't there
when I woke up.

18:29.399 --> 18:31.390
- I heard gunshots.
- Strand abandoned the ship.

18:31.401 --> 18:32.686
- I heard gunshots.
- Strand abandoned the ship.

18:32.778 --> 18:34.860
They shot at him.

18:34.947 --> 18:36.687
Was he hit?

18:36.782 --> 18:39.148
- We don't know.
- Was he alone?

18:39.201 --> 18:42.034
Strand yanked out the wheelhouse radio.
No one else is here.

18:42.121 --> 18:44.112
Well, Travis here just bet his son's life
that he can start the boat without a key.

18:44.123 --> 18:45.988
Well, Travis here just bet his son's life
that he can start the boat without a key.

18:46.083 --> 18:48.540
So... watch them.

18:48.627 --> 18:51.209
Find the spare radio.
Reach out to Connor.

18:51.255 --> 18:53.291
Oh, and take your princess with you.

18:53.340 --> 18:54.876
No, no, no.
She stays, she stays.

18:54.967 --> 18:57.208
Mom, don't.

18:57.261 --> 18:59.047
It's okay.
It's okay.

18:59.138 --> 19:01.675
I'm okay.

19:01.765 --> 19:03.756
I brought this on us.
I can make it better.

19:03.767 --> 19:04.802
I brought this on us.
I can make it better.

19:06.311 --> 19:08.393
Hmﬁmm.

19:11.150 --> 19:13.015
All right, come on, let's go.

19:17.865 --> 19:19.526
What are you doing?
Don't touch me.

19:19.616 --> 19:21.117
I can loosen these.

19:27.416 --> 19:29.577
I didn't come here to hurt anyone.

19:31.336 --> 19:33.327
You baited me.
You lied to me.

19:33.338 --> 19:35.294
You baited me.
You lied to me.

19:35.340 --> 19:37.331
- I had no choice.
- Why, someone put a gun to your head?

19:37.342 --> 19:38.377
- I had no choice.
- Why, someone put a gun to your head?

19:38.427 --> 19:40.918
Reed, that's his function.

19:41.013 --> 19:42.674
We all have a function.

19:42.764 --> 19:44.550
Right, and what about my mom?

19:44.641 --> 19:46.427
That bitch beat her.
What's her function?

19:46.476 --> 19:48.467
Connor will civilize things
when he gets here.

19:48.478 --> 19:50.059
Connor will civilize things
when he gets here.

19:50.147 --> 19:52.809
He keeps us together.
But he's not a violent man.

19:52.900 --> 19:55.016
- He allows violence.
- He likes me.

19:55.110 --> 19:57.852
He listens to me.

19:57.946 --> 19:59.811
l have to talk to Connor.

19:59.907 --> 20:02.649
You'll have to show me
where the portable is.

20:02.743 --> 20:05.234
What happens after you call?

20:05.287 --> 20:07.573
COHHOF assesses.

20:07.664 --> 20:09.495
And then I'm safe?

20:10.959 --> 20:12.119
I promise.

20:12.211 --> 20:14.418
And what about my family?

20:15.714 --> 20:17.750
Connor listens to me.

21:45.387 --> 21:47.969
- Later.

21:59.484 --> 22:01.475
Victor Strand.

22:01.486 --> 22:02.601
Victor Strand.

22:02.654 --> 22:04.645
Hope we're not interrupting.

22:06.533 --> 22:08.148
l'm Thomas Abigail.

22:08.243 --> 22:10.529
This is Luis Flores.

22:10.579 --> 22:12.615
May we come in?

22:19.212 --> 22:21.589
Wow.
Hmm.

22:25.093 --> 22:27.960
-So...

22:28.055 --> 22:30.046
you knew what to buy, you
just couldn't afford better.

22:30.057 --> 22:31.388
you knew what to buy, you
just couldn't afford better.

22:31.433 --> 22:33.424
I spent a percentage on wardrobe.

22:33.435 --> 22:34.675
I spent a percentage on wardrobe.

22:34.770 --> 22:36.761
Mostly you took out
cash advances on my cards.

22:36.772 --> 22:38.228
Mostly you took out
cash advances on my cards.

22:38.315 --> 22:40.306
- Totaling, Luis?
- $36,000 across the four.

22:40.317 --> 22:42.524
- Totaling, Luis?
- $36,000 across the four.

22:42.569 --> 22:43.934
Where did that money go?

22:48.033 --> 22:50.024
I purchased 30 grand in credit card debt.

22:50.118 --> 22:52.109
Debt collection seems beneath you.

22:52.204 --> 22:54.661
It's where
I started before.

22:54.706 --> 22:56.571
Then what?

22:56.625 --> 22:59.367
Fringe real estate.

22:59.419 --> 23:01.284
In five years,
I'll be back to where l was.

23:01.380 --> 23:03.371
But better dressed.

23:03.423 --> 23:05.755
- Yes.
- You don't want to wait that long, do you?

23:05.842 --> 23:07.833
-Don't condescend.
- You shouldn't have to wait that long.

23:07.844 --> 23:08.924
-Don't condescend.
- You shouldn't have to wait that long.

23:09.012 --> 23:11.094
You look like a man
who can create

23:11.181 --> 23:13.172
beauty from something coarse.

23:13.183 --> 23:14.639
beauty from something coarse.

23:14.684 --> 23:16.811
I'm a student of the fine.

23:16.895 --> 23:18.806
I like that.

23:25.445 --> 23:27.436
If you're not gonna call the
police, then I thank you.

23:27.447 --> 23:28.562
If you're not gonna call the
police, then I thank you.

23:28.615 --> 23:30.606
If you want a return on your
investment, l'll oblige.

23:30.617 --> 23:32.198
If you want a return on your
investment, l'll oblige.

23:32.285 --> 23:33.695
You'll pay me back.

23:33.745 --> 23:36.327
I intended to with interest.

23:36.415 --> 23:38.531
We can discuss the details.

23:38.583 --> 23:40.574
Tom, the man stole from you.

23:40.585 --> 23:42.041
Tom, the man stole from you.

23:44.923 --> 23:47.756
Meet me downstairs.

23:47.801 --> 23:50.087
I'll be the one at the bar.

23:53.849 --> 23:55.805
Thank you...

23:55.892 --> 23:57.052
for the pardon.

23:58.311 --> 24:00.438
I didn't pardon you.

24:00.480 --> 24:02.345
l obligated you.

24:43.231 --> 24:45.222
Look, if you're full of shit, why
don't you save us both some time?

24:45.233 --> 24:46.439
Look, if you're full of shit, why
don't you save us both some time?

24:47.652 --> 24:49.608
I got this.
| just...

25:07.631 --> 25:09.622
Look, this whole thing is--

25:09.633 --> 25:12.375
Look, this whole thing is--

25:12.469 --> 25:14.380
look, it's all computerized, okay?

25:17.974 --> 25:20.056
So I'm gonna have to override it

25:20.143 --> 25:22.008
from down in the engine room.

25:26.149 --> 25:28.140
Did you see Nick
when you were on watch?

25:28.151 --> 25:29.391
Did you see Nick
when you were on watch?

25:29.486 --> 25:31.693
He might have come up
when we were on the bow.

25:31.738 --> 25:34.480
And the only one who would
know is in the sea.

25:35.825 --> 25:38.407
There's only three of them.

25:38.495 --> 25:40.076
Can you get loose?

25:40.163 --> 25:42.370
Keep her distracted.

25:48.797 --> 25:50.128
Looking for your girl?

25:50.215 --> 25:51.546
Let's just fix the engine, huh?

25:51.591 --> 25:52.967
She's my sister.

25:53.051 --> 25:55.337
You're doing your sister?

25:55.428 --> 25:57.419
Ooh, that's pretty twisted, man.

25:57.430 --> 25:58.556
Ooh, that's pretty twisted, man.

25:58.598 --> 26:01.214
/ should have the boat
running in about an hour.

26:01.309 --> 26:03.300
You don't have an hour.
30 minutes, tops.

26:03.395 --> 26:05.852
Chris, ignore him.

26:05.897 --> 26:07.433
Good luck with that.

26:09.401 --> 26:11.062
When are you due?

26:13.238 --> 26:15.320
Don't know.
Lost track.

26:16.741 --> 26:18.697
Well, if you were counting before all this,

26:18.743 --> 26:19.949
you're still counting.

26:20.036 --> 26:22.288
Four weeks.

26:22.372 --> 26:24.658
Oh, any day now.

26:27.586 --> 26:30.168
Doctor says first one always runs to term.

26:30.255 --> 26:32.837
True. That's true.
Usually.

26:32.882 --> 26:34.292
And then some.

26:34.384 --> 26:36.215
They say the ﬁrst is the hardest.

26:36.303 --> 26:38.294
- Second pregnancy's worse in ways.
- Yeah?

26:38.305 --> 26:39.636
- Second pregnancy's worse in ways.
- Yeah?

26:39.681 --> 26:42.639
You know the pain at any moment
is less than what's coming.

26:42.684 --> 26:45.391
You know any potential complications.

26:45.478 --> 26:47.218
Might have been through some.

26:47.314 --> 26:49.930
And you know the moment that
tiny thing comes into the world,

26:50.025 --> 26:53.017
you're weaker because
you would die for him.

26:55.113 --> 26:56.694
Right now | just want her
the hell out of me.

26:56.740 --> 26:58.731
It's a girl?
Picked any names?

26:58.742 --> 27:00.403
It's a girl?
Picked any names?

27:00.493 --> 27:02.870
What is this, my shower?

27:07.709 --> 27:09.950
Walk me through it.

27:10.003 --> 27:11.994
Well, this boat
is a complicated beast.

27:12.005 --> 27:13.836
Well, this boat
is a complicated beast.

27:15.467 --> 27:17.458
You're saying
I'm simple?

27:17.552 --> 27:19.543
I'm saying I got to figure out how
to make all these wires down here

27:19.554 --> 27:22.512
I'm saying I got to figure out how
to make all these wires down here

27:22.599 --> 27:24.590
talk to all the wires up there.

27:24.601 --> 27:26.387
talk to all the wires up there.

27:29.481 --> 27:31.346
When Connor shows up, for your sake,

27:31.441 --> 27:32.977
I'd suggest you have it running.

27:33.068 --> 27:35.150
Now let's go.
Prove your value.

27:42.202 --> 27:44.113
There 's a guy on board,
knows how to rig the engine.

27:44.204 --> 27:46.661
We 're inbound.
Did you find the girl?

27:46.706 --> 27:49.368
- Alicia? Yes.
-/ look fon/vard to meeting her.

27:49.459 --> 27:51.074
Copy that.

28:00.387 --> 28:02.252
This where you sleep?

28:05.016 --> 28:07.007
Yeah. On deck when it's warm.

28:07.018 --> 28:08.428
Yeah. On deck when it's warm.

28:10.105 --> 28:11.641
This is where you talked to me?

28:12.899 --> 28:15.515
Was any of it true?

28:15.610 --> 28:17.441
Anything you told me?

28:17.529 --> 28:19.520
Versions of.

28:19.614 --> 28:21.980
What about your girlfriend?

28:23.952 --> 28:25.943
There's only one story about her.

28:25.954 --> 28:27.034
There's only one story about her.

28:27.080 --> 28:29.162
How long were you together?

28:29.249 --> 28:31.285
Three years.

28:31.376 --> 28:33.662
- What was her name?
- Alison.

28:37.340 --> 28:39.296
When my brother died,
Connor saved me.

28:39.384 --> 28:41.375
He-- he put me to use.

28:41.386 --> 28:42.466
He-- he put me to use.

28:43.805 --> 28:46.763
When someone saves
your life, you owe them.

28:46.808 --> 28:48.764
You just do.

28:48.810 --> 28:51.426
How many people came before me?

28:53.481 --> 28:55.563
How many are alive?

28:55.650 --> 28:58.437
I don't enjoy any of this, Alicia.

28:58.528 --> 29:00.644
You have to believe me.

29:00.739 --> 29:02.730
I'm sorry about
the one that Reed shot.

29:02.741 --> 29:03.947
I'm sorry about
the one that Reed shot.

29:10.749 --> 29:13.240
Strand wasn't any better than Reed.

29:16.463 --> 29:18.795
We've done worse on this boat.

29:26.139 --> 29:28.380
Maybe we found
each other for a reason.

29:32.145 --> 29:33.885
Come back with me.

29:36.441 --> 29:38.978
I could.

29:39.027 --> 29:40.983
With my family.

29:41.029 --> 29:43.441
Resources at our base
are precious.

29:43.531 --> 29:45.943
I can't abandon them.

29:45.992 --> 29:47.983
I want to stick my neck out for you,
but Connor doesn't invite just anyone.

29:47.994 --> 29:49.700
I want to stick my neck out for you,
but Connor doesn't invite just anyone.

29:49.788 --> 29:52.655
Back at your base,
l'll contribute.

29:52.749 --> 29:55.365
Tell Connor I'll help.

29:56.961 --> 29:58.917
I can be with you.

30:00.799 --> 30:02.835
If I know they're safe.

30:04.928 --> 30:06.884
You have to protect my family.

31:18.334 --> 31:20.666
VVhoa,hey,hey,
hey,hey,hey.

31:20.753 --> 31:22.368
Don't shoot.
Don't shoot.

31:29.262 --> 31:32.049
Strand sent me.
Strand.

31:32.098 --> 31:34.510
Look, look, look.

31:34.601 --> 31:36.216
Abigail.

31:38.646 --> 31:40.637
Okay?

31:42.066 --> 31:43.351
About time.

31:43.443 --> 31:44.979
Well, we had some boat trouble.

31:45.028 --> 31:46.893
Tss, tss, tss.
Off my porch.

31:50.867 --> 31:53.233
Hey, man, what the hell is this place?

31:53.286 --> 31:55.151
An Abigail home experience.

31:55.204 --> 31:57.115
Phase one was at 90% capacity.

31:57.165 --> 31:59.247
We were just about to break
ground on phase two.

31:59.292 --> 32:02.034
So why not just stay here?
You could secure the gate.

32:02.086 --> 32:04.202
Seems like a lonely place
to start the new world.

32:04.255 --> 32:06.246
Besides, I prefer Mexico.
Any other questions?

32:06.257 --> 32:09.090
Besides, I prefer Mexico.
Any other questions?

32:09.135 --> 32:11.751
You are the person getting all
of us across the border, right?

32:11.846 --> 32:13.711
Eh, if you tidy up.

32:13.806 --> 32:16.468
You're definitely not rubbing that
stench on my leather interiors.

32:18.561 --> 32:20.552
Why not? You gonna bring
your car on the boat?

32:20.647 --> 32:22.433
- Um, not the point.

32:22.523 --> 32:25.310
Do not touch the car.
Go ahead, just--

32:25.401 --> 32:27.653
use the last of the water pressure.

32:32.325 --> 32:34.566
Tss.

32:35.870 --> 32:37.451
What did you mean
by "all of us"?

32:41.250 --> 32:43.992
- Are you close?
- A little more time.

32:51.719 --> 32:53.710
One drink won't hurt
her once in a while.

32:53.721 --> 32:55.222
One drink won't hurt
her once in a while.

32:56.766 --> 32:58.722
| just like the smell.

32:58.810 --> 33:00.516
Good for you.

33:00.603 --> 33:03.219
Wish I could say the same.

33:03.272 --> 33:05.399
When '8 the last time
you felt her move?

33:07.610 --> 33:10.226
I'm on the go a lot.
I barely notice.

33:12.949 --> 33:15.031
I lost one

33:15.076 --> 33:16.612
between Nick and Alicia.

33:16.703 --> 33:19.319
One week her heart was
beating-- bap, bap, bap, bap.

33:19.414 --> 33:21.405
Too fast to count.

33:21.416 --> 33:22.656
Too fast to count.

33:22.750 --> 33:25.207
Next checkup,

33:25.253 --> 33:26.914
it just stopped.

33:27.005 --> 33:28.996
l'm healthy.
My kid's healthy.

33:29.007 --> 33:30.122
l'm healthy.
My kid's healthy.

33:30.174 --> 33:33.041
- Taking prenatal vitamins?
- As if I'm gonna find any.

33:33.094 --> 33:35.130
When exactly was the last
time you felt her move?

33:35.179 --> 33:37.295
Shut up.

33:37.348 --> 33:39.339
If she died,
she may have turned.

33:39.350 --> 33:40.430
If she died,
she may have turned.

33:40.518 --> 33:42.429
She'd feel that,
though, wouldn't she?

33:42.520 --> 33:44.511
If that thing was moving inside of her,
she would have probably felt that.

33:44.522 --> 33:45.637
If that thing was moving inside of her,
she would have probably felt that.

33:45.732 --> 33:48.018
- I said shut the hell up.
- Hey, hey, hey, hey.

33:51.779 --> 33:53.770
l'll shoot you and I'll
toss you overboard.

33:53.781 --> 33:55.317
l'll shoot you and I'll
toss you overboard.

33:55.366 --> 33:57.482
Don't tempt me.

33:59.328 --> 34:01.284
Problem?

34:01.330 --> 34:03.036
She's just trying
to get a rise out of me.

34:03.082 --> 34:04.583
Trying to?
Sit down.

34:04.667 --> 34:05.952
What will you do
if she's stillborn, Vida?

34:06.044 --> 34:08.035
- Bitch.
- What if she's born dead?

34:08.087 --> 34:10.578
- Hey!

34:10.673 --> 34:12.755
Connor might need her.

34:22.643 --> 34:24.099
They still gone?

34:24.145 --> 34:26.557
Damn!

34:26.647 --> 34:29.605
- My man's got some stamina.
- Enough with the boy.

34:29.692 --> 34:31.398
You want me to start
this engine or what?

34:48.086 --> 34:50.077
- Okay, okay, so how
difficult is just a few extra people?

34:50.088 --> 34:52.079
- Okay, okay, so how
difficult is just a few extra people?

34:52.090 --> 34:53.170
- Okay, okay, so how
difficult is just a few extra people?

34:53.216 --> 34:55.207
Well, it's not like adding
guests to a dinner reservation.

34:55.218 --> 34:56.628
Well, it's not like adding
guests to a dinner reservation.

34:56.719 --> 34:59.131
Okay? This was finely calibrated.
It took time.

34:59.180 --> 35:00.636
Okay, is there
any other way into Mexico?

35:00.723 --> 35:02.133
We got to go through the flotilla.

35:02.183 --> 35:04.674
l secured transit for two.

35:04.769 --> 35:06.725
I got money for two.

35:06.813 --> 35:08.269
Adding seven more, it's a problem.

35:08.314 --> 35:09.850
Okay, well, Strand must
have planned for us.

35:09.941 --> 35:11.431
Victor is impulsive.

35:11.526 --> 35:13.391
So you've known him a long time?

35:13.444 --> 35:14.524
- Victor?
- Yeah.

35:14.612 --> 35:16.603
Years.
Since he met Tom.

35:16.614 --> 35:17.820
Years.
Since he met Tom.

35:17.907 --> 35:20.444
- Thomas Abigail?
- Uh-huh.

35:20.493 --> 35:22.529
My mom works for the Abigails.

35:22.620 --> 35:24.702
For the father, now the son.

35:24.789 --> 35:26.825
She raised Tom and I together.

35:26.916 --> 35:28.781
She's staying at the Baja house now.

35:28.876 --> 35:30.616
Okay, so it is safe there.

35:30.711 --> 35:32.918
I mean, you wouldn't let your
mother stay if it weren't.

35:33.005 --> 35:34.996
You don't
know my mother, man.

35:35.007 --> 35:36.463
You don't
know my mother, man.

35:36.509 --> 35:38.420
My mother would be safe anywhere,

35:38.469 --> 35:40.460
in any world.

35:40.555 --> 35:42.671
Especially this one.

35:44.183 --> 35:45.684
Death is a way to new life.

35:53.776 --> 35:56.313
- Thanks, Celia.
- You're welcome.

35:56.362 --> 35:58.603
Did Luis arrive at the LA ofﬁces?

35:58.698 --> 36:00.939
Yes, his trip was uneventful.

36:01.033 --> 36:03.524
Ha. l'll join him tomorrow.

36:03.619 --> 36:05.780
Yes.

36:05.872 --> 36:07.863
You'll get yourself a sunburn, honey.

36:07.874 --> 36:09.785
You'll get yourself a sunburn, honey.

36:12.795 --> 36:15.537
She's not fond of me.

36:15.631 --> 36:17.587
Like son, like mother.

36:17.675 --> 36:20.166
Luis doesn't mind you.

36:20.219 --> 36:23.052
Ah, he tolerates me.

36:23.139 --> 36:25.300
l'll win him over
when | get back to the city.

36:28.769 --> 36:30.760
Thomas, before I present
to the council--

36:30.771 --> 36:32.511
Thomas, before I present
to the council--

36:32.607 --> 36:34.689
Oh, don't discuss business
when we're down here.

36:34.775 --> 36:36.936
We need to review. It's a
gorgeous tract of land and--

36:37.028 --> 36:39.440
Do not discuss business.

36:39.488 --> 36:42.025
Breathe.

36:42.116 --> 36:43.777
Look at it.

36:43.868 --> 36:45.904
It's not terrible, right?

36:47.413 --> 36:49.404
Sometimes knowing this exists

36:49.415 --> 36:50.700
Sometimes knowing this exists

36:50.791 --> 36:52.782
when l have to get back to reality

36:52.793 --> 36:55.284
when l have to get back to reality

36:55.338 --> 36:57.203
is terrible.

36:58.257 --> 37:00.043
Dontgo.

37:00.134 --> 37:02.216
Put back the council.

37:02.261 --> 37:04.252
You say that now, but if we don't
move on this parcel of land,

37:04.263 --> 37:05.423
You say that now, but if we don't
move on this parcel of land,

37:05.473 --> 37:07.464
someone else will
and you'll regret it.

37:07.475 --> 37:09.557
someone else will
and you'll regret it.

37:09.602 --> 37:11.968
We'll never want for anything.

37:13.731 --> 37:15.437
Savings.

37:15.483 --> 37:18.441
A home for Celia and Luis.

37:18.486 --> 37:20.477
These vistas for us.

37:20.488 --> 37:22.194
These vistas for us.

37:24.533 --> 37:27.240
This place makes me feel
like the rest of the world

37:27.286 --> 37:29.277
has fallen away
and we don't need it.

37:29.288 --> 37:32.200
has fallen away
and we don't need it.

37:53.688 --> 37:55.895
Good timing, Travis.

37:55.982 --> 37:58.064
Connor wants to meet you.

38:00.736 --> 38:02.647
Who are the others?

38:02.738 --> 38:04.353
Fdends.
Start her up.

38:04.407 --> 38:06.443
I can wait
until they board.

38:06.492 --> 38:08.824
I mean, if I start the engine,
it could give a bit of a jolt.

38:08.911 --> 38:11.243
Don't be such a pussy.
A boat like this purrs.

38:27.513 --> 38:30.220
This is a gorgeous vessel.

38:30.308 --> 38:31.764
Finally.

38:37.648 --> 38:39.639
- What happened?
- She hit her head.

38:39.734 --> 38:41.725
You couldn't clean her up?
Jesus, guys, come on.

38:41.736 --> 38:42.942
You couldn't clean her up?
Jesus, guys, come on.

38:43.029 --> 38:44.735
This is the one
who started the boat.

38:44.822 --> 38:46.813
Travis, you and Alicia
come with us.

38:46.824 --> 38:48.655
Travis, you and Alicia
come with us.

38:48.743 --> 38:50.734
- And my family?
- We only need the two of you.

38:50.745 --> 38:51.825
- And my family?
- We only need the two of you.

38:51.912 --> 38:53.994
- Wait, what are you talking about?
- Whoa, whoa, hey.

38:54.081 --> 38:56.072
- Whoa, whoa, what are you gonna do?
- Wait, no, Travis.

38:56.083 --> 38:57.664
- Whoa, whoa, what are you gonna do?
- Wait, no, Travis.

38:57.710 --> 38:58.995
You'll get them
a boat, right?

38:59.086 --> 39:00.462
Yeah, they'll get
them to shore.

39:00.504 --> 39:02.540
Fair enough.

39:02.590 --> 39:04.581
- Travis.
- It's okay, Maddy. I'll bring her back.

39:04.633 --> 39:07.420
- Dad, Dad, please. Dad.
- Stay with Maddy, Chris.

39:10.848 --> 39:12.759
- Dad.

39:16.479 --> 39:18.686
Come on. Come on, come on.

39:18.773 --> 39:20.855
Keep moving.

39:37.541 --> 39:40.499
Connor hasn 't quite
adapted to this world.

39:40.544 --> 39:42.535
He's got leadership skills,
holds us all together.

39:42.546 --> 39:44.457
He's got leadership skills,
holds us all together.

39:46.008 --> 39:48.499
Big heart,
strong mind.

39:51.639 --> 39:53.630
Weak stomach.

39:58.771 --> 40:00.432
Put us on the launch.

40:05.736 --> 40:07.272
We'll go to shore.

40:09.198 --> 40:11.189
You can take
the Abigail.

40:11.200 --> 40:12.440
You can take
the Abigail.

40:12.493 --> 40:14.484
The thing is, the launch goes
with this yacht, doesn't it?

40:14.495 --> 40:17.077
The thing is, the launch goes
with this yacht, doesn't it?

40:17.164 --> 40:19.951
We 7/ swim to shore.
Just let us.

40:20.042 --> 40:22.328
What if you want your boat back?
I don't like that ending.

40:22.420 --> 40:24.752
- Shh.
- Excuse me?

40:24.797 --> 40:26.333
Incoming.

40:30.010 --> 40:32.001
Hey, there's people
on board, man.

40:32.096 --> 40:34.007
They have guns.
There's people on the boat.

40:34.098 --> 40:35.759
Here, take the tiller.

40:35.850 --> 40:37.511
Let me check.

40:41.021 --> 40:42.852
The redhead one of yours?

40:42.940 --> 40:44.805
No, the ones who are armed,
they're not us.

40:44.900 --> 40:47.391
- Did Connor come back?
- Zodiac.

40:49.321 --> 40:51.983
- Looks like two--

40:55.035 --> 40:57.071
What?
Damn it.

40:59.832 --> 41:02.448
- Get him!

41:09.550 --> 41:11.882
- Chris, don't!

41:11.969 --> 41:13.880
Chris!

41:18.225 --> 41:20.682
- Mom. Hey.
- Nick, where were you?

41:20.728 --> 41:22.468
- Hey, drop it!
- Where's Victor?

41:22.521 --> 41:23.897
-Dmpm
- Whoa, whoa. Hey, hey.

41:23.981 --> 41:25.517
He's okay.
He's okay.

41:25.566 --> 41:27.682
He's a friend.
He helped.

41:27.735 --> 41:30.067
Strand sent me
to get Luis, okay?

41:30.154 --> 41:31.644
He's gonna help us
get into Mexico.

41:31.697 --> 41:34.359
l was getting Strand
into Mexico.

41:34.450 --> 41:35.906
He left
when they boarded,

41:35.993 --> 41:37.494
when they tried
to take the Abigail.

41:37.536 --> 41:40.528
- Victor escaped?
- They shot at his raft.

41:40.581 --> 41:42.321
He went down.

41:42.416 --> 41:44.407
I have to go after Travis.
l have to find Alicia.

41:44.418 --> 41:46.204
I have to go after Travis.
l have to find Alicia.

41:46.295 --> 41:47.831
We do not cross
the border without him.

41:47.922 --> 41:49.503
We don't need Strand.

41:49.548 --> 41:51.834
Well, he didn't need you
either, but here you are.

41:51.884 --> 41:54.466
Without Strand,
we don 't get into Mexico.

42:00.851 --> 42:03.228
You can't go up there.

42:03.312 --> 42:05.348
There's rioting
all over the country.

42:05.439 --> 42:06.940
Los Angeles
is no different.

42:07.024 --> 42:08.730
When there's blood
in the streets...

42:08.776 --> 42:11.108
I won't have your blood
on the streets.

42:11.195 --> 42:13.481
l'll close quick,
come right back.

42:14.698 --> 42:16.814
I'll be fine.

42:18.577 --> 42:21.569
There's been an outbreak.
People are dying.

42:22.915 --> 42:24.871
Two days.

42:24.917 --> 42:27.033
I'll be back
in two days.
