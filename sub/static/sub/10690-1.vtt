01:14.573 --> 01:17.726
Mickey, have a pee before you go!
In the toilet this time!

01:29.671 --> 01:31.281
Mickey! Move!

01:31.381 --> 01:35.869
- Don't sit on the back of the sofa.
- What? Whoa!

01:35.969 --> 01:37.246
Time to get a move on, OK?

01:37.346 --> 01:40.249
Scottish Granddad and his puppies
are waiting for us.

01:40.349 --> 01:44.101
Let me take this, let me...
Oh! Jeez, what the...

01:44.561 --> 01:47.438
Oh, for f... What's that?

01:47.564 --> 01:48.689
That's Eric.

01:49.650 --> 01:50.801
- Eric?
- Yes.

01:50.901 --> 01:53.444
He wants to come
to Scotland with us, too.

01:53.570 --> 01:55.806
Thing is, Eric's a wee bit heavy, and...

01:55.906 --> 01:59.575
Hang on, there's a... What's this?

02:00.494 --> 02:03.564
- That's Norman.
- That's... half a breeze block.

02:03.664 --> 02:07.359
- How did you even pick that up?
- I can't sleep without Norman.

02:07.459 --> 02:09.527
You sleep with... with this in your bed?

02:09.627 --> 02:13.490
No, that would be stupid!
He goes at the bottom of my bed

02:13.590 --> 02:16.577
to make sure the bad ones don't come in.

02:16.677 --> 02:20.789
- So there's bad stones and good stones?
- Yeah. Like in real life.

02:20.889 --> 02:22.374
Sure.

02:26.347 --> 02:30.314
- That's our car alarm!
- Oh, for God's sake!

02:31.900 --> 02:34.419
For Odin!

02:42.785 --> 02:45.162
Bloody thing.

02:47.207 --> 02:48.525
Bugger off.

02:54.965 --> 02:58.118
No, I'm sorry, darling,
we can't take Norman to Scotland.

02:58.218 --> 03:00.621
- Or Eric.
- Right, then I'm gonna hold my breath.

03:00.721 --> 03:03.931
No, no, no. Don't do that.
Jess, Jess. Jess, stop it. Jess. Jess.

03:05.559 --> 03:09.087
OK, they can come. Look?
Fine. See? They're coming, it's OK.

03:09.187 --> 03:11.230
Look, look, in they go, in the bag.

03:12.190 --> 03:14.025
So her best friends are stones now?

03:14.151 --> 03:16.094
Not all of them.
Some of them are bricks.

03:16.194 --> 03:19.431
Well, have you, you know,
have you spoken to anyone about it?

03:19.531 --> 03:22.267
What, like a geologist?
Oh, this thing hates me.

03:22.367 --> 03:25.729
I'm just saying that...
obsessive collecting,

03:25.829 --> 03:28.482
it's rather abnormal behaviour
for a child to...

03:28.582 --> 03:30.609
She's behaving abnormally?
I wonder why.

03:30.709 --> 03:32.444
For Christ's sake, Abi, just get...

03:32.544 --> 03:35.447
- OK, sweetie?
- Everything all right?

03:35.547 --> 03:38.049
- I need a list.
- A list?

03:38.175 --> 03:41.802
Yeah, of the lies we're going to tell.
In case I forget one.

03:44.222 --> 03:47.584
- That is a clove hitch.
- It's just a list would be helpful.

03:47.684 --> 03:51.338
- Has anyone seen my house keys?
- Oh, M25 slow moving between...

03:51.438 --> 03:53.590
- Keys, keys, keys.
- ...well, everywhere.

03:53.690 --> 03:55.592
It's just a list would be
really helpful.

03:55.692 --> 03:58.804
It's really very simple.
It's Granddad's 75th birthday party

03:58.904 --> 04:02.391
and we don't want to upset him
because he's been a bit poorly...

04:02.491 --> 04:04.909
He's getting better now.

04:05.994 --> 04:07.437
Yes, but...

04:07.891 --> 04:09.898
Oh, Jesus H Christ!

04:09.998 --> 04:12.901
Mummy, you're not supposed to
shout Jesus's name like that.

04:13.001 --> 04:15.862
No, that's all right,
it's cos I'm asking for His help.

04:15.962 --> 04:17.906
- To stop the car alarm?
- Yep.

04:18.005 --> 04:20.966
See? Thank you, Jesus.

04:21.802 --> 04:22.927
Come on, all aboard!

04:25.222 --> 04:27.624
- Enemies of Odin!
- I want the window seat!

04:27.724 --> 04:30.601
- Have you got your key?
- No, I gave you my key, remember?

04:30.727 --> 04:34.548
- Yeah. Yep.
- We can't leave the house unlocked.

04:34.648 --> 04:36.466
- No, I'm aware of that.
- Don't start.

04:36.566 --> 04:38.969
Nobody's starting.
You supervise the little ones.

04:39.069 --> 04:42.139
- Well, where are your keys?
- I think someone's hidden them.

04:42.239 --> 04:45.017
Oh, for f...
We've got to address this.

04:45.117 --> 04:47.118
- How many times?
- Don't start!

04:47.244 --> 04:49.313
- We're not starting, darling.
- OK.

04:49.413 --> 04:51.732
- Well, where are you going?
- Lucy.

04:51.832 --> 04:54.067
She won't let me put her seat belt on.

04:54.167 --> 04:56.528
- I don't like it!
- We've got to put it on.

04:56.628 --> 04:59.489
She'll be through the window screen
and cut into tiny pieces.

04:59.589 --> 05:03.076
Yes, thank you, Mickey.
Ooh, I've got a good idea.

05:03.176 --> 05:07.205
Why don't we ask Eric
if he knows how to put?

05:07.305 --> 05:09.958
- It is Norman, Mum.
- Norman, as I was saying,

05:10.058 --> 05:13.211
why don't we ask Norman if
he knows how to put a seat belt on?

05:13.311 --> 05:14.645
He's a breeze block!

05:14.771 --> 05:18.425
And he doesn't have arms! How could he
possibly put my seat belt on?

05:18.525 --> 05:20.010
Right, I'm putting it on.

05:20.110 --> 05:21.970
It's the stone that needs the seat belt.

05:22.070 --> 05:25.156
Because if we brake hard,
it will go straight through your head

05:25.282 --> 05:29.076
or Daddy's head if he's driving...
for your information.

05:31.705 --> 05:34.191
Oh, hi, Lucy.
Abi's managed to lose her keys

05:34.291 --> 05:36.542
and I need to lock up,
so could I borrow the spare?

05:37.919 --> 05:39.378
If you could just let me have...

05:42.799 --> 05:46.078
- Oh.
- Oh, no, Luce, it's fine.

05:46.178 --> 05:47.720
Oh, right.

05:52.309 --> 05:55.186
So, you're off on your travels.

05:55.312 --> 05:56.880
Yeah, to visit my dad.

05:56.980 --> 05:59.424
- You're driving all the way to Scotland?
- That's right.

05:59.524 --> 06:01.192
- Together?
- Yeah.

06:01.401 --> 06:02.844
700...

06:02.944 --> 06:05.196
We cannot drive to the
Highlands in one day.

06:05.322 --> 06:07.307
I told Gavin we'd be there tonight.

06:07.407 --> 06:10.268
- We haven't got a cat's hope in hell.
- We can share the driving.

06:10.368 --> 06:12.896
- What, with Jenson Button?
- Please don't argue.

06:12.996 --> 06:15.732
We're not arguing, darling,
we're discussing.

06:15.832 --> 06:17.901
This is how it starts.
You start discussing,

06:18.001 --> 06:21.086
- then end up shouting and screaming.
- Then the policeman comes.

06:22.255 --> 06:24.449
That was just a misunderstanding,
sweetheart.

06:24.549 --> 06:28.219
Sometimes when grown-ups
discuss things... very loudly,

06:28.345 --> 06:31.081
- people get the wrong ideas.
- He let me play with his Taser.

06:31.181 --> 06:34.167
- Well, he didn't let you.
- That was another misunderstanding.

06:34.267 --> 06:38.562
- He didn't say I couldn't.
- Did the electricity feel nice, Daddy?

06:39.606 --> 06:41.398
No, not nice.

06:45.237 --> 06:47.764
So, we're all going to have
a holiday together?

06:47.864 --> 06:50.642
Yeah, yep. It'll be lovely, won't it?

06:50.742 --> 06:55.856
Does that mean that Daddy's
gonna come and live with us again?

06:55.956 --> 06:59.192
Well, no, sweetheart,
we've been through all this, haven't we?

06:59.292 --> 07:00.861
- Oh, yeah.
- Hey?

07:00.961 --> 07:04.322
And the important thing to remember
is that Mummy and Daddy...

07:04.422 --> 07:06.283
both love you very much,

07:06.383 --> 07:11.913
but then sometimes a mummy and a daddy
reach a point where,

07:12.013 --> 07:13.264
well, things change,

07:13.390 --> 07:17.419
and then one of them finds that
they don't really love the other one

07:17.519 --> 07:21.047
like they used to,
and then, maybe because of that,

07:21.147 --> 07:24.634
the other one... makes a mistake.

07:24.734 --> 07:26.094
Like Lloyd's dad?

07:26.194 --> 07:29.306
Well, that was actually
quite a big mistake.

07:29.406 --> 07:31.782
Running over Lloyd's mum with his car,
that was...

07:31.908 --> 07:33.810
No, I'm talking about a smaller mistake

07:33.910 --> 07:36.521
where, well, one of them does
something that is...

07:36.621 --> 07:39.232
a little bit silly and selfish
with someone at work,

07:39.332 --> 07:41.693
so they find themselves
having rows and...

07:41.793 --> 07:46.031
getting cross, and then one of them
goes to someone called a solicitor

07:46.131 --> 07:48.909
and sometimes,
if one of them is getting angry...

07:49.009 --> 07:52.412
one of them tells his solicitor
to keep saying no to everything

07:52.512 --> 07:54.623
even though they know
they're in the wrong

07:54.723 --> 07:56.249
which means that even though

07:56.349 --> 07:59.586
a mummy and daddy love
the children very, very much...

07:59.686 --> 08:01.087
and always will...

08:01.187 --> 08:03.173
they just keep getting crosser and...

08:03.273 --> 08:06.218
crosser, until the mummy and daddy
start blaming each other

08:06.318 --> 08:09.429
for every tiny thing even though
none of this would be happening

08:09.529 --> 08:12.390
if the other one had just
listened to him in the first place.

08:12.490 --> 08:14.033
- Dad?
- Yes, Mickey?

08:15.285 --> 08:16.994
These are a bit tight.

08:20.999 --> 08:25.153
Dad! Dad! We've brought
your 12 o'clock pills!

08:25.253 --> 08:28.949
Oh, chase me round the loch
on water skis, why don't you?

08:29.049 --> 08:33.245
Only, you left them behind!
And, er... and it's 12 o'clock!

08:33.345 --> 08:35.871
Come on, you beauty! Come on!

08:35.972 --> 08:38.792
With his heart,
he is supposed to stay calm.

08:38.892 --> 08:42.546
I mean, how can anybody get
so worked up about fishing?

08:42.645 --> 08:44.589
Oh, Jesus!

08:44.689 --> 08:46.550
Never think of looking left and right?

08:46.650 --> 08:47.650
Dad!

08:52.697 --> 08:56.017
- Is this Scotland?
- No, darling, this is Watford.

08:57.661 --> 09:00.313
When Daddy wakes up,
are you gonna go, "I told you so,"

09:00.413 --> 09:02.274
cos of the traffic congestion?

09:02.374 --> 09:04.124
No, darling.

09:07.708 --> 09:10.198
She's not gonna say, "I told you so."

09:10.298 --> 09:11.741
Jess! What did you do that for?

09:11.841 --> 09:13.326
It's rude to wake someone up.

09:13.426 --> 09:16.580
- That's right.
- A million thousand...

09:19.224 --> 09:21.793
Oh, God. Look at this lot.

09:24.020 --> 09:25.437
Leave it.

09:26.523 --> 09:27.606
Abi's phone.

09:30.193 --> 09:32.596
Hang on. It's Leon.

09:32.696 --> 09:34.514
I'll call him back.

09:34.614 --> 09:36.808
She'll call you back.

09:36.908 --> 09:39.811
I feel car sick. Can I sit in the front?

09:39.911 --> 09:42.413
Next time we stop, sweetie.
If we're allowed to.

09:42.539 --> 09:45.191
In 50 metres, turn right.

09:45.291 --> 09:47.694
We can't bloody turn right,
there's no right turn.

09:47.794 --> 09:51.422
- She can't hear you. She's a robot.
- She is the most overpriced...

09:51.548 --> 09:52.741
Can we change the voice?

09:52.841 --> 09:55.118
Can we have it in Italian
like we did last time?

09:55.218 --> 09:56.995
No. That's how we ended up in Ipswich.

09:57.095 --> 10:00.498
But we can have it in African language,
say for example,

10:00.598 --> 10:03.001
- either like Chad or?
- Chad isn't a language.

10:03.101 --> 10:05.378
...Zimbabwe or Bahamas.

10:06.430 --> 10:10.133
- Or even Israelian.
- Oh, God, it's Gavin.

10:10.233 --> 10:12.385
Accept it,
we are not gonna get there tonight.

10:12.485 --> 10:14.813
The traffic always gets better
after Leeds. Hi, Gavin.

10:14.913 --> 10:16.407
Tell him we won't make it today.

10:17.407 --> 10:19.893
Yeah, it is safe me talking to you.
Abi's driving.

10:19.993 --> 10:21.353
Tell him.

10:21.453 --> 10:23.772
Because in England we let women drive.

10:23.872 --> 10:26.274
Tell him.

10:26.374 --> 10:30.002
No, we will make it tonight,
just probably quite late. OK.

10:30.837 --> 10:32.588
OK, bye. Bye-bye.

10:55.737 --> 11:00.308
Hello, I wondered
if Sir Donald was in. Thank you.

11:00.408 --> 11:02.143
We've got three bulimics.

11:02.243 --> 11:05.496
Do you think we should put them next
to the buffet or a long way from it?

11:06.122 --> 11:09.025
I think near the toilet's
probably more important.

11:09.125 --> 11:11.418
Do you know, I think Doreen...

11:12.545 --> 11:15.506
she'd be more comfortable
away from the top table.

11:15.632 --> 11:18.910
Maybe we should let your dad decide,
because she is one of his oldest...

11:19.010 --> 11:22.872
- Sir Donald. Gavin. Yeah.
- ...friends.

11:22.972 --> 11:24.874
Gavin.

11:24.974 --> 11:26.584
Gavin McLeod. Yeah.

11:26.684 --> 11:28.894
I hear you got a hole-in-one
at the 13th.

11:45.736 --> 11:49.489
Well, he won't be bothering us again.

11:51.292 --> 11:52.402
Just wait there, kids.

11:52.502 --> 11:56.281
I like being sick,
it's like being a fountain.

11:56.381 --> 11:58.616
- I was sickest most.
- No, I was.

11:58.716 --> 12:01.426
Thanks for stopping for the night.

12:02.345 --> 12:04.330
I just want to get there
as soon as possible.

12:04.430 --> 12:06.332
- No, I know.
- His T-shirt.

12:06.432 --> 12:08.710
His T-shirt was full of vomit
because of me.

12:08.810 --> 12:09.878
Listen, Doug...

12:13.898 --> 12:16.509
It's a draw. You both
produced an equal amount of sick.

12:16.609 --> 12:18.527
But I still won.

12:19.946 --> 12:23.475
Er... why are we putting ourselves
through all this?

12:23.575 --> 12:26.352
Maybe we should just
tell your dad the truth.

12:26.452 --> 12:28.605
No, no, it's too big a risk.

12:28.705 --> 12:31.248
It could really upset him,
the idea of us splitting.

12:32.584 --> 12:34.152
Please, Abi.

12:34.252 --> 12:37.405
He can't have long, let's just...

12:37.505 --> 12:39.256
Let's just let him have his party.

12:48.850 --> 12:53.228
Oh, Jesus Christ. No, no, no.

13:07.577 --> 13:11.397
Lottie, no one's gonna ask you if
Mum and me are living in the same house.

13:11.497 --> 13:13.817
Is there anything else
you've not told me?

13:13.917 --> 13:15.083
No.

13:16.544 --> 13:19.755
- Why are you writing that down?
- So you can't say you didn't say it.

13:20.465 --> 13:24.744
OK. Kids, just to remind...
Mickey, stop playing chip Jenga.

13:24.844 --> 13:28.164
Just to remind everyone, what we're
saying is, when we get to Scotland,

13:28.264 --> 13:33.143
nobody is to tell anyone that Mum and me
are living in different houses, OK?

13:33.269 --> 13:36.923
Can we tell them that you walked in
while the headmistress was doing a poo?

13:37.023 --> 13:38.341
It's not really...

13:38.441 --> 13:41.261
Can we tell them about tadpoles
turning into frogs?

13:41.361 --> 13:44.154
Absolutely. I think that'd be
an excellent conversation.

13:44.280 --> 13:46.724
That's a much better
topic of conversation.

13:46.824 --> 13:50.520
So as long as we're all agreed,
none of us mention anything about this.

13:50.620 --> 13:53.314
I wasn't gonna mention it anyway.
It's boring.

13:53.414 --> 13:55.165
- Exactly.
- It's lying.

13:55.291 --> 13:57.668
It's... It's not lying, it's not.

13:57.794 --> 14:00.822
It's not...
It's not mentioning something.

14:00.922 --> 14:03.741
What if someone asks,
"Are your mum and dad getting divorced?"

14:03.841 --> 14:08.095
You're visiting your granddad,
not going on The Jeremy Kyle Show.

14:10.098 --> 14:13.585
I hope we get another sunset tonight.
Last night was fantastic.

14:13.685 --> 14:17.229
It's the volcanic dust in the air
refracting the low-level sunlight.

14:18.314 --> 14:19.716
Really?

14:19.816 --> 14:22.552
I thought it was those new pills
the doctor's got me on.

14:22.652 --> 14:25.471
Must give you
a couple of packets of the blue ones.

14:25.571 --> 14:29.449
You can take them to school, sell them
to your friends, make a tidy wee profit.

14:32.996 --> 14:34.871
Play something.

14:42.839 --> 14:45.408
Nah, nah, nah.
Play the proper stuff.

14:45.508 --> 14:48.578
You know you like it.
And you've got to cut loose, Kenny.

14:48.678 --> 14:50.053
Go mental.

14:51.347 --> 14:53.958
Dad says I need to concentrate
on my exam pieces.

15:41.230 --> 15:43.466
In 50 metres, turn right.

15:44.379 --> 15:45.977
Right.

15:46.277 --> 15:48.179
Oh, Jesus.

15:48.905 --> 15:50.640
Why didn't you wake me?

15:50.740 --> 15:53.351
- You said it was rude.
- Not while I'm driving.

15:53.451 --> 15:54.435
What's happening?

15:54.535 --> 15:57.730
Daddy didn't like me
driving when he was asleep.

15:57.830 --> 16:00.358
- What? You were asleep?
- Is this Scotland?

16:00.458 --> 16:02.793
Do you mean you actually fell asleep?

16:02.919 --> 16:04.320
Not really.

16:04.420 --> 16:07.532
- Yeah, these are the Highlands.
- How high are the Highlands?

16:07.632 --> 16:10.801
- Were you sleeping?
- High. Higher than the Lowlands.

16:10.927 --> 16:12.469
Did you fall asleep?

16:51.300 --> 16:52.884
Puppies!

16:55.221 --> 16:57.290
Forgotten the way to Scotland then?

17:15.825 --> 17:17.951
So, Mickey, belated birthday present.

17:18.077 --> 17:20.453
I expect you can guess what it is.

17:20.579 --> 17:22.397
Is it a bicycle?

17:22.498 --> 17:25.834
Is it a... joke cushion that
stabs you in the bottom?

17:25.960 --> 17:27.627
- No, it is not.
- Is it a cow pie?

17:27.752 --> 17:28.863
Granddad!

17:28.963 --> 17:31.631
- Happy birthday!
- Hello, darling.

17:33.301 --> 17:34.926
Hey, Dad.

17:36.262 --> 17:37.580
- Gordie.
- Hello.

17:37.680 --> 17:40.875
- Happy birthday.
- Thanks very much.

17:40.975 --> 17:44.087
- How's things, Dad?
- Fine, fine, good.

17:44.187 --> 17:45.645
And how's things with you?

17:45.771 --> 17:47.215
- Fine.
- Brilliant, brilliant.

17:47.315 --> 17:48.481
I mean, super. More than.

17:48.608 --> 17:51.260
- Brilliant, tremendous.
- It is more fun actually. Fun.

17:51.360 --> 17:53.262
- Yeah.
- Isn't it? Yeah.

17:53.362 --> 17:56.364
- Really, really, really good.
- Right.

17:56.490 --> 17:59.602
- I did you a birthday card, Granddad.
- Oh, thanks, Lottie.

17:59.702 --> 18:01.828
She's got something of your mother.

18:01.954 --> 18:04.440
- Can he not play with that?
- Oh, Mickey!

18:04.540 --> 18:08.194
Sorry, I just wanted to show Granddad
the badger in the revolving doors

18:08.294 --> 18:09.669
and the nun with two heads.

18:09.795 --> 18:11.671
Nobody wants to see
a nun with two heads.

18:11.797 --> 18:14.200
- I do.
- That computer's not for kids.

18:14.300 --> 18:16.911
All the terminals are connected.
It's a...

18:17.011 --> 18:18.913
- Synergised system.
- That's right.

18:19.013 --> 18:21.541
You know, the whole house
is virtually wireless.

18:21.641 --> 18:24.017
It's, well, more than an iCloud, it's...

18:24.143 --> 18:26.228
iFog?

18:26.896 --> 18:28.631
It's an intelligent house.

18:28.731 --> 18:31.092
Is it as intelligent

18:31.192 --> 18:32.760
as a squid?

18:32.860 --> 18:36.029
- As a squid?
- Cos it can fit through a hole.

18:36.155 --> 18:37.473
It's intelligent in a way...

18:37.573 --> 18:40.601
- Can it draw a leopard?
- What?

18:40.701 --> 18:41.936
And can it do cartwheels?

18:42.036 --> 18:44.871
If this house is more intelligent
than you...

18:44.997 --> 18:47.608
- Mickey.
- This system cost a lot of money.

18:47.708 --> 18:50.877
Well, it doesn't always mean
it's intelligent if...

18:51.003 --> 18:52.879
- It cost loads of money.
- Yeah.

18:53.005 --> 18:54.824
You're not explaining it at all well.

18:54.924 --> 18:59.954
I think we should take you to
the headmaster of your place

19:00.054 --> 19:02.222
- because...
- It's an intelligent house, OK?

19:04.350 --> 19:05.960
You know, it's connected.

19:06.060 --> 19:07.352
Let there be light.

19:09.730 --> 19:13.176
Now then, clan of McLeod,
if you'll excuse me...

19:16.696 --> 19:19.098
Where are the keys?
They were there a moment ago.

19:19.198 --> 19:22.101
Who could have taken them?

19:22.201 --> 19:23.285
I don't know.

19:25.204 --> 19:26.413
Magpies?

19:30.126 --> 19:31.710
Magpies?

19:32.878 --> 19:36.923
This is my domain.
Only special people come here.

19:39.218 --> 19:40.218
After you, my dear.

19:43.055 --> 19:44.889
Ta-dah!

19:54.817 --> 19:59.612
Jess? This is insane!
I only asked you where the keys were.

19:59.739 --> 20:02.892
Jessie, Jessie, just breathe,
take a big, big breath.

20:02.992 --> 20:04.352
A big, deep breath.

20:04.452 --> 20:06.729
- She holds her breath?
- Yeah.

20:06.829 --> 20:10.024
Well. She can't do herself
too much harm, eh?

20:10.124 --> 20:13.027
Well, actually...

20:13.127 --> 20:15.571
Till she blacks out? Unconscious?

20:15.671 --> 20:20.300
That's quite extreme, isn't it?
To hold your breath that long.

20:20.426 --> 20:23.428
Well, she can always become
a pearl diver.

20:28.267 --> 20:29.517
Where's Sir Donald gone?

20:29.643 --> 20:33.422
Have you noticed anything odd
about Doug and Abi?

20:33.522 --> 20:36.149
Hey, what have you done to that helmet?

20:36.275 --> 20:37.984
I took the horns off it.

20:38.819 --> 20:40.653
London manners. Eh?

20:40.780 --> 20:45.059
Doug can't control them.
And as for her...

20:45.159 --> 20:48.453
That's what happens when
you marry someone too clever.

20:53.042 --> 20:55.111
That's me when I was 20.

20:55.211 --> 20:56.961
Only my skin was a little less orange.

21:00.508 --> 21:02.243
Is that you with the monkey?

21:02.343 --> 21:05.178
Yeah, that was my 30th birthday
in Northern Rhodesia.

21:05.304 --> 21:08.515
- We were looking for silver.
- Kneel before mighty Odin!

21:08.641 --> 21:11.184
Do you not get birthdays
after you're 75?

21:11.310 --> 21:12.253
What?

21:12.353 --> 21:16.689
Dad said to Mum it's going to be
Granddad's last birthday. I heard him.

21:17.900 --> 21:19.760
Ooh, Blu-Tack. Can I have this?

21:19.860 --> 21:23.264
Sure. Tell you what, why don't you
go check out on the puppies?

21:23.364 --> 21:25.308
- See if they're OK.
- Sure.

21:25.408 --> 21:27.158
I'm building a big...

21:33.040 --> 21:35.234
You've heard of cancer?

21:35.334 --> 21:37.695
Well, I've got that.

21:37.795 --> 21:39.655
But you will get better.

21:39.755 --> 21:43.049
Well, actually, no,
they can't make me any better

21:43.175 --> 21:45.119
and the treatments
they've been giving me

21:45.219 --> 21:47.512
have been putting
a terrible strain on my heart.

21:51.517 --> 21:56.521
But right now,
right this second, I feel brilliant.

21:59.233 --> 22:02.193
- What is this?
- It's my notebook.

22:03.362 --> 22:05.431
You know, Lottie,

22:05.531 --> 22:09.242
a lot of life doesn't look very good
written down.

22:10.035 --> 22:13.189
So, cousin Kenneth
is the one who took the keys?

22:13.289 --> 22:14.815
Yeah, isn't he a naughty boy?

22:14.915 --> 22:17.459
And where did cousin Kenneth
put the keys?

22:21.630 --> 22:22.630
Right.

22:22.756 --> 22:24.492
- Lost something?
- No.

22:24.592 --> 22:26.869
Ready for football?

22:26.969 --> 22:30.539
Leon, hi. No, still very keen.

22:30.639 --> 22:33.141
- Oh, nice header.
- Yeah, all right. Yeah.

22:33.267 --> 22:35.002
- It's mine!
- Hey?

22:35.102 --> 22:36.561
Oh! There you go.

22:37.021 --> 22:38.839
Maybe your parents just lied
to protect you.

22:38.939 --> 22:41.967
- Do you ever lie?
- Well, I've told lots of lies.

22:42.067 --> 22:44.303
Lots and lots of lies.
I always lied to policemen

22:44.403 --> 22:46.180
who said, "What speed were you going?"

22:46.280 --> 22:49.282
I say, "30mph," when I was clearly
doing much faster than that.

22:51.744 --> 22:53.786
And I don't care.

22:56.165 --> 23:01.169
Sometimes, if your intentions
are good, it's OK to lie.

23:01.295 --> 23:04.698
And if you don't like
someone's food at someone's house,

23:04.798 --> 23:06.867
and you say, "This is great,"
even though...

23:06.967 --> 23:10.178
That's what you do. You don't say,
"My God, I think I'm gonna vomit here."

23:11.873 --> 23:15.751
What you're saying is,
it's OK to lie to some people sometimes?

23:15.851 --> 23:17.336
Yeah, it's also good fun.

23:17.436 --> 23:18.853
For instance...

23:20.105 --> 23:22.941
Maybe we can find him in here.
George Judd.

23:24.443 --> 23:25.845
There he is, that's him there.

23:25.945 --> 23:29.223
When he told him there was an
elephant leech clinging to his bollocks,

23:29.323 --> 23:31.434
he got such a fright,
he completely fainted.

23:34.495 --> 23:36.856
- Is that you?
- No, I'm the wee one.

23:36.956 --> 23:38.790
So who's that?

23:44.296 --> 23:45.906
How could I forget?

23:46.006 --> 23:49.076
Dip me in vinegar
and call me a fish supper.

23:49.176 --> 23:52.371
I have here
a chocolate model of the Alps.

23:52.471 --> 23:54.347
Ta-dah!

23:55.808 --> 23:59.852
Here he comes, weaving his magic.

23:59.979 --> 24:01.922
And he's clean through...

24:02.022 --> 24:04.550
- Foul!
- Come on! I hardly touched you!

24:04.650 --> 24:06.359
And so it begins.

24:06.485 --> 24:08.361
Kenneth, your ball!

24:08.487 --> 24:10.806
- Oh, for Christ's sake!
- Gavin!

24:10.906 --> 24:13.366
What is wrong with you?
For crying out loud.

24:13.867 --> 24:16.479
- Mickey, this is your ball!
- I'm a Berserker!

24:16.579 --> 24:18.538
Will you stop being a Berserker?

24:18.664 --> 24:20.816
- And England are rattled.
- I'm not England.

24:20.916 --> 24:23.543
You're so English,
you're practically French.

24:23.669 --> 24:27.547
Oh, no! I think I see
a marauding Berserker!

24:27.673 --> 24:28.808
Help!

24:29.508 --> 24:31.759
- That would have killed me.
- I've killed you!

24:31.885 --> 24:34.387
But I moved my heart
to the other side, thank goodness.

24:34.513 --> 24:36.556
- You can't.
- You can when you're Scottish.

24:36.682 --> 24:39.559
- You've got a movable heart.
- You're dead.

24:39.685 --> 24:41.629
Jess! Kick it in the goal!

24:41.729 --> 24:43.172
Kenneth, you spaz!

24:43.272 --> 24:45.132
Gavin, please!

24:45.232 --> 24:48.735
Get the bloody ball! She's gonna score!

24:52.197 --> 24:54.741
Jess! Oh, God. Jess, are you OK?

24:54.867 --> 24:57.353
- Darling!
- I'm so sorry, Jess.

24:57.453 --> 24:58.854
- I'm sorry.
- It's all right.

24:58.954 --> 25:01.315
- I'm really, really sorry.
- It wasn't your fault.

25:01.415 --> 25:03.791
No, no, it was his fault.

25:03.917 --> 25:05.793
- Is she OK?
- No harm done.

25:05.919 --> 25:07.754
Come on, let's get you some ice cream.

25:09.548 --> 25:10.715
I'll make you a hot chocolate...

25:12.468 --> 25:14.427
I'm just gonna take this penalty.

25:15.721 --> 25:18.264
- Did you really play for Scotland?
- Aye, I did.

25:18.390 --> 25:19.833
Just the once, against Cyprus.

25:19.933 --> 25:22.211
- Did you score?
- I certainly did.

25:22.311 --> 25:26.715
A cracking header into the top corner...
of my own net.

25:26.815 --> 25:29.817
That's probably why
you only played once.

25:29.943 --> 25:33.514
Somebody going to go in goal? Gavin?

25:33.614 --> 25:35.891
So how are you feeling?

25:35.991 --> 25:39.728
Really, really pissed off
with this dying thing.

25:39.828 --> 25:43.831
Terribly, utterly
100 percent pissed off.

25:43.957 --> 25:45.333
Like millions before me.

25:46.794 --> 25:50.573
You could look on the bright side.
You dodged Alzheimer's.

25:51.670 --> 25:53.257
Gavin!

25:53.759 --> 25:57.746
This morning I was thinking of Doug
when he was Jess's age.

25:57.846 --> 26:01.250
I used to tickle him
and he'd go, "No, no, no!"

26:01.350 --> 26:04.811
Then when I was finished,
he'd go, "More, more, more, more!"

26:04.937 --> 26:08.106
Which sums up
exactly how I feel about living.

26:10.651 --> 26:12.110
One-all.

26:12.611 --> 26:16.614
Right, time, everybody! Margaret!

26:19.785 --> 26:20.936
The keys are back.

26:23.706 --> 26:27.333
Uncle Gavin, are you rich?
This place is enormous.

26:27.459 --> 26:30.070
No, no, no. Comfortable.

26:30.170 --> 26:34.507
This isn't actually...
This is owned by my company, not by me,

26:34.633 --> 26:36.384
so I use, like, a tax wrapper...

26:36.510 --> 26:39.204
- Are you like a tax man?
- No. No, no...

26:39.304 --> 26:40.847
What is your actual job then?

26:40.973 --> 26:43.292
Well... I have an interest in a fund...

26:43.392 --> 26:46.920
- So you're a banker?
- No. No, I work with banks...

26:47.020 --> 26:50.356
Dad said bankers are scum.

26:50.482 --> 26:54.053
Did I say? Well...
I might have done, yeah.

26:54.153 --> 26:56.805
Would you ever have thought
that you would own this house

26:56.905 --> 26:58.865
if you were not a banker?

26:58.991 --> 27:01.727
- I'm not a banker.
- Yeah, Gav. What is your actual job?

27:01.827 --> 27:04.370
- What is scum?
- I use money to make money.

27:04.496 --> 27:07.107
- That doesn't make sense.
- Margaret!

27:07.207 --> 27:09.876
When will we ever get
this answer out of you?

27:10.002 --> 27:11.919
I'm giving you the answer, you're not...

27:12.045 --> 27:14.922
- Is it gonna be the 12th of July?
- Enough.

27:15.048 --> 27:18.551
- I'm a short seller.
- You sell shorts?

27:19.094 --> 27:20.219
A short sailor?

27:21.054 --> 27:24.557
Not a short sailor, a short seller.

27:24.683 --> 27:28.253
Your friends, do they sell shoes,
socks, hairpieces?

27:28.353 --> 27:30.506
What sort of millionaire are you?

27:30.606 --> 27:33.441
OK, I've got lots of money, OK?
Lots of money!

27:33.567 --> 27:36.845
I've got shares, I've got property,
I've got gold.

27:36.945 --> 27:39.098
I've got lots of money! Can we just?

27:39.198 --> 27:40.948
Margaret!

27:54.296 --> 27:57.616
If this has got another two minutes,
we're gonna get obese.

27:57.716 --> 28:01.219
I can even feel myself
getting obese now.

28:02.304 --> 28:04.764
Sweetie, that's...

28:04.890 --> 28:07.126
This is killing me.

28:07.226 --> 28:09.477
Right now,
do you realise this is killing me?

28:11.230 --> 28:13.105
You should have told me about Granddad.

28:13.232 --> 28:14.941
I'm sorry.

28:16.735 --> 28:19.237
You and Mum need to stop lying.

28:26.954 --> 28:29.622
If you didn't lie so much,
maybe you'd still be together.

28:29.748 --> 28:31.316
Bravo!

28:31.416 --> 28:34.695
And maybe Mum wouldn't be on the phone
to her solicitor all night

28:34.795 --> 28:37.364
banging on about breaches
and leave to remove.

28:37.464 --> 28:38.506
More!

28:42.803 --> 28:44.595
Wasn't that great?

29:32.686 --> 29:34.213
Sorry, I shouldn't have...

29:34.313 --> 29:37.299
Kenneth, darling, it's fine.

29:37.399 --> 29:41.527
This, it's just something women do
when they get a bit older.

29:41.653 --> 29:43.529
It's perfectly normal.

29:43.655 --> 29:46.699
Just letting off a bit of steam.

29:47.910 --> 29:51.370
Is this about the... incident?

29:52.831 --> 29:56.485
Incident? What incident?

29:56.585 --> 29:59.378
Mum, it's on YouTube.

30:11.975 --> 30:14.852
- Leave to remove?
- I need the toilet.

30:18.982 --> 30:21.260
- Doug!
- I texted my solicitor.

30:21.360 --> 30:22.469
I'm dying for a pee.

30:22.569 --> 30:25.138
You're planning to take
my children away, aren't you?

30:25.238 --> 30:29.325
- Somewhere that's...
- Newcastle, OK? Newcastle, right?

30:30.494 --> 30:33.146
- Now is not the time to talk about it.
- When is a good time?

30:33.246 --> 30:34.747
When I'm not on the toilet.

30:38.752 --> 30:40.028
- Newcastle?
- Yeah.

30:40.128 --> 30:43.073
You're seriously gonna take my children
to live in Newcastle?

30:43.173 --> 30:45.993
- I'm thinking about it.
- Have you told the kids?

30:46.093 --> 30:49.413
- You found this?
- Yeah.

30:49.513 --> 30:53.375
I think it's a king's brooch because
it's got the Tree of Life on it.

30:53.475 --> 30:55.836
Is it true you're a Viking?
Cos Dad said you were.

30:55.936 --> 30:59.730
Oh, yeah. University Hospital
were doing DNA tests

30:59.856 --> 31:02.050
and wanted volunteers.

31:02.150 --> 31:04.636
And seeing as they were
forever taking my blood anyway,

31:04.736 --> 31:07.196
seems I'm 84 percent Viking.

31:09.783 --> 31:11.367
That's most of me.

31:19.459 --> 31:22.905
Look, come on. I thought we agreed
that this weekend was about your dad

31:23.005 --> 31:26.158
and we'd put all personal issues
on hold. We agreed, didn't we?

31:26.258 --> 31:28.327
- Yeah.
- Then unlock the bloody door.

31:28.427 --> 31:30.829
- How would I see the kids?
- You'd come to Newcastle.

31:30.929 --> 31:32.414
- What?
- A few hours on the train.

31:32.514 --> 31:34.765
- Four hours at least.
- Three hours 12 minutes.

31:34.891 --> 31:37.377
- Nearly seven hours there and back.
- Will you let me out?

31:37.477 --> 31:39.588
- Every weekend, seven hours?
- I'd like to leave, please.

31:39.688 --> 31:42.273
Weekends would be much worse,
they do engineering work.

31:42.399 --> 31:44.468
I'd spend my life
on a bus replacement service.

31:44.568 --> 31:46.678
- Let me out.
- You're doing this out of revenge.

31:46.778 --> 31:49.806
Either behave in a mature and adult way

31:49.906 --> 31:52.434
or I scream "rape" out of this window.

31:52.534 --> 31:55.619
Oh, not that again.

31:56.413 --> 31:58.982
Why did you pull the
horns off your helmet?

31:59.082 --> 32:01.193
Cos it's historically incorrect.

32:01.293 --> 32:03.236
Cos Viking helmets didn't have horns.

32:03.336 --> 32:06.797
But they didn't have two holes
in them there and there, did they?

32:06.923 --> 32:09.076
They did if they fell off a cliff
onto a stag.

32:09.176 --> 32:10.494
I never thought of that.

32:10.594 --> 32:12.079
What if somebody threw a spear?

32:12.179 --> 32:15.165
It could have gone through the side
and out the other side.

32:15.265 --> 32:18.434
But that would hit the helmet though,
wouldn't it?

32:19.770 --> 32:21.713
You know,
my favourite Norse god is Odin.

32:21.813 --> 32:23.340
Is it? Why's that?

32:23.440 --> 32:28.637
Because he's got these, ravens
called Memory and something else.

32:28.737 --> 32:29.779
What did they do?

32:31.531 --> 32:34.101
- They're ravens.
- And that's a job, is it?

32:34.201 --> 32:35.826
- They're really dangerous.
- Ooh.

32:35.952 --> 32:38.271
- I pray to him sometimes.
- You pray to Odin?

32:38.371 --> 32:42.124
Yeah. He roams the world
testing people's hospitality.

32:43.001 --> 32:46.337
Well, in the mortal world,
we have a word for that. "Scrounging."

32:54.137 --> 32:56.138
Happy 75th birthday.

33:03.105 --> 33:04.756
They're fine.

33:04.856 --> 33:07.691
And they don't live
in different houses by the way.

33:22.207 --> 33:25.152
I'll be running, well,
all the important stuff.

33:25.252 --> 33:28.321
Margaret, I've got you
on the flowers, the food,

33:28.421 --> 33:31.382
the signage and the cloakroom.
And the taxis.

33:32.759 --> 33:37.388
And the photographer. Doug, I need you
to set up the marquee for the band.

33:37.514 --> 33:39.291
Hello. And set up the tables.

33:39.391 --> 33:42.586
Kenneth is on parking and conage.

33:42.686 --> 33:44.713
I'm going to West Beach
with Dad and the kids.

33:44.813 --> 33:48.300
I think not.
214 guests we've got coming.

33:48.400 --> 33:50.552
- 214?
- 215.

33:50.652 --> 33:53.055
- Patsy Cameron found a man on the internet.
- Too late.

33:53.155 --> 33:55.515
Although Jimmy Cazerotto's
stuck in New Zealand.

33:55.615 --> 33:57.809
- Dad can't manage the kids.
- I'm not senile.

33:57.909 --> 34:01.021
No, but what if...
Mickey, put the puppy back.

34:01.121 --> 34:05.525
- Dad, it is your birthday...
- And this is how I'd like to spend it.

34:05.625 --> 34:08.070
And we don't want to upset him. Do we?

34:08.170 --> 34:11.822
- We'll be back by seven.
- Well, no, you need to be back bef...

34:11.922 --> 34:14.242
So that's agreed then.
I'll take my mobile.

34:14.342 --> 34:15.744
- Come on, kids.
- Yes!

34:15.844 --> 34:17.136
But, Dad...!

34:19.054 --> 34:21.931
Gordie, are you sure
you're up... for this?

34:22.058 --> 34:24.753
It's... Margaret said
your medications make you feel...

34:24.853 --> 34:26.963
I'm giving the medications a rest today.

34:27.063 --> 34:28.340
Oh, well, is that a good...

34:28.440 --> 34:31.065
No need to worry,
I've carried out a risk assessment.

34:32.610 --> 34:34.987
No, I haven't. It's a joke.

34:36.864 --> 34:38.699
Remember jokes?

34:59.304 --> 35:01.096
Hey!

35:03.642 --> 35:07.671
Are you not stopping to say hello,
you miserable old bastard?

35:07.771 --> 35:10.257
Jesus, Doreen,
can you not mind your language?

35:10.357 --> 35:11.550
They're only weans.

35:11.650 --> 35:12.983
She's got animals!

35:13.109 --> 35:14.944
What's the matter with you?

35:16.154 --> 35:18.431
I'm just saying go easy on the swearing.

35:18.531 --> 35:20.991
They're from London,
everybody swears in London.

35:21.117 --> 35:23.728
Mum and Dad swear all the time.

35:23.828 --> 35:26.439
- Well, maybe so, but...
- Mum used the c-word.

35:26.539 --> 35:29.234
- And the other ones.
- OK, but...

35:29.334 --> 35:35.547
"Tell that to your poxy effing c-word
of a solicitor, you effing b-word."

35:37.342 --> 35:39.536
She thought I was in the garden

35:39.636 --> 35:42.956
but I was in the toilet
peeing very quietly

35:43.056 --> 35:46.725
by aiming for the side of the toilet
but not the water.

35:49.396 --> 35:50.646
Though I did miss a bit.

35:51.398 --> 35:53.341
- Right.
- She's got goats!

35:53.441 --> 35:55.067
I'm coming!

35:57.153 --> 35:58.237
And pigs!

36:03.743 --> 36:05.327
I wonder what's in here.

36:07.247 --> 36:09.858
- Shall we have a look?
- Whoa, look at the size of him!

36:09.958 --> 36:13.570
- They're like massive chickens.
- They look like meerkats.

36:14.270 --> 36:16.559
Only with no arms.

36:17.674 --> 36:20.050
I'm gonna race one.

36:20.176 --> 36:22.913
You've got an escapee
charging about like a loony

36:23.013 --> 36:25.180
- down by the burn.
- That'll be Wiggins.

36:26.891 --> 36:30.086
- How are you feeling today?
- Oh, I'm fine.

36:30.186 --> 36:31.603
It's one of my good days.

36:32.480 --> 36:35.300
You are such a crap actor.

36:35.400 --> 36:40.753
Come on! Call yourselves ostriches?
I'm a lion! Come on! Race me!

36:42.490 --> 36:46.603
So this came out of a ostrich's bottom?

36:46.703 --> 36:48.396
That's why they're so bad tempered.

36:48.496 --> 36:51.707
Could you get an ostrich egg
and push it back up its bottom?

36:52.417 --> 36:53.777
No, I don't think so.

36:53.877 --> 36:56.613
Because you'd have to
hold the ostrich still

36:56.713 --> 36:58.865
and nobody's gonna volunteer for that.

36:58.965 --> 37:01.701
I reckon you could get it
halfway up the crack.

37:01.801 --> 37:02.827
You could push it up.

37:02.927 --> 37:05.789
If you caught it halfway,
you think you could push it back up?

37:05.889 --> 37:07.916
- Yeah.
- Next time one's going to lay,

37:08.016 --> 37:10.835
- I'll get in touch with you.
- One little push like...

37:10.935 --> 37:14.271
- Like a volleyball.
- Right.

37:15.023 --> 37:19.219
Look, I know your mum and dad
are going through a difficult time.

37:19.319 --> 37:21.721
So you know what's happening to them?

37:21.821 --> 37:24.990
- I put two and two together.
- So you know they're getting divorced?

37:27.243 --> 37:30.496
Well, no, I didn't know that.

37:32.374 --> 37:38.363
Look, Lottie, people sometimes change
but they still love you, both of them.

37:38.463 --> 37:41.157
You'll see.
They'll muddle through this eventually.

37:41.257 --> 37:44.160
- Dad had an affair.
- Right, er...

37:44.260 --> 37:47.163
With a Paralympic athlete lady
with one foot.

37:47.263 --> 37:50.182
I probably don't need to know
all the details.

37:51.518 --> 37:53.211
Do you look after
the ostriches on your own?

37:53.311 --> 37:55.714
- No, Morag helps me.
- Who's Morag?

37:55.814 --> 37:58.148
- She's my girlfriend.
- Oh, for goodness' sake!

37:58.274 --> 38:00.093
- What?
- You could have said "friend".

38:00.193 --> 38:03.346
Girlfriend? Boys have girlfriends.

38:03.446 --> 38:05.307
Now we have to explain the whole thing.

38:05.407 --> 38:08.450
Fine, I'll explain.

38:09.494 --> 38:12.856
- Do you know what a lesbian is?
- Is it someone from Lesbia?

38:12.956 --> 38:17.861
That's right, Mickey.
I am from the magical kingdom of Lesbia.

38:17.961 --> 38:20.864
You're just gonna confuse them
even more!

38:20.964 --> 38:25.968
Margaret! There's a wrong
apostrophe on the toilet signage!

38:27.554 --> 38:31.374
- What the hell? Newcastle.
- It's a vibrant, growing city

38:31.474 --> 38:36.087
- with a great... public transport hub.
- But it's hundreds of miles...

38:36.187 --> 38:38.298
The Tyne is the best salmon river
in Britain

38:38.398 --> 38:40.425
and otters have been seen in Gateshead.

38:40.525 --> 38:42.552
- Abi, listen.
- There's lots of castles.

38:42.652 --> 38:45.472
Around Newcastle. Kids love castles.

38:45.572 --> 38:48.532
Bamburgh Castle, Dunstanburgh,
Alnwick, Holy Island.

38:48.658 --> 38:50.852
Is this job
with the Newcastle tourist board?

38:50.952 --> 38:54.705
- I'm just saying, it's...
- Abi, please.

38:54.831 --> 38:56.540
Please. Don't take them away.

39:00.044 --> 39:02.463
Margaret needs this heather.

39:03.715 --> 39:05.533
Margaret?

39:05.633 --> 39:07.176
Margaret!

39:20.273 --> 39:22.425
Granddad, your mobile's turned off.

39:22.525 --> 39:24.302
Aye, that's the way I like it.

39:24.402 --> 39:28.530
And the batteries are dead,
just to make sure.

39:29.407 --> 39:32.284
Oh, just look at that. Look at it.

39:39.080 --> 39:41.412
- Bless you.
- Lovely manners.

39:42.712 --> 39:44.447
Can we drive for a bit?

39:44.547 --> 39:47.200
- Don't be stupid. Kids can't...
- Yes, you can drive.

39:47.300 --> 39:48.535
Mickey, toot the horn.

39:49.614 --> 39:53.498
Jess, you're the look-out. Stick your
head out and shout, "Look out!"

39:53.598 --> 39:56.501
- Look out!
- Lottie, you steer.

39:57.579 --> 39:59.712
What? But I... I can't...

39:59.812 --> 40:04.717
When I press this pedal on the floor
that makes it go, then it's down to you.

40:04.817 --> 40:06.540
What? But I...

40:07.570 --> 40:09.597
Left a bit. Left a bit.

40:09.697 --> 40:12.100
But it's not allowed.
I'm ten, I'm not insured.

40:12.200 --> 40:14.394
I don't care.

40:14.494 --> 40:16.954
That's good. Left, left. That's lovely.

40:18.706 --> 40:21.985
- I don't think that...
- You need to live more and think less.

40:22.085 --> 40:25.947
- More right, more right! Oh!
- Lottie!

40:26.047 --> 40:28.575
Well done!
I've been trying to hit that for years.

40:28.675 --> 40:32.328
- What did it say?
- It said "Do not let children drive".

40:54.659 --> 40:55.826
Yay!

40:57.537 --> 40:59.617
We might see a killer whale.

41:23.605 --> 41:25.606
Don't go on those rocks!

41:28.610 --> 41:31.528
I found a pebble!

41:46.002 --> 41:48.003
Is it nice being a lesbian?

41:49.505 --> 41:51.115
What the hell are you asking me for?

41:51.215 --> 41:54.577
I suppose it must be, otherwise
they wouldn't be one, would they?

41:57.055 --> 41:59.541
How do people know what they are?

41:59.641 --> 42:01.709
Well, they just kind of find out.

42:01.809 --> 42:05.937
We all find out eventually what we are.
Then the world has to lump it.

42:07.774 --> 42:10.051
Can lesbians make babies?

42:10.151 --> 42:12.637
Er... Well, er...

42:12.737 --> 42:15.473
Why don't you nip over there
and get some wood for the fire

42:15.573 --> 42:19.477
- at the old Viking burial mound?
- That's a Viking burial mound?

42:19.577 --> 42:20.952
Yeah. So they say.

42:22.288 --> 42:24.247
That's where I found the brooch.

42:32.965 --> 42:34.784
Are you OK, Granddad?

42:34.884 --> 42:37.344
Aye, indigestion, princess.

42:38.304 --> 42:40.665
I've had it all my life.
Don't chew enough.

42:40.765 --> 42:44.059
Granddad! I've lost my pebble.

42:45.853 --> 42:47.771
Right.

42:51.401 --> 42:55.487
I'll race you! Look out for jellyfish.

43:00.076 --> 43:03.146
- Is this official?
- Is what official?

43:03.246 --> 43:05.648
What it says on this rock.

43:05.748 --> 43:09.235
"Keep off. F and G's beach."

43:09.335 --> 43:11.654
Oh, God.

43:11.754 --> 43:13.740
I carved that.

43:13.840 --> 43:18.202
Well, I helped. Actually I didn't do
all that much, I was only small.

43:18.302 --> 43:21.831
- Frazer did most of it.
- Who's Frazer?

43:21.931 --> 43:24.000
He was my big brother.
He died in the war.

43:24.100 --> 43:25.251
In Afghanistan?

43:25.351 --> 43:28.171
No, he was fighting
a very stupid man called Hitler

43:28.271 --> 43:30.381
who wanted to take everybody's land.

43:30.481 --> 43:35.053
- Like Monopoly?
- Aye, just like Monopoly.

43:35.153 --> 43:36.721
Except with more screaming.

43:36.821 --> 43:39.599
Anyway, Frazer used to bring me here,

43:39.699 --> 43:41.726
- taught me how to swim.
- How did he die?

43:41.826 --> 43:43.493
Someone made a terrible mistake.

43:43.619 --> 43:46.105
A pilot thought
Frazer's platoon were Germans.

43:46.205 --> 43:47.607
Where's he buried?

43:47.707 --> 43:50.276
He isn't buried anywhere.

43:50.376 --> 43:52.362
I know about dying.

43:52.462 --> 43:53.863
Right.

43:53.963 --> 43:59.760
Cos of Bambi's mum and Babar's dad
and Simba's dad and Nigel.

44:01.012 --> 44:04.624
- Our next-door neighbour.
- I don't think this is my pebble.

44:04.724 --> 44:07.168
Oh, it definitely is.
I'd recognise it anywhere.

44:07.268 --> 44:10.187
Let's go, little beavers!
More driftwood.

44:15.401 --> 44:19.597
- Can we bury you, Granddad?
- Oh, no, that sand gets everywhere.

44:19.697 --> 44:22.100
I definitely don't want to be buried,
thank you.

44:22.200 --> 44:24.352
- Not even when you die?
- Jess!

44:24.452 --> 44:26.771
Well, that's what happens
when someone dies.

44:26.871 --> 44:29.691
You bury them
and then everyone eats cake.

44:29.791 --> 44:33.111
- That's right, isn't it, Granddad?
- Absolutely, sweetheart.

44:33.211 --> 44:35.738
I've never seen
the point of funerals myself.

44:35.838 --> 44:38.157
Nice people
all standing around in the kirk

44:38.257 --> 44:41.744
while the priest tells a pack of lies
about what a great man you were.

44:41.844 --> 44:44.580
Nah, put me out with the recycling.

44:44.680 --> 44:47.808
Purple bin, isn't it,
for plastics and dead granddads?

44:49.192 --> 44:52.405
Oh, come on, it's only a joke.

44:52.605 --> 44:55.675
No, if I had to choose
a kind of funeral,

44:55.775 --> 44:58.735
just give me a good old Viking funeral,
like my ancestors.

44:59.529 --> 45:03.391
Just stick me on a burning boat
and float me out to sea.

45:03.491 --> 45:07.979
No stupid family fights,
no stupid rows about who gets what

45:08.079 --> 45:13.192
or who does what.
Just a warrior's farewell.

45:13.292 --> 45:16.320
Can we go out
and catch some fish to cook it?

45:16.420 --> 45:19.256
Yeah, get some crabs while you're there.

45:20.007 --> 45:22.410
There are sandwiches in the pick-up,
aren't there?

45:22.510 --> 45:25.621
Yeah, but you can't hunt sandwiches,
can you?

45:25.721 --> 45:27.957
The water won't be cold,
will it, Granddad?

45:28.057 --> 45:30.042
Course not, it's only
the North Atlantic.

45:30.142 --> 45:31.794
Why on Earth would it be cold?

45:36.301 --> 45:37.967
It's freezing!

45:40.987 --> 45:42.863
You lied to us!

45:49.745 --> 45:52.064
Look, you've got to pat it down
like this.

45:52.164 --> 45:56.527
- I'm decorating it.
- That's after.

45:56.627 --> 45:58.196
Are you OK back there?

45:58.296 --> 46:02.090
Aye, I'm grand,
apart from the sand up my arse.

46:03.092 --> 46:06.245
Oh, look. Look up there,
it's the osprey.

46:06.345 --> 46:08.998
Oh, look at that.

46:09.098 --> 46:10.640
It's just a bird.

46:10.766 --> 46:12.710
17 years she's been coming back.

46:12.810 --> 46:14.504
Flown all the way from Africa.

46:14.604 --> 46:20.150
You can't really lay a egg in Africa
cos you'll get a fried egg.

46:20.276 --> 46:23.513
- How far is Africa?
- About eight million miles away.

46:23.613 --> 46:26.323
That's rubbish, isn't it, Granddad?

46:30.119 --> 46:31.813
Hey, Granddad.

46:31.913 --> 46:34.372
Perhaps he's asleep.

46:38.127 --> 46:39.544
Granddad?

46:47.002 --> 46:48.271
Granddad?

46:49.554 --> 46:51.248
Granddad! That wasn't funny!

46:52.775 --> 46:55.185
- Well, it was quite funny.
- No, it wasn't.

46:55.311 --> 46:57.604
It was funnier than monkeys!

47:02.860 --> 47:04.345
Mum and Dad lie so much.

47:04.445 --> 47:06.905
I just don't trust them any more.

47:07.615 --> 47:10.137
They make me so angry.

47:10.743 --> 47:13.578
Well, I used to feel like that
about my lot, too.

47:13.704 --> 47:14.981
Until I suddenly realised

47:15.081 --> 47:17.650
there was no point in being angry
with people I loved

47:17.750 --> 47:19.026
for being what they are.

47:19.126 --> 47:23.213
I mean, so what if your dad
is a complete and utter bloody shambles?

47:23.965 --> 47:27.535
Or your Uncle Gavin's
a bit of a tight-arse?

47:27.635 --> 47:30.929
All that social climbing!
He can't help himself

47:31.055 --> 47:36.168
any more than his wife can help
being scared of her own shadow

47:36.268 --> 47:38.436
or your mum can help being a bit mouthy.

47:39.480 --> 47:42.440
The truth is,
every human being on this planet

47:42.566 --> 47:45.235
is ridiculous in their own way.

47:46.320 --> 47:48.514
So we shouldn't judge
and we shouldn't fight,

47:48.614 --> 47:50.740
because in the end...

47:52.907 --> 47:55.229
In the end,

47:55.329 --> 47:59.416
none of it matters, none of this stuff.

48:01.252 --> 48:03.962
Lottie, this shell's got legs!

48:04.088 --> 48:06.756
It's OK, it'll be a hermit crab.

48:39.665 --> 48:43.793
Frazer? What are you doing here?

48:46.172 --> 48:50.050
Oh... I get it.

48:50.176 --> 48:52.969
Are you coming in for a swim,
you big Mary?

49:19.497 --> 49:22.040
Hey, Granddad, can we cook this crab?

49:22.166 --> 49:26.419
Or will it be unfair on the beach?
I can put it back if you want or...

49:28.839 --> 49:32.785
Oh, Granddad. Stop mucking around.

49:32.885 --> 49:35.220
I'm not falling for that again.

49:49.193 --> 49:53.404
Lottie! There's something not right
with Granddad.

49:55.282 --> 49:57.575
Oh, he's just doing
that stupid joke again.

49:57.701 --> 49:59.369
Come on, Granddad.

50:05.042 --> 50:06.084
Granddad?

50:07.753 --> 50:09.295
Granddad.

50:10.297 --> 50:12.048
Granddad?

50:14.051 --> 50:15.260
I think he might be dead.

50:26.730 --> 50:27.939
He's not breathing.

50:29.984 --> 50:32.277
I'm gonna check his pulse.

50:34.071 --> 50:35.905
They taught us this in Brownies.

50:54.842 --> 50:56.202
Granddad's got no pulse

50:56.302 --> 51:00.706
and we better get back
to tell everyone he's died.

51:00.806 --> 51:05.503
Such bad luck.
Dying just before your birthday party.

51:05.603 --> 51:08.714
Come on. The grown-ups
will know what to do.

51:08.814 --> 51:10.841
- They'll just argue.
- Hey?

51:10.941 --> 51:14.027
They'll argue and fight,
like Granddad said.

51:15.446 --> 51:17.697
And he said he didn't want that.

51:17.823 --> 51:23.479
If we leave him, he might get eaten
by badgers and seals and puffins.

51:23.579 --> 51:27.332
You go back, Lottie.
We'll stay here and guard Granddad.

51:27.458 --> 51:29.401
You're sure you'll be OK with that?

51:29.501 --> 51:31.612
Well, that's very brave
and grown-up of you.

51:31.712 --> 51:34.406
Do you think it'll be all right
if I can have the Swiss roll?

51:34.506 --> 51:36.007
I think that'll be all right.

51:36.133 --> 51:39.537
We won't eat Granddad's, just in case.

51:39.637 --> 51:42.722
I won't be long! Be sensible!

52:03.661 --> 52:08.539
I read in a newspaper article that
said when people had stopped breathing,

52:08.666 --> 52:11.485
when people's heart stopped, they die

52:11.585 --> 52:16.047
and then when they die, they felt
themselves leave their bodies

52:16.173 --> 52:20.385
and they find themselves
hovering their own bodies

52:20.511 --> 52:23.263
and looking down on people.

52:39.697 --> 52:41.906
You said it'd be a small
family gathering.

52:42.032 --> 52:44.643
- It's more like Glastonbury.
- Don't exaggerate.

52:44.743 --> 52:48.314
- Parading Dad. "Meet my dad..."
- Dad knows these people, OK?

52:48.414 --> 52:50.790
- You should give him what he wants.
- He's very ill.

52:50.916 --> 52:53.861
He doesn't know what he wants.
We have to make decisions for him.

52:53.961 --> 52:56.030
But you wouldn't know about that,
would you?

52:56.130 --> 52:58.032
- Cos you're never here.
- Oh...

52:58.132 --> 53:02.427
This is going to be a reasonable-sized
gathering to celebrate Dad's life.

53:02.553 --> 53:05.805
Where have you booked for the funeral?
Westminster Abbey? The O2 Arena?

53:05.931 --> 53:08.308
- Yeah, Leon, I'm just...
- Who's that?

53:08.434 --> 53:11.170
Oh, Leon? Geordie Leon?
My kids' new dad?

53:11.270 --> 53:14.215
- Oh! Hello, Leon!
- You pathetic child!

53:14.315 --> 53:16.675
- Mum...
- Leon is my new boss.

53:16.775 --> 53:18.735
The man I'm screwing is called Wallace.

53:20.821 --> 53:23.281
Wallace? Do the kids know?

53:23.407 --> 53:26.451
- I'll tell them when it's time.
- Does he have a dog called Gromit?

53:26.577 --> 53:28.286
Here come the stupid jokes.

54:21.048 --> 54:24.076
- She ate Granddad's Swiss roll.
- I didn't mean to!

54:24.176 --> 54:26.177
- It was a accident.
- It wasn't an accident.

54:26.303 --> 54:29.206
- It doesn't matter.
- Where are the grown-ups?

54:30.064 --> 54:31.959
Fighting. Mickey was right.

54:32.059 --> 54:34.628
They can't be trusted
to do what Granddad wanted.

54:34.728 --> 54:36.547
So we're gonna do it.

54:36.647 --> 54:38.924
We're gonna give him
the funeral he wanted.

54:39.024 --> 54:40.900
- A Viking one?
- Yeah.

54:41.026 --> 54:43.528
- Cool.
- Where will we find a Viking boat?

54:45.155 --> 54:46.864
There's one in York.

54:46.990 --> 54:49.601
But I'm not sure
the museum will lend it to us

54:49.701 --> 54:51.812
if we tell them we're gonna burn it.

54:51.912 --> 54:54.606
Right, now listen,
we've all got to work together.

54:54.706 --> 54:57.583
- This is our present to Granddad.
- Shotgun the matches!

55:03.674 --> 55:04.715
Margaret!

55:13.058 --> 55:15.518
That's drop-off point B. Turn around.

55:20.607 --> 55:23.568
So it won't be
a proper Viking longboat then?

55:23.694 --> 55:25.804
- No, it'll be a raft.
- How are we gonna move it?

55:25.904 --> 55:27.905
We'll put it in Granddad's car.

55:28.031 --> 55:30.642
- But we can't drive.
- Yes, we can.

55:34.872 --> 55:38.124
Mickey, you push the pedal
and I'll do the wheel.

55:41.837 --> 55:43.781
I think we need to do
something with this.

55:43.881 --> 55:46.116
Which one should I do?
One, two, three or R?

55:46.216 --> 55:49.495
- One.
- I think we should go with R

55:49.595 --> 55:51.689
because we want the car to go...

55:52.973 --> 55:57.503
I'm gonna do one. Do you think
we'll get into trouble for this?

55:57.603 --> 55:59.671
The grown-ups might be annoyed at first,

55:59.771 --> 56:02.216
but once we tell them
this is what Granddad wanted...

56:03.281 --> 56:05.101
Do the pedal again!

56:09.740 --> 56:12.450
The car sounds a bit annoyed!

56:12.576 --> 56:15.453
- How's that?
- Do I do left or right?

56:15.579 --> 56:17.997
Right. No!

56:18.999 --> 56:21.893
I'm not wearing a seat belt!

56:24.588 --> 56:26.631
A bit more. Turn a bit harder.

56:27.841 --> 56:30.009
Is that better?

56:34.681 --> 56:37.099
How are we going to get that
in the back?

56:38.519 --> 56:41.171
I've used every knot I know back there.

56:41.271 --> 56:43.314
Granddad said the tide's coming in,

56:43.440 --> 56:45.483
so if we leave the car
at the edge of the sea...

56:45.609 --> 56:48.027
Whoa! This is bumpy!

56:49.154 --> 56:51.781
Jess, shout when it's at the edge.

56:53.492 --> 56:55.117
Edge!

56:58.664 --> 57:00.357
- Oh, for God's sake!
- Yay! We did it!

57:00.457 --> 57:05.419
- Do you think we should lock it?
- Yes, we don't want it getting stolen.

57:07.464 --> 57:09.575
To be a proper Viking funeral,

57:09.675 --> 57:13.511
it's crucial that you need to take
his favourite things to heaven.

57:13.637 --> 57:14.887
I thought of that.

57:18.517 --> 57:21.086
Oh, his Scotland shirt. Brilliant!

57:25.232 --> 57:28.218
- Granddad! He's alive!
- Granddad!

57:28.318 --> 57:30.570
Wake up! Come on, Granddad!

57:30.696 --> 57:32.973
Wake up, Granddad!

57:33.073 --> 57:35.241
Granddad.

57:36.660 --> 57:37.910
Come on.

57:43.000 --> 57:44.208
He's cold.

57:47.379 --> 57:50.172
I think people do farts
after they're dead.

57:50.716 --> 57:56.330
I saw it on this programme
called The Real Silent Witness.

57:56.430 --> 58:00.792
- This woman said so.
- Are you sure?

58:00.892 --> 58:06.355
She was wearing a white coat.
She said dead people are full of gas.

58:09.359 --> 58:11.402
I'm scared.

58:13.030 --> 58:16.240
It's OK. It's only Granddad.

58:18.952 --> 58:23.190
He sort of died in battle
cos he was fighting cancer,

58:23.290 --> 58:25.291
so we'll give him a warrior's funeral.

59:02.079 --> 59:04.856
I didn't think this would work.

59:04.956 --> 59:08.694
Well, it works at Stonehenge.
Druids moved huge rocks.

59:08.794 --> 59:12.922
Not granddads. So well done, my brain.

59:13.840 --> 59:16.076
I so can't wait to go back to school

59:16.176 --> 59:20.080
when we get to write about
what I did on our half term.

59:20.180 --> 59:23.500
But I bet Shona's done
something more interesting

59:23.600 --> 59:24.809
like she always has.

59:48.959 --> 59:50.626
Goodbye.

59:51.545 --> 59:52.962
You were nice.

59:56.842 --> 59:59.051
Please accept my pebble.

01:00:18.697 --> 01:00:22.825
We are gathered here,
to remember Gordie McLeod.

01:00:23.994 --> 01:00:25.745
I'm sorry you died, Granddad.

01:00:28.665 --> 01:00:31.083
I liked having someone to talk to.

01:00:34.588 --> 01:00:37.339
Have a good Valhalla.

01:00:38.091 --> 01:00:39.091
Amen.

01:01:13.210 --> 01:01:15.628
He'd be so proud of us.

01:01:47.536 --> 01:01:49.855
We can do folk rock, we can do country,

01:01:49.955 --> 01:01:52.832
we can do country folk rock,
indie folk rock.

01:01:54.501 --> 01:01:57.320
Oh, my goodness. Where have you been?

01:01:57.420 --> 01:01:59.114
- We need...
- I told Granddad seven.

01:01:59.214 --> 01:02:00.991
- But...
- Oh, you're all mucky.

01:02:01.091 --> 01:02:03.201
- Come on, bath time.
- But we need...

01:02:03.301 --> 01:02:05.495
Did I mention bluegrass?
We can do bluegrass.

01:02:05.595 --> 01:02:07.622
But not so fast
since Billy had his stroke.

01:02:07.722 --> 01:02:09.583
Chop chop, the party's starting soon.

01:02:09.683 --> 01:02:12.893
- I've laid your clothes out.
- Granddad died.

01:02:14.354 --> 01:02:15.756
- What?
- Granddad died.

01:02:15.856 --> 01:02:17.924
Oh, crikey, guys,
what time do you call this?

01:02:18.024 --> 01:02:20.969
Doug. They're saying Gordie's died.

01:02:21.069 --> 01:02:25.406
Hallelujah. At last. So what have
you done with your granddad?

01:02:25.532 --> 01:02:30.312
- Well...
- He died. On the beach.

01:02:30.412 --> 01:02:32.272
OK, I'm on it.

01:02:32.372 --> 01:02:34.733
- I shouldn't have let him...
- It's all right, love.

01:02:34.833 --> 01:02:36.860
Yes, ambulance, quickly, please to...

01:02:36.960 --> 01:02:39.545
- Lottie, where exactly is Granddad now?
- Out at sea.

01:02:42.048 --> 01:02:44.758
- Out at sea?
- And on fire.

01:02:47.554 --> 01:02:51.833
He wanted a Viking funeral,
so we built a raft, put the body on it,

01:02:51.933 --> 01:02:54.643
set it on fire
and floated him out to sea.

01:02:56.146 --> 01:02:57.631
Can you hold on a sec?

01:02:57.731 --> 01:03:01.301
Lottie. Stop being silly,
just tell us, where is Granddad?

01:03:01.401 --> 01:03:04.137
Yeah. This is a wind-up.

01:03:04.237 --> 01:03:05.806
He's put you up to this, hasn't he?

01:03:05.906 --> 01:03:08.225
This is one of Granddad's
stupid jokes, isn't it?

01:03:08.325 --> 01:03:10.393
Well, he did do it as a joke
to pretend to die,

01:03:10.493 --> 01:03:13.162
but this time, it's not a joke.

01:03:13.997 --> 01:03:17.067
- Hello?
- Yes, yeah.

01:03:17.167 --> 01:03:21.196
We're just getting the details if you
could just show us a bit of patience.

01:03:21.296 --> 01:03:23.990
I know that you're going to tell me
exactly what happened.

01:03:24.090 --> 01:03:26.743
Well, I found lots of wood and...

01:03:26.843 --> 01:03:29.246
- Er...
- ...and I found lots of crabs.

01:03:29.346 --> 01:03:30.914
- Right...
- I lost my rock.

01:03:31.014 --> 01:03:34.501
- At the end of the day, I found it.
- But what happened to Granddad?

01:03:34.601 --> 01:03:39.339
There was a lady with a girlfriend
that lived with lots of pigs.

01:03:39.439 --> 01:03:41.216
- After the lady.
- She sweared a lot.

01:03:41.316 --> 01:03:43.885
- Back to Granddad.
- It's vital you tell the truth.

01:03:43.985 --> 01:03:45.929
- We do tell the truth.
- Keep it down.

01:03:46.029 --> 01:03:49.099
Nothing to do with the fish
or the crab or your stone, sweetie.

01:03:49.199 --> 01:03:50.183
Where is Granddad?

01:03:50.283 --> 01:03:52.352
If you listen, I'll tell you the story.

01:03:52.452 --> 01:03:55.230
- I know, darling, but faster.
- So will you listen?

01:03:56.456 --> 01:03:58.525
- Grandpa farted.
- Oh.

01:03:58.625 --> 01:04:02.529
Yes, we do still need an ambulance.
And the police.

01:04:02.629 --> 01:04:05.506
And possibly the coastguard.

01:04:05.632 --> 01:04:09.077
No, we don't need the fire brigade,
and I don't appreciate your tone.

01:04:09.177 --> 01:04:11.413
Well, he is on fire.

01:04:11.513 --> 01:04:14.082
- Quickly now.
- I found some fishes.

01:04:14.182 --> 01:04:17.544
- Yep, after...
- Lottie knocked over some signs.

01:04:17.644 --> 01:04:18.753
What happened next?

01:04:18.853 --> 01:04:22.465
Yes, it is an emergency, we just
don't know what sort of emergency.

01:04:22.565 --> 01:04:23.758
And then?

01:04:23.858 --> 01:04:26.928
I stopped the crows from eating Grandpa.

01:04:27.028 --> 01:04:28.028
OK.

01:04:28.154 --> 01:04:30.891
I'm perfectly aware
that it is a criminal offence

01:04:30.991 --> 01:04:32.533
to make prank calls, but...

01:04:33.785 --> 01:04:36.313
She's hung up! 999 has hung up!

01:04:36.413 --> 01:04:38.565
Do we still have to have a bath?

01:04:38.665 --> 01:04:41.610
- No.
- Yay!

01:04:41.710 --> 01:04:45.447
Car keys! Where the bloody hell
are the car keys?

01:04:45.547 --> 01:04:47.574
We'll take ours.

01:04:47.674 --> 01:04:50.285
Okey-dokey.

01:04:50.385 --> 01:04:53.496
Now then, I have some very important
cake-tasting needs done.

01:04:53.596 --> 01:04:56.306
Do I have any volunteers
to help me with that?

01:05:48.234 --> 01:05:49.860
You stupid...!

01:05:55.658 --> 01:05:58.895
- You stupid...
- Gavin, Gavin, Gavin, Gavin, Gavin.

01:05:58.995 --> 01:06:02.023
Come on. No, no! Whoa, whoa! All right!

01:06:02.623 --> 01:06:04.693
All right, all right, it's all right.

01:06:04.793 --> 01:06:07.503
It's OK. It's all right.

01:06:20.802 --> 01:06:23.016
Two, three, four.

01:06:37.450 --> 01:06:41.161
I don't believe this.
This is a bloody nightmare.

01:06:41.287 --> 01:06:43.732
Sir Donald, glad you could make it.

01:06:43.832 --> 01:06:45.316
A bloody total nightmare.

01:06:45.416 --> 01:06:48.862
Hughie. Good to see you.

01:06:48.962 --> 01:06:51.197
A bloody total nightmare.

01:06:51.297 --> 01:06:54.200
- Gavin, language. The children.
- Right, yeah.

01:06:54.300 --> 01:06:57.203
They can't hear "bloody"
but they can set fire to my father.

01:06:57.303 --> 01:06:59.581
We didn't hurt him. He was dead.

01:06:59.681 --> 01:07:02.459
- Let's hope so.
- For Christ's sake. They were...

01:07:02.559 --> 01:07:05.628
Someone best break it
to the ones who've arrived.

01:07:05.728 --> 01:07:08.840
- We just did what Granddad wanted.
- He didn't want this.

01:07:08.940 --> 01:07:12.135
He wanted to be cremated. Don't say it.
I'm looking for someone to punch

01:07:12.235 --> 01:07:15.654
- and your children are too small!
- Enough!

01:07:21.911 --> 01:07:23.245
Odin.

01:07:26.374 --> 01:07:29.611
Excuse me. Excuse me!

01:07:34.716 --> 01:07:35.909
Sorry, no photos.

01:07:36.009 --> 01:07:38.028
Thank you all so much for coming.

01:07:38.128 --> 01:07:42.139
Gordie would be pleased to see so many
of his friends gathered together.

01:07:43.892 --> 01:07:46.586
Except sadly,

01:07:46.686 --> 01:07:49.479
Gordie can't be pleased because...

01:07:51.566 --> 01:07:54.886
he passed away today.

01:07:56.696 --> 01:07:58.681
We think.

01:07:58.781 --> 01:08:03.285
W-W-We're fairly certain he has.

01:08:06.623 --> 01:08:09.859
Anyway,
I know you won't feel like dancing,

01:08:09.959 --> 01:08:14.280
but do please have a drink
and make yourselves at home.

01:08:15.101 --> 01:08:17.158
Jimmy Cazerotto?

01:08:17.258 --> 01:08:18.283
Margaret!

01:08:18.384 --> 01:08:23.138
- We thought you were in New Zealand.
- Where is the old bastard?

01:08:25.225 --> 01:08:28.435
- Jimmy, I'm Abi.
- What?

01:08:56.256 --> 01:08:58.992
Where's Kenneth?
He's supposed to be...

01:08:59.091 --> 01:09:03.496
- Aha! You took your time, Murdo.
- It's Andy Mackay's stag night.

01:09:03.595 --> 01:09:05.680
A dwarf got thrown through a window.

01:09:07.225 --> 01:09:10.310
- This is Agnes Chisholm.
- From the Child Welfare Unit.

01:09:10.435 --> 01:09:12.813
I'll require a room for interviews.

01:09:12.939 --> 01:09:15.841
I found this child outside.
Unaccompanied.

01:09:15.942 --> 01:09:18.359
Yeah, that's my son.

01:09:21.029 --> 01:09:22.055
Thank you.

01:09:22.156 --> 01:09:25.059
Why have they called the police?
We've done nothing wrong.

01:09:25.158 --> 01:09:27.103
Please do exactly as I ask.

01:09:27.203 --> 01:09:29.955
There is a procedure
for this kind of situation.

01:09:30.957 --> 01:09:33.526
- There is?
- Oh, yes.

01:09:33.626 --> 01:09:35.361
So he's at peace.

01:09:35.461 --> 01:09:36.962
At... At peace.

01:09:37.462 --> 01:09:40.465
Can I see him one last time?

01:09:41.676 --> 01:09:44.176
I've come all the way
from New Zealand, you know.

01:09:45.971 --> 01:09:48.917
I'm afraid that's not possible, Jimmy.

01:09:49.517 --> 01:09:52.769
It's not... not... possible.

01:09:57.817 --> 01:10:02.404
Sir Donald.
Very sorry about this, Sir Donald.

01:10:03.614 --> 01:10:05.016
It's funny, this morning...

01:10:05.116 --> 01:10:11.439
And we think...
we think that's what happened

01:10:11.539 --> 01:10:13.775
but obviously, that's...

01:10:13.875 --> 01:10:15.375
That's what?

01:10:17.170 --> 01:10:20.172
Confidential.

01:10:20.923 --> 01:10:25.411
That the kids burnt his body
and floated him out to sea?

01:10:35.021 --> 01:10:38.023
Yes, well, the kids...

01:10:39.650 --> 01:10:40.901
They're from London.

01:10:42.862 --> 01:10:44.806
So, thank you for that, Jess.

01:10:44.906 --> 01:10:46.224
And if it's OK with you,

01:10:46.324 --> 01:10:50.228
I'll just keep this lovely drawing
I asked you to do of the three of you

01:10:50.328 --> 01:10:53.481
setting fire to your grandpa.

01:10:53.581 --> 01:10:57.235
- Do you want to put it on your fridge?
- No. That's not...

01:10:57.335 --> 01:11:01.364
There wasn't exactly
a unicorn on the beach

01:11:01.464 --> 01:11:03.074
but I just got bored.

01:11:03.174 --> 01:11:05.326
Perhaps we could hang on to the picture.

01:11:05.426 --> 01:11:08.538
It will be returned to you
when the investigation's completed.

01:11:08.638 --> 01:11:09.622
Can I go now?

01:11:09.722 --> 01:11:13.266
- I was halfway through a Cheese String.
- OK.

01:11:18.398 --> 01:11:23.068
So she holds her breath
quite often, does she?

01:11:41.254 --> 01:11:47.076
So, Mickey, the idea
for the special funeral,

01:11:47.176 --> 01:11:49.386
- who did that come from?
- Odin.

01:11:52.098 --> 01:11:53.082
Odin?

01:11:53.182 --> 01:11:57.003
He walks the Earth with one eye
and a big hat and an eight-legged horse

01:11:57.103 --> 01:11:59.839
disguised as a traveller
to see if people's nice to him

01:11:59.939 --> 01:12:01.549
and he's here now.

01:12:01.649 --> 01:12:06.846
So, Odin, the Norse god,
is currently here

01:12:06.946 --> 01:12:10.031
with an eight-legged horse?

01:12:19.375 --> 01:12:22.502
Ach, sod it, lads. Let's call it a day.

01:12:32.763 --> 01:12:34.415
Kenneth! Kenneth!

01:12:34.515 --> 01:12:36.391
Where the hell is he?

01:12:40.313 --> 01:12:43.257
Is this an effective use
of police resources?

01:12:43.357 --> 01:12:46.302
Shouldn't you be out
looking for evidence of my father?

01:12:46.402 --> 01:12:48.096
We haven't got a submarine.

01:12:50.388 --> 01:12:51.865
Jokes is it now?

01:12:52.575 --> 01:12:55.035
Make it bigger! Bigger!

01:12:55.161 --> 01:12:57.146
Don't stress, I'm trying.

01:12:57.246 --> 01:12:58.731
This isn't cats.

01:12:58.831 --> 01:13:00.817
It's something Kenneth's been watching.

01:13:00.917 --> 01:13:04.544
Don't just press buttons at random.

01:13:12.470 --> 01:13:14.304
Is that the YouTube thing?

01:13:15.431 --> 01:13:18.683
I've thought of a joke.
A very funny joke. Yeah.

01:13:20.853 --> 01:13:22.922
I make an official complaint

01:13:23.022 --> 01:13:26.592
to your Chief Superintendent
who happens to be a friend of mine

01:13:26.692 --> 01:13:32.697
who happens to be in my house right now
as a guest, so...

01:13:36.577 --> 01:13:40.455
So, Lottie,
when your granddad passed away...

01:13:42.500 --> 01:13:45.252
Ten to four. Approximately.

01:13:46.754 --> 01:13:48.421
That's a pretty wee notebook.

01:13:49.298 --> 01:13:52.201
What sort of things do you put in that?

01:13:52.301 --> 01:13:55.220
Thoughts, facts, information.

01:13:56.347 --> 01:13:57.415
Lies that I get told.

01:13:57.515 --> 01:13:59.808
Could I possibly have a look at that?

01:14:05.565 --> 01:14:07.884
Do you think
I could hang on to this for a bit?

01:14:07.984 --> 01:14:11.179
Is that really necessary?
Why would...

01:14:11.279 --> 01:14:12.889
Why would you need to hang on to it?

01:14:12.989 --> 01:14:16.017
You're not thinking of...
removing us anywhere, are you?

01:14:16.117 --> 01:14:19.896
Don't be silly, darling. This lady's
not here to do that. Are you?

01:14:19.996 --> 01:14:22.414
At this stage,
I'm just making an assessment.

01:14:29.338 --> 01:14:31.324
What is that?

01:14:31.424 --> 01:14:33.758
God, what is she doing?

01:14:40.349 --> 01:14:42.418
I take it you hadn't seen this,
Mr McLeod.

01:14:42.518 --> 01:14:44.003
No charges were brought.

01:14:44.103 --> 01:14:47.924
No, the staff at the mini mart
were very good about it.

01:14:48.024 --> 01:14:51.761
Everyone... you know,
understood that your wife was,

01:14:51.861 --> 01:14:56.599
you know, adversely affected
by her medication.

01:14:56.699 --> 01:15:01.161
- Medication?
- Yeah, the anti-depressants.

01:15:01.912 --> 01:15:03.872
For the depression.

01:15:07.543 --> 01:15:09.419
It's not your night, is it?

01:15:12.173 --> 01:15:14.341
Who fancies a dram?

01:15:15.635 --> 01:15:16.994
I'm taking orders.

01:15:17.094 --> 01:15:20.805
I've got Glengoyne or Glenmorangie.

01:15:24.143 --> 01:15:25.461
It's finished. Play it again.

01:15:25.561 --> 01:15:28.229
Oh, for Christ's sake! Kids!

01:15:35.946 --> 01:15:37.098
Everything all right?

01:15:37.198 --> 01:15:41.117
Please don't go anywhere
without notifying me, will you?

01:15:52.880 --> 01:15:54.589
Has something happened?

01:16:18.447 --> 01:16:21.517
Why is the knives and forks so loud?

01:16:24.620 --> 01:16:28.357
- Have you ever read Lottie's notebook?
- No. Have you?

01:16:28.457 --> 01:16:30.276
No.

01:16:30.376 --> 01:16:32.653
Well, not... not much.

01:16:32.753 --> 01:16:34.572
She writes down everything.

01:16:34.672 --> 01:16:36.548
Hey, sleep OK, sweetheart?

01:16:39.427 --> 01:16:42.830
And now intervention woman's got it.

01:16:42.930 --> 01:16:45.306
- Intervention?
- That's the word she keeps using.

01:16:48.602 --> 01:16:50.713
I think maybe we should get a lawyer.

01:16:50.813 --> 01:16:53.940
Another lawyer? They've been great
at calming things down.

01:16:54.066 --> 01:16:56.761
The important thing is
not to antagonise her.

01:16:56.861 --> 01:16:58.471
- We just need to...
- Good morning.

01:16:58.571 --> 01:17:00.348
Morning.

01:17:00.448 --> 01:17:02.683
Jesus, no, no!

01:17:04.118 --> 01:17:06.077
For God's sake, Kenneth!

01:17:09.582 --> 01:17:11.359
How did they find us so fast?

01:17:11.459 --> 01:17:14.127
That'll be that bloody Donny Mackay.

01:17:15.796 --> 01:17:18.339
He'll do anything
to fill his bloody guest house.

01:17:20.217 --> 01:17:21.827
Oh, what's the point?

01:17:21.927 --> 01:17:24.330
No one gets to keep
any secrets any more.

01:17:24.430 --> 01:17:26.082
Well, you can say that again.

01:17:26.182 --> 01:17:29.642
No one gets to keep
any secrets any more.

01:17:31.425 --> 01:17:33.089
Bloody vultures!

01:17:33.189 --> 01:17:36.050
Why can't Scotland have
a law of trespass like a real country?

01:17:36.150 --> 01:17:39.152
Oh, Lord. It's Little Miss Sunshine.

01:17:40.196 --> 01:17:42.431
- Oh, Christ. Just be...
- Be what?

01:17:42.531 --> 01:17:44.657
Just be... You know...

01:17:49.663 --> 01:17:52.441
I came through the back lane
to evade all the media.

01:17:52.541 --> 01:17:54.793
Well, thank you.

01:17:56.504 --> 01:17:57.504
May I come in?

01:17:57.630 --> 01:17:58.739
- Of course.
- Why?

01:17:58.839 --> 01:18:00.658
- I'm sorry?
- Why do you want to come in?

01:18:00.758 --> 01:18:03.327
- Abi, she's just...
- I need more information.

01:18:03.427 --> 01:18:04.620
What sort of information?

01:18:04.720 --> 01:18:08.416
Information to help assess
which of the range of outcomes...

01:18:08.516 --> 01:18:12.253
- Outcomes? What outcomes?
- Outcomes, Abi.

01:18:12.353 --> 01:18:14.422
A range of outcomes
from intervention to...

01:18:14.522 --> 01:18:16.523
There! She said it.

01:18:16.649 --> 01:18:19.025
I could involve the police
in this conversation.

01:18:19.151 --> 01:18:20.928
You can come in when I get an assurance

01:18:21.028 --> 01:18:23.639
that there is no possibility
of you taking away my kids.

01:18:23.739 --> 01:18:26.559
- Abi.
- As I was in the process of saying...

01:18:26.659 --> 01:18:29.145
- I'll take that as a no, then.
- Abi!

01:18:29.245 --> 01:18:31.663
Jesus. Look at this.

01:18:32.581 --> 01:18:34.275
Look at it. Look.

01:18:34.375 --> 01:18:36.902
We're front page of
the Daily Mail as well.

01:18:37.002 --> 01:18:38.946
- Thank you, Kenneth.
- And the Express.

01:18:39.046 --> 01:18:41.866
- Kenneth, that's enough.
- "Feral Children Sacrifice..."

01:18:41.966 --> 01:18:45.161
Kenneth! We can do without
the bloody rolling bulletin!

01:18:45.261 --> 01:18:47.246
- Thank you.
- We need to deal with this.

01:18:47.346 --> 01:18:50.166
- It's not helpful.
- I'm trying to be informative.

01:18:50.266 --> 01:18:51.357
Kenneth!

01:18:59.066 --> 01:19:02.428
Look, Gavin,
about the supermarket episode...

01:19:02.528 --> 01:19:05.280
There's nothing... helpful
to be said about that.

01:19:10.452 --> 01:19:12.855
- I was wondering...
- I'd like my notebook back.

01:19:12.955 --> 01:19:17.375
I'm sorry, Lottie, I'm only permitted to
talk to you in an interview situation.

01:19:18.544 --> 01:19:22.589
Actually, could I just nip in
and use your phone for a moment?

01:19:29.930 --> 01:19:31.707
But the Prime Minister has tweeted

01:19:31.807 --> 01:19:34.851
that the incident is the symptom
of a broken society.

01:19:38.230 --> 01:19:41.258
Don't worry, Dad, I told you,
Odin will sort all this out.

01:19:41.358 --> 01:19:42.927
Mickey, you didn't see Odin.

01:19:43.027 --> 01:19:45.012
Miss Pringle said that she saw Jesus

01:19:45.112 --> 01:19:47.431
and if she can see Jesus,
I can see Odin.

01:19:47.531 --> 01:19:49.558
You didn't see Odin!
There is no Odin.

01:19:49.658 --> 01:19:51.367
This is the real world.

01:19:52.769 --> 01:19:55.401
We're on television!

01:19:56.957 --> 01:19:59.568
The three children from this family

01:19:59.668 --> 01:20:01.737
who cannot be named for legal reasons...

01:20:01.837 --> 01:20:04.631
- Oh!
- ...are inside the house.

01:20:04.757 --> 01:20:07.535
- The police have announced...
- We can only confirm

01:20:07.635 --> 01:20:10.329
that the body of a man
in his mid-seventies

01:20:10.429 --> 01:20:15.793
was... destroyed and floated out to sea

01:20:15.893 --> 01:20:17.461
possibly with some valuables.

01:20:19.605 --> 01:20:20.673
Hi, there.

01:20:20.773 --> 01:20:23.467
I forgot to put
the brooch in my drawing.

01:20:23.567 --> 01:20:25.094
- Yes, it was.
- Brooch?

01:20:25.194 --> 01:20:28.055
Granddad's Viking brooch.
We put it on the raft.

01:20:28.155 --> 01:20:31.032
All Vikings went to Valhalla
with their treasure.

01:20:31.784 --> 01:20:33.660
You morons!

01:20:33.786 --> 01:20:35.688
Well, that's just rude.

01:20:35.788 --> 01:20:37.356
You, stupid, stupid little...

01:20:37.456 --> 01:20:40.526
- Whoa, whoa, enough!
- They've destroyed a family heirloom.

01:20:40.626 --> 01:20:43.169
- Dad found it.
- It's worth £15,000.

01:20:43.295 --> 01:20:46.115
- 15,000?
- I had it valued.

01:20:46.215 --> 01:20:49.577
- Oh, I get it.
- What's that supposed to mean?

01:20:49.677 --> 01:20:51.120
- Thinking ahead?
- Doug...

01:20:51.220 --> 01:20:54.832
Thought we'd keep that secret
till after we divided up Dad's things?

01:20:54.932 --> 01:20:58.460
I was going to announce it
as a surprise for his birthday.

01:20:58.560 --> 01:21:01.547
Please! I'm glad
he's not here to listen to this.

01:21:01.647 --> 01:21:04.383
He probably would be here
if it wasn't for your mental kids!

01:21:04.483 --> 01:21:06.468
- It is not the kids' fault!
- That's right!

01:21:06.568 --> 01:21:07.928
- It's his.
- What?

01:21:08.028 --> 01:21:09.597
Lottie tried to get us to listen

01:21:09.697 --> 01:21:12.699
and you were too busy having
an argument with your stupid brother.

01:21:12.825 --> 01:21:16.020
- This isn't getting us anywhere.
- Oh, just go chuck a pumpkin!

01:21:16.120 --> 01:21:18.606
- That's enough.
- It's not enough.

01:21:18.706 --> 01:21:21.358
- Nothing's enough for you, is it?
- Stop!

01:21:21.458 --> 01:21:25.962
Stop it now! This is exactly
what Granddad said would happen.

01:21:27.006 --> 01:21:30.993
He wanted a Viking funeral so it would
give you all less to fight about.

01:21:31.093 --> 01:21:34.538
He said no one should fight,
because at the end of the day,

01:21:34.638 --> 01:21:37.724
it doesn't matter
if Uncle Gavin's a tight-arse

01:21:37.850 --> 01:21:42.755
and Dad's a shambles
and Mum's a bit mouthy

01:21:42.855 --> 01:21:48.552
and Auntie Margaret's...
something or other.

01:21:48.652 --> 01:21:51.362
He said you mustn't mind about that
in the people you love.

01:21:52.406 --> 01:21:57.452
Because... we're all... ridiculous,
and none of this matters.

01:21:58.412 --> 01:22:02.399
Well, I'm sorry, Gavin.
I shouldn't have said all that stuff.

01:22:02.499 --> 01:22:07.863
No, no, it was me.
I didn't... I was being a...

01:22:07.963 --> 01:22:10.214
Listen, kids. I'm really sorry, but...

01:22:11.717 --> 01:22:14.703
Sometimes when adults
get a little bit upset,

01:22:14.803 --> 01:22:15.871
they just become a...

01:22:15.971 --> 01:22:18.165
Where's Mickey?

01:22:18.265 --> 01:22:20.167
He's on there.

01:22:20.267 --> 01:22:23.504
I'm fed up of being stuck inside.
I've come out to explain.

01:22:23.604 --> 01:22:26.548
- Jesus!
- Tell them "no comment"!

01:22:26.648 --> 01:22:28.217
Cos this is the real world.

01:22:28.317 --> 01:22:31.345
Granddad stopped breathing
and then what happened...

01:22:31.445 --> 01:22:33.639
That's enough, thank you.

01:22:33.739 --> 01:22:36.809
- You best go back inside.
- I was trying to explain everything.

01:22:36.909 --> 01:22:39.937
- Yeah, I know but...
- As it's all our fault,

01:22:40.037 --> 01:22:42.747
I thought it might stop the shouting.

01:22:44.291 --> 01:22:46.667
No, it's not all your fault.
Nothing's your fault.

01:22:49.963 --> 01:22:51.756
You head inside, go on.

01:22:54.343 --> 01:22:56.912
- We have no comment to make.
- Good. Straight bat.

01:22:57.012 --> 01:22:58.414
You were on TV!

01:22:58.514 --> 01:23:00.541
We have no comment to make
at this juncture.

01:23:00.641 --> 01:23:03.752
Mr McLeod, can you confirm reports?

01:23:03.852 --> 01:23:07.548
Except to say... you should
all be ashamed of yourselves.

01:23:07.648 --> 01:23:09.633
- What's he doing?
- You're a disgrace!

01:23:09.733 --> 01:23:10.817
Don't provoke them!

01:23:10.943 --> 01:23:13.762
You have guidelines.
My son is six years old!

01:23:13.862 --> 01:23:16.348
Then why's he wandering about alone?

01:23:16.448 --> 01:23:19.143
He was... We have no further comment.

01:23:19.243 --> 01:23:22.563
Why were young children left
in the care of an elderly, sick man?

01:23:22.663 --> 01:23:24.773
- Mr McLeod, over here!
- Well...

01:23:24.873 --> 01:23:28.193
We... we did deliberate over that.

01:23:28.293 --> 01:23:29.335
Walk away, man.

01:23:31.463 --> 01:23:33.631
Is your divorce affecting your children?

01:23:35.551 --> 01:23:38.010
Your divorce, caused by your affair.

01:23:39.638 --> 01:23:41.457
Do you take responsibility

01:23:41.557 --> 01:23:45.101
for the actions of your children?
Do you feel you've failed as a father?

01:23:48.230 --> 01:23:49.548
Sorry, what?

01:23:49.648 --> 01:23:51.983
Do you feel you've failed as a father?

01:23:52.818 --> 01:23:54.402
Well, I'm not sure that...

01:23:55.529 --> 01:23:57.806
I mean...

01:23:57.906 --> 01:24:01.268
- It's true that I've certainly...
- Mrs McLeod.

01:24:01.368 --> 01:24:04.021
My husband is a good and loving father.

01:24:04.121 --> 01:24:06.023
We have no further comment.

01:24:06.123 --> 01:24:08.609
Would you describe your marriage
as dysfunctional?

01:24:08.709 --> 01:24:12.780
Oh, the magic word, "dysfunctional".
Yeah! Yep, fine.

01:24:12.880 --> 01:24:15.240
- Fine, we're dysfunctional.
- She's doing it now.

01:24:15.340 --> 01:24:17.034
If you mean by "dysfunctional"

01:24:17.134 --> 01:24:20.329
that we're two average people
who have made a few mistakes,

01:24:20.429 --> 01:24:22.706
and are trying very hard
to muddle through

01:24:22.806 --> 01:24:24.291
while trying our utmost

01:24:24.391 --> 01:24:29.296
to protect and nurture
our three... fantastic children,

01:24:29.396 --> 01:24:31.131
Jess, Mickey and Lottie...

01:24:31.231 --> 01:24:33.634
- Yes! Name check.
- Yay!

01:24:33.734 --> 01:24:36.678
Yes, we are dysfunctional.
Thank you.

01:24:40.365 --> 01:24:42.101
Bravo, Abi.

01:24:42.201 --> 01:24:46.329
Well done, Abi.
You certainly put them in their place.

01:24:58.759 --> 01:25:00.301
Has something else happened?

01:25:12.856 --> 01:25:17.010
I've learnt my lesson. Next time I'm
with someone who's died on the beach,

01:25:17.110 --> 01:25:20.571
I'll tell an adult
and I won't set fire to them.

01:25:21.323 --> 01:25:22.683
Very sensible.

01:25:22.783 --> 01:25:24.492
Cheers.

01:25:26.578 --> 01:25:29.956
- It's nice that Mickey wants to be...
- I said no to the Newcastle job.

01:25:31.833 --> 01:25:34.752
- Did you?
- Yeah.

01:25:36.171 --> 01:25:37.171
Thanks.

01:25:40.968 --> 01:25:43.287
I've decided I don't need a solicitor.

01:25:43.387 --> 01:25:45.914
I know. My solicitor told me.

01:25:46.014 --> 01:25:47.875
- Already?
- Yep.

01:25:47.975 --> 01:25:50.210
She said it gave me a huge advantage.

01:25:50.310 --> 01:25:53.187
She used the phrase "easy meat".

01:25:54.356 --> 01:25:55.690
I'm gonna get rid of her.

01:25:58.026 --> 01:26:00.486
Let's do this humanely.

01:26:03.198 --> 01:26:05.726
OK, everybody.

01:26:05.826 --> 01:26:08.270
Everyone, if you could
just gather round.

01:26:08.370 --> 01:26:11.732
Sorry the midges are out
in their hordes.

01:26:11.832 --> 01:26:14.067
- This is...
- Over here, guys.

01:26:14.167 --> 01:26:18.113
Lottie? I'm not sure
there's any actual, real evidence

01:26:18.213 --> 01:26:20.824
that the Vikings actually
buried their dead

01:26:20.924 --> 01:26:25.219
by burning them
and floating them out to sea.

01:26:26.430 --> 01:26:28.165
Mickey?

01:26:28.265 --> 01:26:31.976
Never, ever say that out loud again.

01:26:32.519 --> 01:26:35.813
Over here. Thanks.

01:26:37.149 --> 01:26:39.525
My brother Doug
is going to say a few words.

01:26:51.788 --> 01:26:53.039
Thanks for coming.

01:26:54.485 --> 01:26:55.868
Well done for shaking off the reporters.

01:26:58.211 --> 01:27:01.922
The press have portrayed
my father's death as a disgrace.

01:27:03.300 --> 01:27:06.093
But what better way to die
could he have had...

01:27:09.765 --> 01:27:11.515
than on his favourite beach...

01:27:16.938 --> 01:27:19.607
watching the grandchildren
that he loved play...

01:27:22.361 --> 01:27:23.986
play...

01:27:28.200 --> 01:27:30.910
I don't know what Dad
would have made of all this.

01:27:32.871 --> 01:27:37.375
Actually, I do.
He'd have laughed himself stupid.

01:27:39.002 --> 01:27:42.698
He'd have laughed at everyone turning up
for his party except for him.

01:27:42.798 --> 01:27:44.616
He'd have laughed at the authorities

01:27:44.716 --> 01:27:47.244
trying to find
the relevant form to fill in...

01:27:48.762 --> 01:27:53.500
He'd certainly have laughed at
Margaret's starring role on YouTube.

01:27:53.600 --> 01:27:58.312
4,458,207 hits at last count.

01:27:59.981 --> 01:28:01.719
Three of them mine.

01:28:04.736 --> 01:28:08.307
And me, he'd have laughed at me. A lot.

01:28:08.407 --> 01:28:10.267
And my main regret,

01:28:10.367 --> 01:28:12.519
apart from not having
a bit more time with Dad,

01:28:12.619 --> 01:28:17.164
is that he couldn't see us all
running around like idiots.

01:28:19.042 --> 01:28:21.903
I'm sure many of you believe
that he can see us,

01:28:22.003 --> 01:28:25.365
but for my part, I think death is it.

01:28:25.465 --> 01:28:28.801
I... I think life...

01:28:30.095 --> 01:28:34.374
This life is all you get,
and Gordie McLeod had a hell of a life,

01:28:34.474 --> 01:28:38.962
and so should we
cos that's all death is good for.

01:28:39.062 --> 01:28:41.298
It's to give us a kick up the arse

01:28:41.398 --> 01:28:43.816
and say, "Get on with it,
and love those around you."

01:28:45.527 --> 01:28:51.824
And... and now my wonderful son,
Kenneth, is gonna play something.

01:28:57.539 --> 01:29:00.040
No, no. Play something he'd like.

01:29:01.418 --> 01:29:03.502
Go mental.

01:30:03.522 --> 01:30:05.674
He lives in that
and then he walks around in it.

01:30:05.774 --> 01:30:08.135
That keeps his back end all safe.

01:30:08.235 --> 01:30:11.054
- So he doesn't show his bottom?
- Exactly.

01:30:11.154 --> 01:30:12.556
He keeps it in a shell.

01:30:12.656 --> 01:30:14.933
Can we do that with a large shell?

01:30:15.033 --> 01:30:17.811
Listen, kids, we...

01:30:17.911 --> 01:30:22.399
Dad and me, we just wanted to...
to say something.

01:30:22.499 --> 01:30:24.943
We know that
we've not behaved very well recently

01:30:25.043 --> 01:30:30.115
and, er... well, we just
wanted to say sorry.

01:30:30.215 --> 01:30:31.283
That's right.

01:30:31.383 --> 01:30:35.328
And, while we'll still be living apart,

01:30:35.428 --> 01:30:38.707
in different... different houses,

01:30:38.807 --> 01:30:44.103
we, er... from now on,
we're going to behave like grown-ups.

01:30:50.443 --> 01:30:51.777
Inappropriate behaviour!

01:30:51.903 --> 01:30:55.239
- Lottie, write that down in your book.
- I've chucked the book away.

01:30:57.784 --> 01:30:59.827
I don't think I'll need it any more.

01:31:14.092 --> 01:31:16.010
Get him!

01:31:22.434 --> 01:31:25.227
Get him. Get Dad! Get Dad!

01:31:25.312 --> 01:31:27.187
Come on, then!
