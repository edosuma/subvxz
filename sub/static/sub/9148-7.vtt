00:07.302 --> 00:12.472
<i>There he is,
soaked in our brother's blood,</i>

00:12.472 --> 00:15.372
<i>literally redhanded.</i>

00:15.372 --> 00:18.872
Take the shot, Councilwoman.

00:24.882 --> 00:26.712
<i>What the...?
I know! Crazy!</i>

00:26.712 --> 00:28.452
<i>How did this even happen?!</i>

00:31.552 --> 00:34.052
<i>Well, it all started
when I was in 8th grade.</i>

00:34.062 --> 00:36.222
<i>You know the 8th-grade
Washington, D.C. trip?</i>

00:36.222 --> 00:38.292
<i>Well, ours, we had to present a flag</i>

00:38.292 --> 00:41.062
<i>to Senator
Ben Nighthorse Campbell ...</i>

00:41.062 --> 00:43.332
<i>awesome name ... and I was
the kid they chose to do it.</i>

00:43.332 --> 00:45.062
<i>Now, because I was a huge kid</i>

00:45.072 --> 00:47.472
<i>and because Henchmen don't
do that much research,</i>

00:47.472 --> 00:50.872
<i>I got kidnapped, instead of
Senator Nighthorse Campbell.</i>

00:55.142 --> 00:59.042
<i>You just have to sign this
and, then, we'll let you go.</i>

00:59.052 --> 01:01.412
It's a harmless little law
I'd like you to instate.

01:01.422 --> 01:05.852
It simply makes the
surname Venture illegal!

01:05.852 --> 01:07.622
Nyah!

01:07.622 --> 01:09.522
<i>Isn't that awesome?!
Like he wasn't gonna</i>

01:09.522 --> 01:11.622
<i>ransom the senator, or anything.</i>

01:11.632 --> 01:14.292
<i>He just wanted to make
Dr. Venture's name illegal.</i>

01:14.302 --> 01:16.902
<i>It sounds idiotic, right?
But just think about it:</i>

01:16.902 --> 01:19.702
<i>Every time Dr. Venture orders pizza</i>

01:19.702 --> 01:21.932
<i>or like tries to cash
a check, or anything,</i>

01:21.942 --> 01:23.342
<i>Boom! they arrest his ass.</i>

01:23.342 --> 01:24.972
- Classic Monarch!
- Ahhh!

01:24.972 --> 01:28.042
I'm telling you, sir...
you have the wrong person.

01:28.042 --> 01:31.312
Who the hell is Gary Fischer?!

01:31.312 --> 01:33.612
Me! I-I'm Gary Fischer!

01:33.612 --> 01:36.012
You morons kidnapped the wrong guy!

01:36.022 --> 01:39.002
But he had the flag
and he looked way more

01:39.002 --> 01:42.552
senatorial than the other
guy 'cause he... flag.

01:42.582 --> 01:44.562
Sir, as team leader,
I accept the full resp...

01:44.562 --> 01:46.022
Get rid of this idiot.

01:46.032 --> 01:47.292
Him, too.

01:47.292 --> 01:49.962
<i>They didn't kill me, obviously.
They recruited me.</i>

01:49.962 --> 01:52.232
<i>I became a Henchman for the
Mighty Monarch on that day</i>

01:52.232 --> 01:56.202
<i>and never looked back.
I never finished 8th grade, either.</i>

01:56.202 --> 01:57.672
<i>I got my GED later, though.</i>

01:57.672 --> 01:59.472
<i>You know, in case
henching didn't pan out,</i>

01:59.472 --> 02:01.142
<i>it is good to have a fallback.</i>

02:01.142 --> 02:02.442
How does he do it?!

02:02.442 --> 02:06.482
Every time I think I've got
him in my grip, he slithers out!

02:06.482 --> 02:11.722
You mark my words, you little worm.
I will get you,

02:11.722 --> 02:15.092
Dr. Heinie!
See? Not cool.

02:15.092 --> 02:16.862
- Am I the only one seeing this?
- Well, I'm not gonna pretend

02:16.862 --> 02:19.962
that it's worthy of the
spin, but it's just temporary.

02:19.962 --> 02:22.032
Plus, Dr. Heinie is kinda famous.

02:22.032 --> 02:25.332
His laser-hemorrhoid-removal
posters are all over the subway.

02:25.332 --> 02:27.532
It'll totally make the
papers when you thwart him.

02:27.542 --> 02:29.302
- It's a good thwart.
- Wasted thwart.

02:29.302 --> 02:31.372
Oh, honey, when you thwart him,

02:31.372 --> 02:35.372
you'll be a level-5 candidate and
you'll be thwarting Venture in no time.

02:35.382 --> 02:38.282
Fine!
I'll thwart Dr. Heinie.

02:38.282 --> 02:41.312
- Good. Be careful.
- Oh, of course.

02:41.322 --> 02:43.622
After all, the guy
has hemorrhoid lasers.

02:43.622 --> 02:45.452
- Oh, no!
- Sweetie, there's a vigilante

02:45.452 --> 02:47.192
out there, killing supervillains.

02:47.192 --> 02:49.022
Granted, he's only killing level 10s,

02:49.022 --> 02:50.922
but I still want you to be careful.

02:50.932 --> 02:53.632
- The Blue Morpho?
- The Blue Morpho.

02:53.632 --> 02:56.162
I'm not afraid of the Blue Morpho.

02:56.162 --> 02:58.732
<i>The Blue Morpho problem was seriously</i>

02:58.732 --> 03:01.432
<i>the last thing the Guild saw comin'.</i>

03:01.442 --> 03:03.602
<i>Everything was going great:
new headquarters,</i>

03:03.602 --> 03:06.372
<i>new Council of 13,
recruitment was on the rise,</i>

03:06.372 --> 03:08.612
<i>and then, the Blue Morpho comes back.</i>

03:08.612 --> 03:11.012
<i>The Council assembled a
taskforce to deal with it.</i>

03:11.012 --> 03:12.742
<i>We called it the Five Point Five.</i>

03:12.752 --> 03:14.652
<i>The Point Five were watch and ward, who,</i>

03:14.652 --> 03:18.122
<i>not being actual Council members,
had to sit at a kiddie table.</i>

03:18.122 --> 03:19.622
<i>I-I voted against it.</i>

03:19.622 --> 03:22.152
You know, we have
access to whatever files

03:22.162 --> 03:24.162
survived the destruction
of the old Guild.

03:24.162 --> 03:26.632
Useless. The Guild
never kept records on BM.

03:26.632 --> 03:29.432
For obvious reasons,
could you not abbreviate his name!

03:29.432 --> 03:31.962
Seconded! It sounds
as if we're discussing

03:31.972 --> 03:36.642
- a walking, talking poopy!
- Ugh. Blue Morpho was a vigilante.

03:36.642 --> 03:39.142
He never applied for
Guild arching rights.

03:39.142 --> 03:42.312
He was a menace and the
Guild put a price on his head.

03:42.312 --> 03:46.112
In 1976, that bounty was claimed.

03:46.112 --> 03:48.812
Maybe it's a revenge thing?
Who claimed the bounty?

03:48.822 --> 03:51.922
Sadly, our predecessor,
the late, great Sovereign,

03:51.922 --> 03:53.652
destroyed that information.

03:53.652 --> 03:56.392
It doesn't matter!
Me, Red Mantle, Dragoon,

03:56.392 --> 03:59.522
all the oldtimers,
remember the Blue Morpho.

03:59.532 --> 04:01.962
Yes, yes!
He wore mostly blue!

04:01.962 --> 04:04.232
Like a resplendent blue tomato!

04:04.232 --> 04:07.832
- Were there such a thing, of course.
- Yes, we get it, old friend.

04:07.842 --> 04:10.242
What you do not realize
is that the Blue Morpho

04:10.242 --> 04:12.502
was the junkyard dog of Team Venture.

04:12.512 --> 04:13.872
- Oh, was he?
- Indeed.

04:13.872 --> 04:16.712
If there was a dirty job
that the squeaky-clean

04:16.712 --> 04:20.712
Jonas Venture needed done,
he sent the Blue Morpho.

04:20.712 --> 04:23.352
I remember, in 1973,

04:23.352 --> 04:25.752
<i>Keppel Harbor, Singapore.</i>

04:25.752 --> 04:29.322
<i>I had just spent the night with
tennis great Billie Jean King,</i>

04:29.322 --> 04:32.192
<i>performing my own battle of the sexes.</i>

04:32.192 --> 04:35.992
Mmm, perfect.
40-love.

04:36.002 --> 04:38.702
There is nothing a man
hopped up on ginkgo biloba

04:38.702 --> 04:41.532
and paradise white cannot
do beneath the sheets.

04:41.542 --> 04:43.742
Do you know why I'm here?

04:43.742 --> 04:46.812
Because I seduced you with
my perfect animal charm

04:46.812 --> 04:48.512
and my slim, hairless asian body

04:48.512 --> 04:50.512
appears vaguely feminine
in this light?

04:50.512 --> 04:54.052
No.
I was sent here.

04:54.052 --> 04:56.252
By Jonas Venture.

04:56.252 --> 04:58.422
Now, why don't you hand
over the Jade Dragon

04:58.422 --> 05:01.992
before I spray your
brains all over that wall.

05:01.992 --> 05:05.892
<i>I complied, of course.
It was all kinds of scary.</i>

05:05.892 --> 05:09.732
<i>But here is the part that has
been troubling me for 40 years:</i>

05:09.732 --> 05:12.802
<i>I performed every known
sexual act that night!</i>

05:12.802 --> 05:13.932
<i>I mean, everything!</i>

05:13.932 --> 05:15.572
<i>I don't know if he
did a ... a switcheroo</i>

05:15.572 --> 05:19.742
<i>or he just had a superduper
costume, but I made tender, </i>

05:19.782 --> 05:22.942
yet purely accidental,
love to the Blue Morpho.

05:22.942 --> 05:25.982
So when I tell you that
he would've done anything

05:25.982 --> 05:28.882
for Jonas Venture,
you can bet your sweet bippy

05:28.882 --> 05:30.082
that I. Mean. Anything.

05:30.082 --> 05:33.252
Dr. Z, have you no
sense of decency, sir?

05:33.252 --> 05:35.692
What? It was the 1970s!

05:35.692 --> 05:37.892
So I ask you to chill
and cut me some slack.

05:37.892 --> 05:40.332
My point is that, if you want to find

05:40.332 --> 05:44.202
this new Blue Morpho, you
must start with one man:

05:44.202 --> 05:46.502
The son and heir of Jonas Venture!

05:46.502 --> 05:48.702
<i>This has to go like clockwork.</i>

05:48.702 --> 05:52.202
This family has been shot
at, shot down, and shot from,

05:52.212 --> 05:54.242
more times than any
other family in history.

05:54.242 --> 05:57.382
- We are Ventures!
- This is like a dream I once had ...

05:57.382 --> 05:59.082
- Not you guys, obviously.
- Yeah, obviously.

05:59.082 --> 06:00.612
Brock, Hatred,

06:00.612 --> 06:02.552
I'm gonna want full-security
vigilance from you two.

06:02.552 --> 06:04.882
The second he arrives,
I want him to feel like he's

06:04.892 --> 06:06.122
as safe as a kitten.

06:06.122 --> 06:08.092
- Can do!
- What should we do?

06:08.092 --> 06:12.092
You two have only one job:
Do not embarrass me. That's it.

06:12.092 --> 06:14.992
This is the most important
night of your father's life.

06:15.002 --> 06:17.462
<i>All right, let me just
back this up a tink.</i>

06:17.462 --> 06:21.032
<i>Last week, I went to a swankass party
to make some connections.</i>

06:21.042 --> 06:22.802
<i>Nothing but a bunch numbskulls</i>

06:22.802 --> 06:24.802
<i>who never accomplished
anything themselves,</i>

06:24.812 --> 06:27.642
<i>yet, they look down on
someone who stood on the Moon.</i>

06:27.642 --> 06:30.842
<i>The Moon!
I was 7 years old.</i>

06:30.842 --> 06:33.812
- Let's do this.
- Business cards and cell numbers.

06:33.812 --> 06:36.052
Exactly. No "I'll call
you when blah blah blah"

06:36.052 --> 06:37.722
and, if they ask you
why you're there, say,

06:37.722 --> 06:39.722
"why, dear, dear Gloria invited us."

06:39.722 --> 06:42.722
- Are we sure there's a Gloria here?
- There's always a Gloria.

06:42.722 --> 06:43.822
Always a Gloria!

06:43.822 --> 06:46.062
<i>I don't care who you are, I promise you:</i>

06:46.062 --> 06:48.162
<i>your life is better than
these wealthy morons.</i>

06:48.162 --> 06:49.802
<i>All they do is complain.</i>

06:49.802 --> 06:52.402
<i>They're like a dog tied up in
the backyard with nothing to do:</i>

06:52.402 --> 06:53.672
<i>they end up gnawing off their hair</i>

06:53.672 --> 06:55.432
<i>and getting obsessed with a frisbee.</i>

06:55.442 --> 06:57.472
Ah, we struck out.
How'd it go with you?

06:57.472 --> 07:01.452
- They won't even talk to me.
- That's because you're not him.

07:01.492 --> 07:04.412
- Who's "him"?
- Him is Christopher Lam-burt.

07:04.412 --> 07:07.182
The Highlander, Christopher Lambert?

07:07.182 --> 07:09.012
Exactly. Wouldn't even look at us.

07:09.022 --> 07:12.452
You get him, we have all of
these chumps in our pocket.

07:12.452 --> 07:16.392
<i>Christopher motherfucking Lambert.</i>

07:16.392 --> 07:18.762
<i>The Lord of the Apes, Lord Rayden,</i>

07:18.762 --> 07:20.562
<i>and once Lord of Diane Lane!</i>

07:20.562 --> 07:24.102
<i>The guy had sex with Diane Lane!
Multiple times!</i>

07:24.102 --> 07:26.632
<i>There he was, sitting on
a couch, eating pâté.</i>

07:26.632 --> 07:28.802
<i>In real life, he looks
a lot like Ted Danson,</i>

07:28.802 --> 07:32.842
<i>but with a kind of magic
that only a Lambert has ...</i>

07:32.842 --> 07:37.082
<i>Chris has.
His friends call him Chris.</i>

07:37.082 --> 07:41.482
- Ready, Kano?
- Ready, Blue Morpho!

07:41.482 --> 07:43.922
<i>Engage costume pods.</i>

07:43.922 --> 07:46.022
Where's my Morpho suit?!

07:46.022 --> 07:48.022
You're wearing the old
black and gold tonight,

07:48.022 --> 07:49.822
so I brought the Morpho
suit in to be fixed.

07:49.822 --> 07:52.722
It had 1970s kevlar
flaking off the lining.

07:52.732 --> 07:54.192
Dude! That's ...
You can't bring that

07:54.192 --> 07:56.632
- to a fucking dry cleaners.
- Oh, my god, chill.

07:56.632 --> 07:58.162
There is this place
right in Little Italy.

07:58.172 --> 08:00.832
They specialize in antagonist
and protagonist costumes.

08:00.832 --> 08:02.992
It's like a Swiss Bank.
We're cool.

08:03.022 --> 08:05.272
Enh. I can't say I missed this crown.

08:05.272 --> 08:07.372
Stupid thing is always falling off.

08:07.372 --> 08:09.242
Aggh! I wish I could
go with you tonight!

08:09.242 --> 08:11.882
Dude, I have to be kickin'
that hemorrhoid guy's ass

08:11.882 --> 08:14.582
when your Morpho kill goes down.
That's the whole point!

08:14.582 --> 08:16.622
Up goes our EMA arching level;

08:16.622 --> 08:19.852
- down goes our suspicion level. Duh.
- Yeah, I know.

08:19.852 --> 08:22.152
But the next guy on our
list is the Wandering Spider.

08:22.162 --> 08:25.162
Oh, please, the guy's
a has-been and a lush.

08:25.162 --> 08:26.692
He killed Mr. Energy!

08:26.692 --> 08:30.002
Mr. Energy electrocuted himself,
watering his lawn.

08:30.002 --> 08:33.472
Wandering Spider just altered his report
to live off his arching insurance.

08:33.472 --> 08:36.842
Sovereign-era Guild shenanigans.
Nothing to be scared of.

08:36.842 --> 08:38.802
Just fly his ass to the Pine Barrens,

08:38.812 --> 08:41.942
execute him during the
eclipse, and bury him!

08:41.942 --> 08:43.912
Why can't I thwart Dr. Heinie?!

08:43.912 --> 08:47.012
Right at the eclipse!
You big baby.

08:47.012 --> 08:51.052
Enzo, it's your favorite client.

08:51.052 --> 08:55.492
Eh, Dr. The Rusty.
You look like a million dollars.

08:55.492 --> 08:58.762
And this fine boy is yours, no?

08:58.762 --> 09:02.492
- Uh, that's Dean.
- Dean! Such a manly name, huh?

09:02.502 --> 09:05.502
Want I to make him a perfect speedsuit
to show off his manly curves?

09:05.502 --> 09:06.832
We're not here for Dean.

09:06.832 --> 09:11.542
I have to ask you if
you've ever made anyone

09:11.542 --> 09:14.742
- the Patriarch.
- The Patriarch?

09:14.742 --> 09:17.112
Where did you ever hear Enzo do this?

09:17.112 --> 09:19.912
Enzo never give names
of his clients, never!

09:19.912 --> 09:23.482
- He eat poison before he tell.
- Enzo, I've seen it!

09:23.482 --> 09:25.082
It was the most beautiful speedsuit

09:25.092 --> 09:29.092
I've ever laid my eyes on
and, goddamn it, I want one.

09:29.092 --> 09:31.422
Make me the Patriarch.

09:31.452 --> 09:34.062
No-o-o!
Not the Patriarch.

09:34.062 --> 09:38.562
She is a bitch.
Each gold thread twisted by hand,

09:38.572 --> 09:41.732
each bead shaped from tiny pearls.

09:41.742 --> 09:44.602
She's lined with calf and silk!

09:44.612 --> 09:46.342
No! Why you want the Patriarch?

09:46.342 --> 09:48.972
Because I'm throwing a
little lunar eclipse party

09:48.982 --> 09:53.782
- and I've invited Christopher Lam...
- You shut that!

09:53.782 --> 09:55.982
Okay. This man you speak of.

09:55.982 --> 09:59.022
Maybe I know his tastes.
Maybe I just guess.

09:59.022 --> 10:02.992
But, he is a classic.
Enzo make you a tuxedo, eh?

10:02.992 --> 10:06.592
- A tuxedo in midnight blue.
- Blue tuxedo?

10:06.592 --> 10:09.392
Height of fashion.
Who make the blue tuxedo famous?

10:09.402 --> 10:12.862
Duke of Windsor! Most stylish
man ever in history of world.

10:12.872 --> 10:16.942
Maybe Enzo make his tuxedo, even?
Enzo never tell.

10:16.942 --> 10:19.302
Ha! I get you samples.
You wait.

10:19.312 --> 10:23.812
So, uh, how long will it
take to make this thing?

10:23.812 --> 10:25.982
<i>For you, favorite client?</i>

10:25.982 --> 10:29.112
<i>Two, perhaps three, weeks.
No more.</i>

10:29.122 --> 10:34.152
Okay. Um, hey, I gotta run,
but, I'll be back soon.

10:34.152 --> 10:35.992
Just ... okay, back soon.

10:35.992 --> 10:39.892
I'm leaving now!
Gonna go arching!

10:39.892 --> 10:42.392
<i>I'm so proud of you, sweetie.</i>

10:42.402 --> 10:43.702
<i>Are you taking #21 with you?</i>

10:43.702 --> 10:46.432
Yeah, he's already at the bus station.

10:46.432 --> 10:50.102
Ahh, the Monarch!
So good to see you in your colors.

10:50.102 --> 10:51.942
I have a rather pressing matter

10:51.942 --> 10:54.072
- for your wife, so may I...?
- Kitchen.

10:54.072 --> 10:55.572
All right.

10:57.000 --> 11:03.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

11:06.052 --> 11:07.222
Ah.

11:07.222 --> 11:09.392
<i>Hey, can I get a hand here?</i>

11:09.392 --> 11:10.962
Damn cast. I can't ...

11:10.962 --> 11:13.862
You know, I broke my
arm, so, if you could just

11:13.862 --> 11:15.632
give me a hand and we can
just get that in there.

11:15.632 --> 11:17.102
Yeah, that's not going to work.

11:17.102 --> 11:20.032
All right, if you just get in
and I'll just kind of tip it.

11:20.032 --> 11:21.872
You know, tip it and you can pull it.

11:21.872 --> 11:24.042
<i>- Dios mío.</i>
- Get a scooch in there.

11:24.042 --> 11:27.042
- Okay, just edge it in.
- You're like, what, like ...

11:27.042 --> 11:29.472
like a Wandering Spider, or something?

11:29.482 --> 11:35.052
- Who the hell are you?
- I'm Blue Morpho.

11:36.762 --> 11:39.462
<i>So what's all this crap about levels? </i>

11:39.462 --> 11:42.172
<i>Level 10, level 4, level whatever.</i>

11:42.172 --> 11:43.602
<i>It's not that confusing.</i>

11:43.602 --> 11:46.572
<i>EMA level means equally
matched aggression level.</i>

11:46.572 --> 11:48.972
<i>It all started with ... that's right ...</i>

11:48.972 --> 11:51.312
<i>the original Dr. Venture.</i>

11:51.312 --> 11:53.512
<i>See, 50 years ago, there
was this freshman villain</i>

11:53.512 --> 11:54.612
<i>called Turnbuckle.</i>

11:54.612 --> 11:57.552
<i>No fancy car, no
weapons, no clue, right?</i>

11:57.552 --> 11:59.952
<i>He shows up at the Venture
compound and snatches Rusty</i>

11:59.952 --> 12:03.222
<i>from his playpen, or
whatever, and demands a fight.</i>

12:03.222 --> 12:06.162
Step away from the boy.

12:06.162 --> 12:09.192
Caution.
You face Tu-r-rnbuckle.

12:09.192 --> 12:11.892
My punch is devastating.

12:11.902 --> 12:15.362
Step the fuck away from the boy!

12:15.372 --> 12:18.502
<i>The guy puts up his
dukes like a total douche.</i>

12:18.502 --> 12:20.802
<i>So the Action Man, because
he's a full-on psycho,</i>

12:20.812 --> 12:23.572
<i>pistol-whips him into the
ground like a tent pole.</i>

12:23.582 --> 12:25.982
<i>And then, this Turnbuckle,
he looks up and says...</i>

12:25.982 --> 12:29.082
Kiss my ass.

12:29.082 --> 12:33.352
<i>Click. Takes one right in the brain.
Not equal.</i>

12:33.352 --> 12:35.122
<i>So they came up with this system.</i>

12:35.122 --> 12:38.622
<i>You have huge balls, a deadly
partner, armed headquarters,</i>

12:38.622 --> 12:41.022
<i>a huge Henchman army, and a flying car,</i>

12:41.032 --> 12:43.132
<i>you're like a level 9 or 10.</i>

12:43.132 --> 12:45.462
<i>If you just have a
sidekick and enough change</i>

12:45.462 --> 12:48.702
<i>to ride the New Jersey path train,
you're a 4.</i>

12:48.702 --> 12:50.072
<i>Guess who's a 4.</i>

12:50.122 --> 12:52.292
Come, now.
What more do you need?

12:52.292 --> 12:54.552
Wide Wale's surveillance
tapes clearly show

12:54.562 --> 12:56.992
that Dr. Venture was
dressed as Blue Morpho.

12:56.992 --> 13:00.462
Illegally obtained surveillance
footage isn't enough to move on.

13:00.462 --> 13:02.502
And what of this grapple gun we salvaged

13:02.502 --> 13:04.102
from the wreck of the Doom Factory?

13:04.102 --> 13:08.402
Look, here are the mechanics.
That is the Venture Industries logo.

13:08.402 --> 13:11.242
He all but left his
business card to taunt us.

13:11.242 --> 13:13.312
Okay, listen, we'll
assemble the Five Point Five

13:13.312 --> 13:14.442
and we're gonna deal
with this by the ...

13:14.442 --> 13:16.312
- Open your eyes, woman!
- Book.

13:16.312 --> 13:17.742
Not another one of us will die!

13:17.752 --> 13:21.452
This list, it's not just
random level-10 villains.

13:21.452 --> 13:24.052
This is a list of Dr. Venture's
arching rights.

13:24.052 --> 13:27.452
He has been killing his
way through this list.

13:27.462 --> 13:28.862
Well, why?
He wouldn't do that.

13:28.862 --> 13:31.892
I've watched him stand on a chair
because he saw a cockroach!

13:31.892 --> 13:34.432
Money, power, greed!
They change people.

13:34.432 --> 13:36.102
We must stop this tonight!

13:36.102 --> 13:40.402
Not as Guild members, but
as brethren. As villains!

13:40.402 --> 13:43.572
- Who's next on the list?
- The Wandering Spider.

13:43.572 --> 13:45.372
Well, we should call him right away.

13:45.372 --> 13:49.142
- Maybe he ...
- Don't bother. We have, and he is missing.

13:49.142 --> 13:51.482
Come with me. We have
only moments to spare!

13:51.782 --> 13:54.552
<i>I don't wanna kill anyone.</i>

13:54.552 --> 13:57.822
<i>Yeah, I know, I'm a Henchman.
That's what we do: kill.</i>

13:57.822 --> 13:59.322
<i>You know, back in the Monarch crew,</i>

13:59.322 --> 14:00.722
<i>we called it "getting your wings".</i>

14:00.722 --> 14:02.962
<i>I was 16 when I got my wings.</i>

14:02.962 --> 14:06.692
<i>So, we're arching this guy
called Professor Vibrations.</i>

14:06.692 --> 14:08.562
<i>Hippie creampuff, fought all his battles</i>

14:08.562 --> 14:11.162
<i>with robots and some vibrogun thing.</i>

14:11.172 --> 14:13.032
<i>So lame, but he was still nuts.</i>

14:13.032 --> 14:15.802
<i>So I'm looking for a
place to hide my fat ass,</i>

14:15.802 --> 14:18.502
<i>'cause I'm 16 and I'm terrified</i>

14:18.512 --> 14:20.242
<i>and who do I all but knock over?</i>

14:20.242 --> 14:23.342
<i>Professor Vibrations.
He had me dead to rights.</i>

14:23.342 --> 14:26.552
<i>Could've vibrated my head off.
And then, he suddenly died.</i>

14:26.552 --> 14:28.752
<i>Like of happiness, or something.</i>

14:28.752 --> 14:30.222
<i>No, that happens!</i>

14:30.222 --> 14:31.782
<i>Remember that videogame "Berserk"?</i>

14:31.792 --> 14:34.992
<i>In like 1981, this kid
named Jeff Dailey died</i>

14:34.992 --> 14:36.622
<i>right after he got a high score.</i>

14:36.622 --> 14:39.792
<i>"Got the humanoid!"
Clunk, dead.</i>

14:39.792 --> 14:43.962
<i>Then, like a year later,
another kid dies, the same way.</i>

14:43.972 --> 14:45.462
<i>Of happiness!</i>

14:47.802 --> 14:50.972
Margaret, would you please
send in the next patient?

14:50.972 --> 14:54.512
- M-Margaret?
- I guess that would be me.

14:54.512 --> 14:59.382
I have a huge pain in my ass, doctor.

15:01.282 --> 15:03.782
<i>Ah, these fucking old-time villains.</i>

15:03.782 --> 15:07.592
<i>The second things get hairy, they
scrap protocol and do it their way.</i>

15:07.592 --> 15:09.422
<i>But something inside me wanted this.</i>

15:09.422 --> 15:13.132
<i>All the diehards, the kooks,
the real villains, the crazies,</i>

15:13.132 --> 15:14.732
<i>the blood-starved animals,</i>

15:14.732 --> 15:16.502
<i>they're all assembled at Wide Wale's.</i>

15:16.502 --> 15:18.502
<i>They're starin' down a gun barrel,</i>

15:18.502 --> 15:21.372
<i>Just waitin' for Dr. Venture to mess up.</i>

15:21.372 --> 15:25.442
<i>I'm ashamed to say it, but,
I hope he does.</i>

15:25.512 --> 15:27.742
Hey, look, free water!

15:28.042 --> 15:29.582
What are you doing?

15:29.582 --> 15:33.212
I meant like create mood lighting
and conversation corners.

15:33.212 --> 15:35.782
This looks like a baby
shower for a teen mom.

15:35.782 --> 15:39.182
I tried to stop him, but
then, I appreciated the irony.

15:39.192 --> 15:40.592
What are these?

15:40.592 --> 15:43.462
- They're the eclipse viewers you wanted.
- They're novelty glasses!

15:43.462 --> 15:44.822
You look at an eclipse through these

15:44.832 --> 15:46.362
and your eyes will
melt out of your head.

15:46.362 --> 15:48.992
- They don't even have lenses!
- Doc, this is a lunar eclipse.

15:49.002 --> 15:52.402
- You don't have to wear anything to ...
- Shh! We get paid for those.

15:52.402 --> 15:56.442
Oh, yeah!
They're all sprayed with eclipsium.

15:56.442 --> 15:58.602
They stop radiation
and magic space stuff.

15:58.612 --> 16:00.542
Oh, good. Safety first.

16:00.542 --> 16:02.612
- And the hats?
- Also coated with eclipsium.

16:02.612 --> 16:04.382
Hmm.
You might want to give 'em

16:04.382 --> 16:06.012
another couple coats.
Me and Chris ...

16:06.012 --> 16:09.682
Lambert, of course...
have sensitive heads.

16:22.402 --> 16:23.832
Oh, my God, you're heavy!

16:23.832 --> 16:27.002
You wearing a flak vest, or something?

16:27.002 --> 16:30.342
Whoa!
Ah! What the hell?!

16:34.072 --> 16:37.182
Dude...
a-are you awake?

16:37.182 --> 16:39.582
Hey! You awake?

16:39.582 --> 16:42.152
Ow. All right, I just
did that to myself.

16:42.152 --> 16:44.722
Just my luck.

16:44.722 --> 16:47.252
Aw, crap, it's fallin' asleep.

16:47.252 --> 16:49.462
<i>Ah! Heh...</i>

16:49.462 --> 16:51.292
<i>I guess he's going to
be fashionably late.</i>

16:51.292 --> 16:53.462
Or fashionably somewhere better.

16:53.462 --> 16:55.092
Oh, my God.
Did you invite anybody else?

16:55.102 --> 16:57.362
Like your mom, or maybe that fox

16:57.372 --> 16:59.602
from the Carfax commercial?

16:59.602 --> 17:01.572
- The Carfax Fox.
- He's already drunk.

17:01.572 --> 17:04.571
I just figured Chris would invite
all his fancy friends.

17:04.571 --> 17:07.271
What can I get ya, slim?
Why don'tcha pour out your heart,

17:07.271 --> 17:08.642
as I pour out a stiff one.

17:08.642 --> 17:11.442
Hank's the name and this
here's me waterin' hole.

17:11.452 --> 17:12.952
Stop, Hank.

17:12.952 --> 17:15.512
Fine.
How about a Ruddy Bottom.

17:15.521 --> 17:16.752
Yeah, unless the name of the drink

17:16.752 --> 17:18.722
includes the ingredients,
I can't help ya.

17:18.722 --> 17:21.592
Perhaps a gin and tonic
that's made of gin and tonic?

17:21.592 --> 17:24.122
You know what?
It's time you learned a doctail.

17:24.132 --> 17:25.521
The Ruddy Bottom.

17:25.531 --> 17:29.632
That's tall-glass grenadine with
tomato juice and a jigger of rum.

17:29.632 --> 17:32.062
Sweet!
I'll have a Ruddy Bottom, too.

17:32.072 --> 17:35.102
But, instead of
grenadine, I'll have rum.

17:35.102 --> 17:37.942
And replace the tomato: also rum.

17:37.942 --> 17:39.712
Yeah-eah-eah. All right.

17:39.712 --> 17:43.682
This is how it's done.
This is how we did it back in the day,

17:43.682 --> 17:48.052
when you didn't have to check
with mommy to protect what's yours.

17:48.052 --> 17:51.682
This is so exciting!
Like when we were young and dumb

17:51.692 --> 17:53.822
and everything was pointy and dangerous.

17:53.822 --> 17:56.662
- What have we missed?
- Oh, you just missed jack squat.

17:56.662 --> 17:58.662
This is crazy, you guys.

17:58.662 --> 18:01.092
Let's just all relax
and think this over.

18:01.102 --> 18:04.532
Ahh, we gotta do another one.

18:04.532 --> 18:06.032
Crown was all messed
up in that last one.

18:06.032 --> 18:09.202
And look more terrified, will ya?
Like I'm totally badass.

18:09.202 --> 18:11.742
Oh, I am terrified!
Please, let me go.

18:11.742 --> 18:13.542
Well, act it!
Look like you're laughing

18:13.542 --> 18:14.872
in half the pictures.

18:14.882 --> 18:16.012
Some people laugh when they're nervous.

18:16.012 --> 18:18.612
What do you want from me?
I'm tied to a thing.

18:21.582 --> 18:23.352
Well!
It's time for the eclipse.

18:23.352 --> 18:26.592
I'm gonna go out and view.
Any takers?

18:26.592 --> 18:29.992
- Ah, maybe later.
- I'ma na-nap for a bit.

18:29.992 --> 18:32.932
Ah! Nice.
You got Ruddy Bottom all over me.

18:43.372 --> 18:44.642
All right.

18:49.612 --> 18:50.912
Oh, what?
Wh-What's going on?

18:50.912 --> 18:53.882
Where are we?
Is ... Is that my phone?

18:53.882 --> 18:55.612
Yeah. I want you to say
you've been kidnapped

18:55.622 --> 18:57.022
by the Blue Morpho and that you're

18:57.022 --> 18:59.822
- in a forest, about to be executed.
- Ah! Is that true?

18:59.822 --> 19:01.092
A-Are you gonna execute me?

19:01.092 --> 19:03.492
Dude, say exactly what I just said.

19:03.492 --> 19:06.362
It's ... it's still ringing!

19:06.362 --> 19:07.862
Wh-Why are you doing this?

19:07.862 --> 19:09.332
Do you want money?
I can get you money.

19:09.332 --> 19:11.062
<i>This is Guild Councilwoman
Dr. Mrs. The Monarch.</i>

19:11.072 --> 19:13.132
- Oh! It's going to voicemail.
- Well, leave a message!

19:13.132 --> 19:16.442
Th-That won't really help me!
Will it?

19:19.642 --> 19:22.912
- The eclipse has started.
- That's not all that's started.

19:22.912 --> 19:24.582
It looks like that
Blue Morpho there likes

19:24.582 --> 19:27.612
to dance in the moonlight after a kill.

19:30.852 --> 19:32.792
Agh! Thanks, Billy.

19:32.792 --> 19:35.922
I'm all sticky with grenadine.
Idiot.

19:35.922 --> 19:39.462
Huh? Oh.
That really is beautiful.

19:39.462 --> 19:43.202
A-A-And, sending it now.
It's a good one.

19:43.202 --> 19:44.802
Hey, you want me to put
one on your homepage?

19:44.802 --> 19:47.132
<i>Please don't.
You don't have to do this.</i>

19:47.132 --> 19:49.002
<i>Y-You don't have to do this.</i>

19:49.002 --> 19:53.042
<i>You don't have to do ...</i>

19:55.812 --> 20:00.782
- Look for yourself, Councilwoman.
- Oh my God.

20:00.782 --> 20:04.522
<i>There he is, soaked
in our brother's blood,</i>

20:04.522 --> 20:06.952
literally redhanded.

20:06.952 --> 20:10.022
I-I can't believe this.
This is not happening.

20:10.022 --> 20:13.012
Take the shot, Councilwoman.
Do you want to be

20:13.012 --> 20:15.992
remembered as the bureaucratic
coward that hesitated?

20:16.002 --> 20:17.532
What, do gotta see, Dr. Venture

20:17.532 --> 20:20.732
<i>slit your husband's throat
before you end this madness?</i>

20:20.732 --> 20:23.602
<i>Madam, I beg you,
shoot him or step aside!</i>

20:23.602 --> 20:26.982
He's a killer!

20:29.482 --> 20:31.442
<i>Sometimes you do something and you know,</i>

20:31.452 --> 20:35.182
<i>that second, you'll regret
it for the rest of your life.</i>

20:35.182 --> 20:38.782
<i>But you had to make that choice!
You saw no other way!</i>

20:38.792 --> 20:40.922
<i>You're a tiny part of a big machine.</i>

20:40.922 --> 20:44.092
<i>And you feel small,
like you don't matter,</i>

20:44.092 --> 20:47.392
<i>but it's so beautiful,
you're okay with it.</i>

20:47.392 --> 20:49.602
Agh!

20:50.602 --> 20:53.902
<i>Well, that's it.
Dr. Venture's dead.</i>

20:53.902 --> 20:55.672
<i>And nobody cared.</i>

20:55.672 --> 20:58.972
<i>His friends, his family, his bodyguard,</i>

20:58.972 --> 21:03.642
<i>even his stupid robot,
didn't care.</i>

21:05.482 --> 21:07.812
<i>Oh, please! I'm kidding!</i>

21:07.822 --> 21:10.552
<i>That was my jacket and it
has a bulletproof lining.</i>

21:10.552 --> 21:13.592
<i>He's fine!
Idiot thought his pocket blew up.</i>

21:13.592 --> 21:16.272
<i>And, because he stole it
from a place that makes</i>

21:16.272 --> 21:18.962
<i>costumes for villains, he was
too ashamed to tell anyone.</i>

21:18.962 --> 21:20.992
<i>The next day, he returned it to Enzo's.</i>

21:21.002 --> 21:24.262
<i>He even had to pay for my tailoring.</i>

21:24.272 --> 21:26.032
<i>My wife finally checked her phone</i>

21:26.032 --> 21:28.872
<i>and found #21's message
and my awesome selfie</i>

21:28.872 --> 21:30.602
<i>and they realized what they did.</i>

21:30.602 --> 21:33.172
<i>Somehow, she still snuck
in an "I told you so."</i>

21:33.172 --> 21:34.572
<i>Like she was innocent.</i>

21:34.582 --> 21:37.512
<i>What, you're worried
about my poor Henchman?</i>

21:37.512 --> 21:41.452
<i>It's his job! Please!</i>

21:41.452 --> 21:44.052
And me?
I'm in the clear. I look great!

21:44.052 --> 21:46.522
<i>This?
This is a happy ending.</i>

Let's just try to forget
it and we're gonna m...

Right over there.
