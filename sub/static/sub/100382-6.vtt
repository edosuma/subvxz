WEBVTT

00:00.047 --> 00:01.748
Previously, on "Lincoln Rhyme"...

00:01.750 --> 00:02.882
What is the Bone Collector

00:02.884 --> 00:05.232
trying to tell us about each new murder?

00:05.265 --> 00:06.830
Jane wanted to come by and say hi.

00:06.833 --> 00:08.866
She is fascinated by what you do.

00:08.868 --> 00:10.760
You're not a very nice person, Jane.

00:10.762 --> 00:12.529
You were a good friend to Danielle.

00:12.554 --> 00:15.307
But all good things must come to an end.

00:16.224 --> 00:17.356
Our breaking story,

00:17.358 --> 00:19.392
the return of the Bone Collector.

00:19.394 --> 00:21.260
We beat the Bone Collector at his game.

00:21.262 --> 00:23.663
We're going to play a new game.

00:25.333 --> 00:27.400
So let me address
the Bone Collector directly

00:27.402 --> 00:28.846
if he's watching.

00:29.437 --> 00:32.671
For eight years,
we let you set the rules.

00:32.674 --> 00:34.574
But now we're done.

00:34.576 --> 00:37.777
We have a new game with new rules.

00:37.779 --> 00:41.214
And all you need to know is,
we're coming for you,

00:41.216 --> 00:43.152
and we will find you.

00:43.972 --> 00:46.539
We're coming for you,
and we will find you.

00:46.854 --> 00:49.658
We're coming for you,
and we will find you.

00:50.858 --> 00:53.412
We're coming for you,
and we will find you.

00:54.022 --> 00:56.582
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:00.868 --> 01:04.804
- Everything okay?
- I'm fine. Everything's fine.

01:04.806 --> 01:08.574
I got some coffee and croissants.

01:08.576 --> 01:09.942
I'm not hungry.

01:09.944 --> 01:11.544
Okay, now I know something's wrong.

01:11.546 --> 01:14.580
I told you, I'm fine.

01:17.485 --> 01:19.652
A lot of things on my mind.

01:21.923 --> 01:23.233
Are you sure you're okay?

01:26.427 --> 01:29.198
I'm fine. Really, I am.

01:30.498 --> 01:32.117
All right, see you later.

01:38.373 --> 01:40.106
I was up all night
with the Bone Collector.

01:40.131 --> 01:43.099
- Welcome to my world.
- I was going over his profile

01:43.124 --> 01:45.757
thinking about his very first kill.

01:45.913 --> 01:47.413
Now, I don't care how good he is now,

01:47.415 --> 01:48.748
He would have made mistakes then.

01:48.750 --> 01:50.750
He most likely made plenty of mistakes.

01:50.752 --> 01:54.920
I think I found one. Barry Rotko, 17,

01:54.922 --> 01:58.291
Westchester County,
a missing persons case.

01:58.293 --> 02:01.627
30 years ago, Barry Rotko goes jogging,

02:01.629 --> 02:03.462
never comes home.

02:03.464 --> 02:06.499
Investigators find a pit dug

02:06.501 --> 02:09.602
along the jogging path, like a trap.

02:09.604 --> 02:12.605
In it, some of Rotko's blood.

02:12.607 --> 02:16.509
Oh, we know his M.O.:
kidnap, disable the victim,

02:16.511 --> 02:19.224
kill them later somewhere else.
It's possible.

02:19.226 --> 02:20.846
I had Eric request the original evidence.

02:20.848 --> 02:22.584
We should have it by tomorrow.

02:23.618 --> 02:27.320
Like you said, new game, new rules.

02:27.322 --> 02:29.955
In the meantime,
Sellitto was on his way up.

02:29.957 --> 02:31.927
I've got something else for the team.

02:33.227 --> 02:35.527
Her name is Kamala Patel,

02:35.552 --> 02:38.286
murdered in her home two nights ago.

02:38.311 --> 02:41.412
- Any suspects?
- Her husband, Raj.

02:41.437 --> 02:43.437
Witnesses heard them arguing.

02:43.471 --> 02:45.638
The location of his phone
pings him to the house

02:45.640 --> 02:47.276
at the time of the murder.

02:47.809 --> 02:50.237
His prints are on the murder weapon.

02:51.425 --> 02:54.593
Okay, I'll go out on a limb.
The guy did it.

02:54.816 --> 02:57.369
- I'll co-sign that.
- He says he didn't.

02:58.019 --> 03:01.008
But the evidence
says otherwise, doesn't it?

03:01.010 --> 03:02.499
Yes, it does.

03:03.024 --> 03:05.057
Okay, I'm lost.

03:05.544 --> 03:06.992
Evidence reveals all.

03:06.994 --> 03:08.068
What happened to that?

03:08.070 --> 03:11.831
Lincoln, I mean, you don't
usually bring us cases.

03:11.833 --> 03:13.279
Why this one?

03:13.281 --> 03:16.535
The accused, Raj Patel,
went to Columbia with Naia.

03:16.537 --> 03:18.671
She introduced him to Kamala.

03:18.673 --> 03:20.005
So you knew the victim.

03:20.007 --> 03:23.609
I did. They were both friends of mine.

03:23.979 --> 03:25.845
I'm sorry.

03:25.847 --> 03:27.847
The four of us spent
a lot of time together.

03:28.317 --> 03:29.943
I know him.

03:31.452 --> 03:32.904
Raj didn't do this.

03:34.531 --> 03:38.090
Look, I'm very sorry for your loss,

03:38.092 --> 03:40.693
and I hate to play Lincoln Rhyme here,

03:40.695 --> 03:43.396
but just because you knew the guy

03:43.398 --> 03:44.597
doesn't meant he didn't kill his wife.

03:44.599 --> 03:46.098
I realize that.

03:46.710 --> 03:48.868
But something doesn't add up.

03:49.755 --> 03:53.739
It's too neat, too obvious.

03:54.709 --> 03:56.876
So we're taking the case

03:57.971 --> 04:00.980
because the evidence is too good.

04:00.982 --> 04:02.615
Exactly.

04:02.617 --> 04:05.228
Raj is being held pending arraignment.

04:06.487 --> 04:07.753
Talk to him.

04:08.273 --> 04:10.233
Get his side of the story.

04:10.591 --> 04:13.392
Either find me something
to go on or convince me

04:13.394 --> 04:15.947
that I don't know this man
the way I think I do.

04:16.831 --> 04:18.430
I didn't do it.

04:18.433 --> 04:21.567
Please, you have to believe me.

04:21.569 --> 04:24.831
Why don't you start by
telling me about that night?

04:25.973 --> 04:27.334
What happened?

04:29.844 --> 04:32.077
- We had an argument.
- Oh, Raj, I'm sorry, okay?

04:32.079 --> 04:34.146
I'm sorry. Look, look, it's over, okay?

04:34.148 --> 04:36.093
I ended it, I swear.

04:37.018 --> 04:41.264
Kamala had strayed away
from the marriage.

04:42.523 --> 04:43.809
I was upset.

04:45.827 --> 04:47.026
I'm done.

04:47.028 --> 04:50.629
No, Raj. No. Raj.

04:50.631 --> 04:52.431
Raj.

04:52.433 --> 04:53.902
I stormed out.

05:02.944 --> 05:05.831
And I realized
that I had forgotten my keys.

05:07.782 --> 05:10.883
It was just a few minutes,

05:10.885 --> 05:14.798
but when I came back in, Kamala was...

05:21.963 --> 05:23.162
Kamala.

05:23.164 --> 05:26.999
No. No! Kamala!

05:29.343 --> 05:30.897
It was awful.

05:33.507 --> 05:36.775
There was no sign anyone
had been in the room.

05:36.911 --> 05:38.677
No. None.

05:38.679 --> 05:41.658
Is there anything you could remember

05:42.817 --> 05:44.917
that might help us figure this out?

05:47.414 --> 05:48.957
I wish there was.

05:49.590 --> 05:51.501
I've lost everything.

05:54.095 --> 05:55.338
My wife.

05:57.698 --> 05:59.092
My life.

06:01.769 --> 06:05.738
Naia always said Lincoln
can solve anything.

06:05.740 --> 06:09.241
I need Lincoln's help, please.

06:10.845 --> 06:12.711
Lincoln, I can't believe it.

06:12.713 --> 06:15.180
I just spoke with Kamala last week.

06:15.182 --> 06:17.216
She was gonna come out and visit me.

06:17.218 --> 06:20.286
It's hit me hard too knowing she's gone,

06:20.288 --> 06:21.787
Raj being in prison.

06:21.789 --> 06:23.992
There's no way he did this.

06:24.625 --> 06:26.792
You know that. There's just no way.

06:27.078 --> 06:28.694
He wouldn't.

06:28.696 --> 06:30.195
I know.

06:30.197 --> 06:31.864
You have to help him.

06:31.866 --> 06:34.503
Lincoln, he needs you.

06:35.011 --> 06:36.577
I'll do everything I can to try

06:36.579 --> 06:38.479
and find out what happened.

06:38.481 --> 06:40.181
You'll get him out of this, right?

06:40.183 --> 06:43.484
I mean, you'll find the evidence?

06:43.486 --> 06:46.890
Naia, I'll do everything I can.

06:47.924 --> 06:49.684
I trust you, Lincoln.

06:50.452 --> 06:52.952
I trust you to find the truth.

06:58.167 --> 07:00.134
It's not good, Lincoln.

07:00.837 --> 07:02.036
We just came from the morgue.

07:02.038 --> 07:03.971
There's no other traces on the body,

07:03.973 --> 07:05.784
no other prints on the knife.

07:06.209 --> 07:08.709
Amelia, you met him.

07:08.711 --> 07:11.278
You sat with him. What's your take?

07:13.516 --> 07:14.882
I think he's suffering.

07:14.884 --> 07:16.795
He just lost his wife.

07:17.620 --> 07:19.887
And when he says he's innocent...

07:19.889 --> 07:21.216
Do you believe him?

07:24.010 --> 07:25.893
I want to.

07:25.895 --> 07:28.229
Someone's been training me
not to rely on my gut.

07:29.485 --> 07:32.319
Lincoln, all due respect,

07:32.414 --> 07:34.181
I don't think we should be on this case.

07:34.206 --> 07:36.673
I think you're too emotionally involved.

07:36.706 --> 07:37.899
I agree.

07:38.975 --> 07:40.641
Look, I know he's your friend,

07:40.643 --> 07:44.545
but he looks good for this.

07:45.915 --> 07:48.082
What do you think?

07:49.485 --> 07:52.205
I trust you, Lincoln.

07:52.922 --> 07:55.022
You're not sentimental,

07:55.024 --> 07:57.586
and you're not easily swayed my emotion.

07:58.520 --> 08:01.655
So if you truly believe
the evidence is out there

08:01.680 --> 08:03.341
to exonerate him,

08:04.901 --> 08:06.600
then I say we have to go find it.

08:09.705 --> 08:17.717
Synced & corrected by -robtor-
www.addic7ed.com

08:22.884 --> 08:25.352
Okay, I'm in Kamala's art studio.

08:25.354 --> 08:29.623
There's a considerable amount of blood.

08:31.360 --> 08:33.659
I'm sorry, Lincoln.

08:33.662 --> 08:35.662
I know she was your friend.

08:35.664 --> 08:37.297
I don't need a therapist, Amelia.

08:37.299 --> 08:39.198
I just need to see.

08:39.201 --> 08:42.936
Well, I see footprints.

08:42.938 --> 08:44.771
Yes. The crime scene reports states

08:44.773 --> 08:46.540
that it belongs to Raj.

08:46.542 --> 08:49.476
He says he discovered her body,
so that's not unusual.

08:49.478 --> 08:52.431
The thing I can't figure out is,

08:52.433 --> 08:57.317
Raj said he left the house,
realized he forgot his keys,

08:57.319 --> 08:59.486
was back in three minutes tops.

08:59.488 --> 09:01.488
The killer had a simple way in.

09:05.828 --> 09:09.396
Well, the door hasn't been tampered with.

09:11.800 --> 09:13.800
Maybe Raj left it unlocked.

09:13.802 --> 09:15.080
What about the windows?

09:24.813 --> 09:26.132
Wait.

09:29.585 --> 09:30.684
See that?

09:31.429 --> 09:32.753
What?

09:32.755 --> 09:35.689
Two distinct smudges
on the outside of the glass.

09:35.691 --> 09:36.923
Get closer.

09:36.925 --> 09:38.728
Oh, yeah.

09:40.897 --> 09:42.929
Cup your hands to your face.

09:47.202 --> 09:49.870
Palm prints.

09:50.281 --> 09:52.339
The outer edges.

09:52.341 --> 09:54.374
Collect that trace.

09:54.376 --> 09:56.343
Oil from the hands will give us DNA,

09:56.345 --> 09:58.345
so we'll know
who was spying on the Patels.

09:58.347 --> 09:59.913
Or who was trying to get in.

10:01.784 --> 10:04.751
Why did we find your
palm prints on a window, Dave?

10:06.355 --> 10:07.632
You know this woman?

10:08.424 --> 10:11.625
That's Kamala, my neighbor.

10:11.627 --> 10:14.556
Those prints make it clear
you were spying on her.

10:16.031 --> 10:18.231
Kamala and me, we were friends.

10:18.233 --> 10:19.399
Neighbors look out
for each other, you know.

10:19.401 --> 10:20.701
I was checking on her.

10:20.703 --> 10:22.869
So why not knock on the door,

10:22.871 --> 10:24.538
ring the doorbell, give her a call?

10:24.540 --> 10:26.987
Because you were creeping on her, hmm?

10:27.309 --> 10:29.476
I was worried about her.

10:29.478 --> 10:31.912
Heard her fighting with
her husband a few nights ago.

10:31.914 --> 10:34.247
- I thought maybe...
- You'd just swoop in.

10:34.249 --> 10:37.370
Maybe she rejected you.

10:38.454 --> 10:43.423
You got angry, lost control.

10:43.425 --> 10:45.759
I was working the night she died.

10:45.761 --> 10:47.761
There are time logs, security cameras.

10:47.763 --> 10:49.629
You can check.

10:49.631 --> 10:52.265
You see anybody else? A guy she was with?

10:52.267 --> 10:53.928
Anything unusual?

10:54.636 --> 10:56.903
There was an electrical van
idling the whole time

10:56.905 --> 11:00.185
I was there, seemed weird to me.

11:01.643 --> 11:03.276
I don't know why you're wasting
your time with me.

11:03.278 --> 11:06.813
It was obviously her husband.
That guy has problems.

11:10.652 --> 11:12.919
Dave Chen's alibi checked out.

11:12.921 --> 11:16.456
He's a creepy perv,
but he didn't kill Kamala.

11:16.458 --> 11:18.325
And her boss,
the one she was sleeping with,

11:18.327 --> 11:20.594
his wife confirms his alibi.

11:20.596 --> 11:23.330
Lincoln, I know there are
no dead ends, but...

11:23.332 --> 11:26.633
There are no paths to follow.
I found one.

11:26.635 --> 11:29.870
I started with the hypothesis
that Raj is innocent,

11:29.872 --> 11:33.473
yet the evidence points to him.

11:35.644 --> 11:38.645
Two similar cases
within the last six months.

11:38.647 --> 11:40.547
Wives stabbed multiple times
in the torso.

11:40.549 --> 11:42.349
Witnesses heard them fighting,

11:42.351 --> 11:44.050
husbands tied to the murder scene,

11:44.052 --> 11:45.980
their prints on the murder weapon.

11:46.722 --> 11:48.388
I hate to be the naysayer here,

11:48.390 --> 11:52.459
but husbands killing
their wives, it happens.

11:52.461 --> 11:53.863
And then there's this.

11:54.797 --> 11:57.951
When you look at all three
victims, tell me what you see.

11:58.534 --> 12:01.579
- No defensive wounds.
- Right.

12:02.137 --> 12:03.837
With stabbings, you see wounds
on their hands and arms

12:03.839 --> 12:05.405
from them trying to defend themselves.

12:05.407 --> 12:06.573
Kamala was a fighter.

12:06.575 --> 12:08.475
She would have fought like hell.

12:08.477 --> 12:10.677
So you're saying there's a connection

12:10.679 --> 12:12.345
between these three cases.

12:12.347 --> 12:13.717
Let's talk to the husbands.

12:13.719 --> 12:16.719
I may have an answer to why
there are no defensive wounds.

12:17.686 --> 12:19.180
Taser marks.

12:20.098 --> 12:22.395
Uh, not seeing it.

12:22.397 --> 12:25.158
Which is why the M.E. missed it.

12:25.160 --> 12:27.527
The killer incapacitated them
with a Taser

12:27.529 --> 12:30.030
and then stabbed them over
the Taser marks to cover it up.

12:30.032 --> 12:32.032
Look. If you look closely,

12:32.034 --> 12:36.703
you can see the fractional edge
of a superficial burn here

12:36.705 --> 12:40.841
and small puncture wound
from the metal probe here.

12:40.843 --> 12:43.443
He went through a lot
of trouble to cover his tracks.

12:43.445 --> 12:45.412
We're talking one M.O. One killer.

12:45.414 --> 12:48.014
Which means Raj is innocent
and there's a serial killer

12:48.016 --> 12:50.050
out there planning the perfect murder.

12:57.893 --> 13:00.694
You've got to be kidding me.

13:29.424 --> 13:30.991
Oh, my God.

13:49.092 --> 13:50.960
I know everything points to me.

13:51.622 --> 13:52.621
But I didn't kill her.

13:52.623 --> 13:55.257
I had a one-night stand,
and she found out.

13:55.259 --> 13:56.892
But that's all I'm guilty of.

13:56.894 --> 13:59.928
We had our issues,
but what couple doesn't?

13:59.930 --> 14:01.530
I was angry.

14:01.532 --> 14:05.400
- Yes, we fought.
- I said I wished she was dead.

14:05.402 --> 14:07.469
I was only out the room for,
like, five minutes.

14:07.471 --> 14:09.271
And I know that points the finger at me,

14:09.273 --> 14:11.273
but it's not so.

14:11.275 --> 14:13.208
She was gone.

14:13.210 --> 14:17.445
I tried to stop the bleeding,
but it was too late.

14:17.447 --> 14:19.314
I had her blood all over me.

14:19.316 --> 14:22.345
It was awful.

14:24.154 --> 14:27.822
I can't unsee her
just lying there on the ground.

14:27.824 --> 14:30.659
My prints were on the knife.
Any jury would convict.

14:30.661 --> 14:34.296
My lawyer said it would
be best if I took the ten years

14:34.298 --> 14:35.830
than spend the rest of my life here.

14:35.832 --> 14:37.399
You have to believe me.

14:37.401 --> 14:39.334
I didn't do this.

14:39.336 --> 14:41.303
Someone else killed my wife.

14:41.305 --> 14:43.805
Please, you have to believe me.

14:43.807 --> 14:46.341
Got to say, these guys sound credible.

14:46.343 --> 14:47.842
Their stories are identical.

14:47.844 --> 14:49.811
Yeah, even I'm starting to believe them.

14:49.813 --> 14:52.948
We're looking at three
murders, three innocent people.

14:52.950 --> 14:54.616
You know, for somebody to do this,

14:54.618 --> 14:56.685
to time it just right, how?

14:56.687 --> 14:58.820
Start by taking a new look
at the evidence.

14:58.822 --> 15:01.856
Evidence for all three cases
organized accordingly.

15:01.858 --> 15:04.659
Good. We look at every piece of evidence,

15:04.661 --> 15:08.597
every fingerprint, every hair,
fiber, and speck of dust.

15:08.599 --> 15:11.466
Got it. Leave no stone unturned.

15:11.468 --> 15:13.335
Sounds like I should make coffee.

15:13.337 --> 15:15.189
The big pot.

15:18.542 --> 15:19.941
Can't believe I'm saying this,

15:19.943 --> 15:23.378
but I can't find anything.

15:23.380 --> 15:25.714
Hey, investigators
did their due diligence.

15:25.716 --> 15:27.449
The evidence points to the husbands.

15:27.451 --> 15:28.650
Yeah, I mean, there's no connection

15:28.652 --> 15:29.851
between these couples.

15:29.853 --> 15:31.553
I mean, they didn't know each other.

15:31.555 --> 15:33.221
They didn't go to the same places.

15:33.223 --> 15:34.856
How would the killer know to target them?

15:34.858 --> 15:36.294
I think I can help.

15:37.294 --> 15:39.047
This is from Raj's house.

15:39.830 --> 15:41.329
It's called a HomeStar.

15:41.331 --> 15:43.565
- A server, right?
- Correct.

15:43.567 --> 15:45.400
Now, it runs your home's networks.

15:45.402 --> 15:48.003
Well, I checked. The other
two victims had one as well.

15:48.005 --> 15:49.537
Which tell us what?

15:49.539 --> 15:51.406
How our killer
got information on the victims.

15:51.408 --> 15:53.508
By hacking the server,
he was able to gain access

15:53.510 --> 15:55.043
to their phones, their computers.

15:55.045 --> 15:56.911
Gave him the keys
to their personal lives.

15:56.913 --> 15:58.680
Exactly.

15:58.682 --> 16:02.017
Look, let's say we want
to get information about Eric.

16:02.019 --> 16:03.818
You know, learn his dark secrets.

16:03.820 --> 16:05.820
Not a chance.

16:05.822 --> 16:08.023
Got a security app on my phone, my vault.

16:08.509 --> 16:09.524
Really?

16:10.661 --> 16:12.246
Okay.

16:19.002 --> 16:22.003
"I'm E. Die-hard Mets fan.

16:22.005 --> 16:23.571
"Wiz in the kitchen.

16:23.573 --> 16:26.875
Good listener. Sundays are fun days."

16:26.877 --> 16:29.611
Swipe left.

16:29.613 --> 16:32.947
Profile's public. Anyone can see that.

16:32.949 --> 16:35.950
Okay, E.

16:35.952 --> 16:37.396
How about this?

16:40.557 --> 16:42.485
Security cameras inside your house.

16:44.779 --> 16:48.763
Oh. That's deeply disturbing.

16:48.765 --> 16:50.865
And I was able to do that
in mere seconds.

16:50.867 --> 16:53.802
Get me a sophisticated
metadata, I can get a lot more.

16:53.804 --> 16:56.638
- How much more?
- Texts, emails.

16:56.640 --> 16:58.807
Look, it's as simple as a Google search.

16:58.809 --> 17:00.642
Type a key phrase into the search bar

17:00.644 --> 17:02.262
of a sophisticated program...

17:02.264 --> 17:06.815
"hate," "affair," "kill you"...
you're gonna get hits.

17:06.817 --> 17:09.651
Like profiling, he knows
the key words to search,

17:09.653 --> 17:11.486
the precursors to the fights.

17:11.488 --> 17:13.722
Wait for the moment their
fight's about to boil over.

17:13.723 --> 17:15.723
That's when he strikes.

17:17.894 --> 17:19.728
Sellitto.

17:19.730 --> 17:24.026
So the guy has to have left
some kind of digital footprint.

17:24.501 --> 17:27.989
With the search tools we have
now, no footprint at all.

17:28.571 --> 17:31.406
Look, if this guy's as good
as I think he is,

17:31.408 --> 17:33.327
we're not catching him online.

17:33.744 --> 17:35.009
He's a ghost.

17:35.011 --> 17:38.747
Thanks. Sorry to pile on with bad news,

17:38.749 --> 17:41.416
but it looks like
our killer struck again.

17:41.418 --> 17:45.687
Wife dead. No defensive wounds.
Husband in custody.

17:45.689 --> 17:47.925
This killer thinks he's invisible.

17:48.458 --> 17:51.926
But every move, every step, every breath,

17:51.928 --> 17:54.307
he makes himself visible to us.

17:54.865 --> 17:56.559
So let's find him.

17:57.033 --> 17:59.100
Victim is Samantha Layton, 33.

17:59.102 --> 18:02.604
- Multiple stab wounds.
- Taser?

18:02.606 --> 18:03.872
Told the M.E. on site to look.

18:03.874 --> 18:05.610
I'll confirm at the morgue.

18:06.042 --> 18:07.942
Well, what do we know
about their marriage?

18:07.944 --> 18:09.844
Well, they owned this
real estate business together,

18:09.846 --> 18:11.175
but it was failing.

18:11.177 --> 18:13.181
There's records
of arguments in emails, texts,

18:13.183 --> 18:15.884
and the office manager
heard them argue a lot.

18:15.886 --> 18:18.553
Husband's in custody
telling everyone he's innocent.

18:19.215 --> 18:20.481
And they have a HomeStar.

18:22.125 --> 18:23.658
We'll keep you updated
if we find any more info.

18:34.538 --> 18:37.475
House has been converted into an office.

18:39.409 --> 18:41.103
Show me the windows.

18:43.180 --> 18:45.914
There's a thin layer of dust on them.

18:45.916 --> 18:47.582
I don't think they've been opened.

18:47.902 --> 18:49.651
The killer got in somehow.

18:50.112 --> 18:51.906
What about the front door?

18:52.556 --> 18:54.116
Uh...

18:57.093 --> 18:59.594
No sign of forced entry.

19:01.898 --> 19:05.233
And the back door is
dead-bolted from the inside.

19:07.204 --> 19:09.771
Felix says all the victims'
security cameras were disabled

19:09.773 --> 19:13.261
at the time of the murder,
including the door cam.

19:13.677 --> 19:14.943
So you think the killer

19:14.945 --> 19:16.878
just walked in through the front door?

19:17.200 --> 19:18.499
Bring me the lock.

19:19.916 --> 19:21.749
If he did breach the lock,

19:21.751 --> 19:23.952
I want to see if he left us something.

19:24.188 --> 19:25.523
Hmm.

19:25.922 --> 19:27.121
Want to know how they got in?

19:27.942 --> 19:29.402
Yeah.

19:30.026 --> 19:32.280
See this plastic splinter?

19:33.263 --> 19:36.097
It's part of a 3-D printed key.

19:36.099 --> 19:38.800
Well, how did the perp get a key?

19:38.802 --> 19:40.635
I mean, I know they have digital access,

19:40.637 --> 19:43.037
but not actual access.

19:43.039 --> 19:45.273
If Felix was right,
all they would have to do

19:45.275 --> 19:47.141
is get the security images
of the front door

19:47.143 --> 19:49.110
from HomeStar, zoom in on the key

19:49.112 --> 19:51.646
when the targets came in,
take a screenshot,

19:51.648 --> 19:54.927
and then make a 3-D
printed key from that.

19:55.485 --> 19:57.972
I really need to upgrade
my home security system.

19:59.656 --> 20:00.989
Wow, so we were right.

20:00.991 --> 20:04.893
The killer just walked through
the front door.

20:04.895 --> 20:09.097
And that is why the timing
of the murders was so perfect.

20:09.099 --> 20:11.599
Because these couples had
a killer in their midst,

20:11.601 --> 20:13.167
and they didn't even know it.

20:30.450 --> 20:32.017
- How'd it go?
- Met with the DA.

20:32.019 --> 20:34.753
She's willing to wait
on a formal indictment,

20:34.755 --> 20:35.955
but if we don't prove this theory,

20:35.957 --> 20:38.057
they're gonna hit Raj with murder one.

20:38.059 --> 20:40.726
- Are they still holding him?
- They have 72 hours.

20:40.728 --> 20:43.229
- How's he doing?
- Last I talked to him,

20:43.231 --> 20:47.099
he was trying to hold
on to hope... but losing.

20:47.101 --> 20:50.469
- Mm.
- Well, I've got his back.

20:50.471 --> 20:52.404
I was able to get a partial
print from the key fragment.

20:52.406 --> 20:55.474
Not enough to run,
but if we land a suspect,

20:55.476 --> 20:56.795
I'll be able to match it.

20:56.797 --> 20:58.444
Okay, got something.

20:58.446 --> 21:02.214
I did a deep dive on the
electrical van Dave Chen saw.

21:02.216 --> 21:03.983
Now, it could be nothing,
but it could be a cover

21:03.985 --> 21:05.492
for the killer to be in the neighborhood.

21:05.494 --> 21:07.484
There were no photos of it
at the other crime scenes,

21:07.486 --> 21:09.488
but there was a security camera
across the street

21:09.490 --> 21:10.990
from the second victim's house.

21:10.992 --> 21:12.558
Tracked it down.

21:12.560 --> 21:13.964
We got this.

21:15.062 --> 21:16.467
Check out the lettering.

21:17.131 --> 21:19.565
- E-L-E?
- If that says electrical,

21:19.567 --> 21:22.334
that places the same van
at two crime scenes.

21:22.336 --> 21:23.969
Right, but we don't even know

21:23.971 --> 21:25.571
if it's a real electrical van or a cover.

21:25.573 --> 21:27.573
Oh, and that's why I pulled
all registered

21:27.575 --> 21:30.476
commercial electrical vans
in the tri-state area.

21:30.478 --> 21:32.444
Thousands.

21:32.446 --> 21:34.110
But...

21:35.950 --> 21:38.584
maybe there's a way
we can narrow it down.

21:38.586 --> 21:41.120
Dave Chen said the van
was idling the entire time

21:41.122 --> 21:42.421
he was outside Kamala's house.

21:42.423 --> 21:44.023
It was cold that night.

21:44.025 --> 21:45.791
He was probably running the heater,

21:45.793 --> 21:48.861
which means it was likely
releasing some kind of fluids.

21:48.863 --> 21:51.330
You think we can get a trace from the van

21:51.332 --> 21:53.800
in a city full of cars leaking fluid?

21:53.800 --> 21:54.966
I think it rained right before.

21:54.968 --> 21:56.667
I think that narrows the odds.

21:56.669 --> 21:58.169
If Sellitto and Eric can find out

21:58.171 --> 22:01.672
exactly where Chen thinks
it was parked, we can try.

22:01.674 --> 22:04.342
So we're looking for a needle
in an asphalt haystack.

22:04.344 --> 22:06.677
Mm, no more unlikely
than the parking ticket

22:06.679 --> 22:07.845
that nailed Son of Sam

22:07.847 --> 22:11.816
or Ted Bundy being pulled over
for driving a stolen car.

22:11.818 --> 22:15.526
Every scrap of evidence
leads back to someone.

22:54.494 --> 22:56.984
- Danielle?
- You need to come home.

22:57.230 --> 22:59.230
Why? What's wrong?

22:59.904 --> 23:01.766
I just need you to come home now.

23:01.768 --> 23:05.117
Okay. I'll be right there.

23:47.380 --> 23:49.247
Eric and Sellitto brought me asphalt

23:49.249 --> 23:50.481
from where the van was parked.

23:50.483 --> 23:52.083
You can get something from it?

23:52.085 --> 23:54.041
It's called a poultice.

23:54.454 --> 23:58.089
Lay it on top of any granite,
marble, or asphalt surface,

23:58.091 --> 24:00.214
pulls all the oil out.

24:00.493 --> 24:02.591
Makes for a great homemade cleaner.

24:04.803 --> 24:05.836
You good?

24:07.800 --> 24:11.168
I guess I'm still shocked at
Lincoln's emotional involvement

24:11.170 --> 24:12.559
in this case.

24:15.909 --> 24:17.008
I feel for him.

24:19.412 --> 24:21.178
He doesn't look like he cares
all the time.

24:21.180 --> 24:24.782
But here's a little secret
about Lincoln Rhyme.

24:25.406 --> 24:28.119
He cares all the time.

24:36.796 --> 24:37.995
Please tell me they found

24:37.997 --> 24:39.463
more than just potholes out there.

24:39.465 --> 24:41.832
The poultice pulled out
the oil from the asphalt

24:41.834 --> 24:43.200
with a high concentration of zinc

24:43.202 --> 24:45.134
dialkyl dithiophosphate.

24:45.972 --> 24:48.973
An additive used to prevent
engine wear in older cars.

24:48.975 --> 24:51.275
Which tells us that the van
is at least six years old.

24:51.277 --> 24:52.825
So that narrows the list.

24:52.827 --> 24:56.847
But get this, that particular
additive, it's an off-brand.

24:56.849 --> 24:59.183
It's only sold at two repair
shops in the five boroughs.

24:59.185 --> 25:00.851
I ran receipts from the last year,

25:00.853 --> 25:02.320
narrowed the listing further.

25:02.322 --> 25:05.356
- By how many?
- Two electrical vans.

25:05.358 --> 25:07.391
And one was a van from Elmwood Electric.

25:07.393 --> 25:08.559
So the company went out of business.

25:08.561 --> 25:10.161
They sold up their fleet at an auction.

25:10.163 --> 25:12.229
I got list of the customers,
ran the names,

25:12.231 --> 25:14.398
got a hit on a guy in the system

25:14.400 --> 25:18.002
for a hacking charge.
Ran the prints. Guess what.

25:18.375 --> 25:20.471
Matched our partial prints.

25:22.008 --> 25:24.308
Garrett Harrison.
Tech support at HomeStar.

25:24.310 --> 25:26.978
- Eric's putting a BOLO out.
- He was fired ten months ago.

25:26.980 --> 25:29.981
- Fired why?
- Interpersonal conflict.

25:29.983 --> 25:33.017
I dug into his background
and found the real kicker.

25:33.019 --> 25:34.986
When he was a teenager,
his father killed his mother

25:34.988 --> 25:37.355
right in front of him
after one too many fights.

25:37.357 --> 25:39.857
Father went on trial, beat the rap,

25:39.859 --> 25:41.525
destroyed the family.

25:41.527 --> 25:43.394
Well, at least now

25:43.396 --> 25:45.863
we know why he targets fighting couples.

25:45.865 --> 25:48.265
He's acting out what he saw
his parents do.

25:48.267 --> 25:50.067
This happened when he was a teenager.

25:50.069 --> 25:52.036
Why has he suddenly started killing?

25:52.038 --> 25:53.871
Anything could have triggered
him, really.

25:53.873 --> 25:56.207
I've got his address, but be careful.

25:56.209 --> 25:57.375
He's ahead of us.

25:57.377 --> 25:59.076
You're right, Felix.

25:59.078 --> 26:01.627
Which is why I want you to go with them.

26:02.915 --> 26:06.465
Right. Yeah, I... I can do that.

26:26.973 --> 26:30.541
Okay, on three. One. Two.

26:30.543 --> 26:32.643
Wait. I'm getting a Z-Wave signal

26:32.645 --> 26:34.545
coming from inside the unit.

26:34.547 --> 26:36.580
- What?
- Meaning Garrett's running

26:36.582 --> 26:38.916
a smart lock on the door itself.

26:38.918 --> 26:40.618
He can control it from anywhere.

26:40.620 --> 26:42.486
Yeah, but we're gonna bypass
that the old-fashioned way.

26:42.488 --> 26:45.056
Which would trigger an alarm.

26:45.058 --> 26:46.590
He could remotely erase
the hard drive before

26:46.592 --> 26:48.590
we have a chance to look at it.

26:49.495 --> 26:51.996
I can bypass it the new way.

26:51.998 --> 26:53.064
Okay.

26:57.303 --> 26:59.937
NYPD!

27:02.175 --> 27:03.480
Clear.

27:14.087 --> 27:16.253
- Clear.
- First floor's clear.

27:16.255 --> 27:17.321
Check in the basement.

27:25.131 --> 27:27.298
Are you gambling again?

27:27.300 --> 27:29.133
You promised that you'd stop.

27:29.135 --> 27:32.470
Basement's clear. Look at this setup.

27:32.472 --> 27:34.438
Lincoln, are you seeing this?

27:34.440 --> 27:37.675
He's got multiple camera angles
from inside their house.

27:38.805 --> 27:40.611
You lost all of it.

27:41.226 --> 27:44.515
Looks like we just found his next target.

27:47.531 --> 27:49.268
Their entire house is run
through a HomeStar.

27:49.293 --> 27:51.193
Security cameras.

27:51.195 --> 27:53.195
He's been watching for weeks.

27:53.197 --> 27:54.864
Yeah, this guy's sick.

27:54.866 --> 27:56.492
Continue playing that video.

27:58.136 --> 28:01.003
You lost all of it?

28:01.005 --> 28:02.271
I won't do it again.

28:02.273 --> 28:04.039
I promise.

28:04.041 --> 28:06.275
We never should have bought this house.

28:06.277 --> 28:09.542
We can't pay our bills.
We can't pay our mortgage.

28:09.567 --> 28:11.089
I could kill you.

28:11.525 --> 28:13.425
"I could kill you"?

28:13.985 --> 28:16.652
Sounds like the kind of fight
that would trigger him.

28:16.654 --> 28:18.053
Yeah, for all we know,
he could be there now.

28:18.055 --> 28:19.889
We need names, address, phone numbers.

28:19.891 --> 28:21.824
- We've got to warn them.
- On it.

28:25.395 --> 28:26.729
What just happened?

28:26.731 --> 28:29.704
He wrote a self-destruct code
to prevent unauthorized logins.

28:29.705 --> 28:31.838
I can beat him. It's gonna take time.

28:31.840 --> 28:32.939
There might be another way.

28:32.941 --> 28:34.441
What are you thinking?

28:34.905 --> 28:36.448
Rewind.

28:37.112 --> 28:38.408
Stop.

28:38.947 --> 28:41.114
The style looks to be Medieval Revival,

28:41.116 --> 28:42.883
pointed arch windows, chandelier,

28:42.885 --> 28:45.952
all original and meticulously maintained.

28:45.954 --> 28:47.715
It could be an historic home.

28:47.717 --> 28:50.087
Zoom in on the husband's shirt.

28:51.260 --> 28:54.194
It's an emblem for the Bronx
Museum of Natural History.

28:54.196 --> 28:56.963
He could live somewhere
in the vicinity of the Bronx.

28:56.965 --> 29:00.055
There are a handful of historic
districts in the Bronx.

29:01.637 --> 29:02.808
Wait.

29:04.573 --> 29:06.478
Enlarge the right side of the frame.

29:07.776 --> 29:10.357
The book on the coffee table, zoom in.

29:11.146 --> 29:13.213
It's a book on Dwight James Baum,

29:13.215 --> 29:16.149
noted architect
of the early 20th century.

29:16.151 --> 29:17.784
He did most of his work in the Bronx,

29:17.786 --> 29:19.486
where he built half the homes

29:19.488 --> 29:22.656
in what would become the
Fieldston Historic District.

29:22.658 --> 29:24.658
Can you narrow it down a little more?

29:24.660 --> 29:28.095
It's a small area, about 250 homes.

29:28.097 --> 29:30.297
But they were arguing that
they shouldn't have bought it.

29:30.544 --> 29:32.165
I'll check recent real estate
listings to see

29:32.167 --> 29:33.640
if I can match the interior.

29:33.642 --> 29:34.948
Give me a minute.

29:34.950 --> 29:36.903
We'll head there now to see
if we can spot the van.

29:36.905 --> 29:37.938
I'm gonna stay here and see if I can

29:37.940 --> 29:39.072
get this back up and running.

29:39.074 --> 29:40.807
I'll let the unis know.

29:44.102 --> 29:45.222
I got it!

29:45.247 --> 29:47.647
4400 Waldo Avenue.

29:47.649 --> 29:49.850
The house is listed under
Richard and Michaela Garfield.

29:49.852 --> 29:51.315
Let's go.

29:53.255 --> 29:55.068
ESU is five minutes out.

29:55.524 --> 29:57.696
Electrical van's been spotted outside.

29:58.193 --> 30:01.325
Exigent circumstances if ever I saw it.

30:02.631 --> 30:06.099
Lincoln, we're going in.

30:06.101 --> 30:07.539
Door's unlocked.

30:23.218 --> 30:24.684
Hands up. NYPD.

30:24.686 --> 30:26.853
- What's happening?
- Richard Garfield?

30:26.855 --> 30:29.656
There's an intruder in your house.
Is your wife home?

30:29.658 --> 30:31.558
- Oh God, Michaela.
- We'll get her.

30:31.560 --> 30:32.859
I need you to wait outside, Richard.

30:32.861 --> 30:34.561
- But my wife.
- We will find her.

30:34.563 --> 30:36.526
I need you outside.

30:38.667 --> 30:41.802
Husband's secure. Wife's in the house.

30:45.040 --> 30:46.339
Felix says, with his set up gear,

30:46.341 --> 30:48.074
he can watch you from his phone.

30:48.413 --> 30:50.043
I want you all to move carefully.

30:50.045 --> 30:51.678
Take care of each other.

30:51.680 --> 30:54.748
Yeah. I like the sound of that.

30:55.712 --> 30:56.963
Okay.

30:57.920 --> 31:00.353
I'm gonna move room to room

31:00.355 --> 31:05.192
until we... Lincoln?

31:05.194 --> 31:07.093
He's controlling the lights.

31:11.333 --> 31:13.600
It's pitch black in here, Lincoln.

31:13.602 --> 31:15.902
Felix engineered your rig
with night vision.

31:15.904 --> 31:17.037
I'll help guide you.

31:17.039 --> 31:19.105
Night vision mode.

31:21.076 --> 31:22.906
I still can't see.

31:23.378 --> 31:24.878
You can do this, Amelia.

31:36.892 --> 31:39.226
There's a hallway
in front of you with a door.

31:52.975 --> 31:55.208
NYPD. You're gonna be okay.

31:59.715 --> 32:01.314
I need paramedics.

32:01.316 --> 32:03.884
Got female victim, stabbed in the chest.

32:03.886 --> 32:08.088
Okay. Hang on. I'm getting you help.

32:30.078 --> 32:32.434
She needs to hear your voice.

32:34.917 --> 32:36.688
You're doing great, Amelia.

32:36.985 --> 32:38.351
One step at a time.

32:38.353 --> 32:39.786
I'm right here with you.

32:39.788 --> 32:42.194
Breath. Just breath.

32:48.182 --> 32:49.181
There's a door ahead.

32:50.618 --> 32:52.245
It's slightly ajar.

33:07.282 --> 33:09.215
I'm checking the basement.

33:09.217 --> 33:11.017
Ambo's here.

33:11.019 --> 33:13.391
ESU is two minutes out.
I'm checking the perimeter.

33:25.133 --> 33:28.835
- What is this?
- Some sort of storage base.

33:28.837 --> 33:30.742
Who are these people?

33:41.316 --> 33:42.816
Stop.

33:42.818 --> 33:45.752
Amelia, be still.

33:45.754 --> 33:47.467
Don't say a word.

33:48.056 --> 33:50.470
At 5:00 is a man hiding.

33:51.159 --> 33:53.515
Now, we don't know what he can see.

33:53.929 --> 33:56.896
Eric, get down there.
Felix, get those lights on.

33:58.266 --> 34:00.266
I know you're there.

34:02.104 --> 34:03.400
Garrett?

34:04.873 --> 34:06.873
We know who you are.

34:06.875 --> 34:08.530
We know what you've been through.

34:09.277 --> 34:12.826
We know everything.

34:13.949 --> 34:15.911
I know you've been hurt,

34:16.918 --> 34:19.518
and I know you want to hurt people back.

34:19.521 --> 34:21.626
You think you can talk me down?

34:22.891 --> 34:26.592
Lead me to some sort
of breakthrough, hmm?

34:26.594 --> 34:29.062
I want you to know that I get it.

34:29.063 --> 34:30.594
Look, I can help you.

34:32.934 --> 34:35.601
You know you're not walking out of here.

34:35.603 --> 34:38.893
So it's up to you
how this plays out, okay?

34:39.408 --> 34:41.980
This can end easily...

34:44.440 --> 34:46.212
Or the hard way.

34:48.250 --> 34:49.983
All you have to do is...

34:49.985 --> 34:51.551
Ugh!

34:51.553 --> 34:52.819
Amelia!

34:53.324 --> 34:54.920
Amelia.

34:58.181 --> 35:00.182
Amelia, talk to me.

35:00.184 --> 35:02.097
Felix, we need those lights.

35:02.142 --> 35:03.175
Just a few more seconds.

35:03.177 --> 35:04.843
We don't have a few more seconds.

35:34.541 --> 35:37.494
- Amelia.
- Yeah.

35:45.853 --> 35:47.085
Tell me you're okay.

35:47.606 --> 35:49.072
I'm good.

35:51.025 --> 35:52.858
Someone should call Lincoln.

35:57.197 --> 35:59.665
Suspect in custody.

35:59.667 --> 36:02.768
Okay. What was the gunshot?

36:02.770 --> 36:06.204
Me firing at shadows.

36:06.693 --> 36:08.260
And hitting them.

36:09.484 --> 36:11.176
She got him.

36:11.178 --> 36:12.737
Yes, she did.

36:13.881 --> 36:16.014
Great job, Amelia.

36:24.191 --> 36:26.558
He's stable. Medic thinks it was

36:26.560 --> 36:29.504
a through-and-through and
didn't hit any major arteries.

36:30.097 --> 36:32.631
Not bad for a blind shot.

36:32.633 --> 36:34.700
Well, I wasn't blind.

36:34.702 --> 36:35.901
I had Lincoln.

36:38.272 --> 36:40.765
He was my eyes for a change.

36:41.875 --> 36:43.909
- What about Michaela?
- She's on her way to surgery,

36:43.911 --> 36:46.078
but they say she's gonna be okay.

36:46.080 --> 36:48.440
We must have stopped him when we came in.

36:49.216 --> 36:51.817
Felix is working the apartment.
He thinks he found the trigger.

36:51.819 --> 36:53.719
Garrett's neighbor said
he had a girlfriend.

36:53.721 --> 36:56.254
They had a huge fight. She ghosted him.

36:56.256 --> 37:00.158
Let me guess. This was six months ago

37:00.160 --> 37:02.829
right before the first murder.

37:03.230 --> 37:05.931
You know, Amelia, you really
should go to the hospital,

37:05.933 --> 37:07.542
make sure you're okay.

37:08.969 --> 37:10.587
I'm okay.

37:11.238 --> 37:12.881
Thank you.

37:14.308 --> 37:15.907
I, uh,

37:16.301 --> 37:17.909
I have somewhere else I need to be.

37:17.911 --> 37:19.345
Mm.

37:23.150 --> 37:26.644
- They're letting me go?
- By morning.

37:27.254 --> 37:29.821
They're dropping the charges, Raj.

37:30.991 --> 37:32.424
Same with the others.

37:38.032 --> 37:40.165
Thank you, Lincoln.

37:40.167 --> 37:42.367
You saved Raj's life.

37:42.369 --> 37:44.336
It won't bring Kamala back.

37:44.338 --> 37:47.706
No, but at least he has a chance to heal.

37:47.708 --> 37:49.041
Mm.

37:49.043 --> 37:50.710
Now we all can.

37:51.345 --> 37:53.630
I talked to Kamala's mother.

37:54.348 --> 37:56.148
Her funeral is this Sunday
in New Hampshire.

37:56.150 --> 37:58.051
I'm gonna fly out for it.

37:58.619 --> 38:00.053
I'd like to be there.

38:00.954 --> 38:02.680
And I'd like to see you.

38:05.059 --> 38:09.027
But I know you're...

38:09.029 --> 38:10.462
busy.

38:14.134 --> 38:16.361
We're getting closer
to the Bone Collector,

38:17.137 --> 38:19.948
hunting old cases, taking a new approach.

38:21.141 --> 38:23.243
I'm gonna find him this time, Naia.

38:23.877 --> 38:25.954
Put that fear to rest once and for all.

38:26.680 --> 38:29.707
I hope so... for all of us.

38:32.753 --> 38:34.420
Tell Camden I love him.

38:35.422 --> 38:36.721
I will.

38:51.338 --> 38:52.772
Come in.

38:55.175 --> 38:56.408
You have a visitor.

38:56.410 --> 38:58.027
Oh.

38:58.345 --> 39:00.378
Don't you think you've earned
a good night's sleep?

39:00.380 --> 39:02.781
Ahh, I earned more than that.

39:02.783 --> 39:04.082
Mm.

39:04.084 --> 39:06.751
But I seem to remember
you making a promise

39:06.753 --> 39:08.872
to find the Bone Collector,

39:09.423 --> 39:12.524
and the Barry Rotko boxes have arrived.

39:14.761 --> 39:17.896
Unless, you know, you're too tired.

39:20.033 --> 39:22.033
Claire, put on some coffee?

39:22.035 --> 39:24.888
One coffee and one
green smoothie coming up.

39:27.153 --> 39:28.558
I'd like to thank you.

39:31.197 --> 39:32.697
No need.

39:35.227 --> 39:36.774
We did it for you.

39:41.321 --> 39:42.864
Should we get started?

39:43.957 --> 39:45.867
Let's find the Bone Collector.

40:02.476 --> 40:03.885
Hey.

40:11.852 --> 40:13.394
Everything okay?

40:15.122 --> 40:16.188
We need to talk.

40:19.426 --> 40:23.428
I found these today.
They were hidden in the wall.

40:23.430 --> 40:25.657
I couldn't even look at them all.

40:32.005 --> 40:33.539
These are awful.

40:34.274 --> 40:36.376
I'm shaking.

40:36.944 --> 40:38.920
I think these are real.

40:39.186 --> 40:42.855
I think someone who lived here
before us might be...

40:42.950 --> 40:44.467
A killer.

40:45.185 --> 40:47.595
We should call the police.

40:48.288 --> 40:51.856
Yes. Yes. I'll call 911.

40:51.858 --> 40:55.460
No, 911 is for imminent danger.

40:55.462 --> 40:58.296
We'll... we'll call first thing tomorrow.

40:58.940 --> 41:01.199
- Tomorrow?
- It'll wait.

41:01.201 --> 41:04.734
No, honey, this is bad.

41:04.736 --> 41:06.838
And this guy could still be out there.

41:06.840 --> 41:11.476
I think... I mean, some of these
pictures... like, this is...

41:11.478 --> 41:13.345
Jane.

41:39.006 --> 41:40.648
Come with me.

41:41.541 --> 41:42.574
Trust me.

41:45.178 --> 41:47.447
It'll all be okay.
