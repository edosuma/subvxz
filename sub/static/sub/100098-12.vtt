00:01.200 --> 00:04.200
What if I told you we could
make it like none of this ever happened?

00:04.520 --> 00:06.955
What would you be willing
to sacrifice for that?

00:07.240 --> 00:09.357
<i>You wanna know
what I believe?</i>

00:09.760 --> 00:11.160
That this isn't the end.

00:11.280 --> 00:13.670
That there's another world
out there for both of us.

00:14.880 --> 00:16.633
<i>And we'll see
each other again.</i>

00:16.720 --> 00:19.440
You think Angela's dead,
but she's not.

00:19.520 --> 00:21.637
<i>Elliot, I can't wait
to marry you tomorrow.</i>

00:22.000 --> 00:25.198
<i>You can reset everything and
live in the world you deserve.</i>

00:25.280 --> 00:26.555
<i>A world without your past...</i>

00:26.640 --> 00:29.951
Do you recall a time
your father ever hurt you?

00:30.040 --> 00:31.076
Yes.

00:31.160 --> 00:33.311
<i>Without all the pain
you carry...</i>

00:33.400 --> 00:35.056
Just finishing up a call.
Be out in a jiff.

00:35.080 --> 00:36.355
<i>Without your regrets...</i>

00:36.440 --> 00:39.638
<i>From the Mixed-Up Files
of Basil E. Frankweiler.</i>

00:39.720 --> 00:43.350
Your parents in town yet?
Hello, Emily? You there?

00:43.480 --> 00:46.552
<i>A 5.9-magnitude tremor
struck Washington Township.</i>

00:46.640 --> 00:48.552
I've imagined
what it would be like

00:48.640 --> 00:51.872
<i>to be someone with
a more exciting life.</i>

00:52.440 --> 00:53.556
Will you believe with me?

01:01.360 --> 01:02.360
Who are you?

01:03.640 --> 01:05.438
Can you tell me what happened
to that house?

01:05.519 --> 01:07.352
Can you tell me
what's your monster?

01:12.760 --> 01:15.753
<i>It's Mom. She's gone.
She was an asshole to us.</i>

01:16.200 --> 01:18.120
<i>I need to go back
to Washington Township.</i>

01:20.160 --> 01:22.720
But soon you will see.
We will be reborn as new.

01:23.040 --> 01:24.360
This place is gonna blow!

01:24.480 --> 01:27.473
If we don't stop this, the meltdown
will destroy the whole town.

01:31.080 --> 01:32.080
Did it work?

01:42.880 --> 01:44.109
<i>Hello, friend.</i>

01:44.880 --> 01:46.234
<i>Hello, friend.</i>

01:47.840 --> 01:49.559
<i>Wait, you can hear me again?</i>

01:51.000 --> 01:52.798
<i>Have you been there
this whole time?</i>

01:53.360 --> 01:56.432
<i>I was so focused on the hack that
I guess I thought you were gone.</i>

01:57.480 --> 02:01.110
<i>But after whatjust happened at the plant,
I thought for sure I was gone too.</i>

02:02.080 --> 02:03.230
<i>We're dead, right?</i>

02:03.960 --> 02:05.440
<i>There's no way we survived.</i>

02:07.320 --> 02:08.959
<i>But if we're dead,</i>

02:09.680 --> 02:11.273
<i>then how am I talking to you?</i>

02:12.440 --> 02:13.476
<i>And if you're here...</i>

02:15.080 --> 02:16.355
<i>Where's Mr. Robot?</i>

02:40.920 --> 02:42.195
<i>What was that?</i>

02:42.560 --> 02:44.199
<i>You felt that too, right?</i>

02:44.560 --> 02:45.960
<i>It was like an earthquake.</i>

02:47.640 --> 02:48.676
<i>Wait.</i>

02:50.240 --> 02:51.515
<i>I'm not dead.</i>

02:52.680 --> 02:53.875
<i>I'm alive.</i>

02:55.000 --> 02:58.880
<i>Which means
you are too, right?</i>

03:00.960 --> 03:02.235
<i>Where are we?</i>

03:14.320 --> 03:15.549
<i>Yeah.</i>

03:15.640 --> 03:16.915
<i>I'm thinking the same thing.</i>

03:17.520 --> 03:20.115
<i>This looks exactly like
where the power plant was,</i>

03:20.200 --> 03:21.554
<i>except...</i>

03:24.800 --> 03:25.800
<i>It's not.</i>

03:31.160 --> 03:33.038
<i>I know what you're thinking,
but don't.</i>

03:33.640 --> 03:35.074
<i>That's impossible.</i>

03:35.640 --> 03:38.030
<i>Whiterose is out of her
fucking mind.</i>

03:38.480 --> 03:40.437
<i>Yeah, yeah, I know. So am I.</i>

03:41.600 --> 03:44.672
<i>But still, there's no way
her machine worked,</i>

03:45.160 --> 03:46.310
<i>right?</i>

05:41.960 --> 05:43.110
<i>It can't be.</i>

05:48.520 --> 05:49.749
<i>How?</i>

05:50.200 --> 05:52.715
<i>It's been gone for 20 years,
ever since...</i>

05:54.640 --> 05:55.710
<i>He died.</i>

06:51.440 --> 06:53.440
Just finishing up a call.
Be out in a jiff.

06:57.840 --> 06:59.354
<i>Tell me you heard that too.</i>

07:04.880 --> 07:06.678
<i>Can this really be happening?</i>

07:13.760 --> 07:14.796
<i>Is it...</i>

07:16.760 --> 07:17.760
<i>Is it really...</i>

07:20.360 --> 07:21.396
<i>him?</i>

07:29.560 --> 07:31.870
I got a customer.
We still on for lunch?

07:35.160 --> 07:36.160
Okay.

07:39.520 --> 07:40.520
See you soon.

07:43.880 --> 07:44.950
Yeah.

07:47.640 --> 07:48.756
No problem.

07:49.480 --> 07:50.800
I'm always here for you.

07:55.440 --> 07:57.318
<i>My monster
is still alive.</i>

07:59.800 --> 08:01.240
Sorry for the wait.

08:01.840 --> 08:02.956
How can I help you?

08:05.880 --> 08:07.030
Hmm.

08:09.480 --> 08:10.516
There you are.

08:11.640 --> 08:12.994
Ah.

08:13.360 --> 08:14.360
Hmm.

08:59.600 --> 09:00.600
Hey.

09:22.400 --> 09:24.119
Hey!

09:24.200 --> 09:26.317
Hi, honey!
How was your day?

09:27.120 --> 09:28.236
Dad's home!

09:30.160 --> 09:31.640
<i>This is
my old neighborhood.</i>

09:33.120 --> 09:36.511
<i>That's my old house,
but who's in there?</i>

09:38.120 --> 09:40.032
<i>Who's he talking to?</i>

09:40.440 --> 09:41.715
Yo...

09:41.800 --> 09:44.031
- Can I ask you a question?
- Hey, Elliot.

09:45.840 --> 09:47.160
You know who I am?

09:47.240 --> 09:48.833
Duh, you live
right there.

09:50.080 --> 09:51.150
Where have you been?

09:52.080 --> 09:53.560
I haven't seen you
in a while.

09:54.720 --> 09:55.995
You look different.

09:57.360 --> 09:59.296
Okay, okay. I'll pick it up
when I get to the city.

09:59.320 --> 10:00.760
Back before dinner!

10:16.280 --> 10:17.839
Your nose is bleeding.

10:22.240 --> 10:24.630
<i>If she knows who I am,
maybe she knows.</i>

10:24.720 --> 10:26.154
I need your help.

10:27.080 --> 10:29.834
I'm looking for Darlene.
Do you know where she is?

10:31.520 --> 10:32.556
Who's Darlene?

10:33.600 --> 10:34.750
My sister.

10:38.800 --> 10:39.870
What's so funny?

10:41.360 --> 10:42.794
You don't have a sister.

10:45.160 --> 10:46.160
Elliot?

10:49.200 --> 10:51.715
I wasn't expecting
to see you until tomorrow.

10:51.800 --> 10:54.599
Hi, Mrs. Alderson.
Bye, Mrs. Alderson.

11:03.760 --> 11:07.549
Well, why are you still standing across
the street there looking at me?

11:09.080 --> 11:10.833
Stop being funny
and come over here.

11:20.960 --> 11:23.759
You just missed your father.
He went up to the city.

11:26.080 --> 11:27.309
Let me look at you.

11:35.000 --> 11:36.150
Have you lost weight?

11:37.360 --> 11:38.760
You're too skinny.

11:39.880 --> 11:42.111
Come on, let's scrounge
some lunch up for you.

11:46.480 --> 11:48.551
I can't wait to show
you the new curtains.

11:48.840 --> 11:50.399
I know, I know,
you don't care,

11:50.520 --> 11:53.479
but trust me on this,
you'll notice the difference.

12:08.800 --> 12:10.359
This does
look different.

12:11.240 --> 12:12.469
Told you!

12:14.080 --> 12:16.595
Only took me 30 years
to get around to it.

12:17.080 --> 12:20.835
When I saw them,
I knew I had to have them.

12:20.920 --> 12:22.115
Hmm.

12:22.760 --> 12:26.151
Crazy how one small change can make
an entire place feel new.

12:46.000 --> 12:51.678
Okay, so I can make you one of
my special delicious sandwiches.

12:52.360 --> 12:54.431
Do you want
turkey or ham?

13:06.040 --> 13:07.315
No Darlene.

13:09.800 --> 13:11.075
Who's Darlene?

13:19.440 --> 13:22.160
Anyway, I thought
you had a presentation today,

13:22.480 --> 13:25.040
or was that yesterday?
How'd it go?

13:26.000 --> 13:27.354
I'm not sure.

13:28.080 --> 13:30.390
You've always
been your own harshest critic.

13:31.880 --> 13:33.200
I'm sure
you did great.

13:37.320 --> 13:39.277
<i>This doesn't
sound like my mom.</i>

13:39.680 --> 13:42.149
<i>This sounds like someone
who loves their son.</i>

13:43.680 --> 13:45.273
<i>Everything's changed.</i>

13:48.080 --> 13:49.275
<i>Even...</i>

13:49.840 --> 13:50.840
Me.

13:51.320 --> 13:53.835
What was that, honey?
You what?

13:57.880 --> 13:59.837
<i>If their past has changed...</i>

14:07.320 --> 14:08.390
<i>Has mine?</i>

14:10.280 --> 14:11.714
<i>Does that mean...</i>

14:13.720 --> 14:14.720
The window.

14:16.120 --> 14:17.270
What window?

14:37.880 --> 14:38.880
Elliot?

14:40.200 --> 14:41.600
What's gotten into you?

14:42.080 --> 14:43.116
Where's my bedroom?

14:45.720 --> 14:46.836
It was right here.

14:47.920 --> 14:49.991
- Are you all right?
- My bedroom.

14:50.960 --> 14:51.960
Where is it?

14:54.160 --> 14:55.435
Where it's always been.

15:33.640 --> 15:34.640
No.

15:37.120 --> 15:38.474
This can't be true.

15:39.680 --> 15:41.194
What can't be true?

15:47.000 --> 15:48.673
When I was eight years old,

15:49.280 --> 15:52.193
do you remember me
having an accident?

15:53.280 --> 15:54.714
What accident?

15:55.200 --> 15:56.714
When I broke my arm.

15:57.640 --> 16:00.155
Honey, you've never
broken your arm.

16:00.600 --> 16:03.513
You've never broken a bone
in your entire life.

16:06.440 --> 16:07.794
Elliot...

16:14.680 --> 16:16.433
I'm worried
about you.

16:18.880 --> 16:20.314
Why don't
we sit down?

16:29.480 --> 16:30.755
<i>If I didn'tjump,</i>

16:31.640 --> 16:33.791
<i>does that mean
there was no reason to?</i>

16:34.760 --> 16:36.114
Mom...

16:38.840 --> 16:40.240
Just tell me.

16:43.120 --> 16:44.634
Did you ever hurt me?

16:52.320 --> 16:53.549
Did...

16:56.840 --> 16:58.035
Dad?

17:06.280 --> 17:07.555
Elliot...

17:09.079 --> 17:10.833
Your father and I

17:11.400 --> 17:14.711
would never,
ever hurt you.

17:19.280 --> 17:20.999
We love you...

17:22.160 --> 17:23.752
More than anything.

17:30.440 --> 17:32.033
Where's all this
coming from?

17:33.680 --> 17:35.512
Did something happen
between you and Angela?

17:38.000 --> 17:40.560
Is this about her parents?
I don't mean to overstep,

17:40.640 --> 17:42.711
but I know they've had
their ups and downs,

17:42.800 --> 17:44.336
and if you two think
you're gonna end up like...

17:44.360 --> 17:45.360
Angela?

17:47.720 --> 17:48.756
She's...

17:48.880 --> 17:49.916
<i>Alive?</i>

17:50.000 --> 17:54.438
It's totally normal to be nervous
before your big day tomorrow.

17:55.760 --> 17:56.760
My big day?

17:57.600 --> 18:02.834
I know the stress of a wedding
can be taxing for a couple...

18:02.920 --> 18:03.920
<i>Wedding?</i>

18:06.520 --> 18:08.000
<i>I'm marrying Angela?</i>

18:08.240 --> 18:09.240
Mom?

18:11.840 --> 18:13.433
Where is Angela right now?

18:16.760 --> 18:18.877
Unless she decided
to become a runaway bride,

18:18.960 --> 18:22.032
she must be back
in her apartment in the city.

18:29.840 --> 18:31.160
<i>What do you think?</i>

18:32.080 --> 18:33.639
<i>Do you buy any of this?</i>

18:35.040 --> 18:38.556
<i>We started out wanting to change
the world, but did it happen?</i>

18:39.800 --> 18:42.031
<i>Is this the world
I fought so hard for?</i>

18:43.040 --> 18:45.350
<i>A world free of all
the pain I went through?</i>

18:46.240 --> 18:48.835
<i>Am I actually considering
this could be real?</i>

18:57.360 --> 18:59.352
<i>No. I won't let myself.</i>

19:03.400 --> 19:04.595
<i>Not yet.</i>

19:06.080 --> 19:07.878
<i>Not until I see Angela.</i>

19:10.720 --> 19:11.995
<i>Then I'll know.</i>

19:32.480 --> 19:35.120
<i>If I see her, will this world
make more sense</i>

19:35.840 --> 19:37.035
<i>or less?</i>

19:38.840 --> 19:40.797
<i>I don't know,
but it's worth the risk.</i>

19:49.440 --> 19:51.033
Mr. Alderson.

19:52.920 --> 19:53.956
Oh.

19:54.040 --> 19:55.040
Scared, huh?

19:55.120 --> 19:56.520
Well, you should be.

19:56.920 --> 20:00.072
After all, as far as you're concerned,
I am evil incarnate.

20:01.600 --> 20:03.557
Phillip, stop giving him
such a hard time.

20:03.680 --> 20:05.433
Come on, Em,
he knows I'm only joshing him.

20:05.520 --> 20:09.275
Besides, if I'm to be his father-in-law,
he should be a little frightened of me.

20:09.360 --> 20:10.589
Sweetie, come on in.

20:12.120 --> 20:13.120
Come on.

20:19.520 --> 20:22.035
We came up a few days early
to help Angela out

20:22.120 --> 20:23.713
with a few last-minute
adjustments,

20:23.800 --> 20:27.510
but when we got here, as usual,
she's done everything herself,

20:27.600 --> 20:28.875
so we've got
nothing to do.

20:28.960 --> 20:32.590
Don't be fooled. She's bitter
about that, so tread carefully.

20:33.160 --> 20:37.200
She is amazing that way, isn't she?
She always has been, I guess.

20:37.320 --> 20:40.154
Oh, and wait until you see her in her dress.
- Mmm.

20:44.480 --> 20:45.709
Okay.

20:52.080 --> 20:54.640
Well, yes.

20:55.840 --> 20:57.194
Anyway,

20:57.400 --> 20:59.471
to what do we owe
the honor?

20:59.840 --> 21:01.399
Was Angela
expecting you?

21:04.040 --> 21:05.360
No. I...

21:10.920 --> 21:12.673
Just wanted to see her.

21:14.200 --> 21:15.270
Wow.

21:15.360 --> 21:18.876
You two really can't go a minute
without missing each other.

21:18.960 --> 21:20.314
So sweet.

21:20.440 --> 21:23.000
I remember that feeling,
I think.

21:24.840 --> 21:28.072
And that is usually my cue
to make everyone a drink.

21:30.600 --> 21:32.273
Uh, that won't
be necessary.

21:33.720 --> 21:35.313
I'm just trying
to find Angela.

21:35.400 --> 21:37.551
Well, she's meeting us
for lunch.

21:40.400 --> 21:42.551
- She is?
- Yes.

21:42.880 --> 21:45.634
We're trying that cute place
on the corner. You should come.

21:45.920 --> 21:48.037
Phillip, I want Elliot
to come along.

21:48.240 --> 21:50.391
Only after we've had
one of my whiskey sours.

21:51.120 --> 21:52.839
Only one.
I don't wanna be late.

21:55.960 --> 21:57.076
You know, Elliot,

21:58.240 --> 22:01.995
I am so happy to see the two of you
finally tie the knot.

22:02.800 --> 22:03.870
Watching you grow up,

22:03.960 --> 22:05.952
I always knew there was
something very special

22:06.040 --> 22:08.714
between the two of you,
but, frankly,

22:08.800 --> 22:10.393
I was worried
she wouldn't see it.

22:11.160 --> 22:14.312
Between us, she didn't always
have the best taste in men.

22:16.680 --> 22:18.000
Yeah, I know.

22:23.440 --> 22:25.557
But this is the start
of something new.

22:26.880 --> 22:27.950
Are you excited?

22:36.600 --> 22:38.239
Oh, shoot.

22:38.520 --> 22:40.159
That was meant
to be a surprise.

22:42.360 --> 22:44.158
We borrowed all of these
from your mother.

22:45.600 --> 22:47.637
Angela wanted to give
something to you,

22:48.360 --> 22:50.875
something that embodied
your whole story together.

22:50.960 --> 22:52.633
I think she did
a wonderful job.

22:53.480 --> 22:54.675
I just love...

22:55.280 --> 22:56.316
<i>These images...</i>

22:57.680 --> 22:58.955
<i>I've seen them before.</i>

23:00.160 --> 23:02.550
<i>I've pictured this fantasy
so many times.</i>

23:03.680 --> 23:06.479
<i>This is what normal people do
when they're happy, right?</i>

23:07.000 --> 23:09.435
<i>Get married, start a family,</i>

23:10.520 --> 23:12.830
<i>surround themselves
with people they love,</i>

23:13.840 --> 23:15.194
<i>with people that love them.</i>

23:15.320 --> 23:16.640
Trust me, Em,

23:17.200 --> 23:18.350
we got lucky.

23:19.240 --> 23:20.594
He's good, this one.

23:21.520 --> 23:23.113
True love prevails.

23:24.160 --> 23:28.074
Ever since he retired,
he has become quite the softy.

23:28.320 --> 23:30.630
You know, I know I'm not
supposed to say anything,

23:30.760 --> 23:33.116
but when your father came by
and showed us that gift

23:33.200 --> 23:34.873
that you got for her...

23:36.560 --> 23:38.040
She's gonna love it.

23:39.160 --> 23:41.720
Oh, don't worry.
It's just between us.

23:41.800 --> 23:43.029
I am a vault,

23:43.120 --> 23:47.034
and he cannot remember anything
past the last five minutes.

23:47.120 --> 23:48.713
Bottoms up!

23:53.080 --> 23:54.275
Mmm!

23:55.360 --> 23:57.955
We should get going. I don't wanna be late.
- Mmm.

23:58.280 --> 23:59.280
It's good.

24:00.600 --> 24:01.875
Oh, well,
this is weird.

24:02.240 --> 24:05.153
Elliot, it says that
you're calling me.

24:07.920 --> 24:10.560
No, don't fall
for it, Em.

24:11.560 --> 24:13.199
He's just doing a gag
with the phone.

24:13.280 --> 24:14.440
Am I right?

24:14.520 --> 24:17.354
He's such a whiz with these gadgets.
What's the trick, huh?

24:17.760 --> 24:19.672
What happens
if you pick up?

24:20.920 --> 24:21.920
What?

24:23.080 --> 24:24.309
What happens
if you answer?

24:31.880 --> 24:34.918
- Here. Let me do it.
- No. Let me do it.

24:45.240 --> 24:46.240
<i>Hello?</i>

24:48.840 --> 24:49.840
<i>Emily?</i>

24:52.360 --> 24:53.360
<i>You there?</i>

25:02.240 --> 25:03.469
Are you all right?

25:07.640 --> 25:09.120
What happened, dear?

25:11.520 --> 25:13.876
Look at what you did.
He's getting cold feet.

25:13.960 --> 25:15.896
Well, how exactly
am I responsible for that?

25:15.920 --> 25:17.832
Because of your
passive-aggressive jokes.

25:19.920 --> 25:21.036
Oh, my God!

25:22.520 --> 25:23.636
Oh!

25:25.200 --> 25:26.998
Okay, nobody panic.

25:27.720 --> 25:29.677
It's just a little accident.
I've got it.

25:32.640 --> 25:34.120
Ouch!

25:46.680 --> 25:49.718
<i>That voice, that was mine.
How can that be possible?</i>

25:49.800 --> 25:53.032
<i>I saw myself in those pictures.
That was me, wasn't it?</i>

25:53.120 --> 25:55.396
<i>Or no, was it him?</i>

25:56.640 --> 25:59.075
<i>So are there two of me?
I didn't think about that before,</i>

25:59.200 --> 26:00.714
<i>but that's possible, isn't it?</i>

26:00.800 --> 26:02.154
<i>Everyone's different here...</i>

26:02.800 --> 26:05.759
<i>Price, my dad, my mom...</i>

26:12.480 --> 26:13.480
<i>Me.</i>

26:33.640 --> 26:35.472
<i>But if this world
isn't mine...</i>

26:40.680 --> 26:41.909
<i>Then whose is it?</i>

27:12.680 --> 27:14.797
<i>This guy is definitely not me.</i>

27:21.520 --> 27:23.557
<i>And I am definitely not him.</i>

28:17.440 --> 28:19.193
<i>I need to find out
exactly who he is.</i>

28:28.600 --> 28:32.640
<i>Shit. The boot drive is encrypted.
Maybe he's more like me than I thought.</i>

29:10.640 --> 29:14.236
<i>Based on this, he doesn't have crippling
social anxiety or paranoia.</i>

29:15.160 --> 29:16.799
<i>He looks like
he's fun at parties,</i>

29:18.160 --> 29:19.276
<i>makes a good living,</i>

29:21.320 --> 29:22.595
<i>has lots of friends.</i>

29:26.880 --> 29:28.792
<i>Everything in his life
seems perfect.</i>

29:30.960 --> 29:33.031
<i>But nobody is as perfect
as they seem.</i>

29:46.000 --> 29:48.356
<i>Come on, come on, come on.
I know I'll find something.</i>

29:48.440 --> 29:50.432
<i>He can't be this happy.
No one is.</i>

29:51.880 --> 29:55.396
<i>Haven't you been paying attention?
Everyone has a secret.</i>

29:55.520 --> 29:57.239
<i>People are always
hiding something...</i>

29:57.640 --> 30:01.350
<i>Their vulnerabilities,
their fears, their shame.</i>

30:01.960 --> 30:03.792
<i>I don't care
how happy he looks.</i>

30:04.760 --> 30:06.319
<i>Everyone has a monster.</i>

30:08.600 --> 30:11.399
<i>The question is, what's his?</i>

30:21.080 --> 30:24.198
<i>And there it is.
A hidden partition,</i>

30:24.280 --> 30:27.000
<i>a drive full of files
he doesn't want anyone to see.</i>

30:45.080 --> 30:46.719
<i>These are images...</i>

30:58.040 --> 30:59.394
<i>Of me...</i>

31:03.320 --> 31:04.320
<i>My life.</i>

31:06.320 --> 31:09.392
<i>How does he know about me?
Did he somehow hack...</i>

31:11.560 --> 31:12.676
<i>my world?</i>

31:16.840 --> 31:19.674
<i>Am I his monster?</i>

31:31.400 --> 31:32.675
Who are you?

31:41.080 --> 31:42.400
I know this is fucked up.

31:42.480 --> 31:44.437
What are you doing
in my apartment?

31:48.880 --> 31:50.314
And why do you look like me?

31:55.960 --> 31:58.350
- I think we should talk.
- I'm calling the police.

31:59.160 --> 32:01.038
I don't know who you are
or what you want.

32:01.160 --> 32:03.629
- No, we can't involve the cops.
- Stay where you are!

32:09.560 --> 32:10.914
You're making
a mistake.

32:12.200 --> 32:13.554
Let's just take a seat.

32:16.560 --> 32:18.313
I promise you,
I can explain.

32:24.120 --> 32:25.270
My name is Elliot Alderson.

32:25.360 --> 32:29.274
I was born in Washington Township,
New Jersey, September 17, 1986.

32:34.880 --> 32:35.996
Same as you.

32:38.760 --> 32:40.399
You could've
looked all that up.

32:43.600 --> 32:45.080
Look at me, man.

32:46.520 --> 32:48.318
You really think
I'm making this up?

32:59.440 --> 33:00.635
Let's sit.

33:05.320 --> 33:06.800
I'm good where I am.

33:08.480 --> 33:09.630
Start talking.

33:12.480 --> 33:14.551
Why do you have those sketches
on your computer?

33:17.080 --> 33:18.230
What sketches?

33:20.600 --> 33:21.954
The hidden partition.

33:23.880 --> 33:25.280
How did you
get in there?

33:26.120 --> 33:29.238
Doesn't matter. I need you to tell me
why you made those sketches.

33:39.440 --> 33:41.636
Hey, you look
exactly like...

33:47.840 --> 33:50.400
Holy shit,
how is this happening?

33:51.840 --> 33:53.593
That's what I'm trying
to figure out.

33:54.440 --> 33:55.874
That's why
we need to talk.

34:27.600 --> 34:30.034
The files on your
hidden partition...

34:32.159 --> 34:33.514
What are they?

34:38.040 --> 34:40.110
Sometimes when
I get bored,

34:40.880 --> 34:43.190
I create people
in my head...

34:44.880 --> 34:46.109
Like him.

34:47.320 --> 34:50.154
You know, someone
with a more exciting life.

34:51.639 --> 34:53.154
Like a superhero,

34:54.880 --> 34:57.440
except his power
would be computers.

34:58.840 --> 35:02.197
He'd be a cybersecurity
engineer by day,

35:03.520 --> 35:05.671
vigilante hacker
by night.

35:09.640 --> 35:11.359
Is that what you are?

35:19.600 --> 35:21.557
What about the girl
with the brown hair?

35:24.760 --> 35:28.117
She's just, sort of,
like his partner in crime.

35:32.400 --> 35:33.834
And fsociety?

35:36.960 --> 35:40.556
That's just a dumb name
I came up with for a hacker group.

35:42.760 --> 35:44.240
You know...

35:45.520 --> 35:46.920
Fuck society?

35:49.880 --> 35:51.109
I figured that's

35:51.800 --> 35:54.872
what an anarchist hacker
would come up with.

36:12.840 --> 36:15.560
This is you, isn't it?

36:19.840 --> 36:21.832
Why did you
create this person?

36:28.080 --> 36:29.514
I guess...

36:32.480 --> 36:37.271
Sometimes I fantasize
about being him.

36:40.360 --> 36:41.589
So you want to be him?

36:46.440 --> 36:47.954
No, not really.

36:48.400 --> 36:49.400
Look at him.

36:50.960 --> 36:52.189
He's angry.

36:53.960 --> 36:55.314
He has no life.

36:57.600 --> 36:58.636
He's alone.

36:59.920 --> 37:01.320
He's not normal.

37:11.600 --> 37:13.557
Oh, shit, man.

37:15.240 --> 37:16.560
I'm sorry.

37:18.720 --> 37:19.995
<i>He shouldn't be.</i>

37:20.680 --> 37:21.909
<i>He's right.</i>

37:22.480 --> 37:23.914
<i>I'm not normal</i>

37:24.360 --> 37:27.159
<i>and I never will be,
no matter what world I'm in.</i>

37:27.240 --> 37:28.240
What is that?

37:29.800 --> 37:30.916
Did you hear that?

37:32.400 --> 37:33.516
What?

37:36.320 --> 37:38.471
It sounded like
you were talking to someone.

37:39.680 --> 37:41.478
<i>Shit, he can hear us.</i>

37:41.560 --> 37:42.880
There it is again.

37:48.600 --> 37:49.954
How are you doing that?

37:52.880 --> 37:54.280
This was a mistake.

37:55.720 --> 37:58.280
I don't belong here.
I was stupid to think that I did.

37:58.360 --> 37:59.360
Wait.

38:20.000 --> 38:21.036
Yo, man.

38:22.680 --> 38:23.716
Are you okay?

38:27.480 --> 38:28.675
Say something.

38:38.080 --> 38:39.480
Shit!

38:42.600 --> 38:43.636
Fuck!

38:46.840 --> 38:48.296
I'm gonna
go get some help.

39:04.840 --> 39:07.355
- Hello?
<i>- Oh, my God, Elliot.</i>

39:07.600 --> 39:08.954
<i>What have you done?</i>

39:10.720 --> 39:12.677
- Angela.
<i>- You are out of control.</i>

39:15.520 --> 39:17.557
<i>- The book.</i>
- What?

39:17.640 --> 39:20.599
<i>How were you able to find it?
You're so amazing.</i>

39:20.680 --> 39:22.911
<i>This is the best gift
anyone's ever given me.</i>

39:23.000 --> 39:25.356
- Hold on a second.
<i>- Seriously, Elliot,</i>

39:25.440 --> 39:28.080
<i>I'm so lucky to be marrying
someone like you.</i>

39:28.640 --> 39:29.869
Angela...

39:30.800 --> 39:33.440
- I'm not who you think I am.
<i>- Oh, you're not?</i>

39:34.160 --> 39:36.038
<i>Then what'd you do
with my best friend?</i>

39:36.280 --> 39:38.078
No, you don't understand.

39:43.240 --> 39:44.390
I lost you.

39:45.520 --> 39:46.520
<i>What?</i>

39:47.080 --> 39:49.515
<i>You never lost me.
I'm right here.</i>

39:51.760 --> 39:53.479
No, you don't get it.

39:53.600 --> 39:55.193
<i>No, I do get it.</i>

39:56.920 --> 39:59.754
<i>Look, all you have to do
is show up tomorrow,</i>

40:00.520 --> 40:02.896
<i>and then we'll finally be together
for the rest of our lives.</i>

40:02.920 --> 40:04.434
<i>Isn't that what you want too?</i>

40:06.520 --> 40:07.840
Of course,

40:09.000 --> 40:10.000
but...

40:10.080 --> 40:12.436
<i>Elliot, you always
overthink everything.</i>

40:13.240 --> 40:16.711
<i>You have to finally
let yourself be happy.</i>

40:17.160 --> 40:18.753
<i>That's all it takes.</i>

40:19.400 --> 40:23.440
<i>It's just a choice that you have to make,
a switch that you have to flick on.</i>

40:26.080 --> 40:27.673
<i>Do you love me, Elliot?</i>

40:29.120 --> 40:30.349
What?

40:31.120 --> 40:32.600
<i>Do you love me?</i>

40:36.120 --> 40:37.474
Of course I love you.

40:42.320 --> 40:43.720
I've always loved you.

40:45.280 --> 40:46.555
<i>Great,</i>

40:46.840 --> 40:48.559
<i>because I love you too.</i>

40:50.840 --> 40:52.354
<i>So how about it, then?</i>

40:52.880 --> 40:55.236
<i>You wanna start this new life
with me or what?</i>

40:55.840 --> 40:57.399
More than anything.

40:59.200 --> 41:01.840
<i>Okay, then it's settled.</i>

41:03.120 --> 41:04.679
<i>I'll see you tomorrow.</i>

41:14.800 --> 41:15.836
Help.

41:21.600 --> 41:23.000
Call someone.

41:28.560 --> 41:29.630
Please.

41:32.200 --> 41:33.759
Call an ambulance.

41:35.600 --> 41:37.000
I can't move.

41:39.920 --> 41:41.559
I need an ambulance.

41:46.640 --> 41:48.154
But I'll lose her.

41:51.960 --> 41:53.713
And I can't lose her again.

42:24.200 --> 42:25.759
I'm sorry.

42:52.320 --> 42:53.959
<i>I think you should
look away too.</i>

43:25.920 --> 43:30.153
<i>Please, don'tjudge me.
This was inevitable.</i>

43:30.760 --> 43:32.513
<i>You saw the earthquakes.</i>

43:33.080 --> 43:35.675
<i>Both of us can't exist here
in this world.</i>

43:37.440 --> 43:38.954
<i>I had no other choice.</i>
