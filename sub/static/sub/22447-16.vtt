Jonah:
Previously, on Andi Mack...

00:05.210 --> 00:07.670
We only have a week left
with each other.

00:07.670 --> 00:10.290
-I know.
-It's the world's
saddest countdown.

00:10.290 --> 00:13.290
Which is why we need
to make every last day epic.

00:13.290 --> 00:15.210
Bex:
We saw you at mini-golf.

00:15.210 --> 00:17.080
Bowie:
You saw me there
with Miranda.

00:17.080 --> 00:18.420
Bex:
And her daughter.

00:18.420 --> 00:20.790
I guess that means
she thinks it's serious.

00:20.790 --> 00:22.040
Are you?

00:23.120 --> 00:24.380
Bowie:
I don't know what to say.

00:24.380 --> 00:27.290
Jonah... I know
you're trying to help,

00:27.290 --> 00:29.420
but you're just
making it worse.

00:29.420 --> 00:32.000
I'm sorry,
I'm just trying to be
a good boyfriend.

00:32.000 --> 00:34.250
Jonah, you're not
my boyfriend.

00:34.250 --> 00:36.420
I told you at the bar mitzvah,
I changed my mind.

00:36.420 --> 00:37.880
I want the label.

00:37.880 --> 00:40.670
But now...
I don't know
if I want it.

00:52.750 --> 00:55.330
I don't wanna
go to school today.

00:55.330 --> 00:56.420
How come?

00:56.420 --> 00:58.330
I'm just...
not feeling it, you know?

00:58.330 --> 01:00.880
You just wanna lie around
all day and do nothin'?

01:00.880 --> 01:03.670
You kinda need a day
like that every once
in a while, right?

01:03.670 --> 01:05.250
I believe that, yes.

01:05.250 --> 01:07.460
Great!
I'm going to go back to bed.

01:07.460 --> 01:09.420
No, you're not.
You're goin' to school.

01:09.420 --> 01:13.250
What? You just said
I could take today off.

01:13.250 --> 01:15.540
No, I did not.

Instant replay:
Me: "You need a day off
every once in a while."

01:20.210 --> 01:22.210
You: "Yes, you do."

01:22.210 --> 01:24.250
A day, not to-day.

01:24.250 --> 01:25.580
I don't get to pick the day?

01:25.580 --> 01:27.750
No, you have to ask for it.

01:28.880 --> 01:31.210
May I please skip school today?

01:31.210 --> 01:32.460
Hmm...

01:34.000 --> 01:35.040
For what reason?

01:35.040 --> 01:38.210
I'm not feeling it.

01:38.210 --> 01:39.540
No, you may not.

01:39.540 --> 01:43.620
What?
What if I were to...
(groans)

01:43.620 --> 01:46.920
...groan, very loudly,
and say I have a stomachache?

01:46.920 --> 01:48.330
I'd like to think
you wouldn't lie to me.

01:48.330 --> 01:51.710
Well, I would like to think
I wouldn't have to.

01:51.710 --> 01:54.830
Andi, I have a really hard time
saying no to you.

01:54.830 --> 01:56.420
Please don't make this
any harder?

01:56.420 --> 01:57.960
Please just go
get dressed?

My new teachers
sent assignments
so I can be all caught up

04:40.750 --> 04:42.710
when I get to Phoenix.

04:42.710 --> 04:45.000
Bad enough
being the new kid.

04:45.000 --> 04:47.120
I can't afford to be behind.

04:47.120 --> 04:49.420
Listen, you woke up
this morning

04:49.420 --> 04:50.960
thinking you were
going to school.

04:50.960 --> 04:52.580
But by a beautiful twist of fate

04:52.580 --> 04:55.710
and some outdated circuitry,
you're not!

04:55.710 --> 04:57.210
Let's live on the edge.

04:57.210 --> 04:59.170
Let's face our fears.

04:59.170 --> 05:04.080
Let's... play the game
that shall not be named.

05:04.080 --> 05:05.210
Nope.

05:05.210 --> 05:07.290
Come on, you probably
don't even remember

05:07.290 --> 05:08.920
why you don't like it.

05:08.920 --> 05:11.210
It looks like
an innocent board game,

05:11.210 --> 05:14.290
but it's a soul-sucking vortex
of greed and pain.

05:14.290 --> 05:16.290
It turns good people bad!

05:16.290 --> 05:19.210
That game is toxic.

05:19.210 --> 05:22.210
But aside from all of that,
like, pretty fun, right?

05:22.210 --> 05:24.710
I will never
play that game again.

05:27.000 --> 05:28.830
Didn't wanna
have to do this.

05:30.210 --> 05:31.420
Do what?

05:39.250 --> 05:44.250
"I promise to play the game
of your choice and not get mad
and flip the board.

05:45.250 --> 05:47.080
Signed Buffy Driscoll."

05:48.330 --> 05:50.080
I can't believe
you kept this.

05:50.080 --> 05:52.380
It was my Hanukah gift
from you when we were eight.

05:52.380 --> 05:55.170
As you can see,
no expiration date.

05:55.170 --> 05:59.460
That's on you.
I am cashing it in.

05:59.460 --> 06:04.580
Aren't you forgetting?
You need at least three people
to play.

06:04.580 --> 06:06.330
I'm sure Andi's up already.

06:06.330 --> 06:11.380
-(line rings)
- Hi, it's Andi.
Please leave a message.

06:11.380 --> 06:12.750
Hmm.
She's not answering.

06:12.750 --> 06:15.380
-(beeps)
-Aw, that's too bad.

06:15.380 --> 06:17.250
I guess we can't play
after all.

06:19.420 --> 06:22.290
Hey, guys.
What's the plan?

06:26.210 --> 06:27.620
-Okay, okay, okay.
-Aah!

06:27.620 --> 06:30.210
-No, no, no, okay.
-(whimpers) Scared.

06:30.210 --> 06:31.250
Aah!

06:31.250 --> 06:32.750
(both laughing)

06:32.750 --> 06:35.670
Ah. Hmm.

06:35.670 --> 06:36.710
Ooh.

06:38.330 --> 06:39.380
Gross!

06:39.380 --> 06:41.210
No, this is gross.

06:41.210 --> 06:43.420
Oh! And it's lint.
It's lint.

06:43.420 --> 06:45.000
(laughs)
Oh, not on me!

06:45.000 --> 06:47.210
-Oh! Eww!
-(groans)

06:47.210 --> 06:48.210
(laughing)

06:48.210 --> 06:51.290
So, should we play
Truth or Dare?

06:51.290 --> 06:54.920
No. Besides, what dares
could we really do in here?

06:54.920 --> 06:56.210
What about Truth or Truth?

06:56.210 --> 06:58.210
That's just a conversation.

06:58.210 --> 07:01.210
I want to...

07:01.210 --> 07:04.620

Okay.

07:13.040 --> 07:16.290
"She or he is your best friend
forever, right?"

07:16.290 --> 07:17.500
Right.

07:17.500 --> 07:19.670
"But how well
do you really know them?

07:19.670 --> 07:22.210
Ask them these questions
and find out!"

07:22.210 --> 07:23.290
First question.

07:24.330 --> 07:27.040
"Describe your dream home."

07:27.040 --> 07:28.120

-Ah, jinx!
-Jinx, jinx!

We're just preparing him

08:50.380 --> 08:54.250
That's what you're afraid of?
Things with holes?

08:54.250 --> 08:57.000
But you love donuts
and donuts have holes.

08:57.000 --> 09:01.290
They have one hole.
I don't like things
with a lot of holes.

09:01.290 --> 09:04.710
A lot of small, icky,

-You know what?

09:30.290 --> 09:32.210

"What do you most regret
not saying to someone,

09:36.120 --> 09:38.420

09:38.420 --> 09:40.080
This is a good one.

09:41.210 --> 09:43.330
I'm not gonna
answer that question.

09:43.330 --> 09:44.670
Why not?

09:44.670 --> 09:46.960
Because it's a quiz
in a magazine,

09:46.960 --> 09:50.000
and I don't have
to answer a question
if I don't want to.

09:50.000 --> 09:51.750

09:51.750 --> 09:54.540
You don't have to answer
the question in the magazine.

09:54.540 --> 09:55.620
Thank you.

09:55.620 --> 09:58.290
Now it's me
asking you the question.

09:58.290 --> 09:59.620
Please don't.

10:01.120 --> 10:03.460
What do you most regret
not saying to someone,

10:03.460 --> 10:05.620

that question.

10:08.250 --> 10:09.380

10:12.170 --> 10:14.330
I'm not gonna answer
that one, either.

10:21.290 --> 10:23.790
Huh.
I'll buy it.

Cyrus:
That's your third set.

some condos.

10:28.920 --> 10:31.210
No, you can't do that
after you roll.

10:31.210 --> 10:33.210
You have to do it
before you roll.

10:33.210 --> 10:36.420
As long as it's my turn,
I can buy condos
whenever I want.

10:36.420 --> 10:37.960
It's in the rules.

10:54.540 --> 10:56.290
It's in here somewhere.

10:56.290 --> 10:59.710
Or it's not.
And that's why
you can't find it.

10:59.710 --> 11:01.500
Dude, just let her
buy the condos.

11:01.500 --> 11:06.330
Oh, I see.
You two have an alliance.

11:06.330 --> 11:08.750
And now you're gonna
bleed me dry,

11:08.750 --> 11:12.040
and you're gonna
love every minute of it,
aren't you?

11:12.040 --> 11:15.120
I mean... we might as well.

11:21.080 --> 11:23.170
I thought we were done
with secrets.

11:23.170 --> 11:27.170
This isn't really a secret,
it's just something I don't
wanna say out loud.

11:27.170 --> 11:30.620
-To you.
-I think you just
defined "secret."

11:30.620 --> 11:33.830
And you and me,
we don't have a great
track record with secrets.

11:33.830 --> 11:36.000
You are not gonna
let this go, are you?

11:36.000 --> 11:39.210
We are BFFs.

11:39.210 --> 11:40.920
This is about trust,

11:40.920 --> 11:42.790
friendship, family.

11:42.790 --> 11:44.330
I'm your daughter.

11:44.330 --> 11:46.420
Okay.

11:46.420 --> 11:48.420
Here it is.

11:48.420 --> 11:51.580
I regret not saying yes
to Bowie when he proposed.

11:55.710 --> 11:57.750
Say something.
You're mad?

11:57.750 --> 12:00.210
I'm not mad.

12:00.210 --> 12:01.500
Why would I be mad?

12:01.500 --> 12:03.330
Really?

12:03.330 --> 12:04.750
I'm not mad.

12:06.120 --> 12:08.580
I'm... thrilled!

12:08.580 --> 12:10.460
I thought this was
the best day ever before,

12:10.460 --> 12:12.580
but now it just got
even better!

12:12.580 --> 12:14.250
Come on,
you need to call Bowie
and tell him!

12:14.250 --> 12:16.460
-Now!
-I am not gonna do that.

12:17.790 --> 12:20.540
You mean, you're not
gonna do that now.

12:20.540 --> 12:24.330
I mean, I'm not gonna
do that ever.

12:25.330 --> 12:27.080
And neither are you.

12:31.960 --> 12:34.670
No!

12:34.670 --> 12:37.500
One hundred and sixteen
dollars, please.

12:37.500 --> 12:39.330
I have no money.

12:39.330 --> 12:40.580
I can't pay the rent!

12:40.580 --> 12:42.330
You must pay the rent.

12:42.330 --> 12:43.580
I can't pay the rent!

12:43.580 --> 12:46.250
I'll pay the rent!
Here.

12:46.250 --> 12:47.830
I thought we had
an alliance.

12:47.830 --> 12:51.170
We do, but I can have
an alliance with him,
too... can't I?

12:51.170 --> 12:55.210
Jonah, you can't be friends
with everybody in this game.

12:55.210 --> 12:58.380
You have to pick a side.

12:58.380 --> 13:00.580
You can go
with the money-grubbing
land baron

13:00.580 --> 13:02.540
determined to wipe
the rest of us out

13:02.540 --> 13:05.330
or you can side
with the little guy.

13:05.330 --> 13:11.330
And together, we will
both go down in flames,
we can't beat her.

13:11.330 --> 13:14.170
We can try.
The game's not over yet.

13:15.710 --> 13:18.420
You have to.
You have to tell him.

13:18.420 --> 13:20.080
Why won't you tell him?

13:20.080 --> 13:22.290
It's complicated.

13:22.290 --> 13:26.080
I am so tired
of hearing adults tell me
it's complicated.

13:26.080 --> 13:27.540
It is only complicated

13:27.540 --> 13:29.170
because you
make it complicated!

13:29.170 --> 13:32.000
Look, it all just happened
too fast.

13:32.000 --> 13:33.710
He proposed to me
before I was ready,

13:33.710 --> 13:37.080
and now it's too late,
and he's moved on
with his life.

13:37.080 --> 13:41.250
Wait. Are you saying
this is my fault?

13:41.250 --> 13:42.620
I'm the reason you two
aren't together,

13:42.620 --> 13:44.380
because I pushed Bowie
to propose?

13:44.380 --> 13:45.960
That is not
what I said at all.

13:45.960 --> 13:47.960
But it's what you think.

13:47.960 --> 13:49.210
Isn't it?

13:50.330 --> 13:54.920
What I think is...
it's complicated.

13:54.920 --> 13:56.540
That's not a no.

13:58.040 --> 13:59.540
I can't be here.

14:00.670 --> 14:02.000
Ugh!

14:08.500 --> 14:09.830
It's over.

14:13.880 --> 14:15.210
How much?

14:15.210 --> 14:19.290
You're on Buffy's
beachfront resort,
with three condos.

14:19.290 --> 14:20.670
It's over.

14:20.670 --> 14:23.540
I'm talkin' to Buffy.
I'm not talking to you.

14:25.000 --> 14:26.330
How much?

14:26.330 --> 14:29.210
Six thousand dollars.

14:31.830 --> 14:33.330
And I already owe you, what?

14:37.210 --> 14:41.170
Twelve thousand, five hundred
and thirty-five dollars.

14:41.170 --> 14:44.210
Not including the six thousand.

14:44.210 --> 14:45.290
The only way
you're gonna win now

14:45.290 --> 14:47.670
is if you borrow money
from another game.

14:48.960 --> 14:51.290
Cyrus:
Accept it, buddy.
It's over.

14:51.290 --> 14:52.830
It's not over!

14:54.420 --> 14:56.880
Now it's over!

15:05.210 --> 15:07.330
You know what I realized?

15:07.330 --> 15:11.290
We just had
our first big fight
as mother and daughter.

15:11.290 --> 15:13.290
Doesn't it feel good
to get it out of the way?

15:16.290 --> 15:17.250
Hello?

15:19.830 --> 15:21.210
I'm comin' in.

15:25.120 --> 15:26.710
Here I come.

15:33.250 --> 15:35.000
I'm right here.

15:38.040 --> 15:39.580
Come on.

15:39.580 --> 15:41.710
We had the best day.

15:41.710 --> 15:43.750
I don't want it
to end like this.

15:45.040 --> 15:47.210
Well, we don't always get
what we want.

15:48.210 --> 15:49.210
Do we?

15:50.210 --> 15:53.170
I was never gonna
tell you about Bowie.

15:53.170 --> 15:54.460
But when we were
in that fort,

15:54.460 --> 15:57.330
I felt like I could
tell you anything.

15:58.330 --> 16:00.330
It's very hard
being your mother

16:00.330 --> 16:03.000
when I also wanna be
your best friend.

16:03.000 --> 16:07.380
If you can be so honest
with me, why can't you be
honest with Bowie?

16:07.380 --> 16:10.080
Because he's moved on!

16:10.080 --> 16:11.540
I don't wanna stand in his way.

16:11.540 --> 16:15.170
I just...
I'm afraid I could
ruin his life.

16:15.170 --> 16:17.500
That's very considerate of you.

16:19.580 --> 16:24.790
Being so worried
that you might ruin
Bowie's life.

16:27.290 --> 16:30.290
But what about my life?

16:30.290 --> 16:33.330
-Andi--
-I know, you're sorry.

16:36.790 --> 16:38.750
And for the record,

16:38.750 --> 16:41.580
we're still having
our first big fight.

16:43.920 --> 16:45.830
Jonah, it happens
to all of us.

16:45.830 --> 16:48.330
It wasn't you,
we know that.

16:48.330 --> 16:50.000
It was the game.

16:50.000 --> 16:52.120
It wasn't the game.

16:52.120 --> 16:53.170
It was Andi.

16:53.170 --> 16:55.880
-Andi?
-She hasn't answered
any of my texts,

16:55.880 --> 16:58.670
and my calls
are going straight
to voice mail.

16:58.670 --> 17:00.210
Is she avoiding me?

17:00.210 --> 17:02.290
-I don't think so.
-Why would she?

17:02.290 --> 17:03.790
Where is this coming from?

17:03.790 --> 17:06.290
I know she tells you everything.

17:06.290 --> 17:07.380
What has she said
to you?

17:07.380 --> 17:10.120
-Nothing.
-About what?

17:10.120 --> 17:11.710
Is she breaking up with me?

17:11.710 --> 17:14.000
-Jonah--
-We have no idea
what you're talking about.

17:14.000 --> 17:16.290
-How could
she break up with you?
-Are you two even together?

17:17.880 --> 17:20.790
I told her I wanted us
to be a couple.

17:20.790 --> 17:22.540
-You did?
-Whoa.

17:23.670 --> 17:26.580
Clearly, she doesn't
tell us everything.

17:26.580 --> 17:28.250
The way you kept saying
to me during the game,

17:28.250 --> 17:30.710
"It's over, it's over,
its over,"

17:30.710 --> 17:32.830
all I could think about
was Andi.

17:34.500 --> 17:36.170
Why isn't she
getting back to me?

17:39.620 --> 17:41.210
She isn't getting back
to us, either.

17:41.210 --> 17:43.170
We haven't heard
from her all day.

17:43.170 --> 17:46.460
Whatever's going on with her,
it isn't about you.

17:46.460 --> 17:48.460
Oh.

17:48.460 --> 17:50.710
You think
it's about that guy
she met at the bar mitzvah?

17:50.710 --> 17:52.330
Which guy?

17:52.330 --> 17:54.960
The one she was dancing with?

17:54.960 --> 17:57.250
Has she said anything
to you about him?

17:57.250 --> 17:59.080
You know what's funny?

17:59.080 --> 18:02.960
We usually have
these conversations
with Andi about you.

18:02.960 --> 18:04.620
Why is that funny?

18:04.620 --> 18:10.420
Not like funny ha-ha.
More like funny wah-wah.

18:17.210 --> 18:21.170
I have something,
um, a problem.

18:21.170 --> 18:24.830
-It's hard to explain.
-Oh, just say it!

18:24.830 --> 18:26.540
The suspense is killing me.

18:26.540 --> 18:28.790
What do you do
when your teenage daughter
hates you?

18:31.460 --> 18:35.210
Mm...

18:35.210 --> 18:38.250
-Mom?
-Shh! I'm savoring
this moment.

18:38.250 --> 18:40.420
This moment?
What moment?

18:40.420 --> 18:45.250
The moment when your daughter
realizes what it was like
to be her mother.

18:45.250 --> 18:47.920
Andi isn't nearly as bad
as I was.

18:47.920 --> 18:51.710
Which is lucky,
because I would not
have been able to handle me.

18:51.710 --> 18:54.210
So what happened?

18:54.210 --> 18:59.250
I told Andi I wish
I had said yes when Bowie
asked me to marry him.

18:59.250 --> 19:01.620
Oh! It's not too late!

19:01.620 --> 19:04.750
-Yes, it is!
-No, no, you can call him,
call him right now.

19:04.750 --> 19:07.290
(laughs)
No! That's what Andi wants, too.

19:07.290 --> 19:09.210
What neither of you
seem to realize is that

19:09.210 --> 19:11.750
I've already caused enough havoc
in everyone's lives.

19:11.750 --> 19:14.040
I'm trying to reduce
my havoc quotient.

19:14.040 --> 19:15.960
Okay, that's admirable,

19:15.960 --> 19:18.920
-but this is your--
-Mom, one problem
at a time, please!

19:18.920 --> 19:21.420
Andi refuses to speak to me.

19:21.420 --> 19:23.170
Or even look at me.

19:23.170 --> 19:24.250
Ooh.

19:25.330 --> 19:26.960
Well, let's be honest.

19:26.960 --> 19:29.750
It's not like I ever
really got this right with you.

19:30.750 --> 19:31.960
I know.

19:33.210 --> 19:35.750
But you were Andi's mother
for 13 years.

19:37.170 --> 19:40.000
I think you're the mother
Andi needs right now.

19:41.170 --> 19:44.420
Oh... mm.

19:44.420 --> 19:46.830
Mom?

19:46.830 --> 19:48.880
Savoring another moment.

19:53.290 --> 19:55.540
Andi?
It's CeCe.

19:55.540 --> 19:56.960
Can I come in?

19:59.540 --> 20:01.250
Just me!

20:02.380 --> 20:04.330
You can talk to me.

20:06.290 --> 20:08.250
Okay, comin' in.

20:15.250 --> 20:16.920
Andi?

20:16.920 --> 20:19.170
Bex:
Mom, she's gone.

20:19.170 --> 20:20.420
Andi?

20:23.250 --> 20:25.290
Do you wanna tell me
what you guys fought about?

20:31.080 --> 20:32.920
Does she know
where you are right now?

20:38.210 --> 20:40.210
I'm gonna have to tell her.

20:44.380 --> 20:47.540
So, it's okay?

20:47.540 --> 20:49.210
I can stay with you?

20:50.290 --> 20:51.830
Of course.

20:53.620 --> 20:56.170
For as long as you want.

20:56.170 --> 20:57.330
Okay?

20:59.710 --> 21:05.380

Andi:
Next on Andi Mack...

21:33.250 --> 21:36.210
I'm taking you
to one of my favorite
art galleries.

21:36.210 --> 21:38.710
Andi:
You have a painting
in an art gallery?

21:38.710 --> 21:39.750
Wow!

21:39.750 --> 21:42.250
I'm being serious.

21:42.250 --> 21:43.880
That's why I brought you here.

21:43.880 --> 21:45.250
I just wanted to see
how you were doing.

21:45.250 --> 21:47.750
You know, with your... thing.

21:47.750 --> 21:50.000
You're not going
to tell Andi, right?

21:50.000 --> 21:52.080
They won't let me
play basketball,

21:52.080 --> 21:54.330
because I can't do
some stupid equations.

21:54.330 --> 21:56.210
Students (chanting):
Buffy! Buffy! Buffy!

21:56.210 --> 21:57.540
TJ:
Buffy's been right all along.

21:57.540 --> 22:00.290
I shouldn't have told you
about that.

22:00.290 --> 22:03.290
-I'm dead. Aren't I?
-You are so dead.
