00:01.367 --> 00:02.666
Previously on "Alias"...

00:02.667 --> 00:06.224
Tonight, at 2200 hours, the CIA
will conduct simultaneous raids

00:06.334 --> 00:08.700
on all Alliance facilities.

00:08.701 --> 00:11.962
And tomorrow morning,
God willing,

00:12.067 --> 00:14.567
The Alliance
will no longer exist.

00:16.701 --> 00:19.394
- Let's move in.
- Go, go, go.

00:26.235 --> 00:30.224
- Three agents down at SD-2.
- SD-9 has four down.

00:30.335 --> 00:32.634
We've gotten reports
from all team leaders.

00:32.634 --> 00:35.930
We appear to be in control
of all Alliance facilities.

00:41.536 --> 00:45.298
So, congratulations, sir.
The Alliance is gone.

00:45.403 --> 00:48.664
I just wanted to let you know
that phase one is complete.

00:48.770 --> 00:50.203
Good.

00:50.204 --> 00:52.336
Move on to phase two.

00:52.337 --> 00:55.269
I've been asked to confirm
that you are in position.

00:55.404 --> 00:57.169
Yes.

00:57.170 --> 00:59.670
Everything's in place.

01:01.000 --> 01:07.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:34.239 --> 01:37.864
Maybe when we're done here,
we should go back to Fiji.

01:39.206 --> 01:41.728
Yeah, we should.

01:41.840 --> 01:44.340
It was so great.

02:01.507 --> 02:04.007
I'm gonna take a shower.

03:18.545 --> 03:19.745
You're early.

03:19.746 --> 03:21.078
I've been compromised.

03:21.079 --> 03:22.244
How?

03:22.245 --> 03:25.370
Something I said.
How do you want me to handle it?

03:26.079 --> 03:29.204
Use her to send a message.

03:29.313 --> 03:31.813
Make it public.

03:58.581 --> 04:01.081
I heard you were here.

04:03.548 --> 04:05.780
I couldn't sleep.

04:05.781 --> 04:09.372
I was afraid I'd wake up
and find out this was a dream.

04:09.482 --> 04:11.982
I went for a run
to clear my mind.

04:12.017 --> 04:14.482
I ended up here.

04:14.982 --> 04:16.613
Any word on Dixon or Marshall?

04:16.615 --> 04:18.647
They'll be in debrief
for a while.

04:18.648 --> 04:22.045
Meanwhile, Sloane's been put
on Interpol's most wanted list.

04:27.116 --> 04:29.415
- About last night...
- Is this about Alice?

04:29.416 --> 04:32.109
- It's complicated.
- We're not together anymore.

04:33.217 --> 04:34.316
since when?

04:34.317 --> 04:36.839
since this morning.

04:36.950 --> 04:40.007
The truth is, we've been over
for a long time.

04:48.584 --> 04:51.084
I was thinking.

04:52.151 --> 04:56.879
I can actually go to the CIA
through the front door.

04:56.984 --> 04:59.541
And I can actually
give you a ride.

05:31.620 --> 05:34.518
This is Christine Phillips,
Clandestine Services graduate.

05:34.620 --> 05:37.586
Langley's approved her
observing our operations.

05:37.687 --> 05:38.686
Hi.

05:38.687 --> 05:40.686
FBI Assistant Director Kendall.

05:40.687 --> 05:43.676
This is Agent Michael Vaughn,
Agents Jack and Sydney Bristow.

05:43.787 --> 05:46.753
I've read your operational file.
It's a real honor.

05:46.854 --> 05:47.853
Thanks.

06:01.821 --> 06:04.287
sir, we got a situation
in Berlin.

06:04.288 --> 06:06.154
The networks
are carrying it live.

06:06.155 --> 06:07.721
I'm putting it through.

06:07.722 --> 06:09.021
This is all we know.

06:09.022 --> 06:12.215
A woman apparently has been
shoved out of a van.

06:12.322 --> 06:14.488
A speeding white van,
we're told.

06:14.489 --> 06:16.989
- This is in a public square...
- Oh, my God.

06:17.024 --> 06:18.422
sir, that's Agent Wallace.

06:18.423 --> 06:19.422
You know her?

06:19.423 --> 06:21.923
She's one of ours.

06:32.723 --> 06:35.746
Give me a better look
at those explosives.

06:35.857 --> 06:37.556
Looks like C-4.

06:37.557 --> 06:39.356
If the C-4's wired
with a remote trigger,

06:39.357 --> 06:42.084
any radio communication
could cause detonation.

06:46.724 --> 06:49.224
You're doing fine, Emma.

06:50.291 --> 06:54.223
Just do what I told you,
and you will be fine.

07:01.225 --> 07:04.157
Patch me through to Berlin.
You speak German, right?

07:04.291 --> 07:06.657
We'll have satellite coverage
in 30 seconds.

07:06.658 --> 07:09.158
KH-11 coming online now.

07:09.226 --> 07:11.726
Bump up the resolution.

07:23.726 --> 07:26.590
sir, I've got the Federal Office
on the line now.

07:26.693 --> 07:29.454
Tell them to put you through
to the ranking agent on site.

07:29.560 --> 07:32.060
The woman is CIA,
and random radio communication

07:32.093 --> 07:34.593
could detonate the explosives.

07:46.695 --> 07:51.059
# All around
the cobbler's bench #

07:51.161 --> 07:55.093
# The monkey
chased the weasel #

07:55.195 --> 07:59.752
# The monkey thought
it was all for good #

08:03.662 --> 08:09.060
# Pop goes the weasel #

08:09.162 --> 08:15.220
# A penny
for a spool of thread #

08:15.330 --> 08:19.558
# A penny for a needle #

08:19.663 --> 08:25.061
# That's the way
the money goes #

08:25.163 --> 08:28.890
# Pop... goes... #

08:28.997 --> 08:30.562
Come on, come on, come on!

08:36.530 --> 08:37.828
I speak English.

08:37.830 --> 08:42.024
# No patience to wait
till time goes by #

08:42.164 --> 08:45.527
Instruct all agents to shut down
radio communication.

08:45.631 --> 08:48.064
This woman may be wired
with a remote detonator.

08:48.065 --> 08:51.792
Agent Bristow, I've already
ordered radio silence.

08:51.898 --> 08:54.398
# Pop #

09:28.334 --> 09:30.834
Excuse me.

09:32.067 --> 09:34.567
Are you all right?

09:37.235 --> 09:38.800
Hi.

09:38.801 --> 09:40.867
Are you okay?

09:40.868 --> 09:44.322
Sorry.
I just wasn't ready for that.

09:45.868 --> 09:47.434
Don't be sorry.

09:47.435 --> 09:50.798
The CIA lost
an exemplary agent today.

09:50.902 --> 09:53.697
Those of you who knew Emma
may find it difficult to focus,

09:53.802 --> 09:56.101
but I'll ask you to try.

09:56.102 --> 09:59.431
For two months, she was tasked
with a deep-cover assignment.

09:59.536 --> 10:04.059
Her objective was to gain
the trust of this man.

10:04.169 --> 10:06.669
Dr. Renzo Markovic,
a former R&D scientist

10:06.703 --> 10:09.136
who's been developing
a classified technology

10:09.137 --> 10:11.728
under the project heading
"Helix. "

10:11.836 --> 10:15.324
He's received preliminary bids
from terrorist organizations.

10:15.437 --> 10:17.202
- Weapons?
- We don't know.

10:17.203 --> 10:19.136
That's the question
Agent Wallace

10:19.137 --> 10:20.969
was trying to answer.

10:20.970 --> 10:22.969
Agent Wallace may not be
the only casualty

10:22.970 --> 10:24.469
in our effort against Markovic.

10:24.470 --> 10:26.403
She was sent undercover
with a partner,

10:26.404 --> 10:27.836
another CIA operative

10:27.837 --> 10:30.359
whom we now presume
to be captured or dead.

10:30.470 --> 10:31.836
His final transmission

10:31.837 --> 10:34.303
indicated he was
proceeding to Cayo Concha

10:34.304 --> 10:36.804
off the coast
of the Dominican Republic.

10:36.904 --> 10:39.137
Markovic leases
one of the lower floors

10:39.138 --> 10:42.570
in the Serena del Sol resort,
where he conducts his research.

10:42.671 --> 10:45.228
If our operative's alive,
he's being held there.

10:45.338 --> 10:48.463
Agent Bristow, you're on point.
Agent Vaughn, assisting.

10:48.571 --> 10:50.438
Conditions for success
are twofold.

10:50.439 --> 10:52.961
Acquire what intel you can
on Project: Helix

10:53.105 --> 10:54.538
and bring our man home.

10:54.539 --> 10:55.872
Who is he?

10:55.873 --> 10:57.872
He's one
of our most decorated agents.

10:57.873 --> 11:00.373
Here's his file.

11:00.906 --> 11:02.805
James Lennox.

11:02.806 --> 11:05.306
You leave tonight.

11:14.340 --> 11:16.372
- Hi.
- Hi.

11:16.373 --> 11:18.339
- Ready to go?
- Yeah.

11:18.340 --> 11:20.840
Come on in.
I'll get my stuff.

11:24.441 --> 11:26.941
Nice place.

11:29.441 --> 11:31.073
I'm gonna get a new couch.

11:31.074 --> 11:32.874
Yeah?

11:32.875 --> 11:35.375
Well, I don't know.

11:36.608 --> 11:39.108
So, this is where you live.

11:42.208 --> 11:44.341
This is where I live.

11:44.342 --> 11:46.274
I love it.

11:46.275 --> 11:48.775
I'm ready.

11:55.742 --> 11:57.941
Okay, we, um...

11:57.942 --> 11:59.409
We should go right now.

11:59.410 --> 12:00.775
Hey.

12:00.776 --> 12:03.901
Francie, this is Michael...
from the bank.

12:04.043 --> 12:05.909
Hey, Francie,
nice to meet you.

12:05.910 --> 12:07.809
Nice to put a face
with the name.

12:07.810 --> 12:10.109
Same here.

12:10.110 --> 12:12.871
- We should catch our plane.
- Another business trip?

12:12.977 --> 12:15.636
Just a finance conference
in New York overnight.

12:15.743 --> 12:17.209
Well, have a good trip.

12:17.210 --> 12:19.710
It's nice to meet you.
Bye.

12:20.911 --> 12:23.411
I'll see you later.

13:01.147 --> 13:05.204
# It's so easy to blow up
your problems #

13:05.347 --> 13:09.336
# It's so easy to play up
your breakdown #

13:09.480 --> 13:13.276
# It's so easy to fly through
a window #

13:13.380 --> 13:14.546
# It's so... #

13:14.547 --> 13:17.910
Arden Jezek, Markovic's
chief of security at the resort.

13:18.014 --> 13:19.646
He's got access
to Project: Helix

13:19.647 --> 13:21.679
and probably knows
where Lennox is.

13:21.680 --> 13:23.980
Why aren't we going after
Markovic directly?

13:23.981 --> 13:26.572
Surveillance teams say
they lost track of him.

13:26.681 --> 13:29.181
Jezek's our best shot.

14:03.750 --> 14:07.739
# It's so tough to get up #

14:07.850 --> 14:10.372
# It's so tough #

14:10.483 --> 14:12.983
Hi.

14:18.217 --> 14:20.050
I've injected a cardiotoxin.

14:20.051 --> 14:22.949
You'll have a heart attack
unless you do as we say.

14:23.052 --> 14:24.950
Then you get the antidote.
Clear?

14:24.951 --> 14:27.849
- Yeah.
- Is Agent Lennox still alive?

14:27.951 --> 14:29.583
- Yes.
- Where is he?

14:31.385 --> 14:34.010
Sublevel, Room 47.

14:35.719 --> 14:38.084
You'll escort us
and help my partner download

14:38.085 --> 14:40.642
everything you have
on Project: Helix.

14:42.485 --> 14:44.985
Smile.

14:46.453 --> 14:48.953
They are with me.

14:58.753 --> 15:01.253
- I'll see you at the exit point.
- Yeah.

15:10.254 --> 15:12.586
Sydney, if Agent Lennox
is still alive,

15:12.587 --> 15:15.144
he may have undergone
psychological reconditioning.

15:15.254 --> 15:17.754
You could be walking
into a trap.

15:28.522 --> 15:30.621
Let's start over
from the beginning.

15:30.622 --> 15:32.621
I already told you everything.

15:36.256 --> 15:38.355
Ahh...

15:40.789 --> 15:42.522
Aah!

15:54.523 --> 15:57.284
My name is Sydney Bristow.

15:57.390 --> 16:00.481
I'm a CIA agent.
I've come to take you home.

16:00.590 --> 16:03.885
I can't see.
I can't see.

16:03.991 --> 16:05.322
I can't see!

16:07.424 --> 16:11.117
They used metachlorozine on you.
It's a photoreactive acid.

16:11.224 --> 16:13.689
I'm covering your eyes
with a bandage.

16:13.690 --> 16:16.190
Keep this on, or you
could be permanently blinded.

16:16.291 --> 16:18.791
You're okay.

16:20.458 --> 16:22.791
You're sweating because
the poison's taking effect.

16:22.792 --> 16:25.292
Type, and you'll be fine.

16:26.858 --> 16:29.358
You're in the system.

16:37.993 --> 16:39.391
You're doing great.

16:39.392 --> 16:41.892
Emma Wallace.
Has she reported in yet?

16:45.726 --> 16:48.226
Stay here.

16:57.960 --> 17:00.460
Aah!

17:23.295 --> 17:25.194
Oh, thank you.

17:25.194 --> 17:27.694
Shut your eyes.
Shut your eyes.

17:32.529 --> 17:34.028
Oh.

17:34.029 --> 17:36.529
Okay, one more.

17:44.496 --> 17:47.462
Your eyes should normalize
in a few minutes.

17:47.563 --> 17:50.063
Okay.

17:50.763 --> 17:53.263
Thank you.

17:55.897 --> 17:58.397
You okay?

18:01.364 --> 18:03.864
What do you think?

18:03.964 --> 18:06.363
No signs of post-traumatic
stress disorder

18:06.364 --> 18:08.730
or symptoms
of behavior modification.

18:08.731 --> 18:11.030
He was holding his own
with the interrogators.

18:11.031 --> 18:13.553
He risked losing his sight
to get us out.

18:15.165 --> 18:17.665
I don't know.

18:22.999 --> 18:25.499
We'll know more
after the psych eval.

18:33.533 --> 18:34.932
How are you doing?

18:34.933 --> 18:37.524
I could have sworn
you were a blonde.

18:37.633 --> 18:39.166
I was.

18:39.167 --> 18:42.224
My hair's usually brown.

18:42.367 --> 18:44.232
Hard to keep track.

18:44.233 --> 18:50.688
It's nice to... see the face
of the person who saved my life.

18:53.400 --> 18:55.900
So, um...

18:57.068 --> 18:59.568
Where is Emma?

19:00.634 --> 19:04.623
Is she back in L.A.?

19:07.468 --> 19:09.968
Jim...

19:10.802 --> 19:13.768
Emma's dead.

19:18.302 --> 19:20.802
I'm so sorry.

19:30.936 --> 19:33.436
We know
you've been through hell,

19:33.536 --> 19:35.436
and I apologize
that your homecoming

19:35.437 --> 19:38.267
had to be celebrated
with a psych evaluation.

19:38.370 --> 19:40.868
You've been given
a clean bill of health.

19:40.869 --> 19:43.369
I'm sure it doesn't feel
like that.

19:43.437 --> 19:46.403
Agent Wallace's death
has left questions unanswered.

19:46.503 --> 19:48.836
Can you tell us
how you infiltrated

19:48.837 --> 19:50.569
Dr. Markovic's organization?

19:50.570 --> 19:52.969
We were hired on
as security experts

19:52.970 --> 19:54.903
at his villa in Berlin.

19:54.904 --> 19:57.236
Emma, Agent Wallace,

19:57.237 --> 20:00.669
gained Markovic's trust
enough to become his driver.

20:00.771 --> 20:01.837
In that capacity,

20:01.838 --> 20:04.395
she was privy to a phone
conversation between Markovic

20:04.504 --> 20:06.737
and someone she believed
to be his superior,

20:06.738 --> 20:08.071
in which they indicated

20:08.072 --> 20:10.572
Project: Helix
was ready for testing.

20:10.604 --> 20:13.468
Are you saying Markovic
answers to someone else?

20:13.572 --> 20:15.738
That was Agent Wallace's
impression.

20:15.739 --> 20:16.938
They didn't use names.

20:16.939 --> 20:19.666
It was just a voice
on the speakerphone.

20:19.806 --> 20:21.604
You never heard this voice?

20:21.605 --> 20:24.105
No.

20:24.173 --> 20:26.673
How's your eyesight?

20:26.772 --> 20:28.605
It's better.

20:28.606 --> 20:31.005
Can you tell us
what led to your capture?

20:31.006 --> 20:33.563
When we reported to Langley,
the project was proceeding.

20:33.673 --> 20:37.002
We were ordered to break into
the facility in Cayo Concha

20:37.107 --> 20:38.672
and hack the central database.

20:38.673 --> 20:40.972
I knew there was a chance
we'd be caught.

20:40.973 --> 20:43.495
I decided to go alone
so I could transmit the data

20:43.606 --> 20:46.401
to Emma in Berlin
if I were trapped.

20:47.307 --> 20:49.606
They moved in
before I could do that.

20:49.607 --> 20:52.039
Do you have any idea
how she was compromised?

20:52.040 --> 20:54.540
No, I don't.

20:56.374 --> 20:59.238
Okay. We have a pretty
comprehensive picture here.

20:59.341 --> 21:02.068
There's a driver waiting
to take you to a safehouse.

21:02.175 --> 21:04.675
Is there anything
you'd like to add?

21:09.008 --> 21:11.508
We were engaged.

21:25.276 --> 21:27.341
In a case like this,
we start by digitizing

21:27.342 --> 21:29.864
the news footage
that covered the bombing.

21:30.743 --> 21:33.243
You like Italian food?

21:33.277 --> 21:35.834
I have a boyfriend.

21:35.943 --> 21:37.276
Yeah, me too.

21:37.277 --> 21:39.509
Hey, Weiss.

21:39.510 --> 21:42.010
Excuse me.

21:42.744 --> 21:44.543
I think the new girl
has a thing for me.

21:44.544 --> 21:46.743
I was going over
Agent Wallace's contact log.

21:46.744 --> 21:48.543
She phoned in every two days.

21:48.544 --> 21:50.410
The slightest discrepancy
in protocol,

21:50.411 --> 21:52.643
and she contacted us
for verification.

21:52.644 --> 21:54.444
The day Lennox says
he was captured,

21:54.445 --> 21:56.410
we have no records
of anything from her.

21:56.411 --> 21:58.477
No warning,
no extraction request.

21:58.478 --> 22:01.103
Why didn't she make contact?

22:03.244 --> 22:05.577
Agent Weiss.

22:05.578 --> 22:07.710
Roll it back.

22:07.711 --> 22:10.211
That flash of static
right before the blast.

22:10.212 --> 22:12.445
An RF transmitter would account
for the interference,

22:12.446 --> 22:14.311
but all radio signals
were shut off.

22:14.312 --> 22:17.142
Wait. Run it back.
slow it down a little bit.

22:17.245 --> 22:18.945
There.

22:18.946 --> 22:20.445
If the signal
interrupted the feed,

22:20.446 --> 22:22.445
it had to come from
our trigger man's detonator.

22:22.446 --> 22:24.678
Which would place him
within a block.

22:24.679 --> 22:27.668
Find where the van was parked.
Check traffic cams.

22:27.779 --> 22:30.279
We may have this guy's face
on video.

22:41.547 --> 22:44.047
Lennox?

23:01.315 --> 23:03.815
Jim?

23:15.749 --> 23:19.272
Beware of the grieving man
and his bottle.

23:24.616 --> 23:27.116
Emma used to say

23:27.149 --> 23:31.206
that she had spent
so much of her life

23:31.317 --> 23:33.049
pretending to be other people

23:33.050 --> 23:35.641
that she was afraid
she might disappear.

23:35.750 --> 23:39.113
And I have been sitting here,

23:39.250 --> 23:42.341
trying to remember
all her aliases.

23:43.784 --> 23:46.217
And you're right.

23:46.218 --> 23:48.911
It's hard to keep track.

23:56.918 --> 24:00.111
I lost my fiancé last year.

24:01.919 --> 24:04.384
And I know we were
trained to compartmentalize

24:04.385 --> 24:08.181
things that hurt too much.

24:08.286 --> 24:11.081
But I still haven't been
able to do that.

24:12.952 --> 24:15.884
But as hard as it is,

24:16.019 --> 24:21.383
I would rather feel it
than to not feel anything.

24:29.454 --> 24:31.954
Hey.

24:52.521 --> 24:55.021
Oh...

24:57.189 --> 24:59.689
I'm sorry.

25:04.556 --> 25:06.388
Agent Bristow?

25:06.389 --> 25:08.889
Agent Lennox?

25:13.656 --> 25:15.855
What's going on?

25:15.856 --> 25:17.322
Back up against the wall.

25:17.323 --> 25:18.888
What is this?

25:18.889 --> 25:21.389
- Wait. Wait.
- Get your hands off me!

25:25.757 --> 25:28.223
All right, stay down!
Stay down!

25:28.224 --> 25:30.656
Sydney, go!
Sydney, go!

25:30.657 --> 25:31.923
- Okay.
- Stay down!

25:31.924 --> 25:34.446
Go. Go.
Sydney, go!

25:39.925 --> 25:41.957
Okay, take it easy!
Take it easy!

25:41.958 --> 25:43.857
What is it?

25:43.858 --> 25:46.824
He's gonna be placed
in federal custody.

25:54.325 --> 25:55.324
What's going on?

25:55.325 --> 25:58.314
We've decrypted the specs
on Project: Helix.

25:58.459 --> 26:00.025
The data describes
a breakthrough

26:00.026 --> 26:02.092
in next-generation
molecular gene therapy.

26:02.093 --> 26:03.591
It refers to a new procedure

26:03.592 --> 26:06.456
whereby a patent’s face
and body are reshaped

26:06.559 --> 26:08.858
to identically resemble
someone else.

26:08.859 --> 26:11.848
Agent Lennox was the first
test subject to be doubled.

26:13.326 --> 26:15.425
Doubled how?
Like cloning?

26:15.426 --> 26:16.659
Not exactly.

26:16.660 --> 26:19.182
You're saying the man we rescued
isn't Lennox?

26:19.293 --> 26:20.492
It's possible.

26:20.493 --> 26:21.525
So who is he?

26:21.526 --> 26:24.253
Based on our intel,
the procedure's first recipient

26:24.360 --> 26:27.951
was the man who created
the technology, Dr. Markovic.

26:29.761 --> 26:33.284
There is no way the man we have
in custody is Dr. Markovic.

26:33.427 --> 26:35.194
I know it sounds insane,

26:35.195 --> 26:37.560
but as we were analyzing
the news footage,

26:37.561 --> 26:41.254
Phillips noticed the
interference of an RF signal.

26:41.361 --> 26:43.861
We got this
from a traffic camera.

27:05.529 --> 27:06.895
Over the last few years,

27:06.896 --> 27:10.293
it's become common practice
for wanted terrorists

27:10.396 --> 27:12.196
to employ men
who look like them.

27:12.197 --> 27:15.129
Decoys designed to mislead
intelligence agencies.

27:15.230 --> 27:17.730
With this procedure, that
would no longer be necessary.

27:17.763 --> 27:19.296
Men like Osama bin Laden

27:19.297 --> 27:21.663
could simply be made
to look like someone else.

27:21.664 --> 27:24.221
That is not something we
can afford to have advertised

27:24.330 --> 27:25.529
on the black market.

27:25.530 --> 27:27.663
How is this possible
without scarring?

27:27.664 --> 27:29.163
The procedure isn't surgical.

27:29.164 --> 27:31.297
The patent’s genetic code
is altered

27:31.298 --> 27:33.798
to reshape
their physical attributes.

27:33.931 --> 27:34.930
Is it reversible?

27:34.931 --> 27:36.130
It's unclear.

27:36.131 --> 27:39.528
It only works on people of
a certain genetic disposition.

27:39.631 --> 27:42.098
And the recipient must be
in a comatose state

27:42.099 --> 27:44.826
for several days
while their cells regenerate.

27:44.932 --> 27:47.364
The data indicates
the only way to distinguish

27:47.365 --> 27:50.331
the real person from the double
is by an ocular scan.

27:50.432 --> 27:53.421
A flaw in the iris was built
into the procedure

27:53.532 --> 27:55.064
to tell them apart.

27:55.065 --> 27:57.398
Even if Lennox is
who he says he is,

27:57.399 --> 28:01.728
there's no way of guaranteeing
he's not the man in that video.

28:01.833 --> 28:03.665
I'm telling you,
the man we rescued

28:03.666 --> 28:06.166
just had his life destroyed.

28:07.100 --> 28:08.998
He's on our side.

28:20.567 --> 28:22.799
He is who he says he is.

28:22.800 --> 28:25.459
What the hell do you mean,
I've been doubled?

28:25.568 --> 28:27.233
The project
you were investigating...

28:27.234 --> 28:28.300
Project: Helix.

28:28.301 --> 28:31.392
It's a prototype
surgical gene resequencer.

28:31.501 --> 28:33.300
Markovic created a technique

28:33.301 --> 28:35.823
that allows people to change
their appearance.

28:35.935 --> 28:38.334
That's why we gave you
the ocular scan.

28:38.335 --> 28:40.994
To make sure that you
were really you.

28:41.135 --> 28:45.396
Do we know who it was,
the man who took my identity?

28:47.135 --> 28:49.635
Dr. Markovic.

28:52.602 --> 28:57.330
Now I know why Emma didn't call
for an extraction.

28:57.436 --> 29:00.368
She had no idea I was captured.

29:02.636 --> 29:05.136
We had a hotel room in Berlin.

29:06.336 --> 29:08.836
She thought she was with me.

29:13.337 --> 29:16.894
Markovic had the Helix prototype
taken off Cayo Concha.

29:17.037 --> 29:19.537
We've tracked it
to a freight yard in Poland.

29:19.671 --> 29:22.569
He's trying to hide it.
What's the next move?

29:22.671 --> 29:24.403
I've been ordered to find
the prototype,

29:24.404 --> 29:26.926
download the schematics,
then destroy it.

29:27.038 --> 29:29.538
I'm coming with you.

29:57.506 --> 30:00.336
This is Mountaineer.
We're in the train yard.

30:00.439 --> 30:02.239
Copy.
We've got you on satellite.

30:02.240 --> 30:04.738
We're reading five guards.

30:04.739 --> 30:07.705
One on the north side
of Track 2.

30:09.373 --> 30:11.873
One between Tracks 1 and 2.

30:19.374 --> 30:21.474
Two on the southern perimeter,

30:21.475 --> 30:23.975
and one on top
of the center car.

30:30.308 --> 30:32.574
Wait.
We just lost the last guard.

30:32.575 --> 30:35.075
Hold while we reacquire
his signal.

31:10.077 --> 31:12.076
Do you have the drill?

31:12.077 --> 31:13.076
Drill.

31:21.578 --> 31:24.373
All right, I'm having trouble
seeing the third tumbler.

31:24.478 --> 31:26.344
The borescope's jammed.
Hang on.

31:26.345 --> 31:28.845
Do you have the audio?

31:35.212 --> 31:37.277
All right, here we go.

31:37.278 --> 31:39.869
All right, all right,
all right.

31:42.979 --> 31:45.479
- We got it.
- Okay.

31:55.413 --> 31:57.913
I'm gonna rig the explosives.

32:02.047 --> 32:04.547
All right, Boot Camp,
I'm into the data log.

32:04.613 --> 32:07.443
Copy that. Standing by
to receive the schematics.

32:13.848 --> 32:15.880
All right, wait a second.

32:15.881 --> 32:18.642
According to this,
the sequencer's been used twice.

32:20.081 --> 32:21.347
What?

32:21.348 --> 32:23.905
I'm not the only one
who's been doubled.

32:25.981 --> 32:28.481
Who else?

32:30.148 --> 32:32.648
It doesn't say.

32:43.216 --> 32:45.875
Agent Vaughn, a call
was routed through the PBX

32:45.983 --> 32:48.381
you need to take right away.

32:48.382 --> 32:51.075
- Who am I talking to?
- My name is James Lennox.

32:51.183 --> 32:53.978
The man you rescued
is Dr. Renzo Markovic.

32:54.083 --> 32:56.316
I know that sounds impossible.

32:56.317 --> 32:59.510
He's developed some kind
of genetic doubling prototype.

32:59.617 --> 33:00.616
Yes, we know.

33:00.617 --> 33:03.139
I was captured trying
to infiltrate his medical lab

33:03.250 --> 33:04.716
on Concho Caya.

33:04.717 --> 33:07.239
They knew the CIA would send
a team after me,

33:07.383 --> 33:08.850
and they set you up.

33:08.851 --> 33:11.250
I just escaped 12 hours ago

33:11.251 --> 33:13.617
while they were trying to
transport me off the island.

33:13.618 --> 33:16.083
- Where are you now?
- I'm in Poland.

33:16.084 --> 33:18.283
I've tracked the prototype
to a freight yard.

33:18.284 --> 33:19.917
I'm gonna destroy it.

33:19.918 --> 33:21.617
I got him.

33:21.618 --> 33:24.675
He's two miles away
and traveling alone.

33:24.785 --> 33:27.478
It could be Markovic
trying to prevent us

33:27.585 --> 33:29.084
from sabotaging the prototype.

33:29.085 --> 33:31.676
There's no way to be certain.

33:31.785 --> 33:35.148
We just conducted a test
confirming Lennox's identity.

33:35.252 --> 33:36.952
The ocular scan doesn't work!

33:36.953 --> 33:39.251
That was disinformation
he wanted you to download

33:39.252 --> 33:40.651
so you would trust him!

33:40.652 --> 33:42.618
The ocular scan is a joke!

33:42.619 --> 33:45.551
Listen carefully.
Do not approach the train yard.

33:45.686 --> 33:47.319
I'm losing you.

33:47.320 --> 33:48.751
I can't hear you.

33:48.752 --> 33:51.650
Hello? I'm losing you!

33:51.753 --> 33:54.253
Hello!

34:15.821 --> 34:17.553
Put me through
on a separate channel.

34:17.554 --> 34:20.054
I only want her to hear this.

34:20.987 --> 34:23.886
Sydney, don't react.
Just listen.

34:23.987 --> 34:26.254
Do not take your eyes
off the man you're with.

34:26.255 --> 34:29.914
We just got a call from someone
claiming to be Agent Lennox.

34:30.022 --> 34:32.748
He's on his way to you.
It looks like he's alone.

34:32.856 --> 34:36.185
Clear your throat if you copy.

34:38.590 --> 34:41.090
Backup copy.

34:44.723 --> 34:47.746
There's no way for us to verify
the identity of either man.

34:47.889 --> 34:50.089
Disarm the man you're with,
then take cover.

34:50.090 --> 34:52.022
Do the same to the man
heading your way.

34:52.023 --> 34:54.887
Once they're secure, lead them
to the extraction point.

34:54.989 --> 34:57.922
We'll figure this out
when they're in custody.

34:58.023 --> 35:00.523
Don't move.

35:02.891 --> 35:05.391
What are you doing, Sydney?

35:09.991 --> 35:11.690
Against the wall.

35:11.691 --> 35:14.191
On your knees.
Hands behind your head.

35:16.458 --> 35:19.583
Put your hands behind your head.

35:19.725 --> 35:22.225
On your knees.

35:24.592 --> 35:26.691
He's secure.
How far away is the other man?

35:26.692 --> 35:30.180
What other man?
You think I'm Markovic.

35:30.292 --> 35:32.125
Cloud cover has moved
over your position.

35:32.126 --> 35:34.091
We're blind,
but he's got to be there.

35:34.092 --> 35:36.614
- You have to trust me.
- Cuff yourself to the rail.

35:36.726 --> 35:39.226
If someone is headed this way
claiming to be me,

35:39.326 --> 35:40.892
it's Markovic, all right?

35:40.893 --> 35:43.092
I'm telling you,
he is setting us up.

35:43.093 --> 35:44.459
Why is he alone?

35:44.460 --> 35:47.585
He knows if our satellite
picks up a security team,

35:47.694 --> 35:49.959
we won't hesitate to destroy
the prototype.

35:49.960 --> 35:52.092
It is his only play
to get his face back.

35:52.093 --> 35:55.650
Sydney, he killed Emma.
He will kill you.

36:09.428 --> 36:11.260
Hold it!

36:11.261 --> 36:13.560
Drop the gun and turn around.

36:15.895 --> 36:18.395
Aah!

36:20.662 --> 36:23.162
You don't work for Markovic.
You're CIA.

36:23.197 --> 36:25.261
I'm Jim Lennox.
I'm CIA, too.

36:25.262 --> 36:27.762
Drop the gun now.

36:34.996 --> 36:36.295
Put the gun down.

36:36.296 --> 36:38.529
Markovic's men
are on their way here.

36:38.530 --> 36:41.030
Drop it, or I'll shoot!

36:41.363 --> 36:43.863
We have to trust each other.

36:45.797 --> 36:48.297
Get down!

36:50.997 --> 36:53.497
Sydney!

37:29.566 --> 37:31.332
You killed Emma,
you son of a bitch!

37:31.333 --> 37:34.628
- He's Lying! He has to say that!
- I was tortured for four weeks.

37:34.766 --> 37:37.032
He knows enough
to pass himself off as me.

37:37.033 --> 37:39.533
You're not walking out of here.

37:41.234 --> 37:43.927
Neither of you
can drop your guns.

37:51.834 --> 37:53.933
What are you doing?

37:56.968 --> 38:00.263
I hope you like your face,
Dr. Markovic.

38:01.968 --> 38:04.067
You're gonna have it
for a long time.

38:07.401 --> 38:09.901
Don't!

39:11.205 --> 39:14.365
Yeah, all right.
Yeah, appreciate it.

39:15.272 --> 39:17.772
Four weeks off.
The least they could do.

39:17.873 --> 39:20.395
Yeah, well,
they offered me counseling.

39:20.539 --> 39:23.971
But I haven't not worked
in eight years.

39:25.106 --> 39:27.239
Where are you headed?

39:27.240 --> 39:29.005
Fiji.

39:29.006 --> 39:31.272
I've never been there before.

39:31.273 --> 39:34.932
Emma and I were gonna go
for our honeymoon.

39:35.040 --> 39:37.305
She was from there.

39:37.306 --> 39:39.806
I know.

39:40.074 --> 39:42.574
I knew her.

39:43.007 --> 39:45.507
You knew Emma?

39:47.808 --> 39:51.934
One thing about my fiancé.

39:54.242 --> 39:57.867
I was lucky to have known him
for as long as I did.

40:04.709 --> 40:07.209
Thank you.

40:30.210 --> 40:31.709
# Where do we go? #

40:31.710 --> 40:35.073
# Nobody knows #

40:37.877 --> 40:44.208
# I've got to say
I'm on my way down #

40:45.377 --> 40:50.866
# God give me style
and give me grace #

40:52.978 --> 40:59.433
# God put a smile
upon my face #

41:15.679 --> 41:20.577
# Where do we go
to draw the line? #

41:23.380 --> 41:28.778
# I've got to say
I wasted all your time #

41:28.880 --> 41:30.880
# Honey, honey #

41:30.881 --> 41:33.046
# Where do I go
to fall from... #

41:33.047 --> 41:35.212
You're so beautiful.

41:35.213 --> 41:37.713
Dinner's ready.

41:38.248 --> 41:41.339
You do have an oven, you know.
We can reheat.

41:42.714 --> 41:44.880
# Yeah #

41:44.881 --> 41:48.006
# Now #

41:48.114 --> 41:54.206
# When you work it out,
I'm worse than you #

41:54.315 --> 41:55.614
# Yeah #

41:55.615 --> 42:01.548
# When you work it out,
I want it, too #

42:01.682 --> 42:03.181
# Now #

42:03.182 --> 42:09.046
# When you work out
where to draw the line #

42:09.150 --> 42:17.572
# Your guess is as good
as mine #

42:31.518 --> 42:36.075
# Where do we go?
Nobody knows #

42:37.305 --> 42:43.420
