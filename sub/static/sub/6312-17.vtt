WEBVTT

00:01.360 --> 00:04.466
Sherlock!
I'm heading to the precinct.

00:08.540 --> 00:11.361
Watson, you know Everyone.

00:11.410 --> 00:13.605
Actually, I don't
know anyone.

00:13.640 --> 00:15.198
No, I mean Everyone
with a capital "E."

00:15.240 --> 00:16.309
The hacker collective.

00:16.350 --> 00:19.376
These are six of
theIr members.

00:19.420 --> 00:21.547
And what are they doing
in our living room?

00:21.580 --> 00:23.138
They've come to help
with your clothing drive

00:23.190 --> 00:24.748
for Haven for
the Homeless.

00:24.790 --> 00:27.258
I've just helped them out of a
spot of bother with the NSA,

00:27.290 --> 00:28.382
and they owe me.

00:30.360 --> 00:33.249
That's really great,
but...

00:35.400 --> 00:37.061
Um, what are they doing?

00:37.100 --> 00:39.261
They are giving you
their clothing.

00:39.300 --> 00:40.790
When they help me,
they collect payment

00:40.840 --> 00:42.501
by asking me to
humiliate myself,

00:42.540 --> 00:44.428
so fair's fair,
is it not?

00:47.840 --> 00:51.105
Okay, all of this is
gonna have to be washed.

00:51.150 --> 00:52.742
Yup.

00:52.780 --> 00:54.475
Does your charity
require undergarments?

00:54.520 --> 00:56.488
(door opens, closes)

00:56.520 --> 00:59.455
Better safe than sorry, no?

00:59.490 --> 01:01.378
BELL:
Got one more batch for you.

01:01.420 --> 01:03.388
Oh, great. You can just
put it right there. Thanks.

01:03.430 --> 01:04.727
Mm-hmm.

01:04.760 --> 01:07.490
Who knew cops
could be so generous?

01:07.530 --> 01:08.622
This is the fourth
clothing drive

01:08.660 --> 01:10.161
I_'ve done here
In four years,

01:10.200 --> 01:12.168
and the donations
go up every year.

01:12.200 --> 01:14.191
Oh, parking's all set
for your friend, by the way.

01:14.240 --> 01:16.060
I just hope she brought
a big enough car.

01:16.840 --> 01:19.206
Are those bullet holes?

01:19.240 --> 01:21.572
Yeah, that used to belong
to Sherlock.

01:21.610 --> 01:24.340
Funny, you not telling me
he was dead.

01:24.380 --> 01:25.642
No one shot him.

01:25.680 --> 01:27.648
I think he was using that
in an experiment.

01:27.680 --> 01:30.717
He proved tweed isn't
bulletproof. He must be proud.

01:30.750 --> 01:33.253
Oh, Tammy!

01:33.290 --> 01:35.178
Hey!
Oh. Hey!

01:35.220 --> 01:36.357
I'll be right back.

01:36.390 --> 01:37.584
Mm-hmm.

01:37.630 --> 01:39.495
Joan.

01:39.530 --> 01:41.498
(laughing)

01:41.530 --> 01:42.497
Oh.

01:42.530 --> 01:44.418
Good to see you, too.

01:44.470 --> 01:48.395
Sorry, but someone wrote us
a check today-- a big one.

01:48.440 --> 01:50.135
Five zeroes big.

01:50.170 --> 01:51.467
Really?

01:51.510 --> 01:53.569
Really. And it is
all thanks to you.

01:53.610 --> 01:54.838
What are you talking about?

01:54.880 --> 01:56.370
The guy who
wrote the check,

01:56.410 --> 01:57.604
the guy who just
guaranteed

01:57.650 --> 01:58.844
we can keep Haven
up and running

01:58.880 --> 02:00.677
for at_ least the
next fIve years,

02:00.720 --> 02:03.518
he is a friend
of yours.

02:03.550 --> 02:05.780
VVho?
Morland Holmes.

02:05.820 --> 02:09.529
He... he is a friend
of yours, right?

02:11.260 --> 02:14.149
Yeah, that's a good question.

02:14.200 --> 02:15.849
You're the new guy.

02:15.900 --> 02:19.495
And for the new guy, every
day here starts the same way.

02:19.540 --> 02:20.598
At least in the winter.

02:20.640 --> 02:22.505
(metallic clanking)

02:22.540 --> 02:26.499
Attention, all bums, this is
your 6:00 am. wake-up call!

02:26.540 --> 02:29.509
Time to hit the road!

02:29.550 --> 02:31.506
See, they like the warm air

02:31.550 --> 02:32.949
that comes out
of this grate,

02:32.980 --> 02:35.540
but can't have a bunch
of homeless out front

02:35.580 --> 02:37.548
when the customers
start to show.

02:37.590 --> 02:40.354
Should I go back inside, maybe
get them some of the day-olds?

02:40.390 --> 02:41.652
What, you want
to encourage them?

02:41.690 --> 02:42.725
Hey, buddy.

02:42.760 --> 02:44.625
You deaf?

02:44.660 --> 02:47.652
You don't have to go home,
but you can't stay here.

02:47.700 --> 02:49.622
Hey!

02:49.670 --> 02:52.434
You got five seconds, then I'm
gonna tear that blanket off.

02:52.470 --> 02:54.233
I don't think
it's a blanket.

02:54.270 --> 02:57.239
It's, like, attached
to him, see?

02:57.270 --> 02:59.431
I think it's
a cape.

03:05.980 --> 03:07.777
*

03:13.990 --> 03:15.958
BELL:
Meet the Midnight Ranger.

03:15.990 --> 03:18.925
M.E. puts the time of death
around 11:00 last night.

03:18.960 --> 03:21.758
Body was found a little
before 6:00 this morning.

03:21.800 --> 03:24.667
Took someone seven hours
to find a dead body

03:24.700 --> 03:25.462
dressed like this?

03:25.500 --> 03:27.536
Well, either his cape
fell over him

03:27.570 --> 03:30.459
when he fell, or the person
who shot him tucked him in.

03:30.510 --> 03:31.807
To anyone who
walked by,

03:31.840 --> 03:33.933
he just looked like a homeless
guy trying to stay warm.

03:33.980 --> 03:35.572
Believe it or not,

03:35.610 --> 03:37.498
he wasn't coming home
from a costume party.

03:37.550 --> 03:39.643
These were his work
clothes-- sort of.

03:39.680 --> 03:41.443
He walked a beat
In Greenpomt

03:41.480 --> 03:43.516
almost every night.

03:43.550 --> 03:45.711
Real-life superhero.

03:45.750 --> 03:47.957
One of a subculture of

03:47.990 --> 03:52.290
ordinary men and women
who don costumes to perform acts

03:52.330 --> 03:53.649
of public service.

03:53.700 --> 03:55.622
I'm familiar with
the phenomenon,

03:55.660 --> 03:57.366
though I've never
delved too deeply

03:57.400 --> 03:59.994
into the affairs of the heroes
who operate in New York.

04:00.040 --> 04:01.769
They mostly
just scold litterbugs

04:01.800 --> 04:03.665
and help little old ladies
across the street.

04:03.710 --> 04:05.962
Mm, some of them
fight crime, too.

04:06.010 --> 04:07.432
The Midnight Ranger
liked to hassle

04:07.480 --> 04:08.674
street level
drug dealers.

04:08.710 --> 04:10.803
Even chased down a
purse-snatcher or two.

04:10.850 --> 04:13.444
Well, obviously he got in
over his head last night.

04:13.480 --> 04:15.448
Or someone came
looking for him.

04:15.480 --> 04:17.414
The shooter used
armor-piercmg rounds.

04:17.450 --> 04:19.509
Considering the Midnight
Ranger wore armor,

04:19.560 --> 04:21.289
it's possible
he was targeted.

04:21.320 --> 04:23.754
Maybe by someone he
tangled with in the past.

04:23.790 --> 04:26.623
You keep using his hero name,
the Midnight Ranger.

04:26.660 --> 04:28.457
That's 'cause
I have to.

04:28.500 --> 04:29.819
There wasn't any
ID. on the body.

04:29.870 --> 04:31.622
That's why I called;
thought maybe you could

04:31.670 --> 04:33.297
help figure out his
secret identity.

04:34.670 --> 04:36.706
This is an impressive suit.

04:36.740 --> 04:38.605
Indeed.

04:38.640 --> 04:40.835
If you look closely,
you'll see the button holes,

04:40.880 --> 04:43.542
which attach the cape
to the shoulder armor,

04:43.580 --> 04:44.569
are tailor-made.

04:44.610 --> 04:46.669
Not homemade or factory made.

04:46.720 --> 04:49.075
They're straight-cut
and hand sewn by an expert.

04:49.120 --> 04:51.918
Now, given that the
Midnight Ranger's territory

04:51.950 --> 04:53.554
was Greenpoint,

04:53.590 --> 04:54.784
perhaps you should visit

04:54.820 --> 04:56.788
some of the neighborhood
tailors, dry cleaners.

04:56.830 --> 04:58.752
There might be a seamstress
or a sempster

04:58.790 --> 04:59.791
who knows his real identity.

04:59.830 --> 05:01.627
Watson and I,
meanwhile,

05:01.660 --> 05:05.460
will adjourn to the New York
offices of Superlative Comics.

05:05.500 --> 05:06.364
What for?

05:06.400 --> 05:08.664
Well, unlike
his civic-minded brethren,

05:08.700 --> 05:09.837
our victim

05:09.870 --> 05:12.100
did not come up
with his own

05:12.140 --> 05:13.539
superhero name and costume.

05:13.580 --> 05:14.933
Rather, he assumed the identity

05:14.980 --> 05:18.370
of a character owned
and copyrighted by Superlative.

05:18.410 --> 05:19.718
I know. I used to read

05:19.750 --> 05:21.809
the Midnight Ranger
when I was a kid.

05:21.850 --> 05:24.045
Do you seriously think
this guy got gunned down

05:24.090 --> 05:25.739
by an angry
comic book company?

05:25.790 --> 05:27.712
No, but Superlative
were none too happy

05:27.760 --> 05:29.113
about the infringement,

05:29.160 --> 05:30.855
and they've been
trying to find out

05:30.890 --> 05:32.858
the Midnight Ranger's identity
for well over a year.

05:34.560 --> 05:36.892
So they might know
more about him than we do.

05:36.930 --> 05:38.898
HOLMES: Well, it makes
a certain amount of sense

05:38.930 --> 05:40.966
that our John Doe would emulate
the Midnight Ranger,

05:41.000 --> 05:43.639
as opposed to other heroes
in the Superlative library.

05:43.670 --> 05:45.831
The Ranger has
no real superpowers.

05:45.870 --> 05:47.804
He is simply
an Olympic-level athlete

05:47.840 --> 05:49.546
with an obscenely high IQ

05:49.580 --> 05:51.047
who, for some reason,
remains oblivious

05:51.080 --> 05:53.674
to the lure of the Olympic games
and the Nobel Prize.

05:53.720 --> 05:56.143
He didn't dedicate himself
to crime-fighting, however,

05:56.180 --> 05:57.989
until his fiance, Rebecca
Rogers, was murdered by...

05:58.020 --> 06:00.682
You really think
I don't know the origin

06:00.720 --> 06:02.017
of the Midnight Ranger?

06:03.790 --> 06:05.451
My brother was a geek, remember?

06:05.490 --> 06:07.651
I know the origins of
all of the Superlative heroes.

06:07.700 --> 06:09.565
Really?
Really.

06:11.030 --> 06:13.931
Exposed to theta radiation
by his scientist parents.

06:15.500 --> 06:18.060
Stung by
a radioactive scorpion.

06:18.110 --> 06:21.136
Uh, nuclear power plant
explosion.

06:21.180 --> 06:23.842
In what universe are these
people not all dead from cancer?

06:23.880 --> 06:25.700
When's the last time
you heard from your father?

06:25.750 --> 06:27.069
It's been a few months. Why?

06:27.120 --> 06:28.519
_ MAN:
MISS Watson.

06:28.550 --> 06:30.017
Uh, Mr. Holmes.

06:31.490 --> 06:33.481
Al Baxter. I edit
the Midnight Ranger book.

06:33.520 --> 06:35.784
I was told you have
questions about him.

06:35.820 --> 06:38.459
We do have questions,
just not about your Ranger.

06:38.490 --> 06:41.550
The flesh and blood Midnight
Ranger was shot dead last night.

06:41.600 --> 06:43.818
Unfortunately, the bullets used
were not radioactive,

06:43.870 --> 06:45.690
so he'll be remaining
quite dead.

06:45.730 --> 06:46.936
Oh.

06:46.970 --> 06:49.734
I got no idea
who this guy is.

06:49.770 --> 06:51.863
You got any idea
who this guy is?

06:51.910 --> 06:53.832
I knew something like
this would happen.

06:53.880 --> 06:56.576
As soon as this idiot started
operating a couple years back,

06:56.610 --> 06:57.770
I said to my guys,

06:57.810 --> 06:59.869
we got two
possible outcomes:

06:59.920 --> 07:00.841
he hurts someone

07:00.880 --> 07:02.711
or someone hurts him.

07:02.750 --> 07:03.785
Either way,

07:03.820 --> 07:04.844
it gets us
all the wrong headlines.

07:04.890 --> 07:06.778
At the worst possible time.

07:06.820 --> 07:08.788
What do you mean?
EICHORN: We sent our lawyers

07:08.820 --> 07:10.185
after the real Ranger

07:10.230 --> 07:11.857
because we had to protect
our licensing deals.

07:11.890 --> 07:13.949
But now we're in talks

07:14.000 --> 07:16.491
with a studio about
a major motIon picture.

07:16.530 --> 07:19.738
So we finally get our slice
of that superhero movie cake,

07:19.770 --> 07:21.089
made from layers of money.

07:21.140 --> 07:23.506
For a character whose book
is hardly selling?

07:23.540 --> 07:25.599
This is a reimagining.

07:25.640 --> 07:28.575
A new Midnight Ranger,
relevant to today's society.

07:28.610 --> 07:30.077
Sandy means darker,
more violent.

07:30.110 --> 07:32.772
Could the death of the real
Ranger affect the deal?

07:32.820 --> 07:33.912
It can't help.

07:33.950 --> 07:35.645
But on the plus side,

07:35.680 --> 07:37.238
the picture wouldn't be
in theaters for at least

07:37.290 --> 07:38.746
a couple more years.

07:38.790 --> 07:40.587
Any luck,

07:40.620 --> 07:41.882
this real Ranger mishegas

07:41.920 --> 07:43.785
will be squarely
in our rearview mirror.

07:44.830 --> 07:46.627
You said
you wanted everything

07:46.660 --> 07:47.922
our investigators
turned up.

07:47.960 --> 07:49.222
You got it.

07:49.260 --> 07:51.262
But I'll tell you
right now, it isn't much.

07:51.300 --> 07:52.767
Your dead guy's
real superpower,

07:52.800 --> 07:53.937
turns out,
was being able

07:53.970 --> 07:56.131
to run faster than people
trying to serve him papers.

07:56.170 --> 07:57.967
We got some
blurry pictures,

07:58.010 --> 08:01.901
an idea of where his regular
patrol was, that's it.

08:01.940 --> 08:03.874
We'll take whatever you've got.

08:04.910 --> 08:07.219
Yeah, that's my stitching.

08:07.250 --> 08:09.844
I'd like to show you a picture
of the man who got killed.

08:09.890 --> 08:10.845
You won't see

08:10.890 --> 08:12.551
anything graphic, just the face.

08:12.590 --> 08:13.887
That be okay?

08:13.920 --> 08:15.888
(sighs):
All right. Yeah.

08:20.730 --> 08:22.891
(sighs):
That's him.

08:22.930 --> 08:24.898
That's definitely him.

08:24.930 --> 08:26.898
Do you know his name?

08:26.940 --> 08:30.865
You know, there used to be a lot
of crime in this neighborhood.

08:30.910 --> 08:33.276
Did you know that?

08:33.310 --> 08:37.849
Back in 2010, we were held up
twice in the same month.

08:37.880 --> 08:39.871
Twice.
By the same guy.

08:39.920 --> 08:41.273
Cops never caught him.

08:44.220 --> 08:46.279
I never_saw _
the Ranger In actIon.

08:46.320 --> 08:49.209
I mean, it's not like he drove
around is a Midnight Mobile.

08:49.260 --> 08:51.228
But I'm telling you,

08:51.260 --> 08:53.558
last couple of years,
things got better.

08:53.600 --> 08:55.227
People felt safer.

08:55.260 --> 08:57.262
He didn't want anybody
to know his real name,

08:57.300 --> 08:59.564
so, uh, why should
I tell you?

08:59.600 --> 09:01.989
Because you don't want
the person who did this

09:02.040 --> 09:03.837
to get away with murder.

09:07.910 --> 09:09.639
(sighs)

09:09.680 --> 09:12.979
His name was Danny.
Danny Dalton.

09:13.020 --> 09:15.318
That's the real
Midnight Ranger's name.

09:15.350 --> 09:17.113
I mean,

09:17.150 --> 09:20.051
the real real one, the original,
the one from the comics.

09:20.090 --> 09:23.821
He might as well have told you
his name was Bruce Wayne.

09:23.860 --> 09:25.350
Well, I'm sorry, but that's...

09:25.390 --> 09:28.689
that's the only name
he ever gave me.

09:32.100 --> 09:33.988
(door opens)

09:36.100 --> 09:38.261
Mr. Holmes.

09:39.340 --> 09:41.001
Joan.

09:41.040 --> 09:43.247
To what do I owe the pleasure?

09:43.280 --> 09:44.907
I came to say thank you.

09:44.950 --> 09:46.713
Unless there's another
Morland Holmes

09:46.750 --> 09:49.719
who donated $250,000 to Haven
for the Homeless yesterday.

09:49.750 --> 09:51.741
(speaking Russian)

10:01.730 --> 10:03.789
I must confess,

10:03.830 --> 10:07.095
I was motivated in part
by the American tax system.

10:07.140 --> 10:08.368
It was a good year.

10:08.400 --> 10:10.106
The money
had to go somewhere,

10:10.140 --> 10:11.869
and your charity seemed

10:11.910 --> 10:13.901
a better final destination
than the government.

10:13.940 --> 10:15.271
You want something.

10:15.310 --> 10:16.868
I was going to wait

10:16.910 --> 10:18.377
a decent interval
between the donation

10:18.410 --> 10:19.911
and asking for your help,

10:19.950 --> 10:22.168
but, in fact, I'm in need
of an investigator.

10:22.220 --> 10:24.939
You have in-house investigators.
I do.

10:24.990 --> 10:28.289
But it's the sanctity of
my house that I'm worried about.

10:28.320 --> 10:30.880
What's the problem?

10:30.930 --> 10:32.693
Please.

10:39.130 --> 10:42.099
As you may
or may not know,

10:42.140 --> 10:45.007
oil has been discovered
in the Colombian jungle.

10:45.040 --> 10:46.928
A group
of Chinese investors

10:46.980 --> 10:49.801
hired me to broker a deal
with the Colombian government

10:49.850 --> 10:52.239
to allow for the construction
of several refInerIes.

10:52.280 --> 10:55.078
After a year
of painstaking work,

10:55.120 --> 10:57.816
one of my competitors swooped in

10:57.850 --> 10:59.954
and closed the deal
in a weekend.

10:59.990 --> 11:03.050
And you think someone here
helped them undercut you.

11:03.090 --> 11:07.151
I had a team of ten assisting me
with the negotiations.

11:07.200 --> 11:10.124
Each person had access
to technical specifications,

11:10.170 --> 11:12.229
cost projections,
any number of things

11:12.270 --> 11:16.161
that would make it simple for a
competitor to beat our numbers.

11:16.200 --> 11:19.169
Does anyone jump out at you?

11:19.210 --> 11:22.941
They're a good group.

11:22.980 --> 11:25.403
Each person
was vetted meticulously

11:25.450 --> 11:27.247
before they came to work here.

11:27.280 --> 11:30.181
Isn't it possible
that your competitor

11:30.220 --> 11:32.017
just did a better job than you?

11:32.050 --> 11:33.779
It is.

11:33.820 --> 11:36.050
In fact, nothing
would make me happier

11:36.090 --> 11:37.853
than knowing that

11:37.890 --> 11:40.256
I can trust the ten individuals
In questIon.

11:40.300 --> 11:42.120
Why me?

11:42.160 --> 11:44.060
Why not ask
Sherlock for help?

11:44.100 --> 11:47.467
Sherlock and I are not
on the best of terms at present.

11:50.110 --> 11:52.032
I'll think about it.

11:52.070 --> 11:54.868
If it's a problem...

11:54.910 --> 11:56.741
I do understand.

11:56.780 --> 11:58.270
It's pretty hard
to say no to someone

11:58.310 --> 12:00.119
who just donated
a quarter of a million dollars

12:00.150 --> 12:01.742
to a charity I care about.

12:01.780 --> 12:04.817
Well, that was the
whole point, right?

12:09.220 --> 12:10.881
(door opens)

12:11.990 --> 12:13.321
(door closes)

12:16.000 --> 12:17.524
What's all that?

12:17.570 --> 12:19.526
I wondered if some enlightenment
might be found

12:19.570 --> 12:21.128
in the fictional universe

12:21.170 --> 12:23.161
our Midnight Ranger
took inspiration from.

12:23.210 --> 12:25.337
So I reached out to the
Midnight Ranger fan community,

12:25.370 --> 12:27.099
and, with their help,
I managed to procure

12:27.140 --> 12:28.129
the comic's entire run.

12:30.080 --> 12:32.275
There has to be,
what, 600 issues?

12:32.310 --> 12:34.449
648, to be precise.

12:34.480 --> 12:38.439
Having read the bulk of them,
I confess I do see the appeal.

12:38.490 --> 12:41.152
If you strip away
the silly outfits, square jaws

12:41.190 --> 12:42.828
and skull-sized breasts,

12:42.860 --> 12:45.181
there is a cardinal devotion
to justIce.

12:45.230 --> 12:49.098
The attention to continuity,
however, is laughable.

12:49.130 --> 12:51.894
This is the tenth
issue from the 19405,

12:51.930 --> 12:53.898
and you took it
out of its bag.

12:53.940 --> 12:57.068
Yes._How else _
was I gomg to read It?

12:57.110 --> 12:58.566
(groans)

12:58.610 --> 13:00.999
And you did
all this why?

13:01.040 --> 13:04.077
Over the course of the 80 years
of his derring-do,

13:04.110 --> 13:06.078
the Midnight Ranger has died

13:06.110 --> 13:08.078
five times.

13:08.120 --> 13:10.247
It occurred to me that our
Ranger might have been killed

13:10.290 --> 13:13.851
by an obsessed fan attempting
to recreate a particular death.

13:13.890 --> 13:15.858
And?
Unfortunately,

13:15.890 --> 13:17.118
the deaths in the comics
Involved

13:17.160 --> 13:18.821
being sent back in time,
buried deep underground,

13:18.860 --> 13:22.091
made microscopic,
impersonated by an alien and--

13:22.130 --> 13:24.121
my particular favorite demise--
pushed over a waterfall,

13:24.170 --> 13:25.922
locked in the embrace
of ms nemeSIs.

13:25.970 --> 13:27.289
Hmm.

13:27.340 --> 13:30.400
In comparison, armor-piercing
bullets seem pass.

13:30.440 --> 13:32.101
Speaking of super villains,

13:32.140 --> 13:32.936
you asked about my father today

13:32.980 --> 13:34.436
and then you disappeared
for an hour.

13:34.480 --> 13:35.606
Why do I sense a connection?

13:35.640 --> 13:37.608
Well, because there is one.

13:37.650 --> 13:39.345
He thinks that one of his people

13:39.380 --> 13:41.314
is selling company secrets
to a rival.

13:41.350 --> 13:43.113
He asked me to look into it.

13:43.150 --> 13:44.947
Only you?
Yeah.

13:44.990 --> 13:46.309
He said that you two
were on the outs.

13:46.350 --> 13:48.318
Look, I told him that I'd
have to talk to you about it

13:48.360 --> 13:50.055
before I agreed to help.
(phone ringing)

13:53.500 --> 13:55.024
Hello?

13:55.060 --> 13:57.062
MAN:
Is this Sherlock Holmes?

13:57.100 --> 13:59.022
Who's this?

13:59.070 --> 14:01.231
Someone who can tell you
the Midnight Ranger's real name.

14:03.310 --> 14:05.266
Sorry, you'll have to be
more specific.

14:05.310 --> 14:07.904
Do you mean the Midnight Ranger
from the comic books

14:07.940 --> 14:10.909
_or-or the one who died
In Greenpomt yesterday?

14:10.950 --> 14:13.510
The one who was murdered.

14:13.550 --> 14:15.973
Would you do me the favor
of telling me your name?

14:16.020 --> 14:18.909
I want to talk in person.

14:18.950 --> 14:20.087
Time and a place?

14:20.120 --> 14:21.985
Now.

14:22.020 --> 14:24.022
I'm on your roof.

14:32.030 --> 14:34.032
I'm the Standard-Bearer.

14:35.400 --> 14:38.039
I'm here to help.

14:52.520 --> 14:54.283
You're staring.

14:54.320 --> 14:57.289
Observation must be one of
your superhuman abIIItIes.

14:57.330 --> 14:59.389
I've had masked
visitors before,

14:59.430 --> 15:02.228
but they came either to kill me
or have sex with me.

15:02.260 --> 15:03.989
On one _memorable
occaSIon, both,

15:04.030 --> 15:05.998
but you are my first superhero.

15:06.030 --> 15:08.066
You do make
qUIte an entrance.

15:08.100 --> 15:09.533
The roof-- I
assume you wanted

15:09.570 --> 15:11.538
to establish your
hero credentials.

15:11.570 --> 15:13.538
Lend more weight
to your words.

15:13.580 --> 15:16.276
You don't want people seeing me
ringing your doorbell.

15:16.310 --> 15:20.178
An association between us
could place you In danger.

15:20.220 --> 15:23.280
Your enemies are legion,
I take it.

15:25.650 --> 15:28.153
You know you're gonna have
to take that off

15:28.190 --> 15:30.124
to drink that, right?

15:30.160 --> 15:33.095
It's imperative for my safety

15:33.130 --> 15:35.257
and that of my loved ones
that...

15:35.300 --> 15:38.098
One should never confuse
need with fetish.

15:38.130 --> 15:40.337
You got onto our roof
via the fire escape next door.

15:40.370 --> 15:42.964
Your particular musculature and
ability to make that entrance

15:43.010 --> 15:44.261
indicate expertise
in free running.

15:44.310 --> 15:46.266
But a slight hunch

15:46.310 --> 15:48.335
speaks to a job which involves
frequent bending from the waist.

15:48.380 --> 15:50.746
You smell of organic compounds
redolent of printing solvents.

15:50.780 --> 15:53.112
You work in a print shop,
probably in Astoria,

15:53.150 --> 15:54.310
where,
according to the Internet,

15:54.350 --> 15:56.272
the Standard-Bearer
walks a beat.

15:56.320 --> 15:58.311
Long story short,
your secret identity is,

15:58.350 --> 16:00.489
here, purely notional.

16:00.520 --> 16:02.659
So take off the mask.

16:02.690 --> 16:05.329
Please?

16:13.200 --> 16:15.168
How'd you do all that?

16:15.200 --> 16:17.168
I was bitten
by a radioactive detective.

16:17.210 --> 16:20.179
How did you get my number
and address?

16:20.210 --> 16:23.441
There's... awareness of you

16:23.480 --> 16:25.539
in the community.

16:25.580 --> 16:27.775
The community?

16:27.820 --> 16:30.789
The hero community.

16:30.820 --> 16:33.209
One of your business cards
got around.

16:33.260 --> 16:36.388
Why?

16:36.420 --> 16:39.253
You're someone to call on
as a last resort.

16:39.290 --> 16:41.326
You're with the police,
but you're not police.

16:43.330 --> 16:45.127
Most of us don't like cops.

16:45.170 --> 16:47.138
Depending on the neighborhood,

16:47.170 --> 16:50.560
they can't be trusted
to look out for the little guy.

16:50.610 --> 16:52.703
That's why we do what we do.

16:52.740 --> 16:56.437
So, you said you could tell us
the Midnight Ranger's real name.

16:59.350 --> 17:01.341
It's Mike Stratton.

17:04.420 --> 17:07.287
He was a friend.

17:14.430 --> 17:16.227
Do you know who killed him?

17:16.260 --> 17:17.727
No.

17:17.770 --> 17:21.228
But if it's someone
he crossed paths with before,

17:21.270 --> 17:23.329
_ the name_ will be
In hIs war journals.

17:23.370 --> 17:25.338
They're a log of

17:25.370 --> 17:28.237
everything he did
as the Midnight Ranger.

17:28.280 --> 17:30.271
You'll find them
at his headquarters.

17:40.290 --> 17:41.814
I imagine this is
what it feels like

17:41.860 --> 17:44.351
the_ first time one
steps Into the Batcave.

17:59.410 --> 18:02.174
This must be Mike
Stratton's war journals.

18:04.180 --> 18:06.307
Last night, you asked
ifI had a problem

18:06.350 --> 18:09.410
with you assisting
my father. I do.

18:09.450 --> 18:12.317
Something happen
between you two?

18:12.350 --> 18:15.183
Apart from my entire life? Yeah.

18:15.220 --> 18:16.687
I briefly applied myself

18:16.720 --> 18:19.280
to the shooting
which left him half-stomached.

18:19.330 --> 18:21.127
With no small amount of finesse,

18:21.160 --> 18:23.321
I was able to identify
the triggerman,

18:23.370 --> 18:25.622
a mercenary
named Ruslan Krasnov.

18:25.670 --> 18:28.434
I gave my father his name.

18:28.470 --> 18:31.303
I told him to tread carefully.
He ignored that warning.

18:31.340 --> 18:32.830
What do you mean?

18:32.870 --> 18:34.679
Several weeks ago,
Ruslan Krasnov

18:34.710 --> 18:36.803
went missing
from a Russian prison.

18:36.840 --> 18:39.604
What, you think your father
busted him out?

18:39.650 --> 18:41.618
It was the very definition
of foolhardy.

18:41.650 --> 18:44.619
He may have placed himself in
danger, and if he's in danger,

18:44.650 --> 18:46.345
so is everyone
in his orbit.

18:46.390 --> 18:47.459
My advice is
stay out of his orbit.

18:47.490 --> 18:49.219
What'd you find?

18:49.260 --> 18:51.251
It's a check made out
to Mike Stratton for $1,000.

18:51.290 --> 18:53.155
Okay, so someone wrote him
a check for $1,000.

18:53.200 --> 18:54.690
It's not the amount

18:54.730 --> 18:56.721
that's interesting,
it's the name on the check.

18:56.760 --> 18:58.193
(elevator bell dings)

19:04.840 --> 19:06.933
Mr. Baxter.

19:06.970 --> 19:09.939
You'll be pleased to hear we've
identified the Midnight Ranger.

19:09.980 --> 19:13.472
Turns out he was in your
check register all along.

19:15.380 --> 19:16.847
Please have a seat.

19:20.620 --> 19:23.180
Um...

19:23.230 --> 19:25.551
Mike was my friend.

19:25.590 --> 19:28.297
Yesterday, you and Mr. Eichorn
made him sound like an enemy.

19:28.330 --> 19:31.493
He was Superlative's enemy,
not mine.

19:31.530 --> 19:32.565
Mike approached me

19:32.600 --> 19:34.488
a little over two years ago

19:34.540 --> 19:36.838
and asked my permission to wear
the Midnight Ranger costume

19:36.870 --> 19:39.338
to... fight crime.

19:39.370 --> 19:41.201
'Cause that's what you do
when you want to assume

19:41.240 --> 19:42.798
the mantle of
a copyrighted superhero,

19:42.840 --> 19:45.570
you go to the editor
of that hero's comic book?

19:45.610 --> 19:46.975
Well, I'm not just the editor.

19:47.010 --> 19:48.739
My grandfather
was Morty Stiller.

19:48.780 --> 19:50.987
Morty Stiller, the creator
of the Midnight Ranger?

19:51.020 --> 19:52.578
Yeah.

19:52.620 --> 19:54.986
Here was a guy who was
everything my grandfather

19:55.020 --> 19:56.658
wanted the Midnight Ranger
to be, you know?

19:56.690 --> 19:59.420
He was, um, brave
and honorable and decent.

19:59.460 --> 20:01.826
Someone who just wanted
to make the world better.

20:01.860 --> 20:04.363
The whole thing
was just so, um...

20:04.400 --> 20:05.628
Romantic?

20:05.670 --> 20:07.558
(sighs):
Yeah, I guess.

20:07.600 --> 20:08.999
My grandfather
would have loved it.

20:09.040 --> 20:11.235
A real Midnight Ranger

20:11.270 --> 20:12.430
helping real people.

20:12.470 --> 20:14.609
So, I...
I gave him my blessing.

20:14.640 --> 20:16.835
So this was written
less than a week ago.

20:16.880 --> 20:18.768
Right, well,
the first time we met,

20:20.580 --> 20:22.343
that he needed to take steps
to protect himself.

20:22.380 --> 20:24.712
So I gave him some money
to buy body armor.

20:24.750 --> 20:26.581
After that,

20:26.620 --> 20:28.485
I'd send him a little something
whenever I could,

20:28.520 --> 20:29.748
you know, just to keep him safe.

20:31.530 --> 20:34.328
Look, I...

20:34.360 --> 20:36.453
really wanted to tell you guys

20:36.500 --> 20:40.436
about this yesterday,
but you have to understand,

20:40.470 --> 20:42.836
if Sandy finds out
that I did this...

20:42.870 --> 20:45.430
You'll lose your job?
Well, more than that.

20:45.470 --> 20:47.677
Working here at Superlative,

20:47.710 --> 20:52.875
it's, like, my last connection
to this character.

20:52.910 --> 20:54.844
And my grandfather.

20:57.390 --> 20:58.687
Hey, if it'll help,

20:58.720 --> 21:00.813
I will give you access
to my e-mail accounts.

21:00.860 --> 21:02.589
Yes.

21:02.620 --> 21:05.589
And then you can look at

21:05.630 --> 21:07.518
all of my correspondence
with Mike, and you'll see.

21:09.630 --> 21:11.518
He was my friend.

21:16.500 --> 21:17.637
Hey.

21:17.670 --> 21:19.729
Hey. Thanks.

21:19.770 --> 21:23.342
So, scale of one
to ten, how crazy?

21:23.380 --> 21:26.349
Not crazy.

21:26.380 --> 21:27.779
I mean, not exactly.

21:27.820 --> 21:29.469
I mean, everything
was very organized.

21:29.520 --> 21:31.385
He kept notes like a cop would.

21:31.420 --> 21:32.842
You said he worked
as a security guard?

21:32.890 --> 21:33.754
Part-time-- he was

21:33.790 --> 21:36.088
going to school
to become a social worker.

21:36.120 --> 21:38.782
Guess do-gooding at night
wasn't enough for the guy.

21:38.830 --> 21:40.081
(sighs)

21:40.130 --> 21:41.597
Is that from the lab?

21:41.630 --> 21:43.097
Yeah, the trace evidence unit

21:43.130 --> 21:45.325
I.D.'d a piece of fabric
found at the scene

21:45.370 --> 21:47.930
as a flap torn from a pouch
on a tactical belt.

21:47.970 --> 21:49.961
_ Makes sense-_-
the VIctIm was wearIng one.

21:50.000 --> 21:53.800
He was, but his belt
was intact.

21:53.840 --> 21:56.104
You think the killer was
wearIng a tactIcal belt, too?

21:56.140 --> 21:58.472
There was a struggle
before Mike Stratton was shot.

21:58.510 --> 22:00.341
Maybe he tore that off.

22:02.050 --> 22:04.348
GREGSON:
Hey, there's something

22:04.390 --> 22:06.711
you two need to see.

22:12.760 --> 22:14.057
GREGSON:
This happened in Greenpoint

22:14.100 --> 22:15.897
just a couple of hours ago.

22:15.930 --> 22:17.795
This guy stole a lady's purse,

22:17.830 --> 22:21.038
and this guy chased him down
and got it back.

22:21.070 --> 22:23.561
"The Midnight
Ranger Lives."

22:23.610 --> 22:24.861
Eh.

22:24.910 --> 22:27.060
Obviously, some new nut-job

22:27.110 --> 22:30.034
just got himself a costume
and decided to pick up

22:30.080 --> 22:32.105
where Mike Stratton left off.

22:33.750 --> 22:35.479
Who you calling?

22:35.520 --> 22:37.078
Sherlock.

22:37.120 --> 22:39.588
I think I might know who
the new Midnight Ranger is.

22:39.620 --> 22:42.009
And if I'm right...

22:42.060 --> 22:44.949
he might have
killed the old one.

22:56.700 --> 22:59.066
How'd you find me?

22:59.110 --> 23:00.509
I used everything I know
about you

23:00.540 --> 23:02.508
to find out
the one thing I didn't.

23:02.540 --> 23:03.848
Nice to meet you, Ben.

23:03.880 --> 23:06.474
Why are you here?

23:06.510 --> 23:08.671
My partner and I are
investigating the possibility

23:08.720 --> 23:11.644
that Mike Stratton was murdered
by a fellow superhero.

23:11.690 --> 23:13.419
What?

23:13.460 --> 23:16.884
It seems the killer left a piece
of a tactical belt at the scene.

23:16.920 --> 23:18.478
Would it surprise you to know

23:18.530 --> 23:20.054
that it's the same
brand of belt

23:20.090 --> 23:21.694
that you wear
as the Standard-Bearer?

23:22.900 --> 23:24.822
Lots of heroes have that belt.

23:24.870 --> 23:27.168
Well, let's say that's true.

23:27.200 --> 23:30.431
How many do you suppose want
to be the new Midnight Ranger?

23:36.210 --> 23:39.646
I have to admit, Ben,
looks good on you.

23:46.220 --> 23:49.109
I was trying to honor Mike.

23:49.160 --> 23:51.458
I wanted to show
the person who killed him

23:51.490 --> 23:53.651
that the Midnight Ranger
will never die.

23:53.700 --> 23:54.951
Not him, not the things
he stands for.

23:55.000 --> 23:56.228
_BELL:
It's just funny

23:56.260 --> 23:59.798
how you had your own Midnight
Ranger costume all ready to go.

23:59.830 --> 24:01.764
I didn't have it "ready to go."

24:01.800 --> 24:03.836
I had this costume for years.

24:03.870 --> 24:05.861
I bought it to go

24:05.910 --> 24:07.036
to a comic book convention.

24:07.070 --> 24:09.038
I have costumes
of all my favorIte heroes.

24:09.080 --> 24:12.641
The Midnight Ranger's your
absolute favorite, is he not?

24:12.680 --> 24:14.841
The first thing I noticed at
the print shop was your name.

24:14.880 --> 24:15.972
Ben Garrett.

24:16.020 --> 24:18.682
It reminded me of,
uh, Benji Garrett.

24:18.720 --> 24:20.881
A frequent contributor
to the letters column

24:20.920 --> 24:23.855
in the Midnight Ranger comic
between 2003 and 2009.

24:23.890 --> 24:26.222
My partner's suspicion
that you killed Mike Stratton

24:26.260 --> 24:28.125
suddenly made
a little more sense.

24:28.160 --> 24:30.958
What are you talking about?

24:31.000 --> 24:32.991
Benji mostly heaped
praise on the comic,

24:33.030 --> 24:34.998
but then in 2007, the
Midnight Ranger was revamped.

24:35.040 --> 24:38.203
He became,
uh, more brooding,

24:38.240 --> 24:40.208
more bloodthirsty.

24:40.240 --> 24:42.834
Certain elements of his
backstory, hIs orIgIn story,

24:42.880 --> 24:45.178
were-_- I believe the
term Is-- retconned.

24:45.210 --> 24:47.542
WATSON: Benji didn't
like the changes.

24:47.580 --> 24:48.842
His letters to Superlative

24:48.880 --> 24:50.017
became more and more
ImpaSSIoned,

24:50.050 --> 24:52.018
until he finally
told them

24:52.050 --> 24:54.018
that he was never gonna buy
another one of their comics.

24:54.060 --> 24:55.789
What they did was wrong.

24:55.820 --> 24:57.151
Someone had
to tell them so.

24:57.190 --> 24:58.726
BELL; _
Maybe you dIdn't lIke

24:58.760 --> 25:00.557
what Mike was doing
with the Midnight Ranger.

25:00.600 --> 25:01.999
Maybe you decided
to tell him so.

25:02.030 --> 25:03.964
WATSON: Can you tell
us your whereabouts

25:04.000 --> 25:05.922
between 10:00 pm. and midnight
two nights ago?

25:07.970 --> 25:10.029
I was on patrol.

25:10.070 --> 25:11.298
Did anyone see you?

25:11.340 --> 25:13.604
(sighs)

25:13.640 --> 25:15.608
IfI killed Mike,

25:15.640 --> 25:17.801
why would I have
come to you the other night?

25:17.850 --> 25:19.943
Why would I tell you who he was,
where he lived?

25:19.980 --> 25:21.072
WATSON :
Because you knew

25:21.120 --> 25:22.712
we'd identify him eventually.

25:22.750 --> 25:24.183
You wanted to present yourself
as a friend.

25:24.220 --> 25:26.518
I was a friend! I...

25:29.360 --> 25:31.157
A year ago, I was...

25:31.190 --> 25:33.556
different...

25:33.600 --> 25:35.022
than I am now.

25:35.060 --> 25:35.992
I...

25:36.030 --> 25:37.622
didn't like myself.

25:37.670 --> 25:39.729
I didn't like
the world I lived in.

25:39.770 --> 25:42.034
The news was on.

25:42.070 --> 25:44.937
A girl had been assaulted
in Greenpoint.

25:44.970 --> 25:48.633
The police only had sketches,
and then all of a sudden,

25:48.680 --> 25:49.931
I mean, right there

25:49.980 --> 25:52.949
OI"! my screen. . .

25:52.980 --> 25:55.676
is the Midnight Ranger.

25:57.990 --> 26:01.915
They were talking to him because
he was putting up flyers.

26:01.960 --> 26:05.088
They thought it was funny,
but if they had just listened...

26:08.000 --> 26:11.299
I looked at him and I thought,

26:11.330 --> 26:14.788
why can't I try to be like that?

26:14.840 --> 26:17.365
In the end, I got
a message to him.

26:17.400 --> 26:18.367
I said...

26:18.410 --> 26:21.072
I-I want to be a hero.

26:22.710 --> 26:26.976
"So be a hero," he said.

26:32.650 --> 26:36.017
I couldn't have hurt Mike.

26:38.030 --> 26:41.329
He saved my life.

26:49.440 --> 26:51.806
I'll apply for a warrant
to search his apartment,

26:51.840 --> 26:55.139
see if we can find a tactical
belt with a flap torn off.

26:57.140 --> 26:58.778
What'd you think?

26:58.810 --> 27:02.268
I think I liked him as a suspect
a lot more five minutes ago.

27:02.320 --> 27:04.015
Did you identify
any other suspects

27:04.050 --> 27:06.939
from Mike Stratton's
war journals?

27:06.990 --> 27:09.982
Um, there was one name
that popped up

27:10.020 --> 27:12.750
in more recent entries--
a Renny Mo|Ina.

27:12.790 --> 27:14.223
He's a drug dealer
that set up shop

27:14.260 --> 27:16.319
in Greenpoint Park
a few months ago.

27:16.360 --> 27:18.726
Mike was hassling him
on a regular basis,

27:18.770 --> 27:20.863
interfering with drug deals.

27:20.900 --> 27:22.765
Told him to get out of the park.

27:22.800 --> 27:24.108
There was an entry
from last week

27:24.140 --> 27:27.109
that said things finally
got physical between them.

27:27.140 --> 27:28.698
Physical how?
It wasn't clear.

27:28.740 --> 27:30.230
He didn't document his failures

27:30.280 --> 27:32.248
with as much detail
as hIs VIctorIes.

27:32.280 --> 27:34.214
First thing tomorrow,
we'll pay Mr. Molina a visit.

27:34.250 --> 27:36.047
Actually, I can't.

27:36.080 --> 27:38.048
I have an appointment
with your father.

27:38.090 --> 27:41.150
He sent over some materials,
I want to return them in person.

27:41.190 --> 27:43.408
You decided to heed my advice.

27:43.460 --> 27:46.384
We've got enough going on;
he can find his mole himself.

27:50.500 --> 27:51.990
(sighs)

27:52.030 --> 27:53.429
(sniffs)

27:53.470 --> 27:55.791
It's dangerous counting
your money in this park.

27:55.840 --> 27:57.239
Hear there are
drug dealers about.

27:59.240 --> 28:00.935
Do tell.

28:00.980 --> 28:04.177
Mr. Molina, I, uh...
I work with the police.

28:04.210 --> 28:07.816
The Midnight Ranger
was something of a...

28:07.850 --> 28:09.169
tormentor to you.

28:09.220 --> 28:11.142
Interfering with
your business,

28:11.190 --> 28:13.181
even called the police
on a few occasions,

28:13.220 --> 28:14.357
causing you to run away.

28:14.390 --> 28:15.914
The last time
he came here,

28:15.960 --> 28:17.382
he was the one
who ran away, okay?

28:17.420 --> 28:19.149
Yeah.

28:19.190 --> 28:22.057
Was that, by any chance,
the night of the 12th?

28:22.100 --> 28:23.727
'Cause he wrote about it.

28:23.770 --> 28:25.226
He said there was
a confrontation,

28:25.270 --> 28:27.864
which resulted in the loss
of a piece of equipment.

28:27.900 --> 28:30.061
I'm thinking perhaps
you stole his belt.

28:30.100 --> 28:32.068
His belt?
Yeah.

28:32.110 --> 28:35.079
Well, there was a piece
of one found at the scene

28:35.110 --> 28:36.236
of his murder.

28:36.280 --> 28:38.202
Maybe you stole his,
he replaced it,

28:38.250 --> 28:39.740
and then, for some reason,

28:39.780 --> 28:42.248
you had the original on you
the night you shot him.

28:42.280 --> 28:44.214
(chuckles):
You're crazy, man.

28:44.250 --> 28:46.241
I got nothing
to say to you.

28:48.390 --> 28:50.187
Hello? Captain?

28:50.220 --> 28:53.155
Yeah. Yeah, I found him.

28:53.190 --> 28:55.397
Yeah. No, he doesn't
want to cooperate.

28:56.960 --> 28:59.224
I know. Yeah.

28:59.270 --> 29:00.419
At the precinct?

29:00.470 --> 29:02.438
Yeah. Okay.

29:02.470 --> 29:04.802
Well, he says it's going
to take at least ten men.

29:04.840 --> 29:06.262
Hey.
Hang on.

29:06.310 --> 29:09.507
What? Now he's saying, "Why
don't you come here yourself?"

29:09.540 --> 29:11.405
Hey, man.
Yeah. Hold on.

29:11.450 --> 29:13.941
Yeah, hold on, I'm gonna
have to call you back.

29:13.980 --> 29:15.242
This is the
equipment I took.

29:15.280 --> 29:16.816
Fool dropped it after
I popped him right here.

29:16.850 --> 29:18.112
And I warned him, yo.

29:18.150 --> 29:19.242
I told him to get
out of my face,

29:19.290 --> 29:20.245
but he wouldn't
lIsten.
No.

29:20.290 --> 29:22.053
So when he took off,
I kept it,

29:22.090 --> 29:23.352
as, you know, a trophy.

29:23.390 --> 29:26.120
It's a burner.

29:26.160 --> 29:27.286
Got some
access code, man,

29:27.330 --> 29:29.025
so you can't...
Yeah.

29:30.060 --> 29:32.221
How'd you do that?

29:32.270 --> 29:34.158
So, I suppose
you are gonna tell me

29:36.470 --> 29:37.960
Actually, I won't,
'cause I wasn't.

29:38.010 --> 29:39.500
I was in the ER.
on Chambers Street

29:39.540 --> 29:41.007
with my girl
and her kid.

29:41.040 --> 29:42.302
She thought he got
into my stash,

29:42.340 --> 29:44.308
eaten something
he shouldn't have.

29:44.350 --> 29:47.979
Turned out to be nothing,
but we were there all night.

29:48.020 --> 29:49.214
Well, this has been
very helpful.

29:49.250 --> 29:51.309
I think I know who
I need to speak with next.

29:51.350 --> 29:55.559
Yo, but-but what about with
the captain, all that stuff?

29:55.590 --> 29:57.217
Is that for real?

29:57.260 --> 30:00.229
IfI were you, I'd leave here,
don't come back.

30:00.260 --> 30:03.229
I'm gonna keep this.
Thank you.

30:04.930 --> 30:06.818
MORLAND:
I confess, I didn't expect

30:06.870 --> 30:08.235
to hear back
from you so soon.

30:08.270 --> 30:09.396
Did you review
the materials I sent?

30:09.440 --> 30:11.032
I did.

30:11.070 --> 30:13.163
Every report, every
file, every e-mail.

30:13.210 --> 30:15.337
And?

30:15.380 --> 30:18.349
First, I'd like to talk to
you about Ruslan Krasnov.

30:18.380 --> 30:21.269
Perhaps we should
speak in my office.

30:36.600 --> 30:39.967
I didn't realize you were
aware of Mr. Krasnov.

30:40.000 --> 30:42.195
I wasn't, not until yesterday.

30:42.240 --> 30:44.231
So, two years ago,

30:44.270 --> 30:46.033
he was the one who actually
pulled the trigger, right?

30:46.070 --> 30:47.264
He killed Sabine?

30:47.310 --> 30:50.029
If my son is to be believed,
yes.

30:50.080 --> 30:51.445
According to Sherlock,
you paid someone

30:51.480 --> 30:53.869
to break him out of
a Ru55Ian prIson,

30:53.920 --> 30:55.376
presumably
to torture him,

30:55.420 --> 30:57.513
make him give you the name
of the person who hired him.

30:57.550 --> 30:59.609
Nonsense.

30:59.650 --> 31:01.379
So he's wrong?

31:01.420 --> 31:05.083
You had nothing to do
with Krasnov escaping?

31:05.130 --> 31:07.121
I did not.

31:07.160 --> 31:10.357
Your son thinks we should
stay away from you.

31:14.340 --> 31:15.967
Respectfully, Joan,

31:16.000 --> 31:18.161
I didn't hire you to lecture me

31:18.210 --> 31:19.529
on things
that don't concern you.

31:19.570 --> 31:21.379
Actually, you didn't hire me.

31:21.410 --> 31:23.071
You gave a bunch of money

31:23.110 --> 31:25.078
to a cause that you don't
give a damn about

31:25.110 --> 31:26.907
because you thought
I would be indebted to you.

31:28.280 --> 31:30.009
We deserve to know--

31:30.050 --> 31:31.915
are you starting a war
with someone?

31:31.950 --> 31:34.259
Were my negotiations
with the Colombians

31:34.290 --> 31:37.987
undermined by someone
in my company or weren't they?

31:38.030 --> 31:40.021
No.

31:41.300 --> 31:42.324
There's no mole here.

31:42.360 --> 31:43.429
At least,
there's nothing

31:43.460 --> 31:45.667
in the material that you gave me
that points to one.

31:45.700 --> 31:48.032
As far as I could tell,
you were just outmaneuvered.

31:50.370 --> 31:52.930
That can happen,
you know.

31:52.970 --> 31:54.938
You can lose.

31:59.380 --> 32:02.213
Sherlock Holmes, meet
Sergeant Black from the 7-4.

32:02.250 --> 32:04.343
Nice to meet you.

32:07.320 --> 32:08.617
Hey, um...

32:08.660 --> 32:10.548
this is the number

32:10.590 --> 32:12.581
of your desk phone,
correct?

32:12.630 --> 32:14.393
Yeah, yeah. Why?

32:15.200 --> 32:16.349
Uh, you hear about

32:16.400 --> 32:18.425
the Midnight Ranger murder?

32:18.470 --> 32:19.220
Yeah, the guy in the cape.

32:19.270 --> 32:20.669
Heard he got shot
the other night.

32:20.700 --> 32:21.735
That was his phone.

32:21.770 --> 32:23.431
He used it to alert police

32:23.470 --> 32:25.006
to street crimes
he couldn't handle alone.

32:25.040 --> 32:26.166
Yeah, yeah.

32:26.210 --> 32:29.737
If you look at the log here,
there are exactly 37 calls

32:29.780 --> 32:32.340
to the police,
one from them.

32:32.380 --> 32:34.416
Specifically from you.

32:34.450 --> 32:36.042
What?

32:36.080 --> 32:37.479
BELL:
Yeah, this would've been

32:37.520 --> 32:40.341
a week ago today,
little after 11:00 pm.

32:41.790 --> 32:44.122
I remember now.

32:44.160 --> 32:46.355
The Green Goblin
was trying to help Skeletor

32:46.390 --> 32:48.028
bust out of his cell.

32:48.060 --> 32:50.028
I couldn't get
the Midnight signal up,

32:50.060 --> 32:52.290
so Ijust, I called
the Ranger direct.

32:52.330 --> 32:54.389
You already confirmed
this is your number.

32:54.440 --> 32:56.135
Is this guy for real?

32:56.170 --> 32:57.592
We just want to know
if you knew him.

32:57.640 --> 32:59.335
You know, he kept a low profile,

32:59.370 --> 33:01.133
so anyone who can share
information with us...

33:01.180 --> 33:02.329
Isn't in this room.

33:02.380 --> 33:04.348
Look, excuse me.
I got some real work to do.

33:04.380 --> 33:06.245
Oh, well, perhaps you'd like us

33:06.280 --> 33:08.214
to assume that you were
sharing information with him.

33:08.250 --> 33:09.478
I beg your pardon?

33:09.520 --> 33:10.714
You're a sergeant,
you're often desk-bound.

33:10.750 --> 33:12.479
Difficult to effect
any real change,

33:12.520 --> 33:14.351
though not for
the Midnight Ranger.

33:14.390 --> 33:16.415
Perhaps you thought an alliance
with him was an attractive idea.

33:16.460 --> 33:18.724
Look, no one is accusing you
of anything, okay?

33:18.760 --> 33:21.149
We just want to know
if you knew Mike Stratton.

33:22.200 --> 33:23.098
You do know him.

33:23.130 --> 33:26.327
No, no.
But I know that name.

33:26.370 --> 33:28.133
About a week ago,
they brought a guy in,

33:28.170 --> 33:30.388
10:30 at night, passed out
behind the wheel of his car.

33:30.440 --> 33:33.739
It was parked,
but it was still a DWI.

33:33.770 --> 33:36.330
He used my phone to call
his friend for bail,

33:36.380 --> 33:38.371
and his friend's name
was Stratton.

33:38.410 --> 33:41.447
You remember the name
of the guy who got collared?

33:41.480 --> 33:43.368
Uh, Baxter.
Baxter something.

33:43.420 --> 33:44.614
Al Baxter?

33:44.650 --> 33:45.719
Yeah.
You should talk to him.

33:45.750 --> 33:47.183
We did, twice.

33:47.220 --> 33:48.448
You ask him
about his gun?

33:48.490 --> 33:49.752
We weren't aware
he owned one.

33:49.790 --> 33:52.486
He had a permit to carry
a .45 right in his wallet.

33:52.530 --> 33:54.725
What kind of gun
was used in the homicide?

33:54.760 --> 33:56.421
A .45.

33:57.500 --> 33:59.229
(elevator bell dings)

34:01.470 --> 34:03.438
I heard about the second
Midnight Ranger

34:03.470 --> 34:05.199
a little while ago.

34:05.240 --> 34:06.502
Please tell me
there's not a third.

34:06.540 --> 34:08.178
Actually, Mr. Eichorn,

34:08.210 --> 34:09.404
we're here to speak
with Al Baxter.

34:09.440 --> 34:10.577
Is he around?

34:10.610 --> 34:13.670
No, he's... working from home.

34:13.710 --> 34:15.519
You hesitated. Why?

34:15.550 --> 34:17.541
"Working from home"
is usually code

34:17.580 --> 34:20.344
for "too hungover
to come into the office."

34:20.390 --> 34:22.585
Why do you want to talk to him?

34:22.620 --> 34:25.828
God hates the Midnight Ranger.

34:25.860 --> 34:27.418
I don't know why.

34:27.460 --> 34:29.724
He just does.

34:29.760 --> 34:31.762
So the fact
that a trusted employee

34:31.800 --> 34:34.360
shot a man dressed up
as the Midnight Ranger

34:35.870 --> 34:39.465
_ Because Al Baxter
Is the anngest guy I know.

34:39.510 --> 34:41.603
I didn't hire him by choice.

34:41.640 --> 34:43.278
It was the
publisher's idea.

34:43.310 --> 34:44.607
She thought it would be fun

34:44.650 --> 34:46.845
bringing in the grandson
of the Ranger's creator

34:46.880 --> 34:48.677
to edit the_
Ranger comIc.

34:48.720 --> 34:50.608
Course, she didn't have
to work with him every day.

34:50.650 --> 34:52.618
She didn't have
to put up with his crap.

34:52.650 --> 34:53.617
Define "crap."

34:53.650 --> 34:55.686
Back in the '40s,

34:55.720 --> 34:57.779
Superlative basically
screwed Morty Stiller

34:57.820 --> 34:59.754
out of his rights
to the character.

34:59.790 --> 35:01.496
That's how the companies

35:01.530 --> 35:03.498
did business in those days,
but Baxter

35:03.530 --> 35:04.519
never shut up
about it.

35:04.570 --> 35:06.526
Always complaining
about

35:06.570 --> 35:08.492
how rich he and his family
should be,

35:08.540 --> 35:10.496
how the rest of us wouldn't even
be here without his granddad.

35:10.540 --> 35:14.476
No one in the bullpen
could stand him.

35:14.510 --> 35:16.478
Well, we found
multiple indications

35:16.510 --> 35:18.705
that Mike Stratton
could stand him,

35:18.750 --> 35:21.241
and the two of them were,
in fact, good friends.

35:21.280 --> 35:23.544
Baxter probably loved

35:23.580 --> 35:25.787
that the guy was causing
headaches for the company.

35:25.820 --> 35:27.515
Then why shoot him?

35:27.550 --> 35:30.849
Maybe he wanted to screw up
the Midnight Ranger movie deal.

35:30.890 --> 35:33.154
A week ago,
Baxter found out

35:33.190 --> 35:34.657
that everyone from editorial

35:34.700 --> 35:37.498
was having dinner
with the studio execs.

35:37.530 --> 35:38.690
Everyone except him.

35:38.730 --> 35:40.527
So he wasn't invited?

35:40.570 --> 35:43.164
Last thing we needed was
him crying into his coffee

35:43.200 --> 35:45.668
about how he should be
getting his cut.

35:45.710 --> 35:48.634
He threw a tantrum.
He stormed out of here.

35:48.680 --> 35:50.671
Probably went straight to a bar.

35:50.710 --> 35:52.507
_ BELL:
Was thIs, by any chance,

35:52.550 --> 35:53.869
the night of the 13th?

35:53.910 --> 35:55.343
Sounds right.

35:55.380 --> 35:56.916
Same night
he got that DWI.

35:56.950 --> 35:58.747
EICHORN: The point is,
the Stratton kid,

35:58.790 --> 36:01.213
the real Ranger, he got killed

36:01.260 --> 36:02.579
a stone's throw
from the restaurant.

36:02.620 --> 36:03.416
What restaurant?

36:03.460 --> 36:04.722
The one we took
the mOV|e guys to.

36:04.760 --> 36:06.352
Zona Rosa.

36:06.390 --> 36:07.880
I didn't realize
how close we were

36:07.930 --> 36:09.659
until I saw it
in the paper the other day.

36:09.700 --> 36:11.520
So you're saying
the dinner took place

36:11.570 --> 36:12.798
the same night
Mike Stratton was killed?

36:12.830 --> 36:15.958
Same night.
And less than 500 feet away.

36:16.000 --> 36:17.558
So what are
the chances that, uh,

36:17.600 --> 36:19.909
Mr. Baxter comes in today,
despite his hangover?

36:19.940 --> 36:22.977
Depends how drunk he got.

36:23.010 --> 36:24.807
But he might still come in?

36:24.850 --> 36:26.670
Sure. Why?

36:34.590 --> 36:35.659
(fire alarm blaring)

36:35.690 --> 36:37.487
What the hell
did you do that for?

36:37.520 --> 36:40.284
Quickest way to evacuate your
offices and draw the authorities

36:40.330 --> 36:41.558
to the building.

36:41.600 --> 36:43.955
If Mr. Baxter decides to come
to work today, we don't want you

36:44.000 --> 36:46.560
and your staff being here.
Why not?

36:46.600 --> 36:48.636
I don't think he planned to kill
Mike Stratton the other night.

36:48.670 --> 36:49.932
I think he planned to kill

36:49.970 --> 36:50.959
everyone except for
Mike Stratton.

36:56.840 --> 36:57.807
(knocks)

36:57.840 --> 36:58.807
Hello? Hello?

36:58.850 --> 36:59.805
(over speakers):
Hello?

36:59.850 --> 37:02.341
Is anyone in there?

37:02.380 --> 37:04.382
Been here for
almost an hour now.

37:09.390 --> 37:10.618
(phone chimes)

37:12.630 --> 37:14.450
Marcus?
Yeah.

37:14.500 --> 37:16.491
I'll_te_ll the
captaIn It's tIme.

37:23.400 --> 37:25.402
(knocks)

37:25.440 --> 37:26.998
Oh, Mr. Holmes.

37:29.010 --> 37:31.308
Mr. Baxter, have a seat.

37:31.350 --> 37:33.306
(clears throat)

37:33.350 --> 37:35.341
Your captain called me here.

37:35.380 --> 37:38.588
They said that they identified
a suspect in Mike's murder--

37:38.620 --> 37:41.487
someone I may
or may not recognize.

37:41.520 --> 37:45.479
So my colleague, Detective Bell,
just found a virtual arsenal

37:45.530 --> 37:46.929
in the basement of your home.

37:46.960 --> 37:50.350
Wh-What are you...?
Wait, is this a trick?

37:50.400 --> 37:53.369
Did you bring me here so that
you could search my place? Why?

37:53.400 --> 37:54.435
(chuckles)

37:54.470 --> 37:56.938
Yeah, I got some guns.

37:56.970 --> 37:58.699
So what? They're all registered.

37:58.740 --> 38:03.006
I ask you, is there anything
more quintessentially American

38:03.040 --> 38:05.508
than being gunned down
in a place that you're meant

38:05.550 --> 38:07.006
to feel safe?

38:07.050 --> 38:10.417
Sometimes I think it should be
on US currency.

38:10.450 --> 38:12.748
Most of your ilk
do themselves in.

38:12.790 --> 38:17.409
Of course, that is
after the deed has been done.

38:17.460 --> 38:19.781
But you were stopped before
you could even get started,

38:19.830 --> 38:20.956
weren't you?

38:20.990 --> 38:23.390
Foiled by a caped crusader.

38:23.430 --> 38:25.466
I don't know
what you're talking about.

38:25.500 --> 38:27.525
You and Mike Stratton
were In communIcatIon;

38:27.570 --> 38:28.969
that's not in question.

38:29.000 --> 38:32.436
And at some point,
perhaps whilst drunk,

38:32.470 --> 38:35.405
you made the depths of your
hatred for Superlative Comics

38:35.440 --> 38:37.579
frighteningly and
abundantly clear.

38:37.610 --> 38:39.874
I'm not sure whether you
told him that you intended

38:39.910 --> 38:43.471
to shoot as many of your
coworkers as you possibly could,

38:43.520 --> 38:45.511
but you did give him
cause for concern.

38:45.550 --> 38:47.814
He knew about the dinner
you had been excluded from.

38:47.850 --> 38:52.423
He went there to make sure
you didn't do anything stupid.

38:52.460 --> 38:55.725
So imagine his horror when
you arrive armed to the teeth.

38:55.760 --> 38:58.126
(sighs)

38:58.160 --> 39:00.890
You got quite an imagination;
you should work in comics.

39:00.930 --> 39:05.867
This was found
near his body.

39:05.910 --> 39:09.676
At first, we thought it was torn
from the belt of another hero.

39:09.710 --> 39:11.473
But it wasn't.

39:11.510 --> 39:13.148
Tactical belts aren't made
for do-gooding,

39:13.180 --> 39:14.738
they're made
for people with guns.

39:14.780 --> 39:16.475
They're meant to carry
extra ammunition.

39:16.520 --> 39:18.715
Before you shot Mike,
there was a struggle,

39:18.750 --> 39:20.081
and he ripped this
from your belt.

39:20.120 --> 39:22.554
It was a coincidence,
an armored man being shot

39:22.590 --> 39:23.887
by armor-piercing bullets.

39:23.920 --> 39:25.729
They weren't
meant for him.

39:25.760 --> 39:28.558
No. They were meant
for your tormentors

39:28.600 --> 39:30.693
at Superlative Comics.

39:30.730 --> 39:32.664
You wanted to be able
to shoot through furniture,

39:32.700 --> 39:34.895
you wanted to be able to shoot
through other people,

39:34.940 --> 39:37.932
through anything and everything
that stood between you and them.

39:39.740 --> 39:42.732
I think you've told me precisely
two things that were true.

39:42.780 --> 39:46.841
One, that you admired
and appreciated

39:46.880 --> 39:50.111
Mike's dedication to
the Midnight Ranger's ideals,

39:50.150 --> 39:53.085
and secondly,
that Mike was your friend.

39:54.660 --> 39:56.855
So why don't you do
the right thing now.

39:56.890 --> 40:00.451
Why don't you make it clear
that your friend

40:00.490 --> 40:02.958
didn't die a silly man
in a silly costume.

40:03.000 --> 40:05.127
Hmm?

40:05.170 --> 40:07.889
And make it clear
that he died a hero.

40:11.540 --> 40:12.939
I... (sobs)

40:12.970 --> 40:15.530
I never shot anybody before.

40:15.580 --> 40:17.536
(sniffles)

40:17.580 --> 40:19.070
I saw Mike laying there,

40:19.110 --> 40:22.375
I realized I couldn't do that
to anybody else.

40:26.250 --> 40:27.615
What's all that?

40:27.650 --> 40:29.208
It's a little light reading

40:29.260 --> 40:30.887
for our friend
Ben Garrett,

40:30.920 --> 40:32.785
aka Benji Garrett,
aka The Standard-Bearer,

40:32.830 --> 40:34.525
aka the new Midnight Ranger.

40:34.560 --> 40:37.597
I e-mailed him about the
resolutIon of our case.

40:37.630 --> 40:39.120
Despite Mike Stratton's murder,
he's still intent

40:39.170 --> 40:40.762
on remaining a hero.

40:40.800 --> 40:42.734
And you thought since you can't
change his mind...

40:42.770 --> 40:45.466
I would_ loan him _
some materIals that mIght

40:45.510 --> 40:48.604
hone his observational skills,
help him know a threat

40:48.640 --> 40:49.629
when he sees one.

40:49.680 --> 40:51.568
That's sweet.

40:51.610 --> 40:53.999
Makes me want
to buy you a cape.

40:54.050 --> 40:56.018
All right, I'm going out
for a little while.

40:56.050 --> 40:57.677
Being fitted
for your own costume?

40:57.720 --> 40:59.483
I'm having dinner with a friend.

40:59.520 --> 41:00.589
See you later.

41:02.790 --> 41:04.781
*

41:14.270 --> 41:16.033
WATSON:
Emil Kurtz?

41:17.740 --> 41:19.105
Do I know you?

41:19.140 --> 41:21.529
We have a friend in common:
Morland Holmes.

41:21.580 --> 41:22.569
Oh. Well, nice to meet you.

41:22.610 --> 41:23.599
Morland asked me

41:23.640 --> 41:25.847
to find a mole in his office.

41:25.880 --> 41:28.769
Someone who undermined a deal
to build refineries in Colombia.

41:30.120 --> 41:32.281
In other words,
he asked me to find you.

41:32.320 --> 41:34.584
What?

41:34.620 --> 41:36.110
You collect jazz records.

41:36.160 --> 41:38.685
A week before Morland's deal
fell apart,

41:38.730 --> 41:42.552
you sent a few very long e-mails
to someone named VinylVenue43.

41:42.600 --> 41:44.921
He was offering to sell you
some rare albums;

41:44.970 --> 41:46.597
you wanted a better deal.

41:46.630 --> 41:48.689
Do you know
what a Vigenre cipher is?

41:48.740 --> 41:50.867
It's a form
of encryptIon

41:50.900 --> 41:52.765
that allows a person
to hide messages

41:52.810 --> 41:54.698
inside regular texts.

41:54.740 --> 41:57.573
You weren't looking
to buy any records.

41:57.610 --> 41:59.271
You were sharing information
with the competition.

42:02.720 --> 42:04.119
What do you want?

42:04.150 --> 42:07.688
Same thing
that VinylVenue43 did.

42:09.720 --> 42:12.280
A mole inside
Morland Holmes' office.
