WEBVTT

00:00.680 --> 00:01.569
you're leaving town

00:01.580 --> 00:02.710
Just for one day.

00:02.719 --> 00:04.260
I'm not moving away.

00:04.270 --> 00:05.730
Why are you suddenly
running up to berkeley

00:05.740 --> 00:08.160
I told you.There is
a residential facility

00:08.170 --> 00:10.440
that provides housing
for cancer patients.

00:10.450 --> 00:12.360
I'm going to take a tour,get some ideas.

00:12.370 --> 00:14.000
I see.And this has
nothing to do with roger

00:14.010 --> 00:15.290
- Roger who-
Roger--you know,

00:15.300 --> 00:17.550
the one,the architect with the wife.

00:17.560 --> 00:20.360
You know,nora,it's okay if you want
to be upset that you broke up with him.

00:20.370 --> 00:22.070
I'm not upset about roger.

00:22.080 --> 00:25.060
Well,you're upset about something,honey.

00:25.220 --> 00:26.930
Okay,fine.

00:28.010 --> 00:29.750
- You want to know where I'm going
- Yeah.

00:31.450 --> 00:33.730
- To see ryan.
- Ryan

00:33.740 --> 00:35.940
- Ryan lafferty
- He called me.

00:35.950 --> 00:39.250
George told him william is his
father,his biological father.

00:39.260 --> 00:40.400
I mean,george is his father.

00:40.410 --> 00:41.390
George raised him.

00:41.400 --> 00:43.240
But the point is,the kid's upset.

00:43.250 --> 00:44.450
He needs someone to fill in the blanks.

00:44.460 --> 00:45.520
He needs to talk to me.

00:45.530 --> 00:47.110
What happened to all of your misgivings

00:47.120 --> 00:50.960
He called me ten times and hung up before
he had the nerve to say anything to me.

00:50.970 --> 00:52.190
- He's upset.
- Right.

00:52.210 --> 00:54.500
So you're gonna go up
there and rescue him.

00:54.510 --> 00:56.170
I really don't need
your sarcasm right now.

00:56.180 --> 00:58.310
Well,I'm sorry,but I-I
just am trying to understand

00:58.320 --> 01:00.510
what it is that you think you
can accomplish by going up there.

01:00.520 --> 01:03.770
I don't know he needs
to talk to someone.

01:03.780 --> 01:05.360
William isn't exactly available.

01:05.370 --> 01:07.830
Yeah,but it's william's
mess that you're cleaning up.

01:08.210 --> 01:10.000
Yes,I know.

01:10.010 --> 01:14.480
And I didn't ask for it,but
ryan reached out to me.

01:14.490 --> 01:15.790
I'm not going to ignore him.

01:15.800 --> 01:17.370
You don't even know this boy,nora.

01:17.380 --> 01:18.460
You don't know what he wants.

01:18.470 --> 01:22.240
No,I don't know him,but I know
he's a sophomore at berkeley.

01:22.250 --> 01:24.070
He's about to take his final exams.

01:24.080 --> 01:28.860
He probably wants good grades and
a cute girlfriend or boyfriend.

01:31.500 --> 01:35.350
- Aren't you the least bit curious
- No,I'm not.

01:35.770 --> 01:37.680
I am.

01:37.850 --> 01:39.460
I know.

01:39.680 --> 01:41.650
I hope you know what you're doing.

01:47.640 --> 01:50.250
Okay,you actually told kitty
you were running for governor

01:50.260 --> 01:54.610
I didn't so much tell her
as agree when she guessed.

01:54.620 --> 01:56.700
Okay,and she didn't say anything

01:56.710 --> 01:58.170
She said she needed to think about it.

01:58.180 --> 02:01.120
- What's that-
Th--um,oh.

02:01.130 --> 02:02.580
Uh,washington standard
wants a quote about

02:02.590 --> 02:05.020
the economic stimulus
package on californians.

02:05.030 --> 02:06.320
What--what
did she do then

02:06.330 --> 02:08.919
She went to bed,and she was
still asleep when I left.

02:08.930 --> 02:11.230
I hope you told her I was under
strict orders not to say anything.

02:11.240 --> 02:12.350
It didn't come up.This seems good.

02:12.360 --> 02:13.460
Yeah,this seems good.

02:13.470 --> 02:16.110
The whole kitty siation--
a ticking time bomb.

02:16.120 --> 02:18.160
Would you stop She's processing it.

02:18.170 --> 02:19.830
And this is not some big revelation.

02:19.840 --> 02:22.000
This is something that she
knows I've been wanting.

02:22.010 --> 02:23.710
- She
- ah,no,no.

02:24.030 --> 02:26.450
Just go take that to wendy.

02:29.220 --> 02:31.130
incoming.Incoming.

02:32.990 --> 02:33.760
- Oh,hi.Hi.
- Hi.

02:33.770 --> 02:35.810
- I didn't see you out there.
- We made eye contact,kevin.

02:35.820 --> 02:37.520
- We did
- Kevin,are you hiding from me

02:37.530 --> 02:39.210
Subtle.

02:39.720 --> 02:43.010
So...what--what--
what--what's going on

02:43.540 --> 02:45.050
Oh,oh,oh.

02:45.060 --> 02:47.220

02:47.230 --> 02:50.940

ggy suestions,I have plenty.

02:51.440 --> 02:52.850
Great,great.

02:52.860 --> 02:57.730
Look,um,I know you and robert talked
about the whole governor thing.

02:57.740 --> 03:00.990
I just wanted you to know that I
was under strict orders not to--

03:01.000 --> 03:04.880
it's fine.I would have done the same
thing if I had been in your position.

03:06.030 --> 03:07.600
- You're not here to yell at me
- No,no.

03:07.610 --> 03:09.140
I'm here to get some video clips fr

03:09.160 --> 03:10.900
red,white & blue off of my computer.

03:10.910 --> 03:12.790
Well,actually,you know
what It's your computer now.

03:12.800 --> 03:14.250
Oh,that's great.What for

03:14.260 --> 03:15.320
I told you twice.

03:15.330 --> 03:17.630

barbara whitaker from the times.

03:17.640 --> 03:18.830
Oh,well,listen.

03:20.120 --> 03:21.370

03:21.380 --> 03:23.610
for the deforestation of the planet.

03:23.620 --> 03:26.090
Listen,if,um,she needs an interview,

03:26.100 --> 03:28.150
I'm--I'm happy to give her
a quote about how lucky I am.

03:28.160 --> 03:29.250
And he is.

03:29.260 --> 03:30.360
I-I mean,I am.

03:30.370 --> 03:32.710

very--so,so lucky.

03:32.720 --> 03:34.280

03:34.290 --> 03:37.840

03:56.960 --> 03:59.480
You know,sometimes how you--
you accidentally disable it.

03:59.490 --> 04:01.130
There's that--there's
that button on the side.

04:01.140 --> 04:02.270

No,no,no.I-I-I

06:36.790 --> 06:38.210
I don't want to intrude.

06:38.220 --> 06:40.280
It's okay,really.

06:41.000 --> 06:44.160
Thing is,I don't get
off until 300 today,so...

06:44.260 --> 06:45.440
well,that's okay.

06:45.450 --> 06:47.830
I-I don't have anything else planned.

06:48.100 --> 06:49.460
Okay.

06:49.550 --> 06:52.750
Well,can I get you a
coffee,uh,or a latte or something

06:52.760 --> 06:55.360
Oh,coffee--
black coffee.

07:07.260 --> 07:08.770
hey.

07:09.490 --> 07:11.050
Wh-what are you doing
lurking outside my door

07:11.060 --> 07:13.080
Hi,um...

07:13.370 --> 07:15.120
so kitty did that
interview this morning,

07:15.130 --> 07:16.590
and the times sent
some of her quotes over,

07:16.600 --> 07:19.170
and they were just wondering
if you'd care to comment.

07:19.180 --> 07:22.550
You know the whole ticking
time bomb thing I talked abou--

07:22.560 --> 07:24.720
I mean,this isn't,you know...

07:24.730 --> 07:26.940
it's--this is a cherry
bomb in someone's locker.

07:26.950 --> 07:27.930
Let me see it.

07:27.940 --> 07:30.950
Um,I'm pretty sure
they're out of context.

07:30.970 --> 07:32.750
I mean,you know,once
it's put into the profile,

07:32.760 --> 07:35.700
it'll--it'll make
a lot more sense.

07:36.740 --> 07:39.300
- I doubt it.
- I have crafted some responses,

07:39.310 --> 07:43.270
you ow,the kind that we can
just spin into kitty being kitty.

07:44.710 --> 07:45.700
Just kill it.

07:45.710 --> 07:47.630
Ki--ki--uh,excuse
me

07:47.640 --> 07:48.260
Kill the story.

07:48.270 --> 07:49.570
That's a little extreme.

07:49.580 --> 07:50.980
Maybe you'd want to talk to kitty first.

07:50.990 --> 07:52.920
After this meeting,I'll talk to kitty.

07:52.930 --> 07:55.650
You take care of that.

07:59.180 --> 08:00.970
Uh,re,it's on me.

08:00.980 --> 08:02.960
I don't know if you like
apple fritters or not,but...

08:02.970 --> 08:03.980
thank you.That's really nice of you.

08:03.990 --> 08:05.250
Oh,and I found someone
to cover my shift,

08:05.260 --> 08:06.960
so I should be done really soon.

08:06.970 --> 08:08.650
Great,well,that's
fine.Just take your time.

08:08.660 --> 08:10.470
Okay.

08:12.820 --> 08:14.780
He brought me an apple fritter.

08:14.790 --> 08:16.610
He makes apple fritters

08:16.620 --> 08:19.870
No,he--he works here
at a coffeehouse.

08:19.880 --> 08:22.080
He's putting himself through college.

08:22.090 --> 08:23.350
I think that's very impressive.

08:23.360 --> 08:25.200
Look,I'm gonna pick you
up tonight at the airport,

08:25.210 --> 08:27.850
we'll have dinner,and then you'll
fill me in on everything,okay

08:27.860 --> 08:28.930
I'm not coming home tonight.

08:28.940 --> 08:30.380
What do you mean you're not
coming home What happened

08:30.390 --> 08:32.640
We haven't even had a moment to
sit down and talk to each other.

08:32.650 --> 08:33.909
I-was prepared forhis.

08:33.919 --> 08:35.690
I-I got a room at
a bed-and-brethat

08:35.700 --> 08:38.210
I knew it I knew you
would get entangled.

08:38.220 --> 08:39.470
I'm not entangled.

08:39.480 --> 08:40.299
You're not entangled

08:40.309 --> 08:41.809
You just extended your trip,nora.

08:41.820 --> 08:43.990
Saul...gotta go.

08:44.000 --> 08:45.150
well,my replacement showed up.

08:45.160 --> 08:47.290
- I'm done.
- Great.

08:52.550 --> 08:55.020
- so...
- so...

08:57.090 --> 08:59.730
I'm really sorry if I was
rude to you when you came in.

08:59.740 --> 09:02.570
- That's all right.
- It's not every day you meet your...

09:02.980 --> 09:04.260
whatever I am.

09:04.280 --> 09:06.200
My father's widow.

09:06.210 --> 09:09.250
Your biological father's widow.

09:09.260 --> 09:11.030
Yes.

09:11.060 --> 09:13.550
Yeah,um,my daughter
kitty is adopting a baby,

09:13.560 --> 09:17.160
so we're all very aware that your real
parents are the ones who raise you.

09:17.170 --> 09:18.920
ReallyBecause I'm feeling

09:18.930 --> 09:21.610
kind of caught in the
middle of all that right now.

09:21.620 --> 09:23.660
Yeah,I'll bet.

09:25.490 --> 09:27.380
Ryan,um...

09:27.390 --> 09:29.340
I hope this is all right.

09:31.440 --> 09:36.280
I brought you some pictures I
thought maybe you'd like to look at.

09:37.400 --> 09:38.870
Well...

09:38.880 --> 09:41.370
now then that would make
it all real,wouldn't it

09:42.260 --> 09:43.620
Yeah.

09:47.270 --> 09:49.600
- So this is him.
- Yes.

09:49.610 --> 09:51.680
That's william.

09:53.630 --> 09:54.900
God.This is so weird.

09:54.910 --> 09:59.340
He's--he's--he's sort of
exactly how I pictured him.

10:02.020 --> 10:06.030
- Did you know about my mom
- No.I didn'T.

10:06.410 --> 10:08.540
So how did you find out

10:08.550 --> 10:10.650
that's a long story.

10:10.990 --> 10:12.980
That's okay.

10:21.740 --> 10:22.630
- Rebecca,hey.
- Hey,

10:22.640 --> 10:25.000
I-I was just actually
walking down hudson,and,um,

10:25.010 --> 10:28.740
I saw the sign,so I thought
I'd stop in and say hi,but...

10:28.750 --> 10:29.720
unless you're busy,I can...

10:29.730 --> 10:32.190
no,no,a-actually,uh,it's
perfect timing.

10:32.200 --> 10:33.790
I cou--I could
use your help.

10:33.800 --> 10:35.360
Oh,cool.

10:35.370 --> 10:39.120
Yeah.Would you,um,would
you hold that up for me

10:39.130 --> 10:41.140
Yeah,sure.

10:41.520 --> 10:43.200
Thanks.

10:43.310 --> 10:46.010
- Oh,wow,this is amazing.
- Oh,thanks.

10:46.020 --> 10:47.000
- Is it yours
- Yeah.

10:47.010 --> 10:49.340
I took that about a month ago.

10:52.970 --> 10:54.810
- you can get that if you want.
- No,no,it's okay.

10:54.820 --> 10:57.630
It's probably not important.

10:58.390 --> 10:59.840
all right,thanks.

10:59.850 --> 11:01.920
Great.Thank you.

11:05.570 --> 11:07.900
oh,and,you know,I-I was in
such a daze this morning,

11:07.910 --> 11:11.740
I'm sorry I forgot to say thanks
for letting me stay with you.

11:11.750 --> 11:12.690
Well,you don't have to thank me.

11:12.700 --> 11:15.670
You're,uh,you're my kid,right

11:15.680 --> 11:19.630
Um,so,uh,what do you think of this one

11:19.650 --> 11:21.740
Um,it's nice.

11:21.750 --> 11:24.220
It's nice all right,got it.

11:24.770 --> 11:26.980
But,I mean,still,we don't have,you know,

11:26.990 --> 11:29.770
your average
father-daughter relationship.

11:30.830 --> 11:31.730
No,we don'T.

11:31.740 --> 11:34.750
I mean,I'm sure you didn't appreciate me
just showing up on your doorstep like that.

11:34.760 --> 11:39.170
Well,I mean,I-I-I can't say you were
the first person I was expecting to see.

11:39.730 --> 11:41.160
Thought I was an angry ex-lover

11:41.170 --> 11:43.680
The thought did cross my mind.

11:43.890 --> 11:45.860
Speaking of which,uh,how's your mom

11:45.870 --> 11:47.870
What does she think about you being here

11:48.170 --> 11:50.070
She doesn't know.

11:50.880 --> 11:51.830
Ah.Got it.

11:51.840 --> 11:54.790
No,but we've actually been
getting along great recently.

11:55.170 --> 11:57.880
- Seriously.
- I believe you.

12:00.120 --> 12:01.540
So,um...how's she doing

12:01.550 --> 12:03.390
Does she still hate me

12:03.400 --> 12:04.620
No,she doesn't hate you.

12:04.630 --> 12:07.840
I mean,she knows that you left so I
could continue to pretend to be a walker.

12:07.850 --> 12:11.070
But now,you know,they
all know that I'm not.

12:11.080 --> 12:12.000
- Seriously
- Yeah.

12:12.010 --> 12:14.980
- Since when
- Um,since shortly after you left.

12:15.890 --> 12:18.830
So do you still see them,the walkers

12:20.190 --> 12:21.200
well,that's a funny story.

12:21.210 --> 12:24.100
Uh,well,justin and I,you
know,were f-friends,

12:24.110 --> 12:27.840
and then found out we
weren't related,so,um...

12:29.250 --> 12:30.650
you're dating justin

12:30.660 --> 12:32.250
Wow.

12:32.260 --> 12:33.220
I don't know if it's
a wow thing,but--

12:33.230 --> 12:36.000
well,I-I-I didn't
see it coming.

12:36.720 --> 12:39.580
is that,uh,is that who's been calling

12:40.560 --> 12:42.670
Yeah,probably.

12:44.780 --> 12:46.990
So,um,you're in new
york,what,to just see friends

12:47.000 --> 12:49.600
Am I just the crash pad

12:52.160 --> 12:54.730
Actually,I me to see you.

12:59.290 --> 13:01.110
Is that okay to say

13:01.240 --> 13:03.000
Is it,uh,is it okay to say

13:03.010 --> 13:07.240
I mean,is it okay that
I'm here to see you

13:07.960 --> 13:10.140
Yeah,of course it is.

13:10.710 --> 13:12.020
Great.

13:20.130 --> 13:23.230
Hey,rebecca,it's me again.

13:23.500 --> 13:26.450
I would love to hear from
you and know that you're okay.

13:26.460 --> 13:29.830
So,um,call me when you get the chance.

13:30.550 --> 13:32.360
I love you.

13:36.350 --> 13:39.510
Justin,did you guys have a fight

13:40.220 --> 13:42.740
No,no.Um,look,that's

13:42.750 --> 13:44.220
I'm not here to judge you.

13:44.230 --> 13:45.660
I'm just trying to get
to the bottom of this.

13:45.670 --> 13:48.510
Holly,I told you,I don't
know why she split,all right

13:48.810 --> 13:51.490
Rebecca mentioned a girl named chelsea.

13:51.500 --> 13:53.730
God.Chelsea is my
sponsee,and it's over now.

13:53.740 --> 13:54.700
It's got nothing to do withhiS.

13:54.710 --> 13:56.160
- Then what does
- I don't know!

13:56.170 --> 13:57.600
Justin,you're her boyfriend.

13:57.610 --> 13:58.780
She hasn't called you

13:58.790 --> 14:00.180
Well,she's not calling you.

14:00.190 --> 14:01.580
I mean,how-- how's
your relationship

14:01.590 --> 14:04.120
- Good,actually.
- Oh,it isOh,that's great.

14:04.140 --> 14:06.210
How's work

14:06.630 --> 14:08.320
- What does that mean
- Nothing.

14:08.330 --> 14:11.320
Justin,you're not telling me the truth.

14:11.330 --> 14:12.410
You're calling me a liar now

14:12.420 --> 14:15.320
Yeah,because I know that
you're hiding something.

14:15.330 --> 14:16.800
That might work with
other people,but I--

14:16.810 --> 14:18.420
wait,is that why you
came here,to blame me

14:18.430 --> 14:20.600
Because I am not the cause
of rebecca's problems,okay

14:20.610 --> 14:22.310
And I certainly did not drive her away!

14:22.320 --> 14:24.380
- I hope not.
- You know,I'm sick of putting up with your crap.

14:24.390 --> 14:27.420
Justin,you know,I don't really
care what you think about me.

14:27.430 --> 14:29.620
This is about rebecca.

14:29.630 --> 14:32.970
So why don't you call me
if you feel like helping

14:40.930 --> 14:44.160
S time you thoughtrebecca
was william's kid

14:44.170 --> 14:45.890
It all added up to that.

14:45.900 --> 14:50.560
And this woman holly-- you didn't
find out about her until after he died

14:50.570 --> 14:52.880
No,I knew something,not everything.

14:52.890 --> 14:54.060
But you didn't say anything

14:54.070 --> 14:55.010
I did once.

14:55.020 --> 14:57.820
He td me all about it,prised to end it.

14:58.940 --> 15:00.780
- I thought i was gullible.
- Yeah.

15:01.150 --> 15:03.490
And you never knew
anything about my mother

15:03.500 --> 15:05.350
No,nothing.

15:07.630 --> 15:10.310
So how many were there
I mean,were there others

15:11.090 --> 15:12.740
I don't know.

15:12.750 --> 15:14.210
Maybe.I don't--I
don't know.

15:14.220 --> 15:16.430
Yeah.You don't know much,do you

15:21.150 --> 15:22.450
You know t onehing
I've been hanging on to

15:22.460 --> 15:27.340
is this stupid hope that
whatever my mother did,

15:27.350 --> 15:30.340
maybe it was worth it,he was worth it.

15:30.670 --> 15:33.190
God.He sounds like a real rk.

15:33.460 --> 15:34.460
Maybe that's not the right word.

15:34.470 --> 15:37.140
Maybe pig is better.

15:37.480 --> 15:39.170
Ryan...

15:39.210 --> 15:43.400
there's nothing you can call him that
I haven't already called him myself.

15:43.410 --> 15:48.160
But he was not all bad,I swear to you.

15:49.720 --> 15:50.850
Oh,it's a lot to process.

15:50.860 --> 15:52.190
It's just gonna take time.

15:52.200 --> 15:54.540
All of my children reacted
exactly the same way.

15:54.550 --> 15:56.880
- They got through it.
- I'm not one of your children.

15:56.890 --> 15:57.810
No,I know,I know.

15:57.820 --> 15:59.560
I don't need a mother.I
already have one.

15:59.570 --> 16:01.790
And just because
she's dead,doesn't--

16:01.800 --> 16:03.590
I know that,ry--
I didn't mean--

16:03.600 --> 16:05.350
this has all been very informative,

16:05.360 --> 16:06.910
and I really appreciate
you coming up here,

16:06.920 --> 16:10.520
but I have a final
tomorrow,so I'm gonna go study.

16:10.530 --> 16:12.590
Uh,okay

16:17.410 --> 16:18.740
This one's great.

16:18.750 --> 16:20.150
What freeway is this

16:20.160 --> 16:22.430
Well,we call it a highway here.

16:23.070 --> 16:24.620
It's actually the 95 south.

16:24.630 --> 16:26.280
I took that about 400 A.M.

16:26.290 --> 16:29.160
Uh,what were you doing
under a highway at 400 A.M.

16:29.170 --> 16:31.140
Well,I,actually,I was
coming back from a party.

16:31.150 --> 16:35.310
- Oh,god.
- Yeah,it's,uh,this is the photograph that got me into the show.

16:35.320 --> 16:38.100
Somebody from diaBeacon
saw it and,you know,

16:38.110 --> 16:40.110
it just generated a little bit of buzz.

16:40.120 --> 16:41.570
Oh,you've got buzz.

16:41.580 --> 16:43.670
Yeah,a tempered buzz.

16:44.450 --> 16:45.560
what about you

16:45.570 --> 16:47.220
How are you doing

16:47.230 --> 16:51.000
Oh,you know,actu-- I
guess I should answer.

16:51.010 --> 16:53.560
Oh,you know what I'm
gonna go put these away.

16:53.580 --> 16:55.000
Okay.

16:59.520 --> 17:01.380
- hey.
- Where the hell are you

17:01.390 --> 17:02.510
I'm visiting some friends.

17:02.520 --> 17:03.930
- How are you doing
- Um,I don't know.

17:03.940 --> 17:05.040
My--my girlfriend
disappears

17:05.050 --> 17:07.920
to go visit a so-called friend
and won't return my calls.

17:07.930 --> 17:09.950
How do you think I'm doing,rebecca

17:09.960 --> 17:11.030
Li,where are you

17:11.040 --> 17:12.390
I'm fine.You can stop worrying.

17:12.400 --> 17:14.510
Okay,good.Well,maybe you
canget that message to your mom

17:14.520 --> 17:16.089
so she doesn't pay me
any more nasty visits.

17:16.099 --> 17:17.150
Wait,you talked to my mom

17:17.160 --> 17:18.319
No.Actually,we didn't talk.

17:18.329 --> 17:20.440
She just accused,as if this
whole thing is my fault.

17:20.450 --> 17:21.470
Okay.But you didn't tell her anything,

17:21.480 --> 17:22.920
right,about what I told you about tommy

17:22.930 --> 17:25.119
What,about you hacking into
his computer withoutwi knong

17:25.130 --> 17:26.500
No,I left that part out,rebecca.

17:26.510 --> 17:27.540
You know what I can't do this right now.

17:27.550 --> 17:29.480
I'm sorry.I'll talk to you later.

17:32.650 --> 17:34.620
everything okay

17:34.630 --> 17:38.740
Yeah,no,I mean,no one died,so...

17:39.430 --> 17:41.290
that's good.

17:43.390 --> 17:45.290
You know what I'm--I'm gonna
change this picture out.

17:45.300 --> 17:46.680
Okay.

17:59.540 --> 18:01.510
hey,tommy,have you heard from rebecca

18:01.520 --> 18:02.940
Uh,no,I got a call in to her.

18:02.950 --> 18:05.710
We're supposed to go over this
trade show brochure this morning.

18:05.720 --> 18:08.460
So she didn't say anything
to you about going out of town

18:08.470 --> 18:09.980
No,uh...

18:10.260 --> 18:11.570
- did she
- I don't know.

18:11.580 --> 18:14.650
I got this mysterious
text message from her

18:14.660 --> 18:18.300
saying she was out of town for
a few days,staying with a friend.

18:18.310 --> 18:20.020
I'm sure she's okay.

18:20.300 --> 18:21.940
Well,I don't know what to think.

18:21.950 --> 18:24.330
This is what she would always
do when she was younger.

18:24.340 --> 18:26.200
She would drop off the face of the earth

18:26.210 --> 18:29.810
whenever we had a fight or whenever
she and a boyfriend broke up.

18:29.820 --> 18:30.960
She's not a kid anymore.

18:30.970 --> 18:33.360
I'm sure there's some explanation.

18:34.600 --> 18:36.010
I hope so.

18:36.020 --> 18:37.640
Let me check her calendar.

18:37.650 --> 18:39.730
There might be something there.

19:09.330 --> 19:11.200
the republican party has lost its way...

19:11.210 --> 19:13.710
- oh,robert,all I meant is it needs to be inclusive.
- It's not my party.Are you kidding me

19:13.720 --> 19:16.250
And--and by the way,I'm not the
only one to have pointed that out.

19:16.260 --> 19:18.480
Look.My husband doesn't
need an aphrodisiac.

19:18.490 --> 19:19.920
He does just fine with women on his own.

19:19.930 --> 19:21.830
Of all the things
that you could've said!

19:21.840 --> 19:22.640
Do you know what that projects

19:22.650 --> 19:23.590
Oh,is that what you're worut abo

19:23.600 --> 19:24.740
You're worried about
what we're projecting

19:24.750 --> 19:26.440
One of the reasons I
lost the nomination was

19:26.450 --> 19:29.080
because of rumors that I kicked
my first wife to the curb.

19:29.090 --> 19:31.340
I mean,is it that hard for you to try to

19:31.350 --> 19:33.580
present this marriage
as even remotely stable

19:33.590 --> 19:35.240
Yes.

19:35.250 --> 19:37.880
Yes,robert,it is that hard.

19:37.890 --> 19:40.970
You decided to run for governor
without even discussing it with me.

19:40.980 --> 19:41.840
You didn't want to discuss it.

19:41.850 --> 19:43.120
I told you about it,and you went to bed.

19:43.130 --> 19:45.560
Oh,please,robert,you had already
made up your mind,and you know it.

19:45.570 --> 19:47.460
So--so what is
this This is payback

19:47.470 --> 19:48.700
- Oh,god. You know what You always do that.
- You don't get your way,

19:48.710 --> 19:51.810
- so you air our dirty laundry to a journalist
- You know,you always try to take the moral high ground.

19:51.820 --> 19:53.460
You're the one who said
that the most important

19:53.470 --> 19:57.190
things in a marriage are
honesty and honesty,so be honest.

19:57.200 --> 19:58.230
you're tryg to sabotage this.

19:58.240 --> 20:00.350
Is that truly what you're worried about

20:00.360 --> 20:01.820
You're worried about your candidacy

20:01.840 --> 20:04.760
What about-- what
about what I said

20:04.770 --> 20:08.960
What about how I feel about our marriage

20:08.750 --> 20:10.660
You knew what you were getting into when you married me.

20:10.660 --> 20:13.830
Okay,just because I happened to know that you were ambitious 

20:13.830 --> 20:17.060
doesn't mean that you're absolved from considering my point of view.

20:17.060 --> 20:18.490
I consider your point of view.

20:18.490 --> 20:19.750
I-I just don't always agree with it.

20:19.750 --> 20:23.190
Right.Because you don't even know what it is.

20:23.190 --> 20:25.300
My god,robert,just for-- for one second,

20:25.300 --> 20:27.700
can't you just put yourself in my shoes 

20:27.700 --> 20:31.210
Then who would be in mine

20:39.550 --> 20:41.370
Thank you.

20:41.370 --> 20:42.540
I'm sorry.

20:42.540 --> 20:45.520
I guess I just felt like I really needed to get away from him.

20:45.520 --> 20:47.650
Yeah,I feel that way a lot,trust me.

20:47.650 --> 20:52.340
kevin,if you think that insulting robert is-- is gonna make me feel better,it...

20:52.340 --> 20:54.180
you're right.

20:54.180 --> 20:57.310
look,kit,the last thing I want to do is undermine your maiage.

20:57.310 --> 21:00.260
Oh,come on,kev,this is not your fault.

21:00.260 --> 21:03.000
I wish it were,because then I could just scream at you,and it would all be over,

21:03.000 --> 21:06.530
but unfortunately,the problems in my marriage have nothing to do with you.

21:06.530 --> 21:10.310
So this is more than just him running for governor

21:10.310 --> 21:12.980
Yeah,it's-- it's a lot of things.

21:12.980 --> 21:15.450
I mean,we're about to have a baby.

21:15.450 --> 21:19.220
You know,we should be coming together.

21:19.220 --> 21:22.410
We--we shou-- anyw,we're not.

21:22.410 --> 21:24.040
We're-- we're doing the opposite.

21:24.040 --> 21:27.120
Well,there's a lot of pressure on you guys right now.

21:28.350 --> 21:31.560
Do you know that he thinks I'm sabotaging him

21:31.560 --> 21:32.890
That's him being paranoid.

21:32.890 --> 21:37.150
I don't know.Maybe I did say some things in that interview that I...

21:37.150 --> 21:39.610
probably shouldn't have said,but...

21:39.610 --> 21:42.790
you know,it's not like I did it on purpose,but...

21:42.790 --> 21:45.690
I don't know.I guess things have to come out somewhere,right?

21:45.690 --> 21:50.050
Right.So if you don't want him to run for governor,ask him to sit this one out.

21:50.050 --> 21:51.080
I can'T.

21:51.080 --> 21:52.980
Why not

21:52.980 --> 21:56.700
Because he'll say no.

22:01.380 --> 22:03.270
Well,I hope it beats takeout.

22:03.270 --> 22:04.590
Yeah,by far.

22:04.590 --> 22:06.190
I didn't mean for you to go to all this trouble.

22:06.190 --> 22:08.210
No,no,are you kidding me. I mean,it's the least i could do.

22:08.210 --> 22:09.260
You're putting me up.

22:09.260 --> 22:13.420
So are you ever gonna tell me what exactly prompted this trip

22:13.420 --> 22:15.290
I told you.I wanted to visit.

22:15.290 --> 22:16.870
So you just woke up yesterday in L.A.

22:16.870 --> 22:20.590
And,I don't know,I guess you were looking at a couple days off and...

22:20.590 --> 22:27.310
(chuckles) you thought,I think it's time for me and my dad to start spending some time together,or what

22:27.310 --> 22:31.980
Well,obviously,I think about you,you know,having a relationship with you.

22:31.980 --> 22:33.880
I mean,no pressure.

22:33.880 --> 22:37.770
I guess I just-- I wanted to hang out with you like we did today.

22:39.210 --> 22:42.390
But you didn't start with an e-mail or a phone call.

22:42.390 --> 22:45.310
You just--you just hopped on a plane.

22:45.310 --> 22:49.120
I guess I should've called.

22:49.120 --> 22:54.330
I'm just wondering if there's something going on back home that has to do with you being here.

22:56.010 --> 22:58.310
I wanted to get to know my father.Isn't that enough?

22:58.310 --> 23:00.030
I don't know.

23:00.030 --> 23:01.640
You're not answering ur phone.

23:01.640 --> 23:03.950
Your mom doesn't know you're here.

23:03.950 --> 23:07.180
You know,it seems to me like you're bolting from someone.

23:07.180 --> 23:09.740
Everythi is fine at home.I'm not bolting.

23:09.740 --> 23:11.890
Well,you're talking to a professional here.

23:11.890 --> 23:15.170
You know,I know it when I see it.

23:15.960 --> 23:18.890
Why are you being like this

23:18.890 --> 23:22.020
Because I feel like you're playing games with me,and,um,

23:22.020 --> 23:26.410
I would really appreciate it if you would show me a little more respect than that.

23:26.410 --> 23:31.450
You know,I left L.A.For you so you could have your mom and the walkers.

23:31.450 --> 23:33.800
And,you know,you got what you wanted.

23:33.800 --> 23:39.000
But now,after all this time,you suddenly drop back into my life,wh,

23:39.000 --> 23:42.290
no pressure,just to hang out

23:42.290 --> 23:44.370
I didn't think it would be such a problem.

23:44.370 --> 23:46.810
I'm trying to figure you out,rebecca.

23:46.810 --> 23:48.520
I mean,what is it that you want from me

23:48.520 --> 23:50.180
Do you want me to be a dad

23:50.180 --> 23:51.600
Do you want me to be a friend

23:51.600 --> 23:54.630
-What is it that you want from me
-I don't know.

23:54.630 --> 23:57.120
Nothing.

23:57.120 --> 24:00.960
This was a mistake.I should never have come here.

24:01.700 --> 24:03.710
Rebecca.

24:03.710 --> 24:05.030
rebecca.

24:05.030 --> 24:09.090
My m was right.You only care about yourself.

24:11.830 --> 24:13.330
thanks for letting me just drop by.

24:13.330 --> 24:15.660
No problem.Come on in.

24:15.660 --> 24:17.190
I was surprised to get your phone call.

24:17.190 --> 24:18.080
Can I get you a drink

24:18.080 --> 24:19.070
No,I'm fine.

24:19.070 --> 24:21.120
I don't want to take up any more of your time.

24:21.120 --> 24:22.820
Oh,it's no--no problem.

24:22.820 --> 24:26.790
But I know that you have looked over contracts like this a hundred times.

24:26.790 --> 24:30.420
And I was hoping that maybe you could help explain something to me.

24:30.420 --> 24:32.640
All right,but tell me,what exactly would I be looking at

24:32.640 --> 24:35.440
Acquisition papers for a deal that's pending.

24:35.440 --> 24:41.130
Recently,we acquired additional orchards up at ojai,about 2,000 acres.

24:41.130 --> 24:43.790
Oh,that s-sounds like a smart move.

24:43.790 --> 24:45.320
I hope so.

24:45.320 --> 24:49.060
Okay,but now this is what concerns me.

24:49.060 --> 24:51.220
Let's see,where is it

24:51.220 --> 24:53.540
Where are you,exactly,with this deal

24:53.540 --> 24:57.380
Oh,it's with the lawyers,in the process of being finalized.

24:57.380 --> 25:03.970
So it says,notification of request for change shall be sent to omni,inc.

25:03.970 --> 25:06.350
But our deal is with crawford.

25:06.350 --> 25:08.860
So who's omni,inc.

25:08.860 --> 25:10.910
Um,is that their accounting firm or-- 

25:10.910 --> 25:15.110
well,off the top of my head,I would say that omni,inc.Is probably the D.B.A.For crawford.

25:15.110 --> 25:19.440
I mean,I can't picture anybody buying apricots from omni,inc.,So it's probably-- 

25:19.440 --> 25:21.960
yeah,okay,okay,but if that were the case...

25:21.960 --> 25:25.240
Wouldn't that be on the front of the contract

25:25.240 --> 25:32.810
Like ojai foods,which is the D.B.A of ojai industries,which is here,very clearly denoted.

25:32.810 --> 25:34.090
See

25:34.090 --> 25:36.580
Yeah,that's true.

25:39.260 --> 25:43.020
You know what I'm--I'm sorry that I am bothering you.

25:43.020 --> 25:45.000
I'm gonna take this to the legal department.

25:45.000 --> 25:45.860
They can look it over in the morning.

25:45.860 --> 25:47.880
No,no,h-holly,it's fine.No,come on.

25:47.880 --> 25:53.110
Let me-- let me try and figure this o.I kn I can do it.

25:53.590 --> 25:54.970
Okay.

25:54.970 --> 25:56.580
Let's se.

25:56.580 --> 25:58.360
omni,omni...

25:58.360 --> 26:01.090
ah,here it is.

26:01.090 --> 26:03.810
It's just a holding company for crawford.

26:03.810 --> 26:06.350
Your business is totally with crawford.

26:06.350 --> 26:09.460
I've seen many contracts just like this.

26:09.460 --> 26:13.210
So as far as you're concerned,they're just corporate entity that you're doing business with.

26:13.210 --> 26:15.280
-Just with crawford.
-Exactly.

26:15.280 --> 26:19.230
This looks fine to me.Just fine.

26:19.230 --> 26:20.880
Thank you.

26:20.880 --> 26:23.340
-Thank you.
Sure,sure,pleasure.

26:23.340 --> 26:25.540
-may I ask you something before you go?
-Yeah,sure.

26:25.540 --> 26:30.420
An acquisition this size,and loans are very hard to get...

26:30.420 --> 26:31.910
that's a good question.

26:31.910 --> 26:36.610
We paid with shares-- tommy's and mine.

26:36.610 --> 26:38.320
I see.

26:38.320 --> 26:40.110
Thanks.

26:48.800 --> 26:52.500
saul,what I'm asleep.

26:53.440 --> 26:55.410
Ryan.

26:59.410 --> 27:01.430
Ryan.

27:01.430 --> 27:03.690
I'm sorry.I-I didn't know where else to go.

27:03.690 --> 27:06.360
No,I-I'm glad you came.

27:06.360 --> 27:08.370
I just--I just can't keep doing this,you know

27:08.370 --> 27:11.090
-I'm--I'm trying to hold it all together and--and-- 
-it's okay,ryan.

27:11.090 --> 27:12.540
-It's okay.
-No,it's not.

27:12.540 --> 27:15.330
It's not okay.

27:15.330 --> 27:17.330
Nothing is the way I thought it was.

27:17.330 --> 27:19.740
She was my mom.

27:19.740 --> 27:22.180
We were really close.

27:22.180 --> 27:24.240
But now I feel like I-I didn't even know her.

27:24.240 --> 27:25.640
She couldn't tell you this.

27:25.640 --> 27:26.870
She wanted to protect you.

27:26.870 --> 27:28.020
How do you know what she wanted

27:28.020 --> 27:30.110
Because that's what wanted,too.

27:30.110 --> 27:31.010
Really

27:31.010 --> 27:33.620
Did you have an affair

27:33.620 --> 27:35.450
No.

27:35.450 --> 27:37.960
No.

27:37.960 --> 27:41.090
But william and I were married for a very long time,

27:41.090 --> 27:46.760
and even after he told me the affair was over,there were times wn I knew something wasn't right,

27:46.760 --> 27:48.790
and I just looked the other way.

27:48.790 --> 27:53.200
I-I didn't want my life to change or to lose the things that mattered to me,

27:53.200 --> 27:59.180
so every time I got close to suspecting something,I just--

27:59.180 --> 28:01.110
I just looked the other way.

28:01.110 --> 28:05.230
I...I wanted to protect my family.

28:05.230 --> 28:10.560
It sounds to me like you just wanted to protect yourself.

28:10.560 --> 28:14.280
God.This was such a mistake.

28:15.220 --> 28:19.170
Ryan,this is not just william's mess.

28:19.170 --> 28:22.900
I was there the whole time 

28:22.900 --> 28:25.670
in some ways,I helped make it.

28:25.670 --> 28:31.550
So I'm partly responsible for what you're going through right now.

28:33.570 --> 28:36.170
And I'm so sorry.

28:47.790 --> 28:49.370
Can I talk to you a sec

28:49.370 --> 28:51.250
Yeah.What's up

28:54.530 --> 28:56.300
I'm not gonna kill it.

28:56.300 --> 28:57.610
You're not

28:57.610 --> 28:58.790
I think it's a good piece for her.

28:58.790 --> 29:03.420
I think she deserves it,and I think we can deal with whatever fallout might come from it.

29:03.420 --> 29:05.410
And I think if what she said could damage your campaign,

29:05.410 --> 29:07.480
I would talk to her and do something about it,

29:07.480 --> 29:11.260
but this is about you and kitty.

29:11.260 --> 29:15.350
If you want to kill the story,you're gonna have to do it yourself.

29:15.350 --> 29:17.930
Okay.

29:20.540 --> 29:22.830
Okay.

29:43.590 --> 29:46.110
you forgot your scarf.

29:47.060 --> 29:48.060
I'm a big girl.

29:48.060 --> 29:49.510
You didn't have to come find me.

29:49.510 --> 29:52.310
I could have let myself in.

29:52.310 --> 29:56.170
Okay,so maybe the scarf was just a big ruse.

29:56.170 --> 29:58.980
And I wanted to tell you that I was out of line back there.

29:58.980 --> 30:00.960
Oh,don't worry about it.

30:00.960 --> 30:03.850
I don't know why I expected anything more from you.

30:05.920 --> 30:07.370
But,you know,I shouldn't single you out.

30:07.370 --> 30:09.800
You think I'd be used to people not being there for me-- you know,

30:09.800 --> 30:13.890
you,justin,every other man I've ever been involved with.

30:13.890 --> 30:17.770
I just keep making the same mistakes over and over again.

30:17.770 --> 30:21.180
And I was the original offender.

30:21.180 --> 30:22.410
Why?No,you weren'T.

30:22.410 --> 30:24.170
You didn't even know you had a daughter.

30:24.170 --> 30:26.860
I've known for almost a year now.

30:26.860 --> 30:28.590
I asked you to leave.We agreed.

30:28.590 --> 30:31.330
I know,and I shouldn't have agreed.

30:31.330 --> 30:33.090
But I mean,come on.Let's be honest.

30:33.090 --> 30:36.390
You gave me an out,and I took it.

30:36.390 --> 30:38.120
I let you go.

30:38.120 --> 30:43.300
You know,I-I don't think it's fair for me to expect you tonight to just sit down over dinner 

30:43.300 --> 30:45.290
and--and share your problems with me.

30:45.290 --> 30:49.680
I-I-I haven't earned that yet.

30:49.680 --> 30:52.790
And I'm sorry.

30:55.540 --> 30:59.510
Well,since you are here,can I tell you about this crazy theory 

30:59.510 --> 31:03.340
I have about tommy walker trying to drive my mom out of the business

31:03.340 --> 31:06.020
I'm all ears.

31:11.660 --> 31:12.970
What's--what's going on

31:12.970 --> 31:14.360
What's so urgent

31:14.360 --> 31:15.860
Well,holly was just at my house.

31:15.860 --> 31:19.140
She was asking me questions about a contract with crawford orchards.

31:19.140 --> 31:20.800
-What?
-I told you it was a bad deal,tommy,

31:20.800 --> 31:22.950
-but you just went ahead and-- 
-no,enough with the I told you so.

31:22.950 --> 31:24.340
What exactly did she ask you

31:24.340 --> 31:26.130
She wanted to know about omni.

31:26.130 --> 31:27.150
So is that what you did,tommy

31:27.150 --> 31:29.230
You bought crawford with this holding company

31:29.230 --> 31:31.520
What did you tell her

31:31.520 --> 31:32.730
I downplayed it.

31:32.730 --> 31:35.180
I told her that crawford and omni were basically the same thing.

31:35.180 --> 31:36.930
And shwas satisfied with that

31:36.930 --> 31:38.210
-Oh,yes.
-Okay,good.

31:38.210 --> 31:40.290
Well,then there's--there's-- there's nothing to worry about.

31:40.290 --> 31:42.970
The,uh,the al's almost done.

31:42.970 --> 31:44.160
Tell me something,tommy.

31:44.160 --> 31:46.550
Where did you get the money to buy this land

31:46.550 --> 31:48.120
Because if you did something illegal-- 

31:48.120 --> 31:50.140
dad had to borrow from the pension plan.

31:50.140 --> 31:51.660
Sometimes you have to bend the rules.

31:51.660 --> 31:53.440
No,you don'T.You don't,tommy.

31:53.440 --> 31:56.250
Ojai belongso us.It is our family'S.

31:56.250 --> 31:57.340
Dad didn't leave it to holly.

31:57.340 --> 31:59.550
I'm just taking back what's rightfully ours.

31:59.550 --> 32:00.340
We blew it.

32:00.340 --> 32:03.210
Do you understand that I blew it.

32:03.210 --> 32:05.800
The only reason ojai foods is around today is because of holly.

32:05.800 --> 32:07.060
E got us out of a bind.

32:07.060 --> 32:08.650
It doesn't make it her company.

32:08.650 --> 32:10.710
Oh,yes,it does,tommy.Yes,it does.

32:10.710 --> 32:12.560
That was the deal.

32:12.560 --> 32:14.410
Uncle saul,I appreciate your advice.

32:14.410 --> 32:16.870
I'm thankful that you covered for me.

32:16.870 --> 32:20.030
But it is too late.

32:20.290 --> 32:22.720
The deal's done.

32:31.190 --> 32:33.500
Morning.

32:34.580 --> 32:37.630
I'm sorry.

32:37.630 --> 32:40.630
I'm sorry that I didn't confide in you.

32:40.630 --> 32:44.980
I think I was telling myself that I was waiting until the campaign was a certainty.

32:44.980 --> 32:48.920
But I think the truth of it is,I...

32:49.480 --> 32:51.990
Was scared you'd say no.

32:51.990 --> 32:55.380
Because what you say means more to me than anybody.

32:55.380 --> 32:58.530
Well,it doesn't always seem like that.

32:58.530 --> 33:02.810
Look,if I have to choose between you and being the governor...

33:02.810 --> 33:06.850
I'm choosing you.

33:10.510 --> 33:15.450
Robert,I-I-I know that this is your moment.

33:15.450 --> 33:18.280
And I want you to seize it.

33:18.280 --> 33:20.290
But I have to be able to speak my mind.

33:20.290 --> 33:22.970
I-I have to be able to write a book without worrying about 

33:22.970 --> 33:26.670
how it's going to affect what you'rtrying to accomplish.

33:26.670 --> 33:29.910
It just--it just-- it has to be...

33:29.910 --> 33:32.350
-okay 
-it is okay.

33:32.350 --> 33:33.980
It's more than okay.

33:33.980 --> 33:36.460
And this campaign doesn't have to be like the last one.

33:36.460 --> 33:38.560
You can do as much or as little as you want.

33:38.560 --> 33:41.660
We will work around you.

33:42.700 --> 33:46.440
And I don't want to make it harder for you.

33:46.440 --> 33:51.470
And I really am sorry about the article.

33:51.960 --> 33:54.820
I want this to work.

33:54.820 --> 33:58.550
I am gonna do whatever I have to do.

34:05.440 --> 34:08.080
ryan

34:10.850 --> 34:13.000
I was thinking about what you said last night.

34:13.000 --> 34:14.670
Can you not worry about last night,please

34:14.670 --> 34:18.080
I was just having a really bad night,and it's not a big deal.

34:18.080 --> 34:19.760
I want to help you.

34:19.760 --> 34:21.530
I know you don't think I can,and maybe I can't--

34:21.530 --> 34:25.370
I really can't talk about this right now,okay

34:29.179 --> 34:35.860
Ryan,you have five brothers and sisters who all went through their own version of what you're going through right now.

34:35.860 --> 34:38.090
So...

34:38.090 --> 34:40.500
here.

34:40.900 --> 34:44.570
-What's this?
-It's a plane ticket,an--an--an e-ticket.

34:44.570 --> 34:46.120
I want you to come and meet them.

34:46.120 --> 34:48.400
Come for a day or a weekend,whatever you want.

34:48.400 --> 34:50.440
I think you'd like them.

34:50.440 --> 34:51.610
You think they'd like me

34:51.610 --> 34:52.820
Well,I don't know.

34:52.820 --> 34:54.790
Why don't you give it a try

34:54.790 --> 34:57.820
I can't believe you bought me a plane ticket.

34:57.820 --> 35:00.250
You know,you're kind of a spontaneous person.

35:00.250 --> 35:02.750
I didn't use to be.

35:02.750 --> 35:05.560
Will you think about it

35:05.880 --> 35:07.850
I don't know what to say.

35:07.850 --> 35:09.160
Well,say you'll come.

35:09.160 --> 35:11.470
Me this weekend.

35:13.070 --> 35:18.300
well--well,I don't have to--to work tomorrow,and all my finals are do,except for one.

35:18.300 --> 35:20.500
But that's not until next week.

35:20.500 --> 35:21.940
Well,then come today.

35:21.940 --> 35:24.550
Come today,ryan.come on.

35:24.550 --> 35:27.990
My house is empty.It would be like having a library all to yourself.

35:27.990 --> 35:30.100
All right.Okay.All right.All right.

35:30.100 --> 35:32.420
Look,you know where I'm staying.

35:32.420 --> 35:33.750
The cab is picking me up at 2:00.

35:33.750 --> 35:37.100
All you have to do is come by and hop in.

35:39.530 --> 35:41.260
are you sure this is a good idea

35:41.260 --> 35:44.130
Yes.Yes.

35:47.130 --> 35:50.920
okay,but I-I have to finish up around here first.

35:50.920 --> 35:53.050
All right,you do that.

35:53.050 --> 35:54.880
Ryan,y-you're not all alone in this.

35:54.880 --> 35:56.890
You'll see.

35:56.890 --> 35:59.020
Great.

36:08.600 --> 36:11.350
I moved up my flight.

36:14.110 --> 36:15.600
I figured I'd go deal.

36:15.600 --> 36:17.210
That's probably a good idea.

36:17.210 --> 36:18.680
Yeah.

36:18.680 --> 36:20.640
Thank you for listening last night.

36:20.640 --> 36:23.010
It's my pleasure.

36:23.240 --> 36:24.800
You know,I have a friend with a car.

36:24.800 --> 36:26.060
I could probably drive you.

36:26.060 --> 36:27.310
Oh,that's all right.The roads are bad.

36:27.310 --> 36:30.730
I already asked howard to get me a cab downstairs.

36:32.030 --> 36:33.530
Here.

36:34.270 --> 36:36.150
oh,thank you.

36:36.810 --> 36:38.700
If you need to talk,you'll call,right

36:38.700 --> 36:39.580
Yeah,yeah,for sure.

36:39.580 --> 36:40.510
But don't worry about it.

36:40.510 --> 36:42.560
I'll figure it out and...

36:42.560 --> 36:44.990
and you are so busy out here.

36:44.990 --> 36:47.230
I'm sure the show's gonna be a huge hit.

36:47.230 --> 36:49.190
From your lips.

36:49.190 --> 36:50.420
I'll see you soon.

36:50.420 --> 36:52.600
I hope so.

36:52.600 --> 36:55.490
Oh,I almost forgot.

36:59.250 --> 37:00.270
bye.

37:00.270 --> 37:02.030
Bye.

37:09.230 --> 37:11.520
-Mrs.Harper-- 
-holly.

37:11.520 --> 37:16.540
I'm glad you've comto us now,and we would certainly be interested in helping you from here on out.

37:16.540 --> 37:18.630
From here on out?

37:18.630 --> 37:21.500
You were right to wonder about this omni corporation.

37:21.500 --> 37:24.710
Um,while it is a legitimate holding company for crawford orchards,

37:24.710 --> 37:29.450
and while the deal technically is sound,omni was formed just weeks ago.

37:29.450 --> 37:31.310
Weeks ago?

37:31.310 --> 37:34.180
By your partner,omas walker.

37:34.180 --> 37:36.330
Tommy?

37:36.330 --> 37:40.950
Now these are the articles of incorporation filed five weeks ago.

37:41.950 --> 37:46.950
Holly,this deal between ojai foods and crawford orchards involves a transfer of shares.

37:46.950 --> 37:47.880
Oh,my god.

37:47.880 --> 37:49.260
When this transfer goes through...

37:49.260 --> 37:54.090
the shares will go directly to tommy.

37:54.280 --> 37:57.370
And he'll have majority ownership of ojai foods.

37:57.370 --> 38:00.020
Yes.

38:00.470 --> 38:03.360
He's gonna push me out.

38:03.360 --> 38:05.680
We would like to get into this...

38:05.680 --> 38:08.040
with your permission.

38:12.440 --> 38:13.870
Judy,can I call you back

38:13.870 --> 38:15.960
-Okay,thanks.Bye.
-No,no,no.Sorry.No,no,no,no.

38:15.960 --> 38:17.700
Come on,I-I didn't want to interrupt.

38:17.700 --> 38:19.040
Oh,not at all.

38:19.040 --> 38:21.750
Um,how are you?Robert said you talked.

38:21.750 --> 38:23.220
We did.

38:23.220 --> 38:26.340
-And?
-And he listened.

38:26.340 --> 38:27.410
U okay?

38:27.410 --> 38:30.540
I mean,you know,it's--it's a start.

38:30.540 --> 38:34.440
Look,the reason that I'm here is,I want to call barbara whitakerat the times,and I-I just want to-- I-I don't know.

38:34.440 --> 38:41.280
I just want to try and take the sting out of some of my quotes or maybe sort of,

38:41.280 --> 38:44.870
I don't know,beef up the context a little bit or...

38:44.870 --> 38:47.190
wh-wh-what wrong

38:47.190 --> 38:49.300
He didn't tell you,did he?

38:49.300 --> 38:50.550
Tell me what?

38:50.550 --> 38:52.750
There is no story.

38:52.750 --> 38:56.560
He called ed timberman at the times.

38:56.560 --> 38:58.190
Oh,my god.

38:58.190 --> 39:00.940
Kit,I...

39:00.940 --> 39:02.390
I don't know what to say.

39:02.390 --> 39:03.650
He killed the story.

39:03.650 --> 39:06.010
He said you'd come to some understanding,that,you know,

39:06.010 --> 39:10.520
he should have talked to you more,but you were fine with him running.

39:10.520 --> 39:12.810
-Kit-- 
-no,it's okay.

39:12.810 --> 39:14.870
It's okay.It'S...

39:14.870 --> 39:15.740
look,don't--don't go.

39:15.740 --> 39:17.520
-Just stay and talk.
-No,he kev.Come on.

39:17.520 --> 39:18.600
It's just a story,right

39:18.600 --> 39:21.360
It's--it's no big deal.

39:24.490 --> 39:25.650
mrs.Walker

39:25.650 --> 39:28.470
There's a phone call for you.

39:29.580 --> 39:31.430
Hello

39:31.430 --> 39:33.040
Ryan,where are you?Are you close£¿

39:33.040 --> 39:35.940
We really have to go.

39:37.460 --> 39:39.640
You're not£¿

39:40.810 --> 39:43.610
are you all right£¿

39:44.370 --> 39:46.680
yeah,I hope so.

39:46.680 --> 39:48.010
Okay.

39:48.010 --> 39:49.770
Bye.

39:54.300 --> 39:59.740
okay,so who's divorcing and who's hooking up this week

39:59.990 --> 40:04.830
I--something about airports,you know,it makes me want to read trashy magazines,too.

40:04.830 --> 40:06.450
What are you doing here

40:06.450 --> 40:07.440
You didn't need to see me off.

40:07.440 --> 40:09.970
Yeah,well,I didn't say what I wanted to say to you,

40:09.970 --> 40:13.270
and I-I-I didn't realize it until after your cab left.

40:13.270 --> 40:14.710
So you came here.

40:14.710 --> 40:16.690
You didn't want to try calling my cell

40:16.690 --> 40:19.150
I don't know.You don't-- you don't seem to answer it.

40:20.460 --> 40:25.040
Look,um,I know what we agreed on a year ago,but clearly,

40:25.040 --> 40:31.800
a lot of things have changed since then,and,uh,well,I know I have,so...

40:32.560 --> 40:35.960
I don't want to keep making the same mistakes.

40:35.960 --> 40:37.470
U're not.

40:37.470 --> 40:39.370
I'm so happy that I came.

40:39.370 --> 40:42.640
flight 2135 for los angeles is now boarding...

40:42.640 --> 40:44.820
that's me.

40:50.770 --> 40:51.640
All right.

40:51.640 --> 40:54.910
So,um,I'm in section D.

40:54.910 --> 40:57.780
So,uh,do you--do you want to tra

40:57.780 --> 40:59.410
What

40:59.410 --> 41:00.710
Are you kidding me

41:00.710 --> 41:02.750
You don't have to do this.

41:02.750 --> 41:05.890
I'm not looking for an out,rebecca,so 

41:06.130 --> 41:11.470
if,uh,it's okay with you,I'd--I'd like to get on that plane.

41:12.500 --> 41:14.470
Yeah,it's okay with me.

41:14.470 --> 41:15.800
Okay.

41:15.800 --> 41:18.240
let's go.
