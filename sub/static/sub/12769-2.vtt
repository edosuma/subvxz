BUT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT A BRAIN
THAT'S STILL DEVELOPING,

09:40.083 --> 09:42.041
NOT TO MENTION THE RISK OF
ADDICTION, INCREASED ANXIETY--

09:42.083 --> 09:44.834
MAYBE, BUT--
MAYBE? ARE YOU GONNA
CONDONE THIS? REALLY?

09:44.875 --> 09:46.875
I DON'T CONDONE ANYONE
MISUSING ANY PRESCRIPTION.

09:46.917 --> 09:49.041
AND GIVING IT TO HER KID?
OF COURSE NOT. I JUST--

09:49.083 --> 09:50.458
I UNDERSTAND HER DILEMMA.

09:50.500 --> 09:52.250
CONVENTIONAL TREATMENTS
HAVE FAILED,

09:52.291 --> 09:54.667
SO NOW SHE'S WILLING
TO TRY ANYTHING.

09:54.709 --> 09:56.667
I'VE SEEN THE LITERATURE,
PETE.

09:56.709 --> 09:59.458
I KNOW THAT THERE IS
A SMALL GROUP OF DOCTORS

09:59.500 --> 10:01.625
THAT SAY THAT IT WORKS
WITH AUTISTIC KIDS.

10:01.667 --> 10:03.250
OKAY. THEN MAYBE IT'S TIME

10:03.291 --> 10:05.875
FOR YOU TO CONSIDER
THE POSSIBILITY--
NO, WHAT I WAS GONNA SAY WAS,

10:05.917 --> 10:07.959
AND I HAVE TREATED KIDS
OLDER THAN ZACK,

10:08.000 --> 10:10.959
HEALTHY KIDS, THAT HAVE ENDED UP
WITH BEHAVIORAL PROBLEMS THAT--

10:11.000 --> 10:12.959
I MEAN, THERE ARE SO MANY
OTHER THERAPIES OUT THERE

10:13.000 --> 10:14.667
THAT ARE PROVEN TO WORK BETTER

10:14.709 --> 10:16.667
WITHOUT THE POSSIBLE
LONG-TERM SIDE EFFECTS.

10:16.709 --> 10:19.709
LOOK, I DON'T LIKE WHAT SYDNEY
DID ANY MORE THAN YOU DO,

10:19.750 --> 10:22.709
BUT MAYBE WE NEED TO KEEP
AN OPEN MIND HERE.

10:22.750 --> 10:24.709
IF MARIJUANA IS HELPING ZACK,

10:24.750 --> 10:28.375
WE OWE IT TO BOTH OF THEM
TO AT LEAST TALK ABOUT IT.

10:28.417 --> 10:31.542
OKAY, THE REASON WE DECIDED TO
KEEP OUR RELATIONSHIP A SECRET

10:31.583 --> 10:33.375
HAD NOTHING TO DO
WITH NAOMI.

10:33.417 --> 10:36.375
RIGHT? IT'S BECAUSE WE WANTED
TO GIVE OURSELVES A CHANCE TO--

10:36.417 --> 10:38.375
TO SEE WHAT THIS...
YOU KNOW, WHAT WE ARE.

10:38.417 --> 10:41.583
YEAH, BUT THE MERGER MEANS--
I KNOW. I KNOW
WHAT THE MERGER MEANS.

10:41.625 --> 10:43.583
I MEAN, GOD,
SHE'S NAOMI, SAM.

10:43.625 --> 10:45.291
SHE'S GONNA BE HERE ALL DAY.

10:45.333 --> 10:47.291
SHE'S GONNA FIGURE OUT
THAT WE'RE TOGETHER.

10:47.333 --> 10:49.959
WHICH IS WHY
WE NEED TO TELL HER.
(sighs)

10:50.000 --> 10:53.709
LOOK, WE KNOW WHAT WE ARE.
ALL RIGHT?

10:53.750 --> 10:55.083
WE WORK.

10:55.125 --> 10:58.083
AS A COUPLE, WE WORK.

10:58.125 --> 11:00.291
THERE'S NO REASON
TO HIDE THIS FROM HER.

11:00.333 --> 11:03.291
MAYBE WE WAIT
JUST A LITTLE WHILE, THOUGH.

11:03.333 --> 11:05.500
I MEAN, GIVE HER A CHANCE
TO GRIEVE WILLIAM.

11:05.542 --> 11:07.500
YOU KNOW, LET HER GET
HER FEET BACK UNDER HER?

11:07.542 --> 11:10.500
DO YOU WANT ME TO TELL HER?
IF YOU'RE AFRAID, THEN I CAN--

11:10.542 --> 11:14.041
NO, I'M NOT AFRAID.
I-I JUST--
WH--YOU JUST WHAT?

11:14.083 --> 11:16.709
FINE. I'LL...
I'LL TELL HER.

11:16.750 --> 11:19.041
I CAN TELL HER.
NO, I SHOULD.

11:19.083 --> 11:21.792
I'LL TELL HER ABOUT US.

11:23.792 --> 11:27.041
WHEN I WROTE YOU
THAT PRESCRIPTION,

11:27.083 --> 11:30.041
I ASSUMED YOU WOULD
USE IT RESPONSIBLY.
SINCE WHEN IS A MOTHER
HELPING HER CHILD IRRESPONSIBLE?

11:30.083 --> 11:32.041
WHEN IT INVOLVES GIVING HIM
A DRUG--ANY DRUG--

11:32.083 --> 11:34.041
NOT PRESCRIBED FOR HIM,

11:34.083 --> 11:36.041
BECAUSE ALONG WITH
BREAKING THE LAW,

11:36.083 --> 11:38.291
YOU VIOLATED MY TRUST.

11:40.083 --> 11:42.041
I KNEW
YOU WEREN'T GONNA LIKE IT.

11:42.083 --> 11:45.041
I JUST DIDN'T FEEL LIKE
I HAD A CHOICE.

11:45.083 --> 11:47.792
YOU HAVE OTHER OPTIONS,
ANTI-HYPERACTIVITY MEDS.

11:47.834 --> 11:49.458
WE TRIED THOSE.
BEHAVIORAL THERAPIES.

11:49.500 --> 11:52.333
WE GAVE UP ON THAT
TWO YEARS AGO. COME ON.

11:52.375 --> 11:54.333
DON'T YOU THINK
I'VE TRIED EVERYTHING,

11:54.375 --> 11:56.166
READ EVERY BOOK?

11:58.875 --> 12:01.250
I'M SORRY.
I'M JUST REALLY TIRED.

12:01.291 --> 12:02.875
I'M JUST TIRED.

12:02.917 --> 12:05.041
AND, UH...

12:05.083 --> 12:07.208
I DON'T KNOW
HOW TO DO THIS ANYMORE.

12:07.250 --> 12:09.250
I DON'T KNOW HOW TO
GET THROUGH THE DAY.

12:09.291 --> 12:11.208
OKAY.

12:11.250 --> 12:13.208
WE'LL COME UP WITH
ANOTHER PLAN TO HELP ZACK.

12:13.250 --> 12:14.667
WHEN?

12:14.709 --> 12:16.667
SOON. I KNOW HOW DIFFICULT
THIS IS FOR YOU.

12:16.709 --> 12:18.834
DON'T. DON'T SAY THAT.

12:18.875 --> 12:21.834
DO YOU HAVE
AN AUTISTIC CHILD?

12:21.875 --> 12:24.208
HAVE YOU EVER EVEN THOUGHT
WHAT THIS IS LIKE

12:24.250 --> 12:25.834
EVERY SINGLE DAY?

12:25.875 --> 12:28.041
YOU DON'T KNOW.
NOBODY KNOWS.

12:28.083 --> 12:29.917
I'M A SINGLE MOTHER!

12:29.959 --> 12:33.250
MY HUSBAND LEFT ME BECAUSE
HE COULDN'T HANDLE THIS.

12:33.291 --> 12:36.500
YOU HAVE NO IDEA! YOU HAVE
NO IDEA HOW DIFFICULT THIS IS!

12:36.542 --> 12:39.041
GET OUT!

12:39.083 --> 12:40.500
WHAT?

12:40.542 --> 12:43.667
I WON'T GIVE HIM YOUR POT,
SO YOU CAN GO!

12:43.709 --> 12:45.709
OKAY?!

12:48.000 --> 12:51.041
HOLá, CHICA.

12:51.083 --> 12:53.458
WHY AREN'T YOU IN SEATTLE?

12:53.500 --> 12:55.458
WELL, I GOT TO THE AIRPORT

12:55.500 --> 12:57.875
AND REMEMBERED
I'D ALREADY BEEN THERE.

12:57.917 --> 12:59.875
SO I WENT TO MEXICO INSTEAD.

12:59.917 --> 13:02.500
THE PLAN WAS TO SEE DEREK
IN SEATTLE.

13:02.542 --> 13:07.083
YEAH, WELL, PLANS CHANGE.
WHAT'D I MISS?

13:07.125 --> 13:10.959
WELL, NAOMI WANTS
TO MERGE THE PRACTICES.

13:11.000 --> 13:12.750
THAT'S COOL.

13:12.792 --> 13:16.041
THAT'S NOT COOL?

13:16.083 --> 13:18.291
(door closes)

13:18.333 --> 13:21.041
SAM AND I ARE A COUPLE.

13:21.083 --> 13:22.750
GO, ADDISON.

13:22.792 --> 13:25.125
I MEAN, IS HE AS GOOD IN BED
AS I THINK HE IS?

13:25.166 --> 13:26.750
BECAUSE HE HAS BIG HANDS.

13:26.792 --> 13:28.709
I MEAN, HE HAS BIG,
GIFTED HANDS.

13:28.750 --> 13:30.750
SHUT UP.

13:30.792 --> 13:32.750
NAOMI DOESN'T KNOW.
NO ONE KNOWS.

13:32.792 --> 13:35.500
AND I DON'T WANT TO TALK TO YOU
ABOUT SAM'S... HANDS.

13:35.542 --> 13:37.291
IF I HAD THAT MAN IN MY BED,

13:37.333 --> 13:39.291
I WOULD BE SHOUTING IT
FROM THE ROOFTOPS.

13:39.333 --> 13:42.000
I'D WRITE A SONG.
AMELIA, IT'S HARD.

13:42.041 --> 13:44.041
(laughs)
YEAH, IT'S HARD.

13:44.083 --> 13:48.208
AMELIA, I NEED YOU TO BE
A GROWN-UP HERE.

13:48.250 --> 13:50.166
(exhales)

13:50.208 --> 13:51.959
OKAY.

13:52.000 --> 13:53.959
YOU NEED TO TELL HER...

13:54.000 --> 13:55.792
BECAUSE SHE'S
YOUR BEST FRIEND,

13:55.834 --> 13:57.792
AND NOT TELLING HER...

13:57.834 --> 13:59.417
THAT'S UNDERESTIMATING
YOUR FRIENDSHIP.

13:59.458 --> 14:01.750
WHAT AM I GONNA SAY?

14:01.792 --> 14:04.333
HOW ABOUT...
"HERE'S THE DEAL, NAI.

14:04.375 --> 14:05.959
"I'M BANGING SAM.

14:06.000 --> 14:08.917
IF YOU PROMISE NOT TO BE MAD,
I'LL BUY YOU A GUCCI BAG"?

14:08.959 --> 14:11.583
WOULD--WOULD YOU EVER TRY
TO BRIBE DEREK?
IF I THOUGHT IT WOULD WORK,

14:11.625 --> 14:13.375
ABSOLUTELY.

14:13.417 --> 14:15.000
(exhales deeply)

14:15.041 --> 14:16.625
FINE.

14:16.667 --> 14:19.041
I'M GONNA TELL HER.

14:19.083 --> 14:23.000
I'LL JUST PUT IT OUT THERE,
AND... AND SEE WHAT HAPPENS.

14:25.667 --> 14:28.625
S-SO I WOKE UP IN A BED
FULL OF COOKIE CRUMBS, RIGHT?

14:28.667 --> 14:31.583
WITH MY COMPARATIVE LIT PROF
RIGHT--RIGHT NEXT TO ME.
(laughing)

14:31.625 --> 14:33.583
AND... (laughs)
THE WORST PART WAS,

14:33.625 --> 14:35.583
SHE STILL GAVE ME A "C"
IN THE COURSE.

14:35.625 --> 14:38.208
THAT'S NOTHING.
SOPHOMORE YEAR AT COLLEGE...

14:38.250 --> 14:39.333
YEAH?

14:39.375 --> 14:41.333
I WENT STRAIGHT FROM
AN ALL-NIGHT PARTY

14:41.375 --> 14:42.959
TO THE AIRPORT.

14:43.000 --> 14:45.000
I WAS SUPPOSED TO GO HOME
AND SEE MY FAMILY.

14:45.041 --> 14:47.166
I GOT ON THE WRONG PLANE.
I ENDED UP IN NORTH DAKOTA.

14:47.208 --> 14:49.834
WHAT, YOU FLEW THERE DIRECT?
I HAD TO CHANGE PLANES.
(laughs)

14:49.875 --> 14:51.041
(laughs)

14:51.083 --> 14:53.875
WHAT'S SO FUNNY?

14:53.917 --> 14:55.250
(laughs)
HE... (laughs)

14:55.291 --> 14:56.875
AH, NOTHING. NOTHING, MAN.
(laughs)

14:56.917 --> 14:58.625
(deep voice)
YOU HEARD THE MAN.

14:58.667 --> 15:01.041
OH, COOPER TOLD YOU.

15:01.083 --> 15:03.000
LOOK, WE ARE--
WE ARE NOT HERE TO JUDGE.

15:03.041 --> 15:05.000
(normal voice)
NO, BUT I MIGHT WANT TO MAKE

15:05.041 --> 15:07.000
AN APPOINTMENT WITH YOU
FOR A PRESCRIPTION.

15:07.041 --> 15:09.417
I HAVE THIS ACHE IN MY BACK.
(laughs)

15:09.458 --> 15:11.000
(laughs)

15:11.041 --> 15:13.000
HEY, I WAS JUST LOOKING
FOR YOU.

15:13.041 --> 15:16.000
WE HAVE A LITTLE PROBLEM.
IS THAT A POLITE WAY
OF YOU ASKING ME

15:16.041 --> 15:18.041
NOT TO SHAVE MY LEGS
WITH YOUR RAZOR?

15:18.083 --> 15:20.041
WELL, I DO WANT THAT.
(laughs)

15:20.083 --> 15:22.041
(chuckles)
BUT IT'S ABOUT COOPER.

15:22.083 --> 15:23.417
YOU WANT TO CHANGE COOPER?

15:23.458 --> 15:25.041
YOU AND COOPER, ACTUALLY.

15:25.083 --> 15:26.917
A LITTLE LESS YOU AND COOPER.

15:26.959 --> 15:28.291
N-NOW COME ON, VIOLET.

15:28.333 --> 15:30.291
HE CALLS EVERY MORNING.
HE CHECKS IN AFTER DINNER.

15:30.333 --> 15:33.542
SO WHAT?
IT'S ONLY PHONE CALLS.
AND TEXTS AND E-MAILS,

15:33.583 --> 15:36.291
AND HE'S ON OUR COUCH
THREE NIGHTS A WEEK WATCHING TV.

15:36.333 --> 15:38.291
DON'T HE AND CHARLOTTE
HAVE CABLE?
COOPER IS MY FRIEND.

15:38.333 --> 15:41.041
YEAH, WELL, THAT'S FINE.
OH, I'M SO GLAD
TO GET YOUR APPROVAL.

15:41.083 --> 15:43.625
I JUST WANT TO DRAW
SOME LINES, AND SO--

15:43.667 --> 15:46.834
NO, NO, YOU WANT TO HAVE
SOME CONTROL OF MY BEST FRIEND.

15:46.875 --> 15:48.208
A FRIEND I UNDERSTAND.

15:48.250 --> 15:50.208
BUT A GUY WHO CAN'T DECIDE
WHAT COLOR BOXERS TO WEAR

15:50.250 --> 15:52.041
WITHOUT CONSULTING YOU FIRST?

15:52.083 --> 15:54.041
THAT I'M HAVING
SOME TROUBLE WITH.

15:54.083 --> 15:55.500
YOU ARE SO WRONG.

15:55.542 --> 15:58.041
AND BESIDES,
COOPER WEARS BRIEFS.

15:58.083 --> 15:59.709
HEY, MR. PUSHER MAN.

15:59.750 --> 16:02.250
HEY, UH, WE'RE IN THE MIDDLE
OF A CONVERSATION HERE, COOPER.

16:02.291 --> 16:04.458
OH, YEAH? IS ABOUT, UH,
WHETHER TO PRESCRIBE POT TO

16:04.500 --> 16:07.667
AN AUTISTIC 12 YEAR OLD? 'CAUSE
I BET I KNOW WHAT YOU THINK.
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

16:07.709 --> 16:11.166
I SUGGESTED WE DISCUSS IT.
IT'S AN ADOLESCENT
WITH DEVELOPMENTAL ISSUES.

16:11.208 --> 16:13.083
THERE'S NO DISCUSSION.
NOTHING YOU'RE DOING
IS WORKING.

16:13.125 --> 16:15.709
YOU KNOW WHAT?
C-CAN WE TAKE THIS DOWN
A NOTCH?

16:15.750 --> 16:18.500
OKAY, WOULD YOU PRESCRIBE
MEDICAL MARIJUANA TO A PATIENT

16:18.542 --> 16:21.500
IF YOU KNEW IT WOULD TREAT
THEIR DESTRUCTIVE BEHAVIOR?
A 12-YEAR-OLD PATIENT,

16:21.542 --> 16:25.041
ALSO KNOWING THAT IT CAN
CAUSE LONG-TERM PROBLEMS.
I'M NOT GETTING
DRAGGED INTO THIS.

16:25.083 --> 16:26.959
UH-HUH.

16:27.000 --> 16:29.125
LET HIM GO.
IT'S HIS PROBLEM.

16:29.166 --> 16:30.750
UNTIL HE CALLS,

16:30.792 --> 16:33.792
AND I HAVE TO SPEND THE REST OF
THE NIGHT ON THE PHONE WITH HIM.

16:35.875 --> 16:37.208
HEY. THERE YOU ARE.

16:37.250 --> 16:38.542
HEY.

16:38.583 --> 16:41.750
UM, I, UH, I-I FOLLOWED UP
WITH PETE ABOUT THE MERGER.

16:41.792 --> 16:43.125
AND HE JUST KEEPS SAYING,

16:43.166 --> 16:45.125
YOU KNOW, "IT SOUNDS GOOD,
SOUNDS GOOD."

16:45.166 --> 16:47.333
SO I-I DON'T KNOW.
I GUESS THAT MEANS THAT IT--

16:47.375 --> 16:49.333
SOUNDS GOOD TO HIM?
YEAH.

16:49.375 --> 16:51.333
YOU KNOW, CHARLOTTE AND COOPER
DON'T SEEM TO CARE.

16:51.375 --> 16:53.333
AND--AND SHELDON'S MORE EXCITED
ABOUT THE FACT

16:53.375 --> 16:55.333
THAT THERE'S A COOKIE DRAWER
UP HERE

16:55.375 --> 16:58.166
THAN A POSSIBILITY
OF A 2-SHRINK PRACTICE.

16:58.208 --> 16:59.166
I...

16:59.208 --> 17:01.041
DID YOU EXPECT
MORE RESISTANCE?

17:01.083 --> 17:02.583
I DON'T--I DON'T KNOW.

17:02.625 --> 17:04.583
I-I GUESS I'VE BEEN
SO OVERWHELMED

17:04.625 --> 17:06.041
WITH EVERYTHING
THAT'S HAPPENED LATELY,

17:06.083 --> 17:07.583
I-I DON'T KNOW.

17:07.625 --> 17:09.583
I'M JUST--
I GUESS I'M JUST WAITING

17:09.625 --> 17:11.583
TO GET HIT
WITH SOMETHING ELSE.

17:11.625 --> 17:13.000
HUH.

17:13.041 --> 17:14.667
WHAT'S WRONG?
NOTHING.

17:14.709 --> 17:16.667
THAT'S NOT
A "NOTHING'S WRONG" FACE, ADDIE.

17:16.709 --> 17:18.166
WHAT'S WRONG?

17:18.208 --> 17:19.709
NO, I, UH...

17:22.375 --> 17:25.709
I-I JUST WANTED
TO TELL YOU THAT...

17:27.083 --> 17:28.834
I'M SORRY...

17:28.875 --> 17:30.208
ABOUT WILLIAM.

17:30.250 --> 17:32.250
HE WAS AN AMAZING GUY.

17:32.291 --> 17:34.834
YEAH, HE WAS.

17:34.875 --> 17:37.500
YOU KNOW, THERE'S NOT
TOO MANY OF THOSE AROUND.

17:37.542 --> 17:39.417
NO, THERE AREN'T.

17:48.125 --> 17:49.917
(knock on door)

17:49.959 --> 17:51.917
SO... ABOUT JANE FINCH.

17:51.959 --> 17:54.875
I KNOW YOU'RE EXPERIENCED
WITH THESE TYPES OF CASES,

17:54.917 --> 17:57.291
AND I APPRECIATE IT.
I'D LIKE TO SEE HER AGAIN.

17:57.333 --> 17:58.917
WELL, AS I UNDERSTAND IT,

17:58.959 --> 18:01.041
SHE'S ALREADY DONE
THE MANDATED THERAPY.

18:01.083 --> 18:03.417
I JUST NEED A SECOND
PSYCHIATRIST TO SIGN OFF

18:03.458 --> 18:06.125
TO MEET THE STANDARD OF CARE
REQUIREMENT.
(laughs) WELL,
I'M NOT A RUBBER STAMP.

18:06.166 --> 18:08.542
YOU REALLY HAVE
A PROBLEM HERE?

18:08.583 --> 18:11.041
JANE CUT HER WRISTS,
WHICH ON ITS OWN

18:11.083 --> 18:13.458
DOESN'T NECESSARILY
DISQUALIFY HER,

18:13.500 --> 18:15.458
BUT THE EXPLANATION
SHE GAVE HER FIRST THERAPIST,

18:15.500 --> 18:18.041
SHE REPEATED IT TO ME VERBATIM.
POINTS OFF FOR CONSISTENCY?

18:18.083 --> 18:19.458
NO, FOR BEING REHEARSED.

18:19.500 --> 18:22.041
SHE CAME INTO MY OFFICE,
SHE HAD ALL THE RIGHT ANSWERS,

18:22.083 --> 18:24.041
INCLUDING ABOUT
THE SUICIDE ATTEMPT.

18:24.083 --> 18:27.750
AND YOU THINK
SHE'S HIDING SOMETHING?
I NEED TO KNOW
THAT SHE ISN'T.

18:27.792 --> 18:30.041
HER "UP WITH PEOPLE" ATTITUDE
NOTWITHSTANDING,

18:30.083 --> 18:32.041
UNLESS JANE IS STABLE
WITH A REALISTIC APPRECIATION

18:32.083 --> 18:34.875
NOT ONLY OF WHO SHE IS
BUT WHO SHE'S GOING TO BECOME,

18:34.917 --> 18:39.041
GENDER REASSIGNMENT SURGERY
CAN DO MORE HARM THAN GOOD.
NOW ISN'T THAT A LOT
TO ASK OF SOMEONE

18:39.083 --> 18:41.875
WHO FEELS LIKE THEY'RE TRAPPED
IN THE WRONG BODY?

18:41.917 --> 18:44.458
IT'S LIKE DEMANDING
A SICK PERSON GET WELL

18:44.500 --> 18:47.041
BEFORE YOU GIVE 'EM
THE MEDICATION THEY NEED.
LOOK, I'M NOT SAYING NO.

18:47.083 --> 18:49.041
BUT THIS ISN'T A BOOB JOB
OR A TUMMY TUCK.

18:49.083 --> 18:51.041
WE'RE LOOKING AT A SURGERY
THAT IS FUNDAMENTALLY

18:51.083 --> 18:53.542
GONNA CHANGE
WHO JANE IS FOREVER.
A SURGERY
THAT SHE DESPERATELY WANTS,

18:53.583 --> 18:56.125
THAT SHE'S DONE EVERYTHING SHE'S
SUPPOSED TO TO GET READY FOR,

18:56.166 --> 18:58.750
AND THAT'S SCHEDULED
FOR THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW.

18:58.792 --> 19:00.834
SURGICAL TEAM IS PREPPED
AND READY TO GO.

19:00.875 --> 19:02.875
WELL, APOLOGIES
IF MY PROFESSIONAL JUDGMENT

19:02.917 --> 19:05.750
IS INCONVENIENCING YOU, OKAY?

19:05.792 --> 19:07.542
IS IT YOUR PROFESSIONAL
JUDGMENT, SHELDON?

19:07.583 --> 19:09.542
OR ARE YOU JUST
MAKING THIS DIFFICULT

19:09.583 --> 19:12.542
BECAUSE I PICKED COOPER
INSTEAD OF YOU?

19:12.583 --> 19:14.333
YOU SHOULD UNDERSTAND
TWO THINGS.

19:14.375 --> 19:16.125
FIRST, I'M RIGHT ABOUT JANE.

19:16.166 --> 19:18.041
SECOND, WE CAN BE
GOOD COLLEAGUES

19:18.083 --> 19:21.291
WITHOUT BEING GOOD FRIENDS
OR REALLY JUST FRIENDS AT ALL.

19:31.792 --> 19:33.125
HI.

19:33.166 --> 19:35.041
I DID WHAT DR. WILDER SAID.

19:35.083 --> 19:37.333
HE TOLD ME NOT TO GIVE HIM
POT ANYMORE, AND I DIDN'T.

19:37.375 --> 19:39.959
AND I THREW OUT WHAT I HAD LEFT,
BUT LOOK AT HIM.

19:40.000 --> 19:42.750
HE'S WORSE THAN BEFORE.
THIS IS PROBABLY
A REACTION TO HIM

19:42.792 --> 19:45.625
COMING OFF THE DRUG
SO QUICKLY.
I CAN'T, UH,
I CAN'T DO THIS ANYMORE.

19:45.667 --> 19:47.625
I NEED TO KNOW THIS PLAN.
WHICH PLAN?

19:47.667 --> 19:50.000
DR. WILDER, HE--HE CAME OVER
EARLIER, AND HE SAID

19:50.041 --> 19:53.041
THAT YOU WERE GONNA
FIND A WAY TO HELP US.

19:53.083 --> 19:55.166
(screaming)
NO, ZACK.

19:55.208 --> 19:57.375
HEY, ZACK. OKAY, OKAY.

19:57.417 --> 19:59.000
(continues screaming)
ZACK, COME HERE.

19:59.041 --> 20:02.166
OKAY. NO ONE'S GONNA HURT YOU,
BUT YOU HAVE TO TAKE IT EASY.

20:02.208 --> 20:05.375
I GOT YOU.
PLEASE GIVE HIM THE MARIJUANA.
IT WORKED. IT HELPED HIM.

20:05.417 --> 20:08.542
WE'LL FIND ANOTHER TREATMENT,
OKAY?
NO, BUT THAT COULD TAKE WEEKS
TO SEE RESULTS.

20:08.583 --> 20:10.542
I NEED HELP NOW.
WE'LL GET THROUGH IT.

20:10.583 --> 20:13.166
NO, WE WON'T. I WON'T.
(Zack screams)

20:13.208 --> 20:15.542
PLEASE JUST GIVE HIM
THE DRUGS.

20:15.583 --> 20:18.166
I'M SORRY. I CAN'T DO THAT.

20:18.208 --> 20:19.583
AAH!

20:19.625 --> 20:21.250
YOU TOLD ME
THIS SKIRT WORKED,

20:21.291 --> 20:23.834
SO I KNOW I'M NOT BACK HERE
FOR ANY BAD NEWS

20:23.875 --> 20:27.417

CUTE LITTLE HEAD SHRINKER.

20:27.458 --> 20:30.625
PLEASE, NO.

20:30.667 --> 20:32.041
(sighs)

20:32.083 --> 20:33.625
DR. WALLACE IS CONCERNED

20:33.667 --> 20:36.625
THAT YOU TOLD HIM WHAT
YOU THOUGHT HE'D WANT TO HEAR.

20:36.667 --> 20:39.208
AND THAT MAKES ME CRAZY?

20:39.250 --> 20:42.375

20:42.417 --> 20:45.166

27:55.959 --> 27:58.083
(exhales)

27:58.125 --> 28:01.000
HEY, I GOT YOUR TEXT.

28:01.041 --> 28:03.667
YEAH, UM... SO I SPENT
AN HOUR YESTERDAY

28:03.709 --> 28:06.000
WRESTLING ZACK
TO THE GROUND.
OH, IS HE OKAY?

28:06.041 --> 28:08.041
WELL, POT OR NO POT, HIS
EMOTIONS ARE ALL OVER THE PLACE.

28:08.083 --> 28:10.083
I GAVE HIM A SEDATIVE
TO CALM HIM DOWN

28:10.125 --> 28:12.250
SO SYDNEY COULD TAKE HIM HOME.

28:12.291 --> 28:14.458
BUT WHILE I AM TRYING TO FIND
A LONG-TERM SOLUTION,

28:14.500 --> 28:16.458
YOU'RE PROMISING HER
A QUICK FIX.

28:16.500 --> 28:19.875
UH, NO. WHAT I SAID WAS, YOU
WOULD FIND A WAY TO HELP ZACK.

28:19.917 --> 28:21.542
PARDON ME

28:21.583 --> 28:25.041
FOR HAVING SOME CONFIDENCE
IN YOUR MEDICAL ABILITIES.
STOP MEDDLING.

28:25.083 --> 28:27.667
STOP BARGING IN.

28:27.709 --> 28:29.041
WHAT?

28:29.083 --> 28:31.166
GIVE ME YOUR KEY
TO THE HOUSE, COOPER.

28:31.208 --> 28:33.166
(laughs) FORGET IT.
VIOLET GAVE IT TO ME.

28:33.208 --> 28:35.458
SHE'S THE ONLY ONE
WHO CAN ASK FOR IT BACK.

28:35.500 --> 28:38.291
(laughs) OH, FOR GOD SAKE.
WOULD YOU GROW UP, COOPER?
BELIEVE ME, I'LL BE SURE
TO KNOCK NEXT TIME.

28:38.333 --> 28:39.917
THE IMAGE OF YOUR ASS

28:39.959 --> 28:42.166
IS PERMANENTLY
BURNED INTO MY RETINAS.

28:42.208 --> 28:45.166
AND I'LL GROW THE HELL UP
WHEN YOU DO.
NO. UH, YOU GROW UP FIRST,
AND THEN I WILL GROW UP.

28:45.208 --> 28:47.166
NO, YOU GROW UP FIRST.
NO, YOU GROW UP FIRST.

28:47.208 --> 28:49.250
JUST GROW UP.
IF YOU GROW UP,
I'LL GROW UP.

28:49.291 --> 28:50.875
NO, GROW UP FIRST...

28:50.917 --> 28:52.875
I DON'T KNOW WHETHER
TO GIVE THEM BOXING GLOVES

28:52.917 --> 28:55.875
OR A TIME-OUT.
WELL, I KNOW THAT PETE
CAN TAKE A PUNCH.

28:55.917 --> 28:58.041
WELL, LATELY HE CAN'T TAKE
ANYTHING COMING FROM COOPER.

28:58.083 --> 29:01.500
YEAH, I HEARD ABOUT
THE ASS INCIDENT.
IT WAS NOT A BIG DEAL.

29:01.542 --> 29:03.583
WELL, IT WASN'T YOUR ASS.
HE CANNOT TELL ME
WHAT TO DO.

29:03.625 --> 29:05.583
MY PARENTS DID THAT
TO EACH OTHER, AND I--

29:05.625 --> 29:07.041
I HATED IT.

29:07.083 --> 29:10.041
HE'S THE MAN YOU LOVE.
HE'S ASKING YOU TO DO SOMETHING

29:10.083 --> 29:11.709
THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO HIM.

29:11.750 --> 29:13.291
THAT'S THE THING
ABOUT RELATIONSHIPS--

29:13.333 --> 29:16.375
EVEN IF IT'S NOT YOUR ASS,
YOU STILL HAVE TO CARE.

29:19.750 --> 29:21.542
YOU EITHER HAVE SOMETHING
AGAINST JANE

29:21.583 --> 29:23.542
OR SOMETHING AGAINST ME,
BECAUSE THAT WOMAN

29:23.583 --> 29:26.333
IS DAMNED IF SHE DOES AND DAMNED
IF SHE DOESN'T WITH YOU.
I WANT TO HELP HER.

29:26.375 --> 29:29.125
THEN SIGN OFF
ON ME DOING THE SURGERY.
YOU CAN GIVE HER
WHAT SHE WANTS, YES,

29:29.166 --> 29:31.542
BUT NOT WHAT SHE NEEDS.
I CAN CHANGE HER LIFE

29:31.583 --> 29:34.041
IN A WAY NO AMOUNT
OF JAWBONING EVER WILL.

29:34.083 --> 29:35.417
YOU REALLY THINK SO?

29:35.458 --> 29:37.917
A FEW FLICKS OF A SCALPEL,
REROUTE A LITTLE PLUMBING,

29:37.959 --> 29:40.041
AND ALL OF THE INSECURITY
AND SELF-LOATHING

29:40.083 --> 29:42.583
THAT BUILT UP OVER HER WHOLE
LIFETIME JUST--JUST DISAPPEARS?

29:42.625 --> 29:44.875
AT LEAST IT'S A START.

29:44.917 --> 29:47.000
WHY ARE YOU
SO INVESTED IN JANE?

29:49.917 --> 29:52.875
I GREW UP WITH A DADDY
WHO TOLD ME HOW SWEET I WAS,

29:52.917 --> 29:55.875
TAKING CARE OF TWO LITTLE
BROTHERS WHO STILL DEPEND ON ME.

29:55.917 --> 29:57.875
AND I BECAME A DOCTOR

29:57.917 --> 30:00.917
BECAUSE I COULDN'T IMAGINE
ANYTHING BETTER THAN A JOB

30:00.959 --> 30:04.583
WHERE, EVERY DAY,
YOU GOT TO HELP PEOPLE.

30:04.625 --> 30:06.542
(sighs)

30:06.583 --> 30:08.041
BUT SOMEHOW ALONG THE WAY,

30:08.083 --> 30:11.041
I DEVELOPED A REPUTATION
AS BEING COLD AND UNEMOTIONAL,

30:11.083 --> 30:12.917
AND NOW I'M THE BITCH.

30:12.959 --> 30:14.041
CHARLOTTE--

30:14.083 --> 30:16.500
YOU GONNA TELL ME
IT'S NOT THE CASE?

30:16.542 --> 30:17.917
(sighs)

30:17.959 --> 30:20.125
I'M NOT ASKING YOU
TO CRY FOR ME, SHELDON.

30:20.166 --> 30:23.125
I'M JUST ASKING YOU TO HELP ME
SPARE SOMEONE MORE PAIN.

30:23.166 --> 30:26.000
JANE'S HAD WAY MORE
THAN HER SHARE IN THIS LIFE.

30:27.625 --> 30:29.041

30:29.083 --> 30:32.834
YOU KEEP SHOWING OFF

30:32.875 --> 30:35.250
WE MIGHT ACTUALLY
BECOME FRIENDS AGAIN.

30:39.041 --> 30:41.041
(Cooper) WHAT HAPPENED?
(Zack screaming)

30:41.083 --> 30:43.083
HE STARTED AGAIN.
HE FLEW INTO A RAGE.

30:43.125 --> 30:45.959
HE STARTED HIMSELF
AND HITTING ME.
DID YOU GIVE HIM
ANYTHING, SYDNEY?

30:46.000 --> 30:48.792
I JUST--
I COULDN'T HANDLE IT ANYMORE.
WHAT'D YOU GIVE HIM?

30:48.834 --> 30:52.041
I BOUGHT SOME WEED
OFF THE STREET.

WHAT'S HAPPENING?
THE MARIJUANA YOU GAVE HIM
WAS LACED WITH P.C.P.

HE'S IN HYPERTENSIVE CRISIS.

30:58.000 --> 31:00.041
NO.

31:00.083 --> 31:02.625
