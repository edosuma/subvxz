00:15.417 --> 00:16.959
(Howard) Launch day, Cunningham!

00:17.041 --> 00:18.333
Weeks of waiting.

00:18.417 --> 00:20.000
Hours of standing.

00:20.083 --> 00:23.917
The McSatchle 299.99
is finally within our grasp!

00:24.000 --> 00:26.709
This satchel is going to change
everything!

00:26.792 --> 00:30.625
When people see we got a McSatchle,
they'll worship our cheese!

00:30.709 --> 00:33.166
(both) <i>McSatchle 299.99!</i>

00:33.250 --> 00:37.000
The two of us splitting one McSatchle
is the best idea we've ever had!

00:37.083 --> 00:38.083
Yeah, about that...

00:38.166 --> 00:39.959
Since I'm putting in most of the money,

00:40.041 --> 00:42.000
I'll take the McSatchle
Monday through Friday,

00:42.083 --> 00:43.250
and you can have it weekends!

00:43.333 --> 00:44.166
Weekends?

00:44.250 --> 00:46.875
How can I rub it in everyone's face
if no one sees me with it?

00:46.959 --> 00:48.083
I'll see you with it!

00:48.166 --> 00:50.333
And I'll be so jealous!

00:51.959 --> 00:53.208
(crowd cheering)

00:55.041 --> 00:56.625
(both giggling)

00:59.125 --> 01:00.917
Ooh...

01:04.041 --> 01:08.417
Hello. One McSatchle 299.99, please!

01:09.166 --> 01:12.750
Hmm, that'll be $299.99.

01:14.834 --> 01:17.834
Uh, you know
we just wanted one of 'em, right?

01:19.542 --> 01:22.500
Oh... That's the price.

01:22.583 --> 01:24.542
See, I thought it was the version number.

01:24.625 --> 01:28.458
In that case, I'd like to change
our order to none McSatchles, please.

01:29.542 --> 01:32.750
How are people gonna worship our cheese
if we don't have a McSatchle?

01:32.834 --> 01:34.667
I figured out how we can get the cash!

01:34.750 --> 01:35.917
Took ya long enough!

01:36.917 --> 01:38.417
Yow! That's genius!

01:38.500 --> 01:39.917
We'll become movie stars!

01:40.000 --> 01:41.458
We'll have tons of money!

01:41.542 --> 01:44.500
No, Howard, I was talking about the sign.

01:45.375 --> 01:48.458
Wait, you wanna get jobs?
Feels kinda sitcom-y.

01:48.542 --> 01:50.333
I'm not crazy about it either.

01:50.417 --> 01:52.875
I'll be working for my sworn enemy.

01:52.959 --> 01:54.458
But on the other hand...

01:54.542 --> 01:56.083
(all) <i>McSatchle!</i>

01:57.500 --> 02:00.834
-(beeping)
-(whirring)

02:00.917 --> 02:03.125
Uh, what's with the riffraff, Viceroy?

02:03.208 --> 02:05.625
It's my latest plan to stop the Ninja!

02:05.709 --> 02:09.083
My plan! But I'll allow it.

02:09.166 --> 02:11.792
As you know, today is the launch

02:11.875 --> 02:15.041
of the most coveted satchel
in handbag history...

02:15.125 --> 02:16.667
The McSatchle.

02:16.750 --> 02:19.041
What, you mean this old thing?

02:19.125 --> 02:20.875
(dance music plays)

02:20.959 --> 02:24.375
My Punk-Bots have been programmed
to rouse rabble at the McSac Store.

02:24.458 --> 02:28.917
They'll lure the Ninja close,
and we'll hit him with my big surprise.

02:29.000 --> 02:30.500
Don't you mean my big surprise!

02:30.583 --> 02:33.041
Do you even know
what your big surprise is?

02:33.125 --> 02:35.125
Don't tell me! You'll ruin the surprise!

02:37.000 --> 02:37.834
Yeah!

02:37.917 --> 02:40.041
Let's disrupt some commerce, eh, lads?

02:40.125 --> 02:42.458
Rock-n-roll!

02:42.542 --> 02:43.917
It's raining pain!

02:44.000 --> 02:47.125
(laughing) That's not yours anymore.

02:48.208 --> 02:49.083
Thievery!

02:49.166 --> 02:51.125
(screaming)

02:51.208 --> 02:53.375
Give me that! Nice bag, pops.

02:53.458 --> 02:55.500
Random destruction!

02:55.583 --> 02:58.083
I had five minutes left on that meter!

02:59.667 --> 03:01.583
This is the hardest thing ever!

03:01.667 --> 03:05.166
We just have to stick it out until
we got enough money for a McSatchle!

03:05.250 --> 03:06.709
(man) Hey, tickie rippers.

03:06.792 --> 03:09.417
Report to the big room
for gum scraping duty.

03:09.500 --> 03:10.375
(chuckles)

03:10.458 --> 03:12.542
(grunts) I hate working, Cunningham!

03:12.625 --> 03:14.333
It's the Anti-Bruce!

03:14.417 --> 03:16.291
Just remember, we're in this together.

03:16.375 --> 03:18.291
To the end.

03:18.375 --> 03:20.333
-(humming sound)
-Oh, thank cheese!

03:20.417 --> 03:21.750
Nice timing, Nomicon!

03:21.834 --> 03:23.041
Why don't you get scraping,

03:23.125 --> 03:25.125
and I'll be there as soon
as humanly vloomp-able.

03:25.208 --> 03:27.000
What about "together to the end"?

03:31.417 --> 03:32.250
(bird coos)

03:32.333 --> 03:34.333
(both exclaiming)

03:38.917 --> 03:41.750
(screaming)

03:41.834 --> 03:44.458
"The gain is rarely worth the loss."

03:44.542 --> 03:48.000
NinjaNomicon, I'm trying to get a bag
that will make people worship our cheese,

03:48.083 --> 03:50.500
so if we could do
this whole gainy-lossy thing later,

03:50.583 --> 03:52.625
that would be Brucely appreciated.

03:54.834 --> 03:57.750
Ah! Stop that! Stop it!

03:57.834 --> 04:00.000
Stupid Shoobingham,
leaving me to scrape gum

04:00.083 --> 04:02.458
while he's in the bathroom
shloompin' his Nomicon.

04:03.709 --> 04:04.625
What'cha doin'?

04:04.709 --> 04:06.000
What's it look like I'm doin'?

04:06.083 --> 04:07.291
I'm on a treasure hunt!

04:07.375 --> 04:11.208
McFist hid video game tokens
under random wads of gum!

04:11.291 --> 04:12.750
I've found five so far!

04:12.834 --> 04:13.917
For serious?

04:14.000 --> 04:15.375
Can I take a scrape at it?

04:17.041 --> 04:18.959
Be my guest.

04:19.041 --> 04:21.125
Nope. Nope.

04:22.208 --> 04:24.041
-Nope, nope...
-(video game plays)

04:24.125 --> 04:27.125
The McFist-A-Plex
McManager's Lounge will give us

04:27.208 --> 04:29.750
the perfect view of my robo-rousers.

04:29.834 --> 04:31.625
(grunts) You mean my robo-rousers!

04:31.709 --> 04:32.917
We still doing this?

04:33.000 --> 04:34.792
Keep scraping!

04:34.875 --> 04:37.041
Those tokens
aren't going to find themselves!

04:37.125 --> 04:39.000
That kid reminds me of someone.

04:39.083 --> 04:41.166
Someone I like.

04:41.250 --> 04:43.083
(chuckles) I found a quarter!

04:46.291 --> 04:47.291
I found a quarter!

04:47.375 --> 04:49.083
Oh, that's right... me!

04:49.166 --> 04:52.250
Son, how'd you like to be McManager?

04:52.333 --> 04:54.291
-But sir, I'm...
-Fired!

04:54.375 --> 04:55.917
That's what you are, Bryce!

04:56.000 --> 04:58.542
Now go take a smile somewhere else.
What's your name?

04:58.625 --> 05:01.875
Doesn't matter,
I'll call you "Young Hannibal."

05:03.917 --> 05:05.458
Hey, Howard, sorry about that.

05:05.542 --> 05:07.083
Nomicon was jabbering gains and losses

05:07.166 --> 05:09.667
and blah-blah...
Why are you wearing a tuxedo?

05:09.750 --> 05:11.500
I've been promoted.

05:11.583 --> 05:13.041
You made McManager?

05:13.125 --> 05:14.750
This is Bruce-diggity!

05:14.834 --> 05:18.625
Now we can slack off,
get paid and buy a McSatchle!

05:18.709 --> 05:20.291
Slappage!

05:20.375 --> 05:23.500
But first I'm gonna need you
to plunge the second floor bathroom

05:23.583 --> 05:24.917
<i>and squeegee the butter traps.</i>

05:25.000 --> 05:28.667
(laughing) Sure,
I'll get right on that, Mr. McManager.

05:28.750 --> 05:32.125
Or was it plunge the butter traps
and squeegee the bathroom?

05:32.208 --> 05:35.208
-(both laughing)
-Why don't I plunge and squeegee 'em both?

05:35.291 --> 05:36.458
Good call.

05:37.125 --> 05:39.208
(grunts) Huh?
Wait a second, you're serious?

05:39.291 --> 05:41.000
You said we should get jobs.

05:41.083 --> 05:44.166
Turns out my job is... being your boss.

05:44.250 --> 05:46.208
You are not the boss of me!

05:46.291 --> 05:47.917
This name tag says otherwise.

05:48.000 --> 05:50.291
That name tag says "Bryce"!

05:50.375 --> 05:51.834
Cunningham, please don't make me

05:51.917 --> 05:54.542
fire you before we've saved
enough for the McSatchle.

05:54.625 --> 05:56.000
And about that,

05:56.083 --> 05:57.709
now that I'm making more money than you,

05:57.792 --> 06:00.166
I'll be taking our McSatchle
Monday through Saturday.

06:00.250 --> 06:01.500
The juice you will!

06:01.583 --> 06:03.083
Don't worry.

06:03.166 --> 06:04.792
You can have it on Sundays.

06:04.875 --> 06:06.875
Well, every other Sunday.

06:06.959 --> 06:09.083
(groans)

06:09.166 --> 06:12.458
That butter trap
ain't gonna squeegee-plunge itself.

06:12.542 --> 06:13.709
(growls)

06:22.917 --> 06:24.583
(toilet flushes)

06:37.583 --> 06:41.000
(Howard) Ooh, sorry, Cunningham.

06:41.083 --> 06:43.000
That's next week's film.

06:43.083 --> 06:46.041
This week's is, <i>Winky Face: The Movie.</i>

06:46.125 --> 06:48.458
I probably should've checked
before you did all that.

06:48.542 --> 06:52.125
-Mmm.
-You are the jerkiest boss ever!

06:52.208 --> 06:54.709
Attention shoppers,
there's a sale on anarchy!

06:54.792 --> 06:56.625
-(laughing)
-Give me that!

06:56.709 --> 06:58.959
-(crying)
-Rock-n-roll!

06:59.041 --> 07:01.583
It's Ninja o'clock.

07:01.667 --> 07:06.291
Actually, your break's in 20 minutes,
so if Ninja o'clock could happen then,

07:06.375 --> 07:08.000
that'd be super.

07:08.083 --> 07:09.959
-(screaming)
-You cannot tell me when to Ninja!

07:10.041 --> 07:12.000
Hello. McManager.

07:12.083 --> 07:13.667
You know what? I quit.

07:13.750 --> 07:15.083
What about our McSatchle?

07:15.166 --> 07:17.875
There is no "our McSatchle"!

07:19.041 --> 07:19.959
(groans)

07:21.291 --> 07:22.667
-(Randy) Smokebomb!
-(grunts)

07:23.834 --> 07:25.125
(roaring)

07:27.125 --> 07:28.458
(grunting)

07:28.542 --> 07:31.625
Can't believe Cunningham
disrespected my cheese like that!

07:32.959 --> 07:33.792
(beeps)

07:35.041 --> 07:36.583
(giggling)

07:36.667 --> 07:38.375
Yes! My plan is working!

07:38.458 --> 07:39.333
Plan?

07:39.417 --> 07:42.125
I didn't see anything on the break room
bulletin board about a plan.

07:42.208 --> 07:44.625
Isn't this where you
spring "your" surprise?

07:44.709 --> 07:46.917
Of course, my surprise...

07:47.000 --> 07:49.750
Uh... Really excited about my surprise.

07:49.834 --> 07:51.458
Think you're gonna love it, and... Ohh.

07:52.542 --> 07:55.125
(all grunting)

07:55.208 --> 07:57.291
(karate yells)

07:57.375 --> 07:59.625
-(shouting)
-(groaning)

07:59.709 --> 08:01.959
-(stammering)
-Oh, I'll do it!

08:02.041 --> 08:03.041
-(device beeps)
-What?

08:05.500 --> 08:07.291
-(zipping sound)
-(gasps)

08:09.458 --> 08:11.959
-What the juice?
-(roars)

08:12.041 --> 08:13.875
Whoa! Did not see that coming.

08:13.959 --> 08:15.750
-Surprise!
-(roaring)

08:15.834 --> 08:18.458
Ninja Rings!

08:19.208 --> 08:20.458
Ninja Chain-sickle!

08:22.125 --> 08:24.208
Ninja what's going on?

08:24.291 --> 08:27.750
I constructed Giant
Punk-Bot's armor from McSatchle.

08:27.834 --> 08:28.750
Why would you do that?

08:28.834 --> 08:31.208
Because McSatchles are indestructible!

08:31.291 --> 08:33.917
(chuckling)

08:34.000 --> 08:36.083
Yeah... about that.

08:36.166 --> 08:39.834
In order to lower costs,
we went with a cheaper zipper.

08:39.917 --> 08:42.500
-It's highly destructible.
-You did what?

08:42.583 --> 08:45.208
Gee... Surprise!

08:45.291 --> 08:47.333
(gasps) I gotta tell Cunningham!

08:47.417 --> 08:50.000
Although he did disrespect my cheese.

08:50.083 --> 08:52.333
Hmm. What to do... What to do...

08:52.417 --> 08:54.458
-(groans)
-(roars)

08:54.542 --> 08:57.000
-(music plays)
-(laughing) Yeah!

08:57.083 --> 08:57.959
(music stops)

08:59.250 --> 09:01.959
Tengu Fire Ball.

09:05.500 --> 09:06.917
(grunting)

09:07.667 --> 09:08.500
Oh, boy.

09:10.250 --> 09:13.166
Yes! Eat 'Satchle, Ninja!

09:13.250 --> 09:16.458
-Hey, jerk, I need to tell you something.
-Hey, jerk, not listening.

09:16.542 --> 09:19.041
Why's Young Hannibal talking to the Ninja?

09:19.125 --> 09:20.959
That's against company policy!

09:21.041 --> 09:24.208
Listen, I'm not speaking to you either,
but I have to tell you this!

09:24.291 --> 09:26.583
What, Howard?
You need me to come back in there

09:26.667 --> 09:28.333
and beat the farts
out of the theater seats?

09:28.417 --> 09:31.542
No! Besides,
you can't do that. I fired you.

09:31.625 --> 09:33.583
You didn't fire me! I quit!

09:33.667 --> 09:35.000
Would you just listen to me!

09:35.083 --> 09:36.750
That thing's made out of McSatchles!

09:36.834 --> 09:38.417
And McFist skimped on the zips!

09:38.500 --> 09:43.041
So what you're saying is...
they tried to sell us horky McSatchles?

09:43.125 --> 09:44.500
I know!

09:44.583 --> 09:47.333
Also, you can probably beat
that thing by stabbing it in the zipper.

09:47.417 --> 09:50.709
Hey, buddy,
you just McManaged to save the day.

09:50.792 --> 09:52.834
Why do you say things like that?

09:55.709 --> 09:57.291
Huh! Yah!

09:57.375 --> 09:58.709
Ninja Slice!

09:58.792 --> 09:59.959
(unzipping sound)

10:01.041 --> 10:02.709
(shouting)

10:07.625 --> 10:08.792
Ninja Hot Balls!

10:08.875 --> 10:10.750
(screaming)

10:10.834 --> 10:13.041
Not rock-n-roll, mate.

10:13.125 --> 10:14.917
Hi-yah!

10:15.000 --> 10:17.500
-(gasps)
-Your plan failed.

10:17.583 --> 10:18.875
Not a surprise!

10:20.333 --> 10:21.959
So I got fired. (chuckles) Yeah.

10:22.041 --> 10:24.041
Turns out McFist has a very strict

10:24.125 --> 10:26.834
anti-chatting-up-the-Ninja policy.

10:26.917 --> 10:30.166
Sorry you lost your job, but I couldn't
have stopped that thing without you.

10:30.834 --> 10:32.041
-Hmm...
-(gasps)

10:34.083 --> 10:35.333
You know, it's weird.

10:35.417 --> 10:38.208
Usually the Nomicon's jibber-jabber
comes back to help me out,

10:38.291 --> 10:39.375
but not this time.

10:40.792 --> 10:42.083
(gasps)

10:42.166 --> 10:43.709
<i>♪ Best friends ♪</i>

10:43.792 --> 10:45.667
Why are you looking at me like that?

10:45.750 --> 10:50.417
We were so desperate to gain a McSatchle,
we almost lost our friendship.

10:50.500 --> 10:51.667
So not worth it.

10:51.750 --> 10:53.625
'Cause of the horky zips, right?

10:53.709 --> 10:56.333
Right, Howard. The horky zips.

10:56.417 --> 10:58.959
Friendship, now that's rock-n-roll.

11:02.083 --> 11:03.291
(Randy) That's awful!

11:03.375 --> 11:06.625
Your Uncle Nooge is going to jail
for a crime he didn't commit?

11:06.709 --> 11:09.375
You completely
missed the point of that story:

11:09.458 --> 11:12.583
I got two free tickets
to Whoopee World this weekend!

11:12.667 --> 11:14.625
-You in?
-So in!

11:14.709 --> 11:16.834
(chuckles) I was afraid you'd say that.

11:16.917 --> 11:21.208
See, we both know that once we get
to Whoopee World, you'll spot McFist and

11:21.291 --> 11:22.875
be all,
"He must be up to something..."

11:22.959 --> 11:24.750
McFist! He must be up to something!

11:24.834 --> 11:27.083
And then, boom, you're gone-zo.

11:27.166 --> 11:30.208
And I'll look like a total shoob
standing there talking to myself.

11:30.291 --> 11:32.083
Bup-bup-bup... Let me finish.

11:39.667 --> 11:41.083
(quacks)

11:42.291 --> 11:44.125
(man) No way!

11:44.208 --> 11:45.959
It's my baby bro, Hannie!

11:46.041 --> 11:48.500
What brings you here, bro-mo-sapien?

11:48.583 --> 11:50.083
Terry, I faxed you this morning!

11:50.166 --> 11:53.750
Adam, dude,
why didn't you tell me I got a fax, man?

11:53.834 --> 11:54.875
(burps)

11:54.959 --> 11:56.583
(groans) This is awful.

11:56.667 --> 11:59.208
-I hate coming here.
-You know the dealio.

11:59.291 --> 12:02.750
-Terry is the heir to McFist Industries.
-(flatulence under water)

12:02.834 --> 12:05.667
Once a year he needs to sign
the company over to you.

12:05.750 --> 12:08.625
That guy is not McFist's big brother.

12:08.709 --> 12:10.792
-(squeaking sound)
-Wet willy, man!

12:10.875 --> 12:13.667
That guy is so McFist's big brother!

12:13.750 --> 12:16.750
(squirming)
Would you just sign the paper?

12:16.834 --> 12:20.000
I wanna rap at 'cha first,
about something important.

12:20.083 --> 12:22.000
(groans) Here comes the wind-power...

12:22.083 --> 12:24.000
Wind power!

12:24.083 --> 12:27.208
It's the future, man,
all the way from the past!

12:27.291 --> 12:32.709
If we ran things on wind,
the whole world could take her breezy.

12:32.792 --> 12:34.583
Sign the paper!

12:35.709 --> 12:37.792
-(burps)
-(groans)

12:37.875 --> 12:40.291
I'll go get the backup
document from the hovercraft.

12:40.375 --> 12:41.917
All right!

12:42.000 --> 12:44.291
Grab a loofah,
you can scrub my can't-reachies!

12:45.041 --> 12:46.875
Viceroy, I'll help you!

12:46.959 --> 12:48.959
(chuckles) This is huge!

12:49.041 --> 12:51.208
If Terry doesn't sign that paper,
McFist will be gone

12:51.291 --> 12:53.208
and I'll never have
to worry about him again!

12:53.291 --> 12:55.125
Ninja Enemy Take Down!

12:57.625 --> 12:59.125
(humming)

12:59.208 --> 13:01.083
(groans) Fine NinjaNomicon,
but make it fast!

13:07.750 --> 13:10.875
"The unknown ally can be more
dangerous than the known enemy."

13:15.417 --> 13:19.583
I hear ya, Nomicon, and normally I'd be
all "totally" but have you seen Terry?

13:19.667 --> 13:24.125
This unknown ally isn't dangerous, he's
a majorly chill bree-brah, bro, you know.

13:25.208 --> 13:27.000
(shouting)

13:28.750 --> 13:30.291
No! Adam, stop it!

13:32.041 --> 13:34.625
Ninja! What are you doin' here?

13:34.709 --> 13:35.792
You come by for a soak?

13:35.875 --> 13:37.625
What? A soak? No, I'm good.

13:37.709 --> 13:40.166
Listen, Terry, you can't sign that paper.

13:40.250 --> 13:43.041
But then I'd be
running McFist Industries...

13:43.125 --> 13:45.291
Yes! Perfect! You should do that!

13:45.375 --> 13:48.959
Sorry, Ninj, I am not a businessman.

13:49.041 --> 13:54.000
It's like my dad used to say:
"Terry, you are not a businessman."

13:54.083 --> 13:56.000
This is your chance to prove him wrong.

13:56.083 --> 14:00.917
With you in charge,
Norrisville could run on... wind power.

14:01.000 --> 14:04.208
We could finally take her breezy...

14:04.291 --> 14:05.625
(flatulence under water)

14:05.709 --> 14:07.542
(McFist groans)

14:07.625 --> 14:09.834
Enough with the dude stew, Terry.

14:09.917 --> 14:11.208
It's time to sign the paper!

14:11.959 --> 14:13.917
What do you mean you won't sign?

14:14.000 --> 14:18.291
In conclusion,
if you can guarantee we'll bro out all day

14:18.375 --> 14:20.458
without McFist wonkin' up our fun,

14:20.542 --> 14:22.375
then I'll take you to Whoopee World.

14:22.458 --> 14:25.000
Howard... I guarantee it.

14:25.083 --> 14:27.291
So you're saying
I was standing at my locker

14:27.375 --> 14:30.667
talking to myself like a shoob
for 20 minutes?

14:30.750 --> 14:33.041
You completely
missed the point of the story:

14:33.125 --> 14:36.041
I replaced my enemy
with a peace lovin' nicewad!

14:36.125 --> 14:37.792
No way this can go wrong.

The world's first
wind-powered amusement park!

14:51.125 --> 14:54.250
(lots of flatulence)

14:55.417 --> 14:57.750
Wind power is fart power!

14:57.834 --> 15:00.125
This is amaze-dingles!

15:00.208 --> 15:04.333
That's the sound
of the smell of the future, boys.

15:04.417 --> 15:09.000
(chuckles) Man, I had no idea
that being a businessman was so easy.

15:09.083 --> 15:11.000
Howard,
I never thought I'd get to say this,

15:11.083 --> 15:14.792
but let's go check fart-powered
bumper cars off our bucket list.

15:14.875 --> 15:16.500
(both laughing)

15:16.583 --> 15:21.125
I don't know how I did it, but Windeee
World is now 100 percent wind-powered.

15:21.208 --> 15:24.041
OK, I know how I did it. I'm a genius!

15:24.959 --> 15:26.125
Whoopie!

15:26.208 --> 15:29.041
I'd like to cash in one
of my complimentary hug coupons.

15:29.125 --> 15:30.500
Get off me!

15:30.583 --> 15:32.375
Hannibal! What are you doing here?

15:32.458 --> 15:35.250
Watching my older brother ruin my empire!

15:35.333 --> 15:36.792
Stupid wind power!

15:36.875 --> 15:39.500
(crying)

15:39.583 --> 15:42.458
I'm gonna hit you so hard,
you're gonna forget your name!

15:42.542 --> 15:44.959
I'm gonna hit you so hard,
you're gonna forget you said that!

15:45.041 --> 15:46.417
(both) Fart power!

-(mooing)

15:52.583 --> 15:54.750
Fart power!

15:58.583 --> 16:00.375
-Fart power?
-(groans)

16:04.000 --> 16:05.291
(horn blares)

16:05.375 --> 16:07.750
-Stupid fart power!
-This place stinks!

16:07.834 --> 16:10.583
Un-amusement park zing!

16:10.667 --> 16:12.625
Double zing for the win!

16:12.709 --> 16:14.250
Shoob.

16:14.333 --> 16:16.083
Come on, leave Bucky alone.

16:16.166 --> 16:18.000
I was talking about you, Cunningham!

16:18.083 --> 16:20.834
By taking down McFist
you ruined Whoopee World!

16:20.917 --> 16:23.458
-Shoob.
-That's not true.

16:23.542 --> 16:27.000
Is that true? Howard, wait. No, come back,
Howard! Come back please!

16:27.083 --> 16:29.667
(indistinct chatter)

16:29.750 --> 16:32.000
Why's everyone bummin', V-Nasty?

16:32.083 --> 16:36.750
Our "generators" aren't breaking
enough wind to power the park.

16:36.834 --> 16:37.917
(slurping sound)

16:38.000 --> 16:41.458
Hey, Terry, guess who I am right now:
"Son, you are no businessman!"

16:41.542 --> 16:45.291
Here's a hint, I'm Dad! (laughs)

16:45.375 --> 16:47.500
(chuckles) I'm not done yet!

16:47.583 --> 16:50.667
Actually, if we don't find
an alternate source of wind, we are.

16:50.750 --> 16:55.959
Sign the paper and I'll clean up
your mess, just like I always have.

16:56.041 --> 16:59.125
-(evil laugh)
-(flatulence)

16:59.208 --> 17:00.875
Oh, excuse me.

17:00.959 --> 17:04.041
These organic prune smoothies
really pack a punch.

17:04.125 --> 17:07.375
(lots of flatulence)

17:11.250 --> 17:13.458
Gather the Man-Droids, V-Diggity.

17:13.542 --> 17:17.667
I think I know where we can score
ourselves some major windage.

17:20.667 --> 17:23.291
Care for a free prune smoothie, man?

17:23.375 --> 17:25.208
Better make it a double.

17:25.291 --> 17:27.458

17:33.625 --> 17:36.333

17:36.417 --> 17:38.834
Howard? Where are you?

17:38.917 --> 17:39.875
(sniffs, groans)

17:39.959 --> 17:41.250
You were here.

17:41.333 --> 17:44.709
And recently.
What the smoothie is going on?

17:49.375 --> 17:51.709
I'm thinking it's Ninja time.

17:51.792 --> 17:53.500
-(electric zapping)
-Ah! Ooh!

17:53.583 --> 17:56.458
I really tooted my own horn there,
didn't I?

17:56.542 --> 17:58.166
Butt trumpet zing!

18:00.625 --> 18:03.125
(flatulence continues)

18:06.291 --> 18:07.375

18:12.625 --> 18:16.041

18:16.125 --> 18:17.709

18:17.792 --> 18:21.583
Today, Whoopee World,
tomorrow the world world!

18:21.667 --> 18:22.834
This is your plan?

18:22.917 --> 18:25.250
To hook the entire planet
up to fart-catchers?

18:25.333 --> 18:27.125
Yepper doodles!

18:27.208 --> 18:31.792
And I'm going to be
the king of Fart-topia!

18:31.875 --> 18:34.709
Gonna have to call smokebomb on that.

18:34.792 --> 18:36.667
Ninja, bro, check it!

18:36.750 --> 18:38.959
I did what you said.
I took over the company!

18:39.041 --> 18:40.417
That was your idea?

18:40.500 --> 18:42.583
Well, yeah,
but I didn't know he was gonna...

18:42.667 --> 18:44.917
I mean there...
I didn't know there were gonna be farts.

18:45.000 --> 18:46.709
-Ninja, you gotta save us!
-(flatulence)

18:46.792 --> 18:48.208
It's over, Terry.

18:48.291 --> 18:51.083
It'd be way cooler if it wasn't, you know.

18:55.875 --> 18:59.500
That means get him,
you peace-lovin' trash compactors!

18:59.583 --> 19:01.083

19:02.125 --> 19:04.041

19:16.458 --> 19:19.250
Aw, it's over, man!

19:20.125 --> 19:21.500
(whispering)

19:22.667 --> 19:24.667
It's back on, man!

19:27.250 --> 19:29.000
You just couldn't help yourself,
could you?

19:29.083 --> 19:34.458
All the guy wanted was a commercial grade
fart-catcher and you gave him a robo-tick!

19:34.542 --> 19:37.875
Mother says overachieving
is one of my finest qualities.

19:39.208 --> 19:40.208
(shouts)

19:46.083 --> 19:49.959
Yeah, man! Yeah! Spark up that Ninja, man!

19:50.041 --> 19:51.625
(howling)

19:51.709 --> 19:54.125
OK, so swapping McFists was epically wonk.

19:54.208 --> 19:55.375
And I want to make it right.

19:55.458 --> 19:57.083
How do I make it right?

19:57.166 --> 20:00.125
"The unknown ally can be more
dangerous than the known enemy."

20:03.041 --> 20:05.291
I thought my unknown ally
wasn't dangerous,

20:05.375 --> 20:08.250
but it turns out he's more dangerous
than my known enemy.

20:08.333 --> 20:12.417
Which means... My known enemy
is actually my unknown ally!

20:12.500 --> 20:13.500
It's all so simple!

20:14.417 --> 20:16.250
Hey, McFist, think fast!

20:16.333 --> 20:18.500
Wait, what'd he say? Stink last?

20:21.166 --> 20:23.625
Eat Ninja Hot Balls!

20:25.458 --> 20:26.625
Yah!

20:28.667 --> 20:30.709
Aww, bummer, dude.

20:32.291 --> 20:35.125
-(mooing)
-(dinging)

20:35.208 --> 20:38.625
-(groaning)
-What have I done?

20:38.709 --> 20:40.291
I tried to take her breezy,

20:40.375 --> 20:44.625
but instead I became the last thing
I ever wanted to be: a McFist.

20:44.709 --> 20:46.458
Dad was right.

20:46.542 --> 20:49.792
Being a businessman
ain't my business, man.

20:49.875 --> 20:53.375
Listen, Terry,
you may not be a businessman,

20:53.458 --> 20:56.166
but I could never be a... uh, er...

20:56.250 --> 20:57.792
What are you anyway, a dead beat?

20:57.875 --> 20:59.834

20:59.917 --> 21:01.417
That means a lot.

21:01.500 --> 21:03.625

21:05.083 --> 21:08.583
Man, that is a load off. I'm telling you.

21:08.667 --> 21:09.834

21:09.917 --> 21:12.125

21:12.208 --> 21:14.125
It's you and me again, McFist.

21:14.208 --> 21:17.750
Guess I don't exist. I'm just
the guy who builds stuff, you know.

21:17.834 --> 21:19.917
Give it a rest would ya!

21:20.000 --> 21:22.667
Honestly, Ninja,
it's been kind of a long day.

21:22.750 --> 21:24.875
What do ya say we start fresh tomorrow?

21:24.959 --> 21:28.041
I say... smokebomb!

21:28.125 --> 21:30.709
Cunningham,
let's talk about what you learned today.

21:30.792 --> 21:33.875
