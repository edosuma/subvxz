WEBVTT

00:02.001 --> 00:05.546
NARRATOR: From deep beneath
the earth they appear.

00:05.547 --> 00:07.798
JOHN RHODES: He encountered
some sort of a creature

00:07.799 --> 00:09.466
lurking back in the dark.

00:09.467 --> 00:11.301
NARRATOR:
Part human...

00:11.302 --> 00:13.512
part serpent.

00:13.513 --> 00:14.888
MICHAEL SALLA:
There are many stories

00:14.889 --> 00:18.559
of people encountering
lizard men or snake people.

00:18.560 --> 00:22.855
NARRATOR: Could the ancient
legends describing snakelike gods

00:22.856 --> 00:24.565
really be true?

00:24.566 --> 00:26.275
RABBI ARIEL BAR TZADOK:
There's always been talk

00:26.276 --> 00:29.486
about a reptilian race.

00:29.487 --> 00:32.238
Whether it's angelic
or extraterrestrial.

00:32.240 --> 00:35.409
NARRATOR:
Could they still be among us,

00:35.410 --> 00:38.078
hiding in plain sight?

00:38.079 --> 00:41.081
DAVID CHILDRESS: Serpent
people are seen coming out

00:41.082 --> 00:42.916
- of these tunnels, right?
- JORGE DELGADO: Yes.

00:42.917 --> 00:44.251
NARRATOR:
And if so,

00:44.252 --> 00:46.879
what is their agenda?

00:46.880 --> 00:50.424
WILLIAM HENRY: Perhaps they're
awaiting a time to arise

00:50.425 --> 00:52.218
to take control of humanity.

00:55.263 --> 00:57.264
NARRATOR:
There is a doorway

00:57.265 --> 00:59.975
in the universe.

00:59.976 --> 01:02.729
Beyond it is
the promise of truth.

01:04.188 --> 01:06.815
It demands
we question everything

01:06.816 --> 01:09.443
we have ever been taught.

01:09.444 --> 01:12.946
The evidence is all around us.

01:12.947 --> 01:16.867
The future is
right before our eyes.

01:16.868 --> 01:19.453
We are not alone.

01:19.454 --> 01:22.707
We have never <i> been</i> alone.

01:31.633 --> 01:33.218
NARRATOR:
Bethesda, Maryland.

01:34.594 --> 01:37.596
1960.

01:37.597 --> 01:41.767
American neurobiologist
Paul MacLean proposes

01:41.768 --> 01:44.812
a revolutionary model
of human brain anatomy

01:44.813 --> 01:48.148
called the triune brain model.

01:48.149 --> 01:50.776
It distinguishes
evolutionary remnants

01:50.777 --> 01:52.486
of what MacLean refers to...

01:52.487 --> 01:54.947
as the reptilian brain.

01:54.948 --> 01:57.366
Paul MacLean was
a noted neurobiologist

01:57.367 --> 01:59.535
who came up with a,
a model called

01:59.536 --> 02:01.246
the triune brain,
three-part brain.

02:03.331 --> 02:05.791
One part of the brain
was reptilian,

02:05.792 --> 02:09.294
one mammalian, and one primate.

02:09.294 --> 02:12.881
Distinct areas of the brain
with different functions.

02:12.882 --> 02:16.176
The reptilian
was particularly important.

02:16.177 --> 02:19.763
MacLean suggested this was
earlier in evolution,

02:19.764 --> 02:23.142
perhaps the first brain,
and had more primal functions.

02:23.143 --> 02:24.977
Fear, rage.

02:24.978 --> 02:27.938
NARRATOR:
The idea ignites a firestorm

02:27.939 --> 02:30.816
of public interest,
putting into question

02:30.817 --> 02:34.695
conventional theories
about human evolution.

02:34.696 --> 02:36.280
YOUNG:
This was in the 1960s.

02:36.281 --> 02:39.741
And the triune brain
captured the imagination

02:39.742 --> 02:41.702
of the intellectual class.

02:41.703 --> 02:45.038
Even Carl Sagan commented on it.

02:45.039 --> 02:50.043
NARRATOR: Nearly six
decades later in 2018,

02:50.044 --> 02:52.546
reptile neuroscientist
Gilles Laurent

02:52.547 --> 02:55.090
and his team
at the Max Planck Institute

02:55.091 --> 02:59.720
publish a landmark study in
the journal <i> Science</i> reexamining

02:59.721 --> 03:02.931
the idea of a reptilian
component to the brain.

03:02.932 --> 03:05.350
YOUNG:
Gilles Laurent challenged

03:05.351 --> 03:08.061
MacLean's model
and found the brain

03:08.062 --> 03:11.231
is not so tidy,
the locations are not so clear.

03:11.232 --> 03:13.901
But he also found
there was similarity

03:13.902 --> 03:15.611
in the chemical function

03:15.612 --> 03:18.071
of the reptile brain
and the human brain.

03:18.072 --> 03:19.490
That was unexpected.

03:21.242 --> 03:23.410
NARRATOR:
Evolutionary biologists have

03:23.411 --> 03:26.580
long proposed that many
human traits, including

03:26.581 --> 03:28.582
the amniotic birth sac,

03:28.583 --> 03:30.751
the layering system of our skin,

03:30.752 --> 03:32.920
and even our hearing,

03:32.921 --> 03:36.590
can be traced back
to a common reptilian ancestor.

03:36.591 --> 03:37.883
(growling)

03:37.884 --> 03:39.301
KIRSTEN FISHER:
Many of our features,

03:39.302 --> 03:43.263
like our skin, our teeth,
our hair, our nails,

03:43.264 --> 03:44.932
as things with backbones

03:44.933 --> 03:47.351
in sort of the grand
evolutionary scheme of things,

03:47.352 --> 03:50.771
we're relatively closely related
to modern reptiles.

03:50.772 --> 03:53.357
NARRATOR:
Is it possible that the most

03:53.358 --> 03:55.901
significant advancements
in human development

03:55.902 --> 03:57.611
didn't evolve from primates,

03:57.612 --> 04:00.155
as was proposed
by Charles Darwin,

04:00.156 --> 04:02.783
but from reptiles?

04:02.784 --> 04:06.954
Humans and reptiles
share a lot of traits.

04:06.955 --> 04:10.791
For example, uh, we have
these recessive genes in us

04:10.792 --> 04:13.085
that are expressed on occasion.

04:13.086 --> 04:16.630
When we're in the womb,
we actually have a tail.

04:16.630 --> 04:18.966
And the tail disappears

04:18.966 --> 04:21.301
and it becomes the end
of our vertebrae,

04:21.302 --> 04:22.844
down by the bottom of our back.

04:22.845 --> 04:25.305
Some people are born
and they're actually born

04:25.306 --> 04:27.307
with these tails intact.

04:27.308 --> 04:29.810
NARRATOR:
But while conventional science

04:29.811 --> 04:32.437
appears confounded
by the possibility

04:32.438 --> 04:35.190
of mankind having
a reptilian ancestry,

04:35.191 --> 04:38.986
as far as ancient astronaut
theorists are concerned,

04:38.987 --> 04:41.947
such a profound notion
is not a mystery,

04:41.948 --> 04:44.324
but a confirmation.

04:44.325 --> 04:47.661
And they suggest
that this process is documented

04:47.662 --> 04:50.789
in the various creation stories
found in ancient cultures

04:50.790 --> 04:53.125
throughout the world.

04:53.126 --> 04:56.837
The basic tenet
of the ancient astronaut theory

04:56.838 --> 05:01.508
is manipulation artificially
of genetic material.

05:01.509 --> 05:04.177
We have a fossil record.

05:04.178 --> 05:07.848
There is no doubt in my mind
that there are hominid ancestors

05:07.849 --> 05:12.519
before <i> Homo sapiens sapiens
</i> made it.

05:12.520 --> 05:14.438
But in my opinion,

05:14.439 --> 05:16.231
the missing link
has not been found

05:16.232 --> 05:19.985
because the missing link is the
extraterrestrial intervention

05:19.986 --> 05:22.154
of our genetic makeup.

05:22.155 --> 05:24.656
HENRY:
This fits perfectly

05:24.657 --> 05:26.825
with ancient creation
mythologies.

05:26.826 --> 05:29.703
That is, that reptilian beings
came to Earth

05:29.704 --> 05:31.705
and manipulated human DNA

05:31.706 --> 05:34.125
and made us in their image.

05:35.168 --> 05:36.877
NARRATOR:
According to many

05:36.878 --> 05:38.879
ancient astronaut theorists,

05:38.880 --> 05:41.548
extraterrestrials manipulated
the genetic makeup

05:41.549 --> 05:44.384
of existing primates
on Earth to create

05:44.385 --> 05:46.721
what are considered
modern-day humans.

05:48.056 --> 05:50.140
It is this genetic manipulation

05:50.141 --> 05:54.394
that helps to explain
mankind's unique intelligence.

05:54.395 --> 05:57.522
And why humans are different
from other animals

05:57.523 --> 06:02.110
in their use of music,
language, poetry and art

06:02.111 --> 06:04.905
as a means of expressing
themselves.

06:04.906 --> 06:07.074
One of the key figures
written about

06:07.075 --> 06:09.701
on the ancient
Sumerian tablets is Enki,

06:09.702 --> 06:12.913
who they labeled the god
of smithcraft and alchemy,

06:12.914 --> 06:16.374
and also suggest as a figure who
knew the secrets of human DNA.

06:16.375 --> 06:20.212
For they credit him
with the transformation

06:20.213 --> 06:22.547
or fashioning of the human body.

06:22.548 --> 06:25.050
Very interestingly,
Enki is portrayed

06:25.051 --> 06:27.886
as a half-human,
half-serpent being.

06:27.887 --> 06:30.639
He's referred
to as a serpentine god.

06:30.640 --> 06:32.891
A reptilian being.

06:32.892 --> 06:37.062
Stories of reptilians appear
in many different cultures.

06:37.063 --> 06:41.149
In the Vedic culture, we have
the stories of the nagas.

06:41.150 --> 06:44.236
We have stories of reptilians,
of course,

06:44.237 --> 06:46.279
in the Garden of Eden.

06:46.280 --> 06:51.118
We have stories of reptilians
in the Mesoamerican cultures,

06:51.119 --> 06:54.788
like the Incas and the Mayans.

06:54.789 --> 06:57.916
Divine serpents
are unusually universal.

06:57.917 --> 07:00.168
There are examples
from Mesopotamia,

07:00.169 --> 07:03.130
from India, China, Japan,
and in the Americas,

07:03.131 --> 07:06.091
both South America
and Central America.

07:06.092 --> 07:08.468
SALLA: Different cultures
refer to reptilian beings

07:08.469 --> 07:10.428
as beings that were

07:10.429 --> 07:14.349
helping humanity acquire
technologies at a, at a point

07:14.350 --> 07:16.853
in their evolution when
we were really starting out.

07:18.938 --> 07:21.648
DOMINIC STEAVU:
In early China, the founders

07:21.649 --> 07:24.151
were considered
to have been semidivine

07:24.152 --> 07:26.319
and, in some cases,
fully divine beings.

07:26.320 --> 07:30.615
Very often they were
half-snake and half-human.

07:30.616 --> 07:35.620
HENRY: The ancient Egyptian god
Sobek is a crocodile-like deity

07:35.621 --> 07:37.497
who is credited
by the ancient Egyptians

07:37.498 --> 07:39.291
with creating the world.

07:39.292 --> 07:42.210
In portrayals at the temples
dedicated to him,

07:42.211 --> 07:45.964
he's portrayed as a human
with the head of a crocodile,

07:45.965 --> 07:48.508
who emerged from the
original waters of creation

07:48.509 --> 07:50.218
to create humanity.

07:50.219 --> 07:52.679
NARRATOR:
Is it possible

07:52.680 --> 07:55.307
that the many ancient stories
of human beings

07:55.308 --> 08:00.187
created by serpentlike gods
are inspired by actual events?

08:00.188 --> 08:03.231
Ancient astronaut theorists
say yes

08:03.232 --> 08:05.692
and point
to archaeological evidence

08:05.693 --> 08:09.197
that supports this very idea.

08:11.240 --> 08:15.869
In 1923, British archaeologist
Sir Leonard Woolley

08:15.870 --> 08:18.872
excavated one of the oldest
agricultural communities

08:18.873 --> 08:22.209
in the world,
the Sumerian city of Ur,

08:22.210 --> 08:27.255
where the ancient Sumer people
worshipped the serpent god Enki.

08:27.256 --> 08:33.220
Among the remains he discovered
some unusual clay artifacts,

08:33.221 --> 08:37.724
some dating as far back
as 4000 BC.

08:37.725 --> 08:40.894
One of the most
amazing discoveries

08:40.895 --> 08:43.020
were the figurines
that were uncovered.

08:43.022 --> 08:46.650
They were these humanoid figures

08:46.651 --> 08:50.445
with, for all intents
and purposes, heads of reptiles.

08:50.446 --> 08:52.113
They look like snake people.

08:52.114 --> 08:55.659
And you even have a motif
where this person

08:55.660 --> 08:59.704
is holding and breastfeeding
a humanoid baby.

08:59.705 --> 09:02.749
So, are they trying
to show to us

09:02.750 --> 09:05.752
that these are perhaps
the creator gods?

09:05.753 --> 09:09.422
And if you look at Enki and
some of the depictions of him,

09:09.423 --> 09:12.093
you can see him with scaly skin.

09:13.803 --> 09:17.013
All theories abound as to what
these statues represent,

09:17.014 --> 09:20.433
but, to me, they represent
possibly Sumerian gods,

09:20.434 --> 09:21.768
the Anunnaki.

09:21.769 --> 09:24.771
Enki, too, shows
these characteristics.

09:24.772 --> 09:26.273
We have to wonder if this isn't

09:26.274 --> 09:28.817
a god that wasn't visiting
just ancient Sumer,

09:28.818 --> 09:31.112
but other cultures
around the world as well.

09:33.948 --> 09:37.617
NARRATOR: Do the strange statues
unearthed in the city of Ur

09:37.618 --> 09:40.120
represent extraterrestrials
that came to Earth

09:40.121 --> 09:41.913
in the distant past?

09:41.914 --> 09:46.126
And, if so, could this provide
further evidence

09:46.127 --> 09:48.962
that extraterrestrials
used reptile DNA

09:48.963 --> 09:53.425
in their genetic manipulation
of what is now the human race?

09:53.426 --> 09:55.802
Ancient astronaut theorists
suggest

09:55.803 --> 09:58.305
that further evidence
can be found,

09:58.306 --> 10:02.267
not only by excavating ancient
sites like the city of Ur,

10:02.268 --> 10:04.769
but by looking
deep beneath the earth

10:04.770 --> 10:09.191
and at a place located
thousands of miles away.

10:17.325 --> 10:18.992
NARRATOR:
Vietnam.

10:18.993 --> 10:21.411
Phong Nha-Ke Bang National Park.

10:21.412 --> 10:25.665
Located deep within
the Southeast Asian jungles

10:25.666 --> 10:30.211
is the world's largest
cave system, the Son Doong Cave.

10:30.212 --> 10:32.714
HENRY:
It's three million years old,

10:32.715 --> 10:35.925
650 feet high, 550 feet wide,

10:35.926 --> 10:41.389
and extends in an astounding
three miles into the earth.

10:41.390 --> 10:44.392
It actually has its own
ecosystem, with a jungle

10:44.393 --> 10:47.228
and even a lake inside of it.

10:47.229 --> 10:49.522
RHODES: When the cave
was first discovered,

10:49.523 --> 10:51.941
there was a Vietnamese logger

10:51.942 --> 10:53.943
who was doing illegal logging
in the area.

10:53.944 --> 10:55.695
He discovered the cave

10:55.696 --> 10:58.740
and then encountered
some sort of a creature

10:58.741 --> 11:02.202
that looked like a dragon
humanoid being.

11:02.203 --> 11:07.332
NARRATOR: Since the site was
opened to the public in 2013,

11:07.333 --> 11:09.626
there have been multiple
eyewitness accounts

11:09.627 --> 11:14.089
of a reptilelike humanoid
in and around the area.

11:14.090 --> 11:18.468
According to UFO investigators,
the Son Doong reports

11:18.469 --> 11:21.179
are just the latest
in the increasing number

11:21.180 --> 11:25.726
of reptoid sightings in remote
areas with known cave systems.

11:26.769 --> 11:28.353
There are many stories of people

11:28.354 --> 11:32.065
encountering lizard men
or snake people

11:32.066 --> 11:36.236
who might be in caves
or who might be near a cave

11:36.237 --> 11:38.905
on the surface
just walking around.

11:38.906 --> 11:40.782
And those unfortunate enough
to stumble across

11:40.783 --> 11:42.409
these reptilians are terrified

11:42.410 --> 11:45.746
because the reptilians
can be very aggressive.

11:48.833 --> 11:51.876
NARRATOR: Is it possible
that the Son Doong Caves

11:51.877 --> 11:55.880
are home to a race of reptile
beings living beneath our feet?

11:55.881 --> 11:59.968
As far as ancient astronaut
theorists are concerned,

11:59.969 --> 12:03.346
such a bizarre notion
is entirely possible.

12:03.347 --> 12:07.434
In fact, encounters with these
creatures have become so common

12:07.435 --> 12:10.854
that the UFO community
now has a name for them:

12:10.855 --> 12:12.939
The reptilians.

12:12.940 --> 12:16.943
RHODES: Reptilian humanoids,
or reptoids, are described as being

12:16.944 --> 12:20.029
beings that are about
seven to eight feet tall,

12:20.030 --> 12:22.574
they have a humanoid structure,

12:22.575 --> 12:25.326
their skin is either beaded
like a lizard

12:25.327 --> 12:27.662
or either scaled like a snake.

12:27.663 --> 12:31.207
NARRATOR: In addition to Southeast
Asia, another location

12:31.208 --> 12:34.002
where reptilian sightings
have been reported

12:34.003 --> 12:38.339
is the area of Cuzco, Peru,
high in the Andes Mountains.

12:38.340 --> 12:41.468
According to the stories
of the Inca

12:41.469 --> 12:44.596
and the even more ancient
cultures that preceded them,

12:44.597 --> 12:48.433
a race of reptilian beings
once inhabited this land.

12:48.434 --> 12:51.978
They even built some
of the massive stone structures

12:51.979 --> 12:54.814
that still exist here today.

12:54.815 --> 12:58.943
In April 2019,

12:58.944 --> 13:01.905
ancient astronaut theorist
David Hatcher Childress

13:01.906 --> 13:05.533
and researcher Hugh Newman
traveled to Cuzco

13:05.534 --> 13:07.494
to investigate
a possible connection

13:07.495 --> 13:10.205
between the ancient stories
of reptilians

13:10.206 --> 13:11.873
and sightings of these creatures

13:11.874 --> 13:15.251
that have been reported
in the last few years.

13:15.252 --> 13:18.922
Joining them as their guide
is Jorge Luis Delgado,

13:18.923 --> 13:23.635
an expert on the native
Andean civilizations.

13:23.636 --> 13:25.678
CHILDRESS:
You know, Peru in general

13:25.679 --> 13:27.514
is just so full of mystery.

13:27.515 --> 13:31.518
To me it's really the land of
the unexplained and adventure.

13:31.519 --> 13:33.603
I never get tired
of coming here,

13:33.604 --> 13:36.689
and-and I... there's always
something new to see,

13:36.690 --> 13:39.526
- some new incredible mystery to find.
- Yeah. No, I agree.

13:39.527 --> 13:42.195
I mean, you-you've not only got
the megalithic temple,

13:42.196 --> 13:43.947
you've got Machu Picchu,

13:43.948 --> 13:46.366
Cuzco and other sites,
you've got Nazca.

13:46.367 --> 13:49.911
You've got all these mysterious
underground tunnels

13:49.912 --> 13:52.121
that stretch across the country.

13:52.122 --> 13:54.123
All these amazing myths
and legends

13:54.124 --> 13:55.959
relating to these serpent gods.

13:55.960 --> 13:58.879
So there's something really
special about this place.

14:11.225 --> 14:13.434
NARRATOR: The sprawling
fortress of Sacsayhuamán

14:13.435 --> 14:15.395
covers more
than 11 square miles,

14:15.396 --> 14:17.897
and is filled with some
of the most perplexing

14:17.898 --> 14:20.942
megalithic constructions
in the world.

14:20.943 --> 14:23.611
CHILDRESS:
They're all unique.

14:23.612 --> 14:25.196
Each one is unique

14:25.197 --> 14:27.407
but so perfectly cut
and fitted together.

14:27.408 --> 14:29.742
It's always astonishing
to see it.

14:29.743 --> 14:32.412
NARRATOR:
These ancient walls

14:32.413 --> 14:35.582
are built with unusually-shaped
stone blocks.

14:35.583 --> 14:37.667
Often weighing
thousands of pounds,

14:37.668 --> 14:39.877
they are cut so precisely,

14:39.878 --> 14:42.922
they fit together
without the need of mortar.

14:42.923 --> 14:46.342
Mainstream historians date
the megalithic fortress

14:46.343 --> 14:50.430
to the 12th century AD,
and credit its construction

14:50.431 --> 14:54.934
to a pre-Incan civilization
called the Killke.

14:54.935 --> 14:58.771
However, a growing body
of evidence suggests

14:58.772 --> 15:02.066
that the structures may actually
predate the Killke

15:02.067 --> 15:06.070
and belong
to an even older civilization.

15:06.071 --> 15:10.283
A civilization that, according
to ancient astronaut theorists,

15:10.284 --> 15:13.412
may have been
not entirely human.

15:17.625 --> 15:19.459
NEWMAN:
Oh, wow, look at this.

15:19.460 --> 15:21.336
- All right, so...
- That's the one, isn't it?

15:21.337 --> 15:23.796
Yeah. Is this the stone
you were talking about, then?

15:23.797 --> 15:26.424
Where... So, this is a serpent.

15:26.425 --> 15:28.468
This is, what, the head
of the serpent here?

15:28.469 --> 15:30.845
- DELGADO: It goes around.
- NEWMAN: And how far does it go?

15:30.846 --> 15:33.556
And can you see the tail on it?

15:33.557 --> 15:35.767
CHILDRESS: So,
you're saying that the builders

15:35.768 --> 15:40.814
are purposely putting a serpent
into the walls here.

15:49.865 --> 15:53.076
But is it the serpent people
who are building this?

15:53.077 --> 15:56.245
Are they showing that
we are the serpent people,

15:56.246 --> 15:57.665
and we are the builders?

15:59.917 --> 16:01.834
NARRATOR:
The stonework serpent

16:01.835 --> 16:03.711
is just one
of many found embedded

16:03.712 --> 16:07.340
within the constructions
of the walls around Cuzco.

16:07.341 --> 16:10.051
Might these depictions
suggest a connection

16:10.052 --> 16:13.638
at the megalithic site
with snakelike beings?

16:13.639 --> 16:17.266
Incredibly,
ancient megalithic walls

16:17.267 --> 16:20.186
that are nearly identical
to those in Peru

16:20.187 --> 16:22.730
have been discovered in nearly
every part of the globe.

16:22.731 --> 16:26.025
The ancient ruins
of Thera in Greece.

16:26.026 --> 16:28.611
The Valley Temple in Egypt.

16:28.612 --> 16:31.030
The Gympie Pyramid in Australia.

16:31.031 --> 16:34.242
Ahu Vinapu on Easter Island.

16:34.243 --> 16:37.370
Is it possible that
these massive stone walls,

16:37.371 --> 16:41.416
and others like them,
all share a common architect?

16:41.417 --> 16:43.292
All over the world,

16:43.293 --> 16:46.254
there are traditions
of the serpent people.

16:46.255 --> 16:49.132
Now, these were master
megalithic stonemasons,

16:49.133 --> 16:52.135
and I believe this is
where this high knowledge,

16:52.136 --> 16:54.178
this megalithic construction,

16:54.179 --> 16:58.599
emerged from and then spread
around the world.

16:58.600 --> 17:03.855
Throughout Peru and the Andes,
there are many, many legends

17:03.856 --> 17:07.733
of tunnels,
underground chambers.

17:07.734 --> 17:10.653
And the Peruvians
themselves believe

17:10.654 --> 17:14.406
that this underground
tunnel system

17:14.407 --> 17:17.743
has something to do
with these serpent deities,

17:17.744 --> 17:20.121
which they call the Amaru there.

17:20.122 --> 17:23.540
- So, this is the entrance.
- Wow, look at that.

17:23.541 --> 17:27.045
- Oh, wow. Look at that.
- DELGADO: Beautiful carvings.

17:44.021 --> 17:46.230
CHILDRESS: Wow,
look at these high ceilings here.

17:46.231 --> 17:47.441
NEWMAN:
Yeah.

17:50.068 --> 17:52.196
CHILDRESS: There's another shelf.
Watch your step right here.

17:57.451 --> 18:00.078
Here's another side tunnel
right there.

18:01.330 --> 18:02.955
NEWMAN:
Oh, yeah.

18:02.956 --> 18:05.750
It must be carved out as well,
isn't it?

18:05.751 --> 18:06.959
Looks like, yeah.

18:06.960 --> 18:08.961
Do you think this is
one of the tunnels,

18:08.962 --> 18:11.547
side tunnels
that might lead deeper

18:11.548 --> 18:15.052
into this underground city
of the Amarus?

18:34.738 --> 18:39.909
Sometimes people are seen coming
out of these tunnels, right?

18:39.910 --> 18:42.537
I-I mean you're saying spirits,
but also

18:42.538 --> 18:44.331
people as well, right?

18:54.508 --> 18:56.759
CHILDRESS:
Do they have a-a serpentlike

18:56.760 --> 18:58.261
appearance?

18:58.262 --> 19:00.472
Do they look,
they look like serpents?

19:11.650 --> 19:15.194
NARRATOR: Is it possible that a race
of reptilian humanoids still exists

19:15.195 --> 19:18.030
somewhere deep underground?

19:18.031 --> 19:22.118
But if so, why haven't they made
their presence known?

19:22.119 --> 19:25.663
Ancient astronaut theorists
suggest that, according

19:25.664 --> 19:29.208
to sacred texts,
the answer is clear.

19:29.209 --> 19:31.210
It is because
they were once banished

19:31.211 --> 19:34.047
from the face of the earth.

19:40.762 --> 19:42.930
NARRATOR:
Southern India.

19:42.931 --> 19:47.227
In the province of Kerala
stands the Mannarasala Temple.

19:48.312 --> 19:49.979
Within this compound

19:49.980 --> 19:54.609
are more than 30,000
stone snake idols and images.

19:54.610 --> 20:01.449
The temple is dedicated to Lord
Nagaraja, the king of the naga,

20:01.450 --> 20:03.826
who, according to local legend,

20:03.827 --> 20:06.996
still resides
at the temple today.

20:06.997 --> 20:11.876
In the Hindu tradition,
the naga are semidivine beings,

20:11.877 --> 20:14.755
half human and half cobra.

20:16.006 --> 20:17.757
STEAVU:
The nagas are often depicted

20:17.758 --> 20:21.510
as either snakes,
cobras primarily,

20:21.511 --> 20:26.349
or half human
and half reptilian beings.

20:26.350 --> 20:29.393
Usually the lower part of the
body will be that of a snake,

20:29.394 --> 20:32.730
and the upper part
will be that of a human.

20:32.731 --> 20:35.483
They're closely associated
with the subterranean

20:35.484 --> 20:37.610
underground cities

20:37.611 --> 20:41.489
that are, in many ways,
parallel worlds

20:41.490 --> 20:43.366
to the world above ground.

20:43.367 --> 20:48.913
They populate these subterranean
realms in very large numbers.

20:48.914 --> 20:51.332
NARRATOR:
According to Hindu mythology,

20:51.333 --> 20:55.920
the naga were driven underground
by the god Vishnu.

20:55.921 --> 20:59.090
Curiously, a similar story
can be found

20:59.091 --> 21:01.217
in ancient Hebrew texts.

21:01.218 --> 21:04.428
Numerous biblical
accounts suggest

21:04.429 --> 21:07.890
that although Adam and Eve are
the first humans created by God,

21:07.891 --> 21:12.937
they were not the first
to dwell upon the Earth.

21:12.938 --> 21:16.691
The Adamic race,
as recorded in the Bible,

21:16.692 --> 21:19.277
was not the first race on Earth.

21:19.278 --> 21:24.198
There were pre-Adamic
civilizations.

21:24.199 --> 21:27.076
The pre-Adamic civilizations

21:27.077 --> 21:29.662
has a history
which we do not know.

21:29.663 --> 21:34.250
NARRATOR: A race that walked
the Earth before Adam and Eve?

21:34.251 --> 21:36.419
Might this be
the reptilian-like beings

21:36.420 --> 21:38.587
mentioned in ancient texts?

21:38.588 --> 21:42.383
Ancient astronaut theorists
suggest

21:42.384 --> 21:44.301
that the serpent
in the Garden of Eden

21:44.302 --> 21:47.096
may be the key
to solving the mystery.

21:47.097 --> 21:49.515
There have always been talk

21:49.516 --> 21:52.768
about a reptilian race,

21:52.769 --> 21:55.646
whether it's angelic
or extraterrestrial.

21:55.647 --> 22:00.151
Most people will look towards
the example in Genesis

22:00.152 --> 22:01.944
with the serpent.

22:01.945 --> 22:06.574
Ancient legend tells us that the
serpent in the Garden of Eden

22:06.575 --> 22:10.661
was actually a humanoid form.

22:10.662 --> 22:12.538
It stood erect,
had arms, it had legs,

22:12.539 --> 22:16.959
and clearly it spoke,
as we know from biblical record.

22:16.960 --> 22:19.086
NARRATOR: According to
the Book of Genesis,

22:19.087 --> 22:22.298
this reptilian figure's
interference with mankind

22:22.299 --> 22:24.717
leads to him being punished
by God.

22:24.718 --> 22:26.761
TZADOK:
Genesis, chapter one, verse two

22:26.762 --> 22:29.055
states
that the world was in chaos.

22:29.056 --> 22:31.974
It indicates to us,
very possibly,

22:31.975 --> 22:37.688
a pre-Adamic war
amongst civilizations.

22:37.689 --> 22:41.025
We find echoes of this
in literature,

22:41.026 --> 22:43.277
both in our Judaic traditions,

22:43.278 --> 22:46.614
as well as in literature
from around the world.

22:46.615 --> 22:49.200
I don't think we should be
so quick to dismiss these things

22:49.201 --> 22:52.495
in light of archaeological
discoveries.

22:52.496 --> 22:55.039
In the story of the serpent
being punished,

22:55.040 --> 22:56.624
we seem to have
literary evidence

22:56.625 --> 22:59.586
of an extraterrestrial battle
or war going on.

23:01.213 --> 23:03.631
NARRATOR:
An extraterrestrial battle?

23:03.632 --> 23:06.008
Ancient astronaut theorists
suggest

23:06.009 --> 23:08.677
that not only
did such a war occur,

23:08.678 --> 23:13.182
but physical evidence of this
can be found across the globe.

23:13.183 --> 23:16.852
In Cuzco, Peru,
local Andean expert

23:16.853 --> 23:19.021
and guide Jorge Delgado

23:19.022 --> 23:21.273
is taking David Childress
and Hugh Newman

23:21.274 --> 23:25.153
to one of the most curious sites
in the city.

23:26.863 --> 23:28.073
Wow.

23:38.083 --> 23:39.834
NEWMAN:
That is incredible.

23:39.835 --> 23:42.962
Yeah.

23:42.963 --> 23:44.505
NARRATOR:
Inexplicably,

23:44.506 --> 23:46.715
this megalithic stone appears
to have been toppled over

23:46.716 --> 23:49.426
180 degrees.

23:49.427 --> 23:54.432
Legend says it was displaced
during a great cataclysm.

23:59.813 --> 24:01.188
NEWMAN:
It's incredible.

24:01.189 --> 24:04.191
CHILDRESS:
Hugh, have you seen evidence

24:04.192 --> 24:06.735
of cataclysms like this
in some of your journeys?

24:06.736 --> 24:09.322
Well, I mean,
at Tiahuanaco and Puma Punku.

24:10.699 --> 24:14.660
It looks like a tidal wave
has hit the site from the lake.

24:14.661 --> 24:18.414
We have the vitrified forts
in Scotland for instance,

24:18.415 --> 24:21.835
which show extreme heating,
like some kind of solar flare.

24:24.796 --> 24:26.505
CHILDRESS:
And the Hittite cities in, uh,

24:26.506 --> 24:28.174
- Turkey and stuff like that.
- NEWMAN: Yeah.

24:28.175 --> 24:30.759
CHILDRESS: Places where
it looks like some missile

24:30.760 --> 24:34.889
or some giant explosion
has just blown up

24:34.890 --> 24:37.766
these megalithic towers
and walls.

24:37.767 --> 24:40.769
NARRATOR:
Missiles?

24:40.770 --> 24:43.230
Gigantic explosions?

24:43.231 --> 24:46.609
Might this be physical evidence
of a devastating war

24:46.610 --> 24:50.112
fought between groups
of extraterrestrials?

24:50.113 --> 24:54.700
Stories of ancient battles
between supernatural beings

24:54.701 --> 24:59.538
can be found in sacred texts
throughout the world.

24:59.539 --> 25:02.750
In Greek mythology,
there are destructive battles

25:02.751 --> 25:04.627
between Zeus and Typhon,

25:04.628 --> 25:09.089
a monster described as having
coiled serpent legs.

25:09.090 --> 25:12.343
The ancient Egyptians had tales
of unending battles

25:12.344 --> 25:15.095
between the sun god Ra and Apep,

25:15.096 --> 25:19.683
the serpent deity
of the underworld.

25:19.684 --> 25:22.811
Curiously,
in each of these accounts,

25:22.812 --> 25:26.857
the losing party is represented
by a serpent or dragon.

25:26.858 --> 25:30.569
HENRY: In the stories of the
battles between the gods,

25:30.570 --> 25:34.448
we learn of a battle
between extraterrestrial forces,

25:34.449 --> 25:36.367
some described as reptilians.

25:36.368 --> 25:38.619
What happened to those
reptilian beings?

25:38.620 --> 25:42.498
Well, they're banished
to the interior of the Earth.

25:42.499 --> 25:45.459
You're saying there's
extraterrestrial races,

25:45.460 --> 25:49.922
and this stone is evidence
of this extraterrestrial war

25:49.923 --> 25:52.759
and some cataclysms
that were happening.

25:56.096 --> 25:57.304
Okay, it's upside down,

25:57.305 --> 26:00.058
- the war, this cataclysm.
- DELGADO: Exactly.

26:09.276 --> 26:13.320
NARRATOR: If an ancient extraterrestrial
war took place on Earth,

26:13.321 --> 26:15.614
what was it fought over?

26:15.615 --> 26:19.159
Some ancient astronaut theorists
suggest the participants

26:19.160 --> 26:22.538
may have had conflicting agendas
for humanity,

26:22.539 --> 26:24.540
and that the ultimate outcome

26:24.541 --> 26:27.794
has not yet been determined.

26:34.676 --> 26:36.677
NARRATOR:
Scottsdale, Arizona.

26:36.678 --> 26:40.389
February 2018.

26:40.390 --> 26:43.142
Thousands descend on this small

26:43.143 --> 26:46.145
desert community to attend
the 27th annual

26:46.146 --> 26:48.814
International UFO Congress.

26:48.815 --> 26:52.484
The event offers UFO researchers
an opportunity

26:52.485 --> 26:55.154
to not only share the latest
developments in the field,

26:55.155 --> 26:57.948
but also to hear from people
who believe

26:57.949 --> 27:01.160
they have come into contact
with extraterrestrials.

27:01.161 --> 27:04.371
Over the course
of the five-day event,

27:04.372 --> 27:08.250
attendees describe encounters
with alien beings

27:08.251 --> 27:11.545
that take a variety
of physical forms.

27:11.546 --> 27:14.506
There seem to be
three categories

27:14.507 --> 27:16.342
of organic alien beings

27:16.343 --> 27:17.926
that have been interacting
with humanity.

27:17.927 --> 27:20.721
You have your reptilian types,

27:20.722 --> 27:23.182
you have what we describe
as the Nordics,

27:23.183 --> 27:24.892
and then you have the Greys.

27:24.893 --> 27:27.853
These types of descriptions
appear over and over again

27:27.854 --> 27:30.564
in various mythic
and historical traditions.

27:30.565 --> 27:32.983
NARRATOR: Do the accounts
of modern-day encounters

27:32.984 --> 27:35.861
with extraterrestrials
support the notion

27:35.862 --> 27:39.656
that the reptilians are just one
of numerous alien races

27:39.657 --> 27:42.117
that have been influencing
events on Earth,

27:42.118 --> 27:45.037
dating back thousands of years?

27:45.038 --> 27:50.542
And if so, do they each have
their own agenda for humankind?

27:50.543 --> 27:53.379
Clearly what we are
being told here is that,

27:53.380 --> 27:56.924
in the ancient times, there was
a battle for control over Earth

27:56.925 --> 28:00.220
and indeed the destiny
of humanity.

28:02.347 --> 28:06.016
CHILDRESS: Ancient astronaut
theorists often think that there were

28:06.017 --> 28:07.726
several kinds
of extraterrestrials

28:07.727 --> 28:09.187
who were coming to the planet...

28:10.522 --> 28:14.858
and fighting wars
over which extraterrestrial race

28:14.859 --> 28:17.945
would nurture humans
and bring them along

28:17.946 --> 28:20.114
to the point where they are now.

28:20.115 --> 28:23.492
MARTELL: The idea that there's
been warring factions of E.T.s

28:23.493 --> 28:26.161
trying to have control
over the human race

28:26.162 --> 28:29.415
or the world in general
goes way into the past.

28:29.416 --> 28:32.167
We have to wonder
if they weren't all

28:32.168 --> 28:34.753
doing genetic experimentation.

28:34.754 --> 28:38.757
NARRATOR: If human DNA was
manipulated by extraterrestrials,

28:38.758 --> 28:41.510
as ancient astronaut
theorists suggest,

28:41.511 --> 28:45.889
might this have been done
by various alien races?

28:45.890 --> 28:49.476
CHILDRESS: A number of abductees
have claimed that they've been

28:49.477 --> 28:52.604
subjected to genetic experiments

28:52.605 --> 28:55.149
by reptilian aliens who are

28:55.150 --> 28:59.695
looking at them and their DNA
for ongoing research

28:59.696 --> 29:02.782
of creating, s-say,
a future human.

29:04.033 --> 29:06.452
It seems reasonable
to assume that,

29:06.453 --> 29:09.621
if we human beings are now
experimenting with animals,

29:09.622 --> 29:11.248
doing genetic experiments,

29:11.249 --> 29:13.292
that if we have
a higher culture to us,

29:13.293 --> 29:15.294
scientifically,
an older culture,

29:15.295 --> 29:16.962
they may have been drawing us in

29:16.963 --> 29:19.840
as their experimental,
uh, stock.

29:19.841 --> 29:23.927
Could Earth have been actually
populated a long time ago

29:23.928 --> 29:25.971
as an actual zoo?

29:25.972 --> 29:29.892
In other words, could we have
other alien beings always

29:29.893 --> 29:33.228
coming down to Earth because
Earth is their science workshop?

29:33.229 --> 29:37.858
NARRATOR: As far as ancient
astronaut theorists are concerned,

29:37.859 --> 29:40.486
a growing body
of evidence suggests,

29:40.487 --> 29:43.530
not only that multiple races
of extraterrestrials

29:43.531 --> 29:45.449
have a presence on the Earth,

29:45.450 --> 29:51.205
but that there may be government
officials who are aware of them.

29:51.206 --> 29:53.373
LINDA MOULTON HOWE:
In December 1999,

29:53.374 --> 29:56.668
a man was retiring from
the Defense Intelligence Agency

29:56.669 --> 29:58.045
and told me his job

29:58.046 --> 30:01.423
for 23 years was to monitor

30:01.424 --> 30:04.343
and analyze competing

30:04.344 --> 30:07.137
extraterrestrial
territorial conflicts

30:07.138 --> 30:10.224
on planet Earth.
The D.I.A. guy said,

30:10.225 --> 30:12.559
"Our government has proof that

30:12.560 --> 30:16.021
"three competing
extraterrestrial civilizations

30:16.022 --> 30:19.691
"have been mixing and matching
genes on this planet,

30:19.692 --> 30:22.236
"using this as a laboratory

30:22.237 --> 30:26.406
for at least 270 million years."

30:26.407 --> 30:30.702
The human race is not
a pure human species.

30:30.703 --> 30:32.746
It is part reptilian,

30:32.747 --> 30:36.750
it is part other
extraterrestrial.

30:36.751 --> 30:41.255
I believe it started
with a group of the reptilian

30:41.256 --> 30:44.633
type beings that began
this experiment

30:44.634 --> 30:47.344
with DNA manipulation.

30:47.345 --> 30:49.054
At that time, other groups

30:49.055 --> 30:52.266
of nonhuman
extraterrestrial beings

30:52.267 --> 30:55.727
wanted to also participate
in this experiment.

30:55.728 --> 30:59.731
With time,
those different factions

30:59.732 --> 31:02.734
started to not see eye to eye.

31:02.735 --> 31:06.822
That is the reason why
we hear about stories

31:06.823 --> 31:09.742
where there's wars in the sky.

31:12.287 --> 31:13.495
There are those that believe

31:13.496 --> 31:15.747
that the reptilian beings
were banished

31:15.748 --> 31:17.749
to an interior part
of the Earth,

31:17.750 --> 31:19.167
and that perhaps
they're awaiting

31:19.168 --> 31:21.962
a time such as today
for them to, once again,

31:21.963 --> 31:25.383
arise to take control
of humanity.

31:28.261 --> 31:31.763
NARRATOR: If reptilian
extraterrestrials were responsible

31:31.764 --> 31:34.141
for the creation
of the first humans

31:34.142 --> 31:36.518
and were later forced
to retreat beneath the earth

31:36.519 --> 31:38.186
by other alien races,

31:38.187 --> 31:41.398
will they continue
to remain in hiding?

31:41.399 --> 31:45.527
Or, based on the growing number
of recent sightings,

31:45.528 --> 31:49.656
are they preparing to reemerge?

31:49.657 --> 31:53.243
Perhaps further clues
can be found by examining

31:53.244 --> 31:55.287
a secret underground
Air Force base

31:55.288 --> 31:58.123
where some
have reported encounters...

31:58.124 --> 32:00.293
with reptilians.

32:08.468 --> 32:11.137
NARRATOR:
Dulce, New Mexico.

32:12.805 --> 32:15.849
This unassuming town
has been home

32:15.850 --> 32:17.643
to the Jicarilla Apache
Indian tribe

32:17.644 --> 32:19.312
for over six centuries.

32:21.147 --> 32:24.441
Jicarilla Apache folklore
is filled with stories

32:24.442 --> 32:26.401
of interactions
with star people,

32:26.402 --> 32:29.363
including lizard and ant men
they describe

32:29.364 --> 32:31.407
as living underground.

32:33.326 --> 32:38.246
To them, those star people
are as active and interactive

32:38.247 --> 32:41.667
with the planet now
as they ever have been.

32:41.668 --> 32:46.838
It was Western civilization
that ran by and buried

32:46.839 --> 32:49.341
the whole issue
of extraterrestrials

32:49.342 --> 32:54.179
and reptiles as mythological.

32:54.180 --> 32:56.890
But it is the Jicarilla Apaches
in Dulce

32:56.891 --> 32:59.518
who will also tell you
that they know

32:59.519 --> 33:03.522
that there are some type
of beings that are underground

33:03.523 --> 33:06.525
in Dulce, and that the keys

33:06.526 --> 33:09.528
are Mount Archuleta

33:09.529 --> 33:11.530
and Archuleta Mesa.

33:11.531 --> 33:13.532
And below those two,

33:13.533 --> 33:17.869
there are deep underground bases

33:17.870 --> 33:21.581
that have been operated
by some form

33:21.582 --> 33:26.713
of reptilian-related being
for centuries.

33:29.382 --> 33:31.425
NARRATOR: According to
government insiders,

33:31.426 --> 33:34.386
located nearly two miles
beneath the surface

33:34.387 --> 33:37.806
is indeed a secret subterranean
military base

33:37.807 --> 33:41.560
known as the
Dulce Air Force Base.

33:41.561 --> 33:45.230
The base is rumored to extend
seven levels underground,

33:45.231 --> 33:50.319
with the lowest levels occupied
by extraterrestrial species.

33:51.988 --> 33:54.906
Whistle-blower Phil Schneider
claimed to have worked

33:54.907 --> 33:56.783
on the construction
of these deep, underground

33:56.784 --> 34:00.912
military bases
for the U.S. government.

34:00.913 --> 34:04.082
Phil Schneider was
a very interesting geologist

34:04.083 --> 34:08.879
used by the U.S. government
to do excavations of large areas

34:08.880 --> 34:11.590
under military contract,
where they were essentially

34:11.591 --> 34:13.759
going to be building
large caverns

34:13.760 --> 34:16.762
and connecting
underground passageways.

34:16.763 --> 34:21.475
NARRATOR: On May 8, 1995,
Schneider gave a presentation

34:21.476 --> 34:25.103
in Post Falls, Idaho
and claimed he was attacked

34:25.103 --> 34:27.982
by extraterrestrials
deep underground.

34:48.002 --> 34:51.922
NARRATOR: According to Phil,
at the time of his encounter,

34:51.922 --> 34:55.175
his team had been contracted
to create an addition

34:55.176 --> 34:57.344
to the existing Dulce
underground base.

34:57.345 --> 34:59.763
They were drilling holes deep
into the ground

34:59.764 --> 35:03.683
and using explosives
to create caverns...

35:03.684 --> 35:08.105
when they encountered numerous
Grey and reptilian aliens.

35:25.998 --> 35:28.625
NARRATOR: Phil Schneider
later described learning about

35:28.626 --> 35:32.879
genetic experiments conducted by
the same extraterrestrial beings

35:32.880 --> 35:35.466
he encountered
at Dulce Air Force Base.

35:39.053 --> 35:42.055
But sadly, he would never
get the chance

35:42.056 --> 35:44.225
to provide further information.

35:46.352 --> 35:50.188
Just eight months after his
presentation in Post Falls,

35:50.189 --> 35:54.317
Philip Schneider was found dead
in his apartment

35:54.318 --> 35:56.820
with rubber tubing
wrapped around his neck.

35:56.821 --> 35:59.906
- (siren wailing) - Those who
knew him best were shocked

35:59.907 --> 36:03.535
when his death was ruled
a suicide, and many insisted

36:03.536 --> 36:07.206
this was a cover story...
for an assassination.

36:08.541 --> 36:10.876
Part of what I'm going
to tell you

36:10.877 --> 36:12.627
is going to be very shocking.

36:12.628 --> 36:15.380
SALLA: If people had learned
of what Phil Schneider

36:15.381 --> 36:17.883
was revealing,
they would have understood

36:17.884 --> 36:19.801
that there had been
agreements reached

36:19.802 --> 36:22.888
between the U.S. government

36:22.889 --> 36:26.308
and some of these
extraterrestrial civilizations.

36:26.309 --> 36:28.268
And that there were
many individuals

36:28.269 --> 36:30.562
that were abducted
and being subjected

36:30.563 --> 36:33.732
to all kinds
of human experimentation

36:33.733 --> 36:35.693
at the Dulce base.

36:38.446 --> 36:40.238
NARRATOR: Did Phil
Schneider encounter the same

36:40.239 --> 36:42.324
reptilian extraterrestrials

36:42.325 --> 36:44.910
that the Inca credited
with creating underground cities

36:44.911 --> 36:49.040
in the Southern Highlands
of Peru hundreds of years ago?

36:50.625 --> 36:54.044
Some ancient astronaut theorists
suggest that not only

36:54.045 --> 36:57.756
are extraterrestrials
working with the government...

36:57.757 --> 37:01.968
they have infiltrated society
at the highest levels.

37:01.969 --> 37:05.680
MARTELL: One of the other
theories in the field of ufology

37:05.681 --> 37:09.935
is that the reptilian presence
is actually active today,

37:09.936 --> 37:11.811
and that they've
concealed themselves

37:11.812 --> 37:13.813
by taking more of a human form,

37:13.814 --> 37:16.191
but have infiltrated
many world governments

37:16.192 --> 37:17.943
or top world positions.

37:17.944 --> 37:20.820
We have to wonder if there isn't
some type of an agenda,

37:20.821 --> 37:23.448
once again, taking place where

37:23.449 --> 37:26.201
they're letting
their presence be known.

37:26.202 --> 37:29.329
NARRATOR: Might the stories of
reptilians hiding amongst us

37:29.330 --> 37:33.500
be true?
And if so, to what end?

37:33.501 --> 37:37.170
Some believe that not only are
they trying to influence

37:37.171 --> 37:39.839
the course of humanity,
they are creating

37:39.840 --> 37:43.719
a superior species
of human-alien hybrids.

37:53.145 --> 37:56.147
NARRATOR:
Hove, England. 2008.

37:56.148 --> 37:58.149
In the middle of the night,

37:58.150 --> 38:00.902
20-year-old
Charmaine D'Rozario-Saytch

38:00.903 --> 38:04.114
is sleeping in bed
when she awakens

38:04.115 --> 38:05.490
to a frightening sight...

38:05.491 --> 38:09.078
a reptilian humanoid
staring down at her.

38:11.330 --> 38:13.707
D'ROZARIO-SAYTCH:
I woke up.

38:13.708 --> 38:16.501
A reptilian came into the room.

38:16.502 --> 38:19.422
We went to an underground cave.

38:20.506 --> 38:23.341
There was a group
of reptilians there,

38:23.342 --> 38:25.845
and they stood round me
in a circle.

38:27.054 --> 38:29.723
Each one of them put one hand
on my body.

38:29.724 --> 38:33.184
And I slowly changed.

38:33.185 --> 38:35.270
And it was the most amazing

38:35.271 --> 38:39.858
but also sort of
bizarre situation

38:39.859 --> 38:42.027
to, to look down at your body

38:42.028 --> 38:45.739
and see it morph
from your human form

38:45.740 --> 38:47.699
into a reptilian form.

38:47.700 --> 38:52.203
To see the skin shift
from being smooth into scales.

38:52.204 --> 38:54.205
And to find that I had a tail.

38:54.206 --> 38:58.710
NARRATOR: Could Charmaine's
incredible story be true?

38:58.711 --> 39:03.256
Was she really transformed
into a reptilian-human hybrid?

39:03.257 --> 39:06.217
Charmaine claims she learned
from her abductors

39:06.218 --> 39:09.304
that all humans today
are byproducts

39:09.305 --> 39:13.851
of alien genetic manipulation...
some more than others.

39:16.270 --> 39:19.314
D'ROZARIO-SAYTCH: At certain
points in our history,

39:19.315 --> 39:21.775
different E.T. races
have come to this planet,

39:21.776 --> 39:25.904
and they have not manipulated
<i>all</i> of humanity,

39:25.905 --> 39:27.238
but certain groups.

39:27.239 --> 39:32.452
HOWE: The reason an agenda
for alien intelligences

39:32.453 --> 39:34.245
to be on this planet,

39:34.246 --> 39:37.374
manipulating humans and animals,

39:37.375 --> 39:38.750
is because...

39:38.751 --> 39:42.253
there are wars out there

39:42.254 --> 39:46.049
between different types
of intelligences

39:46.050 --> 39:48.010
about territory.

39:49.220 --> 39:53.348
And that those territorial wars
involve

39:53.349 --> 39:58.104
populations
of created and manipulated life.

39:59.897 --> 40:03.149
NARRATOR: If reptilian
extraterrestrials have inhabited Earth

40:03.150 --> 40:04.776
for thousands of years,

40:04.777 --> 40:08.822
are they content to continue
hiding out underground?

40:08.823 --> 40:11.282
Or is the day fast approaching

40:11.283 --> 40:13.451
where they will step out
of the shadows

40:13.452 --> 40:15.788
and announce their presence
once again?

40:18.916 --> 40:22.252
TSOUKALOS: The Christians are
waiting for the return of Jesus.

40:22.253 --> 40:25.130
The Jews are waiting
for the return of the Messiah.

40:25.131 --> 40:27.465
The Islamic community is waiting

40:27.466 --> 40:28.758
for the return of Muhammad.

40:28.759 --> 40:32.804
The idea of this return
did not originate

40:32.805 --> 40:35.807
with any of those
religious figures,

40:35.808 --> 40:38.643
but it, in fact, originated

40:38.644 --> 40:42.313
with the promise
by extraterrestrials

40:42.314 --> 40:44.608
that they would return
in the future.

40:45.985 --> 40:49.654
Tradition tells us that the army
of the Messiah

40:49.655 --> 40:52.407
is not to come from heaven,

40:52.408 --> 40:55.326
but is to arise
from inner Earth,

40:55.327 --> 40:59.665
and therefore dominate
the surface world.

41:01.750 --> 41:05.503
CHILDRESS: Perhaps we are now
at this special turning point

41:05.504 --> 41:09.674
in, in our history
and the timeline of planet Earth

41:09.675 --> 41:14.179
where the reptilians
and the other extraterrestrials

41:14.180 --> 41:16.848
will announce themselves.

41:16.849 --> 41:20.935
NARRATOR: Could evidence of
secret underground cities,

41:20.936 --> 41:24.397
combined with recent accounts
of encounters

41:24.398 --> 41:28.026
with so-called reptilian
creatures, be preparing us

41:28.027 --> 41:30.778
to accept a profoundly different
genetic truth

41:30.779 --> 41:32.864
than the one
we have been taught?

41:32.865 --> 41:37.202
That mankind didn't only evolve
from a race of primates,

41:37.203 --> 41:40.288
but also from a race
of reptiles...

41:40.289 --> 41:42.749
whose genes were spliced
into our own

41:42.750 --> 41:46.669
by means of extraterrestrial
manipulation?

41:46.670 --> 41:49.547
If true, such a revelation

41:49.548 --> 41:52.717
would revolutionize everything
we have come to believe

41:52.718 --> 41:55.428
about our existence
on this planet.

41:55.429 --> 41:58.723
But it may also lead
to a profound understanding

41:58.724 --> 42:01.601
not only about mankind's past

42:01.602 --> 42:04.813
but about its future.
