04:52.759 --> 04:53.919
It's a Western dog, Master!

04:54.861 --> 04:56.158
It has spots, so it is evil

08:08.521 --> 08:09.112
Good footwork.

08:09.355 --> 08:11.289
13th Aunt, the train is rocking so much

08:11.724 --> 08:12.554
how will we eat?

08:12.992 --> 08:14.459
You're not used to it.

08:14.727 --> 08:16.524
Look, the foreigners are coping fine.

08:16.762 --> 08:17.729
Come and sit here.

08:18.197 --> 08:19.061
Now it's much better

08:19.265 --> 08:21.699
this journey used to take all day.

08:24.403 --> 08:25.927
The trees look like they're flying.

08:27.206 --> 08:28.230
Whoops...

08:28.541 --> 08:29.872
I feel ill.

08:30.109 --> 08:32.907
What's wrong, Foon? So much talk!

08:33.246 --> 08:33.735
Nothing...

08:36.982 --> 08:38.109
My stomach is churning.

08:39.251 --> 08:40.378
You're train sick!

08:40.620 --> 08:42.587
Don't eat or you'll throw up.

08:44.457 --> 08:48.257
But I must! There's Western food to eat

08:48.394 --> 08:49.088
right, Master?

08:50.296 --> 08:52.628
We haven't ordered yet.

08:53.733 --> 08:56.201
You don't need to order
your food on the train.

08:56.903 --> 08:57.597
Miss, the soup.

08:57.937 --> 08:58.369
Thank you.

08:58.804 --> 08:59.964
It's all been prepared.

09:01.007 --> 09:02.099
You mean it's not fresh?

09:05.444 --> 09:06.069
Solar eclipse?

09:06.479 --> 09:08.572
Don't be so scared. idiot!

09:09.982 --> 09:11.882
13th Aunt, what's going on?

09:12.351 --> 09:13.682
We're in a tunnel.

09:13.886 --> 09:14.853
A tunnel?

09:15.521 --> 09:18.251
The train is strong enough

09:18.558 --> 09:20.116
to go through a mountain?

09:22.895 --> 09:23.793
Amazing!

09:24.797 --> 09:25.525
Idiot!

09:26.332 --> 09:29.392
Foon, we're all together now, but

09:29.635 --> 09:32.570
don't run off when we get to town.

09:32.805 --> 09:33.464
OK.

09:33.639 --> 09:37.075
There will be a lot of foreigners
at the medical convention.

09:38.210 --> 09:38.904
Don't embarrass us.

09:39.245 --> 09:40.143
I understand. Master.

09:47.119 --> 09:48.108
So many hands!

09:55.027 --> 09:56.961
Fei hung, eat the soup while it's hot.

10:00.533 --> 10:02.797
Foon, eat the soup while it's hot.

10:04.337 --> 10:06.771
Master. I don't know which hand is mine.

10:17.316 --> 10:18.340
I can do it that way.

10:22.655 --> 10:23.587
Have you finished your soup, sir?

10:23.889 --> 10:26.221
I'll finish it later.

10:28.561 --> 10:30.586
Only meat? Where's the rice?

10:31.964 --> 10:33.090
Miss, have you finished your soup?

10:34.033 --> 10:34.624
I don't want it.

10:38.537 --> 10:39.026
Thank you.

10:41.073 --> 10:43.667
Fei hung, it's a steak,
use your knife and fork.

10:44.377 --> 10:45.275
I've seen this before.

10:48.247 --> 10:48.975
You're always doing this.

10:50.216 --> 10:52.548
What a waste! Don't throw it away.

10:52.752 --> 10:53.411
Sorry, Master.

10:54.253 --> 10:55.481
Concentrate on what you are doing.

10:59.558 --> 11:00.320
Watch me.

11:02.561 --> 11:03.653
Are you OK?

11:03.829 --> 11:04.318
I'll clean your face.

11:04.497 --> 11:06.431
Yes, I'm fine. Here's your steak.

11:07.366 --> 11:09.834
Master, don't throw it away!

11:09.969 --> 11:11.766
It's all your fault.

11:12.071 --> 11:13.231
Forget it, let's eat.

11:24.016 --> 11:25.415
Why are you so quiet?

11:27.987 --> 11:30.615
No reason. Why are you so quiet?

11:31.190 --> 11:34.159
Oh, no, I can't hold it any more!

11:34.326 --> 11:35.224
Foon!

11:35.695 --> 11:36.218
I'm sorry.

11:36.996 --> 11:39.021
I told you not to eat.

11:39.865 --> 11:41.594
Hold on, we'll be in Canton soon.

11:42.068 --> 11:42.625
Really?

11:43.402 --> 11:44.027
Yes.

11:44.437 --> 11:46.769
Riding in a train is quite a challenge.

11:47.907 --> 11:48.999
Waiter, can you pack this?

11:49.241 --> 11:49.730
What did you say?

11:50.142 --> 11:51.131
I just don't want to waste it.

11:54.080 --> 11:56.014
Chicken buns!

11:57.083 --> 11:58.448
Give me a pot of tea.

11:59.318 --> 12:01.013
Old man, you owe me money. Pay up!

12:01.187 --> 12:02.984
If I can't play, I can't pay.

12:04.023 --> 12:06.719
Look, a crowd.
What's on the banners?

12:06.959 --> 12:12.989
Support the scholar's proposal!

12:13.165 --> 12:15.690
We object to the cession of Taiwan!

12:16.001 --> 12:17.901
Where is Taiwan?

12:18.237 --> 12:20.569
We lost the war and gave it to Japan.

12:21.307 --> 12:23.502
Taiwan must be near the sea...

12:23.943 --> 12:26.935
or it wouldn't be called Tai island.

12:27.279 --> 12:29.042
I don't even know how big it is.

12:29.515 --> 12:31.745
We can't even manage Canton, forget it.

12:31.984 --> 12:34.646
Let's drink.

12:34.820 --> 12:35.787
Eat, we'll talk later.

12:36.055 --> 12:40.492
We object to Li Hung chang's
concession to Japan!

12:40.726 --> 12:44.958
We object to the cession of Taiwan!

12:45.831 --> 12:47.628
Look at the clothes on that woman!

12:47.800 --> 12:48.459
Where?

12:48.701 --> 12:50.532
Over there. The one in the rickshaw.

12:50.803 --> 12:52.930
Come and have a look.

12:53.105 --> 12:53.696
She's wearing Western clothes.

12:54.707 --> 12:56.174
Those are Western clothes?

12:56.375 --> 12:58.366
They're so ugly!

12:58.544 --> 12:59.135
Sister?

13:01.981 --> 13:03.539
We object to the cession of Taiwan!

13:03.783 --> 13:04.613
Let's do the lottery.

13:04.817 --> 13:05.545
Nine is my lucky number.

13:05.751 --> 13:06.581
I don't know how to play.

13:07.153 --> 13:09.621
Support the scholar's proposal!

13:09.822 --> 13:13.223
We object to the cession of Taiwan!

13:13.425 --> 13:18.294
We object to Li Hung chang's
concession to Japan!

13:18.430 --> 13:21.888
We object to the cession of Taiwan!

13:22.067 --> 13:26.902
Support the scholar's proposal!

13:27.072 --> 13:27.697
Money first, look after your tickets.

13:27.873 --> 13:28.737
Get your ticket and move on.

13:28.908 --> 13:30.102
The next draw will be at dinner time!

13:30.810 --> 13:31.504
The lottery!

13:33.913 --> 13:35.346
Roast pork buns!

13:37.116 --> 13:40.051
We're here, sir.
Ten cents, please.

13:40.219 --> 13:40.651
Thank you.

13:40.986 --> 13:44.319
Let's eat. Pulling this rickshaw
will be the death of me.

13:47.159 --> 13:48.820
That's a pretty dress.

13:48.994 --> 13:49.926
Can I take a picture?

13:50.329 --> 13:51.261
You're not a foreigner. Get her!

13:51.463 --> 13:52.430
Get her! Get her!

13:52.898 --> 13:54.866
Go away, you pesky kids!

13:55.034 --> 13:58.197
Throwing things at people!

14:01.207 --> 14:02.037
No manners!

14:02.241 --> 14:03.902
Foon!
Get lost...

14:04.443 --> 14:05.273
Don't hit the children.

14:05.945 --> 14:07.708
I'm bleeding!

14:07.913 --> 14:08.277
Sister?

14:08.514 --> 14:10.778
Look, you've made trouble again.

14:11.417 --> 14:11.906
Master...

14:14.386 --> 14:16.081
Let's go, we'll tell Uncle Gao.

14:16.956 --> 14:19.652
Those kids are so naughty,
throwing things at people.

14:19.825 --> 14:21.087
Look at the mess.

14:21.260 --> 14:23.626
Attention, please.

14:23.796 --> 14:25.195
White Lotus are meeting
at Telegraph House.

14:25.364 --> 14:26.353
We should all go.

14:26.665 --> 14:33.901
Don't leave! Don't forget to pay!

14:34.106 --> 14:35.505
Master Wong, I'm going to have a look.

14:35.674 --> 14:38.575
13th Aunt... 13th Aunt!

14:38.744 --> 14:41.042
Foon! Foon!

14:42.514 --> 14:43.674
Hurry! They're about to start!

14:43.849 --> 14:46.010
Come on, hurry up!

14:51.924 --> 14:54.586
I n the name of the people's army
stand down!

14:54.894 --> 14:57.522
Damned soldiers, working for foreigners!

14:57.897 --> 15:00.764
Stone them!

15:02.735 --> 15:03.531
Get out of the way.

15:05.104 --> 15:06.867
Move!

15:08.307 --> 15:11.538
Wind and fire come together...
Kill all foreigners.

15:11.844 --> 15:15.712

Eradicate all evil!

15:18.717 --> 15:23.313
Burn down Telegraph House!

15:24.256 --> 15:26.053
Excuse me, please.

15:26.258 --> 15:27.589
Aunt, let's take the photo here.

15:27.960 --> 15:29.052
Help me set up the tripod.

15:29.361 --> 15:30.350
Over there.

15:31.897 --> 15:34.661
Wind and fire come together...

15:35.067 --> 15:36.659
It's starting now.

15:37.336 --> 15:39.702
I can't see. I can't take pictures.

15:39.838 --> 15:40.566
Get on my shoulders.

15:40.906 --> 15:41.395
Get on your shoulders?

15:43.842 --> 15:46.811
OK, keep still.

15:47.913 --> 15:52.714
White Lotus is divine!
Power to the people!

15:52.952 --> 15:55.147
White Lotus is divine!
Power to the people!

15:55.454 --> 15:57.945
Kill all foreigners
so we can live in peace!

15:58.290 --> 16:00.451
White Lotus is divine!
Power to the people!

16:00.693 --> 16:02.456
Foon, this position is no good.

16:03.495 --> 16:04.462
So good.

16:05.731 --> 16:10.361
Wind and fire come together.
Kill all foreigners.

16:10.502 --> 16:13.801
White Lotus has come to save you
by driving evil away!

16:14.206 --> 16:17.403
What was that?

16:22.915 --> 16:23.574
Thank you.

16:25.584 --> 16:27.552
She can make lightning, run away!

16:29.655 --> 16:31.350
Arrest that evil spirit!

16:33.125 --> 16:35.093
The top one or the bottom one?

16:35.394 --> 16:36.588
The foreigner on top.

16:37.096 --> 16:37.687
Arrest her!

16:41.000 --> 16:41.864
Calm down!

16:42.634 --> 16:44.795
She is Chinese.
she's not a foreigner!

16:44.970 --> 16:45.732
Have a look.

16:46.271 --> 16:48.000
Look at the way you dress.

16:48.207 --> 16:49.367
It proves you're evil. Arrest her!

16:52.111 --> 16:53.442
13th Aunt, run! I'll protect you!

16:55.948 --> 16:57.176
My camera!

17:01.420 --> 17:01.943
13th Aunt!

17:04.556 --> 17:06.751
13th Aunt! Where are you, 13th Aunt?

17:07.659 --> 17:11.425
Foon! Help me, Foon!

17:11.563 --> 17:13.394
Kill all foreigners
so we can live in peace!

17:14.032 --> 17:15.694
Take her to the temple,
burn her to death!

17:16.568 --> 17:17.592
Put her down!

17:24.276 --> 17:24.674
Fei hung!

17:25.611 --> 17:26.305
Who the hell are you

17:26.678 --> 17:28.839
to stop me?

17:29.915 --> 17:30.677
Tell me your name!

17:31.583 --> 17:32.880
I'm Wong Fei hung from Fushan.

17:33.752 --> 17:34.411
Fei hung?!

17:35.220 --> 17:36.118
And Leung Foon too!

17:36.622 --> 17:37.919
I hear his kung fu is deadly.

17:38.090 --> 17:39.250
Kick you

18:01.947 --> 18:04.211
kick you... to death!

18:04.383 --> 18:06.544
Leave him alone, pick on someone else.
You'll hurt him.

18:08.220 --> 18:09.244
Who else? Where?

18:09.421 --> 18:10.547
Hit them, don't hurt them.

18:15.027 --> 18:15.516
That's enough.

18:17.429 --> 18:18.054
Ten finger punch!

18:19.698 --> 18:21.723
Thank you, thank you.

18:22.301 --> 18:23.097
Master.

18:25.771 --> 18:27.033
Are you all right, 13th Aunt?

18:27.272 --> 18:29.172
you came just in time.

18:32.511 --> 18:33.705
What is it? It smells sweet.

18:36.748 --> 18:37.271
It's sleeping powder.

18:37.950 --> 18:38.814
Foon! Take care of 13th Aunt.
Master

18:39.084 --> 18:39.607
Take care of 13th Aunt.

18:40.519 --> 18:41.952
13th Aunt...!

18:45.657 --> 18:46.646
Mystical power...

18:54.633 --> 18:56.601
All this trickery and mumbo jumbo and

18:57.069 --> 18:58.229
you claim to be acting in God's name!

18:59.204 --> 19:01.138
13th Aunt, wake up! 13th Aunt!

19:01.607 --> 19:02.869
13th Aunt! Help her up.

19:07.880 --> 19:09.507
Foon, take 13th Aunt back to the inn.

19:17.256 --> 19:18.450
Foon, what are you waiting for?

19:21.460 --> 19:24.122
He's one of Canton's Ten Tigers.
His kung fu is legendary.

19:25.230 --> 19:25.958
Get back!

19:29.234 --> 19:31.031
What is he taking?

19:31.069 --> 19:34.038
Master Wong, don't! That thing is evil!

19:35.574 --> 19:36.700
Stand back!

19:40.913 --> 19:42.471
Master Wong, can I be your apprentice?

19:42.681 --> 19:43.613
Back! Don't follow me!

20:00.365 --> 20:01.161
Fei hung!

20:02.000 --> 20:02.591
You're awake.

20:05.137 --> 20:07.002
They covered you in sleeping powder.

20:07.773 --> 20:09.434
Did you carry me back here?

20:09.942 --> 20:12.069
No. Foon did.

20:12.844 --> 20:14.368
Why did he carry me back?

20:15.914 --> 20:17.404
Foon is preparing your medicine.

20:18.183 --> 20:20.151
Take it and rest for two days
and you'll be fine.

20:27.593 --> 20:28.059
Master Wong.

20:28.493 --> 20:28.925
Come in.

20:30.262 --> 20:30.921
Don't go out alone

20:31.063 --> 20:32.394
this town is in turmoil.

20:33.999 --> 20:35.261
Rest a while, don't worry.

20:36.435 --> 20:37.925
Fei hung, I'm all right.

20:38.237 --> 20:41.331
I can still be your interpreter
at the convention tomorrow.

20:42.441 --> 20:43.703
Let's talk about that later.

20:44.676 --> 20:45.700
Take your medicine now.

20:49.348 --> 20:51.248
Master Wong, sorry to disturb you.
It's OK.

20:53.585 --> 20:55.280
Oh, you're awake.

20:55.487 --> 20:58.149
Did you know...
You carried me back.

20:58.323 --> 20:59.051
Yes. I did.

21:01.360 --> 21:03.294
The medicine is very hot, be careful.

21:09.735 --> 21:11.862
Mr Mak, what can I do for you?

21:12.104 --> 21:14.504
I sent my servant to buy these clothes.

21:14.973 --> 21:17.407
Please ask her to wear them.

21:17.676 --> 21:18.802
That's very kind of you.

21:19.077 --> 21:21.545
Don't mention it. Mystical kung fu
is very popular now.

21:21.747 --> 21:23.738
Foreigners make them mad.

21:24.283 --> 21:26.717
Master Wong, I've known you
for a long time

21:26.918 --> 21:27.976
I'll be frank with you.

21:28.453 --> 21:29.818
If Miss wears her own clothes

21:30.055 --> 21:32.250
she'll definitely get into trouble.

21:33.625 --> 21:34.216
I understand.

21:35.093 --> 21:36.117
How much were they?

21:36.295 --> 21:37.319
There'll be no charge.

21:37.496 --> 21:38.053
Thank you.

21:39.498 --> 21:41.261
Thanks for your help, Master Wong.

21:44.202 --> 21:47.035
Here you can see the 5 main regions
of the brain.

21:47.539 --> 21:50.940
According to the result of
a medical study and research

21:51.176 --> 21:56.614
we understand the function and the nervous
system of a human body are controlled by the brain...

21:57.115 --> 22:00.050
If I knew it would be so boring
I'd have asked So to come.

22:00.585 --> 22:03.816
which believes those function comes from
the heart

22:04.389 --> 22:07.620
This is a theory I of course
cannot subscribe to

22:08.593 --> 22:11.585
and thus I'm afraid to conclude
my lecture

22:12.064 --> 22:13.929
Thank you for your attention.

22:21.973 --> 22:27.138
And now I'd like to introduce Dr. Wong Fei Hung,
from Fu Shan Region of Canton

22:30.649 --> 22:31.638
There's another one!

22:34.519 --> 22:37.682
It's not any of them.
Another foreigner.

22:39.157 --> 22:40.351
Dr. Wong, it's your turn.

22:40.826 --> 22:41.815
Foon, it's our turn.

22:42.227 --> 22:43.660
I'll let you out.
We'll go together.

22:43.829 --> 22:44.420
Please don't, master

22:45.230 --> 22:46.322
Thank you. Thank you.

22:51.737 --> 22:54.900
My topic of discussion
for today is Chinese acupuncture.

22:55.207 --> 22:58.438
I beg your pardon, Dr. Wong.
I don't quite understand.

22:59.244 --> 23:00.973
Louder.

23:01.246 --> 23:02.213
There are 360 pressure points...

23:02.414 --> 23:05.042
Dr. Wong, what do the lines represent?

23:05.217 --> 23:05.979
Do you want him to speak louder?

23:07.085 --> 23:07.949
That's not what he means.

23:08.520 --> 23:10.681
Dr. Wong, may I interpret for you?

23:15.327 --> 23:18.228
Gentlemen, allow me
to translate for Dr. Wong.

23:20.098 --> 23:21.497
Very good!

23:24.503 --> 23:25.595
May I know your name?

23:26.071 --> 23:28.562
My name is Sun Yat sen.

23:28.707 --> 23:31.835
Dr. Sun, I'm most grateful to you.

23:32.043 --> 23:33.032
Don't mention it.
Thank you.

23:34.179 --> 23:37.307
The five elements are gold, wood,
water, fire and earth.

23:37.516 --> 23:38.346
They form a network.

23:38.617 --> 23:39.948
Acupuncture regulates the nervous system.

23:42.554 --> 23:49.858
The human body consists of 5 major organs.
Heart, liver, spleen, lungs & kidneys.

23:50.395 --> 23:53.091
These organs are all connected by nerves

23:53.432 --> 23:57.493
and acupuncture can regulate
the human nervous system.

23:58.503 --> 24:01.404
Dr. Wong, I'm not quite sure
what your chart exactly means.

24:01.606 --> 24:04.541
But in western medical studies.
we call it the nervous system.

24:05.243 --> 24:08.007
Allow me to give you
a demonstration of what I mean.

24:22.127 --> 24:23.594
Reflex action.

24:24.362 --> 24:26.353
Dr. Wong, Dr. Thompson

24:26.531 --> 24:28.931
doesn't quite understand.

24:29.701 --> 24:32.829
His demonstration shows the Western
understanding of the nervous system.

24:34.039 --> 24:34.869
That's quite simple.

24:35.240 --> 24:38.141
I can use needles to close two nerves

24:38.376 --> 24:39.468
so that he can't move his leg.

24:44.483 --> 24:46.178
Master, are you going to stick
those in me?

25:00.632 --> 25:01.223
Dr. Sun, ask them

25:01.566 --> 25:03.124
to test his reflexes now.

25:06.505 --> 25:07.529
Please try again.

25:21.953 --> 25:23.614
Really amazing!

25:32.898 --> 25:34.889
White Lotus is divine!
Power to the people!

25:35.166 --> 25:37.532
Foreigners out, leave us in peace!

25:49.881 --> 25:51.314
Master!

25:55.554 --> 25:57.419
The White Lotus sect again!

26:01.293 --> 26:03.784
Master! I can't move!

26:04.396 --> 26:05.294
I'll be shot!

26:06.231 --> 26:07.061
I'm a goner!

26:09.401 --> 26:11.369
Master, I've only been stabbed
by you, not them.

26:20.045 --> 26:21.444
Mr. Sun, your bag.

26:21.880 --> 26:22.539
Leave it.

26:29.788 --> 26:31.983
We're finished here.
Back to the Temple!

26:32.557 --> 26:34.115
Are you OK?
I'm fine.

26:34.326 --> 26:36.123
Mr. Sun, here's your bag.

26:37.162 --> 26:39.494
If we get the opportunity

26:39.798 --> 26:41.390
let's exchange ideas, shall we?

26:41.967 --> 26:43.992
China needs more men like you.

26:44.302 --> 26:45.428
You flatter me.

26:45.937 --> 26:46.528
See you soon.

26:48.907 --> 26:51.068
The White Lotus Sect is
always making trouble.

26:52.010 --> 26:54.535
Master. 13th Aunt must be
still at the inn.

26:55.313 --> 26:56.541
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

27:04.189 --> 27:04.848
The White Lotus Sect?

27:05.924 --> 27:06.686
Come out!

27:10.195 --> 27:10.718
Fei hung!

27:14.933 --> 27:15.661
Master, what's the matter?

27:16.801 --> 27:17.597
Nothing, come on, out.

27:18.570 --> 27:20.561
Master, you look pale

27:20.739 --> 27:21.535
something must have happened.

27:22.007 --> 27:22.939
It's just a woman changing.

27:24.542 --> 27:25.167
Mind your own business!

27:25.777 --> 27:27.108
But you saw it.

27:32.651 --> 27:50.024
Don't ask me about the past.

27:50.235 --> 27:54.467
I'm so sad and lonely.

27:55.073 --> 28:04.971
My future looks bleak and poor.

28:05.316 --> 28:14.918
Tears flow when I think of the past.

28:15.126 --> 28:24.091
I always wanted to be a soldier.

28:24.536 --> 28:34.502
But I was raised in Confucianism.

28:34.646 --> 28:43.748
So I lost my dream...

28:43.922 --> 28:52.626
And missed my destiny.

28:52.764 --> 29:01.297
I lost my idealism.

29:01.439 --> 29:09.437
The winter wind blows...

29:09.581 --> 29:17.147
Even the wild geese don't stop.

29:17.322 --> 29:24.251
For I have no message
for them to take home.

29:24.462 --> 29:31.630
My tears show the reflection of dawn.

29:31.803 --> 29:38.538
We are hopelessly in love.

29:38.710 --> 29:46.014
Worlds apart, the sky is near.

29:46.217 --> 29:53.817
I'll spend the rest of my days alone.

29:53.925 --> 30:15.235
Wandering from place to place till I die.

30:15.413 --> 30:16.744
What a terrible noise!

30:17.182 --> 30:18.342
Tell him to stop.

30:18.550 --> 30:19.482
Here!

30:20.752 --> 30:24.244
Thank you, thank you...

30:26.624 --> 30:27.056
Sir.

30:27.992 --> 30:29.823
Telegraph House is our only contact
with the outside world.

30:30.395 --> 30:32.488
Protect it.

30:32.697 --> 30:33.061
Yes, sir.

30:34.599 --> 30:35.031
Sir.

30:46.678 --> 30:47.975
There are a lot of bystanders

30:48.179 --> 30:49.373
take care not to hit them.

30:49.881 --> 30:51.815
Drive the White Lotus towards the gate.

30:52.050 --> 30:52.744
Yes, sir.

30:54.819 --> 30:56.286
Sir, if this continues

30:56.754 --> 30:58.984
we will be outnumbered.

31:00.491 --> 31:04.052
Burn down Telegraph House.

31:05.396 --> 31:07.626
Master...

31:09.934 --> 31:10.662
Dinner time!

31:12.237 --> 31:14.671
I got a nice treat
to help 13th Aunt get well.

31:17.141 --> 31:17.937
It is delicious.

31:18.209 --> 31:19.938
Yes, it is.

31:20.144 --> 31:20.940
What is it?

31:22.680 --> 31:24.841
Foon, haven't you told 13th Aunt
what this is?

31:25.617 --> 31:26.845
Don't you know?

31:34.392 --> 31:36.326
13th Aunt, do you like dogs?

31:37.829 --> 31:40.491
They're man's best friend.
I like them more than cats, anyway.

31:41.966 --> 31:42.591
What's the matter?

31:43.935 --> 31:46.403
Nothing. Let's eat.

31:48.306 --> 31:49.671
People like dogs in different ways.

31:54.479 --> 31:55.241
They went that way.

31:55.446 --> 31:56.105
Let's go over there and take a look.

31:59.984 --> 32:01.246
Canton is in chaos.

32:01.953 --> 32:03.648
Foon, pack our things after dinner.

32:04.055 --> 32:05.283
We'll go to the station early tomorrow.

32:06.157 --> 32:07.749
Take 13th Aunt back to Fushan.

32:08.359 --> 32:08.950
OK.

32:09.694 --> 32:10.683
You'd better eat well tonight

32:11.029 --> 32:15.159
you don't want to be sick on the train.

32:18.569 --> 32:21.094
Come outside when you've finished
the dog meat

32:21.306 --> 32:22.170
I'd like a word.

32:22.740 --> 32:24.173
You'd like a word with me?

32:26.344 --> 32:28.676
What did you say? This is dog meat?

32:30.014 --> 32:31.072
Is it really?

32:31.983 --> 32:32.574
Yes.

32:33.518 --> 32:35.349
Yes, Master loves dogs.

32:51.469 --> 32:54.495
13th Aunt, I want to teach you kung fu.

32:55.239 --> 32:56.831
Me? Why?

32:57.108 --> 32:57.802
These are troubled times.

32:59.811 --> 33:02.609
You could use it for self defence.

33:03.214 --> 33:04.841
The basic technique has 36 stances.

33:05.149 --> 33:06.980
The advanced has 72 stances.

33:07.285 --> 33:09.253
There are 108 pressure points...

33:09.454 --> 33:10.148
Fei hung!

33:11.522 --> 33:13.387
Do I need to remember all this?

33:13.791 --> 33:15.850
No, just listen
and try to get the basics.

33:17.328 --> 33:19.660
Remember, for punches,
attack from the side.

33:20.898 --> 33:22.365
For kicks, come from below.

33:25.336 --> 33:27.065
What if someone has a knife?

33:27.772 --> 33:29.205
I'll teach you that another time.

33:30.475 --> 33:36.072
Look, this is the single,
this is the double.

33:36.881 --> 33:39.008
Such effort! Why don't I use a gun?

33:39.183 --> 33:40.115
Shut up!

33:45.957 --> 33:46.981
I was a bit rude.

33:47.725 --> 33:49.556
That's how I speak to my students.

33:51.562 --> 33:53.792
I'm fine, let's continue.

33:54.766 --> 33:55.926
OK.

33:56.901 --> 33:57.492
The first move.

33:59.404 --> 34:00.200
Go for my head.

34:03.708 --> 34:04.504
Pay attention.

34:05.343 --> 34:07.004
Grab the hand, crouch down, then twist.

34:07.578 --> 34:09.512
Grab the hand, crouch down...

34:09.679 --> 34:10.271
then twist.

34:10.782 --> 34:11.714
then twist.

34:11.916 --> 34:12.405
Let's try again.

34:13.751 --> 34:16.583
Grab the hand, crouch down, then twist.

34:16.920 --> 34:18.478
The second move, throat lock.

34:19.190 --> 34:21.487
Come on, attack my throat, harder.

34:21.859 --> 34:23.292
Grab the hand, crouch down, elbow up.

35:07.171 --> 35:07.796
13th Aunt?

35:10.675 --> 35:11.437
Be careful!

35:13.444 --> 35:14.103
Why aren't you concentrating?

35:14.879 --> 35:17.609
I was practising in my head.

35:20.151 --> 35:21.118
Try it once more.

35:21.586 --> 35:23.019
The first move, grab the head.

35:24.255 --> 35:25.153
What's next?

35:29.594 --> 35:29.992
Then punch!

35:33.097 --> 35:33.563
Are you OK?

35:33.998 --> 35:35.488
I'm OK, it's better to be your friend

35:35.700 --> 35:37.292
than your enemy.

35:39.170 --> 35:41.161
Sir, we've received a telegram
from Hong Kong.

35:41.405 --> 35:42.895
We've no time for that now.

35:46.511 --> 35:49.036
It says someone's planning
a rebellion here.

35:51.182 --> 35:51.910
Here's the message.

35:59.557 --> 36:02.185
Sir, it's another telegram
from Hong Kong.

36:03.961 --> 36:07.419
This is serious.
guard Telegraph House well.

36:09.100 --> 36:10.328
I'll inform the Governor.

36:10.535 --> 36:11.058
Yes, sir.

36:47.772 --> 36:49.763
This way please!

36:55.479 --> 36:56.639
Please go inside.

36:57.248 --> 36:58.044
Your Excellency.

36:58.416 --> 37:00.213
The British consul invited me here

37:00.418 --> 37:01.385
can't this wait?

37:01.686 --> 37:04.154
Our spies in Hong Kong

37:04.422 --> 37:06.185
cabled us twice today.

37:06.657 --> 37:09.217
The Chiu Chow Society are planning

37:09.393 --> 37:10.883
to smuggle weapons to Canton.

37:11.128 --> 37:11.856
They want to start a revolution.

37:13.364 --> 37:13.955
a revolution?

37:14.298 --> 37:15.128
Is it the White Lotus Sect?

37:15.600 --> 37:16.123
No.

37:18.970 --> 37:20.062
Their leader is called Sun Yat sen.

37:22.773 --> 37:23.831
Sun Yat sen?

37:25.076 --> 37:26.668
Officer, who is this Sun Yat sen?

37:27.645 --> 37:28.441
Your Excellency

37:28.879 --> 37:30.574
He's the one who started

37:30.781 --> 37:32.305
the Agricultural Society.

37:32.783 --> 37:35.149
He's a doctor.
he's always giving speeches

37:36.320 --> 37:38.151
and criticising the Government.

37:38.422 --> 37:40.356
He encourages democracy too.

37:40.591 --> 37:42.650
He says China should be a republic.

37:42.793 --> 37:44.090
How can a doctor rebel?

37:44.362 --> 37:45.920
Do we not have enough men?

37:46.397 --> 37:48.490
White Lotus has been
causing trouble recently

37:48.799 --> 37:50.027
so we're under manned.

37:50.868 --> 37:52.836
The Government is having trouble

37:53.070 --> 37:54.765
with the French in the north.

37:55.172 --> 37:56.571
I think there'll be war soon.

37:56.841 --> 37:59.105
It won't be easy to get reinforcements.

38:03.614 --> 38:05.377
The British are our allies

38:05.650 --> 38:07.379
they'll help keep the other
foreigners at bay.

38:16.761 --> 38:19.252
Put the army and navy on alert

38:19.664 --> 38:22.064
and extra men at ports and stations
till we find Sun Yat sen.

38:23.834 --> 38:24.801
What was That society?

38:25.169 --> 38:26.568
the Agricultural Society.

38:28.005 --> 38:30.098
Who else is involved with Sun Yat sen?

38:30.508 --> 38:32.601
Someone called Luke Ho dung
is the money man.

38:36.681 --> 38:39.741
Sir, should we bring him in
for questioning?

38:40.184 --> 38:42.812
Yes, let's bring him in.

38:42.987 --> 38:43.612
Yes, sir.

38:49.126 --> 38:49.558
Sir?

38:49.960 --> 38:50.449
I'm not going.

38:52.530 --> 38:54.395
A busy night tonight.

38:55.533 --> 38:56.227
Yes.

38:59.070 --> 38:59.695
Sir.

39:14.952 --> 39:16.783
Chow, tell Snake to get up

39:17.054 --> 39:18.851
it's not his day off!

39:20.424 --> 39:23.416
Did you spend all night
at the brothel? Get up!

39:23.627 --> 39:24.252
Hurry!

39:24.628 --> 39:25.526
Be careful. 13th Aunt.

39:26.097 --> 39:26.756
Take it easy.

39:27.898 --> 39:28.865
Foon, what are you doing?

39:29.600 --> 39:31.261
She twisted her ankle.

39:32.103 --> 39:34.571
How come? I only showed you

39:34.839 --> 39:36.067
hand movements. What happened?

39:38.476 --> 39:40.967
I don't know.
It was just hurting when I got up.

39:42.246 --> 39:44.942
Foon insisted on carrying me
when he found out.

39:45.950 --> 39:46.712
Foon!

39:46.884 --> 39:48.181
I don't mind. Master.

39:48.953 --> 39:51.615
Well, let me carry her,
you take the luggage.

39:55.092 --> 39:55.990
It hurts.

40:04.769 --> 40:06.293
I always do the carrying.

40:06.537 --> 40:09.062
Now you want to get involved.

40:12.543 --> 40:13.066
Waiter!

40:16.547 --> 40:17.172
May I help you?

40:17.982 --> 40:18.812
We'd like to check out.

40:21.852 --> 40:22.841
Boss.

40:24.021 --> 40:26.512
Master Wong?
We are leaving now.

40:26.824 --> 40:28.257
Oh, thank God!

40:28.993 --> 40:31.223
No, no, I mean have a safe journey.

40:31.462 --> 40:32.759
Sorry for the trouble.

40:32.997 --> 40:33.656
If you're ever...

40:33.898 --> 40:34.592
Fei hung, look.

40:34.999 --> 40:35.829
What's going on?

40:36.600 --> 40:37.931
He is badly hurt.

40:38.235 --> 40:38.667
Hey, what's going on?

40:38.869 --> 40:41.303
The White Lotus have burned down
Friendship Hall.

40:41.539 --> 40:42.335
Take him to see the doctor.

40:42.573 --> 40:44.063
What's Friendship Hall?

40:44.341 --> 40:45.433
It's where they teach foreign languages.

40:46.076 --> 40:47.509
It's full of students.

40:48.345 --> 40:49.607
Mr. Mak, where's the school?

40:49.980 --> 40:51.379
Near the fruit market.

40:51.682 --> 40:52.876
Don't go there!

40:53.050 --> 40:53.846
13th Aunt!

40:54.018 --> 40:55.144
Master, where's she going?

40:55.319 --> 40:56.081
Foon, you lied to me

40:56.287 --> 40:57.117
she's OK.

40:57.721 --> 40:59.621
It was her idea. Master.

40:59.924 --> 41:01.016
Wait for me.

41:03.994 --> 41:04.790
Friendship Hall. Is this it?

41:14.104 --> 41:15.264
Master! Wait for me!

41:32.756 --> 41:33.245
What is it?

41:33.624 --> 41:34.522
Skin.

41:35.693 --> 41:36.591
It's human skin.

41:55.346 --> 41:55.778
Master.

41:56.547 --> 41:57.377
It's the younger students.

41:58.649 --> 41:59.741
It's lucky they were hiding.

42:05.489 --> 42:06.012
What's happening?

42:06.323 --> 42:08.621
Let's go and have a look.

42:10.060 --> 42:11.391
What's going on in there?

42:11.896 --> 42:14.194
They've gone now.
Don't worry. Be good.

42:14.565 --> 42:16.863
I'm scared.

42:17.701 --> 42:19.464
They stormed in and kicked us.

42:19.670 --> 42:21.501
Master Wong! Why are you still here?

42:21.939 --> 42:23.600
Are these children with you?

42:23.807 --> 42:25.104
They are students
from the Friendship Hall.

42:25.342 --> 42:26.741
We just needed a rest.

42:26.944 --> 42:27.933
They can't stay here!

42:28.178 --> 42:29.372
If White Lotus comes

42:29.580 --> 42:30.979
I'm finished!

42:31.615 --> 42:32.843
I don't know them, even worse

42:33.150 --> 42:34.139
they study foreign languages.

42:34.618 --> 42:36.711
Take them to the courthouse.

42:37.154 --> 42:38.849
Can't we rest for a moment?

42:39.089 --> 42:40.579
I don't know how to fight.

42:40.758 --> 42:41.383
This inn is all I have.

42:41.559 --> 42:43.049
I have to support my family.

42:43.227 --> 42:44.353
If it's burnt down. I'll...

42:44.495 --> 42:45.894
I'll help!

42:46.363 --> 42:47.295
Mr. Mak!

42:47.731 --> 42:49.892
He's fainted...

42:50.067 --> 42:50.829
Have you got some salts?

42:51.936 --> 42:54.666
You've made him faint.
Who do you think you are?

42:54.905 --> 42:57.999
If he dies, I'll call the police.

42:58.142 --> 42:58.870
Then I'll back off.

42:59.510 --> 43:01.478
Foon, 13th Aunt, let's go.

43:02.279 --> 43:04.076
Let's send them home.

43:06.183 --> 43:07.548
Where do you live?

43:07.785 --> 43:08.979
I'm from Kwangsi Province.

43:09.286 --> 43:10.150
I'm also from Kwangsi.

43:10.588 --> 43:11.885
I'm from Fukien Province.

43:12.523 --> 43:14.115
He's from Chuijao

43:15.225 --> 43:17.193
they're from Kwangsi.

43:17.895 --> 43:20.329
I guess the rest
are not from here, either.

43:21.265 --> 43:22.789
Do any of you live here?

43:24.001 --> 43:26.367
Miss, I live by the north gate,
so does he.

43:27.871 --> 43:28.963
I live in Sha Min.

43:29.273 --> 43:32.765
I think I live near the east gate.

43:34.445 --> 43:35.969
Anybody else?

43:36.447 --> 43:39.439
I came here on the train.
I've no idea where did I come from.

43:39.717 --> 43:41.412
I stay at school all the time.

43:42.653 --> 43:44.780
We'll take these two home.
The rest come with us.

43:45.956 --> 43:47.287
I'll carry you.

43:47.424 --> 43:50.188
Foon! Order some chicken rice

43:50.394 --> 43:51.122
for our journey.

43:52.396 --> 43:54.091
Waiter, 20 portions of chicken rice!

43:54.365 --> 43:56.265
Come on, you too.

44:11.315 --> 44:14.079
Sir... what can I do for you?

44:14.284 --> 44:16.912
I'd like to know if the children from

44:17.121 --> 44:18.645
Friendship Hall came here earlier?

44:20.557 --> 44:22.991
Students? No, no, you've come
to the wrong place.

44:23.193 --> 44:23.955
Boss

44:28.198 --> 44:29.893
Have any of you seen the students?

44:30.134 --> 44:32.534
There are no students here, you fool!

44:32.836 --> 44:34.701
Maybe the boogie man's got them.

44:35.973 --> 44:44.108
The King rules heaven
The devil rules hell...

44:44.248 --> 44:45.909
It's lucky
the students are gone.

44:46.216 --> 44:55.557
Between the two there is White Lotus
Keeping our country safe

44:55.759 --> 44:56.726
Lucky tokens!

44:56.927 --> 44:58.224
I want one.

44:59.263 --> 45:01.959
The hanging lantern will keep you safe.

45:02.266 --> 45:04.461
Lucky tokens will protect your family!

45:04.835 --> 45:07.133
Light the lanterns.
Here's the offering.

45:07.638 --> 45:11.904
Lucky tokens will protect your family!

45:12.209 --> 45:15.406
This will keep you safe.

45:15.946 --> 45:17.641
of course, of course.

45:18.115 --> 45:20.675
Give more offerings
to ensure your safety.

45:43.440 --> 45:46.068
Finish up in there. We have to leave.

45:49.179 --> 45:49.941
Be quiet.

45:50.114 --> 45:51.979
What happened to your hands?

45:52.950 --> 45:54.781
It's not my blood, it's his.
It's everywhere.

45:58.856 --> 46:01.848
Will he die? He's badly injured.
We can't stay here.

46:02.593 --> 46:03.560
I'll go to the courthouse to see

46:03.794 --> 46:04.920
if they'll take them.

46:05.229 --> 46:06.491
Stay here.

46:09.433 --> 46:09.865
Foon!

46:10.567 --> 46:11.465
Help me bandage the poor kid.

46:12.603 --> 46:13.501
I haven't finished yet.

46:15.973 --> 46:17.497
Don't be naughty. Come back here.

46:17.708 --> 46:20.074
I just wanted to know
where he was going.

46:21.278 --> 46:22.677
Foon, you stink.

46:25.682 --> 46:26.671
You peed on me!

46:26.917 --> 46:28.441
I told you I wasn't done yet.

47:52.903 --> 47:54.268
Sir, Wong Fei hung
would like to see you.

48:18.829 --> 48:19.318
Sir!

49:06.009 --> 49:06.566
Sir.

49:23.327 --> 49:25.352
Master Wong, now I see why
you're so famous.

49:25.729 --> 49:26.627
Thank you. Thank you.

49:26.830 --> 49:27.524
It was nothing, sir.

49:28.432 --> 49:30.764
I just wanted to spar with you a little.

49:31.168 --> 49:33.796
Master Wong, your Shaolin staff
is excellent.

49:34.071 --> 49:37.234
Maybe you can teach me some other time.

49:37.874 --> 49:38.306
Have some wine.

49:39.609 --> 49:40.268
Thank you.

49:45.248 --> 49:47.307
His Shaolin staff isn't that good.

49:47.784 --> 49:49.411
He hit that pole,
but it didn't even move.

49:50.020 --> 49:51.419
People say he is the master of kung fu

49:51.588 --> 49:53.112
I don't think it is true.

49:58.495 --> 50:01.931
All our troops are busy
protecting foreigners.

50:02.366 --> 50:04.300
It may not be that safe here either.

50:04.968 --> 50:06.196
If the students come here

50:06.636 --> 50:09.002
the White Lotus will come
to cause trouble.

50:09.239 --> 50:09.762
Sir.

50:09.973 --> 50:13.067
I know it's my job to protect the people.

50:13.944 --> 50:14.968
The trouble is even though I can fight

50:15.645 --> 50:18.773
I don't have the men to support me.

50:20.617 --> 50:22.084
I'm deeply ashamed.

50:32.829 --> 50:33.295
Foon!

50:34.264 --> 50:34.855
come over here.

50:35.265 --> 50:35.890
Stay out of the way.

50:38.268 --> 50:39.826
Stay out of the way.

50:40.003 --> 50:40.628
He is still bleeding.

50:41.738 --> 50:43.797
Master isn't back yet.
What shall we do?

50:44.307 --> 50:44.932
He's not moving.

50:45.308 --> 50:46.605
Why isn't he moving?

50:50.680 --> 50:51.476
It's Mozart.

50:51.882 --> 50:53.372
What do you mean?

50:53.550 --> 50:56.144
Listen. Can't you hear
the foreign music?

50:57.421 --> 50:58.786
There must be a foreign consulate nearby.

50:59.423 --> 51:00.048
A consulate?

51:06.596 --> 51:13.832
Beware of fire!
Beware of thieves!

51:14.204 --> 51:16.172
13th Aunt. Foon!

51:17.574 --> 51:18.666
I need to pee.

51:19.109 --> 51:20.201
Wait until you're home.

51:20.444 --> 51:22.139
It's bad for my kidneys.

51:22.379 --> 51:24.108
So? They're rotten anyway.

51:24.247 --> 51:24.941
Don't move!

51:25.515 --> 51:26.482
Stay there!

51:30.821 --> 51:33.619
Where has the sect taken
the woman and children?

51:34.324 --> 51:36.087
We aren't with White Lotus.

51:36.560 --> 51:38.050
My children are in bed now.

51:38.261 --> 51:39.250
My woman has run off...

51:39.463 --> 51:40.555
What?
Master.

51:41.498 --> 51:42.760
Foon, where did you go?

51:45.035 --> 51:47.196
13th Aunt took the children
to a safe place.

51:47.938 --> 51:48.404
Really?

51:50.440 --> 51:51.372
Why are you holding

51:51.842 --> 51:53.104
a White Lotus lantern?

51:53.577 --> 51:55.602
To bring us good luck.

51:55.879 --> 51:58.211
But it doesn't seem to have worked.
May I go now?

51:58.415 --> 52:00.849
Yes!

52:01.151 --> 52:02.243
Come on, hurry.

52:04.154 --> 52:05.485
Foon, let's go.

52:06.590 --> 52:07.887
Don't you remember me?

52:08.125 --> 52:09.888
I came with the children...

52:10.360 --> 52:13.295
and a beautiful lady.

52:13.563 --> 52:15.463
I only left to find my master.

52:15.799 --> 52:16.493
I don't understand you.

52:16.700 --> 52:18.065
Go away!

52:18.201 --> 52:19.168
Nonsense!

52:20.403 --> 52:22.803
Foon, did 13th Aunt bring
the children here?

52:23.039 --> 52:25.473
Yes, he let us in before.
but now he won't.

52:26.610 --> 52:32.310
13th Aunt... I've come with Master!
13th Aunt...

52:32.516 --> 52:35.007
Shut up!

52:35.519 --> 52:36.713
Did he ask us to stand up straight?

52:37.220 --> 52:37.948
That's what I heard.

52:39.189 --> 52:39.678
13th Aunt?

52:39.890 --> 52:43.018
13th Aunt.
we are waiting at the entrance.

52:43.360 --> 52:44.622
Open the gate, go away.

52:45.095 --> 52:46.062
13th Aunt...

52:46.730 --> 52:47.754
Master, they're opening the gate.

52:48.832 --> 52:49.389
Go away now!

52:49.699 --> 52:51.030
How dare you!

52:51.201 --> 52:52.862
Foon, stay calm.

52:53.103 --> 52:54.263
Hands up! Surrender now.

52:54.437 --> 52:56.132
Don't hit me!

52:56.373 --> 52:57.237
Tell them why we're here.

52:57.407 --> 52:59.102
I have!
Put your guns down.

52:59.342 --> 53:00.934
They don't understand.

53:01.378 --> 53:02.072
Stop!

53:02.245 --> 53:02.870
Stop pointing that at me!

53:03.046 --> 53:04.172
Stop!

53:04.514 --> 53:05.913
Wait!

53:06.850 --> 53:08.477
Allow me to clear up the confusion.

53:10.020 --> 53:10.782
Alright.

53:12.556 --> 53:14.547
Pardon me. My name is
Luke Ho dung, and yours?

53:15.292 --> 53:16.224
I'm Wong Fei hung from Fushan.

53:17.994 --> 53:18.824
Wong Fei hung?

53:19.196 --> 53:20.493
You saved the children!

53:20.730 --> 53:22.129
Yes, they're all inside

53:22.499 --> 53:23.796
but the soldiers won't let us in.

53:24.568 --> 53:24.932
It's only a mistake.

53:25.202 --> 53:26.260
What are you looking?
Stand back.

53:26.503 --> 53:27.561
This Jesus is agony.

54:26.363 --> 54:26.954
Luke.

54:29.399 --> 54:32.891
Why do foreigners believe in a god
whose face has so much suffering?

54:36.873 --> 54:38.773
Everyone has a god in their heart.

54:39.376 --> 54:40.866
When we're young
we believe in one god

54:40.910 --> 54:42.434
when we're older
we believe in another.

54:44.881 --> 54:48.317
Finally we realise all beliefs
are just lies.

54:49.352 --> 54:50.944
Why are you always
looking at your watch?

54:51.187 --> 54:51.846
Are you expecting someone?

54:52.722 --> 54:55.714
A bad habit I picked up from a friend.

54:56.026 --> 54:57.288
He says time is valuable.

54:57.594 --> 55:00.222
We Chinese waste a lot of time.

55:02.265 --> 55:03.027
What a shame.

55:03.366 --> 55:05.061
I still can't read foreign numbers!

55:05.535 --> 55:06.832
I'll never keep good time.

55:09.639 --> 55:10.071
What is happening?

55:10.307 --> 55:13.276
Reporting Sir, the wounded
are flooding into the embassy.

55:14.377 --> 55:19.974
Don't worry, let the wounded in first.
We will take care of everyone.

55:20.350 --> 55:25.879
Stay where you are.

55:32.796 --> 55:35.458
Don't be afraid.

55:36.199 --> 55:38.030
Foon, take them upstairs.

55:41.905 --> 55:43.770
They're foreign merchants
and their families.

55:44.007 --> 55:45.304
They've been attacked by White Lotus

55:45.475 --> 55:47.033
and have come to seek refuge.

55:49.913 --> 55:50.971
Have they found the doctor yet?

55:51.181 --> 55:52.113
He is on the way.

55:52.215 --> 55:53.682
Go and get him now!

55:54.017 --> 55:55.382
He is bleeding badly,
what'd we do then?

55:55.719 --> 55:56.344
What to do now?

55:56.619 --> 55:58.086
Stop the bleeding,
the doctor is on the way!

55:58.288 --> 55:59.084
They need a doctor.

55:59.622 --> 56:00.589
Master is the one they need.

56:00.957 --> 56:01.355
Master.

56:05.729 --> 56:06.855
Excuse me. Sir!

56:07.297 --> 56:08.457
They're looking for a doctor.

56:08.598 --> 56:09.963
They don't want Chinese doctors.

56:10.200 --> 56:14.136
We prefer western medicine.

56:17.774 --> 56:18.934
They don't want Chinese doctors.

56:26.082 --> 56:26.707
Dr. Sun, ask them

56:27.751 --> 56:28.115
Mr. Wong.

56:30.420 --> 56:31.114
This is...

56:31.287 --> 56:31.844
No need to introduce me. He's the one

56:32.122 --> 56:34.090
who's always looking at his watch.

56:56.813 --> 56:57.507
Burn it down!

57:05.455 --> 57:07.218
White Lotus are making trouble again.

57:14.130 --> 57:14.528
Mr. Luke.

57:18.435 --> 57:20.027
Which one tells the right time?

57:20.603 --> 57:22.901
Your watch is fast. Sun.

57:23.239 --> 57:25.207
Mine can't keep up with yours.

57:25.475 --> 57:26.806
Enough of this,
let's check the injured.

57:27.043 --> 57:27.532
OK.

57:31.581 --> 57:34.141
Foon, I never thought
time was so important.

57:38.655 --> 57:39.747
I didn't think you'd understand.

57:44.060 --> 57:46.255
Burn the foreign devils!
Chase them out!

58:06.516 --> 58:07.141
13th Aunt?

58:07.951 --> 58:10.385
Oh, no, they must have taken her soul!

58:10.587 --> 58:12.418
If they're so clever,
they would have won by now.

58:12.856 --> 58:14.448
They're just trying to scare us.

58:15.191 --> 58:15.987
Don't worry

58:16.226 --> 58:17.454
just relax.

58:20.864 --> 58:21.888
What if she vomits?

58:24.601 --> 58:25.226
We're not on the train now.

58:30.974 --> 58:32.407
Try to contact Dr. Lee.

58:32.609 --> 58:33.371
Yes, sir!

58:34.444 --> 58:36.776
I'm afraid
we don't have enough anaesthetic.

58:38.147 --> 58:39.944
Then tell me, what do you suggest?

58:41.818 --> 58:45.083
Mr. Luke, ask Wong to come in.

58:46.122 --> 58:46.679
Feeling better?

58:48.358 --> 58:50.553
Mr Wong, Dr. Sun would like you

58:50.793 --> 58:52.090
to help him.

58:52.962 --> 58:53.519
Where is he?

58:53.730 --> 58:54.754
He's in the reception hall.

58:55.298 --> 58:57.061
OK, lead the way.

01:00:39.936 --> 01:00:45.533
He said thank you. He's never seen
anything like this. He's amazed.

01:00:45.742 --> 01:00:49.143
I'm filled with the utmost admiration
and respect.

01:00:49.412 --> 01:00:50.379
He said thank you.

01:00:50.647 --> 01:00:52.239
He has never seen anything like this.

01:00:52.415 --> 01:00:54.349
He said his view was broadened and
he admired and respected that so much.

01:00:54.617 --> 01:00:56.141
Not at all, saving lives
is what matters.

01:00:56.352 --> 01:00:59.617
Doctor Wong says nothing
is more important than saving lives.

01:01:18.274 --> 01:01:21.243
Be calm! Keep clear of the window!

01:01:22.378 --> 01:01:23.242
Call for reinforcements!

01:01:23.446 --> 01:01:24.003
Yes, sir!

01:01:25.481 --> 01:01:25.913
What's happening?

01:01:26.049 --> 01:01:28.176
13th Aunt, don't, stay with me.

01:01:28.484 --> 01:01:30.281
I won't leave you.

01:01:32.188 --> 01:01:32.745
The children!

01:01:38.728 --> 01:01:40.855
Watch out. Dr. Sun. Get down.

01:01:51.340 --> 01:01:52.136
Urgent telegram.

01:01:52.575 --> 01:01:56.477
The Consulate is under attack.
Deploy troops and prepare for evacuation.

01:01:59.615 --> 01:02:00.946
The army have closed Telegraph House.

01:02:01.551 --> 01:02:03.075
We've lost contact with Hong Kong.

01:02:03.753 --> 01:02:05.243
Are we still going ahead with our plans?

01:02:06.622 --> 01:02:07.316
It's too risky.

01:02:07.890 --> 01:02:10.222
We'd better lay low for now.

01:02:14.197 --> 01:02:15.164
Let's split up and tell the others.

01:02:15.832 --> 01:02:17.561
The telex at the consulate

01:02:17.934 --> 01:02:19.868
is the only way we can contact them.

01:02:20.870 --> 01:02:22.735
Mr. Luke, you know how to send a telex.

01:02:23.072 --> 01:02:25.063
Stay here and keep contact
with the outside world.

01:02:26.642 --> 01:02:27.438
Sun. I...

01:02:27.643 --> 01:02:29.440
I've taken care of your family.

01:02:29.812 --> 01:02:31.040
I'll go back to the villa now

01:02:31.214 --> 01:02:32.408
and then go on to the wedding.

01:02:32.915 --> 01:02:34.780
If you don't get a message from me...

01:02:35.118 --> 01:02:36.278
take the boat to Hong Kong

01:02:36.486 --> 01:02:38.351
tomorrow morning.

01:02:41.190 --> 01:02:43.181
Don't be late.

01:02:43.826 --> 01:02:45.259
Take my watch with you.

01:02:46.262 --> 01:02:48.355
If I fail...

01:02:49.198 --> 01:02:50.392
carry on the fight.

01:02:53.703 --> 01:02:54.601
I will.

01:03:01.410 --> 01:03:02.434
Dr. Sun, are you leaving?

01:03:02.645 --> 01:03:03.202
I've got something to do.

01:03:03.412 --> 01:03:04.777
I'll see you out.

01:03:04.947 --> 01:03:05.606
Thank you.

01:03:07.617 --> 01:03:08.208
Stay here.

01:03:09.152 --> 01:03:10.119
Be careful, Fei hung.

01:03:10.453 --> 01:03:12.250
The White Lotus Sect will drive

01:03:12.555 --> 01:03:13.988
the foreigners out!

01:03:17.627 --> 01:03:18.059
Dr. Sun, ask them

01:03:18.661 --> 01:03:19.491
how will you get out?

01:03:25.768 --> 01:03:27.292
It's easier to save men
than their country.

01:03:27.937 --> 01:03:29.097
It seems my medical case

01:03:29.605 --> 01:03:30.902
and I can't save them all.

01:03:32.375 --> 01:03:34.240
Move!

01:03:34.377 --> 01:03:34.866
Get them out of here!

01:03:35.578 --> 01:03:41.016
Get out of here! Go!

01:03:42.185 --> 01:03:43.550
See you later, Master Wong.

01:03:47.557 --> 01:03:49.320
Sir, we just want
to expel the foreigners.

01:03:49.525 --> 01:03:51.618
We wouldn't
kill our own people.

01:03:52.128 --> 01:03:53.152
I'm glad to hear it.

01:03:53.429 --> 01:03:55.124
Leave the negotiating to us.

01:03:55.398 --> 01:03:56.729
If you were so capable

01:03:56.999 --> 01:03:58.626
we wouldn't have lost so much land.

01:04:04.941 --> 01:04:05.737
If you continue to make trouble

01:04:05.908 --> 01:04:06.897
I'll arrest you all.

01:04:07.243 --> 01:04:09.507
Take the altar away.

01:04:14.183 --> 01:04:16.014
Yes, sir. General Lan is here, make way.

01:04:22.959 --> 01:04:25.985
Why have they all come in?

01:04:26.729 --> 01:04:28.253
OK, get out of here!

01:04:28.564 --> 01:04:30.794
You are not permitted to enter,
leave at once.

01:04:31.534 --> 01:04:35.402
We suspect you are harbouring a criminal.
His name is Sun Yat Sen.

01:04:35.605 --> 01:04:37.505
I have an order to arrest him.

01:04:37.707 --> 01:04:38.833
This is British Territory!

01:04:39.041 --> 01:04:41.168
You are now in China! Not in Britain!

01:04:41.310 --> 01:04:42.334
You shouldn't talk to me like that!

01:04:42.712 --> 01:04:46.478
I'm sorry, but according to International
law, we are not under your jurisdiction

01:04:46.749 --> 01:04:49.013
and you have no right to search
the British Consulate.

01:04:50.086 --> 01:04:52.020
We do not intend to offend anybody.

01:04:54.056 --> 01:04:55.580
Please leave!

01:04:55.625 --> 01:04:56.751
I see Mr. Luke is hiding here as well.

01:04:57.627 --> 01:05:00.289
Get off the premises! Commander,
you must leave now!

01:05:00.429 --> 01:05:01.794
Mr. Luke.

01:05:07.503 --> 01:05:08.470
Let's go!
Yes, sir.

01:05:18.514 --> 01:05:21.176
Sam Fok, cut the wire pole down.

01:05:23.019 --> 01:05:24.884
I want to stop all communications.

01:05:26.656 --> 01:05:30.456
An army without information
is a dead army.

01:05:31.961 --> 01:05:33.326
As soldiers we are men of the world.

01:05:34.130 --> 01:05:36.030
We must do what is best.

01:05:36.232 --> 01:05:36.857
Sir...

01:05:37.767 --> 01:05:39.894
I know, just follow my orders.

01:05:40.136 --> 01:05:40.625
Yes, sir.

01:05:42.738 --> 01:05:44.205
This way, Commander.

01:05:49.111 --> 01:05:52.274
Carry out the General's instructions.

01:05:53.883 --> 01:05:57.046
They protect the rebels
because they want to subjugate us.

01:05:57.420 --> 01:05:59.888
Pull it up.

01:06:21.110 --> 01:06:22.168
You may start now.

01:06:31.053 --> 01:06:32.714
What is going on?

01:06:32.922 --> 01:06:37.256
Gun fire!
Don't be distracted! Stay alert!

01:06:39.662 --> 01:06:40.128
Yes!

01:06:41.030 --> 01:06:42.327
If you are all up for this

01:06:42.898 --> 01:06:44.126
let's practise some kung fu.

01:06:46.168 --> 01:06:48.602
Once you have your stance, don't move.

01:06:48.804 --> 01:06:49.930
This is the Hanging Horse.

01:06:50.272 --> 01:06:55.938
One move and you're steady as a rock.
This stance brings unlimited power.

01:06:56.412 --> 01:07:00.075
Perform the Unicorn Move.
Third move...

01:07:00.249 --> 01:07:02.911
Hold the head, grab the hand, twist!

01:07:03.886 --> 01:07:07.913
Watch carefully!
Return to your original position.

01:07:08.991 --> 01:07:12.518
And again! Not bad.

01:07:12.895 --> 01:07:14.260
Hold that stance for two hours.

01:07:16.966 --> 01:07:17.523
Foon!

01:07:18.968 --> 01:07:21.801
Hold the head, grab the hand, twist!

01:07:22.371 --> 01:07:23.303
Grappling Hand?

01:07:23.773 --> 01:07:25.070
Yes. I've learned it

01:07:25.274 --> 01:07:26.832
but I don't know how to use it.

01:07:27.443 --> 01:07:29.911
That's easy. I'll attack
and you counter attack.

01:07:30.813 --> 01:07:31.336
Watch.

01:07:38.854 --> 01:07:41.118
Is it this way?
It doesn't feel right.

01:07:41.590 --> 01:07:42.921
Foon, what are you doing?

01:07:43.959 --> 01:07:45.187
Why are you holding 13th Aunt?

01:07:46.562 --> 01:07:47.654
I'm teaching her Grappling Hand.

01:07:48.497 --> 01:07:49.862
You teach her?

01:07:50.232 --> 01:07:51.699
Do you think I can't teach her?

01:07:52.001 --> 01:07:53.593
It's not right for you to hold 13th Aunt.

01:07:54.003 --> 01:07:55.834
Knee bends, now!

01:07:58.774 --> 01:07:59.263
Master. I...

01:07:59.442 --> 01:08:00.238
Now!

01:08:05.281 --> 01:08:08.978
Stop looking at me.
Carry on!

01:08:12.388 --> 01:08:14.879
I'm going, Master.

01:08:18.993 --> 01:08:19.823
What are you doing?

01:08:20.529 --> 01:08:21.928
The stance.

01:08:22.765 --> 01:08:23.697
That's not the way!

01:08:27.036 --> 01:08:29.060
Fei hung, don't be angry with Foon

01:08:29.904 --> 01:08:31.395
I asked him to teach me.

01:08:32.041 --> 01:08:32.904
You did?

01:08:39.648 --> 01:08:41.013
Why don't you ask him to come back?

01:08:42.885 --> 01:08:43.977
Go on, then.

01:08:49.625 --> 01:08:50.990
I'm punished for this?

01:08:51.227 --> 01:08:53.194
What would happen if I
taught her the Bear Hug?

01:09:00.970 --> 01:09:02.437
These foreigners are really lazy!

01:09:03.072 --> 01:09:05.563
If White Lotus came, you'd be a goner.

01:09:10.880 --> 01:09:11.938
Trying to scare me?

01:09:53.988 --> 01:09:55.320
Wait for her to come down.

01:09:59.128 --> 01:10:01.995
Mr. Luke.

01:10:04.099 --> 01:10:05.623
Have you seen Foon?

01:10:07.736 --> 01:10:08.259
The White Lotus Sect?

01:10:08.470 --> 01:10:10.301
Help!

01:10:18.080 --> 01:10:19.172
White Lotus is here!

01:10:29.525 --> 01:10:29.957
Foreigner evil.

01:10:43.339 --> 01:10:44.067
They're here!

01:10:50.012 --> 01:10:51.445
Wind and fire come together...

01:10:51.680 --> 01:10:53.307
Kill all foreigners.

01:10:53.515 --> 01:10:55.039
by driving evil away!

01:10:55.284 --> 01:10:57.377
Eradicate all evil!

01:10:57.953 --> 01:10:59.580
Go and hide and don't come out.

01:10:59.822 --> 01:11:00.550
I'll be right back.

01:11:12.034 --> 01:11:12.363
Who is that?

01:11:13.302 --> 01:11:13.961
Mr. Luke?
Yes.

01:11:44.767 --> 01:11:45.597
Dr. Wong

01:11:50.239 --> 01:11:51.706
Upstairs.

01:11:51.874 --> 01:11:53.136
you Go first.

01:12:29.011 --> 01:12:29.807
General...

01:12:30.079 --> 01:12:31.205
Be quiet.

01:12:39.822 --> 01:12:42.347
Now you'll die, you little brats!

01:12:43.192 --> 01:12:44.352
The stance.

01:13:03.479 --> 01:13:04.002
Master!

01:13:04.413 --> 01:13:06.540
Foon, take care of these

01:13:07.383 --> 01:13:08.350
I'll handle the horses.

01:13:20.763 --> 01:13:21.525
Get off!

01:13:39.848 --> 01:13:40.337
Where are you running to?

01:13:50.259 --> 01:13:51.351
Foon, tie them up.

01:13:51.827 --> 01:13:53.226
I'll see if there are any left.

01:13:58.600 --> 01:13:59.089
Arrest them, go!

01:13:59.301 --> 01:14:00.359
Yes, sir.

01:14:06.675 --> 01:14:07.733
Arrest the White Lotus.

01:14:08.177 --> 01:14:10.407
I have orders to protect the Consulate.

01:14:10.612 --> 01:14:11.977
You must co operate with us

01:14:12.214 --> 01:14:14.842
let my men through to search
for the rest of the rebels.

01:14:30.132 --> 01:14:30.689
Come on, hurry.

01:14:32.968 --> 01:14:34.230
I saw what you did!

01:14:34.503 --> 01:14:37.666
I saw you let the rebels go.
This is a conspiracy.

01:14:38.874 --> 01:14:40.341
What are you looking at?

01:14:40.576 --> 01:14:41.668
They are fighting.

01:14:44.246 --> 01:14:45.873
This is China, not Britain.

01:14:47.015 --> 01:14:47.674
Sir.

01:14:53.922 --> 01:14:56.482
Fei hung, General Lan killed the consul!

01:15:04.633 --> 01:15:05.156
Don't move!
Search everywhere!

01:15:05.367 --> 01:15:05.890
Yes, sir.

01:15:06.235 --> 01:15:08.430
What are you doing?

01:15:19.515 --> 01:15:21.483
Tell Sun to run for his life.

01:15:24.019 --> 01:15:28.649
Fei hung, I know you look on me
as your aunt...

01:15:30.792 --> 01:15:33.260
but you're the one for me in my heart.

01:15:39.134 --> 01:15:40.362
If we lose each other...

01:15:41.003 --> 01:15:42.334
come and find me.

01:15:52.748 --> 01:15:53.476
It's time to go.

01:16:08.497 --> 01:16:10.055
Whatever happens,
we must survive this night...

01:16:11.567 --> 01:16:15.833
so that future generations can see
a new dawn

01:16:16.939 --> 01:16:17.928
do you understand?

01:16:22.177 --> 01:16:24.907
Foon, you pretend to be Mr. Luke

01:16:26.081 --> 01:16:29.244
and distract the soldiers. If you can,
find the name book in the market for Mr. Luke.

01:16:29.484 --> 01:16:29.882
I will.

01:16:30.185 --> 01:16:32.085
Leung Foon, take this watch.

01:16:32.521 --> 01:16:34.682
Meet me at the pier at seven am.

01:16:36.458 --> 01:16:37.925
It's down to you now.

01:16:51.106 --> 01:16:51.629
Siu qun.

01:16:54.509 --> 01:16:55.567
You said my name!

01:16:56.878 --> 01:16:58.539
It's the first time you've done that.

01:17:18.567 --> 01:17:19.158
Who are you?

01:17:20.002 --> 01:17:21.731
I'm the interpreter
from the consulate, sir.

01:17:23.672 --> 01:17:24.263
Go on, then.

01:17:29.845 --> 01:17:30.743
Foon, go now.

01:17:37.753 --> 01:17:42.122
Mr. Luke.

01:17:42.624 --> 01:17:43.648
Mr. Luke?!

01:17:43.859 --> 01:17:45.121
After him!

01:17:49.698 --> 01:17:50.630
General.

01:17:50.999 --> 01:17:51.590
Wong Fei hung?

01:17:51.967 --> 01:17:54.765
Sir, I want to destroy their leader.

01:17:55.203 --> 01:17:56.170
That way I destroy the whole sect.

01:17:56.405 --> 01:17:57.463
To destroy it from the root!

01:17:57.673 --> 01:17:58.640
And who's that?

01:18:00.442 --> 01:18:01.568
Foon! Take care of 13th Aunt.
Master

01:18:01.743 --> 01:18:03.074
come and meet the General.
Sir.

01:18:03.679 --> 01:18:05.112
He was injured by the White Lotus.

01:18:05.947 --> 01:18:08.074
Sir, we can't predict what might happen.

01:18:08.583 --> 01:18:12.178
Please take care of the children.

01:18:13.121 --> 01:18:16.682
OK, I promise you.

01:18:18.193 --> 01:18:20.286
Escort Master Wong to the temple.

01:18:20.462 --> 01:18:21.087
Yes, sir.

01:18:49.825 --> 01:18:52.385
White Lotus, I want to join you.

01:18:57.399 --> 01:19:00.163
The White Lotus sect welcomes you,
our guests.

01:19:05.540 --> 01:19:07.269
Master Wong, there are so many soldiers

01:19:07.509 --> 01:19:08.339
how can we escape?

01:19:09.344 --> 01:19:10.276
The temple is so big

01:19:10.979 --> 01:19:12.378
we can just disappear.

01:19:12.614 --> 01:19:13.308
I'm sure we can get out.

01:19:13.615 --> 01:19:17.517
Under the incense.
long live the White Lotus sect.

01:19:17.919 --> 01:19:18.886
Is it safe in there?

01:19:19.955 --> 01:19:22.014
Don't worry, just relax.

01:19:25.794 --> 01:19:26.988
Anyway, we can't go back now.

01:19:27.195 --> 01:19:28.287
Let's go in, then.

01:19:34.536 --> 01:19:36.834
The Goddess comes to save all people.

01:19:37.105 --> 01:19:39.300
White Lotus is divine!
Power to the people!

01:19:39.541 --> 01:19:42.635
Our sect brings peace to the world.

01:19:42.944 --> 01:19:44.411
Prepare for our initiates.

01:19:44.846 --> 01:19:47.280
Kneel!

01:19:49.751 --> 01:19:52.914
Wong Fei hung, Leung Foon,
come to the altar.

01:19:58.894 --> 01:20:02.625
Come forward to be purified.

01:20:03.265 --> 01:20:05.028
Let the ceremony begin.

01:20:14.009 --> 01:20:16.034
Swallow the lucky token,
become a child of the sect.

01:20:16.444 --> 01:20:18.344
We are all brothers.

01:20:18.814 --> 01:20:20.975
We share a common bond

01:20:21.383 --> 01:20:23.874
for better or for worse.
for richer or for poorer

01:20:24.719 --> 01:20:26.482
all are equal.

01:20:30.125 --> 01:20:32.616
Drink this
and you'll be a member forever.

01:20:32.928 --> 01:20:36.295
May lightning strike down
all those who betray us.

01:20:36.965 --> 01:20:37.863
Master!

01:20:38.066 --> 01:20:40.432
Be loyal before God. Drink it!

01:20:53.582 --> 01:20:55.106
Goddess, lend me your powers!

01:20:55.350 --> 01:20:57.443
Protected by God,
nothing can harm me

01:20:58.820 --> 01:21:00.253
A thousand knives are deflected.

01:21:00.488 --> 01:21:03.048
A million blades are deflected.

01:21:04.826 --> 01:21:07.056
Protected by God,
nothing can harm me

01:21:10.065 --> 01:21:12.465
Nothing can penetrate!

01:21:12.701 --> 01:21:14.362
Master Wong!

01:21:16.137 --> 01:21:17.035
You're despicable.

01:21:18.974 --> 01:21:19.599
Take back your evil water.

01:21:29.584 --> 01:21:33.714
Mystical power protect me!

01:21:34.022 --> 01:21:36.388
Wong Fei hung,
how dare you make trouble here!

01:21:37.158 --> 01:21:39.991
Priest Gao Kung's name is famous.

01:21:40.462 --> 01:21:41.861
But I need to see him

01:21:42.330 --> 01:21:45.128
before joining the sect.

01:21:45.767 --> 01:21:47.029
I need to see him now!

01:21:49.905 --> 01:21:52.271
We won't let you see his righteousness!

01:21:53.508 --> 01:21:56.671
You won't?
I'll fight my way in, then!

01:22:00.949 --> 01:22:01.643
White Lotus
How dare you!

01:22:02.417 --> 01:22:03.475
Leave here.

01:22:09.991 --> 01:22:11.515
Surround him!

01:22:11.760 --> 01:22:13.193
You'll have to look out for yourself.

01:22:17.165 --> 01:22:19.292
Sky, wind, earth, fire,
eight stances to challenge you!

01:22:21.002 --> 01:22:21.934
Surround him!

01:22:22.137 --> 01:22:23.399
You're all frauds!

01:22:27.375 --> 01:22:28.603
That's enough.

01:22:44.125 --> 01:22:47.925
God...

01:22:54.502 --> 01:22:55.799
It's all a deception!

01:22:56.871 --> 01:22:59.669
Mystical power protect me!

01:22:59.908 --> 01:23:05.676
Gao Kung, why don't you come out?

01:23:09.250 --> 01:23:10.945
This whole thing is a fraud.

01:23:11.152 --> 01:23:12.278
I want to reveal the truth.

01:23:14.589 --> 01:23:19.288
Protect the altar!

01:23:20.061 --> 01:23:24.020
White Lotus brothers, kill him!

01:23:28.903 --> 01:23:30.268
I'll fight you to the death.

01:23:46.621 --> 01:23:47.952
Come and fight me if you dare!

01:23:51.259 --> 01:23:52.749
God will protect us.

01:23:52.994 --> 01:23:56.521
Go ahead...

01:23:56.731 --> 01:23:58.699
Stop, or I'll shoot!

01:23:59.901 --> 01:24:00.765
Can't you see this idol

01:24:01.136 --> 01:24:02.728
cannot protect you?

01:24:03.071 --> 01:24:04.265
You must stop believing in it.

01:24:04.606 --> 01:24:07.370
You are the one who lies.
Yeah!

01:24:07.675 --> 01:24:08.107
You...

01:24:08.343 --> 01:24:09.071
Mr. Luke

01:24:09.744 --> 01:24:11.541
Come this way

01:24:11.880 --> 01:24:12.608
and we'll see who doesn't die.

01:24:13.481 --> 01:24:14.277
Let me through!

01:24:19.154 --> 01:24:21.452
God will protect me.
Your gun doesn't scare me!

01:24:21.923 --> 01:24:28.761
God will protect you!
The body is as strong as iron!

01:24:29.030 --> 01:24:31.328
Little girl, you will lose your life.
Get back!

01:24:31.733 --> 01:24:32.825
Protected by God, nothing can harm us.

01:24:33.535 --> 01:24:37.869
Between the two there is White Lotus
Keeping our country safe

01:24:39.174 --> 01:24:40.334
Don't be afraid of him!

01:24:40.608 --> 01:24:41.233
Come on, hurry.

01:24:44.813 --> 01:24:45.711
I've shot the girl!

01:24:45.947 --> 01:24:46.777
Don't worry about that now.

01:24:47.115 --> 01:24:47.740
You first.

01:25:00.395 --> 01:25:01.157
Stay there!

01:25:01.796 --> 01:25:02.353
Look at these people.

01:25:02.797 --> 01:25:05.357
They're giving up their lives
for this idol.

01:25:06.101 --> 01:25:07.830
Mr. Luke, let's go!

01:25:08.937 --> 01:25:10.097
If they're all like that

01:25:10.872 --> 01:25:11.839
how will they ever change?

01:25:12.607 --> 01:25:14.939
They know nothing else.

01:25:25.386 --> 01:25:28.219
Surround him!

01:25:28.790 --> 01:25:29.916
There's nowhere to run to.

01:25:31.659 --> 01:25:36.221
We can't escape.
Don't let them get away!

01:25:59.787 --> 01:26:01.084
Beloved God, take over my body.

01:26:03.424 --> 01:26:04.823
God will protect my body giving me

01:26:05.093 --> 01:26:06.924
power to exorcise the evil spirits.

01:26:14.702 --> 01:26:18.570
With God in my body,
I'll teach you the true way.

01:26:19.340 --> 01:26:23.504
How dare you wake me to come here

01:26:24.212 --> 01:26:28.979
you fools!

01:26:29.150 --> 01:26:30.082
Anger the gods and bring them to earth.
I'll teach you!

01:26:31.953 --> 01:26:33.887
Come out, or I'll burn my own altar.

01:26:38.660 --> 01:26:40.059
Gao Kung, the righteous, is here.

01:27:04.419 --> 01:27:07.183
Welcome Priest Gao Kung
from the South Heaven Gate.

01:27:07.522 --> 01:27:09.285
The invincible Gao Kung!

01:27:22.870 --> 01:27:26.636
The universe is controlled by him!

01:27:28.610 --> 01:27:31.101
I became a disciple
of the White Lotus Goddess.

01:27:31.379 --> 01:27:33.643
The Goddess personally taught me.
She instructed me to set up an altar

01:27:34.015 --> 01:27:36.108
to exorcise the evil spirits
and save us from this impure world.

01:27:36.618 --> 01:27:39.746
Come spirit!

01:27:40.221 --> 01:27:43.748
Come, spirit!

01:27:43.958 --> 01:27:44.890
Here I come!

01:28:24.932 --> 01:28:25.762
Protect the altar.

01:28:29.370 --> 01:28:30.166
Stop.

01:28:39.947 --> 01:28:40.743
Come down here!

01:28:45.787 --> 01:28:46.481
Be gone!

01:28:58.700 --> 01:29:01.294
Trap him! Come on!
Yes, sir!

01:29:08.543 --> 01:29:09.441
Why do you need help?

01:29:09.577 --> 01:29:10.703
I'll do what it takes!

01:29:20.655 --> 01:29:21.553
Now!

01:29:26.327 --> 01:29:26.884
Set up the altar.

01:29:29.564 --> 01:29:30.360
Steady!
Yes, sir!

01:29:32.300 --> 01:29:34.165
You set up a useless altar.

01:29:34.569 --> 01:29:35.297
Come up here!

01:29:36.437 --> 01:29:38.530
Supreme Being, come into my body!

01:29:40.742 --> 01:29:41.834
I'll leave this broken altar for you.

01:29:48.182 --> 01:29:51.583
Steady, steady!

01:29:51.753 --> 01:29:52.811
How dare you!

01:29:55.223 --> 01:29:56.281
How dare you wreck my altar!

01:29:58.893 --> 01:29:59.882
Protect Priest Kung.

01:30:06.100 --> 01:30:07.226
Use the cloth as an altar.

01:30:09.637 --> 01:30:11.161
Do you want to die?

01:30:13.040 --> 01:30:14.598
Supreme Being, four Guardians of Heaven

01:30:14.876 --> 01:30:18.573
come to my aid.

01:30:18.846 --> 01:30:20.939
Destroy my enemy.

01:30:21.482 --> 01:30:23.916
Guardian of Anger!

01:30:24.085 --> 01:30:26.383
Guardian of Mercy!

01:30:27.555 --> 01:30:28.522
Little girl.

01:30:28.723 --> 01:30:33.387
Guardian of Defiance! Come!

01:30:33.795 --> 01:30:36.593
Gao Kung, you've summoned all the guardians!

01:30:37.465 --> 01:30:38.329
Are you ready yet?

01:30:38.866 --> 01:30:40.094
If any guardian was of use,
one would be enough.

01:30:40.301 --> 01:30:41.131
You have offended them all.

01:30:42.837 --> 01:30:44.566
They will all punish you!

01:31:02.990 --> 01:31:03.979
Death to you, the guardian's enemy!

01:31:10.631 --> 01:31:11.620
Die now!

01:31:23.110 --> 01:31:24.338
Wind somersault!

01:31:26.347 --> 01:31:28.212
Mighty strike!

01:31:30.318 --> 01:31:31.046
Evil being!

01:31:34.622 --> 01:31:36.180
Priest Kung is invincible.

01:31:36.390 --> 01:31:38.915
He will exorcise all evil!

01:31:41.629 --> 01:31:42.755
Get down!

01:31:46.434 --> 01:31:47.731
No Shadow Kick from Fushan!

01:31:50.271 --> 01:31:51.101
Protect Gao Kung!

01:31:57.044 --> 01:31:57.703
Killer Cloth!

01:32:08.890 --> 01:32:09.914
I am not any sort of god.

01:32:10.591 --> 01:32:11.216
I'm Wong Fei hung!

01:32:12.226 --> 01:32:13.784
Can't you tell gods from what is not?

01:32:16.564 --> 01:32:18.225
Wong Fei hung, prepare to die!

01:32:24.305 --> 01:32:25.135
White Lotus opens up!

01:32:33.481 --> 01:32:34.140
Put your feet on the ground.

01:32:39.086 --> 01:32:40.075
It's all a deception.

01:32:43.424 --> 01:32:45.585
Wong Fei hung,
how dare you challenge the gods!

01:32:47.895 --> 01:32:49.123
Gods don't burn!

01:32:49.330 --> 01:32:50.092
If that's true, there's no justice.

01:32:58.372 --> 01:32:59.703
Solar explosion!

01:33:11.752 --> 01:33:17.315
Gao Kung.
Your show is over now.

01:33:20.761 --> 01:33:21.728
You demon!

01:33:21.996 --> 01:33:24.328
You say believe in God
and peace will reign.

01:33:24.732 --> 01:33:25.824
How many people have you killed?

01:33:26.133 --> 01:33:27.964
Let's see you survive this!

01:33:37.111 --> 01:33:38.669
Nobody can stop me!
I can.

01:33:45.453 --> 01:33:47.478
Claw Knife!

01:34:09.644 --> 01:34:10.406
A metal plate!

01:34:11.412 --> 01:34:13.141
His magical powers amount to this.

01:34:16.350 --> 01:34:17.647
Now they've no god

01:34:18.119 --> 01:34:19.552
they must look after themselves.

01:34:20.454 --> 01:34:22.354
Mystical powers protect me!

01:34:22.556 --> 01:34:25.389
Master!

01:34:25.626 --> 01:34:29.653
How can this happen?

01:34:31.966 --> 01:34:32.660
Let's go.

01:34:40.474 --> 01:34:44.308
What kind of number...?

01:34:44.845 --> 01:34:46.107
I can't even read it.
this is no use to me.

01:34:48.983 --> 01:34:49.472
Master!

01:34:50.651 --> 01:34:52.278
Good, we meet again.

01:34:56.490 --> 01:34:57.787
It's six o'clock, there's still time.

01:34:58.492 --> 01:34:59.516
Hey, where is the name book?

01:35:00.227 --> 01:35:02.024
Name book? Oh, no!

01:35:02.496 --> 01:35:04.020
I was distracted by the soldiers

01:35:04.231 --> 01:35:05.198
and forgot it!

01:35:05.599 --> 01:35:06.588
Why are you so careless?!

01:35:07.468 --> 01:35:08.264
I'll go back and get it.

01:35:08.769 --> 01:35:09.997
Do we have enough time?

01:35:10.204 --> 01:35:12.001
I must get it,
it's a matter of life and death.

01:35:14.141 --> 01:35:14.664
Let's go.

01:35:22.283 --> 01:35:24.683
Mr. Luke, it's well guarded,
do we have to go in?

01:35:24.919 --> 01:35:26.386
I must get the name book.

01:35:26.787 --> 01:35:28.379
The boat leaves in 30 minutes.

01:35:28.856 --> 01:35:30.847
We can't be late meeting Sun at the pier.

01:35:34.795 --> 01:35:35.454
Wait there.

01:35:48.943 --> 01:35:50.808
Foon, see if Mr. Luke is ready yet.

01:35:51.479 --> 01:35:52.070
I'll keep watch.

01:35:55.449 --> 01:35:56.814
Mr. Luke, can I help?

01:35:56.984 --> 01:35:57.678
I've got it, let's go.

01:36:01.222 --> 01:36:02.746
Soldiers, let's hide.

01:36:10.798 --> 01:36:12.356
Master Wong, this way.
Master

01:36:15.970 --> 01:36:18.564
Come on, hurry up!

01:36:22.443 --> 01:36:23.341
I'm going to die this time.

01:36:23.611 --> 01:36:24.441
Help him up.

01:36:26.580 --> 01:36:27.569
Where are you hurt?

01:36:28.015 --> 01:36:29.346
Let me have a look!

01:36:29.850 --> 01:36:31.374
It hurts, it really hurts.

01:36:35.356 --> 01:36:37.756
Luckily they shot your watch...

01:36:41.695 --> 01:36:42.423
Mr. Luke!

01:36:42.930 --> 01:36:43.919
Get down!

01:36:53.340 --> 01:36:54.102
Foon, you go first.

01:36:54.942 --> 01:36:56.500
Mr. Luke, I'll carry you.

01:36:59.180 --> 01:37:00.044
This way, Master.

01:37:12.159 --> 01:37:12.784
Don't move!

01:37:21.735 --> 01:37:23.202
Master, there's a way out.

01:37:24.371 --> 01:37:24.962
There's a way out.

01:37:26.841 --> 01:37:27.739
Are you all right?

01:37:28.209 --> 01:37:29.733
I can't go on.

01:37:30.077 --> 01:37:31.772
Leave me here.

01:37:34.815 --> 01:37:35.304
Let me help you.

01:37:37.117 --> 01:37:41.019
The name book is vitally important.

01:37:41.622 --> 01:37:43.089
Don't let the Government have it or

01:37:43.490 --> 01:37:45.856
many Chinese people will be killed.

01:37:47.194 --> 01:37:48.218
Take me over there.

01:37:55.536 --> 01:37:58.096
You can't burn this cloth.

01:37:58.939 --> 01:38:03.035
Master Wong, I beg you,
deliver this to Sun personally.

01:38:03.344 --> 01:38:06.871
Tell him I died for the revolution.

01:38:07.548 --> 01:38:09.209
He must live for the revolution.

01:38:15.890 --> 01:38:17.619
There's blood here.
They're over there!

01:38:18.692 --> 01:38:19.989
Foon, look after Mr. Luke.

01:38:30.971 --> 01:38:31.767
General Lan?

01:38:34.909 --> 01:38:36.240
We meet again.

01:38:37.344 --> 01:38:38.834
Arrest the rebels!
Yes, sir!

01:38:41.548 --> 01:38:42.139
Hold it.

01:38:42.583 --> 01:38:43.242
What are you burning?

01:38:46.120 --> 01:38:47.849
Wong Fei hung, this will be

01:38:48.088 --> 01:38:49.646
our last chance to spar.

01:38:50.324 --> 01:38:53.293
I wonder how many of my moves
you can withstand.

01:38:55.262 --> 01:38:56.286
Give me that now!

01:38:58.132 --> 01:38:58.996
Here you are!

01:39:07.007 --> 01:39:07.530
How dare you!

01:39:34.902 --> 01:39:36.665
The name book? Hand it over.

01:39:40.107 --> 01:39:41.734
Foon, stay where you are.

01:39:41.875 --> 01:39:42.466
Carry on with what you're doing.

01:39:42.843 --> 01:39:43.571
Don't come over.

01:39:45.646 --> 01:39:46.635
Master, take care.

01:40:00.661 --> 01:40:01.093
Mr. Luke.

01:40:07.701 --> 01:40:09.669
Lan, didn't you want to test me?

01:40:13.374 --> 01:40:13.897
Wong Fei hung?

01:40:19.546 --> 01:40:20.308
Come on, then!

01:40:27.287 --> 01:40:27.912
Come down!

01:40:28.689 --> 01:40:29.587
You come up!

01:40:34.762 --> 01:40:35.421
Come down!

01:40:41.935 --> 01:40:42.697
You wanted to fight?

01:40:45.305 --> 01:40:46.431
Son of a bitch! This is too much!

01:40:47.941 --> 01:40:49.636
Why aren't you down yet?

01:40:53.414 --> 01:40:53.903
Mr. Luke.

01:40:55.282 --> 01:41:03.246
Time... is vital.

01:41:03.524 --> 01:41:07.824
Be on time... at the pier.
Meet Sun Yat sen.

01:41:09.563 --> 01:41:10.120
Mr. Luke.

01:41:15.702 --> 01:41:16.361
Mr. Luke.

01:42:12.426 --> 01:42:14.860
Wong Fei hung, there's no way out!
Come back.

01:42:16.530 --> 01:42:18.361
You killed the British consul

01:42:19.166 --> 01:42:23.102
everyone will know sooner or later.

01:42:24.338 --> 01:42:27.239
There's no way out for you either.
Well... we're both doomed, then.

01:43:35.475 --> 01:43:36.533
Foon, you can't burn that cloth!

01:44:07.174 --> 01:44:07.731
Master!

01:44:08.208 --> 01:44:09.072
Foon, go quickly.

01:44:09.276 --> 01:44:10.038
Time is vital.

01:44:29.396 --> 01:44:30.522
It's a dead end

01:44:30.697 --> 01:44:31.789
there's no way out.

01:44:40.474 --> 01:44:41.406
Foon, what time is it now?

01:44:43.043 --> 01:44:44.169
I can't tell the time

01:44:45.112 --> 01:44:45.840
but it's getting light.

01:45:03.163 --> 01:45:04.357
There's not much time left.

01:45:07.334 --> 01:45:09.529
Mr. Sun must meet Mr. Luke
before he sails.

01:45:16.943 --> 01:45:17.602
Wong Fei hung?

01:45:20.013 --> 01:45:21.742
Please give me the name book

01:45:22.482 --> 01:45:24.143
so I can go back to the Governor.

01:45:26.853 --> 01:45:27.877
He won't let us go.

01:45:28.455 --> 01:45:29.114
Try and find a way out.

01:45:55.215 --> 01:45:55.772
Quick! Go!

01:45:58.085 --> 01:45:58.642
Cloth Staff!

01:46:02.489 --> 01:46:03.956
Foon, make the hole bigger.

01:46:22.576 --> 01:46:23.838
Well done!

01:46:35.989 --> 01:46:36.853
Thank you.

01:46:43.563 --> 01:46:44.291
Foon. Get out of here.

01:46:44.431 --> 01:46:45.056
I understand. Master.

01:46:58.011 --> 01:46:58.807
Master, we can go now.

01:46:59.479 --> 01:47:00.673
Yes, you can go to hell!

01:47:04.684 --> 01:47:05.548
Foon!

01:47:11.358 --> 01:47:11.949
No Shadow Kick!

01:48:02.142 --> 01:48:02.801
Master.

01:48:22.329 --> 01:48:22.954
Are you Dr. Sun?

01:48:23.330 --> 01:48:24.627
All aboard! Hurry up, everyone!
All aboard! Hurry up.

01:48:24.831 --> 01:48:25.729
We've found him.

01:48:31.304 --> 01:48:32.771
Don't move! You're coming with me.

01:48:36.843 --> 01:48:37.400
Stand back!

01:48:38.411 --> 01:48:41.175
Grab the hand, crouch down and twist.

01:48:53.927 --> 01:48:54.450
Master.

01:48:55.896 --> 01:48:59.423
Fei hung!
13th Aunt!

01:49:00.967 --> 01:49:01.797
Where is Mr. Luke?

01:49:06.840 --> 01:49:08.808
Dr. Sun!

01:49:25.492 --> 01:49:27.426
May a new dawn break over our land.

01:49:29.996 --> 01:49:32.123
May we never forget our martyr's blood.

01:49:36.703 --> 01:49:42.039
Mr. Luke, your spirit will always be
remembered in our hearts.

01:49:51.451 --> 01:49:54.181
Don't worry, I'll meet you at the pier!

01:50:23.617 --> 01:50:25.983
Foon, are you missing 13th Aunt?

01:50:26.786 --> 01:50:27.650
Are you, Master?

01:50:28.822 --> 01:50:30.119
I asked you the question.

01:50:32.592 --> 01:50:34.924
I think you're the one
who's missing her.

01:50:35.562 --> 01:50:36.187
Really?

01:50:37.305 --> 01:50:43.678
