01:11.204 --> 01:12.399
- Carson.

01:15.742 --> 01:16.742
- Hello, Sergio.

01:20.413 --> 01:21.676
- I'm so glad you came.

01:23.750 --> 01:24.945
- I heard about Clarissa.

01:27.720 --> 01:29.965
- Please, my friend.

01:29.989 --> 01:30.989
Before we begin.

01:32.659 --> 01:35.026
- I thought we
trusted each other.

01:36.563 --> 01:38.156
- Always new rules, my friend.

01:39.933 --> 01:40.933
This I must take.

01:45.004 --> 01:46.004
- How did she die?

01:46.773 --> 01:47.773
- What would you like?

01:48.942 --> 01:49.966
- A beer.

01:50.076 --> 01:51.554
A good one please.

01:51.578 --> 01:52.670
- You got it, darling.

02:01.454 --> 02:02.574
- It's for your next target.

02:10.295 --> 02:11.388
- Not this shit again.

02:12.932 --> 02:14.957
- After such success
with the Amante job,

02:16.136 --> 02:18.605
you cannot be surprised
that the Patron wants more.

02:20.406 --> 02:21.450
Our enemies were terrified.

02:21.474 --> 02:22.474
Embrace your future.

02:23.710 --> 02:24.710
- I kill clean.

02:25.912 --> 02:27.607
They don't even
know they're dead.

02:27.714 --> 02:29.425
I don't kill like this.

02:29.449 --> 02:30.926
- Patron no longer wants death.

02:30.950 --> 02:31.961
He wants horror.

02:31.985 --> 02:33.419
- Sergio, I won't do it.

02:37.290 --> 02:40.419
- Patron will be very
disappointed in you.

02:48.935 --> 02:50.596
You wanted to know
about Clarissa.

02:54.073 --> 02:58.032
Patron had Lance
deliver on their fear.

02:58.144 --> 03:01.671
Does this bother you?

03:01.781 --> 03:04.827
- Is the Patron
listening right now?

03:04.851 --> 03:06.512
I imagine he'd wanna hear me die

03:06.619 --> 03:07.984
after drinking that shit.

03:10.290 --> 03:11.985
He shouldn't have killed her.

03:16.429 --> 03:19.308
- My apologies my
friend but you,

03:19.332 --> 03:22.131
you need to drink
your beer or die.

03:23.636 --> 03:24.636
For your own good.

03:27.607 --> 03:28.607
- No.

03:36.316 --> 03:37.316
Hello, Patron.

03:42.689 --> 03:45.386
You should not
have tortured her.

03:47.026 --> 03:49.688
Now we'll both have to live
with the consequences.

06:28.154 --> 06:30.179
- You there, Alice?

06:31.190 --> 06:32.334
- I'm here, Paul.

06:32.358 --> 06:33.602
And it's 5:05 in the
afternoon which means

06:33.626 --> 06:35.253
I am off duty.

06:36.229 --> 06:37.390
- Yeah, but I got this call

06:37.497 --> 06:39.875
about some disturbance
at Hatchery Lake.

06:39.899 --> 06:42.368
- Paul, I'm off,
have Dave do it.

06:43.369 --> 06:45.714
- Dave is working an
accident up at 101.

06:45.738 --> 06:46.738
So you're up.

06:49.208 --> 06:50.352
. Okay-

06:50.376 --> 06:51.376
Gimme the address.

07:41.627 --> 07:43.939
- Hey, John, how's life?

07:43.963 --> 07:46.091
- Where have you been, mom?

07:46.199 --> 07:47.724
Dad said you had news for me.

07:50.102 --> 07:52.935
- Listen, I'm gonna have
to call you later, sorry.

07:53.072 --> 07:54.832
- Is something going on
between you and Da...

08:31.611 --> 08:34.205
- Paul, I'm at the driveway.

08:34.313 --> 08:35.791
Going to check things out.

08:35.815 --> 08:36.991
- 10-4 Alice.

08:37.015 --> 08:38.677
Call if you find anything.

09:58.264 --> 10:00.096
- Shelton Police, anyone there?

10:02.501 --> 10:04.479
We have received a
report of a disturbance.

10:04.503 --> 10:06.028
I'll need to enter the premises.

12:22.208 --> 12:23.539
- Alice, is that you?

12:25.911 --> 12:26.935
Wanna get me a report?

12:29.181 --> 12:30.478
Alice, you okay out there?

12:35.020 --> 12:36.020
Come on, Alice.

12:37.022 --> 12:38.022
Answer the radio.

12:49.835 --> 12:51.530
- My name is Carson Empman.

12:54.073 --> 12:56.735
By now you will have heard of
me and the things I've done.

12:58.344 --> 13:00.489
And if you have found this
letter then I have died

13:00.513 --> 13:01.513
a contented man.

13:03.883 --> 13:06.318
I am being hunted by the
Chutro drug cartel.

13:07.520 --> 13:09.664
If their assassins find
me alive, they will bring

13:09.688 --> 13:11.383
something far worse than death.

13:12.625 --> 13:13.888
They will bring the serum.

13:15.528 --> 13:17.724
I have at most three
days to take my revenge.

13:18.898 --> 13:21.663
Then I will end my
life on my terms.

13:23.803 --> 13:26.170
For what I let
happen to Clarissa,

13:26.272 --> 13:28.070
I deserve nothing less.

13:47.793 --> 13:48.793
- You there, Paul?

13:49.762 --> 13:50.972
- Here, Alice.

13:50.996 --> 13:52.293
Why weren't you answering?

13:53.499 --> 13:56.161
- Who was it that gave you
the tip on this place?

13:56.268 --> 13:57.646
- He wouldn't give me his name.

13:57.670 --> 14:00.715
But he had a Spanish accent,
not from around here.

14:00.739 --> 14:03.401
Seemed convinced there's
some foul play out there.

14:04.510 --> 14:07.207
- Do me a favor, call the
man named Bob Sistek,

14:07.313 --> 14:08.678
he's with the FBI.

14:08.814 --> 14:10.054
Have him run a trace on the tip

14:10.082 --> 14:11.660
that we got on this place.

14:11.684 --> 14:12.684
- The FBI?

14:13.485 --> 14:15.180
Jesus, what do you
think you found?

14:16.355 --> 14:18.166
- For my entire career
with the cartel

14:18.190 --> 14:19.680
I was a ghost.

14:19.792 --> 14:21.123
No one had seen my face.

14:21.994 --> 14:24.361
To find my jobs I just
needed four words.

14:24.463 --> 14:25.463
The key.

14:26.332 --> 14:27.527
It was untraceable.

14:28.500 --> 14:31.197
But then came the offer
that ruined everything.

14:32.304 --> 14:33.669
They wanted to meet.

14:36.809 --> 14:38.334
Do I wish now I
had turned around

14:38.444 --> 14:40.139
never to work for
the cartel again?

14:41.213 --> 14:42.510
Never to have met Clarissa?

14:45.551 --> 14:47.076
No.

14:47.186 --> 14:48.186
I'd do it all again.

15:04.003 --> 15:05.003
- Good day, sir.

15:06.572 --> 15:07.733
You must be Carson, yes?

15:09.208 --> 15:11.186
Welcome to the Aguilamonte.

15:11.210 --> 15:13.907
I believe it's the most beautiful
winery outside of Spain.

15:14.914 --> 15:16.224
I am Sergio the winemaker.

15:16.248 --> 15:19.240
I am very honored to finally
meet you, my friend.

15:19.351 --> 15:21.162
- You pay a lot of
money for the chance.

15:21.186 --> 15:22.186
I hope it's worth it.

15:23.422 --> 15:24.912
- Our new Patron
certainly thinks so.

15:25.024 --> 15:26.835
He has much faith
in your talents.

15:26.859 --> 15:28.503
- New Patron?

15:28.527 --> 15:31.394
- You must learn to keep up
with current events, compadre.

15:33.232 --> 15:34.722
Come, let us meet
your new family.

15:34.833 --> 15:36.858
Those you must trust
now and forever more.

15:38.337 --> 15:39.337
- Well.

15:41.073 --> 15:43.371
As long as that means
until this job is through

15:44.276 --> 15:45.402
we see eye to eye.

16:01.193 --> 16:02.003
- It's your new family.

16:02.027 --> 16:03.838
To the left we have Anton.

16:03.862 --> 16:05.573
On your right is Lance.

16:05.597 --> 16:07.759
And the beautiful lady
in front is Clarissa.

16:11.403 --> 16:13.064
- Please, call me Doctor.

16:15.240 --> 16:16.674
- Doctor of what, exactly?

16:17.776 --> 16:18.776
- Yes, yes, yes!

16:19.545 --> 16:21.556
You are here for your
distinctive abilities.

16:21.580 --> 16:22.580
And to focus

16:23.415 --> 16:25.440
solely on the task at hand.

16:25.551 --> 16:26.928
As ordered by the Patron himself

16:26.952 --> 16:28.797
you are to share
nothing about yourself

16:28.821 --> 16:30.516
or your past with the others.

16:30.622 --> 16:33.091
- Unless one is to guess
correctly, of course.

16:34.560 --> 16:36.426
You see, I have a
particular talent.

16:37.429 --> 16:39.107
Sort of a sixth sense,
I seem to be able

16:39.131 --> 16:40.621
to guess people's worst fears.

16:42.134 --> 16:44.000
Take Anton for example.

16:44.103 --> 16:45.628
He seems to have a
particular aversion

16:45.738 --> 16:47.082
to being burned alive.

16:47.106 --> 16:48.583
- Shut your goddamn mouth.

16:48.607 --> 16:50.819
- It's roasted actually.

16:50.843 --> 16:55.323
Stuffed within a cowhide,
strung over a smoldering fire.

16:55.347 --> 16:57.659
Suffocating while his flesh
melts knowing full well

16:57.683 --> 17:02.143
that only the pain
will kill him.

17:02.254 --> 17:03.744
- Say another word and you die.

17:05.523 --> 17:09.050
- And that word will be to
the Patron, wouldn't it?

17:09.161 --> 17:10.161
- Boys.

17:11.597 --> 17:12.597
Let's get to work.

17:13.665 --> 17:15.175
- Excellent idea.

17:15.200 --> 17:16.667
Let's get started.

17:16.769 --> 17:17.964
You all follow me please.

17:41.994 --> 17:43.838
- Washington Herald.

17:43.862 --> 17:47.709
- Hello, ma'am, I'm
calling for Wendy Ludlow.

17:47.733 --> 17:49.531
I have a story for her.

17:49.635 --> 17:50.845
- One moment please.

17:50.869 --> 17:51.869
- Thank you ma'am.

17:54.573 --> 17:55.870
- This is Wendy Ludlow.

17:55.974 --> 17:56.974
Who is this?

17:58.043 --> 18:00.535
- Miss Ludlow, I'm calling
to tell you the whereabouts

18:00.646 --> 18:03.825
of Senator Enrique
Parker's son Jared.

18:03.849 --> 18:07.877
He disappeared on
September 20th 2011.

18:07.986 --> 18:10.398
- Yeah, and that
case has been closed

18:10.422 --> 18:11.566
for three years.

18:11.590 --> 18:15.403
- You can find him 50 meters
north of the 17th green

18:15.427 --> 18:17.122
at Rock Creek golf course.

18:18.163 --> 18:20.427
Bring the police and
an excavation unit.

18:21.900 --> 18:24.232
If I see the story in
tomorrow's online edition

18:24.336 --> 18:27.148
I will give you the
story of your career.

18:27.172 --> 18:29.517
- Buddy, this will be
the story of my career

18:29.541 --> 18:30.852
if you weren't full of shit.

18:30.876 --> 18:33.688
- It might be time to
raise your standards.

18:33.712 --> 18:35.857
I'll call you at five p.m.
tomorrow at your time.

18:35.881 --> 18:36.891
Wear running shoes.

18:36.915 --> 18:38.940
- But how do I know
this isn't a prank?

18:43.522 --> 18:45.100
- San Antonio Post.

18:45.124 --> 18:46.489
- Mitch Verplank please.

18:54.900 --> 18:55.900
- Alice?

18:57.136 --> 18:58.136
- Yeah?

18:59.404 --> 19:01.771
- Got a hold of
your friend Sistek.

19:01.874 --> 19:04.586
You didn't tell me he's
the guy who hired you.

19:04.610 --> 19:07.589
- Yeah well he is,
so did he help you?

19:07.613 --> 19:09.103
- He said the call came

19:09.214 --> 19:11.793
from a switchboard
station in Vegas.

19:11.817 --> 19:13.182
They can't trace it beyond that.

19:13.285 --> 19:15.763
He was also very interested
in why you were asking

19:15.787 --> 19:17.277
and wants you to call him back.

19:20.492 --> 19:21.492
- Okay, will do.

19:24.129 --> 19:25.221
So who owns this cabin?

19:26.265 --> 19:27.909
- I looked that up.

19:27.933 --> 19:29.811
Aaron Mickowitz.

19:29.835 --> 19:30.996
All paid for.

19:31.103 --> 19:32.195
Taxes are up to date.

19:33.305 --> 19:34.636
- Mind tracking him down?

19:34.740 --> 19:35.740
- Sure thing.

19:39.978 --> 19:43.937
- Family, our challenge
is a simple one.

19:45.284 --> 19:48.496
Mayor Morgan Amante
will soon be taking

19:48.520 --> 19:50.284
drastic measures
against the Cartel.

19:51.323 --> 19:52.467
Beginning with the
press conference,

19:52.491 --> 19:53.515
it'll be from Tuesday.

19:54.793 --> 19:56.557
Now leveraging your
unique talents,

19:57.663 --> 19:59.841
we will intercept him as
he emerges from City Hall

19:59.865 --> 20:01.843
on his way to the event.

20:01.867 --> 20:04.564
And the Patron wants
to make it very clear

20:04.670 --> 20:08.349
that a simple abduction is
not the desired option.

20:08.373 --> 20:09.499
. Okay-

20:09.641 --> 20:12.167
So a sniper bullet to the
head then we go have drinks.

20:13.111 --> 20:14.111
- So.

20:16.114 --> 20:18.626
The Patron wishes to
use this opportunity

20:18.650 --> 20:20.277
to test out the
finest innovation

20:21.820 --> 20:23.618
by the cartel in its
entire history.

20:26.058 --> 20:28.925
Team, I present
to you the serum.

20:30.495 --> 20:31.860
Lance here has developed this

20:31.964 --> 20:34.842
from very particular
toxins from the world's

20:34.866 --> 20:37.178
most notorious
jellyfish and spiders.

20:37.202 --> 20:38.680
- Excuse me.

20:38.704 --> 20:39.704
What does it do?

20:41.139 --> 20:43.005
- The question is,
what does it allow?

20:44.042 --> 20:46.204
Unlike conventional
paralytic elements,

20:46.311 --> 20:47.989
this formula leaves
the sympathetic

20:48.013 --> 20:50.558
nervous system unaffected.

20:50.582 --> 20:52.050
- What the hell is
he talking about?

20:52.150 --> 20:55.563
- Your heart, lungs,
anything automatic.

20:55.587 --> 20:57.282
- Leaving the patient
fully paralyzed

20:57.389 --> 20:59.915
and yet entirely
sensory capable.

21:00.025 --> 21:01.636
They can even target a
particular vertebrae

21:01.660 --> 21:03.338
and you can still talk.

21:03.362 --> 21:05.558
Or scream if needed.

21:08.600 --> 21:10.568
- What's the point?

21:10.669 --> 21:12.103
- The effect is what matters.

21:13.505 --> 21:16.351
The Patron wishes
to send a message.

21:16.375 --> 21:17.740
One that cannot be ignored.

21:35.861 --> 21:36.738
- Hey Alice.

21:36.762 --> 21:38.924
That VIN you gave me is
from a truck in California

21:39.031 --> 21:41.159
that was reported
missing two weeks ago.

21:42.801 --> 21:44.132
- Did you get Mr. Mickowitz?

21:45.137 --> 21:45.947
- Nope.

21:45.971 --> 21:47.632
No one has heard from
him in two years.

21:47.739 --> 21:51.386
He was last seen driving a
shipment of wine into Canada.

21:51.410 --> 21:52.605
Then he just disappeared.

21:53.979 --> 21:54.979
- Interesting.

21:55.881 --> 21:58.077
- So can you tell me what
you found out there?

22:00.752 --> 22:01.752
- Nothing.

22:02.821 --> 22:04.812
I guess I just needed some time

22:04.923 --> 22:07.790
to think about the
San Francisco job.

22:08.760 --> 22:11.786
- Yeah, and about
leaving us behind.

22:13.398 --> 22:16.163
- If I could do their level
of narco work here, I would.

22:17.069 --> 22:18.279
But I can't.

22:18.303 --> 22:19.303
And I need it.

22:20.172 --> 22:22.300
- But John needs you.

22:22.407 --> 22:24.952
Is taking off to
fight drug cartels

22:24.976 --> 22:26.307
really more important?

22:27.779 --> 22:31.426
Well, whatever you're
doing, our anonymous tip

22:31.450 --> 22:33.316
called back asking
about your progress.

22:34.820 --> 22:36.481
- What did you say?

22:36.588 --> 22:38.833
- I said we don't comment
on open investigations

22:38.857 --> 22:40.484
and he got pretty angry at that.

22:41.927 --> 22:43.520
How do you want me
to deal with him?

22:44.996 --> 22:49.126
- Send him to me next time.

23:10.389 --> 23:11.823
- Hello, Carson Empman.

23:15.327 --> 23:17.205
- How do you know my name?

23:17.229 --> 23:19.163
- I know everything
about this team.

23:20.966 --> 23:24.766
Names, history, sexual
preferences, everything.

23:25.837 --> 23:27.215
- I don't know much
about this new Patron

23:27.239 --> 23:29.901
but this seems like a good
way to get on his bad side.

23:31.410 --> 23:32.707
- Aren't you even curious?

23:35.747 --> 23:36.747
- No.

23:38.383 --> 23:39.383
- Hmm.

23:41.987 --> 23:46.117
Anton Delacroix has beheaded
over 200 individuals.

23:47.826 --> 23:50.671
He also feels no pain
which means he can take

23:50.695 --> 23:53.392
a substantial beating,
comes in handy.

23:56.668 --> 23:59.535
Lance Vitoros, the Doctor.

24:00.839 --> 24:02.683
Pre-eminent monster
in the cartel

24:02.707 --> 24:04.175
second only to the new Patron.

24:05.944 --> 24:08.242
He likes to say he
earned his Doctorate

24:08.346 --> 24:11.316
by studying Nazi
experimentation on the Jews.

24:13.118 --> 24:14.118
And then there's you.

24:16.521 --> 24:19.388
Carson Empman, the ghost.

24:20.559 --> 24:23.438
Seven years contracting
for the cartel.

24:23.462 --> 24:26.227
And yet not a single body found.

24:35.707 --> 24:37.471
- What else do you
know about me?

24:39.144 --> 24:40.144
- Enough.

25:12.444 --> 25:13.444
You left me to die.

25:23.421 --> 25:24.547
- Look at him.

26:03.828 --> 26:04.852
- This is Wendy.

26:04.963 --> 26:06.440
- Hello, Wendy.

26:06.464 --> 26:08.009
- Hello, mystery man.

26:08.033 --> 26:09.844
- You work fast, well done.

26:09.868 --> 26:11.045
- Thank you.

26:11.069 --> 26:13.014
You wouldn't believe the
questions that I'm getting.

26:13.038 --> 26:15.883
- Hear from the FBI, no
doubt, don't answer them.

26:15.907 --> 26:16.907
- And ATF.

26:17.909 --> 26:20.109
- You have eight minutes to
get to the bank of payphones

26:20.211 --> 26:22.703
at the southeast corner
of President's Park, go.

26:22.814 --> 26:24.625
- What, in heels, I can't.

26:24.649 --> 26:26.242
- I told you to
wear running shoes.

27:21.272 --> 27:22.917
- I am not in that
kind of shape.

27:22.941 --> 27:23.951
- Get used to it.

27:23.975 --> 27:25.386
The Feds are tracking
your phone calls.

27:25.410 --> 27:26.707
This gives us time to chat.

27:27.779 --> 27:29.269
Here's the game you
and I will play.

27:29.381 --> 27:31.926
I do something for you, and
you do something for me.

27:31.950 --> 27:34.317
I gave you a body, so in
exchange, you will add

27:34.419 --> 27:36.285
a set of information
on the web article

27:36.388 --> 27:39.066
that first published
Parker's disappearance.

27:39.090 --> 27:40.134
- Strange request.

27:40.158 --> 27:41.751
- Yeah, maybe you.

27:42.927 --> 27:43.621
Are you ready?

27:43.762 --> 27:44.762
Write this down.

27:45.830 --> 27:48.162
Cayman America's
Bank Georgetown.

27:48.266 --> 27:49.529
Hendricks.

27:50.435 --> 27:52.096
Lance Vitoros.

27:53.271 --> 27:55.899
12854196.

27:58.677 --> 28:00.042
- Got it.

28:07.318 --> 28:10.297
- You likely know I'm working
with other reporters.

28:10.321 --> 28:11.914
You are all in a competition.

28:12.957 --> 28:16.086
Whoever serves me best,
gets the grand prize.

28:17.295 --> 28:19.774
If you fail, I will replace you.

28:19.798 --> 28:22.977
If you betray me,
I pay you a visit

28:23.001 --> 28:25.527
and someone finds your
body in six years.

28:25.670 --> 28:27.365
- Don't try and sweet talk me.

28:28.707 --> 28:29.707
What's the prize?

28:30.842 --> 28:32.353
- Has anyone found who killed.

28:32.377 --> 28:34.573
Sacramento mayor Morgan Amante?

28:34.679 --> 28:36.545
- You were a part of that?

28:36.648 --> 28:38.138
You could identify the killers?

28:39.384 --> 28:40.874
- Nice chatting with you, Wendy.

29:08.246 --> 29:10.715
- Alice, you gotta tell
me what's going on.

29:12.917 --> 29:15.181
Why haven't you told John
about San Francisco?

29:17.388 --> 29:20.050
I'm sure he could tell you
why there's no point to it.

29:23.228 --> 29:26.207
- Goddammit Paul, he's
not changing my mind.

29:26.231 --> 29:29.376
- I know you want revenge
for what happened to him.

29:29.400 --> 29:30.211
But,

29:30.235 --> 29:31.600
- But what?

29:31.736 --> 29:33.101
- But he sold drugs for Chutro

29:33.204 --> 29:34.014
and he got caught.

29:34.038 --> 29:36.132
It was his choice not
to take the plea deal.

29:37.742 --> 29:39.720
- Yeah, but they got to him.

29:39.744 --> 29:41.371
They threatened him.

29:42.280 --> 29:46.114
And now he's hard.

29:46.217 --> 29:48.413
He's lost.

29:49.454 --> 29:50.751
It ruined him, Paul.

29:51.623 --> 29:54.268
- That's why he needs you.

29:54.292 --> 29:57.091
So talk to him,
Alice, all right?

29:57.195 --> 29:59.273
See what he has to say
about all of this.

29:59.297 --> 30:00.822
- You know, that's a good idea.

30:04.803 --> 30:06.447
- Okay, let's do a round
of contingencies.

30:06.471 --> 30:07.597
- Jesus, Sergio.

30:08.807 --> 30:10.451
I think we got it by now.

30:10.475 --> 30:12.273
- A plan, Anton.

30:13.444 --> 30:15.811
A plan is nothing more
than a beautiful dream.

30:15.914 --> 30:18.383
Preparation is facing
your nightmares.

30:19.884 --> 30:22.182
Let's see how we do when
things go wrong, okay?

30:26.057 --> 30:27.468
All right.

30:27.492 --> 30:29.790
Presence of additional
police units.

30:29.894 --> 30:32.573
- Escalate the hostility
and create urgency.

30:32.597 --> 30:33.621
- Good.

30:33.731 --> 30:36.644
And who evaluates
effectiveness of this?

30:36.668 --> 30:38.193
- I do.

30:38.303 --> 30:40.114
On approach, I call Lance.

30:40.138 --> 30:41.138
- Excellent.

30:42.240 --> 30:44.572
And if the subterfuge is
still not successful?

30:49.347 --> 30:50.157
Anton!

30:50.181 --> 30:52.650
- I detonate the explosives
in the trash bin.

30:52.750 --> 30:55.396
Jesus, man, why is this
shit so complicated?

30:55.420 --> 30:57.445
Why can't we just kill
the motherfucker'?

31:04.295 --> 31:05.319
- Even in here, Anton.

31:08.132 --> 31:09.476
I can smell the vines
and the barells.

31:09.500 --> 31:10.978
This is heaven!

31:11.002 --> 31:13.347
The Patron told me
personally on his deathbed

31:13.371 --> 31:15.703
that if we succeed, this
is once again all mine.

31:18.009 --> 31:19.009
But if we fail,

31:21.179 --> 31:22.669
oh Anton, if we fail.

31:25.216 --> 31:26.827
Lance, would you like
to explain to the team

31:26.851 --> 31:28.046
what you told me?

31:28.152 --> 31:29.950
- Ah, of course.

31:33.324 --> 31:36.370
Sergio has two daughters
that he loves very much

31:36.394 --> 31:38.158
but he hasn't seen
in quite a while.

31:40.865 --> 31:42.731
You'd be tied to a table,

31:42.834 --> 31:43.960
blindfolded and gagged.

31:47.205 --> 31:49.445
Your precious little angels
wouldn't be able to hear you.

31:50.308 --> 31:52.152
They'll be stuffed
in a burlap sack

31:52.176 --> 31:54.611
and we pour in starving rats.

31:56.648 --> 32:00.107
Now these rats, they
would eat ravenously.

32:01.920 --> 32:04.252
Tearing at the nubile
flesh of your daughters.

32:06.591 --> 32:09.356
And when their cries
became whimpers,

32:11.896 --> 32:14.160
they would nibble till
there was nothing left.

32:15.600 --> 32:16.795
- Okay, that's.

32:24.742 --> 32:25.742
So you can see

32:27.745 --> 32:29.907
that if you succeed you
have everything made.

32:31.582 --> 32:32.606
But if we fail, Anton.

32:37.855 --> 32:39.653
It's all light with
you, we go again?

33:09.887 --> 33:12.533
- Can't you pick
any place closer?

33:12.557 --> 33:16.152
- No, there aren't many
banks of payphones left.

33:16.260 --> 33:18.973
And I kinda like making you run.

33:18.997 --> 33:20.487
- I enjoy the exercise.

33:22.100 --> 33:24.611
So, what happens next?

33:24.635 --> 33:27.002
- You're staying on schedule
so you get another body.

33:27.105 --> 33:28.971
Her name's Catherine Gronberg.

33:29.073 --> 33:30.541
She's in Connecticut.

33:30.641 --> 33:32.486
Died July 12, 2011.

33:32.510 --> 33:34.171
- Wait a minute, Gronberg.

33:35.847 --> 33:38.839
Wasn't she that bitchy
wine magazine editor?

33:38.950 --> 33:40.941
- Wow, Wendy, you
really know your stuff.

33:42.186 --> 33:43.186
Yeah.

33:43.921 --> 33:47.901
She's in the northeast corner
of Ashton Park in Brighton.

33:47.925 --> 33:50.571
- Northeast corner of
Ashton Park Brighton.

33:50.595 --> 33:53.240
Got it, you'll see it
in tomorrow's edition.

33:53.264 --> 33:54.264
- Thank you, Wendy.

34:07.478 --> 34:08.489
- Hey mom.

34:08.513 --> 34:10.324
- Hi John, you got a second?

34:10.348 --> 34:12.179
- Yeah, on a smoke break.

34:12.283 --> 34:14.128
- Yeah I forgot that you,

34:14.152 --> 34:15.829
- Better than
shooting heroin, mom.

34:15.853 --> 34:18.665
Yeah Greg, I'll be right there.

34:18.688 --> 34:20.934
So, you finally gonna
tell me what's going on?

34:20.958 --> 34:22.221
- Look, I need your help.

34:23.360 --> 34:24.938
Do you remember a story in
the news a few weeks back

34:24.962 --> 34:27.226
about a hitman that was
confessing his kills?

34:28.132 --> 34:30.658
- Why the hell are you
calling me about this?

34:31.735 --> 34:34.762
- That guy was trying to
take down the Chutro cartel

34:34.871 --> 34:36.650
and I'm trying to figure
out how he was doing it.

34:36.674 --> 34:37.551
- Jesus, mom.

34:37.574 --> 34:39.065
Do you know what
would happen to me

34:39.177 --> 34:42.356
if the cartel found out I
was talking to the police?

34:42.380 --> 34:44.906
Don't ever call me about this.

34:45.016 --> 34:47.610
- Dammit.

34:48.886 --> 34:50.230
- Alice.

34:53.056 --> 34:54.534
- Yeah?

34:54.559 --> 34:56.721
- That same guy called again.

34:56.828 --> 34:58.660
Asked for the same update.

34:58.763 --> 35:00.574
- Why didn't you send him to me?

35:00.598 --> 35:03.397
- Because he
threatened you, Alice.

35:03.501 --> 35:05.712
Said that two men would arrive
before dark and kill you

35:05.736 --> 35:07.761
if you didn't report
what you found.

35:07.872 --> 35:10.739
So you wanna tell me what
the hell is going on?

35:12.677 --> 35:13.974
- Okay, it's probably,

35:14.078 --> 35:16.056
- I called Sistek.

35:16.080 --> 35:17.925
He sounded angry with you.

35:17.949 --> 35:19.974
He wants to know what
you're doing out there.

35:20.084 --> 35:22.746
So since he's your new
boss, you better call.

35:24.956 --> 35:26.481
- Okay, don't worry, I got it.

36:01.058 --> 36:02.058
- Mind if I sit?

36:03.928 --> 36:04.928
- Help yourself.

36:08.666 --> 36:10.998
- You're a bit more
agreeable to my presence.

36:12.270 --> 36:13.635
- You're a part of the team.

36:15.006 --> 36:16.701
Guess a rather well
informed part.

36:21.913 --> 36:25.058
- I was sent from
Bogota to review

36:25.082 --> 36:27.346
<i>as</i> well <i>as</i> assist
in the operation.

36:27.451 --> 36:28.475
- Bogota?

36:28.586 --> 36:30.764
So you have the ear
of the Patron?

36:32.790 --> 36:34.417
- Something like that.

36:42.500 --> 36:43.695
Care for a glass?

36:44.869 --> 36:47.895
- No thanks.

36:49.273 --> 36:51.367
- Wine too nuanced
a taste for you?

36:53.377 --> 36:54.708
- No, it's a.

36:56.714 --> 36:57.714
It's the insult.

36:59.383 --> 37:00.383
- The insult?

37:02.486 --> 37:03.486
- May I?

37:09.827 --> 37:11.022
Take a look at these two.

37:12.663 --> 37:16.043
The wine has been so
carefully cultivated,

37:16.067 --> 37:19.731
crafted, blended and
aged all to achieve

37:19.837 --> 37:22.863
this particular taste that we
are supposed to celebrate.

37:24.141 --> 37:26.075
For 800 bucks a bottle, no less.

37:27.345 --> 37:30.713
- 1200 actually, but go on.

37:33.584 --> 37:34.779
- And you have this beer.

37:36.587 --> 37:40.217
Made well and with
care, but not,

37:40.324 --> 37:42.292
as many would say, special.

37:43.828 --> 37:44.828
- And?

37:47.898 --> 37:49.696
- And then I shoot
them both in the head.

37:59.377 --> 38:02.074
People see the wine as a tragedy

38:02.179 --> 38:04.341
while the beer, the beer
is an afterthought.

38:08.686 --> 38:10.984
I have one glass of beer
a day and I savor it.

38:12.189 --> 38:13.657
And there it is on the ground.

38:16.560 --> 38:17.560
Lost.

38:29.440 --> 38:32.419
It's the effect we have on
the world that matters.

38:32.443 --> 38:34.775
Whether you're the
wine or the beer.

38:38.282 --> 38:40.114
And then to savor
what suits us best.

39:12.016 --> 39:13.327
- Hello.

39:13.351 --> 39:14.546
- Good morning, sunshine.

39:15.953 --> 39:18.665
- How did you get
my home number?

39:18.689 --> 39:20.214
And why are you calling me?

39:20.324 --> 39:23.692
Jesus, you know I'm an evening
edition woman, right?

39:23.794 --> 39:25.284
- Get your computer.

39:25.429 --> 39:26.590
- Bossy and rude.

39:30.167 --> 39:32.179
Wait, you wanna do a
video conference?

39:32.203 --> 39:33.203
- Just accept.

39:43.280 --> 39:44.658
- Why can't I see you?

39:44.682 --> 39:46.150
- That's not part of the deal.

39:47.351 --> 39:49.376
Post the next batch
of terms on the story

39:49.487 --> 39:51.683
printed the day after
Catherine went missing.

39:52.723 --> 39:55.702
- You didn't need to see
me to tell me that.

39:55.726 --> 39:58.718
- No, but to trust you I
need to be able to look you

39:58.829 --> 39:59.829
in the eye.

40:01.999 --> 40:04.297
- Does this mean I get the key?

40:06.871 --> 40:07.871
- The key to what?

40:08.839 --> 40:10.150
- To your apartment.

40:10.174 --> 40:11.505
To this matrix dummy.

40:13.377 --> 40:16.711
I've seen criminal organizations
use this method before.

40:16.814 --> 40:17.814
- All in good time.

40:18.883 --> 40:20.373
- You better hurry.

40:20.484 --> 40:23.697
The Chutro cartel is
scouring the earth for you.

40:23.721 --> 40:24.882
- Yeah, I expected that.

40:26.690 --> 40:27.690
- So what happens?

40:28.726 --> 40:30.203
Why did you turn?

40:30.227 --> 40:31.227
- I didn't turn.

40:32.730 --> 40:35.375
They killed a woman
who needed my help.

40:35.399 --> 40:37.993
We did the Amante job, split up.

40:39.270 --> 40:40.362
The next thing I hear,

40:44.041 --> 40:45.065
so I am responding.

40:46.710 --> 40:48.178
- I love a romantic.

40:49.680 --> 40:51.148
- Just get back to work.

41:04.462 --> 41:05.462
Who is it?

41:23.481 --> 41:25.245
I know why Anton and
Lance are here.

41:27.284 --> 41:28.376
What makes you special?

41:29.386 --> 41:31.855
- Sometimes a kill is a
matter of sleight of hand.

41:33.824 --> 41:36.803
- I don't follow.

41:36.827 --> 41:39.973
- I'm the distraction
while my partner

41:39.997 --> 41:40.997
finishes the job.

41:43.234 --> 41:47.364
- What does that make me?

41:48.672 --> 41:50.834
- Do you wanna find out?

42:06.156 --> 42:09.683
- I think you better leave.

42:50.367 --> 42:51.367
- Sheriff Dreyer.

42:52.803 --> 42:53.929
- Hello, Alice.

42:55.139 --> 42:56.139
- Bob, is that you?

42:57.141 --> 42:59.386
- I see that our calls
to your husband

42:59.410 --> 43:00.775
have been ineffective.

43:01.712 --> 43:02.712
- Who is this?

43:03.847 --> 43:05.474
- Alice, this is the Patron.

43:06.750 --> 43:10.209
I know you have
found Carson Empman

43:10.321 --> 43:12.983
and have seen the punishment
inflicted on him.

43:14.325 --> 43:17.158
So why have you not reported
anything to this effect?

43:18.028 --> 43:18.838
- I'm sorry but I...

43:18.862 --> 43:20.227
- You have one thing to do.

43:20.931 --> 43:25.391
Call Rachel Sovich at
the Associated Press,

43:25.502 --> 43:29.632
identify yourself and tell
her what you have found.

43:31.742 --> 43:33.267
You understand?

43:34.445 --> 43:36.106
- What will you do if I don't?

43:36.213 --> 43:40.226
- Alice, do not risk hell

43:40.250 --> 43:43.379
for a ghost.

44:03.140 --> 44:04.140
- What?

44:08.979 --> 44:09.979
Really?

44:10.914 --> 44:11.914
Where?

44:16.220 --> 44:17.517
No fucking way.

44:18.822 --> 44:19.983
Shoots through the ribs.

44:21.125 --> 44:24.151
- Very good.

44:25.896 --> 44:26.973
Okay Clarissa, you're up.

44:26.997 --> 44:28.795
- No, me next.

44:29.767 --> 44:30.767
Not yet convinced.

44:49.186 --> 44:50.186
. Okay-

44:52.756 --> 44:53.756
Good luck.

44:55.125 --> 44:56.125
- You'll need it.

44:58.595 --> 44:59.595
- Ready, gentlemen?

45:01.031 --> 45:02.031
- Ready.

45:08.439 --> 45:09.439
- Ready.

45:11.208 --> 45:12.369
- Okay then, go forward.

45:23.520 --> 45:24.520
- Anton.

45:28.492 --> 45:29.492
Anton!

45:33.797 --> 45:34.992
Anton, goddammit!

45:39.837 --> 45:41.430
- Just as I thought.

45:48.078 --> 45:49.078
- Thought what?

45:51.582 --> 45:52.582
- Asshole.

45:54.318 --> 45:55.444
- Right cheek, actually.

45:58.322 --> 45:59.132
- Good work.

45:59.156 --> 46:01.167
Lance, you are paralyzed.

46:01.191 --> 46:02.625
Okay, let's go get some lunch.

46:04.995 --> 46:05.995
- Wait.

46:12.069 --> 46:14.380
I think I finally figured
you out, Clarissa.

46:14.404 --> 46:15.599
- Lance, do not tell her.

46:17.941 --> 46:18.941
- You wanna be free.

46:21.278 --> 46:22.278
Confinement.

46:23.781 --> 46:24.781
That's your fear.

46:28.852 --> 46:30.650
I wouldn't touch a
hair on your head.

46:32.122 --> 46:34.887
We'd wrap you in carpet,
duct tape it tight

46:36.026 --> 46:38.571
and give you air and an IV,

46:38.595 --> 46:41.292
shove you in a box and
bury you underground.

46:41.398 --> 46:42.923
- Lance, enough!

46:45.803 --> 46:47.635
- You would try to
stay calm at first.

46:49.973 --> 46:52.908
Then you would panic and
fight to move even an inch.

46:55.379 --> 46:56.890
Then you would
pass out exhausted

46:56.914 --> 47:01.044
just to wake to the true
nightmare of no escape again

47:03.420 --> 47:07.789
and again and again.

47:07.891 --> 47:08.891
- I'll remember that.

47:23.407 --> 47:25.151
- Federal Bureau
of Investigation.

47:25.175 --> 47:26.836
Special Agent Sistek.

47:26.944 --> 47:28.254
- Bob, it's Alice.

47:28.278 --> 47:29.956
Both Paul and I have
received very disturbing

47:29.980 --> 47:32.458
death threats from
an anonymous caller.

47:32.482 --> 47:34.427
Is there anything you can
do to track down this guy?

47:34.451 --> 47:37.163
- Alice, it's about
time you contacted me.

47:37.187 --> 47:39.212
What the hell do you think
you're doing out there?

47:41.191 --> 47:42.001
- I don't know.

47:42.025 --> 47:44.170
- What's funny is
I got a call too.

47:44.194 --> 47:46.561
A source of mine says you
found a cartel hitman.

47:47.631 --> 47:50.157
The cartel hitman, is that true?

47:54.104 --> 47:56.937
- I don't know what I found.

48:04.348 --> 48:05.348
John?

48:06.149 --> 48:07.947
- Hey, sorry about before.

48:08.886 --> 48:11.253
Hearing the word Chutro
just makes me angry.

48:13.357 --> 48:14.500
- I know.

48:14.524 --> 48:15.524
And I'm sorry.

48:16.226 --> 48:18.092
- I checked up on
the hitman for you.

48:18.195 --> 48:21.062
This guy's plan was incredible.

48:21.164 --> 48:22.529
- What was he trying to do?

48:22.633 --> 48:24.677
- He was sharing the
financial information

48:24.701 --> 48:27.568
of the team that assassinated
that mayor Amante.

48:29.239 --> 48:31.117
Reporters have published
their names, bank accounts,

48:31.141 --> 48:32.852
routing numbers,
transaction IDs.

48:32.876 --> 48:34.674
But in unconnected pieces.

48:38.348 --> 48:39.659
- Did it work?

48:39.683 --> 48:41.481
- No, he didn't provide a key.

48:43.387 --> 48:44.252
- Key, what do you mean?

48:44.354 --> 48:46.379
- The key is how you
connect everything.

48:46.490 --> 48:50.236
It's how drug agents
communicate anonymously.

48:50.260 --> 48:51.955
Four random words
they search for

48:52.062 --> 48:54.690
that returns one page that
links it all together.

48:56.400 --> 48:58.596
- What would you use
to make the key?

48:58.702 --> 49:00.013
- I think he was using
the names of those

49:00.037 --> 49:00.914
in the hit squad.

49:00.938 --> 49:02.599
But he only published three.

49:02.706 --> 49:05.334
Empman, Vitoros and Delacroix.

49:06.410 --> 49:08.054
If someone could find
that fourth name,

49:08.078 --> 49:10.706
they might be able to
finish what he started.

49:10.847 --> 49:13.693
Just be careful, okay?

49:13.717 --> 49:15.261
- I Will.

49:15.285 --> 49:16.285
Thanks for your help.

49:21.224 --> 49:22.224
Four words.

49:50.153 --> 49:51.153
- Fuck him.

50:15.012 --> 50:16.012
- Who was the woman?

50:20.317 --> 50:21.341
- I was married once.

50:24.921 --> 50:26.548
- So you have a heart after all.

50:30.293 --> 50:33.285
- Not anymore.

50:38.635 --> 50:40.797
- I'm sorry, it's
none of my business.

50:48.478 --> 50:49.478
- Her name was Abby.

50:52.382 --> 50:53.872
We were out in the backcountry.

50:55.719 --> 50:57.744
Hunting, we've been drinking.

50:59.289 --> 51:00.289
I was drunk.

51:02.359 --> 51:03.359
My gun went off.

51:04.728 --> 51:06.059
Caught her right in the gut.

51:09.332 --> 51:10.629
I couldn't stop the bleeding.

51:13.403 --> 51:14.403
I left camp.

51:19.242 --> 51:21.609
By the time I got back,
it was too late.

51:24.848 --> 51:26.646
Her face all contorted
from the pain.

51:31.988 --> 51:32.988
What I wish is,

51:34.658 --> 51:36.069
I wish I would have
just gone back,

51:36.093 --> 51:38.790
snuck back in and put a bullet
in the back of her head.

51:40.497 --> 51:42.008
She never would have known

51:42.032 --> 51:43.659
and she never would
have suffered.

51:47.370 --> 51:49.395
Killing people quickly
is the closest thing

51:49.506 --> 51:51.531
to good I know how to do.

52:57.674 --> 52:58.674
Can I help you?

52:59.743 --> 53:02.121
- Yeah, you own this place?

53:02.145 --> 53:03.145
- My uncle does.

53:04.481 --> 53:05.992
- That's funny.

53:06.016 --> 53:07.126
We've been by here a few times

53:07.150 --> 53:10.163
and we've never seen anybody
check up on it before.

53:10.187 --> 53:11.187
- Well here I am.

53:13.924 --> 53:16.602
- So we don't think
you own this place.

53:16.626 --> 53:19.105
And we need it.

53:19.129 --> 53:20.324
We'd rather not kill you.

53:21.431 --> 53:22.909
Gunshots attract the
kind of attention

53:22.933 --> 53:24.196
that we don't need right now.

53:32.475 --> 53:33.953
Look.

53:33.977 --> 53:36.822
We just need a place to lay
low for a couple days.

53:36.846 --> 53:38.211
If it's all the same to you,

53:40.517 --> 53:41.637
how about that gun of yours?

54:12.048 --> 54:13.880
- John, you won't believe
what I figured out.

54:13.984 --> 54:15.661
- Mom, I looked
into this some more

54:15.685 --> 54:17.119
and you can be in some trouble.

54:17.220 --> 54:19.416
- He's not looking to
expose the hit squad.

54:19.522 --> 54:21.000
He's looking to
expose everything.

54:21.024 --> 54:23.236
- I need you to think
about your safety.

54:23.260 --> 54:24.670
They could be listening
to you right now!

54:24.694 --> 54:27.340
- Every kill he confessed to is
related to wine in some way.

54:27.364 --> 54:30.390
He's giving us a map to how
the entire system worked.

54:30.500 --> 54:34.347
Distributors, politicians,
even goddamn wine reviewers.

54:34.371 --> 54:35.381
' System?

54:35.405 --> 54:36.405
What system?

54:36.506 --> 54:40.653
- The Aguilamonte winery is
a gigantic money launderer.

54:40.677 --> 54:41.921
And through the other
contract killers,

54:41.945 --> 54:44.090
he's tying together the entire.

54:44.114 --> 54:46.082
Chutro financial organization.

54:46.182 --> 54:47.707
- Mom, stop.

54:49.452 --> 54:51.097
I need you to be quiet
and forget everything

54:51.121 --> 54:52.598
you just said.

54:52.622 --> 54:53.953
- John, this is huge, I,

54:54.057 --> 54:55.034
- Mom!

54:55.058 --> 54:56.168
Didn't you hear
about what happened

54:56.192 --> 54:59.059
to those newspaper reporters
that Empman was working with?

54:59.963 --> 55:00.963
- No, I didn't.

55:03.133 --> 55:05.329
- You don't know how
bad these people are.

55:13.043 --> 55:14.408
- Washington Herald.

55:15.612 --> 55:17.740
- Hey, Wendy Ludlow please.

55:20.050 --> 55:21.294
- Oh Jesus.

55:21.318 --> 55:22.561
- Ma'am is everything all right?

55:22.585 --> 55:24.883
- She's, Miss Ludlow is missing.

55:28.058 --> 55:29.268
- What are you talking about?

55:29.292 --> 55:31.659
- Are you the man she
was working with?

55:34.230 --> 55:35.230
- Where's Wendy?

55:36.633 --> 55:39.159
- They told me to read you this.

55:39.302 --> 55:41.828
Carson, give up if you
want to save her life.

55:43.239 --> 55:44.950
Or wait and have
both of you suffer.

55:44.974 --> 55:45.974
- Oh shit.

55:51.314 --> 55:52.975
- This is a police recording.

55:53.083 --> 55:54.060
If you have information

55:54.084 --> 55:55.928
on the whereabouts
of Mitch Verplank,

55:55.952 --> 55:57.477
please contact the Dallas F...

56:13.203 --> 56:14.034
- Sacramento 'Times.

56:14.137 --> 56:15.468
- Manuel Cortez please.

56:17.774 --> 56:19.652
- This is Special Agent Sistek.

56:19.676 --> 56:21.166
Who am I speaking with, please?

56:23.480 --> 56:26.643
- I need to speak with
Manuel Cortez now.

56:28.118 --> 56:31.630
- So, you must be Carson.

56:31.654 --> 56:33.850
Looks like the Patron
got ahead of your game.

56:35.325 --> 56:36.325
- Is he alive?

56:37.160 --> 56:38.491
- That's very hard to say.

56:39.396 --> 56:41.374
This newspaper received
a video this morning

56:41.398 --> 56:43.526
showing staff reporter
Manuel Cortez

56:43.633 --> 56:46.227
being wrapped in cowhide
and strung up over a fire.

56:47.203 --> 56:49.331
You spoke with this man
yesterday, correct?

56:52.208 --> 56:53.185
- Yes.

56:53.209 --> 56:54.387
- Well the video
continued to show.

56:54.411 --> 56:58.507
Mr. Cortez being roasted
alive for over three hours.

57:01.251 --> 57:05.882
I think it's about time
for you to help us out.

57:51.601 --> 57:52.841
- What are they doing with him?

57:54.037 --> 57:55.732
- It's one of our lab rats.

57:56.706 --> 57:58.401
- I thought the
serum was finished.

57:59.409 --> 58:01.173
- They want to get
the dosage light.

58:04.447 --> 58:05.447
- Who is he?

58:07.617 --> 58:09.462
- Someone who didn't
successfully curry

58:09.486 --> 58:11.147
the Patron's favor,
I would guess.

58:14.457 --> 58:16.323
Tell me about you and Clarissa.

58:21.631 --> 58:23.656
- Has your sixth sense
figured me out yet?

58:24.834 --> 58:27.462
- Not yet, but soon.

58:30.573 --> 58:32.268
Has Sergio given
you his pitch yet?

58:38.515 --> 58:40.040
- Pitch? No.

58:42.752 --> 58:44.049
- I imagine that you'll accept.

58:45.421 --> 58:48.434
You have a talent for
suffering I think

58:48.458 --> 58:50.256
that you've yet to appreciate.

58:52.762 --> 58:54.139
It was years ago, there
was a method I heard of

58:54.163 --> 58:55.790
that I thought was
quite brilliant.

58:57.367 --> 58:58.857
Takes just one bullet.

59:00.136 --> 59:02.400
You hit a precise
spot in the abdomen.

59:03.873 --> 59:05.841
Severs the intercostal nerve.

59:05.942 --> 59:07.786
It's excruciating pain,
a slow bleed out.

59:07.810 --> 59:11.576
But the mastery was
in the performance.

59:14.017 --> 59:15.507
You staged it as an accident.

59:18.821 --> 59:20.799
You told her you were
gonna go get help

59:20.823 --> 59:23.702
but you gave her hope so
that she would endure

59:23.726 --> 59:26.559
for as long as possible,
as long as her strength

59:26.663 --> 59:28.131
would hold out.

59:31.568 --> 59:33.400
Then you came back
at the last moment

59:35.038 --> 59:37.029
just to laugh at her
before she dies.

59:45.248 --> 59:47.046
Suffering is such a
complex emotion.

59:49.752 --> 59:51.618
There's so many shapes, colors.

59:53.923 --> 59:55.015
It's beautiful really.

59:58.995 --> 01:00:03.125
You should embrace
this talent of yours.

01:00:24.187 --> 01:00:25.898
- Office of the mayor.

01:00:25.922 --> 01:00:27.117
- Margaret Amante please.

01:00:28.391 --> 01:00:30.052
- May I ask who's calling?

01:00:32.362 --> 01:00:34.330
- I am the man who
murdered her husband.

01:00:35.398 --> 01:00:36.208
- It's him.

01:00:36.232 --> 01:00:37.097
- Connect me in 30 seconds.

01:00:37.200 --> 01:00:39.635
If she wants me caught,
I only speak to her.

01:00:46.776 --> 01:00:48.244
- She will speak to you.

01:00:48.378 --> 01:00:50.039
Call back in 15 minutes.

01:00:51.547 --> 01:00:52.571
- Exactly 15.

01:01:02.158 --> 01:01:04.183
- Your radios and
cellphones for tomorrow.

01:01:06.562 --> 01:01:07.562
All ready, my friends.

01:01:16.105 --> 01:01:17.630
Carson, please, sit.

01:01:22.845 --> 01:01:24.677
We have one more piece
of business to discuss.

01:01:27.016 --> 01:01:28.661
I have made an offer to
the rest of the team

01:01:28.685 --> 01:01:30.663
and they have all accepted.

01:01:30.687 --> 01:01:32.655
I'm about to make the
same offer to you.

01:01:34.457 --> 01:01:36.268
- Another job like this?

01:01:36.292 --> 01:01:37.292
I don't think so.

01:01:38.161 --> 01:01:40.528
- Not a job, my
friend, a career.

01:01:40.663 --> 01:01:42.188
Your contract rate
would increase

01:01:42.298 --> 01:01:44.892
to one million dollars
per assignment.

01:01:46.169 --> 01:01:47.500
Complete four jobs in a year

01:01:49.138 --> 01:01:50.858
and you receive a four
million dollar bonus.

01:01:52.108 --> 01:01:53.108
- What changes?

01:01:55.611 --> 01:01:56.611
- A certain degree of.

01:01:59.215 --> 01:02:00.215
- Torture?

01:02:02.819 --> 01:02:03.819
- Penance.

01:02:05.388 --> 01:02:06.932
That was the word that
I was looking for.

01:02:06.956 --> 01:02:07.833
And don't worry, my friend.

01:02:07.857 --> 01:02:10.121
We can offer you all
the training you need.

01:02:11.994 --> 01:02:13.655
We need good men
like you, Carson.

01:02:14.797 --> 01:02:15.941
Consider it.

01:02:15.965 --> 01:02:18.777
- Do not miss out on this
opportunity, Carson.

01:02:18.801 --> 01:02:20.462
The Patron would
be most grateful.

01:02:21.804 --> 01:02:23.272
- You get to be my understudy.

01:02:24.841 --> 01:02:26.318
- I don't torture people.

01:02:26.342 --> 01:02:28.106
- You'd learn to like it.

01:02:32.081 --> 01:02:33.571
- You still don't know, do you?

01:02:34.884 --> 01:02:36.374
- Oh I think I'm getting close.

01:02:37.520 --> 01:02:39.632
- How about I just tell you?

01:02:39.655 --> 01:02:41.282
I'd hate for you
to get it wrong.

01:02:45.394 --> 01:02:49.490
Take me somewhere remote
where I may never be found.

01:02:51.200 --> 01:02:55.180
Slice off my fingertips,
peel the skin

01:02:55.204 --> 01:02:57.082
off of my tattoos.

01:02:57.106 --> 01:03:00.252
Pour acid on my face,
burning out my eyes.

01:03:00.276 --> 01:03:02.973
Leave me completely
unrecognizable.

01:03:04.781 --> 01:03:08.240
Then rip out my teeth
and tear out my tongue

01:03:09.252 --> 01:03:13.732
and as I died, I know that
even when I was found

01:03:13.756 --> 01:03:16.068
they would never know who I was.

01:03:16.092 --> 01:03:18.356
I would leave no legacy

01:03:19.695 --> 01:03:23.825
except my own excruciating hell.

01:03:33.209 --> 01:03:36.668
- Strange how someone
that prizes anonymity

01:03:36.779 --> 01:03:38.611
would fear that of all things.

01:03:42.385 --> 01:03:43.385
- Yes.

01:03:45.121 --> 01:03:46.121
Strange.

01:03:52.395 --> 01:03:53.395
I'll think about it.

01:04:05.975 --> 01:04:08.444
I am beginning to believe
that I will not succeed.

01:04:10.313 --> 01:04:11.757
Whoever you are, share this
letter with the world.

01:04:11.781 --> 01:04:13.258
Whoever you are, share this
letter with the world.

01:04:13.282 --> 01:04:14.374
They will want to know.

01:04:15.351 --> 01:04:17.479
Just put the following
words in sequence

01:04:17.587 --> 01:04:18.587
in whatever you say.

01:04:19.755 --> 01:04:22.952
Do that and the
cartel will fall.

01:04:26.596 --> 01:04:28.030
- Who is Clarissa, Carson?

01:04:34.337 --> 01:04:35.827
- Hello, Alice.

01:04:38.608 --> 01:04:39.608
- Hello, Patron.

01:04:40.610 --> 01:04:43.238
- You have not made the call to Mrs.
Sovich.

01:04:46.015 --> 01:04:47.346
- No.

01:04:47.450 --> 01:04:50.078
- Why you make such a mistake?

01:04:50.987 --> 01:04:52.751
- Because you want
the world to know

01:04:52.855 --> 01:04:55.984
what you'll do to anyone
who gets in your way.

01:04:57.727 --> 01:05:01.254
- Alice, I know how hard it was

01:05:01.364 --> 01:05:05.358
for you to see your son
in prison three years.

01:05:07.637 --> 01:05:11.005
But he knew that
whatever he faced inside

01:05:12.375 --> 01:05:16.505
was nothing compared to
the price of betrayal.

01:05:18.848 --> 01:05:22.661
Do you wish for him to
suffer now because of you?

01:05:22.685 --> 01:05:24.847
- Okay Patron, I understand.

01:05:26.055 --> 01:05:27.216
I understand completely.

01:05:28.891 --> 01:05:30.381
I'll call Sovich right now.

01:05:30.493 --> 01:05:32.537
- Because we can take him

01:05:32.561 --> 01:05:36.074
from his garage in Olympia
whenever we want.

01:05:36.098 --> 01:05:36.894
Do you understand?

01:05:36.999 --> 01:05:39.978
- Yes, goddammit, I understand.

01:05:40.002 --> 01:05:43.961
- Don't make me come for you.

01:06:02.925 --> 01:06:04.689
- They won't turn
me into a monster.

01:06:07.630 --> 01:06:09.120
- That's why they
brought you here.

01:06:14.904 --> 01:06:15.904
Well what now?

01:06:18.975 --> 01:06:20.272
- I'll do the job and disappear.

01:06:20.376 --> 01:06:21.376
- They'll find you.

01:06:24.780 --> 01:06:25.780
Let's leave.

01:06:27.917 --> 01:06:30.228
Now.

01:06:30.252 --> 01:06:31.845
I wanna be done with the cartel.

01:06:47.169 --> 01:06:48.169
- Good luck tomorrow.

01:06:56.012 --> 01:06:59.949
- Goddamn you.

01:07:26.342 --> 01:07:27.867
- Is this a prank?

01:07:28.010 --> 01:07:29.535
- Hello, Margaret, no it is not.

01:07:30.846 --> 01:07:32.473
- Then why are you calling me?

01:07:34.016 --> 01:07:35.541
- To give you vengeance.

01:07:35.651 --> 01:07:37.129
- I don't,

01:07:37.153 --> 01:07:38.279
I don't want vengeance.

01:07:39.955 --> 01:07:41.320
- I am sorry but I need you.

01:07:43.125 --> 01:07:45.670
I had four reporters that
were gonna do your job.

01:07:45.694 --> 01:07:47.560
- Do you know what is
happening to them?

01:07:47.663 --> 01:07:50.008
They are being tortured every
day until you are found.

01:07:50.032 --> 01:07:51.543
- Yes.

01:07:51.567 --> 01:07:52.567
Yes I do.

01:07:53.502 --> 01:07:54.502
And we can help them.

01:07:56.038 --> 01:07:57.062
- Tell me how.

01:08:03.312 --> 01:08:05.007
- Alice, what you got for me?

01:08:06.549 --> 01:08:08.560
- They're threatening my son.

01:08:08.584 --> 01:08:11.229
I need you to send someone to
his garage to protect him.

01:08:11.253 --> 01:08:12.948
- Try and calm down.

01:08:13.055 --> 01:08:14.250
Who's threatening him?

01:08:14.356 --> 01:08:16.051
- The Chutro drug cartel.

01:08:17.326 --> 01:08:18.703
- All right, listen
carefully, Alice.

01:08:18.727 --> 01:08:20.906
If you want this job
in San Francisco,

01:08:20.930 --> 01:08:24.298
you hang up and do what
they asked you to do.

01:08:24.399 --> 01:08:26.243
- I am begging you Bob, please.

01:08:26.268 --> 01:08:27.736
Protect my son.

01:08:27.837 --> 01:08:29.981
- All right, we have
men on the way.

01:08:30.005 --> 01:08:31.850
- To watch my son?

01:08:31.874 --> 01:08:33.417
- To you, Alice.

01:08:33.442 --> 01:08:35.376
Now do what the Patron asks.

01:08:44.019 --> 01:08:45.316
- Associated Press.

01:08:45.421 --> 01:08:46.752
- Rachel Sovich please.

01:08:48.390 --> 01:08:50.381
- If I do nothing,
you're dead anyway.

01:08:51.627 --> 01:08:52.992
What could I
possibly give to you

01:08:53.095 --> 01:08:54.220
that is in my interest?

01:08:56.031 --> 01:08:57.676
- A public announcement.

01:08:57.700 --> 01:08:59.277
- Go on.

01:08:59.301 --> 01:09:01.429
- I want to destroy Chutro.

01:09:03.104 --> 01:09:04.470
But to do that I need a war

01:09:05.407 --> 01:09:07.752
between all the cartels.

01:09:07.776 --> 01:09:10.301
If they all have access
to the same information

01:09:10.412 --> 01:09:13.279
at the same time, they will
all go after Chutro at once.

01:09:13.381 --> 01:09:15.578
Anything short of that
means nothing will happen.

01:09:16.785 --> 01:09:18.310
- What do you need me to do?

01:09:23.125 --> 01:09:26.459
- You will announce that the
man who murdered your husband

01:09:26.562 --> 01:09:28.273
is giving himself up.

01:09:28.296 --> 01:09:29.296
- He is?

01:09:30.232 --> 01:09:33.278
- Schedule a press conference,
get on the five o'clock news,

01:09:33.301 --> 01:09:34.813
put the microphone
up to the speaker

01:09:34.837 --> 01:09:36.305
and I will give everything up.

01:09:37.840 --> 01:09:38.863
- Five p.m. tonight.

01:09:38.974 --> 01:09:39.974
Pacific time.

01:09:40.943 --> 01:09:41.943
Call me then.

01:09:44.145 --> 01:09:45.170
- Thank you, Margaret.

01:09:46.916 --> 01:09:49.060
- I've been anxiously
awaiting your call,

01:09:49.084 --> 01:09:50.261
Sheriff Dreyer.

01:09:50.286 --> 01:09:53.598
This will be headline news
across the country tomorrow.

01:09:53.622 --> 01:09:55.500
You are going to be famous.

01:09:55.524 --> 01:09:57.515
- Are you working
with him, the Patron?

01:09:57.626 --> 01:09:59.651
- I'm just doing
my job, Sheriff.

01:09:59.762 --> 01:10:02.974
So I hear you have some
gory details for me.

01:10:02.998 --> 01:10:04.261
Tell me about the body.

01:10:06.035 --> 01:10:08.129
- Got what appears
to be a homicide.

01:10:09.038 --> 01:10:11.735
Male victim,
deceased a few days.

01:10:14.677 --> 01:10:18.807
Fingertips, patches of skin and
the scalp have been removed.

01:10:20.616 --> 01:10:24.696
Face, teeth, tongue removed.

01:10:24.720 --> 01:10:26.586
- Now I have sources
that indicate

01:10:26.689 --> 01:10:28.867
a letter was found?

01:10:28.891 --> 01:10:31.019
- You are working with
them, you little shit.

01:10:31.126 --> 01:10:33.104
Yes, I found a letter.

01:10:33.128 --> 01:10:35.674
- So, did he really
suffer all that

01:10:35.698 --> 01:10:36.790
just for a woman?

01:10:50.546 --> 01:10:51.546
- The woman.

01:10:56.685 --> 01:10:58.163
John, don't hang up.

01:10:58.187 --> 01:11:01.233
The hit on Amante, there
was a woman on the team.

01:11:01.257 --> 01:11:02.067
Who was she?

01:11:02.091 --> 01:11:03.752
- Mom, no one knows.

01:11:03.859 --> 01:11:05.036
- This was a big target.

01:11:05.060 --> 01:11:06.705
They would have used
their best people.

01:11:06.729 --> 01:11:08.707
Any idea who she could be?

01:11:08.731 --> 01:11:10.927
- The cartel hires dozens
of contract killers,

01:11:11.033 --> 01:11:12.210
men and women.

01:11:12.234 --> 01:11:14.066
- Anyone named Clarissa?

01:11:35.224 --> 01:11:36.589
- So you agreed to the deal?

01:11:38.360 --> 01:11:40.905
- Never had much of a
choice now, did we?

01:11:40.929 --> 01:11:42.124
- You could have said no.

01:11:44.066 --> 01:11:45.866
- I don't know what kind
of life you've lived,

01:11:47.036 --> 01:11:50.515
but all my choices have been
either to live a nightmare

01:11:50.539 --> 01:11:51.836
or be the nightmare.

01:11:54.043 --> 01:11:56.535
Either way, the nightmare
just keeps getting worse.

01:11:58.113 --> 01:12:00.081
But shit, it don't
even matter then now.

01:12:02.117 --> 01:12:03.194
Probably won't live long enough

01:12:03.218 --> 01:12:04.310
for it to be an issue.

01:12:05.287 --> 01:12:06.311
- What does that mean?

01:12:08.290 --> 01:12:10.657
- I mean you and Clarissa.

01:12:12.961 --> 01:12:14.806
Man, how could you be so stupid?

01:12:14.830 --> 01:12:15.830
- That is over.

01:12:16.565 --> 01:12:17.542
We're through.

01:12:17.566 --> 01:12:18.566
- We're a team, man.

01:12:20.069 --> 01:12:21.069
We're family.

01:12:22.004 --> 01:12:24.632
We succeed together,
we betray together.

01:12:24.740 --> 01:12:25.740
- Betray?

01:12:26.442 --> 01:12:27.534
Who did I betray?

01:12:29.411 --> 01:12:32.557
- Well at least Clarissa would
suffer just as bad, huh?

01:12:32.581 --> 01:12:33.581
Or maybe even worse.

01:12:34.583 --> 01:12:35.760
What, I guess you're
just gonna hope

01:12:35.784 --> 01:12:36.979
she keeps her mouth shut?

01:12:38.520 --> 01:12:40.716
- Anton, what the fuck
are you talking about?

01:12:48.030 --> 01:12:49.030
- Your little affair

01:12:50.132 --> 01:12:53.397
was with Clarissa
Annabelle Chutro.

01:12:55.104 --> 01:12:56.697
She's the new Patron's wife.

01:13:09.685 --> 01:13:10.880
- Perhaps I had it wrong.

01:13:12.354 --> 01:13:14.550
Perhaps I'm writing to
someone else entirely.

01:13:16.158 --> 01:13:17.535
Maybe the person
holding this letter

01:13:17.559 --> 01:13:19.049
is the one sent to torture me.

01:13:21.196 --> 01:13:22.357
Maybe you were too late.

01:13:23.832 --> 01:13:26.878
Together with Margaret Amante
we will show the world

01:13:26.902 --> 01:13:29.234
how to take down
Chutro and the Patron.

01:13:31.173 --> 01:13:33.198
And my penance will be complete.

01:13:53.429 --> 01:13:54.590
- John, one more thing.

01:13:54.730 --> 01:13:56.741
- No mom, stop trying
to figure this out.

01:13:56.765 --> 01:13:57.596
Just let it be.

01:13:57.699 --> 01:13:59.565
- There was going to
be a press conference

01:13:59.668 --> 01:14:01.346
and Empman was calling in.

01:14:01.370 --> 01:14:03.515
Amante's wife Margaret
was putting it on.

01:14:03.539 --> 01:14:05.550
- No, there wasn't.

01:14:05.574 --> 01:14:07.419
- Empman was going to
admit to everything.

01:14:07.443 --> 01:14:09.138
Why was it cancelled?

01:14:09.244 --> 01:14:12.257
- Mom, there never was gonna
be a press conference.

01:14:12.281 --> 01:14:14.215
She set that up to
track his cellphone.

01:14:15.451 --> 01:14:16.475
Looked like it worked.

01:14:37.873 --> 01:14:38.873
- Yeah.

01:14:44.379 --> 01:14:45.379
On it.

01:14:48.484 --> 01:14:49.849
You are welcome at any time.

01:15:04.099 --> 01:15:05.076
- I'm just saying I
think that we could try

01:15:05.100 --> 01:15:06.744
and reschedule the one meeting.

01:15:06.768 --> 01:15:07.946
- Well, can we just,

01:15:07.970 --> 01:15:09.547
for this one can we
just keep the questions

01:15:09.571 --> 01:15:11.049
to half an hour?

01:15:11.073 --> 01:15:12.817
- You're declaring
that you will end

01:15:12.841 --> 01:15:15.139
bribery and corruption
in the city.

01:15:15.244 --> 01:15:17.322
There are going to be
a lot of questions.

01:15:17.346 --> 01:15:19.644
- I'm just really nervous.

01:15:19.748 --> 01:15:20.959
- Well, you're gonna piss off

01:15:20.983 --> 01:15:23.247
some very dangerous people.

01:15:26.421 --> 01:15:27.946
- Excuse me sir, may I help you?

01:15:29.758 --> 01:15:31.055
- He's coming down the steps.

01:15:31.159 --> 01:15:31.990
20 seconds.

01:15:32.094 --> 01:15:33.905
- I need that script.

01:15:33.929 --> 01:15:36.398
If I say too little,
this thing can blow up.

01:15:36.498 --> 01:15:38.109
And if I say too much
of the wrong thing,

01:15:38.133 --> 01:15:39.294
I can go to prison.

01:15:40.269 --> 01:15:41.269
- Or worse.

01:16:30.652 --> 01:16:32.518
- Sweety, you will be fine.

01:16:36.158 --> 01:16:37.969
Short concise answers.

01:16:37.993 --> 01:16:39.871
- 10 seconds, keep going.

01:16:39.895 --> 01:16:41.706
- Sir, you're going
to have to leave.

01:16:41.730 --> 01:16:45.394
- Don't over-explain.

01:16:46.335 --> 01:16:47.745
- Five seconds, get ready.

01:16:47.769 --> 01:16:50.136
- This is my last warning!

01:16:50.238 --> 01:16:52.229
- Just try and stick
to the talking points

01:16:52.341 --> 01:16:53.341
that we discussed.

01:16:54.710 --> 01:16:55.853
- Do it now.

01:16:55.877 --> 01:16:57.572
Do it now, make a count.

01:16:57.679 --> 01:16:59.807
- That's it, out!

01:17:01.083 --> 01:17:04.109
- Excuse me.

01:17:04.219 --> 01:17:05.219
- What is she doing?

01:17:06.021 --> 01:17:07.932
- Just let the staff handle it.

01:17:07.956 --> 01:17:09.151
- That's the problem.

01:17:09.257 --> 01:17:10.602
We can't have headlines of a,

01:17:10.626 --> 01:17:14.290
of a beating on,

01:17:14.396 --> 01:17:15.727
- Morgan, are you all right?

01:17:17.299 --> 01:17:18.299
- He's all yours.

01:18:19.928 --> 01:18:20.928
- Hello, Carson.

01:18:23.765 --> 01:18:24.809
- It hurts.

01:18:24.833 --> 01:18:25.833
- Morgan?

01:18:26.668 --> 01:18:28.146
Somebody help me.

01:18:28.170 --> 01:18:29.035
- I'm a Doctor, what's wrong?

01:18:29.137 --> 01:18:30.571
- Stop right there.

01:18:30.672 --> 01:18:32.483
- Look, I'm from St. Michaels.

01:18:32.507 --> 01:18:33.518
Now please let me through.

01:18:33.542 --> 01:18:34.839
And somebody call 911.

01:18:34.943 --> 01:18:38.902
- Let him through.

01:18:42.451 --> 01:18:44.529
- Is he gonna be all right?

01:18:44.553 --> 01:18:45.384
- I don't know, dammit.

01:18:45.487 --> 01:18:46.784
It could be an obstruction.

01:18:48.824 --> 01:18:51.418
The Patron says, hello, Mayor.

01:18:52.828 --> 01:18:55.354
And he thanks you
for your betrayal.

01:18:58.066 --> 01:19:00.091
And in return, your
family will now watch

01:19:00.202 --> 01:19:04.332
as you suffer the
most exquisite death.

01:19:07.476 --> 01:19:09.604
Welcome to hell.

01:19:17.652 --> 01:19:20.231
- Carson, my amigo.

01:19:20.255 --> 01:19:21.255
- Hello, Patron.

01:19:24.993 --> 01:19:26.290
They told me you were dead.

01:19:27.529 --> 01:19:28.724
That you'd been tortured.

01:19:31.032 --> 01:19:32.295
- Yeah, that was my doing.

01:19:36.738 --> 01:19:38.916
I let the Patron believe
that you loved me

01:19:38.940 --> 01:19:39.964
so he wanted you dead.

01:19:41.443 --> 01:19:44.105
So I convinced him to let me
set the trap with Sergio.

01:19:45.247 --> 01:19:46.578
- So you wanted me dead.

01:19:47.749 --> 01:19:48.910
- I hadn't decided yet.

01:19:52.354 --> 01:19:53.617
- What are you doing here?

01:20:01.096 --> 01:20:02.120
- I'm the distraction.

01:20:23.485 --> 01:20:25.510
- I've waited a long
time for this, Carson.

01:20:31.326 --> 01:20:34.660
- As you now realize,
this was all for you.

01:20:35.897 --> 01:20:40.044
You now are a monster like us.

01:20:40.068 --> 01:20:42.765
I will call on you
again soon, compadre.

01:20:47.075 --> 01:20:48.653
- You've been injected
with a paralytic serum

01:20:48.677 --> 01:20:51.169
with a careful dose of acid.

01:20:51.279 --> 01:20:53.658
And you shall die in
the next eight hours.

01:20:53.682 --> 01:20:54.682
But do not worry.

01:20:55.684 --> 01:20:57.152
We found a replacement for you.

01:20:57.252 --> 01:21:01.120
Someone to keep things
just the way they were.

01:21:04.626 --> 01:21:05.991
That should stabilize him.

01:21:06.094 --> 01:21:07.687
And where's that damn ambulance?

01:21:33.955 --> 01:21:36.617
- You were so
close, weren't you?

01:21:59.214 --> 01:22:00.214
You ready?

01:22:05.387 --> 01:22:06.877
- Congratulations, Alice.

01:22:08.156 --> 01:22:09.867
You completed your
fist assignment.

01:22:09.891 --> 01:22:11.402
You just let the world
know what happens

01:22:11.426 --> 01:22:13.019
when you try to
cross the Patron.

01:22:15.196 --> 01:22:16.841
And for a moment I think
you had it in you

01:22:16.865 --> 01:22:17.865
to follow orders.

01:22:19.434 --> 01:22:20.912
- So was that enough for you?

01:22:20.936 --> 01:22:22.079
<i>'</i> Yes.

01:22:22.103 --> 01:22:24.037
Thanks Alice,
you've done enough.

01:22:25.607 --> 01:22:27.184
I look forward to having
you down here on the team.

01:22:27.208 --> 01:22:28.208
- Go to hell.

01:22:38.853 --> 01:22:40.116
- Clarissa, step aside.

01:22:51.366 --> 01:22:53.164
- Does this scare you, Lance?

01:22:54.736 --> 01:22:58.604
- And why would it?

01:22:58.707 --> 01:23:02.837
- Because this sure as
hell isn't my worst fear.

01:23:14.089 --> 01:23:15.614
- Your turn, Lance.

01:23:25.767 --> 01:23:27.963
- If you are reading
this then I'm dead.

01:23:29.437 --> 01:23:31.098
You must finish
what I've started.

01:23:32.474 --> 01:23:33.964
With the information
provided here

01:23:34.109 --> 01:23:37.477
you now possess the map to
seven hundred million dollars

01:23:37.579 --> 01:23:39.673
of the Chutro cartel's assets.

01:23:41.916 --> 01:23:44.428
Use it to destroy them.

01:23:44.452 --> 01:23:45.715
Do whatever is necessary.

01:23:47.422 --> 01:23:48.422
I'm counting on you.

01:23:50.025 --> 01:23:54.053
If you fail me, then
know even in my death

01:23:54.162 --> 01:23:56.631
that a ghost will
soon pay you a visit.

01:24:00.635 --> 01:24:01.913
- Sheriff Dreyer.

01:24:01.936 --> 01:24:04.782
- Alice, you were just in time.

01:24:04.806 --> 01:24:06.484
- Will my son be left alone?

01:24:06.508 --> 01:24:08.340
- Well, for now.

01:24:08.443 --> 01:24:10.309
But we will keep an eye on him.

01:24:11.513 --> 01:24:15.643
Now I wonder why you took
such risks for a dead man.

01:24:17.719 --> 01:24:19.585
Perhaps you will
tell me when you are

01:24:19.687 --> 01:24:20.779
in San Francisco.

01:24:21.689 --> 01:24:23.282
- Perhaps not.

01:24:23.391 --> 01:24:24.881
I might not have what it takes.

01:24:26.161 --> 01:24:30.541
- Then until we meet
again, Sheriff Dreyer.

01:24:30.565 --> 01:24:31.565
- Patron.
