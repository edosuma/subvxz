WEBVTT

00:07.678 --> 00:09.279
"MELISSA & JOEY" IS RECORDED IN
FRONT OF A LIVE STUDIO AUDIENCE.

00:09.280 --> 00:11.541
IT'S A NO-GO, THERESA!

00:11.542 --> 00:15.014
YEAH, LOOK, I LOVE NONA AS WELL.
SHE'S MY GRANDMOTHER TOO!

00:15.015 --> 00:17.118
LOOK, IF THERE WAS A WAY I
COULD DO IT, I'D DO IT!

00:18.119 --> 00:20.250
YEAH, YOU TOO!

00:20.251 --> 00:23.323
JEEZ, WHY ARE YOU SO
MAD AT YOUR SISTER?

00:23.324 --> 00:25.795
I'M NOT MAD AT HER. THAT'S
NEW JERSEY FOR "I LOVE YOU."

00:25.796 --> 00:28.628
WOW, SO HOW DO YOU TELL
IF SOMEONE IS ANGRY?

00:28.629 --> 00:30.660
THE POLICE SHOW UP.

00:30.661 --> 00:32.302
I AM UPSET THOUGH.

00:32.303 --> 00:36.035
MY GRANDMOTHER SOFIA IS FAILING.

00:36.036 --> 00:38.668
NEXT WEEK IS HER BIRTHDAY AND IT'S
PROBABLY GOING TO BE HER LAST.

00:38.669 --> 00:41.811
AND ALL SHE WANTS IS TO SEE
ME AND TIFFANY TOGETHER

00:41.812 --> 00:44.774
- ONE FINAL TIME.
- WHY DOES SHE WANT TO SEE YOUR EX-WIFE?

00:44.775 --> 00:47.578
I KINDA NEVER TOLD HER
THAT WE GOT DIVORCED.

00:48.779 --> 00:51.621
- SO YOU LIED TO HER.
- HEY, I WAS PROTECTING HER!

00:51.622 --> 00:53.423
WHY CAN'T YOU PEOPLE SEE THAT?!

00:53.424 --> 00:57.557
JOE, WE'RE SIMPLE OHIO PEOPLE.
NO YELLING IS REQUIRED.

00:57.558 --> 01:01.261
I'M SORRY, I'M SORRY. ONCE I LET THE JERSEY
OUT, IT'S VERY HARD TO WALK IT BACK.

01:01.262 --> 01:03.463
- JOE, HAVE SOME GUAVA JUICE.
- THANK YOU, MAN, THANK YOU.

01:03.464 --> 01:07.237
SO WHEN YOU GO BACK THERE TO SEE
HER, WHAT'RE YOU GOING TO SAY?

01:07.238 --> 01:10.400
"HAPPY 99th BIRTHDAY, NONA.
I'M DIVORCED."

01:10.401 --> 01:13.643
I MIGHT AS WELL JUST PLUNGE A KNIFE
INTO HER CONGESTED OLD HEART.

01:13.644 --> 01:16.576
HEY, WHY DON'T YOU JUST ASK
TIFFANY TO GO WITH YOU

01:16.577 --> 01:18.778
SO YOU CAN PRETEND YOU'RE
MARRIED FOR A COUPLE HOURS?

01:18.779 --> 01:23.153
THAT IS THE STUPIDEST IDEA I EVER
HEARD AND I ALREADY TRIED THAT.

01:23.154 --> 01:25.255
WANT TO KNOW WHAT'S
FUNNY THOUGH?

01:25.256 --> 01:27.517
I-I DON'T REALLY WANT TO
ASK ANY MORE QUESTIONS.

01:27.518 --> 01:30.220
MY NONA'S EYESIGHT'S SO BAD SHE
PROBABLY WOULDN'T KNOW THE DIFFERENCE

01:30.221 --> 01:33.693
BETWEEN TIFFANY AND A WALL. I MEAN, YOU
KNOW, IF THE WALL WAS, LIKE, STACKED

01:33.694 --> 01:37.667
AND WORE A LEOPARD-PRINT SKIRT AND
A LOT OF MAKE-UP. ( chuckles )

01:37.668 --> 01:40.170
HONESTLY, ANY BLONDE LIKE
THAT WOULD PROBABLY DO.

01:40.171 --> 01:42.772
HELLO, PEOPLE OF MY KITCHEN!

01:42.773 --> 01:47.607
I WAS SHOE SHOPPING. CHECK OUT
THE LATEST IN STILETTO HEELS.

01:47.608 --> 01:50.110
NOW BE HONEST, EVERYONE. DO
THESE MAKE ME LOOK TOO TRASHY?

01:53.644 --> 01:55.546
I'D SAY JUST TRASHY ENOUGH.

01:57.648 --> 01:58.888

OUT OF YOUR LIFE!

02:20.741 --> 02:21.712
EVERYONE ELSE'LL KNOW THE TRUTH.

02:21.713 --> 02:23.213
ALL YOU'LL HAVE TO FOOL
IS MY GRANDMOTHER.

02:23.214 --> 02:24.814
THE WHOLE IDEA IS RIDICULOUS!

02:24.815 --> 02:26.646
NOBODY WOULD BELIEVE
ME AS TIFFANY.

02:26.647 --> 02:28.548
I'M WAY TOO CLASSY!

02:28.549 --> 02:30.750
IT'S A DYING WOMAN'S
LAST REQUEST!

02:30.751 --> 02:32.151
DON'T GUILT TRIP ME.

02:32.152 --> 02:33.723
AND WHAT ARE YOU GETTING
SO MAD ABOUT ANYWAY?

02:33.724 --> 02:36.456
WHAT? THIS IS A CONVERSATIONAL
TONE IN NEW JERSEY.

02:36.457 --> 02:39.259
COME ON, AUNT MEL, ALL
FOUR OF US CAN GO.

02:39.260 --> 02:41.391
IT'LL BE LIKE CULTURAL
ANTHROPOLOGY...

02:41.392 --> 02:44.664
YOU KNOW, OBSERVE THE LONGOS
IN THEIR NATURAL HABITAT.

02:44.665 --> 02:47.537
- DON'T YOU HAVE PROM?
- I DECIDED NOT TO GO.

02:47.538 --> 02:50.940
ZANDER AND I ARE IN A PRE-COLLEGE
SEPARATION. IT'S A PAUSE.

02:50.941 --> 02:53.773
AND NO, I DON'T WANT
TO TALK ABOUT IT.

02:53.774 --> 02:55.345
A TRIP TO JERSEY? I'M IN.

02:55.346 --> 02:57.277
BOY, DO I NEED TO GET
OUT OF THIS HOUSE.

02:57.278 --> 02:58.678
WHAT'S WRONG WITH THIS HOUSE?

02:58.679 --> 03:01.311
HOME SCHOOLING IS NOT
THE AMUSEMENT-PARK RIDE

03:01.312 --> 03:03.913
IT'S CRACKED UP TO BE. YOU KNOW
HOW MANY TILES ARE ON THAT WALL?

03:03.914 --> 03:05.915
4,076.

03:05.916 --> 03:08.458
G'HEAD, COUNT 'EM.

03:08.459 --> 03:09.719
YOU KNOW WHAT, GUYS?

03:09.720 --> 03:12.362
I APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT
YOU'D BE WILLING TO GO.

03:12.363 --> 03:14.624
IT SHOWS REALLY REALLY
GREAT CHARACTER.

03:14.625 --> 03:18.197
BUT UNFORTUNATELY WITHOUT TIFFANY
THE WHOLE TRIP IS A LOST CAUSE.

03:18.198 --> 03:21.200
LET ME SAY IT TO YOU IN
JERSEY: I AIN'T GOIN'!

03:21.201 --> 03:22.902
ALL RIGHT, LOOK, I'VE
MET YOUR EX-WIFE.

03:22.903 --> 03:25.275
I JUST DON'T SEE MYSELF BEING
ABLE TO PULL THAT OFF.

03:25.276 --> 03:26.976
THAT WHOLE LITTLE GIRL ACT?
IT'S NOT ME.

03:26.977 --> 03:29.479
ALL RIGHT, FINE. GUESS
I WAS ASKING TOO MUCH.

03:29.480 --> 03:32.282
I'LL JUST MAKE THE TRIP MYSELF
AND I'LL TELL HER I'M DIVORCED

03:32.283 --> 03:34.484
AND SHE'LL JUST HAVE
TO LIVE WITH IT.

03:34.485 --> 03:37.318
OR I GUESS... DIE WITH IT.

03:40.991 --> 03:42.522
ALL RIGHT, LOOK,
I KNOW YOU THINK

03:42.523 --> 03:43.924
I'M BEING SELFISH,
BUT YOU'RE WRONG.

03:45.626 --> 03:48.629
WHO WANTS TO SEE THE OTHER SHOES I BOUGHT?
( squeals )

03:49.530 --> 03:51.831
( loudly ) YES YES, NONA!

03:51.832 --> 03:53.933
IT'S JOEY.

03:53.934 --> 03:55.735
YEAH, ABSOLUTELY.

03:55.736 --> 03:58.769
I'M GONNA BE THERE SATURDAY.
I WOULDN'T MISS IT.

03:59.770 --> 04:01.941
N... NO NO.

04:01.942 --> 04:04.614
TIFFANY'S NOT GONNA
BE ABLE TO MAKE IT.

04:04.615 --> 04:06.676
NO NO... NO NO,
HEY HEY, DON'T...

04:06.677 --> 04:10.480
DON'T... DON'T CRY, NONA. NO NO,
IT'S REALLY NOT GOOD FOR YOUR HEART.

04:10.481 --> 04:12.622
IT'S JUST... NO!

04:12.623 --> 04:14.824
NO, MY WIFE LOVES YOU.
( laughs )

04:14.825 --> 04:17.887
MORE THAN SHE LOVES ME, I
CAN SAY THAT HONESTLY.

04:17.888 --> 04:20.630
- IT'S JUST THAT... NO, HEY!
- WHAT IS THAT BOY TELLING YOU?

04:20.631 --> 04:24.494
OF COURSE I'M COMING, NONA! NO,
JOEJOEBEE IS JUST BEING A SILLY WILLY.

04:24.495 --> 04:27.337
BUT I LOVE HIM OODLES
AND OODLES AND OODLES.

04:27.338 --> 04:28.998
I'LL SEE YOU SATURDAY.
MWAH MWAH MWAH!

04:28.999 --> 04:30.700
- ( beeps )
- HOW WAS THAT?

04:30.701 --> 04:33.873
PRETTY MUCH DEAD ON.

04:33.874 --> 04:35.875
ARE YOU REALLY GONNA
DO THIS FOR ME?

04:35.876 --> 04:38.578
( sighs ) YEAH, I CAN'T
BELIEVE IT EITHER.

04:38.579 --> 04:40.911
SHE BETTER REALLY BE DYING
OR I'M GOING TO BE PISSED.

04:46.787 --> 04:48.688
WELCOME TO MOLLER
STREET, EVERYBODY!

04:48.689 --> 04:50.620
THIS IS THE VIA
VENETO OF SECAUCUS!

04:50.621 --> 04:54.023
LITERALLY THE HIGHEST CONCENTRATION
OF LONGOS ON THE EASTERN SEABOARD.

04:54.024 --> 04:57.467
- SO THE WHOLE LONGO MOB LIVES HERE, HUH?
- HEY, YO YO YO,

04:57.468 --> 05:00.571
- WE DON'T USE THE "M" WORD IN THIS NEIGHBORHOOD, ALL RIGHT?
- WHAT, MAFIA?

05:02.433 --> 05:04.635
WHAT'S UP, MR. SPIZERI?
HOW YOU DOIN'?

05:06.437 --> 05:08.438
ALL RIGHT, YEAH!

05:08.439 --> 05:10.780
SO HOW'S MY BEAUTIFUL
WIFE DOING IN THERE, HUH?

05:10.781 --> 05:14.514
( groans ) JUST ADJUSTING
MY GOLDEN GLOBES.

05:14.515 --> 05:16.746
ARE THEY SYMMETRICAL?

05:16.747 --> 05:18.648
- MAY I?
- YEAH, GO FOR IT.

05:18.649 --> 05:20.691
I CAN'T FEEL A THING. THIS
IS ALL PUSH-UP AND PADDING.

05:24.024 --> 05:25.995
IT'S IDENTICAL
TWINS, RIGHT, GUYS?

05:25.996 --> 05:28.428
JO-EEEEY!

05:28.429 --> 05:30.530
MOM, HEY!

05:30.531 --> 05:33.603
ARE YOU EVEN MORE HANDSOME
THAN YOU WERE THE LAST TIME?

05:33.604 --> 05:35.705
( laughs ) I THINK SO.

05:35.706 --> 05:38.768
- THAT'S MY BOY. THAT'S MY BOY.
- Both: MWAH MWAH!

05:38.769 --> 05:40.840
AND HERE'S THE FAMILY.

05:40.841 --> 05:43.743
IS THIS THE MEL BURKE?

05:43.744 --> 05:45.445
THIS IS MEL BURKE.

05:45.446 --> 05:48.047
THIS IS TIFFANY.

05:48.048 --> 05:50.850
GOT IT. AND THESE ARE THE
KIDS WITH THE WEIRD NAMES?

05:50.851 --> 05:53.583
YEAH, THIS IS LENNOX, THAT THERE
IS RYDER, THIS IS MY MOTHER.

05:53.584 --> 05:54.624
- HI.
- HOW'S IT GOING?

05:54.625 --> 05:57.757
- HEY, HOW'S NONA DOING?
- FANTASTIC!

05:57.758 --> 06:00.029
CONSIDERING SHE'S
AT DEATH'S DOOR...

06:00.030 --> 06:02.962
HOLD ON. THAT'S HOW
YOU'RE WALKING?

06:02.963 --> 06:05.435
- IT'S WORKED MY WHOLE LIFE.
- NO.

06:05.436 --> 06:07.397
ANYBODY CAN SEE
IT'S NOT TIFFANY.

06:07.398 --> 06:08.798
MUCH TOO LADY-LIKE.

06:08.799 --> 06:10.870
YOU GOTTA WORK IT LIKE
A SKANKY DEBUTANTE.

06:10.871 --> 06:13.743
TRAMP, SLUT, TRAMP,
SLUT, TRAMP, SLUT,

06:13.744 --> 06:17.647
TRAMP, SLUT, TRAMP, SLUT SLUT,
TRAMP TRAMP, SLUT SLUT...

06:17.648 --> 06:20.611
MOM, MOM. WE GET IT. WE GET IT.
THE WHOLE NEIGHBORHOOD GETS IT.

06:22.453 --> 06:23.754
C'MON, GUYS.

06:25.556 --> 06:27.917
- ( door closes )
- SHH SHH SHH!

06:27.918 --> 06:30.490
- OKAY OKAY.
- YO, BIG SIS!

06:30.491 --> 06:32.492
SHH, JOEY! NONA'S SLEEPING.

06:32.493 --> 06:35.164
THANK GOD THE DOCTORS STILL
LET US GIVE HER WINE.

06:35.165 --> 06:37.727
- UNCLE JOE!
- HEY.

06:37.728 --> 06:39.499
HOW WAS THE DRIVE? DID
YOU TAKE THE PARKWAY?

06:39.500 --> 06:42.432
NO, I-95. 65 MILES PER
THE WHOLE WAY, NO TOLLS.

06:42.433 --> 06:45.505
- THAT IS GENIUS.
- WE'LL LET THE HISTORIANS JUDGE, KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

06:45.506 --> 06:47.477
YEAH, GUYS, THIS IS
MY NEPHEW MARCO.

06:47.478 --> 06:49.679
MARCO, MEET RYDER AND
THAT THERE IS LENNOX.

06:49.680 --> 06:52.442
LENNOX? THAT'S NOT A
MOLLER-STREET NAME.

06:52.443 --> 06:55.184
IT'S SCOTTISH. IT MEANS
"WITH MANY ELM TREES."

06:55.185 --> 06:57.818
I DON'T KNOW ANY ELM TREES,
BUT I BET I'D LIKE 'EM.

06:59.520 --> 07:02.452
SO DO WE JUST STAND HERE
UNTIL SHE WAKES UP OR...

07:02.453 --> 07:04.594
- DOESN'T WAKE UP?
- LET HER SLEEP.

07:04.595 --> 07:07.927
WE'LL GET YOU FOLKS FED,
ESPECIALLY THE SKINNY BOY.

07:07.928 --> 07:10.500
- C'MON.
- ALL RIGHT, THE SKINNY BOY!

07:10.501 --> 07:12.662
I ALREADY HAVE A STREET NAME.

07:12.663 --> 07:14.504
( clatters )

07:14.505 --> 07:18.608
HEY, NONA! HEY, IT'S ME... JOEY!

07:18.609 --> 07:20.439
JOEY!

07:20.440 --> 07:22.942
OH, AND IS THAT TIFFANY?

07:22.943 --> 07:24.874
WHO ELSE WOULD IT BE?

07:24.875 --> 07:27.117
OH OH.

07:28.919 --> 07:31.450
( Joe chuckles ) WHAT ARE YOU...

07:31.451 --> 07:32.953
( chuckles ) IT'S...

07:35.085 --> 07:37.727
- IT'S REALLY YOU!
- ( laughs )

07:37.728 --> 07:39.158
OH, MY TIFFANY!

07:39.159 --> 07:40.189
AND YOU, JOEY!

07:40.190 --> 07:42.462
- MA FAMILIA!
- HEY!

07:44.495 --> 07:46.096
WE'RE IN.

07:53.103 --> 07:57.006
99 YEARS OLD TOMORROW, WOW,

07:57.007 --> 07:59.649
- WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO GET HER?
- SOFT FOOD.

07:59.650 --> 08:03.983
SO, LENNOX, GIRL OF THE ELMS,

08:03.984 --> 08:06.155
- LISTEN...
- I HAVE A BOYFRIEND. THANK YOU.

08:06.156 --> 08:08.157
AND I'M SURE HE'S A GREAT GUY.

08:08.158 --> 08:10.560
I WAS JUST GONNA OFFER TO SHOW
YOU AROUND THE NEIGHBORHOOD.

08:10.561 --> 08:12.992
THERE MIGHT BE A BODY
FLOATING DOWN THE RIVER.

08:12.993 --> 08:15.796
I'M KIDDING. THEY FISHED
IT OUT LAST WEEK.

08:17.668 --> 08:21.631
WELL, I AM VERY CURIOUS
ABOUT NEW JERSEY...

08:21.632 --> 08:24.133
ITS WAYS AND CUSTOMS,
YOUR CULTURAL MORES.

08:24.134 --> 08:26.205
HEY, THERE'S A BRAND-NEW DOLLAR
STORE THAT JUST OPENED UP.

08:26.206 --> 08:29.008
YOU CAN BUY A PACK OF "AA"
BATTERIES FOR A BUCK.

08:29.009 --> 08:31.010
WELL, WHAT ARE WE WAITING FOR?

08:31.011 --> 08:35.014
HEY, MARCO! STOP FLIRTING AND
GET NONA A FRESH PILLOWCASE.

08:35.015 --> 08:36.246
I'M ON IT, MA.

08:38.048 --> 08:40.650
SO WHAT DO YOU MEAN
YOU HAVE A BOYFRIEND?

08:40.651 --> 08:44.193
AREN'T YOU AND ZANDER ON A WHOLE PRE-COLLEGE
TRIAL-SEPARATION "PAUSE" THING?

08:44.194 --> 08:48.127
YES. HOWEVER, I AM UTTERLY
UNINTERESTED IN SOMEONE LIKE MARCO,

08:48.128 --> 08:50.229
SO I LIED AND SAID I WAS TAKEN.

08:50.230 --> 08:52.802
ALL GIRLS SAY THAT TO
GUYS THEY DON'T LIKE.

08:52.803 --> 08:54.203
THEY DO?

08:54.204 --> 08:56.266
THAT EXPLAINS SO MUCH.

08:57.307 --> 09:00.239
JOEY, THAT WAS THE FIRST TIME

09:00.240 --> 09:03.943
YOUR GRANDMOTHER HAS BEEN
ON HER FEET IN A WEEK.

09:03.944 --> 09:06.015
AND YOU KNOW WHY?

09:06.016 --> 09:08.948
YOU. SHE SAW "TIFFANY"

09:08.949 --> 09:11.651
AND IT GAVE HER
THE WILL TO LIVE.

09:11.652 --> 09:13.322
HA! AND YOU DIDN'T THINK
I COULD PULL THIS OFF.

09:13.323 --> 09:15.855
NO, THAT WAS YOU. I
BEGGED YOU TO DO IT.

09:15.856 --> 09:18.758
- LET IT GO.
- I WILL SAY THIS:

09:18.759 --> 09:21.962
SHE IS A BIG IMPROVEMENT OVER
THE ORIGINAL BLOW-UP DOLL.

09:23.634 --> 09:25.995
MEL BURKE, YOU ARE
OBVIOUSLY A VERY GIVING

09:25.996 --> 09:30.299
- AND SELFLESS PERSON.
- SEE, SHE GETS ME.

09:30.300 --> 09:33.172
HEY, GLORIA, DO YOU HAVE
ANY MORE OF THAT CAPA...

09:33.173 --> 09:34.944
CAPA MEAT STUFF?

09:34.945 --> 09:37.647
CAPICOLA. CAPICOLA.

09:37.648 --> 09:39.248
CAPICOLA. CAPICOLA.

09:39.249 --> 09:41.110
- SAY IT.
- CAPICOLA?

09:41.111 --> 09:42.982
HE'S ITALIAN!

09:42.983 --> 09:44.914
AND SO HANDSOME.

09:44.915 --> 09:47.086
YOU REMIND ME OF
THIS ONE OVER HERE.

09:47.087 --> 09:49.919
NOW YOU JUST SIT DOWN AND
I WILL DO EVERYTHING.

09:49.920 --> 09:52.822
- YOU'VE HAD A HARD DAY.
- BUT I WAS JUST SITTING IN A CAR.

09:52.823 --> 09:55.094
WASTING AWAY IN A
CAR IF YOU ASK ME.

09:55.095 --> 09:57.967
NOW YOU JUST SIT DOWN AND
EAT WHILE I TELL YOU

09:57.968 --> 10:01.270
WHAT A GOOD-LOOKING AND
WONDERFUL BOY YOU ARE.

10:01.271 --> 10:05.234
WOW, WE ARE WITNESSING THE
ORIGIN STORY OF JOE'S EGO.

10:05.235 --> 10:08.038
- ( Ryder chuckles )
- YEAH.

10:11.081 --> 10:13.142
- HEY.
- JOEY, WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

10:13.143 --> 10:15.614
IN 20 MINUTES WE WAKE HER
TO WATCH "JEOPARDY."

10:15.615 --> 10:18.387
I MEAN, SHE DOESN'T KNOW ANY OF THE
ANSWERS, BUT SHE LIKES THE SONG.

10:18.388 --> 10:21.691
- WE'RE JUST GOING TO GO TO THE HOTEL.
- TIFFANY!

10:21.692 --> 10:23.292
( screams ) OH, IT'S GOT ME!

10:23.293 --> 10:26.395
- I MEAN, UH, YES, NONA?
- WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

10:26.396 --> 10:28.658
WE'LL BE BACK IN A
COUPLE HOURS, OKAY?

10:28.659 --> 10:30.059
DON'T LEAVE ME.

10:30.060 --> 10:33.262
I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH TIME I HAVE LEFT.
I'M SO WEAK.

10:33.263 --> 10:35.404
OW OW OW OW OW!

10:35.405 --> 10:37.937
PLEASE, STAY IN
THIS HOUSE TONIGHT.

10:37.938 --> 10:40.109
IF WE DO, WILL YOU LET GO?

10:40.110 --> 10:42.411
YOU CAN SLEEP IN
JOEY'S OLD ROOM.

10:42.412 --> 10:44.944
US? TOGETHER?

10:44.945 --> 10:47.848
LIKE A MARRIED COUPLE DOES.

10:49.019 --> 10:52.351
UH, YES YES. OF
COURSE WE WILL, NONA.

10:52.352 --> 10:54.884
- ANYTHING YOU SAY.
- BUT, JOEJOEBEE,

10:54.885 --> 10:57.426
- WE HAVE A HOTEL RESERVATION.
- YES, TIFFYPOP,

10:57.427 --> 11:00.029
BUT NONA'S DYING FOR
US TO SLEEP HERE.

11:00.030 --> 11:01.831
OKEYDOKEY. WE'LL STAY HERE.

11:01.832 --> 11:03.292
( chuckles )

11:03.293 --> 11:05.434
IT'S A SMALL BED.

11:05.435 --> 11:08.438
SO YOU'RE GONNA HAVE
TO GET REAL COZY.

11:09.840 --> 11:11.300
( laughs )

11:11.301 --> 11:13.904
I JUST MADE A JOKE.

11:14.975 --> 11:16.346
- ( slaps )
- OW!

11:19.049 --> 11:21.310
YOUR SWEET OLD GRANDMOTHER
JUST GROPED ME ON THE ASS.

11:21.311 --> 11:23.884
IF YOU'RE GONNA SHAKE IT LIKE
THAT, YOU CAN'T BLAME HER.

11:25.315 --> 11:27.186
HEY, SO AS SOON AS THE
HOUSE QUIETS DOWN,

11:27.187 --> 11:29.789
I'LL MOVE DOWNSTAIRS AND BUNK
IN THE SPARE ROOM, OKAY?

11:29.790 --> 11:31.390
WELL, I AM NOT SLEEPING

11:31.391 --> 11:34.824
UNDER A POSTER OF WHOEVER
THAT CHICK IS ON THE CEILING.

11:34.825 --> 11:38.067
ARE YOU KIDDING ME? WHO GREW UP IN
AMERICA AND DIDN'T KNOW WHO VENDELA WAS?

11:38.068 --> 11:40.369
- WHO?
- VENDELA KIRSEBOM,

11:40.370 --> 11:42.201
THE SWIMSUIT MODEL.
C'MON, SHE WAS HUGE.

11:42.202 --> 11:45.004
ACTUALLY IN THIS NEIGHBORHOOD SHE WAS
EVEN BIGGER THAN ASHLEY MONTANA.

11:45.005 --> 11:46.906
AGAIN, WHO?

11:46.907 --> 11:48.407
THAT ONE OVER THERE,

11:48.408 --> 11:51.941
WITH THE SNAKE COVERING
UP ALL THE GOOD STUFF.

11:51.942 --> 11:55.444
YOU KNOW WHAT? YOU AND THE GIRLS CAN
STAY HERE AND RELIVE THE GLORY DAYS

11:55.445 --> 11:57.987
AND I'LL GO FIND A ROOM WHERE
THE DECOR IS A LITTLE LESS

11:57.988 --> 12:00.290
"MA, WOULD YOU KNOCK FIRST?!"

12:03.453 --> 12:05.255
HOW YOU LADIES BEEN?

12:06.957 --> 12:08.899
( door opens )

12:16.867 --> 12:19.138
AHH AHH! NONA!

12:19.139 --> 12:22.211
UH, LOOK AT YOU,
SMACKING PEOPLE AWAKE.

12:22.212 --> 12:25.976
I KNOW THE TRUTH! YOU ARE
NOT FOOLING ANYBODY.

12:33.023 --> 12:34.854
I KNOW WHAT'S REALLY GOING ON!

12:34.855 --> 12:37.156
UM, WELL, YOU SEE, I...

12:37.157 --> 12:39.859
I DID IT ALL FOR JOE. IT
COMES FROM A GOOD PLACE.

12:39.860 --> 12:41.760
DON'T DIE, OKAY?

12:41.761 --> 12:44.163
THERE IS TROUBLE
IN THIS MARRIAGE.

12:44.164 --> 12:45.534
OH, MARRIAGE!

12:45.535 --> 12:48.167
NO NO, THERE'S NO TROUBLE.

12:48.168 --> 12:50.870
NO, THIS IS WHAT WE DO
TO KEEP THINGS FRESH.

12:50.871 --> 12:53.472
YOU KNOW, WHEN JOE WANTS ME,
HE HAS TO COME FIND ME.

12:53.473 --> 12:55.345
COME AND GET ME, JOEJOEBEE!

12:56.546 --> 12:59.348
A WIFE SHOULD SHARE
HER HUSBAND'S BED.

12:59.349 --> 13:02.012
- GENERALLY YES...
- HEY, WHAT'S UP?

13:03.053 --> 13:05.214
- NONA!
- YOU FOUND ME, LOVER!

13:05.215 --> 13:07.256
I WAS JUST EXPLAINING
TO DEAR NONA

13:07.257 --> 13:11.020
HOW I LIKE TO HIDE, WHICH EXPLAINS
WHY I WASN'T SLEEPING IN YOUR BED.

13:11.021 --> 13:13.322
OHHH, YES YES.

13:13.323 --> 13:15.865
YES, THAT'S SOMETHING
THAT WE LIKE TO DO.

13:15.866 --> 13:17.026
IT KEEPS IT EXCITING.

13:17.027 --> 13:18.527
- ( laughs ) WHERE ARE YOU, HUH?
- BOO.

13:18.528 --> 13:20.029
- WHERE ARE YOU?
- BOO.

13:20.030 --> 13:21.400
THERE SHE IS. SHE'S
RIGHT THERE, YOU SEE...

13:21.401 --> 13:23.903
THERE IS GREAT UNHAPPINESS
BETWEEN YOU TWO.

13:23.904 --> 13:27.136
THAT'S WHY THERE ARE NO
CHILDREN IN THIS MARRIAGE.

13:27.137 --> 13:29.038
- OOH.
- OH OH OH, HERE HERE HERE.

13:29.039 --> 13:31.010
COME ON, LET'S SET YOU DOWN.
COME ON.

13:31.011 --> 13:32.541
MEL, UP PLEASE, THANK YOU.

13:32.542 --> 13:34.944
THANK YOU, MEL.
THERE YOU GO, NONA.

13:34.945 --> 13:36.585
WHO'S MEL?

13:36.586 --> 13:40.089
MEL... THAT'S... IT'S A... THAT'S
A NICKNAME THAT I CALL HER.

13:40.090 --> 13:42.251
YEAH YEAH, IT STANDS FOR...

13:42.252 --> 13:44.423
MY ETERNAL LOVE.

13:44.424 --> 13:46.555
MY HUSBAND USED TO
CALL ME STREGA.

13:46.556 --> 13:48.827
AREN'T PET NAMES SWEET?

13:48.828 --> 13:51.030
IT MEANS "WITCH"!

13:51.031 --> 13:52.932
AWWW.

13:52.933 --> 13:55.204
I WANT TO SPEAK TO YOUR
WIFE FOR A MOMENT.

13:55.205 --> 13:56.966
SURE, YEAH. OKAY, HERE.

13:56.967 --> 13:58.407
- ALL RIGHT.
- HERE, HONEY.

13:58.408 --> 14:00.370
GOOD. TIFFANY?

14:01.972 --> 14:03.873
ME? OH YEAH, SHOOT. AHEM.

14:03.874 --> 14:05.474
HOW MANY TIMES A WEEK

14:05.475 --> 14:08.948
DO YOU HAVE MARITAL RELATIONS?

14:08.949 --> 14:11.080
WELL, THAT'S PRETTY ♪ PERSONAL ♪

14:11.081 --> 14:13.622
♪ THAT'S WHY I'M ASKING! ♪

14:13.623 --> 14:14.954
UH...

14:14.955 --> 14:16.986
HOW MANY TIMES?

14:16.987 --> 14:19.428
UH, TWICE! TWICE A WEEK.

14:19.429 --> 14:20.430
THAT'S NOT ENOUGH!

14:22.192 --> 14:24.393
A MAN NEEDS COMFORT
FROM A WOMAN,

14:24.394 --> 14:29.038
ESPECIALLY IF HE'S A BIG MAN IN
THE BUSINESS WORLD LIKE JOSEPH,

14:29.039 --> 14:31.070
UP IN HIS HIGH BUILDING.

14:31.071 --> 14:33.572
YOU CAPTURE HIM SO WELL.

14:33.573 --> 14:36.245
I KNOW HE CAN BE A
LITTLE HEADSTRONG.

14:36.246 --> 14:39.578
THAT'S WHAT HE'S BEEN LIKE
SINCE HIS FATHER WALKED OUT.

14:39.579 --> 14:44.054
AND JOEY WAS ONLY 10 AND HE HAD
TO BE THE MAN OF THE HOUSE.

14:46.216 --> 14:48.217
ALL RIGHT, NOW SWITCH, SWITCH.

14:48.218 --> 14:51.260
I WANT TO TALK TO MY
FAVORITE GRANDSON.

14:51.261 --> 14:54.224
SORRY ABOUT THAT. THEY ALL LOVE ME HERE.
I CAN DO NO WRONG.

14:55.325 --> 14:57.626
OW, WHOA!

14:57.627 --> 14:59.368
WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH YOU, HUH?

14:59.369 --> 15:01.400
THIS WOMAN IS AN ANGEL.

15:01.401 --> 15:05.034
I HAVE ALWAYS TOLD YOU THAT.

15:05.035 --> 15:08.007
- STOP FIGHTING WITH HER.
- I'M NOT FIGHTING WITH HER.

15:08.008 --> 15:10.279
DON'T LIE TO A DYING LADY!

15:10.280 --> 15:12.541
HEY, NOT THE CANE, OKAY?
NOT THE CANE.

15:12.542 --> 15:14.044
ALL RIGHT, NOW HOLD HANDS.

15:15.245 --> 15:16.245
HOLD HANDS.

15:16.246 --> 15:20.249
OOOH, LOOK AT YOU TWO.

15:20.250 --> 15:22.622
YOU'RE MADE FOR EACH OTHER.

15:25.555 --> 15:27.957
LOOK, YOU DIDN'T HAVE
TO BUY ME FLOWERS.

15:27.958 --> 15:30.259
- HERE.
- BUT YOU LOOK GOOD WITH THEM.

15:30.260 --> 15:32.401
THEY BRING OUT YOUR PRETTY EYES.

15:32.402 --> 15:36.005
ALL RIGHT, LOOK, MARCO, WHILE I
APPRECIATE THE TOUR OF THE MEAT DISTRICT

15:36.006 --> 15:39.438
- AND SEEING ALL THE PIGS' HEADS DANGLING...
- THAT'S SOMETHING, ISN'T IT?

15:39.439 --> 15:42.641
...I JUST... I NEED YOU TO UNDERSTAND
THAT THIS IS GOING TO STAY PLATONIC.

15:42.642 --> 15:46.575
I DON'T KNOW THAT WORD, BUT
I GET IT THROUGH CONTEXT.

15:46.576 --> 15:49.979
LISTEN, WHILE WE'RE HERE I GOTTA
GET CIGARETTES FOR MY DAD.

15:49.980 --> 15:52.982
TURNS OUT THEY'RE
NOT SO BAD FOR YOU.

15:52.983 --> 15:54.554
I'M NOT SERIOUS.

15:58.588 --> 16:00.991
NICE FLOWERS. WHAT
ARE THOSE, TULIPS?

16:02.032 --> 16:03.362
I THINK SO.

16:03.363 --> 16:05.364
I KNOW WHERE SHE OUGHTA
PUT HER TWO LIPS.

16:05.365 --> 16:08.397
- RIGHT HERE.
- ALL RIGHT, GUYS, GIVE IT A REST.

16:08.398 --> 16:10.339
- IT'S NOT WORKING.
- OH, IT COULD WORK.

16:10.340 --> 16:12.371
- AND I COULD SHOW YOU HOW.
- JUST LEAVE ME ALONE.

16:12.372 --> 16:14.973
THAT SOUNDED PRETTY CLEAR TO ME, FELLAS.
SHE SAID LEAVE HER ALONE.

16:14.974 --> 16:17.746
- WHO CARES WHAT YOU THINK?
- WELL, THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION.

16:17.747 --> 16:20.350
- LET MY FRIEND KNUCKLES EXPLAIN IT TO YOU.
- ( grunts )

16:22.152 --> 16:24.314
HEY! YOU FORGOT
YOUR GARBAGE HERE!

16:31.661 --> 16:34.023
I'M REALLY SORRY ABOUT THAT.

16:34.024 --> 16:36.095
- ARE YOU OKAY?
- VERY MUCH SO.

16:36.096 --> 16:38.297
HOW'S YOUR HAND?

16:38.298 --> 16:40.130
LONELY.

16:46.106 --> 16:48.637
AUNT LENA, UNCLE VINCE, WHAT'S UP?
PAULIE, HEY!

16:48.638 --> 16:51.480

- OH, NOW THAT ALL THE HARD WORK IS DONE,

16:51.481 --> 16:53.742
MR. THINKS-HE'S-SO-CHARMING-
SHOWS-UP-ASKING-IF-HE-CAN-HELP.

16:53.743 --> 16:56.415
YOU LOOK GREAT, THERESA. YOU
LOST WEIGHT, DIDN'T YOU?

16:56.416 --> 16:58.087
I DID. THANKS FOR NOTICING.

16:58.088 --> 17:00.018
YEAH! ( chuckles )

17:00.019 --> 17:01.591
( gasps )

17:02.792 --> 17:04.523
WHAT THE HECK'S GOING ON THERE?

17:04.524 --> 17:07.126
- THEY MAKE A CUTE COUPLE, DON'T THEY?
- NO, THEY DON'T.

17:07.127 --> 17:09.698
HEY, MARCO,

17:09.699 --> 17:12.061
YOU KNOW SHE'S ONLY HERE
FOR ONE MORE DAY, RIGHT?

17:12.062 --> 17:13.732
- YEAH, I CAN COUNT.
- OH, GOOD.

17:13.733 --> 17:16.105
'CAUSE YOU KNOW EVEN THOUGH I'M
YOUR UNCLE AND I LOVE YOU,

17:16.106 --> 17:17.466
MY LOVE HAS LIMITS. ( chuckles )

17:17.467 --> 17:18.737
PHYSICAL LIMITS.

17:18.738 --> 17:21.440
IT'S NONA'S BIG DAY, UNCLE
JOE, C'MON, LIGHTEN UP.

17:21.441 --> 17:23.142
HEY, C'MON, HEY HEY.

17:23.143 --> 17:25.214

- ( groans )

17:25.215 --> 17:27.616
I COULD GET OUT OF
THIS IF I WANTED.

17:27.617 --> 17:29.519
( laughs ) NO, YOU COULDN'T.

17:30.780 --> 17:33.052
WOW, THERE'S JUST SO
MUCH TESTOSTERONE HERE.

17:34.724 --> 17:37.055
MA, WE ONLY GOT 94 CANDLES.

17:37.056 --> 17:39.689
THAT'S ALL THE FIRE
MARSHAL WOULD ALLOW.

17:41.591 --> 17:43.762
SO, RYDER,

17:43.763 --> 17:46.495
( chuckles ) ARE YOU HAPPY HERE?

17:46.496 --> 17:48.737
ARE WE TREATING YOU WELL?

17:48.738 --> 17:50.639
ARE YOU KIDDING? YOU'RE
TREATING ME LIKE A KING.

17:50.640 --> 17:54.343
I'M SO GLAD YOU APPRECIATE
ALL WE HAVE DONE FOR YOU.

17:54.344 --> 17:57.706
AND NOW IN RETURN

17:57.707 --> 18:01.110
I MUST ASK THAT YOU
DO ME A SERVICE.

18:01.111 --> 18:04.213
A SERVICE? WHAT...
WHAT KIND OF SERVICE?

18:04.214 --> 18:06.415
LIKE TAKE OUT THE
RECYCLING OR...

18:06.416 --> 18:09.388
A PROBLEM HAS COME
INTO OUR NEIGHBORHOOD

18:09.389 --> 18:12.391
AND YOU, RYDER, MUST
TAKE CARE OF IT.

18:12.392 --> 18:14.323
( inhales )

18:14.324 --> 18:17.267
I NEED YOU TO KILL A RAT.

18:19.329 --> 18:20.799
YOU MEAN MURDER?

18:20.800 --> 18:24.633
WHEN A THIEF STEALS
IN THIS NEIGHBORHOOD,

18:24.634 --> 18:27.406
HE MUST PAY WITH HIS LIFE.

18:27.407 --> 18:29.878
BUT I... I'VE... I'VE
NEVER KILLED BEFORE.

18:29.879 --> 18:33.612
THIS IS WHAT'S EXPECTED
OF THE MEN IN OUR FAMILY.

18:33.613 --> 18:35.844
MA, I NEED YOU. NONA
CAN'T FIND HER TEETH.

18:35.845 --> 18:39.518
DID ANYBODY CHECK BETWEEN
THE SOFA CUSHIONS?

18:39.519 --> 18:42.222
I'LL DO IT LIKE I
DO EVERYTHING ELSE.

18:43.853 --> 18:45.754
SO MA'S PUTTING YOU TO WORK?

18:45.755 --> 18:47.457

18:50.560 --> 18:51.631
AWW.

18:54.264 --> 18:56.635
ALL RIGHT, EVERYONE
NEEDS A FULL GLASS!

18:56.636 --> 18:59.668

THE BIRTHDAY GIRL.

18:59.669 --> 19:02.641
NO! MY FAVORITES WILL
DRINK THE GOOD STUFF

19:02.642 --> 19:05.374
FROM THIS SPECIAL BOTTLE.
NOW DON'T SPILL ANY.

19:05.375 --> 19:08.747
TRUST ME, I AM VERY SKILLED
AT NOT WASTING ALCOHOL.

19:08.748 --> 19:11.380
I THINK THAT'S WHY I
FELL IN LOVE WITH HER.

19:11.381 --> 19:13.723
EVERYONE RAISE YOUR GLASSES!

19:15.455 --> 19:17.356

19:17.357 --> 19:19.588

ANOTHER HUNDRED YEARS.

19:19.589 --> 19:20.760
GOD FORBID!

19:22.362 --> 19:24.534

19:29.599 --> 19:32.401
( coughs ) THAT'S SOME OLD-COUNTRY
MOONSHINE RIGHT THERE.

19:32.402 --> 19:36.206
DRINK! EMPTY THE GLASS
OTHERWISE YOU DISHONOR ME.

19:38.177 --> 19:40.879
WOW, THIS RUST-REMOVER
KINDA GROWS ON YOU

19:40.880 --> 19:42.911
- ONCE YOUR MOUTH STOPS BURNING.
- ( coughs )

19:42.912 --> 19:46.815
- ARE YOU BEGINNING TO FEEL IT?
- GIVE ME THAT!

19:46.816 --> 19:49.618
NONA, YOU DIDN'T!

19:49.619 --> 19:51.560
I DID!

19:51.561 --> 19:53.522
IT'S FINE. THEY'RE
A MARRIED COUPLE.

19:53.523 --> 19:55.764
NO, THEY'RE NOT!

19:55.765 --> 19:58.967
...NOT ACCUSTOMED TO
