00:02.207 --> 00:06.200
Now nobody's saying the Chatsworth Estate
is the Garden of Eden,

00:06.247 --> 00:08.522
but it's been a good home to us, to me,

00:08.567 --> 00:13.357
Frank Gallagher, and me kids who
l'm proud of, cos every single one of 'em

00:13.407 --> 00:16.364
reminds me a little of me.

00:16.407 --> 00:22.084
They can all think for themselves,
which they've got me to thank for.

00:22.127 --> 00:25.756
Lip, who's a bit of a gobshite, which is why
nobody calls him Phillip any more.

00:25.807 --> 00:30.119
lan, a lot like his mam, which is handy for
the others cos she's disappeared into thin air.

00:30.167 --> 00:34.399
And Carl. We daren't let him
grow his hair for two reasons -

00:34.447 --> 00:37.962
it makes it stand on end and makes him
look like Toyah, and nits love him.

00:38.007 --> 00:41.079
Debbie - sent by God, total angel.

00:41.127 --> 00:44.119
You've to check your change
but she'll go miles out of her way

00:45.887 --> 00:48.606
plus lickle Liam,
who's gonna be a star some day.

00:48.647 --> 00:54.279
Sheila, me bird, couldn't be happier.
One plate short of a full set, like.

00:54.327 --> 00:57.478
And fantastic neighbours Kev
and Veronica - lend ya anything,

00:57.527 --> 00:58.880
well, almost anything.

00:58.927 --> 01:03.557
Carol and Marty - the lodgers from hell.
Last of the lonely hearts

01:03.607 --> 01:06.679
and a psychologist's wet dream.
Still, nobody's perfect.

01:06.727 --> 01:11.084
But all of 'em to a man
know first and foremost

01:11.127 --> 01:16.679
one of the most vital necessities in life
is they know how to throw a party!

01:16.727 --> 01:17.955
Heh, heh, heh, scatter!

01:18.007 --> 01:20.362
What's new, Pussycat?
Whoa, whoa, whoa

01:20.407 --> 01:25.527

Whoa, whoa, who-o-oa...

01:28.327 --> 01:31.797
..Pussycat, Pussycat,

01:31.847 --> 01:36.238
And lots of hours
to spend with you

01:36.287 --> 01:39.723
So go and powder
your cute little pussycat nose

01:41.727 --> 01:45.242
Pussycat, Pussycat, l love you

01:45.287 --> 01:48.245
Yes, l do...

01:48.287 --> 01:51.040
(lan) 'Someone once said
that life's what happens

01:51.087 --> 01:54.238
'when you're busy making other plans.
Feels about right.

01:54.287 --> 01:57.962
'We're all so busy looking at the road ahead,
we never really notice

01:58.007 --> 01:59.679
'where we're at, which is dangerous,

01:59.727 --> 02:03.436
'cos sometimes there's a great, big,
fucking juggernaut coming.'

02:03.487 --> 02:06.638
State of him. How does it happen?
How do you get like that?

02:06.687 --> 02:08.643
.. You're a tosser...

02:08.687 --> 02:11.599
- People love him.
- Yeah, l know. And it's pathetic.

02:11.647 --> 02:14.480
So, who are you going to vote for?
Queen?

02:14.527 --> 02:16.836
No-one. They're all terrible.

02:18.367 --> 02:21.086
..Pussycat, Pussycat, l love you

02:21.127 --> 02:24.563
.. Yes, l do

02:24.607 --> 02:28.805
lt's not unusual, you and your pussycat eyes,
both of them...

02:32.927 --> 02:35.282
How much for a tit wank, girls?

02:35.327 --> 02:37.124
Dunno. What you offering?

02:37.167 --> 02:38.805
Don't pay for it. Don't have to.

02:38.847 --> 02:42.601
- ls that right?
- Got 'em queuing round the block.

02:42.647 --> 02:44.763
- When you're ready.
- Gotta go.

02:44.807 --> 02:47.321
See you later, if you're lucky.

02:51.047 --> 02:53.117
Poke my sister, you're dead.

02:58.247 --> 03:03.640
He says, ''l'm sorry,
l'm out of milk and cat food... ''

03:05.207 --> 03:07.801
- We need words, councillor.
- The matter's closed.

03:07.847 --> 03:12.318
Far from it, Mr Karib. The Catholic Youth Club
provides an important social function,

03:12.367 --> 03:15.404
- knitting together this community...
- lt's a drugs den.

03:15.447 --> 03:18.325
- lts closure might...
- lt's a fucking drugs den.

03:18.367 --> 03:24.363
lt's not a drugs den. lt's a youth club, for good,
honest kids with nowhere else to go.

03:24.407 --> 03:28.320
And whilst it may be convenient
for you and your council cronies

03:28.367 --> 03:31.837
to dismiss that, so you can line
your pockets by selling the land,

03:31.887 --> 03:34.276
those kids need God's good guidance.

03:34.327 --> 03:37.797
- l've bought drugs from there.
- The motion's passed.

03:37.847 --> 03:40.236
lt's being demolished. End of story.

03:40.287 --> 03:43.404
The bird of paradise alights only upon the hand

03:43.447 --> 03:47.201
that does not grasp.
You might care to remember that.

03:55.967 --> 04:00.199
Here you go, Carol. Supplies,
courtesy of Hotel Britannica.

04:00.247 --> 04:01.839
l'm not sewing 'em now.

04:01.887 --> 04:05.038
- What have you brought it all here for?
- We're shooting off to a party.

04:05.087 --> 04:07.476
- What sort of party?
- Sort you're not coming to.

04:07.527 --> 04:09.757
- Hiya.
- Can you get us some take-outs?

04:09.807 --> 04:10.922
What you after?

04:10.967 --> 04:12.719
A few cans. Lager will do.

04:12.767 --> 04:14.723
Strongest you've got.

04:14.767 --> 04:19.158
- You're not inviting us?
- No offence, but it's gonna be pretty hardcore.

04:19.207 --> 04:21.402
- We can do hardcore, can't we, Marty?
- We've heard.

04:21.447 --> 04:23.005
Golden shower!

04:26.487 --> 04:30.446
Great stuff, great stuff.
Next we've got Wendy Wagstaff, everyone!

04:30.487 --> 04:35.436
Come on, Wendy. Hello, darlin'. Tell us
who you're gonna be tonight, Wendy.

04:35.487 --> 04:38.559

Why not? Sly half.
lt'll give the day an interesting spin.

05:41.447 --> 05:47.158

There's no way, Kel, not after last time.

- Veronica would have me bollocks in a bag.
- She doesn't like me.

06:33.167 --> 06:35.522
She caught you shooting up in our bog.

06:35.567 --> 06:37.683
l'm clean now. Honest.

06:37.727 --> 06:41.402
lt's not just that. lt's you two.
You're at each other like cat and dog.

06:41.447 --> 06:43.403
Dog's right, in her case.

06:43.447 --> 06:46.439

06:46.487 --> 06:50.605

Belinda says she'll take another...
What you doing? Scissors.

07:19.327 --> 07:23.639
..another 30 for the market, but only if we can
do them for the same price as last time.

07:23.687 --> 07:25.040
Morning.

07:26.047 --> 07:27.844
Morning.

07:33.207 --> 07:34.401
This is a blag.

07:38.007 --> 07:39.884
No, sorry. Put it back.

07:39.927 --> 07:42.839
- What?
- That bread was bought by communal money.

07:42.887 --> 07:46.084
Money earned by everyone,
with one exception.

07:46.127 --> 07:50.200
- So l starve cos l can't find work?
- You've not even looked. You're not trying.

07:50.247 --> 07:53.523
- l don't even live here.
- You act and eat as if you do.

07:54.807 --> 07:56.877
Everyone has to contribute, Sue.

07:56.927 --> 07:58.519
l'll pay for her.

07:58.567 --> 08:01.923
She's my guest, so l'll just earn twice as much.
Problem sorted.

08:01.967 --> 08:04.561
- How are you gonna do that?
- Get a job.

08:04.607 --> 08:07.326
You've been for a dozen jobs this year.
You've not got one.

08:07.367 --> 08:11.918
Donkeydick! Sorry. Bumface!
Motherfucker-shit-wank-twat-face! Woof!

08:12.927 --> 08:15.157
Look...

08:15.207 --> 08:17.960
l've put adverts up. Handyman.

08:18.007 --> 08:19.565
You know, fixing stuff.

08:19.607 --> 08:21.802
Sue reckons the work'll come rolling in.

08:21.847 --> 08:23.963
Fine, but we're not having passengers.

08:24.007 --> 08:26.680
lf you're staying here,
you pay your way.

08:30.047 --> 08:31.560
Bone idle!

08:42.246 --> 08:44.158
- l got your invite.
- What invite?

08:44.207 --> 08:46.767
From Jack. Said you'd told him to...

08:49.447 --> 08:52.644
He thinks he's funny.
He likes playing God with people.

08:52.687 --> 08:55.838
Maybe he was being benevolent.

08:55.887 --> 09:01.644
You know, forcing us together.
That's what we both want, innit?

09:01.687 --> 09:07.842
- Bit of time together.
- Whatever happened to courtship? Dates?

09:07.887 --> 09:10.242
Flowers?
lf all you want's a quick jump, Lip,

09:10.287 --> 09:12.721
you've got the wrong girl.

09:18.007 --> 09:22.478
Jack. Hiya. God, sorry,
l was miles away. Lip's not here.

09:22.527 --> 09:24.404
l'm not looking for Lip.

09:24.447 --> 09:27.359
Right. Um...

09:27.407 --> 09:29.238
Do you want a drink?

09:29.287 --> 09:31.357
All right.

09:31.407 --> 09:33.682
Unless you fancy something a bit stronger.

09:39.127 --> 09:41.641
That'll soften the edges.

09:45.007 --> 09:48.966
You're not kidding.
God, it's burning.

09:49.967 --> 09:51.525
Fuck, that's really...

10:04.007 --> 10:05.725
D'you like that?

10:14.487 --> 10:16.955
No, not yet. Tomorrow.

10:18.567 --> 10:20.603
Are you home?

10:20.647 --> 10:22.638
Definitely.

10:26.647 --> 10:28.126
Good.

10:34.247 --> 10:38.206
Ahh, Sadie.
All nice and clean now, aren't ya?

10:40.807 --> 10:45.881
Damsel in distress. Needing shelter,
somewhere to call home.

10:45.927 --> 10:49.078
Kelly. Kev's sister.

10:49.127 --> 10:52.563
- Oh. Pleased to meet you.
- Said she could have Karen's room.

10:52.607 --> 10:55.679
Right, er...
Shoes. Take your shoes off.

10:59.727 --> 11:01.843
(Frank) Up you come.

11:01.887 --> 11:06.085
Go on, make yourself comfy.
lt's at the back, here...

11:08.247 --> 11:09.726
< Frank...

11:11.647 --> 11:13.842
She used to be on drugs.

11:14.967 --> 11:17.117
Well, who didn't?

11:17.167 --> 11:21.797
l mean, what sort of society is it
if we can't offer forgiveness?

11:21.847 --> 11:25.920
lf a young deviant doesn't deserve
a second chance? Tell me that.

11:25.967 --> 11:29.437
lt would be nice to have
an extra pair of hands helping out.

11:29.487 --> 11:31.125
Exactly!

11:31.167 --> 11:33.476
Bit of company for you, help with the kids.

11:33.527 --> 11:35.722
She's like an au pair without the accent.

11:35.767 --> 11:40.238
Au pair? You're not gonna have sex
with her, are you?

11:40.287 --> 11:43.882
Only l've seen a documentary
about it on Channel Five.

11:43.927 --> 11:45.519
lt's almost an epidemic.

11:45.567 --> 11:47.842
Hello! Sex?

11:47.887 --> 11:49.798
l've got you, haven't l?

11:49.847 --> 11:53.237
Do you really think l'd be interested
in some slip of a girl?

11:54.807 --> 11:58.083
Gonna jump in t'shower.
Can l help meself to shampoo and that?

11:58.127 --> 11:59.606
Yeah.

12:25.367 --> 12:26.880
Anyone home?

13:01.287 --> 13:04.916
- There you go, Lillian.
- You haven't got anything to unblock drains,

13:04.967 --> 13:08.004
- have you, Kash?
- Not unless you wanna try the vodka.

13:10.207 --> 13:11.845
20 Bensons.

13:11.887 --> 13:13.798
5.20.

13:14.687 --> 13:16.564
The Catholic community is very loyal, Kash.

13:16.607 --> 13:20.919
lt'd be unfortunate if your livelihood
were to suffer because of their principles.

13:20.967 --> 13:22.958
ls that some kind of threat?

13:23.967 --> 13:26.276
God works in mysterious ways.

13:26.327 --> 13:29.842
So does Allah. Piss off
before l strangle you with your rosaries.

13:43.327 --> 13:44.965
< l've gotta go.

13:45.007 --> 13:46.918

When?

13:50.087 --> 13:52.282
Who knows?

13:52.327 --> 13:54.045
That's the fun of it.

14:07.207 --> 14:10.961
- Who says courtship's dead?
- You'll have to do better than that!

14:13.407 --> 14:15.318
Jesus!

Borrowing your hair dryer.
Mine's blown. Ask Marty.

14:54.887 --> 14:56.525
Well, don't look at me.

14:56.567 --> 14:58.603
Well, who else has been in there?

14:58.647 --> 15:02.560
You can accuse me of a lot of things,
Debbie, but l'm not a thief!

Do you need a lift anywhere?

15:47.727 --> 15:50.844
Nah. l'll walk. l fancy a bit of air.

16:39.607 --> 16:41.518

16:42.847 --> 16:44.838
(Get in, get in, get in.)

16:47.407 --> 16:50.160
What were you doing?

16:50.207 --> 16:53.802
Kelly. Bloke in with her. Shagging.

16:53.847 --> 16:56.566
- What, now?
- Yeah.

16:56.607 --> 16:58.484
- ln there?
- Yes.

16:58.527 --> 17:01.803
Two people, having sex...

17:02.847 --> 17:05.122
..on the other side of that wall.

17:08.527 --> 17:09.721
(Frank) Oh!

17:09.767 --> 17:12.804
- How blonde's blonde?
- l don't wanna look like Margi Clarke.

17:12.847 --> 17:14.803
l hope you're charging for that.

17:14.847 --> 17:16.326
Er...Debs!

17:16.367 --> 17:18.278
- She's been like this all week.
- Has she told you why?

17:18.327 --> 17:20.840
- Why what?
- Debbie thinks l've stolen money.

17:20.887 --> 17:23.924
- You can't say things like that.
- Well, someone has.

17:23.967 --> 17:28.404
Has anyone seen my keys? l can't find them.
They've got the shop keys on and everything.

17:28.446 --> 17:31.325
- Have you tried the bedroom?
- l never thought of that(!)

17:31.367 --> 17:34.598
This place is such a fucking tip,
they could be anywhere.

17:34.647 --> 17:36.763
- Right, l'm off to work.
- Look at you!

17:36.807 --> 17:40.038
Bloody hell!
l never thought l'd see the day!

17:40.087 --> 17:43.796
This is the new me. Sue reckons
there's no end to where it could lead.

17:43.847 --> 17:46.725
- See ya.
- Have a good day, worker.

17:46.767 --> 17:48.962
l'll cook you summat special for tea.

17:53.687 --> 17:57.965
Half of these are ballads.
l draw the line at fucking ballads.

17:58.007 --> 18:02.046
What about Goldfinger?
Everyone loves a Bond theme,

18:02.087 --> 18:04.237
apart from that one by Duran Duran.

18:04.287 --> 18:06.039
Morning. Morning.

18:06.087 --> 18:09.921
Got any juice?
Me mouth tastes like rotting fish.

18:09.967 --> 18:14.085
l've made breakfast.
Fresh coffee, toast.

18:14.127 --> 18:16.322
Brilliant. l'm starving.

18:16.367 --> 18:19.165
Er...will your friend be joining us?

18:19.207 --> 18:21.357
- No.
- Oh.

18:21.407 --> 18:25.764
He...shot off early.
He's a train driver, morning shift.

18:25.807 --> 18:28.196
Oh. That's a shame. >

18:29.687 --> 18:34.636
Tell him if he wants to join us again...
he's more than welcome.

18:46.447 --> 18:49.200
l thought your voice sounded familiar.

18:49.247 --> 18:51.886
Drains need doing.
They stink to high heaven.

18:51.927 --> 18:55.886
Spot of painting. My Brendan
used to do all this, God rest his soul.

18:55.927 --> 19:00.284
He were useless at most things,
but give him a trowel and some caustic soda -

19:00.327 --> 19:02.841
he was happy as a pig in shit. Kettle's on.

19:31.767 --> 19:34.725
Hey, Marty! Marty!

19:34.767 --> 19:37.235
Bastard! Arrgh! Arrgh!
GLASS SMASHES

19:38.607 --> 19:40.723
Oh, dear God! Marty!

19:40.767 --> 19:42.962
Oh, me hand!

19:43.007 --> 19:45.077
Wiggle your fingers for me.

19:45.127 --> 19:47.322
How do you know how to do all this?

19:47.367 --> 19:51.918
l do a first aid course at t'community centre.
You'd be surprised how often it comes in.

19:51.967 --> 19:55.846
- You'll have to rest that for a few days.
- No, l'm fine, honest!

19:55.887 --> 19:59.004
l need to keep working
and l need the money...

19:59.047 --> 20:03.325
And l like being here. l don't want
to let you down. Spunk-face! Ow!

20:03.367 --> 20:05.005
You remind me of my Brendan.

20:05.047 --> 20:09.598
People used to mock because of his stammer.
Anything wi' an S in it, you were buggered.

20:09.647 --> 20:13.037
But once you got to know him,
he had a heart of gold.

20:16.407 --> 20:18.079
lt's lonely without him, Marty.

20:18.127 --> 20:22.598
You don't realise what loneliness is
until you lose your soul mate.

20:28.167 --> 20:31.045
Will you stay to tea?
l've got a shepherd's pie in.

20:31.087 --> 20:33.476
lt were Brendan's favourite...

20:35.687 --> 20:39.646
l've only one pair of hands. lt's gonna take me
weeks to get through this lot.

20:39.687 --> 20:42.281
The concierge is ill at the moment
so it's easy pickings.

20:42.327 --> 20:46.366
- So when do we see our cut of this?
- When all the money comes in.

20:46.407 --> 20:49.240
- When's that likely to be?
- Don't worry, you'll get it.

20:50.047 --> 20:53.403
- l'm just gonna use your bog.
- Go for it.

21:02.727 --> 21:04.365
- What you doing?
- Forbidden fruit.

21:04.407 --> 21:06.716
Fuck off! Lip's downstairs.

21:06.767 --> 21:08.598
l'm sorry.

21:08.647 --> 21:12.242
Here. You left these in me car.

21:28.087 --> 21:30.885
Wow! You look amazing.

21:32.767 --> 21:34.962
Don't look so bad yourself.

21:42.407 --> 21:44.716
How're my two favourite girls?

21:46.007 --> 21:51.035
The trouble is you're too similar. You could be
bezzie mates if you'd only let yourselves.

21:51.847 --> 21:54.680
Oh, fuck's sake! Look. We're grown-ups.

21:54.727 --> 21:58.606
Can't we just have a drink
and let bygones be bygones?

21:58.647 --> 21:59.921
Suits me.

21:59.967 --> 22:01.036
Fine.

22:01.087 --> 22:03.760
Rum and coke and whatever for Blond...

22:03.807 --> 22:05.001
Veronica.

22:05.047 --> 22:07.720
There, now. Happy families.

22:08.607 --> 22:11.405
Actually, me date's here.

22:11.447 --> 22:13.517
lt'll have to be another time.

22:17.447 --> 22:22.077
We look out for each other, me and Jack.
We have to. We're the only family we've got.

22:22.127 --> 22:25.164
You can have a couple of ours, if you want.
Liam's cute.

22:25.207 --> 22:27.801
Bites a bit,
but he'll grow out of it eventually.

22:27.847 --> 22:29.519
Jack says you're clever.

22:29.567 --> 22:32.718
The last thing you need's
to get trapped round here.

22:32.767 --> 22:34.644
- l won't.
- How do you know?

22:34.687 --> 22:37.201
l'm different. Same again?

22:39.567 --> 22:41.922
Fucking wanker! Look at the state of her.

22:41.967 --> 22:44.765
- Your brother owes me money.
- You'll get it, arsehole!

22:44.807 --> 22:46.320
- You're gonna remind him.

22:46.367 --> 22:48.039
- Apologise.
- You what?

22:48.087 --> 22:51.045
- l said, apologise.
- Or you'll be doing what?

22:51.087 --> 22:55.717
Lip, leave it. l'm fine. l'll tell Jack to pay you
for the gear. Why don't we forget about it?

22:55.767 --> 22:57.803
Fucking slapper!

23:38.927 --> 23:42.158
He's calling her a dirty bitch.
He's asking her to bite him.

23:42.207 --> 23:44.118
Look, Sheila, l'm up for a bit of...

23:44.167 --> 23:47.443
l like kinky as much as the next bloke,
but this is...

23:47.487 --> 23:50.160
He's begging!
She's slapping him and he's begging!

23:50.207 --> 23:53.404
You'll be drilling a fucking hole next.
Can't we just...?

23:53.447 --> 23:57.725
This is the third night running.
No wonder the fucking trains are running late.

23:57.767 --> 24:02.477
This isn't the train driver. Nor was the one this
afternoon. Different voices, different requests.

24:02.527 --> 24:04.040
You what?

24:04.087 --> 24:06.965
She's playing the field, saucy minx.

24:08.047 --> 24:10.561
She's had sex with four different blokes!

24:10.607 --> 24:13.963
BUZZlNG
How many fucking boyfriends has she...?

24:14.007 --> 24:16.282
l've finally found something l'm good at.

24:16.327 --> 24:18.204
l just need a room, that's all.

24:18.247 --> 24:22.684
Oh, Jesus Christ!
Last little whorehouse in Chatsworth.

24:41.807 --> 24:44.241
Turn around and fuck off!

24:48.247 --> 24:51.876
Keep the money.
Just get the fuck out of my shop!

24:52.767 --> 24:54.678
Nowl

24:58.127 --> 25:01.324
THUDS AND CRlES

25:17.167 --> 25:20.443
DlSTANT SlREN

25:28.247 --> 25:30.715
How's my little sister getting on?

25:30.767 --> 25:32.564
Keeping herself out of trouble?

25:34.127 --> 25:35.924
She's a prostitute.

25:36.967 --> 25:39.845
Prostitute? As in...?

25:39.887 --> 25:46.076
Pros-tit-tute. Shags men, for money,
in my fucking house.

25:46.127 --> 25:50.917
Frank, that is my little sister you're calling
a tart, so you'd better have your facts.

25:50.967 --> 25:53.322
Men coming day and night, so to speak.

25:53.367 --> 25:58.236
Hour at a time. ''Lick me.''
''Spank me.'' ''Let me call you Mummy.''

25:58.287 --> 26:02.439
Where else do you think she's getting
the fucking wedge from?

26:02.487 --> 26:04.000
Oh, Jesus!

26:05.647 --> 26:09.640
l'll have words. l'll ask her to leave.
You can't have that going on in...

26:09.687 --> 26:11.564
You can't.

26:11.607 --> 26:13.086
Sheila likes it.

26:13.127 --> 26:14.685
- You what?
- Turns her on.

26:14.727 --> 26:16.683
Thinks Kelly's got a healthy sex life.

26:16.727 --> 26:20.037
She doesn't realise
she's living with Cynthia fucking Payne.

26:20.087 --> 26:22.043
Be getting luncheon vouchers next.

26:23.167 --> 26:24.964
What's up with you two?

26:26.327 --> 26:28.716
- On the game, Kel?
- What?

26:28.767 --> 26:32.316
Oh, have you got this off him?
Perveball?

26:32.367 --> 26:35.962
l can't walk round the house without
him undressing me with his eyes.

26:36.007 --> 26:36.996
Hey! No, she's...

26:37.047 --> 26:41.165
So l've had the odd man back.
Catching up for lost time, aren't l?

26:41.207 --> 26:45.120
That's the thing when you get clean,
your libido runs rampant.

26:46.207 --> 26:47.686
Here's your rent.

27:11.487 --> 27:13.364
He were laid there for hours. >

27:13.407 --> 27:15.875
Unconscious. Blood everywhere.

27:15.927 --> 27:18.316
- This is Father Crichton.
- That's what l said.

27:18.367 --> 27:21.837
- lt's gotta be, Kash.
- He makes threats and you end up like this.

27:21.887 --> 27:23.400
They were robbing us.

27:23.447 --> 27:27.360
They only got a bit of money,
a few tokens... Oh, and Kash's mobile.

27:27.407 --> 27:31.082
But there were no forced entry,
so God knows how they got in.

27:31.127 --> 27:32.719
They had keys.

27:34.287 --> 27:37.040
- You what?
- He reckons they had keys.

27:45.847 --> 27:48.281
How does it feel on?

27:48.327 --> 27:49.555
(Marty) Er...good.

27:49.607 --> 27:51.438
Length OK?

27:51.487 --> 27:53.398
(Marty) Perfect.

27:55.687 --> 27:57.166
Oh, God,

27:57.207 --> 27:59.880
it is... lt's him.

27:59.927 --> 28:03.715
lt's like seeing my Brendan
for the very first time.

28:03.767 --> 28:05.280
Say the line.

28:05.327 --> 28:06.806
Er...

28:06.847 --> 28:10.601
l haven't got much
sh-sh-shore leave, pretty lady,

28:10.647 --> 28:15.004
but what l have got,
l'd like to spend with you.

28:16.567 --> 28:17.920
Er, what do he call you?

28:17.967 --> 28:19.685
Lillian.

28:19.727 --> 28:23.242
Well, Lilly, may l buy you a drink?

28:23.287 --> 28:24.686
Pint of stout.

28:28.607 --> 28:32.236
Cos l hear mandolins in the moonlight...

28:32.287 --> 28:33.925
Prick-cunt!

29:10.167 --> 29:11.839
(Woman) Jack!

29:16.767 --> 29:18.485
All right.

29:22.407 --> 29:24.238
l won't be long.

29:29.047 --> 29:31.117
What the fuck are you doing
coming round here unannounced?

29:31.167 --> 29:33.203
Nice girlfriend, Jack. Fit an' all.

29:33.247 --> 29:34.566
- You can't turn up out of the blue.
- She know you like sucking cock?

29:34.607 --> 29:37.599
Shut it! l'll break your fucking legs.

29:37.647 --> 29:39.205
lt's you, innit?

29:39.247 --> 29:41.203
The break-in, the stolen money.

29:41.247 --> 29:43.158
No idea what you're talking about.

29:43.207 --> 29:44.196
You used me.

29:44.247 --> 29:45.396
lf you're gonna talk shit, lan...

29:45.447 --> 29:48.245
You left him for dead!

29:48.287 --> 29:50.164
He's my boyfriend.

29:51.727 --> 29:55.925
Bloke you knocked seven shades of
shit out of is my fucking boyfriend!

29:55.967 --> 29:57.116
lan. You're upset. But...

29:57.167 --> 29:58.805
Fuck off!

29:58.847 --> 30:02.044
You stole my keys. Used them
to do over the shop.

30:02.087 --> 30:05.557
You left 'em in my car. l give you
them back. Why would l do that, lan?

30:05.607 --> 30:07.916
Why would l not just chuck 'em?

30:07.967 --> 30:11.357
lf l were you, l'd think very
carefully about what you're accusing.

30:11.407 --> 30:13.796
Everything all right?

30:13.847 --> 30:16.407
Yeah, we've just finished.
Haven't we, lan?

30:35.127 --> 30:39.803
Why do birds suddenly appear

30:40.607 --> 30:44.316
Every time you are near?

30:46.607 --> 30:48.563
Just like me...

30:48.607 --> 30:50.996
l miss him so much.

30:51.047 --> 30:55.040
What if l die, Marty? What if l go
without ever being touched again?

30:55.087 --> 30:57.362
You might meet someone new.
Who knows?

30:57.407 --> 30:59.523
Attractive woman like... Saggy-fat!

30:59.567 --> 31:03.606
One night, Marty. l'll put a word in
down at t'community centre for ya.

31:03.647 --> 31:06.719
They're looking for
somebody permanent. Caretaker.

31:06.767 --> 31:08.564
You need never be out of work!

31:08.607 --> 31:11.679
l'd like to but... l've got
a girlfriend and she's lovely.

31:11.727 --> 31:14.287
lt's all in full working order.
l've even had a bath!

31:14.327 --> 31:16.079
lt's not that, honest, Lillian!

31:16.127 --> 31:19.324
l'll pay you! Double money.
Nobody need ever know!

31:22.527 --> 31:24.199
OK!

31:35.847 --> 31:37.724
Are you ready, Marty?

31:38.447 --> 31:40.324
Marty?

31:43.967 --> 31:45.719
l'm sorry! l'm really, really sorry!

31:45.767 --> 31:47.325
- Marty, what happened?
- Have you joined the navy?

31:47.367 --> 31:50.086
She went mental! Had me
dressing up as her dead husband.

31:50.127 --> 31:51.845
- Lillian?
- She wanted me to shag her!

31:51.887 --> 31:54.276
Offered money and everything.
Bucket of spunk!

31:54.327 --> 31:57.524
- Oh, Come here.
- l've let you down and lost me work.

31:57.567 --> 31:59.080

But it weren't my fault, honest!

31:59.127 --> 32:01.243
lt's all right. We'll manage!

32:01.287 --> 32:04.359
l notice they're looking for
checkout girls at Costchopper.

32:04.407 --> 32:06.398
£5.50 an hour.

32:07.967 --> 32:09.719
How much is Lillian offering?

32:12.807 --> 32:15.002
STONES HlT WlNDOW

32:24.927 --> 32:27.282
Lip, what the fuck you doing?!

32:27.327 --> 32:29.716

32:29.767 --> 32:33.442
lt would be if he turned up pissed
at 4am. Where's Jack?

32:33.487 --> 32:35.921
Still at the party.

32:35.967 --> 32:37.559
l had to see you.

32:37.607 --> 32:40.440
You make me so fucking horny.

32:40.487 --> 32:42.637
ls that what Romeo said to Juliet?

32:42.687 --> 32:44.996
Act four, scene five.

32:47.807 --> 32:49.877
(Wait there.)

33:14.447 --> 33:17.086
She's got two of 'em in there.

33:17.127 --> 33:19.322
You've a lot of catching up to do.

33:19.367 --> 33:21.085
BUZZlNG

33:27.607 --> 33:30.883
What a night! Party was brilliant!
Jack gets these Es -

33:30.927 --> 33:34.556
l've never had anything like 'em,
they make your knob tingle.

33:34.607 --> 33:36.325
You should come out sometime with us.

33:36.367 --> 33:37.641
He's a wanker!

33:37.687 --> 33:39.757
What the fuck you talking about?

33:39.807 --> 33:43.197
Look, he were the one that broke
into the shop, and beat Kash up.

33:43.247 --> 33:45.761
He were the one that stole
the housekeeping money!

33:45.807 --> 33:48.605
Don't try and stick up for him,
because l know it's right.

33:48.647 --> 33:51.207
- You don't even know him.
- Don't l?

33:51.247 --> 33:54.717
We've been at it like rabbits.
We've done it right there on the floor!

33:54.767 --> 33:56.519
And it's the best sex l've ever had.

33:56.567 --> 33:58.159
- You're lying.
- Ask him.

33:58.207 --> 34:00.163
You're fucking lying! He's straight.

34:00.207 --> 34:03.722
Didn't look very straight
when l was sucking his cock.

34:03.767 --> 34:08.283
He's greased us round with his flash car, cool
fucking life,

34:08.327 --> 34:11.558
and we've fallen for it
but who is he, Lip?

34:11.607 --> 34:13.165
Who the fuck have we let into our lives?

34:13.206 --> 34:16.324
He's not your fucking mate!
He's fuck all to do wi' you.

34:16.367 --> 34:20.280
All l wanted was something outside
this house, this fucking family!

34:20.327 --> 34:22.158
And you can't stand it, can you?

34:22.206 --> 34:23.925
You can't stand being left behind.

34:23.967 --> 34:26.275
lt's not about me, Lip.

34:26.327 --> 34:29.876
He's the best mate l've ever had.

34:29.927 --> 34:32.440
His sister's amazing.

34:32.487 --> 34:34.920
And you have to go
and interfere with it.

34:34.967 --> 34:36.559
Open your eyes. He's a cunt!

34:36.607 --> 34:39.074
You're the one that brought him
into this house

34:39.127 --> 34:42.085
so you're the one
that can get rid of him.

34:42.127 --> 34:45.244
Do you know what, lan?
That's not gonna happen.

35:07.887 --> 35:10.401
Got any plans for tonight?

35:10.447 --> 35:12.199
No, not really.
Why? What you offering?

35:12.247 --> 35:16.206
Me and Zoe are going local,
thought you could bring Claire along.

35:16.247 --> 35:17.965
Fucking foursome!

35:18.007 --> 35:20.760
You'll be arranging
dinner parties next.

35:20.807 --> 35:22.684
Actually, there'll be five of us.

35:22.727 --> 35:24.206
Bring your mate, Charlie.

35:27.127 --> 35:30.756
(Frank) No, no, Jesus fucking...
l'm trying to get ready.

35:30.807 --> 35:32.320
l need you to perform for me, Frank.

35:32.367 --> 35:34.961
(Frank) l'm fucking exhausted!

35:35.007 --> 35:37.919
You can't deny a woman her sexual needs!

35:37.967 --> 35:40.401
l'm in my prime.

35:40.447 --> 35:42.563
CRlES FROM NEXT DOOR

35:42.607 --> 35:43.801
What's happening?

35:43.847 --> 35:46.122
They're role playing.

35:46.167 --> 35:48.761
She's being a whore,
he's refusing to pay.

35:49.727 --> 35:52.161
She's calling him
all kinds of bastard.

35:54.047 --> 35:57.437
He's hitting her...
He's hitting her... He's hitting her.

35:59.567 --> 36:02.718
Oh, Frank, he really is hitting her.
Oh, God, Frank.

36:02.767 --> 36:04.997
Oh, God, Frank, no.
He's hitting her!

36:05.047 --> 36:08.403
Oh... Fucking hell, Sheila.

36:10.967 --> 36:12.844
Get up, and you get another one!

36:12.887 --> 36:16.721
Jesus, what sort of place is this?

36:16.767 --> 36:19.122
lt's just a normal family home.

36:19.167 --> 36:20.395
How much does he owe you?

36:20.447 --> 36:21.880
Er, fifty.

36:21.927 --> 36:23.360
Come on.

36:23.407 --> 36:25.284
Here.

36:25.327 --> 36:28.364
You'll need that as a deposit
on your next accommodation.

36:28.407 --> 36:30.796
Now get out. Go on.

36:43.807 --> 36:45.877
Without further ado,
let's welcome on stage the first act.

36:45.927 --> 36:47.724
lt's Wendy Wagstaff everyone!

36:48.527 --> 36:50.757
CHEERlNG

36:51.807 --> 36:54.719
(Kev) Wendy's a mother of six and her
interests are smoking, drinking

36:54.767 --> 36:58.806
and the work of Archimedes.
Er, Wendy, tell us who you're gonna be.

36:58.847 --> 37:03.204
Tonight, Kev,
l'm gonna be Britney Spears!

37:03.247 --> 37:06.603
Oh, baby baby...

37:06.647 --> 37:08.797
Jack, shout us one up, mate.

37:08.847 --> 37:10.678
What you having?
Same as you, please, mate.

37:10.727 --> 37:11.842
One of them, please.

37:16.087 --> 37:18.282
Something wasn't right here

37:18.327 --> 37:23.640
Oh, baby, baby,
l shouldn't have let you go

37:25.927 --> 37:28.361
Now you're out of sight, dear

37:28.407 --> 37:32.241
Show me how you want it to be...

37:33.927 --> 37:37.283
Sights you see
when you haven't got your gun.

37:37.327 --> 37:39.158
l'm a man of God!
l'd never do something like that!

37:39.207 --> 37:41.562
So is your Pope and he were a Nazi!

37:41.607 --> 37:44.758
Whatever my quarrel, l would never stoop to
the use of violence.

37:44.807 --> 37:48.595
that's where we're different. Now go on, fuck
off, before l feed you to t'lions.

37:48.647 --> 37:51.081
Yvonne! Yvonne.
He was nothing to do with it.

37:51.127 --> 37:53.163
lt was me.

37:53.207 --> 37:55.402
l've fucked up.

37:59.047 --> 38:00.526
l shagged someone else.

38:02.287 --> 38:04.278
One of Lip's mates...

38:04.327 --> 38:07.399
He stole my keys,
it was him that robbed you.

38:07.447 --> 38:10.245
lt was him that nearly killed you

38:10.287 --> 38:12.926
and l know you're both gonna hate me,

38:12.967 --> 38:16.880
but l never meant
for any of this to happen, l swear,

38:16.927 --> 38:20.442
and l wanted to tell you sooner
but he's Lip's mate

38:20.487 --> 38:22.955
and they're both in the pub now, laughing and
joking,

38:23.007 --> 38:26.397
like nothing ever happened...

38:26.447 --> 38:28.005
lt's my fault...

38:30.327 --> 38:33.046
lt's all my stupid fault...

38:33.087 --> 38:37.000
This isn't about me.
You two had better talk.

38:51.087 --> 38:53.760
The minute you walked in the joint

38:53.807 --> 38:57.197
l could feel you were
a man of distinction

38:57.247 --> 38:59.602
A real big arsehole

38:59.647 --> 39:02.923
Good-looking, so refined

39:02.967 --> 39:07.006
Say, wouldn't you like to know
what's going on in my mind?

39:07.047 --> 39:09.607
So let me get right to the point

39:09.647 --> 39:13.117
l don't pop my cork every guy l see

39:14.367 --> 39:16.039
Hey, big spender

39:18.167 --> 39:19.600
Spend

39:19.647 --> 39:22.115
A little time with me

39:25.727 --> 39:29.436
Wouldn't you like to have fun, fun, fun

39:29.487 --> 39:33.446
How's about a few laughs, laughs, laughs

39:33.487 --> 39:37.116
l can show you a good time

39:37.167 --> 39:40.603
Let me show you a...good time

39:41.447 --> 39:45.804
The minute you walked in the joint
l could see you were...

39:45.847 --> 39:48.077
Zoe! Zoe!

39:49.807 --> 39:51.843
What the fuck do you
think you're doing!

39:51.887 --> 39:53.036
What's Kash doing on this phone?

39:53.087 --> 39:54.839
What you on about, why?

39:54.887 --> 39:57.606
This isn't your phone. Where'd you get it? Did
Jack give it yer?

39:57.647 --> 39:59.558
- l'm saying nothing 'til you calm down.
- TELL ME!

40:00.687 --> 40:02.996
- He got it knock off. Why?
- Bastard!

40:03.047 --> 40:06.756
So he done some cunt for a phone,
fucking difference does it make?

40:17.167 --> 40:21.319
You bastard! Come on! You've ruined
everything. You fucking liar!

40:22.807 --> 40:26.595
Couldn't you have waited till after.
l'm reaching me crescendo here!

40:32.167 --> 40:34.601
What's he done,
tell me what the fuck he's done!

40:34.647 --> 40:37.241
- l'll tell ya.
- And who the hell are you?

40:37.287 --> 40:41.200
See him. He's the one
that broke into our shop.

40:41.247 --> 40:44.762
Left Kash for dead
and he'd do the same to any one of yer.

40:44.807 --> 40:46.399
You're a dead man.

40:49.247 --> 40:50.839
Lads.

41:02.607 --> 41:05.041
Shall l start again or what?

41:10.887 --> 41:13.037
lt were the first time, Kash, honest.

41:13.087 --> 41:16.841
There's never been anyone else and
there won't be again. lt's just...

41:16.887 --> 41:18.161
lan...

41:18.207 --> 41:21.438
No, l have to say it
because look at you!

41:21.487 --> 41:23.557
What he did.

41:23.607 --> 41:25.518
And that was my doing.

41:27.127 --> 41:31.723
Cos you're the best thing
that's ever happened to me.

41:33.487 --> 41:35.443
- l can't.
- Come here.

41:35.487 --> 41:37.478
l don't deserve yer.

41:41.807 --> 41:45.243
lf it hadn't been that guy,
it'd have been someone else.

41:45.287 --> 41:48.199
l made a mistake, that's all,

41:48.247 --> 41:51.205
just a stupid mistake.

41:51.247 --> 41:53.966
We always knew
it wouldn't last forever, lan.

41:54.007 --> 41:57.795
Nah, don't talk like that, Kash.

41:57.847 --> 42:02.762
Please, just don't talk like it's over.

42:05.007 --> 42:06.998
l've met someone else.

42:10.527 --> 42:11.596
Who is he?

42:11.647 --> 42:14.923
Does it matter? He's single. Older.

42:14.967 --> 42:17.117
He knows what he wants.

42:17.167 --> 42:19.317
Were you gonna fucking tell me?

42:21.207 --> 42:24.836
Harrogate - on last weekend.

42:57.007 --> 42:58.486
- Jesus!
- Mandy.

42:58.527 --> 43:00.916
You scared me half to death.

43:02.887 --> 43:04.479
- God, you're...
(Mandy) State of you.

43:06.047 --> 43:07.685
lt's gonna be a girl.

43:07.727 --> 43:10.036
Our little baby daughter.

43:10.087 --> 43:12.362
She's due start of next month.

43:14.567 --> 43:17.206
Can l touch her?

43:18.327 --> 43:20.158
Go on then. Be quick.

43:24.727 --> 43:28.037
Listen, my mum's on her way,
so you'd best not hang about.

43:30.247 --> 43:33.045
See you around, then.

43:34.607 --> 43:36.086
Good luck, yeah?

43:45.607 --> 43:49.600
(lan) 'Sometimes we get so wrapped up
in getting what we want

43:49.647 --> 43:53.162
'that we never really ask ourselves
why we wanted it in the first place.'

44:36.927 --> 44:39.805
Lip, they've robbed the shop!
Mandy Maguire's been taken to hospital.

44:39.847 --> 44:40.916
My daughter's been knocked down

44:40.967 --> 44:44.243
and someone's gonna get
a big fucking kicking for it.

44:44.287 --> 44:47.279
Take it from me,
this horse has already won.

44:47.327 --> 44:50.239
We'll get all the cash we can
and put it all on.

44:50.287 --> 44:52.721
Stay away from my daughter
and her baby.

45:35.527 --> 45:36.676
Are you the handyman?

45:36.727 --> 45:37.716
What is it you need fixing?

45:37.767 --> 45:39.723
l've written a list.

45:41.287 --> 45:43.801
Lillian recommended you.

45:45.527 --> 45:49.076
That all looks OK.
Will you be needing a quote?
