08:08.589 --> 08:09.990
- Hey, hey Kevin.

08:11.559 --> 08:12.793
How's it going?

08:17.297 --> 08:20.067
No, no, no, no, no,
I'm just getting ready.

08:20.100 --> 08:22.269
I'll be there in a minute.

08:27.575 --> 08:28.208
No.

08:29.342 --> 08:30.644
Look but I.

08:36.116 --> 08:37.116
Come on man.

08:39.186 --> 08:42.722
Look is there anything
I can do for you?

08:49.963 --> 08:50.798
Okay.

08:53.300 --> 08:56.069
Alright, thank
you for the offer.

09:00.641 --> 09:03.110
I appreciate that I really do.

09:14.988 --> 09:16.990
(sighs)

09:30.203 --> 09:32.706
(phone rings)

09:41.214 --> 09:42.382
- [Lindsey] Andrew.

09:42.415 --> 09:45.185
- [Andrew] Hey Lindsey,
is, is Zoe there?

09:45.218 --> 09:47.220
- [Lindsey] Yeah she's
getting ready for school.

09:47.254 --> 09:49.322
- [Andrew] I just wanted to
talk to her for a second.

09:49.356 --> 09:50.323
- [Lindsey] It's
not a good idea,

09:50.357 --> 09:52.125
I don't want her to be late.

09:52.159 --> 09:53.961
- [Andrew] I don't want her
to be late either, I just.

09:53.994 --> 09:55.362
- [Lindsey] Andrew, I
can't, I can't do this now.

09:55.395 --> 09:56.529
- [Andrew] What do you
mean, you can't do this now?

09:56.563 --> 09:58.265
Look I just want to talk to
my daughter for a second.

09:58.298 --> 09:59.266
- [Lindsey] Okay, we gotta go.

09:59.299 --> 10:01.001
Maybe, you know maybe
try back after school.

10:01.034 --> 10:02.369
- [Andrew] Lindsey!

10:02.402 --> 10:03.804
Don't hang up on.

10:30.397 --> 10:33.033
(horn honks)

10:39.106 --> 10:42.642
(unintelligible voices)

10:46.814 --> 10:49.316
(phone rings)

11:05.933 --> 11:08.902
- [Lindsey] Andrew,
your check didn't clear.

11:08.936 --> 11:11.371
You say you want to talk to
Zoe, but she doesn't need that.

11:11.404 --> 11:14.407
What she needs is for you to
pay the child support payments

11:14.441 --> 11:16.043
you're supposed to.

11:17.177 --> 11:19.346
I'm tired of having
this discussion

11:19.379 --> 11:21.715
and I'm tired of relying on you.

11:21.749 --> 11:25.719
If you want your daughter in
your life, pay what you owe.

11:36.529 --> 11:38.698
(screams)

11:39.166 --> 11:39.900
- Shh.

11:45.773 --> 11:48.041
(clinking)

12:23.576 --> 12:26.013
(thumping)

12:38.826 --> 12:40.427
- Wait, wait, wait.

12:41.394 --> 12:42.329
Wait, wait.

12:55.876 --> 12:56.509
I don't.

13:29.476 --> 13:31.912
(door slams)

13:33.246 --> 13:35.448
- That won't do us any good.

13:41.121 --> 13:42.022
- What's going on?

13:42.055 --> 13:42.956
- I don't know what's going on.

13:42.990 --> 13:44.224
I don't know how we got here.

13:44.257 --> 13:46.493
I don't know where here is.

13:55.468 --> 13:57.004
Get your feet okay?

13:57.037 --> 14:00.473
You never know how long
he's gonna be gone.

14:10.383 --> 14:11.584
We need to hurry.

14:28.535 --> 14:29.970
We need to hurry.

14:37.044 --> 14:38.445
- How are you here?

14:44.985 --> 14:46.886
- I woke up over there.

14:47.554 --> 14:49.222
I worked on my bonds all night.

14:49.256 --> 14:53.193
Lucky for me, not the other
girl, I was able to hide.

14:54.461 --> 14:56.496
- He forgot about you?

15:03.170 --> 15:06.106
(drawers slamming)

15:24.024 --> 15:26.493
(intense music)

15:36.169 --> 15:38.538

(glass breaking)

16:48.575 --> 16:50.543
(screams)

16:51.111 --> 16:52.579
- Is there any more back there?

16:52.612 --> 16:54.614
- Yeah, there's a couple pieces.

18:26.373 --> 18:28.841
(water running)

18:45.725 --> 18:47.894
(beeping)

19:01.241 --> 19:02.509
- [Spotter] Hello.

19:03.710 --> 19:07.180
- Uh yeah, I think I got
your package by mistake.

19:07.947 --> 19:10.217
- [Spotter] It wasn't a mistake.

19:10.250 --> 19:13.486
I was hoping you
would do a job for me.

19:16.456 --> 19:18.291
- I don't understand.

19:18.425 --> 19:20.260
- [Spotter] I have
a job for you.

19:20.293 --> 19:21.661
Are you interested?

19:22.962 --> 19:23.763
- What's the.

19:23.796 --> 19:25.265
- [Spotter] A delivery.

19:25.298 --> 19:27.567
If you can deliver
the package for me

19:27.600 --> 19:30.703
you earn another
two hundred dollars.

19:35.308 --> 19:38.311
- I'm sorry man,
I'm not a mailman.

19:39.346 --> 19:40.880
- [Spotter] Very well.

19:40.913 --> 19:42.649
No hard feelings huh.

19:44.284 --> 19:46.386
Listen, the amount that
you have is yours to keep.

19:46.419 --> 19:50.357
Just put the rest outside,
I take care of it.

19:55.428 --> 19:56.463
- What's in it?

19:57.430 --> 19:59.198
- [Spotter] Open it.

20:00.400 --> 20:02.469
- Look man, I don't want to get
involved in anything that's.

20:02.502 --> 20:05.672
- [Spotter] It's
nothing bad, open it.

20:47.414 --> 20:48.247
- Books?

20:48.815 --> 20:50.483
- [Spotter] That's all.

20:51.751 --> 20:53.520
- I don't understand why
you couldn't deliver this.

20:53.553 --> 20:56.055
- [Spotter] Look it's
hard to find good help.

20:56.088 --> 20:57.824
People you can trust.

20:59.426 --> 21:02.295
You just seem like a loyal
person that could use the help.

21:02.829 --> 21:03.996
- Is this a joke?

21:05.365 --> 21:07.934
- [Spotter] No, it's not
joke, is a job offer.

21:08.668 --> 21:09.902
Do you want the job?

21:11.804 --> 21:12.905
- Look, I just
don't understand why

21:12.939 --> 21:15.074
you couldn't deliver this.

21:15.107 --> 21:16.743
- [Spotter] I already told you.

21:16.776 --> 21:20.347
If you don't want the job,
you don't have to take it.

21:20.380 --> 21:21.848
Do you want the job?

21:22.715 --> 21:24.951
- You don't even know my name.

21:24.984 --> 21:27.420
- [Spotter] What's your name?

21:27.454 --> 21:28.287
- Andrew.

21:29.456 --> 21:32.425
- [Spotter] Do you
want the job Andrew?

21:37.430 --> 21:39.566
- Can I think about it?

21:40.500 --> 21:42.835
- [Spotter] Of course,
I'll be in touch.

22:14.701 --> 22:17.404
(phone rings)

22:38.591 --> 22:39.626
- Hello.

22:40.560 --> 22:43.630
- [Spotter] Do you
want the job, Andrew?

22:51.838 --> 22:52.639
- Yes.

22:52.672 --> 22:53.473
- [Spotter] Great.

22:53.506 --> 22:55.475
4437 Williamson Road.

22:56.609 --> 22:58.678
A package is outside
of your door.

22:58.711 --> 23:00.747
Half the payment is included.

23:00.780 --> 23:03.082
The remainder upon delivery.

23:04.484 --> 23:06.686
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
what about the other package?

23:06.719 --> 23:10.490
- [Spotter] Keep it, a
new one's at the door.

25:04.937 --> 25:07.607
(intense music)

25:37.970 --> 25:40.039
(grunts)

26:01.728 --> 26:03.830
(groans)

26:19.078 --> 26:21.180
(grunts)

27:56.976 --> 27:57.877
- Please.

27:58.344 --> 28:00.713
(grunts)

28:19.298 --> 28:21.300
(gasps)

28:45.958 --> 28:46.793
Help!

28:47.259 --> 28:48.027
Help!

28:49.061 --> 28:49.896
Please!

28:50.362 --> 28:51.130
Help!

30:29.328 --> 30:31.330
(moans)

30:45.044 --> 30:46.979
- I can't feel my legs.

30:59.291 --> 31:00.326
- Shh.

31:30.389 --> 31:32.458
(grunts)

32:36.355 --> 32:37.189
- Please.

34:00.706 --> 34:01.473
- Okay.

34:01.507 --> 34:03.575
(grunts)

34:26.431 --> 34:29.101
(door thumping)

34:32.438 --> 34:33.239
- Oh my God.

34:33.272 --> 34:34.340
Is that him?

34:34.373 --> 34:35.440
Oh my God, that's him.

34:35.474 --> 34:38.310
That's him, he's
going to kill us.

34:43.382 --> 34:44.550
He's going to kill us.

34:44.583 --> 34:45.417
Oh my God.

34:46.452 --> 34:47.853
What are you doing?

34:51.157 --> 34:52.524
What are you doing?

34:56.695 --> 34:58.530
Is that going to work?

34:59.398 --> 35:02.168
(door rattles)

35:16.415 --> 35:18.484
(grunts)

36:12.003 --> 36:12.838
- Come on!

36:14.740 --> 36:17.343
(door rattles)

36:32.424 --> 36:33.825
I'll pull you up.

36:34.360 --> 36:36.428
(grunts)

36:52.411 --> 36:55.347
(door rattling)

38:07.986 --> 38:08.820
- Hey!

38:09.655 --> 38:11.490
Please don't leave me.

38:20.499 --> 38:22.434
(sobs)

38:36.382 --> 38:39.050
(intense music)

39:24.563 --> 39:26.632
(grunts)

40:49.280 --> 40:51.483
(gasps)

41:28.887 --> 41:29.955
No, no, no.

42:04.690 --> 42:06.858
(screams)

42:44.262 --> 42:46.231
(gasping)

45:31.096 --> 45:33.765
(intense music)

48:39.384 --> 48:42.087
(phone rings)

48:47.625 --> 48:48.726
- [Announcer] Sir?

48:48.759 --> 48:50.095
- [Spotter] Hello, Andrew.

48:50.128 --> 48:51.129
How are you?

48:52.230 --> 48:54.032
- [Announcer] I'm doing
very well Sir, thank you.

48:54.065 --> 48:56.167
- [Spotter] Great and the
business with your daughter?

48:56.201 --> 48:59.270
- [Andrew] All taken care
of, can't thank you enough.

48:59.304 --> 49:00.305
- [Spotter] Good, good.

49:00.338 --> 49:02.107
If there's one thing we must do,

49:02.140 --> 49:04.075
it's take care of
our young women.

49:04.109 --> 49:06.444
- [Andrew] Yes Sir, is there
something I can do for you?

49:06.477 --> 49:08.579
- [Spotter] Now
that you ask, yes.

49:08.613 --> 49:12.150
I have an important delivery
I need taken care of.

49:12.183 --> 49:14.419
This one is somewhat critical,

49:14.452 --> 49:16.687
do you think you can handle it?

49:16.721 --> 49:18.389
- [Andrew] It
won't be a problem.

49:18.423 --> 49:21.492
- [Spotter] Be careful with
this one, it's very important.

49:21.526 --> 49:23.094
- [Andrew] Will do, Sir.

49:23.128 --> 49:24.295
- [Spotter] Andrew

49:24.329 --> 49:25.363
- [Andrew] Yes?

49:26.531 --> 49:28.166
- [Spotter] Do you want to
know what's in the package?

49:28.199 --> 49:30.101
- [Andrew] No, Sir I
don't need to know that.

49:30.135 --> 49:31.436
- [Spotter] Good man.

49:31.469 --> 49:34.172
It will be in the usual place.

49:40.211 --> 49:41.612
- Excuse me, Sir.

49:43.181 --> 49:45.316
I was wondering if you
could spare me some change?

49:45.350 --> 49:47.518
(screams)

49:49.587 --> 49:51.189
Come on let's go.

49:52.690 --> 49:55.293
(tires squeal)

50:00.598 --> 50:01.432
- Hello?

50:02.600 --> 50:04.102
- [Spotter] What
happened, Andrew?

50:04.135 --> 50:06.771
- Look, I got jumped but
don't worry about it.

50:06.804 --> 50:09.174
I will find them and
I will get it back.

50:09.207 --> 50:11.276
- [Spotter] I hope you
can fix this, Andrew.

50:11.309 --> 50:15.313
If not, I fear our business
will come to an end.

50:15.813 --> 50:16.647
- Hello?

50:17.715 --> 50:19.317
Hello, hello Sir?

50:21.186 --> 50:22.019
Fuck.

50:28.526 --> 50:31.229
(phone rings)

50:37.268 --> 50:38.603
- [Spotter] Yes.

50:42.207 --> 50:44.275
- I can't find them, Sir.

50:44.309 --> 50:45.143
I'm sorry.

50:46.010 --> 50:48.113
- [Spotter] It's
very disappointing.

50:48.146 --> 50:51.082
- I know, I can't
apologize enough.

50:52.283 --> 50:54.152
- [Spotter] Andrew, I
need someone dependable.

50:54.185 --> 50:57.222
Someone that will accomplish
the tasks they are given.

50:57.255 --> 50:58.856
- I can be that
person for you, Sir,

50:58.889 --> 51:00.425
I just need another chance.

51:00.458 --> 51:02.293
- [Spotter] I don't
think you understand.

51:02.327 --> 51:05.096
Finding true loyalty,
a person that will

51:05.130 --> 51:06.397
act without hesitation.

51:06.431 --> 51:10.335
That will not question
my guidance, that
is of value to me.

51:10.368 --> 51:13.638
- I can be that for
you, I know I can.

51:15.773 --> 51:18.209
- [Spotter] 170 Cherry Lane.

51:19.544 --> 51:21.379
The gate will be open.

51:22.747 --> 51:25.516
Make sure they
never do it again.

51:28.753 --> 51:30.321
- [Andrew] I will.

51:45.236 --> 51:46.271
- Woah!

51:49.474 --> 51:51.276
- Take it easy, man!

51:51.309 --> 51:52.177
It wasn't us!

51:52.810 --> 51:54.712
(grunting)

51:55.380 --> 51:57.448
(groans)

51:58.383 --> 52:00.518
(grunts)

52:24.975 --> 52:27.345
(gasping)

53:11.489 --> 53:13.658
(screams)

53:21.766 --> 53:23.768
(moans)

53:35.380 --> 53:37.548
(gasping)

55:14.379 --> 55:16.046
(groans)

55:33.097 --> 55:34.999
(grunts)

57:39.690 --> 57:42.159
(creaking wood)

57:54.539 --> 57:56.541
(gasps)

58:30.575 --> 58:32.677
(grunts)

59:45.315 --> 59:47.184
- [Andrew] I did it.

59:48.352 --> 59:51.188
- [Spotter] I have to say
Andrew I'm impressed, great job.

59:51.221 --> 59:52.990
- [Andrew] Thank you.

59:54.158 --> 59:55.059
- [Spotter] You
know what Andrew?

59:55.092 --> 59:57.227
I think it's time to
discuss your future.

59:57.261 --> 59:58.863
- [Andrew] What about it?

59:58.896 --> 01:00:00.330
- [Spotter] Well my employer
has been searching for

01:00:00.364 --> 01:00:02.767
sometime for a partner
that could take on more

01:00:02.800 --> 01:00:04.068
difficult tasks

01:00:05.135 --> 01:00:08.305
Tasks of a private
nature that require

01:00:09.874 --> 01:00:11.709
a certain sensitivity.

01:00:12.910 --> 01:00:14.078
- [Andrew] What
would I have to do?

01:00:14.111 --> 01:00:16.681
- [Spotter] I don't want to
get into that over the phone

01:00:16.714 --> 01:00:20.350
but it would be a step
up, easily six figures.

01:00:21.986 --> 01:00:24.722
More than enough to get
rid of all your problems.

01:00:25.422 --> 01:00:27.624
- [Andrew] I don't know.

01:00:28.092 --> 01:00:29.093
Why me?

01:00:30.327 --> 01:00:32.262
- [Spotter] You have proven
yourself in many ways, Andrew.

01:00:32.296 --> 01:00:35.265
Honestly I think
you'll be a good fit.

01:00:35.299 --> 01:00:37.101
Are you interested?

01:00:40.037 --> 01:00:41.706
- [Andrew] Yes.

01:00:41.739 --> 01:00:45.175
- [Spotter] Great, I will
arrange a car for you.

01:00:46.811 --> 01:00:49.279
My employer would like to talk
to you in person about it.

01:00:49.313 --> 01:00:52.316
A word of advice,
keep an open mind.

01:00:53.818 --> 01:00:55.119
- [Andrew] I will.

01:01:44.134 --> 01:01:46.904
(doorbell rings)

01:01:51.976 --> 01:01:55.746
(speaks in foreign language)

01:01:56.446 --> 01:01:58.315
- I'm here for a meeting.

01:02:53.103 --> 01:02:55.139
- The saucer as well.

01:03:41.418 --> 01:03:43.120
(speaks in foreign language)

01:03:43.153 --> 01:03:46.924
- No, that's all for
now, thank you, Bindu.

01:03:55.165 --> 01:03:57.334
Paul speaks highly of you.

01:03:58.936 --> 01:04:01.906
He say's you're faithful,
you can be trusted.

01:04:02.306 --> 01:04:03.340
Is that true?

01:04:05.009 --> 01:04:05.842
- Yes.

01:04:06.243 --> 01:04:07.244
- Sit down.

01:04:16.220 --> 01:04:18.122
What do you want, Andrew?

01:04:21.191 --> 01:04:25.162
Honestly, if you could have
anything, what would it be?

01:04:30.267 --> 01:04:33.170
- I would want a
better life for myself,

01:04:33.203 --> 01:04:35.072
be able to take
care of my family.

01:04:35.105 --> 01:04:37.207
- You mean your daughter.

01:04:38.242 --> 01:04:39.609
- Yes, my daughter.

01:04:41.245 --> 01:04:43.313
- She's your only family?

01:04:44.281 --> 01:04:45.115
- Yes.

01:04:46.216 --> 01:04:48.552
- What would you do for her?

01:04:53.223 --> 01:04:56.360
- I would buy her nice
things for school.

01:04:56.393 --> 01:04:59.163
Put money away for her college.

01:04:59.696 --> 01:05:01.331
- This is what you want?

01:05:01.365 --> 01:05:02.199
- Yes.

01:05:03.333 --> 01:05:05.502
- No, this is what
you need, not want.

01:05:08.072 --> 01:05:12.242
You need to take care of her,
you need to provide for her.

01:05:13.410 --> 01:05:15.212
The difference between
want and need is one

01:05:15.245 --> 01:05:17.414
not many people understand.

01:05:17.447 --> 01:05:21.151
What you want is to give
her the kind of life

01:05:21.185 --> 01:05:23.187
that most only dream of.

01:05:24.221 --> 01:05:25.155
Am I right?

01:05:27.257 --> 01:05:28.092
- Yes.

01:05:29.159 --> 01:05:30.627
- You see the difference?

01:05:36.100 --> 01:05:36.933
- I do.

01:05:47.077 --> 01:05:48.045
Why am I here?

01:05:50.080 --> 01:05:52.449
- Won't you ask me what I want?

01:05:56.353 --> 01:05:58.155
- What do you want?

01:05:59.489 --> 01:06:01.091
- So many things.

01:06:06.263 --> 01:06:10.434
I want my husband to have
survived that silly war,

01:06:12.202 --> 01:06:16.173
but death is a part of life
and we will all face it.

01:06:17.107 --> 01:06:18.142
I want to feel safe,

01:06:19.776 --> 01:06:23.447
I want to feel like the
world isn't controlling me

01:06:24.448 --> 01:06:25.982
but it's a fight

01:06:26.483 --> 01:06:28.418
Time is not on my side.

01:06:30.354 --> 01:06:34.524
I want the years that were
taken from me while he was gone,

01:06:37.227 --> 01:06:38.995
but time is fickle.

01:06:40.164 --> 01:06:42.666
Youth and age do not
walk hand in hand.

01:06:45.102 --> 01:06:48.172
But there is something
that can be done

01:06:50.240 --> 01:06:53.243
and I need someone
to help me do it.

01:06:56.480 --> 01:06:58.415
That's why you're here.

01:06:59.349 --> 01:07:01.151
- What do you need?

01:07:03.620 --> 01:07:07.791
- I will always remember my
husband just as he left me.

01:07:10.160 --> 01:07:14.331
He will never age and for some
that's the best they could

01:07:15.765 --> 01:07:19.536
ever ask for, to always be
that person, at their best,

01:07:23.140 --> 01:07:25.475
even if it's only in memory.

01:07:28.345 --> 01:07:31.681
However, the rest of
us aren't so lucky.

01:07:33.150 --> 01:07:36.253
Our faults will only magnify
until we are unrecognizable.

01:07:40.524 --> 01:07:44.694
Who would know it's us, once
time has run its course?

01:07:46.130 --> 01:07:47.131
- I'm sorry.

01:07:47.897 --> 01:07:49.099
- Elizabeth.

01:07:50.300 --> 01:07:53.337
- Elizabeth, but I don't know
what we're talking about.

01:07:56.206 --> 01:07:59.209
- We're talking
about youth, Andrew.

01:08:00.377 --> 01:08:02.679
Keeping that which is yours.

01:08:04.214 --> 01:08:08.285
Striking the uncertainty
of ageing from its hold.

01:08:08.752 --> 01:08:09.553
- How?

01:08:10.720 --> 01:08:12.256
- I found a way,

01:08:13.790 --> 01:08:17.361
but it requires a
certain kind of skillset.

01:08:23.933 --> 01:08:26.270
- What do you want me to do?

01:08:27.404 --> 01:08:30.640
- It's not what I want
you to do, Andrew,

01:08:31.475 --> 01:08:32.742
it's what you need to do.

01:08:34.778 --> 01:08:35.845
- What is it?

01:08:37.214 --> 01:08:39.149
- I will provide
specimens for you.

01:08:40.317 --> 01:08:42.352
- [Andrew] What specimens?

01:08:42.386 --> 01:08:43.587
- Young women.

01:08:44.787 --> 01:08:48.124
And you will extract
their blood for me.

01:08:49.225 --> 01:08:50.859
- Extract their blood?

01:08:50.894 --> 01:08:53.563
- But only the freshest will do.

01:08:55.865 --> 01:08:57.100
- I don't understand.

01:08:57.133 --> 01:09:01.638
- You will do this because it
is the most fitting end to the

01:09:02.439 --> 01:09:04.174
lives of these girls.

01:09:05.675 --> 01:09:07.944
They will always be
remembered as they are,

01:09:07.977 --> 01:09:09.645
young and beautiful.

01:09:10.846 --> 01:09:13.483
Their youth will be
carried forward in

01:09:13.517 --> 01:09:15.885
the memories of their families.

01:09:16.986 --> 01:09:17.821
- I can't.

01:09:18.955 --> 01:09:22.692
- You will do this because
I'm owed it for the youth

01:09:24.261 --> 01:09:26.830
that was taken
from me years ago.

01:09:36.240 --> 01:09:37.941
How old is your daughter?

01:09:46.783 --> 01:09:47.617
- 14.

01:09:49.953 --> 01:09:52.256
- What a wonderful age.

01:09:54.491 --> 01:09:58.262
One that should be
savored, wouldn't you say?

01:10:04.968 --> 01:10:08.938
You will do this because your
daughter will want for nothing

01:10:09.939 --> 01:10:12.208
for the rest of her life.

01:10:13.910 --> 01:10:15.945
She will be akin to royalty

01:10:18.047 --> 01:10:20.884
and she'll have you
to thank for it.

01:10:20.917 --> 01:10:25.289
You yourself will be given the
life you've always deserved.

01:10:26.423 --> 01:10:29.693
Or we can go back to
where you started?

01:10:34.798 --> 01:10:36.900
- Where do all the
girls come from?

01:10:36.933 --> 01:10:38.001
- Everywhere.

01:10:39.436 --> 01:10:41.938
- Why haven't you been caught?

01:10:43.373 --> 01:10:47.377
- Wealth affords many
things, as you will learn.

01:10:57.721 --> 01:11:00.424
(intense music)

01:11:02.392 --> 01:11:04.394
(gasps)

01:11:11.368 --> 01:11:13.770
(door slams)

01:11:15.071 --> 01:11:17.741
(intense music)

01:11:46.636 --> 01:11:48.805
(screams)

01:11:49.773 --> 01:11:53.042
(gasping and coughing)

01:11:56.112 --> 01:11:58.982
(intense music)

01:12:11.561 --> 01:12:13.730
(screams)

01:12:17.567 --> 01:12:19.736
(gasping)

01:12:20.136 --> 01:12:22.406
(grunts)

01:12:24.073 --> 01:12:26.910
(heavy breathing)

01:12:28.812 --> 01:12:30.880
(grunts)

01:13:26.836 --> 01:13:28.838
(gasps)

01:13:58.267 --> 01:14:00.570
(grunts)

01:14:32.802 --> 01:14:35.639
(heavy breathing)

01:15:36.032 --> 01:15:38.101
(grunts)

01:15:49.679 --> 01:15:52.148
(intense music)

01:16:42.331 --> 01:16:46.703
- [Elizabeth] Wealth affords
many things, as you will learn.

01:16:49.973 --> 01:16:52.976
- How much time do
I have to decide?

01:16:54.978 --> 01:16:56.713
- Are you interested?

01:17:00.750 --> 01:17:01.350
- Yes.

01:17:02.218 --> 01:17:05.321
- Perfect, a vacancy
just opened up.

01:17:11.260 --> 01:17:13.930
(intense music)

01:18:16.092 --> 01:18:19.062
(birds chirping)

01:18:33.509 --> 01:18:36.445
(mysterious music)
