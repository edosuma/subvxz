WEBVTT

00:01.369 --> 00:03.504
NARRATOR: Tonight on
The Curse of Oak Island...

00:03.537 --> 00:05.373
Oh.

00:05.406 --> 00:08.676
It's bone with some soft tissue
on it and hairs.

00:08.709 --> 00:10.378
Is it human?

00:10.411 --> 00:11.745
-Are you getting readings?
-MIKE: Yeah.

00:11.779 --> 00:13.347
CRAIG: Picking something else
up right here.

00:13.381 --> 00:14.515
MIKE: There's a pretty good
upswing there.

00:14.548 --> 00:16.517
MARTY:
What do you make of that?

00:16.550 --> 00:19.487
In H-8 there is definitely
an anomaly.

00:19.520 --> 00:21.555
I think we found the Money Pit.

00:21.589 --> 00:23.324
-(both laughing)
-Yes!

00:23.357 --> 00:25.359
We now have results
from the two bones.

00:25.393 --> 00:28.062
Both came back as human.

00:31.499 --> 00:35.203
NARRATOR: There is an island
in the North Atlantic

00:35.236 --> 00:38.372
where people have been looking
for an incredible treasure

00:38.406 --> 00:41.709
for more than 200 years.

00:41.742 --> 00:45.479
So far, they have found
bits of gold chain,

00:45.513 --> 00:49.583
a stone slab with strange
symbols carved into it...

00:49.617 --> 00:52.820
even a 17th century
Spanish coin.

00:52.853 --> 00:55.256
To date, six men have died

00:55.289 --> 00:57.591
trying to solve the mystery.

00:57.625 --> 01:00.194
And, according to legend,

01:00.228 --> 01:03.364
one more will have to die

01:03.397 --> 01:06.500
before the treasure
can be found.

01:19.447 --> 01:22.683
In the 11 years since
brothers Rick and Marty Lagina

01:22.716 --> 01:25.786
began their search for treasure
on Oak Island,

01:25.819 --> 01:27.755
they may now be closer
than ever

01:27.788 --> 01:31.525
to solving
a 222-year-old mystery.

01:31.559 --> 01:33.861
-Morning, Terry.
-TERRY: Hi.

01:33.894 --> 01:39.133
-Where are we right now? -Uh,
we're down to, uh, 210 to 215.

01:39.167 --> 01:41.669
215. Is it going
a little quicker?

01:41.702 --> 01:43.571
A little bit.

01:43.604 --> 01:46.374
I would say the-the rain
slowed things down.

01:48.576 --> 01:50.878
NARRATOR:
Last week, in their quest

01:50.911 --> 01:53.881
to locate the site
of the original Money Pit,

01:53.914 --> 01:59.287
the team found a mysterious
object at a depth of 192 feet

01:59.320 --> 02:02.156
in a borehole labeled "H-8."

02:02.190 --> 02:03.457
RICK:
Glazed pottery.

02:03.491 --> 02:04.692
-DAVE: Pottery?
-RICK: Yeah, yeah.

02:04.725 --> 02:06.494
How did we get pottery
at 190 feet?

02:06.527 --> 02:08.529
That's confounding.

02:08.562 --> 02:10.864
NARRATOR: But, in addition
to the fragments of pottery,

02:10.898 --> 02:12.866
they also discovered evidence

02:12.900 --> 02:15.403
of something even more
confounding.

02:15.436 --> 02:16.937
What is that?

02:16.970 --> 02:18.672
NARRATOR:
Something that, if true,

02:18.706 --> 02:20.941
could change their exploration
in the Money Pit

02:20.974 --> 02:23.177
in a profound way.

02:23.211 --> 02:25.279
My immediate reaction
is it's bone.

02:25.313 --> 02:26.447
MARTY:
Holy smokes.

02:28.516 --> 02:30.851
NARRATOR:
Now, as the team continues

02:30.884 --> 02:33.554
to drill at the H-8 site...

02:33.587 --> 02:35.789
JACK: This is gonna take
a little while.

02:35.823 --> 02:38.692
DAN H.:
Let's find something important.

02:38.726 --> 02:41.329
...treasure hunters
Jack Begley and Dan Henskee

02:41.362 --> 02:44.365
continue to carefully sift
through the spoils

02:44.398 --> 02:47.901
in hopes of turning up
even more remarkable evidence

02:47.935 --> 02:50.971
of human activity.

02:51.004 --> 02:54.275
Well, I can't compin that
you're not checking in detail.

02:54.308 --> 02:56.244
JACK: Well, hopefully
we can find more pottery,

02:56.277 --> 02:59.480
which we have found already and
anything else that stands out.

02:59.513 --> 03:01.215
Yeah.

03:01.249 --> 03:03.251
If I'm able to discover anything

03:03.284 --> 03:05.219
that can be properly analyzed,

03:05.253 --> 03:07.588
it's gonna make going through

03:07.621 --> 03:11.592
this massive spoil pile
well worth it.

03:11.625 --> 03:16.297
But it's one bucket at a time,
we got to go through all of it.

03:16.330 --> 03:20.434
There's a piece of anhydrite,
I bet.

03:20.468 --> 03:22.970
Yeah, nice one, actually.

03:23.003 --> 03:25.739
NARRATOR: With the possible
exception of Dan Blankenship,

03:25.773 --> 03:28.576
Dan Henskee knows more
about Oak Island

03:28.609 --> 03:31.379
than anyone else in the world.

03:31.412 --> 03:34.548
After helping Dan
and his son, Dave,

03:34.582 --> 03:37.918
dig Borehole 10-X in the 1970s,

03:37.951 --> 03:40.854
he has continued to make
the search for treasure

03:40.888 --> 03:44.358
his lifelong quest
and, in so doing,

03:44.392 --> 03:46.860
brings a wealth of experience
to the team.

03:49.062 --> 03:51.565
That one more piece there,
I'm thinking.

03:51.599 --> 03:54.468
JACK: This? Oh, yeah.
Oh, yeah, that's...

03:54.502 --> 03:57.371
-Anyway, I'll sit this down.
-You have better eyes then I do.

03:57.405 --> 03:59.773
-Oh, not really.
-Yeah.

03:59.807 --> 04:02.242
It's all in looking
at the right place.

04:04.345 --> 04:07.014
JACK:
Yes.

04:07.047 --> 04:08.982
Dan, come here.

04:09.016 --> 04:12.786
I think I found
a piece of pottery.

04:12.820 --> 04:15.489
DAN H.:
I have a pottery bag.

04:15.523 --> 04:18.058
JACK: You know, this is
enough of a design,

04:18.091 --> 04:20.994
I wonder if it's identifiable.

04:21.028 --> 04:22.963
I think an expert will be able
to tell, though.

04:22.996 --> 04:25.566
That does actually look
pretty significant.

04:25.599 --> 04:27.801
There you go.

04:27.835 --> 04:29.603
Maybe we'll get more today,
I don't know.

04:29.637 --> 04:30.938
-Yeah. -I'll put it
with the other stuff.

04:30.971 --> 04:32.773
All right, I'll keep looking.

04:46.086 --> 04:48.889
All right, here's
what kind of confuses me.

04:48.922 --> 04:50.924
What do you make
of that piece of wood?

04:50.958 --> 04:53.026
Oh, kindling?

04:53.060 --> 04:56.464
Yeah, that-that pattern
is very strange.

04:56.497 --> 04:59.433
It's random and yet
it looks manufactured.

04:59.467 --> 05:00.901
You know it looks artificial.

05:00.934 --> 05:03.704
I just don't know what
it's supposed to be.

05:03.737 --> 05:05.573
JACK: Well, let's put this
in a special bag then.

05:05.606 --> 05:07.475
DAN H.:
All right.

05:13.681 --> 05:16.049
-Hey, guys.
-JACK: Oh, hey.

05:16.083 --> 05:18.652
Dan and I have some stuff
to show you

05:18.686 --> 05:21.021
that we found
from the H-8 spoils.

05:21.054 --> 05:23.357
Okay. I will say this,

05:23.391 --> 05:25.926
you guys look almost as washed
as your specimens.

05:25.959 --> 05:28.729
(laughs)
Right back at you.

05:28.762 --> 05:30.731
Whatever you've got to show,
let-let's get dry,

05:30.764 --> 05:32.666
and let's get in the museum
and take a look at it.

05:32.700 --> 05:34.602
-All right. I got to grab
the other bags, okay? -Okay.

05:34.635 --> 05:36.870
RICK: Jack and Dan have done
a very proper job

05:36.904 --> 05:40.808
of creating a wash table and
washing these spoils from H-8.

05:40.841 --> 05:44.845
It's been a long process,
it's taken them a lot of time,

05:44.878 --> 05:47.981
and they've spent a lot
of hours going through them.

05:48.015 --> 05:50.050
So, I give Jack and Dan
a lot of credit

05:50.083 --> 05:53.454
for taking the initiative
to wash these things

05:53.487 --> 05:56.724
and spend the amount of time,
the hours going through them,

05:56.757 --> 05:59.960
and it's been painstaking work.

05:59.993 --> 06:02.062
And where do I start? Um...

06:02.095 --> 06:03.697
You guys found it,
you guys looked at it,

06:03.731 --> 06:06.500
you tell us which one
you find intriguing.

06:06.534 --> 06:09.737
JACK:
Tell me what you think of this.

06:09.770 --> 06:11.572
CHARLES:
That's very interesting.

06:13.807 --> 06:15.809
RICK: That was the only piece
you found like that?

06:15.843 --> 06:17.611
JACK:
So far, yeah.

06:17.645 --> 06:19.046
RICK: That looks
significantly different

06:19.079 --> 06:21.582
than any pattern
we've found to date.

06:21.615 --> 06:23.651
Now, Laird might be able
to give us an opinion,

06:23.684 --> 06:27.154
but I would definitely
get that one tested.

06:27.187 --> 06:29.590
-JACK: Yeah, never seen that
artwork before. -Never. Never.

06:29.623 --> 06:31.058
Yeah.

06:31.091 --> 06:32.826
RICK:
It's an interesting find

06:32.860 --> 06:34.795
because lots of pottery has been
found over the years,

06:34.828 --> 06:37.030
lots of pottery and ceramic.

06:37.064 --> 06:39.933
This is distinctly
and decidedly different.

06:39.967 --> 06:41.735
It might be old.

06:41.769 --> 06:44.037
CHARLES:
So, what else you got, Jack?

06:44.071 --> 06:48.776
-Okay, next is, um, mystery
object. -Mystery... Yeah, yeah.

06:48.809 --> 06:51.812
JACK: We don't know
exactly what this is.

06:51.845 --> 06:54.682
I-I think it's a piece of wood,
but I'm not exactly sure.

06:54.715 --> 06:57.818
Yeah, it's a very unusual
pattern on that.

06:57.851 --> 06:59.787
-CHARLES: Got some weight to it,
don't it? -DAN H.: Yeah.

06:59.820 --> 07:01.622
It is unlike any other piece
of wood that was seen...

07:01.655 --> 07:03.624
DAN H.:
I've never seen anything...

07:03.657 --> 07:07.795
yeah, I've never seen anything
that had that odd pattern to it.

07:07.828 --> 07:10.464
CHARLES: It is weird,
there's no question about that.

07:10.498 --> 07:13.734
But it does look
like bark to me.

07:13.767 --> 07:15.736
RICK:
I have no idea what that is.

07:15.769 --> 07:17.771
CHARLES:
That is, that is very strange.

07:17.805 --> 07:20.508
-It almost looks artificial.
-DAN H.: Yeah.

07:20.541 --> 07:23.544
Yeah, it looks like artwork,
not n-nature's work.

07:23.577 --> 07:27.214
RICK: But then the back
looks like it has grain.

07:27.247 --> 07:29.016
-See that?
-Let me see.

07:31.184 --> 07:33.787
Yeah, it does have
some grain to it.

07:33.821 --> 07:36.857
That is very intriguing, Jack.

07:36.890 --> 07:39.527
Great find, guys.

07:39.560 --> 07:41.094
RICK: It's the perfect thing
that needs to be run

07:41.128 --> 07:42.830
through the scanning
electron microscope.

07:42.863 --> 07:44.732
JACK:
Exactly.

07:44.765 --> 07:48.068
And we should bring that
to Dr. Brosseau and Dr. Yang

07:48.101 --> 07:49.803
at-at St. Mary's.

07:49.837 --> 07:51.805
Awesome, well, I-I'd also like

07:51.839 --> 07:53.841
to go through some
of the other spoil piles.

07:53.874 --> 07:55.709
No question about it,
given-given what you've found,

07:55.743 --> 07:59.547
we'd be foolish not to avail
ourselves of that process.

07:59.580 --> 08:01.815
-Look, kudos to you guys...
-Yeah.

08:01.849 --> 08:04.785
...for making these finds,
but at the end of the day,

08:04.818 --> 08:07.287
-we need some testing done.
So... -Mm-hmm. -Yeah.

08:07.320 --> 08:09.189
-RICK: Good job.
-JACK: Thanks.

08:09.222 --> 08:11.525
-RICK: All right. Very good day.
-CHARLES: Let's go.

08:19.199 --> 08:21.301
NARRATOR: One day after finding
additional evidence

08:21.334 --> 08:24.304
of man-made materials
in Borehole H-8,

08:24.337 --> 08:26.540
Rick and Marty Lagina,

08:26.574 --> 08:28.976
along with their partner,
Craig Tester,

08:29.009 --> 08:31.311
have traveled
some 50 miles northeast

08:31.344 --> 08:36.216
to St. Mary's University
in the city of Halifax.

08:36.249 --> 08:39.620
They are eager to get the
results of laboratory testing

08:39.653 --> 08:42.656
on the object that
archaeologist Laird Niven

08:42.690 --> 08:44.925
identified as bone,

08:44.958 --> 08:46.894
along with the strange piece
of wood

08:46.927 --> 08:50.664
that was found in Borehole H-8.

08:50.698 --> 08:52.833
-Good to see you again.
-Welcome back.

08:52.866 --> 08:54.702
What did you bring today?

08:54.735 --> 08:56.069
We've got some
interesting stuff.

08:56.103 --> 08:57.270
-Nice to see you again.
-Nice seeing you.

08:57.304 --> 08:59.039
NARRATOR:
Dr. Christa Brosseau

08:59.072 --> 09:01.074
is an associate professor
of chemistry

09:01.108 --> 09:03.944
and an expert
in the compositional makeup

09:03.977 --> 09:06.747
of both metals
and organic materials.

09:06.780 --> 09:08.616
These samples, actually,

09:08.649 --> 09:11.619
are all from a-a hole
we find very interesting.

09:11.652 --> 09:16.924
-And this item came from 160
to 165 feet down. -Okay.

09:16.957 --> 09:19.126
Which is interesting
because we really thought

09:19.159 --> 09:21.261
that this would be
totally undisturbed,

09:21.294 --> 09:23.797
-you know, in situ stuff.
-Right.

09:23.831 --> 09:25.198
And for this to come out
is really odd,

09:25.232 --> 09:26.967
so we'd like to look at that.

09:27.000 --> 09:29.202
We don't know what it is.

09:29.236 --> 09:31.071
Uh, there's conjecture

09:31.104 --> 09:35.609
that it's a real dense wood,
Lignum vitae.

09:35.643 --> 09:38.812
I don't think so. There's
conjecture that it's bone.

09:38.846 --> 09:41.749
The thing is we've pulled up
lots and lots of wood.

09:41.782 --> 09:44.184
Nothing like that has ever
come to surface.

09:44.217 --> 09:46.787
-So, this is our highest
priority. -Okay.

09:46.820 --> 09:48.155
MARTY: What was the other thing
here, though, before,

09:48.188 --> 09:49.690
we had two things here, right?

09:49.723 --> 09:51.291
That also is H-8.

09:51.324 --> 09:54.728
We have no idea what it is.

09:54.762 --> 09:56.797
RICK:
The grain effect on that piece.

09:56.830 --> 09:58.165
CHRISTA: Yeah, that's kind of
interesting, right?

09:58.198 --> 10:01.802
Has an interesting pattern
on it.

10:01.835 --> 10:04.104
Okay.

10:04.137 --> 10:07.407
Wood versus bone should be easy
to figure out today.

10:07.440 --> 10:09.677
Okay, so these samples
are ready.

10:09.710 --> 10:12.680
So, we can head downstairs.

10:15.983 --> 10:19.920
Is this odd thing
bone or is it wood?

10:19.953 --> 10:23.056
Either one, actually,
is of interest.

10:23.090 --> 10:26.026
Hello, Dr. Yang.
How are you doing?

10:26.059 --> 10:28.295
NARRATOR: Working with her
colleague, Dr. Xiang Yang,

10:28.328 --> 10:31.699
Dr. Brosseau will examine
the two specimens

10:31.732 --> 10:33.834
with the help of a high-powered

10:33.867 --> 10:37.705
scanning electron microscope,
or SEM.

10:37.738 --> 10:40.841
The SEM works
by scanning an object

10:40.874 --> 10:43.376
with a focused beam
of electrons.

10:43.410 --> 10:45.813
When the electron beam
interacts

10:45.846 --> 10:49.983
with the atoms of a specimen,
the energy lost by the process

10:50.017 --> 10:53.754
produces signals that can
magnify images of the specimen

10:53.787 --> 10:56.824
by an estimated
200,000 times larger

10:56.857 --> 11:00.193
than those created
by a traditional microscope.

11:00.227 --> 11:05.165
It can also provide a detailed
compositional analysis.

11:05.198 --> 11:08.435
So, the first thing we'll do
is elemental analysis

11:08.468 --> 11:10.437
to figure out
what the hard substance is.

11:10.470 --> 11:14.107
You had thought it might be wood
or possibly bone,

11:14.141 --> 11:18.245
so that will be easy to tell
by elemental analysis.

11:33.060 --> 11:35.462
What does that mean?

11:35.495 --> 11:36.764
-XIANG: It's bone.
-It's bone.

11:41.368 --> 11:42.502
Really?

11:42.535 --> 11:44.104
-Yes.
-Yeah.

11:44.137 --> 11:47.274
NARRATOR:
At St. Mary's University

11:47.307 --> 11:49.977
in Halifax, Nova Scotia,

11:50.010 --> 11:53.814
Rick and Marty Lagina,
along with Craig Tester,

11:53.847 --> 11:56.149
have just received confirmation

11:56.183 --> 11:59.286
that the mysterious object
found one week ago

11:59.319 --> 12:04.324
in Borehole H-8 is, in fact,
a piece of bone.

12:04.357 --> 12:06.093
Are you certain?

12:06.126 --> 12:07.828
A piece of bone. Yes.

12:07.861 --> 12:10.030
RICK:
That's absolutely definitive.

12:10.063 --> 12:12.933
CHRISTA:
That looks like bone, yeah.

12:12.966 --> 12:16.336
NARRATOR: Because the powerful
scanning electron microscope

12:16.369 --> 12:19.006
detected the presence
of calcium phosphate,

12:19.039 --> 12:21.374
instead of lignin
or carbohydrates,

12:21.408 --> 12:24.377
Doctors Brosseau and Yang
are confident

12:24.411 --> 12:26.546
that the specimen
the Oak Island team found

12:26.579 --> 12:30.150
in Borehole H-8
is unquestionably bone.

12:30.183 --> 12:33.854
But whether the bone is from
an animal-- or a human--

12:33.887 --> 12:36.957
will require DNA analysis.

12:36.990 --> 12:41.561
A piece of bone comes out
of a hole 160 feet underground.

12:41.594 --> 12:44.464
What is it? A mastodon?

12:44.497 --> 12:45.833
(laughter)

12:47.400 --> 12:48.802
All right.

12:48.836 --> 12:51.104
Next sample.

12:51.138 --> 12:54.808
So, this is a piece
of the hard sample.

12:54.842 --> 12:56.009
Where did this piece come from?

12:56.043 --> 12:57.878
Same hole.

12:57.911 --> 13:01.181
CHRISTA: So you can see
the elements popping up there.

13:03.383 --> 13:06.954
So, here we see calcium
phosphate pop up right away.

13:06.987 --> 13:08.388
So this is a piece of bone.

13:11.058 --> 13:13.927
NARRATOR:
A second bone?

13:13.961 --> 13:15.996
But if another piece of bone

13:16.029 --> 13:18.932
has also been found
in Borehole H-8,

13:18.966 --> 13:22.069
why do the two samples appear
so different?

13:22.102 --> 13:23.904
CHRISTA:
It's interesting looking.

13:23.937 --> 13:26.406
NARRATOR: Could they be
from two different animals?

13:26.439 --> 13:29.442
Or two different human beings?

13:29.476 --> 13:31.444
CHRISTA:
I see layers on the surface,

13:31.478 --> 13:34.948
so piece of bone with some
soft tissue on it, still.

13:34.982 --> 13:39.386
I also see hairs
in the soft material.

13:39.419 --> 13:41.955
-And hair?
-And hair.

13:41.989 --> 13:44.291
NARRATOR:
Tissue and hair?

13:44.324 --> 13:47.895
But could tissue and hair
still be attached to bone,

13:47.928 --> 13:50.463
after decades
deep below ground?

13:50.497 --> 13:54.067
And, if so, will
they reveal anything

13:54.101 --> 13:56.970
about what-- or whom--
lies buried

13:57.004 --> 13:59.639
in the area
of the Oak Island Money Pit?

13:59.672 --> 14:01.374
To me, the hair looks like

14:01.408 --> 14:04.277
they're a fair distance apart
from each other.

14:04.311 --> 14:05.879
-Yeah.
-More likely you'd think

14:05.913 --> 14:10.317
of skin, as opposed to animal.

14:10.350 --> 14:12.219
That's weird,
but this has skin on it.

14:12.252 --> 14:14.654
Well, some kind of tissue;
could be fat.

14:14.687 --> 14:18.158
Yeah, it's quite gross.

14:18.191 --> 14:21.261
The little piece of bone
with the skin on it is creepy.

14:21.294 --> 14:22.662
RICK:
To see the hair follicles.

14:22.695 --> 14:24.497
Yeah, ugh.

14:24.531 --> 14:26.967
You know, right now,
it's just weird.

14:27.000 --> 14:28.501
If it turns out to be human,

14:28.535 --> 14:31.238
I guess we've got
another mystery to solve.

14:32.539 --> 14:34.107
RICK:
If it really is skin,

14:34.141 --> 14:36.910
surely they could extract DNA,
you would think.

14:36.944 --> 14:40.080
It wouldn't be degraded enough
for that not to be possible.

14:40.113 --> 14:41.949
Yeah.

14:41.982 --> 14:44.384
You can carbon-date bone,
I think you can, perhaps,

14:44.417 --> 14:46.486
genetically test bone.

14:46.519 --> 14:50.090
Who knows where that trail
of information leads?

14:50.123 --> 14:52.926
This is an odd search.

15:01.001 --> 15:03.503
NARRATOR:
As Rick, Marty and Craig

15:03.536 --> 15:05.338
conclude today's search
for answers

15:05.372 --> 15:07.340
at St. Mary's University...

15:07.374 --> 15:09.242
JACK:
Well, let's get started.

15:09.276 --> 15:12.245
...Jack Begley
and Dan Henskee continue

15:12.279 --> 15:15.515
their painstaking search
of the Borehole H-8 spoils

15:15.548 --> 15:16.649
for more evidence.

15:20.187 --> 15:22.055
-Oh, I need your eyes, Dan.
-Yeah.

15:22.089 --> 15:24.457
Well, I got them today.

15:24.491 --> 15:25.725
From everything that I found

15:25.758 --> 15:27.995
going through
the H-8 spoil pile,

15:28.028 --> 15:29.696
I didn't think I was gonna
be this successful.

15:29.729 --> 15:32.032
I'm really happy
at the results.

15:32.065 --> 15:34.968
And it's only proof to me
and the rest of the team

15:35.002 --> 15:37.737
that there's more clues
to be found.

15:37.770 --> 15:39.706
Oh. What do you think this is?

15:39.739 --> 15:41.574
I don't know.

15:41.608 --> 15:43.076
Yeah.

15:43.110 --> 15:45.378
It, uh, seems to be cut here.

15:45.412 --> 15:47.147
JACK: Mm-hmm.
So, it's not natural, I'd say.

15:47.180 --> 15:49.249
DAN H.:
Yeah.

15:49.282 --> 15:53.053
It's about the right thickness,
uh, for shoe leather actually.

15:53.086 --> 15:57.590
It's got an interesting
surface pattern there.

15:57.624 --> 16:01.361
Does that look like the residue
from an eyelet, actually?

16:01.394 --> 16:03.596
It looks just
the right size, uh,

16:03.630 --> 16:05.999
-for an eyelet for a shoelace.
-Yeah. Yeah, it does.

16:06.033 --> 16:07.734
-Yeah.
-You can still see the imprint.

16:07.767 --> 16:10.537
NARRATOR:
Leather? From a shoe?

16:10.570 --> 16:12.439
Could it have come from someone

16:12.472 --> 16:14.741
who was looking for treasure
on the island?

16:14.774 --> 16:18.745
Or from someone
who buried it there?

16:18.778 --> 16:21.148
-Oh, this is cool.
-Yeah.

16:21.181 --> 16:22.715
It looks like this
would then be the top,

16:22.749 --> 16:24.251
if it has lace holes.

16:24.284 --> 16:26.519
Well I think
it's a cool enough find,

16:26.553 --> 16:28.388
because it-- you know,
first of all,

16:28.421 --> 16:30.290
we weren't expecting
to find a piece of leather.

16:30.323 --> 16:32.092
-Mm-hmm.
-Maybe from a shoe.

16:32.125 --> 16:34.761
I think we need to, you know,
have this tested.

16:34.794 --> 16:38.331
Does look like it's got
some kind of history.

16:38.365 --> 16:39.766
Anyway, I'll put it in the bag.

16:39.799 --> 16:41.734
*

16:44.837 --> 16:47.040
What is this?

16:48.275 --> 16:49.376
DAN H.:
From this distance,

16:49.409 --> 16:51.044
that looks a little different

16:51.078 --> 16:52.745
from some of this stuff.

16:52.779 --> 16:54.181
It is.

16:56.516 --> 16:57.750
What do you think that is, Dan?

16:57.784 --> 16:59.586
Looks like more
plastic to me, but...

16:59.619 --> 17:02.355
No, it's not plastic,
it's almost paper-like.

17:02.389 --> 17:06.393
It doesn't resemble the piece
of parchment that we have.

17:06.426 --> 17:07.827
-Mm-hmm.
-But it kind of looks

17:07.860 --> 17:09.496
like it could be
some old parchment.

17:11.464 --> 17:14.701
NARRATOR:
In June 1897,

17:14.734 --> 17:18.138
treasure hunters William
Chappell and Frederick Blair

17:18.171 --> 17:20.240
drilled into
what they believed to be

17:20.273 --> 17:22.275
a seven-foot-tall wooden vault

17:22.309 --> 17:28.181
encased in concrete
at a depth of nearly 153 feet.

17:28.215 --> 17:32.219
When they checked their drill
bit, they were amazed to find

17:32.252 --> 17:36.756
not only traces of gold, but
also a small piece of parchment

17:36.789 --> 17:39.459
with the letters V-I
written on it.

17:39.492 --> 17:42.229
But when trying to dig a hole

17:42.262 --> 17:44.731
wide enough to retrieve
the mysterious box,

17:44.764 --> 17:48.235
the shaft flooded,
taking everything in it,

17:48.268 --> 17:50.237
including the Chappell Vault,

17:50.270 --> 17:53.340
further beneath the surface
of Oak Island.

17:53.373 --> 17:57.810
Could Jack Begley and Dan
Henskee have found evidence

17:57.844 --> 17:59.779
that the team
has finally rediscovered

17:59.812 --> 18:02.615
the so-called Chappell Vault?

18:02.649 --> 18:04.284
JACK:
All right, well,

18:04.317 --> 18:06.553
there's still a lot
to go through.

18:06.586 --> 18:08.888
Yeah, that's before
it gets dark on us.

18:08.921 --> 18:11.258
JACK:
Yes, exactly.

18:18.498 --> 18:21.668
NARRATOR: As a new day dawns
on Oak Island,

18:21.701 --> 18:25.838
Marty Lagina, Craig Tester
and Charles Barkhouse

18:25.872 --> 18:28.641
return to the Money Pit
operation,

18:28.675 --> 18:33.213
excited by the team's recent
discoveries in Borehole H-8.

18:33.246 --> 18:34.381
Where are we?

18:34.414 --> 18:36.449
So, we're on I-9.

18:36.483 --> 18:37.817
Just getting back at it
this morning,

18:37.850 --> 18:39.686
biting hard into some wood here.

18:39.719 --> 18:41.588
Bizarrest, bizarrest thing ever.

18:43.556 --> 18:45.525
MARTY: Why are we in all wood
way up there, Craig?

18:45.558 --> 18:47.694
I think it walked over here.

18:47.727 --> 18:49.629
There's a shaft right there.

18:49.662 --> 18:51.298
-We were on it right
from ten feet. -What shaft?

18:51.331 --> 18:53.533
The Hedden Shaft. 125.

18:55.768 --> 18:58.738
NARRATOR: To date, the team
from Brewster Drilling

18:58.771 --> 19:02.942
has completed 35 of 44
planned boreholes.

19:02.975 --> 19:06.313
And the Oak Island team
is more eager than ever

19:06.346 --> 19:10.250
to see what drilling the rest
of the grid might reveal.

19:11.584 --> 19:12.685
Here's Mike.

19:12.719 --> 19:14.821
-Hey, Mike.
-Hey, guys.

19:14.854 --> 19:16.823
NARRATOR: But there is also
another reason

19:16.856 --> 19:19.192
why today is so exciting.

19:19.226 --> 19:22.295
The team has scheduled
geophysicist Mike West

19:22.329 --> 19:25.632
from GEMTEC Limited
to run a dual induction device

19:25.665 --> 19:27.834
down the recently drilled
boreholes

19:27.867 --> 19:31.471
to see if he can find evidence
that a massive treasure vault

19:31.504 --> 19:32.939
could be buried
in its vicinity.

19:32.972 --> 19:34.841
TERRY: So you're gonna
help us out here today?

19:34.874 --> 19:37.844
Yeah. Yeah, actually, we got
to go through the, uh, the logs

19:37.877 --> 19:41.314
and kind of see where we want to
start, based on what you found,

19:41.348 --> 19:43.683
and, you know, probably try
to find some, some hard objects,

19:43.716 --> 19:44.751
some conductive--
something that we know,

19:44.784 --> 19:46.453
that, you know, some metal.

19:46.486 --> 19:48.721
So we want to concentrate
more on this area.

19:48.755 --> 19:52.359
You know, that F-4 would be,
would be a good one in my mind.

19:52.392 --> 19:54.594
This-- there's a debris field
we're looking for.

19:54.627 --> 19:56.329
-Yeah. -And then,
we're looking for a vault

19:56.363 --> 19:58.465
that's down around 150 feet.

19:58.498 --> 19:59.799
MARTY:
Let's rig up on that one.

19:59.832 --> 20:01.701
-Okay.
-Okay. Let's go.

20:01.734 --> 20:02.769
Let's get some results.

20:04.771 --> 20:07.607
NARRATOR: To conduct
the dual induction process,

20:07.640 --> 20:10.743
Mike will first lower
a probe down to the bottom

20:10.777 --> 20:14.581
of each of the six-inch wide
PVC-lined boreholes.

20:14.614 --> 20:17.717
As he then slowly raises it
back up to the surface,

20:17.750 --> 20:22.455
it emits an electromagnetic
field, two feet in diameter,

20:22.489 --> 20:25.525
that will scan the ground
surrounding the borehole.

20:25.558 --> 20:28.361
Taking readings
every two inches,

20:28.395 --> 20:31.498
the electromagnetic field
will register a hit

20:31.531 --> 20:33.733
whenever it comes
into contact with

20:33.766 --> 20:37.537
or senses
a nearby conductive object.

20:37.570 --> 20:41.308
MARTY: The dual induction log
is an inferential tool.

20:41.341 --> 20:43.476
It doesn't identify
gold doubloons;

20:43.510 --> 20:45.578
it identifies conductivity.

20:45.612 --> 20:47.747
But if there's a vault,

20:47.780 --> 20:49.416
and if there were metal
in pieces in there,

20:49.449 --> 20:53.052
the graph would spike outwards.

20:53.085 --> 20:54.754
Are we going to do it today?

20:54.787 --> 20:57.457
We gonna, we gonna get
out of the wood today?

20:57.490 --> 20:59.559
-That's the main thing.
-Yeah. I agree.

20:59.592 --> 21:02.495
Where's Rick at?

21:02.529 --> 21:04.897
NARRATOR: The fact that
Rick Lagina is absent

21:04.931 --> 21:08.335
from today's search efforts
is highly unusual

21:08.368 --> 21:10.069
and draws
the immediate attention

21:10.102 --> 21:11.738
of the Oak Island team.

21:11.771 --> 21:13.740
-I'm gonna go give him a call.
Okay? -Okay.

21:13.773 --> 21:15.608
NARRATOR: The dual induction
test is something

21:15.642 --> 21:17.944
he had been especially
looking forward to,

21:17.977 --> 21:20.547
and the fact that Marty
hasn't heard from him

21:20.580 --> 21:22.415
is a cause for concern.

21:24.517 --> 21:26.319
(static, inaudible dialogue)

21:26.353 --> 21:29.088
Rick?

21:29.121 --> 21:30.857
What is going on with you?

21:41.401 --> 21:42.669
Yeah?

21:55.715 --> 21:57.584
You know what, though?
I'm telling you what.

21:57.617 --> 21:59.819
That sounds like maybe you
should get... I'm serious.

21:59.852 --> 22:01.921
Maybe you should go
to the emergency room.

22:01.954 --> 22:03.656
That's enough of an emergency.

22:03.690 --> 22:05.758
You should not mess with this.

22:05.792 --> 22:07.760
Rick fights all the time about,
you know, he hardly...

22:07.794 --> 22:10.129
that guy has hardly ever been
to the doctor in his life.

22:10.162 --> 22:12.365
He's like one of those
kind of guys.

22:12.399 --> 22:15.101
Rick doesn't let much get
him down. He's pretty tough.

22:15.134 --> 22:17.036
I mean, you know,
this is serious.

22:20.640 --> 22:22.642
Yeah, but if you can't get
a doctor's appointment,

22:22.675 --> 22:25.478
I think you go off
to the hospital.

22:25.512 --> 22:28.415
I mean, this could be really
serious, you-you know, I...

22:28.448 --> 22:33.520
You still have the pounding
headache, yes?

22:33.553 --> 22:35.922
Oh, boy. All right.
I'm coming over.

22:35.955 --> 22:38.891
See you. Bye.

22:46.132 --> 22:47.534
So, how's big brother?

22:47.567 --> 22:50.403
He's sick.

22:50.437 --> 22:53.039
Um, little bit worried
about him, actually.

22:53.072 --> 22:56.976
I mean, he's usually
so indestructible, but he's...

22:57.009 --> 23:00.580
if he doesn't...
if he's not here, he's not well.

23:00.613 --> 23:02.081
Anyway, I'm gonna go see him.

23:02.114 --> 23:04.484
-Absolutely.
-All right. -Go ahead.

23:04.517 --> 23:06.486
NARRATOR: It is a tense
and suspense-filled moment

23:06.519 --> 23:08.421
on Oak Island.

23:08.455 --> 23:10.423
The news
of Rick's sudden illness

23:10.457 --> 23:13.926
has serious implications
for everyone on the team.

23:13.960 --> 23:16.095
But for Rick's younger brother,
Marty,

23:16.128 --> 23:18.931
the situation
is much more personal.

23:28.140 --> 23:29.842
MARTY:
I'm concerned.

23:29.876 --> 23:32.745
This is just
really disconcerting.

23:32.779 --> 23:35.114
The seriousness
of what Rick's suffering from

23:35.147 --> 23:38.184
was underscored, obviously,

23:38.217 --> 23:41.554
because he's not going
to stay away from Oak Island

23:41.588 --> 23:43.556
while exploration efforts
are underway.

23:43.590 --> 23:45.525
It's gonna take getting,
you know,

23:45.558 --> 23:47.660
figuratively hit by a truck
to keep him off here.

23:47.694 --> 23:49.829
-Rick.
-Hey.

23:49.862 --> 23:51.831
So, what is going on?

23:51.864 --> 23:53.232
I'm doing research
since I can't be...

23:53.265 --> 23:55.668
No, no, I'm not talking
about that-- you.

23:55.702 --> 23:56.969
I mean, I know you're sick
because you don't,

23:57.003 --> 23:58.871
you'd be on the island.

23:58.905 --> 24:00.940
-You got a rash?
-Yeah, take a look.

24:00.973 --> 24:03.142
Come on over here.
Come on over here in the light.

24:03.175 --> 24:04.944
He does not look good.

24:04.977 --> 24:06.546
You know, he just,
just his whole presence,

24:06.579 --> 24:08.214
he's got no spark,

24:08.247 --> 24:10.617
and I could tell that the pain
from his headache was,

24:10.650 --> 24:11.851
you know, almost unbearable.

24:18.057 --> 24:19.526
Right now? Even now,
pounding headache?

24:19.559 --> 24:21.694
-Yeah, right now.
-Oh, yeah.

24:21.728 --> 24:23.963
-You see it?
-Yeah.

24:23.996 --> 24:25.965
Ew. I mean, I don't know,

24:25.998 --> 24:30.570
but that looks like Lyme disease
or shingles to me.

24:30.603 --> 24:33.172
NARRATOR: Lyme disease
is a bacterial infection

24:33.205 --> 24:35.542
transmitted by the Ixodes tick,

24:35.575 --> 24:38.811
known more commonly
as a deer tick.

24:38.845 --> 24:41.514
It is often identified
by a telltale rash,

24:41.548 --> 24:43.516
resembling a bull's-eye.

24:45.652 --> 24:47.754
All right, got it.

24:47.787 --> 24:49.889
NARRATOR: Although not
usually life-threatening,

24:49.922 --> 24:53.960
if not detected early,
it can result in severe damage

24:53.993 --> 24:57.997
to the brain, muscles,
heart and nervous system.

24:58.030 --> 24:59.899
I know, I know
this is serious, Rick,

24:59.932 --> 25:01.701
because there's no way
you weren't on Oak Island.

25:01.734 --> 25:03.302
I mean, let's get you
to a doctor.

25:03.335 --> 25:05.204
Let's go. Come on.

25:05.237 --> 25:08.708
It's difficult for me to see
Rick clearly very, very ill.

25:08.741 --> 25:11.778
He's been his whole life,
more or less, indestructible.

25:11.811 --> 25:15.648
Come on, let's go. Let's go.

25:15.682 --> 25:17.550
You know I have an aversion
with doctors, right?

25:17.584 --> 25:19.986
Yeah, I know, well,
y-y-you're about to be...

25:20.019 --> 25:22.088
RICK: I haven't been to a doctor
in 50 years.

25:22.121 --> 25:23.690
MARTY:
It doesn't matter.

25:23.723 --> 25:25.157
We're going to a doctor.
Let's go.

25:25.191 --> 25:27.126
He has a very high tolerance
for pain.

25:27.159 --> 25:29.696
I can tell you that for sure.

25:29.729 --> 25:33.065
And he will motor through,
carry on,

25:33.099 --> 25:35.935
finish the job in virtually
any circumstances,

25:35.968 --> 25:37.670
so I know this is serious.

25:37.704 --> 25:39.138
So, it, you know,
I mean, you know,

25:39.171 --> 25:40.807
he's my brother, I love him.

25:40.840 --> 25:43.075
I-I hate to see him
sick like that.

25:43.109 --> 25:45.845
Let's go.

25:50.817 --> 25:54.186
NARRATOR: One hour after being
taken by his brother Marty

25:54.220 --> 25:58.190
to a local doctor, Rick Lagina
has just been diagnosed

25:58.224 --> 26:02.061
with a debilitating condition
called Lyme disease.

26:02.094 --> 26:04.196
Tell you what, though,
I-I really, I would've not...

26:04.230 --> 26:06.699
had it not been for the rash...

26:06.733 --> 26:08.835
No, you wouldn't think. You'd
think you just got something,

26:08.868 --> 26:10.069
-you know, a bug.
-Yep.

26:10.102 --> 26:12.204
I know, it's-it's scary.

26:12.238 --> 26:14.373
-Scary considering what it can
turn into. -But I'm glad you,

26:14.406 --> 26:16.242
I'm glad you, I'm glad you
brought awareness, though,

26:16.275 --> 26:18.778
because now I'm going
to be paranoid.

26:18.811 --> 26:21.848
I was completely unaware that
I had gotten Lyme disease.

26:21.881 --> 26:23.950
Had it not been
for the bull's-eye,

26:23.983 --> 26:26.085
I would've paid no attention.

26:26.118 --> 26:29.989
And there's a lot of serious
complications that arise

26:30.022 --> 26:32.792
if you don't catch it early.

26:32.825 --> 26:34.861
NARRATOR: Luckily,
Rick's case of Lyme disease

26:34.894 --> 26:36.829
was caught early.

26:36.863 --> 26:39.231
He will only require
a regimen of antibiotics

26:39.265 --> 26:41.734
for the next 30 days.

26:41.768 --> 26:44.937
But he will also have to submit
to his doctor's orders,

26:44.971 --> 26:47.674
something the fiercely healthy
treasure hunter

26:47.707 --> 26:49.809
will have difficulty
getting used to.

26:52.011 --> 26:54.313
The worst thing for me
is now-- is, you know,

26:54.346 --> 26:56.749
because of the side effects
of the pills,

26:56.783 --> 26:59.952
I have to stay out of the sun,
and you know me, I hate that.

26:59.986 --> 27:03.055
Oh, yeah, Rick, but come on.
(laughs)

27:03.089 --> 27:05.091
Oh, look, you have to do what
you have to do. I get that.

27:05.124 --> 27:06.358
But you're just lucky you got me

27:06.392 --> 27:07.760
to come out here
and take care of you.

27:07.794 --> 27:08.928
That's all I can say.

27:08.961 --> 27:10.329
Go home. Go home and lay down.

27:10.362 --> 27:13.065
You know, give it a day,
at least.

27:13.099 --> 27:15.034
Yes.

27:24.376 --> 27:26.112
All right, big brother,
go lay down.

27:26.145 --> 27:30.182
I am. My head's pulling apart
as we speak.

27:30.216 --> 27:31.751
-See you, Rick.
-All right, see you, thanks.

27:31.784 --> 27:33.720
Yeah.

27:39.291 --> 27:42.795
That slowed him down.

27:42.829 --> 27:45.264
Rick is the spiritual leader
of this group.

27:45.297 --> 27:47.199
While he's gone,

27:47.233 --> 27:51.871
you know, things don't quite
have the same intensity

27:51.904 --> 27:55.107
or, you know, uh, spirit.

27:55.141 --> 27:57.109
Uh, we need him here.

28:00.880 --> 28:04.150
NARRATOR: While Rick Lagina
gets some much needed rest,

28:04.183 --> 28:06.753
Craig Tester and Jack Begley,

28:06.786 --> 28:09.488
along with geophysicist,
Mike West,

28:09.521 --> 28:11.290
are back at the Money Pit.

28:11.323 --> 28:12.925
-MIKE: Am I good?
-CRAIG: Yeah.

28:12.959 --> 28:14.326
NARRATOR:
They are continuing to scan

28:14.360 --> 28:16.495
the previously drilled
Geotech holes

28:16.528 --> 28:20.867
for traces of metal
and possible treasure.

28:20.900 --> 28:24.270
So far, they have searched
a total of eight boreholes

28:24.303 --> 28:28.107
but have yet to register
any significant results.

28:28.140 --> 28:30.442
Okay, H-8, this is
the important one.

28:30.476 --> 28:31.744
Okay, just run her down.

28:31.778 --> 28:33.312
NARRATOR:
But now,

28:33.345 --> 28:36.482
the team is about to scan
Borehole H-8,

28:36.515 --> 28:39.752
where they have not only found
two fragments of bone

28:39.786 --> 28:41.754
but also bits of paper--

28:41.788 --> 28:44.957
similar to the one found
in the so-called Chappell Vault

28:44.991 --> 28:47.426
more than a century ago.

28:47.459 --> 28:49.461
Is this your favorite so far
of the drilled holes?

28:49.495 --> 28:52.331
It probably is, with the china
being as deep as it was

28:52.364 --> 28:54.366
and below the clay.

28:54.400 --> 28:57.203
That's proof that it's part
of the old Money Pit,

28:57.236 --> 28:59.471
-and then it collapsed down,
or...? -It could be.

28:59.505 --> 29:01.974
That's my thinking. So...

29:02.008 --> 29:03.442
CRAIG:
Marty.

29:03.475 --> 29:04.443
(chuckles)

29:04.476 --> 29:06.145
MARTY:
Hi, guys.

29:06.178 --> 29:07.313
-Hey.
-Hi, Marty.

29:07.346 --> 29:11.083
-We got-- just got down
to the bottom of H-8. -Oh, good.

29:11.117 --> 29:14.153
-This is depth here?
-In meters.

29:14.186 --> 29:15.254
-MARTY: This hole is deep.
-MIKE: To the bottom of the...

29:15.287 --> 29:16.455
Oh, yeah, of course.

29:16.488 --> 29:18.290
'Cause this is 200
and some odd feet, right?

29:18.324 --> 29:19.892
-Yup.
-MIKE: Get started?

29:19.926 --> 29:21.828
NARRATOR:
As the dual induction probe

29:21.861 --> 29:24.563
is raised from the bottom
of Borehole H-8,

29:24.596 --> 29:27.333
it will emit
an electromagnetic field

29:27.366 --> 29:29.401
through the surrounding earth.

29:29.435 --> 29:31.904
The team is hoping
for significant readings

29:31.938 --> 29:34.106
in two areas of interest.

29:34.140 --> 29:36.042
Okay, that's
kind of interesting.

29:36.075 --> 29:39.912
One at 192 feet,
where they recovered bits

29:39.946 --> 29:41.547
of 18th century pottery...

29:41.580 --> 29:45.017
Wow.

29:45.051 --> 29:49.021
Ivan said he's in some sort
of void, but he hit something.

29:49.055 --> 29:52.591
...and another
at a depth of 145 feet,

29:52.624 --> 29:56.295
where the drill encountered
a mysterious object.

29:56.328 --> 29:59.832
The stand-out well
in our Geotech grid is H-8.

29:59.866 --> 30:01.367
I'm really intrigued by it.

30:01.400 --> 30:04.003
We have pottery way too deep

30:04.036 --> 30:06.438
for any searchers
to have placed it there.

30:06.472 --> 30:09.441
We have odd bones
that came out of that hole.

30:09.475 --> 30:11.844
And now we need
to see what's there.

30:13.445 --> 30:15.447
-You getting readings?
-Yeah.

30:15.481 --> 30:18.184
(beeping)

30:18.217 --> 30:19.986
CRAIG: Picking
something else up right here.

30:22.088 --> 30:23.155
MARTY:
What do you make of that?

30:33.399 --> 30:34.967
NARRATOR: While running
a metal detection device

30:35.001 --> 30:36.969
down Borehole H-8,

30:37.003 --> 30:40.873
Marty Lagina-- along with
Craig Tester, Jack Begley

30:40.907 --> 30:43.109
and geophysicist Mike West--

30:43.142 --> 30:44.643
have just received

30:44.676 --> 30:47.113
some potentially exciting
information.

30:47.146 --> 30:49.648
Let's see where it finishes.

30:49.681 --> 30:52.184
There's a pretty good upswing
there, pretty quick.

30:52.218 --> 30:56.188
That's at 160 feet, where it
first even started picking up.

30:56.222 --> 30:57.589
-Yeah.
-The actual anomaly is probably

30:57.623 --> 30:59.558
-a little higher.
-Kicks out, yeah.

30:59.591 --> 31:02.128
NARRATOR:
The spike on the graph

31:02.161 --> 31:05.031
registering above
the 160-foot mark

31:05.064 --> 31:07.199
indicates the likelihood

31:07.233 --> 31:10.903
of a large metal anomaly
near Borehole H-8.

31:10.937 --> 31:15.207
But now a bigger question
remains: what does it mean?

31:15.241 --> 31:17.443
Could it be
that the team has located

31:17.476 --> 31:19.178
the fabled Chappell Vault?

31:19.211 --> 31:21.513
Or might it be evidence
of something

31:21.547 --> 31:23.582
even more significant?

31:23.615 --> 31:26.118
Which would put it
very near the vault.

31:26.152 --> 31:28.587
You mean that-that this hit

31:28.620 --> 31:31.490
corresponds with where
the vault's supposed to be at?

31:31.523 --> 31:34.160
Very close, yeah, and in,
you know, historically

31:34.193 --> 31:35.661
how accurate is everything,
so...

31:35.694 --> 31:37.964
Yeah, it kind of went off scale

31:37.997 --> 31:39.498
and now it's,
now it's coming back down to...

31:39.531 --> 31:42.101
to kind of what
you typically see.

31:42.134 --> 31:43.569
-That's a little odd.
-And that's, yeah,

31:43.602 --> 31:46.505
a little discreet
little blip there, as well.

31:46.538 --> 31:48.240
I understand
what this thing's reading,

31:48.274 --> 31:50.609
but that looked pretty
significant to me. Is it to you?

31:50.642 --> 31:52.378
It matters whether it is to you.

31:52.411 --> 31:54.213
Yeah, you know, most of
the changes we were seeing

31:54.246 --> 31:55.614
were, uh,
much more subtle than that.

31:55.647 --> 31:58.250
The response was fairly rapid

31:58.284 --> 32:00.252
and then it decayed off,
and if that's...

32:00.286 --> 32:02.288
At about 155 feet,
as I understand it.

32:02.321 --> 32:04.123
-Yeah, yup.
-Yep.

32:04.156 --> 32:06.025
MARTY: Well, it is
the Chappell Vault, isn't it?

32:06.058 --> 32:07.059
I mean, I don't know that
that's the Chappell Vault,

32:07.093 --> 32:08.360
but that's where it should be.

32:08.394 --> 32:09.595
That's the depth range
it should be in,

32:09.628 --> 32:10.729
-sure is.
-Well, heigh-ho!

32:10.762 --> 32:13.599
So in one hole we got evidence

32:13.632 --> 32:15.501
of something at
the Chappell Vault level,

32:15.534 --> 32:18.604
we got pottery
where it can't be...

32:18.637 --> 32:20.339
Too-- way too deep, yeah.

32:20.372 --> 32:21.673
And we got oddball stuff.

32:21.707 --> 32:23.442
Odd wood.

32:23.475 --> 32:24.743
It's the Money Pit.

32:24.776 --> 32:26.378
NARRATOR:
The Money Pit?

32:26.412 --> 32:29.048
The original treasure shaft,

32:29.081 --> 32:32.084
first discovered in 1795

32:32.118 --> 32:36.355
and then lost after a cave-in
more than 100 years ago?

32:36.388 --> 32:38.524
What I'm trying to say is this
just went to target number one,

32:38.557 --> 32:40.026
if we dig a big hole, I think.

32:40.059 --> 32:41.593
-Yeah, in my eyes.
-MARTY: Yeah.

32:41.627 --> 32:44.263
Are you sure enough for me
to say this is for real?

32:44.296 --> 32:45.531
Oh, it's a for real target
right there.

32:45.564 --> 32:47.433
Yeah, that's what I mean,

32:47.466 --> 32:49.301
it's not a glitch in
the machinery or something?

32:49.335 --> 32:51.203
No, no, there's...
it's, there's definitely a,

32:51.237 --> 32:53.772
a drastic difference there
from-from the surroundings.

32:53.805 --> 32:55.707
It went off the chart.

32:55.741 --> 32:58.110
MARTY: There's some big
chunk of metal there.

32:58.144 --> 33:00.746
There's... there's definitely
something out of the ordinary.

33:03.115 --> 33:06.018
I have liked H-8
as our target well anyway,

33:06.052 --> 33:09.721
because of that pottery found
at 200 feet and the bone.

33:09.755 --> 33:11.290
There's just no way
to explain that

33:11.323 --> 33:13.292
other than that is
the Money Pit,

33:13.325 --> 33:16.362
and having a chance
at piercing the vault, too,

33:16.395 --> 33:21.467
at 155 as we go on down
is doubly exciting.

33:21.500 --> 33:23.702
NARRATOR:
Can the Chappell Vault

33:23.735 --> 33:27.339
and the Oak Island treasure
be one and the same?

33:27.373 --> 33:29.641
And have the Laginas
and their partners

33:29.675 --> 33:32.511
finally found it at last?

33:32.544 --> 33:34.380
Well, I'm gonna go tell Rick.

33:34.413 --> 33:36.548
-Okay, sounds good. -Yep.
-I'll see how he is, too.

33:36.582 --> 33:37.783
-All right, thanks a lot, guys,
that's great. -Okay. -Yeah.

33:40.786 --> 33:44.290
NARRATOR: Although Rick Lagina
is still recovering

33:44.323 --> 33:47.226
from the debilitating symptoms
of Lyme disease,

33:47.259 --> 33:48.827
the news he is about to hear

33:48.860 --> 33:50.529
from his younger brother Marty

33:50.562 --> 33:53.465
may very well provide
the perfect cure.

33:53.499 --> 33:56.168
Well, what's going on?

33:56.202 --> 33:58.537
-How you feeling?
-I feel better.

33:58.570 --> 34:00.139
Rick, I know you don't.
You know why?

34:00.172 --> 34:01.773
Because you weren't
on the island.

34:01.807 --> 34:04.143
You know, everybody's, you know,
missing your presence

34:04.176 --> 34:06.078
and everybody said
they-they miss you.

34:06.112 --> 34:07.379
Well, I was gonna,
I wanted to be there

34:07.413 --> 34:09.515
-because you guys ran H-8 today,
right? -I know.

34:09.548 --> 34:10.816
-Yes.
-And...?

34:15.554 --> 34:18.424
In, um, H-8,

34:18.457 --> 34:21.560
there is definitely an anomaly

34:21.593 --> 34:24.830
at about 44 meters.

34:24.863 --> 34:27.833
Right where Ivan said he thought
he was going past something,

34:27.866 --> 34:29.601
right where
the chamber should be,

34:29.635 --> 34:31.470
right where Chappell
would have drilled it.

34:31.503 --> 34:33.805
So, that's pretty exciting
because a lot of the other wells

34:33.839 --> 34:35.507
aren't showing
anything like that.

34:35.541 --> 34:37.609
If we had to sink
a large caisson right now,

34:37.643 --> 34:39.678
you'd, you'd pick H-8.

34:39.711 --> 34:42.214
That's where I would dig
for this year.

34:42.248 --> 34:44.750
Yeah, to me, Rick...

34:44.783 --> 34:47.319
I think we found the Money Pit.

34:48.887 --> 34:50.789
That's where it is.

34:50.822 --> 34:53.125
Coming from you,
that's a pretty...

34:53.159 --> 34:55.127
Well,
there was a Money Pit, Rick.

34:55.161 --> 34:57.163
I never doubted
there was a Money Pit.

34:57.196 --> 34:59.398
RICK:
When I hear

34:59.431 --> 35:02.201
from my brother saying,
"We found the Money Pit..."

35:02.234 --> 35:04.903
I mean, he describes himself
as the skeptic-in-chief,

35:04.936 --> 35:08.240
and the skeptic-in-chief
has just pronounced

35:08.274 --> 35:10.609
that we found the Money Pit.

35:10.642 --> 35:13.279
Look, I'm not going
to come this far and quit.

35:13.312 --> 35:16.315
"They found the Money Pit
for sure and then they quit."

35:16.348 --> 35:19.485
(both laughing)

35:19.518 --> 35:21.387
You know, we've spent years
together doing this,

35:21.420 --> 35:25.191
and, you know, our families
are involved, our nephews,

35:25.224 --> 35:29.295
uh, you know,
his son, Craig's sons.

35:29.328 --> 35:32.631
In that moment, my thoughts go

35:32.664 --> 35:35.801
to all the people
that have come before us.

35:35.834 --> 35:38.237
-(laughs) Yes!
-All right.

35:38.270 --> 35:39.805
All right. So that's it.
That's your report.

35:39.838 --> 35:41.340
-Okay.
-So get well.

35:41.373 --> 35:42.441
-Yeah, thanks.
-We'll see you.

35:42.474 --> 35:44.943
See you in the morning. H-8.

35:44.976 --> 35:45.844
-H-8 it is.
-Let's do it.

35:45.877 --> 35:47.579
We found the Money Pit.

35:47.613 --> 35:49.548
*

35:54.486 --> 35:57.289
NARRATOR: Three days
after a metal detection device

35:57.323 --> 35:59.758
confirmed the presence
of a large metallic anomaly

35:59.791 --> 36:01.527
near Borehole H-8,

36:01.560 --> 36:04.396
Rick Lagina has
sufficiently recovered

36:04.430 --> 36:06.365
from his battle
with Lyme disease

36:06.398 --> 36:08.767
to return to
the Oak Island war room

36:08.800 --> 36:11.370
with some exciting information
he has just received

36:11.403 --> 36:13.505
from St. Mary's University

36:13.539 --> 36:15.307
concerning the bone fragments

36:15.341 --> 36:17.776
found at the Money Pit
drill site.

36:17.809 --> 36:20.246
RICK: Well, guys, I've got
some really...

36:20.279 --> 36:21.913
I think you're going to find

36:21.947 --> 36:24.883
almost to the point of being
incredible information here.

36:24.916 --> 36:26.485
We need to get Marty
on the line.

36:26.518 --> 36:28.387
I think we all
need to hear this.

36:28.420 --> 36:30.389
-Very interesting.
-CHARLES: Sounds serious.

36:30.422 --> 36:31.690
Well, it's important,

36:31.723 --> 36:32.958
-it's very important.
-Okay.

36:32.991 --> 36:34.860
So, let's get my brother
on the line.

36:34.893 --> 36:36.762
NARRATOR:
Although he had to fly home

36:36.795 --> 36:38.997
to Michigan
on important business,

36:39.030 --> 36:41.300
Marty Lagina is able
to join the meeting

36:41.333 --> 36:42.434
via video conference.

36:42.468 --> 36:44.536
MARTY:
Hey, guys, I'm on.

36:44.570 --> 36:46.305
What do you got?

36:46.338 --> 36:51.443
Okay, I have here in my hand
some very...

36:51.477 --> 36:52.878
I hate the word "interesting,"

36:52.911 --> 36:54.646
but some very interesting
results.

36:57.516 --> 36:59.685
Uh, you know, we sent the bones
off to be tested.

36:59.718 --> 37:01.553
Yeah.

37:01.587 --> 37:03.655
And I'm going to read
this verbatim, okay?

37:03.689 --> 37:05.424
MARTY:
Okay. Yes?

37:05.457 --> 37:08.427
It says, "We now have results
from the two bones.

37:08.460 --> 37:11.697
"Both sequenced successfully,

37:11.730 --> 37:14.900
and both came back as human."

37:17.536 --> 37:18.870
-Wow.
-RICK: Just a second.

37:18.904 --> 37:20.739
Just one minute.

37:20.772 --> 37:23.309
"They appear to be different."

37:25.744 --> 37:27.746
Okay.

37:27.779 --> 37:29.848
I'm just reading it verbatim.

37:29.881 --> 37:33.585
"I will do some more work
trying to see what we can learn

37:33.619 --> 37:36.888
"about these sequences,
i.e. if it is possible to infer

37:36.922 --> 37:38.590
something about
region of origin."

37:38.624 --> 37:40.326
What?

37:40.359 --> 37:42.027
"It should just take
a few days for that."

37:42.060 --> 37:43.429
MARTY:
Wow.

37:43.462 --> 37:45.531
I didn't even think to ask that.

37:45.564 --> 37:48.300
-Yep. I know.
-(laughs)

37:48.334 --> 37:49.067
Fantastic.

37:49.100 --> 37:50.969
Quite remarkable.

37:51.002 --> 37:53.639
NARRATOR:
Human bones?

37:53.672 --> 37:55.574
From two different sources?

37:57.976 --> 38:00.912
Could they be the bones
of past treasure hunters?

38:00.946 --> 38:04.416
Or could they be those of the
men who buried treasure there,

38:04.450 --> 38:06.885
more than two centuries ago?

38:06.918 --> 38:09.755
Perhaps further testing
will reveal at last

38:09.788 --> 38:13.525
the origins--
and possibly the identities--

38:13.559 --> 38:17.529
of the perpetrators of one of
the world's greatest mysteries.

38:17.563 --> 38:23.335
So, that's two different human
bones in the Money Pit?

38:25.136 --> 38:26.938
You know, Rick,

38:26.972 --> 38:28.740
when you were talking about
finding the one thing,

38:28.774 --> 38:30.776
could it have been something
different than this, please?

38:30.809 --> 38:32.644
(laughter)

38:32.678 --> 38:34.946
-Yeah.
-DAVE: What's going to happen

38:34.980 --> 38:37.516
when we notify
the government a this?

38:37.549 --> 38:40.419
Well, I think... I think
our next step is carbon dating.

38:40.452 --> 38:43.422
We have a window of time
to notify the authorities.

38:43.455 --> 38:46.392
If they carbon-date
long, long ago--

38:46.425 --> 38:49.561
I think, Charles, the rules
are 50 years or something?

38:49.595 --> 38:51.897
Something like that.
I'm not sure, but there is a...

38:51.930 --> 38:53.999
So, if there is... much, much
older, hundreds of years,

38:54.032 --> 38:56.402
we-we... there's no
notification processes

38:56.435 --> 38:59.104
that we have to follow.

38:59.137 --> 39:01.407
So we're going
to immediately start down

39:01.440 --> 39:02.974
that road of carbon dating.

39:03.008 --> 39:04.876
I think we should send it off

39:04.910 --> 39:07.846
to have another entity
look into it.

39:07.879 --> 39:10.516
Well, this is serious
and significant,

39:10.549 --> 39:13.585
so, yeah, I agree, let's look
at it from every which way,

39:13.619 --> 39:14.686
but wow!

39:14.720 --> 39:16.455
-RICK: Yep.
-Wow!

39:16.488 --> 39:17.789
Human bones in the Money Pit.

39:17.823 --> 39:20.659
Unaccounted for.

39:20.692 --> 39:23.962
I told you H-8 is the place
to dig, I told you.

39:23.995 --> 39:25.597
-Well done.
-(Dave chuckles)

39:25.631 --> 39:27.699
-Well done.
-Yes, thank you. Thank you.

39:27.733 --> 39:32.070
My hope is that they can infer
something about origin.

39:32.103 --> 39:33.939
Ethnicity, if you will.

39:33.972 --> 39:36.708
That would be spectacular.

39:36.742 --> 39:38.544
MARTY: I tell you
what's going to be interesting

39:38.577 --> 39:41.146
when we dig that big hole
right at that depth, oh, boy!

39:41.179 --> 39:43.014
(laughs)

39:43.048 --> 39:44.850
Okay, Rick, that's great.

39:44.883 --> 39:46.051
Fantastic news.

39:46.084 --> 39:47.686
Really, really interesting.

39:47.719 --> 39:49.421
Yup, it is.
No question about it.

39:49.455 --> 39:50.989
MARTY:
All right.

39:51.022 --> 39:52.991
Let us know as soon
as you find out more.

39:53.024 --> 39:54.826
Well, you know that's the case.

39:54.860 --> 39:56.462
I just want to get
down there now.

39:56.495 --> 39:57.896
Let's get down there.

39:57.929 --> 39:59.965
-Okay, we're off.
-All right.

39:59.998 --> 40:01.533
You know,
you couldn't have guessed it

40:01.567 --> 40:03.101
or you couldn't
have predicted it,

40:03.134 --> 40:04.703
but it...
I guess it's Rick's one thing.

40:04.736 --> 40:06.104
He wanted to find one thing

40:06.137 --> 40:09.174
out of those 44 holes,
and up pops this.

40:09.207 --> 40:11.042
We couldn't have predicted it.

40:11.076 --> 40:13.779
It's not the one thing
that I had hoped for, but...

40:13.812 --> 40:15.647
but it's... it's certainly...

40:15.681 --> 40:19.618
it's certainly close,
if not... if not it.

40:19.651 --> 40:22.020
Well, look, it's high time
we have a breakthrough

40:22.053 --> 40:23.955
-and maybe this is
a breakthrough. -Yeah.

40:23.989 --> 40:26.057
So, let's get it done.

40:26.091 --> 40:28.627
NARRATOR: For brothers
Rick and Marty Lagina,

40:28.660 --> 40:32.197
their decades-long quest
to solve the Oak Island mystery

40:32.230 --> 40:35.667
has just achieved
an important breakthrough.

40:35.701 --> 40:39.070
But once they begin
a further exploration

40:39.104 --> 40:43.975
of the area around Borehole
H-8, what will they find?

40:44.009 --> 40:48.246
A treasure vault filled with
gold and priceless artifacts?

40:48.279 --> 40:52.050
Precious manuscripts
written on parchment?

40:52.083 --> 40:56.922
Or a tomb containing
ancient human remains?

40:56.955 --> 41:00.559
Perhaps the answers lie
in two pieces of bone

41:00.592 --> 41:03.261
and in man-made objects

41:03.294 --> 41:06.632
found some 190 feet below
the island's surface--

41:06.665 --> 41:08.934
more than 50 feet deeper

41:08.967 --> 41:12.604
than anyone has ever been known
to go before.

41:15.941 --> 41:19.010
Next time on
The Curse of Oak Island...

41:19.044 --> 41:21.046
MAN: If somebody was
actually going to build

41:21.079 --> 41:23.549
this engineering marvel,

41:23.582 --> 41:25.851
it would be Sir Francis Drake.

41:25.884 --> 41:27.586
It's definitely not natural.

41:27.619 --> 41:29.788
And it's perfectly square.
