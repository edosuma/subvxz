WEBVTT

00:06.203 --> 00:08.163
When you told Paige
you'd rather be friends

00:08.164 --> 00:09.914
I didn't believe a word of it.

00:09.915 --> 00:11.249
I didn't see that guy coming.

00:11.250 --> 00:13.343
Every time they put up new sets

00:13.344 --> 00:14.678
it never gets old.

00:14.679 --> 00:18.282
- Let's go to Vegas.
- We can't go to Vegas with you.

00:20.491 --> 00:21.851
'Cassie is a topless maid.'

00:21.852 --> 00:24.688
I just found out that I get
an assistant on the movie

00:24.689 --> 00:26.523
and I don't even really need one

00:26.524 --> 00:28.817
so you could just do
it in between classes.

00:28.818 --> 00:30.628
I'd be your assistant?

00:31.904 --> 00:34.406
Xu Yifei is perfect for the part.

00:34.407 --> 00:36.032
Tangey is already playing that role.

00:36.033 --> 00:37.993
You're fired.

00:37.994 --> 00:40.996
She's in jail. She's my mom.
What am I supposed to do?

00:40.997 --> 00:42.497
Look at it this way.

00:42.498 --> 00:45.208
Now, no one will know that
your parents aren't really dead.

00:45.209 --> 00:46.894
You can stay here till he gets back.

00:49.046 --> 00:50.856
We've been robbed.

01:07.773 --> 01:09.524
Multi-tasking, huh?

01:09.525 --> 01:13.945
Uh-huh, I have, uh,
an Econ midterm exam.

01:13.946 --> 01:16.715
- And I'm failing the class.
- Come here. Bring it in.

01:18.492 --> 01:20.744
Oh, Paige, you're a superstar.

01:20.745 --> 01:22.248
You're gonna knock that out just like

01:22.249 --> 01:23.979
we're gonna knock this
dance rehearsal out.

01:23.980 --> 01:26.166
- Is Rainer coming?
- He's still not feeling well.

01:26.167 --> 01:27.709
Haven't rehearsed all week.

01:27.710 --> 01:30.253
Rainer is a solid dancer.
He'll catch up in no time.

01:30.254 --> 01:33.089
It's not him I'm worried about.

01:33.090 --> 01:36.092
I just really wanna get this right.

01:36.093 --> 01:37.613
- You're comin' along.
- You know what?

01:37.614 --> 01:39.532
I think I'm gonna give
Rainer one last call.

01:39.533 --> 01:42.116
Just to see if he's feelin' any better.

01:55.696 --> 01:56.881
Hey.

02:02.036 --> 02:03.787
- Yo.
- Ah!

02:03.788 --> 02:07.207
I used to think these lounge
chairs were so comfortable.

02:07.208 --> 02:09.268
Not after sleepin' on
them for two nights.

02:10.752 --> 02:12.938
- Who keeps calling you?
- Paige.

02:14.131 --> 02:17.217
We have a dance rehearsal. Right now.

02:17.218 --> 02:19.094
- You headed out?
- Going on a run.

02:19.095 --> 02:21.012
Wait, so you're just
gonna ice Paige out?

02:21.013 --> 02:23.848
No. I'm finally listening.

02:23.849 --> 02:25.642
'She has been pushin'
me away for weeks.'

02:25.643 --> 02:27.060
Message received.

02:27.061 --> 02:29.062
Every time I-I think of making headway

02:29.063 --> 02:32.065
I realize I'm that much further away.

02:32.066 --> 02:33.858
It's like a riptide.

02:33.859 --> 02:35.693
'She didn't even try
to meet me in Vegas.'

02:35.694 --> 02:38.613
- So I'm done tryin' so hard.
- You still gotta work together.

02:38.614 --> 02:41.175
Of course. I'll show up.

02:42.284 --> 02:43.993
'Hey, man.'

02:43.994 --> 02:47.872
I checked a few places where
my mom and I used to pawn stuff.

02:47.873 --> 02:49.958
So far no luck. I'm sorry, man.

02:49.959 --> 02:51.209
Don't sweat it.

02:51.210 --> 02:53.586
My designer ordered new furniture.

02:53.587 --> 02:55.422
Well, the same stuff I had.

02:55.423 --> 02:58.091
So, everything will just go back to

02:58.092 --> 03:00.194
exactly the way it was before.

03:18.237 --> 03:20.196
Was that a smile?

03:20.197 --> 03:21.300
You like that line I added?

03:21.301 --> 03:23.570
I'm getting performance anxiety.

03:25.703 --> 03:27.120
How am I suppose to read with those

03:27.121 --> 03:29.080
big brown eyes tracking my every word?

03:29.081 --> 03:31.141
I just want to know if
you like the rewrite.

03:31.667 --> 03:33.060
Better?

03:34.128 --> 03:35.354
Worse?

03:36.297 --> 03:38.882
It's great. I love it.

03:38.883 --> 03:40.967
Hey, you helped make it better.

03:40.968 --> 03:42.719
You're a great producer.

03:42.720 --> 03:45.221
Yeah, well, it doesn't
matter what I think.

03:45.222 --> 03:46.723
It's what Newcastle thinks.

03:46.724 --> 03:49.243
And we'll find out today
when we get their notes.

03:50.144 --> 03:52.687
You know, I'm glad I did the rewrite.

03:52.688 --> 03:54.581
It's finally in the
shape I want it to be.

04:05.659 --> 04:07.970
That's not the only
thing that's in shape.

04:11.332 --> 04:17.266
Subtitle sync and corrections by
<font color="#33FF00"><b>awaqeded</b></font> for <font color="#33FF00"><b>www.addic7ed.com.</b></font>

04:19.964 --> 04:21.673
- 'You gotta be kidding me.'
- 'Tangey.'

04:21.675 --> 04:23.301
'The reason you're being replaced'

04:23.302 --> 04:25.720
has nothing to do with your performance.

04:25.721 --> 04:28.097
Replaced? Like fired?

04:28.098 --> 04:29.849
No, there are some issues

04:29.850 --> 04:31.434
with foreign distribution and grosses.

04:31.435 --> 04:33.394
Because of these external considerations

04:33.395 --> 04:36.272
you're being replaced by an
actor who offers something

04:36.273 --> 04:39.192
additional to those markets.

04:39.193 --> 04:43.029
Well, I mean, what don't I offer?

04:43.030 --> 04:44.923
You're just, you're not Chinese.

04:46.200 --> 04:49.702
Okay, look, Tangey, you
have a stellar future.

04:49.703 --> 04:51.329
We're already lookin' into projects

04:51.330 --> 04:52.580
at Gold Brothers for you.

04:52.581 --> 04:54.764
And we cannot wait to work
with you and your soundtrack

04:54.765 --> 04:56.292
for "Locked." Boom!

04:56.293 --> 04:57.919
I signed a contract.

04:57.920 --> 05:01.965
And we're paying that
contract out. In full.

05:01.966 --> 05:05.051
So you're absolutely not fired.

05:05.052 --> 05:07.428
But as of today, you're
no longer legally obligated

05:07.429 --> 05:10.240
to render acting services for "Locked."

05:11.767 --> 05:14.203
It sure sounds like I'm fired.

05:14.853 --> 05:16.437
And we're rolling.

05:16.438 --> 05:18.273
Today, it's been confirmed that Xu Yifei

05:18.274 --> 05:20.191
China's highest ranking box office star

05:20.192 --> 05:22.110
'is replacing Tangey Turner.'

05:22.111 --> 05:24.195
'Fei's actually the
third actress to take on'

05:24.196 --> 05:26.406
'the pivotal role of
"Locked's" Time Sorceress.'

05:26.407 --> 05:29.385
'But will the revolving door
of actresses stop with her?'

05:31.120 --> 05:32.888
She just walked through the shot.

05:40.129 --> 05:41.629
- Nice.
- Oh!

05:41.630 --> 05:44.340
Oh, wow, Cassie, please
stop, you're too kind.

05:44.341 --> 05:47.719
- Yes, please stop. Too kind.
- Cassie, this is..

05:47.720 --> 05:50.013
Stephen Twitch Boss from
"So You Think You Can Dance."

05:50.014 --> 05:52.765
You do not wanna know how
many times I have YouTubed

05:52.766 --> 05:54.225
"Dreaming With A Broken Heart."

05:54.226 --> 05:56.894
Twitch and Quarantine are my OTP.

05:56.895 --> 05:58.521
You're routines are the stuff of legend.

05:58.522 --> 05:59.731
Thank you, alright.

05:59.732 --> 06:01.482
It's, uh, very nice to meet you, Cassie.

06:01.483 --> 06:03.359
Um, you can just call me Twitch.

06:03.360 --> 06:05.778
Apparently the, uh,
other half of your OTP

06:05.779 --> 06:07.299
and let's a take a five, I'm gonna see

06:07.300 --> 06:08.683
if Rainer actually ever showed up.

06:08.684 --> 06:09.991
- Okay.
- Cool. Nice to meet you.

06:09.992 --> 06:11.159
Not a bad morning.

06:11.160 --> 06:13.703
Twitch and a Barret Hopper sighting.

06:13.704 --> 06:15.607
Hey, what's up with all
the news trucks outside?

06:15.608 --> 06:18.875
They hired some mega
movie star from China. So..

06:18.876 --> 06:20.585
But all the roles are already cast.

06:20.586 --> 06:22.420
I'm just, just tellin' you what I heard.

06:22.421 --> 06:24.255
Look, I'll be back.

06:24.256 --> 06:27.383
Hey, Cas, did you fill
out your paperwork?

06:27.384 --> 06:29.427
Uh, no. I just got here.

06:29.428 --> 06:33.640
But I was thinking I should've
told you this morning that I..

06:33.641 --> 06:35.683
Is everything okay?

06:35.684 --> 06:38.311
I'm not really sure if
I'm gonna have the time

06:38.312 --> 06:40.313
to be your assistant full
time and go to school.

06:40.314 --> 06:43.024
That's kind of why the
other job worked out so well.

06:43.025 --> 06:45.193
No, no, no. It's not full time.

06:45.194 --> 06:47.737
That's the thing. You can
do whatever hours you want.

06:47.738 --> 06:50.201
Don't even worry about, I don't
even really need an assistant.

06:50.202 --> 06:53.117
Hey, Vince, this is Rainer's assistant.

06:53.118 --> 06:55.328
I'm gonna go grab some water.

06:55.329 --> 06:57.672
Can you show her where to fill
out her paperwork and stuff?

06:57.673 --> 06:59.957
- Yeah.
- Great, love you, Cas.

07:01.579 --> 07:03.419
This is the one-liner
for the rest of the week.

07:03.420 --> 07:04.670
You'll get one in the production office.

07:04.671 --> 07:06.047
You know what a one-liner is, right?

07:06.048 --> 07:07.673
You need to make sure that
Paige has her sides every night.

07:07.674 --> 07:09.577
Make sure you check it
with the final call sheet

07:09.578 --> 07:10.718
that we'll issue at wrap.

07:10.719 --> 07:12.199
If Paige is late it'll be your fault.

07:12.200 --> 07:13.983
Also constantly check
your emails for any new

07:13.984 --> 07:16.182
script revisions or Wyatt
will be all up your ass.

07:16.183 --> 07:18.434
My ass?

07:18.435 --> 07:20.195
Hey, Adam, can you give
Paige's new assistant

07:20.196 --> 07:21.446
a ride to the production office

07:21.447 --> 07:23.970
so she can fill out her start paperwork?

07:32.449 --> 07:34.617
Did you know about this, Rainer?

07:34.618 --> 07:36.041
Did you know this was gonna happen?

07:36.042 --> 07:38.538
Was that why you were in Hong Kong?

07:38.539 --> 07:41.082
Slow down. Uh, what?

07:41.083 --> 07:42.917
God, you were always such a bad liar.

07:42.918 --> 07:45.628
I guess, now you're a bad friend, too.

07:45.629 --> 07:47.463
I tried to talk them out of it.

07:47.464 --> 07:49.298
It happened so fast that I-I..

07:49.299 --> 07:51.384
There was nothing I could do.

07:51.385 --> 07:53.845
What the hell happened?

07:53.846 --> 07:56.406
Tang, wait up. Come
on, stop. Stop, stop.

07:57.808 --> 08:01.453
- What did Rainer do?
- His mother fired me.

08:07.443 --> 08:09.610
Did you know about this?
Did Rainer tell you?

08:09.611 --> 08:11.154
No, I had no idea. What happened?

08:11.155 --> 08:13.239
They replaced me with
some girl from China.

08:13.240 --> 08:15.116
No, no way they're doin' this.

08:15.117 --> 08:16.741
I'm talkin' to Nina
about this right now.

08:16.742 --> 08:18.196
Why would she listen to you?

08:19.830 --> 08:22.165
'Cause she's Rainer's mom.
I've known her for a long...

08:22.166 --> 08:24.292
'Cause she couldn't
even tell me herself.

08:24.293 --> 08:27.253
You know why I think she did this? God..

08:27.254 --> 08:28.717
'Cause I cheated on Rainer with you.

08:28.718 --> 08:30.465
- No, I don't think so, Tang.
- Why else?

08:30.466 --> 08:33.509
Do you have any idea
how embarrassing this is?

08:33.510 --> 08:35.470
I've done tons of press for this movie.

08:35.471 --> 08:37.157
It's gonna look like
I suck as an actress.

08:37.158 --> 08:38.054
That's not true.

08:38.056 --> 08:39.857
Twitter's already saying
I don't know who I am

08:39.857 --> 08:41.285
'cause I wanna be a country artist.

08:41.287 --> 08:44.061
And then I got people saying
why does she wanna be an actress?

08:44.062 --> 08:46.397
God, this just proves them all right.

08:46.398 --> 08:49.817
Well, I don't know, I gotta
do somethin' about this.

08:49.818 --> 08:52.361
- You're not thinkin' about..
- No, I can't go back to my mom.

08:52.362 --> 08:55.507
I mean, I fought too
hard to get away from her.

08:56.366 --> 08:58.552
Alright, go out to the beach house.

08:59.244 --> 09:00.536
I'll meet you out there later.

09:00.537 --> 09:02.955
We'll hang out, we'll
grab dinner at Nobu.

09:02.956 --> 09:04.624
A change of scenery would do you good.

09:04.625 --> 09:06.648
Yeah, but maybe come to
the Chateau instead though.

09:06.649 --> 09:08.961
'Cause I do not want to
be anywhere near Rainer.

09:08.962 --> 09:10.129
Rainer's shooting all night.

09:10.130 --> 09:11.753
And I promised I'd
hang out at his place.

09:11.754 --> 09:14.634
He got some furniture being
delivered this afternoon.

09:14.635 --> 09:17.512
What? You're his assistant now?

09:17.513 --> 09:19.806
Someone robbed the place.

09:19.807 --> 09:21.783
My fault, I left the sliding door open.

09:23.477 --> 09:26.938
- Alright, fine.
- We'll figure this all out.

09:26.939 --> 09:28.147
I promise.

09:38.575 --> 09:39.909
So let me guess.

09:39.910 --> 09:42.495
You didn't tell Paige you
don't wanna be her assistant.

09:42.496 --> 09:46.165
Nope, I couldn't. She was so excited.

09:46.166 --> 09:47.834
Here's the paper work.

09:47.835 --> 09:49.627
I'll take you to the
production office now.

09:49.628 --> 09:51.063
You can start tomorrow.

09:52.631 --> 09:54.465
Maybe if you told her the real reason

09:54.466 --> 09:57.218
you don't want the job, she'd get it.

09:57.219 --> 09:59.446
Or maybe it would just
ruin our friendship.

10:13.193 --> 10:14.777
Oh, my God.

10:14.778 --> 10:16.779
Ben and Lauren from "The Bachelor."

10:16.780 --> 10:20.074
Wow! My roommate and I
we-we love you guys so much.

10:20.075 --> 10:21.701
We'd never miss an episode.

10:21.702 --> 10:23.703
- You're Paige Townsen, right?
- Yeah.

10:23.704 --> 10:26.581
Oh, my gosh. We were
just here for a meeting.

10:26.582 --> 10:27.707
And we thought we'd ask

10:27.708 --> 10:30.626
for a private tour of
the "Locked" stages.

10:30.627 --> 10:32.837
And Ben here's read the book six times.

10:32.838 --> 10:34.130
- Oh.
- What can I say?

10:34.131 --> 10:35.840
I'm a sucker for a great romance.

10:35.841 --> 10:36.966
- Wow.
- We gotta get going.

10:36.967 --> 10:38.593
But it was so good meeting you.

10:38.594 --> 10:40.970
A-awesome meeting you
guys. Congratulations.

10:40.971 --> 10:43.639
- Thanks, thank you so much.
- Wow.

10:43.640 --> 10:46.517
This is one of the
biggest stages on the lot.

10:46.518 --> 10:49.979
Jimmy Stewart, Audrey
Hepburn, Carrie Grant

10:49.980 --> 10:52.899
they all made movies right
where you're standing.

10:52.900 --> 10:55.610
I grew up on American movies.

10:55.611 --> 10:58.613
'I always wanted to see this.'

10:58.614 --> 11:00.757
Remember the favorite scene
you were telling me about?

11:00.758 --> 11:03.618
That, that one from "A Star
Is Born" with Judy Garland?

11:03.619 --> 11:05.202
'Filmed right here on this very stage.'

11:05.203 --> 11:07.038
I've been acting for ten years

11:07.039 --> 11:10.458
and every time I see new sets go up..

11:10.459 --> 11:12.501
It never gets old.

11:12.502 --> 11:15.212
Hey, hey, hey, Rainer.

11:15.213 --> 11:16.714
You look like you're feelin' better.

11:16.715 --> 11:19.634
- It must've been the jet lag.
- Must have been.

11:19.635 --> 11:21.552
I was just showing
our new co-star around.

11:21.553 --> 11:22.678
This is Xu Yifei.

11:22.679 --> 11:25.514
She's now playing the
part of the Time Sorceress.

11:25.515 --> 11:28.059
But that's..

11:28.060 --> 11:31.479
Great! Great!

11:31.480 --> 11:33.147
Oh, my goodness. Congratulations.

11:33.148 --> 11:34.273
So nice to meet you.

11:34.274 --> 11:35.942
Uh, Rainer's been so kind

11:35.943 --> 11:38.819
to give me a tour of
each and every stage

11:38.820 --> 11:41.697
where my favorite
American actors did scenes

11:41.698 --> 11:43.699
from my favorite movies.

11:43.700 --> 11:46.428
Uh, the history is enchanting.

11:48.288 --> 11:51.874
Yeah. I got that tour too.

11:51.875 --> 11:53.626
Okay, I guess I'll see you around.

11:53.627 --> 11:55.711
Uh, so nice to meet you.

11:55.712 --> 11:57.939
Now, where's my trailer again?

11:59.591 --> 12:01.801
'It's just a few minor changes.'

12:01.802 --> 12:06.222
That's Mike's copy. He didn't
really feel the love story.

12:06.223 --> 12:07.682
Okay.

12:07.683 --> 12:09.558
I, I thought Mike
Tanen loved the script.

12:09.559 --> 12:11.602
Oh, he does. Really, he does.

12:11.603 --> 12:13.896
But we all agree that the script needs

12:13.897 --> 12:17.525
a little more work before we can
move to green light the project.

12:17.526 --> 12:18.859
Okay, but, um..

12:18.860 --> 12:21.362
Speak of the devil,
that's Mike right now.

12:21.363 --> 12:23.215
I need to take this.

12:25.951 --> 12:28.178
- Okay, don't freak out.
- I'm not.

12:29.329 --> 12:31.664
Okay, I am. A little.

12:31.665 --> 12:33.666
I'm not afraid of putting the work in.

12:33.667 --> 12:36.002
I just don't even know what they want.

12:36.003 --> 12:38.504
I think they wanna take the
love triangle out completely.

12:38.505 --> 12:39.880
Just don't take it personally.

12:39.881 --> 12:42.258
They just have to put their
stamp on it to make their own.

12:42.259 --> 12:44.945
It's, it's like how
they justify their jobs.

12:46.346 --> 12:49.515
Sorry about that. I've gotta run.

12:49.516 --> 12:51.225
It was so great meeting you, Jake.

12:51.226 --> 12:52.643
Yeah, you too.

12:52.644 --> 12:55.604
- I'm gonna go grab the car.
- Great.

12:55.605 --> 12:58.691
- Are you two..
- No, of course not.

12:58.692 --> 13:00.151
We were just working on the script

13:00.152 --> 13:02.653
and came straight from the office.

13:02.654 --> 13:05.489
Well, I'm so glad to have you
on this project as a producer.

13:05.490 --> 13:06.574
Thank you.

13:06.575 --> 13:09.744
Which leads me to our
next piece of business.

13:09.745 --> 13:10.848
The casting of your co-star

13:10.849 --> 13:13.581
is going to be crucial
to getting this made.

13:13.582 --> 13:15.124
Here is our list.

13:15.125 --> 13:17.501
We're hoping you might
have relationships

13:17.502 --> 13:18.852
with some of those actresses.

13:18.853 --> 13:21.130
Let's see. Um..

13:21.131 --> 13:25.009
Won't leave New York. In
rehab. Should be in rehab.

13:25.010 --> 13:27.219
Cannot act.

13:27.220 --> 13:28.679
Wait, Rachel, Rachel Davis?

13:28.680 --> 13:30.181
Do you know Rachel Davis?

13:30.182 --> 13:32.058
Yes. But she's quite a handful...

13:32.059 --> 13:34.685
Mike Tanen is obsessed.

13:34.686 --> 13:36.729
He can't stop raving
about her since he saw her

13:36.730 --> 13:38.773
in that indie film that
premiered at South-by.

13:38.774 --> 13:40.608
She's got a real cult following.

13:40.609 --> 13:42.818
Yeah, no. I just..

13:42.819 --> 13:44.570
I don't think that she's great for it.

13:44.571 --> 13:47.114
You know, she just got,
she got recast a lot.

13:47.115 --> 13:50.868
Hmm, our target audience
is completely different.

13:50.869 --> 13:52.036
And Tanen likes her today

13:52.037 --> 13:53.829
so if I were you, I'd run with it.

13:53.830 --> 13:55.331
If you can attach Rachel Davis

13:55.332 --> 13:57.458
you might get your film off the ground.

13:57.459 --> 13:58.727
Okay.

14:12.724 --> 14:14.868
'Hello? Excuse me?'

14:17.062 --> 14:19.772
Who the hell are you?

14:19.773 --> 14:22.066
I'm Jordan's girlfriend.
Who the hell are you?

14:22.067 --> 14:23.710
I'm Jordan's mother.

14:29.154 --> 14:31.479
Jordan's parents are dead
so I don't know who you are

14:31.480 --> 14:33.022
or what you want but you need to..

14:33.023 --> 14:34.416
I'm calling 911.

14:35.526 --> 14:38.486
Don't, she's tellin' the truth.

14:38.487 --> 14:39.487
I left you a message.

14:39.488 --> 14:41.447
I told you to not come back here!

14:41.448 --> 14:43.407
- Jordan, what is goin' on?
- You need to leave.

14:43.408 --> 14:45.993
I need to talk to you. It's an
emergency or I wouldn't be here.

14:45.994 --> 14:47.846
It's always an emergency.

14:48.580 --> 14:49.931
Don't move.

14:51.500 --> 14:53.000
Your mother?

14:53.001 --> 14:55.504
Baby, listen, I'll tell you what
you need to know, but not now.

14:55.505 --> 14:57.463
All those times you
told me how sad you were

14:57.464 --> 14:58.881
that you don't have your parents.

14:58.882 --> 15:01.342
Jordan, you've lied to me.

15:01.343 --> 15:02.444
God!

15:07.516 --> 15:08.724
I hope you're happy.

15:08.725 --> 15:11.602
About what? Your new little girlfriend?

15:11.603 --> 15:14.438
Famous pop star. She's cute too.

15:14.439 --> 15:17.608
- Good for you.
- About messin' up my life.

15:17.609 --> 15:18.810
It seems to be your specialty.

15:18.811 --> 15:20.274
I didn't know she was gonna be here.

15:20.275 --> 15:21.237
Why are you here?

15:21.238 --> 15:23.114
There's nothing left
for you to take, mom.

15:23.115 --> 15:26.701
- Aden's bookie has it.
- Aden?

15:26.702 --> 15:28.327
Why are you dealin' with Aidan's bookie?

15:28.328 --> 15:30.496
Every debt Aidan owed, I now owe.

15:30.497 --> 15:32.623
But why? They're not yours to pay back.

15:32.624 --> 15:34.542
Because they think I killed him, Jordie.

15:34.543 --> 15:36.460
Would you like me to
tell them the truth?

15:36.461 --> 15:39.005
Why should I believe you, mom?

15:39.006 --> 15:40.606
First it was the 50k for the nail salon.

15:40.630 --> 15:42.925
- Then the furniture..
- There's no nail salon.

15:42.926 --> 15:44.552
Ever since I got done servin' time

15:44.553 --> 15:46.429
they've been after me to pay it back.

15:46.430 --> 15:49.515
And if I don't come
up with all the money..

15:49.516 --> 15:51.100
...they're gonna kill me.

15:55.689 --> 15:57.940
Sorry. Excuse me.

15:57.941 --> 16:01.527
Oh, uh... sorry.

16:01.528 --> 16:05.489
You see, few people know that
the first use of paper currency

16:05.490 --> 16:08.367
dates all the way back
to seventh century, China.

16:08.368 --> 16:10.095
The Tsang Dynasty.

16:10.871 --> 16:13.557
Hi. Sorry. So sorry.

16:19.630 --> 16:21.273
'Let us continue.'

16:22.215 --> 16:24.025
How much is this dollar worth?

16:26.136 --> 16:27.219
Yes.

16:27.220 --> 16:28.721
It's the base unit of US currency.

16:28.722 --> 16:31.265
It's value is set by the Federal Reserve

16:31.266 --> 16:33.351
and is tied to the consumer price index.

16:33.352 --> 16:35.311
Actually, it's worth nothing.

16:35.312 --> 16:36.788
'It's just a piece of paper.'

16:37.564 --> 16:39.857
It's value comes in trade.

16:39.858 --> 16:42.860
You see, this instrument
allowed ancient societies

16:42.861 --> 16:45.321
to shift from primitive barter economies

16:45.322 --> 16:46.906
'to sophisticated modern markets.'

16:46.907 --> 16:48.949
That's what the Chinese figured out.

16:48.950 --> 16:51.327
But I'd like someone to cite an instance

16:51.328 --> 16:54.723
of the rise of a modern barter economy.

16:56.583 --> 16:58.727
Anyone?

17:01.171 --> 17:03.506
- Yes.
- It was just last year.

17:03.507 --> 17:05.257
Greece, during their economic crisis.

17:05.258 --> 17:07.527
Precisely. Thank you.

17:08.553 --> 17:11.012
'Moving on to chapter four.'

17:19.481 --> 17:20.749
Rachel.

17:21.775 --> 17:23.483
What the hell are you doing here?

17:23.484 --> 17:25.569
Look, this is my yoga
class. Find another one.

17:25.569 --> 17:28.406
Relax, as much as I enjoy
getting a workout with you.

17:28.406 --> 17:30.533
- I'm not here to sweat.
- Look, I'm already late.

17:30.534 --> 17:31.909
Rach, please, just here me out.

17:31.910 --> 17:33.261
It'll only take a second.

17:34.788 --> 17:38.416
You sound desperate
and I'm curious. What?

17:38.417 --> 17:40.459
I came to give you this script.

17:40.460 --> 17:42.281
There's a part in it
that's perfect for you.

17:43.964 --> 17:45.673
Uh-huh. And what's in it for you?

17:45.674 --> 17:48.110
- I'm producing it.
- Really?

17:49.428 --> 17:50.720
"Jake Salt?"

17:50.721 --> 17:52.739
Wait, isn't that Paige Townsen's friend?

17:53.807 --> 17:56.243
Let me guess, you're screwin' him too.

17:57.728 --> 17:59.204
Rachel, wait.

18:05.861 --> 18:07.542
I'm trying to tell you what happened.

18:07.543 --> 18:08.779
You don't need to, I
already figured it out.

18:08.780 --> 18:10.406
We've been friends for a decade.

18:10.407 --> 18:12.658
I'd never do anything to
intentionally hurt you.

18:12.659 --> 18:14.493
- You know that.
- So it's true then.

18:14.494 --> 18:15.953
You slept with August.

18:15.954 --> 18:18.205
Cut on rehearsal.

18:18.206 --> 18:21.208
Guys, let's let the stunt
doubles throw the punches.

18:21.209 --> 18:23.252
Why? I don't need a
double. Man, I can do it.

18:23.253 --> 18:24.420
It's like a six foot drop.

18:24.421 --> 18:26.547
Listen, I'm the stunt coordinator.

18:26.548 --> 18:28.215
It's and eight feet drop
and we've been over this.

18:28.216 --> 18:29.216
You know what happens to actors

18:29.217 --> 18:30.301
who do their own stunts?

18:30.302 --> 18:31.965
Their movies don't
look like crap in post?

18:31.966 --> 18:33.804
Lawsuits.

18:33.805 --> 18:35.907
You're an insurance liability, Rainer.

18:41.104 --> 18:42.271
I'd be happy to perform this

18:42.272 --> 18:43.856
death defying leap anytime you want.

18:43.857 --> 18:45.375
Alright, wise guy.

18:48.737 --> 18:51.238
- Sorry about Tangey.
- Why didn't you say anything?

18:51.239 --> 18:52.865
Honestly, it wasn't my place to.

18:52.866 --> 18:54.950
I was also kinda hoping
since my mom stayed behind

18:54.951 --> 18:57.620
she would've worked somethin' out.

18:57.621 --> 19:00.289
But know, I had nothing to do with it.

19:00.290 --> 19:02.684
Tangey was just starting
to tolerate me again.

19:04.002 --> 19:05.753
It was all my mom.

19:05.754 --> 19:07.097
I don't know why she was so quick

19:07.098 --> 19:08.991
to get Tangey off the movie.

19:09.841 --> 19:11.526
Why do you think she would do that?

19:12.844 --> 19:14.637
I have no idea.

19:24.439 --> 19:27.441
Geez, Alexis, what are
you stalking me now?

19:27.442 --> 19:29.735
I follow you on IG,
Snapchat and Facebook.

19:29.736 --> 19:32.488
- It's better than GPS.
- What do you want?

19:32.489 --> 19:35.616
- I want you to apologize to me.
- That's rich.

19:35.617 --> 19:37.868
Okay, you know what?

19:37.869 --> 19:40.621
I am sleeping with Jake.

19:40.622 --> 19:43.415
But that only because you
chose to think the worst of me.

19:43.416 --> 19:46.669
God! Go back to therapy already, okay?

19:46.670 --> 19:47.920
What are you going on about?

19:47.921 --> 19:50.047
I didn't get you fired off of "Locked."

19:50.048 --> 19:51.799
It had nothing to do with me.

19:51.800 --> 19:54.426
Yet you were right there
without ever even asking

19:54.427 --> 19:57.030
without even, I don't know,
checking to see if it were true.

20:00.183 --> 20:02.768
Alright. Yeah, you're right.

20:02.769 --> 20:04.937
When my agents told me
that you didn't get me fired

20:04.938 --> 20:06.480
I should have called and apologized.

20:06.481 --> 20:08.732
You knew and you didn't
say anything to me?

20:08.733 --> 20:10.734
It wasn't the only
thing I was upset about.

20:10.735 --> 20:13.404
I mean, you never give
us a chance, as a couple.

20:13.405 --> 20:16.323
Rachel, maybe I let my agents

20:16.324 --> 20:19.261
and managers and press
mess too much with my head.

20:20.954 --> 20:24.206
My career is built on
being the girl next door.

20:24.207 --> 20:27.293
And even though it's 2017

20:27.294 --> 20:28.878
everyone knows that the girl next door

20:28.879 --> 20:30.838
is supposed to be with boy next door.

20:30.839 --> 20:32.339
But don't you get it?

20:32.340 --> 20:34.383
I mean, no one cares
about that stuff anymore.

20:34.384 --> 20:37.011
Maybe, it was just easier
to use that as an excuse

20:37.012 --> 20:39.614
than admitting my career was over.

20:43.935 --> 20:45.412
Olive branch?

20:48.523 --> 20:52.443
All I'm asking is that you
just read Jake Salt's script.

20:52.444 --> 20:53.819
Honestly, it's really good

20:53.820 --> 20:56.047
and it would be good for both of us.

20:57.741 --> 21:00.218
Alright. I'll read it.

21:01.786 --> 21:03.120
So sell some stocks or whatever

21:03.121 --> 21:04.538
do whatever it takes.

21:04.539 --> 21:06.808
I need to take care of this
right away, get it done!

21:08.418 --> 21:09.936
Hey.

21:11.713 --> 21:14.743
Thought I might find out here,
they're ready for us inside.

21:18.303 --> 21:19.946
Is everything cool?

21:24.017 --> 21:27.829
Couldn't help but hearing.
You in some money trouble?

21:29.940 --> 21:31.916
You know you're like
a brother to me, right?

21:32.901 --> 21:34.419
Of course.

21:35.862 --> 21:37.505
I wouldn't ask this if didn't have to.

21:38.573 --> 21:40.675
I need to get some money
and mine is all tied up.

21:40.909 --> 21:42.868
Say no more.

21:42.869 --> 21:44.346
How much do you need?

21:45.914 --> 21:47.515
Seven hundred fifty.

21:49.084 --> 21:50.477
Thousand?

21:52.337 --> 21:53.921
For that amount, I at least get to hear

21:53.922 --> 21:55.482
what kinda trouble you're in.

21:57.634 --> 21:59.343
You're one of the few who know my story.

21:59.344 --> 22:01.613
- I know, man.
- The real one.

22:02.597 --> 22:04.074
Yeah, man, I-I know, your mom..

22:05.475 --> 22:06.892
What a nightmare.

22:06.893 --> 22:08.102
Yeah, well..

22:08.103 --> 22:10.938
This time, it isn't exactly her fault.

22:10.939 --> 22:12.856
You know, when my mom
and I first moved here

22:12.857 --> 22:15.001
we started grifting for
this Irish dude, Hayden.

22:15.819 --> 22:18.028
Then he was her boyfriend.

22:18.029 --> 22:20.781
- Then he moved in with us.
- Hmm.

22:20.782 --> 22:22.085
He was alright when he was sober

22:22.086 --> 22:24.785
but he was hardly ever sober.

22:24.786 --> 22:26.328
He started knocking her around.

22:26.329 --> 22:30.874
First it was occasionally
then it was more... and more.

22:30.875 --> 22:33.919
Me too sometimes. But mostly her.

22:33.920 --> 22:36.922
Watching your mom take
that kind of abuse everyday

22:36.923 --> 22:39.943
having to hear her apologize,
as if she deserved it.

22:43.763 --> 22:45.426
One night, I was in
my room doin' homework

22:45.427 --> 22:47.308
and it started up.

22:47.309 --> 22:50.060
He kept goin' after her

22:50.061 --> 22:53.623
and he wouldn't stop and... I snapped.

22:54.941 --> 22:56.668
I grabbed a bat, just to warn him.

22:58.028 --> 23:02.072
You know, my only thought
was to get him off of her.

23:02.073 --> 23:04.884
I wasn't tryin' to but he
moved or something and..

23:05.994 --> 23:07.470
...that was it.

23:09.998 --> 23:11.266
The bat connected.

23:14.919 --> 23:16.229
I killed him.

23:21.092 --> 23:22.801
I, I don't even know, what to say.

23:22.802 --> 23:25.262
I have to help my mom.

23:25.263 --> 23:27.740
I can't leave her with
that when it was my fault.

23:38.860 --> 23:41.254
- Hey!
- Cass.

23:42.655 --> 23:45.741
Hey, I-I did not think
that you were gonna be home.

23:45.742 --> 23:48.285
'I know, I swore that I
wasn't gonna do this anymore'

23:48.286 --> 23:50.537
but I got a call from one
of my regular customers.

23:50.538 --> 23:53.207
He's a total nice guy,
always pays me really well

23:53.208 --> 23:55.459
and I just desperately needed the money.

23:55.460 --> 23:57.920
But I, I thought, we were
working on the movie together.

23:57.921 --> 24:01.507
I'm sorry, I just think that
it's gonna be too many hours.

24:01.508 --> 24:03.926
Okay, but I-I really don't understand

24:03.927 --> 24:05.344
why after all you've been through

24:05.345 --> 24:07.471
you would go back to that.

24:07.472 --> 24:10.391
Um... because they're just boobs.

24:10.392 --> 24:11.975
Most actresses have to show theirs

24:11.976 --> 24:13.185
at some point in their career.

24:13.186 --> 24:15.354
They're just lucky to
get paid more to do it.

24:15.355 --> 24:17.898
Not respected actresses.

24:17.899 --> 24:21.402
Okay, you're totally judging
me right now. You know that.

24:21.403 --> 24:25.948
No, no, I, I, I didn't
mean it like that.

24:25.949 --> 24:27.467
I-it came off wrong.

24:28.118 --> 24:29.636
I just..

24:33.039 --> 24:35.517
I don't understand.

24:36.668 --> 24:38.961
I mean, topless cleaning?

24:38.962 --> 24:41.130
You just don't get it, do you?

24:41.131 --> 24:44.591
No, uh, no, obviously, I, I
don't. Please help me get it.

24:44.592 --> 24:47.177
I don't have parents who
pay for my college, for one.

24:47.178 --> 24:49.012
I have huge debts from school

24:49.013 --> 24:51.348
which is why I've had to
pawn everything that I own.

24:51.349 --> 24:53.100
And I'll help you with your debts.

24:53.101 --> 24:54.524
You don't even have to pay me back.

24:54.525 --> 24:56.061
I have enough money now, Cass.

24:56.062 --> 24:57.646
- Stop feeling sorry for me.
- Hey!

24:57.647 --> 24:59.731
I don't feel sorry for you, dude.

24:59.732 --> 25:01.876
I just wanted to help
you with your fees.

25:02.861 --> 25:04.486
What? What? What?

25:04.487 --> 25:06.798
What could I have done wrong now?

25:08.199 --> 25:10.617
Why can't you get that
maybe I don't wanna watch you

25:10.618 --> 25:13.721
live out my dream day
after day after day?

25:15.582 --> 25:17.207
Don't you get that?

25:17.208 --> 25:21.044
I'm so sorry I asked
you to be my assistant.

25:21.045 --> 25:23.565
I'm so sorry but you know what?

25:25.091 --> 25:28.510
I'm even sorrier that
I'd let you drag me

25:28.511 --> 25:30.196
to that stupid audition.

25:31.139 --> 25:32.764
News flash, Cassie.

25:32.765 --> 25:34.975
You begged me to do it.

25:34.976 --> 25:36.759
What, you're just gonna
hate your best friend

25:36.760 --> 25:37.895
now that I-I got it?

25:37.896 --> 25:39.789
Because I didn't think that you would!

25:40.690 --> 25:42.191
I'm the theatre major!

25:42.192 --> 25:44.568
But you, you just, you
just waltzed right in

25:44.569 --> 25:47.070
and you got it.

25:47.071 --> 25:50.216
Like everything you
do, it's just so easy.

25:58.541 --> 25:59.708
You're right.

25:59.709 --> 26:02.812
'Cause everything's just so easy for me.

26:11.471 --> 26:12.804
You okay?

26:25.726 --> 26:27.643
You okay? Because we don't have to.

26:27.644 --> 26:29.663
No, no, no, I'm ready. Let's do this.

26:30.814 --> 26:31.939
'W-w-w-whoa!'

26:31.940 --> 26:34.025
No stunts, okay, buddy? Come on.

26:34.026 --> 26:35.317
It's easily doable, Alan.

26:35.318 --> 26:37.611
Well, the thing is, I
can't be in the business

26:37.612 --> 26:38.738
of hurting my stars.

26:38.739 --> 26:40.406
'Besides, you're not even 21.'

26:40.407 --> 26:43.367
- Let's go.
- I'm 23.

26:43.368 --> 26:45.411
No, you're 20th birthday
bash at the Marquee

26:45.412 --> 26:47.163
was all over TMZ last summer.

26:47.164 --> 26:49.415
Yeah, my mom shaved
three years off my age

26:49.416 --> 26:51.208
at the first audition
she ever took me to.

26:51.209 --> 26:53.229
Thought it would help me
get parts in my forties.

26:54.254 --> 26:56.881
Huh. Alright, well,
always thinking ahead.

26:56.882 --> 26:58.924
Come on, let's roll.

26:58.925 --> 27:01.635
- Go with me, I'm doing it.
- Throw the punch.

27:01.636 --> 27:02.859
'Let's roll cameras.'

27:02.860 --> 27:05.723
You yell cut before that punch.

27:05.724 --> 27:09.226
- 'Scene five, take one.'
- And action!

27:09.227 --> 27:11.955
So it's true then you slept with August.

27:14.900 --> 27:16.442
Aah!

27:16.443 --> 27:17.777
- Oh. Oh.
- Oh.

27:17.778 --> 27:19.504
God! What the... hey!

27:21.823 --> 27:23.341
See, easy.

27:25.035 --> 27:27.536
Dammit, Rainer, I told you, what?

27:27.537 --> 27:30.206
Relax, Alan. It's in my blood.

27:30.207 --> 27:31.248
- You know that.
- What?

27:31.249 --> 27:33.834
My dad was a stunt man.

27:33.835 --> 27:35.795
He worked in that movie
with you and my mom.

27:35.796 --> 27:38.297
Uh, the one in Morocco. Back in '93.

27:38.298 --> 27:40.650
- Steve Channing?
- Steve Channing.

27:41.885 --> 27:44.345
No, don't remember him.

27:44.346 --> 27:47.193
But I do remember that film. It was..

27:47.194 --> 27:48.724
Goodnight.

27:59.319 --> 28:00.629
Jake?

28:01.780 --> 28:03.656
Hey.

28:03.657 --> 28:05.884
- Do you wanna come sit?
- Sure.

28:08.829 --> 28:11.163
Did you, um..

28:11.164 --> 28:13.165
Did you get to see
Cassie before you left?

28:13.166 --> 28:15.185
No. I think she went to Adam's.

28:17.003 --> 28:18.295
Wow. I'm such an idiot.

28:18.296 --> 28:19.759
I don't know how I didn't look at it

28:19.760 --> 28:20.798
from her perspective.

28:20.799 --> 28:24.343
I mean, she was so excited all the time

28:24.344 --> 28:26.929
I just figured..

28:26.930 --> 28:29.014
...she was okay with all of it.

28:29.015 --> 28:30.182
She is excited for you.

28:30.183 --> 28:32.643
I don't know but maybe she's right.

28:32.644 --> 28:34.562
Maybe I didn't deserve any of this.

28:34.563 --> 28:37.523
The film, the role, just... any of it.

28:37.524 --> 28:39.567
No, it's not it.

28:39.568 --> 28:40.877
You deserve it, Paige.

28:44.781 --> 28:47.008
So take that part out of the equation.

28:50.954 --> 28:52.830
That's math you can probably do.

28:55.876 --> 28:57.936
It's the only math I can do.

29:04.217 --> 29:06.343
You ready for your test?

29:06.344 --> 29:10.890
I cannot cram anything
else in so I really hope so.

29:10.891 --> 29:12.933
How's your script by the way?

29:12.934 --> 29:16.896
When am I going to get
to read it, if ever?

29:16.897 --> 29:18.720
I mean, who knows if it
will be the same story

29:18.721 --> 29:21.275
by the time I'm done changing
it to make them happy.

29:21.276 --> 29:22.860
Maybe I shouldn't have sold it.

29:22.861 --> 29:27.132
Jake, selling a screenplay
while you're still in college?

29:27.866 --> 29:31.136
That's huge.

29:32.746 --> 29:36.099
- Yeah. I guess it is.
- Yeah. It is.

29:37.500 --> 29:38.935
So crazy.

29:40.670 --> 29:43.106
All our dreams are coming true but..

29:45.091 --> 29:47.801
...if all that went away
tomorrow and we just went back

29:47.802 --> 29:50.721
to being college students.

29:50.722 --> 29:52.431
Would it really be that bad?

29:52.432 --> 29:53.950
No. It wouldn't.

29:54.809 --> 29:56.310
No.

29:56.311 --> 29:57.620
Oh, wow.

30:01.524 --> 30:03.943
Here's your pie. Enjoy.

30:03.944 --> 30:05.503
Hmm. Thank you.

30:09.866 --> 30:11.033
Are you stress eating?

30:11.034 --> 30:15.621
I ordered, uh, one slice
for everyone on the menu.

30:15.622 --> 30:17.957
Man, I've always wanted to do this.

30:17.958 --> 30:20.668
Mm, and what ever is left over

30:20.669 --> 30:22.170
we can always take home for Cassie.

30:23.004 --> 30:24.064
Alright.

30:35.934 --> 30:38.310
Okay, this is so good.

30:38.311 --> 30:39.954
Mm. Mm, my God.

30:43.441 --> 30:45.668
Do I have something on my face?

30:50.532 --> 30:52.157
You didn't get it, did you?

31:20.145 --> 31:21.687
What are you doin' here, ma?

31:21.688 --> 31:24.023
I'm here 'cause you're
screwin' everything up.

31:24.024 --> 31:26.400
And I worked too hard to
let you throw it all away.

31:26.401 --> 31:28.986
I have contacted some other managers.

31:28.987 --> 31:30.904
I will work this out.

31:30.905 --> 31:32.489
You don't need to pay another manager

31:32.490 --> 31:33.782
to work things out!

31:33.783 --> 31:35.951
Tangey, nobody knows you

31:35.952 --> 31:37.995
or your career better than me.

31:37.996 --> 31:40.873
And what with the press
havin' a field day..

31:40.874 --> 31:42.416
...over why you were replaced.

31:42.417 --> 31:44.043
You don't have the luxury of time

31:44.044 --> 31:45.586
to hire somebody else.

31:45.587 --> 31:47.463
I didn't ask for your help.

31:47.464 --> 31:49.798
You didn't have to.

31:49.799 --> 31:51.258
I'm your mother.

31:51.259 --> 31:54.344
Listen, Tange, I know you're grown.

31:54.345 --> 31:56.388
And I know we have had our differences.

31:56.389 --> 31:58.182
So you ask yourself

31:58.183 --> 32:00.326
as much as you've
hated to hear the truth.

32:01.144 --> 32:02.770
How many times have I been right?

32:02.771 --> 32:04.438
Okay. You've been right. So what?

32:04.439 --> 32:07.316
So I can get you back
on this movie is what.

32:07.317 --> 32:10.027
Nina owes me.

32:10.028 --> 32:11.945
She promised me you
would be on this film.

32:11.946 --> 32:13.572
And let me guess.

32:13.573 --> 32:15.556
She didn't even have the
guts to tell you herself.

32:15.557 --> 32:16.909
They're paying me.

32:16.910 --> 32:18.535
Of course, they're payin' you!

32:18.536 --> 32:20.579
And they'll do a whole
lot more than that.

32:20.580 --> 32:22.164
Now shut the door.

32:22.165 --> 32:24.068
We gotta sit down and
get ready for our meeting.

32:24.069 --> 32:27.544
I don't want you to
be my manager anymore!

32:27.545 --> 32:29.568
If that means I have to
deal with this by myself...

32:29.569 --> 32:32.007
Fine! Fine.

32:32.008 --> 32:33.258
Just think of this as, um

32:33.259 --> 32:35.570
me finishin' the job I already started.

32:37.722 --> 32:40.974
Sit down. Please.

32:43.603 --> 32:44.645
- Watch this.
- Okay.

32:44.646 --> 32:45.869
- Hit up. There you go.
- Okay.

32:48.525 --> 32:49.858
Okay, there you go.

32:54.572 --> 32:58.784
Can I, uh, talk to you
for a minute? Alone?

32:58.785 --> 33:01.221
- I'll catch up with you later.
- Absolutely.

33:04.749 --> 33:06.809
- What's up?
- What's up?

33:07.739 --> 33:09.711
What's up is that you're
supposed to be rehearsing

33:09.712 --> 33:11.797
that dance number with me.

33:11.798 --> 33:14.716
Rainer, I can't afford
to screw this up. Okay?

33:14.717 --> 33:18.470
So... I guess what I'm asking you

33:18.471 --> 33:21.974
is to stop, stop blowing me off.

33:21.975 --> 33:23.976
Like how you blew me off in Vegas?

33:23.977 --> 33:25.185
'Oh.'

33:25.186 --> 33:27.980
For a friend crisis, which honestly

33:27.981 --> 33:30.107
didn't seem like much of
a friend crisis at all.

33:30.108 --> 33:32.776
Considering all the
missing friends were present

33:32.777 --> 33:33.777
and accounted for.

33:33.778 --> 33:36.363
So that's it then, huh?

33:36.364 --> 33:39.717
First time I say no to you,
this is how you treat me?

33:41.661 --> 33:45.164
God, Rainer, grow up! Seriously.

33:45.165 --> 33:47.916
My friends needed me
and I was there for them.

33:47.917 --> 33:49.835
That's why I turned you down.

33:49.836 --> 33:53.130
And if I don't get to, you
know, take private fancy jets

33:53.131 --> 33:56.091
to amazing, weird places,
then cool, whatever.

33:56.092 --> 33:58.051
I don't care.

33:58.052 --> 34:01.889
If you don't understand that
you've just proven my point.

34:01.890 --> 34:05.142
This is exactly why I
didn't wanna date you.

34:19.886 --> 34:21.737
Hello.

34:23.098 --> 34:25.558
You surprised me, Miss Townsen.

34:25.559 --> 34:27.101
You're the only one in class

34:27.101 --> 34:29.186
to get a hundred percent on the exam.

34:29.187 --> 34:31.563
I studied a lot.

34:31.565 --> 34:32.731
Yeah. It shows.

34:32.732 --> 34:34.567
It's a shame that you
wait until the semester

34:34.568 --> 34:37.485
was almost over to put
the effort in for my class

34:37.487 --> 34:40.906
because even if you get a
perfect score on the final.

34:40.907 --> 34:44.784
The best I can give you
is a C in this class.

34:44.786 --> 34:46.289
But if you reconsider and take a look

34:46.290 --> 34:47.913
at my midterm paper..

34:47.914 --> 34:49.857
- We've been over this, Miss...
- I know, I know.

34:49.858 --> 34:51.876
I don't accept papers
after the deadline.

34:51.877 --> 34:53.752
Everyone else managed
to get theirs in on time.

34:53.753 --> 34:55.588
It wouldn't be fair
to the other students.

34:55.589 --> 34:58.799
Right, right. Completely
understand that.

34:58.800 --> 35:01.427
But I really put

35:01.428 --> 35:05.389
so much work into this paper.

35:05.390 --> 35:08.475
Please, just consider
taking a look at it.

35:08.476 --> 35:10.477
Um, both my parents are teachers.

35:10.478 --> 35:12.897
So I understand how much hard work

35:12.898 --> 35:15.858
you put into your lesson plans and..

35:15.859 --> 35:18.736
Oh, are those your daughters?

35:18.737 --> 35:20.779
The one on the right is. Amelia.

35:20.780 --> 35:23.782
'She's 13 now. That's
her best friend as well.'

35:23.783 --> 35:25.326
They look so close like me

35:25.327 --> 35:29.973
and... my best friend... were.

35:30.165 --> 35:31.957
Hmm.

35:31.958 --> 35:33.167
Are we done here?

35:33.168 --> 35:36.754
Is Amelia a fan of "The
Locked" books by any chance?

35:36.755 --> 35:38.964
My daughter is a fan.

35:38.965 --> 35:41.675
Well, great, 'cause I learned a lot

35:41.676 --> 35:44.803
about barter and trade
this semester in your class.

35:44.804 --> 35:48.807
Miss Hawkins, what if..

35:48.808 --> 35:53.896
...I could arrange a set visit
for Amelia and her best friend?

35:53.897 --> 35:56.482
Would you consider taking a
look at my paper and allowing it

35:56.483 --> 35:58.918
to still count for 25%
percent of my grade?

36:00.737 --> 36:02.571
The most I can do is 15%.

36:02.572 --> 36:05.282
What if I throw in a selfie
with Rainer Devon? Twenty?

36:05.283 --> 36:07.701
Isn't Jordan Wilder in that film?

36:07.702 --> 36:09.365
Selfies with both of
them but I would have

36:09.366 --> 36:12.122
to stay firm at a 25%.

36:17.035 --> 36:20.640
_

36:27.138 --> 36:28.740
'What's up? You warmed?'

36:29.975 --> 36:32.369
Uh, yeah. I'm ready.

36:33.687 --> 36:36.522
And let me guess, uh,
Rainer didn't show up again.

36:36.523 --> 36:37.749
I'm here.

36:46.074 --> 36:47.658
Alright, let's do this.

36:47.659 --> 36:49.868
'Alright, now we can work.'

36:49.869 --> 36:51.638
'Now, get to your startin' positions.'

36:55.583 --> 36:59.920
Now, remember, dance is
about the give and take.

36:59.921 --> 37:01.424
You gotta be generous with each other

37:01.425 --> 37:02.715
to make this dance come to life.

37:02.716 --> 37:04.842
Which means..

37:04.843 --> 37:08.554
'...you gotta feel what
the other one needs.'

37:08.555 --> 37:11.074
Hmm? Where do y'all wanna take it from?

37:12.892 --> 37:14.661
I think I need more work than Paige.

37:18.231 --> 37:19.999
Let's take it from the top.

37:22.819 --> 37:25.029
Five, six, seven, eight..

38:18.500 --> 38:20.018
I like it.

38:22.045 --> 38:23.253
Wanna come in?

38:23.254 --> 38:26.632
But what I like even more
is that you're the producer.

38:26.633 --> 38:28.256
Maybe instead of looking at this project

38:28.257 --> 38:29.635
as staying in the acting game.

38:29.636 --> 38:31.236
You could look at producing as something

38:31.260 --> 38:33.180
you could do long term.

38:33.181 --> 38:36.725
So, um, does this little pep talk

38:36.726 --> 38:39.019
mean that you're
interested in the movie?

38:39.020 --> 38:41.188
- I'm interested.
- Great.

38:41.189 --> 38:43.315
I'll get us another
glass and we'll celebrate.

38:43.316 --> 38:46.461
I'll sign on to the
film on one condition.

38:47.487 --> 38:50.823
It needs a rewrite. A major rewrite.

38:50.824 --> 38:53.492
Actually, Jake's already got
a set of notes from Newcastle

38:53.493 --> 38:54.660
and is hard at work.

38:54.661 --> 38:56.662
Not Jake.

38:56.663 --> 38:59.081
I've got Kevin O'Hare,
the Pulitzer Prize winning

38:59.082 --> 39:01.667
playwright to agree
to do a full rewrite.

39:01.668 --> 39:03.335
He's been dying to break into Hollywood

39:03.336 --> 39:05.188
and he's wildly talented.

39:11.261 --> 39:12.904
Thank you. Now get out.

39:48.298 --> 39:49.965
- You need something?
- No.

39:49.966 --> 39:51.469
But I got acquainted with your mother

39:51.470 --> 39:52.551
when she needed something.

39:52.552 --> 39:54.095
My mother passed away a long time ago.

39:54.096 --> 39:55.429
You can drop the act, Jordon.

39:55.430 --> 39:56.973
When Brandy Michaels needed bail money

39:56.974 --> 39:59.141
she was pretty eager to chat.

39:59.142 --> 40:01.005
I know she didn't say
anything to you, Barrett.

40:01.006 --> 40:02.227
She didn't have to.

40:02.228 --> 40:04.146
I know all about little Jordy Michaels

40:04.147 --> 40:06.148
but a man's grasp
should exceed his reach.

40:06.149 --> 40:08.984
There's a bigger story about
your involvement with Brandy.

40:08.985 --> 40:12.613
And the man she killed.
Was it Aidan McGhee?

40:12.614 --> 40:13.906
Your mother didn't want to talk to me.

40:13.907 --> 40:15.199
But, um, I'm giving you a chance

40:15.200 --> 40:16.658
to come clean so how about it?

40:18.536 --> 40:21.389
Do yourself a favor and
stay the hell away from me.

40:24.167 --> 40:26.561
If you don't tell me the
truth, someone else will!

40:27.212 --> 40:29.129
Someone always does.
