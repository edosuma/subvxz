00:10.878 --> 00:12.511
Places, everyone.

00:12.546 --> 00:15.714
In five, four, three, two...

00:20.287 --> 00:22.788
My next guest
needs no introduction.

00:22.823 --> 00:24.022
From cookbooks

00:24.057 --> 00:25.623
to a successful line of decor,

00:25.692 --> 00:27.825
her name is synonymous
with home.

00:27.861 --> 00:30.928
She is the Queen of Crafts,
the Dame of Decoupage.

00:30.964 --> 00:32.363
Liz Livingstone!

00:34.134 --> 00:36.434
Dana!

00:36.469 --> 00:39.404
You look amazing.

00:39.472 --> 00:40.638
<i>Merry Christmas.</i>

00:40.673 --> 00:42.306
<i>And you know what,</i>

00:42.342 --> 00:44.053
<i>it will be a merry Christmas
for our audience today</i>

00:44.077 --> 00:46.044
<i>because you're gonna be
showing us how to do</i>

00:46.079 --> 00:48.046
<i>a truly show-stopping
gingerbread house!</i>

00:48.081 --> 00:49.613
<i>That's right.</i>

00:49.681 --> 00:51.192
<i>Take a look at all these
wonderful ingredients.</i>

00:51.216 --> 00:53.216
I can do this.

00:53.285 --> 00:54.818
Yeah.

00:54.853 --> 00:56.486
<i>My personal favourite,
jelly beans.</i>

00:56.522 --> 00:59.089
<i>And melted caramel candies</i>

00:59.124 --> 01:01.925
<i>make wonderful
stained glass windows.</i>

01:01.994 --> 01:03.193
<i>Be careful.
They're fragile.</i>

01:04.296 --> 01:05.695
Shoot.

01:05.731 --> 01:07.171
<i>And next...
you're gonna love this...</i>

01:07.199 --> 01:09.766
<i>- I'm making a scalloped roof.
- Okay.</i>

01:09.802 --> 01:11.413
<i>But you can also use
candy wafers for shingles.</i>

01:11.437 --> 01:13.836
No. No-no-no-no!

01:15.973 --> 01:17.640
<i>- How's that?
- Very nice.</i>

01:17.675 --> 01:20.843
<i>And...</i>

01:20.912 --> 01:23.279
<i>finish it all off with a
dusting of powdered sugar.</i>

01:23.314 --> 01:25.281
<i>It's snowing!</i>

01:25.349 --> 01:27.583
<i>Snowing indeed.</i>

01:27.652 --> 01:29.018
<i>You know what?</i>

01:29.053 --> 01:30.364
<i>The most important thing
is to have fun</i>

01:30.388 --> 01:32.254
<i>and make it your own.</i>

01:32.290 --> 01:34.290
<i>Liz, it's perfect.</i>

01:34.325 --> 01:35.858
Perfect.

01:35.893 --> 01:37.237
<i>Be sure to pick up
the latest issue</i>

01:37.261 --> 01:38.661

01:53.477 --> 01:54.477
Hi, Mom.

01:54.511 --> 01:55.844
Hurry up, sweetheart.

01:55.912 --> 01:57.713
We're gonna be late
for the party.

01:57.735 --> 01:59.279
Is that flour on your neck?

02:04.446 --> 02:06.657
How did the royal icing
come out this time?

02:06.722 --> 02:07.760
Not so great.

02:07.856 --> 02:10.088
<i>Next time add a splash
of lemon juice.</i>

02:20.169 --> 02:22.736
<i>This is Anna
from Livingstone Magazine</i>

02:22.771 --> 02:25.005
and if you are just joining us,

02:25.040 --> 02:28.074
<i>we are live from the annual
Livingstone Magazine</i>

02:28.143 --> 02:29.775
Christmas party.

02:29.811 --> 02:32.345
And, yes.

02:32.413 --> 02:35.915
Those are Liz's signature
snowflake pancakes.

02:35.950 --> 02:38.317
Hello, everyone.

02:38.353 --> 02:42.755
Welcome to the 21st annual
Livingstone Christmas party.

02:42.790 --> 02:44.257
Woo!

02:44.292 --> 02:45.925
We are here to celebrate

02:45.960 --> 02:48.561
another wonderful year
at the Livingstone company,

02:48.596 --> 02:52.465
and it is my honour to introduce
the woman of the hour,

02:52.499 --> 02:54.699
our fearless leader

02:54.768 --> 02:58.270
and my mom, Liz Livingstone.

03:04.178 --> 03:06.144
Thank you, Candace.

03:06.180 --> 03:10.282
Well, this has always been
my favourite event of the year.

03:10.317 --> 03:14.052
I get to show my true gratitude
to all of you

03:14.087 --> 03:16.154
who make this company
what it is.

03:16.190 --> 03:17.821
And to our board of directors,

03:17.857 --> 03:20.457
along with
our wonderful chairman,

03:20.493 --> 03:22.560
James Carlyle, who flew in
all the way from Chicago

03:22.595 --> 03:25.829
to be with us here
to celebrate tonight.

03:27.400 --> 03:29.366
I say thank you.

03:37.176 --> 03:39.121
There was an announcement
that I was planning on saving

03:39.145 --> 03:41.645
until the new year
but with you here, together,

03:41.681 --> 03:44.414
I think this might be
the right time after all.

03:46.451 --> 03:49.052
This will be my last year
as acting CEO.

03:49.087 --> 03:52.222
I'm stepping away but I know it will be
in good hands with all of you.

03:52.290 --> 03:55.992
So, let's make this next year
the best one yet.

03:57.662 --> 03:58.861
Merry Christmas to you all.

04:09.306 --> 04:10.772
You're retiring?

04:10.808 --> 04:12.419
Well, I've been thinking
about it for a while now.

04:12.443 --> 04:14.209
And it just feels like
the right time.

04:14.245 --> 04:16.644
What's the Livingstone brand
without Liz Livingstone?

04:16.680 --> 04:18.180
I agree.

04:18.214 --> 04:21.083
The Livingstone brand
needs a Livingstone,

04:21.118 --> 04:23.752
which is why I'm suggesting you
as my replacement.

04:23.787 --> 04:24.787
Me?

04:24.855 --> 04:26.255
Well, who better?

04:26.323 --> 04:28.490
You've been at the magazine
for five years,

04:28.525 --> 04:30.626
you know the business side
inside and out.

04:30.661 --> 04:33.628
Well, yeah, but working
behind the scenes though

04:33.663 --> 04:36.998
is worlds different than being
the face of the entire brand!

04:37.033 --> 04:41.535
I've always dreamed that
you would take over from me.

04:41.604 --> 04:43.437
I built this for you, Candace.

04:47.644 --> 04:48.854
Well, not exactly
the announcement

04:48.878 --> 04:51.178
they were expecting.

04:51.214 --> 04:53.848
I better go
put some minds at ease.

04:53.883 --> 04:55.750
I'll be back in a moment.

05:04.226 --> 05:07.160
How are we gonna replace her?

05:08.730 --> 05:09.996
I'm not sure that we can.

05:10.032 --> 05:13.433
She's someone
that people really admire.

05:13.502 --> 05:15.468
You know, when they buy
her cookie cutters

05:15.504 --> 05:17.937
or try one of the recipes
from the magazine,

05:17.973 --> 05:19.083
what they're really trying to do

05:19.107 --> 05:20.118
is they're trying to be...

05:20.142 --> 05:22.374
Be just like her.

05:22.410 --> 05:25.544
Exactly.

05:25.579 --> 05:28.981
And that is a tough act
to follow.

05:29.016 --> 05:30.316
Oh, I agree.

05:36.857 --> 05:38.691
Are you okay?

05:56.976 --> 05:58.376
You know what?

05:58.411 --> 05:59.855
I feel like the shadows
are a little harsh.

05:59.879 --> 06:01.490
Do you think we could diffuse
the light a bit?

06:01.514 --> 06:02.514
Okay.

06:02.549 --> 06:03.848
And in here,

06:03.883 --> 06:05.261
Candace is overseeing
the photo shoot.

06:05.285 --> 06:07.352
A four course Christmas dinner.

06:07.420 --> 06:10.455
And it looks delicious,

06:10.523 --> 06:12.823
but hasn't the Christmas edition
already gone to print?

06:12.858 --> 06:14.358
Yes.
This is for the website.

06:14.393 --> 06:15.892
Our readers
will be able to click

06:15.961 --> 06:19.329
on any item in the photo
and go to a video tutorial.

06:19.365 --> 06:21.732
What's this?
This is spectacular!

06:21.767 --> 06:23.800
Well, we're gonna be
shooting this next.

06:23.836 --> 06:25.268
All of our social media accounts

06:25.337 --> 06:26.715
are going to have
a gingerbread house a day

06:26.739 --> 06:27.804
to countdown to Christmas.

06:27.840 --> 06:29.639
I made Christmas Eve

06:29.675 --> 06:31.441
and Candace's will be
Christmas Day.

06:31.477 --> 06:32.943
- You made one too?
- Yes.

06:32.978 --> 06:34.211
I would love to see it.

06:34.246 --> 06:35.946
It's not quite finished yet.

06:36.014 --> 06:37.558
Perfectionist?
Just like your mother?

06:37.582 --> 06:40.850
Yeah.

06:40.885 --> 06:42.730
Where do you want the
Christmas Day gingerbread house?

06:42.754 --> 06:45.955
You can leave it
right there. That's fine.

06:48.025 --> 06:49.025
This?

06:50.962 --> 06:52.039
This is your gingerbread house?

06:52.063 --> 06:54.130
Yes, well...

06:54.165 --> 06:55.442
It was a bit of a rough ride
over here

06:55.466 --> 06:56.899
in the cab this morning.

06:56.934 --> 06:58.734
It was... a lot of potholes.

07:04.674 --> 07:06.775
I...

07:06.810 --> 07:09.244
I... I like
the peppermint wreath.

07:11.448 --> 07:12.759
I think it has
a lot of character.

07:12.783 --> 07:15.784
It just needs
a little sprucing up.

07:36.172 --> 07:37.571
- Candace.
- Yeah?

07:37.606 --> 07:38.872
Do you have a minute?

07:38.908 --> 07:40.352
There's something
I think you'll wanna see.

07:40.376 --> 07:41.675
Sure.

07:46.048 --> 07:48.449
This was posted yesterday.

07:48.517 --> 07:51.317
It has been shared
nearly 30,000 times since then.

07:51.352 --> 07:52.985
<i>Hi, Mrs. Livingstone.</i>

07:53.021 --> 07:54.954
<i>My name is Harper
and I'm a really big fan.</i>

07:54.989 --> 07:57.290
<i>My dad is currently
stationed overseas.</i>

07:57.325 --> 07:58.758
<i>He's in the army</i>

07:58.793 --> 08:00.404
<i>and whenever we send him
a care package,</i>

08:00.428 --> 08:02.562
<i>we always include
Livingstone ginger snaps.</i>

08:02.630 --> 08:06.432
<i>He said it reminds him
of being here with all of us.</i>

08:06.468 --> 08:08.348
<i>I'm making this video
because I just found out</i>

08:08.403 --> 08:11.370
<i>that my dad will be coming home
on December 20th,</i>

08:11.406 --> 08:13.005
<i>just in time for Christmas!</i>

08:13.041 --> 08:15.974
<i>So we're throwing him
a welcome home party</i>

08:16.009 --> 08:17.876
<i>and I really want it
to be perfect,</i>

08:17.945 --> 08:20.712
<i>and I know you're the
one person who could help us.</i>

08:20.747 --> 08:22.514
<i>So, if you can make it,</i>

08:22.549 --> 08:25.684
<i>I know it would be
just the best surprise ever!</i>

08:28.722 --> 08:30.255
A real hero's welcome.

08:30.290 --> 08:32.034
You could be there
to greet him with the family!

08:32.058 --> 08:34.458
And maybe you could even make
those cookies that he loves.

08:34.528 --> 08:36.072
And then we could feature
this whole trip

08:36.096 --> 08:38.129
in next month's issue.

08:38.164 --> 08:40.465
I think it's a terrific idea.

08:40.501 --> 08:42.566
No. Wait.

08:42.602 --> 08:45.369
I'm gonna be in Aspen
at the charity fundraiser.

08:45.404 --> 08:47.671
I'm already committed.

08:49.542 --> 08:51.942
- You could go.
- Alone?

08:51.978 --> 08:53.477
You could take Anna!

08:53.513 --> 08:55.246
It sounds like a lot of people

08:55.281 --> 08:58.749
are following this story
on social media.

08:58.784 --> 09:00.251
We could give them
a happy ending.

09:00.286 --> 09:01.886
But she asked for you, Mom.

09:01.921 --> 09:03.287
If you're gonna
take over from me,

09:03.322 --> 09:04.822
we're gonna have to get
the approval

09:04.857 --> 09:06.189
of the board of directors

09:06.258 --> 09:09.692
and currently,
they have some reservations.

09:09.728 --> 09:12.662
This would go a long way in
showing them that you're ready.

09:13.865 --> 09:15.698
Okay.

09:37.321 --> 09:38.520
We're here.

09:38.556 --> 09:40.956
That's a lot of notes.

09:40.991 --> 09:42.624
This is just the menu.

09:42.660 --> 09:44.426
Look at this.
She even drew diagrams.

09:44.461 --> 09:45.661
At least you're well prepared.

09:48.566 --> 09:50.165
All right.

09:50.200 --> 09:52.534
Let's do this.

09:55.905 --> 09:57.138
I don't know, though.

09:57.206 --> 09:58.684
Do you think maybe
we should've called first?

09:58.708 --> 10:00.675
No, the surprise
is part of the fun.

10:00.710 --> 10:03.010
This way we'll get a real,
genuine reaction from them.

10:03.046 --> 10:04.712
All right.

10:04.781 --> 10:07.782
What if that real, genuine
reaction is disappointment?

10:09.719 --> 10:12.253
They're gonna be
so excited to see you.

10:12.322 --> 10:13.721
Just watch.

10:13.756 --> 10:15.022
Okay.

10:18.995 --> 10:22.028
Wait, wait. Wait.

10:22.064 --> 10:23.263
Okay, you ready?

10:23.298 --> 10:24.531
- Remember to smile.
- Okay.

10:30.772 --> 10:32.472
Hello, can I help you?

10:32.541 --> 10:34.074
Yes, hi.
I'm here to see Harper.

10:34.109 --> 10:36.109
- I'm Candace Liv...
- Livingstone!

10:36.178 --> 10:38.578
Liz's daughter, of course!

10:38.647 --> 10:41.815
Yes, yes, I recognize you
from the magazine!

10:41.850 --> 10:43.350
Come in, come in.

10:43.385 --> 10:44.385
Okay.

10:44.419 --> 10:45.851
Come on.

10:47.421 --> 10:48.721
Thank you.

10:48.756 --> 10:50.823
She will be over the moon
to see you!

10:50.858 --> 10:53.325
I told her that the video
was a long shot

10:53.361 --> 10:55.394
but she was so determined

10:55.429 --> 10:57.463
to make her father's homecoming
extra special.

10:59.333 --> 11:01.634
This is a lovely home.

11:01.669 --> 11:02.901
Would it be possible

11:02.970 --> 11:04.436
to open these curtains?

11:04.472 --> 11:05.949
I think the natural light
would help the shot.

11:05.973 --> 11:07.773
This is Anna.

11:07.808 --> 11:10.108
She's our social media manager
for the magazine.

11:10.143 --> 11:11.821
She's gonna be taking
some photos and videos

11:11.845 --> 11:13.122
of the homecoming
if you don't mind?

11:13.146 --> 11:15.013
Well, of course!

11:16.650 --> 11:17.915
I'll just get Harper.

11:17.951 --> 11:19.295
- She's upstairs with her mother.
- Okay.

11:19.319 --> 11:22.587
Oh, please,
make yourselves at home.

11:22.622 --> 11:23.755
Thank you.

11:26.526 --> 11:28.126
See? You had nothing
to worry about.

11:32.932 --> 11:36.433
This must be Harper's dad.

11:36.502 --> 11:38.535
You came! You really came!

11:38.570 --> 11:40.537
Hi, Harper!
How are you, honey?

11:40.606 --> 11:42.339
So nice to meet you.

11:42.408 --> 11:43.551
This is Jane,
my daughter-in-law.

11:43.575 --> 11:44.541
- Hi.
- Harper's mother.

11:44.576 --> 11:45.809
Hi!

11:45.878 --> 11:49.413
I can't believe
you're actually here!

11:49.481 --> 11:51.048
Well, we saw Harper's video

11:51.116 --> 11:53.350
and we wanted to be a part
of this very special day.

11:53.419 --> 11:55.252
I have a surprise for you.

11:55.287 --> 11:59.522
Here is... a box

11:59.557 --> 12:01.891
of my mother's famous
homemade ginger snap cookies.

12:01.959 --> 12:03.871
And she's very sorry that
she couldn't be here today.

12:03.895 --> 12:05.761
She really wanted to come.

12:05.797 --> 12:07.296
It's okay. You're here!

12:07.331 --> 12:09.098
Well, we have boxes

12:09.133 --> 12:11.367
of decorations
and desserts in the car

12:11.402 --> 12:12.935
so that we can help you plan

12:12.970 --> 12:14.348
your picture perfect
Christmas party.

12:14.372 --> 12:17.006
Well, you've come
at the perfect time!

12:17.041 --> 12:19.141
Steve's not due back
for another couple of hours

12:19.177 --> 12:21.310
and we've only just started
getting ready. So...

12:21.379 --> 12:22.778
We're gonna bake him a cake

12:22.847 --> 12:24.527
and when he gets here
we're all gonna hide!

12:25.716 --> 12:27.649
Harper's been
planning this for weeks.

12:27.684 --> 12:30.618
She's worked so hard
to make it a surprise.

12:30.654 --> 12:32.174
That'll be the cake!

12:32.222 --> 12:35.190
I am gonna go to the car
and get some more boxes.

12:45.535 --> 12:47.035
No, no, no.

12:47.070 --> 12:48.837
No, you're not supposed
to be here yet.

12:48.872 --> 12:50.370
I'm sorry?

12:50.406 --> 12:52.350
Look, I don't have time
to explain right now

12:52.374 --> 12:54.074
but I need you
to get back in your car

12:54.110 --> 12:55.950
and just drive around
for maybe like 15 minutes

12:55.978 --> 12:57.745
and then when you come back,
act surprised.

12:57.780 --> 12:59.257
Just... let's...
hold on a second here.

12:59.281 --> 13:00.281
Who are you?

13:00.316 --> 13:01.348
I'm Candace!

13:01.383 --> 13:03.217
Livingstone.

13:03.285 --> 13:05.786
My mom is Liz Livingstone?
You love her cookies?

13:05.821 --> 13:07.621
You're selling cookies.

13:07.656 --> 13:09.389
No, no... No, I'm not
selling anything.

13:09.425 --> 13:11.391
So you're giving them away.

13:11.427 --> 13:12.493
There are no cookies.

13:12.528 --> 13:14.127
It's... I'm here, for you.

13:14.162 --> 13:15.561
You're here for me?

13:15.597 --> 13:16.597
Yeah. I'm your surprise.

13:16.631 --> 13:17.631
Surprise!

13:17.665 --> 13:18.898
Uncle John!

13:18.933 --> 13:21.067
Hey, Harp!

13:21.102 --> 13:22.869
How are ya?!

13:22.904 --> 13:24.504
Look who's here.
It's Candace.

13:24.539 --> 13:26.117
I sent a video to help
surprise Dad, and she came!

13:26.141 --> 13:28.374
This is my uncle John.

13:28.443 --> 13:29.742
- There we go.
- Yes.

13:29.778 --> 13:31.077
- Hi.
- Hi.

13:31.112 --> 13:32.556
- Nice to meet you.
- Yeah, you as well.

13:32.580 --> 13:34.447
I'm so sorry.
I thought you were Steve.

13:34.516 --> 13:36.048
Right.

13:36.084 --> 13:37.216
Younger brother.

13:37.252 --> 13:38.451
I get that a lot.

13:38.486 --> 13:39.486
Yeah.

13:39.520 --> 13:40.585
Hey, is Grandma home?

13:40.621 --> 13:41.953
She's in the kitchen.

13:41.989 --> 13:43.299
Come on, you need to see
the cake we made!

13:43.323 --> 13:44.856
Okay. I'm comin' in
right away!

13:44.892 --> 13:46.224
That is, if it's okay with you.

13:46.260 --> 13:47.993
Of course.
Please, be my guest.

13:48.028 --> 13:49.161
I'm allowed now.

13:49.196 --> 13:50.829
- You are allowed, yes.
- That's good.

13:50.864 --> 13:53.098
I did a great job, Candace.

13:53.133 --> 13:54.833
You know, in my defence,

13:54.902 --> 13:56.701
that picture
was very misleading.

14:02.509 --> 14:06.310
- What's going on?
- Steve's flight was delayed.

14:07.647 --> 14:09.815
- What time does he get in?
- Thursday.

14:09.849 --> 14:13.017
Thursday. That's...
That's Christmas Eve.

14:13.052 --> 14:14.451
I'm sorry.

14:14.487 --> 14:16.253
Seems you came
all this way for nothing.

14:16.289 --> 14:17.922
Don't apologize.

14:17.957 --> 14:20.090
I'm glad I got to come out here
and meet you all.

14:20.126 --> 14:22.526
No, but you can't go!
We need you!

14:22.562 --> 14:24.094
Are you gonna come back?

14:24.163 --> 14:26.363
Harper, we can't ask Candace

14:26.399 --> 14:28.998
to give us any more time
from her busy schedule.

14:29.034 --> 14:31.267
Popping in today was already
incredibly generous.

14:31.303 --> 14:33.036
Martha?

14:33.071 --> 14:36.005
I'm sorry to drop in unannounced

14:36.041 --> 14:37.218
but everyone down
at the town hall...

14:37.242 --> 14:39.475
- Hey. You want some coffee?
- Yeah.

14:39.511 --> 14:42.278
...chipped in to buy Steve
a little welcome home gift.

14:42.314 --> 14:43.413
Is he here?

14:43.448 --> 14:45.548
Thank you, that is very kind

14:45.584 --> 14:48.651
but I'm afraid there's been
a slight change of plans.

14:48.687 --> 14:50.954
Steve won't be back
until Christmas Eve.

14:50.989 --> 14:54.656
- That's too bad.
- Thanks.

14:58.028 --> 15:00.662
This is Candace Livingstone!

15:00.698 --> 15:03.866
And Candace, this is
our beloved Mayor Walsh.

15:03.934 --> 15:06.168
I thought you looked familiar.

15:06.237 --> 15:10.339
I'm a big fan of your magazine.

15:10.374 --> 15:12.408
- I'm very pleased to meet you!
- Yes, you too.

15:13.844 --> 15:15.355
Candace was here
helping with Steve's party.

15:15.379 --> 15:19.046
So does this mean you'll be sticking
around our little town for a while?

15:19.082 --> 15:20.815
Can you?

15:20.850 --> 15:23.117
Well, you've come all this way.

15:23.152 --> 15:24.719
Let us extend to you

15:24.754 --> 15:28.122
some good, old-fashioned
Cedar Falls hospitality.

15:29.192 --> 15:30.491
Well, I wouldn't want you

15:30.560 --> 15:32.126
to go to all that trouble
just for me.

15:32.195 --> 15:36.564
Our town takes great pride
in its Christmas calendar.

15:36.633 --> 15:38.466
In fact, there's a lot
of wonderful events

15:38.501 --> 15:40.301
that I think will be
right up your alley.

15:42.238 --> 15:43.270
How so?

15:43.305 --> 15:47.274
Well, the crafts fair,
the cookie stand,

15:47.342 --> 15:49.843
the gingerbread house
competition.

15:51.647 --> 15:55.382
I would like for you to attend
them all as my guest of honour!

15:57.352 --> 15:59.052
Please, Candace?

16:04.359 --> 16:05.458
Who could say no to that?

16:07.129 --> 16:09.061
Wonderful! Wonderful!

16:09.096 --> 16:12.898
We are going to make the next
four days ones you'll never forget!

16:12.967 --> 16:14.466
I'm sure!

16:22.209 --> 16:24.388
Hey, Mom. Just give me a call
back whenever you get this.

16:24.412 --> 16:26.278
Okay?
Talk to you later.

16:30.484 --> 16:32.062
That was really nice,
what you did back there.

16:32.086 --> 16:33.284
Offering to stay for Harper.

16:33.353 --> 16:34.430
It's kinda hard to tell her no.

16:34.454 --> 16:35.887
Oh, believe me. I know.

16:35.922 --> 16:37.789
Last week I took her
to get a Christmas tree

16:37.824 --> 16:39.735
and we came back with ornaments
for the entire family

16:39.759 --> 16:41.039
and a pound of peppermint fudge.

16:42.228 --> 16:43.428
Is this it?

16:43.463 --> 16:45.196
That's the one.
The Inn on Holly Drive.

16:45.231 --> 16:47.899
You turn left by the town hall.
You can't miss it.

16:47.934 --> 16:50.134
They make their own egg nog.
Highly recommended.

16:50.170 --> 16:52.670
You should both come over
tomorrow for breakfast.

16:52.706 --> 16:54.906
Oh, gosh, I...
wouldn't wanna put you out.

16:54.941 --> 16:56.619
You wouldn't be putting us out.
We'd love to have you!

16:56.643 --> 16:58.775
Well, all right then.
We will be here.

16:58.844 --> 17:02.045
I hope I'll be seeing you too.

17:02.081 --> 17:03.425
We have the gingerbread
competition

17:03.449 --> 17:05.015
and then we'll be
decorating the tree.

17:05.084 --> 17:07.127
Sorry, I can't. I gotta get
to the paper early tomorrow.

17:07.152 --> 17:08.585
I thought it was your day off.

17:08.619 --> 17:10.065
When have you ever known him
to take a day off?

17:10.089 --> 17:11.989
- The paper?
- Yeah. John's a reporter

17:12.023 --> 17:13.991
...at the Cedar Falls Gazette.

17:14.026 --> 17:16.292
Well, I hope you'll have time
for the festival.

17:16.328 --> 17:17.361
You can't miss that.

17:17.429 --> 17:19.296
I will try.

17:19.330 --> 17:20.364
Scout's honour.

17:20.398 --> 17:22.932
Promise.

17:23.001 --> 17:24.900
- It was nice to meet you.
- You too.

17:24.969 --> 17:26.535
And we'll see you guys later.

17:26.570 --> 17:27.703
- Okay.
- All right.

17:27.771 --> 17:28.938
I can take that.

17:28.973 --> 17:30.117
You wanna go back in?
It's cold!

17:30.141 --> 17:31.440
- All right, you ready?
- Bye!

17:37.648 --> 17:39.181
- Hello.
- Hi.

17:39.217 --> 17:40.616
Welcome to the Inn
on Holly Drive.

17:40.651 --> 17:41.651
The name, please?

17:41.686 --> 17:42.952
Livingstone.

17:42.987 --> 17:45.621
I actually don't have
any reservations.

17:45.690 --> 17:48.023
I was wondering if you might
have two rooms available

17:48.058 --> 17:49.224
for the next four nights?

17:49.292 --> 17:50.658
I realize it's last minute,

17:50.694 --> 17:52.927
but the trip
was a little unexpected.

17:52.963 --> 17:56.464
You're in luck, Miss...
Livingstone?

17:58.835 --> 18:01.236
Candace Livingstone.
Liz Livingstone's daughter!

18:01.304 --> 18:03.471
Yeah, that's me.

18:03.507 --> 18:06.007
How exciting!

18:07.577 --> 18:09.177
A celebrity in our little town!

18:09.212 --> 18:10.745
Wait right there.

18:15.551 --> 18:16.984
Hey!

18:17.019 --> 18:18.152
Flights are rescheduled.

18:18.220 --> 18:19.386
Do they have any open rooms?

18:19.422 --> 18:21.422
Look, we have your pillows.

18:21.457 --> 18:23.490
Yes, you do.

18:23.526 --> 18:28.028
Your mother just has
the most amazing taste.

18:28.097 --> 18:31.098
In, well, everything!

18:31.133 --> 18:34.501
But of course,
you need reservations.

18:34.537 --> 18:35.702
Let's get you in the book.

18:35.738 --> 18:39.105
Livingstone...

18:40.475 --> 18:43.443
All right.

18:43.478 --> 18:45.278
Follow me and I'll show you
to your rooms.

18:45.346 --> 18:46.346
Okay.

18:46.381 --> 18:47.381
You can keep the pillow.

18:49.851 --> 18:51.918
There you go.

18:57.192 --> 19:01.494
We spotlight different traditions
from different countries.

19:01.529 --> 19:03.128
Christmas across the globe.

19:03.163 --> 19:06.331
We're a local paper, John.
We cover local stories.

19:06.400 --> 19:07.777
Right, but it's a big world
out there.

19:07.801 --> 19:09.279
I mean, don't you think
we should be bringing

19:09.303 --> 19:11.436
a little bit of that
into our readers' homes?

19:11.505 --> 19:13.171
We have a travel section.

19:13.207 --> 19:15.474
Betsy just got back
from Niagara Falls.

19:15.509 --> 19:17.976
In fact, she's got a wonderful
write-up in today's edition.

19:18.011 --> 19:20.479
Pictures, too.

19:20.547 --> 19:22.325
What about that winter
tournament basketball game...

19:22.349 --> 19:24.049
- ....I gave you?
- It's on your desk.

19:24.084 --> 19:26.184
- And the booster club fundraiser?
- Finished, Ben.

19:26.220 --> 19:27.751
I'm a good reporter.

19:27.787 --> 19:30.154
I know I could be
doing bigger things.

19:30.223 --> 19:32.289
What about Candace Livingstone?

19:32.358 --> 19:35.025
Livingstone.

19:35.061 --> 19:37.294
The... the...
Queen of the Crafts lady?

19:37.330 --> 19:38.662
Her daughter.

19:38.698 --> 19:40.598
My niece sent in a video
asking her to come

19:40.633 --> 19:44.902
and help welcome my brother Steve
home for Christmas and she came.

19:44.937 --> 19:47.505
Tell me more.

19:52.410 --> 19:54.110
<i>Anna sent me that video.</i>

19:54.146 --> 19:56.279
<i>You made
that little girl's year.</i>

19:56.314 --> 19:57.847
Mom, what is all that banging?

19:57.883 --> 19:59.382
I thought you were
at the ski lodge.

20:00.685 --> 20:02.285
Well, I was talking to the owner

20:02.320 --> 20:04.487
and he said he'd never had
an almond dacquoise.

20:04.523 --> 20:06.489
Well I happened to have
a wonderful recipe

20:06.558 --> 20:07.602
<i>so I thought I'd whip one off.</i>

20:07.626 --> 20:08.725
Of course you did.

20:08.760 --> 20:09.959
That's a sponge cake, right?

20:09.995 --> 20:12.095
No, sweetheart.
That's a Genoise.

20:12.164 --> 20:14.297
<i>Just a sec.</i>

20:14.332 --> 20:16.177
You're going to carefully
fold that into the chocolate.

20:16.201 --> 20:18.267
Thank you.
So...

20:18.302 --> 20:20.369
<i>I had a fabulous idea.</i>

20:20.404 --> 20:21.804
Instead of going back
to the office,

20:21.839 --> 20:23.405
why don't you fly out here?

20:23.440 --> 20:24.985
<i>There's a few people
I'd like you to meet.</i>

20:25.009 --> 20:26.686
Well, there's been
a slight change of plans.

20:26.710 --> 20:28.477
- I'm staying.
- You're staying?

20:28.512 --> 20:31.780
Yeah. Harper's dad Steve doesn't
get in until Christmas Eve now

20:31.815 --> 20:34.583
so that's actually
why I was calling.

20:34.618 --> 20:36.885
I was hoping maybe
you could meet me tomorrow?

20:36.954 --> 20:38.887
Sweetheart, I'd love to
but they've asked me

20:38.956 --> 20:40.589
<i>to stay on
an extra couple of days.</i>

20:40.624 --> 20:42.557
They're auctioning off
a lunch with me.

20:43.626 --> 20:45.126
<i>Listen.</i>

20:45.195 --> 20:48.362
I'll do my best
to get there as soon as I can.

20:48.398 --> 20:49.475
Just hold down the fort, okay?

20:49.499 --> 20:50.698
Okay.

20:50.767 --> 20:51.767
<i>Hey.</i>

20:51.801 --> 20:53.067
I love you.

20:53.102 --> 20:54.302
Bye, Mom.

20:54.337 --> 20:55.636
<i>Bye.</i>

20:59.108 --> 21:01.075
My mom said that she'll be here
as soon as she can

21:01.144 --> 21:03.678
but for now we're on our own.

21:03.713 --> 21:05.746
Did I just make a huge mistake?

21:05.782 --> 21:07.280
So we're here
for a few extra days.

21:07.316 --> 21:09.249
What could go wrong?

21:10.886 --> 21:12.953
Candace. Candace, will you
sign my cookbook, please?

21:12.988 --> 21:14.854
Mrs. Deevers,

21:14.890 --> 21:17.157
did you tell people
that I was staying here?

21:17.192 --> 21:20.093
Of course not.

21:20.128 --> 21:22.929
But word travels fast
in a small town.

21:27.302 --> 21:28.835
It might be good for the site.

21:28.904 --> 21:30.870
- Will you sign my cookbook please?
- Absolutely.

21:30.906 --> 21:32.938
Your mom is amazing.
I love her.

21:33.007 --> 21:34.540
This is amazing.

21:44.052 --> 21:46.518
Candace?
Are you okay?

21:47.555 --> 21:49.054
What am I gonna do?

21:49.123 --> 21:52.625
It is one thing to take
some pictures with a family

21:52.660 --> 21:54.426
with a carefully written
set of instructions

21:54.462 --> 21:55.906
but it a whole other
to be the guest of honour

21:55.930 --> 21:57.406
at some entire town's
Christmas festival!

21:57.430 --> 21:58.663
You could always cancel.

21:58.698 --> 22:02.000
- I can't do that!
- Why not?

22:02.035 --> 22:03.601
Because my mother
is recommending me

22:03.637 --> 22:04.637
as her replacement

22:04.671 --> 22:06.371
and she wants me
to use this trip

22:06.406 --> 22:08.117
to make a good impression
on the board of directors.

22:08.141 --> 22:12.076
She has built her entire legacy
on perfection and I...

22:12.145 --> 22:13.845
...I'm anything but!

22:15.382 --> 22:16.681
Nobody expects you
to be perfect.

22:16.750 --> 22:18.950
Cedar Falls certainly does!

22:22.321 --> 22:24.288
You know my mom's
snowflake pancakes?

22:24.323 --> 22:25.323
Yeah, of course!

22:25.357 --> 22:26.456
Who doesn't?

22:27.860 --> 22:31.862
Okay. She used to make those
for me and my dad every Christmas.

22:31.897 --> 22:34.197
Well, one Christmas
she had the flu.

22:34.233 --> 22:36.199
So I thought I would go
downstairs to the kitchen

22:36.235 --> 22:38.001
and surprise everybody
and make them myself.

22:38.037 --> 22:39.336
What happened?

22:39.371 --> 22:41.972
I burnt the whole first batch!

22:42.007 --> 22:43.874
The second batch
was completely lumpy.

22:43.909 --> 22:46.342
The third batch
was the worst one of all!

22:46.377 --> 22:49.512
Well, kids burn things
all the time.

22:49.547 --> 22:51.314
Anna, I was 17.

22:51.349 --> 22:53.282
What did your mother say?

22:54.385 --> 22:56.585
I never told her!

22:56.621 --> 22:58.032
I mean, I'm the Liz
Livingstone's daughter

22:58.056 --> 23:01.490
and I can't even make a pancake?

23:01.526 --> 23:03.292
I was so embarrassed!

23:03.328 --> 23:06.162
And she always made this
look so easy!

23:06.230 --> 23:09.398
It just never was for me.

23:10.535 --> 23:12.000
What I'm saying

23:12.035 --> 23:13.813
is that the more time
I spend here in Cedar Falls

23:13.837 --> 23:15.503
under a microscope,

23:15.539 --> 23:18.306
the more opportunities I have
to screw everything up.

23:18.375 --> 23:20.108
And my mom is counting
on me for this.

23:20.143 --> 23:22.344
I can't afford
to let her down.

23:25.515 --> 23:28.450
So...

23:28.485 --> 23:30.418
you fake it.

23:30.454 --> 23:31.953
Fake it?

23:32.022 --> 23:33.688
Yeah.

23:33.724 --> 23:37.057
You've been watching your mother
for years now.

23:37.126 --> 23:39.159
You don't need to be
the Queen of Crafts.

23:39.195 --> 23:40.435
You just need to play the part.

23:41.897 --> 23:44.198
That's what I've been trying
to do my entire life.

23:44.233 --> 23:46.567
All you need to do is get
through the next four days.

23:46.602 --> 23:47.735
And I will be here to help!

23:47.803 --> 23:50.104
You really think I can do this?

23:50.139 --> 23:52.439
Sure.

23:52.475 --> 23:53.674
We just need a game plan.

23:53.743 --> 23:55.376
All right.

23:58.013 --> 24:01.447
Well, first thing I'm gonna need
is some winter clothes.

24:07.756 --> 24:11.691
You need a pair of these.

24:11.726 --> 24:13.025
Definitely.

24:33.547 --> 24:35.914
Red's a good colour on you.

24:35.949 --> 24:37.015
Hi.

24:37.050 --> 24:38.161
Doin' some Christmas shopping?

24:38.185 --> 24:39.851
Not exactly.

24:39.887 --> 24:41.620
I didn't bring any luggage

24:41.655 --> 24:43.600
so I've gotta find something
to wear for the next few days.

24:43.624 --> 24:45.624
Well, since you are
sticking around,

24:45.692 --> 24:46.925
I was hoping for an interview.

24:46.960 --> 24:48.326
With me?

24:48.362 --> 24:49.961
That's the idea, yeah.

24:49.997 --> 24:53.164
No, I'm really
not that interesting.

24:53.199 --> 24:54.576
The daughter
of the Queen of Crafts?

24:54.600 --> 24:56.278
And with her recent
retirement announcement,

24:56.302 --> 24:58.602
widely considered to be
the heir apparent

24:58.671 --> 25:00.871
of her Fortune 500 company?

25:00.907 --> 25:02.117
Thought you didn't know
who I was.

25:02.141 --> 25:04.275
I did some research.

25:04.310 --> 25:05.776
Reporter.

25:08.714 --> 25:11.048
Well, sounds like you have
everything you need right there.

25:11.083 --> 25:12.443
There's not much more
to the story.

25:12.485 --> 25:14.051
Well, let me be
the judge of that.

25:17.522 --> 25:19.923
Can you excuse us
for one moment?

25:19.958 --> 25:21.391
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

25:24.663 --> 25:27.630
- You should do it.
- Are you serious?

25:27.666 --> 25:29.332
It'll be good press.

25:29.367 --> 25:31.801
I am trying to avoid questions.

25:31.837 --> 25:33.603
Now you want me
to sign up for some?

25:33.638 --> 25:36.506
Look, he is the uncle of the
girl that you're here to help.

25:36.541 --> 25:37.974
I'm not sure that you'll find

25:38.009 --> 25:40.375
a more friendly
interview situation.

25:45.749 --> 25:47.716
What's all this?

25:47.751 --> 25:51.153
- Christmas on Main Street.
- Christmas on Main Street?

25:51.188 --> 25:52.833
Yeah, it's Cedar Falls'
biggest event of the year.

25:52.857 --> 25:54.456
They shut down Main Street

25:54.492 --> 25:56.859
and there's games,
concessions, carolling.

25:56.894 --> 25:59.094
Yeah.

25:59.163 --> 26:02.364
- Check out that tree.
- Yeah.

26:02.399 --> 26:03.443
That's the grand finale.

26:03.467 --> 26:05.266
So at the end of the night,

26:05.301 --> 26:07.502
they'll light that tree
in the centre of the square.

26:07.570 --> 26:09.470
I'm gonna go get
some footage of that.

26:09.539 --> 26:10.539
Okay.

26:13.510 --> 26:15.977
So you graduated
with an MBA in business?

26:16.012 --> 26:17.645
I did.

26:17.680 --> 26:19.313
Always been good with numbers.

26:19.382 --> 26:20.882
Everybody says
I take after my dad.

26:20.917 --> 26:22.550
Well, I mean, if you can cook,

26:22.585 --> 26:25.853
then obviously your mom's
an influence as well.

26:25.889 --> 26:27.355
Right! Yeah,
I mean, of course.

26:27.390 --> 26:30.023
You know, sort of 50/50 I guess.

26:30.092 --> 26:33.927
I used to have
a camera just like that.

26:33.962 --> 26:35.862
My dad got it for me
for my 15th birthday.

26:39.201 --> 26:41.201
What are you doing?

26:41.270 --> 26:42.502
Just jotting it down.

26:42.571 --> 26:44.771
It's not really important.

26:44.806 --> 26:46.907
It sounded important to you.

26:46.942 --> 26:50.544
Yeah. More of a hobby.
I just...

26:50.612 --> 26:51.823
I always like to be
behind the camera

26:51.847 --> 26:53.747
rather than in front of it.

26:53.782 --> 26:55.748
I oversee
our feature photo shoots.

26:55.783 --> 26:56.882
Excuse us.

26:56.918 --> 26:57.918
My gosh!

26:58.953 --> 27:00.052
Here, here.

27:00.087 --> 27:01.387
Sorry, I... That's all right.

27:01.422 --> 27:02.533
I was so sure
I could balance them.

27:02.557 --> 27:03.856
Where did you park?

27:03.925 --> 27:06.458
I had to park way,
way down the street.

27:06.494 --> 27:07.726
Let us walk you to your car.

27:07.762 --> 27:08.727
You don't have to do that.

27:08.763 --> 27:09.763
It's our pleasure.

27:09.797 --> 27:10.896
Really?

27:10.932 --> 27:11.975
Yeah. Lead the way.

27:11.999 --> 27:12.965
Yeah, okay. Thank you.

27:13.000 --> 27:14.667
You're a Christmas angel.

27:19.506 --> 27:21.906
So, thank you again for
answering all my questions.

27:21.942 --> 27:23.341
Yeah, no problem.

27:23.376 --> 27:25.843
Did you get everything
you needed?

27:25.879 --> 27:27.545
For now.

27:27.614 --> 27:29.414
Great.
I'll see you later.

27:29.449 --> 27:30.748
See ya.

27:30.784 --> 27:32.951
Here, can you put those
in there? Thanks.

27:37.023 --> 27:40.158
What's this?

27:41.661 --> 27:45.562
Word does travel fast
in a small town.

27:45.598 --> 27:46.598
Yeah.

27:50.235 --> 27:51.835
Well, I hope you brought
your appetite.

27:52.938 --> 27:53.904
Good morning.

27:53.939 --> 27:55.439
Hi!

27:55.474 --> 27:57.307
Well, it seems my very busy son

27:57.376 --> 27:59.743
suddenly had an opening
for breakfast.

27:59.778 --> 28:01.378
No, he's still on the clock,
Mom.

28:01.413 --> 28:04.014
John's writing a piece
on Candace for the newspaper.

28:04.049 --> 28:05.449
I see.

28:05.484 --> 28:08.218
I'm here.
Isn't that what counts?

28:08.253 --> 28:09.585
Can I get you two some coffee?

28:09.621 --> 28:11.153
Yes, coffee would be wonderful.

28:11.189 --> 28:12.688
Thank you.

28:12.724 --> 28:15.224
Well, dig in, everyone.
Don't be shy.

28:15.293 --> 28:18.427
Thank you.

28:18.463 --> 28:20.296
This all looks so good.

28:20.365 --> 28:23.366
We got all the recipes
out of the magazine.

28:23.401 --> 28:26.335
Everything except the
snowflake pancakes, I'm afraid.

28:26.371 --> 28:27.703
Snowflake pancakes?

28:27.772 --> 28:29.839
Yeah. They're sort of
my mom's specialty.

28:29.907 --> 28:31.374
She makes them every Christmas.

28:31.409 --> 28:32.541
And try as I may,

28:32.577 --> 28:34.409
I just can't seem
to get them right!

28:34.444 --> 28:37.145
Well, you know,
it's all in the wrist.

28:38.649 --> 28:41.282
I'd like to see
the snowflake pancakes.

28:41.318 --> 28:42.717
Harper?
You wanna see one?

28:42.753 --> 28:44.152
You know what?

28:44.221 --> 28:45.665
I probably have a picture
of them on my phone.

28:45.689 --> 28:46.699
- I could show you.
- No...

28:46.723 --> 28:48.056
I...

28:48.091 --> 28:49.891
Sorry, I meant,
could you make one?

28:49.960 --> 28:52.794
- Could you?
- I'd love to see it in action!

28:52.829 --> 28:56.731
But here? Now?

28:56.767 --> 28:58.433
Why not?

28:58.502 --> 29:00.234
Well, we don't have any batter.

29:00.302 --> 29:01.368
I can fix that.

29:03.873 --> 29:05.593
- Okay.
- Let's get some snowflake pancakes.

29:06.609 --> 29:07.708
They're gonna be so good.

29:07.743 --> 29:09.576
Pancake time.

29:14.316 --> 29:15.716
What are you doin'?

29:15.785 --> 29:17.251
I thought I'd get a few pictures

29:17.286 --> 29:19.286
as a companion piece
for the article.

29:19.321 --> 29:21.689
Well you know,
it happens really quickly

29:21.724 --> 29:23.223
so I don't know that a picture

29:23.259 --> 29:25.391
is really the best way
to capture the moment.

29:25.460 --> 29:27.260
You're right.
You know what?

29:27.295 --> 29:30.563
Video would be better and then
we can put it on our website.

29:31.599 --> 29:32.932
Here you go.

29:32.967 --> 29:35.334
The batter should be
the right consistency.

29:35.370 --> 29:37.303
I can't wait to see
how it all turns out!

29:38.640 --> 29:39.972
Me either!

29:41.409 --> 29:44.877
All right.
Get the right position

29:44.913 --> 29:47.847
and start here...

29:47.882 --> 29:49.214
and here we go.

29:49.249 --> 29:50.482
Candace!

29:50.517 --> 29:52.617
Would you mind
if I gave it a shot?

29:52.653 --> 29:54.553
Yeah. Go ahead.

29:54.588 --> 29:56.388
She has been showing me
the perfect technique.

29:57.224 --> 29:58.523
I've been practicing

29:58.559 --> 30:00.525
and I would really love
to try it out.

30:00.561 --> 30:02.227
Yes! I think
that's a great idea.

30:02.296 --> 30:04.296
You should practice.

30:12.239 --> 30:14.371
Very nice.

30:14.440 --> 30:16.207
Okay. Good, yeah.
I'll take that.

30:19.112 --> 30:21.278
Right...

30:21.347 --> 30:24.081
That's perfect.
Just like I taught you.

30:24.150 --> 30:25.683
Perfect.

30:27.120 --> 30:28.120
Take that.

30:35.394 --> 30:37.995
Whoa, it looks
just like the picture!

30:38.030 --> 30:39.929
You must be
an excellent teacher!

30:39.965 --> 30:41.798
Well...

30:41.833 --> 30:45.235
I'd still like to get one
of Candace doing it.

30:45.270 --> 30:46.710
Just... if you don't mind
if I could?

30:46.738 --> 30:48.238
But we need to get a move on

30:48.306 --> 30:49.984
or we'll be late for the
gingerbread competition!

30:50.008 --> 30:52.142
Go on, before it all gets cold!

30:52.177 --> 30:54.077
Yeah.

30:55.614 --> 30:57.547
- Thank you.
- Of course.

31:07.258 --> 31:08.258
This looks fun.

31:08.325 --> 31:09.658
Yeah.

31:09.693 --> 31:11.493
Don't let those
friendly faces fool you.

31:11.529 --> 31:12.961
It gets pretty competitive.

31:12.997 --> 31:15.848
- Seriously?
- Cutthroat.

31:15.883 --> 31:17.382
I see my friends.
Can I go say hi?

31:18.419 --> 31:20.853
So? What can I expect?

31:20.888 --> 31:22.955
To be honest, I'm not sure.

31:22.990 --> 31:24.490
I haven't been here
since I was a kid.

31:24.558 --> 31:25.657
Really?

31:25.726 --> 31:27.926
Just haven't found the time.

31:29.395 --> 31:30.773
Well you know,
my mom always had a saying.

31:30.797 --> 31:32.997
"Time well spent
is time spent together".

31:33.032 --> 31:37.869
Well, your mother
is incredibly successful.

31:37.904 --> 31:39.584
I'm sure she spent
long hours to get there.

31:40.740 --> 31:41.873
Sure.

31:41.908 --> 31:43.268
But family
was always the priority.

31:43.309 --> 31:44.653
And there was nothing
more important.

31:44.677 --> 31:46.577
Especially at Christmas.

31:46.613 --> 31:49.580
It was a time
for us to slow down

31:49.616 --> 31:52.450
and appreciate all that we have
with the people we love.

31:52.519 --> 31:55.485
You know, I think we need
to get you into the spirit.

31:55.521 --> 31:57.621
And how do you propose
to do that?

31:57.656 --> 31:59.789
I've got just the thing.

31:59.825 --> 32:01.258
Yes.

32:05.497 --> 32:07.731
Yeah! It's a start.

32:10.269 --> 32:13.203
Welcome, everyone,

32:13.238 --> 32:15.772
to the 50th annual
gingerbread showdown!

32:18.042 --> 32:20.643
We're so lucky today

32:20.678 --> 32:23.078
to have a very special
guest judge,

32:23.114 --> 32:25.948
Candace Livingstone!

32:27.118 --> 32:29.151
Hi. Hi, everyone!

32:29.186 --> 32:30.252
I'm gonna put this down.

32:30.321 --> 32:34.123
Thank you, Mayor Walsh
and thank you, Cedar Falls

32:34.158 --> 32:36.825
for inviting me to be a part
of such a wonderful event.

32:36.894 --> 32:39.028
I'm sure I have a very tough
decision ahead of me.

32:39.063 --> 32:41.230
Now, before we begin,

32:41.265 --> 32:44.165
we thought it might be fun
to ask Candace

32:44.200 --> 32:47.335
to show us some tips
and tricks of the trade!

32:52.676 --> 32:55.821
You guys don't need my advice.
They're in a competition, right?

32:55.845 --> 32:57.011
Well, what do ya say, folks?

32:57.047 --> 32:58.813
Would you like a little
demonstration?

33:00.784 --> 33:03.017
Why did it have to be
gingerbread?

33:03.053 --> 33:05.219
Candace! Candace! Candace!

33:06.890 --> 33:13.961
Okay. Well, the secret to a perfect
gingerbread house is patience.

33:13.996 --> 33:18.565
Because, you know,
it can take one, or two...

33:18.601 --> 33:20.567
or, you know,

33:20.603 --> 33:24.671
even ten tries

33:24.707 --> 33:26.506
to get it right.
Oh, boy.

33:26.542 --> 33:29.009
Yeah. But you know,

33:29.078 --> 33:31.111
the great thing about
gingerbread houses

33:31.146 --> 33:32.612
is that there
really are no rules.

33:32.680 --> 33:35.348
So, you know,
your gingerbread house

33:35.383 --> 33:37.850
could be tall or short,

33:37.885 --> 33:40.720
neat or messy.

33:42.123 --> 33:44.190
Really,
the perfect gingerbread house

33:44.225 --> 33:47.460
is whatever you make it to be.

33:47.495 --> 33:50.296
And that royal icing is
giving you a bit of trouble?

33:50.331 --> 33:51.897
Just add a splash
of lemon juice.

33:51.933 --> 33:53.866
Wonderful. Thank you, Candace!

33:56.004 --> 33:57.769
Let the competition begin!

33:57.838 --> 34:01.339
- Good luck, everyone!
- Good luck.

34:04.177 --> 34:05.777
Look at all those windows.

34:08.014 --> 34:09.813
Look at this one!

34:11.318 --> 34:12.762
- It looks like a little castle!
- Yeah.

34:12.786 --> 34:14.085
They did a great job.

34:16.223 --> 34:18.223
Look at that!

34:20.860 --> 34:22.525
Nice job.

34:26.666 --> 34:27.731
Great job.

34:30.603 --> 34:31.635
Well, ladies.

34:32.838 --> 34:34.471
Do we have a winner?

34:34.507 --> 34:35.572
What do you think?

34:36.809 --> 34:38.275
Okay.

34:38.310 --> 34:39.920
I have conferred with
my esteemed colleague here

34:39.945 --> 34:41.712
and we have made a decision.

34:44.216 --> 34:46.183
Wonderful!
It's the Carsons!

34:47.652 --> 34:49.052
Again.

34:49.120 --> 34:50.253
Let's get a picture.

34:54.458 --> 34:55.925
Great. Nice job.

34:58.096 --> 35:00.630
Kevin. Grab the photo.

35:04.469 --> 35:06.080
Well, we're all heading home
to trim the tree.

35:06.104 --> 35:08.738
Do you have to get back
to the paper right away?

35:11.242 --> 35:12.307
I'll be right behind you.

35:12.342 --> 35:13.442
- Yes!
- All right.

35:13.477 --> 35:15.277
See you later.

35:20.584 --> 35:21.895
I can't believe
you still have this.

35:21.919 --> 35:23.196
You made this for me
when you were six.

35:23.220 --> 35:25.821
Of course I still have it.

35:25.856 --> 35:27.122
It's lopsided.

35:27.157 --> 35:28.157
It's perfect!

35:28.225 --> 35:29.491
I like it!

35:29.560 --> 35:30.759
There you go.
Two against one.

35:30.794 --> 35:32.060
And she's the expert.

35:32.096 --> 35:33.562
I'm hanging it in the back.

35:34.631 --> 35:35.831
Yep.

35:35.866 --> 35:37.431
What are we going to do
about the angel?

35:37.467 --> 35:38.933
Dad always puts it on top.

35:38.968 --> 35:42.937
Harper. I spoke to your dad
last night and...

35:42.972 --> 35:44.452
- ...he thinks you should do it.
- Me?

35:45.374 --> 35:46.907
Candace,
can you hand me that box?

35:46.976 --> 35:47.976
Yeah, sure.

35:49.645 --> 35:51.278
There you go.
Thank you.

35:51.314 --> 35:53.047
But I can't reach.

35:53.082 --> 35:55.015
I think I can
help you with that.

35:55.051 --> 35:56.117
Ready?

36:01.324 --> 36:03.523
Okay.

36:03.558 --> 36:05.225
Now, you see?

36:05.260 --> 36:06.860
You almost missed this.

36:08.997 --> 36:10.730
You did a good job.

36:10.799 --> 36:12.065
Thanks.

36:16.471 --> 36:18.015
There's something
that just doesn't add up.

36:18.039 --> 36:20.240
Did you see her
at the gingerbread competition?

36:20.275 --> 36:21.886
She didn't even know
what a gingerbread house was

36:21.910 --> 36:22.976
let alone how to make one.

36:23.011 --> 36:24.511
Everyone has an off day.

36:24.546 --> 36:27.446
No, I think... I think
you should look into this.

36:27.481 --> 36:29.548
My instincts are never wrong.

36:29.583 --> 36:31.450
- She was...
- Dig a little deeper.

36:34.255 --> 36:35.888
Come on, Ben.
She was ambushed.

36:35.956 --> 36:38.090
She wasn't expecting
to build a gingerbread house.

36:43.864 --> 36:45.330
For what it's worth,

36:45.366 --> 36:47.533
I thought you handled it
with a lot of finesse.

36:47.568 --> 36:48.834
Really?

36:48.869 --> 36:50.936
Well, the crowd
seemed to like it.

36:50.971 --> 36:52.470
I've been here
less than two days

36:52.505 --> 36:55.239
and I've barely averted
three potential disasters.

36:55.275 --> 36:56.674
But they were averted.

36:56.709 --> 36:57.853
And if anything else comes up,

36:57.877 --> 36:59.410
I will run interference.

36:59.445 --> 37:01.379
Wait, wait, wait.
We've got one more problem.

37:01.414 --> 37:03.614
- What?
- John.

37:03.650 --> 37:05.817
Because you wanna
lose yourself in his eyes

37:05.852 --> 37:07.218
and never find your way out?

37:08.588 --> 37:10.054
I was thinking
because he's nosy.

37:10.089 --> 37:11.823
Right.

37:11.858 --> 37:13.891
Look.

37:13.960 --> 37:16.126
The last thing I need is a
reporter tailing me around,

37:16.161 --> 37:18.595
catching me
in a domestic mishap.

37:18.630 --> 37:19.896
Don't worry...

37:19.932 --> 37:21.198
Heavens, you're just in time!

37:21.233 --> 37:22.499
I have a surprise for you.

37:22.534 --> 37:24.401
No, no.

37:24.469 --> 37:26.036
I'm not really big on surprises.

37:26.071 --> 37:28.672
I know you'll love this one.

37:28.740 --> 37:30.240
Come.

37:42.320 --> 37:43.819
Welcome.

37:43.888 --> 37:47.489
The inn hosts a sewing circle
twice a month

37:47.525 --> 37:49.859
but since you're here in town,

37:49.894 --> 37:52.027
I decided to call
an emergency meeting.

37:52.096 --> 37:54.063
Let me, take your coats.

37:54.098 --> 37:56.232
I thought it would be
a welcome sight

37:56.267 --> 37:57.700
to help you feel at home.

37:57.735 --> 37:59.668
Oh, gosh, well you...

37:59.704 --> 38:01.237
didn't have to go
to all this trouble.

38:01.305 --> 38:02.771
No trouble at all!

38:02.807 --> 38:05.307
Well, I remembered
last year's Christmas issue

38:05.343 --> 38:06.875
was all about how
you and your mother

38:06.910 --> 38:09.277
loved to knit something
special for the holidays.

38:09.346 --> 38:11.212
Yes. Yeah...

38:11.248 --> 38:12.547
You know, Mrs. Deevers,

38:12.582 --> 38:13.960
can I just talk to you
for a second?

38:13.984 --> 38:15.483
Sure. Just one second.

38:17.087 --> 38:19.087
You know, I... I...
would really rather just watch.

38:19.122 --> 38:20.766
You know, I don't wanna
disrupt the circle.

38:20.790 --> 38:22.490
No, no!

38:22.525 --> 38:25.393
They'll be excited to learn
some tricks from an expert.

38:25.462 --> 38:28.162
Well, I...
I wouldn't say expert.

38:28.198 --> 38:31.131
All right.
I see what's going on here.

38:31.166 --> 38:33.400
You... you do?

38:33.435 --> 38:35.102
I think it's fairly obvious.

38:36.805 --> 38:38.171
It is.

38:38.207 --> 38:41.341
You're worried
about showing the others up.

38:41.410 --> 38:43.243
You caught her!

38:43.279 --> 38:46.113
That is Candace,
modest to a fault.

38:46.181 --> 38:48.815
You have nothing to worry about.

38:48.851 --> 38:51.051
We all just do this for fun!

38:51.120 --> 38:52.519
Come!

38:52.588 --> 38:55.655
Yes, okay. Sorry, excuse me.

38:55.723 --> 38:57.089
Sorry.
Thank you so much.

38:57.125 --> 38:58.125
Right here in the middle.

38:58.159 --> 39:00.359
Okay, great. Hi.

39:00.395 --> 39:01.395
Now that that's settled,

39:01.462 --> 39:03.696
I have just one question:

39:03.765 --> 39:06.098
knitting or cross-stitch?

39:06.134 --> 39:07.233
Knitting.

39:07.268 --> 39:09.135
Yeah, Candace,

39:09.203 --> 39:11.015
you have that scarf
that you've been working on.

39:11.039 --> 39:12.705
Scarf.

39:12.740 --> 39:14.140
Yeah, maybe you could
finish it up?

39:14.175 --> 39:16.909
Yeah, yeah.

39:16.945 --> 39:18.411
I'll go grab it for you.

39:18.446 --> 39:19.946
Perfect.

39:22.249 --> 39:23.982
Thank you.

39:24.017 --> 39:26.117
Isn't this fun?

39:26.153 --> 39:27.852
It's so much!

39:27.921 --> 39:30.722
Yeah. Hi, ladies.
Thank you for having me.

39:35.062 --> 39:36.528
Yes.

39:43.437 --> 39:45.602
I got it!

39:45.671 --> 39:48.339
Yeah, there...
there's the scarf.

39:48.374 --> 39:49.707
My, that's beautiful.

39:49.775 --> 39:51.508
Yeah!

39:53.446 --> 40:00.718
- So, what do I do with this now?
- Stick some buttons on it?

40:00.753 --> 40:03.654
Could you hand me
those buttons right there?

40:10.695 --> 40:13.262
Some of these...

40:13.298 --> 40:16.332
Doing lovely work, ladies.
Some more buttons.

40:28.113 --> 40:30.747
That's a really beautiful quilt.

40:30.815 --> 40:32.482
Thank you.

40:32.517 --> 40:35.617
You know, next month's issue
is gonna be all about quilts.

40:35.652 --> 40:36.718
You would love it.

40:36.754 --> 40:39.221
- Do you have a subscription?
- I'm sorry, I don't.

40:39.256 --> 40:41.990
That's okay.
I could send you one.

40:42.026 --> 40:45.494
Truth is, I find your magazine
a little intimidating.

40:45.529 --> 40:47.129
Intimidating?

40:47.164 --> 40:49.731
I shouldn't have said anything.

40:49.767 --> 40:51.867
No, I... I'd love
to hear your thoughts.

40:51.902 --> 40:53.969
Well, it's just...
all the perfect pictures

40:54.004 --> 40:55.070
of all the perfect things?

40:55.139 --> 41:00.441
It always felt so unattainable,
like it wasn't meant for me.

41:00.476 --> 41:03.177
I'm sure you have no idea
what I'm talking about.

41:03.212 --> 41:08.783
No. No, I do.
More than you realize.

41:10.753 --> 41:12.153
Just for the record,

41:12.221 --> 41:13.699
we would be lucky
to feature a quilt like that

41:13.723 --> 41:14.789
in our magazine.

41:21.497 --> 41:22.997
Good night, ladies.

41:23.066 --> 41:24.131
Bye.
Good night.

41:24.167 --> 41:26.466
- So lovely meeting you.
- Bye. Nice to meet you.

41:26.535 --> 41:27.712
Thank you so much.
Have a good night.

41:27.736 --> 41:30.003
- Good to see you.
- Hi! How are you?

41:30.038 --> 41:31.971
Hi.

41:32.845 --> 41:34.684
- Hey.
- Hey.

41:35.143 --> 41:36.376
What are you doin' here?

41:36.411 --> 41:39.379
Just...

41:39.414 --> 41:41.681
observing you
in your natural habitat.

41:41.716 --> 41:44.517
You know, getting a little
colour for the story.

41:45.754 --> 41:46.931
I thought it was
just an interview.

41:46.955 --> 41:49.621
- Now I'm a story.
- Right, yeah.

41:49.690 --> 41:53.992
But it's kind of a big deal,
you coming to town.

41:54.028 --> 41:56.528
So my editor thought it would
be nice to get a profile piece.

41:56.597 --> 41:59.731
I was hoping to maybe spend
the day together tomorrow?

41:59.767 --> 42:02.301
My family's going downtown
for the festival.

42:02.369 --> 42:05.070
We'd love for you to come.

42:05.106 --> 42:07.973
- John! Hi!
- Hi, how are you?

42:08.008 --> 42:09.842
- What a surprise!
- Yeah.

42:09.910 --> 42:13.879
Did you see the beautiful
scarf that Candace made?

42:17.250 --> 42:18.250
You made this?

42:19.352 --> 42:22.687
- Isn't she talented?
- Yeah, very.

42:22.755 --> 42:24.088
Yes, indeed. Well,

42:24.124 --> 42:27.358
I guess I'll just leave
you two kids alone.

42:27.393 --> 42:29.227
Yeah.

42:29.262 --> 42:30.695
Good night.

42:34.167 --> 42:36.467
Well, if you don't have
any questions for tonight,

42:36.536 --> 42:38.236
- I think I'm gonna go...
- Yeah.

42:38.271 --> 42:39.714
No, it looks like
I missed out on all the fun.

42:39.738 --> 42:42.305
So...

42:42.341 --> 42:44.341
See you tomorrow?

42:44.376 --> 42:45.976
- Yeah.
- Great.

42:46.011 --> 42:47.878
- Good night.
- Good night.

43:11.402 --> 43:12.535
- Hey!
- Hey.

43:12.570 --> 43:15.104
- What's up?
- I just spoke to Matt.

43:15.173 --> 43:17.006
His parents want us
to celebrate Christmas

43:17.041 --> 43:19.842
with them at their family cabin.

43:19.877 --> 43:21.477
It was a last minute decision.

43:21.512 --> 43:23.612
When do you have to leave?

43:24.615 --> 43:25.681
Tomorrow.

43:30.353 --> 43:31.886
Okay.

43:33.690 --> 43:36.558
I'll keep my phone on
in case of an emergency.

43:36.593 --> 43:37.593
You think I can do this?

43:37.627 --> 43:38.860
You made it this far.

43:38.895 --> 43:40.261
Yeah, with your help.

43:40.330 --> 43:42.230
You only agreed to the one day.

43:42.299 --> 43:44.265
No one would blame you
if you left early.

43:45.669 --> 43:46.669
Merry Christmas.

43:46.736 --> 43:48.469
Okay.

43:48.538 --> 43:50.071
- Have fun.
- Yeah.

43:59.615 --> 44:01.782
<i>Hello. You've
reached Liz Livingstone.</i>

44:01.850 --> 44:03.684
<i>I can't come to the phone
right now.</i>

44:03.719 --> 44:06.000
<i>Leave a message after the tone
and have a Merry Christmas.</i>

44:07.456 --> 44:09.256
Hey, Mom, it's me.

44:09.291 --> 44:12.092
Looks like I'll be joining
you in Aspen, after all.

44:12.127 --> 44:14.061
Give me a call
when you get this.

44:14.096 --> 44:16.930
Okay, bye.

44:22.837 --> 44:24.103
Candace!

44:24.138 --> 44:25.972
What a wonderful surprise!

44:26.040 --> 44:28.040
Hi. Is Harper here?

44:28.076 --> 44:29.742
She's inside, come on in!

44:29.811 --> 44:31.110
Okay, I'll be right there.

44:31.145 --> 44:32.912
Great.

44:35.950 --> 44:38.451
I can't believe you're going to
miss Christmas on Main Street!

44:38.519 --> 44:40.497
<i>Well, you're just gonna have
to tell me all about it</i>

44:40.521 --> 44:42.132
<i>when I'm back!
Did you pick an ornament?</i>

44:42.156 --> 44:43.622
Still deciding.

44:43.657 --> 44:45.824
I voted was for the snowman
with the sunglasses.

44:45.859 --> 44:47.993
<i>Ha! That's why Harper
is in charge.</i>

44:48.061 --> 44:49.527
<i>You know, I gotta go, kiddo.</i>

44:49.563 --> 44:50.929
Already?

44:50.998 --> 44:52.564
<i>I know,
I'm sorry it was so short.</i>

44:52.599 --> 44:54.566
<i>But listen,
I'm gonna be home so soon,</i>

44:54.635 --> 44:56.334
<i>and I can't wait to see you!</i>

44:56.370 --> 44:57.602
Okay. Bye, Dad. Love you.

44:57.638 --> 44:59.304
<i>I love you, too, kiddo.</i>

44:59.339 --> 45:01.039
<i>I'll see you soon, Janey.</i>

45:01.074 --> 45:02.540
Not soon enough.

45:02.576 --> 45:03.775
<i>Bye, Mom.</i>

45:03.844 --> 45:05.010
Love you, son.

45:05.045 --> 45:06.244
See you, bro.

45:06.313 --> 45:08.380
<i>See ya, buddy.
Love you guys!</i>

45:08.447 --> 45:10.948
<i>See you soon!</i>

45:12.618 --> 45:13.884
Hey...

45:13.919 --> 45:15.519
Do you think he suspects
anything?

45:17.690 --> 45:19.623
You're about to throw him
the world's best

45:19.659 --> 45:21.692
Christmas homecoming,
and he doesn't have a clue!

45:21.761 --> 45:24.128
Do you think he's going
to like it?

45:24.163 --> 45:26.130
No. I think he's going
to love it.

45:27.433 --> 45:29.900
Thanks, Uncle John.

45:31.370 --> 45:33.237
Hi, Candace!

45:33.272 --> 45:35.338
What brings you here?

45:35.407 --> 45:37.607
Well, I wanted to talk
to Harper about something.

45:37.642 --> 45:39.609
What is it?

45:43.281 --> 45:46.749
Well, I heard there was a big
Christmas festival in town,

45:46.785 --> 45:49.852
and I was wondering if I might
tag along for the day?

45:51.089 --> 45:52.422
Yeah!

45:56.928 --> 45:58.994
Great.

46:14.078 --> 46:15.678
Hey, what are you doing here,
little guy?

46:17.314 --> 46:19.448
That looks great!
Good job!

46:27.890 --> 46:30.024
There you are!

46:30.059 --> 46:33.194
- Hey, how are you?
- So good to see you!

46:33.262 --> 46:35.062
- Good to see you.
- Merry Christmas!

46:35.098 --> 46:36.731
Merry almost Christmas.

46:36.766 --> 46:37.965
How does it look?

46:38.034 --> 46:40.234
I think it looks great.

46:43.873 --> 46:46.140
I'd say you picked the best
branch in the bunch.

46:46.175 --> 46:47.441
Where'd you sneak off to?

46:47.477 --> 46:49.342
Well...

46:49.378 --> 46:52.812
This was still in the window.

46:52.848 --> 46:55.882
So, everyone just brings an
ornament from their own tree?

46:55.951 --> 46:58.184
It's a tradition
almost as old as the town.

46:58.220 --> 47:01.755
A way to celebrate Christmas
together, as a community.

47:01.790 --> 47:04.224
I love that.

47:04.259 --> 47:06.459
Harper! Do you want
some Christmas fudge?

47:08.630 --> 47:11.231
As if the answer
was ever going to be no.

47:11.266 --> 47:12.732
Come on.

47:12.767 --> 47:15.367
Ooh, that one!

47:15.403 --> 47:17.503
I'm gonna get a picture of this.

47:17.538 --> 47:19.037
Is that for the magazine?

47:19.106 --> 47:23.742
Nope.
Just for me.

47:30.184 --> 47:32.684
Thank you.

47:36.123 --> 47:39.824
- Here.
- Thanks.

47:39.859 --> 47:41.125
Cherry blossoms.

47:42.395 --> 47:44.095
It's on old Austrian tradition.

47:44.130 --> 47:46.242
You take a cherry blossom branch
and you put it in a vase,

47:46.266 --> 47:48.800
and if it blooms by Christmas,
you'll have good luck in love.

47:48.868 --> 47:52.069
Really?

47:52.138 --> 47:53.805
I was going to do a story

47:53.840 --> 47:56.240
about Christmas traditions
in other countries,

47:56.276 --> 47:58.876
but my boss shot it down.

47:58.912 --> 48:01.112
Said focus on local news.

48:02.415 --> 48:04.414
I see...

48:05.651 --> 48:07.117
What?

48:07.152 --> 48:10.086
Nothing, just...

48:10.122 --> 48:11.955
You know, sometimes
we get so focused

48:12.024 --> 48:14.424
on wanting the things
that we don't have

48:14.493 --> 48:17.294
that we forget about the things
we already do have.

48:17.329 --> 48:20.263
I just want to feel like
I'm making a difference.

48:20.299 --> 48:22.065
Aren't you?

48:22.100 --> 48:25.902
I mean, these people trust you
enough to tell their stories.

48:25.938 --> 48:28.671
I'd say that's pretty important.

48:28.706 --> 48:31.173
You know, it's just growing up,

48:31.209 --> 48:33.142
I was always in Steve's shadow.

48:33.177 --> 48:35.444
It doesn't feel like much
has changed.

48:35.480 --> 48:38.681
You know, I guess I'm always
just looking for a way

48:38.716 --> 48:42.384
to make my own mark.

48:43.654 --> 48:47.056
Well, believe me.
I can relate to that.

48:47.091 --> 48:49.558
Yeah, well,
I guess you can, huh?

48:53.497 --> 48:56.965
- You're nothing like I expected.
- What's that mean?

48:57.000 --> 48:59.701
Well, I didn't think we'd
have anything in common.

48:59.736 --> 49:01.202
And you're easy to talk to.

49:02.939 --> 49:04.672
And shorter in real life.

49:04.708 --> 49:06.708
I'm not short.

49:06.776 --> 49:07.942
Short-er.

49:07.978 --> 49:09.477
Yeah.

49:13.583 --> 49:15.884
This hot chocolate is delicious.

49:15.919 --> 49:17.217
You know what?

49:17.286 --> 49:19.920
If you think this is delicious,
I got something to show you.

49:19.955 --> 49:22.623
Come on.

49:32.001 --> 49:34.401
Everything looks so good.

49:34.436 --> 49:36.014
Yeah, this is Steve's favourite
part of the festival.

49:36.038 --> 49:37.538
My big brother has
a real sweet tooth.

49:37.573 --> 49:39.840
You know, we should see
if some of the vendors

49:39.875 --> 49:41.542
would make some things
for his homecoming.

49:41.610 --> 49:44.143
That's a great idea.

49:44.178 --> 49:45.511
Hearts?

49:45.580 --> 49:47.113
It's a family tradition.

49:47.148 --> 49:48.893
My grandmother made sugar
cookies every Christmas,

49:48.917 --> 49:50.516
and one year, all she could find

49:50.552 --> 49:51.862
was her Valentine's Day
cookie cutters.

49:51.886 --> 49:54.153
It became a thing we always did.

49:54.188 --> 49:57.657
It's a little unconventional,
but it's ours.

49:57.725 --> 49:59.136
Well, I think it's a lovely
tradition.

49:59.160 --> 50:01.561
Thanks.

50:01.596 --> 50:03.996
We'll take two.

50:05.233 --> 50:06.798
Why, thank you.

50:09.002 --> 50:10.602
That was wonderful.

50:10.637 --> 50:12.571
That was so amazing!

50:12.606 --> 50:14.083
Oh, my gosh, I haven't eaten
that much sugar

50:14.107 --> 50:15.307
in a very long time!

50:16.843 --> 50:18.310
You okay?

50:18.345 --> 50:19.889
Thank you so much
for letting me tag along.

50:19.913 --> 50:21.112
Of course!

50:21.148 --> 50:22.314
You're always welcome.

50:23.951 --> 50:26.151
And I will be back tomorrow
because Miss Harper,

50:26.186 --> 50:27.652
you and I have a party to plan.

50:27.688 --> 50:30.288
- Yes!
- Nice.

50:30.324 --> 50:31.623
All right, see you guys later.

50:31.657 --> 50:34.091
- See you later.
- Bye!

50:34.126 --> 50:36.126
I'll see you later.

50:36.195 --> 50:39.597
Hey, just one second.

50:39.632 --> 50:42.099
Yeah?

50:42.134 --> 50:43.467
Do you have plans tonight?

50:43.502 --> 50:45.569
I don't have any luggage,

50:45.605 --> 50:47.905
so I certainly don't have
any plans.

50:47.940 --> 50:51.408
Would you like some?

50:51.477 --> 50:53.277
Are you asking me out?

50:53.312 --> 50:55.980
I am.

50:57.315 --> 50:59.449
But, like, but not
on a date-date,

50:59.484 --> 51:01.918
'cause you're probably
seeing someone,

51:01.953 --> 51:05.555
but like, you know,
for the article's sake.

51:06.858 --> 51:09.592
Okay, for the article's sake.

51:09.628 --> 51:11.694
Yeah, right? I mean...

51:11.730 --> 51:15.398
Yeah, and for the record,
I'm not seeing anyone.

51:15.467 --> 51:17.233
That's great.

51:17.302 --> 51:19.002
I mean, or not.

51:19.037 --> 51:21.937
Whatever, you know, for you.

51:21.972 --> 51:23.305
No, I get it.

51:23.374 --> 51:25.741
Dating has always been
a little weird for me.

51:25.776 --> 51:28.710
I'm never quite sure if people
are interested in me,

51:28.746 --> 51:31.813
or Candace Livingstone.

51:31.849 --> 51:34.750
Right.

51:34.785 --> 51:37.285
But you are Candace Livingstone.

51:37.354 --> 51:38.553
Yes, I am. Yes.

51:38.589 --> 51:40.022
Okay, I was just checking.

51:40.057 --> 51:43.458
No, I am, but I'm not.

51:43.494 --> 51:45.060
If that makes any sense.

51:45.095 --> 51:47.128
It does, actually, yeah.

51:47.196 --> 51:49.597
Yeah, so...

51:49.666 --> 51:52.299
I'll pick you up at eight.

51:52.335 --> 51:55.469
Okay. Where are we going?

51:55.505 --> 51:57.872
It's a surprise.

51:57.907 --> 52:00.374
Okay.

52:00.410 --> 52:01.909
I'll see you tonight.

52:01.944 --> 52:03.644
See you tonight.

52:20.462 --> 52:21.661
Hey.

52:21.730 --> 52:23.897
Finally!
I've been calling all day.

52:23.932 --> 52:25.265
<i>I know, I'm sorry,</i>

52:25.333 --> 52:26.678
I've been down at the Christmas
on Main Street.

52:26.702 --> 52:29.135
I know.
I've been tracking it online.

52:29.171 --> 52:30.648
Anna, would you go enjoy
your vacation?

52:30.672 --> 52:31.883
We're getting really good
feedback.

52:31.907 --> 52:33.273
People are posting pictures.

52:33.308 --> 52:34.752
I've been sharing them
on the website.

52:34.776 --> 52:36.608
<i>Everybody loves you!</i>

52:36.677 --> 52:38.555
There is no way that the board
could turn you down now.

52:38.579 --> 52:40.779
You know what, Anna?
Can I call you back?

52:40.815 --> 52:42.359
I need to go to that little
clothing shop again

52:42.383 --> 52:43.782
<i>before it closes.</i>

52:43.818 --> 52:45.918
What? We were just there.

52:45.953 --> 52:47.497
<i>How many wardrobe changes
have you gone through today?</i>

52:47.521 --> 52:49.555
I actually need an outfit
for tonight.

52:49.590 --> 52:50.889
I'm going out.

52:50.925 --> 52:52.491
With John.

52:52.526 --> 52:54.927
Really?

52:54.962 --> 52:57.162
Would you go decorate
a tree or something?

52:57.231 --> 52:58.931
Or wassail, I don't know.

52:58.966 --> 53:02.967
<i>Fine. But for the record?</i>

53:03.002 --> 53:04.702
One of the worst ways to keep
a low profile

53:04.738 --> 53:06.771
is by falling for the local
reporter.

53:06.806 --> 53:08.139
Goodbye, Anna.

53:08.174 --> 53:10.641
No...

53:24.357 --> 53:26.223
You look beautiful.

53:26.258 --> 53:28.325
This old thing?

53:28.360 --> 53:30.293
I thought you didn't have
any luggage?

53:30.329 --> 53:34.898
So, maybe this old thing
is a rather new thing.

53:36.301 --> 53:40.036
- Shall we?
- We shall.

53:42.508 --> 53:44.808
So, are you excited?

53:44.843 --> 53:47.110
About taking over for your
mother when she retires?

53:47.146 --> 53:49.513
I thought the interview
was over?

53:49.548 --> 53:51.881
This is off the record.

53:51.916 --> 53:54.283
Well, in that case...

53:54.318 --> 53:56.919
I'm really nervous.

53:56.954 --> 53:59.455
Really?

53:59.524 --> 54:01.190
Yeah.

54:01.225 --> 54:03.070
I mean, I always thought I'd be
involved in the family business.

54:03.094 --> 54:05.161
I just figured it would be
behind the scenes.

54:06.697 --> 54:08.442
Well, if it's something
you don't want to do,

54:08.466 --> 54:11.567
then why are you doing it?

54:11.602 --> 54:15.804
It's important to my mom.

54:15.839 --> 54:18.973
Yeah, but what's important
to you?

54:20.610 --> 54:24.445
I guess I haven't figured
that out just yet.

54:24.514 --> 54:26.714
When I was a freshman
in high school,

54:26.750 --> 54:29.984
I counted down the days
until football try-outs.

54:30.020 --> 54:31.686
My brother Steve was
a quarterback,

54:31.755 --> 54:34.956
and there was nothing more I
wanted than to make the team.

54:35.025 --> 54:38.593
Sprained my ankle
the first practice.

54:38.662 --> 54:40.360
Sulked about it for a good week,

54:40.396 --> 54:42.629
and then, my guidance
counselor suggested

54:42.665 --> 54:46.800
I take an extra-curricular
to get my mind off of it.

54:46.869 --> 54:50.170
School newspaper?

54:50.206 --> 54:53.640
The worst thing that happened to
me turned out to be the best.

54:53.676 --> 54:56.977
Well, I like to think that
what we're truly meant to do

54:57.046 --> 55:00.747
finds us eventually.

55:00.783 --> 55:02.850
Why did you come here?

55:02.885 --> 55:05.384
What do you mean?

55:05.453 --> 55:07.019
I don't know many people

55:07.088 --> 55:08.566
who would put their holiday
plans on hold

55:08.590 --> 55:10.556
for a family they haven't met.

55:10.592 --> 55:13.392
Well, to be honest,
I almost didn't come.

55:13.428 --> 55:15.161
I thought Harper
would be disappointed.

55:15.196 --> 55:18.097
Disappointed? Why?

55:18.132 --> 55:20.600
Well, she asked for my mom.

55:20.635 --> 55:23.603
I didn't know how
she'd react when I showed up.

55:23.638 --> 55:26.005
I think she was glad it was you.

55:28.710 --> 55:30.842
I'm glad it was you.

55:36.016 --> 55:37.849
Where are they all
rushing off to?

55:37.885 --> 55:39.351
You know what,
we gotta go. Yep.

55:39.386 --> 55:40.852
What's going on?

55:40.888 --> 55:42.454
- We're gonna miss it.
- Okay!

55:42.489 --> 55:44.956
Yep, come on.

55:46.393 --> 55:47.592
Excuse me.

55:47.628 --> 55:49.027
No, that way.

55:50.430 --> 55:51.875
Are you gonna tell me
what's going on?

55:51.899 --> 55:53.265
No, I'm going to show you.

55:53.300 --> 55:55.432
Three, two, one!

55:55.468 --> 55:57.601
Merry Christmas!

56:02.909 --> 56:04.708
Can't come to Christmas
on Main Street

56:04.777 --> 56:06.477
and miss the best part.

56:06.512 --> 56:09.980
Well, it looks like somebody
found their Christmas spirit.

56:10.049 --> 56:12.549
You were right.

56:12.585 --> 56:15.619
I was too busy
chasing the next story,

56:15.655 --> 56:19.089
and I forgot about all the
things that were important.

56:19.125 --> 56:22.926
These traditions used to mean
something to me.

56:22.961 --> 56:25.428
I guess they still do.

56:26.898 --> 56:30.767
Well, it is pretty spectacular.

56:30.802 --> 56:33.236
It is.

56:34.973 --> 56:38.041
Candace, it is you!

56:38.076 --> 56:42.912
I'm sorry.
Am I interrupting something?

56:42.948 --> 56:44.414
No, no, no!

56:44.449 --> 56:46.315
Yeah, we were just enjoying
the tree-lighting.

56:46.383 --> 56:48.350
Wonderful!

56:48.385 --> 56:50.552
It really is something, Mayor.

56:50.587 --> 56:51.887
Yes, it is!

56:51.956 --> 56:54.022
The events committee
does a fine job.

56:54.091 --> 56:55.324
Yeah.

56:55.359 --> 56:56.959
I was hoping to convince you

56:56.994 --> 56:59.227
to come up and pose
for some pictures.

56:59.263 --> 57:02.731
There are a lot of people that
are very excited to meet you!

57:04.668 --> 57:07.069
Yeah, I'll be fine.

57:07.104 --> 57:08.403
Okay.

57:08.439 --> 57:09.770
You should go.

57:09.806 --> 57:11.372
Yes, of course, I would love to.

57:11.407 --> 57:12.940
Wonderful.

57:13.009 --> 57:14.508
I'll bring her right back.

57:14.544 --> 57:15.710
Thank you.

57:19.182 --> 57:20.381
Me first!

57:20.416 --> 57:22.717
Yes, absolutely.

57:32.962 --> 57:35.428
I had a really good time
tonight.

57:35.464 --> 57:37.931
Yeah, me too.

57:40.469 --> 57:42.969
Good night, John.

57:43.005 --> 57:45.472
Good night, Candace.

57:50.879 --> 57:52.112
Good night, John!

57:54.750 --> 57:57.283
Good night, Mrs. Deevers!

57:57.319 --> 57:59.785
Bye.

58:13.701 --> 58:14.900
Hi.

58:14.935 --> 58:16.101
Ms. Livingstone!

58:16.170 --> 58:17.536
Yes?

58:17.571 --> 58:20.205
I have something for you.

58:20.274 --> 58:22.674
I'm sorry,
it didn't come with a note.

58:22.743 --> 58:24.375
That's okay.

58:24.411 --> 58:26.577
I think I know who sent me this.

58:26.613 --> 58:28.257
Would you mind putting it
up in my room for me?

58:28.281 --> 58:29.480
I'm heading out.

58:29.516 --> 58:30.715
Absolutely!

58:30.750 --> 58:32.850
Thanks.

58:32.886 --> 58:34.252
I saw the notes in your desk.

58:34.287 --> 58:35.453
It's great stuff.

58:35.488 --> 58:37.121
I mean, she faked knitting
a scarf?

58:37.157 --> 58:38.756
No, it was a hunch.

58:38.792 --> 58:40.658
I mean, I don't have any proof.

58:40.693 --> 58:42.226
It's a whole lot of nothing.

58:42.295 --> 58:43.795
The Queen of Crafts' daughter

58:43.830 --> 58:45.196
doesn't know anything
about crafts

58:45.265 --> 58:46.625
and you don't think
that's a story?

58:48.168 --> 58:50.634
I want something on my desk
by tomorrow.

59:00.112 --> 59:01.645
Candace could hide outside.

59:01.713 --> 59:03.680
So, when Dad walks in,
he won't suspect a thing!

59:03.715 --> 59:05.382
Outside? In the snow?

59:05.417 --> 59:07.317
I didn't think of that.

59:07.352 --> 59:08.830
All right,
time to roll out the dough.

59:08.854 --> 59:10.020
Can I do it?

59:10.089 --> 59:12.122
Yes. Of course!

59:12.157 --> 59:14.390
Let's see. Yeah.

59:14.425 --> 59:15.724
Good.

59:17.095 --> 59:20.029
We weren't looking
at the camera.

59:20.064 --> 59:22.331
I know. That's my favourite
kind of picture.

59:22.366 --> 59:23.666
Why?

59:23.734 --> 59:26.302
Because, because I get
something real.

59:26.370 --> 59:28.037
Okay, bye-bye.

59:28.072 --> 59:29.505
That was Betty Ryerson.

59:29.540 --> 59:30.973
She wanted to know

59:31.008 --> 59:32.453
if she could help
with Steve's homecoming.

59:32.477 --> 59:35.611
Nearly half the town's
called to get involved.

59:35.646 --> 59:38.080
If more people want
to come and celebrate,

59:38.116 --> 59:40.548
why don't we make it
a big party.

59:40.584 --> 59:42.016
Yeah!

59:42.052 --> 59:44.119
I don't know. How big?

59:44.154 --> 59:47.455
We could cook a whole Christmas
meal, just like that!

59:47.491 --> 59:49.424
All right! Let's do it!

59:50.927 --> 59:53.394
Can you, Candace?

59:53.430 --> 59:55.497
Me?

59:55.532 --> 59:57.499
Cook a whole Christmas dinner?

59:57.534 --> 59:59.067
Well, we'd help, of course.

59:59.102 --> 01:00:01.636
Naturally, we are not up to
your level of expertise.

01:00:01.705 --> 01:00:05.672
A Christmas dinner
for the whole town!

01:00:05.708 --> 01:00:08.642
Yeah, the whole town.

01:00:08.677 --> 01:00:10.344
Here.

01:00:10.412 --> 01:00:14.014
Probably mostly just watching
a true professional at work.

01:00:15.251 --> 01:00:17.918
Just... just watching.

01:00:17.987 --> 01:00:20.354
Please, Candace,
it would be so cool!

01:00:23.159 --> 01:00:25.092
Well, sure.

01:00:25.127 --> 01:00:27.761
You know, I'd be happy to.

01:00:27.830 --> 01:00:29.529
That's wonderful!

01:00:29.564 --> 01:00:31.397
So exciting.
That's great!

01:00:31.466 --> 01:00:34.400
Mrs. Deevers, just the person
I was looking for.

01:00:34.435 --> 01:00:36.068
How can I help you?

01:00:36.104 --> 01:00:38.204
Well, I'm going to be cooking
a homecoming dinner.

01:00:38.239 --> 01:00:39.739
I heard!

01:00:39.774 --> 01:00:41.407
You heard? Already?

01:00:41.476 --> 01:00:42.875
Word travels fast.

01:00:42.911 --> 01:00:45.678
In a small town, right.

01:00:45.747 --> 01:00:48.114
With you at the helm, we are
certainly in for a treat!

01:00:48.149 --> 01:00:50.516
Right, well,

01:00:50.552 --> 01:00:52.630
that was actually what I wanted
to talk to you about.

01:00:52.654 --> 01:00:54.886
Do you think that I could
use your kitchen tonight?

01:00:54.955 --> 01:00:56.922
My kitchen?

01:00:56.957 --> 01:00:59.558
Yeah, I wanted to test out
some new recipes.

01:00:59.593 --> 01:01:03.328
Oh, well, of course!

01:01:03.363 --> 01:01:04.930
Great.

01:01:04.998 --> 01:01:06.498
Okay, thank you.

01:01:10.971 --> 01:01:13.438
My kitchen!

01:01:38.431 --> 01:01:39.830
Is it true?

01:01:41.100 --> 01:01:43.533
Is it a perfect cake?

01:01:43.602 --> 01:01:45.034
Well, you know,

01:01:45.103 --> 01:01:46.836
it has everything you need
right in the box,

01:01:46.905 --> 01:01:48.382
so it sort of takes
the guesswork out.

01:01:48.406 --> 01:01:50.206
Are you following me?

01:01:50.242 --> 01:01:52.475
No...

01:01:52.510 --> 01:01:54.010
No.

01:01:54.045 --> 01:01:56.145
I just had to grab...

01:01:56.181 --> 01:01:57.747
- Lettuce?
- Right.

01:01:57.782 --> 01:02:00.250
- Got it.
- Yeah.

01:02:02.287 --> 01:02:04.988
I heard you were making
Christmas dinner for us.

01:02:05.023 --> 01:02:08.490
I wanted to make sure
that you were okay with that.

01:02:08.525 --> 01:02:10.459
Yeah, why wouldn't I be?

01:02:10.494 --> 01:02:12.794
'Cause you're our guest,

01:02:12.863 --> 01:02:15.931
and I don't want you to feel
like you have to do anything

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:18.066
that you don't want to do.

01:02:18.135 --> 01:02:20.102
No, no, I do.
I really do.

01:02:20.137 --> 01:02:21.737
So, it's good?

01:02:21.772 --> 01:02:23.905
Yeah, no, absolutely.

01:02:23.941 --> 01:02:25.941
In fact, I'm so inspired

01:02:26.010 --> 01:02:27.988
I thought I would try out
some new recipes tonight.

01:02:28.012 --> 01:02:31.280
Okay, I mean,
I would love to help.

01:02:31.315 --> 01:02:33.347
I mean, I'm all thumbs
in the kitchen,

01:02:33.416 --> 01:02:35.449
but I'm a great taste-tester.

01:02:35.485 --> 01:02:37.451
I...

01:02:37.520 --> 01:02:39.086
I really appreciate that,

01:02:39.122 --> 01:02:41.555
but I think I'm gonna
fly solo on this one.

01:02:41.591 --> 01:02:43.524
Yeah, no, I understand.

01:02:43.559 --> 01:02:45.159
Yeah, no, just do the...

01:02:45.194 --> 01:02:46.927
- Okay.
- You know, whatever.

01:02:46.963 --> 01:02:48.562
- Yeah.
- And then, I'll...

01:02:52.201 --> 01:02:53.479
I guess I'll see you
at the party.

01:02:53.503 --> 01:02:57.471
Yeah! Yeah.
I'll be there.

01:02:57.507 --> 01:03:00.440
Right.

01:03:00.475 --> 01:03:02.409
- Bye.
- Yeah.

01:03:07.949 --> 01:03:10.150
All right, let's do this.

01:03:53.126 --> 01:03:54.459
Hi.

01:03:54.494 --> 01:03:57.295
Mrs. Deevers.

01:03:57.330 --> 01:04:00.798
I came to see how
the trial run was going.

01:04:00.867 --> 01:04:04.035
Well, I think your oven
might run a little hot.

01:04:04.070 --> 01:04:06.304
Oh, dear! Really?

01:04:06.339 --> 01:04:09.440
Should I have someone come in
and look at it, do you think?

01:04:09.476 --> 01:04:12.242
No, no.

01:04:12.277 --> 01:04:16.880
Your oven's fine.
I can't do this.

01:04:18.951 --> 01:04:22.419
I thought this trip
would get me ready

01:04:22.454 --> 01:04:26.456
so that I could take over
for my mom, but...

01:04:26.525 --> 01:04:28.058
I just, I can't do it!

01:04:28.093 --> 01:04:30.360
I let her down.

01:04:30.396 --> 01:04:31.995
No.

01:04:32.030 --> 01:04:34.231
I can't make
a snowflake pancake.

01:04:34.266 --> 01:04:36.633
I can't build a gingerbread house!

01:04:36.702 --> 01:04:38.934
I don't know
how to darn a sock.

01:04:39.003 --> 01:04:40.703
Whatever that means!

01:04:40.738 --> 01:04:42.805
It's just to sew, dear.

01:04:42.840 --> 01:04:44.774
Then, why don't they
just say that?

01:04:47.245 --> 01:04:50.346
I mean, she gave me pages
and pages of notes,

01:04:50.381 --> 01:04:53.382
and I still couldn't get it
right!

01:04:53.418 --> 01:04:55.651
Here.

01:04:55.686 --> 01:04:57.653
Oh, my!

01:04:57.688 --> 01:05:01.791
These are very good.

01:05:01.858 --> 01:05:05.326
Classic Liz Livingstone
Christmas.

01:05:05.362 --> 01:05:06.995
Yeah.

01:05:07.030 --> 01:05:13.234
But what giving the Ryans
a Candace Livingstone one?

01:05:13.270 --> 01:05:16.538
I don't even know that that is.

01:05:16.573 --> 01:05:21.509
Well, maybe this is your chance
to find out.

01:05:23.947 --> 01:05:29.983
And Candace...
your secret is safe with me, dear.

01:05:55.610 --> 01:05:57.743
Hello?

01:05:57.779 --> 01:05:59.557
<i>Hello, Ms. Livingstone,
someone's here to see you.</i>

01:05:59.581 --> 01:06:01.214
Okay.

01:06:05.720 --> 01:06:07.520
Mom!

01:06:07.589 --> 01:06:10.256
Have you tried this eggnog?

01:06:10.291 --> 01:06:11.824
It's wonderful.

01:06:15.897 --> 01:06:18.029
We're gonna have to find room
for more than 50 people.

01:06:18.065 --> 01:06:19.664
Luckily, the neighbour
three doors down,

01:06:19.700 --> 01:06:22.300
he's gonna let people park in
his driveway to avoid suspicion.

01:06:22.336 --> 01:06:23.969
- Clever.
- Yeah.

01:06:24.037 --> 01:06:26.049
And I have gone through all of
their old Christmas photos.

01:06:26.073 --> 01:06:27.739
I was thinking maybe
we could highlight

01:06:27.808 --> 01:06:29.441
some of their family traditions.

01:06:29.476 --> 01:06:31.977
I'm gonna do a dessert table
and a full Christmas dinner.

01:06:32.012 --> 01:06:34.779
It'll be mashed potatoes,
green beans, turkey.

01:06:34.815 --> 01:06:37.215
I think roast would be
more of a showstopper.

01:06:37.251 --> 01:06:38.451
You know, I can make a call...

01:06:38.485 --> 01:06:40.852
Mom?

01:06:40.888 --> 01:06:43.087
I built the menu
around the family.

01:06:43.122 --> 01:06:45.055
Every dish has a special
memory for them.

01:06:45.091 --> 01:06:46.891
Of course.

01:06:48.761 --> 01:06:52.830
Well, I'm not sure that I would
do a Brussel sprout dish

01:06:52.865 --> 01:06:55.099
with a green bean casserole.

01:06:55.134 --> 01:06:57.968
But the Ryan family would.

01:06:58.004 --> 01:06:59.803
Well, I guess I just
want it to be perfect.

01:06:59.872 --> 01:07:01.372
It will be perfect, for them.

01:07:01.407 --> 01:07:02.706
Right.

01:07:02.742 --> 01:07:04.408
Just trust me?

01:07:04.477 --> 01:07:06.809
You're the boss.

01:07:19.758 --> 01:07:21.558
Good morning!
Are you ready for the big day?

01:07:21.593 --> 01:07:23.860
I am, and I hope you don't mind,

01:07:23.895 --> 01:07:26.062
but I brought some
reinforcements.

01:07:28.333 --> 01:07:30.466
You're really her!

01:07:30.502 --> 01:07:32.100
I am.

01:07:34.305 --> 01:07:35.604
Can we come in?

01:07:35.639 --> 01:07:37.940
Of course, of course!

01:07:38.008 --> 01:07:40.976
Come!

01:07:42.513 --> 01:07:44.980
Surprise.

01:07:50.688 --> 01:07:53.455
Your house is lovely.

01:07:55.626 --> 01:07:58.059
Thanks!

01:08:00.530 --> 01:08:03.064
All right, is everyone here?

01:08:03.099 --> 01:08:04.398
Everyone but John.

01:08:04.467 --> 01:08:05.800
He's stuck at the office today,

01:08:05.835 --> 01:08:07.602
but he'll be in
as soon as he's finished.

01:08:07.637 --> 01:08:10.438
John is my other son.

01:08:10.473 --> 01:08:12.239
He took Candace on a date!

01:08:12.275 --> 01:08:14.075
Really?

01:08:14.110 --> 01:08:15.977
He was showing me around town.

01:08:16.011 --> 01:08:17.211
And he bought her flowers!

01:08:17.279 --> 01:08:18.613
Flowers?

01:08:18.648 --> 01:08:21.481
Well, it was more of a branch,

01:08:21.550 --> 01:08:23.582
with like little flowers on it.

01:08:23.618 --> 01:08:25.385
Okay!

01:08:25.420 --> 01:08:27.720
Well, we should focus on
the task at hand

01:08:27.756 --> 01:08:29.622
'cause we have a party to plan.

01:08:29.658 --> 01:08:31.191
So, here are our to-do lists.

01:08:31.259 --> 01:08:33.960
There we go, and for you.

01:08:33.996 --> 01:08:36.763
All right!

01:08:36.798 --> 01:08:40.033
Well, why don't we hop to?

01:08:47.441 --> 01:08:48.741
Come on, come on.

01:08:48.776 --> 01:08:50.709
Okay.

01:08:50.745 --> 01:08:52.344
So, I want to know everything!

01:08:52.380 --> 01:08:54.179
Mom, Mom. I will tell you
all about it later.

01:08:54.749 --> 01:08:56.682
- Later.
- Later.

01:08:56.751 --> 01:08:59.184
Yes, yes.

01:09:06.127 --> 01:09:08.227
What do you think of those?

01:09:08.261 --> 01:09:10.560
Delicious.

01:09:10.596 --> 01:09:12.596
Smell good.

01:09:13.867 --> 01:09:15.066
Looks even.

01:09:15.135 --> 01:09:16.501
Is that... is that good?

01:09:16.536 --> 01:09:17.702
Nice job, ladies.

01:09:19.372 --> 01:09:20.772
Merry Christmas, Steve.

01:09:20.807 --> 01:09:22.140
- It's great.
- We're all set.

01:09:29.349 --> 01:09:32.316
For the centrepieces.

01:09:32.352 --> 01:09:35.252
We were actually
going to do poinsettias.

01:09:35.287 --> 01:09:36.787
They're Martha's favourite
flower.

01:09:36.854 --> 01:09:38.321
Steve buys them for her
every year.

01:09:38.357 --> 01:09:40.122
But these are antique
kugel balls

01:09:40.158 --> 01:09:42.158
shipped all the way
from Germany.

01:09:42.194 --> 01:09:46.363
Mom?

01:09:46.398 --> 01:09:48.732
Maybe I could find a spot
for them in the living room.

01:09:48.767 --> 01:09:51.234
Perfect.

01:09:54.339 --> 01:09:55.906
Thanks so much for coming.

01:09:55.941 --> 01:09:57.352
You can go ahead and put
your gift in there.

01:09:57.376 --> 01:09:59.443
Thank you.

01:09:59.478 --> 01:10:02.211
It's been such a joy
to have her.

01:10:05.450 --> 01:10:06.682
You must be very proud.

01:10:06.751 --> 01:10:07.950
I am.

01:10:07.985 --> 01:10:10.419
She's so much like you.

01:10:10.455 --> 01:10:12.588
Like me?

01:10:12.623 --> 01:10:15.991
I've always felt we were
very different.

01:10:16.027 --> 01:10:17.927
Really?

01:10:17.962 --> 01:10:19.929
Well...

01:10:19.964 --> 01:10:22.064
Candace is so determined.

01:10:22.100 --> 01:10:24.667
And she's a whiz at numbers.

01:10:24.702 --> 01:10:27.001
Honestly, she talks to me

01:10:27.037 --> 01:10:28.970
about business reports
and market shares,

01:10:29.005 --> 01:10:31.139
and I find I'm a little lost.

01:10:32.976 --> 01:10:35.710
And she's always been so good
at connecting with people,

01:10:35.746 --> 01:10:39.914
understanding what makes them
feel special.

01:10:39.950 --> 01:10:44.886
To be honest, I wish I was
a little bit more like her.

01:10:48.091 --> 01:10:50.023
I think you're both
really lovely.

01:10:50.059 --> 01:10:53.927
Back at ya.

01:11:01.570 --> 01:11:04.371
Hi! Mr. and Mrs. Carlisle!
Please come in.

01:11:04.406 --> 01:11:06.306
- Hi, Candace.
- Hi.

01:11:06.342 --> 01:11:08.809
Good to see you.

01:11:12.181 --> 01:11:15.148
Mr. Carlisle,
what are you doing here?

01:11:15.183 --> 01:11:17.550
Well, your mother told me all
about this wonderful event,

01:11:17.619 --> 01:11:19.752
so well, my wife Jennifer and I

01:11:19.788 --> 01:11:21.588
thought we'd like to come
and be a part of it.

01:11:21.623 --> 01:11:23.422
Oh, really? You did?

01:11:23.458 --> 01:11:25.236
Well, Liz has been singing
your praises for weeks,

01:11:25.260 --> 01:11:28.060
and I have to admit
that I had my reservations,

01:11:28.129 --> 01:11:29.862
you know, about you
taking her place

01:11:29.931 --> 01:11:31.330
at the Livingstone company.

01:11:31.366 --> 01:11:33.599
But your trip here has been
very convincing.

01:11:33.635 --> 01:11:35.935
We've seen all of the positive
feedback on social media,

01:11:36.004 --> 01:11:38.571
and you've been a wonderful
ambassador for the brand.

01:11:38.640 --> 01:11:41.973
Thank you. Thanks.

01:11:42.009 --> 01:11:45.076
Looks like the Liz Livingstone
touch runs in the family.

01:11:46.547 --> 01:11:47.913
Well...

01:11:47.948 --> 01:11:50.682
Please, you can put the gift
by the tree. Come in.

01:11:58.091 --> 01:11:59.457
Are we there yet?

01:11:59.526 --> 01:12:01.927
Almost, keep going,
keep going, keep going.

01:12:03.163 --> 01:12:06.463
You can open your eyes.

01:12:06.499 --> 01:12:08.966
So cool!

01:12:11.671 --> 01:12:13.404
It's us!

01:12:13.439 --> 01:12:16.106
I know you were kind of
disappointed that your dad

01:12:16.142 --> 01:12:18.142
had missed all your favourite
Christmas activities.

01:12:18.177 --> 01:12:20.945
So, I thought you might want
to share these with him.

01:12:20.980 --> 01:12:23.180
Mom, look what Candace gave us!

01:12:23.216 --> 01:12:25.249
These are wonderful.

01:12:25.318 --> 01:12:27.284
He's going to love it!

01:12:27.320 --> 01:12:29.452
Well, I think a lot
of people are.

01:12:29.487 --> 01:12:32.822
Here, I want to show you
something.

01:12:34.059 --> 01:12:35.258
Excuse me.

01:12:35.293 --> 01:12:36.659
Come on over!

01:12:36.695 --> 01:12:38.895
Okay.

01:12:38.964 --> 01:12:42.365
I worked on this all last night.

01:12:42.434 --> 01:12:43.733
Ha!

01:12:45.170 --> 01:12:46.769
It's going to go live
on our website

01:12:46.805 --> 01:12:48.216
for our special
Christmas Eve edition.

01:12:48.240 --> 01:12:51.074
The perfect family Christmas.

01:12:51.142 --> 01:12:52.976
We have to show John!

01:12:53.011 --> 01:12:54.610
He's stuck at the office.

01:12:54.645 --> 01:12:56.411
He said he was finishing up
an article.

01:12:56.447 --> 01:12:57.980
He's going to miss the party!

01:12:58.048 --> 01:12:59.348
I tried calling him,

01:12:59.383 --> 01:13:01.049
but I think his phone
must be turned off.

01:13:01.085 --> 01:13:03.096
I suppose I could head on down
to the paper and get him.

01:13:03.120 --> 01:13:05.120
No, you know what?
I can go.

01:13:05.155 --> 01:13:06.455
Are you sure?

01:13:06.490 --> 01:13:08.223
Yeah, it's fine.

01:13:08.259 --> 01:13:10.237
I have to go home and change
for the party tonight, anyway.

01:13:10.261 --> 01:13:12.027
So, I'll just swing by
on my way back.

01:13:12.062 --> 01:13:13.495
Great!

01:13:13.530 --> 01:13:15.030
All right,
I'll see you in a bit.

01:13:15.065 --> 01:13:17.132
Okay, if you run
into any trouble,

01:13:17.167 --> 01:13:18.667
just call me on my cell.

01:13:18.702 --> 01:13:21.802
So, I'm looking forward
to meeting John.

01:13:21.871 --> 01:13:23.404
Mom!

01:13:23.439 --> 01:13:25.806
It sounds like he made
a real impression on you.

01:13:25.842 --> 01:13:27.375
He really did.

01:13:27.410 --> 01:13:30.578
But I haven't been exactly
honest with him.

01:13:30.613 --> 01:13:33.214
I'll explain it later.

01:13:33.249 --> 01:13:36.517
Look, I know it can be scary
putting your heart out there,

01:13:36.552 --> 01:13:40.454
but some people are worth
the risk.

01:13:40.490 --> 01:13:42.790
Thanks, Mom.

01:13:42.825 --> 01:13:44.391
All right,
I'll see you in a bit.

01:13:44.426 --> 01:13:46.893
See you.

01:14:07.816 --> 01:14:10.182
Hey.

01:14:10.217 --> 01:14:13.085
- Big story?
- Yeah.

01:14:13.154 --> 01:14:15.788
What are you doing here?

01:14:15.823 --> 01:14:17.623
I wanted to talk to you
about something.

01:14:17.658 --> 01:14:19.024
Okay, what is it?

01:14:19.093 --> 01:14:21.393
Well...

01:14:21.429 --> 01:14:22.861
I don't really know
how to say this,

01:14:22.897 --> 01:14:24.229
so I'm just gonna say it.

01:14:24.265 --> 01:14:25.497
I...

01:14:25.533 --> 01:14:28.067
John, I need that copy today.

01:14:28.102 --> 01:14:30.836
Yeah, no, yeah,
I'll be right there.

01:14:30.905 --> 01:14:32.616
Just give me one second?
I'll be right back.

01:14:32.640 --> 01:14:33.972
Yeah, of course.

01:14:34.040 --> 01:14:35.540
Okay, just got to...

01:14:40.847 --> 01:14:44.115
You look really good.

01:14:44.150 --> 01:14:45.984
Thanks.

01:14:55.495 --> 01:14:57.161
What's this?

01:14:57.197 --> 01:14:59.896
"Scarf", "price tag".

01:14:59.932 --> 01:15:02.399
"The real Candace Livingstone"?

01:15:19.351 --> 01:15:21.651
Sorry about that...

01:15:56.620 --> 01:15:58.753
Steve! You're here.

01:15:58.822 --> 01:16:00.655
Yeah, my flight got in early.

01:16:00.690 --> 01:16:02.290
I thought I'd come
and surprise everyone.

01:16:02.325 --> 01:16:04.125
You know, you look a lot like...

01:16:04.161 --> 01:16:05.427
Yeah, I am.

01:16:05.462 --> 01:16:08.897
Could you do me a favour,
and like, count to 20,

01:16:08.932 --> 01:16:11.332
and then, act surprised
when you go in.

01:16:11.368 --> 01:16:12.634
Okay, yeah, okay, great!

01:16:12.669 --> 01:16:15.402
O... Kay.

01:16:17.773 --> 01:16:20.374
Let me get that.
There you go.

01:16:24.313 --> 01:16:26.146
You guys,
I just saw Steve pull in!

01:16:26.182 --> 01:16:27.948
He's here! He's here!

01:16:29.351 --> 01:16:32.252
Get the lights!

01:16:32.288 --> 01:16:35.722
What the...

01:16:35.791 --> 01:16:36.990
Okay, ready?

01:16:39.828 --> 01:16:41.761
Hello?

01:16:41.796 --> 01:16:44.430
Hello!

01:16:46.234 --> 01:16:48.367
Surprise!

01:16:48.403 --> 01:16:50.970
Welcome home!

01:16:51.005 --> 01:16:52.271
Dad!

01:16:54.409 --> 01:16:57.343
- Merry Christmas, kiddo!
- Merry Christmas, Dad!

01:16:59.581 --> 01:17:02.981
- You're back.
- I'm back.

01:17:04.384 --> 01:17:08.854
- I missed you.
- Missed you, too.

01:17:10.424 --> 01:17:12.324
Merry Christmas.

01:17:12.359 --> 01:17:14.459
Son, it's so good
to have you home.

01:17:15.762 --> 01:17:17.262
It's so good to see you.

01:17:17.297 --> 01:17:19.264
Dad, look who's here!

01:17:19.299 --> 01:17:23.401
- Merry Christmas, Steve.
- Liz Livingstone?

01:17:23.470 --> 01:17:26.138
And thank you for your service.

01:17:26.173 --> 01:17:28.906
Well, thank you
for your gingersnaps.

01:17:31.677 --> 01:17:33.644
Anytime!

01:17:33.679 --> 01:17:37.014
They made the whole
Christmas dinner.

01:17:37.049 --> 01:17:39.150
All your favourites.
I helped!

01:17:39.185 --> 01:17:42.286
Well, lead the way, kiddo.
Let's go!

01:17:42.355 --> 01:17:43.954
It's Christmas!

01:17:45.525 --> 01:17:48.125
- Nice work, Mom.
- Yeah, you did good, too.

01:17:58.036 --> 01:18:01.437
Welcome home, son!

01:18:01.473 --> 01:18:03.940
It's great to be home, Mom.

01:18:06.745 --> 01:18:10.013
I'd like to give a special
thank you to Candace

01:18:10.048 --> 01:18:13.750
for helping to make this day
truly special.

01:18:16.655 --> 01:18:18.921
Well...

01:18:18.956 --> 01:18:21.023
really, it's me who should be
thanking you.

01:18:21.058 --> 01:18:23.659
All of you.

01:18:23.694 --> 01:18:27.396
You've made me feel
like a part of the family.

01:18:32.102 --> 01:18:35.537
But I haven't been honest
with you.

01:18:35.573 --> 01:18:39.775
The truth is, I'm nothing
like my mother.

01:18:39.810 --> 01:18:43.377
I'm not particularly crafty.

01:18:43.413 --> 01:18:46.547
I make horrible gingerbread
houses.

01:18:48.518 --> 01:18:50.663
And I could never cook such
a beautiful Christmas dinner

01:18:50.687 --> 01:18:52.753
on my own.

01:18:52.789 --> 01:18:56.724
I spent my whole life trying
to be perfect just like her,

01:18:56.759 --> 01:19:00.928
and I'm not perfect at all.

01:19:05.368 --> 01:19:08.868
But I'm starting to see
that that's okay.

01:19:08.904 --> 01:19:12.672
You know, Christmas isn't
about perfection.

01:19:12.708 --> 01:19:15.442
It's about this,

01:19:15.477 --> 01:19:19.613
and spending time with our
friends and our family,

01:19:19.681 --> 01:19:23.350
and the people that we love.

01:19:24.653 --> 01:19:25.819
That's so true.

01:19:25.854 --> 01:19:28.388
- Hear, hear!
- Hear, hear!

01:19:28.423 --> 01:19:29.756
Yeah, cheers!

01:19:29.791 --> 01:19:31.424
Thank you.

01:19:31.460 --> 01:19:34.293
Well, dig in, everyone!
Don't be shy!

01:19:34.328 --> 01:19:35.861
Merry Christmas!

01:19:35.896 --> 01:19:37.463
Get out of the way,
I got two helpings.

01:19:43.337 --> 01:19:44.536
Excuse me.

01:19:44.572 --> 01:19:47.039
- Hey, little brother.
- Hey.

01:19:48.309 --> 01:19:50.943
- Welcome home.
- Thanks, man.

01:19:56.817 --> 01:19:58.616
James, just...

01:19:58.652 --> 01:20:01.486
Liz, please,
just give me a second.

01:20:03.890 --> 01:20:06.924
That was certainly
an interesting speech.

01:20:06.960 --> 01:20:10.461
I think it's the right direction
for the magazine.

01:20:10.497 --> 01:20:12.764
At Livingstone,
there is a place for everyone.

01:20:17.537 --> 01:20:21.539
You know what, Liz?
You were right.

01:20:21.574 --> 01:20:24.041
She is perfect for the job.

01:20:25.511 --> 01:20:30.013
Well, she is my daughter.

01:20:30.049 --> 01:20:31.281
You got my vote.

01:20:32.885 --> 01:20:34.518
Thank you, Mr. Carlisle.

01:20:37.156 --> 01:20:40.090
- This calls for a toast.
- Let's do it!

01:20:40.125 --> 01:20:41.692
Yeah, I'll be right there.

01:20:41.727 --> 01:20:44.194
Okay.

01:20:58.176 --> 01:21:02.178
Leaving already?

01:21:02.246 --> 01:21:05.114
That was the idea.
I said my goodbyes.

01:21:05.149 --> 01:21:07.717
You didn't say goodbye to me.

01:21:07.752 --> 01:21:09.418
Goodbye.

01:21:09.487 --> 01:21:11.187
Just wait.

01:21:13.657 --> 01:21:16.324
You haven't even read it.

01:21:20.230 --> 01:21:22.664
I don't need to read it.

01:21:22.699 --> 01:21:25.800
I saw a preview of it
on your desk.

01:21:25.836 --> 01:21:28.737
Sorry I told the truth in there.

01:21:28.772 --> 01:21:31.272
I guess you don't have
your scoop anymore.

01:21:31.341 --> 01:21:33.208
It's not a scoop
if I didn't write about it.

01:21:33.243 --> 01:21:35.543
Well, what did you write about?

01:21:35.612 --> 01:21:37.444
You.

01:21:37.480 --> 01:21:39.113
You don't know me.

01:21:39.148 --> 01:21:42.783
I've been pretending to be
somebody else

01:21:42.852 --> 01:21:44.351
the whole week I've been here.

01:21:44.387 --> 01:21:45.919
I'm a reporter.

01:21:45.955 --> 01:21:48.288
My job is to find out the truth,

01:21:48.324 --> 01:21:50.457
and I found out who you are.

01:21:50.493 --> 01:21:54.294
You're smart
and you're thoughtful,

01:21:54.363 --> 01:21:56.730
and you are creative.

01:21:56.766 --> 01:22:00.434
You love gingerbread cookies,

01:22:00.469 --> 01:22:03.770
even if the houses give you
a little bit of trouble.

01:22:03.805 --> 01:22:05.405
You see the best in people,

01:22:05.440 --> 01:22:07.680
and you are the kind of person
that would drop everything

01:22:07.709 --> 01:22:12.678
to help a little girl
you don't even know.

01:22:12.714 --> 01:22:15.415
You're Candace Livingstone.

01:22:15.450 --> 01:22:19.852
I am,

01:22:19.888 --> 01:22:24.123
but I'm not perfect.

01:22:24.159 --> 01:22:27.459
You are for me.

01:22:47.981 --> 01:22:49.147
I knew it.

01:22:49.183 --> 01:22:51.982
So, that must be John.

01:22:52.051 --> 01:22:55.553
Okay, looks like we got
an audience.

01:22:57.390 --> 01:23:00.958
Well, that is life
in the spotlight.

01:23:00.993 --> 01:23:03.294
Think you can handle it?

01:23:03.329 --> 01:23:05.629
I'd like to give it a shot.
