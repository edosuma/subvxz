WEBVTT

00:00.484 --> 00:03.386
I'm here!
I'm here, I'm here.

00:03.388 --> 00:04.902
You can start the meeting now.

00:04.903 --> 00:05.869
The meeting is over.
You're late.

00:05.871 --> 00:08.170
You missed roll call
and the tutorial

00:08.173 --> 00:09.506
on using the new copiers.

00:09.508 --> 00:11.808
Six years, and no matter
how hard I try, I still can't

00:11.810 --> 00:13.256
get you to understand the
importance of being punctual.

00:13.257 --> 00:15.071
Maybe you should just give up
and accept me for who I am?

00:15.073 --> 00:16.138
No, I will break you.

00:16.140 --> 00:17.607
- Right now.
- Oh.

00:17.609 --> 00:18.893
While you were out being tardy,

00:18.894 --> 00:20.961
I was hard at work
devising a special punishment.

00:20.963 --> 00:23.559
I've crafted an intricate
personal high five

00:23.560 --> 00:25.690
with everyone in this office
except you.

00:25.692 --> 00:27.125
What?
But you hate high fives.

00:27.127 --> 00:29.460
Yes, every minute of it
was hell.

00:29.462 --> 00:32.363
But it'll be worse for you.
Squad, dismissed.

00:32.365 --> 00:34.999
Good-bye, Diaz.

00:35.001 --> 00:36.334
Salute into a fanny waggle?

00:36.336 --> 00:39.070
- Good-bye, Boyle.
- Oh, the snake charmer!

00:39.072 --> 00:41.272
Good-bye, Jeffords.

00:41.274 --> 00:43.441
- That's a butt bump.
- Good-bye, Santiago.

00:43.443 --> 00:45.409
Double fist bump
reverse explosion

00:45.411 --> 00:47.245
into a Pete Townshend strum.

00:47.247 --> 00:49.780
All right, that was terrible,

00:49.782 --> 00:51.315
but it's over now,
and I made it through.

00:51.317 --> 00:52.383
Good-bye, Leonard from Xerox.

00:52.385 --> 00:54.886
What?
No, no, no.

00:54.888 --> 00:55.880
The copy guy?

00:55.910 --> 00:57.264
<font color="#00FFFF">Synced & corrected by</font> <font color="#D81D1D">MaxPayne</font>

Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:15.975 --> 01:17.375
So nice of you to stop by,
Kevin.

01:17.377 --> 01:18.678
Enjoy your day.
I hope it's productive.

01:18.679 --> 01:19.418
Thank you, Raymond.

01:19.419 --> 01:20.985
I hope your day
is productive as well.

01:22.244 --> 01:23.931
PDA in the office?
My, my.

01:23.933 --> 01:25.366
- Couldn't help myself.
- Hmm.

01:25.368 --> 01:27.134
Oh, may I please use
the precinct facilities

01:27.136 --> 01:28.290
before I head to work?

01:28.291 --> 01:29.812
Yes. Thank you for asking
for permission.

01:29.812 --> 01:33.380
Thank you for granting it.

01:35.317 --> 01:37.317
Whoomp.
There it is!

01:37.811 --> 01:38.576
Got to say, I could have used

01:38.578 --> 01:39.747
a little more oomph
on the whoomp.

01:39.748 --> 01:40.962
That's the oomphiest whoomp
you'll get.

01:40.963 --> 01:42.306
So what's going on? Why'd you
want to meet in private?

01:42.307 --> 01:43.407
I need your help with a case.

01:43.409 --> 01:44.618
Three antique coins were stolen

01:44.619 --> 01:46.085
from my classics department
at Columbia.

01:46.087 --> 01:47.720
So why not ask Captain Holt
for help on the case?

01:47.722 --> 01:48.788
Wait, are you guys getting
a divorce?

01:48.790 --> 01:50.823
I can handle it.

01:50.825 --> 01:52.391
This doesn't bring up
any weird issues for me.

01:52.393 --> 01:53.559
No, it's nothing like that.

01:53.561 --> 01:54.660
Raymond's a brilliant detective.

01:54.662 --> 01:56.162
It's just when a case
involves me,

01:56.164 --> 01:58.183
he can get a little
overemotional.

01:58.184 --> 02:00.878
- You remember the safe house.
- Oh, yeah, he went crazy.

02:00.879 --> 02:02.795
But I also remember you and me
becoming best friends

02:02.796 --> 02:04.200
and watching every Nic Cage
movie ever made.

02:04.201 --> 02:05.094
Can you still quote them all?

02:05.095 --> 02:06.777
No, I purged myself
of that nonsense.

02:06.778 --> 02:08.014
- Oh, I bet it's still in there.
- It's not.

02:08.015 --> 02:08.401
- We'll see.
- We won't.

02:08.402 --> 02:09.783
- There's a chance it's in there.
- Chance of zero.

02:09.785 --> 02:11.517
I'd put money
that maybe it's there.

02:11.518 --> 02:12.450
- You're losing your money.
- Okay.

02:12.452 --> 02:14.419
- So will you help me?
- I don't know.

02:14.421 --> 02:15.787
I want to, but keeping a secret
from Holt?

02:15.789 --> 02:16.938
- That's a lot of pressure.
- Hmm.

02:16.939 --> 02:17.964
Am I remembering correctly?

02:17.965 --> 02:20.508
Don't you...
eat pressure for breakfast?

02:20.509 --> 02:23.343
Nic Cage in "The Rock."

02:23.345 --> 02:25.445
We are best friends.
I am so in!

02:25.447 --> 02:27.080
Oh, no, that's Raymond.

02:27.082 --> 02:28.081
That's how he opens a door.

02:28.083 --> 02:29.081
Kevin, are you still in here?

02:29.082 --> 02:30.915
Uh, yes, Raymond,
I'm in the stall.

02:30.917 --> 02:32.450
Some tickets were just released

02:32.452 --> 02:34.785
for Mahler's Fourth Symphony
this weekend.

02:34.787 --> 02:36.320
Great. That sounds great.
Let's do it.

02:36.322 --> 02:38.340
Fantastic. Now, which section
do you prefer?

02:38.341 --> 02:40.041
The first tier,

02:40.043 --> 02:42.276
the second tier,
the third tier...

02:42.278 --> 02:43.224
The first tier.

02:43.225 --> 02:44.891
Now, which section
of the first tier?

02:44.893 --> 02:49.709
Right, left, right center,
center...

02:49.710 --> 02:50.965
Just any section is fine.

02:50.966 --> 02:51.998
Any section, wow.

02:52.000 --> 02:53.934
Someone had pepper
on their eggs this morning.

02:53.936 --> 02:55.902
I'll buy the tickets.

02:55.904 --> 02:58.638
Any section.

02:58.640 --> 02:59.879
Guys, horrible news.

02:59.879 --> 03:01.612
The fridge broke this morning.
Everything's warm.

03:01.614 --> 03:02.947
Doesn't seem like
that big a deal.

03:02.949 --> 03:04.975
- Your yogurt's spoiled.
- Who did this?

03:04.977 --> 03:06.694
Okay, everyone calm down.

03:06.695 --> 03:08.395
I will put a request in
for a new fridge.

03:08.397 --> 03:09.763
Good luck getting that approved.

03:09.765 --> 03:11.187
Commissioner Kelly's already
slashed our budget

03:11.188 --> 03:11.973
within an inch of its life.

03:11.974 --> 03:13.798
Yeah, the toilet paper's
only one ply now.

03:13.799 --> 03:15.949
- My butt hurts all the time.
- The AC is broken.

03:15.950 --> 03:16.839
My butt hurts all the time.

03:16.840 --> 03:18.273
Scully's butt hurts
all the time.

03:18.275 --> 03:19.541
All right, guys, we get it.

03:19.542 --> 03:21.175
It's just that lunch
is the one part of the day

03:21.177 --> 03:22.643
Commissioner Kelly
hadn't ruined.

03:22.645 --> 03:24.827
People are pissed.
Morale's really taken a hit.

03:24.829 --> 03:26.896
Okay, I got this.

03:26.898 --> 03:28.698
Hey, squad.
Lunch is on me today.

03:28.700 --> 03:30.366
Taking everyone out for pizza.

03:31.836 --> 03:33.436
And that's how you improve
morale.

03:33.438 --> 03:35.738
Okay. You're not the only
sergeant around here.

03:35.740 --> 03:36.356
Let me help.

03:36.357 --> 03:39.196
This side of the room,
lunch is on me,

03:39.197 --> 03:41.698
and we're getting something
better than pizza.

03:41.700 --> 03:42.866
Sushi!

03:44.469 --> 03:45.902
Are you trying to outdo me?

03:45.904 --> 03:47.771
No, no, no.

03:47.773 --> 03:50.240
Just trying to raise morale.

03:50.242 --> 03:51.741
Cool.
Cool, cool, cool.

03:51.743 --> 03:54.277
Morale, morale, morale.
Okay.

03:54.279 --> 03:56.880
Wow, so this is your classroom.

03:56.882 --> 03:58.248
What's today's lecture about?

03:58.347 --> 04:00.013
I know you don't care
about that.

04:00.015 --> 04:01.147
Just ask me what you want
to ask me.

04:01.149 --> 04:02.270
Can I play
with your laser pointer?

04:02.273 --> 04:04.573
You know, the laser pointer
is a bit of a misnomer.

04:04.575 --> 04:07.109
It is simply a laser.
The pointer is you.

04:07.111 --> 04:10.035
- That was awesome.
- Take it for a spin.

04:10.036 --> 04:12.270
Don't mind if I do.
Good afternoon, class.

04:12.272 --> 04:15.140
Allow me to make my first...
point.

04:15.142 --> 04:17.274
- Very impressive.
- Thank you very much, Kevin.

04:17.277 --> 04:19.244
But I do have five additional
points to make.

04:19.245 --> 04:22.113
Chair, chair, wall, chair,

04:22.115 --> 04:23.114
Captain Holt.

04:23.116 --> 04:24.682
Captain Holt? No.

04:24.684 --> 04:28.019
Yes, that was
a delicious lunch, Gary!

04:28.021 --> 04:30.188
And I agree,
our group does seem happier

04:30.190 --> 04:31.289
than it was before.

04:31.291 --> 04:32.620
Oh, the pizza was that good?

04:32.621 --> 04:35.483
Pizza? Right, that's what
I said we were getting

04:35.484 --> 04:38.051
before we decided to
uh-snazz it up.

04:38.053 --> 04:39.786
Oh, you guys snazzed?

04:39.788 --> 04:42.589
Yeah, we snazzed all the way
to La Petite Creperie.

04:42.591 --> 04:44.257
I thought we couldn't say
"snazz."

04:44.259 --> 04:46.626
Oh, no, I was thinking of f***.

04:46.628 --> 04:47.894
We can't say f***.
Carry on.

04:47.896 --> 04:49.596
Tell 'em how good it was, Rosa.

04:49.598 --> 04:51.798
Tell 'em how high our morale is.

04:51.800 --> 04:53.633
- High.
- Oh, stop gushing, girl.

04:53.635 --> 04:54.848
I think it's so interesting

04:54.849 --> 04:56.891
you guys didn't stick
to your original plan,

04:56.892 --> 04:58.959
because neither did we.

04:58.960 --> 04:59.918
What? Why?

04:59.919 --> 05:01.952
Oh, you don't think we knew
you were gonna snazz?

05:01.954 --> 05:05.310
We saw your snazz
coming a mile away.

05:05.311 --> 05:07.111
That's why I took my team out

05:07.113 --> 05:09.580
for some big, juicy steaks,
and...

05:09.582 --> 05:11.115
<i>♪ Mashed potatoes ♪</i>

05:11.117 --> 05:14.218
<i>♪ And some spinach
and some key lime pie ♪</i>

05:14.220 --> 05:15.101
- Thank you, Heather.
- Mm-hmm.

05:15.103 --> 05:16.788
Well, that doesn't sound
better than crepes.

05:16.789 --> 05:18.063
It is.
Terry wins.

05:18.064 --> 05:19.897
We know.
We were at both lunches.

05:19.899 --> 05:22.166
How? They were simultaneous
and two miles apart.

05:22.168 --> 05:24.001
It was free food.
Life finds a way.

05:24.003 --> 05:25.236
Okay, but you can't win

05:25.238 --> 05:26.671
because it wasn't a competition.

05:26.673 --> 05:27.705
So let's make it a competition.

05:27.707 --> 05:28.910
Same groups tomorrow?

05:28.912 --> 05:30.712
Okay, but let's agree
at the end of this

05:30.714 --> 05:32.280
- that we'll still be friends.
- No deal.

05:32.282 --> 05:34.015
Good!
'Cause I didn't mean it anyway.

05:34.017 --> 05:35.874
Hello, sir.
How'd you find us out?

05:35.875 --> 05:37.040
Mahler's Fourth Symphony.

05:37.042 --> 05:38.517
He'd never sit
in just any section.

05:38.518 --> 05:39.917
I might.
I'm flexible.

05:39.919 --> 05:42.787
Oh, really?
You'd sit center left?

05:42.789 --> 05:44.397
In timpani alley?

05:44.401 --> 05:46.017
I'll purchase those tickets
right away.

05:51.909 --> 05:53.341
No, don't!
Fine.

05:53.343 --> 05:54.709
Jake is helping me
with a burglary

05:54.711 --> 05:55.477
here at the university,

05:55.479 --> 05:57.445
and I asked him not to tell you.

05:57.446 --> 05:59.580
- Is this about St. Augustine?
- Yes.

05:59.582 --> 06:01.108
- What's going on?
- He's embarrassed of me.

06:01.110 --> 06:01.844
Last Christmas,

06:01.848 --> 06:03.798
the classics department
threw a holiday party.

06:03.800 --> 06:07.938
I had one drink too many
and utterly humiliated myself.

06:07.940 --> 06:09.740
And that was the point
St. Augustine was making

06:09.742 --> 06:10.941
in "Consolation of Philosophy."

06:10.943 --> 06:12.643
Yeah, sounds super humiliating,

06:12.645 --> 06:13.644
saying something smart.

06:13.646 --> 06:16.480
Smart? I confused
St. Augustine with Boethius.

06:16.482 --> 06:17.815
I might as well
have stepped on a rake

06:17.817 --> 06:18.977
and bonked myself
on the forehead.

06:18.978 --> 06:20.044
The problem
wasn't what you said.

06:20.046 --> 06:22.489
It was that Dean Allister
pointed out your mistake,

06:22.490 --> 06:23.498
and you lost your damned mind.

06:23.599 --> 06:26.463
I misremembered it because
I'm reading both simultaneously.

06:26.466 --> 06:28.265
One book is too few for me.

06:28.267 --> 06:29.266
Where is everyone going?

06:30.570 --> 06:32.236
It was quite the kerfuffle.

06:32.238 --> 06:34.538
The problem is, is that I get
flustered and defensive

06:34.540 --> 06:37.141
because I know
how they all see me:

06:37.143 --> 06:40.344
as Kevin's working-class bimbo.

06:40.346 --> 06:41.821
I can't imagine
that's what they think.

06:41.822 --> 06:42.534
- It is.
- Really?

06:42.535 --> 06:43.902
Obviously I know
that they're wrong,

06:43.903 --> 06:45.501
but they put you
in your own head,

06:45.502 --> 06:46.575
and you're not yourself
around them.

06:46.576 --> 06:48.643
I'm sorry, I was just
trying to protect you.

06:48.645 --> 06:50.965
Yes, of course, thank you
for saving me from myself.

06:50.966 --> 06:52.129
Now, if you'll excuse me,

06:52.175 --> 06:55.276
I'll just go sit by the pool
and read some fiction...

06:55.278 --> 06:59.513
like the bimbo that I am.

06:59.515 --> 07:01.482
There's a pool here?

07:03.377 --> 07:07.205
Sir, wait. Oh! Wasn't expecting
to catch up to you so fast.

07:07.239 --> 07:08.738
I don't know what to say now.
I thought I was gonna have

07:08.740 --> 07:10.907
more running time
to formulate it. Oh, I know!

07:10.909 --> 07:12.609
I'm sorry that we kept the case
a secret from you.

07:12.611 --> 07:13.910
Oh, I understand why you did.

07:13.912 --> 07:15.579
The truth is,
ever since I met Kevin,

07:15.581 --> 07:17.414
I've felt insecure in his world.

07:17.416 --> 07:20.584
I can't compete with these
highly educated academics.

07:20.586 --> 07:21.751
I worry every day

07:21.753 --> 07:24.721
that I'll make one
St. Augustine slip too many,

07:24.723 --> 07:27.591
and he'll realize...

07:27.593 --> 07:28.959
- I'm beneath him.
- This is insane.

07:28.961 --> 07:30.527
You're the smartest person
I know.

07:30.529 --> 07:32.963
I'll explain it to you.
Among Kevin's peers,

07:32.965 --> 07:34.631
- I'm a Jake.
- No, no, no, no, no.

07:34.633 --> 07:36.585
I refuse to live in a world
where you're the Jake,

07:36.586 --> 07:38.653
because if you're the Jake,
what does that make me?

07:38.655 --> 07:40.055
- The Charles?
- The Hitchcock.

07:40.057 --> 07:42.424
The Hitchcock?
Oh, my God.

07:42.426 --> 07:44.693
You dropped down so many more
levels than I was expecting.

07:44.695 --> 07:46.594
Okay, you know what?
Screw this.

07:46.596 --> 07:49.158
You are so smart, and we're gonna
prove it to those professors.

07:49.159 --> 07:50.358
You're gonna work this case,

07:50.360 --> 07:51.927
and you're gonna find
those coins.

07:52.580 --> 07:54.980
Well, I suppose
it would be nice to show them

07:54.982 --> 07:57.382
I'm more than just a hot,
dumb piece of ass.

07:57.384 --> 07:58.884
Yes! That's the spirit.

07:58.886 --> 08:00.252
Now get that hot ass moving,

08:00.254 --> 08:01.486
'cause we've got a crime
to solve.

08:01.488 --> 08:03.121
Peralta, please,
have some decorum.

08:03.123 --> 08:04.590
What?
I was just using your words.

08:04.592 --> 08:06.325
Look, you teach people
the way you want to be treated.

08:06.327 --> 08:07.993
That's what Dr. Phil says.

08:07.995 --> 08:10.896
Okay, lunchtime starts
in ten minutes.

08:10.898 --> 08:12.598
Whichever team wins
gets recorded

08:12.600 --> 08:14.166
on the Whiteboard of Victory.

08:14.168 --> 08:15.634
The winner will be decided
by our judges,

08:15.636 --> 08:16.769
Hitchcock and Scully.

08:16.770 --> 08:18.925
Oh, my God, are we
high status, Hitchcock?

08:18.926 --> 08:20.726
- I think so.
- What a world.

08:20.728 --> 08:21.577
Ah, well, good luck.

08:21.578 --> 08:23.511
I'm sure you know
all the best places to eat

08:23.513 --> 08:25.214
since you've reached
Elite status on Yelp.

08:25.215 --> 08:26.548
Oh, wait, that was me.

08:26.550 --> 08:27.616
Oh, because Yelp reviewers

08:27.618 --> 08:29.257
are sane people
with great taste?

08:29.258 --> 08:31.902
Oh, sorry, couldn't hear you
over GourmetGlen12 saying

08:31.903 --> 08:33.903
that my review of the duck skin
at the Hearth and Feather

08:33.905 --> 08:35.337
was helpful.

08:35.340 --> 08:38.407
Come on, Team Jeffords.
It's chow time.

08:39.577 --> 08:41.510
We have a cool thing to say too.

08:41.513 --> 08:44.380
Team Santiago,
let's lunch-a-bunch!

08:44.382 --> 08:46.816
- No, I don't say that.
- Come on, Rosa, please?

08:46.818 --> 08:47.850
Let's lunch-a-bunch.

08:47.852 --> 08:49.051
Aha, Rosa said it!

08:49.053 --> 08:50.553
Did you hear that?
Did you hear it?

08:50.555 --> 08:54.157
- Ah, Dean Allister?
- Policeman Raymond.

08:54.159 --> 08:56.192
Good to see you.

08:56.194 --> 08:58.261
Read any interesting magazines
lately?

08:58.263 --> 08:59.829
This again?
I was waiting for Kevin,

08:59.831 --> 09:02.031
I had finished my book,
and I happened to glance

09:02.033 --> 09:04.901
at an issue of "The Economist"
that someone left lying about.

09:04.903 --> 09:06.936
All I remember
is you becoming unhinged.

09:06.938 --> 09:08.905
The only reason I
picked it up was to swat a fly.

09:08.907 --> 09:10.106
I mean, I'm not crazy.

09:10.108 --> 09:12.241
Why are there always flowers
here?

09:12.243 --> 09:15.111
So is policeman Raymond
joining the case?

09:15.113 --> 09:16.612
Actually, he's leading it.

09:16.614 --> 09:18.447
Captain Holt
is the finest investigator

09:18.449 --> 09:19.618
I've ever worked with.

09:19.619 --> 09:20.925
Sir, tell him our plan of action.

09:28.243 --> 09:29.615
- Clues.
- Okay, you're freezing up.

09:29.616 --> 09:31.116
I'm just gonna take the wheel
for now.

09:31.118 --> 09:32.517
There were no signs
of forced entry,

09:32.519 --> 09:34.252
the only people with access
to the archives

09:34.254 --> 09:35.554
were the professors
in the department,

09:35.556 --> 09:37.982
and they all have alibis,
which means...

09:39.217 --> 09:40.088
I don't know
what you want me to say.

09:40.089 --> 09:41.789
Okay, that's my fault
for throwing it to you again.

09:41.791 --> 09:43.940
Which means we need to examine
the crime scene.

09:43.941 --> 09:44.973
It is there that we will find

09:44.974 --> 09:48.037
what Captain Holt has
so eloquently described as...

09:49.983 --> 09:50.748
Clues?

09:50.750 --> 09:52.383
Sir, you just said it.

09:52.385 --> 09:54.485
Cupcakes up, everyone.

09:54.487 --> 09:56.421
Heather, you already ate yours?

09:56.423 --> 09:58.122
The point is to eat it
in their faces.

10:01.161 --> 10:03.127
- Honk, honk, bitches.
- What the hell?

10:03.129 --> 10:04.196
We rented a party limo,

10:04.198 --> 10:05.497
drove to Coney Island
for hot dogs,

10:05.499 --> 10:07.399
and then did karaoke
the entire time.

10:07.401 --> 10:09.167
I sang "It Wasn't Me"
by Shaggy. Crushed it.

10:09.169 --> 10:10.368
But that's not even about lunch!

10:10.628 --> 10:12.091
- It's...
- An experience.

10:12.092 --> 10:13.491
- Team Amy wins.
- What?

10:13.493 --> 10:15.426
How did you get there?
You were just with us.

10:15.428 --> 10:17.495
- Scully was with them.
- Free food.

10:17.497 --> 10:19.531
Great cupcake, Sarge.

10:19.533 --> 10:23.501
But Amy still wins.
Eat snazz, losers!

10:24.838 --> 10:26.271
Okay, so there were
no witnesses,

10:26.273 --> 10:27.505
no cameras, and no prints.

10:27.507 --> 10:29.174
In other words, we have nothing.

10:29.176 --> 10:31.109
That's what you get when you
put a bimbo on the case.

10:31.111 --> 10:33.278
Okay, well, let's not give up
all hope just yet.

10:33.280 --> 10:34.513
We do know some things.

10:34.517 --> 10:36.350
For example,
the perp entered using a key,

10:36.352 --> 10:37.852
which means they probably
work here.

10:37.854 --> 10:39.453
And they knew enough
to skip past

10:39.455 --> 10:41.422
all these expensive-looking
artifacts.

10:41.424 --> 10:43.090
They walked straight up
to this shelf

10:43.092 --> 10:44.492
and grabbed the coin case
from up there.

10:44.494 --> 10:45.392
It's too high.
You can't reach it.

10:45.394 --> 10:47.328
Exactly.
So now we know that the thief

10:47.330 --> 10:48.863
was taller than me.
That's a good lead.

10:48.866 --> 10:50.632
Also, we know they were
a little bit of a freak,

10:50.634 --> 10:53.882
since I am above average height
according to the 1940 census.

10:53.883 --> 10:54.997
I didn't realize you had
a thing about your height.

10:54.998 --> 10:57.231
I don't!
Because I'm above average.

10:57.233 --> 10:58.640
Why would I have a thing
about my height

10:58.641 --> 11:01.375
when I'm above average? It doesn't
make any sense.

11:01.557 --> 11:03.936
Anyways, we're looking
for an insanely tall perp,

11:03.937 --> 11:04.762
a real Shaq type.

11:04.763 --> 11:06.894
Maybe the thief stood
on something, like...

11:06.895 --> 11:10.096
one of these drawers.

11:10.098 --> 11:11.998
Turn off the light.

11:12.000 --> 11:15.936
Maybe something will show up
under UV.

11:15.938 --> 11:17.838
- Bingpot!
- A footprint.

11:17.840 --> 11:20.008
You did it, you brilliant bimbo.

11:20.009 --> 11:22.209
Oh, there you are.
Why are you in the dark?

11:22.211 --> 11:23.726
Were you not able to find
the light switch?

11:23.727 --> 11:26.535
Ha-ha, very funny,
but I'll actually have you know

11:26.536 --> 11:28.336
Captain Holt just found
a very promising lead.

11:28.338 --> 11:29.704
Oh, how fun, a lead.

11:29.706 --> 11:31.206
Meanwhile,
we actually found the thief.

11:31.208 --> 11:32.293
- You did?
- What?

11:32.294 --> 11:34.243
Well, technically
our janitor found him.

11:34.244 --> 11:35.037
Come on in, Randy.

11:35.039 --> 11:36.238
Tell them how you did
their jobs.

11:36.240 --> 11:38.775
Well, um,
I was emptying the trash

11:38.777 --> 11:39.821
in Professor Port's office.

11:39.822 --> 11:42.983
I saw something shiny sticking
out from underneath a notepad.

11:42.984 --> 11:44.717
It was one of the missing coins.

11:44.719 --> 11:46.285
Great police work.

11:46.287 --> 11:48.387
Perhaps you might want
to hire Randy, or...

11:48.389 --> 11:50.756
Randy, you could hire them.

11:50.758 --> 11:54.961
It seems like you all have basically
the same skill set.

11:54.966 --> 11:56.685
We're actually all staffed up
in maintenance.

11:56.686 --> 11:58.652
We don't want your job, Randy.

12:00.211 --> 12:03.331
I know Dean Allister Humiliated us,
but we can still have our revenge.

12:03.332 --> 12:05.832
I watched a ton of horny '80s
comedies when I was a kid,

12:05.834 --> 12:08.502
and they're filled with ways
of getting back at mean deans.

12:08.504 --> 12:10.804
So we are gonna throw
the wildest party

12:10.806 --> 12:12.873
- this campus has ever seen.
- No.

12:12.875 --> 12:14.307
Okay, then we'll have
a bikini car wash.

12:14.309 --> 12:15.876
No, no, save your schemes.

12:15.878 --> 12:17.978
I know exactly how to get back
at the dean.

12:17.980 --> 12:20.153
- By arresting him.
- For what?

12:20.251 --> 12:21.617
It seems pretty obvious
that Port did it.

12:21.619 --> 12:22.873
No, no, that makes no sense.

12:22.874 --> 12:23.706
Why would someone
steal something valuable

12:23.708 --> 12:25.278
and then leave it in their desk?

12:25.279 --> 12:26.412
I feel like this is
a veiled shot at me

12:26.414 --> 12:27.848
for leaving the crown in my desk

12:27.849 --> 12:28.815
during the third
Halloween Heist.

12:28.817 --> 12:29.638
- It is.
- Oh.

12:29.640 --> 12:32.402
Allister planted the coin
in Professor Port's desk.

12:32.406 --> 12:34.216
- They're rivals.
- Mm.

12:34.217 --> 12:36.618
Did you see the book Allister
was holding back there?

12:36.620 --> 12:39.348
A biography of Macedonian
general Parmenion.

12:39.349 --> 12:40.481
He was taunting us.

12:40.483 --> 12:41.943
Again, I'm the Hitchcock here.

12:41.945 --> 12:43.591
You're gonna have to
connect the dots for me.

12:43.592 --> 12:46.335
Parmenion was a close advisor
to Alexander the Great.

12:46.337 --> 12:48.370
Alexander suspected
that Parmenion

12:48.372 --> 12:50.739
was trying to supplant him,
so he executed him.

12:50.741 --> 12:52.508
He was getting rid of his rival.

12:52.510 --> 12:55.210
Sir, you cracked it!
You and your big hard brain.

12:55.238 --> 12:56.030
- Hard?
- Yes!

12:56.031 --> 12:57.816
You have the biggest, hardest
brain on Earth,

12:57.818 --> 12:58.797
and I want you to say it.

12:58.799 --> 13:01.524
Say "I am Raymond Holt,
and my brain is rock hard."

13:01.525 --> 13:02.596
A brain shouldn't be hard.

13:02.597 --> 13:04.096
If anything, I'll say,
"I am Raymond Holt,

13:04.098 --> 13:05.765
and my brain is soft and wet."

13:05.767 --> 13:07.567
No, don't say that.
It's gross and I hate it.

13:07.569 --> 13:09.435
All right, let's go do
some cop stuff.

13:10.531 --> 13:13.132
Wait, why does Terry's team
have four wins?

13:13.134 --> 13:15.968
He only won steaks, bowling,
and the mobile escape room.

13:15.970 --> 13:17.736
You're forgetting
about our breakfast

13:17.738 --> 13:18.971
at the Empire State Building.

13:18.973 --> 13:20.560
It was so cold up there.

13:20.568 --> 13:23.002
It sounds a lot better than
our indoor skydiving lunch.

13:23.004 --> 13:25.338
Speaking of which, are we gonna
get reimbursed for that?

13:25.340 --> 13:27.906
How dare you complain
about the Funtastic FlyZone.

13:27.907 --> 13:29.840
That was funtastic fun
for everyone.

13:29.842 --> 13:31.509
So what are you guys planning
for today?

13:31.511 --> 13:32.810
Oh, nothing much.

13:32.812 --> 13:33.911
We're just gonna keep it
"caszh."

13:33.913 --> 13:35.980
Us too. Super "caszh."

13:35.982 --> 13:38.416
Super duper "caszh."

13:38.418 --> 13:40.351
We all know you're both planning

13:40.353 --> 13:42.820
something insanely complicated
and annoying.

13:42.822 --> 13:45.556
Your teammates
are turning against you, Terry.

13:45.558 --> 13:47.358
- I'm on your team.
- Who cares?

13:47.360 --> 13:50.605
We're gonna win.
Team Lunch-a-Bunch forever.

13:50.697 --> 13:52.597
Sir, why are we still
doing this?

13:52.599 --> 13:53.898
We've been following him
for days,

13:53.900 --> 13:55.499
and he hasn't done
anything suspicious.

13:55.501 --> 13:56.537
Let's just confront him.

13:56.538 --> 13:59.370
He only hid one of the stolen
coins in Port's desk.

13:59.371 --> 14:00.934
He'll probably try to sell
the others.

14:00.935 --> 14:01.840
I want to catch him in the act.

14:01.845 --> 14:02.873
Shh. Here he comes.

14:08.518 --> 14:11.169
These college kids.
I used to wear long-sleeve T-shirts

14:11.170 --> 14:12.692
under my short-sleeve T-shirts.

14:12.694 --> 14:13.793
Wait a minute, I still could.

14:13.795 --> 14:14.827
Hang on.
He's stopping.

14:14.829 --> 14:15.778
Oh, no, he forgot his phone.

14:15.779 --> 14:18.213
He's gonna turn around and see us.
Come on.

14:18.215 --> 14:20.128
- Sorry, sorry.
- Oh, hey, guys, what's up?

14:20.129 --> 14:21.960
You want to join
our a cappella jam circle?

14:21.962 --> 14:22.506
Oh, no.

14:22.508 --> 14:23.517
Are you guys Harry Potter fans?

14:23.544 --> 14:24.725
I do not like
where this is going.

14:24.726 --> 14:25.432
Three, four.

14:25.932 --> 14:29.691
<i>♪ Won't you
come visit Hogwarts? ♪</i>

14:29.692 --> 14:33.928
<i>♪ I'll be alone,
dancing in Gryffindor ♪</i>

14:33.930 --> 14:38.466
<i>♪ Harry is the best
at the spells ♪</i>

14:38.468 --> 14:41.669
<i>♪ And as for potions,
Hermione does well ♪</i>

14:41.671 --> 14:42.837
This is actually pretty funny.

14:42.839 --> 14:45.339
You got to know Harry Potter.

14:45.341 --> 14:47.039
Wait a minute.
Where'd Allister go?

14:48.311 --> 14:49.510
He was standing right here.

14:49.512 --> 14:51.312
It's like he vanished
without a trace.

14:51.314 --> 14:53.648
Wrong, Peralta.
He vanished with a trace.

14:53.650 --> 14:55.850
Check it out. His footprint.
Gotcha.

14:55.852 --> 14:57.485
I am Raymond Holt
and my brain is rock hard.

14:57.487 --> 14:58.553
- I'm not going to say that.
- Smart.

14:58.555 --> 15:01.384
Saving it for a bigger moment in front
of a bunch of people. Can't wait!

15:01.385 --> 15:03.152
Okay, squad,
hope you ate lunch already,

15:03.154 --> 15:05.387
because it's lunchtime!

15:06.041 --> 15:08.108
- What's with the getups?
- Oh, nothing much.

15:08.110 --> 15:10.977
We just turned the parking garage
into an elaborate paintball arena.

15:10.979 --> 15:13.613
It's zombie-themed.
We hired 60 actors.

15:13.615 --> 15:14.848
That sounds pretty expensive.

15:14.850 --> 15:16.516
Nah, New York actors
are desperate.

15:16.518 --> 15:18.018
For ten bucks, you can
shoot 'em right in the face.

15:18.020 --> 15:19.953
Wow, that's amazing.

15:19.955 --> 15:22.823
I don't know how anybody
could ever beat that...

15:22.825 --> 15:26.159
except maybe an in-office
teppanyaki grill.

15:26.161 --> 15:27.394
Moshi moshi, losers!

15:27.396 --> 15:29.730
We got shrimp.
We got lobster.

15:29.732 --> 15:31.631
Heather, I know you're allergic
to shellfish.

15:31.633 --> 15:33.533
You're just gonna have to
not eat.

15:33.535 --> 15:36.503
Where's Heather?
Where is everybody?

15:36.505 --> 15:38.739
They're on the roof
by Gina's statue.

15:38.741 --> 15:40.907
- What the hell, guys?
- Oh, God, they found us.

15:40.909 --> 15:42.876
- Don't let them take me.
- Why are you hiding from us?

15:42.878 --> 15:45.212
This lunch competition
has gotten out of hand.

15:45.214 --> 15:46.646
No one is having fun.

15:46.648 --> 15:48.011
I keep having panic dreams

15:48.012 --> 15:50.664
about Sergeant Santiago
shooting down my lunch ideas.

15:50.666 --> 15:53.249
Historic walking tours
don't win lunch, Gary.

15:53.250 --> 15:55.584
No one cares about
winning lunch.

15:55.586 --> 15:57.519
Please, just leave us alone.

15:58.856 --> 16:00.255
Gary, wait. Look...

16:00.257 --> 16:01.990
- Oh!
- Ow!

16:01.992 --> 16:02.824
Why did you do that?

16:02.826 --> 16:04.659
Oh, my God, it was an accident.

16:04.661 --> 16:05.994
This thing doesn't have
a safety.

16:05.996 --> 16:07.195
Ow!

16:07.197 --> 16:10.265
Ow, stop!
Help!

16:10.267 --> 16:15.003
And a big round of applause for Janitor
Randy for recovering our precious coin.

16:15.005 --> 16:17.105
Don't applaud for that man.

16:17.107 --> 16:19.207
- What's going on?
- What's going on is,

16:19.209 --> 16:20.976
Captain Holt just solved
this case.

16:20.978 --> 16:22.844
What's there left to solve?
We found the coin

16:22.846 --> 16:24.613
in Professor Port's desk.
He's the thief.

16:24.615 --> 16:25.881
Oh, you'd like everyone
to believe that,

16:25.883 --> 16:27.048
wouldn't you, Dean Allister?

16:27.050 --> 16:29.851
Or should I say,
General Parmenion?

16:29.853 --> 16:31.653
Raymond, are you causing
a kerfuffle?

16:31.655 --> 16:33.855
Yes. Sometimes a moment
calls for a kerfuffle.

16:33.857 --> 16:35.690
No. No moment
calls for a kerfuffle.

16:35.692 --> 16:36.744
You know my feelings on this.

16:36.745 --> 16:40.246
Dean Allister framed Professor
Port to get rid of a rival,

16:40.248 --> 16:42.978
just as Alexander got rid
of Parmenion.

16:42.980 --> 16:45.280
Preposterous. Do you even
have a shred of evidence

16:45.282 --> 16:46.257
to back up that claim?

16:46.258 --> 16:48.468
Oh, we've got more than a shred.
Look at these photos.

16:48.469 --> 16:51.275
Here, a footprint
from the scene of the crime

16:51.276 --> 16:52.223
left by the thief.

16:52.224 --> 16:55.941
And here, another print
made yesterday by you.

16:55.947 --> 16:58.147
- You've been caught, Allister!
- Is it happening?

16:58.149 --> 16:59.648
- Caught by me.
- It is happening.

16:59.650 --> 17:02.818
- Me and my rock hard brain.
- It happened!

17:02.820 --> 17:04.920
Oh, Raymond.
Look around.

17:04.922 --> 17:08.257
These shoes I'm wearing
with their "unique footprint"...

17:08.259 --> 17:11.371
We all have them. They were the
departmental gift this Christmas.

17:11.372 --> 17:12.972
They're actually very funny.

17:12.973 --> 17:14.839
They have Achilles printed
on the heel.

17:14.842 --> 17:16.976
I don't know if I would
call that "very" funny.

17:16.978 --> 17:18.077
I'm surprised you didn't know
about them.

17:18.079 --> 17:19.678
Kevin must have gotten a pair.

17:19.680 --> 17:21.579
Oh, I remember what happened.

17:21.582 --> 17:22.848
You had to leave
the Christmas party

17:22.849 --> 17:24.383
before they were handed out.

17:24.385 --> 17:26.977
Why was that again?
Oh, yes. The kerfuffle.

17:26.978 --> 17:28.845
But what about the
autobiography of Persimminons

17:28.847 --> 17:30.040
you were taunting us with?

17:30.041 --> 17:31.741
I suppose I can see how
holding any book

17:31.743 --> 17:33.309
would seem like a taunt to you.

17:33.311 --> 17:34.177
- I own a book.
- But I don't think Raymond

17:34.179 --> 17:36.145
is remembering
the story correctly.

17:36.147 --> 17:38.548
Alexander didn't see Parmenion
as a rival.

17:38.550 --> 17:40.185
He killed him over a dispute
about his son.

17:40.186 --> 17:42.810
Oh, no, it's Boethius
all over again.

17:42.811 --> 17:44.578
At least you got one thing
right.

17:44.580 --> 17:47.647
You do have a rock hard brain.
Because that's bad.

17:47.649 --> 17:50.016
Everyone knows that a brain
should be soft and wet.

17:50.018 --> 17:51.985
I wanted to say that,
but Jake told me not to.

17:51.987 --> 17:55.088
Yeah, because it's gross.

17:56.528 --> 17:57.620
Thre you are.

17:59.684 --> 18:01.034
- You okay, sir?
- I'm fine.

18:01.057 --> 18:02.723
I have decided
to stop fighting it

18:02.725 --> 18:04.258
and lean in to the fact
that I'm an idiot.

18:04.632 --> 18:06.031
Look at me,
playing a video game.

18:06.033 --> 18:07.533
- Oh, which one?
- "Times" crossword app.

18:07.733 --> 18:08.524
Not a video game.

18:08.525 --> 18:10.859
It plays a little song
when you solve it,

18:10.861 --> 18:12.327
as if you've just learned
to potty.

18:12.329 --> 18:16.249
Yes, yes, play me my dunce's tune.

18:16.253 --> 18:19.888
Okay, so those guys look down on you.
So what?

18:19.890 --> 18:21.389
I mean, Amy's parents
look down on me.

18:21.391 --> 18:23.258
They talk about me right in
front of my face in Spanish

18:23.260 --> 18:24.395
because they don't think
I'm smart enough

18:24.396 --> 18:27.430
to learn another language,
but I've been taking classes,

18:27.432 --> 18:30.834
and now I can understand all the
hurtful things they've been saying.

18:30.836 --> 18:32.068
And how did that help?

18:32.070 --> 18:33.503
Well, now I know
they think I'm short

18:33.505 --> 18:34.938
and I was able
to do some research

18:34.940 --> 18:36.273
and find that 1940s census

18:36.275 --> 18:37.841
that proves I'm above average
in height.

18:37.843 --> 18:39.175
- For 1940.
- Yeah, I'm taller

18:39.177 --> 18:40.844
than the greatest generation.
It doesn't matter.

18:40.846 --> 18:43.213
The point is, you can use this.

18:43.215 --> 18:46.416
There are benefits
to being underestimated.

18:46.418 --> 18:49.185
My goodness.
You're right.

18:49.187 --> 18:52.188
There are benefits
to being underestimated.

18:52.190 --> 18:53.924
You can get away with anything.

18:53.926 --> 18:56.927
Sir?
Are you going to kill the dean?

18:56.929 --> 18:59.796
No. What if the thief
was someone we dismissed

18:59.798 --> 19:01.364
because they didn't have
a classics background?

19:01.366 --> 19:03.233
Someone who wasn't a professor?

19:03.235 --> 19:04.401
But what about the footprints?

19:04.403 --> 19:05.716
The shoes were only given
to faculty.

19:05.718 --> 19:08.178
There was one pair that was
unaccounted for: Kevin's.

19:08.179 --> 19:09.879
They were left at the party...

19:09.881 --> 19:11.347
to be cleaned up.

19:11.349 --> 19:12.915
By Janitor Randy!

19:12.917 --> 19:15.184
My story solved it.
I'm tall.

19:15.186 --> 19:18.087
Hey, everyone, we would like
to say we're sorry

19:18.089 --> 19:20.189
for letting this competition
get the best of us,

19:20.191 --> 19:21.791
and to make it up to you,

19:21.793 --> 19:23.025
we figured out what to do
for lunch.

19:23.027 --> 19:24.260
Please, whatever
your new idea is,

19:24.262 --> 19:25.795
I just don't want
to get shot again.

19:25.797 --> 19:27.964
Ugh, Gary, it was
a paintball. Suck it up.

19:27.966 --> 19:29.599
Isn't this supposed to be
an apology?

19:29.601 --> 19:32.568
Yes. You're right.
I'm sorry.

19:32.570 --> 19:34.737
I mean, I shot my husband with
a real bullet two years ago,

19:34.739 --> 19:35.738
and it comes up way less
than this.

19:35.740 --> 19:36.739
Way less than this.

19:36.741 --> 19:37.936
- Guys!
- Right.

19:37.937 --> 19:40.981
What we're trying to say is
that we lost sight

19:40.984 --> 19:43.784
of what this was all
really about: building morale.

19:43.786 --> 19:45.953
So we bought two-ply toilet
paper for the whole squad.

19:45.955 --> 19:47.421
- I call shotgun!
- Shotgun!

19:47.423 --> 19:50.191
Also, I sold
the teppanyaki grill

19:50.193 --> 19:53.427
and used the money to turn
the briefing room into...

19:53.429 --> 19:54.894
the lunch zone.

19:54.895 --> 19:56.124
Oh, no.
What's the lunch zone?

19:56.125 --> 19:59.042
Is it someplace we have to put
on a harness and not eat lunch?

19:59.043 --> 20:01.377
There are no harnesses.

20:01.379 --> 20:04.881
There are phone chargers
and noise-canceling headphones.

20:04.883 --> 20:07.283
So you can eat your lunch
and stare at your phone

20:07.285 --> 20:09.919
and you won't have to see
or hear anyone you work with.

20:09.921 --> 20:12.722
It's perfect.
It's... it's absolutely perfect.

20:12.724 --> 20:13.971
We're so glad you like it.

20:13.972 --> 20:16.206
And just to be sure,
I'm not gonna get shot.

20:16.208 --> 20:18.975
Oh, my God, Gary.
Yes! You won't get shot!

20:20.027 --> 20:21.626
Yeah, I stole those coins.

20:21.628 --> 20:22.954
Can't believe you bought
that whole story.

20:22.955 --> 20:24.788
They underestimated you, Randy,

20:24.790 --> 20:26.690
just as they underestimated
Raymond Holt.

20:26.692 --> 20:28.461
Well, you guys haven't been
that great to me either.

20:28.469 --> 20:29.497
Well, you got to teach people

20:29.498 --> 20:31.630
how you want to be treated,
Randy. Dr. Phil, RIP.

20:31.631 --> 20:34.862
The point is, Captain Holt solved
the case when no one else could.

20:34.863 --> 20:36.896
He's actually been stealing
from these archives for years.

20:36.898 --> 20:38.611
You've been asleep
at the wheel, Allister.

20:38.612 --> 20:40.008
- You're an embarrassment.
- Really?

20:40.010 --> 20:42.798
Well, at least I've never confused
St. Augustine with Boethius.

20:42.800 --> 20:45.905
Oh, who gives a rat's ass
about Boethius, Wesley?

20:45.906 --> 20:46.782
What are you doing, Kevin?

20:46.785 --> 20:48.718
- I am creating a kerfuffle.
- Oh, damn.

20:48.720 --> 20:51.170
Sure, my husband is
a hot piece of ass,

20:51.172 --> 20:52.938
but he is so much more
than just that.

20:52.940 --> 20:55.608
Raymond Holt is as smart
as anyone in this department,

20:55.610 --> 20:57.476
but he chooses
to use his intelligence

20:57.478 --> 21:00.946
to make our city a better place.

21:00.948 --> 21:04.016
One day, I hope to live up to
the standard you set.

21:04.018 --> 21:07.219
You make me want to have
a wetter brain.

21:07.221 --> 21:09.255
Oh, Kevin.

21:11.626 --> 21:13.325
Y'all are hella specific.
