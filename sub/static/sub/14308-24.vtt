WEBVTT

00:09.267 --> 00:11.267
- YOU GOING DOWN,
BABY PANDA.

00:11.300 --> 00:13.700
I'M GONNA MESS YOU UP, SON.

00:16.200 --> 00:18.167
OOF!

00:18.200 --> 00:19.400
- KNOCKOUT.

00:19.433 --> 00:22.600
- I'M A BAD BEAR.

00:24.300 --> 00:26.700
- HEY, BRO,
NOTICE ANYTHING NEW?

00:26.733 --> 00:28.100
- LET'S SEE...

00:28.133 --> 00:30.300
BOW TIE, SMILING,
ANNOYING.

00:30.333 --> 00:32.233
NOPE.

00:32.267 --> 00:34.100
- I'M TALKING
ABOUT MY SWEET NEW KICKS.

00:34.133 --> 00:37.433
IT'S LIKE MY TOES ARE HAVING
A HIP, HAPPENING PARTY.

00:37.467 --> 00:39.900
- NOT BAD, BUT NOT AS COOL
AS MINE.

00:42.333 --> 00:45.167
ON THE WEB?

00:45.200 --> 00:48.133
- WHERE'D YOU GET YOURS,

00:48.167 --> 00:49.533
A STUPID...

00:49.567 --> 00:51.300
SHOE STORE?

00:53.533 --> 00:56.200
- DON'T SPEAK TO ME.
I DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT.

00:56.233 --> 00:58.167
- OKAY.
HEY, CHECK OUT MY NEW--

00:58.200 --> 00:59.433
- SO THE THREE CHADS
ARE AT THE MALL TODAY

00:59.467 --> 01:00.833
PROMOTING THEIR NEW CD,

01:00.867 --> 01:03.167
OH, OH, OH, OH, OH, OH.
OUR NEW CD.

01:03.200 --> 01:04.700
ALL MY FRIENDS ARE GOING,
BUT I CAN'T

01:04.733 --> 01:06.867
'CAUSE I HAVE TO WRITE A REPORT
ON SOME DUMB VIKING.

01:06.900 --> 01:08.733
- I KNOW.

01:08.767 --> 01:10.300
MY LIFE IS SO UNFAIR.

01:10.333 --> 01:13.267
- THAT...

01:13.300 --> 01:15.500
WAS FOR WHAT YOU SAID
ABOUT VIKINGS.

01:15.533 --> 01:17.100
THEY'RE NOT DUMB.

01:17.133 --> 01:19.100
THEY WERE
INTREPID EXPLORERS...

01:19.133 --> 01:21.867
WITH THE OCCASIONAL ACT
OF UNBRIDLED SAVAGERY.

01:21.900 --> 01:23.733
- GREAT, DO YOU THINK
THAT'S ENOUGH TO TURN IN?

01:23.767 --> 01:25.600
MAYBE IF I DOUBLE-SPACE IT.

01:28.333 --> 01:30.633
AH, LEIF ERIKSON,

01:30.667 --> 01:32.633
THE NOBLEST VIKING
TO SAIL THE NORTH ATLANTIC.

01:32.667 --> 01:34.400
I ACTUALLY MET LEIF
IN GHOST WORLD.

01:34.433 --> 01:37.633
COOL GUY.
LOVES ICE-BLENDED MOCHAS.

01:37.667 --> 01:40.867
NEVER PAYS.

01:40.900 --> 01:42.400
- WAIT, MILES, THAT'S IT.

01:42.433 --> 01:44.400
YOU GO GET LEIF
AND BRING HIM BACK HERE.

01:44.433 --> 01:45.700
HE CAN YAMMER ON
ABOUT VIKING STUFF

01:45.733 --> 01:47.267
AND SAVE ME
HOURS OF READING.

01:47.300 --> 01:48.867
I'LL BE AT THE MALL
IN NO TIME.

01:48.900 --> 01:52.267
- I WEEP FOR THE FUTURE
OF AMERICA.

01:53.733 --> 01:55.700
- LOOK, YOU CAN'T
TAKE ACADEMIC SHORTCUTS.

01:55.733 --> 01:58.833
THAT WOULD ROB YOU OF A VALUABLE
LEARNING EXPERIENCE.

01:58.867 --> 02:01.533
GOOD ONE, MILES.

02:01.567 --> 02:03.267
OH, YOU'RE SERIOUS.

02:03.300 --> 02:05.633
- BESIDES, I'VE GOTTA
GET READY FOR A BIG DATE.

02:05.667 --> 02:08.600
GOOD ONE, MILES.

02:08.633 --> 02:10.733
OH, YOU'RE SERIOUS.

02:12.400 --> 02:14.433
GOOD, BECAUSE I HAVE
SOME GHOST IRONING TO DO.

02:14.467 --> 02:17.533
AND YES!
I'M SERIOUS.

02:24.200 --> 02:26.567
- SO, A LITTLE BIRDIE
TOLD ME

02:26.600 --> 02:29.500
YOU'RE IN A BIT
OF A PICKLE.

02:29.533 --> 02:31.867
- I'D DO ANYTHING
TO GET THAT VIKING HERE.

02:31.900 --> 02:34.233
- TOO BAD THERE ISN'T
A TOP-NOTCH SUPER GHOST

02:34.267 --> 02:37.100
WITH BOYISH GOOD LOOKS
WHO COULD MAKE THAT VIKING

02:37.133 --> 02:39.300
APPEAR FOR YA.

02:39.333 --> 02:42.367
- YEAH, BUT RAY
WOULD NEVER DO IT.

02:42.400 --> 02:43.867
- OH, SHE DID NOT
JUST DIS ME.

02:43.900 --> 02:45.733
I DEMAND RESPECT!

02:45.767 --> 02:47.400
RESPECT, I SAY!

02:53.300 --> 02:55.800
- * IF YOU MOVE
INTO A HAUNTED HOUSE *

02:55.833 --> 02:58.467
* YOU GOTTA TRY
TO WORK THINGS OUT *

02:58.500 --> 03:00.833
- * SO IF YOU'RE LIVING
WITH A GHOST OR THREE *

03:00.867 --> 03:04.667
- * YOU GOTTA BE
ONE BIG, SEMI-SCARY FAMILY *

03:04.700 --> 03:07.167
- * DON'T KNOW
HOW WE ENDED UP THIS WAY *

03:07.200 --> 03:08.367
- * BUT I GUESS
YOU COULD CALL US *

03:08.400 --> 03:11.433
- * THE HAUNTED HATHAWAYS

03:11.467 --> 03:14.167
* THE HAUNTED HATHAWAYS

03:14.200 --> 03:16.533
- * THE HAUNTED HATHAWAYS

03:16.567 --> 03:19.800
*

03:19.833 --> 03:22.333
- * THE HAUNTED HATHAWAYS

03:22.367 --> 03:24.333
*

03:27.933 --> 03:30.167
- WHATEVER THIS IS,
I DON'T HAVE TIME TO--

03:30.200 --> 03:32.300
- SIT.

03:32.333 --> 03:34.567
WHEN I SUGGESTED YOU GET HELP
FROM A TOP-NOTCH GHOST,

03:34.600 --> 03:36.367
I MEANT ME.

03:36.400 --> 03:38.567
SO EITHER I DIDN'T GIVE YOU
ENOUGH CLUES,

03:38.600 --> 03:41.067
OR YOU DON'T THINK
I'M CAPABLE.

03:41.100 --> 03:44.267
WHOA!

03:44.300 --> 03:47.067
- I'M LEANING
TOWARDS NUMBER TWO.

03:47.100 --> 03:48.833
- IT'S AN OUTRAGE.

03:48.867 --> 03:51.067
WHENEVER SOMEONE IN THIS HOUSE
HAS A PROBLEM,

03:51.100 --> 03:53.533
THEY CALL ON
MY DAD OR MILES.

03:53.567 --> 03:54.800
- DO YOU NEED HELP
GETTING UP?

03:54.833 --> 03:59.067
SHOULD I CALL YOUR DAD
OR MILES?

03:59.100 --> 04:00.400
- I'M FINE.

04:00.433 --> 04:02.133
LOUIE PRESTON IS A GHOST

04:02.167 --> 04:04.833
WHO CAN GET THE JOB DONE.

04:04.867 --> 04:06.300
NOW WAIT HERE,
AND I'LL GO TO GHOST WORLD

04:06.333 --> 04:08.633
AND BE BACK WITH...

04:08.667 --> 04:10.233
UM...

04:10.267 --> 04:11.867
UH...DON'T TELL ME.

04:11.900 --> 04:14.467
- LEIF.
LEIF ERIKSON.

04:14.500 --> 04:17.233
- OOH--NO, THAT'S NOT IT.

04:17.267 --> 04:19.767
- LOUIE.
- ALL RIGHT, CALM DOWN.

04:19.800 --> 04:22.800
I GOT THIS.
OFF I GO.

04:25.933 --> 04:27.467
HAPPENS SOMETIMES.

04:27.500 --> 04:29.133
I THINK THIS PORTAL
HAS A FAULTY--

04:35.633 --> 04:38.500
- YOU'RE OPENING THE CUSTOMER
COMMENT BOX ALREADY?

04:38.533 --> 04:39.700
- IT'S BEEN A WEEK
SINCE I PUT IT OUT.

04:39.733 --> 04:41.133
WHY WOULDN'T I?
AAH!

04:41.167 --> 04:42.800
SOMEONE ELSE DO IT.
NO, I WILL.

04:42.833 --> 04:46.400
I CAN'T. I MUST.
AAH! NO.

04:46.433 --> 04:48.333
- THAT'S WHY.

04:48.367 --> 04:51.100
- I'M GOING IN.

04:51.133 --> 04:52.333
WHAT DOES IT SAY?

04:52.367 --> 04:54.067
DO THEY LIKE ME?

04:54.100 --> 04:56.733
- "YUMMY PASTRIES.
NICE DECOR."

04:56.767 --> 04:59.367
- LOVE MY CUSTOMERS.
THEY ARE SO KIND.

04:59.400 --> 05:01.867
- "BUT THE OWNER SEEMS
SLIGHTLY OUT OF HER GOURD."

05:01.900 --> 05:04.300
- LIARS!

05:04.333 --> 05:07.267
THEY ARE KIND.

05:07.300 --> 05:09.867
- GIVE ME THE BOX.

05:09.900 --> 05:12.700
OH! "CRAZY EYES"?

05:12.733 --> 05:16.600
CLEARLY, SOMEONE DOESN'T KNOW
WHAT HARD WORK LOOKS LIKE.

05:18.433 --> 05:21.133
LOOK HOW THIS GUY SPELLED
"NERVOUS BREAKDOWN."

05:21.167 --> 05:24.567
JOKE'S ON HIM, AM I RIGHT?

05:24.600 --> 05:26.667
- AND THIS IS JUST
A THERAPIST'S CARD.

05:26.700 --> 05:28.600
WE'LL HOLD ONTO THAT ONE.

05:28.633 --> 05:29.833
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

05:29.867 --> 05:32.367
- NOT TO CALL DR. SHELTON.

05:32.400 --> 05:34.700
THAT'S FOR SURE.

05:34.733 --> 05:37.400
- IT'S PROBABLY JUST SOME
TEENAGERS FOOLING AROUND.

05:37.433 --> 05:38.633
- EXACTLY.

05:38.667 --> 05:40.667
AND, ON A TOTALLY
DIFFERENT SUBJECT,

05:40.700 --> 05:43.400
I HAVE SOME GREAT RELAXATION
TAPES YOU CAN BORROW.

05:43.433 --> 05:47.667
OR KEEP.

05:47.700 --> 05:50.067
IT'S THE DR. VICKIE SERIES,

05:50.100 --> 05:53.733
FIND YOUR INNER BUTTERFLY.

05:53.767 --> 05:56.300
- YOU FOUND
YOUR INNER BUTTERFLY?

05:56.333 --> 05:58.533
- MORE LIKE
MY INNER SUPERFLY.

05:58.567 --> 06:01.600
YOU KNOW, 'CAUSE THAT'S ME.

06:01.633 --> 06:04.567
- HEY, CHECK OUT THE FLOWERS.

06:04.600 --> 06:06.633
MY DATE, MIRABELLE,
WILL BE HERE ANY MINUTE.

06:06.667 --> 06:08.533
- OH, MILES, HOW SWEET.

06:08.567 --> 06:09.900
I CAN'T REMEMBER
THE LAST TIME

06:09.933 --> 06:12.333
SOMEONE GAVE ME FLOWERS,
OR CANDY,

06:12.367 --> 06:16.467
OR JUST A COMMENT
REGARDING A JOB WELL DONE!

06:19.400 --> 06:20.600
I AM BUT A BUTTERFLY.

06:20.633 --> 06:24.467
FLY, BUTTERFLY, FLY.

06:24.500 --> 06:27.533
- SO, TELL ME
ABOUT THIS MIRABELLE.

06:27.567 --> 06:28.800
- SHE'S THE GHOST GIRL YOU MET

06:28.833 --> 06:30.567
AT MY SUNSCREEN AWARENESS
RALLY.

06:30.600 --> 06:33.833
- OH, YEAH, RIGHT!
THAT WAS...

06:33.867 --> 06:35.433
FUN.

06:35.467 --> 06:36.833
OH, WAIT.

06:36.867 --> 06:38.367
MIRABELLE.

06:38.400 --> 06:41.267
I REMEMBER.
SHE WAS REALLY CUTE.

06:41.300 --> 06:45.400
THAT'S MY BOY.

06:45.433 --> 06:47.167
- HOLY WARDROBE MISHAP!

06:47.200 --> 06:51.433
I'M NOT WEARING
MY LAVENDER BOW TIE!

06:51.467 --> 06:54.833
- YEP.
THAT'S MY BOY.

06:56.833 --> 06:58.667
- EMMA, GUESS WHO'S
GONNA FINISH HER PAPER

06:58.700 --> 07:00.600
IN TIME TO JOIN YOU GUYS
AT THE MALL

07:00.633 --> 07:03.167
TO SEE THE THREE CHADS.

07:03.200 --> 07:06.200
NO. NO.

07:06.233 --> 07:09.833
NO, STOP GUESSING.
IT'S ME.

07:09.867 --> 07:13.767
TAYLOR.

07:13.800 --> 07:15.167
LOUIE, DID YOU GET HIM?

07:15.200 --> 07:16.533
OF COURSE I DID.

07:16.567 --> 07:19.400
LOUIE PRESTON
ALWAYS GETS HIS GHOST.

07:19.433 --> 07:24.600
PRESENTING THE MOST NOBLE VIKING
IN HISTORY!

07:27.867 --> 07:29.233
MM.

07:34.333 --> 07:37.333
- HORACE THE HORRIBLE.
- I SAID LEIF ERIKSON!

07:37.367 --> 07:39.367
- I'M PRETTY SURE YOU SAID
HORACE THE HORRIBLE,

07:39.400 --> 07:43.600
AND I DON'T MAKE MISTAKES,
SO--

07:43.633 --> 07:48.133
- AFTER-DINNER MINT.

07:48.167 --> 07:50.767
- FINE, I'LL JUST HAVE TO MAKE
THIS WORK.

07:50.800 --> 07:53.267
UH, HORACE, IF I COULD ASK YOU
A FEW QUESTIONS--

07:58.433 --> 08:00.333
- WOW.

08:00.367 --> 08:04.767
SO SOAP, I'M GUESSING,
NOT AVAILABLE IN VIKING TIMES?

08:04.800 --> 08:06.533
ANYWAY, QUESTION ONE:

08:06.567 --> 08:08.567
WHAT'S THE BEST PART
ABOUT BEING A VIKING?

08:13.733 --> 08:15.667
- I DO NOT KNOW
HOW TO SPELL THAT.

08:15.700 --> 08:18.267
- OOH!
SHINY OBJECT.

08:24.700 --> 08:26.433
- LOUIE, YOU'VE GOT
TO GET HIM OUT OF HERE.

08:26.467 --> 08:29.200
I'LL GO FIND RAY.
- NO! I'LL FIX THIS.

08:29.233 --> 08:30.667
HORACE, SWEETHEART.

08:30.700 --> 08:33.867
WALK WITH ME, TALK WITH ME.

08:33.900 --> 08:35.767
- HORACE CLAIM THIS LAND
TO BE NEW HOME.

08:35.800 --> 08:37.333
CALL IT...

08:37.367 --> 08:39.200
HORACE-LANDIA!

08:39.233 --> 08:41.633
NOW, ME PLUNDER.

08:47.633 --> 08:49.233
- MAN, HE'S A LITTLE PRICKLY.

08:56.633 --> 08:59.633
- YES!
ANOTHER MOUTH-IN-ONE.

09:02.167 --> 09:04.333
EXCUSE ME--

09:04.367 --> 09:06.667
- GOLF VOICE, PLEASE.
I'M PUTTING.

09:06.700 --> 09:08.567
- I'M HERE TO SEE MILES.

09:08.600 --> 09:10.733
WOW, THERE ARE A LOT
OF FLOWERS IN HERE.

09:10.767 --> 09:13.200
- UGH.
YEP, THAT'S MILES.

09:13.233 --> 09:15.400
WHAT CAN YOU SAY?
THE KID'S A LITTLE DIFFERENT.

09:15.433 --> 09:17.200
UH, WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

09:17.233 --> 09:20.300
- YOU KNOW, HE'S A GUY
WHO ACTUALLY LIKES SOCK PUPPETS.

09:20.333 --> 09:21.833
VERY ODD, AM I RIGHT?

09:21.867 --> 09:24.533
- ARE YOU PUTTING GOLF BALLS
INTO A MANNEQUIN HEAD?

09:24.567 --> 09:29.267
- WELL, SOMEONE'S
A LITTLE JUDGEY.

09:29.300 --> 09:32.133
WE'VE GOTTEN PRETTY USED
TO MILES'S QUIRKS, THOUGH.

09:32.167 --> 09:34.300
- LIKE SETTING AN EXTRA PLACE

09:34.333 --> 09:35.867
AT THE DINNER TABLE
FOR HIS FRIEND, MOPPY,

09:35.900 --> 09:37.633
WHO, YES, IS A MOP.

09:37.667 --> 09:40.400
AND THEN, OF COURSE,
THERE'S HIS LOVE OF LAVENDER.

09:40.433 --> 09:44.267
- YEAH, HE CLEARLY
LOVES LAVENDER.

09:44.300 --> 09:47.300
I THINK I MADE A MISTAKE.

09:48.733 --> 09:49.900
- HEY, FRANKENBERRY.

09:49.933 --> 09:51.733
WHAT DO YOU THINK
OF THE FLOWERS?

09:51.767 --> 09:54.300
I'M TRYING TO IMPRESS A GIRL
WHO'S ON HER WAY OVER.

09:54.333 --> 09:55.767
- OH...

09:55.800 --> 09:57.767
IS SHE A QUIET,
CURLY-HAIRED,

09:57.800 --> 09:59.533
SHOWS-UP-EARLY
KIND OF GIRL?

09:59.567 --> 10:01.367
YEAH, HOW'D YOU KNOW?

10:01.400 --> 10:04.700
- JUST A GUESS.

10:04.733 --> 10:06.133
- HER NAME'S MIRABELLE.

10:06.167 --> 10:07.333
I WANT EVERYTHING
TO BE PERFECT

10:07.367 --> 10:09.133
FOR WHEN SHE GETS HERE.

10:09.167 --> 10:10.767
THEY SAY A GIRL CAN MAKE UP
HER MIND IF SHE LIKES YOU OR NOT

10:10.800 --> 10:13.167
IN THE FIRST FIVE MINUTES
OF A DATE.

10:13.200 --> 10:16.400
- SOMETIMES LESS.

10:17.733 --> 10:18.900
THIS BOW TIE'S
TOO MATCHY-MATCHY.

10:18.933 --> 10:20.300
BE RIGHT BACK.

10:20.333 --> 10:22.333
OH, HEY,
IF SHE SHOWS UP...

10:22.367 --> 10:24.833
TALK UP HOW COOL I AM.

10:26.733 --> 10:29.533
- ALWAYS DO.

10:29.567 --> 10:32.167
- RAY, I NEED YOUR HELP.

10:32.200 --> 10:33.867
I THINK I MESSED UP.

10:33.900 --> 10:36.333
- BROKE A VASE MESSED UP

10:36.367 --> 10:39.233
OR THE COPS'LL BE HERE
ANY MINUTE MESSED UP?

10:39.267 --> 10:40.667
- IT'S ABOUT MILES.

10:40.700 --> 10:43.400
I MAY HAVE ACCIDENTALLY
CHASED HIS DATE AWAY.

10:44.767 --> 10:47.567
- I WAS JUST TELLING HER
SOME STUFF ABOUT MILES.

10:47.600 --> 10:49.767
NEXT THING YOU KNOW,
SHE LEFT.

10:49.800 --> 10:52.500
- FRANKIE!
MILES IS GONNA BE CRUSHED.

10:52.533 --> 10:55.133
- MAYBE HE DOESN'T EVEN
LIKE HER THAT MUCH.

10:55.167 --> 10:56.400
- * SHA-DEEP DOO-BOP

10:56.433 --> 10:58.200
* FEELING SWELL

10:58.233 --> 10:59.400
* SHA-DEEP DOO-BOP

10:59.433 --> 11:01.233
* MIRABELLE!

11:01.267 --> 11:03.333
- OKAY, HE DOES.

11:03.367 --> 11:04.833
WHAT DO WE DO, RAY?

11:04.867 --> 11:06.367
YAH!

11:06.400 --> 11:08.700
CALM DOWN. IT'S ME.

11:08.733 --> 11:11.133
- IT JUST GOT VERY WEIRD
IN HERE.

11:11.167 --> 11:13.667
- I MET THIS GIRL
AT MILES'S EVENT.

11:13.700 --> 11:14.867
THIS IS HOW SHE SOUNDS

11:14.900 --> 11:16.367
AND LOOKS.

11:16.400 --> 11:19.133
- OH.
NOW IT'S COMPLETELY NORMAL.

11:19.167 --> 11:20.800
- * DO DO-BOP

11:20.833 --> 11:24.133
OH, MIRABELLE!
SO GLAD YOU'RE HERE.

11:24.167 --> 11:25.533
YEAH.

11:25.567 --> 11:26.833
OW.

11:26.867 --> 11:28.500
WHOA.

11:28.533 --> 11:29.900
YOU'RE STRONG.

11:29.933 --> 11:31.700
- WHAT'S STRONG
IS YOUR CHOICE OF BOW TIE.

11:31.733 --> 11:33.367
- OH.

11:33.400 --> 11:36.400
- DIAL IT DOWN, MIRABELLE.

11:39.400 --> 11:40.800
- WE HAVE TO GET
THAT BARBARIAN

11:40.833 --> 11:42.667
OUT OF HERE
BEFORE MY MOM SEES HIM.

11:44.100 --> 11:46.233
HAVE I LET YOU DOWN YET?

11:46.267 --> 11:47.433
DON'T ANSWER THAT.

11:48.667 --> 11:50.733
- YOU ON HORACE LAND!

11:50.767 --> 11:54.533
WELCOME.
TUESDAY BINGO NIGHT.

11:54.567 --> 11:58.467
- LOUIE, PLEASE TELL HIM
TO STOP CONQUERING ROOMS.

11:58.500 --> 11:59.667
- LET'S GO, BUDDY.

11:59.700 --> 12:03.133
BACK TO GHOST WORLD.

12:03.167 --> 12:04.633
NOBODY BOSS HORACE.

12:04.667 --> 12:08.267
- NOT COOL, HORACE.
NOT COOL.

12:08.300 --> 12:10.233
- LOUIE,
WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO?

12:10.267 --> 12:12.500
IF MOM FINDS OUT,
SHE'LL GROUND ME FOR LIFE.

12:12.533 --> 12:15.233
- ALL WE HAVE TO DO
IS KEEP HIM AWAY FROM HER

12:15.267 --> 12:17.200
TILL I FIGURE OUT
HOW TO KICK HIS VIKING BUTT

12:17.233 --> 12:18.767
BACK TO GHOST WORLD.

12:18.800 --> 12:22.200
- HORACE SMELL TASTY TREATS.

12:22.233 --> 12:24.700
TIME TO GET MY PILLAGE ON!

12:30.667 --> 12:32.600
- TO RUTHLESSLY DESTROY.

12:46.467 --> 12:50.167
- OH.
THIS IS PILLAGING.

12:50.200 --> 12:52.233
- OH, MAN,
MOM'S GONNA GO BERSERK.

12:52.267 --> 12:55.133
- EVERY DAY,
IN EVERY WAY,

12:55.167 --> 12:58.167
I'M GETTING BETTER
AND BETTER.

13:01.467 --> 13:03.200
- LOUIE, DO SOMETHING.

13:03.233 --> 13:04.533
- ONE SNAP,
AND I'LL HAVE THIS PLACE

13:04.567 --> 13:06.567
LOOKING GOOD AS NEW.

13:09.667 --> 13:11.533
- WELL, AT LEAST WE'RE READY
FOR CHRISTMAS...

13:11.567 --> 13:13.200
NINE MONTHS EARLY.

13:13.233 --> 13:15.233
- HEY, TAY, DO YOU HAVE--OH!

13:15.267 --> 13:17.667
OW.

13:20.533 --> 13:22.133
- DR. VICKIE
SAYS THE DOOR OF LIFE

13:22.167 --> 13:23.500
SWINGS BOTH WAYS--

13:23.533 --> 13:24.867
ALTHOUGH SHE FAILED
TO MENTION THE PART

13:24.900 --> 13:27.200
ABOUT IT SWINGING
INTO MY HEAD.

13:27.233 --> 13:29.100
- YEAH, SORRY ABOUT THAT.

13:30.367 --> 13:32.767
- NOT MY REINDEER ORNAMENTS!

13:32.800 --> 13:34.533
- THERE'S--
- MOM!

13:34.567 --> 13:36.367
UH, SHOW ME
HOW THESE MEDITATIONS WORK.

13:36.400 --> 13:37.833
BEING A TEEN TODAY
IS A LOT OF PRESSURE

13:37.867 --> 13:39.233
AND I COULD USE SOME TIPS.

13:39.267 --> 13:40.700
- OH, ABSOLUTELY, SWEETIE.

13:40.733 --> 13:44.467
FIRST, WE CLOSE OUR EYES
AND OPEN OUR SOULS.

13:44.500 --> 13:47.667
OHMMM...

13:52.600 --> 13:55.267
- LOUIE, GET OUT OF HERE!

13:55.300 --> 13:56.867
- PEACE COMES FROM WITHIN,

13:56.900 --> 14:00.800
A SUN THAT NEVER SETS,
BRINGING ORDER AND TRANQUILITY

14:00.833 --> 14:02.200
TO OUR LIVES.

14:02.233 --> 14:05.300
OH, SO TRUE, DR. VICKIE.
SO TRUE.

14:05.333 --> 14:08.200
ALL AROUND ME IS PEACE.

14:08.233 --> 14:12.200
I FLOAT ON A CLOUD
OF SERENITY.

14:12.233 --> 14:15.633
OHMMM...

14:21.633 --> 14:24.433
- AND THAT'S HOW YOU DO
A 17-MINUTE SAXOPHONE SOLO.

14:25.667 --> 14:28.167
- UH, MIRABELLE,
ARE YOU OKAY?

14:28.200 --> 14:31.400
YOU DON'T SEEM
YOURSELF TODAY.

14:31.433 --> 14:33.767
AND WHAT HAPPENED
TO ALL MY FLOWERS?

14:33.800 --> 14:36.733
- THEY WERE A LITTLE MUCH.

14:36.767 --> 14:39.400
DEFINITELY.

14:39.433 --> 14:41.233
UM--AHEM.

14:41.267 --> 14:45.200
I MEAN, I LIKED THEM.

14:45.233 --> 14:48.100
- OH, BROTHER.

14:48.133 --> 14:50.333
HEY, MILES,
YOU KNOW WHAT'D BE FUN?

14:50.367 --> 14:52.867
IF YOU SHOWED MIRABELLE
YOUR NEW SUSPENDERS.

14:52.900 --> 14:54.867
- GREAT IDEA!

14:54.900 --> 14:56.800
WHY SAVE THOSE BABIES
FOR FLAG DAY

14:56.833 --> 14:59.367
WHEN I CAN BREAK 'EM
OUT NOW?

15:01.200 --> 15:03.167
- RAY, YOU'RE
A TERRIBLE GIRL.

15:03.200 --> 15:04.733
- I DON'T CARE.

15:04.767 --> 15:07.233
THIS IS BETTER THAN MILES
FINDING OUT HE GOT STOOD UP.

15:07.267 --> 15:09.867
- I KNOW, BUT WHAT DO WE DO
IF HE WANTS A SECOND DATE?

15:09.900 --> 15:12.467
- HMM, THERE'S A NEW
SCI-FI MOVIE

15:12.500 --> 15:15.733
I REALLY WANT TO SEE.

15:15.767 --> 15:20.400
- WE'VE REALLY VEERED
INTO A WEIRD AREA HERE.

15:20.433 --> 15:23.500
WAIT! IF WE MAKE IT
SO MILES DOESN'T LIKE HER,

15:23.533 --> 15:25.200
HE WON'T WANT TO SEE
MIRABELLE AGAIN.

15:25.233 --> 15:27.167
HE NEVER HAS HIS HEART BROKEN,
AND THE ONLY PERSON

15:27.200 --> 15:30.600
I HAVE TO DISCUSS THIS WITH
IS DR. SHELTON.

15:33.533 --> 15:36.667
BUT I'M SO ADORABLE.

15:36.700 --> 15:38.433
- JUST DO IT.
GROSS HIM OUT.

15:38.467 --> 15:40.600
IT'S THE ONLY WAY.

15:40.633 --> 15:45.333
AND GET RID OF YOUR MAN HEAD.
IT'S FREAKING ME OUT.

15:47.167 --> 15:49.100
SUSPENDERS THAT CALL
FOR WORLD UNITY.

15:49.133 --> 15:52.133
NOW, THAT'S A CAUSE
THAT CAN SUPPORT ME.

15:58.600 --> 16:00.167
AH.

16:00.200 --> 16:01.700
- DID YOU JUST--

16:01.733 --> 16:05.533
YEAH-HUH.

16:05.567 --> 16:09.600
- MILES,
THIS ONE'S QUITE A LADY.

16:10.900 --> 16:13.867
- PLEASE SAY HAND SANITIZER.

16:13.900 --> 16:15.867
- LITTERING
AND NOT COMPLIMENTING PEOPLE

16:15.900 --> 16:17.400
ON THEIR NEW HAIRCUTS.

16:18.467 --> 16:20.300
BUT A CHEERY HAIR COMPLIMENT

16:20.333 --> 16:22.800
CAN TURN A PERSON'S DAY
AROUND.

16:22.833 --> 16:24.100
- THIS IS GREAT.

16:24.133 --> 16:25.300
NOW THAT YOU'RE MY BOYFRIEND,

16:25.333 --> 16:26.633
I CAN REALLY RELAX
AND BE MYSELF.

16:28.167 --> 16:30.333
I-I'M NOT REALLY...

16:30.367 --> 16:32.533
READY FOR ANYTHING SERIOUS, SO--

16:32.567 --> 16:34.200
- OH, I FIGURED AS MUCH.

16:34.233 --> 16:35.400
YOU'RE WAY TOO GOOD FOR ME.

16:35.433 --> 16:38.433
WELP, I'LL JUST BE
ON MY WAY.

16:45.167 --> 16:48.167
- OOH, BOY.

16:50.567 --> 16:51.733
- THERE'S GOTTA
BE SOMETHING IN HERE

16:51.767 --> 16:53.233
TO HELP US
GET RID OF HORACE.

16:53.267 --> 16:55.833
- CUSHY BENCH MAKE
GOOD FIREWOOD.

16:58.267 --> 17:00.167
- IT SAYS, "VIKINGS
WERE TERRIFIED OF THOR,

17:00.200 --> 17:02.433
THE GOD OF THUNDER,
WHO WIELDED A GIANT HAMMER."

17:02.467 --> 17:04.333
- YOU ASK.
LOUIE ANSWERS.

17:04.367 --> 17:05.833
ONE THUNDER GOD COMING UP.

17:05.867 --> 17:09.667
- WAIT.

17:09.700 --> 17:13.267
AND THERE IT IS.

17:13.300 --> 17:15.533
- PUNY CLOWN GHOST,
GIVE HORACE PINWHEEL.

17:17.800 --> 17:20.833
- MAYBE YOU SHOULD'VE ASKED
MY DAD OR MILES FOR HELP.

17:20.867 --> 17:24.433
I GUESS I'M NOT THE TOP-NOTCH
GHOST I THOUGHT I WAS.

17:24.467 --> 17:26.767
- OOH, PRETTY.

17:33.567 --> 17:35.533
- SO, WAIT.
MILES, THIS IS YOUR DAD?

17:35.567 --> 17:38.567
'SUP?

17:40.667 --> 17:43.467
- I THINK MIRABELLE AND I
DESERVE AN EXPLANATION.

17:43.500 --> 17:45.100
- LIKE I'M THE FIRST FATHER
WHO'S EVER MORPHED

17:45.133 --> 17:47.467
INTO HIS SON'S DATE.

17:47.500 --> 17:49.800
- I THINK WE'RE THE ONES
WHO DESERVE AN EXPLANATION

17:49.833 --> 17:52.333
FOR MIRABELLE WALKING OUT
ON MILES.

17:52.367 --> 17:53.600
- I DIDN'T WALK OUT.

17:53.633 --> 17:55.167
I WENT HOME TO CHANGE
BECAUSE YOU SAID

17:55.200 --> 17:57.233
MILES LOVES LAVENDER.

17:57.267 --> 17:58.633
I WANTED TO MAKE
A GOOD IMPRESSION

17:58.667 --> 18:02.367
BECAUSE, WELL,
I LIKE HIM.

18:04.767 --> 18:06.867
- I'M GOOD.

18:06.900 --> 18:09.367
ALL GOOD.

18:09.400 --> 18:10.867
- I'M SORRY,
I THOUGHT IT WAS MY REMARKS

18:10.900 --> 18:13.233
ABOUT MILES' BIZARRE LOVE
OF SOCK PUPPETS

18:13.267 --> 18:14.667
THAT MADE YOU LEAVE.

18:14.700 --> 18:17.833
SOCK PUPPETS ROCK THE HARDEST.

18:17.867 --> 18:21.567
- UH-OH, HERE I GO AGAIN.

18:24.800 --> 18:26.500
DO YOU WANT TO GO AND WRITE
A SONG WITH ME

18:26.533 --> 18:27.867
ABOUT THE DANGERS
OF LITTERING?

18:27.900 --> 18:31.400
- DO I!

18:31.433 --> 18:34.433
- I THINK THOSE CRAZY KIDS
ARE GONNA MAKE IT.

18:36.367 --> 18:38.167
- I FINALLY FOUND A PARAGRAPH
ON HORACE,

18:38.200 --> 18:39.467
BUT THERE'S NOT MUCH
TO GO ON.

18:39.500 --> 18:42.867
WASN'T MUCH OF A BATHER.
KNEW THAT.

18:42.900 --> 18:44.600
AFRAID OF HIS MOTHER,
ANNIE THE ANGRY,

18:44.633 --> 18:46.833
AND IT SAYS
HE'S A SKILLED SEAMSTRESS.

18:46.867 --> 18:51.633
- HORACE MAKE SAIL
AND MATCHING VEST.

18:51.667 --> 18:53.633
NEXT MONTH,
GO TO DAYTONA.

18:53.667 --> 18:57.233
SPRING BREAK!

18:57.267 --> 18:59.567
- THOSE ARE MOM'S
FAVORITE DRAPES.

19:01.933 --> 19:03.867
- WERE MOM'S FAVORITE DRAPES.

19:03.900 --> 19:05.533
- AAH!

19:05.567 --> 19:07.167
- OH, HEY, KIDS.

19:07.200 --> 19:08.533
I'VE BEEN OUT WALKING
AROUND THE NEIGHBORHOOD,

19:08.567 --> 19:10.333
GIVING OUT HUGS
TO STRANGERS,

19:10.367 --> 19:12.367
AND IT FELT GREAT!

19:12.400 --> 19:13.833
UNTIL A POLICEMAN
TOLD ME TO STOP.

19:13.867 --> 19:17.200
- MM.
- LAND HO!

19:17.233 --> 19:19.400
WHAT?

19:19.433 --> 19:21.200
OH.

19:21.233 --> 19:23.333
THAT'S HORACE.
HE'S HARMLESS.

19:25.667 --> 19:28.433
HE IS DESTROYING MY BAKERY!

19:28.467 --> 19:30.667
BREATHE, MICHELLE.
YOU OWN YOUR OWN ANGER.

19:30.700 --> 19:33.700
WHY IS THERE
A CHRISTMAS TREE?

19:33.733 --> 19:36.233
- I SORT OF ASKED LOUIE
TO HELP ME

19:36.267 --> 19:37.733
WITH MY HISTORY PAPER.

19:37.767 --> 19:39.567
- AND, ONCE AGAIN,
I BLEW IT.

19:39.600 --> 19:42.400
I'M A CRUMMY GHOST.
GO AHEAD AND FREAK OUT.

19:42.433 --> 19:44.367
- I AM NOT GONNA FREAK OUT.

19:44.400 --> 19:46.367
THIS IS THE UNIVERSE
TESTING ME.

19:46.400 --> 19:50.200
GUIDE ME, DR. VICKIE.
GUIDE ME.

19:54.200 --> 19:56.200
PLEASE ASK YOUR GUEST
TO LEAVE.

19:58.667 --> 20:02.300
- WOW, I WAS EXPECTING MOM
TO HAVE A MELTDOWN.

20:02.333 --> 20:03.700
- WAIT!

20:03.733 --> 20:05.900
YOUR BOOK SAID
THE ONE PERSON HORACE FEARED

20:05.933 --> 20:08.200
WAS HIS MOTHER,
ANNIE THE ANGRY.

20:08.233 --> 20:09.700
WE DON'T HAVE HER,

20:09.733 --> 20:14.200
BUT MAYBE HE'D LISTEN
TO AN ANGRY MICHELLE.

20:14.233 --> 20:16.833
- EXCUSE ME.
EXCUSE ME, YOUNG MAN.

20:16.867 --> 20:18.300
- DON'T SLOUCH.

20:18.333 --> 20:20.300
STAND UP STRAIGHT.
- HORACE CONFUSED.

20:20.333 --> 20:21.867
- PUT THOSE DRAPES DOWN
THIS INSTANT.

20:21.900 --> 20:25.367
YOU ARE A BAD, BAD CAVEMAN.

20:25.400 --> 20:27.200
- VIKING.
- VIKING.

20:27.233 --> 20:29.100
LOOK AT THIS MESS.

20:29.133 --> 20:31.100
- HORACE NO LIKE YELL-Y WOMAN.

20:31.133 --> 20:32.333
- DON'T YOU SASS ME,
OR SO HELP ME,

20:32.367 --> 20:33.767
I WILL GRAB A SPATULA
AND PUT YOU

20:33.800 --> 20:35.267
OVER MY KNEE THIS INSTANT!

20:35.300 --> 20:38.200
- YOU SOUND LIKE MOMMY.

20:38.233 --> 20:39.833
- GO HOME,
AND THINK LONG AND HARD

20:39.867 --> 20:41.300
ABOUT WHAT YOU DID.

20:41.333 --> 20:42.500
OUT, NOW!

20:42.533 --> 20:44.900
- HORACE GO BYE-BYE.

20:46.733 --> 20:50.133
- IT WORKED.
HE'S GONE.

20:52.400 --> 20:55.567
WELL, GUESS EVERYTHING'S
BACK TO NORMAL, SO--

20:57.633 --> 20:59.133
I JUST SPENT
THE LAST FEW MINUTES

20:59.167 --> 21:01.200
POSSESSED BY A GHOST
AND YELLING AT A VIKING

21:01.233 --> 21:02.567
WITH MOMMY ISSUES.

21:02.600 --> 21:04.467
YOU TWO,
CLEAN THIS PLACE UP,

21:04.500 --> 21:05.900
AND THEN YOU ARE GROUNDED.

21:05.933 --> 21:09.167
SORRY, DR. VICKIE!
CRAZY EYES IS BACK!

21:09.200 --> 21:11.700
OH, THAT FELT GOOD.

21:13.133 --> 21:15.367
SORRY I MESSED THINGS UP
FOR YOU.

21:15.400 --> 21:17.233
- ACTUALLY, IT'S NOT SO BAD.

21:17.267 --> 21:18.800
BECAUSE OF YOU,
I READ MY TEXTBOOKS,

21:18.833 --> 21:20.333
AND NOW I KNOW MORE
ABOUT VIKINGS

21:20.367 --> 21:21.533
THAN I EVER WOULD HAVE.

21:21.567 --> 21:23.433
THANKS FOR THE HELP,
L-TRAIN.

21:23.467 --> 21:25.700
- YOU'RE WELCOME.

21:25.733 --> 21:28.367
SO WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS,
AT THE END OF THE DAY,

21:28.400 --> 21:30.367
