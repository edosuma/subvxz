00:13.305 --> 00:14.931
[newscaster 1 on TV]
Good news for Trump

00:15.015 --> 00:18.351
after the campaign brought in
a $18 million fundraising haul

00:18.435 --> 00:20.353
in the 24 hours following the debate.

00:20.437 --> 00:22.605
And while Trump dug in,
Clinton shined bright.

00:22.689 --> 00:25.317
[newscaster 2]  Donald Trump will stump
through three states today:

00:25.400 --> 00:27.777
Illinois, Iowa, and Wisconsin,

00:27.860 --> 00:30.697
as his running mate, Mike Pence,
tours through Ohio.

00:31.364 --> 00:34.701
[newscaster 1]  A 30-year-old
African-American male has died

00:34.784 --> 00:36.745
following a police-involved shooting...

00:36.828 --> 00:38.830
-You've got to be kidding.
-...sparking outrage

00:38.913 --> 00:40.748
and protests throughout the night.

00:40.832 --> 00:44.043
The incident occurred when police say
a black man, behaving erratically,

00:44.127 --> 00:45.670
was confronted by officers,

00:45.753 --> 00:50.258
only to be tased, then shot and killed
after he refused their instructions...

00:50.342 --> 00:52.552
[Wagner]  Hey, sleepyhead.
What you want for breakfast?

00:52.635 --> 00:54.096
[girl] Pop-Tarts.

00:54.179 --> 00:56.764
Pop-Tarts. So healthy.

00:58.975 --> 01:01.144
-[chuckles] Get up.
-[girl moans]

01:01.228 --> 01:04.147
[Wagner moaning] I know. It's terrible.

01:04.731 --> 01:08.110
Okay, eat. And then when you finish,
you need to go make your bed,

01:08.193 --> 01:10.570
and brush your teeth
and get dressed, okay?

01:11.488 --> 01:15.450
[Wagner]  She went to Florida on Thursday.
Her dad picked her up.

01:15.533 --> 01:19.287
She sees him about once a month.
She loves going there.

01:19.371 --> 01:23.040
She wants to move, though.
She's just as antsy as I am, I think.

01:23.125 --> 01:26.336
[chuckles]  She's seen the big city.
She's ready.

01:26.419 --> 01:32.008
She's like, "Mama, they got a restaurant,
and a Chuck E. Cheese, and..."

01:32.091 --> 01:33.135
[laughs]

01:33.218 --> 01:36.929
I'm like, "Yeah, it's called civilization.
It's nice, isn't it?

01:37.013 --> 01:40.475
Unfortunately, we live in the woods."
[chuckles]

01:40.558 --> 01:42.852
-[Dakota] I see you with a country guy.
-[Wagner] Oh, no.

01:42.935 --> 01:44.396
-With a black dude.
-I'm not country.

01:44.479 --> 01:45.522
A black dude?

01:45.605 --> 01:48.316
-Yeah, like a swole black dude.
-I got a lot of black guys for you.

01:48.400 --> 01:50.152
[all laugh]

01:50.235 --> 01:51.819
You just pick and choose.

01:51.903 --> 01:53.446
[Wagner]  This weekend, I have no plans.

01:53.530 --> 01:57.200
My social life has not changed,
at all, unfortunately.

01:57.284 --> 01:59.411
I mean, I'm not gonna date anyone here.

01:59.494 --> 02:02.997
I feel like I can't grow personally.

02:03.080 --> 02:06.876
Oh, no. Even the kicker can't go to class.
That's fantastic.

02:06.959 --> 02:09.629
I think if you're really in tune
with yourself,

02:09.712 --> 02:14.509
you kind of get that feeling of
when it's time to make a change.

02:14.592 --> 02:16.761
Why is the garbage can over there?

02:16.844 --> 02:18.680
I feel like I'm just stuck in this rut,

02:18.763 --> 02:20.682
and I'm not gonna get out of it,

02:20.765 --> 02:24.519
personally or professionally,
until I get out of this location.

02:26.855 --> 02:28.481
Do you have anything you can do?

02:29.732 --> 02:30.775
What's the matter?

02:35.905 --> 02:38.115
We're gonna have a good week, me and you.

02:38.200 --> 02:40.327
[sighs deeply]

02:40.410 --> 02:42.495
I feel like I'm just... I don't know.

02:45.457 --> 02:46.833
What am I doing wrong?

02:49.502 --> 02:50.545
[marching band playing]

03:22.244 --> 03:25.663
[Isaiah] "Kemper County Roadside Park."
Wait, this is a park?

03:26.247 --> 03:27.332
Where the swings?

03:27.832 --> 03:29.626
It's a park.
You know, like, a park, like--

03:29.709 --> 03:30.793
Like a memorial park?

03:32.545 --> 03:33.796
Or you know what I mean?

03:34.797 --> 03:36.299
Boo, it's boring out here.

03:36.383 --> 03:38.676
[Jazlyn] I told you
there's nothing here but trees.

03:38.760 --> 03:39.761
[Isaiah chuckles]

03:39.844 --> 03:43.055
That's all we look at every day,
if we ain't in the classroom.

03:44.432 --> 03:46.393
[Isaiah] Looking at trees. [laughs]

03:46.476 --> 03:48.436
[both] Or playing Spades.

03:48.520 --> 03:50.397
[Isaiah] I'm tired of playing Spades.

03:51.856 --> 03:53.525
I at least gotta be around something.

03:53.608 --> 03:55.735
-[Jazlyn] I wanna see snow.
-I gotta be around buildings.

03:55.818 --> 03:59.822
-Something like civilization or something.
-[Jazlyn] This is civilization.

03:59.906 --> 04:01.032
-[Isaiah] It's not.
-It is.

04:01.115 --> 04:03.535
[Isaiah] It's not.
Everywhere is civilization, I know that,

04:03.618 --> 04:05.662
but civilization requires people.

04:17.549 --> 04:21.844
-[player 1] Saw you bullshittin', bro...
-[player 2] Nah. I know what I be doing.

04:22.428 --> 04:24.889
[Wagner] Um, why were you late
to English... again?

04:24.973 --> 04:26.683
[Brian] At 8:01, she's marking us tardy.

04:26.766 --> 04:30.061
Like, if we not in at 8:01,
she highlights your name

04:30.144 --> 04:31.771
-and you're tardy.
-[Wagner] You are.

04:31.854 --> 04:33.147
8:01. You're tardy. You're right.

04:33.230 --> 04:34.941
-If it's one minute past...
-[player 1] No.

04:35.024 --> 04:36.233
-It's 8:10.
-I'm not hearing that.

04:36.318 --> 04:41.531
[Wagner] If you had practice at 3:30...

04:41.614 --> 04:43.199
-In the locker room.
-...and you walk on that field,

04:43.283 --> 04:46.661
at what, 3:25, 3:20?

04:46.744 --> 04:48.371
[Brian] It don't take me five minutes.

04:48.455 --> 04:50.748
-You're early, right? For football?
-[Brian] Kinda, a bit.

04:50.832 --> 04:53.293
-Yeah, okay.
-[player 1] What do y'all use this for?

04:53.376 --> 04:55.962
-'Cause it's the truth.
-[player 1 chuckles]

04:56.045 --> 04:58.756
If you can get there
15 minutes early for football,

04:58.840 --> 05:01.175
-you can do the same for class.
-[player 1] That dude...

05:01.258 --> 05:04.261
-But we don't gotta run for class.
-[Wagner] Hey, Isaiah, how are you?

05:04.345 --> 05:07.473
-Yeah, I'm all right.
-[Wagner] Why are you smiling like that?

05:08.891 --> 05:11.561
[Isaiah] 'Cause I gotta smile
to get through my pain.

05:11.644 --> 05:13.938
[Wagner] Physical pain, emotional pain?

05:14.021 --> 05:15.064
Emotional pain.

05:15.148 --> 05:17.525
[Wagner] What's wrong
with your emotional pain?

05:18.485 --> 05:20.362
-Tell me.
-I feel like I lost part of my soul.

05:20.445 --> 05:21.446
[Wagner] When?

05:22.113 --> 05:23.656
-[Isaiah] Hmm?
-[Wagner] When?

05:24.324 --> 05:26.451
-The other day.
-[Wagner] When you got hurt?

05:26.993 --> 05:28.453
What happened to you?

05:29.286 --> 05:30.997
[Isaiah]  At first,
she didn't wanna tell me.

05:31.080 --> 05:33.082
It took her a good couple of days
to tell me,

05:33.166 --> 05:34.834
but when she told me, it hurt.

05:35.418 --> 05:38.296
'Cause, you know,
I was about to be a father.

05:38.921 --> 05:42.258
I don't even feel like talking
about it now. I'm about to tear up.

05:43.968 --> 05:47.096
[Jazlyn]  I woke up
in a whole bunch of pain.

05:48.222 --> 05:50.392
I woke up in excruciating pain.

05:50.475 --> 05:52.059
It was hurting, hurting.

05:52.143 --> 05:54.479
Like, it's probably one of
the most painful things

05:54.562 --> 05:56.230
that I've ever been through.

05:56.313 --> 06:01.861
The fact that we got so excited,
and then... nothing.

06:02.487 --> 06:05.197
It's just, like, emptiness.

06:07.492 --> 06:09.786
[Isaiah]  It's hard.
People talking about having babies,

06:09.869 --> 06:13.790
they look at me and be like,
"Ah! Damn! I forgot. I'm sorry."

06:14.916 --> 06:18.252
I mean, I don't know...
I try to tend not to think about it.

06:19.336 --> 06:21.798
Yeah, but it's...
You know, it's always there.

06:22.882 --> 06:24.383
[Jazlyn]  You can't help
but think about it.

06:24.467 --> 06:26.052
You're gonna think about it
20 years from now.

06:26.135 --> 06:27.303
You have, like, six kids

06:27.386 --> 06:30.515
and you still gonna think about
that one that didn't make it.

06:36.521 --> 06:37.564
Yeah.

06:38.898 --> 06:40.566
But we learn to deal with it.

06:41.859 --> 06:43.319
[Isaiah]  I mean, it's bad to do it.

06:43.402 --> 06:45.988
But I know how to put every bad thing
that's happened to me

06:46.072 --> 06:48.783
deep down inside and just lock it up.

07:01.253 --> 07:03.631
[Tooney] Gonna talk about how pissed off
I am about the situation,

07:03.715 --> 07:06.926
that we probably ain't gonna be playing
for the national championship,

07:07.009 --> 07:10.387
which is a bunch of bullshit
'cause the number one, number two team,

07:10.472 --> 07:12.932
-they ain't playing the same teams we are.
-[interviewer] Yeah.

07:13.015 --> 07:15.477
I mean, they don't have
the same strength of schedule.

07:15.560 --> 07:17.353
We're kinda like the SEC.

07:17.437 --> 07:20.940
[man] Mississippi Slim, breakfast!
Before he passes out.

07:21.023 --> 07:22.024
It's about time!

07:22.108 --> 07:24.193
[man] His friend'll
have to give him mouth-to-mouth.

07:24.276 --> 07:25.903
[all laugh]

07:25.987 --> 07:30.157
[man] But I know I ain't putting my lips
on his. I guarantee you!

07:30.241 --> 07:32.201
[Tooney] There's some things
worth dying for.

07:32.284 --> 07:34.411
-[all laugh]
-Hey, look... Look...

07:34.496 --> 07:38.791
Our mustaches might get hung up.
You know what I'm talking 'bout?

07:38.875 --> 07:42.044
-And then, boy, that'd be a sight.
-[woman] Yeah.

07:42.128 --> 07:45.673
[Tooney] We beat this team the other day.
It was 42, 43-nothing.

07:45.757 --> 07:49.802
I don't know, we may need to beat
this team here, you know, 70 or 80.

07:49.886 --> 07:52.597
You know, they don't want us
to run the score up,

07:52.680 --> 07:57.059
but they don't wanna vote fairly.
That's bull.

07:57.143 --> 07:59.937
I reckon we beat 'em, 80 or 90,

08:00.021 --> 08:03.065
hell, they gotta look at us
some kind of way. [chuckles]

08:04.526 --> 08:06.068
[Wood] I need you to understand.

08:06.152 --> 08:08.237
This is your last regular season practice.

08:08.320 --> 08:11.783
When we get into next week, you got
one more game that you're promised.

08:11.866 --> 08:14.243
And that's it. So every practice
has gotta mean something.

08:14.326 --> 08:16.328
Make it your best,
make every one of 'em your best,

08:16.412 --> 08:17.454
'cause you're down to it.

08:18.039 --> 08:19.456
Don't take it for granted.

08:19.541 --> 08:22.126
I'll see y'all. Go get dressed.
Hop up! Hop up! Hop up!

08:22.710 --> 08:24.754
A lot of sleepy guys in here.
We got sleepy guys.

08:25.379 --> 08:27.339
Got a bunch of sleepy kids.
Let's go, let's go!

08:27.882 --> 08:29.425
[Isaiah] I hate being hurt.

08:30.051 --> 08:31.636
[player] You can't practice this week?

08:32.261 --> 08:33.555
I can't even run.

08:34.806 --> 08:37.474
I tried yesterday and 'bout collapsed.

08:38.726 --> 08:41.938
'Bout to go down here
and watch them boys practice.

08:43.022 --> 08:44.941
-[coach] There you go!
-[whistle blowing]

08:47.735 --> 08:48.903
[Isaiah groans]

08:50.446 --> 08:52.364
[Wood] Back up, spread out.
Back up, spread out.

08:52.448 --> 08:54.701
Everything we do right here
is how we attack it.

08:54.784 --> 08:57.620
Ready, go, go, go, good.

08:58.329 --> 09:00.748
Ready, go, go, go, good.

09:00.832 --> 09:02.458
Back it up, back it up. Good. Back up.

09:03.500 --> 09:05.127
-[coach 1] Sprint.
-[coach 2] Go, go.

09:05.211 --> 09:06.838
[player laughs] You lazy, bro.

09:06.921 --> 09:10.508
You that good, but you lazy as fuck, bro.
Your group out there, bro.

09:10.592 --> 09:13.970
[Isaiah] I may have this wedding, bro,
somewhere in Florida.

09:14.053 --> 09:15.763
-[Vijay] Florida?
-[player] You finna get married?

09:15.847 --> 09:17.306
-[Isaiah] Probably Key West.
-[player] You're too young.

09:17.389 --> 09:18.474
[Vijay] You don't know what Key West is...

09:18.558 --> 09:21.435
[Isaiah] I mean, I know what it is.
I mean, I just ain't never been.

09:21.519 --> 09:22.895
[Buddy] You ain't gonna learn.

09:22.979 --> 09:24.689
You know who I'm talking to.
You ain't gonna learn.

09:24.772 --> 09:26.816
-I ain't do nothing.
-[Buddy] You ain't gonna learn.

09:26.899 --> 09:28.067
Stay here with your teammates.

09:28.651 --> 09:30.111
-What?
-[Buddy] Okay?

09:30.737 --> 09:33.280
Stay back here with your teammates,
where you supposed to be,

09:33.364 --> 09:34.949
with the rest of the offense.

09:35.449 --> 09:37.577
No, I want you to stay
with your teammates,

09:37.660 --> 09:39.203
-where you supposed to be.
-[Isaiah] Yes, sir.

09:39.286 --> 09:41.330
-Not on the side, playing around!
-[Isaiah] Yes, sir.

09:41.413 --> 09:43.374
-Don't say nothing. Don't say nothing.
-[chuckles]

09:43.457 --> 09:45.292
[Trickett] Here we go.
Set it. Set it. Set it.

09:45.376 --> 09:47.419
[player] He laughed at his ass.

09:50.172 --> 09:51.758
[Buddy] I try to be as nice,

09:51.841 --> 09:54.051
open and talkative to you,
but you ain't listening...

09:54.135 --> 09:55.136
No, bullshit!

09:55.219 --> 09:56.929
-[Isaiah] What'd I do?
-You're laughing,

09:57.013 --> 09:58.055
cutting up and clowning...

09:58.139 --> 10:00.432
with the defense when there's
no reason for you to be there.

10:00.516 --> 10:01.893
You're supposed to be here
with your teammates.

10:02.810 --> 10:04.311
Jeez, Almighty.

10:04.395 --> 10:06.898
Listen, you can quit now. I don't care.

10:06.981 --> 10:09.901
Okay, go ahead and quit now.
I'm good with it.

10:09.984 --> 10:13.279
I promise you. I'm good with it.
Go ahead and leave and quit now.

10:13.362 --> 10:14.571
Don't talk under your breath.

10:14.656 --> 10:17.033
If you wanna say something,
be a man and say it to me.

10:17.116 --> 10:20.411
But don't talk under your breath
'cause that's bullshit.

10:23.580 --> 10:25.207
[coach] Right now, Tyrell, in.

10:26.417 --> 10:29.586
I was literally standing there,
watching them. I was watching them.

10:29.671 --> 10:32.048
-[player] Who you talking about?
-And he snapped on me. What?

10:32.131 --> 10:33.633
[laughs]

10:33.716 --> 10:36.302
And then say
I can't do nothing but laugh, dog,

10:36.385 --> 10:37.929
'cause it's funny
'cause I ain't do nothing.

10:38.012 --> 10:39.806
He looked at me
and I seen him lookin' at me.

10:39.889 --> 10:41.724
He looked at me
and then he shook his head.

10:41.808 --> 10:44.435
"Oh, you don't learn, huh?" What?

10:44.518 --> 10:46.062
[both chuckling]

10:47.271 --> 10:50.191
You a coach and all that
but you also still a adult.

10:50.942 --> 10:53.444
You still a grown man,
like I'm a grown man.

10:53.527 --> 10:55.321
-You respect me...
-[Eszmone] And I'll respect you.

10:55.404 --> 10:57.031
...the way you want me to respect you.

10:57.114 --> 10:58.532
Sorry, you ain't about to come at me

10:58.616 --> 11:02.662
and then you sit here
and cuss me out for nothing.

11:02.745 --> 11:04.789
And then expect me to say
"Yes, sir" to your face?

11:04.872 --> 11:06.666
[Eszmone] And do say, "Yes, sir."

11:06.749 --> 11:08.668
[Isaiah] And you still tell me
to shut the fuck up.

11:08.751 --> 11:10.962
[chuckling] Still tell you
to shut the fuck up.

11:11.045 --> 11:14.631
Let's go. Some of y'all other yo-yos
don't get scared to get out here and play.

11:14.716 --> 11:16.258
[chuckling]

11:16.342 --> 11:18.177
[Buddy] Horsley!
I ain't putting up with that.

11:18.260 --> 11:20.722
Get out. You're through
with practice today. Get the hell off.

11:20.805 --> 11:23.015
Come here and laugh now.
Yeah, I ain't messing with you.

11:23.099 --> 11:26.310
Get off the field. I ain't fucking around.
Get off the field!

11:27.561 --> 11:30.231
[Eszmone] What's going on?
Why is he cussing everybody out now?

11:30.314 --> 11:32.942
Is it because we're getting close
to nationals, or...

11:33.025 --> 11:34.026
I don't know.

11:34.110 --> 11:35.862
I think it's because we're getting close.

11:35.945 --> 11:37.780
-I don't know.
-We actually might win it.

11:37.864 --> 11:43.077
Set the edge. Do it again.
Set the edge! Get down!

11:43.160 --> 11:45.662
I'm trying to stay calm and not snap.

11:45.747 --> 11:47.623
-[coach] Don't change.
-[Isaiah] I'm trying to.

11:47.707 --> 11:49.917
-[cheering and clamoring]
-[Williams] Here! Here! Here!

11:50.001 --> 11:54.171
[Eszmone] As long as you stay around me
and my friends, you're good. You're good.

11:54.756 --> 11:56.382
Just come play Xbox all damn day.

11:56.465 --> 11:59.176
We'll let you get the Xbox,
and you sit there and play games.

11:59.260 --> 12:00.511
-All day.
-[Isaiah] Yo, that's--

12:00.594 --> 12:03.680
We got all of the  Assassin's Creed.

12:03.764 --> 12:06.559
So you just going around killing people
for no reason.

12:06.725 --> 12:07.726
Yeah!

12:10.271 --> 12:11.439
[Bontrager] Isaiah?

12:11.522 --> 12:14.900
From what I saw with him running
up and down the sideline on Thursday,

12:14.984 --> 12:17.444
there's nothing wrong with...
why he can't practice.

12:17.528 --> 12:20.614
[Buddy] Fine. That's all I need to know.
That's all I needed to know.

12:21.866 --> 12:24.243
Some of you like a six-pack of glass.

12:24.326 --> 12:26.788
Ain't no telling when you gonna break.
All right?

12:26.871 --> 12:28.664
But you gotta understand, you gotta...

12:28.747 --> 12:31.667
You gotta know what's at stake
for this game.

12:31.750 --> 12:35.379
You lose, your ass ain't playing
for a national championship.

12:36.047 --> 12:37.589
That's it. Bottom line!

12:38.800 --> 12:41.552
And you can get that long face
and you can look and you can wonder,

12:41.635 --> 12:42.719
"Hey, why it didn't happen?"

12:43.554 --> 12:46.057
Because you didn't practice hard,
because you didn't practice.

12:46.140 --> 12:49.393
I'm tired of it. I'm tired of it.
Ain't gonna put up with it.

12:50.311 --> 12:53.355
Way too much mouthing going on out here
and not enough practice.

12:53.940 --> 12:57.401
So if you don't practice,
you don't play. That's it.

12:59.570 --> 13:01.780
-[tapping controller]
-[Maleke] The type of players we are,

13:01.864 --> 13:04.033
we don't need no soft coach.

13:04.116 --> 13:08.412
He opening up our eyes, really.
'Cause I mean, the real world ain't nice.

13:09.621 --> 13:11.874
[Isaiah] A coach gonna see
what a coach gonna see

13:11.958 --> 13:14.585
and then, at the end of the day,
you're still...

13:14.668 --> 13:17.213
You still gotta grind
and try to get some more.

13:17.296 --> 13:20.007
I ain't never had an injury like this
that's put me out of games

13:20.091 --> 13:21.633
that I ain't never came back from.

13:21.717 --> 13:24.303
Once you get that injury,
you always tend to get that,

13:24.386 --> 13:28.307
"Oh, should I... should I do
what I do usually on it

13:28.390 --> 13:32.228
and suffer the consequences
of messing it up again...

13:32.895 --> 13:36.232
or just be your dog and just play on it?"

13:36.315 --> 13:40.486
I might not come with no big things,
but I'mma contribute.

13:41.863 --> 13:43.948
[stadium announcer]
Brings up a third down.

13:44.031 --> 13:45.908
[crowd cheering]

13:46.575 --> 13:49.036
[Crowder]  EMCC is up by four touchdowns

13:49.120 --> 13:51.247
but it's almost gonna seem
on the sidelines

13:51.330 --> 13:54.250
like EMCC is down
because they just haven't been

13:54.333 --> 13:56.919
very sharp on offense
the last couple of possessions.

13:57.003 --> 13:59.046
The snap to Johnson.
He's looking over the middle.

13:59.130 --> 14:01.673
Now back to pass
and now diving forward to the 21

14:01.757 --> 14:03.550
-after a gain of two.
-Get rid of it.

14:03.634 --> 14:05.594
[Crowder]  It's going to bring up
a third down now and six.

14:05.677 --> 14:06.971
Jesus, God.

14:08.097 --> 14:10.099
I just need a couple of yards.

14:11.392 --> 14:13.144
Just loosen up and get in.

14:13.227 --> 14:16.063
[Isaiah] That's what I needed.
I need a run on it and loosen it up.

14:16.147 --> 14:20.067
-[Wood] Did you want Isaiah?
-I don't care. I don't care.

14:20.151 --> 14:23.195
[Wood] All right, running backs,
we'll rotate. Isaiah!

14:23.279 --> 14:25.156
-Hey, we got ball?
-Yeah.

14:26.198 --> 14:27.950
[Lee] All right, Isaiah. Go do your thing.

14:28.034 --> 14:29.743
[Crowder]  Wright
for the first time this game.

14:29.826 --> 14:31.203
He's got a high ankle sprain,

14:31.287 --> 14:33.705
but obviously heavily taped
and gonna play today.

14:33.789 --> 14:35.875
He's bottled up
as he tries to go around the right end.

14:35.958 --> 14:39.420
He ain't even... He's just running.
He's running straight at the dadgum ball.

14:39.503 --> 14:41.255
They got blown back, Coach.

14:41.755 --> 14:44.133
Then he should be able to make
a cut somewhere, huh?

14:44.216 --> 14:46.593
[Crowder]  This has just been
a struggle for EMCC

14:46.677 --> 14:49.680
with any kinda rhythm
and some sloppiness here on this drive.

14:49.763 --> 14:50.847
He's gonna leave it
on the ground with Wright,

14:50.932 --> 14:52.683
comes around left side,
tries to spin out of a tackle

14:52.766 --> 14:53.893
around the line of scrimmage.

14:53.976 --> 14:55.727
-And he just goes down.
-[Isaiah] Fuck.

14:55.811 --> 14:57.354
[Crowder]  So it's gonna bring up
a third down and long.

14:57.438 --> 15:00.107
He's running straight at the dadgum ball.
Get him out.

15:00.191 --> 15:02.234
[Crowder]  So at the half,
that's where we stand.

15:02.318 --> 15:04.403
Not that EMCC has played poorly,

15:04.486 --> 15:07.823
they just haven't connected in the last
two drives to end the second quarter.

15:07.907 --> 15:09.491
[Buddy]  Don't let four...

15:09.575 --> 15:11.243
-Don't let four back in.
-[Wood]  We're not.

15:11.327 --> 15:13.370
-His foot's bothering him.
-[Buddy]  And yeah,

15:13.454 --> 15:16.082
they knocked him back,
but did you see the route he took?

15:16.165 --> 15:19.085
He took it straight.
He took it running at the damn B-gap.

15:19.168 --> 15:20.169
[Wood]  Right.

15:20.252 --> 15:21.587
-[Buddy]  He just--
-[Wood]  He can't cut.

15:21.670 --> 15:22.754
[Buddy]  He's done.

15:22.838 --> 15:24.173
[Wood]  I'm gonna work better
in the second half.

15:24.256 --> 15:26.592
-I am.
-[Buddy]  No, I'm... Listen...

15:27.176 --> 15:29.261
[Wood]  I'm not being... I'm being sincere.

15:29.345 --> 15:32.181
[Buddy]  Please don't. Please, please.
Don't do that.

15:39.981 --> 15:41.983
Thinking I'm gonna holler or something.

15:44.318 --> 15:46.320
[grunts] Get that damn thing out of here.

15:47.947 --> 15:49.781
-[Buddy] You're done.
-[Isaiah] What happened?

15:49.865 --> 15:53.077
[Buddy sighs] You're limping more now
than you were yesterday.

15:53.160 --> 15:54.286
What happened?

15:54.370 --> 15:55.579
[Isaiah] Nah, let me run on it.

15:55.662 --> 15:59.125
[Buddy] No, no, done.
You don't understand, brother.

15:59.208 --> 16:01.627
I'm trying to get you...
I'm trying to get you scholarships.

16:01.710 --> 16:04.588
People are gonna start taking 'em
from you. [sighs]

16:04.672 --> 16:07.174
[Isaiah] Man, you act like
I'm a damn robot, dog.

16:09.885 --> 16:12.554
Okay, Buddy, like I'm a robot, man.
It's... [sighs]

16:12.638 --> 16:14.056
I'm trying my best though.

16:14.140 --> 16:15.516
-I'm trying, bro.
-[Buddy] Hey.

16:15.599 --> 16:18.477
-[Isaiah] I understand what he saying--
-[Buddy] Shut up. Shut up.

16:18.560 --> 16:21.480
-You whine so damn much. Damn.
-[Isaiah] All right, bro.

16:21.563 --> 16:23.649
-I ain't your bro.
-[Isaiah] Get the fuck out my face.

16:23.732 --> 16:26.568
-[Buddy] What? Hey, please say it again.
-[Isaiah] 'Cause this is bull--

16:26.652 --> 16:27.987
[Buddy] Please say it again.

16:31.448 --> 16:33.617
[whispers] Take your shit off
and go to the dorm now.

16:33.701 --> 16:35.536
Take your shit off and go. You're done.

16:36.787 --> 16:39.165
You chose...
Hey, you chose to take it there.

16:39.248 --> 16:42.959
That was your choice.
Just what we talked about yesterday.

16:43.043 --> 16:45.838
-What we talked about yesterday.
-[Isaiah] I didn't do nothing to you.

16:45.921 --> 16:49.466
Not knowing when to shut your mouth.
Get your stuff off. Take it off.

16:51.093 --> 16:53.053
[Isaiah] What else this man want me to do?

16:53.387 --> 16:56.098
He act like I don't know
I'm losing scholarships.

17:08.277 --> 17:11.405
[Buddy]  No, no. I don't want him...
I don't want him nowhere around.

17:11.488 --> 17:12.989
Let him go sit up in the stands.

17:13.074 --> 17:15.576
Not on the sideline.
I don't want him around me.

17:15.659 --> 17:17.994
-[coach]  Press box with Trickett?
-[Buddy]  I don't want him around.

17:18.079 --> 17:19.955
'Cause I'm sick of him.

17:20.956 --> 17:22.833
How can you let that happen?

17:22.916 --> 17:24.418
Do you want a kid...

17:24.501 --> 17:27.671
Do you want a kid that's telling you
you need to get out of his face?

17:28.255 --> 17:29.631
How can you let it happen?

17:38.640 --> 17:41.268
Like, the cut on it, yeah...

17:41.643 --> 17:45.397
-Go, cameras go. Cameras, get out, go.
-Hey, get out, get out, get out.

17:49.610 --> 17:51.820
[Crowder]  We're back here
at Sullivan-Windham Field.

17:51.903 --> 17:54.281
The final regular season game of the year.

17:54.365 --> 17:56.908
Buddy Stephens has said
they're going to throw out all the stops

17:56.992 --> 17:58.952
to go out on a high note to end 2016.

17:59.035 --> 18:00.621
Why you ain't playing?

18:00.704 --> 18:02.081
The man kicked me out.

18:02.164 --> 18:04.040
[Crowder]  You got 28-nothing
but you're looking to finish.

18:04.125 --> 18:05.126
You're looking to close the deal.

18:05.209 --> 18:06.543
The snap.
They're going to leave it with Horsley.

18:06.627 --> 18:09.004
He's gonna come around near side,
break a couple of tackles.

18:09.088 --> 18:11.090
Have the first down!
Across the 30, across the 35,

18:11.173 --> 18:12.424
on his feet, breaking tackles,

18:12.508 --> 18:16.512
and he's gonna be ridden down from behind
at the 42-yard line. First down.

18:16.595 --> 18:18.472
Hey, that a way, Horse! That a way.

18:18.555 --> 18:20.141
[Crowder]  A nice run by Jacquez Horsley.

18:20.224 --> 18:23.018
[Winfield]  There have been good backs
wear number 22 here,

18:23.102 --> 18:25.437
and Horsley looking like
a feature back tonight.

18:25.521 --> 18:26.855
[Beard]  Absolutely, Charlie.

18:26.938 --> 18:29.858
We've seen a number of
tremendous running backs

18:29.941 --> 18:32.653
here at East Mississippi,
and Horsley's fitting that mold perfectly.

18:32.736 --> 18:34.655
[Crowder]  Miller raises his left leg.
Takes the snap.

18:34.738 --> 18:36.907
Leaves it on the ground
and Horsley goes into the end zone

18:36.990 --> 18:40.076
for his second touchdown of the game.
And it's now 41-nothing.

18:40.161 --> 18:42.829
[Buddy] Whoo-hoo! Attababy!

18:42.913 --> 18:45.666
Yeah! Chauncey!

18:45.749 --> 18:49.711
[Winfield]  And with that run,
Horsley now goes to 132 yards on the game.

18:49.795 --> 18:55.467
Let it go. That's it. Hey, great job!
Hey, hey, nice job tonight, baby.

18:55.551 --> 18:58.304
[Isaiah] Bro,
I'm doing what you telling me to do, bro.

18:58.387 --> 19:00.389
But then when I do the thing
you told me to do,

19:00.472 --> 19:02.974
you snap on me
for doing the thing you told me to do.

19:03.058 --> 19:04.100
What you want me to do?

19:04.185 --> 19:05.311
[Lee] Sometimes you gotta

19:05.394 --> 19:07.354
-soak it like a sponge.
-[Isaiah] I am.

19:07.938 --> 19:10.441
Dad, I've been soaking this
the whole week.

19:10.524 --> 19:13.610
I'm tired of kicking people...
Kissing people's ass, dog. I'm done.

19:13.694 --> 19:15.404
I'm tired of kissing people's ass.

19:15.612 --> 19:18.365
[Crowder]
EMCC winning 42-nothing over Hinds

19:18.449 --> 19:20.534
to complete the regular season, 2016.

19:20.617 --> 19:24.288
And the playoffs await
and it's do or die from here on out.

19:24.371 --> 19:26.081
[Buddy]  Great job. But here's the deal.

19:26.915 --> 19:30.211
Now we started, okay?
Now we started. Hey.

19:30.836 --> 19:35.341
We lose, we're done.
We ain't losing. You understand?

19:35.424 --> 19:40.304
Everybody get in tight.
Everybody, get in tight. Our Father...

19:40.387 --> 19:42.055
[all]  Who art in Heaven,
hallowed be thy name.

19:42.138 --> 19:44.391
Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done,
on Earth as it is in Heaven.

19:44.475 --> 19:46.643
Give us this day our daily bread,
and forgive us our trespasses,

19:46.727 --> 19:48.061
as we forgive those
who trespass against us.

19:48.144 --> 19:50.021
And lead us not into temptation...

19:55.944 --> 19:58.447
[Dakota]  Yo, I was watching
the Trump thing on Twitter.

19:58.530 --> 20:00.657
-Yo, that guy's a idiot.
-[player] That man a dumbass.

20:00.741 --> 20:04.035
[Dakota] Like, if he came here,
I'd probably punch him in the throat.

20:04.119 --> 20:06.455
No, he was talking
about black people one time,

20:06.538 --> 20:08.999
and he was like... He said,

20:09.082 --> 20:12.586
"Y'all don't have any money.
Y'all's schools are..." You know...

20:12.669 --> 20:14.255
He was basically saying, we don't...

20:14.338 --> 20:16.382
We broke as hell,
our schools are the shit,

20:16.465 --> 20:19.343
what do we have to lose?
What kind of shit is that?

20:19.426 --> 20:21.345
[player] Man, if he be president,
I promise you,

20:21.428 --> 20:23.347
-the United States gonna fall.
-[Dakota] We can't do shit.

20:23.430 --> 20:25.932
But then again, Hillary ain't no better.

20:26.016 --> 20:27.559
-She be lying.
-[player] But this wouldn't have--

20:27.643 --> 20:29.478
[Brian] I'mma tell y'all
who was a cold president.

20:30.145 --> 20:31.772
Richard Nixon. He was cold as hell.

20:31.855 --> 20:33.857
-[player] That motherfucker was hell.
-I'mma tell you.

20:33.940 --> 20:36.109
[Wagner] Dakota,
you have a B in literature.

20:37.611 --> 20:38.779
Sheesh.

20:38.862 --> 20:41.948
Man, last semester,
my finals ain't go too good.

20:42.032 --> 20:46.370
I ain't studied for no finals or nothing.
I was trying to stay out of jail.

20:46.453 --> 20:49.498
-[player laughing]
-[Wagner] Oh, Lord. Terrible.

20:49.581 --> 20:51.250
Tim. Math.

20:52.042 --> 20:53.252
Tim!

20:53.335 --> 20:54.753
-[Tim] What happened?
-I'm talking to you.

20:54.836 --> 20:56.755
-[Tim] I know. I'm finna go now.
-Come here.

20:56.838 --> 20:59.258
-What do you have to do this week?
-[Tim] Huh?

20:59.341 --> 21:01.510
-Man, chill. Chill, bro.
-[Wagner] Look at me.

21:02.052 --> 21:04.596
Seriously. Stop.
What do you have to do this week?

21:05.096 --> 21:06.598
I don't know. [stammers]

21:06.682 --> 21:09.142
I don't know if we got no tests
or nothing. I don't know yet.

21:09.225 --> 21:10.811
[Wagner] You need to make sure

21:10.894 --> 21:13.439
you get all your homework and quizzes
for college algebra done.

21:13.522 --> 21:14.731
-Yeah.
-[Wagner] Those quizzes for history?

21:14.815 --> 21:16.858
-Did you ever do those?
-No, I'm working on 'em.

21:16.942 --> 21:19.027
[Wagner] You need...
Sit down and do 'em right now.

21:19.110 --> 21:20.404
-I--
-[Wagner] You got 30 minutes.

21:20.487 --> 21:21.947
That's what I want you to do.

21:22.489 --> 21:23.865
-Miss Brittany--
-[Wagner] Tim.

21:26.285 --> 21:27.661
Do the history quizzes.

21:28.829 --> 21:31.540
All right, look.
Do you see this GPA right there?

21:31.623 --> 21:33.249
What does your GPA have to be to transfer?

21:33.333 --> 21:35.377
-[Chauncey] A 2.5.
-[Wagner] Is that a 2.5?

21:35.877 --> 21:39.089
Miss Brittany,
I'm this close from dropping out.

21:39.172 --> 21:41.342
[Wagner] No, you're not.
Why are you saying that?

21:41.425 --> 21:43.218
All these fucking classes.

21:43.302 --> 21:45.262
[Wagner] But I know. But we knew this.

21:45.345 --> 21:48.932
We got this. We knew this, come on.

21:49.015 --> 21:50.559
[Calvin]  I didn't do well on that test.

21:50.642 --> 21:51.518
[Wagner] Which one?

21:51.602 --> 21:53.269
The one we took that I didn't know we had.

21:53.354 --> 21:55.188
[Wagner] The Western civ one?

21:55.271 --> 21:57.065
You know why
y'all don't do well on the tests?

21:57.148 --> 21:59.901
Can I enlighten you
with why you don't do good on the tests?

21:59.985 --> 22:01.653
-I would appreciate that.
-[Wagner] Here's why--

22:01.737 --> 22:04.114
No, no, no, no. I need you to listen.
Turn your head...

22:04.197 --> 22:06.450
Turn your music off
'cause I need this to soak in.

22:06.533 --> 22:08.744
Here's why y'all don't do good
on the tests.

22:08.827 --> 22:11.913
Because you cheat on the quizzes

22:11.997 --> 22:15.041
and y'all don't do the quizzes
and you cheat.

22:15.125 --> 22:19.546
And all the test is, is the quizzes copied
and pasted into another document,

22:19.630 --> 22:23.342
but you cheat on the quizzes
so you're not learning the material,

22:23.425 --> 22:25.552
and then you get on a test,
and guess what?

22:25.636 --> 22:29.515
You've never seen those questions before
because you don't even read the quiz.

22:29.598 --> 22:31.517
Because all y'all are doing
is just cheating.

22:32.100 --> 22:33.852
So now we've failed the test.

22:33.935 --> 22:35.103
-[Snoop] What happens--
-[Wagner] Sorry.

22:35.687 --> 22:38.190
-When I cheat on my quiz, I study.
-[Wagner] Exactly.

22:38.273 --> 22:40.233
-I studied.
-[Wagner] When you cheat, you study?

22:40.316 --> 22:41.860
-I study.
-[Wagner] Bullshit.

22:41.943 --> 22:43.737
-[players laugh]
-[Wagner] When you cheat, you cheat.

22:43.820 --> 22:45.572
You don't study when you're cheating.

22:45.656 --> 22:47.824
-But go on and keep flunking.
-[Snoop] Okay, good.

22:47.908 --> 22:50.285
-[Calvin] You make it seem so bad.
-[Wagner] It  is  bad.

22:50.368 --> 22:53.580
There's no reason
why you shouldn't make good on the test.

22:53.664 --> 22:54.915
-[Calvin] I'm saying...
-[Snoop] I made--

22:54.998 --> 22:56.417
...it ain't really cheating.

22:56.500 --> 22:59.002
[Wagner] Okay, let me put it
into a different perspective here.

22:59.085 --> 23:02.548
-Let's switch this to football.
-Mm-hmm.

23:02.631 --> 23:07.553
If Gulf Coast drove over here
and gave us their playbook,

23:07.636 --> 23:11.640
and they said, "Here is the order in which
we are gonna run the plays on Thursday.

23:11.723 --> 23:13.099
Exact plays. Here they are."

23:13.183 --> 23:14.810
And you didn't look at it.

23:14.893 --> 23:16.937
And then you go out there
and you get beat.

23:17.020 --> 23:18.522
How dumb do you look?

23:18.605 --> 23:21.650
She's given you the playbook,
and you're ignoring her.

23:21.733 --> 23:23.610
It's a complete lack of respect.

23:23.694 --> 23:25.361
If Gulf Coast gave you the playbook

23:25.446 --> 23:28.239
and you didn't even respect them enough
to open it,

23:28.323 --> 23:30.200
then you deserve to get your ass beat.

23:30.283 --> 23:31.702
-[Calvin] It ain't like that.
-Same thing.

23:31.785 --> 23:35.371
You deserve to fail
if you can't log on and, like, try,

23:35.456 --> 23:37.874
-when she's given you the playbook.
-[Calvin] You right.

23:37.958 --> 23:39.125
You made a very...

23:39.209 --> 23:40.461
That point fire, though.

23:40.544 --> 23:41.587
[Wagner] Fire point.

23:41.670 --> 23:43.589
Okay, so then say,
"Know what? You're right.

23:43.672 --> 23:45.966
I'm gonna do better.
I'm not gonna do that anymore,

23:46.049 --> 23:48.051
'cause you're right.
That is dumb on my part."

23:48.134 --> 23:49.886
I was getting there.
I was gonna get to that.

23:49.970 --> 23:51.722
[Snoop chuckles] But I think I did good.

23:54.307 --> 23:55.183
[sighs]

23:55.266 --> 23:56.643
-[Snoop] Miss Wagner?
-What?

23:56.726 --> 23:58.437
[Snoop] I know you love your job.

23:59.771 --> 24:01.189
You love us.

24:01.273 --> 24:03.442
I love y'all. Yeah, I do.

24:11.491 --> 24:13.160
[Devaunya]
Brittany and I did not hit it off

24:13.243 --> 24:15.036
from the beginning at all.

24:15.871 --> 24:17.455
We didn't gel.

24:17.539 --> 24:20.250
I didn't like the role she played

24:20.333 --> 24:22.335
and who she thought she was.
But in the end...

24:23.003 --> 24:26.798
I respect and love everything
about that woman because she cares.

24:26.882 --> 24:29.760
She goes to the 19th degree

24:29.843 --> 24:32.220
for every one of them boys
that come through her office.

24:32.303 --> 24:34.556
They are a part of her heart,

24:34.640 --> 24:37.809
and she's gonna make sure
that she gets them in there,

24:37.893 --> 24:39.853
and up out of there
to whatever they aspire to be.

24:39.936 --> 24:42.105
Are you gonna pull up your paper,
smarty pants?

24:42.188 --> 24:43.148
-[player] Mine broke.
-[Chauncey] Yes.

24:43.231 --> 24:44.858
[Devaunya]  Many times
in the ninth hour, he was like,

24:44.941 --> 24:46.276
"I don't know if I can do this."

24:46.359 --> 24:48.945
And she would say,
"Miss Rivers, he gonna be all right."

24:50.280 --> 24:51.573
Ain't too many like her.

24:52.282 --> 24:53.784
Ain't too many like her.

25:01.332 --> 25:03.835
-[Buddy] Artful close-ups?
-[cameraman chuckles] Oh, come on.

25:03.919 --> 25:07.047
Yeah, we'd like for all the women to see
how big my hands are.

25:07.130 --> 25:08.882
Isn't that what Trump said?

25:08.965 --> 25:11.509
-[cameraman chuckles] Yeah.
-Oh, jeez.

25:11.593 --> 25:13.970
This week has a lot of implications.

25:14.054 --> 25:15.722
We're ranked number three in the country.

25:15.805 --> 25:17.390
Uh, we've gotta continue to win

25:17.474 --> 25:21.102
to have an opportunity to play
for a national championship.

25:21.186 --> 25:24.272
For a state championship first,
and then for a national championship.

25:25.273 --> 25:28.234
[Wood] Whoosh! ESPN-worthy.

25:29.152 --> 25:30.528
[Buddy]  Gulf Coast is coming in.

25:30.612 --> 25:34.700
They've improved from the second ball game
when we beat 'em.

25:34.783 --> 25:39.204
I don't know that Gulf Coast
had ever been mercy-ruled before.

25:39.287 --> 25:41.623
But they were in that game.

25:41.707 --> 25:45.877
And I'm sure they've got a little revenge
on their mind.

25:46.670 --> 25:49.965
[Williams] You guys gotta realize
the situation that you're in.

25:50.048 --> 25:52.550
And I really don't want y'all
to take this for granted.

25:52.634 --> 25:54.678
I really don't want y'all to be like...

25:55.303 --> 25:57.180
"Man, I can't wait
till the season's over."

25:57.263 --> 25:59.224
Don't worry about
where you're trying to go.

25:59.307 --> 26:01.142
Don't worry about
who gonna recruit you, man.

26:01.226 --> 26:03.228
Worry about finishing
this season off strong

26:03.311 --> 26:06.106
with these guys in this room
and them fellas on your team.

26:06.565 --> 26:09.776
Okay, it's gonna mean something to you,
leaving here as a champion.

26:09.985 --> 26:11.820
You're gonna feel
a sense of accomplishment

26:11.903 --> 26:15.782
at any level that you play at
when you win a championship.

26:16.407 --> 26:19.661
[Williams]  I'm excited about
seeing how I, as a coach,

26:19.745 --> 26:23.248
can affect the individual
to go out there and do his best.

26:23.957 --> 26:28.044
At how well he's gonna listen
to the things that I've been teaching him.

26:28.128 --> 26:31.923
Excited about seeing a kid graduate,
making something out of theirself.

26:32.007 --> 26:33.800
I'm excited about that stuff.

26:33.884 --> 26:36.970
Good job right here, Snoop, okay?
Snatchin' him.

26:37.053 --> 26:39.681
Great job right here snatching
and finishing.

26:39.765 --> 26:41.683
[player] Big up, Snoopy!

26:41.767 --> 26:42.851
[Williams]  What they've gone through,

26:42.934 --> 26:45.353
majority of the time
I've gone through myself.

26:45.436 --> 26:50.441
But I just try to be somebody for them
that I would want to have for me.

26:50.525 --> 26:52.068
[Snoop]  Being honest and being 100,

26:52.152 --> 26:54.696
have you seen a difference in the way
I approach practice?

26:54.780 --> 26:56.322
[players chuckling]

26:56.406 --> 26:58.366
On a scale of one to ten,

26:58.449 --> 27:01.536
with ten being the biggest difference,
okay?

27:01.619 --> 27:03.371
One being the worst,

27:03.454 --> 27:05.791
I say you 'bout hit a four-and-a-half,
five right now.

27:05.874 --> 27:07.083
[players chuckling]

27:07.167 --> 27:09.544
[Williams]  Some will respond, some won't.

27:09.627 --> 27:12.422
The guys who do respond,
they appreciate it.

27:12.505 --> 27:14.382
The guys who won't respond, you know,

27:14.465 --> 27:17.719
those are the guys
who gonna really have a hard time in life.

27:17.803 --> 27:20.638
Wake up, Kam. Stand up.

27:24.059 --> 27:26.102
Biggest game of the year,
and you asleep in the meeting.

27:26.186 --> 27:30.065
Stand up! I didn't say sit down
on the damn table. Stand up.

27:30.148 --> 27:32.734
'Cause at the end of the day,
I'm not gonna tell these young men

27:32.818 --> 27:35.153
anything that I wouldn't tell
my own child,

27:35.236 --> 27:39.240
or that my mom, or my uncles
or my coaches haven't told me.

27:41.076 --> 27:42.077
Mama.

27:43.411 --> 27:45.622
-Where the food at? Hey!
-[Lillie] Hi, son!

27:46.081 --> 27:48.124
Where the food at?
Oh, look who here? [chuckles]

27:48.208 --> 27:50.501
-[Williams] How you doing? [kisses]
-Hey, baby.

27:50.585 --> 27:52.462
-Hey, darling. How are you?
-Good, good.

27:52.545 --> 27:53.546
[Lillie] Good.

27:53.629 --> 27:55.506
[Williams]
I'm finna tear this chicken salad up.

27:55.590 --> 27:57.133
Okay. All right.

27:58.176 --> 28:00.971
[Williams] I'm finna get me
something to eat. Where the bread at?

28:01.679 --> 28:02.764
[Lillie] I got crackers.

28:02.847 --> 28:06.101
[Williams] Well... No, this fine.
I'll eat this and some cheese.

28:06.852 --> 28:09.062
Dang, this chicken salad really good.

28:09.562 --> 28:11.606
[Lillie] He really was a good child.

28:11.689 --> 28:14.943
He got into some mischief,
but nothing real bad.

28:15.026 --> 28:16.820
-What did you do, Davern?
-[Williams] Nothing.

28:16.903 --> 28:19.781
I graduated high school
and got a scholarship to Auburn.

28:19.865 --> 28:22.117
Oh, that's all he did then.
He graduated... No.

28:22.200 --> 28:23.785
It was more than that. It wasn't easy.

28:23.869 --> 28:27.622
You tell the truth, let the whole world
know that life is not that easy.

28:27.705 --> 28:30.041
But he's a great child,
he was a great son.

28:30.125 --> 28:32.961
-You told me to tell the truth.
-[chuckles] I didn't say nothin'.

28:33.044 --> 28:35.463
He told me to tell the truth,
and I mean, you know,

28:35.546 --> 28:37.883
ain't no life easy that I know of.

28:37.966 --> 28:40.468
I mean, I just...
I wasn't a football person.

28:40.551 --> 28:42.637
It was like, I didn't know
nothing about football.

28:42.721 --> 28:44.973
I wasn't a football...
I hated football, really.

28:45.056 --> 28:49.227
I just tried to push him
because I know he was a young black man,

28:49.310 --> 28:53.314
and he needed to be doing something
other than staying in the house.

28:53.982 --> 28:56.651
But knowing him, he's gonna...

28:56.735 --> 28:58.569
he's gonna move on up,
one way or the other.

28:58.653 --> 29:00.488
Bigger and better things.

29:00.571 --> 29:04.575
Whether East Mississippi is gonna be
the bigger, better thing, I don't know.

29:04.659 --> 29:06.912
I don't think he's let the school down.

29:06.995 --> 29:08.246
So far.

29:08.329 --> 29:10.832
I know he did more than 100%.

29:10.916 --> 29:13.835
'Cause he love that kinda stuff.
He love football.

29:13.919 --> 29:17.338
Can I tell you why he like football?
Can I tell them why you like football?

29:17.422 --> 29:18.757
I don't know why I like football.

29:18.840 --> 29:21.384
He can tell 'em what to do.
He can tell them boys what to do.

29:21.467 --> 29:22.510
[laughs] Whatever.

29:22.593 --> 29:25.180
He can't tell me and Erica,
that's my daughter, what to do.

29:25.263 --> 29:26.306
Whatever.

29:32.103 --> 29:35.941
[announcer]  Tonight,
Jeff Davis High School will commemorate

29:36.024 --> 29:40.737
the 20th anniversary
of the 1996 state championship team.

29:41.905 --> 29:43.990
Want me to get up
on your shoulders like I used to?

29:44.074 --> 29:45.533
[laughs]

29:46.367 --> 29:47.828
[indistinct chatter]

29:49.245 --> 29:50.330
[chuckling]

29:51.039 --> 29:52.707
I need these pictures after this.

29:52.791 --> 29:54.750
-What's up? You all right?
-[man] Good to see you.

29:54.835 --> 29:56.252
Man, you too. How you doing?

29:56.336 --> 29:58.629
-It all started right here.
-That's what I'm talking about.

29:58.713 --> 30:00.173
Hey, I'm trying to spread the love.

30:00.256 --> 30:01.967
-It started here.
-That's what I'm talking about.

30:02.050 --> 30:04.677
Shit, this my first championship,
right here, on this field.

30:05.636 --> 30:07.222
[coach]  All of the running in the summer,

30:07.305 --> 30:09.808
all of the lifting,
all of the getting chewed out...

30:09.891 --> 30:11.726
It's for days like this!

30:11.810 --> 30:13.478
What more do you want?

30:13.561 --> 30:16.481
The biggest game of the year,
right here, right now!

30:16.564 --> 30:19.650
You hit every fucking thing
with the opposite color jersey on.

30:19.734 --> 30:21.694
-[all cheering]
-That's what I want!

30:23.279 --> 30:24.280
[Williams] Hey, what's up?

30:24.364 --> 30:26.699
Man, y'all don't know me,
but I know y'all.

30:26.782 --> 30:27.826
-Okay?
-[player] D-Bo!

30:27.909 --> 30:33.164
My name is Davern Williams, all right?
And I wore that same uniform 20 years ago.

30:33.248 --> 30:36.126
Okay. Champion. It's in my blood.

30:36.209 --> 30:37.752
-You understand?
-[players] Yes, sir.

30:37.836 --> 30:39.170
[Williams] Thing about it is,

30:39.254 --> 30:40.922
sometimes you gotta have
a little dog in you. Okay?

30:41.006 --> 30:42.715
-[player 1] That's right.
-[player 2] Yes, sir.

30:42.798 --> 30:44.509
[Williams] "And what a dog is, Coach?"

30:44.592 --> 30:46.594
Dog is me lining up in front of you,
and saying,

30:46.677 --> 30:48.889
"You not finna kick my ass.
I'm finna kick yours."

30:48.972 --> 30:52.600
That's dog, okay?
Not willing to quit, son.

30:52.683 --> 30:55.770
You understand?
This, right here, this my first step.

30:55.854 --> 30:57.688
This my first level of being a dog.

30:58.606 --> 31:01.776
Okay? 1996 state championship ring.

31:01.860 --> 31:06.031
This ring right here led to this ring
right here, at Troy.

31:06.114 --> 31:07.782
Okay. Conference championship ring.

31:07.866 --> 31:11.786
This ring right here led to a ring
as I was coaching at Millsaps,

31:11.870 --> 31:13.496
conference championship, okay?

31:13.579 --> 31:15.081
This ring right here

31:15.165 --> 31:18.459
led to me a national championship
right here at East Mississippi.

31:18.543 --> 31:21.379
You understand?
So championship is in your blood!

31:21.462 --> 31:22.463
[player] Yes, sir!

31:22.547 --> 31:24.257
You take your ass out there
and get yours tonight.

31:24.340 --> 31:25.383
[cheering]

31:25.466 --> 31:27.218
Take your ass out there
and get yours!

31:27.302 --> 31:29.137
Hey! Hey! Hey!

31:30.055 --> 31:31.932
Hey! I got one more thing to say!

31:32.473 --> 31:34.392
I got one more thing to say!

31:34.475 --> 31:35.685
-We are...
-[players] J-D!

31:35.768 --> 31:36.811
-We are...
-[players] J-D!

31:36.895 --> 31:39.397
-Well, fucking act like it! Let's go!
-[cheering]

31:40.856 --> 31:42.858
Let's go, baby! Let's go! Let's go!

31:42.943 --> 31:44.152
[cheering]

31:47.238 --> 31:48.865
[all] Let's go, J-D!

31:51.743 --> 31:54.078
-[man] I can't hear you!
-[player] Let's go!

31:54.162 --> 31:56.664
Let's go, baby. Let's go. Let's go.
Let's go.

31:56.998 --> 31:58.666
[marching band playing]

32:01.336 --> 32:04.630
[Williams]  I would like to be
a Division I football coach.

32:04.714 --> 32:07.842
I recently just got my master's
in human development and leadership,

32:07.926 --> 32:11.012
and I feel like I have
some good leadership tools about myself

32:11.096 --> 32:14.057
that I would like to implement
and venture out and develop.

32:14.140 --> 32:15.850
But right now, you know,

32:15.934 --> 32:19.145
my focus is just on the ten guys
that I got to coach.

32:19.938 --> 32:21.564
[Williams speaking indistinctly]

32:22.607 --> 32:24.275
Get in the cold tub

32:24.359 --> 32:26.194
before I start making that
a rollable offense.

32:26.277 --> 32:28.696
[Maleke] What if you ate
a whole thing of mustard today?

32:28.779 --> 32:29.780
[Wilkerson] Whole thing of mustard?

32:29.864 --> 32:31.532
I don't have to get
in the cold tub, 'cause it's--

32:31.616 --> 32:33.909
-No, that doesn't make a difference.
-Yes, it do.

32:33.994 --> 32:38.581
What if you ate a whole thing of mustard
and ate a sandwich with mustard on it?

32:40.208 --> 32:42.460
-Man, get in the cold tub.
-Man, Coach, I'm...

32:42.543 --> 32:44.045
I'm catching a cold already, Coach.

32:44.129 --> 32:46.214
I ain't worried, we got medicine for that.

32:46.297 --> 32:48.508
-Damned if I be--
-[Williams] Get in that cold tub.

32:49.175 --> 32:52.387
[player] What the fuck, dude?
Excuse my language, this is cold.

32:54.889 --> 32:56.141
Oh, my God!

32:56.224 --> 32:58.893
-[Kam] Man, I don't need this shit.
-[Williams] Get in the tub.

32:58.977 --> 33:00.728
-Get in the tub.
-[Kam] Damn. Why?

33:01.312 --> 33:03.064
-Let's go. Get in the tub.
-Chill, Coach.

33:03.148 --> 33:04.232
You got a tub by yourself.

33:04.315 --> 33:05.316
-Get in the tub.
-But why?

33:05.400 --> 33:07.402
-All the way in the damn tub.
-Why?

33:08.236 --> 33:10.655
-Put your cleats down and get in.
-Why do I have to get in?

33:10.738 --> 33:12.907
-For what, Coach?
-So you can play Thursday.

33:12.991 --> 33:14.909
But I always play and I never get in this.

33:14.993 --> 33:17.412
Well, you ain't playing this Thursday
if you don't get in.

33:17.495 --> 33:19.247
-Why?
-Yeah, this ain't...

33:19.330 --> 33:21.082
This ain't a place where you do
what you wanna do.

33:21.166 --> 33:22.375
Get in the damn tub.

33:22.458 --> 33:24.002
-It's for your benefit.
-Why you gotta be like that?

33:24.419 --> 33:25.836
Why  you  gotta be like that?

33:26.421 --> 33:27.838
This shit don't benefit me.

33:28.839 --> 33:31.342
This ain't about me.
This about a power thing.

33:31.426 --> 33:33.636
Why you being so damn difficult, man?

33:33.719 --> 33:36.014
-'Cause this shit don't--
-Sit in the tub!

33:36.097 --> 33:38.849
Sit down in the tub!
It ain't even that damn cold.

33:38.933 --> 33:40.768
-It is cold.
-No, it ain't. Sit down!

33:40.851 --> 33:42.895
It hurts. All right.

33:42.978 --> 33:45.273
-No. No, no, no, no.
-Coach, chill. I don't wanna get in.

33:45.356 --> 33:46.524
[Williams] Well, you gotta.

33:46.607 --> 33:47.692
-Sit down.
-[Kam] Why?

33:47.775 --> 33:49.694
-[Williams] Sit down.
-Why?

33:49.777 --> 33:51.862
What'd he say? What'd he say?
What'd he say?

33:51.946 --> 33:54.657
-[player] Then he ain't get in Thursday.
-There you go. There you go.

33:55.325 --> 33:56.784
[Kam] Coach, that shit hurt.

33:56.867 --> 33:59.412
And you gonna hurt the team,
'cause you ain't playing on Thursday.

33:59.495 --> 34:01.789
All because you being
fucking selfish right now.

34:02.373 --> 34:05.210
-[chanting] Kam! Kam!
-Man...

34:05.293 --> 34:06.961
Kam, get in there, at least 30 seconds.

34:07.045 --> 34:08.963
-It ain't gonna be long.
-Ten seconds?

34:09.047 --> 34:11.299
[Brian] Y'all just wanna push his ass in,
bro?

34:15.178 --> 34:16.179
[smacks lips]

34:16.262 --> 34:18.431
-[Kam] Man... [groans]
-[player] Man, bro...

34:19.099 --> 34:20.975
-Am I done?
-[Williams] No.

34:21.059 --> 34:22.185
Put your legs in the tub.

34:22.268 --> 34:23.603
They are, Coach.

34:25.063 --> 34:26.272
They in there.

34:27.273 --> 34:28.649
Coach, I know that's it.

34:30.401 --> 34:32.362
-That's done?
-[Williams] Your shorts not wet.

34:32.445 --> 34:33.362
[Kam] They are.

34:34.072 --> 34:36.366
Coach, my shorts are wet. [groans]

34:36.449 --> 34:38.076
[Williams] All right.
We'll handle it on Thursday.

34:38.159 --> 34:39.369
[Kam] I got in!

34:39.452 --> 34:41.121
We know
what you ain't gonna be getting in.

34:42.497 --> 34:43.706
All right, Coach.

34:48.961 --> 34:50.921
[Kam]  They're trying to keep me down.

34:51.005 --> 34:53.341
[Wagner] You know what?
If you wanna play, at some point,

34:53.424 --> 34:55.468
you're gonna decide to follow the rules.

34:55.551 --> 34:56.928
I'm not in charge of Coach Williams.

34:57.011 --> 34:59.680
I just know that if he wants you
to get in the ice bath,

34:59.764 --> 35:01.349
then you need to get in the ice bath.

35:01.432 --> 35:05.853
Man, fuck that shit.
That shit made me mad. I wanna go home.

35:07.772 --> 35:11.359
[Wagner]  You know, I think Kam is probably
the hardest case for me to deal with.

35:11.442 --> 35:14.028
I mean, there's some things
that he can't help.

35:14.112 --> 35:15.738
I mean, some things that he was born into,

35:15.821 --> 35:17.907
and he was behind the eight ball
from the beginning,

35:17.990 --> 35:21.744
so I wanna root for him
and, like, I wanna help him.

35:21.827 --> 35:24.539
But he kind of makes it hard.

35:24.622 --> 35:27.208
I think he's trying to prove
that he's good enough.

35:27.292 --> 35:31.796
Like, trying to prove that he's a man.
He clearly wants the guys to like him.

35:31.879 --> 35:35.049
Like, he wants to be
a strong member of this team,

35:35.133 --> 35:37.718
and I don't think he ever
got there at Penn State.

35:37.802 --> 35:40.638
And I don't think he's getting there here.

35:41.472 --> 35:44.058
And I hate that. Because to me, like...

35:44.892 --> 35:50.231
when you want that so badly
and you're trying to connect with people,

35:50.315 --> 35:51.857
and it's not working...

35:53.401 --> 35:58.531
You know,
I think, internally, that is devastating.

36:00.616 --> 36:02.326
[Wood] Ready! Down!

36:02.827 --> 36:04.287
Stretch, stretch, stretch.

36:04.995 --> 36:07.415
Coach Dunbar said
they was offering me soon.

36:07.498 --> 36:09.167
-[player] From Arizona?
-Huh?

36:09.250 --> 36:10.501
[both] Alabama.

36:10.585 --> 36:12.670
I could go somewhere
and play quarterback. [sighs]

36:12.753 --> 36:14.672
It's a wrap for them quarterback days.

36:14.922 --> 36:16.591
-Nigga, I still could throw.
-You're 290.

36:16.674 --> 36:18.593
-I'm just too fat.
-Yeah.

36:18.676 --> 36:20.345
I got the legs for it, though.

36:22.012 --> 36:23.681
[Williams] We got a shutout last week.

36:23.764 --> 36:26.016
I'm telling you guys,
there is nothing different

36:26.100 --> 36:28.936
than what we've been doing,
and how we've been lining up,

36:29.019 --> 36:30.396
besides y'all guys' focus.

36:30.480 --> 36:34.024
'Cause any little mistake that we make,
it could cost us during this time.

36:34.108 --> 36:35.443
[Wood] Understand what's at stake.

36:35.526 --> 36:37.362
You trying for the ring
we're trying to get,

36:37.445 --> 36:39.280
which is that state title ring, okay?

36:39.364 --> 36:40.365
That's what you're working to get.

36:40.448 --> 36:42.533
You are one game away
from playing for that thing.

36:42.617 --> 36:44.076
Make sure we're locked in all week.

36:44.159 --> 36:46.412
Understand what I'm talking about?
Touch somebody.

36:46.496 --> 36:48.873
[player] Dominate on three!
Dominate on me!

36:48.956 --> 36:50.625
-One, two, three...
-[players] Dominate!

36:50.708 --> 36:53.043
[Williams] We got a walkthrough at 6:15.

36:53.127 --> 36:55.546
Who got class tonight?
All right, Kam, you got class tonight.

36:55.630 --> 36:58.466
-[Kam] I dropped that shit.
-[Williams] You didn't. You did not drop.

36:58.549 --> 37:01.386
You going to class.
You can't drop a class by yourself, son.

37:01.469 --> 37:02.470
[Kam] I talked to him--

37:02.553 --> 37:04.179
[Williams] Nah. You ain't God.
Go to class.

37:04.264 --> 37:05.265
[Kam] I don't got class.

37:05.348 --> 37:08.309
[Williams] I'm telling you, you gotta go
to fucking class, son.

37:08.393 --> 37:09.769
-You got class!
-[Kam] Hey, relax.

37:09.852 --> 37:11.729
[Williams] You tell me to fucking relax?

37:11.812 --> 37:14.064
Who you telling to relax?
You ain't telling me to relax.

37:14.148 --> 37:15.650
You gonna take your ass to class, boy.

37:15.733 --> 37:17.568
-[Ed Holly] Walk away.
-[Williams] Take your ass...

37:17.652 --> 37:19.987
-[Kam] Back off.
-[Williams] That's how it's gonna be?

37:20.070 --> 37:21.489
-[Kam] Yeah.
-[Williams] Get off this field.

37:21.572 --> 37:23.574
-[Ed Holly] Walk away.
-[Kam] What the fuck wrong with you?

37:23.658 --> 37:25.410
[Williams] I don't have to tell you
what the fuck wrong with me!

37:25.493 --> 37:27.912
-Get your ass off the field.
-[Trickett] Remember why you're here.

37:27.995 --> 37:30.581
[Kam] This nigga been trying me
all fucking day, bro.

37:30.665 --> 37:32.124
What the fuck wrong with this nigga?

37:32.207 --> 37:35.002
[Trickett] That's your coach.
You understand that? That's your coach.

37:35.085 --> 37:36.796
This nigga acting like I'm a bitch. Fuck.

37:36.879 --> 37:39.590
Why are you here?
You're here for something else.

37:39.674 --> 37:42.092
-Not to take no bullshit.
-Yeah, well, that's your coach.

37:42.176 --> 37:45.012
Shit's gonna happen. Listen to him.
Listen to what he says. Come on.

37:45.095 --> 37:47.348
-You gotta go to class.
-[Williams] Go to class, son.

37:47.432 --> 37:50.225
You got class!
You did not drop that class!

37:50.310 --> 37:51.185
[Kam] I talked to...

37:51.269 --> 37:53.771
[Williams] You did not drop that class!
You got class!

37:53.854 --> 37:55.856
-[Kam] I'm talking to Coach Trickett.
-I'm talking to you!

37:55.940 --> 37:57.400
You don't talk to him
when he talks to you.

37:57.483 --> 37:58.526
He's your coach.

37:58.609 --> 38:01.779
You finna' go to class,
or you gotta pack your shit and go home!

38:01.862 --> 38:03.072
[Jay] I say we all...

38:05.491 --> 38:07.868
[players chattering indistinctly]

38:07.952 --> 38:09.203
[Jackson] Who was that?

38:09.287 --> 38:10.955
[Williams] Somebody you don't want.

38:11.497 --> 38:13.291
[Jackson] That's why I wanna know.

38:13.374 --> 38:16.294
-Kam Carter. You do not want him.
-Yeah. Yeah.

38:16.877 --> 38:18.421
[Williams] Pulling some stunt like that.

38:19.171 --> 38:21.632
-[Wagner] What'd you do?
-Pushed Coach Williams.

38:21.716 --> 38:23.175
-[Wagner] Pushed Coach Williams?
-Yeah.

38:23.258 --> 38:24.969
He all up in my face and stuff.

38:25.052 --> 38:27.555
-[Jay] Mm-mmm. Hey, hey.
-[Kam] All I'm saying--

38:27.638 --> 38:31.225
Shut up. I ain't trying to hear you,
'cause what you did,

38:31.309 --> 38:32.935
you know damn well you was wrong.

38:33.018 --> 38:34.645
[Kam] Don't walk up on me. What the fuck?

38:34.729 --> 38:38.607
[Jay] That's your fucking coach.
I'mma need him before he need me.

38:39.191 --> 38:40.192
Mm-hmm.

38:40.275 --> 38:41.986
And you think you got
offers and shit. See--

38:42.069 --> 38:43.821
-[Kam] I do.
-[Jay] Let's see where the offers go.

38:43.904 --> 38:45.365
How long you gonna have 'em?

38:45.448 --> 38:47.325
I'm gonna tell you what Coach
gonna do to him.

38:47.408 --> 38:49.243
And Netflix, we gonna... Hey!

38:49.327 --> 38:53.664
In June, we're gonna see
this dude right here, nowhere.

38:53.748 --> 38:56.417
-Back in Maryland.
-[Kam] Sound good.

38:56.501 --> 38:58.836
Won't be playing no ball,
unless he go D-III.

38:58.919 --> 39:01.171
-[Kam] Sound good.
-[Jay] You barely can make it JUCO.

39:01.255 --> 39:03.090
You fucking ass, Kam.

39:03.173 --> 39:04.425
[Kam] I belong at 'Bama.

39:04.508 --> 39:09.805
You belong at 'Bama. Yeah, your height
and size belong at 'Bama, but you don't.

39:14.894 --> 39:17.522
[Wood]  You are one game away
from a state championship.

39:17.605 --> 39:18.773
Just one.

39:18.856 --> 39:21.692
There's only two rounds in the postseason
in junior colleges, okay?

39:21.776 --> 39:26.030
So you're one game away.
The time for freshman players is done.

39:26.113 --> 39:27.407
We don't have any anymore.

39:27.490 --> 39:29.950
Everything that you've worked for
is right at hand.

39:30.034 --> 39:33.788
But you have to get through this one
in order to play the next one.

39:34.288 --> 39:37.291
Survive and advance. Win and advance.

39:37.792 --> 39:39.794
If it doesn't go your way, you're done.

39:39.877 --> 39:42.963
Everybody runs faster.
Everybody hits harder.

39:43.047 --> 39:44.924
But the mistakes are magnified.

39:45.007 --> 39:47.176
[Williams]
If we end up beating Gulf Coast,

39:47.259 --> 39:50.555
and then you sure enough setting up
for a showdown. Okay?

39:50.638 --> 39:53.057
So this time of year,
this playoff deal, man,

39:53.140 --> 39:55.309
them boys finna put everybody
on the line of scrimmage

39:55.393 --> 39:58.145
and try to pound the ball
down your throat.

39:58.228 --> 39:59.439
[Ed Holly]  When the work is done...

40:00.398 --> 40:02.357
you get to go out there
and just play and have fun

40:02.442 --> 40:05.069
and do what you came
to Scooba, Mississippi for.

40:05.152 --> 40:06.487
To win the state championship.

40:07.237 --> 40:09.073
-[coach]  Go!
-[Isaiah grunting]

40:14.036 --> 40:15.871
-Come up.
-You sound like you're in pain.

40:15.955 --> 40:16.956
-I am.
-[Ezsmone chuckles]

40:17.915 --> 40:19.291
[coach] That's better.

40:19.375 --> 40:22.253
[Wagner]  Everyone thinks he's faking it
and he doesn't wanna practice,

40:22.336 --> 40:25.506
and the trainer's caught in the middle
in all this, and, you know...

40:25.590 --> 40:29.927
"Is he injured? And is it an injury
where they think he should play?"

40:30.010 --> 40:32.722
You know, I think that happens
all the time in college athletics.

40:32.805 --> 40:36.601
Coaches are like, "Well, it's not
a severe injury. You can play through it."

40:36.684 --> 40:38.519
And then if you don't,
you're not tough enough.

40:38.603 --> 40:39.812
You're not a man.

40:39.895 --> 40:41.021
-[Ezsmone] He gotta do that.
-[trainer] Come on,

40:41.105 --> 40:42.189
I need bigger mountain climbers.

40:42.272 --> 40:44.442
-[Isaiah] I can't.
-[Ezsmone] He can't with one foot.

40:44.525 --> 40:46.110
[trainer] Well, do whatever you can.

40:46.193 --> 40:48.779
[Wagner]  If he says it's too painful,
it's too painful.

40:48.863 --> 40:50.114
It doesn't make him weak.

40:50.197 --> 40:52.992
It doesn't make him lazy.
It makes him hurt.

40:53.075 --> 40:56.454
If you're hurt, you can't get practice
if you're wearing a black jersey.

40:57.037 --> 40:59.790
So change them out
if you're practicing today.

40:59.874 --> 41:01.709
-Wait a minute.
-[indistinct chatter]

41:01.792 --> 41:03.836
Oh, I'm good. I'm fine.

41:04.587 --> 41:05.963
[Wagner]  Isaiah's career is...

41:06.046 --> 41:08.466
hopefully gonna be a lot longer
than East Mississippi.

41:08.549 --> 41:12.595
He risks ending it if he continues to play
through something...

41:13.971 --> 41:15.765
that could damage him further.

41:15.848 --> 41:18.058
-[player grunts]
-[Isaiah] Oh!

41:18.934 --> 41:20.686
-[Wood] Do it again.
-[Isaiah] I can't.

41:20.770 --> 41:22.146
[Wood] Do it again. Let's go.

41:22.855 --> 41:24.940
Ba-ba-ba-ba-bitch.

41:25.900 --> 41:27.818
[Buddy]  Tell me about
the Kam thing yesterday.

41:27.902 --> 41:29.987
I didn't know about it.
Found out a while ago.

41:30.070 --> 41:32.907
Don't know the whole story.
I really don't know the whole story.

41:32.990 --> 41:34.074
I don't.

41:34.158 --> 41:36.243
He said something about,
uh, they got into a...

41:36.326 --> 41:38.162
-You on?
-Yeah.

41:38.871 --> 41:39.872
[microphone clicks]

41:41.123 --> 41:42.374
-I heard--
-[microphone shuts off]

41:42.457 --> 41:43.458
[inaudible]

41:44.752 --> 41:46.170
-[Buddy] Hey, Kam!
-How you doing?

41:46.253 --> 41:47.672
-[player] Kam.
-[Buddy] Come here.

41:50.716 --> 41:53.260
[Buddy] Kam, I love you to death.
Don't you understand?

41:53.928 --> 41:57.848
I mean, I'd do anything for you, okay?

41:58.683 --> 42:01.936
And you and I have talked about
your struggles before.

42:02.019 --> 42:06.190
But I'm just telling you now,
hey, you've got to learn.

42:06.273 --> 42:08.693
You've got to learn when enough's enough.

42:08.776 --> 42:12.863
Look, I'm the first one to say
I'm not perfect.

42:12.947 --> 42:15.240
I have problems with my temper
all the time.

42:15.324 --> 42:16.325
-You know?
-Yes, sir.

42:16.408 --> 42:21.706
But you got to take care of controlling
your emotions too, you know?

42:21.789 --> 42:26.711
And I'm telling you the way to do that
is to walk away from certain situations.

42:26.794 --> 42:30.881
Stop, count, pray, whatever you got to do,
and I need you to do this.

42:30.965 --> 42:35.636
I need you and Coach Williams
to sit down and talk, okay?

42:35.720 --> 42:37.054
-[Kam] Mm-hmm.
-[Buddy] Understand? Fix that.

42:37.137 --> 42:39.682
-[Buddy] Fix that situation, understand?
-[Kam] Yes, sir.

42:39.765 --> 42:42.226
-[Buddy] Fix it today, understand?
-Mm-hmm. Yes, sir.

42:42.309 --> 42:43.435
-[Buddy] All right. I love you.
-I love you.

42:43.518 --> 42:45.563
-Hey, listen, just take it, please.
-Yes, sir.

42:45.646 --> 42:46.814
-Please.
-I will.

42:47.565 --> 42:49.149
[Wood] Same call, same call!

42:51.401 --> 42:54.697
Hey, hey, Isaiah!
I can't half-ass it now. Let's go!

42:54.780 --> 42:56.198
[grunting]

42:57.282 --> 43:00.202
-No! Hey! Isaiah!
-[Isaiah groans]

43:00.285 --> 43:01.495
[Wood] He's down.

43:01.579 --> 43:03.205
[Isaiah screaming]

43:04.582 --> 43:07.126
Oh, my God, bro.

43:07.209 --> 43:09.920
Oh, bro, he hit me dead in my ankle, man.

43:11.046 --> 43:12.047
[Isaiah groans]

43:13.674 --> 43:17.011
[Wood] All right, next back in, let's go.
Go, Horsley, go. Here we go.

43:17.762 --> 43:21.015
He literally full out hit me
dead in my ankle, dog.

43:22.432 --> 43:23.517
[Isaiah groans]

43:25.435 --> 43:27.271
-You all right?
-[Isaiah] I don't know.

43:28.689 --> 43:29.940
Oh, God.

43:31.441 --> 43:32.442
[Buddy] What's wrong with Isaiah?

43:32.526 --> 43:35.195
[Isaiah] No, man.
He hit me dead in my ankle.

43:35.279 --> 43:36.906
-[Buddy] Did he?
-[Isaiah] Yes.

43:36.989 --> 43:39.033
[Buddy] Don't you lay on the ground
and whine.

43:39.116 --> 43:40.284
-Understand?
-[Isaiah] You don't understand.

43:40.367 --> 43:41.702
-[Isaiah] I got you.
-[Buddy] Go, go, go.

43:42.620 --> 43:43.829
Finish the day.

43:45.330 --> 43:48.959
[Buddy] He has no idea how good he can be.

43:49.043 --> 43:52.421
He also has no idea
how he's acting, you know?

43:52.504 --> 43:53.923
He has no idea.

43:55.507 --> 43:58.218
'Cause of the sympathy
that Ollie got last year.

43:58.302 --> 44:00.971
[Buddy] Ollie got the sympathy vote.
Now he's gonna get the sympathy vote.

44:01.055 --> 44:03.515
[Buddy] He's gonna go through life
having the sympathy vote.

44:03.599 --> 44:06.143
-[whistle blowing]
-[Buddy] Everybody up, let's go.

44:06.644 --> 44:10.105
I need everybody healthy
for this ball game, okay?

44:10.648 --> 44:13.651
So if you need treatment,
get treatment, okay?

44:14.068 --> 44:16.487
I want to remind you of one thing, okay?

44:16.570 --> 44:20.616
Y'all are great athletes,
you're really good football players, okay?

44:21.241 --> 44:22.242
You got a lot in front of you.

44:23.410 --> 44:26.664
Don't pose coming out here
to practice, okay?

44:26.747 --> 44:29.458
Come out here and get on a mission.
We're not trying to be posers.

44:30.125 --> 44:32.169
-All right? You got me, we good?
-[players] Yes, sir.

44:32.252 --> 44:34.672
That's awesome. All right, any...
Coaches, we got anything?

44:34.755 --> 44:36.256
-We got cold tubs today?
-[coach] Yes.

44:36.340 --> 44:38.884
[chuckles] Hey, all right.
Cold tubs, all right.

44:39.259 --> 44:41.846
That's great. All right. Huh?

44:41.929 --> 44:44.848
-[Wood]  How's that sprain?
-[Isaiah]  I mean, it's fine.

44:44.932 --> 44:46.183
I rolled it, I think.

44:46.684 --> 44:48.978
'Cause I was trying to stop
but I was falling.

44:49.061 --> 44:50.187
I went in the, uh...

44:50.270 --> 44:51.396
-Bucket?
-Bucket, yeah.

44:52.106 --> 44:53.232
But I'm fine.

44:53.315 --> 44:54.524
-Okay.
-I just rolled it.

44:55.442 --> 44:58.028
[Isaiah]  You have your days with coaches.
You have 'em.

44:58.112 --> 44:59.780
You'll be able to see the fake in people.

44:59.864 --> 45:01.031
You'll be able to see the real,

45:01.115 --> 45:03.367
you'll be able to see
what they wanted you to see

45:03.450 --> 45:05.786
or what they trying to have you see.

45:05.870 --> 45:09.289
Once you get that
one indicator that's like,

45:09.373 --> 45:11.709
"Oh, he trying to use you.
He just using you."

45:12.334 --> 45:15.545
That breaks all the trust.
That breaks it all.

45:15.629 --> 45:17.714
You can act like you...

45:17.798 --> 45:21.718
you helping me and everything,
but the end of the day, I know you're not.

45:22.386 --> 45:24.513
I know... I can... I know.

45:28.225 --> 45:29.852
[Kam] I could holla at you?

45:30.811 --> 45:32.104
Not really.

45:32.187 --> 45:34.815
Coach Stephens told me
I had to talk to you today, so...

45:35.899 --> 45:37.693
[Williams] Well,
I ain't ready to talk to you.

45:41.321 --> 45:43.073
[Williams]  When you fight for somebody

45:43.157 --> 45:47.787
and you fight to teach and mold,
encourage and support somebody

45:48.370 --> 45:51.415
and you feel like
it's goin' unappreciated,

45:51.498 --> 45:55.377
or you feel like someone is not listening,
then that's all I can do.

45:56.003 --> 45:57.004
[Kam]  I shouldn't have,

45:57.087 --> 46:00.757
I mean, pushed him or whatever,
but you know what I mean...

46:00.841 --> 46:04.929
He gotta respect me.
He need to learn to respect me as a man.

46:05.595 --> 46:07.764
Now that I've sat back
and looked at the situation,

46:07.848 --> 46:10.184
I probably would've ignored him
and walked away-type shit,

46:10.267 --> 46:12.727
but that's about living and learning,
basically.

46:13.270 --> 46:14.772
Hell yeah, that's why we here.

46:15.522 --> 46:17.024
[Williams]  At some point in time...

46:17.607 --> 46:19.193
as a young man, as a person...

46:20.027 --> 46:24.781
you're gonna have to take ownership
of the things that you do...

46:25.365 --> 46:27.034
and the things that you say.

46:27.117 --> 46:30.329
And the things that's in your life
that distracts you.

46:31.038 --> 46:33.457
You're gonna have to take ownership
of those things.

46:33.540 --> 46:35.417
I've done all I can do with Kam.

46:35.960 --> 46:38.378
And I hope he gets an opportunity
in the near future

46:38.462 --> 46:39.796
to go on to the next level...

46:40.380 --> 46:43.425
But that's all I can say about that.

46:54.811 --> 46:56.271
[crowd cheering]

46:57.147 --> 46:59.942
[Crowder]  Good afternoon and welcome
to Sullivan-Windham Field

47:00.025 --> 47:02.236
where it is the first round
of the playoffs.

47:02.319 --> 47:06.615
EMCC taking on Mississippi Gulf Coast,
a team it played earlier this season.

47:06.698 --> 47:08.200
Doesn't matter what you've done so far,

47:08.283 --> 47:09.826
you've got to win today.

47:09.910 --> 47:11.286
[Beard]  There is no tomorrow.

47:11.370 --> 47:15.165
Loser stays home. The winner advances
to the state championship.

47:15.249 --> 47:18.252
[Isaiah] It's time to turn that shit up!
Let's go!

47:19.586 --> 47:21.171
[Crowder]
Mississippi Gulf Coast will kick it.

47:21.255 --> 47:24.591
Joshua Rowland comes up on the football
and he's gonna squib it.

47:24.674 --> 47:27.011
And it's an onside kick
and there's a scramble for it.

47:27.094 --> 47:29.179
And I believe EMCC is going to fall on it.

47:29.263 --> 47:30.847
You know they're beat
when they come out like that.

47:30.931 --> 47:32.516
You know they're done
when they're coming out like that.

47:32.599 --> 47:34.101
Hey, y'all niggas dumb as fuck.

47:34.184 --> 47:35.810
You know they're done
when they're doing that.

47:35.895 --> 47:37.104
-Right over, 22-Seam.
-[player] Y'all dumb!

47:37.187 --> 47:38.605
[Wood]  Right over, 22-Seam. Let's go!

47:38.688 --> 47:41.066
[Crowder]  In the shotgun,
it's gonna be De'Andre Johnson.

47:41.150 --> 47:42.943
-Twins to the left.
-[De'Andre] Rush!

47:43.027 --> 47:45.529
[Crowder]  It's a play action,
firing it to Shannon near side.

47:45.612 --> 47:47.697
And he's gonna go inside the 30,
on the near sidelines

47:47.781 --> 47:49.574
and he's out of bounds
at the 22-yard line.

47:49.658 --> 47:51.785
[Buddy] Attababy! Attababy!

47:52.369 --> 47:54.163
Let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go.

47:54.246 --> 47:57.457
[Crowder]  EMCC in Gulf Coast territory
on the first drive of this ball game.

47:57.541 --> 47:58.542
[Buddy] Four-man front.

47:58.625 --> 48:01.586
Aw, we got a little razzle dazzle up here
when we go in.

48:01.670 --> 48:03.505
[Crowder]  Boy,
they're showing some pressure

48:03.588 --> 48:04.965
as they've got those linebackers
creeped up.

48:05.049 --> 48:06.550
Everybody's standing up
at the line of scrimmage.

48:06.633 --> 48:08.385
Inside pressure,
they hit De'Andre Johnson

48:08.468 --> 48:10.345
and sack him back at the 30-yard line.

48:11.263 --> 48:14.349
[Devaunya] How the hell do you get sacked
on the damn second play of the game?

48:14.433 --> 48:17.727
[Buddy] Fast, fast, fast, fast! Hurry up!

48:18.728 --> 48:21.273
[Crowder]  They're showing pressure.
EMCC picks 'em up.

48:21.356 --> 48:22.649
They fire it over the middle.
He has Shannon open.

48:22.732 --> 48:24.443
Caught it at the 5.
He rolls towards the end zone.

48:24.526 --> 48:26.236
-Touchdown, EMCC!
-[Isaiah] Oh, yeah!

48:26.320 --> 48:27.947
Man up, baby! Man that shit up!

48:28.030 --> 48:29.698
-[Wood] Hey, good job!
-Man that shit up!

48:29.781 --> 48:30.782
[Isaiah] Yeah!

48:30.865 --> 48:33.368
[Winfield]  De'Andre Johnson
did what you are supposed to do.

48:33.452 --> 48:36.496
You throw where the pressure came from
and he found the open man.

48:36.580 --> 48:37.581
[Ed Holly] Lock in.

48:37.664 --> 48:40.125
We're gonna play
the greatest defense created by man,

48:40.209 --> 48:41.918
31-2 to start this sucker off.

48:42.002 --> 48:44.379
[Winfield]  We'll get a look
at East Mississippi's defense.

48:44.463 --> 48:46.131
We'll see if they can answer the call.

48:46.215 --> 48:49.009
[Crowder]  Here's the snap to Sisson.
He's gonna hand it to his fullback.

48:49.093 --> 48:51.011
Little trickeration on the flea flicker.

48:51.095 --> 48:53.013
Sisson throws it down the field,
has a man open...

48:53.097 --> 48:54.848
but it's taken away by EMCC!

48:54.931 --> 48:57.351
-[Devaunya] Way to go, D!
-[De'Andre] Good job, D!

48:57.434 --> 49:00.187
[Crowder]  Oh, man,
what a play by Duke Upshaw!

49:00.270 --> 49:02.772
[Winfield]  This Lions' defense playing
with a lot of confidence.

49:02.856 --> 49:08.988
Hey, be goddarn physical now, damn it!
Let's go! Hey, hey, hey! Be physical!

49:09.571 --> 49:11.198
[Crowder]  De'Andre Johnson in the shotgun.

49:11.281 --> 49:12.949
He'll have Wright flanked to his right,

49:13.033 --> 49:15.035
nursing an ankle injury, we believe.

49:15.119 --> 49:17.662
They hand it off to Wright,
tries to run left side. He can't make it.

49:17.746 --> 49:19.498
He's stopped
behind the line of scrimmage.

49:19.581 --> 49:21.000
[Winfield]  You can tell
they are bringing pressure

49:21.083 --> 49:22.626
from everywhere here today.

49:22.709 --> 49:24.211
-[Isaiah] Bro...
-[De'Andre] Come on!

49:24.294 --> 49:25.504
Okay, let's go, let's go!

49:25.587 --> 49:27.047
-One down, let's go!
-[Isaiah] I can't move!

49:27.131 --> 49:28.507
[De'Andre] You had the hole, man!

49:28.590 --> 49:31.551
Isaiah, quit damn tippy-toeing around.

49:31.635 --> 49:33.720
It's two yards, that's all you gotta get!

49:33.803 --> 49:36.473
Hey! Either run it or don't
and get somebody else in there!

49:36.556 --> 49:38.475
I don't care! Get two yards!

49:38.558 --> 49:42.062
[Winfield]  Gulf Coast really giving
East Mississippi fits defensively,

49:42.146 --> 49:44.564
but East Mississippi doing a good job
defensively, too.

49:44.648 --> 49:45.940
Let's see how they bring the pressure.

49:46.025 --> 49:48.568
[Crowder]  Here's the snap.
Mississippi Gulf Coast looking right side

49:48.652 --> 49:50.654
and floats it high
and it's caught over his shoulder...

49:50.737 --> 49:53.490
-20, 15, 10, 5, touchdown!
-[Buddy] Who's got the running back?

49:54.324 --> 49:56.493
[De'Andre] That's all right, let's go!
We're gonna score.

49:56.576 --> 49:58.037
We gotta score, we're gonna score.

49:58.120 --> 50:01.081
[Crowder]  Mississippi Gulf Coast
from 40 yards out,

50:01.165 --> 50:02.999
and it's 7-7, here in the second quarter.

50:03.083 --> 50:04.126
[Chauncey] Wrap their ass up!

50:04.209 --> 50:06.920
Every time you put a hat on somebody,
wrap their ass up.

50:07.003 --> 50:09.048
We better than they motherfuckin' ass,
just wrap up!

50:09.131 --> 50:12.426
[De'Andre] We worked too hard
to let this be our last game.

50:12.926 --> 50:17.181
All right, let's get off our ass.
Let's bring this dog out of us, all right?

50:17.264 --> 50:20.059
-[player] All right.
-Let's whoop they ass. I'm not losing.

50:20.142 --> 50:23.270
[Crowder]  Empty set for De'Andre Johnson
and this offense.

50:23.353 --> 50:24.563
They'll bring pressure from up the middle.

50:24.646 --> 50:26.565
They hit De'Andre Johnson.
He spins out of the tackle.

50:26.648 --> 50:29.401
Rolls to his right,
and he's gonna have a first down. Wow.

50:29.484 --> 50:32.154
Marcus, you're gonna get
the quarterback fuckin' killed.

50:32.237 --> 50:35.532
You're gonna get the quarterback killed
by going fucking empty!

50:35.615 --> 50:36.825
Stay out of it!

50:36.908 --> 50:40.287
[Winfield]  They went empty set that time
and no back in to block

50:40.370 --> 50:41.580
and he took a big hit.

50:41.663 --> 50:44.083
But just wasn't knocked down.
He didn't lose his composure.

50:44.166 --> 50:46.000
[Crowder]  Here's the snap to Johnson,
back to pass.

50:46.085 --> 50:47.252
Inside pressure, he steps up.

50:47.336 --> 50:48.462
Can't avoid the second guy,

50:48.545 --> 50:50.046
-and he's sacked back at the 42.
-[Buddy] Marcus.

50:50.130 --> 50:52.048
[Crowder]  Mississippi Gulf Coast trying
to bring in delayed blitzes.

50:52.132 --> 50:53.425
Jesus Christ.

50:53.508 --> 50:55.635
[Crowder]  Throwing the kitchen sink
at EMCC defensively.

50:55.719 --> 50:58.597
God damn it!
You're killing our quarterback.

50:58.680 --> 50:59.806
You're fucking killing him.

50:59.889 --> 51:01.141
[Winfield]  We've got a better game

51:01.225 --> 51:02.767
than what we thought we would have.

51:02.851 --> 51:04.686
Not a lot has happened
after that opening-drive touchdown

51:04.769 --> 51:05.979
for East Mississippi.

51:06.062 --> 51:08.398
Let's go! Let's go, let's go!

51:08.982 --> 51:11.235
[Crowder]  Here's the snap at the waist,
back to pass,

51:11.318 --> 51:13.027
plenty of time,
fires it deep over the middle

51:13.112 --> 51:14.863
and it is caught! Touchdown, EMCC!

51:14.946 --> 51:17.073
-Come on, bitch! Hell yeah!
-Great job!

51:17.157 --> 51:20.076
[Winfield]  What a job of bouncing back
by Johnson. Made it look easy.

51:20.160 --> 51:22.662
[Crowder]  Forty-yard touchdown pass
to take a 14-7 lead.

51:22.746 --> 51:24.706
[Isaiah] I got you, Dre! I got you!

51:24.789 --> 51:26.333
[De'Andre] I told you.

51:26.416 --> 51:29.378
I told you, bro, didn't I?
Fucking man. Man they ass up.

51:29.461 --> 51:30.754
[Winfield]
If you're going to bring pressure,

51:30.837 --> 51:33.132
you better get to Johnson
because he can do damage.

51:33.215 --> 51:35.467
Come here!
Stand your ass right here.

51:35.550 --> 51:37.719
-Block the damn defensive end!
-[player] Yes, sir.

51:37.802 --> 51:40.389
[Buddy] Come off and hit him
or I'll pull your ass out.

51:40.472 --> 51:43.558
Everything that we practiced,
they're doing right now to a tee.

51:43.642 --> 51:45.935
[Buddy] Damn it! Play for your brother!
Let's go!

51:46.019 --> 51:49.105
[Crowder]  In the shotgun is Larry Sisson.
Fires it right side...

51:49.189 --> 51:50.274
Caught! Split two defenders,

51:50.357 --> 51:53.235
inside the 30, 15, 20...
down to the near sideline spinning...

51:53.318 --> 51:55.904
-[Wagner] Jeez, get him!
-...and being spun down around the six.

51:55.987 --> 51:57.656
-Damn.
-[player] God damn!

51:57.739 --> 51:58.782
Fuck, man!

51:58.865 --> 52:01.201
If I can see it coming...
Did y'all watch film?

52:01.285 --> 52:03.036
Did anybody watch film this week?

52:03.119 --> 52:05.038
Watch one, one slot!

52:05.121 --> 52:07.707
[Crowder]  So first down
and goal to go for Gulf Coast.

52:07.791 --> 52:09.918
And they leave it with Jones.
Jones tries to cut downfield,

52:10.001 --> 52:12.629
they're coming around the near side,
diving... Touchdown, Gulf Coast!

52:12.712 --> 52:16.132
And we're knotted up at 14 apiece
with 1:20 to go before half.

52:16.216 --> 52:18.343
[Chauncey] We missing
too many fucking plays, bro!

52:18.427 --> 52:20.470
Missing too many fucking plays!

52:20.554 --> 52:23.097
That's bullshit!
They shouldn't have 14 points.

52:23.182 --> 52:24.891
Y'all bullshitting. We gotta step up, bro!

52:24.974 --> 52:27.686
-Listen now. That's the second time...
-God damn!

52:27.769 --> 52:31.147
[Devaunya] Did y'all watch film?
'Cause they clearly know your moves.

52:31.231 --> 52:34.776
Y'all might wanna step up!
'Cause they watched film this week!

52:34.859 --> 52:37.446
That's the third time.
That's not the second,

52:37.529 --> 52:39.198
-that's the third time.
-Sit down and be quiet.

52:39.281 --> 52:41.408
If I can see it coming,
did y'all watch film?

52:41.491 --> 52:43.660
-[Buddy] Hush! Hush! Hush!
-[Devaunya] Wrong one!

52:43.743 --> 52:45.704
-I will put you out, hush!
-[Devaunya] Wrong one!

52:45.787 --> 52:48.039
-[Buddy] Who is that? Is that your mom?
-Yeah.

52:48.122 --> 52:49.708
Tell her to be please be quiet.

52:49.791 --> 52:51.835
-That's how she's been all my life.
-[Buddy] Tell her to be quiet.

52:51.918 --> 52:55.630
Hey, please?
I don't need all that. All right?

52:56.298 --> 52:59.593
There's a lady standing up there,
up against the rail.

52:59.676 --> 53:01.220
-Uh... Yes.
-That lady in the gray?

53:01.303 --> 53:04.180
Have her removed, put her in the seats,
if she don't be quiet,

53:04.264 --> 53:06.266
she's gonna be asked to leave.

53:06.350 --> 53:07.434
Don't tell me to be quiet.

53:09.269 --> 53:11.605
-Please leave.
-[Devaunya] Don't tell me to be quiet!

53:11.688 --> 53:13.315
-I'm not that girl!
-God damn!

53:13.398 --> 53:15.609
You're gonna put me out
for voicing my opinion?

53:15.692 --> 53:18.069
He sent you over here
and he couldn't say it to me

53:18.152 --> 53:20.364
because I turn around and said
they need to watch film?

53:20.447 --> 53:22.198
Come on, now. This every game.

53:22.282 --> 53:24.409
I've never seen somebody
with a bruised ego.

53:24.492 --> 53:26.494
You saw that right? Wow!

53:27.537 --> 53:28.997
-Think we're gonna win?
-[guard] I hope.

53:29.080 --> 53:30.332
Not if they don't get it together

53:30.415 --> 53:32.667
'cause everybody's ego
is bruised right now.

53:33.335 --> 53:36.212
Except the other team, Gulf Coast,
'cause they watch film.

53:36.296 --> 53:38.298
-Y'all got a police chief, don't you?
-Yeah.

53:38.382 --> 53:40.592
You might want to get him,
'cause if you think I drove from Atlanta

53:40.675 --> 53:42.261
-to get put out of my son's game...
-[laughing]

53:42.344 --> 53:45.305
...because of a bruised ego,
y'all got me thoroughly confused.

53:45.389 --> 53:47.599
-[Chauncey] Where you going?
-[Devaunya] Getting put out

53:47.682 --> 53:50.018
by your coach 'cause I said
y'all need to watch film.

53:50.101 --> 53:51.978
-I'm just telling you.
-[Chauncey] No, hell no.

53:52.061 --> 53:54.105
-Thank you. I'm just saying.
-[Chauncey] Go sit down.

53:54.188 --> 53:57.401
-Thank you. I got you. You ready?
-[Chauncey] Hell no. Got me fucked up.

53:58.693 --> 54:01.905
[Devaunya] I got you, baby. 'Cause I said
they need to watch film, he put me out.

54:01.988 --> 54:04.157
Give a fuck, my mama come see me play.
Hell no. Sit down.

54:04.240 --> 54:05.742
-[Devaunya] I got you.
-[Chauncey] Got me fucked up.

54:05.825 --> 54:08.077
-[player] Do your thing.
-If anything, you stand here.

54:08.161 --> 54:09.496
They ain't putting you out.
Got me fucked up.

54:09.579 --> 54:12.123
I wasn't going nowhere,
so trust your mama. Go play.

54:12.206 --> 54:14.000
-Make sure my mama stay here.
-I got you.

54:14.083 --> 54:16.545
-[Chauncey] Make sure my mama stay here.
-I ain't going.

54:16.628 --> 54:19.047
[Crowder]  17-14 is the score here
at the half,

54:19.130 --> 54:20.799
and these two teams look even here today.

54:20.882 --> 54:22.926
[Buddy] Everybody in!
Let's go! On the hop!

54:23.009 --> 54:24.678
The fuck out the game, bitch ass nigga.

54:24.761 --> 54:27.889
[Crowder]  Buddy Stephens is motioning
for his guys to go to the locker room.

54:27.972 --> 54:30.350
[Chauncey] Fuck! Give a fuck!

54:30.434 --> 54:32.727
You're all right, you're all right,
you're all right.

54:32.811 --> 54:34.646
[Chauncey]
Throw her ass out the fucking game.

54:34.729 --> 54:35.897
[Chauncey] Hey, you straight?

54:35.980 --> 54:38.191
Tell him to try me again.
I'm not going nowhere.

54:38.274 --> 54:40.652
-[Chauncey] All right.
-[Brian]  Hey, Chauncey.

54:40.735 --> 54:43.154
-Your mama ain't playing.
-[Chauncey] She don't go for that.

54:43.237 --> 54:46.032
She ain't playing.
Did you hear his mama, bro?

54:46.741 --> 54:48.410
Trying to put my mama
out of the game, bro.

54:48.493 --> 54:51.246
She just drove four hours,
you think... Come on, bro.

54:51.705 --> 54:53.540
I ain't going for none of that, bro.

54:54.457 --> 54:58.169
[Buddy] Why y'all got that long look?
Y'all ready for this to be the last game?

54:58.252 --> 55:01.047
Y'all ready for this...
Some of y'all need this game, okay?

55:01.130 --> 55:02.882
Keep playing, keep playing!

55:02.966 --> 55:04.092
[De'Andre] This is an offer game.

55:04.175 --> 55:07.136
This gonna make or break
our year of recruiting right here.

55:07.220 --> 55:10.014
Let's go out and dominate these boys,
'cause they not better than us.

55:10.098 --> 55:13.101
Let's do it. Get the O-line right.
Let's go out here and take and dominate.

55:13.184 --> 55:15.603
-[Williams] What's going on?
-They was trying to put my mama

55:15.687 --> 55:16.855
out of the game. That ain't--

55:16.938 --> 55:19.315
Hey. Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.

55:19.399 --> 55:22.652
Listen to me, okay?
I get what you're saying, all right?

55:22.736 --> 55:24.613
I get what you're saying, okay,
but we gotta...

55:24.696 --> 55:27.491
-We still gotta play right now.
-I'm saying, but my mama important.

55:27.574 --> 55:29.242
-She drove four hours to see our game.
-I know.

55:29.325 --> 55:31.119
She ain't finna go outside
and watch no game.

55:31.202 --> 55:35.582
Hey, okay. Hey, can you just focus
on this 30 minutes now?

55:35.665 --> 55:38.167
-Is she good? She good? All right.
-Yeah, she's straight.

55:38.251 --> 55:41.713
Just keep balling, now. 'Cause we need you
right now. Keep balling.

55:41.796 --> 55:45.550
[Winfield]  Lions hoping to advance
to a state championship a week from now.

55:45.634 --> 55:48.344
[Crowder]  EMCC has a lot of work
to do here in the second half.

55:48.428 --> 55:51.765
17-all, third quarter. Gulf Coast
showing pressure around the right side,

55:51.848 --> 55:53.850
and it's gonna be tipped up
in the air and intercepted

55:53.933 --> 55:55.977
-at the 30-yard line by Gulf Coast.
-[crowd cheering]

55:56.060 --> 55:58.021
[Ed Holly] Just tackle him.
We'll stop him.

55:58.104 --> 56:01.107
Just tackle him. We'll stop him.
We will stop him.

56:01.190 --> 56:03.402
[Williams] Okay, let's go, let's go,
let's go. Hurry up!

56:03.485 --> 56:06.320
[Crowder]  They came around the right
and tipped it. The linebacker got it.

56:06.405 --> 56:09.949
[Winfield]  All of a sudden, Gulf Coast
is in business, a chance to take the lead.

56:10.033 --> 56:12.619
[Beard]  Gonna have to find out
what the Lions are made of.

56:12.702 --> 56:15.830
Adversity has showed up here
at this football game.

56:15.914 --> 56:20.209
[Chauncey] Hey! We gotta be great!
We gotta be great! We gotta be great!

56:20.293 --> 56:21.920
[Crowder]  The spot of the football,
the eight-yard line.

56:22.003 --> 56:24.464
[Ed Holly] Jet sweep! Jet sweep!
Jet sweep! Hold, hold, hold!

56:24.548 --> 56:26.257
[Crowder]  They bring a man in motion
from far side to near,

56:26.340 --> 56:28.427
but they give it to Jones,
who spins out of a tackle

56:28.510 --> 56:31.345
at the five-yard line,
then dives in for the touchdown.

56:31.430 --> 56:34.057
And Gulf Coast has
its first lead of the game.

56:34.140 --> 56:35.975
Oh, my goodness!

56:36.059 --> 56:38.437
[Williams] You two guys done gave up
that whole damn drive.

56:38.520 --> 56:40.480
You looked like
a deer in the headlights to him.

56:40.564 --> 56:42.857
-Fill!
-[Isaiah] Every time. Every time!

56:42.941 --> 56:44.443
We giving them the damn game.

56:44.526 --> 56:45.735
[Isaiah] Every time!

56:45.819 --> 56:49.363
-Isaiah, you ain't a coach. Shut up.
-[Isaiah] I'm talking to myself, Coach.

56:49.448 --> 56:51.658
Hey. God damn,
y'all must let these motherfuckers

56:51.741 --> 56:53.452
just talk to y'all any goddamn way. Shit.

56:53.535 --> 56:55.036
[Wood] No, we're not. We're good.

56:55.119 --> 56:57.330
[Buddy] I mean, hell!
You don't take back talk.

56:57.413 --> 56:59.499
-[Buddy] You might take it, I ain't.
-[Wood] We're good.

56:59.583 --> 57:01.793
[Isaiah laughs] I didn't say anything.

57:01.876 --> 57:04.128
-[Isaiah] Man, fuck that nigga.
-[Buddy] That's the damn problem.

57:04.212 --> 57:05.839
Some of y'all need to grow a pair of nuts.

57:05.922 --> 57:08.299
[Crowder]  Everybody goes for the pass,
firing it over the middle,

57:08.382 --> 57:10.343
incomplete.
He had to get rid of it too fast.

57:10.426 --> 57:13.054
[Buddy] Throw the flag!
He sat there and grabbed him!

57:13.137 --> 57:17.100
He sat there and grabbed him!
And you watched it! You watched it!

57:17.183 --> 57:20.604
You watched him grab him and trip him!
He tripped him, he grabbed him!

57:20.687 --> 57:24.691
And you watched it!
Hey! Hey! You watched it!

57:24.774 --> 57:27.026
You watched him grab him
and pull him down!

57:27.110 --> 57:30.321
[Crowder]  This has just been a struggle
for EMCC with any kind of rhythm.

57:30.404 --> 57:33.658
Fires it short, near side at the hash,
caught, and ball's on the ground.

57:33.742 --> 57:36.327
And Gulf Coast picks it up
at the 40-yard line.

57:36.410 --> 57:38.997
Buddy Stephens very upset
with his offensive line.

57:39.080 --> 57:40.874
[Buddy] What the hell's the problem? What?

57:40.957 --> 57:42.751
-[Buddy] Tell me! Tell me!
-Nothing.

57:42.834 --> 57:44.043
[Buddy] Tell me
you're just damn weak!

57:44.127 --> 57:47.046
Tell me you're just damn gettin'
your ass whipped! Tell me something!

57:48.298 --> 57:50.508
[Buddy] That's horseshit,
pussy-fucking shit.

57:52.761 --> 57:53.887
Get it back!

57:55.054 --> 57:56.848
Get it the hell back.

57:56.931 --> 57:59.308
[Winfield]  Boy,
such an important defensive series

57:59.392 --> 58:00.935
right here for East Mississippi.

58:01.019 --> 58:04.523
Gulf Coast with the football,
but they face a third down and 16.

58:04.606 --> 58:07.108
This is a big play
for this Lions' defense.

58:07.191 --> 58:09.944
Spread out! Spread out! Spread out!

58:10.737 --> 58:13.698
[Crowder]  On the snap, back to pass,
pocket collapses and hit hard!

58:13.782 --> 58:15.992
And they're gonna sack him back
at the 23-yard line.

58:16.075 --> 58:17.619
[cheering]

58:17.702 --> 58:21.247
[Chauncey] Hey! Hey! Keep going hard
all motherfucking game!

58:21.330 --> 58:24.000
-Good shit. Good shit. Good shit.
-Hold on, man. Don't touch me.

58:24.083 --> 58:25.627
-[referee] Come back.
-It's between plays!

58:25.710 --> 58:27.128
-[referee] Don't be acting up.
-Don't touch me.

58:27.211 --> 58:30.423
I understand, but don't touch me.
I don't touch you.

58:31.215 --> 58:33.802
I mean, gosh, Almighty. It's between...

58:33.885 --> 58:36.930
Hey! It's between series,
I can be pretty much where I wanna be.

58:37.013 --> 58:38.097
Back up!

58:38.890 --> 58:41.309
Everybody. Oh, I'm sorry.
I thought you was my guy.

58:41.392 --> 58:43.645
[Winfield]  12:38 to play
in this football game.

58:43.728 --> 58:48.066
The Lions of East Mississippi trailing
the Bulldogs of Gulf Coast 24-20.

58:48.149 --> 58:50.109
[Crowder]  EMCC trails,
but they're knocking on the door.

58:50.193 --> 58:53.029
Come out here and look.
Come on. Come on.

58:53.112 --> 58:56.032
[Crowder]  Johnson with the snap,
fires it left side on a little slant.

58:56.115 --> 58:59.410
Willis breaks through. He's inside the 20,
he's gonna be inside the 15.

58:59.493 --> 59:02.664
Running towards the end zone,
but he's dragged down from behind.

59:02.747 --> 59:05.625
Jet! Jet! Jet! Jet! Jet!

59:05.709 --> 59:07.919
[Crowder]  Vijay Miller has now come
into the contest.

59:08.002 --> 59:09.295
[Winfield]  Vijay has
six rushing touchdowns.

59:09.378 --> 59:11.505
He's a true dual threat here at this spot.

59:11.590 --> 59:13.466
[Crowder]  From far side to near
and it's a fake of the give,

59:13.550 --> 59:15.594
going straight up the middle,
towards the goal line... Touchdown!

59:15.677 --> 59:16.886
[Winfield]  Well, what'd we say?

59:16.970 --> 59:20.098
Vijay Miller actually leads this team
in rushing touchdowns.

59:20.181 --> 59:21.474
That's his seventh now.

59:21.558 --> 59:23.517
[Crowder]  And it is 27-24.

59:23.602 --> 59:26.104
EMCC up by three with 9:02
to go in the game.

59:26.855 --> 59:28.356
[Buddy] Hey, defense!

59:28.439 --> 59:31.150
Everybody get over here.
All of y'all are spread out.

59:31.234 --> 59:32.902
Y'all been doing this all year long.

59:32.986 --> 59:35.488
All of you are spread out
all over the place.

59:35.572 --> 59:36.865
You got your little group here,

59:36.948 --> 59:38.449
your group here, your group here.

59:38.532 --> 59:41.327
Now, by God, y'all gonna have
to come together and play hard

59:41.410 --> 59:45.248
and want it more than they want it.
Right now, they're coming to get your ass.

59:48.292 --> 59:51.337
[Crowder]  We're less than two minutes away
from finding out who's gonna advance

59:51.420 --> 59:54.007
to meet Northwest
in the state championship game.

59:54.090 --> 59:56.760
And if Gulf Coast can somehow
come back and win this one,

59:56.843 --> 59:58.511
they would host Northwest next week.

59:58.595 --> 1:00:01.723
[Beard]  They're out of their time-outs.
It's on your defense right here.

1:00:01.806 --> 1:00:03.057
[Crowder]  Gulf Coast moving
from right to left.

1:00:03.141 --> 1:00:04.893
Here's the snap, back to pass.

1:00:04.976 --> 1:00:07.145
And a hit from behind

1:00:07.228 --> 1:00:08.938
and the ball's loose!
Let's see who has it.

1:00:09.022 --> 1:00:10.982
There's a scramble for it.
EMCC says they have it.

1:00:11.065 --> 1:00:12.984
-And they do!
-[cheering]

1:00:13.067 --> 1:00:15.153
The Lions may have just sealed the deal.

1:00:15.236 --> 1:00:17.781
[Winfield]  Dakota Allen comes out
of there with the football,

1:00:17.864 --> 1:00:20.241
a really good player on this defense
for the Lions.

1:00:20.324 --> 1:00:22.410
Comes out of there with the football

1:00:22.493 --> 1:00:25.830
on a play
that probably seals this football game.

1:00:26.580 --> 1:00:30.877
[Crowder]  And the redemption season
continues to roll on, 27-24.

1:00:30.960 --> 1:00:33.379
Your final score, number three, EMCC,

1:00:33.462 --> 1:00:37.842
on top of Mississippi Gulf Coast
in a roller coaster of a ride of a game.

1:00:37.926 --> 1:00:40.762
But Buddy Stephens
and his club and staff did it.

1:00:42.346 --> 1:00:44.348
[stadium announcer]
That's your game. The score...

1:00:44.432 --> 1:00:47.936
[Buddy]  Let me tell you something.
You did a great job in spite of me,

1:00:48.019 --> 1:00:50.855
in spite of them, you did a great job.

1:00:50.939 --> 1:00:54.651
You sucked it up, you played hard,
you continued to hammer away.

1:00:54.734 --> 1:00:57.779
Hey, great job today, guys.
Heck of a good job.

1:00:57.862 --> 1:00:59.322
-But we got one more.
-[all applauding]

1:00:59.405 --> 1:01:02.200
-Northwest's gotta bring their butt here.
-[cheering]

1:01:02.283 --> 1:01:06.495
[Buddy] Okay? All right? We got
one more Saturday together to get a ring.

1:01:06.579 --> 1:01:07.706
Let's knock it out!

1:01:09.833 --> 1:01:12.460
-[Wagner] Good job, buddy. You tired?
-Yeah.

1:01:12.543 --> 1:01:14.420
-Is your mom all right?
-Yeah, she straight.

1:01:16.005 --> 1:01:18.424
[Wagner]  Yeah,
the players can be frustrating,

1:01:18.508 --> 1:01:23.221
but the players are the only people
that have gotten me through these years.

1:01:23.304 --> 1:01:27.850
Like, they are truly and honestly
the reason I come to work every day.

1:01:28.977 --> 1:01:29.978
Good job, honey.

1:01:30.061 --> 1:01:31.645
I don't want you to see me crying.

1:01:31.730 --> 1:01:33.857
-I don't want you to see me cry.
-Let me see you cry.

1:01:33.940 --> 1:01:36.234
-No. Mmm-mmm.
-Let me... I see a tear.

1:01:36.317 --> 1:01:40.279
I see one. It's right there.
I got it. I got it on my finger.

1:01:40.363 --> 1:01:42.448
[Tim] I've never been in
a championship in my life.

1:01:42.531 --> 1:01:45.451
You're gonna win one. You deserve it.

1:01:45.534 --> 1:01:47.120
-Okay?
-Yeah, ma'am. Yeah, ma'am.

1:01:47.203 --> 1:01:49.038
-[Wagner] Love you.
-[Tim] I love you, too.

1:01:51.040 --> 1:01:54.210
The defense coaches are doing
a great job of getting 'em ready.

1:01:54.293 --> 1:01:57.213
[Wagner chuckles]  I would not ever show up
if it were just about

1:01:57.296 --> 1:02:00.508
the adults on this campus.
I mean, I wouldn't.

1:02:00.591 --> 1:02:02.593
I don't know if he's changed or not.

1:02:02.677 --> 1:02:06.472
According to what the players tell me,
they're not seeing a whole lot of change.

1:02:06.555 --> 1:02:08.808
But maybe he's quit cussing. If so, great.

1:02:13.229 --> 1:02:14.313
I haven't.

1:02:16.357 --> 1:02:20.111
[Devaunya]  I think Buddy is in a position
to affect a lot of kids' lives.

1:02:20.194 --> 1:02:22.864
You can be the most
winningest coach in history,

1:02:22.947 --> 1:02:26.868
but if you don't touch lives,
what is it meant for?

1:02:27.451 --> 1:02:29.913
-[laughs]
-I'm good. Golly!

1:02:31.122 --> 1:02:34.583
-[laughing]
-Hey! It was the rip and lean.

1:02:34.667 --> 1:02:36.085
-Yeah!
-You know what I'm saying?

1:02:36.169 --> 1:02:37.295
[laughing]

1:02:37.879 --> 1:02:40.631
Good luck to you guys. Good luck.
Good luck, guys. Good luck.

1:02:40.714 --> 1:02:42.341
Hell of a damn football player there...

1:02:42.425 --> 1:02:43.885
[Buddy]  I wanna be happy.
I wanna be a happy person.

1:02:43.968 --> 1:02:45.762
I've always been a happy person.

1:02:45.845 --> 1:02:48.681
But not during the season.
It always changes you.

1:02:48.765 --> 1:02:50.809
It's a Jekyll and Hyde personality.

1:02:50.892 --> 1:02:54.603
It's tough to look at yourself
after you're 50 years old and you go...

1:02:55.479 --> 1:02:57.816
"I ain't even close to being right.

1:02:57.899 --> 1:03:00.734
I'm not close to being the person
that you wanna be."

1:03:00.819 --> 1:03:02.195
That's tough.

1:03:03.237 --> 1:03:05.281
[Wagner]  Whatever it is
that you didn't like

1:03:05.364 --> 1:03:08.451
that you're battling with,
then change it internally,

1:03:08.534 --> 1:03:11.079
if you're really trying
to be a better person.

1:03:11.162 --> 1:03:14.040
I feel like he's trying
to change externally

1:03:14.123 --> 1:03:17.085
what society deems acceptable
or unacceptable.

1:03:18.252 --> 1:03:20.463
[Buddy]  People that don't like you,
they're not gonna like you.

1:03:20.546 --> 1:03:22.506
People that hate
are gonna hate for no reason.

1:03:22.590 --> 1:03:23.842
And that I can't change.

1:03:23.925 --> 1:03:28.179
But you worry about living up to
who you say you are.

1:03:29.555 --> 1:03:30.681
You worry about that.
