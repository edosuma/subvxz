00:41.780 --> 00:44.396
Go, Lindsay!
Take it, Lindsay!

00:45.232 --> 00:47.523
God, I love you, Lindsay!

01:11.677 --> 01:14.646
Somebody lower the godforsaken ringer!

01:14.680 --> 01:17.032
Hello?

01:17.066 --> 01:18.767
God.

01:18.801 --> 01:21.002
No.

01:21.037 --> 01:23.505
So awful.

01:25.675 --> 01:27.375
All right, where was I?

01:27.410 --> 01:29.444
"Truth or Dare":
Somebody ask me a truth.

01:29.478 --> 01:31.158
Nothing about crushes,
I get embarrassed.

01:31.159 --> 01:32.314
What was that call?

01:32.348 --> 01:34.282
Lindsay, the babysitter, broke her leg.

01:34.317 --> 01:36.835
She has to cancel.
Man.

01:36.869 --> 01:39.738
I was really looking forward
to our big date tonight.

01:39.772 --> 01:41.139
It was gonna be perfect.

01:41.173 --> 01:42.641
Tickets to <i>Cavalia,</i>

01:42.675 --> 01:45.010
the greatest horse show on Earth.

01:46.913 --> 01:48.880
God.

01:48.915 --> 01:49.998
Nothing turns me on

01:50.032 --> 01:53.084
like horses and
horse-related theater.

01:53.119 --> 01:55.453
It gets me going, too.

01:57.823 --> 01:59.424
That's why I got us a room afterwards

01:59.458 --> 02:03.011
at the DC Sheraton, for nasty hotel sex.

02:03.045 --> 02:04.713
A junior suite.

02:07.383 --> 02:10.368
Welp, if you guys cancel,
you're out 200 bucks.

02:10.436 --> 02:13.104
What?!
I was gonna surprise you.

02:13.139 --> 02:14.839
I hired Roger to drive us

02:14.874 --> 02:16.825
to the show
in a horse-drawn carriage.

02:16.859 --> 02:19.210
Taking horses to watch horses?

02:19.245 --> 02:21.780
How bad does this girl want it?

02:25.084 --> 02:26.284
Damn it!

02:26.319 --> 02:28.853
If Lindsay can't babysit,
we got to reschedule.

02:28.888 --> 02:30.889
I'll watch Steve.

02:33.159 --> 02:34.626
Why is that funny?

02:34.660 --> 02:37.829
Why is <i>Mike & Molly</i> funny?
'Cause they're fat.

02:37.863 --> 02:39.931
And this is funny
'cause you're irresponsible.

02:39.966 --> 02:41.316
I'm not irresponsible.

02:41.350 --> 02:44.094
You're one chore
is to clean Klaus's bowl.

02:44.154 --> 02:46.456
How am I supposed to eat
my cereal out of this?

02:47.139 --> 02:49.074
Come on, how hard is it to watch Steve?

02:49.108 --> 02:51.126
He doesn't even know how
to get in trouble.

02:51.160 --> 02:52.227
He's a dweeb.

02:52.261 --> 02:54.429
I'm not a dweeb.

02:54.463 --> 02:56.064
I-I'm a wild one.

02:56.098 --> 02:58.333
Just the other day,
I was holding a hot dog

02:58.367 --> 02:59.901
as if it were a cigar.

02:59.935 --> 03:02.337
A cigar!

03:02.371 --> 03:04.072
Wait!

03:04.106 --> 03:05.573
We can't reschedule.

03:05.608 --> 03:07.776
This is <i>Cavalia's</i> last weekend.

03:08.844 --> 03:10.578
Stakes.
Conference.

03:19.121 --> 03:23.258
Hayley, it is with many, many,
many, <i>many</i> reservations

03:23.292 --> 03:27.295
that we say this, but you'll be
babysitting Steve tonight.

03:27.330 --> 03:29.197
You guys have nothing to worry about.

03:29.231 --> 03:30.365
And if this goes well,

03:30.399 --> 03:33.001
maybe you can look after
my baby next week.

03:33.035 --> 03:35.270
I found him in a hospital.

03:39.008 --> 03:42.544
You look so gorgeous!

03:42.578 --> 03:45.063
You look like that little slut
from <i>Tangled.</i>

03:45.081 --> 03:47.866
Man, am I gonna give it to you tonight.

03:47.900 --> 03:49.367
Yeah, you are.

03:49.402 --> 03:52.921
Right after we watch horses together.

03:52.955 --> 03:56.691
Yes.

03:56.726 --> 03:59.627
yeah...

03:59.662 --> 04:02.380
Hayley, did you fill up my car with gas

04:02.414 --> 04:03.348
after you borrowed it?

04:03.382 --> 04:04.949
If you need to go anywhere,

04:04.984 --> 04:08.086
I don't want you driving Steve
in Jeff's sketchy van.

04:08.120 --> 04:09.888
He's precious cargo.

04:09.922 --> 04:11.489
Aww.

04:12.458 --> 04:13.525
No underwear?

04:13.559 --> 04:16.060
What's the point?

04:16.095 --> 04:18.697
Look, I got everything
under control, okay?

04:18.731 --> 04:20.365
Now, go on, get out of here.

04:23.669 --> 04:25.837
Evening, sir.
I'm here for Mr. and Mrs.

04:25.871 --> 04:30.341
"For Display Purposes Only.
This Is Not A Real Cell Phone."

04:31.844 --> 04:33.728
Well, see you tomorrow.

04:33.763 --> 04:34.763
And Hayley...

04:35.464 --> 04:37.599
...if you mess this up,

04:37.633 --> 04:40.502
I will never, ever

04:40.536 --> 04:44.038
trust you again.

04:44.073 --> 04:45.790
Bye, kids!

04:47.343 --> 04:49.127
Hey, babe, want a pot brownie?

04:49.145 --> 04:50.962
No! I'm babysitting.

04:50.996 --> 04:51.930
I'm being responsible.

04:51.964 --> 04:54.933
Good, 'cause I already ate both.

04:54.967 --> 04:57.635
Wait, did I?

04:57.670 --> 04:59.437
You did, bro.

05:03.776 --> 05:05.977
Steve, I'm calling in the pizza.

05:21.527 --> 05:22.560
Steve, did you...

05:22.595 --> 05:25.096
Invite my friends over
without asking? Yeah.

05:25.131 --> 05:28.016
Cook an Italian dinner with only
the freshest ingredients?

05:28.050 --> 05:29.134
You bet.

05:29.168 --> 05:31.219
You called me a dweeb,
said I wasn't wild.

05:31.253 --> 05:33.138
How do you like me now?

05:33.172 --> 05:35.123
So, you made dinner?

05:35.157 --> 05:37.142
That's, that's crazy for you?

05:37.176 --> 05:42.230
Okay, well, try not to get
Mom's apron dirty, wild man.

05:42.264 --> 05:43.832
Damn it, it's true.

05:43.866 --> 05:45.066
I'm not wild.

05:47.770 --> 05:50.538
I don't know what you just said,
but you said it in Asian.

05:50.573 --> 05:54.509
Speaking of Asians, I heard that
Alpha Asian, Vince Chung,

05:54.543 --> 05:56.177
is having a party tonight.

05:56.212 --> 05:58.046
That's it!
We'll go.

05:58.080 --> 05:59.664
That's how we'll be crazy.

06:01.534 --> 06:03.668
How's this for crazy?

06:03.702 --> 06:06.037
You just won the Super Bowl!

06:06.071 --> 06:08.807
It's boiling!

06:08.841 --> 06:11.309
Gonna be a fun night, guys.

06:15.498 --> 06:17.565
Folks, we'll be at <i>Cavalia</i> in no time.

06:17.600 --> 06:20.151
If you're gonna do it back
there, I have a family-size tub

06:20.186 --> 06:22.120
of Kirkland lubricant under the seat.

06:22.154 --> 06:23.594
If you could please pass it forward,

06:23.595 --> 06:25.290
I'll be using it while I watch you.

06:25.324 --> 06:28.409
Thanks, but we're holding off
so we can really explode later.

06:28.444 --> 06:30.124
Of course.
There's a blanket by your feet

06:30.125 --> 06:31.529
if you get chilly on the highway.

06:31.563 --> 06:33.731
The what?
Highway. Hyah!

06:39.505 --> 06:41.539
They're just honking
'cause they're jealous.

06:47.249 --> 06:48.847
Welp, we're heading out.

06:48.881 --> 06:51.900
Hitting the town,
wild-style.

06:51.934 --> 06:54.335
I didn't BM after dinner,

06:54.370 --> 06:56.004
but I'm gonna leave the house anyway,

06:56.038 --> 06:57.071
see what happens.

06:57.106 --> 07:00.775
Caution to the wind.

07:00.809 --> 07:02.143
Okay, Steve, real cute.

07:02.177 --> 07:03.578
Mom and Dad put me in charge,

07:03.612 --> 07:05.046
and you're not going anywhere.

07:05.080 --> 07:06.598
But, you can't...
I said no.

07:06.632 --> 07:08.933
Now, go upstairs
and play with yourselves.

07:08.951 --> 07:12.954
Unbelievable, Hayley.

07:12.988 --> 07:16.558
No, no, Steve, great idea.

07:16.592 --> 07:20.611
Let's go to your room
and play with ourselves.

07:20.629 --> 07:21.946
Are we...

07:21.981 --> 07:23.882
Are we actually gonna do this?

07:23.916 --> 07:26.751
I wish Mom and Dad could've seen that.

07:26.785 --> 07:28.753
Me, too, man.

07:28.787 --> 07:30.989
I think I'm really proving myself.

07:31.023 --> 07:33.258
Me, too, man.

07:33.292 --> 07:34.392
This is gonna sound weird,

07:34.426 --> 07:36.427
but, for the first time in my life,

07:36.461 --> 07:38.479
I feel like a grown woman.

07:38.514 --> 07:40.348
Me, too, man.

07:48.691 --> 07:50.508
Run!

07:51.944 --> 07:53.177
Come on, Jeff!

08:10.212 --> 08:12.630
Nu-uh,
not on my watch!

08:23.726 --> 08:25.360
Son of a bitch!

08:25.394 --> 08:27.495
I was supposed to get gas.

08:27.529 --> 08:29.597
Did you?

08:33.434 --> 08:34.501
Hey, Lindsay.

08:34.535 --> 08:35.903
How you holding up there, champ?

08:35.938 --> 08:37.071
Pretty good, Doc.

08:38.173 --> 08:39.674
No, no, you're not.

08:39.707 --> 08:40.948
The fracture actually triggered

08:40.948 --> 08:42.644
an aggressive staph infection.

08:42.678 --> 08:43.678
In all likelihood,

08:43.712 --> 08:45.780
you're going to lose your leg.

08:45.814 --> 08:46.948
Looks like you, young man,

08:46.982 --> 08:48.983
have a medical problem, too.

08:49.018 --> 08:51.486
W-What-What's that?

08:51.520 --> 08:52.887
You've lost your nose!

08:52.921 --> 08:55.323
Yes, you did.

08:58.360 --> 09:00.011
Babe, slow down!

09:00.045 --> 09:01.279
So Steve snuck out?

09:01.313 --> 09:02.346
It's no big deal.

09:02.381 --> 09:03.431
It is a big deal.

09:03.465 --> 09:05.216
My parents already think I'm a joke.

09:05.250 --> 09:07.268
Don't worry, babe, we'll find him.

09:07.302 --> 09:09.604
Steve!

09:09.638 --> 09:10.872
What?

09:10.906 --> 09:13.174
No, we're looking for Steve.

09:13.208 --> 09:15.910
That's my name.

09:15.944 --> 09:18.880
Babe, I don't know what to do here.

09:18.914 --> 09:21.883
Man, I'm pumped for Vince Chung's party.

09:21.917 --> 09:23.634
Y'all say Vince Chung's party?

09:23.669 --> 09:25.069
They're letting nerds like you in,

09:25.103 --> 09:27.371
y'all must be bringing
some serious liquor.

09:27.406 --> 09:29.223
Yeah, of course we are.

09:29.258 --> 09:33.127
How else would we get in?

09:37.916 --> 09:39.300
Move it!

09:41.169 --> 09:43.588
Hell no! Go on, get!

09:47.593 --> 09:49.760
Roger, I don't...
We got this!

09:49.794 --> 09:51.462
You dick!

10:06.395 --> 10:08.529
That's what you get for
tangling with a Honda.

10:08.564 --> 10:10.197
Every time.

10:10.232 --> 10:12.433
Now how are we gonna get to <i>Cavalia?</i>

10:12.467 --> 10:14.352
I don't know, maybe
we should just go home.

10:14.386 --> 10:15.986
I'm kind of worried about leaving Hayley

10:15.987 --> 10:16.871
in charge, anyway.

10:16.905 --> 10:19.006
No, no, no. You hired me
to get you to <i>Cavalia,</i>

10:19.041 --> 10:21.058
and I'm gonna get you there.

10:22.361 --> 10:23.377
Now, Diamond!

10:23.412 --> 10:24.828
Now, Nanny McPhee!

10:26.498 --> 10:29.166
Welp, only one way home.

10:31.053 --> 10:34.622
Whee!

10:37.159 --> 10:39.310
Damn it, they're not here.

10:39.344 --> 10:41.195
Where would four high school kids go?

10:41.229 --> 10:43.097
<i>Yo, Donnie!</i>
<i>Doing another delivery</i>

10:43.131 --> 10:44.665
<i>to that high school kid's party?</i>

10:44.700 --> 10:48.035
Yeah! This party's very
close and easy to get to.

10:48.070 --> 10:51.205
Just a left on Sycamore
and a right on Sherbourne,

10:51.239 --> 10:52.273
and you're there.

10:52.307 --> 10:54.609
212 Sherbourne.

10:54.643 --> 10:55.927
Did you hear that?

10:55.961 --> 10:57.681
Steve and his friends
are definitely gonna

10:57.682 --> 10:58.362
be at that party.

10:58.397 --> 11:01.182
I guess the only question is:

11:01.216 --> 11:03.034
What are we talking about?

11:10.108 --> 11:12.009
I'm gonna call you, Barry.

11:12.043 --> 11:14.044
I'm gonna hold you to that, Nate!

11:16.565 --> 11:18.366
Okay, so we just need to find

11:18.400 --> 11:20.434
a kind stranger to buy us liquor.

11:20.469 --> 11:21.435
Hey...

11:21.470 --> 11:23.004
uh, you boys need some booze?

11:23.038 --> 11:24.038
I'll get you booze.

11:24.072 --> 11:26.040
But you got to do something for me.

11:26.074 --> 11:28.576
I need you to go
buy me, like, uh, like,

11:28.610 --> 11:30.144
a hundred boxes of Sudafed.

11:30.178 --> 11:32.847
Holy meth-moly!

11:34.316 --> 11:36.484
Of course we'll buy you
medicine for your cold.

11:36.518 --> 11:37.818
Poor thing.

11:37.853 --> 11:39.720
Okay, great, great.
Okay, I'll get the booze,

11:39.755 --> 11:41.222
you get the Suds.

11:41.256 --> 11:42.736
Here's some dough, here's some dough.

11:42.758 --> 11:44.759
Get a receipt.

11:46.194 --> 11:50.264
I get a really good vibe from that guy.

11:50.298 --> 11:52.199
Great vibe!

11:58.473 --> 11:59.774
Well, they're not upstairs.

11:59.808 --> 12:01.609
I don't see Steve
and his friends anywhere.

12:01.643 --> 12:03.511
Sweet, we got away.

12:03.545 --> 12:04.412
Not helping.

12:04.446 --> 12:07.114
God, I need a drink.

12:13.839 --> 12:15.339
Making meth?

12:15.374 --> 12:17.308
Cute lisp.

12:17.342 --> 12:18.809
No, I'm not making a mess,

12:18.844 --> 12:20.478
I'm gonna buy these.

12:20.512 --> 12:21.846
Steve Smith.

12:23.048 --> 12:24.515
You're funny.
I'm Jenny.

12:24.549 --> 12:26.951
Either that or you're a vest thief.

12:30.555 --> 12:32.790
Listen, I got to
biggity-boing-boing-bounce,

12:32.824 --> 12:34.592
but unless I'm reading this wrong,

12:34.626 --> 12:35.793
which usually only happens

12:35.827 --> 12:38.229
with the menu
at a Vietnamese restaurant...

12:39.965 --> 12:41.399
...we should hang soon.

12:41.433 --> 12:43.267
Here, take my "dig-ios."

12:49.608 --> 12:53.344
I got to make some real changes.

12:55.347 --> 12:57.348
Great, great, great.
The receipt in here?

12:57.382 --> 12:58.516
The receipt.

12:58.550 --> 12:59.984
Yeah.

13:01.019 --> 13:03.220
We got booze, bitches!

13:03.255 --> 13:06.357
And a stack of Spanish-language
quinceaÃ±era cards?

13:06.391 --> 13:07.858
Wait, who put these in here?

13:12.297 --> 13:13.764
How much longer, Stan?

13:13.799 --> 13:15.800
<i>Cavalia</i> starts in ten minutes.

13:15.834 --> 13:17.034
We've got to be getting close.

13:17.052 --> 13:18.669
Look there, I see the lights.

13:24.008 --> 13:25.876
What the hell?!

13:25.911 --> 13:28.079
Stan, why did you lead us here?

13:28.113 --> 13:30.397
I wasn't leading.
I don't speak horse, Francine.

13:30.432 --> 13:31.882
I'm not Matthew Broderick.

13:31.917 --> 13:34.034
They must've just taken
us back to their home.

13:34.069 --> 13:36.720
Damn it!
They tricked us, Francine.

13:36.755 --> 13:38.973
Don't ever trust a horse, I guess.

13:39.007 --> 13:41.308
We were bound to learn
this lesson someday.

13:41.343 --> 13:42.750
Unfortunately, it was tonight,

13:42.751 --> 13:44.311
when the stakes have never been higher.

13:45.380 --> 13:48.432
No <i>Cavalia,</i> no hotel sex.

13:48.467 --> 13:50.017
This night is ruined.

13:50.051 --> 13:51.252
I'm sorry, honey.

13:51.286 --> 13:53.804
I wanted it to be perfect.

14:02.597 --> 14:03.981
What are they doing?

14:04.015 --> 14:06.100
I think they're performing for us.

14:06.151 --> 14:09.103
Our own private <i>Cavalia.</i>

14:11.857 --> 14:13.491
And who needs a hotel room?

14:13.525 --> 14:15.709
Stan.

14:25.086 --> 14:27.354
Ho, ho, Sam, I'm back, baby.

14:27.389 --> 14:30.724
All right, let's get cooking.

14:39.534 --> 14:41.001
Where the hell's the receipt?!

14:41.036 --> 14:44.405
No! No! <i>No!</i>

14:44.439 --> 14:47.741
Those kids screwed me!

14:48.844 --> 14:50.911
What the hell are you oking at?

14:56.067 --> 14:57.351
Have fun.

14:57.385 --> 14:58.402
Be safe.

14:58.436 --> 14:59.336
Glad you're here.

14:59.371 --> 15:01.972
Someone smells good.

15:09.931 --> 15:11.966
She... she-she
texted me!

15:12.000 --> 15:14.235
This is the best night of my...

15:14.269 --> 15:16.737
Steven Anita Smith!

15:17.739 --> 15:20.174
You're in big trouble, mister.

15:20.208 --> 15:21.342
My God.

15:21.376 --> 15:22.710
You're wasted.

15:22.744 --> 15:24.044
Yeah, I'm wasted.

15:24.079 --> 15:26.547
'Cause I-I, I spent
the whole night looking for you.

15:27.949 --> 15:30.417
Get off me!

15:31.519 --> 15:34.788
It's Dad!

15:34.823 --> 15:35.856
Give it to me.

15:35.891 --> 15:37.691
You're gonna get us both in trouble.

15:37.726 --> 15:38.759
Hey, Pop!

15:38.793 --> 15:39.894
Steve?

15:39.928 --> 15:40.961
What's all that noise?

15:40.996 --> 15:43.297
Me and Hayley are just playing a game

15:43.331 --> 15:44.765
called Black Restaurant.

15:44.799 --> 15:45.799
Sounds fun!

15:45.834 --> 15:47.154
Listen, honey, change of plans...

15:47.155 --> 15:48.155
we're heading home early.

15:48.156 --> 15:48.936
See you in an hour.

15:48.970 --> 15:50.588
Mom and Dad are on their way home!

15:50.622 --> 15:52.456
We got to get back there before they do.

15:52.490 --> 15:53.507
Come on!

15:59.698 --> 16:02.132
Hayley is a terrible babysitter.

16:02.167 --> 16:03.234
Lindsay would've never let

16:03.268 --> 16:05.369
things get this out of control.

16:05.403 --> 16:07.705
How can I play soccer with one leg?

16:07.739 --> 16:09.673
I'm gonna lose my scholarship.

16:09.708 --> 16:12.543
Lindsay, you don't have to
worry about any of that.

16:12.577 --> 16:14.979
I... I don't?

16:15.013 --> 16:17.948
No, because the infection
has spread to your heart.

16:17.983 --> 16:19.883
You'll be dead within 24 hours.

16:23.955 --> 16:29.026
Well, I guess that's
within 24 hours, so...

16:29.060 --> 16:31.595
still a pretty good doctor!

16:36.108 --> 16:37.170
Keep puking, Hayley,

16:37.222 --> 16:38.423
while your 14-year-old brother

16:38.457 --> 16:40.008
drives your stoned husband's van.

16:40.059 --> 16:41.059
Real responsible.

16:41.093 --> 16:42.560
This is all your fault.

16:42.594 --> 16:45.146
Mom and Dad are never
gonna trust me again.

16:46.631 --> 16:47.849
Pull over!

16:47.883 --> 16:49.984
My God.
My God! What do I do?

16:50.019 --> 16:51.819
Just try to act older.

16:54.556 --> 16:55.923
Evening, Officer.

16:55.958 --> 16:57.792
Do you know why I pulled you over?

16:57.826 --> 17:00.928
Probably 'cause I prefer
the feel of a real newspaper.

17:00.963 --> 17:02.296
You're doing great.

17:02.331 --> 17:03.598
Let's go down the list:

17:03.632 --> 17:05.800
Tags expired, too young to drive,

17:05.834 --> 17:08.569
the drunk prostitute next to you
isn't wearing her seat belt.

17:08.604 --> 17:10.505
Hey!

17:10.539 --> 17:13.174
And it reeks of marijuana in here.

17:13.208 --> 17:15.259
That's me; that's mine.

17:15.294 --> 17:17.127
You're doing great.

17:17.162 --> 17:19.364
All right, everybody out of the car.

17:24.403 --> 17:27.571
I'm gonna kill you kids!

17:27.606 --> 17:29.190
What?! Why?!

17:29.224 --> 17:30.908
We had a deal.

17:30.943 --> 17:33.311
You said the receipt

17:33.345 --> 17:35.380
was in the bag.

17:35.414 --> 17:37.181
This is about the receipt?

17:37.199 --> 17:38.533
I can get it!

17:40.119 --> 17:42.653
Jenny!
Hey, it's me, Funny Cutie.

17:42.687 --> 17:44.906
Can I swing by?

17:44.957 --> 17:46.707
It's too late?

17:46.742 --> 17:49.877
Well, can I at least get your address

17:49.912 --> 17:52.547
so I can send you a fruit bouquet?

17:52.581 --> 17:55.767
Those are wonderful.

17:59.104 --> 18:00.238
Hey, beautiful.

18:00.272 --> 18:02.940
W-What the hell is...

18:02.975 --> 18:06.177
Baby, baby, baby, it's your boy, Steve.

18:06.211 --> 18:08.146
Where is it?!

18:08.180 --> 18:10.348
I-I need that receipt
I wrote my number on!

18:13.919 --> 18:17.021
Guys, hey, let me just say
I'm totally sorry, okay?

18:17.055 --> 18:18.222
You know what the thing is?

18:18.257 --> 18:20.491
I'm, like, really OCD
about my accounting,

18:20.526 --> 18:21.826
and I'm on a ton of meth,

18:21.860 --> 18:23.828
so, you know, I'm kind of erratic.

18:27.232 --> 18:29.267
You know, maybe this is
a wake-up call for me.

18:29.301 --> 18:31.102
I got to clean myself up, right?

18:31.136 --> 18:32.870
I should go back to school...

18:36.475 --> 18:38.476
My God, what have I done?

18:38.510 --> 18:41.395
This gun, I've never even
fired it before!

18:41.430 --> 18:43.698
I heard Jennifer scream
and everything went blank,

18:43.732 --> 18:45.566
and I killed a man!

18:45.601 --> 18:48.769
: Who am I
to take a life?!

18:48.804 --> 18:51.672
Am I beast or man?

18:51.707 --> 18:54.142
Beast!

18:54.176 --> 18:56.277
Daddy!

19:00.015 --> 19:02.750
Nooooo!

19:02.784 --> 19:05.720
Geez, get me out of here,

19:12.044 --> 19:14.295
Thank God they're not back yet.

19:14.329 --> 19:15.913
You guys should head home.

19:17.432 --> 19:21.319
So, we're not reporting any of
the murders we saw tonight?

19:21.353 --> 19:24.922
I'm cool with that, I'm just checking.

19:24.957 --> 19:26.824
Whoo! I'm out of gas.

19:26.859 --> 19:28.593
See you all in the morning.

19:30.395 --> 19:33.664
That's a folksy way
to say you're tired,

19:33.699 --> 19:34.732
I like that.

19:34.766 --> 19:36.300
Out of gas.

19:37.703 --> 19:39.170
Mom's car!

19:41.874 --> 19:43.441
I-I can't believe this.

19:43.475 --> 19:47.361
Mom and Dad were right...
I am irresponsible.

19:47.412 --> 19:49.947
I kind of didn't make it
any easier for you.

19:49.981 --> 19:51.832
But the only reason I snuck out

19:51.867 --> 19:53.367
was 'cause you called me a dweeb.

19:53.418 --> 19:55.369
I wanted to prove you wrong.

19:57.372 --> 20:00.041
My God... horses.

20:02.060 --> 20:04.929
They're coming!

20:08.200 --> 20:09.433
We're screwed.

20:09.468 --> 20:11.702
We'll never make it without a miracle.

20:25.234 --> 20:28.236
Goal!

20:35.978 --> 20:37.111
Hey, Mom, hey, Dad...

20:37.145 --> 20:38.279
Finger's up, shut up.

20:38.313 --> 20:40.848
How was she?

20:40.882 --> 20:43.517
You're supposed to ask
the babysitter how the kid was.

20:43.552 --> 20:44.552
Bup-bup-bup!

20:44.586 --> 20:45.720
Steve?

20:47.105 --> 20:50.007
She...

20:50.042 --> 20:51.442
She did great.

20:51.476 --> 20:52.777
Really responsible.

20:55.314 --> 20:57.048
I can't stop!
