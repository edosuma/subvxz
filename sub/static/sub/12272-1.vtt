Previously on CSl...

00:03.410 --> 00:04.600
GRISSOM: 
Her name is Natalie Davis.

00:04.770 --> 00:06.980
She works for our janitorial service.

00:07.160 --> 00:10.260
This girl holds me responsible 
for the death of Ernie Dell.

00:10.420 --> 00:13.280
I took away the only person
she ever loved

00:13.450 --> 00:15.370
so she's going to do 
the same thing to me.

00:15.540 --> 00:17.110
DAVIS: Sara?

00:20.210 --> 00:23.460
Stop this! Tell me where Sara is!

MAN (over radio): 
All units,444 in progress.

01:18.190 --> 01:19.500
Still no response from C-27.

01:19.680 --> 01:21.980
WFA, five foot-nine,120,brown-green.

01:22.150 --> 01:23.540
Last known location.

01:23.720 --> 01:26.600
Parking structure at Imperial
and Las Ved s Boulevard.

01:27.190 --> 01:29.290
SANDERS: There are two
cameras on each level.

01:29.460 --> 01:32.280
This eye has the best view of Sara's car.

01:32.880 --> 01:33.950
Great.

01:34.130 --> 01:36.110
Now if we could just see what it saw.

01:36.280 --> 01:37.270
Where are the damn tapes?

01:37.450 --> 01:38.280
Like I've been telling everyone,

01:38.470 --> 01:40.470
this is a strip mall not a casino.

01:40.640 --> 01:41.530
The feeds go off-site.

01:41.690 --> 01:43.250
My boss is bringing it right now.

01:43.410 --> 01:45.460
You recognize this woman?

01:46.340 --> 01:47.410
No.

01:47.570 --> 01:49.940
What about her?

01:50.210 --> 01:51.860
Yeah, she, uh, 
she eats at the veggie place

01:52.030 --> 01:53.690
a couple times a week, downstairs.

01:53.870 --> 01:55.360
When was she here tonight?

01:55.520 --> 01:57.390
I don't know, like 7:30,maybe.

01:57.550 --> 01:58.910
That's when she usually comes.

01:59.080 --> 02:00.650
That gives us the time frame.

02:00.820 --> 02:03.650
I'll take care of the tapes.

02:42.590 --> 02:45.450
Lots of desert landscape drawings

02:45.710 --> 02:47.020
STOKES: The whole city's a desert.

02:47.200 --> 02:49.380
Could be anywhere.

02:57.280 --> 02:59.510
Warrick, take a look at this.

03:01.820 --> 03:04.040
In those photos of Natalie
observing Grissom and Sara

03:04.180 --> 03:06.750
at the crime scene, I never
remember a sketch pad

03:06.910 --> 03:08.390
or a camera in her hand or
anything like that.

03:08.560 --> 03:09.910
You saying she drew this from memory?

03:10.080 --> 03:11.670
Well, maybe she's eidetic.

03:11.840 --> 03:13.200
You know, a human camera.

03:13.370 --> 03:15.760
The eyes snap a photo,
scan it to the brain.

03:15.930 --> 03:16.500
Great.

03:16.680 --> 03:19.960
Sara's location is probably locked
away inside of her head.

03:43.250 --> 03:44.710
Brown.

03:45.670 --> 03:47.710
Great. I'll take it.

03:47.870 --> 03:49.570
Keep it there.

03:49.750 --> 03:51.810
They found Natalie's car on
Fremont Street.

03:51.980 --> 03:53.050
All right, go ahead.

03:53.230 --> 03:55.360
I'm not leaving here till I find something.

04:03.360 --> 04:05.790
BRASS: I just got off the horn with
Search and Rescue.

04:05.950 --> 04:09.310
We have three choppers in the air
with night vision and IR.

04:09.480 --> 04:10.700
The weather's getting cooler,

04:10.860 --> 04:13.220
so a warm body will be easier to find.

04:13.400 --> 04:15.920
If Sara's under the car,
the metal will conceal her.

04:16.060 --> 04:17.839
Maybe she got out.

04:18.010 --> 04:19.630
MAN (on TV): They've just issued
a severe weather alert

04:19.800 --> 04:22.780
for North Las Vegas,
so let's go right to Gina

04:22.960 --> 04:24.540
for the latest on these thunderstorms.

04:24.690 --> 04:25.970
GINA:
Three thunderstorms are converging

04:26.140 --> 04:27.430
and heading right for us.

04:27.590 --> 04:28.980
So, up to three inches of rain.

04:29.150 --> 04:30.940
They're expected to hit in the
next eight hours.

04:31.140 --> 04:33.030
Flash flood warnings have
been issued for the city

04:33.200 --> 04:35.760
and surrounding desert areas.

07:16.780 --> 07:17.870
What do you know, Nick?

07:18.040 --> 07:19.580
STOKES: Compassroute. Com.

07:19.740 --> 07:21.460
Natalie's been spending
a lot of time in the desert.

07:21.620 --> 07:24.080
About a dozen different spots,
all off the beaten path.

07:24.280 --> 07:26.940
No roads, just general locations.

07:27.120 --> 07:28.100
Hang on.

07:28.260 --> 07:29.950
Warrick, how far was the last trip?

07:30.120 --> 07:32.890
Give me a second,
I'm getting it right now.

07:33.580 --> 07:36.010
34 miles, one way.

07:36.190 --> 07:38.900
Nick, get all those locations to Brass.

07:39.070 --> 07:40.430
Tell him to focus his search

07:40.590 --> 07:43.590
on any destination within 34 miles.

07:43.770 --> 07:45.130
Done.

07:58.740 --> 08:00.880
CURTIS:
She has wounds on her scalp.

08:01.050 --> 08:03.410
Swab for DNA and trace.

08:03.580 --> 08:04.960
No scumbag defense attorney

08:05.130 --> 08:07.590
is going to make their
reputation setting her free.

08:07.750 --> 08:09.910
DR. KACHLER:
A blow to the head can cause many things...

08:10.090 --> 08:11.540
memory toss...

08:11.710 --> 08:13.300
delirium...

08:13.480 --> 08:15.120
dementia.

08:17.020 --> 08:19.200
But not psychosis.

08:21.280 --> 08:23.290
(quietly): They wouldn't understand.

08:23.700 --> 08:25.250
She said something.

08:25.460 --> 08:27.230
She's not talking to you.

08:27.410 --> 08:29.350
Or anyone else here.

08:29.860 --> 08:31.670
This patient is exhibiting all the signs

08:31.840 --> 08:33.970
of a psychotic break:
Delusions, hallucinations,

08:34.130 --> 08:35.539
disorganized thought.

08:35.710 --> 08:37.380
How long is she going toe like this?

08:37.549 --> 08:38.059
Days.

08:38.230 --> 08:39.360
Months.

08:39.549 --> 08:39.980
Any longer,

08:40.159 --> 08:42.549
we're looking at schizophrenia.

08:50.200 --> 08:52.140
(quietly): I promise.

08:53.670 --> 08:56.380
Your special girl.

09:21.160 --> 09:22.300
Did you find something?

09:22.460 --> 09:23.820
Taser barb.

09:24.000 --> 09:27.010
It doesn't tell us where, just how.

09:30.350 --> 09:31.510
Hello, Gilbert.

09:31.690 --> 09:33.460
GRISSOM: Sara, we got an
I.D. On the miniature killer.

09:33.620 --> 09:35.210
Her name is Natalie Davis.

09:35.380 --> 09:36.670
One of Ernie Dell's fosters?

09:36.850 --> 09:39.350
Yeah. Catherine and I just
poke to the biological father.

09:39.520 --> 09:41.390
He says he put Natalie up for adoption

09:41.560 --> 09:44.110
after she shoved her kid sister
out of a tree house.

09:44.270 --> 09:45.610
Does he know where she is now?

09:45.800 --> 09:48.220
No, but with a name,
it's just a matter of time.

09:48.410 --> 09:49.310
All right, I'll be right there.

09:49.470 --> 09:51.220
I'll meet you at the lab.

09:59.960 --> 10:01.370
Sara?

10:44.000 --> 10:46.230
She west on Imperial.

10:50.400 --> 10:51.620
Jim.

10:51.650 --> 10:55.290
????

15:54.210 --> 15:55.920
????

15:56.110 --> 15:57.150
Aused a lot of problems,

15:57.330 --> 15:59.750
one of the biggest storms
we've seen over the past few years.

15:59.940 --> 16:01.550
Mudslides are already a big problem

16:01.730 --> 16:04.200
for the Valley and most areas
will be evacuated,

16:04.390 --> 16:08.290
especially low-lying areas,
so stay tuned.

18:00.060 --> 18:01.160
Grissom.

18:02.670 --> 18:03.580
A zip-tie...

18:03.750 --> 18:05.050
unlocked.

18:05.390 --> 18:07.770
I thk Sara got out of this trunk.

18:07.930 --> 18:10.170
The speaker's completely
ripped out from the inside.

18:10.350 --> 18:10.950
She could have reached through

18:11.120 --> 18:12.760
and released the backseat.

18:12.950 --> 18:15.120
And there's blood on the glass.

18:15.300 --> 18:16.650
There could have been a struggle.

18:16.830 --> 18:18.900
GRISSOM: Yeah, but none of that's
going to tell us where she is.

18:19.070 --> 18:21.180
We need a store receipt or
a parking stub,

18:21.360 --> 18:22.470
something with a location on it.

18:22.640 --> 18:25.810
If she got out of this car, she might
not even be in the desert.

18:25.980 --> 18:27.390
We might be completely off base here.

18:27.540 --> 18:28.300
No.

18:28.460 --> 18:29.660
Natalie completed the miniature.

18:29.820 --> 18:31.890
I saw it in her eyes.

18:32.060 --> 18:34.070
Sara is under that car.

18:34.740 --> 18:37.160
Pollen spores off the bumper
and Natalie's head

18:37.340 --> 18:40.740
both overlap in Red Rock Canyon.

18:41.090 --> 18:42.490
Did you notify S & R?

18:42.640 --> 18:44.250
Yeah, they're

19:09.690 --> 19:11.480
Natalie.

19:12.940 --> 19:14.670
Natalie Davis.

19:15.970 --> 19:17.650
I know who you are.

19:17.940 --> 19:20.640
I know a lot about you.

19:22.000 --> 19:24.030
You make miniatures.

19:26.580 --> 19:29.120
I've seen you before, right?

19:31.430 --> 19:35.670
You work in the lab on the
cleaning crew.

19:38.390 --> 19:42.110
So sorry about hitting you back there.

19:42.280 --> 19:44.160
I guess, uh...

19:44.840 --> 19:48.190
I have a fear of trunks.

19:48.810 --> 19:51.680
In my business, you only find
one thing in them.

19:57.460 --> 20:00.820
We actually have a lot in
common, you know?

20:01.320 --> 20:03.940
I was a foster kid, too.

20:04.610 --> 20:07.260
Happy, happy, joy, joy.

20:10.280 --> 20:13.590
I do know what it's like to be alone...

20:14.560 --> 20:18.070
afraid that nobody's ever going
to be there for you.

20:18.230 --> 20:20.220
Ernie was.

20:22.230 --> 20:24.710
Yes, he was.

20:24.880 --> 20:27.640
That's true, Natalie.

20:30.480 --> 20:30.850
I lost

20:31.030 --> 20:33.510
my father, too.

20:38.000 --> 20:41.690
I know that Ernie loved you.

20:41.860 --> 20:43.640
He would not have wanted you to do this.

20:43.820 --> 20:47.920
Ernie loved me more than
Grissom could ever love you.

20:48.100 --> 20:49.870
Grissom?

20:52.770 --> 20:56.080
Oh, I know what this is about.

20:56.540 --> 20:58.630
Natalie.

20:59.870 --> 21:01.810
What did you put in the water,

21:02.000 --> 21:04.100
Natalie?

21:05.840 --> 21:08.320
Huh?

21:15.890 --> 21:17.440
Natalie?

21:18.380 --> 21:20.310
Natalie, what are you doing?

21:21.590 --> 21:25.970
Natalie... what are you doing?

21:26.600 --> 21:27.480
Natalie?

21:32.140 --> 21:33.670
Don't do this.

21:36.750 --> 21:38.250
Natalie?

21:42.480 --> 21:44.340
Natalie.

21:45.880 --> 21:48.660
Natalie!

24:02.800 --> 24:04.790
<i>SIDLE: You think she's alive.</i>

24:04.970 --> 24:07.400
You're acting like you're goingto resc

24:07.570 --> 24:11.480
not recover a body, and on this job

24:11.660 --> 24:14.670
that's just not usually the case.

24:16.130 --> 24:18.520
I was rescued.

24:19.270 --> 24:21.840
It was not your day to die.

24:22.030 --> 24:26.600
When it's your day, it's your day, you know?

24:59.580 --> 25:01.860
DESERT DIAMOND AUTO YARD 555.0737

25:23.870 --> 25:25.290
Hey, buddy.

25:25.460 --> 25:26.990
I'm in a hurry.

25:30.110 --> 25:34.050
This girl bought a red Mustang
off our impound lot.

25:34.220 --> 25:35.940
Yeah, couple of, couple of weeks
ago, right,

25:36.110 --> 25:36.950
for, for art.

25:37.130 --> 25:38.150
Who the hell is Art?

25:38.330 --> 25:39.120
No, she's an artist.

25:39.300 --> 25:40.410
She thinks all this stuff is art.

25:40.600 --> 25:41.950
Yeah, where'd you take it?

25:42.230 --> 25:42.800
I don't know.

25:42.970 --> 25:44.190
It was dark, I followed the taillights.

25:44.360 --> 25:45.860
Wait a minute, you towed a
3,500-pound car,

25:46.030 --> 25:47.730
you can't remember where you took it?

25:47.900 --> 25:49.120
Well, w-what's going on?

25:49.290 --> 25:51.450
Look, you towed a car for a serial killer.

25:51.630 --> 25:52.670
That makes you an accomplice.

25:52.850 --> 25:54.600
You helped abduct one of my people.

25:54.780 --> 25:56.380
Now, you either tell me where you took it

25:56.570 --> 25:57.500
or you're going to end up in the hospital

25:57.680 --> 25:59.530
and after that you're going to end up in jail.

25:59.690 --> 26:00.960
???

26:01.120 --> 26:02.490
Come on, focus.

26:02.650 --> 26:06.000
Um... Ice Box Canyon.

26:06.160 --> 26:08.120
All right, h-hey, look, look.

26:08.510 --> 26:10.020
Look, this is a map.

26:10.170 --> 26:11.930
Show me on the map.

26:51.640 --> 26:52.550
To the left.

26:52.720 --> 26:53.930
Down there.

26:54.110 --> 26:55.890
That's it, that's it, that's it.

26:56.290 --> 26:57.290
Control, Air Three.

26:57.470 --> 26:59.440
We are 20 miles west of the 159,

26:59.620 --> 27:01.350
near Ice Box Canyon.

27:01.520 --> 27:03.380
Red-colored vehicle spotted.

27:03.550 --> 27:05.060
Fits the description.

27:32.767 --> 27:34.667
Sara Sara

28:10.170 --> 28:10.970
????

28:11.140 --> 28:12.940
She's not here.

28:13.580 --> 28:14.680
Okay, that's good news.

28:14.840 --> 28:16.480
Guys, park rangers said
there's some roads

28:16.650 --> 28:17.540
on the other side of this basin.

28:17.720 --> 28:18.720
We're g! Ng to go scout them.

28:22.480 --> 28:26.140
????

28:33.570 --> 28:35.730
That means she got out
from under the car.

28:35.910 --> 28:37.510
Everybody listen up.

00:00.040 --> 00:00.080
Come on, guys.

33:44.180 --> 33:46.100
I'm not seeing any more
footprints, are you?

33:46.280 --> 33:47.830
No.

33:49.000 --> 33:51.380
I think we just lost the trail.

34:00.650 --> 34:02.730
Cath, look. What?

34:17.870 --> 34:20.350
This is better than a footprint.

34:44.600 --> 34:45.969
Yeah.

34:50.429 --> 34:52.580
Good girl.

34:56.639 --> 34:58.770
You see another one?

35:01.320 --> 35:02.180
Oh, no.

35:02.350 --> 35:04.070
What?

35:37.570 --> 35:38.630
Oh...

35:39.780 --> 35:42.150
It's not her.

35:46.260 --> 35:48.319
???

35:48.320 --> 35:51.780
To Red Rock Canyon on a
419 accidental.

35:51.940 --> 35:53.720
????

35:53.890 --> 35:56.010
????

35:57.660 --> 35:59.520
Park Service issued him a
camping permit.

35:59.650 --> 36:02.060
He was supposed to hike out this morning.

36:02.450 --> 36:04.430
Must have got caught in the flash flood.

36:04.600 --> 36:07.050
Couldn't make it to higher ground.

36:10.410 --> 36:12.730
Where is she, Catherine?

36:12.880 --> 36:14.070
It's 110 degrees.

36:14.240 --> 36:17.650
She's been out here all day, without water.

36:18.050 --> 36:21.820
She's disoriented, she's dehydrated.

36:22.340 --> 36:24.450
She's a survivor.

36:28.530 --> 36:30.250
SIDLE (weakly): Just keep going.

36:30.430 --> 36:31.870
Don't stop.

36:35.850 --> 36:37.360
Three times four is...

36:37.400 --> 36:39.260
(weakly): Keep walking.

36:39.330 --> 36:42.530
Keep walk...

36:42.600 --> 36:45.800
Four times five is 20.

36:49.800 --> 36:52.660
Four times four is... What is it?

36:52.730 --> 36:55.060
Sixteen. Sixteen.

36:55.130 --> 36:58.660
Four times five...

36:58.730 --> 37:01.730
Four times five...

37:06.030 --> 37:08.860
four times five is 20.

37:08.930 --> 37:11.100
(weakly): Keep walking...

37:11.160 --> 37:13.930
Keep walking.

37:13.960 --> 37:17.600
Four times five is

37:32.550 --> 37:33.850
Get up.

37:38.610 --> 37:40.920
Get up. Don't sleep.

37:41.520 --> 37:43.330
Don't sleep.

37:48.990 --> 37:52.240
(quietly): Don't sleep... don't sleep.

37:52.410 --> 37:53.750
Stay awake.

37:54.060 --> 37:56.090
Stay awake.

38:01.760 --> 38:04.630
I... just don't sleep.

38:40.430 --> 38:42.800
Wait, slow down, slow down, slow down.

38:44.520 --> 38:46.290
CURTIS: What is it?

38:47.590 --> 38:49.040
Go that way.

38:49.200 --> 38:50.440
Go.

39:03.230 --> 39:05.040
Sara

39:05.870 --> 39:08.530
????

39:09.870 --> 39:10.630
I can't get a pulse.

39:10.800 --> 39:11.320
We found Sara.

39:11.490 --> 39:13.480
North on the 159 at Turtlehead Peak.

39:13.650 --> 39:15.500
We need a medevac out here right now.

39:15.660 --> 39:18.470
Don't worry, we're going to get
you out of here, okay?

39:31.050 --> 39:32.590
They're coming for you now.

39:32.770 --> 39:34.610
You're going to be okay,

39:39.580 --> 39:40.580
Here!

39:44.630 --> 39:45.680
MEDIC: What have you got?

39:45.850 --> 39:49.530

39:49.840 --> 39:52.180

39:54.930 --> 39:56.200

39:59.810 --> 40:02.280
Put her on 15 liters.

40:02.460 --> 40:05.670
Give me an I.V. Prep tag. I.V.

40:05.770 --> 40:08.020
Possible fracture, left arm.

40:17.080 --> 40:19.190
Copy that. How's the back look?
Anything?

40:19.360 --> 40:20.530
Cervical's good, spine's good.

40:21.400 --> 40:23.800
Do me a favor.
Hold that piece of tape.

40:29.160 --> 40:30.890
Get the arm in there.

40:31.060 --> 40:34.390
On my count. One, two, three.

40:39.740 --> 40:41.190
Let's go...

40:48.290 --> 40:49.460
Where are you taking her?

40:49.630 --> 40:50.960
Desert Palm!

40:51.120 --> 40:53.730
Move over! I'm going with her!

41:17.390 --> 41:17.920
Switch off the oxygen.

41:18.090 --> 41:18.860
