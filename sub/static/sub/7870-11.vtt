upon this town,

01:59.661 --> 02:02.163

02:28.022 --> 02:30.733

04:35.858 --> 04:38.027
at lunch, I get a massage
in front of strangers;

04:38.111 --> 04:40.780
and then I spend the afternoon

some shopping as a family.

04:55.044 --> 04:56.254

his own excitement.

05:00.466 --> 05:02.927
Give me one doll
from every time period,

05:03.011 --> 05:05.138
and set me up for a tea party
in a private room.

05:05.221 --> 05:08.224
Lenny, you asked me to stop you
from coming back in here.

05:08.308 --> 05:09.976
Let me help you.

05:10.059 --> 05:13.563
You can help me by giving me
Ellis Island Emily.

05:15.982 --> 05:17.942

fix your teeth,
send you to the best schools,

05:19.986 --> 05:21.988
and you're going to hate
and resent me for it

05:22.071 --> 05:24.324
'cause you're an American now.

05:25.658 --> 05:28.911
I was hanging on to these
gift cards as investments,

05:28.995 --> 05:31.247
but then half the companies
went out of business.

05:31.331 --> 05:33.124

06:18.419 --> 06:20.797

06:32.058 --> 06:33.643
Yo, Bart dude.

06:33.726 --> 06:34.852

06:34.936 --> 06:36.229

06:38.940 --> 06:40.942
(grunts)

06:47.782 --> 06:48.783
Hmm.

06:48.866 --> 06:50.618
I kind of want to
create my own thing.

06:50.701 --> 06:52.954
Do you sell
any just plain sets?

06:53.037 --> 06:55.081
No.
We do all the imagining for you.

06:55.164 --> 06:56.916
(sighs)
Well, I'll just buy one of these

06:56.999 --> 06:58.209
and build something
different.

06:58.292 --> 07:00.962
You do and you'd better
build yourself a lawyer.

07:01.045 --> 07:04.132
<i>LAWYER: Miss Simpson,</i>
<i>does the court really need to hear</i>

07:04.215 --> 07:05.758
everything that happened

your family visited?

07:08.386 --> 07:12.098
Trust me, I've left a lot out
and cleaned up the swears.

07:12.181 --> 07:14.100
Anyway,
I ran into some schoolmates

07:14.183 --> 07:15.601
and thought they
might be friendly.

07:15.685 --> 07:18.896
That's what kids do, right,
hang out at the mall together?

07:18.980 --> 07:19.981
But when I went over...

07:20.064 --> 07:22.567
Hi, guys,
what are you doing?

07:22.650 --> 07:25.820
Duh, having feathers
woven into our hair.

07:25.903 --> 07:28.239
<i>LISA'S BRAIN: Those girls</i>

07:31.492 --> 07:32.994
(Lisa's brain groans)

07:33.077 --> 07:36.164
Lisa, how can we put this?

07:36.247 --> 07:39.500
You're the reason no one wears
Silly Bandz anymore.

07:39.584 --> 07:42.336
Wha...?
They, they don't?

07:42.420 --> 07:43.504

07:43.588 --> 07:45.673

(sighs sadly)

07:47.258 --> 07:48.843
(moans)

07:48.926 --> 07:50.386
Enough.

07:53.598 --> 07:55.266
I don't trust this place.

07:55.349 --> 07:57.018

07:57.101 --> 07:59.187
Huh? Oh.

07:59.270 --> 08:01.272
Huh?
Oh.

08:01.355 --> 08:03.941
Yeah, the lightest,
most desirable computer

08:04.025 --> 08:08.279
in the world for the next
three weeks: the Mapple Void.

08:10.573 --> 08:13.993
I'll take it,
provided you charge me

08:14.076 --> 08:16.829
for services
that Google offers for free.

08:16.913 --> 08:19.332
-I already have.
-Sweet.

08:20.833 --> 08:23.044
This computer is so great.

08:23.127 --> 08:25.004
I'm watching the latest
Sofia Coppola movie

08:25.087 --> 08:28.382
at 20x speed to make it seem
like a normal movie.

08:28.466 --> 08:29.926
I think it just froze.

08:30.009 --> 08:33.262
Oh, no, no,
that bird just moved.

08:33.346 --> 08:36.432
Uh-oh, a draggy backpack.

08:36.516 --> 08:38.684
I have no friends.

08:38.768 --> 08:42.313
Aw, sweetie, hey,
why don't you make friends

08:42.396 --> 08:43.606
with my new computer?

08:43.689 --> 08:45.650
-Okay.
-Let me just finish downloading

08:45.733 --> 08:47.276
the complete works
of Shakespeare.

08:47.360 --> 08:51.197
(humming)

08:51.280 --> 08:52.615
(sneaky chuckle)

08:52.698 --> 08:55.785
Now who's the greatest writer
of all time?

08:58.955 --> 09:01.290
I'd have more friends
if I knew what people liked,

09:01.374 --> 09:03.960
but I won't know what people like
unless I'm their friend.

09:04.043 --> 09:05.461
It's a conundrum.

09:05.545 --> 09:07.171
Helpful hint:
If you want friends,

09:07.255 --> 09:09.257
don't use words like "conundrum."

09:09.340 --> 09:10.424
(phone rings)

09:10.508 --> 09:12.385
<i>-JIMBO: Co-what-drum?</i>
-Jimbo heard me say it.

09:12.468 --> 09:13.469
I'm dead.

09:21.894 --> 09:23.396
Hmm.

09:29.569 --> 09:32.822
It's easier to be friends
with lots of people online

09:32.905 --> 09:34.991
than one person in person.

09:35.074 --> 09:37.159
What if I started
an online meeting place

09:37.243 --> 09:41.622
where all are equal
and I am the undisputed center?

09:42.540 --> 09:44.166
(both grunting)

09:44.250 --> 09:46.877
How's this for a conundrum?

09:46.961 --> 09:48.254
It's not really a conundrum.

09:48.337 --> 09:51.173
Sit at my feet,
and I will elaborate.

09:55.970 --> 09:57.972
So, to summarize, Your Honor,

09:58.055 --> 10:02.018
Lisa Simpson created
this "social network"

10:02.101 --> 10:05.104
because she had no friends.

10:05.187 --> 10:07.523
No, that is not true. I...

10:07.607 --> 10:08.941
May I remind you
you're under oath?

10:09.025 --> 10:10.735
All right already.

10:10.818 --> 10:11.861
I had no friends.

10:11.944 --> 10:15.698
With a attitude like that,
I wouldn't be her friend.

10:15.781 --> 10:18.534
Life is too dang short.

10:18.618 --> 10:21.621
So, since I had no friends,
I assembled a motley crew

10:21.704 --> 10:24.874
of the friendless to help me
construct my social network.

10:24.957 --> 10:27.043
Did we become friends?
No.

10:27.126 --> 10:29.253
(overlapping chatter)

10:32.173 --> 10:35.051
As the CEO of SpringFace,
I want you all to have fun

10:35.134 --> 10:36.552
as you write source code

10:36.636 --> 10:38.387
until you fall asleep
at your consoles.

10:38.471 --> 10:39.639
-(all agreeing)
-Delightful.

10:39.722 --> 10:43.267
Here's my favorite
computer game: Angry Nerds.

10:43.351 --> 10:45.186
(squawks)

10:45.269 --> 10:46.646
(all snorting like pigs)

10:46.729 --> 10:50.900
Nelson, is there any way
I could be your friend?

10:50.983 --> 10:53.277
The only way
I would be your friend

10:53.361 --> 10:55.988
is if I could click a box
under your picture saying

10:56.072 --> 10:58.574
"Accept friendship request from."

10:58.658 --> 11:01.994
Nelson, you've just given us
the template for our site.

11:02.078 --> 11:04.497
I don't care.

11:04.580 --> 11:05.498
(grunts)

11:05.581 --> 11:07.333
(clatter like bowling pins)

11:07.416 --> 11:09.543
(groans)

11:10.503 --> 11:13.047
If we don't move,
his odds of getting us both

11:13.130 --> 11:15.424
are 374 to one.

11:16.967 --> 11:18.344
Ooh-oo-ooh, ooh.

11:18.427 --> 11:20.596
(grunts)
Bye.

11:20.680 --> 11:23.182
(keyboards clatter)

11:23.265 --> 11:24.892
Now, to skip ahead,

11:24.975 --> 11:28.104
your diabolical plan
was an instant success.

11:28.187 --> 11:30.356
I never said it was diabolical.

11:30.439 --> 11:32.024
Withdrawn.

11:33.776 --> 11:35.778
This social network
quickly unified

11:35.861 --> 11:39.448
the disparate children
of Springfield Unified.

11:39.532 --> 11:42.535
Oh, I just got invited
to make out with Shauna.

11:42.618 --> 11:43.703
See?

11:43.786 --> 11:46.288
That went out to 200 guys.

11:46.372 --> 11:47.540
(groans)

11:47.623 --> 11:49.041
And seven girls.

11:49.125 --> 11:50.376
(brightly)
Oh...

11:50.459 --> 11:52.128
Santa's Little Helper's friends

11:52.211 --> 11:54.130
with Snowball Two?

11:54.213 --> 11:55.715
Now I've seen everything.

11:55.798 --> 11:59.051
Ha, all my friends
have birthdays this year.

11:59.135 --> 12:00.219
(typing)

12:00.302 --> 12:01.637
(click)

12:01.721 --> 12:03.973
(chuckles)
I just un-friended Skinner

12:04.056 --> 12:06.308
Doggone it.
I'm less popular

12:06.392 --> 12:08.144
than the hornet's nest
in the gym.

12:08.227 --> 12:10.229
You said you were
getting rid of that nest.

12:10.312 --> 12:12.690
We trade the honey
for chalk and yardsticks.

12:12.773 --> 12:13.649
Hornets make honey?

12:13.733 --> 12:15.943
Better than wasp honey,
not as good as bee.

12:16.026 --> 12:17.695
Is this how
you talk on dates?

12:17.778 --> 12:19.488
I wish my dates
were this interesting.

12:20.990 --> 12:21.991
Hit refresh.

12:22.074 --> 12:23.242
-(click)
-Hit refresh.

12:23.325 --> 12:25.244
(gasps)
I have a thousand friends.

12:25.327 --> 12:27.496
And only eight
of them are Milhouse.

12:27.580 --> 12:28.998
A thousand kids?

12:29.081 --> 12:31.125
If you could get each of them
to send you a dollar,

12:31.208 --> 12:32.251
you'd be a millionaire.

12:32.334 --> 12:34.962
Well, it's not just
kids using SpringFace,

12:35.045 --> 12:37.423
it's moms like me, Marge.

12:37.506 --> 12:40.050
Wait a minute,
grown-ups are on this?

12:40.134 --> 12:41.677
Yeah, look.

12:48.100 --> 12:49.894
We've got to thank you, kiddo.

12:49.977 --> 12:52.521
We've gotten so much more
action since we signed up

12:52.605 --> 12:54.273
and used this picture
of ourselves.

12:54.356 --> 12:55.524
(raspy chuckling)

12:55.608 --> 12:56.859
-That's not you.
-You can see

12:56.942 --> 13:00.279
our reflection
in the sunglasses.

13:00.362 --> 13:02.114
(chuckling)

13:02.198 --> 13:05.701
Wow, I've created something
incredibly popular.

13:05.785 --> 13:07.119
And I've created something

13:07.203 --> 13:09.371
that created something
incredibly popular.

13:09.455 --> 13:11.332
And I created
an alcoholic hippo.

13:11.415 --> 13:12.875
You never showed it to me.

13:12.958 --> 13:15.002
A stupid alcoholic hippo.

13:15.085 --> 13:17.630
-I still want to see it.
-There is no hippo.

13:17.713 --> 13:18.923
Then why did you say it?

13:19.006 --> 13:20.800
'Cause you're the hippo.

13:20.883 --> 13:22.009
Are you just saying that

13:22.092 --> 13:23.511
'cause you don't want me
to see the hippo?

13:23.594 --> 13:25.638
I don't have a hippo!

13:28.724 --> 13:32.269
And so, this so-called
"SpringFace"

13:32.353 --> 13:34.980
spread from the world
of children to adults.

13:35.064 --> 13:37.942
Man, this Web site
makes talking drunk

13:38.025 --> 13:40.069
to my wife so much safer.

13:40.152 --> 13:42.738
I am sitting here...

13:42.822 --> 13:45.282
zero sheets to the wind...

13:45.366 --> 13:46.909
(sneaky chuckle)

13:46.992 --> 13:49.245
<i>HOMER: ...counting the moments</i>
<i>to closing time</i>

13:49.328 --> 13:51.413
<i>when I can stumble home to you.</i>

13:51.497 --> 13:53.082
<i>Another round, Moe.</i>

13:53.165 --> 13:54.750
<i>Uh-oh, did I type that?</i>

13:54.834 --> 13:56.418
<i>Delete! Delete!</i>

13:56.502 --> 13:59.088
<i>Hmm, typing "delete"</i>
<i>does not delete.</i>

13:59.171 --> 14:00.339
(puzzled groan)

14:00.422 --> 14:04.301
It is gratifying to see
all of you bowing in prayer,

14:04.385 --> 14:07.972
the light of God
shining on your faces.

14:08.055 --> 14:12.059
Uh-oh, Bernice Hibbert keeps
"liking" Bumblebee Man's posts.

14:12.142 --> 14:15.020
That's how it starts.
Tsk-tsk-tsk-tsk-tsk.

14:15.104 --> 14:18.232
Why did I make this church
a Wi-Fi hotspot?

14:18.315 --> 14:21.026
(groans)
If you can't beat 'em, join 'em.

14:21.110 --> 14:24.113
Let's see, which Muppet am I?

14:24.196 --> 14:25.489
Beaker?

14:25.573 --> 14:27.116
Hm, I guess that's fair.

14:27.199 --> 14:28.993
Friend, friend,

14:29.076 --> 14:31.161
awaiting reply, friend...

14:31.245 --> 14:32.454
Sherri? Terri?

14:32.538 --> 14:33.831
Hopscotch?

14:33.914 --> 14:35.708
Double Dutch?
Ringolivio?

14:35.791 --> 14:38.335
Anyone?

14:41.005 --> 14:43.132
Oh, I have a thousand friends,

14:43.215 --> 14:45.009
and I feel more alone than ever.

14:45.092 --> 14:46.260
Whee!

14:46.343 --> 14:48.429
I am trying
to set a mood here.

14:48.512 --> 14:49.805
(somberly)
Whee.

14:49.889 --> 14:51.724
So, to sum up,

14:51.807 --> 14:53.392
Lisa's social network

14:53.475 --> 14:56.270
turned into the biggest
Internet failure since...

14:56.353 --> 14:58.397
(chuckles)
Well, there've been so many.

14:58.480 --> 15:00.065
"Ask Jeeves," anyone?

15:00.149 --> 15:02.860
(raucous laughter)

15:13.078 --> 15:15.414
(horse neighs)

15:21.503 --> 15:25.174
And so SpringFace became
too big to control,

15:25.257 --> 15:28.677
just like the 60-foot baby
in my self-published novel,

15:28.761 --> 15:30.012
<i>The 60 Ft. Baby.</i>

15:30.095 --> 15:32.222
Order it online now,
while you can still cheat

15:32.306 --> 15:34.058
the government on sales tax.

15:34.141 --> 15:36.518
(clears throat)
As I was saying,

15:36.602 --> 15:39.688
SpringFace was used
in ways I never expected.

15:39.772 --> 15:41.440
(typing)

15:41.523 --> 15:43.943
(video game gunfire)

15:44.026 --> 15:46.946
Thanks for SpringFacing me
your head cleaver, Bart.

15:47.029 --> 15:48.906
(screaming)

15:48.989 --> 15:50.699
(magazine reloading)

15:50.783 --> 15:51.700
(gunfire)

15:51.784 --> 15:53.285
(screaming)

15:53.369 --> 15:55.871
Check this out: I'm hiding
a bomb in this pile of corpses,

15:55.955 --> 15:57.665
so when Kearney
loots their ammo,

15:57.748 --> 15:59.750
he gets a face full
of ass shrapnel.

15:59.833 --> 16:01.168
(explosion)

16:01.251 --> 16:03.045
Damn, I got ass-shrapped!

16:03.128 --> 16:04.380
(groans)

16:06.423 --> 16:07.883
(tires squealing)

16:07.967 --> 16:09.176
What the...?!

16:09.259 --> 16:11.095
That idiot cut me off.

16:11.178 --> 16:12.596
(camera clicks)
I'm gonna run his plates,

16:12.680 --> 16:16.225
find out who he is, then change
his SpringFace profile picture

16:16.308 --> 16:17.810
to a shot of a monkey.

16:17.893 --> 16:19.228
(chuckles)
Get that, Marge?

16:19.311 --> 16:20.771
A monkey!

16:20.854 --> 16:22.982
-Homer, watch the road.
-Right.

16:23.065 --> 16:26.026
Status update: Homer...
is... watching... the...

16:26.110 --> 16:26.986

16:27.069 --> 16:28.737

16:28.821 --> 16:30.155

16:30.239 --> 16:32.074

16:32.157 --> 16:34.243

16:34.326 --> 16:36.203
Dislike! Dislike!

16:36.286 --> 16:38.414
-(thud)
-(sirens wail)

16:42.960 --> 16:44.336
(sirens wailing,
tires squealing)

16:44.420 --> 16:46.880
(tires screeching,
cars crashing, glass shattering)

16:47.589 --> 16:48.924
Somebody call 911!

16:49.008 --> 16:51.510
I don't know how to use
the phone on my phone.

16:53.095 --> 16:55.139
Hey, did you guys get
my picture of the fire?

16:55.222 --> 16:56.348
Yeah, I did;
nice grab.

16:56.432 --> 16:58.934
-I didn't get it yet.
-Yeah, funny how that works.

16:59.018 --> 17:02.021
Lisa Simpson,
can you give us any reason

17:02.104 --> 17:05.607
why the city should not force
you to shut down your site?

17:05.691 --> 17:08.986
I know it's awful and insular

17:09.069 --> 17:12.364
and caused 35 deaths,
but I had friends.

17:12.448 --> 17:14.616
Four digits of friends!

17:14.700 --> 17:17.286
I had a friend in common
with Malcolm Gladwell.

17:17.369 --> 17:19.121
He friends everybody.

17:19.204 --> 17:21.540
Fine.
I'll shut down the site.

17:55.240 --> 17:57.534
Want to play Marco Polo

17:57.618 --> 17:59.745
We just realized you don't
have to play in a pool.

17:59.828 --> 18:01.080
You really want me?

18:01.163 --> 18:03.582

No. We want your Dad.

18:03.665 --> 18:06.335

they started
training a week ago.

18:48.961 --> 18:50.170
Why can't we pull away?

18:50.254 --> 18:51.922
Because we can't
stop concentrating

18:52.005 --> 18:53.924
on that $65 million
Facebook settlement,

18:54.007 --> 18:55.551
which somehow wasn't
enough for us.

18:55.634 --> 18:57.469
Even though we were rich
in the first place.

18:57.553 --> 19:00.430

So long, you big babies!

19:00.514 --> 19:02.307
Hope you like

<i>Once there was</i>

<i>This lad was trouble</i>

19:34.923 --> 19:38.427
<i>When it came to mischief,</i>

<i>Then one day</i>
<i>at school engulfed in ennui,</i>

<i>Bart dreamed of wrapping</i>
<i>the place in T.P.</i>

20:00.699 --> 20:04.036
<i>So off to the discount store</i>
<i>they did skulk.</i>

20:04.119 --> 20:07.789
<i>With the evil intent</i>
<i>of buying in bulk.</i>

20:07.873 --> 20:11.210
<i>They went to the school</i>
<i>and put up a ladder.</i>

20:11.293 --> 20:14.546
<i>Only to wait</i>
<i>for Milhouse's bladder.</i>

20:16.298 --> 20:20.552
<i>All that evening</i>
<i>they unfurled with delight.</i>

20:20.636 --> 20:23.889

20:23.972 --> 20:27.392
