WEBVTT

00:00.001 --> 00:01.014
Previously on "Faking It"...

00:01.016 --> 00:02.802
When I got outed
and lost my sponsorship,

00:02.804 --> 00:04.277
it was the worst day
of my life.

00:04.278 --> 00:05.745
Why don't you just tell Duke
you outed him?

00:05.746 --> 00:07.381
When you asked if any of it
was real, I only said no

00:07.383 --> 00:09.865
because my boss was listening.
I want you back.

00:09.867 --> 00:11.527
Since the drug bust,
we're broke.

00:11.529 --> 00:12.427
Why didn't you tell me?

00:12.429 --> 00:14.280
I'm living in the juice truck
in my back yard.

00:14.282 --> 00:15.241
It's humiliating.

00:15.243 --> 00:16.424
Does this have to be
the end?

00:16.426 --> 00:18.015
We're just
in different places, Amy.

00:18.017 --> 00:19.706
I just can't believe
it's over.

00:34.576 --> 00:36.843
Hey.
Morning.

00:36.844 --> 00:38.277
Hey.

00:38.278 --> 00:41.682
Uh, looks like we fell asleep
marathoning Sherlock.

00:41.683 --> 00:43.927
That explains my dream.

00:43.929 --> 00:46.759
Cumberbatch was making me
Eggs Benedict.

00:46.761 --> 00:48.322
Yeah-huh.

00:48.323 --> 00:50.510
Thanks for staying over
last night again.

00:50.512 --> 00:52.257
You've really helped me
through this breakup.

00:52.259 --> 00:53.694
Mm-hmm.

00:53.695 --> 00:54.994
You know it's Saturday.

00:54.995 --> 00:56.162
You don't have to rush
to school.

00:56.163 --> 00:58.490
Well, we told
Liam, Shane, and Duke

00:58.492 --> 01:00.367
we'd meet them
for coffee, remember?

01:00.368 --> 01:01.968
We did?

01:01.969 --> 01:03.769
I don't know what
I was thinking.

01:03.770 --> 01:05.605
Coffee's bad for you,
addictive really.

01:05.606 --> 01:07.606
It's basically a drug.

01:07.607 --> 01:11.056
Amy, you can't
wallow forever.

01:11.058 --> 01:12.333
Says who?

01:12.335 --> 01:14.460
Let's wallow together
forever.

01:14.462 --> 01:16.342
We need to resist
the inertia of this room

01:16.344 --> 01:18.618
and get into the world.

01:18.619 --> 01:21.555
You go.
Between "Shuke" and "Kiam,"

01:21.556 --> 01:24.057
I'll just be Amy,
the fifth wheel.

01:24.058 --> 01:24.858
Amy.

01:24.859 --> 01:26.397
Go, seriously.

01:26.399 --> 01:29.353
If I'm around any more
lovey-dovey crap, I might vomit.

01:29.355 --> 01:30.629
I miss your eyes.

01:30.630 --> 01:31.932
I miss your lips.

01:31.933 --> 01:33.055
I miss kissing you.

01:33.057 --> 01:34.835
I miss kissing you
in public.

01:34.836 --> 01:36.482
Me too, but we talked
about this.

01:36.484 --> 01:38.971
I know, if anyone found out,
we'd both be in hot water.

01:38.972 --> 01:41.641
You'd lose your job.
I'd lose my presidency.

01:41.642 --> 01:43.277
Hester hates you, Theo.

01:43.278 --> 01:46.713
Crap! I did it again.
I can't stop calling you Theo.

01:46.714 --> 01:48.382
Then don't.

01:48.383 --> 01:50.150
I've always liked the name.
That's why I picked it.

01:50.151 --> 01:52.652
Plus, I love the way
you say it.

01:52.653 --> 01:54.219
Theo, Theo, Theo.

01:55.321 --> 01:56.889
Oh. I was hoping
that would summon you,

01:56.890 --> 01:58.191
like Beetlejuice.

01:58.192 --> 01:59.925
Actually,
I was just there.

01:59.926 --> 02:02.729
Now, there might be a secret
note on your back porch.

02:02.730 --> 02:04.348
- For me?
- Yes.

02:04.350 --> 02:07.968
Ten points for gentility.
Hold, please.

02:09.770 --> 02:11.837
Look what I found, look.

02:11.838 --> 02:14.007
"I'm counting the hours
until I see you again."

02:14.008 --> 02:15.840
What is that?

02:15.842 --> 02:18.411
I don't know.
It's definitely not for me.

02:19.492 --> 02:22.449
Oh, my God, I know
exactly what this is.

02:22.450 --> 02:24.084
You do?

02:24.085 --> 02:27.956
My mom is having an affair.

02:27.958 --> 02:30.756
Sync and corrections by explosiveskull
www.addic7ed.com

02:30.758 --> 02:32.492
This blows.

02:32.493 --> 02:33.403
Isn't working
on the weekend

02:33.405 --> 02:34.978
more of a thing
for the service industry?

02:34.980 --> 02:37.630
Dad says when you love what
you do, every day is a weekend.

02:37.631 --> 02:39.399
Wow.
I think that's

02:39.400 --> 02:41.718
the first time I've ever heard
you use the D-word.

02:41.720 --> 02:42.802
After last week,
that's got to be

02:42.803 --> 02:43.903
some kind of breakthrough
or something.

02:43.904 --> 02:45.104
- Is it?
- Maybe it isn't.

02:45.105 --> 02:47.039
But I'm stuck stapling
on a Saturday,

02:47.040 --> 02:49.542
so I'm searching
for a silver lining.

02:49.543 --> 02:51.527
Ah, my two favorite interns.

02:51.529 --> 02:54.013
Looking good, Mr. B.
Have you been working out?

02:54.015 --> 02:56.983
Zita, would you excuse us
for a moment, please?

02:56.984 --> 02:58.284
No problem.
I'll just deliver these

02:58.285 --> 03:01.021
while you two "skwerk" it out.

03:02.790 --> 03:03.991
I like her.

03:03.992 --> 03:04.875
Ugh.

03:04.877 --> 03:06.225
No, I mean,
I like her for you.

03:06.226 --> 03:07.794
I'm seeing someone already,
remember?

03:07.795 --> 03:10.263
Yeah, Karma.
Yeah, I can't seem to forget.

03:10.264 --> 03:12.399
The one I bailed out of jail,
the one that roofied me.

03:14.267 --> 03:16.956
Okay, well, yes, but,
technically, that wasn't her.

03:16.958 --> 03:18.891
Trust me,
Karma is awesome.

03:18.893 --> 03:21.571
They all seem awesome until
they come after your money.

03:21.573 --> 03:23.776
That's what I like about Zita.
She's got piles of her own.

03:23.777 --> 03:25.234
I told you.

03:25.236 --> 03:27.966
Okay. You're free to choose
whatever path you wish.

03:27.968 --> 03:29.835
It's just my instinct
to protect you.

03:29.837 --> 03:33.320
No matter what you think,
you're my son.

03:41.592 --> 03:42.971
Is that a new haircut,
Mother?

03:42.973 --> 03:44.431
Why?
Is it too short?

03:44.432 --> 03:46.432
Oh, that darn Becky
at the salon,

03:46.433 --> 03:50.537
so liberal with her scissors...
and other things.

03:50.538 --> 03:51.871
No, it looks nice.

03:51.872 --> 03:54.540
Oh.

03:54.541 --> 03:56.009
Too nice.

03:56.010 --> 03:59.298
I've seen it all before...
the hairdo, the happiness.

03:59.300 --> 04:01.027
- She's cheating.
- You don't know that.

04:01.029 --> 04:02.248
Maybe then
it was from Bruce.

04:02.249 --> 04:03.719
Nope, this is
my mom's pattern.

04:03.721 --> 04:05.876
She cheats on every husband
with the next one.

04:05.878 --> 04:08.149
Every guy is a roll
of the ass[bleep] dice.

04:08.151 --> 04:10.987
Believe it or not, Bruce was
the best in the bunch.

04:10.989 --> 04:13.091
And, uh...

04:13.092 --> 04:16.797
this whole step-sister thing
wasn't so terrible either.

04:16.798 --> 04:18.699
Same.

04:18.700 --> 04:20.262
Right.

04:20.264 --> 04:21.697
So this is our family,

04:21.700 --> 04:23.755
and it's up to us
to keep her from wrecking it.

04:23.757 --> 04:25.820
If we can prove
she started something.

04:25.822 --> 04:27.173
You have a tendency
to fly off the handle

04:27.174 --> 04:28.841
with too little information.

04:28.842 --> 04:29.875
Remember
the croquembouche?

04:31.910 --> 04:34.314
I'm sorry, it's just
a funny word.

04:34.315 --> 04:36.658
Oh, "croquembouche."

04:40.298 --> 04:41.687
Are we being
that couple again?

04:41.688 --> 04:42.873
Sorry, not sorry.

04:42.875 --> 04:44.456
Sorry for real sorry.

04:44.457 --> 04:46.826
I've just been so busy
with appearances,

04:46.827 --> 04:47.940
deal negotiations,
fight prep, and...

04:47.942 --> 04:50.488
When we do get together,
we want to make the most of it.

04:50.490 --> 04:51.804
I get it, really.

04:51.806 --> 04:53.699
I mean, Liam's gonna be here
any second,

04:53.700 --> 04:55.636
and I'm sure we'll be
just as annoying.

04:58.297 --> 04:59.402
Hi.

05:00.440 --> 05:01.942
Hey, what's up, boys?

05:01.943 --> 05:03.942
Liam, good to see you.

05:03.943 --> 05:07.014
Oh, Zita.
Hi.

05:07.015 --> 05:08.526
Hope it's okay to crash
your group hang.

05:08.528 --> 05:09.976
My friends usually
spend Saturdays

05:09.978 --> 05:11.985
doing mandatory
community service.

05:13.102 --> 05:16.288
Karma, hey, love the bag.
Vera Wang, right?

05:16.289 --> 05:19.333
No.
Uh, it's actually H&M.

05:19.335 --> 05:20.794
Oh, cute.

05:20.796 --> 05:23.028
I've actually got to get going.
I've got a flight to catch.

05:23.029 --> 05:24.876
I've got my first
professional MMA fight

05:24.878 --> 05:26.165
tonight in Los Angeles.

05:26.166 --> 05:27.699
- Man, that's awesome.
- Congratulations.

05:27.700 --> 05:28.968
On pay-per-view
and everything.

05:28.969 --> 05:30.836
People are paying
for my boyfriend

05:30.837 --> 05:31.971
and not in a hooker-y way.

05:32.699 --> 05:35.663
I'd say, "Break a leg,"
but, you know, don't.

05:38.479 --> 05:41.982
Sucks his publicist couldn't
get him a plus-one plane ticket.

05:41.984 --> 05:45.285
On the bright side, my boyfriend
has a big, fancy publicist.

05:45.286 --> 05:47.631
It's almost like Duke's
unstoppable since he came out.

05:47.633 --> 05:48.903
Oh, is that how
it happened?

05:48.905 --> 05:50.355
Hey, why don't we all
chip in,

05:50.356 --> 05:51.757
and we can watch
the fight on TV?

05:51.758 --> 05:54.593
Or we could fly to Los Angeles
and watch it for real.

05:54.594 --> 05:57.230
Zita, not everyone can afford
last-minute plane tickets.

05:57.231 --> 05:59.766
Ew, commercial?
No.

05:59.767 --> 06:02.202
I meant we can take
my family jet.

06:10.615 --> 06:12.245
Hey, Veronica Mars,

06:12.246 --> 06:13.980
do you really expect to find
anything in there?

06:13.981 --> 06:16.548
Uh, yeah, okay?
Maybe more clues,

06:16.549 --> 06:18.636
like a receipt
for a fancy perfume

06:18.638 --> 06:21.254
or a-a-a gym membership.

06:21.255 --> 06:24.658
Neither of those are
exactly a smoking gun.

06:26.938 --> 06:28.171
_

06:29.863 --> 06:32.557
Is this smoking enough
for you?

06:32.559 --> 06:34.930
Oh, my God!

06:34.932 --> 06:37.170
Somebody is having
an affair.

06:37.171 --> 06:39.271
Go get the toilet paper,

06:39.272 --> 06:41.530
'cause [bleep] just
got real.

06:44.505 --> 06:46.821
Do all jets come
with a masseur that good?

06:46.823 --> 06:48.016
Another couple minutes,
and I might have been

06:48.018 --> 06:49.012
in the mile high club.

06:51.140 --> 06:52.870
Zita, how can I ever
thank you?

06:52.872 --> 06:54.754
Well, when you and Duke
adopt your first

06:54.755 --> 06:57.758
cute ethnically ambiguous baby,
you can name her after me.

06:57.759 --> 06:59.059
Done.

06:59.060 --> 07:01.561
♪ Ready
for the good life now ♪

07:01.562 --> 07:04.698
♪ Ba-da da-da-da-da-da ♪

07:04.699 --> 07:06.066
We're here!

07:06.067 --> 07:08.135
Okay, Duke's weigh-in
is just about to start.

07:08.136 --> 07:09.184
We'll make it
just in time.

07:09.186 --> 07:10.233
You guys have fun
with that.

07:10.235 --> 07:11.462
Come on, Karma,
let's hit Rodeo

07:11.464 --> 07:12.844
and get something to wear
for the fight tonight.

07:12.846 --> 07:16.176
We can even get something
for the boys too... my treat.

07:16.178 --> 07:17.389
Okay.

07:17.391 --> 07:19.847
Hey, are you okay
with all of this?

07:19.848 --> 07:22.367
You know, with things, um,
back home right now,

07:22.369 --> 07:25.785
I wouldn't blame you
if you felt uncomfortable.

07:25.786 --> 07:27.522
The only thing
that was uncomfortable

07:27.524 --> 07:29.908
was the turbulence
over Arizona.

07:29.910 --> 07:33.795
You're sweet to worry about me,
but I'm having a blast.

07:38.567 --> 07:41.304
What do you mean, you think
the cheater is Bruce?

07:41.306 --> 07:42.970
He has a history
of cheating too.

07:42.971 --> 07:45.288
Just ask any of his
four broken engagements,

07:45.290 --> 07:47.674
and he's been acting
all suspicious lately,

07:47.676 --> 07:48.905
desperate for my affection.

07:48.907 --> 07:51.270
Yeah, it's been like that ever
since your pageant meltdown.

07:51.272 --> 07:52.819
- I'm telling you, it's him.
- Shh, pshh!

07:52.821 --> 07:53.831
What are you two
gabbing about?

07:53.833 --> 07:57.934
Oh, nothing, just homework.
Lauren got a question wrong.

08:00.221 --> 08:01.522
Wha...

08:01.523 --> 08:04.977
Mom, why aren't you wearing
your wedding ring?

08:04.979 --> 08:08.561
Silly, I always take my rings
off before cooking,

08:08.562 --> 08:12.155
ever since the garbage disposal
incident of 2006.

08:12.157 --> 08:14.100
Perfectly reasonable
explanation.

08:14.101 --> 08:17.737
Maybe you wouldn't know
because you never cook anything.

08:17.738 --> 08:21.575
That's a new shirt, Dad.
Expanding your wardrobe lately?

08:21.576 --> 08:24.055
I might have bought a few things
with a very thoughtful gift

08:24.057 --> 08:26.415
a very thoughtful little lady
gave me.

08:26.417 --> 08:28.415
Gift giving?

08:28.416 --> 08:29.993
Making up for something,
Mother?

08:29.995 --> 08:32.451
Honey!

08:32.452 --> 08:35.422
Oh. I know
what this is about.

08:35.423 --> 08:37.758
You're still smarting
from your breakup.

08:37.759 --> 08:40.360
And I'll bet right now you hope
that you will never fall

08:40.361 --> 08:42.897
in love again,
but your soul mate is out there.

08:42.898 --> 08:45.752
You'll find him someday...
or her.

08:45.754 --> 08:47.475
Them.
Whoever.

08:59.413 --> 09:02.620
You, sir, are about to be
very, very famous.

09:02.622 --> 09:04.574
I guess that'll make me
famous adjacent.

09:04.576 --> 09:06.821
Shane, oh, my God!
What are you doing here?

09:06.822 --> 09:08.054
I mean, when?
How?

09:08.056 --> 09:11.486
Zita flew us here in her plane.
She's now my new best friend.

09:11.488 --> 09:14.762
- Hey!
- Wow, the Liam Booker.

09:14.763 --> 09:17.067
That product launch
was a PR triumph.

09:17.069 --> 09:19.332
I've already pre-ordered
my monocle.

09:19.333 --> 09:21.468
Guys, this is
my publicist, Joanna.

09:21.469 --> 09:25.774
Now to the scales,
Duke Lewis, Jr.!

09:25.776 --> 09:27.040
I'll be right back...
I just have to go

09:27.042 --> 09:31.177
intimidate the [bleep]
out of this dude real quick.

09:31.178 --> 09:32.478
Make him cry.

09:32.480 --> 09:35.711
- Yeah!
- All right, Duke!

09:35.713 --> 09:38.078
Whoo-hoo!

09:38.080 --> 09:40.253
171 1/2.

09:42.560 --> 09:43.435
Yeah!

09:43.437 --> 09:46.795
Now, gentlemen, face off.

09:48.996 --> 09:51.298
You don't have to stay
for this part, Shane,

09:51.300 --> 09:52.252
if it makes you jealous.

09:52.254 --> 09:53.908
Not one bit.
Trust me, I know who Duke

09:53.910 --> 09:56.809
is going to prom with,
and it ain't that guy.

09:56.811 --> 09:59.069
Prom?
You're in high school?

09:59.071 --> 10:01.108
People are always so shocked
when I say that.

10:07.249 --> 10:10.082
You look like
a million bucks.

10:10.083 --> 10:13.036
Well, that's because this dress
almost costs that much.

10:13.038 --> 10:14.572
I told you not to look
at the tags.

10:14.574 --> 10:17.023
This trip is on me.

10:17.024 --> 10:18.624
You're sure.

10:18.625 --> 10:21.427
100%. I don't want you to think
about money all weekend.

10:21.429 --> 10:23.675
It sounds like you could use
a break from that.

10:23.677 --> 10:25.932
Uh, can you do me?

10:25.933 --> 10:30.637
Oh, uh, Liam told you
about our money problems?

10:30.638 --> 10:32.404
Yeah.
Skwerkel is boring,

10:32.406 --> 10:34.152
so we just blah, blah, blah
about everything

10:34.154 --> 10:36.877
so we don't
gouge our eyes out.

10:36.878 --> 10:39.123
That's why I thought this trip
would be a good escape,

10:39.125 --> 10:40.947
for you and for Liam.

10:40.948 --> 10:44.685
He had all that
bio-dad drama last week.

10:44.686 --> 10:47.955
Right.
Yeah, that was tough,

10:47.956 --> 10:49.489
tough on Liam.

10:49.490 --> 10:52.881
I can't believe that art douche
was after Liam's money.

10:52.883 --> 10:55.062
What a prick.

10:58.265 --> 11:01.835
Mmm.

11:01.836 --> 11:03.701
One of them is
a really good liar.

11:03.703 --> 11:06.169
Mm-hmm.
Emmy award winning.

11:06.171 --> 11:08.249
I'm gonna head into the office
for a bit, sugar plum.

11:08.251 --> 11:09.536
Uh, this late on a weekend?

11:09.538 --> 11:12.680
Yeah, it's less distractions.
Have a good night.

11:12.681 --> 11:14.831
Okay, We're following
his ass right now.

11:14.833 --> 11:16.932
20 bucks says he leads us
straight to his floozy.

11:16.934 --> 11:19.977
Sorry, girls.
The station called.

11:19.979 --> 11:21.971
There's a chance
of wind sheer tonight,

11:21.973 --> 11:24.180
and they want me there,
just in case.

11:24.182 --> 11:25.359
Don't wait up.

11:25.360 --> 11:26.826
Uh-huh, uh-huh!

11:26.827 --> 11:29.930
There's no such thing
as wind sheer... I think.

11:29.931 --> 11:31.609
Well, [bleep], it could still
be either of them.

11:31.611 --> 11:34.818
Who do we follow?

11:34.820 --> 11:37.604
Neither.
We're gonna go to that motel.

11:37.605 --> 11:39.851
It's time for a stakeout.

11:52.855 --> 11:55.690
Neither car is here.

11:55.692 --> 11:57.557
We must have beat
the cheater.

11:57.558 --> 11:59.194
Or we missed the cheater
altogether

11:59.195 --> 12:01.528
because you had to stop
for snacks.

12:01.529 --> 12:03.662
Have you not seen
any stakeout movies?

12:03.664 --> 12:07.002
Snacks are essential.
We might be here awhile.

12:13.042 --> 12:15.576
Jeez, it's like you're the one
about to get in the ring.

12:15.577 --> 12:17.110
Well, Duke's wanted this
since preschool.

12:17.111 --> 12:19.247
He has to win tonight in order
to be taken seriously.

12:19.248 --> 12:21.662
Plus, watching my boyfriend
get beat to a bloody pulp

12:21.664 --> 12:23.350
is not my idea
of foreplay...

12:23.351 --> 12:24.459
I don't think.

12:24.461 --> 12:28.523
Shane,
Duke is gonna slay it.

12:28.524 --> 12:30.926
I hope so.

12:30.927 --> 12:34.062
Okay, I'm gonna do some laps
to work off these nerves.

12:36.565 --> 12:37.523
Hey, Zita.

12:37.525 --> 12:40.769
Hi.
We're here.

12:46.433 --> 12:49.935
You might want to scoop that jaw
up off the floor, Booker.

12:52.815 --> 12:53.925
There are a million words

12:53.927 --> 12:55.883
running through my mind
right now.

12:55.884 --> 12:58.229
I'll just go with "wowza."

12:58.231 --> 13:00.454
Thanks.

13:00.455 --> 13:03.948
And you don't look
so bad yourself.

13:03.950 --> 13:05.893
Um...

13:05.894 --> 13:07.628
can I talk to you
for a second?

13:07.629 --> 13:08.129
Yeah.

13:08.131 --> 13:09.536
Zita Cruz.

13:09.538 --> 13:10.538
- Oh.
- My apologies.

13:10.540 --> 13:12.392
I had no idea
you were coming.

13:12.394 --> 13:14.131
We'll get you on the list
right away.

13:14.133 --> 13:15.217
- Okay.
- Liam, you dog.

13:15.219 --> 13:17.305
Why didn't you tell me
you two were dating?

13:17.306 --> 13:19.271
- Uh, because we're...
- Let's get you guys

13:19.273 --> 13:21.248
over to the red carpet
right away.

13:21.250 --> 13:23.312
Okay.

13:25.589 --> 13:28.273
Sorry, sweetie.
Do you mind waiting to the side?

13:28.275 --> 13:29.741
But I-I'm...

13:39.662 --> 13:42.100
Hey, did you see
where Karma went?

13:42.102 --> 13:45.868
Uh, no, I thought she was
behind you.

13:49.538 --> 13:51.024
Karma?

13:51.026 --> 13:52.387
Shane!

13:52.389 --> 13:54.918
- Can we offline for a sec?
- Yes.

13:54.920 --> 13:57.789
I just want to make sure we're
both on the same page, you know,

13:57.791 --> 13:59.147
that you're on board
with the plan.

13:59.148 --> 14:01.933
Uh, unless the plan
is looking dangerously fly,

14:01.935 --> 14:03.017
I don't know what
you're talking about.

14:04.352 --> 14:05.964
You said you're proud
of our Duke's

14:05.966 --> 14:07.419
- rising star, right?
- Yeah.

14:07.421 --> 14:08.502
So you wouldn't want
to do anything

14:08.504 --> 14:09.923
to spoil that,
now, would you?

14:09.924 --> 14:11.427
You really like to talk
all around a thing

14:11.429 --> 14:13.460
before saying it, huh?

14:13.461 --> 14:15.095
Look...

14:15.096 --> 14:17.644
I tell most of my clients
not to have a relationship

14:17.646 --> 14:19.784
in the open,
and if they do,

14:19.786 --> 14:21.369
it should be
with someone impressive,

14:21.370 --> 14:24.229
usually one of my other clients,
no offense.

14:24.231 --> 14:27.407
Yes, offense.
Very much offense.

14:27.408 --> 14:28.734
I'm not impressive enough?

14:28.736 --> 14:31.680
You're in high school.
It's bad optics.

14:31.681 --> 14:34.031
Makes Duke seem...

14:34.033 --> 14:35.649
less desirable.

14:35.650 --> 14:37.689
It's better for Duke
if you keep your relationship

14:37.691 --> 14:39.091
on the down-low.

14:39.093 --> 14:41.656
- You understand.
- I certainly do not.

14:41.657 --> 14:43.657
And Duke won't either.

14:43.658 --> 14:46.192
Well, Duke and I
have already discussed it.

14:46.193 --> 14:47.790
But don't worry.

14:47.792 --> 14:49.297
I've already arranged
for you to watch the fight

14:49.298 --> 14:50.808
in the green room,
if you'd like.

14:50.810 --> 14:53.635
Sorry, one sec. Go for Jo.

15:04.113 --> 15:06.681
This sucks.

15:06.682 --> 15:08.749
Marriage sucks.

15:08.750 --> 15:10.373
Correction,
love sucks.

15:10.375 --> 15:12.253
You don't believe that.

15:12.254 --> 15:14.055
Yeah, I do.

15:14.056 --> 15:16.645
Wake up,
soon-to-be-former sister.

15:16.647 --> 15:20.255
These are our role models for
happy, lasting relationships.

15:20.257 --> 15:21.898
You and I are doomed.

15:21.900 --> 15:23.819
_

15:24.732 --> 15:26.567
Maybe not.

15:26.568 --> 15:29.870
"Doomed" is such a strong
and negative word.

15:29.871 --> 15:31.912
We are not our parents.

15:31.914 --> 15:33.407
Wait, wait.
Here we go, here we go.

15:33.408 --> 15:34.910
Whose car is it?

15:42.049 --> 15:45.203
I was right.
It was my mom.

15:57.799 --> 16:00.936
That bitch!

16:06.441 --> 16:07.709
Hey, there you are.

16:07.710 --> 16:09.499
I've been looking everywhere
for you.

16:09.501 --> 16:14.349
Uh, it turns out the dress
doesn't fit.

16:14.350 --> 16:16.484
None of this does.

16:16.485 --> 16:20.555
Uh, could you have your jet
take me home tonight?

16:20.556 --> 16:23.826
I mean, that's okay, right?
You said money doesn't matter.

16:23.828 --> 16:26.473
Yeah.
Yeah, whatever you want.

16:26.475 --> 16:27.894
Well,
let me go with you.

16:27.895 --> 16:31.965
No.
You belong here.

16:31.966 --> 16:34.470
In fact, you two
belong together.

16:34.472 --> 16:37.738
I mean, everyone else
already thinks so.

16:37.739 --> 16:41.009
I'm just gonna...

16:42.445 --> 16:44.726
I knew the money was
gonna be a problem.

16:44.728 --> 16:46.760
It always screws
everything up.

16:46.762 --> 16:50.185
It's not just the money.

16:50.186 --> 16:52.509
I had to find out from Zita
that you thought

16:52.511 --> 16:55.976
you found your real dad?

16:55.978 --> 16:58.027
Liam, I'm so sorry
that happened,

16:58.029 --> 17:00.673
but why didn't you
share that with me?

17:00.675 --> 17:02.225
'Cause you were with Amy
all last week.

17:02.227 --> 17:05.051
Watching TV.
You could've called.

17:05.054 --> 17:07.854
Look, I don't know what I can
and can't do with you.

17:07.856 --> 17:09.692
How am I supposed to know
what the rules are

17:09.694 --> 17:11.739
if I don't even know
what we are?

17:11.740 --> 17:14.792
I mean, do you... We're more
than friends with benefits,

17:14.795 --> 17:15.820
but we're not quite
back together,

17:15.823 --> 17:18.679
and, oh, yeah, also,
you've been tying me up.

17:18.680 --> 17:20.839
So you tell me, Karma,
what's the answer?

17:20.840 --> 17:23.359
I haven't had any answers since
you slept with my best friend.

17:23.362 --> 17:26.220
There it is,
your trump card!

17:26.221 --> 17:28.855
How many times do I have
to tell you that I'm sorry,

17:28.856 --> 17:30.990
that I want to be
with you?

17:30.991 --> 17:32.826
Will that ever be enough?

17:32.827 --> 17:36.251
I don't know!

17:36.253 --> 17:37.866
I don't know.

17:41.034 --> 17:43.071
I have to go.

17:55.922 --> 17:57.376
Excuse me, can you direct me
to the green room,

17:57.378 --> 17:59.463
since that's where I'm supposed
to be locked away and hidden?

17:59.464 --> 18:00.642
Shane, what are you
talking about?

18:00.644 --> 18:01.898
I talked to Joanna.

18:01.899 --> 18:03.567
After everything
we've been through,

18:03.568 --> 18:05.669
how did you think I'd be okay
going back in the closet,

18:05.670 --> 18:08.137
to be your secret little
boy toy on the side

18:08.138 --> 18:08.960
when the cameras are off?

18:08.962 --> 18:10.868
- Shane, stop.
- You stop.

18:10.870 --> 18:13.350
Stop letting the publicist,
the paparazzi,

18:13.352 --> 18:14.907
the pay-per-view
go to your head.

18:14.909 --> 18:16.261
God, if I'd known it was
gonna be like this,

18:16.263 --> 18:18.916
I never would've outed you.

18:18.917 --> 18:21.061
Ladies and gentlemen,

18:21.063 --> 18:24.608
please welcome to the ring
for the very first time

18:24.610 --> 18:27.290
Duke Lewis, Jr.

18:31.428 --> 18:33.397
Just so you know,

18:33.398 --> 18:36.527
when Joanna asked me
to keep you a secret,

18:36.529 --> 18:38.537
I said no.

19:04.230 --> 19:07.968
Hello, Karma.
Please, get in.

19:13.820 --> 19:14.889
Maybe we should just go home.

19:14.891 --> 19:16.133
You'll say something
you'll regret.

19:16.135 --> 19:17.472
I'll say something
she'll regret.

19:17.474 --> 19:19.842
We moved here for her,
uprooted our lives,

19:19.843 --> 19:21.947
let a whole new family
into our hearts!

19:21.949 --> 19:23.647
Farrah!
Open up!

19:23.648 --> 19:26.335
We know you're in there
doing the devil's dead

19:26.337 --> 19:28.551
in your pit of sin!

19:28.552 --> 19:30.442
Maybe it wasn't my mom
after all.

19:30.444 --> 19:35.541
Either you open this door,
or I drive my car through it!

19:37.794 --> 19:39.633
Hey, baby.

19:39.635 --> 19:42.900
Dad?

19:46.615 --> 19:47.884
Hey.

19:49.107 --> 19:50.607
You missed the whole fight.

19:50.608 --> 19:53.693
Yeah, I didn't really
feel like watching.

19:53.695 --> 19:55.477
Are you okay?

19:55.478 --> 19:56.847
That convo with Karma

19:56.848 --> 20:00.516
looked like it was going
in a dark direction.

20:00.517 --> 20:02.519
Did you two break up?

20:02.520 --> 20:07.090
I don't know if there's
anything to break up.

20:07.091 --> 20:10.895
Well, what do you want?

20:10.896 --> 20:13.996
Honestly?

20:13.997 --> 20:15.499
I don't know.

20:18.886 --> 20:21.338
Well...

20:21.339 --> 20:22.365
I know what I want.

Welcome to detention.

20:34.970 --> 20:38.832
For the next seven hours,
you belong to me.

20:38.833 --> 20:40.216
Aren't you guys all friends?

20:41.110 --> 20:42.604
I don't give a [bleep]
what you think.

20:42.606 --> 20:44.286
You're guilty
of yet another lie.

20:44.288 --> 20:45.629
