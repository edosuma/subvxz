00:08.594 --> 00:10.295
If you keep making decisions

00:10.329 --> 00:11.596
the way you've been making decisions,

00:11.630 --> 00:14.265
you're gonna ruin every good
thing that comes your way.

00:25.609 --> 00:28.445
- I love you, Brandon.
- I never realized until today

01:03.297 --> 01:05.248
Good. Excited.

01:05.282 --> 01:06.583
- Yeah.
- Scared?

01:06.617 --> 01:08.384
No.

A little.

[laughter]

01:12.556 --> 01:15.458
Be sure to tell Jesus I say hi.

01:15.493 --> 01:18.628
Oh, really, Gabi, why don't we talk about

01:18.662 --> 01:20.497
what scares us all about going home.

01:20.531 --> 01:22.499
Anybody?

01:22.533 --> 01:24.634
- Temptations.
- Yeah.

01:24.668 --> 01:27.303
Like Brandon. How's that gonna work?

01:27.338 --> 01:28.638
Yeah, how is that gonna work, Callie?

01:28.672 --> 01:30.707
Have you had any time
to think that through?

01:30.741 --> 01:34.410
I mean, he's gonna be my brother.

01:34.445 --> 01:36.513
Once Jude and I are adopted. So...

01:36.547 --> 01:38.481
[Gabi] You're gonna be
sleeping under the same roof,

01:38.516 --> 01:40.517
he's right next door.

01:40.551 --> 01:42.485
You're not gonna be like laying awake

01:42.520 --> 01:45.288
thinking you could just
sneak into his bedroom?

01:45.322 --> 01:47.390
- [Rita] Ok, Gabi, enough.
- Come on.

01:47.424 --> 01:49.325
Are you like, really over him?

01:49.360 --> 01:51.294
I know what I want.

01:51.328 --> 01:53.296
I mean, it's great that you're leaving here

01:53.330 --> 01:55.498
knowing what you want,
it really is a good start.

01:55.533 --> 01:57.667
But it's easy to get confused.

01:57.701 --> 01:59.469
You're not going to have group twice a day.

01:59.503 --> 02:01.304
You're not going to be confronted

by any of these lovely young ladies,

02:03.507 --> 02:05.375
trying to get you to
talk about how you feel.

02:05.409 --> 02:07.243
You gotta hold yourself accountable.

02:07.278 --> 02:08.411
Mm, that's right.

02:08.445 --> 02:09.645
Least you got people.

02:09.680 --> 02:12.348
- You're lucky.
- [Cole] Yeah.

02:12.383 --> 02:14.450
[Rita] The mistake most
girls make when they go home

02:14.485 --> 02:17.487
is they underestimate just how tough
it's gonna be out there in the real world.

02:17.521 --> 02:19.522
So don't be cocky.

02:19.557 --> 02:22.692
And that goes for you too, Daph. Right?

02:22.726 --> 02:24.157
Why don't we go around now

02:24.158 --> 02:26.460
and everybody can tell Callie
what it is they learned from her.

02:26.497 --> 02:28.381
Ok, well,

02:28.415 --> 02:32.735
Callie, I learned from
you to shut up and listen.

02:32.770 --> 02:35.638
- [Rita] Gab?
- And to not to interrupt.

02:35.673 --> 02:37.774
- Ok, well, you know, it's still a work in progress.
- Yeah.

02:37.776 --> 02:41.711
I learned we've all got addictions.

02:41.745 --> 02:44.681
And, I could trust you.

02:44.715 --> 02:45.682
[Rita] Carmen?

02:47.618 --> 02:50.386
I, um, learned to not judge

02:50.421 --> 02:53.389
just on, you know, looks.

02:53.424 --> 02:55.758
She looked like she didn't belong here...

02:55.793 --> 02:57.594
but she did.

02:57.628 --> 03:01.397
- I didn't really learn anything from you.
- [laughter]

03:01.432 --> 03:04.267
Except I learned how to look
like all blank and superior.

03:04.301 --> 03:05.535
- That's harsh.
- [Carmen] Come on.

03:05.569 --> 03:09.472
No, that's like a really good skill

03:09.506 --> 03:11.474
to have in certain situations.

03:11.508 --> 03:14.410
Mm. Yeah, that was a nice save.

03:14.445 --> 03:16.346
Really, good. Cole.

03:16.380 --> 03:17.680
You're up.

03:17.715 --> 03:19.682
I learned...

03:21.552 --> 03:22.719
that you're my friend.

03:24.688 --> 03:27.657
And I learned about forgiveness.

03:29.693 --> 03:34.364
Callie, why don't you share with
the girls what you learned from them.

03:35.432 --> 03:37.300
Um, yeah.

03:38.535 --> 03:41.537
Well, you all, um...

03:41.572 --> 03:44.741
taught me what courage is.

03:46.410 --> 03:48.277
Every one of you,

03:48.312 --> 03:52.298
you're so brave and awesome.

Even you Becka.

03:55.352 --> 03:56.686
[laughter]

03:56.720 --> 03:59.322
And Rita. Um...

04:00.491 --> 04:04.227
you taught me that compassion

04:04.261 --> 04:05.428
is given for free...

04:05.462 --> 04:07.296
but...

04:08.565 --> 04:10.700
respect has to be earned.

04:13.303 --> 04:14.470
I really respect you.

04:14.505 --> 04:16.305
Thank you, Callie.

04:18.475 --> 04:20.375
I really respect you, too.

04:47.721 --> 04:49.338
Welcome back.

04:52.342 --> 04:55.511
I have to, uh, finish my book report.

04:57.748 --> 05:01.384
- It's due tomorrow.
- Sweetheart, can't you finish that after dinner?

05:03.287 --> 05:06.355
Oh, it's ok. We'll catch up later, right?

05:09.359 --> 05:11.360
Jesus wanted to be here,
but he had practice.

05:11.395 --> 05:12.562
[Callie] It's cool.

05:12.596 --> 05:15.231
So let's go set the table.

05:15.265 --> 05:16.566
Ok, I'll take this for you.

05:16.600 --> 05:18.367
Thank you. Thank you.

05:22.306 --> 05:23.473
I'm really glad you're back.

05:23.507 --> 05:26.375

this is just something
I needed to do, for me.

05:35.519 --> 05:37.253
Ok, it's not your fault or anything.

05:37.287 --> 05:38.721
What's not my fault?

05:38.756 --> 05:40.490

uh...

our... moms,

05:45.295 --> 05:47.530

didn't want to affect your decision.

11:10.111 --> 11:11.945
Whoa! Uh, jeez.

11:11.979 --> 11:14.080
[chuckles] Hey. Hi.

11:15.917 --> 11:19.886
Sorry. I'm Dani. I'm a,
friend, of your dad's.

11:19.921 --> 11:23.723
Oh, uh, it's cool. I just didn't...

11:23.758 --> 11:24.925
Yeah, I meant to get up and out.

11:24.959 --> 11:27.861
So it wouldn't be awkward.

11:27.895 --> 11:30.030
Too late. [chuckles]

11:30.064 --> 11:32.165
- Yeah, exactly.
- Yeah.

11:33.901 --> 11:36.102
Nice jacket.

11:36.137 --> 11:38.688
Except for your collar is crooked.

11:38.723 --> 11:39.940
Oh.

11:39.974 --> 11:42.042
Men just aren't good
at dressing themselves.

11:42.076 --> 11:44.945
- [chuckles]
- [approaching footsteps]

11:44.979 --> 11:46.846
- Hey.
- I overslept!

11:46.864 --> 11:50.817
It's ok. Hey, uh, I see
you met Hurricane Dani.

11:50.851 --> 11:53.703
Shut up! All right, I'm
gonna go get dressed.

11:53.738 --> 11:55.739
I'm gonna be late and
Pilates is my religion.

11:55.790 --> 11:57.757
Gotta keep everything high and tight.

11:57.825 --> 11:59.893
Don't be late for school!

12:01.863 --> 12:03.096
[sighs]

12:05.733 --> 12:06.933
- You have a girlfriend?
- [exhales deeply]

12:06.968 --> 12:08.668
She's my sober buddy.

12:08.703 --> 12:10.937
Well, do you sleep with
all your sober buddies?

12:10.972 --> 12:13.073
Excuse me?

12:13.107 --> 12:15.809
I'm sorry, I thought that you
weren't supposed to be getting into

12:15.843 --> 12:18.879
any kind of relationships
when you're getting sober?

12:18.913 --> 12:20.947
It's not a relationship.

12:20.982 --> 12:24.017
I'm not drinking. That's
the most important thing. Ok?

12:24.051 --> 12:27.737
Now get moving. You're not
gonna be late on my watch.

12:27.772 --> 12:30.824
Oh, uh, for lessons this week.

12:32.093 --> 12:35.896
Um... I was actually thinking
maybe I could, you know,

12:35.930 --> 12:38.999
take a break from piano.

12:39.033 --> 12:41.134
What do you mean? You love piano.

12:41.168 --> 12:43.737
You worked your ass off to
get this teacher to take you.

12:43.771 --> 12:46.840
Yeah, I know, I'm just a little burned out.

12:46.874 --> 12:48.942
Should I be worried?

12:48.976 --> 12:49.943
No.

12:49.977 --> 12:51.077
Is this about Callie?

12:51.112 --> 12:54.748
No, Dad, I'm ok. I...

12:54.782 --> 12:57.784
Thank you for paying for the lessons but...

12:59.120 --> 13:01.855
it's not forever. Ok?

13:01.923 --> 13:04.024
Ok.

13:04.058 --> 13:06.726
- All right. Yep. See you.
- All right, I'll see you later.

13:06.761 --> 13:09.696
[bell rings]

13:09.730 --> 13:11.815
[indistinct chatter]

13:13.734 --> 13:15.068
[Callie] Ignore them.

13:15.102 --> 13:20.040
I have no intentions of
acknowledging her miserable existence,

13:20.041 --> 13:22.660
or her questionnable taste in leggings.

13:22.661 --> 13:25.685
Look, I just, what if she's telling
Chase terrible things about me?

13:27.148 --> 13:30.050
You know that feeling in
the pit of your stomach?

13:30.084 --> 13:32.819
That is what it feels like to be notorious.

13:34.955 --> 13:36.089
[sighs]

13:36.123 --> 13:37.807
Hey, welcome back.

13:37.842 --> 13:39.793
Aw, you noticed I was gone?

13:39.827 --> 13:42.696
So, cast party tonight. We still on?

13:42.730 --> 13:44.681
Oh, uh, I don't know.

13:44.732 --> 13:47.767
I'm mean, Kelsey's gonna be there

13:47.802 --> 13:49.736
and I think I'll just feel weird or...

13:49.770 --> 13:52.806
I couldn't care less about the cast party.

13:52.840 --> 13:55.742
Maybe we could, go see
a movie or something?

13:55.776 --> 13:58.645
Yeah. Sure. That sounds good.

13:58.679 --> 14:00.747
Sweet! I'll see you at lunch?

14:22.169 --> 14:23.970
Hey.

14:24.004 --> 14:25.005
Hey.

14:25.039 --> 14:26.740
How are you?

14:27.692 --> 14:28.675
I'm, great.

14:28.693 --> 14:31.011
Oh. Good.

14:33.047 --> 14:34.898
What about you? How's your dad's?

14:34.949 --> 14:36.883
Oh, um...

14:37.868 --> 14:39.152
You know, it's...

14:42.073 --> 14:43.073
I gotta...

14:43.124 --> 14:44.791
Yeah.

14:44.825 --> 14:45.859
See ya.

14:46.877 --> 14:48.028
Ok.

14:59.974 --> 15:04.678
Hey, uh, Professor Marshall, this
is Mike Foster, Brandon's dad.

15:04.712 --> 15:09.766
Uh, today, he told me that he wanted
to take a break from his lessons.

15:09.817 --> 15:11.951
And I'm not sure I should let him.

15:11.986 --> 15:13.987
Um, I'd like to discuss that with you,

15:14.021 --> 15:15.989
if you can call me back
that would be great.

15:16.023 --> 15:17.857
Uh, thanks.

15:24.167 --> 15:27.152
<i>♪ It kills me slow ♪</i>

15:27.186 --> 15:30.088
- Sorry man.
- What the hell, man?

15:30.122 --> 15:32.758
Faulty boomerang. Maybe
I'm not throwing it right.

15:32.792 --> 15:34.009
Mind throwing it somewhere else?

15:39.148 --> 15:40.198
[Vico] Want a hit?

15:40.233 --> 15:42.033
No, thanks.

15:44.153 --> 15:46.071
How does that work?

15:46.105 --> 15:48.807
Ditching class when your
mom's the vice principal?

15:50.209 --> 15:53.011
- Don't know.
- You're not gonna narc on me, are ya?

15:53.045 --> 15:54.212
No.

15:56.783 --> 15:59.985
That Callie girl, she's
your foster sister, right?

16:00.019 --> 16:04.689
Did she really run away with
the mop head? You know, Wyatt.

16:04.724 --> 16:06.758
Yeah, I know. She didn't run away with him.

16:06.793 --> 16:09.010
Hey, I don't know why
everyone keeps saying that.

16:11.180 --> 16:15.934
Look, I'm buying the
booze for a party tonight.

16:15.968 --> 16:17.035
You should come check it out.

16:17.103 --> 16:20.038
Sounds like you need
to blow off some steam.

16:20.072 --> 16:22.007
You're buying the booze?

16:30.116 --> 16:31.183
Twenty-three?

16:31.217 --> 16:35.987
I look young for my age.
Good genes. [chuckles]

16:36.022 --> 16:37.789
Where'd you get this?

16:37.824 --> 16:39.758
A buddy of mine uses his school ID maker.

16:39.792 --> 16:42.894
And it really works? You
don't get busted or anything?

16:42.929 --> 16:47.032
I use it at liquor stores,
bars, never had a problem.

16:47.066 --> 16:49.201
If you want one, I could hook you up?

16:54.941 --> 16:56.925
I had to say it. It was so cool.

16:56.976 --> 16:59.878
- Is one of you, Jude?
- Uh, he is.

16:59.912 --> 17:01.713
Then these are for you.

17:01.747 --> 17:03.932
- [Jude] Thank you.
- Enjoy!

17:03.983 --> 17:05.784
What was that?

17:05.818 --> 17:06.984
I don't know.

17:08.154 --> 17:11.723
Well, actually, tomorrow
is kinda my birthday.

17:11.757 --> 17:13.909
How does the cupcake
delivery girl know before me?

17:13.943 --> 17:15.727
I don't think that's her actual job.

17:17.762 --> 17:19.980
My mom gave birth to me at home and

17:19.981 --> 17:21.571
when she went to file the paperwork,

17:21.968 --> 17:24.118
they messed up the date by a couple weeks.

17:24.170 --> 17:26.972
So when Callie and I went
into the foster system,

17:27.006 --> 17:30.959
we never told anyone my real birth date.

17:31.010 --> 17:34.045
We kept it a secret, you know, just for us.

17:34.181 --> 17:35.696
- So can we eat them?
- Hold on.

17:35.697 --> 17:38.900
She must be trying to send me
some type of message or something.

17:38.901 --> 17:39.618
[Connor] What does it mean?

17:40.049 --> 17:41.116
[Jude] I have no idea.

17:42.150 --> 17:42.930
Here.

17:46.122 --> 17:47.322
Now, can we eat 'em?

17:54.463 --> 17:56.548
- Hey.
- Hey.

17:58.334 --> 18:01.419
So, how's it going at your dad's?

18:01.453 --> 18:05.290
Ok. Um, he has a girlfriend.

18:05.324 --> 18:06.658
Wait, really?

18:06.692 --> 18:08.476
It's kinda weird.

18:08.511 --> 18:12.264
Well, I mean, he's not working
and he's under investigation,

18:12.298 --> 18:14.299
I guess he kind of deserves a girlfriend.

18:16.435 --> 18:18.353
What's going on with the
D.A. and all that, anyway?

18:18.404 --> 18:20.405
I mean, is everything ok?

18:20.439 --> 18:22.240
Yeah, seems like it.

18:22.275 --> 18:25.243
Um, you know, he says they have nothing,

18:25.278 --> 18:27.512
except for Ana's testimony.

18:27.546 --> 18:30.648
So it should blow over.

18:32.718 --> 18:35.353
You know, if it wasn't for me,

18:35.388 --> 18:36.588
Mom would've never gotten shot

18:36.622 --> 18:39.357
and your dad wouldn't be
going through all this.

18:39.392 --> 18:40.592
I just...

18:42.361 --> 18:44.562
I wish there was something I could do.

18:47.667 --> 18:49.367
Maybe if I talked to her...

18:49.402 --> 18:53.471
No, don't even think about
it. No way. Stay away from her.

18:55.408 --> 18:57.392
Yeah, you're right.

18:57.443 --> 19:00.278
She'd probably just ask me for more money.

19:24.470 --> 19:25.470
Whoa. Hey.

19:25.504 --> 19:27.372
Hey. What are you doing home?

19:27.406 --> 19:30.475
Um, I'm... I needed something from my room.

19:30.509 --> 19:34.379
- Ok.
- What about you?

19:34.413 --> 19:36.348
I, um...

19:36.382 --> 19:38.550
I'm being questioned by
the D.A. this afternoon.

19:38.584 --> 19:41.653
And the lawyer told me to come as a person,

19:41.687 --> 19:44.389
not a cop, no uniform.

19:44.423 --> 19:45.523
This is going away right?

19:45.558 --> 19:46.658
I mean, Dad said they have no case.

19:46.777 --> 19:51.448
Yeah. Yeah, it's just politics, you know?

19:51.482 --> 19:53.483
Nothing to worry about.

19:54.652 --> 19:56.619
- Ok.
- Ok.

19:59.673 --> 20:01.458
Good to see you.

20:02.659 --> 20:05.328
Did you find any more clues at school?

20:05.362 --> 20:07.764
I don't think so. I looked all over.

20:08.699 --> 20:10.433
Here's one.

20:11.852 --> 20:15.388
It says 'anxiety'. That's what I'm
getting looking for these clues.

20:17.841 --> 20:19.776
I don't see any more ducks.

20:19.810 --> 20:22.395
- Look for candy!
- Ok.

20:24.732 --> 20:25.732
Oh, I got one.

20:25.783 --> 20:27.617
Up here!

20:29.787 --> 20:31.521
I don't see any more.

20:31.539 --> 20:32.822
Oh, here's one.

20:38.529 --> 20:42.465
Hmm. "And... all... anxiety... "

20:42.500 --> 20:45.668
they... was... perfect"?

20:45.703 --> 20:47.637
How about...

20:48.806 --> 20:52.408
"Perfect... anxiety... "

20:52.443 --> 20:54.444
they all...

20:55.813 --> 20:57.714
and was.

20:59.517 --> 21:01.384
I don't think that's it.

21:08.359 --> 21:09.759
Hey, Chase.

21:11.462 --> 21:13.763
Um, I just wanted to apologize

21:13.797 --> 21:16.432
for the whole stolen fedora thing.

21:16.467 --> 21:18.434
I don't want you to think
I'm that kind of person.

21:18.469 --> 21:21.804
Kelsey actually took it, but I should
have made her take it back to the store.

21:21.899 --> 21:24.634
But you loved it so much
and now I'm babbling so...

21:24.668 --> 21:27.837
It's fine. No harm done.

21:27.871 --> 21:30.873
I just miss you working on the play.

21:30.908 --> 21:33.610
I missed that smile, too.

21:33.644 --> 21:36.546
You gonna come to the cast party tonight?

21:36.580 --> 21:38.448
Yeah, totally. I wouldn't miss it.

21:38.482 --> 21:39.815
Sweet, see you there.

21:45.656 --> 21:47.790
[woman] Do you solemnly state
that the testimony you will give

21:47.824 --> 21:50.593
in this deposition proceeding
is the truth, the whole truth,

21:50.628 --> 21:52.845
- and nothing but the truth?
- I do.

21:52.880 --> 21:55.431
[man] Please state your name, rank
and position in the police department.

21:55.466 --> 21:58.551
My name is Stefanie Foster.
I am a corporal with...

21:58.602 --> 22:01.521
[man] At which point, you
were in the second bedroom

22:01.555 --> 22:03.473
by yourself, is that correct?

22:03.507 --> 22:05.375
Where was your partner at the time?

22:06.577 --> 22:07.810
He was clearing the kitchen.

22:09.580 --> 22:11.781
And it was at this moment you were shot,

22:11.815 --> 22:16.552
fell to the ground, unconscious, correct?

22:18.889 --> 22:21.758
No.

22:21.792 --> 22:24.560
- I'm sorry?
- No, I was not unconscious.

22:24.595 --> 22:28.381
I have here your statement to Internal
Affairs, and you clearly state...

22:28.415 --> 22:30.700
I lied. I was awake. I saw the whole thing.

22:33.437 --> 22:36.806
After firing on me, the shooter
dropped his gun and it misfired.

22:36.840 --> 22:40.410
He did not have his hands up in
surrender when Officer Foster entered

22:40.444 --> 22:43.880
and fired on him, as we were trained to do.

22:43.914 --> 22:48.484
I see. And how do I know
you're not lying now?

22:48.519 --> 22:50.620
Because I'm under oath.

22:52.456 --> 22:56.592
And because by telling you this,
I could very well lose my job.

23:01.398 --> 23:03.666
I was surprised to hear from you.

23:03.701 --> 23:06.736
Thanks for meeting me on such sort notice.

23:08.472 --> 23:12.575
Is this about Jesus and
Mariana? Are they ok?

23:13.644 --> 23:15.478
They are.

23:15.512 --> 23:18.514
I mean, they're pretty upset
about our mom getting shot.

23:18.549 --> 23:21.384
Of course, I'm sure.

23:22.586 --> 23:24.487
Can you just tell them that I'm sorry?

23:24.521 --> 23:26.522
If you're sorry then why are you lying?

23:27.591 --> 23:28.691
Lying? About...

23:28.726 --> 23:31.494
Being at the house when
my dad shot your boyfriend.

23:31.528 --> 23:35.398
- I was.
- With Jesus. At the Women's Shelter.

23:36.900 --> 23:38.735
You wouldn't have gone to meet him,

23:38.769 --> 23:43.473
knowing that our mom could be dying.

23:43.507 --> 23:44.841
Just to get money from him.

23:44.875 --> 23:47.777
You wouldn't do that.

23:47.811 --> 23:49.679
Right? Because I mean...

23:50.647 --> 23:51.881
they would hate you.

23:55.619 --> 23:57.420
I mean, right?

23:58.455 --> 24:01.424
Right. I wouldn't do that.

24:01.458 --> 24:02.825
Because, you care about them.

24:02.860 --> 24:06.829
I do. I love them.

24:06.864 --> 24:08.598
And you want to maybe

24:08.632 --> 24:10.767
someday be a part of their lives.

24:12.736 --> 24:15.671
So you gotta tell the D.A. the truth.

24:16.740 --> 24:18.508
That you weren't there.

24:18.542 --> 24:20.543
Because if you were there...

24:20.577 --> 24:21.778
[chuckles]

24:23.480 --> 24:25.581
they would never forgive you.

24:30.454 --> 24:32.822
I want to tell the truth.

24:33.857 --> 24:35.558
It's just...

24:37.861 --> 24:39.662
they really want me to testify

24:39.696 --> 24:42.799
and I don't... I'm scared that
they're gonna cut off my food stamps...

24:42.833 --> 24:44.500
Maybe I can help you.

24:55.512 --> 24:57.346
That's a lot of money.

24:58.699 --> 25:02.418
I just want you to feel safe,

25:02.452 --> 25:03.719
you know, to do what's right.

25:16.120 --> 25:19.189
The last time you went to a
party, Mariana, you got drunk.

25:19.223 --> 25:22.292
And I also got grounded
and learned my lesson.

25:22.326 --> 25:25.312
Besides, it's the cast party, there's
not gonna be any alcohol there.

25:28.149 --> 25:30.133
Ok, what if Callie goes with me?

25:30.168 --> 25:32.402
She didn't drink last time. She can
be like my chaperone or something.

25:32.437 --> 25:36.139
Yeah, um, I don't think I
want that responsibility.

25:36.157 --> 25:38.191
You know, I'm on probation, remember?

25:38.242 --> 25:41.244
Yeah, I agree. It's not Callie's
job to babysit you, honey.

25:41.279 --> 25:44.147
Ok, well, you can like
drive us off and pick us up.

25:44.182 --> 25:46.049
We can even take a
Breathalyzer test if you want.

25:46.083 --> 25:48.285
- Mariana...
- How are you gonna know if you can ever trust us

25:48.319 --> 25:51.154
if you don't give us the
chance to prove ourselves?

25:51.189 --> 25:54.057
I mean, you want Callie to
make friends and get involved.

25:54.091 --> 25:57.093
How is she going to do that
if she's locked up at home?

25:59.197 --> 26:01.965
All right, I will discuss it
with mom when she gets home.

26:11.309 --> 26:12.976
I found 11 clues. Are there more?

26:13.010 --> 26:14.377
I don't know what you're talking about.

26:14.412 --> 26:16.179
At least tell me if there are 13.

26:16.214 --> 26:19.182
Maybe. Have you figured
out what it says yet?

26:19.217 --> 26:20.283
No. What does it say?

26:20.318 --> 26:21.351
- What does what say?
- The puzzle.

26:21.385 --> 26:23.153
- What puzzle?
- You just admitted...

26:23.187 --> 26:24.955
I admit nothing.

26:28.392 --> 26:29.359
[sighs]

26:33.231 --> 26:38.969
Well, if you... if you lose
your job, we'll figure it out.

26:39.003 --> 26:41.972
- It's just...
- I won't have a baby.

26:42.006 --> 26:44.007
I don't want to be the reason
that you don't have a baby.

26:44.041 --> 26:46.142
It's... life is the reason, ok?

26:46.177 --> 26:48.178
Sometimes things are just not meant to be.

26:51.015 --> 26:54.217
Hey. Did you talk about
the cast party? Can I go?

26:54.252 --> 26:55.952
[sighs]

26:55.987 --> 26:57.320
What's wrong? Am I in trouble?

26:57.355 --> 26:59.122
- No, love.
- [Knocking]

27:01.943 --> 27:02.993
Hey.

27:03.027 --> 27:04.995
Hey. What're you grinning about?

27:05.029 --> 27:06.263
Ana recanted.

27:06.297 --> 27:08.398
[Mike, sighing] Said
she's wasn't even there

27:08.432 --> 27:11.201
at the time of the shooting.
D.A.'s dropping the investigation.

27:11.235 --> 27:12.369
Oh, my God.

27:12.403 --> 27:14.337
[Stef] You're kidding me?

27:14.372 --> 27:16.139
[Lena and Mariana chuckle]

27:16.173 --> 27:19.075
Wow. Congratulations, Mike. I'm so happy.

27:19.110 --> 27:20.410
[Mike] Me too.

27:20.428 --> 27:22.262
There's something you don't see every day.

27:22.296 --> 27:24.147
- Right?
- Hey, bud.

27:24.181 --> 27:25.982
I got your text, what's up?

27:26.017 --> 27:29.019
Ana changed her story. It's all over.

27:29.053 --> 27:30.353
That's great news.

27:32.223 --> 27:33.356
So, how does this affect your deposition?

27:33.391 --> 27:34.958
Well, it's dead, right?

27:34.992 --> 27:37.360
Yeah, it's dead.

27:37.428 --> 27:40.096
I'm gonna open a bottle of champagne.

27:40.114 --> 27:41.965
- Apple juice for me.
- You got it.

27:41.999 --> 27:44.134
- [cell phone rings]
- [Lena] Wow, so...

27:44.168 --> 27:45.435
- [Mike] Roberts called.
- [Lena] You're kidding.

27:45.469 --> 27:49.439
[Mike] Yeah, said the D.A.'s
office called her and...

27:51.275 --> 27:53.293
Hello?

27:53.327 --> 27:55.045
Yes.

27:56.414 --> 27:58.214
My dad called you?

28:00.151 --> 28:02.052
No, I understand.

28:03.220 --> 28:07.924
If you could just let me tell him first...

28:07.959 --> 28:09.159
Please.

28:10.962 --> 28:12.329
No, I will. I promise.

28:13.364 --> 28:15.031
Thank you.

28:15.066 --> 28:17.233
And I'm sorry to put you in this position.

28:17.268 --> 28:19.069
[approaching footsteps]

28:19.103 --> 28:21.972
Put who in what position?

28:22.006 --> 28:23.974
No one.

28:24.008 --> 28:25.942
You just had a conversation with no one?

28:31.349 --> 28:34.084
That was my piano teacher.

28:34.118 --> 28:36.419
I stopped going a few weeks
ago but I didn't tell my dad.

28:36.454 --> 28:38.088
And I kept the money.

28:38.122 --> 28:39.956
Why would you do that?

28:41.325 --> 28:44.361
I was gonna give it to Callie when
she was getting her own apartment.

28:44.395 --> 28:46.129
Oh, Brandon.

28:46.163 --> 28:48.365
I know. It was dumb.

28:50.067 --> 28:53.069
I'm going to tell my dad
and I'll give the money back.

28:53.104 --> 28:56.339
Ok, good. At least you didn't spend it.

28:57.408 --> 28:59.175

cast, that's not much of a party.

29:33.905 --> 29:36.490
Dude, help me get the rest.

29:37.709 --> 29:40.644
Ok, I'm not gonna do anything stupid.

29:40.679 --> 29:43.981
Oh, there's Chase. I'm gonna
go say hi. Be right back.

29:45.750 --> 29:48.619
So you think there's anything
to drink other than beer?

29:48.653 --> 29:51.722
There was a refreshments budget but
clearly I wasn't on that committee.

30:03.601 --> 30:04.852
You were so brilliant in the play.

30:04.903 --> 30:06.704
Did you always know you wanted to act?

30:06.738 --> 30:08.989
I always knew I wanted to change lives.

30:09.024 --> 30:10.941
You do. Every night.

30:10.975 --> 30:14.578
Hey, I got you a beer and one for myself.

30:14.612 --> 30:17.915
I would have gotten you one, but I
remember the last time you drank at a party.

30:17.982 --> 30:21.018
- Two words: Projectile vomit.
- Not true.

30:21.052 --> 30:23.854
It's ok, there's nothing to be ashamed
of, some girls are just lightweights.

30:25.890 --> 30:27.791
Um...

30:27.826 --> 30:30.678
you know, I'm gonna go
say hi to my leading lady.

Or what? I can't believe I ever
thought that you were friend.

30:37.669 --> 30:39.036
You know, you're just embarrassing
yourself in front of Chase.

30:39.070 --> 30:42.740
He sees you as a sophomore
fan girl and that's it.

30:42.774 --> 30:43.411
Oh yeah?

30:43.412 --> 30:46.711
Then why did you feel so threatened
you had to get me kicked off the play?

30:46.911 --> 30:49.780
Do I need to hose you two down with water?

30:49.814 --> 30:50.848
Hashtag cat fight.

30:53.535 --> 30:56.787
Cat fight? That was incredibly sexist.

30:56.821 --> 30:58.655
Is one of those for me?

30:58.689 --> 31:00.858
Well, one of them was, but
I don't want to be accused

31:00.892 --> 31:03.594
of being sexist for not
letting you get your own.

You got a thing for her.

32:01.686 --> 32:02.986

buy some beer for parties like you do.

32:09.894 --> 32:12.830
Don't bogart my business, man.

32:12.864 --> 32:14.998
Look, if you want to make some fast bank,

32:15.033 --> 32:16.633
why don't we sell some I.D.s?

32:16.668 --> 32:17.901
Isn't that, like, a felony?

32:57.842 --> 32:59.843
Well, this one time, I went to
a party and there was this guy

32:59.878 --> 33:01.945
I liked and I wasn't
sure if he was into me.

33:01.979 --> 33:05.849
So, I went in the bathroom and took off my
panties and slid them in his front pocket.

33:05.884 --> 33:06.984
That's a thing?

33:07.018 --> 33:08.919

tell me it was my brother.

33:15.844 --> 33:17.761
No, thanks.

33:26.888 --> 33:28.939
- Hi.
- Hey.

33:28.973 --> 33:32.709
I was just talking about
you. Your sister's in here.

33:32.744 --> 33:34.678
I know. She's with Callie.

33:34.712 --> 33:37.848
Oh. So that's why you're here.

33:37.882 --> 33:41.685
- I didn't know she was gonna be here.
- What a coincidence.

33:41.703 --> 33:45.789
Callie shows up and you follow her
around like a sad, little puppy.

33:45.823 --> 33:47.724
I think you've had enough to drink.

33:47.759 --> 33:50.761
I should probably just walk
away right now but I told you.

33:50.795 --> 33:53.864
I told you she wasn't into you and
you were just going to get hurt.

33:53.898 --> 33:56.667
You know what? I'm so sick

33:56.701 --> 34:00.003
of you and everyone else
telling me about my business.

34:00.038 --> 34:01.905
Ok, Callie is into me.

34:01.940 --> 34:04.575
We kissed at the wedding and
that's why she ran away with Wyatt.

34:04.609 --> 34:06.677
Because she didn't want
to mess up Jude's adoption.

34:06.711 --> 34:08.512
And the only reason we're
not together right now

34:08.545 --> 34:10.847
is because she needs a
family more than a boyfriend.

34:10.882 --> 34:13.984
So don't talk about things
you don't understand, ok?

34:21.559 --> 34:24.578
If you're interested,
I'll be waiting upstairs.

34:33.002 --> 34:35.870
- Hello, captain, come on in.
- Thanks.

34:35.888 --> 34:38.139
- Thank you for letting me swing by.
- Absolutely.

34:38.172 --> 34:42.010
I didn't want to have this
discussion at the station.

34:42.043 --> 34:46.014
- The D.A. e-mailed me your deposition.
- I see.

34:46.047 --> 34:49.016
Strangest thing, I...

34:49.051 --> 34:52.186
I can't get the damn thing
to open on my computer.

34:52.221 --> 34:55.822
But with Ana recanting and
the charges being dropped,

34:55.858 --> 34:57.825
I can't think of a reason to read it.

34:59.227 --> 35:00.962
Thank you.

35:00.996 --> 35:06.000
One thing, though, Foster, I.A.
took a lot of heat during all this.

35:06.035 --> 35:07.869
They're gonna keep their
eyes on both you and Mike.

35:07.903 --> 35:11.172
So I wouldn't give out so much as a
parking ticket without following procedure.

35:11.206 --> 35:13.207
- You got it.
- I'm serious,

35:13.242 --> 35:16.844
Not a whiff of impropriety,
or heads are going to roll.

35:16.879 --> 35:18.212
- Am I clear?
- Yes, ma'am.

35:18.247 --> 35:20.949
All right, I'll see you on Monday.

35:20.983 --> 35:22.817
Yes you will.

35:23.319 --> 35:24.886

35:24.920 --> 35:25.920

36:02.091 --> 36:03.992
Oh. Sorry, am I interrupting something?

It wasn't important. It's
just, Callie's looking for you.

It's my fault. I'm so stupid.

38:44.059 --> 38:45.927

38:45.961 --> 38:49.063
Because I can't stand how everyone
thinks you ran away to be with Wyatt.
