DAMON: Previously on
The Vampire Diaries...

00:03.719 --> 00:05.609
Alaric's babies
are the future of the coven.

00:05.840 --> 00:07.842
They would have protected them
in any way they could.

00:08.039 --> 00:09.087
They're inside of you.

00:09.240 --> 00:11.447
I totally get it
if you want to run for the hills.

00:11.680 --> 00:13.568
I'm not going anywhere,
because I love you.

00:13.760 --> 00:15.000
(SIGHS IN RELIEF)

00:15.920 --> 00:16.921
Marry me.

00:17.200 --> 00:18.440
- Yes.
-(CHUCKLES)

00:19.760 --> 00:21.922
I got Valerie pregnant. In 1863.

00:22.280 --> 00:24.601
Julian beat her
until the baby was no longer alive.

00:25.080 --> 00:27.367
I want him dead, Damon, now.

00:27.680 --> 00:30.968
He took her child from her.
And you would side with him?

00:31.360 --> 00:33.806
- No, what are you doing?
- This doesn't represent our love.

00:33.960 --> 00:34.961
Nora!

00:35.200 --> 00:37.965
Our mother went out of her way
to forget us forever.

00:38.120 --> 00:40.441
As far as I'm concerned,
she deserves what she gets.

00:40.760 --> 00:42.922
You're either a Salvatore
or you're one of us.

00:43.120 --> 00:45.088
You are wrong, Julian...

00:45.480 --> 00:46.891
-(GASPS)
- JULIAN: Lily!

00:47.080 --> 00:49.128
- Damon...
- Say something.

00:50.120 --> 00:52.964
You made your bed. Have a nice nap.

01:06.640 --> 01:08.005
VALERIE: Stefan, you can't go.

01:10.480 --> 01:11.811
She has Damon and Caroline.

01:12.640 --> 01:13.641
Because she wants you.

01:13.920 --> 01:17.811
Well, then she's gonna get me.
Oh, and I, uh... I burned my Porsche,

01:18.000 --> 01:19.684
so I kind of need to borrow your car.

01:19.840 --> 01:20.966
I'm coming with you.

01:21.160 --> 01:22.400
- No, you're not.
- Stefan.

01:22.920 --> 01:24.604
She already has two people
that I care about.

01:25.680 --> 01:26.966
(STEPHAN SIGHS)

01:27.680 --> 01:29.603
I'm not gonna let her have a third, okay?

01:31.160 --> 01:32.650
If anything happens to you,

01:32.840 --> 01:35.684
I will rain hell
down on anyone responsible.

01:36.840 --> 01:38.080
(CHUCKLES)

01:38.800 --> 01:40.211
Don't be so dramatic.

01:49.320 --> 01:50.526
(STEPHAN SIGHS)

01:53.320 --> 01:54.890
I'll be back before you know it.

02:48.760 --> 02:51.923
Well, this it?
This is the whole funeral party?

02:53.400 --> 02:54.606
Where's your girlfriend?

02:55.400 --> 02:56.845
Not your concern.

02:57.600 --> 02:58.931
Trouble in paradise?

03:00.400 --> 03:02.050
What about Julian? Where is he?

03:02.280 --> 03:04.123
I haven't heard
from either of them in days.

03:04.440 --> 03:06.886
I sided with Lily, or did you forget?

03:07.400 --> 03:10.563
It's just us, Beau couldn't bring himself
to say goodbye.

03:10.960 --> 03:14.123
Ah, I'm sure he just couldn't find
the right words to say. (SCOFFS)

03:15.400 --> 03:17.368
All right, let's get 'er done.

03:17.920 --> 03:20.924
Wait, we should say something.

03:21.280 --> 03:22.520
No, we shouldn't.

03:22.760 --> 03:24.364
Yes, we should.

03:34.480 --> 03:37.643
When I was a girl,
I loved my mother deeply.

03:38.640 --> 03:42.645
She loved me too, until she found out
about my little siphoning problem.

03:44.160 --> 03:47.130
If she only knew that was just
one of the things that made me different.

03:48.320 --> 03:53.087
When she turned her back on me, I thought
I'd never find that kind of love again.

03:55.640 --> 03:57.404
You proved me wrong.

03:59.840 --> 04:01.842
Thank you, Lily.

04:07.080 --> 04:08.320
Next.

04:13.680 --> 04:16.160
VALERIE: You knew me
at my brightest and my darkest.

04:17.360 --> 04:20.363
No matter what my mood,
you always saw the light in me.

04:23.360 --> 04:24.646
I'll miss you, Lily.

04:30.520 --> 04:34.366
Cream violets, you remembered.

04:35.360 --> 04:36.600
Of course, I did.

04:44.040 --> 04:45.530
Thank you.

04:50.720 --> 04:52.051
We'll leave you two.

05:02.880 --> 05:04.245
- Well.
- How many times

05:04.400 --> 05:07.404
do you get a second chance
to deliver your mother's eulogy?

05:10.480 --> 05:11.891
Good point, brother.

05:15.160 --> 05:16.400
How's this?

05:18.160 --> 05:19.400
(CLEARS TH ROAT)

05:19.560 --> 05:23.929
Lily, you were a terrible mother
when you were alive.

05:24.480 --> 05:26.562
And you were a terrible mother
when you were dead.

05:30.480 --> 05:32.767
You're right, that does feel good.

05:33.920 --> 05:35.206
Hmm.

05:52.840 --> 05:54.842
I'm so sorry.

05:56.960 --> 05:58.689
I promise I'll make this right.

06:13.440 --> 06:17.240
Last year, we filled 10 crates.
This year, I'm aiming for 20.

06:17.480 --> 06:18.970
STEFAN: You know,
compelling people to donate

06:19.200 --> 06:20.645
-doesn't actually count as donating.
-(SIGHS)

06:21.040 --> 06:23.964
Wait 'till you see me. I popped this week.

06:24.920 --> 06:25.967
I have a pot belly.

06:26.120 --> 06:28.407
Yeah? Put on a Santa hat
and you'd fit right in here.

06:29.080 --> 06:30.161
Sure you don't need me over there?

06:30.320 --> 06:32.766
To do what?
Come to boring birthing classes?

06:34.320 --> 06:37.483
You're chasing after an immortal jerk
who basically killed your mother.

06:38.000 --> 06:40.810
That's much more important.
I can handle this.

06:41.160 --> 06:43.731
Of course you can.

06:44.480 --> 06:45.925
Caroline ? Still there ?

06:46.120 --> 06:49.249
Yes, here. How are you?

06:49.440 --> 06:52.011
I'm good. I'd be a lot better
if my traveling companion

06:52.160 --> 06:56.006
would actually stick to task instead of
stopping by every single bar we pass by.

06:56.160 --> 06:58.162
It's a pub crawl, Stef.
That's the whole point.

06:58.760 --> 07:02.162
Don't be such a Grinch,
or you'll get coal in your stocking.

07:02.760 --> 07:05.525
And that's my cue. I'll call you later.

07:09.800 --> 07:12.371
"Hey, Stefan, did I mention
Bonnie saw me mix a blood bag

07:12.520 --> 07:14.170
"with a jar of mayonnaise
at 2:00 in the morning?"

07:14.360 --> 07:16.488
Okay, one, that was marshmallow fluff,

07:16.680 --> 07:19.445
and two, I'm feeding for three now,
so I get cravings.

07:19.640 --> 07:21.529
Fair, why not just tell him?

07:21.680 --> 07:23.682
Because he doesn't need to worry
about the specifics

07:23.880 --> 07:26.690
of my magical pregnancy
with Alaric's babies.

07:26.960 --> 07:29.611
Words that should probably not be spoken
at that volume.

07:30.200 --> 07:31.486
You ready to go to this class?

07:32.440 --> 07:33.487
Now I am.

07:33.720 --> 07:36.564
You know it's a birthing class,
right, Caroline? And not SAT prep.

07:37.440 --> 07:38.726
You sure you can handle this on your own?

07:38.880 --> 07:41.121
If you can handle all of this
while pregnant,

07:41.320 --> 07:44.210
I can handle a fraction of it while not.
Go to your class.

07:45.160 --> 07:48.004
That was the least graphic one
I could find. Study up.

07:51.040 --> 07:52.326

07:53.040 --> 07:58.171
So, what's it gonna be?
"Uncle Stefan"? "Unkie Steffie"?

07:58.360 --> 07:59.407
Hmm.

07:59.560 --> 08:03.531
Oh, I got it. "Creepy dude,
who hangs out with Mom, who's not Dad."

08:03.720 --> 08:06.485
Ooh, see, the thing is,
she's not their mom.

08:06.720 --> 08:09.087
Oh, come on, it's Caroline,
you think she's gonna turn those kids over

08:09.240 --> 08:12.369
to a functioning alcoholic
with no supervision? (SCOFFS)

08:12.560 --> 08:13.766
Whatever she wants to do.

08:14.000 --> 08:19.086
So diplomatic,
you're gonna make an amazing not-father.

08:21.400 --> 08:22.526
What's that, Damon?

08:22.720 --> 08:25.451
Just barely not being a father.

08:25.600 --> 08:26.726
Oh, wow.

08:26.920 --> 08:30.447
You know, in these last few weeks,
yourjokes have gotten quite sad.

08:30.600 --> 08:33.046
You know what?
You need me, little brother.

08:33.280 --> 08:35.442
Sucks for you,
but Julian's almost 500 years old

08:35.600 --> 08:36.931
and you ain't taking him alone,

08:37.120 --> 08:41.727
no matter how many vervain darts
and stakes you have on you. (CHUCKLES)

08:41.919 --> 08:45.606
What I need, Damon, is your actions,
not your words.

08:45.760 --> 08:47.603
Soundshke
you should've brought Beau, then.

08:47.760 --> 08:49.091
Hmm.

08:49.360 --> 08:51.124
I'm here to help, trust me,

08:51.360 --> 08:54.443
I've got more vervain syringes
and grenades strapped to my body.

08:54.600 --> 08:58.400
One wrong step
and I'm vampire shrapnel, relax.

09:20.160 --> 09:21.446
Is he coming back?

09:21.760 --> 09:22.807
None of your concern.

I'll just grab them and be on my way.

Have you seen her?

09:34.320 --> 09:35.606
We've spoken.

09:38.680 --> 09:43.527
This is your fault, you know,
this fracturing.

09:43.760 --> 09:45.410
Yeah. If only I hadn't fallen in love

09:45.640 --> 09:48.644
and placed my pregnant womb
in front of Julian's boot.

09:48.840 --> 09:50.763
(SCOFFS) Sticking to your story, are you?

09:50.960 --> 09:52.007
It's not a story.

Even if, by some stretch
of the imagination, it's not,

09:56.840 --> 09:59.810
the timing is awfully suspect, isn't it?

09:59.960 --> 10:01.007
What's that supposed to mean?

10:01.200 --> 10:04.204
Well, you had over a 100 years
to tell this story

10:04.440 --> 10:07.046
and you only did
once you were back in Stefan's life,

10:07.360 --> 10:10.523
'till it served you, gained you sympathy.

10:12.640 --> 10:16.645
I always thought you were the nice one
and that you had a heart, deep down.

10:16.880 --> 10:21.044
Guess I was wrong.
Nora will blossom without you.

10:36.480 --> 10:37.891
You appear tired.

10:40.040 --> 10:43.408
Nora, how unexpected.
What are you doing here?

10:43.560 --> 10:46.245
Uh, I have a toy for a tot. (CHUCKLES)

10:47.400 --> 10:48.640
- You shouldn't have.
- I didn't,

10:48.840 --> 10:50.922
actually, it was a passive-aggressive gift

10:51.160 --> 10:52.810
for when Mary Louise came
crawling back to me,

10:53.040 --> 10:55.247
but that hasn't happened, so...

10:56.360 --> 10:57.850
Still very generous of you.

10:58.080 --> 10:59.320
I know.

11:00.320 --> 11:04.245
Okay, You delivered it.
(SARCASTICALLY) Yay! That's the end.

11:04.400 --> 11:06.926
But how will the tot know
the toy is from me?

11:07.240 --> 11:08.571
I'll tell them.

11:10.680 --> 11:12.444
And you're still not leaving.

11:12.600 --> 11:16.161
I want to be more involved.
See, I recently enrolled in classes, and--

11:16.400 --> 11:17.731
You're going to school here? Why?

11:17.920 --> 11:22.528
Because I was curious about college
and, well, Mary Louise hated the idea, so.

11:22.720 --> 11:24.768
Spite. That's a good reason
for higher education.

11:25.400 --> 11:27.129
Look. You clearly need help.

11:27.360 --> 11:30.443
Not from an evil heretic
who kidnapped my friend.

11:31.440 --> 11:34.444
Are you really going to let that old news
get in the way of a little charity?

11:35.360 --> 11:36.600
And I'm evil?

11:38.120 --> 11:40.600
Collection booth. The far one.

11:41.280 --> 11:45.808
Like, way over there.
Yeah, you see it? See?

12:03.120 --> 12:06.283
Just so we're clear,
me helping you kill Julian

12:06.480 --> 12:07.481
is your Christmas present.

12:07.640 --> 12:10.166
So, don't be expecting
any socks or TV or anything.

12:10.400 --> 12:12.004
Yeah, look, we gotta find him to kill him.

12:12.240 --> 12:14.641
We will. Bonnie did a locator spell
and she said Sunbury.

12:14.920 --> 12:16.843
We're in Sunbury, so...

12:17.320 --> 12:18.606
Oops.

12:35.440 --> 12:40.287
Merry Christmas, brother.
I think we found him.

12:49.280 --> 12:52.011
Gonna be a lot of disappointed faces
Christmas morning.

12:52.600 --> 12:55.331
Yeah, well maybe if we hadn't stopped
at every single bar for eggnog,

12:55.480 --> 12:56.527
we could have done something about it.

12:56.680 --> 12:59.047
Yeah, and maybe have been two more bodies
in this pile.

12:59.280 --> 13:01.123
- What are you trying to say?
- I'm not trying to say anything.

13:01.320 --> 13:04.449
What I am saying is maybe we should just
take a little bit of a beat, you know?

13:04.640 --> 13:08.167
I mean, look around, Julian is clearly off
the proverbial rails here.

13:08.360 --> 13:10.328
What? Since when do you think logically?

13:10.560 --> 13:12.562
Hi. I'm level-headed Damon.

13:12.800 --> 13:14.689
I only come out
when Stefan goes a little cuckoo.

13:14.880 --> 13:17.884
And since you're letting your mommy
and "Could've been daddy" issues

13:18.120 --> 13:19.167
drive you right now...

13:19.360 --> 13:21.488
So, you don't think that
Julian deserves to die?

13:21.960 --> 13:23.200
I do, 100%.

13:23.480 --> 13:24.720
But not if it means us dying.

13:24.960 --> 13:27.884
So, I think we should just stop
and think about some backup.

13:28.160 --> 13:29.844
You are my backup.
You're just terrible at it.

13:30.040 --> 13:32.930
And if Julian's off the rails, then good.
It means he's careless.

13:33.200 --> 13:34.565
I mean, look at these wounds,
they're fresh.

13:34.720 --> 13:37.724
Which means he's obviously still in town.
So, either you help me find him, or...

13:37.960 --> 13:40.566
Don't be so dramatic, Stefan, I got this.

13:41.960 --> 13:44.122
-(SIGHS) Pick up.

- Ah, Bon-Bon.

13:47.240 --> 13:48.287
Sorry to do this to you, but--

13:48.520 --> 13:50.124
What a lovely way to be greeted.

13:50.400 --> 13:51.811
"Hey, Bonnie, I need something."

13:52.040 --> 13:53.929
Well, isn't it so great
to feel loved and needed?

13:54.360 --> 13:55.566
So. Julian.

13:55.760 --> 13:57.444
Yeah, I've already done a locator spell.

13:57.640 --> 13:58.926
Yes, yes, you did.

13:59.120 --> 14:01.248
Which led us
to this Santa-infested hellhole.

14:01.440 --> 14:04.808
But is there, like, a way to do,
like, a zoom-in spell or something

14:05.040 --> 14:06.963

You, of all people,
should not be the one to give up.

You're the reason that he's alive

27:13.200 --> 27:14.884
What kind of backwards-ass logic is that?

27:15.040 --> 27:17.566
Because we would've killed Julian
the minute he showed up into our lives.

27:17.800 --> 27:20.531

And you practically spat in her face.

27:37.760 --> 27:39.171
She didn't deserve my forgiveness.
