00:11.760 --> 00:14.491
The Parthenays came at my behest.

00:15.080 --> 00:17.003
My personal invitation.

00:17.360 --> 00:21.763
They drove their carriage on that road
knowing they were guests of the King.

00:22.640 --> 00:25.291
With the King's
guaranteed protection.

00:28.720 --> 00:31.564
If a child of France
isn't safe on royal lands

00:31.720 --> 00:34.007
what chance is there
for anyone else?

00:36.760 --> 00:39.730
An attack on my roads
is an attack on me.

00:40.680 --> 00:43.570
Until their killers are apprehended
I'll not sleep.

00:45.400 --> 00:48.165
I will pay my respects.
Where are they?

00:48.320 --> 00:50.766
(Bontemps)
Sire, you're bleeding, injured.

00:50.920 --> 00:52.604
More than you can know.

00:54.000 --> 01:00.074

01:05.880 --> 01:06.880
Where you going?

01:07.000 --> 01:09.685
The siege is broken.
The battle is won.

01:10.120 --> 01:11.201
The price is paid.

01:12.520 --> 01:13.851
The camp lies this way.

01:16.520 --> 01:18.761
I promised mother
I'd bring them home.

01:27.120 --> 01:28.531
Cold lotion, sire.

01:28.680 --> 01:32.401
Made of egg yolk,
oil of roses, and turpentine

01:32.560 --> 01:33.925
to permit drainage.

01:34.520 --> 01:36.727
Why not simply close the skin?

01:38.440 --> 01:42.604
Permissible for the battlefield injuries
sire, but I'm no tailor.

01:42.760 --> 01:44.922
May I inquire as to the cause, sire?

01:45.080 --> 01:47.082
(Bontemps) A hunting accident.

01:49.800 --> 01:53.247
We report with joy
the success of the king's infantry.

01:53.400 --> 01:55.607
Against the Spanish troops.

01:56.080 --> 01:58.606
Siege is now laid to
the town of Cambrai.

01:58.760 --> 02:01.730
At last some good news.

02:01.880 --> 02:05.407
(Bontemps) Most remarkable
of all the King's heros present

02:05.560 --> 02:07.528
is his Majesty's own brother,

02:07.680 --> 02:10.650
Prince Philippe, the Duke of Orleans

02:10.800 --> 02:12.882
who has shown bravery in the field.

02:13.040 --> 02:14.565
That's enough news.

02:14.920 --> 02:17.366
(Bontemps)
A true and everlasting hero...

02:17.520 --> 02:18.851
I said enough!

02:19.280 --> 02:24.411
(Intro music)

02:24.560 --> 02:29.202
<i>* I'm the king of my own land,</i>

02:34.440 --> 02:37.649
<i>* Facing tempests of dust,</i>

02:37.800 --> 02:42.283
<i>* I'll fight until the end.</i>

02:46.480 --> 02:52.123
* <i>Creatures of my dreams,
rise up and dance with me!</i>

03:00.880 --> 03:08.489
<i>* Now and forever,
* I'm your king.</i>

03:43.200 --> 03:44.565
Let me see FranÃ§oise.

04:18.480 --> 04:20.322
He bled a lot but she did not.

04:20.920 --> 04:23.526
(Masson)
I think his wound was a pistol, Sire

04:23.680 --> 04:27.366
whilst hers was a musket shot
which bleeds less

04:28.400 --> 04:29.561
Why?

04:31.320 --> 04:34.529
Well, that is the way
wounds behave, Sire.

04:34.680 --> 04:36.091
The wounds are large...

04:36.320 --> 04:38.402
Which surely produces
more not less.

04:38.560 --> 04:42.849
Indeed, Sire, but, um, the er...

04:43.000 --> 04:45.446
(Claudine)
What my father is saying is

04:45.600 --> 04:48.206
that the musket shot
tends to fragment making

04:48.920 --> 04:50.410
channels twice as large

04:50.560 --> 04:53.450
but also crushes the flesh
around the wound

04:53.600 --> 04:56.809
so it seals the blood
where it sits and it cannot flow.

04:58.160 --> 05:01.687
I see. Thank you,
(tersely) Masson.

05:10.880 --> 05:13.611
- And Charlotte? (Masson)
- Charlotte?

05:14.680 --> 05:18.162
The Parthenays had two children
and I'm Charlotte's godfather.

05:18.760 --> 05:21.161
(angrily) - Find Fabien!
- At once, Sire.

06:09.440 --> 06:14.440
(crows cawing, conspiratorial music)

06:43.480 --> 06:49.283
(sighing)

06:55.800 --> 06:58.201
(Charlotte, faintly)
Can you help me?

07:00.080 --> 07:01.206
How?

07:03.320 --> 07:04.685
I'm sorry.

07:07.640 --> 07:09.483
But you will not be alone.

07:10.000 --> 07:11.968
I saw angels.

07:31.920 --> 07:34.571
(Thunder rolling)

07:40.720 --> 07:43.644
(Montcourt snoring)

07:45.520 --> 07:46.965
(Cassel) You were so...

07:47.120 --> 07:50.567
drunk last night,
you pissed all over my kitchen.

07:50.720 --> 07:53.724
So consider this merely
the repayment of that loan.

07:54.600 --> 07:57.729
(panting and trembling)

07:57.880 --> 08:00.565
- Where is my share?
- I have it right here

08:00.720 --> 08:02.563
(Montcourt wheezing)
Is that

08:03.040 --> 08:06.044
enough, or would you like
some more?

08:06.200 --> 08:08.601
You murder a noble family
on the road

08:08.760 --> 08:11.161
and then come to my house.

08:11.560 --> 08:12.846
She knew my voice

08:13.240 --> 08:15.288
(Cassel)
How is that even possible?

08:15.440 --> 08:18.728
Unlikely, but I couldn't take the risk.

08:18.880 --> 08:21.884
In any case you wanted chaos.

08:22.240 --> 08:23.240
Now you have it.

08:23.320 --> 08:26.688
You butchered them where they stood.
Every single one.

08:27.000 --> 08:28.081
Not quite.

08:28.600 --> 08:29.806
A young girl escaped.

08:30.320 --> 08:32.971
She ran into the woods - wounded.

08:33.120 --> 08:36.442
- You didn't think to follow?
- I didn't think it safe.

08:37.480 --> 08:39.482
Well, return and finish it.

08:39.960 --> 08:42.566
My Lord, think a moment.

08:42.919 --> 08:45.400
Noble blood spilled
on the way to Versailles.

08:46.080 --> 08:48.401
Who would follow the Parthenays now?

08:48.560 --> 08:52.485
Soon the King will tire of the project
and retire to Paris.

08:53.200 --> 08:55.601
And then we shall own our country again.

09:03.440 --> 09:06.011
He only sketches when he's upset.

09:29.440 --> 09:31.761
Who else delays?

09:32.640 --> 09:34.768
(Colbert)
Fourteen families in all.

09:35.080 --> 09:38.971
All await assurance for their safety
before venturing on the road.

09:39.240 --> 09:42.164
So the Southern nobles stay quiet,
the East: cowards

09:43.040 --> 09:46.647
- and the North.
- Without Cassel, no help from them.

09:46.920 --> 09:48.763
A man of great influence

09:48.920 --> 09:51.685
- Perception of influence.
- Just as dangerous.

09:51.960 --> 09:55.487
Why do we still feel surrounded
in Cambrai when it's our siege?

09:55.640 --> 09:56.721
(door opens)

09:58.160 --> 09:59.764
Monsieur Marchal's here.

10:04.320 --> 10:05.731
(door closes)

10:20.640 --> 10:22.927
You've failed me, Monsieur Marchal.

10:23.080 --> 10:25.651
Just as you've failed the Parthenays

10:25.800 --> 10:28.326
With secure roads
they'd have been safe.

10:28.640 --> 10:30.847
Instead their deaths
send a message

10:31.000 --> 10:33.401
that traveling to Versailles
is not safe.

10:33.760 --> 10:37.481
Your continued presence demands
nothing less than absolution.

10:38.640 --> 10:40.483
Bring me those responsible!

10:42.080 --> 10:43.730
(Fabien) May I speak, Sire?

10:45.560 --> 10:47.767
I believe a noble may be responsible.

10:48.320 --> 10:49.924
How would you know?

10:51.240 --> 10:54.449
The musket shot that killed her
was fired from a horse.

10:54.600 --> 10:57.763
The angle shows that the horse
was many hands high.

10:57.920 --> 11:00.605
Almost impossible
for the untrained rider.

11:00.760 --> 11:03.081
Only a nobleman, an equerry

11:03.240 --> 11:05.447
a cavalryman could
be capable of it.

11:06.640 --> 11:08.722
But most of our men
are at the front.

11:09.080 --> 11:11.401
Which as I say leads suspicion firmly

11:11.960 --> 11:13.121
with a noble.

11:13.680 --> 11:16.490
Whoever it is, bring them to me.

11:17.280 --> 11:19.123
I want to see their face.

11:33.520 --> 11:35.090
(whistles)

11:39.920 --> 11:42.366
Sophie, listen to me.

11:42.520 --> 11:43.806
What have I done?

11:44.280 --> 11:46.965
Don't make eyes at boys like that.

11:47.320 --> 11:49.129
You only have eyes for the King.

11:49.280 --> 11:51.442
Even if I succeed
and you marry a noble

11:51.600 --> 11:53.682
men at court are
just a stepping stone

11:53.840 --> 11:55.888
nothing more and nothing less.

11:56.040 --> 11:58.247
Men like that are pond scum.

11:58.400 --> 12:00.528
Do you understand?

12:00.880 --> 12:03.167
I don't think that's everything.

12:03.320 --> 12:06.642
Oh, you're still young.
You can be sure of it.

12:07.520 --> 12:08.520
(Bontemps)
Go on.

12:12.080 --> 12:14.686
(Fabien) Your plan was ill-conceived
and inept.

12:14.840 --> 12:16.968
200 men would
have held the road.

12:17.120 --> 12:19.407
From where?
Our soldiers are fighting.

12:19.560 --> 12:21.005
There's your problem.

12:21.160 --> 12:24.562
It's a problem we all face
and a threat to the King.

12:25.200 --> 12:27.726
It may even be a solution.

12:27.880 --> 12:29.325
(Bontemps) A solution?

12:30.280 --> 12:31.361
I don't yet know.

12:31.680 --> 12:34.570
But one thing's for sure.
They will strike again.

12:47.400 --> 12:48.845
(panting, whimpering)

12:51.440 --> 12:54.967
(tense music)

12:55.120 --> 12:56.167
(a shot)

13:02.880 --> 13:07.044
If the court knows she's dead,
they can mourn.

13:07.200 --> 13:09.089
(Fabien)
They think they all died.

13:09.240 --> 13:10.321
(Sighs)

13:10.480 --> 13:14.724
The Parthenay family were murdered
on the road. Everyone speaks of it.

13:15.040 --> 13:16.883
Her body wasn't found there.

13:17.040 --> 13:19.611
Only three people know
this information.

13:20.200 --> 13:23.921
Me, you and the man
who meant to kill her.

13:25.720 --> 13:28.166
He will know his shot
missed its mark.

13:28.480 --> 13:31.529
And he might yet use that knowledge
to make a mistake.

13:34.800 --> 13:40.489
(intriguing music and footsteps)

13:57.880 --> 13:59.530
Forgive me.

13:59.680 --> 14:01.205
It's no matter.

14:01.720 --> 14:02.960
You are ill perhaps?

14:03.120 --> 14:06.203
No, if anything I feel nervous
about this war.

14:07.960 --> 14:09.769
The glory will soon be ours.

14:10.320 --> 14:13.802
You're already glorious, Sire
if I may be so bold.

14:19.080 --> 14:20.570
You may, Madame.

14:26.840 --> 14:27.840
Be well!

14:34.480 --> 14:40.522
(confident music)

14:40.680 --> 14:41.841
Majesty!

14:42.000 --> 14:49.043
(Music swells)
(Courtier) Lisette told me...

14:49.200 --> 14:51.328
she begged her husband
not to come.

14:51.480 --> 14:54.051
After the Parthenays fate
who could blame her.

14:54.200 --> 14:56.885
But with the King's new edict
he said they had to

14:57.040 --> 14:59.725
that they must find a sponsor
or be doomed.

14:59.880 --> 15:02.247
(Montespan)
I heard they've got no papers.

15:03.040 --> 15:05.520
They had a flood a few years back.

15:05.680 --> 15:08.490
What if they washed away?
Poor lambs.

15:08.800 --> 15:09.961
There'd be a remedy.

15:11.400 --> 15:13.164
That is yet to be seen.

15:13.560 --> 15:15.881
Not everyone has such credit.

15:16.600 --> 15:19.365
As much as wants to give
is as much as I have.

15:19.520 --> 15:23.047
If the coffers are empty,
your daughter is good security.

15:24.120 --> 15:25.690
Beauty unlocks many doors.

15:26.280 --> 15:28.726
(Beatrice) You should know, Madame.

15:28.880 --> 15:31.724
Beauty without wit is merely vanity.

15:34.600 --> 15:35.806
Mmmm!
(Sophie) Mother!

15:36.320 --> 15:37.367
That was unkind.

15:38.200 --> 15:40.407
Have you been paying
attention at all?

15:41.120 --> 15:45.364
When you enter this court,
it's not a room, it's a marketplace.

15:45.520 --> 15:49.241
And transactions mean contacts.
And contacts mean credit.

15:50.000 --> 15:53.971
Credit means power.
Power means everything!

15:55.200 --> 15:57.009
Look at Madame De Montespan.

15:57.160 --> 15:59.686
Do you think her attention
happens by chance?

15:59.840 --> 16:02.047
- I thought you hated her.
- Keep quiet!

16:02.200 --> 16:04.931
I saw the King look at her today.

16:05.080 --> 16:06.889
A deep and lingering gaze.

16:07.040 --> 16:09.122
Just think what that might be worth!

16:09.280 --> 16:11.487
And what does all this
matter to us?

16:11.640 --> 16:14.166
- We have our papers and lineage.
- Not yet!

16:14.320 --> 16:17.847
What could happen to a piece of paper
coming from Pau?

16:18.000 --> 16:19.843
Ask the Parthenays!

16:20.000 --> 16:23.243
(intriguing music)

16:28.840 --> 16:31.571
(Louis and Rohan laughing)

16:31.720 --> 16:34.451
That was when she had the bows
in her hair!

16:34.600 --> 16:36.489
Yes, the picnic.
Midsummer.

16:36.880 --> 16:39.850
- I was angry at you. (Rohan)
- FranÃ§oise chose me but

16:40.200 --> 16:43.249
- she only had eyes for you. (Louis)
- So I'd be jealous!

16:43.400 --> 16:45.209
And she was successful.

16:45.360 --> 16:47.601
(Louis and Rohan laugh)

16:48.480 --> 16:50.448
Thank you, friend I needed this.

16:51.040 --> 16:52.804
We should celebrate tonight.

16:52.960 --> 16:57.090
And every night after that. I shall tie
a bow on the next pretty woman

16:57.240 --> 16:58.924
I see and call her FranÃ§oise.

16:59.080 --> 17:01.048
(laughing)

17:02.400 --> 17:06.246
(Rohan) - What about her!
- Her you do not touch.

17:11.480 --> 17:13.130
(Rohan sighing) Shame!

17:21.079 --> 17:23.731
I've a position I was hoping
you might take.

17:23.880 --> 17:25.325
Of course.
What is it?

17:25.480 --> 17:28.563
The stables are finished
and the hunt needs a master.

17:29.840 --> 17:31.285
I know just the man.

17:31.440 --> 17:33.010
I was hoping you did.

17:33.400 --> 17:36.324
- It'd be my pleasure.
- Please, send me his name

17:36.840 --> 17:39.446
Because I need to act
while you go to war.

17:40.440 --> 17:41.202
War?

17:41.360 --> 17:45.081
With the war, I find my brother
foremost in my mind.

17:45.240 --> 17:46.321
Of course.

17:46.480 --> 17:49.324
I wish you to go to the front.
Shadow my brother.

17:49.480 --> 17:51.881
See no harm comes to him.

17:52.040 --> 17:53.644
I think I understand you.

17:53.800 --> 17:55.245
Well, it's been a long time.

18:00.360 --> 18:02.089
I will do as you ask.

18:05.400 --> 18:06.765
(smiling)

18:10.800 --> 18:12.450
That's the Rohan I remember.

18:24.000 --> 18:26.685
(Chevalier) Misery suits you.
You wear it well.

18:27.600 --> 18:28.600
D'you want?

18:28.800 --> 18:31.644
You read The Gazette?
Your husband is glorious.

18:31.800 --> 18:34.849
- It is the King's glory.
- Not from what I read.

18:35.000 --> 18:38.368
I leave you my copy
to peruse at your leisure.

18:38.600 --> 18:40.841
As you pine
for your absent husband.

18:41.560 --> 18:44.131
You'll be delighted
when he claims his prize.

18:44.280 --> 18:46.521
Angelique,
please put in another ribbon.

18:46.680 --> 18:48.762
AngÃ©lique,
I meant to return this.

18:48.920 --> 18:51.446
A chambermaid found it
in your drawer and

18:52.360 --> 18:55.011
took it in error.
I'll see she's disciplined.

18:56.440 --> 18:57.440
My necklace!

18:58.120 --> 19:00.043
Did you say your necklace?

19:00.200 --> 19:03.249
Yes, it's very dear to me.
I thought it lost.

19:04.560 --> 19:05.560
AngÃ©lique?

19:06.640 --> 19:09.086
Come now, the maid thought it yours.

19:09.240 --> 19:11.720
So what was it doing in your room?

19:12.640 --> 19:16.201
- It was not in my room.
- Of course it was I just told you.

19:16.560 --> 19:20.326
- What was it doing in your room?
- Madame, I did not take it.

19:21.080 --> 19:22.411
Absolutely I did not.

19:23.120 --> 19:24.120
- Be quiet!

19:24.600 --> 19:26.967
Your lady's a thief, Madame.
That is clear.

19:27.440 --> 19:30.762
And I doubt you're in the habit
of employing pickpockets.

19:31.960 --> 19:34.122
Be sure
you've not heard the last of it

19:55.560 --> 19:57.528
I wish to make peace with God.

19:57.800 --> 20:01.964
A convent near Marly will take me.
They've already given their consent.

20:02.560 --> 20:06.326
I beg you sire, please,
release me to God's care.

20:07.320 --> 20:08.651
You've had everything.

20:10.080 --> 20:13.050
I used to think I was
a person of quality,

20:13.200 --> 20:14.964
living under God's grace.

20:15.880 --> 20:19.441
The gift he bestowed upon me,
upon both of us.

20:20.280 --> 20:22.521
Now I know neither my person
nor place.

20:23.600 --> 20:25.329
I just want to serve my God.

20:25.480 --> 20:27.847
I love your piety.

20:28.480 --> 20:30.960
I love your spirit
in the service of purity.

20:31.120 --> 20:35.489
And I wish to go before you tire of me.

20:38.400 --> 20:39.561
My Lady!

20:45.640 --> 20:47.404
I already see it.

20:47.560 --> 20:51.724
I will soon be gone in your eyes
and I see who is to come after me.

20:52.440 --> 20:54.920
I do not wish
to bear witness for myself.

20:55.560 --> 20:58.086
- God wishes us together.
- Sire, please...

20:59.480 --> 21:04.008
Not as my king but as father to my
children - and the one yet to be born.

21:05.720 --> 21:07.882
Let me atone for my life.

21:08.840 --> 21:11.002
What if I'm to burn for eternity?

21:11.160 --> 21:12.525
What if it's too late?

21:17.880 --> 21:21.089
(crying)

21:22.080 --> 21:25.641
(court chatter and music)

21:25.800 --> 21:26.961
(Beatrice, laughing)

21:27.120 --> 21:29.964
Cousin! You seem in a very good mood

21:30.120 --> 21:32.566
You'd be joyful with such gifts
around me.

21:32.720 --> 21:34.370
Such beauty!

21:35.040 --> 21:38.601
Talking of which, Henriette's entourage
was looking a bit tired

21:38.960 --> 21:42.009
so I have made an opportunity for my
darling girl.

21:42.440 --> 21:45.569
- With Henriette?
- I do not care for your tone.

21:46.160 --> 21:47.889
Should Sophie stay with her

21:48.040 --> 21:50.850
when Mme De Montespan
grows in stature daily?

21:51.360 --> 21:54.443
- I saw a gaze from the King...
- My decision is made.

21:56.200 --> 22:00.603
And I'm head of this household.
Unless you've somehow forgotten, cousin.

22:02.120 --> 22:03.849
When's the position available?

22:04.000 --> 22:06.924
Soon. I hear one of her ladies
is fond of pilfering.

22:07.080 --> 22:09.003
(laughing) Come child!

22:09.160 --> 22:11.208
(courtly dance music)

22:11.360 --> 22:14.921
It's time you learned
what to do with those flippers you call

22:15.080 --> 22:16.080
feet!

22:19.440 --> 22:24.440
(Chevalier claps for more dance music)
(The dance begins)

22:29.640 --> 22:33.440
A dance is a formalized
conversation, my dear Sophie.

22:33.720 --> 22:36.929
Full of rules, restrictions.

22:37.080 --> 22:38.889
It's like your dress.

22:39.040 --> 22:40.849
(Sophie) Do you like it?

22:41.000 --> 22:42.968
- Can't you tell?
- (Squeaks) Oh!

22:43.760 --> 22:45.171
(Chevalier giggles)

22:47.000 --> 22:53.884
(They continue to dance)
(The viols play)

22:54.040 --> 22:57.726
I never asked you but I'd wager
it's important for your time here

22:57.880 --> 22:59.928
Are you still intact?

23:01.360 --> 23:02.805
Intact?

23:02.960 --> 23:06.248
Have your fingers ever been curious?

23:08.840 --> 23:11.286
I don't know what you're talking about.

23:11.440 --> 23:12.646
You will!

23:13.000 --> 23:18.882
(They circle and continue dancing)

23:19.040 --> 23:21.566
(A lustful 'Ahhhh')

23:24.080 --> 23:27.880
When we skimmed stones on the water
in Saint-Germain, you remember?

23:29.920 --> 23:33.049
I declared to everyone
yours would bounce five times.

23:33.840 --> 23:36.730
You all laughed I might
declare it so confidently.

23:37.320 --> 23:40.164
And yet, when you launched the stones

23:40.840 --> 23:42.251
There it was!

23:43.800 --> 23:46.121
- Five times.
- My lucky number.

23:58.960 --> 24:03.045
I want to do this every night
so I'll know you'll keep me safe.

24:03.320 --> 24:04.845
Do I not already?

24:06.000 --> 24:10.483
Sadly, where the Chevalier is concerned
I cannot see how anyone can.

24:19.080 --> 24:21.287
He's caused my AngÃ©lique great pain.

24:22.000 --> 24:25.800
As well as you,
must I also protect your ladies?

24:25.960 --> 24:29.248
He made up a terrible story
and put a problem in my lap.

24:32.240 --> 24:33.605
And now you're sad.

24:33.760 --> 24:36.730
(Louis) You're perceptive, Madame.

24:38.200 --> 24:41.283
FranÃ§oise Parthenay
was very dear to you I know.

24:41.760 --> 24:44.366
I was even jealous of her
for a silly minute.

24:47.560 --> 24:50.404
I'm going to war where it's safe.

24:51.480 --> 24:54.165
- I do not understand.
- And you're coming too.

24:54.480 --> 24:56.130
- Why?
- You wish not to?

24:59.240 --> 25:01.083
- A new day comes.
- Good night!

25:02.280 --> 25:03.327
Goodbye.

25:12.480 --> 25:14.767
I'm a little early for my lesson

25:18.320 --> 25:19.685
(Chevalier panting)

25:21.080 --> 25:23.845
Don't say a word.

25:25.720 --> 25:27.961
(panting, groaning)

25:28.120 --> 25:30.885
(drums beating)

25:31.040 --> 25:33.646
Oh, my God, quiet!

25:33.800 --> 25:35.564
Quiet!

25:35.720 --> 25:39.611
(Unseen man) Your constant infidelity
makes you an easy man to find.

25:39.760 --> 25:43.481
From this moment on,
I will tell you what to do.

25:43.640 --> 25:45.927
Deny us and you will die!

25:46.080 --> 25:49.766
Apply yourself
and your lover will be king.

25:49.920 --> 25:51.524
And you will have the power.

25:51.680 --> 25:57.050
The future is yours <i>as</i> long as you do
exactly what we tell you.

25:58.880 --> 26:00.882
We will talk again.

26:02.600 --> 26:08.607
(Chevalier grunting
and groaning desperately)

26:27.760 --> 26:28.760
Maman?

26:31.560 --> 26:32.686
Go back to sleep.

26:33.880 --> 26:35.086
What are you doing?

26:36.640 --> 26:37.926
Writing letters.

26:56.720 --> 26:57.767
Rest, child.

27:20.920 --> 27:26.723
(courtly music playing)

27:31.520 --> 27:34.091
The monk from PÃ©rignon
has brought more wine.

27:34.960 --> 27:37.167
And I am still hungry.

27:41.320 --> 27:42.685
Will you join me?

27:43.760 --> 27:45.330
Always room for one more.

27:47.160 --> 27:50.084
I commend you, Madame
on your excellent appetite.

27:50.240 --> 27:52.083
(Montespan laughs)

27:52.240 --> 27:56.325
Sire, you hardly know me
or the scope of my needs.

27:59.400 --> 28:00.481
I know this.

28:02.280 --> 28:03.645
You're still hungry.

28:06.440 --> 28:07.965
How many have you had?

28:08.840 --> 28:10.126
I do not recall.

28:10.760 --> 28:14.082
In which case why would one more
make any difference?

28:15.800 --> 28:17.768
Hard to say without partaking.

28:18.480 --> 28:19.481
Why is that?

28:20.520 --> 28:23.524
Surely, after a certain time,
it's just a number.

28:26.640 --> 28:28.290
It depends on the number.

28:31.160 --> 28:32.161
(Laughs)

28:57.680 --> 28:59.489
(The Queen)
You had my message?

29:00.600 --> 29:04.571
I've prayed for your lost child
constantly: every day, your Majesty.

29:04.720 --> 29:07.883
You're kind to speak so.
Bring a chair.

29:11.240 --> 29:13.242
For the child inside you.

29:13.400 --> 29:14.765
(Sighs)

29:24.920 --> 29:28.083
(Marie-ThÃ©rÃ¨se)
'Tis warm. Take off your shawl.

29:44.720 --> 29:46.165
My words were not kind.

29:46.320 --> 29:49.722
I said them in a moment,
clouded by my own feelings.

29:49.880 --> 29:51.769
I would like us to be friends.

29:52.640 --> 29:55.086
Though I still resent
every stolen moment

29:55.240 --> 29:57.561
you have taken
from my husband and me.

29:57.720 --> 30:00.291
But because I sense
something in your soul.

30:01.560 --> 30:03.244
I can feel the pain you hold.

30:06.440 --> 30:07.487
(Louise) Yes.

30:11.400 --> 30:15.121
My concern is not as such for you.
You understand?

30:16.400 --> 30:18.641
The life inside you
can feel this pain.

30:20.280 --> 30:22.851
I will become a nun
when time permits.

30:23.000 --> 30:25.890
- Do you love the King?
- I love God.

30:26.440 --> 30:27.930
But it's not an answer.

30:29.560 --> 30:31.324
I also love the King

30:32.440 --> 30:34.363
But the price is too much.

30:34.720 --> 30:36.290
What have you done?

30:36.440 --> 30:38.408
Do you think God will forgive me?

30:53.680 --> 30:56.126
- Victory!
- Did you solve the problem?

30:56.920 --> 30:59.571
(Montcourt)
There are plenty asking questions.

30:59.720 --> 31:02.485
I would rather not provide them
with answers.

31:02.640 --> 31:04.290
And the King gains territory.

31:04.440 --> 31:07.603
Claims the lands in Spain
in kind for his unpaid dowry.

31:08.120 --> 31:11.283
Pretext naturally, but victory for him
is more than land.

31:11.760 --> 31:14.684
It's confidence and power.
He must be stopped.

31:15.360 --> 31:18.125
In a few days,
the roads will be ours again.

31:18.480 --> 31:21.484
- So you're ready to work?
- I'm at your service.

31:22.520 --> 31:27.162
Protocol doesn't permit us to own
a business. I run my affairs by proxy.

31:27.520 --> 31:30.251
Thirty companies
are under my control.

31:30.400 --> 31:34.803
My most trusted man has a brother
in a royal depot in Paris.

31:34.960 --> 31:37.850
He spoke of a shipment
making its way to Versailles.

31:38.000 --> 31:42.528
It'll be heavily guarded and
they'll fight to the end to defend it.

31:42.680 --> 31:46.446
You raised me from the dead,
my Lord, I'll lay down my life for you.

31:46.600 --> 31:47.647
Good.

31:47.800 --> 31:50.849
Because as I hear
this is a cargo worth dying for.

32:01.040 --> 32:02.405
I will speak to the King.

32:04.000 --> 32:06.810
(Fabien)
Perhaps your hearing is suspect.

32:07.200 --> 32:10.647
The King is not to be disturbed.
He's in private conference.

32:13.480 --> 32:14.480
With whom?

32:18.520 --> 32:22.206
(Emissary) The House of Hapsburg
has tried to remain indifferent

32:22.360 --> 32:26.081
to your war but the Spanish
lose patience and wish us to intervene.

32:26.240 --> 32:29.164
You have claim by inheritance.
Ours is by law.

32:29.320 --> 32:31.368
We need not fight each other.

32:31.520 --> 32:34.205
Though many on your side
might benefit from war.

32:34.360 --> 32:36.010
Circles are divided.

32:36.160 --> 32:38.925
But if our discussions
were to establish a policy.

32:39.080 --> 32:42.084
Your prince Hapsburg might yet find
his cardinal's hat.

32:42.520 --> 32:43.760
Indeed, Majesty.

32:45.040 --> 32:49.204
Let's move to a treaty between France
and the House of Hapsburg.

32:50.000 --> 32:52.446
To divide the territory
on the king's death.

32:52.760 --> 32:55.366
A healthy ruler is paramount
to state security.

32:56.280 --> 32:59.443
Your Majesty. Your face!

33:09.440 --> 33:12.808
Get a doctor. Quickly!
Did you not hear me, man?

33:18.320 --> 33:19.651
I will fetch Masson.

33:19.800 --> 33:22.485
Not that doctor. The other one.

33:26.680 --> 33:28.808
So, we are agreed?

33:30.600 --> 33:31.806
I believe so.

33:40.640 --> 33:42.210
No one must enter.

34:03.520 --> 34:04.885
(Bontemps) Come quickly.

34:05.040 --> 34:06.565
Not you. Her.

34:18.080 --> 34:19.320
Your father's mess.

34:20.800 --> 34:21.800
Fix it.

34:24.480 --> 34:25.686
Please.

34:30.520 --> 34:32.045
It'll have to be stitched.

34:32.760 --> 34:34.444
The hot needle and thread.

34:35.159 --> 34:36.241
It'll hurt.

34:37.880 --> 34:38.880
Good.

34:42.120 --> 34:43.485
You may go.

34:54.840 --> 34:58.083
(Louis) I will bring you glory.
I vow it.

35:00.200 --> 35:02.362
(Rohan) We're far inside the line.

35:02.520 --> 35:04.443
We're in great danger here.

35:04.600 --> 35:06.682
- I promised your brother.
- What?

35:07.000 --> 35:08.968
That I would ensure your safety.

35:17.880 --> 35:22.090
(sounds of battle, firing)

35:59.880 --> 36:01.723
What a surprise. You're here.

36:01.880 --> 36:05.282
I wanted to talk to you
away from the usual ears.

36:08.800 --> 36:11.280
What Chevalier did to poor AngÃ©lique

36:11.440 --> 36:13.329
He is unpardonable.

36:13.480 --> 36:16.689
He is being himself unfortunately.
Now I have a new lady.

36:17.400 --> 36:19.641
Ah, the new girl. Mlle Clermont.

36:19.800 --> 36:21.609
Sophie, she's pleasant enough.

36:21.760 --> 36:25.446
Well, I have a scheme
to bring revenge on the chevalier.

36:25.600 --> 36:29.161
- Might you consider it?
- No, thank you AthenaÃ¯s.

36:29.640 --> 36:31.085
Might I ask why?

36:33.360 --> 36:36.284
I already know what you want
but I can't help.

36:36.600 --> 36:38.921
I'm sure I don't know what you mean.

36:40.600 --> 36:42.967
Think awhile. You'll get there.

36:46.160 --> 36:47.605
I suppose I will.

36:51.520 --> 36:53.363
(Fabien) Take her to her family.

37:08.920 --> 37:12.288
- Where did you find her?
- In the woods near Chaville.

37:12.920 --> 37:15.730
- Where is she now?
- Buried with her family.

37:15.880 --> 37:20.090
- Buried, without a sermon?
- A full sermon might attract attention.

37:20.760 --> 37:22.125
And what would be wrong?

37:22.880 --> 37:25.406
When I hope,
you break my heart again.

37:26.640 --> 37:28.608
Why did you hide this from me?

37:30.200 --> 37:31.645
Because you've armed me.

37:32.400 --> 37:35.324
Not just with weapons but with choices.

37:36.000 --> 37:39.561
My choice was to protect the truth.
That Charlotte Parthenay

37:40.480 --> 37:42.847
didn't die with her family on the road.

37:43.440 --> 37:47.240
This knowledge gives us something
her killers don't possess.

37:47.400 --> 37:51.121
Certainty. Which means
they'll make a mistake.

37:53.960 --> 37:55.200
Did she suffer?

37:56.720 --> 37:58.006
A great deal.

37:59.920 --> 38:01.445
I hope it wasn't long.

38:03.440 --> 38:07.001
She was in pain
for a considerable period.

38:07.720 --> 38:10.200
You don't seek my approval at all,
do you?

38:12.440 --> 38:15.284
I seek only to protect your life.

38:20.960 --> 38:24.362
Your honesty is also a weapon,
Monsieur Marchal.

38:26.320 --> 38:27.890
If you say so, Sire.

38:30.680 --> 38:32.250
(gun shot)

38:34.680 --> 38:35.966
(shot, a man groans)

38:38.600 --> 38:39.840
(man groans)

38:41.760 --> 38:42.761
No, please!

38:43.160 --> 38:46.004
- It's your turn, Moncourt.
- No, please, no!

38:50.680 --> 38:52.762
- I know you.
- You used to know me.

38:57.880 --> 39:01.202
Nobles don't dig.
I have a better idea.

39:03.320 --> 39:04.367
(door opens)

39:07.480 --> 39:09.050
We are surrounded.

39:09.600 --> 39:12.968
By conspirators. By criticism.

39:14.440 --> 39:16.488
By wilderness and danger.

39:21.360 --> 39:24.443
Defence is over.
We must break siege and attack.

39:24.960 --> 39:27.247
- Arrange a force for the roads.
- It's done.

39:27.400 --> 39:29.880
Make their clothing uniform
and presence felt

39:30.040 --> 39:32.122
To deter and reassure
as in Paris.

39:32.400 --> 39:33.970
Purge the road and patrol.

39:34.120 --> 39:36.202
And contact every noble who defies.

39:36.360 --> 39:38.522
I wish to understand their concerns.

39:38.880 --> 39:41.247
And they shall be informed
of our intent.

39:42.360 --> 39:43.360
The King at war.

40:07.240 --> 40:08.366
Father!

40:09.240 --> 40:10.810
I'm making potage.

40:10.960 --> 40:14.123
Celery, potatoes, carrots, salt.
Very simple.

40:14.280 --> 40:15.884
Father please, let me.

40:17.520 --> 40:18.520
Sit.

40:19.440 --> 40:20.487
Rest.

40:21.120 --> 40:23.487
You've had a full day
at work after all.

40:24.880 --> 40:27.167
Say what you mean.

40:27.560 --> 40:30.643
- Do you mock me?
- I don't know what you're saying.

40:30.800 --> 40:32.245
Where have you been?

40:33.080 --> 40:35.731
I'm not at liberty to say.

40:37.080 --> 40:38.366
That says it all.

40:40.120 --> 40:44.205
My work is rushed.
Simple even. But my own daughter.

40:45.600 --> 40:48.410
Of course he would seek
to ruin my reputation.

40:48.560 --> 40:50.562
- Your reputation.
- In tatters now.

40:50.720 --> 40:53.803
Remains intact.
Father, you're jealous.

40:54.640 --> 40:56.005
I'm scared, child.

40:57.000 --> 40:58.365
Scared for you.

40:59.120 --> 41:01.009
Here's not a place to trust.

41:01.240 --> 41:04.642
This is a cold, venal, brutal
circle of lies.

41:05.120 --> 41:07.646
They may use me and cast me aside.

41:08.200 --> 41:12.444
But while there's breath in my lungs
they're not going do the same to you.

41:12.600 --> 41:16.002
The King has his favorites.
But he tires of them

41:17.120 --> 41:19.327
And we don't see them anymore.

41:23.200 --> 41:28.491
(heavy storm)

41:43.000 --> 41:44.525
Oh, Monsieur Fabien.

41:45.000 --> 41:48.482
- Madame, what are you doing here?
- I'm so scared.

41:50.120 --> 41:51.804
The war, the night. Would you

41:52.320 --> 41:53.845
take me to my apartment?

41:58.520 --> 42:01.000
The news must have come as a shock.

42:01.800 --> 42:04.371
- The news?
- Your friends.

42:05.640 --> 42:08.325
- What about my friends?
- The Parthenays.

42:08.760 --> 42:11.286
They lived close to your family
did they not?

42:11.600 --> 42:13.250
Known to me, yes.

42:14.160 --> 42:15.366
A tragedy.

42:15.920 --> 42:17.729
Can't bear to think of it.

42:18.880 --> 42:23.522
Perhaps we can walk awhile again
in the garden during the day.

42:24.240 --> 42:25.765
I'd like that very much.

42:43.000 --> 42:49.246
(priest snores. door opens)

42:51.680 --> 42:53.728
Bless me father for I have sinned.

42:54.640 --> 42:56.290
(Priest) What is your sin?

42:57.920 --> 43:00.685
(Louis)
The mortal sins of envy and wrath.

43:01.520 --> 43:05.081
Remember, Sire,
some state transgressions are necessary.

43:05.240 --> 43:08.244
- Whereas if committed by man.
- Do not address me so!

43:08.760 --> 43:12.560
I'm a man alone, burdened by sin
doing my penance under God.

43:15.000 --> 43:17.162
I sent my own brother to war.

43:17.600 --> 43:20.206
Now, how shall I repent?

43:20.360 --> 43:22.328
Acts of contrition vary widely.

43:23.160 --> 43:24.400
One may atone in kind

43:24.560 --> 43:28.042
by balancing virtues in their stead.

43:28.880 --> 43:31.884
The sin of envy for example
mirrors virtue

43:32.040 --> 43:34.771
of humanitas. Or kindness.

43:35.320 --> 43:38.881
The sin of wrath is mirrored
by the virtue of patience.

43:39.040 --> 43:41.327
We are at war
where wrath is stationed.

43:41.680 --> 43:43.762
And war is no place for kindness.

44:16.920 --> 44:18.126
(The King approaches)

44:21.440 --> 44:23.568
Bravo! The look is yours.

44:23.720 --> 44:26.610
- I think you're mistaken, Madame.
- You're upset.

44:27.240 --> 44:28.730
I cannot reach him.

44:30.160 --> 44:32.003
I feel like a sack of flour.

44:36.080 --> 44:38.128
- Can you help me?
- With what?

44:38.640 --> 44:40.324
I am boring and you are funny.

44:40.480 --> 44:42.528
Perhaps you can change his mood.

44:43.440 --> 44:45.090
Talk to him, let him laugh.

44:45.480 --> 44:48.563
If he's in good humor,
I might just have a chance.

44:49.160 --> 44:52.004
- Would you do that?
- I suppose I could try.

44:52.160 --> 44:58.805
(Crowd cheering, horses on the cobbles)

45:00.920 --> 45:03.685
- Do you miss England?
- I miss you.

45:05.720 --> 45:08.485
The summer of our lives has been
full of blossom.

45:09.080 --> 45:10.844
But the nights are drawing in.

45:11.480 --> 45:13.721
In the growing darkness
we must remember

45:13.880 --> 45:16.645
that life is more than love.

45:18.000 --> 45:20.128
And marriage more than duty.

45:34.600 --> 45:37.080
(Philippe) My plan is very simple.

45:37.480 --> 45:40.882
- Here, lead our line into this valley.
- Then they'd follow

45:41.040 --> 45:42.326
our retreat.

45:42.480 --> 45:46.246
Allowing our cavalry in from the east.
Closing the circle.

45:47.320 --> 45:49.641
- They'd have nowhere to go.
- The King!

45:56.440 --> 46:00.126
- Brother, wonderful news.
- Indeed, the war is over.

46:02.920 --> 46:05.446
Ceasefire negotiations
begin in Tournois.

46:05.880 --> 46:09.441
We've battled hard for this.
Many have died to attain it.

46:09.600 --> 46:11.728
We'll maintain our line but no more.

46:11.880 --> 46:15.168
In a day or two hostilities
will cease.

46:17.720 --> 46:18.881
For what?

46:20.520 --> 46:23.729
We can win brother.
Here. Today.

46:23.880 --> 46:25.325
The odds are not with us.

46:25.480 --> 46:27.209
We've lost too much to stop.

46:27.360 --> 46:28.725
Let's speak, brother.

46:36.360 --> 46:37.486
Alone.

46:44.200 --> 46:47.522
- I'm here to bring you home.
- And I came here to fight.

46:49.120 --> 46:51.088
This ceasefire, I was wondering.

46:51.240 --> 46:54.528
Will it just so happen
to be announced on your return?

46:54.680 --> 46:58.366
All hail, King Louis.
Who went to war and won the peace!

47:00.560 --> 47:03.040
Our spies say
there's a price on your head.

47:03.560 --> 47:06.689
Spain has mercenaries
to seek you out on the field.

47:06.840 --> 47:10.162
They wish to make an example,
to use you against me.

47:10.320 --> 47:13.244
- I'll not take the risk.
- This is the porridge.

47:16.680 --> 47:20.241
You remember don't you?
I can't remember where we were.

47:21.280 --> 47:25.729
You flicked some porridge
and I threw some back at you.

47:27.000 --> 47:28.286
Soon we were at it.

47:28.440 --> 47:31.444
You tipped the bowl over me
so I pissed on you.

47:31.600 --> 47:33.728
Soon we were pissing on one another.

47:33.880 --> 47:34.881
You started it!

47:35.800 --> 47:37.245
You flicked the porridge.

47:39.400 --> 47:40.731
But I got the blame!

47:43.840 --> 47:45.046
You pissed on me.

47:46.360 --> 47:48.442
But I pissed on the King!

47:49.840 --> 47:53.526
- Come with me!
- Without me those men may die.

47:53.680 --> 47:56.286
This will be the last battle
not your last act.

47:58.920 --> 48:02.811
On a field there are no kings.
No nobles, no peasants.

48:03.320 --> 48:05.368
Every man is equal.

48:05.520 --> 48:08.683
Tomorrow I'll be closer to the enemy
than to my brother.

48:11.320 --> 48:13.800
Henriette! Where is my wife!

48:15.240 --> 48:16.810
I envy your brotherhood.

48:16.960 --> 48:19.327
For me only solitude
which you never knew.

48:19.480 --> 48:22.245
Tomorrow I'll be with my brothers.

48:25.080 --> 48:27.526
They mean to seek you out
and kill you.

48:28.480 --> 48:29.480
Well then.

48:31.640 --> 48:33.005
I'll wear something fun

48:33.840 --> 48:35.604
or they won't know who I am.

48:40.560 --> 48:41.891
I missed you, darling.

49:28.520 --> 49:36.520
(shouting and sounds of battle)

49:37.305 --> 49:43.752
