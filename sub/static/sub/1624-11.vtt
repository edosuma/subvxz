WEBVTT

00:02.232 --> 00:04.421
Sandwich, burger.

00:05.963 --> 00:07.589
Why the big smile, Han?

00:07.591 --> 00:09.541
You going commando
under those corduroys?

00:09.543 --> 00:13.044
No, Max, I am happy today
because diner clientele

00:13.046 --> 00:15.223
has finally changed for the better.

00:15.599 --> 00:17.348
Look, two parties of cool hipsters

00:17.350 --> 00:20.270
are sitting at tables near wall.

00:20.637 --> 00:23.065
You think those are six hipsters?

00:23.231 --> 00:25.273
Okay, let's go over this one more time.

00:25.275 --> 00:27.569
Hipster or homeless pop quiz, ready?

00:27.844 --> 00:29.193
- Ready.
- Hipsters wear?

00:29.195 --> 00:30.196
Skinny jeans.

00:30.655 --> 00:32.780
- Homeless wear?
- Dirty jeans.

00:32.782 --> 00:34.618
- Hipsters listen to?
- Radiohead.

00:34.784 --> 00:38.038
- Homeless listen to?
- The voices in their head.

00:38.288 --> 00:40.791
- Hipsters have?
- Beard and a blog.

00:41.024 --> 00:43.335
- Homeless have?
- Beard and so much sadness.

00:44.763 --> 00:46.797
I see sadness, there and there.

00:46.963 --> 00:49.466
I'll handle this.

00:49.632 --> 00:51.866
I told you before, I don't
want you kind in here.

00:51.868 --> 00:53.637
Take a trendy hike.

00:53.803 --> 00:58.934
Better step it up.
The apple store closes at ten.

00:59.100 --> 01:00.936
Max, why did you kick out the hipsters?

01:01.102 --> 01:02.810
'Cause I could not be in the background

01:02.812 --> 01:05.013
of another Instagram photo.

01:07.000 --> 01:13.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:18.545 --> 01:19.854
Here's the last check, Earl.

01:19.856 --> 01:21.832
And, Max, they stiffed us on the tip

01:22.108 --> 01:23.307
but they forgot their camera.

01:23.309 --> 01:24.725
Oh, I'll give it to Oleg.

01:24.727 --> 01:27.829
He can take one of his special pictures.

01:27.831 --> 01:29.614
That way, when they come back to get it,

01:29.616 --> 01:31.800
everyone will have been stiffed.

01:32.318 --> 01:34.068
Well, good night, ladies.

01:34.510 --> 01:36.287
I gotta get home before the snow starts.

01:36.804 --> 01:38.772
It's not gonna snow,
Earl, it's 50 degrees.

01:39.181 --> 01:40.691
Oh, it's gonna snow, trust me.

01:40.693 --> 01:42.960
I couldn't tell when my
first wife was coming,

01:42.962 --> 01:45.981
but I can sure tell
when a storm is coming.

01:49.525 --> 01:51.252
All right, so what's the plan?

01:51.254 --> 01:52.753
What are we gonna do if it does snow?

01:52.755 --> 01:56.116
You're so white, I'm worried
we're gonna lose you.

01:56.426 --> 01:57.625
I love the snow.

01:57.627 --> 01:59.977
Opening my balcony doors
and watching it fall

01:59.979 --> 02:02.763
like fresh white linen and
then running across the street

02:02.765 --> 02:04.798
to the park to make snow angels.

02:05.333 --> 02:07.635
Yeah, that's snow when you're rich.

02:07.637 --> 02:09.470
The only snow angels
you'll see this year

02:09.472 --> 02:13.274
are the six crack addicts
frozen to our stoop.

02:13.276 --> 02:15.743
Oh, not to mention the
adorable frozen horse

02:15.745 --> 02:17.695
we have illegally
living in the backyard.

02:17.697 --> 02:19.030
Max, don't overreact.

02:19.032 --> 02:19.997
Chestnut's fine.

02:19.999 --> 02:21.115
It's not gonna snow for weeks.

02:21.117 --> 02:22.283
All right, have it your way.

02:22.285 --> 02:23.817
But I wouldn't want to
be the next tenants

02:23.819 --> 02:25.486
who have to figure out
why a pissed off horse

02:25.488 --> 02:28.489
is haunting a Brooklyn apartment.

02:29.023 --> 02:32.660
I was cold and she thought
she knew weather patterns.

02:34.346 --> 02:36.797
Oleg, take a picture of your
junk on this customer's camera.

02:36.799 --> 02:39.159
Done.

02:39.325 --> 02:40.452
Aren't you gonna ask why?

02:40.618 --> 02:42.553
No need.

02:47.694 --> 02:49.110
I just saw Oleg's...

02:49.669 --> 02:51.979
Yeah, that might have been my fault.

02:51.981 --> 02:55.950
Kind of a shock seeing
it for the first time.

02:56.425 --> 02:57.902
Max, I don't like you implying

02:57.904 --> 03:00.020
that I would ever be cruel to Chestnut.

03:00.022 --> 03:01.155
I'm not implying it.

03:01.157 --> 03:03.824
I'm saying it outright.

03:03.826 --> 03:04.976
It's winter.

03:05.361 --> 03:06.877
And it's not like I've not
been thinking about it.

03:06.879 --> 03:08.579
But Chestnut belongs in a special home.

03:09.146 --> 03:11.249
You belong in a special home.

03:11.251 --> 03:12.917
I've done some research,

03:12.919 --> 03:14.719
and I found a retreat
in the Grand Tetons

03:14.721 --> 03:16.754
where newly-divorced
women come to hug horses

03:16.756 --> 03:19.039
to help them gain back
their ability to trust.

03:19.573 --> 03:24.145
The only Grand Tetons
Chestnut trusts are mine.

03:24.662 --> 03:26.731
Lady, you gotta get a
reality check real quick

03:26.733 --> 03:28.149
'cause Earl thinks it's gonna snow.

03:28.151 --> 03:30.651
<i>Earl also thinks the theme from shaft</i>

03:30.653 --> 03:34.355
was stolen from a cassette
tape he sent out in 1975.

03:34.839 --> 03:37.108
Shut your mouth. That happened.

03:37.591 --> 03:39.577
Max, it's not gonna snow.

03:39.579 --> 03:40.778
I know snow.

03:40.780 --> 03:42.863
We owned a ski chalet
in Saas-Fee Switzerland

03:42.865 --> 03:44.749
and I think I know more than
anyone in this restaurant

03:44.751 --> 03:46.951
about living in cold climes.

03:51.840 --> 03:53.907
Snow is coming.

03:54.358 --> 03:57.011
Yo, Swiss miss, you wanna have a
conversation about cold climes

03:57.013 --> 03:58.429
with Snowleg over there?

03:58.904 --> 04:01.132
Oh, Max, I almost forgot.

04:01.134 --> 04:03.100
The camera.

04:03.102 --> 04:05.919
I think you'll be very pleased.

04:06.370 --> 04:08.939
I made a little video as well.

04:09.415 --> 04:11.258
Why are you wearing two coats?

04:11.260 --> 04:13.060
Same reason I wear two condoms.

04:13.062 --> 04:15.262
In case one breaks.

04:20.786 --> 04:22.987
What the?

04:26.708 --> 04:28.709
Well, good morning, world's
worst weather girl.

04:29.268 --> 04:33.447
I have never seen so much sunshine.

04:33.449 --> 04:34.715
You know what that means?

04:34.717 --> 04:36.634
<i>Earl wrote shaft.</i>

04:37.193 --> 04:39.696
Max, I know it snowed, you
don't have to tell me.

04:39.862 --> 04:42.139
I'm surrounded by so much white
stuff I'm like Al Pacino

04:42.141 --> 04:45.226
<i>in the last scene of Scarface.</i>

04:45.228 --> 04:46.560
What are you wearing?

04:47.078 --> 04:49.680
You look like a bag of
crazy garbage grew arms.

04:50.247 --> 04:52.767
It's the hefty 2011 winter collection.

04:52.769 --> 04:53.818
I gave Chestnut my coat.

04:53.820 --> 04:56.937
This is the only way to
keep the snow off me.

04:56.939 --> 04:59.106
Look at poor Chestnut.

04:59.108 --> 05:00.574
What is he wearing on his hooves?

05:00.576 --> 05:02.526
I cut up my Fendi cashmere leggings.

05:02.528 --> 05:03.977
I grabbed them when we
raided the town house.

05:03.979 --> 05:05.979
I thought ahead for me, but not for him.

05:06.555 --> 05:09.033
He is humiliated in
those ladies clothes.

05:09.035 --> 05:11.118
He looks like j. Edgar hoover.

05:11.120 --> 05:13.204
I've been out here
sweeping since 4:00 A.M.

05:13.206 --> 05:15.456
But it just keeps coming down.

05:15.458 --> 05:16.957
What is your problem, snow?

05:16.959 --> 05:19.794
I used to love you!

05:19.796 --> 05:21.879
Maybe we should ask your old doorman

05:21.881 --> 05:25.165
"insert generic Irish
name here" to come help.

05:25.167 --> 05:26.467
I know their names.

05:26.469 --> 05:29.186
Day James, night James and black James.

05:29.703 --> 05:32.223
So your plan is you're gonna
sweep the snow away till spring

05:32.225 --> 05:33.891
while the horse is
trapped under this tarp?

05:33.893 --> 05:36.060
Which I'm pretty sure was
covering the out of business

05:36.062 --> 05:37.678
Cuban restaurant down the street.

05:38.212 --> 05:40.064
They were out of business
and I left a note.

05:40.066 --> 05:42.650
What did it say? "I'm loco, gracias."

05:43.217 --> 05:45.953
No, it said, "Sorry I took
your roof, hang in there."

05:47.823 --> 05:49.573
Max, don't be so negative.

05:49.575 --> 05:52.126
Doesn't matter where it
came from, it's working.

05:52.128 --> 05:55.579
I just need to secure
this tarp a little.

05:55.581 --> 05:56.831
Stop, you were gonna climb on

05:56.833 --> 05:59.467
an icy chair in six inch
heels and break your neck

05:59.469 --> 06:01.051
and then I'm gonna be stuck
with a horse in leggings

06:01.053 --> 06:03.170
and you in a wheelchair with
a chopstick in your mouth

06:03.172 --> 06:06.366
tapping out, "I'm sorry, I
thought that would work."

06:06.676 --> 06:08.208
I learned to build when I volunteered

06:08.210 --> 06:10.094
with habitat for humanity.

06:10.096 --> 06:14.148
Looking back, they had so
much more than I have now.

06:14.150 --> 06:16.434
Okay.

06:16.436 --> 06:18.402
I gotta go to my babysitting job

06:18.404 --> 06:20.988
and when I get back, you
and I are gonna sit down

06:20.990 --> 06:22.773
and come up with a more realistic home

06:22.775 --> 06:23.858
for j. Edgar hoofer.

06:24.300 --> 06:25.526
Max, he lives here.

06:25.528 --> 06:27.194
And I'm telling you, this is working.

06:27.720 --> 06:31.231
What I'm doing is actually
kind of brilliant.

06:35.227 --> 06:37.955
Now I'm worried about
those houses you built.

06:44.012 --> 06:44.946
Hey, Peach.

06:45.112 --> 06:47.715
Max, I have the most incredible news.

06:48.240 --> 06:50.910
Lawyer finally found a
loophole in your prenup?

06:51.437 --> 06:53.504
I wish, no.

06:53.506 --> 06:54.522
I just got an email

06:54.524 --> 06:56.357
and I have made it to the final round

06:56.359 --> 07:00.093
<i>of casting for Real
Housewives of Tribeca.</i>

07:00.586 --> 07:02.229
<i>Real Housewives of Tribeca?</i>

07:02.231 --> 07:03.764
They're doing neighborhoods now?

07:03.766 --> 07:07.093
<i>What's next, Real Housewives
of from here to there?</i>

07:07.259 --> 07:09.286
The producers are on their way
over and I want everything

07:09.288 --> 07:12.456
to be perfect when they
see Brad and Angelina.

07:12.458 --> 07:14.775
Uh, Peach, are you aware
that your children

07:14.777 --> 07:18.829
are being eaten by clothing?

07:19.313 --> 07:21.465
The snowsuits are Burberry.

07:21.467 --> 07:23.634
And the padding hides
Angelina's weight problem.

07:23.636 --> 07:25.636
Okay, you have to stop saying that.

07:25.638 --> 07:27.221
She doesn't have a weight problem.

07:27.738 --> 07:30.174
She's gained 25 pounds in one year.

07:32.143 --> 07:36.647
Yeah, 'cause she started at zero.

07:36.649 --> 07:39.466
Max, we all have to look
our best, 'cause ready?

07:39.468 --> 07:43.437
The last spot in the show is
between me and Misty Mastbaum.

07:43.439 --> 07:45.022
I thought she was your bestie.

07:45.548 --> 07:49.276
She is, but my bestie's a bitchy.

07:49.278 --> 07:50.911
She's crazy competitive.

07:51.428 --> 07:53.531
As soon as we were
approached about the show,

07:53.533 --> 07:57.001
she adopted a three-legged
corgi and named it Mr. Pickle.

07:57.476 --> 07:59.820
That's crazy bitchy.

08:00.312 --> 08:02.706
So now, I'm looking up
handicapped animals

08:02.708 --> 08:04.609
to impress the producers.

08:05.177 --> 08:07.344
Oh, you want a handicapped animal?

08:07.346 --> 08:09.463
I got your handicapped animal.

08:09.947 --> 08:14.468
I know a homeless horse with
gender identity issues.

08:14.952 --> 08:18.055
I was thinking something
cute, but damaged.

08:18.057 --> 08:20.125
Like a one-eyed French bulldog.

08:20.443 --> 08:24.511
What if I told you that this
horse was a celebrity horse?

08:24.513 --> 08:26.280
Tell me more.

08:26.282 --> 08:27.898
My friend, Caroline Channing...

08:28.299 --> 08:30.784
How do you know Caroline Channing?

08:30.786 --> 08:33.236
She's my AA sponsor.

08:33.721 --> 08:36.472
Makes sense.

08:36.475 --> 08:37.308
Go on.

08:37.710 --> 08:41.712
Anyway, she has this cute,
but crazy damaged horse

08:41.714 --> 08:43.330
and since her life flipped upside down,

08:43.332 --> 08:44.748
he needs a good home.

08:45.274 --> 08:47.251
Well, I'd have to meet Caroline first.

08:48.110 --> 08:50.554
Bring her by on Saturday.

08:51.071 --> 08:53.924
Max, what an amazing idea.

08:53.926 --> 08:58.178
Misty is literally going to die.

08:58.704 --> 09:01.765
I am so thrilled you
have a drinking problem.

09:11.081 --> 09:13.415
Did you have to put him in my bedroom?

09:13.417 --> 09:14.849
It was the easiest room to horse proof.

09:14.851 --> 09:18.336
You have so little of worth.

09:18.338 --> 09:19.704
You can stop googling. I already found

09:19.706 --> 09:21.239
a perfectly good place to put him.

09:21.602 --> 09:24.606
You're not still suggesting I
give Chestnut to Peach Landis?

09:25.178 --> 09:28.413
Max, look at me. Look at me in the eyes.

09:28.415 --> 09:30.265
Are you high?

09:30.652 --> 09:32.434
No, I couldn't find my bedroom stash

09:32.436 --> 09:34.102
since you moved everything around.

09:34.104 --> 09:35.920
Chestnut needs a home with affection

09:35.922 --> 09:37.689
and Peach won't even hug her children.

09:37.691 --> 09:38.828
She pays you to do that.

09:38.994 --> 09:40.525
That's why it's perfect.

09:40.527 --> 09:41.977
She'll pay for the fancy stable

09:41.979 --> 09:44.396
and we'll go and hug Chestnut
for her whenever we want.

09:44.398 --> 09:46.169
You just need to go
meet her and it's done.

09:46.335 --> 09:47.899
I have the DNA of a rich girl,

09:47.901 --> 09:50.035
even though I'm lying in
bed with you in a tenement

09:50.037 --> 09:52.370
and I bought my dinner
tonight with dimes.

09:52.372 --> 09:54.239
Chestnut and I are old money.

09:54.241 --> 09:55.740
And old money doesn't
parade itself around

09:55.742 --> 09:57.909
in front of cameras and
beg for attention.

09:57.911 --> 09:59.544
Hey, you're not the only
one with old money.

09:59.546 --> 10:00.745
I've had a dollar in my jeans

10:00.747 --> 10:02.998
I've been carrying
around for three weeks.

10:03.000 --> 10:04.332
You're meeting Peach Saturday,

10:04.334 --> 10:05.897
and we're saying good-bye to the horse.

10:06.063 --> 10:08.553
Why is getting rid of
Chestnut so easy for you?

10:08.899 --> 10:10.922
Didn't you ever have a pet as a child?

10:11.235 --> 10:12.590
Yes, I had a puppy.

10:12.592 --> 10:14.125
And after a week of living with my mom,

10:14.127 --> 10:17.628
he pulled the car over and put
us out on the side of the road.

10:17.950 --> 10:19.035
She got rid of it?

10:19.201 --> 10:21.149
Look, pets are not my thing, okay?

10:21.151 --> 10:22.800
I already have something
needy and Fluffy

10:22.802 --> 10:24.686
that'll die if I don't
take care of it... you.

10:27.107 --> 10:29.074
Go, it's your turn to go check on him.

10:29.076 --> 10:31.743
No, I went the last time and
caught him eating my bra.

10:32.089 --> 10:34.145
Don't exaggerate.
He only ate half of it.

10:34.147 --> 10:36.531
Oh, I'm sorry, you're right,
I should be more positive.

10:36.533 --> 10:41.419
One of my cups is half full.

10:42.839 --> 10:45.006
What's going on in there?

10:45.008 --> 10:46.291
I don't suppose there's any way

10:46.293 --> 10:50.528
you took a giant dump on your dresser?

10:50.530 --> 10:52.497
You can't blame Chestnut.
He's probably nervous.

10:52.499 --> 10:53.715
After wearing your leggings,

10:53.717 --> 10:56.935
<i>he's getting ready for
his fame audition.</i>

10:57.322 --> 11:01.973
He's a maniac, maniac on all fours.

11:01.975 --> 11:03.475
Oh, Max, here's something.

11:03.477 --> 11:05.643
The Ivy bridge riding
stables in Brooklyn.

11:05.645 --> 11:07.445
Only five Miles away.

11:07.447 --> 11:09.030
It says on their website
that their horses

11:09.032 --> 11:10.732
are featured in commercials and films!

11:11.211 --> 11:15.853
<i>Can you say Chestnut, star
of the war horse sequel?</i>

11:15.855 --> 11:18.323
Did you take the weed
from my bedside table?

11:18.325 --> 11:19.407
Look at me.

11:19.409 --> 11:21.409
Look at me in the eyes.

11:21.411 --> 11:22.932
Are you high?

11:23.513 --> 11:26.748
Honestly... a little.

11:27.102 --> 11:28.533
Close that and go to sleep.

11:28.535 --> 11:30.552
No, I'm still reading.

11:30.554 --> 11:33.471
Oh look at that, I just pulled
down your browser history.

11:33.473 --> 11:34.705
Interesting list.

11:34.707 --> 11:35.873
Kitten plays a keyboard,

11:35.875 --> 11:38.543
kitten sneezes and farts
at the same time?

11:38.545 --> 11:39.782
Give me that, that's private.

11:39.948 --> 11:41.813
Kitten folds a t-shirt!

11:41.815 --> 11:43.481
Oh, kitten rings a doorbell.

11:43.869 --> 11:45.850
I thought you said you
weren't into pets.

11:45.852 --> 11:46.985
I'm not!

11:46.987 --> 11:50.321
It's a kitten ringing a doorbell!

11:50.323 --> 11:53.942
He's trying to get in like people.

11:54.338 --> 11:56.561
You have a secret soft spot for animals.

11:56.965 --> 11:59.414
No, I'm just into freaky kittens.

11:59.416 --> 12:01.116
There's one who puts on a snakeskin suit

12:01.118 --> 12:03.535
and goes on a business trip.

12:03.537 --> 12:05.754
That's not soft. That is freaky.

12:06.099 --> 12:09.073
Fine, you're telling me to get a
reality check about Chestnut.

12:09.075 --> 12:10.625
But you need one too.

12:10.627 --> 12:13.578
You're gonna miss him when he's gone.

12:13.580 --> 12:14.879
Max, are you listening?

12:18.821 --> 12:20.051
Max, don't worry.

12:20.053 --> 12:21.586
I know it's all gonna work out perfectly

12:21.588 --> 12:22.754
at the stables tomorrow.

12:22.756 --> 12:23.705
I'm not worried.

12:35.767 --> 12:37.285
The man's not here yet.

12:37.287 --> 12:39.404
Damn it, turn us around Max,
we have to enter again.

12:39.716 --> 12:41.239
This is the third time.

12:41.241 --> 12:43.374
Max, come on, we borrowed
these coats from Oleg

12:43.376 --> 12:45.126
to make a dramatic star entrance.

12:45.128 --> 12:46.327
If you want me to fake it again,

12:46.329 --> 12:48.746
you have to buy me dinner
and call me pretty.

12:49.101 --> 12:50.781
Fine, then help me down quickly.

12:51.186 --> 12:55.053
I don't wanna be mid-dismount
when the stable guy walks in.

12:58.224 --> 12:59.841
God, ugh.

12:59.843 --> 13:02.227
You just sat on my face.

13:02.229 --> 13:06.097
Like I haven't done enough for you.

13:06.099 --> 13:07.482
Oh, hello, are you Tony?

13:07.484 --> 13:08.799
Last time I checked.

13:09.121 --> 13:10.485
Oh, jeez.

13:10.487 --> 13:12.470
I'm Caroline Channing.
We spoke on the phone.

13:12.791 --> 13:14.656
And this is Chestnut.

13:14.658 --> 13:15.740
Max, step back.

13:15.742 --> 13:17.325
Oh, great. I'll just be over here

13:17.327 --> 13:19.027
like the awkward father
in the background

13:19.029 --> 13:20.829
<i>on Toddlers and Tiaras.</i>

13:21.174 --> 13:22.747
Well, here he is.

13:22.749 --> 13:24.982
And as we discussed, Chestnut
is a champion jumper

13:25.304 --> 13:26.817
his dressage is impeccable,

13:26.819 --> 13:28.808
he's ribboned three times
at the Hampton Classic,

13:28.974 --> 13:31.122
and he comes from a
historically elite line

13:31.124 --> 13:32.645
of distinguished show horses.

13:32.811 --> 13:35.159
And he pees like a civil
rights fire hose.

13:35.480 --> 13:37.128
Max, step further back.

13:37.130 --> 13:38.496
Come on, let's cut to the chase.

13:38.498 --> 13:42.267
He's nice, brown, he
looks sick in leggings,

13:42.269 --> 13:44.686
and he's free, so take him or leave him.

13:45.032 --> 13:46.521
When'd you say he was a jumper?

13:46.867 --> 13:48.839
From 2005 to 2010.

13:48.841 --> 13:50.508
He was in a class by himself.

13:50.871 --> 13:52.443
Well, maybe he was a jumper,

13:52.445 --> 13:54.195
but he isn't anymore.

13:54.499 --> 13:55.168
What?

13:55.334 --> 13:56.586
Well, he's a little out of shape.

13:56.752 --> 13:58.783
Well, you have a gut.

13:59.129 --> 14:01.402
Whoa! I'm just saying
he's seen better days.

14:01.404 --> 14:03.571
I'm just saying your hair
is falling out in fistfuls.

14:03.967 --> 14:05.523
- Whoa!
- Okay, okay.

14:05.525 --> 14:07.625
Let's not get personal,
we all want this to work.

14:07.627 --> 14:08.681
He's the one who's getting personal

14:08.847 --> 14:10.308
going after Chestnut like that.

14:10.474 --> 14:11.913
Okay, you tell me,

14:11.915 --> 14:13.561
when's the last time he's exercised?

14:13.727 --> 14:15.383
When's the last time you exercised?

14:15.729 --> 14:18.336
Wow, show business is rough.

14:18.649 --> 14:20.004
All right, it's Tony, right?

14:20.317 --> 14:21.472
Last time I checked.

14:21.474 --> 14:23.391
All right, Tony, you'll
have to forgive her.

14:23.393 --> 14:25.977
She really loves him and
wants this to work out.

14:26.365 --> 14:28.846
Bottom line is, even a
free horse isn't free.

14:28.848 --> 14:31.048
I still have to feed him
and take care of him

14:31.050 --> 14:34.218
and truth be told, this horse
isn't gonna make me a penny.

14:34.220 --> 14:37.221
If my film guy comes in here,
he's gonna pick that beauty

14:37.223 --> 14:39.190
over this one.

14:39.503 --> 14:41.005
Oh.

14:41.171 --> 14:43.778
So it's not gonna work out, girls.

14:43.780 --> 14:46.948
All right, well, we got
other offers, fatty.

14:46.950 --> 14:49.167
Come on, let's go.

14:50.847 --> 14:53.421
You know, maybe next time
before you let someone

14:53.423 --> 14:56.791
ride five Miles across
Brooklyn in a toxic, Russian,

14:56.793 --> 14:58.189
cologne-soaked rent-a-fur,

14:58.355 --> 15:00.295
you should be clear
that the film business,

15:00.297 --> 15:03.715
even for horses, is ageist and elitist.

15:03.717 --> 15:05.767
And, yes, we may have seen better days,

15:05.769 --> 15:08.386
but with hard work, determination
and a little luck,

15:08.388 --> 15:10.087
one day we'll be back on top.

15:10.089 --> 15:14.025
Yeah, and I'm not impressed by
your big star pony over there.

15:14.027 --> 15:15.426
He's just standing still.

15:15.428 --> 15:16.444
You wanna impress me?

15:16.446 --> 15:20.949
Have him meow and ring the doorbell.

15:20.951 --> 15:22.817
Don't take it personally, Chestnut.

15:22.819 --> 15:25.086
Those horses have had work done.

15:28.610 --> 15:29.160
+

15:32.976 --> 15:35.945
maybe you wanna take the cinch
sack off before you meet Peach.

15:35.947 --> 15:38.020
No it's snowing again and
I'm a penniless beggar.

15:38.316 --> 15:39.665
I should look like one.

15:39.667 --> 15:41.683
Besides, she'll probably
think it's a look.

15:41.685 --> 15:43.068
All right, I know this one on one

15:43.070 --> 15:44.520
with Peach isn't your ideal scenario,

15:44.522 --> 15:45.854
but it's what's best for Chestnut

15:45.856 --> 15:47.613
so man up and face reality.

15:47.779 --> 15:50.324
You're right.

15:51.379 --> 15:55.288
And my friend, Caroline Channing...

15:55.454 --> 15:56.372
What is it?

15:56.538 --> 15:58.083
You might be ready to face reality,

15:58.085 --> 16:00.669
but are you ready to face reality TV?

16:00.671 --> 16:02.137
The place is crawling with Peach clones

16:02.139 --> 16:03.672
and TV cameras ready to meet you.

16:03.674 --> 16:04.755
She totally set us up.

16:04.921 --> 16:06.425
Are you kidding me?

16:06.427 --> 16:09.044
Fabulous, this is awesome, just awesome.

16:09.046 --> 16:10.712
She's using the Caroline
Channing freak show

16:10.714 --> 16:12.305
to get herself on another freak show.

16:12.471 --> 16:14.223
All right, you're right, let's
go, you don't have to do this.

16:14.389 --> 16:16.986
No, if I made Chestnut parade around

16:16.988 --> 16:18.571
and be humiliated in public,

16:18.573 --> 16:20.889
then I have to be
willing to do the same.

16:20.891 --> 16:24.893
Here, hold my coat.

16:24.895 --> 16:26.527
You always have those with you?

16:26.693 --> 16:30.740
Yes, I'm from Manhattan.

16:30.906 --> 16:33.034
- Okay, thank me for coming.
- What?

16:33.200 --> 16:35.087
Thank me for coming, that's
what people did all the time

16:35.089 --> 16:37.172
when I was a billionaire.

16:37.174 --> 16:38.674
Thank you for coming.

16:38.676 --> 16:42.335
No, thank you for inviting me.

16:42.501 --> 16:44.879
Wow, that's so cool.

16:45.045 --> 16:48.300
Don't freak out.

16:48.302 --> 16:51.420
I'm about to get my rich on.

16:51.422 --> 16:53.012
So when we go in there
I'll introduce you?

16:53.178 --> 16:54.106
Oh, you don't have to.

16:54.108 --> 16:55.107
Rich people always pretend

16:55.109 --> 16:56.225
to know each other.

16:56.227 --> 16:57.560
Now open that door,

16:57.562 --> 16:59.645
and let's get my baby a home.

17:03.150 --> 17:04.567
Peach.

17:04.569 --> 17:07.703
I wanna thank you for inviting
me into your beautiful home

17:07.704 --> 17:09.622
and showing me such kindness

17:09.624 --> 17:13.199
during this very difficult,
difficult time.

17:13.365 --> 17:16.662
Ladies, I would like you all to meet

17:16.664 --> 17:19.798
my dear friend, Caroline Channing.

17:19.800 --> 17:23.952
Who, in light of her recent
very difficult, difficult

17:23.954 --> 17:29.808
financial troubles, has asked me
to adopt her damaged pet horse

17:29.810 --> 17:34.563
who was brought to my attention
by my alcoholic servant, Max.

17:35.632 --> 17:38.891
Right over there.

17:41.021 --> 17:42.521
Caroline,

17:42.523 --> 17:43.938
thank you for coming.

17:44.104 --> 17:47.316
No, thank you for inviting me.

17:47.482 --> 17:49.194
I'm proud of you.

17:49.196 --> 17:51.280
No, I'm proud of you.

17:51.282 --> 17:54.533
I just got the chills again.

17:58.371 --> 17:59.755
Oh, Max, look at him.

17:59.757 --> 18:00.955
He's smiling.

18:01.342 --> 18:03.082
He likes this place.

18:03.248 --> 18:06.293
Yeah, it's almost worth you
being humiliated on reality TV.

18:06.459 --> 18:07.829
Oh, I'll never be on that show.

18:07.831 --> 18:09.338
I didn't sign the release.

18:09.504 --> 18:10.466
What?

18:10.468 --> 18:13.636
Old money don't sign.

18:13.638 --> 18:15.554
You're gonna love it here, huh?

18:15.556 --> 18:17.222
Aren't you gonna love it here?

18:17.224 --> 18:19.391
A nice big stable.

18:19.393 --> 18:22.811
Maybe I will, maybe I won't.

18:22.813 --> 18:26.899
Maybe I should come home and
live with my best friend, Max.

18:26.901 --> 18:28.517
What about Caroline?

18:28.940 --> 18:31.277
She can sleep under the tarp.

18:31.739 --> 18:34.655
So I guess you found your weed.

18:35.209 --> 18:37.526
No, this is just something we
do when we're alone together.

18:37.528 --> 18:39.745
It's kind of our thing.

18:39.747 --> 18:41.954
You really love Chestnut, don't you?

18:42.120 --> 18:43.465
He's all right.

18:43.467 --> 18:46.168
He's no kitten.

18:46.170 --> 18:51.056
Okay, I'll see you soon, Chestnut.

18:51.058 --> 18:53.090
You want a minute alone?

18:53.256 --> 18:56.378
I'll be out front.

18:59.683 --> 19:02.234
Hey.

19:02.236 --> 19:04.353
This is probably gonna
seem ridiculous to you

19:04.355 --> 19:06.522
because you're a horse
and I'm just some lady

19:06.524 --> 19:10.608
that's been slipping you carrots
for the last few months, but...

19:10.911 --> 19:13.779
I really got attached to you.

19:13.781 --> 19:17.698
This is way more than most
horses get out of me.

19:17.864 --> 19:21.954
I wasn't even this upset when
they discontinued tan m&ms.

19:23.790 --> 19:26.759
I, um...

19:26.761 --> 19:29.094
I really haven't had much
go right for me in my life,

19:29.096 --> 19:32.181
and I'm pretty sure things are
gonna keep getting worse but,

19:32.183 --> 19:35.050
you were a good thing.

19:35.052 --> 19:36.468
And when everything sucked,

19:36.470 --> 19:39.638
you were the best thing we had going.

19:39.640 --> 19:42.223
And you're fuzzy too.

19:42.389 --> 19:44.643
You're so fuzzy, and no one can argue

19:44.645 --> 19:48.230
that touching a warm, fuzzy
thing isn't straight up lovely.

19:48.232 --> 19:52.934
So, thank you for everything
you did for us, but...

19:52.936 --> 19:55.120
Especially for being fuzzy.

20:00.076 --> 20:01.408
Max, are you okay?

20:01.574 --> 20:03.911
Yeah, I'm fine, I'll always be fine.

20:04.077 --> 20:04.912
Are you crying?

20:05.078 --> 20:06.632
Yeah, I'm crying,

20:06.634 --> 20:09.951
'cause I wish I could live here.

20:14.457 --> 20:16.091
Don't worry, we'll come visit,

20:16.093 --> 20:19.061
and we'll find a way to bring
him home in the spring.

20:19.063 --> 20:21.480
Come on. I have a pocket full of dimes.

20:21.482 --> 20:24.099
Let's go get some
convenience store taquitos

20:24.101 --> 20:26.485
and wash 'em down with blue
raspberry wine coolers.

20:26.487 --> 20:27.986
They're on sale at the bodega.

20:27.988 --> 20:30.354
Two four packs for five dollars.

20:30.520 --> 20:36.245
You know exactly what to say
to cheer a broke sista up.

20:36.247 --> 20:37.663
And when we get home, I found a video

20:37.665 --> 20:40.315
of a kitten singing Bruno Mars.

20:41.305 --> 20:47.379
