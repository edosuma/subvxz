00:10.468 --> 00:12.262
<i>Now the story</i>
<i>of a wealthy family</i>

00:12.345 --> 00:15.473
<i>who lost everything,
and the one son who had no choice</i>

00:15.557 --> 00:17.142
<i>but to keep them all together.</i>

00:23.148 --> 00:24.858
<i>It's...</i>

00:29.446 --> 00:32.156
<i>Michael Bluth was visiting</i>
<i>the family business,</i>

00:32.240 --> 00:34.617
<i>hoping to find Lucille Austero,</i>

00:34.701 --> 00:36.745
<i>who was now a majority stakeholder,</i>

00:37.120 --> 00:38.329
<i>to thank the woman...</i>

00:38.413 --> 00:40.290
- They closed the company.
<i>- ...for forgiving his debt.</i>

00:40.373 --> 00:42.333
- Don't mind me, I work downstairs.
- Hi.

00:42.417 --> 00:44.044
Doing a little lunch looting.

00:44.127 --> 00:47.088
- You?
- It was my family's company.

00:47.172 --> 00:48.131
I'm Michael Bluth.

00:48.214 --> 00:50.842
Hey.
You guys put me in my first house.

00:51.259 --> 00:54.262
Oh, yeah,
a lot of people's first house was a Bluth.

00:54.345 --> 00:57.140
No, no, I was part of that
Cornballer class action suit.

00:57.223 --> 00:58.308
- I see.
- Yeah,

00:58.391 --> 01:01.227
I made enough to put a down payment
on a Sitwell.

01:01.311 --> 01:04.938
Well, we've put a lot of people
in Sitwells, too.

01:09.486 --> 01:11.863
Uh... oh, God, well, you caught us.

01:11.946 --> 01:14.407
Didn't think anybody would be getting on
while we were getting off.

01:14.491 --> 01:16.201
What did you do to the Bluth Company?

01:16.284 --> 01:17.952
You've been president two weeks.

01:18.036 --> 01:20.205
- Took us to the next level.
- An iPhone 5 charger!

01:20.288 --> 01:21.331
Fourth floor.

01:22.290 --> 01:25.126
<i>Even the landlord was surprised</i>
<i>by the move.</i>

01:25.210 --> 01:26.419
Not only would you have to pay

01:26.503 --> 01:29.672
a penalty to get out of your old lease,
but the rent is double.

01:30.090 --> 01:31.800
Just to see the roof of a Rite Aid?

01:31.883 --> 01:35.053
<i>Which was the first that G.O.B.</i>
<i>had heard of the view.</i>

01:35.678 --> 01:36.930
I'll take it.

01:37.806 --> 01:39.224
Okay, okay. Okay.

01:39.307 --> 01:40.308
Ding.

01:41.351 --> 01:42.644
So?

01:42.727 --> 01:44.062
What do you think?

01:44.145 --> 01:46.356
It used to be a 2 Hour Teeth,
the whole place.

01:46.439 --> 01:48.233
Yeah, I remember the screams.

01:48.316 --> 01:50.735
I guess it was the 90 Minute Tooth guys
across the street

01:50.819 --> 01:52.946
that put the 2 Hour guys out of business.

01:53.113 --> 01:55.198
I did see that the old Blockbuster
is becoming

01:55.281 --> 01:58.785
an "Hour Mouth," so those guys
gotta be shitting themselves.

01:58.868 --> 02:01.204
Why did you move the business?
This is exactly the same.

02:01.746 --> 02:04.541
Says the guy who hasn't seen
the roof of the Rite Aid yet.

02:06.042 --> 02:07.502
Where's the nitrous?

02:07.585 --> 02:10.044
This will not be used
as the conference room?

02:10.419 --> 02:12.841
Uh, no. I had to kind of...
I had to move it,

02:12.924 --> 02:15.009
just, uh, for a couple reasons, actually.

02:15.093 --> 02:17.053
A, I wanted a bigger office.

02:19.973 --> 02:21.933
- That feels likeÂ the heart of it.
- Yeah, it is,

02:22.016 --> 02:23.017
- but, uh... Hey.
- Sure.

02:23.101 --> 02:24.310
Check out that view.

02:24.394 --> 02:26.980
Boy, what's a bike tire doing
on the roof of the Rite Aid?

02:27.272 --> 02:29.858
Yeah, that's the $14,000 a month question,
isn't it?

02:29.941 --> 02:32.485
When they said you were the president
of the Bluth Company,

02:32.569 --> 02:34.154
I assumed it was in name only.

02:34.237 --> 02:36.739
That they hired you to actually work
seems wrong.

02:37.073 --> 02:39.784
Do you even know what a mortgage is?

02:39.868 --> 02:41.953
No, he doesn't. He doesn't know anything.

02:42.495 --> 02:43.329
You do, though.

02:43.413 --> 02:45.415
You're the smart Bluth,
I can see it in your eyes.

02:45.874 --> 02:47.000
You read, don't you?

02:47.667 --> 02:50.044
Adhir is a holdover
from the Austero Company.

02:50.128 --> 02:51.671
He's our compliant officer.

02:51.754 --> 02:53.631
Or as I like to call him, Chief Worrywart.

02:53.715 --> 02:55.842
It's "compliance officer."

02:55.925 --> 02:59.262
Uh, hey, uh, so you worked
for the Austero Company?

02:59.345 --> 03:01.014
Uh, they forgave a big debt of mine.

03:01.097 --> 03:03.474
How would I get ahold
of Lucille Austero?

03:08.897 --> 03:11.357
- No one knows, I'm afraid.
- Okay.

03:11.441 --> 03:13.276
That's it,
go to your office, Adhir.

03:13.985 --> 03:18.072
He's the chief compliant officer,
so he has to do whatever I comply.

03:18.156 --> 03:20.074
I'm assuming that's

03:20.158 --> 03:21.492
where the conference table went.

03:21.576 --> 03:23.286
It's probably too big
for that room,

03:23.369 --> 03:26.206
and I would get it out,
but I can't quite remember

03:26.289 --> 03:27.749
how I got it in there.

03:27.832 --> 03:30.001
Like you, I'm about to go underwater,
but before I go,

03:30.084 --> 03:32.503
I'd like to give you some advice:
you're not good at this.

03:32.587 --> 03:34.923
Yeah. I know. But it's important to Dad.

03:35.006 --> 03:36.591
Want to know the thanks I'm getting?

03:36.674 --> 03:38.968
Dad is giving a trophy to Lindsay, not me,

03:39.052 --> 03:41.512
for the family of the year
ceremony tonight.

03:41.596 --> 03:42.722
Hm. Great, well,

03:42.805 --> 03:46.142
Dad didn't get a trophy for doing
what you're doing, and he actually did it.

03:46.226 --> 03:48.937
Well, that's not the worst way
to make Dad love me.

03:49.020 --> 03:54.400
I will get a trophy
for Dad, for... something.

03:54.484 --> 03:55.985
- Mm.
- Figure that out later.

03:56.069 --> 03:58.071
Dad's never gonna give you
what you're looking for.

03:58.154 --> 04:00.198
And, uh,
maybe that's how it should be.

04:00.281 --> 04:02.659
Maybe when sons grow up,
they're not supposed to be too close

04:02.742 --> 04:03.868
to their fathers.

04:03.952 --> 04:06.663
And maybe the best thing
a father can do for his son

04:06.746 --> 04:09.290
is disappear for a while
and let him figure out

04:09.374 --> 04:11.042
what kind of man
he wants to be on his own.

04:11.125 --> 04:12.710
At least, that's what I've tried to do.

04:14.212 --> 04:16.880
Then why did you move
into your son's dorm room?

04:17.589 --> 04:19.591
That was a year, okay?

04:19.676 --> 04:22.595
And not even a full year,
because I got there at Thanksgiving.

04:23.137 --> 04:25.265
Okay, well, goodbye forever, G.O.B.

04:25.348 --> 04:26.724
I'll be seeing you tonight.

04:27.809 --> 04:32.105
<i>Michael returned to the model home</i>
<i>to get his scuba equipment.</i>

04:32.188 --> 04:34.274
<i>But before he left town,
he thought he'd take</i>

04:34.357 --> 04:37.610
<i>one last look
at his son's childhood bedroom.</i>

04:38.861 --> 04:40.196
Uh... George Michael?

04:41.739 --> 04:44.242
Father.
It's me, George Michael.

04:44.325 --> 04:45.326
Think fast.

04:46.286 --> 04:47.245
Tobias.

04:47.996 --> 04:51.874
Michael.
Yes, well, this is embarrassing.

04:51.958 --> 04:54.711
Not only are you finding me
in your son's pants,

04:54.794 --> 04:57.964
but you're also finding out
how the sausage is made.

04:59.299 --> 05:00.842
I don't understand a thing you said.

05:00.925 --> 05:04.304
Well, I was doing some character work
for, um,

05:05.680 --> 05:07.515
uh...

05:07.598 --> 05:09.434
I'm doing a little character work
to prepare

05:09.517 --> 05:11.227
for the awards ceremony...

05:11.311 --> 05:12.270
How did...

05:12.687 --> 05:15.606
Why do they only have one...?

05:15.690 --> 05:17.150
Yes... oh! Uhp!

05:17.233 --> 05:18.651
- Okay, back...
- You all right?

05:18.735 --> 05:20.194
Oh! Um...

05:20.278 --> 05:21.446
There you go.

05:21.529 --> 05:23.072
- Just an acting exercise.
- Sure.

05:23.156 --> 05:24.741
You're supposed to be George Michael now?

05:24.824 --> 05:28.494
Oh, well, it's a character role,
really, and let's face it.

05:28.911 --> 05:30.913
No one was buying me as a straight man.

05:30.997 --> 05:32.540
It was a little off-brand.

05:32.623 --> 05:34.334
I'm just trying to find

05:34.417 --> 05:37.003
my place in the Bluth family...

05:37.211 --> 05:39.047
...now that, uh...

05:40.548 --> 05:43.051
Lucille's almost done with me
as her therapist

05:43.134 --> 05:45.470
and Lindsay has...
what does Gwyneth Paltrow say?

05:45.553 --> 05:47.055
"Consciously un-cuckold" me.

05:47.138 --> 05:48.890
You want to stay a part
of the Bluth family?

05:49.807 --> 05:50.683
I have a feeling...

05:51.976 --> 05:53.102
you do, too.

05:53.478 --> 05:55.396
Despite your claims of leaving.

05:55.480 --> 05:57.690
No, no, it's not a claim. I'm leaving.

05:57.774 --> 05:59.025
You always seem to be.

05:59.108 --> 06:00.276
Well, I'm doing it.

06:00.360 --> 06:02.070
I'm gonna map the ocean floor.

06:03.071 --> 06:04.405
Michael, if I could...

06:04.489 --> 06:07.116
put my therapist leggings on
for one second.

06:07.200 --> 06:09.243
- Just sit, sit, sit, sit, sit,
- Yeah, sure.

06:09.327 --> 06:12.038
- Sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit.
- Tobias, please.

06:13.456 --> 06:14.832
I would just say that

06:14.916 --> 06:17.752
you're trying to run away from people
before they have a chance

06:17.835 --> 06:19.837
to run away from you,
because that's what the people

06:19.921 --> 06:21.339
you love do.

06:21.422 --> 06:22.340
Isn't it?

06:23.174 --> 06:24.300
What people?

06:24.384 --> 06:25.510
Your wife.

06:25.885 --> 06:26.886
- Uh...
- Your son.

06:27.637 --> 06:28.679
Or should I say...

06:30.181 --> 06:31.641
...me?

06:31.724 --> 06:33.309
Don't. Uh, you know...

06:33.393 --> 06:35.395
- "Why'd Mommy leave, Daddy?"
- Tobias...

06:35.478 --> 06:38.940
"- I didn't leave.
- I loved you bo..."

06:39.023 --> 06:40.608
I don't think you want to go there, okay?

06:40.691 --> 06:43.027
Yes, yes, yes. I suppose I did...

06:43.111 --> 06:44.070
start too high.

06:44.153 --> 06:46.155
Okay, let's bring everyone down an octave.

06:46.239 --> 06:47.782
- "Why did Mommy leave, Daddy?"
- Tobias...

06:47.865 --> 06:49.826
- "I didn't leave. I loved you both."
- Listen.

06:49.909 --> 06:51.869
Tobias, listen,
I don't want you playing my son.

06:51.953 --> 06:55.039
And I'm not confused at all
about what happened to Tracey.

06:55.123 --> 06:58.334
Really?
Because you certainly never talk about it.

06:58.418 --> 07:00.336
I was raising a son.
Think I want to burden him

07:00.420 --> 07:02.296
with memories
that are gonna make him feel worse?

07:02.380 --> 07:06.050
Please. What about Michael's memories?

07:06.134 --> 07:10.555
Why can't you go back to the last place
you saw Tracey? Hmm?

07:10.638 --> 07:13.182
- The family beach cottage?
- No, no,

07:13.266 --> 07:15.143
I was thinking more, uh, uh,

07:15.226 --> 07:16.727
- metaphorically.
- Yeah.

07:16.811 --> 07:18.938
But that's where we spent
the last months of her life.

07:19.021 --> 07:20.940
And-and after she died,

07:21.023 --> 07:23.401
the family sold that house.

07:23.484 --> 07:25.319
It was one of the kindest things

07:25.403 --> 07:27.280
that-that they ever did for me.

07:27.363 --> 07:29.157
- Do you think that I should go there?
- Uh,

07:29.240 --> 07:31.451
my number one rule is
"don't tell Michael...

07:33.619 --> 07:35.872
what to do."
Now, um, I will say, though,

07:35.955 --> 07:37.832
I wish I had known
you'd had such depth

07:37.915 --> 07:40.835
before I gave your part away
to a less experienced actor.

07:41.502 --> 07:43.296
I didn't know there was such a thing.

07:43.379 --> 07:45.214
Get your stuff. We're out of here.

07:45.673 --> 07:47.133
And where are we going, Father?

07:47.216 --> 07:48.926
Nowhere.
I was just practicing the new skit.

07:49.010 --> 07:50.761
Remember the lineÂ where he says,

07:50.845 --> 07:52.763
- "Get your stuff"?
- I'm improv'ing,

07:52.847 --> 07:54.265
you over-intending schmactor.

07:54.348 --> 07:57.226
This is the simplest character
in the entire family.

07:57.310 --> 07:59.187
He has one personality trait:

07:59.479 --> 08:00.813
he always comes back.

08:00.897 --> 08:03.024
Well, that and he always has his hands
in his pockets.

08:03.107 --> 08:04.150
You got peanuts in there?

08:04.609 --> 08:06.444
Okay, why am I staying here for this?

08:07.278 --> 08:08.488
Why can't I just be your son?

08:08.571 --> 08:10.573
Oh, there is no son anymore.
He cut the part.

08:10.990 --> 08:13.367
And I can't be your father.
I'm not a straight man.

08:13.451 --> 08:16.287
<i>Why are </i> we <i>staying here for this?</i>
<i>Anyway, Michael,</i>

08:16.370 --> 08:18.915
<i>in his haste to leave town,
arrived at the dock</i>

08:18.998 --> 08:21.751
<i>for his ocean floor mapping expedition</i>

08:21.834 --> 08:23.836
<i>for what he was certain
was a six-bells departure.</i>

08:23.920 --> 08:25.713
No, we leave at 6:00 p.m.

08:25.796 --> 08:28.216
You telling me we've got a 14-bell delay?

08:28.299 --> 08:30.259
I don't know, man.
But we leave in seven hours.

08:30.343 --> 08:31.761
Yeah. Okay.

08:31.844 --> 08:33.596
<i>And he was encouraged</i>
<i>to use the time</i>

08:33.679 --> 08:36.432
<i>to try out his undersea
camera survey equipment.</i>

08:36.515 --> 08:39.683
All right, let's have it.
Great. Look at that, huh?

08:39.769 --> 08:41.979
<i>And once in the water,</i>
<i>Michael felt like he was</i>

08:42.063 --> 08:45.191
<i>finally able to let go of the past
and forget about</i>

08:45.274 --> 08:47.318
<i>everything he was leaving behind.</i>

08:49.779 --> 08:52.865
<i>George Michael, meanwhile,
felt no such peace.</i>

08:53.241 --> 08:56.911
<i>Although he was surprised
that his evasive run-in with his father...</i>

08:56.994 --> 08:58.996
There's enough of these
for this to be a thing?

08:59.080 --> 09:00.081
<i>...was less dramatic</i>

09:00.164 --> 09:01.207
<i>than he recalled.</i>

09:01.290 --> 09:04.669
<i>And he sought out Maeby
at what she'd said was her new place.</i>

09:04.752 --> 09:06.879
- Hello.
- Looking for a grandparent?

09:06.963 --> 09:09.423
No, thank you. I...
No, I have enough. I'm, uh...

09:09.507 --> 09:11.217
I think I might be at the wrong address.

09:11.300 --> 09:13.302
I'm looking for someone
who I cannot imagine meets

09:13.386 --> 09:15.888
- your residency requirements here.
- Rose, he's fine.

09:15.972 --> 09:17.348
It's all right. He's with me.

09:17.431 --> 09:19.308
This is
where you're living, a senior center?

09:19.392 --> 09:20.893
Yeah, just wait.
Hey, Rose, do you mind?

09:21.310 --> 09:22.728
Thank you.

09:23.062 --> 09:24.480
I needed somewhere
to lay low

09:24.564 --> 09:26.232
until the Perfecto thing blew over.

09:26.315 --> 09:29.151
But you said
this place was incredible.

09:29.819 --> 09:31.696
- This is incredible!
- Right?

09:31.821 --> 09:34.198
Why is the lobby
so off-putting?

09:34.282 --> 09:36.867
That's what the seniors do
to keep the young people away.

09:36.951 --> 09:38.995
They don't want "dot-commers" taking over.

09:39.078 --> 09:41.205
- Nice. Like you and me.
- Exactly.

09:41.289 --> 09:42.957
How were you able to get in?

09:43.040 --> 09:44.709
When I came back from Mexico,

09:44.792 --> 09:47.253
I found a parking pass
in Lucille 2's Cadillac, right?

09:47.336 --> 09:49.922
And, apparently,
she kept a place for these "trysts"

09:50.006 --> 09:51.882
with old lovers from years ago.

09:51.966 --> 09:53.884
Or they were co-owners or something.

09:53.968 --> 09:55.761
But they just kept it here, empty,

09:55.845 --> 09:57.471
until one of them needed it.

09:57.555 --> 09:59.098
So that was lucky.

09:59.181 --> 10:01.350
I just had to make myself
look older, you know?

10:01.601 --> 10:04.437
Yeah, I would think that that'd
be a great use of the gray wig.

10:04.520 --> 10:06.063
No, I went down that road.

10:06.147 --> 10:07.857
<i>But wasn't expecting</i>
<i>how upsetting it is</i>

10:07.940 --> 10:10.401
<i>to see one's self grown old.</i>

10:10.484 --> 10:12.778
<i>The moment
when a young woman realizes...</i>

10:12.862 --> 10:14.905
Oh, my God,
I've become my father.

10:14.989 --> 10:16.949
âª <i>In the most delicious way!</i> âª

10:17.033 --> 10:18.451
Oh, so this is a choice.

10:18.534 --> 10:19.785
I didn't want to say anything,

10:19.869 --> 10:22.371
but I was like, "Maeby looks
like a 65-year-old."

10:22.455 --> 10:25.207
- What if I told you I was 75? Hmm?
- Holy shit.

10:26.083 --> 10:27.668
- You look fantastic.
- Right?

10:27.752 --> 10:30.338
It's the teeth. It's the same guy
who's doing my meth teeth,

10:30.421 --> 10:32.298
you know,
for the family of the year thing.

10:32.381 --> 10:35.384
Where I write a speech for my mom,
she talks about how great I am, then...

10:35.468 --> 10:37.053
Then you open your mouth
and you're like,

10:37.136 --> 10:39.221
"So why do I have to turn tricks
for meth money?"

10:39.305 --> 10:41.474
I don't know how you keep
all your scams straight.

10:41.557 --> 10:44.560
Well, this old lady one is a big,
big score.

10:44.810 --> 10:48.230
I mean, when people catch on,
they either forget or they die.

10:48.314 --> 10:50.941
And, I mean,
this place is a dream.

10:51.025 --> 10:52.443
Nobody even locks their doors.

10:52.526 --> 10:54.987
Of course,
what is there to steal?

10:55.071 --> 10:57.156
A few barstools and some family pictures?

10:57.490 --> 11:02.161
Anyway, that's how I got those barstools
and all these great pictures of grandkids.

11:02.787 --> 11:04.914
- What a beautiful family you've stolen.
- Mm.

11:04.997 --> 11:07.917
What are you gonna do if Lucille 2
or the friend she owns this with shows up?

11:08.000 --> 11:09.669
He kind of already has.

11:10.461 --> 11:12.713
<i>Maeby had only been</i>
<i>in the place for a week</i>

11:12.797 --> 11:16.634
<i>and had spent most of that time
trying to trap a swan in her condo...</i>

11:16.717 --> 11:18.010
What's your problem? It's tuna.

11:18.094 --> 11:19.762
<i>...when she came across a stranger,</i>

11:19.845 --> 11:22.098
<i>whom longtime viewers
will be mildly surprised</i>

11:22.181 --> 11:24.850
<i>- to recognize is Stan Sitwell.</i>
- Hello.

11:24.934 --> 11:26.602
- <i>But whom Maeby did not.</i>
- Hello.

11:26.686 --> 11:28.020
Do you live in one of these?

11:28.104 --> 11:30.272
- This one's mine, yes.
- Well, that's strange.

11:30.356 --> 11:32.983
Do you realize this condo
is listed as Lucille Austero's?

11:33.275 --> 11:34.819
Yes. I am her.

11:36.362 --> 11:37.363
Sister.

11:37.822 --> 11:39.281
I am her sister.

11:39.365 --> 11:40.616
You're going the wrong way.

11:41.117 --> 11:41.951
Annette?

11:42.034 --> 11:43.744
Great idea. Do you think they have one?

11:43.828 --> 11:44.745
Have what?

11:45.287 --> 11:47.456
Annette. Yes, that's me.

11:47.832 --> 11:49.750
And you are?

11:49.834 --> 11:53.003
Stan. I must admit,
I'm a little confused right now.

11:53.087 --> 11:56.716
Our agreement was that this place
would revert back to me once Lucille...

12:02.596 --> 12:04.432
...gave up her interest.

12:05.182 --> 12:07.351
Well, I don't know anything about that.

12:07.435 --> 12:09.311
She signed it over to me.

12:09.395 --> 12:11.397
I'd like to see that paperwork.

12:12.732 --> 12:13.607
Yes.

12:14.150 --> 12:16.652
Well, I recently moved here
from New Orleans,

12:16.736 --> 12:20.197
- and I...
<i>- Maeby was proud of this lie.</i>

12:20.281 --> 12:23.701
...lost all my personal paperwork
in Hurricane Cantina.

12:24.702 --> 12:26.620
Ooh. That's complicated.

12:27.455 --> 12:29.081
Yes. It is.

12:29.623 --> 12:32.376
Unless I'm expected to lose a home
for the second time.

12:33.544 --> 12:37.006
Of course, I could just pack up
my shorty shorts,

12:37.089 --> 12:39.717
my silky pajamas, my peekaboo bras,

12:39.800 --> 12:42.595
my ticklers, sex knobs, and lacy hoo-has

12:42.970 --> 12:44.054
and hit the road.

12:44.930 --> 12:46.432
I can't ask you to do that.

12:46.515 --> 12:47.850
<i>This place is yours?</i>

12:47.933 --> 12:50.269
Not yet, but maybe I'll kick him out
sooner than later.

12:50.936 --> 12:53.439
Maybe I'll kick him out
once he gets off that goddamn chair.

12:54.023 --> 12:55.399
That's him?

12:55.483 --> 12:57.276
- Yeah.
- Why aren't we whispering?

12:57.568 --> 12:58.736
Oh. He can't hear a thing.

12:58.819 --> 13:01.113
- He's got horrible aids.
<i>- Shoedini!</i>

13:01.197 --> 13:03.115
<i>The world's first shoe horn...</i>

13:03.199 --> 13:04.116
Oh, hearing aids.

13:04.200 --> 13:06.076
Yeah, yeah, here they call them aids.

13:06.160 --> 13:08.287
The other ones they call
aids.

13:08.370 --> 13:11.624
Don't worry, if he asks who you are,
I'll just tell him you're Tom Collins.

13:11.707 --> 13:13.751
He's always asking for a Tom Collins.

13:13.834 --> 13:16.879
Believe me, I'm in over my head enough
as it is being George Maharis.

13:16.962 --> 13:18.464
Which is what I wanted to talk
to you about.

13:18.547 --> 13:21.175
So I told my Dad
that I was still dating Rebel.

13:21.634 --> 13:23.928
What? Why'd you do that?

13:24.011 --> 13:25.638
You told me to do it. It was your idea.

13:25.721 --> 13:27.598
- Mm-mm.
- I mean, I still haven't even seen her

13:27.681 --> 13:29.183
- since I punched him.
- No, no, no.

13:29.266 --> 13:32.603
I told you that your dad
is still in love with Rebel.

13:33.062 --> 13:35.606
And that telling him you haven't seen her
would be more hurtful.

13:35.689 --> 13:38.317
You perverted that
into a way to not hurt him.

13:38.400 --> 13:41.028
And then I had to turn down
this scuba trip, which is also rude,

13:41.111 --> 13:42.780
and if he finds out he's gonna say,

13:42.863 --> 13:45.241
"You lied to me, George Michael,
and that's worse."

13:45.324 --> 13:47.243
You know he's gonna say
"and that's worse."

13:47.326 --> 13:50.287
You would've had to lie about scuba,
'cause you would've been scared.

13:50.371 --> 13:52.414
Why do you say I'm scared of scuba?
I'm not.

13:53.082 --> 13:54.583
You passed out at the aquarium.

13:55.543 --> 13:58.671
They make you feel like you're underwater
with all these giant...

13:59.338 --> 14:01.757
- Dolphins?
- I think that was some kind of smiling,

14:01.841 --> 14:03.884
kind of bemused baby shark.

14:04.343 --> 14:05.678
I don't know, things are volatile

14:05.761 --> 14:07.763
with my dad right now.
It feels very combustible.

14:07.847 --> 14:10.850
Feels like we're on the edge of
physical menace or something,

14:10.933 --> 14:14.478
which I've trained myself for,
but has he been training, too?

14:14.562 --> 14:15.813
What was that in the hallway?

14:15.896 --> 14:17.857
Look. Here's my advice. Okay?

14:17.940 --> 14:19.149
You go to Rebel's,

14:19.233 --> 14:21.652
you take my bag of lacy ticklers,
hoo-ha bras, dog toys,

14:21.735 --> 14:22.903
and sex knobs with you.

14:22.987 --> 14:25.114
And you act like you're expecting
a booty call,

14:25.197 --> 14:27.157
as the old people think
the young people say.

14:27.241 --> 14:29.076
All right?
You tell her, "I'm here for a quickie,

14:29.159 --> 14:30.202
and I'm out of here."

14:30.286 --> 14:33.622
Mr. Brash.
And she'll drop you like a buttered cane.

14:34.248 --> 14:36.792
- Something old people say?
- Yeah. I'm trying to get it going.

14:37.835 --> 14:39.837
- That's cool.
<i>- George Michael's father</i>

14:39.920 --> 14:42.089
<i>had drifted farther south
than he realized,</i>

14:42.923 --> 14:44.717
<i>despite swimming with a GPS system</i>

14:44.800 --> 14:47.970
<i>that cost roughly as much
as Buster's left thumb.</i>

14:48.512 --> 14:50.639
<i>And he soon found himself</i>

14:50.723 --> 14:53.475
<i>on a part of the beach he hadn't been to
in over 20 years.</i>

14:56.145 --> 14:59.231
âª <i>I'm coming home</i> âª

14:59.315 --> 15:01.317
âª <i>Home, home</i> âª

15:02.735 --> 15:03.777
I love that house.

15:05.321 --> 15:07.865
Yeah. My family used to own it
back in the '80s.

15:07.948 --> 15:10.034
Too bad they sold it,
it's worth a fortune now.

15:10.117 --> 15:11.285
My wife died there.

15:11.368 --> 15:13.662
Ovarian cancer, actually.

15:13.746 --> 15:15.289
- He's a liar.
- And...

15:15.372 --> 15:16.957
He shouldn't have said that.

15:17.041 --> 15:18.959
- Ignore the man.
- Good to see you.

15:21.253 --> 15:24.965
<i>And Michael decided that</i>
<i>perhaps Tobias was right.</i>

15:25.507 --> 15:28.302
<i>Perhaps he did need to look the grim truth</i>

15:28.385 --> 15:31.347
<i>of mortality... in the face.</i>

15:33.057 --> 15:35.351
Oh shit, he found out.

15:40.147 --> 15:41.941
<i>Michael had just discovered</i>

15:42.024 --> 15:44.318
<i>his family never sold
their family cottage.</i>

15:44.401 --> 15:46.695
...lied to me, and that's worse.

15:46.779 --> 15:49.698
I am stunned. I just...
I literally saidit would be so great

15:49.782 --> 15:51.742
if my family had kept the cottage.

15:51.825 --> 15:52.826
We did.

15:52.910 --> 15:54.745
I know. You shouldn't have.

15:54.828 --> 15:56.413
Well, then either way, you're unhappy.

15:56.872 --> 15:58.165
I mean, pick a lane.

15:58.499 --> 16:00.626
You pick... you pick a lane.

16:00.709 --> 16:02.252
What did you want us to do, Michael?

16:02.336 --> 16:04.797
It was a horrible time
for the housing market.

16:05.089 --> 16:07.841
Were we supposed to lose
our precious daughter-in-law

16:07.925 --> 16:10.135
and a couple hundred grand
in the same year?

16:10.219 --> 16:13.097
- Why didn't you just tell me?
- Because we love you.

16:13.764 --> 16:16.266
- And nobody wanted your feelings hurt.
- Mm.

16:16.350 --> 16:18.227
- That was rule one.
- Rule one?

16:18.310 --> 16:21.105
It slipped down a little
when we put in the new floors.

16:21.188 --> 16:23.440
And by that point, you were already dating

16:23.524 --> 16:26.026
and in love with that total re...

16:27.444 --> 16:29.822
that totally lovely Rita.

16:29.905 --> 16:31.740
Uh, she was a smart cookie, that one.

16:31.824 --> 16:32.992
Nice try, Mom.

16:33.075 --> 16:36.286
And we didn't want to bring up
those bad old memories.

16:36.370 --> 16:39.289
Besides, this place already
has enough bad ones for me.

16:40.040 --> 16:41.333
My mother died here.

16:42.126 --> 16:43.794
G.O.B. was born here.

16:44.670 --> 16:45.838
And I'm sure you've heard,

16:45.921 --> 16:47.881
it was also your father's pad.

16:47.965 --> 16:49.717
Only from the next room.

16:49.800 --> 16:52.594
Please believe me,
if I could turn back time,

16:52.678 --> 16:54.596
- I never would've answered that door.
- I know.

16:55.806 --> 16:57.558
Were you slightly worried

16:57.641 --> 17:00.269
that I might come out here one day, Mom?

17:00.811 --> 17:03.522
H-Honestly, I never thought
you'd get past the guard gate.

17:03.605 --> 17:06.066
I could barely get past them
when Tobias and I got here.

17:06.150 --> 17:08.402
Tobias.
He's the one that put coming out here

17:08.483 --> 17:10.988
- in my mind in the first place.
- He what?

17:11.069 --> 17:13.699
- As a metaphor.
- You're out!

17:13.781 --> 17:15.659
But I've already pinked away my sideburns

17:15.742 --> 17:18.787
to play Buster at the family of the year
ceremony tonight.

17:18.871 --> 17:20.539
And Buster's already invited a date.

17:20.622 --> 17:23.915
Come out
and meet your boyfriend, Lucille.

17:26.377 --> 17:28.005
Murph?

17:29.548 --> 17:32.009
Oh, I see you finally figured out
how to use that contraption.

17:32.092 --> 17:33.093
I'm on the phone.

17:33.177 --> 17:34.428
- Just one second.
- What?

17:34.595 --> 17:35.846
I'm talking on the phone.

17:35.929 --> 17:37.264
Who are you talking to?

17:37.347 --> 17:39.850
Didn't you tell me I was supposed
to be busting with my girlfriend?

17:39.933 --> 17:42.311
I said, you're Buster's girlfriend.

17:42.853 --> 17:43.896
Oh. Hang on.

17:44.646 --> 17:45.856
Wait. Wait.

17:45.939 --> 17:48.984
- Am I supposed... Am I your boyfriend?
- No!

17:49.068 --> 17:51.862
You are... I'm... A girl.

17:52.362 --> 17:55.407
You're a girl, Linds,
uh, Murphy B... Lucille.

17:55.491 --> 17:58.786
- Is he supposed to be me?
- Uh-uh-uh, Lucille Number 2.

17:58.869 --> 18:00.871
She's quite the grande dame.

18:00.954 --> 18:03.457
It's basically Michael
without the peanut pockets.

18:03.540 --> 18:06.001
You know,
you're playing her like you played

18:06.085 --> 18:08.212
that stammering mess of a Buster,
and it won't do.

18:08.295 --> 18:12.007
Sometimes I don't even think
that you want to be an actor.

18:12.091 --> 18:15.302
Actually, sometimes,
I think I want to be a dog doctor. Ow!

18:15.385 --> 18:17.554
This is the role of a lifetime.

18:17.638 --> 18:18.931
Now, I know 50 gentlemen

18:19.014 --> 18:21.475
who would tuck their last nut
to play this part.

18:21.558 --> 18:24.186
Okay?
Now, he saves it for the day.

18:24.269 --> 18:27.731
When you see him at the campaign event,
you'll think you're looking at

18:27.815 --> 18:31.985
a 72-year-old pink mustachioed
Lucille Austero.

18:32.069 --> 18:35.697
- We can't have Lucille Austero!
- We can't have Lucille Austero.

18:35.781 --> 18:37.533
She's running against Lindsay,
for God's sake.

18:37.616 --> 18:38.534
For God's sake.

18:38.617 --> 18:40.702
I don't even know why I'm having
this conversation.

18:40.786 --> 18:43.122
You're out!
We don't even need a Buster.

18:43.705 --> 18:45.666
Well, at least you're being honest
about that.

18:45.749 --> 18:47.459
So you admit you've got Buster.

18:47.543 --> 18:50.754
This again?
Why would I hide Buster from you?

18:50.838 --> 18:52.589
You want me to think that he's missing.

18:52.673 --> 18:54.633
You're trying to teach me a lesson.
You're tryingÂ to get even

18:54.716 --> 18:56.135
because I'm trying to teach...

18:57.177 --> 18:58.595
I don't know why you're trying

18:58.679 --> 19:00.889
to teach me a lesson,
so lesson not learned, Mother.

19:00.973 --> 19:02.641
Michael, did you do something

19:02.724 --> 19:05.144
for which we should be
teaching you a lesson?

19:05.227 --> 19:06.645
Mother!

19:10.232 --> 19:12.109
He's here, isn't he?

19:12.192 --> 19:13.652
Tell me he's not in that bedroom,

19:13.735 --> 19:15.279
- not where Tracey...
- Don't go in there.

19:15.362 --> 19:16.405
...spent her last...

19:19.074 --> 19:20.909
Oh, someone told Michael.

19:20.993 --> 19:23.412
Does this mean we can start leaving towels
on the floor?

19:23.495 --> 19:24.705
What are you doing?

19:24.788 --> 19:27.249
I'm making this into a trophy for Dad.

19:27.332 --> 19:29.042
I can't wait to see
the one you got yourself.

19:29.126 --> 19:30.919
Uh, yeah, Michael. Please.

19:31.003 --> 19:33.630
I'm the president or CEO
or whatever of the Bluth Company.

19:33.714 --> 19:35.966
I control the company checkbook,
so I don't need

19:36.049 --> 19:38.802
false things to make me feel important.

19:38.886 --> 19:40.971
- Okay.
- There's no trophy for that.

19:41.054 --> 19:42.472
<i>Although he did visit</i>

19:42.556 --> 19:45.475
<i>- a trophy store earlier that day.</i>
- It's a good time to be in this business.

19:46.101 --> 19:47.811
Everyone gets a trophy.

19:47.895 --> 19:49.730
I tell people to stay away
from the business.

19:50.147 --> 19:52.232
It's always been a lousy business,
and these days

19:52.316 --> 19:54.151
- everybody shops online.
- Everybody gets a trophy.

19:54.693 --> 19:56.361
A trophy, huh? Yeah.

19:56.862 --> 19:58.780
Well, that may be, but tell me this,

19:58.864 --> 20:02.284
how many people get a whole
trophy store?

20:04.161 --> 20:05.245
Oh, yeah.

20:06.496 --> 20:07.956
You can't be serious.

20:08.040 --> 20:10.000
So the guy was like,
"Are you shitting me?"

20:10.083 --> 20:12.836
That's usually the sign
that you've made yourself a great deal.

20:12.920 --> 20:17.090
So, I told him, "I'm gonna need you
to cobble together one last trophy,

20:17.883 --> 20:19.259
old trophy cobbler,

20:19.343 --> 20:21.595
for the family of the year
ceremony tonight."

20:21.678 --> 20:24.973
And I said, "I want you to find
the biggest golden anchor you can find."

20:26.016 --> 20:27.476
So they didn't have one of those?

20:27.559 --> 20:29.436
No, he didn't even have keys
to the back room.

20:29.519 --> 20:31.396
Also, the heat doesn't turn off.

20:31.480 --> 20:33.649
This took a couple hours,
so once I give this to Dad,

20:33.732 --> 20:36.902
then I'll have Joni Beard
give me the deed to the trophy store.

20:36.985 --> 20:39.071
Wait till you see it!

20:40.280 --> 20:42.407
I'm not gonna be there. Oh, uh...

20:42.491 --> 20:45.160
let me ask you a question,
and I want you to be honest with me.

20:45.244 --> 20:48.038
Are you doing something with Busty?

20:48.121 --> 20:51.124
<i>Michael was referring</i>
<i>to his missing brother, Buster.</i>

20:51.208 --> 20:55.045
<i>But G.O.B., who hadn't been with a woman
since he'd gotten closer to this man...</i>

20:55.128 --> 20:57.130
I was wondering what
you were going to pop out of.

20:57.214 --> 20:58.840
<i>- ...I mean this one...
- VÃ¡monos.</i>

20:59.925 --> 21:03.637
<i>...thought that "Busty"
was referring to this woman...</i>

21:03.720 --> 21:05.013
Where's the nitrous?

21:05.097 --> 21:07.516
<i>...whom he really hadn't done
much fooling with at all.</i>

21:07.599 --> 21:09.101
<i>Which is why he answered...</i>

21:10.519 --> 21:12.229
<i>- eventually...</i>
<i>- </i> Yes.

21:15.440 --> 21:16.900
Got my answer.

21:17.025 --> 21:19.486
You really don't care
about your children's feelings, do you?

21:19.569 --> 21:21.405
Oh, you're one to give parenting lessons.

21:21.488 --> 21:24.992
I hear I'm not the only one
whose son has a nasty left hook.

21:25.409 --> 21:27.035
Hmm, yeah, well...

21:27.661 --> 21:29.246
You know, at least he did something

21:29.329 --> 21:30.789
that we have not been able to do.

21:30.872 --> 21:32.874
He stood up for himself
when his father was wrong.

21:32.958 --> 21:34.584
In fact, it might be the thing

21:34.668 --> 21:36.295
that I'm most proud of him for.

21:36.670 --> 21:37.504
Hope he knows that.

21:37.587 --> 21:39.381
Uh, he definitely does not.

21:40.716 --> 21:42.092
- What's that?
- I just saw him...

21:42.175 --> 21:45.220
uh, heard him, rather... at the model home
when I was on my way out.

21:45.304 --> 21:47.639
- George Michael's at the model home?
<i>- </i> Well, if it wasn't him,

21:47.723 --> 21:49.182
it was somebody who certainly did

21:49.266 --> 21:53.061
a heck of a lot better
impression of him than me.

21:53.812 --> 21:56.231
- Well, that could be anyone.
- Well, well...

21:58.191 --> 21:59.526
Goodbye forever.

21:59.609 --> 22:00.485
See you tonight.

22:00.569 --> 22:02.904
- See you tonight.
- See you tonight.

22:02.988 --> 22:06.116
<i>So, Michael changed</i>
<i>and raced to the model home.</i>

22:06.199 --> 22:08.243
<i>But his hopes for an emotional</i>

22:08.327 --> 22:09.286
<i>- father-son reunion...</i>
- Hey.

22:09.369 --> 22:12.080
I'm sorry if things got, uh...
Are you crying? Hey.

22:12.164 --> 22:13.206
<i>...were ruined...</i>

22:13.290 --> 22:14.374
- Hey.
- Oh.

22:14.458 --> 22:16.710
<i>...by an emotional father-son reunion.</i>

22:16.793 --> 22:17.836
Tonight's the big night.

22:17.919 --> 22:19.421
Family of the year day.

22:19.504 --> 22:21.340
What are you doing
in George Michael's bed?

22:21.423 --> 22:24.217
Oh... just a little...

22:24.593 --> 22:27.137
...just a little
weep and sleep, you know.

22:27.220 --> 22:28.263
- Uh-huh.
- Yeah.

22:28.347 --> 22:29.806
Want to be the big man, so...

22:30.390 --> 22:33.477
Can't do it at the office, obviously,
and Lindsay's at the penthouse,

22:33.560 --> 22:35.103
and I can't go to the cot...

22:35.729 --> 22:38.774
Well, we don't... We only...
we only have the penthouse,

22:38.857 --> 22:40.359
- so I-I, uh, I came here.
- Mmm.

22:40.442 --> 22:41.735
I know about the cottage.

22:41.818 --> 22:43.403
- I hated that rule.
- Okay.

22:43.487 --> 22:44.946
- Michael?
- Hmm.

22:45.030 --> 22:47.157
- I hated <i>both </i> rules.
- Oh, yeah, the towels.

22:47.240 --> 22:48.492
Can I ask you a question?

22:48.575 --> 22:50.118
How'd you get past the guard gate?

22:50.202 --> 22:51.661
I came from the water.

22:52.537 --> 22:55.457
I knew it. I told her. I told her,
"He's gonna take us from the beach."

22:56.249 --> 22:57.834
Well, I am glad. I am glad you did.

22:58.293 --> 23:00.629
Yeah, it's just your mother and her rules.

23:01.630 --> 23:04.049
And I hated "no sand in the living room."

23:04.132 --> 23:05.675
Why have a beach house

23:05.759 --> 23:08.387
if every member of the family
can't enjoy it?

23:08.470 --> 23:10.722
You look like
you're not enjoying anything.

23:10.806 --> 23:11.973
- You all right?
- Yeah.

23:12.057 --> 23:13.475
Your mom and I are...

23:13.558 --> 23:15.394
We're not together.

23:15.477 --> 23:17.062
We're not together in the...

23:17.145 --> 23:19.564
well, I guess in, uh,
every meaning of that word.

23:19.648 --> 23:22.275
I assumed that, but, uh,
why aren't you enjoying that?

23:22.359 --> 23:25.904
Because your mom
is being courted, Michael.

23:27.197 --> 23:28.615
Someone is fawning all over her.

23:29.408 --> 23:31.076
- I knew she had Buster.
- No.

23:31.159 --> 23:33.161
- I knew it.
- This one's not Buster.

23:33.245 --> 23:35.330
I mean, I wish that guy was Buster.

23:35.414 --> 23:37.833
Him I could fight, you know? You see,

23:37.916 --> 23:39.334
this guy got past me.

23:39.418 --> 23:41.670
How can your mother do this to me?

23:41.753 --> 23:43.964
I knew I should've sold that property

23:44.047 --> 23:45.006
when Stacy died.

23:45.841 --> 23:47.134
Tracey.

23:47.217 --> 23:48.802
No, we would've lost a fortune

23:48.885 --> 23:51.263
if we sold when Tracey died.

23:51.346 --> 23:53.932
No, Stacy was the paralegal
I used to bring out there

23:54.015 --> 23:55.267
who went into insulin shock

23:55.350 --> 23:57.394
at the very height of the market.

23:58.061 --> 23:58.895
Sad.

23:58.979 --> 24:00.355
How can she do this to me?

24:00.439 --> 24:01.606
Yeah.

24:01.690 --> 24:03.275
How can your mother do this?

24:03.358 --> 24:05.819
<i>Actually,</i>
<i>she hadn't done anything yet.</i>

24:05.902 --> 24:08.905
<i>But a few weeks earlier at the cottage...</i>

24:08.989 --> 24:12.325
When my daughter wins this election,
we're going to be wall-to-wall wall.

24:12.409 --> 24:13.827
<i>ZÃ ijiÃ n.</i>

24:13.910 --> 24:16.872
<i>...a nuisance washed up
on her beach.</i>

24:16.955 --> 24:18.123
You know, I smashed my phone

24:18.206 --> 24:20.208
a couple years ago, too. With a hammer.

24:20.292 --> 24:21.626
Never missed it.

24:21.710 --> 24:24.004
Miss the hammer, but I guess that's why

24:24.087 --> 24:25.380
God made rocks.

24:25.464 --> 24:26.798
But God made those rocks

24:26.882 --> 24:28.967
and put them
in front of my cottage for me,

24:29.050 --> 24:30.635
so let's just leave them there.

24:31.178 --> 24:32.804
I know the law pretty well,

24:32.888 --> 24:34.681
and I can pick up any rock I want.

24:34.764 --> 24:37.934
Well, what do you use those for,
anyway, Sand Hippie?

24:38.018 --> 24:39.728
- Making a yoga garden?
- No.

24:39.811 --> 24:42.189
I throw 'em at people that got no business

24:42.272 --> 24:43.940
being on this part of the beach.

24:44.024 --> 24:45.901
<i>He had done so for years...</i>

24:45.984 --> 24:48.361
<i>Van Halen was in town
this weekend rocking audiences.</i>

24:48.445 --> 24:51.281
<i>But some beachgoers are getting
rocked in a different way</i>

24:51.364 --> 24:54.576
<i>by a group calling themselves
the Newport Bay Boys.</i>

24:54.659 --> 24:57.412
<i>...in what started</i>
<i>as a cool, rich kid surfer gang</i>

24:57.496 --> 24:58.788
<i>that had been possessive</i>

24:58.872 --> 25:01.333
<i>about Newport's most beautiful cove...</i>

25:01.416 --> 25:03.418
<i>Nirvana was in town
this weekend rocking audiences.</i>

25:03.502 --> 25:06.755
<i>But some beachgoers are getting rocked
in a different way...</i>

25:06.838 --> 25:08.048
<i>...and became a group</i>

25:08.131 --> 25:10.675
<i>of kind of hip, middle-aged surfer men</i>

25:10.759 --> 25:12.302
<i>defending their coastline.</i>

25:12.385 --> 25:15.055
<i>50 Cent was in town
this weekend rocking audiences,</i>

25:15.138 --> 25:18.517
<i>but some beachgoers are getting rocked
in a different way.</i>

25:18.600 --> 25:20.810
I think we're good, guys. They're gone.

25:21.311 --> 25:22.479
Yeah, they're gone.

25:22.562 --> 25:23.813
I'm Dusty.

25:23.897 --> 25:25.398
That's a nice way to say it.

25:25.482 --> 25:27.484
But let's not make a habit of this,
shall we?

25:27.817 --> 25:29.528
Now, take your bucket full of rocks

25:29.611 --> 25:30.779
and be gone.

25:30.862 --> 25:32.989
<i>But a habit of it he did make.</i>

25:54.469 --> 25:55.470
Hey!

25:55.554 --> 25:58.390
Get off my beach, you stupid seagulls.

25:59.474 --> 26:00.475
Oh, hi.

26:01.059 --> 26:03.603
Care to join me
for a glass of breakfast wine?

26:03.687 --> 26:06.064
<i>And before long,</i>
<i>they were in the first stages</i>

26:06.147 --> 26:07.440
<i>of a beautiful</i>

26:07.524 --> 26:10.902
<i>early October-late November
relationship.</i>

26:12.904 --> 26:14.281
I mean, he's attracted to her.

26:14.364 --> 26:16.116
He's attracted to her.

26:16.741 --> 26:19.286
I'm sorry. Why would he be
attracted to her if he's blind?

26:19.369 --> 26:21.705
And how did he burn off his fingertips?

26:22.289 --> 26:23.999
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

26:24.082 --> 26:26.334
I may have added the fingertips.

26:26.418 --> 26:28.378
I assume if he's blind,
he's gotta feel her face.

26:28.461 --> 26:30.380
But you said you never saw him
touch her face?

26:30.463 --> 26:31.881
I never said he was blind.

26:31.965 --> 26:34.009
Look, I'm sure it's nothing.
It's probably just

26:34.092 --> 26:36.803
some harmless one-way flirting.
You know, or a Russian prank show.

26:36.886 --> 26:38.972
Maybe I deserve it, you know,

26:39.055 --> 26:40.432
'cause I can't, uh...

26:40.515 --> 26:42.892
I can't deliver the goods.

26:42.976 --> 26:44.519
I shouldn't have lied to you, Michael.

26:44.603 --> 26:45.604
I'm not one to judge.

26:45.687 --> 26:48.523
You know, look, I just...
I just told my son

26:48.607 --> 26:50.442
that I broke up
with the woman that he's seeing,

26:50.525 --> 26:51.610
and in retrospect,

26:51.693 --> 26:53.695
I don't know, maybe she did not hear

26:53.778 --> 26:57.073
"I'm leaving" when I said, uh,
"I ain't going nowhere."

26:57.157 --> 26:59.242
Sounds like a "goodbye forever" to me.

26:59.326 --> 27:02.537
Right? But if she tells my son,
uh, what I said,

27:02.621 --> 27:04.414
you know what he's gonna say.

27:04.497 --> 27:06.333
Uh, "You lied, and that's worse."

27:06.416 --> 27:09.169
Yeah, you know, they can't wait
to say stuff like that.

27:09.252 --> 27:11.004
Mm-hmm. Well,

27:16.384 --> 27:17.677
