One reason interns have so
much trouble putting in chest tubes

00:05.939 --> 00:09.636
is because it is a violent procedure.
You must not be scared, though.

00:09.709 --> 00:12.576
You need to use force to get
the tube between the ribs,

00:12.645 --> 00:16.411
then pop it through the pleura. What
do you say there, Lis? You can do this.

00:16.483 --> 00:19.418
Uh, Dr. Cox, I'm not so sure
I'm comfortable with this.

00:19.486 --> 00:22.922
- You lost my teaching mannequin.
- I don't know what happened to it.

00:25.692 --> 00:27.956
Hello, carpool lane.

00:29.095 --> 00:31.154
[Janitor] What movie do you want to see?

00:31.297 --> 00:34.164
Inserting chest tube.

00:34.234 --> 00:36.498
Lisa! God, he was joking!

00:36.569 --> 00:39.538
Yes, I was, Lisa.
Now take the rest of the afternoon off

00:39.606 --> 00:41.164
and think about what you did.

00:41.241 --> 00:42.765
This is a warning, people.

00:42.842 --> 00:46.471
Anybody else who hurts Keith is going
to get the same treatment as Lisa.

00:46.546 --> 00:47.843
Good day.

00:47.914 --> 00:51.281
Nothing like watching
your boyfriend get humiliated daily.

Baby, look at this! I'm starting to look
like a big fat pregnant lady.

01:01.561 --> 01:04.655
No, you're not. You look like
you let yourself go a little.

01:04.730 --> 01:06.392
[Crying]

01:06.466 --> 01:08.934
OK, that came out wrong.
But baby, it's OK.

01:09.002 --> 01:12.836
You're overreacting because your
pregnancy hormones are taking over.

01:12.906 --> 01:17.172
It's fine. These past few days,
your moods have changed like that.

01:17.243 --> 01:19.302
That is not true!

01:20.046 --> 01:22.276
- That's cool.
- I'm sorry.

01:22.348 --> 01:24.509
Let me kiss the owie.
Kiss the owie.

01:26.786 --> 01:29.755
Baby. Oh, I want to do it right now.

01:29.823 --> 01:32.087
You don't want to
do it now. This'll pass.

01:32.659 --> 01:34.559
This is happening.

01:37.997 --> 01:40.261
You're damn right this is happening.

01:41.734 --> 01:42.894
My mom.

01:44.504 --> 01:48.201
I can't believe she'll
never meet her grandchild.

01:48.274 --> 01:51.243
Do you want to start with kissing,
or get to the good stuff?

01:51.344 --> 01:53.278
What is wrong with you?

01:56.950 --> 01:58.781
When will you learn?

Hello!

02:07.193 --> 02:09.559
J.D., I'm sure you know Kim Briggs.

02:09.662 --> 02:12.756
Uh, no, you big knucklehead, I don't.

02:12.832 --> 02:15.357
On behalf of everyone
here at Sacred Heart,

02:15.435 --> 02:18.165
I'd like to say <i>konichiwa.</i>

02:18.238 --> 02:21.537
- I've been here five years, big guy.
- I know that, Kim.

02:21.608 --> 02:25.339
It's a game. What's your name? Turk.
What's that guy's name? I don't know.

02:25.411 --> 02:28.778
It's a patient. Looks like a Dave.
Are you Dave? We don't know.

02:28.882 --> 02:31.112
- Torture him about this.
- Will do.

02:31.184 --> 02:32.446
Peace out.

02:32.519 --> 02:35.545
How come I never
noticed her before?

02:35.622 --> 02:37.920
Because she wears a wedding ring.

02:37.991 --> 02:40.892
You don't notice women
who wear wedding rings.

02:41.327 --> 02:44.296
- [Turk] Kim was here on your first day.
- That's enough.

02:44.430 --> 02:46.591
[Turk] She was at Ben's funeral.

02:47.367 --> 02:50.530
- Dude, she's been around.

# <i>Ne-me-ne-me</i>

02:53.239 --> 02:56.299
So because she wears a wedding ring,
she's invisible to me?

02:56.376 --> 02:58.640
- Yes.
- Please, T. I'm not that shallow.

02:58.711 --> 03:02.078
Oh, really? Will all women
who are married in the area

03:02.182 --> 03:04.013
please remove your wedding rings?

03:14.360 --> 03:16.123
Hey, J.D.

03:16.196 --> 03:19.723
- I thought you died.
- No, I just got married.

03:19.799 --> 03:21.824
But I sent your family flowers.

03:21.901 --> 03:24.802
I know. You bought them from me.
It was kind of weird.

03:28.007 --> 03:30.100
- Gift shop girl!
- [Girl] What?

03:31.911 --> 03:33.242

<i>She got along with everybody.</i>

extra towels for the ladies' room.

04:09.215 --> 04:10.580
Oh, I got a towel for you.

04:38.511 --> 04:42.470
Mr. Peters, having a gal urologist
might seem a little uncomfortable,

04:42.548 --> 04:45.210
but the penis is
just another excretory organ,

04:45.285 --> 04:47.446
so let's take the stigma off of it.

04:47.520 --> 04:50.853
Now, this is the length
of the average penis.

04:51.591 --> 04:53.115
<i>What?!</i>

04:53.993 --> 04:55.688
That seems about right.

04:55.762 --> 04:59.220
Good for you. I was just messing
with Dr. Dorian over there.

04:59.299 --> 05:01.859
You know what?
I'm not talking to any of you guys.

05:04.103 --> 05:05.593

Oh, my God!

05:11.744 --> 05:16.044
Keith, I know we have plans tonight,
but I am way too tired.

05:16.115 --> 05:18.276
No problem.
I'll call you tomorrow.

05:21.521 --> 05:25.218
Hey, girls. Listen,

05:29.162 --> 05:32.222
so to get back at him,
I'm treating everyone to drinks.

05:32.298 --> 05:35.631
- I'll go.
- You told Keith you were too tired.

05:35.702 --> 05:39.229
I think Keith and I might be done.

05:39.305 --> 05:40.431
What?!

05:42.909 --> 05:45.343
Dorian, can I borrow
that pencil for a second?

05:45.411 --> 05:47.174
Just one second? Thank you.

05:47.914 --> 05:50.974
[Fake Italian accent] Oh, no.
I snapped the pencil.

05:56.756 --> 05:59.623
- I'll have to come by sometime.
- Do it, man.

05:59.692 --> 06:02.252
Wait, I'm mad at you.
You stole my video camera

06:02.362 --> 06:05.195
with the scenes from <i>Dr. Acula,</i>
the movie I'm making.

06:05.264 --> 06:06.891
Why do you think I stole it?

06:06.966 --> 06:10.527
I was surfing the hospital's Web site
and I saw that someone posted

06:10.603 --> 06:13.572
the "Dr. Acula delivers
a baby then eats it" scene.

06:13.639 --> 06:16.608
Someone with the screen name "Rotinaj."

06:16.676 --> 06:19.941
"Rotinaj" is just "Janitor"
spelled backwards, Rotinaj.

06:21.047 --> 06:22.514
Morning, Dr. Rotinaj.

06:22.582 --> 06:24.743
Good morning, Mr. Clean-Up-Man.

06:26.686 --> 06:30.713
Mr. Peters, I looked at your CT scan
and I recommend we don't do surgery.

06:30.790 --> 06:32.257
Great.

06:32.325 --> 06:35.260
This is goodbye,

06:38.131 --> 06:39.462
You take care.

06:40.333 --> 06:43.268
I gave you a new middle initial.
It reassures patients.

06:43.336 --> 06:46.237
The "D" stands for "Dallas"
because I told Mr. Peters

06:46.305 --> 06:49.866
that's where I lost my virginity.
Don't know how we got down that path.

06:49.942 --> 06:52.775
Something about that old man
makes me want to open up.

06:52.845 --> 06:54.540
I hope you like your new initial.

Vampires like it windy.

07:42.528 --> 07:45.691

07:45.798 --> 07:47.732
Look, Keith is sweet,

07:47.800 --> 07:50.268
but after watching him
get walked on again,

07:50.336 --> 07:52.634
I feel like I need
a stronger man in my life.

07:52.705 --> 07:56.766
I want what you have, someone to stand
up for me when I need it, you know?

07:56.843 --> 07:58.572
Someone as confident as Turk

07:58.644 --> 08:00.874

I'm sorry, I don't know your husband.
What are some of his good qualities?

08:06.886 --> 08:10.413
Well, he was a roadie for Jimi Hendrix,
and when it rains,

08:10.490 --> 08:12.253
he carries me to the car.

08:12.325 --> 08:15.158

you should not give up on Keith.

You say he's not strong enough because
he gets stepped on at work,

11:29.689 --> 11:31.316
Elliot!

11:31.390 --> 11:34.154
I'm sorry, but you can't
leave until you promise me

11:34.226 --> 11:35.955
you'll think about it with Keith.

11:36.028 --> 11:40.192
Oh, my God, Carla! Will you
please just butt out of this one?

11:42.768 --> 11:45.134
<i>Especially when things feel a bit fishy.</i>

11:47.640 --> 11:49.733
- Here's your cash.
- Oh, thanks.

11:49.809 --> 11:51.743
Hey, is that a new coat?

11:51.811 --> 11:53.506
Yeah. Just picked it up.

11:53.579 --> 11:55.638
Where did you get the money to buy it?

11:55.715 --> 11:58.980
Mmm, I don't think that's
any business of yours.

12:04.657 --> 12:07.023
<i>Still, it's always good</i>
<i>to hear the truth.</i>

12:07.126 --> 12:10.027
Surgery is really
the only thing that has a shot

12:10.096 --> 12:11.654
at curing this guy,

12:11.731 --> 12:14.199
and the reason that
she's not going to do it

12:14.266 --> 12:17.599
is he's older and has heart issues,
which makes him high risk.

12:17.670 --> 12:21.606
And if he were to drop dead
on her operating table, well,

12:21.674 --> 12:24.734
that would make her
surgery stats go down.

12:24.810 --> 12:29.179
And that wouldn't look very good on
a young doctor's résumé, would it?

12:29.281 --> 12:32.614
<i>Even if it means losing respect</i>
<i>for someone you might like.</i>

12:32.685 --> 12:35.415
What can I say? You got me.

12:36.489 --> 12:37.922
<i>Damn.</i>

12:42.661 --> 12:45.391
Hold on. Dr. Turk,

12:45.464 --> 12:49.423
I covered your gastric-bypass patient
last night. He left a message for you.

12:49.502 --> 12:53.233
- What'd he say?
- You are square.

12:54.473 --> 12:57.135
- [Greasers laughing]
- [Tires squealing]

13:00.079 --> 13:02.377
Stupid greasers.

13:02.448 --> 13:03.915
Oh, here comes Kim.

13:03.983 --> 13:05.644
She had all night to think.

13:05.718 --> 13:08.551
She'll probably be
in a shame spiral. Let's enjoy it.

13:08.621 --> 13:11.749
- Oh, hey, fellas, how you living?
- Large!

13:11.824 --> 13:13.985
What!

13:15.194 --> 13:17.128
What, was I not supposed to answer?

13:17.196 --> 13:19.926
<i>I wasn't the only one</i>
<i>having relationship problems.</i>

13:21.400 --> 13:23.834
Sorry about the way I left last night.

13:23.903 --> 13:25.336
We're OK, right?

13:25.404 --> 13:28.737
Until you receive further notice,
consider us not speaking.

13:28.808 --> 13:32.767
I know you took my money
to buy that ridiculous coat.

13:32.845 --> 13:35.313
I bet you can't prove it.

13:38.751 --> 13:41.982
Enid, you are my eyewitness.

13:42.054 --> 13:45.080
Did he take more than $400?

13:46.192 --> 13:48.524
Enid, is that a new pantsuit?

13:49.562 --> 13:51.826
You think you're
pretty smart, don't you?

13:51.897 --> 13:55.458
All I think is that leather
never goes out of style,

13:55.534 --> 13:59.095
and if you keep money in a pickle jar,
you should know how much is there,

13:59.205 --> 14:02.106
and it won't hurt to buy your invalid
wife something nice

14:02.174 --> 14:04.039
so she can feel pretty.

14:04.109 --> 14:07.738
These are just general thoughts
about life, nothing specific to you.

14:10.649 --> 14:13.550
- Mmm, that was nice. Thank you.
- That wasn't me.

14:13.619 --> 14:15.746
- Hey, dudes.
- Don't "hey, dudes" us.

14:15.821 --> 14:19.382
- You know what bothers me?
- Non-threatening colloquial greetings?

14:19.458 --> 14:23.952
It bothers me that a doctor won't help a
patient so she could keep her stats up.

14:24.029 --> 14:25.997
- Yeah!
- Look, J.D.

14:26.065 --> 14:28.898
Surgery's competitive.
We do what we must to get ahead.

14:28.968 --> 14:30.663
My best friend here's a surgeon,

14:30.736 --> 14:33.899
and he'd never pass
on risky surgery to keep his stats up.

14:33.973 --> 14:36.134
Actually, I have done that.

14:36.242 --> 14:38.802
- Everyone has.
- Oh, my God!

14:38.878 --> 14:41.847
Out of here! Dr. Cox, please weigh in.

14:41.914 --> 14:45.680
Well, it's no secret how I feel
about surgeons. I hate them.

14:45.784 --> 14:48.480
I'd liken them to rocks,
but that would insult rocks

14:48.554 --> 14:52.081
because, you see, at least rocks
are useful to society.

14:52.157 --> 14:56.457
We build bridges, throw them at guys
wearing phones clipped to their heads.

14:56.528 --> 15:00.191
It's a phone. You can't do this?

15:00.266 --> 15:03.724
- However...
- Now, back to the crux of the matter.

15:03.802 --> 15:05.531
Hit her, Per!

15:05.604 --> 15:08.971
However, it is not Dr. Briggs' fault

15:09.041 --> 15:11.066
that she works in a broken system.

15:11.143 --> 15:13.907
Top hospitals are only
interested in hiring surgeons

15:14.013 --> 15:15.503
who they think are flawless.

15:15.581 --> 15:17.913
That's not the answer you
thought you'd hear,

15:17.983 --> 15:20.645
but as always, I don't care.

15:22.821 --> 15:24.721
Thank God he didn't see this.

15:24.790 --> 15:28.123
Yeah, Mom, I was listening
the whole time. I just couldn't talk.

15:35.601 --> 15:39.765
Looks like somebody took their new
titanium eight iron with a leather grip

15:39.838 --> 15:42.534
and went to town on your van.

15:42.608 --> 15:44.269
Well done, sir.

15:44.343 --> 15:46.709
What? You think I did it?

15:46.812 --> 15:49.474
Too bad you can't prove it.

15:49.548 --> 15:51.277
Really?

15:53.319 --> 15:55.480
<i>I think I need to take more...</i>

15:55.554 --> 15:57.283
<i>... blood.</i>

15:57.356 --> 15:59.324
What the hell is this?

15:59.425 --> 16:02.724
It's Dorian's camera. This must be
a scene from <i>Dr. Acula.</i>

<i>You ain't taking no more blood</i>
<i>from my ho-slapping hand.</i>

<i>And that! And that!</i>

<i>And that! And that!</i>

16:39.231 --> 16:41.324
<i>Yeah!</i>

16:42.267 --> 16:43.962
What do you want?

16:47.573 --> 16:49.541
So, hey, I thought you
might be hungry.

16:49.608 --> 16:52.099
You enjoyed the pancakes
I left on the computer?

16:52.177 --> 16:56.011
No, but I enjoyed the 3,000 ants
crawling on my keyboard.

16:56.081 --> 16:58.049
There's two doing it on the F button.

16:58.150 --> 17:01.085
I could be wrong,
but it looks like two girls.

17:01.153 --> 17:04.316
- What do you want, Elliot?
- I wanted to apologize.

17:04.423 --> 17:06.789
- Well, save it.
- Look, Carla, I...

17:06.858 --> 17:09.224
You must be bored
with this friendship

17:09.294 --> 17:11.353
when all you do
is take, take, take.

17:11.430 --> 17:14.455
The most embarrassing thing is
you don't realize you do it.

17:14.532 --> 17:16.501
Because, at the end of the day,

17:16.568 --> 17:20.265
you're nothing but a spoiled, selfish,
neurotic girl from Connecticut

17:20.339 --> 17:22.397

no idea how to...

17:22.473 --> 17:24.135
OK, that's enough!

17:24.209 --> 17:27.541
I don't know what you are fighting
about, but it doesn't matter.

17:27.613 --> 17:31.743
No one's allowed to be that mean to my
girl, especially when she's apologizing.

17:31.817 --> 17:36.083
- Are we clear?
<i>- [JD] Nobody speaks to Carla like that.</i>

17:46.231 --> 17:48.131
I'm sorry, Elliot.

<i>was that it looked like she had.</i>

17:52.137 --> 17:55.231
- Thanks for standing up for me.
- Yeah, totally.

<i>who Keith really was</i>

You can call me from the road.

My mom loves the road.

I finally figured out
what bothers me so much about you.

18:25.304 --> 18:27.272
Well, lay it on me, studly.

18:27.339 --> 18:31.002
It's the way you're so concerned
about protecting yourself.

18:32.411 --> 18:36.142
I mean, no one in this entire hospital
has a bad thing to say about you,

18:36.215 --> 18:40.777
and I'm guessing that's because you're
careful not to rub anyone the wrong way.

18:41.687 --> 18:44.451
And you still wear your wedding ring.

18:44.523 --> 18:47.822
That prevents any guy
from getting anywhere near you.

18:47.893 --> 18:49.861
You wouldn't operate on Mr. Peters,

18:49.928 --> 18:53.659
and we both know how you're
protecting yourself there.

18:53.732 --> 18:58.169
I don't know. I guess, in the grand
scheme of things, it's not a big deal.

18:58.237 --> 19:01.468
I was a little disappointed to find out
who you turned out to be.

19:03.609 --> 19:05.543
