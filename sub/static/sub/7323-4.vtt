08:54.665 --> 08:56.066
(gasps)

08:56.066 --> 08:58.168
THERE'S MY CURE.

08:58.168 --> 09:01.141
ISN'T HE BEAUTIFUL?

09:01.141 --> 09:03.243
(sighs)

09:12.853 --> 09:14.154
RESEARCH HAS FOUND,

09:14.154 --> 09:16.156
WORMS PRODUCE AN ENZYME
THAT CUT DOWN ON ALLERGIES.

09:16.156 --> 09:18.629
I'M APPLYING THE THEORY
TO ASTHMA.

09:18.629 --> 09:20.130
YOU EAT WORMS?

09:20.130 --> 09:22.793
YANG. HOW LONG DO
THESE EXPERIMENTS LAST?

09:22.793 --> 09:25.836
MM. STANDARD IS
A MONTH OR TWO.

09:25.836 --> 09:28.068
AND THEN I TAKE
THE ANTIPARASITIC TO PASS THEM.
(beeps)

09:28.068 --> 09:32.072
BUT I CAN EXTRACT MORE ENZYME
THE LONGER I GROW THEM.

09:32.072 --> 09:34.975
A YEAR IS PUSHING IT,
APPARENTLY.

09:34.975 --> 09:37.277
YOU'VE HAD THESE WORMS
INSIDE OF YOU FOR A YEAR?

09:37.277 --> 09:39.309
343 DAYS TO BE EXACT.

09:39.309 --> 09:43.183
HAVEN'T HAD AN ASTHMA ATTACK
IN SIX MONTHS.

09:43.183 --> 09:45.956

09:49.189 --> 09:50.961
MY, THEY'VE GROWN.

09:50.961 --> 09:54.094
YOU HAVE A NASTY
BOWEL OBSTRUCTION, MR. FINK.

09:54.094 --> 09:55.666
YOU NEED SURGERY.

09:55.666 --> 09:58.168
OH, NO. THAT WON'T DO.

09:58.168 --> 10:00.170
SURGERY WILL THROW OFF
THE ENTIRE EXPERIMENT.

10:00.170 --> 10:03.333
I'D LIKE ANOTHER OPTION.
SIR. OKAY, I'M SORRY, BUT--

10:03.333 --> 10:07.207
IT'S THREE YEARS RESEARCH,
DR. BAILEY.

10:07.207 --> 10:10.981
RESEARCH YOU'D BE CONTAMINATING
THE MINUTE YOU CUT ME OPEN.

10:10.981 --> 10:13.113
(sighs)

10:13.113 --> 10:15.115
OKAY, DR. YANG'S GONNA
GIVE YOU FLUID

10:15.115 --> 10:17.247
AND PUT AN N.G. TUBE
DOWN YOUR NOSE

10:17.247 --> 10:19.219
TO OPEN THE OBSTRUCTION.

10:19.219 --> 10:22.092
IT WILL BE PAINFUL, AND IF YOU
DON'T IMPROVE IN A FEW HOURS,

10:22.092 --> 10:23.794
YOU'RE GETTING THE SURGERY.

10:23.794 --> 10:25.696
OPTION TWO IT IS THEN.

10:29.960 --> 10:32.102
YOU KNOW HE'S CRAZY,
RIGHT?

10:32.102 --> 10:33.403
CRAZY IS RELATIVE, YANG.

10:33.403 --> 10:35.405
IN FACT, SOME PEOPLE MIGHT SAY

10:35.405 --> 10:38.168
THAT MISSING ROUNDS
THIS MORNING

10:38.168 --> 10:41.041
WHEN I'M CHARGE
IS CRAZY BEHAVIOR, TOO.

10:41.041 --> 10:45.045
BUT HERE I AM, TRUSTING YOU
TO TAKE CARE OF MY PATIENT.

10:45.045 --> 10:47.047
MAYBE I'M THE CRAZY ONE.
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

10:47.047 --> 10:50.180
AM I CRAZY TO TRUST YOU
TO TAKE CARE OF MY PATIENT?

10:50.180 --> 10:51.722
NO.

10:51.722 --> 10:54.084
BUT I HAVEN'T
BEEN SWALLOWING WORMS.

10:54.084 --> 10:55.726

10:55.726 --> 10:57.728
(Alex) WELL,
HIS PAIN IS NOT TOO BAD.

10:57.728 --> 11:01.231
THAT MEANS HIS TUMOR
PROBABLY SHRUNK, RIGHT?

11:01.231 --> 11:04.064

GUESS WHO JUST SCORED A TABLE

11:04.064 --> 11:06.937
AT THAT NEW SUSHI PLACE
THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO GET IN TO?

11:06.937 --> 11:09.199
(Callie) NO WAY.
8:30, TABLE FOR 3.

11:09.199 --> 11:11.671
OH, YOU KNOW, I DON'T--
I DON'T EAT SUSHI.

11:11.671 --> 11:14.674
YEAH, YOU DO.
YEAH, I DID.

11:14.674 --> 11:17.007
I DID, BUT THEN I GOT SICK
AFTER I ATE

11:17.007 --> 11:19.179
ONE OF THOSE PREPACKAGED ROLLS
AT THE CAFETERIA.

11:19.179 --> 11:21.681
BAD MEMORY. (chuckles)
YOU TWO GO.

11:21.681 --> 11:24.254
I'LL CHANGE THE RESERVATION
TO TWO.

11:24.254 --> 11:25.956

11:25.956 --> 11:27.217
WHAT?

11:27.217 --> 11:29.219
MM...

11:29.219 --> 11:31.862
TORRES, YOU SHOULD SEE THIS.

11:31.862 --> 11:33.393
(sighs) GOD.

11:33.393 --> 11:36.696
I HATE THIS JOB SOMETIMES.

11:36.696 --> 11:39.069
LILA, YOUR C.T. SHOWS THAT
YOU HAVE A RUPTURED DIAPHRAGM,

11:39.069 --> 11:41.071
SO YOU'RE GONNA NEED SURGERY.

11:41.071 --> 11:44.204
SO HOW WILL WE PROCEED,
DR. AVERY?

11:44.204 --> 11:47.908
PART OF YOUR STOMACH'S
GONE INTO YOUR CHEST.

11:47.908 --> 11:49.910
SO WE'LL
PLACE YOUR STOMACH BACK

11:49.910 --> 11:52.212
AND REPAIR THE DIAPHRAGM
WITH MESH.

11:52.212 --> 11:53.713
DR. GREY, DO YOU AGREE?

11:53.713 --> 11:56.987
NO, I WOULD DO A DIRECT REPAIR
WITH SUTURE INSTEAD OF MESH

11:56.987 --> 11:59.089
BECAUSE THE DEFECT
IS SO SMALL.

11:59.089 --> 12:00.851
THAT'S RIGHT.

12:00.851 --> 12:02.823
ALL RIGHT, DR. GREY,
DRAW PRE-OP LABS.

12:02.823 --> 12:05.095

12:05.095 --> 12:07.227
LILA, DO YOU NEED US
TO CALL ANYONE FOR YOU?

12:07.227 --> 12:08.929
NO. IT'S JUST ME.

12:08.929 --> 12:11.131
BUT I WOULD LIKE IT
IF HE WOULD WAIT BY MY BEDSIDE.

12:11.131 --> 12:13.463
YEAH, YOU AND EVERY OTHER WOMAN
IN THIS HOSPITAL.

12:13.463 --> 12:16.166
ALL RIGHT.
I'LL SEE YOU IN THE O.R.

12:16.166 --> 12:19.009
THANK YOU.

12:19.009 --> 12:23.113
OH, PLEASE TELL ME YOU'VE GOTTEN
TO MAKE OUT WITH THAT.

12:23.113 --> 12:25.445
NO. MARRIED, SO NO.

12:25.445 --> 12:27.848
THAT'S A BUMMER.

12:27.848 --> 12:29.449

12:29.449 --> 12:32.823
UH, NO,
BUT THINKING ABOUT IT.

12:32.823 --> 12:35.125
UM, DID YOU NEED ME
TO SCRUB IN, TOO?

12:35.125 --> 12:37.127
THE QUESTION SHOULD BE
"MAY I SCRUB IN?"

12:37.127 --> 12:39.159
LIKE YOU WANT TO.

12:39.159 --> 12:41.191
RIGHT. IT'S MAY--MAY I.

12:41.191 --> 12:45.165
NO, I THINK I'VE GOT
ALL THE HANDS I NEED.

12:45.165 --> 12:48.138

12:48.138 --> 12:51.141

12:51.141 --> 12:53.543
OKAY, I'VE BEEN
OFF MY GAME LATELY,

12:53.543 --> 12:55.505
AND YOU'VE SUFFERED
BECAUSE OF IT.

12:55.505 --> 12:59.349
BUT RIGHT NOW, I NEED YOU
TO GIVE ME ANOTHER CHANCE.

12:59.349 --> 13:02.112
OKAY? PLEASE.

13:02.112 --> 13:03.553
I...

13:03.553 --> 13:09.019
LOOK, I WANT TO SCRUB IN,
OKAY?

13:11.491 --> 13:13.263

13:13.263 --> 13:14.564

THAT'S REALLY--

13:35.345 --> 13:37.347
SHE LOST CONTROL
OF HER PARKED CAR,

13:37.347 --> 13:40.120
HAS NO MEMORY OF HOW,
SO I THINK THAT'S NECESSARY,

13:40.120 --> 13:42.923

13:42.923 --> 13:45.125

HOW WOULD YOU FEEL

13:47.998 --> 13:51.101

AT THE HOUSE?

13:51.101 --> 13:52.402

13:52.402 --> 13:55.135
AND I DID ONE WITH REED
AT OUR OLD APARTMENT,

13:55.135 --> 13:57.237

HOW WELL IT WORKS.

13:57.237 --> 13:59.940

LIKE, PERMANENTLY?

13:59.940 --> 14:02.142
WHY? DO--DO YOU THINK
THAT'S NOT OKAY?

14:02.142 --> 14:05.976
(chuckles) SHOULD I TALK
TO MEREDITH ABOUT THAT?
WELL, THAT'S UP TO YOU,

14:05.976 --> 14:07.978

THE CHORE WHEEL.

14:07.978 --> 14:09.980

14:19.329 --> 14:22.592

IZZIE'S ROOM--
NO. NO, NO, NO, IT'S NOT
ABOUT IZZIE'S ROOM.

14:22.592 --> 14:24.965

14:24.965 --> 14:27.367

18:56.866 --> 18:59.339
AND IT HAS NEVER BEEN
A FIRE STATION, RIGHT?

18:59.339 --> 19:02.172
YOU PAGED ME
TO TALK REAL ESTATE?

19:02.172 --> 19:04.744
W--THAT AND I THOUGHT
YOU MIGHT WANT TO OBSERVE.

19:04.744 --> 19:07.747
OUR GUY, HE GOT CAUGHT BETWEEN
A CAR AND WASHING MACHINE,

19:07.747 --> 19:10.850
AND YOU DON'T SEE THAT KIND
OF CRUSH INJURY EVERY DAY,

19:10.850 --> 19:13.283
BUT NO PRESSURE.

19:13.283 --> 19:17.387
THANK YOU,
BUT I HAVE TO MONITOR WORMS.

19:17.387 --> 19:19.329
(Arizona)
A ROTATIONPLASTY?

19:19.329 --> 19:23.263
NO, NO, IT'S NOT POSSIBLE
WITH THIS PART OF THE LEG.

19:23.263 --> 19:25.295
FIBULAR GRAFTING?

19:25.295 --> 19:28.768
OH, NO. CANCER'S SEEDED
TO HIS FIBULA.

19:28.768 --> 19:31.401
♪ DO, DO, DO,
AND WE DO... ♪

19:31.401 --> 19:33.703
(sighs deeply)

19:33.703 --> 19:34.704
WHAT?

19:34.704 --> 19:37.647
YOU DON'T LIKE MARK.
ADMIT IT.

19:37.647 --> 19:39.949
I LIKE MARK.
LIAR.

19:39.949 --> 19:41.511
I LIKE HIM. I DO.

19:41.511 --> 19:44.354
WE'RE JUST, YOU KNOW...
WE'RE DIFFERENT.
(laughs) OH, MY GOD.

19:44.354 --> 19:45.615
HOW ARE YOU DIFFERENT?

19:45.615 --> 19:48.458
TELL ME, 'CAUSE I DON'T--I DON'T
THINK YOU ACTUALLY ARE.

19:48.458 --> 19:49.889
MNH-MNH.
WHAT?

19:49.889 --> 19:52.462
SHOULD I LEAVE?
SHUT IT, KAREV. I'M WAITING.

19:52.462 --> 19:53.593
(laughs)

19:53.593 --> 19:55.465
♪ WHATEVER WE WANT TO DO ♪

19:55.465 --> 19:57.196

19:57.196 --> 19:59.499
IT'S NOT
THAT I DON'T LIKE MARK.
MM-HMM.

19:59.499 --> 20:01.501
IT'S JUST THAT HE'S... MARK.

20:01.501 --> 20:03.903
YOU KNOW, WHAT YOU SEE
IS WHAT YOU GET.

20:03.903 --> 20:05.405
BESIDES, YOU LIKE HIM,

20:05.405 --> 20:07.637
SO WHAT DO I CARE IF HIS ABS
ARE WHERE HIS SOUL SHOULD BE?

20:07.637 --> 20:09.579
(laughs) OH, MY GOD.

20:09.579 --> 20:11.781
FOUND IT!

20:11.781 --> 20:14.314
FOUND IT RIGHT HERE.

20:14.314 --> 20:16.746
WE DON'T HAVE TO
CUT OFF HIS LEG.

20:16.746 --> 20:18.248
(inhales sharply)

20:21.291 --> 20:23.293
PAGE DR. BAILEY
AND BOOK AN O.R.

20:23.293 --> 20:24.824
MM-HMM.
SURGERY? NO, PLEASE.

20:24.824 --> 20:26.996
CAN'T WE WAIT
JUST A LITTLE LONGER?

20:26.996 --> 20:28.998
YOUR BOWEL COULD PERFORATE
AND FILL YOUR ABDOMEN

20:28.998 --> 20:31.431
WITH FECAL MATTER,
SO, NO, WE CANNOT WAIT.

20:31.431 --> 20:34.464
CAN YOU AT LEAST SALVAGE
THE WORMS DURING THE SURGERY?

20:34.464 --> 20:37.467
YOUR LIFE IS AT RISK BECAUSE OF
A HYPOTHESIS YOU CAN'T SUPPORT.

20:37.467 --> 20:39.469
OTHERWISE, YOU WOULD HAVE
THE BACKING

20:39.469 --> 20:41.641
OF AN ACTUAL
ACCREDITED INSTITUTE,

20:41.641 --> 20:43.273
SO LET THE WORMS GO.

20:43.273 --> 20:45.615
I WORKED IN THOSE INSTITUTES
MY WHOLE LIFE.

20:45.615 --> 20:47.277
I SAT IN LABS,

20:47.277 --> 20:49.319
RAN OTHER PEOPLE'S
EXPERIMENTS.

20:49.319 --> 20:51.521
I WAS DEAD INSIDE.

20:51.521 --> 20:53.523
AND NOW FOR THE FIRST TIME,

20:53.523 --> 20:56.386
I KNOW WHAT I'M MEANT TO DO
WITH MY LIFE,

20:56.386 --> 20:58.358
AND EVERYTHING ELSE--
ALL MY QUIRKS, MY FEARS,

20:58.358 --> 21:00.630
THE FACT THAT PEOPLE
FIND ME STRANGE--

21:00.630 --> 21:04.263
NONE OF IT MATTERS
BECAUSE I KNOW WHO I AM.

21:04.263 --> 21:05.695
PLEASE.

21:05.695 --> 21:08.398
SAVE THE WORMS.

21:08.398 --> 21:11.401
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

21:12.772 --> 21:15.445
LET'S GET HIM PREPPED.
(railing clatters)

21:15.445 --> 21:17.447
"STROKE, INFECTION,

21:17.447 --> 21:20.380
HEART ATTACK, SEVERE BLEEDING,
LOSS OF LIFE"?

21:20.380 --> 21:22.752
OH, WHAT THE HELL?

21:22.752 --> 21:24.414
(chuckles)

21:27.717 --> 21:29.889
WHEN DID THE CHOREA START?

21:29.889 --> 21:32.922
CHOREA? I CALL THAT
MY SPASTIC HAND TRICK.

21:32.922 --> 21:34.023
(chuckles)

21:34.023 --> 21:36.426
(sighs)

21:36.426 --> 21:38.428
A FEW MONTHS AGO, I GUESS.

21:38.428 --> 21:42.772
YOU TOLD YOUR DOCTORS?
THEY KNOW, RIGHT?

21:42.772 --> 21:43.933
LILA.

21:43.933 --> 21:46.476
I--NO GUILT TRIP, PLEASE.

21:46.476 --> 21:48.738
I WAS
JUST STARTING TO LIKE YOU.

21:48.738 --> 21:50.680
BUT YOU NEED
TO TELL YOUR DOCTORS,

21:50.680 --> 21:52.642
BECAUSE THEY CAN HELP YOU.

21:52.642 --> 21:54.644
I WATCHED MY MOTHER
GO THROUGH THIS, DR. GREY.

21:54.644 --> 21:56.646
I-I KNOW HOW THIS GOES.

21:56.646 --> 21:58.688
AFTER THE SPASTIC HAND
COMES THE SLURRED SPEECH,

21:58.688 --> 22:02.392
AND THEN THE TROUBLE WALKING,
AND THE DIFFICULTY EATING,

22:02.392 --> 22:04.894
AND THE SEIZURES,
AND THE MEMORY LOSS,

22:04.894 --> 22:07.427
AND THEN THE DEMENTIA
SETS IN SO BADLY

22:07.427 --> 22:11.000
THAT YOU DON'T KNOW
IF YOU'RE IN THE SUPERMARKET

22:11.000 --> 22:12.932
OR THE BATHROOM.

22:12.932 --> 22:16.966
(voice breaking) SO SCREW
GOING TO THE FREAKIN' DOCTOR.

22:16.966 --> 22:20.440
I AM GOING TO BRAZIL.

22:22.772 --> 22:25.915
(knock on door)

22:25.915 --> 22:28.448
AH, DR. GREY.

22:28.448 --> 22:29.749
I CAN USE YOUR INPUT.

22:29.749 --> 22:31.751
DO YOU THINK DEREK
WOULD CONSIDER

22:31.751 --> 22:35.485
PUTTING HIS FACE
ON A BILLBOARD?
OH. THAT'S A LOT OF DEREK.

22:35.485 --> 22:37.857
PRETTY GOOD PICTURE, RIGHT?

22:37.857 --> 22:39.128
MM-HMM.

22:39.128 --> 22:40.860
(sighs)

22:40.860 --> 22:43.393
WHAT DO YOU NEED?

22:43.393 --> 22:45.735
WHEN MY MOTHER
WAS STILL HERE,

22:45.735 --> 22:48.097
BEFORE SHE RETIRED...

22:48.097 --> 22:51.401
DO YOU THINK THAT SHE EVER
TRIED TO TELL YOU

22:51.401 --> 22:53.443
ABOUT THE ALZHEIMER'S?

22:53.443 --> 22:55.144
NO, NO.

22:55.144 --> 22:57.647
SHE KEPT IT A SECRET
FOR YEARS.

22:57.647 --> 23:00.079
NO, I KNOW THAT,
BUT... (stammers)

23:00.079 --> 23:02.412
UM, WHEN DO YOU THINK
IT STARTED?

23:02.412 --> 23:05.415
DO YOU THINK SHE WAS TRYING
TO TELL YOU, AND YOU DIDN'T

23:05.415 --> 23:08.387
REALLY REALIZE THAT'S WHAT SHE
WAS TRYING TO DO, WAS TELL YOU?

23:08.387 --> 23:10.520
WELL, IT'S POSSIBLE,
I GUESS.

23:10.520 --> 23:14.464
UH, AND I DON'T REMEMBER...

23:14.464 --> 23:17.727
IS EVERYTHING OKAY, MEREDITH?

23:17.727 --> 23:20.029
YEAH, IT'S FINE. JUST...

23:22.101 --> 23:24.434
I WOULD NEVER
GO TO A HOSPITAL

23:24.434 --> 23:26.776
THAT PUT ITS DOCTORS
ON BILLBOARDS,

23:26.776 --> 23:28.478
FOR WHAT IT'S WORTH.

23:30.880 --> 23:32.682
(door opens)

23:32.682 --> 23:34.444
(door closes)

23:42.592 --> 23:44.754
HIS B.P. HAS DROPPED
TO 90 OVER 60,

23:44.754 --> 23:46.756
AND HE'S SHOWING SIGNS
OF PERITONITIS.

23:46.756 --> 23:49.058
GOOD WORK, YANG. YOU'RE FREE
TO SCRUB IN IF YOU LIKE,

23:49.058 --> 23:51.060
UH, EVEN JUST TO OBSERVE.

23:51.060 --> 23:56.005
NO ONE'S GONNA MAKE YOU
DO ANYTHING YOU DON'T WANT.

23:56.005 --> 23:59.438
(indistinct conversations)

23:59.438 --> 24:01.511
I'M NOT READY.
(door closes)

24:01.511 --> 24:04.744
THANK YOU, THOUGH,
FOR ASKING.

24:08.047 --> 24:10.720
(indistinct conversations)

24:10.720 --> 24:12.221
(door closes)

24:12.221 --> 24:16.486
OKAY, SO WE'LL TAKE OUT
THE BONE, AND THEN TREAT IT

24:16.486 --> 24:18.488
WITH HIGH DOSES OF RADIATION
TO KILL THE CANCER.

24:18.488 --> 24:21.661
30 MINUTES LATER, WE REINSERT
THE BONE BACK INTO JAKE'S LEG.

24:21.661 --> 24:24.664
USUALLY THE PROCEDURE IS DONE
USING A CADAVER BONE,

24:24.664 --> 24:27.537
SO THERE'S NO RISK OF PUTTING
CANCER BACK IN THE BODY,

24:27.537 --> 24:30.600
BUT WE COULDN'T FIND A MATCH
FOR JAKE ON SUCH SHORT NOTICE.

24:30.600 --> 24:34.504
SO THERE'S A CHANCE
THE CANCER COULD COME BACK?
WELL, THAT'S WHY
AMPUTATION'S LESS RISKY.

24:34.504 --> 24:36.175
BUT IF WE DO THIS,
IF YOU AGREE,

24:36.175 --> 24:39.178
WE WILL MONITOR JAKE CLOSELY,
SCANS EVERY FEW MONTHS,

24:39.178 --> 24:42.181
AND IF THE CANCER RETURNS,
WE'LL DO THE AMPUTATION.

24:42.181 --> 24:44.654
BUT THIS IS DONE A LOT?

24:44.654 --> 24:47.757
UH, IT'S ONLY BEEN DONE
A FEW TIMES IN THE WORLD.

24:47.757 --> 24:50.660
SO IF WE DO THIS,
I MEAN, IF WE SAY YES,

24:50.660 --> 24:52.662
THERE'S A CHANCE
HE'D KEEP HIS LEG FOREVER?

24:52.662 --> 24:55.525
WE HOPE.

25:01.731 --> 25:03.502
IT'S A BIG RISK, BUDDY.

25:03.502 --> 25:06.205
GOD KNOWS, I LOVE
TO WATCH YOU DANCE, BUT...

25:09.609 --> 25:11.681
WHAT WOULD YOU DO?

25:13.543 --> 25:16.115
OH, THAT'S--THAT'S BETWEEN
YOU AND YOUR FOLKS, JAKE.

25:16.115 --> 25:17.617
(Jake) NO.

25:17.617 --> 25:19.118
I WANT TO KNOW.

25:20.620 --> 25:23.022
WHAT WOULD YOU DO?

25:24.724 --> 25:26.856
IF IT WAS MY ARM,
AND, UH,

25:26.856 --> 25:29.699
I COULDN'T OPERATE ANYMORE,
I...

25:29.699 --> 25:33.002
I'D DO EVERYTHING
THAT I COULD TO KEEP IT.

25:38.568 --> 25:40.570
(sighs) WELL, WE'VE RUN
AN E.K.G., C.T.,

25:40.570 --> 25:42.171
AND DONE BLOOD WORK.

25:42.171 --> 25:44.213
FORTUNATELY, THEY'VE ALL
COME BACK NORMAL.

25:44.213 --> 25:46.045
YOU MEAN UNFORTUNATELY.

25:46.045 --> 25:48.047
THEY'RE WAITING
TO TAKE MY STATEMENT.

25:48.047 --> 25:50.950
WELL, IT WAS JUST
AN ACCIDENT, MRS. DAVIS.

25:50.950 --> 25:52.952
YOU PROBABLY JUST PRESSED
THE WRONG PEDAL.

25:52.952 --> 25:55.224
OH, TELL THAT TO THEM.

25:55.224 --> 25:57.226
THEY THROW PEOPLE IN JAIL
ALL THE TIME

25:57.226 --> 25:58.788
FOR THIS SORT OF THING.

25:58.788 --> 26:00.289
(man speaks indistinctly)

26:00.289 --> 26:03.593
THERE IS ANOTHER TEST
WE CAN RUN.
(April) WHAT?

26:03.593 --> 26:05.094
IT'S CALLED A TILT TEST.

26:05.094 --> 26:08.097
IT CAN TELL US IF YOU FAINTED
BEFORE THE ACCIDENT.

26:08.097 --> 26:10.099
WE'LL SCHEDULE IT RIGHT AWAY.

26:10.099 --> 26:12.602
(April) DID YOU GET APPROVAL
FOR A TILT TEST?

26:12.602 --> 26:15.004
NO.
OKAY, WELL, I HATE
TO PULL RANK HERE,

26:15.004 --> 26:17.346
BUT I AM A YEAR AHEAD OF YOU--
WE'RE AT WORK, APRIL,
THERE'S NO CHORE WHEEL.

26:17.346 --> 26:22.211
IF I WANT TO RUN A TILT TEST,
I'M GONNA RUN A TILT TEST.

26:22.211 --> 26:23.883
(scoffs)

26:23.883 --> 26:25.214
I'D THROW A PARTY.

26:25.214 --> 26:27.216
FLY EVERYONE
TO AN AMAZING BEACH,

26:27.216 --> 26:28.918
ALL EXPENSES PAID.

26:28.918 --> 26:31.691
I MEAN, I'D HAVE TO
MAX OUT MY CREDIT CARDS

26:31.691 --> 26:34.193
IN ORDER TO PAY FOR IT,
BUT WHAT DO I CARE?

26:34.193 --> 26:36.626
I WOULDN'T BE AROUND TO
HAVE TO PAY IT OFF. SUCTION.

26:36.626 --> 26:39.198
I'D DO WHAT LILA DID.
I'D QUIT, SELL THE HOUSE,

26:39.198 --> 26:41.971
AND BUM AROUND THE GLOBE.
AND HOW WOULD DEREK FEEL
ABOUT THAT?

26:41.971 --> 26:43.973
AH, HE COULD COME ALONG
IF HE WANTED.

26:43.973 --> 26:45.134
(laughs)

26:45.134 --> 26:47.136
THERE'S SOMETHING SAD
ABOUT THAT, THOUGH.

26:47.136 --> 26:48.808
WANDERING AROUND,
LIVING IN HOTELS--

26:48.808 --> 26:50.710
THAT'S--THAT'S NOT A LIFE.

26:50.710 --> 26:53.342
THIS, THOUGH, EVEN IF
I WAS GONNA DIE TOMORROW,

26:53.342 --> 26:56.816
I'D STILL WANT TO DO IT.

26:56.816 --> 26:59.048
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

26:59.048 --> 27:02.351
CAN I TRY
THE DIAPHRAGM REPAIR?

27:04.323 --> 27:05.695
WHAT?

27:05.695 --> 27:07.797
THE REPAIR, CAN I...

27:07.797 --> 27:11.030
CAN I TRY IT?

27:12.732 --> 27:16.005
UH, N--
UH, NO, NO, YOU CAN'T.

27:16.005 --> 27:19.338
I'M--I'M GOOD, THOUGH.
THANK YOU.

27:21.210 --> 27:24.313
(stapler thunks)

27:24.313 --> 27:29.348
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

27:29.348 --> 27:31.881
(monitor beeping erratically)

27:31.881 --> 27:35.384
OH, HE'S HYPERTENSIVE.
GET HIS PRESSURE BACK UP.

27:35.384 --> 27:37.857
OKAY, GET SOME SALINE
IN HERE QUICK. CLAMP.

27:37.857 --> 27:40.860
I NEED MORE IRRIGATION
IN HERE NOW.
(woman) RIGHT AWAY.

27:40.860 --> 27:42.431
DR. BAILEY,
WHAT'S WRONG?

27:42.431 --> 27:44.293
HE'S PERFORATED.

27:44.293 --> 27:46.936
I HAVE TO EVACUATE
THIS ABSCESS. SUCTION.

27:46.936 --> 27:49.268
(woman) SUCTION.
CAN'T YOU
JUST USE ANTIBIOTICS?

27:49.268 --> 27:51.701
IF I WANT TO RISK
LOSING HIM.

27:51.701 --> 27:53.703
HE NEEDS HIS WORMS BACK
FOR HIS RESEARCH.

27:53.703 --> 27:55.775
THE SUCTION WILL DESTROY THEM.

27:55.775 --> 27:58.207
LOOK, I'M CONCERNED ABOUT
HIS LIFE RIGHT NOW, DR. YANG,

27:58.207 --> 28:01.280
NOT HIS RESEARCH. SUCTION.

28:03.052 --> 28:06.055
(suction gurgling)

28:07.757 --> 28:09.388
(gurgling continues)

28:18.167 --> 28:20.169
(Callie) YOU DID REALLY GOOD
WITH THIS KID TODAY, KAREV.

28:20.169 --> 28:21.831
IMPRESSIVE, WHICH IS FUNNY,

28:21.831 --> 28:23.332
'CAUSE I WOULDN'T THINK

28:23.332 --> 28:26.976
THAT YOU'D BE GOOD IN PEDS
JUST BY LOOKING AT YOU.

28:26.976 --> 28:29.708
OKAY, FINE.
I DON'T LIKE MARK... AT ALL.

28:29.708 --> 28:31.210
THERE. I SAID IT.

28:31.210 --> 28:33.712
'CAUSE YOU NEVER EVEN TRIED.
UGH.

28:33.712 --> 28:35.885
TAKE JAKE HERE.
YOU THINK HIS DAD WAS HAPPY

28:35.885 --> 28:39.248
WHEN JAKE WANTED BALLET SHOES
FOR CHRISTMAS AND NOT CLEATS?

28:39.248 --> 28:42.291
NO, THIS GUY WANTED A KID
HE COULD THROW A BALL WITH,

28:42.291 --> 28:45.024
YOU KNOW HE DID,
BUT HIS SON LOVED TO DANCE,

28:45.024 --> 28:48.027
SO HE SIGNED HIM UP
FOR LESSONS, WENT TO RECITALS,

28:48.027 --> 28:51.360
LEARNED WHAT THERE WAS
TO LOVE ABOUT BALLET.

28:51.360 --> 28:53.132
HE TRIED...

28:53.132 --> 28:55.064
BECAUSE HE LOVED HIS KID.

28:55.064 --> 28:57.136
(sets down saw)

28:57.136 --> 29:00.269
MARK STARES AT MY BOOBS
WHEN WE TALK.
(laughs)

29:00.269 --> 29:03.342
HE STARTS WITH MY FACE, BUT THEN
SOMEWHERE ALONG THE WAY,

29:03.342 --> 29:06.115

I LOVE THEM.

29:08.117 --> 29:11.120
BUT I HAVE TRIED MY WHOLE LIFE
TO AVOID THE BOOB-STARING GUY.

29:11.120 --> 29:13.122
BIOLOGY EVEN HELPED ME
BY MAKING ME GAY.

29:13.122 --> 29:15.124
BUT NOW MY GIRLFRIEND'S
BEST FRIEND IS THAT GUY.

29:15.124 --> 29:17.927
AND I DON'T THINK THAT I NEED
TO APOLOGIZE FOR THE FACT

29:17.927 --> 29:20.529
THAT THE ONLY PERSON I WANT
STARING AT MY BOOBS IS YOU.
BOOBS, REALLY?

29:20.529 --> 29:23.793
YOU'RE MAKING THIS
ABOUT BOOBS?
HE STARES AT THEM.

29:23.793 --> 29:26.395
'CAUSE THEY'RE GOOD BOOBS.
CAN I LEAVE NOW?

29:26.395 --> 29:27.967

LARRY LEFT ME
THREE MONTHS AGO.

29:59.899 --> 30:03.272
HE SAID HE NEEDED TIME
TO HIMSELF TO THINK.

30:03.272 --> 30:07.276

HE'S LIVING WITH SOMEONE ELSE.

30:07.276 --> 30:11.280
HER NAME'S KIMMY.

30:11.280 --> 30:15.244

30:15.244 --> 30:17.446

A BOTTLE OF DETERGENT.

30:33.332 --> 30:35.364

30:36.936 --> 30:39.468

HE WAS INSIDE

30:39.468 --> 30:42.271

30:42.271 --> 30:45.214
HOT PINK PANTIES...
