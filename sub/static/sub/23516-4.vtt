06:40.066 --> 06:43.528
The increase in violence
kept going up little by little,

06:43.611 --> 06:49.408
especially in zones
where these drugs are produced

06:49.826 --> 06:55.915
and in the border areas where they cross
into the United States.

11:32.400 --> 11:38.239
<i>Money crosses continuously</i>
<i>from the United States into Mexico</i>

11:38.322 --> 11:41.200
<i>that is a product of drug sales.</i>

11:41.283 --> 11:45.454
<i>This creates a big problem</i>
<i>for criminal groups because</i>

11:45.538 --> 11:51.377
they can't just arrive at a bank
with a truck full of drug money.

13:24.637 --> 13:27.097
Take the cash... or take a bullet.

13:27.890 --> 13:29.016
It's your choice.

14:37.710 --> 14:44.383
Banco Bital had a great presence
in Mexican territory prior to this,

14:44.466 --> 14:50.139
<i>particularly in Sinaloa,</i>
<i>which is an area of drug production.</i>

14:50.222 --> 14:53.100
Large amounts of money

14:53.183 --> 14:56.687
<i>were coming into the bank</i>
<i>without any form of control.</i>

14:56.770 --> 14:58.355
There was no monitoring.

38:32.810 --> 38:36.564
In London, analysts are saying
the bank can easily absorb this cost.

38:36.647 --> 38:39.442
They made profits of $38 billion
the last two years.

38:39.525 --> 38:41.110
Is it really that significant?

38:41.944 --> 38:43.446
Are we really
holding the bank accountable?

38:53.664 --> 38:55.166
They don't deserve that?

39:07.053 --> 39:10.097
If the Sinaloa cartel had agreed not to do
any more drug smuggling,

39:10.181 --> 39:12.558
would you also defer prosecution
in their case?

42:34.969 --> 42:37.388
You don't think the bank got off easy?
