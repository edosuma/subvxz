01:33.135 --> 01:35.886
They call them
"the haunted shores"...

01:35.887 --> 01:38.556
these stretches of Devonshire
and Cornwall and Ireland...

01:38.557 --> 01:41.434
which rear up against
the westward ocean.

01:41.435 --> 01:46.355
Mists gather here, and sea
fog, and eerie stories.

01:46.356 --> 01:50.359
That's not because there are more ghosts
here than in other places, mind you.

01:50.360 --> 01:55.156
It's just that people who live
hereabouts are strangely aware of them.

01:55.157 --> 01:58.534
You see, day and night,
year in, year out...

01:58.535 --> 02:01.996
they listen to the pound
and stir of the waves.

02:01.997 --> 02:04.832
There's life and death
in that restless sound...

02:04.833 --> 02:07.293
and eternity too.

02:07.294 --> 02:10.963
If you listen to it long enough,
all your senses are sharpened.

02:10.964 --> 02:13.424
You come by strange instincts.

02:13.425 --> 02:17.595
You get to recognize a peculiar cold...
which is the first warning.

02:17.596 --> 02:21.057
A cold which is no mere matter
of degrees Fahrenheit...

02:21.058 --> 02:25.811
but a draining of warmth from the
vital centers of the living.

02:25.812 --> 02:28.230
Local people tell me they
would have felt it...

02:28.231 --> 02:31.817
even outside that locked door.
We didn't.

02:31.818 --> 02:34.195
They can't understand why we
didn't know what it meant...

02:34.196 --> 02:36.781
when our dog wouldn't
go up those stairs.

02:36.782 --> 02:40.102
Animals see the blasted
things, it appears.

02:40.994 --> 02:44.538
Well, my sister Pamela and I knew
nothing about such matters...

02:44.539 --> 02:46.040
not then, we didn't.

02:46.041 --> 02:48.084
We had the disadvantage
of being Londoners...

02:48.085 --> 02:50.836
just down for a fortnight's rest.

02:50.837 --> 02:55.192
That tenth day of May 1937
was the end of our holiday.

03:07.396 --> 03:09.897
We seem to be in somebody's garden.

03:09.898 --> 03:14.443
What was somebody's garden.
What a marvelous old house!

03:14.444 --> 03:16.487
We'd better get out before
we're had up for trespassing.

03:16.488 --> 03:20.764
- Where on earth did we leave the car?
- That direction, I think.

03:31.503 --> 03:33.526
Look, a squirrel.

03:34.131 --> 03:36.859
- Grab Bobby!
- Too late. Bobby, come back here!

03:38.468 --> 03:41.572
- You bad dog!
- Bobby!

03:48.645 --> 03:51.647
He's got the poor little
squirrel trapped. He'll kill it.

03:51.648 --> 03:55.673
My dear, sweet sister, it's more likely
he's having his way with our Bobby.

04:01.700 --> 04:05.100
Fine way to spend a holiday...
chasing a dog!

04:14.838 --> 04:18.033
- Where is he?
- Under here, I think.

04:20.552 --> 04:21.886
I thought you had him.

04:21.887 --> 04:23.888
He had me. There he goes!
Hang on to Bobby!

04:23.889 --> 04:25.457
I can't!

04:34.232 --> 04:36.209
Oh, well played, sir!

04:39.112 --> 04:42.933
- Do you suppose he can get out?
- Certainly. He's on the roof by now.

04:44.201 --> 04:47.995
That's a smart dog.
He'll be back any minute.

04:47.996 --> 04:50.247
Rick, have you noticed anything?

04:50.248 --> 04:52.374
Only that I'm in no shape
to join the hunting set.

04:52.375 --> 04:57.276
No, I mean this house. It's the
loveliest thing I ever saw.

04:58.256 --> 05:02.551
- Look at that staircase.
- Oh, boy, what banisters for sliding!

05:02.552 --> 05:04.553
- Oh, Rick.
- What is it?

05:04.554 --> 05:08.474
Your saying that, and the
house... it took me back.

05:08.475 --> 05:11.393
- Yeah, it's quite a bit like the...
- The rose bowl there...

05:11.394 --> 05:13.854
the grandfather clock there...

05:13.855 --> 05:17.066
and Mother in her best gray
moire sweeping down the stairs.

05:17.067 --> 05:19.985
- You'll be howling in a minute. Come out.
- Not on your life.

05:19.986 --> 05:24.031
I'm going to see the rest of this.
Come on. Let's pretend we're buying it.

05:24.032 --> 05:26.033
I'll toss you for the
bedroom with the best view.

05:26.034 --> 05:28.762
They've all got best views.

05:30.247 --> 05:33.791
How lovely! Why does it
make me feel I'm on a boat?

05:33.792 --> 05:37.962
It's the light on the ceiling. That's the
sea. It's nice to wake up and see that.

05:37.963 --> 05:40.631
Oh, how I do hate living
in a London flat.

05:40.632 --> 05:43.843
If you're brought up in an old
house, you always hanker for one.

05:43.844 --> 05:46.572
It's stuck. You try it.

05:49.599 --> 05:52.184
It's locked. Family
skeletons, probably.

05:52.185 --> 05:54.436
Oh, what a bore.

05:54.437 --> 05:56.631
Rick, the bathroom!

05:59.025 --> 06:03.050
An open fire while you bathe.
What luxury!

06:04.531 --> 06:06.949
You know, this is a
Saturday-night-only bathroom.

06:06.950 --> 06:11.161
You boiled yourself as red as a lobster,
then hurried to bed to avoid a chill.

06:11.162 --> 06:13.080
- Rick.
- What?

06:13.081 --> 06:16.500
I've had one of my feelings.
We're really going to buy this house.

06:16.501 --> 06:19.753
Oh, yes? Did your feeling tell you
what we're going to buy it with?

06:19.754 --> 06:23.173
If we both put in everything
we have, maybe we can get it.

06:23.174 --> 06:27.094
It's terribly out of the way, and
it hasn't been lived in for years.

06:27.095 --> 06:31.098
But what would we do with it? We can't
drive nearly 300 miles just for weekends.

06:31.099 --> 06:34.685
We'll live here all the time,
and you'll work at your music.

06:34.686 --> 06:37.605
My poor lunatic sister,
I happen to have a job.

06:37.606 --> 06:39.773
Yes, and what a job...
going to concerts...

06:39.774 --> 06:42.568
and telling your readers
how bad the music was.

06:42.569 --> 06:45.070
It's not good enough,
Rick. Chuck it.

06:45.071 --> 06:48.073
Down here you'd write your own music,
as you always should have done...

06:48.074 --> 06:50.117
and as you've always wanted to.

06:50.118 --> 06:53.704
Rick, it isn't as if you were
even a good music critic.

06:53.705 --> 06:57.124
Well, thank you very much.
Anyway, I get paid hard cash.

06:57.125 --> 07:00.377
Well, doesn't the idea
attract you at all?

07:00.378 --> 07:02.004
Attract me?

07:02.005 --> 07:04.465
Look, you come out of here.
You're dangerous.

07:04.466 --> 07:08.010
Don't you know how rare
houses like this are?

07:08.011 --> 07:11.138
- I like the banisters.
- How Lizzie'd love that kitchen.

07:11.139 --> 07:13.307
That little beach
must belong to it.

07:13.308 --> 07:15.643
It's in good condition too.
Not a sign of damp.

07:15.644 --> 07:18.604
- We'll get our furniture out of storage
- Be calm, Pamela.

07:18.605 --> 07:20.564
A change like this would have
to be discussed for months.

07:20.565 --> 07:24.026
Nonsense. Important decisions
have to be made quickly.

07:24.027 --> 07:26.987
Well, my paper has asked
me to do a series...

07:26.988 --> 07:29.657
"Lives of the great musicians."
Reading time: two minutes.

07:29.658 --> 07:32.910
- There you are. That'll feed us.
- Yes, until I run out of musicians.

07:32.911 --> 07:35.204
Anyway, how do we know
the place is for sale?

07:35.205 --> 07:38.900
Rick, life isn't as cruel
as that. It's got to be.

07:47.175 --> 07:49.218
Now remember, Pam, no
signs of keenness.

07:49.219 --> 07:52.323
We're just mildly
interested. Mildly.

07:54.516 --> 07:56.350
- Good afternoon.
- Good afternoon.

07:56.351 --> 07:58.936
We'd like to see Commander
Beech, if we may.

07:58.937 --> 08:02.606
- He's not in at the moment.
- Could we wait for him?

08:02.607 --> 08:04.675
Won't you come in?

08:13.785 --> 08:15.869
There's a fire in the study.

08:15.870 --> 08:19.691
I think I can catch my
grandfather by telephone.

08:21.960 --> 08:25.129
- Who shall I say wants to see him?
- He wouldn't know our name.

08:25.130 --> 08:28.924
It's Fitzgerald. My sister, Pamela
Fitzgerald, and I'm Roderick Fitzgerald.

08:28.925 --> 08:30.217
- How do you do?
- How do you do?

08:30.218 --> 08:33.136
I'm Stella Meredith.
Won't you sit down?

08:33.138 --> 08:34.804
Thank you.

08:34.806 --> 08:39.001
Oh, not in that chair!
It's got a lumpy seat.

08:41.520 --> 08:43.589
- Do you mind?
- Oh, no.

08:45.525 --> 08:48.610
- Oh, dear. Will this do?
- Thank you.

08:48.611 --> 08:51.405
We're an awfully un-smoking house.

08:51.406 --> 08:55.701
Grandfather had a cigar blown straight down
his throat once when he was on the foredeck.

08:55.702 --> 08:57.725
He lost his taste for tobacco.

08:59.039 --> 09:00.831
Can I help in any way?

09:00.832 --> 09:03.500
We wanted to talk to the commander
about a house he owns...

09:03.501 --> 09:05.419
on top of the cliff.

09:05.420 --> 09:06.754
- Windward?
- Yes.

09:06.755 --> 09:10.632
You see, we've fallen head
over heels in love with...

09:10.633 --> 09:13.761
- I mean, it might just do for us.
- Really?

09:13.762 --> 09:16.430
We understand from Mrs. Brown
at the inn ifs for sale.

09:16.431 --> 09:21.435
Mrs. Brown is mistaken. Sorry you've
been put to the trouble of coming here.

09:21.436 --> 09:24.021
Perhaps if we could speak to
your grandfather about it...

09:24.022 --> 09:26.023
It wouldn't be the slightest use.

09:26.024 --> 09:28.776
I'm sorry, but there's really
no point in your waiting.

09:28.777 --> 09:31.005
Stella, are you there?

09:32.363 --> 09:34.573
Yes, Grandfather.

09:34.574 --> 09:36.551
In here.

09:42.165 --> 09:44.166
Well, what is it?

09:44.167 --> 09:47.002
Some people who came here
by mistake, Grandfather.

09:47.003 --> 09:48.170
They're just leaving.

09:48.171 --> 09:50.380
We heard that Windward
House is for sale.

09:50.381 --> 09:52.758
Yes, it is.

09:52.759 --> 09:55.260
Won't you sit down?
I'll be with you in a moment.

09:55.261 --> 09:57.534
Thank you very much.

10:02.268 --> 10:03.560
Grandfather, please.

10:03.561 --> 10:06.730
I thought I made myself quite
clear on this point, Stella.

10:06.731 --> 10:09.858
- Yes, Grandfather...
- I don't understand you.

10:09.859 --> 10:12.319
A house you haven't lived in
since you were a child...

10:12.320 --> 10:14.863
a piece of property we
can't afford to maintain.

10:14.864 --> 10:17.533
But it was my
mother's house. It's...

10:17.534 --> 10:20.994
- I can't put it into words. It's...
- Nonsense.

10:20.995 --> 10:23.189
Grandfather, please!

10:42.725 --> 10:45.519
I don't believe many
repairs will be necessary.

10:45.520 --> 10:47.229
The roof is sound...

10:47.230 --> 10:50.607
and the walls have withstood the
Atlantic gales for two centuries.

10:50.608 --> 10:52.151
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

10:52.152 --> 10:56.113
There was a considerable sum spent
on the house some 20 years ago...

10:56.114 --> 11:01.118
- when I gave it to my daughter.
- I understand. Well, I'm sorry...

11:01.119 --> 11:04.788
but I'm afraid £1,200
is our absolute limit.

11:04.789 --> 11:07.166
- Is that a definite offer?
- Yes.

11:07.167 --> 11:09.960
And you would pay the
entire sum immediately?

11:09.961 --> 11:12.530
- You mean you'd sell for that?
- Yes.

11:15.341 --> 11:18.177
I suppose you ought to have the
property surveyed before we...

11:18.178 --> 11:21.138
- Oh, Rick.
- There's no need to get suspicious.

11:21.139 --> 11:23.599
The house is worth far
more than that...

11:23.600 --> 11:26.018
but I have a very young
granddaughter...

11:26.019 --> 11:29.479
and £1,200 in the bank for her
would ease my mind considerably.

11:29.480 --> 11:31.799
We understand perfectly.

11:32.609 --> 11:34.985
And you'd not be nervous
in such a lonely house?

11:34.986 --> 11:36.820
No, indeed.

11:36.821 --> 11:41.116
Or of the wind at nights?
It plays odd tricks in old houses.

11:41.117 --> 11:43.076
Are you trying to tell us
the house is haunted?

11:43.077 --> 11:46.272
No, Miss Fitzgerald.
No house is haunted.

11:46.748 --> 11:51.793
But I had some tenants five years ago
who complained of... disturbances.

11:51.794 --> 11:55.255
What was the trouble? Ladies carrying
their heads under their arms?

11:55.256 --> 11:58.258
I declined to discuss it
and canceled the lease.

11:58.259 --> 12:02.262
- But I couldn't cancel a sale.
- We wouldn't want you to.

12:02.263 --> 12:05.682
One does feel that a story like
that should bring the price down.

12:05.683 --> 12:09.853
I've already made a very considerable
reduction, Mr. Fitzgerald.

12:09.854 --> 12:12.105
Perhaps we both need time
to think the matter over.

12:12.106 --> 12:15.567
- But our offer's definite. Isn't it, Rick?
- Oh, yes.

12:15.568 --> 12:17.762
Very well, then. I accept it.

12:18.780 --> 12:22.407
Title deeds and checks will be
exchanged by our solicitors.

12:22.408 --> 12:27.184
In the meantime, I have your
word, and you have mine.

12:27.956 --> 12:32.106
Well, it's wonderfully simple
to buy a house, isn't it?

12:35.588 --> 12:40.114
- Pam, where are you?
- Here I am. Look, our own roses.

12:45.431 --> 12:48.183
Rick, it's all ours.
Isn't it wonderful?

12:48.184 --> 12:50.310
You know, it's bigger
than I thought.

12:50.311 --> 12:52.771
I can't wait to see what's
in that Bluebeard room.

12:52.772 --> 12:57.776
Probably the housemaid's cupboard.
Slops, mops, dripping taps.

12:57.777 --> 13:00.612
I wonder how soon we can get
cleaners and painters in.

13:00.613 --> 13:03.448
You'll go back to London,
of course, while I stay here.

13:03.449 --> 13:05.325
Rolled up in a blanket
like a squaw?

13:05.326 --> 13:09.431
At the inn, idiot, until
you ship me the furniture.

13:11.582 --> 13:14.001
Did the old boy tell
you why it was locked?

13:14.002 --> 13:16.480
Never thought to ask him.

13:21.509 --> 13:24.469
Well, now we know.

13:24.470 --> 13:28.557
- It's the one ugly room in the house.
- Oh, it's not so bad.

13:28.558 --> 13:31.518
That window, it's like
a cucumber frame.

13:31.519 --> 13:33.729
They put that in later to
make a painter's studio.

13:33.730 --> 13:37.441
Even the view doesn't cheer it up.

13:37.442 --> 13:40.027
- What'll we do with it?
- My workroom, of course.

13:40.028 --> 13:43.322
It's ideal. Put the piano over
there with shelves for music...

13:43.323 --> 13:46.616
plenty of space to walk up and down,
manuscripts all over the floor...

13:46.617 --> 13:50.120
hot pincers to tear the flesh from people
who keep telling me luncheon is ready...

13:50.121 --> 13:52.940
stacks of checks from
my publishers, and...

13:53.875 --> 13:57.753
- Do you think this room is damp?
- It needs airing.

13:57.754 --> 14:00.797
It's funny it should strike so cold
in here after such a warm day.

14:00.798 --> 14:03.572
- Oh, law.
- What, Rick?

14:04.844 --> 14:08.347
I suddenly felt
completely flattened.

14:08.348 --> 14:11.266
Do you suppose I'll ever be able to
write any music here or anywhere?

14:11.267 --> 14:13.977
What on earth are
you talking about?

14:13.978 --> 14:17.147
You don't suppose we've made the
most howling mistake, do you?

14:17.148 --> 14:19.399
Rick, have we?

14:19.400 --> 14:22.235
Why did the commander suddenly
come down in his price like that?

14:22.236 --> 14:25.697
The disturbances. Rumors like that
are dynamite if you're selling a place.

14:25.698 --> 14:30.118
Yes. Pamela, you're not going to get
scared of this ghost business, are you?

14:30.119 --> 14:33.372
Of course not, Rick. I don't
believe in them, really...

14:33.373 --> 14:36.708
and I'd be interested,
not scared, wouldn't you?

14:36.709 --> 14:41.189
Me? No, disturbances wouldn't disturb
me, not for a single second.

14:43.966 --> 14:46.343
- It's Bobby!
- Of course it's Bobby.

14:46.344 --> 14:49.118
Now don't go getting imaginative.

14:49.555 --> 14:52.204
It is rather a filthy
room, isn't it?

14:53.267 --> 14:55.936
We're here, Bobby.

14:55.937 --> 14:58.688
He's trying to tell us about
the squirrel, I expect.

14:58.689 --> 15:03.590
- Didn't he keep his date with you?
- Why don't you come up, stupid?

15:04.987 --> 15:07.322
Rick, look at that
lamb of a window!

15:07.323 --> 15:09.596
Never thought Bobby
was a killer at heart.

15:12.537 --> 15:14.746
Who's that standing out there?

15:14.747 --> 15:17.771
Looks like the old
boy's granddaughter.

15:21.754 --> 15:23.713
Don't waste a wave on that one.

15:23.714 --> 15:26.007
Because she didn't want
us to buy the house?

15:26.008 --> 15:28.885
- I think she'd been crying.
- Had she?

15:28.886 --> 15:30.220
Don't you see?

15:30.221 --> 15:33.181
She adored the house,
and we've cast her out.

15:33.182 --> 15:35.809
- Isn't it awful?
- Stop making up stories.

15:35.810 --> 15:38.270
She didn't live here.
She just doesn't want us to.

15:38.271 --> 15:40.772
She's an ill-mannered
little dog in the manger.

15:40.773 --> 15:43.817
All right, Bobby. We'll
take you back to the inn...

15:43.818 --> 15:45.777
and let you order your dinner.

15:45.778 --> 15:48.176
Have you forgotten something?

15:52.410 --> 15:58.313
No. On second thought, my landing
gear isn't what it used to be.

16:32.408 --> 16:34.326
- Morning, sir.
- Morning.

16:34.327 --> 16:36.896
- Twenty Turrets, please.
- Yes, sir.

16:38.789 --> 16:42.292
- Isn't this Windward House?
- Yes, sir. Fine house too.

16:42.293 --> 16:44.586
Glad to hear there'll
be folk in it again.

16:44.587 --> 16:48.157
- You have a dozen of these?
- Likely I have.

16:49.217 --> 16:51.801
Oh, maybe you're the new owner.

16:51.802 --> 16:53.970
Yes, my sister and I bought
the place yesterday.

16:53.971 --> 16:57.766
Well, well. I hope you'll bring
it back to itself again.

16:57.767 --> 17:00.769
The last lot that lived
there weren't no good.

17:00.770 --> 17:03.063
Went away owing money.

17:03.064 --> 17:06.441
Got out of their lease starting
ugly stories about the place.

17:06.442 --> 17:09.569
- So that's how the rumors started.
- That's what I do say.

17:09.569 --> 17:12.948
Here you are, sir. Nine
seems to be all I have.

17:12.949 --> 17:15.909
- That's all right.
- Of course, there are others say different.

17:15.910 --> 17:18.411
- There are?
- Well, that's only natural...

17:18.412 --> 17:21.957
after the way the lady of
Windward House died...

17:21.958 --> 17:25.085
- God rest her soul.
- You mean the commander's daughter?

17:25.086 --> 17:28.630
Only child. Come near breaking
the old gentleman's heart.

17:28.631 --> 17:31.424
- He's never been the same since.
- How did she die?

17:31.425 --> 17:33.885
- Fell off the cliff.
- Accident?

17:33.886 --> 17:36.346
That's what I do say.

17:36.347 --> 17:38.431
Good morning, Mr. Hardy.

17:38.432 --> 17:41.851
- A copy of Amateur Gardening, please.
- Yes, Mrs. Coatesworthy.

17:41.852 --> 17:43.812
Well, the best of luck to you, sir.

17:43.813 --> 17:46.773
If you have a favorite tobacco,
I'll be glad to stock it.

17:46.774 --> 17:48.692
Thank you. Good-bye.

17:48.693 --> 17:51.236
The gent that just
bought Windward House.

17:51.237 --> 17:53.135
You don't say.

17:57.535 --> 17:59.995
- Mr. Fitzgerald?
- Yes?

17:59.996 --> 18:02.872
- Oh, it's you.
- May I speak to you for a moment?

18:02.873 --> 18:04.624
Look here, young lady...

18:04.625 --> 18:07.836
if you want to talk me out of
Windward House, save your breath.

18:07.837 --> 18:10.922
It isn't that. It's about
me, yesterday afternoon.

18:10.923 --> 18:12.966
My behavior was inexcusable.

18:12.967 --> 18:16.553
- Come now. It wasn't as bad as all that.
- Thank you very much.

18:16.554 --> 18:18.555
Your grandfather made you
apologize, didn't he?

18:18.556 --> 18:20.932
Oh, no. It was my mother.

18:20.933 --> 18:22.684
Your moth...

18:22.685 --> 18:25.312
But I understood that...
I beg your pardon?

18:25.313 --> 18:28.773
I kept looking at her last night,
thinking how I'd let her down.

18:28.774 --> 18:31.693
- But isn't your mother dead?
- Yes, but I know all about her.

18:31.694 --> 18:35.280
From Grandfather, of course.
I was only three when she died.

18:35.281 --> 18:36.990
But I thought you said
you looked at her.

18:36.991 --> 18:39.993
Her portrait hangs in my room.
My father painted it.

18:39.994 --> 18:44.998
- Oh, then it was his studio.
- Yes, and she was so beautiful.

18:44.999 --> 18:47.318
Let's go for a walk.

18:50.212 --> 18:52.464
Grandfather will never
get over her death.

18:52.465 --> 18:55.717
- He's hated Windward ever since.
- That's understandable.

18:55.718 --> 18:59.846
But it isn't fair to hate a house
because someone's died there.

18:59.847 --> 19:03.183
I love Windward because she
lived there for three years...

19:03.184 --> 19:04.643
and those were my years.

19:04.644 --> 19:07.646
And that's why you don't want
anyone else to live in it?

19:07.647 --> 19:10.940
- That's foolish, isn't it?
- No, just one thing is foolish:

19:10.941 --> 19:13.610
You're living somebody else's life.

19:13.611 --> 19:16.404
- How old are you, Stella Meredith?
- Twenty.

19:16.405 --> 19:18.490
You're 20, and you're pretty.

19:18.491 --> 19:22.452
You shouldn't be wasting a single second
looking back on three little years.

19:22.453 --> 19:24.204
- You should be having fun.
- I am.

19:24.205 --> 19:27.040
Oh, nonsense! What are you
doing today, for instance?

19:27.041 --> 19:30.752
- Oh, just things.
- Facts, details.

19:30.753 --> 19:34.673
Oh, dear. I've got
to match some wool.

19:34.674 --> 19:38.176
Then I have to stop at the library
and get a copy of Bleak House.

19:38.177 --> 19:39.928
Grandfather and I are
reading Dickens.

19:39.929 --> 19:44.330
You're not going to do any of those
things. I have a much better idea.

19:53.234 --> 19:56.111
Isn't this better than
reading to Grandfather?

19:56.112 --> 19:59.887
- Oh, it's wonderful.
- Ever get seasick?

20:01.075 --> 20:03.785
Fortunately, I have a
stomach like Gibraltar.

20:03.786 --> 20:06.105
Not externally, of course.

20:07.998 --> 20:10.250
- Are you asleep?
- No.

20:10.251 --> 20:14.697
Just wondering if our national
confidence in Gibraltar isn't misplaced.

20:22.430 --> 20:24.681
Shouldn't you get out of the sun?

20:24.682 --> 20:26.641
No, I'd...

20:26.642 --> 20:28.685
I'd rather...

20:28.686 --> 20:30.687
remain here.

20:30.688 --> 20:33.962
Oh, please! The tiller... please!

20:39.613 --> 20:44.325
- Smells good.
- That's mimosa. It was my mo...

20:44.326 --> 20:47.245
Oh, I forgot. I'm not
supposed to talk about that.

20:47.246 --> 20:49.664
- Why?
- Out of the past.

20:49.665 --> 20:53.376
- Oh, go ahead.
- It was my mother's favorite perfume.

20:53.377 --> 20:56.087
My father sent me a
bottle before he died.

20:56.088 --> 20:58.907
I've made it last a long time.

20:59.925 --> 21:02.635
Mimosa. Ever see it growing?

21:02.636 --> 21:05.388
- No, I haven't.
- Like a million little yellow bells.

21:05.389 --> 21:10.040
Like... Like sleigh bells.

21:15.900 --> 21:18.818
It's smooth again.
Are you feeling better?

21:18.819 --> 21:22.530
Oh, yes. I was about
to resume command.

21:22.531 --> 21:25.283
Bring her about sharply.
Head straight for the jetty.

21:25.284 --> 21:28.103
Avast the boom.
Scuttle the funnels.

21:29.914 --> 21:31.891
Lady, please!

21:38.756 --> 21:41.508
I thought you'd gone off
for London, Mr. Fitzgerald.

21:41.509 --> 21:44.954
- Just leaving now, Ben.
- That'd be half a crown.

21:48.057 --> 21:50.099
- You doing up your hair again?
- Yes.

21:50.100 --> 21:52.669
No, no, no! Come on.

21:55.147 --> 21:58.775
It's wonderful like this, all
loose and free and windblown.

21:58.776 --> 22:01.694
What am I doing? Talking high poetry
or selling hairstyle advertising?

22:01.695 --> 22:03.905
- You laugh at everything, don't you?
- Too much?

22:03.906 --> 22:07.977
No. It's just I've never known
anyone who laughed much.

22:09.286 --> 22:11.621
See a lot of Pamela while
I'm away, will you?

22:11.622 --> 22:14.582
- How long will you be gone?
- About three weeks.

22:14.583 --> 22:17.418
Perhaps she'll let me help her
with the curtains and things.

22:17.419 --> 22:20.880
Get her to talk about me.
In a respectful way, of course.

22:20.881 --> 22:24.485
None of those anecdotes where
I'm the family half-wit.

22:26.178 --> 22:28.137
I hope you have a nice trip.

22:28.138 --> 22:30.598
- I'll take you home first.
- You're so late starring.

22:30.599 --> 22:31.891
Might as well.

22:31.892 --> 22:36.312
I'd rather break it gently to Grandfather
about our sail, if you don't mind.

22:36.313 --> 22:39.482
All right. Gently but firmly, mind.

22:39.483 --> 22:41.426
- Good-bye.
- Bye.

22:41.944 --> 22:43.903
- Oh, Mr. Fitzgerald...
- Yes?

22:43.904 --> 22:45.780
I almost forgot to say it.

22:45.781 --> 22:49.117
I'm awfully happy you and your sister
are going to live at Windward.

22:49.118 --> 22:51.846
Why, thank you, Stella Meredith!

23:13.601 --> 23:15.143
Well, here we are.

23:15.144 --> 23:19.230
What a grand house, Master Rick.
'Tis a mansion, so 'tis.

23:19.231 --> 23:23.151
Are you worthy of it, Lizzie Flynn?
That's what I keep asking myself.

23:23.152 --> 23:25.236
'Tis on top of the world.

23:25.237 --> 23:26.487
- Rick!
- Hello, Pam.

23:26.488 --> 23:28.590
- Baby darling!
- Lizzie!

23:30.951 --> 23:32.744
Oh, you devil for being late.

23:32.745 --> 23:35.121
I wanted you to see everything
while it was still daylight.

23:35.122 --> 23:38.249
Ah, Master Rick and his
friends and their cocktails.

23:38.250 --> 23:40.335
- Got Lizzie drunk.
- Get on with you, Master Rick.

23:40.336 --> 23:43.588
- Oh, Bobby!
- Where's our Bobby?

23:43.589 --> 23:46.049
- Don't, Rick.
- Something happen to him?

23:46.050 --> 23:49.010
Nothing tragic. He
just wandered away.

23:49.011 --> 23:50.887
I suppose I haven't
enough dog appeal.

23:50.888 --> 23:54.015
- No, seriously, Pam.
- He loathed the country.

23:54.016 --> 23:58.311
You know, no nice dustbins and no
sporting interest in finding a tree.

23:58.312 --> 24:01.757
Never heard of a
terrier walking out.

24:05.527 --> 24:08.905
Ah, Miss Pamela, I'm
dreaming on me feet.

24:08.906 --> 24:11.741
Pam, it's perfect. You're
practically straight.

24:11.742 --> 24:14.619
There's some soup in the kitchen.

24:14.620 --> 24:17.538
Look at Whiskey now.
He knows where the food is.

24:17.539 --> 24:19.791
- How did the furniture fit in?
- Beautifully.

24:19.792 --> 24:22.251
I saw the grandfather clock.
It waved both hands at me.

24:22.252 --> 24:24.420
If the soup's burned,
Lizzie will spank me.

24:24.421 --> 24:26.798
Get along with you, miss.

24:26.799 --> 24:29.926
The saints be praised!
There's me old rocker.

24:29.927 --> 24:33.657
It's been 10 years since you
nestled your bustle in that.

24:36.100 --> 24:39.454
- You've done wonders, Pam.
- Thanks.

24:41.939 --> 24:45.358
Tell me, what does Stella
think of the changes?

24:45.359 --> 24:46.818
You mean Stella Meredith?

24:46.819 --> 24:48.987
- I haven't set eyes on her.
- You haven't?

24:48.988 --> 24:52.782
I did write and ask her to tea.
Got a reply from the commander...

24:52.783 --> 24:54.993
saying she wasn't strong
enough to accept invitations.

24:54.994 --> 24:56.369
Not strong enough?

24:56.370 --> 24:59.247
I expect it's us. We just
aren't nice to know.

24:59.248 --> 25:02.625
But Stella was crazy to make
friends with you. She told me.

25:02.626 --> 25:04.694
But where did you see her?

25:05.546 --> 25:08.756
Oh, uh, just before
I left for London.

25:08.757 --> 25:11.092
Why, you colossal bluff!

25:11.093 --> 25:13.886
You were just as sorry
for that child as I was.

25:13.887 --> 25:18.516
Stop pushing her into the nursery.
She's 20. She said so herself.

25:18.517 --> 25:20.494
You like her.

25:22.813 --> 25:24.836
I can't help it.

25:26.567 --> 25:30.820
There's kind of a sleeping-beauty
magic about the kid.

25:30.821 --> 25:34.365
I'd thought I'd done something
toward breaking the spell.

25:34.366 --> 25:36.409
Seems not.

25:36.410 --> 25:38.703
Prince Charmless, that's me.

25:38.704 --> 25:40.705
That'll do for
tonight, Mr. Roderick.

25:40.706 --> 25:44.709
It's time for Miss Pamela to
go to bed. She looks tired out.

25:44.710 --> 25:47.170
You're an old tyrant, Lizzie Flynn.

25:47.171 --> 25:49.444
But you're perfectly right.

25:53.052 --> 25:55.154
Put the lights out, Rick.

25:57.014 --> 26:01.711
Now let's see. I think I turn it
down and blow down the chimney.

26:03.312 --> 26:05.897
Haven't done that
since I was a kid.

26:05.898 --> 26:08.342
Come now, Whiskey. Good boy.

26:09.443 --> 26:12.695
- Are you having him in your room?
- He's used to it, the creature.

26:12.696 --> 26:14.890
Get along up, now.

26:15.449 --> 26:18.534
Haven't I carried you
enough this day?

26:18.535 --> 26:21.809
- Get on up, now.
- I'll give him a start.

26:23.457 --> 26:25.917
What in the name of all the saints?

26:25.918 --> 26:29.879
Well, he's not used to
traveling and strange houses.

26:29.880 --> 26:32.256
He'll find me if he wants me.

26:32.257 --> 26:35.718
I've not slept with the sound of
the sea since I left Ireland.

26:35.719 --> 26:37.678
Would you like to go back there?

26:37.679 --> 26:41.875
- I'd sooner see meself dead.
- Ah, go on with yez.

26:44.770 --> 26:47.230
Why, whatever ails these candles?

26:47.231 --> 26:49.816
It seems to be a rather
drafty staircase.

26:49.817 --> 26:52.610
Rick, I've had a swim every
day from our own beach...

26:52.611 --> 26:54.362
and I've started to make a garden.

26:54.363 --> 26:56.864
You learn the oddest
things when you garden.

26:56.865 --> 26:58.991
Did you know there's an
upside-down to seeds?

26:58.992 --> 27:01.869
- No. Good night, Pam.
- Good night, Rick.

27:01.870 --> 27:04.974
- Good night, Master Rick.
- Good night, Liz.

27:11.839 --> 27:13.657
Come in.

27:17.719 --> 27:19.137
I thought you were asleep.

27:19.138 --> 27:22.242
It turns cold in the
night here sometimes.

27:24.226 --> 27:26.078
Oh, thanks.

27:28.355 --> 27:30.982
Rick, there's something I
want to talk to you about.

27:30.983 --> 27:34.527
Do you have any nice cast iron
I can swap for this mattress?

27:34.528 --> 27:38.929
- We'll give you another tomorrow.
- Nothing will keep me awake tonight.

27:39.867 --> 27:42.702
What price our house,
Pam? Pretty good, hmm?

27:42.703 --> 27:46.747
- You're really pleased with it?
- I was never so happy in my life.

27:46.748 --> 27:49.167
Oh, you starred to say
something. What?

27:49.168 --> 27:52.670
It was just that I was the one
that got you to buy the house...

27:52.671 --> 27:55.965
And I didn't appear very
appreciative. Is that it?

27:55.966 --> 27:57.508
It'll wait until tomorrow.

27:57.509 --> 28:00.261
Bless you, Rick. Sleep well.

28:00.262 --> 28:02.160
You too.

28:02.723 --> 28:05.167
These are pretty good apples.

28:07.895 --> 28:11.022
That concludes our
broadcast for today.

28:11.023 --> 28:14.002
Good night, everyone. Good night.

28:52.773 --> 28:54.796
Pam, is that you?

30:11.768 --> 30:13.870
- Rick.
- Pamela.

30:14.646 --> 30:17.565
- We don't want to wake Lizzie.
- But isn't it Lizzie?

30:17.566 --> 30:20.260
No, it isn't Lizzie.

30:20.902 --> 30:22.820
It's coming from downstairs.

30:22.821 --> 30:25.573
It comes from
everywhere and nowhere.

30:25.574 --> 30:29.035
Take hold of yourself, Pam. I'm
going down and search the place.

30:29.036 --> 30:31.746
Rick, I've searched.

30:31.747 --> 30:35.958
- There's never anything there.
- "Never"? You mean you've heard it before?

30:35.959 --> 30:37.835
YES.

30:37.836 --> 30:40.880
Rick, it's true, isn't it? The sound,
I mean. You're hearing it too?

30:40.881 --> 30:43.090
- Of course I'm hearing it.
- I wasn't sure.

30:43.091 --> 30:46.177
- Pam...
- I thought I might be going crazy.

30:46.178 --> 30:49.555
- Was that why you didn't tell me?
- Yes, that, and...

30:49.556 --> 30:53.331
Rick, it's your home. It's
all we've got to live in.

30:56.104 --> 31:00.149
- It sounds so heartbroken.
- Now don't get rattled, Pam.

31:00.150 --> 31:02.401
- There's a logical explanation for this.
- Such as?

31:02.402 --> 31:06.598
You can't expect me to give it to you
offhand, but it stands to reason.

31:08.033 --> 31:10.993
- Does it come every night?
- No.

31:10.994 --> 31:14.955
Just when you begin to think
you dreamt it, it comes again.

31:14.956 --> 31:17.605
Be calm, Pam. Be calm.

31:18.085 --> 31:20.252
I'm all right.

31:20.253 --> 31:22.421
It'll stop soon now.

31:22.422 --> 31:24.256
How do you know?

31:24.257 --> 31:26.405
It dies away at dawn.

31:27.469 --> 31:29.071
Listen.

31:34.434 --> 31:36.411
That's the dawn breeze.

31:38.021 --> 31:41.857
- Well, that's all for tonight.
- It's a pity, really.

31:41.858 --> 31:44.693
Hardly gives one time to look
into it. Now listen, dear.

31:44.694 --> 31:49.490
Look, let's talk tomorrow.
I'll die if I don't get some sleep.

31:49.491 --> 31:51.992
Pam, leave your door open
in case you're nervous.

31:51.993 --> 31:53.869
All right, Rick.

31:53.870 --> 31:55.871
And remember, you haven't
a thing to worry about.

31:55.872 --> 31:58.207
This business can be
scientifically explained.

31:58.208 --> 32:01.210
Probably a loose wire hidden around
the house, acting as an aerial...

32:01.211 --> 32:03.712
picking up the sound of some
woman in the village crying.

32:03.713 --> 32:07.425
Was she crying when the last
tenants were frightened out?

32:07.426 --> 32:10.279
Well, maybe she had a sad life.

32:11.763 --> 32:13.264
Anyway...

32:13.265 --> 32:16.767
I'm here now, and I'm
not the least rattled.

32:16.768 --> 32:19.667
Not the least little
bit in the world.

32:22.399 --> 32:24.843
It's just silly to be upset.

32:39.583 --> 32:42.293
Last night I heard it
myself, Commander Beech.

32:42.294 --> 32:45.754
A perfectly appalling
sound of crying.

32:45.755 --> 32:48.382
Mr. Fitzgerald, Windward
House belongs to you now.

32:48.383 --> 32:51.635
- Why do you bring this matter to me?
- Because we want information.

32:51.636 --> 32:54.847
I for practical reasons, and my sister
because she believes it's a ghost.

32:54.848 --> 32:58.350
- She'd like to know what the ghost wants.
- What utter bosh!

32:58.351 --> 33:02.104
Bosh, I agree, but when
did the noises start?

33:02.105 --> 33:05.024
- You inherited the house, I believe.
- From my grandmother.

33:05.025 --> 33:07.193
And there were no disturbances
there in her time?

33:07.194 --> 33:10.821
None. And if there are noises now,
they're from perfectly natural causes.

33:10.822 --> 33:13.157
An echo from a subterranean
cave, perhaps.

33:13.158 --> 33:15.117
That would've been heard
in your grandmother's day.

33:15.118 --> 33:17.536
Erosion may have changed the
structure of the cliffs.

33:17.537 --> 33:20.915
- It's not' a bad suggestion.
- May I come in, Grandfather?

33:20.916 --> 33:24.126
No, you run along to church.
I'll join you in a few minutes.

33:24.127 --> 33:27.505
- But I want to see Mr. Fitzgerald.
- I'm glad you're better.

33:27.506 --> 33:31.008
"Better"? But I haven't been ill.

33:31.009 --> 33:33.260
Stella merely suffers
with a general delicacy.

33:33.261 --> 33:36.096
- She doesn't accept invitations.
- Never?

33:36.097 --> 33:39.475
Perhaps I'd better frankly state she's
not strong enough to make new friends.

33:39.476 --> 33:41.310
- Grandfather!
- Run along, my dear.

33:41.311 --> 33:44.085
We're discussing
something privately.

33:47.108 --> 33:49.568
Is there anything
else, Mr. Fitzgerald?

33:49.569 --> 33:53.405
Just one more question. Was Stella's
mother ever troubled at Windward House?

33:53.406 --> 33:55.991
- What do you mean?
- Did she hear the crying?

33:55.992 --> 33:58.953
My daughter was not one to
circulate ridiculous rumors.

33:58.954 --> 34:01.747
If she'd heard this, she'd have
mentioned it, and she never did?

34:01.748 --> 34:03.123
Certainly not.

34:03.124 --> 34:04.959
Then the trouble must have
begun since her death.

34:04.960 --> 34:08.254
- Do you mean to imply...
- No, I'm merely trying to set the date.

34:08.255 --> 34:11.966
- I didn't mean that your daughter haunts
- How dare you suggest such a thing?

34:11.967 --> 34:15.553
Really, I'm most desperately
sorry. Please forgive me.

34:15.554 --> 34:19.348
Very well. I accept your apology.
But please understand one thing.

34:19.349 --> 34:24.170
Your purchase of the property doesn't
establish a social bond between us.

34:24.688 --> 34:27.982
What's the matter with us? Why
don't you allow Stella to see us?

34:27.983 --> 34:29.733
Because I don't want to.

34:29.734 --> 34:32.652
And I must ask for your word not
to send her any more invitations.

34:32.654 --> 34:34.446
I'll give you no such undertaking.

34:34.447 --> 34:37.032
Very well. I shall know how
to deal with the matter.

34:37.033 --> 34:40.119
Stella is not going
inside that house!

34:40.120 --> 34:44.440
Great Scott! You believe
the place is haunted.

34:54.634 --> 34:58.659
I hoped you'd come along.
I wanted to talk to you.

34:59.264 --> 35:02.584
- Quick, drive around the next corner.
- Get in.

35:06.563 --> 35:09.189
You had four freckles on
the boat. They've gone.

35:09.190 --> 35:12.760
I couldn't go to see your sister.
Grandfather's been ill.

35:13.820 --> 35:15.513
Turn here.

35:21.494 --> 35:23.996
Now, what is this about
your not seeing Pamela?

35:23.997 --> 35:27.708
At the mention of me coming to Windward,
Grandfather almost had an attack.

35:27.709 --> 35:29.501
You feel your mother
never would've left him?

35:29.502 --> 35:30.836
No, never.

35:30.837 --> 35:33.839
Yet she did when she married, and
he seemed to survive very nicely.

35:33.840 --> 35:35.174
He was younger then.

35:35.175 --> 35:38.135
Oh, so you're going to turn into
one of these dim little ladies...

35:38.136 --> 35:40.596
who fill hot-water bottles
for elderly relatives.

35:40.597 --> 35:44.016
- Good-bye, Stella Meredith.
- I'm not now.

35:44.017 --> 35:45.809
You're here now.

35:45.810 --> 35:49.355
That's practically the nicest
sentence that ever was spoken.

35:49.356 --> 35:51.815
Would you and your sister be in
if I came to Windward tonight?

35:51.816 --> 35:53.275
Yes.

35:53.276 --> 35:56.846
Supper's at 8:00, but please
come as early as you can.

35:58.490 --> 36:01.639
Bob down. He's passing
the end of the lane.

36:03.620 --> 36:05.393
He's gone.

36:05.872 --> 36:07.790
How will I ever get to church?

36:07.791 --> 36:11.270
Sit on the floor, and
I'll drive you past him.

36:14.964 --> 36:18.238
- Drive to the side gate, please.
- Yes.

36:31.231 --> 36:34.460
- Like a lift, Commander?
- No, thank you.

36:39.072 --> 36:41.115
Oh! What a moment!

36:41.116 --> 36:45.346
- Were you scared?
- Yes, but it was wonderful.

36:57.632 --> 37:00.702
Well, good-bye. Say a
little prayer for me.

37:01.469 --> 37:05.824
Golly! How am I ever going to
feel meek enough for church?

37:06.683 --> 37:08.501
Oh, Stella.

37:08.977 --> 37:10.894
Here's your prayer book and purse.

37:10.895 --> 37:13.373
- Good-bye.
- Good-bye.

37:36.629 --> 37:39.214
Thank you, Mrs. Carlton, Colonel.

37:39.215 --> 37:40.924
- Until next Sunday.
- Yes.

37:40.925 --> 37:43.153
- Good-bye.
- Good-bye.

37:44.345 --> 37:47.039
You seem very silent, Stella.

37:47.474 --> 37:50.350
What have you against the
Fitzgeralds, Grandfather?

37:50.351 --> 37:52.920
Well, they're hardly our sort.

37:53.980 --> 37:56.440
I've decided to make
friends with them.

37:56.441 --> 37:58.543
You'll do no such thing.

38:01.154 --> 38:02.863
Why do you say that, Grandfather?

38:02.864 --> 38:06.033
I do not consider it suitable for
you to visit Windward House.

38:06.034 --> 38:09.286
- Not suitable?
- I can't discuss the matter.

38:09.287 --> 38:12.956
- That's all the reason I'm going to get?
- It will have to suffice, yes.

38:12.957 --> 38:16.794
No, Grandfather. I'm 20, and I'm...

38:16.795 --> 38:19.505
and it's time I stopped
living somebody else's life.

38:19.506 --> 38:23.425
- I shall go to Windward whenever I please.
- Did you hear what I said?

38:23.426 --> 38:26.678
It isn't any good,
Grandfather. I'm on strike.

38:26.679 --> 38:29.139
Stella, go to your room.

38:29.140 --> 38:32.017
No use trying to lock me in.
There isn't any key.

38:32.018 --> 38:34.462
Now don't be impertinent.

38:37.232 --> 38:39.900
- Hello, Annie.
- Dinner will be late, miss.

38:39.901 --> 38:42.236
I'm having ever such
trouble with the lamb.

38:42.237 --> 38:44.715
You'd better tell the commander.

38:49.244 --> 38:53.038
Yes, it's very urgent. Will
you try to hurry the call?

38:53.039 --> 38:56.166
Thank you. I'm telephoning.
Close that door.

38:56.167 --> 39:00.295
It's just that dinner will be late,
sir. It's the lamb being awkward.

39:00.296 --> 39:04.800
I won't be here for dinner.
And take some to Stella on a tray.

39:04.801 --> 39:07.074
And close that door!

39:11.891 --> 39:13.868
May I speak to Miss Holloway?

39:18.356 --> 39:22.150
It's a trunk call, Miss Holloway.
A Commander Beech.

39:22.151 --> 39:24.003
Thank you.

39:27.240 --> 39:28.407
Yes, Commander Beech?

39:28.408 --> 39:31.952
I want to consult you about
Stella, Miss Holloway.

39:31.953 --> 39:36.206
It's a matter of the utmost urgency.
I can be with you late this afternoon.

39:36.207 --> 39:40.878
I can't see you till this evening, but I
shall be glad to put you up for the night.

39:40.879 --> 39:43.171
Isn't it a little late to
consult me about Stella?

39:43.172 --> 39:46.758
Yes, I know that, but I
beg you to help me now.

39:46.759 --> 39:50.220
You're the only human being in
the world to whom I can turn.

39:50.221 --> 39:53.056
The only person who wouldn't
think me demented...

39:53.057 --> 39:56.643
because I believe a house can
be filled with malignity.

39:56.644 --> 39:59.964
Malignity directed
against a certain child.

40:01.733 --> 40:03.692
The dining room isn't finished yet.

40:03.693 --> 40:06.695
How glad this house must
be to be lived in again.

40:06.696 --> 40:08.947
I must dash back to Lizzie.
We're fighting...

40:08.948 --> 40:11.366
over how much sherry you
put in a tipsy pudding.

40:11.367 --> 40:13.577
She wants to make it dead drunk.

40:13.578 --> 40:16.580
- Do you like tipsy pudding?
- I think I like everything to eat.

40:16.581 --> 40:19.541
Show her the rest of the
house before it's dark.

40:19.542 --> 40:21.460
You've really never been
here since you were three?

40:21.461 --> 40:22.711
Not inside.

40:22.712 --> 40:26.256
But I walked here once when I was
ten and peered in at the windows.

40:26.257 --> 40:28.258
There was a stupendous row...

40:28.259 --> 40:31.178
and the next week I got packed
off to a school in Brussels.

40:31.179 --> 40:34.014
- Did your grandfather give you reasons?
- "Reasons"?

40:34.015 --> 40:38.370
If I'd ever been reasoned with,
I might have been a better child.

40:39.062 --> 40:44.168
- My old nursery's through there, isn't it?
- I should think so. It had nursery wallpaper.

40:45.735 --> 40:49.009
How pretty your sister's made it!

40:54.577 --> 40:56.578
What is it?

40:56.579 --> 40:59.039
Something I'd forgotten.

40:59.040 --> 41:01.083
When I was little...

41:01.084 --> 41:03.377
I used to have a dream
about this room.

41:03.378 --> 41:05.170
You did?

41:05.171 --> 41:08.090
I'd be lying here,
and it'd be dark...

41:08.091 --> 41:11.301
and cold and frightening.

41:11.302 --> 41:15.472
And then... a little
flame would come.

41:15.473 --> 41:18.809
Just a tiny point
of light so big...

41:18.810 --> 41:21.979
and yet suddenly
everything would be...

41:21.980 --> 41:25.459
warm and light and peaceful.

41:26.192 --> 41:27.818
And then...

41:27.819 --> 41:31.029
someone would come and put the
flame out, and I'd be terrified.

41:31.030 --> 41:33.281
Perhaps your mother used
to bring you a night light.

41:33.282 --> 41:35.601
But who'd take it out?

41:38.079 --> 41:41.228
May I see the studio
before it's dark?

41:44.919 --> 41:49.024
It's rather messy in here.
I was thinking of skipping this.

41:49.465 --> 41:52.785
This is where my father
painted my mother's picture.

41:54.012 --> 41:56.535
Strange to think of them here.

41:58.850 --> 42:02.936
My father would have his easel
to the light, wouldn't he?

42:02.937 --> 42:07.232
And perhaps my mother would sit
there in her soft, white dress.

42:07.233 --> 42:09.651
But sometimes, of course,
he'd paint the other one.

42:09.652 --> 42:11.945
- "The other one"?
- He had a model, you know.

42:11.946 --> 42:13.822
A foreign girl.

42:13.823 --> 42:16.992
I've never been able to
find out much about her.

42:16.993 --> 42:20.203
People get awfully
hush-hush when I ask them.

42:20.204 --> 42:22.372
Between you and me and
the grand piano...

42:22.373 --> 42:25.333
I suspect Father was
a bit of a bad hat.

42:25.334 --> 42:29.588
- Artistic temperament?
- Very artistic, I'm afraid.

42:29.589 --> 42:32.382
But sometimes, you know,
it's quite a comfort to me.

42:32.383 --> 42:35.844
- In what way?
- If Father had been as good as Mother...

42:35.845 --> 42:39.056
think how good I'd have been.

42:39.057 --> 42:42.707
It's getting almost too
dark to see you properly.

42:51.861 --> 42:54.446
Won't you play something?

42:54.447 --> 42:57.141
It's about time you asked me that.

43:41.994 --> 43:45.872
- Oh, please go on.
- Just a second.

43:45.873 --> 43:48.500
- You made that up?
- Yes.

43:48.501 --> 43:50.877
- But you must be brilliant!
- Oh, dazzling.

43:50.878 --> 43:54.172
- People have to wear sunglasses.
- What's it called?

43:54.173 --> 43:58.218
It's a serenade.
"To Stella by Starlight."

43:58.219 --> 44:00.947
You mean, this Stella?

44:01.514 --> 44:04.724
But it's the most exciting thing
that's ever happened to me!

44:04.725 --> 44:06.498
Is it?

44:06.936 --> 44:08.959
Please go on.

44:16.070 --> 44:19.094
You see, this is the only
way I can paint you.

44:19.615 --> 44:22.325
Some black keys and some white...

44:22.326 --> 44:25.328
and fingers that are
much too clumsy...

44:25.329 --> 44:27.682
but you're in it somehow.

44:44.015 --> 44:47.851
It's gone awfully sad.
Why have you changed it?

44:47.852 --> 44:50.205
It just came out that way.

45:02.617 --> 45:06.203
What's the matter? What is it,
Stella? You're trembling.

45:06.204 --> 45:10.290
I was wicked. How could I ever
have laughed in her house?

45:10.291 --> 45:13.126
But it's my house
now, Pam's and mine.

45:13.127 --> 45:16.948
But she was so young, and
she died so cruelly.

45:19.217 --> 45:20.990
Stella!

45:23.012 --> 45:24.830
Stella!

45:26.432 --> 45:29.285
- Rick, what is it?
- I don't know. It's that blasted room!

45:31.312 --> 45:33.255
Stella, stop!

45:37.985 --> 45:39.177
Stella!

45:41.155 --> 45:43.406
For heaven's sake, Stella!

45:43.407 --> 45:45.867
- What's the matter, Rick?
- You were going over the edge.

45:45.868 --> 45:48.536
- Was I?
- If I hadn't caught you.

45:48.537 --> 45:51.206
I hadn't any sense
of danger at all.

45:51.207 --> 45:52.791
Look.

45:52.792 --> 45:57.147
I think this is where my mother
fell. By the dead tree.

45:58.881 --> 46:00.674
Are you all right?

46:00.675 --> 46:03.635
Quite, thanks, except
dying of hunger.

46:03.636 --> 46:07.013
Then you must come
and get some food.

46:07.014 --> 46:09.724
Do you know this is our very
first party in this house?

46:09.725 --> 46:11.643
- Is it?
- Shall we sing her the song?

46:11.644 --> 46:13.838
His introduction to music.

46:26.909 --> 46:28.761
Stay here.

46:32.748 --> 46:35.000
Lizzie, where are you?
What's the matter?

46:35.001 --> 46:38.230
Mr. Roderick! Mr. Roderick!

46:43.426 --> 46:47.846
- What is it, Lizzie? Are you hurt?
- The studio door...

46:47.847 --> 46:50.473
there's something there.

46:50.474 --> 46:52.934
Look, Lizzie, there's
nothing there.

46:52.935 --> 46:56.563
There was! I saw it
with me own two eyes!

46:56.564 --> 46:58.231
What?

46:58.232 --> 47:01.818
It was like a mist...
a crawling mist.

47:01.819 --> 47:04.237
You imagined it just because you
heard the house was haunted.

47:04.238 --> 47:07.115
I'd heard nothing of the
sort, Mr. Roderick.

47:07.116 --> 47:10.410
Holy saints! Are you
tellin' me it is?

47:10.411 --> 47:12.454
For heaven's sake,
Rick, what is it?

47:12.455 --> 47:14.873
Oh, Lizzie's dreamed up
a ghost for herself.

47:14.874 --> 47:17.042
Come along, Lizzie.

47:17.043 --> 47:19.002
Oh, darling Lizzie.

47:19.003 --> 47:21.546
I'd just come upstairs
to turn down the beds.

47:21.547 --> 47:24.549
There it stood by the studio
door, looking down at me.

47:24.550 --> 47:28.470
- A woman, it was.
- Four steps back, it was just a mist.

47:28.471 --> 47:30.430
'Twas a woman. I swear it.

47:30.431 --> 47:32.932
The ghost of a woman!

47:32.933 --> 47:36.378
Come and sit down. You'll
be all right in a minute.

47:42.818 --> 47:46.446
- Have some sherry, Lizzie.
- Just a drop.

47:46.447 --> 47:48.907
I'll not sleep in this house
another night, Mr. Roderick.

47:48.908 --> 47:51.951
- Come now, Lizzie.
- I will not! I'd sooner die.

47:51.952 --> 47:54.829
She can go to the Jessup farm.

47:54.830 --> 47:57.024
What's happened to Stella?

47:58.793 --> 48:01.753
She was with me when I came in.

48:01.754 --> 48:03.606
Stella?

48:07.927 --> 48:10.029
Stella, where are you?

48:12.264 --> 48:14.583
Stella, are you in the house?

48:19.271 --> 48:21.044
Stella!

48:24.235 --> 48:26.713
Pamela! Pamela!

48:30.991 --> 48:32.934
Stella, darling.

48:34.412 --> 48:36.810
Yes, Rick? What's happened?

48:38.290 --> 48:40.333
- Rick, what is it?
- She's in a dead faint.

48:40.334 --> 48:43.438
- This room, it's like an icebox.
- Colder.

48:44.839 --> 48:46.047
We'll have to get a doctor.

48:46.048 --> 48:48.947
There's one at the first
house in the village.

48:50.428 --> 48:52.178
That's a girl.

48:52.179 --> 48:55.265
Well, what kind of
bogey did you see?

48:55.266 --> 48:57.058
I didn't see anything.

48:57.059 --> 49:00.061
Fainted out of sheer
cussedness, huh?

49:00.062 --> 49:03.382
I can only remember
the cold coming.

49:03.899 --> 49:05.967
Hello, Stella.

49:07.570 --> 49:11.015
- Hello.
- You suddenly felt cold?

49:12.450 --> 49:14.617
It wasn't just that.

49:14.618 --> 49:19.414
- The room went cold, and I was frightened.
- Well, you just forget about it for a bit.

49:19.415 --> 49:24.362
Miss Fitzgerald's got some soup for you.
See if you can get her to take some.

49:35.389 --> 49:38.099
She'll do all right, but it's
quite a nasty case of shock.

49:38.100 --> 49:40.852
- That's all? You're quite sure?
- Sit down.

49:40.853 --> 49:43.456
You see, I brought her here.

49:44.315 --> 49:46.149
Take that neat.

49:46.150 --> 49:48.651
Can, uh... Can she
stay the night here?

49:48.652 --> 49:51.613
Oh, yes. But suppose that
spook starts howling?

49:51.614 --> 49:52.739
Oh, your spook.

49:52.740 --> 49:56.075
It's just an echo from a cave
probably, but it sounds like a spook.

49:56.076 --> 49:58.786
I'd rather risk it
than move her tonight.

49:58.787 --> 50:01.581
There was some rather queer
business earlier this evening.

50:01.582 --> 50:04.626
The cliff is so close, and she walked right
to the edge. If I hadn't caught her...

50:04.627 --> 50:07.230
We'll keep a close watch.

50:07.713 --> 50:11.174
- Did she take her soup?
- Eight spoonfuls, then drifted off to sleep.

50:11.175 --> 50:13.468
Splendid. She'll
sleep for hours now.

50:13.469 --> 50:17.013
- We'll keep on watch here.
- You'd better go to bed, Miss Fitzgerald.

50:17.014 --> 50:20.266
- You're looking all in.
- I'd rather watch with you.

50:20.267 --> 50:22.602
- Would you like some coffee?
- Thanks.

50:22.603 --> 50:26.272
Pam, who do you think's
moved in with Dr. Scott?

50:26.273 --> 50:28.066
- Our Bobby.
- No!

50:28.067 --> 50:32.070
I found the poor dog in the street.
He was in a pitiable state of nerves.

50:32.071 --> 50:33.738
- How is he now?
- Fine.

50:33.739 --> 50:37.283
- Bobby was the first to see the ghost.
- See? Pamela believes it.

50:37.284 --> 50:41.788
Rick, stop hiding your head in the sand.
You heard the sounds last night.

50:41.789 --> 50:43.915
Lizzie's been half frightened
out of her wits...

50:43.916 --> 50:46.334
and Stella's been in
deadly danger twice.

50:46.335 --> 50:48.836
Everyone in the village
knows the house is strange.

50:48.837 --> 50:50.672
I expected support from you.

50:50.673 --> 50:54.467
You must tell us everything you know about
the place after I've made the coffee.

50:54.468 --> 50:56.636
Unfortunately I'm a
newcomer to Biddlecombe.

50:56.637 --> 50:59.786
I've only lived here 12 years.

51:02.142 --> 51:05.186
It's not ancient history
to us. Please go on.

51:05.187 --> 51:06.771
The model's name was Carmel.

51:06.772 --> 51:09.607
She was a Spanish gypsy,
and a thorough bad lot.

51:09.608 --> 51:11.526
So was Meredith, from
what I can gather.

51:11.527 --> 51:15.280
- Didn't Mrs. Meredith suspect? - She
must have. The thing was an open scandal.

51:15.281 --> 51:18.533
The girl and he'd have been stoned out
of the village if not for Mary Meredith.

51:18.534 --> 51:22.912
She was very much admired. I suppose
she just accepted the situation.

51:22.913 --> 51:25.290
And she's still sobbing
her hear: out about it.

51:25.291 --> 51:28.418
- Where's Carmel now?
- Dead. She died in this very house...

51:28.419 --> 51:32.547
a week after Mary fell from the cliff trying
to save her from suicide. Ironic, wasn't it?

51:32.548 --> 51:36.467
- Is it known why the girl tried to kill herself?
- Meredith's said to have tired of her.

51:36.468 --> 51:40.847
Think of it... those two women
struggling on the cliff.

51:40.848 --> 51:42.974
I wonder if Mary's death
could have been murder.

51:42.975 --> 51:44.726
It's been hinted at.

51:44.727 --> 51:48.479
The whole story was dug up and
embroidered when Stella's father died.

51:48.480 --> 51:50.523
- When was that?
- Three years ago, abroad.

51:50.524 --> 51:54.444
- He never came back to Windward.
- All of them dead with their secrets.

51:54.445 --> 51:57.280
One of them's not quite
dead enough for me.

51:57.281 --> 51:59.991
Don't say that about the poor soul.

51:59.992 --> 52:03.620
If a spirit comes back, it's
for some particular purpose.

52:03.621 --> 52:07.332
- That's my sister's special crotchet.
- We've got to find out what it is.

52:07.333 --> 52:11.252
I wish I knew some more,
but I'm afraid I don't.

52:11.253 --> 52:14.756
- What time's your wailing lady due?
- About dawn.

52:14.757 --> 52:18.612
We ought to know each other
pretty well by then.

52:20.095 --> 52:23.389
Twenty-one hand. I'm out.

52:23.390 --> 52:26.851
- Is it my deal?
- It was, two hours ago.

52:26.852 --> 52:29.479
5:30.

52:29.480 --> 52:33.084
Yes, Moaning Martha seems
to have missed her cue.

52:34.485 --> 52:37.320
Rick, have you brought
some more flowers in?

52:37.321 --> 52:39.030
No. Why?

52:39.031 --> 52:42.116
Don't you notice the scent?
It's overpowering.

52:42.117 --> 52:44.311
Extraordinary.

52:44.745 --> 52:47.121
Heliotrope, isn't it?

52:47.122 --> 52:49.040
No.

52:49.041 --> 52:51.109
No, it's mimosa.

52:52.878 --> 52:56.506
- There's a light!
- Where did that come from?

52:56.507 --> 52:58.951
It's like a night-light.

53:06.934 --> 53:08.911
She's gone!

53:09.853 --> 53:11.546
Rick, the window!

53:12.731 --> 53:15.926
- What is it?
- Where are you, Stella?

53:26.203 --> 53:28.351
Don't be afraid, Stella.

53:29.540 --> 53:33.251
- "Afraid"?
- Well, we were, a little.

53:33.252 --> 53:35.920
I wanted to see the dawn with her.

53:35.921 --> 53:37.694
"Her"?

53:38.424 --> 53:40.883
Don't you know who
it is in your house?

53:40.884 --> 53:43.828
- It's my mother.
- You saw her?

53:44.263 --> 53:46.764
I didn't see her...

53:46.765 --> 53:49.767
but when I woke, she
was here in the room.

53:49.768 --> 53:54.749
It was full of her scent. I could
feel her presence everywhere.

53:55.983 --> 53:58.693
And there was something else...

53:58.694 --> 54:01.738
something I've never
known in my whole life.

54:01.739 --> 54:03.281
What?

54:03.282 --> 54:07.201
The knowledge that... someone
loved me very dearly.

54:07.202 --> 54:10.621
Come on, young Stella.
I'll take you home.

54:10.622 --> 54:12.331
But I don't want to go.

54:12.332 --> 54:14.834
Sorry, but I've got to get
some sleep, you know.

54:14.835 --> 54:18.004
- But I can come back?
- No.

54:18.005 --> 54:21.299
What do you mean? You couldn't
want to keep me away from her.

54:21.300 --> 54:24.260
Stella, remember how ill
you were last night?

54:24.261 --> 54:26.429
But that was nothing
to do with her.

54:26.430 --> 54:29.223
I think I was just frightened
after what Lizzie said.

54:29.224 --> 54:31.684
I tell you, my mother
would never hurt me.

54:31.685 --> 54:34.664
I shan't be afraid again. Please.

54:36.982 --> 54:41.027
I'm sorry. It's just that
my knees are wobbly.

54:41.028 --> 54:43.847
Come along. Dr. Scott
will drive you home.

54:58.754 --> 55:01.798
I wonder what I've done to
her, bringing her here.

55:01.799 --> 55:03.800
Don't blame yourself.

55:03.801 --> 55:07.701
But that look in her eyes,
that terrible happiness.

55:11.016 --> 55:14.018
Wait a minute. Perhaps she's
nearer right than we are.

55:14.019 --> 55:17.355
- She's what?
- Perhaps she's right in being happy.

55:17.356 --> 55:21.359
Supposing Mary Meredith's spirit
had been searching for Stella...

55:21.360 --> 55:24.964
and now that it's found
her, it's found peace.

55:25.656 --> 55:28.741
Suppose we haven't a ghost anymore.

55:28.742 --> 55:31.160
- Where are you going?
- To the studio.

55:31.161 --> 55:33.538
How has it always shown
itself in the past?

55:33.539 --> 55:37.625
Sobbing sounds downstairs, and
cold and depression in the studio.

55:37.626 --> 55:41.212
There wasn't any sobbing tonight,
only warmth and fragrance.

55:41.213 --> 55:43.840
- But why the studio?
- I'll know in there.

55:43.841 --> 55:47.366
I'll know whether it's a decent,
human room. Won't you?

55:52.516 --> 55:54.892
It may not be quite
so cold, really.

55:54.893 --> 55:58.104
Oh, stop it, Pam.
It's clammy and rotten.

55:58.105 --> 56:00.982
Whatever it is, it's
in here with us.

56:00.983 --> 56:02.960
Let's get out.

56:18.458 --> 56:21.232
Mary Meredith, please.

56:22.004 --> 56:25.840
Please. We're sorry
you had to suffer.

56:25.841 --> 56:29.787
Isn't that enough?
What more do you want?

56:30.470 --> 56:32.972
You were right about
one thing, Pam:

56:32.973 --> 56:36.043
We haven't a ghost anymore.
We've got two of them.

56:39.771 --> 56:43.190
- Is Commander Beech at home?
- He won't be back until this evening, sir.

56:43.191 --> 56:46.861
- It's Miss Stella I really want to see.
- Won't you come in? I'll tell her.

56:46.862 --> 56:48.714
Thank you.

56:52.951 --> 56:55.804
Miss Stella's in her
room, sir. I'll...

56:58.206 --> 57:00.666
- Rick.
- Stella.

57:00.667 --> 57:03.210
- I knew you couldn't mean it.
- Mean what?

57:03.211 --> 57:05.588
Haven't you come to
take me to Windward?

57:05.589 --> 57:07.256
No, Stella.

57:07.257 --> 57:09.951
You mustn't go there again, ever.

57:10.636 --> 57:12.595
Listen, darling...

57:12.596 --> 57:15.932
I've thought this thing out, and
you must go away from here.

57:15.933 --> 57:18.351
- Go away?
- Yes, forever.

57:18.352 --> 57:19.685
You wouldn't care?

57:19.686 --> 57:22.396
Not in the least, because
I'll be coming with you.

57:22.397 --> 57:26.108
It won't be luxury, just the smallest
London flat, but it'll be ours.

57:26.109 --> 57:28.152
And no unseen, uninvited guests.

57:28.153 --> 57:30.571
- And Windward?
- We'll tear it down and forget it.

57:30.572 --> 57:32.156
And my mother?

57:32.157 --> 57:34.867
But Stella, you're talking
of a dream and a memory.

57:34.868 --> 57:38.454
I'm talking about my mother.
She's been waiting for me.

57:38.455 --> 57:41.958
In some queer sort of
way, I always knew it.

57:41.959 --> 57:45.461
What about me? I was under the
impression you cared for me.

57:45.462 --> 57:47.755
This hasn't anything
to do with you.

57:47.756 --> 57:51.342
You talk about destroying that house.
You'd be tearing me apart.

57:51.343 --> 57:55.137
Stop it, Stella. Do you
care for me or don't you?

57:55.138 --> 57:58.557
I can't think about you,
not while she's out there.

57:58.558 --> 57:59.767
Take me there.

57:59.768 --> 58:03.604
But this is horrible, unhealthy
stuff. Put it out of your mind.

58:03.605 --> 58:06.065
Turn your back on the
past and run, run hard.

58:06.066 --> 58:08.317
I'll go there somehow.

58:08.318 --> 58:11.888
- You won't, I promise you.
- I hate you for that.

58:13.115 --> 58:14.808
Stella.

58:17.285 --> 58:20.685
You shan't make me
forget her! You shan't!

58:26.086 --> 58:28.004
That's enough, Bobby.
That's enough.

58:28.005 --> 58:30.131
You'll get lipstick poisoning.

58:30.132 --> 58:32.466
He's got a passion for
hard-boiled eggs. Did you know?

58:32.467 --> 58:33.968
And turnip tops.

58:33.969 --> 58:36.929
I don't think he has any
idea he's a dog. Not really.

58:36.930 --> 58:40.474
Of course, he thinks he has a
rather odd figure for a man.

58:40.475 --> 58:43.019
I didn't question him very
closely about where he belonged.

58:43.020 --> 58:45.938
I was afraid I might find out.
I'm sorry now.

58:45.939 --> 58:49.692
- Sorry?
- Yes. I should've met you sooner.

58:49.693 --> 58:52.546
- Are you there, Scott?
- In here.

58:54.281 --> 58:56.657
- Did you see Stella?
- Yes, I did.

58:56.658 --> 58:59.452
You've got to do something.
She's on the edge of a collapse.

58:59.453 --> 59:03.247
You're telling me? This is hardly a
case for a country doctor, you know.

59:03.248 --> 59:05.791
- When does the commander get back?
- Last train tonight.

59:05.792 --> 59:08.169
- Heaven help young Stella then.
- Look here.

59:08.170 --> 59:11.338
Can't you convince her her mother
wouldn't want her to go near that house?

59:11.339 --> 59:15.384
Not I. She's been listening for a
voice that's been still for 17 years.

59:15.385 --> 59:17.303
I can give her a sedative.

59:17.304 --> 59:20.264
Why don't we try to get a
message from Mary Meredith?

59:20.265 --> 59:22.558
- Do what?
- We could hold a séance.

59:22.559 --> 59:23.517
You're not serious?

59:23.518 --> 59:26.562
That's how the dead are supposed
to communicate with the living.

59:26.563 --> 59:30.024
- According to the idiot fringe.
- You have no right to say that.

59:30.025 --> 59:32.860
Many intelligent people
believe in spiritualism.

59:32.861 --> 59:35.488
- Have you ever been to a séance?
- I have.

59:35.489 --> 59:38.866
Shaded lights, the alphabet laid out on
the table, an upside-down wine glass...

59:38.867 --> 59:42.620
messages from somebody's Uncle Oswald,
how to find a mislaid toothbrush. Oh!

59:42.621 --> 59:46.066
Stop scoffing, Rick.
Not all séances are faked.

59:47.751 --> 59:50.127
All right, we'll have a séance.

59:50.128 --> 59:53.214
It shouldn't be difficult to move a glass
around and say it's Mary Meredith.

59:53.215 --> 59:55.174
- What do you think?
- Leave me out of this.

59:55.175 --> 59:56.759
I won't let you cheat Stella.

59:56.760 --> 59:59.136
What do you expect Mary
Meredith to tell her?

59:59.137 --> 01:00:01.972
"Entrust your life to a tall, dark
man, excruciatingly handsome"?

01:00:01.973 --> 01:00:05.851
Crikey, no! I want to set Stella's mind
at rest. She's just about torn in two.

01:00:05.852 --> 01:00:09.438
Unless the conflict
inside her is stopped...

01:00:09.439 --> 01:00:13.609
- it may even affect her reason.
- Here's a message that might do it:

01:00:13.610 --> 01:00:17.363
"Stella, this is your mother. Since
I've found you, I've found peace.

01:00:17.364 --> 01:00:19.490
Stay away from Windward House."

01:00:19.491 --> 01:00:21.951
- Stella would have to be at the séance.
- Naturally.

01:00:21.952 --> 01:00:24.662
It'll have to be at Windward,
and it's dangerous for her.

01:00:24.663 --> 01:00:29.439
- We'd be with her all the time.
- All right. It may be worth a try.

01:00:39.010 --> 01:00:41.887
The important thing is that
we should all believe.

01:00:41.888 --> 01:00:45.808
- Isn't it, Dr. Scott?
- So I understand. What now?

01:00:45.809 --> 01:00:48.833
Everybody puts a
finger on the glass.

01:00:51.773 --> 01:00:54.877
Perhaps you should ask
some questions, Stella.

01:00:56.862 --> 01:00:58.964
Is anybody here?

01:01:12.210 --> 01:01:14.153
Are you my mother?

01:01:19.676 --> 01:01:23.826
You don't want me to stay away
from Windward, do you, Mother?

01:01:32.439 --> 01:01:36.192
Oh, I knew it, Mother.
And I want to be near you too.

01:01:36.193 --> 01:01:40.218
Is that why you stay here,
just to be near me?

01:01:43.533 --> 01:01:47.703
But you're holding it, Rick.
And you, Dr. Scott. Holding it hard.

01:01:47.704 --> 01:01:49.898
Take your fingers off.

01:01:52.375 --> 01:01:56.400
Is that your reason, darling?
Just to be near me?

01:02:03.929 --> 01:02:05.827
But what else?

01:02:09.601 --> 01:02:11.248
I...

01:02:11.937 --> 01:02:13.664
G...

01:02:15.148 --> 01:02:17.524
U... A...

01:02:17.525 --> 01:02:19.318
"I guard."

01:02:19.319 --> 01:02:22.468
You mean, you guard
me from some danger?

01:02:25.784 --> 01:02:27.431
But what?

01:02:29.204 --> 01:02:30.726
C...

01:02:32.249 --> 01:02:33.851
A...

01:02:34.876 --> 01:02:36.523
R...

01:02:37.754 --> 01:02:40.277
- M...
- "Carmel."

01:02:51.059 --> 01:02:52.851
- That's enough.
- It is indeed.

01:02:52.852 --> 01:02:55.250
Let's go into the other room.

01:02:57.440 --> 01:02:59.858
- Stella, what is it?
- Are you ill, Stella?

01:02:59.859 --> 01:03:02.236
Quiet. Leave her alone.

01:03:02.237 --> 01:03:04.363
Oigan. ¡Oigan!

01:03:04.364 --> 01:03:06.907
- Stop her, Scott!
- She's in a trance.

01:03:06.908 --> 01:03:10.202
I saw this happen once before at a
séance. I thought it was a fake.

01:03:10.203 --> 01:03:13.247
- But this isn't.
- I know. It's dangerous.

01:03:13.248 --> 01:03:15.416
- May I ask her some questions?
- No!

01:03:15.417 --> 01:03:17.793
It may be best to try
and reach her mind.

01:03:17.794 --> 01:03:20.943
Now keep your voice
quiet and reassuring.

01:03:22.590 --> 01:03:24.967
Are you Mary Meredith,
Stella's mother?

01:03:24.968 --> 01:03:28.012
Ella no e'. Ella no e'!

01:03:28.013 --> 01:03:29.555
¡No le crean na'!

01:03:29.556 --> 01:03:32.016
¡No le pongan oido
que está mintiendo!

01:03:32.017 --> 01:03:34.290
Don't ask her any more!

01:03:36.104 --> 01:03:37.896
That's the doorbell.

01:03:37.897 --> 01:03:40.566
Shall I answer it?
Lizzie's at the Jessups'.

01:03:40.567 --> 01:03:43.319
No. Don't move until she's
over the worst of this.

01:03:43.320 --> 01:03:46.572
¡So' ladrona!
!Ladrona de mi cariño!

01:03:46.573 --> 01:03:49.366
- Spanish, isn't it, Scott?
- I don't know.

01:03:49.367 --> 01:03:52.453
Rick, the mimosa scent!

01:03:52.454 --> 01:03:55.205
The room's full of it!

01:03:55.206 --> 01:03:57.729
Mary Meredith's in here too.

01:04:00.712 --> 01:04:02.530
The cold.

01:04:02.881 --> 01:04:05.257
It's never been cold in here.

01:04:05.258 --> 01:04:08.032
The candles! Look at the candles!

01:04:14.476 --> 01:04:17.500
- I'd better answer it.
- All right.

01:04:17.937 --> 01:04:20.105
Stop, Pamela!

01:04:20.106 --> 01:04:22.208
Don't go near that door.

01:04:34.120 --> 01:04:36.188
It's coming toward us!

01:04:46.007 --> 01:04:48.467
What in thunder is this?

01:04:48.468 --> 01:04:52.054
- Stella dear, it's all right now.
- We must get her out.

01:04:52.055 --> 01:04:55.079
What have you been
doing to the child?

01:04:56.476 --> 01:04:59.603
- What's the meaning of this, Dr. Scott?
- I can't explain now.

01:04:59.604 --> 01:05:03.232
- This is incredible behavior!
- Quietly, Stella.

01:05:03.233 --> 01:05:06.026
- There's nothing to be frightened of.
- Control yourself, child!

01:05:06.027 --> 01:05:07.027
Don't speak to her like that!

01:05:07.028 --> 01:05:09.446
You're responsible for this.
You and your meddling.

01:05:09.447 --> 01:05:12.157
And so are you. Why didn't
you tell us the truth?

01:05:12.158 --> 01:05:14.535
- I warned you.
- Only of idle gossip.

01:05:14.536 --> 01:05:18.080
Perhaps you'd like your money back. You
shall have it, the entire purchase price.

01:05:18.081 --> 01:05:20.666
No, thank you, Commander.
I know this now:

01:05:20.667 --> 01:05:22.793
Stella will never be well
until this house is cured.

01:05:22.794 --> 01:05:24.253
Somehow we're going to cure it.

01:05:24.254 --> 01:05:28.109
Dr. Scott, have the
goodness to drive us home.

01:05:30.510 --> 01:05:33.238
There. Now you'll sleep all right.

01:05:36.933 --> 01:05:38.767
I'll be here early in the morning.

01:05:38.768 --> 01:05:41.145
Stella is no longer
your patient. Nor am I.

01:05:41.146 --> 01:05:45.843
- But someone must look after her.
- That is not your concern, Dr. Scott.

01:05:51.531 --> 01:05:55.386
- I shall be at your disposal at any hour.
- Thank you.

01:05:57.036 --> 01:05:59.810
Everything will be all right.

01:06:04.544 --> 01:06:07.113
Won't you come in, Miss Holloway?

01:06:10.216 --> 01:06:12.739
- Is she asleep?
- Not yet.

01:06:22.103 --> 01:06:23.830
Hello, Stella.

01:06:24.689 --> 01:06:26.086
Miss Holloway.

01:06:27.150 --> 01:06:28.797
Go to sleep, Stella.

01:06:36.868 --> 01:06:39.661
Dr. Scott tells me she went
into a trance tonight.

01:06:39.662 --> 01:06:41.830
Spoke some words they
thought were Spanish.

01:06:41.831 --> 01:06:43.790
How did she happen
to be at Windward?

01:06:43.791 --> 01:06:46.752
The people who bought the place
are searching into its past.

01:06:46.753 --> 01:06:49.755
- Are they indeed?
- Can you make the child well again?

01:06:49.756 --> 01:06:51.215
I hope so.

01:06:51.216 --> 01:06:54.927
It won't be a short process.
She's far more ill than you imagine.

01:06:54.928 --> 01:06:58.639
She won't want to go with you.
She's never outgrown her fear of you.

01:06:58.640 --> 01:07:01.725
I could've cured it years ago
if you'd let me have her...

01:07:01.726 --> 01:07:03.393
as Mary would have wished me to.

01:07:03.394 --> 01:07:07.272
Her place was in Mary's home. I've
taught her to be like Mary in every way.

01:07:07.273 --> 01:07:11.068
- How can you say such a thing?
- She's not so beautiful, of course.

01:07:11.069 --> 01:07:13.070
Mary was a goddess.

01:07:13.071 --> 01:07:16.471
Her skin was radiant,
and that bright, bright hair.

01:07:17.700 --> 01:07:20.644
How this room brings
her back to me.

01:07:21.120 --> 01:07:23.413
The nights we sat talking in
front of that fireplace...

01:07:23.414 --> 01:07:25.582
planning our whole lives.

01:07:25.583 --> 01:07:28.627
It wasn't flirtations and
dresses we talked about.

01:07:28.628 --> 01:07:31.713
We were no silly, giggling girls.

01:07:31.714 --> 01:07:35.801
- We intended to conquer life.
- You at least did.

01:07:35.802 --> 01:07:38.512
Will you try to take
Mary's place with her now?

01:07:38.513 --> 01:07:40.991
I'll do my best.

01:07:41.975 --> 01:07:43.976
She's asleep.

01:07:43.977 --> 01:07:46.812
If you'll call my chauffeur,
he'll carry her downstairs.

01:07:46.813 --> 01:07:49.837
It will be better for her
to wake at my place.

01:07:50.608 --> 01:07:53.006
I'm deeply grateful to you.

01:07:56.864 --> 01:07:59.592
So they're searching into the past.

01:08:03.621 --> 01:08:06.373
They shan't ever find
out, my darling.

01:08:06.374 --> 01:08:08.351
I promise you.

01:08:11.254 --> 01:08:15.340
- Elizabeth Flynn, where are yez?
- I'm here, Mr. Roderick.

01:08:15.341 --> 01:08:18.635
And will you please
come here at once?

01:08:18.636 --> 01:08:21.721
Don't we get any breakfast?
What's the matter?

01:08:21.723 --> 01:08:24.933
Oh, that. That happened last night.

01:08:24.934 --> 01:08:27.477
I am not talking about that.

01:08:27.478 --> 01:08:30.772
- I'm talking about this.
- The anagram letters. Yes, yes.

01:08:30.773 --> 01:08:32.524
Anagrams, is it?

01:08:32.524 --> 01:08:35.652
Don't you try to bluff
me, Mr. Roderick.

01:08:35.653 --> 01:08:38.071
'Tis a heathen device to
call devils out of hell.

01:08:38.072 --> 01:08:40.490
Stop looking at me as though you
were gonna take away my bicycle.

01:08:40.491 --> 01:08:44.536
I will not stay in a house where it
goes on, and that is an "ultimato"!

01:08:44.537 --> 01:08:48.624
Come now, Lizzie. From now on
we're through with all this rubbish.

01:08:48.625 --> 01:08:51.251
- We're going after facts.
- What facts?

01:08:51.252 --> 01:08:53.045
The facts about this
blasted haunting.

01:08:53.046 --> 01:08:55.671
Rick, why burden Lizzie with this?

01:08:55.673 --> 01:08:59.216
Whist now, Miss Pam.
Where will we start, Mr. Rick?

01:08:59.218 --> 01:09:01.261
I don't know. Everybody
seems to be dead.

01:09:01.261 --> 01:09:04.014
- The trained nurse isn't.
- What trained nurse?

01:09:04.015 --> 01:09:07.392
She was here when it happened... the friend
of the lady that went over the cliff.

01:09:07.393 --> 01:09:09.269
Where did you hear all this?

01:09:09.270 --> 01:09:12.773
What do you suppose we
talk of at the Jessups?

01:09:12.774 --> 01:09:16.068
It was the trained nurse that shouted
down to Mr. Jessup on the shore.

01:09:16.069 --> 01:09:19.613
- Was Jessup in on the tragedy?
- He was after some lost sheep.

01:09:19.613 --> 01:09:21.698
The tide was out, so he went down.

01:09:21.698 --> 01:09:24.910
And as he passed under the
dead tree, he heard a scream.

01:09:24.911 --> 01:09:26.370
- Mrs. Meredith?
- No.

01:09:26.371 --> 01:09:29.081
'Twas the scream of
a terrified child.

01:09:29.082 --> 01:09:33.001
As he ran towards it, the
poor lady came crashing down.

01:09:33.002 --> 01:09:37.296
- 'Twas then that the nurse called.
- Lizzie Flynn, you're a gold mine.

01:09:37.298 --> 01:09:42.029
- If we could only get the name of the nurse.
- Ah, that's easy. Wait, now.

01:09:43.638 --> 01:09:46.473
- Mr. Jessup?
- Yes, Mrs. Flynn.

01:09:46.474 --> 01:09:49.184
What was the name of
Mrs. Meredith's trained nurse...

01:09:49.185 --> 01:09:51.435
the one that got so
famous and grand?

01:09:51.437 --> 01:09:55.857
- Miss Holloway.
- Aye. Miss Holloway.

01:09:55.858 --> 01:09:59.152
She has a big, fine place of
her own now. A hospital, like.

01:09:59.153 --> 01:10:04.635
'Tis on Bodmin Moor. She calls
it the Mary Meredith Retreat.

01:10:14.252 --> 01:10:16.920
- Mr. and Miss Fitzgerald?
- Yes.

01:10:16.921 --> 01:10:19.649
- Won't you come in?
- Thank you.

01:10:25.513 --> 01:10:30.119
Wait in there, please, and I will
announce you to Miss Holloway.

01:10:48.202 --> 01:10:50.976
The place is quite
stunning, isn't it?

01:10:51.622 --> 01:10:55.022
- Why are you whispering?
- Why are you?

01:11:16.814 --> 01:11:18.815
A gentleman!

01:11:18.816 --> 01:11:22.068
- How very unusual.
- Good afternoon.

01:11:22.069 --> 01:11:25.697
Oh, dear me. Yes. Good afternoon.

01:11:25.698 --> 01:11:27.846
Good afternoon.

01:11:30.703 --> 01:11:33.872
Are you by any chance waiting
to see Miss Holloway?

01:11:33.873 --> 01:11:36.192
Yes, we have an appointment.

01:11:36.626 --> 01:11:38.627
What lucky people!

01:11:38.628 --> 01:11:42.964
And what luck for me too, because
I'm sure you won't mind.

01:11:42.965 --> 01:11:46.134
- But perhaps you will.
- Is there something we can do?

01:11:46.135 --> 01:11:49.679
Oh, if you'd be so
very kind. You see...

01:11:49.680 --> 01:11:54.911
this isn't my day for an interview
and I want her to have these.

01:11:56.521 --> 01:11:59.420
What are they, bird's eggs?

01:12:00.233 --> 01:12:05.635
But that's very funny, because,
you see, I'm Miss Bird.

01:12:10.952 --> 01:12:13.829
They're just little stones...

01:12:13.830 --> 01:12:20.043
because she likes simple things
and she has so many flowers.

01:12:20.044 --> 01:12:24.548
- There isn't much else one can find.
- Well, I'll give them to her.

01:12:24.549 --> 01:12:26.132
Thank you.

01:12:26.133 --> 01:12:30.454
And now, I... think I'll just
go out for a little walk.

01:12:34.559 --> 01:12:38.084
Go back to your work
at once, Miss Bird.

01:12:41.566 --> 01:12:43.525
Don't forget.

01:12:43.526 --> 01:12:46.254
Will you come this way, please?

01:12:47.613 --> 01:12:51.074
- Shall I take them?
- No, I'll deliver them.

01:12:51.075 --> 01:12:53.143
As you wish.

01:12:58.708 --> 01:13:00.401
Come in.

01:13:03.838 --> 01:13:05.338
- How do you do?
- How do you do?

01:13:05.339 --> 01:13:07.048
This is so kind of you.

01:13:07.049 --> 01:13:10.010
I was asked to give you these
by a Miss Bird, I believe.

01:13:10.011 --> 01:13:12.721
Poor Miss Bird. Our saddest case.

01:13:12.722 --> 01:13:15.098
They're really very fine
stones, aren't they?

01:13:15.099 --> 01:13:17.058
I must remember to
thank her for them.

01:13:17.059 --> 01:13:19.603
She comes to me once a
week for a little chat.

01:13:19.604 --> 01:13:21.438
- Won't you sit down?
- Thank you.

01:13:21.439 --> 01:13:25.025
Forgive our ignorance. We know
so very little of your work.

01:13:25.026 --> 01:13:27.110
Is it with mental patients?

01:13:27.111 --> 01:13:30.196
Not patients, Miss Fitzgerald.
Just guests.

01:13:30.197 --> 01:13:32.365
In a way this is like a hotel...

01:13:32.366 --> 01:13:35.076
where there are beautiful things
to look at, music to hear...

01:13:35.077 --> 01:13:37.287
and a little sympathy.

01:13:37.288 --> 01:13:39.811
But don't let's talk about me.

01:13:40.791 --> 01:13:44.461
You told me on the telephone
about disturbances at Windward.

01:13:44.462 --> 01:13:45.879
How can I help you?

01:13:45.880 --> 01:13:50.425
We thought perhaps you could tell us
what Mary and Carmel were really like.

01:13:50.426 --> 01:13:53.530
They were extraordinary
women, both of them.

01:13:53.930 --> 01:13:57.015
Mary Meredith was the finest
human being I ever knew.

01:13:57.016 --> 01:13:59.893
- Is that she?
- Yes.

01:13:59.894 --> 01:14:03.980
- And Carmel?
- Oh, she was exceptional too.

01:14:03.981 --> 01:14:06.816
I never saw such intensity of evil.

01:14:06.817 --> 01:14:10.862
She was a Spanish gypsy.
Crafty, cruel.

01:14:10.863 --> 01:14:14.491
- I'm sorry.
- Why did Mrs. Meredith put up with it?

01:14:14.492 --> 01:14:17.410
She thought Meredith should
be the one to end the affair.

01:14:17.411 --> 01:14:19.746
- And did he?
- Yes, in time.

01:14:19.747 --> 01:14:21.915
She and Meredith
took the girl to Paris...

01:14:21.916 --> 01:14:25.293
found a position for her, left
her well supplied with money.

01:14:25.294 --> 01:14:28.046
Then they came back
here with their baby.

01:14:28.047 --> 01:14:31.424
For a time it seemed as if there
were some possibility of happiness.

01:14:31.425 --> 01:14:34.678
- And then?
- Carmel came back.

01:14:34.679 --> 01:14:39.724
She still wanted Mary's husband.
You know how it ended.

01:14:39.725 --> 01:14:43.186
A neighbor of ours spoke of something
we can't quite understand.

01:14:43.187 --> 01:14:45.730
He mentions a child crying
on the cliff that night.

01:14:45.731 --> 01:14:48.129
A terrified child.

01:14:49.777 --> 01:14:54.906
That's a part of the story so ugly,
I've never mentioned it before.

01:14:54.907 --> 01:14:57.430
We're sorry to distress you.

01:14:58.577 --> 01:15:02.539
That night, the girl Carmel had
been told she must leave Windward.

01:15:02.540 --> 01:15:06.334
If she could've killed both Mary and
her husband, she'd have done so.

01:15:06.335 --> 01:15:09.379
A better plan flashed into
her wicked little brain.

01:15:09.380 --> 01:15:12.966
She went into the nursery, picked up
their baby, and raced to the cliff.

01:15:12.967 --> 01:15:15.593
- Good heavens!
- Mary was after her in a second...

01:15:15.594 --> 01:15:20.825
Meredith and I close behind. Carmel
reached the cliff by the dead tree.

01:15:21.267 --> 01:15:24.102
For a moment I saw
them struggling...

01:15:24.103 --> 01:15:27.897
then Carmel raised her arm
and struck Mary down.

01:15:27.898 --> 01:15:29.607
Then it was murder?

01:15:29.608 --> 01:15:31.860
The will to kill had always
been there, I think.

01:15:31.861 --> 01:15:35.905
Directed against Stella.
Can that be what survives?

01:15:35.906 --> 01:15:39.034
Maybe that accounts for Stella's
queer business on the cliff.

01:15:39.035 --> 01:15:40.952
- What was that?
- Something in that house...

01:15:40.953 --> 01:15:45.040
drove her out toward the edge, and if
I hadn't caught her, she'd have gone over.

01:15:45.041 --> 01:15:47.235
Would she indeed?

01:15:48.377 --> 01:15:50.003
How very curious.

01:15:50.004 --> 01:15:52.527
Please, finish your story.

01:15:53.883 --> 01:15:55.925
It was finished.

01:15:55.926 --> 01:15:58.428
Everything was finished.

01:15:58.429 --> 01:16:00.702
Meredith went down the cliff.

01:16:02.183 --> 01:16:05.143
Mary was dead when he reached her.

01:16:05.144 --> 01:16:08.563
- And Carmel?
- She ran out into the storm.

01:16:08.564 --> 01:16:12.817
Next morning, she crawled back
in the early stages of pneumonia.

01:16:12.818 --> 01:16:16.780
I fought for Carmel's
life day and night...

01:16:16.781 --> 01:16:19.240
hating her all the time!

01:16:19.241 --> 01:16:21.409
How awful for you.

01:16:21.410 --> 01:16:28.064
I'm sorry, I discipline others.
I... I can't discipline myself.

01:16:30.252 --> 01:16:34.172
There. Have I told you
everything you want to know?

01:16:34.173 --> 01:16:36.049
All except one thing.

01:16:36.050 --> 01:16:39.052
That last night, who
told Carmel she must go?

01:16:39.053 --> 01:16:42.472
Why, Mary... I should say Meredith.

01:16:42.473 --> 01:16:45.892
It's the one decent thing
I ever knew him to do.

01:16:45.893 --> 01:16:48.997
This... This is all extremely...

01:16:50.189 --> 01:16:52.132
I'm sorry.

01:16:53.067 --> 01:16:55.443
May I offer you tea?

01:16:55.444 --> 01:16:58.238
Thank you, but we must get
back before our maid leaves.

01:16:58.239 --> 01:17:00.698
She won't stay at
Windward after dark.

01:17:00.699 --> 01:17:03.159
I'm afraid I haven't been
much help with your problem.

01:17:03.160 --> 01:17:05.787
Well, thank you
anyway, and good-bye.

01:17:05.788 --> 01:17:08.391
- Good-bye.
- Good-bye.

01:17:32.523 --> 01:17:34.842
Good afternoon, my dear.

01:17:36.652 --> 01:17:39.904
- Did you want to see me?
- I've been asking for you all day.

01:17:39.905 --> 01:17:42.157
I'm being treated as
though I were insane.

01:17:42.158 --> 01:17:44.075
Has anyone used that word?

01:17:44.076 --> 01:17:47.370
- I've told them a thousand times...
- It isn't a question of a word.

01:17:47.371 --> 01:17:50.748
My door's kept locked, and there's
a queer look in their eyes.

01:17:50.749 --> 01:17:55.378
- Oh, you feel persecuted.
- No.

01:17:55.379 --> 01:17:58.673
About the cliff at
Windward, Stella...

01:17:58.674 --> 01:18:01.778
what did you feel as
you ran toward it?

01:18:02.303 --> 01:18:04.762
I didn't feel anything.

01:18:04.763 --> 01:18:06.681
I was sad in the house.

01:18:06.682 --> 01:18:09.392
Was it as though some will
were directing you...

01:18:09.393 --> 01:18:15.315
- a will stronger than yours?
- The sea sounded loud and beautiful.

01:18:15.316 --> 01:18:19.027
- I just went in that direction.
- In fact, you don't quite know.

01:18:19.028 --> 01:18:22.322
- I want to see my grandfather.
- You will in time.

01:18:22.323 --> 01:18:26.098
Does Grandfather know
what this place is like?

01:18:26.869 --> 01:18:29.037
That woman who laughs...

01:18:29.038 --> 01:18:32.081
I hear laughing all night!
And that other woman that...

01:18:32.082 --> 01:18:34.709
Your grandfather's sorry
that you have to be here...

01:18:34.710 --> 01:18:37.337
but he knows you'll be better soon.

01:18:37.338 --> 01:18:40.548
"Better"? But I'm
perfectly all right!

01:18:40.549 --> 01:18:43.259
I wouldn't say that, Stella dear.

01:18:43.260 --> 01:18:46.054
And please don't keep
asking to see me.

01:18:46.055 --> 01:18:49.182
Why do you hate me, Miss Holloway?

01:18:49.183 --> 01:18:53.413
You see? You do feel persecuted.

01:19:05.741 --> 01:19:08.034
Rick, if I should ever
happen to lose my mind...

01:19:08.035 --> 01:19:11.287
I don't think you'll lose it.
It might rattle to one side.

01:19:11.288 --> 01:19:14.499
But if I do, no Mary
Meredith Retreat for me.

01:19:14.500 --> 01:19:18.795
Plain, old-fashioned lunatic
asylum, not that creepy horror.

01:19:18.796 --> 01:19:22.048
You'll have a lovely talk with
Miss Holloway once a week.

01:19:22.049 --> 01:19:25.260
- You think she was lying to us?
- About the past? Why should she?

01:19:25.261 --> 01:19:28.846
She wasn't gonna tell us about the baby,
and later she made that one break.

01:19:28.847 --> 01:19:31.140
Admitting it was Mary
who told Carmel to go.

01:19:31.141 --> 01:19:34.644
Why try to hide it? It was
a normal human reaction.

01:19:34.645 --> 01:19:37.021
Made me like Mary better,
as a matter of fact.

01:19:37.022 --> 01:19:39.816
I was getting awfully bored
with her perfection.

01:19:39.817 --> 01:19:43.069
Why should Miss Holloway want to
turn her into a plaster saint?

01:19:43.070 --> 01:19:47.490
Maybe she likes plaster saints.
She's one herself.

01:19:47.491 --> 01:19:48.533
Thank you, Doctor.

01:19:48.534 --> 01:19:52.203
I assure you that when that healthy young
man laughs, he isn't being delirious.

01:19:52.204 --> 01:19:54.022
Good-bye, Doctor.

01:19:54.540 --> 01:19:57.359
- Hello. Come in.
- Hello.

01:19:59.211 --> 01:20:02.672
- What news of Stella?
- None, and I won't be having any.

01:20:02.673 --> 01:20:05.883
Her grandfather's kicked me out.
Where have you been all day?

01:20:05.884 --> 01:20:08.720
- To Bodmin Moor and back.
- Seeing a Miss Holloway.

01:20:08.721 --> 01:20:11.097
What, Holy Holloway of
"wealth through harmony"?

01:20:11.098 --> 01:20:13.641
- What do you know about her?
- Nothing, except that...

01:20:13.642 --> 01:20:16.811
Dr. Rudd, my predecessor, had some
sort of prejudice against her.

01:20:16.812 --> 01:20:19.022
She says Carmel
killed Mary Meredith.

01:20:19.023 --> 01:20:20.982
Yes, she was there.
Nursed Carmel afterwards.

01:20:20.983 --> 01:20:25.259
- Could we talk to Dr. Rudd about her?
- Only if we have another séance.

01:20:25.779 --> 01:20:27.864
- I wonder...
- What?

01:20:27.865 --> 01:20:32.391
It's only the very faintest chance,
of course, but come on upstairs.

01:20:35.080 --> 01:20:38.708
190s to '11, '12 to
'15, '16 to '19.

01:20:38.709 --> 01:20:40.168
Here we are.

01:20:40.169 --> 01:20:43.963
- It happened in the winter.
- Yes, let's start with November.

01:20:43.964 --> 01:20:46.841
From his handwriting, Dr. Rudd
must have been 200 years old.

01:20:46.842 --> 01:20:51.554
Measles, measles, measles, whooping
cough, measles, appendicitis...

01:20:51.555 --> 01:20:54.098
Pleasant change for the old boy.

01:20:54.099 --> 01:20:56.934
Here we are. "Called
to Windward House.

01:20:56.935 --> 01:21:00.146
Meredith's model, Carmel
Quesada: double pneumonia."

01:21:00.147 --> 01:21:03.649
"Quesada girl much worse. No
attempt to warm the bedroom.

01:21:03.650 --> 01:21:07.737
- Found traces of snow on the floor."
- Snow? Then the window was left open.

01:21:07.738 --> 01:21:09.572
"Spoke severely to nurse.

01:21:09.573 --> 01:21:13.117
Returned to Windward this
evening. Patient dead.

01:21:13.118 --> 01:21:15.745
Nurse Holloway threatened
me with legal action...

01:21:15.746 --> 01:21:18.539
when I used the words
'criminal negligence."

01:21:18.540 --> 01:21:20.708
- But that means...
- To a doctor of Rudd's generation...

01:21:20.709 --> 01:21:22.460
it was apt to mean murder.

01:21:22.461 --> 01:21:25.213
- Miss Holloway murdered Carmel.
- Doctor.

01:21:25.214 --> 01:21:27.715
- In a quiet, ladylike way.
- Doctor!

01:21:27.716 --> 01:21:28.758
Yes, Edith?

01:21:28.759 --> 01:21:32.512
The commander's maid's on the
phone. You're to come at once.

01:21:32.513 --> 01:21:34.972
- Is it Miss Meredith?
- It's the commander.

01:21:34.973 --> 01:21:39.060
- Took awful bad, the maid says.
- All right, Edith. You take this home.

01:21:39.061 --> 01:21:42.461
There may be some other details.
I'll be along later.

01:21:44.525 --> 01:21:46.627
He's in here, Doctor.

01:21:48.987 --> 01:21:52.591
I undid his shoes. It was
all I knew how to do.

01:21:53.450 --> 01:21:57.036
- Bad one this time, Scott.
- Yes, I know.

01:21:57.037 --> 01:21:59.185
Hold that under his nose.

01:22:07.548 --> 01:22:10.174
Want an apology, Scott?

01:22:10.175 --> 01:22:13.469
You'd get it, if you
stuck out for it.

01:22:13.470 --> 01:22:16.870
No, thanks. I'll have
you right in a jiffy.

01:22:20.769 --> 01:22:24.339
- Who's there?
- Who do you suppose is there?

01:22:29.194 --> 01:22:30.570
Hello, Lizzie.

01:22:30.571 --> 01:22:34.031
I'm sitting in your mother's chair,
and if any ghost comes along...

01:22:34.032 --> 01:22:36.701
I'll let out a scream that will
frighten the life out of it.

01:22:36.702 --> 01:22:38.286
Why? What's happened?

01:22:38.287 --> 01:22:41.581
I feel all the wickedness of
this house gathering around.

01:22:41.582 --> 01:22:44.500
- Come on, now. Hop off to the Jessups'.
- I'm not going.

01:22:44.501 --> 01:22:47.003
I'll be found dead in me
bed in the morning...

01:22:47.004 --> 01:22:49.922
stiff with fright, and
me death will be on you.

01:22:49.923 --> 01:22:50.756
Me?

01:22:50.757 --> 01:22:54.093
How do I know what devilment you'll
be up to when me back is turned?

01:22:54.094 --> 01:22:57.388
I promise we'll do nothing tonight
that the priest wouldn't approve of.

01:22:57.389 --> 01:23:01.309
Lord bless you, Mr. Rick.
I was hoping you'd say that.

01:23:01.310 --> 01:23:04.163
I'll go and get me hat and coat.

01:23:07.232 --> 01:23:10.109
- Find anything new?
- Nothing after that entry.

01:23:10.110 --> 01:23:14.636
- How about a whiskey and soda?
- Less soda than usual, thanks.

01:23:18.035 --> 01:23:20.536
Awful if we took to
drink, both of us.

01:23:20.537 --> 01:23:23.039
But it's an ideal house
for delirium tremens.

01:23:23.040 --> 01:23:28.169
Before you take a sip...
don't you smell mimosa?

01:23:28.170 --> 01:23:31.380
Yes. Are you scared?

01:23:31.381 --> 01:23:33.966
Well, I wish I'd wake up.

01:23:33.967 --> 01:23:36.991
It came from the
nursery last night.

01:23:44.770 --> 01:23:49.592
- You have the great nose of the family.
- Not a trace of it now.

01:23:58.325 --> 01:24:01.895
- It's strongest here.
- It's almost overpowering.

01:24:02.371 --> 01:24:04.997
I wish you'd tell us what
you want, Mary Meredith.

01:24:04.998 --> 01:24:06.707
- Mr. Rick?
- Yes?

01:24:06.708 --> 01:24:10.294
I forgot to ask: Did you
find out anything today?

01:24:10.295 --> 01:24:15.242
- Just turned up a couple of murders.
- Holy saints preserve us!

01:24:15.634 --> 01:24:19.455
Answer the door.
It's probably Dr. Scott.

01:24:21.265 --> 01:24:23.391
- Good evening, Dr. Scott.
- Evening, Lizzie.

01:24:23.392 --> 01:24:25.601
- In here.
- Good night, Miss Pam.

01:24:25.602 --> 01:24:27.019
- Good night.
- Good night.

01:24:27.020 --> 01:24:29.605
- I'm glad to find you here.
- How's the commander?

01:24:29.606 --> 01:24:31.774
It's not him I'm worried
about. It's Stella.

01:24:31.775 --> 01:24:34.068
- What's the matter with her?
- She's at Miss Holloway's.

01:24:34.069 --> 01:24:36.821
- No!
- We've got to get her out, tonight.

01:24:36.822 --> 01:24:39.574
That's the way I feel, but
don't let's get hysterical.

01:24:39.575 --> 01:24:41.701
After all, Miss Holloway was
her mother's best friend.

01:24:41.702 --> 01:24:45.037
The idea of her spending an
hour in that place is horrible.

01:24:45.038 --> 01:24:48.249
- Can you get the old boy's permission?
- He's too ill. We've no authority.

01:24:48.250 --> 01:24:50.876
- Then we'll do it without.
- Shall we take the casebook?

01:24:50.877 --> 01:24:53.921
- Might be able to frighten her with it.
- Yes. No, wait.

01:24:53.922 --> 01:24:56.340
We'll describe what we found
and then pile it on, huh?

01:24:56.341 --> 01:24:58.443
Let's get to a telephone.

01:25:06.310 --> 01:25:07.957
Yes?

01:25:10.564 --> 01:25:14.942
Oh, it's no bother at all, Miss Fitzgerald.
I'll be glad to see you again.

01:25:14.943 --> 01:25:16.920
Are you motoring?

01:25:17.321 --> 01:25:19.405
In two hours.

01:25:19.406 --> 01:25:21.179
Good-bye.

01:25:27.539 --> 01:25:29.937
Bring in Miss Meredith.

01:25:33.253 --> 01:25:35.947
I may need the car this evening.

01:25:53.106 --> 01:25:56.506
Good evening, my dear. Come in.

01:25:59.988 --> 01:26:01.761
Sit down.

01:26:03.200 --> 01:26:05.493
I thought you'd feel
more at home here.

01:26:05.494 --> 01:26:07.203
I do, Miss Holloway.

01:26:07.204 --> 01:26:10.081
I've been giving your problem
the most serious consideration.

01:26:10.082 --> 01:26:13.751
It's not much of a problem.
I just want to go home.

01:26:13.752 --> 01:26:16.295
To your grandfather's?

01:26:16.296 --> 01:26:21.217
I couldn't permit that.
You've never been very happy there.

01:26:21.218 --> 01:26:25.346
- Where would you really like to be?
- You mean Windward?

01:26:25.347 --> 01:26:30.578
That's the basis of all your
trouble, being kept away from there.

01:26:32.104 --> 01:26:37.817
- Do you think she wants you there?
- Yes, I think she does.

01:26:37.818 --> 01:26:41.297
And what she wants, I want.

01:26:42.280 --> 01:26:45.241
I've talked with the Fitzgeralds.
They're very fond of you.

01:26:45.242 --> 01:26:47.410
They'll let me stay
there with them?

01:26:47.411 --> 01:26:51.080
For the present, your grandfather's
not to know you've left here.

01:26:51.081 --> 01:26:53.082
It would worry him.

01:26:53.083 --> 01:26:56.232
You must go straight to Windward.

01:26:56.962 --> 01:26:58.754
Is that clear?

01:26:58.755 --> 01:27:03.201
Miss Holloway, I'm the
happiest person in the world!

01:27:04.428 --> 01:27:06.906
There's a train in 40 minutes.

01:27:07.597 --> 01:27:10.325
My car will take you
to the station.

01:27:23.113 --> 01:27:25.807
Good evening. Won't you come in?

01:27:27.409 --> 01:27:31.935
- I must announce you!
- Don't bother. We'll announce ourselves.

01:27:36.793 --> 01:27:39.628
Good evening. So you've
thought of more questions?

01:27:39.629 --> 01:27:43.549
- Why didn't you tell us Stella was here?
- The presence of my guests is confidential.

01:27:43.550 --> 01:27:45.885
- We've come to take her.
- This is Stella's doctor.

01:27:45.886 --> 01:27:50.014
Oh, I begin to understand.
This is a rescue party.

01:27:50.015 --> 01:27:52.183
Take me to Stella at once.

01:27:52.184 --> 01:27:54.810
There was a time when I would have
resented such impertinence...

01:27:54.811 --> 01:27:57.938
particularly from a doctor whose
conduct leaves so much to be desired.

01:27:57.939 --> 01:28:01.942
- Please stop beating about the bush.
- I couldn't be angry with anyone tonight.

01:28:01.943 --> 01:28:05.279
You know, those moments when
the light is very clear...

01:28:05.280 --> 01:28:08.908
when the scales at last
swing into perfect balance.

01:28:08.909 --> 01:28:12.244
- Where is Stella?
- Tell them, Miss Ellis.

01:28:12.245 --> 01:28:14.955
She's on the train for
Biddlecombe. The 9:20.

01:28:14.956 --> 01:28:17.605
On her way home.

01:28:18.001 --> 01:28:20.795
- Is that true?
- She'll be there long before you.

01:28:20.796 --> 01:28:22.588
- What happened?
- Nothing.

01:28:22.589 --> 01:28:26.759
She wasn't very happy here. I can't be
of any help to people who are unhappy.

01:28:26.760 --> 01:28:29.094
- She went to her grandfather's?
- No.

01:28:29.095 --> 01:28:31.847
- Not to Windward House?
- Better than that.

01:28:31.848 --> 01:28:34.767
To the cliff, and the
rocks below the cliff.

01:28:34.768 --> 01:28:36.101
You let her?

01:28:36.102 --> 01:28:40.439
That's were Mary went.
That's where she died.

01:28:40.440 --> 01:28:43.818
She's out of her mind. Come on!
Stella has a 20-minute start!

01:28:43.819 --> 01:28:46.695
The sea has such a lonely sauna.

01:28:46.696 --> 01:28:48.823
- Every seventh wave...
- You'd better look after her.

01:28:48.824 --> 01:28:52.409
Miss Holloway! What's the matter?

01:28:52.410 --> 01:28:54.808
Get out of this room!

01:28:56.665 --> 01:28:59.333
I've done what she wanted at last.

01:28:59.334 --> 01:29:01.544
Haven't I, Mary?

01:29:01.545 --> 01:29:04.114
It's all straight now.

01:29:04.506 --> 01:29:09.218
There are no frayed edges.
No loose ends.

01:29:09.219 --> 01:29:11.242
All straight.

01:29:11.680 --> 01:29:13.282
All smooth.

01:29:18.687 --> 01:29:22.606
These local trains are very slow, you know.
But this one had a head start.

01:29:22.607 --> 01:29:25.234
You needn't worry. She
can't get into the house.

01:29:25.235 --> 01:29:29.511
- You did lock the door, didn't you, Pam?
- No, I thought you did.

01:29:40.250 --> 01:29:42.334
- Will you be all right, miss?
- Oh, yes.

01:29:42.335 --> 01:29:45.609
I'll be all right now.
I'll be with my friends.

01:30:18.079 --> 01:30:20.773
Pamela? Rick?

01:30:26.630 --> 01:30:28.858
Pamela, are you there?

01:30:30.842 --> 01:30:32.569
Rick?

01:30:38.850 --> 01:30:41.044
Where are you? Please.

01:30:59.329 --> 01:31:01.330
Lizzie?

01:31:01.331 --> 01:31:03.229
Is that you?

01:31:16.262 --> 01:31:18.114
Stella.

01:31:22.686 --> 01:31:24.538
Stella.

01:31:30.902 --> 01:31:33.529
Grandfather! Grandfather!

01:31:33.530 --> 01:31:35.948
Stella, my child.

01:31:35.949 --> 01:31:38.993
What's the matter?
What are you doing here?

01:31:38.994 --> 01:31:42.496
Someone telephoned...
from Miss Holloway's.

01:31:42.497 --> 01:31:45.249
And you walked all that way?

01:31:45.250 --> 01:31:47.209
Well, I had to get here.

01:31:47.210 --> 01:31:50.838
Don't try and talk, darling.
I'll get Dr. Scott.

01:31:50.839 --> 01:31:53.340
Oh, dear. There's no
telephone in this house.

01:31:53.341 --> 01:31:56.635
- Go. Go!
- You can't be left alone.

01:31:56.636 --> 01:31:59.054
But the danger is for you.

01:31:59.055 --> 01:32:02.766
- Please get out of this house now.
- Now lie back quietly.

01:32:02.767 --> 01:32:04.869
I'm not afraid of anything here.

01:32:06.354 --> 01:32:11.191
Then be afraid. Be afraid,
for heaven's sake.

01:32:11.192 --> 01:32:15.237
When you were a little child...
after her death...

01:32:15.238 --> 01:32:18.449
the evils of this house
reached out for you.

01:32:18.450 --> 01:32:20.868
I took you away then.

01:32:20.869 --> 01:32:25.850
- If I could only take you now.
- It's all right. We're together.

01:32:36.843 --> 01:32:39.636
Stella! Go!

01:32:39.637 --> 01:32:42.240
- Go...
- Grandfather!

01:32:52.859 --> 01:32:55.382
I won't be afraid, Mother.

01:33:05.705 --> 01:33:07.478
Stella!

01:33:10.085 --> 01:33:11.732
Stella!

01:33:13.463 --> 01:33:15.657
Stella, stop!

01:33:21.179 --> 01:33:23.077
Hold on, darling.

01:33:26.559 --> 01:33:29.629
We've got you now,
darling. Hang on.

01:33:35.318 --> 01:33:37.069
- Are you all right?
- Yes.

01:33:37.070 --> 01:33:38.487
Sure?

01:33:38.488 --> 01:33:42.699
Dr. Scott, Grandfather's in
the studio. He's terribly ill.

01:33:42.700 --> 01:33:45.269
We'd better get to him at once.

01:33:54.003 --> 01:33:56.046
There's nothing I can do, my dear.

01:33:56.047 --> 01:33:57.774
I knew.

01:33:59.134 --> 01:34:02.469
She killed him just as
she tried to kill me.

01:34:02.470 --> 01:34:04.930
- My own mother!
- No, Stella.

01:34:04.931 --> 01:34:07.975
But I tell you, I saw my mother
just as my father painted her.

01:34:07.976 --> 01:34:10.686
- It must have been Carmel.
- It wasn't.

01:34:10.687 --> 01:34:12.437
Steady, Stella.

01:34:12.438 --> 01:34:14.256
Unless...

01:34:14.816 --> 01:34:18.026
Unless perhaps Miss
Holloway was right.

01:34:18.027 --> 01:34:20.904
Perhaps it's my mind.

01:34:20.905 --> 01:34:23.133
- Oh, Rick!
- No, darling.

01:34:27.245 --> 01:34:29.705
The mimosa scent...
it's flooding the room.

01:34:29.706 --> 01:34:31.498
It's all right, darling.
Nothing will hurt you.

01:34:31.499 --> 01:34:36.545
But I'm not frightened. This is what
I felt in the nursery that night.

01:34:36.546 --> 01:34:38.380
The book!

01:34:38.381 --> 01:34:40.382
What's doing it?

01:34:40.383 --> 01:34:43.886
- The wind.
- But what about the mimosa?

01:34:43.887 --> 01:34:47.639
We're letting our imaginations
play hob with our senses.

01:34:47.640 --> 01:34:53.145
"11:15 a.m. Mary Ann Hardy.
Broken arm. Second this year."

01:34:53.146 --> 01:34:55.544
It's imagination, all right.

01:34:57.442 --> 01:35:01.153
- Oh, what did I expect?
- Wait a minute.

01:35:01.154 --> 01:35:03.363
"3:20 p.m. Called to
Windward House...

01:35:03.364 --> 01:35:05.949
to attend Meredith's
model, who had fainted.

01:35:05.950 --> 01:35:09.224
It didn't take much skill
to find the reason.

01:35:09.662 --> 01:35:11.455
Girl in poor physical condition...

01:35:11.456 --> 01:35:14.666
but I'm sure her great happiness
will carry her through."

01:35:14.667 --> 01:35:18.921
- Then Carmel had a baby too!
- "5:10 p.m. Mrs. Meredith came to see me.

01:35:18.922 --> 01:35:22.633
Expected tears, hysteria.
Instead, icy control...

01:35:22.634 --> 01:35:26.011
and a dominating desire that the
girl's condition be kept secret.

01:35:26.012 --> 01:35:29.806
I should have more sympathy with the lady
if I did not know how she herself...

01:35:29.807 --> 01:35:32.726
has feared and refused motherhood."

01:35:32.727 --> 01:35:34.603
What can it all mean?

01:35:34.604 --> 01:35:37.105
- Where were you born, Stella?
- In Paris.

01:35:37.106 --> 01:35:40.359
Where they took Carmel before
they came back with their baby.

01:35:40.360 --> 01:35:44.446
- But surely you don't think...
- I think Mary adopted Carmel's child...

01:35:44.447 --> 01:35:47.491
gave her a home on the condition
that Carmel never came back.

01:35:47.492 --> 01:35:50.118
Only she couldn't live up to it.
She had to be near her baby.

01:35:50.119 --> 01:35:52.496
But it doesn't fit.
The mimosa scent...

01:35:52.497 --> 01:35:55.290
that comes with the gentle
ghost, that was Mary's scent.

01:35:55.291 --> 01:35:58.001
- Stella's father told her.
- No.

01:35:58.002 --> 01:36:01.505
No, my father only wrote that
it was my mother's scent.

01:36:01.506 --> 01:36:06.510
- I'm Carmel's child!
- Oh, Stella, don't mind too much.

01:36:06.511 --> 01:36:10.013
"Mind"? Can't you see
what it's done for me?

01:36:10.014 --> 01:36:12.432
Always there's been
something fighting in me...

01:36:12.433 --> 01:36:16.228
something that couldn't be
calm and cold like Mary.

01:36:16.229 --> 01:36:18.438
I can be myself now.

01:36:18.439 --> 01:36:21.775
That's what she's waited all
these years to tell you.

01:36:21.776 --> 01:36:25.255
Oh, Mother, now I know.

01:36:34.580 --> 01:36:37.040
She's happy now.

01:36:37.041 --> 01:36:41.545
- The scent's gone.
- She won't cry anymore.

01:36:41.546 --> 01:36:43.505
She's gone forever.

01:36:43.506 --> 01:36:46.591
Will you come back to
my house now, Stella?

01:36:46.592 --> 01:36:49.445
- Come along, darling.
- All right.

01:36:54.058 --> 01:36:57.019
- Get her out through the nursery, quick!
- Right.

01:36:57.020 --> 01:36:58.812
- What is it, the cold?
- Go on, Pam!

01:36:58.813 --> 01:37:02.258
- What are you going to do?
- Help Stella, please.

01:37:13.202 --> 01:37:16.306
Mary Meredith, where are you?

01:37:22.128 --> 01:37:26.214
It's time somebody faced
that icy rage of yours.

01:37:26.215 --> 01:37:28.216
What do you want?

01:37:28.217 --> 01:37:30.115
It's Stella, isn't it?

01:37:40.104 --> 01:37:44.358
It's too late, Mary. You see,
we're on to you now.

01:37:44.359 --> 01:37:48.320
You told Carmel to clear out and leave her
baby, but Meredith wouldn't stand for it.

01:37:48.321 --> 01:37:49.310
To spite them,

01:37:49.336 --> 01:37:53.293
you tried to kill their child and instead
went hurtling over the cliff yourself.

01:37:53.826 --> 01:37:57.396
Gives your saintly legend
a black eye, doesn't it?

01:37:58.623 --> 01:38:01.583
So you don't like the sound
of laughter, do you?

01:38:01.584 --> 01:38:04.528
But that's all you'll
get from now on.

01:38:08.091 --> 01:38:11.134
I should think you'll be on
your way now, Mary Meredith.

01:38:11.135 --> 01:38:14.304
We've had enough. We're not
frightened of you anymore.

01:38:14.305 --> 01:38:17.454
From now on, this house
is for the living.

01:38:31.948 --> 01:38:34.301
Rick, are you all right?

01:38:35.618 --> 01:38:38.016
Let' me in, Rick!

01:38:39.580 --> 01:38:41.206
- Oh, Rick!
- You all right, Fitzgerald?

01:38:41.207 --> 01:38:44.000
Yes, fine. She's gone, Stella.

01:38:44.001 --> 01:38:45.127
Look!

01:38:45.128 --> 01:38:48.422
He'd never go near
those stairs before.

01:38:48.423 --> 01:38:50.549
Bobby'll be back tomorrow.

01:38:50.550 --> 01:38:53.995
I think we'll be having
other plans for Bobby.

01:38:54.929 --> 01:38:58.723
- You're still shaking, Rick.
- Well, I've had a narrow escape.

01:38:58.724 --> 01:39:01.794
She might have been
my mother-in-law!

01:39:02.305 --> 01:39:08.511
