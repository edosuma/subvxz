00:04.869 --> 00:07.434
MAN [over radio]:
Welcome back
to Daily BackTalk,86.9 FM.

00:07.478 --> 00:09.304
I'm your host, Adam Gator.

00:09.347 --> 00:12.043
This morning I am joined
by a very special guest--

00:12.086 --> 00:13.869
Navy Commander
Walter Daniels.

00:13.913 --> 00:17.130
Many loyal listeners of
this show have complained

00:17.173 --> 00:20.739
and questionedwhy we
spend hundreds of billions

00:20.782 --> 00:24.869
sending troops, planes and ships
to protect other countries.

00:24.913 --> 00:26.913
Resources they say
should be here,

00:26.956 --> 00:29.826
protecting and bettering
the homeland.

00:29.869 --> 00:31.043
DANIELS:
They are.

00:31.086 --> 00:33.391
The age of isolationism
is long over.

00:33.434 --> 00:36.478
GATOR:
What about those that complain
about the U.S. having to pay

00:36.521 --> 00:38.434
to be the policemen
of the world?

00:38.478 --> 00:40.478
DANIELS:
American military deployment
around the globe assures

00:40.521 --> 00:42.478
the safety
of free trade for all.

00:42.521 --> 00:45.347
Trade that invariably benefits
our own markets.

00:45.391 --> 00:48.521
Second, we are constantly
eliminating terrorist threats

00:48.565 --> 00:50.826
that may otherwise end up
in our own backyard.

00:50.869 --> 00:53.130
GATOR:
That brings us
to our next topic,

00:53.173 --> 00:56.652
and the main reason
I asked you to be here today.

00:56.695 --> 00:57.826
Right after a word from...

00:57.869 --> 00:59.043
No.

00:59.086 --> 01:00.304
Don't. Don't!

01:00.347 --> 01:01.173
[cries out]
GATOR:
Hey, what are you doing?

01:01.217 --> 01:02.304
GATOR:
Hey, put it down!

01:02.347 --> 01:03.478
Hey. Hey, hey,
you can't be in here.

01:03.521 --> 01:05.043
No. Please!

01:05.086 --> 01:06.347
[gunshot, man cries out]Please don't!

01:06.391 --> 01:07.478
Somebody call 9...

01:07.521 --> 01:09.782
[three gunshots]

01:40.347 --> 01:41.565
[elevator bell dings]

01:41.608 --> 01:43.304
Tony, it's the
world we live in.

01:43.347 --> 01:46.043
The time has come to embrace
change with open arms.

01:46.086 --> 01:48.652
It's either that, or we risk
further controversy and scorn.

01:48.695 --> 01:50.869
For once, I think
you might be right.

01:50.913 --> 01:52.260
You've changed
my McMind.

01:52.304 --> 01:53.391
And I thank you, Tim.

01:53.434 --> 01:54.782
Tony, have you been drinking?

01:54.826 --> 01:56.043
No. [exhales
and sniffs] Why?

01:56.086 --> 01:57.304
I could have
sworn I just

01:57.347 --> 01:59.000
heard you thank McGee.

01:59.043 --> 02:01.000
Oh. I appreciate
his insight.

02:01.043 --> 02:02.086
On what?

02:02.130 --> 02:03.130
Baseball.

02:03.173 --> 02:04.913
McGEE:
Specifically,

02:04.956 --> 02:06.652
the implementation
of instant replay in baseball.

02:06.695 --> 02:09.130
We have the technology,
why not use it?

02:09.173 --> 02:10.434
Bad calls hurt everyone.

02:10.478 --> 02:12.000
I do not know
which is more disturbing--

02:12.043 --> 02:13.217
the fact that you both agree

02:13.260 --> 02:14.565
on something, or that

02:14.608 --> 02:16.782
McGee is a fan of a sport.

02:18.217 --> 02:20.304
It's not just
that I'm a fan, Ziva.

02:20.347 --> 02:22.130
It is also, I'm...

02:22.173 --> 02:22.956
American?

02:23.000 --> 02:24.391
Alive?

02:24.434 --> 02:26.173
It's October, Ziva.

02:26.217 --> 02:28.652
Reggie Jackson is Mr. October.

02:28.695 --> 02:30.565
Baseball has seeped

02:30.608 --> 02:32.347
into the native consciousness
of this country.

02:32.391 --> 02:34.217
I do not feel any seeping.

02:34.260 --> 02:36.695
Well, maybe you just got
to be born here.

02:36.739 --> 02:38.217
Come on, you two.
It's just a game.

02:38.260 --> 02:39.956
It's our game.

02:40.000 --> 02:41.391
If you build it,

02:41.434 --> 02:42.608
they will come.

02:42.652 --> 02:44.565
Field of Dreams.

02:44.608 --> 02:46.782
Maybe that's speaking to
the immigrant experience.

02:46.826 --> 02:49.782
I did not become an American
citizen because of baseball.

02:49.826 --> 02:51.173
It's every kid's dream.

02:51.217 --> 02:53.347
Even McGee.

02:53.391 --> 02:54.826
It's true.
Center fielder.

02:54.869 --> 02:56.347
Right on the list.

02:56.391 --> 02:57.434
Right before Imagineer.

02:57.478 --> 02:59.478
It's a hard day
when you realize

02:59.521 --> 03:00.956
those dreams may not come true.

03:01.000 --> 03:03.565
Got to keep
the dream alive, Tim.

03:03.608 --> 03:05.695
Got three people,
aren't gonna get that chance.

03:07.086 --> 03:08.608
Three strikes.

03:09.782 --> 03:11.652
And you're out.

03:11.695 --> 03:13.913
[indistinct radio transmission]

03:16.000 --> 03:17.652
ZIVA: It looks like
the shooter started in here

03:17.695 --> 03:20.043
before making his way
into the recording booth.

03:20.086 --> 03:22.043
DUCKY: These are not the
kind of hits one expects

03:22.086 --> 03:24.043
to hear on the radio.

03:24.086 --> 03:25.391
ZIVA:
No shell casings anywhere.

03:25.434 --> 03:26.652
Our shooter must have
picked them up.

03:26.695 --> 03:29.217
See, this is why
podcasts were invented.

03:29.260 --> 03:31.130
Who needs the radio
when you got the Internet?

03:31.173 --> 03:32.826
People who don't have
the Internet.

03:32.869 --> 03:36.260
Or those who prefer
to listen while driving.

03:36.304 --> 03:38.521
Ah, they actually make a cell
phone app for that now, Ducky.

03:38.565 --> 03:41.000
Got an app
for doing your job, McGee?

03:41.043 --> 03:42.826
Right.

03:42.869 --> 03:44.869
Virginia State
Police found

03:44.913 --> 03:47.391
the bodies when local
listeners called in, hearing

03:47.434 --> 03:48.826
gunshots live on the air.

03:48.869 --> 03:50.043
Anybody see what happened?

03:50.086 --> 03:51.608
No witnesses.

03:51.652 --> 03:53.130
It's a small
rural station,

03:53.173 --> 03:54.695
and the only
registered employee

03:54.739 --> 03:56.521
is our body in the
engineering booth--

03:56.565 --> 03:57.826
Vincent Clark.

03:57.869 --> 03:59.608
Local poly-sci major.

03:59.652 --> 04:01.347
How about the navy officer?

04:01.391 --> 04:03.695
McGEE:
That is Commander
Walter Daniels.

04:03.739 --> 04:04.782
He's a Special Duty Officer

04:04.826 --> 04:06.521
in the Office of
Public Affairs.

04:06.565 --> 04:08.478
Big fish for a small station.

04:08.521 --> 04:11.043
Mm. Big crime scene
for a small town.

04:11.086 --> 04:13.043
So, what's the commander doing
way out here in the boonies?

04:13.086 --> 04:14.826
McGEE:
Well, according to
a press release,

04:14.869 --> 04:16.608
Daniels was asked
to give an interview

04:16.652 --> 04:17.913
on foreign military policy.

04:17.956 --> 04:19.652
Asked... by whom?

04:19.695 --> 04:23.217
King of Zing himself--
radio host Adam Gator.

04:23.260 --> 04:24.565
Married. No kids.

04:24.608 --> 04:26.434
Been on the air
three years.

04:26.478 --> 04:28.043
Articulate conversation

04:28.086 --> 04:30.695
from intelligent guests
like the commander was not

04:30.739 --> 04:32.826
the show's usual fare.

04:32.869 --> 04:34.695
You're not a fan
of BackTalk,Duck?

04:34.739 --> 04:36.782
People calling in
to be mocked and berated

04:36.826 --> 04:38.000
by a smart-aleck host?

04:38.043 --> 04:39.391
No.

04:39.434 --> 04:41.391
Neither, it would appear,
was our shooter.

04:41.434 --> 04:44.260
The engineer and the commander
were shot once,

04:44.304 --> 04:45.782
and then,
judging by the pooling,

04:45.826 --> 04:47.434
left to bleed to death.

04:47.478 --> 04:48.956
Yeah, well,
the host is a different story.

04:49.000 --> 04:50.608
DUCKY:
Indeed.

04:50.652 --> 04:53.347
Adam Gator here was
shot three times,

04:53.391 --> 04:55.739
all in the chest.

04:55.782 --> 04:57.347
Means that Gator
was the primary target.

04:57.391 --> 04:59.521
Why kill him live
on the air, though?

04:59.565 --> 05:01.173
DUCKY:
Perhaps the shooter was

05:01.217 --> 05:03.434
looking for an audience,
as well.

05:03.478 --> 05:06.652
[montage of radio
sound effects play loudly]

05:06.695 --> 05:08.913
MAN [recording]:
86.9 FM, home of Daily BackTalk

05:08.956 --> 05:11.304
with Adam Gator.

05:11.347 --> 05:12.260
[recording stops]

05:12.304 --> 05:13.826
TONY:
Sorry, boss.

05:13.869 --> 05:16.521
I hit the wrong button.

05:16.565 --> 05:18.782
You know, I considered
going into radio once.

05:18.826 --> 05:22.000
Hmm. Well, you certainly
like to hear yourself talk.

05:22.043 --> 05:23.304
[both laughing]

05:23.347 --> 05:26.086
No. Not talk radio.

05:26.130 --> 05:28.217
I think I would have been
a great sports commentator.

05:28.260 --> 05:30.000
Mm.
Jack Buck, Vin Scully.

05:30.043 --> 05:32.173
Harry Caray.

05:32.217 --> 05:33.695
Cubs win! Cubs win!

05:33.739 --> 05:35.869
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

05:35.913 --> 05:37.086
[laughs]

05:37.130 --> 05:38.913
You wouldn't understand.

05:38.956 --> 05:40.695
You know, Tony,

05:40.739 --> 05:42.739
baseball is actually
very popular in Israel.

05:42.782 --> 05:45.043
Shh.
They even started
their own...

05:45.086 --> 05:47.217
Boss, you might want
to listen to this.

05:47.260 --> 05:49.826
Hey, floor.

05:49.869 --> 05:51.739
I think our shooter
may have been more

05:51.782 --> 05:53.043
than just an angry listener.

05:53.086 --> 05:54.217
Check it out.

05:54.260 --> 05:55.913
GATOR:
After the break,

05:55.956 --> 05:58.652
I want to address
a very disturbing threat

05:58.695 --> 06:02.086
that I received
from a group of my... [laughs]

06:02.130 --> 06:03.695
...a group of my fans.

06:03.739 --> 06:05.521
Whack-pots who don't know
the difference

06:05.565 --> 06:08.391
between patriotism
and terrorism.

06:08.434 --> 06:10.608
I will expose what might be

06:10.652 --> 06:13.869
thenext great threat
to national security,

06:13.913 --> 06:15.695
right after a word from...

06:15.739 --> 06:17.043
[gunshot]

06:17.086 --> 06:18.434
Hey, what are you doing?!

06:18.478 --> 06:19.913
Hey, put it down! Hey, hey, hey!

06:19.956 --> 06:21.826
Gator wasn't killed
for something he said.

06:23.782 --> 06:25.913
He was killed for something
he was about to say.

06:34.434 --> 06:36.826
I usually listen to the show
on my way to work,

06:36.869 --> 06:39.086
but...

06:39.130 --> 06:40.826
I hit traffic.

06:40.869 --> 06:44.086
First time I've ever been
thankful for a weak signal.

06:44.130 --> 06:45.434
TONY:
Mrs. Gator,

06:45.478 --> 06:46.913
your husband said
he received a threat

06:46.956 --> 06:48.347
from a group of listeners?

06:48.391 --> 06:51.478
Adam got angry calls
and idle threats all the time.

06:51.521 --> 06:54.304
A lot of redneck
crackpots out there.

06:54.347 --> 06:56.086
Except, um, well, these ones--

06:56.130 --> 06:58.695
they were actually
trying to recruit him.

06:58.739 --> 07:00.565
For what?
I don't know.

07:00.608 --> 07:03.304
Adam said they were
some kind of, like,

07:03.347 --> 07:06.260
half-assed extremist group
that claimed to have a bomb.

07:06.304 --> 07:08.913
I mean, I've never
seen him so excited.

07:08.956 --> 07:10.478
Excited?

07:10.521 --> 07:12.304
Yeah, he said it would make
for a good program.

07:12.347 --> 07:13.739
Listen.

07:15.869 --> 07:18.652
His on-air persona--
that was just for show.

07:18.695 --> 07:23.173
Adam was a decent man,
a patriot.

07:23.217 --> 07:24.608
And he would have called
the police

07:24.652 --> 07:26.260
if he thought
that they were serious.

07:26.304 --> 07:29.695
But I guess if they were just
willing to kill him...

07:29.739 --> 07:31.652
Do you know who theyare?

07:31.695 --> 07:33.869
[sighs]
Adam never said.

07:33.913 --> 07:36.173
Um... but he always kept

07:36.217 --> 07:38.086
every piece of mail,

07:38.130 --> 07:40.565
and he recorded
every phone conversation,

07:40.608 --> 07:43.782
both on and off the air,
just in case.

07:43.826 --> 07:47.173
Please find whoever did this?

07:47.217 --> 07:48.608
Please?

07:53.478 --> 07:55.739
[rhythmic clicking]

07:59.521 --> 08:01.000
[elevator bell dings]

08:01.043 --> 08:02.521
Nuts!

08:02.565 --> 08:04.304
I thought I had
it that time.

08:04.347 --> 08:06.608
Abby?
Hi, Gibbs. Come in.

08:06.652 --> 08:08.217
I'm just practicing
active sonar.

08:08.260 --> 08:09.739
Did you know that

08:09.782 --> 08:11.695
there's blind people who
can navigate themselves

08:11.739 --> 08:13.347
by making a... [clicking]

08:13.391 --> 08:15.782
...with their tongue, so they
can hear objects around them?

08:15.826 --> 08:17.347
[clicking]

08:17.391 --> 08:19.826
Did one of them
kill our victims?

08:19.869 --> 08:23.434
Um, no, but the principle
behind that is what's

08:23.478 --> 08:25.130
gonna help us catch who did.

08:25.173 --> 08:26.130
Welcome to the world

08:26.173 --> 08:28.260
of binaural audio.

08:28.304 --> 08:29.478
In the radio interview,

08:29.521 --> 08:31.608
the radio host and
the navy commander

08:31.652 --> 08:33.043
were using separate
microphones

08:33.086 --> 08:35.260
positioned
in opposite directions, so, when

08:35.304 --> 08:38.000
you listen with one channel in
one ear, and the other channel

08:38.043 --> 08:39.478
in the other ear,

08:39.521 --> 08:41.130
your brain recreates a
three-dimensional space.

08:41.173 --> 08:42.913
It's like listening
to "In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida."

08:42.956 --> 08:44.782
Yes. Wow.

08:44.826 --> 08:47.782
Only it's-it's gunshots
instead of a drum solo. Wow.

08:47.826 --> 08:49.391
Okay. Huh.

08:49.434 --> 08:52.478
Um, that's why we have ears
on opposite sides of our head.

08:52.521 --> 08:54.695
So I was able to listen
to the shooting

08:54.739 --> 08:56.304
as if I was in the room.

08:56.347 --> 08:57.913
[gunshot]

08:57.956 --> 08:59.521
So, using acoustics,

08:59.565 --> 09:01.304
I could isolate
minute characteristics

09:01.347 --> 09:02.782
in our murder weapon,

09:02.826 --> 09:05.043
and I compared them
with catalogued audio files.

09:05.086 --> 09:07.652
It's a Remington 7400,

09:07.695 --> 09:09.478
four-cartridge magazine,

09:09.521 --> 09:11.565
improved gas release,
smooth cycling.

09:11.608 --> 09:13.217
Hunting rifle.

09:13.260 --> 09:15.086
These the tapes
the wife gave us?

09:15.130 --> 09:16.869
ABBY:
Yeah. Tony just
brought them down.

09:16.913 --> 09:18.043
Great. Keep listening, Abbs.

09:18.086 --> 09:19.739
Gibbs? Gibbs? Gibbs?!

09:19.782 --> 09:21.000
[clicks]

09:22.130 --> 09:23.304
[clicking]

09:23.347 --> 09:26.173
Here's one.

09:26.217 --> 09:28.304
"I would listen
to your program more

09:28.347 --> 09:30.043
if you were on it less."

09:30.086 --> 09:31.652
This one's nice.

09:31.695 --> 09:34.000
It's a marriage proposal
from a woman who thinks

09:34.043 --> 09:36.086
that Gator would be just
as sharp-tongued in the bedroom.

09:36.130 --> 09:37.695
It's good.

09:37.739 --> 09:39.086
McGEE:
Yeah, I get the
sense these people

09:39.130 --> 09:40.608
have a little too much time
on their hands.

09:40.652 --> 09:42.304
None of these
are credible threats.

09:42.347 --> 09:43.434
Why would Gator keep them?

09:43.478 --> 09:44.695
TONY:
Guess you never know

09:44.739 --> 09:46.086
who's gonna get you--
the ones that love you,

09:46.130 --> 09:47.739
or the ones that hate you.

09:47.782 --> 09:49.217
"Together we can
make a difference.

09:49.260 --> 09:50.695
Matt L."

09:50.739 --> 09:52.000
Look at this.

09:52.043 --> 09:53.739
Ben Franklin's
old political cartoon.Oh.

09:53.782 --> 09:55.043
TONY:
Short.

09:55.086 --> 09:57.739
Sweet. Creepy.

09:57.782 --> 09:59.304
And no postage.

09:59.347 --> 10:01.869
Hmm. Someone didn't want
to be tracked down.

10:01.913 --> 10:04.043
And it's addressed
to the radio station's

10:04.086 --> 10:05.521
P.O. box.

10:05.565 --> 10:07.086
Only someone with
direct access

10:07.130 --> 10:09.130
to the postal service could
have delivered this letter.

10:09.173 --> 10:12.173
Sounds like I'm searching
the postal worker database

10:12.217 --> 10:15.130
for any Matt L.

10:15.173 --> 10:19.043
Unfortunately, Commander,
the broadcast media today

10:19.086 --> 10:22.043
is programmed
to assault our senses.

10:22.086 --> 10:24.869
You're too young,
but I remember as a child

10:24.913 --> 10:27.434
listening to my favorite
radio programs.

10:27.478 --> 10:29.260
Dick Barton, Special Agent.

10:29.304 --> 10:31.434
The Man in Black.

10:31.478 --> 10:34.347
Mystery, intrigue, suspense.

10:34.391 --> 10:35.826
Answers?

10:35.869 --> 10:37.913
That, too.

10:37.956 --> 10:40.043
No doubt something
the grieving families

10:40.086 --> 10:42.304
of these three men
eagerly anticipate.

10:42.347 --> 10:44.086
So do I, Duck.

10:44.130 --> 10:45.956
I confirmed
the cause of death

10:46.000 --> 10:49.130
as gunshot wounds
to all three victims.

10:49.173 --> 10:52.260
However, in the process
of collecting the rounds,

10:52.304 --> 10:55.043
I noticed a peculiar odor.

10:55.086 --> 10:56.391
You mean
other than gunpowder?

10:56.434 --> 10:58.695
I sent the bullets from
these two up to Abby,

10:58.739 --> 11:00.652
and according to
her test results,

11:00.695 --> 11:05.565
it's deer urine
and from an adult doe.

11:05.608 --> 11:07.652
Used by hunters
to attract bucks.

11:07.695 --> 11:09.304
Yes, it was probably on
the shooter's fingers

11:09.347 --> 11:11.043
when he last
loaded the weapon.

11:11.086 --> 11:12.478
Any specific brand?

11:12.521 --> 11:13.695
That's not a chemical
reproduction.

11:13.739 --> 11:15.608
What's on
that bullet

11:15.652 --> 11:18.434
was collected
at the source.

11:18.478 --> 11:20.000
Yeah, well,
the source of this, Duck,

11:20.043 --> 11:22.217
by now is probably hanging
on a wall over a beer tap.

11:22.260 --> 11:23.217
Who are we looking for?

11:23.260 --> 11:24.434
The radio station

11:24.478 --> 11:27.000
predominantly reaches
an agrarian area.

11:27.043 --> 11:29.347
I would hazard a guess that
you're looking for someone

11:29.391 --> 11:33.086
on the outskirts of society,
separated from the others.

11:33.130 --> 11:34.826
Except those
that agree with them.

11:34.869 --> 11:36.826
It's not uncommon for
the like-minded to unite.

11:36.869 --> 11:39.565
Perhaps they felt they
didn't have a voice,

11:39.608 --> 11:42.521
hence the need, as
the wife suggested,

11:42.565 --> 11:45.521
to recruit our
radio host.

11:45.565 --> 11:48.478
Matt L.

11:48.521 --> 11:50.826
You always deliver mail
with no postage?

11:50.869 --> 11:52.695
You do have access to
P.O. boxes, don't you?

11:52.739 --> 11:53.913
Your point?

11:53.956 --> 11:55.782
Well...

11:55.826 --> 11:59.000
we pretty much get
what you mean by "die,"

11:59.043 --> 12:00.565
but what I'm
curious about

12:00.608 --> 12:02.000
is the "join."

12:02.043 --> 12:03.826
You a member of some kind
of secret club?

12:03.869 --> 12:05.869
Just the local "Y."

12:05.913 --> 12:08.043
I saw Adam Gator last week

12:08.086 --> 12:10.173
and asked him if he'd do a few
free ads for a fund-raiser.

12:10.217 --> 12:13.434
Turned me down, so I was
just giving him a hard time.

12:13.478 --> 12:16.695
Sure, in a letter
with no postage.

12:16.739 --> 12:19.130
You here to talk to me
about 44 cents?

12:19.173 --> 12:20.826
Adam Gator is dead.

12:20.869 --> 12:23.478
When?

12:23.521 --> 12:24.826
You don't listen to his show?

12:24.869 --> 12:26.652
I've been on my route
all day.

12:26.695 --> 12:28.217
Do you have anything to
verify your whereabouts

12:28.260 --> 12:29.173
at 8:05 this morning?

12:29.217 --> 12:31.782
How about Uncle Sam?

12:33.913 --> 12:36.304
7:49 a.m.

12:36.347 --> 12:38.521
Priority delivery
in Groveton.

12:41.217 --> 12:43.695
That's a good 20 minutes
from the radio station.

12:43.739 --> 12:46.478
I know.

12:50.869 --> 12:53.043
Gibbs,

12:53.086 --> 12:54.913
ah, are you trying to give
me heart palpitations?

12:54.956 --> 12:56.217
No.

12:56.260 --> 12:57.521
What do you got, Abbs?

12:57.565 --> 13:01.565
Heart palpitations
and a headache

13:01.608 --> 13:02.608
from listening to
all these tapes

13:02.652 --> 13:03.826
that Gator's
wife sent us.

13:03.869 --> 13:05.173
I mean, the guy
recorded everything--

13:05.217 --> 13:06.695
calls to the
radio station,

13:06.739 --> 13:08.695
his cell phone,
his home phone.

13:08.739 --> 13:10.000
These the "best of"?

13:10.043 --> 13:12.608
No, I got something more
like a one-hit wonder.

13:12.652 --> 13:14.173
It's a call that came in
to Gator's cell phone

13:14.217 --> 13:15.434
the night
before he was killed.

13:15.478 --> 13:16.260
Okay, let me hear it.

13:16.304 --> 13:18.478
[typing]

13:18.521 --> 13:20.304
MAN:
Have you given any thought
to our offer?

13:20.347 --> 13:23.565
GATOR:
I don't want anything to do
with you, your group,

13:23.608 --> 13:25.434
or its grand plan.

13:25.478 --> 13:26.478
MAN:
You should reconsider.

13:26.521 --> 13:28.478
M.A.H. could use
someone like you.

13:28.521 --> 13:30.217
GATOR:
If it's airtime you want,
you're going to get it.

13:30.260 --> 13:32.043
Tune in tomorrow.

13:32.086 --> 13:35.347
I'm gonna expose you and M.A.H.
for what you really are--

13:35.391 --> 13:37.695
domestic terrorists.

13:37.739 --> 13:38.782
M.A.H.?

13:38.826 --> 13:40.826
I checked the
GTD databases,

13:40.869 --> 13:42.913
the terror-watch
databases, even Google.

13:42.956 --> 13:44.695
Haven't found any group
by that name.

13:44.739 --> 13:45.913
Well, whoever it was,
they were willing to kill

13:45.956 --> 13:46.913
to keep it that way.

13:46.956 --> 13:48.000
Did you track the call?

13:48.043 --> 13:49.913
I checked Gator's
phone records.

13:49.956 --> 13:52.000
The call came from
a blocked landline.

13:52.043 --> 13:54.173
I am tracing
the call-routing now.

13:55.913 --> 13:58.217
I wastracing
the call-routing now.

13:58.260 --> 13:59.043
The line quality failed.

13:59.086 --> 14:00.173
Must be old wiring.

14:00.217 --> 14:02.434
Maybe a rural area?

14:02.478 --> 14:04.608
[typing]

14:06.652 --> 14:10.739
No, actually,
used to be a rural area.

14:10.782 --> 14:11.782
I don't think
we're looking

14:11.826 --> 14:13.043
for a hillbilly
militia, Gibbs.

14:13.086 --> 14:14.956
Our mystery voice wasn't calling

14:15.000 --> 14:16.391
from the backwoods.

14:16.434 --> 14:18.869
He was calling
from Royal Woods,

14:18.913 --> 14:21.043
one of the wealthiest
gated communities

14:21.086 --> 14:23.782
in suburban D.C.

14:23.826 --> 14:25.782
There goes
the neighborhood.

14:31.869 --> 14:33.173
ZIVA:
Royal Woods is a nice place.

14:33.217 --> 14:34.695
I should live there.

14:34.739 --> 14:36.086
McGEE:
It's quiet,
it's private, secure.

14:36.130 --> 14:38.913
It's got everything but
the white picket fence.

14:38.956 --> 14:41.000
A picket fence would
provide neither security

14:41.043 --> 14:43.173
nor privacy.

14:43.217 --> 14:45.217
I was speaking
more-- a metaphor...
TONY:
Yeah? Beautiful.

14:45.260 --> 14:46.478
American dream.

14:46.521 --> 14:47.652
Huh.
All right.

14:47.695 --> 14:50.000
According to the FBI
and Homeland Security,

14:50.043 --> 14:51.695
that dream is still
alive and well

14:51.739 --> 14:54.217
at Royal Woods
Luxury Living.

14:54.260 --> 14:56.608
Nothing on our domestic
terrorist group there?

14:56.652 --> 14:59.260
Nope, and the only records
they have on the initials M.A.H.

14:59.304 --> 15:00.608
are a political slogan.

15:00.652 --> 15:02.434
that stands for
"Military at Home,"

15:02.478 --> 15:05.043
the belief that we should
protect the homeland first.

15:05.086 --> 15:07.086
Rather than acting as
the world's police.

15:07.130 --> 15:09.521
I find it hard to believe
that someone would be willing

15:09.565 --> 15:12.260
to risk this slice of cherry pie
to become criminals.

15:12.304 --> 15:13.565
Eh, I don't know.

15:13.608 --> 15:14.956
Arlington Road
with Tim Robbins.

15:15.000 --> 15:17.739
So-called Harvard militias
are like urban legend.

15:17.782 --> 15:19.956
Urban legend did not murder
three people.

15:20.000 --> 15:21.956
Urban Legendwas a movie
with Rebecca Gayheart.

15:22.000 --> 15:23.304
[growls]

15:24.608 --> 15:26.304
Never mind.
Royal Woods-- go.

15:27.739 --> 15:29.826
"Just outside Alexandria,

15:29.869 --> 15:33.478
an exclusive gated community
of 35 beautiful homes."

15:33.521 --> 15:35.739
Background checks
on the residents came up empty.

15:35.782 --> 15:38.391
They appear to be
model citizens.

15:38.434 --> 15:40.043
Appearances can
be deceiving.

15:40.086 --> 15:42.391
If we can get voice samples
from each man who lives there,

15:42.434 --> 15:44.260
then Abby can match them
against our mystery caller.

15:44.304 --> 15:45.826
How are we going
to get that

15:45.869 --> 15:48.130
without tipping off
our underground cell?

15:48.173 --> 15:49.869
No, not sell, DiNozzo.

15:51.043 --> 15:52.869
Buy.

15:55.695 --> 15:56.652
TONY:
Start recording, McGee.

15:56.695 --> 15:59.173
Neighbor number one, here we go.

15:59.217 --> 16:00.869
[clears throat]

16:05.086 --> 16:06.434
Hi.

16:06.478 --> 16:08.782
How did a salesman
get past the guard?

16:08.826 --> 16:10.391
I'm not a salesman.

16:10.434 --> 16:12.478
I'm actually looking at buying
the home down the street

16:12.521 --> 16:14.043
and I was wondering
if there was anything

16:14.086 --> 16:15.434
you could tell me
about the previous owners.

16:15.478 --> 16:17.565
My name's Tony,
by the way.

16:17.608 --> 16:18.652
Italian.

16:18.695 --> 16:21.173
Well, I think the
previous owners

16:21.217 --> 16:23.130
had some structural problems.

16:23.173 --> 16:25.043
Sorry.

16:26.869 --> 16:29.260
The neighbors are friendly,
the streets are quiet,

16:29.304 --> 16:32.260
and the H.O.A. dues
are super reasonable.

16:32.304 --> 16:34.782
Good drainage and the
schools are great.

16:34.826 --> 16:36.826
Yeah.

16:36.869 --> 16:39.260
You did say that your husband
was at home, right?

16:40.434 --> 16:42.521
Uh, you know, um,

16:42.565 --> 16:45.478
do you want to
talk out back?

16:45.521 --> 16:47.391
I've got the Jacuzzi
all warmed up.

16:48.565 --> 16:50.695
I'm married.

16:50.739 --> 16:53.086
Really?

16:53.130 --> 16:54.260
Where's the ring?

16:54.304 --> 16:56.913
Uh...

16:59.304 --> 17:01.826
Practice is at 4:00 and don't
forget you got to pick me up.

17:01.869 --> 17:02.826
I can't make it.

17:02.869 --> 17:04.608
Can you get a ride?

17:04.652 --> 17:06.304
Wouldn't need one
if I had a car.

17:06.347 --> 17:08.043
[growls in frustration]

17:08.086 --> 17:10.217
Fine.

17:10.260 --> 17:11.652
I'll talk to one of my friends.

17:11.695 --> 17:13.043
Maybe one of theirdads
will be there.

17:13.086 --> 17:15.086
Hello. Hey.

17:15.130 --> 17:16.086
Can I help you?

17:16.130 --> 17:17.652
I'm kind of in a hurry here.

17:17.695 --> 17:19.217
Yeah, sorry to bother you.
You know, I'm just looking

17:19.260 --> 17:21.043
at houses in the neighborhood
and I really love it here.

17:21.086 --> 17:22.608
It's, uh, it's just I'm worried
about the commute.

17:22.652 --> 17:23.695
I work in D.C.

17:23.739 --> 17:25.086
You get to know
the traffic patterns.

17:25.130 --> 17:26.086
Do you mind?

17:26.130 --> 17:27.565
Sorry.
Thanks.

17:29.347 --> 17:31.173
Oh, hey, excuse me.

17:32.652 --> 17:34.347
Excuse me,
jogger people.

17:34.391 --> 17:36.304
Joggers.

17:36.347 --> 17:37.782
Hello!

17:40.739 --> 17:42.565
[panting]

17:42.608 --> 17:43.782
What happened
to you?

17:43.826 --> 17:45.217
[panting]

17:45.260 --> 17:46.956
Don't play dumb.

17:47.000 --> 17:49.782
You reveled in every minute
of my suburban suffering.

17:49.826 --> 17:52.347
Actually, no, we've
been not listening

17:52.391 --> 17:53.608
for the last
couple hours.

17:53.652 --> 17:56.000
One can only stand
your voice for so long.

17:56.043 --> 17:57.782
Did you talk to everyone?

17:57.826 --> 18:02.391
All 43 residents, including the
entire cast of American Beauty--

18:02.434 --> 18:06.043
in a nice bikini--
and The Stepford Wives.

18:06.086 --> 18:07.304
Have we got anything to drink?

18:07.347 --> 18:08.347
I got a little tickle
in my throat.

18:08.391 --> 18:10.391
[coughs]

18:10.434 --> 18:12.913
Just let the cherry ethyl
propionate coat your throat.

18:12.956 --> 18:13.913
You'll be okay.

18:13.956 --> 18:15.521
[grunts]

18:15.565 --> 18:17.652
Wow.

18:17.695 --> 18:19.565
I forgot how strong
this stuff is.

18:20.739 --> 18:21.956
Any hits yet?

18:22.000 --> 18:23.173
No,

18:23.217 --> 18:25.608
but listening
to your conversations

18:25.652 --> 18:27.391
with the Royal Woods
residents

18:27.434 --> 18:28.869
was so much more entertaining

18:28.913 --> 18:31.956
than listening to
Adam Gator's phone calls.

18:32.000 --> 18:34.043
Well, thank you very much,
I'm putting out a CD.[chuckles]

18:34.086 --> 18:35.565
[computer bleeping]

18:35.608 --> 18:38.130
Voiceprint
for Gator's caller matches

18:38.173 --> 18:40.391
lucky interviewee number 11.

18:40.434 --> 18:44.304
Number 11--
26724 Royal Woods Circle.

18:45.478 --> 18:47.391
Okay,

18:47.434 --> 18:49.869
house belongs to Arthur Haskell.

18:49.913 --> 18:52.826
He seemed more Ward Cleaver
than Bin Laden.

18:52.869 --> 18:56.608
Arthur Haskell-- he's a
successful investment banker

18:56.652 --> 18:58.304
out of Alexandria.

18:59.478 --> 19:02.217
Moved to Royal Woods
a year ago.

19:04.391 --> 19:06.391
No criminal record
and there's

19:06.434 --> 19:09.826
nothing to suggest any kind of
history of political activism,

19:09.869 --> 19:11.043
violent or otherwise.

19:11.086 --> 19:13.782
Any connection
with Adam Gator or M.A.H.?

19:13.826 --> 19:16.478
I'm sending his name
and his info to McGee.

19:16.521 --> 19:18.608
Oh.

19:18.652 --> 19:21.608
Arthur Haskell's wife was killed

19:21.652 --> 19:23.347
18 months ago
in a home invasion--

19:23.391 --> 19:26.173
drug addict with a gun.

19:26.217 --> 19:29.913
Haskell and his 16-year-old
daughter witnessed the murder.

19:29.956 --> 19:32.652
Reason enough to want
military protection at home.

19:34.695 --> 19:36.391
McGEE:
Boss, I found
a series of messages

19:36.434 --> 19:38.043
in Haskell's e-mail history

19:38.086 --> 19:40.391
discussing an anniversary gift
for his wife.

19:40.434 --> 19:42.869
McGee, his wife has been dead
for over a year.

19:42.913 --> 19:44.869
Makes a custom wristwatch
kind of an odd choice.

19:44.913 --> 19:46.173
Obviously it was a code.

19:46.217 --> 19:48.217
How do you know this?

19:49.956 --> 19:51.913
Haskell met

19:51.956 --> 19:53.782
last week with a
Deeter Johanson.

19:53.826 --> 19:55.217
He is not a watchmaker.

19:55.260 --> 19:57.826
Mr. Johanson is a chef.

19:57.869 --> 19:59.043
Former meth cooker

19:59.086 --> 20:01.521
from South Africa

20:01.565 --> 20:03.652
who, according to Homeland
Security's wanted list,

20:03.695 --> 20:06.043
now bakes specialized explosives

20:06.086 --> 20:07.652
and sells them
on the black market.

20:07.695 --> 20:09.521
According to
Haskell's calendar,

20:09.565 --> 20:11.869
the two of them are supposed
to meet again this afternoon.

20:11.913 --> 20:14.826
Haskell and M.A.H.
are not buying a wristwatch.

20:14.869 --> 20:18.043
No, they're buying a bomb,

20:18.086 --> 20:20.043
and Deeter's not going
to that meeting-- we are.

20:20.086 --> 20:22.913
Boss, we only have two hours
until the meeting.

20:22.956 --> 20:25.086
That's not enough time
to build a full cover alias.

20:25.130 --> 20:26.347
It's okay.

20:27.652 --> 20:29.913
We're not going to need one.

20:45.391 --> 20:47.260
Deeter is late.

20:49.043 --> 20:51.217
McGee.

20:51.260 --> 20:52.782
We're all set here, boss.

20:52.826 --> 20:54.782
One final keystroke
and the last five years

20:54.826 --> 20:56.956
will be completely erased.

21:02.391 --> 21:04.347
There he is.

21:04.391 --> 21:06.347
DiNozzo.

21:06.391 --> 21:07.826
Go.

21:07.869 --> 21:09.086
Boss?

21:09.130 --> 21:10.173
Do it, McGee.

21:14.217 --> 21:15.565
Okay, slate's clean.

21:18.130 --> 21:20.130
Whoa-ho-ho, excuse me.

21:20.173 --> 21:21.521
Can't park there--

21:21.565 --> 21:23.043
15-minute loading and
unloading zone only.

21:23.086 --> 21:24.304
I'll take my chances,
thanks.

21:24.347 --> 21:25.521
You're a risk taker.

21:25.565 --> 21:26.565
Hi, Deeter. NCIS.

21:31.782 --> 21:33.956
I don't have anything on me.

21:34.000 --> 21:36.130
We'll see about that.

21:36.173 --> 21:37.391
This turns blue,

21:37.434 --> 21:39.826
then you, Deeter,
have been handling

21:39.869 --> 21:43.565
some very bad things.

21:43.608 --> 21:44.565
All right.

21:44.608 --> 21:46.565
Drumroll.

21:46.608 --> 21:48.608
Ah-ho-ho!

21:48.652 --> 21:51.391
Congratulations,
I think you're pregnant.

21:51.434 --> 21:52.739
Awesome.

21:52.782 --> 21:53.565
Hands behind your back.

21:55.782 --> 21:56.739
[handcuffs clicking]

22:02.260 --> 22:04.652
Can I help you?

22:04.695 --> 22:06.478
No, but I can help you.

22:06.521 --> 22:07.608
And your group.

22:09.695 --> 22:12.652
If you don't mind, I'm actually,
uh, waiting for someone.

22:14.956 --> 22:18.826
I'm afraid Deeter Johanson
is out of business.

22:18.869 --> 22:22.565
In his line of work,
competition can be a killer.

22:25.478 --> 22:27.652
[quietly]:
Who are you?

22:27.695 --> 22:29.826
I'm Ziva David.

22:29.869 --> 22:32.347
The competition.

22:41.782 --> 22:42.913
[coughing]

22:42.956 --> 22:45.782
[clearing throat]

22:45.826 --> 22:47.260
[coughing]

22:47.304 --> 22:48.869
[clears throat]

22:48.913 --> 22:50.347
Your throat sounds like
it's getting worse.

22:51.782 --> 22:54.521
How's Miss America doing?

22:54.565 --> 22:56.521
Who's she supposed
to be again, anyway?

22:56.565 --> 22:58.000
She's playing herself, Tony,

22:58.043 --> 23:00.652
from five years ago,
before she started at NCIS.

23:00.695 --> 23:03.434
Sassy rogue Mossad agent.

23:03.478 --> 23:05.608
Sometimes I miss
that little minx.

23:05.652 --> 23:07.695
Well, it's only temporary
till we find out

23:07.739 --> 23:09.521
what our suburban
terrorists are planning.

23:10.956 --> 23:13.521
She's not doing
a very good job.

23:13.565 --> 23:15.260
TONY:
The body language
is all wrong.

23:15.304 --> 23:16.739
Classic Ziva
would've been

23:16.782 --> 23:20.260
more reckless,
hair would've been more wild.

23:20.304 --> 23:23.478
She was very sexual then.

23:23.521 --> 23:25.913
You think Ziva's
less sexual now?

23:25.956 --> 23:28.086
Compared to the Ziva I shared
a bed with five years ago,

23:28.130 --> 23:29.347
yeah.

23:29.391 --> 23:32.000
[exhales]
You guys were undercover.

23:32.043 --> 23:34.869
I mean, you were just
putting on a show.

23:39.086 --> 23:40.869
You were putting
on a show, right?

23:40.913 --> 23:44.434
[clearing throat]

23:44.478 --> 23:46.826
ZIVA:
Deeter's line of work
made him an enemy to Israel.

23:46.869 --> 23:49.000
Getting rid of him
was for country.

23:49.043 --> 23:51.434
Doing business with you,
now, that's for money,

23:51.478 --> 23:54.652
I believe I have
something that you need.

23:56.260 --> 23:59.130
A Mossad profiteer working
on American soil.

23:59.173 --> 24:02.043
Well, where exactly do
your allegiances lie?

24:02.086 --> 24:03.086
That does not matter.

24:03.130 --> 24:05.043
It is not my job
to police America.

24:05.086 --> 24:07.217
I have other customers.

24:07.260 --> 24:09.826
Deeter had a thriving business.

24:09.869 --> 24:11.217
Good luck.

24:11.260 --> 24:15.043
Wait-wait-wait-wait-wait.

24:15.086 --> 24:18.608
If I did need to get in touch
with you, how would I do that?

24:18.652 --> 24:20.695
Do not bother
unless you're serious.

24:24.217 --> 24:26.304
I assume you know where I live.

24:26.347 --> 24:28.608
Why don't you stop by later,
and we'll talk.

24:28.652 --> 24:30.565
Why don't we talk now?

24:30.608 --> 24:34.652
[chuckles]
I have a few phone calls
to make, Miss David.

24:37.652 --> 24:38.608
[coughing]

24:38.652 --> 24:40.260
[sniffing]

24:40.304 --> 24:41.521
[clearing throat]

24:47.565 --> 24:49.043
[coughs]

24:49.086 --> 24:50.956
That cough gets worse,

24:51.000 --> 24:53.695
you might want
to have it looked at.

24:53.739 --> 24:55.652
You spend a lot of time
around fresh-cut grass?

24:58.217 --> 25:01.086
I just did. Why?

25:01.130 --> 25:03.000
I know something
about fertilizer.

25:04.739 --> 25:07.130
It can permanently
atrophy your vocal cords.

25:07.173 --> 25:10.478
[hoarsely]:
So you admit to...
mixing explosives?

25:10.521 --> 25:12.608
What's our little nest

25:12.652 --> 25:15.782
of yuppie terrorists
up to, huh?

25:15.826 --> 25:17.478
Besides renovating
their game rooms.

25:20.478 --> 25:22.869
I said I wanted a deal.

25:22.913 --> 25:25.043
[squeaky]:
You want to spend the rest
of your life in prison?!

25:25.086 --> 25:26.478
Fine by me!

25:26.521 --> 25:27.956
[very squeaky]:
Start talking!

25:28.000 --> 25:29.478
I'm sorry, I...
I can barely understand.

25:29.521 --> 25:30.956
You're gonna have to speak up.

25:31.000 --> 25:33.652
[very squeaky]:
Start talking!
What?

25:33.695 --> 25:35.434
Sta...

25:37.086 --> 25:38.347
Help.

25:38.391 --> 25:39.565
[clears throat]
Boss.

25:41.000 --> 25:42.782
[sighs, squeaks]

25:48.043 --> 25:49.695
We don't negotiate
with terrorists.

25:51.086 --> 25:53.391
Unless I cooperate.

25:53.434 --> 25:55.739
Homeland Security's gonna
make you their new poster boy.

25:55.782 --> 25:59.652
And you will
cooperate, because...

25:59.695 --> 26:01.173
you'll be trying to
save your own ass.

26:01.217 --> 26:03.391
That's not
negotiating.

26:03.434 --> 26:05.739
Okay, Haskell hired me

26:05.782 --> 26:07.608
to make him a batch
of explosives.

26:07.652 --> 26:11.130
They had to be undetectable
to scanners and dogs.

26:11.173 --> 26:12.260
What's the target?

26:12.304 --> 26:14.217
I-I don't know.

26:14.260 --> 26:15.739
Where's the bomb?

26:15.782 --> 26:17.739
Haskell's got it.

26:17.782 --> 26:19.130
[squeaky]:
Then why the meeting
this afternoon?

26:19.173 --> 26:20.130
Because my explosives

26:20.173 --> 26:21.913
don't detonate
below 400 degrees,

26:21.956 --> 26:23.521
Celsius.

26:23.565 --> 26:27.217
That much concentrated
heat, it requires...

26:27.260 --> 26:29.304
a unique combustion trigger.

26:29.347 --> 26:30.565
We were meeting about

26:30.608 --> 26:31.869
a price on a detonator.

26:31.913 --> 26:34.130
I'd already sold
Haskell the explosives.

26:34.173 --> 26:36.391
Well, he's gonna need a trigger.

26:36.434 --> 26:39.304
I'm gonna need a deal.

26:41.260 --> 26:43.478
Ah... ah...

26:47.086 --> 26:49.478
[hoarsely]:
Gearing up for your trek
into the American dream?

26:49.521 --> 26:51.173
DUCKY:
Anthony, this would be

26:51.217 --> 26:53.608
so much easier if you
would just keep still.

26:53.652 --> 26:55.086
I didn't know you
stopped using those.

26:55.130 --> 26:56.086
Ever since I became

26:56.130 --> 26:59.217
an official probationary agent.

26:59.260 --> 27:01.043
Does that feel good?

27:01.086 --> 27:03.913
Heavier than I remember.

27:03.956 --> 27:05.173
You'll get used to it.

27:05.217 --> 27:08.043
I'd hate for you to
completely relapse.

27:08.086 --> 27:09.565
You did not like me then?

27:09.608 --> 27:11.043
[squeaky yelp]

27:11.086 --> 27:12.478
My apologies,
Anthony,

27:12.521 --> 27:14.000
but I don't see
anything serious.

27:14.043 --> 27:15.478
Merely some inflammation

27:15.521 --> 27:16.782
from overuse.

27:16.826 --> 27:18.130
Nothing to be
concerned about.

27:18.173 --> 27:19.347
However,

27:19.391 --> 27:21.826
to prevent further
damage, I suggest

27:21.869 --> 27:24.956
that you refrain from talking
for the next 24 hours.

27:25.000 --> 27:26.043
[laughing]

27:27.304 --> 27:29.608
I understand it
won't be easy.

27:29.652 --> 27:32.652
But we certainly look forward
to seeing you try.

27:32.695 --> 27:35.000
Yeah, well, let's hope
there are no movie references

27:35.043 --> 27:37.043
that require
your edification.

27:37.086 --> 27:39.565
I'd hate for your ego

27:39.608 --> 27:41.043
to write a check

27:41.086 --> 27:42.652
your body can't cash.

27:42.695 --> 27:43.956
[gasps]

27:44.000 --> 27:45.347
Oh, I know that one.

27:45.391 --> 27:47.391
That's, um...

27:47.434 --> 27:49.043
Gone With the Wind,
right?

27:49.086 --> 27:50.304
Don't do it, DiNozzo.

27:50.347 --> 27:52.043
GIBBS:
Willpower.

27:52.086 --> 27:53.956
Ziva.

27:54.000 --> 27:55.217
Ready, Gibbs.

27:55.260 --> 27:57.043
[squeaky]:
Top Gun.

27:57.086 --> 27:58.086
Shh.

28:04.782 --> 28:07.347
So... you armed?

28:07.391 --> 28:09.000
Of course.

28:09.043 --> 28:11.173
I hear you have

28:11.217 --> 28:12.913
quite the famous father.

28:12.956 --> 28:16.652
I see you did your checkup
on me-- did I pass?

28:16.695 --> 28:17.913
Great.

28:17.956 --> 28:19.391
Let's get down to business.

28:29.391 --> 28:32.000
Deeter was gonna charge us
150 for the detonator.

28:32.043 --> 28:34.652
Then he was selling you junk.

28:34.695 --> 28:37.043
If you want a bomb
that size to go off,

28:37.086 --> 28:38.826
it's 300... thousand.

28:38.869 --> 28:40.043
Up front.

28:40.086 --> 28:42.043
What's the target?

28:48.913 --> 28:51.043
How do you want the money?

28:51.086 --> 28:53.695
You can wire it to this account.

28:54.826 --> 28:57.217
Do we have a deal?

29:02.652 --> 29:05.434
Why don't we join the party.

29:08.260 --> 29:09.782
Wow.

29:09.826 --> 29:12.043
HASKELL:
Make yourself at home.
Try the sangria.

29:12.086 --> 29:13.086
It's my secret recipe.

29:13.130 --> 29:14.956
[chuckles]

29:15.000 --> 29:17.956
I'll be right back.Mm-hmm.

29:18.000 --> 29:19.782
Daddy?

29:19.826 --> 29:21.565
Where were you?Oh,

29:21.608 --> 29:23.782
Kristin, honey, I am so
sorry I missed your game.

29:23.826 --> 29:24.869
I scored two goals!

29:24.913 --> 29:26.217
What the hell!

29:26.260 --> 29:28.347
I'm afraid that was my fault.

29:28.391 --> 29:30.869
I was late for a meeting
this afternoon.

29:30.913 --> 29:32.043
Who are you?

29:32.086 --> 29:35.043
Uh, a business
associate.

29:35.086 --> 29:37.260
Excuse us.

29:37.304 --> 29:39.782
I am really sorry, Kristin.

29:39.826 --> 29:41.478
KRISTIN:
Dad, you missed my game again.

29:41.521 --> 29:43.217
HASKELL:
I know, I know.

29:45.782 --> 29:47.782
Matt Lane,
barbecue king.

29:47.826 --> 29:48.782
Hi.

29:48.826 --> 29:50.043
Welcome.

29:50.086 --> 29:51.652
You just have to
try his sauce.

29:51.695 --> 29:53.391
He may be
our mailman,

29:53.434 --> 29:56.000
but he was born
to grill! [laughs]

29:56.043 --> 29:57.782
You must be Ziva.

29:57.826 --> 29:59.304
Mm-hmm.
I'm Annie Nelson.

29:59.347 --> 30:01.913
And this is my
husband, Zach.

30:03.217 --> 30:05.782
So... tell us
about yourself,

30:05.826 --> 30:07.043
Ziva.

30:07.086 --> 30:09.695
How long have you been
part of the cause?

30:11.869 --> 30:14.739
Well, uh, I'm not
officially a part...

30:14.782 --> 30:16.478
yet.

30:16.521 --> 30:19.217
Perhaps, uh,
you can enlighten me.

30:19.260 --> 30:21.956
In a way,
you're fortunate.

30:22.000 --> 30:24.260
When Israel spends money
on its military,

30:24.304 --> 30:26.695
it's usually to protect itself.

30:26.739 --> 30:29.391
We send our money
halfway around the world.

30:29.434 --> 30:31.304
You're not fighting a war
on your own soil.

30:31.347 --> 30:33.043
Oh, but we are.

30:33.086 --> 30:35.260
Crime, drugs,

30:35.304 --> 30:37.000
illiteracy-- fixing
these would be

30:37.043 --> 30:39.478
a much better use
of our resources.

30:39.521 --> 30:41.608
Except the only threat
our government takes seriously

30:41.652 --> 30:43.086
are the violent ones.

30:43.130 --> 30:44.478
So in order to bring

30:44.521 --> 30:46.217
that money and focus back home,

30:46.260 --> 30:49.043
some of us here have decided
to become a threat ourselves.

30:49.086 --> 30:50.956
Only some of you?

30:51.000 --> 30:53.608
Well, the ones willing
to risk the most.

30:55.695 --> 30:57.782
They would not tell me
the target, Gibbs.We don't need it.

30:57.826 --> 30:59.391
We know where
he keeps his bombs.

30:59.434 --> 31:01.478
Haskell needs our detonator--
I think I may have sold him

31:01.521 --> 31:04.478
on letting me be
there to set it off.No, no. Not gonna happen, Ziva.

31:04.521 --> 31:06.130
Make the call--
it's not gonna get that far.

31:06.173 --> 31:09.695
Boss, I just got a hit
on the dummy account
Ziva gave Haskell.

31:09.739 --> 31:11.565
Transferred the funds from
a bank in the Middle East.

31:11.608 --> 31:14.695
He's using his corporate
access to illegally
drain dormant accounts.

31:14.739 --> 31:16.304
Investment 101.

31:16.347 --> 31:18.608
Always use
somebody else's money.

31:18.652 --> 31:20.130
[hitting keys]

31:20.173 --> 31:23.652
McGEE:
But... this money's
already been red-flagged

31:23.695 --> 31:25.173
by Homeland Security.

31:25.217 --> 31:26.739
It belongs to real terrorists?

31:26.782 --> 31:28.217
Arthur Haskell
and his band

31:28.260 --> 31:31.217
of suburban patriots are
stealing money from al Qaeda.

31:31.260 --> 31:32.695
The bomb disposal
unit is ready.

31:32.739 --> 31:34.739
They'll meet us
at Haskell's house.Good.

31:34.782 --> 31:36.565
Let's go.

31:36.608 --> 31:38.304
ZIVA:
Federal agents!

31:38.347 --> 31:39.565
Federal agents!

31:40.826 --> 31:41.739
Gibbs! Back here!

31:48.608 --> 31:50.130
[hoarsely]:
He's still breathing.

31:52.695 --> 31:54.173
Gibbs.

31:55.565 --> 31:57.000
The bomb is missing.

31:57.043 --> 31:58.391
[door opens, closes]

31:58.434 --> 32:01.000
KRISTIN:
Daddy, I'm home!

32:01.043 --> 32:03.130
Daddy? Daddy!

32:03.173 --> 32:04.391
Federal agents. Stop.

32:04.434 --> 32:05.260
[sniffling]
Oh, my God.

32:05.304 --> 32:07.130
[crying]:
What happened?

32:07.173 --> 32:09.521
Daddy? Daddy!

32:15.391 --> 32:17.217
WOMAN:
Until someone in your extended
family can be here...

32:17.260 --> 32:19.173
[whispering]:
Hey, what's the
status on Haskell?

32:19.217 --> 32:20.869
He just regained consciousness

32:20.913 --> 32:23.478
and is being treated
for a mildconcussion.

32:23.521 --> 32:27.521
The doctor plans on
releasing him to us very soon.

32:27.565 --> 32:30.130
The daughter--
she refuses to see him.

32:30.173 --> 32:31.347
Child services?

32:31.391 --> 32:32.782
Yeah.

32:32.826 --> 32:35.434
We need to find out who
took the explosives.

32:37.086 --> 32:39.000
Gibbs, she has nothing
to do with this.

32:39.043 --> 32:41.000
Ziva, you go
talk to her.

32:41.043 --> 32:44.130
She knows more than
she thinks she does.

32:46.347 --> 32:48.217
Go.

32:49.695 --> 32:51.347
Okay.

33:00.869 --> 33:02.000
I know my dad's in trouble.

33:02.043 --> 33:03.608
Yes, he is.

33:03.652 --> 33:06.304
But he didn't shoot those people
at the radio station.

33:06.347 --> 33:08.130
It is only natural
to want to protect him.

33:08.173 --> 33:09.565
If he was stupid enough
to get involved

33:09.608 --> 33:11.347
with terrorists,
he can rot in jail.

33:11.391 --> 33:14.000
But I don't want it to be
for something he didn't do.

33:15.565 --> 33:18.608
It was the one morning
he took me to soccer practice.

33:18.652 --> 33:21.000
He went to work late
so he could stay and watch.

33:21.043 --> 33:23.652
So he was with you
the entire time?

33:23.695 --> 33:25.608
Yes.

33:25.652 --> 33:27.304
He couldn't
have done it.

33:29.000 --> 33:30.086
[sniffles]

33:30.130 --> 33:32.304
First Mom and now...

33:34.391 --> 33:36.260
Um...

33:36.304 --> 33:37.652
Look. Kristin?

33:37.695 --> 33:40.000
Fathers...

33:40.043 --> 33:43.000
they make, uh, mistakes.

33:43.043 --> 33:45.869
Mistakes that sometimes

33:45.913 --> 33:48.565
require a lot of forgiving.

33:48.608 --> 33:50.565
[sniffles]

33:50.608 --> 33:53.217
We need to find out

33:53.260 --> 33:54.521
who shot these people
and who did this

33:54.565 --> 33:55.739
to your father.

33:55.782 --> 33:57.652
I wish I could help.

34:00.217 --> 34:02.695
Well, did you...

34:02.739 --> 34:04.086
overhear anything

34:04.130 --> 34:06.173
or was your father
close to anyone?

34:06.217 --> 34:09.086
For a long time, nobody.

34:09.130 --> 34:10.739
After Mom was killed,

34:10.782 --> 34:12.913
he kind of shut
himself off.

34:12.956 --> 34:14.130
Then we moved.

34:14.173 --> 34:15.652
To Royal Woods, I know.

34:15.695 --> 34:17.173
New place.

34:17.217 --> 34:18.739
New friends.

34:18.782 --> 34:21.000
Dad even took a trip last winter
with one of the neighbors.

34:22.695 --> 34:25.043
Hold on. What
kind of trip?

34:25.086 --> 34:27.173
A hunting trip.

34:27.217 --> 34:29.217
Apparently, Mr. Nelson's
really into it.

34:31.391 --> 34:33.304
Zach Nelson?

34:35.391 --> 34:37.391
[chortles]
I think there's been a mistake.

34:37.434 --> 34:38.478
[chuckles]

34:38.521 --> 34:41.000
[door opens]

34:48.000 --> 34:49.130
What's this?

34:49.173 --> 34:51.043
Funny. A sportsman like you

34:51.086 --> 34:52.782
should recognize his own rifle.

34:52.826 --> 34:55.782
You searched my house?

34:55.826 --> 34:57.521
I have a right
to protect myself.

34:57.565 --> 34:59.391
McGEE:
Gated community wasn't
enough protection?

35:01.652 --> 35:04.130
That's typical.
Government officials

35:04.173 --> 35:06.434
telling me
how I should live.

35:06.478 --> 35:08.739
This is how you spend
my tax dollars?

35:08.782 --> 35:10.695
No.

35:10.739 --> 35:12.913
This is.

35:12.956 --> 35:14.956
Bullets from your gun

35:15.000 --> 35:16.782
match the ones
found in the victims.

35:16.826 --> 35:18.000
And your supply
of deer urine

35:18.043 --> 35:20.391
matches the residue
found on the slugs.

35:20.434 --> 35:22.347
[hoarsely]:
Yours, yours, yours, yours,
yours, yours.

35:22.391 --> 35:24.565
Your police resources
are stretched so thin.

35:24.608 --> 35:27.608
All you can do
is try and solve crimes

35:27.652 --> 35:29.043
after they've happened.

35:29.086 --> 35:31.000
Is that the line
you gave Haskell?

35:31.043 --> 35:34.173
What if you had
a hundred times the manpower

35:34.217 --> 35:35.739
for police at home

35:35.782 --> 35:37.434
and you could spend
whatever you want?

35:37.478 --> 35:39.478
Like the military.

35:39.521 --> 35:41.913
How many deaths
could be prevented?

35:41.956 --> 35:43.260
It wouldn't have stopped you

35:43.304 --> 35:44.565
from walking into
that radio station.

35:44.608 --> 35:46.956
McGEE:
You wanted a voice
for your cause,

35:47.000 --> 35:48.304
but Gator turned you down.

35:50.086 --> 35:51.173
Where's the bomb?

35:53.652 --> 35:54.826
Arthur has it.

35:54.869 --> 35:56.913
Had it. Until last night.

35:56.956 --> 35:58.043
When you attacked him.

35:59.217 --> 36:01.695
I don't know
anything about that.

36:01.739 --> 36:02.913
[phone ringing]

36:04.956 --> 36:06.260
Yeah? Gibbs.

36:06.304 --> 36:08.217
ZIVA:
Arthur Haskell
has been released.

36:08.260 --> 36:10.173
What do you want me to do?Bring him in.

36:10.217 --> 36:12.782
I swear,
I didn't take the bomb.

36:12.826 --> 36:14.130
Why don't you
just ask Arthur?

36:14.173 --> 36:15.521
Yeah, we plan to.
He's on his way in.

36:15.565 --> 36:18.956
Cuff him.

36:19.000 --> 36:21.043
Stand up,
please.

36:21.086 --> 36:22.956
[sighs]

36:26.478 --> 36:28.217
Ah...

36:28.260 --> 36:30.130
They say chamomile tea
is very soothing.

36:31.739 --> 36:34.913
This was all a bluff?

36:34.956 --> 36:35.782
You didn't search my house?

36:37.304 --> 36:39.043
Well, now we know
what to look for.

36:39.086 --> 36:41.304
[hoarsely]:
Your tax dollars at work.

36:47.043 --> 36:48.304
I said I wanted
my lawyer.

36:48.347 --> 36:50.260
I'm not saying anything.

36:52.000 --> 36:54.695
Well...

36:54.739 --> 36:56.521
You don't have
to talk to me.

36:56.565 --> 36:57.956
[sighs]

36:58.000 --> 37:01.173
But I think your daughter
deserves some answers.

37:04.695 --> 37:06.260
[over intercom]:
Kristin?

37:10.695 --> 37:13.000
Let me talk to her.

37:13.043 --> 37:14.695
She's been through hell.

37:14.739 --> 37:16.043
Yeah, well...

37:16.086 --> 37:17.347
this time it's
your fault.

37:18.521 --> 37:20.782
[sighs]

37:22.869 --> 37:24.521
At least let me
apologize to her.

37:24.565 --> 37:25.956
Fine. You can start
right now by helping us.

37:26.000 --> 37:27.130
Who did this?

37:34.521 --> 37:35.826
Matt Lane.

37:37.565 --> 37:39.043
Our mailman.

37:39.086 --> 37:40.956
You tell him your
patriotic group

37:41.000 --> 37:42.782
was stealing money
from al Qaeda?

37:42.826 --> 37:45.086
He snapped.

37:45.130 --> 37:47.130
Said that he and Zach
got tired of waiting.

37:47.173 --> 37:49.086
After what happened
with Adam Gator,

37:49.130 --> 37:50.913
the two of them,
they got reckless.

37:50.956 --> 37:52.565
I wanted to lay low
and wait it out.

38:00.043 --> 38:01.913
All we wanted to do was destroy
that communications tower

38:01.956 --> 38:03.086
at Norfolk Navy Base

38:03.130 --> 38:05.565
as a symbol.

38:08.043 --> 38:10.260
No one was supposed to get hurt.

38:12.391 --> 38:14.173
Matt Lane is doing this alone?

38:14.217 --> 38:15.869
Yeah. He was the one
who was supposed

38:15.913 --> 38:18.173
to get the explosives on base.

38:18.217 --> 38:19.652
In his mail truck.

38:22.043 --> 38:23.304
McGee!

38:30.521 --> 38:32.913
I pulled the GPS data
on Matt Lane's mail truck.

38:32.956 --> 38:34.304
It hasn't been anywhere
near a Navy base

38:34.347 --> 38:36.565
in the past
24 hours.

38:36.608 --> 38:37.913
It's actually been sitting
in front of the post office.

38:37.956 --> 38:39.000
Lane called in sick
this morning.

38:39.043 --> 38:40.913
He's changing targets.

38:40.956 --> 38:42.956
How's he gonna use the
bomb without a detonator?

38:43.000 --> 38:44.652
Don't want to find out.

38:44.695 --> 38:46.434
Where's Lane?

38:46.478 --> 38:49.347
Supervisor, uh, says that
he uses his sick days

38:49.391 --> 38:51.043
to umpire girls'
softball.

38:51.086 --> 38:52.869
According to
the league Web site,

38:52.913 --> 38:54.478
Matt Lane is scheduled

38:54.521 --> 38:57.086
to officiate a game
this afternoon in Fulton Park.

38:57.130 --> 38:58.739
Not exactly a military target.

38:58.782 --> 39:00.086
Depends who's playing.

39:00.130 --> 39:02.000
Pull up the rosters.

39:02.043 --> 39:04.130
All right.
It's just a game

39:04.173 --> 39:06.000
between
two private DC schools.

39:06.043 --> 39:06.739
Just a bunch
of high school girls.

39:06.782 --> 39:07.826
No. Last names, McGee.

39:07.869 --> 39:09.260
Check the
last names.

39:09.304 --> 39:12.173
Some of these names look
awfully familiar, boss.

39:12.217 --> 39:13.521
Judges. Senators.

39:13.565 --> 39:15.000
Military personnel.

39:15.043 --> 39:16.173
Almost every kid on
here is the daughter

39:16.217 --> 39:17.608
of a high-profile
government official.

39:17.652 --> 39:19.478
He's targeting the parents.

39:19.521 --> 39:21.043
Come on. Let's go.

39:21.086 --> 39:23.304
[girls chattering indistinctly]

39:23.347 --> 39:24.782
MAN [over P.A.]:
Be sure to pick up
your tournament T-shirts

39:24.826 --> 39:26.000
at the league concession stand.

39:26.043 --> 39:28.173
[man continues speaking
indistinctly]

39:30.086 --> 39:31.782
[engine starting]

39:36.347 --> 39:37.826
Show me your hands!

39:37.869 --> 39:39.130
Get out of the truck!

39:43.304 --> 39:44.826
You missed a good game.

39:44.869 --> 39:45.739
It's not here, Gibbs.

39:45.782 --> 39:47.695
Where's the bomb?

39:47.739 --> 39:49.217
[handcuffs clicking]

39:49.260 --> 39:52.304
LANE:
Good luck.
You'll never find it.

39:55.130 --> 39:57.043
That's the grill

39:57.086 --> 39:59.086
Lane used at the barbecue
at Royal Woods.

40:01.130 --> 40:03.608
It's a hell of a lot of gas
for cheeseburgers.

40:03.652 --> 40:05.260
He is using the heat buildup
to detonate the explosives.

40:05.304 --> 40:06.478
It's too late.

40:06.521 --> 40:08.347
It's done!

40:08.391 --> 40:10.217
Federal agents!

40:10.260 --> 40:12.130
Clear the area!
Go! Go!

40:12.173 --> 40:13.608
Get out of here! Move!It's a bomb!

40:13.652 --> 40:14.869
[people clamoring]

40:14.913 --> 40:16.347
GIBBS:
Move! Go!

40:16.391 --> 40:18.782
Forget your cheeseburger!
Keep going!

40:18.826 --> 40:19.913
Move! Go!

40:19.956 --> 40:21.086
Tony!

40:22.695 --> 40:24.130
[loud explosion]

40:30.086 --> 40:31.956
[both groaning]

40:35.130 --> 40:36.739
This is nice.

40:36.782 --> 40:38.260
I miss the old Ziva.

40:38.304 --> 40:39.826
I can tell.

40:39.869 --> 40:40.913
Don't flatter yourself.

40:40.956 --> 40:43.478
That's just my knee.

40:43.521 --> 40:45.826
ZIVA:
So Matt Lane planted a bomb,

40:45.869 --> 40:47.565
then stayed behind
to umpire a game

40:47.608 --> 40:49.434
rather than flee the scene?

40:49.478 --> 40:51.434
[hoarsely]:
We told you, Ziva.

40:51.478 --> 40:53.521
It's baseball.

40:53.565 --> 40:54.304
Huh?

40:56.869 --> 40:59.000
Nice.
Nice.

41:00.826 --> 41:03.043
You two need a moment?

41:03.086 --> 41:04.391
You'll understand.

41:04.434 --> 41:05.956
Eventually.

41:06.000 --> 41:07.869
Will I?

41:16.739 --> 41:18.739
Hey, Gibbs?

41:18.782 --> 41:20.391
Have a catch?

41:27.608 --> 41:28.652
[sighs]

41:37.086 --> 41:39.739
McGEE:
Whoa! Look at this!

41:39.782 --> 41:42.043
So you do know a little
something about baseball, huh?

41:44.391 --> 41:47.739
Yeah.

41:47.782 --> 41:50.391
My father taught me.
