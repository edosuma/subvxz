01:28.721 --> 01:33.317
Dude, dude, no, I was, like,
"Yes, we do have nuclear missiles."

01:33.393 --> 01:35.122
And he was all, like, "No, you don't."

01:35.195 --> 01:38.096
And I was all, like,
"Yes, we do. Whatever."

01:38.164 --> 01:41.463
And then I was, like,
"Well, what part of 'whatever'

01:41.534 --> 01:43.195
"do you not get?"

02:17.303 --> 02:19.863
Josh? Josh?

02:25.011 --> 02:28.742
Hey! How many times have I told
you kids not to play ball in this alley?

02:28.815 --> 02:30.510
- Mom!
- Are you all right?

02:30.583 --> 02:34.246
I'm fine. It wasn't a baseball.
There was this thing!

02:34.320 --> 02:37.187
It came from space! It almost hit me!

02:37.257 --> 02:39.782
- A thing came from space?
- Yeah.

02:40.894 --> 02:44.227
You have the biggest imagination, mister.

02:44.297 --> 02:45.787
- But...
- Come here.

02:45.865 --> 02:47.230
- I'm glad you're all right.
- But...

02:47.300 --> 02:49.268
No buts.
It's time to get ready for bed, please.

02:49.335 --> 02:53.362
Here. And don't walk over there
until I pick up that glass, okay?

02:58.011 --> 02:59.444
Awesome.

04:58.331 --> 04:59.730
Knox. Dooley.

04:59.799 --> 05:03.064
Got a report on some kind of fireball
or something like that

05:03.136 --> 05:05.934
over on Liberty Island. Check it out.

05:06.005 --> 05:08.906
No way. A fireball. Cool.
We'll get right on it.

05:08.975 --> 05:10.374
Sarge, can't you get
somebody else to handle it?

05:10.443 --> 05:14.903
- Come on, we just pulled an all-nighter.
- I'm so sorry, Mr. Knox. Tell you what.

05:14.981 --> 05:17.814
Lay down in my office,
and then I'll come by with your blankie,

05:17.884 --> 05:20.216
and you can get yourself a nice nap.

05:20.286 --> 05:23.449
Come on, it's gonna be great. A fireball?
How often do we get a call like that?

05:23.523 --> 05:27.323
Do me a favor, okay?
Act like a cop and stop caring.

06:19.445 --> 06:21.640
Oh, my God.

06:22.315 --> 06:25.546
Oh, my God. Oh, my God, are you all right?

06:25.618 --> 06:28.052
Hello? Please don't be dead!

06:28.121 --> 06:29.986
Oh, did you see that?
He came out of nowhere!

06:30.056 --> 06:32.422
It kind of looked
like you sped up to hit him.

06:32.492 --> 06:35.290
I was going for the parking spot!
Oh, my God.

06:35.361 --> 06:36.851
Oh, Jesus!

06:39.065 --> 06:40.657
Are you all right?

06:40.733 --> 06:43.827
Are you okay? Hello?
Please say something.

06:44.937 --> 06:48.771
Oh, my God, his foot!
I'll call an ambulance!

06:48.841 --> 06:51.139
Oh, God.
Please stay alive, please stay alive,

06:51.210 --> 06:55.476
please stay alive, please stay alive.
This is such bad karma from...

06:58.684 --> 07:00.675
- Where did he go?
- I don't know.

07:01.487 --> 07:03.011
Mr. Guy?

08:00.680 --> 08:03.342
- This will take some time.
- Copy that.

08:15.695 --> 08:17.185
<i>All clear.</i>

08:31.777 --> 08:33.711
Repairs underway, sir.

08:35.581 --> 08:37.105
Damage report.

08:49.362 --> 08:51.557
Right Arm, all well.

08:51.631 --> 08:53.292
Left Arm, ready.

08:57.169 --> 08:59.569
<i>- Casualties, Doctor?</i>
- Abrasions, contusions.

08:59.639 --> 09:01.834
Nothing significant, Captain.

09:04.410 --> 09:05.877
<i>Engineering?</i>

09:06.612 --> 09:08.409
Running diagnostics, sir.

09:10.650 --> 09:12.743
<i>Lieutenant Buttocks, what is your status?</i>

09:13.686 --> 09:17.087
Captain, we had a small gas leak.
It was silent, but not deadly.

09:22.528 --> 09:26.225
Well, crew, it seems
our ship has survived the impact.

09:26.299 --> 09:29.826
<i>Actually, diagnostics</i>
<i>are not encouraging, Captain.</i>

09:29.902 --> 09:33.235
This collision was unexpected,
so our impact shields weren't activated.

09:33.306 --> 09:36.036
<i>How long can we operate at full capacity?</i>

09:36.108 --> 09:40.477
Forty-eight Earth hours at most.
After that, system functions will fail.

09:40.546 --> 09:43.538
- And our tracking computer?
<i>- Down, sir.</i>

09:43.616 --> 09:46.346
That means we only have
the last known coordinates of the orb.

09:46.419 --> 09:50.788
It can be anywhere within 10,000
square meters of our current location.

09:51.457 --> 09:53.220
No. 2, Options?

09:54.327 --> 09:57.353
We could continue on the mission, sir,
but it's extremely risky.

09:57.430 --> 10:00.024
The prudent course would be
to return to our home planet, Nil,

10:00.099 --> 10:01.930
and repair the ship.

10:06.138 --> 10:07.935
Assemble the crew.

10:08.774 --> 10:13.108
Ladies and gentlemen, prepare for
an address by your esteemed captain!

10:16.282 --> 10:19.479
This is it.

10:19.552 --> 10:22.715
This is the moment
that we've all been training for.

10:22.788 --> 10:24.756
We all know what's at stake.

10:24.824 --> 10:28.954
Our planet is on the verge
of a catastrophic energy crisis.

10:29.028 --> 10:30.928
The device we sent to this world
to drain its oceans

10:30.997 --> 10:35.434
has been knocked off course
and is lost somewhere in this city.

10:35.501 --> 10:39.460
Once it is found and deployed,
the salt from this world

10:39.538 --> 10:42.507
shall power our home world
for ages to come.

10:43.309 --> 10:49.009
<i>Without it, our people</i>
<i>will perish in less than one generation.</i>

10:49.081 --> 10:51.572
I will not permit that to happen.

10:52.918 --> 10:54.545
We must succeed.

10:57.723 --> 10:59.384
- For Nil.
- For Nil.

10:59.458 --> 11:01.289
- For Nil.
- For Nil.

11:01.927 --> 11:03.724
Back to your posts.

11:04.697 --> 11:06.289
No. 3.

11:06.365 --> 11:08.026
Do we have sufficient
linguistic information

11:08.100 --> 11:09.465
to help communicate with these natives?

11:09.535 --> 11:13.062
Yes. I tapped into their central
planetary databank, named "Google."

11:13.139 --> 11:15.198
What a frivolous name
for such a vital function.

11:15.274 --> 11:18.641
Well, if you prefer,
there's another called "Yahoo!"

11:18.711 --> 11:20.508
Baffling.

11:20.579 --> 11:22.513
- What about...
- Cultural and historical references?

11:22.581 --> 11:25.448
- Already on it, Captain.
- Good.

11:25.518 --> 11:29.045
- No. 4, is security prepared?
- Yes, sir.

11:29.121 --> 11:32.454
My team can handle any threat
posed by these gargantuan savages.

11:32.525 --> 11:34.584
- Good.
- Initial reports confirm

11:34.694 --> 11:35.820
that draining this planet's oceans

11:35.895 --> 11:39.160
would have
a catastrophic effect on existing life.

11:39.231 --> 11:43.793
We have orders, No. 3.
Our entire home world is depending on us.

11:43.869 --> 11:45.564
Agreed.

11:45.638 --> 11:48.971
We should not lament
the fates of these inferior creatures.

11:49.041 --> 11:51.009
If the orb has fallen into their hands,

11:51.077 --> 11:54.740
who knows for what nefarious purpose
they could be using it

11:54.814 --> 11:56.611
at this very moment?

12:13.399 --> 12:16.300
Mom, there's a drunk guy
in the alley again!

12:18.237 --> 12:19.602
- That's him.
- Who?

12:19.672 --> 12:22.436
- The guy I just hit with my car.
- You're kidding. Again?

12:22.508 --> 12:24.942
Oh, I barely clipped that other guy.

12:25.010 --> 12:26.773
Sir, coronal gas readings just spiked.

12:26.846 --> 12:29.371
- The orb must be nearby.
<i>- Hello?</i>

12:29.448 --> 12:32.975
<i>Hello, sir, hi. Hello? Hi, there.</i>

12:33.052 --> 12:36.579
<i>- Hello, sir? Hi, are you all right?</i>
- Contact, everyone!

12:36.655 --> 12:38.680
<i>- Because you just ran off.</i>
- No. 17.

12:38.758 --> 12:39.986
<i>- Return to the ship.</i>
- Copy.

12:40.059 --> 12:43.790
I'm worried. I really feel terrible
about what just happened.

12:43.863 --> 12:45.524
Can I call you an ambulance or something?

12:45.598 --> 12:48.499
Any medical attention for... For your foot?

12:51.470 --> 12:52.960
Your foot.

12:53.038 --> 12:55.506
Our first verbal encounter.

12:56.809 --> 12:58.242
Thank you for your concern.

12:58.310 --> 13:00.437
<i>Thank you for your concern.</i>

13:01.280 --> 13:03.942
It's way too high. More bass!

13:04.583 --> 13:06.414
<i>Thank you for your concern.</i>

13:06.485 --> 13:07.952
Level the frequency.

13:08.854 --> 13:10.788
I'm all better now.

13:11.757 --> 13:14.055
How hard did you hit this guy?

13:15.895 --> 13:18.659
It's time for you to go
to school before you're late, okay?

13:18.731 --> 13:19.789
Mom...

13:19.865 --> 13:23.266
See how she squeezes the smaller
one's skull despite his protests.

13:23.335 --> 13:26.168
<i>- Stop! Stop!</i>
- Such brutality!

13:26.238 --> 13:28.172
- Go on. Goodbye.
- Stop!

13:28.240 --> 13:30.538
Hey, safety first. And if those boys
are after you, you tell me!

13:30.609 --> 13:33.669
- I'm calling their parents.
- Okay.

13:33.746 --> 13:36.874
Would you like to come upstairs for
a glass of water, maybe? Anything?

13:36.949 --> 13:38.940
I can help clean you up.

13:39.018 --> 13:40.815
No, thank you. I am fine.

13:40.886 --> 13:42.581
<i>I am in position.</i>

13:43.322 --> 13:44.880
Are you sure?

13:46.158 --> 13:48.592
Okay, but, see, that's not fine.

13:48.661 --> 13:51.528
So, maybe you should come upstairs,
or I can call an ambulance.

13:51.597 --> 13:54.259
Sir, we cannot let her
contact the authorities.

13:54.333 --> 13:58.133
Agreed. We will go in long enough
to put her mind at ease.

13:58.204 --> 14:01.867
Yes, I will accompany you.
Thank you for your hospitality.

14:02.274 --> 14:03.707
<i>Good.</i>

14:06.312 --> 14:08.246
The thing about my car is,
you gotta pump the brakes.

14:08.314 --> 14:09.645
I mean, I just got it back from the shop,

14:09.715 --> 14:11.478
and I'm seriously considering
suing my mechanic,

14:11.550 --> 14:13.484
because that was just crazy
about what happened.

14:13.552 --> 14:15.247
Oh, sorry, right here! Oh, sorry, right here.

14:17.122 --> 14:19.181
- Hey.
- Hey!

14:19.258 --> 14:20.555
- How you doing?
- How are you?

14:20.626 --> 14:23.151
Good. Good timing.
I got something for you.

14:23.229 --> 14:25.493
Three tubes of cerulean blue.

14:25.564 --> 14:29.056
- I just ran out.
<i>- Hi. Mark Rhodes.</i>

14:29.134 --> 14:32.035
Why does he thrust his arm towards us?

14:32.104 --> 14:34.334
Probably best to imitate him.

14:35.174 --> 14:36.835
Hi. Mark Rhodes.

14:40.546 --> 14:42.207
Lefty, huh? Hey.

14:50.723 --> 14:52.657
<i>- All right.</i>
- All right.

14:53.759 --> 14:55.226
Okay.

14:57.263 --> 14:59.163
- All right.
- All right.

15:02.167 --> 15:03.600
Okay.

15:06.672 --> 15:08.105
- Thanks again.
- Yeah.

15:08.173 --> 15:10.334
- We're going right inside.
- All right, yeah.

15:25.758 --> 15:27.851
Okay, here you go.

15:27.927 --> 15:29.861
Sorry about the mess.

15:29.929 --> 15:35.834
You know, this is sort of
a workspace/home combo thingy, thing.

15:42.608 --> 15:45.133
Right Arm. This is unacceptable.

15:45.210 --> 15:48.179
Sorry! The liquid shifts the equilibrium!

15:51.317 --> 15:54.445
- I still seem to be a bit shaken up.
- Oh, crap.

16:10.302 --> 16:14.136
- There, I feel much better now.
- Oh, good! That is great.

16:14.206 --> 16:15.195
Great news. Good.

16:15.274 --> 16:18.072
So then, you don't need to call
your lawyer, or anything crazy like that,

16:18.143 --> 16:21.340
because that would be just pointless,
wouldn't it?

16:21.413 --> 16:23.973
Good. Oh, I'm Gina, by the way.

16:26.085 --> 16:27.677
Gina Morrison.

16:28.687 --> 16:30.177
And you are?

16:31.924 --> 16:33.448
Three?

16:33.525 --> 16:36.824
This is a list of the most common
names on this planet.

16:36.895 --> 16:38.556
My name is...

16:39.598 --> 16:42.328
- Ming Chang.
- Ming Chang?

16:43.168 --> 16:47.628
Sorry. Sorry, you just struck me
more like a Dave, or something.

16:47.706 --> 16:50.368
Which happens to be my other name.

16:50.442 --> 16:52.842
Dave Ming Chang?

16:53.879 --> 16:55.779
Dave Ming Chang.

16:55.848 --> 16:59.807
Dave Ming Chang. All right, well, Dave,

16:59.885 --> 17:03.946
I feel just terrible about this whole thing,
and I was gonna have some breakfast.

17:04.022 --> 17:05.285
Would you like to join me?

17:05.357 --> 17:08.258
- No, I really have to be going now.
- Are you sure?

17:08.327 --> 17:11.785
I mean, I sort of have a rule that,
when I hit somebody with my car,

17:11.896 --> 17:14.194
I need to make them breakfast.

17:17.069 --> 17:18.695
That was a joke.

17:29.281 --> 17:31.772
So where are you from?
Do you live around here?

17:31.850 --> 17:34.978
Yes, of course. I am just a regular
person from right here on Earth,

17:35.054 --> 17:36.578
just like you.

17:37.790 --> 17:39.348
I just don't get out that much.

17:39.425 --> 17:43.088
Yeah, judging from your suit,
I'd say since about 1978.

17:44.396 --> 17:47.957
Note, all-white apparel is not
as standardized as we thought.

17:48.033 --> 17:50.297
You late for a Bee Gees concert
or something?

17:50.369 --> 17:53.702
The Bee Gees. Barry, Robin and Maurice,
the Brothers Gibb.

17:53.772 --> 17:57.139
Winning ten Grammy awards
and selling over 100,000,000 records.

17:57.209 --> 17:59.370
<i>Oh, you can tell by the way I use my walk</i>

17:59.445 --> 18:01.572
<i>I'm a woman's man No time to talk</i>

18:03.482 --> 18:05.006
<i>Stayin' alive</i>

18:07.519 --> 18:10.613
Wow. That's impressive
love for the Bee Gees, man.

18:10.689 --> 18:13.317
I'm sorry, I had no idea.
You know? Foot in the mouth.

18:13.392 --> 18:15.952
<i>Listen, do you mind</i>
<i>whipping these up for me?</i>

18:16.028 --> 18:17.723
<i>That would be so great. Just a little help.</i>

18:17.796 --> 18:21.254
I'm so used to making breakfast for Josh,
and all he wants is waffles.

18:21.333 --> 18:23.130
Anyway, he's off to school now.

18:23.202 --> 18:25.568
Yeah, I don't know,
he's got these bullies after him right now.

18:25.637 --> 18:26.695
You don't have any kids, do you?

18:26.772 --> 18:29.002
I mean, you don't really seem
like a kid person, but...

18:29.074 --> 18:31.565
Anyway, I just, I try to be there for him,

18:31.643 --> 18:33.474
but I don't really know
how to deal with it, you know.

18:33.545 --> 18:37.743
I'm just doing the single mom thing,
and I'm so permissive of everything.

18:37.816 --> 18:40.580
Oh, my God, I am talking your ear off.

18:43.255 --> 18:46.691
- All is well.
- Okay, why don't you just take a seat?

18:46.758 --> 18:49.249
And I can finish this.

18:49.328 --> 18:51.159
Here, you like ketchup?

18:51.230 --> 18:53.596
- Oh, thank you.
- You're welcome.

19:04.910 --> 19:07.538
Refreshing. I feel much better now.

19:11.250 --> 19:12.911
That's a new one.

19:16.855 --> 19:20.052
Oh, that's our cat, Boris.
I hope you're not allergic.

19:20.125 --> 19:21.888
Are you?

19:21.960 --> 19:23.860
Cats. Here we go, sir.

19:32.171 --> 19:34.230
Boris, what are you up to?

19:37.576 --> 19:39.271
- Captain.
- Yes?

19:39.344 --> 19:42.438
Yes, my husband was
a captain with the Navy.

19:43.549 --> 19:46.814
- I am a captain.
- Really? A captain of what?

19:49.288 --> 19:51.347
I am a captain of crunch.

19:53.559 --> 19:57.996
- Where is your captain now?
- Frank died four years ago,

19:58.063 --> 20:00.327
so it's just me and Josh now.

20:00.966 --> 20:04.163
It's been rough sometimes,
but we're okay.

20:04.236 --> 20:06.602
There is a strength to this one.

20:07.539 --> 20:09.200
Captain, the orb!

20:18.083 --> 20:19.550
Where was this image captured?

20:19.618 --> 20:23.816
<i>That's Josh at school, the science fair.</i>
<i>He always walks around with this thing.</i>

20:23.889 --> 20:26.881
See, he thinks it fell from outer space.

20:26.959 --> 20:30.019
- We must locate the boy.
- We're on it, sir.

20:30.095 --> 20:31.960
729 East 44th Street.

20:33.065 --> 20:35.829
I really have to be going now.
Thank you for the ketchup.

20:36.702 --> 20:40.695
Okay. You know,
the eggs are just another...

20:41.640 --> 20:45.337
That's the closet.

20:50.882 --> 20:53.282
Sorry about hitting you with my car.

20:53.919 --> 20:57.184
A couple of frat punks get drunk,
miss the last ferry,

20:57.256 --> 21:00.453
stick a rag in their bottle of Stoli,
and then, kaboom!

21:00.525 --> 21:03.790
Suddenly, my morning roll in the hay
with Tracy gets canceled.

21:03.862 --> 21:06.387
I think this is explosive residue.

21:08.367 --> 21:12.895
Don't. Don't do this, Dooley.
I see you getting interested in this.

21:12.971 --> 21:15.940
I see that wacko <i>X Files</i> gleam in your eye.

21:27.386 --> 21:31.049
That might be the boy, there!
In that group of Earth children.

21:31.123 --> 21:32.112
What structure is this?

21:32.190 --> 21:35.455
It appears to be
some sort of shrine to technology.

21:43.468 --> 21:48.428
This is the best they have to offer?
Their mini-computers are gigantic!

21:48.507 --> 21:52.443
And a slamming home page
means more online buddies.

21:52.511 --> 21:55.309
Dude, while you're waiting,
check these out.

21:55.380 --> 22:00.511
Awesome surround-sound headphones.
Seven ounces, left and right quad.

22:00.585 --> 22:02.883
The sound will blow you away.

22:05.424 --> 22:06.516
Is that insane?

22:06.591 --> 22:09.492
It's like the subwoofers
are actually inside your head.

22:12.130 --> 22:14.690
Damage reports coming in
from all parts of the ship, Captain!

22:14.766 --> 22:17.394
Sir! Structural integrity weakening!

22:25.010 --> 22:26.807
We have got to get out of here!

22:38.357 --> 22:41.622
The sign clearly indicates, "Do not walk."

22:41.693 --> 22:46.858
And yet, they keep walking
and walking and walking!

22:47.866 --> 22:51.302
Apparently, chaos
is the order of the day here.

22:51.370 --> 22:52.837
Doctor,

22:54.439 --> 22:56.168
is Two all right?

22:57.275 --> 22:58.572
This is a big planet.

22:58.643 --> 23:02.841
There might be contaminants
we've never encountered before.

23:02.914 --> 23:04.040
I'll keep an eye on it.

23:33.678 --> 23:36.704
Why don't you take a picture?
It lasts longer.

23:41.887 --> 23:43.479
It's the ice cream man!

23:43.555 --> 23:45.284
Ice cream man, over here!

23:45.357 --> 23:48.622
- Ice cream!
- Hey, look, it's the Good Humor man!

23:51.196 --> 23:52.823
It's this suit again!

23:52.898 --> 23:54.923
How in Nil did we wind up
with this wardrobe debacle?

23:55.000 --> 23:58.163
- We must have missed something.
- I can't see how, sir.

23:58.236 --> 24:01.501
We carefully studied the only signal
ever intercepted from Earth.

24:01.940 --> 24:04.408
<i>The plane! The plane!</i>

24:06.945 --> 24:08.173
When we enter the boy's school,

24:08.246 --> 24:11.113
we must not draw any
undue attention to ourselves.

24:11.183 --> 24:14.641
Yes, we must rid ourselves
of this inappropriate attire

24:14.719 --> 24:19.383
and replace it with clothing that is
the epitome of both hip and now.

24:19.458 --> 24:21.255
Welcome to Old Navy!

24:24.930 --> 24:28.024
- Any ideas?
- Likely a ritual greeting, sir.

24:28.099 --> 24:29.623
Welcome to Old Navy!

24:30.902 --> 24:34.235
- Welcome to Old Navy!
- Welcome to Old Navy!

24:34.306 --> 24:36.103
Welcome to Old Navy!

24:36.174 --> 24:37.766
Welcome to Old Navy!

24:37.843 --> 24:40.607
Welcome to Old Navy.

24:44.049 --> 24:45.846
Welcome to Old Navy!

24:49.588 --> 24:51.647
Welcome to Old Navy.

24:53.158 --> 24:55.388
Can I help you find your size?

24:56.561 --> 24:59.553
I am obviously
the same size as everyone else.

24:59.631 --> 25:02.191
I just meant are you a small, or...

25:08.139 --> 25:11.199
I believe he simply wants to know
the dimensions of your clothing.

25:12.377 --> 25:15.574
Yes, you can help me find my size.

25:15.647 --> 25:17.478
Welcome to Old Navy.

25:19.818 --> 25:22.685
Crew, prepare for
an unrehearsed maneuver.

25:31.129 --> 25:32.619
Come on!

25:33.498 --> 25:36.524
- What the...
<i>- Sorry, sir! It won't happen again!</i>

25:40.338 --> 25:44.399
I can help you if you'd...
How about I help you take that.

25:44.976 --> 25:46.807
Very...

25:46.878 --> 25:50.006
Yes, this is my size. Welcome to Old Navy!

25:55.220 --> 25:59.850
Excuse me. Do you have a private chamber
where I can try on these garments?

25:59.925 --> 26:02.553
Changing room back there behind hoodies.

26:02.627 --> 26:04.117
Welcome to Old Navy.

26:29.220 --> 26:31.780
Sir, we have arrived at the school.

26:33.892 --> 26:34.950
This can't be right.

26:35.093 --> 26:41.794
<i>One singular sensation</i>
<i>Every little step she takes</i>

26:42.801 --> 26:44.428
Apologies, sir.

26:44.502 --> 26:46.902
Apparently we are on West 44th Street.

26:49.174 --> 26:55.010
<i>One smile</i>
<i>and suddenly nobody else will do</i>

26:58.750 --> 27:01.310
Let's get out of here. Double-time.

27:13.598 --> 27:15.793
- Hey!
- What do you got here, little freak?

27:15.867 --> 27:20.270
- That's mine!
- What do you use it for, playing nerd-ball?

27:20.338 --> 27:23.330
- Whatever it is, it's mine now.
- Give it back!

27:23.408 --> 27:25.842
Or what?
You gonna tell your mommy again?

27:26.544 --> 27:27.875
Can I help you?

27:27.946 --> 27:30.437
I am here for the fifth-grade classroom.

27:30.515 --> 27:33.040
Okay, all right, you're very late,
but you're here, at least.

27:33.118 --> 27:36.485
It's been a madhouse.
Half the teachers are out with the flu.

27:36.554 --> 27:39.489
I'm just gonna... I'm gonna have to
throw you to the wolves.

27:45.530 --> 27:48.226
Don't say a word. I will mess you up.

27:49.968 --> 27:51.833
Josh Morrison.

27:51.903 --> 27:54.394
What are you doing here?
Are you the sub?

27:54.472 --> 27:56.804
You would know the sub, loser!

27:58.343 --> 28:01.141
I don't know him!
My mom hit him with her van!

28:01.212 --> 28:04.045
I am Dave Ming Chang, the sub.

28:09.387 --> 28:10.718
What is your name?

28:10.789 --> 28:13.758
- Smellmy.
- Smellmy what?

28:13.825 --> 28:15.588
Smellmy Buttcrack.

28:17.128 --> 28:20.222
I am sure the other Buttcracks
would disapprove of your behavior.

28:20.298 --> 28:22.630
You don't look like a teacher.

28:23.435 --> 28:25.460
<i>I'm going to report you.</i>

28:25.537 --> 28:29.564
- Vaporize the child at once!
- Delay that order.

28:29.641 --> 28:35.136
I am indeed your temporary instructor,
which I shall prove to you now. Observe.

28:35.213 --> 28:38.148
Let's teach them something simple,
shall we?

28:51.329 --> 28:52.762
What the...

28:58.737 --> 29:03.731
The unified field theory. The ultimate
pearl of wisdom in all of the universe.

29:03.808 --> 29:05.708
Now you are educated.

29:06.344 --> 29:09.108
- What is your destination?
- I'm gonna sharpen my pencil.

29:09.180 --> 29:11.114
Here, let me assist you.

29:16.955 --> 29:20.186
- There.
- Thanks, I think.

29:21.559 --> 29:24.357
Josh Morrison. Come with me.

29:26.231 --> 29:30.133
What are you doing here?
You're not really the sub, are you?

29:31.269 --> 29:32.759
You have something that is mine.

29:32.837 --> 29:37.797
It is a small spherical device,
2.7 inches in diameter.

29:37.876 --> 29:39.468
How'd you hear about that?

29:39.544 --> 29:43.173
And how can it be yours
if it came from outer space?

29:43.248 --> 29:45.478
Are you an alien?

29:45.550 --> 29:47.415
We've been compromised!

29:47.485 --> 29:49.578
I'm just messing with you.

29:51.823 --> 29:54.621
That's very funny.
It's very important that I find it.

29:54.692 --> 29:56.751
Do you know where it is?

29:57.462 --> 30:01.125
Let me guess.
It's, like, top secret or something.

30:01.199 --> 30:04.168
Yes. It is top secret or something.

30:04.235 --> 30:08.433
Will you help us, I mean me, find it?

30:09.474 --> 30:12.910
Look, I don't have it anymore.
This jerk took it.

30:14.412 --> 30:16.073
Well, we have to get it back.

30:16.147 --> 30:18.411
- Where is this jerk?
- His name is Rich.

30:18.483 --> 30:21.008
Him and his buddies are
probably headed for the deli.

30:21.085 --> 30:23.883
- Lead and I will follow.
- Okay, come on.

30:39.270 --> 30:41.170
Such disturbing images.

30:43.208 --> 30:46.735
- Rich isn't here.
- Do you know where Rich lives?

30:46.811 --> 30:49.678
No, but sometimes
I run into him in the neighborhood.

30:49.747 --> 30:51.840
Everybody on the floor, now!

30:51.916 --> 30:54.783
Empty the register and no one gets hurt.

30:55.954 --> 30:59.822
This planet continues
to reveal its ugly nature.

30:59.891 --> 31:01.620
It deserves its fate.

31:01.693 --> 31:05.789
- I said, on the floor, now!
- I am already on the floor.

31:05.864 --> 31:08.856
Gravity prevents me from floating off of it.

31:09.634 --> 31:11.295
Get down now!

31:17.642 --> 31:19.371
Big mistake, man.

31:29.587 --> 31:32.181
Hey, you have forgotten your weapon!

31:33.157 --> 31:35.125
Dave, wait!

31:35.193 --> 31:39.596
<i>That was awesome! I mean, you</i>
<i>totally threw that guy across the room.</i>

31:39.664 --> 31:42.428
I was very fortunate not to be injured.

31:42.500 --> 31:46.402
And the gun.
No normal person could have done that.

31:46.471 --> 31:48.996
Do you have, like,
superpowers or something?

31:49.073 --> 31:50.472
Do you know
what would be very pleasant?

31:50.541 --> 31:53.374
If we were to change
the subject of our conversation.

31:53.444 --> 31:55.878
Did you see
last night's sports competition?

31:55.947 --> 31:59.781
You see? There's another thing.
You talk so weird.

31:59.851 --> 32:02.684
- Come on, tell me, what's your secret?
- I have no secret.

32:02.754 --> 32:06.781
- Oh, yeah? Quick, where are you from?
- I am from right here in this city.

32:06.858 --> 32:09.452
Where exactly? Give me an address.

32:11.362 --> 32:12.920
The Statue of Liberty.

32:12.997 --> 32:15.090
You live at the Statue of Liberty?

32:15.166 --> 32:18.533
Yes, the Ming Changs have lived at the
Statue of Liberty for many generations.

32:18.603 --> 32:21.436
Now, let us locate the orb.

32:21.506 --> 32:25.499
Look, I don't know where Rich is now,
but tomorrow's my mom's birthday.

32:25.576 --> 32:28.670
We're going to our neighborhood
street fair. Everybody goes.

32:28.746 --> 32:31.146
I'm sure he's gonna be there.

32:31.215 --> 32:34.946
You know, if you want,
you could come with me and my mom.

32:36.487 --> 32:39.615
Sir, we can't wait until tomorrow.
Our power supply is dwindling.

32:39.691 --> 32:43.684
This child is useless.
We must find the orb on our own.

32:45.697 --> 32:49.463
I disagree. Without guidance,
we might not find it in time.

32:50.168 --> 32:54.002
Contrary to expectations,
Josh has been quite helpful to us.

32:54.072 --> 32:55.562
We will stick with him.

32:59.243 --> 33:01.211
Man, you are awesome at this!

33:01.279 --> 33:04.305
It's like you've got
super video-game powers, too.

33:04.382 --> 33:07.545
- Are you sure you're not a superhero?
- Absolutely.

33:07.618 --> 33:12.021
Fine, I give up. I'm just happy to be
able to play with somebody besides Mom.

33:12.090 --> 33:14.081
Interacting with your mother
makes you unhappy?

33:14.158 --> 33:16.922
Nah, I don't mean to complain. She tries.

33:16.995 --> 33:19.691
It's just that Dad was a lot better.

33:19.764 --> 33:21.994
You know, my dad was a hero in real life.

33:22.066 --> 33:26.025
- He saved, like, a million people one time.
- That is impressive.

33:26.104 --> 33:28.436
Yeah, we miss him. Especially Mom.

33:28.506 --> 33:31.373
Now she spends all her time
smothering me.

33:31.442 --> 33:34.843
- She cuts off your air supply?
- Josh, I'm home!

33:34.912 --> 33:38.439
Oh, hey! What are you doing back here?

33:38.516 --> 33:40.108
Some guys with a gun
tried to rob the store,

33:40.184 --> 33:42.152
and Dave stopped them
and saved everyone!

33:42.220 --> 33:44.347
- It was awesome!
- What? What gun?

33:44.422 --> 33:45.616
- Mom, Mom.
- Are you all right?

33:45.690 --> 33:50.024
Mom, I'm fine! It was so cool!
Dave just took them out.

33:50.094 --> 33:52.426
Man, I wish I could do that.
But look at me.

33:52.497 --> 33:55.432
I'm the smallest fifth-grader
in New York City.

33:55.500 --> 33:59.664
- You are not small. You are a giant.
- Yeah, right.

34:04.108 --> 34:07.737
Josh, the most powerful force
in all the universe

34:07.812 --> 34:10.406
often comes from the smallest star.

34:16.120 --> 34:19.715
Dave? Would you like to stay for supper?

34:19.791 --> 34:24.420
Sir, the longer we're in their presence,
the greater the danger of exposure.

34:29.400 --> 34:30.889
Yes, I will stay.

34:33.871 --> 34:35.031
Good.

34:35.773 --> 34:38.297
Although, if you thought
my driving was dangerous,

34:38.376 --> 34:41.139
wait till you try my meatloaf.

34:41.212 --> 34:42.201
Meat Loaf?

34:51.289 --> 34:53.655
- What are you looking for?
- I don't know.

34:53.724 --> 34:55.315
I'll tell you when I find it.

34:55.393 --> 34:57.054
You know something, Dooley?
We gotta find you a new hobby.

34:57.128 --> 34:59.722
Stevie, please just hold the insult.

34:59.831 --> 35:00.855
Please.

35:00.932 --> 35:02.991
Oh, I forgot today
was Arts and Crafts Day.

35:29.227 --> 35:32.390
Dave, would you mind
helping me clear the table?

35:40.204 --> 35:44.197
You know, don't worry about it.
I got it. I'm...

35:44.275 --> 35:45.640
This is something I do all the time.

35:45.710 --> 35:49.476
I'm constantly dropping stuff.
Don't even worry about it.

35:50.381 --> 35:52.849
<i>"Men Are from Mars,</i>
<i>Women Are from Venus. "</i>

35:53.684 --> 35:56.653
Yeah, that's my...

35:56.721 --> 36:00.748
I would... My sister got that for me.
I would never...

36:01.159 --> 36:03.252
She just thinks I need
to get back in the game, and...

36:03.728 --> 36:07.186
Tell your sister there is no life on Mars!
Believe me.

36:08.432 --> 36:09.865
Okay.

36:15.706 --> 36:18.106
This rendering. What is it?

36:21.546 --> 36:25.141
That's just something I felt.

36:27.685 --> 36:30.210
- You felt this.
- Yeah, I did.

36:31.489 --> 36:34.822
I did. I don't really paint like that anymore.

36:34.892 --> 36:36.359
And why not?

36:37.428 --> 36:39.487
Well, things have changed.

36:43.301 --> 36:48.170
And what is the feeling
demonstrated here?

36:50.474 --> 36:52.942
Well, how does it make you feel?

36:54.979 --> 36:56.173
Feel?

36:59.784 --> 37:04.153
It makes me feel off-balance.

37:04.222 --> 37:06.053
Off-balance, yeah.

37:06.123 --> 37:08.614
That's... That's close.

37:08.693 --> 37:12.686
I remember when I painted this,
I just felt love.

37:12.763 --> 37:15.231
Huge and exciting and crazy,

37:15.299 --> 37:17.290
just love.

37:21.739 --> 37:27.769
How do you know when you feel love?

37:28.779 --> 37:31.179
<i>Oh, I think when you feel love,</i>

37:32.416 --> 37:35.146
you don't need to ask that question.

37:37.855 --> 37:39.345
I see.

37:46.797 --> 37:48.765
Time for me to exit into the night.

37:50.368 --> 37:51.460
Okay.

37:51.535 --> 37:55.528
Well, thank you again
for being there for Josh today and...

37:56.374 --> 38:00.538
And, yeah, I think tomorrow will be fun.
I'm glad you're coming with us.

38:00.611 --> 38:02.602
So am I, Gina Morrison.

38:04.815 --> 38:06.305
Okay.

38:07.985 --> 38:10.545
- Good night, Dave.
- Good night, Gina.

38:25.469 --> 38:27.630
Do you mind if I rest here?

38:28.806 --> 38:30.296
Sure.

38:30.775 --> 38:34.176
This appears to be a safe port.
We'll join this urban camper.

38:39.917 --> 38:41.475
You ain't crazy, are you?

38:41.552 --> 38:45.181
The last guy was here,
he said he was from outer space.

38:45.923 --> 38:47.390
What planet?

38:48.726 --> 38:50.751
And the party continues.

38:52.630 --> 38:56.498
Here. Here you go.
Gets a little chilly at night.

39:01.105 --> 39:03.300
Did you see that?

39:03.374 --> 39:05.467
This man has nothing,

39:05.543 --> 39:08.876
yet he offers to share
his sole source of warmth.

39:11.115 --> 39:12.207
Why?

39:12.283 --> 39:15.912
It seems they are a more complex species
than we imagined.

39:26.564 --> 39:29.328
- Yes?
- My findings are incomplete,

39:29.400 --> 39:33.359
but I have noted more atypical behavior
spreading throughout the ship.

39:33.437 --> 39:34.927
Is that so?

39:35.005 --> 39:38.736
Well, I think we all just need
a good night's rest, Doctor.

40:01.098 --> 40:03.066
- Dang!
- Excuse me?

40:18.149 --> 40:20.140
Working rather late, No. 3.

40:20.217 --> 40:23.015
I was just doing
some additional cultural research.

40:23.087 --> 40:25.112
And what have you found?

40:25.189 --> 40:29.592
I stumbled onto an interesting file
in the alien database, sir.

40:30.895 --> 40:34.661
Every man, woman and child
is forced to view it once a year.

40:35.633 --> 40:38.397
It could be helpful in understanding them.

40:38.469 --> 40:39.936
Show me.

40:42.306 --> 40:45.400
You have not changed
since our days at the Academy.

40:45.476 --> 40:48.206
I remember the late nights
studying together.

40:48.279 --> 40:50.770
And the nutritious protein squares
you prepared for us.

40:50.848 --> 40:54.443
I would not have been able to graduate
without your help.

40:55.886 --> 41:01.017
And, yet, here you've become
our generation's most renowned captain.

41:02.560 --> 41:04.027
Yes.

41:06.730 --> 41:08.220
Here it is.

41:13.003 --> 41:15.870
<i>What is it you want, Mary?</i>
<i>What do you want?</i>

41:15.940 --> 41:18.500
<i>You want the moon? Just say the word</i>

41:18.576 --> 41:21.272
<i>and I'll throw a lasso around it</i>
<i>and pull it down.</i>

41:21.345 --> 41:24.837
<i>Hey, that's a pretty good idea.</i>
<i>I'll give you the moon, Mary.</i>

41:24.915 --> 41:25.904
<i>I'll take it.</i>

41:50.741 --> 41:52.299
Lasso the moon?

41:53.377 --> 41:56.244
- Physically impossible!
- Absurd.

42:07.725 --> 42:11.320
- Good night, Captain.
- Yes, Three, good night.

42:13.497 --> 42:17.126
I must say, sir,
these Earth creatures keep surprising me.

42:17.201 --> 42:20.602
A most confusing place.
It makes my head spin.

42:20.671 --> 42:23.071
I guess I'd better hold on, then.

43:11.589 --> 43:14.217
I want to send this out
to every precinct, every security company

43:14.291 --> 43:17.260
and every hospital in the city
until we ID this guy right here.

43:17.328 --> 43:20.729
This is incredible. Just amazing.

43:20.798 --> 43:24.063
Amazing that two idiots like you
could've passed the police exam.

43:24.134 --> 43:26.261
- See? I tried to tell him, Sarge.
- Hold on.

43:26.337 --> 43:29.738
It is a fact, a fact, that something
or someone has landed here.

43:29.807 --> 43:32.901
Now, we could be making the biggest
scientific discovery of all time.

43:32.977 --> 43:36.674
I don't want to hear another word
about E.T., Bigfoot or the Tooth Fairy,

43:36.747 --> 43:39.944
unless they're jacking some old lady's car.

43:41.018 --> 43:43.646
- You got that?
- Yes, sir.

43:43.721 --> 43:45.882
- That's good aim, Sarge.
- Shut up!

43:47.091 --> 43:50.288
- Dooley. What are you doing?
- I'm sending it anyway, Knox.

43:50.361 --> 43:52.761
No, it's just a guy
who shoved his face in the dirt.

43:52.830 --> 43:54.593
No, wrong. It is an alien,

43:54.665 --> 43:58.761
an alien who shoved his face in the dirt,
and I am gonna find him.

44:11.715 --> 44:16.618
Power reserves at <i>20%,</i> sir.
That only gives us about 12 hours.

44:16.687 --> 44:20.453
Then every minute counts.
Remember our mission, crew.

44:20.524 --> 44:23.823
We must find the boy with the orb.
No distractions.

44:55.559 --> 44:57.618
This is not acceptable!

44:59.129 --> 45:00.426
<i>And here we go, ladies and gentlemen.</i>

45:00.497 --> 45:03.728
<i>Chuck starts off fast out of the gate,</i>
<i>eating down those dogs,</i>

45:03.801 --> 45:09.068
<i>but Earl and Homer are right behind him.</i>
<i>Look at them go! Look at them go!</i>

45:09.139 --> 45:13.041
- Come on, Dave, eat!
- Dave, just put it in your mouth!

45:13.110 --> 45:17.069
- What are you doing? Eat it!
- Just put one in your mouth, Dave!

45:18.415 --> 45:20.906
- Put it in, come on, now!
- Dave! Dave, eat!

45:21.485 --> 45:23.612
You never should have
signed him up for this.

45:24.722 --> 45:29.250
- What are you doing, Dave? Eat!
- Eat it, Dave! Put it in your mouth!

45:31.562 --> 45:33.496
Yeah, all right! Yeah! Yeah!

45:34.498 --> 45:36.989
A little heads-up might be nice!

45:40.671 --> 45:44.698
Hey! Can a brother
get some hot sauce with that?

45:45.409 --> 45:47.036
Look at him go!

46:00.023 --> 46:04.585
<i>Our champion!</i>
<i>Eighty-five delicious all-beef hot dogs!</i>

46:04.661 --> 46:05.821
Yeah!

46:08.866 --> 46:10.561
Yeah, boy! Yeah!

46:13.270 --> 46:15.067
Well executed, Captain.

46:15.139 --> 46:19.132
Dave, that was amazing!
You are a wiener-eating champ!

46:19.209 --> 46:21.439
<i>And here's the grand prize.</i>

46:24.581 --> 46:26.378
We're under attack!

46:26.450 --> 46:29.146
It's the creature from Thanos 7!
Battle stations!

46:29.219 --> 46:32.814
You have menaced us
for the last time, you beast!

46:44.802 --> 46:48.863
It seems that this is
an inanimate creature.

46:50.240 --> 46:52.105
At ease!

46:52.176 --> 46:56.806
The question is, what are we expected
to do with this plush amphibian?

46:58.348 --> 47:00.339
Give it to her, Captain.

47:01.919 --> 47:04.444
The female. Give it to her.

47:07.758 --> 47:09.191
Silly goose.

47:11.662 --> 47:13.721
You are such a goofball.

47:20.470 --> 47:25.032
For me? Thanks, Dave. That was...

47:25.108 --> 47:27.167
That's very sweet.

47:27.244 --> 47:29.178
<i>Red alert, Captain! Red alert!</i>

47:29.680 --> 47:35.585
We need to dispose of the large quantity
of processed meat tubes!

47:37.187 --> 47:38.654
Excuse me.

47:39.256 --> 47:41.816
My colon is impacted.

47:45.529 --> 47:46.757
Okay.

48:10.754 --> 48:12.244
Show-off!

48:18.128 --> 48:20.619
Excuse me! Excuse me, we met yesterday.

48:20.697 --> 48:23.165
- Mark Rhodes.
- Mark Rhodes?

48:24.935 --> 48:27.403
- Right. The left again.
- Yeah.

48:40.083 --> 48:42.711
- So, you here by yourself?
- No, I am not.

48:42.786 --> 48:44.845
I am accompanying Josh and Gina.

48:44.922 --> 48:47.891
All evening we have been
screaming with fear and delight.

48:47.958 --> 48:51.018
Look, you and I
should get something straight,

48:51.094 --> 48:53.324
and I'm not trying to
step on your toes, here.

48:53.397 --> 48:55.558
If you're serious about Gina,
then that's great,

48:55.632 --> 48:58.465
because she deserves
a decent guy in her life,

48:58.535 --> 49:01.231
but if I find out that you're just
trying to take advantage of her,

49:01.305 --> 49:03.637
and you're using Josh to do it,

49:03.707 --> 49:06.642
you and I
are gonna have a serious problem.

49:08.278 --> 49:10.610
You understand what I'm saying?

49:11.448 --> 49:14.246
Yes, I understand completely,
Mark Rhodes.

49:15.652 --> 49:17.847
Does anyone here understand
what this man is talking about?

49:17.921 --> 49:20.856
He's trying to discern if you intend
on becoming Gina's mate.

49:20.924 --> 49:22.414
What an absurd notion!

49:22.492 --> 49:26.394
I intend on becoming Gina's mate?
She's the size of our science pavilion.

49:26.463 --> 49:29.955
These primitive creatures
and their silly speculations!

49:31.535 --> 49:33.560
Wait! What's that?

49:35.038 --> 49:38.064
- What do you want, midget?
- Rich, you gotta give me my rock back.

49:38.141 --> 49:39.199
Oh, really? Why?

49:39.276 --> 49:41.574
Because it's really important
to me and my friend, Dave.

49:41.645 --> 49:43.078
It's the jerk we seek!

49:43.146 --> 49:45.239
Rich, you've gotta give me my rock back!

49:45.315 --> 49:48.011
Boy, it's like
you're asking me to punch you!

49:48.085 --> 49:50.781
So, Smellmy, we meet again.

49:50.854 --> 49:52.116
Dave.

49:58.061 --> 50:00.461
Stop! You're giving me a wedgie!

50:04.334 --> 50:07.030
Stop! Please put me down, already!

50:13.143 --> 50:15.441
Smellmy, are you crying
because you are sad

50:15.512 --> 50:19.505
or because your undergarments are
lodged so cuttingly deep in your rectum?

50:19.583 --> 50:21.676
I'm telling my mom.

50:21.752 --> 50:24.084
Mom! Mom!

50:26.356 --> 50:29.120
Dave, that was unbelievable! High-five!

50:32.462 --> 50:35.158
They don't high-five where you're from?

50:35.232 --> 50:37.860
- No, but they should.
- There you two are!

50:37.934 --> 50:39.458
What kind of trouble you getting into?

50:39.536 --> 50:44.337
Nothing. Dave was just about
to try out his pitching arm!

50:45.709 --> 50:47.904
- Come on, Dave.
- Go, Dave! Go, Dave!

50:47.978 --> 50:51.505
- You just gotta hit three. Here we go.
- Come on! Come on, come on!

50:51.581 --> 50:53.344
Go, Dave! Go, Dave!

50:54.518 --> 51:01.287
Sir, the orb is ours.
This charade is no longer necessary.

51:01.358 --> 51:04.919
It's time to throw it in the ocean
and head home.

51:04.995 --> 51:07.759
You're absolutely right, Two,

51:07.831 --> 51:11.961
but I really think I can do this.

51:13.503 --> 51:15.368
He looks very serious.

51:15.439 --> 51:17.031
Looking good, looking good.
Come on, you can do it!

51:17.107 --> 51:18.870
Here we go. He's gonna do it!

51:20.177 --> 51:21.667
Wind up!

51:24.347 --> 51:25.712
All right, well...

51:25.782 --> 51:29.047
Spectacularly unsuccessful!
Why was my wrist so limp?

51:29.653 --> 51:31.883
I was in the bathroom.

51:34.791 --> 51:36.088
On my command.

51:36.159 --> 51:38.559
- Come on, you can hit it.
- Two more. Come on.

51:38.628 --> 51:40.255
Come on. Come on.

51:43.867 --> 51:45.334
Fire!

51:47.037 --> 51:48.595
Incoming!

51:53.477 --> 51:54.808
Engineer, report!

51:54.878 --> 51:59.042
All sensors are down and the sun shields
deployed upon impact.

51:59.116 --> 52:01.050
Sir, we're blacked out.

52:07.858 --> 52:10.827
The sun is exploding in my face!

52:11.428 --> 52:14.727
I still haven't got a pulse.
Give me the paddles, stat.

52:14.798 --> 52:17.028
- Oh, God. Don't watch.
- Clear!

52:18.835 --> 52:20.803
Come on. Give me more juice.

52:20.871 --> 52:22.099
Clear!

52:25.942 --> 52:27.671
Power has been restored.

52:27.744 --> 52:31.236
Oh, thank God!
Oh, God, is he gonna be okay?

52:32.282 --> 52:34.614
We'll do an MRI just to be safe.

52:34.684 --> 52:36.515
He's okay. He's okay.

52:39.556 --> 52:41.786
How we doing? I have to warm it up first,

52:41.858 --> 52:44.520
but just to double-check,
they took your keys, watch, coins?

52:44.594 --> 52:46.494
- Yes.
- Good.

52:46.563 --> 52:50.659
'Cause people always forget
the "M" in MRI stands for "magnetic."

52:52.736 --> 52:55.261
This'll just take a second.

53:03.446 --> 53:05.971
I guess I still have a few pennies.

53:07.651 --> 53:09.551
I'm so sorry to have ruined your birthday.

53:10.487 --> 53:12.148
Thanks for letting the cat out of the bag.

53:12.222 --> 53:15.214
- Cat? Where's the cat?
- You know, it's okay,

53:15.292 --> 53:18.489
because I'm not really
one for celebrating anyway.

53:18.562 --> 53:21.326
Well, perhaps you will reconsider
and let us take you out for dinner.

53:21.398 --> 53:22.865
Yeah.

53:24.901 --> 53:28.359
Sir, with all due respect,
have you lost your mind?

53:28.438 --> 53:32.204
They've helped us.
The least we can do is try to help them.

53:33.043 --> 53:35.944
You have become a fool!

53:36.012 --> 53:39.607
Treating these lumbering giants
as if they're our equals.

53:39.683 --> 53:42.618
You've made a mockery
of our entire mission!

53:43.286 --> 53:46.084
You get out of my face. Now!

53:53.797 --> 53:55.526
<i>Dave?</i>

53:55.599 --> 53:57.260
<i>Dave? Hello?</i>

53:57.334 --> 53:59.928
- Right here.
<i>- Hey, where'd you go?</i>

54:00.003 --> 54:01.630
I am here.

54:01.705 --> 54:05.607
I'm so curious sometimes,
what's going on in that head of yours.

54:05.675 --> 54:07.973
I was just pondering which would be
the best place to take you

54:08.044 --> 54:10.410
to commemorate your birthday.

54:10.480 --> 54:13.916
Josh, do you have any suggestions?
Perhaps a nice Cuban place?

54:13.984 --> 54:16.043
I know a great salsa restaurant.

54:18.021 --> 54:20.990
All right, well, <i>sí, amigos,</i> let's go party.

54:21.791 --> 54:24.919
Everyone! We're going to go and party!

54:45.482 --> 54:47.746
Okay, three mojitos, one virgin.

54:47.817 --> 54:49.148
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

54:49.219 --> 54:51.119
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

54:51.187 --> 54:53.348
- Thank you.
- There you go. You enjoy.

54:53.423 --> 54:55.721
- Cheers.
- Happy birthday, Mom.

54:55.792 --> 54:57.419
Thank you.

54:58.261 --> 55:01.253
Now, careful.
These go straight to your head.

55:22.552 --> 55:25.487
This is not acceptable!

55:27.357 --> 55:29.086
Slow down, cowboy.

55:32.762 --> 55:34.559
This is the best!

55:34.631 --> 55:38.192
Cougar46 just added me as a friend.

55:38.268 --> 55:39.758
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

55:41.304 --> 55:44.535
He walked out about an hour ago
with a nice-looking lady and a kid.

55:44.607 --> 55:48.771
- Oh, really? Nice-looking? She pretty hot?
- Please! Please.

55:48.845 --> 55:51.143
- You sure it's him?
- Absolutely.

55:51.214 --> 55:53.478
Said they were going
to a Cuban salsa place.

56:07.997 --> 56:09.259
You gotta try this.

56:09.332 --> 56:13.268
It's like space travel, only in your head.

56:20.243 --> 56:26.341
I've been having strange feelings
since we've arrived on this planet.

56:27.717 --> 56:30.914
- It seems you are, too?
- Absolutely not.

56:30.987 --> 56:35.048
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I'm recalibrating our weapon systems.

56:35.125 --> 56:36.319
Just a second.

56:41.765 --> 56:45.531
Exactly what weapon
are you recalibrating?

56:45.869 --> 56:47.666
Okay, let's talk.

56:48.872 --> 56:50.669
I'm feeling a little busted.

56:56.146 --> 56:57.977
You know, pretty soon
you're gonna be too old

56:58.047 --> 56:59.275
to dance with your mom.

56:59.349 --> 57:02.079
Excuse me while I run to the restroom.

57:02.719 --> 57:04.186
Josh.

57:04.254 --> 57:06.279
I will be going home soon.

57:11.161 --> 57:13.527
What is the matter with you?

57:13.596 --> 57:17.999
When you're gone, everything's just
gonna go back to the way it was.

57:18.067 --> 57:20.126
I'm not like other kids.

57:20.203 --> 57:22.467
I can't even fight for myself.

57:23.106 --> 57:25.267
My dad was a hero.

57:25.341 --> 57:27.036
But me?

57:27.110 --> 57:30.341
I'm just different.

57:33.049 --> 57:36.109
Josh, listen to me.

57:36.186 --> 57:40.350
We would never have been able
to find the orb without you.

57:40.423 --> 57:43.654
Not everyone would have helped us,
but you did.

57:43.726 --> 57:46.160
Because you are different.

57:47.130 --> 57:49.997
I am very lucky to have a friend like you.

57:50.533 --> 57:53.764
- You're just saying that.
- No, I am not.

57:53.837 --> 57:57.637
You have helped us greatly.
We are all in great debt to you.

57:58.641 --> 58:00.108
I did?

58:00.510 --> 58:03.502
Yes. We are saved, Josh.

58:16.259 --> 58:19.387
She thinks she's so hot. She's not hot.
Have you seen her butt?

58:19.462 --> 58:23.956
- It's like the size of our moon.
- You are so bad.

58:24.033 --> 58:26.934
Bad and gorgeous!

58:32.008 --> 58:35.034
Okay, another one. I took the liberty.

58:35.912 --> 58:37.709
I love this song.

58:42.385 --> 58:45.286
Need anything, Captain?

58:45.355 --> 58:48.518
Yes, I may need
some music references for...

58:52.862 --> 58:55.262
<i>Dave, will you do me the honor?</i>

58:55.331 --> 58:56.764
<i>Come on!</i>

58:57.033 --> 58:58.500
<i>It'll be fun.</i>

58:58.701 --> 59:01.898
Yes, yes, I would,
I'd love to dance with you.

59:01.971 --> 59:03.962
<i>You're gonna love it!</i>

59:06.309 --> 59:10.177
Here, it's really easy.
Just let the music take you.

59:10.246 --> 59:13.238
All hands, stay alert,
and obey my commands to the letter.

59:13.316 --> 59:16.114
- Captain, might I have a word?
- Make it brief.

59:16.185 --> 59:19.313
There are emotional dangers
on this planet we did not foresee.

59:19.389 --> 59:21.550
We are on the brink of anarchy.

59:21.624 --> 59:23.649
Not now.
I'm trying to let the music take me!

59:23.726 --> 59:26.024
All right, crew, everyone,
let's get it together, now!

59:26.195 --> 59:27.628
All together!

59:27.697 --> 59:29.426
Precision!

59:29.499 --> 59:32.332
Right foot! Left foot!

59:38.641 --> 59:41.041
Okay. Here, just follow my lead.

59:44.380 --> 59:47.178
We should be fulfilling our mission,
trying to save our planet,

59:47.250 --> 59:53.280
not leaping around like some sort of idiot,
attempting to woo a gigantic strumpet!

59:53.356 --> 59:56.325
This captain has become a joke.

59:57.360 --> 01:00:00.955
This is over the line, sir.
The Captain still deserves our respect.

01:00:01.030 --> 01:00:03.965
<i>Shake my hips like this! More hips! Hips!</i>

01:00:04.033 --> 01:00:07.434
<i>Yes, that's it! More hips!</i>
<i>Look, I'm dancing!</i>

01:00:07.503 --> 01:00:09.232
All right, I'm in.

01:00:11.674 --> 01:00:13.266
The dancing stops now.

01:00:15.645 --> 01:00:18.512
Here, here. Hand here. Okay?

01:00:18.581 --> 01:00:21.482
I need more wiggle in the posterior region!

01:00:21.851 --> 01:00:24.479
Captain, if I may?

01:00:24.554 --> 01:00:26.044
You think that you can do better?

01:00:26.122 --> 01:00:29.319
Nothing personal, sir,
but that won't be hard.

01:00:29.492 --> 01:00:30.959
Take charge.

01:00:32.929 --> 01:00:35.124
Okay, boys and girls, everybody listen up!

01:00:35.198 --> 01:00:36.187
You're gonna give me a basic,

01:00:36.265 --> 01:00:38.529
stepping forward with the left
and back with the right.

01:00:38.601 --> 01:00:40.592
Don't bounce, and do not over think it.

01:00:50.480 --> 01:00:52.948
We're gonna put your accoutrements
right up against her.

01:00:53.049 --> 01:00:54.414
Drop down.

01:00:59.355 --> 01:01:01.323
This is salsa, people. Let's make it spicy!

01:01:04.427 --> 01:01:05.792
Follow me!

01:01:22.912 --> 01:01:25.244
I knew you were holding out on me.

01:01:26.282 --> 01:01:27.806
Come on, come on, girl.

01:01:27.884 --> 01:01:31.217
I'm about to show you
how to do the forbidden dance.

01:01:32.422 --> 01:01:34.014
It's my birthday!

01:01:34.691 --> 01:01:37.023
And dip her, like a cookie in milk.

01:01:37.093 --> 01:01:38.958
I feel good. I feel loose.

01:01:39.028 --> 01:01:42.464
I feel good. I feel loose. I feel good.

01:01:44.534 --> 01:01:45.592
Hey!

01:01:58.047 --> 01:01:59.708
Freeze!

01:01:59.816 --> 01:02:02.808
- Everybody, stay calm.
- Hands up. Hands up!

01:02:04.587 --> 01:02:06.350
Should we power up blasters?

01:02:06.422 --> 01:02:08.083
No.

01:02:08.925 --> 01:02:10.893
Too many innocent civilians.

01:02:11.327 --> 01:02:13.192
Easy, folks, easy.

01:02:13.262 --> 01:02:16.231
- Step back, please.
- Dave?

01:02:16.299 --> 01:02:18.460
Hey, welcome to Earth.

01:02:38.654 --> 01:02:40.053
Greetings.

01:02:44.927 --> 01:02:47.054
We don't want to hurt you.

01:02:49.232 --> 01:02:51.757
We don't want to hurt you.

01:02:53.202 --> 01:02:54.829
We're you're friends.

01:02:54.904 --> 01:02:58.635
All we want to know
is why you've come down to our planet.

01:02:58.708 --> 01:03:00.175
Oh, for God sake.

01:03:01.177 --> 01:03:03.941
Stay calm. They can't prove anything.

01:03:04.781 --> 01:03:06.180
<i>What is your purpose here?</i>

01:03:06.849 --> 01:03:08.749
What is your purpose here?

01:03:08.818 --> 01:03:10.809
- The mystery is what your purpose here is.
- Okay, you know what?

01:03:10.887 --> 01:03:13.321
I'm trying to do a thing, and you're not
helping me out, so please stop.

01:03:15.625 --> 01:03:17.092
Greetings!

01:03:18.127 --> 01:03:19.719
No. 2, what are you doing?

01:03:19.796 --> 01:03:22.492
- You can't do this, Two.
- Excuse me?

01:03:22.565 --> 01:03:26.092
We're playing
by my rules now, Ex-Captain!

01:03:26.169 --> 01:03:27.636
Seize him!

01:03:30.907 --> 01:03:35.674
- You cannot do this, No. 2!
- Can, and will.

01:03:35.745 --> 01:03:39.340
- You brought this on yourself.
- What are we supposed to do?

01:03:39.415 --> 01:03:42.213
You do what you took an oath to do
and protect me, your captain, Four.

01:03:42.285 --> 01:03:44.651
Stay back, Four.
I don't want to see anyone get hurt.

01:03:44.720 --> 01:03:47.883
You'll never get away with this, Two.
The rest of the crew will not support you!

01:03:47.957 --> 01:03:51.222
Oh, yes, they will.
Because they have a mission to complete.

01:03:51.961 --> 01:03:53.724
Three, you're supporting this?

01:03:53.796 --> 01:03:55.457
Yes, I see no other way.

01:03:55.531 --> 01:03:58.796
That's because there is no other way.

01:03:58.901 --> 01:04:01.028
Whoa, who left the speaker on?

01:04:01.103 --> 01:04:02.570
Shut that off!

01:04:07.410 --> 01:04:11.278
Officer Dooley, can I speak to you outside?
Just for a minute.

01:04:15.151 --> 01:04:18.382
You will regret this.
Something has been awakened in all of us.

01:04:18.454 --> 01:04:20.479
Something you will never be able to stop.

01:04:20.556 --> 01:04:24.583
Looks like I just did.
Confine him to his quarters!

01:04:26.562 --> 01:04:29.531
Attention, crew! As of this moment,

01:04:29.599 --> 01:04:33.558
un-Nilian behavior
will no longer be permitted.

01:04:33.636 --> 01:04:35.433
In fact, it will be punished.

01:04:35.504 --> 01:04:36.937
Severely.

01:04:37.006 --> 01:04:40.134
A new era has begun,
with me as your leader.

01:04:40.209 --> 01:04:42.575
You know,
we just met him a couple days ago,

01:04:42.645 --> 01:04:44.476
- like I've said five times.
- Hey.

01:04:44.547 --> 01:04:46.014
- Hey!
- You guys all right?

01:04:46.082 --> 01:04:48.778
Yes. It's been a long night.

01:04:48.851 --> 01:04:50.045
- What do they want with him?
- I don't know.

01:04:50.119 --> 01:04:52.383
He didn't do anything wrong!

01:04:54.490 --> 01:04:56.583
Stand and engage blasters!

01:04:57.693 --> 01:04:58.990
Sir?

01:05:00.096 --> 01:05:01.825
I gave you an order.

01:05:02.298 --> 01:05:03.560
Yes, sir.

01:05:04.267 --> 01:05:06.827
- Did you not just hear those voices?
- Yes, I heard the voices.

01:05:06.903 --> 01:05:10.566
Wow, we got a nutjob living
in New York City. What are the odds?

01:05:10.640 --> 01:05:12.198
So what are you saying?
We should just let him go?

01:05:12.275 --> 01:05:14.470
Yes, I think we should let him go!
That's exactly what I'm saying!

01:05:14.543 --> 01:05:18.502
That's the most ridiculous thing
I've ever heard in my entire life!

01:05:19.148 --> 01:05:20.274
Hey!

01:05:23.586 --> 01:05:25.486
Activate heat shields.

01:05:29.091 --> 01:05:31.457
- Freeze!
- Look out!

01:05:33.562 --> 01:05:37.225
This guy's crazy!
Somebody about to get killed!

01:05:37.300 --> 01:05:39.928
I'm out! Son of a...

01:05:45.541 --> 01:05:46.940
Take cover!

01:05:57.453 --> 01:05:59.614
You, woman and child,

01:05:59.689 --> 01:06:03.352
you have wasted enough time
with your pathetic emotional distractions.

01:06:03.426 --> 01:06:04.859
Dave?

01:06:04.927 --> 01:06:08.954
<i>Your undisciplined human frailty</i>
<i>causes nothing but chaos!</i>

01:06:09.031 --> 01:06:11.329
And one other thing,
your so-called artwork

01:06:11.400 --> 01:06:13.891
is both pretentious and sophomoric.

01:06:19.976 --> 01:06:21.967
I could do this all day.

01:06:32.688 --> 01:06:33.916
Freeze!

01:06:44.567 --> 01:06:48.059
Three, find me the fastest route
to the landing site.

01:06:48.137 --> 01:06:49.627
Three, I...

01:06:51.941 --> 01:06:53.408
Guards!

01:06:55.144 --> 01:06:58.807
No. 12! Have you been working out?

01:06:59.815 --> 01:07:01.578
You can tell?

01:07:01.650 --> 01:07:02.844
No.

01:07:06.022 --> 01:07:07.614
Yes.

01:07:07.690 --> 01:07:09.988
- Thank you, Three.
- I didn't do this to help you.

01:07:10.059 --> 01:07:11.959
I did this to stop that lunatic!

01:07:12.028 --> 01:07:17.295
- What have I done to hurt you so?
- You really can't be that oblivious!

01:07:17.366 --> 01:07:19.766
Listen to me. Whatever I have
done to hurt you, I apologize,

01:07:19.835 --> 01:07:21.268
but right now we have to
get to the engine room

01:07:21.337 --> 01:07:24.636
- and shut down the ship!
- Fine! Let's just go.

01:07:25.441 --> 01:07:26.908
What in Nil is your problem?

01:07:27.443 --> 01:07:28.603
Are you all right, Josh?

01:07:28.677 --> 01:07:32.238
Mom, I'm fine, but something's wrong.
That can't be Dave!

01:07:32.314 --> 01:07:35.647
You have to trust me.
We need to go after him.

01:07:35.718 --> 01:07:37.310
No, Josh, we're not doing that.

01:07:37.386 --> 01:07:39.479
- I know you want to protect me.
- Of course.

01:07:39.555 --> 01:07:43.719
But Dave is my friend,
and I need to protect him right now.

01:07:43.793 --> 01:07:45.784
- Josh.
- If we don't help him,

01:07:45.861 --> 01:07:49.319
something terrible's gonna happen.
I know it!

01:07:49.999 --> 01:07:52.763
I was just making conversation to ease
the apparent tension between us.

01:07:52.835 --> 01:07:56.066
- Don't. You're making it worse.
- You know what...

01:08:04.680 --> 01:08:07.945
No. 3, didn't take you long to betray me.

01:08:08.017 --> 01:08:09.746
This is not the answer, Two!

01:08:09.819 --> 01:08:13.687
You weren't Nilian enough
to do your duty,

01:08:13.756 --> 01:08:16.747
- so you left me no choice.
- Listen to reason.

01:08:16.826 --> 01:08:19.350
We thought that Earth was not
worth preserving. We were wrong.

01:08:19.428 --> 01:08:20.952
There's much we've learned
from this place.

01:08:21.029 --> 01:08:25.261
- We must not hurt these people!
- Yes, we must!

01:08:26.402 --> 01:08:32.432
And since you two seem to love
these gargantuan beasts so much,

01:08:32.508 --> 01:08:34.669
have fun living among them.

01:08:38.180 --> 01:08:40.671
I have a little tickle in my nose.

01:09:01.703 --> 01:09:03.831
- Follow me!
- No, follow me!

01:09:07.176 --> 01:09:09.371
Three, I'm so sorry
that you're out here with me.

01:09:09.444 --> 01:09:11.140
Not half as sorry as I am!

01:09:11.212 --> 01:09:14.774
Please, we'll have the entire
journey back home to argue.

01:09:15.484 --> 01:09:19.215
- This may not be the best spot, sir.
- And why not?

01:09:22.358 --> 01:09:24.019
Mother of Nil!

01:09:37.006 --> 01:09:38.234
Three!

01:09:42.344 --> 01:09:45.438
- I'm coming, Three. Don't move.
- Great advice, Captain.

01:09:45.514 --> 01:09:47.413
Because I can't!

01:09:54.657 --> 01:09:56.784
- Are you all right, Three?
- Please! You have no concern for me.

01:09:56.859 --> 01:09:59.157
All you care about is Gina,
your big, fat girlfriend!

01:09:59.228 --> 01:10:00.217
You think that she's fat?

01:10:00.296 --> 01:10:02.059
If she wears a size infinity,

01:10:03.866 --> 01:10:05.697
then she's fat!

01:10:09.004 --> 01:10:12.440
It takes me almost getting run over
for you to even notice me!

01:10:12.508 --> 01:10:14.976
I'm practically invisible to you!

01:10:16.612 --> 01:10:19.513
Invisible? Quite the opposite.
When I look at you, what I see is

01:10:19.582 --> 01:10:20.879
the ship!

01:10:25.921 --> 01:10:28.048
I love New York. Let's go!

01:10:34.063 --> 01:10:35.963
Trust me, Three. Jump!

01:10:43.505 --> 01:10:44.995
It's working!

01:10:53.148 --> 01:10:55.343
You see? Just as I planned!

01:11:07.830 --> 01:11:09.991
Look, if we let go
at precisely the right moment,

01:11:10.065 --> 01:11:11.555
we'll be propelled to the ship.

01:11:12.434 --> 01:11:13.731
On three.

01:11:14.503 --> 01:11:20.169
One, two, three!

01:11:26.515 --> 01:11:27.777
Three.

01:11:29.151 --> 01:11:32.814
I asked for you
to be assigned to this mission

01:11:32.888 --> 01:11:37.348
because you are kind,
intelligent and beautiful,

01:11:37.426 --> 01:11:40.554
more so than anyone
I've ever known in my life.

01:11:41.130 --> 01:11:42.893
And without you,

01:11:44.566 --> 01:11:46.329
I would be nothing.

01:11:48.504 --> 01:11:51.598
Why have you never
spoken to me of this before?

01:11:52.341 --> 01:11:55.071
Because I was too Nilian to express it.

01:11:56.078 --> 01:11:59.570
I should have lassoed the moon
for you long ago.

01:12:14.930 --> 01:12:17.490
But now let's turn the ship around.

01:12:25.774 --> 01:12:28.937
We'll never get there at this rate.
Give me full power to the legs!

01:12:29.011 --> 01:12:33.175
<i>I told you. Our power is nearly depleted.</i>

01:12:37.252 --> 01:12:39.880
Crew, prepare to hail a cab!

01:12:42.424 --> 01:12:43.482
Taxi!

01:12:49.365 --> 01:12:52.391
What? An alien cannot
get a cab in this town?

01:12:58.407 --> 01:13:01.774
Hey, buddy! This is my cab!
What are you doing?

01:13:02.811 --> 01:13:06.440
Liberty Island Ferry. Make haste or die.

01:13:08.517 --> 01:13:12.351
Yes, every available cop in the city,
and the Feds.

01:13:12.421 --> 01:13:16.824
I knew it. I knew it, I knew it!
I knew we were not alone in this universe.

01:13:16.892 --> 01:13:20.487
- Look, I'm not convinced he's an alien.
- Oh, you're not?

01:13:21.663 --> 01:13:25.258
- So what?
- So what? So, who you calling?

01:13:25.334 --> 01:13:26.995
- Homeland Security.
- Don't do that.

01:13:27.069 --> 01:13:29.299
They're gonna overreact!
We don't even know why he's visiting yet.

01:13:29.371 --> 01:13:32.033
Well, it's obviously not a peace mission!

01:13:32.107 --> 01:13:34.598
Get those big slobbery lips away from me!

01:13:34.676 --> 01:13:36.667
And while you suckers
are sitting here talking,

01:13:36.745 --> 01:13:38.679
he about to go suck your planet dry!

01:13:38.747 --> 01:13:41.079
I need somebody
from Homeland Security, please.

01:13:41.150 --> 01:13:43.015
I don't have the extension.

01:13:43.085 --> 01:13:44.518
- Are you with Dave?
- No.

01:13:44.586 --> 01:13:47.282
No, no. I come free with a venti latte.

01:13:47.356 --> 01:13:48.983
Of course I'm with Dave, stupid!

01:13:49.057 --> 01:13:52.026
- I need... Hey, you got a comment?
- No.

01:13:53.595 --> 01:13:56.758
I need the extension from you guys
because I don't have it.

01:13:57.466 --> 01:14:00.299
- Do you know where he went?
- Yes, I do.

01:14:00.369 --> 01:14:02.269
I need a ride, though.

01:14:03.105 --> 01:14:05.573
- Okay.
- Well, what you waiting for?

01:14:05.974 --> 01:14:07.134
Okay.

01:14:08.277 --> 01:14:09.938
Wait, wait, wait.

01:14:11.313 --> 01:14:12.940
Don't be shaking me.

01:14:13.015 --> 01:14:14.846
Sorry. I apologize.

01:14:14.950 --> 01:14:17.646
Don't be blowing on me!
I don't know you that well!

01:14:17.719 --> 01:14:20.517
Slow down. Slow. Wait. Wait, wait.
Wait, I said slow down now!

01:14:20.589 --> 01:14:22.056
Wait, it's dark in here. I'm in.

01:14:22.124 --> 01:14:25.582
Please, hurry. Dooley, where you going?

01:14:25.661 --> 01:14:27.390
Hey, Sarge, you got
a little schmutz right here.

01:14:27.463 --> 01:14:28.760
Shut up!

01:14:32.100 --> 01:14:36.127
- How many tickets you got?
- I've never been caught speeding.

01:14:36.205 --> 01:14:37.900
In New York.

01:14:37.973 --> 01:14:39.372
This year.

01:14:45.414 --> 01:14:47.439
Long live Nil.

01:14:48.050 --> 01:14:52.180
Sorry, Earth. Sometimes No. 2 happens!

01:14:54.056 --> 01:14:55.887
Captain! Thank goodness you're back.

01:14:55.958 --> 01:14:57.550
No. 2's become a raging lunatic.

01:14:57.626 --> 01:15:01.187
Not to worry, kind friend.
I'm back, and I'm taking over.

01:15:04.333 --> 01:15:05.800
<i>Welcome, Captain.</i>

01:15:19.748 --> 01:15:20.840
<i>Right Arm!</i>

01:15:20.916 --> 01:15:24.477
- What the devil is this?
<i>- Someone's overriding the system!</i>

01:15:24.553 --> 01:15:27.420
Only the Captain has the code to...

01:15:28.757 --> 01:15:30.224
The Captain!

01:15:55.651 --> 01:15:57.448
You are in my chair!

01:16:00.222 --> 01:16:01.484
Guards!

01:16:01.557 --> 01:16:04.685
- Put down your weapons.
- Seize him!

01:16:04.760 --> 01:16:09.390
Guards, I said seize him!
You've seen what a fool he's been!

01:16:09.464 --> 01:16:15.266
We all know I am the only one
qualified to get us home.

01:16:17.573 --> 01:16:20.565
Is this what you want? This chaos?

01:16:24.313 --> 01:16:26.281
We choose our Captain.

01:16:28.216 --> 01:16:30.582
This planet rocks. Deal with it.

01:16:35.557 --> 01:16:37.388
Get out of my chair.

01:16:42.864 --> 01:16:44.354
Captain, the orb is in the water.

01:16:44.433 --> 01:16:48.028
The siphoning process
is getting stronger by the minute.

01:16:53.475 --> 01:16:55.306
Right Arm, summon the orb.

01:16:55.377 --> 01:16:59.507
Captain, the fight
drained our power below 1 <i>%.</i>

01:16:59.581 --> 01:17:04.382
I can re-route booster energy,
but there won't be enough for take-off.

01:17:07.055 --> 01:17:10.183
Well, Captain, it seems you have a choice.

01:17:10.959 --> 01:17:14.258
Save this planet or save yourself.

01:17:15.764 --> 01:17:17.629
I choose this planet.

01:17:19.167 --> 01:17:21.294
And what of your beloved crew?

01:17:21.370 --> 01:17:24.669
Are you willing
to condemn them to the same fate?

01:17:24.740 --> 01:17:28.232
Stranded here in a world of behemoths?

01:17:29.578 --> 01:17:32.513
I believe it is the right thing to do,

01:17:32.581 --> 01:17:35.744
but I cannot
make this decision for all of you.

01:17:37.519 --> 01:17:39.749
I say we save Earth.

01:17:39.821 --> 01:17:41.311
And its moon.

01:17:43.492 --> 01:17:46.256
My life began on this planet.

01:17:46.328 --> 01:17:48.489
I no longer feel like No. 3.

01:17:50.766 --> 01:17:54.702
I am Dave Ming Chang.

01:17:54.770 --> 01:17:58.365
<i>I have 443 new friends on MySpace</i>

01:17:58.440 --> 01:18:02.809
and a JDate next week
with a woman named Sheila Moskowitz.

01:18:02.878 --> 01:18:06.939
I am Dave Ming Chang.

01:18:07.716 --> 01:18:09.707
I am Dave Ming Chang.

01:18:09.785 --> 01:18:13.846
- I am Dave Ming Chang.
- I am Dave Ming Chang.

01:18:13.922 --> 01:18:17.619
- I am Dave Ming Chang.
- I am Dave Ming Chang.

01:18:17.693 --> 01:18:21.925
I am Johnny Dazzles, and I am fabulous!

01:18:23.632 --> 01:18:27.033
What? Not everybody
has to be Dave Ming Chang.

01:18:29.104 --> 01:18:31.595
You've all gone completely mad!

01:18:31.673 --> 01:18:34.267
Take him and put him

01:18:34.342 --> 01:18:35.969
in my butt.

01:18:42.651 --> 01:18:45.745
Engineer, divert all remaining power
to Right Arm.

01:19:36.004 --> 01:19:38.529
- Way to go, Right Arm!
<i>- Yes!</i>

01:19:46.248 --> 01:19:47.772
Dave! Are you okay?

01:19:47.849 --> 01:19:51.979
Dave! What is happening?
How can we help you?

01:19:52.053 --> 01:19:54.886
Thank you, but it is too late.

01:19:54.956 --> 01:19:56.856
We are out of power.

01:19:56.925 --> 01:20:00.656
We'll never get back now. It is over.

01:20:00.729 --> 01:20:04.563
Hands behind your head! Understand?
Step away from that thing!

01:20:04.633 --> 01:20:06.931
- No!
- Hey! Let us handle this, folks, okay?

01:20:07.002 --> 01:20:08.993
You don't need your guns, all right?
Don't hurt him!

01:20:09.070 --> 01:20:10.594
We're not gonna hurt anybody.

01:20:10.672 --> 01:20:12.663
- We're just gonna talk.
- Dooley, enough!

01:20:12.741 --> 01:20:15.505
You've seen what that thing can do.
Hands behind your head!

01:20:15.577 --> 01:20:18.341
<i>Captain, with no shield and no power,</i>

01:20:18.413 --> 01:20:21.712
<i>the projectile from his weapon</i>
<i>will breach the hull.</i>

01:20:21.783 --> 01:20:23.444
We'll take casualties.

01:20:23.518 --> 01:20:25.110
He can't move!
He doesn't have any power left!

01:20:25.187 --> 01:20:27.621
- Hands behind your head!
- He can't move!

01:20:27.689 --> 01:20:28.781
- Josh!
- Kid!

01:20:28.857 --> 01:20:30.256
Josh!

01:20:39.734 --> 01:20:42.168
We have power. We have been saved.

01:20:42.237 --> 01:20:43.966
All hail Josh the hero!

01:20:49.578 --> 01:20:51.671
Stay right where you are!

01:20:55.383 --> 01:20:59.251
Yeah, if you're trying to freak me out,
it's not gonna work.

01:21:01.857 --> 01:21:04.849
All right, that's gonna freak me out a little.
Do you see that?

01:21:04.926 --> 01:21:07.224
- I do.
- Is that a guy?

01:21:07.295 --> 01:21:08.819
- Looks like it.
- Like a really little guy?

01:21:08.897 --> 01:21:10.762
- Like a really little guy.
- On his tongue?

01:21:10.832 --> 01:21:12.925
What'd I just say?

01:21:13.001 --> 01:21:15.333
- Hello.
- You, you see that, right?

01:21:15.403 --> 01:21:18.201
- There's a little guy in there?
- He's talking.

01:21:18.273 --> 01:21:20.741
- Yeah.
- Dave.

01:21:21.810 --> 01:21:24.438
I apologize to all of you.

01:21:24.512 --> 01:21:28.141
It was my second-in-command
who took control of my ship by force,

01:21:28.216 --> 01:21:31.083
and it was he, not I, who performed
these unspeakable acts of cruelty.

01:21:31.152 --> 01:21:32.779
Will you put that thing down?
Would you please?

01:21:32.854 --> 01:21:37.086
I mean, the guy's an inch tall.
You look like a wuss. Right?

01:21:37.158 --> 01:21:41.219
Josh, my friend.
You helped save two worlds today.

01:21:42.197 --> 01:21:46.065
And you taught me the true meaning
of friendship and courage.

01:21:46.902 --> 01:21:49.769
Your father would have been proud
of his young captain.

01:21:49.838 --> 01:21:52.932
Promise me you'll always take pride
in being different.

01:21:53.541 --> 01:21:55.805
- I promise.
- High-five.

01:21:58.046 --> 01:22:00.674
Perhaps that's not such a great idea.

01:22:05.086 --> 01:22:08.146
- Gina.
- Yeah. Yeah, hi.

01:22:08.223 --> 01:22:10.487
You're, you're really tiny.

01:22:10.558 --> 01:22:12.025
And I should have known
you were an alien,

01:22:12.093 --> 01:22:14.084
because no straight man
is that good a dancer.

01:22:14.162 --> 01:22:18.997
I think I'm finally able to understand
how your painting makes me feel.

01:22:21.670 --> 01:22:23.137
I feel love.

01:22:27.542 --> 01:22:31.273
- Okay, I guess she's not that fat.
- Told you.

01:22:33.815 --> 01:22:36.682
Hey! Hey, man!
Hey, don't forget about me!

01:22:37.452 --> 01:22:40.080
Yeah! I'm not trying to stay in here!

01:22:41.423 --> 01:22:42.822
You squeezing my brain!

01:22:42.891 --> 01:22:46.224
- You're gonna make it pop! Stop!
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

01:22:46.294 --> 01:22:48.387
Hey, slow down.
I don't want you messing up my sexy.

01:22:48.463 --> 01:22:51.864
Okay. Easy.
Almost, almost, almost, almost.

01:22:52.567 --> 01:22:53.591
Okay.

01:22:57.772 --> 01:23:01.731
Hey! Yeah. Yeah, that, that look good.

01:23:04.379 --> 01:23:06.370
Time for us to go home.

01:23:07.816 --> 01:23:10.512
- I'll miss you, Dave.
- And I you.

01:23:11.319 --> 01:23:14.811
Remember, I'll never be that far away,

01:23:16.658 --> 01:23:18.091
good friend.

01:23:28.837 --> 01:23:30.737
A little room, please.

01:23:50.992 --> 01:23:52.357
What? No!

01:23:59.200 --> 01:24:00.497
Dave!

01:24:08.143 --> 01:24:09.906
- FBI!
- Out of the way!

01:24:09.978 --> 01:24:11.536
Move, move, move!

01:24:11.613 --> 01:24:13.843
- No!
- Hey, what is going on?

01:24:29.064 --> 01:24:30.554
Mom, look!

01:24:36.271 --> 01:24:37.761
He's okay.

01:24:54.456 --> 01:24:56.219
I didn't think we'd make it out of there.

01:24:56.291 --> 01:24:59.158
Good thing you have
such big feet, Captain.

01:25:00.261 --> 01:25:02.752
We'll have much to explain
when we return home.

01:25:02.831 --> 01:25:05.391
We'll find another way to save Nil.

01:25:05.467 --> 01:25:07.492
There are plenty of worlds out there
for us to explore.

01:25:07.569 --> 01:25:09.230
Yes, No. 3.

01:25:09.304 --> 01:25:10.566
But what we learned on Earth

01:25:10.638 --> 01:25:13.630
is more valuable
than all the salt in the galaxy.

01:25:13.708 --> 01:25:18.077
And when we do return,
it looks like I'll be needing a new No. 2.

01:25:18.146 --> 01:25:21.013
I think you'll be needing more than that.

01:25:25.120 --> 01:25:28.007
Yeah, Captain!
Get in there, Captain!

01:25:49.077 --> 01:25:50.601
Cue the new anthem.

01:28:50.602 --> 01:28:51.603
