WEBVTT

00:01.302 --> 00:02.770
You know,
the first stock exchange

00:02.903 --> 00:05.306
started in Belgium, 1531,

00:05.439 --> 00:07.508
and for the next
five centuries,

00:07.641 --> 00:10.344
this flow of capital
transformed the world

00:10.478 --> 00:11.612
more than politics,

00:11.745 --> 00:13.647
religion, war.

00:13.781 --> 00:18.018
And like all markets,
ours depends on rules.

00:18.152 --> 00:21.289
The honest reporting
of profit and loss.

00:21.422 --> 00:23.824
You failed to do that.
You, uh...

00:23.957 --> 00:27.027
You lied
on your disclosure forms.

00:27.161 --> 00:32.366
You raised $78 million
to build a tunnel
under the border

00:32.500 --> 00:35.035
that you never
intended to build.

00:35.169 --> 00:39.039
Five miles of road and rail,
flatbeds, pallets, people,

00:39.173 --> 00:41.375
with entrances and exits

00:41.509 --> 00:44.712
located at warehouses
that you control.

00:44.845 --> 00:50.484
Instead,
you invested the money
in Miami real estate.

00:50.618 --> 00:52.653
Now, on Wall Street,
this kind of Ponzi scheme

00:52.786 --> 00:54.822
would get you a slap
on the wrist

00:54.955 --> 00:56.657
and a Central Park co-op.

00:56.790 --> 00:58.259
Your investors, however,

00:58.392 --> 01:01.562
the often
unscrupulous people
you ripped off...

01:01.695 --> 01:03.063
I think you see where
I'm going with this.

01:03.197 --> 01:04.998
It's nowhere good.

01:05.133 --> 01:07.335
They're very emotional people,
and right now,

01:07.468 --> 01:11.038
their emotions are tending
towards usury and murder.

01:11.172 --> 01:12.706
Luckily for you,

01:12.840 --> 01:14.875
we have rules
that we've all
agreed to follow.

01:15.008 --> 01:16.144
To wit.

01:16.277 --> 01:18.146
You know, I have no idea
what "to wit" means.

01:18.279 --> 01:19.713
I just love the way
that it sounds.

01:19.847 --> 01:22.015
Let's see.

01:22.150 --> 01:25.253
Section 42,
subparagraph C.

01:25.386 --> 01:26.387
Punishments.

01:26.520 --> 01:28.722
To wit.

01:28.856 --> 01:31.459
Punishments are for
the Chairman to decide.

01:31.592 --> 01:34.828
Now, your investors
want you dead.

01:34.962 --> 01:36.864
I'm thinking
more walking dead.

01:36.997 --> 01:38.432
Living, breathing examples

01:38.566 --> 01:39.600
of what happens

01:39.733 --> 01:41.569
when you break our rules.

01:41.702 --> 01:44.538
These are the consent forms
you each signed,

01:44.672 --> 01:47.741
consenting to abide
by my decision.

01:47.875 --> 01:49.443
And my decision is this.

01:49.577 --> 01:52.346
Repayment in full, plus 20%.

01:53.347 --> 01:54.415
And fingers.

01:54.548 --> 01:56.650
Two from you.
Two from you.

01:56.784 --> 01:57.951
Three from you.

01:58.085 --> 02:00.754
From the hand you used
to sign your consent form.

02:00.888 --> 02:02.723
You see,
this is a blood oath.

02:02.856 --> 02:06.260
You broke it, so I get a piece
of what you broke it with.

02:06.394 --> 02:09.530
Beth, you're the ringleader.
Lead the ring.

02:09.663 --> 02:11.565
No. No, please
don't do this.

02:11.699 --> 02:13.934
Too late for that.
No. Oh!

02:19.707 --> 02:22.710
Uh, Joe, that's,
uh, three from Beth.

02:22.843 --> 02:25.413
Just, uh, work backwards
from the pinkie.
No. No, please.

02:25.546 --> 02:29.917
Oh, and, uh, Beth,
feel free to tell anybody
who asks...

02:30.050 --> 02:33.254
If they're gonna cheat,
cheat the stock market,

02:33.387 --> 02:34.888
not the night market.

02:35.022 --> 02:36.790
No.

02:36.924 --> 02:39.092
No.

02:47.835 --> 02:49.937
You know, MPD has
nothing on the bartender.

02:50.070 --> 02:51.972
After a month.
It's like it never happened.

02:52.105 --> 02:53.374
Well, he was hit
by a pro.

02:53.507 --> 02:56.344
Finding a clue trail's
gonna take some time.

02:56.477 --> 02:58.412
I don't have time.

02:58.546 --> 03:00.448
What I have is some voicebox
who keeps calling

03:00.581 --> 03:01.949
to remind me
he's got a gun to my head.

03:02.082 --> 03:03.517
Yeah, well,
the next time he calls,

03:03.651 --> 03:05.018
you'll be able
to record his voice,

03:05.152 --> 03:07.120
and we'll see if we can't
unscramble the voicebox

03:07.255 --> 03:08.121
and get an ID.

03:09.089 --> 03:10.358
What the hell
are you looking for?

03:10.491 --> 03:12.560
Mimi's missing.
A stuffed bunny.

03:12.693 --> 03:14.862
Yea big. Charred feet.

03:14.995 --> 03:17.197
A bunny?
With charred feet?

03:17.331 --> 03:18.799
It's Agnes'
transitional object.

03:18.932 --> 03:20.834
At her age, isn't that
called a smartphone?

03:20.968 --> 03:22.570
It belonged
to her mother.

03:22.703 --> 03:24.405
It played a key role
in the breakup
of the Soviet Union.

03:24.538 --> 03:26.540
The bunny did?

03:26.674 --> 03:28.008
Thank you, by the way,
for the phone

03:28.141 --> 03:29.910
and for reviewing
the case file again.

03:30.043 --> 03:31.545
Yeah, well,
I've reviewed it
three times.

03:31.679 --> 03:33.481
Then thanks
for reviewing it a fourth.

03:33.614 --> 03:35.483
We have to find out
what happened
to the bartender,

03:35.616 --> 03:36.717
and if the cops can't help us,

03:36.850 --> 03:38.185
we have to help ourselves.

03:38.319 --> 03:39.453
Hm.

03:39.587 --> 03:41.655
"Nick's Pizza."

03:41.789 --> 03:43.924
Maybe they have
the bunny.

03:48.195 --> 03:49.663
Harold.

03:49.797 --> 03:50.831
Please.

03:53.066 --> 03:53.967
Reading your future?

03:56.136 --> 03:56.937
I don't know.

03:58.339 --> 04:00.007
Mierce.

04:00.140 --> 04:03.377
For me,
it's just...calming.

04:04.512 --> 04:06.714
Is this about Elizabeth?

04:06.847 --> 04:09.216
Her body needs
to be exhumed, Harold.

04:09.350 --> 04:11.251
Aram told me
about the tracker.

04:11.385 --> 04:15.589
That whomever wanted her dead
put it in her, not on her.

04:15.723 --> 04:17.858
And yet you posted guards
at her grave.

04:17.991 --> 04:19.059
She's resting in peace.

04:19.192 --> 04:20.594
I intend on
keeping it that way.

04:24.097 --> 04:25.833
Much of my world

04:25.966 --> 04:29.903
exists right
alongside yours.

04:30.037 --> 04:33.574
People and organizations
in our two worlds

04:33.707 --> 04:35.476
have the same needs.

04:35.609 --> 04:37.411
Security. Medical care.

04:37.545 --> 04:38.479
Air travel.

04:38.612 --> 04:40.247
Corporate infrastructure.

04:40.381 --> 04:42.416
Financial services.

04:42.550 --> 04:44.918
Hence the night market,

04:45.052 --> 04:47.087
a stock market for criminals.

04:47.220 --> 04:49.723
The Sinaloa Cartel
issues stocks?

04:49.857 --> 04:52.360
Cartels, gangs,
crime syndicates.

04:52.493 --> 04:55.295
The Yakuza is no different
than Google.

04:55.429 --> 04:57.365
They both issue stock
to raise money

04:57.498 --> 05:00.601
to pay for R&D,
capital expenses,

05:00.734 --> 05:02.836
to expand
their operations.

05:02.970 --> 05:04.538
Are you in the market?
Of course.

05:04.672 --> 05:06.440
Capital markets are the key

05:06.574 --> 05:09.743
to explosive growth
in your world.

05:09.877 --> 05:11.945
The night market
is no different in mine.

05:12.079 --> 05:13.781
I'd be a fool not to
take advantage of it.

05:13.914 --> 05:15.449
But you want us
to bring it down.

05:15.583 --> 05:17.951
The man in charge is known
as the Chairman.

05:18.085 --> 05:19.720
I don't know
his real name

05:19.853 --> 05:21.455
or where exactly
to find him.

05:21.589 --> 05:23.323
He moves around a lot.

05:23.457 --> 05:24.825
What I do know

05:24.958 --> 05:27.661
is that he
is a one-man SEC.

05:27.795 --> 05:30.130
Judge, jury,
and executioner.

05:30.263 --> 05:32.132
These unfortunates

05:32.265 --> 05:35.302
misled their investors
in advance of an IPO.

05:35.436 --> 05:36.269
The Chairman did this?

05:36.404 --> 05:37.771
To send a message.

05:37.905 --> 05:39.339
Quite literally.

05:39.473 --> 05:43.276
They take a photo
and disseminate it
to the community.

05:45.245 --> 05:46.947
You're wrong
about Elizabeth.

05:47.080 --> 05:49.850
She's not resting
nor in peace.

05:49.983 --> 05:51.619
She's dead.

05:51.752 --> 05:55.288
She can't be disturbed
because she doesn't exist.

05:55.423 --> 05:57.024
We exist.

05:57.157 --> 05:58.291
We hurt.

05:58.426 --> 06:00.894
We are in pain.

06:01.028 --> 06:03.664
And we need answers.

06:03.797 --> 06:04.798
<i>What you're looking at</i>

06:04.932 --> 06:06.934
is a black market
stock market.

06:07.067 --> 06:11.004
The night market is made up
of hundreds of companies
raising billions in capital.

06:11.138 --> 06:13.541
But what companies?
What do the initials
stand for?

06:13.674 --> 06:16.410
According to Reddington,
they're a code that he
doesn't have the key to.

06:16.544 --> 06:18.111
Well, if this is
an online trading platform,

06:18.245 --> 06:19.346
why don't we
just pull the plug?

06:19.480 --> 06:20.848
Because
the night market
is hosted

06:20.981 --> 06:22.983
on a decentralized
blockchain network,

06:23.116 --> 06:25.953
meaning it runs across
10,000 nodes
all over the world.

06:26.086 --> 06:27.888
Even if we could find one
and shut it down,

06:28.021 --> 06:31.191
the other 9,999
would keep humming.

06:31.324 --> 06:34.828
We'd basically have
to disconnect the entire
Internet to stop it.

06:34.962 --> 06:37.030
The only company Reddington
could identify is this one.

06:37.164 --> 06:40.000
BKRC stands for
Banda Korce.

06:40.133 --> 06:41.334
Albanian.

06:41.469 --> 06:43.904
Specializing in extortion
and money laundering.

06:44.037 --> 06:45.573
Casinos are their
drug of choice.

06:45.706 --> 06:47.775
A fact that
Gaming Enforcement
got wind of.

06:47.908 --> 06:50.678
They opened up
an investigation
into Tremont Casinos.

06:50.811 --> 06:53.380
That's the legitimate company
that BKRC muscled in on.

06:53.514 --> 06:55.549
And as a result,
Tremont's stock
on Wall Street

06:55.683 --> 06:57.851
went down 30%,
and yet...

06:57.985 --> 07:00.754
On the night market,
BKRC's up 25%.

07:00.888 --> 07:02.022
How's that possible?

07:02.155 --> 07:03.891
The investigation
by Gaming Enforcement

07:04.024 --> 07:05.559
should be bad
for both companies.

07:05.693 --> 07:08.061
Markets price
in information.

07:08.195 --> 07:11.231
If BKRC's stock is going up,
that means the criminal market

07:11.364 --> 07:13.433
knows something that
the legitimate one doesn't.

07:13.567 --> 07:15.769
Like that?
They're gonna be able
to stop the investigation?

07:15.903 --> 07:17.037
The night market
is run by a man

07:17.170 --> 07:19.272
who does this
to people who cross him.

07:19.406 --> 07:21.074
He's known as
the Chairman.

07:21.208 --> 07:23.276
The only way to bring down
the market is to get to him.

07:23.410 --> 07:26.313
Maybe the way to do that
is to get to BKRC first.

07:26.446 --> 07:29.416
Dembe, Park,
go to Gaming Enforcement,
see what they know.

07:32.586 --> 07:35.255
Did Reddington say
anything about the guards
posted at the cemetery?

07:35.388 --> 07:37.591
He did. And he wasn't
happy about it.

07:37.725 --> 07:39.760
His concern is our need
for closure,

07:39.893 --> 07:42.229
not hers for peace
and tranquility.

07:42.362 --> 07:43.797
His need or ours?

07:43.931 --> 07:46.266
If what you're asking is
do the guards stay,

07:46.399 --> 07:47.701
the answer's yes.

07:47.835 --> 07:49.469
Great.
Thank you.

07:49.603 --> 07:51.705
Look, I want answers
as much as Reddington,

07:51.839 --> 07:53.907
but not at the expense
of disturbing Liz's remains.

07:56.977 --> 07:58.646
Tremont's stock
is in a nose dive

07:58.779 --> 08:01.248
because our investigation
is rock solid.

08:01.381 --> 08:04.051
We know they're in business
with Banda Korce,

08:04.184 --> 08:06.854
that Banda Korce
is run by Driton Abazi,

08:06.987 --> 08:08.922
and that he is using Tremont's
casinos to launder money.

08:09.056 --> 08:10.257
What's your timeline?

08:10.390 --> 08:12.325
When do you plan
on arresting Abazi?

08:12.459 --> 08:14.294
He's smart. Insulated.

08:14.427 --> 08:16.129
But we finally got someone
on the inside.

08:16.263 --> 08:18.331
Your inside source,
what's his name?

08:18.465 --> 08:21.101
If we tell you
and you approach him,
he might run scared,

08:21.234 --> 08:22.836
and everything we've
worked on could be lost.

08:22.970 --> 08:24.304
We want to make sure
he's okay.

08:24.437 --> 08:26.840
Why wouldn't he be?
What aren't you telling us?

08:26.974 --> 08:29.109
It's conventional wisdom
in the criminal world

08:29.242 --> 08:31.344
that your investigation
is going nowhere.

08:31.478 --> 08:33.246
Since it rests
on this source,

08:33.380 --> 08:35.949
it stands to reason
that his life may be
in danger.

08:39.620 --> 08:40.821
It's not a he.

08:41.555 --> 08:43.023
It's a she.

08:43.156 --> 08:45.525
And we have no case
without her.

08:51.699 --> 08:52.833
Thanks for the Dom, baby.

08:52.966 --> 08:54.501
Lorik just gave it to me,

08:54.635 --> 08:56.203
but he didn't tell me
what it was for.

08:56.336 --> 08:58.105
<i>It's a going-away
present.</i>

08:58.238 --> 08:59.873
I like the sound of that.
Where are we going?

09:00.007 --> 09:00.974
<i>A toast.</i>

09:01.709 --> 09:02.810
<i>To stupidity.</i>

09:03.677 --> 09:04.678
That's a dumb toast.

09:04.812 --> 09:07.514
<i>Well, we are
dumb people.</i>

09:07.648 --> 09:09.516
<i>I'm stupid for thinking
that you loved me,</i>

09:09.650 --> 09:11.551
<i>and you're stupid
for thinking</i>

09:11.685 --> 09:13.386
<i>I wouldn't find out
what you did.</i>

09:13.520 --> 09:15.589
What are you
talking about?

09:15.723 --> 09:17.891
<i>Don't talk. Drink.</i>

09:18.025 --> 09:19.893
<i>If you have enough
before he gets there,</i>

09:20.027 --> 09:22.329
<i>it might not
hurt as much.</i>

09:22.462 --> 09:24.164
If this is a joke,
it's not funny.

09:24.297 --> 09:25.599
<i>It's not a joke.</i>

09:25.733 --> 09:27.534
<i>It's a going-away
present.</i>

09:27.668 --> 09:29.302
Okay, I don't understand.
Where are we going?

09:29.436 --> 09:31.371
<i>We are not
going anywhere.</i>

09:31.504 --> 09:32.505
<i>You are.</i>

09:32.640 --> 09:35.008
<i>To a very painful place.</i>

09:35.142 --> 09:37.377
<i>The champagne may numb it.
That's it.</i>

09:37.510 --> 09:40.080
<i>My present.
To numb the pain.</i>

09:40.213 --> 09:41.782
Oh, it's the classic
love story.

09:41.915 --> 09:44.852
Boy meets girl,
girl betrays boy,

09:44.985 --> 09:47.220
boy has psychopath
dismember girl.

09:47.354 --> 09:49.623
It's so cliched,
it's almost boring.

09:49.757 --> 09:51.224
I didn't betray anybody.

09:51.358 --> 09:53.593
That would be hard
to prove.

09:53.727 --> 09:56.396
Gaming Enforcement encrypts
all of its files.

09:56.529 --> 10:00.033
Unfortunately, someone forgot
to firewall the copy machine.

10:03.536 --> 10:05.538
You don't believe him,
right, baby?

10:05.673 --> 10:06.774
Look, please,
I didn't...

10:08.676 --> 10:11.544
You know, I love reading
quarterly reports,

10:11.679 --> 10:16.549
examining
financial disclosures,
regulating the market.

10:16.684 --> 10:19.052
The part of my job I detest
is enforcement.

10:19.186 --> 10:21.755
Lately, it seems like
all I do.

10:27.560 --> 10:28.796
Two years.

10:28.929 --> 10:31.431
We've spent two years
trying to turn Tsiona Stern.

10:31.564 --> 10:33.667
And then we show up
and she disappears.

10:33.801 --> 10:35.068
Mc<i>Disappears?
She's dead.</i>

10:35.202 --> 10:36.937
She didn't miss
a check-in, not one,

10:37.070 --> 10:39.072
until you started
asking around.

10:39.206 --> 10:41.775
Ms. Stern put her life at risk
to help expose Banda Korce.

10:41.909 --> 10:43.110
That was very brave.

10:43.243 --> 10:44.611
<i>And we can honor
that bravery</i>

10:44.745 --> 10:46.146
<i>by carrying on
with her work.</i>

10:46.279 --> 10:47.781
<i>You by going back
to your office,</i>

10:47.915 --> 10:49.282
reviewing your files,

10:49.416 --> 10:50.650
and seeing where the case
stands without her.

10:50.784 --> 10:53.086
We, by looking into
her murder.

10:53.220 --> 10:55.255
We can't do that
without names.

10:55.388 --> 10:57.257
<i>Family, friends.
Who was closest to her?</i>

10:58.391 --> 10:59.960
She had a sister.

11:00.093 --> 11:01.261
Ressler,
get a name and number.

11:01.394 --> 11:02.730
Take Dembe.
See what she knows.

11:06.967 --> 11:09.002
Did you find anything
on the bartender?

11:09.136 --> 11:11.471
Maybe yes, maybe no.

11:11.604 --> 11:14.808
The, uh, bartender was close
with a woman he worked with.

11:14.942 --> 11:16.376
Did the police
talk with her?

11:16.509 --> 11:18.245
Well, they tried,
but she wouldn't
return their calls.

11:18.378 --> 11:20.113
You know,
the cops got busy,
had other leads,

11:20.247 --> 11:22.149
and she fell
through the cracks.

11:22.282 --> 11:24.117
It turned out that she didn't
return their calls

11:24.251 --> 11:25.685
because she disappeared.

11:25.819 --> 11:27.520
She left her apartment
the day after the murder

11:27.654 --> 11:28.822
and hasn't
been seen since.

11:28.956 --> 11:30.690
Do you have a name?
I do.

11:30.824 --> 11:32.159
That's about all I have.

11:32.292 --> 11:34.694
Like I said,
may be a lead,
maybe not.

11:34.828 --> 11:40.300
Hey, uh, by the way,
did you ever find the bunny
that solved the Cold War?

11:40.433 --> 11:42.335
That's a hell
of a bedtime story.

11:42.469 --> 11:44.137
Mimi belonged
to Agnes' mother.

11:45.372 --> 11:48.942
Holding on to it
is like holding on to her.

11:49.076 --> 11:50.878
And, yeah,
it's a hell of a story.

11:51.011 --> 11:52.980
One I'm not sure
I should tell Agnes.

11:53.113 --> 11:54.848
Her mother's part in it
was complicated.

11:54.982 --> 11:56.349
Agnes deserves the truth,

11:56.483 --> 11:58.185
even the parts
that are complicated.

11:58.318 --> 12:01.354
So you think that extends
to how her mother died,

12:01.488 --> 12:04.124
which might be the most
complicated part of all?

12:04.257 --> 12:07.094
Yeah, well,
of all the parts of the story
that you have to tell,

12:07.227 --> 12:09.496
that's the
most important one.

12:09.629 --> 12:11.064
Without it,
she'll never get closure.

12:12.833 --> 12:14.434
Thanks, Lew.

12:14.567 --> 12:16.904
For the advice.
And for this.

12:17.037 --> 12:19.472
Mm. Yeah. Hey,
did voicebox
ever reach out?

12:19.606 --> 12:21.374
Not yet, but it's been
a few weeks,

12:21.508 --> 12:22.876
so it's only
a matter of time.

12:23.010 --> 12:24.711
Right.

12:26.880 --> 12:28.348
Hey. I'd like to meet.

12:29.749 --> 12:31.184
No.

12:31.318 --> 12:32.552
At the cemetery.

12:34.287 --> 12:35.889
I begged her
not to cooperate
with the cops.

12:37.825 --> 12:39.726
I told her just to get out.

12:39.860 --> 12:41.728
But she was
stuck on the guy.

12:41.862 --> 12:44.164
Well, if she cared for Abazi,
why'd she inform on him?

12:44.297 --> 12:46.433
It was volatile, passionate.

12:48.101 --> 12:49.937
Spite. Anger. Jealousy.

12:50.070 --> 12:51.905
The trifecta
of the scorned lover.

12:52.039 --> 12:53.406
So Abazi cheated on her.

12:53.540 --> 12:54.707
He's a thug.

12:54.842 --> 12:57.710
Hurting people,
skimming off casino profits.

12:57.845 --> 12:59.913
She might've gone
against him anyway,

13:00.047 --> 13:01.614
but Felicia sure helped.

13:01.748 --> 13:02.482
Felicia...

13:03.050 --> 13:04.417
Dawson.

13:04.551 --> 13:06.019
S-She's a dealer
he moved

13:06.153 --> 13:07.921
into one of the suites
at the casino.

13:08.055 --> 13:09.789
Tsiona followed him there,

13:09.923 --> 13:13.126
expecting to catch him
with Felicia, which she did,

13:13.260 --> 13:16.229
as well as finding him
having some kind of
business meeting.

13:18.298 --> 13:20.200
You want to bug a suite
at the casino?

13:20.333 --> 13:21.935
The informant's sister
says that's where Abazi

13:22.069 --> 13:23.570
conducted a lot
of his business.

13:23.703 --> 13:25.138
The suite's
rented in the name
of his girlfriend.

13:25.272 --> 13:27.774
His other girlfriend.

13:27.908 --> 13:29.042
A Felicia Dawson.

13:29.176 --> 13:30.643
Former casino employee.

13:30.777 --> 13:31.979
Divorced.
Five-year-old daughter.

13:32.112 --> 13:33.513
Who's now consorting
with criminals,

13:33.646 --> 13:35.315
which should be enough
for us to pull a warrant,

13:35.448 --> 13:36.850
hear what they
talk about.

13:36.984 --> 13:39.452
And hopefully hear enough from
Abazi to get to the Chairman.

13:39.586 --> 13:41.354
Getting a warrant
might not be the problem,

13:41.488 --> 13:43.090
but installing
the bug is.

13:43.223 --> 13:45.658
I do not envy the guy
who has to slip in and out

13:45.792 --> 13:47.327
of the love nest
of an Albanian mobster.

13:50.497 --> 13:51.631
Room service.

13:51.764 --> 13:52.966
Hands out.

13:53.100 --> 13:54.834
I'm not doing it.
<i>Doing what?</i>

13:54.968 --> 13:56.203
<i>I'm asking you
to meet some people.</i>

13:56.336 --> 13:58.538
I know what you're
asking me to do,

13:58.671 --> 14:00.273
and the answer is no.

14:00.407 --> 14:01.274
<i>Call me back
when you're alone.</i>

14:04.677 --> 14:06.013
What are you looking at?

14:06.146 --> 14:07.414
Oh. Uh, nothing.

14:07.547 --> 14:09.282
I will just
put things out.

14:10.417 --> 14:11.651
Very good.

14:31.638 --> 14:34.007
Oh. Hello.

14:34.141 --> 14:36.043
I'm guessing the hot dog
is for you.

14:36.176 --> 14:37.310
You wanna eat it
down here?

14:38.311 --> 14:39.279
Okay.

14:39.412 --> 14:42.315
One hot dog coming up.

14:42.449 --> 14:44.184
There you go. <i>Voila.</i>

14:45.185 --> 14:47.520
What's wrong?
Parents fighting?

14:47.654 --> 14:49.189
They're not my parents.

14:49.322 --> 14:50.490
He's not.

14:50.623 --> 14:51.891
What's that?

14:52.025 --> 14:53.826
I saw you put it there.

14:53.961 --> 14:58.498
That? Oh, um, that's part
of a magic trick.

14:58.631 --> 15:01.868
And if it's done right,
Mr. Abazi will disappear.

15:02.002 --> 15:03.703
People can't disappear.

15:03.836 --> 15:05.305
Not normally, no.

15:05.438 --> 15:08.508
But, uh, this...
This is a very special trick.

15:08.641 --> 15:10.910
But for it to work,
you can't tell anyone.

15:11.044 --> 15:12.345
Not even your mom.

15:13.180 --> 15:14.547
Think you can do that?

15:14.681 --> 15:17.050
But if he goes,
will he ever come back?

15:17.184 --> 15:19.019
Of course not.

15:19.152 --> 15:20.220
It's magic.

15:23.856 --> 15:25.858
Agnes is doing well.

15:25.993 --> 15:28.861
At school, she's getting
mostly A's.

15:30.030 --> 15:31.965
A B+ in math.

15:32.099 --> 15:33.233
She doesn't really like math.

15:34.567 --> 15:35.768
Neither do I.

15:37.337 --> 15:38.805
She's got lots of friends.

15:40.540 --> 15:42.342
At the moment,
her biggest concern

15:42.475 --> 15:44.444
is that we have
misplaced Mimi.

15:44.577 --> 15:46.213
I'm sure she'll turn up,

15:46.346 --> 15:49.282
but for now, the house
is being turned upside down.

15:53.453 --> 15:56.223
When my father died,

15:56.356 --> 15:58.391
I kept a little
painting of his.

16:00.427 --> 16:04.197
He always wished
he'd been a real painter.

16:04.331 --> 16:06.599
But at least
there was the one.

16:06.733 --> 16:09.136
He took
terrible care of it,

16:09.269 --> 16:10.903
so it's faded and torn.

16:12.439 --> 16:13.873
But it reminded me of him,

16:16.443 --> 16:18.078
so I kept it
in the bathroom.

16:18.211 --> 16:20.413
Every morning,
he and I would have
a little chat.

16:25.318 --> 16:27.320
Why do we do that,
talk to the dead?

16:28.855 --> 16:30.423
They're gone.
Why do we talk to them?

16:34.894 --> 16:35.795
But they're not gone.

16:37.597 --> 16:39.599
As long as we're here,
they're here with us.

16:42.269 --> 16:43.103
Where are the guards?

16:44.071 --> 16:45.538
I dismissed them.

16:45.672 --> 16:47.440
If Elizabeth
is watching over us,

16:49.576 --> 16:51.511
I think she'd want Agnes
to know the truth,

16:51.644 --> 16:54.514
at least as much of it
as we can give her.

16:57.917 --> 16:58.651
Thank you.

16:59.452 --> 17:00.453
I'll get a court order.

17:02.189 --> 17:04.824
If we're gonna do this,
we're gonna do it
the right way.

17:15.868 --> 17:17.337
Hello, Elizabeth.

17:26.213 --> 17:27.247
Where did you find it?

17:27.380 --> 17:28.681
It was
under the seat.

17:28.815 --> 17:31.218
Agnes fell asleep on the way
back from the opera.

17:31.351 --> 17:32.319
She must've dropped it.

17:32.452 --> 17:33.486
I've been
looking everywhere.

17:33.620 --> 17:35.388
You have no idea
what a relief this is.

17:35.522 --> 17:36.856
Of course I do.

17:36.989 --> 17:38.725
Elizabeth couldn't sleep.

17:38.858 --> 17:40.160
Colicky.

17:40.293 --> 17:41.861
But more often than not,

17:41.994 --> 17:44.497
when she scrunched that bunny
against her cheek,

17:44.631 --> 17:49.402
she was calm, quiet.

17:49.536 --> 17:51.304
You should've taken her
to the opera.

17:51.438 --> 17:53.005
That'll put anyone
to sleep.

18:02.682 --> 18:05.218
Harold, please instruct
the medical examiner

18:05.352 --> 18:08.521
to be as respectful
as possible.

18:11.391 --> 18:14.026
Why? Because I'm terrified
for my daughter.

18:14.994 --> 18:16.796
Yes, names, dates.

18:18.231 --> 18:19.966
That's fine.
Roger's Park, 3:00.

18:23.570 --> 18:25.705
The meeting's set
with King and McVay.

18:25.838 --> 18:27.106
<i>You did good.</i>

18:27.240 --> 18:29.075
<i>Even I believed
you betrayed me.</i>

18:29.209 --> 18:31.444
When I was there, I heard
Abazi and Felicia arguing.

18:31.578 --> 18:32.879
This could be why.

18:33.012 --> 18:34.947
He's using her to set up
King and McVay.

18:35.081 --> 18:36.283
<i>This is how
it's gonna go.</i>

18:36.416 --> 18:37.617
<i>Lorik drives.</i>

18:37.750 --> 18:40.187
<i>You get out,
enter the park.</i>

18:40.320 --> 18:42.755
<i>When they approach,
you drop your sunglasses,</i>

18:42.889 --> 18:44.090
<i>bend down to pick them up.</i>

18:44.224 --> 18:45.925
<i>Lorik does the rest.</i>

18:46.058 --> 18:47.560
Meaning he kills them.

18:47.694 --> 18:49.095
<i>Meaning that
whatever it is,</i>

18:49.229 --> 18:51.097
<i>you don't have to
worry about it.</i>

18:51.231 --> 18:53.032
All right,
Dembe and I
will go to the park.

18:53.166 --> 18:54.934
You let King and McVay know
they're walking into a trap.

18:57.704 --> 18:59.572
Does Abazi actually think
killing the two people

18:59.706 --> 19:01.508
investigating him
will stop the investigation?

19:01.641 --> 19:03.910
He's not thinking.
He's reacting.

19:04.043 --> 19:05.578
Like a cornered animal
lashing out.

19:07.880 --> 19:09.382
<i>Mommy!</i>

19:09.516 --> 19:11.484
<i>Mommy's gonna go
run an errand.</i>

19:11.618 --> 19:13.786
Driton's coming over
to be with you
while I'm gone, okay?

19:16.989 --> 19:18.358
<i>Don't worry, kid.</i>

19:18.491 --> 19:19.592
<i>We'll have a good time.</i>

19:23.530 --> 19:25.432
Please make him disappear.

19:25.565 --> 19:27.234
Please make him disappear.

19:27.367 --> 19:29.168
<i>Please make him disappear.</i>

19:31.103 --> 19:33.340
Oh, sir, sir,
about, uh, Driton Abazi...

19:33.473 --> 19:34.874
Not now, okay?

19:35.007 --> 19:36.609
Is everything all right?
I'm sure it will be.

19:36.743 --> 19:39.412
It's just...
The exhumation.

19:39.546 --> 19:40.513
I ordered it.

19:42.315 --> 19:43.850
<i>Pursuant to an order issued</i>

19:43.983 --> 19:45.885
by Superior Court Judge
Victoria Shapiro,

19:46.018 --> 19:47.620
we are conducting
an exhumation autopsy

19:47.754 --> 19:49.222
on Elizabeth Keen.

19:49.356 --> 19:50.990
The purpose of the autopsy
is to determine

19:51.123 --> 19:52.992
whether Agent Keen
ingested a tracking device

19:53.125 --> 19:54.694
which remains
inside her postmortem.

19:56.296 --> 19:58.097
All right.
Thank you.

19:58.231 --> 20:00.767
Where are we
on King and McVay?
That was their supervisor.

20:00.900 --> 20:03.636
They're not picking up
his calls or mine.
I'm not surprised.

20:03.770 --> 20:05.338
After what happened
to their last informant,

20:05.472 --> 20:06.906
they don't trust anybody,
especially us.

20:07.039 --> 20:08.741
Okay.

20:08.875 --> 20:11.811
All right. This could be
the agents arriving.

20:21.554 --> 20:23.690
Here comes King and McVay.

20:23.823 --> 20:25.825
I'll keep eyes
on the driver.

20:25.958 --> 20:27.660
Thanks for coming.

20:27.794 --> 20:29.996
We want to start by saying
we will protect you.

20:30.129 --> 20:33.065
I wish you could,
but you can't
even protect yourselves.

20:36.969 --> 20:37.704
It's a hit.

20:41.207 --> 20:42.809
FBI! Stand back!

20:42.942 --> 20:44.711
Are you all right?
Get away from the car!

20:47.814 --> 20:50.583
Donald Ressler, FBI.
You need to come with us.

20:50.717 --> 20:52.084
No, I can't.
My daughter...

20:52.218 --> 20:54.287
We know about
your daughter.
Is she all right?

20:54.421 --> 20:56.155
She will be.
If you come with us, now.

21:00.460 --> 21:02.995
<i>It's done.
But Lorik was shot.</i>

21:03.129 --> 21:05.231
I don't know.
One of the agents, I think,

21:05.365 --> 21:06.799
before they were killed.

21:08.668 --> 21:10.036
I-I don't know.
It all happened so fast.

21:10.169 --> 21:11.771
I just...

21:11.904 --> 21:14.707
Baby, I'm scared.

21:14.841 --> 21:17.544
I need you
to come and get me.

21:17.677 --> 21:19.178
And I need you
to bring Lily.

21:21.213 --> 21:22.214
Okay.

21:23.783 --> 21:25.418
Yeah, yeah.
I know where that is.

21:26.919 --> 21:28.120
Okay.

21:28.921 --> 21:29.756
He's coming for me.

21:33.025 --> 21:35.127
But you can't do anything
until I have my daughter.

21:35.261 --> 21:37.597
Where did Abazi
tell you to meet?

21:46.839 --> 21:48.575
Hi, baby!
Mommy!

21:50.577 --> 21:51.811
I did what you
asked me to do.

21:53.813 --> 21:55.515
What else would I do?
You had Lily.

21:58.385 --> 22:00.052
Driton, please.

22:04.290 --> 22:05.091
You're okay.

22:05.224 --> 22:06.325
Mm!

22:11.398 --> 22:12.832
FBI! Hands!
Hands!

22:14.100 --> 22:15.668
FBI!
You're under arrest.

22:15.802 --> 22:16.836
Hands!
Let's see 'em!

22:16.969 --> 22:18.004
Turn around.

22:20.106 --> 22:23.009
And clear.
Everyone, stand down.

22:28.280 --> 22:29.215
Told you
he'd disappear.

22:30.817 --> 22:32.151
Good job.

22:36.656 --> 22:38.791
I'll update Cooper
on Abazi's arrest.

22:38.925 --> 22:40.292
Has he talked to you
about Elizabeth yet?

22:40.427 --> 22:42.161
No. Why?
What about her?

22:43.530 --> 22:45.164
The ME
found the tracker.

22:45.297 --> 22:46.766
<i>I'll get there
as soon as we can.</i>

22:46.899 --> 22:48.334
We should discuss
what comes next.

22:50.069 --> 22:52.204
Is it true about Liz?

22:52.338 --> 22:55.174
That you pulled the guards?
That you dug her up?

22:55.307 --> 22:58.344
I know you feel, but I decided
it was the right thing to do.

22:58.478 --> 22:59.479
You decided?

23:00.046 --> 23:01.213
Yes.

23:01.347 --> 23:03.282
Reddington
put you up to this.

23:03.416 --> 23:05.852
They found the tracker.
All you did was
desecrate her grave.

23:10.122 --> 23:12.592
Elizabeth would've
wanted us to do this.

23:12.725 --> 23:14.894
She would want us
to know who's responsible
for her death.

23:16.763 --> 23:19.331
You wanna know
who's responsible
for killing her?

23:19.466 --> 23:20.299
It was Reddington.

23:55.367 --> 23:56.569
Contact Pilken.

23:56.703 --> 23:58.237
Tell him we're done
with Abazi,

23:58.370 --> 24:00.206
have him delist Banda Korce.

24:00.339 --> 24:01.373
The stockholders
won't be happy.

24:01.508 --> 24:02.775
We have rules.

24:02.909 --> 24:04.777
When a company
is in legal trouble,

24:04.911 --> 24:06.846
they're sacrificed
to protect the market.

24:06.979 --> 24:08.414
I want you
to clean the place.

24:08.548 --> 24:09.782
Collect every flash drive,

24:09.916 --> 24:11.450
every file,
every Post-it Note.

24:11.584 --> 24:13.753
If it so much as mentions
the night market,

24:13.886 --> 24:15.822
I want it destroyed.

24:15.955 --> 24:17.289
What about Abazi?
Will he talk?

24:17.423 --> 24:19.425
Oh, he's seen how
we deal with informants.

24:19.559 --> 24:20.893
He won't say a word.

24:23.830 --> 24:25.865
He won't talk.
Did he lawyer up?

24:25.998 --> 24:27.667
No. He's terrified
of the Chairman.

24:27.800 --> 24:30.236
We said we'd protect him.
He laughed.

24:30.369 --> 24:32.471
What about Felicia?
I think
she would cooperate

24:32.605 --> 24:34.073
if it meant protecting
her daughter.

24:34.206 --> 24:36.075
But I don't think
she knows anything.

24:38.578 --> 24:41.213
So we're nowhere on connecting
Abazi to the night market.

24:57.897 --> 25:00.499
Oh, hey. Uh, so I,
uh, I've been looking
into the tracker.

25:00.633 --> 25:03.502
And I-I don't suppose
you're interested
in an update.

25:03.636 --> 25:04.436
You supposed right.

25:07.974 --> 25:09.942
It is incredibly cool.

25:10.076 --> 25:13.112
I mean, uh, well, not the way
it was used, of course,

25:13.245 --> 25:15.281
but big picture,
this thing is insane.

25:15.414 --> 25:18.117
It has a power supply
and a microprocessor

25:18.250 --> 25:20.687
that is only activated
to transmit data

25:20.820 --> 25:25.091
when it comes into
contact with the target's
digestive enzymes.

25:25.224 --> 25:27.326
I must say, I've, uh,
had my fill of analyzing

25:27.459 --> 25:29.161
the contents
of people's stomachs
of late.

25:29.295 --> 25:31.163
Oh, that's understandable.

25:31.297 --> 25:33.499
Is there a signature
of any kind,

25:33.633 --> 25:36.969
something to identify
where it was made
or by whom?

25:37.103 --> 25:39.038
I don't know yet. Maybe.
I need to keep looking.

25:39.171 --> 25:40.472
Then that's what
I want you to do.

25:40.607 --> 25:41.974
There can't be
that many people
in the world

25:42.108 --> 25:43.710
capable of making
something this advanced.

25:43.843 --> 25:45.311
I'm confident
we'll find him,

25:45.444 --> 25:47.580
more confident than I am
that we'll find the Chairman.

25:47.714 --> 25:48.715
Abazi won't talk.

25:48.848 --> 25:50.516
Of course not.

25:50.650 --> 25:52.384
But you don't
really need him to.

25:52.518 --> 25:54.621
He's our connection
to the Chairman.

25:54.754 --> 25:56.522
A connection we can't make
unless he talks.

25:56.656 --> 25:58.324
So just say
that he talked.

25:58.457 --> 26:00.192
Tell the world

26:00.326 --> 26:02.328
that you've been investigating
the night market

26:02.461 --> 26:05.097
and are preparing
to shut it down.

26:05.231 --> 26:06.198
None of which is true.

26:06.332 --> 26:07.800
Well, what is true, Harold,

26:07.934 --> 26:10.002
is that rumor
can drive the market.

26:10.136 --> 26:12.404
That's why Banda Korce's
stock went up,

26:12.538 --> 26:16.008
on the rumor that they'd found
the government informant.

26:16.142 --> 26:18.577
You want to flush out
the Chairman?

26:18.711 --> 26:22.915
Spread the rumor that Abazi
sang like a canary.

26:23.049 --> 26:25.351
Which no one can contradict
because he's in custody.

26:25.484 --> 26:27.854
You want me to lie
through my teeth
at a press conference?

26:27.987 --> 26:30.723
I want you to apply
situational ethics.

26:30.857 --> 26:33.960
Which I find to be
immensely enjoyable

26:34.093 --> 26:36.062
and ruthlessly effective.

26:36.195 --> 26:39.031
And would make for
a fantastic board game.

26:42.068 --> 26:45.037
We got everything.
Notebooks. Tablets.

26:45.171 --> 26:46.405
There's nothing left
that can hurt us.

26:46.538 --> 26:47.273
Yeah, it's me.

26:48.107 --> 26:49.408
We need a circuit breaker.

26:49.541 --> 26:51.243
Level Three.

26:51.377 --> 26:54.681
Yes, now. Before the market
drops another 20%.

26:54.814 --> 26:56.582
What's going on?

26:56.716 --> 26:58.050
That's what I'm trying
to find out.

27:00.753 --> 27:02.889
<i>Mr. Abazi is wanted
in connection</i>

27:03.022 --> 27:04.657
<i>with extortion
and money laundering.</i>

27:04.791 --> 27:07.894
<i>His company also trades
on a criminal stock market</i>

27:08.027 --> 27:09.662
<i>known as the night market.</i>

27:09.796 --> 27:12.064
<i>Mr. Abazi has agreed
to cooperate fully.</i>

27:13.199 --> 27:14.901
Call a meeting.
All the board members.

27:15.034 --> 27:16.035
I can't believe
he talked.

27:16.168 --> 27:17.970
Because he didn't.
It's a trick.

27:18.104 --> 27:19.772
I need to make sure
nobody else falls for it.

27:21.974 --> 27:23.075
<i>Chum's in the water.</i>

27:23.209 --> 27:25.577
Our shark won't be able
to resist.

27:25.712 --> 27:27.747
I hope you're right.
<i>Take the win, Harold.</i>

27:27.880 --> 27:29.581
You did well.

27:40.793 --> 27:41.994
<i>Andrew Kennison.</i>

27:43.629 --> 27:44.831
I don't know who that is.

27:44.964 --> 27:45.998
<i>I need him to go away.</i>

27:46.132 --> 27:48.167
"Go away"?
<i>Disappear.</i>

27:48.300 --> 27:49.836
<i>New identity.
New life.</i>

27:49.969 --> 27:52.038
Why?
<i>Because I said so.</i>

27:59.946 --> 28:02.348
Yes. Lew,
I'm glad you got a lead,

28:02.481 --> 28:04.116
but the bartender's friend's
gonna have to wait.

28:04.250 --> 28:07.286
He called with a demand.
I can't talk about it now.

28:07.419 --> 28:08.187
Just get here
as soon as you can.

28:09.989 --> 28:12.058
Any word from Ressler?
No.

28:12.191 --> 28:14.126
I reached out to him,
but he didn't answer.

28:14.260 --> 28:16.462
I'm worried about him.
He's upset.

28:16.595 --> 28:17.864
Understandable.
But he'll be fine.

28:17.997 --> 28:19.098
Sir, your bluff worked.

28:19.231 --> 28:21.300
Check it out.
It is a huge sell-off.

28:21.433 --> 28:23.335
The rumor you spread
about Abazi

28:23.469 --> 28:25.537
telling us about
the night market
spooked investors.

28:25.671 --> 28:27.807
The market was down 20%
before trading was halted.

28:27.940 --> 28:29.776
Hang on.
Can you stop it?

28:29.909 --> 28:31.710
Every other stock is down
except that one.

28:31.844 --> 28:33.145
An interesting anomaly,

28:33.279 --> 28:34.446
but I don't see
how one company

28:34.580 --> 28:36.382
bucking the market
is relevant to our case.

28:36.515 --> 28:39.318
Maybe not,
but that is a company
I wish I could invest in.

28:39.451 --> 28:40.887
In a way you do.

28:41.020 --> 28:44.223
COC stands for
Concierge of Crime.

28:44.356 --> 28:46.793
Reddington.
It's his company.

28:46.926 --> 28:48.961
You told your investors
it was a bluff.

28:49.095 --> 28:50.062
That's why
your stock's going up

28:50.196 --> 28:52.098
and everybody else's
is tanking.

28:52.231 --> 28:53.699
You traded on
insider information.

28:53.833 --> 28:54.934
I didn't.

28:55.067 --> 28:57.203
But not on principle,
mind you.

28:57.336 --> 28:59.071
I'd do it if it were
in my interest,

28:59.205 --> 29:00.606
<i>but in this case,
it's not.</i>

29:00.739 --> 29:02.341
You didn't bring us this case
to take down the night market.

29:02.474 --> 29:04.143
You brought it us to drive up
your share price.

29:04.276 --> 29:06.745
Actually, I was aiming
for bankruptcy.

29:06.879 --> 29:08.948
And all the freedom
that that implies.

29:09.081 --> 29:10.682
You know what?
Between the exhumation

29:10.817 --> 29:12.284
and other things
I'm dealing with,

29:12.418 --> 29:13.953
I don't have the bandwidth
for your nonsense.

29:14.086 --> 29:15.721
<i>Other things? Do tell.</i>

29:15.855 --> 29:17.824
Why? You never do.

29:17.957 --> 29:19.758
Harold, the market
is teetering,

29:19.892 --> 29:22.728
but it will recover,
unless you move
on the Chairman.

29:22.862 --> 29:25.164
<i>Thanks to your bluff,
I know how you can do that.</i>

29:26.065 --> 29:27.800
How?
<i>He's called a meeting.</i>

29:27.934 --> 29:29.735
<i>I'm on my way to it now.</i>
Where?

29:29.869 --> 29:31.737
I'll tell you,
but first,

29:31.871 --> 29:34.841
you'll have to give me time
to say my piece and go.

29:36.742 --> 29:38.144
<i>Some of you
are new to the market.</i>

29:38.277 --> 29:39.979
Others have been listed
for years.

29:40.112 --> 29:43.315
But this is the first time
any of us have met in person.

29:43.449 --> 29:45.251
That should
give you an idea

29:45.384 --> 29:47.954
of how important
I feel this meeting is.

29:48.087 --> 29:53.092
Now, together,
your companies represent
15% of our market cap.

29:53.225 --> 29:55.794
What you do matters.

29:55.928 --> 29:58.230
You panic, others panic.

29:58.364 --> 30:01.233
If you don't,
we can weather
any storm.

30:01.367 --> 30:02.634
Yeah, but can we
weather the FBI?

30:02.768 --> 30:05.137
Well, if they have something
on us, maybe not.

30:05.271 --> 30:06.305
But they don't.

30:06.438 --> 30:08.607
Abazi didn't talk.

30:08.740 --> 30:10.642
Now, the FBI
said that he did

30:10.776 --> 30:13.645
because they want
to scare investors,
get them to panic.

30:13.779 --> 30:16.748
If they could hurt us,
they would, but they can't.

30:16.883 --> 30:19.385
So they started a rumor
hoping we'll hurt ourselves,

30:19.518 --> 30:21.420
and that is exactly
what we're doing.

30:22.121 --> 30:23.722
$25 million.

30:23.856 --> 30:26.592
I'll put that
in the market by close
of business tomorrow,

30:26.725 --> 30:31.263
a leadership investment
to calm some obviously
frayed nerves.

30:31.397 --> 30:33.332
Mr. Reddington.
Thank you.

30:33.465 --> 30:35.001
See, that's exactly
what we need.

30:35.134 --> 30:37.269
Send a signal
to the other investors

30:37.403 --> 30:40.406
that the FBI
is all sizzle, no steak.

30:40.539 --> 30:42.808
I do have one condition.
Which is?

30:42.942 --> 30:45.444
The name
of the lead investor
in my company.

30:45.577 --> 30:47.279
Well, I'm afraid
I can't do that.

30:49.581 --> 30:51.017
$30 million.

30:51.150 --> 30:53.619
Mr. Reddington,
I talked about privacy.

30:53.752 --> 30:54.753
We have rules.

30:54.887 --> 30:55.821
Bend them.

30:55.955 --> 30:58.490
35. Give me a number.

30:58.624 --> 31:00.792
You must have one.
But I don't.

31:00.927 --> 31:02.995
You're willing
to risk the market

31:03.129 --> 31:06.298
to protect the identity
of a single investor?

31:06.432 --> 31:08.134
I designed
the market interface

31:08.267 --> 31:10.302
to protect
against this kind of bribe,

31:10.436 --> 31:11.803
or was that a threat?

31:11.938 --> 31:15.074
I anticipated the need
to keep men like you

31:15.207 --> 31:17.076
from hanging me
off the side of a building

31:17.209 --> 31:20.346
every time they felt cheated
by a short sale.

31:20.479 --> 31:23.882
So I made sure the identity
of each and every investor

31:24.016 --> 31:27.053
was shielded,
even from me.

31:27.186 --> 31:29.855
Well, I'm sure you all
have more to discuss,

31:29.989 --> 31:31.490
but I've said what
I came to say

31:31.623 --> 31:32.891
and heard what
I care to hear.

31:33.025 --> 31:34.693
So please excuse me.

31:42.434 --> 31:44.170
Andrew Kennison.
Who is he?

31:44.303 --> 31:45.904
An MIT grad student.

31:46.038 --> 31:48.440
What his connection
is to any of this,
I have no idea.

31:48.574 --> 31:50.509
And voicebox
wants him disappeared.

31:50.642 --> 31:52.144
A new ID.
A new life.

31:52.278 --> 31:54.346
Okay. So that's
what you do.

31:54.480 --> 31:56.648
Kidnap a grad student?
Buy time.

31:56.782 --> 31:58.750
Keep voicebox happy
until we've had a chance

31:58.884 --> 32:00.052
to talk to
the bartender's friend.

32:00.186 --> 32:01.287
I've got a line on her.

32:01.420 --> 32:03.055
I know that she headed
down south.

32:03.189 --> 32:05.391
Maybe she could tell us
who put him up to doping you,

32:05.524 --> 32:06.658
which would prove
your innocence.

32:10.462 --> 32:11.663
Not a good time.

32:11.797 --> 32:14.967
Then I'll be brief.
3726 Sheridan Road.

32:15.101 --> 32:16.535
They have backup.
So come heavy.

32:19.038 --> 32:20.906
What can we tell Kennison to
convince him to come with me?

32:21.040 --> 32:23.775
My vote, the truth.

32:23.909 --> 32:27.113
I need to speak with my team,
give them an assignment.

32:27.246 --> 32:29.181
Then I'll pay
Mr. Kennison a visit.

32:30.782 --> 32:32.784
So, yes,
while a leveraged buyback

32:32.918 --> 32:35.087
will increase the debit
on your balance sheet,

32:35.221 --> 32:36.255
we have a number
of offshore...

32:36.388 --> 32:37.789
FBI! Hands!

32:37.923 --> 32:39.358
Hands!
Hands!

32:46.932 --> 32:49.135
MAN 2: All right, all right.

32:49.268 --> 32:50.569
Abazi did talk.

32:50.702 --> 32:53.105
Sang like a bird.
And the melody...

32:54.073 --> 32:55.407
...it was all about you.

33:01.713 --> 33:03.749
Yeah.

33:05.651 --> 33:06.952
Andrew Kennison.

33:07.086 --> 33:08.420
Harold Cooper, FBI.

33:09.255 --> 33:11.223
Whoa. What's this about?

33:11.357 --> 33:13.592
We have reason to believe
your life is in danger.

33:13.725 --> 33:16.795
An agent with the Bureau
has been compromised.

33:16.928 --> 33:18.997
He's being blackmailed,
and for some reason,

33:19.131 --> 33:20.966
the blackmailer wants him
to abduct you.

33:21.100 --> 33:22.768
That's insane. Why?

33:22.901 --> 33:24.470
I was hoping
you could tell me.

33:24.603 --> 33:26.338
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

33:26.472 --> 33:27.773
It this
some kind of joke?

33:27.906 --> 33:29.408
I can assure you,
this is deadly serious.

33:29.541 --> 33:30.609
I've contacted
the Marshal Service.

33:30.742 --> 33:32.444
They're prepared to move you
somewhere safe

33:32.578 --> 33:33.712
until the danger's passed.

33:33.845 --> 33:36.014
Move... Move me?
Move me where?

33:36.148 --> 33:37.449
I'll explain it all
in the car.

33:40.386 --> 33:43.021
The codes.
How do you decrypt them?

33:43.155 --> 33:44.523
We have rules.

33:44.656 --> 33:46.024
I don't break them.

33:49.995 --> 33:52.231
Name the companies that trade
on the night market

33:52.364 --> 33:53.799
and you can
help yourself.

33:53.932 --> 33:55.534
Perhaps save yourself.

33:55.667 --> 33:57.303
I'm here
because you lied.

33:57.436 --> 33:58.870
Now you want me
to break my word?

33:59.004 --> 34:00.706
And you're the good guys?

34:00.839 --> 34:03.041
You created a market
that channeled billions
into criminal enterprises.

34:03.175 --> 34:06.178
Enron. Tyco.
AIG. Freddie Mac.

34:06.312 --> 34:08.680
Who channeled billions
to them?

34:08.814 --> 34:11.183
Have you arrested anyone
on Wall Street

34:11.317 --> 34:13.285
who financed
their crimes?

34:13.419 --> 34:16.021
Hey, how about
credit default swaps?

34:16.155 --> 34:17.356
Sub-prime lending.

34:17.489 --> 34:19.425
In 2008, those markets

34:19.558 --> 34:21.160
crashed the world economy,

34:21.293 --> 34:23.395
wiped out over $10 trillion

34:23.529 --> 34:24.830
worth of wealth,

34:24.963 --> 34:28.200
cost 8 million people
their jobs.

34:28.334 --> 34:29.768
Did you arrest anyone
for that?

34:29.901 --> 34:30.869
Oh, yeah.

34:31.570 --> 34:32.771
One guy.

34:34.440 --> 34:35.507
One.

34:37.176 --> 34:38.810
I may lose my freedom.

34:38.944 --> 34:40.379
But if it's
all the same to you...

34:42.214 --> 34:43.549
...I'll keep my integrity.

34:46.285 --> 34:47.919
Harold,
come in. Have a seat.

34:51.223 --> 34:52.090
Can I get you anything?

34:52.224 --> 34:53.392
No, I'm fine.

34:58.930 --> 35:03.302
After Elizabeth died, I...

35:06.037 --> 35:07.739
...let things go.

35:07.873 --> 35:08.874
Lot of things.

35:09.007 --> 35:10.409
People, businesses,

35:10.542 --> 35:13.345
trade routes,
landing rights.

35:13.479 --> 35:14.546
Streams of income.

35:16.248 --> 35:20.352
When I came back,
I was illiquid.

35:20.486 --> 35:24.089
So I incorporated
and sold stock
on the night market

35:24.223 --> 35:25.657
and got what I needed.

35:25.791 --> 35:28.126
And something I didn't.

35:28.260 --> 35:29.328
Greenmail.

35:29.461 --> 35:31.129
A hostile takeover.

35:31.263 --> 35:32.798
By whom, I don't know.

35:32.931 --> 35:35.667
But someone courted
my shareholders in secret

35:35.801 --> 35:39.137
and bought a controlling
interest in my...

35:41.207 --> 35:42.408
Company.

35:42.541 --> 35:44.476
That's why you wanted
to drive down the share price.

35:44.610 --> 35:46.312
To force them out. Yes.

35:46.445 --> 35:48.547
But they refused
to sell.

35:48.680 --> 35:50.449
Whoever it is
has a stranglehold on me

35:50.582 --> 35:51.717
and they won't let go.

35:51.850 --> 35:54.486
That's what you wanted
from the Chairman... A name.

35:56.822 --> 35:59.157
The tracking device.
Where are we on it?

35:59.291 --> 36:00.859
According to Aram,

36:00.992 --> 36:03.161
there's nothing
in DARPA's files
or the NSF.

36:03.295 --> 36:05.664
He's still looking,
but we haven't traced it
to anyone yet.

36:07.566 --> 36:08.600
You think
they're connected.

36:09.201 --> 36:10.769
Maybe.

36:10.902 --> 36:13.239
Or had someone
give it to her.

36:15.807 --> 36:17.776
Does it work?
To calm you down.

36:17.909 --> 36:20.612
And if so, can you teach me
how to do it?

36:21.713 --> 36:23.682
The "other things"
you're dealing with.

36:29.688 --> 36:30.656
I'm down a path.

36:32.491 --> 36:37.028
It's dark and taking me
to places I don't want to go.

36:37.162 --> 36:38.129
I wanna turn back,

36:40.566 --> 36:41.633
but I don't know how.

36:43.735 --> 36:46.004
I was born
to a dark path.

36:46.137 --> 36:47.138
It's the only path
I know.

36:48.907 --> 36:52.143
I've learned how to
recognize light
when I see it.

36:52.278 --> 36:55.314
To stop and stare.

36:56.648 --> 36:57.649
I reach for it.

36:58.717 --> 36:59.885
In the hope that it'll...

37:01.520 --> 37:02.688
Shed its light on me.

37:04.956 --> 37:06.825
And every once in a while,

37:06.958 --> 37:10.796
I'm able to bask
in its warmth
for a moment

37:10.929 --> 37:12.163
before...

37:14.199 --> 37:15.734
...moving on
in the dark.

37:20.472 --> 37:21.673
That's my life.

37:28.380 --> 37:29.448
Don't make it yours.

37:30.716 --> 37:33.452
Go home
to your wife and kid.

37:44.796 --> 37:46.264
Hey.

37:48.166 --> 37:49.200
Hey.

37:49.335 --> 37:50.369
You okay?

37:51.870 --> 37:53.204
I'm told they're
bringing her back.

37:53.839 --> 37:54.706
Are you okay?

37:56.241 --> 37:58.477
I didn't fall off the wagon,
if that's what you're asking.

38:00.346 --> 38:01.613
I thought about it.

38:02.848 --> 38:05.283
These last few weeks,
I felt so good.

38:06.618 --> 38:07.619
But this...

38:09.455 --> 38:11.590
I'm not gonna lie.
This was a real gut punch.

38:12.458 --> 38:14.426
Of course it was.

38:14.560 --> 38:17.629
But you need to find a way
to take life's punches
without slipping.

38:19.865 --> 38:21.099
And we're here
to help you do that.

38:22.668 --> 38:23.802
We?

38:23.935 --> 38:25.070
I was worried.

38:25.203 --> 38:27.205
I didn't know
where you'd gone,
so I told them.

38:27.339 --> 38:28.640
Told them what?

38:28.774 --> 38:29.741
Everything.

38:29.875 --> 38:31.443
Back to the pee test.

38:31.577 --> 38:33.278
I get it if you're mad,

38:33.412 --> 38:35.947
but they care for you
and wanna help.

38:36.748 --> 38:38.149
It's all good.

38:38.283 --> 38:39.818
None of us are perfect.

38:39.951 --> 38:42.153
Look, I appreciate
what you're doing,

38:42.287 --> 38:44.089
but we're not
in the same boat.

38:44.222 --> 38:47.559
Okay, I walked away
from a multimillion-dollar
start-up,

38:47.693 --> 38:49.395
after blowing
my life savings

38:49.528 --> 38:52.998
and the life savings
of one of my closest
friend's parents.

38:53.131 --> 38:56.001
I lied to my husband
about being a field agent.

38:56.134 --> 38:58.169
You also lied about
being a paid assassin.

38:59.605 --> 39:01.306
He offered blind loyalty

39:01.440 --> 39:03.274
to the most wanted fugitive
in the world.

39:04.843 --> 39:06.144
I wake up
in strange rooms.

39:07.178 --> 39:09.481
Naked.
Covered in vomit.

39:11.249 --> 39:13.351
You're right. That's a...
That's a different boat.

39:14.520 --> 39:15.854
It's a different ocean.

39:15.987 --> 39:16.855
Which is why
we're here.

39:20.626 --> 39:22.360
You can't
slay demons alone.

39:22.494 --> 39:23.495
None of us can.

39:32.203 --> 39:33.805
Look, if you don't want
to do this for us,

39:34.940 --> 39:36.341
then let us do it
for her.

39:45.517 --> 39:47.486
It's what she'd
expect us to do.

40:04.169 --> 40:05.236
Look who I found.

40:05.370 --> 40:06.271
Meems!

40:10.041 --> 40:11.009
Where was she?

40:11.142 --> 40:12.243
In Pinky's car.

40:12.377 --> 40:13.679
You left her there
after the opera.

40:21.152 --> 40:23.689
You know you can
ask me anything...

40:25.123 --> 40:28.159
About your mom,
your grandparents.

40:28.293 --> 40:31.863
Whatever questions you have,
I'll tell you what I know.

40:33.499 --> 40:34.466
Okay.

40:36.401 --> 40:37.302
About Mimi, too.

40:38.336 --> 40:39.571
Mimi?

40:39.705 --> 40:41.139
She's a very
special bunny.

40:42.407 --> 40:43.775
You see this scar?

40:43.909 --> 40:45.811
She got it after
your grandfather

40:45.944 --> 40:47.813
hid a flash drive
inside of her

40:47.946 --> 40:49.948
that contained
a very important secret.

40:51.983 --> 40:53.084
What kind of secret?

40:53.218 --> 40:56.087
A secret that changed
the course of world history.

40:56.221 --> 40:57.923
The entire world
is the way it is

40:58.056 --> 41:00.125
because of a secret
hidden inside that bunny.

41:02.027 --> 41:02.961
By my grandfather?

41:03.929 --> 41:04.896
Yes.

41:05.764 --> 41:06.898
Raymond Reddington.

41:07.566 --> 41:09.735
That's Pinky's name.

41:09.868 --> 41:12.170
Yes, well,
it's a long story.

41:13.605 --> 41:14.606
But it's my story.

41:16.207 --> 41:17.108
Yes, I guess it is.

41:17.976 --> 41:19.110
Tell it.

41:25.016 --> 41:27.418
Once upon a time,

41:27.553 --> 41:29.988
a woman named Katarina
met a man named Raymond.

41:31.623 --> 41:33.424
<i>One was Russian,</i>

41:33.559 --> 41:34.926
<i>one was American.</i>

41:35.961 --> 41:38.463

41:38.597 --> 41:40.498
<i>and on each other,</i>

41:40.632 --> 41:41.933
<i>and they didn't agree
