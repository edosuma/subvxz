WEBVTT

00:04.405 --> 00:06.674
Are you kidding me
with this rain?

00:08.309 --> 00:09.810
I know you're not gonna
believe this.

00:09.877 --> 00:11.879
On my lengthy walk
from the parking lot,

00:11.945 --> 00:14.582
I was accosted
by a sea lion.

00:15.849 --> 00:19.420
Are you sure it wasn't
just a wet dog?

00:19.487 --> 00:21.855
I haven't been this wet
since I was pulled up onstage

00:21.922 --> 00:23.724
at that
Luther Vandross concert.

00:25.793 --> 00:27.361
What?
Somebody hit the fire alarm.

00:27.428 --> 00:28.529
I was soaked
by the sprinkler.

00:29.863 --> 00:31.865
Yay, yay!
Where my healers at?

00:32.766 --> 00:34.102
How are you so dry?

00:34.168 --> 00:36.504
Pat moved me
to the indoor valet lot,

00:36.570 --> 00:40.074
so finally I can take full
advantage of suede season.

00:41.475 --> 00:42.643
Aw!

00:42.710 --> 00:44.044
Forgot to leave my keys
with the guy.

00:44.112 --> 00:45.413
Hey, check this out...

00:45.479 --> 00:47.148
Car's so close you can hear it
from here.

00:47.215 --> 00:49.817
(CAR ALARM CHIRPS)
(LAUGHS)

00:49.883 --> 00:53.020
Lock, unlock.
Lock, unlock.
(CHUCKLES)

00:53.087 --> 00:54.355
Panic!
(HORN BLARING)

00:54.422 --> 00:56.657
Kidding.

00:56.724 --> 00:58.058
All right,
let's get to it.

00:58.126 --> 01:00.060
Hey, Damona, have you had
a chance to read the schedule?

01:00.128 --> 01:03.364
Hey, Ken, have you had
a chance to read the room?

01:04.565 --> 01:06.100
Mm.
Not getting anything.

01:07.301 --> 01:08.769
We're all drenched,

01:08.836 --> 01:11.004
and you stroll in here
bragging about your
new valet spot

01:11.071 --> 01:12.973
and your fancy jacket,
Mr. Suede.

01:13.040 --> 01:14.708
Oh, this jacket's
not Mr. Suede.

01:14.775 --> 01:16.410
It's Dwayne's suede
by Dwayne Wade

01:16.477 --> 01:18.146
for Sherman Oaks
coat factory.

01:19.113 --> 01:21.382
PAT: Good morning, everybody.

01:21.449 --> 01:24.452
Oh, and, Ken,
happy suede season.

01:24.518 --> 01:26.987
And to you, sir.

01:27.054 --> 01:28.122
Whoop!
Whoop!

01:28.189 --> 01:29.290
Ah!

01:29.357 --> 01:30.624
(BOTH LAUGH)

01:30.691 --> 01:31.859
Dwayne's suede?

01:31.925 --> 01:33.261
No, Ace of suedes.
Ah!

01:34.061 --> 01:35.596
Anyhoo,

01:35.663 --> 01:37.331
good news, bad news...

01:37.398 --> 01:38.532
Is something I wish
I was able to say,

01:38.599 --> 01:40.501
but I only have bad news.

01:40.568 --> 01:41.735
To increase productivity,

01:41.802 --> 01:43.003
you all have
to work Saturdays.

01:43.070 --> 01:44.672
What?
That is unacceptable.

01:44.738 --> 01:47.641
Saturdays are
college game day!

01:47.708 --> 01:49.710
It's the Jewish Sabbath!

01:49.777 --> 01:51.044
Not you, Ken.

01:51.111 --> 01:52.780
Senior doctors don't have
to work Saturday.

01:52.846 --> 01:54.815
You heard the man.
Rules is rules, people.

01:56.016 --> 01:57.551
Oh, hey.

01:57.618 --> 01:59.453
I actually don't mind.

01:59.520 --> 02:01.855
Sickness doesn't take
Saturdays off,
so why should we?

02:03.191 --> 02:05.926
What I meant was...

02:06.760 --> 02:09.663
(GROANS)
Why, Pat? Why?

02:13.301 --> 02:15.803
I'm gonna take the rest of the
day off to lounge on my yacht,

02:15.869 --> 02:18.806
the SS I have a yacht
and you don't.

02:21.242 --> 02:23.677
Whew!
That was close.

02:23.744 --> 02:26.880
I almost lost my Saturdays.
(CHUCKLES)

02:26.947 --> 02:29.149
My big natty "sattys."
(CHUCKLES)

02:29.217 --> 02:30.918
What happened to you,
little man?

02:30.984 --> 02:33.020
What?
You used to be one of us.

02:33.086 --> 02:35.423
When we first started here,
we would hang out together

02:35.489 --> 02:37.057
and complain about people
like Pat.

02:37.124 --> 02:39.827
Now we complain about people
like you.

02:41.229 --> 02:42.663
Seriously, Clark,
is that true?

02:42.730 --> 02:44.031
Oh. (STAMMERS)

02:44.097 --> 02:45.633
I don't participate
in that at all.

02:45.699 --> 02:49.603
Oh! So it wasn't you that
came up with the nickname

02:49.670 --> 02:52.606
"Dr. Ken, you believe
how out of touch I've become"?

02:54.508 --> 02:57.945
There's that dance
that goes with it.

02:58.011 --> 03:00.113
Guys, this is crazy.
Come on!

03:00.180 --> 03:03.484
I'm still the same Kenny
from the block.

03:03.551 --> 03:06.420
Excuse me, Mr. Ken.
You forgot to leave
your keys with me.

03:06.487 --> 03:09.022
I realized it when the car
kept locking,

03:09.089 --> 03:10.924
unlocking, locking,
unlocking,

03:10.991 --> 03:12.493
panic, no panic.

03:12.560 --> 03:13.794
Thank you, Juan-Julio.

03:13.861 --> 03:15.396
Of course, Mr. Ken.

03:15.463 --> 03:17.565
I parked it just the way you
like, across two spots.

03:17.631 --> 03:20.401
Okay, all right,
thank you.

03:20.468 --> 03:22.503
With traffic cones blocking
two additional spots.

03:22.570 --> 03:25.138
Okay, all right.
Very good.

03:25.205 --> 03:27.741
I'll go ahead
and get that glove
compartment reupholstered!

03:27.808 --> 03:28.942
Okay!

03:36.417 --> 03:37.985
I mean, they see me
as this out-of-touch jerk,

03:38.051 --> 03:39.387
but what am I
supposed to do,

03:39.453 --> 03:40.788
apologize that
I've worked hard

03:40.854 --> 03:42.290
and now I got
a decent parking spot

03:42.356 --> 03:43.891
and they're working
Saturdays?

03:45.058 --> 03:46.494
(SIGHS)

03:46.560 --> 03:49.162
Let me ask you a question.
Where do they park?

03:49.229 --> 03:52.600
Uh, you know, by the...

03:52.666 --> 03:57.305
I mean, I know it's outside
because there was a lot of
squawking about the rain.

03:57.371 --> 03:58.706
Where do you eat lunch?

03:58.772 --> 04:00.140
At the Executive Bistro.

04:00.207 --> 04:01.642
And where do they eat?

04:01.709 --> 04:03.176
Well, they used to eat
in the cafeteria,

04:03.243 --> 04:06.414
but now there's this whole
vermin situation.

04:06.480 --> 04:08.882
So now they eat
in their cars.

04:08.949 --> 04:10.784
So technically, I don't know
where they eat,

04:10.851 --> 04:13.053
because I don't know
where they park.

04:13.120 --> 04:16.123
Oh, my God,
I am an out-of-touch jerk.

04:16.189 --> 04:18.258
This is a pretty
solvable problem.

04:18.326 --> 04:19.827
Oh, thank God.

04:19.893 --> 04:22.563
Oh, so who do I hire
to solve it?

04:22.630 --> 04:25.032
Like, I got the money.
I'm a doc, oh, wow.

04:25.098 --> 04:27.468
I'm out of control.
Help me.

04:27.535 --> 04:29.870
Just go to bat for them.
Talk to Pat.

04:29.937 --> 04:31.772
See if you can get
their Saturdays back.

04:31.839 --> 04:33.807
Talking to Pat would mean
doing the thing
I hate doing the most...

04:33.874 --> 04:35.142
Talking to Pat.

04:36.610 --> 04:38.512
What up, my parents?

04:38.579 --> 04:41.181
Oh, glad you guys
are "A," off work

04:41.248 --> 04:44.852
before we get
home from school,
and "B," already drinking.

04:44.918 --> 04:47.521
"A," we don't have to explain
ourselves to you.

04:47.588 --> 04:49.523
And "B,"
you're the reason we drink.

04:51.859 --> 04:53.093
Right back at you.

04:53.160 --> 04:54.628
Excuse me?

04:54.695 --> 04:56.129
(LAUGHS)
Solid burn.

04:57.665 --> 04:59.900
Anyway, I thought you guys
would want to know

04:59.967 --> 05:02.436
that Dave has a new nickname
at school.

05:02.503 --> 05:03.571
Dave.

05:03.637 --> 05:05.506
No, Dave's just
my regular name.

05:07.375 --> 05:09.109
Say the nickname,
like we practiced.

05:09.176 --> 05:10.444
Klompers.

05:12.045 --> 05:13.681
Klompers?
What, what does
that even mean?

05:13.747 --> 05:14.848
I don't know.

05:14.915 --> 05:16.517
Which kids are calling
you Klompers?

05:16.584 --> 05:17.751
I don't know.

05:17.818 --> 05:18.852
Does it bother you?

05:18.919 --> 05:20.554
I don't know.

05:20.621 --> 05:22.155
Well, it bothers me.

05:22.222 --> 05:25.292
You know, for 80 bucks,
I can make it go away.

05:25.359 --> 05:26.827
It's a simple
four-point plan

05:26.894 --> 05:28.128
that involves
positive messaging,

05:28.195 --> 05:29.630
social media,
image consultation,

05:29.697 --> 05:31.965
and, if necessary,
a big kid named Hugo

05:32.032 --> 05:33.801
who will hurt anyone
for gummy worms.

05:35.903 --> 05:37.671
No!

05:37.738 --> 05:39.106
But here's exactly
what you do.

05:39.172 --> 05:41.409
You march up to whoever
is calling you Klompers

05:41.475 --> 05:43.176
and tell them,
"my name is Dave Park,

05:43.243 --> 05:45.012
"and that is what I'd like
to be called."

05:45.078 --> 05:46.179
Okay.

05:49.049 --> 05:51.619
Just an FYI.
The price goes up
after today.

05:52.753 --> 05:53.787
No!

05:55.055 --> 05:56.256
(SIGHS)

05:58.459 --> 06:00.327
He's got to learn to stand up
for himself.

06:00.394 --> 06:03.764
I agree, Al.
Your parenting game
is on fleek.

06:05.332 --> 06:07.367
He should absolutely not
take that nickname.

06:07.435 --> 06:10.003
Take the nickname, Dave.

06:10.070 --> 06:11.972
Take the nickname?
But you said...

06:12.039 --> 06:15.275
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
I say a lot of things in front
of your mother I don't mean.

06:15.342 --> 06:17.778
"I love it
when we garden."

06:17.845 --> 06:20.213
Or, "I would
never remarry."

06:21.715 --> 06:24.518
The point is, Klompers
is not a bad nickname.

06:24.585 --> 06:26.153
People are talking
about you.

06:26.219 --> 06:28.121
You're in the mix,
sweetheart.

06:28.188 --> 06:29.557
Okay, thanks, Dad.

06:29.623 --> 06:31.592
I didn't want to give
that speech anyway.

06:31.659 --> 06:34.361
Son, talking to people
about stuff sucks.

06:35.663 --> 06:37.097
Even this
was a little rough.

06:37.164 --> 06:38.899
I did not enjoy it.

06:43.270 --> 06:48.241
* Whoa, Dr. Ken
You Believe How
Out of touch I've become

06:48.308 --> 06:49.443
* Yeah

06:49.510 --> 06:50.644
* I Have No Regard

06:50.711 --> 06:53.180
* For The Lower Income

06:53.246 --> 06:54.648
* They Walk Through
The rain

06:54.715 --> 06:55.783
* Walk Through The Rain

06:55.849 --> 06:57.518
* I Make It Rain...
Whaa!

07:00.954 --> 07:02.823
All right,
I deserved that.

07:02.890 --> 07:05.893
Well, the idea of that,
not the ham-fisted
execution of it.

07:07.795 --> 07:09.262
Look,
I know you guys are upset.

07:09.329 --> 07:13.667
But I had an idea that was
my own and no one else's.

07:13.734 --> 07:15.335
I'm gonna talk to Pat
on your behalf.

07:15.402 --> 07:17.471
You sure that wasn't
Allison's idea?

07:17.538 --> 07:19.507
Yeah, it feels like you
needlessly got way out

07:19.573 --> 07:22.109
ahead of that by saying it was
"no one else's idea."

07:22.175 --> 07:23.611
It was my idea.

07:23.677 --> 07:25.178
Look, do you want your
Saturdays back or not?

07:25.245 --> 07:26.279
Hell, yeah.

07:26.346 --> 07:27.615
Oh, that's okay.

07:29.750 --> 07:31.084
Yes, please!

07:31.151 --> 07:32.553
I demand it!

07:34.121 --> 07:35.455
It's a great idea, boss.
Thank you.

07:35.523 --> 07:36.957
Don't thank me.
Thank Allison.

07:37.024 --> 07:38.258
Damn it!

07:42.162 --> 07:43.531
Pat, we need to talk.

07:43.597 --> 07:45.032
I know what
you're gonna say,

07:45.098 --> 07:46.634
and before you do, let me
tell you, I'm sorry,

07:46.700 --> 07:48.301
I'll give you anything
you want,

07:48.368 --> 07:50.437
and I love you.

07:52.640 --> 07:54.908
Thanks.
I love you too?

07:54.975 --> 07:57.578
What? Oh, no, sorry.
I'm on with my wife.

07:59.112 --> 08:00.280
What's up?

08:00.347 --> 08:01.582
Look,
I think it's a mistake

08:01.649 --> 08:03.116
to have the staff
work Saturdays.

08:03.183 --> 08:04.752
I hear you loud and clear.
Let's just forget it.

08:04.818 --> 08:05.986
Wow.
That was easy.

08:06.053 --> 08:07.955
Oh, no,
still on with my wife.

08:08.021 --> 08:09.456
No.
Saturdays are happening.

08:09.523 --> 08:11.692
Look, I get that it might
increase profits,

08:11.759 --> 08:13.727
but those are my people
out there. Hello?

08:13.794 --> 08:15.996
Okay, well, why don't you come
out on my yacht tonight,

08:16.063 --> 08:17.631
and we'll talk it out
over dinner?

08:17.698 --> 08:20.100
No chance.
That's literally the last
thing I'd ever want to do!

08:20.167 --> 08:21.735
Excuse me?
Sorry, my wife.

08:21.802 --> 08:22.803
Oh.

08:24.938 --> 08:28.942
She wants to binge-watch
How to Get Away with Murder
tonight, so...

08:29.009 --> 08:30.343
Permission to come aboard?

08:30.410 --> 08:31.612
Okay. Uh, 8:00?

08:31.679 --> 08:33.581
I've got plans.
You just said...

08:33.647 --> 08:35.583
Oh, your wife.
Right. Yeah.

08:35.649 --> 08:38.586
I'll send you the address,
and see you in hell.

08:38.652 --> 08:39.820
(CHUCKLES) Wife?

08:39.887 --> 08:41.321
No, I just thought
it sounded cool.

08:45.492 --> 08:47.194
Ooh!
So, how did it go?

08:47.260 --> 08:49.730
Good, great.
Working on it.

08:49.797 --> 08:52.232
Ken, will we know
before Saturday?

08:52.299 --> 08:54.201
If I don't cancel
my mall-walking group,

08:54.267 --> 08:57.004
those bastards charge me.

08:57.070 --> 09:01.208
And I was supposed to go
to the WNBA Draft.

09:01.274 --> 09:04.612
Hey, I will not rest
until I get this done
for you guys.

09:04.678 --> 09:07.615
Unless it bleeds
into tomorrow,
then I need to rest.

09:07.681 --> 09:09.216
If I don't get eight or nine
hours of sleep,

09:09.282 --> 09:11.118
I mean, ten is really
the sweet spot,

09:11.184 --> 09:14.354
but the point is,
I'm gonna do
whatever it takes.

09:14.421 --> 09:16.489
Oh, Ken.

09:16.556 --> 09:18.491
Bring a windbreaker tonight.
It gets a little nippy
out on the yacht.

09:22.495 --> 09:24.297
Hey, guys,
it's not like that.

09:24.364 --> 09:26.166
You know what I think
it's like?

09:26.967 --> 09:28.068
That.

09:37.410 --> 09:38.879
Hey, Allison.

09:38.946 --> 09:40.247
(DOOR CLOSES)

09:40.313 --> 09:41.849
Take the nickname?

09:44.417 --> 09:47.087
All right, but I'd love
to hear it first.

09:47.154 --> 09:49.422
I'm talking about the advice
you gave our son.

09:49.489 --> 09:50.658
Well, in my defense,

09:50.724 --> 09:53.560
Dave wasn't supposed to
tell you I said that.

09:53.627 --> 09:55.128
He didn't.
He told me.

09:55.195 --> 09:57.330
I told mom.
Why would you do that?

09:57.397 --> 09:58.866
I'm trying to keep this
a crisis,

09:58.932 --> 10:01.568
create demand for my
nickname-eradication skills.

10:03.136 --> 10:04.571
Okay.
No.

10:05.605 --> 10:07.307
Ugh. Your loss.

10:07.374 --> 10:09.509
If you need me,
I'll be hanging with
Klompers.

10:12.545 --> 10:16.583
Look, I know you're peeved,
vexed, cross even!

10:17.584 --> 10:19.019
I never should have put
that little book

10:19.086 --> 10:21.521
of old anger terms
in the powder room.

10:21.588 --> 10:22.856
I'm sorry I went
behind your back,

10:22.923 --> 10:24.725
but there are way worse
nicknames

10:24.792 --> 10:26.293
they could have
given Dave,

10:26.359 --> 10:28.829
like Glue Boy, from the time
he ate all that glue.

10:28.896 --> 10:31.799
Or Staple Boy, from the time
he ate all those staples.

10:31.865 --> 10:34.835
Or Sandwich Boy, because
he's afraid of sandwiches.

10:36.369 --> 10:38.605
Besides, Bae,
he's in the conversation.

10:38.672 --> 10:40.340
You know who that
conversation is with?

10:40.407 --> 10:42.142
His future therapist.

10:42.209 --> 10:44.978
I have a patient who was
nicknamed Julia Louis Doofus

10:45.045 --> 10:46.747
when she was a kid because
when she got nervous,

10:46.814 --> 10:48.348
she mispronounced
her own name.

10:48.415 --> 10:50.583
Okay, that's on her.
She choked in a social sitch.

10:52.652 --> 10:54.554
Besides,
Klompers is harmless.

10:54.621 --> 10:59.159
I mean, the kids are probably
all like, "yo, everyone.
It's Klompers!"

10:59.226 --> 11:02.830
Or they could be like,
"No, everyone, it's Klompers."

11:02.896 --> 11:07.100
Or it could be,
"Guess who's here?
It's Klompers!

11:08.836 --> 11:10.704
"And he brought cider?"

11:12.205 --> 11:13.807
Why is he
bringing cider?

11:13.874 --> 11:15.508
I don't know.
It's a harvest festival

11:15.575 --> 11:17.344
and everyone's happy
to see him?

11:19.312 --> 11:21.081
Look, Bae,
you're super smart,

11:21.148 --> 11:23.483
but sometimes you're
a little over-thinky.

11:23.550 --> 11:26.319
Trust me.
This is so not a big deal.

11:26.386 --> 11:28.756
Yeah, you may be right.

11:28.822 --> 11:30.323
I guess I should let
this one go.

11:30.390 --> 11:32.760
(CHUCKLES) There it is.
Now give me some sugar.

11:35.595 --> 11:38.531
Hey, Julia Louis Doofus
was you, wasn't it?

11:38.598 --> 11:40.300
(GROANS)
I used to get nervous!

11:46.139 --> 11:47.908
Hey, Pat, it's Ken.

11:47.975 --> 11:49.376
So I'm looking for your boat,

11:49.442 --> 11:52.212
but the old GPS here
has me a good

11:52.279 --> 11:54.848
30 miles from the nearest
body of water.

11:56.383 --> 11:57.885
PAT: Is that you
in the gray car?

11:57.951 --> 11:59.552
Oh, you're here!

11:59.619 --> 12:01.088
On your left.

12:02.489 --> 12:03.623
Ahoy!

12:08.328 --> 12:10.998
Oh, and that lamp,
believe it or not,

12:11.064 --> 12:12.565
is from the turn
of the century.

12:12.632 --> 12:14.167
The lava lamp?

12:14.234 --> 12:16.436
Yeah,
I bought that in 1999.

12:18.038 --> 12:20.240
All right, just under
the buzzer, yeah.

12:20.307 --> 12:21.875
This is great, man.

12:21.942 --> 12:24.444
This is way more
"not in the water"
than I expected.

12:25.846 --> 12:27.280
Anyway, about
this Saturday thing...

12:27.347 --> 12:29.817
Ken, my wife says
she no longer loves me.

12:30.951 --> 12:32.953
Wow.
Segue be damned.

12:33.020 --> 12:36.957
Yeah. Yeah, my little flower
says she wants a divorce.

12:37.024 --> 12:40.127
She's insisting I no longer
sleep in our marital bed.

12:40.193 --> 12:42.062
Which, funny story,

12:42.129 --> 12:44.197
is located
in our marital home,

12:45.098 --> 12:46.366
which funny story,

12:46.433 --> 12:48.335
is located just up
that driveway.

12:51.171 --> 12:52.705
Anyway,
about this Saturday thing...

12:52.772 --> 12:54.842
Why are you so concerned
about that?

12:54.908 --> 12:57.010
I mean, it only affects
the lowers.

12:57.077 --> 12:58.411
Not you and me.

12:58.478 --> 13:01.081
No, we're just two rich guys
on a yacht.

13:02.515 --> 13:05.452
Again, I got to throw
a flag on "yacht."

13:05.518 --> 13:07.720
And, you know what,
those people you call
"lowers,"

13:07.787 --> 13:09.456
I call them
"Friends with less money."

13:09.522 --> 13:11.825
Which isn't great,
but it sells what
I'm getting at.

13:11.892 --> 13:13.927
And I'm here to stand up
for them.

13:13.994 --> 13:16.864
All right, well, we're gonna
have to circle back to that.

13:16.930 --> 13:19.766
Ken, I asked you here because
I need medical attention.

13:19.833 --> 13:21.168
Why, what's wrong?

13:21.234 --> 13:23.370
Oh, nothing yet.
But in a moment,

13:23.436 --> 13:25.772
I'm gonna take
this nail gun

13:25.839 --> 13:28.175
and fire
a 2-inch framing nail...

13:28.241 --> 13:29.609
Into my pinkie toe.

13:30.477 --> 13:31.578
Oh!

13:31.644 --> 13:32.913
Crudite?

13:39.752 --> 13:41.754
Look, I've been to some
weird parties...

13:41.821 --> 13:44.291
Todd Lieberman's adult
circumcision luau
comes to mind,

13:46.459 --> 13:48.761
but this is by far
the weirdest.

13:50.363 --> 13:51.965
Look, Ken...

13:52.900 --> 13:55.202
See, over the course

13:55.268 --> 13:57.770
of my at times
turbulent marriage,

13:57.837 --> 14:01.008
Tiffany's come to view me
as cold and unsympathetic.

14:01.074 --> 14:02.609
No!

14:02.675 --> 14:03.810
You?

14:03.877 --> 14:05.412
It may sound crazy,

14:05.478 --> 14:07.614
but I know when I pump
this little piggy
full of hot metal...

14:07.680 --> 14:09.682
She'll know that you're
completely bananas?

14:09.749 --> 14:11.484
No, quite the opposite.

14:11.551 --> 14:13.020
No, whenever I was sick
or injured,

14:13.086 --> 14:15.755
Tiff would always shower me
with love and attention.

14:15.822 --> 14:17.590
Ah, our marriage
was never stronger

14:17.657 --> 14:19.927
than when I shattered
my coccyx breakdancing.

14:22.095 --> 14:24.197
Anyway, I think
I've got everything

14:24.264 --> 14:26.166
you're gonna need
to treat me.

14:26.233 --> 14:29.102
I've got gauze
and I've got sutures.

14:29.169 --> 14:31.804
Oh, and I even got
the creme brulee torch
out of our kitchen

14:31.871 --> 14:35.308
in case you have to cauterize
the wound.

14:35.375 --> 14:36.676
So, what do you say, Ken?

14:36.743 --> 14:39.446
No! What? No!
What is wrong with you?

14:39.512 --> 14:42.282
I'm not gonna do this!
I'm a doctor!

14:42.349 --> 14:45.652
Do you honestly think shooting
your own toe with a nail

14:45.718 --> 14:47.487
is gonna help win
your wife back?

14:47.554 --> 14:49.022
Well, of course not.

14:49.089 --> 14:50.490
I was gonna tell her
I was attacked

14:50.557 --> 14:52.059
by a drifter
with a milky eye.

14:54.027 --> 14:55.395
Or better,
I'll say you did it!

14:55.462 --> 14:58.198
No one would believe that.
Oh, really?

14:58.265 --> 15:00.100
Well, it would be your word
against mine,

15:00.167 --> 15:01.901
a respected
business and yachtsman.

15:01.969 --> 15:04.004
You're neither
of those things!

15:04.071 --> 15:06.106
Confronted by
a hot-tempered doctor

15:06.173 --> 15:08.575
who just found out he has
to work on Saturdays.

15:09.842 --> 15:11.878
Oh, okay.
So this is how it is?

15:11.945 --> 15:14.547
Yeah. So,
what's it gonna be, Ken?

15:18.818 --> 15:20.853
Can I use the bathroom?

15:20.920 --> 15:23.290
Oh, of course.
Yes. It's right in here.

15:25.125 --> 15:26.526
Do you mind?

15:26.593 --> 15:27.860
Oh! Yeah.

15:31.198 --> 15:32.932
(CELL PHONE RINGS)
Hi, Ken.

15:33.000 --> 15:34.534
Allison, I need...

15:34.601 --> 15:36.736
Hold on. The girl on
How to Get Away with Murder

15:36.803 --> 15:39.839
is about to possibly get away
with murder?

15:39.906 --> 15:41.774
Okay, she did.
What's up?

15:41.841 --> 15:43.343
Pat's gonna shoot a nail
through his toe

15:43.410 --> 15:44.611
to try to win
his wife back!

15:44.677 --> 15:45.979
What?
That's crazy.

15:46.046 --> 15:47.680
I know it's crazy.
What do I do?

15:47.747 --> 15:50.350
Okay, the most important thing
is to not leave him alone.

15:50.417 --> 15:51.784
(NAIL GUN FIRES)

15:53.720 --> 15:54.854
Hey!

15:56.256 --> 15:58.591
I was practicing
on these baby carrots.

15:58.658 --> 16:00.293
Oh, thank God.

16:00.360 --> 16:03.663
Okay, listen, Pat,
I don't like you.

16:04.264 --> 16:05.498
And?

16:05.565 --> 16:07.167
And I don't think
I'm ever gonna like you.

16:07.234 --> 16:08.401
But?

16:08.468 --> 16:09.836
But that's okay with me.

16:09.902 --> 16:11.171
Because?

16:11.238 --> 16:12.872
Because you're unlikable.

16:12.939 --> 16:15.842
However,
I can't let you do this.

16:15.908 --> 16:17.777
If you want to reboot
your relationship,

16:17.844 --> 16:20.180
it has to be on a foundation
of honesty,

16:20.247 --> 16:21.748
not injuring yourself

16:21.814 --> 16:24.584
in a pathetic
attempt to gain pity.

16:24.651 --> 16:26.119
You're better than that.

16:26.186 --> 16:27.920
Not by a lot...

16:28.821 --> 16:29.989
But you are.

16:30.057 --> 16:31.591
(SIGHS)

16:31.658 --> 16:33.126
I guess you're right, Ken.

16:33.193 --> 16:34.394
(SIGHS)

16:34.461 --> 16:36.363
But I love her so much,

16:36.429 --> 16:38.765
it just makes me want to do
crazy things, you know?

16:39.766 --> 16:41.434
I think I do.

16:43.670 --> 16:45.172
But I appreciate
your wisdom,

16:45.238 --> 16:46.873
and it won't soon
be forgotten.

16:47.707 --> 16:48.908
Thanks.

16:50.543 --> 16:53.046
Okay,
so now that governor Ken

16:53.113 --> 16:55.082
has given your little toe
a pardon,

16:55.148 --> 16:57.184
where are we on the whole
Saturday of it all?

16:57.250 --> 16:59.086
Oh, Ken-padre, please.

16:59.152 --> 17:01.154
Working Saturdays
is not gonna happen.

17:01.221 --> 17:02.322
Oh, thank God.

17:02.389 --> 17:04.357
Everyone's gonna be
so relieved and happy.

17:04.424 --> 17:06.659
Oh, no.
Saturdays are
very much happening

17:06.726 --> 17:08.795
for the great unwashed.

17:08.861 --> 17:11.598
Sorry.
Friends with less money.

17:14.101 --> 17:16.035
You leaving the yacht?
Not a yacht!

17:22.209 --> 17:23.910
So, in film class,

17:23.976 --> 17:25.412
we each got
assigned a different
Scarlett Johansson movie,

17:25.478 --> 17:27.314
and Madison wanted
to trade with me,
but I said no.

17:27.380 --> 17:29.182
It's like, I got
Lost in Translation.

17:29.249 --> 17:30.917
And she got Her...
period.

17:32.085 --> 17:33.486
Mom,
are you even listening?

17:33.553 --> 17:35.655
Yeah, yeah.
Madison got her period.

17:37.657 --> 17:39.092
See ya, Klompers!

17:39.159 --> 17:40.260
Bye!

17:40.327 --> 17:42.995
Hey, Klompers,
your shoe's unvelcro'd!

17:43.062 --> 17:44.164
Okay.

17:45.932 --> 17:47.267
Hi, Mom.

17:47.334 --> 17:49.802
That was not friendly.
That was taunting.

17:51.604 --> 17:53.673
Excuse me, boys.

17:53.740 --> 17:55.675
Dave might be okay
with being called Klompers,

17:55.742 --> 17:57.043
but I'll tell you
who's not.

17:57.110 --> 17:58.911
Is it you?
I feel like it's you.

18:01.013 --> 18:02.749
It is me,
Dave's mother.

18:02.815 --> 18:04.717
And from now on,
you will call him Dave,

18:04.784 --> 18:07.120
and you will call me
Mrs. Pork. Got it?

18:07.187 --> 18:08.988
(BOTH LAUGH)

18:09.055 --> 18:10.390
Why is that funny?

18:10.457 --> 18:11.991
You said "Pork"
Instead of "Park".

18:12.058 --> 18:14.761
Oh, God,
it's happening again.

18:14.827 --> 18:17.164
I meant Park, okay?
Mrs. Park.

18:17.230 --> 18:19.031
Sure thing, Mrs. Pork.

18:19.098 --> 18:20.333
Bye, Mrs. Pork.

18:23.170 --> 18:24.604
Could've just thrown
money at it.

18:28.208 --> 18:30.377
(GASPS)
The mall walkers
are having

18:30.443 --> 18:32.812
an apres-walk pretzel
at Wetzel's!

I thought you'd be out
enjoying your natty satty.

of my friends working
while I wasn't, so...

just when I, I can't even...

18:49.896 --> 18:51.464

18:51.531 --> 18:53.533

before I knew you were
supporting us like this,

19:00.673 --> 19:02.709
I took your computer mouse
and I...

19:02.775 --> 19:04.544
I'm gonna just get you
a new one.

19:05.912 --> 19:07.180
Cool.

19:07.247 --> 19:08.815
Starting Monday,

19:08.881 --> 19:11.184
I've arranged for all of you
to park in the valet lot.

19:11.251 --> 19:12.685
Are you serious?
Shut up.

And I brought bagels.

19:14.487 --> 19:16.289
(GASPS) What?
Where are they?

19:16.356 --> 19:17.857
Well, it's in my car.
I'm gonna go get it
right now.

19:17.924 --> 19:19.926
Oh, Mr. Ken,
I brought the Jewish
donuts you asked for.

19:19.992 --> 19:21.294
Okay.

19:21.361 --> 19:23.029
Sorry I was late.
It was a long line.

19:23.095 --> 19:26.499
Okay, okay, thank you,
Juan-Julio.

19:26.566 --> 19:29.469
What? So, I guess
I'm a tiny bit out of touch.

19:29.536 --> 19:36.075
* Oh, Dr. Ken You Believe
How out of touch I've become

19:36.142 --> 19:40.079
* I Have No Regard
For the lower income

19:40.146 --> 19:43.616
* Dr. Ken You Believe
How out of touch I've become *

19:44.884 --> 19:46.786
It's a good song.

19:46.853 --> 19:48.421
A good song.

19:52.992 --> 19:54.327
Dave, sandwich?
Ah!

19:54.394 --> 19:55.662
Sorry.

19:56.796 --> 19:58.465
What up, Master P's?

19:58.531 --> 20:01.801
Bad news,
another family member
has acquired a nickname.

20:01.868 --> 20:03.236
Dave?

20:03.303 --> 20:05.738
No, I already had a nickname,
Klompers, remember?

20:05.805 --> 20:07.840
(GROANS) Why do I even
throw to you?

20:07.907 --> 20:09.909
Mom, they're still calling you
Mrs. Pork.

20:09.976 --> 20:11.344
It stuck. (GIGGLES)

20:12.645 --> 20:14.247
But they're calling me
Dave again,

20:14.314 --> 20:15.715
so that's on
the up and up.

20:17.850 --> 20:20.052
So, "Mrs. Pork", huh?

20:20.119 --> 20:21.921
Does that make you cross?
Peeved?

20:21.988 --> 20:23.923
Mad as a wet hen?

20:23.990 --> 20:25.525
No.

20:25.592 --> 20:27.794
I think we've all learned
that nicknames are stupid,

20:27.860 --> 20:30.497
so let's just all grow up
and move on, okay?

20:32.265 --> 20:33.966
Make it go away.

20:34.033 --> 20:36.636
Unfortunately, the price
has now skyrocketed to...

20:36.703 --> 20:38.104
I've got $40.
Deal.
