I'm goin' in today.

16:16.240 --> 16:19.392
No, it doesn't hurt.
It just... It looks bad.

16:21.240 --> 16:22.878
Maybe I should
stay home too.

16:23.000 --> 16:24.513
No. You should go.

I think it was some bad clams.

It's a lot of money.

And we're saving up right now,
so Ed can buy the butcher shop.

19:37.280 --> 19:38.429
No. I just...

19:39.200 --> 19:40.759
We got a plan, you know?

19:40.840 --> 19:44.834
The word "we" is a castle, hon,
with a moat and a drawbridge.

19:44.920 --> 19:46.831
And you know what gets
locked up in castles?

19:48.600 --> 19:50.079

19:51.760 --> 19:53.558
Don't be a prisoner of "we."

19:55.000 --> 19:56.320
Take the seminar.

19:56.960 --> 19:59.156
It'll give you
a key to the castle.

20:00.800 --> 20:01.835
Yeah.

Oh, hey, you don't know what
happened to all the TP, do you?

20:08.440 --> 20:09.430
The what's that?

20:09.560 --> 20:12.313
Had a case of TP in the back

it was a local matter last night,

20:20.400 --> 20:21.799
but I slept on it, you know?

20:21.880 --> 20:26.795
And given the level of violence,
and with no apparent suspects,

20:26.880 --> 20:29.759
and the fact that one of
the victims was a judge...

20:29.840 --> 20:31.239
Right, in North Dakota,

20:31.320 --> 20:33.880
which means you're gonna
have all kinds of interstate issues.

20:34.000 --> 20:38.471
So, my thought is, you know,
all the more reason for me...

20:40.880 --> 20:41.995
Yes, sir.

20:42.560 --> 20:43.675

Yeah.

32:55.960 --> 32:57.314
BETSY: I stood up
too fast, is all.

34:00.840 --> 34:01.955
Help you, Officer?

34:03.040 --> 34:05.714
Sir, please roll up
your window.

34:06.800 --> 34:09.440
My friend up front doesn't
like to talk to strangers.

34:10.159 --> 34:12.071
Well, he's gonna talk to me.

34:21.360 --> 34:23.237
What's that town
on The Flintstones?

34:24.600 --> 34:25.795
Is that where we are?

34:26.480 --> 34:28.197
(SINGING) On the Flintstones?

34:28.280 --> 34:31.591
All right, that's it.
Out of the car, all of you.

34:49.360 --> 34:50.589
Your friends, too.

35:00.000 --> 35:02.230
Come around
the driver's side here.

35:10.240 --> 35:12.800
Okay, let me see some IDs.

35:15.560 --> 35:17.198
I'm gonna reach in my pocket.

35:26.720 --> 35:27.835
Now them.

35:51.960 --> 35:53.712

That's us.

36:02.720 --> 36:04.074
Kansas City.

36:05.200 --> 36:07.874
MIKE: What's this about,
Sheriff, if I'm okay to ask?

36:11.520 --> 36:14.672
Now, if I were to search you
three, would I find weapons?

36:15.760 --> 36:17.194
(CHUCKLES) Well, sir.

36:17.280 --> 36:19.556
You have nothin'
to fear from us.

36:19.640 --> 36:22.359
We're just passin' through
town on our way to points south.

36:22.440 --> 36:23.919
Thought we'd stop
for some waffles.

36:24.000 --> 36:25.399
Gale's idea.

36:25.480 --> 36:28.359
Heard you had some
real good ones around here.

36:28.440 --> 36:30.272
So, you can
imagine our surprise

36:30.360 --> 36:34.354
when we find the place closed,
and, apparently, the scene of a crime.

36:37.960 --> 36:39.758
What size shoes you boys wear?

36:40.600 --> 36:42.591
Now, that is
a truly odd question.

36:45.960 --> 36:47.951
Last time I checked,
I was a 10. Boys?

36:54.480 --> 36:56.312
MIKE: Now, I'm gonna go ahead
and guess the boys are an 11,

36:56.440 --> 36:58.829
and not a two, which
would make them toddlers.

36:59.600 --> 37:02.399
Now, unless there's
some law been broken,

37:02.480 --> 37:04.551
I think it's time for
us to be on our way.

37:04.640 --> 37:06.517
I promised the boys' wives
I'd have them home for supper.

37:06.600 --> 37:10.275
And I am, if nothing else,
a man of my word.

37:17.560 --> 37:18.630
Okay.

37:20.160 --> 37:23.471
I got your names
and your plate number.

37:25.080 --> 37:28.835
I'm gonna radio ahead and
make sure you make it out of state.

37:29.680 --> 37:30.670
If not,

37:31.760 --> 37:34.957
I'm gonna put out a APB,
and have you boys rounded up.

37:35.040 --> 37:36.599
And then we'll talk again.

37:37.800 --> 37:39.074
You understand?

37:42.440 --> 37:43.475
MIKE: I do.

37:49.520 --> 37:51.193
And isn't that
a minor miracle?

37:52.240 --> 37:53.514
The state of the world today,

37:53.600 --> 37:56.672
the level of conflict
and misunderstanding,

37:57.680 --> 38:02.197
that two men could stand on
a lonely road in winter and talk,

38:03.040 --> 38:05.839
calmly and rationally.

to your car?

Oh, no. It's nothing.
Just a dust-up.

last night, and hit a tree.

away, but you had me fooled.

in the car, you said.

have to tell the truth.

about the TP.

just ask though.

that's what you like.

at work tomorrow, okay?

on that car I called in?

as a convergence.

reminds you of another.

46:47.800 --> 46:48.835

46:53.000 --> 46:54.513
Wanna talk about it?

46:54.600 --> 46:55.954
Not especially.

47:04.960 --> 47:10.478
We had a guy on the boat, liked
to smoke cigars for breakfast.

47:10.560 --> 47:12.995
Picked up the habit
from his grandad, he said.

47:15.920 --> 47:20.790
This was on
the Bode River, '74.

47:24.400 --> 47:27.153

this kid comes out...

47:27.240 --> 47:29.800
"Cause what could he
have been? Nineteen?

47:31.960 --> 47:34.429
Lights his shit stick,
and then...

47:39.920 --> 47:41.957
He never even
saw it coming.

47:43.200 --> 47:45.271
Shot him right
through the cigar.

47:47.680 --> 47:49.637
A one-in-a-million shot.

47:53.120 --> 47:55.714

face when he fell...

48:10.880 --> 48:11.950

hung himself.

48:17.680 --> 48:19.114

48:19.680 --> 48:22.479

and multiply in
a drop of water.

55:58.840 --> 56:02.515
Few men even consider the
possibility of life on other planets,

56:02.840 --> 56:05.753
and yet,
across the gulf of space,

56:05.920 --> 56:08.719
minds immeasurably
superior to ours,

56:08.960 --> 56:11.793
regarded this
earth with envious eyes

56:12.080 --> 56:16.711
and slowly and surely they
drew their plans against us.
