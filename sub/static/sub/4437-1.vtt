11:47.081 --> 11:48.298
Over here! Grunkle Stan!

11:48.499 --> 11:50.752
For the fifth time, it's not an actual face!

11:51.085 --> 11:52.382
(GRUNTS IN FRUSTRATION)

11:54.130 --> 11:56.474
Finally, we're alone.

11:56.674 --> 11:59.302
Yes. Alone!

11:59.844 --> 12:01.596
Stan! Stan!

12:02.347 --> 12:04.145
Wendy! Wendy, Wendy!

12:04.349 --> 12:07.649
I need to borrow the golf cart
so I can save my sister from a zombie!

12:09.145 --> 12:10.988
Try not to hit any pedestrians.

12:14.734 --> 12:17.783
Dude, it's me. Soos.
This is for the zombies.

12:17.987 --> 12:18.863
Thanks.

12:19.072 --> 12:21.245
And this is in case you see a pifiata.

12:21.699 --> 12:23.372
Uh, thanks?

12:23.952 --> 12:25.795
Better safe than sorry!

12:27.580 --> 12:31.301
Mabel, now that we've gotten to know
each other,

12:31.960 --> 12:33.837
there's something I should tell you.

12:35.255 --> 12:38.134
Oh, Norman. You can tell me anything.

12:38.341 --> 12:40.264
<i>(THINKING) Please be a vampire!
Please be a vampire!</i>

12:40.718 --> 12:43.471
All right, just don't freak out, okay?

12:43.680 --> 12:45.398
Just keep an open mind. Be cool.

12:52.021 --> 12:54.695
Is this weird? Is this too weird?
You need to sit down?

12:55.817 --> 13:01.745
All right. I'll explain. So, we're gnomes.
First off, get that one out of the way.

13:01.948 --> 13:02.870
Uh...

13:03.074 --> 13:07.750
I'm Jeff. And here we have Carson,
Steve, Jason and...

13:07.954 --> 13:09.672
I'm sorry, I always forget your name.

13:09.872 --> 13:11.169
Shmebulock.

13:11.499 --> 13:14.469
Shmebulock, yes! Anyways.

13:14.669 --> 13:18.299
Long story short, us gnomes
have been looking for a new queen.

13:18.506 --> 13:19.382
Right, guys?

13:19.590 --> 13:22.184
(TOGETHER) Queen, queen!

13:22.677 --> 13:24.645
Ha. So what do you say?

13:28.016 --> 13:30.314
Will you join us, in holy matrinomy.

13:30.518 --> 13:34.193
Matri... Matrimony! Blah!
Can't talk today.

13:35.565 --> 13:41.072
Look, I'm sorry, guys.
You're really sweet, but I'm a girl.

13:41.279 --> 13:45.375
And you're gnomes. And it's like, what?

13:46.159 --> 13:47.160
Yikes!

13:47.785 --> 13:50.163
We understand.
We'll never forget you, Mabel.

13:51.622 --> 13:52.839
Because we're gonna kidnap you.

13:53.041 --> 13:54.167
- Huh?
-(YELLING)

13:54.667 --> 13:55.714
(SCREAMING)

13:56.377 --> 13:59.677
Don't worry, Mabel!
I'll save you from that zombie!

14:00.715 --> 14:02.092
MABEL: Help!

14:02.467 --> 14:03.969
Hold on!

14:07.138 --> 14:08.060
The more you struggle,

14:08.264 --> 14:10.437
the more awkward
this is gonna be for everybody!

14:10.641 --> 14:13.190
Just... Okay!
Just get her arm there, Steve.

14:13.811 --> 14:15.563
HEY, let go of me!

14:18.232 --> 14:19.279
(GROANS)

14:21.152 --> 14:23.450
What the heck is going on here?

14:23.988 --> 14:25.035
(HISSES)

14:25.239 --> 14:27.662
Dipper! Norman turned out to be
a bunch of gnomes!

14:27.867 --> 14:30.666
And they're total jerks! Hair! Hair! Hair!

14:30.870 --> 14:32.998
Gnomes? I was way off.

14:34.499 --> 14:37.093
"Gnomes.
Little men of the Gravity Falls forest.

14:37.293 --> 14:38.715
"Weaknesses, Unknown."

14:38.920 --> 14:40.547
Oh, come on!

14:40.755 --> 14:42.757
Hey, hey! Let go of my sister!

14:42.965 --> 14:43.887
Oh. (LAUGHS)

14:44.092 --> 14:48.063
Hey, there! Um, you know, this is all
really just a big misunderstanding.

14:48.262 --> 14:49.980
You see, your sister's not in danger.

14:50.181 --> 14:51.683
She's just marrying
all one thousand of us

14:51.891 --> 14:54.314
and becoming our gnome queen
for all eternity.

14:54.519 --> 14:55.441
Isn't that right, honey?

14:55.645 --> 14:57.898
You guys are butt-faces!

14:58.439 --> 15:00.567
Give her back right now, or else!

15:00.858 --> 15:05.830
You think you can stop us, boy?
You have no idea what we're capable of.

15:06.030 --> 15:08.283
The gnomes are a powerful race!

15:08.491 --> 15:10.209
Do not trifle with the...

15:12.662 --> 15:13.629
(YELLS)

15:15.039 --> 15:18.043
He's getting away with our queen!
No, no, no!

15:18.251 --> 15:19.503
Seatbelt.

15:22.130 --> 15:24.679
You've messed
with the wrong creatures, boy.

15:24.882 --> 15:28.682
Gnomes of the forest, assemble!

15:40.356 --> 15:42.279
Hurry before they come after us!

15:42.483 --> 15:44.906
I wouldn't worry about it.
Did you see their little legs?

15:45.111 --> 15:46.033
The suckers are tiny!

15:46.237 --> 15:47.204
-(I.ouo STOMPING)
-(BRAKES SCREECHING)

15:51.909 --> 15:52.956
Dang.

15:55.037 --> 15:57.381
All right, teamwork, guys.
Like we practiced!

15:57.999 --> 15:59.125
(ROARING)

15:59.667 --> 16:00.884
Move, move!

16:05.465 --> 16:07.058
Come back with our queen!

16:07.258 --> 16:08.430
It's getting closer!

16:19.061 --> 16:20.984
-(HORN HONKS)
- Shmebulock...

16:24.609 --> 16:25.861
I'll save you, Dipper!

16:31.782 --> 16:33.830
- Thanks, Mabel!
- Don't mention it.

16:38.873 --> 16:40.216
Look out!

16:40.500 --> 16:42.047
(BOTH SCREAMING)

16:47.423 --> 16:48.595
(BOTH GROANING)

16:50.593 --> 16:52.391
Stay back, man!

16:54.805 --> 16:55.852
(BOTH SCREAMING)

16:56.682 --> 16:57.979
Where's Grunkle Stan?

16:58.684 --> 17:01.608
Behold...
The world's most distracting object!

17:01.812 --> 17:02.813
(ALL EXCLAIMING)

17:03.022 --> 17:05.116
Just try to look away, you can't!

17:06.567 --> 17:08.490
I can't even remember
what I was talking about.

17:09.737 --> 17:10.954
JEFF: It's the end of the line, kids!

17:11.155 --> 17:13.782
Mabel, marry us
before we do something crazy!

17:13.991 --> 17:15.367
There's gotta be a way out of this.

17:16.827 --> 17:17.919
I gotta do it.

17:18.119 --> 17:20.873
What? Mabel!
Don't do this! Are you crazy?

17:21.332 --> 17:22.628
- Trust me.
- What?

17:22.833 --> 17:25.882
Dipper, just this once, trust me.

17:30.007 --> 17:32.510
All right, Jeff. I'll marry you.

17:32.718 --> 17:35.062
Hot dog! Help me down there, Jason.
Thanks, Andy.

17:35.263 --> 17:38.392
All right, left foot, there we go.
Watch those fingers, Mike.

17:41.561 --> 17:42.687
Eh? Eh?

17:45.064 --> 17:46.190
Bada-bing, bada-bam!

17:46.399 --> 17:48.197
Now let's get
you back into the forest honey.

17:48.401 --> 17:50.495
You may now kiss the bride.

17:51.279 --> 17:53.873
Well! Don't mind if I do.

17:59.412 --> 18:01.039
Hey, hey, wait a minute.

18:03.541 --> 18:04.838
What's going on?

18:05.418 --> 18:06.340
(SCREAMING)

18:06.544 --> 18:07.921
That's for lying to me!

18:09.839 --> 18:11.386
That's for breaking my heart!

18:11.674 --> 18:12.846
Ow! My face!

18:13.050 --> 18:15.724
And this is for messing with my brother!

18:15.928 --> 18:16.850
(GROANS)

18:17.054 --> 18:18.931
- Wanna do the honors?
- On three!

18:19.140 --> 18:20.642
- One! Two! Three!
- One! Two! Three!

18:23.060 --> 18:26.234
(SCREAMING) I'll get you back for this!

18:26.856 --> 18:27.778
(ALL SCREAMING)

18:27.982 --> 18:29.655
Who's giving orders? I need orders!

18:29.859 --> 18:31.657
My arms are tired.

18:32.528 --> 18:33.950
Anyone else wants some?

18:43.914 --> 18:48.044
Hey, Dipper,
I'm sorry for ignoring your advice.

18:48.252 --> 18:50.004
You really were just looking out for me.

18:50.463 --> 18:53.512
Oh, don't be like that.
You saved our butts back there!

18:53.716 --> 18:54.717
I guess I'm just sad

18:54.925 --> 18:57.895
that my first boyfriend turned out
to be a bunch of gnomes.

18:58.095 --> 19:01.099
Look on the bright side.
Maybe the next one will be a vampire.

19:01.307 --> 19:03.685
Oh! You're just saying that!

19:03.893 --> 19:05.486
Awkward sibling hug?

19:06.228 --> 19:07.354
Awkward sibling hug.

19:08.439 --> 19:09.440
- Pat. Pat.

19:12.360 --> 19:15.204
Sheesh! You two get hit
by a bus or something? Ha!

19:18.115 --> 19:21.460
Hey! Wouldn't you know it?

19:21.661 --> 19:23.663
I accidentally overstocked
some inventory,

19:23.871 --> 19:26.670
so, how's about you each take one item
from the gift shop,

19:26.874 --> 19:27.875
on the house, you know?

19:28.084 --> 19:29.631
- Really?
- What's the catch?

19:29.835 --> 19:32.964
That catch is do it before I change
my mind. Now take something.

19:33.631 --> 19:35.178
- Hmm...
- Ooh! (CHUCKLES)

19:38.260 --> 19:39.227
Hmm.

19:39.428 --> 19:40.475
That ought to do the trick!

19:40.680 --> 19:44.981
And I will have a grappling hook!

19:46.018 --> 19:47.110
Yes!

19:47.311 --> 19:49.405
Wouldn't you rather have,
like, a doll or something?

19:52.233 --> 19:53.610
Grappling hook!

19:53.818 --> 19:54.785
Fair enough!

DIPPER: <i>This journal told me there
was no one in Gravity Falls I could trust.</i>

gnomes side by side with someone,</i>

20:05.246 --> 20:08.750
<i>you realize that they've probably
always got your back.</i>

20:09.625 --> 20:10.751
Hey, Mabel, could you get the light?

20:11.168 --> 20:12.636
I'm on it.

20:14.213 --> 20:15.260
It worked!

20:15.631 --> 20:16.757

nothing strange about this town.</i>
