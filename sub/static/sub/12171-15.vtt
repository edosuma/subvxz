15:32.918 --> 15:35.792
Why small?

15:35.792 --> 15:37.626
No, okay, big day.

15:37.667 --> 15:39.459
But anyway,

15:39.459 --> 15:41.250
Tommy ruined it for me.

15:42.792 --> 15:44.125
Mom, it's not your day.

15:44.167 --> 15:46.083
He asked me to marry him

15:46.083 --> 15:47.959
and you insulted him.

15:48.000 --> 15:49.250
Thank you.

15:49.292 --> 15:50.542
What I wanted to say,

15:50.542 --> 15:51.751
a couple of things,

15:51.792 --> 15:55.584
is that you're my only mom,

15:55.626 --> 15:57.626
I'm your only child forever.

15:57.626 --> 15:59.542
- But it's always me
- against you

15:59.584 --> 16:01.417
- And the respect
- that I have for you

16:01.459 --> 16:02.959
- And the love
- that I have for you

16:03.000 --> 16:04.083
And the Patience

16:04.125 --> 16:05.209
that I have in my heart

16:05.250 --> 16:06.959
keeps my mouth shut,

16:07.000 --> 16:08.167
but I don't want you

16:08.167 --> 16:09.334
to hurt Tommy

16:09.375 --> 16:11.334
- and I don't want you
- to insult him

16:11.375 --> 16:13.250
Because he doesn't...

16:13.250 --> 16:15.125
He deserves better.

16:17.292 --> 16:19.125
Oh, now you're on his side?

16:19.167 --> 16:20.501
Then why don't you go

16:20.501 --> 16:21.792
and be with him completely,

16:21.834 --> 16:23.000
totally, and forget

16:23.000 --> 16:24.167
about your mom?

16:25.667 --> 16:27.334
Is that what you wanna do?

16:27.375 --> 16:29.125
- I don't want you
- to insult him.

16:29.167 --> 16:30.417
Mom, listen to me

16:30.417 --> 16:31.667
for a second.

16:31.667 --> 16:32.709
My mom is operating

16:32.709 --> 16:33.751
from the fear

16:33.792 --> 16:35.083
that I'm gonna abandon her

16:35.083 --> 16:36.334
for Tommy.

16:36.375 --> 16:37.501
The way that I saw you

16:37.501 --> 16:38.626
treating Tommy

16:38.667 --> 16:40.334
is not cool at all.

16:40.334 --> 16:41.501
- Do you like him?
- The reason I was [Inaudible].

16:41.542 --> 16:43.167
- Yes.
- You love him?

16:43.167 --> 16:44.792
Love.

16:44.834 --> 16:46.000
I want her in my life

16:46.042 --> 16:48.042
but I no longer

16:48.083 --> 16:51.042

16:51.083 --> 16:52.083
He's not the right

16:52.125 --> 16:53.125

16:54.501 --> 16:55.876
You're wrong, mom.

16:58.709 --> 16:59.876

17:03.000 --> 17:06.375

- Yeah.

17:22.375 --> 17:23.459

how everything

19:13.167 --> 19:16.125
has changed so much.

after everything

19:20.959 --> 19:22.626
that golnesa put you through,

19:22.667 --> 19:24.501
you've shown a tremendous

19:24.501 --> 19:26.334
amount of empathy,

19:26.334 --> 19:27.876
forgiveness, I don't even know

19:27.876 --> 19:29.417
what it is, compassion.

19:29.459 --> 19:30.584

- to hate her.

- And I think she is and
- she turns to alcohol or drugs

- To kind of help her
- cope with it.

19:39.667 --> 19:40.751

19:40.751 --> 19:41.792

it could destroy my career,

30:46.667 --> 30:48.209
"together for 17,903 days."

30:48.250 --> 30:49.334
That's how many days

30:49.375 --> 30:50.542
we've all been together

30:50.542 --> 30:51.709
right here.

30:55.542 --> 30:57.334
- Oh my god.
- To Asa.

30:57.375 --> 30:58.792
Yay.

30:58.792 --> 31:00.167
To Asa.

31:00.209 --> 31:01.542
Together,

31:01.542 --> 31:03.459

- no matter what.

[Speaking Farsi]

31:04.959 --> 31:06.375
That was beautiful.

31:06.375 --> 31:07.709
- Thank you guys for being here.
- I love you all.

31:07.709 --> 31:09.042
- Thank you.
- Beautiful.

31:09.042 --> 31:10.125
- Amazing.

Yes, let's have a drink.

31:23.959 --> 31:25.334
- These are flowers for you.
- Oh.

31:25.375 --> 31:26.792
It says,

31:26.792 --> 31:28.209
"Asa, please read aloud."

31:28.250 --> 31:30.209
Dear Asa joon,

31:30.250 --> 31:32.167
congrats on tonight.

31:32.209 --> 31:34.417
I want to apologize

31:34.417 --> 31:37.000
for my years of bad behavior.

31:37.042 --> 31:39.417
I've called you a transvestite

31:39.417 --> 31:40.501
- and I've even tried
- "to jump you."

31:40.542 --> 31:41.751
Gg?

31:41.751 --> 31:42.751
"I'm truly ashamed,"

please forgive me.

31:43.792 --> 31:44.792
"Gg."

- Wow.

Oh, shervin, you got one, too.

31:49.918 --> 31:51.751

- I want to apologize

31:51.751 --> 31:52.918
"For being so vindictive."

"Dear Asa joon,"

32:07.626 --> 32:09.542

32:09.584 --> 32:11.542
I want to apologize

32:11.584 --> 32:13.792
"for my years of bad behavior."

32:13.792 --> 32:14.792
What's she wearing?

32:14.834 --> 32:16.125
She looks like a transvestite

32:16.125 --> 32:17.709
- and doesn't do anything
- about it.

32:17.751 --> 32:19.417

It's a clean slate.

33:39.542 --> 33:41.876
I am feeling very confused

33:41.876 --> 33:43.167
and disoriented

33:43.209 --> 33:44.792
but it doesn't - matter

33:44.834 --> 33:46.083
Because this is really

33:46.083 --> 33:47.292
the perfect apology,

33:47.334 --> 33:48.542
it's heartfelt

33:48.542 --> 33:50.334
and it's accountable.

33:52.542 --> 33:54.375
I mean, I need a drink.

33:54.375 --> 33:55.459
You have one.

For you.

"Dear Reza joon."

33:57.876 --> 33:59.125
I wanna apologize

33:59.167 --> 34:00.709
for calling you fat,

34:00.709 --> 34:02.792
old, Saddam Hussein,

34:02.834 --> 34:04.459
a south beach crackhead

34:04.501 --> 34:05.876
and most recently,

34:05.876 --> 34:08.125
for making up a disgusting lie

34:08.167 --> 34:09.375
that I have footage of you

34:09.375 --> 34:11.501
blowing someone at the gym.

34:12.876 --> 34:14.375
I have always harbored

34:14.375 --> 34:15.876
resentment towards you.

34:15.918 --> 34:17.542
Please forgive me.

34:17.584 --> 34:19.083
I know that I act

34:19.083 --> 34:20.542
like your enemy

34:20.584 --> 34:22.751
"but I actually love you. Gg."

34:26.626 --> 34:28.042
Good girl.

34:28.042 --> 34:29.417
Group hug, group hug.

34:29.417 --> 34:30.542
I think what's happening

34:30.584 --> 34:32.709
is golnesa has had, like,

34:32.751 --> 34:36.584
a crazy life-shifting epiphany

34:36.626 --> 34:38.167
and it's quite,

34:38.209 --> 34:40.250
like, shockingly amazing.

34:40.250 --> 34:41.667
I mean, to the point

34:41.667 --> 34:43.083
where my mom is super emotional,

34:43.125 --> 34:44.209
my mom's crying.

34:45.792 --> 34:46.918
So,

34:46.918 --> 34:49.542
I have a confession.

34:52.083 --> 34:54.209
I wrote all the letters.

34:56.626 --> 34:58.083
That's crazy.

34:58.125 --> 35:00.125
I wrote each one of them.

35:00.125 --> 35:02.876
I'm completely confused.

35:02.918 --> 35:04.083
I've never affiliated

35:04.083 --> 35:05.209
with human beings

35:05.250 --> 35:08.083
that would go this low

35:08.125 --> 35:09.459
to hurt somebody.

35:09.459 --> 35:11.209
I'm sad, I'm embarrassed,

35:11.250 --> 35:13.459
I'm beyond disgusted.

35:13.459 --> 35:16.083
Reza can go f... himself.

35:16.125 --> 35:17.959
I wrote all the letters

35:18.000 --> 35:19.542
because I realized

35:19.542 --> 35:21.083
each one of us

35:21.125 --> 35:23.626
deserves an apology from golnesa

35:23.626 --> 35:24.667
and she doesn't know

35:24.667 --> 35:25.709
how to say "I'm sorry."

35:25.751 --> 35:27.209
- And you know what?
- F... it,

35:27.250 --> 35:28.584
If she can't do it,

35:28.626 --> 35:29.959
I thought, "you know what?"

35:29.959 --> 35:31.459
I'm gonna step the f... up

35:31.459 --> 35:33.334
- and give it to everyone
- "tonight."

35:33.375 --> 35:35.042
We've tried many,

35:35.042 --> 35:36.667
many, many ways

35:36.709 --> 35:38.334
to help gg

35:38.375 --> 35:40.250
and none of it has worked.

35:40.292 --> 35:43.167
And this comes from a place

35:43.167 --> 35:45.250
of compassion and hope.

35:45.292 --> 35:47.167
And I know she wants to do it,

35:47.167 --> 35:48.334
I think she wishes

35:48.375 --> 35:49.667
it could have been her.

35:49.709 --> 35:50.834
But instead of her,

35:50.834 --> 35:51.959
it was me tonight.

35:52.000 --> 35:53.000
But next time,

35:53.000 --> 35:54.000
it's gonna be her.

35:54.000 --> 35:55.083
That's crazy.

35:55.083 --> 35:56.167
Shocking.

35:56.167 --> 35:58.334
- I'm shocked, I can't react.
- So you were speaking for me?

35:58.334 --> 35:59.959
I was speaking for you.

36:00.000 --> 36:01.501
Everybody read these letters.

36:01.501 --> 36:02.834
Everybody read these letters.

36:02.834 --> 36:04.334
- Is this how you feel?
- You wrote all these cards?

36:04.334 --> 36:06.292
- Are these your feelings?
- I wrote all of them.

36:06.334 --> 36:08.334
- They may not be your words.
- I'm sorry.

36:08.375 --> 36:09.959
You know what,

36:10.000 --> 36:11.667
- other than the sh...
- Talking parts

36:11.667 --> 36:13.584
- That came in the first
- two sentences.

36:13.626 --> 36:15.709
Thank you for doing that

36:15.709 --> 36:16.876
but that does need

36:16.876 --> 36:18.042
to come from her, okay?

36:18.042 --> 36:19.542
- Huh?
- You cannot speak for her,

36:19.542 --> 36:20.876
That needs to come from her.

36:20.876 --> 36:22.626
- I know deep down
- this is kind of how she feels

36:22.667 --> 36:24.292
- Because she didn't refutes any
- of it.

36:24.334 --> 36:25.792
- Can you give me
- some more tito's, please?

36:25.834 --> 36:26.876
I am disgusted

36:26.918 --> 36:29.709
because all these apologies

36:29.709 --> 36:30.959
are things that

36:30.959 --> 36:32.209
I've already apologized for

36:32.209 --> 36:33.542
to these people in the past.

36:33.584 --> 36:35.167
- These are things
- we've gotten over.

36:35.209 --> 36:36.876
- I really thought
- she wrote these things.

36:36.876 --> 36:37.959
Me too.

36:38.000 --> 36:39.626
- I never sign
- anything off "gg."

36:39.667 --> 36:41.000
It's always "golnesa."

36:41.042 --> 36:42.209
Can I tell you,

36:42.209 --> 36:43.584
I have a very crazy perspective

36:43.584 --> 36:44.959
on this right now.

36:45.000 --> 36:46.209
If you could see a world

36:46.209 --> 36:47.375
where you mean this

36:47.375 --> 36:48.542
- and I know you do.
- No, I mean it.

36:48.542 --> 36:50.209
- You would mean it.
- Listen.

36:50.250 --> 36:52.042
- Everything Reza wrote
- in those cards

36:52.042 --> 36:53.042
Is the truth.

36:53.083 --> 36:55.209
Take this and make it yours

36:55.209 --> 36:56.709
and take the power away from it,

36:56.709 --> 36:57.751
make it yours.

36:57.792 --> 36:58.918
Go over there right now

36:58.918 --> 37:00.000
and say, "you know what guys?"

37:00.042 --> 37:01.918
I know this is f... ing crazy.

37:01.918 --> 37:03.083
I didn't write this stuff

37:03.083 --> 37:04.209
but you know what,

37:04.250 --> 37:05.375
as you were reading all that,

37:05.417 --> 37:07.167
- that's in my heart
- "and I mean that."

37:07.209 --> 37:08.918
- And if you don't feel it
- then don't.

37:08.959 --> 37:10.250
- It's a mockery, Asa.
- Then turn it around

37:10.250 --> 37:11.334
For yourself,

37:11.334 --> 37:12.375
take it for you.

37:12.417 --> 37:14.542
Do you wonder why he did that?

37:14.584 --> 37:15.751
Do you ask him like,

37:15.751 --> 37:16.918
what's your purpose?

37:16.959 --> 37:18.250
I thought I was coming here

37:18.250 --> 37:20.083
to celebrate Asa

37:20.083 --> 37:21.918
and it seems like attention

37:21.918 --> 37:23.083
has gone somewhere else.

37:23.125 --> 37:25.584
This is a Reza art show,

37:25.584 --> 37:27.167
this isn't about anything else.

37:27.209 --> 37:28.876
This is Reza's time

37:28.918 --> 37:30.250
and here we go.

37:30.250 --> 37:32.501
May I do a toast?

37:32.542 --> 37:34.334
- Everybody has their own
- feelings right now,

37:34.375 --> 37:37.167
There's a lot happening, okay.

37:37.209 --> 37:38.584
I would like to say that...

37:38.626 --> 37:40.250
Things are not gonna be

37:40.250 --> 37:41.876
the same after tonight.

37:41.918 --> 37:42.959
- Things are not gonna be
- the same after tonight.

37:43.000 --> 37:44.876
Tonight is called "together."

37:44.918 --> 37:46.292
- And apart. And apart.
- When I asked my parents,

37:46.292 --> 37:48.876
"What's the secret, 43 years?"

37:48.918 --> 37:50.459
- They said three things,
- they said,

37:50.459 --> 37:51.709
"Love, Patience

37:51.709 --> 37:52.959
and forgiveness."

37:52.959 --> 37:54.250
Okay? And none

37:54.250 --> 37:55.542
of those things are easy.

37:55.584 --> 37:56.959
If they were easy,

37:57.000 --> 37:58.584
- everybody would do them
- all the time.

37:58.626 --> 37:59.626
They're not easy.

37:59.626 --> 38:00.792
This is my family,

38:00.792 --> 38:01.959
I love you guys.

38:02.000 --> 38:03.375
- Salamati.
- We need to talk.

38:03.417 --> 38:04.626
Hello. But don't you think

38:04.626 --> 38:05.792
the one person

38:05.792 --> 38:07.125
that should address everybody

38:07.167 --> 38:09.125
should say something?

38:09.125 --> 38:10.792
- Cheers. Cheers to togetherness.
- Before we all leave,

38:10.792 --> 38:12.709
- Do you wanna say
- something or not?

38:12.751 --> 38:14.459
- Do you wanna say something?
- Yes,

38:14.459 --> 38:16.125
- I wanna say something.
- Say it.

38:16.125 --> 38:17.459
Do you have a video of me

38:17.459 --> 38:18.792
blowing somebody?

38:18.792 --> 38:20.834
- Let me ask you something.
- Do you have a video of me

38:20.834 --> 38:22.167
- Blowing somebody?
- 100 percent.

38:22.209 --> 38:23.292
- You do?
- 100 percent.

38:23.334 --> 38:24.834
100 percent. Okay.

38:24.834 --> 38:26.334
So...

38:26.375 --> 38:27.834
So, I can never have

38:27.876 --> 38:29.334
anything to do with her

38:29.375 --> 38:30.834
because she will try

38:30.876 --> 38:32.334
and take everybody down.

38:32.334 --> 38:33.667
I guess there's a video

38:33.667 --> 38:35.000
of Reza doing some stuff.

38:35.042 --> 38:36.250
I didn't ask any questions

38:36.250 --> 38:37.417
when it was told to me.

38:37.459 --> 38:39.167
I don't wanna get involved

38:39.167 --> 38:40.834
in that gossip type stuff,

38:40.876 --> 38:42.334
but if someone's

38:42.334 --> 38:43.751
saying it exists,

38:43.792 --> 38:44.834
maybe it does.

38:44.876 --> 38:46.501
- Oh, so you don't wanna
- hear anything?

38:46.542 --> 38:47.918
No. Because

38:47.918 --> 38:49.292
your sh... is foul.

38:49.334 --> 38:50.501
Just say sorry,

38:50.542 --> 38:52.501
- everyone tee'd you up.
- Sorry for what?

38:52.501 --> 38:54.125
For being such a disgusting

38:54.125 --> 38:55.751
person sometimes.

38:55.792 --> 38:57.167
Grow the f... up

38:57.167 --> 38:59.083
- and apologize to everybody.
- You're right. You're right.

38:59.125 --> 39:00.834
For once in your f... ing life.

39:00.876 --> 39:02.334
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry

39:02.334 --> 39:03.792
I hurt you, Reza.

39:03.834 --> 39:04.876
- I apologize.
- Good.

39:04.876 --> 39:06.125
- You're so right.
- Good.

39:06.167 --> 39:07.709
I am so sorry.

39:07.709 --> 39:08.959
Because of me,

39:08.959 --> 39:10.167
you've become so distraught.

39:10.209 --> 39:11.709
- I apologize.
- You guys...

39:11.709 --> 39:13.709
- The fact that the evening
- is called "together"

39:13.751 --> 39:14.876
And here we are so un-together.

39:14.918 --> 39:16.250
Show people, everyone

39:16.250 --> 39:17.542
the video, bitch.

39:17.584 --> 39:19.459
- Show the f... ing video.
- Honey, let's go, let's go.

39:19.501 --> 39:20.709
- Let's just go.
- Come on, come on. Come on.

39:20.709 --> 39:21.876
You are a disgrace

39:21.876 --> 39:23.042
of a human being.

39:23.042 --> 39:24.792
- I am.
- Reza, come on. Reza.

39:24.834 --> 39:26.626
Just go. Let's just go.

39:26.667 --> 39:28.042
- You guys go.
- I'm kind of torn

39:28.083 --> 39:29.209
Between being the bigger

39:29.250 --> 39:30.375
person right now

39:30.375 --> 39:31.626
and just flashbacks

39:31.626 --> 39:32.876
of every single thing

39:32.918 --> 39:34.709
that Reza has done to me,

39:34.709 --> 39:36.250
and I don't know

39:36.250 --> 39:37.792
what to be right now.

39:37.834 --> 39:39.209
I wanna rage

39:39.209 --> 39:40.876
but I wanna rise above.

39:40.918 --> 39:42.000
I wanna rage

39:42.042 --> 39:44.042
but I wanna rise above.

39:46.292 --> 39:48.334
Let's grab dinner, come on.

39:50.250 --> 39:51.334
F... this sh...

39:51.375 --> 39:52.709
Can I go in the same

39:52.751 --> 39:54.083
car with you?

39:54.125 --> 39:55.209
Golnesa.

39:55.209 --> 39:56.250
Let me go, [Inaudible].

39:56.250 --> 39:58.876
Okay, okay, okay, okay. Okay.

40:02.042 --> 40:03.042
You are a disgrace

40:03.042 --> 40:04.042
of a human being.

40:04.083 --> 40:06.042
- Reza, come on. Reza.
- I am.

40:06.083 --> 40:08.709
Just go.

40:08.751 --> 40:10.918
Let's grab dinner, come on.

40:10.918 --> 40:12.250
The evening is over.

40:12.250 --> 40:14.709
Togetherness, apartness.

40:14.751 --> 40:16.209
It turns out there is very

40:16.250 --> 40:17.709
little understanding

40:17.751 --> 40:19.250
amongst us.

40:21.375 --> 40:22.834
F... this sh...

40:22.876 --> 40:24.334
Get the f... out of here.

40:24.375 --> 40:25.792
- Golnesa.
- Stop it.

40:25.834 --> 40:28.042
Let me go, [Inaudible].

40:28.083 --> 40:29.375
Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.

40:29.417 --> 40:30.792
F... his ass.

40:30.834 --> 40:32.959
F... you, you f... ing bitch.

40:32.959 --> 40:34.042
- Ow, gg!
- F... ing...

40:34.083 --> 40:35.209
F... ing f... you.

40:35.250 --> 40:36.375
F... you.

40:36.417 --> 40:37.459
- Okay.
- F... you.

40:37.459 --> 40:38.792
- Alright.
- I'm not gonna let go of you.

40:38.792 --> 40:39.959
You're a piece of sh...

40:39.959 --> 40:41.125
Honey, stop it.

40:41.125 --> 40:42.334
Can you stop it?

40:42.375 --> 40:43.584
You have no respect.

40:43.626 --> 40:44.709
You have no respect.

40:44.709 --> 40:45.792
Let go of me.

40:45.834 --> 40:47.626
- You have no respect.
- Let go of me.

40:47.626 --> 40:48.876
You have no respect.

40:48.876 --> 40:50.125
You're a piece of sh...

40:50.125 --> 40:51.626
- Piece of sh...
- You make your mother cry.

40:51.667 --> 40:52.959
- Alright, alright, alright.
- That's enough.

40:53.000 --> 40:54.459
Let go of me.

40:54.459 --> 40:55.626
Let go of me.

40:55.626 --> 40:56.792
No.

40:56.792 --> 40:57.959
Not gonna happen.

40:58.000 --> 40:59.959
- Relax. Come on, let's go.
- Don't stop me.

41:00.000 --> 41:01.292
Step away.

41:01.334 --> 41:02.459
I said stop, please.

41:02.501 --> 41:03.792
- Let go of me.
- No.

41:03.792 --> 41:05.250
Put your shoes on

41:05.292 --> 41:06.334
and get in the car.

41:06.334 --> 41:07.334
That's f... ed up.

41:09.209 --> 41:10.834
- Stop.
- Relax, relax.

41:10.834 --> 41:12.000
I'm f... ing shaking right now.

41:12.042 --> 41:13.167
Just cool off, I'm with you.

41:13.167 --> 41:14.334
I want you to let me go.

41:14.375 --> 41:16.000
Okay. Just cool off.

41:16.000 --> 41:17.626
[Inaudible]

41:19.334 --> 41:20.751
- I love you, I need to go home.
- Are you sure?

41:20.792 --> 41:21.834
Yeah.

41:21.834 --> 41:22.959
You are?

41:22.959 --> 41:24.083
I need to go home.

41:24.125 --> 41:26.083
- From now on,
- golnesa is a person

41:26.125 --> 41:28.501
That exists independent of me.

41:28.542 --> 41:30.000
She will do her thing.

41:30.042 --> 41:32.125
I don't wish her any harm

41:32.167 --> 41:33.334
and I hope that her life

41:33.375 --> 41:34.584
becomes better

41:34.626 --> 41:36.167
and she finds her way,

41:36.209 --> 41:38.667
but that does not include me

41:38.709 --> 41:40.125
at all moving forward.

41:43.000 --> 41:45.959
[Music playing]

41:47.375 --> 41:48.709
Nobody here is perfect,

41:48.709 --> 41:50.042
no one.

41:50.042 --> 41:51.626
We either love hard

41:51.667 --> 41:53.792
or we hate hard.

41:53.834 --> 41:55.542
- The mistakes
- aren't the problem,

41:55.542 --> 41:58.542
But it's how you act afterwards.

41:58.584 --> 42:00.876
- The whole reason
- why we have these complicated,

42:00.918 --> 42:02.125
Imperfect relationships

42:02.167 --> 42:03.250
is so that we can all

42:03.250 --> 42:04.292
band together

42:04.334 --> 42:05.959
and help each other

42:05.959 --> 42:07.626
figure out our problems.

42:07.667 --> 42:08.709
- I think that's part
- of the reason

42:08.709 --> 42:10.876
Why we need each other.

42:10.876 --> 42:12.375
This group is like an atom,

42:12.417 --> 42:13.667
the molecules

42:13.667 --> 42:14.876
are constantly changing,

42:14.918 --> 42:16.000
new relationships,

42:16.042 --> 42:18.709
make-ups, break-ups,

42:18.709 --> 42:20.125
but at the end of the day,

42:20.167 --> 42:21.626
the core group is always

42:21.626 --> 42:23.042
staying together.

42:23.083 --> 42:25.542
We're a group of persians

42:25.542 --> 42:27.501
that have dealt with

42:27.501 --> 42:29.459
so many situations

42:29.501 --> 42:31.876
that makes us family.

42:31.918 --> 42:33.167
And if you look

42:33.167 --> 42:34.375
at your own family,

42:34.417 --> 42:36.751
you can love and hate

42:36.751 --> 42:39.042
and laugh and scream

42:39.083 --> 42:40.501
and cry

42:40.542 --> 42:41.918
and then make up.

42:41.959 --> 42:43.667
But with gg,

42:43.709 --> 42:45.542
I'm done.

42:45.584 --> 42:46.626
Regardless of how much

42:46.626 --> 42:47.667
some of these people

42:47.709 --> 42:49.667
might've hurt me recently,

42:49.709 --> 42:51.209
there's always gonna

42:51.250 --> 42:52.751
be this much hope

42:52.792 --> 42:54.584
for a better tomorrow

42:54.626 --> 42:55.918
and I'm gonna hang onto that,

42:55.959 --> 42:57.083
even if it's by

42:57.125 --> 42:58.250
a tiny little thread.

42:58.292 --> 42:59.626
I'm sorry.
