WEBVTT

00:00.001 --> 00:04.470
<i> Previously on</i> Reign.
I told you he's been
like this for weeks.

00:04.472 --> 00:06.171
Sullen, unresponsive.

00:06.173 --> 00:07.606
I should never have become king.

00:07.608 --> 00:10.075
I will fix this.

00:10.077 --> 00:11.744
No!

00:11.746 --> 00:13.612
This is what you two
have been doing.

00:13.614 --> 00:15.647
Misplacing the King of France.

00:15.649 --> 00:17.116
The time has come
for the Valois

00:17.118 --> 00:18.350
to step down.

00:18.352 --> 00:20.586
Spain must take control.

00:20.588 --> 00:23.455
Is the queen asking me
to use military force?

00:23.457 --> 00:26.658
The queen is asking you
to bring her Darnley.

00:26.660 --> 00:28.360
DARNLEY:
<i>This Englishman killed my guard</i>

00:28.362 --> 00:29.528
and then tried to murder me.

00:29.530 --> 00:30.662
MARY:
Get out of our country

00:30.664 --> 00:33.232
or we will drive you out.

00:33.234 --> 00:34.666
Tell me what you gave Agatha.

00:34.668 --> 00:36.468
<i> The cure you're looking for</i>

00:36.470 --> 00:37.369
doesn't exist.

00:37.371 --> 00:38.404
Then she will die?

00:38.406 --> 00:39.605
Yes.

00:39.607 --> 00:41.373
Elizabeth will keep
coming after us.

00:41.375 --> 00:43.475
Let her come;
let the danger come.

00:43.477 --> 00:46.045
Doesn't it make
you feel alive?

00:47.648 --> 00:49.248
Keira, what are
you doing here?

00:49.250 --> 00:50.282
I'm going to marry

00:50.284 --> 00:51.450
the Queen of Scotland.

00:51.451 --> 00:52.617
She'll never win
your heart, Darnley.

00:52.620 --> 00:54.086
It's mine.

01:02.496 --> 01:06.298
This is not the dead body
I was hoping for, Ambassador.

01:06.300 --> 01:08.100
Queen Mary
insisted I bring

01:08.102 --> 01:09.334
the assassin's corpse
back to you.

01:09.336 --> 01:10.736
She blames me

01:10.738 --> 01:12.371
for the assassination attempt

01:12.373 --> 01:13.739
on Lord Darnley's life.

01:13.741 --> 01:15.541
Your failure
to eliminate Darnley

01:15.543 --> 01:17.376
has caused me
public embarrassment.

01:17.378 --> 01:18.610
I'm sorry, Your Majesty.

01:18.612 --> 01:20.145
Do you want me
to send another agent?

01:20.147 --> 01:21.280
No.

01:21.282 --> 01:22.648
Any further attempt
on his life,

01:22.650 --> 01:24.083
successful or not,

01:24.085 --> 01:25.551
will clearly point back to me

01:25.553 --> 01:27.286
and make me appear weak.

01:27.288 --> 01:28.654
And I see no way
to stop this wedding.

01:28.656 --> 01:29.855
Then what do you suggest?

01:29.857 --> 01:32.324
Because after
Lord Darnley

01:32.326 --> 01:34.560
and Queen Mary wed,
they will raise an army,

01:34.562 --> 01:36.662
they'll gather
international support,

01:36.664 --> 01:38.730
and they will come
after my throne.

01:38.732 --> 01:41.366
The time to move on Scotland
is now.

01:41.368 --> 01:42.434
Your Majesty, if I may...

01:42.436 --> 01:43.268
What?

01:43.270 --> 01:44.169
Help me?

01:44.171 --> 01:45.571
Advise me?

01:45.573 --> 01:47.473
Please, Ambassador.

01:47.475 --> 01:49.708
Lord Blackburn and I
occasionally disagreed,

01:49.710 --> 01:51.543
but at least
he didn't mince words.

01:51.545 --> 01:52.544
Then neither will I.

01:52.546 --> 01:53.745
You cannot invade Scotland

01:53.747 --> 01:55.247
without reason.

01:55.249 --> 01:57.116
Then find me a reason.

01:57.118 --> 01:58.450
This marriage
is an act

01:58.452 --> 02:01.153
of aggression
and I will not sit by,

02:01.155 --> 02:03.422
helplessly waiting
for the sword to fall.

02:03.424 --> 02:05.491
♪ ♪

02:14.735 --> 02:17.136
MARY: Come on, Greer,
we're almost there.

02:18.873 --> 02:20.272
Oh, Mary,

02:20.274 --> 02:22.341
it's beautiful.
I told you.

02:22.343 --> 02:24.877
Darnley and I found it
while on one of our rides.

02:24.879 --> 02:27.279
Admit it, Greer, it's the
perfect place to get married.

02:27.281 --> 02:28.580
Not for a queen.

02:28.582 --> 02:29.615
Well, queen of the fairies,

02:29.617 --> 02:30.616
maybe,
but your wedding

02:30.618 --> 02:31.750
is a major
political event.

02:31.752 --> 02:33.318
Hundreds of guests,

02:33.320 --> 02:35.821
official ceremonies,
legal formalities...

02:35.823 --> 02:37.356
And that's the problem.

02:37.358 --> 02:39.324
So much of this
wedding isn't about

02:39.326 --> 02:40.759
who Darnley and
I really are.

02:40.761 --> 02:41.827
You mean, who you and Darnley

02:41.829 --> 02:43.595
have become.

02:43.597 --> 02:45.364
As much as I'd
like to run away

02:45.366 --> 02:47.366
and elope in a
magical forest,

02:47.368 --> 02:48.901
political realities
are part

02:48.903 --> 02:50.836
of my life... and this wedding.

02:50.838 --> 02:51.870
You did have

02:51.872 --> 02:52.871
an assassination attempt

02:52.873 --> 02:54.239
at your engagement party.

02:54.241 --> 02:55.474
Darnley and I have been

02:55.476 --> 02:56.909
under attack since
before we met.

02:56.911 --> 02:59.511
By Elizabeth, John Knox,
the Protestants,

02:59.513 --> 03:01.346
even some of my own
Catholic lords.

03:01.348 --> 03:02.948
Something is going to happen,
Greer.

03:02.950 --> 03:05.717
I just... don't know where
it's going to come from.

03:05.719 --> 03:06.718
I see why the idea

03:06.720 --> 03:07.920
of running away with Darnley

03:07.922 --> 03:09.521
is suddenly so appealing.

03:09.523 --> 03:11.523
And while I'm checking
over my shoulder

03:11.525 --> 03:12.691
for assassins
and the like,

03:12.693 --> 03:14.326
I still have
the politics

03:14.328 --> 03:15.727
of a royal wedding
to deal with.

03:15.729 --> 03:17.529
The guest list,
the seating chart,

03:17.531 --> 03:18.931
a million little things
that could alienate

03:18.933 --> 03:21.400
my supporters at home.
And you will deal

03:21.402 --> 03:22.935
with those challenges
as you always do.

03:22.937 --> 03:24.670
Except that now,
at the end of the day,

03:24.672 --> 03:26.672
you will have achieved more
than a political alliance.

03:26.674 --> 03:28.440
You will have a chance
to find love again.

03:28.442 --> 03:29.541
Well...

03:29.543 --> 03:30.576
it's almost

03:30.578 --> 03:32.211
too much to
hope for.

03:32.213 --> 03:33.979
But I'm willing to try.

03:38.552 --> 03:40.285
NARCISSE:
We have a problem.

03:40.287 --> 03:41.954
If you're referring
to the fact

03:41.956 --> 03:43.555
that Charles hasn't
been seen in weeks

03:43.557 --> 03:45.624
and he gave his crown
to a peasant,

03:45.626 --> 03:47.426
we don't have a "problem,"
Narcisse.

03:47.428 --> 03:48.894
We have a disaster.

03:48.896 --> 03:50.329
Well, it's about to get
a lot worse.

03:50.331 --> 03:51.563
I've just learned
your daughter,

03:51.565 --> 03:52.898
Leeza, is drafting
a letter

03:52.900 --> 03:53.999
for Charles to sign,

03:54.001 --> 03:55.567
formally abdicating the throne.

03:55.569 --> 03:57.302
If Charles abdicates the throne,
then what?

03:57.304 --> 03:58.971
His brother, Henry,
is next in line.

03:58.973 --> 04:01.306
He's even younger than Charles.
There will be

04:01.308 --> 04:03.942
a vacuum. They'll make their
own bid for the throne,

04:03.944 --> 04:06.778
which will allow
King Philip to take advantage

04:06.780 --> 04:07.879
of the instability

04:07.881 --> 04:08.981
and present Spain

04:08.983 --> 04:10.983
as a better option.

04:10.985 --> 04:13.318
Making France
a Spanish territory.

04:13.320 --> 04:14.319
Yes.

04:14.321 --> 04:17.289
Charles's absence buys us time.

04:17.291 --> 04:18.657
He can't sign anything

04:18.659 --> 04:20.592
if his whereabouts are unknown.
(sighs)

04:20.594 --> 04:21.793
Leeza has her Spanish guards

04:21.795 --> 04:23.395
combing the countryside
as we speak.

04:23.397 --> 04:24.997
Then we must find him first.

04:24.999 --> 04:27.733
Yes.
My sources told me
of a family outside Meaux.

04:27.735 --> 04:29.901
They recently took
in a mysterious boarder.

04:29.903 --> 04:31.470
Maybe it's Charles.

04:31.472 --> 04:32.804
I will go at once.

04:32.806 --> 04:34.906
Uh, Catherine...

04:35.843 --> 04:37.276
Charles didn't just run away

04:37.278 --> 04:38.510
from his duty.

04:38.512 --> 04:40.712
He also ran away from...

04:40.714 --> 04:42.514
you.

04:42.516 --> 04:44.583
I'm the problem now?

04:44.585 --> 04:46.952
You must admit,
your relationship with Charles

04:46.954 --> 04:48.353
has been strained.

04:48.355 --> 04:49.454
Perhaps Charles
would respond better

04:49.456 --> 04:50.656
to a strong, male

04:50.658 --> 04:52.024
authority figure.

04:52.026 --> 04:53.959
But in the absence
of such a man,

04:53.961 --> 04:55.027
I'll settle for you.

04:55.029 --> 04:56.762
Hmm.

04:56.764 --> 04:58.930
I will hold my tongue
and I'll let you do the talking,

04:58.932 --> 05:01.433
but rest assured,
I am the right person

05:01.435 --> 05:03.935
to bring Charles home.

05:05.939 --> 05:09.775
There's an unbreakable bond
between a mother and her son.

05:09.777 --> 05:12.544
I can't believe you're taking
my lands for your fiancé.

05:12.546 --> 05:13.779
I have no choice.

05:13.781 --> 05:16.048
It's a requirement
of our marriage.

05:16.050 --> 05:18.417
Darnley must be given
a Scottish title.

05:18.419 --> 05:19.785
That requires me
to grant him lands

05:19.787 --> 05:21.053
that earn him a certain
amount of income.

05:21.055 --> 05:23.055
And somehow it has
to be my lands.

05:23.057 --> 05:24.690
The old Lennox Estates
are the only lands

05:24.692 --> 05:26.925
that earn enough income
to give Darnley the right title.

05:26.927 --> 05:28.794
And I'm sure this has nothing
to do with the fact

05:28.796 --> 05:31.663
that these are the same lands
taken from Darnley's father

05:31.665 --> 05:33.398
for being a traitor.

05:33.400 --> 05:35.967
I won't deny that erasing
Darnley's family's stigma

05:35.969 --> 05:37.803
is a benefit.

05:37.805 --> 05:39.037
I know it's a loss.

05:39.039 --> 05:40.906
Another loss...
of valuable trade routes,

05:40.908 --> 05:42.407
of money out of my pocket.

05:42.409 --> 05:43.809
I will compensate you.
Will you compensate me

05:43.811 --> 05:46.411
for the political allies
I've given up?

05:46.413 --> 05:47.913
Or for my position at court,

05:47.915 --> 05:50.682
which Darnley has already
declared redundant?

05:50.684 --> 05:52.651
He even took my favorite
Arabian stallion.

05:52.653 --> 05:54.353
Will you compensate me
for that, as well?

05:55.089 --> 05:57.122
Nothing that has been done

05:57.124 --> 05:58.824
was meant to harm you
personally.

05:58.826 --> 06:00.092
And I didn't realize

06:00.094 --> 06:01.460
he had taken your horse.

06:01.462 --> 06:02.627
I will talk to him about it.

06:02.629 --> 06:04.396
It's not about the horse.

06:04.398 --> 06:05.731
It's that I don't like

06:05.733 --> 06:07.032
making sacrifices for someone

06:07.034 --> 06:08.400
who isn't worthy of you
to begin with.

06:08.402 --> 06:09.568
He only came here

06:09.570 --> 06:11.670
to promote his power,
not yours.

06:11.672 --> 06:14.973
He set fire to a building
so he could look like a hero.

06:14.975 --> 06:16.441
Darnley's a better man
than you think.

06:16.443 --> 06:17.476
Really?

06:17.478 --> 06:18.643
Who told you that?

06:22.483 --> 06:23.565
Darnley?

06:23.566 --> 06:24.648
You forged a letter to end
my relationship with Keira.

06:24.651 --> 06:26.385
How could you do this?
It wasn't easy.

06:26.387 --> 06:27.686
I paid a fortune.

06:28.922 --> 06:30.889
You don't deny it?
How did you find out?

06:30.891 --> 06:33.525
Keira arrived here
from England two days ago,

06:33.527 --> 06:34.726
trapped in a
loveless marriage,

06:34.728 --> 06:35.727
desperate to know

06:35.729 --> 06:37.496
why I abandoned her.

06:37.498 --> 06:38.764
She's here?
Please, tell me

06:38.766 --> 06:40.098
that you have not slept
with her.

06:40.100 --> 06:41.666
You have ruined any chance

06:41.668 --> 06:43.435
that I had at being happy.

06:43.437 --> 06:44.603
I've ruined nothing.

06:44.605 --> 06:45.737
Your dalliance with Keira

06:45.739 --> 06:46.838
was a foolish passion,

06:46.840 --> 06:47.939
a distraction keeping you

06:47.941 --> 06:49.508
from your true destiny

06:49.510 --> 06:51.543
as king of Scotland,

06:51.545 --> 06:53.044
and some day,
perhaps, of England.

06:53.046 --> 06:55.180
I loved her.

06:55.182 --> 06:56.915
I was heartbroken
when I thought

06:56.917 --> 06:58.884
that she had rejected me.

07:00.954 --> 07:03.989
She was the love of my life.

07:03.991 --> 07:06.124
And you've taken that from me.

07:06.126 --> 07:07.726
For your own good.

07:07.728 --> 07:10.862
My son, you must put
the past behind you.

07:10.864 --> 07:11.863
Keira is married.

07:11.865 --> 07:14.566
You are engaged to a queen.

07:14.568 --> 07:15.634
Do you think I don't know that?

07:15.636 --> 07:17.502
This isn't easy.

07:17.504 --> 07:20.605
I care for Mary, too.

07:20.607 --> 07:23.041
I don't want to lose what this
marriage means to either of us.

07:23.043 --> 07:25.544
Then don't.

07:27.014 --> 07:28.480
Where is Keira now?

07:28.482 --> 07:31.049
She's in an inn in the village

07:31.051 --> 07:33.018
until I can decide what to do.

07:33.020 --> 07:36.488
There is no decision to be made.

07:36.490 --> 07:37.756
If you continue
with this relationship

07:37.758 --> 07:38.790
and Keira's husband

07:38.792 --> 07:40.459
finds out that she was here,

07:40.461 --> 07:42.928
he will have her jailed
for adultery.

07:42.930 --> 07:45.197
And your fiancée,
the queen of Scotland,

07:45.199 --> 07:48.934
will be humiliated
before the entire world

07:48.936 --> 07:51.503
and this marriage

Oh, excuse me,
Your Majesty.

08:20.234 --> 08:22.200
I've just come
from the kitchen.

08:22.202 --> 08:24.536
Agatha asked for blueberry pie,

08:24.538 --> 08:28.640
her favorite. Then I remembered
blueberries are out of season.

08:28.642 --> 08:30.175
Well, at least
she's feeling better.

08:30.177 --> 08:31.560

08:31.561 --> 08:32.944

to the pain medication.

08:32.946 --> 08:34.946
The court physician
said it's temporary,

08:34.948 --> 08:36.681
of course.

08:36.683 --> 08:38.683

as painless as possible, but...

09:41.014 --> 09:42.113
One of the best things

09:42.115 --> 09:43.982
about being queen
is that your subjects

09:43.984 --> 09:45.283
must obey your
every command.

09:45.285 --> 09:46.885
Does that include my father?

09:46.887 --> 09:48.153
Absolutely.

Your father has been

09:49.256 --> 09:51.156
a loyal servant
of the crown.

09:51.158 --> 09:52.891
Your wish is his command.

10:45.879 --> 10:47.412

10:47.414 --> 10:49.147
I had to take the lands
from James.

I've never been
off this farm,

17:56.743 --> 17:59.143
so the stories he tells
sound wonderful to me.

17:59.145 --> 18:00.778
Sometimes we stay up all night
talking about it.

18:00.780 --> 18:03.648
You stay up all night
talking with the king?

18:03.650 --> 18:06.084
I'm sorry, what did
you say your name was?

18:06.086 --> 18:07.718
Nicole.

18:07.720 --> 18:10.188
CATHERINE: Well, you seem
to have quite a bond

18:10.190 --> 18:12.490
with my son, Nicole.
Oh, yes.

18:12.492 --> 18:15.726
If he were to leave,
I'd miss him so much.

18:15.728 --> 18:18.262
Well, you...
you wouldn't have to.

18:18.264 --> 18:21.132
If you could convince Charles
to return with us as king,

18:21.134 --> 18:23.234
then we'd happily
bring you along.

18:23.236 --> 18:24.268
Really?

18:24.270 --> 18:26.270
That would be
a dream come true.

18:26.272 --> 18:27.872
Um...

18:27.874 --> 18:30.408
Give me a moment to talk to him.

18:30.410 --> 18:32.477
(laughter)

18:34.214 --> 18:36.414
NARCISSE: Looks like
the king's been using his hands

18:36.416 --> 18:38.149
to work more than
just the earth.

18:38.151 --> 18:40.384
No wonder he's better.

18:40.386 --> 18:41.652
Perhaps.

18:41.654 --> 18:43.254
But it'll take more than a tryst

18:43.256 --> 18:45.156
with a farm girl
to make Charles capable

18:45.158 --> 18:46.424
of convincing Leeza

18:46.426 --> 18:48.693
he is fit to be king.
(door closes)

18:48.695 --> 18:50.761
After having full run
of the castle all day today,

18:50.763 --> 18:52.830
I can't imagine what you're
going to dream about tonight.

18:52.832 --> 18:55.633
My favorite part was splashing
in the fountain.

18:55.635 --> 18:57.502
(chuckles)
I liked jumping on the beds.

18:57.504 --> 18:59.837
I'm not sure why I don't
do that more often.

19:00.673 --> 19:02.707
Agatha.

19:02.709 --> 19:04.442
Did you take this?
I saw it

19:04.444 --> 19:06.677
on that big map when
we were playing hide and seek.

19:06.679 --> 19:08.379
There were so many boats,
I didn't think

19:08.381 --> 19:09.714
they'd miss just one.

19:09.716 --> 19:11.449
Darling, these aren't toys.

19:11.451 --> 19:14.719
They're meant to represent
real warships in position

19:14.721 --> 19:17.321
to protect England.
Some were aimed at Scotland.

19:17.323 --> 19:18.890
Will you use them
to fight Queen Mary?

19:18.892 --> 19:21.259
Only if necessary.

19:21.261 --> 19:22.793
Mary's so nice.
Did she hurt you?

19:22.795 --> 19:26.464
No, not directly. Not yet.

19:26.466 --> 19:28.199
Agatha met Mary in France.

19:28.201 --> 19:31.536
You see, real queens
sometimes

19:31.538 --> 19:33.237
have very difficult decisions
to make,

19:33.239 --> 19:34.639
whether they
want to or not.

19:34.641 --> 19:35.940
I thought queens
didn't have to do

19:35.942 --> 19:37.508
anything they don't want.

19:37.510 --> 19:40.478
Darling...
It's not quite that simple.

19:40.480 --> 19:42.346
For example,

19:42.348 --> 19:45.349
even a queen must go to
bed when it's very late.

19:45.351 --> 19:48.619
If I were queen, I'd want
everyone to live in peace.

19:48.621 --> 19:51.556
Then you would be
a wise ruler indeed.

19:53.226 --> 19:54.625
(chuckles softly)

19:54.627 --> 19:57.361
Good night.

19:58.765 --> 20:00.364
Your Majesty,

20:00.366 --> 20:01.966
I have news that
couldn't wait.

20:01.968 --> 20:03.701
What is it?

20:03.703 --> 20:05.636
I found what you requested:
reason to take

20:05.638 --> 20:07.638
military action
against Scotland.

20:07.640 --> 20:09.974
There was a recent border
skirmish, not an uncommon event,

20:09.976 --> 20:12.777
but in this case,
English blood was drawn.

20:12.779 --> 20:15.446
Scotland would appear
to be the aggressor.

20:15.448 --> 20:17.848
A justifiable reason
for us to strike back.

20:17.850 --> 20:19.517
And our best
chance to stop

20:19.519 --> 20:21.752
Queen Mary once and for all.

20:23.423 --> 20:25.389
Let me know when the
troops are in position.

20:25.391 --> 20:26.524
On my order,

20:26.526 --> 20:28.492
England will invade.

20:29.562 --> 20:31.796
JAMES:
You wanted to see me?

20:31.798 --> 20:34.398
I have good news for you. I have
found a way to compensate you

20:34.400 --> 20:36.801
for your loss of the trade
routes on the Lennox Estate.

20:36.803 --> 20:38.336
I am getting you the use

20:38.338 --> 20:40.404
of a port owned by a man

20:40.406 --> 20:42.673
called Lord Bothwell.
I know Bothwell.

20:42.675 --> 20:45.409
Did he agree to this?
Well, no.

20:45.411 --> 20:46.877
Not yet.
I summoned him to court,

20:46.879 --> 20:49.347
but he sent word that he was
too ill to travel at the moment.

20:49.349 --> 20:50.815
Did he?

20:50.817 --> 20:53.751
I think I might know
where he's recuperating.

20:53.753 --> 20:55.286
MAN:
Go around the market!

20:55.288 --> 20:56.420
(horse whinnies)

20:56.422 --> 20:57.555
(dog barking)

20:57.557 --> 20:59.557
(indistinct chatter)

20:59.559 --> 21:01.025
If you're looking
for Lord Bothwell,

21:01.027 --> 21:03.294
you'll find him
in that tavern.

21:03.296 --> 21:05.596
He's not ill,
although he might be drunk.

21:05.598 --> 21:07.298
Are you saying
that he lied to me?

21:07.300 --> 21:09.500
Another of his fine qualities.
Huh!

21:09.502 --> 21:11.002
If you're trying to prove
your support to me,

21:11.004 --> 21:13.638
don't expect Bothwell's help.
He's no gentleman.

21:13.640 --> 21:16.707
Although, I must say you
have consistent taste in men.

21:16.709 --> 21:18.009
We should have
invited Darnley along.

21:18.011 --> 21:19.010
He likes taverns, too.

21:19.012 --> 21:21.412
Darnley is riding all day.

21:21.414 --> 21:22.613
And you're wrong about him,

21:22.615 --> 21:25.583
James.
MAN: Lord Moray.

21:25.585 --> 21:26.751
May I have a word?

21:26.753 --> 21:28.586
Go on, James.

21:28.588 --> 21:30.955
I can manage Lord
Bothwell by myself.

21:30.957 --> 21:32.757
What is it?

21:32.759 --> 21:34.592
After the English assassin,
you asked us too keep an eye out

21:34.594 --> 21:36.661
for suspicious activity.
And?

21:36.663 --> 21:39.697
We found something
at the village inn.

21:45.672 --> 21:47.505
A traveler from England
arrived a few nights ago.

21:47.507 --> 21:49.707
Someone registered a room

21:49.709 --> 21:51.659
at the inn
using forged papers.

21:51.660 --> 21:53.610
Do you want me to gather
more men and search the rooms?

21:53.613 --> 21:55.846
Actually, I think I ought
to look into this myself.

22:00.887 --> 22:02.853
(horse nickers)

22:02.855 --> 22:04.755
Hello, boy.

22:04.757 --> 22:06.424
Nice to see you again.

22:11.931 --> 22:13.531
(gasps)
James.

22:13.533 --> 22:14.598
I-I...

22:26.579 --> 22:27.528
James.

22:27.529 --> 22:28.478
I have nothing to say to you.

22:28.481 --> 22:29.580
That wasn't what
it looked like.

22:29.582 --> 22:30.614
That girl, she means
something to me.

22:30.616 --> 22:32.016
You can't tell Mary.
I warned her

22:32.018 --> 22:34.719
about what kind of man you are,
but she wouldn't hear it.

22:34.721 --> 22:36.354
She insisted on proving
herself to me, instead.

22:36.356 --> 22:38.356
Because she thinks we can
be happy and as long

22:38.358 --> 22:40.024
as she doesn't find out
about this, maybe we can.

22:40.026 --> 22:42.360
Don't pretend you care
about Mary's feelings.

22:42.362 --> 22:43.861
You only care about yourself.

22:43.863 --> 22:45.629
I won't let you hurt her.

22:45.631 --> 22:47.631
If you tell Mary, you will be
the one that hurts her.

22:47.633 --> 22:49.133
Not because she'll feel
betrayed, but because

22:49.135 --> 22:52.503
this marriage is the one chance
she has to defeat Elizabeth.

22:52.505 --> 22:55.139
We both know that Mary
isn't safe until she takes

22:55.141 --> 22:56.640
Elizabeth's throne.
Well, marrying me is

22:56.642 --> 22:59.043
the most direct route,
and the key to her survival.

22:59.045 --> 23:01.679
Even if that were true,
I can't stand by

23:01.681 --> 23:03.013
while you carry on
an affair.

23:03.015 --> 23:04.382
Then I'll end it.

23:04.384 --> 23:06.984
You have my word.

23:09.155 --> 23:10.554
You know I'm right.

23:10.556 --> 23:12.790
You don't have a choice.

23:14.727 --> 23:17.628
Fine. I'll keep
your secret this time.

23:17.630 --> 23:19.163
But if you betray
my sister again,

23:19.165 --> 23:22.933
you will pay with your life.

23:37.784 --> 23:39.917
Your Majesty.
Lord Dunbar,

23:39.919 --> 23:41.685
Lord Fenton,
Lord Macdowall.

23:41.687 --> 23:42.887
And you must be
Lord Bothwell.

23:42.889 --> 23:45.923
Too ill to stand?

23:45.925 --> 23:47.858
I was in the middle of a
good hand, Your Majesty.

23:47.860 --> 23:51.462
Oh, then by all means
don't let me interrupt.

23:51.464 --> 23:52.830
Surely one of you gentlemen

23:52.832 --> 23:54.665
can beat a three flush?

23:54.667 --> 23:58.035
Well... it appears I've
just ran out of luck.

24:04.010 --> 24:06.510
How can I help you,
Your Majesty?

24:06.512 --> 24:08.112
I'll be brief.

24:08.114 --> 24:10.514
I need you to give my brother
James access to your port.

24:10.516 --> 24:12.683
I don't give anyone anything.

24:12.685 --> 24:13.717
I'm a businessman.

24:13.719 --> 24:15.219
Though I am curious to know

24:15.221 --> 24:17.855
why Lord Moray needs
my port when he controls

24:17.857 --> 24:19.790
the trade routes on
the old Lennox estate.

24:19.792 --> 24:21.592
Those lands are being returned
to Lord Darnley.

24:21.594 --> 24:23.661
Ah, yes, the
ambitious foreigner

24:23.663 --> 24:25.796
that you seem so
determined to marry.

24:25.798 --> 24:27.465
Although you shouldn't.

24:27.467 --> 24:29.200
You sound like James.

24:29.202 --> 24:30.868
I don't like your brother,
but in this case

24:30.870 --> 24:32.603
I'm inclined
to agree with him.

24:32.605 --> 24:34.472
I didn't come here to ask
for your marital advice.

24:34.474 --> 24:37.107
Lord Moray needs to find
a new way to move his goods.

24:37.109 --> 24:40.578
The Crown will
compensate you, of course.

24:40.580 --> 24:42.179
How much?

24:43.549 --> 24:45.115
The Crown is willing
to pay five percent

24:45.117 --> 24:47.218
of the trade profits--
that should be fair.

24:47.220 --> 24:48.953
Make it 25%.

24:48.955 --> 24:52.022
That's more than fair.

24:52.024 --> 24:54.592
Fine. Do we have a deal?

24:54.594 --> 24:56.494
Now that I think
about it, no.

24:56.496 --> 24:58.729
No?
What do you mean no?

24:58.731 --> 25:00.831
That port has great
sentimental value to me.

25:00.833 --> 25:02.132
It was given to me
by your mother,

25:02.134 --> 25:04.902
Marie de Guise,
for services rendered.

25:04.904 --> 25:07.004
To honor her memory, I couldn't
bargain it away for any price.

25:07.006 --> 25:09.039
So our negotiation has
just been a waste of my time.

25:09.041 --> 25:10.774
Not at all.

25:10.776 --> 25:13.777
My friends here have trade
routes of their own.

25:13.779 --> 25:16.046
And now that they know how much
you're willing to pay for them,

25:16.048 --> 25:17.681
I'm sure they'd be
delighted to negotiate.

25:17.683 --> 25:20.184
I believe the starting
price was 25%.

25:20.186 --> 25:21.185
I'll take 30.

25:21.187 --> 25:22.720
(chuckling)

25:25.691 --> 25:27.625
(royal trumpet fanfare)

25:36.202 --> 25:38.002
(indistinct greetings)

25:45.611 --> 25:49.013
Did Queen Agatha enjoy
her royal carriage ride?

25:49.015 --> 25:50.281
She loved it.

25:50.283 --> 25:51.549
She only wants to travel

25:51.551 --> 25:53.083
by parade from now on.

25:53.085 --> 25:54.285
I'm sorry you
couldn't join us.

25:54.287 --> 25:56.120
So am I.
I've been in meetings

25:56.122 --> 25:58.289
with Ambassador Richards
all morning.

25:58.291 --> 26:00.691
About Scotland. I know
I've been occupied,

26:00.693 --> 26:02.226
but as your advisor,
I strong--
Don't.

26:02.228 --> 26:04.862
You have enough
on your mind.

26:04.864 --> 26:06.230
Agatha, where's your doll?

26:06.232 --> 26:07.998
I gave it to
the kitchen girl.

26:08.000 --> 26:09.099
She's never had a doll.

26:09.101 --> 26:10.834
That was very generous of you.

26:10.836 --> 26:13.737
I'm not going to need it
for much longer.

26:13.739 --> 26:16.273
What's it going to be like
when I'm gone from here?

26:16.275 --> 26:18.809
Oh, darling, we're not
going anywhere.

26:18.811 --> 26:20.811
From this earth, I mean.

26:20.813 --> 26:23.113
Agatha, I, um...

26:23.115 --> 26:25.015
I can't, um... I can't...

26:25.851 --> 26:27.084
As you know,

26:27.086 --> 26:28.852
queens are chosen by God,

26:28.854 --> 26:30.020
so I happen to know

26:30.022 --> 26:31.922
heaven is a
beautiful place.

26:31.924 --> 26:33.724
Much better than any castle.

26:33.726 --> 26:37.294
It's filled with wonderful
food and dancing.

26:37.296 --> 26:38.862
And you mother will be there.

26:38.864 --> 26:41.098
And she will pick you up
and hold you tight

26:41.100 --> 26:42.833
and never let you go.

26:42.835 --> 26:44.101
And once you are with her,

26:44.103 --> 26:46.103
nothing can ever hurt you.

26:46.105 --> 26:47.838
And you will never

26:47.840 --> 26:50.841
feel afraid or alone again.

26:50.843 --> 26:53.077
And even though you can't
see your father,

26:53.079 --> 26:55.746
you will feel
how much he loves you.

26:55.748 --> 26:59.817
And that will never change.

27:14.934 --> 27:17.001
LEEZA:
So, you don't drink blood

27:17.003 --> 27:19.903
or hunt children
in the woods at night?

27:19.905 --> 27:21.772
(scoffs)
Those were ugly rumors

27:21.774 --> 27:23.207
started by peasants.

27:23.209 --> 27:25.309
You ran away,
disappeared for weeks.

27:25.311 --> 27:27.044
Admit it, Charles,

27:27.046 --> 27:28.312
your mind is week,
you cannot handle

27:28.314 --> 27:30.047
the pressures of being king.

27:30.049 --> 27:31.649
Your brother was just
going through a difficult time.

27:31.651 --> 27:32.816
CHARLES:
It's all right.

27:34.220 --> 27:37.054
I did run from court,
and from my responsibility.

27:37.056 --> 27:38.656
Being king was more daunting

27:38.658 --> 27:40.090
than I anticipated.

27:40.092 --> 27:43.327
But after rest and reflection,
I found the truth.

27:43.329 --> 27:45.362
Being king of France
is a duty

27:45.364 --> 27:47.765
I was born to.

27:47.767 --> 27:49.767
I accept who I am
and I will not abdicate.

27:49.769 --> 27:53.837
Spoken like France's
one true king.

27:53.839 --> 27:55.205
Or a well-coached puppet.
CATHERINE: Leeza!

27:55.207 --> 27:57.041
I won't be lied to
again, Mother.

27:57.043 --> 27:58.208
This is a cover-up,
and you're behind it.

27:58.210 --> 27:59.343
I know how you work.

27:59.345 --> 28:00.944
Charles is not fit
to be king,

28:00.946 --> 28:02.346
and if none of you
will admit it,

28:02.348 --> 28:04.048
I'll bring the Vatican in
as judge.

28:04.050 --> 28:06.083
The pope himself can decide
who should rule France.

28:06.085 --> 28:07.217
How dare you threaten

28:07.219 --> 28:09.186
my country
or my reign!

28:09.188 --> 28:11.021
You have no power over me.

28:11.023 --> 28:12.356
Neither does
the Catholic Church.

28:12.358 --> 28:14.024
That is blasphemy.

28:14.026 --> 28:16.326
It would be
if I were Catholic...

28:17.730 --> 28:18.829
...which I'm not.

28:18.831 --> 28:21.031
Charles?
What are you saying?

28:21.033 --> 28:22.399
I'm saying

28:22.401 --> 28:24.935
that I, Charles de Valois,
King of France,

28:24.937 --> 28:27.304
am a Protestant.

28:30.209 --> 28:32.476
He's a heretic?!

28:32.478 --> 28:34.044
A Protestant?

28:34.046 --> 28:35.779
Are you insane?!
No.

28:35.781 --> 28:37.114
For the first time
in a long time,

28:37.116 --> 28:38.782
I am healthy and clear-minded.

28:38.784 --> 28:40.317
Thanks to Nicole
and her family.

28:40.319 --> 28:42.086
Their faith is
a source of strength.

28:42.088 --> 28:43.754
This is your fault.
I should have
your entire family

28:43.756 --> 28:45.222
burned at the stake.

28:45.224 --> 28:47.424
I don't understand.
Charles is king.

28:47.426 --> 28:48.826
I thought he could practice
any faith he wants.

28:48.828 --> 28:50.994
I can.
Henry VIII broke from Rome

28:50.996 --> 28:53.163
and freed England
of Vatican Oppression.

28:53.165 --> 28:54.465
Under my rule,
I will lead France

28:54.467 --> 28:56.200
to a new golden age.

28:56.202 --> 28:57.835
You're not Henry VIII.

28:57.837 --> 28:59.103
And France is not England.

28:59.105 --> 29:00.971
When England broke
from the Catholic Church,

29:00.973 --> 29:04.041
it wasn't reliant
on Rome or Spain

29:04.043 --> 29:05.876
for financial aid, France is.

29:05.878 --> 29:09.379
Not to mention, most of your
nobles and your privy council

29:09.381 --> 29:12.816
are devout Catholics,
myself included.

29:12.818 --> 29:15.419
Even our personal income depends
on nobles, Catholic nobles.

29:15.421 --> 29:17.254
If you think for one moment
they will stand by

29:17.256 --> 29:20.090
while a Protestant king
bankrupts this country...

29:20.092 --> 29:22.359
As Lord Chancellor, the man
who holds the purse strings,

29:22.361 --> 29:25.028
I can guarantee you
that will not happen.

29:25.030 --> 29:27.397
You need to go to your sister
immediately and recant.

29:27.399 --> 29:29.500
I'm sorry, I will not lie
about my beliefs.

29:29.502 --> 29:31.301
Not to the queen
of Spain or anyone.

29:31.303 --> 29:33.403
You asked me to return
to the throne, and I did.

29:33.405 --> 29:36.173
A Protestant king.

29:36.175 --> 29:38.842
What my sister Leeza thinks
is of no consequence to me.

29:38.844 --> 29:41.145
You will tear
this country apart.

29:41.147 --> 29:43.781
If that's the price
of progress,

29:43.783 --> 29:44.848
so be it.

29:55.928 --> 29:58.262
James, there you are.

29:58.264 --> 30:01.265
I have in my hand
papers that grant you

30:01.267 --> 30:04.535
access to new trade routes that
more than make up for your loss.

30:06.305 --> 30:08.472
Well, I'm sorry
for your trouble.

30:08.474 --> 30:10.541
Is that all you have to say?
Are you actually

30:10.543 --> 30:12.442
disappointed that I've
resolved this issue?

30:12.444 --> 30:15.145
No. In fact,
I'm grateful to you

30:15.147 --> 30:17.181
for having gone to such
great lengths on my behalf.

30:17.183 --> 30:19.583
But your issue was not
with my generosity,

30:19.585 --> 30:22.352
but, rather,
Darnley's character.

30:22.354 --> 30:23.954
And so you are
still not satisfied.

30:23.956 --> 30:28.325
Mary, I know that Darnley
offers you many things.

30:28.327 --> 30:30.227
An heir, a chance
at the English throne,

30:30.229 --> 30:31.562
but I-I still don't think
he can give you

30:31.564 --> 30:33.096
the one thing you truly deserve.

30:34.233 --> 30:35.966
Happiness.

30:39.205 --> 30:41.905
Leeza, please don't do this.

30:41.907 --> 30:43.974
There's no need
to rush back to Spain

30:43.976 --> 30:45.375
or to involve King Philip.

30:45.377 --> 30:46.610
This is a family matter.

30:46.612 --> 30:48.512
Charles is young.

30:48.514 --> 30:50.380
It's probably just a phase.

30:50.382 --> 30:52.482
Protestantism is not a phase.

30:52.484 --> 30:55.252
It is a disease,
and Spain is the cure.

30:55.254 --> 30:57.454
And what would you have
Spain do?

30:57.456 --> 31:00.190
Forcibly remove your own
brother from the throne?

31:00.192 --> 31:02.993
If necessary, yes.

31:02.995 --> 31:05.963
Well, do you think that's wise?

31:05.965 --> 31:09.132
France has a sizeable
Protestant population,

31:09.134 --> 31:10.868
and if they learn
that a Catholic nation

31:10.870 --> 31:13.003
is trying to remove
their Protestant king,

31:13.005 --> 31:15.873
you will have started
a civil war.

31:15.875 --> 31:17.441
Don't threaten me, Mother.

31:17.443 --> 31:19.209
It's your responsibility.

31:19.211 --> 31:22.279
It always has been.

31:22.281 --> 31:23.547
We both know that
you didn't come here

31:23.549 --> 31:26.149
to promote Catholicism.

31:26.151 --> 31:28.452
You came to punish me.
And why shouldn't I?

31:28.454 --> 31:30.554
It's not as if
you don't deserve it.

31:30.556 --> 31:32.956
You're right.

31:32.958 --> 31:34.625
I have failed you.

31:34.627 --> 31:36.326
You needed something
I couldn't give.

31:36.328 --> 31:38.028
What do you want
from me now?

31:38.030 --> 31:39.429
You want me to do
all things that I didn't

31:39.431 --> 31:40.631
do for you when you were
a child.

31:40.633 --> 31:42.099
Do you want me
to comb your hair?

31:42.101 --> 31:43.166
Do you want me
to sing you to sleep?

31:43.168 --> 31:44.234
Do you want me
to love you more?

31:44.236 --> 31:46.169
If I could go back in time

31:46.171 --> 31:48.372
and be a better parent, I would.

31:48.374 --> 31:50.574
I would change so many things.

31:50.576 --> 31:52.242
It wouldn't matter.

31:52.244 --> 31:53.644
Nothing can make up

31:53.646 --> 31:56.113
for the sins of your past.

31:56.115 --> 31:58.482
Then don't punish all of France
when you want to punish me.

31:58.484 --> 32:00.250
Tell me what I can do now,

32:00.252 --> 32:02.286
today, to make things right.

32:06.191 --> 32:08.325
Do you know how expensive

32:08.327 --> 32:09.393
your bed sheets are?

32:09.395 --> 32:10.460
NARCISSE:
Nicole.

32:10.462 --> 32:12.663
One silk pillowcase costs

32:12.665 --> 32:14.665
more than my father
earns in a month.

32:14.667 --> 32:18.302
If you're looking for Charles,
you're in the wrong room.

32:18.304 --> 32:19.636
His bed sheets

32:19.638 --> 32:21.305
are very nice, too.

32:21.307 --> 32:23.040
I know exactly whose
room I'm in.

32:23.042 --> 32:24.641
Charles is a lovely boy,

32:24.643 --> 32:26.410
and being with the king
has its perks.

32:26.412 --> 32:28.145
But now that I know

32:28.147 --> 32:30.213
how things really
work around here,

32:30.215 --> 32:33.717
I'm interested in getting
to know you better.

32:33.719 --> 32:35.185
I don't blame you.

32:35.187 --> 32:37.187
I am a fascinating man.

32:37.189 --> 32:38.455
But the question is,

32:38.457 --> 32:42.192
why should I
be interested in you?

32:42.194 --> 32:43.660
Because the king
still listens to me.

32:43.662 --> 32:45.329
I could...

32:45.331 --> 32:48.498
persuade him to listen to you.

32:48.500 --> 32:51.635
And that could be useful.

32:51.637 --> 32:53.070
But you'll have to make it
worth my while.

32:53.072 --> 32:54.438
Hmm.
I need gold,

32:54.440 --> 32:56.340
and lots of it.

32:56.342 --> 32:58.976
But if I ask the king, the
privy council would object.

32:58.978 --> 33:00.177
So...

33:00.179 --> 33:01.979
I'm turning to you.

33:01.981 --> 33:04.247
You're a fast learner.
I am.

33:04.249 --> 33:06.316
I know all kinds of things.

33:15.694 --> 33:17.194
(door opens)

33:18.530 --> 33:20.564
Agatha's sleeping.

33:20.566 --> 33:23.400
She is exhausted.

33:23.402 --> 33:25.402
By the looks of it, so are you.

33:25.404 --> 33:27.137
(soft chuckle)

33:27.139 --> 33:28.538
Thank you.

33:28.540 --> 33:30.007
For making Agatha happy,

33:30.009 --> 33:32.142
for comforting her
when I had no words.

33:32.144 --> 33:34.745
I wish there
was more I could do.

33:36.115 --> 33:39.149
That picture
you painted of heaven.

33:39.151 --> 33:41.284
Your words tumbled out
so easily,

33:41.286 --> 33:42.552
the specifics so vivid,
you didn't even give it

33:42.554 --> 33:44.021
a second thought.

33:44.023 --> 33:46.456
It's because
it's what you told

33:46.458 --> 33:49.159
yourself as a child, isn't it?

33:49.161 --> 33:51.528
My father wanted
little to do with me.

33:51.530 --> 33:56.166
My mother was killed
before I turned three.

33:56.168 --> 34:01.038
Later, they locked me
in the Tower.

34:01.040 --> 34:04.074
They accused me of treason,

34:04.076 --> 34:06.376
and I never knew if they
were coming for me next.

34:09.048 --> 34:12.549
I grew up with a sword hanging
over my head,

34:12.551 --> 34:18.255
aware at any moment
I could be slain.

34:18.257 --> 34:22.526
So I told myself that story...

34:22.528 --> 34:24.294
so I wouldn't be afraid.

34:25.464 --> 34:29.299
You've faced death
your whole life.

34:29.301 --> 34:31.802
It can't help but
to have shaped you.

34:31.804 --> 34:34.104
Even as queen.

34:34.106 --> 34:38.642
But now, I look at Agatha...

34:38.644 --> 34:43.814
facing death with such
strength and courage.

34:43.816 --> 34:48.351
And I wonder, can I ever
be that strong?

34:48.353 --> 34:50.120
Elizabeth, you are

34:50.122 --> 34:53.790
that strong, and you have
more courage than you know.

34:53.792 --> 34:57.427
Enough courage to face what
must feel like certain death

34:57.429 --> 34:59.362
and still make
the right decision.

34:59.364 --> 35:00.430
Let's hope you're right.

35:14.313 --> 35:16.213
You won't be climbing trees
in it,

35:16.215 --> 35:20.217
but your wedding dress
will be beautiful.

35:20.219 --> 35:21.618
You don't seem happy.

35:21.620 --> 35:23.753
Oh, I am happy, mostly.

35:23.755 --> 35:26.356
Gave Darnley back
his lands and titles,

35:26.358 --> 35:28.892
and I salvaged the
situation with James.

35:28.894 --> 35:30.327
But there's something
about our conversation

35:30.329 --> 35:32.295
that bothers me, it's like he...

35:32.297 --> 35:34.364
knew something he wasn't saying.

35:34.366 --> 35:35.899
Mary, James sees his sister
marrying someone

35:35.901 --> 35:37.601
he doesn't approve of.
Can you blame him

35:37.603 --> 35:39.236
for seeming less
than enthusiastic?

35:39.238 --> 35:41.471
I suppose I should be thankful

35:41.473 --> 35:44.774
I have a brother who cares
enough to worry about me.

35:44.776 --> 35:46.776
(door opens)

35:46.778 --> 35:48.678
A letter for Queen Mary.

35:49.781 --> 35:52.649
(door opens and closes)

35:52.651 --> 35:54.518
Another warning from
the Loyal Watchman.

35:54.520 --> 35:55.919
Every time he writes,
he speaks the truth.

35:55.921 --> 35:57.721
But it's never been good news.

36:02.461 --> 36:04.661
(laughter and indistinct
conversations)

36:07.933 --> 36:10.400
I don't understand.

36:10.402 --> 36:12.235
ELIZABETH:
It's quite simple, Ambassador.

36:12.237 --> 36:14.638
I've changed my mind.
But the troops

36:14.640 --> 36:17.174
are positioned, they only await
your word for the invasion

36:17.176 --> 36:19.342
to begin.
Your Majesty,

36:19.344 --> 36:20.744
this chance may not come again.

36:21.847 --> 36:24.548
Ambassador Richards,

36:24.550 --> 36:26.183
were you afraid of
the dark as a child?

36:26.185 --> 36:28.185
I believe I was.

36:28.187 --> 36:30.287
And are you still
afraid of the dark?

36:30.289 --> 36:31.488
Of course not.
Exactly.

36:31.490 --> 36:32.822
It would be foolish

36:32.824 --> 36:34.824
to let our childhood fear

36:34.826 --> 36:36.860
govern us as adults.

36:36.862 --> 36:39.963
Mary has made no overt
move against me.

36:39.965 --> 36:41.965
Reacting as though she had
would be the actions

36:41.967 --> 36:44.234
of a scared little girl.

36:45.437 --> 36:47.837
Which I am not.

36:47.839 --> 36:51.308
You tell your men to stand down.

36:51.310 --> 36:54.978
I will not be remembered as
the queen who drew first blood.

36:58.217 --> 37:00.317
Ah, blueberry pie.

37:00.319 --> 37:01.851
Blueberries are out of season,
so I had them

37:01.853 --> 37:03.653
brought in from Portugal.

37:03.655 --> 37:07.591
It turns out a queen actually
can do whatever she wants.

37:48.367 --> 37:53.770
♪ No footsteps in the hall ♪

38:16.061 --> 38:19.296
You know, Mother,
despite all our difficulties,

38:19.298 --> 38:22.399
I trust we've come
to an understanding.

38:22.401 --> 38:25.402
We certainly have.

38:25.404 --> 38:27.470
(bell tolls in the distance)

38:33.845 --> 38:37.314
(horses neigh)

38:37.316 --> 38:39.816
Leeza is finally
returning to Spain?

38:39.818 --> 38:41.951
Yes, the viper
returns to her nest.

38:41.953 --> 38:43.920
NARCISSE: Well, we're not
out of trouble yet.

38:43.922 --> 38:45.388
That farm girl

38:45.390 --> 38:46.923
that Charles is so fond of,

38:46.925 --> 38:48.925
I think she might have her
eye set on something more

38:48.927 --> 38:50.393
than just a day at court.

38:50.395 --> 38:53.396
We may have to get rid of her.

38:53.398 --> 38:54.731
Not yet.

38:54.733 --> 38:57.100
If she has Charles' ear,
we may need her

38:57.102 --> 38:59.002
for the task to come.
What's wrong?

38:59.004 --> 39:01.571
The only way that Leeza has
agreed not to tell Philip

39:01.573 --> 39:04.441
or the Vatican
that Charles is a Protestant

39:04.443 --> 39:07.711
is if I remove Charles from
the throne and replace him

39:07.713 --> 39:10.714
with his very Catholic
brother, Henry.

39:10.716 --> 39:13.750
But Charles has finally
embraced being king.

39:13.752 --> 39:16.019
He's not gonna give up
the throne without a fight,

39:16.021 --> 39:18.588
and if the Protestants
rise to his defense...

39:18.590 --> 39:19.956
There'll be a civil war.

39:19.958 --> 39:24.361
A bloodbath that pits
brother against brother

39:24.363 --> 39:28.631
until one of my sons is dead.

39:28.633 --> 39:32.635
That is my punishment.

39:32.637 --> 39:35.739
If you want to know my opinion
on flowers for the wedding,

39:35.741 --> 39:37.440
I like what you like.

39:37.442 --> 39:40.810
See what a good
husband I'll be?

39:40.812 --> 39:43.079
I wanted to talk to you about
the seating arrangements.

39:43.081 --> 39:44.848
I found out we
have another guest.

39:44.850 --> 39:47.917
Where should we seat
Lady Keira White?

39:49.488 --> 39:51.554
Mary, I don't...

39:51.556 --> 39:53.923
Don't bother trying to deny
you're having an affair.

39:58.096 --> 39:59.996
I'm sorry.

39:59.998 --> 40:02.866
Keira is the love of my
life, and we were torn apart

40:02.868 --> 40:05.001
by a lie.

40:05.003 --> 40:06.803
She's married.

40:06.805 --> 40:08.138
We have no future.

40:08.140 --> 40:09.672
Mine is with you.

40:09.674 --> 40:12.609
James tried
to warn me about you.

40:12.611 --> 40:15.812
He said that you were
selfish and reckless,

40:15.814 --> 40:18.014
and I refused to listen.

40:18.016 --> 40:20.183
Why should I listen to you now?

40:20.185 --> 40:23.987
Apologies are for wives,
and I will never be yours.

40:23.989 --> 40:26.156
You can't seriously be willing
to walk away from this marriage

40:26.158 --> 40:28.124
just to punish me
for one mistake?

40:28.126 --> 40:29.926
Oh, no, the mistake was mine.

40:29.928 --> 40:32.896
For thinking that we could have
more than a political marriage.

40:32.898 --> 40:37.000
I was so stupid to think that
we could find love together.

40:37.002 --> 40:38.134
It was only one time!

40:38.136 --> 40:39.702
Why do you keep saying that

40:39.704 --> 40:41.604
like it makes it better?

40:41.606 --> 40:43.206
I can't trust you.

40:43.208 --> 40:46.509
You have ruined everything
we might have had,

40:46.511 --> 40:48.178
everything we might have been.

40:48.180 --> 40:51.448
I knew that something
or someone

40:51.450 --> 40:53.082
was going to get in the way
of our happiness.

40:53.084 --> 40:56.519
And I was looking in this
corner and that for all the...

40:56.521 --> 40:58.555
the people and the threats

40:58.557 --> 41:00.824
that I was protecting you from.

41:00.826 --> 41:02.492
And all this time,

41:02.494 --> 41:04.027
the enemy was you.

41:04.029 --> 41:06.963
You don't love me.

41:06.965 --> 41:08.631
And I'm willing
to bet you never will.

41:08.633 --> 41:10.166
In your heart
you know that,

41:10.168 --> 41:12.535
so what does it matter?

41:12.537 --> 41:14.504
I'm giving up
the love of my life

41:14.506 --> 41:16.906
to marry you, but if you walk
away from this marriage,

41:16.908 --> 41:18.241
you are giving up much more.

41:18.243 --> 41:22.846
I know you, Mary.

41:24.249 --> 41:25.515
You want England.

41:25.517 --> 41:26.850
You won't,

41:26.852 --> 41:29.052
you can't, let one indiscretion

41:29.054 --> 41:31.654
destroy everything
you've worked for.

41:34.659 --> 41:38.695
If I do marry you,

41:38.697 --> 41:39.863
it will be for
the good of Scotland

41:39.865 --> 41:41.264
and the promise of England,

41:41.266 --> 41:43.600
and nothing more.

41:43.602 --> 41:45.201
You will be my husband
in name only.

41:45.203 --> 41:48.204
And we will never be happy.

41:48.206 --> 41:49.272
And I will never forgive you.
