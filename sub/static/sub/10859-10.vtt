00:03.530 --> 00:06.530
Johnson's military. We can't
just storm in there without clearance. 
Let's go!

00:06.530 --> 00:06.570
Let's go!

00:06.570 --> 00:08.440
Yes, sir, I'm
very well aware of that.
Let's go!

00:08.440 --> 00:08.480
Let's go!

00:08.480 --> 00:10.680
Based on a hunch that she's got an active anomaly.
Let's go!

00:10.680 --> 00:10.780
Let's go!

00:10.780 --> 00:14.420
and some mysterious woman from the
future tucked away somewhere.
Let's go!

00:14.420 --> 00:14.460
Let's go!

00:14.460 --> 00:17.490
- Who are you? Who are you working for?
- I will show you
Let's go!

00:17.490 --> 00:17.520
Let's go!

00:17.520 --> 00:20.040
but first I have to go to the
Anomalies Research Center.
Let's go!

00:20.040 --> 00:20.070
Let's go!

00:20.070 --> 00:21.800
What do you know about the ARC?
Let's go!

00:21.800 --> 00:23.470
Let's go!

00:23.470 --> 00:24.810
Over here!

00:29.210 --> 00:32.560
If you're gonna do something,
now would be a good time.

00:37.100 --> 00:38.950
- What does it say?
- Not much.

00:38.980 --> 00:41.960
"333" here ... here ...

00:42.100 --> 00:43.480
What's going on?

00:47.330 --> 00:49.990
Now give me the artifact or she dies.

00:51.860 --> 00:52.860
No!

00:52.950 --> 00:56.060
- What we gonna do?
- Follow Helen wherever she goes.

00:56.100 --> 00:57.790
... to the the end of
time and if necessary.

00:59.000 --> 01:05.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:02.390 --> 02:04.100
So, what do we go?

02:04.860 --> 02:06.260
Stun grenades.

02:06.370 --> 02:09.580
The future predators have
a hypersensitive hearing.

02:09.620 --> 02:12.150
These should stop them and detect their traps.

02:12.180 --> 02:15.530
- Do you have ear plugs in there?
- Use your fingers.

02:15.560 --> 02:18.030
And if you don't want your eardrums to burst

02:18.060 --> 02:20.460
I suggest you keep your mouth open.

02:20.500 --> 02:23.050
That won't be difficult for Connor.

02:23.970 --> 02:26.700
Not too close
when you throw.

02:26.740 --> 02:29.170
All right, let's do this.

02:35.730 --> 02:36.730
No.

02:36.770 --> 02:39.740
- Not now.
- It's Johnson's HQ.

02:39.770 --> 02:41.180
Do you think it's Helen?

02:41.300 --> 02:42.600
Could be.

02:43.470 --> 02:44.870
We got back there

02:44.910 --> 02:46.970
and we're wrong then ...

02:53.110 --> 02:54.150
Danny.

02:54.720 --> 02:56.430
You have to give us orders.

02:57.520 --> 03:00.270
Well. Becker, you check it out.

03:00.370 --> 03:03.690
Sarah, you go with him.
Abby, Connor, you're with me.

03:04.220 --> 03:07.930
- Wherever she is we'll stop her.
- Danny, I wanna go with you.

03:07.960 --> 03:09.970
Look, I need you to do this for me.

03:10.010 --> 03:13.140
- Yeah but if you don't ...
- Look, no one is saying goodbye here.

03:13.170 --> 03:14.930
Will return all.

03:14.970 --> 03:16.890
Now, once we're through,

03:16.920 --> 03:19.580
you close the anomaly.
It's far too dangerous to leave it open.

03:19.610 --> 03:21.250
Unlock it in two hours.

03:21.290 --> 03:23.000
Danny, here.

03:23.030 --> 03:24.520
And take care.

03:24.970 --> 03:26.230
Unlock it!

03:28.000 --> 03:29.310
- Connor.
- Jo.

03:29.350 --> 03:31.270
You may need this.

03:31.300 --> 03:32.330
Thanks.

04:02.440 --> 04:03.790
Let's get going.

04:03.830 --> 04:07.630
- What about Johnson's people?
- The operation is being closed down.

04:08.400 --> 04:10.220
The place should be empty.
Come on.

04:10.250 --> 04:11.440
Come on.

04:22.130 --> 04:23.850
It doesn't get any prettier, does it?

04:25.060 --> 04:26.760
- You all right?
- Ja.

04:28.110 --> 04:30.140
When I saw Helen,
she was down there.

04:30.180 --> 04:32.250
- By the church.
- Ok.

04:33.260 --> 04:35.760
- Let's go.
- This way.

05:07.000 --> 05:08.260
You see Helen?

05:22.500 --> 05:25.550
So, where is Helen?
Where are all the predators?

05:41.840 --> 05:43.050
Listen.

06:11.840 --> 06:12.860
Go!

06:31.300 --> 06:32.930
No one on the gate there.

06:32.960 --> 06:34.710
Let's hope it's all that easy.

06:34.740 --> 06:36.240
I wouldn't bet on it.

06:44.490 --> 06:46.280
Becker, through here.

06:50.250 --> 06:53.000
This must be Johnson's anomaly.

06:56.120 --> 06:58.860
So where ... where did you see Helen?

06:59.110 --> 07:00.830
She came from over there.

08:35.020 --> 08:36.190
Becker.

08:44.660 --> 08:45.740
Run!

09:03.930 --> 09:05.780
Pull it over the side.

09:31.790 --> 09:33.610
Oh, it stinks.

09:34.870 --> 09:37.420
Why would Helen come here?

09:38.170 --> 09:42.620
If it was me I would find some nice
little Jurassic beach somewhere.

09:45.590 --> 09:48.260
However crazy she was everything she
does makes some kind of sense.

09:48.290 --> 09:49.720
Really?

09:51.600 --> 09:52.900
There're back.

10:00.740 --> 10:01.980
Did you get it?

10:03.870 --> 10:05.450
Apparently not.

10:07.600 --> 10:08.730
I can't hold that here.

10:12.000 --> 10:14.900
We've gotta get something
Keep the door closed.

10:31.140 --> 10:33.940
- Becker is really not gonna be happy with you
- Why?

10:34.370 --> 10:36.550
That was his favorite gun.

10:36.590 --> 10:39.190
We gonna get him a girlfriend.

10:41.210 --> 10:42.310
Oh my God!

10:48.570 --> 10:49.840
We're in the ARC!

11:00.240 --> 11:02.920
Maybe some kinda future version of it.

11:03.540 --> 11:06.030
Helen said, "it started all here".

11:07.050 --> 11:08.510
This must be what she meant.

11:08.540 --> 11:10.500
She's here. I now it.

11:10.610 --> 11:11.640
Come on.

11:33.440 --> 11:34.500
Come on.

11:47.310 --> 11:48.350
Here.

11:57.960 --> 12:01.010
There's no way out.
Becker there's no way out!

12:01.050 --> 12:02.480
I'll call the backup team.

12:02.760 --> 12:05.970
- Tell me exactly where we are.
 It's a big too late for that now.

12:06.000 --> 12:07.920
Oh my God, their coming through it.

12:10.880 --> 12:14.260
Come on. We need to get both of them
on the grill at the same time.

12:14.310 --> 12:15.310
What?

12:15.340 --> 12:17.680
Come on, we've only got one shot of this.

12:18.960 --> 12:20.900
Come on, Sarah. You can do this.

12:22.150 --> 12:23.170
Come on!

12:25.730 --> 12:26.750
Come on!

12:27.680 --> 12:28.710
Come on!

12:29.670 --> 12:31.170
Come on! Now!

12:50.440 --> 12:52.580
Do you think that's the last one of those things?

12:54.080 --> 12:55.500
Let's go to find out.

13:00.490 --> 13:02.000
The anomaly has closed.

13:04.820 --> 13:06.080
Let's get out of here.

13:13.130 --> 13:16.820
That's what Helen used
to control the anomalies.

13:18.350 --> 13:21.080
Looks like it's been dead for a long time.

13:21.110 --> 13:22.810
How do you think it works?

13:23.550 --> 13:25.050
I wish I knew.

13:25.090 --> 13:26.930
- Did you just ...
- Yeah.

13:39.170 --> 13:40.870
Ok, here.

14:36.970 --> 14:38.050
Don't.

14:44.980 --> 14:46.040
Danny ...

14:54.270 --> 14:56.840
Works better on you
that it does on some predators.

15:00.030 --> 15:01.540
Come out of the dark, Connor.

15:05.580 --> 15:07.090
That's it.

15:07.120 --> 15:08.660
Good boy.

15:08.690 --> 15:10.000
You too, Abby.

15:16.280 --> 15:18.110
So you found me.

15:19.640 --> 15:23.320
I am surprised ...
surprised you had brain to figure it out.

15:23.350 --> 15:26.550
Whatever you're up to
it ends now.

15:26.590 --> 15:27.890
Who's gonna stop me?

15:29.280 --> 15:30.540
You and Barbie?

15:31.290 --> 15:32.550
Just watch us.

15:44.870 --> 15:47.120
Nick knew this was important ...

15:48.270 --> 15:50.020
but he didn't know why.

15:51.330 --> 15:53.450
Yeah. But he would have it done.

15:54.300 --> 15:56.100
if you hadn't murdered him!

15:59.070 --> 16:00.790
I spent ...

16:00.830 --> 16:03.110
every day since his death

16:03.630 --> 16:05.440
working it out,

16:06.560 --> 16:08.260
preparing ...

16:08.730 --> 16:11.570
for this moment.

16:13.390 --> 16:16.310
I know he would have understood.

16:17.000 --> 16:19.170
You keep telling yourself that, Helen.

16:19.200 --> 16:21.200
One day you may believe it.

16:25.230 --> 16:26.910
Doesn't matter now.

16:27.920 --> 16:29.470
Soon ...

16:29.510 --> 16:32.270
none of this
will ever have happened.

16:34.370 --> 16:37.240
- What you're gonna do?
- I hope you gonna like this, Connor.

16:37.270 --> 16:39.270
I, Helen Cutter,

16:39.300 --> 16:41.040
I'm gonna save the world.

16:43.430 --> 16:46.070
Since when did you care
so much about the human race?

16:46.110 --> 16:48.620
Well. It's not humanity I'm gonna save.

16:48.650 --> 16:52.100
You know, Helen, you need some serious therapy.

17:11.819 --> 17:13.569
It's a time map.

17:14.140 --> 17:16.780
of every anomaly there has ever been ...

17:18.119 --> 17:19.589
or ever will be.

17:20.839 --> 17:23.890
- Cutter was right.
- There is a path.

17:25.280 --> 17:27.520
With this we will will never have to wait
for anomalies to open again.

17:27.560 --> 17:29.880
We will just know where they are.

17:30.250 --> 17:32.590
Just a sweet clever boy.

17:34.290 --> 17:36.820
Pity shame you have met Cutter.

17:53.630 --> 17:54.730
Gotcha!

18:13.480 --> 18:14.560
You know,

18:15.260 --> 18:16.810
If I were you,

18:16.840 --> 18:19.640
make the most 
of
the time have left.

18:21.850 --> 18:23.080
Believe me,

18:25.760 --> 18:27.390
it won't be long.

18:29.360 --> 18:30.730
Please,

18:30.770 --> 18:31.800
No.

18:32.210 --> 18:33.370
Please,

18:33.400 --> 18:34.430
Helen!

18:49.540 --> 18:50.550
No!

18:57.900 --> 18:59.060
Ok.

18:59.100 --> 19:00.600
- It's time.
- Open it.

19:15.970 --> 19:17.210
Where are they?

19:22.180 --> 19:24.140
Come on, Quinn, hurry up!

19:27.690 --> 19:30.310
She was plug in some kind of ...

19:30.350 --> 19:32.460
We go find out where she was going.

19:32.490 --> 19:34.000
How we can follow her?

19:34.030 --> 19:37.200
But how? This thing is completely dead.

19:37.240 --> 19:42.090
I know, but if we can get it working, then
maybe I can restore the computer's memory.

19:42.440 --> 19:43.540
How?

19:44.430 --> 19:47.010
- We need power.
- Ja.

19:49.370 --> 19:51.680
Batteries ... in the torches.

19:52.270 --> 19:53.360
Great.

19:55.870 --> 19:59.060
- We need to fit them all together.
- Medical kit.

19:59.100 --> 20:00.520
How many we got?

20:05.100 --> 20:06.220
Wires.

20:09.500 --> 20:11.530
Do we need the artifact
to make it work?

20:11.560 --> 20:13.900
No, no, hopefully the ...

20:13.940 --> 20:16.450
the data will be still on the hard drive. So ...

20:16.480 --> 20:18.450
we might not need it.

20:22.450 --> 20:25.880
Site 333. She named the file "site 333".

20:26.210 --> 20:29.510
333, what is that?
A location, a code, what?

20:31.490 --> 20:33.720
- Oh, my God
- What?

20:35.340 --> 20:38.860
The Rift Valley in Africa
For million years ago.

20:38.900 --> 20:42.200
It's the ... the great civilisation site.
*origin of the human race*

20:42.450 --> 20:44.700
333 it's where they
found the remains

20:44.730 --> 20:47.860
of the - so called - first family of ominidis,

20:47.900 --> 20:52.000
A group of 30 early humans
who all died at the same time.

20:52.460 --> 20:53.540
No one survived.

20:53.570 --> 20:56.670
So Helen is gone
to visit the ape man.

20:57.170 --> 20:58.270
No.

20:58.790 --> 21:00.610
She's come to kill the first human, 

21:00.640 --> 21:03.960
want to stop our evolution
in its tracks.

21:03.990 --> 21:06.050
She's gonna wipe us all out.

21:08.110 --> 21:09.490
- Ok?
- Yeah.

21:09.530 --> 21:11.200
... All right I'm on it.

21:15.530 --> 21:16.670
Try lower.

21:17.560 --> 21:19.010
Come on.

21:19.450 --> 21:22.300
I must get this
guy, ????

21:22.640 --> 21:23.690
Ok.

21:25.060 --> 21:27.610
It's not as easy as it looks, you know?

21:42.250 --> 21:44.380
This is gonna give us a small window of time.

21:44.420 --> 21:45.470
All right.

21:46.070 --> 21:47.990
- Are you ready?
- Not really.

21:52.480 --> 21:54.160
Yes. Yes!

22:21.640 --> 22:23.690
Come remember everything!

22:24.400 --> 22:25.900
How she did.

22:27.900 --> 22:29.040
Come on!

22:29.500 --> 22:32.080
Ok, so, 3 3 3.

22:34.590 --> 22:38.340
Ok, this is Helen's route. It looks like
that she's going to two anomalies.

22:38.370 --> 22:40.770
We have to find a way to open them.

22:43.800 --> 22:44.920
Let's do it.

22:45.350 --> 22:46.420
Ok.

22:47.530 --> 22:50.000
- Try to connect.
- All right.

22:52.060 --> 22:54.510
Just be patient Connor. You'll get it!

22:55.070 --> 22:56.360
Concentrate.

22:56.990 --> 22:58.070
Ok.

22:59.980 --> 23:01.130
Guys ...

23:03.500 --> 23:04.830
Predators!

23:05.520 --> 23:07.200
Just hurry up, right?

23:08.030 --> 23:10.020
I'm not very good
under pressure.

23:10.060 --> 23:11.580
Ok, come on.

23:12.220 --> 23:13.740
She ...

23:13.780 --> 23:17.080
put in a series of numbers.
That could be anything ...

23:18.900 --> 23:21.000
It's like some kind of lettering.

23:21.220 --> 23:23.770
No, it's a sequence of numbers.

23:23.920 --> 23:26.970
- Ok, some kind of code?
- Yeah, but to what?

23:30.390 --> 23:31.680
We've got it!

23:32.090 --> 23:34.000
Please let this work.

23:35.590 --> 23:39.740
Five, three, five, nine.

23:40.460 --> 23:41.530
Yes!!

23:42.320 --> 23:43.600
Sorry.

23:44.320 --> 23:45.540
Come on.

23:47.120 --> 23:48.130
Right.

23:48.330 --> 23:50.180
Yeah, come on.

23:51.120 --> 23:54.220
Oh this is taking too long.
We're running out of power.

23:55.710 --> 23:58.600
- Hurry up, Connor.
- I'm as fast as possible. It's downloading.

23:58.640 --> 24:00.580
We have to go, Connor.

24:00.610 --> 24:02.220
Tell me something I don't know.

24:02.250 --> 24:03.830
Ok, 75 percent.

24:07.280 --> 24:08.380
Is coming to an end.

24:09.580 --> 24:10.790
Come on.

24:11.120 --> 24:12.500
80 percent.

24:12.530 --> 24:13.880
They're in here.

24:15.000 --> 24:16.400
95 percent.

24:18.010 --> 24:19.650
100 percent, that's it.

24:19.680 --> 24:20.730
Ok.

24:22.270 --> 24:23.380
Got it.

24:23.930 --> 24:25.260
This is it.

24:25.580 --> 24:26.740
Go!

24:37.960 --> 24:39.630
- Connor!
- Close it!

24:44.130 --> 24:46.130
I didn't die for a second.

24:51.760 --> 24:52.930
Right.

24:54.270 --> 24:55.410
So ...

24:56.400 --> 24:59.040
- Where are we now?
- But more importantly ...

24:59.360 --> 25:00.770
Where's Helen?

25:01.630 --> 25:02.830
Footprints.

25:09.360 --> 25:11.260
- She run this way
- Yeah.

25:14.680 --> 25:17.830
Ok, ancient pines, that could mean this is ...

25:18.080 --> 25:19.670
Jurassic Park ...

25:20.250 --> 25:21.520
maybe ...

25:23.230 --> 25:24.680
maybe the Cretaceous.

25:28.760 --> 25:29.940
So um ...

25:30.030 --> 25:32.830
what sort of creatures
we're talking about?

25:33.720 --> 25:34.940
Well um...

25:35.760 --> 25:36.760
a lot.

25:36.790 --> 25:38.980
Maybe too many to list.

25:40.150 --> 25:43.580
Lot's of theropoda dinosaurs mostly,
kinda carnivores.

25:48.330 --> 25:50.730
Spinosauri, allosaurus ...

25:50.960 --> 25:53.010
apatosauri, barosaurus ...

25:53.110 --> 25:54.170
Oh, good.

25:54.250 --> 25:55.820
And obviously T-Rex.

25:55.860 --> 25:57.460
- ... raptors ...
- Yeah. I've got the point.

25:57.490 --> 25:59.280
No, literally ...

25:59.640 --> 26:01.150
Raptors.

26:14.500 --> 26:16.420
They don't look too bad.

26:30.710 --> 26:31.740
Abby!

26:51.940 --> 26:53.940
Come here! Fast!

26:54.510 --> 26:56.690
- Connor?
- Quickly!

27:14.320 --> 27:16.150
Come here. Ok.

27:29.030 --> 27:32.570
Are these two are raptors. So
at least we know we're in the Cretaceous.

27:32.600 --> 27:34.300
We've got to find the next anomaly.

27:34.340 --> 27:36.090
Before they learn to climb.

27:36.130 --> 27:37.180
No.

27:37.910 --> 27:39.320
- No!
- What?

27:42.500 --> 27:44.820
- This thing is just dying?
- What?

27:44.850 --> 27:45.890
Jap.

27:47.150 --> 27:48.770
We don't know the route.

27:48.810 --> 27:50.910
We can't open the anomalies.

27:51.380 --> 27:53.220
We can't get home.

27:53.570 --> 27:56.520
There might not be a home to get back to.

28:00.490 --> 28:01.550
Bingo.

28:03.090 --> 28:04.170
Over there.

28:04.210 --> 28:05.640
You see?

28:05.680 --> 28:06.720
Yeah.

28:07.570 --> 28:10.270
She get's through another
anomaly. We've lost her.

28:12.930 --> 28:14.110
Any ideas?

28:16.740 --> 28:19.460
We could appeal to their good nature.

28:20.330 --> 28:22.430
- Don't think they've got one.
- Right.

28:22.850 --> 28:24.170
Playtime is over.

28:24.210 --> 28:26.000
Stun grenade. Come on!

28:26.040 --> 28:28.020
- Why I didn't think on that first?
- Raise it!

28:28.050 --> 28:29.080
There.

28:29.930 --> 28:30.930
Got it.

28:35.360 --> 28:36.960
Close your ears.

28:37.440 --> 28:39.370
- And open your mouth.
- Two ...

28:39.410 --> 28:42.110
- One ...
- I must tell you one thing before ...

29:01.160 --> 29:03.190
- Connor?
- Co. .. Connor?

29:03.640 --> 29:04.740
Connor?

29:06.620 --> 29:08.070
Put your foot on it.

29:09.090 --> 29:11.160
Connor! Connor, you're okay?

29:13.120 --> 29:14.180
He's alive.

29:15.250 --> 29:16.380
He's alive!

30:05.910 --> 30:06.930
Go!

30:06.960 --> 30:10.160
- I can't leave here. I won't ...
- You have to stop her!

30:13.040 --> 30:16.040
- We gotta get him somewhere save. Come ...
- Finish it!

30:16.910 --> 30:18.020
Abby ...

30:28.650 --> 30:30.370
Wake up, Connor.

31:25.210 --> 31:26.250
Connor.

31:26.620 --> 31:27.770
Can you hear me?

31:28.800 --> 31:30.470
Just say something!

31:31.800 --> 31:34.200
Come on, don't give up on me now.

31:34.840 --> 31:36.110
Please!

31:36.360 --> 31:38.300
Please! Connor ...

31:38.600 --> 31:39.720
just ...

32:08.570 --> 32:09.810
Come on.

32:10.830 --> 32:12.310
This way.

32:21.080 --> 32:23.960
Hey, take it with someone of your own ... species!

32:23.990 --> 32:25.100
Connor!

32:26.700 --> 32:28.420
I'm gonna save you this time.

32:28.450 --> 32:31.230
It's really sweet from you, Abby. But I think you ...

32:31.500 --> 32:32.750
Cover it.

32:33.720 --> 32:35.400
- How?
- Over there.

32:35.970 --> 32:37.210
I'm sure I'll think out something.

32:37.240 --> 32:39.220
I know that in your current position ...

32:39.250 --> 32:41.760
- you can do anything right now.
- Abby, can you just ...

32:41.790 --> 32:44.390
- What?
- Can we argue about this later?

32:44.700 --> 32:45.700
Yeah?

32:50.650 --> 32:53.180
That was a stupid idea.
I have to admit.

32:53.220 --> 32:54.330
Connor ...

33:02.190 --> 33:03.380
Nice hit.

33:03.650 --> 33:04.970
Thank you.

33:05.460 --> 33:07.090
Let's go ... before ...

33:07.130 --> 33:09.340
the others wake up.

33:09.370 --> 33:11.870
- Ah, yeah. Cool.
- Come on.

33:12.470 --> 33:14.350
- Abby ...
- Come up!

33:14.380 --> 33:16.590
- I will need help.
- Oh, sorry.

33:19.800 --> 33:22.760
- I think I broke my ankle.
- Oh, really?

33:22.790 --> 33:25.300
If it's not a wide break.

33:28.490 --> 33:29.990
Are you okay?

33:41.600 --> 33:44.230
We just need to find somewhere save then ...

33:44.340 --> 33:46.710
then we can find Danny in the morning.

33:46.850 --> 33:47.850
Yeah.

37:06.180 --> 37:09.290
You're too late Danny.
It's already begun.

37:09.610 --> 37:11.090
But thanks.

37:11.340 --> 37:14.670
You know, if I hadn't take me to the ARC,
I never would have got this far.

37:14.710 --> 37:16.360
You killed them.

37:16.910 --> 37:20.200
The humanity is a stain
on the face of the planet.

37:20.240 --> 37:24.780
And when we're gone, other species
would be able to develop in peace.

37:25.060 --> 37:29.150
There will be no wars,
no pollution. No predators.

37:29.430 --> 37:30.510
So ...

37:31.170 --> 37:33.230
You've wiped out humanity.

37:33.260 --> 37:35.270
And how can I still be here?

37:35.300 --> 37:37.880
You're really not big bright. Are you, Danny?

37:41.700 --> 37:43.590
You know, I haven't finished yet.

37:44.690 --> 37:46.640
There's more to kill.

37:47.060 --> 37:51.160
But you'll be surprised at how
a few ominidi started the human race.

37:51.680 --> 37:54.740
- It won't take long.
- You gonna kill yourself as well.

37:56.970 --> 37:58.220
I don't care.

38:07.410 --> 38:10.980
Whatever you do, humanity
will find a way to evolve.

38:11.010 --> 38:14.310
- You can't fight nature.
- You sound just like Nick.

38:14.910 --> 38:16.160
And you know what?

38:17.320 --> 38:18.770
You're both wrong.

38:20.970 --> 38:22.130
Goodbye, Danny.

38:55.590 --> 38:56.990
Good boy.

39:18.070 --> 39:20.290
I think we'll be safe here, Connor.

39:20.330 --> 39:23.150
And then, like I said, we can ...

39:23.400 --> 39:25.370
find Danny in the morning.

39:31.460 --> 39:32.840
What hurts?

39:35.300 --> 39:36.870
Pretty much everything.

39:42.130 --> 39:43.850
Close your eyes.

39:44.280 --> 39:45.490
What?

39:45.960 --> 39:48.150
Close your eyes.

39:51.770 --> 39:54.120
Imagine a happy place.

39:56.620 --> 39:59.320
You're on a beautiful beach.

40:01.000 --> 40:02.990
And the sun is shining.

40:03.300 --> 40:04.630
Are you there too?

40:05.360 --> 40:06.360
Yeah.

40:07.350 --> 40:08.600
If you like.

40:09.740 --> 40:11.050
Are you wearing a bikini?

40:14.480 --> 40:15.490
Yes!

40:17.260 --> 40:18.640
... if you like.

40:19.040 --> 40:20.840
The water is really warm.

40:23.250 --> 40:24.510
It's lovely.

40:24.550 --> 40:25.560
Yeah.

40:29.800 --> 40:30.500
Abby?

40:30.860 --> 40:31.880
Mh.

40:34.420 --> 40:36.320
Can I move back into the flat please?

40:41.650 --> 40:42.670
Yeah.

40:54.860 --> 40:56.120
Sweet dreams.

40:56.750 --> 40:57.850
See you in the morning.

41:06.920 --> 41:08.040
Hopefully.

41:20.730 --> 41:22.280
What we're gonna do?

41:24.040 --> 41:25.340
They're will be back.

41:31.690 --> 41:32.970
I've got an idea.

42:18.410 --> 42:19.520
Right.

42:20.770 --> 42:22.560
Which way home?
