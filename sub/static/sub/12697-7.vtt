WEBVTT

00:07.050 --> 00:08.530
Seriously, Harper?

00:08.573 --> 00:10.923
Our apartment looks like
Forever 21 on Black Friday.

00:10.967 --> 00:12.708
I'm working on my lookbook.

00:12.751 --> 00:14.710
I snagged an interview
for a styling job

00:14.753 --> 00:16.929
with the fifth runner-up
from RuPaul's Drag Race.

00:16.973 --> 00:19.932
Oh, then you actually
need more boas.

00:19.976 --> 00:21.325
I'm really excited for you,
but it feels like

00:21.369 --> 00:22.892
a new lookbook every day.

00:22.935 --> 00:24.328
How much longer
is this gonna take?

00:24.372 --> 00:25.764
How much longer is it gonna take

00:25.808 --> 00:27.331
for me to make
my dreams come true

00:27.375 --> 00:28.985
so I can leave my dead-end job?

00:29.029 --> 00:31.596
I don't know,
but I'll keep youposted.

00:33.990 --> 00:37.080
Well, can we at least
move these boots

00:37.124 --> 00:41.084
into my closet,
'cause I am obsessed with them.

00:41.128 --> 00:43.173
Look, I'm sorry,
but it's hard when I don't have

00:43.217 --> 00:46.916
my own dedicated workspace
to destroy.

00:46.959 --> 00:50.485
Ladies, may I present
the latest Sunshine Girl,

00:50.528 --> 00:52.356
Millicent Mitchell.

00:52.400 --> 00:54.619
-[BOTH]: Aw.
-[CARLY]: Oh, my God.

00:54.663 --> 00:57.013
-She's so cute.
-So adorable.

00:57.057 --> 01:00.408
I don't need compliments.
I need a way out of this.

01:00.451 --> 01:02.105
Look, it's gonna be great.

01:02.149 --> 01:04.586
You'll get to do activities
with kids your own age,

01:04.629 --> 01:07.328
earn badges, and, the best part?

01:07.371 --> 01:09.243
You and I will get to spend
a lot more time together.

01:09.286 --> 01:11.593
If you want to hang out more,
just ask,

01:11.636 --> 01:14.596
so I can try to pencil you in.

01:14.639 --> 01:19.296
[exhales]
Is it just me, or is life grand?

01:19.340 --> 01:21.124
Somebody's wearing the clothes
he had on yesterday.

01:21.168 --> 01:22.821
Are you doing the walk of sh...

01:22.865 --> 01:24.214
Shame we can't stay.

01:24.258 --> 01:26.869
[MILLICENT]:
Stop impeding my education.

01:27.870 --> 01:29.393
So what happened to you?
You meet a lady?

01:29.437 --> 01:31.439
Way more probable, he thought
that shirt and tie combo

01:31.482 --> 01:32.875
was cute enough to repeat.

01:32.918 --> 01:34.094
[whispers]:
It isn't.

01:34.137 --> 01:36.357
I did meet a lady.

01:36.400 --> 01:39.142
I was at the art gallery
gushing over my own sculpture

01:39.186 --> 01:41.492
and there she was: Argenthina.

01:41.536 --> 01:45.017
She's fan-thastic.
And she gave me this tie.

01:45.061 --> 01:46.845
I try to avoid
complimenting men,

01:46.889 --> 01:48.412
but leopard
is my favorite neutral.

01:48.456 --> 01:50.022
Homegirl got taste.

01:50.066 --> 01:51.372
[CARLY]:
Hey, Spencer,

01:51.415 --> 01:52.895
how do you feel about Harper

01:52.938 --> 01:54.592
sharing your studio with me
so she can put

01:54.636 --> 01:57.160
all of her looks in a book
instead of our living room?

01:57.204 --> 01:59.641
-Mm... -It's Black History
Month, so you have to say yes.

01:59.684 --> 02:01.556
Mm-hmm.

02:01.599 --> 02:02.992

02:03.035 --> 02:04.515

This is great.

02:36.068 --> 02:38.158
Two modern women,
working side by side,

02:38.201 --> 02:40.682
creating art that will
change the world.

02:40.725 --> 02:42.640
I'm editing a video where
I see how many marshmallows

02:42.684 --> 02:44.294
I can fit in my mouth.

02:44.338 --> 02:47.036
Spoiler, it's more
than you think.

02:48.255 --> 02:49.343
I'm gonna put my headphones on.

02:49.386 --> 02:50.953
Let me know
if you need anything.

02:55.392 --> 02:57.177
One mallow!

02:58.482 --> 03:00.005
Two mallow!

03:01.398 --> 03:03.139
Three mallow!
[laughs]

03:04.619 --> 03:08.275
Oh, my God, this is even funnier
than when I filmed it!

03:08.318 --> 03:10.059
Is it?

03:17.936 --> 03:20.374
Uh... Harper?

03:20.417 --> 03:22.332
I love a spa trip
as much as the next girl,

03:22.376 --> 03:24.682
but the steam's
kind of killing me.

03:24.726 --> 03:28.033
Oh, am I harshing
your "mallow"?!

03:28.077 --> 03:29.905
I see what you did there,
but joke's on you,

03:29.948 --> 03:31.559
'cause I'm totally
gonna use that.

03:34.214 --> 03:36.041
-And now a toast.
-Ah.

03:36.085 --> 03:40.481
To chance encounters
and exploiting opportunities.

03:40.524 --> 03:42.265
My darling Argenthina.

03:42.309 --> 03:44.311
To getting lost in your eyes,

03:44.354 --> 03:47.575
and then somehow finding my way
out through your ears.

03:47.618 --> 03:50.012
-Or possibly your nostrils.
-Please stop.

03:51.056 --> 03:52.667
Ooh, that reminds me.

03:53.581 --> 03:56.366
I brought you a little gift.

03:56.410 --> 03:57.933
Is that a pterodactyl egg?

03:57.976 --> 03:59.935
You're the one
who outbid me on eBay?

03:59.978 --> 04:02.024
[chuckles]
No, it's a digital assistant.

04:02.067 --> 04:03.852
Introduce yourself.

04:03.895 --> 04:06.681
Good evening,
I'm Mr. Spencer Shay.

04:06.724 --> 04:08.160
[DEVICE] [Argentina's voice]:
You need a mint.

04:08.204 --> 04:10.293
Now ordering breath mints.

04:10.337 --> 04:12.991
-Wait, that's your voice!
-I do the voice.

04:14.602 --> 04:17.431
You know, this apartment
just looks so familiar.

04:17.474 --> 04:19.084
Wait.

04:19.128 --> 04:21.957
Never mind, I know.
I've seen it on iCarly.

04:22.000 --> 04:23.175
You watch iCarly?

04:23.219 --> 04:25.265
-I watch everything.
-Oh.

04:25.308 --> 04:27.354
You know, Maybe if Carly's
lucky, we'll meet someday.

04:27.397 --> 04:29.921
[HARPER]: Take your marshmallows
and stuff them.

04:29.965 --> 04:32.272
-That's what I was doing.
-Ooh, sick comeback.

04:32.315 --> 04:34.099
I'll come up with a better one
in the shower.

04:34.143 --> 04:35.492
-You better not. I need to pee
when you're in there! -Ladies,

04:35.536 --> 04:36.885
ladies.

04:36.928 --> 04:38.408
What is going on?

04:38.452 --> 04:40.976
[BOTH]: She started it.
What? No, you started it.

04:41.019 --> 04:43.326
Okay. Finger-pointing
and speaking in unison

04:43.370 --> 04:44.762
won't solve anything.

04:44.806 --> 04:46.286
Who's she?

04:46.329 --> 04:48.766
Yeah. Who is she?

04:48.810 --> 04:50.551
She's the woman
I'm trying to be on a date with.

04:50.594 --> 04:52.814
-This is...
-Argenthina Woolridge.

04:52.857 --> 04:55.338
Harvard and MIT graduate,
Forbeslist of women

04:55.382 --> 04:59.560
with unlisted ages
and founder of LeapIN.

04:59.603 --> 05:00.996
Ooh, the trampoline place?

05:01.039 --> 05:02.563
I thought you needed
a kid to go there.

05:02.606 --> 05:05.217
No, it's a ladies-only
coworking space

05:05.261 --> 05:08.395
meant to propel women
into corporate powerhouses.

05:08.438 --> 05:10.266
And we have a juice bar.

05:10.310 --> 05:12.399
-Wow, we could really use that.
-Mm-hmm.

05:12.442 --> 05:14.357
I love juice and if we work
together for one more minute,

05:14.401 --> 05:16.359
-I'm gonna kill her.
-Girl, I have a black belt.

05:16.403 --> 05:18.927
-Yeah, from Prada.
-Ooh, drag me.

05:18.970 --> 05:21.886
Well, we're having a prospective
members salon this weekend.

05:21.930 --> 05:23.148
You should come by
and check it out.

05:23.192 --> 05:25.325
Okay, they'll be there.

05:25.368 --> 05:27.196
Now can you please
be anywhere else?

05:27.239 --> 05:30.373
-So great meeting you.
-Yeah. See you at the salon.

05:34.334 --> 05:36.336
Okay. Now, where were we?

05:36.379 --> 05:38.947
[DEVICE]:
Recommence flirting.

05:38.990 --> 05:40.905
-Isn't she great?
-Yeah.

05:44.431 --> 05:46.041
Who wants lemonade?

05:46.084 --> 05:48.565
You girls must be tired
from all that vision-boarding.

05:48.609 --> 05:51.307
Mr. Benson, we don't use
the word "girls."

05:51.351 --> 05:52.569
But you're called
the Sunshine Girls.

05:52.613 --> 05:54.963
Not if we win
our class-action lawsuit.

05:55.006 --> 05:59.228
Okay, let's see how you guys
have mapped out your dreams.

05:59.271 --> 06:01.361
Olive, we'll start with you.

06:01.404 --> 06:03.101
Miss Kiki, I made a rainbow.

06:03.145 --> 06:05.626
It represents
community and unity.

06:05.669 --> 06:06.975
Ugh, how derivative.

06:07.018 --> 06:09.194
Great job, Olive.

06:09.238 --> 06:12.502
I think that deserves
some sunbeam fingers.

06:12.546 --> 06:14.112
[all shrieking]

06:14.156 --> 06:17.464
So, Millicent,
what's on your board?

06:17.507 --> 06:20.292
A penthouse condo,
a pyramid made of gold bricks

06:20.336 --> 06:22.686
and a life insurance policy.

06:22.730 --> 06:26.342
You know, in case something
"happens" to my future spouse.

06:27.691 --> 06:29.867
I also drew a heart.

06:29.911 --> 06:31.478
-[all shrieking]
-[laughs]

06:32.740 --> 06:34.437
Hey, I think
the pyramid's awesome.

06:34.481 --> 06:35.830
[KIKI]:
You know what I heart?

06:35.873 --> 06:38.485
Our annual fudge ball sale.

06:38.528 --> 06:40.617
-What's that?
-It's our biggest fundraiser.

06:40.661 --> 06:42.097
Ooh, I do like funds.

06:42.140 --> 06:43.403
Ooh, well,
the money goes to corporate.

06:43.446 --> 06:46.318
But you get something
even better.

06:46.362 --> 06:47.755
A badge.

06:47.798 --> 06:51.323
[chuckles] Look, Kiki,
that's not gonna cut it.

06:51.367 --> 06:53.674
If I do the work,
I should get paid.

06:53.717 --> 06:55.284
That's my girl.

06:55.327 --> 06:58.461
I mean, young person.

06:58.505 --> 07:00.463
Well, maybe one day
you can start your own club

07:00.507 --> 07:02.857
and make whatever rules
you want.

07:02.900 --> 07:05.990
That's the smartest thing
you've ever said, Kiki.

07:06.034 --> 07:08.340
I'll sell my own fudge balls.

07:08.384 --> 07:10.865
Then you will be hearing
from our lawyers.

07:10.908 --> 07:13.258
Then we will be selling
something else.

07:16.871 --> 07:21.353
A leap is a group of leopards,
hence the decor.

07:21.397 --> 07:24.269
As you can see,
it's an ideal workspace

07:24.313 --> 07:27.055
where you can dip in
for an hour between meetings.

07:27.098 --> 07:30.450
Not to mention the member closet
you can borrow clothes from.

07:30.493 --> 07:33.191
It's purr-fect for a lookbook.
[laughs]

07:33.235 --> 07:35.455
What is in this green juice?

07:35.498 --> 07:37.021
You thought of everything.

07:37.065 --> 07:38.936
Podcast studio,
conference rooms,

07:38.980 --> 07:40.590
meditation labyrinth.

07:40.634 --> 07:44.507
Embroidery class, puppy rental
for dating profile pics,

07:44.551 --> 07:46.335
bra concierge.

07:47.292 --> 07:48.642
What are those?

07:48.685 --> 07:51.340
Oh, that is a Femi-nest.

07:51.383 --> 07:53.342
Trademarked, patent pending.

07:53.385 --> 07:56.606
So often women are told we can't
express our aspirations.

07:56.650 --> 07:59.348
In the nest,
you scream them out.

07:59.391 --> 08:00.784
It's incredibly transgressive.

08:00.828 --> 08:03.918
But they're also soundproof,
so it's not rude.

08:03.961 --> 08:06.050
Go ahead, give it a spin.

08:06.094 --> 08:09.401
Oh, I'd love to, but one time
I was getting an MRI,

08:09.445 --> 08:12.796
and the technician
forgot about me, so I'm good.

08:12.840 --> 08:15.364
Harper hates small spaces, too,
so she's not gonna want to...

08:15.407 --> 08:17.714
Ooh! This is just like
Brookstone.

08:17.758 --> 08:19.368
See you!

08:19.411 --> 08:21.413
I'll go grab
some membership forms.

08:22.545 --> 08:23.807
Carly?

08:23.851 --> 08:25.417
Toji?

08:25.461 --> 08:27.594
I haven't seen you
in months at yoga.

08:27.637 --> 08:28.812
Yeah, I've been
taking class here.

08:28.856 --> 08:29.987
Are you thinking about joining?

08:30.031 --> 08:31.511
Uh, maybe. It seems kind of fun.

08:31.554 --> 08:34.514
Oh, it is. I live for LeapIN.

08:36.603 --> 08:38.561
-Don't do it.
-Don't do what?

08:38.605 --> 08:42.260
Don't leap in.

08:42.304 --> 08:43.566
[HARPER]:
Wow.

08:43.610 --> 08:45.263
I feel a sense of calm
and moral clarity

08:45.307 --> 08:47.309
I've never experienced before.

08:47.352 --> 08:48.832
I'm leaping all the way in.

08:53.968 --> 08:55.404
Toji, tell Harper
what you just said.

08:55.447 --> 08:56.840
-Before you sign up, you...
-Here we go.

08:56.884 --> 08:58.581
Dip in for an hour
between meetings.

08:58.625 --> 09:00.931
Toji, aren't you late for yoga?

09:00.975 --> 09:03.717
-Thank you for the feedback.
-[laughs softly]

09:04.979 --> 09:06.937
Harper, what do you think?

09:06.981 --> 09:10.114
I'm thinking, do you take Amex?

09:10.158 --> 09:11.551
Exclusively.

09:11.594 --> 09:14.118
Here is a membership form
and you can keep the pen.

09:14.162 --> 09:16.904
-Thank you.
-Carly, how about you?

09:16.947 --> 09:20.385
No, that's cool.
I'm good for pens.

09:20.429 --> 09:23.780
If you don't join,
you'll never see Harper again.

09:23.824 --> 09:26.130
'Cause she'll be
so busy here at LeapIN.

09:27.654 --> 09:29.743
Yeah, but I don't need
a workspace.

09:29.786 --> 09:31.005
I can just use the studio
where I shoot.

09:31.048 --> 09:33.050
iCarly?
Three million subscribers,

09:33.094 --> 09:37.446
60% women in the coveted
18-to-49 demographic?

09:37.489 --> 09:38.621
How did you know that?

09:38.665 --> 09:40.014
I know my metrics.

09:40.057 --> 09:42.277
I'd love to be on your show.

09:42.320 --> 09:45.541
I could do Thursday at 2:00,
or you could come here,

09:45.585 --> 09:46.542
which would be better for me.

09:46.586 --> 09:48.109
[chuckles]
Yeah.

09:48.152 --> 09:51.591
I'll definitely be
voluntarily coming back here.

09:51.634 --> 09:53.810
[chuckles]

09:56.291 --> 09:59.207
Great job, Olive.
A hundred more like that

09:59.250 --> 10:01.688
and you'll earn yourself
a three-minute bathroom break.

10:01.731 --> 10:04.212
Don't need one.
I'm wearing a diaper.

10:04.255 --> 10:06.606
Love the work ethic.

10:07.694 --> 10:09.870
Wow. Looks great in here.

10:09.913 --> 10:11.915
Everybody's on task,
I got a clipboard.

10:11.959 --> 10:14.439
And I filed for an LLC.

10:14.483 --> 10:17.660
What? Millicent's Minions?

10:17.704 --> 10:20.358
Love. Take that, Miss Kiki.

10:20.402 --> 10:23.840
Oh, we are gonna out-cute,
outsmart and outsell

10:23.884 --> 10:26.147
those sunny little
goodie-goodies.

10:26.190 --> 10:27.496
No offense, Olive.

10:27.539 --> 10:30.760
None taken.
Already burned my uniform.

10:30.804 --> 10:32.719
Hey, that reminds me.
I went ahead

10:32.762 --> 10:34.590
and optimized our website
for mobile,

10:34.634 --> 10:35.939
but what's our growth strategy?

10:35.983 --> 10:37.419
You know? Let's talk marketing.

10:37.462 --> 10:39.421
Do we have a logo?

10:39.464 --> 10:42.903
Looks like Millicent's Minions
has found its secret ingredient.

10:42.946 --> 10:43.686
Revenge?

10:43.730 --> 10:45.340
Yes. And you.

10:45.383 --> 10:49.649
Congrats, you're my new CDO:
chief dad officer.

10:50.650 --> 10:52.042
Did you just called me "Dad"?

10:52.086 --> 10:54.784
Calm down, there were
two other words in there.

10:57.700 --> 11:00.660
I told the Femi-nest I wanted
to build my styling website

11:00.703 --> 11:04.272
and then I got an ad for a class
on how to build a website.

11:04.315 --> 11:07.014
Now, tell me I didn't
womanifest that.

11:07.057 --> 11:09.320
You didn't womanifest that.

11:09.364 --> 11:11.583
There's just something off
about LeapIN.

11:11.627 --> 11:14.935
Oh, 'cause Toji cried? She cried
when a Popsicle was over.

11:14.978 --> 11:18.460
Yeah. Maybe you're right
and I'm just overreacting.

11:18.503 --> 11:20.027
Of course I'm right.

11:20.070 --> 11:21.506
And look on the bright side.

11:21.550 --> 11:23.117
Now I can work on my lookbook
at LeapIN,

11:23.160 --> 11:25.685
and our apartment
will finally be clean.

11:28.426 --> 11:29.950
Or not.

11:29.993 --> 11:31.952
Sorry, we needed
more counter space.

11:31.995 --> 11:33.605
And these are gluten-free
with leopard spots?

11:33.649 --> 11:35.564
What do you think, I started
this business yesterday?

11:35.607 --> 11:37.479
You did start yesterday.

11:37.522 --> 11:39.829
Cupcakes for my lady.
She's celiac.

11:42.266 --> 11:44.051
This is all
for the Sunshine Girls?

11:44.094 --> 11:47.445
Nope.
♪ Millicent's Minions.

11:47.489 --> 11:50.361
We started our own business
to outsell the Sunshine Girls.

11:50.405 --> 11:53.234
We're bonding.
She even called me the D-word.

11:53.277 --> 11:54.365
Dumbass?

11:54.409 --> 11:55.758
No. Dad.

11:55.802 --> 11:57.760
We're really connecting.

11:58.630 --> 11:59.980
Great news.

12:00.023 --> 12:02.504
I just came up
with a new cupcake flavor.

12:02.547 --> 12:04.245
Peanut butter crunch.

12:04.288 --> 12:05.637
Ooh, do you have any idea
how many people

12:05.681 --> 12:06.987
have a peanut allergy?

12:07.030 --> 12:09.293
You might as well
call them murder-cakes.

12:09.337 --> 12:11.339
-Well, I also came up
with a new logo. -Oh.

12:12.688 --> 12:15.386
Uh, it looks like it was
designed by an 11-year-old.

12:15.430 --> 12:16.692
It was.

12:16.736 --> 12:18.085
Aw.

12:18.128 --> 12:20.478
Oh, I am putting this
on the fridge.

12:20.522 --> 12:21.741
But not the box.

12:26.354 --> 12:29.661
Carly, I'm so glad you decided
to give LeapIN another chance.

12:29.705 --> 12:33.187
Me, too. Honestly, I feel kind
of silly for being so paranoid.

12:33.230 --> 12:36.190
-This flower-arranging class
is fun. -Mm.

12:36.233 --> 12:39.193
And finally,
a pop of red at the center

12:39.236 --> 12:42.631
for the heart chakra
and blood oaths.

12:42.674 --> 12:45.460
Fun, and now alarming.

12:45.503 --> 12:47.679
I'll come around and check
on everyone's progress.

12:47.723 --> 12:50.813
Oh, my God. Carly Shay

12:50.857 --> 12:53.076
-from iCarly?-Are you thinking
of joining LeapIN?

12:53.120 --> 12:54.686
It would be so perfect for you.

12:54.730 --> 12:56.123
-Because you could just dip in.
-For an hour.

12:56.166 --> 12:58.342
[BOTH]:
Between meetings.

12:58.386 --> 13:00.040
I keep hearing that.

13:00.083 --> 13:01.781
Harper loves it here.

13:01.824 --> 13:04.740
Last night's 3:00 a.m. hot yoga
session changed her life.

13:04.784 --> 13:05.959
-Mm-hmm.
-Wait, what?

13:06.002 --> 13:07.656
Uh, you were here
until 3:00 a.m.

13:07.699 --> 13:09.136
working on your lookbook?

13:09.179 --> 13:12.835
Uh, yeah. Like Argenthina
always says, work hard...

13:12.879 --> 13:14.794
[ALL]:
Work harder.

13:14.837 --> 13:17.405
Oh, beautiful work, Harper.

13:17.448 --> 13:20.843
Oh, here, let me show you
how to tie off your bouquet.

13:20.887 --> 13:23.106
You see, flowers are like women.

13:23.150 --> 13:25.892
Individually they're pretty,
but useless.

13:25.935 --> 13:28.677
As a group, they're vibrant.

13:28.720 --> 13:31.680
Thriving. Beautiful.

13:31.723 --> 13:33.116
Are you okay?

13:33.160 --> 13:36.554
Hands don't actually
need circulation.

13:36.598 --> 13:37.947
Yum. Juice.

13:39.557 --> 13:42.212
So, Carly,
have you reconsidered joining?

13:42.256 --> 13:44.824
Uh, you've given me
a lot to process.

13:44.867 --> 13:47.087
In fact,
I need to talk to Harper.

13:47.130 --> 13:49.002
Oh, well, the nests
offer excellent privacy.

13:49.045 --> 13:51.047
There's also
that super secret room.

13:51.091 --> 13:53.658
My office?
No one is allowed in there.

13:53.702 --> 13:55.182
We'll be over here.

13:58.402 --> 14:00.665
Secret rooms?
Middle-of-the-night athletics?

14:00.709 --> 14:03.973
Those freaky pod things?
This place is a cult.

14:04.017 --> 14:06.454
Yeah, but not like
a "cult" cult.

14:06.497 --> 14:08.935
It's a fun one,
like a fancy stationary bike

14:08.978 --> 14:10.632
or an overpriced improv class.

14:10.675 --> 14:12.852
-Plus, you can...
-If you say "dip in for an hour

14:12.895 --> 14:13.983
between meetings,"
I will slap you.

14:14.027 --> 14:15.506
Argenthina was right.

14:15.550 --> 14:17.247
Your negativity
is holding me back,

14:17.291 --> 14:18.770
and I will not stand for it
any longer.

14:18.814 --> 14:20.250
Now if you will excuse me,

14:20.294 --> 14:21.861
I'm gonna go stock up
on DivaCups.

14:21.904 --> 14:23.514
They're unlimited here.

14:23.558 --> 14:26.866
The whole point of a DivaCup
is you only need one.

14:29.956 --> 14:31.174
-[whirring]
-[door opens]

14:31.218 --> 14:34.047
We need to talk. Now.

14:34.090 --> 14:36.353
-Cool box.
-Hey, thanks.

14:36.397 --> 14:38.703
I'm just packing up a sculpture
for LeapIN.

14:38.747 --> 14:42.185
Damn it, Argentina
is manipulating everyone.

14:42.229 --> 14:44.274
Manipulating? More like helping.

14:44.318 --> 14:47.408
The other day my accountant says
I needs tax write-offs.

14:47.451 --> 14:50.237
The next thing I knew,
Argenthina says I can donate

14:50.280 --> 14:53.501
one of my sculptures to LeapIN,
as a tax write-off.

14:53.544 --> 14:55.155
And you don't think
that's a little convenient?

14:55.198 --> 14:57.505
It's like she's always
one step ahead.

14:57.548 --> 14:59.289
Calm down, Nancy Drew.

14:59.333 --> 15:02.292
I'll have you know
Nancy Drew had successful books,

15:02.336 --> 15:04.207
a number of television spin-offs

15:04.251 --> 15:06.514
and could easily do the work
of two Hardy Boys.

15:06.557 --> 15:09.778
So, thank you
for the compliment.

15:09.821 --> 15:12.172
There's something up
with Argentina and those nests,

15:12.215 --> 15:14.000
and I'm gonna get
to the bottom of it.

15:28.536 --> 15:29.929
[beeps]

15:29.972 --> 15:31.321
Carly?

15:32.583 --> 15:34.846
Yep. It's me.
[chuckles]

15:34.890 --> 15:37.153
I'm just stretching.

15:37.197 --> 15:40.243
You are literally
the healthiest person I know.

15:40.287 --> 15:42.028
[CELESTE]:
And you're back.

15:42.071 --> 15:43.377
Does that mean
you're joining LeapIN?

15:43.420 --> 15:45.553
Uh, thinking about it.
It'd be so nice

15:45.596 --> 15:48.686
to just dip in for an hour
between meetings.

15:48.730 --> 15:49.949
[BOTH]:
Exactly.

15:51.820 --> 15:55.215
Quick question, do you guys
have a lost and found?

15:55.258 --> 15:56.738
Yeah, it's all the way
in the back.

15:56.781 --> 15:59.349
Oh, the other day,
I left my sweater here.

15:59.393 --> 16:01.699
Oh. I'll go look.
What color was it?

16:01.743 --> 16:04.833
It's denim, but also camouflage,

16:04.876 --> 16:07.923
with fringe and neon.

16:07.967 --> 16:10.926
Sounds cute. Give me a minute.

16:10.970 --> 16:12.449
Take all the minutes you need.

16:12.493 --> 16:14.321
And maybe you should help her.

16:14.364 --> 16:16.410
'Cause I'm a Gemini,
so it's probably better

16:16.453 --> 16:17.846
if two people go.

16:17.889 --> 16:19.979
That makes so much sense.

16:20.022 --> 16:21.241
[laughs softly]

16:26.550 --> 16:27.377
[beeps]

16:33.993 --> 16:36.038
-You're spying on people.
-Carly.

16:36.082 --> 16:37.039
I'm just eavesdropping.

16:37.083 --> 16:39.085
But that's illegal.

16:39.128 --> 16:41.130
Not according
to our terms of service.

16:41.174 --> 16:42.871
Nobody reads those things.

16:42.914 --> 16:45.395
What's the problem?
Your phone is listening to you.

16:45.439 --> 16:47.441
Social media's listening to you.

16:47.484 --> 16:50.270
Well, yeah, that's 'cause
it's trying to sell you some...

16:50.313 --> 16:53.186
Oh, God,
the nests are mining our data

16:53.229 --> 16:55.057
so you can sell us stuff.

16:55.101 --> 16:57.712
Not me.
Corporations who are willing

16:57.755 --> 16:59.322
to pay me for your data.

16:59.366 --> 17:01.933
It's actually a much better
business model

17:01.977 --> 17:04.197
than selling an actual product.

17:04.240 --> 17:06.329
I won't let you
get away with this.

17:06.373 --> 17:07.809
[laughs]

17:07.852 --> 17:10.072
Listen, you little bitch.

17:10.116 --> 17:11.682
I am done asking nicely.

17:11.726 --> 17:14.511
Put me on iCarly
so I can promote LeapIN.

17:14.555 --> 17:17.645
Or what? You won't let me dip in
for an hour between meetings?

17:17.688 --> 17:18.602
Or...

17:20.300 --> 17:22.302
...your friend's little lookbook

17:22.345 --> 17:24.434
might disappear
off this flash drive.

17:25.957 --> 17:27.959
Fine. But you're driving.

17:28.003 --> 17:29.918
Fun. We can put the top down.

17:36.229 --> 17:38.405
Hey, hey, great news.

17:38.448 --> 17:41.060
The Pear Store approved our app.

17:41.103 --> 17:43.758
Wait, what's going on?
Why isn't anybody working?

17:43.801 --> 17:45.499
We're in the middle
of a board meeting.

17:45.542 --> 17:48.197
Motion to remove Mr. Benson
as acting CDO.

17:48.241 --> 17:51.200
-I second that motion.
-Great.

17:51.244 --> 17:52.723
You're firing me?

17:52.767 --> 17:54.812
We haven't officially voted yet,
and Olive

17:54.856 --> 17:58.120
still has to finalize
your exit package, but yes.

17:58.164 --> 18:02.168
[scoffs] Um, do you girls
mind giving us a moment?

18:02.211 --> 18:03.952
You cool, Millicent?

18:03.995 --> 18:05.823
I'm cool.

18:11.699 --> 18:14.528
[scoffs]
What is this all about?

18:14.571 --> 18:17.139
Millicent's Minions was supposed
to be about cupcakes

18:17.183 --> 18:19.098
and taking down
the Sunshine Girls.

18:19.141 --> 18:20.795
Yeah, and that's what
we're doing.

18:20.838 --> 18:23.232
No. That's what you're doing.

18:23.276 --> 18:24.799
You were supposed to help,

18:24.842 --> 18:27.062
but instead you took over
and got carried away,

18:27.106 --> 18:30.326
and now Olive doesn't have
any feeling in her left hand.

18:30.370 --> 18:35.157
Oh, man, I'm gonna get another
mean voice mail from her mom.

18:36.332 --> 18:40.162
[sighs]
Look, Millicent, I'm sorry.

18:40.206 --> 18:41.859
I just wanted
to spend time with you,

18:41.903 --> 18:43.992
but I didn't even
get to do that.

18:44.035 --> 18:46.125
Look, you may not
be CDO anymore,

18:46.168 --> 18:49.171
but I guess I'll keep you on
as my dad.

18:51.173 --> 18:52.740
Dad?

18:52.783 --> 18:54.437
Don't make it weird.

18:54.481 --> 18:57.701
[chuckles, sniffles]
Sorry. Okay. Um...

18:57.745 --> 19:00.269
Good luck with your cupcakes.

19:00.313 --> 19:01.792
Oh, no, we're done.

19:01.836 --> 19:03.751
That was gonna be
the next item on the agenda.

19:03.794 --> 19:05.927
It's time to pivot
to real estate.

19:05.970 --> 19:07.668
It's all about passive income.

19:07.711 --> 19:10.236
How much money
do we have in the bank?

19:14.631 --> 19:15.893
Spencer?

19:15.937 --> 19:17.330
Hey, Harper.
Enjoying flourishing

19:17.373 --> 19:19.158
in your all-women environment?

19:19.201 --> 19:21.377
I was. What are you doing here?

19:21.421 --> 19:23.814
Oh, they gave me a man-pass
so I could set up my sculpture.

19:23.858 --> 19:25.773
I just have to stay
six feet away from members

19:25.816 --> 19:27.427
and not make a scene.

19:27.470 --> 19:29.080
-Ooh, cucumber water.

19:42.833 --> 19:44.139
Did I make a scene?

19:44.183 --> 19:46.924
Nah, I'm sure no one noticed.

19:46.968 --> 19:48.665
[gasps]

19:48.709 --> 19:50.058
The secret room.

19:51.015 --> 19:53.366
[laughs]:
Ooh.

19:53.409 --> 19:56.369
What a fun
airport security vibe.

19:56.412 --> 19:58.109
[HARPER]:
There's Toji.

19:58.153 --> 20:01.156
Why is there a live feed
inside the nests?

20:01.200 --> 20:04.028
For safety stuff.
Nothing nefarious.

20:04.072 --> 20:06.509
Why is there a live feed
of your living room?

20:06.553 --> 20:08.424
Okay, that's a little nefarious.

20:08.468 --> 20:10.861
What's your boyfriend/my brother
gonna say about this?

20:10.905 --> 20:12.689
I don't care.

20:12.733 --> 20:16.998
I was just using Spencer to get
to you and your subscribers.

20:17.041 --> 20:18.217
[HARPER]:
Oh, my God.

20:18.260 --> 20:19.609
Carly was right.

20:19.653 --> 20:21.655
All that free eye cream
brightened my eyes

20:21.698 --> 20:23.787
but blinded me to the truth.

20:23.831 --> 20:26.225
We got to get to the studio
and help her.

20:26.268 --> 20:28.488
Oh, after we grab
two green juices for energy.

20:28.531 --> 20:31.665
Three. One for Argenthina--
Damn it, I still love her!

20:35.059 --> 20:36.887
Come on. What is taking so long?

20:36.931 --> 20:38.846
[sighs]
T-The camera's being weird.

20:38.889 --> 20:40.804
I don't know how to fix it.

20:40.848 --> 20:42.980
My producer Freddie
usually does this.

20:43.024 --> 20:44.808
Oh, God, Carly,
that's embarrassing, all right?

20:44.852 --> 20:47.637
You really need a man
to just turn on a camera?

20:47.681 --> 20:50.379
Carly, we're here to save you.

20:50.423 --> 20:52.729
And I didn't get you
a green juice.

20:52.773 --> 20:54.209
But you can have mine.

20:54.253 --> 20:55.602
CARLY:
No-- Don't give her anything.

20:55.645 --> 20:57.168
She's evil.

20:57.212 --> 20:59.606
Yeah. An evil genius.

21:00.868 --> 21:02.826
Hardly. She's using the nests

21:02.870 --> 21:04.828
to mine data
just like every phone does.

21:04.872 --> 21:09.268
Her plan is kind of basic.
No offense.

21:09.311 --> 21:12.053
[laughs]:
Basic? Basic?

21:12.096 --> 21:16.492
Okay. Your phone might pick up
a random word here and there;

21:16.536 --> 21:21.976
my nests record your deepest
insecurities, in high-def.

21:22.019 --> 21:25.632
Women are so stupid
and malleable,

21:25.675 --> 21:27.677
once you know what
makes them feel bad,

21:27.721 --> 21:29.505
they'll buy anything to fix it.

21:29.549 --> 21:31.681
When I take LeapIN global,

21:31.725 --> 21:34.031
I'll have nests
across the world,

21:34.075 --> 21:36.686
and it all starts with
the three million idiots

21:36.730 --> 21:38.645
who watch your show.

21:38.688 --> 21:41.909
Now, how long
before the camera's ready?

21:41.952 --> 21:45.565
Actually, it's been recording
this entire time.

21:45.608 --> 21:48.307
Say hi, Argenthina.

21:48.350 --> 21:50.396
You recorded that?

21:50.439 --> 21:51.919
Sure did.

21:51.962 --> 21:53.268
And if you don't want
the entire Internet

21:53.312 --> 21:54.791
to know that their
"feminist icon"

21:54.835 --> 21:57.620
is actually some
woman-hating fraud,

21:57.664 --> 22:00.188
then you'll give Harper back
her drive right now.

22:00.231 --> 22:02.756
Okay, Nancy Drew.

22:02.799 --> 22:05.236
See, Spencer?
It is a compliment.

22:07.282 --> 22:10.241
I say we expose Argenthina

22:10.285 --> 22:13.332
with maybe a miniseries
on a premium streaming network.

22:13.375 --> 22:15.116
[CARLY]:
Ooh, really drag it out.

22:15.159 --> 22:18.032
-Ten episodes. Maybe even
a second season. -Mm-hmm. Yeah.

22:18.075 --> 22:19.686
Fine.

22:19.729 --> 22:23.603
Delete the footage
and I'll give you the drive.

22:28.825 --> 22:31.350
Oh, I'm so happy
I got my drive back!

22:31.393 --> 22:34.440
See? It's a little stiletto.

22:34.483 --> 22:36.659
Just want to put it out there,
I don't mind

22:36.703 --> 22:38.313
if you still want to spy on me.

22:38.357 --> 22:41.403
[BOTH]:
Spencer.

22:43.536 --> 22:47.409
All right, ladies, even though
it is a big sacrifice,

22:47.453 --> 22:50.064
I am willing to give up
my walk-in pantry.

22:50.107 --> 22:51.457
It's not like it was
getting any use.

22:51.500 --> 22:53.284
White people
don't season their food.

22:53.328 --> 22:55.635
What she meant to say
was "thank you."

22:55.678 --> 22:57.376
Ooh, I'm gonna love
working here.

22:57.419 --> 23:00.466
Especially 'cause it costs
zero dollars.

23:00.509 --> 23:02.424
We don't need Argentina
or LeapIN.

23:02.468 --> 23:04.470
Wait, is LeapIN bad?

23:04.513 --> 23:08.082
Argentina was using
the nests to mine our data.

23:08.125 --> 23:10.780
Oh, I don't care.
I love targeted ads.

23:10.824 --> 23:12.782
That's how I found these clogs.

23:12.826 --> 23:14.523
But you were in tears.

23:14.567 --> 23:18.397
Remember? Y-You told me,
"don't leap in."

23:18.440 --> 23:20.224
That's 'cause I get
free guest passes.

23:20.268 --> 23:22.052
Plus, I'm just
an emotional person.

23:22.096 --> 23:24.446
[crying softly]
Sorry, I'm just thinking about

23:24.490 --> 23:26.840
if I never found the clogs.

23:26.883 --> 23:29.582
Well, you shouldn't pay to be
part of a community.

23:29.625 --> 23:32.193
Women should help each other,
not profit off each other.

23:32.236 --> 23:33.542
I know that's right.

23:33.586 --> 23:35.979
Who's interested
in purchasing a time-share

23:36.023 --> 23:38.112
from a female-owned
small business?

23:38.155 --> 23:39.505
Ooh, me. Sign me up.

23:39.548 --> 23:41.681
Do you take Amex?

23:41.724 --> 23:44.031
That's my young person.
