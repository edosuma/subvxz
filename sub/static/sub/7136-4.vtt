02:34.767 --> 02:36.667
- Mercy
is the compassion we feel

02:36.734 --> 02:38.800
for someone else's misfortune.

02:38.867 --> 02:42.767
Mercy compels us
to alleviate that misfortune.

02:42.834 --> 02:45.767
Mercy is a child of charity,
but the sister of justice

02:45.834 --> 02:48.000
because both are about
the invisible link

02:48.066 --> 02:50.467
that exists between people.

02:50.533 --> 02:56.166
Mercy is spontaneous
because misery is involuntary.

02:56.233 --> 02:58.600
- At approximately 3:15 p.m.,

02:58.667 --> 03:00.467
as your children were
walking home from school

03:00.533 --> 03:04.300
with four classmates, a blue
van pulled up beside them.

03:04.367 --> 03:06.066
A male Caucasian stepped out.

03:06.133 --> 03:08.700
The man approached Gary
and Holly saying that you,

03:08.767 --> 03:11.333
Mrs. Beecher, had asked him
to pick them up.

03:11.400 --> 03:14.100
Gary was reluctant at first,
but eventually

03:14.166 --> 03:17.233
the man persuaded him,
using Pokemon cards.

03:17.300 --> 03:20.600
The van then drove off
to the east side of town.

03:20.667 --> 03:23.734
- So what's being done
to find them?

03:23.800 --> 03:26.233
- Kidnapping
is a waiting game, Sister.

03:26.300 --> 03:28.233
We have to wait
to be contacted.

03:28.300 --> 03:29.367
- And what if you're not?

03:29.433 --> 03:31.400
- Milk cartons.
- Toby.

03:31.467 --> 03:33.300
- Come on,
Schillinger did this.

03:33.367 --> 03:35.367
- We have no proof of that.
- Oh, for fuck's sake.

03:35.433 --> 03:36.500
Who else?!

03:36.567 --> 03:38.533
- You come from
a wealthy family.

03:38.600 --> 03:40.867
Most likely we have
a ransom situation.

03:40.934 --> 03:44.166
- You are fucking this up,
you asshole!

03:46.433 --> 03:48.367
Find my goddamn kids!

03:48.433 --> 03:49.633
- Oh, my God!

03:49.700 --> 03:51.533
- Find my goddamn kids!

03:51.600 --> 03:53.600
- Get them out! Out!

03:56.834 --> 03:59.333
- Find my kids!

04:02.367 --> 04:04.266
Ughhh!

04:04.333 --> 04:07.600
- I don't know anything
about a kidnapping.

04:07.667 --> 04:09.967
- Beecher seems to
think you do.

04:10.033 --> 04:11.533
That you're behind this.

04:11.600 --> 04:14.667
- He and I have had a lot of
shit happen between us, so...

04:14.734 --> 04:17.400
I can understand him
saying that.

04:17.467 --> 04:21.100
But Beecher and I have
one thing in common, too.

04:21.166 --> 04:22.700
We're both fathers.

04:22.767 --> 04:24.967
I lost a son.

04:25.033 --> 04:28.467
I know what
he's going through.

04:30.700 --> 04:32.867
- I'm sorry about what
happened in the library.

04:32.967 --> 04:35.200
I just got so frustrated.

04:35.233 --> 04:36.367
- I know, I know.

04:36.433 --> 04:38.166
You might want to
call your mother.

04:38.233 --> 04:39.533
She's pretty upset.

04:39.600 --> 04:40.700
We talked about it
in the car.

04:40.767 --> 04:44.467
Toby, the reasons
you're in here, the...

04:44.533 --> 04:46.300
the alcoholism

04:46.367 --> 04:50.166
and hitting the little
Brockwell girl...

04:50.233 --> 04:52.867
your mother and I
can't help but think

04:52.934 --> 04:56.166
that we're...to blame
for so much of it.

04:56.233 --> 04:57.500
- Dad--
- No.

04:57.567 --> 04:59.333
We failed you growing up.

04:59.400 --> 05:01.667
- Look, as much as
I'd like to blame you

05:01.734 --> 05:04.700
for the miserable shithole
my life has become,

05:04.767 --> 05:08.233
what's wrong with me
is inside me.

05:08.300 --> 05:10.333
I own it.

05:10.400 --> 05:14.133
And either I have to control it
or it will control me.

05:15.934 --> 05:17.934
Right now, I just want
to hold my babies.

05:20.967 --> 05:27.000
- So...our sweet young things
are safe and sound?

05:27.066 --> 05:28.433
- Yeah.

05:28.500 --> 05:29.734
- All right.

05:29.800 --> 05:34.200
Time to kick this thing
into overdrive.

05:34.266 --> 05:37.000
I want you to send the package.

05:37.066 --> 05:39.133
- Dad, you sure?

05:39.200 --> 05:40.567
- Yes.

05:40.633 --> 05:43.066
- 'Cause I been thinking.

05:43.133 --> 05:46.200
Like you know I've never had
a problem with breaking the law.

05:46.266 --> 05:50.033
I'm talking about at most
a couple stolen Camrys.

05:50.100 --> 05:51.200
This kidnapping...

05:51.266 --> 05:53.600
- Keep your voice down.

05:54.834 --> 05:57.333
- This kind of thing's
really not my style.

05:57.400 --> 05:59.266
- I'll pay you double.

06:01.967 --> 06:03.367
- Okay.

06:06.967 --> 06:09.700
- Are you Les Hibitz?

06:09.767 --> 06:11.967
- Yeah.
- Tobias Beecher.

06:12.033 --> 06:14.300
Mind if I join you?

06:14.367 --> 06:16.800
- You want to sit with me?
- Yeah.

06:16.867 --> 06:19.867
- Ha ha. Nobody ever
wants to sit with me.

06:23.433 --> 06:26.633
- I understand you did some Fed
time for kidnapping, right?

06:26.700 --> 06:29.066
- Yeah, I was framed.

06:29.133 --> 06:30.567
- Yeah, I'm sure you were.

06:30.633 --> 06:33.400
But I, um, don't know
if you've heard,

06:33.467 --> 06:35.166
but my two children
were abducted recently.

06:35.233 --> 06:37.133
- I had nothing to do with it.

06:37.200 --> 06:39.033
- I know, what I'm asking is--

06:39.100 --> 06:42.100
I was wondering if you might
be able to look into it.

06:42.166 --> 06:44.367
Find out if somebody
was hired to do the job.

06:44.433 --> 06:47.066
- I could ask around,
see what I could find out,

06:47.133 --> 06:50.633
but...I wouldn't
hold out much hope.

06:52.300 --> 06:55.800
So do you like Def Leppard?

06:56.800 --> 06:58.967
- Years and years and years ago,

06:59.033 --> 07:00.533
the Catholic church made a list

07:00.600 --> 07:02.567
of all the ways
we can show mercy.

07:02.633 --> 07:04.867
Feed the hungry,
give drink to the thirsty,

07:04.934 --> 07:07.066
clothe the naked,
shit like that.

07:07.133 --> 07:09.700
Another of them
was ransom the captive.

07:09.767 --> 07:12.333
In those days,
pirates and infidels and such

07:12.400 --> 07:15.533
would abduct fair maidens
and Christian pilgrims.

07:15.600 --> 07:19.900
God-fearing people were expected
to pay for their return.

07:19.967 --> 07:22.800
Who gets to ransom the captive
in this day and age?

07:22.867 --> 07:26.467
Instead, we're expected
to visit the imprisoned.

07:26.533 --> 07:28.533
That's right.

07:28.600 --> 07:30.667
Come on down!

07:41.367 --> 07:43.233
Break it up, you two.

07:52.467 --> 07:55.066
- You okay?
- Oh, shit, yeah.

07:55.133 --> 07:57.667
Hey, man, they stab me,
they shoot me--

07:57.734 --> 08:01.100
I ain't going down.

08:01.166 --> 08:02.233
How you doing?

08:07.500 --> 08:09.066
- My kids.

08:09.133 --> 08:10.266
- I heard.
That's fucked up.

08:10.333 --> 08:12.100
I'm sorry, man.

08:13.567 --> 08:16.100
- I feel so goddamn helpless.

08:17.333 --> 08:19.033
- I bet.

08:19.100 --> 08:22.900
- At least the baby...
Harry's safe.

08:22.967 --> 08:24.734
- Toby, they're gonna
be all right, you hear me?

08:24.800 --> 08:26.433
They're gonna be okay.

08:26.500 --> 08:28.266
They're gonna be fine.

08:31.066 --> 08:33.266
Ah...

08:36.667 --> 08:38.633
- Oh, man.

08:39.800 --> 08:42.100
- I missed you.

08:42.166 --> 08:44.233
- Me, too.

09:02.867 --> 09:05.233
- Keller's back
in Emerald City.

09:05.300 --> 09:08.266
Two lovebirds
have reunited.

09:08.333 --> 09:10.734
- And I hope they enjoy
their evening together.

09:10.800 --> 09:13.900
It's gonna be
the last night of sleep...

09:13.967 --> 09:19.100
or peace that Beecher's gonna
have for a long, long time.

09:42.500 --> 09:44.000
- Chris?

09:44.066 --> 09:46.667
- Sorry, did I wake you?

09:52.100 --> 09:53.700
- Hey.

09:53.767 --> 09:56.600
What's the matter?

09:56.667 --> 09:59.300
- Toby, I died.

10:00.600 --> 10:03.633
And there's no white light.

10:05.200 --> 10:06.800
I was there,
but they brought me back.

10:06.867 --> 10:07.900
But I was there, Toby.

10:07.967 --> 10:09.400
I was in hell,
and I felt everything.

10:09.467 --> 10:12.000
I felt the pain and I felt
the fire for all eternity.

10:12.066 --> 10:14.266
- Hey, hey.
It's gonna be okay.

10:14.333 --> 10:16.433
- No, it's not gonna be okay.
Don't fucking lie to me.

10:16.500 --> 10:18.734
I was there, Toby.
They're bringing me back.

10:18.800 --> 10:20.533
- You know what's funny?

10:23.166 --> 10:25.700
You got pissed at me for
talking to Said about God,

10:25.767 --> 10:28.300
but that's what I was
talking to him about.

10:28.367 --> 10:34.967
'Cause if all that's left
for us in this life is Oz,

10:35.033 --> 10:39.667
then we better start
thinking about what's next,

10:39.734 --> 10:41.667
what comes after.

10:48.000 --> 10:49.667
- Don't let go.

10:52.000 --> 10:54.133
- Okay, okay.

11:06.300 --> 11:07.734
- Tobias.

11:07.800 --> 11:11.033
I didn't expect to see you here
today given what's going on.

11:11.100 --> 11:13.900
- Yeah, well,
work helps keep my mind

11:13.967 --> 11:15.667
from caving in on itself.

11:15.734 --> 11:17.166
- Oh, I hear that.

11:17.233 --> 11:19.367
It's a madhouse outside,

11:19.433 --> 11:21.100
though the crowd of
protesters is smaller.

11:21.166 --> 11:23.934
I'm afraid people are getting
used to capital punishment.

11:24.000 --> 11:27.000
- Sister Pete,
I need to ask you a favor.

11:27.066 --> 11:29.066
- If I can,
you know I will.

11:29.133 --> 11:30.900
What?

11:30.967 --> 11:33.900
- Talk to Chris.

11:33.967 --> 11:35.734
- Now, how is it
that you ask me

11:35.800 --> 11:37.767
the one thing
that I won't do?

11:37.834 --> 11:39.934
- He feels terrible.

11:40.000 --> 11:43.934
- Tobias, he tried to
use me to get to you.

11:44.000 --> 11:45.967
Now he's using you
to get to me.

11:46.033 --> 11:48.567
I will not  play his game.

11:48.633 --> 11:50.900
- He's afraid that
if you leave the convent,

11:50.967 --> 11:52.233
he's gonna burn forever.

11:52.300 --> 11:54.867
- Oh, he's gonna burn all right,
but not for that.

11:54.934 --> 11:57.767
He's gonna burn for all of
the other people he's hurt,

11:57.834 --> 11:59.533
all of the other lives
he's destroyed,

11:59.600 --> 12:01.333
including yours.

12:09.934 --> 12:11.400
- We've been going
through the records

12:11.467 --> 12:13.467
of various prisoners
at Emerald City.

12:13.533 --> 12:16.166
One pops out as a potential
connection to the kidnapping.

12:16.233 --> 12:17.367
- Who?

12:17.433 --> 12:18.734
- Christopher Keller.

12:18.800 --> 12:20.433
- No.

12:20.500 --> 12:21.567
Chris is my friend.

12:21.633 --> 12:23.900
- Let me see that.

12:23.967 --> 12:26.700
- Keller broke every
bone in your body.

12:26.767 --> 12:28.100
- He's the one?

12:28.166 --> 12:29.600
- He also saved my life
from Schillinger.

12:29.667 --> 12:32.333
I'm telling you,
Schillinger is responsible.

12:32.400 --> 12:35.200
- "Armed robbery,
assault, kidnapping."

12:35.266 --> 12:37.100
- He wasn't convicted.

12:37.166 --> 12:39.433
- "Police suspect him of raping,
torturing and murdering

12:39.500 --> 12:41.133
several homosexual men"?

12:41.200 --> 12:44.266
- It can't be him.
It's not him.

12:44.333 --> 12:47.400
- How can you be so sure?

12:48.367 --> 12:50.000
- I know Chris, Mother...

12:51.300 --> 12:53.066
Intimately.

12:53.133 --> 12:54.967
- Intimately?

12:57.967 --> 12:59.667
- He's my lover.

13:16.767 --> 13:19.033
- Holy shit.

13:19.100 --> 13:21.467
Vern, you better
come see this.

13:21.533 --> 13:22.600
- What do you got?

13:22.667 --> 13:24.934
- Package
for Tobias Beecher.

13:25.000 --> 13:26.100
Look.

13:26.166 --> 13:28.066
- Jesus Christ.

13:28.133 --> 13:32.033
Officer Howell?
We got a problem here.

13:35.266 --> 13:36.800
- What the hell is that?

13:36.867 --> 13:39.166
- A child's hand.

14:23.934 --> 14:26.066
- Leave us alone.

14:29.633 --> 14:31.834
How you holding up?

14:34.100 --> 14:36.133
- A few days in the Hole

14:36.200 --> 14:38.600
only increases
my credibility with Pancamo,

14:38.667 --> 14:40.900
Adebisi, and Morales.

14:40.967 --> 14:42.700
Ever spent any
time in here?

14:42.767 --> 14:44.800
- No.

14:44.867 --> 14:46.533
- Good.

14:52.667 --> 14:55.400
You look like shit.

14:55.467 --> 14:57.900
- So I'm in?
- "So I'm in."

14:57.967 --> 15:00.400
Adebisi
ain't convinced, man.

15:00.467 --> 15:02.533
Looks like you're gonna
have to take another test.

15:02.600 --> 15:05.266
Oh, yeah.

15:06.467 --> 15:08.767
- We going to box?
- We wanna see

15:08.834 --> 15:10.033
if you can take a punch.

15:10.100 --> 15:12.266
- Or two.

15:12.333 --> 15:14.400
- You got a problem
with me, man?

15:14.467 --> 15:15.934
- Oh ho ho ho!

15:16.000 --> 15:18.300
- Yeah, you're weak.

15:18.367 --> 15:20.700
- Give me gloves.

15:20.767 --> 15:23.767
- Well, actually,
we're not gonna spar.

15:23.834 --> 15:25.934
- No?
- No.

15:26.000 --> 15:29.233
I'm gonna use you
for a heavy bag.

15:29.300 --> 15:32.467
- And the rest of us bet on
how long you stay standing.

15:34.166 --> 15:35.100
- Ready?

15:37.333 --> 15:38.266
- Yeah.

15:38.333 --> 15:40.433
- Ding, ding.

15:40.500 --> 15:42.266
inmates: Oh!

15:48.133 --> 15:49.333
- He's gettin' up.

15:51.734 --> 15:52.700
- Oh!

15:57.367 --> 15:59.233
- 15 seconds.

15:59.300 --> 16:01.100
I win.
Pay up.

16:11.734 --> 16:13.467
- Ow!

16:13.533 --> 16:15.767
Yo, real impressive.

16:15.834 --> 16:17.533
- Yeah, thanks.

16:17.600 --> 16:21.066
Your bruises must hurt.

16:21.133 --> 16:23.433
- Uh-huh.
- Yeah.

16:23.500 --> 16:26.633
Brought you a little something
to sooth your wounds.

16:30.033 --> 16:32.033
Later.

16:59.867 --> 17:01.333
- Yo.

17:03.333 --> 17:05.100
What the fuck
is you doing?

17:05.934 --> 17:08.900
- Breakfast of champions.

17:30.734 --> 17:32.000
You wanted to see me?

17:32.066 --> 17:34.300
- We just took a straw
poll on you.

17:34.367 --> 17:36.467
- I voted yes.

17:36.533 --> 17:38.567
- I voted no.
- I abstained.

17:38.633 --> 17:40.333
- A tie.

17:40.400 --> 17:42.667
- How do I break this tie?

17:43.967 --> 17:45.700
- There's a final test.

17:45.767 --> 17:47.567
- Which is?

17:49.834 --> 17:51.700
- You gotta kill somebody.

17:51.767 --> 17:53.200
- Who?

17:53.266 --> 17:54.567
- Anybody.

17:54.633 --> 17:56.200
We don't care.

17:59.533 --> 18:02.934
- All right.
I'll do it.

18:29.266 --> 18:31.166
- Pete.

18:31.233 --> 18:32.834
I have terrible news.

18:32.900 --> 18:34.000
- Oh, my God, what?

18:34.066 --> 18:37.433
- The Cardinal is coming.

18:37.500 --> 18:39.633
- Cardinal Abgott
is coming to Oz?

18:39.700 --> 18:41.300
- He wants to say a mass,

18:41.367 --> 18:43.266
meet with the staff,
and then with some prisoners.

18:43.333 --> 18:46.300
- You're friends
with him, right?

18:46.367 --> 18:48.200
- I worked with him
in his office

18:48.266 --> 18:49.734
until
he transferred me here.

18:49.800 --> 18:53.867
I...disagreed with him
once too often.

18:55.800 --> 18:58.200
- I'm taking the day off.

18:58.266 --> 19:00.166
Oh, no, you can't!

19:00.233 --> 19:03.100
- Ray, I have one foot
out of the convent door.

19:03.166 --> 19:05.100
I think hobnobbing
with the Cardinal

19:05.166 --> 19:07.233
would be just a little
hypocritical, don't you?

19:07.300 --> 19:10.467
- Yeah, well, he specifically
asked to meet you.

19:10.533 --> 19:12.300
- Me?
Why?

19:12.367 --> 19:14.700
- Well, apparently
this whole thing started

19:14.767 --> 19:17.967
because his Eminence received
a letter from a prisoner.

19:19.767 --> 19:20.934
- Which one?

19:21.000 --> 19:23.467
- Chris Keller.

19:23.533 --> 19:26.233
- Chris Keller.
Of course.

19:31.066 --> 19:32.734
- Raymond.

19:32.800 --> 19:35.934
- Cardinal Abgott,
it's good of you to come.

19:36.000 --> 19:39.066
- It's a pleasure
to see you, son.

19:39.133 --> 19:40.667
Let's suit up.

19:47.667 --> 19:51.200
Do you know why
I transferred you to Oswald?

19:53.433 --> 19:55.500
- I had too many opinions?

19:57.100 --> 19:59.000
- You had too big an ego.

20:00.533 --> 20:01.633
- Probably.

20:01.700 --> 20:04.166
- Something tells me
that's changed.

20:07.166 --> 20:09.100
Body of Christ.
- Amen.

20:12.700 --> 20:14.166
- The body of Christ.

20:14.233 --> 20:15.734
- Amen.

20:17.133 --> 20:19.900
- Body of Christ.
- Amen.

20:23.834 --> 20:27.467
- The body of Christ.
- Amen.

20:31.000 --> 20:33.367
- The body of Christ.
- Amen.

20:33.433 --> 20:34.834
I spoke to the head
of your order,

20:34.900 --> 20:37.133
Sister Leo Carria.

20:37.200 --> 20:40.533
She says you're questioning
your own vocation.

20:42.166 --> 20:44.266
- Yes, I am.

20:45.400 --> 20:46.934
- Welcome to the club.

20:47.000 --> 20:48.734
- You?

20:48.800 --> 20:52.000
- My first parish was way out
in the country,

20:52.066 --> 20:54.066
a desolate area.

20:54.133 --> 20:58.700
The pastor was old,
the housekeeper even older.

20:58.767 --> 21:01.533
When winter hit,
it was lonely.

21:01.600 --> 21:04.633
I cried...

21:04.700 --> 21:07.400
and I prayed.

21:07.467 --> 21:10.400
I cried some more...

21:10.467 --> 21:12.633
and prayed even harder.

21:12.700 --> 21:15.533
- Well, that's--
that's what I'm doing.

21:15.600 --> 21:17.967
- Good.

21:18.033 --> 21:21.633
Then whatever you decide
will be the right thing to do.

21:26.066 --> 21:28.033
- Thank you.

21:29.734 --> 21:32.533
- God bless you, Sister.

21:37.800 --> 21:39.800
- God bless you,
Sister.

21:42.266 --> 21:45.367
- As you already know, the jury
has ruled in our favor.

21:45.433 --> 21:49.467
They recognize that
the state was guilty

21:49.533 --> 21:52.934
in all injuries and deaths
caused after the riot.

21:53.000 --> 21:55.767
So they have made
recommendations

21:55.834 --> 21:58.567
that we receive
the full settlement:

21:58.633 --> 22:02.333
$45 million.

22:02.400 --> 22:03.800
- Oh, yeah!

22:03.867 --> 22:08.333
- Before you all go spending
that money, know this:

22:08.400 --> 22:10.066
the State has appealed
the decision.

22:10.133 --> 22:12.166
- Appealed?
- Yes, appealed.

22:12.233 --> 22:13.700
It is an election year.

22:13.767 --> 22:15.333
There is no way that Devlin
will write us a check,

22:15.400 --> 22:17.333
not before November.

22:17.400 --> 22:19.300
- Said, you can't goose
this thing along?

22:19.367 --> 22:21.333
- As we are all aware,

22:21.400 --> 22:22.700
the legal system
moves very slow.

22:22.767 --> 22:24.700
There's no way we can know
when our case is gonna be

22:24.767 --> 22:26.300
coming before
the appellate court.

22:26.367 --> 22:29.500
- Took almost 30 years for
the prisoners of Attica to win.

22:29.567 --> 22:31.533
- 30 fucking years?

22:31.600 --> 22:33.700
Christ, I'll be ancient.

22:33.767 --> 22:35.500
Like you, Rebadow.

22:35.567 --> 22:38.400
- Look, I know
this is frustrating,

22:38.467 --> 22:41.400
but I want you all to see
the court decision this week--

22:41.467 --> 22:43.000
that was a huge hurdle,

22:43.066 --> 22:46.700
a huge victory.

22:46.767 --> 22:48.900
We must remain resolved.

22:48.967 --> 22:51.633
I'll inform you
of anything else.

22:58.233 --> 22:59.300
Yes?

22:59.367 --> 23:03.100
- Have you ever
killed anyone?

23:03.200 --> 23:04.633
No.

23:04.700 --> 23:06.800
- An extraordinary experience

23:06.867 --> 23:09.934
watching the life fade
from someone's eyes.

23:11.934 --> 23:15.066
- Aah!

23:18.834 --> 23:20.266
- Even as he was dying,

23:20.333 --> 23:23.166
Hernandez's instinct was to
kill me for killing him.

23:29.767 --> 23:32.600
Survival meant less
to him than revenge.

23:34.033 --> 23:37.133
- And this preamble
is taking us where?

23:37.233 --> 23:38.967
- Jason Cramer.

23:39.033 --> 23:40.967
You've successfully
gotten him a new trial.

23:41.033 --> 23:43.100
- Yes.
- I know you've been

23:43.166 --> 23:44.934
under a lot of pressure
from the other Muslims

23:45.000 --> 23:48.033
not to get involved
with the case.

23:48.100 --> 23:49.200
- Yes.

23:49.266 --> 23:51.567
- I think you should
listen to them.

23:51.633 --> 23:54.000
- And you think
this because...

23:54.066 --> 23:55.967
- Last night
I had a premonition.

23:56.033 --> 23:58.734
Cramer will go free.

23:58.800 --> 24:01.200
- Rebadow, I'm gonna
tell you something.

24:01.266 --> 24:03.433
I'm gonna explain to you.

24:03.500 --> 24:07.300
Jason Cramer is guilty
of murdering his lover.

24:07.367 --> 24:09.233
I have seen
the trial transcripts

24:09.300 --> 24:10.900
and all the evidence.

24:10.967 --> 24:13.367
He will be
convicted again.

24:13.433 --> 24:16.467
- Then why did you fight
to get him a new trial?

24:16.533 --> 24:18.934
- The jury voted against
Cramer because he was gay.

24:19.000 --> 24:21.767
- So this whole thing
is theoretical for you.

24:21.834 --> 24:24.333
- There is nothing
theoretical about justice.

24:24.400 --> 24:26.333
- And if Cramer goes free...

24:28.767 --> 24:30.333
- That's not gonna happen.

24:30.400 --> 24:32.667
- You'd better pray
you're right.

24:39.266 --> 24:42.266
- We have a request for
a meeting regarding your case.

24:42.333 --> 24:44.233
- Yeah, a meeting with who?

24:44.300 --> 24:47.567
- The homicide detective
who arrested you.

24:47.633 --> 24:49.800
Robert Stransky.

24:49.867 --> 24:51.800
- Here's the deal.

24:51.867 --> 24:54.633
You got this cocksucker
a new trial, right?

24:56.066 --> 24:57.266
My doctor tells me

24:57.333 --> 25:01.533
I got three or four
more months to live.

25:01.600 --> 25:04.934
Now, before I die,

25:05.000 --> 25:07.133
want to make certain
things straight.

25:08.767 --> 25:13.367
Want you to know I tampered
with the evidence.

25:14.967 --> 25:17.700
I couldn't find
the murder weapon,

25:17.767 --> 25:19.300
so I went to the kitchen.

25:19.367 --> 25:22.600
I opened a drawer
and took out a kitchen knife

25:22.667 --> 25:24.633
and I smeared it
in the blood

25:24.700 --> 25:26.600
and I dropped it
next to his body.

25:26.667 --> 25:28.767
- His fingerprints
are all over that knife.

25:28.834 --> 25:31.667
No.

25:33.767 --> 25:35.066
No, they weren't.

25:36.767 --> 25:40.967
My pal in forensics
doctored up the tests.

25:43.734 --> 25:46.600
- And you would be willing
to give a deposition?

25:46.667 --> 25:48.533
To go into court
and say this?

25:48.600 --> 25:52.200
- I know this fucker's
guilty as shit,

25:52.266 --> 25:56.000
but I want to buy back
a piece of my soul.

25:56.066 --> 25:59.200
Yeah, if you want me to,

25:59.266 --> 26:01.967
I'll yell it
from the prison roof.

26:02.033 --> 26:04.533
Okay, sweetheart?

26:08.166 --> 26:10.367
We go public
with this information,

26:10.433 --> 26:12.767
the press will get
a seven-inch boner.

26:12.834 --> 26:15.200
- Yes.
- And you say the only witness,

26:15.266 --> 26:17.300
the guy at Airborne, is dead?

26:17.367 --> 26:18.300
- Yes.

26:18.367 --> 26:20.667
- Ohh...I don't know, man.

26:20.734 --> 26:24.567
I'm feeling like maybe this
could swing in my favor.

26:24.633 --> 26:27.133
- Yes.

26:27.200 --> 26:31.734
Cramer, I'm recusing
myself from the case.

26:33.233 --> 26:34.700
- W-what's that mean?

26:36.300 --> 26:39.600
- It means I am resigning
as your lawyer...

26:39.667 --> 26:41.300
immediately.

26:46.433 --> 26:49.934
- To instruct the ignorant,
counsel the doubtful,

26:50.000 --> 26:51.734
to admonish the sinners.

26:51.800 --> 26:53.867
In order for these works
of mercy to happen,

26:53.934 --> 26:55.633
you need two things:

26:55.700 --> 27:00.266
someone in distress and someone
with the capacity to help them.

27:00.333 --> 27:01.700
In other words,

27:01.767 --> 27:05.000
an ignoramus can't
instruct another ignoramus,

27:05.066 --> 27:09.567
and a sinner
can't admonish a sinner.

27:09.633 --> 27:11.433
- Today in the retrial
of Jason Cramer,

27:11.500 --> 27:13.133
who had previously
been convicted

27:13.200 --> 27:15.600
for the murder of his lover,
the jury reached a verdict,

27:15.667 --> 27:17.834
finding Cramer not guilty.

27:17.900 --> 27:20.700
The Adamsville native, who has
served nearly two years,

27:20.767 --> 27:23.700
is expected to be released from
the Oswald Correctional Facility

27:23.767 --> 27:25.333
sometime this week.

27:25.400 --> 27:27.834
In other news, the state's
jobless rate fell slightly

27:27.900 --> 27:30.433
over the past month to 3.8%.

27:30.500 --> 27:32.266
Preliminary figures
released yesterday

27:32.333 --> 27:34.033
by the state's labor department

27:34.100 --> 27:38.600
show that employers
created nearly 1,000 new jobs.

27:55.400 --> 27:58.600
- Allah is not listening,
brother.

27:58.667 --> 28:00.867
He is deaf to you.

28:34.166 --> 28:35.400
- Warden.

28:35.467 --> 28:37.834
A word?

28:39.533 --> 28:42.967
Um...I know that you've been
having meetings recently

28:43.033 --> 28:44.967
with members of
the local community

28:45.033 --> 28:47.700
regarding possible replacements
for Tim McManus.

28:47.767 --> 28:49.433
- Yes.
- Well, I also know

28:49.500 --> 28:51.700
that you talked about hiring
an African-American

28:51.767 --> 28:53.433
for the job.
- What--

28:53.500 --> 28:55.066
you got my office bugged?

28:55.133 --> 28:56.500
- I want to come
and see you, Warden,

28:56.567 --> 28:59.333
discuss with you the kind of
man who you should consider.

28:59.400 --> 29:00.967
- Well, I'd love that, Said,

29:01.033 --> 29:02.967
but you see,
I've already hired someone.

29:03.033 --> 29:04.867
In fact, he's on his way in now.

29:04.934 --> 29:07.133
His name is Martin Querns.

29:07.166 --> 29:09.367
- I want to thank you for
this opportunity, Warden.

29:09.433 --> 29:11.834
I've heard about
Emerald City for years now.

29:11.900 --> 29:13.200
- Well, the place started
out as an experiment,

29:13.266 --> 29:15.567
but, unfortunately,
it pretty much failed.

29:15.633 --> 29:16.667
- Well, I don't know.

29:16.734 --> 29:19.467
Maybe the first stage failed,

29:19.533 --> 29:21.266
but like any
worthwhile experiment,

29:21.333 --> 29:25.033
we need to try different methods
till we figure out what works.

29:25.100 --> 29:29.266
- Well, for me the most
important elements are,

29:29.333 --> 29:32.266
one, keeping a lid
on the racial tension;

29:32.333 --> 29:35.233
and, two, keeping a lid on
the violence in general.

29:35.300 --> 29:37.367
- Those are
my priorities as well.

29:37.433 --> 29:39.800
Do I have your permission
to do what I feel is necessary

29:39.867 --> 29:41.500
to keep the peace?

29:41.567 --> 29:45.600
- Yes. I'll let you have
a fairly free hand.

29:45.667 --> 29:48.233
Until you fuck up.

29:48.300 --> 29:50.934
- Well, I can't ask for
any more than that.

30:21.900 --> 30:24.433
- Okay, everybody,
listen up.

30:24.500 --> 30:26.367
I want to introduce you
to Martin Querns,

30:26.433 --> 30:27.600
the new unit manager.

30:27.667 --> 30:30.000
He has a vast range
of experience,

30:30.066 --> 30:32.500
having worked
in both federal prisons

30:32.567 --> 30:35.100
as well as state
detention centers.

30:38.667 --> 30:39.934
- The Warden is correct.

30:40.000 --> 30:43.433
I have served in many
correctional facilities,

30:43.500 --> 30:46.934
but what he didn't say
was that like most of you,

30:47.000 --> 30:49.233
I come from the streets.

30:49.300 --> 30:51.166
I'm not some
candy-ass white liberal

30:51.233 --> 30:53.934
looking to turn you
into better citizens.

30:54.000 --> 30:56.633
I intend to meet with
each of you individually,

30:56.700 --> 31:00.867
but until that time,
keep one principle in mind:

31:00.934 --> 31:03.433
don't fuck with Querns.

31:05.533 --> 31:07.567
That's all.

31:07.633 --> 31:10.266
I wanted to
meet with you first

31:10.333 --> 31:13.467
because as I understand,

31:13.533 --> 31:15.200
you're one of
the leaders around here

31:15.266 --> 31:18.166
in terms of the drug trade.

31:18.233 --> 31:21.066
As a teenager, I worked
for Slim Sam Colby.

31:21.133 --> 31:22.734
You know him?

31:22.800 --> 31:28.000
Slim Sam weighed about
300 pounds, of course.

31:28.066 --> 31:30.700
I worked my way up
through his organization

31:30.767 --> 31:34.900
until Ricky Jay Lee
blew Slim Sam's head off.

31:34.967 --> 31:38.233
I decided the moment
had come to retire.

31:38.300 --> 31:40.567
- And the point of all this?

31:40.633 --> 31:43.400
- To let you know I know
every trick you got.

31:43.467 --> 31:47.000
To let you know
I'm smarter than you.

31:47.066 --> 31:50.767
- You smarter than me?
- Oh, yeah.

31:50.834 --> 31:54.533
'Cause unlike you,
I never got caught.

31:54.600 --> 31:57.734
How do you keep that
thing on your head?

31:57.800 --> 31:59.867
Now, what are you gonna do?

31:59.934 --> 32:02.100
Hit me?

32:02.166 --> 32:04.867
Sit down.

32:05.734 --> 32:09.433
I want you to listen
to me good, Simon Adebisi.

32:09.500 --> 32:11.800
To my mind,
drugged-out prisoners

32:11.867 --> 32:13.967
make for
a quiet cell block,

32:14.033 --> 32:16.867
so you can sell
whatever the fuck you want

32:16.934 --> 32:19.500
to whoever you want to
sell it to--I don't care.

32:19.567 --> 32:21.333
I'm gonna be looking
the other way.

32:21.400 --> 32:23.500
- On one condition, right?

32:23.567 --> 32:26.166
- Jeez, you are  smart.

32:26.233 --> 32:27.967
One condition:

32:28.033 --> 32:32.333
no violence.
I mean none, zero.

32:32.400 --> 32:33.467
Agreed?

32:37.333 --> 32:38.800
- That's it, no violence?

32:38.867 --> 32:41.433
- Yup. He just want me
to make sure

32:41.500 --> 32:45.033
that everybody obeys all
the rules all the time.

32:45.100 --> 32:47.734
- This could be
a trick.

32:47.800 --> 32:49.000
- Yeah.

32:49.066 --> 32:50.700
I don't think so.

32:50.767 --> 32:52.667
- Like the way things were
back in the old days.

32:52.734 --> 32:55.166
We Sicilians controlled
our own streets,

32:55.233 --> 32:57.333
so the cops backed away.

32:57.400 --> 32:59.133
Little italy was the safest
place in the city.

32:59.200 --> 33:00.700
- Look, I vote yes.

33:00.767 --> 33:01.967
- Me, too.

33:03.367 --> 33:04.867
- All right.

33:08.066 --> 33:09.500
- I'm glad you called.

33:09.567 --> 33:11.066
I've actually been
meaning to call you.

33:11.133 --> 33:15.233
- Oh, Leo,
after the shooting and, uh...

33:15.300 --> 33:17.433
and after Diane left,
I admit that I went--

33:17.500 --> 33:18.934
I went south.

33:19.000 --> 33:21.767
I mean, singing at Officer
Howard's memorial service,

33:21.834 --> 33:24.033
that was just crazy.

33:24.100 --> 33:27.900
But I've had time to rest
and relax and think.

33:27.967 --> 33:29.266
- Tim...

33:29.333 --> 33:31.266
- I'm ready to come back.

33:31.333 --> 33:34.266
- Come back?
- To run Emerald City.

33:34.333 --> 33:37.166
- You can't.
The job's not available.

33:37.233 --> 33:38.633
- What?

33:38.700 --> 33:40.000
- I've hired someone
to replace you.

33:40.066 --> 33:41.867
- Well, unhire him.

33:41.934 --> 33:43.300
- No.

33:43.367 --> 33:46.066
- Leo, I took the heat for
that gun coming into Em City,

33:46.133 --> 33:49.233
but I read in the papers it
was actually Clayton Hughes,

33:49.300 --> 33:50.600
your little protégé,
that brought it in.

33:50.667 --> 33:52.433
- Yes, and he's been charged.

33:52.500 --> 33:54.567
He's out on bail until his trial
starts in a few weeks.

33:54.633 --> 33:56.166
- I want my unit back.

33:56.233 --> 33:57.834
- How many times you want
to hear me say no?

33:57.900 --> 34:00.767
- Leo, this is my life.

34:03.133 --> 34:05.200
- I'm well aware of that.

34:10.500 --> 34:13.867
I do have another offer.

34:13.934 --> 34:15.767
Holt's retiring.

34:15.834 --> 34:17.500
I need someone
to run Unit B.

34:20.433 --> 34:22.333
- I'll take it.

34:29.633 --> 34:31.033
- Well, well.

34:31.100 --> 34:33.166
Look who's here
to join the party.

34:45.266 --> 34:48.533
The arrest of Busmalis
and the Cardinal's visit

34:48.600 --> 34:50.533
can clearly help
the situation.

34:50.600 --> 34:52.834
- Our most recent poll shows
that 42% of the public

34:52.900 --> 34:55.233
now believe the prison
system is well run.

34:55.300 --> 34:59.633
That's up 16 points since
after the Em City shooting.

34:59.700 --> 35:01.100
- We're not getting
any backlash

35:01.166 --> 35:02.600
because of
Bellinger's execution?

35:02.667 --> 35:05.100
- A little.
But capturing Miguel Alvarez

35:05.166 --> 35:07.633
would balance it out.

35:07.700 --> 35:10.133
- Unfortunately,
there's still no sign of him.

35:10.200 --> 35:12.633
- Our biggest concern
right now is Clayton Hughes.

35:12.700 --> 35:14.433
He's out on bail
and he's been making

35:14.500 --> 35:16.300
a lot of speeches
condemning the Governor.

35:16.367 --> 35:17.867
- I know.

35:17.934 --> 35:20.767
- You have a relationship
with Hughes, don't you?

35:22.400 --> 35:24.700
- Clayton's father and I
were both rookies at Oz.

35:24.767 --> 35:29.033
His dad died in my arms, killed
by a prisoner back in 1982.

35:29.100 --> 35:30.767
- Well, we could use that.

35:32.266 --> 35:34.433
- You need to talk
to the man, Leo.

35:34.500 --> 35:36.600
Tell him to shut up.

35:37.533 --> 35:41.133
Time for me to charm
the D.A.

35:44.433 --> 35:46.233
- Desmond...

35:48.667 --> 35:51.200
Get me Clayton Hughes.

35:52.600 --> 35:54.867
- What I'm asking is for
you to cool the rhetoric.

35:54.934 --> 35:57.433
- Rhetoric?
I speak the truth.

35:57.500 --> 36:00.133
Devlin represents all that
is evil in white society,

36:00.200 --> 36:01.700
and honestly, I can't understand
how you could even think of

36:01.767 --> 36:03.867
running with him as
lieutenant governor.

36:03.934 --> 36:06.300
- Clayton, you lived a very
protected childhood.

36:06.367 --> 36:07.967
- Aw, here we go.

36:08.033 --> 36:10.166
You know, not everything
is tied to my father's death.

36:10.233 --> 36:11.700
- Yes, it is.

36:11.767 --> 36:13.767
You only see the world
as black and white.

36:13.834 --> 36:16.367
Trust me, Clayton,
life is gray,

36:16.433 --> 36:18.633
as gray as
these fucking walls.

36:18.700 --> 36:20.500
Now, I don't love
James Devlin,

36:20.567 --> 36:23.166
but I don't see him
as Satan either.

36:23.233 --> 36:26.867
- Somebody must stop him,
and soon.

36:33.834 --> 36:38.100
- It's what sets real leaders
apart from typical politicians.

36:38.166 --> 36:40.367
One man running
for governor has...

36:40.433 --> 36:43.300
- You Americans think just
because you have democracy,

36:43.367 --> 36:45.600
you're better than
everybody else.

36:45.667 --> 36:48.066
Elections are not what
makes a country great.

36:48.133 --> 36:49.700
- Yeah,
and what does?

36:49.767 --> 36:51.400
Vodka?

36:53.533 --> 36:55.066
How do you say it?

36:55.133 --> 36:58.467
To be ruthless.

36:58.533 --> 37:00.400
- Who's Ruth?
- Huh?

37:00.467 --> 37:02.600
- I don't know
anybody named Ruth.

37:03.867 --> 37:07.300
- Listen, Nikolai,
I been thinking.

37:07.367 --> 37:10.333
You and me, we can
make a lot of money

37:10.400 --> 37:12.600
renting that cell phone out
to the slugs around here.

37:12.667 --> 37:14.200
- We?
- Yeah.

37:14.266 --> 37:15.934
We're business
partners now, right?

37:16.000 --> 37:18.567
- No.
The phone is mine, O'Reilly.

37:18.633 --> 37:20.266
The more people
know about it,

37:20.333 --> 37:22.600
the sooner someone
blabs to the hacks.

37:22.667 --> 37:25.066
So just keep
your mouth shut tight.

37:28.834 --> 37:31.033
- Oh, God, I wish
I could find out

37:31.100 --> 37:33.433
where his fucking
hiding place is.

37:33.500 --> 37:34.967
Fuck.

37:35.033 --> 37:36.467
- Like a treasure hunt?

37:36.533 --> 37:38.467
- Yeah.

37:38.533 --> 37:41.667
Yeah, like a motherfucking
treasure hunt, Cyril.

37:41.734 --> 37:45.834
Listen, I want you to search
every square inch of Em City,

37:45.900 --> 37:47.734
see if you can find
that cell phone.

37:47.800 --> 37:50.800
But the trick is,
you can't let anyone know,

37:50.867 --> 37:53.767
especially Stanislofsky,
what you're doing.

37:53.834 --> 37:55.867
Okay?
- Okay, but can I start now?

37:55.934 --> 37:57.367
- Right now, go ahead.

38:17.333 --> 38:19.934
- I did just what you wanted.
I didn't say anything

38:20.000 --> 38:22.033
to anybody.
- Good boy.

38:22.100 --> 38:24.033
You didn't find the cell phone,
though, did you?

38:24.100 --> 38:26.133
- Nope.
- You, uh, looked all over?

38:26.200 --> 38:28.100
- Yup.
Where does he keep

38:28.166 --> 38:29.700
that fucking thing?

38:31.166 --> 38:32.333
Hi, how you doing?

38:32.400 --> 38:34.834
I'm gonna kill that
motherfucker.

38:34.900 --> 38:36.100
I'm gonna
fucking kill him.

38:37.633 --> 38:39.066
- Yes?

38:39.133 --> 38:41.667
- Dr. Nathan is here.

38:41.734 --> 38:43.633
- Send her in.

38:50.567 --> 38:52.567
Gloria.

38:54.066 --> 38:56.600
May I hug you?

38:56.667 --> 38:58.266
- Yeah.

39:00.633 --> 39:03.166
- Sit down, please.
- Thanks.

39:07.133 --> 39:11.000
Can I, uh, get you anything,
do anything?

39:12.934 --> 39:15.600
- Yeah, you can stop
being so goddamn nice.

39:17.066 --> 39:19.200
All right.

39:19.266 --> 39:21.500
- No, I didn't mean that.

39:21.567 --> 39:24.300
Leo, I know you know
what I'm going through,

39:24.367 --> 39:28.300
with your...daughter
getting raped.

39:28.367 --> 39:30.400
- Well, she's better now.

39:30.467 --> 39:32.667
In time,
you'll get better, too.

39:32.734 --> 39:34.667
- I want to come
back to work.

39:34.734 --> 39:36.300
- So soon?

39:36.367 --> 39:38.900
- If I don't come back now,
I never will.

39:38.967 --> 39:42.900
- Gloria, I don't
want you to quit,

39:42.967 --> 39:45.266
but I also don't want
you to rush yourself.

39:45.333 --> 39:49.867
Healing is a process,
a slow process.

39:49.934 --> 39:52.500
- Not for me.

39:52.567 --> 39:55.033
There's only one thing I need to
do to make myself feel better.

39:55.100 --> 39:56.333
- And what's that?

39:56.400 --> 39:59.066
- Confront Ryan O'Reilly.

40:02.533 --> 40:04.767
I know
you're responsible.

40:04.834 --> 40:07.300
- For what?

40:07.367 --> 40:09.867
- For me getting raped.

40:09.934 --> 40:11.066
- No way!

40:11.133 --> 40:12.600
- Don't you deny it.

40:12.667 --> 40:15.433
Don't you fucking deny it.
- Gloria.

40:15.500 --> 40:18.066
- I know, I know.

40:20.600 --> 40:23.800
You called somebody
and asked them for a favor.

40:24.767 --> 40:26.266
- Why would I do that?

40:26.333 --> 40:29.900
- Because the session the other
day didn't go your way.

40:29.967 --> 40:31.967
Because you
couldn't manipulate me.

40:32.033 --> 40:33.934
Because you're a twisted fuck.

40:35.934 --> 40:38.266
- You want me to say that
I called a pal of mine...

40:39.467 --> 40:42.133
and I had him beat you

40:42.200 --> 40:44.166
and rape you?

40:45.700 --> 40:47.633
Is that what you
want me to say?

40:47.700 --> 40:49.600
- Yes.

40:52.200 --> 40:54.600
- Fine.
I did.

40:56.633 --> 40:57.600
You happy?

40:59.867 --> 41:01.700
- Yes.

41:03.433 --> 41:05.467
The one thing
through all this shit

41:05.533 --> 41:09.533
you said over and over again
is that you love me,

41:09.600 --> 41:12.066
and all you wanted was
for me to say I love you back.

41:14.367 --> 41:16.400
Well, I came today
to tell you,

41:16.467 --> 41:19.200
to see your face
when I tell you

41:19.266 --> 41:21.934
that'll never, ever happen.

41:22.000 --> 41:24.600
In fact, it's the opposite.

41:24.667 --> 41:26.266
I hate you.

41:26.333 --> 41:30.934
I will always hate you until
we're both dead in the ground.

41:31.000 --> 41:33.300
I will hate you!

41:35.400 --> 41:36.467
- Fine.

41:38.734 --> 41:41.233
Then tell me something else.

41:41.300 --> 41:43.667
When he was fucking you,

41:43.734 --> 41:45.800
did you think of me?

41:48.567 --> 41:50.533
- Gloria!

41:50.600 --> 41:53.266
Gloria!
- Stop it, stop, back off!

41:53.333 --> 41:55.300
Back off!

41:55.367 --> 41:56.767
- Gloria!

41:59.100 --> 42:00.567
- Did you think
of me, huh?

42:00.633 --> 42:02.266
Did you fucking
think of me, huh?

42:02.333 --> 42:03.900
Did you
fucking think of me?

42:03.967 --> 42:05.667
Come on, Gloria!
Were you thinking of me?

42:05.734 --> 42:06.900
Huh? Huh?

42:10.800 --> 42:13.300
- Another work of mercy:
to comfort the afflicted.

42:13.367 --> 42:17.433
But you see, there are a lot
of ways to comfort somebody,

42:17.500 --> 42:20.367
and a lot of afflicted just
don't want to be comforted.

42:20.433 --> 42:23.000
- Gloria Nathan has decided to
press charges against you,

42:23.066 --> 42:25.800
so you might be looking
at another five years

42:25.867 --> 42:27.500
added onto your sentence.

42:27.567 --> 42:29.567
- Five years, gee.

42:29.633 --> 42:31.567
- And I have to
file a report.

42:31.633 --> 42:33.433
- Fine.

42:33.500 --> 42:36.867
- I know you
pretty well, Ryan.

42:36.934 --> 42:38.967
And it may seem crazy,
but I have to tell you

42:39.033 --> 42:42.000
that I think you're lying.

42:42.066 --> 42:45.266
I don't think you had anything
to do with Gloria's rape.

42:45.333 --> 42:46.900
- I said I did it.

42:46.967 --> 42:49.934
I did it, okay?

42:50.000 --> 42:52.467
- Okay.

42:52.533 --> 42:55.834
- When can we see Dr. Nathan
and those nice people again?

42:55.900 --> 42:58.266
- We're not,
It's over.

42:58.333 --> 42:59.967
- Oh.

43:00.033 --> 43:01.700
They still hate me?

43:01.767 --> 43:04.166
- No, Cyril,
they don't hate you.

43:04.233 --> 43:06.100
They hate me.

43:07.867 --> 43:11.500
Listen, um...that man
that you killed...

43:11.567 --> 43:13.767
- Dr. Nathan's husband?
- Yeah.

43:13.834 --> 43:15.800
- That wasn't your fault.

43:15.867 --> 43:17.200
Okay?

43:17.266 --> 43:19.367
- Okay.

43:21.934 --> 43:26.166
And, uh, Hamid Khan...

43:26.233 --> 43:28.367
that was my doing, too.

43:28.433 --> 43:30.166
All right?

43:30.233 --> 43:32.266
You gotta
know that, Cyril.

43:32.333 --> 43:36.200
I'm guilty, not you.

43:36.266 --> 43:38.700
Yeah.

43:38.767 --> 43:41.233
- I remember
when I was little

43:41.300 --> 43:45.433
that Mama used to
take us to confession,

43:45.500 --> 43:49.567
and we'd go in
the big wooden box

43:49.633 --> 43:53.133
and tell all our sins.
- Yeah.

43:53.200 --> 43:57.467
- And Mama said
by telling God,

43:57.533 --> 44:00.400
our sins were washed away.

44:00.467 --> 44:02.800
Remember?

44:04.800 --> 44:06.400
- Yeah.

44:06.467 --> 44:09.133
Yeah, I remember.

44:13.200 --> 44:15.767
Bless me, Father,
for I have sinned.

44:18.133 --> 44:19.834
Today I lied.

44:19.900 --> 44:25.500
I told someone I did
something that I didn't do.

44:25.567 --> 44:27.900
- Why?

44:27.967 --> 44:29.867
- Because it's what
she wanted to hear.

44:31.800 --> 44:33.533
Because it's what
she needs to know

44:33.600 --> 44:35.734
to make herself
whole again.

44:42.834 --> 44:45.834
- Fugitive Miguel Alvarez
continues to evade capture

44:45.900 --> 44:49.066
as police widen their
search across the state.

44:49.133 --> 44:50.867
Alvarez, along with
another prisoner,

44:50.934 --> 44:53.433
Agamemnon Busmalis,
escaped...

44:53.500 --> 44:55.300
- Look
who's out of the Hole.

44:55.367 --> 44:57.133
- Agamemnon
was recently captured

44:57.200 --> 45:00.233
and returned to Oswald
earlier this week.

45:00.300 --> 45:02.066
- How are ya?
What are you doin'?

45:02.133 --> 45:03.066
Anybody here
from Cleveland?

45:03.133 --> 45:05.433
All right.

45:05.500 --> 45:08.834
- Being free, even for a few
hours, was so wonderful.

45:08.900 --> 45:10.834
I mean, I had no money,
no overcoat,

45:10.900 --> 45:12.800
it was cold out there.

45:12.867 --> 45:15.300
But man, oh man,
I was so happy.

45:15.367 --> 45:17.333
I stopped in
the middle of the street

45:17.400 --> 45:18.400
and did a little dance.

45:18.467 --> 45:20.800
Whoo!
Whoo-ooh-ooh-whoo!

45:23.800 --> 45:25.900
Of course, that's when
they caught me.

45:25.967 --> 45:27.934
- You were standing outside
Miss Sally's house.

45:28.000 --> 45:30.367
- Yeah, I was hoping to catch
a glimpse of her in the flesh,

45:30.433 --> 45:32.567
maybe even exchange
a word or three.

45:32.633 --> 45:34.367
- What the fuck
happened to Alvarez?

45:34.433 --> 45:35.700
- I don't know.
Soon as we crawled

45:35.767 --> 45:37.333
out of the tunnel,
he vamoosed.

45:37.400 --> 45:40.900
- You know what I miss more than
anything about being free?

45:40.967 --> 45:42.033
Taking a bath.

45:42.100 --> 45:43.834
I hate showers.

45:43.900 --> 45:48.633
To sit and soak in a hot tub,
bubbles everywhere...

45:48.700 --> 45:50.066
- Bubbles.

45:52.567 --> 45:56.233
- I'll bet you even had a little
rubber ducky, huh, Nikolai?

45:56.300 --> 45:57.433
- Rubber ducky?

45:57.500 --> 45:58.500
- Yeah.

45:58.567 --> 46:00.400
- What is rubber ducky?

46:00.467 --> 46:02.967
- A product of capitalist
imperialism.

46:03.033 --> 46:05.333
- What do you miss most, Bob?

46:09.200 --> 46:12.000
- I have nothing
to say to you.

46:18.433 --> 46:20.900
- Bob, please, talk to me.

46:20.967 --> 46:23.400
This silence is grueling.

46:23.467 --> 46:25.100
Why are you mad at me?

46:25.200 --> 46:28.467
- The fact that you don't know
makes the offense worse.

46:28.533 --> 46:30.734
- You're pissed off
that I tried to escape?

46:30.800 --> 46:33.767
- I'm pissed off that you
didn't ask me to go with you.

46:33.834 --> 46:35.367
- Oh.

46:35.433 --> 46:38.033
- That you never ever told me
you were digging another tunnel.

46:38.100 --> 46:39.800
- Oh, well,
I had my reasons.

46:39.867 --> 46:41.100
- Which were?

46:41.166 --> 46:42.266
- Well...
- What?

46:42.333 --> 46:44.800
- I thought
you'd slow me down.

46:44.867 --> 46:46.333
- Slow you down?

46:46.400 --> 46:48.066
- I'm sorry, Bob.

46:48.133 --> 46:50.567
- I'm as vital as I ever was.
- I know.

46:50.633 --> 46:53.200
- I killed a man.
- I know!

46:53.266 --> 46:54.300
- Fuck you.

46:58.700 --> 47:01.066
- Oh, shit.

47:01.133 --> 47:03.533
- Tomorrow at dawn,
Shirley Bellinger

47:03.600 --> 47:05.166
will be executed
for the drowning

47:05.233 --> 47:06.700
of her eight-year-old daughter.

47:06.767 --> 47:08.834
State law allows Bellinger
the right to choose

47:08.900 --> 47:10.500
her own means of death.

47:10.567 --> 47:12.767
And Bellinger, the first woman
executed by the State

47:12.834 --> 47:16.333
since 1841,
has asked to be hanged.

47:16.400 --> 47:20.533
- Man, I can't listen to
this fucking shit anymore.

47:20.600 --> 47:22.700
- Yeah, depresses
the fuck out of me.

47:25.500 --> 47:28.667
- Adebisi, weren't you
in love with Bellinger?

47:28.734 --> 47:29.934
- No.

47:30.000 --> 47:32.133
- Yeah, you had
a little crush on her.

47:32.200 --> 47:33.633
- She had a crush on me.

47:33.700 --> 47:36.767
- If I had to die, I'd go
lethal injection, man.

47:36.834 --> 47:39.333
- Me, I'd D.D.

47:39.400 --> 47:41.934
An ounce or two of heroin,
straight up.

47:42.000 --> 47:43.200
Ha!

47:43.266 --> 47:45.600
- The State is not
going to give you drugs.

47:45.667 --> 47:48.066
- A-ain't lethal
injection a drug?

47:48.133 --> 47:49.867
- You know they get
a doctor to decide

47:49.934 --> 47:51.300
where the knot on
the noose should be,

47:51.367 --> 47:53.300
depending on the person's
height or weight,

47:53.367 --> 47:56.233
so that the noose snaps
the neck in the right place?

47:56.300 --> 48:00.166
- I remember the day of
my execution, I was terrified.

48:00.233 --> 48:04.767
But then when I didn't die,
I felt like such a coward.

48:07.100 --> 48:09.734
- Anti-capital punishment
protesters

48:09.800 --> 48:12.133
continue to march
outside the prison,

48:12.200 --> 48:13.700
though officials claim
the number

48:13.767 --> 48:15.467
is considerably smaller
than was expected.

48:15.533 --> 48:17.200
- Bye-bye Bellinger,
huh?

48:17.266 --> 48:18.967
- Yeah.

48:19.033 --> 48:21.100
I was kind of hoping
to see her one more time,

48:21.166 --> 48:23.000
but the hacks have delayed
all mail deliveries

48:23.066 --> 48:26.033
to death row till
after the execution.

48:26.100 --> 48:27.467
She was quite a gal.

48:27.533 --> 48:30.033
Reminds me of my late wife.

48:30.100 --> 48:32.433
My Arlene.

48:36.934 --> 48:39.100
- She showed me her cunt.

48:39.166 --> 48:42.100
I was mopping up the floor
outside her cell and wham, bam.

48:42.166 --> 48:44.300
Showed me her cunt.

48:47.700 --> 48:49.734
- Next item.

48:49.800 --> 48:52.467
Shirley Bellinger's execution is
scheduled for dawn tomorrow.

48:52.533 --> 48:53.867
- Bye.

48:53.934 --> 48:56.266
- Peter Marie...
- No, no, no, Leo.

48:56.333 --> 48:58.233
I agreed that I wouldn't
protest publicly again,

48:58.300 --> 48:59.934
but that doesn't mean
I have to sit here

49:00.000 --> 49:01.400
and listen to
the grim details.

49:01.467 --> 49:04.033
- But Bellinger has asked you
to do something for her.

49:04.100 --> 49:05.266
- What?

49:05.333 --> 49:07.400
- Well, after she's dead,
she wants you

49:07.467 --> 49:08.834
to collect her
personal possessions.

49:08.900 --> 49:11.200
She doesn't want anyone else
touching her things.

49:11.266 --> 49:12.900
- What am I supposed
to do with them?

49:12.967 --> 49:14.900
- Well, she says dispose
of them as you wish.

49:14.967 --> 49:17.667
- Okay, can I go now?

49:17.734 --> 49:20.600
Yeah.

49:22.133 --> 49:26.500
- Ray, she's asked for
you to pray with her.

49:26.567 --> 49:28.200
- Right.

49:30.967 --> 49:33.567
- Shirley, have you any
thoughts as the hour approaches?

49:33.633 --> 49:35.300
- Thoughts?

49:35.367 --> 49:37.734
Of course I have thoughts.
How could I not?

49:37.800 --> 49:39.800
- Would you share
them with us?

49:39.867 --> 49:42.066
- Sure.

49:42.133 --> 49:45.367
I'm wondering why anyone cares
what my thoughts are.

49:45.433 --> 49:47.400
Sure as hell didn't care
when my husband was drunk

49:47.467 --> 49:51.734
and beat me or when
my father-in-law raped me.

49:51.800 --> 49:53.800
No, it wasn't until
I killed my daughter,

49:53.867 --> 49:57.300
till I did something horrific
that what I think matters.

49:57.367 --> 50:01.667
All I wanted was for
someone to pay attention,

50:01.734 --> 50:03.100
and now that
you finally are,

50:03.166 --> 50:07.934
I see that my life then
or now isn't worth shit.

50:09.200 --> 50:13.633
Oh, if I say shit,
you can't use this, right?

50:13.700 --> 50:16.333
I'm not supposed to say
shit on the air, am I?

50:22.834 --> 50:24.033
- Aren't you curious to know

50:24.100 --> 50:26.567
who got Shirley
pregnant here in Oz?

50:28.867 --> 50:30.133
- No.

50:40.100 --> 50:41.700
It's time.

50:48.734 --> 50:50.533
- Good morning, sugar.

50:52.834 --> 50:54.133
- How you doing?

50:54.200 --> 50:56.433
- Woke up with
a crick in my neck.

50:56.500 --> 50:58.300
Must've been sleeping funny.

50:58.367 --> 51:00.033
- Maybe it's stress.

51:00.100 --> 51:03.600
- In any case, the hanging'll
take care of the crick.

51:03.667 --> 51:05.100
- What'd I--
what'd I miss?

51:05.166 --> 51:07.133
- Nothing yet, Natalie.

51:07.200 --> 51:09.166
- And Miles is sleeping?

51:09.233 --> 51:10.433
- Yeah.

51:10.500 --> 51:13.734
- The man has no sense
of propriety.

51:13.800 --> 51:15.500
So, uh...

51:15.567 --> 51:17.734
so what'd you have
for your final meal?

51:17.800 --> 51:19.834
- Nice Slimfast milkshake.

51:19.900 --> 51:22.000
Girl's got to
protect her figure,

51:22.066 --> 51:23.800
even if she's a corpse.

51:35.567 --> 51:36.734
- Ready?

51:38.200 --> 51:39.934
- Quite.

51:40.000 --> 51:42.133
Sorry to get you up
so early, Father.

51:44.667 --> 51:47.233
Warden, Officer Lopresti
has been coming to my cell

51:47.300 --> 51:48.900
every night and fucking me.

51:48.967 --> 51:50.333
- That's a lie!

51:50.400 --> 51:52.266
- You and I will talk later.

51:52.333 --> 51:53.667
- Yes, sir.

51:53.734 --> 51:54.900
Bitch.

51:54.967 --> 51:57.266
- Speaking of that,
Shirley,

51:57.333 --> 51:59.200
would you mind
solving a mystery for me?

51:59.266 --> 52:01.066
- If I can.

52:02.633 --> 52:04.767
- When you got pregnant
here in Oz,

52:04.834 --> 52:06.333
who was the father?

52:06.400 --> 52:08.600
Was it Lopresti?
- Oh, no.

52:08.667 --> 52:11.000
He wasn't working
death watch then.

52:11.066 --> 52:13.767
My lover was Satan
in the form of a man.

52:13.834 --> 52:15.233
- Which man?

52:15.300 --> 52:19.300
- A lady never reveals
such secrets.

52:19.367 --> 52:21.033
But I'll give you a hint.

52:22.633 --> 52:25.233
Neither rain nor snow...

52:33.834 --> 52:35.200
Good-bye, Moses.

52:35.266 --> 52:37.400
- So long, Shirley.

52:37.467 --> 52:40.033
- See you around, kiddo.

52:40.100 --> 52:42.100
Save me a seat
at the beauty salon.

52:44.400 --> 52:46.266
- The Lord is my shepherd...

52:46.333 --> 52:47.767
together: I shall not want.

52:47.834 --> 52:50.266
He makes me lie
down in green pastures.

52:50.333 --> 52:52.433
He leads me
beside still waters.

52:52.500 --> 52:53.900
He restores my soul.

53:01.633 --> 53:04.233
together: He guides me in
the paths of righteousness

53:04.300 --> 53:05.834
for his name's sake.

53:05.900 --> 53:07.433
Even though I walk
through the Valley

53:07.500 --> 53:09.000
of the shadow of death,

53:09.066 --> 53:10.467
I will fear no evil.

53:26.133 --> 53:27.633
both continue:
You prepare a table before me

53:27.700 --> 53:29.500
in the presence of mine enemies.

53:29.567 --> 53:31.433
You anoint my head with oil.

53:40.333 --> 53:43.734
- And I will dwell in
the house of the Lord forever.

53:43.800 --> 53:45.600
- Amen.

54:13.367 --> 54:15.300
-  No.
No, no.

54:15.367 --> 54:17.333
Uh, I changed my mind.

54:17.400 --> 54:18.800
I don't want to die
this way.

54:18.867 --> 54:20.166
I don't want to die.
- It's too late.

54:20.233 --> 54:22.100
- No, you--
- Shirley!

54:22.166 --> 54:23.967
- No, please, please!

54:24.033 --> 54:26.734
No, no, no, please!

54:26.800 --> 54:29.767
No!

54:29.834 --> 54:31.533
No, no, no, please, please!

54:31.600 --> 54:34.233
Oh, God, oh, God,
not yet, not yet!

54:34.300 --> 54:35.700
Not yet, not yet!

54:35.767 --> 54:37.000
Oh!

54:37.066 --> 54:38.867
Oh, sweet heaven.

54:38.934 --> 54:39.900
Oh, sweet Jesus.

54:39.967 --> 54:41.667
I'm sorry for all I've done.

54:41.734 --> 54:43.767
Please, please, please,
intercede for me now.

54:43.834 --> 54:45.734
Oh, sweet Jesus.

54:45.800 --> 54:48.800
Help me, sweet Jesus.
Help me, sweet Lord.

54:55.133 --> 54:56.433
I'm sorry for
all I've done.

54:56.500 --> 54:59.033
Please, please, please
intercede for me now.

54:59.100 --> 55:03.600
Oh, sweet Jesus.
Oh, help me, Mary, Jesus.

55:27.300 --> 55:29.066
- Hey, Sister.

55:29.133 --> 55:32.266
Can I have her mirror?

55:32.333 --> 55:34.000
- Sure.

55:38.233 --> 55:40.533
- I'm the next one to die,
you know.

55:40.600 --> 55:43.100
- Yes.

55:43.166 --> 55:45.133
I know.

55:51.000 --> 55:54.533
- The final act of mercy,
to bury the dead,

55:54.600 --> 55:57.367
to pray for the dead
and the living.

55:57.433 --> 55:59.567
We are merciful,

55:59.633 --> 56:01.834
not just for
humanitarian reasons.

56:01.900 --> 56:06.100
We are merciful because
we ourselves want to be saved.

56:06.166 --> 56:08.266
God expects mercy from us.

56:08.333 --> 56:10.300
God demands it.

56:10.367 --> 56:12.567
And how much mercy
does he show us?

56:14.233 --> 56:16.934
"Kyrie eleison"...

56:17.000 --> 56:20.967
That means Lord have mercy.

56:21.033 --> 56:23.400
Christ have mercy.

56:23.467 --> 56:25.433
Please.
