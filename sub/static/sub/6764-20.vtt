02:12.599 --> 02:15.466
How can Dylan stand living here
without a washing machine?

02:15.635 --> 02:17.899
I think he has a thing for the girl
at the Fluff 'N Fold.

02:19.739 --> 02:21.934
Man, if I knew you were doing
laundry in the bathroom,

02:22.108 --> 02:23.473
I'd have brought fabric softener.

02:23.910 --> 02:25.639
I guess you wanna
take a shower, huh?

02:25.812 --> 02:27.905
Whatever gave you
that impression, Kel?

02:28.081 --> 02:30.208
Is this a one-size-fits-all
kind of garment or what?

02:30.383 --> 02:32.078
Dylan.

02:32.252 --> 02:34.117
All right, I'll wait till you're done.

02:34.287 --> 02:36.448
But what do you think
the chances are of the three of us

02:36.623 --> 02:40.616
jumping into that shower
and conserving some serious water?

02:40.793 --> 02:43.023
I have a perfectly good room
back at the beach apartment.

02:43.196 --> 02:45.130
- Maybe I should...
- No, you shouldn't.

02:45.298 --> 02:48.028
Look, Kel, can't you give David
a break and just bury the hatchet?

02:48.201 --> 02:50.499
Is that what you think this is?
Some sort of family feud?

02:51.070 --> 02:53.334
Look, all I know is that if you
keep avoiding each other

02:53.506 --> 02:54.905
you're never gonna work this out.

02:55.074 --> 02:56.701
I'm not avoiding him.

02:56.876 --> 02:59.367
Donna, you just don't get it.
I care about him too.

02:59.546 --> 03:00.672
I wanna see him get better.

03:01.481 --> 03:03.415
He is better. I believe him.

03:04.384 --> 03:06.511
Then you're being a fool.

03:07.353 --> 03:11.346
Yeah, she's right, Donna.
David's just gonna have to tough it out.

03:11.524 --> 03:13.185
No one can convince him
he's got a problem.

03:13.359 --> 03:15.520
He's gonna have to come
to that realization himself.

03:15.962 --> 03:18.624
Well, then, how are we gonna
know when he's well?

03:20.033 --> 03:23.230
When he stops taking drugs
and starts taking responsibility.

03:29.075 --> 03:30.838
Listen, Dad, I don't know
what Kelly told you,

03:31.010 --> 03:32.739
but she completely overreacted.

03:32.912 --> 03:34.243
It's not like I'm an addict.

03:37.016 --> 03:38.847
What's it gonna take for you
to trust me again?

03:39.018 --> 03:41.953
You want me to move in so you can
give me a drug test every morning?

03:42.121 --> 03:43.486
I'm gonna talk to your therapist.

03:44.691 --> 03:46.522
And I'm gonna take
a good hard look for myself.

03:46.693 --> 03:50.129
And if I don't like
what I see by next week,

03:51.030 --> 03:53.999
I'm pulling you out of school
and you're going into rehab.

04:01.541 --> 04:03.600
So, what about the rent?

04:04.177 --> 04:05.804
I'll give you the money.

04:05.979 --> 04:08.675
But I'm making the check out
directly to your landlord.

04:10.116 --> 04:11.140
Thanks.

04:11.718 --> 04:12.742
How much is it?

04:12.919 --> 04:14.147
Six hundred and twenty.

04:15.288 --> 04:16.687
You live in the high-rent district.

04:18.124 --> 04:20.183
I live on the beach, what can I say?

04:21.127 --> 04:23.755
Just say you'll never do drugs again.

04:25.898 --> 04:27.160
It's a deal.

04:33.539 --> 04:35.029
Well, we set the date
for the wedding.

04:35.208 --> 04:36.402
Oh, that's great. When?

04:36.576 --> 04:37.600
Monday.

04:37.777 --> 04:40.439
Valentine's Day? That's so romantic.

04:40.613 --> 04:42.478
Wow, you guys aren't
wasting any time.

04:42.649 --> 04:45.174
Well, we can't afford to.

04:45.351 --> 04:47.876
So where's this shindig
gonna take place?

04:48.054 --> 04:50.887
We didn't want a big production,
so we're gonna go down to City Hall.

04:51.057 --> 04:53.753
Andrea, it's your wedding.
Throw a party, do something.

04:54.761 --> 04:59.198
Well, without my parents' blessing,
my heart's not in it.

04:59.365 --> 05:01.731
Well, it's not because
Jesse's Latino, is it?

05:01.901 --> 05:05.029
No, they think
I'm just throwing my life away.

05:05.571 --> 05:07.368
They don't want anything
to do with it.

05:07.940 --> 05:09.100
That's terrible.

05:09.509 --> 05:11.204
At least you have your grandmother.

05:11.377 --> 05:13.675
Yeah, well,
we're gonna tell her tonight.

05:13.846 --> 05:15.871
I'm not sure
she's gonna take it any better.

05:17.016 --> 05:18.677
Well, we're all happy for you.

05:19.285 --> 05:22.254
Thanks, Donna.
I'm glad somebody is.

05:22.989 --> 05:25.822
Here's the problem, you can't
stack boxes in front of the vent.

05:25.992 --> 05:29.553
- I told Suzanne.
- Well, tell her again.

05:29.729 --> 05:32.061
What are you doing here?

05:32.231 --> 05:34.131
Oh, you look great.

05:34.300 --> 05:36.632
- Hey.
- Hi, sweetheart, how are you?

05:37.537 --> 05:39.630
We didn't think we'd see you here
for another week.

05:40.106 --> 05:43.564
Well, I wouldn't be here at all
if it wasn't for my new partner.

05:43.743 --> 05:46.735
As new partner, does that mean I get
a discount on my megaburgers, Nat?

05:46.913 --> 05:48.073
No.

05:48.247 --> 05:50.340
I wanna renegotiate then.

05:51.117 --> 05:56.578
Hey, Brando, get over here.
We can't have a reunion without you.

05:56.756 --> 05:58.781
Nat, you look like a new man.
Welcome back.

05:58.958 --> 06:02.655
Thanks, it's because
I got a million-dollar ticker.

06:03.596 --> 06:05.996
And a million-dollar partner.

06:11.304 --> 06:13.670
So you're sure
I can't get you something?

06:13.840 --> 06:16.240
No, thank you, Grandma,
we're okay.

06:16.409 --> 06:17.899
Okay.

06:18.077 --> 06:21.444
You said you had
an important matter to discuss.

06:21.614 --> 06:27.712
It certainly looks important.
Two serious faces like that.

06:29.889 --> 06:31.686
Jesse's asked me to marry him.

06:31.858 --> 06:33.155
And what did you say?

06:33.760 --> 06:34.784
I said yes.

06:34.961 --> 06:36.895
Of course you did,
because you're pregnant.

06:40.400 --> 06:43.836
- Good guess, huh?
- Yeah.

06:44.504 --> 06:46.631
So how are Kenny and Gail
taking this news?

06:46.939 --> 06:48.839
Well, they're not exactly thrilled.

06:49.008 --> 06:50.635
Surprise, surprise.

06:52.044 --> 06:54.171
Grandma, we were...

06:54.347 --> 06:56.611
We were hoping
to get your blessing.

06:56.783 --> 06:59.581
I know you didn't approve
of Dad's marrying out of the faith.

06:59.752 --> 07:02.186
Approve? What's to approve?

07:03.689 --> 07:07.216
Has Andrea told you about what
happened to our family in Europe?

07:07.960 --> 07:09.552
About the Holocaust?

07:09.729 --> 07:11.196
Yes. Yes, she did.

07:12.231 --> 07:15.598
I know you're a very smart
young man,

07:15.768 --> 07:20.432
but, believe me,
from something like that, you learn.

07:21.474 --> 07:23.806
And the two things I learned
are these:

07:23.976 --> 07:27.309
First, people who ignore
the mistakes of the past

07:27.480 --> 07:29.209
are doomed to repeat them.

07:29.382 --> 07:30.781
Grandma, it's not a mistake.

07:30.950 --> 07:32.747
Let me finish.

07:33.486 --> 07:38.788
The second thing I learned
is that, in this life,

07:38.958 --> 07:41.688
you'd better take your blessings
where you find them.

07:43.129 --> 07:47.691
And I think you two
have found them.

07:53.673 --> 07:56.039
So where are we having
your wedding shower?

07:56.209 --> 07:57.801
I don't know,
I hadn't thought about it.

07:57.977 --> 07:59.911
Then we'll have it here.

08:00.580 --> 08:03.947
And as for your parents,
let me talk to them.

08:04.116 --> 08:07.517
Not that they ever listen
to what I have to say.

08:07.687 --> 08:11.054
I love you, Grandma. Thank you.

08:21.267 --> 08:23.098
Hey, Donna,
what are you doing here?

08:23.269 --> 08:25.567
Well, this is my apartment.

08:25.738 --> 08:27.433
Yeah, well, are you sure
you should be here?

08:27.607 --> 08:30.075
I mean, don't you need permission
from Kelly or something?

08:30.243 --> 08:32.107
Look, David,
she's just worried about you.

08:32.278 --> 08:34.143
So am I.
That's why we did what we did.

08:34.679 --> 08:35.977
Well, you guys can stop worrying.

08:36.148 --> 08:38.013
It was just a bad
couple of weeks, that's all.

08:38.918 --> 08:40.749
So you aren't doing
that stuff anymore?

08:41.187 --> 08:42.586
I'm trying.

08:42.755 --> 08:45.690
And I'm keeping it together
so far, really.

08:47.660 --> 08:49.059
Good.

08:49.862 --> 08:54.128
Well, I just came to get my dress for
the Valentine's Day dance tomorrow.

08:54.967 --> 08:57.367
- Do you wanna go?
- Well, what about Kelly?

08:57.537 --> 08:59.129
No, she already has a date.

08:59.639 --> 09:01.402
Very funny.

09:02.441 --> 09:04.341
So you'll come?

09:04.510 --> 09:05.534
Yeah, I'll be there.

09:06.245 --> 09:07.610
Great.

09:11.951 --> 09:14.078
Hey, Donna. How are you?

09:14.253 --> 09:16.118
I'm fine, Mr. Pitts.

09:16.289 --> 09:18.052
David tells me
you and Kelly were out of town.

09:18.224 --> 09:19.885
So how was your trip?

09:22.595 --> 09:24.119
It was fine, thanks.

09:24.297 --> 09:27.232
- Well, I'll see you later.
- Great.

09:30.403 --> 09:31.927
So, David...

09:32.104 --> 09:34.595
Don't worry, Mr. Pitts,
I have the rent.

09:34.774 --> 09:37.140
Well, great.
I knew you'd come through.

09:37.310 --> 09:38.834
I haven't rented to a deadbeat yet.

09:39.011 --> 09:42.139
Listen, my dad made it out
for the wrong amount.

09:42.315 --> 09:43.873
What should I do?

09:44.050 --> 09:45.142
It's your dad's check?

09:45.952 --> 09:47.146
Yeah.

09:48.421 --> 09:52.653
In that case, here's a hundred.

09:52.825 --> 09:58.195
Twenty, 40 and 50, we're even.

09:58.364 --> 10:00.628
- Great, thanks.
- No problem, kid.

10:09.008 --> 10:10.737
Well, listen to this,
tell me what you think.

10:11.344 --> 10:13.778
"Dear Stuart, in the last four weeks,

10:13.946 --> 10:15.971
I've discovered
what your promises are worth.

10:16.148 --> 10:17.843
I suppose you think
you can come back here,

10:18.017 --> 10:21.509
spend a lot of money on me, and
everything will be back the way it was.

10:21.687 --> 10:25.179
Well, think again, Stewie.
I am not for sale. "

10:25.358 --> 10:26.689
What do you think?

10:26.859 --> 10:29.419
- It's quite a Valentine.
- Well, he deserves it, doesn't he?

10:29.895 --> 10:32.022
I don't know, Bren.
Maybe the guy just got busy.

10:32.198 --> 10:35.463
I mean, he did say he was gonna be
taking over that big project

10:35.635 --> 10:37.159
down in Texas for his father.

10:37.603 --> 10:39.764
Brandon, does the old adage
"out of sight, out of mind"

10:39.939 --> 10:41.531
mean anything to you?

10:41.707 --> 10:44.301
I don't know, Bren.
First Dylan, and now Stuart.

10:44.477 --> 10:47.139
I think I'm seeing
a pattern forming here.

10:47.313 --> 10:49.247
Who's next for you,
the sultan of Brunei?

10:50.216 --> 10:52.081
This is about Dylan
buying the Pit, isn't it?

10:54.687 --> 10:57.053
You know, the Pit used to be
like home to me.

10:57.223 --> 11:00.386
And now every time I go in there,
I feel like a guest.

11:01.494 --> 11:04.361
Maybe it's time to find
someplace new to hang out.

11:04.530 --> 11:06.361
Like where?

11:06.532 --> 11:10.832
I don't know.
Someplace a little spicier.

11:20.846 --> 11:23.713
Brandon, are you making a habit
of dropping by?

11:24.183 --> 11:25.980
I hope so.

11:29.522 --> 11:31.217
Thanks.

11:31.891 --> 11:34.359
Well, the new place looks great.

11:34.527 --> 11:38.190
I see you already have
your masks prominently displayed.

11:38.998 --> 11:40.761
Friends usually call
before they come over.

11:41.600 --> 11:42.862
Why? You busy?

11:44.203 --> 11:46.763
Just preparing a lesson
on the origins of Valentine's Day.

11:48.340 --> 11:51.605
Well, you could practice it on me
if you want.

11:52.445 --> 11:54.276
You know, we tried this
when I was married,

11:54.447 --> 11:56.347
and you had about
a million other reasons

11:56.515 --> 11:58.380
why we were
totally unsuitable together.

11:58.551 --> 12:01.748
Well, what did I know?
I was just a kid then.

12:02.988 --> 12:04.512
Brandon, anything more
than a friendship

12:04.690 --> 12:07.056
might be too much for me
to handle right now.

12:09.495 --> 12:10.826
Well, what about the other night?

12:12.164 --> 12:13.222
That was the other night.

12:14.467 --> 12:17.300
Please, I'm just trying
to be rational for a change.

12:18.204 --> 12:21.970
Yeah, me too, but I can't stop
thinking about you, Lucinda.

12:23.109 --> 12:25.475
Oh, Brandon, don't say that.

12:25.644 --> 12:27.134
Why?

12:27.313 --> 12:29.781
Because you feel the same way?

12:31.283 --> 12:32.682
We can't do this.

12:32.852 --> 12:35.082
Then tell me you want me to leave.

12:51.570 --> 12:52.901
We're gonna be sorry.

12:54.173 --> 12:56.232
We'll get over it.

13:04.950 --> 13:08.386
Valentine's Day has its origin in
the Roman festival of the Lupercalia.

13:09.155 --> 13:11.885
Holy men in wolf masks
would ceremonially beat

13:12.057 --> 13:14.753
all the young virgins
with thongs of goat hide

13:14.927 --> 13:16.895
in order to purify them
and make them fertile.

13:17.429 --> 13:18.862
No wonder Rome fell.

13:19.799 --> 13:22.393
Donna, today our Valentine customs
aren't that much different.

13:22.568 --> 13:27.267
I mean, instead of goat hide,
men are bludgeoning women

13:27.439 --> 13:31.671
with perfume, flowers
and, of course, chocolate.

13:32.244 --> 13:34.712
Well, don't forget
the big bludgeon, jewelry.

13:34.880 --> 13:37.075
My ex-fiancé really knew
how to wield that diamond club.

13:37.249 --> 13:39.240
Well, we didn't hear you
complaining.

13:39.418 --> 13:40.476
I am now.

13:41.253 --> 13:43.653
Wasn't romance ever a component
of Valentine's Day?

13:43.823 --> 13:44.847
Historically, no.

13:45.024 --> 13:46.685
The goal of the day
was to mollify the fear

13:46.859 --> 13:48.349
that men had of women's sexuality.

13:48.527 --> 13:50.927
Let's see how this tracks
on our time line.

13:51.096 --> 13:53.587
You know, I think she has
a one-track mind.

13:53.766 --> 13:57.429
She does not.
She's a woman of principle.

13:57.603 --> 13:59.764
Yeah, she's the type of woman
who talks about principle,

13:59.972 --> 14:02.202
and then runs away
with your boyfriend.

14:02.374 --> 14:06.174
- Which happened to coincide with the
Roman fertility festival, the Lupercalia.

14:12.418 --> 14:14.352
- What's up, Happy Jack?
- It's the DJ man.

14:14.520 --> 14:15.885
How you doing, buddy?
Let's do this.

14:16.055 --> 14:18.421
Cool. You know, I really appreciate
this intro to the man.

14:18.591 --> 14:21.116
No problem, man, he's always
looking for good customers.

14:21.293 --> 14:23.090
But, listen,
I wanna warn you ahead of time.

14:23.262 --> 14:24.957
- These guys are into needles.
- Really?

14:25.130 --> 14:27.928
Yeah, but you can just say no.
I did, and they were pretty cool with it.

14:28.100 --> 14:29.590
Cool.

14:31.971 --> 14:35.600
Andy, it's me, Silver.
And I brought a friend.

14:36.675 --> 14:38.768
Come on in and beat the day.

14:40.045 --> 14:42.377
- Dude, you gotta hang out more.
- Thanks, brother.

14:42.548 --> 14:44.448
That's what I'm here for.

14:48.520 --> 14:49.544
You're home.

14:49.722 --> 14:51.656
Hi, honey. How was work?

14:51.824 --> 14:54.657
Well, I think I invented
a new tax loophole.

14:54.827 --> 14:57.523
Declare yourself a hostage
and deduct the ransom.

14:58.430 --> 15:00.295
Honey, I'm so proud of you.

15:01.200 --> 15:02.224
Only three?

15:02.401 --> 15:05.370
Yeah, Brandon's having dinner
with Andrea and Jesse.

15:05.537 --> 15:08.438
Has Brenda sent her
love letter to Stuart yet?

15:08.607 --> 15:10.541
Honey, we should really
tell her what's happening.

15:10.709 --> 15:11.937
Why?

15:12.111 --> 15:15.478
After what she put us through
with that stupid Vegas elopement,

15:15.648 --> 15:17.639
we deserve a little payback.

15:17.816 --> 15:19.477
- Hello.
- Hey.

15:19.652 --> 15:21.779
We're gonna be
eating shortly, honey.

15:21.954 --> 15:24.013
I'll be right back.
I just wanna hit the post office.

15:24.189 --> 15:25.679
The letter is finally done.

15:25.858 --> 15:28.622
I think it has just the right balance
of disdain and contempt.

15:28.794 --> 15:30.386
- Really?
- Yes.

15:30.562 --> 15:31.654
It now ends,

15:31.830 --> 15:33.821
"Stuart, your father was right.
You are a bum.

15:33.999 --> 15:35.864
Happy Valentine's Day. "

15:36.035 --> 15:37.696
- That should send a message.
- I think so.

15:37.870 --> 15:39.030
Honey, maybe you should...

15:39.204 --> 15:41.604
You know, Cindy, if she wants him
to get the letter by Monday,

15:41.774 --> 15:44.072
she should really get it
in the mail today.

15:44.243 --> 15:46.370
My thought exactly.

15:48.314 --> 15:50.179
Jim, this is mean.

15:50.349 --> 15:51.646
No, it's not.

15:51.817 --> 15:55.878
I think it's just the right balance
of disdain and contempt.

16:03.462 --> 16:05.123
Dig in.

16:05.297 --> 16:06.321
What is it?

16:06.498 --> 16:09.092
<i>Yeah, it's a Mexican specialty,
Mole poblano.</i>

16:09.268 --> 16:12.294
That's chicken
with spicy chocolate sauce.

16:12.471 --> 16:14.462
You really are pregnant, aren't you?

16:14.640 --> 16:15.971
Yeah.

16:16.608 --> 16:17.939
You know, Brandon,

16:18.110 --> 16:20.010
you're the closest thing
Andrea has to a brother.

16:20.179 --> 16:22.647
Well, I guess that makes you
my brother-in-law, doesn't it?

16:23.282 --> 16:25.341
Something like that, yeah.

16:25.517 --> 16:30.147
Well, that's why we wanted
to ask you a favor.

16:30.589 --> 16:31.613
Shoot.

16:32.524 --> 16:34.082
Brandon, would you give me away?

16:36.428 --> 16:38.794
Isn't that something
your father's supposed to do?

16:40.632 --> 16:42.998
Yeah, but it doesn't look like
it's gonna work out that way.

16:44.036 --> 16:45.560
I'm sorry.

16:47.906 --> 16:49.134
So will you do it?

16:50.442 --> 16:53.411
Yeah, absolutely.
Yes, I'd be honored.

16:53.579 --> 16:54.603
Of course I'll do it.

16:54.780 --> 16:56.179
- Thanks, man.
- You got it.

16:56.348 --> 16:57.906
Thank you.

16:59.184 --> 17:00.412
But there's one more thing.

17:00.586 --> 17:03.487
We're getting married at city hall,
but wanted to have a party afterwards.

17:03.655 --> 17:06.886
And you wanna have it at my house.
No problem, Cindy loves weddings.

17:07.059 --> 17:10.324
Well, not really.
Well, we didn't want anything fancy.

17:10.496 --> 17:12.726
And you know
your mom would go overboard.

17:12.897 --> 17:14.832
We were thinking at the Peach Pit.

17:15.434 --> 17:16.992
The Peach Pit
for a wedding reception?

17:17.669 --> 17:18.693
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

17:18.871 --> 17:20.031
Will you ask Nat for us?

17:21.640 --> 17:24.540
You know, that's really not
my department anymore.

17:24.710 --> 17:26.040
You should be talking to Dylan.

17:27.246 --> 17:30.181
Andrea, we're asking Brandon
to do too much already.

17:30.349 --> 17:31.680
- I'll talk to Dylan.
- Okay.

17:31.850 --> 17:34.318
You know what, guys,
I'll talk to Dylan for you.

17:34.987 --> 17:38.423
After all, I am
the father of the bride, right?

17:38.590 --> 17:40.182
Father-to-be with father of the bride.

17:40.359 --> 17:41.951
Eat, eat.

17:44.797 --> 17:49.325
David. Wait, you're supposed
to wear something with a heart.

17:49.501 --> 17:51.230
Well, I didn't have anything.

17:51.403 --> 17:54.201
No fear.
I stopped at the campus store.

17:57.643 --> 18:00.407
- Hey, how's it going?
- Hi.

18:00.579 --> 18:02.911
Donna, that's Jack.
He's coming to the party with us.

18:04.983 --> 18:08.510
- David, it's a Valentine's dance.
- So?

18:08.687 --> 18:13.090
So it's supposed to be romantic.
What's he doing here?

18:13.258 --> 18:16.694
Well, he just stopped by and he
doesn't have anything to do tonight.

18:16.862 --> 18:18.454
Besides, he's a really
talented musician.

18:18.630 --> 18:20.257
We're thinking of starting a band.

18:20.432 --> 18:21.558
He looks pretty out of it.

18:22.301 --> 18:24.895
Would you stop being so judgmental?
We're in college now.

18:25.070 --> 18:27.595
Not everyone we meet
is gonna be from Beverly Hills.

18:30.509 --> 18:33.706
- You got a cigarette?
- No.

18:33.879 --> 18:36.370
No worries. We can stop on the way.
You guys ready to go?

18:37.049 --> 18:38.516
- Yeah, let's get out of here.
- Cool.

18:38.684 --> 18:40.811
- Come on, Donna.
- Okay.

18:54.900 --> 18:57.425
Hey, hey, hey, what's this?
No heart costumes?

18:57.603 --> 19:00.163
- I wear my heart on my sleeve.
- No heart.

19:00.339 --> 19:03.900
Yeah, come on,
you nasty little fun tart, let's dance.

19:04.076 --> 19:07.375
That's my fun tart, all right?

19:07.546 --> 19:09.070
So you heard about
Andrea's wedding?

19:09.248 --> 19:10.772
Yeah, city hall, right?

19:10.949 --> 19:13.850
Yeah, and then she wants
to have the reception at the Peach Pit.

19:14.019 --> 19:15.350
Cool.

19:15.521 --> 19:18.012
Yeah, I think it'll be all right with Nat.
What do you think?

19:18.423 --> 19:20.482
How should I know?
You're his partner.

19:29.201 --> 19:31.226
Who is that growth
attached to David Silver?

19:31.637 --> 19:34.606
One of his new best friends,
probably.

19:34.773 --> 19:36.604
- Hi.
- Hi.

19:36.775 --> 19:38.675
- Hello.
- Oh, let me guess.

19:38.844 --> 19:40.675
You're the aorta
and you're the left ventricle.

19:41.313 --> 19:42.940
Steve Sanders, this is Jack Dornan.

19:43.415 --> 19:44.939
- How's it going?
- Howdy.

19:45.117 --> 19:48.018
Hey, either of you guys got a cigarette?
I left mine in the car.

19:48.187 --> 19:49.211
No.

19:49.388 --> 19:52.482
Well, it's like they say, if you don't use
your head, you gotta use your feet.

19:52.658 --> 19:54.023
Be right back.

19:56.495 --> 19:57.519
So where's the beer?

19:57.696 --> 20:00.324
Keg's on the second floor.
Come on, I'll show you.

20:00.499 --> 20:03.024
Oh, he's definitely clean and sober.

20:03.202 --> 20:05.693
- Kelly, he just went to get a beer.
- Right.

20:05.871 --> 20:07.998
Well, ladies, I'll see you later.
Have a good time.

20:08.173 --> 20:09.970
Hey, where are you going
with those cookies?

20:10.142 --> 20:11.973
None of your business.

20:13.245 --> 20:16.305
Does he have a girlfriend
we don't know about?

20:21.553 --> 20:22.577
Tasty.

20:22.754 --> 20:25.086
I had a feeling you'd like them.

20:25.257 --> 20:27.157
You didn't tell anyone
where you were going?

20:27.326 --> 20:29.886
- Of course not.
- Good.

20:30.062 --> 20:32.053
Because the last thing
either of us needs right now

20:32.231 --> 20:34.256
is a scandal in our lives.

20:34.433 --> 20:35.957
You've got the dean's task force

20:36.134 --> 20:40.002
and I've got my reputation
as an educator.

20:40.973 --> 20:42.873
I know, don't worry.

20:43.041 --> 20:45.737
We just have to take this day by day.

20:45.911 --> 20:47.310
Night by night.

20:48.680 --> 20:50.648
I guess that's all we've got.

20:52.050 --> 20:53.813
Unless...

20:53.986 --> 20:55.647
Unless what?

20:55.821 --> 20:56.913
I don't know.

20:57.089 --> 21:00.684
Maybe I'm dreaming, but I've got
this grant proposal in with the NEA

21:00.859 --> 21:02.417
to do a series of documentary films.

21:03.061 --> 21:07.361
And if it comes through,
I wouldn't have to teach anymore.

21:07.532 --> 21:10.023
I had no idea you were a filmmaker.

21:12.037 --> 21:14.699
There's a lot of things
you don't know about me, Brandon.

21:14.873 --> 21:16.807
I think I know enough to get by.

21:35.160 --> 21:39.426
Looks like Donna and David
are certainly making up for lost time.

21:40.098 --> 21:42.191
Yeah, maybe I have been
too rough on him.

21:42.367 --> 21:45.097
I mean, he has been
really sweet to her tonight.

21:46.405 --> 21:48.270
Yeah, maybe you ought
to just forget about it

21:48.440 --> 21:51.307
and focus on a more pressing issue.

21:51.476 --> 21:53.307
Like what?

21:54.012 --> 21:56.503
You're eighty-sixed, pal. Permanently.

21:56.682 --> 21:58.547
Hey, hey, hey,
what's going on here?

21:58.717 --> 22:00.981
This weasel was snorting up
in the rec room.

22:01.153 --> 22:03.246
- So, what are you, the DEA?
- No.

22:03.422 --> 22:06.084
I'm a member of this house who
doesn't wanna see his charter yanked.

22:06.258 --> 22:09.694
Come on, you guys have put away
enough beer tonight to float this place.

22:10.295 --> 22:12.354
Isn't that against
the university rules?

22:12.531 --> 22:14.431
Or is that okay,
some kind of jock thing?

22:15.167 --> 22:17.465
Dude, I'm out of here, man.

22:20.405 --> 22:22.396
Thanks for coming.

22:23.041 --> 22:24.235
Yeah.

22:28.213 --> 22:30.738
Come on, Donna.
Let's get out of here.

22:32.718 --> 22:35.084
What, are you gonna stay here
with these guys?

22:35.253 --> 22:36.720
You've been lying to me,
haven't you?

22:37.556 --> 22:38.682
What is this? An inquisition?

22:38.857 --> 22:40.722
You invited me to a party.
What's my crime?

22:41.827 --> 22:43.385
Just go.

22:44.796 --> 22:46.024
I'd be happy to.

22:54.973 --> 22:57.533
- Hey, David, where you going?
- Anywhere but here.

22:57.709 --> 23:00.200
So, what, you're just gonna
leave Donna hanging in there?

23:00.379 --> 23:02.279
Yeah, she'll be okay.

23:02.447 --> 23:04.472
You know, you're blowing it, man.

23:04.649 --> 23:07.049
Jeez, since when are you such
an expert on my life, Dylan?

23:07.219 --> 23:09.881
What, you think your life's
so complicated I can't figure it out?

23:10.055 --> 23:12.353
- Seen it before, you're a junkie.
- And you're a drunk.

23:12.524 --> 23:14.219
You're also
a sanctimonious pain in the ass.

23:14.393 --> 23:15.690
Why don't you just go back inside

23:15.861 --> 23:18.489
and tell Kelly you've done your little bit
for humanity, all right?

23:18.663 --> 23:20.096
She didn't tell me to come out here.

23:20.265 --> 23:22.460
Let me guess, you came out here
because you really care.

23:22.634 --> 23:23.692
Don't flatter yourself.

23:23.869 --> 23:25.928
I don't wanna owe anybody anything
and I owe you one.

23:26.104 --> 23:27.264
What are you talking about?

23:27.939 --> 23:30.703
You remember when my dad died
and you came to the Walsh house?

23:31.410 --> 23:32.434
No, not really.

23:32.611 --> 23:34.238
You said that though
we were never close,

23:34.413 --> 23:36.506
you could sort of understand
what I was going through,

23:36.681 --> 23:39.650
because of what happened
to you when Scott died.

23:39.818 --> 23:41.342
I was standing
on a ledge that day, man.

23:41.520 --> 23:43.454
My closest friends
were trying to help me.

23:43.622 --> 23:47.080
And for what it's worth,
you're the reason I didn't jump.

23:50.328 --> 23:52.353
Yeah, well, like I said,
I really don't remember.

23:53.565 --> 23:55.590
Remember what I'm telling you now.

23:55.767 --> 23:58.497
One of these days,
you'll be out there on that ledge.

23:58.670 --> 24:00.661
Before you jump, give me a call.

24:18.824 --> 24:20.849
What is this?

24:21.026 --> 24:23.119
It's a cross-cultural burrito.

24:23.295 --> 24:25.855
Grandma Rose supplied
the kasha varnishkas and the brisket,

24:26.031 --> 24:29.432
and Jesse's mom supplied
the tortilla and the guacamole.

24:29.601 --> 24:31.592
It is the most incredible thing
I've ever tasted.

24:31.770 --> 24:33.465
Thank you, darling.

24:33.638 --> 24:35.503
How come you're not eating?

24:35.674 --> 24:38.575
I can't, I'm too angry.

24:38.743 --> 24:40.074
Go on, say "I told you so. "

24:40.245 --> 24:42.475
Donna, you gotta stop
beating yourself up about this.

24:42.647 --> 24:45.047
Kelly, he was fine.
At least, I thought he was.

24:45.217 --> 24:49.051
And then all of a sudden,
he just wasn't David anymore.

24:50.522 --> 24:52.888
Well, it's good that you're angry.
It's about time.

24:55.727 --> 24:57.524
I'd do anything
to have the old David back.

24:58.797 --> 25:02.528
Come on, it's a wedding shower.
Try to find a little happiness.

25:03.869 --> 25:05.302
Come on,
she's opening the presents.

25:05.470 --> 25:06.767
Okay.

25:08.006 --> 25:09.564
Oh, this is from Brenda.

25:09.741 --> 25:11.675
- Oh, read the card.
- Okay.

25:14.079 --> 25:15.239
"What love is:

25:15.413 --> 25:18.314
If thou wouldst be taught,
thy heart must teach alone.

25:18.483 --> 25:21.975
Two souls with but a single thought,
two hearts that beat as one.

25:22.153 --> 25:23.814
But don't go by me,
I almost married a jerk

25:23.989 --> 25:27.015
who hasn't called me in a month.
Love, Brenda. "

25:27.759 --> 25:29.192
Yeah.

25:32.197 --> 25:35.132
Oh, look at that.

25:35.567 --> 25:37.933
Oh, I don't think my son
goes for that sort of thing.

25:38.103 --> 25:41.732
Oh, yeah, sure, Mom.
Who do you think you're kidding?

25:42.340 --> 25:43.637
Oh, I'll get it.

25:48.747 --> 25:51.511
Jesse, you're early.

25:51.683 --> 25:54.447
Go on, get out of here.
Take a walk, this is girl stuff.

25:54.619 --> 25:57.884
Okay, okay, I can take a hint.

25:58.557 --> 25:59.990
Did you talk to her parents?

26:00.158 --> 26:01.819
Yeah, no luck.

26:03.194 --> 26:06.186
Try again, Rose, please.
It really means a lot to her.

26:07.065 --> 26:09.226
I know. I will.

26:11.303 --> 26:13.066
- I wanna open the next one.
- Open that one.

26:13.238 --> 26:14.262
This is the big one.

26:23.014 --> 26:24.504
Steve?

26:27.586 --> 26:29.110
Steve?

26:29.287 --> 26:31.278
Steve, good morning.

26:31.856 --> 26:34.416
Did you have a few last night?

26:36.561 --> 26:40.122
Buddy, you would not believe
what I'm going through here.

26:40.298 --> 26:44.200
This place is like an
all-you-can-eat buffet for drinkers.

26:45.937 --> 26:48.804
- Are we supposed to play basketball?
- Yeah.

26:48.974 --> 26:52.569
Oh, Brandon, I gotta get out
of this place, it's like a saloon.

26:53.211 --> 26:58.274
Every day, everybody gets together
and plays this drinking game.

26:59.618 --> 27:01.415
Everybody sits around
watching my mother

27:01.586 --> 27:03.918
<i>in reruns of The Hartley House.</i>

27:04.089 --> 27:08.992
And every time my mother says,
"Chuckie," everybody drinks.

27:09.661 --> 27:13.290
You know how many times my mother
says "Chuckie" in a given episode?

27:13.465 --> 27:16.229
- Don't watch, Steve.
- That's not all.

27:16.401 --> 27:18.926
Remember I told you I was gonna
get John Sears' old room?

27:19.104 --> 27:20.537
Yeah.

27:21.072 --> 27:23.336
Well, I didn't count on
getting three roommates with it.

27:23.808 --> 27:27.869
Oh, so the prince
has to share his castle.

27:28.046 --> 27:30.674
I told you you were
gonna hate it here, bro.

27:30.849 --> 27:32.578
I gotta find someplace else to live.

27:33.885 --> 27:35.443
You got any ideas?

27:35.620 --> 27:39.249
You know,
as a matter of fact, maybe I do.

27:54.773 --> 27:56.263
Andy.

27:57.942 --> 27:59.807
Anybody there?

28:01.379 --> 28:02.846
It's me, David Silver.

28:09.621 --> 28:11.248
Hey.

28:13.091 --> 28:14.285
Did you see anybody out there?

28:14.459 --> 28:15.483
No, man.

28:15.660 --> 28:18.060
I was stopping by, got some
new CD's I want you to listen to.

28:18.229 --> 28:20.220
How about outside?
Did you see anybody outside?

28:20.398 --> 28:22.263
Yeah, there were
tons of people outside.

28:22.434 --> 28:23.924
I hope you like hip-hop.

28:24.102 --> 28:27.594
Yeah, some other time, huh?
Seems I gotta close the store.

28:29.174 --> 28:30.766
- Why? What's happening?
- Armageddon.

28:31.176 --> 28:33.610
I just got word the whole dorm
is gonna be busted.

28:33.778 --> 28:35.803
- Oh, God.
- Wait, you live off campus, right?

28:36.614 --> 28:39.208
- Yeah.
- Great.

28:39.718 --> 28:41.310
Take this to your house
and I'll call you

28:41.486 --> 28:43.477
as soon as everything's okay,
all right?

28:43.655 --> 28:45.452
- What's in it?
- What do you think is in it?

28:46.524 --> 28:47.718
I don't know about this, Andy.

28:47.892 --> 28:50.452
I don't know about that guy
that you brought over here yesterday.

28:50.628 --> 28:53.392
- Come on, Happy Jack is cool.
- Somebody dimed on me, man.

28:53.565 --> 28:55.294
You could be the one
who punked out.

28:55.467 --> 28:58.061
If I would've turned on you,
you think I would've come back here?

28:58.236 --> 29:01.137
All I know is I'm going down here,
and this stuff isn't even paid for yet.

29:01.306 --> 29:04.798
I'm about to get wiped both ways.
So you gotta help me out here, David.

29:04.976 --> 29:07.001
You're my only hope.

29:10.915 --> 29:13.008
There's no way Andrea's
gonna let me live in her room.

29:13.184 --> 29:15.982
Steve, she's moving in with Jesse.
She told me I could use her computer.

29:16.154 --> 29:18.179
Maybe you can sleep in her bed.

29:20.191 --> 29:23.558
- She's not home.
- I'm gonna leave her a note to call me.

29:24.429 --> 29:28.729
- Hey, Silver.
- Silver, how's it going?

29:28.900 --> 29:31.232
The Energizer Bunny's
got nothing on that kid.

29:31.402 --> 29:32.733
Completely unhinged.

29:35.907 --> 29:38.171
Bruner, you take the hallway.
Jennings, you come with me.

29:38.343 --> 29:39.867
- Let's go.
- All right.

29:40.945 --> 29:42.742
What's going on?

29:44.282 --> 29:46.079
Andrea, don't tear yourself up
over this.

29:46.251 --> 29:47.809
Grandma Rose
did the best she could.

29:47.986 --> 29:49.180
I know, but they're my parents.

29:49.354 --> 29:52.380
- I can't help but wish they were there.
- I know.

29:58.763 --> 29:59.923
What's going on here?

30:00.098 --> 30:01.156
It must be a fire drill.

30:01.332 --> 30:04.233
- Really?
- No, it's some kind of drug bust.

30:06.538 --> 30:08.233
Looks like I'm moving out
just in time.

30:08.406 --> 30:09.498
As a matter of fact, Andrea,

30:09.674 --> 30:11.539
I've been meaning
to talk to you about that.

30:11.709 --> 30:13.734
Man, this is serious.

30:49.948 --> 30:51.438
Hello?

30:54.686 --> 30:56.244
Calm down.

30:56.421 --> 30:59.015
Calm down.
Yeah, he's right here, hold on.

30:59.190 --> 31:01.158
Dylan, it's David.

31:03.228 --> 31:04.661
Yeah?

31:08.199 --> 31:09.826
Okay, man, just hold on.

31:10.001 --> 31:12.299
Don't do anything
until I get there, all right?

31:12.470 --> 31:14.062
Okay.

31:14.239 --> 31:15.831
Is he in trouble?

31:16.507 --> 31:18.168
Yeah.

31:31.556 --> 31:35.515
David. Open the door, it's me.

31:48.072 --> 31:50.506
So, what, you're smoking too?

31:50.675 --> 31:53.701
Man, I was so freaked out last night,
I went out and bought a pack.

31:53.878 --> 31:56.369
Was that before or after
you got strung out on meth?

31:57.015 --> 32:00.178
I haven't touched anything, man.
I didn't even sleep last night.

32:00.351 --> 32:01.375
I think I'm losing it.

32:01.552 --> 32:03.747
Just relax, David.

32:03.922 --> 32:05.014
So where is the stuff?

32:05.189 --> 32:06.349
It's in the bag.

32:06.524 --> 32:07.752
How much is in the bag?

32:07.926 --> 32:09.655
I don't know.
I was too afraid to open it.

32:14.499 --> 32:17.832
David, this is a lot of weight, man.
We gotta do something right now.

32:18.002 --> 32:20.562
I know, I was thinking maybe we could
go bury it out on the beach.

32:20.738 --> 32:21.864
Is that the best you can do?

32:22.040 --> 32:23.769
What if somebody's
watching your house?

32:23.942 --> 32:27.139
You think somebody's watching?
Great. Now, what am I gonna do?

32:27.312 --> 32:29.439
It's real simple.
Go in and flush it down the toilet.

32:29.614 --> 32:31.775
What, are you kidding?
I can't do that.

32:32.183 --> 32:33.343
Why can't you do that?

32:33.518 --> 32:35.383
Because, man,
that stuff's worth a lot of money.

32:35.553 --> 32:37.680
What about when Andy's out
and he comes looking for it?

32:37.855 --> 32:39.117
Tell Andy to kiss your ass.

32:39.290 --> 32:40.917
I can't do that, man. He's my friend.

32:41.092 --> 32:42.354
He's your friend?

32:42.527 --> 32:44.256
Let me tell you something
about your friend.

32:44.429 --> 32:45.896
When the cops
were hauling him away,

32:46.064 --> 32:48.464
before they even got him downtown,
they told him his best play

32:48.633 --> 32:50.157
was to give up his supplier.

32:50.335 --> 32:52.895
His lawyer shows up an hour later,
tells him the same thing.

32:53.071 --> 32:55.665
First offense, little cooperation,
he can skate.

32:55.840 --> 32:58.434
But guess whose name comes up
in the conversation around midnight.

32:59.510 --> 33:02.946
Yeah. So this morning,
the judge signs a search warrant.

33:03.114 --> 33:05.674
I'm guessing you got a 15-minute
time window to save your butt.

33:05.850 --> 33:08.011
Are you gonna stand here
and argue your options with me,

33:08.186 --> 33:11.155
or you gonna get in there
and flush that stuff down the toilet?

33:12.156 --> 33:15.250
Oh, man.
How'd I get myself into this?

33:15.426 --> 33:16.757
How'd you get into it?

33:16.928 --> 33:19.226
You get off on getting high, David.

33:19.397 --> 33:21.490
I mean, you don't wanna get rid
of this stuff, do you?

33:21.833 --> 33:24.233
That's why you're not flushing it
out of your life right now.

33:24.402 --> 33:26.836
I mean, why let all this
good blow go to waste, huh?

33:29.874 --> 33:32.138
You're on the ledge, Silver.

33:32.777 --> 33:33.801
Don't jump.

33:39.350 --> 33:41.250
All right, man. Go flush it.

33:41.419 --> 33:43.649
No, I'm not gonna flush it.

33:43.821 --> 33:45.721
You're gonna flush it.

33:46.391 --> 33:47.756
It's your deal.

34:46.650 --> 34:47.777
That's the last of it.

35:10.408 --> 35:13.036
There may just be hope
for you yet, Silver.

35:14.078 --> 35:15.272
Police. We have a warrant.

35:15.446 --> 35:17.243
Open up.

35:17.415 --> 35:19.110
- Oh, God.
- Be cool.

35:19.283 --> 35:22.150
Don't say anything,
just do what I do.

35:24.021 --> 35:25.750
Open up.

35:27.792 --> 35:31.489
Move, move, let's go. Up here,
against the wall, right now, move.

35:31.662 --> 35:34.324
- Move, move.
- Right here, move, relax now.

35:34.499 --> 35:37.024
You have the right to remain silent.
If you give up this right,

35:37.201 --> 35:39.863
anything you say can and will be used
against you in a court of law.

35:40.037 --> 35:41.527
You have the right to an attorney,

35:41.706 --> 35:43.503
to have the attorney
present during questioning.

35:43.674 --> 35:46.768
If you so desire and cannot afford one,
an attorney will be appointed for you

35:46.944 --> 35:48.502
without charge before questioning.

35:49.180 --> 35:51.478
- Get around back.
- I got it.

35:52.850 --> 35:53.976
- We got it.
- Clear, nothing.

35:54.152 --> 35:55.881
- There's no one else here, sir.
- All right.

35:56.053 --> 35:57.748
- Start in the living room.
- You got it.

35:57.922 --> 36:00.720
- Who's David Silver?
- I am.

36:00.892 --> 36:03.360
We have reason to believe
there's narcotics on the premises.

36:04.996 --> 36:07.055
Come on, son.
Your friend told us what you got here.

36:07.231 --> 36:08.994
You can hand it over
or we do it the hard way.

36:18.743 --> 36:20.608
Tear it apart, tear it apart.

36:34.659 --> 36:36.684
Oh, my God.

36:36.861 --> 36:39.056
The police did this?

36:39.230 --> 36:42.358
Yep, I've never been so scared
before in my life.

36:42.533 --> 36:46.333
It was a pretty thorough search,
but there wasn't anything here.

36:47.405 --> 36:50.533
You know, if it wasn't for Dylan,
I'd be in jail right now.

36:53.711 --> 36:55.372
Can't we sue them or something?

36:55.546 --> 36:59.073
No, they had a search warrant
and probable cause.

37:02.553 --> 37:06.887
Listen, I know
I've been a real mess lately

37:07.592 --> 37:11.255
and I wouldn't be surprised
if you guys didn't believe me,

37:11.996 --> 37:14.328
but I'm gonna stop doing drugs.

37:14.799 --> 37:16.824
I'm gonna get help
and I'm gonna stick with it.

37:18.836 --> 37:20.565
And you probably
won't believe this either,

37:20.738 --> 37:23.764
but I really am sorry
for everything I put you guys through.

37:24.675 --> 37:27.667
Admitting is the hardest part,
it's easy after that.

37:31.115 --> 37:32.309
No, it's not easy.

37:32.483 --> 37:37.614
It's never gonna be easy,
but it's gotta be better than this.

37:38.823 --> 37:41.849
- Well, I'll be there for you.
- Thanks.

37:44.762 --> 37:45.820
We all will.

37:46.597 --> 37:48.189
Thank you.

38:00.745 --> 38:02.235
Hey.

38:03.914 --> 38:07.475
The clock just struck February 14th.

38:07.652 --> 38:11.816
Would it be politically incorrect
to ask you to be my Valentine?

38:12.890 --> 38:14.687
Definitely.

38:16.761 --> 38:19.457
But I'll still let you stay
over here tonight.

38:21.132 --> 38:23.293
If you want to.

38:23.467 --> 38:25.526
A sleepover.

38:26.237 --> 38:28.467
I think I'll have to ask my mom.

38:28.639 --> 38:30.300
I'm serious.

38:30.941 --> 38:33.307
I'd like to see what
you're like first thing in the morning.

38:33.477 --> 38:36.571
Just scholarly curiosity, right?

38:36.747 --> 38:38.476
Exactly.

38:39.583 --> 38:43.417
Well, okay. I have to get up early.

38:43.587 --> 38:45.521
I'm giving away a bride.

38:45.690 --> 38:47.487
Who's the lucky girl?

38:47.658 --> 38:50.889
Andrea Zuckerman.
She's in your class.

38:51.062 --> 38:53.496
Oh, good for Andrea.

38:54.165 --> 38:56.156
She's definitely
not your average coed.

38:56.334 --> 38:59.735
Wait a minute.
You, in favor of marriage?

39:01.372 --> 39:05.433
Well, any ritual that's lasted
the test of time can't be all bad.

39:06.610 --> 39:07.804
Does she love him?

39:07.978 --> 39:09.206
Oh, yeah.

39:09.380 --> 39:11.507
Good, then she's got a chance.

39:14.719 --> 39:17.017
- You don't believe me?
- No, no, no.

39:17.188 --> 39:18.485
It's not that at all.

39:18.656 --> 39:22.922
I was just thinking
about one of my favorite rituals.

39:23.094 --> 39:24.527
And what's that?

39:25.396 --> 39:27.330
The encore.

39:41.379 --> 39:43.176
"Vasquez-Zuperman...

39:43.347 --> 39:45.713
Zuckerman. " You're next.

39:55.826 --> 39:56.986
Well, this is it, chief.

39:57.161 --> 39:59.891
- Yeah.
- Hey, that's Mrs. Chief to you.

40:09.407 --> 40:12.308
Wait. Not yet.

40:12.476 --> 40:14.808
Oh, my God.

40:14.979 --> 40:17.106
You look beautiful.

40:18.983 --> 40:20.382
Congratulations.

40:22.319 --> 40:24.844
You know we'd never miss
a wedding.

40:26.824 --> 40:27.848
You guys are great.

40:28.025 --> 40:29.492
Are we ready to begin?

40:29.660 --> 40:31.992
- Yeah. Yes, sir, we are.
- Very well, then.

40:35.199 --> 40:37.030
Excuse me, am I too late?

40:38.803 --> 40:39.827
Oh, my God.

40:42.039 --> 40:43.336
Oh, my...

40:44.809 --> 40:47.300
If you don't mind, I'd like
to give away my daughter.

40:50.080 --> 40:52.605
- Grandma.
- Don't look at me.

40:52.783 --> 40:55.980
I got a call last night from
that guy you're gonna marry.

40:56.153 --> 40:57.643
He's gonna make a hell of a lawyer.

40:58.856 --> 41:01.120
Thanks, Dad.

41:01.292 --> 41:04.625
So does this mean I'm out of a job?

41:04.795 --> 41:06.194
No way. Move over.

41:06.363 --> 41:07.591
Now you're the best man.

41:07.765 --> 41:09.494
Okay.

41:14.104 --> 41:16.038
I'm so happy.

41:49.573 --> 41:51.131
Kitchen towels.

41:51.842 --> 41:54.675
Either eat or dance.

41:54.845 --> 41:56.676
- Eat.
- Eat.

41:59.683 --> 42:02.208
Listen, Dylan,
I just wanna thank you again.

42:02.386 --> 42:04.684
You knew the cops were coming,
you came anyway.

42:04.855 --> 42:06.516
You saved my life.

42:06.690 --> 42:09.818
It's like I said, David, I owed you one.
We're even now.

42:11.295 --> 42:13.525
Well, it's Valentine's Day,
it's a wedding,

42:13.697 --> 42:15.562
and neither one of us have a date.

42:15.733 --> 42:18.133
What is wrong with this picture?

42:22.206 --> 42:23.605
It's too bad Stewie isn't here.

42:24.341 --> 42:27.970
No, it isn't.
I never wanna see that jerk again.

42:28.145 --> 42:30.545
Can you believe he didn't
even call me for Valentine's Day?

42:30.714 --> 42:32.238
- No.
- No card, no flowers.

42:32.416 --> 42:35.408
Not even some crummy candy.

42:35.986 --> 42:37.544
What is so funny, Brandon?

42:39.790 --> 42:40.814
Turn around, Bren.

42:43.928 --> 42:47.193
Stuart, oh, my God.
What are you doing here?

42:47.364 --> 42:49.924
Happy Valentine's Day, love.
The jerk is back.

42:50.100 --> 42:51.931
Where have you been?

42:53.504 --> 42:56.769
I had to leave for South America
to submit a bid on a project.

42:56.941 --> 42:59.705
I know it's a lame excuse
and I should have called.

42:59.877 --> 43:01.538
But when I spoke
to your father last week...

43:01.712 --> 43:04.510
- You talked to my father?
- Hi, Stuart.

43:06.083 --> 43:08.313
You knew he was coming
and you didn't tell me?

43:08.686 --> 43:10.415
What, and ruin your surprise?

43:11.722 --> 43:15.055
- Have fun, sweetheart.
- Thanks, Mom.

43:18.696 --> 43:21.358
Stuart, will you do something for me
and not ask why?

43:22.466 --> 43:23.490
Anything you want.

43:24.501 --> 43:27.493
When you get home,
if there's a letter from me,

43:27.671 --> 43:28.695
will you burn it?

43:29.940 --> 43:32.670
- Okay.
- Thanks.

43:35.579 --> 43:37.547
Let's take this thing up one notch.

43:37.715 --> 43:41.207
I have a special song
just for the occasion.

43:48.626 --> 43:51.094
Everybody, come on.
Get in a circle.

43:51.261 --> 43:53.058
Get in a circle.

44:15.886 --> 44:18.150
Is that perfect or what?

44:18.322 --> 44:19.914
Perfect.

00:00.500 --> 00:02.000
