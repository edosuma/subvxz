00:43.919 --> 00:45.712
Hey, take it easy will ya!

00:45.921 --> 00:47.380
Hey, who's the big birthday girl, huh?

00:47.589 --> 00:49.465
- Me!
- Oh boy, hey how old are you?

00:49.675 --> 00:50.758
I'm this!

00:50.968 --> 00:52.927
Well call me when you're this, okay.

00:53.137 --> 00:54.303
All right here we go now.

00:54.513 --> 00:56.180
You got it straight, okay?
Hold it there.

00:56.390 --> 00:59.100
Hey, beautiful, beautiful! Okay!

01:08.652 --> 01:11.487
Hey, what happened here?
What's the matter, huh?

01:11.697 --> 01:14.282
Johnny hit me. He don't like me anymore.

01:14.491 --> 01:17.577
Oh, I know what you're
goin' through, ya know.

01:17.786 --> 01:20.079
You gave him the best three
months of your life, huh?

01:20.289 --> 01:22.457
Then he left you for a pail and shovel.

01:23.083 --> 01:25.418
What do you see in him, anyway?
What are you in love with?

01:25.627 --> 01:30.673
He's not in your class. He's afraid
of the dark. He wets his pants.

01:31.133 --> 01:34.927
When he eats, he gets food all
over his face. He's a mama's boy.

01:35.137 --> 01:36.929
What are you, in nursery school now?

01:37.139 --> 01:39.348
I guarantee you, by the time
you get to kindergarten,

01:39.558 --> 01:41.934
you'll forget all about him, okay?

01:42.144 --> 01:45.730
Hey, look who's here!
Show time! Bobby Bunny, huh?

01:48.609 --> 01:51.986
Here we go, kids, let's go here.
Bobby Bunny's here...

01:52.196 --> 01:55.031
- What's that?
- Oh, nothing, nothing.

01:55.574 --> 01:58.969
Bobby Bunny just dropped
a few carrots, that's all.

05:18.318 --> 05:19.944
Well, let's go over today's schedule.

05:20.153 --> 05:23.197
It is exactly 6:33.

05:23.407 --> 05:26.242
It is exactly 6:34.

05:26.785 --> 05:28.327
At 7:00, we're meeting with the

05:28.537 --> 05:31.205
head of the furniture department
regarding inventory.

05:31.415 --> 05:34.375
Postpone the meeting.
Double-check the inventory,

05:34.584 --> 05:36.585
and fire the cleaning staff.

05:36.795 --> 05:39.088
7:20, you will crush the hopes
of the loading dock workers

05:39.298 --> 05:41.173
regarding better working conditions.

05:41.383 --> 05:43.175
Cancel the meeting,
and send out a memorandum

05:43.385 --> 05:45.678
that the working conditions
at the loading dock

05:45.887 --> 05:48.764
will remain as they have for
the past 35 years.

05:48.974 --> 05:50.099
Mm-hmm.

05:50.309 --> 05:52.184
At 7:30, we'll be meeting
with the accountants

05:52.394 --> 05:55.104
regarding donations and
charitable contributions.

05:55.314 --> 05:58.399
Cancel that meeting,
and cancel my check to Boy's Town.

05:59.443 --> 06:01.235
What time is Scrappleton coming?

06:01.445 --> 06:05.114
Uh, 7:50, with the legal
papers you requested.

06:05.949 --> 06:09.243
As soon as you finish with Scrappleton,
we leave for New Dorp, Staten Island

06:09.453 --> 06:11.996
to attend your granddaughter
Allison's wedding.

06:12.205 --> 06:15.249
Well, I hope she's made a better choice

06:15.459 --> 06:17.293
than her mother did!

06:17.961 --> 06:20.129
Jesus! Rose!

06:21.548 --> 06:23.716
How did you talk me into this?

06:25.510 --> 06:27.845
You should use Allison.
She's the one who has to wear it.

06:28.055 --> 06:31.349
It's unlucky for the bride to wear
her gown before the wedding day.

06:31.558 --> 06:33.434
How unlucky can she get,
look who she's marrying.

06:33.643 --> 06:35.353
Come on dear,
you shouldn't talk like that.

06:35.562 --> 06:37.855
Julio's a good boy.
Come on, Rose, will ya?

06:38.065 --> 06:40.941
See the guy for what he is.
He belongs to a gang.

06:41.151 --> 06:43.861
It's a good boy's gang.
They help people.

06:44.071 --> 06:47.907
- Ooh, take it easy, will ya?
- Oh, I'm sorry. Where'd I get you?

06:48.116 --> 06:50.534
If I show you where you got me
we'll never get outta here.

06:50.744 --> 06:52.495
All right, hold still.
I've gotta finish this.

06:52.704 --> 06:55.623
You gotta pick up the cake,
and mother will be here soon.

06:56.500 --> 06:58.376
Your mother.

06:59.169 --> 07:02.254
I gotta go to the john.
Monty! Oh, the dress!

07:02.464 --> 07:05.883
- No, you're wonderful.
- Allison, I need the phone.

07:06.093 --> 07:08.719
- I'm in here!
- Come on, get outta there!

07:09.262 --> 07:11.889
- Get off, will ya?
- I am so hung up on you.

07:12.099 --> 07:14.892
Good idea. I'll see you in church.

07:15.102 --> 07:15.851
Daddy!

07:16.061 --> 07:17.895
Don't worry, you won't
lose him, all right.

07:18.105 --> 07:19.730
Belinda, let's go.

07:20.607 --> 07:23.401
Someday I'll be out of your life.

07:23.610 --> 07:25.986
Yeah, right now get outta
the bathroom, all right.

07:42.003 --> 07:43.963
The best thing about having daughters.

07:59.563 --> 08:01.647
Nicky boy, it's Monty.

08:03.650 --> 08:05.109
Close the door.

08:07.612 --> 08:08.654
Yeah?

08:08.864 --> 08:10.865
Nicky, Rose's mother,
she's on her way over.

08:12.075 --> 08:13.868
So? What do you want from me?

08:14.077 --> 08:16.203
I need the truck.
I gotta pick up the wedding cake.

08:16.413 --> 08:17.997
What am I supposed to be, Allied Vans?

08:18.206 --> 08:19.999
You really know how to push
a friendship, you know?

08:20.208 --> 08:22.084
When's the last time
you did something for me?

08:22.294 --> 08:23.961
Hey Monty you got a
short memory, you know?

08:24.171 --> 08:25.504
Who drove all the way
down to Atlantic City

08:25.714 --> 08:27.339
to bail you out when you owed $400?

08:27.591 --> 08:29.467
At Belmont, you had
four losers in a row.

08:29.676 --> 08:30.843
Who gave you the winner in the fifth?

08:31.052 --> 08:32.970
The cake's for your godchild,
you ungrateful bastard you!

08:33.179 --> 08:36.056
All right, all right.
Give me a chance. I'm comin'.

08:47.110 --> 08:50.988
- Where's my stuff?
- By the front door. What's the rush?

08:51.198 --> 08:53.282
I gotta go to work.
I got a wedding to pay for.

08:53.492 --> 08:55.034
Don't forget the cake.

08:55.243 --> 08:58.824
How many years you know me?
Did I ever forget anything?

08:59.247 --> 09:01.624
Nicky, just in time. Beautiful!

09:01.833 --> 09:05.419
I don't wanna see her fucking... mother!

09:08.256 --> 09:11.717
- Was it Nicky?
- No, no. It's not Nicky. No.

09:13.261 --> 09:15.846
- Oh, it's mother!
- Leave him, dear.

09:16.056 --> 09:18.140
Just simply walk out on him.

09:18.350 --> 09:21.727
His entire body is bloodshot.
He'll never change.

09:22.270 --> 09:24.146
Nice to see you too.

09:24.356 --> 09:26.607
It's gonna be so much
fun having everyone here.

09:26.816 --> 09:28.692
Yeah, a lot of fun, a lot of fun.

09:28.902 --> 09:30.861
Well, if it isn't my favorite relative.

09:31.071 --> 09:33.072
Oh, don't start that bullshit, all right.

09:33.281 --> 09:35.866
Monty, please bring
mother's luggage upstairs.

09:36.910 --> 09:40.746
- Well what's Clive, a footstool?
- No, no, Monty, let me get this.

09:43.291 --> 09:47.169
- How can you stand him?
- You've gotta get to know him.

09:47.379 --> 09:49.630
The wedding is gonna be wonderful.

09:50.173 --> 09:51.966
We never get to see you.

09:52.175 --> 09:54.593
The store takes up all my time.

09:56.805 --> 09:58.806
Mother, why do you push
yourself so hard?

09:59.015 --> 10:00.558
The money doesn't matter.

10:00.767 --> 10:04.687
When your father was alive,
he ran Monahan's like a tyrant.

10:04.896 --> 10:06.689
He paid the help next to nothing.

10:06.898 --> 10:09.733
- He drove them like sled dogs.
- Wonderful man.

10:09.943 --> 10:14.113
Wonderful! Now that he's gone,
I carry on his work.

10:14.322 --> 10:15.739
Rose,

10:15.949 --> 10:20.744
I don't know how you can
live with that man.

10:20.954 --> 10:23.247
We're happy just the way we are.

10:23.456 --> 10:27.293
Happy? Yeah, we were
until a few minutes ago.

10:27.836 --> 10:30.212
And we don't want a dime from you.
You understand?

10:30.422 --> 10:31.755
No offense.

10:33.925 --> 10:35.342
No offense?

10:35.552 --> 10:37.136
No offense?

10:37.345 --> 10:39.722
You are an offense!

10:39.931 --> 10:42.725
Why, you can barely walk erect.

10:43.184 --> 10:46.353
You pollute the air with your smoking.

10:46.563 --> 10:48.731
You reek of liquor and
God knows what else.

10:48.940 --> 10:50.274
You're an ecological menace!

10:50.483 --> 10:52.693
Yeah, well you were the
inspiration for twin beds.

10:52.902 --> 10:54.486
And I'll tell you something else...

10:54.696 --> 10:56.196
Monty, don't start with mother.

10:56.406 --> 10:58.198
I'm not startin' nothin'.
It never ended.

10:58.408 --> 11:01.785
And to think of who you could
have married. Pat Flannigan.

11:01.995 --> 11:02.828
Do me a favor, will ya,

11:03.038 --> 11:05.289
don't start throwing up the
guys she could've married.

11:05.498 --> 11:06.999
He started out as a bricklayer.

11:07.208 --> 11:09.668
Now he owns his own
construction company.

11:09.878 --> 11:12.254
And what about Tom O'Rourke?
He started as a busboy.

11:12.464 --> 11:14.673
Today he has his own restaurant.

11:14.883 --> 11:18.761
Oh, yeah, I started out as a baby.
Today I'm a baby photographer.

11:18.970 --> 11:20.137
I'll see you later.

11:20.347 --> 11:23.307
And I'm sure you're gonna
talk about me when I'm gone.

11:35.028 --> 11:37.988
Where do you live, in Vermont?
What took you so long?

11:49.542 --> 11:51.543
Why do you let her mother get to you?

11:51.753 --> 11:53.796
Forget about her, will ya?

11:54.756 --> 11:57.049
She never wanted Rose
to marry me. Never.

12:00.178 --> 12:03.555
She says I drink too much,
I smoke too much, I gamble.

12:03.765 --> 12:05.641
She's right, but what am I gonna do?

12:05.850 --> 12:07.059
I can't control myself.

12:07.268 --> 12:10.354
I got no, uh, what's the word
I'm looking for, I got no...

12:10.563 --> 12:11.480
Class.

12:11.690 --> 12:14.108
Nah, we know I got class, no.

12:14.317 --> 12:15.901
It's a certain word I'm looking' for.

12:16.111 --> 12:18.529
What's the word for someone
who can't say "no"?

12:18.738 --> 12:21.073
- Sonya.
- Not Sonya. No, not Sonya.

12:21.324 --> 12:23.158
No, I got no...

12:24.160 --> 12:25.953
Willpower! That's the word
I'm lookin' for.

12:26.162 --> 12:28.122
Willpower, I got no willpower.
That's what it is.

12:28.331 --> 12:29.540
Yeah, willpower.

12:29.749 --> 12:32.084
Make a left on Elm. I got a quick shoot.

12:32.293 --> 12:34.086
What shoot? You didn't say
anything about a shoot.

12:34.295 --> 12:36.588
Leave me alone. I got enough
problems. Just take a left on Elm.

12:36.798 --> 12:39.091
I got a quick shoot. I'll be quick.
You can help me, all right.

12:39.300 --> 12:40.634
Oh, I can help you. Well, thanks.

12:40.844 --> 12:43.220
You really think I got no class?

12:43.430 --> 12:45.514
No, I don't think you got no class.

12:45.724 --> 12:49.518
I'm gonna be sad. Mmmmm.
Very good, okay!

12:49.728 --> 12:52.224
Now, I'm gonna be a monster.
Watch this, okay.

12:53.523 --> 12:55.399
Now the big one. Okay, the big one.

12:55.608 --> 12:57.151
Can you be happy?

12:57.360 --> 13:00.154
That's a good one! Okay, be happy.

13:00.363 --> 13:02.656
Okay, here we are. Smile pretty.

13:02.866 --> 13:04.950
Beautiful! There we go, we got it.

13:12.584 --> 13:14.126
The other door. The other door!

13:14.335 --> 13:16.128
- I got it, I got it.
- The other door!

13:27.390 --> 13:31.101
- Get outta here.
- Oooh! Oh!

13:36.649 --> 13:38.233
The cake, the cake!

13:43.656 --> 13:46.867
- Watch out for the top.
- I'm watching, I'm watching.

13:48.787 --> 13:50.370
It's not gonna slide
around in there, is it?

13:50.622 --> 13:52.456
No, I got it wedged against a toilet.

13:59.881 --> 14:02.549
This is just great.
My favorite system a lock.

14:02.759 --> 14:04.676
And I got Monty in the truck
with a wedding cake.

14:04.886 --> 14:06.762
I gotta pick up my mother,
take her to the beauty parlor.

14:07.013 --> 14:10.599
- What's the tip?
- Big Boy in the fifth.

14:11.434 --> 14:13.685
Forget it! The fifth goes off at 3:00.

14:13.895 --> 14:17.689
- We goin' to the track?
- I can't go. I got a bar to run.

14:17.899 --> 14:19.233
This here's a sure thing.

14:19.442 --> 14:22.236
- It's forty to one.
- Hey!

14:22.445 --> 14:25.614
- Wake up, we're closing up.
- I didn't finish my drink yet.

14:25.824 --> 14:29.243
You're finished now. Get outta here.
Here's your dollar.

14:33.456 --> 14:36.625
Come on, come on will ya.
We've got five minutes to post.

14:43.216 --> 14:45.092
Hey! Get the hell out of there!

14:45.301 --> 14:48.011
Slow down, will ya, slow down.
They're kids.

14:49.889 --> 14:51.682
Nicky, take care of it.

14:58.231 --> 15:00.090
What're you doing?

15:04.279 --> 15:06.822
Sixty seconds to post time.

15:09.117 --> 15:10.784
Are you gonna place a bet or what?

15:10.994 --> 15:15.414
Oh, yes, yes. I'd like the
number seven horse please.

15:15.623 --> 15:17.875
Thirty seconds to post time.

15:18.084 --> 15:23.380
I'd like to put two dollars to win,
and two dollars to place

15:23.590 --> 15:27.384
- and two dollars to show.
- Okay, buddy, good luck.

15:27.594 --> 15:32.389
The next time you bet,
remember, instead of saying

15:32.599 --> 15:34.516
two dollars to win,
two dollars to place,

15:34.726 --> 15:37.895
two dollars to show, just say,
"two across the board."

15:38.104 --> 15:41.106
- Gee, you mean instead of saying...
- What are you buyin', a house?

15:41.316 --> 15:42.399
Two dollars to place...

15:42.609 --> 15:44.902
Let's go while we're young.

15:45.111 --> 15:46.904
We're gonna get shut out!

15:47.113 --> 15:49.364
Yes, I have a friend
that wants to bet the

15:49.574 --> 15:50.991
number seven horse.

15:52.660 --> 15:55.078
Number six horse. Six horse.

15:55.288 --> 15:57.080
No more bets.

15:59.250 --> 16:01.335
And they're off!

16:04.505 --> 16:09.009
Nicky, come on. We're goin' to the rail.

16:10.053 --> 16:12.429
Big Boy making up lots
of ground on the outside,

16:12.639 --> 16:14.723
moving to the fourth spot.

16:14.933 --> 16:17.935
Here comes Big Boy with a rush
on the extreme outside.

16:18.978 --> 16:20.312
How's he doin'? How's he doin'?

16:20.521 --> 16:23.231
- Gettin' farther ahead all the time.
- Gimme those things.

16:25.443 --> 16:27.235
Five lengths ahead!

16:27.445 --> 16:29.363
Fifty bucks at forty to one!

16:29.572 --> 16:32.616
That's two grand apiece!
Two grand apiece!

16:35.328 --> 16:38.747
You dragged me out here,
you bastards, I love ya, I love ya!

16:48.424 --> 16:50.876
That's two grand apiece! Two G's!

16:54.597 --> 16:56.807
I'm goin' to Hawaii!
I'm goin' to Hawaii!

16:57.016 --> 16:59.935
- He's fallin' back.
- I'm not goin' to Hawaii!

17:02.981 --> 17:04.647
He's too far ahead to lose.

17:13.116 --> 17:15.367
Look at him!
He thinks he's water skiing!

17:17.744 --> 17:20.204
- We were in. What happened?
- Yeah, there's our winner.

17:20.748 --> 17:23.625
I closed my bar! Get outta here!

17:23.835 --> 17:26.627
I'll kill you.

17:26.838 --> 17:29.131
I'll kill you, Bosco!

17:29.340 --> 17:32.134
I'll kill him. I'll kill you!

17:32.343 --> 17:35.721
There was supposed to be a fix. Crooks!

17:36.014 --> 17:39.099
I was gonna buy a new neon sign.

17:43.646 --> 17:45.522
Yeah, that's it. Step on his face!

17:45.732 --> 17:47.882
That son of a bitch!

17:56.534 --> 17:59.494
Go get him, Nicky!

17:59.704 --> 18:02.581
My bridesmaids' dresses are lime green.

18:02.790 --> 18:06.084
And my maid of honor
is wearing lime green.

18:06.377 --> 18:08.754
The maid of honor's dress should
always be in contrast

18:08.963 --> 18:09.796
to the bridesmaids.

18:10.006 --> 18:14.176
This is, um, delicious!
What do you call it?

18:14.385 --> 18:15.302
Chicken!

18:15.511 --> 18:17.929
I know it's chicken, dear,
but what kind?

18:18.139 --> 18:19.306
There's Kiev, there's Florentine...

18:19.515 --> 18:21.808
Shake & bake!

18:22.018 --> 18:23.810
Mother, I'm glad you could come.

18:24.020 --> 18:26.813
I've always been sorry
you missed my wedding.

18:27.023 --> 18:28.607
You know I couldn't go to your wedding.

18:28.816 --> 18:29.816
That's cause Daddy was there.

18:30.026 --> 18:32.194
Where is your father tonight, dear?

18:32.403 --> 18:33.528
He's taking baby pictures.

18:33.738 --> 18:38.408
Ha! What kind of a baby is it
that's still up at 9 at night?

18:51.422 --> 18:52.839
Sweetheart, watch out for this guy.

18:53.049 --> 18:55.842
He'll buy you a bottle of beer,
and squeeze the "schlitz" outta ya.

18:56.052 --> 18:57.677
Who is this guy?

18:57.887 --> 19:00.347
He's my friend. Don't worry about him.

19:00.556 --> 19:04.351
Excuse me, miss. I don't mean
to interrupt while you're working.

19:04.560 --> 19:08.105
I was wondering if you could
come over to the house

19:08.314 --> 19:11.358
Sunday for dinner and meet my mother?

19:11.567 --> 19:13.860
- Do you wanna go home?
- He's kiddin' around.

19:14.070 --> 19:17.364
Excuse me, pal. You got a problem here?
This is my friend.

19:17.573 --> 19:19.908
- Who are you?
- Who am I?

19:20.118 --> 19:21.827
I'm the guy that put
the bathrooms in this joint.

19:22.036 --> 19:22.619
That's who I am.

19:22.829 --> 19:25.663
Now I know why the place
stinks, okay, pal?

19:27.708 --> 19:30.168
Break it up, will ya? What's the matter?

19:32.713 --> 19:34.673
Take it easy, will ya?

19:36.509 --> 19:38.969
- Ma?
- Hmm?

19:39.512 --> 19:41.388
Am I pretty?

19:41.597 --> 19:43.974
Oh, you're beautiful, sweetheart.

19:44.517 --> 19:46.393
Julio's a very lucky boy.

19:47.603 --> 19:49.896
I wanna make him happy.

19:50.106 --> 19:51.898
But there's so much I don't know.

19:52.108 --> 19:55.402
- Like what?
- Like about, you know.

19:55.611 --> 19:58.488
- I know what?
- You know!

20:00.032 --> 20:01.950
Oh, that.

20:02.160 --> 20:04.452
Didn't your father tell you
everything you need to know?

20:04.662 --> 20:07.956
He keeps starting,
but he never finishes.

20:08.166 --> 20:10.625
What do you wanna know?

20:11.919 --> 20:15.005
Foreplay. Have you
ever heard of foreplay?

20:15.256 --> 20:17.924
No, not with your father.

20:18.134 --> 20:20.927
It's nice we can have
these little talks.

20:21.137 --> 20:22.679
Let's go help Belinda pour the coffee.

20:22.889 --> 20:23.430
Wait, Mom.

20:23.639 --> 20:25.515
How did you know that
you really loved Daddy?

20:26.058 --> 20:29.519
We were at Coney Island
on the ferris wheel.

20:30.062 --> 20:31.938
We got caught at the top.

20:32.148 --> 20:34.024
Later on, I found out

20:34.567 --> 20:37.944
he paid the man a dollar
to stop the ride.

20:38.154 --> 20:40.447
Your father said things to me

20:40.656 --> 20:44.534
that were so sweet, so romantic.

20:45.077 --> 20:49.539
I said to myself,
"Here's a sensitive man."

20:49.832 --> 20:52.209
Just once, a fuckin' four!

20:52.418 --> 20:55.212
Four! Got a four!

20:55.421 --> 20:57.214
Gimme the dice, I'm hot. Gimme the dice.

20:57.423 --> 21:00.217
Hold it, hold it! You won, right?

21:00.426 --> 21:02.719
We're ahead.
We can leave winners right now.

21:02.929 --> 21:04.221
Okay, so we go. Let's go.

21:04.430 --> 21:07.224
Double or nothin'. Come on, here we go.

21:07.433 --> 21:10.310
Oh, Monty!

21:30.915 --> 21:32.791
You did it again, huh?

21:34.335 --> 21:36.836
We were winners.
We could've walked away.

21:37.964 --> 21:40.674
That's how I am.
Once I get goin', I can't stop.

21:50.393 --> 21:54.354
Come on. Forget about it.
It's history. Let's go.

21:59.902 --> 22:03.280
Good stuff. It oughta be.
I got it off a cop.

22:03.489 --> 22:07.450
- I'm starvin'.
- Let's go to Lucky's. He's open late.

22:21.882 --> 22:23.258
He's closed.

22:23.467 --> 22:26.386
Come on, Pop's inside. He'll let us in.

22:39.942 --> 22:41.818
Pop's last dish.

22:42.028 --> 22:43.778
We're drivin' a half hour.

22:43.988 --> 22:46.197
The closest we came to food,
we almost hit a deer.

22:46.407 --> 22:47.991
Hey, there's a place.

23:00.421 --> 23:03.048
I'm so hungry, I could eat the waitress.

23:18.481 --> 23:21.441
No, no! No! It's wrong.
Nicky, it's wrong.

23:21.650 --> 23:24.361
- I just wanna see what...
- It's wrong!

23:25.905 --> 23:28.865
It's wedding cake flavor.
I love wedding cake.

23:29.116 --> 23:30.784
Why don't you get married?

23:33.996 --> 23:35.997
Let me just lick the bride.

23:37.083 --> 23:38.875
That's my daughter!

23:39.085 --> 23:42.921
It's a little plastic thing.
It's not your daughter.

23:46.008 --> 23:48.885
Only one little flower each.

23:49.095 --> 23:51.888
There's a lot of little flowers.
Nobody will know the difference.

23:52.098 --> 23:54.391
Forget about it. Let's get outta here.

23:54.600 --> 23:56.976
And don't drive fast. You're drunk.

23:57.520 --> 23:59.979
Don't worry about it.
I drive better when I'm drunk.

24:05.027 --> 24:07.404
You got a weird sense of humor.
You know that?

24:07.613 --> 24:09.781
You laugh at everything.
Weather reports, car chase.

24:09.990 --> 24:11.449
You laugh at everything.

24:11.659 --> 24:13.952
Keep it straight, will ya?
You're swerving all over the place.

24:14.161 --> 24:16.830
I'm goin' straight.
I'm on the yellow line, I told ya.

24:17.039 --> 24:19.165
Move over to one side.
The other side! What are ya doin?

24:19.375 --> 24:21.543
You're on the other side! Get over here!

24:21.752 --> 24:23.670
- Keep to the right!
- Get your hands off the wheel!

24:23.879 --> 24:25.338
Nicky look out!

24:30.177 --> 24:32.912
My head! I hit my head!

24:34.265 --> 24:36.141
What's so funny?
Everything's funny to you.

24:36.350 --> 24:37.058
You laugh and laugh.

24:37.268 --> 24:39.561
Watch the road, will ya?
Will you watch the road?

24:39.770 --> 24:44.607
I lost my joint. Where's my joint?

24:44.817 --> 24:47.418
Just watch the road, asshole.

24:49.405 --> 24:51.197
Move the car, Nicky, the car!

25:13.921 --> 25:15.805
You got some aspirin?

25:37.369 --> 25:39.829
I'm sorry. It was an emergency.

26:08.067 --> 26:10.944
- You sure this is a good idea?
- Daddy.

26:11.153 --> 26:13.446
Isn't she beautiful?

26:13.656 --> 26:17.033
Yeah, but who's that with her?

26:19.912 --> 26:22.330
What do you see in this guy?

26:22.540 --> 26:25.291
He has everything I ever wanted.

26:25.501 --> 26:27.252
You don't ask for much, do you?

26:28.128 --> 26:30.296
Did your mother tell you
everything you need to know?

26:30.506 --> 26:31.965
She taught me how to fry bananas.

26:32.174 --> 26:33.049
Oh, beautiful!

26:33.259 --> 26:36.386
You'll end up working
in a Spanish restaurant.

26:45.980 --> 26:47.355
You're not pregnant, are you?

26:47.565 --> 26:50.066
Daddy! The way you brought me up?

26:50.276 --> 26:51.859
All right.

27:06.584 --> 27:10.044
Welcome, Allison. Welcome, Julio.

27:17.845 --> 27:21.306
Julio Vidal O'Campo,
will you have Allison

27:22.725 --> 27:26.060
Juliana Capuletti, to be your wife,

27:27.229 --> 27:28.813
to live together in the
covenant of marriage?

27:29.023 --> 27:30.648
Shhh!

27:30.858 --> 27:34.277
Will you love her, comfort her,
honor her and keep her

27:34.486 --> 27:36.779
in sickness and in health,

27:36.989 --> 27:39.532
and foresaking all others,
be faithful to her

27:39.742 --> 27:41.284
for as long as you both shall live?

27:41.493 --> 27:42.827
I do.

27:43.370 --> 27:47.248
Where's your father?
He's directing traffic.

27:47.458 --> 27:51.252
Please, let's go. Get outta here.
Come on, towards me.

27:51.462 --> 27:56.758
Back up, back up!
Turn the wheel to the right. The wheel!

27:56.967 --> 27:58.676
Where're you goin',
what's happening here?

27:58.886 --> 27:59.761
We gotta get outta here.

27:59.970 --> 28:03.348
Hold it, will ya, he ain't goin' nowhere.
What's your problem?

28:15.319 --> 28:17.153
Hey!

28:17.363 --> 28:19.155
Whoo!

28:19.406 --> 28:20.615
Hey!

28:24.328 --> 28:25.662
Whoo!

28:32.252 --> 28:35.213
Why didn't he fix the walk?
It's been this way for months!

29:10.582 --> 29:13.459
Why can't you make everybody happy
and shake hands with this kid?

29:13.669 --> 29:15.461
- Not me.
- Shake hands with him.

29:15.671 --> 29:17.547
Go ahead.

29:20.092 --> 29:21.217
Look at him, look at him.

29:21.427 --> 29:23.553
If I look at him, I won't shake hands!

29:23.846 --> 29:26.013
Look at him. Go ahead.

29:28.350 --> 29:30.727
Now look, Julio.
We're family now, all right?

29:30.936 --> 29:33.730
Just do the right thing.
Make Allison happy.

29:33.939 --> 29:35.690
She's a great girl.

29:35.899 --> 29:39.318
I know, I lived with her for 18 years.

29:39.862 --> 29:42.363
Can I call you dad?

29:44.992 --> 29:48.828
Oh, it's wonderful to
see you two get along.

29:57.087 --> 29:59.213
Good-bye, honey!

30:09.933 --> 30:12.351
Hey, what are we doin' here,
my glass is empty.

30:12.561 --> 30:14.228
Come on, will ya?

30:33.332 --> 30:34.749
Wow.

30:35.876 --> 30:37.668
This is it.

30:37.878 --> 30:41.005
Yeah, our first motel room.

31:13.330 --> 31:16.690
Okay, let's get the guy up here
who paid for this shindig.

31:27.344 --> 31:29.804
Hold it, hold it. Let him talk.

31:30.347 --> 31:33.224
- I got nothin' to say, Nicky.
- Then sing a song. I sang.

31:33.433 --> 31:36.810
- I can't sing. Are you kiddin'?
- Sing "La Consonetta."

31:38.856 --> 31:41.861
I'm no Sinatra, but here it goes. Okay?

31:47.865 --> 31:51.826
<i>Some think the world was
made for fun and frolic</i>

31:52.369 --> 31:55.413
<i>And so do I and so do I</i>

31:55.873 --> 31:59.834
<i>Some think it's right
to be so melancholic</i>

32:00.377 --> 32:03.337
<i>They'll pine and sigh
they'll pine and sigh</i>

32:03.881 --> 32:07.884
<i>But I, I like to spend
my time a-singing</i>

32:08.093 --> 32:11.470
<i>Some joyous song some joyous song</i>

32:12.014 --> 32:15.892
<i>To set the air with music ever ringing</i>

32:16.101 --> 32:19.896
<i>Is far from wrong is far from wrong</i>

32:20.105 --> 32:23.482
<i>Hark it, hark it music from afar</i>

32:24.026 --> 32:26.611
<i>Hark it, hark it with a happy heart</i>

32:27.029 --> 32:31.449
<i>Funiculi, funicula funiculi, funicula</i>

32:31.658 --> 32:34.827
<i>Joy is everywhere funiculi, funicula</i>

32:35.037 --> 32:38.497
<i>Hark it, hark it music from afar</i>

32:38.999 --> 32:41.792
<i>Hark it, hark it with a happy heart</i>

32:42.002 --> 32:46.923
<i>Funiculi, funicula funiculi, funicula</i>

32:47.132 --> 32:50.343
<i>Joy is everywhere funiculi, funicula</i>

32:50.552 --> 32:53.930
<i>Hark it, hark it music from afar</i>

32:54.139 --> 32:57.350
<i>Hark it, hark it with a happy heart</i>

32:57.559 --> 33:01.938
<i>Funiculi, funicula funiculi, funicula</i>

33:02.147 --> 33:09.028
<i>Joy is everywhere funiculi, funicula</i>

34:07.129 --> 34:08.754
How do I look?

34:12.134 --> 34:13.842
You look beautiful.

34:36.658 --> 34:39.659
I always dreamed about my wedding day.

34:41.288 --> 34:43.621
I guess I never thought about the night.

35:07.189 --> 35:09.023
Be gentle with me.

35:20.702 --> 35:22.620
Julio!

35:22.829 --> 35:25.122
This is foreplay.

35:25.332 --> 35:29.585
- I have a headache.
- I don't wanna touch your head.

35:29.795 --> 35:32.588
Please, Julio, I've never
been with a man before.

35:32.798 --> 35:34.590
Neither have I!

35:34.800 --> 35:36.258
Julio!

35:41.223 --> 35:44.475
- What's wrong with you?
- I don't know what to do.

35:45.727 --> 35:49.105
- I brought a book.
- A book?

35:55.237 --> 35:57.113
"El Joyo de Sexo."

35:57.322 --> 36:00.157
- It's in Spanish.
- I'm gonna translate it for you.

36:00.367 --> 36:03.702
It has a very happy ending.
You're gonna love it.

36:13.213 --> 36:15.172
Allison?

36:15.757 --> 36:18.092
What do you want from me, Julio?

36:18.844 --> 36:21.428
I never seen anything like that.

36:22.848 --> 36:25.141
Try to understand.

36:25.350 --> 36:28.144
I keep hearing my father say, "Don't."

36:28.353 --> 36:31.188
He meant before you were married.

36:34.776 --> 36:38.737
I'm not so sure.
You don't know my father.

36:42.284 --> 36:44.243
Allison,

36:46.288 --> 36:47.997
listen to me.

36:50.750 --> 36:54.128
My cousin once knew a guy,

36:55.380 --> 36:59.175
and the guy went out with a virgin

36:59.384 --> 37:01.385
for six months.

37:02.888 --> 37:07.683
And on their wedding night,
when they got married,

37:07.893 --> 37:11.270
and they wanted to consummate
the marriage,

37:12.814 --> 37:15.024
the woman wouldn't let him.

37:17.819 --> 37:20.696
And in the morning,

37:20.906 --> 37:23.240
they found the guy dead

37:24.826 --> 37:27.786
in the bed next to her.

37:30.332 --> 37:33.250
- Oh.
- Allison?

37:35.420 --> 37:37.630
I don't wanna die.

37:41.843 --> 37:45.221
- You're my wife.
- Yeah.

37:45.430 --> 37:48.807
- I love you.
- Yeah.

37:49.351 --> 37:51.268
We're all alone.

37:52.938 --> 37:55.231
And your father,

37:55.440 --> 37:58.016
he is a million miles away.

38:04.866 --> 38:06.784
Hello?

38:06.993 --> 38:12.248
Julio, I just wanna say
good night to my little baby.

38:12.457 --> 38:14.291
My father!

38:18.380 --> 38:22.258
You hung up on my father?
I wouldn't hang up on your father.

38:22.467 --> 38:24.677
You wouldn't understand my father.

38:24.886 --> 38:28.264
Yeah, well, I'm not so sure
I understand you either.

38:28.473 --> 38:32.351
Well then why don't you go spend your
wedding night with your father then?

38:35.397 --> 38:37.856
Okay, I will!

38:48.285 --> 38:50.744
Monty, don't forget to fix the walk.

38:50.954 --> 38:51.996
Yeah.

39:07.929 --> 39:10.097
Watch it, watch it!
Watch where you're goin'!

39:11.933 --> 39:13.851
My air mail!

39:14.060 --> 39:15.644
Oh, my air mail!

39:28.408 --> 39:30.868
Listen to me. I want my wife back.

39:31.244 --> 39:32.870
Well, look who's here. Don Juan.

39:33.079 --> 39:36.332
- It's your fault she left me, man.
- What, am I responsible?

39:36.541 --> 39:39.293
When Eddie Fisher broke up with Debbie,
you blame me for that too, huh?

39:39.502 --> 39:40.627
She don't wanna see ya.

39:40.837 --> 39:42.880
You gotta help me, man.
You gotta help me.

39:43.089 --> 39:46.383
Give her time.
She'll come back when she's ready.

39:46.593 --> 39:48.969
You oughta give her a few drinks.

39:49.179 --> 39:51.096
That's how I got her mother ready.

39:59.689 --> 40:00.773
I'm in.

40:01.900 --> 40:03.859
- It's up to you, Paddy.
- Yeah.

40:04.861 --> 40:08.364
- What the hell is that you got on?
- This? This used to be a shirt.

40:08.573 --> 40:10.407
You know Rose.
She don't throw nothin' out.

40:10.617 --> 40:11.909
She keeps lookin' at the cuffs.

40:12.118 --> 40:14.411
Soon as they get frayed,
it becomes a short-sleeve shirt.

40:14.621 --> 40:16.914
When the collar goes,
I end up with a pajama top.

40:17.082 --> 40:19.875
Right now I got 23
short-sleeve pajama tops.

40:20.085 --> 40:23.379
You know what I found in the closet?
A hundred 1978 calendars.

40:23.588 --> 40:25.381
That's Rose!

40:25.590 --> 40:28.425
I tell ya, if 1978 ever comes back,
we're in great shape, ya know.

40:28.635 --> 40:30.928
Hey, are we gonna talk
or we gonna play cards?

40:34.265 --> 40:35.641
He'll talk.

40:39.020 --> 40:41.897
Nicky, take it easy.

40:42.107 --> 40:44.983
Take it easy, Nicky. He didn't mean it.

40:48.071 --> 40:50.197
Monty, the phone.

40:51.658 --> 40:53.492
Hello? Hello?

40:54.536 --> 40:56.995
Monty, you have to pick it up.

41:05.004 --> 41:07.881
You got the wrong number.
There's nobody home. We're asleep.

41:08.633 --> 41:11.009
Mr. Capuletti?

41:12.554 --> 41:16.014
- Are you there?
- Monty, who is it, Monty?

41:23.815 --> 41:27.609
Hello, hello! Anyone there?

41:33.825 --> 41:36.243
Who know a Scrappleton?

41:36.453 --> 41:38.787
That's mother's lawyer.

41:44.294 --> 41:47.212
Yeah. Yeah?

41:47.422 --> 41:49.882
That's awful!

41:50.842 --> 41:54.720
No, no. I'm sorry. I'll tell her.

41:54.929 --> 41:56.805
I'll tell her. I'm sorry.

41:57.849 --> 42:00.184
Monty, what happened?

42:02.353 --> 42:06.648
Rose, you better sit down for this.

42:11.362 --> 42:14.823
Is it mother?

42:15.366 --> 42:18.160
Rose, there was a plane crash.

42:19.496 --> 42:23.290
Your mother earned her wings.

42:24.334 --> 42:28.795
It's all right. It's all right, baby.

42:30.048 --> 42:31.882
"And to my nephew Clive,

42:32.091 --> 42:34.384
"son of my beloved departed brother,

42:34.594 --> 42:37.888
"whom I've undertaken to
raise as a son of my own,

42:38.097 --> 42:41.892
"in as much as he has always
led a simple, virtuous life,

42:42.101 --> 42:45.395
"and because it is my wish
that he continue to do so,

42:45.605 --> 42:50.442
"I bequeath to him an additional
income of $5,000 a year

42:50.652 --> 42:52.486
for the rest of his life."

42:52.695 --> 42:55.989
Ah there must be some mistake, Dan.

42:56.533 --> 42:59.952
- There must be some more zeroes.
- No.

43:00.161 --> 43:01.954
Um, a comma?

43:02.163 --> 43:03.956
No.

43:04.499 --> 43:06.500
"To my beloved daughter, Rose,

43:06.793 --> 43:10.671
"burdened as she is with
cares and responsibilities,

43:10.880 --> 43:13.757
"I bequeath the remainder of my estate,

43:13.967 --> 43:16.593
"which includes
Monahan's Department Store,

43:16.803 --> 43:19.179
estimated worth, $10 million."

43:19.389 --> 43:21.181
Oh!

43:21.391 --> 43:24.184
"If, and only if, her husband Monty

43:24.394 --> 43:26.186
can reform himself in one year."

43:26.396 --> 43:29.147
What kind of reform you talking' about?

43:29.357 --> 43:32.734
There is a codicil attached
to the will, Mr. Capalooti.

43:32.944 --> 43:35.612
- That's Capuletti.
- Mr. Capuletti.

43:35.822 --> 43:39.741
Which lists the activities
which are to be proscribed:

43:39.951 --> 43:44.788
That is, the things
you must refrain from.

43:52.338 --> 43:54.715
- No smoking.
- No philandering.

43:54.924 --> 43:56.925
- No gambling.
- No drugs.

43:57.135 --> 43:58.135
No alcohol.

43:58.344 --> 44:00.804
No alcohol? Does that go for beer too?

44:01.014 --> 44:02.222
Certainly.

44:02.432 --> 44:06.268
And you must weigh not more
than 175 pounds.

44:06.477 --> 44:07.728
Uh, question?

44:07.937 --> 44:11.773
Assuming Monty can't reform,
perish the thought...

44:11.983 --> 44:14.776
Oh, then you get the money.

44:14.986 --> 44:16.820
I do?

44:29.083 --> 44:32.252
- Forget about it. I'm not doin' it.
- You're right, forget it.

44:32.462 --> 44:37.341
Daddy, come on, you can do it!
It's $10 million!

44:39.218 --> 44:40.761
Oh, and Mr. Capalooti,

44:40.970 --> 44:43.764
should you decide to accept these terms,

44:43.973 --> 44:47.351
remember we'll be watching you.

44:49.896 --> 44:53.857
I need a drink and a cigarette
so I can think this over, ya know.

44:55.777 --> 44:58.153
Twelve months? Forget about it.

44:58.363 --> 45:00.656
You can do that standing on your head.

45:00.865 --> 45:02.240
It's easy money.

45:02.533 --> 45:04.451
Hey, that's a lot of money, Monty.

45:04.661 --> 45:06.953
That could parlay
into a fortune for you.

45:08.164 --> 45:11.458
I couldn't care less,
Monty, but think of the kids.

45:12.001 --> 45:15.462
- Think about mommy.
- Think of your wife, and your kids.

45:19.050 --> 45:21.510
Think of me, ya bum!

46:09.642 --> 46:11.977
Monty, breakfast is ready.

46:13.229 --> 46:15.105
Oh, breakfast. Beautiful.

46:15.314 --> 46:17.649
I stopped smoking. I'm starvin'.

46:17.859 --> 46:20.235
- Dad, pass the syrup.
- Here, here.

46:22.238 --> 46:24.489
Rose, you gave me the wrong plate.

46:24.699 --> 46:26.992
Where's the rest of my eggs
and my home fries?

46:27.702 --> 46:30.662
These are the rest of your eggs,
these are your home fries,

46:30.872 --> 46:33.707
and this is applesauce.

46:38.463 --> 46:42.132
Belinda, I can't eat all my home fries.
Want some home fries?

46:42.341 --> 46:44.134
No, thanks.

46:44.343 --> 46:47.846
Here, Monty.
Oohhh, pass them to Belinda.

46:48.055 --> 46:50.307
If you wanna lose weight,
you should start now.

46:53.770 --> 46:55.645
Ooh, food.

46:55.855 --> 46:58.690
- It's a tough give-up.
- Allison, eat.

46:58.900 --> 47:01.735
Allison, you gotta eat.

47:02.278 --> 47:03.737
I know marriage is rough.

47:04.280 --> 47:07.199
It's not all moonlight and canoes.
That's in the movies.

47:07.408 --> 47:10.202
- I don't wanna talk about it.
- What's the matter with you?

47:10.411 --> 47:13.747
You don't eat. You don't talk to no one.

47:14.248 --> 47:16.666
You lock yourself in
your room all night.

47:16.876 --> 47:19.503
The way you're carrying on,
you'll never meet another guy.

47:27.136 --> 47:28.428
What'd I say?

47:28.638 --> 47:30.430
"You'll never meet another guy."

47:30.640 --> 47:32.349
Take out the garbage.

47:34.018 --> 47:36.186
Take out the garbage.

47:36.395 --> 47:39.648
I didn't even eat,
I gotta take out the garbage.

47:42.819 --> 47:44.778
Hi.

47:56.833 --> 47:59.292
She ain't worth $10 million.

48:03.422 --> 48:05.423
$5 million, maybe.

49:02.148 --> 49:04.566
Hey, not here! Not here!

49:04.775 --> 49:07.569
I'm your new neighbor, Bill Jones.
You can call me Bill.

49:07.778 --> 49:10.530
Not here! Why don't you take
him on your property, huh?

49:10.740 --> 49:12.949
Take it easy, you interrupt
King's business he gets very upset.

49:13.159 --> 49:15.577
What makes you think I wanna
inherit his business?

49:15.786 --> 49:17.579
If you feel so bad, I'll clean it up.

49:17.788 --> 49:18.538
Sure.

49:18.748 --> 49:22.167
So you're Monty Capuletti.
Congratulations on your daughter's wedding.

49:22.376 --> 49:25.962
Some party, I heard about.
What am I telling you for, you were there.

49:26.172 --> 49:29.549
Look, I'm your next door neighbor now,
so we gotta get to be good buddies.

49:29.759 --> 49:32.969
I wanna have a relationship. Most important
thing for us, we gotta have a good rapport.

49:33.179 --> 49:35.055
Wait till you meet Ginger.
She's my better half.

49:35.264 --> 49:38.558
I already saw your better half.
In fact, I saw more than half.

49:38.768 --> 49:41.561
She's a dynamite girl. I met her
in Vegas a couple of years ago.

49:41.771 --> 49:44.606
Oh, man, she's a loving,
caring, sharing person.

49:44.815 --> 49:46.483
Someone maybe one day you
can become friendly with.

49:46.692 --> 49:48.652
I needed you two to move in next door.

49:48.861 --> 49:51.363
I'm nervous enough this morning.
Are you kiddin'?

49:51.572 --> 49:54.115
Nervous, maybe you need a little smoke.

49:54.325 --> 49:57.118
Little ups, little downs, little something.
I got anything you need.

49:57.328 --> 49:58.828
What are you talkin' to
me about drugs for?

49:59.038 --> 50:00.622
I got my daughter here.
She's 12 years old.

50:00.831 --> 50:03.583
Look, you got a connection in
the family already, stick with it.

50:03.793 --> 50:07.003
But just this once, I'll tell you what,
my friend. Let me be Santa Claus.

50:07.213 --> 50:10.674
There's one, two, from me to you.
We'll take a hike. Come on pouchy.

50:28.901 --> 50:32.946
One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

50:35.658 --> 50:39.202
Two, four, six, eight, ten.
Two, four, six, eight, ten.

50:49.964 --> 50:51.756
This is ridiculous.

50:51.966 --> 50:54.259
But daddy, jogging's good for you.

50:54.468 --> 50:58.805
Thanks to jogging, more people than
ever are dropping dead in perfect health.

51:10.609 --> 51:12.861
Five more.

51:16.407 --> 51:20.201
- Celebrity Pizza.
- Send over the usual. Eight pies.

51:20.411 --> 51:23.788
Two Lollo Brigidas, two
Jerry Vales, two Pavarottis,

51:23.956 --> 51:25.749
one Caruso and a Frank Nitti.

51:25.958 --> 51:29.044
- Monty, is that you?
- Yeah. I got a cold.

51:34.884 --> 51:37.761
Stay right there. I'll get some money.

51:38.888 --> 51:40.013
C'mon, what am I asking for?

51:40.222 --> 51:42.265
One slice.
You can stay up late, all right?

51:46.937 --> 51:48.980
The top one had anchovies.

51:53.944 --> 51:55.278
All right, who's in?

51:58.491 --> 52:00.909
Come on, pick the date he blows it.

52:09.919 --> 52:11.836
Great guy you are, you know that?

52:12.046 --> 52:15.340
Can't wait till he blows it, huh?
Bettin' on it and everything.

52:15.549 --> 52:17.884
Listen to you.
What, are you some kind of altar boy?

52:18.177 --> 52:20.178
Huh? You're some influence.

52:20.387 --> 52:22.806
You gamble in front of him,
you drink in front of him.

52:23.057 --> 52:25.266
Hey, Monty see, Monty do, you know.

52:30.981 --> 52:35.360
Hector, Hector. Don't push me.

52:35.569 --> 52:38.363
Listen to me. It's gonna work.

52:38.572 --> 52:40.365
See these pennies?

52:40.574 --> 52:44.869
You take these pennies, you throw 'em
at the window, and I'll be in the bush.

52:45.079 --> 52:47.330
I saw it in a movie once.
It's gonna work perfect.

52:47.540 --> 52:50.750
If you need any help, just listen
to what I'm gonna tell you to say.

52:50.960 --> 52:53.378
Go on. Go get 'em.

52:53.587 --> 52:56.881
- Where you going?
- I'll be in the bush.

52:57.091 --> 52:58.883
Throw the pennies.

52:59.093 --> 53:02.011
- You're gonna be behind the bush?
- I'll be right here.

53:14.525 --> 53:15.900
Who's there?

53:21.031 --> 53:23.992
Hey. How are you?

53:26.036 --> 53:28.163
I was just, uh...

53:29.081 --> 53:30.874
I was in the neighborhood,

53:31.083 --> 53:34.919
and thought I'd stop by,
see what's cooking.

53:35.129 --> 53:38.464
- That Julio?
- Yeah.

53:40.509 --> 53:43.928
- What do I say?
- Tell her to come down.

53:44.138 --> 53:46.347
Prove to her you're the man.

53:48.517 --> 53:51.227
Come down. I'm the man.

53:51.437 --> 53:53.938
Get tough. Tell her you're bad.

53:54.148 --> 53:55.815
- I'm bad.
- Like you mean it.

53:56.025 --> 54:00.028
Allison! I'm bad.

54:00.571 --> 54:02.947
No, no, no!

54:03.157 --> 54:04.782
Jump up and down.

54:05.659 --> 54:09.078
- I am so bad! I am so bad!
- Be angry.

54:09.288 --> 54:12.916
- Who are you talking to?
- Julio and the hedge.

54:13.125 --> 54:15.960
I'm so bad, I should be in detention.

54:16.170 --> 54:18.504
No, no. Be mean.

54:19.048 --> 54:21.549
Wave your arms.
Make believe you're angry.

54:21.842 --> 54:23.468
Listen to me.

54:23.677 --> 54:25.303
I'm not that kind of guy

54:25.512 --> 54:28.973
that's gonna start playing around
in the driveway of a tract house!

54:29.183 --> 54:33.061
I'm not gonna lose my temper
in front of the woman that I love!

54:35.606 --> 54:38.483
Get on your knees. Beg her.

54:38.692 --> 54:41.569
Tell her you're thinking
of killing yourself.

54:44.615 --> 54:48.076
No. I don't talk like that.

54:48.619 --> 54:52.288
Do you hear me? I don't talk like that.

54:53.582 --> 54:57.961
If you know so much about women,
you talk to her.

54:58.212 --> 55:00.505
The hedge, Allison Capuletti.

55:00.714 --> 55:03.967
Allison, the hedge has
a few words to say to you.

55:04.718 --> 55:08.513
- I don't know what to say.
- Oh, now you don't know what to say!

55:08.722 --> 55:12.517
Allison, Julio's very unhappy.

55:12.726 --> 55:16.771
- You made a fool out of me!
- Get off of my ear! Let go of my leg!

55:22.528 --> 55:25.530
Saturday lunch.
I can have a piece of fruit, citrus,

55:25.739 --> 55:27.532
or four ounces of fish.

55:27.741 --> 55:29.534
I think I'll have the fruit.

55:29.743 --> 55:31.744
Sometimes with the fish,
these guys go over.

55:31.954 --> 55:33.037
What'll you have, buddy?

55:33.247 --> 55:36.499
- Two with sauerkraut and a Yoo-Hoo.
- Got it.

55:36.709 --> 55:41.045
Two with sauerkraut. Yoo-Hoo.

55:41.255 --> 55:44.590
- What do you want, buddy?
- Nothin'. I'll just smell his.

55:52.141 --> 55:54.058
You know why I'm going
through this whole thing, Nicky?

55:54.268 --> 55:56.060
For my kids, that's why.

55:56.270 --> 55:59.063
That's the greatest love in the world,
your kids. You can't beat it.

55:59.273 --> 56:02.567
That's why you do things.
That's love, for your kids.

56:02.776 --> 56:05.069
See what I mean, see that man
over there with his kid?

56:05.279 --> 56:09.073
That's love. Look at the way he loves
the kid, bouncing him on his knee.

56:09.283 --> 56:11.159
That's love, baby, I'll tell you that.

56:11.368 --> 56:14.579
There he is!
Thank goodness he's all right!

56:14.788 --> 56:17.457
What's going on? I'm sitting here minding
my business, he jumped on my lap.

56:17.666 --> 56:19.459
- Get away from my kid!
- Everybody calm down.

56:19.668 --> 56:21.586
- Do you have some identification, sir?
- It's in my other raincoat.

56:21.795 --> 56:24.297
Didn't I tell you to never wander
away from mommy again?

56:24.506 --> 56:26.674
Spit that out right now!

56:34.641 --> 56:36.392
Come on.

56:40.230 --> 56:42.690
It's all ready. Come on, give it a shot.

56:47.738 --> 56:50.198
You gotta go 30 miles an hour

56:50.491 --> 56:52.992
for 15 minutes for it to do anything.

56:54.370 --> 56:56.954
Come on, faster, faster. Come on.

56:57.164 --> 56:59.499
Faster. You gotta get it up to speed.

56:59.708 --> 57:02.568
Faster, faster, faster!

57:04.088 --> 57:07.006
Faster. 30 miles. Faster. Faster.

57:07.216 --> 57:11.803
- Oh, my!
- Oh, no! Oh.

57:18.644 --> 57:21.229
Come on. Keep quiet.
Keep your head down.

57:21.772 --> 57:23.648
- Is my hair too flat?
- No.

57:23.857 --> 57:25.775
You look great. Come on.

57:26.860 --> 57:30.655
Come on, Julio. Okay. Gimme that.

57:30.864 --> 57:34.617
It's locked.
Let's go play Space Invaders.

57:34.910 --> 57:37.161
No. We'll go up the drain pipe.

57:37.371 --> 57:40.123
Don't worry about it.
Everything's gonna be all right.

57:40.332 --> 57:44.043
- I will not. I won't go up that way.
- All you gotta do is climb up.

57:44.253 --> 57:46.170
Come on. Come on.

57:46.380 --> 57:48.589
You can do it! You bad!

57:50.759 --> 57:53.761
I had to hook up with
the only virgin in New York.

57:53.971 --> 57:56.639
Didn't they teach this at school?

57:56.849 --> 57:59.684
They taught math at your school,
but you can't divide.

57:59.893 --> 58:01.811
At least I can multiply.

58:03.313 --> 58:05.690
You sure this is Allison's bedroom?

58:05.899 --> 58:08.776
I know this place like
the back of my hand.

58:18.829 --> 58:20.163
What happened?

58:20.372 --> 58:23.749
I got the back of my
hand stuck in the toilet.

58:31.925 --> 58:35.386
Listen to me. You gotta be quiet.

58:35.929 --> 58:37.638
We gotta be quiet.

58:40.434 --> 58:42.810
- Where's the light?
- Shh!

58:44.438 --> 58:46.355
That isn't a light.

58:47.065 --> 58:50.359
That's not the light.
And this is not the light.

58:52.404 --> 58:54.947
That's the water pik.

59:01.371 --> 59:03.706
Here's the plan.

59:03.916 --> 59:06.209
I'm gonna go talk to Allison.

59:06.460 --> 59:09.003
When I leave the room, you...

59:13.425 --> 59:15.676
We're in here.

59:27.898 --> 59:29.857
Just be calm.

59:30.400 --> 59:32.818
Just be calm, and get out the window.

59:40.410 --> 59:42.370
Ow!

59:43.914 --> 59:45.748
- I'll meet you down by the car.
- Yeah.

59:45.958 --> 59:48.751
I'll be all right. Don't worry about it.

59:52.756 --> 59:54.298
Julio!

59:54.508 --> 59:56.842
Julio!

01:00:18.532 --> 01:00:21.075
I'll have a number three
with flour tortillas.

01:00:21.285 --> 01:00:23.661
Mmm. Two of them.

01:00:26.665 --> 01:00:30.626
Um, I'll have the special. Number one.

01:00:33.672 --> 01:00:37.508
I'll have a junior salad. No dressing.

01:00:41.680 --> 01:00:43.598
Why don't you stop carryin' on,
huh Monty?

01:00:43.807 --> 01:00:46.726
Rate you're goin', I'll bet you a hundred
bucks you're not gonna make it.

01:00:47.811 --> 01:00:51.230
If I bet you, then I won't make it.

01:00:52.316 --> 01:00:56.110
Just remember: when the going gets
tough, the tough get going.

01:00:56.320 --> 01:00:57.862
What if you're not tough?

01:00:58.822 --> 01:01:00.615
You gotta be strong like me.

01:01:00.824 --> 01:01:02.617
Look. What is this? Nothin'.

01:01:02.826 --> 01:01:06.078
Put it right out.
It's not gonna be my master.

01:01:09.207 --> 01:01:11.167
Gimme a light, Lou.

01:01:15.213 --> 01:01:19.133
Mmm, Monty, you gotta have discilton.

01:01:19.343 --> 01:01:21.093
Discipline.

01:01:23.722 --> 01:01:27.642
- Can I have your olive?
- You got extra olives?

01:01:27.851 --> 01:01:30.144
You want the black one or the green one?

01:01:30.354 --> 01:01:33.731
- Which one you want?
- It's up to you. Take the green one.

01:01:37.778 --> 01:01:42.156
Just a minute Okay, you gotta
stay still. Okay, kid?

01:01:42.366 --> 01:01:45.159
You gotta stay still.
Kid, you gotta stay still.

01:01:45.369 --> 01:01:47.578
Monty, have you ever seen
a face like that before?

01:01:47.788 --> 01:01:49.622
No. If I did, I'd remember it.

01:01:49.831 --> 01:01:53.376
Okay, I'm gonna get a real
good picture now. Okay?

01:01:53.585 --> 01:01:57.755
- Look at him! He's got my eyes.
- He's got my nose.

01:01:57.964 --> 01:02:00.758
And my sympathy. All right.

01:02:00.967 --> 01:02:02.843
We want some wallet-size pictures too.

01:02:03.845 --> 01:02:06.055
This kid won't fit in a wallet-size.

01:02:06.264 --> 01:02:09.183
Make 'em good pictures.
My wife's very particular.

01:02:09.393 --> 01:02:12.561
What about you, John?
He's very particular too.

01:02:12.771 --> 01:02:15.064
I'm surprised you married each other.

01:02:15.273 --> 01:02:17.566
All right. Look, kid.

01:02:17.776 --> 01:02:21.862
I'm tired of telling you the same thing.
You gotta stay still. I'll tell you what.

01:02:22.072 --> 01:02:24.448
Anthony, I'm gonna make a deal with you.

01:02:24.658 --> 01:02:25.950
Anthony, pay attention.

01:02:26.159 --> 01:02:27.993
You gotta stay still.

01:02:28.203 --> 01:02:30.287
If we wanna get a good picture,
we gotta stay still.

01:02:30.497 --> 01:02:32.957
We wanna get a good picture, Anthony.

01:02:33.166 --> 01:02:37.044
Stay still. Stay still.
Help that kid out, will ya?

01:02:37.254 --> 01:02:40.047
- Talk to him, grandma.
- Here we go, Anthony.

01:02:40.257 --> 01:02:43.467
Be quiet.

01:02:43.677 --> 01:02:47.012
Stay still. Quiet, will ya!

01:02:47.556 --> 01:02:50.975
Blanche, John, grandma,
talk to him, will ya? Stay quiet!

01:02:51.184 --> 01:02:54.478
Hey, kid, be quiet, will ya?

01:02:54.688 --> 01:02:58.023
Somebody! Will you shut
the fat little bastard up?

01:02:58.233 --> 01:03:00.109
What is the law?

01:03:00.318 --> 01:03:04.113
Not to go on all fours.

01:03:04.322 --> 01:03:07.116
- That is the law.
- What is the law?

01:03:07.325 --> 01:03:10.619
Not to shed blood.

01:03:10.829 --> 01:03:14.581
His prices are insane!

01:03:16.293 --> 01:03:19.086
All we need is one pin, Rodney.

01:03:19.296 --> 01:03:22.089
Now, back to "Lost Weekend."

01:03:22.299 --> 01:03:26.677
He who breaks the law must
go to the house of pain.

01:03:26.887 --> 01:03:28.596
Back to the pain!

01:03:32.726 --> 01:03:34.226
Monty.

01:03:41.735 --> 01:03:44.153
Monty, it's 3:00 in the morning.

01:03:44.362 --> 01:03:48.157
Come to bed. You haven't had
a decent night's sleep in weeks.

01:03:49.367 --> 01:03:53.078
I don't know how to sleep.
I know how to pass out.

01:03:59.252 --> 01:04:01.629
Maybe you should see a doctor.

01:04:01.838 --> 01:04:03.380
If I see a doctor,
I'll blow the whole thing.

01:04:03.590 --> 01:04:05.633
They give you sleeping pills.

01:04:05.842 --> 01:04:08.677
You know what I do when I can't sleep?

01:04:08.887 --> 01:04:11.514
- What?
- I knit.

01:04:12.891 --> 01:04:15.684
Maybe I'll knit myself a beer.

01:04:15.894 --> 01:04:18.771
How about some hot milk?
It'll do you good.

01:04:19.898 --> 01:04:21.774
I'll try anything.

01:04:24.277 --> 01:04:27.780
- Hot milk.
- Come on.

01:04:38.792 --> 01:04:41.669
Monty, I know what you're going through.

01:04:41.878 --> 01:04:44.255
Do you wanna talk about it?

01:04:53.306 --> 01:04:54.723
You know your friend Blanche Genaro?

01:04:54.933 --> 01:04:55.724
Uh-huh.

01:04:55.934 --> 01:05:00.739
Her kid Anthony,
I called him a fat little bastard.

01:05:03.859 --> 01:05:07.236
Very funny. We're laughin'
and I'm out of a job.

01:05:07.445 --> 01:05:09.822
Monty, you're a great photographer.

01:05:14.870 --> 01:05:18.706
- You'll get another job.
- Yeah, when?

01:05:18.915 --> 01:05:20.708
Meanwhile, I got nothing to do.

01:05:20.917 --> 01:05:23.711
What do people do when
they're not getting loaded?

01:05:24.421 --> 01:05:27.131
What you have to do
is change your habits.

01:05:27.340 --> 01:05:29.216
Yeah? Who you been talking to?

01:05:29.426 --> 01:05:31.760
Mrs. Dugan. She's an expert.

01:05:31.970 --> 01:05:35.431
She had three husbands.
They all died of alcohol.

01:05:35.640 --> 01:05:38.017
She's no expert, she's a carrier.

01:05:44.357 --> 01:05:46.734
You know what I was
thinking about today?

01:05:47.485 --> 01:05:50.779
Coney Island. When the kids were small?

01:05:52.115 --> 01:05:54.700
Remember the time
you put Allison on the pony

01:05:54.910 --> 01:05:57.786
and you tried to make the pony
smile to make Allison smile?

01:05:58.330 --> 01:06:02.249
- I never laughed so hard.
- That was the good old days.

01:06:02.459 --> 01:06:05.085
If I make it through this,
I'll buy you Coney Island.

01:06:05.295 --> 01:06:09.840
I don't need Coney Island. I need you.

01:07:01.059 --> 01:07:03.602
- Hi, Nicky.
- Hi, Rose.

01:07:04.562 --> 01:07:07.856
- Hey, kid.
- Oh, yo, nick.

01:07:08.066 --> 01:07:11.360
- What are you playing, Mozart?
- Scales.

01:07:11.569 --> 01:07:13.562
Scales? Never heard of him.

01:07:18.076 --> 01:07:20.786
Rose! Rose! Rose!

01:07:20.996 --> 01:07:23.330
Hey, whoa! What are you doin'?

01:07:23.540 --> 01:07:25.332
What's going on?
What, are you crackin' up?

01:07:25.542 --> 01:07:28.419
I tell you, Nicky,
it's rough. It's rough.

01:07:30.964 --> 01:07:33.424
What's the matter with you?
What is this?

01:07:33.967 --> 01:07:35.426
Rose told me I need hobbies.

01:07:35.969 --> 01:07:37.928
I'm making a plane.
It's a messerschmitt.

01:07:41.474 --> 01:07:43.434
It's a nice job.

01:07:43.977 --> 01:07:45.769
I tell ya, I'm fed up with everything.

01:07:45.979 --> 01:07:48.647
I wanna go to sleep and wake up four
months from now when it's all over.

01:07:48.857 --> 01:07:51.942
You know what your problem is?
This whole thing ain't real to you.

01:07:52.235 --> 01:07:53.777
You don't know what you're coming into.

01:07:53.987 --> 01:07:55.404
Did you ever see
Monahan's Department Store?

01:07:55.613 --> 01:07:57.906
Once from the outside
when I dropped Rose off.

01:07:58.116 --> 01:07:59.575
Why don't we go see it from the inside?

01:07:59.784 --> 01:08:01.410
What do you say, come on.
We'll have a few laughs.

01:08:01.619 --> 01:08:04.204
Huh? Come on. I need a new shirt anyway.

01:08:08.001 --> 01:08:11.378
Rose, there's a messerschmitt in
the kitchen. Clean it up, will ya?

01:08:24.017 --> 01:08:25.059
Some joint, huh?

01:08:26.685 --> 01:08:29.188
When you take over, let me
fix the bathrooms here.

01:08:32.692 --> 01:08:35.109
They don't go to the bathroom here.

01:08:36.279 --> 01:08:38.154
See this?

01:08:49.501 --> 01:08:51.502
Could somebody help us here?

01:08:52.796 --> 01:08:54.630
I don't think so.

01:08:56.299 --> 01:08:59.093
I tell ya, my friend here, he's look...

01:08:59.301 --> 01:09:01.636
I tell ya, my friend here,
he's lookin' for a shirt.

01:09:02.180 --> 01:09:04.680
Yeah. You have something
in a dark black?

01:09:05.809 --> 01:09:08.602
He wants something he can
wear four, five days in a row.

01:09:11.731 --> 01:09:14.108
You have any men's shirts for men?

01:09:14.317 --> 01:09:16.693
Have you tried the Army/Navy store?

01:09:17.237 --> 01:09:21.115
Very funny. One more word
out of you, and he gets it.

01:09:21.323 --> 01:09:23.700
Come on.

01:09:24.243 --> 01:09:27.662
Why don't you two put your heads together,
make an ass out of yourselves?

01:09:33.211 --> 01:09:34.252
Where're you goin'?

01:09:34.462 --> 01:09:36.171
It says, "Come In And Browse."

01:09:38.716 --> 01:09:43.345
- May I help you?
- No, thank you. Just browsing.

01:09:44.346 --> 01:09:46.640
What have they got in
this place, antiques?

01:09:47.350 --> 01:09:49.143
No, those are the customers.

01:09:49.352 --> 01:09:53.147
- May I help you?
- No, thanks. Just browsing.

01:09:53.356 --> 01:09:56.650
How long do you intend to browse?

01:09:56.860 --> 01:10:00.571
That lady, you didn't ask her
how long she intends to browse.

01:10:00.780 --> 01:10:02.739
How come you're asking us
how long we intend to browse?

01:10:02.949 --> 01:10:04.658
You don't look like browsers.

01:10:04.868 --> 01:10:08.036
- What do browsers look like?
- Maybe I'm half browser.

01:10:08.288 --> 01:10:09.371
On his father's side.

01:10:09.581 --> 01:10:12.624
Nevertheless, I prefer that you
do not browse any longer.

01:10:12.834 --> 01:10:14.334
Yeah, well it's a free country.

01:10:14.544 --> 01:10:16.545
Yeah, if these people can browse,
we can browse.

01:10:16.754 --> 01:10:19.173
Nicky, let's show the
lady we're browsers, huh?

01:10:19.382 --> 01:10:21.675
Hey, look at us. We're browsing.

01:10:21.885 --> 01:10:26.680
- Hey, ducks in heat.
- Please! That's 18th century.

01:10:26.890 --> 01:10:29.183
Folks, better keep browsing
or she'll kick you out of here.

01:10:29.392 --> 01:10:33.187
- Look at us. We're browsing.
- Is this an odd or an end?

01:10:33.396 --> 01:10:36.732
Hey lady, if I buy two odds,
will you show us your end?

01:10:36.941 --> 01:10:38.525
Ohh!

01:10:40.028 --> 01:10:43.780
Security. Security! Security!

01:10:47.619 --> 01:10:50.495
- Yes?
- Mr. Barlow, please.

01:10:51.497 --> 01:10:54.791
- What is it?
- Do you know a Monty Capuletti?

01:10:55.001 --> 01:10:57.294
- Yes.
- Well, he's on his way upstairs.

01:10:57.503 --> 01:10:59.379
Is he?

01:11:05.929 --> 01:11:10.349
Gentlemen, let's shelve these
petty matters for the moment.

01:11:10.558 --> 01:11:13.852
The son-in-law of our late, beloved
president is on his way to join us,

01:11:14.062 --> 01:11:17.689
so let's just sit around
and smoke and drink.

01:11:17.899 --> 01:11:19.691
Brent, Brice!

01:11:21.486 --> 01:11:24.494
Make up your mind.
Which one of us do you like?

01:11:25.823 --> 01:11:27.532
Down the hatch.

01:11:30.495 --> 01:11:34.748
Mr. Barlow, this joker
says he knows you.

01:11:34.958 --> 01:11:37.834
This joker is part of
the Monahan family, Gus.

01:11:38.044 --> 01:11:40.420
Oh, sorry, sir.

01:11:42.966 --> 01:11:46.760
People, this is Monty Capuletti
and his friend, Nick Marino.

01:11:46.970 --> 01:11:50.889
- No need to stand.
- Monty, what brings you here?

01:11:51.099 --> 01:11:53.892
Nicky was lookin' to get a shirt,
but we couldn't find any.

01:11:54.102 --> 01:11:55.894
You got nothin' in this
store nobody wants to buy.

01:11:56.104 --> 01:11:58.772
Monahan's has an upscale clientele.

01:11:58.982 --> 01:12:02.276
All our gentlemen customers
are very conscious of style.

01:12:02.485 --> 01:12:04.403
Men don't have style.

01:12:04.612 --> 01:12:07.489
Men wear clothes. Women have style.

01:12:08.491 --> 01:12:10.409
What sort of shirt were you looking for?

01:12:10.618 --> 01:12:12.411
A regular shirt.

01:12:12.620 --> 01:12:14.871
See this shirt? Every guy on
our block's got one of these.

01:12:15.081 --> 01:12:17.374
You guys don't dress regular.

01:12:17.583 --> 01:12:19.376
You got on vests. It's hot as hell here.

01:12:19.585 --> 01:12:22.879
These gentlemen and ladies were
handpicked to work for me

01:12:23.089 --> 01:12:25.181
and dress accordingly.

01:12:25.591 --> 01:12:28.599
Where'd you find these guys, Noah's Ark?

01:12:30.013 --> 01:12:33.473
And you. There's a lot of
trouble finding your fly.

01:12:35.518 --> 01:12:36.935
I really must apologize.

01:12:37.145 --> 01:12:38.687
Monty, I've made a mistake.

01:12:38.896 --> 01:12:41.940
I didn't realize what
your true talents were.

01:12:42.525 --> 01:12:47.446
- Oh, no.
- You have such fashion sense.

01:12:47.655 --> 01:12:50.282
Everything we've been buying, wrong.
All wrong.

01:12:50.491 --> 01:12:51.450
Tell us more.

01:12:51.659 --> 01:12:53.785
- Your pants.
- Our pants.

01:12:53.995 --> 01:12:55.829
You gotta have pants with lots of room

01:12:56.039 --> 01:12:57.914
so when you sit down, they don't split.

01:12:58.124 --> 01:13:00.083
And zippers that work
easy so you can fix your shorts.

01:13:00.293 --> 01:13:01.335
Know what I mean?

01:13:03.046 --> 01:13:05.380
Les slacks blousants avec le zip.

01:13:05.590 --> 01:13:06.798
Whatever you say.

01:13:07.008 --> 01:13:07.799
What about shoes?

01:13:08.009 --> 01:13:09.426
Well, you need shoes
that go on and off easy.

01:13:09.635 --> 01:13:12.971
You know, no shoe horn.
And no laces. They slow you up.

01:13:13.181 --> 01:13:14.973
Yes, I see that.

01:13:15.683 --> 01:13:21.480
Chunky, black mailman oxfords,
with adorable little white cotton socks.

01:13:21.689 --> 01:13:24.483
Big blousy bowling shirts.

01:13:24.692 --> 01:13:27.861
"Mel. The regular guy look."

01:13:28.404 --> 01:13:29.154
What?

01:13:29.364 --> 01:13:32.491
You can't be this crazy.
He looks like a rummage sale.

01:13:32.700 --> 01:13:33.784
I know what I'm doing.

01:13:33.993 --> 01:13:36.495
This is just the opportunity
I've been waiting for.

01:13:36.704 --> 01:13:39.873
You know, the boredom of unemployment
could really drive a man to drink.

01:13:40.083 --> 01:13:40.957
Yeah, so could you too.

01:13:41.167 --> 01:13:42.959
Hey, take it easy, Nicky, will ya?
Take it easy.

01:13:43.169 --> 01:13:45.045
Monty, we need a mind like yours.

01:13:45.588 --> 01:13:50.050
I'd like to offer you a position
as fashion consultant to Monahan's.

01:13:50.259 --> 01:13:51.134
Who me?

01:13:51.386 --> 01:13:54.678
I'm no fashion consultant.
What's the matter with you?

01:13:55.056 --> 01:13:56.390
Take the job. Take the job.

01:13:56.599 --> 01:13:58.517
The first thing we do is
we fire that broad downstairs

01:13:58.726 --> 01:14:01.029
that stopped us from browsing.

01:14:01.979 --> 01:14:05.023
Get me Sergio. Track down Alfonso.
Draw up a budget for Mr. Capuletti.

01:14:05.233 --> 01:14:07.567
Let's leak the story to the press.

01:14:17.245 --> 01:14:18.036
Hello.

01:14:18.246 --> 01:14:20.956
- Mr. Capuletti, please.
- It's for you. It's your wife.

01:14:24.043 --> 01:14:25.919
Hey Rose, they took all my clothes!

01:14:26.129 --> 01:14:28.004
When are you coming home?

01:14:28.214 --> 01:14:30.298
How can I come home?
I got nothing to wear.

01:14:30.967 --> 01:14:32.759
I'll call you later. Here, take this.

01:14:32.969 --> 01:14:35.303
- Turn away, please.
- Next shirt.

01:14:35.513 --> 01:14:37.305
Take it easy, honey. I got no good side.

01:14:37.515 --> 01:14:39.933
Could you please turn away?

01:14:40.852 --> 01:14:43.311
Scrape all the gum off the
soles and analyze the shoes.

01:14:43.521 --> 01:14:46.815
- Should these shorts be duplicated?
- Yes, duplicated and fumigated.

01:14:47.024 --> 01:14:49.317
Mr. Barlow, I have the
blacks for the shirts.

01:14:49.527 --> 01:14:51.903
That's Mr. Capuletti's department now.

01:14:53.948 --> 01:14:57.325
I have midnight black,
raven black, licorice black...

01:14:57.535 --> 01:14:59.619
If Nicky was here,
you'd have black-and-blue black.

01:15:00.621 --> 01:15:01.663
Twelve inches.

01:15:02.331 --> 01:15:04.082
Boy, you're way off.

01:15:12.049 --> 01:15:15.469
Ladies and gentlemen.
Compliments of Monty Capuletti,

01:15:15.678 --> 01:15:18.972
invitations to the premiere of
Monahan's "The Regular Guy Look."

01:15:19.182 --> 01:15:20.974
Barkeeper, I'll have
a Perrier with a twist.

01:15:21.184 --> 01:15:23.977
I'm sorry. I only have Perrier on draft.

01:15:24.187 --> 01:15:26.396
Nicholas, Patrick,
how good to see you again.

01:15:26.606 --> 01:15:29.483
I know what you're thinking.
Why am I slumming?

01:15:29.692 --> 01:15:33.487
Well, I'm here to hand-deliver
these invitations to you.

01:15:33.696 --> 01:15:36.031
But I'm not sure if you should attend.

01:15:37.200 --> 01:15:39.075
We're his friends.
We'll be there. Gimme.

01:15:39.535 --> 01:15:41.369
Well, it's your decision
and I'm sure your

01:15:41.579 --> 01:15:44.039
intentions are the best,
but think about it.

01:15:44.248 --> 01:15:46.708
It's not good for Monty to associate

01:15:46.918 --> 01:15:49.461
with people who do what he used to do.

01:15:49.712 --> 01:15:53.006
- We would protect him from that.
- He's talking about us.

01:15:53.216 --> 01:15:56.009
If you really are Monty's friends,
you'll stop making it hard for him.

01:15:56.219 --> 01:15:58.512
Look at you. You're smoking, drinking.

01:15:58.721 --> 01:16:01.014
We're in a bar.
What do you expect us to do?

01:16:01.224 --> 01:16:03.016
You must think I'm stupid or something.

01:16:03.226 --> 01:16:05.018
I look like I just got off a boat?

01:16:05.728 --> 01:16:06.686
I know what you're trying to do.

01:16:06.896 --> 01:16:09.022
Go ahead, get out of here you half
a sissy before I give you a slap.

01:16:09.232 --> 01:16:10.941
Hey Nicky, take it easy, will ya?

01:16:11.734 --> 01:16:16.613
Nick, you do want Monty to
have the money, don't you?

01:16:21.160 --> 01:16:23.078
Hey, what do you let it get to you for?

01:16:23.287 --> 01:16:24.704
He just wants the money.

01:16:26.415 --> 01:16:27.832
But what bothers me is he's right.

01:16:28.042 --> 01:16:29.251
So he's right.

01:16:30.253 --> 01:16:32.546
Think he's right?
I mean, Nicky's his coach.

01:16:32.755 --> 01:16:35.549
He tells him eat fruit,
tells him to exercise.

01:16:36.259 --> 01:16:39.886
It's not what he says, it's what we do.
It's peer pressure.

01:16:41.264 --> 01:16:44.099
Oh, yeah. Our lives are attractive.

01:16:57.071 --> 01:16:59.197
I guess Nicky and Paddy won't show.

01:17:01.534 --> 01:17:03.451
They didn't call, either, huh?

01:17:03.661 --> 01:17:05.870
- No.
- Tonight, we present

01:17:06.038 --> 01:17:08.415
our tribute to the American silhouette.

01:17:08.624 --> 01:17:12.519
Ladies and gentlemen,
"The Regular Guy Look."

01:17:16.591 --> 01:17:20.468
Jonathan and Billy are wearing
the regular guy leisure look for fall.

01:17:20.678 --> 01:17:23.471
Bold print, double-knit polyester pants

01:17:23.681 --> 01:17:27.017
with totally
non-coordinated print shirts.

01:17:29.353 --> 01:17:32.822
Pie is wearing the Italian
restaurant look.

01:17:34.609 --> 01:17:37.319
Perfect for picnics where you
can be your own tablecloth.

01:17:37.528 --> 01:17:40.989
Tie has the bowling alley sportif look.

01:17:41.198 --> 01:17:43.992
Next up is Peter, wearing

01:17:44.201 --> 01:17:47.454
the regular guy lounge look in black

01:17:47.663 --> 01:17:49.664
on black, on black.

01:17:51.375 --> 01:17:55.045
I think they like it.
Everyone's smiling.

01:17:58.132 --> 01:18:02.510
You like to gamble, take a chance
on the regular guy robe.

01:18:10.895 --> 01:18:14.564
American classic,
iridescent blue sharkskin.

01:18:20.154 --> 01:18:22.530
That suit. Look at that suit.

01:18:22.740 --> 01:18:24.616
Have you seen the suit...

01:18:27.453 --> 01:18:28.536
And now...

01:18:28.746 --> 01:18:32.916
I'd like to introduce the man
responsible for this evening.

01:18:33.125 --> 01:18:36.002
Mr. Monty Capuletti!

01:18:36.212 --> 01:18:38.288
Take a bow, Monty.

01:19:00.152 --> 01:19:02.570
Fatty. Eating again, fatty, fatty?

01:19:02.780 --> 01:19:05.573
Fatty, fatty. Eating
again, fatty, fatty?

01:19:05.783 --> 01:19:09.077
Fatty, fatty, fatty...

01:19:09.286 --> 01:19:11.538
- Who put this in here?
- I was only trying to help.

01:19:11.747 --> 01:19:12.914
Well don't help.

01:19:13.124 --> 01:19:15.166
I'm tired of people trying to help me.

01:19:17.169 --> 01:19:20.547
- Monty, calm down.
- What are you lookin' at?

01:19:20.756 --> 01:19:22.549
Go upstairs and clean your room.
It's a pigsty.

01:19:22.758 --> 01:19:24.551
Leave me alone!

01:19:25.261 --> 01:19:29.097
- I know what you're thinkin' too.
- Oh, god.

01:19:29.306 --> 01:19:31.474
All I ever wanted was a happy family.

01:19:31.684 --> 01:19:34.102
That's all I ever asked for,
a happy family.

01:19:34.311 --> 01:19:38.148
A family that loved each other.
I never cared about anything else.

01:19:40.651 --> 01:19:43.153
Stop it, will ya.
I can't take it no more.

01:19:44.488 --> 01:19:46.489
Money caused all this.

01:19:47.324 --> 01:19:51.119
I don't wanna be rich.
We're not supposed to be rich.

01:19:51.328 --> 01:19:54.497
We don't look rich, we don't
talk rich, we don't smell rich!

01:19:54.707 --> 01:19:58.626
No more rich! I want our house
to be the way it was.

01:20:04.216 --> 01:20:07.510
Hey, fatty, fatty.

01:20:07.720 --> 01:20:10.388
- Monty, where are you going?
- I'll be at Louie's.

01:20:11.307 --> 01:20:12.265
Gettin' drunk!

01:20:12.475 --> 01:20:14.392
Take this, Julio. Go and get her.

01:20:14.602 --> 01:20:16.311
She's your wife. Go ahead, go get her.

01:20:16.520 --> 01:20:17.896
Right, she's my wife.

01:20:18.105 --> 01:20:19.898
A gun. I don't want a gun.

01:20:20.107 --> 01:20:21.733
Go back and get her, Julio.

01:20:21.942 --> 01:20:23.067
Go back and get her.

01:20:23.360 --> 01:20:25.403
I must've been nuts to do this for...

01:20:25.613 --> 01:20:27.405
Oh, look who's here.

01:20:27.615 --> 01:20:30.200
I want her back, man. She's mine.

01:20:30.409 --> 01:20:32.285
Put that thing away.
You'll hurt yourself, will ya.

01:20:32.495 --> 01:20:33.912
Look, I'm in no mood for you.

01:20:34.079 --> 01:20:35.705
In fact, there is no mood for you.

01:20:44.924 --> 01:20:47.509
Nurse! Where is she?

01:20:48.010 --> 01:20:50.053
They're never here when you need 'em.

01:20:53.891 --> 01:20:55.850
Boy, oh, boy.

01:20:57.102 --> 01:21:00.313
Oh, nurse, you're here.
Where were you, huh?

01:21:00.523 --> 01:21:02.899
Three hundred and fifty
bucks a day, where are ya?

01:21:03.442 --> 01:21:04.400
Where are ya?

01:21:05.444 --> 01:21:08.363
Look at this. I'm dying of thirst here.

01:21:09.031 --> 01:21:09.781
Hey, how ya doin'?

01:21:09.990 --> 01:21:11.825
I heard about your unfortunate incident.

01:21:12.034 --> 01:21:13.785
Where were you when I needed you?

01:21:14.537 --> 01:21:16.287
I came to make up. I'm sorry.

01:21:16.497 --> 01:21:19.332
All right, Nicky, we're friends.
We're friends, all right?

01:21:20.918 --> 01:21:22.877
It must be tough eatin', huh?

01:21:23.420 --> 01:21:26.381
Eatin'. You should see me
go to the bathroom.

01:21:27.049 --> 01:21:31.344
- Monty! Hi, Nicky. We're back.
- Rose, you're here.

01:21:31.554 --> 01:21:36.349
How's our patient today?
Oh, he looks much better.

01:21:36.559 --> 01:21:37.600
How did you sleep?

01:21:37.810 --> 01:21:39.853
Are you kiddin'? I was up all night.

01:21:40.062 --> 01:21:42.188
Well, let's look at the chart.

01:21:43.065 --> 01:21:46.359
He was hit in the fleshy
area of the gluteus maximus.

01:21:46.569 --> 01:21:48.862
Ah, you're wrong. He got me in the ass.

01:21:49.071 --> 01:21:51.865
No vital areas were damaged.

01:21:52.074 --> 01:21:55.243
- No doubt he'll recover.
- How long do I have to be here?

01:21:55.452 --> 01:21:58.913
Let me see now. Perhaps we
might have to keep you here

01:21:59.123 --> 01:22:02.417
for four, maybe five weeks.

01:22:02.960 --> 01:22:04.878
Rose, I'm not hangin'
here for five weeks.

01:22:05.087 --> 01:22:06.880
At least I know you're
gonna be all right.

01:22:07.089 --> 01:22:09.257
I gotta pick up my mother
at the beauty parlor, all right.

01:22:09.466 --> 01:22:10.884
So long, Nicky.

01:22:14.305 --> 01:22:16.180
How are you feeling today?

01:22:16.932 --> 01:22:18.433
You're looking good.

01:22:21.228 --> 01:22:23.354
Oh, daddy!

01:22:25.024 --> 01:22:28.234
I never realized how
much Julio loved me.

01:22:29.111 --> 01:22:32.906
It was the most romantic
moment of my life

01:22:33.115 --> 01:22:35.783
when he almost killed you.

01:22:36.744 --> 01:22:38.912
Can I call you "dad" now?

01:22:39.872 --> 01:22:41.080
Take it easy!

01:22:41.290 --> 01:22:43.625
These are new stitches, you know.

01:22:44.168 --> 01:22:46.127
Why can't you forgive and forget?

01:22:46.337 --> 01:22:49.631
How could I forget?
Every time I sit down, I'll think of him.

01:22:49.840 --> 01:22:51.799
Monty, how are you?

01:22:52.343 --> 01:22:55.219
What an insensitive question.
You've been shot.

01:22:55.429 --> 01:22:58.097
Well, this'll cheer you up. We're a hit.

01:22:58.307 --> 01:23:00.600
What are you talking about?
They all laughed at me.

01:23:00.809 --> 01:23:03.603
But we're laughing now,
all the way to my bank.

01:23:03.812 --> 01:23:05.688
Look at this. What?

01:23:07.733 --> 01:23:10.652
We put the clothes in the window,
and the kids went crazy for it.

01:23:10.861 --> 01:23:14.155
I don't understand it,
but, well, who cares?

01:23:14.365 --> 01:23:16.658
The regular guy look is a big success.

01:23:16.867 --> 01:23:18.326
You did the regular guy look?

01:23:18.535 --> 01:23:21.120
I just bought two of your
short-sleeve pajama tops.

01:23:21.330 --> 01:23:25.124
- Rose, I gotta get out of here.
- Daddy, this is great!

01:23:25.334 --> 01:23:28.628
By the time you get out of the hospital,
we'll have the money.

01:23:28.837 --> 01:23:30.630
And you'll lose weight too.

01:23:30.839 --> 01:23:34.634
I saw the food. Monty, she's right.
Your ship's come in.

01:23:34.843 --> 01:23:37.053
But my pier collapsed.

01:23:37.846 --> 01:23:40.640
All right, everyone out.
Visiting hours are over. Please!

01:23:40.849 --> 01:23:44.227
We have sick men in here.
You too, doctor. Please.

01:23:44.770 --> 01:23:47.130
Excuse me, the two of you.

01:23:47.456 --> 01:23:50.650
This is a hospital.
Hey, come on, let's go.

01:23:52.897 --> 01:23:55.697
My good... Excuse me.
Will you get out? Let's go, let's go!

01:23:55.906 --> 01:23:56.864
Daddy!

01:23:57.408 --> 01:23:59.742
- How are you, Mr. Manucci?
- Bye, Monty.

01:24:00.285 --> 01:24:01.953
Martha's gonna take
good care of you today.

01:24:02.162 --> 01:24:03.663
How was your lunch?

01:24:03.872 --> 01:24:07.000
I see you haven't eaten much of it.
I don't blame you, honey.

01:24:07.209 --> 01:24:08.376
They're trying to make
everybody up here sicker...

01:24:08.585 --> 01:24:11.129
While I'm up here, check my oil.

01:24:32.693 --> 01:24:33.651
Jesus.

01:24:33.861 --> 01:24:36.279
We trust you had a pleasant swim, sir.

01:24:36.488 --> 01:24:37.196
Your shirt.

01:24:37.406 --> 01:24:39.115
I don't want that shirt.
Are you kiddin'?

01:24:39.324 --> 01:24:41.159
But sir, you should be
dressed to your station.

01:24:41.368 --> 01:24:42.827
I don't want to wear
that shirt, all right!

01:24:44.955 --> 01:24:48.916
Yes? This is Mr. Capuletti's
business advisor.

01:24:49.460 --> 01:24:53.421
What can I do for you?
Better yet, what can you do for me?

01:24:54.548 --> 01:24:55.590
Silver is down?

01:24:55.799 --> 01:24:58.548
Call the Lone Ranger.
He'll cheer him up.

01:25:00.304 --> 01:25:01.846
Hello.

01:25:02.056 --> 01:25:04.432
Oil wells? Very interesting.

01:25:06.518 --> 01:25:08.936
Meatballs, sir? No.

01:25:12.107 --> 01:25:14.067
- Madam?
- No.

01:25:20.032 --> 01:25:22.325
Meatball, sir?

01:25:23.118 --> 01:25:24.327
Where's the pistachio nuts?

01:25:24.536 --> 01:25:26.370
There's too much trouble
with the shells.

01:25:26.580 --> 01:25:29.373
Oh, yeah? I like the shells.

01:25:29.583 --> 01:25:31.459
Hmm.

01:25:35.005 --> 01:25:37.423
You got any salami or provolone?

01:25:38.092 --> 01:25:40.468
Salami, salami. Provolone.

01:25:40.677 --> 01:25:41.886
Give it to him.

01:25:43.013 --> 01:25:45.389
Why don't you get some sun
and come back next week?

01:25:46.100 --> 01:25:48.059
Julio?

01:25:49.019 --> 01:25:50.603
Julio?

01:25:53.524 --> 01:25:55.316
Julio.

01:25:57.027 --> 01:25:59.028
Julio.

01:25:59.655 --> 01:26:04.450
Oh, you bad boy.
You were hiding from me.

01:26:04.660 --> 01:26:06.994
- No.
- I found you now.

01:26:08.038 --> 01:26:10.915
- You gonna play with me?
- Not again.

01:26:11.125 --> 01:26:14.919
- Look what I wore just for you.
- Allison, I'm exhausted.

01:26:15.129 --> 01:26:16.921
Chapter six, "El Joyo."

01:26:17.131 --> 01:26:19.924
- You hired a captain?
- Yep. Everything's taken care of.

01:26:20.134 --> 01:26:23.427
- He know how to get to Coney Island?
- Yeah, I told him. It's easy.

01:26:24.388 --> 01:26:26.013
Here, I'll show you.

01:26:31.562 --> 01:26:34.981
You go north up the Atlantic,
west into the Hudson.

01:26:35.190 --> 01:26:37.483
Come to the statue of that
broad, you hang a right.

01:26:37.693 --> 01:26:40.486
Takes 20 minutes,
a half hour with traffic.

01:26:41.196 --> 01:26:44.365
Tell him to shove off as soon as I
sign those papers with Scrappleton.

01:26:47.098 --> 01:26:48.494
What's that, a fire drill?

01:26:48.704 --> 01:26:52.248
- It's lunch. Come on.
- I'm starving. Let's go.

01:26:57.588 --> 01:27:00.423
Oh, daddy, I just saw
the cutest little dingy.

01:27:00.966 --> 01:27:03.176
Allison, you're married to Julio.

01:27:04.636 --> 01:27:05.887
This is the life, huh?

01:27:06.096 --> 01:27:08.347
And they say money can't buy happiness.

01:27:08.557 --> 01:27:10.933
At least you can pick
your own kind of misery.

01:27:12.978 --> 01:27:15.855
Clive, you're the only one
who hasn't seen my stitches.

01:27:16.064 --> 01:27:17.440
Want to take a look?

01:27:32.873 --> 01:27:34.540
Excuse me.

01:27:36.960 --> 01:27:39.629
Mr. Daniel Scrappleton, sir.

01:27:39.838 --> 01:27:42.632
Hey, Scrappy, show me
that dotted line, huh?

01:27:42.841 --> 01:27:45.134
And Mrs. Kathleen Monahan.

01:27:46.345 --> 01:27:48.221
Oh, no!

01:27:50.307 --> 01:27:51.724
My god! It's mother.

01:27:51.934 --> 01:27:55.061
She's back from the dead.
She's better than Houdini.

01:27:55.270 --> 01:27:57.647
I've never felt better in my life!

01:27:57.856 --> 01:27:59.565
Grandma, did you bring me anything?

01:27:59.775 --> 01:28:01.150
A hat just like mine.

01:28:01.401 --> 01:28:04.570
You never felt better?
You were in a plane crash.

01:28:04.780 --> 01:28:07.698
- There was no crash.
- I made up the whole thing.

01:28:07.908 --> 01:28:08.866
Why?

01:28:09.076 --> 01:28:11.702
Rose, I did it for you
and the grandchildren.

01:28:11.912 --> 01:28:15.039
Someone had to stop Monty's debauchery.

01:28:15.249 --> 01:28:17.166
He was going to hell in a hand basket.

01:28:17.376 --> 01:28:18.167
Yes, quite true.

01:28:18.377 --> 01:28:20.169
- And to test you as well.
- You failed!

01:28:20.379 --> 01:28:23.172
- I'll kill her. I'll kill her!
- Take it easy.

01:28:23.382 --> 01:28:25.258
I'll kill her! I'll kill her!

01:28:25.801 --> 01:28:27.260
I'll kill her! Let me go!

01:28:28.720 --> 01:28:31.055
Boy, you got some
nerve still being alive.

01:28:31.640 --> 01:28:33.557
I went through this
whole thing for nothin'?

01:28:33.767 --> 01:28:38.646
No, not for nothing, Monty.
You proved yourself to me.

01:28:40.691 --> 01:28:44.110
And to make sure that you stay
on the straight and narrow,

01:28:44.319 --> 01:28:47.196
I'm moving in with you.

01:29:05.215 --> 01:29:08.092
- What's for dessert?
- Spumoni, miss.

01:29:08.719 --> 01:29:10.594
Your favorite, Monty.

01:29:10.804 --> 01:29:14.098
Shrimpton, none for Mr. Capuletti.

01:29:14.308 --> 01:29:16.600
- Right, mom.
- And Shrimpton.

01:29:16.810 --> 01:29:19.145
Mr. Capuletti is
skipping the coffee too.

01:29:19.354 --> 01:29:21.689
It'll keep me awake, right, mom?

01:29:21.898 --> 01:29:23.024
Right, dear.

01:29:23.233 --> 01:29:27.653
And Shrimpton, I noticed a bottle
of beer in the refrigerator.

01:29:27.863 --> 01:29:30.448
- Get rid of it.
- Tsk, tsk, tsk.

01:29:31.533 --> 01:29:33.034
Right again, mom.

01:29:34.286 --> 01:29:37.121
Well, I guess that's it for me.

01:29:37.331 --> 01:29:41.208
I think I'll go out and walk
off all these vegetables.

01:29:41.752 --> 01:29:46.213
And after that it's bedtime.

01:29:47.257 --> 01:29:49.759
- Good night, honey.
- Good night, sweetheart.

01:29:51.261 --> 01:29:53.637
- And Shrimpton?
- Yes, sir.

01:29:53.847 --> 01:29:56.640
You better get rid of that
glazed fruit too. It's fattening.

01:29:56.850 --> 01:29:58.517
Certainly, sir.

01:30:00.020 --> 01:30:02.688
- Good night, Belinda.
- Good night, daddy.

01:30:04.274 --> 01:30:05.649
Good night, mom.

01:30:08.320 --> 01:30:12.782
Hey, mom. That perfume
is driving me crazy.

01:30:14.826 --> 01:30:17.745
I think I married Rose
to get to you, huh?

01:30:24.294 --> 01:30:26.253
Good night, all.

01:30:28.507 --> 01:30:32.218
Rose, he's a changed man.

01:30:32.427 --> 01:30:37.098
- Finally, you've got a good marriage.
- We had a good marriage before.

01:30:37.307 --> 01:30:41.310
Yes, but now you're married
to a human being.

01:30:41.937 --> 01:30:45.731
I don't mind telling you,
I'm proud of what I did.

01:30:46.441 --> 01:30:48.234
It wasn't easy,

01:30:48.443 --> 01:30:51.904
but now I've got him under control!

01:30:52.864 --> 01:30:54.657
Where's the pizza? I'm starving!

01:30:54.866 --> 01:30:57.701
- Monty, where you been?
- We're keeping it warm for you.

01:30:58.870 --> 01:31:01.580
Wait a minute.
Don't get grease on the cards.

01:31:03.834 --> 01:31:05.793
Gimme the red pepper, will you?

01:31:07.337 --> 01:31:08.754
Gimme a napkin.

01:31:08.964 --> 01:31:11.799
- So what'd you tell her tonight?
- Tonight?

01:31:12.342 --> 01:31:15.305
I told her her perfume
is driving me crazy.

01:31:16.847 --> 01:31:20.808
Then I told her I married
Rose to get to her.

01:31:22.894 --> 01:31:24.770
Gimme a beer.

01:31:24.980 --> 01:31:27.982
My mother-in-law.
For years I wouldn't kiss her face,

01:31:28.191 --> 01:31:30.511
I ended up kissin' her ass.

01:31:31.305 --> 01:31:37.311
