WEBVTT

00:10.200 --> 00:12.067
>>> TOSH.0 FEATURES VIDEOS FROM

00:12.067 --> 00:14.333
THE INTERNET THAT IS INTENDED

00:14.333 --> 00:16.200
FOR A MATURE AUDIENCE.

00:16.200 --> 00:19.933
COMEDY CENTRAL DOES NOT CONDONE

00:19.933 --> 00:20.667
THE ACTIVITIES PERFORMED AND

00:20.667 --> 00:21.333
DISCOURAGES ANYONE FROM

00:21.333 --> 00:21.833
ATTEMPTING THEM.

00:21.833 --> 00:26.933
ENJOY!

00:48.467 --> 00:52.667
*

00:52.667 --> 00:54.433
>>> I WANTED TO TRY THAT!

00:54.433 --> 00:55.333
BUT WE DIDN'T HAVE THE BUDGET

00:55.333 --> 00:58.733
FOR A WRECKING BALL.

00:59.400 --> 01:01.833
WELCOME TO TOSH.0.

01:01.833 --> 01:04.600
ATHLEISURE FOR OUR PLEASURE.

01:04.600 --> 01:05.400
DROP CROTCH SHORTS.

01:05.400 --> 01:05.867
IT'S A THING.

01:05.867 --> 01:08.467
I WOULD ASK THE CAMERAWOMAN FOR

01:08.467 --> 01:09.900
A CLOSE-UP, BUT THERE ARE UNION

01:09.900 --> 01:11.900
RULES AGAINST THAT NOW.

01:11.900 --> 01:13.067
TONIGHT I EARNED ISSUE OF MY

01:13.067 --> 01:14.067
RIDE OR CRY CHICK.

01:14.067 --> 01:15.667
I BRING A BUTTER KNIFE TO A

01:15.667 --> 01:17.133
KNIFE FIGHT, AND WE ALL WORK ON

01:17.133 --> 01:19.200
OUR PRONUNCIATION.

01:19.200 --> 01:23.100
NOW, BACK TO WHAT MADE TOSH.0

01:23.100 --> 01:25.667
THE INSTITUTION IT IS TODAY.

01:25.667 --> 01:26.767
NUDITY ENFORCED PERSPECTIVE.

01:26.767 --> 01:29.067
EITHER THE BOWTIE IS HUGE OR

01:29.067 --> 01:31.267
HE'S TINY.

01:31.267 --> 01:33.300
I PERSONALLY FIND IT RACIST TO

01:33.300 --> 01:36.467
REFER TO AN ASIAN MAN'S PENIS AS

01:36.467 --> 01:38.567
HIS WANG.

01:39.067 --> 01:41.533
IS THIS THAT MOVIE, "THE

01:41.533 --> 01:43.067
GREATEST SHOWMAN?"

01:43.067 --> 01:44.267
YOU ARE GETTING HORNEY.

01:44.267 --> 01:47.133
VERY HORNEY.

01:47.133 --> 01:47.533
IT WORKED!

01:47.967 --> 01:49.400
REMINDS ME OF THE GRANDFATHER

01:49.400 --> 01:50.467
CLOCK IN MY OFFICE.

01:50.467 --> 01:52.333
IT'S A FAMILY HEIRLOOM.

01:52.333 --> 01:54.267
WHAT TIME IS IT, GRANDFATHER?

01:54.267 --> 01:57.900
>> IT'S TEN MINUTES UNTIL "WHEEL

01:57.900 --> 01:59.400
OF FORTUNE!"

01:59.400 --> 02:00.333
>> I CANNOT WAIT FOR THAT CLOCK

02:00.333 --> 02:02.333
TO DIE.

02:02.767 --> 02:06.067
IT JUST TAKES UP SO MUCH OFFICE

02:06.067 --> 02:06.400
SPACE.

02:06.400 --> 02:07.667
AND IT PHYSICALLY ABUSED MY

02:07.667 --> 02:08.067
HAND.

02:08.067 --> 02:08.467
ALL RIGHT.

02:08.467 --> 02:09.567
DID YOU KNOW ELEPHANT

02:09.567 --> 02:10.767
PREGNANCIES LAST 22 MONTHS?

02:10.767 --> 02:12.867
>> Audience: OH!

02:12.867 --> 02:14.433
>> DO YOU STILL HAVE TO BUY A

02:14.433 --> 02:16.067
PUSH PRESENT WHEN IT JUST DUMPS

02:16.067 --> 02:18.633
OUT OF HER VAGINA?

02:18.633 --> 02:20.733
YOU'RE GOING TO WISH THAT SAFARI

02:20.733 --> 02:23.333
VAN HAD A ROOF ON WHEN THAT

02:23.333 --> 02:25.400
WOOLLY MAMMOTH SMELL HITS YOU.

02:28.667 --> 02:30.633
COULD ONE OF YOU ELEPHANTS

02:30.633 --> 02:32.400
PLEASE STEP ON THAT GUT BUNGY?

02:32.400 --> 02:33.167
SHARPEN A TUSK AND SLICE OFF THE

02:33.167 --> 02:35.100
FORESKIN.

02:35.100 --> 02:35.867
THEY'RE PROTECTING IT FROM DON

02:35.867 --> 02:37.700
JR.

02:37.700 --> 02:38.400
SAY WHAT YOU WILL ABOUT HIS

02:38.400 --> 02:40.833
FATHER.

02:40.833 --> 02:43.867
THAT SON IS A PIECE OF SHIT.

02:44.300 --> 02:44.967
LOOK AT THOSE REPUBLICAN

02:44.967 --> 02:46.533
ELEPHANTS, CELEBRATING LIFE.

02:46.533 --> 02:48.067
MEANWHILE, THE DEMOCRATIC

02:48.067 --> 02:48.833
DONKEYS ARE KILLING THEIR UNBORN

02:48.833 --> 02:57.467
CHILDREN.

02:57.467 --> 02:58.500
>> SNOWFLAKE, THE ABORTIONIST

02:58.500 --> 03:00.667
WILL SEE YOU NOW.

03:03.267 --> 03:03.967
>> YOU KNOW THEY SELL THESE

03:03.967 --> 03:06.400
DONKEY FEET AS PARKED IN AN

03:06.400 --> 03:07.433
ARBY'S PARKING LOT.

03:07.433 --> 03:10.067
I SAW IT ON FOX NEWS.

03:10.067 --> 03:12.133
THIS NEXT KID'S MOVE IS TO

03:12.133 --> 03:12.833
IMPRISON GIRLS WITH HIS ICY

03:12.833 --> 03:16.333
STARE AND NEVER LET GO.

03:16.333 --> 03:17.900
IT'S CALLED THE AZIZ ANSARI.

03:19.467 --> 03:21.533
THE KID CAN DANCE!

03:21.533 --> 03:22.300
BUT YOU NEVER WANT TO HOME IN ON

03:22.300 --> 03:22.933
JUST ONE GIRL TO PARTY.

03:22.933 --> 03:25.200
ROOKIE!

03:25.200 --> 03:25.967
THE VIDEO THAT MATT DAMON PRAYED

03:25.967 --> 03:28.867

03:28.867 --> 03:29.633
GET THIS MANIAC A CLEAR BACKPACK

03:29.633 --> 03:33.567
IMMEDIATELY.

03:33.567 --> 03:34.600
HE WON'T KNOW HE'S A GHOST UNTIL

03:34.600 --> 03:35.667
HE TRIES TO EAT SOME OF THAT

03:35.667 --> 03:38.767
PIPING HOT DELICIOUS DOMINOES.

03:38.767 --> 03:39.533
THAT'S WHY SHE COULDN'T SEE HIM.

03:39.533 --> 03:42.933
MOVING ON.

03:42.933 --> 03:43.700
IS THIS THE NEW TESLA EVERYONE

03:43.700 --> 03:47.633
IS ON A WAITING LIST FOR?

03:47.633 --> 03:48.167
OKAY.

03:48.167 --> 03:52.067
THIS HAS TO BE HOW THE CELTICS

03:52.067 --> 03:55.867
FEEL GOING INTO THE PLAYOFFS.

03:55.867 --> 03:57.967
TURNS OUT THE STEERING WHEEL IS

03:57.967 --> 03:58.700
REALLY USELESS ONCE YOU'RE IN

03:58.700 --> 04:01.667

AH, HE 9/11ED IT.

04:03.767 --> 04:05.333

04:38.133 --> 04:40.500
NAKED STRIPPER CAT FIGHT SOUNDED

04:58.733 --> 05:00.933
DISGUSTING TAMPA OR EVEN GROSSER

05:01.500 --> 05:03.267
IT'S THE SHOW GIRLS SHOWDOWN.

05:03.267 --> 05:04.500
THE THRILLER THAT SMELLS LIKE

05:04.500 --> 05:06.700
VANILLA.

05:06.700 --> 05:08.067
THEY'RE FIGHTING OVER WHETHER

05:08.067 --> 05:09.400
IT'S A GOOD IDEA TO PULL OUR

05:09.400 --> 05:11.133
TRIPS OUT OF SYRIA.

05:11.133 --> 05:11.867
OR SOMETHING TO DO WITH BODY

05:11.867 --> 05:12.233
GLITTER.

05:16.867 --> 05:17.900
NONE OF THEM HAD FATHERS GROWING

05:17.900 --> 05:20.967
UP TO FORCE THEM TO CLEAN THEIR

05:20.967 --> 05:21.300

05:21.300 --> 05:22.500
OH, WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.

05:26.333 --> 05:27.700
I LIKE MY BUTT SQUARED OFF WITH

05:27.700 --> 05:30.533
HARD EDGES.

05:30.533 --> 05:32.133
I ALSO LIKE THAT WE HAVE TO

05:32.133 --> 05:35.833
BLUR THEIR FACES, BUT NOT THEIR

05:35.833 --> 05:37.333
BUTT HOLES.

05:50.167 --> 05:51.867
SERIOUSLY INJURED, SEVERAL ARE

05:51.867 --> 05:53.467
PRETENDING TO GO TO NURSING

05:53.467 --> 05:53.833
SCHOOL.

05:53.833 --> 05:55.533
I'M NOT GOING TO SUGAR COAT IT.

05:55.533 --> 05:56.467
THIS IS SAD.

05:56.467 --> 05:57.933
NOW GET BACK UP ON THE POLE.

05:57.933 --> 05:58.867
THAT DODGE CHALLENGER ISN'T

05:58.867 --> 06:00.233
GOING TO PAY FOR ITSELF.

06:00.233 --> 06:02.367

06:04.700 --> 06:07.600
INSTALLMENT OF "HEY BOSS," AND

06:07.600 --> 06:10.300
HEY BOSS, PLEASE IGNORE THE

06:10.300 --> 06:13.133
SCREAMING WOMAN IN THE

06:13.133 --> 06:13.567
BACKGROUND.

06:13.567 --> 06:14.333
SHE'S DEFINITELY NOT SCREAMING

06:14.333 --> 06:15.633
BECAUSE I DROPPED A LARGE BRIDGE

06:15.633 --> 06:19.067
ON A RESTAURANT FULL OF PEOPLE.

06:19.067 --> 06:19.400
UNRELATED.

06:19.400 --> 06:20.167
DID WE GET THAT RENTAL INSURANCE

06:20.167 --> 06:20.633

06:37.467 --> 06:39.733

07:10.600 --> 07:14.267
>> THAT IDIOT COP!

07:17.167 --> 07:17.500

07:21.733 --> 07:23.067
OWE MY FRIEND'S MOM $80 AND I

07:23.067 --> 07:25.100
CAN'T GET A JOB NOW.

07:25.100 --> 07:26.467
I'M GAY AND MY PARENTS ARE

07:26.467 --> 07:27.867
REALLY MAD AT ME.

07:27.867 --> 07:30.867
AND I'M GOING TO HELL.

07:30.867 --> 07:34.767
SO IF ANYONE

07:34.767 --> 07:37.067
PLUS MY LIFE IS EXTREMELY GOING

07:37.067 --> 07:39.600
DOWNHILL BECAUSE I'M GETTING

07:43.333 --> 07:44.067

07:44.900 --> 07:46.867
MONEY, ACNE, BALDING.

WHILE YOU'RE LISTING YOUR

07:48.867 --> 07:51.500
PROBLEMS, TACK ON UGLY CRY FACE.

07:51.500 --> 07:53.400
THE GIRL STUCK IN THE EMOTIONAL

07:53.400 --> 07:57.567
TRAFFIC JAM IS AMY, AND SHE

07:57.567 --> 07:59.100
FILMED IT BECAUSE SHE

07:59.100 --> 08:00.233
IMMEDIATELY OVERSHARES

08:00.233 --> 08:00.667
EVERYTHING.

08:00.667 --> 08:03.300
SHE GOT A TICKET BECAUSE SHE

08:03.300 --> 08:04.067
FAILED TO GET IN THE FAR LANE

08:04.067 --> 08:06.367
WHEN PASSING A POLICE OFFICER

08:06.367 --> 08:07.167
WHO WAS LEANING HIS FAT ASS, HER

08:07.167 --> 08:09.800
WORDS, INTO TRAFFIC.

08:09.800 --> 08:11.800
AND SHOULD BE CRYING TEARS OF

08:11.800 --> 08:12.100
JOY.

08:12.100 --> 08:14.200
IF SHE WEREN'T TO WHITE THAT

08:14.200 --> 08:16.267
FAST ASS INDIANA COP, AGAIN, HER

08:18.767 --> 08:21.333
I WON'T EVEN DRIVE WITH A

08:21.333 --> 08:21.700
SUNTAN.

08:21.700 --> 08:23.700
GETTING PULLED OVER IS NO FUN.

08:23.700 --> 08:25.800
YOU HAVE TO LISTEN TO THE

08:25.800 --> 08:28.200
OFFICER GUSH ABOUT WHAT A HUGE

08:28.200 --> 08:29.700
FAN HE IS AND SMILE FOR A

08:29.700 --> 08:30.067
SELFIE.

08:30.067 --> 08:30.500
IT'S AWFUL.

08:30.500 --> 08:31.867
COPS DON'T WANT TO GIVE YOU A

08:31.867 --> 08:32.233
TICKET.

08:32.233 --> 08:34.367
WRITING IS NOT THEIR STRONG

08:34.367 --> 08:34.700
SUIT.

08:34.700 --> 08:37.100
IT'S WEIRD THAT THEY STILL FILL

08:37.100 --> 08:37.833
IT OUT LONG HAND.

08:37.833 --> 08:41.400
TEXT IT TO ME, GRANDPA, I'LL VIN

08:45.400 --> 08:46.067
GET ON WITH OUR LIVES.

08:46.067 --> 08:47.267
TEXTING WHILE DRIVING IS ILLEGAL

08:47.267 --> 08:48.933
BUT IF YOU INCLUDE A PICTURE OF

08:48.933 --> 08:55.667
YOUR GENITALS, IT'S SEXTING

08:55.667 --> 08:57.167
WHILE DRIVING.

08:57.167 --> 08:58.067
SOMEDAY, YOU'LL LOOK BACK ON

08:58.067 --> 08:59.367
THIS AND JUST LAUGH AND LAUGH

08:59.367 --> 09:00.167

09:00.167 --> 09:02.267

09:02.267 --> 09:03.533
IN TO SEDATE HERE.

09:03.533 --> 09:05.333
THAT'S WHY I HAD HER DRIVE ON A

09:29.367 --> 09:30.067
SHOULDN'T BE IN THE STREET

09:30.067 --> 09:30.433

10:38.633 --> 10:39.433
I'VE ALWAYS WANTED THIS SHOW TO

10:39.433 --> 10:39.900
HAVE AN EMMY.

10:39.900 --> 10:42.000
WHERE ARE YOU FROM?

10:42.000 --> 10:42.700

10:42.700 --> 10:44.200

10:47.867 --> 10:48.767
OBVIOUSLY DIDN'T THINK THAT WAS

10:48.767 --> 10:52.100
GOING TO HAPPEN.

10:52.100 --> 10:53.767
>> I CAN'T GO INTO DEBT RIGHT

10:53.767 --> 10:54.067
NOW.

10:54.067 --> 10:55.200

10:55.200 --> 10:57.367
PEOPLE WERE GOING TO SEE IT AND

10:57.367 --> 10:58.367
I WAS EMBARRASSED.

10:58.367 --> 11:01.067
AND THEN I WAS LIKE, IT'S FINE

11:01.067 --> 11:02.267
BECAUSE EVERYONE THOUGHT IT WAS

11:02.267 --> 11:03.367
FUNNY SO IT'S OKAY.

11:03.367 --> 11:04.333
>> IT IS FUNNY.

11:15.133 --> 11:16.867
TAKING CARE OF THEIR BUSINESS

11:16.867 --> 11:17.867
AND I JUST PASSED THEM.

11:17.867 --> 11:19.067
I DIDN'T KNOW YOU HAD TO SLOW

11:19.067 --> 11:20.400
DOWN, APPARENTLY, BECAUSE THE

11:20.400 --> 11:21.967
COP CAN GET HURT EVEN THOUGH

11:21.967 --> 11:23.133
HE'S IN HIS CAR.

11:24.600 --> 11:27.833
AND I WAS LIKE, OKAY, I'M

11:27.833 --> 11:29.067
GETTING PULLED OVER, AND I GET A

11:29.067 --> 11:32.300

11:32.300 --> 11:36.367
WOW, I'M GOING TO GET IN A LOT

11:36.367 --> 11:36.800

11:36.800 --> 11:37.600

11:37.600 --> 11:38.600
SO I SAID NO.

11:38.600 --> 11:40.267

11:40.267 --> 11:41.867
HAPPENED RECENTLY JUST STARTED

11:41.867 --> 11:42.633
GOING INTO MY BRAIN.

11:44.067 --> 11:46.367

11:48.267 --> 11:50.200
>> YOUR FRIENDS WEREN'T VERY

11:50.200 --> 11:50.667
SYMPATHETIC.

11:50.667 --> 11:52.667
>> MY FRIENDS ARE LAUGHING, AND

11:52.667 --> 11:54.133
I'M HAVING AN EMOTIONAL

11:54.133 --> 11:54.533

11:57.067 --> 11:58.467
GETTING MORE COMPASSIONATE

11:58.467 --> 11:58.833
FRIENDS?

11:58.833 --> 12:00.100
>> NO, BECAUSE I'M NOT

12:00.100 --> 12:00.667

12:07.500 --> 12:09.700
>> MY GOOD FRIEND, OWEN AND

12:09.700 --> 12:10.067
TAYLOR.

12:10.067 --> 12:13.733
>> IS OWEN GAY?

12:13.733 --> 12:14.200
>> YEAH.

12:14.200 --> 12:16.233
>> I BASE THAT OFF NOTHING,

12:16.233 --> 12:18.067
BECAUSE YOU SEEM LIKE A VERSION

12:18.067 --> 12:20.567

12:20.567 --> 12:22.300
INDIANA KIDS.

12:22.300 --> 12:24.067
>> WE WERE SEEING ALL-TIME LOW.

12:24.067 --> 12:27.067
>> YOU SING WHEN YOU CRY.

12:27.067 --> 12:28.067
IT'S LIKE --

12:28.067 --> 12:30.200
>> WHERE ARE YOU AT ON TIMMY T?

12:30.200 --> 12:31.633
>> I DON'T KNOW WHAT TIMMY T IS?

12:31.633 --> 12:32.433
>> TIMMY T?

12:32.433 --> 12:34.200
YOU LOOK UP TIMMY T.

12:34.200 --> 12:34.667
>> OKAY.

12:34.667 --> 12:35.233

12:35.233 --> 12:36.867
HE'S GOT ONE SONG, I THINK IT

12:36.867 --> 12:37.833

12:37.833 --> 12:38.833
>> I WASN'T ALIVE.

12:38.833 --> 12:40.600
>> NO, OF COURSE, YOU WEREN'T.

12:40.600 --> 12:42.467
BUT THE REASON YOU ARE ALIVE --

12:42.467 --> 12:42.833
TIMMY T.

12:42.833 --> 12:43.167
YEAH!

12:43.167 --> 12:44.467

12:44.467 --> 12:46.600
THE NOTE, THAT'S SO FUNNY,

12:46.600 --> 12:46.967

12:46.967 --> 12:48.333
>> AND MY PARENTS ARE REALLY MAD

12:48.333 --> 12:49.367
AT ME.

12:49.367 --> 12:50.500
AND I'M GOING TO --

12:50.500 --> 12:51.767
>> DO YOU DO THAT REGULARLY?

FRIENDS DO.

12:54.833 --> 12:55.700

12:55.700 --> 12:56.767
I JUST START SINGING.

12:56.767 --> 12:57.233
I DON'T KNOW.

12:57.233 --> 12:58.700
>> I HAVE NO ISSUE WITH IT.

12:58.700 --> 12:59.633
IT'S GREAT.

12:59.633 --> 13:01.233
LET'S TALK ABOUT THE FINANCIAL

13:01.233 --> 13:03.700
ASPECT OF YOUR VIDEO.

13:03.700 --> 13:06.067

13:08.167 --> 13:09.300

13:09.300 --> 13:10.900
BALANCE IN YOUR BANK ACCOUNT WAS

13:10.900 --> 13:11.733
BELOW $50.

13:11.733 --> 13:12.100
>> YEAH.

13:12.100 --> 13:13.900
>> DID THEY HIT YOU WITH THAT

13:13.900 --> 13:14.533

13:16.533 --> 13:19.133
YOUR BANK, OR IS $47 IN

13:19.133 --> 13:19.967
CLEVELAND CONSIDERED A LOT?

13:19.967 --> 13:21.633
BY THE WAY, YOUR SKIN HAS

13:21.633 --> 13:23.467

13:36.567 --> 13:36.967
ACCUTANE.

13:36.967 --> 13:38.400

13:42.600 --> 13:45.400
>> I THINK I HAVE A RECEDING

13:45.400 --> 13:45.800
HAIRLINE.

13:45.800 --> 13:49.067
>> YOU KNOW SHAVING YOUR HEAD IS

13:49.067 --> 13:50.633
THE BEST WAY TO KEEP YOUR BALD

13:50.633 --> 13:51.533
SPOT FROM SPREADING.

13:51.533 --> 13:52.600
>> IS THAT TRUE?

13:52.600 --> 13:53.100
>> MAYBE.

13:53.100 --> 13:56.900
THIS IS A SEVEN-HOUR CLOSE AND I

13:56.900 --> 13:57.467
HAVE HOURS TO KILL.

13:57.467 --> 14:02.067
WHO WANTS TO SEE ME SHAVE HER

14:02.067 --> 14:02.367
HEAD?

14:02.367 --> 14:03.567
>> DO YOU ALWAYS CARRY CLIPPERS?

14:03.567 --> 14:08.067
>> YES, BECAUSE IN MY OFF TIME

14:08.067 --> 14:09.333
I'M ACTUALLY A COMEDY MILITARY

14:09.333 --> 14:09.733
RECRUITER.

14:09.733 --> 14:12.200
THIS WILL MAKE YOU A BETTER

14:12.200 --> 14:13.067
DRIVER, BECAUSE WOMEN ARE ALWAYS

14:13.067 --> 14:13.667
DISTRACTED BY THEIR HAIR.

14:13.667 --> 14:14.433
NO BIG MOLE.

14:14.433 --> 14:16.233
I MEAN, IT WOULD BE BAD ASS IF I

14:16.233 --> 14:18.100
KEPT YOU WITH A MULLET.

14:18.100 --> 14:20.433
I THINK YOU'VE GOT A GOOD HEAD.

14:20.433 --> 14:20.967
I DON'T KNOW YET.

14:20.967 --> 14:21.967
WE HAVE A LOT TO GO.

14:21.967 --> 14:23.100
YOUR FIRST SHOWER IS GOING TO

14:23.100 --> 14:24.100
FEEL SO GOOD.

14:24.100 --> 14:24.833
>> I KNOW.

14:24.833 --> 14:25.300
I'M EXCITED.

14:25.300 --> 14:27.633
>> THAT PART IS LEGIT.

14:27.633 --> 14:29.067
DO YOU EVER LISTEN TO THE CURE?

14:29.067 --> 14:30.067
>> BY LADY GAGA?

14:30.067 --> 14:30.667
>> YEAH.

14:30.667 --> 14:32.967
OH, THERE'S THAT ONE LITTLE BALD

14:32.967 --> 14:34.233
SPOT YOU THOUGHT YOU HAD.

14:34.233 --> 14:35.067
I THINK YOU'RE GOING TO BE HAPPY

14:35.067 --> 14:37.333
WITH THIS, BUT MAYBE NOT.

14:37.333 --> 14:39.700
YOU MIGHT BE TERRIFIED.

14:39.700 --> 14:41.367
THERE'S A CLIMATE IN HOLLYWOOD

14:41.367 --> 14:43.133
WHERE RIGHT NOW I FEEL LIKE

14:43.133 --> 14:44.733
BLOWING ON YOUR NECK IS

14:44.733 --> 14:46.800
INAPPROPRIATE, SO I'M NOT GOING

14:46.800 --> 14:47.100
TO.

14:47.100 --> 14:48.267
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'RE SUPPOSED

14:48.267 --> 14:49.067
TO DO THIS.

14:49.067 --> 14:50.667
A LOT OF PEOPLE DO THAT, THEY

14:50.667 --> 14:54.600
SLAP YOUR HEAD.

14:54.600 --> 14:55.100
BARBERS DO THAT.

14:55.100 --> 14:55.933
WHY DO THEY DO THAT?

14:55.933 --> 14:58.600
BECAUSE YOU CAN, AND THEY DON'T

14:58.600 --> 14:59.700
GET ARRESTED.

14:59.700 --> 15:01.633
JUST GO ON THE LAM, BECAUSE NO

15:01.633 --> 15:02.700
ONE IS GOING TO RECOGNIZE YOU.

15:02.700 --> 15:03.267
>> THIS IS SO COOL!

15:03.267 --> 15:04.467
>> YOU LIKE THE LENGTH?

15:04.467 --> 15:05.867
>> I DO LIKE THE LENGTHS.

15:05.867 --> 15:07.600
>> IF YOU DON'T, YOU CAN ALWAYS

15:07.600 --> 15:08.167
JUST DO THIS.

15:09.367 --> 15:10.933
>> TWO WEEKS LATER, I DIDN'T

15:10.933 --> 15:12.500
FORCE HER TO SHAVE HER HEAD, SHE

15:12.500 --> 15:14.233
WANTED TO RAISE AWARENESS FOR

15:14.233 --> 15:15.100
St. BALDRICKS.

15:15.100 --> 15:16.200
NOW YOU ARE ALL AWARE.

15:16.200 --> 15:17.633
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

15:17.633 --> 15:20.067
FIRST, DRUNK DRIVING IS ILLEGAL.

15:20.067 --> 15:20.667
DRUNK PASSENGER IS JUST

15:20.667 --> 15:21.500
ANNOYING.

15:21.500 --> 15:23.067
>> HI THERE!

15:56.400 --> 15:56.767
>> YEAH.

15:56.767 --> 15:58.067
>> WHOA!

15:58.067 --> 16:00.267
>> SOMEBODY IS PREPARED FOR THE

16:00.267 --> 16:02.200
ASSAULT RIFLE BAN.

16:02.633 --> 16:04.600
I DON'T HAVE TO TELL YOU THIS,

16:04.600 --> 16:07.267
BUT THAT'S BLADE SPORTS WHERE

16:07.267 --> 16:10.833
EIGHT TO TEN PEOPLE SIT IN

ANYONE CAN WATCH A TRUE ATHLETE

16:18.633 --> 16:24.933
