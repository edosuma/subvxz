<i>What a party we got here, yeah!</i>

01:00.045 --> 01:01.603
<i>You're looking hot.</i>

01:07.686 --> 01:11.622
You can't believe it?
I'm telling you, this is the place to be.

01:12.024 --> 01:14.526
And we got four days here?
This is unbelievable.

01:14.626 --> 01:16.753
I'm dreaming. I'm dreaming.

01:17.863 --> 01:20.127
<i>Yeah, you're looking good, baby.</i>

01:20.265 --> 01:21.926
Oh, my God!

01:22.601 --> 01:24.626
<i>All right!</i>

01:28.073 --> 01:30.906
<i>Yeah, let me see what you can do, girl.</i>

<i>Oh, yeah.</i>

<i>Let me see you dance, people.</i>

01:52.064 --> 01:54.032
<i>Oh, yeah!</i>

02:03.141 --> 02:05.632
<i>Hey, girl, bring it to me, baby.</i>

02:06.612 --> 02:08.341
<i>Yeah, you got it.</i>

02:09.548 --> 02:12.415
<i>Give it to me now. Yeah, bring it on.</i>

02:14.519 --> 02:16.622
<i>No, no, no, no, no, no, baby.</i>

02:16.722 --> 02:17.950
It's fine.

02:18.924 --> 02:20.721
<i>Let me see you move.</i>

02:28.567 --> 02:33.004
<i>All right now.
Let me see you get your hands together.</i>

02:42.381 --> 02:43.780
<i>Look at that.</i>

02:46.952 --> 02:48.681
<i>All right.</i>

02:49.154 --> 02:51.145
<i>Move it, baby. Move it now.</i>

02:56.328 --> 02:58.956

<i>Yeah, you got it.</i>

03:02.768 --> 03:05.601
<i>Give it to me now. Yeah, bring it on.</i>

03:08.173 --> 03:11.301
<i>No, no, no, no, no, no, baby.</i>

03:12.945 --> 03:14.344
Watch this.

03:21.720 --> 03:26.157
<i>All right now.
Let me see you get your hands together.</i>

03:35.500 --> 03:36.899
<i>Look at that.</i>

03:39.004 --> 03:40.995
Oh, honey, meet Johnny.

03:44.309 --> 03:45.537
Hey!

03:54.653 --> 03:57.178
Gin and tonic. That'll be $6.50.

03:58.056 --> 03:59.250
$6.50?

03:59.358 --> 04:01.155
Can I help you guys?

04:01.426 --> 04:02.757
Two beers.

04:03.862 --> 04:05.130
Good thinking.

04:05.230 --> 04:06.754
- $12.
- Yeah.

04:11.703 --> 04:12.971
Gentlemen.

04:13.071 --> 04:17.098
This party is for resort guests only.

04:17.409 --> 04:19.536
You'll have to come with me.

04:20.278 --> 04:21.677
Absolutely.

04:26.485 --> 04:27.850
Excuse me.

04:28.920 --> 04:30.046
Geek!

04:33.658 --> 04:37.863
Hotel security.
And he takes his job very, very seriously.

04:37.963 --> 04:40.227
- I'd say so.
- I bet he does.

04:42.167 --> 04:45.370
Hey, Tony, I need two vodka tonics,
one white wine.

04:45.470 --> 04:47.233
And nine kamikazes.

04:48.006 --> 04:49.633
Okay, you got it?

04:53.845 --> 04:55.472
She's something.

04:55.947 --> 04:57.783
No way, man, she works here.

04:57.883 --> 05:01.216
Look around this place.
It's the Promised Land.

05:01.920 --> 05:05.048
We're gonna have an insane time,
I'm telling you.

05:42.527 --> 05:43.762
- Hey!
- Hey!

05:43.862 --> 05:45.831
I already warned you to stop doing that!

05:45.931 --> 05:47.330
Okay, okay.

05:51.136 --> 05:53.739
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,
but you ought to know by now.

05:53.839 --> 05:56.575
You're talking to me, the best.

05:56.675 --> 05:57.743
You know what they call me?

05:57.843 --> 05:59.778
<i>Yeah, yeah, listen to me. I'm sorry, okay?</i>

05:59.878 --> 06:01.480
What do they call me?

06:01.580 --> 06:02.814
<i>The Maestro.</i>

06:02.914 --> 06:06.850
That's right. The Maestro.
So don't worry. I always do the job.

06:08.053 --> 06:09.588
I'm watching the old broad right now.

06:09.688 --> 06:12.290
<i>I just don't want you wasting time
looking at tits.</i>

06:12.390 --> 06:15.394
I'm telling you for the last time.
I'm getting ready.

06:15.494 --> 06:17.496
Gonna give my hair a little trim,

06:17.596 --> 06:20.899
and then I'm gonna kiss that rock
off that old lady's throat.

06:20.999 --> 06:24.491
And if that doesn't work,
I'll rip it off, neck and all.

06:25.170 --> 06:26.872
Whatever it takes,
the rock's in your pocket.

06:26.972 --> 06:28.462
<i>It better be!</i>

06:32.744 --> 06:34.302
Very tough guy.

06:35.313 --> 06:37.213
Baby, did you find me the barber?

06:37.816 --> 06:40.152
He's in the room setting up right now.

06:40.252 --> 06:43.188
He expects to meet you
at 2:00 on the button.

06:43.288 --> 06:46.758
Good. How about another pink flamingo?

06:46.858 --> 06:48.223
All right.

06:50.762 --> 06:54.289
Watch the hair! Don't, no! Watch... Water!

07:14.586 --> 07:15.687
I'm so sorry.

07:15.787 --> 07:18.023
I wasn't watching where I was going.

07:18.123 --> 07:20.785
Oh, no problem. Happens here all the time.

07:23.328 --> 07:25.163
Patti, what are you doing to this guest?

07:25.263 --> 07:26.465
- Are you okay, sir?
- I'm okay.

07:26.565 --> 07:29.159
Look, she spilled something on you.
I'm sorry.

07:29.334 --> 07:32.303
- Apologize to the man.
- No, it's okay.

07:32.938 --> 07:34.269
I enjoyed it.

07:35.507 --> 07:37.532
I'll see you later. Okay?

07:38.510 --> 07:40.545
Stay away from the hotel guests.

07:40.645 --> 07:42.306
Especially jerks like that.

07:42.747 --> 07:44.476
It was an accident.

07:45.784 --> 07:47.953
You know, this should come out
of your paycheck.

07:48.053 --> 07:51.216
But I'm gonna let it go.
Only because I like you.

07:51.356 --> 07:53.051
Remember, you owe me one.

07:53.158 --> 07:57.686
Maybe we could get together tonight
after work. What do you say?

07:58.496 --> 07:59.827
We'll see.

08:08.406 --> 08:10.374
Hey. What are you doing, man?

08:11.643 --> 08:13.445
- See her?
- See who?

08:13.545 --> 08:15.706
The waitress. I'm in love.

08:16.381 --> 08:18.116
Come on, man, I told you.

08:18.216 --> 08:21.674
She's here to work. We're here to play.

08:25.590 --> 08:27.259
- Take a look at that.
- Hey, Edna.

08:27.359 --> 08:28.826
Look at this.

08:31.463 --> 08:33.488
Observe the master, okay?

08:41.905 --> 08:43.965
- Hi, Edna.
- Hi.

08:44.843 --> 08:48.847
Listen, I'd love to get to know your friend.
You know, if she's available.

08:48.947 --> 08:50.938
- What about it?
- Maybe.

08:51.783 --> 08:54.377
- Here, let me help you out.
- Sure.

08:55.253 --> 08:57.622
Hey, what, are you causing trouble again?

08:57.722 --> 09:01.055
No, I'm trying to give her...
Could you help me here?

09:01.226 --> 09:02.784
Hi. Hi, honey.

09:04.929 --> 09:06.487
Here you go, honey.

09:11.736 --> 09:13.704
Oh, heck!

09:19.844 --> 09:21.079
Georgie!

09:21.179 --> 09:23.281
Remember, you can't go swimming.
You just ate!

09:23.381 --> 09:24.712
Okay, Mom.

09:33.825 --> 09:34.985
Look at that!

09:37.429 --> 09:38.953
Wait a minute.

09:40.198 --> 09:41.426
George!

09:42.867 --> 09:44.436
Why don't you take a nice swim?

09:44.536 --> 09:47.096
Mommy says I can't. I'll get cramps.

09:48.106 --> 09:50.542
- Good.
- Hey, get off me! Get off!

09:50.642 --> 09:51.843
Get off me!

09:51.943 --> 09:53.911
Get off! Come on, no!

09:56.781 --> 09:59.150
I'm sorry. Were you sleeping?

09:59.250 --> 10:01.047
Well, I guess I was.

10:01.252 --> 10:03.822
But it's a good thing
you fellows woke me up.

10:03.922 --> 10:05.624
I think I'm getting a sunburn.

10:05.724 --> 10:07.817
You look a little red.

10:08.026 --> 10:11.630
Well, that always happens to gals
with skin like mine.

10:11.730 --> 10:14.198
Really? That happens to me, too.

10:14.466 --> 10:16.134
- No kidding.
- Yeah.

10:16.234 --> 10:20.261
Listen, I've got the best sunburn stuff
in the world.

10:20.605 --> 10:23.174
Why don't you come on up to the room?
I'll even help you put it on.

10:23.274 --> 10:24.909
Well, thanks a bunch, sugar,

10:25.009 --> 10:28.672
but I never go to strange men's rooms.

10:29.114 --> 10:30.448
Okay, I'll bring it to your room.

10:30.548 --> 10:33.449
Are you always this forward
with strangers?

10:34.085 --> 10:35.814
Only with beautiful women.

10:36.921 --> 10:39.617
Well, you're kind of cute yourself.

10:43.695 --> 10:46.892
With all these good looks in common,
we should get together.

10:47.298 --> 10:51.132
Sounds like fun,
but Bobbie Sue's gotta run.

10:52.637 --> 10:54.730
- Bye-bye.
- Bye.

10:55.273 --> 10:57.400
She loves us, she loves us.

11:00.912 --> 11:02.947
Hey, look, she forgot her key.

11:03.047 --> 11:05.277
- Excuse me, miss!
- No, no, no.

11:05.450 --> 11:06.484
- Wrong.
- What?

11:06.584 --> 11:08.320
She didn't forget her key.

11:08.420 --> 11:10.455
She left it for us, let's go.

11:10.555 --> 11:12.250
- You're crazy.
- Right now.

11:14.259 --> 11:16.693
Boy, I'd pay to see this.

11:35.980 --> 11:37.607
Fore!

11:38.817 --> 11:40.944
Oh, God!

11:47.124 --> 11:49.024
Hello! Is anybody home?

11:51.662 --> 11:55.063
Anybody home? She's not here.

11:58.202 --> 11:59.404
What are you doing?

11:59.504 --> 12:01.939
What am I doing?
What does it look like I'm doing?

12:02.039 --> 12:04.575
This babe's hot.
You think she brought us up here to talk?

12:04.675 --> 12:07.542
- You're nuts. I'm going.
- No, Ben! Don't leave.

12:07.678 --> 12:08.913
I'm telling you, when she gets here,

12:09.013 --> 12:12.813
she's not gonna wanna waste
a lot of time, you understand? Just relax.

12:14.452 --> 12:16.487
Are you sure she left the key for us?

12:16.587 --> 12:18.782
Of course she left it for us.
What do you think?

12:19.323 --> 12:21.291
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

12:22.326 --> 12:23.384
How do I look?

12:25.696 --> 12:26.764
Great.

12:26.864 --> 12:28.923
Really? That's great.

12:30.001 --> 12:34.165
That's her! You tell her I'm in here.
I'll be in the bedroom, okay?

12:51.923 --> 12:52.924
Hi.

12:53.024 --> 12:56.761
Hang this up, close the door.
Come on, let's get to work.

12:56.861 --> 12:58.529
- You're early.
- Early?

12:58.629 --> 13:00.790
- My wife tell you about my hair?
- Your wife?

13:01.165 --> 13:02.800
Well, you're the barber, aren't you?

13:02.900 --> 13:03.935
Barber?

13:04.035 --> 13:07.104
What, do I hear an echo here?
Are you the barber or not?

13:07.204 --> 13:08.339
Yeah, I'm the barber.

13:08.439 --> 13:10.942
All right. Well, let's go.
Let's cut the hair.

13:11.042 --> 13:12.743
This is a very important job.

13:12.843 --> 13:15.112
I don't want it to look
like I just had a haircut. All right?

13:15.212 --> 13:17.548
Just want a little trim from the side,
a little from the top.

13:17.648 --> 13:20.310
Hey, come on,
put the cloth on me, come on.

13:20.751 --> 13:23.982
Come on, let's go, let's go.
I don't have all day.

13:24.121 --> 13:25.756
- How long you been doing this?
- Not long.

13:25.856 --> 13:26.982
What?

13:27.191 --> 13:29.460
At this hotel. Not long at this hotel.

13:29.560 --> 13:32.930
My hair is very, very important to me,
do you understand?

13:33.030 --> 13:34.065
All right.

13:34.165 --> 13:36.000
- I don't want you to experiment or anything.
- No. No.

13:36.100 --> 13:37.902
I want you to be very, very careful here.

13:38.002 --> 13:39.637
Just a little bit off the side,

13:39.737 --> 13:41.138
- a little bit from the back.
- Yeah.

13:41.238 --> 13:44.742
Make sure it's very, very even
down the back of my neck, all right?

13:44.842 --> 13:47.174
Just be careful. Take your time.

13:49.847 --> 13:53.180
Give me that phone,
come on, give me the phone, kid.

13:55.987 --> 13:57.716
Give me that phone.

13:58.689 --> 14:00.316
Hello. Yeah.

14:00.691 --> 14:01.993
Listen, do you want me to kill her?

14:02.093 --> 14:05.187
All right, I'll kill her.
I'll get the rock. But don't bother me!

14:06.163 --> 14:08.154
Now look, I'd... Hello?

14:09.367 --> 14:12.928
Hello? Hello? Get the door. Get the door.

14:13.170 --> 14:14.967
Now give me a bourbon, kid.

14:15.239 --> 14:17.341
Come on, I don't need this job.

14:17.441 --> 14:19.644
Can you imagine that?
The guy hung up on me.

14:19.744 --> 14:20.972
Thanks.

14:21.612 --> 14:23.514
That must be my little Hubie-boobie.

14:23.614 --> 14:25.980
Don't call me that in front
of the kid, here.

14:26.350 --> 14:27.544
Oh, honey.

14:27.718 --> 14:30.721
This is your little Bobbie-boobie talking.

14:30.821 --> 14:32.516
Now, I'm gonna...

14:34.492 --> 14:36.289
I'm gonna take a little nap.

14:36.627 --> 14:41.587
And you know how Bobbie Sue hates
to sleep alone.

14:43.200 --> 14:45.036
I'll be there in a minute, baby.

14:45.136 --> 14:47.036
Give me that drink, kid.

14:47.138 --> 14:49.038
I'll be waiting, sugar.

14:52.076 --> 14:53.543
I'm getting sleepy.

15:20.204 --> 15:21.472
No, no.

15:21.572 --> 15:22.707
What are you doing here?

15:22.807 --> 15:25.799
- What do you mean? You left us your key.
- Are you crazy?

15:25.943 --> 15:29.080
My husband will kill us both
if he finds you here.

15:29.180 --> 15:31.148
- What are we gonna do?
- Well, get dressed.

15:31.248 --> 15:33.512
I can't.
Your husband's sitting on my clothes.

15:45.229 --> 15:46.321
Ben!

15:47.164 --> 15:49.132
Come here. Ben.

15:50.768 --> 15:53.236
Come here. Get my clothes.

15:53.904 --> 15:55.166
Get them!

16:18.395 --> 16:19.623
Oh, boy!

16:22.399 --> 16:24.502
- Are you done already?
- Yes, sir.

16:24.602 --> 16:25.703
What's this?

16:25.803 --> 16:28.863
Don't take that off.
Leave it on for one hour.

16:29.940 --> 16:32.374
All right. Let me give you a tip.

16:32.710 --> 16:34.679
- No, that's okay.
- No, no, no.

16:34.779 --> 16:36.747
Come on, I always take care of my people.

16:37.481 --> 16:39.278
My husband's coming!

16:43.287 --> 16:44.948
Come on, come on.

16:49.760 --> 16:52.194
You know, I fell asleep out there?

16:53.297 --> 16:56.200
Is everything finished up
out there, honey?

16:56.300 --> 16:58.768
Yeah, yeah. Strange kid, but nice.

16:59.870 --> 17:02.964
I hate to tell you, baby,
but you need a shave.

17:03.607 --> 17:05.837
You're getting a little hairy.

17:13.717 --> 17:16.619
Good afternoon, sir.
I am the hotel barber. You sent for me?

17:16.720 --> 17:18.813
I changed my mind. Thanks a lot.

17:20.089 --> 17:22.226
You cannot change your mind.

17:22.326 --> 17:25.921
I had to cancel several other
appointments to fit you in.

17:27.131 --> 17:28.499
Just put it on my bill.

17:28.599 --> 17:31.466
I'm sorry. It must be cash.
Those are the hotel rules.

17:37.074 --> 17:39.042
Get off of me! I don't want a haircut.

17:41.478 --> 17:42.446
Damn.

17:42.546 --> 17:44.912
- I must insist.
- Get out of here!

17:47.384 --> 17:50.114
You put your money in the other drawer.

17:53.123 --> 17:57.059
Barber's a strange kid.
Strange. But he's nice. He's all right.

17:57.595 --> 18:00.331
Kids these days. I don't understand.

18:00.431 --> 18:01.659
Just...

18:03.200 --> 18:06.370
These kids these days, you know, I just...

18:06.470 --> 18:07.705
What a day, huh?

18:07.805 --> 18:10.007
- This is crazy!
- Sorry.

18:10.107 --> 18:12.268
How could you do this to me?

18:13.878 --> 18:15.312
Who's this guy?

18:15.412 --> 18:17.081
Good afternoon, sir.

18:17.181 --> 18:19.216
My name is Jacques.
Would you like a manicure?

18:19.316 --> 18:20.451
Never mind.

18:20.551 --> 18:21.886
- Can I see them?
- No. Here.

18:21.986 --> 18:23.020
Here's a tip for the both of you.

18:23.120 --> 18:24.655
- Thank you very much.
- Thank you very much, sir.

18:24.755 --> 18:26.690
It's all right. Go ahead, kid.
Thanks a lot.

18:26.790 --> 18:28.025
No, don't, it's not dry!

18:28.125 --> 18:30.491
Oh, don't worry about it. It's fine.

18:31.562 --> 18:32.859
Is something wrong, sir?

18:45.943 --> 18:47.035
<i>Ole!</i>

18:49.013 --> 18:51.573
Come back here! Come back here!

19:03.127 --> 19:05.789
What is going on around here?

19:05.963 --> 19:08.332
That's what I want to know. Who are you?

19:08.432 --> 19:11.569
- I am the head of the hotel's security.
- Oh, yeah?

19:11.669 --> 19:13.660
Look what your hotel barber did to me!
Look at this.

19:14.338 --> 19:15.406
This is all your fault!

19:15.506 --> 19:18.031
Yeah, right,
Mr. Create-a-little-part-down-his-head.

19:19.209 --> 19:21.507
Two, three, four,

19:21.812 --> 19:24.804
five, six, seven, eight.

19:28.485 --> 19:31.579
In and out. In and out.

19:32.256 --> 19:35.292
In and out. In and...

19:35.392 --> 19:37.061
All right, guys, is it in or out?

19:37.161 --> 19:38.429
- What?
- In or out?

19:38.529 --> 19:40.554
We have a class going on.

19:41.031 --> 19:42.333
In or out?

19:42.433 --> 19:44.424
We gotta run. Thanks, anyway.

19:47.371 --> 19:49.396
On second thought, yes, we'll stay.

20:02.519 --> 20:05.886
Turn around, and work out
with the class, or get out!

20:07.157 --> 20:09.693
Down. Do the deep knee bends, ladies.

20:09.793 --> 20:11.295
If you're gonna do it, do it right.

20:11.395 --> 20:13.386
Doing the best I can.

20:13.630 --> 20:16.121
Eight, down, up.

20:16.433 --> 20:19.925
Down, up. Down, up.

20:22.406 --> 20:25.307
If you're gonna do it. Do it right!

20:27.845 --> 20:30.746
You made my back go out, you cow!

20:30.881 --> 20:33.751
All right, that's it!
Out of my class. Now! Right now!

20:33.851 --> 20:37.184
First, I'm gonna kill that barber,
then I'm gonna come back and get you!

20:39.023 --> 20:40.786
Everybody, arms out.

20:41.191 --> 20:42.726
Flat back. Squeeze.

20:42.826 --> 20:44.328
All right, he's gone.
Let's get out of here.

20:44.428 --> 20:46.063
Two, three...

20:46.163 --> 20:48.299
No way. I'm in love.

20:48.399 --> 20:50.034
...seven, eight.

20:50.134 --> 20:53.704
And reach. Two, three, four,

20:53.804 --> 20:57.205
five, six, seven, eight.

21:08.018 --> 21:09.713
- Miss?
- Yes?

21:09.853 --> 21:12.823
This hotel has a dress code
in its public areas

21:12.923 --> 21:17.019
and I'm afraid that that swimsuit
is a bit too revealing.

21:17.494 --> 21:19.587
It's just a bikini.

21:21.398 --> 21:24.068
Nobody else complains when other girls

21:24.168 --> 21:26.898
wear their bottoms like this.

21:28.672 --> 21:31.140
Stop that! And fix this...

21:31.708 --> 21:33.403
Oh, I'm so sorry!

21:33.677 --> 21:36.544
What are you? Some kind of a pervert?

21:39.216 --> 21:43.812
Reeves, you are
a disgusting filthy animal!

21:44.221 --> 21:46.357
Not so fast, <i>Herr</i> Nagel.

21:46.457 --> 21:48.993
There's been a very serious complaint.

21:49.093 --> 21:53.197
You massacred a very distinguished guest.
And he's very upset.

21:53.297 --> 21:56.567
You know nothing! You are nothing!

21:56.667 --> 21:59.570
I am being a barber for 22 years!

21:59.670 --> 22:02.473
And you still haven't gotten it right!

22:02.573 --> 22:05.542
I can no longer tolerate insolence

22:05.776 --> 22:08.244
from a house dick, a pervert, a...

22:10.347 --> 22:13.145
- You trying to insult me, Nagel?
- Yes!

22:13.684 --> 22:15.311
I'm warning you.

22:15.586 --> 22:17.144
Go ahead.

22:18.822 --> 22:20.585
Make my day.

22:43.681 --> 22:45.883
If it wasn't for you and that
stupid key, I wouldn't be...

22:45.983 --> 22:47.885
All right, all right, one little mistake.

22:47.985 --> 22:50.821
But just because some idiot gorilla
with a gun hates our guts,

22:50.921 --> 22:53.788
are you gonna let that spoil
our whole weekend?

22:54.125 --> 22:56.559
Sit down, sit down.

22:59.997 --> 23:01.521
- Hi.
- Hi, there.

23:02.333 --> 23:05.791
- Can I get you something?
- I'm fine. I'm fine. I gotta run.

23:07.872 --> 23:09.206
How about you?

23:09.306 --> 23:10.864
You look great.

23:12.076 --> 23:13.144
Oh, thanks.

23:13.244 --> 23:15.479
Listen, I hope I didn't get you
in any trouble before

23:15.579 --> 23:17.308
when I knocked over your tray.

23:17.448 --> 23:18.683
Oh, no.

23:18.783 --> 23:23.049
I just started work here this week,
so he's taking it easy on me.

23:23.320 --> 23:25.982
Good. Seemed like that guy
was giving you a hard time.

23:26.357 --> 23:29.383
Well, he thought I was flirting with you.

23:31.295 --> 23:34.162
Actually, I'll have something with a lime.

23:34.632 --> 23:38.762
- What, is he your boyfriend?
- No. Something with a lime?

23:42.940 --> 23:45.610
- Oh, no!
- What's wrong?

23:45.710 --> 23:47.439
I dropped something.

23:54.485 --> 23:57.010
Listen, can I take you out tonight?

23:57.421 --> 23:59.123
What time do you get off?

23:59.223 --> 24:02.360
Oh, I can't. It's against the rules
to date the guests here.

24:02.460 --> 24:04.792
Well, I won't tell if you don't.

24:06.430 --> 24:10.635
I would like to, really, but I just can't
go out with any guy who asks.

24:10.735 --> 24:13.829
I'm not any guy. Come on.

24:14.638 --> 24:16.003
Well,

24:17.942 --> 24:19.068
okay.

24:19.977 --> 24:21.706
I get off at 11:30.

24:22.480 --> 24:25.210
But I don't know
if this is such a good idea.

24:25.483 --> 24:27.218
Patti, what are you doing under there?

24:27.318 --> 24:28.546
Oh, no!

24:32.523 --> 24:34.759
There are guests waiting for service.

24:34.859 --> 24:36.986
Come here. Right back, sir.

24:42.133 --> 24:44.402
All right. What the hell was that?

24:44.502 --> 24:47.138
I mean, every time I look around
you're with that guy.

24:47.238 --> 24:48.539
He lost his watch.

24:48.639 --> 24:50.875
Yeah, well,
you're about to lose your job, okay?

24:50.975 --> 24:54.612
Just stay away from that guy.
I'm telling you this for your own good.

24:54.712 --> 24:56.304
- Really.
- Thanks.

24:57.615 --> 24:59.242
Wait, wait, wait.

25:02.686 --> 25:05.222
Can I still give you a ride home tonight?

25:05.322 --> 25:08.485
I've already got a ride. Thanks, anyway.

25:13.130 --> 25:14.290
Right.

25:42.827 --> 25:44.962
Dude, excellent coat.

25:45.062 --> 25:47.231
You should try something in a red, though.

25:47.331 --> 25:50.698
This place is insane!
I'm having a great time.

25:51.435 --> 25:54.563
A mom and a dad! I'm home.

26:05.649 --> 26:08.174
Is this place always this crowded?

26:09.253 --> 26:11.517
Wait till we get to the sauna.

26:28.906 --> 26:30.931
You are a pervert!

27:03.674 --> 27:06.477
- Who's that girl, right there?
- Dana Rawlings.

27:06.577 --> 27:09.780
I gotta get to that girl.
You know anything about her?

27:09.880 --> 27:11.507
Oh, just everything.

27:14.952 --> 27:17.011
- Everything.
- Right.

27:17.454 --> 27:19.790
Now to get to her,
first you gotta get through her.

27:19.890 --> 27:21.292
That's the grandmother.

27:21.392 --> 27:23.227
Now she won't let just anybody
get near Dana.

27:23.327 --> 27:26.956
You gotta be a, you know,
a lawyer, or a doctor, or both.

27:27.965 --> 27:29.865
I'm neither one of those.

27:30.000 --> 27:31.399
Oh.

27:34.004 --> 27:36.871
- I don't know.
- Yeah, you don't know.

27:52.790 --> 27:55.960
Excuse me, is there a Dr. Marshall here?
I have a phone call.

27:56.060 --> 27:58.722
Phone call for a Dr. Marshall.

27:59.163 --> 28:00.562
- Dr. Marshall?
- That's me.

28:01.031 --> 28:02.931
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

28:05.936 --> 28:07.961
Hello, Dr. Marshall here.

28:08.505 --> 28:10.908
No, no, I don't operate on Mondays.

28:11.008 --> 28:12.977
Yeah, I operate on Tuesdays.

28:13.077 --> 28:14.601
Say that again?

28:15.646 --> 28:17.414
Yeah, well, I'll see you in surgery, huh?

28:17.514 --> 28:20.142
Okay. All right. Bye-bye.

28:22.786 --> 28:25.789
Gotta really stay on top
in this business, you know?

28:25.889 --> 28:28.959
You must be very important there, Doctor.

28:29.059 --> 28:31.195
Jack. Jack Marshall.

28:31.295 --> 28:32.696
Jack Marshall.

28:32.796 --> 28:36.267
- Of the Philadelphia Marshalls?
- Yes, that's right.

28:36.367 --> 28:38.135
How wonderful!

28:38.235 --> 28:42.638
You know, your father and I
once knew each other very well.

28:43.107 --> 28:44.870
I'm Amanda Rawlings.

28:45.042 --> 28:46.976
You're Amanda Rawlings.

28:47.344 --> 28:50.279
How nice.
Dad talks about you all the time.

28:52.082 --> 28:53.515
There's Dana.

28:54.885 --> 28:56.546
- Hello.
- Hi.

28:57.087 --> 28:58.645
Hi, sweetheart.

29:01.025 --> 29:05.826
This is my granddaughter.
Dana, this is Dr. Marshall.

29:06.430 --> 29:09.900
- Jack, I believe we've already met.
- Yes, we did. Sort of.

29:10.000 --> 29:12.264
You've met? How nice!

29:13.804 --> 29:16.364
Exactly what kind of doctor are you?

29:17.041 --> 29:18.565
What kind do you need?

29:19.510 --> 29:22.046
Dana, this is such an odd coincidence.

29:22.146 --> 29:25.513
I've known Dr. Marshall's family forever.

29:25.749 --> 29:29.310
He's just the kind of young man
you should be dating.

29:29.820 --> 29:31.617
Are you busy tonight?

29:32.022 --> 29:33.489
Oh, no.

29:33.690 --> 29:37.828
Excellent! Dana would love
to see you this evening.

29:37.928 --> 29:40.698
- Great.
- And so would her cousin Shirley.

29:40.798 --> 29:44.734
- Who?
- My other granddaughter. Lovely girl.

29:45.502 --> 29:49.370
- You don't mind if I bring a friend?
- No, no. That'd be great.

29:51.275 --> 29:52.469
Great.

29:54.545 --> 29:56.847
I don't want to be here.
You keep getting me into trouble.

29:56.947 --> 29:57.948
Come on, pal, don't let me down.

29:58.048 --> 30:01.819
Look, if you don't keep her cousin busy,
I'll never get Dana alone in my bedroom.

30:01.919 --> 30:03.520
I told you I have a date at 11:30.

30:03.620 --> 30:06.657
No problem. Just wait till you meet her.
She's a knockout.

30:06.757 --> 30:09.021
- I hope so.
- Here we go.

30:14.698 --> 30:16.256
Hi, come on in.

30:17.468 --> 30:19.336
Dana, this is my buddy, Ben.

30:19.436 --> 30:21.672
Hi, Ben. Are you a doctor, too?

30:21.772 --> 30:24.536
One of the best. He works in the morgue.

30:26.110 --> 30:27.737
How interesting.

30:28.011 --> 30:30.673
- Where's Shirley?
- She'll be right out.

30:31.381 --> 30:32.416
Shirley.

30:32.516 --> 30:34.084
- What do you think?
- Very nice.

30:34.184 --> 30:35.819
- I know how to pick them, huh?
- You do.

30:35.919 --> 30:38.547
Shirley, hurry up, your date is here.

30:41.425 --> 30:42.824
Oh, my God!

30:45.162 --> 30:46.686
Oh, there you are.

30:46.997 --> 30:50.455
- Deal's off.
- No, Ben. Come on!

30:51.969 --> 30:55.139
Jack, Ben, this is Shirley.

30:55.239 --> 30:56.306
Hi, Shirley.

30:56.406 --> 30:58.135
Call me Hali Zumba.

30:58.275 --> 31:00.209
That's her spirit name.

31:00.410 --> 31:01.809
Hali Zumba.

31:03.280 --> 31:06.350
My cousin studies the teachings
of Babi Rami Nani.

31:06.450 --> 31:08.350
That's Baba Rama Nana.

31:09.987 --> 31:12.717
He's the greatest of all spirit forces.

31:13.023 --> 31:15.685
No kidding! Fascinating.

31:16.293 --> 31:17.861
Very interesting.

31:17.961 --> 31:20.164
So, what do you say we hit the street?

31:20.264 --> 31:22.332
Sounds great.
Are you ready, cousin Zumba?

31:22.432 --> 31:24.423
Oh, I don't feel like going.

31:24.801 --> 31:28.066
But you go ahead and have a good time.

31:29.139 --> 31:30.265
Okay.

31:31.308 --> 31:32.775
Ladies first.

31:34.645 --> 31:38.215
- Whoa, where are you going?
- I'm not staying here with that nutcase.

31:38.315 --> 31:41.182
- We made a deal.
- Yeah, and you said she was a knockout.

31:43.387 --> 31:46.015
Come on, Ben, you're embarrassing me!

31:46.123 --> 31:49.126
All right, so she's not Miss America.
Give her a chance.

31:49.226 --> 31:51.328
Maybe you'll learn something
about Nana Banana.

31:51.428 --> 31:53.030
You might even get laid.

31:53.130 --> 31:55.098
Come on. She's an ice cube.

31:55.799 --> 31:58.461
Oh, God. Ben, stay here.

32:00.470 --> 32:03.496
Look, a couple of these
will put her in heat.

32:04.308 --> 32:05.570
Aspirin?

32:05.809 --> 32:07.834
Quaaludes! The love drug.

32:08.445 --> 32:09.446
I'm telling you,

32:09.546 --> 32:12.049
one pill will make her so horny
she'll melt in your hands.

32:12.149 --> 32:15.118
- Jack. Jack, are we going?
- Yeah, we're gone.

32:15.852 --> 32:17.342
Come on, Ben!

32:20.390 --> 32:22.620
Don't get too crazy, you two.

32:23.026 --> 32:24.425
Okay, Jack.

32:24.761 --> 32:27.127
And don't forget those aspirins.

32:28.532 --> 32:30.159
I like your name.

32:41.111 --> 32:43.079
Why do you take aspirin?

32:43.380 --> 32:44.904
I have a headache.

32:46.316 --> 32:47.806
Care for one?

33:16.613 --> 33:20.515
Excuse me,
but my eyes could not believe me.

33:20.684 --> 33:23.987
Such a lovely flower
like you here, my dear.

33:24.087 --> 33:25.189
Beer?

33:25.289 --> 33:28.019
No, no, I'm drinking champagne.

33:29.860 --> 33:31.259
The bubbly.

33:31.428 --> 33:35.990
Allow me to introduce myself.
I am Count Igor Kaminsky Repulsky.

33:38.302 --> 33:40.270
But you can call me Rip.

33:40.937 --> 33:42.339
Would you care to dance?

33:42.439 --> 33:43.440
What?

33:43.540 --> 33:45.709
Dance, dance. Would you care to dance?

33:45.809 --> 33:47.504
I beg your pardon?

33:48.045 --> 33:49.535
Dance! Dance!

33:49.913 --> 33:51.548
I'd love to.

33:51.648 --> 33:53.946
Wonderful. Please. Please come.

33:55.018 --> 33:56.679
The broad's deaf.

34:11.467 --> 34:12.628
Yes.

34:15.237 --> 34:16.603
Beautiful.

34:23.880 --> 34:25.370
One more time.

34:26.183 --> 34:28.310
You glide like a butterfly.

34:45.335 --> 34:48.031
Count. What are you doing?

34:49.606 --> 34:52.473
I couldn't resist giving you a little hug.

34:52.943 --> 34:54.534
You naughty man.

35:00.584 --> 35:04.042
- What happened to your hair?
- It's a long story.

35:05.288 --> 35:09.293
Will you excuse me, please?
I think I'm getting a terrible headache.

35:09.393 --> 35:11.452
Wait, perhaps we could...

35:12.696 --> 35:14.664
Thank you for the dance.

35:25.108 --> 35:27.577
Dude. Hey, nice hair.

35:27.677 --> 35:29.846
- Get out of here, kid.
- Hey, thanks, dude.

35:29.946 --> 35:32.744
- Nice hair, who does it?
- Get out of here.

35:52.035 --> 35:55.005
How is your headache now, Raga Lama?

35:55.105 --> 35:56.197
Gone.

35:56.840 --> 35:57.932
Good.

35:58.341 --> 36:02.573
Listen, this has really been interesting.
Thank you. But I have to go.

36:02.746 --> 36:05.415
To get rid of a headache is not enough.

36:05.515 --> 36:07.651
You must strive to be happy.

36:07.751 --> 36:08.985
I'm happy.

36:09.085 --> 36:11.918
No, that is not a happy body.

36:13.757 --> 36:15.850
Not until you are totally free.

36:26.036 --> 36:28.129
Be free with me, Raga Lama.

36:28.972 --> 36:31.600
You must lose your artificial layers.

36:32.108 --> 36:33.507
Oh, my God!

36:39.649 --> 36:42.516
- You mean my clothes?
- Yes!

36:43.253 --> 36:46.450
Quickly. They hold back
the joining of our souls.

36:59.603 --> 37:02.731
Now remove the final shell.

37:02.939 --> 37:04.338
Final what?

37:04.541 --> 37:06.099
Your underwear.

37:23.293 --> 37:25.921
Gaze upon the face of Baba Rama Nana.

37:27.097 --> 37:30.534
Can you see the beautiful light
shining from his eyes?

37:30.634 --> 37:31.601
Beautiful.

37:31.701 --> 37:34.864
Can you feel your spirit growing?

37:38.775 --> 37:40.174
Yes, I can.

37:41.444 --> 37:42.612
So, Jack,

37:42.712 --> 37:45.772
I hope your friend behaves himself
with cousin Shirley.

37:45.882 --> 37:46.883
Why?

37:46.983 --> 37:49.645
Well, Baba Rama's totally against sex.

37:49.886 --> 37:51.621
How do you feel about sex?

37:51.721 --> 37:53.382
Oh, I think it's fine.

37:55.091 --> 37:57.252
But never on the first date.

37:57.827 --> 38:00.523
You're still gonna need a full checkup.

38:09.806 --> 38:13.105
Please, Baba Rama, come into my soul.

38:13.843 --> 38:15.242
Come to me.

38:15.345 --> 38:16.980
- Come to me.
- Yes, come to me.

38:17.080 --> 38:19.149
- Come to me.
- Yes, come to me.

38:19.249 --> 38:20.910
- Come to me.
- Yes.

38:21.117 --> 38:23.286
- Come to me. I can't take it!
- Yes! Yes!

38:23.386 --> 38:25.684
No! What are you doing?

38:25.889 --> 38:28.492
Flesh cannot touch flesh
in the master's presence!

38:28.592 --> 38:30.719
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.

38:30.827 --> 38:33.730
Believe me, I swear. Really. I swear.

38:33.830 --> 38:35.354
I didn't know.

38:43.840 --> 38:46.832
Now I must re-purify myself
in the night air.

38:47.477 --> 38:48.603
Okay.

38:48.912 --> 38:50.539
Close your eyes.

38:52.315 --> 38:54.112
Approach the master.

38:57.520 --> 39:00.978
Now repeat, come to me.

39:01.992 --> 39:03.360
Come to me.

39:03.460 --> 39:04.859
Come to me.

39:05.261 --> 39:06.626
Come to me.

39:07.530 --> 39:08.895
Come to me.

39:09.065 --> 39:10.396
Come to me.

39:11.434 --> 39:12.799
Come to me.

39:13.103 --> 39:14.502
Come to me.

39:15.205 --> 39:16.900
I'll be back soon.

39:18.408 --> 39:19.807
Come to me.

39:21.911 --> 39:23.310
Come to me.

39:26.783 --> 39:28.580
Listen, Baba Rama,

39:29.285 --> 39:30.547
please,

39:31.488 --> 39:33.149
let me screw her.

39:34.624 --> 39:35.886
My head.

39:37.160 --> 39:39.822
Count Igor Repulsky.

39:40.196 --> 39:41.993
So suave.

39:43.166 --> 39:45.100
And so sophisticated.

39:46.436 --> 39:48.996
What a shame about his head.

39:49.873 --> 39:53.900
I hope I didn't offend him
by running away.

39:55.045 --> 39:58.037
Because I do have a splitting headache.

40:02.686 --> 40:07.214
Come to me. Come to me.

40:13.830 --> 40:15.229
Come to me.

40:19.169 --> 40:21.338
- Let me out.
- Get away from me.

40:21.438 --> 40:23.239
Baba Rama, help!

40:23.339 --> 40:24.574
Ouch! Please.

40:24.674 --> 40:28.812
Get out of here, you vile,
degenerate scum.

40:28.912 --> 40:30.280
Get away from me! Get away from me!

40:30.380 --> 40:33.281
Get out of here!
Out of here, you degenerate!

40:39.422 --> 40:42.550
Aspirin. What angel left these?

40:42.992 --> 40:45.153
I'd better take four.

40:56.005 --> 40:57.407
Hi, how are you doing?

40:57.507 --> 40:58.872
Good evening, sir.

41:03.480 --> 41:05.505
Jack, let me in! Jack!

41:07.550 --> 41:09.119
- Jack!
- Ben?

41:09.219 --> 41:10.487
Yeah, it's me! Let me in!

41:10.587 --> 41:12.922
Come on, buddy, Dana's starting to weaken.
Give me a half hour.

41:13.022 --> 41:15.992
Jack, if I don't put something on, I'm gonna
get in a lot of trouble. Now come on!

41:16.092 --> 41:18.528
Those Quaaludes are killers, huh? Hang on.

41:18.628 --> 41:22.064
- Just a minute, young man!
- Hi, how are you?

41:24.234 --> 41:26.759
That's pretty unusual evening wear.

41:26.870 --> 41:30.607
This? Bathing suit.
I was just going down to take a swim.

41:30.707 --> 41:34.144
That's odd. It looked to me like
you were trying to break into this door!

41:34.244 --> 41:38.203
- No. It's my room.
- May I see your key?

41:39.015 --> 41:41.210
Here you go, buddy. Have fun.

41:46.756 --> 41:49.418
You pervert! Choo-choo, Twinkie, attack!

41:50.794 --> 41:51.988
Go on.

41:52.529 --> 41:55.020
Get them off me! I can't stand these dogs!

41:55.965 --> 41:57.398
Please!

42:00.637 --> 42:03.071
You bastard! You bastard!

42:03.406 --> 42:04.566
Kill!

42:15.151 --> 42:17.813
Kill! Kill! After him!

42:43.446 --> 42:45.815
Come over here. I'm in a spot.
Could you help me out here?

42:45.915 --> 42:47.576
Come here.

42:48.084 --> 42:49.919
Could you help me a second?
Come over here.

42:50.019 --> 42:52.544
Just come over here.
Right here. That's it.

42:53.456 --> 42:56.226
How are you? Just help me out.
Stand right here.

42:56.326 --> 42:58.294
And help bring this up. That's it.

42:58.394 --> 42:59.462
- Hold tight.
- That's it.

42:59.562 --> 43:02.966
Help bring... That's the way.
There you go. That's very good.

43:03.066 --> 43:06.035
I've never seen
a gentleman hung upside down before.

43:06.135 --> 43:07.237
- Okay.
- Okay.

43:07.337 --> 43:09.906
Thank you very much. God!

43:10.006 --> 43:13.009
- Oh, my God. I'm sorry.
- Me, too.

43:13.109 --> 43:14.410
- Bring it all the way up.
- Yes.

43:14.510 --> 43:18.173
All right, thank you. All right.
Here. Here. Here. Okay, here you go.

43:19.482 --> 43:22.883
- Here, quick. Leave. Go.
- God bless you.

43:31.494 --> 43:36.363
Through hanging around, sugar?
Oh, honey, I hope that thing's working.

43:38.034 --> 43:41.595
- Now sit and eat your din-din.
- I'm not hungry.

43:49.412 --> 43:52.682
I came so close
to getting that diamond, so close!

43:52.782 --> 43:55.585
If it wasn't for this lousy haircut,
I would've had it!

43:55.685 --> 43:58.388
If I catch that barber,
I'm gonna blow his head off!

43:58.488 --> 44:01.457
I'm gonna slice him up
like a goddamn salami!

44:04.394 --> 44:06.919
Honey, relax. Relax.

44:07.563 --> 44:09.465
- Just relax.
- Yeah, relax. Relax.

44:09.565 --> 44:10.633
Your hair will grow back.

44:10.733 --> 44:13.469
Go on. If I don't get that stone,
I'm gonna be a dead man.

44:13.569 --> 44:15.939
Oh, sweetie,
everything's gonna be all right.

44:16.039 --> 44:17.674
- No, it won't.
- Yes, it will.

44:17.774 --> 44:20.009
Why don't you go take that nice,
hot bath I ran for you?

44:20.109 --> 44:22.512
- I don't wanna.
- I'll join you in a minute.

44:22.612 --> 44:24.637
We'll play "peek-a-boobie."

44:26.649 --> 44:30.449
"Peek-a-boobie"? Really? All right.

45:00.249 --> 45:04.621
All right, honey, what took you so long?
Come on in here.

45:04.721 --> 45:08.124
Daddy's been waiting for you. That's it.

45:08.224 --> 45:10.852
It's peek-a-boobie time!

45:17.266 --> 45:18.665
What the...

45:19.369 --> 45:21.803
You! You!

45:35.418 --> 45:39.155
- Your barber was here again!
- Yes, sir, and he made you look much better.

45:39.255 --> 45:41.280
Morons everywhere! Morons!

45:48.931 --> 45:51.334
My grandmother's probably home by now.

45:51.434 --> 45:53.664
She can take care of herself.

46:02.845 --> 46:04.335
Be right back.

46:14.223 --> 46:18.455
- Hey, Ben, had a wild time, huh?
- Yeah. Thank you!

46:19.529 --> 46:21.463
What's wrong with you?

46:34.310 --> 46:37.575
- You still here, huh?
- Yeah.

46:38.081 --> 46:42.381
- What happened to your big ride?
- I don't know.

46:44.153 --> 46:46.280
Well, my offer still stands.

46:46.956 --> 46:48.548
If you wanna go.

46:49.492 --> 46:51.961
Come on, Patti,
I mean, you can't wait here all night.

46:52.061 --> 46:54.461
Let me just give you a ride home.

46:56.132 --> 47:00.125
- All right. Okay.
- Great. My car is right here. Check this out.

47:01.437 --> 47:04.407
See, I got the custom pinstripes
and wheels there. Like it?

47:04.507 --> 47:05.599
Yeah.

47:11.547 --> 47:14.539
I guess you could
call this our first date, huh?

47:15.885 --> 47:18.115
It's just a ride, Scott. Okay?

47:18.488 --> 47:20.656
I want to make sure
that you understand that.

47:20.756 --> 47:22.951
Okay, okay, I was just kidding.

47:25.194 --> 47:27.719
But you never know what might happen.

48:04.667 --> 48:06.897
I think I need another aspirin.

48:15.811 --> 48:18.644
I love a man in uniform.

48:27.823 --> 48:31.260
Hello, sailor. Looking for a little fun?

48:31.360 --> 48:34.230
Mrs. Rawlings, please, you...
Mrs. Rawlings!

48:34.330 --> 48:38.067
I am the barber in the hotel!
Mrs. Rawlings!

48:38.167 --> 48:40.499
Will you please control yourself!

48:47.476 --> 48:51.981
I like it! I like it! I like it!

48:52.081 --> 48:53.742
Mrs. Rawlings! Mrs. Rawlings!

48:53.883 --> 48:58.343
Don't worry about the pain, <i>Liebchen!</i>
I have aspirin!

48:58.654 --> 49:00.053
I like it!

49:02.858 --> 49:06.262
Hey, Ben. How are you doing?
Been looking all over for you.

49:06.362 --> 49:08.728
- Can I help you guys?
- Beer.

49:08.864 --> 49:12.925
I tell you honey, lust is a crazy thing.

49:13.269 --> 49:15.999
I'll be right back, sweetie.
Don't you go away.

49:24.880 --> 49:26.749
I should've known, Curt.

49:26.849 --> 49:29.952
Our first night here
and you're already hitting on other girls.

49:30.052 --> 49:31.420
You've got it all wrong, babe.

49:31.520 --> 49:33.990
I'm just sitting around,
having a couple of beers

49:34.090 --> 49:36.092
with these guys, right?

49:36.192 --> 49:39.650
- Yeah.
- There, you see! Why so suspicious?

49:39.829 --> 49:43.356
You want to stay here and chase girls?
That's fine with me.

49:44.267 --> 49:48.897
Because I'm gonna go out there
and pick up on the first guy I run into.

49:51.974 --> 49:53.601
Yeah. Beautiful.

49:59.882 --> 50:02.118
- Come here. Do me a favor.
- What?

50:02.218 --> 50:03.786
If this guy tries to leave,
you stall him, okay.

50:03.886 --> 50:04.954
Why?

50:05.054 --> 50:07.690
Because all I have to do
is be the first guy that she runs into.

50:07.790 --> 50:10.193
You're crazy, man.
Look at the size of him.

50:10.293 --> 50:13.421
Look, just don't let him
go back to his room, all right?

50:13.896 --> 50:16.296
- Did you miss me?
- Oh, yeah.

50:30.079 --> 50:33.115
Did you really mean it?
I mean, about the first guy you run into?

50:33.215 --> 50:35.218
- I sure did.
- What room are you in?

50:35.318 --> 50:37.343
My boyfriend may show up there.

50:39.023 --> 50:43.082
It's got to be your room. Come on.

50:48.398 --> 50:49.888
How you doing?

50:50.767 --> 50:52.503
See the blonde over there?

50:52.603 --> 50:57.063
Pretty nice, huh?
Wants me to take her back to my room.

50:58.275 --> 51:01.145
- Your room? Don't do that.
- Why not?

51:01.245 --> 51:03.013
Here. Take her to my room. Okay?

51:03.113 --> 51:06.016
Your room. Hey, thanks a lot.
That'll help me out.

51:06.116 --> 51:09.486
Why don't you do me a favor?
Walk her up there for me.

51:09.586 --> 51:11.288
This way I don't get caught.

51:11.388 --> 51:15.290
- You're kidding?
- No, man. This is serious.

51:21.098 --> 51:22.224
Come on in.

51:25.035 --> 51:29.199
- Oh, what a cute place.
- Thanks. Make yourself at home.

51:30.240 --> 51:33.209
- Can I use the bathroom?
- Yes. Right there.

51:34.945 --> 51:36.139
Thanks.

51:41.718 --> 51:45.154
Jack, I think I'm going to be sick.

51:45.622 --> 51:47.419
Why does this have to happen to me?

51:49.793 --> 51:51.920
- Oh, no.
- What?

51:53.730 --> 51:57.701
- Her boyfriend is on his way up here!
- How could you do this to me?

51:57.801 --> 52:01.202
What could I do? He was going to his room.
You said you were gonna be there!

52:04.708 --> 52:08.769
- How's about a drink, sailor?
- That's just what you need.

52:10.714 --> 52:13.979
- Who is it?
- It's him. We're dead.

52:16.887 --> 52:18.252
- Hurry up!
- Okay.

52:23.894 --> 52:25.452
Hi. Come on in.

52:27.631 --> 52:31.624
Hey, nice place. Fruit and everything.

52:32.069 --> 52:35.139
- What are you doing here?
- I live here. We're sharing the place.

52:35.239 --> 52:36.228
Yeah.

52:36.840 --> 52:38.171
I'm kidding.

52:40.377 --> 52:42.613
Oh, hi, Curt.

52:42.713 --> 52:46.877
Oh, yes, yes, yes. Honey.

52:51.655 --> 52:53.589
Hold all my calls, okay?

52:54.625 --> 52:56.092
Funny guy.

53:00.797 --> 53:03.600
- This is it, this is it.
- Right here?

53:03.700 --> 53:08.228
- This is the place.
- You are so strong.

53:12.709 --> 53:14.006
What should we do?

53:17.914 --> 53:19.643
Go, go. Hurry up.

53:28.191 --> 53:31.718
One second, honey.
Honey, I'll be right back, I promise.

53:32.963 --> 53:35.295
Hey, you guys got something to drink?

53:37.734 --> 53:39.531
- Sure.
- Great.

53:43.340 --> 53:45.365
- Gin, okay?
- Fine.

53:47.077 --> 53:49.746
Seems you had enough to drink already.

53:49.846 --> 53:52.610
- Help yourself.
- Hey, thanks a lot.

53:57.788 --> 54:01.458
- You guys really know how to party.
- Yeah, we're celebrating. It's Ben's birthday.

54:01.558 --> 54:04.891
- How nice. Happy birthday.
- Thanks.

54:07.164 --> 54:08.358
Honey?

54:16.073 --> 54:17.267
Look,

54:18.342 --> 54:21.470
one more thing.
You guys got some protection?

54:22.212 --> 54:23.611
Protection?

54:24.715 --> 54:28.776
- Is that enough?
- Yeah. For now.

54:29.786 --> 54:31.117
Thank you.

54:35.892 --> 54:37.450
Thanks a lot.

54:38.428 --> 54:40.230
You're a great guy, you know that?

54:40.330 --> 54:41.798
- Thanks.
- I mean that.

54:41.898 --> 54:45.026
- You are, too.
- No, no, no, you.

54:46.103 --> 54:48.537
- Thanks.
- Hey, look on your shoulder.

54:50.273 --> 54:52.241
Thanks. Thanks.

54:53.176 --> 54:54.404
Honey?

54:56.213 --> 55:00.484
If we get out of this alive, I swear
I'll never do anything for anyone again.

55:00.584 --> 55:02.586
- Who is it?
- Maid service.

55:02.686 --> 55:04.176
Just a minute!

55:17.768 --> 55:20.237
Good evening, gentlemen,
is there anything you need?

55:20.337 --> 55:22.306
- No.
- Everything's fine, thanks.

55:22.406 --> 55:24.741
Good. Then I'll just
turn down your beds for you.

55:24.841 --> 55:27.469
Don't! We like to do it ourselves.

55:32.482 --> 55:34.885
That's his sister. She's sick.

55:34.985 --> 55:37.988
So thanks for everything.
You've been really wonderful.

55:38.088 --> 55:39.990
Why don't you come back
when you have more time?

55:40.090 --> 55:42.115
You're very cute.

55:54.438 --> 55:57.498
- Go, go, go!
- Hey, fellows!

55:58.375 --> 56:01.435
- To the balcony.
- To the bar, man! Go.

56:05.682 --> 56:07.582
Come here, you animal.

56:12.122 --> 56:13.919
I'll be right back.

56:17.994 --> 56:21.691
Hey, guys, you got some cigarettes around?

56:22.332 --> 56:26.536
- Yeah, yeah, we got some cigarettes.
- Sure, right in here. Come on. Right in here.

56:26.636 --> 56:29.833
Hey, hey, hey! Don't push.
Come on, come on!

57:08.445 --> 57:09.673
Where is she?

57:10.380 --> 57:11.615
- You lying son of a bitch!
- Help!

57:11.715 --> 57:12.716
Who is this slut?

57:12.816 --> 57:15.886
- I'll kill you! I've had enough...
- Is there a problem here?

57:15.986 --> 57:17.587
- No.
- You son of a bitch.

57:17.687 --> 57:19.348
- No problem.
- I'll kill you!

57:20.023 --> 57:22.058
I thought I heard screams.

57:22.158 --> 57:23.284
Who is she?

57:24.327 --> 57:26.192
Who do you think you are?

57:26.396 --> 57:28.091
No! Everything's fine!

57:30.033 --> 57:32.661
You little punks! You set me up!

57:33.937 --> 57:35.097
Go!

57:35.305 --> 57:38.433
- Come back here!
- You creep, I hate you.

57:47.817 --> 57:49.341
Another round?

58:03.800 --> 58:07.904
- Hey. Where are you going?
- Going home.

58:08.004 --> 58:09.973
I thought you were here
for the whole weekend.

58:10.073 --> 58:11.141
I changed my mind.

58:11.241 --> 58:15.612
Oh. I guess you also changed your mind
about meeting me last night.

58:15.712 --> 58:20.083
Oh, yeah, me. I was here.
I saw you leave with that guy.

58:20.183 --> 58:23.983
Well, you were a half an hour late
and I needed a ride.

58:25.255 --> 58:28.156
Believe me,
I really wanted to go with you.

58:29.526 --> 58:32.017
- Really?
- Yeah.

58:32.796 --> 58:33.854
Yeah?

58:34.531 --> 58:35.520
No.

58:36.399 --> 58:39.698
You know, you can always
change your mind again and stay.

58:40.437 --> 58:41.563
What for?

58:42.572 --> 58:45.166
- Tonight might work out better.
- Yeah?

58:45.875 --> 58:47.103
Really?

58:47.611 --> 58:48.703
Okay.

58:50.180 --> 58:51.915
Patti, let's go. You got work to do.

58:52.015 --> 58:54.985
- Okay. One minute, Scott.
- No. Right now.

58:55.085 --> 58:58.486
- Okay, I'll be right there. Okay?
- Excuse me.

59:01.658 --> 59:05.695
- Let go of me. Hey, that hurts!
- So what? I told you not to talk to that guy!

59:05.795 --> 59:08.532
- Just let go, okay?
- Hey, let her go.

59:08.632 --> 59:10.734
You stay out of this, okay?
It's none of your business.

59:10.834 --> 59:12.267
Yeah, it is.

59:12.702 --> 59:13.970
- Are you all right?
- Yeah, I'm...

59:14.070 --> 59:16.061
- Come on.
- Scott! No!

59:17.240 --> 59:19.105
No! No, stop! Please!

59:21.745 --> 59:23.914
You keep your nose out
of other people's business.

59:24.014 --> 59:26.608
- And you, I'll talk to you later.
- You jerk.

59:28.051 --> 59:29.882
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

59:32.055 --> 59:35.525
- I'm so sorry I got you involved in all this.
- That's all right. That's all right.

59:35.625 --> 59:36.785
Sorry.

59:39.929 --> 59:41.021
Thank you.

01:01:12.823 --> 01:01:17.692
- Hello, my darling.
- Count! What an unexpected pleasure.

01:01:17.961 --> 01:01:19.792
And just in time for brunch.

01:01:20.330 --> 01:01:24.528
- Are we alone?
- Just the two of us. Isn't it romantic?

01:01:25.902 --> 01:01:29.272
Can I get you anything?
I have orange juice, coffee,

01:01:29.372 --> 01:01:31.475
even a bit of champagne.

01:01:31.575 --> 01:01:33.509
My dear, but I think

01:01:35.111 --> 01:01:36.908
you know what I want.

01:01:38.648 --> 01:01:42.812
- You don't mean?
- Yes. Yes, I do.

01:01:43.353 --> 01:01:46.151
I'm sorry if I led you on.

01:01:46.423 --> 01:01:50.761
I wasn't myself last night.
I'm flattered that you're interested in me,

01:01:50.861 --> 01:01:54.160
but I have other commitments.

01:01:54.331 --> 01:01:56.765
No. I don't think you understand.

01:01:57.033 --> 01:01:58.796
I want your diamond.

01:01:59.569 --> 01:02:00.695
What?

01:02:00.937 --> 01:02:04.141
Now listen good.
I don't want brunch, I don't want romance,

01:02:04.241 --> 01:02:05.475
I want that diamond!

01:02:05.575 --> 01:02:08.169
- Rip!
- Rip, my ass! Give me that diamond!

01:02:09.412 --> 01:02:12.916
- No way, buster!
- Come on. I don't have time to play games.

01:02:13.016 --> 01:02:14.483
Give me that diamond.

01:02:16.052 --> 01:02:18.680
I got you now. Come on.

01:02:19.256 --> 01:02:20.257
Count Rip.

01:02:20.357 --> 01:02:23.560
- Okay!
- Okay. No more Mr. Nice Guy!

01:02:23.660 --> 01:02:25.628
Now I'm gonna have to hurt you. Come on.

01:02:37.374 --> 01:02:39.501
And stay out!

01:02:44.080 --> 01:02:46.048
Count, my ass!

01:02:48.985 --> 01:02:50.520
Hello, operator?

01:02:50.620 --> 01:02:53.054
Could you give me security, please?

01:02:59.062 --> 01:03:02.833
Security? Oh, yes. I...

01:03:02.933 --> 01:03:05.993
Put it down. Come on, put it down.

01:03:06.603 --> 01:03:09.128
All right, lady. Playtime's over.

01:03:09.906 --> 01:03:12.209
First, you're gonna give me that diamond.

01:03:12.309 --> 01:03:14.778
Yeah, then I'm gonna
lock you in the bathroom.

01:03:14.878 --> 01:03:18.814
Then you can karate the shit
out of yourself. How's that sound?

01:03:20.517 --> 01:03:23.453
Yeah. "Count, my ass," huh?

01:03:23.553 --> 01:03:26.044
Come on. It's noon already.

01:03:26.356 --> 01:03:29.689
Besides, you said
you'd take me to the fashion show.

01:03:29.893 --> 01:03:32.885
Come on, I'll race you to the shower.
Come on.

01:03:35.031 --> 01:03:36.066
You win.

01:03:36.166 --> 01:03:38.691
- Good morning.
- Sure is.

01:03:50.213 --> 01:03:52.272
- Surprise!
- Hi.

01:03:59.556 --> 01:04:00.784
Hi, Ben.

01:04:00.991 --> 01:04:04.761
- Hi. I missed you.
- It's only been seven hours.

01:04:04.861 --> 01:04:06.055
I know.

01:04:11.201 --> 01:04:12.862
I missed you, too.

01:04:13.637 --> 01:04:17.474
- How did you know I was so hungry?
- I didn't. You ordered all this stuff.

01:04:17.574 --> 01:04:19.576
- No, I didn't.
- You didn't?

01:04:19.676 --> 01:04:21.200
Oh, I did, Ben.

01:04:23.680 --> 01:04:25.147
Oh, I see.

01:04:26.049 --> 01:04:30.543
Well, sorry to interrupt you two. See you.

01:04:31.454 --> 01:04:32.522
Patti.

01:04:32.622 --> 01:04:36.393
- Patti, come on, let me explain!
- Just leave me alone, okay?

01:04:36.493 --> 01:04:38.228
- Yeah, I know. I know.
- You know it is.

01:04:38.328 --> 01:04:39.955
It's the barber!

01:04:40.997 --> 01:04:45.068
- Oh, Hubie, let the poor kid go!
- Grab a cab. I'll meet you out front!

01:04:45.168 --> 01:04:46.269
Hubert!

01:04:46.369 --> 01:04:49.395
Come here! I'm not gonna hurt you!
Just gonna kill you!

01:04:50.240 --> 01:04:51.707
Let him live!

01:05:03.386 --> 01:05:05.684
Let's see, how are we doing over here?

01:05:10.060 --> 01:05:13.257
Hurry up, girls!
We're starting in one minute.

01:05:13.530 --> 01:05:15.725
Come on ladies, let's line up.

01:05:15.999 --> 01:05:19.526
- May I help you?
- I'm just looking for somebody.

01:05:20.236 --> 01:05:23.262
Oh, the Merry Widow! Come on, get in line!

01:05:23.473 --> 01:05:26.601
Everyone's ready except for you.
Oh, honey.

01:05:26.710 --> 01:05:29.235
Honey, would you zip her up, please?

01:05:29.546 --> 01:05:32.879
With pleasure. I love widows.

01:05:33.383 --> 01:05:37.376
Girls, make this your best show ever.

01:05:37.620 --> 01:05:38.917
Let's go.

01:05:39.155 --> 01:05:42.591
I've seen them all, baby.
But you're definitely a 10.

01:05:43.760 --> 01:05:45.962
They call me The Maestro.
What's your name?

01:05:46.062 --> 01:05:49.833
You know, you look like somebody I...
What's the matter? I say something wrong?

01:05:49.933 --> 01:05:51.560
Wait, let me walk you.

01:05:53.169 --> 01:05:57.128
Oh, I don't know
what's taking him so long.

01:05:57.640 --> 01:05:59.733
He ought to be here by now.

01:06:02.278 --> 01:06:05.148
Hey, wait a minute.
Now where are you going in such a hurry?

01:06:05.248 --> 01:06:07.409
You don't have to run away from me.

01:06:07.650 --> 01:06:11.347
You're the quiet type, huh?
That's good. That's good.

01:06:13.590 --> 01:06:17.117
I've been looking for you all my life.
No, I mean it, baby.

01:06:17.227 --> 01:06:19.525
We'd look great together, just great.

01:06:20.663 --> 01:06:22.494
Listen, if I... Excuse me.

01:06:23.199 --> 01:06:25.435
We have bodybuilders over here?
What is this?

01:06:25.535 --> 01:06:28.505
I'm serious, baby. When I like somebody,
I really like them, doll.

01:06:28.605 --> 01:06:31.335
Now, just a little kiss.
I want just a little kiss.

01:06:37.781 --> 01:06:39.248
Well, hello.

01:07:13.316 --> 01:07:16.479
You son of a bitch! Get out of here.

01:07:17.453 --> 01:07:19.823
No, don't leave me, baby.
Don't get scared now.

01:07:19.923 --> 01:07:22.392
I'm not gonna hurt you.
I wouldn't hurt you, baby.

01:07:22.492 --> 01:07:25.928
Here. I got something to show you. Here.
You like this? Look at that.

01:07:26.930 --> 01:07:30.661
Ice is nice. Ice is nice. Look at that.

01:07:32.101 --> 01:07:36.306
Yeah, ice is nice. Oops.
Wait, wait, whoa, wait. Wait, wait.

01:07:36.406 --> 01:07:40.365
I need that. All right? I need that.
But first, give me a kiss.

01:07:40.476 --> 01:07:41.465
Give me a little...

01:07:42.312 --> 01:07:43.370
You!

01:07:43.713 --> 01:07:45.010
Son of a...

01:07:49.185 --> 01:07:52.055
- Help me catch that barber. He's a thief.
- That's a woman, sir.

01:07:52.155 --> 01:07:55.358
You moron, that's a faggot barber
and he's got my diamond in his tits!

01:07:55.458 --> 01:07:56.584
Come on.

01:07:59.262 --> 01:08:00.251
Come on.

01:08:02.465 --> 01:08:03.898
Come on.

01:08:11.174 --> 01:08:12.342
All right. He went that way.

01:08:12.442 --> 01:08:14.000
- Right.
- Let's go.

01:08:22.685 --> 01:08:26.122
Hey, babe.
What, are you crazy coming here?

01:08:26.221 --> 01:08:29.893
My girlfriend's in the room over here
and your boyfriend puts a gun to my head.

01:08:29.993 --> 01:08:31.294
I mean, hey, look, look.

01:08:31.394 --> 01:08:34.497
- Maybe we could go to your place, huh?
- Maybe some other time.

01:08:34.596 --> 01:08:35.791
Jesus.

01:08:44.073 --> 01:08:46.166
Thank you, Baba Rama Nana.

01:08:51.581 --> 01:08:53.104
All right, give me this!

01:08:53.216 --> 01:08:55.251
All right, give me the diamonds!
The diamonds. Come on.

01:08:55.350 --> 01:08:56.511
You want my what?

01:09:13.036 --> 01:09:14.127
Choo-choo, Twinkie.

01:09:15.071 --> 01:09:16.732
Kill! Kill!

01:09:16.939 --> 01:09:19.203
Kill! Kill!

01:09:23.279 --> 01:09:24.712
Freeze!

01:09:28.917 --> 01:09:32.522
- Get that barber. Let's go. Come on.
- Sir, he's definitely not the barber.

01:09:32.622 --> 01:09:36.725
I'm not talking about occupations here.
He's got my diamond. Come on.

01:09:36.826 --> 01:09:38.259
Come on. Come on.

01:09:43.700 --> 01:09:44.859
Jesus!

01:09:45.401 --> 01:09:47.904
Jack, Jack, help, help.
They're trying to kill me.

01:09:48.004 --> 01:09:49.005
Lady, I don't know you.

01:09:49.104 --> 01:09:50.173
- It's me, it's me.
- Ben?

01:09:50.273 --> 01:09:51.763
Let's go. Run.

01:09:52.875 --> 01:09:56.572
- Stop, or I'll shoot.
- Shoot first and then yell stop, you idiot.

01:10:01.317 --> 01:10:03.751
Come on. Come on. Let's move it. Come on.

01:10:04.020 --> 01:10:05.009
Come on.

01:10:12.762 --> 01:10:15.731
No! Wait. No!

01:10:29.212 --> 01:10:32.511
I hope my Hubie-boobie's behaving himself.

01:10:34.884 --> 01:10:36.181
Move!

01:10:49.032 --> 01:10:51.523
- Hollywood.
- Hollywood.

01:10:52.068 --> 01:10:55.504
What's so funny, huh?
What's so goddamned funny?

01:10:58.074 --> 01:11:00.376
- What...
- Dude, what a look.

01:11:00.476 --> 01:11:02.512
You got to show me how to do that.

01:11:02.612 --> 01:11:05.206
There. That's how to do it.

01:11:11.220 --> 01:11:12.482
Shirley!

01:11:13.222 --> 01:11:15.782
Shirley, behind the door.

01:11:16.025 --> 01:11:18.461
Can you hear me? Behind the door.

01:11:18.561 --> 01:11:19.892
Baba Rama.

01:11:20.530 --> 01:11:25.331
First the flowers
and now to hear your spirit voice.

01:11:26.869 --> 01:11:31.203
Shirley! Cut the bullshit
and open this door!

01:11:31.541 --> 01:11:32.633
Baba?

01:11:34.677 --> 01:11:36.144
Split up!

01:11:49.759 --> 01:11:52.626
Help! Help! Girls, girls.
There's a man in there.

01:11:59.635 --> 01:12:02.331
All right. This time you've gone too far.

01:12:02.438 --> 01:12:04.770
Oh, not you again.

01:12:14.750 --> 01:12:16.308
Get him, girls.

01:12:29.932 --> 01:12:30.967
Come on.

01:12:31.067 --> 01:12:32.728
- Where?
- Upstairs.

01:12:39.642 --> 01:12:42.076
So, the big lover
is a small time crook, huh?

01:12:55.391 --> 01:12:56.626
Hold it.

01:12:56.726 --> 01:12:57.954
There they go.

01:12:58.294 --> 01:12:59.362
Out of the way.

01:12:59.462 --> 01:13:01.293
Come on. Hey, you, come on.

01:13:10.073 --> 01:13:12.735
What are you doing?
You're gonna kill somebody.

01:13:12.976 --> 01:13:14.375
No kidding!

01:13:45.308 --> 01:13:48.411
Please, everyone, no need to panic.

01:13:48.511 --> 01:13:50.638
Everything is under control.

01:14:17.907 --> 01:14:18.896
Patti!

01:14:19.008 --> 01:14:22.178
- Leave me alone. We're through.
- No, let me explain what happened.

01:14:22.278 --> 01:14:23.905
I know exactly what...

01:14:25.181 --> 01:14:26.850
Patti! Patti!

01:14:26.950 --> 01:14:30.078
- Are you crazy? You'll get killed.
- What the hell are you doing?

01:14:36.192 --> 01:14:37.181
Ben!

01:14:40.763 --> 01:14:42.321
Ben, Ben.

01:14:42.599 --> 01:14:46.262
I'm so sorry. Say something, please.
Say something.

01:14:48.571 --> 01:14:49.936
I love you.

01:14:55.478 --> 01:14:59.244
Party's over, punk.
Come on, get up. Give me the diamond. Up.

01:14:59.749 --> 01:15:01.614
Come on. Let's go now.

01:15:02.218 --> 01:15:04.982
Let go of the diamond. Let's go now!

01:15:05.688 --> 01:15:07.986
Go ahead, you wanna dance, kid?

01:15:09.459 --> 01:15:11.427
Come on. Get over there.

01:15:12.695 --> 01:15:15.562
Good work, sir. You captured the crooks.

01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:19.298
My back, you moron.

01:15:19.502 --> 01:15:23.836
I'm sorry, sir, but don't worry.
I'll keep them covered.

01:15:25.541 --> 01:15:27.710
Dude. Dynamite move.

01:15:27.810 --> 01:15:29.779
This guy. How are you doing that?

01:15:29.879 --> 01:15:33.082
- All right, what's going on here?
- Everything's under control.

01:15:33.182 --> 01:15:34.484
These boys stole a diamond.

01:15:34.584 --> 01:15:36.553
Yes, that's right. They stole a diamond.

01:15:36.653 --> 01:15:38.288
- We did not.
- They didn't.

01:15:38.388 --> 01:15:39.522
Let's go, downtown.

01:15:39.622 --> 01:15:44.059
- Hold it. That man stole the diamond.
- Oh, no.

01:15:46.029 --> 01:15:48.395
- Grandmother? Grandmother!
- Wait a minute.

01:15:48.498 --> 01:15:52.332
Wait a minute. It's just...
Now, just take it easy, please.

01:15:52.502 --> 01:15:54.493
No, please. No, no, don't.

01:15:55.338 --> 01:15:58.205
My neck. My neck. My neck.

01:16:09.552 --> 01:16:10.780
Hubert.

01:16:12.755 --> 01:16:16.020
Hubert, honey. Honey...

01:16:17.093 --> 01:16:20.221
- Hubie-boobie.
- Don't call me that.

01:16:20.596 --> 01:16:22.723
Are you gonna be very long?

01:16:23.833 --> 01:16:25.824
That meter's ticking.

01:16:26.903 --> 01:16:27.961
Mike?

01:16:29.172 --> 01:16:30.907
A real grandma.

01:16:31.007 --> 01:16:34.244
Granny, you're gonna love this place.
It's Jamaica, it's a party city.

01:16:34.344 --> 01:16:35.445
You'll fit right in.

01:16:35.545 --> 01:16:38.514
Oh, I hope they have
this wonderful aspirin there.

01:16:38.614 --> 01:16:42.641
They've got boatloads and truckloads.
Believe me, more than your share.

01:16:42.819 --> 01:16:47.023
- I hope I'm not nuts quitting my job.
- What's a lousy job next to a great vacation?

01:16:47.123 --> 01:16:49.559
After all these vacations,
I'm gonna need a vacation.

01:16:49.659 --> 01:16:52.762
Okay, dudes. You ready to blast off?

01:16:52.862 --> 01:16:56.923
No, no, wait. We can't go yet.
Someone is missing.

01:16:59.202 --> 01:17:02.272
Dana, dear, where is your cousin Shirley?

01:17:02.372 --> 01:17:07.332
Be free with me, Raga Lama.
You must strive to be happy.

01:17:07.744 --> 01:17:08.878
Hey, I'm happy.

01:17:08.978 --> 01:17:12.880
No, that is not a happy body.

01:17:13.149 --> 01:17:17.017
Baby, if this isn't a happy body,
then my name isn't Big Rick.

01:17:17.353 --> 01:17:18.877
Check this out.

01:17:22.759 --> 01:17:26.661
You must remove
all your artificial layers.

01:17:31.768 --> 01:17:33.668
You asked for it, baby.

01:17:41.677 --> 01:17:43.941
Not in front of the Baba Rama.

01:17:44.614 --> 01:17:47.014
Shirley, what are you doing?

01:17:47.383 --> 01:17:49.919
I'm meditating.

01:17:50.019 --> 01:17:52.422
Well, come on dear. We're leaving now.

01:17:52.522 --> 01:17:55.358
Not now. I'm meditating.

01:17:55.458 --> 01:18:00.088
And you know that meditation
is the most important thing in my life!
