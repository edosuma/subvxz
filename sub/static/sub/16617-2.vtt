00:01.101 --> 00:02.935
<i>You're watching</i>
The Last Man on Earth.

00:02.937 --> 00:04.436
Yes!

00:04.438 --> 00:05.971
<i>Catch all-new episodes Sundays.</i>

00:05.973 --> 00:08.140
<i>And check out</i>
<i>our other Fox programs,</i>

00:08.142 --> 00:09.708
Bob's Burgers--
Whoo!

00:09.710 --> 00:11.977
Brooklyn Nine-Nine
<i>and</i> Family Guy.

00:11.979 --> 00:14.546
-Can me and Ramon
go ride shirtless bikes?
-(sighs)

00:14.548 --> 00:15.748
<i>Only on Fox.</i>

00:19.052 --> 00:20.886
<i>Previously on</i>
The Last Man on Earth...

00:20.888 --> 00:21.887
I am worried about Melissa.

00:21.889 --> 00:23.956
Hey, guys, how would
you like to stay?

00:23.958 --> 00:25.057
You're not gonna regret this.

00:25.059 --> 00:26.058
I know we won't.

00:26.060 --> 00:27.359
You lied!

00:27.361 --> 00:29.361
So you could
infect me with the virus!

00:29.363 --> 00:32.965
(all screaming and yelling)

00:32.967 --> 00:35.367
I think I killed him!
(all screaming)

00:36.236 --> 00:37.536
(screaming, overlapping yelling)

00:37.538 --> 00:39.538
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!

00:39.540 --> 00:40.739
I told you he was crazy.

00:40.741 --> 00:41.907
Oh, yeah,
Lewis, this isn't

00:41.909 --> 00:43.842
a "who-knew-who
was-crazy-when" contest.

00:43.844 --> 00:46.745
And if it was, I won
'cause I knew it all along.

00:46.747 --> 00:49.248
Oh, please, you could not
get his jeans on fast enough.

00:49.250 --> 00:51.550
I put them on very slowly,
Lewis.

00:51.552 --> 00:53.218
(car sputtering)
Hey, hey,
why are we slowing down?

00:53.220 --> 00:55.320
I'm flooring it.
Nothing's happening.
LEWIS:
It's the gas.

00:55.322 --> 00:56.355
Gas goes bad.

00:56.357 --> 00:58.557
Pull over.
We can hide in that house!

00:58.559 --> 01:00.659
(engine sputtering)

01:00.661 --> 01:03.162
(crickets chirping)

01:05.098 --> 01:07.166
Oh! Okay, get in!
Get in!
(gasps)

01:07.168 --> 01:08.500
(screams)
Okay. Okay. Okay.

01:08.502 --> 01:10.436
Tandy, close the door.
Help me with this.
Coming.

01:10.438 --> 01:12.004
All right.

01:12.006 --> 01:15.040
GAIL:
Oh... my... God.

01:15.042 --> 01:16.975
No way.
What?

01:18.711 --> 01:22.581
I think we might be
in Cher's house.

01:22.583 --> 01:23.749
Well, I don't know.

01:23.751 --> 01:25.684
It could be a fan
or a drag queen.

01:25.686 --> 01:29.955
Nope, this is definitely
Cher's house.

01:29.957 --> 01:32.091
(door squeaks)

01:35.428 --> 01:37.830
She still looks radiant.

01:39.299 --> 01:41.366
(sighs)

01:42.869 --> 01:44.703
I mean, I-I... I just grazed
him! I think I... It was just...

01:44.705 --> 01:47.139
It was just a tap. I mean,
Pat's gonna be fine, right?

01:47.141 --> 01:49.041
I definitely heard
bones breaking.

01:49.043 --> 01:50.209
I'm night blind,

01:50.211 --> 01:52.644
so I've run over
a lot of animals.

01:52.646 --> 01:54.413
Possums, coons,

01:54.415 --> 01:56.482
squirrels, dogs and
cats, of course,

01:56.484 --> 01:58.951
and one animal-- I never
knew what it was,

01:58.953 --> 02:00.385
but it yelled "Stop!"

02:00.387 --> 02:01.820
Might have been a parrot.

02:01.822 --> 02:03.088
TODD:
Yeah, so I'm thinking just maybe

02:03.090 --> 02:04.656
a couple broken bones, or...?

02:04.658 --> 02:06.125
Oh, no,
you hit him dead-on.

02:06.127 --> 02:07.593
I mean, we're talking
full on smush.

02:07.595 --> 02:09.728
Yeah, but, I mean,
he's gonna be fine, right?

02:09.730 --> 02:11.930
Oh, yeah, a lot of people
pull through situations

02:11.932 --> 02:13.832
where their intestines
shoot out their butts.

02:13.834 --> 02:15.400
Good God.
Todd,

02:15.402 --> 02:17.269
you should be hoping
you killed him,

02:17.271 --> 02:19.938
'cause if you didn't,
he'll be coming for us.

02:19.940 --> 02:23.408
And right on cue, the freakin'
peanut gallery opens his shell

02:23.410 --> 02:25.477
and shoots off
his little peanut mouth.

02:25.479 --> 02:26.845
Carol, what are you doing?

02:26.847 --> 02:29.414
I'm just having trouble
reading your emotions.

02:29.416 --> 02:30.816
(sighs)

02:30.818 --> 02:32.684
Oh, you're irritated.

02:32.686 --> 02:34.920
Okay, all I'm saying
with my little peanut mouth

02:34.922 --> 02:37.356
is that we need
to be very cautious here.

02:37.358 --> 02:38.757
Yeah, I'm with Lewis.

02:38.759 --> 02:41.160
Let's leave before
Pat comes back and kills us all,

02:41.162 --> 02:43.762
or makes us wear
those friggin' janky jeans.

02:43.764 --> 02:45.297
Okay, fine, since Lewis has

02:45.299 --> 02:47.432
everyone's panties
jumping up their buns,

02:47.434 --> 02:49.501
I'll go over there
and check it out.

02:49.503 --> 02:52.104
No way, Tandy!
What if they're right,

02:52.106 --> 02:54.873
and he makes us wear
the janky jeans?

02:54.875 --> 02:56.942
Look, I'll be very careful.

02:56.944 --> 02:59.211
You know me. I'm an expert
at sneaking around.

02:59.213 --> 03:01.613
Oh, my God, what's that?

03:08.721 --> 03:10.822
See?

03:10.824 --> 03:14.726
I'm gonna be just fine.

03:14.728 --> 03:16.895
TANDY:
<i>Pat?</i>

03:16.897 --> 03:18.797
It's me-- Tandy.

03:18.799 --> 03:20.365
Now, don't get any ideas!

03:20.367 --> 03:22.167
I'm not alone!

03:22.169 --> 03:25.571
I ran into some ex-Marines
and MMA fighters.

03:25.573 --> 03:27.372
Guys, introduce yourselves.

03:27.374 --> 03:30.542
(with Southern accent):
Hey, I'm Jed. Semper Fi!

03:30.544 --> 03:34.479
(different voice):
I'm CJ. Jujitsu is my game!

03:34.481 --> 03:36.715
(in deep voice):
Oh, hey, there. I'm Frisco.

03:36.717 --> 03:38.650
I'm a neck snapper!

03:38.652 --> 03:40.319
(in silly voice):
Oh, and hello.

03:40.321 --> 03:42.254
I am, uh, Julius.

03:42.256 --> 03:45.090
Uh, Semper Fi. Another marine.

03:45.092 --> 03:48.193
(in his voice):
Okay, Pat,
it's me again-- Tandy.

03:48.195 --> 03:50.095
Now, we're gonna come out.

03:50.097 --> 03:52.698
Don't try anything stupid, okay?

03:52.700 --> 03:54.433
We're all heavily armed.

03:54.435 --> 03:57.236
Okay, guys, single file.

04:02.942 --> 04:05.010
(crickets chirping)

04:08.348 --> 04:10.082
Pat?

04:11.784 --> 04:13.919
Bud?

04:17.857 --> 04:19.925
You okay?

04:21.794 --> 04:24.630
Pat?

04:24.632 --> 04:27.199
Taking a little snooze, huh?

04:29.302 --> 04:31.103
Pat?

04:31.105 --> 04:33.205
Watch out!

04:41.481 --> 04:43.649
(wind whistling)

04:43.651 --> 04:46.985
I guess I should probably
say a few words.

04:53.826 --> 04:55.994
Get your hat off!

04:59.799 --> 05:01.833
Wow.

05:01.835 --> 05:03.735
Pat, we had some good times,

05:03.737 --> 05:07.005
and then at the end there,
we had a really quick bad one

05:07.007 --> 05:08.340
that led to this.

05:08.342 --> 05:10.075
(wind whistling)

05:10.077 --> 05:12.010
But even though you turned into

05:12.012 --> 05:13.945
kind of a monster
there at the end,

05:13.947 --> 05:16.315
and, you know, you tried
to kill my brother,

05:16.317 --> 05:19.551
you still deserve
a proper burial.

05:21.487 --> 05:23.588
(glass breaking)

05:30.463 --> 05:33.131
Everybody here? If I could
get your attention.

05:33.133 --> 05:36.034
Uh, bring it in,
take a knee.

05:36.036 --> 05:40.372
Melissa? Melissa?

05:40.374 --> 05:41.273
Uh, thank you.

05:41.275 --> 05:43.041
Yeah.

05:43.043 --> 05:47.112
Got something I, uh...
I got to say.

05:49.048 --> 05:51.049
He dead.

05:51.051 --> 05:53.885
He dead?

05:53.887 --> 05:55.854
<i>He's</i> dead,
or he<i> died.</i>

05:55.856 --> 05:57.456
In times of grief,

05:57.458 --> 06:00.225
people often abandon
the rules of contraction.

06:01.194 --> 06:03.695
Oh, my God,
I killed someone.

06:03.697 --> 06:05.831
Hey, buck up, bud.

06:05.833 --> 06:07.499
You did the right thing.

06:07.501 --> 06:09.034
ERICA:
Yeah, you

06:09.036 --> 06:11.336
saved us from a ropeable psycho.
LEWIS:
Yeah.

06:11.338 --> 06:13.372
You're a hero, Todd.
He was a bad guy.

06:14.240 --> 06:16.141
I'm sorry.

06:16.143 --> 06:18.276
I'm gonna need...
need a minute.

06:20.146 --> 06:21.646
Oh, way to go, Lewis.

06:21.648 --> 06:23.081
Calling him a hero.

06:23.083 --> 06:25.317
Read the room, dude!

06:29.422 --> 06:31.656
(Todd crying)

06:31.658 --> 06:34.626
(weeping)

06:39.832 --> 06:42.267
(sobbing)

06:47.540 --> 06:50.175
Hey, bud.

06:50.177 --> 06:53.078
(sobbing)

06:53.080 --> 06:55.380
You're really
taking this hard.

06:55.382 --> 06:57.949
Tandy, I killed someone!

06:57.951 --> 06:59.951
That doesn't go away, man.

06:59.953 --> 07:03.054
This'll be with me for
the rest of my life.

07:03.056 --> 07:06.358
I'm not sure I know
how to live with this.

07:06.360 --> 07:08.059
Come on, Todd,
you don't mean that.

07:08.061 --> 07:09.761
I do!

07:09.763 --> 07:13.432
I don't know how
to live with this!

07:13.434 --> 07:15.500
(sobbing)

07:22.775 --> 07:24.409
(loud sobbing)

07:24.411 --> 07:26.445
Todd? Todd? Todd? Todd?

07:26.447 --> 07:28.447
Todd? Todd? Todd?

07:28.449 --> 07:30.215
What?
Todd?

07:30.217 --> 07:31.716
Huh?

07:31.718 --> 07:33.885
Pat is alive.

07:33.887 --> 07:36.121
What?
Yeah, he's alive.

07:36.123 --> 07:37.756
(sniffles)

07:37.758 --> 07:39.224
That can't be.

07:39.226 --> 07:41.626
Well, it-it... it be.

07:41.628 --> 07:43.728
But you told
everybody he was dead.

07:43.730 --> 07:46.331
Well, yeah, I told 'em
what they needed to hear.

07:46.333 --> 07:47.999
You know I do that
from time to time.

07:48.001 --> 07:49.501
I mean, how do you think
they'd feel if they knew

07:49.503 --> 07:52.904
some deranged maniac
was on the loose? Huh?

07:52.906 --> 07:55.073
So I didn't kill him?

07:55.075 --> 07:57.075
No. He's totally alive.

07:57.077 --> 07:59.311
In fact, he's moving around
better than I've ever seen him.

07:59.313 --> 08:01.313
Just, like, j...
hoppin' around, jumping around.

08:01.315 --> 08:03.448
I got to go talk to him.
Yeah. Oh, no,
no, no, no.

08:03.450 --> 08:06.685
That's a bad idea.
That's a bad idea. He's pissed.

08:06.687 --> 08:08.353
This is my mess,
and I got to clean it up.

08:08.355 --> 08:10.622
I'm gonna do it with
or without your blessing, okay?
No...

08:10.624 --> 08:12.757
(stammering):
Uh, uh, o-okay, okay,

08:12.759 --> 08:14.759
okay, yes, yes.
Okay, fine, fine.

08:14.761 --> 08:17.929
But let me go over there first,
okay? You know that

08:17.931 --> 08:19.464
Pat and I are buds,
so, uh, you know,

08:19.466 --> 08:22.701
maybe I can heat up the pool
a little before you dive in.

08:22.703 --> 08:24.603
Yeah, sure, okay.

08:25.538 --> 08:27.772
Hey, Todd?

08:28.774 --> 08:30.876
You feel better?

08:30.878 --> 08:32.210
(sniffles)

08:32.212 --> 08:34.546
You know,
this is gonna sound selfish,

08:34.548 --> 08:36.681
because Pat's alive

08:36.683 --> 08:39.317
and the group is in danger,

08:39.319 --> 08:41.219
but, yeah,

08:41.221 --> 08:43.788
I really do.

08:43.790 --> 08:45.457
Good, good.

08:45.459 --> 08:48.293
Okay, I'll be back very soon.

08:48.295 --> 08:51.530
And-and, Todd,
do not tell the others.

08:54.133 --> 08:58.803
<i>Pat? Pat, I'm here with Todd,</i>

08:58.805 --> 09:00.238
like I told you.

09:00.240 --> 09:03.008
He's here to apologize.

09:03.010 --> 09:06.111
Pat! Where'd you go off to, bud?

09:07.013 --> 09:09.114
Pat!

09:10.082 --> 09:13.151
Oh, good God.

09:16.889 --> 09:19.558
What the hell?

09:27.366 --> 09:29.334
I just talked to him,
like, an hour ago,

09:29.336 --> 09:31.169
and he seemed
to be cooling down.

09:31.171 --> 09:33.271
Something must've
set him off.

09:33.273 --> 09:35.840
So crazy.
I mean,

09:35.842 --> 09:37.042
what a difference
an hour makes.

09:37.044 --> 09:38.276
Heck, less than an hour.

09:38.278 --> 09:40.679
55 minutes.
Maybe even 50.

09:40.681 --> 09:43.682
(sighs)

09:48.454 --> 09:50.956
Paint's wet.

09:50.958 --> 09:55.594
Yep, definitely done
within the last hour.

09:58.965 --> 10:01.866
Looks like he lit
a little incense.

10:01.868 --> 10:04.302
What do these take, like,
an hour to burn?

10:04.304 --> 10:07.606
So it must've been lit,
like, 30 minutes ago.

10:07.608 --> 10:09.741
So recent.

10:09.743 --> 10:12.043
Tandy, look at these.

10:12.045 --> 10:15.714
Oh, my God,
let me see that.

10:16.716 --> 10:19.884
That ink's, like,
18, 20 minutes old.

10:19.886 --> 10:21.219
He was just here.

10:21.221 --> 10:24.122
Oh, damn it! What are
we gonna do about the others?

10:24.124 --> 10:26.625
What do you mean?
They're gonna want
to come back here.

10:26.627 --> 10:28.226
Eh, it's fine.
No, Tandy,

10:28.228 --> 10:30.829
there is a maniac on the loose,
and he is pissed at us.

10:30.831 --> 10:32.397
(stammering):
Yes, yeah, yeah, yeah.

10:32.399 --> 10:34.599
No, no, no, I see your point.
Yes, yes, yes.

10:34.601 --> 10:36.835
Okay. (stammers)
Uh, oh, how 'bout this, okay?

10:36.837 --> 10:38.837
We stay away for a few days.

10:38.839 --> 10:41.940
Right.
Maybe we'll get lucky and he'll,
you know, come back here

10:41.942 --> 10:44.142
and paint something on the wall
saying he sailed off to Hawaii.

10:44.144 --> 10:45.610
Wouldn't it be nice
if he did that?

10:45.612 --> 10:47.846
But, hey, what are the chances?
We'll see.

10:47.848 --> 10:50.515
How are we gonna keep 'em
from coming back here
without scaring 'em?

10:50.517 --> 10:53.385
Easy. Just follow my lead.

10:54.687 --> 10:56.454
Okay, guys, so,
uh, I took Todd over

10:56.456 --> 10:59.591
to see Pat's dead body.
You know, desensitize him.

10:59.593 --> 11:01.926
And it went great.
Right, T?

11:01.928 --> 11:03.428
Uh, yeah, you bet.

11:03.430 --> 11:05.196
Y-You know, I, uh...

11:05.198 --> 11:08.333
I-I looked at it, uh,
long enough to...

11:08.335 --> 11:10.669
feel better.

11:10.671 --> 11:12.203
Anyway, so I think
it might be best

11:12.205 --> 11:14.506
to just hunker down here
for the next few days.

11:14.508 --> 11:15.807
It's pretty gross over there.

11:15.809 --> 11:17.442
It's like a freakin' flock
of seals

11:17.444 --> 11:18.677
jumped into a wood chipper.

11:18.679 --> 11:20.045
I mean, like,
every inch

11:20.047 --> 11:21.880
of the place is coated
in blood and stool.

11:21.882 --> 11:22.847
Right, T?

11:22.849 --> 11:25.884
Yeah, blood, stool, vomit.

11:25.886 --> 11:27.385
Vomit. Forgot about the vomit.

11:27.387 --> 11:29.054
Semen.
I didn't see that.

11:29.056 --> 11:31.056
But, okay, yeah,
semen, sure.

11:31.058 --> 11:33.158
I don't care. I want to go home.
I know you do,

11:33.160 --> 11:35.126
Care Bear, but I'm gonna have
to insist that we stay.

11:35.128 --> 11:37.629
I'm making the call here.
LEWIS:
You know, Tandy,

11:37.631 --> 11:40.231
I think people can make
their own decisions.

11:40.233 --> 11:41.566
Is that so?

11:41.568 --> 11:42.634
Yep. I'm going back.

11:42.636 --> 11:44.536
That's my decision.
Yeah,

11:44.538 --> 11:47.005
I'm my own person, and I'm
going back if Gail goes back.

11:47.007 --> 11:48.139
Let's go.

11:48.141 --> 11:49.974
You're making
a big mistake.
No, guys!

11:49.976 --> 11:51.876
Please, don't-don't
go! Listen,

11:51.878 --> 11:53.144
Tandy, we got to tell 'em.

11:53.146 --> 11:54.646
Tell us what?

11:54.648 --> 11:56.214
Uh...
Tandy!

11:56.216 --> 11:58.249
(stammering)

11:58.251 --> 11:59.584
(exhales)

11:59.586 --> 12:01.052
(stammering)

12:02.421 --> 12:04.055
Tandy.

12:04.057 --> 12:06.257
(stammers)
Hmm.

12:06.259 --> 12:07.892
Guys...
(stammering)

12:07.894 --> 12:09.928
Pat is alive.

12:09.930 --> 12:10.829
What?
What?
(groans)

12:10.831 --> 12:11.596
But, Tandy,

12:11.598 --> 12:12.664
you told us he was dead!

12:12.666 --> 12:14.065
(stammering):
Guys, guys,

12:14.067 --> 12:15.934
guys, relax, okay?

12:15.936 --> 12:17.602
Pat is very dead.

12:17.604 --> 12:19.604
No, Tandy,

12:19.606 --> 12:20.905
we got to come clean.

12:20.907 --> 12:22.440
Listen, Tandy lied to you

12:22.442 --> 12:23.942
because he didn't
want to scare you.

12:23.944 --> 12:25.744
But the truth is
Pat is alive,

12:25.746 --> 12:27.178
and he is friggin'
pissed at us.

12:27.180 --> 12:29.547
Oh, Lord on high.
Oh...
(gasping)

12:29.549 --> 12:32.550
(stammering):
Fine, yes, yes, yes,

12:32.552 --> 12:34.919
w-we have to be honest, right?
Yes.

12:34.921 --> 12:37.388
Okay, and the truth is...

12:37.390 --> 12:39.257
Pat is alive.

12:40.459 --> 12:41.726
I don't understand
this game!

12:41.728 --> 12:43.294
Tandy, which is it?

12:43.296 --> 12:44.796
Pat is dead.

12:44.798 --> 12:47.165
What?
(whispering):
He's alive.

12:48.134 --> 12:49.634
He's-he's dead.

12:49.636 --> 12:51.770
He's alive.

12:52.938 --> 12:55.840
Philip Tandrew Miller,
is he alive or is he dead?

12:58.477 --> 13:00.378
Tandy?

13:04.216 --> 13:06.484
He's alive.

13:06.486 --> 13:07.886
Oh, bloody hell,
Tandy!

13:07.888 --> 13:10.655
God, what are we gonna do?
What are we gonna do?!

13:10.657 --> 13:12.891
(indistinct chatter)
We need weapons!

13:12.893 --> 13:14.826
(sighs heavily)

13:14.828 --> 13:16.394
Oh, farts.

13:20.833 --> 13:22.667
Grab Oscars, Emmys,
Grammys, Golden Globes!

13:22.669 --> 13:24.669
Anything that can
be turned into a shiv!

13:24.671 --> 13:26.137
TANDY:
Guys, come on,

13:26.139 --> 13:28.339
relax! I mean,
he's just one guy!

13:28.341 --> 13:31.743
Just one guy who wants to kill
us, you friggin' dingbat!

13:31.745 --> 13:33.344
He doesn't want to kill us.

13:33.346 --> 13:35.580
Tandy, he literally wrote
on the wall he wants

13:35.582 --> 13:37.916
to cut our heads off
and drink our blood!

13:37.918 --> 13:41.653
(hysterical screaming)

13:42.521 --> 13:44.989
Melissa?

13:47.760 --> 13:51.196
Melissa? What are
you doing up there?

13:51.198 --> 13:53.164
Oh, I'm just in Cher's tree

13:53.166 --> 13:56.501
throwing some of Cher's
bocce balls at Cher's vases.

13:58.103 --> 14:01.306
Okay, but, hon, I'm-I'm gonna
need you to come down,

14:01.308 --> 14:05.476
because it turns out
that Pat is way more alive

14:05.478 --> 14:08.513
than previously advertised.
Oh, really?

14:08.515 --> 14:10.548
Be right back.

14:10.550 --> 14:11.549
Wait, where you going?

14:11.551 --> 14:13.318
To kill him. Oh.

14:13.320 --> 14:15.053
I don't have a gun.

14:15.055 --> 14:16.387
Do you have a gun?
Melissa,

14:16.389 --> 14:17.822
are you okay?

14:17.824 --> 14:19.224
I'm fine.

14:19.226 --> 14:21.159
You know, I just
worry because

14:21.161 --> 14:23.228
it's only been two days since,
you know...

14:23.230 --> 14:25.063
Since I killed that guy?

14:25.065 --> 14:25.997
Yeah.

14:25.999 --> 14:27.966
Eh, well, don't worry about me.

14:27.968 --> 14:30.635
I can turn it off like a faucet.

14:30.637 --> 14:33.137
Just like a faucet.

14:35.040 --> 14:37.141
Carol?

14:46.151 --> 14:47.185
Tandy.

14:47.187 --> 14:48.086
(screams)

14:48.520 --> 14:50.421
(screaming)

14:50.423 --> 14:51.923
Carol, what are you doing?

14:51.925 --> 14:53.524
Oh, Tandy, I'm so scared.

14:53.526 --> 14:55.526
What if Pat comes here
and finds us?

14:55.528 --> 14:58.730
He's not going to.
You don't know that for sure.

14:58.732 --> 15:01.866
Yes, I do, okay?

15:01.868 --> 15:03.568
It's not possible.

15:03.570 --> 15:06.437
Anything's possible
if you put your mind to it.

15:06.439 --> 15:07.772
Not this time.

15:07.774 --> 15:09.807
Here, have a seat.

15:11.744 --> 15:14.779
Carol, Pat<i> is</i> dead.

15:14.781 --> 15:17.115
But... Well, you said
he was alive.

15:17.117 --> 15:20.785
Look, Todd was just so broken up
about the whole thing,

15:20.787 --> 15:22.287
I had to do something.

15:22.289 --> 15:23.922
So I lied to him.

15:25.524 --> 15:27.258
I'm so proud of you.

15:27.260 --> 15:29.093
I mean, you
blew it on many,

15:29.095 --> 15:32.130
many levels.

15:32.132 --> 15:35.033
But your intentions
were beyond heroic.

15:35.035 --> 15:36.701
But I created such a mess.

15:36.703 --> 15:39.404
I have no idea what to do now.

15:39.406 --> 15:41.739
Look, you created
a monster here.

15:41.741 --> 15:43.541
Yeah?

15:43.543 --> 15:46.778
So now you just have to kill it.

15:49.949 --> 15:51.649
Oh, good God.

15:51.651 --> 15:53.785
What, Tandy?

15:56.055 --> 15:57.622
Aah!

15:57.624 --> 16:00.458
Why God, why?!

16:00.460 --> 16:02.727
This ends now!

16:02.729 --> 16:04.228
(yelling)

16:04.230 --> 16:05.830
No, Tandy,

16:05.832 --> 16:07.465
don't be a hero.

16:07.467 --> 16:08.900
The baby.
What's going on?

16:08.902 --> 16:11.002
TODD: Tandy, where you going?
The baby!

16:11.004 --> 16:12.403
What's
going on?

16:12.405 --> 16:15.106
There, down at the beach.

16:15.108 --> 16:18.009
Pat's come for us,
like a bloodthirsty rat

16:18.011 --> 16:19.844
to his pied piper.

16:19.846 --> 16:22.180
But Tandy will save us.

16:22.182 --> 16:25.350
Be careful, my love.

16:25.352 --> 16:27.085
Tandy approaches.

16:27.087 --> 16:29.087
Pat is sadistically calm.

16:29.089 --> 16:31.189
Tandy suggests a truce.

16:31.191 --> 16:32.523
Okay, what the hell is this?

16:32.525 --> 16:34.192
Shh. Just let it play out.

16:34.194 --> 16:36.694
I like to see
where these things go.

16:36.696 --> 16:38.930
CAROL:
Diplomacy fails.

16:38.932 --> 16:41.766
Tandy delivers
a roundhouse kick to the face.

16:41.768 --> 16:45.103
Oh! That's got to sting.

16:45.105 --> 16:48.639
Tandy is going in for more.

16:48.641 --> 16:51.442
Body blow, body blow.
Left hook,

16:51.444 --> 16:53.378
uppercut, body blow!

16:53.380 --> 16:56.647
Wait, what's this? Tandy's
offering to spare Pat's life.

16:56.649 --> 16:58.616
He's extending his hand.

16:58.618 --> 17:00.118
What a gentleman.

17:00.120 --> 17:01.552
Oh, no.

17:01.554 --> 17:04.455
Oh, no! He's thrown Tandy
to the ground.

17:04.457 --> 17:06.791
An epic battle!

17:06.793 --> 17:08.626
The baby!

17:08.628 --> 17:10.561
Tandy, no!

17:10.563 --> 17:12.830
Use your strength!

17:12.832 --> 17:14.632
Pat's going for the eyes.

17:14.634 --> 17:16.300
He's poking Tandy's eyes.

17:16.302 --> 17:17.902
With what will he use

17:17.904 --> 17:20.171
to look at our
precious baby?

17:20.173 --> 17:22.240
Pat's on top.
Now Tandy's on top,

17:22.242 --> 17:24.475
and it looks like
he's there to stay.

17:24.477 --> 17:27.378
There will be
no mercy this time.

17:27.380 --> 17:29.480
Tandy grabs the hacksaw.

17:29.482 --> 17:31.315
He's gonna give it to Pat.

17:31.317 --> 17:33.184
He's gonna let Pat know

17:33.186 --> 17:36.654
that he will be judged
on a different plane.

17:36.656 --> 17:38.189
He's finishing him.

17:38.191 --> 17:41.392
So much blood, rivers of blood!

17:41.394 --> 17:44.429
Oh, there's no coming back
from this one, Pat.

17:44.431 --> 17:46.664
This is it for you, Pat.

17:46.666 --> 17:48.599
He's done it!

17:48.601 --> 17:51.502
Oh, God, yes!
He's done it!

17:53.005 --> 17:56.107
Pat's dead! Pat's dead.

17:56.109 --> 17:58.242
Aah!

18:06.852 --> 18:08.252
What the hell was that?

18:08.254 --> 18:10.288
Well, I think it was
pretty self-explanatory.

18:10.290 --> 18:11.522
I took care of beeswax.

18:11.524 --> 18:13.558
Three cheers for Tandy, huh?
Oh, Carol.

18:13.560 --> 18:15.359
Hip, hip, huzzah!
Huzzah!

18:15.361 --> 18:17.361
Hip, hip, huzzah! Join in,
Huzzah!

18:17.363 --> 18:18.863
join in.
Hip, hip,

18:18.865 --> 18:20.231
huzzah!
Huzzah.

18:20.233 --> 18:21.365
That was not Pat.

18:21.367 --> 18:22.800
Yeah, that was fake.

18:22.802 --> 18:24.869
How do you know?
GAIL: Pretty sure
Pat's body's

18:24.871 --> 18:26.471
not made of foam.

18:26.473 --> 18:28.973
We don't know everything
about everyone.

18:28.975 --> 18:30.741
Yeah, come on.
The threat is over.

18:30.743 --> 18:32.310
Now can we just move on?

18:32.312 --> 18:34.879
Damn it, Tandy,
I've had enough of this.

18:34.881 --> 18:36.380
And I've had enough of you.

18:36.382 --> 18:38.416
You shut the hell up!

18:38.418 --> 18:40.051
Just shut your stupid mouth

18:40.053 --> 18:42.553
and you listen to me
for a change!

18:42.555 --> 18:44.455
Do we look like idiots?

18:45.958 --> 18:48.426
Tandy.

18:48.428 --> 18:52.130
Do we look like idiots?

18:54.967 --> 18:56.167
No.

18:56.169 --> 18:58.469
Then why do you
treat us like idiots?

19:00.739 --> 19:02.340
Now, just know

19:02.342 --> 19:05.743
that we all already
know the answer to this.

19:05.745 --> 19:07.812
But I want
to hear you say it.

19:10.082 --> 19:12.483
Was that Pat?

19:14.186 --> 19:16.187
No.

19:16.189 --> 19:19.157
Is Pat alive?

19:20.425 --> 19:21.626
No.

19:21.628 --> 19:24.762
So what possible reason
do you have

19:24.764 --> 19:27.064
to lie to us like this?

19:32.538 --> 19:34.172
I killed him, didn't I?

19:51.390 --> 19:53.057
(sniffles)

19:53.059 --> 19:55.526
I didn't want you
to have to live with that.

20:00.199 --> 20:02.633
Thank you, buddy.

20:02.635 --> 20:05.403
That's the nicest thing
anybody's ever done for me.

20:29.895 --> 20:31.829
TANDY:
So, I really wanted you guys

20:31.831 --> 20:34.232
to feel the essence
of Pat here, you know?

20:34.234 --> 20:35.766
Get into his psyche.

20:35.768 --> 20:37.935
So this was
all you?

20:37.937 --> 20:39.103
Yeah.

20:39.105 --> 20:40.838
It's pretty good, huh?

20:40.840 --> 20:43.074
See, I even, uh, misspelled
the word "totally."

20:43.076 --> 20:45.009
Threw two Ls in there.
(scoffs)

20:45.011 --> 20:47.845
No, that's spelled correctly.
Huh.

20:47.847 --> 20:49.680
Tandy, did you
take a dump in the...

20:49.682 --> 20:50.915
Yeah.

20:50.917 --> 20:53.217
ERICA:
You know, Tandy,

20:53.219 --> 20:55.853
you could have just told Todd
you came back to the house,

20:55.855 --> 20:58.089
saw Pat alive, and
killed him yourself.

20:59.858 --> 21:01.792
Yeah.
How'd you get rid

21:01.794 --> 21:04.228
of the boat?
Did you sink it?

21:04.230 --> 21:06.931
What?

21:09.868 --> 21:11.602
Oh, my God.

21:20.579 --> 21:21.779
He gone.

21:52.077 --> 21:53.511
CHILDREN:
<i>Uncle Stinky.</i>

21:53.513 --> 21:55.079
(horn honking)
