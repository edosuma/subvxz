WEBVTT

00:08.604 --> 00:12.293
So, Rashad has 82 apples...

00:12.440 --> 00:16.531
and 12 friends...

00:16.680 --> 00:19.201
all of whom are hungry.

00:19.348 --> 00:21.971
And so he looks
carefully at his apples

00:22.118 --> 00:24.540
and sees
that seven have worms.

00:24.687 --> 00:27.575
Another 15 have gone rotten.

00:27.723 --> 00:28.944
But he wants to be fair

00:29.091 --> 00:32.214
and distribute all
the good apples equally.

00:32.360 --> 00:34.115
"Distribute"?

00:34.263 --> 00:35.450
Give out.

00:35.599 --> 00:38.688
Well, just say that, yo?

00:38.835 --> 00:40.132
Okay.

00:47.143 --> 00:50.966
Okay, so how many apples
does each of Rashad's friends get:

00:51.114 --> 00:54.537
A, 4; B, 5;

00:54.685 --> 00:58.140
C, 6; or D, 7?

00:58.289 --> 00:59.810
Take your time,
but do it fast.

00:59.957 --> 01:03.412
Hey. Nigger said,
"l got my rights,"

01:03.560 --> 01:06.016
so my boy said,
"Oh, yeah?

01:06.164 --> 01:08.150
Well, he's got a left
to go with your right. "

01:08.299 --> 01:09.424
He was like, pow!

01:11.435 --> 01:13.790
- Calvin, you are done already?
- Uh-huh.

01:13.938 --> 01:16.771
- Yeah?
- B, 5.

01:17.809 --> 01:19.563
How did you work
that out so fast?

01:19.711 --> 01:22.233
Easy.
"B, 5" got the dinks.

01:22.380 --> 01:25.402
- The what?
- If you want, I could show you.

01:25.550 --> 01:27.770
Don't show him,
show me.

01:27.919 --> 01:30.251
All right.

01:31.522 --> 01:34.978
You did this with
the earlier math class, right?

01:35.127 --> 01:38.883
So, you, like,
got 82 apples...

01:39.031 --> 01:41.686
12 niggers...

01:41.833 --> 01:43.721
and then how many
blah, blah, blah--

01:43.868 --> 01:44.956
then you went, like,

01:45.103 --> 01:47.426
dinking all round this one
and no other one.

01:47.573 --> 01:49.794
So, answer is "B, 5."

01:49.942 --> 01:50.961
Everybody get that?

01:51.109 --> 01:52.195
Yeah.

01:52.343 --> 01:54.699
"B, 5,"
it got all the dinks.

01:54.846 --> 01:58.647
"B, 5,"
I'm an Audi 5000.

02:00.000 --> 02:06.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:41.456 --> 03:43.244
The priority should
be on making sure

03:43.391 --> 03:46.279
the age files are up to date
with all notes transcribed,

03:46.427 --> 03:49.383
the standard office report.

03:49.531 --> 03:51.117
Uh...

03:51.266 --> 03:54.088
on our day shift today,
you may encounter

03:54.235 --> 03:58.792
Councilman and Democratic
mayoral nominee Thomas Carcetti,

03:58.940 --> 04:02.295
who's been fact-finding
within the department.

04:02.443 --> 04:04.598
So, if you go
leaving your fax

04:04.747 --> 04:09.336
Iying around and he finds them,
that shit's on you.

04:09.484 --> 04:11.071
Lastly...

04:11.219 --> 04:13.942
as most of you
are already aware,

04:14.089 --> 04:16.944
our ClD Commander
Raymond Foerster,

04:17.093 --> 04:18.612
after a long bout
with cancer,

04:18.760 --> 04:21.583
passed away last night
at Johns Hopkins.

04:21.732 --> 04:23.528
Ahem.

04:24.833 --> 04:27.155
Better eulogies are coming.

04:27.302 --> 04:29.391
So, let me just say

04:29.538 --> 04:33.062
that the man
served 39 years--

04:33.209 --> 04:35.697
attaining the rank
of colonel--

04:35.845 --> 04:40.469
without leaving a trail
of bitterness or betrayal.

04:40.617 --> 04:44.609
In this department,
that's not a career, it's a miracle.

04:47.123 --> 04:49.178
There'll be a detective's
wake this evening

04:49.326 --> 04:51.647
followed by viewings
on Wednesday

04:51.795 --> 04:55.451
and a burial mass on Friday.

04:55.598 --> 04:57.753
The family suggests donations

04:57.900 --> 04:59.955
to the colonel's
favorite charities.

05:00.102 --> 05:02.390
The addresses will be posted
in the coffee room.

05:02.538 --> 05:05.027
All told.

05:05.175 --> 05:07.730
And, Bunk, I just got
your overtime for the week.

05:07.878 --> 05:09.937
Get down to my office
and pull your pants down.

05:12.483 --> 05:13.814
Mm-hmm.

05:29.833 --> 05:31.287
No no no!
Fuck that.

05:31.436 --> 05:34.690
You've finished your pot,
you make the next one.

05:34.838 --> 05:36.897
Okay.

05:42.480 --> 05:45.176
I don't see the right
one in here anyway.

05:46.651 --> 05:49.374
- Sergeant Hauk.
- Yes, sir.

05:49.520 --> 05:51.542
I just got off
with Beauford at lAD.

05:51.688 --> 05:54.177
He tells me there's a harassment
complaint been filed.

05:54.325 --> 05:56.113
Some Jamaican woman
says you had her stopped

05:56.262 --> 05:58.850
and searched
by Amtrak police.

05:58.997 --> 06:00.884
Yeah. Well, you see,
in my report,

06:01.032 --> 06:03.120
we had what we thought
was reliable info

06:03.268 --> 06:06.391
that she was a drug courier
for Marlo Stanfield.

06:06.538 --> 06:09.527
I mean, we actually scoped
Stanfield with her.

06:09.674 --> 06:12.495
What was the info?

06:12.644 --> 06:14.965
The Cl's been reliable.

06:15.114 --> 06:17.167
Great track record
with us.

06:17.316 --> 06:18.668
Long history.

06:18.816 --> 06:21.972
Cl 238.
Give me his name.

06:22.121 --> 06:24.610
His name? Sir.

06:24.757 --> 06:25.943
Sir!

06:26.090 --> 06:28.479
I've never been comfortable
with, you know,

06:28.627 --> 06:32.016
tossing around names
of informants in squad rooms.

06:32.164 --> 06:33.051
I feel that it's--

06:33.198 --> 06:35.825
- Name.
- Fuzzy Dunlop, sir.

06:38.904 --> 06:40.826
I might have to set up a meeting
with this character.

06:40.973 --> 06:42.693
He's kind of leery of meets.

06:42.842 --> 06:44.430
He's been reliable,
I promise you.

06:44.577 --> 06:46.965
I mean, this one baffled
the shit out of me, too.

06:47.112 --> 06:50.102
But he's never
been off, never.

06:50.250 --> 06:53.238
You jumped out
on bad information, Sergeant.

06:53.385 --> 06:55.072
You brought in
another agency,

06:55.220 --> 06:57.142
and you brought
discredit to this unit--

06:57.290 --> 06:59.011
my unit.

06:59.159 --> 07:00.945
In good faith though, sir.

07:01.094 --> 07:03.581
Anything comes of this,

07:03.729 --> 07:04.817
I have your report,

07:04.965 --> 07:06.865
and I will bury you with it.

07:12.139 --> 07:13.959
And in case
you haven't been

07:14.108 --> 07:16.229
paying attention
to the election results,

07:16.376 --> 07:19.242
your rabbi has
left the building.

07:25.386 --> 07:27.673
- No tantrums today?
- What's the point?

07:27.821 --> 07:29.775
They're not even gonna
suspend us, right?

07:29.923 --> 07:32.045
Right.
What's the point?

07:32.193 --> 07:35.148
So, we're here,
like it or not.

07:35.295 --> 07:36.615
If it makes you all
feel any better,

07:36.764 --> 07:38.017
the word around school is

07:38.164 --> 07:39.919
you're down here because
you beat the system.

07:40.067 --> 07:41.921
You had no interest
in being in a classroom,

07:42.070 --> 07:44.691
and you made the classroom
impossible for everybody else,

07:44.838 --> 07:46.860
and now you are out.
You won.

07:47.008 --> 07:50.330
- Ha ha. Yeah!
- You feel like winners?

07:50.478 --> 07:52.298
- Always.
- That's how we did.

07:52.446 --> 07:54.501
Who's we?

07:54.649 --> 07:57.004
- Us.
- No, who are you?

07:57.153 --> 07:59.138
- Players.
- Kingpins?

07:59.286 --> 08:01.040
Nah, that comes later.

08:01.188 --> 08:02.709
Right now, we are
just corner boys.

08:02.857 --> 08:04.779
So, how long until
you are kingpins?

08:04.925 --> 08:07.180
I am thinking
two, three years.

08:07.329 --> 08:10.184
Two, three years.

08:10.331 --> 08:12.620
Let me ask, and I want everybody
to write this down--

08:12.767 --> 08:15.895
where do you see
yourself in 10 years?

08:17.205 --> 08:18.458
Come on,
pencil and paper.

08:18.607 --> 08:20.631
This isn't schoolwork,
this is about y'all.

08:23.045 --> 08:24.532
She's young
but she's good.

08:24.680 --> 08:27.301
Yeah, a doctoral candidate
from the psych department

08:27.449 --> 08:28.902
of College Park.

08:29.051 --> 08:32.908
Thesis work is on social
alienation and analysis.

08:33.056 --> 08:34.642
All right, show of hands,

08:34.789 --> 08:36.143
how many wrote "NBA"?

08:36.291 --> 08:38.679
Yeah, but only
for the Lakers though.

08:38.827 --> 08:40.649
I want to be
a pediatric neurosurgeon

08:40.797 --> 08:42.982
Iike that one nigga,
what's his name?

08:43.131 --> 08:45.153
- Ben Carson.
- Yeah, that dude.

08:45.299 --> 08:46.922
He's a black surgeon at Hopkins
with a lot of profile.

08:47.069 --> 08:49.024
You want to be a surgeon,
you need to go to medical school.

08:49.173 --> 08:51.593
Whatever.

08:51.740 --> 08:53.228
How many wrote
down "dead"?

08:53.375 --> 08:55.696
Shit, you saw
that coming, huh?

08:55.844 --> 08:57.299
It's a shame
you all have so little time,

08:57.447 --> 08:58.900
and you're wasting it
here with us.

08:59.048 --> 09:00.869
You know where
you're going.

09:01.017 --> 09:03.104
We can't teach you anything
you don't know about that, right?

09:03.251 --> 09:04.204
That's what
we've been saying.

09:04.352 --> 09:06.442
Namond,
put away the magazine.

09:06.590 --> 09:08.310
I ain't reading
no magazine.

09:08.458 --> 09:10.077
- Namond.
- What?

09:10.226 --> 09:11.680
It ain't even mine.

09:11.828 --> 09:13.749
It was laying here
when I came in.

09:13.897 --> 09:16.126
Y'all little pissers.

09:18.836 --> 09:22.558
You know, we are giving
them a fine education.

09:22.706 --> 09:24.193
"lt ain't even mine.

09:24.340 --> 09:26.629
It was just laying here
when I came in."

09:26.777 --> 09:28.064
You know
this right here--

09:28.212 --> 09:29.664
the whole damn school--

09:29.813 --> 09:31.534
the way they carry themselves,

09:31.682 --> 09:34.203
it's training
for the street.

09:34.351 --> 09:36.972
The building's the system,
we the cops.

09:37.121 --> 09:38.840
Yeah, you are for sure.

09:38.990 --> 09:41.177
I mean, you'll come
in here every day

09:41.325 --> 09:43.012
and practice getting over,

09:43.160 --> 09:44.914
try running all
different kinds of games.

09:45.062 --> 09:46.948
You know, it's practice
for the corner, right?

09:47.097 --> 09:49.920
Ain't no real cops.
Ain't no real danger.

09:50.067 --> 09:52.422
But you'll all getting
something out of this.

09:52.570 --> 09:54.190
Bet you didn't
even know that.

09:54.339 --> 09:57.260
Still I'd rather
be out there.

09:57.407 --> 10:00.796
Can l?
Corner boys, huh?

10:00.945 --> 10:02.398
Let me ask
y'all something.

10:02.546 --> 10:04.067
You know, you help us
hone in on this,

10:04.215 --> 10:06.336
and maybe we do
a little better job with you in here.

10:06.484 --> 10:08.338
- What makes a good corner boy?
- Keep your eyes open.

10:08.487 --> 10:10.511
- Keep the count straight.
- Don't trust nobody.

10:17.227 --> 10:19.016
If you stupid in the hood,
you get killed.

10:19.163 --> 10:20.825
That's the only way.

10:22.501 --> 10:23.520
And I am telling you,

10:23.668 --> 10:25.822
this name in black right
here got stink on it.

10:25.970 --> 10:27.056
Eyeball witness, Bunk.

10:27.205 --> 10:28.859
Vernon, at least go back
to the scene with me

10:29.007 --> 10:31.562
- and take a fresh look.
- You're out of line here, Bunk.

10:31.709 --> 10:32.629
You are.

10:32.778 --> 10:35.532
A lot of names.
Too many.

10:35.681 --> 10:37.875
No, we're good with it.

10:54.066 --> 10:56.355
Listen, you back-seat-
driving motherfucker,

10:56.503 --> 10:59.257
the guy picked him out--
Omar-fucking-Little.

10:59.405 --> 11:01.225
Why he picked him out?
Who the fuck cares?

11:01.372 --> 11:03.527
We got a dead female
taxpayer on our hands,

11:03.676 --> 11:05.764
- and somebody's saying him.
- I don't buy.

11:05.912 --> 11:07.866
And look who you talking about.
This ain't the motherfucker

11:08.014 --> 11:10.201
that came up with
62 ways for the peanut.

11:10.350 --> 11:13.605
His name pops up on five
or six cases I know of--

11:13.753 --> 11:16.575
including two of yours-- and you want
to put him back on the street?

11:16.722 --> 11:18.376
But this ain't him.

11:18.524 --> 11:20.345
That means someone else
is walking on you all.

11:20.492 --> 11:21.713
Let me tell you
something, Bunk:

11:21.861 --> 11:23.115
the next body you catch,

11:23.263 --> 11:25.216
I'm going to be
crawling all over it,

11:25.365 --> 11:27.218
second-guessing
your ass every step,

11:27.367 --> 11:30.723
pulling on every last
motherfucking thread.

11:30.871 --> 11:33.704
Yeah. We going to see
how you like it.

11:38.612 --> 11:39.599
Hey, Vernon.

11:39.747 --> 11:41.834
Vernon, Vernon,
Vernon, Vernon.

11:41.982 --> 11:43.802
- Just go back on it with me.
- What?

11:43.950 --> 11:46.672
Shit doesn't play out
any differently...

11:46.820 --> 11:49.289
I'll give you a back rub that
you ain't never going to forget.

11:53.560 --> 11:55.289
Ahem.

12:06.173 --> 12:08.361
You know, you guys don't
need to do anything

12:08.509 --> 12:10.739
you wouldn't normally do
just 'cause I'm here.

12:14.682 --> 12:18.208
I wouldn't know what we
normally do around here.

12:21.288 --> 12:23.910
I'm new
and inexperienced.

12:24.059 --> 12:26.646
Oh, you're...

12:26.795 --> 12:29.315
Yeah. I am.

12:29.463 --> 12:31.451
Seriously, I'm just
trying to get a feel

12:31.600 --> 12:33.788
for the department's
response to the violence.

12:33.936 --> 12:35.995
I'm not the hall monitor
or anything.

13:04.267 --> 13:05.821
So, this is your day?

13:05.969 --> 13:08.590
We catch a body,
it's different.

13:08.737 --> 13:11.001
Mmm!

13:33.329 --> 13:35.150
I believe
you got my camera?

13:35.298 --> 13:37.419
- I what?
- License and registration.

13:37.566 --> 13:40.890
You do me one,
I'll do you.

13:41.038 --> 13:42.470
You got a card
or something?

13:50.446 --> 13:52.134
City, huh?

13:52.282 --> 13:54.502
Video camera
gotta come back.

13:54.651 --> 13:58.241
Yeah, well, I see what
I can find out about it.

13:58.388 --> 14:00.009
But you know cameras--

14:00.157 --> 14:01.810
kind of like pigeons
in the storm.

14:01.959 --> 14:04.279
You know
what I'm saying?

14:04.428 --> 14:06.419
Sometimes they come back.
Sometimes...

14:08.098 --> 14:10.293
But I keep an ear
out on it.

14:15.607 --> 14:18.295
Hey, Jim,
he just say pigeons?

14:18.442 --> 14:19.695
He's fucking with you.

14:19.843 --> 14:21.097
Look, you just got
to tell Marimow

14:21.245 --> 14:23.433
that you used the camera
for the PC at the train station.

14:23.581 --> 14:25.268
And then just admit
the camera got took.

14:25.416 --> 14:27.303
I already put it
down to the Cl.

14:27.452 --> 14:29.472
I tell dickhead the truth,

14:29.621 --> 14:32.242
- he takes my stripes on it.
- Oh, come on.

14:32.390 --> 14:35.379
Look, I'm just saying
you weren't suspended that long.

14:35.527 --> 14:37.580
Is it because
Tiff dropped it,

14:37.728 --> 14:39.650
or because you had to do
something for Miss Donnelly?

14:39.798 --> 14:42.151
- Do something?
- I don't know,

14:42.300 --> 14:44.620
Iike promise or something.

14:44.769 --> 14:46.089
No, Tiff dropped it,
so it's dropped.

14:46.236 --> 14:48.025
Ain't nothing past that.

14:48.173 --> 14:51.128
That's good. You know,
the thing with the teachers

14:51.276 --> 14:53.463
and cops and whatnot,
they always come at you

14:53.612 --> 14:55.799
Iike think they got you
by the ass.

14:55.947 --> 14:57.301
But you keep
your mouth shut,

14:57.450 --> 14:59.737
ain't nothing
they could do.

14:59.884 --> 15:02.506
So, more times than not,
they go away.

15:02.653 --> 15:04.053
Word on that.

15:05.658 --> 15:07.712
I mean, it don't even matter.
And Miss Anna...

15:07.859 --> 15:09.647
she got me on this
short leash right now.

15:09.795 --> 15:13.584
Can't go out the house unless
she know right where I'm going.

15:13.732 --> 15:15.927
Shit, at least
you've got a leash.

16:27.708 --> 16:30.062
Dewey!

16:30.210 --> 16:32.399
What the fuck is that?

16:32.548 --> 16:33.867
Club soda...

16:34.015 --> 16:35.735
and lime.

16:35.882 --> 16:37.704
Omissive bitch.

16:37.852 --> 16:40.912
Why not just suck a dick
and get it over with?

16:43.991 --> 16:46.246
That will get the bad
taste out of your mouth.

16:46.394 --> 16:47.794
Ah.

16:49.430 --> 16:50.954
Yeah.

17:19.127 --> 17:20.648
Almost new.

17:20.795 --> 17:22.617
Don't wear
no dead man's hat.

17:22.765 --> 17:25.018
I'm just fuckin'
with you.

17:25.166 --> 17:26.487
Here, let's pray.

17:26.636 --> 17:29.857
Here we lay a couple
of New York boys

17:30.004 --> 17:33.628
who came too far south
for their own fuckin' good.

17:33.775 --> 17:37.302
Fucking Yankee proud of it now,
you fuckin' bitches.

17:40.350 --> 17:42.214
Let's get the fuck
out of here.

17:49.126 --> 17:51.513
You hungry?

17:51.661 --> 17:53.492
You want some Chinese?

17:56.533 --> 17:58.659
No talking.

18:00.937 --> 18:02.962
Keep your eyes
on your paper.

18:09.612 --> 18:11.265
Yo, Mr. Prezbo,
this say "cars."

18:11.414 --> 18:12.767
- So?
- All the stuff we did in practice

18:12.915 --> 18:14.237
was about food.

18:14.385 --> 18:16.806
It's okay. It's just
a different object.

18:16.953 --> 18:18.741
Pay attention
to the number.

18:18.888 --> 18:20.108
Numbers are
messed up, too.

18:20.257 --> 18:21.676
We never did one-thirds.

18:21.824 --> 18:24.914
It's the same operation--
1/4, 1/5, 1/3.

18:25.062 --> 18:27.382
Follow the same steps.
It's just a different denominator.

18:27.531 --> 18:29.619
How do you get
1/3 of a car?

18:29.767 --> 18:31.822
It's actually
1/3 of all the cars.

18:31.969 --> 18:33.994
Was I talking to you?!

18:38.842 --> 18:41.198
You get close enough...

18:41.345 --> 18:45.112
you could take
a headshot. Why?

18:46.618 --> 18:49.071
'Cause maybe
he vested up.

18:49.220 --> 18:52.450
Word. A chest shot
maybe won't do it for you.

18:54.692 --> 18:56.380
Then what? You.

18:56.528 --> 18:59.483
- It's his turn.
- Thug, you on it.

18:59.631 --> 19:01.818
You gotta shoot
from a distance,

19:01.965 --> 19:03.453
you can't risk
a headshot.

19:03.600 --> 19:07.024
You go for the belly,
the dick or the ass area.

19:07.172 --> 19:11.060
Because the vest don't
go down that far.

19:11.209 --> 19:13.530
Bam! Take them out.

19:13.678 --> 19:16.166
- Then what?
- Walk up,

19:16.314 --> 19:18.803
- finish them off.
- With a...?

19:18.950 --> 19:20.937
Headshot.

19:21.086 --> 19:23.707
Damn, y'all coming
along full effect.

19:23.856 --> 19:25.914
I hear it--
I hear that.

19:28.660 --> 19:30.214
All right,
now say he in a car.

19:30.361 --> 19:34.619
Sergeant Thomas Hauk,
Baltimore City Police.

19:34.766 --> 19:36.853
Didn't I say City
would come running?

19:37.001 --> 19:40.024
- Did.
- I'll check this joker out for you.

19:40.173 --> 19:42.293
See what's what.

19:42.441 --> 19:44.362
One other thing,

19:44.510 --> 19:45.929
you're are doing
okay running them

19:46.077 --> 19:48.767
New York niggers
of off East Side. I know that.

19:48.914 --> 19:52.036
But this thing you got
with disappearing the bodies...

19:52.184 --> 19:55.607
My man is saying if you just
vanishing the bodies like that,

19:55.754 --> 19:58.911
it do kind of defeats
its own purpose.

19:59.059 --> 20:00.745
Niggers don't know
if they went back

20:00.893 --> 20:03.281
to the Bronx
or whatever.

20:03.428 --> 20:05.751
- You feel me?
- Of course.

20:05.898 --> 20:07.319
I'll tell my people.

20:07.467 --> 20:10.288
Hey, no disrespect to your
professionalism or nothing.

20:10.436 --> 20:11.889
We all impressed how you

20:12.037 --> 20:14.093
Iose the motherfuckers
like that.

20:14.241 --> 20:15.327
We just trying
to send a message

20:15.475 --> 20:19.697
to these New York people
in full effect...

20:19.846 --> 20:21.800
you know
what I'm saying?

20:21.947 --> 20:23.506
I'll get back
to you on this.

20:38.532 --> 20:39.585
So, Councilman,

20:39.734 --> 20:41.654
I understand you were
a ClD yesterday.

20:41.802 --> 20:43.389
See anything big
with those downtown boys?

20:43.538 --> 20:45.224
Well, they messed up
the lunch order.

20:45.373 --> 20:46.492
No, I figured
I needed to get closer

20:46.640 --> 20:48.093
to the street, so that's
why I am out here today.

20:48.242 --> 20:50.163
Rolling with the mighty
is east of the east.

20:50.311 --> 20:52.898
Now, remember, we had
a shooting incident last week.

20:53.047 --> 20:55.769
So, keep those corner fucks
to one window. Don't get surrounded.

20:55.916 --> 20:57.837
Shit, remember we had
a van full of you guys,

20:57.986 --> 20:59.906
- we'd find the fucking chap.
- What the fuck you say?

21:00.054 --> 21:01.841
Dressed like that,
Stevie Wonder make you as police.

21:01.988 --> 21:04.710
Keep your radio out of sight.
Volume up on those boom boxes.

21:04.858 --> 21:06.780
10 bucks say
we collar up first.

21:06.928 --> 21:08.280
20 makes
it worth our while.

21:08.429 --> 21:10.450
Mr. Mayor, you know what's great
about the Easter?

21:10.598 --> 21:11.951
We are hungry motherfuckers--

21:12.099 --> 21:13.386
respectfully, I mean.

21:13.534 --> 21:15.056
So, you're saying,

21:15.203 --> 21:18.158
you don't ever give
anybody a break?

21:18.306 --> 21:19.993
- Anybody?
- Nah nah.

21:20.141 --> 21:21.961
'cause if you let him
slide for a dollar,

21:22.110 --> 21:23.431
it's a sign
that you're weak.

21:23.578 --> 21:25.032
Today's dollar
is tomorrow's two.

21:25.180 --> 21:27.467
Yeah, same with your crew.
Your boy come up short

21:27.616 --> 21:29.570
saying spillage
or police or whatever,

21:29.717 --> 21:32.473
you let him be, and then
he gettin' over on you.

21:32.621 --> 21:34.741
- Then you a chump.
- So, you got to fuck him up.

21:34.890 --> 21:37.812
- Yeah.
- You gotta, ahem, mess him up.

21:37.960 --> 21:40.915
Nah nah. Something for real
happen, you do that.

21:41.063 --> 21:42.516
If you do it over
some bullshit,

21:42.664 --> 21:44.452
then all you did
was lose a good worker.

21:44.601 --> 21:45.686
Oh, no.

21:45.835 --> 21:48.668
Man, you gotta fuck
that nigger up, man.

21:53.242 --> 21:56.365
Whoa whoa whoa whoa!

21:56.512 --> 21:58.300
Whoa!

21:58.448 --> 22:01.136
Stop talking
on top of each other.

22:01.284 --> 22:03.571
This how you communicate
out on them streets?

22:03.719 --> 22:07.042
All right, it's like this:
you boy come back to you,

22:07.189 --> 22:09.945
- say this happened, that happened--
- Then you fuck him up.

22:10.093 --> 22:13.013
In my mind, I'm gonna let him
make it out of his own cut, too.

22:13.161 --> 22:15.217
If he good worker,
he know what he need to do.

22:15.365 --> 22:17.085
Yeah, he got a point.

22:17.233 --> 22:20.454
He got a point.
That's a good one.

22:20.603 --> 22:21.857
If he thinks about it,

22:22.004 --> 22:23.393
says it ain't his fault,

22:23.540 --> 22:25.294
then that nigger
run a game on you.

22:25.441 --> 22:27.027
And then you fuck
that nigger up.

22:27.176 --> 22:30.197
- Yeah.
- All right, yeah.

22:30.346 --> 22:32.934
- But why?
- You know it gotta happen, man.

22:33.083 --> 22:34.903
You know

22:35.051 --> 22:36.772
Wait wait wait!
One voice. One voice.

22:36.921 --> 22:39.442
- Y'all, one voice.
- Yo, yo, D, you tell him.

22:39.589 --> 22:41.176
There always
people watching.

22:41.325 --> 22:42.411
Watching... you.

22:42.560 --> 22:45.047
True. Yeah.

22:45.194 --> 22:46.948
What's taking you boys
so long?

22:47.096 --> 22:48.251
There he is now.

22:48.399 --> 22:50.219
Hurry up,

22:50.367 --> 22:52.588
This guy right here.

22:52.736 --> 22:55.057
Fuck you, guys.
Hey, yo, yo.

23:01.377 --> 23:04.167
Yo, 20 for the pills

23:04.315 --> 23:06.736
- Leave the bike.
- What, you want steal my bike?

23:06.884 --> 23:07.904
What the fuck
I want your bike for?

23:08.053 --> 23:09.940
I got a car.

23:10.087 --> 23:11.952
Give me a minute.

23:15.294 --> 23:17.314
$20 might not mean
nothing to you.

23:17.461 --> 23:19.849
But I ain't making
that much money.

23:19.997 --> 23:22.820
It's hard money.

23:22.969 --> 23:24.254
Y'all some
lazy motherfuckers.

23:24.401 --> 23:25.556
This shit is right
around the corner.

23:25.704 --> 23:27.591
You have no idea how much
we appreciate this.

23:27.738 --> 23:30.571
I love it when they come
to work pumped like this.

23:34.045 --> 23:36.433
Shit.

23:36.581 --> 23:38.435

23:38.582 --> 23:40.271
Come on, man.

23:40.418 --> 23:41.439

23:41.586 --> 23:43.107
This is some bullshit

23:43.253 --> 23:45.976
For real! For real! I ain't got

23:46.123 --> 23:48.780

This is fucked up

24:01.506 --> 24:05.230
Andre, how you doing?

24:05.379 --> 24:07.266
This is a friend of mine--
Detective Moreland.

24:07.413 --> 24:09.834
Hey.

24:09.981 --> 24:13.606
You doing okay there

24:13.754 --> 24:16.241
So, listen, for my friend here,

24:16.389 --> 24:18.042
how the thing went down,
will you?

24:18.190 --> 24:21.044
- The boy came in.
- Omar?

24:21.193 --> 24:24.449
- Omar.
- He puts the nine on her.

24:24.598 --> 24:26.485
Says to me,
"Whatever you got."

24:26.632 --> 24:28.052
Mm-hmm.

24:28.200 --> 24:30.788
A nine, huh?

24:30.937 --> 24:32.458
Where were you?

24:32.606 --> 24:35.700
- Where you see me at.
- Mm-hmm.

24:37.544 --> 24:39.932
Nine wouldn't
go through this.

24:40.080 --> 24:42.568
- Why did you come out?
- 'Cause he said to.

24:42.716 --> 24:44.436
Trying to save her life.

24:44.583 --> 24:45.904
Right, I'm saying---

24:46.053 --> 24:48.842
This is like
Bank of England glass.

24:48.989 --> 24:52.077
Fort Knox glass.

24:52.225 --> 24:55.079
And who put that
up there? Huh?

24:55.228 --> 24:59.351
Guy must have had
an elephant gun or some shit.

24:59.499 --> 25:02.263
I don't know.
The boy had a mask on.

25:04.104 --> 25:06.225
A mask, eh?

25:06.373 --> 25:10.129
Like Zorro, huh?

25:10.278 --> 25:13.110
- When did that happen?
- A few weeks back.

25:16.149 --> 25:18.805
- Put in a report?
- It got away from me.

25:18.953 --> 25:21.707
Mm-hmm.

25:21.855 --> 25:24.512
Andre.

25:24.658 --> 25:28.414
We're going to need you
to come down to the office

25:28.563 --> 25:30.497
and straighten out
a couple of things.

25:32.467 --> 25:34.087
I'm running
a business here.

25:34.235 --> 25:35.827
I ain't going nowhere.

25:41.477 --> 25:44.031
Give me a bottle
of Mylanta.

25:44.178 --> 25:45.770
Please.

25:50.419 --> 25:53.174
His whole story is fucked,
and here's why:

25:53.321 --> 25:55.609
First, it don't
make any sense.

25:55.757 --> 25:57.110
The shooter took
out the woman

25:57.259 --> 25:59.747
and left him breathing
to talk to you.

25:59.895 --> 26:01.182
He should be dead, too.

26:01.330 --> 26:03.729
Second, there's
a drug depot in there.

26:05.869 --> 26:06.755
Ah!

26:06.902 --> 26:09.055
The glass,
reinforced steel,

26:09.204 --> 26:11.693
camera, low inventory.

26:11.839 --> 26:14.462
And, third,
he's shining us on

26:14.610 --> 26:18.866
about that
big-ass.50-cal hole

26:19.014 --> 26:20.001
because I know
who put it there,

26:20.149 --> 26:21.469
and he knows
who put it there.

26:21.616 --> 26:22.971
And if he were to say,

26:23.118 --> 26:26.307
"Oh, that?
That's Omar's previous.

26:26.455 --> 26:28.342
Ripping off
a re-up in here--"

26:28.491 --> 26:30.979
which is what happened--
he be fucked.

26:31.127 --> 26:32.214
So what?

26:32.362 --> 26:34.683
A guy comes in
the first time

26:34.831 --> 26:37.653
with a.50 caliber because
he knows the glass is thick,

26:37.800 --> 26:40.396
then comes back
the next week with a nine?

26:42.239 --> 26:46.061
The job isn't about picking
the stories we like best.

26:46.209 --> 26:50.364
Motherfucker. Now you're going to
lecture me about what the job is.

26:50.513 --> 26:53.778
- My apologies.
- Okay. Let's go downtown.

27:03.761 --> 27:05.114
It's a new law, yo--

27:05.263 --> 27:06.916
three pills,
that's felony weight.

27:07.064 --> 27:09.118
And you're on
a pre-indicted corner?

27:09.265 --> 27:11.920
- What?
- You better show some stash.

27:12.068 --> 27:13.555
Oh, it's off
the chart now.

27:13.704 --> 27:16.092
Those DC boys down there,
too, right.

27:16.240 --> 27:18.795
They love fresh Baltimore ass.

27:18.942 --> 27:20.595
- Mm-mmm.
- I ain't know no stash.

27:20.743 --> 27:23.566
They say
it's better than pussy.

27:23.714 --> 27:26.169
- Those my pills.
- Yeah.

27:26.317 --> 27:29.604
Have you ever heard
of federal guidelines?

27:29.752 --> 27:31.575
Pre-indicted corners,
homeboy.

27:31.723 --> 27:34.714
That's three years mandatory.
Unless you mitigate.

27:36.894 --> 27:39.349
- Mit-a-what?
- The stash, front boy.

27:39.496 --> 27:43.286
I don't know no stash.
Those my pills, man.

27:43.435 --> 27:45.254
I'm high
right now, look.

27:45.402 --> 27:47.690
Yeah.

27:47.838 --> 27:49.926
They gonna love him
up in there. Come on.

27:50.075 --> 27:51.427
- I saw him first.
- Yeah?

27:51.576 --> 27:53.763
- Bitch is mine.
- Those are my pills, I swear.

27:53.911 --> 27:55.139
That's two.

27:56.314 --> 27:58.544
Get the fuck in the car.

27:59.651 --> 28:01.105
Damn, fractions?

28:01.253 --> 28:02.405
He's doing fractions.

28:02.554 --> 28:03.707
Shit, you want to know
what we talked about

28:03.855 --> 28:05.176
in my new class today?

28:05.323 --> 28:06.711
- What?
- Slinging.

28:06.858 --> 28:08.145
Yo, I'm not playing.

28:08.294 --> 28:09.581
We talked about business,

28:09.727 --> 28:11.348
about putting shit
on the damn street.

28:11.496 --> 28:12.382
Nigga, please.

28:12.530 --> 28:14.119
It was like
we schooling them.

28:14.267 --> 28:16.154
Yo, my new class
is the shit.

28:16.301 --> 28:18.522
Yo, you going
by the gym today?

28:18.670 --> 28:20.524
No, man.
I gotta go vial up

28:20.672 --> 28:23.061
what's left on this package
so I can re-up.

28:23.209 --> 28:24.094
All right.

28:24.242 --> 28:25.729
- All right, man.
- Peace, man.

28:25.878 --> 28:27.243
That shit is
easy though, right?

28:37.924 --> 28:40.713
I got to leave soon,
Duquan.

28:40.860 --> 28:42.447
Okay.

28:42.596 --> 28:43.681
What level are you on?

28:43.830 --> 28:44.983
12.

28:45.131 --> 28:47.785
Ah, I never
made it past 10.

28:47.935 --> 28:49.731
Want to see me
get to 40?

28:52.138 --> 28:54.825
That's cheating.

28:54.974 --> 28:56.635
Want me
to show you how?

29:02.482 --> 29:04.336
Baltimore City
Police Department.

29:04.483 --> 29:07.606
Yes, ma'am,
this is Sydney Handjerker

29:07.754 --> 29:10.976
with Handjerker,
Cohen & Bromburg.

29:11.124 --> 29:14.080
I'm trying to locate
a Sergeant Thomas Hauk

29:14.227 --> 29:16.182
in regards to a client
I am representing.

29:16.331 --> 29:17.525
Hold, please.

29:18.966 --> 29:21.020
Mayor's office,
Lieutenant Hoskins.

29:21.168 --> 29:23.657
Yes, hello.
This is Ervin Pepper

29:23.804 --> 29:25.925
of Pepper, Pepper
& Bayleaf.

29:26.074 --> 29:30.094
I'm calling in regards to a Sergeant
Thomas Hauk in regards to a--

29:30.243 --> 29:33.304
He's no longer on this detail.
Hold on for a minute.

29:36.484 --> 29:38.838
Major Crimes.
May I help you?

29:38.987 --> 29:43.109
This is Dr. Jay calling with
test results for Thomas Hauk.

29:43.256 --> 29:44.377
He's on the street.

29:44.524 --> 29:46.245
You want to leave
a message?

29:46.393 --> 29:48.328
Hello?

29:55.769 --> 29:57.057
Let's do it.

29:57.206 --> 29:59.626
You've just got to
walk up on him, all right?

29:59.774 --> 30:01.328
Snap one.

30:01.476 --> 30:03.696
We've gotta make sure
he's from New York first, right?

30:03.845 --> 30:04.898
Gotta ask.

30:05.045 --> 30:07.034
Ask what?
"You from New York?"

30:07.181 --> 30:08.902
No, ask a Baltimore question,

30:09.050 --> 30:10.703
something a New York
nigger won't know.

30:10.852 --> 30:13.206
- What's a Baltimore question, yo?
- I don't know,

30:13.354 --> 30:15.476
Iike, maybe something
about club music.

30:15.624 --> 30:18.178
They don't know nothing
about that shit up in New York.

30:18.326 --> 30:19.947
Huh?

30:20.094 --> 30:23.417
Ask him, like,
who Young Leek be.

30:23.565 --> 30:26.854
( quotes lyrics )

30:27.002 --> 30:28.723
Or K-Swift.

30:28.870 --> 30:33.461
Man, I know nothing about
that 92Q shit, man.

30:33.609 --> 30:35.129
Man, who gives
a fuck, yo?

30:35.276 --> 30:37.797
You don't know
Marc Clarke?

30:37.945 --> 30:40.502
"The Big Phat
Morning Show"?

30:40.649 --> 30:42.535
You ain't right, girl.

30:42.684 --> 30:45.239
The average Baltimore nigga is gonna
know all that shit, all right?

30:45.388 --> 30:47.508
They don't listen
to that shit up in New York.

30:47.656 --> 30:49.277
They listen to some bullshit
up in New York.

30:49.425 --> 30:51.012
- Go ahead.
- All right, whatever.

30:51.161 --> 30:53.114
Hey, got a bet
going on, man.

30:53.263 --> 30:55.116
- What's up?
- Who's your favorite one

30:55.265 --> 30:56.919
on "The Big Phat
Morning Show," yo?

30:57.068 --> 30:58.987
What, are you a New York, girl?
Sonjay.

30:59.135 --> 31:01.456
- Who? Who?
- Kill that show any day.

31:01.604 --> 31:03.725
Snoop! Snoop, yo!
Snoop, yo! Yo!

31:03.872 --> 31:06.739
Chill! Sonjay be
on the show too.

31:14.284 --> 31:17.311
So maybe I ask the questions
from now on, all right?

31:19.556 --> 31:22.244
And then they basically entrap
some poor bastard on a bet,

31:22.392 --> 31:23.546
haul in
$20 worth of drugs.

31:23.694 --> 31:25.380
Now they've got to
process him, feed him,

31:25.528 --> 31:26.515
property voucher his bike.

31:26.663 --> 31:27.883
Next thing,
they're working on

31:28.031 --> 31:30.252
some 14-year-old smoke hound
like he's Bin Laden.

31:30.400 --> 31:32.656
The big haul there is
three vials of cocaine.

31:32.802 --> 31:35.158
I mean,
are you with this?

31:35.305 --> 31:37.193
I've been fighting
this bullshit for years.

31:37.340 --> 31:38.926
The only way to go
is high-end enforcement.

31:39.075 --> 31:41.431
You pick the targets
that'll make a dent out there,

31:41.579 --> 31:42.998
reduce the violence.

31:43.147 --> 31:44.634
So what's the problem?

31:44.782 --> 31:46.435
Problem is
I do what I'm told.

31:46.584 --> 31:48.142
Meaning?

31:49.687 --> 31:53.209
Mr. Mayor, I'm no more
a racist than you are.

31:53.357 --> 31:55.410
The thing about
affirmative action--

31:55.558 --> 31:57.714
I'm just talking policy here,
no offense intended--

31:57.863 --> 32:00.583
- None taken.
- --it's a numbers game.

32:00.732 --> 32:03.653
And numbers games
breed more numbers games.

32:03.800 --> 32:05.622
You need a 20% hike
in the hiring of black officers

32:05.770 --> 32:07.590
to keep up with
the city demographic.

32:07.739 --> 32:09.893
But that's also got to be reflected
straight up the chain,

32:10.040 --> 32:13.629
which means fast-tracking
some people past where their--

32:13.778 --> 32:15.499
how do I say this--

32:15.646 --> 32:18.002
there are experienced warrants.

32:18.150 --> 32:20.604
And he who owes his good fortune
to the numbers,

32:20.751 --> 32:21.638
abides in them.

32:21.786 --> 32:25.042
Gotta show arrests
are up 15, 20%.

32:25.190 --> 32:27.211
We'll worry about
the quality later.

32:27.359 --> 32:29.946
So what you saw out there,
it's a con game,

32:30.095 --> 32:31.348
a Band-Aid on cancers.

32:31.496 --> 32:34.917
So no, I'm not with this,
but I do follow orders.

32:35.066 --> 32:39.223
However, if those
orders were to change,

32:39.370 --> 32:42.705
or if I had the opportunity
to change them myself...

32:56.923 --> 32:58.276
Oh no, you not!

32:58.424 --> 33:00.044
What's this shit
doing in my house?

33:00.192 --> 33:01.278
I stretching bottles, Ma.

33:01.426 --> 33:02.480
You ever see your daddy

33:02.627 --> 33:04.349
bring his work home
with him like that?

33:04.496 --> 33:07.085
That's what you got
a lieutenant for.

33:07.233 --> 33:09.654
Police come through this door
instead of your mother,

33:09.802 --> 33:11.890
they will have
this whole damn house.

33:12.037 --> 33:14.393
This has all got to be packed up
and elsewhere right now.

33:14.541 --> 33:16.428
All right, be cool.

33:16.576 --> 33:18.669
Wait till Bey
hears about this.

33:24.885 --> 33:27.640
Did you hear that naked-ass appeal
to racial solidarity?

33:27.787 --> 33:30.175
I'd like to kick his
pale entitled ass.

33:30.323 --> 33:31.944
Were you listening?

33:32.093 --> 33:34.513
He's no more
a racist than I am.

33:34.660 --> 33:36.788
Might have to
kick your ass, too.

33:39.833 --> 33:42.788
What have you heard
about this fellow Daniels?

33:42.936 --> 33:44.256
Major in the Western.

33:44.404 --> 33:46.091
Yeah, he's there,

33:46.240 --> 33:48.059
but not much politically.

33:48.209 --> 33:50.939
I don't think he's got
any suction with anybody.

33:58.285 --> 34:00.048
Where's the Rice-A-Roni?

34:01.154 --> 34:02.741
Ma, where's the Rice-A-Roni?

34:02.890 --> 34:04.277
There was this
boy on the stoop

34:04.423 --> 34:06.446
that looked like
he was starving.

34:06.593 --> 34:07.681
So you cooked it
for him?

34:07.828 --> 34:10.382
Naw, I just gave it
to him.

34:10.531 --> 34:12.485
You just gave it
to him.

34:12.632 --> 34:15.228
Boy ate a raw box
of Rice-A-Roni?

34:20.208 --> 34:22.496
How much did you sell
the groceries for?

34:22.643 --> 34:24.202
Don't look at me
like that.

34:25.813 --> 34:27.337
I gotta go out.

34:39.025 --> 34:42.049
- $10?
- You have your Rice-A-Roni profits.

34:42.196 --> 34:45.186
Michael, come on!

34:45.333 --> 34:48.121
Boy, I ain't gonna let
you hold the DSS card

34:48.271 --> 34:50.324
if you ain't gonna
do right by me.

34:50.472 --> 34:52.837
You're gonna let me
hold that card.

34:54.676 --> 34:56.474
You're a hard child.

35:07.089 --> 35:10.183
Next time, don't go selling
the food out of our mouths!

35:15.198 --> 35:16.717
Yeah, like y'all say--

35:16.865 --> 35:18.152
don't lie, don't bunk,

35:18.301 --> 35:20.788
don't cheat, don't steal,
or whatever.

35:20.936 --> 35:22.390
But what about y'all, huh?

35:22.538 --> 35:24.392
What, the government?

35:24.541 --> 35:26.260
What it-- Enron? Ha!

35:26.409 --> 35:28.229
Steroids, yeah.

35:28.377 --> 35:29.264
Liquor business?

35:29.412 --> 35:31.434
Booze is the real killer
out there.

35:31.581 --> 35:33.515
And cigarettes--
oh, shit.

35:35.585 --> 35:37.172
Hey, you got
some smokes in there?

35:37.319 --> 35:39.116
I'm trying to quit.

35:41.258 --> 35:43.112
And drugs paid
your salary, right?

35:43.258 --> 35:44.980
No, not exactly,
but I get your point.

35:45.128 --> 35:46.814
We do the same thing
as y'all,

35:46.962 --> 35:50.452
except when we do it, it's like,
"Oh my God, these kids is animals."

35:50.601 --> 35:52.754
Like it's the end of
the world coming.

35:52.903 --> 35:55.791
Man, that's bullshit,
all right?

35:55.939 --> 35:59.895
'Cause it's like-- what is it--
hypocrite-- hypocritical.

36:00.043 --> 36:01.464
I mean, yeah,
we got our thing,

36:01.611 --> 36:02.831
but this is just part
of the big thing.

36:02.979 --> 36:04.200
Exactly.

36:04.347 --> 36:06.403
But this corner-boy
thing, right?

36:06.550 --> 36:08.837
All y'all did all this
talking up in here.

36:08.986 --> 36:10.339
You think
you could sit down

36:10.488 --> 36:11.740
and write down
the laws to your thing?

36:11.888 --> 36:13.409
Hell yeah.
I'll do it right now.

36:13.556 --> 36:14.684
Shit.

36:16.360 --> 36:18.793
No, I'm talking about--
can y'all do it together?

36:23.101 --> 36:25.089
I give the test
on fractions,

36:25.235 --> 36:27.123
half the kids
have breakdowns.

36:27.271 --> 36:30.426
I still have a lot of kids who can
barely handle whole numbers.

36:30.573 --> 36:31.929
Well, if it's any comfort,

36:32.076 --> 36:35.732
I have outside
of my advanced class

36:35.880 --> 36:38.868
maybe half a dozen
reading at grade level.

36:39.016 --> 36:41.071
Try having them on
the periodic table of elements.

36:41.219 --> 36:42.872
The thing is,
it's your curriculum,

36:43.021 --> 36:44.308
and you have to
stick to it.

36:44.455 --> 36:46.442
- I can't. It's absurd.
- You have to.

36:46.590 --> 36:48.646
That test in April is
the difference between

36:48.794 --> 36:51.015
the state taking over
the school or not.

36:51.163 --> 36:52.651
Maybe the state should.

36:52.798 --> 36:56.185
Look, you teach math,
you teach the test.

36:56.333 --> 36:57.655
North Avenue
is all about

36:57.804 --> 37:00.625
the leave-no-child-behind stuff
getting spoon-fed.

37:00.771 --> 37:03.127
And what do they learn?

37:03.275 --> 37:04.762
Find some middle ground.

37:04.910 --> 37:07.831
Every day try to do
a little for the statewide,

37:07.979 --> 37:10.567
and keep a unit problem on
the blackboard for Donnelly.

37:10.715 --> 37:12.036
You know,
if she comes to visit,

37:12.184 --> 37:13.437
she thinks
you're on point.

37:13.585 --> 37:15.173
The rest of the time,

37:15.320 --> 37:17.508
do what you feel like
you need to do.

37:17.656 --> 37:18.976
But be careful.

37:19.125 --> 37:21.545
You're are still on the far side
of your evaluation.

37:21.694 --> 37:24.115
The first year
isn't about the kids,

37:24.264 --> 37:26.356
it's about you surviving.

37:30.203 --> 37:32.171
Whoo-hoo!

37:39.078 --> 37:39.999
Get up!

37:40.146 --> 37:41.032
Get up!

37:41.181 --> 37:42.546
Hands on your head.

37:45.751 --> 37:47.638
- I was eating that.
- Fuck you.

37:47.787 --> 37:50.508
- That's my lunch.
- Fuck you.

37:50.657 --> 37:53.454
Find a wall,
motherfuckers. Man.

37:55.628 --> 37:56.782
Get your feet up.

37:56.931 --> 37:58.584
- This is harassment.
- What did I say to you?

37:58.732 --> 38:02.588
"Fuck you."
That's what you said to me.

38:02.736 --> 38:04.290
There's nothing here,
man.

38:04.437 --> 38:06.859
Oops. My bad.

38:07.007 --> 38:08.562
You want to play
games with me?

38:08.709 --> 38:10.830
I'm going to be in your people's shit
like this every day

38:10.978 --> 38:12.431
until my camera
comes home.

38:12.579 --> 38:15.735
You hear me?
Every day.

38:15.884 --> 38:18.750
You and yours.
Let's go.

38:20.120 --> 38:22.340
Ah, that felt good!

38:22.490 --> 38:25.050
The old Western DEU
rides again.

38:28.096 --> 38:30.015
Yes?

38:30.163 --> 38:33.186
Anyone from the ClD
reports at the front desk.

38:33.334 --> 38:36.423
Any ClD reports
to the front desk.

38:36.570 --> 38:38.924
Respectfully, sir,
I would feel better if you cleared this

38:39.072 --> 38:40.597
through the chain of command.

38:44.012 --> 38:45.240
Yes, sir.

38:47.848 --> 38:49.282
I'll think about that.

38:54.488 --> 38:56.788
- Problem with the bosses?
- One in particular.

38:58.427 --> 39:00.895
- That was our mayor-to-be.
- Carcetti?

39:02.163 --> 39:04.351
Seriously?

39:04.499 --> 39:06.521
He wants to meet.

39:06.669 --> 39:09.056
You and him? Alone?

39:09.203 --> 39:11.591
He wants to talk about
the police department--

39:11.739 --> 39:13.660
what works,
what doesn't.

39:13.809 --> 39:16.263
You have
the mayor's ear now.

39:16.412 --> 39:17.999
Look at you.

39:18.146 --> 39:19.467
Here's the thing:
What do I say?

39:19.614 --> 39:21.002
What do you mean
what do you say?

39:21.149 --> 39:22.938
How honest should I be?

39:23.085 --> 39:25.239
I mean, it's one thing
for me to talk technical shit

39:25.386 --> 39:26.742
or enforcement strategies,

39:26.888 --> 39:29.110
but the shit
that actually goes on?

39:29.257 --> 39:31.245
I start talking about that,
I don't know if I can stop.

39:31.393 --> 39:33.514
Cedric, this is
your chance.

39:33.663 --> 39:36.284
This is a career.

39:36.432 --> 39:38.318
What if I take my shots
at Burrell and Rawls

39:38.467 --> 39:40.956
and he decides not
to clean house? What then?

39:41.103 --> 39:43.357
The new mayor
calls you up,

39:43.505 --> 39:45.159
asks you for
your take on things,

39:45.307 --> 39:46.929
and you don't want to be,
what, a politic?

39:47.075 --> 39:50.299
Carcetti-- ugh.
I don't even know the man.

39:50.447 --> 39:52.034
If he is calling you,

39:52.182 --> 39:55.514
it's because guys like
Burrell and Rawls are on the ropes.

39:57.253 --> 39:59.875
- Maybe.
- I know there is a risk,

40:00.023 --> 40:04.858
but maybe I'd fire away...

40:07.130 --> 40:09.064
both barrels.

40:12.535 --> 40:15.698
I'll wait out here, man.
Up top.

40:20.276 --> 40:21.897
I'll wait, I'll wait.

40:22.044 --> 40:23.833
You got that grub,
you got that pot?

40:23.980 --> 40:25.141
Aw, wait.

40:26.851 --> 40:28.438
( quotes lyrics )
Yo.

40:28.585 --> 40:30.139
Who made that track?

40:30.285 --> 40:31.774
Yo, who you talking to,
dawg?

40:31.922 --> 40:34.544
I'm asking
who Young Leek be.

40:34.691 --> 40:36.045
You mean
2 Phat's cousin?

40:36.192 --> 40:37.212
- Who?
- No.

40:37.361 --> 40:38.648
Nigga, then how the fuck
should I know?!

40:38.795 --> 40:40.216
Yo, who the fuck
is you talking--

40:40.364 --> 40:43.253
- Aw, shit.
- Not bad.

40:43.401 --> 40:44.663
Fuck that nigga.

40:50.642 --> 40:53.063
What up, B?

40:53.210 --> 40:55.542
- Where Ma at?
- Upstairs.

40:59.317 --> 41:02.480
Michael, my daddy
came home.

41:03.854 --> 41:05.141
Daddy came home?

41:05.289 --> 41:08.952
- Look who home!
- Michael.

41:18.603 --> 41:20.627
Damn, you grew.

41:34.420 --> 41:36.751
And a pack of Kools
for Macia.

41:38.923 --> 41:40.744
Still tricking
for that clown?

41:40.893 --> 41:44.249
You know, I don't understand
why people talk trash about him.

41:44.396 --> 41:45.283
All I know
is he loves me.

41:45.430 --> 41:46.985
Well, when you
get tired of him

41:47.132 --> 41:48.653
going upside
your head and all,

41:48.801 --> 41:50.956
you'll really know
who loves you.

41:51.104 --> 41:52.093
Whatever.

41:54.573 --> 41:55.734
Whoa.

42:02.014 --> 42:03.480
Motherfucker, what?

42:11.524 --> 42:13.778
He had 12 years.

42:13.926 --> 42:16.581
Parole.

42:16.729 --> 42:17.983
It was only
a drug charge.

42:18.131 --> 42:20.151
You swore he wasn't
coming back.

42:20.300 --> 42:22.722
This is a good thing,
Michael.

42:22.870 --> 42:25.157
It's going to be
back the way it was.

42:25.305 --> 42:27.159
The way it was?

42:27.307 --> 42:29.103
We a family again.

42:32.213 --> 42:34.113
You lied to me.

42:37.951 --> 42:39.679
People change, Michael.

42:42.689 --> 42:45.878
He said you can give him back
the independence card too.

42:46.025 --> 42:48.256
He gonna take care
of all that for us.

42:58.373 --> 43:00.493
Thanks for coming up
from Washington.

43:00.642 --> 43:02.561
The party is happy
for the opportunity.

43:02.709 --> 43:04.965
You've got some heat
behind you at this point.

43:05.112 --> 43:07.234
- But down to business.
- The way we see it,

43:07.382 --> 43:09.903
we've got to cobble together
a citywide turnaround,

43:10.051 --> 43:11.904
call it the "Baltimore Miracle"
or some shit.

43:12.052 --> 43:14.841
Which starts with
a 10% drop in crime.

43:14.989 --> 43:16.842
Since that was
your campaign cry,

43:16.991 --> 43:19.111
- you want the double digits.
- No doubt.

43:19.260 --> 43:21.448
Denny's got to do a bricks-and-mortar
project downtown,

43:21.596 --> 43:22.684
put his name on something.

43:22.832 --> 43:23.950
We're flushed with stadiums,

43:24.098 --> 43:25.453
got hotels out of the ass.

43:25.600 --> 43:27.888
You guys got a good
convention center?

43:28.037 --> 43:30.323
- And a convention center expansion.
- Gotta put something up,

43:30.471 --> 43:32.126
get the sign
on it that says,

43:32.273 --> 43:33.560
"Brought to you
by Tommy Carcetti

43:33.709 --> 43:34.829
and the citizens of Baltimore."

43:34.976 --> 43:37.198
Well, think on it,
but you don't have

43:37.344 --> 43:39.599
- too much time to decide.
- Anything else?

43:39.747 --> 43:41.502
Education always polls good.

43:41.650 --> 43:43.538
Oh no, we've got to
stay away from schools.

43:43.686 --> 43:45.339
Our last
four administrations

43:45.487 --> 43:48.208
Ieft us with an inner-city system
with inner-city problems.

43:48.357 --> 43:50.111
We get involved,
start talking shit,

43:50.259 --> 43:51.979
it becomes our mess.

43:52.126 --> 43:54.594
Gotta respect the depths.

43:55.597 --> 43:57.920
One, you get
the drop in crime;

43:58.067 --> 43:59.587
two, you build
something downtown;

43:59.735 --> 44:01.756
and three, you stay
away from schools;

44:01.903 --> 44:04.092
And, four, you keep
your boyish good looks.

44:04.240 --> 44:07.462
You do all that, you might be running
for governor in 2008,

44:07.610 --> 44:10.732
maybe take back that
statehouse for us, hmm?

44:10.881 --> 44:13.848
- Can you get him a square corner?
- Easy.

44:42.946 --> 44:44.800
You okay?

44:44.948 --> 44:48.036
Yeah.

44:48.184 --> 44:49.973
You sure?

44:50.120 --> 44:52.918
- Is it something at home?
- No.

44:54.457 --> 44:56.946
- Come on.
- I said no.

44:57.095 --> 44:58.924
Okay.

45:00.865 --> 45:04.153
If there's ever anything
you want to talk about...

45:04.301 --> 45:06.188
there's me,
but if you'd rather,

45:06.337 --> 45:08.691
I can write you a pass

45:08.839 --> 45:11.226
to see the social worker.

45:11.375 --> 45:13.399
Just say when.

45:18.748 --> 45:20.979
Michael, do you want
to see the social worker?

45:24.222 --> 45:25.381
No.

45:40.505 --> 45:42.660
I have to say,
I've never seen kids like them

45:42.808 --> 45:44.128
this animated
in a classroom.

45:44.275 --> 45:46.663
Focused-- the corner
culture kids, at least.

45:46.811 --> 45:48.966
The ones with deeper problems,
they opted out of that.

45:49.115 --> 45:50.401
Deeper problems?

45:50.549 --> 45:52.168
We're not just up against
corner logic in there.

45:52.317 --> 45:54.438
I am seeing oppositional
defiant disorders,

45:54.586 --> 45:56.874
clinical depression,
post traumatic stress,

45:57.022 --> 45:59.778
and with the girl Shaundra,
borderline psychoses maybe.

45:59.925 --> 46:01.212
With those
type of problems,

46:01.361 --> 46:03.914
we are gonna have to have
a social worker here full-time.

46:04.062 --> 46:06.317
But the corner kids, yeah,
they really came alive.

46:06.466 --> 46:07.785
Yeah, when they talk
about what they know,

46:07.933 --> 46:09.820
they talk from here,
and they stay on point.

46:09.969 --> 46:11.823
Shit, they have been even
taking turns in there.

46:11.970 --> 46:13.157
Question is:
Can we get them

46:13.306 --> 46:15.492
in that kind of mindset
on stuff they don't know?

46:15.641 --> 46:17.261
Can we have them learn
on faith alone?

46:17.410 --> 46:21.174
In all honesty,
this is uncharted territory.

46:23.583 --> 46:26.203
Where do you go
from here?

46:26.352 --> 46:27.839
How about we just
let this ride,

46:27.987 --> 46:29.613
see where it takes us?

46:30.856 --> 46:32.411
All right, see,
here's the thing:

46:32.558 --> 46:34.480
Once you got it,
it's all you.

46:34.627 --> 46:36.748
Anything happen,
I'm gonna have to fuck you up.

46:36.896 --> 46:38.183
Yeah, but that's nothing.

46:38.331 --> 46:40.353
'Cause the guy trusting me
on this-- Marlo--

46:40.501 --> 46:42.922
he'll kill you
and your whole family.

46:43.070 --> 46:44.656
So don't go
shaking the bottles

46:44.805 --> 46:46.692
'cause Marlo weighs
that shit every time.

46:46.839 --> 46:48.861
- I ain't shaking shit.
- See that you don't,

46:49.009 --> 46:50.942
'cause if you do fuck with it,
I'm gonna know.

47:05.627 --> 47:07.321
All right, that's good.

47:20.374 --> 47:22.061
All right, it's good.

47:22.209 --> 47:24.031
All right, see,
you're under 13 and shit.

47:24.179 --> 47:27.034
So you're safe from everybody
but me and Marlo.

47:27.181 --> 47:29.168
- So I'm a lieutenant now?
- Yeah.

47:29.317 --> 47:30.569
You're my lieutenant.

47:30.717 --> 47:32.839
And all I get is
an extra $10?

47:32.987 --> 47:35.455
Yeah, you do this good,
and we'll talk.

47:41.462 --> 47:42.450
See this guy here?

47:42.597 --> 47:44.651
That's the grand jury
prosecutor.

47:44.799 --> 47:46.787
Now, you lie to us,
it's just good clean fun.

47:46.935 --> 47:50.724
But you tell tales to that
three-piece motherfucker, ooh, shit!

47:50.872 --> 47:52.393
I ain't telling lies.

47:52.540 --> 47:55.430
Hey, Gary, let me ask you this
hypothetically:

47:55.576 --> 47:58.433
How much time does a witness
get for lying to your grand jury?

47:58.581 --> 48:00.535
Are you kidding?
As much as I can get him.

48:00.682 --> 48:02.502
- What's the max?
- 10 years.

48:02.651 --> 48:05.272
Oh, you've got people
going away for 10 years?

48:05.420 --> 48:07.307
Oh, hell yeah,
all the time.

48:07.456 --> 48:08.809
10 years!

48:08.958 --> 48:10.310
I thought he was going to say,
like, two or three.

48:10.458 --> 48:12.546
Hey, look, that motherfucker
went upside my head.

48:12.695 --> 48:13.747
I couldn't even
see straight.

48:13.895 --> 48:15.283
Which motherfucker
are we talking about?

48:15.431 --> 48:17.852
Then they got me
on that medication.

48:18.000 --> 48:19.519
It made me groggy as shit.

48:19.668 --> 48:22.556
Then this man starts
working at me--

48:22.704 --> 48:24.926
- Fuck I did!
- I mean, shit!

48:25.074 --> 48:29.130
I'm still groggy now.
I mean, I got to--

48:29.278 --> 48:31.611
is there a washroom around?

48:38.786 --> 48:42.815
- Lying motherfucker.
- For real.

48:50.000 --> 48:51.660
Pull over, asshole.

48:53.302 --> 48:54.327
Shit.

49:01.878 --> 49:03.344
Step out of the car,
please.

49:05.215 --> 49:06.502
Step out of the car.

49:06.650 --> 49:08.277
Put your hands
on the car.

49:10.854 --> 49:12.441
Got anything on you?

49:12.590 --> 49:15.059
Have a seat on the curb.
Have a seat.

49:16.593 --> 49:18.528
Cross your feet.
Put your hands on your head.

49:28.538 --> 49:30.192
What the fuck
is this powder?

49:30.340 --> 49:32.366
Lime from my mama's garden.

49:40.151 --> 49:41.971
What are you building,
a clubhouse?

49:42.119 --> 49:43.840
Oh, that shoot nails.
Be cool.

49:43.987 --> 49:45.421
Oh, I know what it does.

49:51.296 --> 49:53.354
I want my fucking camera.

50:00.072 --> 50:02.892
I heard what you said
at Comstat the other day.

50:03.040 --> 50:05.728
I also hear you're a commander
who knows police work.

50:05.877 --> 50:07.598
That's what people
are saying.

50:07.746 --> 50:11.135
So, yesterday I did
a ride-along in Eastern,

50:11.282 --> 50:14.538
watched street pops,
undercover rips.

50:14.686 --> 50:18.241
- So what am I thinking?
- My guess:

50:18.390 --> 50:21.145
You witnessed a waste
of time, money, energy,

50:21.293 --> 50:23.013
and, in few cases, talent.

50:23.162 --> 50:25.182
Rawls says it's Burrell
and his numbers game.

50:25.331 --> 50:27.251
He says if I unleash him,
put him in the driver's seat,

50:27.399 --> 50:28.553
then all that
bullshit goes south.

50:28.699 --> 50:30.521
See a return
of high-end police work,

50:30.670 --> 50:33.358
says it'll be the dawning
of a new day.

50:33.506 --> 50:36.128
- Rawls said that?
- Yeah.

50:36.275 --> 50:38.496
Says he's just
following orders,

50:38.645 --> 50:40.432
being a good soldier.

50:40.580 --> 50:43.602
What do you say?

50:43.750 --> 50:45.102
Mr. Mayor, if you
want to talk to me

50:45.251 --> 50:46.871
about what happens
in the street

50:47.020 --> 50:48.773
or what goes on under me
in the Western,

50:48.922 --> 50:51.009
I'll talk your ear off.

50:51.158 --> 50:52.844
But I'm a soldier too.

50:52.991 --> 50:55.112
I don't go up the chain
with my opinions.

50:55.261 --> 50:56.947
I can respect that.

50:57.097 --> 50:58.751
I will say this though:

50:58.898 --> 51:01.386
We did have one unit
doing high-end stuff--

51:01.534 --> 51:03.422
Major Crimes working out
of an offsite

51:03.569 --> 51:04.856
down on Clinton Street.

51:05.004 --> 51:08.337
"Did" is past tense.
What wrecked it?

51:10.510 --> 51:12.130
Good question,
Mr. Mayor.

51:12.279 --> 51:15.000
With Ray Foersters'
passing,

51:15.149 --> 51:17.637
I'm going to need
a new ClD commander right away.

51:17.785 --> 51:20.618
Would you object to being
made colonel working under Rawls?

51:24.991 --> 51:25.978
Under Rawls?

51:26.127 --> 51:28.647
He is deputy ops,
is he not?

51:28.795 --> 51:31.818
Is the mayor going to
make the changes

51:31.965 --> 51:33.865
or just leave it
to the good soldier?

51:35.536 --> 51:39.291
What I'm really asking is:
How for real are you?

51:39.440 --> 51:42.695
Well, I guess we're going to
find that out together, aren't we...

51:42.844 --> 51:46.540
Colonel Daniels?

51:51.920 --> 51:53.750
What the fuck do we do?

51:55.255 --> 51:58.748
I don't know.
These guys don't scare.

52:00.661 --> 52:03.849
If we all kick in--
you, me, Sydnor--

52:03.998 --> 52:06.053
maybe we could afford
a used camera.

52:06.202 --> 52:07.655
I thought of that.

52:07.802 --> 52:09.756
It ain't gonna match
the serial numbers

52:09.905 --> 52:11.929
from the one
for my lSD.

52:15.277 --> 52:17.030
We've gotta get wood
on Marlo.

52:17.179 --> 52:19.146
It's the only way.

52:20.682 --> 52:23.471
This Randy kid,
he can't give us a murder, right?

52:23.619 --> 52:26.608
Shit, he can't even
give us a body.

52:26.756 --> 52:28.175
But he says some
Little Kevin kid

52:28.323 --> 52:32.313
was the one supposed
to tell Lex to go up in that alley.

52:32.460 --> 52:34.952
Plus, what did fuck-nut
say Little Kev said?

52:36.564 --> 52:38.018
"Lex went up the alley,

52:38.166 --> 52:40.155
but he ain't coming back."

52:40.302 --> 52:42.156
Maybe he saw
the whole thing.

52:42.305 --> 52:44.926
Maybe he's
our eyeball witness.

52:45.073 --> 52:46.803
- Little Kevin?
- Little Kevin.

52:56.651 --> 52:58.239
Carry the four.

52:58.388 --> 53:00.508
80, 100, 10, 20.

53:00.657 --> 53:02.343
420.

53:02.492 --> 53:03.923
Where's the rest?

53:05.528 --> 53:07.449
Um... I'm on a hard strip.

53:07.597 --> 53:08.817
It's tricky on Lafayette.

53:08.964 --> 53:10.852
What the fuck are
you doing there?

53:11.001 --> 53:12.220
I've got to build it up.

53:12.368 --> 53:14.957
Nah nah, you ain't got
to build up shit.

53:15.105 --> 53:17.926
Your father built them corners,
and they owe you

53:18.074 --> 53:19.862
'cause they owe him.

53:20.010 --> 53:21.562
Bodie's got
a real short memory

53:21.711 --> 53:23.232
when it comes
to giving props.

53:23.380 --> 53:24.711
Ma.

53:29.219 --> 53:31.340
I going to straighten
this shit out right now.

53:31.489 --> 53:33.575
Ma, let me build.

53:33.724 --> 53:35.418
Ma!

53:38.929 --> 53:40.617
Sir.

53:40.765 --> 53:42.562
Bill...

53:45.435 --> 53:47.557
we need to regroup.

53:47.703 --> 53:50.427
I've come up
with something fresh

53:50.574 --> 53:52.065
for the new administration.

53:54.244 --> 53:58.168
Hmm? I don't mind
telling you,

53:58.316 --> 54:02.072
I'm uncomfortable with the way Carcetti
is running around in our shop.

54:02.219 --> 54:05.655
He's talked to me
several times.

54:11.896 --> 54:13.830
You're making
your move, huh?

54:23.008 --> 54:26.364
We were a good team,
you and me.

54:26.511 --> 54:28.741
We were.

54:57.243 --> 55:00.231
- Miss Ella, where Bug at?
- He went home, Michael.

55:00.380 --> 55:02.133
Nah, he waits for me.

55:02.281 --> 55:05.102
The man who came and picked him up
said he was his father.

55:05.250 --> 55:07.471
And Bug said so, too.

55:07.620 --> 55:09.144
Fuck!

55:10.522 --> 55:12.353
Mmm.

55:31.912 --> 55:33.936
What the fuck
did you do?

55:36.015 --> 55:37.502
And why'd you
let him do it?

55:37.650 --> 55:39.005
- Hey, listen to me--
- No.

55:39.152 --> 55:41.373
That's how you got him
with his head up his ass--

55:41.522 --> 55:43.810
unsolving his own
fucking murders.

55:43.958 --> 55:46.893
Your job is to turn red to black,
not the other way.

55:48.127 --> 55:51.291
And you, stand the fuck up
for yourself.

56:00.808 --> 56:02.328
You don't got to
do the whole thing

56:02.476 --> 56:03.830
on your fingers,
little man.

56:03.978 --> 56:05.999
Look, first count--

56:06.147 --> 56:08.168
six and six is...

56:08.316 --> 56:09.303
12.

56:09.450 --> 56:11.971
Put down the two,
you bring over the one.

56:12.119 --> 56:14.172
- Bug.
- Hey, big man.

56:14.321 --> 56:15.542
Get over to me now.

56:15.690 --> 56:17.657
- We were just going to--
- Now.

56:48.490 --> 56:49.752
Yo, hold on.

57:18.688 --> 57:21.748
Yo, you owe me $800 on that,
bitch. You owe!
