WEBVTT

00:25.460 --> 00:27.250
Good morning, Los Angeles.

00:27.250 --> 00:30.170
You're listening to KQRY, AM 530,

00:30.170 --> 00:32.250
your source for news
and traffic on the 1.

00:32.250 --> 00:34.790
In a moment,
we'll hear from Bob on sports

00:34.790 --> 00:37.460
about LA's latest bid for a football team.

00:37.460 --> 00:40.210
But first, we'll turn you
over to Lance Howe in air queue

00:40.210 --> 00:42.670
for a look at the roads.
What's happening out there, Lance?

00:42.670 --> 00:44.210
We've got lots of problems, folks,

00:44.210 --> 00:46.080
so leave plenty of time
for your morning commute.

00:46.080 --> 00:49.080
Bumper-to-bumper traffic already
on the Golden State Freeway,

00:49.080 --> 00:52.250
plus, there's a sig-alert on
the 405 southbound at Crenshaw.

00:52.250 --> 00:55.790
Two left lanes are blocked there,
backing up all the way to the 105.

00:55.790 --> 00:57.710
-We're getting...-

01:00.710 --> 01:01.880
Hello.

01:01.880 --> 01:06.880
Charlie, I have been calling you
for hours.

01:06.880 --> 01:08.330
Are you on the bus?

01:08.330 --> 01:10.580
No. I have
an early meeting, remember?

01:10.580 --> 01:11.710
Where have you been?

01:11.710 --> 01:14.830
-I told you I needed to clear my head.
-

01:14.830 --> 01:16.420
So I went for a drive.

01:16.420 --> 01:18.210
You drove all night?

01:20.040 --> 01:22.000
I got sleepy, so I pulled over.

01:22.000 --> 01:24.960
We have a team meeting in 20 minutes.
Will you be here?

01:24.960 --> 01:26.880
No. I'm going to be late.

01:27.420 --> 01:31.750
Well, I can't show you any favoritism
'cause we're married.

01:31.750 --> 01:34.880
I'm going to have to dock you 10 points
off your quarterly eval.

01:34.880 --> 01:36.460
Do what you have to.

01:36.750 --> 01:39.120
Charlie, what is going on?

01:40.250 --> 01:42.830
Are you jealous
because I got the promotion

01:42.830 --> 01:44.420
and you didn't?

01:44.830 --> 01:46.710
I'm not jealous about your job.

01:48.960 --> 01:52.880
How many times do I have to say
that I'm sorry?

01:53.580 --> 01:54.710
I made a mistake.

01:55.000 --> 01:56.830
It was a one-time thing.

01:57.380 --> 01:59.420
I wish I could believe that.

02:01.290 --> 02:04.380
You were looking for reasons
to stay angry.

02:04.380 --> 02:06.040
I just want
what we used to have...

02:08.170 --> 02:09.670
When Jolene was little

02:11.120 --> 02:13.120
and it was just the three of us...

02:14.830 --> 02:16.540
Happy in our own little bubble.

02:16.960 --> 02:18.120
Before I burst it.

02:18.120 --> 02:20.250
-Is that what you're saying?
-

02:23.040 --> 02:24.790
Look, I have to go.

02:26.040 --> 02:28.750
And you have got to stop punishing me,

02:29.790 --> 02:31.830
or there's no hope for us.

03:05.250 --> 03:06.920
Perfect.

03:06.920 --> 03:09.420
Listen, my bus is here,
so I gotta go. Bye.

03:11.040 --> 03:12.080
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

03:15.000 --> 03:16.580
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

03:16.580 --> 03:17.750
You okay?

03:17.750 --> 03:19.080
We need to get inside,
so if you could open up.

03:19.080 --> 03:20.460
Hey! Call 9-1-1!

03:20.460 --> 03:22.080
Hey, open the door!

03:22.080 --> 03:23.960
Open the door!

03:33.330 --> 03:34.880
Oh, my God.

03:44.620 --> 03:47.540
The weirdest killer I ever worked with
was Archie Sutton,

03:47.540 --> 03:48.750
the Truck Stop Strangler.

03:48.750 --> 03:51.120
Even worse than
the Indonesian female cannibal?

03:51.120 --> 03:52.420
Oddly enough, yes.

03:52.420 --> 03:55.750
Archie had this strange obsession
with talcum powder and butterflies.

03:55.750 --> 03:57.880
So he would sprinkle talcum
on all of his food

03:57.880 --> 04:00.500
and then carry a dead butterfly
in his pocket everywhere he went.

04:00.500 --> 04:02.830
It's amazing you were able to find
something in him you could identify with.

04:02.830 --> 04:05.000
Well, I had to.
I met with him every week for a year.

04:05.000 --> 04:07.210
It was the only way to establish
a therapeutic alliance.

04:07.210 --> 04:08.790
What was it you guys had in common?

04:08.790 --> 04:11.380
We were both obsessed with fossils
when we were kids,

04:11.380 --> 04:14.580
and both of our mothers attended
the same elementary school class.

04:14.580 --> 04:17.500
-A bizarre coincidence, right

04:17.500 --> 04:19.420
Tara's mom went
to the same elementary school

04:19.420 --> 04:20.920
as the Truck Stop Strangler's mom.

04:20.920 --> 04:23.710
-Okay, that's a little creepy somehow.
-Yeah.

04:23.710 --> 04:25.420
Don't get comfortable.
The plane's waiting for us.

04:25.420 --> 04:27.620
Ten minutes ago
there was a poison gas attack

04:27.620 --> 04:29.920
on a City Link commuter bus
in Los Angeles.

04:29.920 --> 04:31.290
Ten confirmed dead so far.

04:31.290 --> 04:33.420
Hazmat just got on the scene.

04:33.420 --> 04:35.670
Chlorine gas was used recently in Syria.
Maybe it's connected.

04:35.670 --> 04:37.750
It also reminds me of the attack
on the Tokyo subway.

04:37.750 --> 04:40.000
Religious cult members carried
plastic bags of sarin

04:40.000 --> 04:41.960
and punctured them with umbrella tips.

04:41.960 --> 04:45.210
That was 1995. It could be
a 20th year anniversary event.

04:45.210 --> 04:46.920
We'll find out.

05:04.750 --> 05:06.290
Charlie, you're okay.

05:06.670 --> 05:08.960
Uh... Yeah. Yeah. Sorry I'm late.

05:09.330 --> 05:10.620
Traffic was horrible.

05:10.620 --> 05:12.420
We were worried.
We know you take the City Link.

05:12.420 --> 05:15.040
I drove today. What's, um...
What's going on?

05:15.670 --> 05:18.460
Didn't you hear? There was
some kind of poison attack on your bus.

05:19.040 --> 05:22.120
Police have still not allowed
any reporters near the scene,

05:22.120 --> 05:24.620
and local residents
have been evacuated.

05:24.620 --> 05:25.960
You okay?

05:25.960 --> 05:27.580
You look awful.

05:28.710 --> 05:29.750
Uh...

05:30.250 --> 05:32.620
Yeah. Yeah. No, I'm... I'm fine. Uh...

05:33.750 --> 05:36.120
This poison attack, it's, uh...
That's horrible.

05:36.120 --> 05:39.290
Yeah, I'll say. You're pretty damn lucky.

05:40.210 --> 05:45.000
The mayor's office and LAPD
have issued a citywide tactical alert,

05:45.000 --> 05:48.790
as we are awaiting a press conference
with the police chief.

05:51.670 --> 05:53.880
...including the driver,
have been found dead

05:53.880 --> 05:55.670
on a City Link commuter bus.

05:55.670 --> 05:58.080
Officials suspect a poison gas attack,

05:58.080 --> 05:59.670
but lab tests are pending.

06:32.500 --> 06:36.000
"It is in your moments of decision
that your destiny is shaped."

06:36.000 --> 06:37.120
Tony Robbins.

06:37.120 --> 06:40.500
Oh, crime-fighters, I just got
confirmation from the LA Field office

06:40.500 --> 06:42.210
that traces of sarin were found.

06:42.210 --> 06:44.670
Sarin is the most volatile
nerve agent there is.

06:44.670 --> 06:46.330
Symptoms are felt within seconds.

06:46.330 --> 06:48.460
Watery eyes, foaming
at the nose and mouth,

06:48.460 --> 06:51.040
and convulsions, paralysis,
and death within minutes.

06:51.040 --> 06:54.380
The last known use of sarin was
two years ago in Syria near Damascus.

06:54.380 --> 06:57.080
We've had recent threats of terrorism
targeting major US cities.

06:57.080 --> 07:00.000
The religious cult responsible
for the Tokyo subway attack

07:00.000 --> 07:02.040
20 years ago is also still active.

07:02.040 --> 07:05.080
Very much so, but they've split
into two branches with different names.

07:05.080 --> 07:08.170
There's over 2,100 members and four
of them are in Southern California.

07:08.170 --> 07:09.290
Where's the leader?

07:09.290 --> 07:10.710
Shoko Asahara is on death row in Japan.

07:10.710 --> 07:13.120
He's incoherent
and confined to a wheelchair.

07:13.120 --> 07:14.830
So he's not calling any shots.

07:14.830 --> 07:17.420
No, but that doesn't rule out
devout followers doing it in his name.

07:17.830 --> 07:19.580
Garcia, what do we know
about the casualties?

07:19.580 --> 07:22.000
Uh, aside from the IDs, not much.

07:22.000 --> 07:25.210
Well, it's six men and four women,
age range 20 to 60.

07:25.210 --> 07:27.210
Victimology seems to be pretty random.

07:27.210 --> 07:29.000
Here's the thing,
Sarin evaporates quickly,

07:29.000 --> 07:30.210
it's hard to control

07:30.210 --> 07:32.380
and would thus be very difficult
to target an individual.

07:32.790 --> 07:35.500
Collateral damage
may mask the real target.

07:35.500 --> 07:37.000
Garcia, look into the victims

07:37.000 --> 07:39.290
and also anyone online
claiming responsibility.

07:39.290 --> 07:40.330
-Aye aye, Captain.-

08:07.290 --> 08:10.000
Hey, Charlie.
A messenger dropped this off for you.

08:10.000 --> 08:11.170
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

08:38.670 --> 08:41.540
F.B.I. Field Office
LOS ANGELES, CA

08:50.120 --> 08:52.960
Aaron Hotchner. It's been a long time.

08:52.960 --> 08:54.670
Natalie, congratulations on the transfer.

08:54.670 --> 08:57.170
Tell me about it.

08:57.170 --> 08:59.580
Agent Colfax,
this is Dr. Tara Lewis.

08:59.580 --> 09:01.080
And SSA Derek Morgan.

09:01.080 --> 09:02.380
Thanks for coming out.

09:02.380 --> 09:06.250
So, based on victim toxicology,
we know that sarin was used.

09:06.250 --> 09:07.790
We still can't find the source.

09:08.120 --> 09:09.540
Here's what we do know.

09:09.540 --> 09:13.210
00 A.M.

09:13.210 --> 09:16.710
It made six stops before Logan Park,
which is where the crash occurred.

09:16.710 --> 09:19.540
What about the locals affiliated
with the former religious cult in Japan?

09:19.540 --> 09:21.210
They all claim
they broke ties with their leader

09:21.210 --> 09:23.460
after he was sentenced
and have denounced terrorism.

09:23.460 --> 09:26.210
That's a convenient thing
to say when the FBI's questioning you.

09:26.210 --> 09:27.880
True, but they're also part of a subgroup

09:27.880 --> 09:30.540
that made the same statement publicly
back in 2007.

09:30.540 --> 09:32.290
Plus, all their alibis checked out.

09:32.290 --> 09:34.380
So Briarwood is the stop
before Logan Park?

09:34.380 --> 09:36.250
Yes. We've been focusing on footage there.

09:36.250 --> 09:39.460
So far, all of the victims were alive
on surveillance at Briarwood.

09:39.460 --> 09:41.750
One of them bring the sarin in
and then commit suicide?

09:41.750 --> 09:44.750
I've examined all the bodies and
there's no physical evidence of that.

09:44.750 --> 09:46.750
It's like a parlor room mystery.

09:46.750 --> 09:49.620
Ah. Okay, so we have
some more information on the victims.

09:49.620 --> 09:51.920
Two are students at Allegra College.

09:51.920 --> 09:54.750
One's an accountant,
one works for an insurance company,

09:54.750 --> 09:57.540
three work at the city clerk's office,
one is a teacher,

09:57.540 --> 09:59.330
but this is interesting.

09:59.330 --> 10:01.500
Michael Hoffman
was a freelance journalist

10:01.500 --> 10:03.170
who previously worked in Syria.

10:03.170 --> 10:06.380
Over 100 journalists have been killed
there since the civil war began.

10:06.380 --> 10:08.620
Maybe Hoffman was targeted.
I'll have Garcia look into it.

10:08.620 --> 10:10.420
And in the meantime,
we need to take a closer look

10:10.420 --> 10:13.290
at all the stops before Logan Park,
including the surrounding areas.

10:13.290 --> 10:14.580
Have them pull surveillance footage

10:14.580 --> 10:16.290
from ATMs, security,
and traffic cameras.

10:16.290 --> 10:17.330
Yeah, will do.

10:24.330 --> 10:25.960
I'm Agent Young.

10:25.960 --> 10:28.540
The hazmat teams says they're
almost done with their decontamination.

10:28.540 --> 10:30.580
Well, the good news with sarin,
if there is such a thing,

10:30.580 --> 10:32.460
is that it's a relatively
short-lived threat.

10:32.460 --> 10:34.620
Once it dissipates,
there's very little clean-up to be done.

10:34.620 --> 10:35.750
Excuse me.

10:35.750 --> 10:38.170
If sarin is so fast and deadly,
how can someone release it

10:38.170 --> 10:40.000
without harming themselves
in the process?

10:40.000 --> 10:42.210
Excellent question.
The cult members in Tokyo

10:42.210 --> 10:43.460
wore surgical masks,

10:43.460 --> 10:45.080
and even with them,
some of them were still injured.

10:45.080 --> 10:46.920
-I'm guessing that...
-The techs just found this.

10:46.920 --> 10:48.960
Stuck under a seat in the third row.

10:48.960 --> 10:50.830
It tested positive for sarin residue.

10:50.830 --> 10:53.290
It looks like some kind
of time-release device.

10:53.790 --> 10:54.830
Looks homemade.

10:55.250 --> 10:56.750
It's battery-operated.

10:56.750 --> 10:59.580
You know, it reminds me
of an automatic fish-food feeder.

10:59.580 --> 11:00.710
How would it work?

11:00.710 --> 11:03.210
With a fish-food feeder,
there's a disk inside with multiple slots,

11:03.210 --> 11:05.330
and each slot is filled with fish food.

11:05.330 --> 11:08.500
As the disk rotates, the food is released
at very specific times.

11:08.500 --> 11:12.330
My assumption is, with this device,
only one slot was filled with sarin,

11:12.330 --> 11:15.330
because even in a minuscule amount,
sarin is deadly.

11:15.330 --> 11:18.000
So someone could have planted that
a long time ago.

11:18.000 --> 11:19.120
How long ago?

11:19.120 --> 11:20.500
My fish-food feeder lasts six weeks.

11:20.500 --> 11:22.750
So, theoretically...

11:25.920 --> 11:28.120
The UnSub could have left
all the slots empty

11:28.120 --> 11:29.750
except for the very last one,

11:29.750 --> 11:32.960
and then waited six weeks
for the sarin to be released.

11:33.960 --> 11:36.250
It means we need to look at everyone
that got on and off that bus

11:36.250 --> 11:37.580
for the last month and a half.

11:38.540 --> 11:39.920
Great.

11:40.210 --> 11:41.920
All right, thanks, Reid.

11:42.790 --> 11:45.540
So if the device was homemade,
maybe the sarin was too.

11:45.540 --> 11:48.080
Well, that'd be difficult.
The process is dangerous.

11:48.080 --> 11:51.500
The Aum cult actually built a $30 million
production facility to make their sarin.

11:51.500 --> 11:53.210
All right, so that rules out
the average Joe,

11:53.210 --> 11:54.830
but a trained chemist could still make it.

11:54.830 --> 11:56.670
And nobody's claimed responsibility?

11:56.670 --> 11:58.960
I don't think
this is the act of a large group.

11:58.960 --> 12:01.420
Okay. So we're looking for somebody
with a personal ax to grind

12:01.420 --> 12:03.920
-who also has access to sarin.
-

12:04.170 --> 12:05.920
Hey, what you got, baby girl?

12:05.920 --> 12:08.960
Someone described Michael Hoffman,
the journalist victim,

12:08.960 --> 12:13.000
as cowardly for leaving Syria in 2011,
just when the trouble started.

12:13.000 --> 12:16.460
But one man's cowardice
is another man's wise risk aversion.

12:16.460 --> 12:19.330
Garcia, did he write anything
that could make him a potential target?

12:19.330 --> 12:21.500
Mmm-mmm. Nothing.
Everything's really non-offensive.

12:21.500 --> 12:22.960
And I have delicate sensibilities.

12:22.960 --> 12:24.920
It's part of your charm, mama.-Aw.

12:24.920 --> 12:28.960
Garcia, I need you to look in the LA area
for any chemists with extremist views,

12:28.960 --> 12:31.000
especially any that might
have been under stress.

12:31.000 --> 12:32.420
Marital, financial, et cetera.

12:32.420 --> 12:34.710
-Okay. Chemists under mucho stress.
-

12:34.710 --> 12:36.460
Thanks.

12:56.620 --> 12:58.880
Wrong answer, Charlie.

12:59.580 --> 13:02.120
Do you really think
you can get away with it?

13:07.040 --> 13:09.080
I don't know what you're talking about.
Who is this?

13:09.080 --> 13:12.170
I'm your best friend.
Or your worst enemy.

13:12.170 --> 13:13.670
It's up to you.

13:13.670 --> 13:16.000
It's simple, really.

13:16.000 --> 13:17.670
I'm texting you an address.

13:17.670 --> 13:20.210
I need you to break in and get a laptop.

13:21.040 --> 13:23.080
Wait, wait, wait. "Break in"

13:23.080 --> 13:25.330
Are you really one to judge?

13:27.380 --> 13:30.420
No. You listen to me.

13:30.790 --> 13:34.710
You know that sweet
daughter of yours, Jolene?

13:35.420 --> 13:37.290
You love her, don't you?

13:37.290 --> 13:41.380
You want to see her graduate,
maybe get married someday.

13:41.380 --> 13:44.710
I don't need to. You already did.

13:44.710 --> 13:47.540
What's gonna happen to her
if you go to prison

13:47.540 --> 13:50.500
How often do you think she'll visit Twice?

13:50.500 --> 13:53.920
Maybe you'll never see her again.
Is that what you want?

13:55.330 --> 13:58.380
You should have thought of that
before you committed murder.

13:59.380 --> 14:01.500
You're a real mystery, Charlie.

14:02.120 --> 14:04.120
You've got quite a dark streak.

14:04.420 --> 14:05.830
-Charlie.
-

14:06.920 --> 14:08.120
You could have been killed this morning.

14:08.120 --> 14:09.880
If you got on that City Link...

14:12.380 --> 14:14.330
We're so lucky.

14:20.290 --> 14:23.170
I think I've let this job
get in the way of our relationship.

14:24.170 --> 14:26.170
And I know that it sounds hokey, but...

14:27.000 --> 14:29.580
I feel like the universe
has given us another chance.

14:31.960 --> 14:33.540
I want to go away together.

14:34.960 --> 14:36.540
Can we do that?

14:39.580 --> 14:40.920
Sure.

14:42.330 --> 14:43.500
Good.

14:44.960 --> 14:46.170
Maybe next weekend.

14:48.330 --> 14:49.920
Sarah.

14:52.210 --> 14:54.540
-Have you found my cell phone yet?
-Mmm-mmm.

14:54.540 --> 14:56.960
I swear
it was on my desk yesterday.

14:57.960 --> 14:59.710
Assuming this wasn't
a fresh batch of sarin,

14:59.710 --> 15:01.120
where would you get
this stuff pre-made?

15:01.120 --> 15:02.250
Technically, nowhere.

15:02.250 --> 15:04.290
After the UN banned
the use of chemical weapons,

15:04.290 --> 15:07.120
everyone was supposed to
destroy their stockpiles by 2007.

15:10.000 --> 15:11.170
Go ahead, Garcia.

15:11.170 --> 15:12.880
I come bearing information gifts.

15:12.880 --> 15:14.290
There are many chemists in the LA area,

15:14.290 --> 15:17.080
but one in particular is Johann Geitman.

15:17.080 --> 15:19.750
He was fired two months ago
from Holder Industries

15:19.750 --> 15:21.330
for online gambling at work.

15:21.670 --> 15:23.540
He posted a huge rant on social media

15:23.540 --> 15:26.210
saying that they would
come to regret what they did.

15:26.210 --> 15:28.000
-Could be retaliation.
-We should talk to him.

15:28.000 --> 15:29.290
Yeah, here's the thing.

15:29.290 --> 15:31.080
I have a PO box where he gets his mail,

15:31.080 --> 15:32.250
but I don't have a current address

15:32.250 --> 15:34.040
and he canceled his cell phone
two weeks ago.

15:34.040 --> 15:35.170
All right, keep digging.

15:35.170 --> 15:36.920
I will turn over every kilobyte
till he is found.

15:36.920 --> 15:38.210
-Thanks.
-

15:38.210 --> 15:40.420
Hey.
You're gonna want to see this.

15:40.420 --> 15:44.080
So you asked us to look at surveillance
near areas that the City Link stops.

15:44.080 --> 15:45.920
We picked this up
from the commuter parking lot

15:45.920 --> 15:47.790
at the Victory Depot this morning.

15:47.790 --> 15:49.420
According to the time marker,

15:49.420 --> 15:52.040
he parks here,
just before bus 290 arrives.

15:52.040 --> 15:53.750
Then he leaves...

15:53.750 --> 15:55.710
And then he returns to his car
a few minutes later.

15:55.710 --> 15:58.920
-So he never got on the bus.
-Nope. Running the license plate now.

15:58.920 --> 16:01.170
He gets back into his car,
he's holding something.

16:01.170 --> 16:02.710
What is that?

16:03.380 --> 16:05.250
-Bottle of water?
-Maybe it's sarin.

16:05.250 --> 16:08.000
He's cleaning his hands
and clothes with it.

16:08.000 --> 16:09.540
Why would he be doing that?

16:09.540 --> 16:11.380
Washing with soap and water
is what you're supposed to do

16:11.380 --> 16:13.420
immediately after
being exposed to sarin.

16:13.830 --> 16:16.580
Okay, our car belongs
to a Charles Senarak.

16:16.580 --> 16:19.540
He lives in Simi Valley
and works at Banning Medical Supply.

16:19.960 --> 16:22.170
And he's a regular
commuter on the City Link

16:22.170 --> 16:25.460
-but didn't ride this morning.
-We need to pay Mr. Senarak a visit.

16:27.580 --> 16:29.540
You saw me sitting in my car?

16:29.540 --> 16:32.620
On surveillance footage
at Victory Station, yes.

16:33.750 --> 16:35.330
Is it a crime to be in my car?

16:35.580 --> 16:37.540
The bus that was attacked
with sarin this morning

16:37.540 --> 16:38.880
stopped at that station,

16:38.880 --> 16:40.880
so we have to look at anything unusual.

16:40.880 --> 16:43.540
Wait, you think I had something to do
with the sarin attack?

16:43.540 --> 16:45.710
We just want to know
what you were doing in your car,

16:45.710 --> 16:48.540
because the bus came and went
while you were still there.

16:48.540 --> 16:52.000
Look, we know that you and your wife
are both City Link commuters.

16:52.000 --> 16:53.750
You both have monthly passes.

16:53.750 --> 16:56.330
You've taken that bus every single day
for the past month.

16:56.330 --> 16:57.790
And yet, today, you both missed it.

16:58.540 --> 17:00.830
Uh, Tracy had an early morning
management meeting,

17:00.830 --> 17:03.170
and I had a late night.

17:03.170 --> 17:05.170
I was trying to clean myself up,
and, um...

17:06.880 --> 17:08.460
I just wasn't paying attention
when the bus left.

17:09.170 --> 17:11.000
What were you doing last night?

17:11.580 --> 17:14.420
Went to a bar. The Old Sea Tavern.

17:15.290 --> 17:17.420
And then for a long drive.

17:24.170 --> 17:25.540
Was anybody with you?

17:26.670 --> 17:28.120
No. I was alone.

17:28.120 --> 17:30.960
You do that often,
go to a bar and drink alone?

17:31.380 --> 17:33.420
No. But I was feeling down.

17:34.120 --> 17:35.290
Mmm.

17:35.290 --> 17:36.330
Why is that?

17:36.790 --> 17:38.540
I found...

17:42.290 --> 17:43.960
It was, uh, my mother's birthday,

17:43.960 --> 17:46.120
and she died a few years ago,

17:46.120 --> 17:48.960
so I was feeling depressed. That's all.

17:48.960 --> 17:52.250
One of your coworkers said that
you were acting strangely today.

17:52.960 --> 17:54.880
I just said I was depressed.

17:54.880 --> 17:58.210
-About your mother.
-Yeah.

17:58.210 --> 17:59.920
Any other reason,

17:59.920 --> 18:03.210
with your work or marriage?

18:06.210 --> 18:09.000
No. Everything's fine.

18:09.000 --> 18:12.120
Look, I'm sorry I'm acting strange
on the day that there's a sarin attack,

18:12.120 --> 18:14.080
but it's just a coincidence.

18:14.080 --> 18:17.120
I had nothing to do with it. Nothing.

18:20.750 --> 18:22.170
Thank you. We'll be in touch.

18:23.460 --> 18:24.500
Thank you.

18:28.250 --> 18:29.500
Thanks.

18:31.880 --> 18:33.500
You think he's telling the truth?

18:33.500 --> 18:35.000
About the sarin attack, yes.

18:35.000 --> 18:37.750
But he's lying about something.
I just can't put my finger on it.

18:37.750 --> 18:39.540
Not much we can do about that, though.

18:40.210 --> 18:41.710
Oh, you'd be surprised.

18:42.580 --> 18:46.000
Garcia, I need you to confirm
Charlie Senarak's alibi

18:46.000 --> 18:48.290
and find out
everything you can about him.

19:57.750 --> 20:00.500
The victim has been positively ID'd
as Johann Geitman.

20:01.170 --> 20:03.880
Wait, the chemist who was fired
from Holder Industries?

20:03.880 --> 20:06.670
Yes. He died of a single
gunshot wound to the head.

20:06.670 --> 20:09.170
The ME says,
based on reversal of rigor mortis,

20:09.170 --> 20:11.170
time of death was 36 hours ago.

20:11.170 --> 20:13.710
About an hour ago.

20:13.710 --> 20:15.420
We got a call about the sound of gunfire.

20:15.420 --> 20:18.170
That's odd. It definitely
doesn't match his time of death.

20:18.420 --> 20:21.290
Well, somebody broke in.
There's glass all over the ground.

20:21.290 --> 20:22.460
Who owns this cabin?

20:22.460 --> 20:24.380
It's a vacation home
for a Hong Kong businessman

20:24.380 --> 20:25.670
who hasn't been here in over a year.

20:25.670 --> 20:27.620
-Any connection to Geitman?
-No.

20:27.620 --> 20:29.960
Maybe Geitman broke in
and was squatting here.

20:29.960 --> 20:32.540
It's possible, but Geitman didn't do this.

20:32.540 --> 20:35.290
He'd have cleaned up the glass
if he was living here.

20:35.290 --> 20:37.500
I think whoever killed Geitman
came in this way.

20:37.500 --> 20:39.420
So the body was found there.

20:41.460 --> 20:44.170
Well, it looks like Geitman camped
out here for a while.

20:44.170 --> 20:47.460
Was he making sarin here?
-I don't see any signs of it.

20:49.880 --> 20:52.460
Whoever killed Geitman
took his computer.

20:52.460 --> 20:54.500
Probably to hide evidence.

20:54.500 --> 20:57.040
Agent, the way we drove up here,
is that the only way in?

20:57.040 --> 20:58.170
Yeah.

20:58.170 --> 20:59.750
Because the only gas station
I remember seeing

20:59.750 --> 21:01.710
was about 25 miles back.

21:01.710 --> 21:04.670
There's a reasonable chance that
whoever killed Geitman stopped there,

21:04.670 --> 21:06.830
so we should pull surveillance footage
if they have any.

21:06.830 --> 21:08.380
I'm on it.

21:11.040 --> 21:13.120
Geitman's former employer,
Holder Industries,

21:13.120 --> 21:15.420
is one of the oldest
chemical companies around.

21:15.420 --> 21:18.750
They were a major supplier of sarin
to the US military in the 1950s.

21:18.750 --> 21:21.960
I know you said all stockpiles
should have been destroyed by 2007,

21:21.960 --> 21:25.210
but what if they weren't

21:25.210 --> 21:26.790
And Geitman may have
known where it was.

21:26.790 --> 21:29.380
The UnSub bought it from him
and then killed him so he couldn't talk.

21:29.380 --> 21:30.580
Which means chances are good

21:30.580 --> 21:32.710
the UnSub has more sarin
than what was used.

21:33.380 --> 21:35.000
We need to deliver the profile.

21:35.000 --> 21:37.750
The recent sarin attack
is a case of domestic terrorism

21:37.750 --> 21:40.830
on a small scale, not unlike
the Boston Marathon Bombing.

21:40.830 --> 21:42.290
We believe that one or two individuals

21:42.290 --> 21:44.250
perpetrated the attack, not a large group.

21:44.250 --> 21:47.620
These individuals may have
splintered off a bigger group, though.

21:47.620 --> 21:50.500
The motive could be revenge
or ideologically based,

21:50.500 --> 21:52.000
but keep in mind,

21:52.000 --> 21:55.080
it is possible that someone is
only using ideology as a front.

21:55.080 --> 21:57.250
We believe a chemist
named Johann Geitman

21:57.250 --> 21:59.170
provided the sarin in the recent attack.

21:59.170 --> 22:01.580
Geitman may have been a supplier
working on his own

22:01.580 --> 22:04.250
or he may have been
a part of a partnership that soured.

22:04.250 --> 22:05.380
We're looking for any information

22:05.380 --> 22:07.000
regarding Geitman's
recent whereabouts,

22:07.000 --> 22:09.380
or any individuals
he may have had contact with.

22:09.380 --> 22:12.000
The fact that the UnSub chose
sarin as his weapon

22:12.000 --> 22:13.830
and is using a time-release device

22:13.830 --> 22:15.750
means that this guy
is criminally sophisticated,

22:15.750 --> 22:17.960
meticulous and extremely patient.

22:17.960 --> 22:19.580
This suggests that he's older,

22:19.580 --> 22:22.580
perhaps in his late 30s, possibly 40s.

22:23.380 --> 22:25.380
Can I have another one, Dad?

22:26.620 --> 22:28.120
Dad?

22:28.540 --> 22:31.210
-What

22:31.210 --> 22:32.830
Yeah. Yeah, sure.

22:32.830 --> 22:35.210
The contained nature of the attack

22:35.210 --> 22:37.540
could mean that
a partnership is falling apart

22:37.540 --> 22:40.540
and that only a portion of the plan
was carried out.

22:44.880 --> 22:46.290
Dad.

22:47.040 --> 22:48.710
Did you get a new phone?

22:48.710 --> 22:50.670
- -Uh... Yeah, yeah, yeah, I did.

22:50.670 --> 22:53.880
Or given the likelihood that
the sarin came from an old stockpile,

22:53.880 --> 22:56.120
this was simply a test of its potency.

22:56.120 --> 22:58.580
Therefore something
much larger in scale is being planned.

22:58.580 --> 23:00.000
The longer this UnSub remains free,

23:00.000 --> 23:02.620
the more emboldened he will be
to launch another attack.

23:02.620 --> 23:05.290
We need to monitor
all modes of public transportation

23:05.290 --> 23:06.960
and increase patrols at airports

23:06.960 --> 23:09.210
and train and bus terminals.
Thank you.

23:09.210 --> 23:12.000
Did you get the laptop?-Yeah.

23:12.000 --> 23:13.920
But you didn't tell me
there'd be a dead man there.

23:13.920 --> 23:16.460
I didn't know.
It doesn't really matter.

23:16.460 --> 23:18.170
It doesn't matter?

23:18.170 --> 23:19.830
You just linked me to a murder.

23:21.580 --> 23:24.080
That's really funny, Charlie.

23:24.080 --> 23:26.710
Are you forgetting
you killed your wife's lover?

23:29.500 --> 23:30.960
Theo Koutranis?

23:31.380 --> 23:32.710
What the hell do you want?

23:32.710 --> 23:34.210
Leave my wife alone.

23:34.210 --> 23:37.580
If you gave her what she needed,
maybe she'd leave me alone.

23:48.210 --> 23:50.120
Just stay calm, Charlie.

23:50.120 --> 23:53.830
As long as you behave,
your secret is safe with me.

23:53.830 --> 23:56.540
What did I do to you

23:56.540 --> 23:58.620
Don't be so melodramatic.

23:58.620 --> 24:00.880
I just want us to help each other.

24:00.880 --> 24:04.420
I need you to go to a warehouse
and pick up a package for me.

24:04.710 --> 24:05.960
Forget it.

24:05.960 --> 24:08.790
15.

24:08.790 --> 24:12.080
Don't you need to take that beautiful
daughter of yours to school?

24:12.580 --> 24:15.000
Okay, honey.

24:15.580 --> 24:17.670
I'm sending you an address.

24:17.670 --> 24:20.250
00 today.

24:24.250 --> 24:25.710
Well, we were right.

24:25.710 --> 24:28.210
Geitman was interested
in Holder Industry's sarin stockpile.

24:28.210 --> 24:29.380
We interviewed his supervisor,

24:29.380 --> 24:31.210
he said he asked about it
two months ago.

24:31.210 --> 24:33.750
Now, although Geitman didn't express
any extremist tendencies,

24:33.750 --> 24:35.750
he was in deep financial trouble.

24:35.750 --> 24:37.250
In addition to the online gambling,

24:37.250 --> 24:39.790
he owed back taxes
and he invested heavily in a company

24:39.790 --> 24:41.380
that eventually went bankrupt.

24:41.380 --> 24:43.040
So he just sold the sarin for the money,

24:43.040 --> 24:45.380
and the UnSub killed him
so he couldn't talk.

24:45.880 --> 24:48.460
So, we reviewed the surveillance footage

24:48.460 --> 24:50.080
from the gas station near the cabin.

24:50.080 --> 24:51.500
You're not gonna believe what we found.

24:51.500 --> 24:55.170
00 P.M.

24:55.170 --> 24:58.540
Let me guess. It was driven by
our very own Charlie Senarak?

24:58.540 --> 24:59.710
Yep.

24:59.710 --> 25:02.040
Garcia, what did you find out
about Charlie Senarak?

25:02.040 --> 25:03.670
Charlie reminds me of the color beige,

25:03.670 --> 25:05.290
not that there's anything wrong
with the color beige,

25:05.290 --> 25:07.710
aside from the fact
that it's the only color I look bad in.

25:07.710 --> 25:12.000
He's worked for the last
14 years as a sales associate

25:12.000 --> 25:13.670
at Banning Medical Supply.

25:14.250 --> 25:16.540
His wife works there, too.
They've been married for 13 years.

25:16.540 --> 25:17.710
Her name is Tracy.

25:17.710 --> 25:20.670
She got a promotion four months ago
to team manager.

25:20.670 --> 25:22.710
They have a 12-year-old daughter,
Jolene.

25:22.710 --> 25:24.670
He has no criminal record.
He has no traffic tickets.

25:24.670 --> 25:28.620
His social media posts are just like...
He's beige.

25:29.000 --> 25:31.250
I don't know.
This guy doesn't fit our profile at all.

25:31.920 --> 25:33.880
But it can't just be a coincidence

25:33.880 --> 25:36.540
he was at the gas station near the cabin.

25:37.250 --> 25:40.830
Garcia, any recent purchases
that stand out?

25:40.830 --> 25:42.620
Handgun

25:43.120 --> 25:44.750
No, nothing I can see.

25:44.750 --> 25:46.420
Except the last three months,

25:46.420 --> 25:49.330
he has a lot of credit card charges
to a marriage counselor.

25:49.330 --> 25:51.040
So he lied about his marriage being fine.

25:51.670 --> 25:55.120
-What's his mother's birthday?-Give me a sec.

25:55.120 --> 25:57.500
January 10th.

25:57.500 --> 25:59.750
And not two days ago like he said.

26:00.380 --> 26:02.330
So what else
is Charlie lying about?

26:23.500 --> 26:25.170
So who was that?

26:27.120 --> 26:29.080
Theo Koutranis' brother.

26:29.920 --> 26:32.420
Theo's missing.
No one knows where he is.

26:39.290 --> 26:40.620
So why is his brother asking you?

26:41.170 --> 26:44.080
Because Theo was a manager
at the Irvine branch,

26:44.080 --> 26:47.290
and we had a regional meeting
on Monday, okay?

26:47.290 --> 26:50.120
He wanted to know if Theo had said
anything about going away.

26:50.500 --> 26:52.170
And why would Theo tell you that?

26:52.170 --> 26:54.830
Because we work together,
which means we occasionally talk.

26:54.830 --> 26:57.620
It does not mean
that we are sleeping together.

26:57.620 --> 27:00.000
-You sure

27:00.000 --> 27:02.420
You want to do this right now

27:03.420 --> 27:05.670
Honestly, I don't think
I can take this anymore.

27:06.540 --> 27:08.000
Maybe it is too late for us.

27:10.290 --> 27:13.330
If you leave, you can't have Jolene.

27:13.330 --> 27:15.540
I won't let you take her away from me.

27:22.620 --> 27:23.960
Go ahead, Penelope.

27:23.960 --> 27:25.620
Uh,
Charlie Senarak isn't beige at all.

27:25.620 --> 27:27.000
He's a verdant green.

27:27.000 --> 27:29.540
A month ago,
he went on this ranty Facebook post

27:29.540 --> 27:31.540
about men who cheat
with married women,

27:31.540 --> 27:33.420
then early yesterday morning
he deleted it.

27:33.420 --> 27:36.330
I was just able to uncover it,
and his Internet search history...

27:36.330 --> 27:39.670
"Hot magma of homicidal rage"
doesn't even begin to cover it.

27:39.670 --> 27:41.790
Maybe Charlie found out
his wife was having an affair.

27:41.790 --> 27:45.250
If that's the case, he could be spiraling
and lashing out at the world.

27:47.000 --> 27:49.620
Thanks, Penelope,
we're at his office now.

27:53.460 --> 27:56.210
Can I help you?
-We're looking for Charlie Senarak.

27:56.210 --> 27:58.170
I'm his wife. Is something wrong?

27:58.170 --> 28:01.380
We're with the FBI.
We're just looking to follow up with him.

28:01.380 --> 28:02.710
Where is he?

28:02.710 --> 28:05.330
He left a half an hour ago.

28:05.330 --> 28:07.920
I think he had a meeting with a client.

28:18.710 --> 28:20.540
I'm Charlie Senarak.

28:21.920 --> 28:23.080
I'm here to pick up a package.

28:23.670 --> 28:25.420
You're not blocking the driveway,
are you?

28:26.080 --> 28:28.210
Um. No. I'm parked out front.

28:29.080 --> 28:30.460
Wait here.

29:05.790 --> 29:07.330
Hello?

29:07.960 --> 29:09.880
Is anyone there?

29:11.040 --> 29:15.250
Sorry, man.
Took me a little while to find it.

29:16.000 --> 29:17.460
Is that it?

29:18.420 --> 29:19.540
Yep.

29:20.460 --> 29:21.540
What's in it?

29:23.000 --> 29:24.120
Beats me.

29:56.420 --> 29:59.040
My phone was in Charlie's desk?
I don't understand.

29:59.040 --> 30:00.290
Your husband's hiding something.

30:00.290 --> 30:02.210
We think he's connected
to the sarin attack.

30:02.210 --> 30:04.420
We just don't know how, exactly.

30:07.170 --> 30:08.330
That's impossible.

30:09.540 --> 30:11.830
That's not like Charlie at all.

30:12.790 --> 30:14.830
You were having an affair, weren't you?

30:20.210 --> 30:23.420
You'd be surprised what someone
with a broken heart will do.

30:25.210 --> 30:28.540
-Who was it with?
-Theo Koutranis.

30:30.790 --> 30:34.250
But I was trying to end it with him.

30:34.250 --> 30:37.500
-Did Charlie know that?
-He thought it was already over.

30:40.080 --> 30:44.620
But Theo was persistent.

30:50.670 --> 30:53.170
-Oh, my God.
-What?

30:53.170 --> 30:55.250
Theo's been missing for two days.

30:55.250 --> 30:58.120
His brother was here earlier
looking for him.

30:58.670 --> 30:59.960
May I?

31:03.080 --> 31:07.040
It looks like Theo sent you a text
two days ago.

31:07.040 --> 31:10.880
"Meet me at the Desert Bloom Inn,
10 P.M., Room 3."

31:12.040 --> 31:14.120
I never... I never got this.

31:14.120 --> 31:17.170
Because Charlie had your phone,
which means that he saw it.

31:17.170 --> 31:19.380
So he knew you were
still having an affair.

31:19.380 --> 31:21.120
Maybe he went to confront Theo.

31:25.380 --> 31:26.880
Mrs. Senarak.

31:30.080 --> 31:33.710
Charlie didn't come home
two nights ago.

31:36.460 --> 31:38.380
He said he was driving around.

31:39.670 --> 31:42.080
That was the night before the attack.

31:43.120 --> 31:45.670
Tell us more about Theo Koutranis.

31:53.040 --> 31:54.710
You think I don't know what's going on?

31:54.710 --> 31:56.120
- -

31:56.500 --> 31:58.580
Are you driving, Charlie?

31:58.580 --> 32:01.960
Pull over.
You don't want to get a ticket, do you?

32:06.460 --> 32:07.620
You're setting me up.

32:07.620 --> 32:09.790
You're making it look like
I'm responsible for the sarin attack,

32:09.790 --> 32:11.830
but you did it. Who the hell are you?

32:11.830 --> 32:13.330
You're imagining things.

32:13.330 --> 32:17.080
No, no, you... You made me
pick up a gas mask and a hazmat suit!

32:17.080 --> 32:19.170
You made me steal a laptop
from a dead man!

32:19.170 --> 32:20.580
And I know who he is now.

32:20.580 --> 32:22.080
Don't do this to yourself.

32:22.080 --> 32:24.250
He's that chemist
who's been all over the news.

32:24.250 --> 32:26.460
Do you think I'm an idiot Do you?

32:26.460 --> 32:29.210
I think you're a man
without any options, Charlie.

32:29.210 --> 32:31.040
No, that's where you're wrong, all right?

32:31.040 --> 32:33.000
You... You think you can set me up?

32:33.000 --> 32:36.000
Just stop.

32:36.000 --> 32:38.880
No, the FBI's offering
a million-dollar reward for information.

32:38.880 --> 32:40.920
And I can give...
I could give them this cell phone

32:40.920 --> 32:42.580
and they can probably
trace it back to you.

32:42.580 --> 32:44.920
All our conversations
have been recorded somewhere.

32:44.920 --> 32:47.210
That's what the NSA does, isn't it?

32:47.210 --> 32:51.000
-They record every conversation!
-You need to calm down.

32:51.000 --> 32:55.380
No! No! You do not get to tell me
what to do anymore!

32:55.380 --> 32:56.790
And I'm not gonna be your patsy!

32:56.790 --> 32:58.710
Shut up, Charlie, and listen to me!

32:58.710 --> 33:00.420
Listen carefully.

33:00.420 --> 33:02.210
I've been watching you all along.

33:02.710 --> 33:05.880
From the very beginning when
you pulled into the Desert Bloom Inn.

33:07.670 --> 33:11.120
You set the wheels in motion
the second you murdered Theo.

33:20.750 --> 33:23.380
There's no way out for you, Charlie.

33:23.380 --> 33:26.170
Do you really think
you're not being watched now?

33:27.670 --> 33:29.170
By the way,

33:29.170 --> 33:32.330
wasn't your daughter wearing
a yellow sweatshirt today?

33:33.710 --> 33:35.210
Jolene!

33:38.710 --> 33:40.290
Talk to me, Penelope.

33:40.290 --> 33:42.460
You were right,
handsome Italian man.

33:42.460 --> 33:45.290
Theo Koutranis is more
than just a lover boy.

33:45.290 --> 33:47.580
His name used to be Theo Martin.

33:47.580 --> 33:51.040
He grew up in the Heaven's Mission
cult compound in southern Utah.

33:51.040 --> 33:54.670
He was one of 50... Fifty illegitimate
children of the cult leader,

33:54.670 --> 33:57.210
who had vehement
anti-government views.

33:57.210 --> 33:59.000
Shades of David Koresh.

33:59.000 --> 34:00.790
Oh, sure. And eight years ago,

34:00.790 --> 34:03.290
he moved here with his half-brother,
Mitchell Crossford.

34:03.290 --> 34:05.080
Uh... Mitchell blogged about launching

34:05.080 --> 34:07.000
terrorist attacks
here in the United States.

34:07.000 --> 34:09.040
They shared an apartment
up until three months ago.

34:09.040 --> 34:10.710
Three months ago
is right around the time

34:10.710 --> 34:13.290
Theo started having an affair
with Tracy Senarak.

34:13.290 --> 34:16.290
What if Theo and Mitchell were
planning a terrorist attack together,

34:16.290 --> 34:18.330
but then Theo started
to have second thoughts?

34:18.330 --> 34:20.540
That is the sound
of you nailing it, brainiac doctor.

34:20.540 --> 34:23.880
Because for the last month,
twice a day, every day,

34:23.880 --> 34:25.540
Mitchell has called Theo.

34:25.540 --> 34:29.250
Theo only answered once,
and the last text Mitchell sent him was,

34:29.250 --> 34:32.500
"You can't run away.
I know everything you do."

34:32.500 --> 34:36.380
Penelope, dig up everything you can
about the brother Mitchell Crossford.

34:36.380 --> 34:37.540
Copy, copy.

34:37.540 --> 34:39.540
The two brothers were planning
a terrorist attack together

34:39.540 --> 34:41.920
until they had a falling-out
over Tracy Senarak.

34:41.920 --> 34:43.580
So you think
Charlie went to confront Theo

34:43.580 --> 34:44.750
about sleeping with his wife?

34:44.750 --> 34:46.920
-It certainly looks that way.
-Theo's been missing for two days.

34:46.920 --> 34:49.290
-There's a good chance Charlie killed him.
-Okay.

34:49.290 --> 34:52.540
"You can't run away.
I know everything you do."

34:52.540 --> 34:55.250
What if Mitchell Crossford
was following his brother around,

34:55.250 --> 34:56.750
trying to bring him back into the fold?

34:56.750 --> 34:59.670
Which means he also could have
witnessed Charlie murder Theo.

35:00.960 --> 35:02.920
So we sent agents to the last location

35:02.920 --> 35:05.000
where Theo Koutranis'
cell phone pinged.

35:05.000 --> 35:06.580
They just found
what looks like a shallow grave

35:06.580 --> 35:09.380
about a mile into the desert
just west of Desert Bloom Inn.

35:09.380 --> 35:11.960
- -I'll go check it out with Rossi.

35:12.540 --> 35:13.670
Go ahead, Garcia.

35:13.670 --> 35:16.790
Mitchell Crossford was definitely
the alpha in the relationship.

35:16.790 --> 35:19.210
He and his mother
left the cult compound.

35:19.210 --> 35:21.250
When he was ten,
they moved to Phoenix,

35:21.250 --> 35:23.710
where he built quite the juvenile record.

35:23.710 --> 35:26.420
Probation officers described him
as cold, intelligent,

35:26.420 --> 35:28.380
and scarily manipulative.

35:28.380 --> 35:29.710
He had extremist views,

35:29.710 --> 35:32.540
and at 16 he ran right back
into the brainwashy arms

35:32.540 --> 35:34.330
of the Heaven's Mission cult.

35:34.330 --> 35:36.620
Where presumably
he found a partner in crime in Theo.

35:36.620 --> 35:38.710
Until Theo fell in love
with Tracy Senarak.

35:38.710 --> 35:40.960
Guys, Tracy rode
the City Link bus frequently.

35:40.960 --> 35:42.790
What if in addition
to testing out his stock,

35:42.790 --> 35:44.710
Mitchell planted
the sarin there to kill her?

35:44.710 --> 35:46.500
Makes sense.
He wanted his partner back,

35:46.500 --> 35:48.210
and there's a good chance
that plan would have worked,

35:48.210 --> 35:49.750
except Tracy didn't
get on the bus that day.

35:49.750 --> 35:51.620
I still don't understand
how Charlie's involved.

35:51.620 --> 35:53.330
Mitchell witnessed
the murder of Theo,

35:53.330 --> 35:55.710
realized he could turn Charlie
into a patsy.

35:55.710 --> 35:57.580
Charlie obviously rides
the same bus as his wife,

35:57.580 --> 35:58.790
so he already looked culpable.

35:58.790 --> 36:01.040
- -Come on! Get out of the way!

36:01.330 --> 36:03.000
If Mitchell is this manipulative,

36:03.000 --> 36:05.380
then he sent Charlie to the cabin
where the dead chemist was found

36:05.380 --> 36:07.330
to make it look like
he had committed the murder.

36:07.330 --> 36:09.210
And then he called in an anonymous tip.

36:09.210 --> 36:11.330
Tracy Senarak said
Theo's brother came in the office

36:11.330 --> 36:12.460
looking for him today.

36:12.460 --> 36:13.620
Why would he do that?

36:13.620 --> 36:15.880
To establish his innocence and an alibi.

36:15.880 --> 36:18.750
An alibi for what just happened?
-Or what he's planning next.

36:18.750 --> 36:21.080
Hey, Garcia,
what are Mitchell's specific views?

36:21.080 --> 36:23.290
He felt the government needed to pay
for what they did in Waco

36:23.290 --> 36:25.330
and to the FLDS prophet Warren Jeffs.

36:26.000 --> 36:28.290
Well, that means
the FBI is enemy number one.

36:28.710 --> 36:30.120
He's coming here.

36:39.250 --> 36:41.250
What are you... Stop!

36:42.330 --> 36:44.960
We have a security breach,
east parking structure!

36:49.170 --> 36:51.420
-Get out of the car!
-Hey, he has my daughter!

36:51.420 --> 36:53.420
She's in the black van!

36:53.420 --> 36:55.540
-You have to help me!
-Get on your knees!

37:14.000 --> 37:17.210
These are the same sarin devices
as the one from the City Link bus.

37:17.580 --> 37:19.120
I didn't do it. I swear.

37:19.120 --> 37:20.830
-We know.
-Look, he's got my daughter.

37:20.830 --> 37:22.750
She's 12.
She's wearing a yellow sweatshirt.

37:22.750 --> 37:24.120
You have to help her, please!

37:24.120 --> 37:25.540
These could go off any second.

37:25.540 --> 37:27.120
55.
The garage is gonna be flooded

37:27.120 --> 37:28.330
with people leaving work in five minutes.

37:28.330 --> 37:30.290
-That's what he's waiting for.
-We need a hazmat decon.

37:30.290 --> 37:31.420
There isn't time.

37:31.420 --> 37:33.620
Evacuate the garage.
Turn off the ventilators and seal it.

37:39.710 --> 37:40.750
We're clear.

37:43.170 --> 37:44.920
-Yeah, Morgan.
-Hotch, there's no one in the van.

37:44.920 --> 37:47.000
Copy that.

37:47.000 --> 37:49.670
We need to evacuate the facility.
There's over 1,000 people here.

37:49.670 --> 37:52.120
Once sarin vaporizes, it's deadly
in the immediate environment,

37:52.120 --> 37:53.790
but it's heavier than air,
so eventually it sinks.

37:53.790 --> 37:55.830
All right, lock down the rest
of the building. Nobody leaves.

37:55.830 --> 37:57.500
No sign of Mitchell Crossford
in the garage,

37:57.500 --> 37:58.710
but he's definitely here.

37:58.710 --> 38:01.670
All right, Colfax, we're going
to need plans of the building.

38:03.380 --> 38:04.790
Talk to me. What's going on?

38:04.790 --> 38:06.330
Garcia, I need you
to tap into surveillance

38:06.330 --> 38:07.500
and find Mitchell Crossford.

38:07.500 --> 38:09.170
He just drove here in a black van.

38:09.170 --> 38:11.290
Got it. I'm reviewing the security tapes.

38:11.290 --> 38:12.830
Okay, I got him.
I got him exiting the van.

38:12.830 --> 38:15.250
He's walking
to a parking garage elevator.

38:15.250 --> 38:16.540
He's got a bag in his hand.

38:16.540 --> 38:17.880
That could be more sarin.

38:17.880 --> 38:19.460
Okay. I'm trying
to find where he went.

38:19.460 --> 38:22.000
We're running out of time.-I'm moving as fast as I can.

38:22.000 --> 38:25.120
Got him. He's on the basement level.
He's walking toward the west elevators.

38:25.120 --> 38:27.170
-Colfax, I need those plans!
-Pulling them up now.

38:27.170 --> 38:29.210
Where did he go? I just saw him
and now I don't see him anywhere.

38:29.210 --> 38:30.620
-Well, keep looking.-Okay.

38:30.620 --> 38:32.040
Here we go.

38:32.790 --> 38:35.120
All right, Crossford loves
being a mastermind.

38:35.120 --> 38:36.500
He'd want to witness
all the chaos he's causing.

38:36.500 --> 38:38.210
There.

38:38.210 --> 38:40.040
We'll split up and cover each floor.

39:37.880 --> 39:39.790
Put your hands on your head.

39:39.790 --> 39:41.960
Put your hands on your head.

39:45.080 --> 39:48.830
Mitchell Crossford, you're under arrest.
You have the right to remain silent.

39:48.830 --> 39:51.210
Anything you say can and will
be used against you

39:51.210 --> 39:52.330
in a court of law.

39:52.330 --> 39:54.080
You have a right to an attorney.

40:36.210 --> 40:38.170
"The world is so unpredictable.

40:38.170 --> 40:40.920
"Things happen suddenly,
unexpectedly.

40:40.920 --> 40:44.210
"We want to feel
we're in control of our own existence.

40:44.210 --> 40:47.500
"In some ways we are,
in some ways we're not.

40:47.500 --> 40:51.790
"We are ruled by the forces of chance
and coincidence."

40:51.790 --> 40:53.250
Paul Auster.

41:03.920 --> 41:05.040
A little light reading?

41:05.460 --> 41:08.460
Just, uh...
I'm revisiting an old favorite.

41:08.460 --> 41:11.080
I take it you prefer Jung to Freud?

41:11.080 --> 41:13.290
Oh, absolutely.
I feel like Freud gave Jung

41:13.290 --> 41:15.880
too hard a time
for his interest in the paranormal.

41:15.880 --> 41:18.170
Speaking of which,
what do you think of Synchronicity?

41:18.170 --> 41:19.710
It's my favorite Police album.

41:19.710 --> 41:23.290
No, I mean, events that seem
significantly related

41:23.290 --> 41:25.790
but have no discernible
causal connection.

41:26.460 --> 41:29.250
The fact that your mom
and the Truck Stop Strangler's mom

41:29.250 --> 41:32.290
were in the same elementary school
class really got me thinking.

41:32.830 --> 41:34.040
-How so?
-I don't know.

41:34.040 --> 41:36.670
It's not odd
that they were in the same class.

41:36.670 --> 41:40.330
What's really strange is that
one would have a child

41:40.330 --> 41:42.120
who grew up to be a serial killer,

41:42.120 --> 41:43.920
the other would have
a child that grew up

41:43.920 --> 41:46.170
to be an FBI profiler,

41:46.170 --> 41:48.830
and that the two of you
would meet someday.

41:50.210 --> 41:53.880
Yeah. So, what's the take-away?

41:54.420 --> 41:55.790
I don't know.

41:56.540 --> 42:00.880
Maybe the events in our lives
were set in motion a long time ago.

42:01.670 --> 42:03.670
There's an old Buddhist saying that,

42:04.250 --> 42:06.120
when you meet your soul mate,

42:06.120 --> 42:08.580
remember that the act
to bring you together

42:08.580 --> 42:10.620
was 500 years in the making.

42:10.620 --> 42:14.790
So, always appreciate
and be kind to each other.

42:14.790 --> 42:17.460
-That's lovely.
-There's a corollary for friends.

42:18.420 --> 42:19.880
When you meet a true friend,

42:19.880 --> 42:24.420
you'll be bound together
through space and time for 500 years.

42:26.170 --> 42:27.880
Which means...

42:28.120 --> 42:30.080
In the year 2200,

42:30.080 --> 42:32.460
I'm gonna get Morgan back
for that practical joke

42:32.460 --> 42:34.170
he played on me last week.

42:34.790 --> 42:36.880
- -Bring it, pretty boy.

42:36.880 --> 42:38.920
I'll be waitin' for you.

42:39.540 --> 42:40.790
I'll be there.
